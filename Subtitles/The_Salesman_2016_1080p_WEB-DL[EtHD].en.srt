1
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:48,260
- Hey, Mr. Etesami!
- Rana, Missy!

2
00:02:48,355 --> 00:02:48,990
Come on out!

3
00:02:49,623 --> 00:02:51,558
The building's about to collapse.

4
00:03:00,092 --> 00:03:02,395
The building's falling apart.
Get out of there!

5
00:03:03,228 --> 00:03:04,897
What's going on?!

6
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:07,765
What are you doing here, honey?
Come here, honey.

7
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:09,870
Why? What's going on?

8
00:03:10,903 --> 00:03:14,306
Mr. Etesami evacuate the building.
It's collapsing. Hurry up!

9
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:17,774
- Let's go, everyone!
- Rana! Rana!

10
00:03:17,976 --> 00:03:20,056
- What's going on, Emad?
- Come here, Rana! Hurry up!

11
00:03:22,945 --> 00:03:25,245
- Let's go, man!

12
00:03:25,978 --> 00:03:29,145
- What's going on, Mr. Fallah?
- I don't know. Just evacuate, man!

13
00:03:30,179 --> 00:03:32,915
Rana! Hurry up! come on!

14
00:03:34,748 --> 00:03:36,683
- What is it?
- Go down! Go, go!

15
00:03:38,116 --> 00:03:41,651
- Nasim! Chop, chop, Nasim!
Mr. Amiri, let's go! Evacuate!

16
00:03:45,284 --> 00:03:49,453
- Emad, son! For God's sake someone help my baby.
- I'm coming, wait.

17
00:03:51,154 --> 00:03:52,554
Here, here, put this on.

18
00:03:52,686 --> 00:03:55,686
- What? Let me come with you.
- No, you can't. Just go down to the alley.

19
00:03:55,825 --> 00:03:58,545
- Go tell everyone to go to the alley.
- Mrs. Samimi! Mrs. Samimi!

20
00:03:58,761 --> 00:04:02,261
- Where's Hossein?
- I can't get him out of there.

21
00:04:08,252 --> 00:04:15,155
- Hossein get up, my boy! The house is coming down.
- Get up, Hossein! Get up!

22
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:19,724
- Emad, come on, everyone's gone.
- Go down to the alley. Go tell everyone.

23
00:04:20,725 --> 00:04:22,445
Mr. Fallah, get everyone down to the alley.

24
00:04:23,558 --> 00:04:26,095
Come on, Hossein! what are they doing?!

25
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:33,197
- Glasses... my glasses...
- I'll bring your glasses.

ThE SALESMAN
Written and Directed by
Asghar Farhadi

27
00:05:10,868 --> 00:05:15,138
- Guys! There's no need
to bring all your stuff.

28
00:05:15,672 --> 00:05:17,941
- We've got everything down in our place.
- Okay.

29
00:05:21,575 --> 00:05:24,510
- I can't find it.
- I don't know, just look around.

30
00:05:24,644 --> 00:05:26,598
- You want me to take these?
- Yeah, thanks a lot.

31
00:05:26,623 --> 00:05:28,690
- I thought you were supposed to
just bring your towel and toothbrushes?

32
00:05:28,715 --> 00:05:30,475
- The towel and the brushes
are in there too.

33
00:05:33,783 --> 00:05:35,783
- Did you lock the car?
- Yeah.

34
00:05:36,323 --> 00:05:37,883
Ah, keys, keys! Gimme the keys.

35
00:05:38,283 --> 00:05:40,283
Here.

36
00:05:41,603 --> 00:05:42,523
Guys!

37
00:05:45,603 --> 00:05:46,562
Hey

38
00:05:46,563 --> 00:05:46,643
Hey Kati Hi.

39
00:05:46,644 --> 00:05:47,562
What's up, Kati?

40
00:05:47,563 --> 00:05:49,162
You're alive?!

41
00:05:49,163 --> 00:05:53,843
The way Sia said the house has collapsed, I thought
we'd have to drag you from under the ruins.

42
00:05:54,643 --> 00:05:56,723
Oh, whoa! what's going on here?

43
00:05:57,243 --> 00:05:59,363
There's smell of gas...

44
00:06:00,323 --> 00:06:01,722
It's from last night.

45
00:06:01,723 --> 00:06:03,683
Well, then, get your stuff.
Let's get out of here.

46
00:06:08,283 --> 00:06:08,783
Hey.

47
00:06:09,283 --> 00:06:10,762
Why did you come up?

48
00:06:10,763 --> 00:06:12,803
Cut off the electricity,
this is dripping.

49
00:06:23,723 --> 00:06:24,798
I can't find the card, man.

50
00:06:24,823 --> 00:06:27,763
Well, see if it's between your
documents and stuff.

51
00:06:28,123 --> 00:06:30,323
Kati, dear, don't go there,
it's dangerous.

52
00:06:31,163 --> 00:06:33,323
Oh, my God!

53
00:06:36,043 --> 00:06:39,183
You could only hear the sobbing of
Mashti Hassan's wife,

54
00:06:39,203 --> 00:06:42,284
sitting alone with her lit lantern
on the stable's roof

55
00:06:42,383 --> 00:06:44,803
and the desperate moans of a cow
from inside the stable.

56
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:47,682
Sir! is it a true story?

57
00:06:47,683 --> 00:06:51,463
True? No, but you could say that
in a way, in Saedi's stories

58
00:06:51,564 --> 00:06:57,662
the scenery, the type of characters,
and relationships are real. Very real.

59
00:06:57,663 --> 00:06:59,143
Sir, how can someone turn into a cow?

60
00:06:59,323 --> 00:07:00,803
Try looking in the mirror.

61
00:07:01,923 --> 00:07:03,103
You think you're funny, huh?

62
00:07:03,703 --> 00:07:06,023
But seriously, Sir,
how does a person turn into a cow?

63
00:07:08,203 --> 00:07:09,523
Gradually...

64
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:12,163
Sir, are we gonna watch the film
of this story too?

65
00:07:12,263 --> 00:07:13,623
Yeah, that's a good idea.

66
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:16,724
Maybe I bring it next time and
we can watch it together.

67
00:07:16,823 --> 00:07:17,243
Yes?

68
00:07:17,343 --> 00:07:18,603
Sir, when can we see your play?

69
00:07:19,003 --> 00:07:20,239
The performance begins next week.

70
00:07:20,264 --> 00:07:24,364
Once we've had a few days to settle in,
I'll definitely invite you all to come.

71
00:07:24,463 --> 00:07:25,583
- Thank you, Sir!
- What's it called, Sir?

72
00:07:25,603 --> 00:07:27,043
"Death of a Salesman",
who's read it?

73
00:07:27,163 --> 00:07:28,323
The enemy!

74
00:07:30,363 --> 00:07:31,882
Jokes aside,
have any of you read it?

75
00:07:31,883 --> 00:07:33,762
Sir, who's the author?

76
00:07:33,763 --> 00:07:34,643
Arthur Miller

77
00:07:34,843 --> 00:07:36,363
Hmm... no, I've never heard of him.

78
00:07:36,883 --> 00:07:38,093
Very good.

79
00:07:38,393 --> 00:07:40,663
Excuse me, boys.

80
00:07:41,243 --> 00:07:42,363
Yes?

81
00:07:43,043 --> 00:07:44,363
Hello.

82
00:07:45,363 --> 00:07:46,363
Yes.

83
00:07:46,603 --> 00:07:52,883
Sorry, I can't talk right now, I'm in class.
If you call back in 10 minutes, I'll be free.

84
00:07:54,423 --> 00:07:57,483
Yeah, with stick shift... Silver...

85
00:07:59,384 --> 00:08:00,584
Sure... that's fine.

86
00:08:01,723 --> 00:08:03,882
Sir, what's your role?

87
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:05,163
I'm the salesman.

88
00:08:05,263 --> 00:08:08,603
- What are you selling, Sir?
- Potatoes.

89
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:10,463
When you come,
you'll see for yourselves.

90
00:08:10,683 --> 00:08:11,922
What's the model, Sir?

91
00:08:11,923 --> 00:08:13,413
- What?
- Your Peugeot 206, you know.

92
00:08:13,423 --> 00:08:15,983
- Why do you wanna know?
- Aren't you selling it, Sir?

93
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:19,663
Sir, his dad's a parking officer,
just tell him to scrap your fines for you.

94
00:08:19,903 --> 00:08:21,823
Do you even commit driving offenses, Sir?

95
00:08:22,383 --> 00:08:24,883
Sir, why do Iranians call BMWs
"Bee-Em-Veh" s?

96
00:08:25,603 --> 00:08:27,163
I didn't hear you.

97
00:08:27,563 --> 00:08:30,243
Why do Iranians call BMWs
"Bee-Em-Veh" s?

98
00:08:30,544 --> 00:08:33,744
- Get out of here!
- Dude, just zip it!

99
00:08:34,683 --> 00:08:39,322
That's alright. He doesn't know,
so he's asking.

100
00:08:39,323 --> 00:08:40,863
I don't know either.

101
00:08:42,683 --> 00:08:45,023
Guys... eh, for your next session...

102
00:08:45,123 --> 00:08:50,903
I want a summary of this story.
I don't want any excuses, like...

103
00:08:50,904 --> 00:08:54,504
"I fell asleep, we had guests",
and... stuff like that.

104
00:09:05,623 --> 00:09:08,023
Mister, could you please
scooch over a bit?

105
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:22,443
Sir, can I sit in front and
this young man sits back here?

106
00:09:50,243 --> 00:09:51,243
Father...

107
00:09:51,963 --> 00:09:53,163
Somebody in there?

108
00:09:54,043 --> 00:09:57,723
No, I think the noise was
from the next door.

109
00:09:58,523 --> 00:10:01,203
- No, no, somebody got in your bathroom!
- No, there's no one there.

110
00:10:01,363 --> 00:10:04,922
It's the next room, there's a party.
These kind of noises are normal...

111
00:10:04,923 --> 00:10:06,723
Can I come out?

112
00:10:08,824 --> 00:10:10,704
There's something moving
in the bathtub, Willy!

113
00:10:14,203 --> 00:10:20,602
Ah, Miss Francis, you better go back to your
room. They must be finished painting by now.

114
00:10:20,603 --> 00:10:22,242
But I can't, I've got to get dressed first!

115
00:10:22,243 --> 00:10:24,663
Yes, you can, you can!
Please!

116
00:10:25,043 --> 00:10:28,522
Biff, this is Miss Francis,
my next-door neighbor.

117
00:10:28,523 --> 00:10:33,063
They were painting her room.
And she asked to come and use the bath.

118
00:10:33,264 --> 00:10:37,764
And I said, that's alright,
So, I let her take a shower here.

119
00:10:37,863 --> 00:10:38,958
You can go back to your room now.

120
00:10:38,983 --> 00:10:40,482
But Willy, I don't have any clothes on!

121
00:10:40,483 --> 00:10:43,263
Please, get out of here!
Go back to your room.

122
00:10:43,863 --> 00:10:45,723
You promised me stockings, Willy!

123
00:10:45,943 --> 00:10:47,703
I have no stockings here!

124
00:10:47,743 --> 00:10:50,423
Why?! You had two boxes of size 9s for me,
and I want them, Willy!

125
00:10:50,803 --> 00:10:53,403
Alright, take one and go.
For God's sake, will you get out a here!

126
00:10:53,904 --> 00:10:54,904
Please!

127
00:10:54,983 --> 00:10:56,003
Go!

128
00:11:08,923 --> 00:11:13,243
I just hope there's nobody in the hall.
I can't go out without any clothes!

129
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:22,923
By the way, are you
football or...

130
00:11:24,963 --> 00:11:26,243
Dammit!

131
00:11:26,963 --> 00:11:28,243
Siavash!

132
00:11:28,943 --> 00:11:30,343
What happened, mom?

133
00:11:30,443 --> 00:11:33,238
I do my best to ignore it
but he keeps getting worse every night!
Sadra, dear, come down, let's go!

134
00:11:33,263 --> 00:11:34,663
Sanam, dear, just ignore him.

135
00:11:34,763 --> 00:11:36,762
He thinks just because I'm playing a whore,
he can do whatever he wants.

136
00:11:36,763 --> 00:11:38,083
What's that got to do with it?

137
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:39,898
Why don't you laugh at
the others then, huh?

138
00:11:39,923 --> 00:11:42,803
- I was laughing at your clothes, not you...
- Shut up! Shut the hell up!

139
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:44,423
Siavash, come here!

140
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:46,883
Sanam, don't be childish on
this final night. Sanam...

141
00:11:47,403 --> 00:11:50,223
- Alright, I'm freaking sorry... I'm sorry.

142
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:54,043
In this cold, rehearsing every night,
with this child. Let's go, honey.

143
00:11:54,843 --> 00:11:56,643
You just had to fuck it up, didn't you?

144
00:11:56,743 --> 00:11:58,018
- What's that got to do with us?
It's your own husband.

145
00:11:58,043 --> 00:12:00,042
Let me take the k...

146
00:12:00,043 --> 00:12:02,042
Let go!

147
00:12:02,043 --> 00:12:04,042
Sanam don't...

148
00:12:04,043 --> 00:12:05,402
I said get off!

149
00:12:05,403 --> 00:12:06,042
I was kidding...
I said get off!

150
00:12:06,043 --> 00:12:07,283
I was kidding...

151
00:12:11,084 --> 00:12:12,964
- I was messing with you.
- Where are you going?

152
00:12:13,683 --> 00:12:19,883
Comes out of the shower with a raincoat, and
says, "How can I go out without any clothes?"

153
00:12:22,803 --> 00:12:24,883
I can't, man, it makes me laugh.

154
00:12:24,983 --> 00:12:26,838
Go after her or she'll get annoyed
and won't come tomorrow.

155
00:12:26,863 --> 00:12:30,623
Don't make me go out without clothes!
I'm shy!

156
00:12:31,323 --> 00:12:33,403
Come on, how can I go out
without any clothes...

157
00:12:33,404 --> 00:12:34,242
Sanam!

158
00:12:34,243 --> 00:12:35,803
The guy's totally nuts!

159
00:12:46,363 --> 00:12:47,162
Did you find a place?

160
00:12:47,163 --> 00:12:51,482
60 sq. metres, 3rd floor, no elevator.
40 mils up front, 600k tomans per month.

161
00:12:51,483 --> 00:12:53,063
- Where?
- Amiratabak

162
00:12:53,123 --> 00:12:56,063
- What sort of a place are you looking for?
- Something temporary...

163
00:12:56,703 --> 00:13:00,623
If we can't find anywhere,
We have to bring our stuff, and
live right in the middle of the stage.

164
00:13:00,763 --> 00:13:02,763
You free tomorrow afternoon?

165
00:13:03,063 --> 00:13:03,963
How come?

166
00:13:04,263 --> 00:13:05,283
I'm taking you somewhere.

167
00:13:05,383 --> 00:13:08,543
Come on guys...
once more from the top, no interruptions.

168
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:13,082
You tired?

169
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:15,082
Nope

170
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:16,922
Oh, you're here too!

171
00:13:16,923 --> 00:13:20,803
Aww kitty! Who's this?

172
00:13:21,204 --> 00:13:22,904
Come here, you!

173
00:13:26,705 --> 00:13:30,305
He's tame... What's up, kitty?

174
00:13:35,483 --> 00:13:36,983
This place is cool!

175
00:14:05,603 --> 00:14:06,763
Babak

176
00:14:08,663 --> 00:14:09,903
Is that the storage room?

177
00:14:11,563 --> 00:14:12,903
- Which one?
- This

178
00:14:13,223 --> 00:14:14,883
No! It's the second bedroom

179
00:14:14,963 --> 00:14:16,803
- Really?!
- Well, yeah.

180
00:14:17,883 --> 00:14:19,583
- Isn't it too small?
- It's a two-bedroom!

181
00:14:19,743 --> 00:14:20,623
So it's good?

182
00:14:20,823 --> 00:14:22,838
You're just two people, what do you
need all this space for anyways?

183
00:14:22,863 --> 00:14:26,563
Watch your mouth, "two people"! Who knows,
maybe we end up being three people...

184
00:14:27,663 --> 00:14:29,923
Rana, is he serious?

185
00:14:30,023 --> 00:14:31,103
No, come on!

186
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:33,103
- He doesn't look like it.
- Why is that?

187
00:14:33,503 --> 00:14:34,823
Is this door locked?
Is it locked?

188
00:14:35,903 --> 00:14:38,983
The previous tenant's stuff is in there;
they're supposed to be collecting it.

189
00:14:39,883 --> 00:14:42,043
Don't be scared kitty, it's just me.

190
00:14:49,003 --> 00:14:50,683
- How long's it been vacant?
- Three weeks.

191
00:14:59,483 --> 00:15:00,803
What are they doing to this city?

192
00:15:01,243 --> 00:15:05,563
I wish we could tear it
all down and start again

193
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:09,643
They've already destroyed and rebuilt it,
and look how it's turned out...

194
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:11,362
Babak?

195
00:15:11,363 --> 00:15:11,803
Yes dear

196
00:15:11,804 --> 00:15:13,482
God have mercy on us.

197
00:15:13,483 --> 00:15:17,643
- When do you think they'll clear their stuff out?
- They promised they'll be here in the next day or two

198
00:15:26,043 --> 00:15:30,683
There's no parking, you'll have to
leave your car on the street.

199
00:15:30,783 --> 00:15:32,962
We don't need parking anyways. we're selling
our car to pay your mortgage down payment.

200
00:15:32,963 --> 00:15:34,282
Who mentioned money?

201
00:15:34,283 --> 00:15:35,303
Well, either way...

202
00:15:35,963 --> 00:15:37,363
Hello Hello Mr Salimi.

203
00:15:37,823 --> 00:15:40,158
One of the good things about this place
are Mr. Shanazari and his wife.

204
00:15:40,183 --> 00:15:41,522
- Hello.
- Hello, how're you doing?

205
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:44,643
- Hello.
- Hello, hello. how do you do Ma'am?

206
00:15:45,883 --> 00:15:47,743
Babak, which one's the storage?

207
00:15:48,343 --> 00:15:49,743
It's here, come, take a look.

208
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:55,543
- Mr Salimi?
- Yes?

209
00:15:55,544 --> 00:15:57,683
The door's open, take a look.

210
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:03,803
Please make sure it doesn't
turn out like the last one.

211
00:16:03,903 --> 00:16:06,698
- No, come on, I know these guys.
- You said you knew the last ones too.

212
00:16:06,723 --> 00:16:07,763
Don't worry about it.

213
00:16:08,363 --> 00:16:11,043
- Babak, what do they do?
- They're my friends, they're into arts.

214
00:16:11,183 --> 00:16:11,743
I hope so

215
00:16:11,863 --> 00:16:13,163
It's okay for a few months.

216
00:16:13,643 --> 00:16:18,283
Just make sure he lets us pay him for it.
No favors.

217
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:21,803
Looks like we've finally caught a break.

218
00:16:27,763 --> 00:16:29,443
Careful, don't rush

219
00:16:30,163 --> 00:16:32,543
You need help, Sir?
- No, you go ahead and bring the rest.

220
00:16:42,663 --> 00:16:44,723
Just be careful not to hit the lightbulb.

221
00:16:46,283 --> 00:16:48,563
Sorry sir, thanks for the help.

222
00:16:50,963 --> 00:16:54,403
- Are the keys here too?
- They took that one room's with 'em.

223
00:17:01,763 --> 00:17:03,663
Where's Ali?

224
00:17:13,043 --> 00:17:13,563
Ali...

225
00:17:13,643 --> 00:17:14,123
Yep?

226
00:17:14,124 --> 00:17:17,063
For God's sake, leave that alone,
I'll call an electrician tomorrow.

227
00:17:17,343 --> 00:17:18,743
It'll only take a second

228
00:17:18,844 --> 00:17:20,163
Leave it, man!

229
00:17:20,943 --> 00:17:24,183
If she'd said, we wouldn't have hired
the truck and the movers.

230
00:17:24,663 --> 00:17:30,283
How was I supposed to know? She sounded so
sure that I didn't think she'd bail on us.

231
00:17:32,663 --> 00:17:33,942
So, what's she saying now?

232
00:17:33,943 --> 00:17:35,843
Hasn't answered
ever since this morning.

233
00:17:36,063 --> 00:17:37,883
Why don't you try from a different number?

234
00:17:38,663 --> 00:17:40,783
Bring your phone Nana.

235
00:17:43,403 --> 00:17:45,963
We really need that room,
we've brought a pickup full our things.

236
00:17:49,783 --> 00:17:51,183
Yes

237
00:17:53,023 --> 00:17:53,883
Okay

238
00:17:54,783 --> 00:17:57,123
He's here if you like to speak to him,

239
00:18:02,883 --> 00:18:03,863
Thanks

240
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:07,263
Says, she's said all
she has to say to you.

241
00:18:07,803 --> 00:18:08,763
Well, what did she say?

242
00:18:09,523 --> 00:18:14,323
She signed the contract on a new place two days
ago, but the landlord bucked at the last moment,

243
00:18:14,523 --> 00:18:17,763
She's looking for a place, but can't come
for her stuff until she finds somewhere.

244
00:18:20,323 --> 00:18:22,803
She said to tell you not to
let anyone touch her stuff. Please.

245
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:29,123
Oh, yeah, and she doesn't want
to talk to you again.

246
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:31,623
Any news? What happened?

247
00:18:31,823 --> 00:18:34,003
I don't know, nothing for now.
Let me take it, Kati.

248
00:18:36,343 --> 00:18:37,683
Ali

249
00:18:38,483 --> 00:18:40,163
- Yes?
- You got a screwdriver in your car?

250
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:50,043
This is enough stuff for a bride's dowry!

251
00:18:50,543 --> 00:18:52,263
I thought it was just
a few bits and pieces.

252
00:18:52,903 --> 00:18:55,359
- Maybe we should leave it...
- It's fine, I'll take responsibility for it

253
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:57,484
Alright, boys, let's move
those things over there.

254
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:07,243
Rana...

255
00:19:08,243 --> 00:19:10,643
mumbling

256
00:19:11,323 --> 00:19:13,122
These are people's belongings

257
00:19:13,123 --> 00:19:16,203
What do you want me to do? It's been
3 days now. She keeps saying...

258
00:19:16,303 --> 00:19:17,938
"I'm coming today, I'll come tomorrow."

259
00:19:17,963 --> 00:19:18,738
What if she shows up?

260
00:19:18,763 --> 00:19:22,002
Well she should've kept her word then.
Never mind. Come on!

261
00:19:22,003 --> 00:19:24,043
Guys, I can't carry anything heavy!

262
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,243
Mr?

263
00:19:43,023 --> 00:19:44,883
Come on, let's eat.

264
00:19:48,243 --> 00:19:49,003
Rana, dear!

265
00:19:49,103 --> 00:19:49,723
Yes dear?

266
00:19:51,343 --> 00:19:53,883
Honey... the charger.

267
00:19:54,684 --> 00:19:58,784
I'll turn into words,
run through your ears...

268
00:19:58,785 --> 00:20:01,285
I'll turn into thoughts,
stick in your head...

269
00:20:01,385 --> 00:20:04,785
I'll be a Benz,
race under your feet...

270
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:08,486
I'll be poverty in your purse...

271
00:20:08,686 --> 00:20:10,786
I'll be a wolf, raid your herd.

272
00:20:51,403 --> 00:20:53,882
You two, go to the door and
bring over one of those boxes.

273
00:20:53,883 --> 00:20:55,682
Hi guys

274
00:20:55,683 --> 00:20:57,362
Are these your 206's car parts, Sir?

275
00:20:57,363 --> 00:20:57,763
Put these in front of the principal's
office, tell the librarian to come see me.

276
00:20:57,764 --> 00:21:00,898
Put these in front of the principal's
office, tell the librarian to come see me.

277
00:21:00,923 --> 00:21:04,562
Very good guys, I want the poem
memorized for next time.

278
00:21:04,563 --> 00:21:04,683
Okay

279
00:21:04,684 --> 00:21:05,443
Okay

280
00:21:05,643 --> 00:21:06,683
Thank you.

281
00:21:07,443 --> 00:21:08,922
Bye, Sir.

282
00:21:08,923 --> 00:21:10,923
Bye.

283
00:21:36,643 --> 00:21:38,003
- Bye, Sir!
- So, long.

284
00:21:40,363 --> 00:21:41,642
Thanks Sir

285
00:21:41,643 --> 00:21:43,643
Goodbye

286
00:21:45,703 --> 00:21:48,863
- Sir, can I say something?
- What?

287
00:21:49,003 --> 00:21:50,763
Sir, I was really pissed off the other day.

288
00:21:51,163 --> 00:21:52,003
Which day?

289
00:21:52,163 --> 00:21:55,523
The day that woman insulted you
in the Taxi.

290
00:21:57,283 --> 00:21:58,722
Was it an insult?

291
00:21:58,723 --> 00:22:02,842
You know, that she said,
she wants to sit in the front seat.

292
00:22:02,843 --> 00:22:07,362
Sir, after you got out of the car,
I told them that you were my teacher.

293
00:22:07,363 --> 00:22:10,483
And that we all love you so much.
Like, all the guys.

294
00:22:11,683 --> 00:22:13,123
What was your first name again?

295
00:22:13,523 --> 00:22:14,503
Amin

296
00:22:15,323 --> 00:22:20,963
Amin, you can be sure, some guy had
done something to her in a taxi before...

297
00:22:21,064 --> 00:22:23,864
to make her think
that way about everyone.

298
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:27,482
Don't worry about it, it's just
the first 100 years that are tough.

299
00:22:27,483 --> 00:22:28,402
See you

300
00:22:28,403 --> 00:22:28,643
Bye See you

301
00:22:28,644 --> 00:22:29,323
Bye

302
00:23:08,443 --> 00:23:09,163
Okay

303
00:23:12,464 --> 00:23:14,264
Of all the time...

304
00:23:15,523 --> 00:23:18,283
I don't know what to do with her.

305
00:23:18,963 --> 00:23:19,683
Who?

306
00:23:19,883 --> 00:23:21,523
This woman

307
00:23:21,803 --> 00:23:26,562
I called to ask when she'll clear her stuff
out. She got angry, started threatening...

308
00:23:26,563 --> 00:23:27,723
Over what?

309
00:23:27,963 --> 00:23:32,002
"Why did you touch my personal things?
those were my private stuff...

310
00:23:32,003 --> 00:23:32,762
I'll sue you.."

311
00:23:32,763 --> 00:23:35,862
Last night I was running around, saving
her stuff from the rain, up until morning.

312
00:23:35,863 --> 00:23:36,938
Her problem's something else...

313
00:23:36,963 --> 00:23:39,503
- Who Babak, the woman?
- Yeah.

314
00:23:40,103 --> 00:23:41,663
When's she coming to get her stuff?

315
00:23:42,263 --> 00:23:43,623
Says, whenever she finds a place.

316
00:23:47,503 --> 00:23:49,883
Sadra darling, come here with me.
Hurry up.

317
00:23:51,523 --> 00:23:55,723
Hurry up guys, the audience will
be in in five minutes.

318
00:24:02,723 --> 00:24:05,642
Emad... Emad, they're coming here
again after the performance.

319
00:24:05,643 --> 00:24:10,503
They've approved 3 of the 6 revisions,
there's another three left.

320
00:24:10,504 --> 00:24:12,278
If you stay around after the performance,
you can talk to them.

321
00:24:12,303 --> 00:24:12,803
Tonight after the performance?

322
00:24:12,803 --> 00:24:13,223
Yes

323
00:24:13,224 --> 00:24:15,082
If it helps, I'll stay.

324
00:24:15,083 --> 00:24:17,298
Sure, or else there's a chance they
might cancel the whole show tomorrow.

325
00:24:17,323 --> 00:24:17,978
How many did they say?

326
00:24:18,003 --> 00:24:19,563
Three... Guys will you please hurry up!

327
00:24:19,763 --> 00:24:20,443
I'll go, then.

328
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:22,358
Won't you wait around?

329
00:24:22,383 --> 00:24:24,983
No, you'll be stuck here
until around midnight.

330
00:24:25,683 --> 00:24:26,723
Take the car, then.

331
00:24:26,823 --> 00:24:28,323
Where are the house keys?

332
00:24:28,523 --> 00:24:29,942
In my coat's pocket.

333
00:24:29,943 --> 00:24:31,343
Have a good performance

334
00:24:31,363 --> 00:24:32,203
You too!

335
00:26:11,043 --> 00:26:13,863
Say, on your way back, if
the supermarket's open...

336
00:26:13,864 --> 00:26:15,824
buy something, we've got
nothing for breakfast.

337
00:26:17,603 --> 00:26:20,443
Yes, I said if it's open. If it's open!

338
00:26:23,243 --> 00:26:25,883
Also, pick up some hand sanitizer.

339
00:26:27,384 --> 00:26:29,484
Maybe I take a shower
until you get here.

340
00:26:29,863 --> 00:26:33,463
No not at all, I'm a mess. I haven't
even wiped off my stage makeup.

341
00:26:36,583 --> 00:26:40,223
I'll be out soon... soon.

342
00:26:41,124 --> 00:26:42,924
Yup... love you, bye.

343
00:27:36,443 --> 00:27:37,202
Anything else?

344
00:27:37,203 --> 00:27:38,203
That's all, thanks.

345
00:27:40,083 --> 00:27:41,242
Be my guest.
Are you paying by card?

346
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:42,763
No, cash.

347
00:27:55,163 --> 00:27:55,962
Hello Ma'am

348
00:27:55,963 --> 00:27:56,463
Hello?

349
00:27:56,563 --> 00:27:58,842
Good evening, I'm your upstairs neighbor.

350
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:02,243
We've just moved in,
could you open the door please?

351
00:28:03,043 --> 00:28:04,123
Thank you.

352
00:28:21,563 --> 00:28:22,203
Rana?

353
00:28:24,243 --> 00:28:25,123
Rana?

354
00:28:28,043 --> 00:28:29,243
Rana?

355
00:28:58,723 --> 00:28:59,682
Rana!

356
00:28:59,683 --> 00:29:00,802
What happened to you?

357
00:29:00,803 --> 00:29:02,402
Please step outside, Sir.

358
00:29:02,403 --> 00:29:05,883
You can't be in here, Sir.
We'll call you when for the CT scan.

359
00:29:07,083 --> 00:29:07,603
Wait outside, please.

360
00:29:07,623 --> 00:29:08,343
Look at me Rana...

361
00:29:08,523 --> 00:29:13,763
Everything's fine,
I'll call you for the CT scan... Please.

362
00:29:15,563 --> 00:29:19,723
Make sure you change the locks
first thing tomorrow.

363
00:29:20,883 --> 00:29:24,483
Why? Did someone get into the house?

364
00:29:24,784 --> 00:29:26,484
I thought she'd fainted,
was dizzy or...

365
00:29:26,603 --> 00:29:27,963
We don't know what happened yet

366
00:29:28,123 --> 00:29:31,683
All of a sudden we heard shouting
and screaming from upstairs.

367
00:29:31,783 --> 00:29:35,563
Not like, normal, not once,
scream after scream...

368
00:29:35,564 --> 00:29:40,364
I told him go upstairs and check, he said,
couples get into fights all the time.

369
00:29:40,663 --> 00:29:45,863
Then we heard some heavy bangs in the stairs, I
told him "Muhammad, God knows, something's up."

370
00:29:45,963 --> 00:29:46,463
Who was it?

371
00:29:46,543 --> 00:29:50,623
By the time we reached the stairs,
we just saw someone fleeing up the street.

372
00:29:50,783 --> 00:29:53,002
I don't know what happened to his foot,
but it had bled all over the stairs.

373
00:29:53,003 --> 00:29:56,703
If I'd caught him, he'd be dead now.

374
00:29:57,403 --> 00:30:00,543
Then we went upstairs and
found your wife unconscious...

375
00:30:00,544 --> 00:30:04,044
there was blood all over the bathroom
floor. I dressed her and brought her here.

376
00:30:04,123 --> 00:30:07,242
Never mind that, thank God
something worse didn't happen.

377
00:30:07,243 --> 00:30:13,443
Woman, do us a favour, go to the ER,
and check if there's any news or something.

378
00:30:14,803 --> 00:30:18,442
Sorry about putting you
to all this trouble.

379
00:30:18,443 --> 00:30:20,883
Have a seat, sit down, son.

380
00:30:26,083 --> 00:30:28,503
Was anything missing from the house?

381
00:30:28,963 --> 00:30:31,723
I don't know.
I didn't notice anything.

382
00:30:32,283 --> 00:30:35,563
I don't think it was a robbery. What
would a thief be doing in the bathroom?

383
00:30:36,643 --> 00:30:38,242
Then who was it?

384
00:30:38,243 --> 00:30:40,482
The guy was one of
that woman's customers.

385
00:30:40,483 --> 00:30:41,723
Who? What woman?

386
00:30:42,243 --> 00:30:44,403
The woman who lived there
before you moving in.

387
00:30:46,023 --> 00:30:49,563
Tell you the truth, she
was kind of messed up...

388
00:30:50,064 --> 00:30:53,364
and I think, the guy came here
on account of her still being there.

389
00:31:06,643 --> 00:31:08,082
Don't shut the door, Ali's coming up

390
00:31:08,083 --> 00:31:08,602
Don't shut the door, Ali's coming up.

391
00:31:08,603 --> 00:31:09,103
Sure

392
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:17,163
Come on, lie down.

393
00:31:23,403 --> 00:31:25,723
Take my sleeve, hold this bit.

394
00:31:28,403 --> 00:31:29,323
Thanks

395
00:31:35,563 --> 00:31:38,283
Wait, let me take off your scarf.

396
00:31:39,723 --> 00:31:41,562
You want me to put
two pillows for you?

397
00:31:41,563 --> 00:31:42,483
No.

398
00:31:50,683 --> 00:31:52,843
Turn off the light, so she can sleep.

399
00:31:53,043 --> 00:31:53,803
Don't turn it off.

400
00:31:55,563 --> 00:31:57,003
Can I get you anything?

401
00:31:57,803 --> 00:31:58,303
No, thanks.

402
00:32:06,363 --> 00:32:07,963
Where are you going, Emad?

403
00:32:09,283 --> 00:32:10,242
Darling?

404
00:32:10,243 --> 00:32:11,722
I said, where are you going?

405
00:32:11,723 --> 00:32:14,562
I'm not going anywhere,
I'll be here. Do you need anything?

406
00:32:14,563 --> 00:32:18,283
Nope. Leave the door open.

407
00:32:28,123 --> 00:32:28,843
Okay, thanks

408
00:32:29,483 --> 00:32:32,203
Look, her blood pressure's low,
be careful when she's walking around.

409
00:32:32,323 --> 00:32:33,203
Thanks for everything.

410
00:32:34,123 --> 00:32:35,842
Sit down guys,
I'll make you some breakfast.

411
00:32:35,843 --> 00:32:36,803
No thanks, I'm fine.

412
00:32:37,843 --> 00:32:40,523
Come on, you haven't eaten
since last night.

413
00:32:43,643 --> 00:32:46,203
Kati, you wanna stay here, and
make soup or something for them?

414
00:32:46,204 --> 00:32:47,338
- You want me to stay?
- You want Kati to stay?

415
00:32:47,363 --> 00:32:48,043
No, no.

416
00:32:48,403 --> 00:32:49,283
Are you sure?

417
00:32:49,883 --> 00:32:52,043
You must be tired.
Go, get some rest.

418
00:32:52,763 --> 00:32:53,803
Call if you need anything.

419
00:32:53,883 --> 00:32:57,202
Really, man, just let us know.

420
00:32:57,203 --> 00:32:59,203
- Thanks again for everything, guys.
- Bye

421
00:35:02,363 --> 00:35:10,363
scrap metal... Iron doors... Aluminum
doors... Fences... Metal dishes... buying...

422
00:35:15,483 --> 00:35:23,483
scrap metal... lamps... Samovars...
anything, bring it over...

423
00:36:46,323 --> 00:36:49,003
Come on, stand here
while I use the bathroom.

424
00:37:02,243 --> 00:37:03,722
What are you doing?

425
00:37:03,723 --> 00:37:06,243
Leave it, I'll wash it myself,
Rana, dear. Leave it.

426
00:37:06,603 --> 00:37:07,503
Come and wash it then.

427
00:37:07,523 --> 00:37:09,123
Alright, turn off the water
and come out.

428
00:37:12,643 --> 00:37:14,683
Then, come and clean it
before I use it.

429
00:37:15,403 --> 00:37:17,483
The police might need to see it.

430
00:37:22,123 --> 00:37:22,803
Yes?

431
00:37:25,123 --> 00:37:26,163
Of course, sorry

432
00:37:26,363 --> 00:37:27,203
Who was it?

433
00:37:27,803 --> 00:37:28,843
A neighbor

434
00:37:29,203 --> 00:37:29,858
What did they say?

435
00:37:29,883 --> 00:37:30,643
I'll be right back.

436
00:37:36,603 --> 00:37:37,923
Sorry

437
00:37:50,803 --> 00:37:53,522
I'm really sorry for all the trouble
you've been put through, ma'am.

438
00:37:53,523 --> 00:37:56,183
Now, come on, don't say that.

439
00:37:56,184 --> 00:37:59,058
I think you should call 110, they'll be
able to track him down through the car.

440
00:37:59,083 --> 00:38:02,483
Yeah, I'll definitely do that.
Anyways, I'll try to find some place...

441
00:38:02,923 --> 00:38:05,858
Here I was thinking, when that woman left
she's taken all her troubles with her.

442
00:38:05,883 --> 00:38:08,163
Have you ever seen
this car's owner around here?

443
00:38:08,603 --> 00:38:11,882
Well, it wasn't like, just
a coupla guys visiting her.

444
00:38:11,883 --> 00:38:15,363
I might have to trouble you again
when the police comes...

445
00:38:15,364 --> 00:38:17,478
if they have any questions
about exactly what you saw.

446
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:19,882
Of course, it's our duty. Would you
like to take my mobile number?

447
00:38:19,883 --> 00:38:20,802
Yes, please.

448
00:38:20,803 --> 00:38:21,922
I'll get going.

449
00:38:21,923 --> 00:38:23,143
Thank you so much, ma'am.

450
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:27,843
They should put an ewer around these guys necks,
and parade them around the city, shaming them.

451
00:38:27,844 --> 00:38:29,643
0912...

452
00:38:48,043 --> 00:38:49,922
Why are you out here? Come in

453
00:38:49,923 --> 00:38:52,163
I'm scared of being
alone in the house.

454
00:38:53,563 --> 00:38:54,763
Where did you go?

455
00:38:56,763 --> 00:38:59,523
I went to thank the neighbors
for last night.

456
00:39:00,283 --> 00:39:01,362
What did they say?

457
00:39:01,363 --> 00:39:02,663
Nothing.

458
00:39:02,723 --> 00:39:04,322
They asked how you were.

459
00:39:04,323 --> 00:39:07,883
You didn't tell Kati and the guys
what happened, did you?

460
00:39:08,043 --> 00:39:09,123
No.

461
00:39:10,003 --> 00:39:11,643
Okay, I'm going to
the police station.

462
00:39:12,283 --> 00:39:15,323
We have to file a complaint
for them to start looking for the guy.

463
00:39:15,643 --> 00:39:17,522
How will they find him?

464
00:39:17,523 --> 00:39:19,362
He left his pickup behind.

465
00:39:19,363 --> 00:39:23,403
His mobile too,
but it's disconnected.

466
00:39:25,843 --> 00:39:27,203
Who was he, Emad?

467
00:39:30,003 --> 00:39:33,763
The neighbors are saying the woman
who lived here before us was shady.

468
00:39:34,443 --> 00:39:38,363
The scumbag must've been
one of her customers.

469
00:39:38,364 --> 00:39:39,564
Came here on account of her.

470
00:39:41,603 --> 00:39:43,363
Do you remember what he looked like?

471
00:39:43,883 --> 00:39:45,083
No

472
00:39:45,723 --> 00:39:47,423
Didn't you get a look at him?

473
00:39:56,003 --> 00:39:58,103
It's cold.
Come inside, you'll catch a cold.

474
00:40:11,203 --> 00:40:12,723
Gimme that.

475
00:40:19,203 --> 00:40:21,323
Who helped me out of the bathroom?

476
00:40:23,283 --> 00:40:24,963
One of the neighbors.

477
00:40:25,163 --> 00:40:26,542
Which one?

478
00:40:26,543 --> 00:40:28,723
I don't know, just forget it.

479
00:40:32,283 --> 00:40:36,083
Eat your breakfast.
and then go get some rest.

480
00:40:38,803 --> 00:40:43,363
I can't. As soon as I close my eyes
that scene comes to my mind.

481
00:40:52,483 --> 00:40:54,323
How did he get in?

482
00:40:56,603 --> 00:40:59,403
I opened the door,
I thought it was you.

483
00:41:00,323 --> 00:41:04,923
I came out of the bathroom,
buzzed him in, and then went back.

484
00:41:12,123 --> 00:41:15,923
I was shampooing my hair when
I realised someone had come in.

485
00:41:17,403 --> 00:41:20,643
He put his hand in my hair from behind
and I thought it was you.

486
00:41:22,123 --> 00:41:25,183
But then I saw his hands
and after that it's blank.

487
00:41:40,403 --> 00:41:41,643
Rana...

488
00:41:42,563 --> 00:41:45,363
Darling, have some breakfast.

489
00:41:51,083 --> 00:41:52,203
Rana, dear...

490
00:41:54,403 --> 00:41:55,563
Sweetie...

491
00:42:51,603 --> 00:42:53,363
What about tonight's performance?

492
00:42:54,563 --> 00:42:56,563
I called and told them to cancel it.

493
00:42:56,763 --> 00:42:57,922
No, call and say I'm coming.

494
00:42:57,923 --> 00:42:59,203
How? In this condition of yours?

495
00:42:59,883 --> 00:43:01,943
It's harder for me to stay at home.

496
00:43:07,563 --> 00:43:11,523
Put this on, let's go to the police station. We
might get held up there for a while anyways.

497
00:43:11,963 --> 00:43:13,603
No, leave it.
Let's not go to the station.

498
00:43:13,763 --> 00:43:15,123
We can't just do nothing!

499
00:43:16,803 --> 00:43:22,323
I don't want to have to go there and tell a
bunch of officers or whoever what happened.

500
00:43:23,043 --> 00:43:25,843
Did something happen
that you can't tell?

501
00:43:27,043 --> 00:43:27,962
No.

502
00:43:27,963 --> 00:43:30,723
Then, you don't have to say anything.
I'll tell 'em myself.

503
00:43:31,923 --> 00:43:33,323
I can't, it'll be too much.

504
00:43:43,923 --> 00:43:45,923
No, this isn't foolish talk, Linda.

505
00:43:46,203 --> 00:43:50,003
When I'm walking in the street,
I clearly feel these things...

506
00:43:50,104 --> 00:43:54,504
They pass me by, but it's as if they're
laughing at me with their eyes.

507
00:43:54,603 --> 00:43:58,083
Why? Why would they laugh at you?
Don't talk that way about yourself, Willy.

508
00:43:58,843 --> 00:44:01,363
Sometimes they pass me by
as if I don't even exist.

509
00:44:02,443 --> 00:44:06,603
As though nobody sees me.
Nobody notices me. Nothing.

510
00:44:11,923 --> 00:44:13,163
Linda?

511
00:44:20,763 --> 00:44:25,443
How long are you going to spend
repairing those socks, huh?

512
00:44:25,963 --> 00:44:28,123
You know it makes me angry.

513
00:44:28,124 --> 00:44:32,124
At least don't do it while I'm home,
talking to you. Okay?

514
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:43,683
Okay, we'll talk about something else,
for example my income.

515
00:44:44,243 --> 00:44:50,323
My never-changing income.
God, this is really ridiculous.

516
00:44:50,463 --> 00:44:52,778
What's wrong with you?
why aren't you saying your lines?

517
00:44:52,803 --> 00:44:58,083
Willy, darling, you're the most
handsome man in the world to me.

518
00:45:01,523 --> 00:45:06,722
You always say this to me, Linda, always,
but it doesn't help me at all.

519
00:45:06,723 --> 00:45:09,082
I'll never be able to make you happy,
do you know why?

520
00:45:09,083 --> 00:45:13,323
Because I'm just a salesman.
I'm nothing! I'm nothing, Linda!

521
00:45:13,443 --> 00:45:18,003
But I always tried...
why are you crying, anyways?

522
00:45:21,883 --> 00:45:23,403
Wait, where are you going?

523
00:45:24,363 --> 00:45:25,883
Linda, come back...

524
00:45:31,203 --> 00:45:35,683
Sorry, I have to stop the play.
I apologize to you all.

525
00:45:36,043 --> 00:45:42,523
My wife, the other actor, isn't feeling well.
Please give us a ten minute intermission. Sorry.

526
00:45:45,923 --> 00:45:47,442
Can you carry on?

527
00:45:47,443 --> 00:45:51,403
What do you mean, Kati? Can't you see
she's not well? Go on, cancel it.

528
00:45:51,483 --> 00:45:54,243
Do you wanna go to the other room
and lie down a little?

529
00:45:54,443 --> 00:45:58,003
Ali right, guys, let's just clear the room.
She's not well.

530
00:46:00,323 --> 00:46:02,162
Sanam, dear.

531
00:46:02,163 --> 00:46:04,042
I'm coming.

532
00:46:04,043 --> 00:46:06,043
Can I get you anything?

533
00:46:11,683 --> 00:46:12,923
Kati darling...

534
00:46:13,363 --> 00:46:15,283
Go and cancel the show

535
00:46:25,283 --> 00:46:27,283
What happened there?

536
00:46:31,203 --> 00:46:35,203
The way someone in the audience
was staring at me bothered me.

537
00:46:37,883 --> 00:46:41,683
The audience have come to watch the play,
of course they'll be looking at you.

538
00:46:41,723 --> 00:46:44,203
Looked at me just like that guy.

539
00:46:49,963 --> 00:46:51,922
I thought you said you didn't see him.

540
00:46:51,923 --> 00:46:56,123
I'm really unwell, I just
don't know what to do.

541
00:46:59,123 --> 00:47:00,802
Babak, come here a minute.

542
00:47:00,803 --> 00:47:02,323
Coming...

543
00:47:10,523 --> 00:47:12,323
Is she feeling better?

544
00:47:13,083 --> 00:47:15,823
Goddammit, man,
what can I say to you...?

545
00:47:15,824 --> 00:47:19,624
Don't you think you had to let me know about
the kind of people who used to live in there?

546
00:47:19,783 --> 00:47:21,442
- What's happened?
- You're supposed to be my friend

547
00:47:21,443 --> 00:47:25,323
Seriously, what's happened?
What is it to you who lived there before?

548
00:47:25,563 --> 00:47:28,323
That apartment's infamous
in the whole neighborhood.

549
00:47:28,643 --> 00:47:29,903
Who's said such a thing?

550
00:47:30,003 --> 00:47:33,762
Let's say nobody's said anything, why isn't
this woman coming to collect her stuff?

551
00:47:33,763 --> 00:47:36,743
I just wanted to help.

552
00:47:36,744 --> 00:47:40,244
Remember the state you were in, last week?
Ready to sleep on the set?

553
00:47:40,343 --> 00:47:43,223
Regardless, should you have hidden
that woman's line of work from me?

554
00:47:43,403 --> 00:47:44,263
What hiding?

555
00:47:44,403 --> 00:47:46,983
Well, yeah. Did you tell me or not?

556
00:47:47,103 --> 00:47:52,602
Was I supposed to pass on to you some
unfounded gossip? To upset you?

557
00:47:52,603 --> 00:47:54,842
Well, what's going, anyways?
What's this all about?

558
00:47:54,843 --> 00:47:56,242
Babak, I'm going

559
00:47:56,243 --> 00:47:56,883
I'm coming.

560
00:47:57,083 --> 00:48:00,163
Go take a look at Rana,
you'll see what this is all about.

561
00:48:00,243 --> 00:48:02,603
They said she slipped
in the bathroom.

562
00:48:05,723 --> 00:48:09,083
We said right in front of you
we might be having a kid in that place.

563
00:48:09,184 --> 00:48:10,858
And you didn't say a word, what kind of...

564
00:48:10,883 --> 00:48:12,963
You were joking!

565
00:48:13,603 --> 00:48:16,282
If we weren't joking,
would you have told us?

566
00:48:16,283 --> 00:48:19,442
Told you what?!

567
00:48:19,443 --> 00:48:22,303
Put yourself in my shoes,
the same room we sleep in, each night...

568
00:48:22,304 --> 00:48:26,804
how many strange men
have been with that woman.

569
00:48:26,883 --> 00:48:31,522
Don't take it so hard on yourself.
I haven't cashed your check yet.

570
00:48:31,523 --> 00:48:38,323
Whenever you find another place whose previous
tenants had your approval, you can move out.

571
00:48:49,443 --> 00:48:49,962
Hello

572
00:48:49,963 --> 00:48:50,363
Hello Hello

573
00:48:50,363 --> 00:48:50,763
Hello

574
00:48:50,764 --> 00:48:51,483
How are you doing

575
00:48:51,643 --> 00:48:56,482
Be careful not to slip on the
stairs Mrs Shahnazari, they're wet.

576
00:48:56,483 --> 00:49:03,842
I was actually going to ask the cleaner
to come early and sort these out.

577
00:49:03,843 --> 00:49:08,082
But, I thought you'd want to report it,
the police might want to see them.

578
00:49:08,083 --> 00:49:10,803
Well, it wasn't such a big deal.

579
00:49:11,083 --> 00:49:18,043
You wouldn't say that, if you'd been there and seen
the state your wife was in, on the bathroom floor.

580
00:49:18,763 --> 00:49:25,922
When Mr. Alimoradi opened the bathroom door,
he thought, God forbid, your wife was dead.

581
00:49:25,923 --> 00:49:28,723
Say hello from me.

582
00:49:34,363 --> 00:49:36,003
Get up, I've made some breakfast for you.

583
00:49:36,243 --> 00:49:37,282
I'm heading out.

584
00:49:37,283 --> 00:49:38,043
Wait.

585
00:49:43,883 --> 00:49:46,282
Wait, I'll get ready and come with you.

586
00:49:46,283 --> 00:49:48,243
Where to? I have class.

587
00:49:48,323 --> 00:49:50,003
I know, I'll wait in the car.

588
00:49:50,283 --> 00:49:52,843
It's not just an hour or two,
you'll get tired.

589
00:49:53,043 --> 00:49:54,403
Then don't go today.

590
00:49:54,423 --> 00:49:55,202
What?

591
00:49:55,203 --> 00:49:57,523
I said, don't go today.

592
00:49:57,843 --> 00:50:00,402
Let's say I don't,
what about tomorrow then?

593
00:50:00,403 --> 00:50:03,002
The day after tomorrow?
It's not gonna work.

594
00:50:03,003 --> 00:50:05,723
I can't stay here alone.

595
00:50:06,723 --> 00:50:09,603
I said, I don't want
to be here alone.

596
00:50:09,963 --> 00:50:16,683
What can I do? You want me to get you a
ticket to visit your parents for a few days?

597
00:50:17,363 --> 00:50:18,923
Looking like this?

598
00:50:20,403 --> 00:50:22,023
I've made up my mind...

599
00:50:22,024 --> 00:50:27,124
we either have to go to the police,
or forget this altogether.

600
00:50:27,223 --> 00:50:30,682
Okay forget it, but let's look for
a new apartment right from today.

601
00:50:30,683 --> 00:50:32,162
Okay, we'll start looking.

602
00:50:32,163 --> 00:50:36,002
But until we find somewhere,
you need to try and pick yourself up.

603
00:50:36,003 --> 00:50:37,962
What do you mean?
It's not something I can control.

604
00:50:37,963 --> 00:50:42,003
You taking your pills and not staying up all night
getting worked up about it, is up to you, isn't it?

605
00:50:42,403 --> 00:50:46,563
Go take a shower, I'll wait here.

606
00:50:47,883 --> 00:50:49,803
I don't want to go in that bathroom.

607
00:50:53,723 --> 00:50:55,642
I'll drop you off at a friend's place.
Use theirs.

608
00:50:55,643 --> 00:50:58,323
Go and tell them we've
come to take a shower?

609
00:50:58,543 --> 00:51:01,063
What do you want me to do?

610
00:51:02,763 --> 00:51:04,683
You keep changing your mind.

611
00:51:05,363 --> 00:51:10,242
At night you tell me not to come near you, then
in the morning you tell me not to leave you.

612
00:51:10,243 --> 00:51:12,162
Tell me what to do and I'll do it.

613
00:51:12,163 --> 00:51:12,802
Just go, you're late

614
00:51:12,803 --> 00:51:19,243
It'll take a coupla weeks to find a place. What?
You're not gonna wash up with that wound of yours?

615
00:51:37,683 --> 00:51:39,723
I love you.

616
00:51:41,963 --> 00:51:44,722
Just think, it could've been worse.

617
00:51:44,723 --> 00:51:49,642
What if a piece of glass had gone in your eye,
or your head had been hit harder? then...

618
00:51:49,643 --> 00:51:51,683
then what the hell would I have done?

619
00:51:52,203 --> 00:51:54,163
I wish my head had been hit harder.

620
00:51:56,003 --> 00:51:59,083
God forbid! Honey,
don't say things like that.

621
00:52:58,443 --> 00:53:00,403
Hello, Mr. Etesami.

622
00:53:12,483 --> 00:53:15,243
Hello Sir, how are you doing?

623
00:53:15,883 --> 00:53:18,283
Mr. Yeganeh gave me these books
to give them to you.

624
00:53:19,203 --> 00:53:21,683
Be quiet. What's so funny?

625
00:53:24,123 --> 00:53:25,242
Why?

626
00:53:25,243 --> 00:53:27,763
He said they're not suitable for kids.

627
00:53:28,483 --> 00:53:30,203
Quiet!

628
00:53:31,483 --> 00:53:34,443
Mr. Yeganeh decided these
weren't suitable for the kids?!

629
00:53:35,843 --> 00:53:37,643
Go, throw them in the bin.

630
00:53:37,843 --> 00:53:38,562
Why the bin?

631
00:53:38,563 --> 00:53:40,563
Just throw them away.

632
00:53:51,563 --> 00:53:52,682
Give me your phone.

633
00:53:52,683 --> 00:53:53,962
I don't have a phone, Sir.

634
00:53:53,963 --> 00:53:54,682
Give it to me.

635
00:53:54,683 --> 00:53:55,803
I don't have a cell.

636
00:53:56,363 --> 00:53:58,003
Sir, wait a minute.

637
00:54:01,483 --> 00:54:02,362
Give it to me.

638
00:54:02,363 --> 00:54:03,843
Sir, there's nothing in it about you.

639
00:54:03,963 --> 00:54:04,762
I want to see what you have

640
00:54:04,763 --> 00:54:05,682
I've deleted it

641
00:54:05,683 --> 00:54:07,042
Let me see it

642
00:54:07,043 --> 00:54:08,842
Sir please, I've deleted it

643
00:54:08,843 --> 00:54:11,883
Sir, I have private photos in there

644
00:54:12,123 --> 00:54:13,322
Put your hand down

645
00:54:13,323 --> 00:54:14,603
That's not fair

646
00:54:16,283 --> 00:54:17,603
Mr Etesami?

647
00:54:19,123 --> 00:54:20,523
Sir?

648
00:54:22,123 --> 00:54:26,123
I have personal things on there.
I deleted the video.

649
00:54:28,123 --> 00:54:30,323
On my mother's life, I deleted it

650
00:54:30,563 --> 00:54:34,642
Sir, send it on Telegram, so that everyone
can see. It's much better than this movie.

651
00:54:34,643 --> 00:54:37,523
I'll kick you out of the class,
if you say another word.

652
00:54:38,003 --> 00:54:38,922
Mr. Etesami!

653
00:54:38,923 --> 00:54:39,522
Sorry, Sir

654
00:54:39,523 --> 00:54:40,402
You stay out of this!

655
00:54:40,403 --> 00:54:41,282
Mr Etesami?

656
00:54:41,283 --> 00:54:43,263
I mean all of you.

657
00:54:43,264 --> 00:54:44,764
I'm talking to him.

658
00:54:45,243 --> 00:54:46,723
I deleted it

659
00:54:47,643 --> 00:54:48,723
Please

660
00:54:52,403 --> 00:54:55,923
Call your father to come to the school and see
the kind of photos you have on your cell.

661
00:54:57,763 --> 00:54:59,843
His dad's dead, Sir.

662
00:55:53,163 --> 00:55:54,722
Hi, sorry about that

663
00:55:54,723 --> 00:55:57,303
Hi, no problem.

664
00:55:57,304 --> 00:56:01,304
If it's a hassle for you to keep moving it,
then you can leave it in the corner.

665
00:56:00,403 --> 00:56:01,482
Next to the boiler room.

666
00:56:01,483 --> 00:56:04,842
When my husband gets back
he'll move it to a better place.

667
00:56:04,843 --> 00:56:08,242
I don't want you to have to keep
going up and down the stairs.

668
00:56:08,243 --> 00:56:11,482
I'm going out for a couple of hours
you can take my spot.

669
00:56:11,483 --> 00:56:13,522
Don't worry,
I'll find a better place for it.

670
00:56:13,523 --> 00:56:15,042
Suit yourself.

671
00:56:15,043 --> 00:56:15,323
Sorry

672
00:56:15,324 --> 00:56:17,882
If you give me the keys, I can do it

673
00:56:17,883 --> 00:56:18,563
Thanks

674
00:56:20,843 --> 00:56:24,642
My wife said, you're not
going to report it.

675
00:56:24,643 --> 00:56:25,282
No.

676
00:56:25,283 --> 00:56:28,602
You're doing the right thing, they won't
do anything, even if they catch him.

677
00:56:28,603 --> 00:56:34,243
And you'll have to explain over and over
why you opened the door

678
00:56:34,244 --> 00:56:36,644
plus trekking back
and forth to the court.

679
00:56:36,743 --> 00:56:38,562
Endless hassle for nothing

680
00:56:38,563 --> 00:56:42,962
But he'll probably be back for his car.
Please, call me if he shows up.

681
00:56:42,963 --> 00:56:44,963
I'll sort out that bastard.

682
00:56:58,043 --> 00:57:01,602
I'll take mine out and
then come and park yours.

683
00:57:01,603 --> 00:57:03,362
There's no need,
I'll do it myself.

684
00:57:03,363 --> 00:57:04,843
Okay, then, goodbye.
Thanks.

685
00:57:05,523 --> 00:57:07,163
Goodbye

686
00:57:35,043 --> 00:57:35,842
How's it going?

687
00:57:35,843 --> 00:57:38,202
Hey, you okay?
Is Rana here?

688
00:57:38,203 --> 00:57:39,602
No, wasn't she with you?

689
00:57:39,603 --> 00:57:40,722
She's coming on her own

690
00:57:40,723 --> 00:57:42,523
Any news about the guy?

691
00:57:45,963 --> 00:57:47,443
Who?

692
00:57:48,723 --> 00:57:51,563
Babak had heard some things
from your neighbors.

693
00:57:54,363 --> 00:57:55,922
Where is he? Is he here?

694
00:57:55,923 --> 00:57:57,002
Babak?

695
00:57:57,003 --> 00:57:58,763
Yep, he's back there.

696
00:58:06,003 --> 00:58:07,203
Hi

697
00:58:07,323 --> 00:58:08,122
Hi

698
00:58:08,123 --> 00:58:09,803
Why didn't you tell me yesterday?

699
00:58:11,123 --> 00:58:12,442
What should I have told you?

700
00:58:12,443 --> 00:58:14,563
About the man turning up
the other night.

701
00:58:15,883 --> 00:58:17,483
How's Rana?

702
00:58:18,003 --> 00:58:19,763
The neighbors told you

703
00:58:22,003 --> 00:58:24,082
They're also worried...

704
00:58:24,083 --> 00:58:26,282
Tell 'em nothing happened,
the guy just barged in.

705
00:58:26,283 --> 00:58:28,442
Then why are you keeping his pickup?

706
00:58:28,443 --> 00:58:30,443
Shahnazari said it's in the parking lot.

707
00:58:30,763 --> 00:58:35,642
Tell them we'll be gone soon
we're looking for a new place.

708
00:58:35,643 --> 00:58:37,522
Where will you go?

709
00:58:37,523 --> 00:58:40,043
I won't let you

710
00:58:40,283 --> 00:58:44,243
Can you find that previous tenant
and arrange a meeting for me?

711
00:58:44,923 --> 00:58:46,042
Why?

712
00:58:46,043 --> 00:58:48,042
I wanna talk to her.

713
00:58:48,043 --> 00:58:50,042
Ask her why she did this

714
00:58:50,043 --> 00:58:50,963
Did what?

715
00:58:51,363 --> 00:58:53,042
Did what?

716
00:58:53,043 --> 00:58:55,682
Sent this thug to our house

717
00:58:55,683 --> 00:58:56,802
Why would she do that?

718
00:58:56,803 --> 00:59:00,562
You said yourself, she made threats
about us touching her stuff.

719
00:59:00,563 --> 00:59:05,523
She's nothing like that. She hasn't taken her
stuff because she still hasn't found a place.

720
00:59:05,524 --> 00:59:08,024
She was just annoyed with me that day.

721
00:59:09,043 --> 00:59:10,163
Hello

722
00:59:11,123 --> 00:59:12,762
Feeling better?

723
00:59:12,763 --> 00:59:14,803
Yep, I'm fine thanks

724
00:59:23,043 --> 00:59:25,123
Did you tell the guys?

725
00:59:25,483 --> 00:59:26,202
No

726
00:59:26,203 --> 00:59:27,802
Then how do they know?

727
00:59:27,803 --> 00:59:30,482
One of the neighbor had called Babak.

728
00:59:30,483 --> 00:59:32,323
I'm not sure what they said

729
00:59:33,363 --> 00:59:36,063
Emad, get dressed and
come for the make up.

730
00:59:38,963 --> 00:59:40,883
My outfit's not here

731
00:59:41,403 --> 00:59:43,843
Kati's going to take your place tonight.

732
00:59:53,883 --> 00:59:55,722
And you accepted, just like that?

733
00:59:55,723 --> 00:59:57,883
What can I do?
It's not up to me.

734
00:59:58,003 --> 01:00:01,082
The director wanted her
to replace you tonight.

735
01:00:01,083 --> 01:00:04,442
If you're alright, and you can do it,
I'll go talk to her.

736
01:00:04,443 --> 01:00:06,123
No, I don't want to

737
01:00:07,043 --> 01:00:09,203
Have you started house hunting?

738
01:00:09,963 --> 01:00:11,683
No, I will do

739
01:00:13,123 --> 01:00:14,282
As soon as I get time

740
01:00:14,283 --> 01:00:17,882
When you get time! Like it doesn't
matter how I feel in that place!

741
01:00:17,883 --> 01:00:19,362
You haven't done anything

742
01:00:19,363 --> 01:00:20,803
Huh?

743
01:00:22,483 --> 01:00:25,282
I want us to go to the police,
but you won't let me. What do you mean?

744
01:00:25,283 --> 01:00:28,842
You said you'd drop by the school,
find a substitute teacher, and pick me up.

745
01:00:28,843 --> 01:00:31,463
I couldn't find anyone
to cover my class.

746
01:00:38,763 --> 01:00:39,763
Auntie?

747
01:00:40,203 --> 01:00:41,762
Yes Baby?

748
01:00:41,763 --> 01:00:44,483
Why aren't you acting tonight?

749
01:00:45,163 --> 01:00:47,322
I'm not feeling well tonight, darling.

750
01:00:47,323 --> 01:00:49,642
Why did you come here then?

751
01:00:49,643 --> 01:00:51,962
I get bored at home

752
01:00:51,963 --> 01:00:53,442
What?

753
01:00:53,443 --> 01:00:55,803
I get bored at home

754
01:00:56,403 --> 01:01:01,323
Well, I get bored here.

755
01:01:03,443 --> 01:01:06,323
Would you like to come
to our house this evening?

756
01:01:06,683 --> 01:01:08,722
Do you have Spongebob?

757
01:01:08,723 --> 01:01:10,962
No, but we can go buy it on the way home.

758
01:01:10,963 --> 01:01:13,522
From tomorrow you really
need to perform again.

759
01:01:13,523 --> 01:01:17,723
Everything's Topsy turvy.
Everybody's making mistakes.

760
01:01:18,923 --> 01:01:20,162
Why?

761
01:01:20,163 --> 01:01:22,162
I don't know, everyone's upset

762
01:01:22,163 --> 01:01:24,562
You're better now,
you should act again tomorrow.

763
01:01:24,563 --> 01:01:25,202
Mum?

764
01:01:25,203 --> 01:01:25,962
Darling?

765
01:01:25,963 --> 01:01:27,082
Can I go to Auntie's house?

766
01:01:27,083 --> 01:01:28,002
No, baby.

767
01:01:28,003 --> 01:01:32,882
Let him stay with me tonight, I'm alone.
I'll bring him with me tomorrow.

768
01:01:32,883 --> 01:01:37,743
He can't, his dad's coming to pick him up
to go to his house tomorrow.

769
01:01:41,243 --> 01:01:43,963
Well, his Dad can pick him up
from our place.

770
01:01:49,003 --> 01:01:50,402
You wanna go?

771
01:01:50,403 --> 01:01:51,243
Yes!

772
01:01:51,483 --> 01:01:53,482
You won't be a nuisance for Auntie Rana?

773
01:01:53,483 --> 01:01:55,083
He won't.

774
01:01:55,323 --> 01:01:58,443
Tell Emad we're taking the car.

775
01:01:59,523 --> 01:02:01,643
I'll bring his things over.

776
01:02:07,003 --> 01:02:08,282
I need to pee, auntie.

777
01:02:08,283 --> 01:02:10,283
I know, go on, go inside

778
01:02:12,563 --> 01:02:14,922
Whose bike is this?

779
01:02:14,923 --> 01:02:17,083
That... belongs to some kid.

780
01:02:23,483 --> 01:02:25,002
Where's the kid?

781
01:02:25,003 --> 01:02:27,522
The kid's not here anymore.

782
01:02:27,523 --> 01:02:28,722
Where did he go?

783
01:02:28,723 --> 01:02:29,522
Huh?

784
01:02:29,523 --> 01:02:31,203
Where'd he go?

785
01:02:31,643 --> 01:02:34,122
Moved to a new house.
Don't you need to pee?

786
01:02:34,123 --> 01:02:34,842
Oh, yes!

787
01:02:34,843 --> 01:02:36,123
Go on then

788
01:02:37,683 --> 01:02:39,843
Not that one, over here

789
01:02:40,843 --> 01:02:41,723
Well...

790
01:02:43,043 --> 01:02:44,042
it's dark!

791
01:02:44,043 --> 01:02:45,363
I'm coming...

792
01:02:48,603 --> 01:02:50,682
It's scary in there

793
01:02:50,683 --> 01:02:52,683
Come on

794
01:02:54,043 --> 01:02:56,563
No, I don't need to go anymore.

795
01:02:57,443 --> 01:02:58,562
Let me help

796
01:02:58,563 --> 01:03:03,483
No, you go... I... I'll do it

797
01:03:04,443 --> 01:03:05,962
Are you feeling shy in front of me?

798
01:03:05,963 --> 01:03:06,843
Nope!

799
01:03:08,243 --> 01:03:09,763
Can you do it yourself?

800
01:03:30,363 --> 01:03:32,723
I'm drawing his mustache

801
01:03:41,643 --> 01:03:42,763
Yes?

802
01:03:43,483 --> 01:03:44,723
Come up, dear.

803
01:03:45,163 --> 01:03:46,483
Who was it?

804
01:03:47,203 --> 01:03:48,482
Uncle Emad

805
01:03:48,483 --> 01:03:52,402
If it's my dad,
then tell him Sadra's not here.

806
01:03:52,403 --> 01:03:53,523
Why?

807
01:03:54,763 --> 01:03:56,962
Because I love my Mom

808
01:03:56,963 --> 01:03:58,043
Okay

809
01:04:11,723 --> 01:04:12,883
Rana?

810
01:04:13,123 --> 01:04:13,722
Hey

811
01:04:13,723 --> 01:04:15,482
The pickup isn't in the parking.

812
01:04:15,483 --> 01:04:17,482
I parked it outside this morning.

813
01:04:17,483 --> 01:04:19,082
Why?

814
01:04:19,083 --> 01:04:22,602
I didn't fancy moving it every ten minutes

815
01:04:22,603 --> 01:04:23,522
Hello!

816
01:04:23,523 --> 01:04:26,402
Helloooo, how are you kid?

817
01:04:26,403 --> 01:04:27,802
Where are the keys?

818
01:04:27,803 --> 01:04:29,323
Where you'd left them.

819
01:04:30,403 --> 01:04:32,122
How are things with my favorite?

820
01:04:32,123 --> 01:04:34,003
Welcome to our house, all good?

821
01:04:34,443 --> 01:04:35,603
Welcome!

822
01:04:39,883 --> 01:04:41,882
Leave it where it is Emad

823
01:04:41,883 --> 01:04:42,682
I'll be right back

824
01:04:42,683 --> 01:04:44,683
Emad... Emad...

825
01:04:46,683 --> 01:04:49,722
Let's forget all that for tonight,
just leave it.

826
01:04:49,723 --> 01:04:52,923
I've made dinner, go wash
your hands and change.

827
01:04:53,363 --> 01:04:54,643
Go on, darling

828
01:05:05,723 --> 01:05:09,043
Ready for takeoff ladies and gentleman!

829
01:05:12,723 --> 01:05:14,443
Sadra!

830
01:05:14,843 --> 01:05:15,922
Yes!

831
01:05:15,923 --> 01:05:17,922
Emad it's ready,
come before it gets cold.

832
01:05:17,923 --> 01:05:19,123
Coming

833
01:05:19,403 --> 01:05:21,122
Let's go wash those hands of yours.

834
01:05:21,123 --> 01:05:22,802
My hands are clean!

835
01:05:22,803 --> 01:05:24,122
Let's wash them again anyways.

836
01:05:24,123 --> 01:05:27,363
Wow, wow, wow, look at this!

837
01:05:28,923 --> 01:05:30,963
Thanks so much

838
01:05:33,483 --> 01:05:34,482
Get your hands off it!

839
01:05:34,483 --> 01:05:38,602
Rana, where are you?

840
01:05:38,603 --> 01:05:41,243
Sadra, come and eat!

841
01:05:41,843 --> 01:05:44,282
Hello

842
01:05:44,283 --> 01:05:48,002
Hello trouble, have you two been
having fun without me?

843
01:05:48,003 --> 01:05:48,363
We went shopping
and then hung out

844
01:05:48,364 --> 01:05:49,882
Well done!
We went shopping and then hung out

845
01:05:49,883 --> 01:05:51,443
We went shopping and then hung out

846
01:05:51,643 --> 01:05:54,082
But we didn't find Spongebob

847
01:05:54,083 --> 01:05:56,082
Yes, unfortunately.

848
01:05:56,083 --> 01:06:00,723
Don't worry, Patrick, eventually a good day
will come when you and I will find someone.

849
01:06:01,323 --> 01:06:04,803
Look at this, Spongebob!

850
01:06:05,323 --> 01:06:08,923
Look what Auntie Rana made, macaroni!

851
01:06:10,843 --> 01:06:11,722
More?

852
01:06:11,723 --> 01:06:13,043
No no, that's enough

853
01:06:13,443 --> 01:06:15,202
Okay, just let me know

854
01:06:15,203 --> 01:06:17,003
Thank you

855
01:06:19,163 --> 01:06:22,282
Wow, what a nice macaroni!

856
01:06:22,283 --> 01:06:23,282
Bon appetit!

857
01:06:23,283 --> 01:06:25,243
Let's eat it all

858
01:06:25,523 --> 01:06:27,042
Look what she's made.

859
01:06:27,043 --> 01:06:28,243
Yeah, I know!

860
01:06:29,643 --> 01:06:31,363
How was tonight's performance?

861
01:06:32,203 --> 01:06:33,603
Very...

862
01:06:34,043 --> 01:06:35,203
not that great.

863
01:06:35,443 --> 01:06:36,802
It was terrible

864
01:06:36,803 --> 01:06:38,122
You're lying

865
01:06:38,123 --> 01:06:40,403
That's how it is without you

866
01:06:42,203 --> 01:06:43,682
Did you find the credit card?

867
01:06:43,683 --> 01:06:45,043
No

868
01:06:47,323 --> 01:06:48,683
How did you go shopping?

869
01:06:49,043 --> 01:06:50,803
With the money you'd left

870
01:06:52,123 --> 01:06:53,682
What money?

871
01:06:53,683 --> 01:06:54,723
In the drawer.

872
01:07:09,323 --> 01:07:11,363
Why aren't you eating?
Do you not like it?

873
01:07:11,803 --> 01:07:14,203
Is it not tasty?

874
01:07:22,923 --> 01:07:24,683
Don't eat it

875
01:07:26,363 --> 01:07:27,523
What's up?

876
01:07:36,443 --> 01:07:39,283
That scumbag had left it behind
the other night.

877
01:08:05,843 --> 01:08:07,203
Sadra?

878
01:08:08,363 --> 01:08:10,203
I've got an idea

879
01:08:10,563 --> 01:08:11,682
Do you like pizza?

880
01:08:11,683 --> 01:08:12,643
Yep

881
01:08:13,403 --> 01:08:14,923
Then let's order some pizza.

882
01:08:15,163 --> 01:08:17,083
Don't eat that, it's not good

883
01:08:19,603 --> 01:08:21,443
Do you like fries?

884
01:08:22,323 --> 01:08:24,123
And after that Ice Cream?

885
01:08:34,024 --> 01:08:35,018
- Hi there. Gimme a call when you can.

886
01:08:35,043 --> 01:08:38,923
Hello? Mum? Mummy?

887
01:08:41,003 --> 01:08:44,803
Hello? Uncle? Are you there?

888
01:08:46,003 --> 01:08:49,763
It's the 3rd time I'm calling.

889
01:08:51,243 --> 01:08:53,083
Hi darling, it's Babak

890
01:08:55,243 --> 01:08:59,603
Hi... hi...

891
01:09:00,683 --> 01:09:02,803
Are you there?

892
01:09:07,283 --> 01:09:12,683
Gimme a call when you get home,
I'll be up late.

893
01:09:15,883 --> 01:09:17,763
What are you doing?

894
01:09:18,803 --> 01:09:20,243
Nothing

895
01:09:20,763 --> 01:09:22,283
Come on, go sleep.

896
01:09:22,603 --> 01:09:24,323
You haven't slept for two nights

897
01:09:24,483 --> 01:09:26,403
I can't sleep.

898
01:09:34,003 --> 01:09:36,402
Why did you open her letters?

899
01:09:36,403 --> 01:09:37,842
It's her private stuff.

900
01:09:37,843 --> 01:09:39,722
I wanna find out
who the hell that scumbag was.

901
01:09:39,723 --> 01:09:41,943
Let's say you find out how it was...

902
01:09:42,483 --> 01:09:43,722
He'll say it was a mistake

903
01:09:43,723 --> 01:09:45,482
He came inside by mistake?

904
01:09:45,483 --> 01:09:47,922
He rang the bell
and I opened the door.

905
01:09:47,923 --> 01:09:51,362
He must've thought it's that woman
since I opened the door so easily.

906
01:09:51,363 --> 01:09:52,523
He came here by mistake?

907
01:09:52,843 --> 01:09:54,962
Any when he realized his mistake...

908
01:09:54,963 --> 01:09:56,682
Why didn't he leave?

909
01:09:56,683 --> 01:09:59,442
Because he saw the bathroom light's on
and there's a woman in there?

910
01:09:59,443 --> 01:10:00,482
How would he know it's a...

911
01:10:00,483 --> 01:10:02,763
From your clothes on the bed.

912
01:10:05,723 --> 01:10:08,522
If I'd just used the damn intercom...

913
01:10:08,523 --> 01:10:11,043
If I'd just asked who it was...

914
01:10:11,803 --> 01:10:13,723
None of this would've happened

915
01:10:13,823 --> 01:10:15,842
If you think it's that simple...

916
01:10:15,843 --> 01:10:19,723
You can just tell all the neighbors
about the intercom...

917
01:10:19,823 --> 01:10:21,442
Why are you getting
the neighbors into this?

918
01:10:21,443 --> 01:10:23,122
They knew what was
going on in this house.

919
01:10:23,123 --> 01:10:25,082
So it'd be fine with you,
if they didn't know?

920
01:10:25,083 --> 01:10:27,083
What are you on about?

921
01:10:28,584 --> 01:10:29,784
Leave me alone.

922
01:10:45,003 --> 01:10:46,802
The pickup wasn't there

923
01:10:46,803 --> 01:10:47,443
What?

924
01:10:49,403 --> 01:10:50,283
Sorry

925
01:10:51,803 --> 01:10:52,963
Where was it?

926
01:10:53,563 --> 01:10:54,442
There

927
01:10:54,443 --> 01:10:55,923
Sorry

928
01:10:59,483 --> 01:11:00,682
Where did you leave it?

929
01:11:00,683 --> 01:11:01,883
I left it there

930
01:11:04,923 --> 01:11:05,603
Where?

931
01:11:05,723 --> 01:11:08,283
Over there, where the Peugeot is

932
01:11:15,243 --> 01:11:16,563
He's taken it

933
01:11:17,923 --> 01:11:19,803
I have to find that asshole

934
01:11:36,723 --> 01:11:38,483
Jackass!

935
01:11:44,283 --> 01:11:46,163
Okay, slow down!

936
01:12:11,923 --> 01:12:13,283
It's freezing in there.

937
01:12:13,443 --> 01:12:14,362
Never mind.

938
01:12:14,363 --> 01:12:16,562
What do you mean, never mind?
You'll get sick.

939
01:12:16,563 --> 01:12:17,682
Let's go to a public bath.

940
01:12:17,683 --> 01:12:20,083
No, I'll be out quick.
Just wait here.

941
01:12:29,563 --> 01:12:31,042
Hasanpoor, come here a sec.

942
01:12:31,043 --> 01:12:32,803
Hello

943
01:12:39,523 --> 01:12:40,842
What can I do for you, Sir?

944
01:12:40,843 --> 01:12:41,722
Hi

945
01:12:41,723 --> 01:12:43,723
How's it going?

946
01:12:44,003 --> 01:12:46,122
Your dad was a traffic cop, right?

947
01:12:46,123 --> 01:12:47,603
He's retired now, why?

948
01:12:48,723 --> 01:12:50,682
A car hit my wife and drove off.

949
01:12:50,683 --> 01:12:51,722
Hope it's nothing serious, Sir!

950
01:12:51,723 --> 01:12:53,723
No, thank God

951
01:12:54,723 --> 01:12:57,842
It was a pickup, if I give you
the number plate...

952
01:12:57,843 --> 01:13:01,802
Can your Dad find the guy's address?
If it's not too much trouble, that is.

953
01:13:01,803 --> 01:13:05,922
Sure, he has contacts in the department. If
you gimme the license plate, he can find out.

954
01:13:05,923 --> 01:13:07,962
But, I think you should report it.

955
01:13:07,963 --> 01:13:11,882
It wasn't anything serious, so
I don't wanna get the police mixed up.

956
01:13:11,883 --> 01:13:14,443
Okay, gimme the registration
and I'll call my Dad.

957
01:13:15,655 --> 01:13:17,355
- Get a pen and a paper, then.
- 'Kay.

958
01:13:23,545 --> 01:13:24,905
Why don't you want to work for me?

959
01:13:25,046 --> 01:13:27,046
Have you lost your mind, Charlie?
I've got a job.

960
01:13:27,847 --> 01:13:30,247
Then what're you walkin'
in here every week for?

961
01:13:35,048 --> 01:13:37,148
Well, if you don't want me to
walk in here...

962
01:13:37,549 --> 01:13:39,000
I'm offering you a job.

963
01:13:39,001 --> 01:13:43,350
I don't want your goddam job!
I've got one already. Get out a my way!

964
01:13:43,451 --> 01:13:45,851
When the hell are you
going to grow up, huh?

965
01:13:46,252 --> 01:13:48,852
Goddam you, Charlie!
You big ignoramus!

966
01:13:48,953 --> 01:13:53,653
Big ignoramus!
How dare you talk to me like that?

967
01:13:53,754 --> 01:13:56,854
If you say that to me again,
I'll rap you one!

968
01:13:59,855 --> 01:14:01,355
I don't care how big you are!

969
01:14:01,856 --> 01:14:04,056
You degenerate!

970
01:14:16,856 --> 01:14:18,556
What's wrong with you tonight?

971
01:14:19,257 --> 01:14:20,057
What did I do?

972
01:14:20,158 --> 01:14:21,658
Why are you adding dialogues?

973
01:14:22,259 --> 01:14:22,959
What did I add?

974
01:14:23,660 --> 01:14:25,860
If you've got a problem with me,
let's sit and talk.

975
01:14:26,061 --> 01:14:28,461
Not on the stage, calling me,
"You degenerate!"

976
01:14:28,462 --> 01:14:30,962
It's neither improvisation, nor acting,
you're insulting me.

977
01:14:31,063 --> 01:14:32,663
What?
Did I hurt your feeling?

978
01:14:32,664 --> 01:14:33,964
Yeah.

979
01:14:34,465 --> 01:14:37,441
And if you do that one more time,
I'll answer you right in front of everyone.

980
01:14:37,466 --> 01:14:39,966
Degenerate is the one who speaks his mind
through swearing.

981
01:14:40,167 --> 01:14:40,967
Didn't know that.

982
01:14:41,868 --> 01:14:43,068
I'm really sorry.

983
01:14:59,068 --> 01:15:00,968
Bakery

984
01:15:09,569 --> 01:15:10,669
Hello, how're you doing?

985
01:15:18,870 --> 01:15:23,970
Speaking Azeri

986
01:15:34,171 --> 01:15:35,571
What can I do for you?

987
01:15:36,672 --> 01:15:37,552
Two baguettes, please.

988
01:15:41,373 --> 01:15:43,373
You want 'em cut?
Thanks a lot.

989
01:15:44,074 --> 01:15:46,474
That pickup is yours?
Why?

990
01:15:46,775 --> 01:15:49,275
There's an officer writing tickets,
from the top of the street.

991
01:15:49,976 --> 01:15:52,076
Majid, come here, go move the car.

992
01:15:52,477 --> 01:15:54,677
Before the officer slaps a ticket on it.

993
01:16:05,078 --> 01:16:06,478
Soheil, bring the keys.

994
01:16:11,079 --> 01:16:11,999
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

995
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:13,980
Later.

996
01:16:14,681 --> 01:16:15,481
Bye.

997
01:16:16,082 --> 01:16:17,482
Here you go, Sir.

998
01:16:17,583 --> 01:16:18,683
Thanks.

999
01:16:59,384 --> 01:17:01,884
Thanks, dude.
I'll take a water.

1000
01:17:03,385 --> 01:17:05,085
Hello, mister, sorry
is that your pickup?

1001
01:17:05,686 --> 01:17:06,486
Yeah.

1002
01:17:06,787 --> 01:17:09,287
I had some load, I wanted to
ask you to move it for me.

1003
01:17:09,488 --> 01:17:10,768
Nah, that pickup is for a store.

1004
01:17:11,189 --> 01:17:12,629
Well, not now, whenever you're free.

1005
01:17:12,890 --> 01:17:15,130
No, it's just that, I do something else.
I don't do that.

1006
01:17:15,291 --> 01:17:16,691
Not even Friday?

1007
01:17:16,792 --> 01:17:19,792
- Nah.
- You can find pickups at the top of Haft-e-Tir.

1008
01:17:20,093 --> 01:17:23,969
No, it's just that, my stuff are books and paintings
and things like that, I was looking for a sof topper.

1009
01:17:23,994 --> 01:17:27,094
You know, on account of rain
or things like that.

1010
01:17:27,495 --> 01:17:28,895
I'm really busy.
I don't have time.

1011
01:17:29,196 --> 01:17:32,296
I don't care about the fee. I'll pay.
I just want my stuff to get there safe.

1012
01:17:32,397 --> 01:17:34,297
It's just that, I'm busy.
I can't.

1013
01:17:34,498 --> 01:17:36,818
Majid, come on, man.
Help the guy. Late night or something.

1014
01:17:37,599 --> 01:17:40,599
Well, how about you gimme your number?
I'll call you whenever you say.

1015
01:17:40,700 --> 01:17:43,000
And if you come yourself,
even better.

1016
01:17:43,101 --> 01:17:45,301
Bro, find some time between
your schedule for him.

1017
01:17:48,102 --> 01:17:50,002
Careful not to hit the walls.

1018
01:17:55,103 --> 01:17:57,503
Ah! what're you doing here?

1019
01:17:58,704 --> 01:18:00,704
Come here... kitty...

1020
01:18:04,705 --> 01:18:06,145
Careful with that not to scratch it.

1021
01:18:07,106 --> 01:18:09,406
Babak, tell 'em to come
have a cup of tea.

1022
01:18:10,007 --> 01:18:11,907
- There's no need for that.
- It's getting cold.

1023
01:18:16,008 --> 01:18:17,808
Where are you taking these?

1024
01:18:17,909 --> 01:18:21,709
I'm taking 'em to my parent's parking lot.
We'll see what happens.

1025
01:18:21,910 --> 01:18:23,110
Won't she come to take 'em?

1026
01:18:23,811 --> 01:18:26,511
She's got problems of her own.
She hasn't found a place yet.

1027
01:18:33,513 --> 01:18:35,913
Get up, Babak wants to
take away that woman's stuff.

1028
01:18:36,714 --> 01:18:37,814
What do you want me to do?

1029
01:18:42,115 --> 01:18:43,715
What's going on between you two?

1030
01:18:44,016 --> 01:18:45,856
Nothing, let him take 'em.
That's okay with me.

1031
01:18:53,417 --> 01:18:55,717
Hello? Majid?

1032
01:18:56,618 --> 01:18:58,418
It's me, Etesami, coupla days ago.

1033
01:18:58,619 --> 01:19:00,319
You free today?

1034
01:19:01,220 --> 01:19:02,220
How about Friday?

1035
01:20:06,720 --> 01:20:07,820
Yeah?

1036
01:20:09,621 --> 01:20:10,321
You?

1037
01:20:12,922 --> 01:20:14,822
Yeah, come on up.

1038
01:20:35,121 --> 01:20:36,521
Hello, can I help you?

1039
01:20:36,922 --> 01:20:39,922
Hello, Sir. You okay?
Have I come to the right place?

1040
01:20:40,223 --> 01:20:42,103
Majid said, there's some stuff
you need to move.

1041
01:20:42,504 --> 01:20:44,624
That's right, come on in.
Why didn't he come himself?

1042
01:20:44,725 --> 01:20:47,625
Well, he was busy,
so he sent me instead.

1043
01:20:49,626 --> 01:20:50,626
- After you.
- You first.

1044
01:20:50,727 --> 01:20:52,727
But he didn't say anything
about all these stairs.

1045
01:20:53,928 --> 01:20:55,228
With this heart of mine.

1046
01:20:55,328 --> 01:20:59,528
Well, if I knew you're coming, I would've told
him about the stairs, and the broken elevator.

1047
01:20:59,829 --> 01:21:03,829
Well, I can't use elevators anyways, Sir.
Would you gimme a glass of water?

1048
01:21:09,030 --> 01:21:10,130
Have you hired movers?

1049
01:21:10,830 --> 01:21:14,930
No, I thought he's coming.
And, we'd take the boxes ourselves.

1050
01:21:15,031 --> 01:21:16,931
Well, the poor guy
was kinda busy today.

1051
01:21:18,232 --> 01:21:20,032
- Is he your son?
- Nah, my son-in-law.

1052
01:21:20,133 --> 01:21:22,333
Doesn't make a difference though.
He's like my own son.

1053
01:21:30,234 --> 01:21:34,334
Sorry, old man, we just moved out.
There's no glasses or anything.

1054
01:21:34,635 --> 01:21:36,515
That's alright, mister.
I'll drink from the tap.

1055
01:21:38,536 --> 01:21:39,736
Where are the boxes?

1056
01:21:40,937 --> 01:21:42,037
In that room.

1057
01:21:42,738 --> 01:21:44,838
We'll see. If there's too many,
we'll call movers.

1058
01:21:47,839 --> 01:21:51,739
Give him a call. Maybe he's around
here somewhere. I can pick him up.

1059
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:53,840
Who?

1060
01:21:54,240 --> 01:21:55,040
Your son-in-law.

1061
01:21:55,741 --> 01:21:59,441
Nah, the poor souls just went shopping
for the "exchange of the vows" ceremony.

1062
01:22:04,342 --> 01:22:06,242
Isn't the janitor
allowed to help here?

1063
01:22:06,843 --> 01:22:08,443
Nah, the building's empty.

1064
01:22:08,544 --> 01:22:10,844
The walls caved,
the residents have all moved out.

1065
01:22:10,945 --> 01:22:13,545
Wow, wow! what if it collapses
on us or something?

1066
01:22:13,846 --> 01:22:14,646
Nah.

1067
01:22:14,847 --> 01:22:17,747
Let's take a look and see
if it's worth hiring movers.

1068
01:22:18,848 --> 01:22:19,648
Grandpa!

1069
01:22:20,549 --> 01:22:21,249
What?

1070
01:22:21,550 --> 01:22:24,650
Would you come sit here for a sec?
I wanna tell you something.

1071
01:22:24,751 --> 01:22:26,651
Look here, mister,
this isn't my line of work.

1072
01:22:26,652 --> 01:22:28,852
Majid, said, "there's this guy,
who's called a coupla times..."

1073
01:22:28,853 --> 01:22:31,753
would you do it?"
I said, okay, why not?

1074
01:22:31,754 --> 01:22:33,654
Now, you paying depends on
how generous you're feeling.

1075
01:22:33,655 --> 01:22:37,655
Nah, it's not about... wages,
fees, and stuff like that.

1076
01:22:38,256 --> 01:22:41,056
Just sit down. There's something
I have to tell you.

1077
01:22:44,057 --> 01:22:45,957
Good news, I hope.

1078
01:22:49,558 --> 01:22:51,158
How long do you know this guy?

1079
01:22:51,859 --> 01:22:53,559
- My son-in-law?
- Yeah.

1080
01:22:53,860 --> 01:22:54,560
What for?

1081
01:22:54,861 --> 01:22:56,181
I wanna know
if you know him well.

1082
01:22:56,962 --> 01:22:59,482
Well, it's about two years they've
asked for my daughter's hand.

1083
01:23:00,263 --> 01:23:01,963
Have you asked around about him?

1084
01:23:04,664 --> 01:23:06,064
Do you know Majid?

1085
01:23:07,665 --> 01:23:09,565
If there's anything you know,
just tell me.

1086
01:23:10,766 --> 01:23:14,666
When my wife and I moved out of here,
we went to a place that...

1087
01:23:15,867 --> 01:23:21,667
it's previous tenant was... you know,
a woman of the street.

1088
01:23:23,368 --> 01:23:27,668
One night, when I got home a little late.
My wife was alone in the house.

1089
01:23:28,669 --> 01:23:31,969
One of these lowlifes on account of
that woman still being there...

1090
01:23:33,170 --> 01:23:33,930
enters my house.

1091
01:23:36,671 --> 01:23:38,571
When my wife was
in the bathroom.

1092
01:23:38,872 --> 01:23:40,272
The jerk goes into the bathroom.

1093
01:23:40,773 --> 01:23:41,573
Who?

1094
01:23:42,074 --> 01:23:43,574
That filthy
son-in-law of yours.

1095
01:23:47,675 --> 01:23:49,675
Now, how do you know
it was Majid?

1096
01:23:49,876 --> 01:23:53,776
When my wife starts screaming,
the guys makes a run for it, but...

1097
01:23:54,677 --> 01:23:56,917
He was in such a hurry that,
he leaves his pickup behind.

1098
01:23:57,278 --> 01:23:59,778
I found him from his pickup.
I went down to where he works.

1099
01:24:01,079 --> 01:24:04,079
I wanted to go there,
grab hold of him...

1100
01:24:06,380 --> 01:24:08,661
and dishonor him in front of
all his co-workers, but...

1101
01:24:11,581 --> 01:24:12,757
I couldn't bring myself to do it.

1102
01:24:12,782 --> 01:24:15,682
This pickup changes hands
a lot in that store.

1103
01:24:15,683 --> 01:24:17,783
That's why I asked him to come here.
To talk to him, and ask him...

1104
01:24:17,784 --> 01:24:20,584
if it was him or someone else.

1105
01:24:20,585 --> 01:24:21,785
Majid's not like that...

1106
01:24:23,786 --> 01:24:26,886
if I find out it's been him,
I'll call off everything.

1107
01:24:26,987 --> 01:24:27,887
The wedding and all.

1108
01:24:32,828 --> 01:24:34,588
How's your wife, now?

1109
01:24:36,989 --> 01:24:38,489
I don't know what to say.

1110
01:24:42,090 --> 01:24:43,790
Let me talk to him tonight.

1111
01:24:43,891 --> 01:24:46,091
Give him a call and tell him
I wanna talk to him.

1112
01:24:46,192 --> 01:24:48,592
Tell him to come here,
I wanna ask him who's done it.

1113
01:24:48,593 --> 01:24:53,093
Well, it's just, they've gone with my wife and
daughter for "the exchange of vows" shopping.

1114
01:24:54,594 --> 01:24:55,894
Well, at least give him a call.

1115
01:24:56,895 --> 01:24:58,995
Ask him who had his pickup
that night.

1116
01:25:00,595 --> 01:25:01,895
When did this happen?

1117
01:25:01,996 --> 01:25:04,596
About two weeks ago.

1118
01:25:06,897 --> 01:25:11,497
Okay, so you just let me
talk to him tonight... Oh my...

1119
01:25:13,698 --> 01:25:15,698
But, I wanna talk to him,
old man.

1120
01:25:15,899 --> 01:25:20,499
Wait a second, I wanna talk to him.
Call him.

1121
01:25:20,700 --> 01:25:22,900
I don't have his number
in my phone.

1122
01:25:23,301 --> 01:25:24,401
I have it.

1123
01:25:26,502 --> 01:25:29,602
When I say call him to come here,
it's because I don't want to...

1124
01:25:29,603 --> 01:25:31,703
go down to the store, make a scene
in front of his co-workers.

1125
01:25:31,704 --> 01:25:33,804
You just let me
make sure it's him.

1126
01:25:34,705 --> 01:25:37,705
I have to talk to him in such a way
that I'll get an answer...

1127
01:25:37,706 --> 01:25:39,026
How about I call him myself, huh?

1128
01:25:39,807 --> 01:25:41,607
You want me to do it?

1129
01:25:43,708 --> 01:25:45,108
Okay, let me just
dial his number.

1130
01:25:58,609 --> 01:26:01,809
Hello, Majid? Hi, son...
where are you guys?

1131
01:26:03,110 --> 01:26:05,810
Yeah, I'm here with him.

1132
01:26:08,611 --> 01:26:09,611
Who's with you?

1133
01:26:11,912 --> 01:26:15,812
Listen, when you're alone, gimme a call.
I wanna tell you something.

1134
01:26:18,313 --> 01:26:19,613
Call my cell.

1135
01:26:21,014 --> 01:26:23,714
I don't have it memorized.
Ask Moj'gan.

1136
01:26:25,915 --> 01:26:30,015
Okay... it's nothing...
Bye.

1137
01:26:34,516 --> 01:26:35,892
He said, he'll call when he's alone.

1138
01:26:35,917 --> 01:26:37,817
Say, what do you do yourself?

1139
01:26:39,318 --> 01:26:41,918
I work with this car of Majid's.
His pickup.

1140
01:26:42,419 --> 01:26:45,119
I sell clothes from the
back of the pickup, at nights.

1141
01:26:45,220 --> 01:26:48,120
And I don't come out during the day,
on account of my heart.

1142
01:26:51,121 --> 01:26:54,221
And, how come you don't have
your son-in-law's number?

1143
01:26:54,722 --> 01:26:57,422
Well, I just don't.
Not just him, a lot of people.

1144
01:26:58,323 --> 01:27:00,023
Have you just bought
this number of yours?

1145
01:27:00,324 --> 01:27:01,124
No.

1146
01:27:18,725 --> 01:27:21,625
How come... your son-in-law
doesn't have your number?

1147
01:27:22,926 --> 01:27:25,326
You just told him to
get it from someone else, huh?

1148
01:27:25,827 --> 01:27:27,727
I don't know, man, I don't know.

1149
01:27:28,628 --> 01:27:31,328
I'm so messed up right now that,
I don't even remember my own name.

1150
01:27:34,729 --> 01:27:35,929
Wait a second, old man.

1151
01:27:36,030 --> 01:27:37,830
- It won't open.
- Not so fast. Wait a minute.

1152
01:27:39,832 --> 01:27:41,832
If it's okay, I want you
to take off your shoes.

1153
01:27:42,633 --> 01:27:43,633
What for?

1154
01:27:43,834 --> 01:27:45,434
I wanna see your foot.

1155
01:27:46,635 --> 01:27:48,911
Mister, I'm as old as your father,
you're telling me to take off my shoes?

1156
01:27:48,936 --> 01:27:50,536
Open the door, let me go!

1157
01:27:50,837 --> 01:27:52,813
I didn't do anything to you.
Why are you talking like that?

1158
01:27:52,838 --> 01:27:54,538
Take it easy.

1159
01:27:54,739 --> 01:27:57,815
Just take off your shoes for a sec.
Then, I'll open the door for you to leave.

1160
01:27:57,840 --> 01:28:01,140
Why should I take off my shoes?
Open the door!

1161
01:28:01,141 --> 01:28:04,141
Hush! Come here.
Let's go over there.

1162
01:28:14,042 --> 01:28:16,142
Sit on the stair, for a sec,
take off your shoes.

1163
01:28:17,643 --> 01:28:18,143
Sit!

1164
01:28:20,644 --> 01:28:21,244
Sit down!

1165
01:28:24,045 --> 01:28:25,545
Just sit, okay?

1166
01:28:31,246 --> 01:28:32,746
Take off your shoes, please.

1167
01:28:33,047 --> 01:28:34,323
I'm not feeling well, just don't!

1168
01:28:34,348 --> 01:28:35,648
Well, let me help you.

1169
01:28:35,849 --> 01:28:36,849
I'll take it off, okay.

1170
01:28:38,750 --> 01:28:40,450
Whispering: I'll take it off.

1171
01:28:47,851 --> 01:28:49,651
The other one,
take off the other one too.

1172
01:28:57,652 --> 01:28:58,652
Your socks too.

1173
01:29:00,553 --> 01:29:02,253
Mister, what do you want from me?

1174
01:29:02,354 --> 01:29:04,254
Take 'em off!
I said, take off your socks.

1175
01:29:04,354 --> 01:29:05,454
Let me do it myself.

1176
01:29:05,655 --> 01:29:07,855
- No!
- Let me! just let me!

1177
01:30:22,756 --> 01:30:23,756
Hello, Siavash!

1178
01:30:26,757 --> 01:30:28,657
No, I'm a little busy right now.

1179
01:30:30,158 --> 01:30:32,058
What time is it, anyways?

1180
01:30:32,859 --> 01:30:34,559
No I'll be there.
Don't worry.

1181
01:30:37,260 --> 01:30:40,560
She'll come herself...
She's a little busy.

1182
01:30:41,147 --> 01:30:42,747
Yeah, I'm okay. I'm fine.

1183
01:30:43,648 --> 01:30:44,748
Okay, bye.

1184
01:30:47,049 --> 01:30:49,749
Swear on my life, I didn't
want to harass anyone.

1185
01:30:51,750 --> 01:30:54,150
Did that woman tell
you to go there that night?

1186
01:30:54,751 --> 01:30:57,351
That woman had been messaging me
for at least a month.

1187
01:30:57,652 --> 01:31:01,432
She said, "If you still have the pickup,
come over, I wanna see you."

1188
01:31:02,553 --> 01:31:05,453
And I messaged back,
"Hi, dear, sorry..."

1189
01:31:05,554 --> 01:31:07,654
I'm not feeling well.
I can't come.

1190
01:31:08,755 --> 01:31:11,655
She took it to herself.
No matter how many times I called...

1191
01:31:11,756 --> 01:31:13,956
She never answered.

1192
01:31:14,857 --> 01:31:16,057
Didn't want to talk to me.

1193
01:31:16,758 --> 01:31:19,128
That night, I thought I'd drop by
and make it up to her.

1194
01:31:19,459 --> 01:31:20,859
Didn't you know she's moved out?

1195
01:31:21,160 --> 01:31:22,860
God knows, I had no idea.
Swear on my kids' life...

1196
01:31:22,861 --> 01:31:26,861
You opened the door, and went in.
You saw the furniture is different...

1197
01:31:26,862 --> 01:31:28,382
How come you're saying
you didn't know?

1198
01:31:28,463 --> 01:31:32,863
I went in, I saw a bunch of stuff,
the bicycle I had bought myself...

1199
01:31:34,864 --> 01:31:36,764
I thought maybe she's moving.

1200
01:31:36,765 --> 01:31:38,841
You're not going out of that door,
until you tell the truth.

1201
01:31:38,866 --> 01:31:42,206
If I had the slightest idea that
you guys have moved in,

1202
01:31:42,267 --> 01:31:45,267
I would've thought, maybe
there's a man in the bathroom.

1203
01:31:45,768 --> 01:31:47,944
- My wife's clothes were on the bed.
- I didn't saw those.

1204
01:31:47,969 --> 01:31:49,969
You saw those and figured
there must be a woman in the bath.

1205
01:31:49,970 --> 01:31:52,470
All alone, she even
opened the door for you.

1206
01:31:52,471 --> 01:31:53,971
I didn't see any clothes.

1207
01:31:54,372 --> 01:31:57,772
It didn't take even five minutes.
I came in, there was no one there.

1208
01:31:57,773 --> 01:32:00,673
Just a minute ago, your wife
had opened the door for me.

1209
01:32:01,074 --> 01:32:02,974
Why did your wife
open the door for me?

1210
01:32:02,975 --> 01:32:04,675
Well, she thought it's me.

1211
01:32:04,775 --> 01:32:06,775
Let me tell you
what really happened.

1212
01:32:06,876 --> 01:32:11,376
I went by the bathroom door,
called the kid, as soon as I did...

1213
01:32:11,477 --> 01:32:13,277
there starts the screaming.
Then, I ran away.

1214
01:32:13,278 --> 01:32:14,678
You went into the bathroom.

1215
01:32:14,779 --> 01:32:16,379
I didn't go in the bathroom.

1216
01:32:16,480 --> 01:32:18,080
Then, where was your foot cut like that?

1217
01:32:18,081 --> 01:32:21,681
I have no idea.
By the time I was downstairs...

1218
01:32:21,702 --> 01:32:23,872
I felt a sting in my foot. I thought I've
stepped on something running down stairs.

1219
01:32:23,873 --> 01:32:25,073
Then, my wife's lying?

1220
01:32:25,074 --> 01:32:26,774
Your wife says I went into the bathroom?

1221
01:32:26,775 --> 01:32:31,675
My wife was scared and bumped into the glass, otherwise
God knows what you would've done, dirty scumbag!

1222
01:32:31,676 --> 01:32:34,776
I swear on my life or
whatever's dear to you...

1223
01:32:34,777 --> 01:32:37,176
as soon as I found out I'm
in the wrong place, I ran away.

1224
01:32:37,177 --> 01:32:41,577
Well, just tell your wife to come here.
Here, I'll wait right here. Ask her.

1225
01:32:41,598 --> 01:32:43,678
What's my wife supposed to say?

1226
01:32:44,779 --> 01:32:47,779
My wife's said all she had to say.
It's your wife's turn to come here.

1227
01:32:48,380 --> 01:32:50,380
Call her, and tell her to
come here, right now.

1228
01:32:51,381 --> 01:32:52,081
What for?

1229
01:32:52,182 --> 01:32:54,358
What you said, I want you to repeat
in front of your wife.

1230
01:32:54,383 --> 01:32:56,683
Mister, why don't you get it?
I didn't go in that bath...

1231
01:32:56,684 --> 01:32:57,984
Okay, you didn't!

1232
01:32:58,485 --> 01:33:01,485
I want you to tell your wife
what you were doing in that house.

1233
01:33:01,586 --> 01:33:02,586
Call her, right now!

1234
01:33:03,087 --> 01:33:04,487
Get it out, and call her!

1235
01:33:04,988 --> 01:33:06,588
Nope! Get out your cell!

1236
01:33:11,588 --> 01:33:13,688
Don't make me look bad
in front of my wife and kids.

1237
01:33:14,089 --> 01:33:15,089
Call her, right now.

1238
01:33:15,290 --> 01:33:17,190
My daughter's about to get married.

1239
01:33:17,191 --> 01:33:18,831
Your daughter has to know
her real father.

1240
01:33:19,192 --> 01:33:24,192
I'm gonna tell your son-in-law everything,
just so he knows his father-in-law.

1241
01:33:24,593 --> 01:33:27,293
I don't have have to keep you here.
Go on, get out! Go!

1242
01:33:28,394 --> 01:33:31,994
I'm gonna call your son-in-law,
tell him to bring your wife here...

1243
01:33:31,995 --> 01:33:33,795
Leave me alone, mister! Ah!

1244
01:33:40,496 --> 01:33:42,396
Someone help me!
Help!

1245
01:33:43,097 --> 01:33:45,497
Don't make noises!
Quiet!

1246
01:33:46,998 --> 01:33:48,598
Open the door! Open up!
I'll die!

1247
01:33:50,399 --> 01:33:53,799
I'm about to have a stroke.
Open the door!

1248
01:33:54,900 --> 01:33:59,200
Mister! open the door!
I'm afraid of closed spaces.

1249
01:34:03,101 --> 01:34:04,101
Open the door, my boy.

1250
01:34:11,802 --> 01:34:13,702
At least turn on the lights.

1251
01:34:39,003 --> 01:34:40,303
Forgive me...

1252
01:34:42,404 --> 01:34:44,004
my dear!

1253
01:34:47,104 --> 01:34:48,804
I can't cry.

1254
01:34:50,905 --> 01:34:53,105
Why did you ever do that to yourself?

1255
01:34:57,106 --> 01:34:59,106
I don't understand it.

1256
01:34:59,807 --> 01:35:02,007
Help me, Willy!

1257
01:35:07,408 --> 01:35:09,708
It seems to me that you're
just on another trip.

1258
01:35:10,809 --> 01:35:12,309
I keep expecting you.

1259
01:35:19,111 --> 01:35:21,111
I made the last payment
on the house today.

1260
01:35:22,911 --> 01:35:24,111
Right today.

1261
01:35:26,112 --> 01:35:28,512
And there'll be nobody home.

1262
01:35:31,413 --> 01:35:33,713
We're free and clear.

1263
01:35:37,414 --> 01:35:39,014
We're free.

1264
01:36:57,915 --> 01:36:59,515
Rana, lock the door,
and take the keys.

1265
01:37:12,216 --> 01:37:14,016
Get up, on your feet.

1266
01:37:29,817 --> 01:37:31,017
Here, wait.

1267
01:37:32,818 --> 01:37:33,818
Sit here.

1268
01:37:50,019 --> 01:37:51,319
You go in that room.

1269
01:38:20,820 --> 01:38:23,020
Look how mentally and
emotionally shattered she is.

1270
01:38:31,621 --> 01:38:35,721
There's my wife. Are you gonna keep saying
you haven't gone into the bathroom?

1271
01:38:37,722 --> 01:38:38,522
I'm sorry.

1272
01:38:39,323 --> 01:38:40,423
Answer me.

1273
01:38:43,624 --> 01:38:44,724
I made a mistake.

1274
01:38:45,425 --> 01:38:48,325
Tell me, why did you
go into the bathroom?

1275
01:38:53,926 --> 01:38:55,426
I gave into temptation.

1276
01:39:07,128 --> 01:39:08,428
What are you gonna do to him?

1277
01:39:08,829 --> 01:39:12,929
His family are on their way,
I want his wife to know what he's done.

1278
01:39:21,323 --> 01:39:23,123
You're taking your revenge.

1279
01:39:26,124 --> 01:39:27,524
Let him go, let him leave.

1280
01:39:28,425 --> 01:39:29,925
I know what I'm doing.

1281
01:39:31,526 --> 01:39:33,526
You sit here, there's no need
for you to come out.

1282
01:39:55,927 --> 01:39:57,427
Where are you going?

1283
01:39:59,328 --> 01:40:01,728
I'm not feeling right at all.
Let me go.

1284
01:40:02,729 --> 01:40:03,729
They're coming after you.

1285
01:40:04,230 --> 01:40:06,030
Your son-in-law called,
he asked about you.

1286
01:40:06,131 --> 01:40:07,631
I told him to come over.

1287
01:40:07,832 --> 01:40:09,232
And to bring your wife too.

1288
01:40:11,633 --> 01:40:13,633
They're on their way.
Sit down.

1289
01:40:19,734 --> 01:40:21,334
I'm begging you, please
let me go.

1290
01:40:22,235 --> 01:40:24,595
When your family get here.
Tell them everything you told me.

1291
01:40:25,636 --> 01:40:26,212
Then you can leave.

1292
01:40:26,237 --> 01:40:27,237
I'm begging you.

1293
01:40:46,038 --> 01:40:47,038
Miss!

1294
01:40:47,939 --> 01:40:48,939
Forgive me.

1295
01:40:49,740 --> 01:40:51,640
Let me go, before they get here.

1296
01:41:10,140 --> 01:41:12,740
That woman lived with me for
35 years.

1297
01:41:25,941 --> 01:41:27,641
Mister! get up!
Get up, go!

1298
01:41:31,642 --> 01:41:33,242
You, sit down!

1299
01:41:33,542 --> 01:41:34,662
Leave him alone, let him go.

1300
01:41:35,043 --> 01:41:38,743
He'll go, he will. When his family
get here, they can leave together.

1301
01:41:39,944 --> 01:41:40,844
Sit down.

1302
01:41:41,045 --> 01:41:41,821
For the love of God!

1303
01:41:41,846 --> 01:41:42,746
Here, mister, go.

1304
01:41:42,847 --> 01:41:43,647
- Just, sit down.
- Let him go!

1305
01:41:43,648 --> 01:41:45,048
My girl! My boy!

1306
01:41:45,249 --> 01:41:47,649
- Leave him alone, Emad!
- You stay out of this!

1307
01:41:48,950 --> 01:41:51,250
- Sit down!
- Please.

1308
01:41:51,252 --> 01:41:51,752
I said sit down! Ah!

1309
01:41:51,753 --> 01:41:54,053
SIT... DOWN!
Here.

1310
01:42:13,554 --> 01:42:16,554
What? What do you want?

1311
01:42:27,655 --> 01:42:28,755
Oh, my God!

1312
01:42:32,556 --> 01:42:33,556
Emad!

1313
01:42:33,957 --> 01:42:36,757
- Does he, by any chance,
take any under-the-tongue pills?

1314
01:42:37,358 --> 01:42:39,458
I searched. There's nothing
in his pockets.

1315
01:42:39,460 --> 01:42:41,260
- What happened?
- Where are you now?

1316
01:42:41,961 --> 01:42:45,561
No, no, get here as soon as you can.
Okay, okay.

1317
01:42:46,262 --> 01:42:48,362
- Was it the Emergency?
- His family. They're coming.

1318
01:42:48,564 --> 01:42:51,764
- Oh, my God!
- Mister! can you hear me?

1319
01:42:51,965 --> 01:42:54,765
Does he have a pulse?
Emad, can you hear his heartbeat?

1320
01:42:54,766 --> 01:42:57,366
Rana, for God's sake, keep quiet.
Let me see what I'm doing.

1321
01:43:00,467 --> 01:43:03,387
- Where are you going?
- He said he's got pills. Maybe they're in the car.

1322
01:43:34,668 --> 01:43:38,368
Can you hear me?
Open your mouth. Open!

1323
01:43:53,969 --> 01:43:56,869
Mister! get up!
Can you hear me?

1324
01:44:00,170 --> 01:44:02,670
Oh, God!
Oh, God!

1325
01:44:04,371 --> 01:44:06,671
You better now?
You feeling better?

1326
01:44:09,572 --> 01:44:13,272
Breathe! Breathe!
You better, now?

1327
01:44:27,373 --> 01:44:28,373
Don't worry, he's better.

1328
01:44:28,374 --> 01:44:30,074
You didn't call the Emergency?

1329
01:44:32,864 --> 01:44:34,764
No, I was afraid he might be dead.

1330
01:44:42,325 --> 01:44:43,365
Wait a minute!

1331
01:44:46,666 --> 01:44:50,266
If you say anything to his family,
I don't wanna have anything to do with you.

1332
01:44:59,367 --> 01:45:00,767
Yes?

1333
01:45:05,368 --> 01:45:07,568
- Hello.
- The elevator's broken, use the stairs.

1334
01:45:07,669 --> 01:45:09,369
Come on, ma!

1335
01:45:10,570 --> 01:45:13,770
You go ahead,
I can't run with this pain in my legs.

1336
01:45:18,771 --> 01:45:20,671
Ya Ali!
My dear.

1337
01:45:22,372 --> 01:45:23,472
Come on in.
Come in.

1338
01:45:32,873 --> 01:45:36,373
Ya Allah! Dad!
Dad!

1339
01:45:37,174 --> 01:45:38,574
How are you dad?

1340
01:45:38,875 --> 01:45:40,575
- Majid!
- What? Come in.

1341
01:45:40,677 --> 01:45:44,377
- Dad! Daddy!
- Thank God, he's fine.

1342
01:45:44,378 --> 01:45:45,578
You okay, dad?

1343
01:45:46,078 --> 01:45:47,078
I'm fine.

1344
01:45:47,879 --> 01:45:50,679
You're okay.
That was such a scare, dad.

1345
01:45:51,280 --> 01:45:52,680
Where's you mother?

1346
01:45:52,681 --> 01:45:54,381
She's in the stairs.
Let me call her.

1347
01:45:54,382 --> 01:45:55,682
Majid, don't call her.

1348
01:45:55,883 --> 01:45:57,763
- Let's go!
- We'll go, dad, just wait a little.

1349
01:45:58,484 --> 01:46:02,564
Majid! if mother doesn't see him, she'd think something
must've happened to him. Let her see he's fine.

1350
01:46:02,885 --> 01:46:05,585
Hello, sorry. We were in such a hurry
that we didn't notice you.

1351
01:46:06,686 --> 01:46:09,386
- That's alright.
- Sit down, dad. What are you getting up for?

1352
01:46:09,488 --> 01:46:12,288
I thought mother better come up and
see you, and then we'll leave. Sit.

1353
01:46:12,889 --> 01:46:16,389
We're in no hurry.
Let him sit down until he gets better.

1354
01:46:16,690 --> 01:46:18,390
We're really sorry, mister.

1355
01:46:18,891 --> 01:46:22,791
Dad, just sit down.
Can you?

1356
01:46:22,892 --> 01:46:24,192
Yeah, I'm alright.

1357
01:46:24,393 --> 01:46:25,293
Majid!

1358
01:46:26,894 --> 01:46:29,594
What is it, ma?
We're here.

1359
01:46:29,795 --> 01:46:33,195
Come. Thank God, dad's sitting here.
He's all right.

1360
01:46:33,896 --> 01:46:37,696
What is, dad? Huh?

1361
01:46:53,597 --> 01:46:56,397
- It's nothing, ma.
- What happened?

1362
01:46:58,698 --> 01:46:59,798
What happened to you?

1363
01:47:06,499 --> 01:47:08,899
Sweetheart, didn't I tell you not to go?

1364
01:47:14,700 --> 01:47:16,700
See what you're doing to me and yourself?

1365
01:47:18,601 --> 01:47:21,701
Oh, God.
Thank you so much, God!

1366
01:47:23,902 --> 01:47:26,502
God knows, on our way here
I vowed to give away a hundred

1367
01:47:26,503 --> 01:47:29,103
different charities, just to
hear his voice one more time.

1368
01:47:30,604 --> 01:47:31,604
Thank God.

1369
01:47:36,005 --> 01:47:37,605
How many times did
I tell you not to go?

1370
01:47:37,706 --> 01:47:41,706
My dear! I don't want you to work.
I don't.

1371
01:47:42,907 --> 01:47:45,547
Darling, you said, "Majid called,
I have to go, I'll be back soon."

1372
01:47:45,608 --> 01:47:47,408
Soon, you call this "soon"?

1373
01:47:47,609 --> 01:47:49,609
Mom, we have to thank these guys,
they stayed with him all this time.

1374
01:47:49,610 --> 01:47:52,410
Or else, we don't know
what would've happened to dad.

1375
01:47:51,427 --> 01:47:52,927
It's nothing fancy, you know.

1376
01:47:52,411 --> 01:47:54,411
We really don't know how to thank you.
That was so kind of you.

1377
01:47:54,412 --> 01:47:58,412
May God give you back, miss.

1378
01:47:58,413 --> 01:48:02,013
He's my whole life, mister.
Thank you so much.

1379
01:48:02,814 --> 01:48:04,114
You gave me my life back.

1380
01:48:04,415 --> 01:48:07,215
He's all I've got.

1381
01:48:07,916 --> 01:48:09,716
Come on, mom, stop it.

1382
01:48:12,117 --> 01:48:13,717
Get up, let's go.

1383
01:48:23,419 --> 01:48:25,659
Did you take all your stuff, dad?
Where's your cellphone?

1384
01:48:26,620 --> 01:48:27,620
Car keys.

1385
01:48:29,620 --> 01:48:32,920
Where's his glasses?
Don't leave without his glasses.

1386
01:48:32,921 --> 01:48:40,921
I've got it...
Come here, I'll give it to you.

1387
01:48:34,422 --> 01:48:36,182
- You go, I'll get it
- Majid, the glasses...

1388
01:48:41,824 --> 01:48:42,924
This way.

1389
01:48:43,625 --> 01:48:47,325
What business?
You just saved his life, son.

1390
01:48:48,926 --> 01:48:51,166
No, mister, we've put you through
enough trouble already.

1391
01:48:54,827 --> 01:48:55,927
Come on, this way.

1392
01:48:57,128 --> 01:48:59,028
Well, if there's anything to do,
just let me...

1393
01:48:59,529 --> 01:49:01,929
No, let him come himself.
Come on, this way.

1394
01:49:10,930 --> 01:49:12,130
You guys go.

1395
01:49:23,631 --> 01:49:24,271
Majid. let me...

1396
01:50:09,332 --> 01:50:11,412
How much money did you
leave in the room, that night?

1397
01:50:11,633 --> 01:50:13,433
Huh?

1398
01:50:14,034 --> 01:50:15,634
How much money did you
leave in the room?

1399
01:50:16,635 --> 01:50:17,335
I didn't count.

1400
01:51:34,336 --> 01:51:35,736
What happened, dad?

1401
01:51:36,637 --> 01:51:38,637
What happened to you?
Oh, my God!

1402
01:51:40,338 --> 01:51:42,638
What happened to you?
He's sick again.

1403
01:51:42,939 --> 01:51:45,939
What are these?
Where were these?

1404
01:51:46,340 --> 01:51:48,460
- Come on, sit down a little.
- Is it your heart, dad?

1405
01:51:50,441 --> 01:51:53,941
Let him sit for a while.
Come on, this way.

1406
01:51:55,942 --> 01:51:58,342
We can't take him like this. Majid!

1407
01:51:58,542 --> 01:51:59,642
Majid, hurry up!

1408
01:52:11,443 --> 01:52:13,643
- We're almost there, dad.
- Esmat!

1409
01:52:13,944 --> 01:52:15,444
I'm hear, dear.

1410
01:52:17,645 --> 01:52:18,645
Come on, mom.

1411
01:52:19,146 --> 01:52:20,846
Watch it, don't drop him.

1412
01:52:23,647 --> 01:52:26,647
- Esmat! Esmat!
- What? Darling, I'm here.

1413
01:52:27,649 --> 01:52:29,649
What happened to you?
Ya Abalfazl!

1414
01:52:31,050 --> 01:52:32,050
Stretch his legs.

1415
01:52:38,652 --> 01:52:40,692
- God! Dad! you hear me? Dad!
- Where are his pills?

1416
01:52:42,653 --> 01:52:45,353
Where are his pills?
Search his pockets.

1417
01:52:46,254 --> 01:52:48,454
Stretch his legs! Hurry up!

1418
01:52:51,053 --> 01:52:53,053
- God help us!
- Dad, breathe!

1419
01:52:54,354 --> 01:52:55,634
- See if his pills are upstairs.

1420
01:53:05,255 --> 01:53:08,655
Miss! Miss! are my dad's pills here?

1421
01:53:09,456 --> 01:53:11,356
He's got sick again, he's
lying in the stairs.

1422
01:53:22,358 --> 01:53:24,858
Mister, for God's sake, will you
get on the way right away?

1423
01:53:25,859 --> 01:53:28,379
- Yes, miss, just give some time for
my colleagues to get there.

1424
01:53:29,659 --> 01:53:32,219
Just follow my instructions.
His legs must be straight, not bent.

1425
01:53:37,660 --> 01:53:38,660
He's lying face up.

1426
01:53:47,061 --> 01:53:48,661
Mister, he's all blue in the face.

1427
01:53:49,662 --> 01:53:53,662
Just keep doing what I told you.
If you get tired, let someone else do it.

1428
01:53:58,863 --> 01:54:02,663
Mister, he's not moving...
No, no, nothing. He's not moving at all.

1429
01:54:07,665 --> 01:54:10,365
Mister, can we put his pill
under his tongue?

1430
01:54:10,466 --> 01:54:14,066
- No, no, miss, don't give him anything,
just do what I told you.

1431
01:54:14,667 --> 01:54:17,227
- Just make sure his legs, are stretched, not bent.
- Yeah, yeah.

1432
01:54:57,268 --> 01:54:58,668
Guys, please hurry up!

1433
01:55:02,869 --> 01:55:04,969
- Hello, where's the patient?
- He's inside.
