1
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,040
The Goddess of Prosperity ...

2
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,290
is the symbol of
unlimited gold and food

3
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:39,120
And this earth is her womb

4
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:42,080
When the universe was created...

5
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:46,410
she gave birth
to 160 million Gods

6
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,580
But the Goddess loved
her first child above all ...

7
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:52,960
Hastar

8
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:58,750
But today, you won't find his
name in any ancient scriptures

9
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:00,160
Why, father?

10
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:04,210
Because he wanted all of
the Goddess' gold and food

11
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:08,750
He managed getting the gold ...

12
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:11,000
but just as he went
for the food ...

13
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,750
all the other
Gods attacked him

14
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:18,000
With every blow, Hastar
shattered into fragments

15
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,210
But before he could
dissolve into stardust,

16
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,580
The Goddess saved him

17
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,710
But on one condition

18
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:33,250
That he will never be worshiped
and be forgotten for ever

19
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:39,080
For aeons, Hastar
slept in his mother's womb

20
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,960
But one day, our
ancestors invoked him

21
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,910
And built a shrine in his name

22
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,830
They say, since that day,
all the Gods' wrath ...

23
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,120
has been raining on Tumbbad

24
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:54,410
Why did we even wake him up?

25
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:58,960
Because Hastar's curse
is a boon for us

26
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,910
What do you mean?

27
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:02,710
You'll know ...

28
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:04,960
when you go inside

29
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:06,790
Inside where?

30
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,160
In the Goddess' womb

31
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,330
Please, hurry up

32
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,290
It's about to get dark

33
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:37,540
It'll take the time it takes

34
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:41,580
I am terrified of not feeding
that old hag on time

35
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:43,210
What if she wakes up?

36
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:45,120
Don't say such things
at this dark hour

37
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,660
She won't wake up

38
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,580
If you want to leave in time,
then come early

39
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:03,040
You'd promised me that
gold coin, after this new moon

40
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:08,960
The coin is not a joke!
One has to earn it

41
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:40,870
-Where's mother?
-Wait here

42
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:43,910
Where is she?

43
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:48,080
Where else, must be
at Sarkar's mansion

44
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:05,000
Who will feed the old woman?

45
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:07,790
Mother will, once she returns

46
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,580
-What if she's late?
-Shut up!

47
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,040
What if the old woman
wakes up?

48
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,000
She eats while
she's asleep?

49
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:21,580
You put it in her mouth,
bit by bit, she swallows

50
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:24,910
Does she ever wake up?

51
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:26,580
No

52
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:29,660
Have you ever fed her before?

53
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
No

54
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:54,080
What's this?

55
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,910
I cooked, so
you go feed her

56
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,120
Go on.
Else she'll wake up

57
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:07,290
Go, don't be afraid

58
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,290
I say, go on!

59
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,710
Sadashiv!

60
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:03,250
&lt;Chanting&gt;

61
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:13,160
Did he give you the gold coin?

62
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,790
It didn't come up

63
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:18,830
That bastard will never bring it up

64
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:23,040
You dare to swear at your father?

65
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:27,750
Tell him ...

66
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:31,210
We won't look after his old hag
unless he gives us the coin

67
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:33,910
No one else in the village
would dare to go close to her

68
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:37,500
The gold coin is not a joke

69
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:39,410
One has to earn it

70
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:42,000
Being his mistress for 12 years
hasn't earned it?

71
00:10:58,790 --> 00:10:59,710
Mother!

72
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:19,000
Let me go

73
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:25,160
I don't want it

74
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:28,120
I don't want the treasure

75
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:44,660
Let me go

76
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,830
Come in

77
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:54,960
Sleep, else Hastar will come for you

78
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:06,080
Mother?

79
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:08,330
Sarkar is dead

80
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,000
I know

81
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,660
After dinner,
we'll start packing

82
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,460
We are leaving Tumbbad

83
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:22,290
-There is nothing left for us here.
-Why?

84
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:25,460
Don't we inherit the mansion now?
There's no one else

85
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:27,460
And starve to death
in that ruin?

86
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,620
It isn't worth a penny

87
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:32,540
For the village, we are
as good as outcastes

88
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,580
And the mansion's hidden treasure.
Isn't that ours now?

89
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:40,120
Sarkar searched all his life
but found nothing

90
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,750
Squandered all his ancestral wealth as well

91
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:46,750
What about the old woman?

92
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,500
Why should we care now. Let her rot

93
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,290
Shall we wake her up?

94
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,500
She's Sarkar's great grandmother

95
00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:00,620
I'm sure she knows something
about the hidden treasure

96
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,830
Go!

97
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:05,160
Go ahead

98
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,330
Wake her up and ask

99
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,120
We leave at dawn, tomorrow

100
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,580
And head to 'Pune'

101
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:35,790
Even mentioning the treasure
brings ill fortune

102
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:37,540
So, I didn't

103
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,290
What is 'Pune'?

104
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:50,160
It's a very big city

105
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:54,370
Where carts move on their own,
without horses or bulls

106
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,330
I don't believe anything
you say, nowadays

107
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,710
Fine.

108
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:09,960
Sadashiv!

109
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,000
Mother!

110
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,660
Sadashiv, don't sleep.

111
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:41,620
I'll be back home by morning

112
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,120
What about the old woman's food?

113
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:48,410
-You'll have to feed her tonight.
-What if she wakes up?

114
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:50,120
If she wakes up, say ...

115
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,870
"Sleep, 'Hastar' will come for you."

116
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,080
Who is 'Hastar'?

117
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:57,330
Hurry up. Let's go!

118
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:00,460
-Mother?
-You go!

119
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:02,870
Go!

120
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:09,370
Sadashiv, I am here.
Everything will be alright, son

121
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,710
Sister?

122
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,710
Do you still want to go
to the doctor?

123
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:09,210
Or should I take us
to the graveyard?

124
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,620
Take me to the mansion

125
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:54,830
Who is this little prince?

126
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:57,330
Come here, my child!

127
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:00,790
&lt;Chanting&gt;

128
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,540
Open the door, my child

129
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:12,910
I am so hungry...
I need to eat something

130
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:17,370
Treasure!

131
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:21,160
Do you want it?

132
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:30,710
Treasure!

133
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,040
Come.

134
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,500
Come now.

135
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,410
Open it.

136
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,830
Put that light away, moron

137
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,790
Have you no brains?
It's hurting me

138
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:56,370
Grandmother ...

139
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:58,870
Son ...

140
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:00,410
Grandmother ...

141
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:02,290
Sorry, my boy.
Seeing light after a long time

142
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:05,500
Ah, butterfly ... another one ...

143
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:07,460
come here, my love

144
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:08,750
Where's the treasure?

145
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:13,080
-Grandmother?
-Look how they treat your grandma

146
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,660
Locked my jaw with sharp nails

147
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:20,830
Please put some food in this tube

148
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,710
Is it in the mansion?

149
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:30,040
Is it in the mansion?

150
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,620
I am hungry

151
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:42,540
Feed me and I'll
tell you everything

152
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:51,410
Or should I just eat you?

153
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:10,750
Sleep or else ...

154
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,710
What was it?

155
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,250
Sleep or else ...

156
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:19,830
'Hiran' will come.

157
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,000
Sleep or else ... Magar will come ...

158
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,660
Sleep or else ... Hachkar will come ...

159
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:26,370
'Sleep or else ... Haathi will come'

160
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:27,410
Sleep or else ...

161
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:34,120
'Sleep or else, Haathi will come ... Hiran ...'

162
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,120
Sleep or else ...

163
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:49,290
You forgot 'His' name, huh?

164
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:55,370
Mother!

165
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:57,210
I'll sing you a lullaby

166
00:22:59,000 --> 00:22:59,830
Let me go!

167
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,750
Tonight I'll taste your flesh

168
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:05,910
Brat! Don't act smart

169
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:07,040
Grandmother, sleep or else ...

170
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:18,210
Go to sleep ...

171
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:36,080
Sleep or else 'Habbad' will come

172
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:54,620
HASTAR!

173
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:01,870
Grandmother, sleep or 'Hastar' will come for you!

174
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:56,370
Vinayak! Open the door

175
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:10,660
Mother ...

176
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,660
Mother ...

177
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,370
where is Sadashiv?

178
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,330
There's still time.
Let's go back

179
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:50,120
We'll tie her up and
get it out of her

180
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:52,580
We won't feed her
till she tells us

181
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:53,750
I know how to handle her now.

182
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:56,080
-Let's go back, mother.
-Shut up!

183
00:25:58,290 --> 00:25:59,410
You little rascal ...

184
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:04,210
This is all you care for, right?

185
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,620
Keep it and shut your gob

186
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,040
It's just a single coin

187
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:22,830
Let's turn the boat around

188
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:27,290
We'll torture her
till she tells us, okay?

189
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:29,830
Keep quiet!

190
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:33,330
You're just like that serpent,
your father

191
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:37,660
I'll kill you,
if you ever return to Tumbbad

192
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:38,580
Understood?

193
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:40,960
Say it. Say you'll never
come back to Tumbbad!

194
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:41,960
Mother!

195
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:43,790
I'll throw it!

196
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:45,750
Do it!

197
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:48,710
-I'll do it!
-Go ahead!

198
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:53,750
You don't have the balls to do it

199
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,830
You're a greedy bastard

200
00:26:57,250 --> 00:27:00,870
I will kill you! Swear you'll never return to Tumbbad

201
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:01,960
Swear on me!

202
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,000
I will kill you! Swear you'll
never return to Tumbbad

203
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,540
Or else I'll kill you right here!

204
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:09,080
I wish you had died
instead of your little brother

205
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:11,370
Have you lost your mind?

206
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:12,830
I will throw you in the river

207
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:16,500
Swear you'll
never return to Tumbbad

208
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:18,080
Are you crazy?

209
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:21,620
Swear!

210
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:22,620
Quiet!

211
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:28,120
Calm down!

212
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:30,500
I'll never come back
to Tumbbad!

213
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,000
Grandmother ...

214
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,080
Grandmother ...

215
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:25,160
My child ...

216
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:28,160
You came back!

217
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:49,250
Grandma, a tree grew out of you!

218
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:57,710
Why didn't they banish you,
after your husband's death?

219
00:31:57,710 --> 00:32:01,660
Because they needed me

220
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:05,660
I was the fastest
climbing down the well

221
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:08,330
-Is treasure in the well?
-Don't go there!

222
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:11,120
Save yourself from this curse

223
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:14,790
The last time it ended with
me turning into a monster

224
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:18,160
Don't start the cycle
of destruction again

225
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:20,330
I won't go there, grandma

226
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:23,000
Don't try to fool me.
You're my blood

227
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,330
Bastard!

228
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:27,210
Tell me where it is
and I'll give you half of it

229
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:29,290
I don't want the treasure

230
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:31,330
Then, what do you want?

231
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:34,910
Freedom!

232
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:38,410
Give me that fire

233
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:46,040
You can't end my eternal hunger
but you can make this pain go away

234
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:50,080
I've waited too long, my child.
I can't take it anymore

235
00:32:52,330 --> 00:33:00,000
Entering those gates is your choice,
after that nothing else will be

236
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:07,580
Not everything you inherit
should be claimed, son

237
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:10,370
If I won't,
someone will

238
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,080
You're a greedy bastard!

239
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,290
It's my only quality

240
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,500
Are you sure you want this?

241
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,410
Just do it, my child

242
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:56,910
Do it, now!

243
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:44,660
'We sell freshly ground wheat'

244
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:47,290
Who is he?

245
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:50,040
Hey! What do you want?

246
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:53,000
Who are you?
Who is this man?

247
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,830
I don't know.
Let me call father

248
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:55,620
Thief!

249
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:58,620
Thief! Thief!

250
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:00,080
Shut up!

251
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:05,540
It's Vinayak Rao

252
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:09,080
Her husband.
Looks like a beggar now

253
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:17,250
Where were you?

254
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,790
I had no money left ...

255
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,370
people were saying all
kinds of things ...

256
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:26,080
So I started this business to survive ...

257
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:29,000
You want to be an
independent woman now?

258
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,330
You want to be free?

259
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:31,660
Sorry, my mistake

260
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:33,500
-I shouldn't have ...
-Come here!

261
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:34,790
No, please...

262
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,500
You want tp grind
flour, don't you?

263
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,790
Grind it for me from now ...

264
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,330
and see how
I'll make you a queen

265
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:45,410
Let me go

266
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:47,580
Let me go!

267
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:51,790
-It will tear.
-I'll get you more, madame

268
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:53,160
Where were you for
so many days?

269
00:36:56,290 --> 00:36:58,080
Wait! Neighbors will hear us

270
00:36:58,830 --> 00:36:59,960
Let me shut the door

271
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:17,910
Ring the bell only once.
I'm not deaf

272
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:26,790
I've been saving money
for an opium permit

273
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,830
Been in talks with an officer too

274
00:37:29,370 --> 00:37:31,410
Once I am rich ...

275
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,620
I'll need a clever assistant like you

276
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:36,370
Hope you don't charge for compliments

277
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:39,960
Your overdue interest is now
higher than the principal

278
00:37:41,370 --> 00:37:42,460
How will you repay me?

279
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:45,210
Work 3 months for me,
we'll be even

280
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:49,710
I have a gold coin.
Want to buy it?

281
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,290
Let me see

282
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:05,000
Where did you find it?

283
00:38:05,290 --> 00:38:06,580
Why do you care?

284
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,870
I'd like to know if it is stolen

285
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,160
I'd tell you if it were

286
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,330
It's ancestral

287
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:16,960
Times have gone so bad, huh?

288
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:24,040
It costs 100 rupees.
I owe you 38 rupees

289
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:26,660
-That leaves 62 rupees.
-Yes, right

290
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:31,500
I have three more.
Interested?

291
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:53,750
Each particle shines, with a sheen of gold ...
every ear listens

292
00:38:56,290 --> 00:39:01,790
To this splendid song, to this tune of wealth ...
I searched the entire earth

293
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:04,410
Are you from Tumbbad?

294
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:09,710
They say there's a treasure
hidden in Sarkar's mansion

295
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:11,040
Is it true or just a rumour?

296
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,330
It's true

297
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,000
Go

298
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,120
Loot it!

299
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:25,750
To this splendid song, to this tune of wealth ...
I searched the entire earth

300
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:34,830
Come, come conquer Tumbbad.

301
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:37,910
Just two?

302
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:40,500
Can't you get all
the coins together?

303
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:49,710
The clouds erupt, yet my soul
Burns like an ember

304
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:50,830
16?

305
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,250
I don't have enough cash for this

306
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:56,460
Now you owe me money

307
00:39:56,790 --> 00:39:59,330
Hope you aren't killing
anyone for these

308
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,710
Consignment for Rajaji?

309
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:20,960
Gift for my girlfriend

310
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:23,080
Never known you to be so generous

311
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:24,870
Hey Raghav!

312
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:28,540
-Does he work for you?
-Who?

313
00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:33,330
That little bird who's been at
your house these past weeks

314
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:36,830
Oh! He doesn't work for anyone

315
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:38,080
He is his own master

316
00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:39,660
Raghav!

317
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:42,410
Who is he?

318
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:46,040
A man of small stature.
He is a nobody

319
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:49,250
You better hurry up with
whatever you're planning to do

320
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:54,500
That opium permit is yours for
the taking, but only for now

321
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:56,330
It won't remain that way forever

322
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:59,620
But my days are going
to change soon

323
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:01,040
Listen

324
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:03,460
I am getting promoted in a month

325
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:05,460
I'm getting out of this Jungle Book

326
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:10,250
There won't be anyone to link you
with Superintendent Sahib then

327
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:13,330
You have one month!

328
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:28,710
And I got angry ...

329
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:31,290
I wished
mother would just die

330
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:32,960
Then it so happened ...

331
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:35,040
mother died the very next day

332
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:38,460
I even had a brother
who died young

333
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:43,290
I felt anyone who ill-treated me,
would just die

334
00:41:44,830 --> 00:41:47,460
I mean, that's what I used to think

335
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:51,500
Where is Vinayak Rao
getting these coins from?

336
00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:54,040
I don't know

337
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,410
-You don't know?
- No.

338
00:41:56,120 --> 00:42:00,410
Don't ever feel I wish badly upon you.
Or I too will ...

339
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,960
No, no! That was just
a childish thought

340
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:05,120
Right, no?

341
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,790
Namaste Vinayak Rao

342
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:12,290
Weren't you supposed to
come tomorrow?

343
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:16,540
Yes ... no, I was just passing by

344
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,040
So I thought ...

345
00:42:19,330 --> 00:42:23,750
Your consignment arrived.
So I thought I should get it

346
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,210
Very good!

347
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:27,660
It's like magic!

348
00:42:29,370 --> 00:42:31,120
How did you hurt your leg?

349
00:42:31,290 --> 00:42:32,120
I fell down ...

350
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:35,120
-Whom were you running from?
-Play an Indian song

351
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:37,660
Oh! We'll need another
record for that

352
00:42:37,870 --> 00:42:38,910
Another record?

353
00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:41,910
-So this is of no use?
-No, that's not the case

354
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:43,790
All of this is good

355
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,790
This is what you call a record

356
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:49,910
Oh, okay

357
00:42:50,210 --> 00:42:53,660
The injury looks bad. Hope your
husband is not a freedom fighter

358
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:56,210
No, but I am

359
00:42:57,460 --> 00:43:00,620
Our neighbour took me to the
civil disobedience march

360
00:43:00,790 --> 00:43:03,250
She asked me to bring
all our English goods

361
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:06,750
I took just that old English doll,
to throw in the bonfire

362
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:10,120
Excellent!
It was only for 10 rupees

363
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:15,160
-May I say something?
-Sure

364
00:43:15,330 --> 00:43:17,040
You should buy yourself a motorbike

365
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:21,120
Travelling in buses
doesn't suit you anymore

366
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:24,620
-There's one motorcycle ...
-Come now, let's go

367
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:29,080
Yes, let's go.
You must be tired

368
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:37,500
-I'll take your leave, dear.
-Yes, but visit again

369
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:40,500
It's like my own house,
why wouldn't I come?

370
00:43:41,210 --> 00:43:42,370
Of course.

371
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:43,870
Your tea

372
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:47,000
Go inside

373
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:55,910
Say, why don't you make me
your business partner?

374
00:43:56,250 --> 00:43:59,960
Half the risk,
Double the profit

375
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:02,370
Why do you want any risk at all?

376
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:04,750
-You already have a good business.
-No...

377
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:07,160
I just worry about you

378
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:09,910
You deal in so much money

379
00:44:10,710 --> 00:44:12,500
Do you even keep accounts?

380
00:44:13,870 --> 00:44:17,160
You keep your accounts,
I'll keep my courage!

381
00:44:20,710 --> 00:44:21,620
Okay?

382
00:44:22,370 --> 00:44:23,330
Okay

383
00:44:26,790 --> 00:44:28,790
Raghav ji, listen ...

384
00:44:31,370 --> 00:44:34,290
If you ever need anything,
please don't hesitate ...

385
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:37,750
Even if you need money.
I won't charge interest

386
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,830
You look worried today

387
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:42,750
No, it's nothing.
- Huh?

388
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:44,410
It's nothing

389
00:44:45,410 --> 00:44:46,290
Is everything okay?

390
00:44:46,370 --> 00:44:47,500
Yes

391
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:49,960
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye

392
00:45:04,790 --> 00:45:08,540
This madman roamed around like a fool

393
00:45:08,870 --> 00:45:12,460
Fighting for days, he fell into a dark night

394
00:45:12,790 --> 00:45:16,370
Wrote his own unwritten destiny

395
00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:19,580
Once unstoppable, his mind trapped in luxury

396
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:21,870
You look like royalty.

397
00:45:22,330 --> 00:45:24,410
The darkness was in the past

398
00:45:24,830 --> 00:45:28,410
A bright future beckoned

399
00:45:28,830 --> 00:45:32,410
My ambition shined through

400
00:45:32,870 --> 00:45:36,460
It purified my soul

401
00:45:36,830 --> 00:45:42,160
I wandered destitute,
extracted gold from dust

402
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:45,960
Hey Raghav!

403
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:49,290
I've reduced my cut to 2000

404
00:45:50,910 --> 00:45:52,620
My promotion came through

405
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,710
This is your last
chance to be rich

406
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,250
Hey Raghav!

407
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:12,160
Cooper Sahib!

408
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,790
Hey... move fast!

409
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:19,250
Who is she?

410
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:21,250
Daughter-in-law!

411
00:46:28,210 --> 00:46:29,710
Two days ...

412
00:46:35,870 --> 00:46:37,790
I owed you 803 rupees ...

413
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:41,870
I got her for 800

414
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:44,290
800?

415
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:45,830
Is it too much
or too less?

416
00:46:46,250 --> 00:46:47,210
Too much, of course

417
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:49,040
She was to be burned
on her husband's pyre

418
00:46:49,290 --> 00:46:50,870
Had to pay them well

419
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,910
But I didn't let
them shave her head

420
00:46:54,370 --> 00:46:55,910
And the balance 3 rupees?

421
00:46:56,750 --> 00:46:59,410
I could have said she
cost me 803 rupees, no?

422
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:03,960
Look at this.
It costs 7 rupees in the market

423
00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:06,960
I got it for 3,
so you take it for 3

424
00:47:07,870 --> 00:47:11,660
This cargo was headed to America
but was sent back here

425
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:16,250
There's widespread poverty.
People have no money there

426
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:19,210
Bad times!

427
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:23,870
Keep this as a gift

428
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:26,080
It's too good to
give away for free

429
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:29,210
Want to see a parrot?
There's one here, look

430
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:40,210
Who is she?

431
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:43,710
Didn't you want a maid?

432
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:47,410
Yes. But how do you know
she's any good?

433
00:47:47,830 --> 00:47:50,750
-I've checked, she's good.
-See, he knows

434
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:53,210
Where will she stay?

435
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:58,120
-How about upstairs?
-She'll stay anywhere

436
00:47:58,710 --> 00:48:00,580
Show her upstairs

437
00:48:03,790 --> 00:48:06,080
How are times any better here?

438
00:48:06,830 --> 00:48:09,330
It's that Gandhi's undoing!

439
00:48:09,370 --> 00:48:11,580
-Listen
-This "Women Empowerment" speech ...

440
00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:14,370
has brainwashed them

441
00:48:15,790 --> 00:48:18,210
The British government is great

442
00:48:19,370 --> 00:48:22,000
Sure, they interfere with
our religion ...

443
00:48:22,330 --> 00:48:23,660
But, what can you do?

444
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:02,750
What is it?

445
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:08,000
If you give me another 50 ...

446
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:11,410
I'll tell you where
I got this 50 from

447
00:49:15,540 --> 00:49:18,210
What if your information
is not worth 50?

448
00:49:20,330 --> 00:49:22,040
What if it's worth millions?

449
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:32,870
Take

450
00:49:37,910 --> 00:49:39,040
He asked me ...

451
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:41,410
to spend the night with you

452
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:43,460
-What did he say?
-For two nights ...

453
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:45,290
and two days ...

454
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:48,160
not to let you
leave town

455
00:49:59,750 --> 00:50:01,080
To make sure ...

456
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:04,960
for next 2 days ...

457
00:50:05,410 --> 00:50:08,660
you don't leave the town

458
01:00:22,710 --> 01:00:24,250
Go to sleep, Raghav ...

459
01:00:26,790 --> 01:00:30,160
Go to sleep or else 'Hastar'
will come for you!

460
01:02:05,790 --> 01:02:08,000
Hastar!

461
01:03:11,330 --> 01:03:13,540
I know what you've been up to

462
01:03:13,830 --> 01:03:19,250
Right under my nose?
How dare you, you?

463
01:03:33,580 --> 01:03:38,290
Sister, I haven't even
touched your husband

464
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:43,620
I know all your tricks,
you dirty, lying witch!

465
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:47,580
I'm going to throw you out

466
01:03:49,210 --> 01:03:50,210
What happened?

467
01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:52,210
She stole my brooch

468
01:03:52,370 --> 01:03:53,750
I did no such thing

469
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:56,710
I didn't choose to come here.
I have had enough ...

470
01:03:56,910 --> 01:03:57,750
Quiet!

471
01:03:58,660 --> 01:04:00,710
I'll break your face
if I hear another word

472
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,410
You won't live here anymore

473
01:04:03,580 --> 01:04:04,960
Get out!

474
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:06,210
You will not stay here!

475
01:04:07,460 --> 01:04:08,750
What happened?

476
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:11,870
-She can't live in our house anymore.
- Huh?

477
01:06:13,460 --> 01:06:14,290
11

478
01:06:18,790 --> 01:06:20,040
22

479
01:06:27,910 --> 01:06:28,750
3

480
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:12,370
Empty, again?

481
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:16,120
This is the third time in a year

482
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:17,120
Quiet!

483
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,080
Hold your tongue

484
01:07:20,210 --> 01:07:22,710
Tired of your whining

485
01:07:27,790 --> 01:07:29,460
Seems to have forgotten her place

486
01:07:29,620 --> 01:07:32,870
I say this because I'm
worried about you

487
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:37,330
You can't run like this
all your life

488
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:42,210
When will your boy be ready?

489
01:07:45,540 --> 01:07:47,540
He's of no use

490
01:08:23,160 --> 01:08:25,620
Father, training was great today

491
01:08:25,870 --> 01:08:28,580
I picked 8 coins in my 19th attempt

492
01:08:42,250 --> 01:08:44,370
What's the most you've ever picked?

493
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:17,790
Yes ...

494
01:09:24,620 --> 01:09:26,250
I can't arrange this week either

495
01:09:26,410 --> 01:09:28,580
Let's talk next week

496
01:09:29,080 --> 01:09:31,540
Yes, good night

497
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:50,040
I'm going to Tumbbad tomorrow.
Keep Pandurang ready

498
01:09:53,250 --> 01:09:56,080
Really? Father said this?

499
01:09:57,460 --> 01:10:01,080
Yes. Tomorrow, you will also
go to Tumbbad

500
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,750
It's time you start
helping your father

501
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:06,870
What happens there, though?

502
01:10:10,330 --> 01:10:11,540
I don't know

503
01:10:12,580 --> 01:10:14,620
What do I have to do?

504
01:10:18,460 --> 01:10:20,120
You'll know soon ...

505
01:10:21,620 --> 01:10:23,160
then, you tell me

506
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:51,500
You'd said you'd take me
when I am 16

507
01:11:51,620 --> 01:11:54,330
-But I learnt quickly ...
-Speak softly, I'm not deaf!

508
01:11:57,580 --> 01:12:01,370
When were you ready?
At my age or at 16?

509
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:04,210
You are not ready yet!

510
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:11,870
What's in Tumbbad?

511
01:12:15,460 --> 01:12:17,870
If there was a god
whose mere touch ...

512
01:12:18,750 --> 01:12:20,250
would turn you immortal ...

513
01:12:20,500 --> 01:12:22,290
letting you live for centuries ...

514
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,830
and you'd know where
the eternal treasure is

515
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:28,160
All you have to do
is eat and sleep

516
01:12:29,710 --> 01:12:30,960
Would you want that?

517
01:12:32,370 --> 01:12:34,120
Who wouldn't want
such a blessing?

518
01:12:35,910 --> 01:12:37,620
One knows it's not a blessing ...

519
01:12:38,290 --> 01:12:40,290
but a curse worse than death!

520
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:48,250
I think I'll be coming
back home alone today

521
01:12:49,580 --> 01:12:50,540
Why, father?

522
01:12:51,790 --> 01:12:54,210
Father, I'm just like you

523
01:12:54,580 --> 01:12:55,750
I'm not afraid of anything!

524
01:12:59,410 --> 01:13:00,620
I'm not scaring you ...

525
01:13:01,250 --> 01:13:04,580
just preparing you
for what lies ahead

526
01:13:08,330 --> 01:13:09,960
Is that God the same one ...

527
01:13:10,250 --> 01:13:12,710
"Sleep or else Hastar will..."
-Shh ...

528
01:13:13,460 --> 01:13:14,910
Don't utter his name

529
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:18,620
He appears even if you
take his name?

530
01:13:26,250 --> 01:13:30,370
Since that day, the Gods' wrath
has rained on Tumbbad

531
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:33,250
But why did they wake him up?

532
01:13:33,830 --> 01:13:36,960
Because Hastar's curse
is a boon for us

533
01:13:37,540 --> 01:13:38,410
What do you mean?

534
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:41,410
You'll know when you go inside

535
01:13:42,540 --> 01:13:43,540
Inside what?

536
01:13:45,790 --> 01:13:47,410
The Goddess's womb

537
01:14:30,580 --> 01:14:34,370
Mix in these pebbles.
He chews through them

538
01:14:35,460 --> 01:14:37,000
It buys us more time

539
01:14:46,290 --> 01:14:47,080
Listen ...

540
01:14:47,250 --> 01:14:51,000
We here just to practice today.
We won't need these inside

541
01:15:10,290 --> 01:15:13,410
Scared already?
We haven't even begun

542
01:15:18,330 --> 01:15:22,410
Make a circle. It keeps us safe.
He cannot enter it

543
01:15:22,870 --> 01:15:24,290
What if he tries to?

544
01:15:24,750 --> 01:15:26,080
It will destroy him

545
01:15:26,830 --> 01:15:31,910
Remember, he took the gold,
but couldn't get the grains

546
01:15:32,500 --> 01:15:35,250
Hence, he yearns for
flour and dreads it too

547
01:15:35,580 --> 01:15:37,330
But what if Hastar bites you?

548
01:15:37,540 --> 01:15:39,870
You'll be cursed like grandmother.
Get it here

549
01:15:52,370 --> 01:15:53,460
Is that the grandmother?

550
01:15:53,660 --> 01:15:56,040
No, he was my friend

551
01:15:56,250 --> 01:15:57,500
Did Hastar do this?

552
01:15:58,580 --> 01:15:59,330
Yes

553
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:05,290
When will Hastar come?

554
01:16:06,830 --> 01:16:08,910
When we offer him the dough doll

555
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:12,870
But we're just practicing,
that's why we didn't bring it

556
01:16:13,540 --> 01:16:15,040
Pull this from here

557
01:16:18,250 --> 01:16:19,830
But I got the doll

558
01:16:23,750 --> 01:16:25,330
Run, you fool!

559
01:16:26,160 --> 01:16:27,000
Father!

560
01:16:46,120 --> 01:16:47,160
Wait for me, father

561
01:16:59,160 --> 01:17:00,620
You, greedy scum!

562
01:17:01,410 --> 01:17:03,790
Didn't I ask you to
not get the doll?

563
01:17:04,210 --> 01:17:06,250
Didn't I?

564
01:17:07,710 --> 01:17:08,960
Sorry ...

565
01:17:12,120 --> 01:17:14,660
Stay here.
Or I'll chop your head off!

566
01:17:26,750 --> 01:17:28,080
Look over there

567
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:30,540
Has gone even blind now

568
01:17:36,620 --> 01:17:39,040
Keep it safe,
It's your first earning

569
01:17:40,830 --> 01:17:43,210
How much will I get
if I sell this?

570
01:17:43,790 --> 01:17:46,040
Give it back ... quick!

571
01:17:46,330 --> 01:17:48,040
I'll keep it safe

572
01:17:48,580 --> 01:17:50,460
Until I don't ask for it

573
01:17:54,540 --> 01:17:56,540
Tell me, what was there?

574
01:17:58,330 --> 01:18:00,500
That's between father and me

575
01:18:01,460 --> 01:18:02,910
You focus on household chores

576
01:18:36,290 --> 01:18:37,580
Unwrap it

577
01:18:52,540 --> 01:18:53,540
Eat it

578
01:19:12,500 --> 01:19:14,540
Your father gave this to you?

579
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:18,540
Does he like it too?

580
01:19:19,250 --> 01:19:21,660
He doesn't like anything

581
01:19:24,370 --> 01:19:26,710
Then what's the point?

582
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:30,460
What do you mean?

583
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:35,580
Mother, what do you mean?

584
01:19:38,330 --> 01:19:42,750
Greetings to the free
citizen of free India

585
01:19:43,250 --> 01:19:45,160
Welcome Raja Sahib

586
01:19:47,540 --> 01:19:50,910
This is for the
new water station

587
01:19:52,580 --> 01:19:54,960
Name it after my wife

588
01:20:00,160 --> 01:20:04,870
Now that India is free,
how will you keep busy?

589
01:20:05,750 --> 01:20:09,120
You think our freedom struggle
was to keep us busy?

590
01:20:10,290 --> 01:20:11,290
No?

591
01:20:12,290 --> 01:20:14,460
You're insulting me

592
01:20:15,250 --> 01:20:18,410
This land they looted and
partitioned is yours too

593
01:20:18,830 --> 01:20:23,620
That's why we seek your donation ...
and your sympathy

594
01:20:27,250 --> 01:20:31,160
Forget sympathy,
take more donation

595
01:20:34,710 --> 01:20:39,750
Your house is decaying.
Doesn't match your stature

596
01:20:41,250 --> 01:20:43,830
It's time you buy a grander mansion

597
01:20:44,830 --> 01:20:47,370
-I have one in Tumbbad ...
-Tumbbad?

598
01:20:47,870 --> 01:20:49,540
Tumbbad has been given away last week

599
01:20:51,580 --> 01:20:52,580
What?

600
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:55,370
If only you'd listened to me

601
01:20:55,540 --> 01:20:57,870
We would've drawn out legal papers
and it would have been yours

602
01:20:58,040 --> 01:21:00,370
Tumbbad is under the
lordship of 7 barons

603
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:02,910
I take good care of each of them

604
01:21:03,540 --> 01:21:06,500
-That's between you and the barons.
-Whom did they give away Tumbbad to?

605
01:21:06,870 --> 01:21:08,160
To the new Sarkar

606
01:21:10,160 --> 01:21:11,000
Who is this Sarkar?

607
01:21:11,290 --> 01:21:12,750
The Indian Government

608
01:21:14,500 --> 01:21:16,330
It's a decrepit mansion anyway

609
01:21:17,460 --> 01:21:21,080
They'll build a new village there

610
01:21:22,410 --> 01:21:26,870
I'll look for something else
that matches your status

611
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:30,660
Namaste

612
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:00,080
What is it?

613
01:22:02,910 --> 01:22:04,910
Why are you standing
like that?

614
01:22:06,040 --> 01:22:07,460
What are you staring at?

615
01:22:15,290 --> 01:22:17,000
Should I wake up everybody?

616
01:22:18,910 --> 01:22:20,710
Father tells you everything,
doesn't he?

617
01:22:21,580 --> 01:22:23,330
He must've told you
about this as well

618
01:22:24,790 --> 01:22:26,620
I'm his partner now

619
01:22:27,080 --> 01:22:29,540
And soon I'll be the only one
running the show

620
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:32,540
You do know what I mean, right?

621
01:22:34,290 --> 01:22:36,620
Father has kept you
as a mistress ...

622
01:22:36,910 --> 01:22:40,330
No big deal in that.
Everyone has one

623
01:22:42,620 --> 01:22:45,830
But when I grow up,
I'll marry you

624
01:22:49,540 --> 01:22:51,210
Are you crazy?

625
01:22:53,540 --> 01:22:54,750
How old are you?

626
01:22:56,370 --> 01:22:58,250
Does that matter to you?

627
01:23:30,910 --> 01:23:35,160
If not Tumbbad, at least
the mansion is ours, right?

628
01:23:38,210 --> 01:23:40,830
The government will lock it up too

629
01:23:41,410 --> 01:23:43,080
But why?

630
01:23:44,750 --> 01:23:45,620
You fool

631
01:23:46,290 --> 01:23:47,330
Come here

632
01:23:48,500 --> 01:23:49,750
Idiot

633
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:09,040
Take the keys, stupid

634
01:24:09,830 --> 01:24:11,120
Here

635
01:24:14,830 --> 01:24:15,660
Open

636
01:24:19,870 --> 01:24:20,710
Pull harder

637
01:24:29,500 --> 01:24:31,330
So much gold!

638
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,040
This will last a lifetime

639
01:24:35,500 --> 01:24:37,710
You're just like my mother

640
01:24:37,870 --> 01:24:41,540
She thought a coin
would last a lifetime

641
01:24:53,910 --> 01:24:55,620
Mother!

642
01:24:57,330 --> 01:24:58,540
Father!

643
01:25:00,660 --> 01:25:02,250
Wake up, father!

644
01:25:06,460 --> 01:25:11,410
Father ... wake up please

645
01:25:26,910 --> 01:25:28,830
You want to be a man, huh?

646
01:25:28,830 --> 01:25:31,210
I'll break your other leg too!

647
01:25:31,620 --> 01:25:32,500
Bastard!

648
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:35,250
Just because I spoke to you,
you think you can fool me?

649
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:37,710
What are you looking at?

650
01:25:38,660 --> 01:25:40,460
Want to gift her a coin, huh?

651
01:25:59,580 --> 01:26:00,330
Stop!

652
01:26:00,830 --> 01:26:03,370
Where are you going?
-To get my coin back

653
01:26:04,410 --> 01:26:06,410
You want your coin?
Let me give you one

654
01:26:06,580 --> 01:26:08,080
-MOTHER!
-Today you'll die

655
01:26:08,460 --> 01:26:09,500
I'm going to wring your neck

656
01:26:09,870 --> 01:26:12,080
Tie you to a rock
and throw you in a river

657
01:26:12,250 --> 01:26:14,250
That should take care of you

658
01:26:15,870 --> 01:26:17,290
Mother!

659
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:21,660
You've been doing it
the wrong way all along

660
01:26:22,210 --> 01:26:24,410
You will teach me what
is right, huh?

661
01:26:24,660 --> 01:26:29,210
The coins are in its loincloth,
so why not just steal the loincloth?

662
01:26:29,790 --> 01:26:32,000
-What?
-Let's steal 'Hastar's' loincloth

663
01:26:32,660 --> 01:26:36,620
You want 'Hastar's' loincloth, bastard?
How much time can we buy with that doll?

664
01:26:36,710 --> 01:26:38,750
We pick what we can and run!

665
01:26:39,790 --> 01:26:41,790
We will take many dolls

666
01:26:42,660 --> 01:26:46,250
As soon as he picks one,
we'll throw another and so on

667
01:26:54,580 --> 01:26:55,660
Father ...

668
01:26:56,330 --> 01:26:59,080
it won't take us long
to steal the loincloth

669
01:27:09,160 --> 01:27:10,750
Will he eat so many dolls?

670
01:27:11,460 --> 01:27:13,960
Didn't you say
he's always hungry?

671
01:27:16,500 --> 01:27:18,080
I know it's difficult

672
01:27:21,790 --> 01:27:23,250
But it's possible

673
01:27:24,620 --> 01:27:25,660
Come here

674
01:27:33,080 --> 01:27:35,160
Father, I am sorry.
I will not do it again

675
01:27:35,370 --> 01:27:38,960
Remain in your pants for a few years.
We'll get you married soon!

676
01:27:40,040 --> 01:27:41,160
And till then?

677
01:27:47,290 --> 01:27:48,410
And till then!

678
01:27:59,660 --> 01:28:03,410
He plays hide and seek, like the Reaper

679
01:28:03,660 --> 01:28:07,250
Spins a web of laughter and cries

680
01:28:07,660 --> 01:28:11,250
He stares into your soul with lust

681
01:28:11,710 --> 01:28:15,290
Hits you at every turn, like kingdom come

682
01:28:15,710 --> 01:28:19,290
For ages he has starved

683
01:28:19,710 --> 01:28:23,290
Waiting unfulfilled, unnourished

684
01:28:23,710 --> 01:28:27,290
He endlessly eats stones-pebbles-wheat

685
01:28:27,660 --> 01:28:31,250
Eternally thirsty, drinks with gruesome greed

686
01:28:31,710 --> 01:28:37,040
Ears quiver, bearings adrift

687
01:28:39,580 --> 01:28:45,080
He's the god of death,
life and heart shiver

688
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:54,250
Come, come conquer Tumbbad.

689
01:28:55,000 --> 01:29:03,120
Go, go revel in Tumbbad

690
01:29:03,620 --> 01:29:09,120
The clouds erupt, yet my soul
Burns like an ember

691
01:29:11,620 --> 01:29:18,870
Every moment, my mind splits, my body
is pierced . The world is up in the air

692
01:29:49,290 --> 01:29:50,750
Come here

693
01:29:52,620 --> 01:29:54,080
Hold this

694
01:29:56,370 --> 01:29:57,960
Shall we begin, father?

695
01:30:48,290 --> 01:30:51,540
Stop! Put the dolls back!

696
01:30:55,120 --> 01:30:58,210
Father!

697
01:33:37,460 --> 01:33:39,870
Father! Please, no

698
01:33:40,460 --> 01:33:42,910
We'll find another way

699
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:46,290
Father, don't do this please

700
01:33:46,540 --> 01:33:48,290
Take the dolls off, father!

701
01:33:50,210 --> 01:33:52,040
Father don't do this.
Father!

702
01:36:12,410 --> 01:36:14,250
Father?

703
01:36:25,410 --> 01:36:26,960
Take it

704
01:36:29,120 --> 01:36:30,960
The loincloth!

705
01:36:36,210 --> 01:36:37,000
Come

706
01:36:39,620 --> 01:36:40,410
Take it

707
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:46,790
Take it!

708
01:36:51,410 --> 01:36:52,830
Didn't you want this?

709
01:36:53,500 --> 01:36:56,120
Didn't you want this?
-No

710
01:36:56,870 --> 01:36:57,830
No!

711
01:36:59,410 --> 01:37:00,210
-Take it!
-No.

712
01:37:19,790 --> 01:37:21,540
Father, go to sleep ...

713
01:37:22,460 --> 01:37:25,160
Father, sleep or 'Hastar'
will come for you
