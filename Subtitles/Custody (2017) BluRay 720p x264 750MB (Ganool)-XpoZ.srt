1
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:53,318
Yes?

2
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:55,446
Hello.

3
00:01:55,574 --> 00:01:57,064
- I'm going down.
- Me too.

4
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:08,827
CUSTODY

5
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:44,574
I'll read Julien's statement.

6
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:47,536
This hearing was postponed to take it.

7
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:50,076
A word about his statement.

8
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:54,247
When we send children
to family mediation services

9
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:57,212
- I'll explain if you don't know -

10
00:02:57,386 --> 00:03:02,426
we tell them that what they say
will be shared with their parents.

11
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:06,634
If they don't want something shared,
they mustn't say it.

12
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:08,894
It's a matter of due process.

13
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:11,806
Everyone must be fully informed.

14
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:17,611
'Julien is '11. He's in 6th grade
at Monod Junior High in Saint-Dumont.

15
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:19,021
He said:

16
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,942
"My parents separated a year ago.
I live with Mom and my sister.

17
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,203
"There's a party
for my sister's 18th birthday.

18
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:28,956
"We live with Papy and Nana
except my father.

19
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:32,664
"Mom doesn't help with homework.
I'm a good student.

20
00:03:32,838 --> 00:03:36,172
"I have lots of friends
and get by fine."

21
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:40,463
Where was I?

22
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:45,010
"...lots of friends and get by fine.

23
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:49,347
"I can't play outside.
We're scared that man will come.

24
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:52,346
"Papy screams. It's not good for him.

25
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:55,767
"When he comes, I worry about Mom.
All he wants

26
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:57,275
"is to harass her."

27
00:03:57,446 --> 00:03:59,357
Listen to what I'm saying.

28
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,698
You can speak to your lawyer later.

29
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:08,029
"I worry about Mom.
He wants to hurt her.

30
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:10,948
"He's no father.
I'm glad they're divorcing.

31
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:14,744
"I can't leave my mom and sister alone."
Bad reason.

32
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:19,332
"Josephine dislikes him
but she's old enough to not see him.

33
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:21,341
"I won't see him either

34
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:24,469
"or be forced to
every other week

35
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:25,549
"or weekend.

36
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:27,965
"I won't see him again.
That's all."

37
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:29,884
Counselor, you may speak.

38
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:31,434
So...

39
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:34,305
Mrs. Besson receives...

40
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:37,851
an unemployment check
of 981 euros a month.

41
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:43,273
She's married to Antoine Besson,
who's in charge of fire safety

42
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,236
at Lecorney hospital.

43
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:48,528
He makes 2,200 euros a month.

44
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,536
They have two children.

45
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:54,826
Josephine will be 18,
so custody doesn't concern her.

46
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:58,792
But we have to establish
a new life for Julien.

47
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,252
It's why we took his statement.

48
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:05,711
We don't agree
with the other side's request.

49
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:10,846
Mr. Besson wants joint custody
once he moves to the area,

50
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:13,556
now that he was transferred here.

51
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,347
But as we can clearly observe,

52
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:19,768
the children don't want
to see their father again.

53
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:21,727
It's true that...

54
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:25,690
Julien expresses this desire
a bit forcefully.

55
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:27,859
He rejects his father.

56
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:32,117
His statement indicates tension
between the spouses,

57
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,827
but also extreme insecurity.

58
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,412
His own.

59
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:39,954
The case shows
why these children feel unsafe.

60
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:43,294
I provided
Josephine's medical certificate,

61
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:46,335
which shows the violence
she was subjected to

62
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:47,628
by her father.

63
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:52,721
So we ask that the children
reside permanently with their mother.

64
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:56,054
Josephine is almost an adult.

65
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:59,144
She can visit her father
as she wishes.

66
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:02,309
But we also ask
the same thing for Julien.

67
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:04,478
Until things calm down

68
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:07,774
and until he wants
to see his father again.

69
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,033
All this increases stress.

70
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:14,037
My client withdrew her complaint
to be conciliatory.

71
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:17,620
He threatened her
to make her withdraw it.

72
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:21,879
He'd call, go to her parents' house,
sleep in his car.

73
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:23,755
Do you have proof?

74
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:27,168
Her parents testified that he came...

75
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:29,427
I mean proof of threats.

76
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:33,594
No witnesses of course.
No messages saved.

77
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:35,805
She changed numbers repeatedly.

78
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:38,471
So, to be conciliatory yet again,

79
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:42,149
my client is not asking for alimony.

80
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:45,979
However, she is living with her parents.

81
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:50,650
She left everything she owned
personally and jointly

82
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,363
in their former home.

83
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:56,121
She must start from scratch.
She has no savings.

84
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:58,328
Yes, she's at her parents',

85
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:03,667
but she pays rent, helps out
and bears the cost of the children.

86
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:07,799
She has immediate
and essential expenses

87
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,710
to find a place to live.

88
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:12,004
So she requests an advance

89
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:15,174
of 5,000 euros
on her share of common property.

90
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:20,806
We request that you obligate
her husband to pay this.

91
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:24,558
Otherwise, we agree

92
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:28,855
to child support
totaling 110 per month, per child.

93
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,692
That's all I have on behalf of...

94
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,829
both the children and their mother.

95
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:39,828
Your turn, Counselor.

96
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:42,162
Thank you, Your Honor.

97
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:46,956
Julien said certain things
against his father,

98
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:51,544
but much has been read
into his statement.

99
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:54,804
I don't understand
the point of this hearing.

100
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:58,012
Nothing here is black and white.

101
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:02,271
Education is the responsibility
of both parents.

102
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:05,433
I'm shocked by what I just heard.

103
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:09,653
Mr. Besson was transferred
and requests joint custody

104
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:12,815
only to be accused of harassment,

105
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:16,277
of threats,
of violence against his daughter,

106
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:19,617
with a note from a school nurse
as proof?

107
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,116
I find it stupefying

108
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:24,785
and extremely inappropriate.

109
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:28,498
In my file,
you'll find several affidavits.

110
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:33,335
My client's parents,
also victims of her whims,

111
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:36,471
deprived of their grandkids
since the separation.

112
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:39,508
His colleagues, who describe him

113
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:44,226
as an excellent team leader,
well-balanced, calm, even-tempered.

114
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,767
Affidavits from members
of his hunting club,

115
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:54,532
describing him as generous, obliging,
a nature lover who doesn't drink.

116
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,446
A normal man,

117
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:59,611
who bears no resemblance

118
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:03,532
to the violent, threatening boor
portrayed here.

119
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:07,043
If Mrs. Besson has proof of threats,

120
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:10,672
let her show them
and the police can investigate.

121
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:14,335
But "harassment" and "threats"
don't describe

122
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:17,595
a hurt father reaching out
to his kids.

123
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:20,966
And I'm measuring my words.

124
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:25,350
Mrs. Besson severed all ties
with my client overnight.

125
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:27,222
And since then,

126
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,893
she's refused to let him
talk to his children.

127
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:33,438
Her parents' number is now unlisted.

128
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,106
Yes, it's true.

129
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:39,572
Mr. Besson did indeed sleep in his car

130
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:43,159
in front of her parents' house.
It's true.

131
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:49,086
Hoping to see his children,
not for the fun of sleeping in a car.

132
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:52,502
I can assure you that Mr. Besson is...

133
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:55,667
astounded to hear what Julien thinks.

134
00:09:55,845 --> 00:10:00,089
His son's words don't reflect
their time together.

135
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:04,760
Given the context,
we can suspect they're someone else's.

136
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:07,646
This is what Mr. Besson says now:

137
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:09,894
"My daughter is an adult.

138
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:13,652
"She'll make up her mind
about seeing me.

139
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:15,859
"But I won't abandon my son.

140
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:19,195
"I love him. He loves me.
And he needs me.

141
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:22,076
"I'm leaving my job,
colleagues, friends.

142
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:25,114
"I'm selling my house to be near my son,

143
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,908
"to keep enjoying time together."

144
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:33,544
Mrs. Besson can't take that away.
It's a child's basic right.

145
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:36,709
She claims he wasn't a good husband

146
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:40,004
but it doesn't mean he's a bad father.

147
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:44,259
The law doesn't allow us
to break the father-son bond.

148
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:47,348
So we still request the same thing.

149
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:50,059
A standard visitation schedule.

150
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:54,067
Every other weekend,
from noon Saturday to Sunday at 6 pm.

151
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:57,195
And when my client lives in the area,

152
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:59,902
joint physical custody:

153
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:03,068
every other week and shared vacations.

154
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:05,704
So we need her future address.

155
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:09,454
Unless she leaves on a whim again.

156
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:13,837
This is all to make
Julien's new life easier.

157
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:17,841
Otherwise, we agree to their request
for child support.

158
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:20,844
But we ask that you rule, Your Honor,

159
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:23,802
on paragraph 7 of article 255:

160
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:27,134
"A spouse may receive an advance

161
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:31,397
on the liquidation of marriage property
if necessary."

162
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:35,059
I'd like to know
if it's necessary or not.

163
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:39,313
One spouse worked full-time
and is now unemployed,

164
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:43,609
but it was her choice
to leave and come here.

165
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:47,450
Each time my client asked
to see his children,

166
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:50,412
he was told
they left for the weekend.

167
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:54,169
She claims she's broke,
just 900 a month,

168
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:58,253
yet takes weekend trips
and plans a big birthday party.

169
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:02,294
The situation
doesn't justify this advance.

170
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:05,840
- Did you provide a balance sheet?
- Yes, Your Honor.

171
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:07,132
All right.

172
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:26,618
Let's begin
with Josephine's medical certificate.

173
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:28,620
What happened?

174
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:31,581
She was in 9th grade.

175
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:35,286
He kept an eye on her,
wouldn't let her date.

176
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:38,751
He saw her kissing Samuel
at the Conservatory.

177
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:42,384
She plays piano since she's 6.
Samuel is her boyfriend.

178
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:46,547
That day she skipped school
to go see him.

179
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:48,840
He caught them by surprise.

180
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:53,683
He waited till she got home that night
and he hit her.

181
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:58,441
I was at work and he called,
threatening to break her hands...

182
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:01,903
if I didn't go straight home.
And so...

183
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,073
she was in pain, and...

184
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:07,863
The next day she saw the nurse

185
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:10,995
to tell her about the problems at home.

186
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,202
All right.

187
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:14,749
Sir?

188
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:18,874
She sprained her wrist at the gym.
What can I say?

189
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:22,086
Which of you is the bigger liar?

190
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:29,177
Look at the certificate, Your Honor.
3 years later.

191
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,591
"L, Stephanie Bossel,

192
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:36,104
"examined Josephine Besson
on October 12, 2013.

193
00:13:36,274 --> 00:13:40,518
"She had pain in the left wrist,
resulting in limited movement.

194
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:43,687
"Pressure on the scaphoid
and 5th metacarpal

195
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:47,358
"caused pain and a bruise
on the inside of the wrist.

196
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:50,243
"She mentioned problems
with her father.

197
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:53,496
"After discussion,
she decided not to use this note,

198
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,704
"written at her request
and sent by mail."

199
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:59,370
Mrs. Besson's former boss
also testified

200
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:02,790
that he often spied on her
at her workplace.

201
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:05,796
- Unbelievable!
- Please.

202
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:17,187
Your children have turned against you.
Can you explain?

203
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,143
No.

204
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:21,024
I'd like to understand.

205
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,564
I don't know what they're told.

206
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,344
We can see
Julien is not ready to see his father.

207
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:51,050
It's too stressful.

208
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:53,716
- You make things worse.
- Stop, Counselor.

209
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:57,602
You're the only person
losing your temper.

210
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:04,185
Mr. Besson bought Julien a phone

211
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:07,695
and yet he still has no contact.

212
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:09,105
Julien won't answer.

213
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:12,696
He tells Julien to put me on.
Julien stopped answering.

214
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,279
We just want peace.

215
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:19,324
I just want news of my kids.

216
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,877
Who just wants peace?

217
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:23,878
Excuse me?

218
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:26,247
"We just want peace."
Who's "we"?

219
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:29,547
Julien...

220
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:33,263
me, my daughter too.
Ask her, you'll see.

221
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:34,844
"Ask your daughter".

222
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:38,885
Your children seem to be on your side.
That's unfortunate.

223
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:43,018
Julien asked to give a statement

224
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:45,729
when he learned
his father was moving here.

225
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:48,565
I just want everything to go well.

226
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:50,605
I think of my kids' well-being.

227
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:52,486
May <i>I</i> Speak?

228
00:15:55,997 --> 00:15:57,078
Sir?

229
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,914
I think of his well-being too.

230
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:04,795
He needs supervision.
Taking away his father won't help.

231
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:21,223
Your lawyers will receive my decision
on May 29th.

232
00:16:21,856 --> 00:16:22,971
Goodbye.

233
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:31,946
Thank you.

234
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:41,369
Hearings like this are always grueling.

235
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:44,204
I'll call you once I have her decision.

236
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:47,621
I'm confident.
She understands how the children feel...

237
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:53,543
Antoine!

238
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,337
- So?
- What a jerk.

239
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:57,552
I'll be contacting you.
Goodbye.

240
00:16:58,559 --> 00:16:59,799
It went well.

241
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:01,183
Miriam!

242
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:05,059
For the kids.

243
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,309
It's up to the judge now.

244
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:11,194
- When will we know?
- A week.

245
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:28,586
- Go on. She'll kill you.
- I don't care.

246
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:52,151
- I'm <i>at</i> the Conservatory.
- I'm coming, Morn.

247
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:56,110
We got out early so I saw Samuel off.

248
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:59,822
<i>Stop lying.
Your teacher said you never came.</i>

249
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:04,330
<i>Fifth time in 2 months.
Each time Samuel comes.</i>

250
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,707
<i>Why do I pay for your classes?</i>

251
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:10,211
- I've had enough.
- / don't <i>trust</i> you anymore.

252
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:13,169
<i>We'll have a serious discussion,
believe me.</i>

253
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:37,484
It's over here.

254
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:43,786
Come in...

255
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,866
So, there are three bedrooms.

256
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:50,581
About 840 square feet.

257
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:54,748
This is the foyer.
A separate toilet there.

258
00:18:55,426 --> 00:18:59,169
In the foyer, the intercom,
an electricity meter.

259
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:00,963
Separate toilet.

260
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:05,008
Wardrobe, closet... and the living room.

261
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:39,801
This is my room.
I'll have a double bed.

262
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,426
You sleep together?

263
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:44,384
What the hell do you care?

264
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:50,603
Is it him?

265
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,306
SQ?

266
00:19:53,776 --> 00:19:55,767
- This is my room.
- Dream on!

267
00:19:55,945 --> 00:19:58,607
Samuel can't come over,
so why a big bed?

268
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:01,109
Just like that man.

269
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:03,028
Don't start up.

270
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:04,783
Auntie?

271
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:08,071
- Who's he?
- Cyril, a colleague at City Hall.

272
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:11,291
He found this apartment for you.

273
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:17,209
- What is it?
- I won't make it.

274
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:20,000
You'll see him soon.
At your birthday.

275
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:23,386
- She's so unfair.
- You need to concentrate.

276
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:25,763
I promised I'd stop skipping class.

277
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:27,223
Come on.

278
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:28,933
I don't see myself here.

279
00:20:29,103 --> 00:20:32,937
Come on, you'll fix up your room.
It'll be fine.

280
00:20:33,107 --> 00:20:34,017
Come.

281
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:36,148
You can go have a look.

282
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:40,316
You're only 1O minutes from downtown.

283
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:43,072
There's a bus station below...

284
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,232
Excuse me.

285
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:47,072
- It's available?
- First of the month.

286
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,281
Hello, Counselor.

287
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:50,287
- Excuse me.
- No problem.

288
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,081
Yes, Counselor?

289
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:05,628
Really?

290
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:08,889
Why?

291
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:37,121
<i>Miriam?</i>

292
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:41,964
- What's <i>going</i> on?
- He doesn't feel well. He can't come.

293
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,542
<i>Come out to talk.</i>

294
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,838
- <i>He has</i> a <i>stomach ache.</i>
- I'll <i>take him to the doctor.</i>

295
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:50,552
- But...
<i>- Come give me the address.</i>

296
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:53,055
I don't want trouble.

297
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:55,687
<i>No trouble.
The judge ruled, period.</i>

298
00:21:57,608 --> 00:21:59,565
Antoine, he's really sick.

299
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:01,601
<i>Come out and we'll talk.</i>

300
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:05,105
No, I won't come out.

301
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:09,989
<i>I have him this weekend.
If he doesn't come...</i>

302
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:12,028
I'll <i>file</i> a <i>complaint.</i>

303
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:14,906
<i>Am I being clear?</i>

304
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:22,672
What did he say?

305
00:22:46,574 --> 00:22:48,110
<i>Bye-bye, JUN-.</i>

306
00:23:21,442 --> 00:23:22,807
Hello, sweetie.

307
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:27,520
Hello.

308
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:50,755
So I hear you're sick?

309
00:23:54,308 --> 00:23:56,390
Your mom said you were sick.

310
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:00,348
Do you have any medicine?

311
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:08,894
Talk to me.

312
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:40,388
Put on your seatbelt.

313
00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:51,188
- You're a growing boy!
- You barely ate.

314
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:54,152
We're going hunting early.

315
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:57,993
No, next time.
He's not feeling well.

316
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:00,780
Then there's no use insisting.

317
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:03,332
Bring us our coffee.

318
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:06,293
Blandine asked about her wedding again.

319
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:08,295
- When is it?
- Next Saturday.

320
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:11,708
I don't have Juju.
I can't drive another 600 miles.

321
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:13,671
Answer her.
So she can plan.

322
00:25:16,265 --> 00:25:17,972
We can switch weekends.

323
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:19,469
You see?

324
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:22,306
She'd love to see you two.

325
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:25,103
I made a surprise for you.

326
00:25:27,568 --> 00:25:28,399
Dad?

327
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:30,602
Let's switch weekends.

328
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:37,366
I'd like to go to Josephine's party
the weekend after.

329
00:25:41,582 --> 00:25:42,868
You want to?

330
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:32,439
We have an hour.

331
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:38,646
Because I picked you up an hour late.

332
00:28:07,436 --> 00:28:09,177
Who calls me "that man"?

333
00:28:17,154 --> 00:28:18,394
Me.

334
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:23,657
Does your mother say it too?

335
00:28:26,914 --> 00:28:28,370
No, just me.

336
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:32,787
And your sister?

337
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:47,389
Want to go to her party?

338
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:59,227
Why is your mother using you to ask me?

339
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,024
She can't ask me?

340
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:06,150
With a normal mom,
we can discuss things, don't you think?

341
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,447
She should ask.
Why doesn't she?

342
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:16,327
She has no cell phone.

343
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:29,681
Give me your notebook.

344
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,228
Give it to me.

345
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:39,107
Her number doesn't work.

346
00:29:40,237 --> 00:29:42,069
Give me your notebook.

347
00:29:47,661 --> 00:29:49,698
Julien, your notebook.

348
00:30:25,282 --> 00:30:26,818
- <i>Hello?
-</i> It's <i>that man.</i>

349
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:31,493
<i>- Is Julien with you?
- Yeah, he's here.</i>

350
00:30:32,289 --> 00:30:35,782
He asked to switch weekends
so he can go to the party

351
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:37,495
in two weeks.

352
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:40,377
<i>- Where did you get my number?
- Answer me.</i>

353
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:43,964
<i>It would be nice if he could go.</i>

354
00:30:44,134 --> 00:30:47,468
Don't you think
you should ask me yourself?

355
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:50,299
- Listen...
- It's not that hard.

356
00:30:51,308 --> 00:30:53,891
<i>Can we switch weekends
so he can go?</i>

357
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:55,259
Please.

358
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:57,556
<i>Please.</i>

359
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:01,398
I'm on my way. We'll discuss it.

360
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:02,242
Hey, Juju. How are you?

361
00:32:04,673 --> 00:32:07,085
- He won't switch weekends.
- He said so?

362
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:09,170
- Because of his job.
- Fuck!

363
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:10,175
Asshole!

364
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:11,418
Why is he still there?

365
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:13,883
- Relax!
- Must I go outside?

366
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:17,015
I forgot my bag. I'll go get it.

367
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:32,322
She's not home.

368
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:48,580
<i>You've reached 061487...</i>

369
00:32:53,472 --> 00:32:55,554
Didn't I say she's not normal?

370
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:59,342
- She's not home.
- Where is she?

371
00:33:00,312 --> 00:33:02,223
Can I get my bag?
I forgot it.

372
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:07,524
You won't go to the party thanks to her.

373
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:08,896
You'll be with me.

374
00:33:39,309 --> 00:33:41,721
<i>Tell me once you've done it.</i>

375
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:47,097
<i>Okay. I love you.</i>

376
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:25,806
<i>Erase contact "Mom"?</i>

377
00:37:14,858 --> 00:37:16,644
Hey sweetie, how are you?

378
00:37:20,113 --> 00:37:22,150
Can you get your mother, please?

379
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:24,155
Julien?

380
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:38,837
I'll let you go to the party tonight.

381
00:37:39,716 --> 00:37:43,209
She needs to tell me
when to drop you off.

382
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:46,048
She's not home.

383
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:49,513
Yes, she is.

384
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:51,637
She's not home!

385
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:05,113
Then where is she?

386
00:38:11,748 --> 00:38:13,034
Where is she?

387
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:17,910
Where is she?

388
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,620
UP your ass!

389
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:56,490
- Can you help?
- I'm going to drop my bags.

390
00:38:57,502 --> 00:38:58,958
Hello, my boy.

391
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:10,633
- How long are you leaving this?
- Until I get the keys.

392
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:14,432
Your mother made you rabbit.

393
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,726
So where is your apartment?

394
00:39:25,655 --> 00:39:28,568
10 minutes from the new hospital.
It's nice.

395
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:30,982
A balcony, a room for Julien.

396
00:39:32,412 --> 00:39:34,323
When does the hospital open?

397
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:39,366
I already told you. September.
And I'll start then.

398
00:39:41,421 --> 00:39:43,503
Will you still come visit?

399
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:58,594
The Dutrieuxs say hi.
We saw them at the wedding.

400
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:01,850
Are they doing okay?

401
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:06,109
We saw Laetitia too. My God...

402
00:40:08,698 --> 00:40:11,110
She won't find a guy like that.

403
00:40:11,284 --> 00:40:14,697
Last time we saw her
was two years ago.

404
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:18,534
Regis' birthday party.

405
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:21,245
God knows how much she weighs.

406
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,081
She let herself go.

407
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,167
She doesn't have an easy life.

408
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:28,582
She lives all alone.

409
00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:32,010
- No excuse.
- Works nights.

410
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:35,639
When she gets home,
it must be... 7am.

411
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:39,930
She said she saw you.

412
00:40:40,063 --> 00:40:43,021
On her way home, with Josephine.

413
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:45,940
- Where does she live?
- The projects.

414
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:47,900
Why were you there?

415
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:49,477
Remember Laetitia?

416
00:40:52,033 --> 00:40:53,239
It wasn't us.

417
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:55,650
You got in a bus.

418
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:57,326
Why were you there?

419
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:02,039
- What were you doing?
- No big deal.

420
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:03,908
Why where you there?

421
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:07,461
To see Josephine's friend.

422
00:41:08,383 --> 00:41:10,670
But you got in a bus.

423
00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:13,794
We were leaving her place.

424
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:15,258
To go where?

425
00:41:15,807 --> 00:41:18,344
- Stop, Antoine.
- To go where?

426
00:41:18,518 --> 00:41:19,633
SchooL

427
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:21,802
- Stop, Antoine.
- Shut up.

428
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:24,722
You saw her friend before school?

429
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:26,981
Answer me!

430
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:28,691
Stop it!

431
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:33,442
You always have to fuck things up!

432
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:36,483
Stupid idiot! You spoil everything!

433
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:40,404
It could have been nice.
You make it impossible!

434
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:43,243
Why must this happen each time?

435
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:47,833
It's no surprise
that your kids won't see you!

436
00:41:48,131 --> 00:41:49,713
What'll you do now?

437
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:56,758
- What are you doing?
- Get your stuff.

438
00:41:58,391 --> 00:42:01,600
Don't you ever set foot here again!

439
00:42:02,979 --> 00:42:04,014
Julien!

440
00:42:52,904 --> 00:42:54,360
Are you happy now?

441
00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:05,329
Do you think I'm a fool?

442
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:15,131
You live in the projects?

443
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:17,462
No.

444
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:30,473
You're as big a liar as your mom.

445
00:43:31,943 --> 00:43:34,401
You're no dumber than before, are you?

446
00:43:36,364 --> 00:43:38,230
Look at me when I talk.

447
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:41,483
Is it her boyfriend's place?

448
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:50,663
She's holding a bomb
that'll blow up in her face.

449
00:43:53,256 --> 00:43:55,839
She's not allowed to do any of this!

450
00:43:56,008 --> 00:43:57,419
Understand?

451
00:43:58,594 --> 00:44:02,758
She'll pay for it big-time
if she keeps playing me for a fool!

452
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:06,299
I'm your father!
I need to know where you live!

453
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:10,808
Look at me when I talk!
Look at me!

454
00:44:15,695 --> 00:44:17,060
Where is it?

455
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:22,148
Straight ahead.

456
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:44,303
And now?

457
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:46,130
Straight.

458
00:44:53,274 --> 00:44:54,639
Left.

459
00:45:01,157 --> 00:45:02,739
What floor are you on?

460
00:45:04,076 --> 00:45:05,407
Second.

461
00:45:11,918 --> 00:45:13,124
Right.

462
00:45:17,048 --> 00:45:18,254
Left.

463
00:45:25,598 --> 00:45:26,929
Right.

464
00:45:34,357 --> 00:45:36,018
It's her boyfriend's place?

465
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:38,983
She has no boyfriend.

466
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:52,329
Over there.

467
00:45:54,126 --> 00:45:56,208
That one? There?

468
00:45:59,257 --> 00:46:00,088
This one?

469
00:46:05,888 --> 00:46:07,219
Give rne your keys.

470
00:46:09,934 --> 00:46:11,470
Give rne your keys.

471
00:46:31,706 --> 00:46:33,288
Come with me.

472
00:46:34,375 --> 00:46:36,241
Leave your bags. Come.

473
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:55,889
<i>Entrance refused.</i>

474
00:46:56,147 --> 00:46:56,978
Wait!

475
00:46:58,441 --> 00:46:59,397
Stop!

476
00:47:05,281 --> 00:47:06,396
Stop!

477
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:37,987
Come on.

478
00:48:40,376 --> 00:48:41,832
I'm driving you back.

479
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:47,672
Sweetie, I don't want trouble
every weekend.

480
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,000
Get in!

481
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:55,175
Come on, get in.

482
00:48:56,517 --> 00:48:57,632
Where are we going?

483
00:48:57,810 --> 00:49:01,223
Didn't you want to go
to your sister's party?

484
00:49:38,851 --> 00:49:40,512
Can I have my keys?

485
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:21,682
Can I have my keys?

486
00:50:54,218 --> 00:50:56,050
I just called Laetitia.

487
00:50:58,055 --> 00:51:00,296
She said she saw you here.

488
00:51:01,767 --> 00:51:03,758
I don't want you to hit Mom.

489
00:51:12,236 --> 00:51:14,102
I'll find it by myself.

490
00:51:29,962 --> 00:51:31,498
What floor are you on?

491
00:51:32,965 --> 00:51:34,080
Eighth.

492
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:41,970
Hello, ma'am.

493
00:52:35,778 --> 00:52:37,439
I'm not interrupting?

494
00:53:25,661 --> 00:53:27,243
What do you want?

495
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:32,198
To see where my kids live.

496
00:53:39,299 --> 00:53:40,789
I have to go now.

497
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:22,878
- Where's my daughter?
- At the reception hall.

498
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:41,039
I've changed.

499
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:10,364
I've changed.

500
00:57:00,208 --> 00:57:01,698
I have to go.

501
00:57:30,906 --> 00:57:32,567
I'll pick him up tomorrow.

502
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:35,403
No problem.

503
00:57:50,175 --> 00:57:52,212
What time should I come?

504
00:57:52,803 --> 00:57:54,919
We're sleeping at my parents'.

505
00:57:57,349 --> 00:57:58,714
11 o'clock?

506
00:57:59,518 --> 00:58:00,633
All right.

507
00:58:27,587 --> 00:58:29,294
Don't say he came.

508
00:58:29,673 --> 00:58:31,755
Say I bumped into you in town.

509
00:58:54,239 --> 00:58:57,277
- What's that?
- You don't make the law here.

510
00:59:12,049 --> 00:59:13,380
Where's Julien?

511
00:59:18,430 --> 00:59:21,388
At his mom's.
I'll pick him up tomorrow.

512
00:59:23,268 --> 00:59:24,758
Staying for dinner?

513
00:59:31,985 --> 00:59:33,942
It seems I'm not welcome.

514
00:59:41,453 --> 00:59:42,534
Do as you please.

515
01:00:15,529 --> 01:00:17,941
What did you and Josephine decide?

516
01:00:19,366 --> 01:00:21,903
A song before or after the cake?

517
01:00:22,077 --> 01:00:23,238
After.

518
01:00:23,703 --> 01:00:25,285
Can we serve it now?

519
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:27,287
She wants to wait for Manon.

520
01:00:28,667 --> 01:00:30,032
Where's Manon?

521
01:00:30,544 --> 01:00:33,502
She'll call
when she gets off the highway.

522
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:38,169
You can't drive 300 miles tonight.

523
01:00:38,468 --> 01:00:40,209
It's fine. I can drive.

524
01:00:40,387 --> 01:00:42,424
You can stay at Nana's.

525
01:00:42,597 --> 01:00:45,589
Don't worry. It's kind of you.

526
01:00:45,767 --> 01:00:48,054
I prefer to drive. I planned on it.

527
01:00:52,816 --> 01:00:55,103
You two can see each other,

528
01:00:55,277 --> 01:00:57,188
but she can't skip classes.

529
01:00:57,571 --> 01:00:59,778
She has to graduate.

530
01:01:00,407 --> 01:01:01,613
You understand?

531
01:01:02,242 --> 01:01:03,698
Yes, of course.

532
01:01:05,787 --> 01:01:07,243
So we'll wait for Manon.

533
01:04:25,987 --> 01:04:27,648
What are you doing, Miriam?

534
01:04:27,822 --> 01:04:29,358
Have you seen Julien?

535
01:04:29,532 --> 01:04:31,273
He must be inside.

536
01:05:45,066 --> 01:05:47,683
Come on,
Josephine is going to sing!

537
01:07:39,389 --> 01:07:41,881
Why are you here?
My dad mustn't see you.

538
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:44,140
I have a gift for Josephine.

539
01:07:44,894 --> 01:07:46,635
I'll give it to her.

540
01:07:46,813 --> 01:07:48,724
I left it in my car.

541
01:07:49,732 --> 01:07:52,770
Give it to her tomorrow
when you get Julien?

542
01:07:53,570 --> 01:07:56,483
Isn't it humiliating enough
for me to be here?

543
01:09:10,730 --> 01:09:12,220
What am I?

544
01:09:15,818 --> 01:09:17,559
What's that stare?

545
01:09:20,031 --> 01:09:21,567
What am I to you?

546
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:24,065
I can't reach you.

547
01:09:24,243 --> 01:09:27,281
You change numbers.
You run away from me.

548
01:09:28,039 --> 01:09:29,780
Who am I for you?

549
01:09:29,957 --> 01:09:32,665
I won't talk about the same old stuff...

550
01:09:32,835 --> 01:09:35,372
You will, because we had two kids!

551
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:39,168
When you vanish, you hurt me.
You know it.

552
01:09:40,885 --> 01:09:42,046
You need help.

553
01:09:42,261 --> 01:09:45,344
The nerve of you!
You're the one who needs help!

554
01:09:47,475 --> 01:09:48,306
Coming!

555
01:09:48,643 --> 01:09:49,804
Who's he?

556
01:09:51,270 --> 01:09:52,760
My sister's friend.
I'm coming.

557
01:09:53,189 --> 01:09:55,271
Why is he at my daughter's party?

558
01:09:55,441 --> 01:09:57,182
I'll deal with the cake.

559
01:09:58,403 --> 01:10:00,519
Cyril... Nice to meet you.

560
01:10:01,531 --> 01:10:03,363
I'm talking to my wife.

561
01:10:06,494 --> 01:10:08,952
- Have a nice evening.
- I'm coming.

562
01:10:47,535 --> 01:10:49,697
Give me Josephine's present.

563
01:10:52,373 --> 01:10:54,114
You're such a tease.

564
01:10:55,084 --> 01:10:56,074
Let go of me!

565
01:10:56,252 --> 01:10:57,117
Who is he?

566
01:10:57,628 --> 01:10:59,210
- Who is he?
- Stop it.

567
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:01,246
Have you fucked him?

568
01:11:01,424 --> 01:11:02,835
- Stop.
- Tell me.

569
01:11:03,009 --> 01:11:03,919
Let go of her!

570
01:11:06,429 --> 01:11:07,965
We're just talking.

571
01:11:09,140 --> 01:11:11,131
Leave her alone! Fuck off!

572
01:11:11,309 --> 01:11:12,799
I'm very calm.

573
01:11:13,186 --> 01:11:14,551
Beat it, prick.

574
01:11:14,729 --> 01:11:17,266
Touch her again and I'll kill you!

575
01:11:19,901 --> 01:11:22,142
- Kiss the kids for me.
- Fuck off!

576
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:23,856
I'm not talking to you.

577
01:11:24,030 --> 01:11:26,613
Fuck off
or I'll call the cops, asshole!

578
01:11:38,669 --> 01:11:40,080
What a loser.

579
01:11:46,969 --> 01:11:50,303
- The prick left. He hit you.
- I'm fine.

580
01:11:50,473 --> 01:11:52,089
- File a complaint.
- What for?

581
01:11:52,266 --> 01:11:55,054
I'll come with you.
This has to end.

582
01:11:55,228 --> 01:11:56,639
Come on...

583
01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:03,266
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

584
01:12:12,578 --> 01:12:15,036
Maybe I shouldn't come over tonight.

585
01:12:16,791 --> 01:12:19,658
Hi, ma'am.
What a pain to find this place.

586
01:12:20,211 --> 01:12:22,703
- Hey, Manon. Hungry?
- Starving.

587
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:24,791
There's plenty to eat.

588
01:12:27,051 --> 01:12:28,667
It's up to you.

589
01:13:11,470 --> 01:13:12,505
My granddaughter!

590
01:13:17,977 --> 01:13:19,888
What is it now?

591
01:13:20,062 --> 01:13:21,848
I just don't want to.

592
01:13:22,940 --> 01:13:24,977
Let's say goodbye to your sister.

593
01:13:27,945 --> 01:13:29,276
See you tomorrow.

594
01:13:31,824 --> 01:13:34,031
- Can I drop you off?
- Cyril will.

595
01:13:34,201 --> 01:13:36,909
Julien's staying with you?
Pick you up at 10.

596
01:13:37,079 --> 01:13:38,240
You'll be okay?

597
01:13:38,414 --> 01:13:39,654
Goodnight.

598
01:13:42,335 --> 01:13:45,373
- He's not coming to Nana's?
- Not anymore.

599
01:13:45,671 --> 01:13:48,003
Go to sleep. I'll clean up tomorrow.

600
01:13:48,174 --> 01:13:51,963
I'll just straighten up the equipment,
the cables...

601
01:13:52,136 --> 01:13:54,924
- Don't keep Papy up.
- We have a key.

602
01:13:55,097 --> 01:13:56,883
Sleep well, kids.

603
01:13:57,183 --> 01:13:58,514
Goodnight, Mom.

604
01:13:59,060 --> 01:14:00,095
Goodnight.

605
01:14:00,978 --> 01:14:02,139
See you tomorrow.

606
01:16:20,326 --> 01:16:22,567
- Is it him?
- What do you think?

607
01:17:04,745 --> 01:17:07,954
- Go to sleep.
- Can I sleep with you?

608
01:17:08,124 --> 01:17:09,285
Come.

609
01:17:50,833 --> 01:17:54,121
When he gets fed up, he'll leave.

610
01:18:39,757 --> 01:18:41,339
Did he leave?

611
01:18:43,219 --> 01:18:44,584
I think so.

612
01:20:28,532 --> 01:20:29,613
Mom...

613
01:21:12,701 --> 01:21:14,692
Our conversation isn't over.

614
01:21:26,799 --> 01:21:28,130
Open up!

615
01:21:33,514 --> 01:21:34,345
Open!

616
01:21:35,891 --> 01:21:37,256
Open the door!

617
01:21:39,895 --> 01:21:44,059
<i>B-O-U-H-A-D-D-L.</i>

618
01:21:44,233 --> 01:21:46,600
<i>- Bouhadch.
- We're on the way.</i>

619
01:21:50,030 --> 01:21:52,897
TN-821 for 71...

620
01:21:56,286 --> 01:21:57,117
<i>Yes?</i>

621
01:21:57,246 --> 01:21:59,863
Saint-Dumont, 9 rue Winston Churchill.

622
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:02,202
I repeat: Saint-Dumont,

623
01:22:02,376 --> 01:22:04,242
9 rue Winston Churchill.

624
01:22:04,545 --> 01:22:07,082
Someone is forcing open a door.

625
01:22:07,256 --> 01:22:10,294
The neighbor says he has a large weapon,

626
01:22:10,467 --> 01:22:12,128
like a hunting rifle.

627
01:22:12,302 --> 01:22:16,091
It's taking place on the 8th floor.

628
01:22:16,849 --> 01:22:19,637
Use the intercom to enter the building.

629
01:22:19,810 --> 01:22:22,268
The name is "Bouhaddi".

630
01:22:22,438 --> 01:22:25,180
Bravo-Oscar-Uniform...

631
01:22:25,357 --> 01:22:26,438
Dad, stop!

632
01:22:26,608 --> 01:22:29,191
Antoine, please stop!

633
01:22:29,945 --> 01:22:31,902
- Open up!
- Antoine, stop!

634
01:22:38,871 --> 01:22:41,033
Mommy, I can't hear anything!

635
01:22:48,505 --> 01:22:50,542
I can't hear anything, Mommy!

636
01:22:55,345 --> 01:22:57,632
<i>- What's the emergency?
- He fired'.!</i>

637
01:22:57,806 --> 01:22:59,342
What's the address?

638
01:23:00,309 --> 01:23:01,799
<i>He'll Kill us!</i>

639
01:23:01,977 --> 01:23:03,559
Where are you?

640
01:23:04,229 --> 01:23:05,594
<i>He shot at the door!</i>

641
01:23:05,772 --> 01:23:08,230
I need your address. What address?

642
01:23:08,567 --> 01:23:10,899
- Antoine, stop!
- Open up!

643
01:23:12,154 --> 01:23:13,440
<i>I need your address.</i>

644
01:23:13,614 --> 01:23:16,231
9 rue Winston Churchill.

645
01:23:16,408 --> 01:23:17,648
<i>A car is coming.</i>

646
01:23:17,826 --> 01:23:19,658
Do you know who fired?

647
01:23:19,828 --> 01:23:20,989
My husband.

648
01:23:21,580 --> 01:23:23,992
<i>- You're not alone?
- With my son.</i>

649
01:23:31,590 --> 01:23:32,580
Antoine, stop!

650
01:23:34,968 --> 01:23:35,833
Keep calm.

651
01:23:36,011 --> 01:23:38,093
Do you have a room that locks?

652
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:39,511
<i>Yes.</i>

653
01:23:39,640 --> 01:23:41,722
Go lock yourselves inside.

654
01:23:41,892 --> 01:23:43,098
Open up!

655
01:23:45,687 --> 01:23:47,473
<i>Help is on the way.</i>

656
01:23:55,697 --> 01:23:56,937
<i>Where are you?</i>

657
01:23:57,115 --> 01:23:58,526
In the bathroom.

658
01:23:58,700 --> 01:24:00,190
Did you lock the door?

659
01:24:01,828 --> 01:24:04,320
Can you block the door?

660
01:24:26,770 --> 01:24:27,726
He's inside.

661
01:24:27,896 --> 01:24:29,728
Listen to me, ma'am.

662
01:24:29,898 --> 01:24:31,639
Do you have a bathtub?

663
01:24:32,609 --> 01:24:34,566
Lie down in it with your son.

664
01:24:34,736 --> 01:24:35,771
Take cover.

665
01:24:35,946 --> 01:24:38,313
Get inside. Hurry up...

666
01:24:39,950 --> 01:24:41,406
Get down.

667
01:24:42,286 --> 01:24:43,492
More, more.

668
01:24:47,165 --> 01:24:48,655
<i>Stay on the phone.</i>

669
01:24:48,834 --> 01:24:50,745
<i>You're not alone. I'm with you.</i>

670
01:24:59,177 --> 01:25:01,134
I'm with you. Don't worry.

671
01:25:01,305 --> 01:25:02,340
A car is coming.

672
01:25:02,931 --> 01:25:05,343
<i>Just a few seconds. It's almost over.</i>

673
01:25:18,739 --> 01:25:21,447
<i>Stay in the tub. Don't come out.</i>

674
01:25:50,062 --> 01:25:51,052
Open up.

675
01:26:02,157 --> 01:26:03,943
Police! Drop your weapon!

676
01:26:07,913 --> 01:26:10,655
<i>Stay put. The police are there.</i>

677
01:26:11,416 --> 01:26:14,374
<i>You're in a safe place.
Don't move, okay?</i>

678
01:26:15,212 --> 01:26:17,670
You're under arrest. Calm down!

679
01:26:17,839 --> 01:26:18,874
Don't move!

680
01:26:19,633 --> 01:26:20,873
<i>It's over, ma'am.</i>

681
01:26:24,304 --> 01:26:25,965
<i>Stay on the phone with me.</i>

682
01:26:28,850 --> 01:26:30,966
She's my wife!

683
01:26:31,269 --> 01:26:33,306
Don't let them do this to me!

684
01:26:36,942 --> 01:26:38,774
Get him out of here!

685
01:26:53,375 --> 01:26:54,911
It's over, ma'am.

686
01:26:57,546 --> 01:26:58,536
<i>Hear me?</i>

687
01:27:00,090 --> 01:27:01,421
It's over.

688
01:27:04,344 --> 01:27:05,709
It's over.

689
01:27:07,055 --> 01:27:10,173
<i>I'll hang up.
The officer will take care of you.</i>

690
01:27:10,851 --> 01:27:11,807
<i>All right?</i>

691
01:27:40,297 --> 01:27:42,083
Ma'am, can you hear me?

692
01:27:46,595 --> 01:27:48,586
Ma'am, can you hear me?

693
01:27:56,938 --> 01:27:58,849
Can you please open the door?

694
01:28:10,494 --> 01:28:12,576
It's over. You can come out.

695
01:28:39,981 --> 01:28:42,313
Are you okay? Are you wounded?

696
01:28:42,484 --> 01:28:44,725
Call an ambulance. Come...

697
01:29:19,980 --> 01:29:23,348
We've secured the premises.
Two victims.

698
01:29:23,692 --> 01:29:25,148
One is wounded.

699
01:29:25,318 --> 01:29:27,685
Send us an ambulance. Thanks.
