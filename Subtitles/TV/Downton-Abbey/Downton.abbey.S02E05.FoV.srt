00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,640
Am I ready?
Only you can answer that, sir.

3
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,200
They're going to chuck everything
they've got at us.

4
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,760
Then we shall have to chuck it back,
won't we, sir?

5
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,080
Quite right.

6
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,200
Now, there's no point in pretending
that this is going to be easy.

7
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,720
How are you, Thompson?
Have you shaken that cold?

8
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,760
I'm all right, sir, thank you.
Good man.

9
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:27,680
We're nearly there, chaps.
Just hold fast. It won't be long now.

10
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,320
We're with you, sir.
I know you are, Wakefield.

11
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,360
I can't tell you how much lighter
that makes the task.

Daisy, whatever's the matter
with you?

17
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,160
Someone walked over my grave.

18
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,400
Agh!

19
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,840

I'm so sorry.

22
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:42,880
What happened? I don't know.
I suddenly felt terribly cold.

23
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,560
Move! I won't be sorry
when this one's over.

24
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,040

00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,360
M'lady... M'lady, wake up.

27
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,720
What on earth-
You'd better come downstairs.

28
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,200
I didn't know what else to do
when I saw the telegram.

29
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,040
I knew it was urgent.

30
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,360
So...I hope it was right.

31
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,320
Quite right. Mrs Crawley
won't mind my opening it.

32
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,480
The main thing is he's not dead.

33
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,400
Not yet, anyway.
They've patched him up.

34
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,880
They're bringing him to the hospital
in Downton.

35
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,200
When do they think he'll get here?
It doesn't say.

36
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,600
How do we contact Isobel?
How will she get back?

37
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,320
One thing at a time. I'll ring
the War Office in the morning.

38
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,360
Maybe they know she's out there.
Perhaps she's with him now.

39
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,160
They wouldn't have sent a telegram
here and she'd have rung.

40
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,720
No, it's the usual balls- Usual
mess-up, I'm afraid. (CLEARS THROAT)

41
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:08,680
Beg pardon, m'lord, but we're all
very anxious to know the news.

42
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,720
Yes, of course.

43
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:20,120
It appears that a few days ago,
Captain Crawley was wounded.

44
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,120
It's serious, I'm afraid,
but he's alive

45
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,600
and on his way home
to the hospital in the village.

46
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,360
Where there's life, there's hope.

47
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,200
What about William? Is he all right?

48
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,920
I'll find out what I can tomorrow.

49
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,360
I'm not sure there's much more
we can do tonight.

50
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,600
William's father would have had a
telegram if anything had happened.

51
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,800
I'll drive over in the morning.

52
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,120
Whatever you discover...tell me.

53
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,200
Don't keep anything back.

54
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,040
Lady Edith's back.

55
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,680
William was caught in it.

56
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,440
He's gone to some hospital in Leeds.

57
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,320
I'm very sorry.

58
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,080
I might have known. We couldn't be
the only household left untouched.

59
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,400
Will he come through it?
Her ladyship said it sounded bad.

60
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,560
But we don't know more than that.

61
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,320
Can you walk with me to the church
this afternoon? If you want me to.

62
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,720
Because I'd like to say a prayer
for them. For both of them.

63
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,320
We only cater for officers.

64
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,240
Dr Clarkson...I am no Jacobin
revolutionary,

65
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,160
nor do I seek to overthrow
the civilised world.

66
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:03,440
We just need one bed for a young man
from this village!

67
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,840
And if it were within my power,
you should have it.

68
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,920
Sir, you don't understand.

69
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,760
William's father can not afford
to leave his farm and move to Leeds.

70
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,920
I'm very sorry. Really.
But this is a military hospital

71
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,960
and it's not up to me
to challenge the order of things...

72
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,120
I'll nurse him. I'm happy to do it.
It wouldn't add to your workload.

73
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,440
If I were to break the rule for you,
how many others do you think

74
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,800
would come forward
to plead for their sons?

75
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,440
The answer is and must be "no".

76
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,640
It always happens when you give
these little people power.

77
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,240
It goes to their heads
like strong drink.

78
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,240
I'm sorry for him. I am.

79
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:48,400
I don't mind Captain Crawley.
He's a better man than most of them.

80
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:51,960
And William too. He's not a bad lad,
whatever you say.

81
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,440
I wish I'd not written that letter
to Bates' wife,

82
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,160
telling her he's back here.

83
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,440
What's that got to do with it?
What with everything else going on,

84
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,760
I know she'll come up here
and make trouble.

85
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,760
Don't blame me, it wasn't my idea.

86
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:11,320
Any news? Only that the doctor won't
let William come to the village.

87
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,200
He never?!
It's for officers only, he says.

88
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,440
And his poor father staying there
with him,

89
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:19,760
spending money he's not got
and travelling miles to do it.

90
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,200
It's not right.
No, it bloody well isn't.

91
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,840
Well, I'm a working class lad
and so is he.

92
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:31,480
And I get fed up seeing how our lot
always get shafted.

93
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,560
I thought I'd take some things
down to the hospital.

94
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,240
Then I can wait and sit with him
when he arrives.

95
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,920
I've read somewhere that it's very
important not to leave them alone

96
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,880
when they're first wounded,
so no sign goes unnoticed.

97
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,160
They can't spare a nurse to watch
over every man,

98
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,000
so that's what I can do.

99
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,640
Your mother's written to Lavinia.

100
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,800
Good. Yes.

101
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,880
I'm glad someone's thought of that.

102
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,840
She must stay here and not be
at Isobel's by herself.

103
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,600
What?

104
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,760
Nothing.

105
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,480
You should have had
a church wedding.

106
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,520
Don't be silly.

107
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,560
No, I mean it.

108
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:23,040
You in a white dress,
me looking like a fool.

109
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,320
I'd rather have the right man
than the right wedding.

110
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,640
Well, it won't be long now.

111
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
How long?

112
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,680
Hard to say. But don't worry.

113
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,000
The decree nisi means we're safe.

114
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,640
The decree absolute's only
a formality.

115
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,400
I'm just sorry it cost so much.

116
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,880
She could've had my shoes
and the shirt off my back,

117
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,960
if it would only make her go away
for good.

118
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,040
She's gone now.

119
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,720
I suppose I could feel guilty in my
happiness...

120
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,520
knowing the troubles they're all
facing back at home.

121
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,200
But in another way,
it only makes me more grateful.

122
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:19,240
Let's pray. Let's pray together.

123
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,160
Don't worry.
The old lady'll sort something out

124
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,280
now she's got the bit between
her teeth.

125
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:43,000
I'm not worried. Not in that way.
I feel sorry for William, that's all.

126
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,040
Well, of course you do. We all do.

127
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:48,360
I expect you're glad now that you
let him have his little daydream.

128
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,280
No, I'm not glad.

129
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:54,400
I feel I've led him up the
garden path with all that nonsense,

130
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,440
and I'm ashamed.

131
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,920
I'm so ashamed.

132
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,880
Oh!

133
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,040
Shh!

134
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,360
Hello?

135
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,360
Mrs Bates, isn't it?
What do you want?

136
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,760
Don't sound inhospitable,
Mrs Patmore.

137
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,720
When I've only ever known a welcome
in this house.

138
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,640
Yes, yes...the Minister!

139
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:26,480
Well, how many Marquesses
of Flintshire are there?

140
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,720
Yes, oh!

141
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,880
Is this an instrument of
communication or torture?

142
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,000
What... Hello?

143
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,760
Shrimpie?
Yes, it's Aunt Violet.

144
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,600
Yes, very well, very...

145
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,720
Ye... And Susan?

146
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,360
Ye... Oh, good.

147
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,080
Good, I won't beat about the bush,
dear.

148
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:57,560
Whom might we know on the board
of Leeds General infirmary?

149
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,000
Excuse me, it is not settled.
It wasn't settled by me

150
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,040
that you'd come back here
and take up with your floozy again.

151
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,200
As far as I recall,
that was never settled.

152
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,920
How did you find out he was here?
Wouldn't you like to know?

153
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,720
What does it matter?
Just say what you want. Spit it out.

154
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,800
You thought you'd got the better of
me. But you were wrong. I never...

155
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,640
I'm going to sell my story, anyway,

156
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,920
about Lady Mary, about the Turkish
gentleman, about Miss Smith, here...

157
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,760
It's got nowt to do with me.
Well, that's not what I heard.

158
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,920
You gave your word. I gave you the
money and you gave me your word.

159
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:29,240
Well, guess what? I was lying.

160
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:32,160
If I hadn't come back to Downton,
back to Anna,

161
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,640
would you have stuck
to our agreement?

162
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,640
Well, we'll never know now, will we?

163
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,440
You're angry because I'm happy.

164
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,480
Maybe.

165
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,520
But you won't be happy long.

166
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,800
(DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES)

167
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,960
Can you drive me to the hospital?

168
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,800
Aren't you needed here?
I've already taken Lady Mary down.

169
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:06,280
I know. I want to be with her
when Captain Crawley arrives.

170
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,920
They can manage without me here
for a while.

171
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:12,400
Is she still in love with him?
I don't want to talk about it.

172
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,720
Why? Because I'm the chauffeur?

173
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,840
No, because she's my sister.

174
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,840
You're good at hiding your feelings,
aren't you? All of you.

175
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,320
Much better than we are.

176
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,560
Perhaps. But we do have feelings.

177
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,520
And don't make the mistake
of thinking we don't.

178
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:44,760
And has Lord Flintshire's order
been acted on?

179
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,880
It has.
There's an ambulance waiting,

180
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,560
although no-one quite knows
how you managed it.

181
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,360
What exactly is the matter with him?

182
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,600
His body sustained too much damage.
He cannot recover.

183
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:00,360
But he looks so normal.

184
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,600
Appearances can be cruelly
deceptive.

185
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:05,440
The force of the blast has
fatally injured his lungs.

186
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,280
But if he's lived this long?

187
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,840
Would it make any difference
if he stayed here

188
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,680
or are you just making him
as comfortable as can be?

189
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,280
That's it. There's nothing more
we can do for him.

190
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,520
So you agree with our plan?

191
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,240
I don't know about you,

192
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:22,720
but I'd rather die in a familiar
place, surrounded by familiar faces.

193
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,240
There you are, Mr Mason.

194
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:30,200
Seems we have everything settled,
and we'll be away before long.

195
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,160
He'll be forced to do better,

196
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,400
if we can just get him back to where
he knows. I feel sure of it.

197
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,280
I shouldn't...

198
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:41,960
I shouldn't worry too much. We'll
know much more when he's rested.

199
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,480
I'm very grateful, m'lady.
To both of you.

200
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,520
Let's get him ready.

201
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:57,480
See, sometimes, we must let the blow
fall by degrees.

202
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:01,640
Give him time to find the strength
to face it.

203
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,200
Right, they're here.

204
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:12,560
May I stay to settle him in?
Very well.

205
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,600
I want to help too.

206
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,680
Lady Mary, I appreciate
your good intentions

207
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,680
but I'm concerned that
Captain Crawley's condition

208
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,760
may be very distressing for you.

209
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,600
Might I suggest that you hang back

210
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,840
until the nurses have tidied him up
a little?

211
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,360
I'm not much good at hanging back,
I'm afraid.

212
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,520
I won't get in your way, I promise,
but I will stay.

213
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:41,160
You have volunteers, don't you?
Well, that's what I am. A volunteer.

214
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,280
All right.

215
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,880
Everyone to their posts.

216
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,720
You stand there.

217
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:51,760
Yes, this gentleman's second in.
NURSE: Yes, Doctor.

218
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,800
Number two, Nurse Crawley here.

219
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,240
Yes, just here.
Gently, gently, gently.

220
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,600
Take him under his feet.

221
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,480
Cousin Matthew? Can you hear me?

222
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:25,920
He is breathing, but he's not been
conscious since we've had him.

223
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,880
They filled him full of morphine.

224
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,280
Thank you.

225
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,040
What does it say?

226
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,080
(READS) Probable spinal damage.

227
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,960
It could mean anything.
We'll know more in the morning.

228
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,840
What's this doing here?

229
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,240
I gave it to him for luck.

230
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,800
He was probably carrying it
when he fell.

231
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,840
If only it had worked.

232
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,880
He's alive, isn't he?

233
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,480
I should wash him.
This bit can be grim.

234
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:04,680
Sometimes we have to cut off the
clothes they've travelled in.

235
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,600
And there's bound to be a lot
of blood.

236
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,880
How hot should the water be?

237
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,960
Warm more than hot.
And bring some towels.

238
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,560
You should never have told her
Bates was here. Don't I know it?

239
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,160
She was even worse after she'd
seen him than before,

240
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,800
ranting on about a scandal
that would bring the roof down

241
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,680
on the House of Grantham.
Silly mare.

242
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,520
What scandal?

243
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,080
I thought she'd just come up and
take a bite out of Bates.

244
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,920
That's what it sounded like.

245
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,960
Then you should have asked more
questions.

246
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,440
You know what they say -
The devil is in the detail.

247
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:58,640
Well, I'm not standing by while she
brings misery and ruin on my lady.

248
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,920
You started it.

249
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:04,240
Oh, yes, you're very important,
aren't you? Very know-it-all.

250
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,960
With all of us at your
beck and call!

251
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,600
I'm sorry if you're angry
but don't take it out on me.

252
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,480
You did it.

253
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,240
Whom is she going to sell it to?

254
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:19,560
She didn't say. Just that there was
nothing we could do to stop her.

255
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,440
Mr Bates has given her every last
penny to keep her quiet,

256
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:27,200
but she's tricked him and now he's
got nothing left to bargain with.

257
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31,400
Well, we both know what I must do.

258
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:36,440
But how can you ask Sir Richard for
help without telling him the truth?

259
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,720
I'd rather he heard it from my lips
than read it over his breakfast.

260
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,280
Suppose he won't do anything?

261
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,080
Suppose he throws you over?

262
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,080
That's a risk I'll have to take.

263
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:55,120
I'll go up to London tomorrow
afternoon.

264
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:58,280
It's a request that demands
to be made in person.

265
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,600
What about Mr Matthew?

266
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,280
Miss Swire will be here to keep him
company.

267
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,360
I think I can take some time off
to save my own neck.

268
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,600
(WILLIAM SNORES LIGHTLY)

269
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:21,480
Why don't you go home now, Mr Mason?
And we'll see you tomorrow.

270
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,880
Are you sure you don't mind
sitting up with him?

271
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,760
He won't be alone.
Not for a moment, I promise.

272
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:38,920
He looks so perfect...lying there.

273
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,800
But he does look perfect.

274
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,480
Are you sure they've got it right?

275
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:59,360
I'm afraid so. If only I weren't.

276
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,840
Can you feel that?

277
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,680
Mmm.

278
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,720
What about that?
No.

279
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:20,200
And that, hmm?
No.

280
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,280
Nothing at all?

281
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,760
Do they know any more yet?

282
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,600
They're examining him now.

283
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,920
So he's conscious?
Just about.

284
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,960
Have they found out what happened?

285
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,080
A shell landed near them.

286
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:45,040
The explosion threw Matthew
against something.

287
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,080
Go on.

288
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,800
Dr Clarkson thinks there may be
trouble with his legs.

289
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,840
Not good news, I'm afraid.

290
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,760
I'd say the spinal cord has been
transected,

291
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,200
that it is permanently damaged.

292
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,520
You mean he won't walk again?

293
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:07,360
If I'm right, then no, he won't.

294
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,200
It's a shock, of course,
and you must be allowed to grieve.

295
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:17,000
I would only say that he will, in
all likelihood, regain his health.

296
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,720
This is not the end of his life.

297
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,520
Just the start of a different life.

298
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,680
Exactly.

299
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,440
Lord Grantham, I wonder if I might
have a word?

300
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,000
Have you got a handkerchief?

301
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:36,920
I never seem to have one in moments
of crisis. Thank you.

302
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,960
You mean there can be no children?

303
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,400
No anything, I'm afraid.

304
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,760
But isn't there a chance
that might change?

305
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,160
The sexual reflex is controlled
at a lower level of the spine

306
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,200
to the motor function of the legs.

307
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,960
Once the latter is cut off,
so is the former.

308
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,360
Right.

309
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,560
Give them a moment together.

310
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,960
What was Clarkson saying?

311
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,240
Nothing to worry you about.

312
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,960
My darling.

313
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,800
(DOG BARKS)

314
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:06,360
If he could only see the child.

315
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,880
He won't.
I've written again and again.

316
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,720
I've offered to bring him to
any place he wants.

317
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:18,280
I wasn't going to tell you this, but
he's coming on a visit this week.

318
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,320
To see his old pals.

319
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:25,480
Help me, Mrs Hughes. Let me come
to Downton and show him the baby!

320
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,760
Most certainly not!
I won't allow that.

321
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,320
Then ask him to meet me.
I know he'd listen to you.

322
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,680
I'll give you a letter.
One more can't hurt.

323
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,680
Make him read it in front of you.

324
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,840
I'll- I'll do no such thing.
Please!

325
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,800
He'd say it was none of my business
and he'd be right.

326
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:43,680
Besides, don't think I approve of
what you've done because I don't.

327
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,720
Haven't you ever made a mistake?

328
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,440
Not on this scale, no, I have not.
Sorry to disappoint you.

329
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,360
So you won't do anything?

330
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,240
I'm feeding you out of the house.
Quite wrongly, I might add.

331
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,080
I've a good mind to stop that.

332
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,360
Now I'm the one who's sorry.

333
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,360
Now, go in.
I don't know what to say.

334
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,560
It doesn't matter. He's dying.

335
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:14,720
Just say nice, warm, comforting
things. Make him feel loved.

336
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,360
You don't have to be Shakespeare.
But...

337
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:22,720
Here she is. Come over here,
where I can see you.

338
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,800
By 'eck, it were worth it,
if I get to hold your hand.

339
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,840
Don't be daft.

340
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:37,520
I've never slept in a room
as big as this. Where are we?

341
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:40,920
At the end of the South Gallery.
Now, take this.

342
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,480
Any news of Captain Crawley?

343
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:47,120
He's doing much better.
Thanks to you.

344
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:00,000
Dad'll be here in a minute.
Can you stay for a minute?

345
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,640
I ought to go down.
It's not fair on Mrs Patmore.

346
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,440
She won't mind.

347
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,280
Because- (WHEEZES)

348
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,320
-I did want to ask you something.

349
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,200
Daisy, would you ever marry me now?

350
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:14,040
And not wait for the end of the war,
like we said?

351
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:18,280
You mustn't worry about all that
for the moment now, William.

352
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,320
You're here for rest,
not excitement.

353
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,960
That's right. There's no need
to worry about it now.

354
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
First, let's get you better.
But would you think about it?

355
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:31,560
I must go. They'll be sending
out a search party soon. Just rest.

356
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,800
It would be very unusual.

357
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:45,320
I know that. Of course it would.

358
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,800
But I believe I could make it work.

359
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,840
And if your child were ill?

360
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:53,200
My mother knows what she's doing.
She's brought up five of her own.

361
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,280
Even so-
And they're only in the village.

362
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,200
I'll discuss it with Mr Carson.

363
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,560
There's nothing wrong with your
references,

364
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,280
but of course they are from
before you were married.

365
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,320
I'm a good worker.

366
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,320
And I must earn.

367
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,720
MARY: (Matthew.)

368
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,480
(DREAMLIKE) Matthew...

369
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,360
Are you feeling a bit less groggy?

370
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,360
Where's Lavinia?

371
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,400
She's gone back to unpack.

372
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,640
How's William?

373
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,960
You know he tried to save me?

374
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,600
He isn't too good, I'm afraid.

375
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,720
Any sign of Mother?

376
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,720
Not yet, but I'm sure
she's making her way back by now.

377
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:59,120
I've still got this funny thing with
my legs. I can't seem to move them.

378
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,480
Or feel them,
now that I think about it.

379
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:08,880
Did Clarkson mention
what that might be?

380
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:13,440
Why don't we wait for Lavinia
and then we can all talk about it?

381
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,520
Tell me.

382
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:20,000
You've not even been here for
24 hours.

383
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,800
Nothing will have settled down, yet.

384
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,840
Tell me.

385
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:29,320
He says you may have damaged
your spine.

386
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,760
How long will it take to repair?

387
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:38,920
We can't expect them to put timings
on that sort of thing.

388
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,560
But he did say it would get better?

389
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,720
He said the first task
is to rebuild your health.

390
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:49,400
And that's what we have
to concentrate on.

391
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,640
I see.

392
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,880
And he says there was no reason

393
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:01,360
why you should not have
a perfectly full and normal life.

394
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,440
Just not a very mobile one.

395
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:13,400
Would you like some tea? I would.

396
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,400
Thank you for telling me.

397
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:22,600
I know I'm...blubbing, but I mean it,
I'd much rather know.

398
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,920
Thank you.

399
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,560
Blub all you like.

400
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:32,320
And then, when Lavinia's here,
you can make plans.

401
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,520
Major?

402
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,680
Might I have a word?

403
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:06,480
What is it?
I have something for you.

404
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,680
Thank you.

405
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,280
I wish you would read it.

406
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,200
Do you know who wrote it?
Yes, I do.

407
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:18,640
And I know how anxious she is
for an answer.

408
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:21,760
With all due respect, I don't
believe it's any of your concern.

409
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,320
If you'd only...

410
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:30,280
If you'd only see the child.
He's a lovely wee chap...

411
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,400
Mrs Hughes, the last thing I would
wish to be is rude

412
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,800
but in this case, I really must
be left to my own devices.

413
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:41,640
Now, I'll say goodbye.
It's time I was making tracks.

414
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,680
Goodbye then, Major.

415
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:57,280
Who'd have thought it? The cold
and careful Lady Mary Crawley.

416
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,640
Well, we know better now.

417
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:03,280
I'm surprised you haven't given me
some extenuating circumstances.

418
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:08,680
I have none. I was foolish
and I was paid out for my folly.

419
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:14,120
And when I've saved you, if I can,
do you still expect me to marry you?

420
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,320
Knowing this?

421
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:19,240
That's not for me to say.

422
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,480
Of course, we both know that
if we marry,

423
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,520
people - your people...

424
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:26,400
will think you've conferred
a great blessing on me.

425
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,880
My house will welcome
the finest in the land,

426
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,800
my children will carry noble blood
in their veins.

427
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,520
But that won't be the whole story,
will it? Not anymore.

428
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,800
Sir Richard...

429
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:47,480
if you think it pains me to ask this
favour, you'd be right.

430
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:51,880
But I have no choice if I am not to
be an object of ridicule and pity.

431
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:55,080
If you wish to break off our
understanding,

432
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,040
I'll accept your decision.

433
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,720
After all,
it's never been announced.

434
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:03,080
We may dissolve it
with the minimum of discomfort.

435
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,560
Forgive me.
I don't mean to offend you.

436
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,720
I am simply paying you the compliment
of being honest.

437
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:11,560
No, in many ways,
if I can manage to bring it off,

438
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,560
this will mean we come to the
marriage

439
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,520
on slightly more equal terms.

440
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,680
I think that pleases me.

441
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,720
So you'll do it?
I'll try to do it, yes.

442
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,280
You must act fast.

443
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,520
I'll send a car for her
as soon as you've left.

444
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,080
Please let me know what it costs.

445
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,240
I'll find a way to reimburse you.

446
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,440
Never mind that.

447
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:41,240
As my future wife,
you're entitled to be in my debt.

448
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,400
We've a bit of a conundrum, my lord.

449
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,120
As you may know,
we're short of a housemaid.

450
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:51,800
We've had an application
from a local woman, Jane Moorsum,

451
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,560
but she's married
and she has a child, a son.

452
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:58,760
But surely her husband-
She is a widow, my lord.

453
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,080
The late Mr Moorsum
died on the Somme.

454
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,960
There's no other earner,
so she has to look for work.

455
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
I said I would ask you.

456
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,280
Well, if Mrs Hughes agrees,

457
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,800
I think we must do what we can
for the widows of our defenders.

458
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,840
Very good, your lordship.

459
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,600
What was that?

460
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:22,480
We're taking on a new maid. He
should have talked to me, not you.

461
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:25,160
They thought you were too busy to be
bothered with it.

462
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,280
Well, I am busy and that reminds me.

463
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:29,600
I can't come with you
to the Townsends.

464
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,840
You'll have to make some excuse.

465
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:34,200
But we gave them the date.

466
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,200
You'll think of something.

467
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,960
You always said I wouldn't have to
marry him when it came to it.

468
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:47,480
Daisy, he's dying.
What difference does it make?

469
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:51,080
All the more reason.
I can't lie to him at the end.

470
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,920
Don't make me be false
to a dying man.

471
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:56,160
What matters now is the poor lad
knows some peace and some happiness

472
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,000
before he goes.

473
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:00,640
I can't.

474
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:03,600
I don't care if you can't walk.
You must think me very feeble

475
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,840
if you believe that would make
a difference.

476
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:09,080
I know it wouldn't...

477
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:14,120
and I love you so much
for saying it.

478
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:19,360
But there is something else...which
may not have occurred to you.

479
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,760
It's just really difficult...

480
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:29,680
We can never...be properly married.

481
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:33,080
What? Of course we can be married.

482
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,560
Not properly.

483
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,640
Oh.

484
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:44,120
I see.

485
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:48,840
That's why...I have to let you go.

486
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:55,920
But...that side of things, it's not
important to me. I promise.

487
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:58,520
My darling, it's not important now.

488
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,720
But it will be.

489
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,840
And it should be.

490
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,800
And I couldn't possibly be
responsible...

491
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:13,160
for stealing away
the life you want to have.

492
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,000
I won't leave you.

493
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:18,000
I know you think I'm weak
and I don't know what I'm taking on.

494
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,920
How could you? For God's sake.

495
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:22,280
I'm not saying it'll be easy for
either of us.

496
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,640
But just because a life isn't easy
doesn't mean it isn't right.

497
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,680
I won't fight with you.

498
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,600
But I won't steal away your life.

499
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,240
Go home.

500
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,400
Think of me as dead.

501
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:43,000
Remember me as I was.

502
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:54,680
Mary's telephoned. She'll be on
a late train. It gets in at 11:00.

503
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,720
All right.

504
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,760
How's William?

505
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:05,320
It's so sad. Edith's taking care of
him but there's nothing to be done.

506
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,720
We're waiting, really.

507
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,520
What is it?

508
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:15,800
They shot the Tsar.
And all of his family.

509
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:18,560
How terrible.

510
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,280
I'm sorry.

511
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,320
I'll not deny it.

512
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,440
I never thought they'd do it.

513
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,760
But sometimes the future needs
terrible sacrifices.

514
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:32,120
You thought that, once.

515
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,040
If you mean my politics,

516
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:37,400
you know we've agreed to put that
to one side until the war is won.

517
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,040
Your lot did, but Sylvia Pankhurst
was all for fighting on.

518
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,880
Oh, don't badger me, please.

519
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,760
Sometimes a hard sacrifice
must be made

520
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,600
for a future that's worth having.

521
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:55,240
That's all I'm saying.

522
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,920
That's up to you.

523
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,600
You understand it would have to be
exclusive?

524
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,480
I couldn't have you peddling

525
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:15,160
different versions of the story
to my competitors.

526
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,160
Of course I understand.
But I can't help it

527
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,360
if they pick it up
once you've published it.

528
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:22,880
Indeed you can't. No more can I.
But I would control the timing.

529
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:26,800
You'd have to sign a binding contract
to that effect. Today.

530
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,760
I expected that.

531
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,520
And I warn you, I am unforgiving when
anyone breaks a contract with me.

532
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,720
One word out of place
and you'd find yourself in court.

533
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,200
I expected that, too.

534
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:41,080
But I'm curious.
How did you hear about me?

535
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:44,720
I know everything that goes on
in this city.

536
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,560
And what's the hurry?

537
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:49,320
I'm a newspaper man.
When I hear of something good,

538
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,480
I have to make sure of it
straight away.

539
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,520
I'm sorry if I rushed you.

540
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,560
That's all right.

541
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:58,120
You must dislike the Crawleys
very much

542
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,960
to want to subject them
to trial by scandal.

543
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,960
My husband works for them.
We're not on good terms.

544
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,800
MRS PATMORE: How is he?

545
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:18,440
His father's with him now and he
seems to understand the situation.

546
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,280
Poor man.

547
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,960
Daisy, William's asking to see you.

548
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,280
I can't go. Don't make me go.

549
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:29,120
Do you care so little for him?

550
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:34,600
It's not that. I'm very fond
of William and I'm very sad.

551
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,680
But I've led him on and led him on

552
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,200
and made him think things
that aren't true.

553
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:42,560
But he wanted them to be true. He
was happy to think they were true.

554
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,480
But that doesn't make it all right.

555
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:47,280
Shall I tell him you won't come?

556
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,640
Will you leave us a moment, Dad?

557
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,920
There's need to make him leave.

558
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:27,280
There is a need. Come here.

559
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,320
(STRUGGLES TO BREATHE)

560
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,440
You know I'm dying?

561
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,520
You don't-
I'm dying, Daisy.

562
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,480
I'm not going to make it...

563
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,520
and I don't have long.

564
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:52,440
That's why you've got to marry me.

565
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,280
What?

566
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:57,000
No, listen.

567
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,760
You'll be my widow.

568
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:03,440
A war widow with a pension
and rights.

569
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,080
You'll be looked after.

570
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:09,280
It won't be much...

571
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,640
but I'll know...

572
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,080
you've got something
to fall back on.

573
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,760
Let me do that for you. Please.

574
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,040
I can't.

575
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:22,400
It would be dishonest.

576
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,840
Almost like cheating.

577
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:29,040
But it's not cheating.
We love each other, don't we?

578
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:31,800
We'd have married
if I'd got through it

579
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:34,440
and spent our whole lives together.

580
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,960
Where's the dishonesty in that?

581
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,560
He's asked you, hasn't he?

582
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,760
I knew he would.

583
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:00,320
You'll do it, won't you?

584
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:03,760
I don't think he should be bothering
about it now.

585
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:07,120
What else should he be bothered
with?

586
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:10,840
You're the most important thing
on earth to him, Daisy.

587
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,600
You wouldn't disappoint him,
would you?

588
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:18,120
Suppose the vicar won't do it?

589
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:22,120
He may want to wait till William's
well enough to go to church.

590
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,440
But that time's not coming, is it?

591
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,600

(SNIFFS)

593
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,760
You're back.

594
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,800
How did you get on?

595
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,320
All right, I think.

596
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,560
How about you?

597
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:55,000
Matthew's told me to go home.

598
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,400
He says he won't see me again.

599
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,720
He feels he has to "set me free",
as he put it.

600
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,760
I've tried to tell him I don't care,
but he won't listen.

601
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:13,080
Then you must keep telling him.

602
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,760
Yes, but you see,
it isn't just not walking...

603
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,800
Today he told me we could never be
lovers

604
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:24,640
because all that's gone as well.
I didn't realise.

605
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:28,400
It's probably obvious to anyone
with a brain, but I didn't realise.

606
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,760
No.

607
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,200
No, nor did I.

608
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:42,520
And he feels it would be a crime
to tie me down...

609
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:46,160
to tie down any woman
to the life of a childless nun.

610
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:50,440
He thinks I'd hate him in the end.

611
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,080
I'm sorry if I've shocked you,
but there's no-one else

612
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:59,440
I could talk to about it
and when you came in, I...

613
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,280
I'm not shocked.

614
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,760
I'm just stunned...

615
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,920
and desperately sad.

616
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:10,840
I'll die if I can't be with him.

Earl and Countess of Grantham

620
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:28,600
and Sir Richard Carlisle, son of
Mr and the late Mrs Mark Carlisle,

621
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,600
of Morningside, Edinburgh.

622
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,680
Is this why you went to see him?

623
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,880
Why didn't you say it'd be
in today's paper?

624
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:37,640
I didn't know. Well, surely
he asked your permission?

625
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:40,200
I don't think asking permission
is his strongest suit.

626
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,240
That's very high-handed.

627
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:44,360
You can't let him get away with it.

628
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,400
Well, it's done now.

629
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:49,400
What is it?
William's wedding, my lord.

630
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,320
If it can be arranged
for this afternoon,

631
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,280
the indoor staff
would like to attend.

632
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:55,800
We don't yet know if Mr Travis
will agree to do it.

633
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:58,760
I'm afraid he has very little time
to make up his mind.

634
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,480
This boy is in extremis.

635
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:08,040
How can we know that these
are his true wishes?

636
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:13,560
Maybe the kitchen maid somehow
hopes to catch at an advantage?

637
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,520
And what advantage would that be?

638
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:19,640
Some widow's dole given
by a grateful nation?

639
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:22,840
Mr Travis, can I remind you?

640
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:26,600
William Mason has served
our family well.

641
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:32,160
At the last, he saved the life,
if not the health, of my son's heir.

642
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:37,160
Now he wishes, before he dies,
to marry his sweetheart.

643
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:40,240
Yes, but- You cannot imagine that
we would allow you

644
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:44,000
to prevent this happening
in case his widow claimed her dole?

645
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:47,400
No, but-
I have had an interest in this boy.

646
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:51,440
I tried and failed to save him
from conscription,

647
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:54,800
but I will certainly attend
his wedding.

648
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:57,600
Is that an argument in its favour?

649
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:59,720
Of course, but...

650
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:03,800
Finally, I would point out, your
living is in Lord Grantham's gift,

651
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:06,920
your house is on Lord Grantham's land

652
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:11,080
and the very flowers in your church
are from Lord Grantham's garden.

653
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:13,840
I hope it is not vulgar in me

654
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:18,480
to suggest that you find some way
to overcome your scruples.

655
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:22,360
But you can't have expected
much more?

656
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,880
Not when those letters
all went unanswered.

657
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:29,760
I don't know what I expected
but you can't help hoping.

658
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,200
Have you found any work?

659
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,200
A bit of scrubbing.

660
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:41,920
There aren't many places
I can take the baby.

661
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,240
What do you tell them?

662
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:48,440
That my husband died at the front.

663
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,360
It's funny.

664
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:58,480
We have a new maid, Jane, who really
is a war widow, with a child,

665
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:00,920
and we respect her for it.

666
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:04,440
But then, we believe her story.

667
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,200
Mrs Bates, I really must insist...

668
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,520
You tricked me!
Well? Aren't you going to deny it?

669
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:15,720
Certainly not. I tricked you to
protect my fiancee's good name.

670
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:18,520
That's one word for her.
I can think of a few others.

671
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:22,160
You'd better not speak them aloud
if you know what's good for you.

672
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,840
I don't want your money!
I don't want that contract!

673
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:26,880
It's too late for that.

674
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:29,120
And I warn you,
if I so much as read her name

675
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:31,160
in anything but the Court Circular,

676
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:35,360
I shall hound you and ruin you and
have you locked up. Is that clear?

677
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:42,240
It doesn't end here, you know.
Not for John Bates.

678
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:44,480
Lady Mary might have got away,
what do I care?

679
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:46,320
But he won't.

680
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:48,800
You tell him.

681
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:50,600
That's entirely your own affair.

682
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,440
Where do we start?

683
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:01,280
You tell me.

684
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:03,560
Oh! Your lordship, I-I do apologise.

685
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:06,640
I thought Mrs Hughes said we were
to clean in here.

686
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:08,520
You must be the new maid.

687
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:11,560
I am. Jane.

688
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:16,120
And it's very kind of you and
her ladyship to take me on.

689
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:20,080
Not a bit. We all owe your
late husband a great debt.

690
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:24,120
Thank you.

691
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:27,520
M'lord, there's a telephone call
for...

692
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:29,920
Jane? Whatever are you doing?

693
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:32,400
You're wanted in the drawing room,
not the library,

694
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:34,280
to clean it while the men
are out of it.

695
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:38,040
She's very willing, but she's not
quite there, yet. I am sorry.

696
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:40,240
Oh, don't be. What about that call?

697
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:42,080
For Lady Mary. They're waiting now.

698
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:43,840
You might just catch her
if you hurry.

699
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:45,680
She's on her way to the hospital.

700
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:00,240
His lordship asked Mr Bassett
to bring these in for you.

701
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:02,280
Ah, how lovely.

702
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:05,720
Here, Daisy, sit down.

703
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:10,400
I shouldn't be doing this.
It's just a lie. You know it is.

704
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:13,120
You're doing it out of the goodness
of your heart.

705
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:15,880
The falseness of my heart, more like.

706
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:18,160
She's not quite the blooming bride.

707
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:20,880
I don't think it's the same
when you're marrying a corpse.

708
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:22,720
Are you going?

709
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:25,680
Why not? I wouldn't mind shaking
William's hand before he goes.

710
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:29,880
Is that sentiment or superstition,
in case he haunts you?

711
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:35,960
You look lovely, dear.

712
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:39,680
Just to say the vicar
is ready for us.

713
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:43,240
Let's go up, then.

714
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:08,600
Dearly beloved...we are
gathered together here

715
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:12,480
in the sight of God and in the face
of this congregation,

716
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:16,640
to join together this man
and this woman in holy matrimony...

717
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:19,760
which is an honourable estate,

718
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:22,760
instituted of God
in the time of man's innocency,

719
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:26,600
signifying unto us the mystical
union that is... (FADES OUT)

720
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:31,040
If any man can show any just cause

721
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:34,760
why they may not lawfully
be joined together,

722
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:39,880
let them now speak or else hereafter
forever hold his peace...

723
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:49,200
Have you the ring?

724
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:12,000
(SNIFFS)
I have a cold.

725
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:14,960
You may now kiss the bride.

726
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:30,260
She's better off in London.

727
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:32,420
If you say so.

728
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:35,620
Do you know why I sent her away?

729
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:37,660
I think so.

730
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:42,380
Then you'll know I couldn't
marry her.

731
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:44,580
Not now.

732
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:47,300
I couldn't marry any woman.

733
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:51,780
And if they should just want to be
with you? On any terms?

734
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:55,860
No-one sane would want to be with me
as I am now.

735
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:59,500
Including me.

736
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:03,900
Oh, God, I think I'm going
to be sick.

737
00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:09,940
It's all right.
(VOMITS)

738
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:11,980
It's perfectly all right.

739
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:21,500
What is it?

740
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:26,300
I was just thinking.
It seems such a short time ago

741
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:29,020
since I turned you down.
And now look at me.

742
00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:32,700
An impotent cripple,
stinking of sick. What a reversal.

743
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:36,540
You have to admit, it's quite funny.

744
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:42,780
All I'll admit is that you're here
and you've survived the war.

745
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:44,820
That's enough for now.

746
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:58,100
You're back. He'll be so pleased.

747
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:02,460
You've become quite a nurse
since I last saw you.

748
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:06,220
Oh, no. It's nothing.
Sybil's the nurse in this family.

749
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:08,420
It's the very opposite of nothing.

750
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:19,140
Mother...

751
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:30,580
Bates, what's happened?
How's William?

752
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:33,820
He's nearly there, m'lady.

753
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:35,860
I am so sorry.

754
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:39,740
Actually, Bates,
I'm glad I've caught you.

755
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:42,580
Sir Richard Carlisle telephoned me
earlier.

756
00:50:42,620 --> 00:50:45,100
He says he's paid Mrs Bates for her
story.

757
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:48,340
She cannot speak of it now
without risking prison.

758
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:50,380
She won't do that.

759
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:52,500
So I hope we can all forget it.

760
00:50:52,540 --> 00:50:55,100
It's forgotten already, m'lady.

761
00:50:55,140 --> 00:50:57,140
Thank you.

762
00:50:58,220 --> 00:51:01,900
I'm afraid she was very angry
when she knew she had been silenced.

763
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:04,220
I can imagine.

764
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:06,460
He says she made threats
against you.

765
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:10,500
"If I go down, I'll take him
with me." That sort of thing.

766
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:13,580
I'm sure she didn't mean it.
Are you, m'lady?

767
00:51:13,620 --> 00:51:17,620
Well...you'd know better than I.

768
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:27,900
Lady Mary's back.

769
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:30,380
I've just seen her.
She says it's worked.

770
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:32,620
Sir Richard has put a gag on Vera.

771
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:37,780
Thank God. So everything in our
garden is rosy again?

772
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:40,820
I hope so. I certainly hope so.

773
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:04,940
You must be so tired, my lamb.

774
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:08,500
Why not let me take over
for a while and go and lie down?

775
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:11,420
No, thank you, Mrs Patmore,
I'll stay with him.

776
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:14,140
I won't leave him now,
not while he needs me.

777
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:16,740
He doesn't need you no more, Daisy.

778
00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:22,860
He doesn't need none of us no more.

779
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:34,420
Don't tell me you'll miss me.
I will, Mr Carson. Very much.

780
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:36,220
It means I'm not divorced after all.

781
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:38,780
We will be together,
whether she wants it or not.

782
00:52:38,820 --> 00:52:41,780
Sometimes, Cora,
you can be curiously unfeeling.

783
00:52:41,820 --> 00:52:44,660
I'll wait forever.
I'm not asking for forever.

784
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:46,540
I don't have to marry him, you know.

785
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:49,860
You've given me the power to destroy
you and don't think I won't use it.

786
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:52,660
How was it?
Worse than you can possibly imagine.

787
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:56,380
Am I really a stranger?
Do you not recognise me at all?

788
00:52:56,420 --> 00:53:00,100
If he's alive, then I am no longer
the future Earl of Grantham.

789
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:02,140
