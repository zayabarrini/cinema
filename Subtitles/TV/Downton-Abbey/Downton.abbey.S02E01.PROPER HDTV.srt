00:00:23,721 --> 00:00:26,243
(SHOUTING)

3
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,815
Here we are! You'll be all right!

4
00:00:46,889 --> 00:00:49,688
Sergeant Stephens. Yes, sir.
I want every wounded man

5
00:00:49,689 --> 00:00:51,967
taken down the line
before it starts to get dark.

6
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:54,249
We've bloody well lost enough of them
for one day.

7
00:00:59,769 --> 00:01:02,009
When did this arrive?
This morning, sir.

8
00:01:03,089 --> 00:01:05,128
Ah, good news.

9
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:07,248
We're to be relieved today
by the Devons.

10
00:01:07,249 --> 00:01:08,968
The men can finally get some rest

11
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:11,008
and I've got a few days' leave
coming to me.

12
00:01:11,009 --> 00:01:13,488
What will you do with them, sir?
London first.

13
00:01:13,489 --> 00:01:15,968
To remind myself what real food
tastes like.

14
00:01:15,969 --> 00:01:18,449
Then north for a couple of days,
I suppose.

15
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:22,048
Naturally, there's a girl I want to
see while I'm there.

16
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:24,088
So I should hope, sir.

17
00:01:24,089 --> 00:01:25,808
It's strange, isn't it?

18
00:01:25,809 --> 00:01:28,287
To think about our old lives just
going on as before.

19
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:30,729
While we're here, in this.
It's more than strange.

20
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:32,768
When I think of my life at Downton,

21
00:01:32,769 --> 00:01:34,769
it seems like another world.

22
00:02:11,609 --> 00:02:14,488
We normally have everything done
before the family wakes up,

23
00:02:14,489 --> 00:02:16,329
but it's all at sixes and sevens
today.

24
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:19,328
I'll go through it with you
tomorrow, when we're back to normal.

25
00:02:19,329 --> 00:02:21,329
I do know how to run a house.

26
00:02:24,249 --> 00:02:26,249
Come along.

27
00:02:28,569 --> 00:02:31,449
It goes under the epaulette.
I'm sorry, M'Lord.

28
00:02:31,969 --> 00:02:34,088
If I'd known, I'd have asked
Mr Bates about it

29
00:02:34,089 --> 00:02:35,808
before he left for London.

30
00:02:35,809 --> 00:02:38,809
Because I'll be in uniform
a lot of the time, in future.

31
00:02:39,129 --> 00:02:42,008
Does being lord lieutenant mean
you're back in the army?

32
00:02:42,009 --> 00:02:44,728
Not exactly. The lord liet' is
responsible for the army

33
00:02:44,729 --> 00:02:46,528
in the county while the war's on.

34
00:02:46,529 --> 00:02:49,648
But, no, I'm not back in the army.

35
00:02:49,649 --> 00:02:51,649
It appears they don't want me.

36
00:03:00,449 --> 00:03:02,449
(BARKING)

37
00:03:04,649 --> 00:03:08,288
Morning. I don't suppose there's
any news of Bates?

38
00:03:08,289 --> 00:03:10,209
We expect him back any day, My Lord.

39
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:12,848
He wrote to Anna that they had the
funeral last Monday.

40
00:03:12,849 --> 00:03:16,608
William's a good chap, but he's not
Bates when it comes to uniforms.

41
00:03:16,609 --> 00:03:18,608
I may not be a real soldier,

44
00:03:25,129 --> 00:03:27,089
Isobel said she was coming up
to help

45
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:29,168
and your mother threatened
to look in.

46
00:03:29,169 --> 00:03:32,369
No doubt they would love it
if they found me still in bed.

47
00:03:34,649 --> 00:03:36,368
I don't believe it.

48
00:03:36,369 --> 00:03:38,968
Please say it's something nice.

49
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:40,688
General Robertson's invited me

50
00:03:40,689 --> 00:03:43,768
to be Colonel of the North Riding
Volunteers. This is the best bit.

51

(READS)
'lt may please you to know

52
00:03:45,529 --> 00:03:47,808
that the idea was given to me
by General Haig.'

53
00:03:47,809 --> 00:03:50,888
Well if Haig's involved, it means
I'm back in the army properly.

54
00:03:50,889 --> 00:03:54,248
How can that be? You were told you
weren't wanted for active service.

55
00:03:54,249 --> 00:03:57,088
You can't jump in and out of the
army like a jack-in-the-box.

56
00:03:57,089 --> 00:03:59,768
I don't see why not.
Churchill went back to the front

57
00:03:59,769 --> 00:04:03,088
after the Gallipoli business.
If he can do it, why shouldn't I?

58
00:04:03,089 --> 00:04:05,128
Sybil, are you all right?

59
00:04:05,129 --> 00:04:07,168
Sybil, darling?

60
00:04:07,169 --> 00:04:09,409
Would you excuse me.
I think I'll just...

61
00:04:11,289 --> 00:04:13,289
She's had more bad news.

62
00:04:17,609 --> 00:04:21,488
I do think I'm getting better,
don't you? Up to a point, M'Lady.

63
00:04:21,489 --> 00:04:23,648
(GEARS CRUNCH)
If you could just get the clutch

64
00:04:23,649 --> 00:04:26,129
right down to the floor. But I am.
Not quite, M'Lady.

65
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:28,168
It doesn't seem to want to go.

66
00:04:28,169 --> 00:04:30,328
I think it wants to,
if you ask it properly.

67
00:04:30,329 --> 00:04:32,408
(GEARS CRUNCH AND RELEASE)
That's better.

68
00:04:32,409 --> 00:04:34,168
You'll be putting me out of a job.

69
00:04:34,169 --> 00:04:36,289
Won't the call up put you all
out of your jobs?

70
00:04:37,409 --> 00:04:39,648
I'll cross that bridge
when I come to it.

71
00:04:39,649 --> 00:04:41,808
(HORN BEEPS)

72
00:04:41,809 --> 00:04:44,168
What are you giving them to eat?
Not much.

73
00:04:44,169 --> 00:04:46,248
They know the money's
for the hospital,

74
00:04:46,249 --> 00:04:48,448
so they can't expect
Belshazzar's Feast.

75
00:04:48,449 --> 00:04:51,768
I'll make some cheese straws.
What's the matter with you?

76
00:04:51,769 --> 00:04:54,369
Nothing much.
My dad still won't let me enlist.

77
00:04:55,809 --> 00:04:57,808
Your father has no-one but you.

78
00:04:57,809 --> 00:05:01,048
Of course he doesn't want you to
enlist. Who can argue with him?

79
00:05:01,049 --> 00:05:04,928
So I stand by while the lads on the
farms and in the gardens go to war.

80
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:07,249
Even Thomas is at the front in the
Medical Corps.

81
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,288
Ha, that'll come as a nasty shock.

82
00:05:09,289 --> 00:05:11,528
Oh, you can make fun of him,
Mrs Patmore,

83
00:05:11,529 --> 00:05:14,009
but he's fight for his king and
country and I'm not.

84
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:16,208
Well, I dare say you won't have long
to wait.

85
00:05:16,209 --> 00:05:18,888
Well, I hope you're right.
Do you?

86
00:05:18,889 --> 00:05:22,849
Because I don't.
I hope very much that I am wrong.

87
00:05:24,489 --> 00:05:28,128
It's kind of you to let us have it
here. They'll enjoy it so much more.

88
00:05:28,129 --> 00:05:30,688
And you can charge so much more
for the tickets.

89
00:05:30,689 --> 00:05:33,888
Good morning, Mama. This is very
early for you to be up and about.

90
00:05:33,889 --> 00:05:36,488
War makes early risers of us all.

91
00:05:36,489 --> 00:05:38,609
I thought I would help with
the flowers.

92
00:05:40,449 --> 00:05:42,368
Bassett has plenty...

93
00:05:42,369 --> 00:05:44,289
but thank you.

94
00:05:47,649 --> 00:05:50,448
You don't mind my taking over
the flowers, do you?

95
00:05:50,449 --> 00:05:54,528
Cora's flowers always look more
suited to a first communion...

96
00:05:54,529 --> 00:05:56,849
in southern Italy.

97
00:05:58,609 --> 00:06:01,688
Well, what else have you planned
for tonight's revels?

98
00:06:01,689 --> 00:06:04,328
Anything we can think of that will
raise money.

99
00:06:04,329 --> 00:06:08,129
Hot, buttered toast with a countess
at tuppence a slice?

100
00:06:09,809 --> 00:06:12,369
You drop the cushions on the floor
to plump them up.

101
00:06:13,089 --> 00:06:15,008
I know.

102
00:06:15,009 --> 00:06:16,769
Ethel, are you settling in?

103
00:06:17,489 --> 00:06:21,089
I would be... if Anna'd stop
teaching me how to suck eggs.

104
00:06:21,609 --> 00:06:23,888
I was head housemaid
in my last position.

105
00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:28,408
You were senior housemaid,
out of two, in a much smaller house.

106
00:06:28,409 --> 00:06:30,488
Are they to come in here tonight?

107
00:06:30,489 --> 00:06:33,288
Only at the interval. And keep them
out of the drawing room.

108
00:06:33,289 --> 00:06:35,448
I thought Mr Bates would've been
back by now,

109
00:06:35,449 --> 00:06:37,129
or he could've stood guard.

110
00:06:39,009 --> 00:06:41,928
Who is this Mr Bates?
His Lordship's valet.

111
00:06:41,929 --> 00:06:44,408
He's been in London
because his mother died.

112
00:06:44,409 --> 00:06:47,288
Only everyone talks about him
as if her were king.

113
00:06:47,289 --> 00:06:49,409
Do they? That's nice to hear.

114
00:06:49,769 --> 00:06:51,808
Anna...

115
00:06:51,809 --> 00:06:55,729
help me do battle with
this monstrosity.

116
00:06:56,889 --> 00:06:59,729
Looks like a creature from
The Lost World.

117
00:07:01,449 --> 00:07:03,449
Oh...

118
00:07:08,809 --> 00:07:10,968
You should let William do that.

119
00:07:10,969 --> 00:07:13,008
He's got enough on his hands,

120
00:07:13,009 --> 00:07:15,248
getting the uniforms out of
mothballs.

121
00:07:15,249 --> 00:07:18,648
(STRAINED) I must remember to put
Anna on alert for dinner tonight.

122
00:07:18,649 --> 00:07:23,088
You have to ease up a bit or you'll
give yourself a heart attack.

123
00:07:23,089 --> 00:07:26,288
There's a war on. Things cannot
be the same when there's a war on.

124
00:07:26,289 --> 00:07:30,208
I do not agree. Keeping up standards
is the only way to show the Germans

125
00:07:30,209 --> 00:07:32,328
that they will not beat us
in the end.

126
00:07:32,329 --> 00:07:34,448
Well, give me some warning
the next time

127
00:07:34,449 --> 00:07:37,729
we're expecting Germans at Downton
and I'll see what I can do.

128
00:07:41,849 --> 00:07:43,888
Thank you.

129
00:07:43,889 --> 00:07:46,529
Oh, we thought we'd come in here
for a little talk.

130
00:07:47,969 --> 00:07:50,329
Oh, well I'm sure we won't be
disturbed.

131
00:07:51,609 --> 00:07:53,289
Please.

132
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:58,488
Well, the thing is...

133
00:07:58,489 --> 00:08:00,328
I've had a letter from Matthew.

134
00:08:00,329 --> 00:08:03,488
Of course, he doesn't tell me
what he's actually doing.

135
00:08:03,489 --> 00:08:05,288
No, he wouldn't.

136
00:08:05,289 --> 00:08:07,288
But I'm glad he's all right.
I miss him.

137
00:08:07,289 --> 00:08:09,008
Well, that's the point.

138
00:08:09,009 --> 00:08:12,088
You must know he's been down here
a few times since the war started.

139
00:08:12,089 --> 00:08:14,128
We had heard.

140
00:08:14,129 --> 00:08:16,288
Downton is hardly a metropolis.

141
00:08:16,289 --> 00:08:19,488
Is he still determined to go back
to Manchester when it's all over?

142
00:08:19,489 --> 00:08:22,768
He doesn't talk much about life
after the war, none of them do.

143
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:25,008
I suppose they don't want to
tempt fate.

144
00:08:25,009 --> 00:08:27,009
Until now, that is.

145
00:08:28,009 --> 00:08:32,329
He writes that he is engaged to be
married to a Miss Lavinia Swire.

146
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:41,408
Well... I suppose we all knew
it would happen one day.

147
00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:43,409
Do you know her?
Not yet.

148
00:08:44,729 --> 00:08:47,688
Apparently they met when he was in
England last time.

149
00:08:47,689 --> 00:08:49,888
It all seems rather hurried.

150
00:08:49,889 --> 00:08:52,688
You can't blame them for wanting to
live in the present.

151
00:08:52,689 --> 00:08:54,609
Anyway, he's been in London on leave

152
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:56,768
and now he's bringing her here to
meet me.

153
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:58,649
He'll be here tonight and tomorrow,

154
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:01,568
and then he leaves on Thursday,
while she stays for a bit.

155
00:09:01,569 --> 00:09:04,848
So will you miss the concert?
Well, that's up to you.

156
00:09:04,849 --> 00:09:08,368
We'd all hoped that he and Mary
would sort things out between them.

157
00:09:08,369 --> 00:09:12,088
But if that's not to be, shouldn't
we try to get back to normal?

158
00:09:12,089 --> 00:09:14,808
Even if he's not keen to live
in the village...

159
00:09:14,809 --> 00:09:16,609
he's still the heir.

160
00:09:18,049 --> 00:09:20,088
And you're still his family.

161
00:09:20,089 --> 00:09:21,848
I quite agree.

162
00:09:21,849 --> 00:09:24,008
We can't know if Matthew will come
through it.

163
00:09:24,009 --> 00:09:27,328
Either way, I would like to see him
and I want to wish him luck.

164
00:09:27,329 --> 00:09:29,888
The trouble is, Mary's back from
London today as well.

165
00:09:29,889 --> 00:09:31,928
She gets in at five o'clock.

166
00:09:31,929 --> 00:09:35,888
Matthew's driving down in Lavinia's
car, they won't meet on the train.

167
00:09:35,889 --> 00:09:38,129
Oh, that's a relief.

168
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:41,768
I hate Greek drama.

169
00:09:41,769 --> 00:09:44,208
You know, when everything happens
off stage.

170
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:47,648
But should we tell her not to come?
We might still catch her.

171
00:09:47,649 --> 00:09:49,688
Isobel's right.

172
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:52,168
We must use this engagement
as a new beginning.

173
00:09:52,169 --> 00:09:54,888
You bring our Lieutenant Crawley
to the concert

174
00:09:54,889 --> 00:09:56,608
and stay for dinner afterwards.

175
00:09:56,609 --> 00:09:58,609
I was hoping you'd say that.

176
00:10:05,329 --> 00:10:08,848
Oh, there you are. I'm just going
home, but I'll be back at four.

177
00:10:08,849 --> 00:10:10,849
Sybil, my dear, what's the matter?

178
00:10:16,609 --> 00:10:19,009
Tom Bellasis has been killed.

179
00:10:20,249 --> 00:10:22,168
What a terrible thing.

180
00:10:22,169 --> 00:10:24,169
I remember him at Imogen's ball.

181
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:28,649
He made me laugh out loud just as
her uncle was giving a speech.

182
00:10:30,769 --> 00:10:33,448
Sometimes...

183
00:10:33,449 --> 00:10:36,209
it feels as if all the men
I ever danced with are dead.

184
00:10:38,729 --> 00:10:40,768
I just feel so useless,

185
00:10:40,769 --> 00:10:43,848
wasting my life while they sacrifice
theirs.

186
00:10:43,849 --> 00:10:46,888
You've been a tremendous help with
the concert. No, I...

187
00:10:46,889 --> 00:10:50,648
I don't mean selling programmes or
finding prizes for the tombola.

188
00:10:50,649 --> 00:10:54,089
I want to do a real job, real work.

189
00:10:54,769 --> 00:10:56,769
Well...

190
00:10:58,249 --> 00:11:01,328
if you're serious, what about
being an auxiliary nurse?

191
00:11:01,329 --> 00:11:03,247
There's a training college in York.

192
00:11:03,248 --> 00:11:05,209
I know I could get you on to
a course.

193
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:09,288
It may be something of a rough
awakening. Are you ready for that?

194
00:11:09,289 --> 00:11:12,048
I mean, have you ever made
your own bed, for example?

195
00:11:12,049 --> 00:11:14,008
Or scrubbed a floor?

196
00:11:14,009 --> 00:11:16,009
O'Brien, what is it?

197
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:19,968
Mr Platt is taking Her Ladyship and
Lady Grantham down to the village.

198
00:11:19,969 --> 00:11:22,168
She wondered if you'd like to go
with them.

199
00:11:22,169 --> 00:11:24,409
That's very kind. Thank you.

200
00:11:26,409 --> 00:11:28,448
Go on, what else would I need?

201
00:11:28,449 --> 00:11:30,969
Well, if you're serious,
what about cooking?

202
00:11:31,489 --> 00:11:33,728
Why don't you ask Mrs Patmore

203
00:11:33,729 --> 00:11:36,888
if she could give you one or two
basic tips?

204
00:11:36,889 --> 00:11:38,727
When you get to York,
it might be useful

205
00:11:38,728 --> 00:11:40,449
to know a little more than nothing.

206
00:11:42,329 --> 00:11:45,809
They want to use her as a maid of
all work at the hospital.

207
00:11:46,529 --> 00:11:49,808
I suppose it's cheaper when Lady
Sybil can live here for nothing.

208
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:52,888
But it doesn't see quite right,
somehow, to take advantage.

209
00:11:52,889 --> 00:11:54,889
No, it does not.

210
00:11:54,969 --> 00:11:58,568
I hear the young men that are being
brought in now are very disfigured.

211
00:11:58,569 --> 00:12:00,608
How terrible.

212
00:12:00,609 --> 00:12:02,649
Limbs missing and faces blown apart.

213
00:12:03,649 --> 00:12:06,689
And Lady Sybil's been nurtured
so very gently.

214
00:12:08,209 --> 00:12:10,449
And what types would she be working
with?

215
00:12:11,969 --> 00:12:14,009
Still, you'll know what's best
to do.

216
00:12:15,489 --> 00:12:17,528
Yes.

217
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:19,769
I certainly will.

218
00:12:25,929 --> 00:12:29,288
Where's the butter for the pancakes?
It's in the cold larder.

219
00:12:29,289 --> 00:12:31,729
Are we having pancakes tonight?
Are we heck as like.

220
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:34,048
Upstairs dinner, crepes Suzette.

221
00:12:34,049 --> 00:12:36,848
Oh, I've always wanted to try those.
Could you save me some?

222
00:12:36,849 --> 00:12:38,888
If they don't finish them all.

223
00:12:38,889 --> 00:12:41,728
Save you some crepes Suzette?

224
00:12:41,729 --> 00:12:44,049
If you don't mind.
What are we having?

225
00:12:44,569 --> 00:12:47,888
Lamb stew and semolina.
Do you eat a lot of stews?

226
00:12:47,889 --> 00:12:51,408
Don't you fancy that, dear?
Not all the time.

227
00:12:51,409 --> 00:12:53,448
Oh, I see.

228
00:12:53,449 --> 00:12:56,048
Would you like to sleep
in Her Ladyship's bedroom

229
00:12:56,049 --> 00:12:58,009
while you're at it?
I wouldn't mind.

230
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:01,168
I hate sharing a room.
I didn't in my last place.

231
00:13:01,169 --> 00:13:04,528
There were only two maids
and a cook. I'm just saying.

232
00:13:04,529 --> 00:13:08,529
And I'll 'just say' if you don't
look out!

233
00:13:11,449 --> 00:13:13,568
You've got a cheek,
on your first day.

234
00:13:13,569 --> 00:13:15,608
I don't see why.

235
00:13:15,609 --> 00:13:17,968
I want the best and I'm not ashamed
to admit it.

236
00:13:17,969 --> 00:13:19,808
And you think we don't?

237
00:13:19,809 --> 00:13:21,729
I think it's hard to change
at your age.

238
00:13:23,249 --> 00:13:25,688
I don't blame you, but I suppose,

239
00:13:25,689 --> 00:13:28,049
in the end, I want to be more than
just a servant.

240
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:40,208
I'm sorry,

241
00:13:40,209 --> 00:13:42,288
but if Dr Clarkson needs free labour,

242
00:13:42,289 --> 00:13:44,728
I'd prefer him not to find it in
my nursery.

243
00:13:44,729 --> 00:13:47,768
But Sybil isn't in the nursery.
And in case you hadn't noticed,

244
00:13:47,769 --> 00:13:50,568
she hasn't been there for some time.
You know what I mean.

245
00:13:50,569 --> 00:13:52,608
Well, no, not really.

246
00:13:52,609 --> 00:13:55,288
You can't pretend it's not
respectable.

247
00:13:55,289 --> 00:13:59,408
When every day we're treated to
pictures of queens and princesses

248
00:13:59,409 --> 00:14:04,088
in Red Cross uniform, ladling soup
down the throat of some unfortunate.

249
00:14:04,089 --> 00:14:05,888
But Sybil won't be ladling soup.

250
00:14:05,889 --> 00:14:08,248
She'll have to witness unimaginable
horrors.

251
00:14:08,249 --> 00:14:11,248
When she's an innocent.
Her innocence will protect her.

252
00:14:11,249 --> 00:14:13,569
For once, I agree with
Cousin Isobel.

253
00:14:14,889 --> 00:14:18,049
Sybil must be allowed to do her bit,
like everyone else.

254
00:14:20,529 --> 00:14:24,369
What about you, Molesley? Are you
ready for the call, if it comes?

255
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:26,288
It won't be coming for me, M'Lady.

256
00:14:26,289 --> 00:14:30,208
I had a letter from the War Office
to say I'm not suitable for service.

257
00:14:30,209 --> 00:14:32,248
Why not?

258
00:14:32,249 --> 00:14:34,288
I really couldn't say, M'Lady.

259
00:14:34,289 --> 00:14:37,488
As you can imagine, Molesley's
father is beside himself with joy.

260
00:14:37,489 --> 00:14:40,849
God moves in a mysterious way.
His wonders to perform.

261
00:15:05,729 --> 00:15:08,808
Bates, no-one told me
you were on this train.

262
00:15:08,809 --> 00:15:10,848
They didn't know, M'Lady.

263
00:15:10,849 --> 00:15:12,809
We'll give you a lift to the house.

264
00:15:40,049 --> 00:15:43,769
Why didn't you say you were coming?
I didn't know till today.

265
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:53,568
Anna, I borrowed a case from
Lady Rosamund.

266
00:15:53,569 --> 00:15:56,688
I bought some things while I was
in London. Very good, M'Lady.

267
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:58,728
Well, it would be our secret.

268
00:15:58,729 --> 00:16:01,408
A surprise. You don't mind, do you?

269
00:16:01,409 --> 00:16:03,448
Oh, it's not that I mind, M'Lady...

270
00:16:03,449 --> 00:16:05,488
And I only need the basics.

271
00:16:05,489 --> 00:16:07,528
How to boil an egg, how to make tea.

272
00:16:07,529 --> 00:16:09,529
Don't you know how to make tea?

273
00:16:09,609 --> 00:16:11,329
Not really.

274
00:16:12,209 --> 00:16:14,208
You're right, it is a joke.

275
00:16:14,209 --> 00:16:17,048
But when I start my course,
I don't want to be a joke.

276
00:16:17,049 --> 00:16:19,529
Will you help me?
Course we will, won't we?

277
00:16:20,329 --> 00:16:22,368
If you say so.

278
00:16:22,369 --> 00:16:24,408
Let's get started.

279
00:16:24,409 --> 00:16:26,608
Do you know how to fill a kettle?

280
00:16:26,609 --> 00:16:28,769
Everyone knows that.

281
00:16:33,089 --> 00:16:35,089
Not everyone, apparently.

282
00:16:45,569 --> 00:16:47,408
Oh...

283
00:16:47,409 --> 00:16:49,288
When can I talk to you?

284
00:16:49,289 --> 00:16:51,928
After the concert.
Outside, in the courtyard.

285
00:16:51,929 --> 00:16:54,729
There's bound to be a gap
before they start dinner.

286
00:16:56,609 --> 00:16:59,448
Are you going up for the concert?
Maybe. Can I sit with you?

287
00:16:59,449 --> 00:17:01,409
Don't be daft, we've got a dinner
to make.

288
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:04,328
I've not got time for concerts.
I've had a letter from my dad.

289
00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:06,807
He won't change his mind.
He says he can live with it

290
00:17:06,808 --> 00:17:09,129
if I get called up, as there's
nothing we can do.

291
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:12,208
But if I enlist and anything
happens, he'll never get over it.

292
00:17:12,209 --> 00:17:15,848
He loves you. He may love me,
but he doesn't own me.

293
00:17:15,849 --> 00:17:17,849
And he's not being fair.

294
00:17:19,649 --> 00:17:22,928
Glad to be back?
I'm never sure.

295
00:17:22,929 --> 00:17:26,048
When I'm in London, I long
for Yorkshire and when I'm here,

296
00:17:26,049 --> 00:17:28,728
I ache to hear my heels clicking on
the pavement.

297
00:17:28,729 --> 00:17:31,288
I'd forgotten about this nightmare
concert.

298
00:17:31,289 --> 00:17:33,729
Why didn't you warn me?
I'd have come back tomorrow.

299
00:17:34,249 --> 00:17:36,249
But you'd have missed Matthew.

300
00:17:37,929 --> 00:17:39,968
I was going to tell you.

301
00:17:39,969 --> 00:17:43,288
Matthew's on leave and he's in the
village,

302
00:17:43,289 --> 00:17:46,688
so Papa and I thought it would be
a good time to mend our fences.

303
00:17:46,689 --> 00:17:48,728
He's coming tonight with Isobel.

304
00:17:48,729 --> 00:17:50,689
And his fiancee.

305
00:17:51,889 --> 00:17:53,928
What?
Edith...

306
00:17:53,929 --> 00:17:56,289
I don't know how helpful
you're being.

307
00:17:57,489 --> 00:17:59,528
Matthew's engaged.

308
00:17:59,529 --> 00:18:01,929
He's brought her to Downton to meet
his mother.

309
00:18:03,689 --> 00:18:05,689
Well, how marvellous.

310
00:18:07,089 --> 00:18:09,529
You don't mind?
Why should I?

311
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,888
We're not going to marry,

312
00:18:11,889 --> 00:18:14,608
but I don't want him to spend the
rest of his life in a cave.

313
00:18:14,609 --> 00:18:16,409
Exactly what Papa and I feel.

314
00:18:17,289 --> 00:18:19,328
Please try to be happy for him.

315
00:18:19,329 --> 00:18:22,089
Of course I'm happy.
Good luck to him.

316
00:18:23,209 --> 00:18:25,568
Anyway, there's someone I want you
all to meet.

317
00:18:25,569 --> 00:18:28,009
Have you ever come across
Richard Carlisle?

318
00:18:28,329 --> 00:18:30,368
Sir Richard Carlisle?

319
00:18:30,369 --> 00:18:32,888
The one with all those horrid
newspapers?

320
00:18:32,889 --> 00:18:35,928
We met at Cliveden.
But how old is he?

321
00:18:35,929 --> 00:18:38,448
Old enough not to ask
stupid questions.

322
00:18:38,449 --> 00:18:40,648
Anyway, I can't wait for you to know
him.

323
00:18:40,649 --> 00:18:43,009
If only Papa hadn't closed down
the shoot.

324
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:47,209
Most people have stopped shooting
now that the war's on.

325
00:18:47,809 --> 00:18:51,608
But I'm sure Papa would be happy to
have Sir Richard come and stay.

326
00:18:51,609 --> 00:18:54,968
Are you? I shouldn't have thought
he was Papa's type at all.

327
00:18:54,969 --> 00:18:57,489
Are you coming?
I'll be down in a minute.

328
00:19:11,529 --> 00:19:13,529
Are you all right, M'Lady?

329
00:19:16,009 --> 00:19:18,009
Oh, Anna...

330
00:19:49,289 --> 00:19:51,328
It's awfully grand.

331
00:19:51,329 --> 00:19:53,168
You'd better get used to it.

332
00:19:53,169 --> 00:19:55,088
It'll be your home one day.

333
00:19:55,089 --> 00:19:58,248
I'm not sure 'home' would ever be
quite the word to describe it.

334
00:19:58,249 --> 00:20:02,048
My dear fellow, welcome back.
It's so very good to see you.

335
00:20:02,049 --> 00:20:04,128
May I present Miss Lavinia Swire?

336
00:20:04,129 --> 00:20:06,928
How do you do, Lord Grantham.
How do you do, Miss Swire.

337
00:20:06,929 --> 00:20:10,448
So... that's Mary's replacement.

338
00:20:10,449 --> 00:20:13,728
Well, I suppose looks aren't
everything.

339
00:20:13,729 --> 00:20:15,729
I think she seems rather sweet.

340
00:20:16,689 --> 00:20:20,129
I'm afraid meeting us all together
must be very intimidating.

341
00:20:20,809 --> 00:20:22,969
I do hope so.

342
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:41,608
Now, please come this way.
Thank you.

343
00:20:41,609 --> 00:20:43,609
It's good to see you.

344
00:20:44,769 --> 00:20:47,249
Hello, Miss Swire, I'm Mary Crawley.

345
00:20:47,929 --> 00:20:51,128
Of course you are. I mean,
I've been longing to meet you

346
00:20:51,129 --> 00:20:53,648
because I've heard so much about you
from Matthew.

347
00:20:53,649 --> 00:20:55,889
Oh, that is...
Nice things, I hope.

348
00:20:56,409 --> 00:20:58,169
What else would she hear from me?

349
00:20:58,769 --> 00:21:00,769
Please.

350
00:21:01,569 --> 00:21:04,449
I can't say.
It's been such a long time.

351
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:06,928
Who knows what you think of me now?

352
00:21:06,929 --> 00:21:08,808
I think...

353
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:11,529
I'm very glad to see you looking
so well.

354
00:21:13,329 --> 00:21:15,368
All right, you win.

355
00:21:15,369 --> 00:21:17,408
We are at peace again.

356

(ORCHESTRA STARTS PLAYING)

357
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:45,768
Have you found something nice?

358
00:21:45,769 --> 00:21:47,529
Why, particularly?

359
00:21:48,369 --> 00:21:51,248
As a welcome home for Mr Matthew.

360
00:21:51,249 --> 00:21:53,288
(GRUNTS)
Oh, what's the matter?

361
00:21:53,289 --> 00:21:55,169
I'm thought you'd come round to him.

362
00:21:55,170 --> 00:21:58,408
Last time he was here, he hadn't
broken Lady Mary's heart.

363
00:21:58,409 --> 00:22:00,969
Lady Mary broke her own heart.

364
00:22:01,849 --> 00:22:04,448
That's if she has a heart to break.

365
00:22:04,449 --> 00:22:08,008
I don't think we're ever going to see
eye to eye on this, Mrs Hughes.

366
00:22:08,009 --> 00:22:10,768
She refused him when she thought
he'd have nothing.

367
00:22:10,769 --> 00:22:13,168
And when he was heir again,
she wanted him back.

368
00:22:13,169 --> 00:22:15,168
I thought caution was a virtue.

369
00:22:15,169 --> 00:22:18,289
Caution may be, self interest is
not.

370
00:22:19,449 --> 00:22:22,728
Perhaps Miss Swire is a gentler
person.

371
00:22:22,729 --> 00:22:25,128
If you ask me, this Miss Swire,

372

who, it may interest you to know,
is not to be found in Burke's Peerage

or Burke's Landed Gentry, has an eye
to the main chance.

374
00:22:32,969 --> 00:22:35,088
That's not snobbish, I suppose.

375
00:22:35,089 --> 00:22:37,448
I like to see things done properly,
Mrs Hughes,

376
00:22:37,449 --> 00:22:39,488
and I won't apologise for that.

377
00:22:39,489 --> 00:22:41,489
Now, if you'll excuse me.

378
00:22:54,169 --> 00:22:57,208
What is it?
A white feather, of course.

379
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:59,209
Coward.

380
00:23:00,169 --> 00:23:02,328
Stop this at once!
(ORCHESTRA HALTS ABRUPTLY)

This is neither the time
nor the place.

382

These people should be aware
that there are cowards among them.

Will you please leave?
You are the cowards here, not they!

I'm in a uniform.
Wrong kind.

387
00:23:42,209 --> 00:23:45,488
That was horrid, William.
I hope you won't let it upset you.

388
00:23:45,489 --> 00:23:47,328
No, Your Ladyship.

389
00:23:47,329 --> 00:23:49,328
Why are these women so unkind?

390
00:23:49,329 --> 00:23:51,048
Of course it is horrid,

391
00:23:51,049 --> 00:23:53,367
but when heroes are giving their
lives every day,

392

it's hard to watch healthy,
young men do nothing.

393
00:23:57,769 --> 00:24:00,688
By the way, Sybil, very good news,
they do have a vacancy.

394
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:03,768
It's very short notice,
because someone dropped out.

395
00:24:03,769 --> 00:24:05,928
You'd have to be ready to start
on Friday.

396
00:24:05,929 --> 00:24:07,889
May I ask what this is about?

397
00:24:08,369 --> 00:24:11,689
Cousin Isobel has got me a place on
a nursing course in York.

398
00:24:14,769 --> 00:24:16,769
I want to work at the hospital.

399
00:24:18,449 --> 00:24:20,449
We don't have to talk about it now.

400
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:26,368
She just turned up at my mother's
house.

401
00:24:26,369 --> 00:24:28,369
Not long before she died.

402
00:24:29,449 --> 00:24:31,849
So... what does it mean?

403
00:24:32,489 --> 00:24:36,008
I think it means, at long last...

404
00:24:36,009 --> 00:24:38,009
I'm able to get a divorce.

405
00:24:41,449 --> 00:24:44,008
Mr Bates...

406
00:24:44,009 --> 00:24:46,009
is this a proposal?

407
00:24:46,929 --> 00:24:48,929
If that's what you want to call it.

408
00:24:50,249 --> 00:24:52,249
And you might start calling me John.

409
00:24:54,569 --> 00:24:58,289
Well, why are you sure she'll do it
now, when she's refused for so long?

410
00:24:58,769 --> 00:25:01,688
Mother left me some money, much more
than I thought.

411
00:25:01,689 --> 00:25:05,048
Vera's a greedy woman, she won't
refuse what I can offer her.

412
00:25:05,049 --> 00:25:07,088
Will we have to leave Downton?

413

Not until we want to.
I've spoken to His Lordship

414
00:25:09,969 --> 00:25:12,169
and he will find a cottage for us
near the house.

415
00:25:13,329 --> 00:25:15,649
You told him you want to marry me?
I did.

416
00:25:16,609 --> 00:25:18,609
Before you spoke to me?

417
00:25:20,129 --> 00:25:22,688
You don't mind, do you?
Of course I mind!

418
00:25:22,689 --> 00:25:24,408
In fact, I'd give you a smack

I could burst.

Oh, how delicious, I love these.

423
00:26:00,951 --> 00:26:03,110
How did you and Matthew meet?

424
00:26:03,111 --> 00:26:07,070
Oh, in London. My father works in
London, so I've always lived there.

425
00:26:07,071 --> 00:26:09,710
But I love the country, too.
Of course you do.

426
00:26:09,711 --> 00:26:12,350
Daddy's a solicitor, like Matthew.

427

My, my. You're very well placed if
you're ever in trouble with the law.

Did I tell you I've been given
a colonelcy

429
00:26:19,511 --> 00:26:21,470
in the North Riding Volunteers?

430
00:26:21,471 --> 00:26:23,510
So I'm properly in the army again.

431
00:26:23,511 --> 00:26:25,511
Oh, congratulations.

432
00:26:27,231 --> 00:26:29,111
Yeah...
He won't go with them, will he?

433
00:26:29,112 --> 00:26:30,870
When they're called to the front.

434
00:26:30,871 --> 00:26:33,311
I hope not, but he seems to think
so.

435
00:26:36,311 --> 00:26:38,311
What's it been like?

436
00:26:44,071 --> 00:26:45,751
Do you know, the thing is...

437
00:26:48,791 --> 00:26:50,791
I just can't talk about it.

438

Have you missed us?

439
00:26:55,431 --> 00:26:57,431
What do you think?

440
00:27:03,271 --> 00:27:05,231
You don't mind my bringing Lavinia?

441
00:27:06,111 --> 00:27:08,190
On the contrary, I'm glad.

442
00:27:08,191 --> 00:27:09,951
Glad to see you happy.

443
00:27:12,471 --> 00:27:15,390
What about you? Are you happy?

444
00:27:15,391 --> 00:27:18,951
I think I'm about to be happy.
Does that count?

445
00:27:20,231 --> 00:27:22,270
It does if you mean it.

446
00:27:22,271 --> 00:27:24,271
You'll be the first to know.

447
00:27:30,711 --> 00:27:32,711
What are reading?

448
00:27:33,231 --> 00:27:35,231
A photoplay about Mabel Normand.

449
00:27:35,991 --> 00:27:38,391
She was nothing when she started,
you know.

450
00:27:38,951 --> 00:27:41,430
Her father was a carpenter and
they'd no money.

451
00:27:41,431 --> 00:27:43,350
And now she's a shining film star.

452
00:27:43,351 --> 00:27:46,471
Ethel, I've a message for you
from Her Ladyship.

453
00:27:47,151 --> 00:27:49,230
You're to go up and she her now.

454
00:27:49,231 --> 00:27:51,430
What where?
In the drawing room, of course.

455
00:27:51,431 --> 00:27:54,030
They're all in the drawing room.
What have I done wrong?

456
00:27:54,031 --> 00:27:56,070
Nothing. Quite the reverse.

457
00:27:56,071 --> 00:27:58,190
She's very pleased with the way
you've begun

458
00:27:58,191 --> 00:27:59,990
and she wants to thank you.

459
00:27:59,991 --> 00:28:01,950
Now?
Yes, now.

460
00:28:01,951 --> 00:28:05,711
She's asked for you. How much longer
are you going to keep her waiting?

461
00:28:14,231 --> 00:28:16,390
I don't know much about
life in the country,

462
00:28:16,391 --> 00:28:18,231
but I do understand
how the law works,

463
00:28:18,232 --> 00:28:20,430
so I believe I can be helpful
to Matthew there.

464
00:28:20,431 --> 00:28:22,670
But you'll be immensely helpful.

465
00:28:22,671 --> 00:28:25,231
Don't you think so, Mary?
Of course.

466
00:28:29,111 --> 00:28:33,110
I beg your pardon, M'Lady,
for keeping you waiting. What?

467
00:28:33,111 --> 00:28:35,470
I'm ever so grateful for your
appreciation

468
00:28:35,471 --> 00:28:38,031
and I want you to know that it's
a privilege to work here.

469
00:28:42,831 --> 00:28:44,831
Ethel, what are you doing in here?

470
00:28:45,351 --> 00:28:47,351
Er... Her Ladyship sent for me.

471
00:28:48,231 --> 00:28:50,390
And who gave you this message?

472
00:28:50,391 --> 00:28:53,670
Miss O'Brien. She said I wasn't to
keep Her Ladyship waiting.

473
00:28:53,671 --> 00:28:56,430
You may go back downstairs now,
thank you, Ethel.

474
00:28:56,431 --> 00:28:58,390
Right.

475
00:28:58,391 --> 00:29:00,271
Thank you, M'Lady.

476
00:29:00,871 --> 00:29:02,910
Well...

477
00:29:02,911 --> 00:29:06,791
do we think she's mad, ill
or working for the Russians?

478
00:29:10,991 --> 00:29:12,910
She has plenty of time to learn.

479
00:29:12,911 --> 00:29:15,790
Cousin Robert will be in charge here
for many years.

480
00:29:15,791 --> 00:29:19,430
Lavinia will be a lawyer's wife far
longer than she'll be a countess.

481
00:29:19,431 --> 00:29:21,751
That's if I get through the war in
one piece.

482
00:29:22,271 --> 00:29:25,071
Of course you will.
Don't even think like that.

483
00:29:26,511 --> 00:29:29,150
How long are you staying in the
village? Just tomorrow.

484
00:29:29,151 --> 00:29:31,190
I take the six o'clock train on
Thursday.

485
00:29:31,191 --> 00:29:33,430
And then you'll be in France.

486
00:29:33,431 --> 00:29:37,431
Wherever I'm going, I'm so pleased
that we're friends again.

487
00:29:44,111 --> 00:29:47,551
I still don't understand why it was
funny to make me look a fool.

488
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:50,590
You weren't even there to enjoy it.
Oh, don't worry.

489
00:29:50,591 --> 00:29:52,750
We enjoyed it all right from down
here.

490
00:29:52,751 --> 00:29:56,430
Miss O'Brien, Her Ladyship has asked
me to take the incident no further.

491
00:29:56,431 --> 00:29:58,430
Don't tempt me to disobey.

492
00:29:58,431 --> 00:30:00,990
Did I see Lady Sybil in the kitchen
yesterday?

493
00:30:00,991 --> 00:30:02,710
She wants to learn some cooking.

494
00:30:02,711 --> 00:30:04,710
She says she's going to train to be
a nurse,

495
00:30:04,711 --> 00:30:07,390
so she needs to know how to cook
and clean and everything.

496
00:30:07,391 --> 00:30:10,710
Has she told Her Ladyship about this?
It's supposed to be a surprise.

497
00:30:10,711 --> 00:30:12,750
Mr Carson, it speaks well
of Lady Sybil

498
00:30:12,751 --> 00:30:15,871
that she wants to help the wounded.
Let's not give her away.

499
00:30:16,911 --> 00:30:19,190
Why shouldn't she learn how to cook
and scrub?

500
00:30:19,191 --> 00:30:21,031
She may need it when the war's over.

501
00:30:21,032 --> 00:30:23,990
Things are changing,
for her lot and us.

502
00:30:23,991 --> 00:30:26,390
And when they do, I mean to make
the most of it.

503
00:30:26,391 --> 00:30:28,391
(MRS PATMORE SNIGGERS)

504
00:30:29,191 --> 00:30:32,070
I take it they ate all the pancakes
last night, then?

505
00:30:32,071 --> 00:30:34,071
They did.

506
00:30:38,231 --> 00:30:40,231
(WHISTLES)

507
00:30:40,751 --> 00:30:42,751
Here you are.

508
00:30:45,391 --> 00:30:47,230
What are we aiming at?

509
00:30:47,231 --> 00:30:49,590
They'd like us to take 100 wounded
men.

510
00:30:49,591 --> 00:30:52,231
Three times the number the hospital
was built for.

511
00:30:52,671 --> 00:30:56,190
Well, that settles it. We'll have to
convert the second day room.

512
00:30:56,191 --> 00:30:58,470
So there's to be no convalescence at
all?

513
00:30:58,471 --> 00:31:01,510
I'm afraid not. Once they can stand,
they must go.

514
00:31:01,511 --> 00:31:04,830
If only there was somewhere nearer
than Farley Hall.

515
00:31:04,831 --> 00:31:07,631
I can't get there more than twice
a week at the most.

516
00:31:09,791 --> 00:31:11,791
Ah, should he be doing that?

517
00:31:13,311 --> 00:31:15,910
Why not?
I only meant with his condition.

518
00:31:15,911 --> 00:31:18,390
What condition is that?
His lungs.

519
00:31:18,391 --> 00:31:21,670
Old Lady Grantham told me he's had
a lot of trouble with his lungs.

520
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:24,150
And why did she tell you that,
particularly?

521
00:31:24,151 --> 00:31:26,390
She wanted me to write to the
War Office.

522
00:31:26,391 --> 00:31:28,510
She was anxious to spare him the
humiliation

523
00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:30,351
of being refused on medical grounds.

524
00:31:30,352 --> 00:31:33,190
And who else did she wish you to
take under your protection?

525
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:35,631
William Mason, the footman at
the big house.

526
00:31:36,711 --> 00:31:40,351
He has a bad skin condition,
apparently, and hates people to know.

527
00:31:43,191 --> 00:31:45,871
She wanted to spare him the physical
examination.

528
00:31:46,591 --> 00:31:48,431
I'm sure she did.

529
00:31:50,671 --> 00:31:52,991
What in Wonderland do you call that?!

530
00:31:53,831 --> 00:31:57,670
I mean, I do not fully understand
what you're trying to do, M'Lady.

531
00:31:57,671 --> 00:31:59,990
Oh, I knew it wasn't supposed to
look like this.

532
00:31:59,991 --> 00:32:02,190
No, M'Lady. I would go so far as to
say

533
00:32:02,191 --> 00:32:05,951
there is no food on the Earth
that is supposed to look like that.

534
00:32:09,871 --> 00:32:11,871
Why does everything go so lumpy?

535
00:32:12,511 --> 00:32:15,191
Tell you what, chuck it out and
we'll start again.

536
00:32:20,911 --> 00:32:24,271
I don't think we should sell your
mother's house, not yet.

537
00:32:25,431 --> 00:32:28,071
We could rent it out.
Then we can save.

538
00:32:29,471 --> 00:32:32,751
When I've some time off, I'll go up
to London and get it ready.

539
00:32:34,351 --> 00:32:36,351
Maybe I can come with you.

540
00:32:36,751 --> 00:32:38,551
We could do it together.

541
00:32:41,391 --> 00:32:43,511
I've got an idea,
that a bit later on...

542
00:32:45,551 --> 00:32:47,270
if we want to...

543
00:32:47,271 --> 00:32:49,591
if we want to start a family.

544
00:32:50,751 --> 00:32:54,630
I thought, when the time is right,
we might sell.

545
00:32:54,631 --> 00:32:57,510
And we could buy a small hotel.

546
00:32:57,511 --> 00:33:00,950
Just... just a little one.

547
00:33:00,951 --> 00:33:02,990
Maybe near here.

548
00:33:02,991 --> 00:33:06,471
Then we could work together and
have the children with us.

549
00:33:08,191 --> 00:33:10,871
What is it?
Nothing, it's just...

550
00:33:12,511 --> 00:33:14,550
in my whole life, I never thought

551
00:33:14,551 --> 00:33:16,951
I could be as happy
as I am at this moment.

552
00:33:55,391 --> 00:33:58,990
Don't worry, I haven't come to undo
your good work of the other night.

553
00:33:58,991 --> 00:34:00,990
You must have been up before
the servants.

554
00:34:00,991 --> 00:34:03,031
They were rather surprised to see me.

555
00:34:05,191 --> 00:34:07,191
I wanted to give you this.

556
00:34:07,751 --> 00:34:09,790
It's my lucky charm.

557
00:34:09,791 --> 00:34:11,630
I've had it always.

558
00:34:11,631 --> 00:34:14,511
So you must promise to bring it back,
without a scratch.

559
00:34:16,391 --> 00:34:19,111
Won't you need it?
Not as much as you.

560
00:34:20,351 --> 00:34:22,351
So look after it, please.

561
00:34:23,631 --> 00:34:26,390
I'll try not to be a hero,
if that's what you're afraid of.

562
00:34:26,391 --> 00:34:28,231
Just come back, safe and sound.

563
00:34:30,791 --> 00:34:33,351
Did you have a happy time yesterday?

564
00:34:34,791 --> 00:34:38,511
I showed Lavinia the places I like
most. To give her a few memories.

565
00:34:40,671 --> 00:34:42,631
Mary, if I don't come back -
But - No.

566
00:34:42,632 --> 00:34:44,430
If I don't.

567
00:34:44,431 --> 00:34:46,470
Then do remember how very glad I am

568
00:34:46,471 --> 00:34:48,630
that we made up when we had the
chance.

569
00:34:48,631 --> 00:34:50,670
I mean it.

570
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:52,591
You send me off to war a happy man.

571
00:34:56,231 --> 00:34:58,270
Will you do something for me?

572
00:34:58,271 --> 00:35:00,310
Will you...

573
00:35:00,311 --> 00:35:03,710
Will you look after Mother,
if anything happens?

574
00:35:03,711 --> 00:35:05,910
Of course we will, but it won't.

575
00:35:05,911 --> 00:35:07,630
And Lavinia.

576
00:35:07,631 --> 00:35:11,270
She's young, she'll find someone
else, I hop she does anyway.

577
00:35:11,271 --> 00:35:14,190
But... until she does.

578
00:35:14,191 --> 00:35:16,191
(WHISTLE)

579
00:35:17,391 --> 00:35:19,391
Goodbye, then.

580
00:35:22,271 --> 00:35:24,271
And such good luck.

581
00:35:25,231 --> 00:35:27,270
Goodbye, Mary.

582
00:35:27,271 --> 00:35:29,271
And God bless you.

583
00:36:14,735 --> 00:36:18,574
Lady Mary was very much part of the
story, I can assure you.

584
00:36:18,575 --> 00:36:20,454
But how do you know?

585
00:36:20,455 --> 00:36:22,975
Well, you see I worked for Lady Flin-
Ethel...

586
00:36:24,295 --> 00:36:26,695
I hope you've offered our visitor
some tea.

587
00:36:27,695 --> 00:36:29,695
I'll go and ask Daisy.

588
00:36:31,455 --> 00:36:33,454
What is the first law of service?

589
00:36:33,455 --> 00:36:36,694
We do not discuss the business of
this house with strangers.

590
00:36:36,695 --> 00:36:40,254
But she's not a stranger.
She's Mr Bates' wife.

591
00:36:40,255 --> 00:36:42,255
Has anyone told him she's here?

592
00:36:54,415 --> 00:36:56,454
So you're Anna.

593
00:36:56,455 --> 00:36:58,455
I am.

594
00:37:00,215 --> 00:37:03,974
You're the one who went to call on
my late, lamented mother-in-law.

595
00:37:03,975 --> 00:37:06,014
Yes, I did.

596
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:08,255
I know you did.

597
00:37:12,935 --> 00:37:14,815
Sorry to keep you waiting, Vera.

598
00:37:17,015 --> 00:37:19,694
I was up in the attics, sorting out
some cupboards.

599
00:37:19,695 --> 00:37:22,094
Don't worry. I've been having
a nice time

600
00:37:22,095 --> 00:37:24,215
here with Ethel and Miss Smith.

601
00:37:25,095 --> 00:37:28,774
Mr Bates, Ethel told me about your
visitor.

602
00:37:28,775 --> 00:37:31,014
So I've had the tea put in my
sitting room.

603
00:37:31,015 --> 00:37:33,255
I thought you might take Mrs Bates
in there.

604
00:37:34,015 --> 00:37:36,214
That's very thoughtful.
It is.

605
00:37:36,215 --> 00:37:39,295
But then you're all so kind.

606
00:37:40,255 --> 00:37:43,415
I'm beginning to understand why
my Batesy's got so spoiled.

607
00:37:50,655 --> 00:37:52,694
I'm sorry to trouble you, My Lady.

608
00:37:52,695 --> 00:37:55,774
What is it, Carson?
Something has been going on

609
00:37:55,775 --> 00:37:59,334
and I don't feel quite easy that
you've not been made aware of it.

610
00:37:59,335 --> 00:38:02,134
Goodness. What is this dark secret?

611
00:38:02,135 --> 00:38:06,494
Lady Sybil has spent
the last two days in the kitchen.

612
00:38:06,495 --> 00:38:10,174
What? She asked Mrs Patmore
for some cooking lessons.

613
00:38:10,175 --> 00:38:13,694
Now, steady. Even the most
experience cook can burn themself

614
00:38:13,695 --> 00:38:16,454
if they're not careful.
Do you think it's ready?

615
00:38:16,455 --> 00:38:19,655
I know it's ready.
Go on, you don't want to spoil it.

616
00:38:20,655 --> 00:38:24,654
It seems she's made a cake for
Your Ladyship, as a surprise.

617
00:38:24,655 --> 00:38:27,494
But I'm uneasy with surprises
at the best of times

618
00:38:27,495 --> 00:38:31,855
and I wonder if the whole exercise
is entirely appropriate. Ta-dah!

619
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:38,295
I'm not comfortable with this,
My Lady. Not comfortable at all.

620
00:38:40,295 --> 00:38:43,535
I was worried about Lady Sybil,
but I'm not worried any more.

621
00:38:44,535 --> 00:38:46,535
So you don't mind, My Lady?

622
00:38:48,255 --> 00:38:50,255
No.

623
00:38:50,895 --> 00:38:52,735
I do not mind.

624
00:38:53,455 --> 00:38:55,695
And I'm very grateful to you.

625
00:38:57,255 --> 00:39:00,934
And, Carson, the cake will be a
surprise whether you approve or not.

626
00:39:00,935 --> 00:39:02,935
So please don't give me away.

627
00:39:13,055 --> 00:39:15,535
Sit down.
I don't want to sit down.

628
00:39:16,455 --> 00:39:18,455
Suit yourself.

629
00:39:21,215 --> 00:39:24,894
Look, I'm not saying it's all your
fault for how things were between us.

630
00:39:24,895 --> 00:39:27,054
But I couldn't go back to that.

631
00:39:27,055 --> 00:39:30,695
I'll take the blame. I'll go to some
hotel in Malton with a tart.

632
00:39:33,135 --> 00:39:35,135
So why hold on?

633
00:39:35,575 --> 00:39:38,095
Because I tried it on my own
and I don't like it.

634
00:39:39,415 --> 00:39:41,815
You've got money now,
we'd be comfortable.

635
00:39:43,935 --> 00:39:45,814
You're out of your mind.

636
00:39:45,815 --> 00:39:48,414
What makes you think that I would
allow that to happen?

637
00:39:48,415 --> 00:39:50,415
You went to prison for me once.

638
00:39:53,615 --> 00:39:55,615
I must say, this is very good.

639
00:39:56,335 --> 00:39:58,494
Does Lord Grantham have his own
blend?

640
00:39:58,495 --> 00:40:00,815
Is that all?
Not quite.

641
00:40:02,415 --> 00:40:04,213
You see, if you don't come back to
me,

642
00:40:04,214 --> 00:40:06,655
I'm going to the newspapers with
a cracking story

643
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:09,254
and I'd like to bet the Grantham's
won't survive it.

644
00:40:09,255 --> 00:40:12,254
Oh? And what nonsense is this?

645
00:40:12,255 --> 00:40:14,294
The nonsense I heard when I used
your name

646
00:40:14,295 --> 00:40:17,094
to get a job with Lady Flintshire,
his Lordship's cousin.

647
00:40:17,095 --> 00:40:19,535
I know who Lady Flintshire is.
Well, when I arrived,

648
00:40:19,536 --> 00:40:21,254
her maid asked me if it was true.

649
00:40:21,255 --> 00:40:23,655
About Lady Mary Crawley and the
Turkish diplomat.

650
00:40:23,656 --> 00:40:25,934
They thought I'd know, you see,
being your wife.

651
00:40:25,935 --> 00:40:28,095
I hope you told them you knew nothing
about it.

652
00:40:30,295 --> 00:40:32,895
Oh... As if.

653
00:40:33,935 --> 00:40:36,974
I said, 'Why don't you tell me what
you think you know

654
00:40:36,975 --> 00:40:38,975
and I'll tell you if it's true.'

655
00:40:39,735 --> 00:40:41,774
Goodness me.

656
00:40:41,775 --> 00:40:43,814
Wasn't my patience rewarded.

657
00:40:43,815 --> 00:40:46,334
The public's bored with the war,
you see.

658
00:40:46,335 --> 00:40:48,254
They like gossip.

659
00:40:48,255 --> 00:40:51,574
And a diplomat dying in the bed of
an earl's unmarried daughter,

660
00:40:51,575 --> 00:40:55,054
well, that takes the ticket for the
tale of the year.

661
00:40:55,055 --> 00:40:58,854
It's a pack of lies! I assume
that's loyalty and not ignorance.

662
00:40:58,855 --> 00:41:01,094
Because, you see, I heard
that Lady Mary needed

663
00:41:01,095 --> 00:41:03,814
her maid to help her carry him and,
yes, you've guessed it,

664
00:41:03,815 --> 00:41:06,414
your precious Anna's going to figure
in the story, too.

665
00:41:06,415 --> 00:41:10,014
Not to worry too much.
It's not a criminal offence, is it?

666
00:41:10,015 --> 00:41:11,855
Just a social one.

667
00:41:15,455 --> 00:41:18,694
You bitch.
Please, be my guest.

668
00:41:18,695 --> 00:41:20,414
But then you must excuse me

669
00:41:20,415 --> 00:41:22,615
while I run into town and have it
photographed.

670
00:41:32,735 --> 00:41:34,734
What do you want from me?

671
00:41:34,735 --> 00:41:37,094
Firstly, hand in your notice...

672
00:41:37,095 --> 00:41:38,814
tonight.

673
00:41:38,815 --> 00:41:40,695
I'll put up at the pub in the
village.

674
00:41:40,696 --> 00:41:43,294
And what reason do I give?
You don't need a reason.

675
00:41:43,295 --> 00:41:45,334
Just tell them that you're going.

676
00:41:45,335 --> 00:41:47,614
And then tomorrow we head back to
London.

677
00:41:47,615 --> 00:41:50,095
We'll stay in your mother's house
for the time being,

678
00:41:50,096 --> 00:41:51,894
till we get ourselves sorted.

679
00:41:51,895 --> 00:41:55,335
And in case you're wondering,
whatever my future plans may be,

680
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:57,455
they will involve you.

681
00:42:13,015 --> 00:42:15,814
Bates, when you first came here,
I fought to keep you!

682
00:42:15,815 --> 00:42:19,174
Everyone was against me, everyone,
from Her Ladyship to Carson.

683
00:42:19,175 --> 00:42:21,454
They thought I was mad.
But I said to them,

684
00:42:21,455 --> 00:42:23,774
'After all that we've been through,
Bates and I,

685
00:42:23,775 --> 00:42:26,694
I owe him my loyalty!'
I appreciate that, M'Lord, but...

686
00:42:26,695 --> 00:42:30,534
But what? But loyalty doesn't matter
to you? It does matter, M'Lord.

687
00:42:30,535 --> 00:42:33,134
Not enough to make you change your
mind. Not even enough

688
00:42:33,135 --> 00:42:35,414
to make you stay until I've found
a replacement!

689
00:42:35,415 --> 00:42:38,694
I can't. You won't take any more
money off me. You leave empty-handed!

690
00:42:38,695 --> 00:42:40,695
I don't want money, M'Lord.

691
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:42,773
I'm sorry, Bates, that was a low
shot.

692
00:42:42,774 --> 00:42:45,095
Of course you can have whatever is
owning to you.

693
00:42:48,415 --> 00:42:50,535
I thought we were friends,
that's all.

694
00:42:51,855 --> 00:42:54,814
I thought we'd crossed the great
divide, successfully.

695
00:42:54,815 --> 00:42:57,854
Well, I've had my say,
it's your life.

696
00:42:57,855 --> 00:43:00,014
But you've disappointed me, Bates.

697
00:43:00,015 --> 00:43:03,215
I cannot remember being more
disappointed in any man.

698
00:43:06,655 --> 00:43:08,934
I don't believe it.
You say my life is over

699
00:43:08,935 --> 00:43:11,654
and your wife will collect you first
thing and that's it?

700
00:43:11,655 --> 00:43:13,894
Have you mentioned this to anyone
else?

701
00:43:13,895 --> 00:43:15,895
Only Mr Carson and Mrs Hughes.

702
00:43:16,375 --> 00:43:18,494
The others can find out when
I've gone.

703
00:43:18,495 --> 00:43:21,214
I know you've not told me the real
reason. You're wrong.

704
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:23,294
Vera has reminded me
that I'm a married man.

705
00:43:23,295 --> 00:43:25,055
I must give my vows another chance.

706
00:43:25,056 --> 00:43:27,734
I had not right to involve you in
my life. Yes, but you see,

707
00:43:27,735 --> 00:43:30,414
that's just what I don't agree with.
You had every right.

708
00:43:30,415 --> 00:43:33,294
I know you.
You're doing something gallant here,

709
00:43:33,295 --> 00:43:36,134
making a sacrifice for my honour,
but I don't want you to.

710
00:43:36,135 --> 00:43:38,174
I don't care. Don't you understand?

711
00:43:38,175 --> 00:43:40,214
I don't care what people say.

712
00:43:40,215 --> 00:43:42,254
I'd live in sin with you.

713
00:43:42,255 --> 00:43:45,934
If she's threatening to ruin me,
then let her. It's nothing to me.

714
00:43:45,935 --> 00:43:48,574
The only ruin that I recognise is to
be without you.

715
00:43:48,575 --> 00:43:50,334
Forget me and be happy, please.

716
00:43:50,335 --> 00:43:52,695
I couldn't. Not ever.

717
00:43:55,495 --> 00:43:58,295
You should and you must.

718
00:44:00,415 --> 00:44:02,415
I am nothing.

719
00:44:14,855 --> 00:44:17,095
William? I thought everyone had gone
up.

720
00:44:18,175 --> 00:44:21,215
I'm just looking for that magazine
Ethel were reading.

721
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:27,294
I hope you've noticed I'm not scared
of electricity any more.

722
00:44:27,295 --> 00:44:30,614
Well, not much. I couldn't touch
a switch when it were only upstairs,

723
00:44:30,615 --> 00:44:32,615
but I've got used to it now.

724
00:44:33,295 --> 00:44:35,295
I hate to see you like this.

725
00:44:35,935 --> 00:44:37,774
Even though I'm a dirty coward?

726
00:44:37,775 --> 00:44:39,814
You're not. Not to me.

727
00:44:39,815 --> 00:44:41,774
But why don't I enlist?

728
00:44:41,775 --> 00:44:43,814
I could.

729
00:44:43,815 --> 00:44:46,534
I know I promised my dad,
but he's not my owner.

730
00:44:46,535 --> 00:44:48,535
He's not the law.

731
00:44:49,455 --> 00:44:52,694
Am I frightened?
Is that it, honestly?

732
00:44:52,695 --> 00:44:54,734
Don't be so hard on yourself.

733
00:44:54,735 --> 00:44:56,735
No-one wants to go to war.

734
00:44:58,375 --> 00:45:01,455
Oh, I wish you'd cheer up, please.

735
00:45:02,415 --> 00:45:04,454
I'd do anything to cheer you up.

736
00:45:04,455 --> 00:45:06,455
Like what?

737
00:45:08,055 --> 00:45:10,055
Like this.

738
00:45:18,175 --> 00:45:19,934
You just feel sorry for me.

739
00:45:19,935 --> 00:45:21,974
William, I've kissed you!

740
00:45:21,975 --> 00:45:25,055
You've wanted me to long enough.
Well, now I have. Enjoy it.

741
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:28,694
Does this mean you'll be my girl?

742
00:45:28,695 --> 00:45:32,015
Daisy? Cos if you were my girl,
I know I could tackle anything.

743
00:45:47,615 --> 00:45:50,534
We were supposed to be at rest for
ten days at least.

744
00:45:50,535 --> 00:45:52,814
Orders arrived this morning, sir.

745
00:45:52,815 --> 00:45:55,855
The King's Own were hit bad,
so they're out and we're in.

746
00:45:56,455 --> 00:46:00,374
They've been shelling the trench
since we got here. Anybody hurt?

747
00:46:00,375 --> 00:46:03,855
Rankin's dead and
Kent and Corporal Wright was hit.

748
00:46:04,655 --> 00:46:06,974
Thank God the stretcher bearers were
there.

749
00:46:06,975 --> 00:46:09,015
Let's see what the damage is now.
Sir.

750
00:46:17,935 --> 00:46:19,775
All right?
Morning, sir.

751
00:46:26,375 --> 00:46:28,095
Look out!

752
00:46:34,055 --> 00:46:36,055
Medic!

753
00:46:36,775 --> 00:46:39,094
Thomas?

754
00:46:39,095 --> 00:46:42,215
It is Thomas, isn't it?
Corporal Barrow now, Mr Crawley.

755
00:46:44,015 --> 00:46:46,375
You'll never guess
where I've just been.

756
00:47:05,775 --> 00:47:10,254
Where's Anna? She's not feeling very
well today, Your Ladyship.

757
00:47:10,255 --> 00:47:12,334
I've taken over for the time being.

758
00:47:12,335 --> 00:47:14,374
Oh, that's so kind of you.

759
00:47:14,375 --> 00:47:16,774
Just make sure Lady Sybil packs
things

760
00:47:16,775 --> 00:47:19,214
she can get in and out of
without a maid.

761
00:47:19,215 --> 00:47:22,614
Oh, I don't need that.
I'd never wear it.

762
00:47:22,615 --> 00:47:25,934
But you must have something decent.
Suppose you're invited to dinner?

763
00:47:25,935 --> 00:47:27,655
I know this is hard for you to
grasp,

764
00:47:27,656 --> 00:47:30,254
but I'm not there to go out to
dinner. I'm there to learn.

765
00:47:30,255 --> 00:47:32,255
Take one, just in case.

766
00:47:33,615 --> 00:47:37,014
We'll miss you. Don't be silly,
it's only two months.

767
00:47:37,015 --> 00:47:39,054
And I'll come home if I can.

768
00:47:39,055 --> 00:47:42,894
Why don't I drive you? She's taking
enough chance with her life as it is.

769
00:47:42,895 --> 00:47:44,934
Oh, Granny.

770
00:47:44,935 --> 00:47:48,334
What is this driving mania?
It'll be useful.

771
00:47:48,335 --> 00:47:51,654
They won't let a healthy man drive
us around for much longer.

772
00:47:51,655 --> 00:47:54,454
And if Sybil can be a nurse,
why can't I be a chauffeur?

773
00:47:54,455 --> 00:47:56,934
Well, I shall leave you.

774
00:47:56,935 --> 00:48:00,815
I have been summoned by Cousin Isobel
for tea.

775
00:48:01,695 --> 00:48:04,814
Goodbye, Sybil.
And good luck with it all.

776
00:48:04,815 --> 00:48:06,735
Thank you for being such a sport.

777
00:48:07,415 --> 00:48:09,855
It's a big step you're taking, dear.

778
00:48:10,615 --> 00:48:14,055
But war deals out strange tasks.

779
00:48:14,695 --> 00:48:16,695
Remember your great aunt, Roberta.

780
00:48:17,135 --> 00:48:18,894
What about her?

781
00:48:18,895 --> 00:48:22,055
She loaded the guns at Lucknow.

782
00:48:23,615 --> 00:48:26,575
I'll come with you.
I'll tell William to fetch the bags.

783
00:48:29,135 --> 00:48:31,135
The first of you to leave the nest.

784
00:48:33,015 --> 00:48:36,494
Poor Mama. She always feels
these things so dreadfully.

785
00:48:36,495 --> 00:48:38,534
That's her American blood.

786
00:48:38,535 --> 00:48:41,734
I'm so glad we've settled everything
with Cousin Matthew.

787
00:48:41,735 --> 00:48:44,934
Aren't you, Mary? Oh, please
stop treading on eggshells.

788
00:48:44,935 --> 00:48:46,935
I've other fish to fry.

789
00:49:20,039 --> 00:49:22,078
I make no apology.

790
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:26,718
It would be a terrible thing if poor,
old Mr Molesley's son were killed.

791
00:49:26,719 --> 00:49:29,038
Wouldn't it, Molesley?
I'm sure it would, but...

792
00:49:29,039 --> 00:49:32,278
And then I heard William's father

793
00:49:32,279 --> 00:49:35,799
would be left on his own if anything
happened to the boy.

794
00:49:36,399 --> 00:49:39,918
And what would become of Carson if
the last of his staff were to go?

795
00:49:39,919 --> 00:49:42,598
That's not the point.
Do you want Molesley to die?

796
00:49:42,599 --> 00:49:44,318
Of course I don't!
Well.

797
00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:46,279
I don't want my own son to die,
either.

798
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:48,718
But this is a war and we must be in
it together!

799
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:50,598
High and low, rich and poor.

800
00:49:50,599 --> 00:49:52,718
There can be no special cases,

801
00:49:52,719 --> 00:49:56,158
because every man at the front
is a special case to someone.

802
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:57,878
Mrs Crawley is right.

803
00:49:57,879 --> 00:49:59,958
I understand your motives,
Lady Grantham,

804
00:49:59,959 --> 00:50:01,678
and I do not criticise them.

805
00:50:01,679 --> 00:50:05,078
Thank you. But I shall write
to the Ministry at once,

806
00:50:05,079 --> 00:50:07,198
correcting the misinformation.

807
00:50:07,199 --> 00:50:09,039
Good day. I'll see myself out.

808
00:50:10,279 --> 00:50:12,758
Molesley, you understand why I said
what I did?

809
00:50:12,759 --> 00:50:14,559
Indeed. I do, ma'am.

810
00:50:16,279 --> 00:50:18,518
You won't be called up at once.

811
00:50:18,519 --> 00:50:20,958
Not while there are younger men to
be taken.

812
00:50:20,959 --> 00:50:23,879
But they'll get you in the end,
Molesley.

813
00:50:25,279 --> 00:50:27,879
And you can blame Mrs Crawley
when they do.

814
00:50:31,399 --> 00:50:34,559
I wish you'd stop working
for one minute.

815
00:50:35,239 --> 00:50:38,359
At least put the light on,
or you'll strain your eyes.

816
00:50:39,959 --> 00:50:42,479
It's getting dark so early now.

817
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:45,919
Has she gone?
She has.

818
00:50:46,719 --> 00:50:50,798
So... we've lost Mr Bates
and Lady Sybil in one day.

819
00:50:50,799 --> 00:50:52,878
I can't believe it.

820
00:50:52,879 --> 00:50:55,359
I suppose I'll have to look after
His Lordship now,

821
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:57,878
on top of everything else.
And I don't want any jokes

822
00:50:57,879 --> 00:51:00,279
about broomsticks and sweeping
the floor.

823
00:51:00,999 --> 00:51:04,398
His Lordship's got his regimental
dinner in Richmond tonight.

824
00:51:04,399 --> 00:51:06,999
That means he'll be in the full fig.
You'll manage.

825
00:51:08,279 --> 00:51:11,078
You know, when Mr Bates first came
to this house,

826
00:51:11,079 --> 00:51:13,039
I thought he could never do the work.

827
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:15,518
But now I can't imagine the place
without him.

828
00:51:15,519 --> 00:51:17,639
Did you see this coming?
Because I didn't.

829
00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:20,358
I have a confession.

830
00:51:20,359 --> 00:51:22,798
I let them have their tea
in my sitting room.

831
00:51:22,799 --> 00:51:25,798
That was nice of you.
It was quite nice.

832
00:51:25,799 --> 00:51:27,799
But I had my reasons.

833
00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:32,238
There's a grating on the wall

834
00:51:32,239 --> 00:51:35,079
which means you can hear what's
being said in the room.

835
00:51:36,159 --> 00:51:39,078
Now if I was a gentleman,
I wouldn't want to know.

836
00:51:39,079 --> 00:51:41,118
But you're not.

837
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:43,119
Fortunately.

838
00:52:07,199 --> 00:52:09,078
It'll be hard to let you go.

839
00:52:09,079 --> 00:52:10,799
My last link with home.

840
00:52:11,879 --> 00:52:13,839
Not as hard as it is for me.

841
00:52:14,519 --> 00:52:18,078
Branson - I know I shouldn't say it,
but I can't keep it in any longer.

842
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:21,518
I wish you would. I told myself and
told myself, you're too far above me.

843
00:52:21,519 --> 00:52:23,718
But things are changing.
When the war is over,

844
00:52:23,719 --> 00:52:26,438
the world won't be the same place
as it was when it started.

845
00:52:26,439 --> 00:52:29,398
And I'll make something of myself,
I promise. I know you will.

846
00:52:29,399 --> 00:52:31,838
Then bet on me.

847
00:52:31,839 --> 00:52:34,558
And if your family casts you off,
it won't be forever.

848
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:37,998
They'll come around.
And until they do,

849
00:52:37,999 --> 00:52:41,999
I promise to devote every waking
minute to your happiness.

850
00:52:43,879 --> 00:52:46,158
I'm terribly flattered.

851
00:52:46,159 --> 00:52:48,599
Don't say that.
Why not?

852
00:52:49,559 --> 00:52:51,798
Because 'flattered' is a word posh
people use

853
00:52:51,799 --> 00:52:53,599
when they're getting ready to say no.

854
00:52:55,079 --> 00:52:57,278
That sounds more like you.

855
00:52:57,279 --> 00:52:59,318
Please don't make fun of me.

856
00:52:59,319 --> 00:53:03,159
No. It's cost me all I've got
to say these things.

857
00:53:09,719 --> 00:53:11,719
Right.

858
00:53:12,759 --> 00:53:14,638
I'll go. I'll hand in my notice

859
00:53:14,639 --> 00:53:17,558
and I won't be there when you get
back - No, don't do that.

860
00:53:17,559 --> 00:53:20,919
I must. They won't let me stay
when they've heard what I've said.

861
00:53:22,319 --> 00:53:24,319
They won't hear.

862
00:53:25,079 --> 00:53:27,079
Not from me.

863
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:39,679
Bloody hell.
There must be more to life than this.

864
00:53:46,759 --> 00:53:48,759
You all right, Corporal?

865
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:54,719
I think so. Yeah, more or less.

866
00:54:03,439 --> 00:54:05,478
My God.

867
00:54:05,479 --> 00:54:08,238
They won't believe it back home
where I come from.

868
00:54:08,239 --> 00:54:12,198
I thought, 'Medical Corps,
not much danger there.'

869
00:54:12,199 --> 00:54:14,199
How wrong can one man be?

870
00:54:15,439 --> 00:54:17,439
Here.

871
00:54:17,799 --> 00:54:19,958
I think it comes down to luck.

872
00:54:19,959 --> 00:54:23,638
If a bullet's got your name on it,
there's nothing you can do.

873
00:54:23,639 --> 00:54:26,999
If not, then thank God you were
lucky...

874
00:54:33,239 --> 00:54:35,239
Get these bodies away!

875
00:54:36,199 --> 00:54:38,199
Come on, Corporal Barrow!

876
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:49,358
I cannot tell you how pleased I am to
be here tonight, sir.

877
00:54:49,359 --> 00:54:51,799
Oh, we are very pleased to have you
here, Grantham.

878
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:55,599
You see, just to know that I'm with
you all, to sense that I belong here.

879
00:54:56,879 --> 00:54:59,719
It's as simple as this,
I no longer feel like a fraud.

880
00:55:04,359 --> 00:55:06,758
Mr Molesley, what are you doing
here?

881
00:55:06,759 --> 00:55:09,638
I was waiting to see you, Doctor.
How can I help?

882
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:12,638
It's just I was wondering whether
you'd written that letter.

883
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:15,558
The one you spoke of this afternoon.
To the War Office?

884
00:55:15,559 --> 00:55:18,238
Not yet. I'm sorry
you were involved in all that.

885
00:55:18,239 --> 00:55:21,038
I should've checked with you first,
before I interfered.

886
00:55:21,039 --> 00:55:23,798
That's just it. You see, I think if
you had checked with me,

887
00:55:23,799 --> 00:55:26,478
you'd have found exactly what
Lady Grantham described.

888
00:55:26,479 --> 00:55:28,718
I don't quite...
I have trouble with my lungs.

889
00:55:28,719 --> 00:55:30,758
I get so...

890
00:55:30,759 --> 00:55:32,798
breathless sometimes.

891
00:55:32,799 --> 00:55:34,838
And...

892
00:55:34,839 --> 00:55:37,359
I've noticed it's getting worse.

893
00:55:41,999 --> 00:55:45,438
They haven't written to William yet.

894
00:55:45,439 --> 00:55:48,679
The Ministry, I mean.
But they have discharged me.

895
00:55:50,319 --> 00:55:52,159
Won't it just make extra work for
them

896
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:53,959
to have to fail me all over again?

897
00:55:54,439 --> 00:55:56,478
Very well.

898
00:55:56,479 --> 00:55:59,238
I shall correct my statement as
regards William,

899
00:55:59,239 --> 00:56:01,719
but make no mention of you.
Thank you, Doctor.

900
00:56:02,959 --> 00:56:04,998
It's all right.

901
00:56:04,999 --> 00:56:07,038
But, Molesley...

902
00:56:07,039 --> 00:56:10,519
I hope you will help the war effort,
in other ways.

903
00:56:14,239 --> 00:56:17,238
When might the regiment be wanted,
sir?

904
00:56:17,239 --> 00:56:19,598
The talk at dinner suggested
it would be soon.

905
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:21,638
Oh, pretty soon, I'd say.

906
00:56:21,639 --> 00:56:25,279
Well, I'm as ready now
as I'll ever be.

907
00:56:26,599 --> 00:56:29,678
For what?
To go to France, with the regiment.

908
00:56:29,679 --> 00:56:31,718
Why would you do that?

909
00:56:31,719 --> 00:56:33,878
Because I'm their colonel, of course.

910
00:56:33,879 --> 00:56:36,158
Well, there must be some use for me
over there.

911
00:56:36,159 --> 00:56:39,158
My dear fellow, we're not as
heartless as that!

912
00:56:39,159 --> 00:56:43,239
The position's only an honorary one.
Nobody expects you to go to war.

913
00:56:43,999 --> 00:56:46,878
An honorary one? We thought
it'd cheer things up a bit

914
00:56:46,879 --> 00:56:49,158
to have the Lord Lieutenant
at our table.

915
00:56:49,159 --> 00:56:51,919
And so it does. We're very glad
to welcome to you here.

916
00:56:53,479 --> 00:56:57,238
I see. We old codgers
have our work cut out for us

917
00:56:57,239 --> 00:57:00,078
keeping spirits high at home.
Someone must.

918
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:03,278
Oh, indeed, sir.
Is that Taxi Cavendish?

919
00:57:03,279 --> 00:57:05,279
I must catch him before I go.

920
00:57:19,474 --> 00:57:21,714
So Lady Sybil got off all right in
the end.

921
00:57:22,594 --> 00:57:25,433
I'm afraid we have to admit
she knows what she wants.

922
00:57:25,434 --> 00:57:27,353
Yes. She certainly does.

923
00:57:27,354 --> 00:57:29,714
I don't suppose the war will leave
any of us alone

924
00:57:29,715 --> 00:57:31,554
by the time it's done.

925
00:57:32,234 --> 00:57:34,473
I got a letter from Thomas the other
day.

926
00:57:34,474 --> 00:57:37,273
He writes that when he thinks about
how things used to be,

927
00:57:37,274 --> 00:57:39,274
it seems like a dream.

928
00:57:39,994 --> 00:57:41,954
It's not much more than two years
ago,

929
00:57:41,955 --> 00:57:44,073
but he says it might as well be a
century.

930
00:57:44,074 --> 00:57:46,514
So you hear from Thomas. Is he well?

931
00:57:46,994 --> 00:57:49,033
Please give him my regards.

932
00:57:49,034 --> 00:57:51,034
He's well enough, M'Lady.

933
00:57:51,834 --> 00:57:54,073
But I don't think he'd mind coming
home.

934
00:57:54,074 --> 00:57:56,074
Oh, how I wish he could, O'Brien.

935
00:57:57,794 --> 00:58:00,234
Of course, if Bates hadn't been so
bloody selfish,

936
00:58:00,235 --> 00:58:03,193
he would have let us plan for his
departure properly.

937
00:58:03,194 --> 00:58:07,913
Your Lordship, I have information
that I have no proper claim to.

938
00:58:07,914 --> 00:58:09,953
Well, what is it?

939
00:58:09,954 --> 00:58:13,913
Well, if Your Lordship can assure me
that you will keep it to yourself?

940
00:58:13,914 --> 00:58:17,554
I promise, Carson.
You can drop the last veil.

941
00:58:18,714 --> 00:58:21,153
Well, I feel it only right to tell
you

942
00:58:21,154 --> 00:58:23,873
that Mr Bates' leaving was not
selfish.

943
00:58:23,874 --> 00:58:26,594
Quite the reverse.
It felt selfish to me.

944
00:58:27,594 --> 00:58:30,994
As for the wretched Anna,
bedizened with dishonest promises.

945
00:58:32,074 --> 00:58:34,833
Mr Bates left because had he not
done so,

946
00:58:34,834 --> 00:58:38,513
his wife was planning to engulf
this house in scandal.

947
00:58:38,514 --> 00:58:40,514
Scandal?

948
00:58:41,754 --> 00:58:43,753
What scandal?
The point is, My Lord,

949
00:58:43,754 --> 00:58:46,313
Mrs Bates would have made Downton
notorious.

950
00:58:46,314 --> 00:58:49,873
The price of her silence was her
husband's return.

951
00:58:49,874 --> 00:58:52,713
But I must know what story she was
planning to tell.

952
00:58:52,714 --> 00:58:54,833
I'm sorry, My Lord,
I could not speak of it

953
00:58:54,834 --> 00:58:57,114
without injuring you and
betraying myself.

954
00:58:58,074 --> 00:59:00,633
But you are saying that Bates
fell on his sword

955
00:59:00,634 --> 00:59:02,834
to protect the reputation
of my family?

956
00:59:16,914 --> 00:59:18,914
Ethel, what are you doing?

957
00:59:19,594 --> 00:59:21,633
Seeing to the plugs for the night.

958
00:59:21,634 --> 00:59:25,233
What? Polishing the electric plugs
and checking them for vapours.

959
00:59:25,234 --> 00:59:27,273
And why are you doing this?

960
00:59:27,274 --> 00:59:29,313
Because you were too busy.

961
00:59:29,314 --> 00:59:32,473
She said you usually did it,
but could I manage it tonight.

962
00:59:32,474 --> 00:59:35,434
And 'she', I take it,
would be Miss O'Brien?

963
00:59:37,674 --> 00:59:39,553
Go to bed, Ethel.

964
00:59:39,554 --> 00:59:43,114
Next time she gives you an order,
ask me first.

965
00:59:50,954 --> 00:59:53,753
Is anything the matter?
Nothing.

966
00:59:53,754 --> 00:59:57,673
Except that today has shown me
I'm not only a worthless man,

967
00:59:57,674 --> 01:00:00,153
but also a bad-tempered and
ungrateful one.

968
01:00:00,154 --> 01:00:02,154
Well, we all know that.

969
01:00:05,594 --> 01:00:07,594
Can I help?

970
01:00:11,354 --> 01:00:13,354
I wonder how Sybil's feeling.

971
01:00:13,434 --> 01:00:15,953
The war's reaching its long fingers
into Downton

972
01:00:15,954 --> 01:00:17,793
and scattering our chicks.

973
01:00:17,794 --> 01:00:19,793
But I'm glad we made peace
with Matthew.

974
01:00:19,794 --> 01:00:22,713
I agree.
Let us thank Sir Richard Carlisle

975
01:00:22,714 --> 01:00:25,434
for distracting Mary
at just the right moment.

976
01:00:26,834 --> 01:00:30,073
By the way, she wants him to come
and stay. So we can all meet him.

977
01:00:30,074 --> 01:00:34,153
She wants us to invite a hawker of
newspaper scandal

978
01:00:34,154 --> 01:00:36,193
to stay as a guest in this house?

979
01:00:36,194 --> 01:00:38,194
It's lucky I have a sense of irony.

980
01:00:42,634 --> 01:00:44,634
(SNIFFLING)

981
01:00:48,394 --> 01:00:50,394
Not you, too.

982
01:01:03,234 --> 01:01:05,273
What's the matter?

983
01:01:05,274 --> 01:01:07,034
Why ask? You don't care.

984
01:01:07,954 --> 01:01:09,993
Ethel...

985
01:01:09,994 --> 01:01:13,233
Perhaps if you stopped going on
about all the marvellous things

986
01:01:13,234 --> 01:01:15,354
you're going to do when you leave
service.

987
01:01:15,954 --> 01:01:17,954
But you've got to have dreams.

988
01:01:18,834 --> 01:01:20,873
Don't you have any dreams?

989
01:01:20,874 --> 01:01:22,913
Of course I do.

990
01:01:22,914 --> 01:01:24,914
Big dreams.

991
01:01:26,594 --> 01:01:29,314
It's just that I know now
they won't be coming true.

992
01:01:41,954 --> 01:01:44,674
What do you want?
I think I left my book in here.

993
01:01:51,554 --> 01:01:54,153
Is that all?
You were praying.

994
01:01:54,154 --> 01:01:56,193
Don't be ridiculous.

995
01:01:56,194 --> 01:01:58,233
You were praying.

996
01:01:58,234 --> 01:02:00,994
What were you praying for?
Please go. I'm tired.

997
01:02:22,634 --> 01:02:24,673
Dear Lord,

998
01:02:24,674 --> 01:02:27,554
I don't pretend to have much credit
with you.

999
01:02:28,874 --> 01:02:30,874
I'm not even sure that you're there.

1000
01:02:32,634 --> 01:02:34,673
But if you are,

1001
01:02:34,674 --> 01:02:38,113
and if I've ever done anything good,

1002
01:02:38,114 --> 01:02:40,674
I beg you to keep him safe.

1003
01:03:06,674 --> 01:03:09,114
You look very comfortable there,
Corporal.

1004
01:03:12,474 --> 01:03:14,513
Would you like some, sir?

1005
01:03:14,514 --> 01:03:16,514
We've got condensed milk and sugar.

1006
01:03:17,314 --> 01:03:19,314
I won't ask how you managed that.

1007
01:03:23,114 --> 01:03:25,114
Go on, sir.

1008
01:03:28,514 --> 01:03:30,553
Oh, that's nectar.

1009
01:03:30,554 --> 01:03:32,593
Are you sure you can spare it?

1010
01:03:32,594 --> 01:03:35,233
Gladly, if we can talk about
the old days

1011
01:03:35,234 --> 01:03:37,834
and forget about all of this
for a minute or two.

1012
01:03:40,674 --> 01:03:42,594
Do you ever hear from anyone?
Oh, yes.

1013
01:03:42,595 --> 01:03:44,633
Miss O'Brien keeps me informed.

1014
01:03:44,634 --> 01:03:46,673
Lady Edith's driving.

1015
01:03:46,674 --> 01:03:48,914
Lady Sybil's training as a nurse.

1016
01:03:51,874 --> 01:03:54,793
Miss O'Brien tells me the hospital's
busier than ever,

1017
01:03:54,794 --> 01:03:56,833
with the wounded coming in.

1018
01:03:56,834 --> 01:03:58,873
Is that true?
Certainly is.

1019
01:03:58,874 --> 01:04:01,994
They had a concert when I was there
to raise extra funds.

1020
01:04:05,034 --> 01:04:07,073
I'm curious, sir.

1021
01:04:07,074 --> 01:04:10,633
Do you think I could ever get a
transfer back to the hospital?

1022
01:04:10,634 --> 01:04:12,634
Seeing as it's war work.

1023
01:04:13,434 --> 01:04:16,074
Well, you'd have to be sent home
from the front, first.

1024
01:04:17,154 --> 01:04:19,554
And then you might have to
pull a few strings.

1025
01:04:23,874 --> 01:04:25,913
Thank you for that.

1026
01:04:25,914 --> 01:04:27,914
Thank you very much.

1027
01:04:28,354 --> 01:04:30,393
What would my mother say?

1028
01:04:30,394 --> 01:04:33,594
Me entertaining the future
Earl of Grantham to tea.

1029
01:04:35,514 --> 01:04:38,953
War has a way of distinguishing
between the things that matter

1030
01:04:38,954 --> 01:04:40,954
and the things that don't.

1031
01:05:44,994 --> 01:05:46,994
(GUNSHOT)

1032
01:05:56,274 --> 01:05:58,313
Thank you.

1033
01:05:58,314 --> 01:06:00,314
Thank you for my deliverance.

1034
01:06:06,034 --> 01:06:07,713
Do you know Sir Richard Carlisle?

1035
01:06:07,714 --> 01:06:10,793
Her uncle and I are old friends.
Well, old acquaintances, anyway.

1036
01:06:10,794 --> 01:06:14,353
How dare you threaten me. Oh, I assure
you, I dare a great deal more than that!

1037
01:06:14,354 --> 01:06:16,234
If you still love him, let him
know.

1038
01:06:16,235 --> 01:06:19,393
If you don't tell him, you could
regret it all your life long.

1039
01:06:19,394 --> 01:06:21,633
You're like a real soldier!
I am a real soldier.

1040
01:06:21,634 --> 01:06:23,794
Thank you very much.
Now come and give me a kiss.

1041
01:06:25,874 --> 01:06:27,874
You see, I want you to marry me.

1042
01:06:28,274 --> 01:06:30,433
(GROANS)
Carson!

1043
01:06:30,434 --> 01:06:33,114
You'll find there's never a dull
moment in this house.

1044
01:06:33,139 --> 01:06:38,439
