3
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,800
Letter for you, William.

4
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,405
Why on earth are you doing that?

5
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:57,180
Well, someone's got to. Yes, indeed
they do.

6
00:00:57,215 --> 00:00:59,920
And that someone is William or one
of the maids.

7
00:00:59,955 --> 00:01:02,405
You're making work for yourself,
Mr Carson,

8
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,680
and I've no sympathy with that.
I'm not asking for sympathy.

9
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,285
I don't think you should be... What?

10
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,200
For heaven's sake. If something's
wrong put it right.

11
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,560
I'm sorry, Lang. I don't mean to
snap.

12
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:22,000
Not to worry, my lord. You've been
in the trenches I have not.

13
00:01:22,035 --> 00:01:24,040
I have no right to criticise.

14
00:01:24,075 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not a soldier now.

15
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,880
You've been invalided out. That is
perfectly honourable.

16
00:01:30,915 --> 00:01:32,840
Is it?

17
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:36,040
People look at me and wonder why I'm
not in uniform.

18
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,440
Then you refer them to me and I'll
give them a piece of my mind.

19
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,760
Hm?

20
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,440
Penny for your thoughts. They're
worth a great deal more than that.

21
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,920
What is it? My papers. They've come.
I've been called up.

22
00:01:56,955 --> 00:01:59,405
Oh, you never have. What does it
mean?

23
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,940
I report for my medical
on Wednesday and once

24
00:02:01,941 --> 00:02:04,440
I'm through that I go
to Richmond for training.

25
00:02:04,475 --> 00:02:08,440
Then you go to war? With any luck. I'll be
beggared if it's over before I get there.

26
00:02:08,475 --> 00:02:10,880
If they'd listen to me it'd be over
by tea time.

27
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,320
Daisy, I wonder... would you give me
a picture to take with me?

28
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:20,000
I haven't got one. Then have one
taken, on your afternoon off, please.

29
00:02:20,035 --> 00:02:22,240
That's enough. Let her get on with
her work.

30
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,685
How's Thomas coming along?

31
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,360
I wish he could be treated at our
hospital here.

32
00:02:28,395 --> 00:02:30,960
Well, it's only for officers. Of
course.

33
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,085
Although, ideally he'd love to be
transferred there to work.

34
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,560
He won't be sent back to the front?
Not with his hand the way it is.

35
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,240
It's such a pity he isn't under Dr
Clarkson.

36
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:46,485
We might have been able to influence
him a bit. I should hope so.

37
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:49,060
Without this family
and all the money you've

38
00:02:49,061 --> 00:02:51,600
spent his precious hospital
wouldn't exist at all.

39
00:02:51,635 --> 00:02:53,920
Perhaps I'll ask his advice. You
never know.

40
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,760
I was sure you'd have a good idea of
what to do for the best.

41
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,780
Fancy a tour in England, Davis?

42
00:03:06,815 --> 00:03:08,805
I assume you're having me on, sir.

43
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,080
Not at all. General Sir Herbert
Strutt

44
00:03:11,115 --> 00:03:13,320
has asked for my transfer to be his
ADC.

45
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,120
He's touring England to boost recruitment.
I know Manchester and Yorkshire well.

46
00:03:18,155 --> 00:03:21,200
It would mean a few months at home
and a promotion to captain.

47
00:03:21,235 --> 00:03:23,160
I can't object to that.

48
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,080
I've only got a few days before the
medical, my lady.

49
00:03:27,115 --> 00:03:29,165
Then go and tell your father.

50
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,560
You don't mind, do you,
Carson? We must manage

51
00:03:31,561 --> 00:03:33,920
with no footman at all
from next Wednesday.

52
00:03:33,955 --> 00:03:37,240
It'll be no different if we start
now. And you've always got Lang.

53
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,760
We wish you every good fortune.
Don't we, darling?

54
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,645
We certainly do.

55
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,000
Good luck, William. Thank you, my
lord.

56
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,740
So, both my footmen have gone to the
war

57
00:03:54,775 --> 00:03:56,960
while I cut ribbons and make
speeches.

58
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,320
And keep people's spirits up...

59
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,840
which is very important.

60
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,440
By God, I envy them though.

61
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:09,360
I envy their self respect and I envy
their ability to sleep at night.

62
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,100
Mr Carson doesn't like
the smell of cleaning

63
00:04:19,101 --> 00:04:21,400
materials in here, not
just before luncheon.

64
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,440
Come on, Mrs O'Brien. We don't want
to be unfriendly, do we?

65
00:04:25,475 --> 00:04:27,320
You obviously don't.

66
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,240
Finish it now but don't blame me if
Mr Carson takes a bit out of you.

67
00:04:34,275 --> 00:04:36,200
(CLEARS THROAT)

68
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,680
Hello, Mr Lang. Everything all
right?

69
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,325
Why do you say that?

70
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,480
No reason. I only meant I hope
you're enjoying yourself.

71
00:04:46,515 --> 00:04:48,525
I know I would be in your shoes.

72
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,680
You never tried for the job, did
you? I never got the chance.

73
00:04:51,715 --> 00:04:54,800
I'd no sooner heard that Mr Bates
was gone than he arrived.

74
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,440
What brings you here, Mr Molesley?

75
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,480
I was wondering if Anna was anywhere
around.

76
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,720
I could find her if you like. Oh,
no, no, no.

77
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,920
Just give her this. We were talking
about it the other day

78
00:05:09,955 --> 00:05:13,040
and I came across a copy in...Ripon.

79
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,520
Elizabeth And Her German Garden?

80
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,445
Whatever's that about?

81
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:26,480
It's about an invitation to talk
some more, that's what.

82
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,520
Goodbye, Dr Clarkson.

83
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,040
Lady Grantham.

84
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:39,160
I'd love to help but it's not within
my power

85
00:05:39,195 --> 00:05:42,400
to hook men from hither and thither
as I please.

86
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,720
That's not at all what I was asking.

87
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,480
I thought you were saying you wanted
Corporal Barrow

88
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:51,205
to come and work here when he's fully
recovered.

89
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,920
I think it a credit to him that he
wants to continue to serve in this way...

90
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,660
after he's been wounded. Well,
that's as maybe

91
00:05:58,695 --> 00:06:01,480
but it's not for me to decide what
happens next.

92
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,445
Mr Carson, are you quite well?

93
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,720
Oh, leave me alone.
(GRUNTS WITH EFFORT)

94
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:25,720
After 24 hours it disappeared. Are
you all right, Carson? Of course.

95
00:06:25,755 --> 00:06:28,760
That is, perfectly all right, Your
Ladyship, thank you.

96
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,485
Er, no.

97
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,680
Cousin Isobel says Matthew's coming
home in a fortnight.

98
00:06:34,715 --> 00:06:36,960
He's touring England with some
general.

99
00:06:36,995 --> 00:06:38,920
We'll have a dinner when he's here.

100
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:43,920
I was going to ask Richard Carlisle
about then for Saturday to Monday.

101
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:48,260
Be careful, Mary. Sir Richard
mustn't think you're after him.

102
00:06:48,295 --> 00:06:51,487
Isn't that the truth? The truth is
neither here nor there.

103
00:06:51,522 --> 00:06:54,680
It's the look of the thing that
matters. Ask Rosamund.

104
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,480
It'll take the edge off it. That'll
be nice.

105
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,045
Like before the war.

106
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,600
How can we manage a pre-war house
party without a single footman?

107
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,400
My dear, Rosamund is not a house
party.

108
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,080
She's blood.

109
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,780
I saw Mrs Drake when I went into the
village.

110
00:07:12,815 --> 00:07:15,560
The wife of John Drake who has
Longfield Farm.

111
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,125
Oh. What did she have to say?

112
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,760
Apparently their final able-bodied
farmhand has been called up.

113
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,285
They need a man to drive the
tractor.

114
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:28,680
Hasn't Drake recovered from his illness?
I thought he was better. He's much better.

115
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,200
But he doesn't drive.

116
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,005
So I told her I could do it.

117
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,400
What? I said I could drive the
tractor.

118
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,520
Edith! You are a lady not Toad of
Toad Hall.

119
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,960
Well, I'm doing it.

120
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,320
Don't look so bewildered. It's
simple.

121
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,725
I will drive the tractor.

122
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,565
Well, can you do that? Absolutely.

123
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,720
Can you hitch up the plough or
whatever it is I'm dragging?

124
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,200
Of course. When would you like me to
start?

125
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,760
I'd better get you something to
wear.

126
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,440
Oh, I like a bit of life
in a house but I just

127
00:08:19,441 --> 00:08:21,840
hope Mr Carson doesn't
spontaneously combust.

128
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,560
I had a letter yesterday.

129
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,205
Yes? It's my sister's boy.

130
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,480
He's with the Lancashire Fusiliers.

131
00:08:29,515 --> 00:08:31,485
Only he's gone missing.

132
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,280
Missing presumed dead they call it.

133
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,720
Oh, no.

134
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:41,680
How did it happen? They can't find out
- how it happened, why it happened,

135
00:08:41,715 --> 00:08:45,560
whether we can be sure it did happen
or he isn't lying prisoner somewhere.

136
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:51,320
Ask his lordship. He'll have friends in
the War Office. They can dig something up.

137
00:08:51,355 --> 00:08:53,680
Oh, I don't like to bother him.

138
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,840
Why not? He's got broad shoulders.

139
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,160
That's ever so fine, Mr Lang.

140
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,760
How can you make those big hands do
such delicate work?

141
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,800
I expect there's no end to the
things they could manage.

142
00:09:09,835 --> 00:09:11,760
Giving you a slap for a start.

143
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,840
That is good. Very good.

144
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,760
I like to see a proper skill.

145
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,200
Blokes think they can be a valet if
they can smile and tie a shoelace

146
00:09:26,235 --> 00:09:28,800
but there's an art to it and I can
tell you've got it.

147
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,320
My mother taught me.

148
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,080
She was a lady's maid, like you.

149
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,205
Well, she knew what she was about.

150
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,880
Oh, Mr Lang. As you know, Sir
Richard Carlisle arrives later

151
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:44,405
and the Crawleys are coming for
dinner tonight.

152
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:47,640
I really can't have maids in the
dining room for such a party

153
00:09:47,675 --> 00:09:50,840
so I'd be grateful if you'd help me
and play the footman.

154
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,325
Me? Wait at table?

155
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,205
Well, it's not ideal but I'm afraid
I've no choice.

156
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,120
The footman's liveries are in a
cupboard past Mrs Hughes' sitting room.

157
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,240
You should find one to fit you.

158
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,960
I'm not sure what I can do but I'm
happy to try.

159
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,360
What's his name? Archie.

160
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,680
That is Archibald Philpotts.

161
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,980
He was in the Lancashire Fusiliers.

162
00:10:17,015 --> 00:10:19,080
They think he was in northern
France.

163
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:23,360
You realise the most likely outcome
is that he has indeed been killed.

164
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:28,000
I understand, my lord. But we'd
rather know the worst than wonder.

165
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,200
Hm.

166
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:35,165
Ah. Oh, hello, Mr Molesley.

167
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,400
What are you doing here? I asked inside
and they said you were at the laundry.

168
00:10:39,435 --> 00:10:42,520
Lady Mary is wearing this tonight. I
wasn't sure it was done.

169
00:10:42,555 --> 00:10:45,377
I wondered if you'd had a chance to
read that book.

170
00:10:45,412 --> 00:10:48,200
You only gave it to me yesterday. Of
course, of course.

171
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:53,040
But when you have read it I hope we
can exchange our views.

172
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,400
That'd be nice. Perhaps we might
bring some of the others in.

173
00:10:57,435 --> 00:10:59,680
We could have a sort of reading
club.

174
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,805
We could do that.
(DISTANT BELL RINGS)

175
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:08,040
Or we could talk about it together
just we two. (FOOTSTEPS)

176
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,800
Heavens. It's later than I thought.
I must get on.

177
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,080
(DOOR OPENS)

178
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:26,320
I'm off to change but I wanted you to
know I sent a note to Clarkson

179
00:11:26,355 --> 00:11:28,805
which should do the trick. What did
you say?

180
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:32,960
That you'd asked a favour and, given that
the estate shoulders the hospital costs,

181
00:11:32,995 --> 00:11:35,800
it did seem unfair if we weren't
allowed a few perks.

182
00:11:35,835 --> 00:11:38,240
Quite right. Thank you, darling.

183
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,880
Well done, my lady.

184
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,200
(ENGINE RUMBLES)

185
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,040
Ready?

186
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,240
Ready!
(HEAVY CLUNKING)

187
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,800
Come on, damn you.

188
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,880
(GRINDING)

189
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,400
Whoa-ho-ho! Yes!

190
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,400
To the victor...the spoils.

191
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,565
Did you plant that tree?

192
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,560
Steady on. It must be 40 years old.

193
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,480
It's not a flattering light.

194
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,920
My father planted it. But you have
to be tough with fruit trees,

195
00:12:33,955 --> 00:12:35,880
not let them outstay their welcome.

196
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,040
Farming needs a kind of toughness,
doesn't it?

197
00:12:39,075 --> 00:12:41,840
There's room for sentiment but not
sentimentality.

198
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:44,080
Beautifully put, if I may say so, my
lady.

199
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,040
You should be a writer. Thank you.

200
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,720
How are you getting on? Very well, I
think.

201
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:53,920
It's not too hard for you? Not at
all. She's stronger than she looks.

202
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,600
I've brought you something to eat,
my lady.

203
00:12:57,635 --> 00:12:59,920
I'm afraid it's not what you're used
to.

204
00:12:59,955 --> 00:13:01,880
Hey, it's not for you.

205
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,880
So it is you.

206
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,360
Ethel thought I must have a soldier
fancy man.

207
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,960
Is she the new maid? Yes.

208
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,760
She's a soppy sort.

209
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:27,800
So, tell me, was Dr Clarkson
thrilled to have your services?

210
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,160
It's Major Clarkson now but yes.

211
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,360
I don't know how you did it.

212
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,720
What about your blighty?

213
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,880
My God. It's not so bad.

214
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,080
And it lived up to its name and got
me home.

215
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,925
You'd better come inside.

216
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,245
Where's William? Training for the
army.

217
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,520
I thought he might have died for
love of you.

218
00:14:00,555 --> 00:14:02,605
Don't be nasty as soon as you're
back.

219
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:06,480
Imagine Carson without a footman.
Like a ringmaster without a pony.

220
00:14:06,515 --> 00:14:09,005
We'll have none of your cheek, thank
you, Thomas.

221
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,200
I'm very sorry, Mrs Hughes, but I'm
not servant any more.

222
00:14:12,235 --> 00:14:14,200
I take my orders from Major
Clarkson.

223
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,240
Who's this? Ethel, the new maid. I
told you.

224
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,200
I didn't realise I was dealing with
an ex-footman.

225
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,920
I'm the one that got away.

226
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,525
Gives hope to us all.

227
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,280
Ethel, help with the luggage.
They're nearly back with Sir Richard.

228
00:14:32,315 --> 00:14:35,080
We've got a visitor, Mr Carson.
I've seen him.

229
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:43,400
Where's Mr Bates? Gone. Replaced by
Mr Lang.

230
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,480
So not all the changes were bad.

231
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:10,080
Oh. We're so pleased to have you
here, Sir Richard.

232
00:15:10,115 --> 00:15:12,005
Lady Grantham. Welcome. Thank you.

233
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,725
I hope the train wasn't too tiring.
Hello, Mary.

234
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,520
Not a bit, no. I got a lot done.
Hello, Aunt Rosamund.

235
00:15:17,555 --> 00:15:19,480
Brother, dear. How are you?

236
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,680
Lovely to see you, Rosamund.

237
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:31,760
He's nice, isn't he? He spent the
entire journey reading his own papers.

238
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:36,040
But I'm sure I'll love him dearly if
he'll ever look up from the page.

239
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,725
Branson, when you've finished
unloading

240
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:47,360
go to the hospital and remind Lady
Sybil that we expect her for dinner.

241
00:15:47,395 --> 00:15:49,405
And tell her I mean it.

242
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,440
Really. They're working her like a
packhorse in a mine.

243
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,080
I think she enjoys it though.

244
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,840
Please tell her to come home in time
to change.

245
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:06,120
I can't possibly come. Really, Mama
is incorrigible.

246
00:16:06,155 --> 00:16:08,360
It's not poor Branson's fault.

247
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:11,720
What is the point of Mama's soirees?
What are they for?

248
00:16:11,755 --> 00:16:14,760
Well, I'm going up for dinner and
I'm glad. Is that wrong?

249
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,405
Thomas.

250
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,800
You can cover for Nurse Crawley,
can't you?

251
00:16:20,835 --> 00:16:22,400
I can.

252
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,840
So you're back then, safe and sound.

253
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,885
That's not how I'd put it with my
hand the way it is

254
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:36,680
but, yes, Major Clarkson's found me
a place and I'm grateful.

255
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,680
Can you give Lieutenant Courtenay
his pills?

256
00:16:39,715 --> 00:16:41,640
Of course I can. Be glad to.

257
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,005
(DOOR OPENS)

258
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,040
Is everything under control?

259
00:16:51,075 --> 00:16:53,040
Mr Lang seems a bit nervous.

260
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,800
Stage fright. But what about you?

261
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,560
Oh... I'm a trouper.

262
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:05,200
And we can't complain, can we? Not when
you think what's going on in France.

263
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:10,080
Still...a broken heart can be as
painful as a broken limb.

264
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,440
Don't feel sorry for me, Mrs Hughes.
I'm not.

265
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:19,120
I know what real love is and there
aren't many who can say that.

266
00:17:19,155 --> 00:17:21,120
I'm one of the lucky ones.

267
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,120
If you say so.

268
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,840
So the fashion for cocktails before
dinner hasn't reached Yorkshire?

269
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:36,520
I could get Carson to make you one
but I won't guarantee the result.

270
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,320
Mrs Crawley, Captain Crawley and
Miss Swire.

271
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,880
Ah. Isobel.

272
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,885
Well now, still in one piece.

273
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:48,605
Thank God. Touch wood. I never
stopped touching it.

274
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,160
Do you know Sir Richard Carlisle? My
cousin, Captain Crawley.

275
00:17:52,195 --> 00:17:55,085
How do you do? And his fiancee Miss
Swire.

276
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,120
I know Miss Swire. Her uncle and I
are old friends.

277
00:17:58,155 --> 00:18:00,120
Well, old acquaintances anyway.

278
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,920
What do you think Mary sees in him?
Besides the money, you mean?

279
00:18:06,955 --> 00:18:10,840
It must be more than that. For
you...not necessarily for her.

280
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:16,240
What's General Strutt like? Well,
you know. Rather important.

281
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,840
And brave. He got the DSO in South
Africa.

282
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,360
Is there any chance it might be permanent
that we can count you out of danger?

283
00:18:23,395 --> 00:18:26,560
It would be such a relief. I wouldn't
want that, I'm afraid.

284
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,725
He's promised to get me back to
France.

285
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,960
How's your appointment with the
North Ridings working out?

286
00:18:32,995 --> 00:18:34,920
Oh, that. W...

287
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:38,040
It seems I won't be going to the
front after all.

288
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,965
I made a mistake.

289
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,960
They only wanted a mascot.

290
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,560
Mary tells me you're in newspapers.

291
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,725
Well, I own a few. Oh.

292
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,325
That must be quite a responsibility

293
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,560
at a time like this, you know, in a
war.

294
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:59,120
When it's so important to keep
people's spirits up.

295
00:18:59,155 --> 00:19:02,005
Lady Grantham, my responsibility is
to my investors.

296
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:06,480
I need to keep my readership up. I leave
public spirits to government propaganda.

297
00:19:06,515 --> 00:19:08,525
So now you've met Granny.

298
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,765
I warn you she has very strong
opinions.

299
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:14,880
Oh, you need have no fear where
that's concerned, my dear.

300
00:19:14,915 --> 00:19:16,880
We're more than evenly matched.

301
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,300
Where are the spoons for this? Just
here.

302
00:19:21,335 --> 00:19:23,485
Oh, my God. I've forgotten the
sauce.

303
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,080
Mr Lang's bringing the sauce and the
Melba toast. Right, good.

304
00:19:27,115 --> 00:19:29,357
Now, Mr Lang, are you ready? I think
so.

305
00:19:29,392 --> 00:19:31,600
It's always the left and not ladies
first.

306
00:19:31,635 --> 00:19:33,605
No, just follow Mr Carson.

307
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:37,520
Start with old Lady Grantham, then
his lordship, then just go on round.

308
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,160
You must have done this before. Not
since the war started.

309
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:44,805
I don't think I even knew that. Why
in't it just ladies first?

310
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:47,500
Wouldn't it be more
polite? That's how it's done

311
00:19:47,501 --> 00:19:50,160
on the continent. We don't
like foreign ways here.

312
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,160
I gather your footman, Thomas, has
returned to the village. No.

313
00:19:57,195 --> 00:19:59,245
Crikey. Where did you see him?

314
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,080
At the hospital. Seems he's working
there.

315
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:06,040
I wonder how he wangled that.
(No, no, get back behind me.)

316
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,045
What do you make of our plutocrat?

317
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,605
He's an opportunity. Mary's needs a
position

318
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,680
and, preferably a powerful one. He
can provide it.

319
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:24,160
You don't think she'd be happier
with a more traditional set-up?

320
00:20:24,195 --> 00:20:26,160
Will she have the option?

321
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:30,240
Thank you but I already have some.
No, no. Give that to me.

322
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,240
Oh! I do apologise, my lady.

323
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,680
Mr Lang, get a cl...
(GROANS IN PAIN)

324
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,960
(MOANS)
Carson. Carson, what's the matter?

325
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,920
Now, Carson, it's all right.
Everything will be fine.

326
00:20:45,955 --> 00:20:49,097
Edith, go with Branson and fetch
Major Clarkson.

327
00:20:49,132 --> 00:20:52,240
I'll telephone and explain. What
about my dress?

328
00:20:52,275 --> 00:20:54,605
Edith will get you a coat. Come.

329
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,320
Sybil will know what to do until the
doctor comes.

330
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,325
There's never a dull moment in this
house.

331
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:04,080
Lady Sybil and I will take him upstairs.
Mrs Hughes will show us the way.

332
00:21:04,115 --> 00:21:06,520
I can help. No, let me. I know what
I'm doing.

333
00:21:06,555 --> 00:21:08,885
I'm sure that's not necessary, my
lady.

334
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:12,240
It's not my lady now, Carson.
Mr Lang. It's Nurse Crawley.

335
00:21:12,275 --> 00:21:14,240
Mr Lang. Come on.

336
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,900
Anna and Ethel, I must trust the
dinner to you.

337
00:21:18,935 --> 00:21:21,800
I'd say the first course is a thing
of the past.

338
00:21:21,835 --> 00:21:24,005
Then clear and lay the hot plates.

339
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:27,960
Daisy, you fetch the beef and the
rest of it. Anna, you serve the wine.

340
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,805
Mr Lang, you can clear up the mess.

341
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:36,880
I'll do that. There's no need. I
don't mind. I thank you.

342
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,680
Mr Lang, you'd better go downstairs.

343
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,805
Well, Clarkson's seen him.

344
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:47,760
It's definitely not a heart attack
but he does need rest.

345
00:21:47,795 --> 00:21:49,760
He's working much too hard.

346
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,240
For a start he's just got to let the
maids serve in the dining room.

347
00:21:54,275 --> 00:21:56,240
Quite right. There is a war.

348
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,320
Even Carson has to make sacrifices.

349
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,880
Poor Lang. He looked like a rabbit
in front of a snake.

350
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,120
I don't understand it. He seemed so
solid when I met him,

351
00:22:08,155 --> 00:22:10,480
even taciturn, now he's a bundle of
nerves.

352
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,680
I heard what you said to Matthew
about the regiment.

353
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:18,000
Everyone else knows what a fool I
made of myself, why shouldn't he?

354
00:22:18,035 --> 00:22:20,600
I don't think you're a fool. Isn't
that enough?

355
00:22:20,635 --> 00:22:21,960
No.

356
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,600
Maybe it should be but it isn't.

357
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,120
(DISTANT EXPLOSIONS)

358
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,320
(DISTANT MACHINE-GUN FIRE)

359
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,680
Are you all right, Mr Lang?

360
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,960
You're not, are you?

361
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,760
I've seen shell shock before, you
know.

362
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,680
I had a brother with it.

363
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,320
My favourite brother, as it happens.

364
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,240
And I was his favourite too.

365
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,520
They sent him back and he's dead
now.

366
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,960
They won't send me back.

367
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,700
I'm a goner as far as they're
concerned.

368
00:23:14,735 --> 00:23:16,960
You shouldn't be working yet. I must
work.

369
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,320
I don't know what to do else.

370
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,040
I have to work.
(FOOTSTEPS)

371
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,285
Mr Lang. I thought you'd gone up.

372
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,960
He wanted to hang up the livery
before it got creased.

373
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,160
Well, we can discuss the dinner
another time.

374
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,680
I'll say good night. Good night, Mrs
Hughes. Good night.

375
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,325
May I come in?

376
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:03,640
That's very kind of you, my lady,
but do you think you should?

377
00:24:03,675 --> 00:24:05,880
Let's hope my reputation will
survive it.

378
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,400
And rest easy, please.

379
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:16,000
I gather it isn't too serious. Oh,
I've been very stupid, my lady.

380
00:24:16,035 --> 00:24:18,045
I let myself get flustered.

381
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,365
I regard that as highly
unprofessional.

382
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,400
It won't happen again. Don't be too
hard on yourself.

383
00:24:23,435 --> 00:24:26,400
I was particularly sorry to spoil
things for Sir Richard,

384
00:24:26,435 --> 00:24:28,600
knowing he was a guest of yours.
Don't be.

385
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,440
I think he found it all quite
exciting.

386
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,880
Will we be seeing a lot of him?

387
00:24:35,915 --> 00:24:38,760
I don't know. Maybe.

388
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,520
And Captain Crawley...

389
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:46,400
is he happy with the changes, so to
speak?

390
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:56,480
May I give you one piece of advice,
my lady?

391
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,760
Tell him what's in your heart.

392
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,240
If you still love him, let him know.

393
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,960
Then even if he's killed, and he may
be, you won't be sorry.

394
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:11,160
But if you don't tell him you could
regret it all your life long.

395
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,760
And what about Miss Swire?

396
00:25:14,795 --> 00:25:16,760
Well... Miss Swire.

397
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:20,880
As if any man in his right mind could
prefer Miss Swire to you.

398
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:29,320
Oh, I'm so sorry, my lady. I didn't
know you were in here.

399
00:25:29,355 --> 00:25:32,960
I was just going. Carson's been
boosting my confidence.

400
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:44,240
That's something I'd never have
thought she was short of.

401
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,560
What about you, sir?

402
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,200
What did you do before the war
started?

403
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,760
I was up at Oxford.

404
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,120
But I only ever planned to farm.

405
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,120
Farm and shoot.

406
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,960
And hunt and fish.

407
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,080
And everything I'll never do again.

408
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:13,360
You don't know that. We've had cases
of gas blindness wearing off.

409
00:26:13,395 --> 00:26:15,045
Rare cases.

410
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,125
And much sooner than this.

411
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,360
It doesn't help me to be lied to, you
know.

412
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,480
I'm finished.

413
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,400
And I'd rather face it than dodge it.

414
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,480
I'd better go.

415
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,720
Where's Rosamund? She's with your
mama.

416
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:38,080
Trying to talk her into the idea of
Sir Richard.

417
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,120
You don't sound very enthusiastic.

418
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,880
Are you?

419
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,565
Can we stop for a minute?

420
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,400
Don't tell me you're tired. I'm not
tired, I'm hot.

421
00:26:49,435 --> 00:26:51,445
This tweed is too thick.

422
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:54,120
It looks more suited to shooting
than walking.

423
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:58,160
I had it made for the weekend. I
didn't know there was a difference.

424
00:26:58,195 --> 00:27:01,720
It doesn't matter. That's like the
rich who say money doesn't matter.

425
00:27:01,755 --> 00:27:04,137
It matters enough when you haven't
got it.

426
00:27:04,172 --> 00:27:06,520
I know you don't care about our
silly rules.

427
00:27:06,555 --> 00:27:08,520
You're always very clear on that
score.

428
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,520
You make me sound rude and I hope
I'm not that.

429
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:16,800
I mean to learn how to do things
properly and you could help me a lot.

430
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:21,560
But I'm not ashamed of being what
they call a self-made man.

431
00:27:21,595 --> 00:27:23,320
I'm proud of it.

432
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,400
Is the point of all this to test me
in some way?

433
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,000
Maybe.

434
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,680
Are you shocked by my bold and
modern values?

435
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,600
Oh, Sir Richard, you flatter
yourself.

436
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,520
It takes a good deal more than that
to shock me.

437
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:53,400
But, Mama, who do you imagine is out
there with more to offer?

438
00:27:53,435 --> 00:27:55,720
I'm not a romantic. I should hope
not.

439
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,680
But even I will concede that the
heart does not exist

440
00:27:58,715 --> 00:28:00,977
solely for the purpose of pumping
blood.

441
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:03,240
That is charming, especially from
you.

442
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,920
But Mary seems to have...blotted her
copybook in some way.

443
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,720
So she needs a suitable marriage
that will mend her fences.

444
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,645
Well, how do we know Carlisle is
suitable?

445
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:22,365
Who is he? Who'd ever heard of him
before the war?

446
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:26,200
Sir Richard is powerful and rich and
well on the way to a peerage.

447
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:29,740
Of course, he may not be all that
one would wish

448
00:28:29,775 --> 00:28:32,467
but Mary can soon smooth off the
rough edges.

449
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:35,160
Well, you should know. What do you
mean by that?

450
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,725
Marmaduke was a gentleman.

451
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,045
Marmaduke was the grandson of a
manufacturer.

452
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,800
His mother was the daughter of a
baronet. Maybe...

453
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:47,080
but they were no great threat to the
Plantagenets.

454
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:52,320
The point is I made up for any
social deficiencies.

455
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:54,365
And he provided me with a position.

456
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,685
It was a good exchange and it worked
well.

457
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,720
How can Matthew have chosen that
little blonde piece?

458
00:28:59,755 --> 00:29:02,720
You speak so eloquently of the human
heart, Mama.

459
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,440
You must be aware of its...vagaries.

460
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:11,840
'Things cannot be as they were and
Jack has your best interests at heart.'

461
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:13,200
Stop.

462
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,320
Who's Jack?

463
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,840
My younger brother.

464
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,400
He means to replace me.

465
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,520
It's what he's always wanted.

466
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,600
Yeah... well...

467
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,040
I'm sorry.

468
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,840
I mustn't bore you.

469
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,480
Don't let them walk all over you.

470
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,640
You've got to fight your corner.

471
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,560
What with? Your brain.

472
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,600
You're not a victim. Don't let them
make you into one.

473
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,000
You know, when you talk like that...

474
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,360
I almost believe you.

475
00:29:59,395 --> 00:30:01,280
You should believe me.

476
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,920
All my life they've...

477
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,600
pushed me around just cos I'm
different.

478
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,280
How? Why are you different?

479
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,520
Never mind.

480
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,725
Look...

481
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,880
Look, I... I don't know if you're
going to see again or not.

482
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,960
But I do know you have to fight
back.

483
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,160
How dare you threaten me? How dare
I?

484
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,965
I assure I dare a great deal more
than that.

485
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,580
But you can't, you wouldn't. I
didn't say I would.

486
00:30:50,615 --> 00:30:53,160
I was merely reminding you it was in
my power.

487
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,960
Lady Painswick. Lady Rosamund.

488
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:03,160
I'm sorry. I'll get these things
sorted out before long.

489
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:05,200
It's not important.

490
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,880
Miss Swire and I were just talking
about old times.

491
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,240
Happy old times, I hope.

492
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,440
Will you forgive me? I want to write
some letters before dinner.

493
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,920
Let's have a rest. We've earned it.

494
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,640
I should have got a glass. You can't
drink out of a bottle, my lady.

495
00:31:32,675 --> 00:31:34,685
I wish you'd call me Edith.

496
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,920
And of course I can drink from the
bottle.

497
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,920
Would you like me to teach you to
drive?

498
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:49,600
Not much...cos then you wouldn't
come here no more.

499
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,840
Although that wouldn't matter to you.

500
00:31:52,875 --> 00:31:54,800
Why do you say that?

501
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,920
You're pretty and clever and fine.

502
00:31:58,955 --> 00:32:01,720
You're from a different world.

503
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,200
Is something wrong? No, just having
a break.

504
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,500
Because you want to get into town to
fetch the bone meal.

505
00:32:09,535 --> 00:32:12,520
And be back in time to feed the cows
before it's dark.

506
00:32:12,555 --> 00:32:14,720
They could always have a midnight
feast.

507
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:24,840
That's it, sir. If you move the stick fast
enough you don't have to slacken your pace.

508
00:32:24,875 --> 00:32:27,840
Check the width of the space as well
as any obstruction.

509
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:31,120
Lieutenant Courtenay, well done.

510
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,960
You're making good progress. Thanks
to my saviours, sir.

511
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:40,800
So you'll be pleased to hear that it's
time to continue your treatment elsewhere.

512
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,760
What? At Farley Hall.

513
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:48,280
You're not ill any more. All you need
is time to adjust to your condition.

514
00:32:48,315 --> 00:32:50,320
The staff at Farley can help with
that.

515
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:54,000
But, sir, these two are helping me
here.

516
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:59,000
Nurse Crawley and Corporal Barrow
are not trained in specialist care.

517
00:32:59,035 --> 00:33:01,280
Please. Don't send me away.

518
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,360
Not yet.

519
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,640
Sir, surely we...

520
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:14,600
Lieutenant...you must know that
every one of our beds is needed

521
00:33:14,635 --> 00:33:16,680
for the injured and dying from
Arras.

522
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,920
Hm?

523
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,600
Corporal, I'll see you in my office.

524
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:30,180
Sir, I only meant to say that
Lieutenant Courtenay is depressed.

525
00:33:30,215 --> 00:33:33,800
I will not leave wounded soldiers
freezing or sweating under canvas

526
00:33:33,835 --> 00:33:35,965
because a junior officer is
depressed!

527
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,480
(KNOCK AT DOOR)
Yes? I thought you may want to know what I think.

528
00:33:39,515 --> 00:33:41,565
Why should I?

529
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:46,080
Nurse Crawley, I may not be your
social superior in a Mayfair ballroom

530
00:33:46,115 --> 00:33:48,600
but in this hospital I have the
deciding voice.

531
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:55,160
Please help him prepare his
belongings. He leaves in the morning.

532
00:33:56,920 --> 00:34:01,140
Anna and Ethel will wait at the table.
I will supervise. What's wrong with that?

533
00:34:01,175 --> 00:34:05,360
Nothing. Except that it's how a chartered
accountant has his dinner served.

534
00:34:05,395 --> 00:34:08,637
I can think of worse insults. If you
say so.

535
00:34:08,672 --> 00:34:11,880
But I don't want Lang allowed
anywhere near it.

536
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:16,680
Oh, Mr Bates. Where are you when we
need you?

537
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,400
Can you bring me the wine ledgers and
I'll make a selection?

538
00:34:20,435 --> 00:34:24,240
His lordship's already done that.
Just try to rest.

539
00:34:24,275 --> 00:34:26,765
To rest or to feel redundant?

540
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:30,240
Both if it'll slow you down for a
minute and a half.

541
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:33,240
The world does not turn on the style
of a dinner.

542
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,560
My world does.

543
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,160
How does he know Miss Swire?

544
00:34:40,195 --> 00:34:42,205
What? Miss Swire.

545
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:45,120
They were in the garden when I came
back from Mama's.

546
00:34:45,155 --> 00:34:47,080
I suppose they met in London.

547
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:53,120
Would you like me to come back
later, my lady? No, come in.

548
00:34:53,155 --> 00:34:55,040
I was just leaving.

549
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,380
How's Carson getting on? Oh, much
better, my lady.

550
00:35:04,415 --> 00:35:07,000
Mrs Hughes is having a job keeping
him in bed.

551
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,840
He gave me some advice last night.

552
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,525
Oh, yes?

553
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,520
Was it good advice?

554
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,005
It was about honesty.

555
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,240
He thinks I should say what I really
feel.

556
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,520
Sounds a bit wild for Mr Carson.

557
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,640
Do you think he's right?

558
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,560
Well, they do say honesty is the
best policy.

559
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,085
And I think you regret being honest

560
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:38,320
less often than you regret telling
lies.

561
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:10,120
He must have smuggled a razor into
his bed.

562
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,760
There was nothing to be done.

563
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,120
It's because we ordered him to go.
We don't know that.

564
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,560
This is a tragedy, I don't deny it.

565
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,840
But I cannot see what other course
was open to me.

566
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,285
We have no room for men to
convalesce

567
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:28,000
and Farley is the nearest house I
can send them to.

568
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,640
There is a solution and it's staring
us in the face.

569
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:36,040
Downton Abbey. Would they ever allow
it?

570
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,840
Or even consider it? I think they
would.

571
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:46,120
After this I think they can be made
to.

Richard, please.

574
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,040
You see, I want you to marry me.

575
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,920
Why?

576
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:08,480
Because I think very highly of you.

577
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,040
Very highly...goodness.

578
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:14,640
I mean it. I think we'd do well
together.

579
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,540
We could be a good team.

580
00:37:17,575 --> 00:37:19,560
Now, that sounds better.

581
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,965
But I can't help thinking

582
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,000
that tradition demands a little
mention of love.

583
00:37:27,035 --> 00:37:30,360
Oh, I can talk about love and moon
and June

and all the rest of it if you wish.

And we can build something worth
having, you and I, if you'll let us.

and bounds.

I feel useful for the first time in

So you wouldn't go back...

608
00:39:13,675 --> 00:39:15,685
to your life before the war?

609
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,840
No. No, I could never go back to
that again.

What's the matter?

00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,920
Are you looking for Matthew?

I was...but it's not important.

Tell me what it is...please.

618
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,560
He has to go a day early. Tomorrow
morning, in fact.

619
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:00,960
Only to meet his general, surely.
Not back to France.

620
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,200
But he must go back one day.

621
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:08,040
I can't imagine what I'd do if
anything happened to him.

622
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,040
I know he'll be all right.

No, you don't. None of us do.

We say that sort of thing but we
don't know.

If he died I don't think I could go
on living.

What's doing?

She's awfully cut up that I have to
go early.

doesn't sound too dangerous.

I can't...but thank you.

00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:20,840
we hope you're still coming for
dinner tonight.

639
00:41:20,875 --> 00:41:22,760
Certainly we are. Why wouldn't we?

00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,840
Sure? It'll be your last evening.

641
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:31,200
Why? Don't you want me? Of course I
want you...very much.

642
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,920
I'm sorry you've had a wasted
journey. Not at all.

643
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,680
I needed an excuse for a walk.

644
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:41,320
I'll see you at eight.

645
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:54,280
Ethel said you wanted me. No, no, I
just need a word with you.

If it's about the book I'm afraid -
It's not about the book.

647
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:01,600
What is it then?

648
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:06,200
I understand that Mr Bates has
gone...for good.

649
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:09,480
Yes, I believe that's true.

650
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,280
So I was hoping...

651
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:17,040
we might be able to see a little
more of each other.

652

Mr Molesley...

653
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,840
I take this as a real
compliment...

654
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,560
But it's not going to happen.

655
00:42:28,595 --> 00:42:30,120
No.

656
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,760
You see...

657
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:38,920
if you had a child and that child
was taken from you,

658
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,200
if the child was sent to the moon,

659
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:46,200
there'd never be one day when they
were out of your thoughts,

660
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,640
no moment when you weren't praying
for their welfare,

661
00:42:49,675 --> 00:42:51,960
even if you knew you'd never see
them again.

662
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,560
That's you and Mr Bates.

663
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,960
That's me and Mr Bates.

664
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,240
But thank you.

665
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:19,080
I've kept you too long. You should
get back or they'll be looking for you.

666
00:43:19,115 --> 00:43:21,120
We've done a lot, haven't we? We
have.

667
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:25,720
I'll have to invent some tasks or they'll
be no need for you to come much more.

668
00:43:25,755 --> 00:43:27,680
Then start inventing, please.

669
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:30,160
I will.

670
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,040
Cos I'd hate it if you were to stay
away.

671
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:36,120
So would I.

672
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,560
I'd absolutely hate it.

673
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:54,320
I can't believe I've done that. I'm
awfully glad you did.

674
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,200
You'll have me thrown in the tower.

675
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:59,920
Only if they give me the key.

676
00:43:59,955 --> 00:44:02,245
Fold it in. Don't slap it.

677
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:04,640
You're making a cake not beating a
carpet.

678
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,920
Oh, sorry, Your Lordship, I didn't
see you there.

679
00:44:08,955 --> 00:44:10,965
It's quite all right, Mrs Patmore.

680
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,960
I wonder, is there somewhere we could
have a word? Er...

681
00:44:13,995 --> 00:44:16,400
Er... Why not go into my sitting
room?

682
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:22,640
Please sit.

683
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,525
I do have some news of your nephew.

684
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:31,840
I telephoned the War Office. They've just
come back to me but it's not good news.

685
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:34,285
I knew he was dead all along.

686
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:38,000
I said so to my sister. I said, 'Kate,
he's gone and you'll have to fa -

687
00:44:38,035 --> 00:44:39,960
Mrs Patmore, it's worse than that.

688
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,840
What can be worse than being dead?

689
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:49,200
Private Philpotts was shot for
cowardice on 17 February.

690

Oh, my God.

691
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:56,520
This explains why the regiment was
reluctant to supply information.

(SOBS)

693
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,520
Mrs Hughes, could you come in,
please?

694
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:17,920
Mrs Patmore has had some bad news.
Her nephew has been killed.

695
00:45:17,955 --> 00:45:20,480
Oh, he never has? And that's not
all.

696
00:45:20,515 --> 00:45:22,480
It is all, Mrs Patmore.

697
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:25,405
Let us make sure it is all.

698
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,760
Your sister needs to know no more
than this.

699
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:31,920
We cannot know the truth. We should
not judge.

700
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:39,445
I think it's a ridiculous idea.

701
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:42,725
Why? Because this is a house not a
hospital.

702
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:46,240
Granny, a convalescent home is where
people rest and recuperate.

703
00:45:46,275 --> 00:45:48,240
But if there are relapses, what
then?

704
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:52,280
Amputation in the dining room?
Resuscitation in the pantry?

705
00:45:52,315 --> 00:45:54,637
It would be the most tremendous
disturbance.

706
00:45:54,672 --> 00:45:56,960
If you knew how chaotic things are
as it is.

707
00:45:56,995 --> 00:45:58,960
But when so much good can be done.

708
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:02,640
I forbid it.

709
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,640
To have strange men prodding and
prying around the house.

710
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:09,960
To say nothing of pocketing the
spoons.

711
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,885
It's out of the question. I hesitate
to remind you

712
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:16,480
but this is my house, Robert's and
mine, and we will make the decision.

713
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:25,040
Oh, I see.

714
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:29,600
So now I'm an outsider...who need
not be consulted.

715
00:46:29,635 --> 00:46:31,560
Since you put it like that, yes.

716
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:36,640
What was it like at the hospital
today?

717
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,880
At the front...

718
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:45,040
the men pray to be spared, of
course.

719
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:50,160
But if that's not to be...

720
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:55,280
they pray for a bullet that kills
them cleanly.

721
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,240
For too many of them today that
prayer had not been answered.

722
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:09,325
We'll eat in about 20 minutes.

723
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:12,400
Good. And would you have any to
spare for a poor traveller?

724
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:17,920
William, I don't believe it. Pinch
me. I am your dream come true.

725
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:21,760
You're like a real soldier. I am a
real soldier, thank you very much.

726
00:47:21,795 --> 00:47:23,805
Now come and give me a kiss. Ooh.

727
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:27,380
We'll have none of that. Won't you
let a tommy kiss his sweetheart,

728
00:47:27,415 --> 00:47:30,807
when he's off to fight the Hun? Have
you finished your training?

729
00:47:30,842 --> 00:47:34,200
Not yet but it won't be long. On the
eve of departure we'll see

730
00:47:34,235 --> 00:47:36,120
but right now put her down.

731
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:39,845
I'll show you.

732
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:42,080
What do you think? There. Smart, in't
it?

733
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:50,520
William? What a treat to see you.

734
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:53,080
And how smart you look.

735
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:56,405
Welcome. Thanks. Supper won't be
long.

736
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:59,000
I'm just clearing the dining room.
Shall I help?

737
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,920
Course not. You're in the army now.

738
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:06,440
So, still full of the joys of war
then?

739
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,120
I'm not sorry to be part of it, Mr
Lang, and I can't pretend I am.

740
00:48:11,155 --> 00:48:13,165
Oh, yes, you're part of it.

741
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,120
Like a metal cog is part of a
factory.

742
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:17,680
Or a grain of sand is part of the
beach.

743
00:48:17,715 --> 00:48:19,760
It's all right, Mr Lang. I
understand.

744
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:23,000
And I'm not saying I'm important or
owt like that.

745
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,845
But I believe in this war.

746
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:29,600
I believe in what we're fighting for
and I want to do my bit.

747
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:34,000
Then God help you.

(LOW CONVERSATION)

749
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,960
Edith seems jolly tonight.

750
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:52,240
She's found her metier - farm
labouring.

751
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,245
Don't be so tough on her.

752
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:57,880
That's like asking the fox to spare
the chicken.

753
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:03,280
What about you? Last time you told
me good news was imminent.

754
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,120
Would you be happy if it were? Of
course.

755
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:11,120
I've found someone now and I want
you to do the same.

756
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,560
If you'd taken another minute to
make up your mind,

757
00:49:16,595 --> 00:49:18,600
we'd all have marched over the cliff.

758
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,320
I'll tell you something else as
well...

759
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:25,120
William's got more to say than a
parliamentary candidate.

760
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:28,600
What's the matter? I know it's my
fault...

761
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:33,200
but I wish I hadn't let him think
that we're like sweethearts.

762
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:36,080
Because we're not. Not by my
reckoning, anyway.

763
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:38,920
Too late for second thoughts now,
missy.

764
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:42,460
You don't have to marry him when it
comes to it

765
00:49:42,495 --> 00:49:45,120
but you can't let him go to war with
a broken heart

766
00:49:45,155 --> 00:49:46,960
or he won't come back.

767
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:52,160
What a time we've had.

768
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,200
Poor Sir Richard must have thought
he'd come to a madhouse.

769
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:59,120
I don't expect it'll put him off.

770
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,360
I'm going to accept him.

771
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:12,120
Do you think I should?

772
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:14,880
That's not for me to say.

773
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:22,240
If you love him more than anyone in
the world then of course you should.

774
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:25,680
It's not as simple as that. Oh?

775
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,525
It is for me.

776
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:31,520
But then I'm not your ladyship.

777
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:38,720
Did you love Bates more than anyone
else in the world?

778
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:41,820
I did.

779
00:50:41,855 --> 00:50:43,520
I do.

780
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:46,240
I'll never love again like I love
him.

781
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:48,240
Ever.

782
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:52,400
Well, there you are then.

783
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:57,040
One day you'll meet someone else and
you'll marry.

784
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:00,520
Perhaps it'll be second best but...

785
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:04,360
it doesn't mean you can't have a life.

786
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:09,320
I think it does... for me.

787
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:17,960
Are you sure you should be doing this?
We've managed well with Mrs Hughes.

788
00:51:17,995 --> 00:51:19,645
Quite sure, my lord.

789
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,920
And breakfast is not a taxing
assignment.

790
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:28,480
Edith, this is a message for you. Mrs Drake
writes that they've decided to hire a man

791
00:51:28,515 --> 00:51:30,480
so they won't be needing you any
more.

792
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:34,320
Is that all she says? Oh, well,
she's very grateful.

793
00:51:34,355 --> 00:51:37,520
Here. She says she and Drake send
their thanks to you

794
00:51:37,555 --> 00:51:39,840
for giving up so much of your
valuable time.

795
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:42,240
I expect it's rather a relief.

796
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:45,800
Oh, I wouldn't say that...

797
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:49,120
not entirely. Has Lady Sybil gone
already?

798
00:51:49,155 --> 00:51:51,565
She had a tray at half past six. She
would.

799
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:54,480
Carson, did you know we're to be
turned into a hospital?

800
00:51:54,515 --> 00:51:56,365
A convalescent home.

801
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:59,400
I'm afraid we've all bullied you
into the whole thing.

802
00:51:59,435 --> 00:52:01,845
I hope you're not dreading it too
much.

803
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:06,080
Not exactly but it's a brave new world
we're headed for, no doubt about that.

804
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:10,080
We just try to meet it with as much
grace as we can muster.

805
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:20,100
I thought I saw Mr Bates. Isn't he
in London?

806
00:52:20,135 --> 00:52:22,645
Thomas, the footman, managing
Downton Abbey?

807
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:25,400
Give orders for the beds, the nurses
and the patients

808
00:52:25,435 --> 00:52:27,320
to be packed up and shipped out at
once!

809
00:52:27,355 --> 00:52:29,285
Do you remember when Aunt Rosamund

810
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:31,645
found you and Richard Carlisle in
the garden?

811
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:34,640
I hope you didn't unearth anything
too fearful. Ask Mary.

812
00:52:34,675 --> 00:52:36,597
I'll get them one way or another.

813
00:52:36,632 --> 00:52:38,485
There's no need to be so rough.

814
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:40,720
There's every need... to stop a
murder.

815
00:52:40,755 --> 00:52:42,205
Are we engaged?

816
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:44,820
It's not against the law
to take a mistress. I know

817
00:52:44,821 --> 00:52:47,400
you and I love you. That is
not the right path for you.

818
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:57,480
