1
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,840
Hurry up, girls. Come on.

2
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,005
Come on, come on!
You should be done here!

3
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,560
They'll be back from the station
any second now!

4
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,580
I haven't had a chance to ask.
How was London?

5
00:00:58,615 --> 00:01:01,547
Oh, much as usual.
Dirty, noisy. Quite enjoyable.

6
00:01:01,582 --> 00:01:04,291
There was no need for you
to come back a day early.

7
00:01:04,326 --> 00:01:06,965
I'm perfectly capable of getting
the house ready.

8
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Of course you are. But I'd like to have the heavy
luggage back and unpacked before they get here.

9
00:01:11,035 --> 00:01:13,560
I suppose... Steady, William!

10
00:01:13,595 --> 00:01:15,560
This isn't a race.

11
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,405
Poor lad.
But he did see her?

12
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,200
I was worried when I took him to
King's Cross.

13
00:01:23,235 --> 00:01:25,200
Yes, he had time to say goodbye.

14
00:01:25,235 --> 00:01:27,605
How is he now?

15
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:31,120
Well, you've only got one mother,
haven't you?

16
00:01:31,155 --> 00:01:33,240
They're here, Mrs Hughes!

17
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,240
Hello, William.
It's good to have you back.

18
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,925
What a relief to be home.

19
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:53,000
Don't listen when His Lordship
pretends not to enjoy the season!

20
00:01:53,035 --> 00:01:56,365
When in Rome...
Will Lady Mary be back soon?

21
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,800
She's staying on with my sister
for a couple of weeks.

22
00:01:58,835 --> 00:02:00,805
So Grantham House is closed?

23
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,165
It will be by the end of this week.

24
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,320
Dear Mrs Hughes, I hope you've had
some time to yourself

25
00:02:06,355 --> 00:02:07,685
while we've been away.

26
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:11,320
I've tackled a few jobs that get
forgotten when the house is full.

27
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,045
Any local news? The main topic here

28
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,000
is the murder of the Austrian
Archduke.

29
00:02:17,035 --> 00:02:19,205
Here and everywhere else.

30
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,480
I'm afraid we haven't heard
the last of that.

31
00:02:21,515 --> 00:02:23,805
How's William?
Bearing up.

32
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,560
Poor chap. He has our sympathies.

33
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,800
I think I'll wash the train off
before dinner. Very good, my lord.

34
00:02:30,835 --> 00:02:33,365
I can unpack while you're bathing.
I'll see you up there.

35
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,640
Mrs Hughes, have you thought about
the garden party for the hospital?

36
00:02:36,675 --> 00:02:39,520
I've started on it, but there are
things we need to talk about.

37
00:02:39,555 --> 00:02:43,520
Oh, dear. That sounds like trouble.
I'll take my hat off.

38
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:49,920
Sybil? You were a great success
in London, darling. Well done.

39
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,525
You never say that to me.
Don't I?

40
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,920
You were very helpful, dear.
Thank you.

41
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,980
I hate to spoil
Her Ladyship's homecoming,

42
00:03:03,015 --> 00:03:05,760
but what are we going to do about
Mrs Patmore?

43
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,360
She's worse than when you left.
Much worse.

44
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,285
And I meant to ask,

45
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:16,760
is there a decision
about Mr Bates leaving?

46
00:03:16,795 --> 00:03:18,640
Not yet.
His Lordship wants the facts

47
00:03:18,675 --> 00:03:20,200
and Mr Bates won't give them.

48
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,720
So what are you going to say
to Her Ladyship about Mrs Patmore?

49
00:03:25,755 --> 00:03:28,125
Oh, I'm not sure.

50
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,880
I don't want the poor woman sacked,

51
00:03:30,915 --> 00:03:33,600
but...things cannot go on
as they are.

52
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,080
There's nothing like an English
summer, is there?

53
00:03:41,115 --> 00:03:44,045
Except an English winter.

54
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,645
I'm sorry you haven't received
more invitations.

55
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,320
But then, after four seasons, one
is less a debutante than a survivor.

56
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,120
My dear, is there anything
you're not telling me?

57
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,780
No.
Only, one hears stories.

58
00:03:58,815 --> 00:04:01,200
There's nothing, Aunt Rosamund.

59
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:06,125
So, have you decided...

60
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:09,205
whether or not to marry
Cousin Matthew?

61
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,640
Oh, there's no secret Cora can keep
for more than a month.

62
00:04:12,675 --> 00:04:15,445
You'd be surprised.

63
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:19,100
I've told him I'll give him
my answer the day I get back.

64
00:04:19,135 --> 00:04:22,720
Well, it would be very tidy.
At least we can say that.

65
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,760
Fancy a smoke?
Don't mind if I do.

66
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,160
There they go -
Guy Fawkes and his assistant.

67
00:04:40,195 --> 00:04:42,000
Which is which?
Here you are.

68
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,760
Surely, if His Lordship hasn't done
anything until now,

69
00:04:49,795 --> 00:04:52,520
it means he doesn't want to take it
any further.

70
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,400
Anna's made me an armband,
Mr Carson.

71
00:04:55,435 --> 00:04:58,725
For my mother. Can I wear it?

72
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,440
I daresay.
Not when we're entertaining,

73
00:05:01,475 --> 00:05:03,320
but otherwise...

74
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,640
Hello, Doctor.
I didn't know you were here.

75
00:05:15,675 --> 00:05:18,725
No. Lady Grantham sent a message.

76
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:22,160
Why? She's not ill, is she?
Not...ill, exactly.

77
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,320
Would you mind waiting
in the library?

78
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,280
Pregnant?
You needn't be quite so shocked.

79
00:05:34,315 --> 00:05:36,160
Give me a moment.

80
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,405
You haven't been pregnant
for 18 years!

81
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:44,365
And I'm pregnant now! I don't see
what we've done differently.

82
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,880
Stop right there! If you want to know
more, go and offer the doctor some whisky.

83
00:05:47,915 --> 00:05:49,760
I can't take it in.

84
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,400
But...you're pleased?

85
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,240
Of course... Of course I'm pleased.

86
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,800
I didn't think she'd do it.

87
00:06:10,835 --> 00:06:13,085
I told you she would.

88
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,125
I could see she was interested.

89
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,660
I was speaking as one lady's maid
to another. That means something!

90
00:06:18,695 --> 00:06:22,160
Course, we thought we had him
before but he's a slippery devil.

91
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,680
It's unusual, obviously.

92
00:06:31,715 --> 00:06:34,120
Unusual? It's Biblical!

93
00:06:34,155 --> 00:06:36,000
Not quite.

94
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,100
You understand that women
go through a...certain change.

95
00:06:41,135 --> 00:06:44,760
Thank you. I know quite as much
as I need to about all that.

96
00:06:44,795 --> 00:06:48,920
Well, sometimes it can result in
a surge of...

97
00:06:48,955 --> 00:06:51,885
fertility,
for want of a better word.

98
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:55,120
But the child will be healthy?
There's no reason why not.

99
00:06:55,155 --> 00:06:57,325
How long has she...?

100
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,520
Hard to be precise.
Things had become irregular, but...

101
00:07:01,555 --> 00:07:04,960
Please... I'd say
she's about four months gone.

102
00:07:04,995 --> 00:07:06,880
It'll begin to show soon.

103
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,880
And I don't suppose there's any way
of knowing...if it's a...

104
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,520
I do beg your pardon, my lord.
I thought you were alone.

105
00:07:17,555 --> 00:07:19,680
Please come in, Mrs Hughes.

106
00:07:19,715 --> 00:07:21,045
I'm just leaving.

107
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,365
William?
Well, thank you, Doctor.

108
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,960
I'd better write some letters.
Show Dr Clarkson out.

109
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,440
I didn't want to bother
Her Ladyship if she's not well...

110
00:07:36,475 --> 00:07:38,320
She's resting, but tell me anyway.

111
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,085
It's Mrs Patmore, my lord.

112
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,000
The time has come when we really
have to make a decision.

113
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,400
Hm...

114
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,600
Now do you believe me?
Careful, Thomas.

115
00:07:57,635 --> 00:08:00,005
Your position is not a strong one.

116
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:03,440
Don't punish US, Mr Carson.
It's Mr Bates who's wanting here.

117
00:08:03,475 --> 00:08:05,245
Tell me, do you think it right

118
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,720
a man like that should live and work
at Downton?

119
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,820
Mr Napier, my lady.

120
00:08:35,855 --> 00:08:38,005
What a surprise!

121
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,760
I'm afraid you've just missed
my aunt.

122
00:08:39,795 --> 00:08:41,720
I know.

123
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,285
I watched her leave.

124
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,840
How are your wedding plans going?

125
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:49,765
Not very well.

126
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,480
In fact, we've decided
to call it off.

127
00:08:51,515 --> 00:08:53,765
Really?

128
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,720
It seemed quite fixed
at Sybil's ball.

129
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,560
What a shame... Please.

130
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,565
It'll be better in the long run.
Perhaps.

131
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,920
I know what high hopes you have
of the institution.

132
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,845
The thing is, Lady Mary,
I'm here today

133
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,245
because I needed to tell you
something face to face,

134
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:21,965
before you went to the country.
Face to face? Gracious me.

135
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,640
I've recently heard gossip about the time
when I came to Downton with Kemal Pamuk,

136
00:09:26,675 --> 00:09:30,880
gossip that I believe has made life
difficult for you.

137
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,160
I've also heard it said that
I am the source of these stories.

138
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,280
It is very important to me that
you should know that I am not.

139
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:46,440
From that day to this, I have never
spoken one word on the matter.

140
00:09:46,475 --> 00:09:48,885
Then who did?

141
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,880
It seems to have come from the
Turkish Embassy,

142
00:09:51,915 --> 00:09:54,840
from the Ambassador himself,
in fact, and his wife.

143
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,640
But who told them, if not you?

144
00:09:59,675 --> 00:10:02,125
This is the hard part.

145
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,440
When I discovered the answer,
I debated whether I should relay it,

146
00:10:05,475 --> 00:10:07,560
but in the end,
I feel you ought to know.

147
00:10:07,595 --> 00:10:09,440
The suspense is killing me.

148
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,280
It was your sister, Lady Edith,
who wrote to the Ambassador.

149
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:18,240
That is why people accept the story.

150
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,885
Edith?

151
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,000
It's very hard to believe.

152
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,680
Harder for you than for me.

153
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:38,400
I love the thought of a baby in
the house, but if it's a boy...

154
00:10:38,435 --> 00:10:41,285
It'll be very hard on Mr Crawley.

155
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,765
I know. I was no great champion
when he first arrived.

156
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,440
But it seems to me he's tried his
best and he's done the decent thing.

157
00:10:49,475 --> 00:10:52,397
I can't see THAT coming off.

158
00:10:52,432 --> 00:10:55,285
You don't mean the engagement?

159
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,320
But it's not an engagement yet,
is it?

160
00:10:57,355 --> 00:10:59,480
She'd never throw him over!

161
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:05,240
Mr Carson, Lady Mary Crawley does
not deserve you.

162
00:11:05,275 --> 00:11:06,880
Oh...

163
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:23,700
Wonderful news, of course.
You must look after yourself.

164
00:11:23,735 --> 00:11:27,760
Don't worry. O'Brien has me
wrapped in silk and feathers.

165
00:11:27,795 --> 00:11:29,885
You're lucky.

166
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:34,400
I have a horrible feeling Simmons
is about to hand in her notice.

167
00:11:34,435 --> 00:11:38,045
She's looking very fidgety lately,

168
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,720
and I saw her hurrying
to meet the postman.

169
00:11:40,755 --> 00:11:42,925
Oh, you poor thing.

170
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,400
Is there anything worse
than losing one's maid?

171
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,160
Why would she want to leave me?

172
00:11:49,195 --> 00:11:51,640
I've been as gentle as a lamb.

173
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,360
Most of the time.

174
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,200
I want to say I'll make provision
for you

175
00:12:04,235 --> 00:12:06,160
if it's a boy and you get
pushed out.

176
00:12:06,195 --> 00:12:08,040
Don't worry. I know you can't.

177
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:13,880
If any man living understands the
strength of the entail, it's me.

178
00:12:13,915 --> 00:12:16,480
I can give you Crawley House
for life, if it's a help.

179
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,000
Have you heard from Mary?
No. Have you?

180
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:27,200
By the way, I want to ask a favour.
What's the name of your cook,

181
00:12:27,235 --> 00:12:29,560
the one you brought with you
from Manchester?

182
00:12:29,595 --> 00:12:31,800
Mrs Bird?

183
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:37,400
I'll get it, Mrs Patmore!
Don't fuss me!

184
00:12:37,435 --> 00:12:39,320
Is that everything?
Yeah.

185
00:12:39,355 --> 00:12:41,245
How are you feeling?

186
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:44,720
Well, most people's parents die
before them, and so they should.

187
00:12:44,755 --> 00:12:48,400
Oh, give it a rest. Your mother knew
how to drag it out.

188
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:50,325
What?
Thomas!

189
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:53,525
Get up to the servery.

190
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:57,200
You gave me the wrong cloth!
Sit down, Mrs Patmore.

191
00:12:57,235 --> 00:12:59,360
I can't when I've got
the luncheon to finish!

192
00:12:59,395 --> 00:13:01,800
It was not a suggestion. Sit!

193
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,320
Daisy and I will finish
the luncheon.

194
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,280
So he'll give us this house
for life, will he? How generous

195
00:13:17,315 --> 00:13:20,360
It IS generous. He doesn't have to.

196
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,720
But it's made me think.

197
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,765
You must stay here if you want.

198
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:31,120
But I wonder if it mightn't be better
all round if I went back to Manchester.

199
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,805
It may not be a boy.

200
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:38,400
Oh, really, Mother! You never
approved of it all anyway!

201
00:13:38,435 --> 00:13:40,800
If it is a boy,
you should see it as a release,

202
00:13:40,835 --> 00:13:42,937
not a disappointment.

203
00:13:42,972 --> 00:13:45,040
What does Mary say?

204
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,880
Nothing yet.

205
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,565
You wanted to see Mrs Bird, sir.

206
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:59,800
Yes. Mrs Bird, Lord Grantham has
rather a favour to ask of you.

207
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:05,000
I'm surprised Lord Grantham
knows that I exist, sir.

208
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,120
Huh...

209
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,240
I'm sorry to disturb you.
Quite all right.

210
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:24,520
Mr Bates, it's about your
somewhat startling confession.

211
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,000
As you'll have surmised, His
Lordship has yet to make a decision.

212
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:31,085
His delay is generous.

213
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,760
However, it will be no surprise
to you

214
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:40,125
that Miss O'Brien has been unwilling
to let things drop.

215
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,640
It seems that when we were in
London, she made a new friend -

216
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:47,440
a lady's maid in the house of
a colonel in your former regiment.

217
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:00,000
Please tell me that this account
is false, at least in part.

218
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,680
I wish I could.

219
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,925
I'll have to show this
to His Lordship.

220
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:12,560
Of course you will. I do not like
to play the part of Pontius Pilate,

221
00:15:12,595 --> 00:15:15,165
but I'm afraid I must.

222
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,800
Lord Grantham will decide
what's to be done.

223
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:27,460
Mr Bates, I hope you do not feel
that I treated you unjustly.

224
00:15:27,495 --> 00:15:32,480
On the contrary, Mr Carson,
I am astonished at your kindness.

225
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:50,400
Of all of you, Sybil might find joy
in a cottage, but not you.

226
00:15:50,435 --> 00:15:52,925
We don't know it'll be a boy.
Exactly.

227
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,240
So ask Matthew to wait
until the child is born.

228
00:15:55,275 --> 00:15:57,000
If it's a girl,
you can wed him happily

229
00:15:57,035 --> 00:15:58,685
and all will be as it was before.

230
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,840
But if I delay, won't he think
I'm only after him for his position?

231
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:05,800
Besides, I'm not sure
I want to put him off,

232
00:16:05,835 --> 00:16:08,245
even without the title.

233
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:12,040
We get on so well, you know.
And he's terribly clever.

234
00:16:12,075 --> 00:16:14,280
He might end up Lord Chancellor.

235
00:16:14,315 --> 00:16:16,405
And he might not.

236
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,485
Oh, come along, Mary, be sensible.

237
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,000
Can you really see yourself
dawdling your life away

238
00:16:21,035 --> 00:16:23,400
as the wife of a country solicitor?

239
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,960
But why would we ever want
a telephone at Downton, my lord?

240
00:16:33,995 --> 00:16:36,045
Well, they have their uses.

241
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,000
You could speak to the housekeeper
in London.

242
00:16:38,035 --> 00:16:39,565
That'd be helpful, surely?

243
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,960
I hope I have not failed in my
management of the recent move?

244
00:16:42,995 --> 00:16:46,485
Not at all.
But the telephone is here now,

245
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:49,165
and the girls got used to it
when we were in London.

246
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,440
Besides, none of us know what
the next few months will bring.

247
00:16:52,475 --> 00:16:54,725
Because of the Archduke's death?

248
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,760
Austria won't get what it wants
from Serbia.

249
00:16:56,795 --> 00:16:58,965
And now Russia's starting to rumble.

250
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,140
Well, there's not much we can do
about that.

251
00:17:01,175 --> 00:17:03,280
So, will you take care of
the telephone man?

252
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:08,325
Oh, about Mr Bates, my lord.

253
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:12,040
I expect you've had time to consider
the contents of that letter?

254
00:17:12,075 --> 00:17:15,040
Yes. But I find it very odd.

255
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:16,965
Regimental silver?

256
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,200
I could more easily see Bates as
an assassin than a petty pilferer.

257
00:17:20,235 --> 00:17:23,957
I agree. And while the letter
is hard to argue with,

258
00:17:23,992 --> 00:17:27,680
I wouldn't put anything past
Thomas or Miss O'Brien.

259
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,845
So, what did we miss?
Nothing much.

260
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,960
Although you'd have had
more invitations than I did.

261
00:17:44,995 --> 00:17:47,645
Have you thought about Matthew?
Of course.

262
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:51,440
But Aunt Rosamund says - She's
written to me. Pay no attention.

263
00:17:51,475 --> 00:17:55,200
But Granny, she has got a point.
Mary can't be completely naive.

264
00:17:55,235 --> 00:17:59,017
I don't need your help, thank you.
Mary, listen to me.

265
00:17:59,052 --> 00:18:02,800
If you take Matthew now,
when his whole future is at risk,

266
00:18:02,835 --> 00:18:05,240
he will love you
to the end of his days.

267
00:18:05,275 --> 00:18:07,405
Why, Granny, you're a romantic!

268
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,925
I've been called many things,
but never that.

269
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:13,200
And what happens if the baby is
a boy and Matthew loses everything?

270
00:18:13,235 --> 00:18:16,160
Mary can always change her mind.
I can't do that to Matthew.

271
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:18,437
It's not how we are together.
Huh...

272
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:20,680
I'm going upstairs
to help Anna unpack.

273
00:18:20,715 --> 00:18:22,640
I'll come with you.

274
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,920
Edith, why don't you go too?

275
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,200
Sir Anthony Strallan
was at Lady Wren's party.

276
00:18:36,235 --> 00:18:37,960
He asked after you.

277
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:50,360
Is she really serious about him?
Any port in a storm...

278
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,880
By the way,
I must write about my maid.

279
00:18:54,915 --> 00:18:57,880
She's leaving, to get married.

280
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,205
How could she be so selfish?
I do sympathise.

281
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,240
Robert's always wanted me to get rid
of O'Brien, but I can't face it.

282
00:19:05,275 --> 00:19:07,125
Anyway, she's so fond of me.

283
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,080
Well, I thought Simmons
was fond of ME!

284
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,645
What am I to do?

285
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,525
I'll put an advertisement
in The Lady.

286
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:18,400
It's always the best place to start.
Oh! That's so kind.

287
00:19:18,435 --> 00:19:20,245
Thank you.

288
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,325
I really must be going.

289
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:25,200
Now, don't let Mary wait for
the baby

290
00:19:25,235 --> 00:19:28,040
before she gives Matthew her answer.

291
00:19:28,075 --> 00:19:31,125
I'm sure it's another girl.

292
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:34,800
I know those men
of the moral high ground.

293
00:19:34,835 --> 00:19:38,777
If she won't say yes
when he might be poor,

294
00:19:38,812 --> 00:19:42,720
he won't want her
when he will be rich.

295
00:19:42,755 --> 00:19:45,165
Maybe we should knit something.

296
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,480
Oh, yes, I'm sure they'd love
a pair of bootees knitted by you.

297
00:19:48,515 --> 00:19:52,217
Or what about a Christening mug?
They can buy their own silver.

298
00:19:52,252 --> 00:19:55,920
Anything in the paper? They've
arrested Princip and his gang.

299
00:19:55,955 --> 00:19:58,285
All Serbian
and members of the Black Hand.

300
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,880
The Black Hand? I don't like
the sound of that.

301
00:20:00,915 --> 00:20:02,565
I don't like the sound
of any of it.

302
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,240
War is on the way.
Then we'll have to face it...

303
00:20:05,275 --> 00:20:07,880
as bravely as we can.
Thank you, Mr Cannon Fodder.

304
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:09,925
Don't YOU think a war's coming?

305
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,800
Oh, there'll be a war,
and it's time to prepare for it.

306
00:20:12,835 --> 00:20:15,760
The country, do you mean?
No. Me.

307
00:20:15,795 --> 00:20:18,885
You never disappoint.

308
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,765
Daisy, run and find Mrs Patmore.

309
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,925
His Lordship wants to see her
in the library.

310
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,520
His Lordship wants Mrs Patmore
to go up to the library?

311
00:20:26,555 --> 00:20:28,805
That is what I said.

312
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,640
And Anna, you're to come too.

313
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:38,880
And we thought the assassination
of an archduke was a surprise.

314
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,840
Mrs Patmore, my lord.

315
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:55,280
Your Lordship, I know things haven't
been quite right for a while,

316
00:20:55,315 --> 00:20:57,320
but I can assure you -
Come in, Mrs Patmore.

317
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:03,680
I promise you, my lord, if I could
just be allowed a bit more time...

318
00:21:03,715 --> 00:21:06,520
Mrs Patmore, I have not asked you
here to give you your notice.

319
00:21:06,555 --> 00:21:09,165
Haven't you?
No.

320
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,420
I understand you've had some trouble
with your sight. That's just it!

321
00:21:12,455 --> 00:21:15,640
I know I could manage better if -
Please, Mrs Patmore! Let him speak!

322
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,640
Beg pardon, my lord.
Don't apologise.

323
00:21:19,675 --> 00:21:21,645
Now, on Dr Clarkson's
recommendation,

324
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,960
I'm sending you up to London to see
an eye specialist at Moorfields.

325
00:21:24,995 --> 00:21:27,880
Anna will go with you and you'll
stay with my sister Rosamund

326
00:21:27,915 --> 00:21:29,920
in her new house in Belgrave Square.

327
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,280
I'm afraid I'm going to have to sit
in your presence, my lord.

328
00:21:34,315 --> 00:21:36,160
Of course.

329
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,920
But how will you get on here?

330
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:47,445
Well, Mrs Crawley is lending us
her cook - Mrs Bird.

331
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:51,240
She's coming over tomorrow. You will be
good enough to show her how things work.

332
00:21:51,275 --> 00:21:53,520
Are the Crawleys to starve
while I'm away?

333
00:21:53,555 --> 00:21:55,805
They'll eat here every evening.

334
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,445
Now, my sister's butler
will look after you.

335
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,480
He's very nice. Anna,
you won't mind a visit to London?

336
00:22:01,515 --> 00:22:04,720
No, my lord. Thank you.
It'll be an adventure.

337
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,040
One with a happy ending, I hope.

338
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:21,800
At Sybil's ball you said you'd give
me your answer the day you got back,

339
00:22:21,835 --> 00:22:24,680
and now you say you will not!
Why do we have to rush into it?

340
00:22:24,715 --> 00:22:28,120
I need to be sure, that's all.
But you WERE sure.

341
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,820
I know what has altered you.
My prospects!

342
00:22:30,855 --> 00:22:32,845
Because nothing else has changed!
No! Yes!

343
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,480
If your mother's child is a boy,
then he's the heir

344
00:22:35,515 --> 00:22:37,965
and I go back to living on my wits!

345
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,480
You always make everything
so black and white!

346
00:22:40,515 --> 00:22:43,725
I think this IS black and white!

347
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,880
Do you love me enough
to spend your life with me?

348
00:22:45,915 --> 00:22:49,045
If not, then say no.

349
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:52,560
If you do, then say yes.
I want to...

350
00:22:52,595 --> 00:22:55,157
Granny told me I should say yes now,

351
00:22:55,192 --> 00:22:57,720
then withdraw
if you lost everything.

352
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,480
To make that work,
you'd have to be a good liar.

353
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:08,520
Are you a good liar?
Not good enough to try, apparently.

354
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:18,040
How could you not have realised
they'd discover the loss at once?

355
00:23:18,075 --> 00:23:19,920
And to keep them in your house...

356
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,965
But you only served two years?
That's right, my lord.

357
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,640
So, clearly the judge thought
there was some mitigating factor.

358
00:23:29,675 --> 00:23:31,640
I just want to know the truth.

359
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,525
I cannot speak of it, my lord.

360
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,445
You must decide whether I stay or go

361
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:40,440
on the basis of the evidence
before you.

362
00:23:40,475 --> 00:23:42,320
I will respect that.

363
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:51,045
I'm sorry. I don't believe it.

364
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:54,040
How can you say that?
When I've confessed to the crime?

365
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,680
His Lordship obviously doesn't think
that's all there is to it,

366
00:23:58,715 --> 00:24:00,445
and I don't either.

367
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,640
Anna, are you set for the nine
o'clock train tomorrow?

368
00:24:03,675 --> 00:24:05,125
All packed and ready.

369
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:08,640
You'll be met at King's Cross by
Lady Rosamund's chauffeur,

370
00:24:08,675 --> 00:24:12,537
which I think is generous, but after
that, you're on your own.

371
00:24:12,572 --> 00:24:16,400
I must get on. I'm acting referee
for Mrs Patmore and Mrs Bird.

372
00:24:16,435 --> 00:24:18,320
Best of luck.

373
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:27,885
Will you miss me?

374
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,720
Try not to miss me.
It'll be good practice.

375
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:40,160
I expect it'll be hard adjusting
to this kitchen,

376
00:24:40,195 --> 00:24:42,897
after the one you're used to.
Not to worry.

377
00:24:42,932 --> 00:24:45,600
I'm sure I can have it cleaned up
in no time.

378
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:49,525
Cleaned up?
I'm not criticising.

379
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:53,120
With your eyesight, it's a wonder
you could see the pots at all.

380
00:24:53,155 --> 00:24:57,285
You'll have met Daisy and the
others? I have.

381
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,160
Though what they all find to do
is a mystery to me.

382
00:25:00,195 --> 00:25:03,445
Are you not used to managing
staff, Mrs Bird?

383
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:08,220
I'm used to getting it done with
one kitchen maid, Mrs Patmore,

384
00:25:08,255 --> 00:25:12,960
but I suppose, in a house like
this, you expect to take it easy.

385
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:18,600
Do you think we should erect
a ring and let them fight it out?

386
00:25:18,635 --> 00:25:20,845
She's all right, Mrs Bird.

387
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,640
She's more of a general
than a trooper,

388
00:25:22,675 --> 00:25:25,285
but you need that in a cook.

389
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:28,760
Mrs Patmore's the Generalissimo.

390
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,120
Well, I'm very sad.

391
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,960
I thought Mary was made of better
stuff.

392
00:25:40,995 --> 00:25:42,840
Don't speak against her.

393
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,640
of course, she's taken advice from
someone with false and greedy values.

394
00:25:47,675 --> 00:25:50,717
Mother! And we don't have to go too
far to know who that is!

395
00:25:50,752 --> 00:25:53,760
I've a good mind - You do not go
near Violet. That is an order.

396
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,965
Something's not right about it.
I agree.

397
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,640
Having a silver thief in the house
does not seem right at all,

398
00:26:01,675 --> 00:26:03,160
even if he COULD walk.

399
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:07,125
But Carson isn't keen
to get rid of him either,

400
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,760
and he normally comes down on this
sort of thing very hard.

401
00:26:09,795 --> 00:26:13,485
What's his reasoning?
He blames Thomas and O'Brien.

402
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,725
He says they've been working against
Bates since he got here.

403
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:20,520
So I should sack O'Brien instead?
You'll hear no argument from me.

404
00:26:20,555 --> 00:26:23,480
This should do the trick, my lady.

405
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:30,020
Ten years of my life,
That's what I've given her.

406
00:26:30,055 --> 00:26:32,925
Ten bloody years!
But did she say she'd sack you?

407
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,160
It's obviously what he wants.
So when will they tell you?

408
00:26:36,195 --> 00:26:37,965
When they've found a replacement.

409
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,100
Heaven forefend she should have to
put a comb through her own hair!

410
00:26:42,135 --> 00:26:46,200
And if I'm going, you won't be far
behind. Oh, so what? Sod 'em.

411
00:26:46,235 --> 00:26:48,565
There's a war coming
and war means change.

412
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,885
We should be making plans.
What are you talking about?

413
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,600
Well, put it like this. I don't want
to be a footman any more,

414
00:26:54,635 --> 00:26:57,120
but I don't intend to be killed
in battle neither.

415
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:07,725
I'm not saying poison them!

416
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:11,000
Just make sure they don't find
her food all that agreeable.

417
00:27:11,035 --> 00:27:13,920
By poisoning it?
Will you stop that?

418
00:27:13,955 --> 00:27:16,485
You don't want it to taste nice.

419
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:19,960
I want them to be glad
when I get back, that's all.

420
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:25,040
Huh...

421
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,020
Good afternoon, Carson.
Is Lady Edith in? I am!

422
00:27:50,055 --> 00:27:53,285
I most certainly am!
I was just driving past. Yes?

423
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:56,760
I thought you might like to come
for a spin. If you're not too busy.

424
00:27:56,795 --> 00:28:00,440
Wait till I get my coat. Is it
all right if I make some notes?

425
00:28:00,475 --> 00:28:04,800
I'm so sorry, Mr...?
This is Mr Bromidge, my lady.

426
00:28:04,835 --> 00:28:06,645
He's here about the telephone.

427
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:09,405
Oh, please make your notes,
dear Mr Bromidge.

428
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,920
We're so looking forward to it.
What an exciting business to be in!

429
00:28:12,955 --> 00:28:15,680
You must be expanding every day.
Oh, we are, sir.

430
00:28:15,715 --> 00:28:18,125
But that brings its problems.

431
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:21,960
Training up men for the work,
when many have no aptitude.

432
00:28:21,995 --> 00:28:24,640
I can't even find a secretary
who can keep pace.

433
00:28:24,675 --> 00:28:27,280
What?
It's hard with a new concept.

434
00:28:27,315 --> 00:28:29,565
Too old, and they can't change.

435
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,525
Too young,
and they've no experience.

436
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:34,205
Have you filled the post yet?
I know just the woman.

437
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,560
Well, she must hurry up.
We'll close the list tomorrow night.

438
00:28:37,595 --> 00:28:39,880
You'll have her application.
I promise.

439
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:58,680
This isn't bad at all, is it?
I don't know.

440
00:28:58,715 --> 00:29:01,640
No-one told me
there'd be an actual operation.

441
00:29:01,675 --> 00:29:03,605
What did you think?

442
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:06,520
They were just going to make magic
passes over your eyes?

443
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,660
All right, Mrs...Patmore?

444
00:29:10,695 --> 00:29:13,245
She'll be fine. Thank you.

445
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:16,440
And you've been sent to us
by the Earl of Grantham?

446
00:29:16,475 --> 00:29:20,645
That's right.
Very good. You can leave now.

447
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:23,760
We'll keep her in for a week.
You can collect her next Friday.

448
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:32,200
I'll be in to visit every day.
What about the rest of the time?

449
00:29:32,235 --> 00:29:34,120
Don't worry!

450
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,800
You'll be fine.

451
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:31,685
Bates, you say?
John Bates.

452
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:34,160
He must have left the army
about eight years ago.

453
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,440
Wait here, please.

454
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:54,080
Have you finished the soup?
I think so, Mrs Bird.

455
00:30:54,115 --> 00:30:56,520
And the sauce for the fish?
Yes, Mrs Bird.

456
00:30:56,555 --> 00:30:58,400
You can put them in the warmer.

457
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,660
You don't mean John Bates,
who went to prison for theft?

458
00:31:32,695 --> 00:31:36,320
That's correct. Well, I know who
he is right enough.

459
00:31:36,355 --> 00:31:39,677
That was an odd business.

460
00:31:39,712 --> 00:31:42,965
Why odd?
Never mind.

461
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,040
So you're his cousin
and you'd like to be in touch?

462
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,685
Very forgiving.

463
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,605
I've got no address for him
or his wife.

464
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:55,360
But I have got one for his mother,
which should still be good.

465
00:31:55,395 --> 00:31:57,360
I've written it down for you.

466
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,960
Thank you for your trouble.

467
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:18,000
Is it true you wrote to the
Turkish Ambassador about Kemal?

468
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,400
Who told you?
Someone who knows that you did.

469
00:32:21,435 --> 00:32:24,125
Then why are you asking?

470
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:27,000
Because I wanted to give you one
last chance to deny it.

471
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:33,040
And what if I did? He had a right
to know how his countryman died.

472
00:32:33,075 --> 00:32:34,720
In the arms of a slut.

473
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,480
How's that advertisement getting on
for new maid?

474
00:32:50,515 --> 00:32:53,125
Well, it's only just come out.

475
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:58,160
We can manage here now. Tell Mrs Bird
we'll have our dinner in 20 minutes.

476
00:32:58,195 --> 00:33:01,680
Carson, be sure to say to Mrs Bird
the dinner was really delicious.

477
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:14,720
So, how was the drive?
It was lovely.

478
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:18,360
Only... Yes?

479
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,740
Well, he said he had a question
for me.

480
00:33:23,775 --> 00:33:26,720
He told me he'd ask it
at the garden party

481
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:29,800
and he hoped I'd say yes.

482
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,420
You must think very carefully
what your answer will be.

483
00:33:36,455 --> 00:33:39,880
Yes, I should think very carefully
about a lot of things.

484
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:45,240
Do your neighbours have one?
Yes, they do.

485
00:33:45,275 --> 00:33:46,965
It seems wise to get a telephone
now.

486
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,920
If there is a war, it may be hard
to have one installed in a house.

487
00:33:49,955 --> 00:33:51,760
Let me show you where
we're going to put it.

488
00:33:51,795 --> 00:33:55,365
First electricity now telephones.

489
00:33:55,400 --> 00:34:00,040
Sometimes I feel as if I were living
in an HG Wells novel.

490
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:06,000
But the young are all so calm about
change, aren't they?

491
00:34:06,035 --> 00:34:10,080
Look at Matthew. I do admire him.

492
00:34:10,115 --> 00:34:12,000
Do you?

493
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:17,080
What have I done wrong now?
Oh, please.

494
00:34:17,115 --> 00:34:19,640
Don't pretend Mary's sudden
reluctance

495
00:34:19,675 --> 00:34:21,685
can't be traced back to you.

496
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:25,160
Well, I shall pretend it.
I told her to take him.

497
00:34:25,195 --> 00:34:28,600
Your quarrel is with my daughter
Rosamund, not me.

498
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,360
So put that in your pipe
and smoke it!

499
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:45,005
Mr Molesley. What are you after?

500
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,600
I want a word with Mr Carson.
I'm here to have my dinner.

501
00:34:47,635 --> 00:34:50,800
You don't want much, do you?
What are you doing?

502
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:56,440
Mr Carson dropped his wallet in
the passage. I was replacing it.

503
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,920
But everything seemed so settled
between you at Sybil's ball.

504
00:35:08,955 --> 00:35:12,240
Things have changed since then.

505
00:35:12,275 --> 00:35:14,405
Not necessarily.

506
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:17,245
I don't seem to be much good
at making boys.

507
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:21,080
Any more than I'm much good at
building my life on shifting sands.

508
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:27,320
You do know I should be very proud
to have you as my son-in-law,

509
00:35:27,355 --> 00:35:29,200
whatever your prospects?

510
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,800
Unfortunately, sir, your daughter
is more practical than you.

511
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,940
Will you join us, Mrs Bird?
I don't mind if I do.

512
00:35:41,975 --> 00:35:44,787
I'm not sure Mrs Patmore would
like that, Mr Carson.

513
00:35:44,822 --> 00:35:47,600
Cook always
eats separate, that's what she says.

514
00:35:47,635 --> 00:35:50,120
Not in our house.
There's only four of us.

515
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:54,720
Well, you're going any minute. She's
advertised for your replacement.

516
00:35:54,755 --> 00:35:56,640
That filthy, ungrateful cow.

517
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:02,200
Let the kitchen maids have theirs
on their own. You stay with us.

518
00:36:02,235 --> 00:36:05,880
Her Ladyship said to tell you
that the dinner was delicious.

519
00:36:05,915 --> 00:36:10,000
She can't have!
Daisy? Does that surprise you?

520
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:31,480
What have you done with this,
you little beggar? I knew it!

521
00:36:31,515 --> 00:36:34,440
That's why I said it was for
upstairs.

522
00:36:34,475 --> 00:36:36,440
Come on! Tell us what's in it!

523
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:40,720
Just...water and a bit of soap.

524
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:48,440
And you've put something
in the fish sauce as well?

525
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:52,280
Only...mustard and aniseed.

526
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:56,640
Why, Daisy?
Why would you do such a thing?

527
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:02,000
Mrs Patmore was worried they'd
prefer Mrs Bird's cooking

528
00:37:02,035 --> 00:37:05,560
and they wouldn't want her
to come back. Is that likely?

529
00:37:05,595 --> 00:37:07,960
When they've taken such trouble
to get her well?

530
00:37:07,995 --> 00:37:09,840
I'm sorry!

531
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,365
There, there.

532
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,085
There are worse crimes on earth
than loyalty.

533
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:27,880
Dry your eyes, and fetch the beef
stew I was making for tomorrow.

534
00:37:27,915 --> 00:37:30,880
You've not had a chance to spoil
that, I suppose?

535
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:33,480
I was going to mix in
some syrup of figs,

536
00:37:33,515 --> 00:37:35,360
but I've not done it yet

537
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,760
At least we'd all have been regular.

538
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,005
Carson said you were here.

539
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:47,765
Just checking that everything's
being done right, my lady.

540
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:51,720
Only, we never heard back. That is,
Miss Dawson never heard back,

541
00:37:51,755 --> 00:37:53,525
about an interview.

542
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:56,685
Er, yes, we got the young lady's
letter.

543
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:00,800
But the trouble is, she didn't have
any obvious experience of hard work.

544
00:38:00,835 --> 00:38:04,677
But she's a very hard worker!
I couldn't find any proof of it.

545
00:38:04,712 --> 00:38:08,520
And she gave you as a reference,
when you don't run a business,

546
00:38:08,555 --> 00:38:11,365
well, not that I'm aware of.

547
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:14,680
Lily? Can you find Gwen and tell her
to come to the hall now?

548
00:38:14,715 --> 00:38:16,445
Yes, my lady.

549
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,420
The reason Gwen didn't give
any more details

550
00:38:19,455 --> 00:38:22,167
is because she works here,
as a housemaid.

551
00:38:22,202 --> 00:38:24,880
Ah! And you thought
that'd put me off?

552
00:38:24,915 --> 00:38:26,805
But she's taken a postal course

553
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:30,720
and has good speeds in typing
and Pitman shorthand. Test her!

554
00:38:30,755 --> 00:38:33,800
I will, if I like the look of her.

555
00:38:33,835 --> 00:38:35,725
Ah, so, young lady.

556
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:39,320
You thought I'd turn up my nose
at a housemaid?

557
00:38:39,355 --> 00:38:42,880
Well, I did, sir.
Well, my mother was a housemaid.

558
00:38:42,915 --> 00:38:45,045
I've got nothing against housemaids.

559
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:47,800
They know about hard work and
long hour, that's for sure.

560
00:38:47,835 --> 00:38:49,725
I believe so, sir.

561
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,680
Right, well, is there somewhere
we could talk?

562
00:38:52,715 --> 00:38:54,720
Gwen, take Mr Bromidge to the
library.

563
00:38:54,755 --> 00:38:56,640
I'll see no-one disturbs you.

564
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,800
Sorry, Papa, you can't go in there.

565
00:39:09,835 --> 00:39:11,965
Why on earth not?

566
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,240
Gwen's in there with Mr Bromidge.
She's being interviewed.

567
00:39:15,275 --> 00:39:17,685
I cannot use my library

568
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:20,800
because one of the housemaids is in
there applying for another job?

569
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:24,720
That's about the size of it.

570
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,600
So, what is it you want to know?

571
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:40,040
I want to know the truth about
the case against him.

572
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,520
I want to know why the officer
thought it was 'odd'.

573
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,400
I want to know what Mr Bates isn't
saying.

574
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,960
Because you don't believe him
to be guilty?

575
00:39:50,995 --> 00:39:53,237
No, I don't.

576
00:39:53,272 --> 00:39:55,480
I know he's not.

577
00:39:55,515 --> 00:39:57,400
Well...

578
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:01,000
You're right, of course.

579
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:06,000
Then who was it? Who was the thief?

580
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:10,000
His wife. Vera.

581
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,520
Who do you call?
No-one you know has got one!

582
00:40:15,555 --> 00:40:17,925
But they will have. You'll see.

583
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:21,320
Might I enquire why my pantry
has become a common room?

584
00:40:21,355 --> 00:40:24,285
Sorry, Mr Carson.

585
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:27,320
But...do you know how it works?

586
00:40:27,355 --> 00:40:30,285
Of course I do.
Could you show us?

587
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:33,485
Certainly not.
A telephone is not a toy,

588
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:36,840
but a useful and valuable tool.
Now, get back to your work.

589
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:06,120
She worked at the barracks sometimes,
helping at big dinners and so on.

590
00:41:06,155 --> 00:41:09,040
That night her opportunity came
and she took it.

591
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,765
They knew it was her.

592
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,040
Someone even saw her
with a big carryall.

593
00:41:15,075 --> 00:41:17,200
But why did he confess?

594
00:41:17,235 --> 00:41:19,080
Well...

595
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,645
John wasn't the same man in those
days.

596
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:27,560
The African war had shaken him up
and made him angry.

597
00:41:27,595 --> 00:41:29,565
He'd been wounded

598
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,800
and he drunk a lot more than was good
for him.

599
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:40,645
Was he violent?
No. No, not violent.

600
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:44,480
He could hard at times,
with a tongue like a razor.

601
00:41:44,515 --> 00:41:47,760
He felt he'd ruined Vera's life,
Miss Smith.

602
00:41:47,795 --> 00:41:50,400
Do you agree with him?

603
00:41:50,435 --> 00:41:52,125
No.

604
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:55,120
I thought she was a nasty
piece of work.

605
00:41:55,155 --> 00:41:58,120
That's why he took the blame.

606
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:05,160
Surely, if everyone knew he was
innocent... But he confessed!

607
00:42:05,195 --> 00:42:08,920
There was nothing anybody could do
once he'd confessed.

608
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,085
Could I ask you something, sir?

609
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:19,320
Only, I get the feeling that
a war's on the way.

610
00:42:19,355 --> 00:42:21,205
I'm afraid we all do.

611
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:24,080
And when it comes, I want to be
really useful to my country.

612
00:42:24,115 --> 00:42:25,965
How heartening.
So I've been thinking,

613
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,520
what could be more useful
than what you do?

614
00:42:28,555 --> 00:42:31,040
Bringing people back to health,
back to life.

615
00:42:31,075 --> 00:42:33,005
I see.

616
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,685
Well, erm, we are looking for
volunteers

617
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:38,005
to train for the
Territorial Force hospitals,

618
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:40,845
if that's what you mean.
It's exactly what I mean.

619
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:44,400
Will you not be missed here? Maybe.
But we'll all be going, won't we?

620
00:42:44,435 --> 00:42:46,365
The younger men, anyway.

621
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,320
As you wish. I'll make enquiries.

622
00:42:49,355 --> 00:42:51,200
Thank you very much, Doctor.

623
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:58,440
Mr Molesley walked in and there
he was, as bold as brass,

624
00:42:58,475 --> 00:43:00,440
taking my wallet
out of my change coat.

625
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:05,120
Mr Molesley would have no reason
to make it up, my lord.

626
00:43:05,155 --> 00:43:07,717
He doesn't know Thomas.
Why would he lie?

627
00:43:07,752 --> 00:43:10,280
So Thomas has been caught
red-handed.

628
00:43:10,315 --> 00:43:12,005
Well, we knew he was a thief.

629
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:14,880
And now we have unimpeachable proof.

630
00:43:14,915 --> 00:43:16,885
I'm afraid he has to go.

631
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:19,325
Oh, I hate this sort of thing,

632
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:21,485
with Lady Grantham's condition
and so on.

633
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:25,180
Can we at least wait
until after the garden party?

634
00:43:25,215 --> 00:43:28,840
Very well, my lord.
But then I think we must act.

635
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:35,925
How long will you wear them?
A week or so.

636
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:38,285
But I can see much better already,
even with them on.

637
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:43,120
Thank heaven. Now, we need to talk
about the garden party.

638
00:43:43,155 --> 00:43:46,605
Mrs Bird and I have made some lists.
Mrs Bird?

639
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:49,680
I think we can manage
without any help from Mrs Bird.

640
00:43:49,715 --> 00:43:51,805
Can you?

641
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:56,040
Well, if you want your garden party to be
run by Blind Pugh, that's your business.

642
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:01,640
Mrs Patmore, there's a lot to be done
and you're only just up on your feet.

643
00:44:01,675 --> 00:44:05,080
We really cannot manage
without Mrs Bird. If you say so.

644
00:44:05,115 --> 00:44:07,605
Now, I've been checking the stores

645
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:10,685
and I've ordered what you'll need
for the baking.

646
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:15,200
That's very kind, Mrs Hughes, but
I believe WE should check the stores,

647
00:44:15,235 --> 00:44:17,085
when it's convenient.

648
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:19,125
Mrs Bird, at Downton Abbey,

649
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:22,660
the housekeeper manages the store
cupboard, but -

650
00:44:22,695 --> 00:44:26,125
I've never not run my own store
cupboard in my life.

651
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:30,000
Separate the cook from the store
cupboard? Where's the sense in that?

652
00:44:30,035 --> 00:44:33,045
How long have I been saying this,
oh, Lord?

653
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:37,940
We're the ones who cook it.
We should be the ones to order it.

654
00:44:37,975 --> 00:44:42,800
Mrs Bird, I shall be very glad of
your help with the garden party.

655
00:44:42,835 --> 00:44:46,200
I'm sure we can manage it easily...
between the two of us.

656
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:02,845
Hello?

657
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,765
This is Downton Abbey.

658
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,720
Carson the butler speaking.

659
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:15,805
Hello.

660
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:19,180
This is Mr Carson,
the butler, of Downton Abbey.

661
00:45:19,215 --> 00:45:22,520
To whom am I speaking?

662
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:26,080
But I'm not shouting!

663
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:28,720
Who are YOU?

664
00:45:28,755 --> 00:45:30,725
Oh. Mrs Gaunt.

665
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:32,640
No, I don't want to place a call.

666
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,320
I was practising my answer.

667
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:41,960
Well, I daresay a lot of the things
you do sound stupid to other people!

668
00:45:41,995 --> 00:45:46,845
I've written to your mother.
She's very anxious, naturally.

669
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:51,560
She suggested coming over. Oh, God.
Well, that's what I thought.

670
00:45:51,595 --> 00:45:54,720
So I put her off. Told her to come
and admire the baby.

671
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,885
I'll just run Your Ladyship's bath.
Thank you, O'Brien.

672
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:03,480
Oh, have you had any answers about
the position? Quite a few.

673
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:12,820
So what did they sound like?
One I think has real possibilities.

674
00:46:12,855 --> 00:46:16,600
She learned to do hair in Paris
while working for the Ambassadress.

675
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,920
Oh, sounds promising.

676
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:26,440
Carson, I've been meaning...
Your Lordship? Oh!

677
00:46:26,475 --> 00:46:30,000
Anna, you're back safely, then?
Yes, thank you, my lord.

678
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:36,200
And Mrs Patmore's fighting fit
again. 'Fighting fit' is the phrase!

679
00:46:36,235 --> 00:46:38,165
Is something the matter?

680
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:41,080
I wanted to see Your Lordship
because... Please.

681
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:48,440
While I was in London, I learned
something about Mr Bates.

682
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:52,600
Not bad, I hope.
No. Not bad at all.

683
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:59,000
I'd have told Mr Carson, but I thought
you might like to hear it from me first.

684
00:46:59,035 --> 00:47:03,280
Go on. I went to call on Mr Bates's
mother.

685
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:15,160
O'Brien, how long do you think it
takes a lady's maid to settle in?

686
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:20,360
Depends on the maid, my lady.
Of course it does.

687
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:24,960
Oops! Sorry.

688
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:39,440
The other half's under the bath.
Never mind. Thank you.

689
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:45,720
I'll just go and sort out
your clothes, my lady. Thank you.

690
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:03,440
Sarah O'Brien,
this is not who you are.

691
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:08,360
My lady, if you could just wait...

692
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:24,960
The doctor's gone, Your Lordship,
but he's coming back after dinner.

693
00:48:24,995 --> 00:48:27,200
Lady Mary's with her now.

694
00:48:27,235 --> 00:48:29,080
Thank you.

695
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:33,045
I don't suppose
you'll want to change.

696
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:36,000
But is there anything
else I can do to be useful?

697
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:39,240
It was a boy.

698
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:47,680
I'm sorry.
I don't mean to embarrass you.

699
00:48:47,715 --> 00:48:50,205
I'm not embarrassed.

700
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:52,240
I just wish
you could have been spared this.

701
00:48:52,275 --> 00:48:53,920
I know you do.

702
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:58,565
Thank you.

703
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:01,560
By the way, Anna's told me what
she learned in London.

704
00:49:01,595 --> 00:49:03,725
Has she?

705
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:05,880
She's not told me.

706
00:49:05,915 --> 00:49:07,805
Oh.

707
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:10,120
Well, the good news is
you won't be leaving Downton.

708
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:14,640
And I need some good news today.

709
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,680
That poor wee babe.

710
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:33,725
How's Her Ladyship doing?

711
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:35,820
I'll take her up a tray
in a minute,

712
00:49:35,855 --> 00:49:37,880
but I dare say she won't touch
a bite.

713
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:41,120
What about you, Miss O'Brien?

714
00:49:41,155 --> 00:49:43,485
What about me?

715
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,760
It must have been quite a shock.

716
00:49:45,795 --> 00:49:47,725
Oh. Yes. Yes, it was.

717
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:50,620
I think you'd better dine with us,
Mr Branson.

718
00:49:50,655 --> 00:49:53,480
We can't know
if you might be needed later.

719
00:49:53,515 --> 00:49:55,360
I'm to go for the doctor at ten.

720
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:01,400
What a long-faced lot!

721
00:50:01,435 --> 00:50:04,005
Kindly show some respect.

722
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:07,240
She'll get over it. They're no
bigger than a hamster at that stage.

723
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:10,645
Will you shut up?

724
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:13,565
I agree. What is the matter
with you, Thomas?

725
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:16,480
I don't know. I suppose all
this makes me feel claustrophobic.

726
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:20,700
I'm sorry, of course I am,
but why must we live through them?

727
00:50:20,735 --> 00:50:23,720
They're just our employers.
They're not our flesh and blood.

728
00:50:23,755 --> 00:50:25,525
Thomas, don't be so unkind.

729
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:28,480
Is there nothing left on earth
that you respect?

730
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,720
Hark at him. Blimey, if he carries
on like this for the unborn baby

731
00:50:33,755 --> 00:50:35,765
of a woman who scarcely knows
his name,

732
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:38,360
no wonder he fell to pieces
when his old mum snuffed it.

733
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:49,280
Thomas! William! That is enough!

734
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:48,840
Oh, Thomas.

735
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:54,045
I've done as I promised.

736
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:56,920
General Burton is commanding
a division at Richmond.

737
00:51:56,955 --> 00:51:59,517
I think I may have a place there
for you.

738
00:51:59,552 --> 00:52:02,045
And Colonel Cartwright.
These are the papers.

739
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:06,000
When you're ready,
pop to the local recruiting office

740
00:52:06,035 --> 00:52:08,125
and they'll take it from there.

741
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:11,120
As a matter of fact, I'm being
drafted back in as a Captain

742
00:52:11,155 --> 00:52:13,237
so I'll try to keep an eye on you.

743
00:52:13,272 --> 00:52:15,285
That's very kind of you, Doctor.

744
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:17,240
With any luck,
there may be some advantage

745
00:52:17,275 --> 00:52:18,920
in your having volunteered so early.

746
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:25,600
Hang on a minute. Now give me yours
and take this one at the same time.

747
00:52:25,635 --> 00:52:27,725
I'm sorry I've been
unkind to you lately.

748
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:30,140
That's all right. I don't know
why I said those things.

749
00:52:30,175 --> 00:52:32,520
You were under an evil spell.
I'm not under it now.

750
00:52:32,555 --> 00:52:34,257
I'm glad.
Friends?

751
00:52:34,292 --> 00:52:35,960
Always friends.

752
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:42,125
I think we should start
the ices now.

753
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:45,280
If you agree, Mrs Patmore.
Certainly, Mrs Bird.

754
00:52:45,315 --> 00:52:47,365
Oh, my God.

755
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:51,000
Listen to that.
It's like the cry of the banshee.

756
00:52:51,035 --> 00:52:53,440
Mr Carson's telephone's ringing.

757
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:57,485
Isn't someone going to answer it?

758
00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:00,400
I wouldn't touch that thing
with a ten-foot pole.

759
00:53:00,435 --> 00:53:01,760
Well, I will, then.

760
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:11,320
No, Mr Carson's busy,
but can I take a message?

761
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:19,600
I've got news, milady.

762
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:29,645
Mr Bromidge has rung!

763
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:31,640
You've done it, Gwen!
You've got the job!

764
00:53:31,675 --> 00:53:34,200
Take it! Take it!

765
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:37,925
Something to celebrate?

766
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:41,400
I've got the job, Mrs Hughes!
I'm a secretary! I've begun!

767
00:53:41,435 --> 00:53:43,560
I'm very happy for you, Gwen,
and we'll celebrate

768
00:53:43,595 --> 00:53:45,240
after we've finished today's work.

769
00:53:45,275 --> 00:53:47,320
Of course, Mrs Hughes.

770
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:52,480
I don't suppose -
Lady Sybil...

771
00:53:52,515 --> 00:53:55,520
Her Ladyship was asking after you.

772
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:04,125
Be careful, my lad.

773
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:07,360
Or you'll end up with no job
and a broken heart.

774
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:10,840
What do you mean?

775
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:18,440
I don't seem to be able to find
your sister.

776
00:54:18,475 --> 00:54:20,365
I wonder where she is.

777
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,285
Of course
she may have been cornered.

778
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:25,720
I know there was some old bore
she was trying to dodge.

779
00:54:25,755 --> 00:54:27,965
Who is that?
I'm not sure.

780
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
He's simply ghastly, apparently.

781
00:54:30,035 --> 00:54:31,965
But he's promised to propose today.

782
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,360
I can't tell you how funny she was
when she acted it out.

783
00:54:34,395 --> 00:54:36,120
She ought to go on the stage.

784
00:54:36,155 --> 00:54:37,805
Really?

785
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:39,800
Ah. How amusing.

786
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:43,325
Well done, Mrs Hughes.

787
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:45,880
Beautifully executed as always.

788
00:54:45,915 --> 00:54:48,365
The key is in the planning.

789
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:50,365
Mr Carson, this isn't the moment,

790
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:53,440
but I've heard from Dr Clarkson I've
been accepted for a training scheme

791
00:54:53,475 --> 00:54:55,285
for the Army Medical Corps.

792
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:57,520
Have you, indeed?
Yes. And I want to do it.

793
00:54:57,555 --> 00:54:59,497
So I'll be handing in my notice.

794
00:54:59,532 --> 00:55:01,405
I'll serve out the month, of course.

795
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:03,840
Thank you, Thomas.
We can talk about it, later.

796
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:10,200
And you couldn't have planned
that any better either.

797
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:17,760
You can't be leaving yet!
I'm afraid I must.

798
00:55:17,795 --> 00:55:20,360
Please, make my excuses
to your mother.

799
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:59,840
I wish you'd come inside, milady.

800
00:55:59,875 --> 00:56:01,880
No.

801
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,200
People mustn't think I'm really ill.

802
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:11,240
I don't want to cast a dampener
on the party.

803
00:56:11,275 --> 00:56:13,125
Very well.

804
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:17,320
But are you sure you have
everything you need, milady?

805
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:22,600
Dear O'Brien.

806
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:27,320
How sweet you are.

807
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:36,360
O'Brien! O'Brien.

808
00:56:36,395 --> 00:56:38,765
Can I have a word?

809
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:41,920
I need a favour and I don't want
to bother Lady Grantham with it.

810
00:56:41,955 --> 00:56:45,177
Certainly, milady. She's been
helping me find a new maid

811
00:56:45,212 --> 00:56:48,400
and we've had quite a few answers
from her advertisement.

812
00:56:48,435 --> 00:56:50,245
Can you find where she's put them,

813
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:52,525
and get Branson to bring them
to the Dower House?

814
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:55,200
Her Ladyship was helping you find
a new lady's maid? Yes.

815
00:56:55,235 --> 00:56:57,805
We should have asked you, really.

816
00:56:57,840 --> 00:57:01,405
You might take a look at the letters
if you have a minute.

817
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:05,440
There was one we liked the sound
of who'd been trained in Paris.

818
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:08,760
Do you know
where she might have put them?

819
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:12,325
The answers?

820
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:16,120
Oh, yes, milady. There are only two
or three places they could be.

821
00:57:16,155 --> 00:57:18,285
Oh, thank you, O'Brien.

822
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:20,040
You're a treasure. Thank you.

823
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:28,600
I didn't know a garden party
was a spectator sport.

824
00:57:28,635 --> 00:57:30,725
Pretty, though, isn't it?

825
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:32,840
Hard to believe the clouds
are gathering

826
00:57:32,875 --> 00:57:34,965
on a summer's day like this.

827
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:40,200
Mr Bates, I know you think I was
wrong to call on your mother -

828
00:57:40,235 --> 00:57:42,765
I don't think that.

829
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:44,440
She likes you, by the way.

830
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:48,605
I had to find out the truth.

831
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:51,120
But, you see, you don't know
the whole truth, even now.

832
00:57:51,155 --> 00:57:52,880
You know my mother's truth.

833
00:57:52,915 --> 00:57:54,960
But not your wife's...

834
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:58,380
Where is she now?

835
00:57:58,415 --> 00:58:00,520
I couldn't tell you.

836
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:05,200
I'd better get back.

837
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,120
Are you here, Mr Molesley?
I didn't know that.

838
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:14,437
Just helping out.

839
00:58:14,472 --> 00:58:16,685
Nice girl, that Anna.

840
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:20,240
Do you know if she's got anyone
special in her life?

841
00:58:20,275 --> 00:58:22,125
I'd like to say she hasn't.

842
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:25,245
I would, truly.
But I'm afraid there is someone.

843
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:28,165
And do you think he's keen
on her? Or is it worth a go?

844
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:33,240
Well, he keeps himself to himself
and he's very hard to read at times.

845
00:58:33,275 --> 00:58:35,525
But I'd say he's keen.

846
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:37,600
I'd say he was very keen, indeed.

847
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:45,565
Daisy, I said ices, not iced cakes.

848
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:49,040
Now, unclog your ears and get Mr
William before they turn into soup.

849
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:56,205
But I don't understand. Nothing's
changed. Everything's changed.

850
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:59,320
You can't be sure I was going to
refuse you, even if it had been a boy

851
00:58:59,355 --> 00:59:01,725
because I'm not.
That's the point.

852
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:05,360
I can't be sure.
Of you or of anything, it seems.

853
00:59:05,395 --> 00:59:07,320
The last few weeks
have taught me that.

854
00:59:07,355 --> 00:59:09,520
But you can't leave Downton.

855
00:59:09,555 --> 00:59:11,885
I can't stay. Not now.

856
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:14,165
Well, what will you tell Papa?

857
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:16,480
That I'm grateful
for what he's trying to do.

858
00:59:16,515 --> 00:59:18,800
But the experiment is at en end.

859
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:23,640
I'm not a puppet and I must take
charge of my own life again.

860
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:28,480
Would you have stayed
if I'd accepted you?

861
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:32,160
Of course.

862
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:35,885
So I've ruined everything.

863
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:38,440
You've shown me I've been living
in a dream.

864
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:41,800
And it's time to to return
to real life.

865
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:45,525
Wish me luck with it, Mary.

866
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:47,720
God knows, I wish the best for you.

867
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:04,805
Well, Rosamund.

868
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:07,500
I'm afraid your meddling
has cost Mary

869
01:00:07,535 --> 01:00:10,125
the only decent offer
she'll ever get.

870
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:12,800
I'm sorry, Mama, but you know me,
I have to say what I think.

871
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:15,405
Why?

872
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:17,480
Nobody else does.

873
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:29,680
Are you quite well, milady?

874
01:00:29,715 --> 01:00:31,445
Of course!

875
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:33,280
You know me, Carson.

876
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:36,320
I'm never down for long.

877
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:45,720
I know you have spirit, milady.

878
01:00:45,755 --> 01:00:47,925
And that's what counts.

879
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:50,240
It's all that counts, in the end.

880
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:56,000
There, there.

881
01:00:57,680 --> 01:01:01,800
So Mary is to be denied her
Countess's coronet after all.

882
01:01:01,835 --> 01:01:04,120
Don't crow at me.
I think she was very foolish

883
01:01:04,155 --> 01:01:06,040
not to take him when she could.

884
01:01:06,075 --> 01:01:07,765
I told her so.

885
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:09,685
If I'm perfectly honest, I wonder

886
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:12,000
if Matthew isn't making the same
mistake right now.

887
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:20,725
Are you warm enough?

888
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:23,205
I am when you're holding my hand.

889
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:26,680
Your Lordship,
this has just arrived for you.

890
01:01:26,715 --> 01:01:28,165
Thank you.

891
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:32,120
I'm happy to tell you that Thomas
has just handed in his notice.

892
01:01:32,155 --> 01:01:35,000
So we'll be spared any unpleasantness
on that score.

893
01:01:35,035 --> 01:01:36,800
What a relief.

894
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:53,245
Please! Will you stop, please?

895
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:58,600
My lords, ladies and gentlemen,
can I ask for silence?

896
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:03,400
Because I very much regret
to announce...

897
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:07,640
..that we are at war with Germany.

898
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:34,520
