00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,479
Should we give them some more space
between the beds?

2
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,519
Well, we could give them...
Not much.

3
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,119
I'm determined to defend the library
as a recreation room.

4
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,879
Where are we to sit?
We can screen off the small library.

5
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,959
Is that all? I suppose...
Or we could leave you the boudoir.

6
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,439
I wanted to put the intermediaries
in there, but we don't have to.

7
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,960
How kind.

8
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:54,879
Why will we only have officers?
Surely all wounded men need
to convalesce.

9
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:59,599
The hospital is for officers.
The whole idea is to have
a complimentary convalescent home.

10
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,759
Of course. But I don't know if we
can make that an absolute rule.

11
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,639
If the world were logical, I would
rather agree with you.

12
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,440
Which comes as no surprise.

13
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,559
You would not, I imagine.

14
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,319
You imagine right.

15
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,440
What these men will need is rest
and relaxation.

16
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:19,160
Will that be achieved by mixing ranks
and putting everyone on edge?

17
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,879
Granny!

18
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,999
Different ranks can relax together.
It has been known.

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,719
Well, don't look at me.
I'm very good at mixing.

20
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,959
We always danced the first waltz
at the Servants' Ball, didn't we,
Carson?

21
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,240
It was an honour, my lady.
It's a lot to ask when people
aren't at their best.

22
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,400
I'm searching for Lady Mary, Carson.
Will you tell her I'm in the library?

23
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,319
Don't loiter, Edith.
There's plenty to be done.

24
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,038
Of course, but I'm not quite sure...

25
00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:51,800
Sybil I wanted to have a quick word.

26
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,479
I'm going down to the village this
afternoon if anyone wants anything.

27
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,519
Some stamps would be kind.
I'll get you the money.

28
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,559
I'd like to thank you all
for your work this morning.

29
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,959
It's so strange to see the rooms
converted into dormitories. But good.

30
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:13,199
It was wrong for our life to chug
along as if the war were only
happening to other people.

31
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,359
How will it be, though? Are we all
working for Mrs Crawley, now?

32
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,639
We are not.

33
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,799
I'm sure the chain of command will
be sorted out soon.

34
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,839
Or there'll be blood on the stairs.

35
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,760
Thank you, Miss O'Brien.

36
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,079
But what do you think it meant?

37
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,799
Really, Granny. Lavinia Swire knows
Richard Carlisle. So what?

38
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,839
One knows lots of people in London.

39
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,199
I don't know many people who'd
threaten me behind the laurels.

40
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,559
Aunt Rosamund said herself
she didn't know what to make of it.

41
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,199
I still think it's a peculiar way
for a gentleman to speak to a lady.

44
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,200
I'm not sure it matters much to me.

45
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,879
Well I'm going up to London to stay
with Rosamund for a day or two.

46
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,720
I think we'll have Lavinia for tea.

47
00:03:01,721 --> 00:03:04,199
You sound as if
you're going to gobble her up.

48
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,879
If only we could.

49
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,479
But where are they going to eat?

50
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,759
I understand from Mrs Crawley that
they'll share the dining room with
the officers who are almost well.

51
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,959
So, am I running a canteen now?

52
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:23,199
William says he's got time
off between the end of his training
and going overseas.

53
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,319
He'll be with his father, surely?

54
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:28,279
He's going home first, but wants
to come here for his last night.

55
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,479
You wouldn't mind that,
would you, Mr Carson? Certainly not.

56
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,759
I'd be glad to wish him well
on his way.

57
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,760
Oh, for you, Mr Branson.

58
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,079
Why do you think he's coming here?

59
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,839
To see us all and say goodbye.
What's wrong with that?

60
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,879
But suppose it's something more.

61
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,479
Suppose he's got plans.

62
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,439
Well, you have to deal with that
when it happens
and mind you deal fair.

63
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:56,040
Now go and grate that suet
before I grow old and die.

64
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,519
Who will be in charge?

65
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,559
Cousin Isobel thinks it'll be her.

66
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,479
All I know is that she'll drive us
mad before the end.

67
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:42,120
I'm going up to change.
I just want to finish this.

68
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,479
Aren't you going to the hospital?
Not yet.

69
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,280
I'm on a night shift.
I'll walk down after dinner.

70
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,480
And please don't start lecturing me.
I won't.

71
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,560
The truth is I envy you.

72
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,280
Do you ever miss helping out
on the Drakes' farm?

73
00:05:00,281 --> 00:05:02,319
That's a funny question.

74
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,359
Why?
No reason.

75
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,599
It's just you seemed to have
such a purpose there.

76
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,639
It suited you.

77
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,679
It did suit me.

78
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,159
I enjoyed it,
but now I feel like a spare part.

79
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,799
Trust me.

80
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,039
You have a talent
that none of the rest of us have.

81
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,040
Just find out what it is and use it.

82
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,600
It's doing nothing that's the enemy.

83
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:34,599
The truth is, my lady, Mrs Crawley
has forgotten this is your house

84
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,119
and we need a friend in charge of
the day-to-day management,

85
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,719
because if Mrs Crawley gets one of
her toadies in to run things,

86
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,479
she'll have her nose in every pie
before you can say Jack Robinson.

87
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,080
But who?

88
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,759
What about Thomas, my lady?

89
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:52,999
He's hospital trained and he's always
had a soft spot for Downton.

90
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,239
Thomas, the footman?

91
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,799
Managing Downton Abbey?

92
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,879
But he's not a footman, now, is he?

93
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:03,639
He's a corporal, with real battle
experience as a medic.

94
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,679
Could Dr Clarkson spare him?

95
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,879
Well...

96
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,160
I suppose he'll have to spare
somebody.

97
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,719
Are you all right?

98
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,720
You seem a bit preoccupied.

99
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,439
I had a...

100
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,479
No, never mind.

101
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,080
What?

102
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,960
It was this afternoon,
in the village.

103
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,359
I thought I saw Mr Bates.

104
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,879
Bates?

105
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,719
Isn't he in London?

106
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:42,639
I might have been wrong.
I walked over to where he was
standing. There was no sign of him.

107
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,679
Do you know his address in London?

108
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,719
As long as he's still there. Why?

109
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,919
I'll telephone Sir Richard
and ask him to look into it.

110
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,719
But what would he know?
He works in newspapers.

111
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,920
A world of spies, tip-offs
and private investigators.

112
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,800
I promise you, he can find out
whatever he likes.

113
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,159
All right, then.
If you think he can help.

114
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,679
Good.

115
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,480
I'll ring him tonight.

116
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,519
Not bad.
Try to fit in a bit of practice.

117
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:14,840
We've plenty of time
to get it right, before there's
anyone to see me who matters.

118
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,719
I only know Sir Richard
because he is or was

119
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,280
a friend of my father's
and of my uncle, Jonathan Swire.

120
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,520
The Liberal minister?
That's it.

121
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,639
But I'm afraid they've fallen out.

122
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,840
Oh.

123
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:40,919
This room is so pretty.
Has the house always been
the Painswicks' London home?

124
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,639
There's no 'always'
about the Painswicks, my dear.

125
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:47,279
They were invented from scratch
by my son-in-law's grandfather.

126
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,200
We bought the house
when we were married.

127
00:07:49,201 --> 00:07:53,039
You make Mr Painswick sound rather
a rough diamond, Lady Grantham.

128
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,759
Marmaduke wasn't a rough diamond,
was he, Mama?

129
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,960
No. He was just cut and polished
comparatively recently.

130
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,599
Carson's told Papa
you've been called up.

131
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,079
There's no need to look so serious.

132
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,639
You'd think me rather heartless
if I didn't.

133
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,679
I'm not going to fight.

134
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,680
You'll have to.
I will not.

135
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:20,159
I'm going to be a conscientious
objector. They'll put you in prison.

136
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,559
I'd rather prison
than the Dardanelles.

137
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,439
When will you tell them?

138
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,440
In my own good time.

139
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,600
I don't understand.

140
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,679
I'll go to the medical.
I'll report for duty.

141
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:38,039
When I'm on parade, I'll march out
front and I'll shout it,
loud and clear.

142
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:41,279
If that doesn't make the newspapers,
then I'm a monkey's uncle.

143
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,760
But you'll have a record
for the rest of your life.

144
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,320
At least I'll have a life.

145
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,600
I know the popular fantasy is
that we can feed six strong men...

146
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,439
from a single seed cake,
but you and I know better.

147
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,240
Have we got the flour for any more?
Go and check now.

148
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,199
Cheer up.

149
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,439
It's not as bad as that.

150
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,440
What's the matter, Mr Lang?

151
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,360
Tell me. I won't bite.

152
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:22,680
I sometimes feel I'm the only one
who knows what's going on over there.

153
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,079
You all wander round ironing clothes

154
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,999
and cleaning boots and choosing
what's for dinner,

155
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,239
while over the Channel,
men are killed

156
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,959
and maimed

157
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,999
and blown to pieces.

158
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,359
We know more than you think.
The war hasn't left us alone.

159
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,000
It hasn't left me alone,
however it may look.

160
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,079
Have you any idea...

161
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,080
how scared they are?

162
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,119
How scared they all are?

163
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,279
I lost my nephew.

164
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,319
My sister's boy.

165
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,320
He was shot.

166
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,600
For cowardice.

167
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,279
That's what they said.

168
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:09,440
But I knew him and he'd never
have done such a thing...

169
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:13,600
if he hadn't have been
half out of his mind with fear.

170
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,520
Don't blame him.

171
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,680
It was him,
but it could have been me.

172
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,120
It could have been any of us.

173
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,279
Suppose I don't want to come back?

174
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:34,000
To be in charge?
Telling Mr Carson what to do?

175
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,799
Why? What's in it for you?

176
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,559
All right. It's to stop Mrs Crawley
bossing her ladyship about.

177
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,599
She behaves as if she owns the place.

178
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,239
You've changed your tune.

179
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:49,399
When I were last here,
you'd have given money to see
her ladyship eat dirt.

180
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,400
Well, like you say,
I've changed my tune. People do.

181
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,439
Not without a reason.
I've got my reasons.

182
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:00,199
You've also got her ladyship
wrapped round your little finger.

183
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,960
Maybe. That's my business.

184
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,079
But I'll not hurt her and I'll not
let anyone else hurt her, neither.

185
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,080
That's all I've got to say.

186
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,360
You're a queer one and no mistake.

187
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,760
So will you come if I can fix it?

188
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,120
Why not?

189
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,440
I like the idea of giving orders
to old Carson.

190
00:11:32,739 --> 00:11:36,378
I go away for five minutes
and everything's settled.

191
00:11:36,379 --> 00:11:38,418
Nothing's settled.

192
00:11:38,419 --> 00:11:41,978
For a start,
which rooms will we live in?

193
00:11:41,979 --> 00:11:44,018
The small library and the boudoir.

194
00:11:44,019 --> 00:11:47,658
If Cousin Isobel can find somewhere
else for the intermediaries.

195
00:11:47,659 --> 00:11:51,138
There's always the boot room.
I'm sure you'll have use of that.

196
00:11:51,139 --> 00:11:52,858
And where are we supposed to eat?

197
00:11:52,859 --> 00:11:55,738
You can share the dining room
with those officers...

198
00:11:55,739 --> 00:11:58,538
No.
We all have to make sacrifices.

199
00:11:58,539 --> 00:12:00,258
No!

200
00:12:00,259 --> 00:12:04,178
Then we'll have tables set up
in the great hall for the mobile
officers and the nurses.

201
00:12:04,179 --> 00:12:07,538
And, Lady Grantham, I know you'll be
happy about one decision.

202
00:12:07,539 --> 00:12:12,779
Lady Grantham asked that the house
management might be put into
the hands of Corporal Barrow.

203
00:12:14,139 --> 00:12:16,098
Your former footman, Thomas.

204
00:12:16,099 --> 00:12:19,138
Thomas? In charge of Downton?

205
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:23,098
No, that's what I thought at first,
but he isn't a footman now,
he's a soldier.

206
00:12:23,099 --> 00:12:24,858
He's worked in medicine.

207
00:12:24,859 --> 00:12:28,578
Someone has to run the place who's
had medical training. But I feel...

208
00:12:28,579 --> 00:12:31,858
The men won't accept the authority
of a corporal. I've thought of that.

209
00:12:31,859 --> 00:12:35,938
I told my Commanding Officer that
Lady Grantham had asked for
Corporal Barrow.

210
00:12:35,939 --> 00:12:39,218
He's prepared to have him raised
to the rank of Acting Sergeant.

211
00:12:39,219 --> 00:12:40,939
But can you spare him?
We can.

212
00:12:41,659 --> 00:12:43,698
I've gone to some trouble to do so.

213
00:12:43,699 --> 00:12:48,738
Sergeant Barrow will manage
the daily running of Downton
and I shall be in overall charge.

214
00:12:48,739 --> 00:12:53,858
Aren't we missing a tier? There
should be someone here, permanently,
under you but over Thomas.

215
00:12:53,859 --> 00:12:56,658
That's correct and I will make
a decision before long.

216
00:12:56,659 --> 00:12:58,178
Until then,

217
00:12:58,179 --> 00:13:00,979
I do assure you,
Corporal Barrow is very efficient.

218
00:13:02,179 --> 00:13:03,818
I say good.

219
00:13:03,819 --> 00:13:07,058
If someone is to manage things,
let it be our creature.

220
00:13:07,059 --> 00:13:09,859
Why? Are you planning to divide
his loyalties?

221
00:13:11,179 --> 00:13:13,179
I wouldn't say I was planning it.

222
00:13:14,899 --> 00:13:17,938
William has asked to stay here,
my lord. Just for a night.

223
00:13:17,939 --> 00:13:19,978
On his way to active duty in France.

224
00:13:19,979 --> 00:13:22,018
Good. I should like to see him.

225
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:25,818
I don't suppose there's any way
we can keep him from harm?

226
00:13:25,819 --> 00:13:28,058
Him being an only child and all.

227
00:13:28,059 --> 00:13:30,298
We'd hate for anything to happen.

228
00:13:30,299 --> 00:13:32,699
Thank you, Lang. I can do the rest.

229
00:13:34,339 --> 00:13:36,139
Very sorry, my lord.

230
00:13:40,939 --> 00:13:45,578
To get back to the notion of Thomas
as the manager of Downton.

231
00:13:45,579 --> 00:13:47,618
He won't be a manager in that sense.

232
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:52,738
But her ladyship fixed it all with
Clarkson and she was so pleased
I didn't know what to say.

233
00:13:52,739 --> 00:13:55,738
'I cannot have him working here
because he is a thief'?

234
00:13:55,739 --> 00:13:58,338
You know she's ignorant of
Thomas's crimes.

235
00:13:58,339 --> 00:14:00,658
We agreed at the time
that would be best.

236
00:14:00,659 --> 00:14:02,218
And anyway...

237
00:14:02,219 --> 00:14:05,338
is it honourable in us to hold
Thomas's sins against him

238
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:08,498
when he has been wounded
in the service of the King?

239
00:14:08,499 --> 00:14:10,938
And who is to be in charge
over Thomas?

240
00:14:10,939 --> 00:14:12,938
You mean under Dr Clarkson?

241
00:14:12,939 --> 00:14:16,178
Well, we asked today,
but he hasn't decided.

242
00:14:16,179 --> 00:14:18,579
So we just make it up
as we go along?

243
00:14:19,939 --> 00:14:21,779
Unless you've got a better idea.

244
00:14:26,739 --> 00:14:30,378
Are you still here, Mr Branson?
Stay and have something to eat.

245
00:14:30,379 --> 00:14:34,298
Mr Branson's been telling us the
news from Russia. What news is that?

246
00:14:34,299 --> 00:14:38,018
Kerensky's been made Prime Minister,
but he won't go far enough for me.

247
00:14:38,019 --> 00:14:41,018
Lenin denounces the bourgeoisie
along with the Tsar.

248
00:14:41,019 --> 00:14:44,578
He wants a people's revolution and
that's what I'm waiting for.

249
00:14:44,579 --> 00:14:47,658
It won't be long, now.
And what's happened to the Tsar?

250
00:14:47,659 --> 00:14:50,978
Imprisoned. In the Alexander Palace.
With all his family.

251
00:14:50,979 --> 00:14:52,978
What a dreadful thing.

252
00:14:52,979 --> 00:14:55,538
They won't hurt them. Why would they?

253
00:14:55,539 --> 00:14:58,738
To make an example?
Give them some credit.

254
00:14:58,739 --> 00:15:02,018
This is a new dawn,
a new age of government.

255
00:15:02,019 --> 00:15:05,658
No-one wants to start it with the
murder of a bunch of young girls.

256
00:15:05,659 --> 00:15:10,098
You don't know that.
Nobody knows who'll get killed
when these things start.

257
00:15:10,099 --> 00:15:13,378
Look at her nephew.
Shot for cowardice.

258
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:16,738
Who'd have guessed that when he was
saying hello to the neighbours

259
00:15:16,739 --> 00:15:20,258
or kissing his mother good night?
Can you look at the crumble?

260
00:15:20,259 --> 00:15:23,978
I think it should come out, but it's
five minutes earlier than you said.

261
00:15:29,579 --> 00:15:31,818
I'm sorry. I never thought.

262
00:15:31,819 --> 00:15:33,858
Then you should think, Mr Lang.

263
00:15:33,859 --> 00:15:37,499
You're not the only member of
the walking wounded in this house.

264
00:16:02,019 --> 00:16:03,978
Why are you coming in this way?

265
00:16:03,979 --> 00:16:05,979
I'm the manager here now, Mr Carson.

266
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:08,458
Or had you forgotten?

267
00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:10,498
No. I had not forgotten.

268
00:16:10,499 --> 00:16:13,178
And will you be moving into
your old room?

269
00:16:13,179 --> 00:16:15,618
Or should we prepare
a guest bedroom?

270
00:16:15,619 --> 00:16:17,659
I'll sleep in my old room, thanks.

271
00:16:19,619 --> 00:16:21,258
So...

272
00:16:21,259 --> 00:16:23,498
Are we ready for the big invasion?

273
00:16:23,499 --> 00:16:25,618
Cos they'll be here at teatime.

274
00:16:25,619 --> 00:16:28,058
We'll have to be ready,
won't we, Thomas?

275
00:16:28,059 --> 00:16:30,098
We will, Mr Carson.

276
00:16:30,099 --> 00:16:32,338
And it's Sergeant Barrow, now.

277
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:34,659
'Acting Sergeant', I believe.

278
00:17:29,779 --> 00:17:31,818
How many are there altogether?
36.

279
00:17:31,819 --> 00:17:33,458
36. Right.

280
00:17:33,459 --> 00:17:35,659
Quick as you can, gentlemen.

281
00:17:39,339 --> 00:17:42,978
Driver, when you've finished
unloading here, go straight back.

282
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:45,018
This way please, gentlemen.

283
00:17:45,019 --> 00:17:47,019
Mustard gas...

284
00:17:52,779 --> 00:17:55,299
Don't worry.
We'll get you seen to quickly.

285
00:18:01,059 --> 00:18:05,098
Major Bryant, you're in the Armada
bedroom. Do you mind the stairs?

286
00:18:05,099 --> 00:18:07,139
It depends what I find at the top.

287
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:23,618
He's handsome.
Handsome and off-limits.

288
00:18:23,619 --> 00:18:26,738
It'll be nice to have the house
full of men. Full of officers.

289
00:18:26,739 --> 00:18:29,338
Officers aren't men.
Not where we're concerned.

290
00:18:29,339 --> 00:18:33,219
Oh, speak for yourself.
I speak for you, too, if you know
what's good for you.

291
00:18:36,619 --> 00:18:38,459
I'm very sorry, but I...

292
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:42,258
Matthew! What in the world
are you doing here?

293
00:18:42,259 --> 00:18:44,978
We start our tour of Yorkshire and
Lancashire tomorrow.

294
00:18:44,979 --> 00:18:48,378
General Strutt knew you lived up
here, so he's given me
a few hours off.

295
00:18:48,379 --> 00:18:51,218
What a lovely... lovely surprise.

296
00:18:51,219 --> 00:18:55,299
Mrs Crawley, how can we separate
the hospital's linen from our own?

297
00:18:56,379 --> 00:18:58,618
You go. We'll talk later.

298
00:18:58,619 --> 00:19:01,939
As soon as I've done this,
I'll take your orders for books.

299
00:19:08,779 --> 00:19:11,298
I hadn't cast you
as Florence Nightingale.

300
00:19:11,299 --> 00:19:14,138
We can't leave all the moral
high ground to Sybil.

301
00:19:14,139 --> 00:19:15,939
She might get lonely there.

302
00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:21,658
How are you? I know I mustn't ask
you what you're doing.

303
00:19:21,659 --> 00:19:23,698
You can ask what I'm doing in
Downton.

304
00:19:23,699 --> 00:19:28,298
We've finished in the Midlands.
Tomorrow, we start on the camps
in the northern counties.

305
00:19:28,299 --> 00:19:31,338
Will we see something of you?
My general ought to come here.

306
00:19:31,339 --> 00:19:34,978
It's exactly the sort of thing people
like to read about. Sybil, come.

307
00:19:34,979 --> 00:19:36,579
Edith can do that.

308
00:19:37,299 --> 00:19:39,978
Dear Mother.
She does love a bit of authority.

309
00:19:39,979 --> 00:19:42,418
I suppose she's driving
Cousin Cora mad.

310
00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:44,659
No names. No pack drill.

311
00:19:48,019 --> 00:19:50,219
Breathe in... and out.

312
00:19:53,379 --> 00:19:56,138
I'm surprised they didn't get
to you before now.

313
00:19:56,139 --> 00:19:58,178
Some people have all the luck, sir.

314
00:19:58,179 --> 00:20:00,219
You can get dressed.

315
00:20:01,779 --> 00:20:03,818
Shall I report for duty in Richmond?

316
00:20:03,819 --> 00:20:05,859
You'll be told what to do.

317
00:20:10,019 --> 00:20:14,178
But I must supervise
the medical staff. Overseen by me.

318
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:18,298
Carson, I'm relying on you to make
sure that that is so.
What is going on?

319
00:20:18,299 --> 00:20:20,538
I was arranging the household
duties,

320
00:20:20,539 --> 00:20:23,658
where they overlap with the duties
of the nursing staff.

321
00:20:23,659 --> 00:20:27,459
Shall we continue this upstairs?
Well, I've made up some charts...

322
00:20:29,859 --> 00:20:31,379
Of course.

323
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:39,818
Did you say you were the manager
or the referee?

324
00:20:39,819 --> 00:20:43,739
You see what we're up against.
Don't worry. We'll find a solution.

325
00:20:48,739 --> 00:20:53,618
You take over every room, you bark
at me like a sergeant major and you
give orders to my servants.

326
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:56,698
Cora, I'm sure - I'm sorry.
Are you in the middle of something?

327
00:20:56,699 --> 00:20:59,698
We're discussing the arrangements.
Oh, good.

328
00:20:59,699 --> 00:21:03,658
We've had a letter from
Evelyn Napier. He's in a hospital
in Middlesbrough.

329
00:21:03,659 --> 00:21:06,018
He's heard that we're
a convalescent home now

330
00:21:06,019 --> 00:21:08,978
and wonders if he can come here
once he's released.

331
00:21:08,979 --> 00:21:11,258
Of course he can come here.
Just a minute.

332
00:21:11,259 --> 00:21:16,698
The Middlesbrough General will have
their own arrangements for where
their patients convalesce.

333
00:21:16,699 --> 00:21:18,458
I'm afraid Mrs Crawley is right.

334
00:21:18,459 --> 00:21:22,498
Downton must function as part of
the official system or it cannot
function at all.

335
00:21:22,499 --> 00:21:25,258
Now I think perhaps I should make
one thing clear.

336
00:21:25,259 --> 00:21:30,378
Downton is our house and our home
and we will welcome in it any
friends or relations we choose.

337
00:21:30,379 --> 00:21:32,818
If you do not care
to accept that condition,

338
00:21:32,819 --> 00:21:36,178
then I suggest you give orders for
the nurses and patients and beds

339
00:21:36,179 --> 00:21:38,299
to be packed up
and shipped out, at once.

340
00:21:41,579 --> 00:21:45,379
Thank you, Lord Grantham,
for making your position so clear.

341
00:21:48,299 --> 00:21:50,538
Oh, just one more thing. The dog.

342
00:21:50,539 --> 00:21:54,738
What should we do to stop Isis
getting into the patients' rooms?

343
00:21:54,739 --> 00:21:56,378
I can answer that.

344
00:21:56,379 --> 00:21:58,138
Absolutely nothing.

345
00:21:58,139 --> 00:21:59,938
Ah.

346
00:22:29,859 --> 00:22:33,139
Anna, there you are. Ethel, could
you leave us for a moment?

347
00:22:38,619 --> 00:22:40,858
That was Sir Richard
on the telephone.

348
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:43,658
It might have been Bates
you saw in the village.

349
00:22:43,659 --> 00:22:45,298
Really?

350
00:22:45,299 --> 00:22:47,338
He's working up here at a pub.

351
00:22:47,339 --> 00:22:49,339
The Red Lion in Kirby Moorside.

352
00:22:50,659 --> 00:22:52,298
That's odd.

353
00:22:52,299 --> 00:22:54,138
Mr Bates in a pub?

354
00:22:54,139 --> 00:22:57,419
The question is what'll you do with
the information now you've got it?

355
00:23:02,739 --> 00:23:06,178
Could you just take this into
the hall for me? Yes, of course.

356
00:23:06,179 --> 00:23:09,379
Are you waiting for Papa?
Do you want me to go and find him?

357
00:23:10,459 --> 00:23:12,459
They turned me down.

358
00:23:13,539 --> 00:23:15,458
The army.

359
00:23:15,459 --> 00:23:17,218
Why?

360
00:23:17,219 --> 00:23:19,219
Apparently, I have a heart murmur.

361
00:23:20,299 --> 00:23:22,299
Or... to be more precise...

362
00:23:23,899 --> 00:23:27,739
'A mitral valve prolapse is causing
a pansystolic murmur.'

363
00:23:31,059 --> 00:23:33,818
I don't know what to say.
Is it dangerous?

364
00:23:33,819 --> 00:23:37,019
Only if you're planning to humiliate
the British Army.

365
00:23:38,139 --> 00:23:39,978
I suppose you're glad.

366
00:23:39,979 --> 00:23:43,698
You're not going to be killed
or go to prison. Of course I'm glad.

367
00:23:43,699 --> 00:23:47,578
Don't count your chickens.
If I don't get them one way,
I'll get them another.

368
00:23:47,579 --> 00:23:49,698
Why do you have to be so angry
all the time?

369
00:23:49,699 --> 00:23:52,738
I know we weren't exactly
at our best in Ireland.

370
00:23:52,739 --> 00:23:54,538
Not at your best?

371
00:23:54,539 --> 00:23:56,259
Not at your best?

372
00:23:58,659 --> 00:24:01,659
I lost a cousin,
in the Easter Rising, last year.

373
00:24:02,739 --> 00:24:05,058
You never said.
Well, I'm saying it now.

374
00:24:05,059 --> 00:24:07,258
He was walking down
North King Street, one day,

375
00:24:07,259 --> 00:24:10,098
and an English soldier saw him
and shot him dead.

376
00:24:10,099 --> 00:24:15,458
When they asked why he was killed,
the officer said because he was
'probably' a rebel.

377
00:24:15,459 --> 00:24:17,858
So don't say you were
not at your best.

378
00:24:17,859 --> 00:24:20,859
Sorry to keep you waiting, but we're
going to have to step on it.

379
00:24:44,459 --> 00:24:48,659
I'm not sure about Marryat.
Not to worry. I know we've got
lots of GA Henty.

380
00:24:49,739 --> 00:24:54,619
And I haven't forgotten about
your tobacco - just as soon as
I can get into the village.

381
00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:02,699
I think a bit of it
might have come loose.

382
00:25:04,979 --> 00:25:07,018
Is that better?
Much.

383
00:25:07,019 --> 00:25:09,738
But I may need some more tucking
very soon.

384
00:25:09,739 --> 00:25:11,978
Well, no-one tucks better than I do.

385
00:25:11,979 --> 00:25:13,618
Ethel.

386
00:25:13,619 --> 00:25:15,658
Go back inside, please.

387
00:25:15,659 --> 00:25:17,979
There are still more bedrooms
to be done.

388
00:25:30,699 --> 00:25:32,738
'Rosamund's going to find out.'

389
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:36,818
She knows some of those feeble-minded
idiots on the Liberal front bench.

390
00:25:36,819 --> 00:25:39,418
Poor Lavinia. I feel sorry for her.

391
00:25:39,419 --> 00:25:44,018
She's an obstacle to your happiness,
dear, and must be removed.

392
00:25:44,019 --> 00:25:46,738
When it's done,
you can feel as sorry as you wish.

393
00:25:46,739 --> 00:25:49,258
But even if Matthew does break it
off with her,

394
00:25:49,259 --> 00:25:51,138
why should he propose to me again?

395
00:25:51,139 --> 00:25:54,619
With your permission, dear, I will
take my fences one at a time.

396
00:25:59,579 --> 00:26:01,579
Any plans for your afternoon off?

397
00:26:04,499 --> 00:26:09,218
Major Bryant wants me to go to
the pictures in York with him,
when he's allowed out.

398
00:26:09,219 --> 00:26:11,219
But you'll say that's stupid.

399
00:26:12,579 --> 00:26:14,859
Not stupid. Insane.

400
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:17,738
Oh, he really likes me, though.

401
00:26:17,739 --> 00:26:20,538
He says he wants
to get to know me better.

402
00:26:20,539 --> 00:26:23,218
Has he told you how he's planning
to achieve it?

403
00:26:23,219 --> 00:26:24,819
Spoilsport.

404
00:26:26,739 --> 00:26:28,778
What are you up to?

405
00:26:28,779 --> 00:26:32,459
Just practising with these for
Lady Mary. I promised her I would.

406
00:27:15,579 --> 00:27:17,618
That's one and eight, altogether.

407
00:27:17,619 --> 00:27:19,619
Might I have a glass of cider?

408
00:27:23,539 --> 00:27:25,139
Thank you.

409
00:27:33,179 --> 00:27:36,059
I don't know if I've dreaded
this moment or longed for it.

410
00:27:38,459 --> 00:27:40,459
Well, either way, it's happened.

411
00:27:46,619 --> 00:27:49,138
I'm glad I'm in time
for tomorrow's state visit.

412
00:27:49,139 --> 00:27:53,298
I gather Lavinia will be there.
We must seize the opportunity
to challenge her.

413
00:27:53,299 --> 00:27:55,458
I don't really see on what basis.

414
00:27:55,459 --> 00:28:01,018
She stole secrets from her uncle,
Jonathan Swire, and gave them to
Carlisle to publish. Swire told me.

415
00:28:01,019 --> 00:28:03,978
The papers showed that half
the Cabinet were trying to get rich

416
00:28:03,979 --> 00:28:06,818
by buying shares before a government
contract was announced.

417
00:28:06,819 --> 00:28:11,258
Would you rather we were kept
in ignorance? It wasn't Lavinia's
business to make it public.

418
00:28:11,259 --> 00:28:14,298
Without her, the Marconi scandal
would never have happened.

419
00:28:14,299 --> 00:28:17,818
The politicians broke the law.
Lavinia did nothing wrong.

420
00:28:17,819 --> 00:28:22,538
She drags the Chancellor of
the Exchequer's honour through
the mud and you say it's nothing?

421
00:28:22,539 --> 00:28:24,178
It was only Lloyd George.

422
00:28:24,179 --> 00:28:27,898
But why did she betray her uncle
to Sir Richard in the first place?

423
00:28:27,899 --> 00:28:30,099
Because... they were lovers.

424
00:28:31,099 --> 00:28:32,738
Exactly.

425
00:28:32,739 --> 00:28:37,218
And now it is down to you to save
Matthew from the clutches of
a scheming harlot.

426
00:28:37,219 --> 00:28:40,378
Really, Rosamund.
There's no need to be so gleeful.

427
00:28:40,379 --> 00:28:44,578
You sound like Robespierre, lopping
off the head of Marie Antoinette.

428
00:28:48,619 --> 00:28:50,458
It was me.

429
00:28:50,459 --> 00:28:53,379
I knew you used to go into
the village on a Wednesday.

430
00:28:54,539 --> 00:28:56,539
I so longed for a glimpse of you.

431
00:28:58,019 --> 00:29:00,019
But why are you up here, at all?

432
00:29:00,819 --> 00:29:04,738
And why didn't you tell me? Because
I want to get things settled first.

433
00:29:04,739 --> 00:29:08,099
You see, I've discovered that Vera
has been unfaithful to me.

434
00:29:08,339 --> 00:29:09,939
I've got proof.

435
00:29:11,019 --> 00:29:13,058
We can't criticise her for that.

436
00:29:13,059 --> 00:29:15,178
No, but it means I can divorce her.

437
00:29:15,179 --> 00:29:19,138
I've had to leave the house to prove
that it has broken the marriage.

438
00:29:19,139 --> 00:29:21,378
So I came up here to be nearer you.

439
00:29:21,379 --> 00:29:24,059
But what if she fights it?
She can't.

440
00:29:25,139 --> 00:29:28,658
For her to divorce me, she needs
something beyond adultery.

441
00:29:28,659 --> 00:29:30,498
Cruelty or suchlike.

442
00:29:30,499 --> 00:29:32,538
For a husband, adultery is enough.

443
00:29:32,539 --> 00:29:34,578
That's not very fair to women.

444
00:29:34,579 --> 00:29:37,179
I don't care about fairness,
I care about you.

445
00:29:38,699 --> 00:29:41,018
The point is, I can get rid of her.

446
00:29:41,019 --> 00:29:44,658
If she goes quietly, I will give her
money and plenty of it.

447
00:29:44,659 --> 00:29:46,659
If not, she leaves empty-handed.

448
00:29:47,659 --> 00:29:51,459
And when will this be? I need to get
her to accept it, first.

449
00:29:53,299 --> 00:29:56,538
She's made threats
about selling stuff to the papers.

450
00:29:56,539 --> 00:29:58,338
What stuff?

451
00:29:58,339 --> 00:30:00,699
Don't worry.
They won't offer what I will.

452
00:30:03,139 --> 00:30:05,139
You've changed your hair.

453
00:30:06,219 --> 00:30:08,819
I was trying out Lady Mary's
new curling iron.

454
00:30:12,019 --> 00:30:13,979
What do you think?

455
00:30:15,659 --> 00:30:18,859
I think I would love you, however,
whatever, whenever.

456
00:30:22,019 --> 00:30:24,058
We don't have to wait, you know.

457
00:30:24,059 --> 00:30:27,818
If you want me to throw up
everything and come with you,
I will.

458
00:30:27,819 --> 00:30:29,458
Gladly.

459
00:30:29,459 --> 00:30:33,059
I can't marry you yet, not legally,
and I won't break the law.

460
00:30:34,419 --> 00:30:37,419
It's not against the law
to take a mistress, Mr Bates.

461
00:30:46,099 --> 00:30:50,299
I know you, Anna Smith,
and I love you and that is not
the right path for you.

462
00:30:51,579 --> 00:30:53,579
It won't be long, now.

463
00:31:06,179 --> 00:31:08,179
So, you're not going to war, then?

464
00:31:09,259 --> 00:31:11,059
Apparently not.

465
00:31:12,139 --> 00:31:15,458
Is it true about Mr Crawley bringing
a famous general here?

466
00:31:15,459 --> 00:31:17,298
Captain Crawley.

467
00:31:17,299 --> 00:31:18,899
But yes, why?

468
00:31:20,539 --> 00:31:22,139
No reason.

469
00:31:23,419 --> 00:31:28,578
If they arrive at five, we'll walk
him round the wards, then show him
the recovering men at play.

470
00:31:28,579 --> 00:31:32,218
After that, a fairly grand dinner.
I'll tell them to bring mess kit.

471
00:31:32,219 --> 00:31:33,818
That is my challenge, my lord.

472
00:31:33,819 --> 00:31:37,178
How to make the dinner sufficiently
grand with no footmen in the house.

473
00:31:37,179 --> 00:31:39,778
Plenty of people give dinners
without footmen.

474
00:31:39,779 --> 00:31:44,218
Not people who entertain Sir Herbert
Strutt, hero of the Somme.

475
00:31:44,219 --> 00:31:48,338
I'm sure he'll have seen worse
things at the front than a dinner
with no footmen.

476
00:31:48,339 --> 00:31:51,458
Carson only wants to show the general
proper respect.

477
00:31:51,459 --> 00:31:53,379
We will not criticise him for that.

478
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:55,298
Indeed we will not.

479
00:31:55,299 --> 00:31:59,058
I think Lord Grantham's plan is a
good one, with or without a footman.

480
00:31:59,059 --> 00:32:02,698
Matthew writes Miss Swire is coming
down from London for it.

481
00:32:02,699 --> 00:32:04,338
Really?

482
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:07,259
He never said so to me.
Does he need your permission?

483
00:32:09,939 --> 00:32:12,258
I think I should go round with him.

484
00:32:12,259 --> 00:32:15,138
You and Lady Grantham will both
come with us.

485
00:32:15,139 --> 00:32:17,538
But won't he want to talk about
the treatments?

486
00:32:17,539 --> 00:32:20,219
The treatments... and the house.

487
00:32:33,259 --> 00:32:34,859
Miss?

488
00:32:38,299 --> 00:32:40,338
It's Captain Smiley, isn't it?

489
00:32:40,339 --> 00:32:43,138
We haven't met yet,
but I'm Edith Crawley

490
00:32:43,139 --> 00:32:45,938
and tomorrow I can show you
where everything is.

491
00:32:45,939 --> 00:32:48,979
It's just that I'd like to write
a letter to my parents.

492
00:32:49,299 --> 00:32:53,298
Of course. There's paper and
envelopes in the library.

493
00:32:53,299 --> 00:32:55,338
No. You see, I've not written before.

494
00:32:55,339 --> 00:32:58,859
I didn't want to worry my mother
with the different handwriting.

495
00:33:05,939 --> 00:33:08,539
I'm left-handed. How's that for luck?

496
00:33:10,059 --> 00:33:13,418
I'm surprised your school didn't
force you to use the right.

497
00:33:13,419 --> 00:33:17,099
My mother wouldn't let them,
but now I wish they had.

498
00:33:18,379 --> 00:33:21,698
I've asked the others and they say
you're the one to help me.

499
00:33:21,699 --> 00:33:23,458
Of course I will.

500
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:25,218
I'd be happy to.

501
00:33:25,219 --> 00:33:27,219
That's what they said.

502
00:33:28,419 --> 00:33:30,258
If you can just...

503
00:33:30,259 --> 00:33:32,259
find a way to tell her.

504
00:33:33,659 --> 00:33:35,698
We'll both find a way.

505
00:33:35,699 --> 00:33:37,699
Together. I promise.

506
00:33:42,859 --> 00:33:44,898
Mr Carson, might I have a word?

507
00:33:44,899 --> 00:33:47,938
I'm busy with this dinner for
tomorrow night.

508
00:33:47,939 --> 00:33:52,578
Well, that's just it. I don't expect
you'll be using Mr Lang,
not after last time.

509
00:33:52,579 --> 00:33:54,418
I will not.

510
00:33:54,419 --> 00:33:56,778
So I wondered if I might be any help.

511
00:33:56,779 --> 00:33:59,498
I've waited at table before.
Do you mean it?

512
00:33:59,499 --> 00:34:02,498
I know I've no right
to ask it of a chauffeur.

513
00:34:02,499 --> 00:34:05,779
We have to keep up the honour of
Downton, don't we?

514
00:34:06,779 --> 00:34:10,978
I'm very grateful, Mr Branson. I'll
not hide it. Very grateful, indeed.

515
00:34:10,979 --> 00:34:13,058
You know where to find a livery?
I do.

516
00:34:13,059 --> 00:34:15,779
And I gather you won't be
leaving us, after all.

517
00:34:17,579 --> 00:34:19,659
Who knows what the future will bring?

518
00:34:22,979 --> 00:34:24,579
Aaa-aaargh!

519
00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:28,778
Aaaargh!

520
00:34:28,779 --> 00:34:30,818
Mrs Hughes? What is it?

521
00:34:30,819 --> 00:34:32,858
Who is that shouting?

522
00:34:32,859 --> 00:34:34,859
What's going on?
It's Mr Lang.

523
00:34:35,899 --> 00:34:37,899
What in heaven's name is happening?

524
00:34:38,979 --> 00:34:41,218
No! No, I can't do it!

525
00:34:41,219 --> 00:34:42,858
Mr Lang?
I can't do it!

526
00:34:42,859 --> 00:34:45,778
Wake up. You're having a bad dream.
You're having a dream.

527
00:34:45,779 --> 00:34:48,458
It's the soldiers, Mr Carson,
soldiers, but I can't.

528
00:34:48,459 --> 00:34:50,938
I can't go back,
no matter what they...

529
00:34:50,939 --> 00:34:53,138
No-one is asking you to go back,
Mr Lang.

530
00:34:53,139 --> 00:34:57,099
Just to put a sock in it.
Don't worry. You've had a bad dream.
That's all.

531
00:34:59,819 --> 00:35:01,819
Is it a dream?

532
00:35:03,539 --> 00:35:05,339
Thank God.

533
00:35:09,699 --> 00:35:11,699
Oh, thank God.

534
00:35:12,699 --> 00:35:15,899
Thank God. You're all right.
Let's get you back into bed.

535
00:35:16,979 --> 00:35:18,779
You're all right.

536
00:35:20,779 --> 00:35:22,779
I'm sorry.
It's all right, Mr Lang.

537
00:35:24,019 --> 00:35:26,019
I'm sorry.
You're all right.

538
00:35:27,099 --> 00:35:29,819
Is it any wonder,
when he's been to hell and back?

539
00:35:46,299 --> 00:35:47,899
Up.

540
00:35:49,819 --> 00:35:51,459
Up.

541
00:36:07,859 --> 00:36:10,858
My cousin, Lord Grantham.
Very kind of you, Lord Grantham.

542
00:36:10,859 --> 00:36:12,859
Welcome.
Lady Grantham.

543
00:36:13,699 --> 00:36:17,138
And this is Major Clarkson
who runs our hospital here.

544
00:36:17,139 --> 00:36:20,738
And I am Captain Crawley's mother
and will accompany you on your tour

545
00:36:20,739 --> 00:36:23,818
and explain the different levels of
care we practise here.

546
00:36:23,819 --> 00:36:27,698
Lady Grantham and Mrs Crawley will
both accompany us,
as we go round, sir.

547
00:36:27,699 --> 00:36:31,978
Makes a nice change
from the craggy-faced warriors
I'm usually surrounded by.

548
00:36:31,979 --> 00:36:34,738
I'd like to think that were true.
Please, come this way.

549
00:36:34,739 --> 00:36:37,538
There's a large recreational room.
I don't believe...

550
00:36:37,539 --> 00:36:40,898
Poor Mother. How she longs to hold
all the reins.

551
00:36:40,899 --> 00:36:42,499
Crawley!

552
00:36:43,819 --> 00:36:47,099
I should go, if only to keep
our respective mothers apart.

553
00:36:48,179 --> 00:36:51,738
I'm afraid Mrs Crawley is none too
pleased to play second fiddle, sir.

554
00:36:51,739 --> 00:36:53,738
Well, I hope she doesn't spoil
things.

555
00:36:53,739 --> 00:36:57,138
Well, that's just what I've been
meaning to talk to you about, sir.

556
00:36:57,139 --> 00:36:59,179
I'm trying to run a tight ship...

557
00:37:05,259 --> 00:37:07,298
What's the matter with your aunt?

558
00:37:07,299 --> 00:37:10,738
We should follow them in or Mama
will say we're unsupportive.

559
00:37:10,739 --> 00:37:12,739
Tell me what it is, please.

560
00:37:13,819 --> 00:37:15,459
All right.

561
00:37:16,419 --> 00:37:19,898
I know he's going to propose.
Well, then you're going to accept.

562
00:37:19,899 --> 00:37:23,058
Did you get that picture taken?
I did, yeah - Then fetch it.

563
00:37:23,059 --> 00:37:26,298
If you think I'm going to stand by
and watch that boy's dreams

564
00:37:26,299 --> 00:37:29,218
stamped in the dust, you've got
another think coming.

565
00:37:29,219 --> 00:37:32,778
You can take back your promise
when the war's over and not before.

566
00:37:32,779 --> 00:37:34,538
But it's a lie.

567
00:37:34,539 --> 00:37:37,498
Don't make him give up
when he's off to face the guns.

568
00:37:37,499 --> 00:37:40,179
You'd never forgive yourself
if owt happened.

569
00:37:42,539 --> 00:37:47,578
Do you remember when Aunt Rosamund
found you and Richard Carlisle
together in the garden?

570
00:37:47,579 --> 00:37:51,338
I knew I'd hear more about that.
She thought he was threatening you

571
00:37:51,339 --> 00:37:53,178
and now she's decided

572
00:37:53,179 --> 00:37:56,499
that you were behind
the Marconi share scandal in 1912.

573
00:37:57,579 --> 00:38:01,418
The Chancellor and other ministers
were involved, including your uncle.

574
00:38:01,419 --> 00:38:03,258
I remember the Marconi Scandal.

575
00:38:03,259 --> 00:38:05,498
No. Let's forget it. It's absurd.

576
00:38:05,499 --> 00:38:07,499
But Lady Rosamund is right.

577
00:38:08,699 --> 00:38:11,499
I did steal the evidence
for Sir Richard to print.

578
00:38:12,579 --> 00:38:14,379
I did start the scandal.

579
00:38:15,779 --> 00:38:18,618
The trouble is Aunt Rosamund can't
understand

580
00:38:18,619 --> 00:38:20,658
why you would do such a thing,

581
00:38:20,659 --> 00:38:22,698
unless you and Sir Richard were...

582
00:38:22,699 --> 00:38:25,299
- Were lovers.
- Mary, you must come.

583
00:38:29,659 --> 00:38:33,418
The ground floor rooms are for those
men who need the most care, sir.

584
00:38:33,419 --> 00:38:35,458
Yes, of course.

585
00:38:35,459 --> 00:38:37,498
General Strutt, sir.

586
00:38:37,499 --> 00:38:39,499
Oh, right, yes.

587
00:38:41,579 --> 00:38:44,258
Tell me about this officer.
Who is that man?

588
00:38:44,259 --> 00:38:48,698
I hope he's not complaining.
Oh, no. That's Captain Smiley.

589
00:38:48,699 --> 00:38:51,098
He hasn't an unkind bone
in his body.

590
00:38:51,099 --> 00:38:53,178
How do you know?

591
00:38:53,179 --> 00:38:56,738
Matthew, listen to this.
Everything all right, sir?

592
00:38:56,739 --> 00:38:59,418
What on earth is that about?
Oh, don't worry.

593
00:38:59,419 --> 00:39:04,218
Major Holmes can be a little
waspish, but he wouldn't want
to get us into trouble.

594
00:39:04,219 --> 00:39:06,739
How do you know so much
about a pack of strangers?

595
00:39:07,819 --> 00:39:09,819
They're not strangers to me.

596
00:39:11,179 --> 00:39:13,738
This is all very impressive,
Lady Grantham.

597
00:39:13,739 --> 00:39:17,058
The nurses and your own staff are
to be congratulated.

598
00:39:17,059 --> 00:39:19,099
I believe they are.

599
00:39:20,819 --> 00:39:22,819
I wouldn't say I was scared.

600
00:39:23,739 --> 00:39:25,739
I'm nervous, of course I am.

601
00:39:26,939 --> 00:39:28,978
But not scared.

602
00:39:28,979 --> 00:39:30,738
I think I'm ready.

603
00:39:30,739 --> 00:39:32,378
Don't mind me.

604
00:39:32,379 --> 00:39:35,379
Only I'm thinking of what
your dear mother would say.

605
00:39:36,699 --> 00:39:39,018
Well, I wish she was here
to see me off.

606
00:39:39,019 --> 00:39:41,219
Oh, she'd be so proud.

607
00:39:42,219 --> 00:39:44,939
Why, when we waved off our Archie,
I remember...

608
00:39:47,899 --> 00:39:50,138
What do you remember, Mrs Patmore?

609
00:39:50,139 --> 00:39:52,139
I'll tell you.

610
00:39:53,339 --> 00:39:57,258
You remember a fine young man,
who enlisted before he had to,

611
00:39:57,259 --> 00:39:59,618
and who gave his life
for his country,

612
00:39:59,619 --> 00:40:03,658
because he'd be alive and well today,
if he hadn't chosen to go to war.

613
00:40:03,659 --> 00:40:05,458
She's right.

614
00:40:05,459 --> 00:40:07,458
Happen she is.

615
00:40:07,459 --> 00:40:09,859
Come on, Daisy.
Back to the grindstone.

616
00:40:11,859 --> 00:40:14,338
What is it?
I just want a word with Daisy.

617
00:40:14,339 --> 00:40:16,379
I'm needed in the kitchen.

618
00:40:17,379 --> 00:40:19,379
There's plenty of time later on.

619
00:40:23,699 --> 00:40:25,779
Let's see what my aim is
like.

620
00:40:26,779 --> 00:40:28,138
And again.

621
00:40:28,139 --> 00:40:30,898
You must be enjoying your respite
from the front.

622
00:40:30,899 --> 00:40:32,538
Actually, I'm struggling a bit.

623
00:40:32,539 --> 00:40:36,698
I've just lost my soldier servant and
I haven't managed to replace him yet.

624
00:40:36,699 --> 00:40:38,938
So, when will you tell Matthew?

625
00:40:38,939 --> 00:40:40,978
Dinner is served, my lady.

626
00:40:40,979 --> 00:40:42,979
Don't waste the opportunity.

627
00:40:48,219 --> 00:40:51,138
Why must she be so savage?
It's my broken heart.

628
00:40:51,139 --> 00:40:54,658
It was her advice that wrecked it in
the first place. Classic Rosamund.

629
00:40:54,659 --> 00:40:58,219
She's never more righteous than
when she's in the wrong. Come on.

630
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:03,779
Everything all right, Mr Branson?
I think so, Mrs Hughes.

631
00:42:02,619 --> 00:42:05,658
Where's Mr Branson?
He's just taken up the soup. Why?

632
00:42:05,659 --> 00:42:07,378
Read that.

633
00:42:07,379 --> 00:42:11,298
'They'll have arrested me by now,
but I'm not sorry.'

634
00:42:11,299 --> 00:42:13,299
'The bastard had it coming to him.'

635
00:42:15,179 --> 00:42:16,779
Oh!

636
00:42:21,939 --> 00:42:24,139
What in God's name?
Read this.

637
00:42:28,059 --> 00:42:30,539
Where is he now?
Oh, my God.

638
00:42:36,939 --> 00:42:39,499
Thinking of renovating
the entire stable...

639
00:42:41,819 --> 00:42:43,939
I'm sorry to hear about
your servant.

640
00:42:45,899 --> 00:42:47,818
Pneumonia not a bullet.

641
00:42:47,819 --> 00:42:49,458
No!

642
00:42:49,459 --> 00:42:51,059
Yes.

643
00:42:51,979 --> 00:42:53,818
I don't envy you.

644
00:42:53,819 --> 00:42:56,019
A decent servant can change
your war.

645
00:43:08,619 --> 00:43:10,619
Get downstairs now!

646
00:43:16,019 --> 00:43:18,978
All right, all right!
There's no need to be so rough.

647
00:43:18,979 --> 00:43:23,178
There's every need to stop a murder!
Murder? What do you mean, 'murder'?

648
00:43:23,179 --> 00:43:27,139
You were going to assassinate
the general! Kill the general?
I was not.

649
00:43:28,139 --> 00:43:30,619
Eurgh! I was going to throw that lot
all over him.

650
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:35,298
What is it? Oil and ink and a bit of
a cowpat, all mixed with sour milk.

651
00:43:35,299 --> 00:43:38,418
He'd have needed a bath right enough,
but not a coffin.

652
00:43:38,419 --> 00:43:42,298
I thought you'd taken the soup up,
but you left it in the pantry.

653
00:43:42,299 --> 00:43:46,298
We'll use this. It's not been heated,
but the hell with that!

654
00:43:46,299 --> 00:43:48,538
We'll decide what happens to you
later!

655
00:43:48,539 --> 00:43:52,458
Never mind later, what about now?
How do we keep this dinner going?

656
00:43:52,459 --> 00:43:54,858
I'll serve, Mr Carson. I don't mind.

657
00:43:54,859 --> 00:43:57,459
And who knows when I'll have
the chance again.

658
00:44:00,459 --> 00:44:02,178
What was going on with the soup?

659
00:44:02,179 --> 00:44:05,018
It came. It went.
Nothing to worry about, my lord.

660
00:44:05,019 --> 00:44:09,458
Branson was taken ill, so William
volunteered to be footman,
one last time.

661
00:44:09,459 --> 00:44:12,898
You don't mind, do you? Oh, not
a bit. It's very kind of him.

662
00:44:12,899 --> 00:44:16,738
Our footman, William, is leaving us
tomorrow to join his regiment.

663
00:44:16,739 --> 00:44:21,338
That's why he's not in livery.
You're are a credit to this house
and this country.

664
00:44:21,339 --> 00:44:24,498
There is no livery so becoming
as a uniform.

665
00:44:24,499 --> 00:44:26,099
Sir.

666
00:44:27,419 --> 00:44:31,739
Lady Rosamund, Mary, all of you,
have been so kind to Lavinia.

667
00:44:32,819 --> 00:44:36,778
Well, naturally we're all curious
to know more of Miss Swire,

668
00:44:36,779 --> 00:44:39,139
if she is to reign over Downton
as queen.

669
00:44:40,579 --> 00:44:44,178
Dear me. I hope you haven't
unearthed anything too fearful.

670
00:44:44,179 --> 00:44:45,979
You must ask Mary.

671
00:44:48,379 --> 00:44:50,698
One thing I am still not
quite clear about.

672
00:44:50,699 --> 00:44:54,018
Who precisely is in charge of
Downton when you're not here?

673
00:44:54,019 --> 00:44:57,378
I've given it some thought, sir,
and it seems to be only fair

674
00:44:57,379 --> 00:44:59,418
that Mrs Crawley

675
00:44:59,419 --> 00:45:02,938
and Lady Grantham should share
that responsibility.

676
00:45:02,939 --> 00:45:04,978
Capital. Well said.

677
00:45:04,979 --> 00:45:09,338
The fact is I have been more than
gratified by my visit here today

678
00:45:09,339 --> 00:45:12,538
and I thank Captain Crawley
for arranging it.

679
00:45:12,539 --> 00:45:13,698
Hear, hear.

680
00:45:13,699 --> 00:45:17,898
You are all to be praised for your
response to our national crisis,

681
00:45:17,899 --> 00:45:20,899
but I've been talking
and I've been listening.

682
00:45:21,899 --> 00:45:23,938
I feel there is one among you

683
00:45:23,939 --> 00:45:27,139
whose generosity is in danger of
going unremarked.

684
00:45:28,419 --> 00:45:33,818
It seems the daily cares and needs
of the patients are being dealt
with, quietly and efficiently,

685
00:45:33,819 --> 00:45:35,458
by Lady Edith.

686
00:45:39,299 --> 00:45:41,778
Or that's what the officers tell me.

687
00:45:41,779 --> 00:45:44,258
So, let us raise our glasses

688
00:45:44,259 --> 00:45:46,059
and drink her health.

689
00:45:47,139 --> 00:45:49,418
- Edith. Darling.
- Lady Edith.

690
00:45:49,419 --> 00:45:51,019
Edith, dear.

691
00:45:54,659 --> 00:45:56,698
We were never lovers, not ever.

692
00:45:56,699 --> 00:45:58,738
You don't have to explain anything.

693
00:45:58,739 --> 00:46:00,739
Not to me.
But I want to.

694
00:46:01,939 --> 00:46:03,539
You see...

695
00:46:04,699 --> 00:46:07,538
My father owed Sir Richard Carlisle
a lot of money.

696
00:46:07,539 --> 00:46:09,339
Enough to bankrupt him.

697
00:46:10,979 --> 00:46:13,418
And Sir Richard offered
to waive the debt,

698
00:46:13,419 --> 00:46:16,458
if you gave him the evidence
of the ministers' guilt?

699
00:46:16,459 --> 00:46:18,298
Papa was terrified

700
00:46:18,299 --> 00:46:21,779
and I knew I could get into my
uncle's office and find the proof.

701
00:46:25,139 --> 00:46:26,739
What is it?

702
00:46:28,579 --> 00:46:32,259
He threatened to tell you all about
it and now I've told you anyway.

703
00:46:33,419 --> 00:46:35,258
My uncle was guilty.

704
00:46:35,259 --> 00:46:37,018
They all were.

705
00:46:37,019 --> 00:46:39,058
Sir Richard didn't make it up.

706
00:46:39,059 --> 00:46:40,898
I believe you.

707
00:46:40,899 --> 00:46:42,899
But that's not why I did it.

708
00:46:43,979 --> 00:46:46,299
It was entirely to save Papa
from ruin.

709
00:46:48,579 --> 00:46:51,779
I'll just go in and check
that everything is ready.

710
00:46:53,299 --> 00:46:55,338
Have you got that picture for me?

711
00:46:55,339 --> 00:46:57,139
I might have.

712
00:47:04,779 --> 00:47:06,298
Because...

713
00:47:06,299 --> 00:47:09,779
You know what I'm going to ask you,
so... will you?

714
00:47:11,259 --> 00:47:13,098
William, you're not sure.

715
00:47:13,099 --> 00:47:14,738
You can't be sure.

716
00:47:14,739 --> 00:47:16,058
I am sure.

717
00:47:16,059 --> 00:47:17,938
And so is she, aren't you, Daisy?

718
00:47:17,939 --> 00:47:21,098
Isn't this just what you told me
you hoped would happen?

719
00:47:21,099 --> 00:47:23,059
It's like a fairy story.

720
00:47:26,539 --> 00:47:28,578
Is she right, Daisy? Are...

721
00:47:28,579 --> 00:47:30,338
Are we engaged?

722
00:47:30,339 --> 00:47:32,178
Because if we are,

723
00:47:32,179 --> 00:47:34,539
I know I can tackle
whatever may come.

724
00:47:39,219 --> 00:47:40,819
Go on, then.

725
00:47:46,139 --> 00:47:47,339
William?

726
00:47:48,339 --> 00:47:50,498
Do you want to go up top?

727
00:47:50,499 --> 00:47:53,978
The general is leaving and Mr Carson
likes a full complement.

728
00:47:53,979 --> 00:47:55,818
No, Daisy. Not you.

729
00:47:55,819 --> 00:47:57,819
The war has not changed everything.

730
00:48:02,739 --> 00:48:06,938
The general is just about to leave.
I'm afraid he doesn't have time
to come in here.

731
00:48:06,939 --> 00:48:08,819
I hope it's all been a success.

732
00:48:10,659 --> 00:48:14,498
Cousin Violet said you had something
to say to me about Lavinia.

733
00:48:14,499 --> 00:48:16,139
What is it?

734
00:48:17,219 --> 00:48:19,738
I haven't the slightest idea.
Oh.

735
00:48:19,739 --> 00:48:23,539
What a relief. She was hinting you
had uncovered some horrid stain.

736
00:48:24,619 --> 00:48:28,338
The only evidence I've uncovered is
that she's a charming person.

737
00:48:28,339 --> 00:48:30,339
What a testimonial.

738
00:48:31,099 --> 00:48:35,259
The truth is we're very much alike,
so naturally I think she's perfect.

739
00:48:36,379 --> 00:48:38,218
We all do.

740
00:48:38,219 --> 00:48:40,258
Don't we, Aunt Rosamund?

741
00:48:40,259 --> 00:48:41,859
Quite perfect.

742
00:48:52,259 --> 00:48:56,218
Is there any chance you might take
our footman William,
for your servant?

743
00:48:56,219 --> 00:48:59,218
I can pull some strings, get him
transferred to your lot.

744
00:48:59,219 --> 00:49:02,498
If you'd like me to, of course, but
I can't promise to keep him safe.

745
00:49:02,499 --> 00:49:05,419
I know, but he'd have someone
looking out for him.

746
00:49:07,419 --> 00:49:09,178
Oh, my God.

747
00:49:09,179 --> 00:49:11,179
Lang, are you all right, old chap?

748
00:49:11,899 --> 00:49:13,538
Come, come, man.

749
00:49:13,539 --> 00:49:15,578
Things can't be as bad as all that.

750
00:49:15,579 --> 00:49:17,618
Carson?
Mr Lang, what's happened?

751
00:49:17,619 --> 00:49:19,258
Sir...

752
00:49:19,259 --> 00:49:21,459
The general and all these
officers...

753
00:49:23,339 --> 00:49:27,098
I don't have to go back with them,
do I? Because... I can't, sir. No.

754
00:49:27,099 --> 00:49:30,018
The general is looking for you,
my lord. Excuse me.

755
00:49:30,019 --> 00:49:32,058
It's been a great pleasure.

756
00:49:32,059 --> 00:49:35,179
If I don't see you again
before I have to go back, be safe.

757
00:49:36,579 --> 00:49:38,179
You, too.

758
00:49:42,419 --> 00:49:43,979
Come inside.

759
00:49:50,219 --> 00:49:51,819
Up!

760
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:11,598
Here. We've earned it.

761
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:13,199
Ah...

762
00:50:15,079 --> 00:50:17,398
So, what will you do with him?

763
00:50:17,399 --> 00:50:19,238
Branson or Lang?

764
00:50:19,239 --> 00:50:21,078
Not Mr Lang.

765
00:50:21,079 --> 00:50:23,718
He isn't well,
but he's not a bad man.

766
00:50:23,719 --> 00:50:26,959
No, not at all, but he doesn't
belong at Downton.

767
00:50:28,519 --> 00:50:30,558
I meant, Mr Branson.

768
00:50:30,559 --> 00:50:33,798
Hm, it's a delicate business,
Mrs Hughes.

769
00:50:33,799 --> 00:50:37,838
Would we really be right to tell
the police and cause a furore

770
00:50:37,839 --> 00:50:40,198
and bring a riot down on our heads?

771
00:50:40,199 --> 00:50:44,359
And all because he wanted to pour
a pot of slop over a man's head.

772
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:49,758
From your phrasing, I gather
the answer you want from me is no.

773
00:50:49,759 --> 00:50:51,798
Would it help, Mrs Hughes?

774
00:50:51,799 --> 00:50:54,599
That's all I'm asking.
Would it help?

775
00:50:55,919 --> 00:51:00,118
Where's Mr Branson? Mr Carson sent
him back to his cottage to stew in
his own juice.

776
00:51:00,119 --> 00:51:03,278
Will we see you in the morning,
William, to wish you luck?

777
00:51:03,279 --> 00:51:04,918
Oh, yes.

778
00:51:04,919 --> 00:51:09,559
But I've got something I'd like
to say now, if you don't mind.
Don't. Not yet.

779
00:51:10,919 --> 00:51:13,278
They must know sooner or later.

780
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:16,398
Daisy and I...
are going to be married.

781
00:51:16,399 --> 00:51:19,558
You never are! When?

782
00:51:19,559 --> 00:51:21,598
After the war.

783
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:23,599
I'm not sure I can wait that long.

784
00:51:36,479 --> 00:51:41,238
I see what I had planned to say is
already superfluous, Mr Lang.

785
00:51:41,239 --> 00:51:43,239
You got there before me.

786
00:51:44,759 --> 00:51:47,998
I've let you down, Mr Carson,
for that, I'm sorry.

787
00:51:47,999 --> 00:51:50,038
We let you down.

788
00:51:50,039 --> 00:51:53,359
You weren't suited for work
and I should have spotted that.

789
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:57,559
You'll have two months' wages and
please tell us how you get on.

790
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:00,998
And, when you're ready for work
again,

791
00:52:00,999 --> 00:52:03,358
you may rely on
a good report from me.

792
00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:04,959
That's kind.

793
00:52:05,959 --> 00:52:07,559
Thank you.

794
00:52:16,039 --> 00:52:19,678
It was nice of William to serve
tonight. He didn't have to.

795
00:52:19,679 --> 00:52:22,678
I'm going to arrange for him
to be Matthew's servant.

796
00:52:22,679 --> 00:52:25,238
With any luck,
it'll keep him out of trouble.

797
00:52:25,239 --> 00:52:29,838
Matthew and Mary looked so natural
together. Did you notice?

798
00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:31,839
Talking and laughing.

799
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:36,638
But I suppose Lavinia is a nice girl.

800
00:52:36,639 --> 00:52:39,439
We've dreamed a dream, my dear,
but now it's over.

801
00:52:40,719 --> 00:52:42,958
The world was in a dream
before the war,

802
00:52:42,959 --> 00:52:45,439
but now it's woken up
and said goodbye to it.

803
00:52:46,519 --> 00:52:48,559
And so must we.

804
00:52:59,879 --> 00:53:02,238
I'll stay until you want
to run away with me.

805
00:53:02,239 --> 00:53:04,439
Am I to see if Sir Richard Carlisle
has a brother?

806
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:07,878
One who's even richer than he is?
What's the matter with you?

807
00:53:07,879 --> 00:53:10,318
I'm on your side.
Then be on my side.

808
00:53:10,319 --> 00:53:14,558
If I am not appreciated here,
I will seek some other place
where I will make a difference.

809
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:16,198
Good.

810
00:53:16,199 --> 00:53:19,518
I am a woman, Mary,
I can be as contrary as I choose.

811
00:53:19,519 --> 00:53:22,998
Watch yourself, Mr Bates.
Thomas is in charge now.

812
00:53:22,999 --> 00:53:25,039
We don't need anyone with us.

813
00:53:27,279 --> 00:53:29,159
Matthew's missing.

814
00:53:29,184 --> 00:53:34,484
