00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,160
We can put the presents
in the drawing room

3
00:00:41,161 --> 00:00:43,680
against the window.
Very good, m'lady.

4
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,340
I suppose we do have to
display all the presents.

5
00:00:46,341 --> 00:00:48,960
It can look rather greedy.

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,560
I can't bear the disruption we've
brought on your heads. Don't be silly.

7
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,480
How are you feeling? I just wish I could
get rid of this damn stick. Sorry.

8
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,100
Don't be. If anyone has a
right to swear, it's you.

9
00:01:04,101 --> 00:01:06,680
Don't bully yourself.

10
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,880
Think of where we were a few months
ago and smile. I quite agree.

11
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,760
I want to make it up and down that
aisle without assistance. Up, yes.

12
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,240
You'll have me to lean on coming
down.

13
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,680
You still have three full days
of practise so never say die.

14
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,560
My goodness, is that the time?

15
00:01:24,561 --> 00:01:27,400
I must be getting back.
I'll go with you.

16
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:31,400
She's just sucking up, Mother.
Any bride who doesn't suck up

17
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,920
to her husband's mother is a fool.
(SNIGGERS)

18
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,040
Can I bother you?

19
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:47,520
Mrs Bryant has written a letter
I did not expect.

20
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:51,280
She says her husband wants to see
the baby. They both do.

21
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,680
Isn't that what you hoped?
Yes and no.

22
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,700
Remember what he was like last time?
I don't want to

23
00:01:57,701 --> 00:02:00,680
build up Ethel's hopes again.
Ethel's not important.

24
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:05,080
It's the boy's chances you have to
look to. I believe you're right,

25
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:08,000
though we come at it by different
routes.

26
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:11,300
Why announce it tonight,
all of a sudden?

27
00:02:11,301 --> 00:02:13,560
He's got a job at a newspaper.

28
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,400
He heard today, it's a real chance.

29
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:20,800
Let him go to Dublin then you can
use the calm to consider. (SIGHS)

30
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,640
Mary doesn't want you
to be trapped before

31
00:02:23,641 --> 00:02:26,440
you're completely sure.
But I am sure!

32
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,520
How many times do I have to say it?!
Anna, tell them!

33
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,560
Lady Mary's right.

34
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,080
It's a big thing, to give up
your whole world. Thank you.

35
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,200
Listen to her if you won't listen
to me. I'm not giving up my world!

36
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,220
If they give me up,
that's their affair!

37
00:02:44,221 --> 00:02:47,200
I'm perfectly happy to carry on
being friends with everyone.

38
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,480
Married to the chauffer?
Yes.

39
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:55,640
Anyway, he's a journalist now,
which sounds better for granny.

40
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,240
We're going to tell papa tonight.

41
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,480
We? You mean, you and Branson?

44
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:15,160
Downton is not a hostel.
No, Mr Carson.

45
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,600
You made such a point
of not being a servant

46
00:03:17,601 --> 00:03:20,000
any more, our ears
are ringing with it.

47
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,960
Trouble is, I'm a little out
of pocket at the moment.

48
00:03:22,961 --> 00:03:25,880
I cannot say that
I'm sympathetic

49
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,760
when you dabble in the black market.

50
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,240
I just need some more time,
Mr Carson.

51
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:38,440
How long is it since the last
patient left, Sergeant?

52
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:44,160
You're trespassing on our generosity.
I'll try to make myself useful.

53
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,640
Just find somewhere to go.

54
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,480
Yes?

55
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,200
I'm here.
So I can see.

56
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,860
It's not such a good idea.
We mustn't worry granny.

57
00:04:09,861 --> 00:04:12,600
You asked me to
come and I've come.

58
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,580
Would someone please tell
me what is going on or

59
00:04:15,581 --> 00:04:18,520
have we all stepped through
the looking glass?

60
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,680
Your grandmother has as much right
to know as anybody else.

61
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,880
Why don't I find that reassuring?

62
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:28,920
Oh, how much longer is Mr Carson
going to be? It's never worth

63
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,680
trying to make food interesting
in the servants hall.

64
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,760
You're very quiet this evening.

65
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,460
I've had a letter off Mr
Mason, William's dad.

66
00:04:37,461 --> 00:04:40,120
Oh, yes. What does he want?

67
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:45,600
To see me. You're his daughter-in-law,
why shouldn't he see you?

68
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:50,520
I wish it were as simple. I think
it is but I'll not reopen the wound.

69
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,680
'What do you mean, you knew?'
I hoped it would blow over.

70
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,480
I didn't want to split
the family when Sybil

71
00:04:57,481 --> 00:05:00,240
might still wake up.
You've driven me about,

72
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,160
bowing and scraping and seducing
my daughter behind my back?!

73
00:05:03,161 --> 00:05:06,040
I don't bow and scrape and
I've not seduced her.

74
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,620
Give your daughter some credit
for knowing her own mind.

75
00:05:08,621 --> 00:05:11,160
How dare you use that tone!

76
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,560
You will leave at once!
Oh, Papa! This is a folly!

77
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:19,320
A ridiculous, juvenile madness!
Sybil, what do you have in mind?

78
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,400
Mama, this is hardly ... No,
she must have something in mind.

79
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,920
Otherwise she wouldn't have summoned
him here tonight.

80
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,960
Thank you, Granny.
Yes, we do have a plan.

81
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,200
Tom's got a job on a paper.
Oh!

82
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,960
I'll stay for the wedding.
I don't want to steal their thunder.

83
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,040
But after that, I'll go to Dublin.

84
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,040
To live with him? Unmarried?

85
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,480
I'll live with his mother
while the banns are read.

86
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,480
And then we'll be married.

87
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,280
And I'll get a job as a nurse.

88
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,960
What does your mother make of this?

89
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,760
If you must know, she
thinks we're very foolish.

90
00:05:57,761 --> 00:06:00,520
So, at least we have
something in common.

91
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,160
I won't allow it! I will not allow
my daughter to throw away her life!

92
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,520
You can posture all you
like, Papa, it won't

93
00:06:07,521 --> 00:06:09,840
make any difference.
Yes, it will! How?

94
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:13,640
I don't want any money! You can
hardly lock me up until I die!

95
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,160
I'll say goodnight.

96
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,080
But I can promise you one thing.

97
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,200
Tomorrow morning, nothing will have
changed.

98
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,720
Tom.

99
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:41,020
He's not coming here!

100
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:43,900
I don't want him to see this place.

101
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:46,900
I won't have him pity me.
The question is are

102
00:06:46,901 --> 00:06:49,860
you prepared to let them
in to Charlie's life?

103
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:55,340
I suppose so, yes.
Good.

104
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:59,320
I'll ask them to Downton
for Monday at four

105
00:06:59,321 --> 00:07:02,300
and this time, it'll
be all above board.

106
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:08,620
Can't expect to live here free forever.
I didn't expect to get booted out.

107
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:11,420
You'll have to find some work.

108
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:16,180
It's not that easy. Every Tom, Dick and
Harry's looking for work these days.

109
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:20,620
And they all don't have a hand
like a Jules Verne experiment.

110
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:25,340
Mr Branson. I know it wasn't easy
last night.

111
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:30,300
You should have spoken out long ago.
Spoken out about what?

112
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:33,060
Oh, why not?

113
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:36,580
Lady Sybil and I are getting
married.

114
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,660
Have you no shame?!

115
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:46,100
I'm sorry you feel like that,
Mr Carson. You're a good man.

116
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:49,300
But, no, I have no shame.

117
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:52,200
In fact, I have great
pride in the love of that

118
00:07:52,201 --> 00:07:55,060
young woman and I will
strive to be worthy of it.

119
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:59,100
I will not disgrace myself by
discussing it, nor will anyone else.

120
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:03,100
Now, if you will go, Mr Branson,
we will continue with our day.

121
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:07,580
Leave an address where we will forward
what is owing to you. No problem.

122
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:13,020
I'll be at the Grantham Arms until Lady
Sybil is ready to make her departure.

123
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:15,540
I bid you all a good day.

124
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:21,300
Is it really true?
Please! I have asked for silence.

125
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:24,660
And silence I will have.

126
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:34,100
What on Earth is it? A gramophone.
Some cousins of mine have given it.

should stand well clear

I've left space at
the front for Jules.

131
00:08:45,421 --> 00:08:47,860
I know Lavinia's getting
something from papa.

132
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:52,220
And from me. As she's so slight,
a real necklace would flatten her.

133
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:57,500
What news of Sybil?
Papa is with her now.

134
00:08:57,501 --> 00:09:00,260
I'm afraid it'll end in tears.

135
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:03,420
Maybe, but they won't be Sybil's.

136
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:07,860
I used to think that Mary's beau
was a Leonce but compared to this,

137
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:10,420
he's practically a Hapsburg.

138
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,860
Don't worry. Your turn will come.

139

Will it? Or am I just to be

Isn't this what they do? Arrange
presents for their pretty relations?

Don't be defeatist, dear,
it's very middle class.

142
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:31,260
I'd better go up and support your
father.

143
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:34,200
Your threats are
hollow, don't you see?

144
00:09:34,201 --> 00:09:37,100
I won't be received in London?
I won't be welcome at court?

I do hope I'm interrupting
something.

00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:50,380
I only wish you were. I seem to be
getting nowhere. Have you seen Cora?

She's lying down.

And can we blame her?

all very well in novels, but in reality,

it can prove very uncomfortable

153
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:07,900
and while I am sure Branson
has many virtues...

154
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:11,780
No, no, he's a good driver.
I will not give him up!

155
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:16,300
Don't be rude to your grandmother.
No, she's not being rude. Just wrong.

156
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:18,620
This is my offer.

157
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:22,420
I will stay one week to avoid
the impression I've run away

158
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:25,020
and because I don't want to
spoil Matthew's wedding.

159
00:10:25,021 --> 00:10:27,580
Then we will marry in Dublin

160
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:31,180
and whoever wishes to visit
is welcome. Out of the question!

161
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:33,820
Will you forbid Mary and Edith?
No, no.

162
00:10:33,821 --> 00:10:36,420
Don't say anything you
may have to retract.

163
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:40,180
Know this. There will be no more
money.

164
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:44,100
From here on in, your life
will be very different. Well...

165
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:46,580
Bully for that.

166
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:52,300
I thought this might tide
you over... (GROANS)

167
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:55,180
Whatever's the matter?
I'm sure I'll be all

168
00:10:55,181 --> 00:10:58,020
right if I can just stay
still for a moment.

169
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:00,880
You will not stay still.
Not down here.

170
00:11:00,881 --> 00:11:03,700
Get to bed this minute.
I'll send for the doctor.

171
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:07,420
I can't. We've got the Crawleys
tonight and Miss Swire.

172
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:11,220
What with this business of Lady
Sybil. I'll deal with it.

173
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:18,020
Look, get Mr Mosley to help.
There's no need. I mean it!

174
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:22,060
The war is no longer an excuse for
sloppy presentation. Oh, very well,

175
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:26,340
I'll ask him, but only on condition
you go to bed. (GROANS AND COUGHS)

176
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:33,740
Are you too hot in that, m'lady?
You still have time to change.

177
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,780
No. Thank you.

178
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:45,420
So, what do we do next?
God knows!

179
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:48,540
This is what comes of spoiling her.

180
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:51,400
The mad clothes, the nursing.

181
00:11:51,401 --> 00:11:54,220
What were we thinking of?
That's not fair.

182
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:56,660
She's a wonderful nurse
who's worked very hard.

183
00:11:56,661 --> 00:11:59,060
And she's forgotten who she is!

184
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:04,140
Has she, Robert? Or have we
overlooked who she really is?

185
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:08,940
If you're turning American on me,
I'll go downstairs.

186
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:13,520
Mr Carson likes to serve
two white wines which

187
00:12:13,521 --> 00:12:16,220
you should open and decant
just before they eat.

188
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:19,700
A light one for the hors d'oeuvres,
a heavy one with the soup.

189
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:25,020
Keep that going for the fish then change
to claret which you need to decant now.

190
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:28,540
There's a pudding wine and,
after that, whatever they want in

191
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:32,060
the drawing room with their coffee.
It's a wonder they make it upstairs.

192
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,500
They don't drink
much of any of it.

193
00:12:34,501 --> 00:12:36,900
Let me show you the decanters.
These four...

194
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:39,300
So, I don't have to receive
that terrible man again.

195
00:12:39,301 --> 00:12:41,660
It won't be necessary.

196
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:45,820
They'll meet her in here but...
Should you be downstairs, m'lady?

197
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:48,660
Oh, I'm perfectly all right,
thank you.

198
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:52,020
Why Mosley? I could have done it.

199
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:55,020
But you always make a mountain
out of not being a servant.

200
00:12:55,021 --> 00:12:57,980
I'm just trying to be helpful.

201
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:01,980
I'm afraid, "being helpful", is not
something we associate you with.

202
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:08,580
Ooh, it's wonderful what fear
can do to the human spirit.

203
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:11,060
You quite right, Mr Mosley?

204
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:14,660
Yes, I just want to be absolutely
sure

205
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,500
that this is the lighter wine.

206
00:13:17,501 --> 00:13:20,300
What does it matter as
long as it's white? No.

207
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:23,940
I believe in starting the way
you mean to go on.

208
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:30,540
Don't want to get off on the wrong
foot.

209
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,740
I'm glad you're here, Sybil.

210
00:13:32,741 --> 00:13:34,900
I was afraid you'd have
a tray in your room.

211
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:37,900
Maybe you should have done.
Why?

212
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:40,880
I'm not eloping like a
thief in the night.

213
00:13:40,881 --> 00:13:43,820
I might have once but Mary and
Edith talked me out of it. Oh!

214
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:46,620
The plot thickens.

215
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:50,020
After all, Sybil's had time
to think about it. Mother!

216
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:52,580
It is not for us to have an opinion.

217
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,620
(CLATTERS GLASS)

218
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:57,220
Mr Mosley, are you quite well?
(PANTS)

219
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:00,900
I'm all right, thank you, sir.
I don't believe you are.

220
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:05,060
The awful truth is, I'm not quite
all right. I'm afraid I'm going

221
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:08,940
to ask you to excuse me.
I'm so sorry.

222
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:13,660
Would you like us to call
Dr Clarkson? No, it's too late.

223
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,940
He's coming for Mr
Carson, Your Lordship.

224
00:14:15,941 --> 00:14:18,180
I'll bring him up
when he arrives.

225
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:20,660
I can sleep in my dressing room.

226
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:25,140
Oh, I'm glad I've got you.
What you serving?

227
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:29,020
They're on the main course
so I can spare a moment?

228
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:32,100
I've been thinking and, erm, ...

229
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:35,780
I have to say something
that you won't agree with.

230
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,740
We're going to get married.

231
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:42,820
We can't. Not now.
You're not listening.

232
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:45,900
Go to Ripon tomorrow and take out
a special license,

233
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:49,300
I don't care how much it costs,
and fix the day.

234
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:53,380
We'll tell no-one, but this,
you will do. I can't.

235
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:56,460
Aren't I as strong as Lady Sybil?
I don't doubt that.

236
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:00,780
Well, then, if she can do it,
so can we.

237
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:03,220
That's what I've been thinking.

238
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:06,580
I have stuck by you, through thick
and thin.

239
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:09,060
Thin and thin, more like.

240
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:13,380
Mr Bates, if we have to face this,
then we will face it

241
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:17,380
as husband and wife and will not be
moved to the sidelines

242
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:21,700
to watch from a distance, with no
right even to be kept informed.

243
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:24,300
I will be your next of kin.

244
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:28,980
And you can't deny me that.

248
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:43,820
Haven't you taken it in yet?
Oh, I'm not well. I'm not well, at all.

First, Mr Carson then her ladyship
and now him.

250
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:49,720
Help him down to
the servants hall.

The doctor can look at him,
too, when he gets here.

Spanish flu has found it's way
to Yorkshire. And to Downton.

Dr Clarkson says
he's got ten cases.

Ah, I thought Mosley had
joined the Temperance League.

255

I'm afraid he's been taken ill, My Lord.
I'm sorry. Mosley, too? Good heavens.

256
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:12,180
Everyone's falling like ninepins.

00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,540
Lavinia?

258
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:17,700
Do you know, I'm not at all well,
either.

259
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:21,700
I wonder if I could lie down for a
minute? Of course. Come to my room.

260
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:25,940
They'll have lit the fire by now.
Excuse me.

261
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:38,900
Do you think we should take her
home? No, let her rest for a moment.

262
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:41,860
Well, I think I should go and help.

263
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:47,180
Wasn't there a masked ball in Paris
when cholera broke out?

264
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:52,580
Half the guests were dead before they
left the ballroom. Thank you, Mama.

265
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:55,380
That's cheered us up no end.

266
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:09,980
I'll take you to Mr Carson now and then
to see Mr Mosley in the servant's hall.

267
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:13,020
Dr Clarkson, you're kind to come.
How is she?

268
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:16,580
Not too bad but she'll need some
nursing for a day or two.

269
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:19,360
Don't worry about that, all our
daughters are professionals.

270
00:17:19,361 --> 00:17:22,100
Let's leave her
to get some rest.

Miss Swire may be
another victim.

272
00:17:24,301 --> 00:17:26,460
She's sleeping now, I don't
want to disturb her.

273
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,000
When she wakes give her
some aspirin, cinnamon and

274
00:17:29,001 --> 00:17:31,500
milk and keep her here.
I'll look at her tomorrow.

275
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:36,100
We better go to Carson.
I'll come, too.

Actually, I rather like it.

00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:01,380
Of course not.

302
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:04,260
However much I might want to.

303
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,700
Absolutely not.

304
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,500
Hello?

305
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,380
What are you doing up?

306
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:30,500
Shouldn't we be getting back.
It's decided.

307
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:32,540
You're staying here.

308
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:36,660
Dr Clarkson's coming in the morning
so he can treat you all together.

309
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:41,140
You can borrow some things until
Matthew brings you what you need.

310
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:44,140
I'll go and organise a room.

311
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:53,380
How do you feel?

312
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:57,300
Like a nuisance.
You could never be that.

313
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:04,020
I mean it, Matthew.
Don't ever let me be a nuisance.

314
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:09,940
Don't ever let me get in the way,
please. (RECORD ENDS)

315
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:16,180
I'll sleep on a chair in her room.
There's no need for that. I don't mind.

316
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:20,260
I'd like to be on hand.
So, we're quite the hospital again.

317
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:23,980
You'll probably gain more patients
over the next few da...

318
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:26,020
(SNIFFS)

319
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:31,420
You don't need to worry about
Mosley. He'll be fine in the morning.

320
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:33,740
Oh?
Ah-hah.

321
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:37,980
The others have Spanish flu.
He's just drunk.

322
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:50,060
Oh, did you want Mr Bates, My Lord?

323
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:53,700
Oh, I forgot to say I want to be
woken early. I can tell him that.

324
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:58,540
Freddie got into Ripon Grammar,
so whatever you said, it worked.

325
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:01,740
Marvellous, some good news at last.

326
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:08,620
I hate to hear you talk like that.
I'm sorry, that was selfish of me,

327
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:12,940
to spoil your happy moment.
You need never say sorry to me.

328
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:15,740
How are you?

329
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,780
Really?

330
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:21,260
Since you ask, I'm wretched.

331
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:25,060
I lost my youngest child today,
I suspect forever, and I can't

332
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:29,060
see any way round it. I wish
you knew how much I want to help.

333
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:33,860
Do you?

334
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:38,820
I think you know I do.

335
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:52,780
I'll see if I can get up tomorrow.
Oh, don't be foolish.

336
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:57,620
You're ill and in all probability,
you'll be a lot iller in the morning.

337
00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:00,860
How will you manage?
What about the wedding?

338
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:05,540
I'm not sure there'll be a wedding,
but I won't burden you with it.

339
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:11,140
Perhaps Mr Mosley could come on a
permanent basis, until I'm better.

340
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:14,160
I doubt that's a
solution, Mr Carson.

341
00:23:14,161 --> 00:23:17,140
Neither my patience or his
liver could stand it.

342
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:28,740
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
Who is it?

343
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:32,620
I'm sorry, My Lord, we
never settled a time

344
00:23:32,621 --> 00:23:35,180
you wanted to be woken.
Early, I think,

345
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:38,460
with everyone ill, seven.

346
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,900
I'll breakfast at half past.

347
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:43,980
Very good, My Lord. Good night.

348
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:55,460
This isn't fair.

349
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:59,140
I'm placing you in an impossible
situation.

350
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:01,660
I want to be with you.

351
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:06,180
Let me.

352
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,740
I see.

353
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:19,460
You don't want me now. I want you
with every fiber of my being

354
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:22,460
but it isn't fair to you,
it isn't fair to anyone.

355
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:25,420
I wish I were different.
I wish everything was.

356
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:29,340
(GASPS)

357
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:33,100
I don't want you different.

358
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:37,580
I like you the way you are.

359
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:42,220
Thank you for that.

360
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:45,700
I will cherish it.

361
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:47,780
Truly.

362
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:30,000
What can I bring to help?

363
00:25:30,001 --> 00:25:32,780
Ice, to bring her temperature down.
Mrs Hughes.

364
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:38,340
Sir Richard telephoned this morning.
He's coming down to help.

365
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:41,700
Can you have some rooms made ready
for him and his valet?

366
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:45,300
And tell Mrs Patmore.
Very good, m'lady.

367
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:57,260
'I don't accept I'm ruining her
life!'

368
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:01,260
Nor cutting her off from her family.
You cut her off, that's your decision!

369
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:05,540
How will you look after her?! How
can you hope to provide for her?

370
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:09,820
You seem to think she can only be happy
in some version of Downton Abbey.

371
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:14,300
If she wanted that life,
she would not be marrying me.

372
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:17,340
Very well.

373
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:22,100
I'd hoped to avoid this, but I see
that I can't!

374
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:26,300
How much will you take to leave us
in peace?

375
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:29,180
What?
You must have doubts.

376
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:32,980
You said your own mother thinks
you're foolish. Yes, she does.

377
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:37,460
Yield to those doubts and take enough
to make a new life back in Ireland.

378
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:41,740
I'll be generous if we can bring
this nonsense to an end. I see.

379
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:44,340
You know your trouble, My Lord?

380
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:49,660
You're like all of your kind, you think
you have the monopoly of honour!

381
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:52,500
Doesn't it occur to you
that I believe the best

382
00:26:52,501 --> 00:26:55,300
guarantee of Sybil's
happiness lies with me?

383
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:58,660
Well, if you're not prepared
to listen to reason!

384
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:03,140
I'm not prepared to listen to insults.
Then, I'll bid you good day.

385
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:05,740
And I want you to leave the village.

386
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:09,380
Even though she'll come to me
the moment I call?

387
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:14,700
Do you really want me to leave now, when
I will take her with me that same hour?

388
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:29,020
Ah, there you are.
Dr Clarkson's here.

389
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:32,100
Cora's not at all well.
Sybil and Edith are with her.

390
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:36,060
Mary's gone to meet Sir Richard
from the train. Why's he coming?

391
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:39,740
He wants to be useful.
I don't see how. My Lord.

392
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:42,240
We're two more maids down.
I hope you forgive

393
00:27:42,241 --> 00:27:44,700
some catch as catch can
in the days ahead.

394
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:48,020
Which maids? Not Jane?
No, My Lord. Not Jane.

395
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:52,020
Thank you.
What are they doing?

396
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:55,820
Decorations for the wedding.
It still hasn't been cancelled.

397
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:58,380
They have to prepare for it.

398
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:01,240
If Anna or Jane appear,
tell them to come

399
00:28:01,241 --> 00:28:04,060
and help me do the
room for Sir Richard.

400
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:07,580
I can help with the bedroom then
I'll sort out a room for his man

401
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:10,180
and serve at dinner.
I can't pay you. Call it rent.

402
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:14,420
The awful truth is the wedding
simply cannot go ahead.

403
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:17,060
Don't say that.
I must.

404
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:21,100
Dr Clarkson says you'll be groggy
for at least a week, maybe longer.

405
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:24,220
We have to face the facts.
What about my father?

406
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:29,460
Matthew can telephone him.
He can't come here while everyone's ill.

407
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:33,780
He has a weak chest, we mustn't
take the risk. All right.

408
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:37,140
I suppose we've made a decision,
then, to delay?

409
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:42,100
I don't think we've got any choice.
No. I'm afraid we don't.

410
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:48,500
At least she doesn't seem
too serious. No, no.

411
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:52,460
I'd say she's been lucky. I am
terribly sorry about the wedding.

412
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:55,500
These things are sent to try us.

413
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:58,260
Why didn't anyone tell
me she was like this?

414
00:28:58,261 --> 00:29:00,980
She took a turn for the
worse half an hour ago.

415
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:04,620
Where were you?
Out, I went for a walk.

416
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:13,660
There we are, m'lady, that's better,
isn't it?

417
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:16,400
She's been with her all night.

418
00:29:16,401 --> 00:29:19,100
O'Brien, you must have a rest.
Not just now, My Lord.

419
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:22,040
I want to see her through
the worst, if I can.

420
00:29:22,041 --> 00:29:24,940
I'll just make this
cooler for you.

421
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:29,300
How is she, really?
Tell me the truth.

422
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:34,020
I can't yet. Dr Clarkson says we
will know more in a few hours.

423
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:36,100
God almighty! How can this be?

424
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:40,980
My whole life gone over a cliff
in the course of a single day.

425
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,360
(BELL RINGS)
Take care of that, thank you.

426
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:53,960
How are you doing?
I'm not sure.

427
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,560
Her ladyship's worse.
I'm sorry.

428
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:01,360
Jane said you wanted to see me.
I've done it. I've booked the registrar.

429
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:05,720
(SNIGGERS) When for?
He's had a cancellation

430
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,920
so it's Friday afternoon.
This Friday? (BABY GURGLES)

431
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:16,480
Ethel, what are you doing here?
The Bryants have turned up aga...

432
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,800
That's what.

433
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:23,640
I'll find Mrs Hughes and come back
for you.

434
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,920
I hope I haven't kept you waiting.
No, no.

435
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:38,320
We have illness in the house so I hope
you'll excuse Lord and Lady Grantham.

436
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:42,600
It's not them we've come to see,
is it? Is she here?

437
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,920
She's just coming now.

438
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:54,720
May I meet him properly?

439
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:58,320
Come along, Charlie.

440
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:01,560
This nice lady is your grandmother.

441
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,480
Perhaps you could call me, "Gran"?

442
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:07,160
He's a stout little chap, isn't he?

443
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,600
And so like Charles. I thought it
when we were last here.

444
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:15,440
I know what was said at the time
and Mr Bryant's sorry for it now.

445
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:18,400
But I could see he was just like
Charles.

446
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:22,240
Never mind all that, let's get down
to business. Business?

447
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:25,140
That's what you want
from us, isn't it?

448
00:31:25,141 --> 00:31:28,000
Find out what me mean to do for
little Charlie in the future?

449
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,380
What do you mean, "She might die"?
What do you think

450
00:31:33,381 --> 00:31:36,120
happens with a fatal illness?
The fairies come?

451
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:40,240
If anything happens to her, it
won't be your fault, Miss O'Brien.

452
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,560
I've never seen such care.

453
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:46,480
I wish I could talk to her, that's
all. But she doesn't know me.

454
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:50,600
I'm sure she knows how hard you've
worked for her. It's not that.

455
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,640
There's something I nee...

456
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,960
Never mind.

457
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,880
Either I will or I won't.

458
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:04,160
You never know people, do you.
You can work with

459
00:32:04,161 --> 00:32:07,040
them for 20 years, you
don't know them at all.

460
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,680
What? You mean give him up?

461
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:13,160
Never see him again?
Those are my terms.

462
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:18,920
But would it hurt if Ethel were
to care for him in your own house?

463
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,960
She could be his nurse.
That might be possible.

464
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,760
Of course she can't be his nurse.
We need to bring him up as a gentleman.

465
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:29,460
Send him to Harrow and
Oxford, and all the

466
00:32:29,461 --> 00:32:32,120
while his mother's in
the servant's hall.

467
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,080
How does that work? I could

468
00:32:34,081 --> 00:32:36,000
- No, we want to raise
his as our grandson,

469
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:41,360
not as a housemaid's bastard!
Well, he has to know the truth sometime.

470
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,720
Maybe, but not for a long time.

471
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,420
Till then, his father had
a wartime marriage until

472
00:32:46,421 --> 00:32:49,080
he died and his mother
succumbed to Spanish flu.

473
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:53,080
A lot of people have.
We've quite a few upstairs.

474
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:57,040
And that, for many years at least,
is all that Charlie will be told.

475
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:59,640
So, I'm just to be written out?

476
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:02,420
Painted over? Buried?
What matters is what's

477
00:33:02,421 --> 00:33:05,160
good for Charlie.
And what's good for you!

478
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:10,440
You've got a heart, I know you have.
You see what he's asking?

479
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:14,720
Ethel, consider this. In the world
as it is, compare the two futures.

480
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:18,360
The first, as my heir.
Educated, privileged, rich.

481
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:21,520
Able to do what he wants,
marry whom he likes.

482
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:24,460
The second, as the bastard son

483
00:33:24,461 --> 00:33:27,360
- I think we've heard enough of
that word for one day. Very well.

484
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:31,560
As the nameless offshoot
of a drudge,

485
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,040
you're his mother.

486
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,680
Which would you choose for him?

487
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:45,000
Suppose I could be his nurse and never
tell him who I am. I promise that.

488
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:49,040
Surely ... Come on! We all know that's
a promise you could never keep.

489
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,540
(DOOR OPENS) I'm sorry,
Mrs Hughes, we need the

490
00:33:51,541 --> 00:33:54,000
doctor at once.
Her ladyship's much worse.

491
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:58,120
I'm afraid ... Go where you're needed,
we've had our say.

492
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:01,880
You know how to reach us
when you've made your decision.

493
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:05,000
Come along, Daphne.

494
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:18,840
O'Brien?

495
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:21,160
Is that you, O'Brien?

496
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,320
Yes, m'lady, it's me, m'lady.

497
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:28,400
You're so good to me.

498
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,960
You've always been so good.

499
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:36,160
Not always, m'lady.
So good.

500
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:39,000
No.

501
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:44,200
And the fact is, I want to ask
so much for your forgiveness.

502
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:50,240
Because I did something once
which I bitterly regret. Bitterly.

503
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:54,400
And if you could only know
how much ... So very good.

504
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:59,280
(DOOR OPENS)

505
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,760
How is she?
She slept and she seemed better.

506
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,800
Then suddenly the fever came back.

507
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:16,680
O'Brien, thank you for the way
you've looked after her. I mean it.

508
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:19,720
I'm very grateful, whatever comes.

509
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:29,800
What a marathon, but I think I got
them all.

510
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:33,600
Everyone sends love. I told your
father I'll telegraph him

511
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:37,520
as soon as it's safe for him
to come. But not before.

512
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:41,680
Well, I don't think I should
leave you alone. (SIGHS)

513
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:44,360
But if you don't tell.

514
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:53,240
I've been thinking about
the date for the rematch and...

515
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,760
What is it?

516
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,360
I wonder if we haven't been rather
lucky.

517
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,400
Why, I think we've both been very
lucky.

518
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:08,360
That we've been given a second
chance. A second chance at what?

519
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:13,160
To be quite, quite sure about
what we're doing.

520
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,560
Darling, what can you mean?
The thing is, ...

521
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
I might as well say it.

522
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:28,400
When I came downstairs and you
and Mary were dancing, ...

523
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,520
I heard what you said.

524
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:38,040
And I saw what you did. That was ...
No, I'm not in a rage, in a fury,

525
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:40,880
in fact, I think it's
noble of you to want

526
00:36:40,881 --> 00:36:43,680
to keep your word when
things have changed.

527
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:47,480
But I'm not sure it would be right
for me to hold you to it.

528
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:50,720
Lavinia, I can explain.
No, listen.

529
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:53,880
I've had lots of time to think about
it.

530
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,280
I love you very, very much.

531
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,640
And I've wanted to
marry you from the

532
00:37:02,641 --> 00:37:05,360
first moment I saw you.
All that is true.

533
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:08,840
But I didn't really know what I was
taking on.

534
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:12,640
It's not in me to be
queen of the county.

535
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:16,440
I'm a little person, an ordinary
person

536
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:19,600
and when I saw you and Mary
together, I thought,

537
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:24,200
how fine, how right you looked
together.

538
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:27,400
I don't want to hear this!
You must!

539
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,680
Because it isn't a sudden thing.

540
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:36,600
I was starting to worry and then,
when you were wounded,

541
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:40,200
I thought it was my calling
to look after you.

542
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,280
And care for you.

543
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,900
And I don't think
Mary would have done

544
00:37:46,901 --> 00:37:49,320
that quite as well as me, really.
No, no.

545
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:52,080
Not nearly as well.

546
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,840
I do have some self worth.

547
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,540
Just not enough to make you
marry the wrong person.

548
00:38:01,541 --> 00:38:04,440
This is pointless, Mary is
marrying somebody else.

549
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,160
Is she?

550
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,200
We'll see.

551
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:13,920
I won't let you do this.
You will.

552
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:21,200
We won't fight about it now.

553
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,400
In fact, I'm tired.
Can I rest for a bit?

554
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:30,600
We'll talk later.
Of course.

555
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:54,360
It's good of you to come but I don't
really see what you can do.

556
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,060
I thought I'd better do my bit.

557
00:38:57,061 --> 00:38:59,720
The chauffer's gone so
I could drive the car.

558
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,480
Preferably over the chauffer.

559
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:05,560
Father's not having an easy time
of it.

560
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,720
How's Lady Grantham?
Not well.

561
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,320
Clarkson's with her now.

562
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:15,600
And Miss Swire?
Oh, she's...

563
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:23,600
Is that why you've come? Because
I said Lavinia had been taken ill?

564
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:27,440
I was coming up anyway,
in a day or two, for the wedding.

565
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:30,000
Well, she won't be getting married
on Saturday.

566
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:32,800
Which I suppose is what you'd like
best?

567
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:36,000
But she's not seriously ill.

568
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:39,720
I see what was worrying you.

569
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,640
If Lavinia had been carried
off, you wanted to be

570
00:39:42,641 --> 00:39:45,520
here to stop Matthew from
falling into my arms

571
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:49,640
on a tidal wave of grief.
It's a tricky disease.

572
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,120
(DOOR OPENS)

573
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:57,720
His lordship's asking for you,
m'lady.

574
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:06,160
I think we should aim at a sort
of buffet dinner.

575
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,500
Then they can run in and
out as it suits them.

576
00:40:08,501 --> 00:40:10,800
Sorry to make extra work.

577
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:13,480
Never mind, it's hours like these
we must all pull together.

578
00:40:13,481 --> 00:40:16,120
This arrived in the post, Daisy.

579
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:21,680
Tea for Sir Richard in the drawing room.
I'm glad to know he's here to help(!)

580
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:25,120
I can do it.
You're very obliging, Thomas.

581
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:29,160
I can take some up to Mr Carson,
if you'd like?

582
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:34,320
Is that from your Mr Mason?
He's not mine.

583
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:39,640
What does he say? He just says,
again, we should talk about William.

584
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,360
He wants me to go to his farm.
Oh, poor man.

585
00:40:42,361 --> 00:40:45,040
Will you not visit him?
I'm not going to any farm!

586
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:48,020
You're all he's got, Daisy.

587
00:40:48,021 --> 00:40:50,960
Well, then, he's got nobody
cos he hasn't got me.

588
00:40:56,280 --> 00:41:00,200
Oh, I'm sorry, m'lady, I didn't
think you'd want to change tonight.

589
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:03,280
I don't. I just need a handkerchief.

590
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:06,560
How's her ladyship?
Not good, I'm afraid.

591
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:13,040
What is it?
I don't mean to bother you, m'lady.

592
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:15,960
Go on.
Can you keep a secret?

593
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,360
Well, I know you can.

594
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,320
You see, Mr Bates and I had a plan.

595
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:26,480
To get married this coming Friday.
What?

596
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:30,520
He's worried the police haven't
finished with him and, if he's right,

597
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,940
then, I'm not going
through it with no

598
00:41:32,941 --> 00:41:35,320
proper place in his life.
A brave decision.

599
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:39,400
Or a stupid one.
Anyway, with her ladyship ill now

600
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,780
and half the servants on their
backs and everybody working

601
00:41:41,781 --> 00:41:44,120
- Where is the marriage to be?

602
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:47,120
Just in a register office in Ripon.

603
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:52,000
It wouldn't take long but... Go.
I'll cover for you. We're all here.

604
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:55,200
You won't help mama by changing your
plans.

605
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:58,160
You better come. She's worse.

606
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:04,040
I've given her the epinephrine.
Doctor! Oh, no!

607
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:06,480
What does that mean?

608
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:09,760
It's a hemorrhage of the mucus
membranes.

609
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,920
It's not unusual.

610
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:14,000
(VOMITS)

611
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:18,120
It's all right, m'lady, don't worry.
Everything's going to be all right.

612
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:22,400
Everything is clearly not all right.
How bad is it?

613
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:26,240
If she lasts through the night,
she'll life.

614
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,680
What about the others?

615
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,080
Come with me.

616
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:37,000
I'll be back shortly.
(GROANS)

617
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,600
I've given some medicine
to Mrs Hughes.

618
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:45,600
She'll bring it up later. I gather
her ladyship is not improving.

619
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:49,520
We'll, er, we'll know more tomorrow.
And Miss Swire?

620
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:52,420
Not too bad, I think.
I'll go to her when I've

621
00:42:52,421 --> 00:42:55,280
seem the rest of the servants.
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

622
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,520
Ah.

623
00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:01,400
Thank you, sir. Here we are,
Mr Carson.

624
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:04,680
Now, have you got everything
you need?

625
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:08,480
M'lady.

626
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:16,280
I want to thank you for coming up,
m'lady. Not at all.

627
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:21,480
I mean it. I know I've been
a disappointment to you.

628
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,560
Maybe.

629
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:29,440
But I've relied on your support for
too long to do without it entirely.

630
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:33,200
You'll always have my support,
m'lady. And you, mine.

631
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,880
On which subject...

632
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:39,240
I should be careful of Thomas.

633
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:44,600
Oh, I don't know how we're to get
rid of him after all this.

634
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:49,480
I doubt he'll want to stay a footman
forever, so, watch out.

635
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:04,360
You look very smart, Thomas.
I still have the shirt, m'lady.

636
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:08,160
And I found my livery in the
cupboard so I thought, "Why not?"

637
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:14,760
I have a place for you here.

638
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:21,920
How's Lavinia?
All right, I think.

639
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:26,760
The illness has made her rather
confused. What do you mean?

640
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,400
Matthew! Mary!

641
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:32,520
Is it mama?

642
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:35,200
That's what's so... It's Lavinia.

643
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:46,160
Let him go to her. Let him be with
her. Surely you owe her that?

644
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:51,760
What happened?
This is how I found her.

645
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:54,280
It's bad, I'm afraid.

646
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:56,440
Very bad.

647
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:02,800
The worst. I don't understand.
When I was with her, she was fine.

648
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:07,680
It's a strange disease with sudden,
savage changes.

649
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:14,640
I'm terribly sorry. What can I do?
Can I talk to her? Yes. Of course.

650
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:21,080
My darling. Can you hear me?

651
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:23,360
It's me. It's Matthew.

652
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:25,920
Matthew.

653
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:32,360
I'm so glad you're here.
Of course I'm here.

654
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,400
Darling, where else would I be?

655
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:38,880
Isn't this better?

656
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:42,760
Really?
I don't understand you.

657
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:48,240
You have to make our decision.

658
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:54,800
Be happy.

659
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:57,120
For my sake.

660
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:02,600
Promise me.

661
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,440
It's all I want for you.

662
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:12,680
Remember that.

663
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:22,760
That's what I want.

664
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:25,080
But I can't be happy.

665
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:29,200
Not without you.
How could I be happy?

666
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:36,500
What are you doing?

667
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:39,540
They were put up for the wedding,
Mr Crawley.

668
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:41,980
My dear chap.

669
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:45,220
I cannot find the words to say how
sorry I am.

670
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:48,660
How is cousin Cora?

671
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:52,660
Much better, thank you.

672
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:54,980
Glad to hear it.

673
00:47:55,020 --> 00:47:57,220
I came to see if there's
anything I can do.

674
00:47:57,221 --> 00:47:59,420
We've taken care of all that.

675
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:02,980
We always use Grassby's. Of course.
Travis suggested Monday for the

676
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:07,460
funeral to give people time to get
here. It will be in tomorrow's paper.

677
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:09,940
That's very kind of you.

678
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:13,420
Mary wanted to see you.
No!

679
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:15,460
I mean, I...

680
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:18,360
don't really want to see anyone.
Not yet.

681
00:48:18,361 --> 00:48:21,220
Now I know everything's
settled, I'll go back.

682
00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:25,180
When you speak to her father,
do ask him to stay here.

683
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:27,380
Thank you.

684
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:29,820
He'll be very grateful.

685
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:33,580
Just tell me what you want me to do
and I'll do it.

686
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:47,220
Are you feeling more yourself?

687
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:49,380
A bit.

688
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:52,340
I still can't get over it.

689
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:56,260
I hope you'll not pretend you liked
her now.

690
00:48:56,300 --> 00:49:00,060
I didn't want her here,
Mrs Hughes, I'll admit.

691
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:05,060
But I had no objection to her being
happy somewhere else.

692
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:07,740
A sight to gladden my heart.

693
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:10,460
Is it? I hope it is.

694
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:15,220
You gave us quite a fright.
They told me about Lavinia.

695
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:19,340
The funeral is on Monday.

696
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:21,700
I'd like to go, if I can.

697
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:35,540
We're all right,

698
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:38,140
aren't we, Robert?

699
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:41,900
Of course we are.

700
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:45,880
I got so caught up in
everything, I think

701
00:49:45,881 --> 00:49:48,860
I neglected you and
if I did, I'm sorry.

702
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:51,540
Don't apologise to me.

703
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:02,100
Ethel!

704
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:05,500
Whatever are you doing here at this
time of night?

705
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:09,680
I said I'd be back with
my answer and here I am.

706
00:50:09,681 --> 00:50:12,300
You know we're a
house in mourning?

707
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:15,180
Yes and I'm sorry.

708
00:50:16,220 --> 00:50:20,340
But, if anything, it's made my mind
up for me.

709
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:24,460
Life is short and what's my life
without Charlie?

710
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:29,980
They're not having him.
As long as you're sure.

711
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:32,560
They say they can do
better for him but what's

712
00:50:32,561 --> 00:50:35,100
better than his mother's love?
Answer me that.

713
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:37,340
I'll write and tell them.

714
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:43,060
You agree with me, though, don't
you?

715
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:45,620
My opinion has no place in this.

716
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:11,700
'I, John Bates.'
'I, John Bates.'

717
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:15,820
'Take thee, Anna May Smith.'
'Take thee, Anna May Smith.'

718
00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:19,100
'To be my wedded wife.'
'To be my wedded wife.'

719
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:23,420
'I, Anna May Smith.'
I, Anna May Smith.

720
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:27,140
Take thee, John Bates.
Take thee, John Bates.

721
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:30,620
To be my wedded husband.
To be my wedded husband.

722
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:33,100
And now the ring.

723
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:42,100
With this ring I plight thee
my troth.

724
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:46,180
With this ring I plight thee
my troth.

725
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:50,420
As a symbol of all we have promised.
As a symbol of all we have promised.

726
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:54,060
And all that we share.
And all that we share.

727
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:59,620
It therefore gives me great pleasure

728
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:03,100
to say you are now husband and wife
together.

729
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:25,420
You rang, My Lord?

730
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:31,780
I keep forgetting Carson's ill.
Mrs Hughes says he's much better.

731
00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:34,740
I really want Bates. He'd gone out.
He's in your dressing room.

732
00:52:34,741 --> 00:52:37,660
He went up with
your evening shirt.

733
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:40,180
Golly, is that the time?

734
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:44,340
Actually, can you stay a moment?

735
00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:48,940
I was trying to think how to contrive
a meeting and here you are.

736
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:53,780
You see ...
I'm glad Lady Grantham's better.

737
00:52:53,820 --> 00:52:56,700
Truly.

738
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:58,980
And don't worry.

739
00:52:59,020 --> 00:53:02,020
There's no harm done.

740
00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:05,220
No harm done yet.

741
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:09,940
I'm almost packed.

742
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:13,180
And I've given in my notice.

743
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:45,780
This is the name and address
of my man of business.

744
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:50,540
Why?

745
00:53:50,580 --> 00:53:53,380
You don't owe me anything.

746
00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:56,460
Oh, it's not for you.

747
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:59,220
It's for Freddie.

748
00:53:59,260 --> 00:54:01,860
Let me give him a start in life.

749
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:07,580
I'm not sure ...
It would make me very happy.

750
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:11,500
If I thought that, then I'd take it,
gladly.

751
00:54:13,620 --> 00:54:16,020
Will you be happy?

752
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:18,260
Really?

753
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:23,220
I have no right to be unhappy,
which is almost the same.

754
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:25,260
Almost.

755
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:31,580
Not quite.

756
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:38,540
Can I kiss you before I go?

757
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:19,420
The secret Mrs Bates.

758
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:22,420
We will tell everyone but I thought
we should leave it a while.

759
00:55:22,421 --> 00:55:25,380
At least till after
the funeral, anyway.

760
00:55:25,420 --> 00:55:29,420
You'll have to control yourselves.
Well, we've had enough practise.

761
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:38,180
Come with me.

762
00:56:02,060 --> 00:56:05,220
Smuggle Bates in here
when everyone has gone to bed.

763
00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:08,780
And for heaven's sake,
make sure he gets the right room.

764
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:12,100
I don't know what to say, m'lady.

765
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:14,860
Who did all this?
Jane.

766
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:18,220
I told her. She said it would be her
leaving present.

767
00:56:18,260 --> 00:56:21,540
You can stay all night.
She won't tell.

768
00:56:21,580 --> 00:56:24,380
M'lady, thank you.

769
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:27,300
Very, very much.

770
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:32,980
Are you sure you should be up,
Mr Carson?

771
00:56:33,020 --> 00:56:36,420
I wanted to check the silver before
tomorrow.

772
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:40,100
I think I've cleaned all the pieces
we might need.

773
00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:44,660
We'll get everything ready
the moment breakfast is over.

774
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:48,380
Thank you for the way you've kept it
all going, Thomas.

775
00:56:48,420 --> 00:56:51,340
I wish I knew how to express
my gratitude.

776
00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:54,140
You'll find a way, Mr Carson.

777
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:06,780
I think that's everything we owe.

778
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:10,860
Thank you, Mrs Hughes.
I'm sorry you're going, Jane.

779
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:14,020
You're a good worker.
I wish you well.

780
00:57:14,060 --> 00:57:16,700
I'm sorry, too, Mrs Hughes.

781
00:57:16,740 --> 00:57:20,420
But in the end I think it's for the
best.

782
00:57:20,460 --> 00:57:22,660
For everyone.

783
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:27,060
When all is said and done, my dear,
you may be right.

784
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:45,380
Well, ... Mrs Bates?

785
00:57:47,940 --> 00:57:51,300
You've had your way with me.

786
00:57:56,860 --> 00:58:00,140
I just hope you don't live to regret
it.

787
00:58:02,180 --> 00:58:04,540
I couldn't regret it.

788
00:58:04,580 --> 00:58:07,100
No matter what comes.

789
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:13,380
I know only that I am now
who I was meant to be.

790
00:58:18,420 --> 00:58:21,260
I'm not worthy of you,
that's all I know.

791
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:27,020
And they'll call me names
for pulling you into my troubles.

792
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:33,140
Mr Bates.

793
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:37,500
We've waited long enough to be
together, you and I.

794
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:39,740
And now that we're man and wife,

795
00:58:39,780 --> 00:58:43,140
can that not be enough,
just for this one night?

796
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:09,360
Earth to earth,

797
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:11,400
ashes to ashes,

798
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:14,320
dust to dust.

799
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:20,040
In sure and in certain hope of the
resurrection to eternal life

800
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:22,520
through our lord, Jesus Christ,

801
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:28,080
we shall change our vile body that it
may be like unto his glorious body,

802
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:30,600
according to the mighty working

803
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:35,560
whereby he is able to subdue
all things to himself.

804
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:37,600
Amen.

805
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:39,480
(ALL) Amen.

806
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:48,160
Would you give him a moment?
Of course, ma'am, I understand.

807
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:01,280
We better get moving if we're
to be back before they arrive.

808
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:05,720
Mrs Patmore and Thomas will go ahead
in the trap. They'll sort it out.

809
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:08,960
Hmm, I've no doubt Thomas
will have everything sorted out.

810
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:13,160
I'm sorry but it's no good thinking
we'll get shot of him now.

811
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:16,080
Why doesn't that come as a surprise?

812
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:34,400
I've been hoping I might meet you
here one day.

813
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:39,440
I expect you'll come as often
as I try to do?

814
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:42,200
It was a funeral...

815
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:45,440
of a lady that was going to marry
Mr Crawley.

816
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:47,960
I heard about that.

817
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:52,040
There's nothing so wrong as when
young folks die.

818
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:58,960
Nay, needn't hide your tears from
me, love.

819
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:06,240
It does me good to see how much you
loved him, it does.

820
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:14,320
You must tell me if there's anything
I can do.

821
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:17,120
Anything at all.
Thank you.

822
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:19,440
But I don't think so.

823
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,600
That night when we were dancing.

824
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:29,240
Lavinia came downstairs.

825
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:33,880
She heard, she...

826
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:38,560
She saw everything.

827
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:41,320
How terrible for her.

828
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:45,800
I'm so sorry.
Because of what she saw,

829
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:49,000
she thought we should cancel
the wedding.

830
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:53,760
That I belonged with you.

831
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:55,960
Not with her.

832
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:03,240
She gave up because of us.
She said tome when she was dying,

833
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:05,760
"Isn't this better?"

834
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:11,000
I know it's a cliche but...

835
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:16,120
I believe she died of a broken
heart because of that kiss.

836
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:20,160
We were the ones who killed her.

837
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:24,360
Oh, Matthew. I could never be happy
now. Don't you see?

838
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:27,360
We're cursed, you and I.

839
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:30,480
And there's nothing to be done
about it.

840
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:34,720
Let's be strong, Mary.

841
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:39,240
Let's accept that this is the end.

842
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:43,480
Of course it's the end.

843
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:47,840
How could it not be?

844
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:55,480
I'm so very sorry about this.

845
01:02:57,880 --> 01:03:00,000
Thank you.

846
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:04,360
Can I walk you up to the house
or...? Certainly, you can.

847
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:07,320
I want you to.

848
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:26,600
So sad.

849
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:32,880
Why are you here? To pay my respects
to Miss Swire. And to see Sybil.

850
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:36,360
Lady Sybil! Papa, what's the point
in all that nonsense?

851
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:41,720
I suppose you'll go to Dublin now,
isn't that your plan? In a day or two.

852
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:46,000
Mama is well again and I see no
reason to delay.

853
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:50,040
Although, I do so wish
we could have parted friends.

854
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:54,440
What about you?
Do you want to part friends?

855
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:58,080
I do. Although I don't expect to.

856
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:02,960
All right.

857
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:06,920
What?

858
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:10,720
Well, if I can't stop you,
I see no profit in a quarrel.

859
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:15,200
You'll have a very different life
from the one you might have lived,

860
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:18,000
but if you're sure it's what you
want?

861
01:04:18,040 --> 01:04:20,080
I am.

862
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:24,520
Then you may take my blessing
with you, whatever that means.

863
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:29,400
Oh, Papa! It means more than
anything! More than anything!

864
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:38,440
If you mistreat her, I will personally
have you torn to pieces by wild dogs.

865
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:40,520
I'd expect no less.

866
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:44,280
Will you come over for the wedding?
We'll talk about that later.

867
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:47,880
And there'll be some money.
But not much.

868
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:06,000
So, you've given in?

869
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:10,080
She would have gone anyway.

870
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:13,840
And perhaps we should let Lavinia's
last gift to us

871
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:16,680
be a reminder of what really matters.

872
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:19,920
You'll think that's soft?
Not at all.

873
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:23,840
The aristocracy has not survived
by its intransigence.

874
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:28,240
No, we must work with what
we've got to minimise the scandal.

875
01:05:28,280 --> 01:05:30,480
But what have we got to work with?

876
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:34,120
You'd be surprised.
He's political, isn't he?

877
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:36,400
And a writer.

878
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:38,880
I could make something out of that.

879
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:42,280
And there's a family called Branson

880
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:44,960
with a place not far from Cork.

881
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,980
I believe they have a
connection with the Howards.

882
01:05:47,981 --> 01:05:50,960
Surely we can hitch
him onto them?

883
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,960
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

884
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:59,520
Mr Bates! You all right,
Mrs Patmore? I'm all right.

885
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:04,680
There are two men waiting for you
in the servants hall.

886
01:06:21,040 --> 01:06:23,600
Are you looking for me?
John Bates?

887
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:27,600
Yes. You are under arrest
on the charge of willful murder.

888
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:31,160
You are not obliged to say anything
unless you desire to do so.

889
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:33,900
Whatever you say will be
taken down in writing and

890
01:06:33,901 --> 01:06:36,600
may be given in evidence
against you upon trial.

891
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:38,800
I understand.

892
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:42,600
No! No!
Please, ... do whatever is required.

893
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:47,960
I love you.
And I love you.

894
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:52,280
For richer, for poorer.
For better, for worse. Come along, sir.

895
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:43,520
