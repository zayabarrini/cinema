1
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,639
Mary, the men are arranging
the concert now

2
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,759
and they are so anxious
for us both to be in it,

3
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,120
or there'll be no girls at all.
Please say you will.

4
00:00:52,121 --> 00:00:54,159
Do I have to?
Yes, you do.

5
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,119
Keeping their spirits up
is an important part of the cure
and so very little to ask.

6
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,879
What's going on?
The men are putting on a concert.

7
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,079
Can I help?
Edith has it under control.

8
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:08,160
I do, if Mary's willing.
Oh, all right.
One song, and that's your lot.

9
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,880
What time is Doctor Clarkson's
round? It's already happened.

10
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,319
Without me? Why?
I'm not very late.

11
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,879
We didn't see the need to wait.
Mrs Hughes, I need to steal you
for a minute.

12
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,799
I have to check the linen books.
But I went over them last week.

13
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:26,039
Very good, m'lady. I'll get started.
Surely I can...

14
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,239
Anna, can you tell Mrs Patmore
it'll be easier for me to go through
the menus this afternoon?

15
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,279
Of course, Your Ladyship.

16
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,760
Cousin Cora - Please, can it wait?
I've a mountain to get through.

17
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,080
There's a parcel for you.
Thank you.

18
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,520
There's a little one for you.

19
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,519
This one looks as if it's been
opened, but it hasn't.

20
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,600
Ethel, have you nothing to do?

21
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:05,360
I was keeping her talking.
You mustn't blame her. I don't.

22
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,680
What a lovely day!

23
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Are you quite sure about Lavinia?
She wasn't Sir Richard's mistress.

24
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,240
She gave him the evidence to settle
a debt of... someone she loved.

25
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,759
And this is your beau, is it?

26
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,159
A man who lends money, then uses it
to blackmail the recipient?

27
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,040
He lives in a tough world.
And will you be joining him there?

28
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:38,800
Richard Carlisle is powerful.
He's rich and getting richer.

29
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,640
He wants to buy a proper house,
you know - with an estate.

30
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,919
He says, after the war, the market
will be flooded and we can take
our pick. Oh?

31
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,160
And you can dance on the grave
of a fallen family.

32
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,159
They will fall, lots of them.

33
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,240
Some won't rise again,
but I don't intend to be among them.

34
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:02,479
That leaves Matthew.
That's done now, Granny. Finished.

35
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,520
It's time to move forward.

36
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,839
What about Sybil?
Does she have anyone in her sights?

37
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:15,160
Not that I know of. Are you sure
she has no chap in mind? How odd!

38
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:21,080
I had an endless series of crushes
at her age. I don't think so.

39
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:25,240
Not even some man she doesn't care
to mention? What do you mean?

40
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,079
Well, war breaks down barriers

41
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,559
and when peacetime re-erects them,

44
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:44,159
You cannot be so contrary.
I'm a woman, Mary.

45
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,160
I can be as contrary as I choose.

46
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,079
But I don't understand.
The patients are always served
their luncheon at 12:30.

47
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,239
Well, today they'll be served at one.
Is this something I can help with?

48
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:00,599
Mrs Patmore seems to be disobeying
my instructions and I can't get to
the reason why.

49
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,639
If you mean the patients' new
lunchtime,

50
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,039
Her Ladyship felt it made the staff
luncheon unreasonably early.

51
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:10,199
She moved it, so they could eat at
noon. But that will interfere with
the nurses' shifts.

52
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,160
Oh no, she's altered those, too.
Has she, indeed?

53
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,480
Well, we'll see about that.

54
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,920
It was always a question of when.

55
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,560
May I have a word?
Can it wait?
No, it cannot wait.

56
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,959
I've just come from downstairs,

57
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,159
where I learnt that my timetable
has been wantonly disregarded.

58
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,199
If you mean the new lunchtime,

59
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:44,879
the wretched servants were having
to eat at 11 and then starve until
their tea at six, so I...

60
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,479
You've also torn up
the nurses' timetable.
I haven't torn up anything...

61
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,279
It would be foolish to accuse you
of being unprofessional,

62
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,399
as you've never had a profession
in your life. Now, just a minute!

63
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,359
You may think you have the right
to ordain the universe,

64
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,199
but in this field -
No, not in this field - in this
house, yes, I do have the right,

65
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,119
given me by Doctor Clarkson
and by the law of the land!

66
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,439
This is my house, and I am in charge
right alongside you!

67
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,119
If you would stop your bullying -
That's enough!
I will not listen to this.

68
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:16,240
If I am not appreciated here,
I will seek some other place where
I will make a difference. Good.

69
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:22,799
I mean it. I cannot operate where
I am not valued. You must see that!

70
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,800
Certainly.

71
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,160
I shall go. I will.

72
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,280
Perhaps it would be best.

73
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,720
I repeat - I mean it.

74
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,680
I'm sure you do - and so do I.

75
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:46,439
Why did you promise Carson
not to stage any more protests,

76
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,720
when you wouldn't promise me?
I had my reasons.

77
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,999
But you won't be content to stay
at Downton forever, will you?

78
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,480
Tinkering away at an engine
instead of fighting for freedom?

79
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,160
I thought you'd join the rising
in Dublin last Easter.

80
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,600
I might have... if it hadn't been put
down in six short, bloody weeks.

81
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:10,599
But don't fret. The real fight for
Ireland will come after the war,
and I'll be ready for it.

82
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:22,560
The truth is, I'll stay in Downton
until you want to run away with me.

83
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,840
Don't be ridiculous.
You're too scared to admit it...

84
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,760
but you're in love with me.

85
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,840
Branson, could you take me
into Ripon at three?

86
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,919
I'm getting some things for Mama.
Is there anything you want?

87
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,920
Nothing you can find in Ripon!

88
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,919
Well... it IS her house.
Does that mean she's suddenly
received a medical training?

89
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:54,079
No - Or are you like everyone else
in thinking that, because
she's a countess,

90
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,519
she has acquired universal knowledge
by divine intervention?

91
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,960
Mrs Crawley, convalescent homes
are not about medical training.

92
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:05,200
They are far more to do with good
food, fresh air and clean sheets.

93
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,479
Very well. I've had a letter
from a cousin in Paris

94
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,439
who is working for the Wounded
And Missing Enquiry Department.

95
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,480
They've opened a branch
in Northern France
under the aegis of the Red Cross.

96
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:22,079
I shall offer them my services.
Well, that's... that's very drastic.

97
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,359
I have to go where I am useful

98
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,480
and that place, I'm afraid,
is no longer Downton Abbey.

99
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,400
You'll be missed.
By you, possibly.

100
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,360
I hope so, anyway.

101
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,440
But not, I think, by Lady Grantham.

102
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:44,520
♪ If you were the only girl
in the world

103
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:50,440
♪ And I were the only boy ♪

104
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,839
I wish we had a man.

105
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,400
Amen!
It would sound so much richer,

106
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,040
but all the volunteers
are spoken for.

107
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,039
How's it going?
All right, I suppose,

108
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:05,159
if you don't mind singers who can't
sing and actors who can't act!

109
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:09,960
It helps to keep their spirits up.
So they say,
although I can't think why.

110
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,960
I had a letter this morning
from Sir Richard Carlisle. Oh?

111
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,120
He...

112
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:21,280
He tells me he proposed
when he was staying here.

113
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:25,600
He apologises for not asking my
permission, but he's asking it now.

114
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,279
Have you decided?
Is that why he's written?

115
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,679
No... but I have made the decision.

116
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,440
Which is?
I think I should take him.

117
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:39,479
Do you really, my darling? I wish
I could believe in your motives.

118
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:42,440
Why? What were your motives
when you married Mama?

119
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,520
Your mother has made me very happy.

120
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,079
Perhaps Sir Richard
will make ME very happy.

121
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:53,000
What about Matthew?
Not you, too! Poor Matthew...

122
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,399
What must he do to persuade you
he's in love with Lavinia?

123
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,840
Open his chest and carve her name
on his heart?

124
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:05,439
Write to him. Tell him of your plans
with Carlisle. You owe him that.

125
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,119
I don't think I "owe" him anything,

126
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,120
but I'll write to him, if you like.

127
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,119
I'll try to send you an address,

128
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,160
but you can always get me through
the Red Cross. Very good, ma'am.

129
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:22,799
I'll try to contact Captain Crawley,
explain to him what's happened.

130
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,799
If he does get leave, he'll probably
come to me or stay in London,

131
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,559
but if I miss him and he turns up
here, I know you'll look after him.

132
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:34,439
Of course I will, ma'am.
Cook him what he likes -
not what's good for him.

133
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:38,960
You don't know when you'll be back?
I don't think one knows anything
in wartime.

134
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:45,360
I'll try to give you warning. In
the meantime, look after yourselves.

135
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,480
Now, I mustn't miss my train.

136
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,840
So, what now?

137
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,119
Ah, Anna said you were honouring us
with your presence at dinner.

138
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,120
It's easier here than the hospital.

139
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:23,480
I can always get changed back
into my uniform if I need to.

140
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:28,840
What were you talking to Branson
about when I came into the yard?

141
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,040
Nothing.

142
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,760
Then why were you there?

143
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:38,000
Why were YOU there?
Because I was ordering the motor.

144
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,239
That is why one talks to chauffeurs,
isn't it?

145
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,240
To plan journeys by road?

146
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,680
He is a person.
He can discuss other things.

147
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:52,039
I'm sure he can - but not with you.
What do you want from me?

148
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:56,079
Am I to see if Sir Richard Carlisle
has a younger brother -
one even richer than he is?

149
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,799
Darling, what's the matter with you?
I'm on your side.

150
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,800
Then be on my side!

151
00:11:02,774 --> 00:11:06,453
'So there we have it.
I look forward to introducing
the two of you

152
00:11:06,454 --> 00:11:08,613
just as soon as you are next
at home,

153
00:11:08,614 --> 00:11:11,773
which naturally
I trust will be very soon indeed.

154
00:11:11,774 --> 00:11:14,254
Please be glad for me,
as I will always be for you.

155
00:11:14,255 --> 00:11:16,814
Your affectionate cousin, Mary.'

156
00:11:17,494 --> 00:11:22,373
We don't need anyone with us.
The Sergeant knows what we're doing.
But what are we patrolling for?

157
00:11:22,374 --> 00:11:25,693
You've been taking those logic pills
again! This is the army, Mason.

158
00:11:25,694 --> 00:11:28,653
We're going on a patrol
because we're going on a patrol.

159
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:31,693
Has Mary set a date yet
for the wedding? She doesn't say.

160
00:11:31,694 --> 00:11:35,093
I think she's hoping
the war will be over soon
and they can set a date then.

161
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:38,693
She could've waited and told you
when she saw you. She doesn't know
I'm due back.

162
00:11:38,694 --> 00:11:42,933
Did you warn Daisy, or will it be
a surprise? No, I've told her we're
coming to Downton first.

163
00:11:42,934 --> 00:11:45,773
Then I'll visit my dad and go back
to see her for a day at the end.

164
00:11:45,774 --> 00:11:50,814
fresh Yorkshire air,
followed by London and Miss Swire.
All right for some, sir!

165
00:11:51,614 --> 00:11:54,574
You'd never swap, though, would you?
No, I'd never swap.

166
00:11:56,054 --> 00:11:59,933
Bates in a pub? I can't see that.
I think your pal's mistaken.

167
00:11:59,934 --> 00:12:03,334
He met him here twice
before the war. Listen.

168
00:12:04,214 --> 00:12:08,774
I said to him, "Hello,
Mr Bates," and he walked off
and wouldn't serve me after.

169
00:12:10,134 --> 00:12:14,733
Next thing you know, we'll have Anna
running across the county and
dragging him back by his stick!

170
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,893
I'm surprised he isn't here of his
own accord,

171
00:12:16,894 --> 00:12:19,933
with His Lordship having no valet
since the loony went.

172
00:12:19,934 --> 00:12:23,214
Don't speak ill of Mr Lang.
You're a funny one!

173
00:12:23,854 --> 00:12:25,854
Talk about sweet and sour.

174
00:12:26,574 --> 00:12:28,574
Better get back.

175
00:12:41,254 --> 00:12:43,254
Want a cup?

176
00:12:44,214 --> 00:12:46,214
Not really.

177
00:12:47,014 --> 00:12:50,054
What were you doing?
Oh, let me see.

178
00:12:51,414 --> 00:12:53,933
I've tidied the study - twice

179
00:12:53,934 --> 00:12:56,574
and I've rearranged the coats
in the hall.

180
00:12:57,454 --> 00:13:00,734
I might check his clothes for moth.
What about you?

181
00:13:01,454 --> 00:13:03,853
We've cleaned everything
three times over

182
00:13:03,854 --> 00:13:06,733
and I've sent Beth into the village
for some eggs to pickle,

183
00:13:06,734 --> 00:13:08,973
though the Mistress
doesn't really like them.

184
00:13:08,974 --> 00:13:11,974
Well, she never eats properly,
anyway. Not on her own.

185
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:14,854
A butler can't do much
with supper on a tray!

186
00:13:16,974 --> 00:13:20,173
Beg your pardon for troubling you,
only the door was open.

187
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:22,814
But the front gate was not.
No.

188
00:13:24,014 --> 00:13:27,453
What do you want?
Have you got any spare food?

189
00:13:27,454 --> 00:13:30,854
"Spare food"?
What's that, when it's at home?

190
00:13:34,614 --> 00:13:36,614
Hang on, hang on. Wait.

191
00:13:41,574 --> 00:13:43,693
From around here?
Not far.

192
00:13:43,694 --> 00:13:46,974
I used to work on the farms,
but er... not any more.

193
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:53,574
Did you get that in the war? Don't
pity me. I'm one of the lucky ones.

194
00:13:57,334 --> 00:13:59,334
I might have something for you.

195
00:14:00,574 --> 00:14:02,574
Come on.

196
00:15:05,534 --> 00:15:08,134
Hello, Mr Molesley.
They told me you were up here.

197
00:15:09,574 --> 00:15:13,333
I hope you don't mind
my bothering you.
Not a bit. What can I do for you?

198
00:15:13,334 --> 00:15:17,774
Well, actually, Mr Carson, I've been
thinking there might be something I
can do for YOU. Hm?

199
00:15:18,374 --> 00:15:20,374
That brushing, for instance.

200
00:15:24,534 --> 00:15:27,134
I don't like having nothing to do,

201
00:15:28,134 --> 00:15:32,734
what with Captain Crawley
away at the war and his mother
in France alongside him.

202
00:15:32,934 --> 00:15:37,294
And then, His Lordship's
without a valet and...
and your plate is piled so high!

203
00:15:37,694 --> 00:15:39,694
I am quite occupied, it's true.

204
00:15:39,854 --> 00:15:42,334
So I thought I'd look in
and give you a hand,

205
00:15:43,494 --> 00:15:46,894
brushing, mending, cleaning shoes -
whatever's needed.

206
00:15:47,374 --> 00:15:49,653
That's kind of you, Mr Molesley.

207
00:15:49,654 --> 00:15:55,573
We shall have to watch ourselves, or
else His Lordship will want to pinch
you off Captain Crawley.

208
00:16:01,854 --> 00:16:05,573
But he said he'd be here by now
and he's not.
You mustn't worry about him, Daisy.

209
00:16:05,574 --> 00:16:10,013
I'm not "worried" like that, exactly,
but this is William.
I think we should all be worried.

210
00:16:10,014 --> 00:16:13,013
Anything might have happened.
Maybe his leave was cancelled.

211
00:16:13,014 --> 00:16:17,013
At times like these, people vanish
and turn up again
in the strangest places.

212
00:16:17,014 --> 00:16:19,014
Like Mr Bates in that pub.

213
00:16:21,694 --> 00:16:25,773
Working in a public house?
That's what he said.
I thought they'd have told you.

214
00:16:25,774 --> 00:16:28,773
It doesn't seem likely
that a trained valet like Mr Bates

215
00:16:28,774 --> 00:16:31,573
would be content to work
in a public house!

216
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:34,934
Well, that's what he said.
Have you mentioned this to Anna?

217
00:16:35,414 --> 00:16:38,733
I haven't said anything to anyone.
I thought you all knew.

218
00:16:38,734 --> 00:16:43,534
Perhaps you should ask Thomas.
Oh, I will ask Thomas.
Don't you worry about that, my girl.

219
00:16:44,174 --> 00:16:48,493
Didn't it occur to you that
we might be interested to hear it?
Not particularly.

220
00:16:48,494 --> 00:16:53,174
As far as I knew, Mr Bates had left
your employment.
You didn't think to tell Carson?

221
00:16:53,414 --> 00:16:56,414
I am not under Mr Carson's command
now, Your Lordship.

222
00:17:03,854 --> 00:17:07,214
Shoo! Daisy, go to bed
before you strain your eyes!

223
00:17:14,334 --> 00:17:17,893
Thank you, Daisy,
for telling Mr Carson
all about my private letter!

224
00:17:17,894 --> 00:17:20,973
I didn't know it was a secret.
Sorry if I was wrong.

225
00:17:20,974 --> 00:17:22,974
There's no "if" about it.

226
00:17:25,414 --> 00:17:27,414
Why answer His Lordship at all?

227
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:31,374
What did you want me to do?
Tell him to get knotted?

228
00:17:32,014 --> 00:17:35,094
He doesn't pay your wages.
I see.

229
00:17:35,374 --> 00:17:38,333
Well, I won't put you down
for a career in diplomacy, then!

230
00:17:38,334 --> 00:17:41,174
What's he after? To get Bates back?

231
00:17:42,414 --> 00:17:46,014
If Mr Bates wanted his job back,
he'd have written for it himself.

232
00:17:46,534 --> 00:17:49,574
Why would he want his job back?
He's like you. He got away.

233
00:17:49,934 --> 00:17:53,293
He's not very like me, thank you.
But you're both free

234
00:17:53,294 --> 00:17:56,733
of all the bowing and scraping
and "Yes, m'lord," and "No, m'lord."

235
00:17:56,734 --> 00:17:59,414
I envy him. I envy you.

236
00:18:00,414 --> 00:18:03,814
Cos I'm ready for a new adventure
and I don't care who hears me.

237
00:18:04,734 --> 00:18:08,134
"Be careful what you wish for."

238
00:18:24,934 --> 00:18:29,294
'The truth is, I'll stay in Downton
until you want to run away with me.'

239
00:18:37,494 --> 00:18:40,373
Ah. Good morning, Anna.
You sent for me, m'lord?

240
00:18:40,374 --> 00:18:42,374
I did. Come in.

241
00:18:43,374 --> 00:18:46,614
I have something to tell you,
but I hope I'm right.

242
00:18:47,254 --> 00:18:49,854
Carson didn't want you
to be troubled with it.

243
00:18:50,374 --> 00:18:52,774
Is this about Mr Bates, m'lord?
Yes, it is.

244
00:18:53,894 --> 00:18:58,253
I have no wish to upset you, but it
seems he may be back in Yorkshire
working in a public house.

245
00:18:58,254 --> 00:19:00,133
We don't yet know where.

246
00:19:00,134 --> 00:19:02,134
The Red Lion in Kirby Moorside.

247
00:19:03,814 --> 00:19:05,814
Oh.

248
00:19:08,374 --> 00:19:11,614
You've seen him, then?
I have, yes, m'lord.

249
00:19:13,214 --> 00:19:15,214
And he's well?
He is.

250
00:19:17,414 --> 00:19:20,014
He's not been back to Downton
for two reasons.

251
00:19:21,374 --> 00:19:26,054
He's hoping to settle certain matters
first... with Mrs Bates.

252
00:19:27,094 --> 00:19:29,814
And does he think he can?
He believes so, m'lord.

253
00:19:30,254 --> 00:19:32,254
Very good.

254
00:19:32,934 --> 00:19:35,534
And what is his second reason
for avoiding us?

255
00:19:36,014 --> 00:19:38,734
He says he parted with Your Lordship
on bad terms.

256
00:19:40,094 --> 00:19:43,253
He felt it might be embarrassing.
Yeah...

257
00:19:43,254 --> 00:19:45,254
It is for me to feel embarrassed.

258
00:19:47,974 --> 00:19:52,053
I had to get out of that kitchen,
if I'm not to be found dead
under the table!

259
00:19:52,054 --> 00:19:54,933
It's like cooking a banquet
three times a day.

260
00:19:54,934 --> 00:19:58,013
It is a lot of extra work, whatever
they say - even with the helpers.

261
00:19:58,014 --> 00:20:00,014
Don't think they lighten the load!

262
00:20:02,654 --> 00:20:05,053
Mrs Bird? What's going on?

263
00:20:05,054 --> 00:20:09,774
I knew I'd be found out,
sooner or later. At least it's you.

264
00:20:10,894 --> 00:20:14,014
Found out doing what?
What does it look like?

265
00:20:14,614 --> 00:20:18,934
I don't know what it looks like,
except some kind of soup kitchen.

266
00:20:19,574 --> 00:20:21,574
You'd better come inside.

267
00:20:24,614 --> 00:20:26,614
One at a time.

268
00:20:26,974 --> 00:20:28,933
Now, take a piece of bread.

269
00:20:28,934 --> 00:20:32,254
Right. Daisy, stand there.
Give them a bowl and a spoon.

270
00:20:33,934 --> 00:20:35,934
When did all this start?

271
00:20:36,534 --> 00:20:39,054
That fella turned up asking for food.

272
00:20:39,534 --> 00:20:42,333
Then he came back next day
with a friend, and here we are.

273
00:20:42,334 --> 00:20:45,054
What does Mrs Crawley say?
She doesn't know yet.

274
00:20:45,254 --> 00:20:48,813
I suppose she'll put a stop to it
when she gets back from France.
I hope not.

275
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:52,773
To be honest, Mrs Patmore, I'm not
sure I can manage much longer.

276
00:20:52,774 --> 00:20:56,453
How often do you do it? I planned
to get it down to once a week

277
00:20:56,454 --> 00:20:58,374
and give them only the cheapest cuts,

278
00:20:58,375 --> 00:21:01,773
but it is my money, and I don't know
how much - Now, hold it right there!

279
00:21:01,774 --> 00:21:04,453
If we can't feed a few soldiers in
our own village,

280
00:21:04,454 --> 00:21:08,894
them that have taken a bullet
or worse for king and country,
then I don't know what!

281
00:21:10,814 --> 00:21:14,174
Sorry about this, m'lady, only
there's no footman to do it now.

282
00:21:14,734 --> 00:21:17,974
I don't mind, but you'd better run
before Mrs Hughes sees you.

283
00:21:19,694 --> 00:21:24,534
M'lady... could I ask something?

284
00:21:25,334 --> 00:21:29,454
Only William, who was in service
here - I know William.

285
00:21:30,334 --> 00:21:32,814
Well, he's missing.

286
00:21:33,934 --> 00:21:37,573
That is, he was supposed to be back
on leave but he never turned up.

287
00:21:37,574 --> 00:21:41,174
He wrote he was coming home for a few
days with Captain Crawley...

288
00:21:41,494 --> 00:21:44,454
Is William your beau?
I won't say that, no, m'lady.

289
00:21:45,094 --> 00:21:48,494
We're all very fond of William
downstairs. Of course you are.

290
00:21:50,014 --> 00:21:53,454
Well, I'm sure it's nothing, but
I'll see what I can find out.

291
00:21:53,934 --> 00:21:55,934
Thank you.

292
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:06,373
How do you know they
didn't change their plans?
Well, of course I don't,

293
00:22:06,374 --> 00:22:08,654
but the poor girl
seemed quite certain.

294
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:13,053
Just when Isobel's away and none of
us know where she is. Typical!

295
00:22:13,054 --> 00:22:18,254
I suppose Matthew might have heard
from Cousin Isobel and decided to
meet up in France, instead.

296
00:22:18,534 --> 00:22:21,414
But that wouldn't explain
why William isn't here.

297
00:22:23,374 --> 00:22:25,374
I'll do what I can.

298
00:22:28,414 --> 00:22:31,094
No, don't stop stirring,
the bottom will burn!

299
00:22:32,174 --> 00:22:34,174
You can leave those to Daisy.

300
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:38,174
That's it, Daisy. Put them
in the special storage area.

301
00:22:40,614 --> 00:22:43,253
What do you want?
Can I borrow some baking soda?

302
00:22:43,254 --> 00:22:46,734
"Borrow"? Why?
Are you planning to give it back?

303
00:22:52,374 --> 00:22:57,893
I might go over to Malton tomorrow.
Agatha Spenlow is madly promoting
her charity fair.

304
00:22:57,894 --> 00:23:01,773
Do you need the motor? I'm afraid
I do. Can you get Pratt to take you
in the other car?

305
00:23:01,774 --> 00:23:04,293
It doesn't matter.
I can go on Monday. But why?

306
00:23:04,294 --> 00:23:08,053
I'm told Bates is working
at a public house in Kirby Moorside.

307
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:10,093
I want to investigate.

308
00:23:10,094 --> 00:23:13,413
I can't decide which part of that
speech is the most extraordinary!

309
00:23:13,414 --> 00:23:16,814
Why can't someone else go?
Because I want to go myself.

310
00:23:19,534 --> 00:23:21,534
So, Sybil, what are you up to, dear?

311
00:23:22,214 --> 00:23:26,294
Nothing much. Working. I don't have
time to get up to anything else.

312
00:23:26,774 --> 00:23:29,894
Only Mary and I were talking
about you the other day.

313
00:23:30,654 --> 00:23:32,413
Oh?

314
00:23:32,414 --> 00:23:34,493
Yes, you see, sometimes, in war,

315
00:23:34,494 --> 00:23:37,974
one can make friendships
that aren't quite... appropriate

316
00:23:38,574 --> 00:23:40,814
and it can be awkward, you know,
later on.

317
00:23:41,014 --> 00:23:44,854
I mean, we've all done it. I just
want you to be on your guard.

318
00:23:46,374 --> 00:23:49,693
"Appropriate" for whom? Well,
don't jump down my throat, dear.

319
00:23:49,694 --> 00:23:52,853
I'm only offering friendly advice.
Why do you want to see Bates?

320
00:23:52,854 --> 00:23:55,413
To give him his old job back?
Not entirely.

321
00:23:55,414 --> 00:23:57,933
I mainly want to see him
because we parted badly.

322
00:23:57,934 --> 00:24:01,653
Telephone call for you, m'lord.
If you did, I'm sure it's his fault.

323
00:24:01,654 --> 00:24:03,654
No, it was mine.

324
00:24:08,014 --> 00:24:11,773
Oh, really! It's like living
in a second-rate hotel

325
00:24:11,774 --> 00:24:17,334
where the guests keep arriving
and no-one seems to leave!

326
00:24:20,548 --> 00:24:22,387
I see.

327
00:24:22,388 --> 00:24:25,628
Yes... Thank you
for letting me know.

328
00:24:29,068 --> 00:24:31,108
Are you all right, Papa?

329
00:24:35,388 --> 00:24:37,388
That was the War Office.

330
00:24:38,508 --> 00:24:43,427
Matthew and William went out
on a patrol a few days ago
and they haven't been seen since.

331
00:24:43,428 --> 00:24:46,147
Oh, my God.
Let's not fall to pieces quite yet.

332
00:24:46,148 --> 00:24:48,347
It happens all the time, apparently,

333
00:24:48,348 --> 00:24:51,227
and the men turn up
in one field hospital or another.

334
00:24:51,228 --> 00:24:54,827
But they are treating them
as missing in action?
It's too early for that.

335
00:24:54,828 --> 00:24:57,067
There could be lots of things
to explain it.

336
00:24:57,068 --> 00:25:00,388
You mean they could have been taken
prisoner? It's possible.

337
00:25:02,308 --> 00:25:05,507
Don't say anything to Mary...
or your mother,

338
00:25:05,508 --> 00:25:08,988
or anyone, in fact - not yet.
I shouldn't really have told you.

339
00:25:09,308 --> 00:25:12,588
What about Cousin Isobel?
I don't know how to contact her.

340
00:25:12,708 --> 00:25:15,588
Anyway, she's in France.
She may hear before we do.

341
00:25:22,628 --> 00:25:24,667
I'm not accusing her of anything,

342
00:25:24,668 --> 00:25:27,747
but I did wonder if you were aware
of this "special storage area"?

343
00:25:27,748 --> 00:25:31,308
I daresay Mrs Patmore has her own
system, like we all do.

344
00:25:32,388 --> 00:25:35,748
Right. Well, I'll say good night.
Good night.

345
00:25:37,308 --> 00:25:40,107
Ah, Mr Molesley. You're very late.

346
00:25:40,108 --> 00:25:42,867
I was doing some invisible mending
on one of his coats.

347
00:25:42,868 --> 00:25:46,948
I got a bit carried away, but I'm...
I'm quite pleased with the way it
turned out.

348
00:25:48,028 --> 00:25:51,427
I don't see why you can't dress him
until there's a new valet.

349
00:25:51,428 --> 00:25:55,588
It'd be a blessing to Mr Carson.
I'd be happy to, if it'd help.

350
00:25:56,188 --> 00:25:59,267
Keep this up, and we won't be able
to do without you at all.

351
00:25:59,268 --> 00:26:01,268
There's no reason why you should.

352
00:26:02,148 --> 00:26:04,547
Oh, er, I may be wrong,

353
00:26:04,548 --> 00:26:09,988
but I thought I saw one of the
officers by the maids' staircase
just now.

354
00:26:10,548 --> 00:26:13,307
I'm sure there's a perfectly
reasonable explanation.

355
00:26:13,308 --> 00:26:15,308
Let's hope so.

356
00:26:15,468 --> 00:26:17,468
Good night.

357
00:26:53,868 --> 00:26:55,868
What the bloody...
Ethel!

358
00:26:56,148 --> 00:26:59,668
We were only...
I know precisely what you were doing, Major.

359
00:27:00,228 --> 00:27:04,228
I may not be a woman of the world,
but I don't live in a sack!

360
00:27:04,468 --> 00:27:07,868
Now, if you would kindly
take your things and go downstairs.

361
00:27:13,628 --> 00:27:17,987
Ethel, you are dismissed without
notice and without a character.

362
00:27:17,988 --> 00:27:21,747
You will please leave before
breakfast. I didn't think I was...

363
00:27:21,748 --> 00:27:23,948
No. And that's the problem.

364
00:27:24,668 --> 00:27:26,668
You never do.

365
00:27:33,748 --> 00:27:35,748
And you're not nervous?

366
00:27:36,708 --> 00:27:39,227
Well, I gather His Lordship
knows his own mind,

367
00:27:39,228 --> 00:27:41,507
but I've no difficulty with that.

368
00:27:41,508 --> 00:27:45,107
You'll enjoy working
in a big household.

369
00:27:45,108 --> 00:27:47,628
Better than staring at me
night after night!

370
00:27:49,068 --> 00:27:51,188
What would you say
if they ask you to stay?

371
00:27:52,468 --> 00:27:55,787
It would be a big step up for me.
There's no point in denying it.

372
00:27:55,788 --> 00:27:57,788
Because I think they might.

373
00:27:59,108 --> 00:28:01,108
Do you really, Mrs Bird?

374
00:28:01,748 --> 00:28:06,267
There goes Mr Molesley,
valet to the Earl of Grantham.

375
00:28:06,268 --> 00:28:08,388
Stop it!

376
00:28:12,868 --> 00:28:14,907
But why?

377
00:28:14,908 --> 00:28:17,908
What could you have possibly done
that's so terrible?

378
00:28:18,148 --> 00:28:20,628
Have I taken everything of mine
from there?

379
00:28:23,548 --> 00:28:26,228
Would you like me to speak to her?
Because I can.

380
00:28:26,708 --> 00:28:28,708
No. She wouldn't listen.

381
00:28:30,268 --> 00:28:32,268
She's not a bad person, Mrs Hughes.

382
00:28:32,388 --> 00:28:35,748
I know she can be strict, but she's
not - She wouldn't listen.

383
00:28:53,108 --> 00:28:54,867
We're closed.

384
00:29:02,748 --> 00:29:05,107
I know Ethel could be difficult,
Mrs Hughes,

385
00:29:05,108 --> 00:29:08,067
but she was very sorry for
her mistake, whatever it was.

386
00:29:08,068 --> 00:29:11,347
I'm sure. It's cost her her job.
But surely it can't...

387
00:29:11,348 --> 00:29:15,108
Never mind why she's gone, she's
gone - and there's an end to it.

388
00:29:16,668 --> 00:29:21,308
By the way, I hear
Mr Bates is back in the county.

389
00:29:21,788 --> 00:29:23,868
Mr Carson says
you know all about it.

390
00:29:27,428 --> 00:29:29,867
I gather His Lordship
has gone to see him.

391
00:29:29,868 --> 00:29:32,468
I know. He told me he was going.

392
00:29:33,828 --> 00:29:37,228
Why in heaven's name
didn't you mention any of it to me?

393
00:29:38,308 --> 00:29:40,308
It wasn't my secret to tell.

394
00:29:40,868 --> 00:29:46,068
I'm glad to hear it, but Carson said
your wife made all sorts of threats.

395
00:29:47,348 --> 00:29:49,388
She won't carry them out - not now.

396
00:29:50,588 --> 00:29:55,188
Since I left Downton,
I've discovered
that she was... untrue to me.

397
00:29:55,988 --> 00:30:00,068
I may have been as bad in my heart,
m'lord, but I've done
nothing to be ashamed of.

398
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:03,507
The point is, I can divorce her now,
whether she likes it or not.

399
00:30:03,508 --> 00:30:06,347
But what's to stop her blurting out
her stories to the press?

400
00:30:06,348 --> 00:30:09,868
If she agrees to keep silent, I will
give her whatever she wants.

401
00:30:10,028 --> 00:30:13,708
She can't hold me now, so her choice
is between poverty and plenty.

402
00:30:14,428 --> 00:30:17,668
And what was the tale she was going
to tell? Carson never made it clear.

403
00:30:18,388 --> 00:30:21,748
Some silly nonsense, m'lord.
I wouldn't waste your time with it.

404
00:30:23,148 --> 00:30:25,148
What's the news from Downton?

405
00:30:26,508 --> 00:30:29,547
Daisy, you're not to worry
about William.

406
00:30:29,548 --> 00:30:31,867
I spoke to His Lordship earlier.

407
00:30:31,868 --> 00:30:35,627
He says you're not to be concerned
until we know more.
But he is missing.

408
00:30:35,628 --> 00:30:38,707
I mean, they don't know where he is,
or Captain Crawley, do they?

409
00:30:38,708 --> 00:30:43,187
There could be a hundred
explanations. Yes - and one of them
is that they're dead!

410
00:30:46,788 --> 00:30:49,347
Don't mistake me,
I hope very much they're not,

411
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:52,787
but we ought to face the truth.
What may be the truth.

412
00:30:52,788 --> 00:30:54,788
And what very well may not!

413
00:30:57,588 --> 00:31:01,588
Anna, do you think that Mr Bates
will come back?

414
00:31:01,828 --> 00:31:04,548
That's for him to say.
I hope he does.

415
00:31:04,908 --> 00:31:07,507
He always seems
a romantic figure to me.

416
00:31:07,508 --> 00:31:10,187
Does he? How do you define "romantic"?

417
00:31:10,188 --> 00:31:14,667
It's no good him thinking he can
turn up here without a moment's
notice and be cock of the walk!

418
00:31:14,668 --> 00:31:17,828
Why is that, Thomas?
Because the place is already taken?

419
00:31:24,148 --> 00:31:28,148
I hate the word "missing".
It seems to leave so little room
for optimism.

420
00:31:29,388 --> 00:31:32,148
I tell myself
it's too early to despair,

421
00:31:35,308 --> 00:31:37,748
but to be honest, Bates,
I don't think I can bear it.

422
00:31:37,749 --> 00:31:41,268
Losing Patrick was bad enough,
but now the thought of Matthew gone

423
00:31:42,588 --> 00:31:44,868
and the future
once again destroyed...

424
00:31:46,468 --> 00:31:48,788
More than all that,
I loved him like a son.

425
00:31:51,788 --> 00:31:55,948
No, I LOVE him. Let's stay in the
present tense, while we still can.

426
00:31:59,028 --> 00:32:02,627
So, will you come back with me...

427
00:32:02,628 --> 00:32:04,828
and help me through
the Vale of Shadow?

428
00:32:06,828 --> 00:32:10,868
It's not what I expected, m'lord,
but... I will, if you want me to.

429
00:32:13,308 --> 00:32:17,107
I misjudged you, Bates,
and I abused you when we parted.

430
00:32:17,108 --> 00:32:19,388
I should have had more faith.
I'm sorry.

431
00:32:20,268 --> 00:32:23,628
God knows, you've shown more faith
in me than I had any right to.

432
00:32:27,868 --> 00:32:30,988
There we are. Get this basket
off my arm. It weighs a ton!

433
00:32:50,868 --> 00:32:52,868
Sybil?

434
00:32:53,108 --> 00:32:55,547
I never said anything to Granny,
honestly.

435
00:32:55,548 --> 00:32:59,427
Then why did she start talking about
"inappropriate friendships"
out of nowhere?

436
00:32:59,428 --> 00:33:04,187
She thinks you must have a beau and
if we don't know about him, then you
have to be keeping him secret.

437
00:33:04,188 --> 00:33:07,067
It's just Granny being Granny.
Don't make such a thing of it.

438
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:10,668
I don't deserve to be told off - not
by her or by you. Nothing's happened.

439
00:33:13,668 --> 00:33:16,507
Why? What might have happened?
I mean it.

440
00:33:16,508 --> 00:33:19,587
We haven't kissed, or anything.
I don't think we've shaken hands!

441
00:33:19,588 --> 00:33:23,227
I'm not even sure
if I like him like that. He says
I do, but I'm still not sure.

442
00:33:23,228 --> 00:33:25,547
We are talking about...
Branson, yes.

443
00:33:25,548 --> 00:33:28,947
The chauffeur, Branson?
Oh, how disappointing of you!

444
00:33:28,948 --> 00:33:32,147
I'm just trying to get it straight
you and the chauffeur...

445
00:33:32,148 --> 00:33:35,947
You know I don't care about all of
that. Darling, don't be such a baby.

446
00:33:35,948 --> 00:33:38,468
This isn't fairyland.
What did you think?

447
00:33:38,868 --> 00:33:42,347
You'd marry the chauffeur and we'd
all come to tea? Don't be silly.

448
00:33:42,348 --> 00:33:45,668
I told you, I don't even think I like
him. What has he said to you?

449
00:33:46,828 --> 00:33:50,348
That he loves me and wants me to run
away with him. Good God in heaven!

450
00:33:50,708 --> 00:33:53,508
He's frightfully full of himself.
You don't say!

451
00:33:54,468 --> 00:33:57,467
But I haven't encouraged him.
I haven't said anything, really.

452
00:33:57,468 --> 00:34:00,308
You haven't given him away, though.
Will you?

453
00:34:01,068 --> 00:34:03,307
Well, I won't betray him
on one condition:

454
00:34:03,308 --> 00:34:05,867
You must promise
not to do anything stupid.

455
00:34:05,868 --> 00:34:08,748
You must promise now,
or I'll tell Papa tonight.

456
00:34:10,948 --> 00:34:12,948
I promise.

457
00:34:35,548 --> 00:34:40,428
Mr Bates!
You're a sight for sore eyes.

458
00:34:41,028 --> 00:34:43,268
Welcome home.
Thank you, Mrs Hughes.

459
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:48,188
I thought it was you.
Hello.

460
00:34:49,548 --> 00:34:54,068
Come away in and give some substance
to the gossip of your return.

461
00:34:59,948 --> 00:35:03,027
You'll find things a bit different
from when you left, Mr Bates.

462
00:35:03,028 --> 00:35:05,028
Downton at war.
Precisely.

463
00:35:05,428 --> 00:35:08,507
There's some extra help
in the kitchen, all very nice people

464
00:35:08,508 --> 00:35:12,227
and the nurses, of course,
but they live down at the hospital.

465
00:35:12,228 --> 00:35:15,668
Except for Lady Sybil.
Nurse Crawley, please!

466
00:35:18,468 --> 00:35:23,948
So we've both returned, you and I.
A couple of bad pennies.

467
00:35:24,148 --> 00:35:28,148
I haven't. Thomas means
he's not here as a servant.

468
00:35:28,388 --> 00:35:30,988
He manages the house.
He's a sergeant now.

469
00:35:31,428 --> 00:35:33,428
I take orders from Major Clarkson.

470
00:35:34,188 --> 00:35:37,748
He runs this place on behalf
of the Army Medical Corps.

471
00:35:38,428 --> 00:35:40,708
Yet another reason
to pray for peace!

472
00:35:41,748 --> 00:35:45,228
I heard about William from His
Lordship. And Captain Crawley.

473
00:35:46,548 --> 00:35:48,868
I'm sure they're all right.

474
00:35:50,548 --> 00:35:53,707
Sorry I'm late!
Has the dressing gong rung yet?

475
00:35:53,708 --> 00:35:55,907
You're not late, Mr Molesley,
but er...

476
00:35:55,908 --> 00:35:59,708
Mr Bates is back,
and you reminded me.
I'd better ring it now.

477
00:36:00,868 --> 00:36:05,228
Are you staying... for good?
I'd need a crystal ball to answer
that, but I'll stay for now.

478
00:36:05,948 --> 00:36:09,707
Have you been standing in for me?
I was going to,
starting tonight, yeah.

479
00:36:09,708 --> 00:36:13,028
Then you'll be relieved to see me.
Oh, tremendously.

480
00:36:13,628 --> 00:36:15,628
What's that?

481
00:36:16,188 --> 00:36:19,267
It's a new kind of shoehorn.
I bought it for His Lordship.

482
00:36:19,268 --> 00:36:21,548
That's very kind of you,
Mr Molesley. Thank you.

483
00:36:26,228 --> 00:36:29,147
Daisy, fetch me some more tea.
Thomas, I've got dinner...

484
00:36:29,148 --> 00:36:31,908
Hot, this time,
and it's Sergeant Barrow to you.

485
00:36:39,548 --> 00:36:42,667
Watch yourself, Mr Bates.
Thomas is in charge now.

486
00:36:42,668 --> 00:36:46,708
It won't do to get on the wrong side
of him. Is there a right side?

487
00:36:48,733 --> 00:36:51,892
I don't believe it.
Why would she sell food to Mrs Bird?

488
00:36:51,893 --> 00:36:53,732
It makes no sense.

489
00:36:53,733 --> 00:36:57,772
Well, I can't confirm
the details of the arrangement.

490
00:36:57,773 --> 00:37:00,933
Maybe they both sell it
and divide the proceeds.

491
00:37:01,253 --> 00:37:03,133
Either way, I felt you should know.

492
00:37:03,134 --> 00:37:06,732
Have you said anything to Mrs Hughes
or Carson? I've tried with her,

493
00:37:06,733 --> 00:37:09,373
but there's none so blind
as them that will not see.

494
00:37:10,653 --> 00:37:13,053
I'm curious.
Next time, come and fetch me.

495
00:37:15,933 --> 00:37:19,132
So Bates is back.
Papa must be pleased.

496
00:37:19,133 --> 00:37:21,133
And Mr Carson won't be sorry.

497
00:37:23,693 --> 00:37:26,373
Branson, there's something
you ought to know.

498
00:37:28,133 --> 00:37:30,133
I've told Mary.

499
00:37:31,573 --> 00:37:33,573
I see.

500
00:37:34,413 --> 00:37:37,932
Well, that's me finished, then -
and without a reference.

501
00:37:37,933 --> 00:37:40,292
No, she's not like that.
You don't know her.

502
00:37:40,293 --> 00:37:42,933
She wouldn't give us away.
But she won't encourage us.

503
00:37:43,893 --> 00:37:45,893
No.

504
00:37:47,093 --> 00:37:50,093
Why are you smiling?
I thought you'd be angry.

505
00:37:51,893 --> 00:37:55,373
Because that's the first time
you've ever spoken about "us".

506
00:37:58,493 --> 00:38:01,492
If you didn't care,
you would have told them months ago.

507
00:38:01,493 --> 00:38:04,652
Oh, I see. Because I don't want you
to lose your job,

508
00:38:04,653 --> 00:38:07,853
it must mean I'm madly in love
with you. Well, doesn't it?

509
00:38:09,253 --> 00:38:11,852
You say I'm a free spirit,
and I hope I am,

510
00:38:11,853 --> 00:38:15,212
but you're asking me to give up
my whole world and everyone in it.

511
00:38:15,213 --> 00:38:18,293
And that's too high a price to pay?
It IS a high price!

512
00:38:18,933 --> 00:38:21,172
I love my parents - you don't know them...

513
00:38:21,173 --> 00:38:23,212
and I love my sisters, my friends...

514
00:38:23,213 --> 00:38:25,613
I'm not asking you
to give them up for ever.

515
00:38:25,933 --> 00:38:28,812
When they come around,
I will welcome them with open arms.

516
00:38:28,813 --> 00:38:31,613
And what about your people?
Would they accept ME?

517
00:38:31,813 --> 00:38:36,453
And what about my work?
What work? Bringing hot drinks
to a lot of randy officers?

518
00:38:36,773 --> 00:38:40,652
Look - it comes down to whether
or not you love me. That's all.

519
00:38:40,653 --> 00:38:43,893
That's it. The rest is detail.

520
00:38:46,613 --> 00:38:49,812
I've written to Vera, spelling out
the case and how she cannot win it.

521
00:38:49,813 --> 00:38:53,213
Then I've told her I will be
generous, if she will co-operate.

522
00:38:53,773 --> 00:38:56,733
Are you ready to give her everything?
Because I am.

523
00:38:58,413 --> 00:39:01,692
Whatever it takes. I want a clean
break and not an open wound.

524
00:39:01,693 --> 00:39:04,773
If we can just be patient
a little while longer.

525
00:39:07,253 --> 00:39:10,373
We shouldn't be outside. It's cold.

526
00:39:12,773 --> 00:39:16,253
I'll be patient and bear anything,

527
00:39:20,653 --> 00:39:23,853
except for you to go away again.
No. That's done.

528
00:39:25,213 --> 00:39:29,173
You're stuck with me now...
for good and proper.

529
00:39:36,373 --> 00:39:38,453
There's something you ought to know.

530
00:39:39,453 --> 00:39:43,333
Papa said not to tell you, but I
don't think he's right. Go on.

531
00:39:45,693 --> 00:39:47,693
Matthew's missing.

532
00:39:48,053 --> 00:39:51,453
He was on patrol
and he's just sort of... vanished.

533
00:39:53,093 --> 00:39:56,133
Papa hasn't told anyone.
Not even Mama.

534
00:39:57,653 --> 00:40:00,373
I only know because I was there
when he found out.

535
00:40:01,013 --> 00:40:03,493
It didn't seem right
to keep you in the dark.

536
00:40:04,333 --> 00:40:06,293
I'm not trying to upset you, truly.

537
00:40:07,413 --> 00:40:09,413
For once in my life, I believe you.

538
00:40:24,333 --> 00:40:27,453
They've told you, then?
Do they all know downstairs?

539
00:40:28,373 --> 00:40:32,013
William's missing, too. I think
everyone knows except Her Ladyship.

540
00:40:32,693 --> 00:40:34,972
I wish Edith had left it
till the morning.

541
00:40:34,973 --> 00:40:37,973
I could have faced it all
with one more night of sleep.

542
00:40:45,933 --> 00:40:48,132
Mind out, this is hot.
Daisy! Spoons!

543
00:40:48,133 --> 00:40:50,893
Unless they're to drink
directly from the bowl!

544
00:40:51,773 --> 00:40:54,852
Do you think there's enough?
You could feed about 50, I reckon.

545
00:40:57,293 --> 00:40:59,332
Go for the vegetable one.
The vegetable...

546
00:41:00,853 --> 00:41:05,693
May we come in?
Your Ladyship... What a surprise.

547
00:41:06,333 --> 00:41:10,972
O'Brien seemed to think that you and
Mrs Bird were engaged in a commercial
venture of some sort,

548
00:41:10,973 --> 00:41:14,372
so I came to see for myself.
We are not, Your Ladyship!

549
00:41:14,373 --> 00:41:16,612
I agree
that's not what it looks like.

550
00:41:16,613 --> 00:41:20,213
We feed these men once a week
and I'm not ashamed of it.

551
00:41:21,013 --> 00:41:24,413
I'll be back before luncheon
at the big house. I'm sure.

552
00:41:25,373 --> 00:41:27,893
But is it true
they are fed from our kitchens?

553
00:41:29,093 --> 00:41:32,372
Only the stuff the army gives.
They ARE soldiers.

554
00:41:32,373 --> 00:41:36,812
What did I tell you?
Daisy's right. We only use
the food the army pay for,

555
00:41:36,813 --> 00:41:39,253
and all the men
have served their country.

556
00:41:46,173 --> 00:41:50,813
In future, I would prefer it if you
would use food paid for by the house.

557
00:41:51,853 --> 00:41:54,613
I don't want the army
to accuse us of mismanagement.

558
00:41:55,573 --> 00:41:58,492
You're going to let them get away
with it? Oh, more than that.

559
00:41:58,493 --> 00:42:00,732
I'm going to help them -
and so are you.

560
00:42:00,733 --> 00:42:05,252
Molesley. Ma'am.
If you bring that table over,
I suggest we divide the food.

561
00:42:05,253 --> 00:42:07,693
Then we can form two lines
and it will go faster.

562
00:42:08,453 --> 00:42:10,453
O'Brien, you can manage the bread.

563
00:42:11,573 --> 00:42:13,453
Daisy?
Of course, m'lady.

564
00:42:13,653 --> 00:42:16,133
Mmm... What is it?
Beef stew, m'lady.

565
00:42:16,813 --> 00:42:18,813
Stand in a line.

566
00:42:30,173 --> 00:42:32,173
Sergeant, one moment.

567
00:42:35,013 --> 00:42:38,812
I hear you're becoming
mighty imperious in your manner
with the staff here.

568
00:42:38,813 --> 00:42:40,813
Er, Daisy in particular.

569
00:42:41,133 --> 00:42:45,733
Just because you're a poacher
turned gamekeeper, there's no need
for rudeness. No, sir.

570
00:42:46,493 --> 00:42:48,493
So mind what I say.

571
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:51,333
Carry on.

572
00:42:55,813 --> 00:42:57,813
I've done as you asked, Mrs Hughes.

573
00:42:58,333 --> 00:43:00,333
I think Barrow's taken it on board.

574
00:43:00,693 --> 00:43:04,173
He's getting grander than Lady Mary,
and that's saying something!

575
00:43:06,973 --> 00:43:09,293
Lady Grantham.
Hello, Doctor Clarkson.

576
00:43:22,653 --> 00:43:25,573
It was Bates.
I saw him watching you.

577
00:43:26,813 --> 00:43:31,292
He must have gone straight
to the Major and sneaked on you
the moment your back was turned.

578
00:43:31,293 --> 00:43:33,973
Oh, well. Some things never change.

579
00:43:34,373 --> 00:43:38,093
Don't worry. He's more vulnerable
than when he was last here.

580
00:43:39,213 --> 00:43:43,573
Why?
Because we know more, that's why.

581
00:43:45,733 --> 00:43:48,293
Why haven't you told me till now?
I'm not sure.

582
00:43:49,093 --> 00:43:51,093
Perhaps I envied your ignorance.

583
00:43:52,053 --> 00:43:54,413
I'm not giving up hope. Not yet.

584
00:43:55,333 --> 00:43:59,493
Nor me, of course, but I think
we should start to prepare.

585
00:44:01,093 --> 00:44:03,093
Isobel doesn't know?

586
00:44:03,613 --> 00:44:05,613
I haven't been able to reach her.

587
00:44:05,813 --> 00:44:09,613
Have you said anything to Mary?
Edith's already told me.

588
00:44:10,613 --> 00:44:14,973
Has she? Well, I suppose
it was too tempting to resist.

589
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:18,973
Oddly enough, I don't think
she was trying to make trouble.

590
00:44:19,933 --> 00:44:23,252
We ought to go down.
It's time for the concert.

591
00:44:23,253 --> 00:44:25,453
Who cares about the stupid concert?

592
00:44:25,973 --> 00:44:27,973
The men do, and we should, too...

593
00:44:28,973 --> 00:44:31,572
because we have to keep going,
whatever happens.

594
00:44:31,573 --> 00:44:33,573
We have to help each other
to keep going.

595
00:45:04,933 --> 00:45:08,653
Cora tells me Matthew's gone
missing. Is that true?

596
00:45:09,093 --> 00:45:12,492
There's no proof of anything yet.
I see.

597
00:45:12,493 --> 00:45:15,093
Well, I need more than that
to make me anxious.

598
00:45:16,373 --> 00:45:20,013
I'm glad you would be anxious.
Of course I would be.

599
00:45:21,533 --> 00:45:25,853
We're used to Matthew now.
God knows who the next heir will be.

600
00:45:26,773 --> 00:45:30,573
Probably a chimneysweep
from Solihull! Huh!

601
00:45:46,173 --> 00:45:48,252
Most of you won't know
how rare it is

602
00:45:48,253 --> 00:45:51,252
to see my sister Edith and I
pulling together in a double act...

603
00:45:51,253 --> 00:45:53,332
A unicorn, if ever there was one.

604
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:57,613
But in wartime
we, like all of you, have more
important things to worry about.

605
00:45:58,093 --> 00:46:01,732
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you... the Crawley Sisters.

606
00:46:01,733 --> 00:46:05,413
Well, now I've seen everything!

607
00:46:06,533 --> 00:46:11,373
♪ Sometimes when I feel bad

608
00:46:11,493 --> 00:46:15,613

00:47:29,613 --> 00:47:32,493
My dear boy. My very dear boy!

621
00:47:38,813 --> 00:47:40,813
Come on, don't stop for me.

626
00:48:17,553 --> 00:48:19,712
Somehow, we got lost

627
00:48:19,713 --> 00:48:22,992
and then we were trapped behind some
Germans for three days.

628
00:48:22,993 --> 00:48:26,152
When we got out of that, we stumbled
into a field dressing station,

629
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:28,192
where we were immediately admitted.

630
00:48:28,193 --> 00:48:30,832
We weren't in any danger,
so they didn't inform our unit.

631
00:48:30,833 --> 00:48:33,752
They should have jolly well told us
when you got back to base.

632
00:48:33,753 --> 00:48:36,512
I hope you weren't really worried.
Oh, you know us.

633
00:48:36,513 --> 00:48:38,712
We like to be sure of our hero
at the front.

634
00:48:38,713 --> 00:48:42,753
I beg your pardon, m'lord, but
the Dowager Countess is leaving. Ah.

635
00:48:47,753 --> 00:48:49,912
What will you do
with the rest of your leave?

636
00:48:49,913 --> 00:48:53,233
Well, since Mother isn't here, I'll
run up to London and see Lavinia.

637
00:48:56,553 --> 00:49:00,113
I got your letter about Carlisle.
I hope you'll approve.

638
00:49:00,753 --> 00:49:03,432
I know you don't like him much now -
I hardly know him,

639
00:49:03,433 --> 00:49:07,233
but I'm sure I'll like him when I do.
That's if he's good to you.

640
00:49:07,993 --> 00:49:10,193
If he's not,
he'll have me to answer to.

641
00:49:17,433 --> 00:49:20,992
Who'd have thought
an amateur concert
could be the summit of all joy?

642
00:49:20,993 --> 00:49:23,793
I've lived in such a fog of misery
since I left you,

643
00:49:24,393 --> 00:49:27,193
I think I'd forgotten what happiness
is. Me, too.

644
00:49:28,193 --> 00:49:30,993
But now we must get used to feeling
happy... and trust it.

645
00:49:31,433 --> 00:49:33,433
God, I want to.

646
00:49:39,353 --> 00:49:41,473
Love's young dream?
I don't think!

647
00:49:42,393 --> 00:49:44,393
I'm not sure I care much.

648
00:49:44,993 --> 00:49:46,993
Are you going soft in your old age?

649
00:49:47,313 --> 00:49:50,872
I don't like him -
he's a patronising bastard
who sneaks behind my back,

650
00:49:50,873 --> 00:49:53,432
but I've got other things to worry
about. Really?

651
00:49:53,433 --> 00:49:55,952
That's interesting.
Why?

652
00:49:55,953 --> 00:49:58,553
Because obviously,
I hold a grudge longer than you.

653
00:50:00,113 --> 00:50:03,513
I knew nothing bad had happened.
I felt it in my waters!

654
00:50:04,393 --> 00:50:07,313
What about you?
Did you have me boxed up and buried?

655
00:50:07,833 --> 00:50:10,393
I am glad you're all right, honest.
You should be.

656
00:50:10,913 --> 00:50:13,393
It's the thought of you
that keeps me going.

657
00:50:27,913 --> 00:50:30,433
Hello? Hello?

658
00:50:39,233 --> 00:50:44,393
Ethel? What on earth
are you doing here?

659
00:50:44,673 --> 00:50:46,673
I had to come, Mrs Hughes.

660
00:50:48,113 --> 00:50:52,072
I'm sorry to push in,
but I was sitting alone until
I couldn't stand it no more.

661
00:50:52,073 --> 00:50:55,473
You've got to help me.
I haven't "got to" do anything!

662
00:50:56,273 --> 00:50:58,353
But what do you mean?
Help with what?

663
00:50:59,313 --> 00:51:01,553
Is this about Major Bryant?

664
00:51:05,233 --> 00:51:09,353
I blame myself for not stepping in
earlier - that I will admit.

665
00:51:10,633 --> 00:51:13,193
How long had it been going on?

666
00:51:16,313 --> 00:51:18,313
Long enough to get me pregnant.

667
00:51:19,633 --> 00:51:21,633
Mrs Hughes, I'm going to have a baby.

668
00:51:24,673 --> 00:51:28,232
I wish I'd not written that letter
now, what with everything else
going on.

669
00:51:28,233 --> 00:51:30,193
She'll come up here
and make trouble.

670
00:51:30,194 --> 00:51:31,872
Don't badger me, please!

671
00:51:31,873 --> 00:51:35,993
Sometimes a hard sacrifice must be
made for a future
that's worth having.

672
00:51:38,553 --> 00:51:41,513
The cold and careful
Lady Mary Crawley!

673
00:51:41,913 --> 00:51:45,432
Do you still expect me to marry
you... knowing this?

674
00:51:45,433 --> 00:51:49,632
I'll sell my story anyway -
about Lady Mary, the Turkish
gentleman, Miss Smith here...

675
00:51:49,633 --> 00:51:52,552
It's got nowt to do with me.
That's not what I heard.

676
00:51:52,553 --> 00:51:55,272
M'lady, wake up.
What on earth...

677
00:51:55,273 --> 00:51:56,913
You'd better come downstairs.

678
00:51:56,938 --> 00:52:02,238
