Episode 4

4
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,285
When does it open?
Tomorrow afternoon.

5
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,600
Well, let's get up a party in
the evening, if Mrs Hughes lets us.

6
00:00:50,635 --> 00:00:53,880
After we've had our dinner.
You're right. It doesn't come often.

7
00:00:53,915 --> 00:00:57,360
And it doesn't stay long.
What about you, Mr Bates?

8
00:00:57,395 --> 00:00:59,697
I don't see why not.

9
00:00:59,732 --> 00:01:01,965
There's Lady Mary.

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,640
You go on ahead.
I'll see you back at the house.

11
00:01:04,675 --> 00:01:06,525
Right you are, then.

12
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,040
Good day, milady.
Is her ladyship all right?

13
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,080
Has she recovered from...?

14
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,560
If you think she'll ever recover
from carrying the body of Mr Pamuk

15
00:01:18,595 --> 00:01:20,440
from one side of the house
to the other,

16
00:01:20,475 --> 00:01:22,285
then you don't know her at all.

17
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,040
Well, I didn't mean recover exactly.

18
00:01:25,075 --> 00:01:27,645
Just... get past it.

19
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,725
She won't do that, either.

20
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,920
When she dies they'll cut her open
and find it engraved on her heart.

21
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,965
What about you?

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,885
What about your heart?

23
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:42,760
Haven't you heard?
I don't have a heart.

24
00:01:42,795 --> 00:01:44,800
Everyone knows that.

25
00:01:44,835 --> 00:01:46,760
Not me, milady.

26
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,680
You wanted to see the new
chauffeur, milord? Indeed.

27
00:01:56,715 --> 00:01:58,160
Please send him in.

28
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,765
Come in. Come in.
Good to see you again.

29
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,445
Branson, isn't it?
That's right, your lordship.

30
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:10,000
I hope they've shown you everything,
and delivered whatever we promised.

31
00:02:10,035 --> 00:02:13,400
Certainly, milord.
Won't you miss Ireland?

32
00:02:13,435 --> 00:02:15,605
Ireland, yes, but not the job.

33
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,100
The mistress was a nice lady,
but she only had one car,

34
00:02:18,135 --> 00:02:20,560
and she wouldn't let me drive it
over 20 miles an hour.

35
00:02:20,595 --> 00:02:22,565
So, it was a bit...

36
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,765
well, boring, so to speak.

37
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,440
You've got a wonderful library.

38
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,000
You're very welcome to borrow books,
if you wish.

39
00:02:32,035 --> 00:02:34,605
Really, milord?

40
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,480
There's a ledger that I make
everyone use, even my daughters.

41
00:02:37,515 --> 00:02:40,757
Carson and Mrs Hughes sometimes
take a novel or two.

42
00:02:40,792 --> 00:02:44,000
What are your interests?
History and politics, mainly.

43
00:02:44,035 --> 00:02:45,720
Heavens.

44
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,840
Carson, Branson is going
to borrow some books.

45
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:52,605
He has my permission.
Very good, milord.

46
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:57,000
Is that all, milord?
It is. Off you go, and good luck.

47
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,700
He seems a bright spark
after poor old Taylor.

48
00:03:06,735 --> 00:03:09,645
And to think Taylor's gone off
to run a tea shop!

49
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,040
I cannot feel it will make for
a very restful retirement, can you?

50
00:03:14,075 --> 00:03:16,560
I would rather be put to death,
milord.

51
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,240
Quite so. Thank you, Carson.

52
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,685
How about some house parties?

53
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,020
She's been asked to one next month
by Lady Anne McNair.

54
00:03:28,055 --> 00:03:31,285
That's a terrible idea.
She doesn't know anyone under 100.

55
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,600
I might send her to visit my aunt.
She could get to know New York.

56
00:03:34,635 --> 00:03:37,045
Oh, I don't think things
are quite that desperate.

57
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,520
Poor Mary. She's been terribly
down in the mouth lately.

58
00:03:40,555 --> 00:03:43,520
She was very upset by the death
of poor Mr Pamuk.

59
00:03:43,555 --> 00:03:46,085
Why? She didn't know him.

60
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,085
One can't go to pieces
at the death of every foreigner.

61
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,000
We'd all be in a state of collapse
whenever we opened a newspaper.

62
00:03:53,035 --> 00:03:56,880
Oh, no. Of course,
Mary's main difficulty

63
00:03:56,915 --> 00:03:59,937
is that her situation is unresolved.

64
00:03:59,972 --> 00:04:02,925
I mean, is she an heiress
or isn't she?

65
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:06,285
The entail's unbreakable.
Mary cannot inherit.

66
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:11,200
No, what we need is a lawyer who's
decent and honour-bound to look into it.

67
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,920
I... I think, perhaps,
I know just the man.

68
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,200
Are you going to the fair?
I shouldn't think so, sir.

69
00:04:22,235 --> 00:04:24,337
But I don't mind it.
I like the music.

70
00:04:24,372 --> 00:04:26,440
Goodness, what's happened
to your hands?

71
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,820
It's nothing, ma'am.
They look very painful.

72
00:04:30,855 --> 00:04:33,765
Oh, no, ma'am.
Irritating more than painful.

73
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,200
Have you been using anything new
to polish the silver or the shoes?

74
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:38,965
No.
May I?

75
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,120
Leave him alone, Mother.

76
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,445
It looks like erysipelas.

77
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,365
You must have cut yourself.
Not that I'm aware of.

78
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,440
We'll walk to the hospital tomorrow.
Really, ma'am - I insist.

79
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,020
If you've got a cold,
I want you out of here.

80
00:05:08,055 --> 00:05:11,005
Anna, they are.
You know I'm out tonight?

81
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:14,325
Because I don't want to come home
to any surprises. Huh!

82
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,880
That'll be the day. We thought
we might go to the fair later.

83
00:05:17,915 --> 00:05:19,885
You'd like that,
wouldn't you, Daisy?

84
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,480
Now, you ought to go.
She's been that down in the mouth

85
00:05:22,515 --> 00:05:24,397
since the death of poor Mr Pamuk.

86
00:05:24,432 --> 00:05:26,245
Don't say that.
Well, she has!

87
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,400
We could all walk down together
after the servants' dinner.

88
00:05:29,435 --> 00:05:32,365
You won't be walking anywhere.

89
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,640
She's got minutes to live,
by the sound of it.

90
00:05:34,675 --> 00:05:37,057
Go to bed at once.

91
00:05:37,092 --> 00:05:39,405
Yes, Mrs Hughes.

92
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,605
I'll bring up a Beechams powder.

93
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,880
Right, if there's anything
you want to ask me,

94
00:05:43,915 --> 00:05:45,677
it'll need to be before I go.

95
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:47,405
What would I want to ask you?

96
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,360
I'm preparing a meal for Lord
and Lady Grantham and the girls.

97
00:05:50,395 --> 00:05:52,520
No-one is visiting.
No-one is staying.

98
00:05:52,555 --> 00:05:54,605
Well...

99
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,600
that's settled, then.

100
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,040
I'm afraid Dr Clarkson's out
delivering a baby.

101
00:06:02,075 --> 00:06:04,605
We don't know when he'll be back.
No matter.

102
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:07,725
If you open the store cupboard,
I can easily find what I need.

103
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:11,360
Well - Tell the doctor you opened it
for the chairman of the board.

104
00:06:11,395 --> 00:06:14,840
I assure you he will raise
not the slightest objection.

105
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,840
This should do it -
tincture of steel,

106
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:23,400
10 drops in water three times a day.

107
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,120
And this is solution
of nitrate of silver.

108
00:06:28,155 --> 00:06:30,365
Rub a little in morning and night.

109
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,780
How long before it's better?
Erysipelas is very hard to cure.

110
00:06:33,815 --> 00:06:37,160
We should be able to reduce
the symptoms, but that might be all.

111
00:06:37,195 --> 00:06:39,080
Oh, and you must wear gloves
at all times.

112
00:06:39,115 --> 00:06:41,325
I couldn't...

113
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,925
wait a table in gloves
I'd look like a footman.

114
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:47,360
You may have to do. The tincture
and the salve will help.

115
00:06:47,395 --> 00:06:49,880
Try it for a week, and we'll see.

116
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,540
Someone to see you, Mr Crawley.

117
00:06:54,575 --> 00:06:56,640
Well, there's nothing in my diary.

118
00:06:56,675 --> 00:06:58,565
It's Lady Grantham.

119
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,800
Well, in that case,
show her in at once.

120
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,600
Cousin Cora, to what do I owe the -

121
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,760
I hope I'm not a disappointment.

122
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,525
I thought it might be nice
to cheer it up a bit.

123
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:18,120
Easier said than done.
Perhaps a flower or a bit of veil.

124
00:07:18,155 --> 00:07:20,685
I can find you a veil, if you like.

125
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,800
I hope you're not expecting
ME to do it.

126
00:07:22,835 --> 00:07:24,880
Not if you're busy, of course.

127
00:07:24,915 --> 00:07:27,805
Good.
And Miss O'Brian?

128
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,165
I've sent Anna to bed with a cold,

129
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,900
so I need you to manage
the young ladies.

130
00:07:32,935 --> 00:07:35,565
What, all three of them?
I'm not an octopus.

131
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:39,280
Why can't Gwen do it?
Because she is not a lady's maid.

132
00:07:39,315 --> 00:07:42,960
I am not a slave.
Just do it, Miss O'Brien.

133
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:45,720
Just do it.

134
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,280
I'll pay you the compliment that I
do not believe you wish to inherit

135
00:07:51,315 --> 00:07:54,405
just because nobody's
investigated properly.

136
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,680
No, but - Nor can Mary
accuse you of making trouble

137
00:07:57,715 --> 00:08:00,285
when you will suffer most
from a discovery.

138
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:03,160
You're right that I don't wish
to benefit - at Mary's expense -

139
00:08:03,195 --> 00:08:06,165
from an ignorance of the law.
Putting it bluntly,

140
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,240
do you think Robert has
thrown in the towel prematurely?

141
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,400
Good heavens! What am I sitting on?

142
00:08:12,435 --> 00:08:15,085
A swivel chair.
Ooh.

143
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,560
Another modern brainwave?
Invented by Thomas Jefferson.

144
00:08:18,595 --> 00:08:21,965
Why does every day involve
a fight with an American?

145
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,520
I'll fetch a different one.
No, no, no. I'm a good sailor.

146
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:32,000
It will depend on the exact terms
of the entail and of the deed of gift

147
00:08:32,035 --> 00:08:35,320
when cousin Cora's money
was transferred to the estate.

148
00:08:35,355 --> 00:08:40,320
That is all I ask,
to understand the EXACT terms.

149
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,800
Is Daisy going to the fair tonight
with the others?

150
00:08:56,835 --> 00:08:59,480
Why don't you ask her?
She needs taking out of herself.

151
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,120
What's it to you?
Nothing.

152
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:12,440
Daisy, I was hoping - Would you like
to go to the fair with me, Daisy?

153
00:09:12,475 --> 00:09:15,720
There's a few of us going later on.
Do you mean it?

154
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,960
Daisy, don't let it get cold!

155
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,560
Come on, come on, come on!

156
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,640
You bastard.

157
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,320
Why is Sybil having
a new dress and not me?

158
00:09:36,355 --> 00:09:38,845
Because it is Sybil's turn.

159
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,520
Can it be my choice this time?
Of course.

160
00:09:41,555 --> 00:09:43,525
As long as you choose
what I choose.

161
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:47,000
Branson, you'll be taking
Lady Sybil to Ripon tomorrow.

162
00:09:47,035 --> 00:09:50,440
She'll be leaving after lunch.
Certainly, your ladyship.

163
00:09:50,475 --> 00:09:51,885
Poor old Madam Swann.

164
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,605
I don't know why we bother
with fittings.

165
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,520
She always makes the same frock.
What do you want?

166
00:09:57,555 --> 00:10:00,400
Something new and exciting.
Heavens, look at the time!

167
00:10:00,435 --> 00:10:02,445
Not a minute to change.

168
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,120
And Granny's invited herself
for dinner.

169
00:10:05,155 --> 00:10:07,080
Then, she can jolly well wait.

170
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,080
So, women's rights begin at home?
I see.

171
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,360
Well, I'm all for that.

172
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,845
I'm just off, Mr Carson.

173
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,040
According to the wine book,
we should have six dozen of this.

174
00:10:36,075 --> 00:10:38,765
But I'm beggared
if I can find more than four.

175
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,920
Look again before you jump
to any nasty conclusions.

176
00:10:41,955 --> 00:10:43,965
Long time since you
last took a night off.

177
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,880
You don't think I ought to stay?
Certainly not. Be off with you.

178
00:10:47,915 --> 00:10:51,760
And Anna's in bed with a cold,
so I'm afraid it's all down to you.

179
00:10:51,795 --> 00:10:53,200
Go.

180
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,800
I wanted to have a go
before I went home.

181
00:11:04,835 --> 00:11:07,000
How about you?
Thank you.

182
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:12,480
Thank you. Is your father
doing anything this evening?

183
00:11:12,515 --> 00:11:14,877
He's not coming to the fair.
Seriously.

184
00:11:14,912 --> 00:11:17,240
We're having dinner with his family.

185
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,040
Could I look in afterwards?
May I ask why?

186
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,320
Your grandmother paid me a visit
this afternoon, and I'm...

187
00:11:27,355 --> 00:11:30,280
Well, never mind.
But I would like to see him.

188
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,645
Granny came to see you?

189
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,040
Is it all part of the great matter?

190
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,640
So, are you enjoying your new life?

191
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,165
Yes, I think so.

192
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,680
I know my work seems
very trivial to you.

193
00:11:53,715 --> 00:11:55,925
Not necessarily.

194
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:59,560
Sometimes I rather envy you, having
somewhere to go every morning.

195
00:11:59,595 --> 00:12:02,237
I thought that may have been
very 'middle-class.'

196
00:12:02,272 --> 00:12:04,880
You should learn to forget
what I say. I know I do.

197
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:09,160
How about you?
Is your life proving satisfactory?

198
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:11,160
Apart from the great matter,
of course.

199
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,960
Women like me don't have a life.

200
00:12:14,995 --> 00:12:17,445
We choose clothes and pick halls

201
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,285
and work for charity
and do the season.

202
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,840
But, really, we're stuck
in a waiting room until we marry.

203
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:28,680
I've made you angry.
My life makes me angry. Not you.

204
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,805
I never put the Sauternes on ice.

205
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,820
Mrs Hughes goes out for one night
and we all fall to pieces!

206
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:44,800
We wondered if we could walk
down to the fair. I suppose so.

207
00:12:44,835 --> 00:12:46,760
But don't be too late.

208
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:51,120
Where do you think she's gone?
None of your business.

209
00:12:51,155 --> 00:12:53,005
Like most of what goes on
round here.

210
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,560
Well caught that man -
though I say it myself.

211
00:12:55,595 --> 00:12:56,800
Thanks ever so.

212
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,320
Yes?

213
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,120
You've cheered up a bit.
He's so agile, in't he?

214
00:13:10,155 --> 00:13:12,760
He could have been a sportsman.
Who?

215
00:13:12,795 --> 00:13:16,125
Thomas, of course.
Really?

216
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,720
Which sport did he have in mind?

217
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,580
I ran into cousin Matthew
in the village.

218
00:13:23,615 --> 00:13:25,587
He wanted to call on you
after dinner.

219
00:13:25,622 --> 00:13:27,525
Apparently,
Granny's been to see him.

220
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:31,020
Did you tell him she's coming here?
I didn't know she was.

221
00:13:31,055 --> 00:13:34,480
When he arrives, do your best
to keep her in the drawing room.

222
00:13:34,515 --> 00:13:37,400
Well, I'd like to see YOU try.

223
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,365
Don't stay too long.
Let them have an early night.

224
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:05,400
Sybil, darling, why would you want
to go to a real school?

225
00:14:05,435 --> 00:14:07,165
You're not a doctor's daughter.

226
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,360
Nobody learns anything
from a governess.

227
00:14:09,395 --> 00:14:11,680
Apart from French and how to curtsy.

228
00:14:11,715 --> 00:14:13,480
What else do you need?

229
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,400
Well, there's - Are you thinking
of a career in banking?

230
00:14:18,435 --> 00:14:20,937
No. But it is a noble profession.

231
00:14:20,972 --> 00:14:23,546
Things are different in America.

232
00:14:23,581 --> 00:14:26,085
I know. They live in wigwams.

233
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,280
And when they come out of them,
they go to school.

234
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,400
If you wait in the library,
I'll tell Papa you're here.

235
00:14:38,435 --> 00:14:40,120
Thank you.

236
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,960
Elsie?

237
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,365
It is Elsie, isn't it?
It is.

238
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:15,200
Though there's very few left
to call me that, Joe Burns.

239
00:15:15,235 --> 00:15:17,800
Well, I'm flattered
that I'm one of them.

240
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,880
Where's Thomas? I let the servants
go down to the fair, milord.

241
00:15:24,915 --> 00:15:28,057
I didn't know we'd have
any visitors tonight.

242
00:15:28,092 --> 00:15:31,200
Well, that's all right.
They don't have much fun.

243
00:15:31,235 --> 00:15:34,000
You should join them.

244
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:39,165
So... what did you say to Mama?

245
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,540
I haven't spoken to her
since her visit,

246
00:15:41,575 --> 00:15:43,845
but I have looked through
every source,

247
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:47,040
and I can't find one reason
on which to base a challenge.

248
00:15:47,075 --> 00:15:49,000
I could have told you that.

249
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,045
I'm not quite sure how
to phrase it when I tell HER.

250
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:56,520
She shouldn't have put you on
the spot like that. It was unkind.

251
00:15:56,555 --> 00:15:59,960
I'm afraid she'll think I've failed
because I don't want to succeed.

252
00:15:59,995 --> 00:16:02,600
She will think that, but I don't.
And nor will Cora.

253
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,520
Of course, it's impossible for Mary.
She must resent me so bitterly.

254
00:16:07,555 --> 00:16:09,480
I don't blame her.

255
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,880
Yes, it must have been hard
for you when Ivy died.

256
00:16:13,915 --> 00:16:16,005
It took some getting used to.

257
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,605
What about your son?
Do you see much of him?

258
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:22,960
Peter? No. I would have given him
a share of the farm if he wanted it,

259
00:16:22,995 --> 00:16:26,285
but he's joined the army.
Well, I never!

260
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,920
Aye, he seems happy.
But it's left me on my own.

261
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,120
Shall I take your plates, then?
Thank you.

262
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,765
So, how's life treated you?
Oh, I can't complain.

263
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:45,640
I haven't travelled. But I've seen
a bit of life, and no mistake.

264
00:16:45,675 --> 00:16:49,525
I notice you call yourself missus.

265
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,525
Housekeepers and cooks
are always missus.

266
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,885
You know better than anyone
I haven't changed my name.

267
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:00,600
Well, I know you wouldn't change it
to Burns when you had the chance.

268
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,485
You shouldn't have eaten with us.

269
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,965
The chauffeur always eats
in his own cottage.

270
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,720
Steady on. You can cut him a bit
of slack on his SECOND day.

271
00:17:11,755 --> 00:17:13,840
I'm waiting to take old
Lady Grantham home.

272
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:15,605
Even then,
Taylor never ate with us.

273
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,960
You're taking advantage
of Mrs Hughes' absence.

274
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,880
What are you doing?
I'm sorting the collars.

275
00:17:23,915 --> 00:17:26,537
Removing the ones
that have come to an end.

276
00:17:26,572 --> 00:17:29,125
What happens to his lordship's
old clothes?

277
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,120
What's it to you? Clothes are
a valet's perk, not a chauffeur's.

278
00:17:32,155 --> 00:17:35,600
I get some, but mostly it goes
into the missionary barrel.

279
00:17:35,635 --> 00:17:37,365
I know it's meant
to be kind,

280
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,800
but I can think of better
ways of helping the needy

281
00:17:39,835 --> 00:17:41,800
than sending stiff collars
to the equator.

282
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:48,100
I thought Anna might have come down
for her dinner.

283
00:17:48,135 --> 00:17:51,120
And show she's ready to start
work again? Not a chance.

284
00:17:51,155 --> 00:17:53,845
Is she still in bed, then?
She is.

285
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,840
While I'm sat here sewing like
a cursed princess in a fairy tale,

286
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,600
and not down at the fair
with the others.

287
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,860
Would you like me to ask Branson
to bring the car round, milady?

288
00:18:04,895 --> 00:18:08,287
Where's Robert? He can't have been
drinking port since we left.

289
00:18:08,322 --> 00:18:11,680
He'd be under the table by now.
His lordship's in the library.

290
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:14,645
All alone? Oh, how sad.

291
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,760
No, he's - We can say goodbye
to Papa for you, Granny.

292
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,960
He's what?

293
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,320
He's with Mr Crawley, milady.

294
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,360
The question is, what do I say
to cousin Violet?

295
00:18:31,395 --> 00:18:33,920
Don't worry about that.
I can handle her.

296
00:18:33,955 --> 00:18:35,205
Really?

297
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:38,880
Well, if you can, you must have
learned to very recently.

298
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,840
Anna?
Mr Bates?

299
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,240
Can you open the door?

300
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,880
I daren't.

301
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:17,140
No-one can open that door
except Mrs Hughes.

302
00:19:17,175 --> 00:19:19,600
Just for a moment.
I've brought you something.

303
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,520
I don't know what -
Ssh.

304
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,925
What I don't understand
in all this is you.

305
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,120
You seem positively glad
to see Mary disinherited.

306
00:20:14,155 --> 00:20:16,480
You speak as if we had a choice.

307
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:18,440
Thank you, Branson.

308
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:30,080
I'm worn out. Tell Lady Mary
and Mr Crawley I've gone to bed.

309
00:20:30,115 --> 00:20:32,080
Shall I tell them NOW, milord?

310
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,360
No. Wait until they ring.

311
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,845
I like this one.

312
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,965
Yes, sir?
I ought to start back.

313
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,485
This is very late for me.
Aw, not yet.

314
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,480
It's a long time since I've had
a girl to show off for at the fair.

315
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:56,360
So, I take it you never get lonely?

316
00:20:56,395 --> 00:20:59,125
Well, that's working in a big house.

317
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:02,880
Though, there are times when
you yearn for a bit of solitude.

318
00:21:02,915 --> 00:21:05,480
Oh!
We have a winner!

319
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,085
Ah, thank you.

320
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,040
Right, well, er...
something to remind you of me.

321
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:16,960
I don't need help to remember you.

322
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:23,205
But what happens when you retire?

323
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,125
I should think if I stay here
they'll look after me.

324
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:29,820
Suppose they sell the estate.
Suppose there's a tidal wave.

325
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:33,480
Suppose we all die of the plague.
Suppose there's a war.

326
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,045
What did I tell you?
She's found her Romeo.

327
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,720
He might be her brother.
She hasn't got one, or we'd know.

328
00:21:41,755 --> 00:21:43,917
Just a sister in Lytham St Anne's.

329
00:21:43,952 --> 00:21:46,080
You know everything, don't you?

330
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,925
Everything my foot!

331
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:53,260
You're hiding behind him,
but he's not what you think he is.

332
00:21:53,295 --> 00:21:56,560
Oh, go home, William. If you're
gonna be such a spoilsport...

333
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,085
All right, I will.

334
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,600
Come back. She didn't mean it.

335
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:11,720
I must go. But it's been lovely
to see you again, Joe.

336
00:22:11,755 --> 00:22:15,240
Really.
And you know what I'm asking?

337
00:22:15,275 --> 00:22:17,965
You haven't asked anything yet.

338
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,600
But you know what it is?
When I do.

339
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,920
I'm going to stop here at the pub
until I hear from you.

340
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,325
Oh, and take your time.

341
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:32,280
I'd rather wait a week
for the right answer, then...

342
00:22:32,315 --> 00:22:34,280
get a wrong one in a hurry.

343
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:39,220
Think about it carefully.

344
00:22:39,255 --> 00:22:42,000
I will. I promise you that.

345
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,340
To break the entail, we'd need
a private bill in Parliament?

346
00:23:00,375 --> 00:23:03,480
Even then, it would only be passed
if the estate were in danger,

347
00:23:03,515 --> 00:23:07,320
which it's not.
And I mean nothing in all this?

348
00:23:07,355 --> 00:23:09,520
On the contrary,
you mean a great deal.

349
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:12,240
A very great deal.

350
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,845
You rang, milady?
Yes, Carson.

351
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,000
Mr Crawley was just leaving.
Do you know where his lordship is?

352
00:23:22,035 --> 00:23:23,965
Gone to bed, milady.

353
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,720
He felt tired after he put
Lady Grantham into the car.

354
00:23:26,755 --> 00:23:29,720
I bet he did. Thank you, Carson.

355
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,880
I'm sorry. I wish I could think
of something to say that would help.

356
00:23:38,915 --> 00:23:41,520
There's nothing.
But you mustn't let it trouble you.

357
00:23:41,555 --> 00:23:43,525
It does trouble me.

358
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,800
It troubles me very much.

359
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,720
Then, that will be
my consolation prize.

360
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,800
Good night, cousin Matthew.

361
00:23:52,835 --> 00:23:54,880
Good night.

362
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,925
I hope I haven't kept you up
too late?

363
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,325
I'm afraid we've interfered
with your dinner.

364
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:17,600
It's been rather a chop-and-change
evening downstairs.

365
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,485
Lady Grantham got off all right?

366
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:24,160
'All right' is an optimistic
assessment, sir.

367
00:24:24,195 --> 00:24:26,640
It's very difficult, Carson.

368
00:24:26,675 --> 00:24:29,125
For her, for Lady Mary.

369
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:32,440
For everyone.
It is, Mr Crawley.

370
00:24:32,475 --> 00:24:35,720
But I appreciate your saying so.

371
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:02,320
Well, that's her greatness done
and dusted for the night.

372
00:25:02,355 --> 00:25:04,720
Will, have you had a good night?

373
00:25:04,755 --> 00:25:07,000
I'm off to bed.
Wait.

374
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,840
What happened?
Nothing. Doesn't matter.

375
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,080
How was your evening, Mrs Hughes?

376
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,525
Very enjoyable, thank you.

377
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:22,760
The others are just behind me,
so you can lock up in a minute.

378
00:25:22,795 --> 00:25:25,125
Well, I'll say goodnight.

379
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,485
Goodnight, Mrs Hughes.
Good night.

380
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,005
Night, Mrs Hughes.

381
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:32,000
Good night, Mrs Hughes.

382
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:37,040
I was right when I said
she was looking sparkly eyed.

383
00:25:37,075 --> 00:25:39,760
I beg your pardon, Thomas?

384
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:46,280
He can disapprove all he likes.
Mrs Hughes has got a fancy man.

385
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,640
Him, a fancy man? Don't be so
nasty, Daisy. It doesn't suit you.

386
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,740
I reckon there's a job vacancy
coming up.

387
00:25:56,775 --> 00:25:58,845
Miss O'Brian,
do you fancy a promotion?

388
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,120
Huh, very droll.
If she's got a boyfriend...

389
00:26:02,155 --> 00:26:04,080
I'm a giraffe.

390
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,920
Leave me alone, Mr Bates.

391
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,040
I know you mean well, but let me be.

392
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,680
What chance did he have
up against a champion?

393
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,560
Well, you listen.
You filthy little rat.

394
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:47,080
If you don't lay off,
I will punch your shining teeth

395
00:26:47,115 --> 00:26:49,040
through the back of your skull.

396
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,120
Is this supposed to frighten me,
Mr Bates?

397
00:26:53,155 --> 00:26:55,560
Because if it is, it isn't working.

398
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,280
I'm sorry,
but it's just not working.

399
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,965
Daisy? Chafing dishes now.

400
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,160
Right in front of you, Mrs Patmore.
Are you trying to trick me?

401
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:50,200
Anna's still not well. O'Brien, you'll
need to dress the girls this morning.

402
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:55,040
All we know about Lady Mary, and here
I am waiting on her hand and foot!

403
00:27:55,075 --> 00:27:57,880
Will we do anything with that?
Maybe, but not yet.

404
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,885
What do you look like?

405
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,680
Daisy, what do you think
he looks like?

406
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,660
Do your buttons up.

407
00:28:13,695 --> 00:28:16,160
Well, go on, then.

408
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,280
What do you want?
I've got a message for Lady Sybil.

409
00:28:50,315 --> 00:28:52,285
From her ladyship.

410
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,280
Thank you, O'Brien. I'll manage now.

411
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,820
Odious woman. What does Mama want?

412
00:29:04,855 --> 00:29:08,040
I just said that to get rid of her.

413
00:29:08,075 --> 00:29:10,000
This came today.

414
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:22,520
I knew they would want to see you.
It's your reference what's done it.

415
00:29:22,555 --> 00:29:25,600
How am I going to get there?
They won't let me take a day off.

416
00:29:25,635 --> 00:29:27,925
You're going to be ill.

417
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,240
They can't stop you being ill.
What?

418
00:29:30,275 --> 00:29:32,485
No-one has seen Anna
for a whole day.

419
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:36,400
They won't notice if you vanish
for a couple of hours.

420
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:42,560
The only one who never sticks up
for me in all this is you.

421
00:29:42,595 --> 00:29:46,680
Why is that? You are my darling
daughter, and I love you.

422
00:29:46,715 --> 00:29:49,365
Hard as it is for an Englishman
to say the words.

423
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:54,360
Well, then. If I had made my own
fortune and bought Downton myself,

424
00:29:54,395 --> 00:29:56,840
it should be yours without question.

425
00:29:56,875 --> 00:29:58,885
But I did not.

426
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:01,365
My fortune is the work of others

427
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:04,480
who laboured to build
a great dynasty.

428
00:30:04,515 --> 00:30:07,560
Do I have the right
to destroy their work?

429
00:30:07,595 --> 00:30:10,520
Or impoverish that dynasty?

430
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,640
I am a custodian,
my dear, not an owner.

431
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:21,040
I must strive to be worthy
of the task I've been set.

432
00:30:21,075 --> 00:30:23,877
If I could take Mama's money
out of the estate,

433
00:30:23,912 --> 00:30:26,680
Downton would have to be sold
to pay for it.

434
00:30:26,715 --> 00:30:28,725
Is that what you want?

435
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:32,640
To see Matthew a landless peer with
a title but no means to pay for it?

436
00:30:32,675 --> 00:30:35,400
So, I'm just to find a husband
and get out of the way?

437
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,640
You could stay here
if you married Matthew.

438
00:30:38,675 --> 00:30:41,445
You know my character, Father.

439
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:44,360
I'd never marry any man
that I was told to.

440
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:48,960
I'm stubborn.
I wish I wasn't, but I am.

441
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,920
Will you have your own way,
do you think? With the frock.

442
00:31:10,955 --> 00:31:14,040
Only I couldn't help overhearing
yesterday.

443
00:31:14,075 --> 00:31:16,245
And from what her ladyship said,

444
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,800
it sounded as if you support
women's rights.

445
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:20,805
I suppose I do.

446
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:23,645
Because I'm quite political.

447
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:26,880
In fact, I brought some pamphlets
that I thought might interest you.

448
00:31:26,915 --> 00:31:28,920
About the vote.

449
00:31:28,955 --> 00:31:30,880
Thank you.

450
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:35,500
But please don't mention this
to my father. Or my grandmother.

451
00:31:35,535 --> 00:31:39,240
One whiff of reform, and she hears
the rattle of the guillotine.

452
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:43,800
It seems rather unlikely,
a revolutionary chauffeur.

453
00:31:43,835 --> 00:31:45,845
Maybe.

454
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:48,240
But I'm a socialist,
not a revolutionary.

455
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,360
And I won't always be a chauffeur.

456
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,205
Mrs Crawley. How nice.

457
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:01,880
You're busy. We can come back later.
Molesley?

458
00:32:01,915 --> 00:32:04,717
What are you doing here?
Are you ill?

459
00:32:04,752 --> 00:32:07,485
Poor old Mr Molesley.
How's it going?

460
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,760
The solution doesn't seem
to make it any better.

461
00:32:09,795 --> 00:32:12,285
My imagination's running riot.

462
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:16,040
I've got erysipelas, your ladyship.

463
00:32:16,075 --> 00:32:18,085
Oh, I am sorry.

464
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:21,920
Mrs Crawley tells me she's recommended
nitrate of silver and tincture of steel.

465
00:32:21,955 --> 00:32:25,045
Why, is she making a suit
of armour?

466
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,640
But I take it there's been
no improvement?

467
00:32:27,675 --> 00:32:29,725
Not really.

468
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,440
And you're sure it's erysipelas?

469
00:32:32,475 --> 00:32:35,085
That is Mrs Crawley's diagnosis.

470
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,280
What it is to have
medical knowledge.

471
00:32:38,315 --> 00:32:41,000
It has its uses.
Mm.

472
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:45,200
I see your father has been making
changes at home.

473
00:32:45,235 --> 00:32:47,800
He has, milady.
He's got no use for the herb garden

474
00:32:47,835 --> 00:32:49,565
now my mother's gone.

475
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,400
And you've been helping him?
I have.

476
00:32:52,435 --> 00:32:55,440
Grubbing out the old rue hedge?

477
00:32:55,475 --> 00:32:57,645
How did you know that?

478
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,720
Because this is not erysipelas.

479
00:32:59,755 --> 00:33:02,205
This is a rue allergy.

480
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,240
If Molesley wears gardening gloves,
it'll be gone in a week.

481
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:11,260
Please don't think we're ungrateful
for your enthusiasm, Mrs Crawley,

482
00:33:11,295 --> 00:33:15,280
but there comes a time when things
are best left to the professionals.

483
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:18,960
But I -
And now I really, I really must go.

484
00:33:18,995 --> 00:33:20,965
Good day.

485
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,880
Thank you, your ladyship.

486
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,180
I hope cousin Violet has
recovered from last night.

487
00:33:39,215 --> 00:33:41,725
Whatever she says,
my mother is as strong as an ox.

488
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,720
It's high time she let go of her
scheme for upsetting everything.

489
00:33:44,755 --> 00:33:47,800
Time we all did.
I can't deny I'm pleased to hear it.

490
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:52,285
Are you beginning to see
a future here, then?

491
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,600
In a way, this business
has forced me to recognise

492
00:33:54,635 --> 00:33:56,600
that I do want Downton
to be my future.

493
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:02,005
I'm glad. You must have thought me
an awful prig when I first arrived.

494
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:06,280
Not a prig, just a man thrust into
something he never wanted or envisaged.

495
00:34:06,315 --> 00:34:09,497
I could only see the absurdity
of the whole thing. I'm sorry.

496
00:34:09,532 --> 00:34:12,680
Well, there are absurdities involved,
as I know well enough.

497
00:34:12,715 --> 00:34:15,757
Possibilities, too.
And I was blind to them.

498
00:34:15,792 --> 00:34:18,336
I was determined
not to let it change me.

499
00:34:18,371 --> 00:34:20,845
It was absurd.
If you don't change, you die.

500
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:24,020
Do you think so? I'm not sure.
Sometimes I think I hate change.

501
00:34:24,055 --> 00:34:27,160
At least we can comfort ourselves
that this will still be here.

502
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,600
Because we saved it.

503
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:38,840
Thomas is lovely, in't he?
He's funny and handsome.

504
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:43,920
He's got such lovely teeth.
He's not for you, Daisy.

505
00:34:43,955 --> 00:34:46,120
Course not. He's too good for me.
I know that.

506
00:34:46,155 --> 00:34:48,365
No! He's not too GOOD.

507
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:52,640
What, then?
He's not the boy for you,

508
00:34:52,675 --> 00:34:54,720
and you're not the girl for him.

509
00:34:54,755 --> 00:34:56,760
In't that what I just said?

510
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:03,560
And why would he be,
when he's seen and done so much,

511
00:35:03,595 --> 00:35:05,965
and I've been nowhere
and done nothing?

512
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,840
Perhaps, Thomas has seen and done
more than is good for him.

513
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:14,165
He's not a lady's man.

514
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:17,800
Well, in't it a blessed relief?
Daisy!

515
00:35:17,835 --> 00:35:20,760
Thomas is a troubled soul.

516
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:24,240
I don't know what you mean,
Mrs Patmore.

517
00:35:24,275 --> 00:35:25,925
Oh.

518
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,965
Nothing.

519
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,885
I don't mean anything.

520
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,960
Except, if I don't get
the ice cream started,

521
00:35:31,995 --> 00:35:34,000
they'll be dining at midnight.

522
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,165
Golly, my corset's tight.

523
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:45,200
Anna, when you've done that,
be an angel and loosen it a bit.

524
00:35:45,235 --> 00:35:47,440
Mm.
The start of the slippery slope.

525
00:35:47,475 --> 00:35:49,377
I'm not putting on weight.

526
00:35:49,412 --> 00:35:51,280
It didn't shrink in the draw.

527
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,525
Are you coming down? I don't know
why we bother with corsets.

528
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:58,760
Men don't wear them, and they look
perfectly normal in their clothes.

529
00:35:58,795 --> 00:36:01,357
Not all of them.
She's just showing off.

530
00:36:01,392 --> 00:36:03,885
She'll be on about the vote
in a minute.

531
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,800
If you mean do I think women should
have the vote, of course I do.

532
00:36:06,835 --> 00:36:09,120
I hope you won't chain yourself
to the railings,

533
00:36:09,155 --> 00:36:11,040
and end up being force-fed semolina.

534
00:36:11,075 --> 00:36:13,245
What do you think, Anna?

535
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,160
I think those women are very brave.
Hear-hear.

536
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,840
How did you get on
with your dressmaker?

537
00:36:20,875 --> 00:36:23,405
Find anything?
I did.

538
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,805
And she says she can
have it done by Friday.

539
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:28,840
I'm sorry I couldn't come,
but I didn't want to put Matthew off.

540
00:36:28,875 --> 00:36:31,457
Were you pleased with
the work on the cottages?

541
00:36:31,492 --> 00:36:34,040
I think they're making
a very good job of them.

542
00:36:34,075 --> 00:36:35,845
You must all go and see.

543
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,880
You'll restore a few
every year?

544
00:36:37,915 --> 00:36:39,965
It was Matthew's idea.

545
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Old crips was rather reluctant,
but I'm pleased we went forward.

546
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:46,557
I suppose it's worth it.
Of course it is.

547
00:36:46,592 --> 00:36:49,045
Because of the people
who will live in them.

548
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:52,260
Matthew's conscience is much more
energetic than mine.

549
00:36:52,295 --> 00:36:55,440
Excuse me, I'm going to bed.
I've rather a headache.

550
00:36:55,475 --> 00:36:58,897
Of course. Should I bring you
something for it?

551
00:36:58,932 --> 00:37:02,320
No, I'll be perfectly fine.
If I can just lie down.

552
00:37:02,355 --> 00:37:04,280
Mary.

553
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,000
Oh, my darling.

554
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,760
What is it?

555
00:37:15,795 --> 00:37:17,965
You heard him,

556
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,800
'Matthew this, Matthew that,
Matthew, Matthew, Matthew!'

557
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:26,685
Oh, Mother, don't you see?

558
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,720
He has a son now. Of course
he didn't argue with the entail.

559
00:37:29,755 --> 00:37:32,720
Why would he when he's got what
he always wanted?

560
00:37:32,755 --> 00:37:35,137
Your father loves you very much.

561
00:37:35,172 --> 00:37:37,766
He wouldn't fight for me, though.

562
00:37:37,801 --> 00:37:40,360
Because he knew he couldn't win.

563
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:45,405
You're no better.
What?

564
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,540
You don't care that
Matthew gets everything,

565
00:37:47,575 --> 00:37:49,605
because you don't think
I'm worthy. Mary!

566
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:53,080
I wish you'd just admit it.
I'm a lost soul to you.

567
00:37:53,115 --> 00:37:56,520
I took lover with no thought
of marriage - a Turk!

568
00:37:56,555 --> 00:38:00,360
Oh, think of that! Oh, my dear!

569
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,140
Don't worry, Mama.

570
00:38:08,175 --> 00:38:10,165
You can go down now.

571
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,800
Everything will look better
in the morning.

572
00:38:12,835 --> 00:38:14,440
Isn't that what you usually say?

573
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:19,000
I say it because it's usually true.

574
00:38:19,035 --> 00:38:21,640
Papa will wonder where you are.

575
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:33,400
Don't quarrel with Matthew.
Why shouldn't I?

576
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,440
Because one day you may need him.

577
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,765
Oh, I see.

578
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:45,640
When I've ruined myself, I must have
a powerful protector to hide behind.

579
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:21,040
I'd tell you off...

580
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,160
..but I like to hear you play.

581
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:29,880
Where are they all?
Busy, I suppose.

582
00:39:29,915 --> 00:39:32,720
Haven't you got anything to do?

583
00:39:32,755 --> 00:39:34,680
Yes, I have.

584
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,080
Of course I have.

585
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:43,520
You mustn't let Thomas get you down.
He's just jealous.

586
00:39:43,555 --> 00:39:46,645
Everyone likes you better than him.

587
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:50,760
Not everyone. Then, she's a foolish
girl, and she doesn't deserve you.

588
00:39:50,795 --> 00:39:52,805
Though, why am I encouraging you?

589
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:56,760
Forget all that for 10 years
at least.

590
00:39:56,795 --> 00:39:59,085
You're a kind woman, Mrs Hughes.

591
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:02,200
I don't know how this house
would run without you.

592
00:40:02,235 --> 00:40:04,045
I don't, truly.

593
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:06,740
Stopped flannelling and get on.

594
00:40:06,775 --> 00:40:09,400
Before I betray you to Mr Carson.

595
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:45,840
Is there anything more thrilling
than a new frock?

596
00:40:45,875 --> 00:40:48,000
I suppose not, milady.

597
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,040
You shall have one, too.

598
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,760
I thought this would be suitable
for your interview.

599
00:40:54,795 --> 00:40:57,325
I won't be wearing it, milady.
Of course you will.

600
00:40:57,360 --> 00:41:00,920
We have to make you look like
a successful, professional woman.

601
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,360
What is it? What's happened?

602
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:09,520
Well, I won't wear it
because I'm not going.

603
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:13,245
They've cancelled the appointment.

604
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:17,160
They found someone more
'suited for the post.'

605
00:41:17,195 --> 00:41:19,800
And better qualified.
This time.

606
00:41:19,835 --> 00:41:21,885
Let's face it.

607
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:25,600
There will never be anyone less suited
for the post or worse qualified than I am.

608
00:41:25,635 --> 00:41:27,600
That isn't true.

609
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,525
You'll see. We're not giving up.

610
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:34,520
No-one hits the bull's-eye
with the first arrow.

611
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,040
I've put out the Rundle
candlesticks for dinner tonight.

612
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:49,240
Oh. I'm sorry.
I'll come back later.

613
00:41:49,275 --> 00:41:51,125
No, stay. Please.

614
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:54,080
I've got something
I'd like to talk to you about.

615
00:41:54,115 --> 00:41:56,040
If you've a minute.

616
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,840
Before I first came here
as head housemaid,

617
00:42:07,875 --> 00:42:10,000
I was walking out with a farmer.

618
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:16,640
When I told him I'd taken a job
at Downton, he asked me to marry him.

619
00:42:16,675 --> 00:42:19,960
I was a farmer's daughter from
Argyll, so I knew the life.

620
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:23,405
He was very nice.

621
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,245
But then I came here,
and I did well,

622
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:30,520
and I didn't want to give it up,
so I told him no...

623
00:42:30,555 --> 00:42:32,997
and he married someone else.

624
00:42:33,032 --> 00:42:35,405
She died three years ago,

625
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:39,440
and last month he wrote
asking to see me again.

626
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:45,160
And I agreed, because all this time
I've wondered.

627
00:42:45,195 --> 00:42:47,120
Go on.

628
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,840
I met him the other night.

629
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:54,040
We had dinner at the Grantham Arms,
and after, he took me to the fair.

630
00:42:54,075 --> 00:42:56,925
And he was horrible
and fat and red-faced,

631
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:00,160
and you couldn't think
what you ever saw in him?

632
00:43:00,195 --> 00:43:02,537
He was still a nice man.

633
00:43:02,572 --> 00:43:04,845
He IS still a nice man.

634
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:09,960
Well, he was a bit red-faced,
and his suit was a little tight,

635
00:43:09,995 --> 00:43:11,805
but none of that matters.

636
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:15,200
In the real ways, he hadn't changed.

637
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:19,240
And he proposed again...

638
00:43:19,275 --> 00:43:21,840
and you accepted?

639
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:34,560
In many ways, I wanted to accept.

640
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:39,320
But I'm not that farm girl any more.

641
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:44,120
I was flattered, of course, but...

642
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:49,240
..I've changed, Mr Carson.

643
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:53,560
Life's altered you,
as it's altered me.

644
00:43:53,595 --> 00:43:56,240
And what would be
the point of living

645
00:43:56,275 --> 00:43:58,160
if we didn't let life change us?

646
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:04,280
You won't be leaving, then?

647
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:11,360
You'd better come.
Mrs Patmore's on the rampage.

648
00:44:11,395 --> 00:44:13,205
She wants the key
to the store cupboard.

649
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:15,800
You know how angry she gets
she hasn't got one.

650
00:44:15,835 --> 00:44:18,360
Nor will she have, not while
I'm housekeeper here.

651
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:23,005
Leaving? When would I
ever find the time?

652
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:26,880
..I have to go
cap in hand to Mary Queen of Scots!

653
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:34,445
Whatever is holding Sybil up?

654
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:36,760
She was going on about her new frock.

655
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:48,280
We'd better go in without her,
or it's not fair on Mrs Patmore.

656
00:44:48,315 --> 00:44:51,160
Oh, is her cooking
so precisely timed?

657
00:44:51,195 --> 00:44:53,560
You couldn't tell.

658
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:00,400
I think her food is delicious.

659
00:45:00,435 --> 00:45:02,640
Naturally.

660
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:22,040
Good evening, everyone.

661
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:42,845
Why should you be burdened
with Mary's secret?

662
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:46,360
There's a rumour in London
that you are not virtuous.

663
00:45:46,395 --> 00:45:48,560
I wish you'd just come out with it.
With what?

664
00:45:48,595 --> 00:45:50,925
Whatever it is you're
keeping secret.

665
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:53,420
Isn't it possible I should win
the thing on merit?

666
00:45:53,455 --> 00:45:55,767
The appropriate answer
to that is: 'Yes, dear.'

667
00:45:55,802 --> 00:45:58,080
Maybe I'll shine by comparison.
Maybe you will.

668
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:06,000
