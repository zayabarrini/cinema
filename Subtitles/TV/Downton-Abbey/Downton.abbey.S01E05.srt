1
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,885
You made me jump.

2
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,880
Daisy, what is the matter with you?
You're all thumbs.

3
00:00:48,915 --> 00:00:51,357
Sorry. I hate this room.
Why?

4
00:00:51,392 --> 00:00:53,800
What's the matter with it?

5
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,840
Daisy?

6
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:29,000
Who's that from, Papa?
You seem very absorbed.

7
00:01:29,035 --> 00:01:31,600
Your Aunt Rosamond.
Anything interesting?

8
00:01:31,635 --> 00:01:33,845
Nothing to trouble you with.

9
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,560
Poor Aunt Rosamond.
All alone in that big house.

10
00:01:36,595 --> 00:01:38,725
I feel so sorry for her.
I don't.

11
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:42,160
All alone, with plenty of money,
in a house in Eaton Square?

12
00:01:42,195 --> 00:01:44,325
I can't imagine anything better.

13
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,805
Really, Mary, I wish
you wouldn't talk like that.

14
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,200
There will come a day when someone
thinks you mean what you say.

15
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:53,097
It can't come soon enough for me.

16
00:01:53,132 --> 00:01:55,925
Carson, I'll be in the library.

17
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,045
Will you let me know
when Her Ladyship is down?

18
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,360
Certainly, milord. Sybil, darling,
this one's for you.

19
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,440
I saw another opening for
a secretary and I applied.

20
00:02:09,475 --> 00:02:11,325
But you never said.

21
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,120
I didn't want you
to be disappointed.

22
00:02:13,155 --> 00:02:14,925
I thought you'd given up.

23
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,200
I'll never give up and nor will you.

24
00:02:17,235 --> 00:02:19,277
Things are changing for women.

25
00:02:19,312 --> 00:02:21,716
Not just the vote, but our lives.

26
00:02:21,751 --> 00:02:24,085
But it's tomorrow! At ten o clock.

27
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,600
Last time we waited for weeks
and weeks, and this one's tomorrow!

28
00:02:27,635 --> 00:02:30,240
Then we must be ready by tomorrow,
mustn't we?

29
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,245
I thought I'd write to Edith

30
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,845
to settle our promised church visit.
If you want.

31
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:40,160
We can't throw her over, when she
made such effort for the last one.

32
00:02:40,195 --> 00:02:42,417
It's all in your head.
I don't think so.

33
00:02:42,452 --> 00:02:44,605
Then she's barking
up the wrong tree.

34
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,165
Poor Edith. I hope there's
a right tree for her somewhere.

35
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,200
Ma'am, I was wondering if I might
take some time this afternoon

36
00:02:50,235 --> 00:02:52,125
to help in the village hall.

37
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,280
Why? What's happening? It's the
flower show, sir, next Saturday.

38
00:02:55,315 --> 00:02:58,400
I'll give my father a hand with
his stall, if I may. You must go.

39
00:02:58,435 --> 00:03:01,040
And so, I'm afraid, must I.

40
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,285
Is Mr Carson about?

41
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,760
I don't think so.
I was just looking for him, myself.

42
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,365
Busy?

43
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,000
I'm just trying to sort out
the wretched flower show.

44
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,845
I've had a letter from Rosamond.
Don't tell me:

45
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:39,160
she wants saddle of lamb and all the
fruit and vegetables we can muster.

46
00:03:39,195 --> 00:03:42,077
She enjoys a taste of her old home.

47
00:03:42,112 --> 00:03:44,960
She enjoys not paying for food.

48
00:03:44,995 --> 00:03:46,885
There's something else.

49
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,800
Apparently, the word is going round
London that Evelyn Napier

50
00:03:49,835 --> 00:03:51,725
has given up any thought of Mary.

51
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,580
That he's going to marry
one of the Semphill girls.

52
00:03:54,615 --> 00:03:58,427
She writes as if, somehow,
it reflects badly on Mary.

53
00:03:58,462 --> 00:04:02,240
Your dear sister is always
such a harbinger of joy. No...

54
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:04,685
as if...

55
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,520
as if Mary had somehow been found
wanting in her character.

56
00:04:08,555 --> 00:04:11,277
Well, I don't believe Mr Napier
would have said that.

57
00:04:11,312 --> 00:04:14,000
Neither do I, really, but -
She ought to be married.

58
00:04:14,035 --> 00:04:16,205
Talk to her.

59
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,845
She never listens to me.

60
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,040
If she did, she'd marry Matthew.

61
00:04:20,075 --> 00:04:22,165
What about Anthony Strallan?

62
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:26,165
Anthony Strallan is at least my age
and as dull as paint.

63
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,520
I doubt she'd want to sit next to
him at dinner, let alone marry him.

64
00:04:29,555 --> 00:04:31,645
She has to marry someone, Robert.

65
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,440
And if this is what's being said
in London, she has to marry soon.

66
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,005
You shouldn't do that in here.

67
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,445
I don't like being in the pantry
all alone.

68
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,720
Mr Carson won't mind.
He's gone into the village.

69
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:50,885
He'll mind if I tell him.

70
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,140
That's pretty.
Do you think so?

71
00:04:53,175 --> 00:04:55,325
She wants it put onto a new shirt,

72
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,880
but it's a bit old-fashioned
to my taste. Oh, no, it's lovely.

73
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,160
Have you recovered, Daisy?

74
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,800
What from?
She had a bit of a turn.

75
00:05:05,835 --> 00:05:07,965
When we were in Lady Mary's room.

76
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,245
I'm fine, thank you.
What sort of a turn?

77
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,800
Did you see a ghost? Leave her, if
she doesn't want to talk about it.

78
00:05:14,835 --> 00:05:18,080
I've often wondered if this place
is haunted. It ought to be.

79
00:05:18,115 --> 00:05:21,080
By the spirits of maids and footmen
who died in slavery?

80
00:05:21,115 --> 00:05:23,000
But not, in Thomas's case,
from over work.

81
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,880
Come on, Daisy. What was it?

82
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,045
I don't know. I was thinking...

83
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,960
first we had the Titanic -
Don't keep harping back to that.

84
00:05:40,995 --> 00:05:43,497
I know it was a while ago,
but we knew 'em.

85
00:05:43,532 --> 00:05:45,965
I think of how I laid the fires
for Mr Patrick,

86
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
but he drowned in them icy waters.
Oh, for God's sake.

87
00:05:50,035 --> 00:05:52,085
And then there's the Turkish
gentleman.

88
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,720
It just seems there's been
too much death in the house.

89
00:05:54,755 --> 00:05:57,840
What's that got to do
with Lady Mary's bedroom?

90
00:05:57,875 --> 00:06:00,800
Nothing. Nothing at all.

91
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,805
Afternoon, ma'am.

92
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,000
When do you put that magnificent
display of prizes on show?

93
00:06:18,035 --> 00:06:19,725
Not till the day itself.

94
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,965
I remember a superb cup
from last year.

95
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,960
The Grantham Cup. It was donated
by the late Lord Grantham.

96
00:06:24,995 --> 00:06:27,760
For the Best Bloom In The Village.
And who won it?

97
00:06:27,795 --> 00:06:29,360
I did.

98
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,280
Well done.

99
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,205
And the year before?

100
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,400
Her Ladyship won that one, too.

101
00:06:38,435 --> 00:06:41,320
Heavens, how thrilling.

102
00:06:41,355 --> 00:06:43,205
And before that?

103
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,360
You've met my father.

104
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,960
Good afternoon, Mr Molesley.
What are you showing this year?

105
00:06:49,995 --> 00:06:52,365
Oh, this and that.

106
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,400
Only the finest roses in the
village. Really?

107
00:06:55,435 --> 00:06:57,125
What an achievement.

108
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,760
It's a wonderful area for roses.

109
00:06:59,795 --> 00:07:01,765
We're very lucky.

110
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,960
We'll see some beautiful examples
across the show.

111
00:07:03,995 --> 00:07:05,645
Won't we, Mr Molesley?

112
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,320
If you say so, Your Ladyship.

113
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,120
What's up with you?

114
00:07:24,155 --> 00:07:26,085
Nothing.

115
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,600
His Lordship blames Mr Napier for
spreading gossip about Lady Mary,

116
00:07:29,635 --> 00:07:32,560
but it was you, wasn't it?
Why do you say that?

117
00:07:32,595 --> 00:07:34,485
Because Napier wasn't in on it.

118
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,600
Only four people know
he was in her room that night.

119
00:07:37,635 --> 00:07:39,697
You, me, Lady Mary
and possibly Daisy.

120
00:07:39,732 --> 00:07:41,686
And I haven't said nothing
to nobody.

121
00:07:41,721 --> 00:07:43,605
I didn't tell about Pamuk.
I just wrote

122
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,765
that Lady Mary was no better
than she ought to be.

123
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,800
Who did you write it to? A friend
of mine. Valet to Lord Savident.

124
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:50,725
You know what they say
about old Savident.

125
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,800
Not so much an open mind as an open
mouth. No wonder it's round London.

126
00:07:53,835 --> 00:07:56,720
You won't tell, will you?
I'm in enough trouble as it is.

127
00:07:56,755 --> 00:07:58,605
Why? What's happened?

128
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,520
Mr Bates saw me nicking
a bottle of wine.

129
00:08:00,555 --> 00:08:02,445
Has he told Mr Carson?
Not yet.

130
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,445
But he will
when he's feeling spiteful.

131
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,080
I wish we could be shot of him.
Then think of something quick.

132
00:08:07,115 --> 00:08:09,680
Turn the tables on him, before
he has the chance to nail you.

133
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,480
I thought you went to bed hours ago.
I was writing a note for Lynch.

134
00:08:17,515 --> 00:08:19,520
I need the governess cart tomorrow.

135
00:08:19,555 --> 00:08:21,845
Oh?
I'm going to Malton.

136
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,725
Oh, don't risk the traffic
in Malton.

137
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,125
Not now every Tom, Dick and Harry
seems to have a motor.

138
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,760
Hardly. Last time, there were five
cars parked in the market place

139
00:08:29,795 --> 00:08:32,125
and another three drove past
while I was waiting.

140
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:35,840
Get Branson to take you in the car.
Neither of us are using it.

141
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:37,480
I thought I'd pop in
on old Mrs Stuart.

142
00:08:37,515 --> 00:08:39,960
Will you tell Mama, if I forget?

143
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,245
You're late this morning.

144
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,560
The library grate needed
a real going over.

145
00:08:53,595 --> 00:08:55,725
Are any of them down yet?

146
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,880
Lady Sybil's in the dining room.
I'll start with her room, then.

147
00:08:58,915 --> 00:09:00,405
Daisy?

148
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:04,080
You know when you were talking about
the feeling of death in the house?

149
00:09:04,115 --> 00:09:06,045
I was just being silly.

150
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,485
I found myself wondering
about the connection

151
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:12,600
between the poor Turkish gentleman,
Mr Pamuk, and Lady Mary's room.

152
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:17,480
Only you were saying how you felt
so uncomfortable in there.

153
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,725
Well, I've...

154
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,840
I've got to get on.
I'm late enough as it is.

155
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,320
Hello.

156
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,180
Is everything all right?
Oh, hello.

157
00:09:44,215 --> 00:09:46,320
I am about to send a telegram.
Oh.

158
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:52,285
Papa's sister is always nagging him
to send supplies to London

159
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,040
and then we cable her, so her butler
can be at King's Cross to meet them.

160
00:09:56,075 --> 00:09:59,480
It's idiotic, really.
Is this Lady Rosamond Painswick?

161
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:01,405
You HAVE done your homework.

162
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,205
She wrote to welcome me
into the family,

163
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,120
which I thought pretty generous
given the circumstances.

164
00:10:06,155 --> 00:10:09,000
It's easy to be generous
when you have nothing to lose.

165
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:14,280
So are you doing any more
church visiting with Edith?

166
00:10:14,315 --> 00:10:16,365
My mother's trying
to set something up.

167
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,820
Well, watch out.
I think she has big plans for you.

168
00:10:18,855 --> 00:10:21,240
Then she's in for an equally
big disappointment.

169
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,245
Is it all right to do the fire?

170
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,645
Why are you so late?
I went back to my room

171
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:38,040
after I'd woken everyone, and I
just shut my eyes for a moment.

172
00:10:38,075 --> 00:10:40,137
I've been trying
to catch up ever since.

173
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:42,200
Have you had any breakfast?
Not a crumb.

174
00:10:42,235 --> 00:10:44,165
Here.

175
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,885
You can't take her biscuits.

176
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,005
She never eats them. None of them do.

177
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,760
They're just thrown away and changed
every evening. Thanks.

178
00:10:50,795 --> 00:10:53,600
She won't mind anyway.
She's nice, Lady Sybil.

179
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,320
Ugh.

180
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,240
Gwen?

181
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,920
May I ask why you are sitting
on Lady Sybil's bed?

182
00:11:06,955 --> 00:11:09,605
Well, you see, I had a turn.

183
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:12,080
Like a burst of sickness.
Just sudden, like.

184
00:11:12,115 --> 00:11:15,565
I had to sit down.
It's true.

185
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,360
You'd better go and lie down.
I will tell Mrs Hughes.

186
00:11:18,395 --> 00:11:20,245
I don't need to interrupt
her morning.

187
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:23,245
I'm sure I'll be fine,
if I could just put my feet up.

188
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:27,040
And how many bedrooms have you still
got to do? Just one. Lady Edith's.

189
00:11:27,075 --> 00:11:28,845
And you can manage on your own?

190
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,360
Well, she's no use to man or beast
in that state. Go on.

191
00:11:32,395 --> 00:11:33,880
Shoo.

192
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:42,400
Daisy, may I ask why you are holding
Lady Sybil's biscuit jar?

193
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,200
I was just polishing it
before I put it back.

194
00:11:48,235 --> 00:11:50,200
See that you do.

195
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,400
I'm sorry, milady,
but I can't do more than my best.

196
00:12:01,435 --> 00:12:03,845
Is there some difficulty,
Your Ladyship?

197
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,920
Dear Mrs Hughes, as you know
we're giving a dinner on Friday

198
00:12:06,955 --> 00:12:10,205
for Sir Anthony Strallan?
Yes, milady.

199
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,720
It seems he is particularly fond
of a new pudding.

200
00:12:12,755 --> 00:12:15,200
It's called Apple Charlotte.
Do you know it?

201
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:17,925
I'm not sure.

202
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,080
His sister, Mrs Chetwood,
sent me the receipt.

203
00:12:20,115 --> 00:12:22,200
I'm trying to persuade Mrs Patmore
to make it.

204
00:12:22,235 --> 00:12:24,085
And I'm trying to persuade
Her Ladyship

205
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,320
that I have planned the dinner
with her and I can't change it now.

206
00:12:27,355 --> 00:12:30,537
Why not? Because everything's
been ordered and prepared.

207
00:12:30,572 --> 00:12:33,720
Well, there's nothing here
that looks very complicated.

208
00:12:33,755 --> 00:12:35,645
Apples, lemons, butter...

209
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,040
I cannot work from a new receipt
at a moment's notice!

210
00:12:38,075 --> 00:12:40,920
But I can read it to you,
if that's the problem.

211
00:12:40,955 --> 00:12:43,445
Problem? Who mentioned a problem?

212
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:47,245
How dare you say such a thing
in front of Her Ladyship!

213
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:50,600
Very well. We'll try it another time
when you've had longer to prepare.

214
00:12:50,635 --> 00:12:52,440
We'll stay
with the raspberry meringue.

215
00:12:52,475 --> 00:12:54,600
And very nice it'll be, too.

216
00:12:54,635 --> 00:12:56,720
I'm sure.

217
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,280
Have you taken leave of your senses?

218
00:13:01,315 --> 00:13:03,737
I'm so sorry about that, milady.

219
00:13:03,772 --> 00:13:06,160
Never mind. I was asking a lot.

220
00:13:06,195 --> 00:13:08,605
Do look after that girl.

221
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,485
Daisy? She's used to it.
She'll be all right.

222
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:15,320
I wonder. Mrs Patmore looks ready
to eat her alive.

223
00:13:15,355 --> 00:13:17,325
I was only trying to help.

224
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,600
Like Judas was only trying to help,
I suppose,

225
00:13:19,635 --> 00:13:21,840
when he brought the Roman soldiers
to the garden!

226
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:40,800
I had to let the skirt down
a little, but I can put it back.

227
00:13:40,835 --> 00:13:42,805
No, it's yours.

228
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,400
What will happen if one of the maids
finds your room empty?

229
00:13:45,435 --> 00:13:47,800
It'd only be Anna
and she wouldn't give me away.

230
00:13:47,835 --> 00:13:49,920
She's like a sister.
She'd never betray me.

231
00:13:49,955 --> 00:13:51,800
Then she's not like my sisters.

232
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,480
Walk on.

233
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,645
Shall I give you a hand?

234
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,400
Ah, would you?
It takes half the time with two.

235
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,920
I always feel a bit sorry
for Lady Edith.

236
00:14:09,955 --> 00:14:12,325
Me too. Although I don't know why.

237
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,525
When you think what she's got
and we haven't.

238
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,160
Mrs Hughes said she was after
the other heir, Mr Patrick Crawley.

239
00:14:18,195 --> 00:14:20,000
The one who drowned.
That was different.

240
00:14:20,035 --> 00:14:22,005
She was in love with him.

241
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,060
What happened?
She never got a look-in.

242
00:14:24,095 --> 00:14:26,045
He was all set up to marry Lady Mary.

243
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,560
Then he's a braver man than I am,
Gunga Din.

244
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,845
Sad to think about.

245
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:37,280
It's always sad when you love someone
who doesn't love you back.

246
00:14:37,315 --> 00:14:39,240
No matter who you are.

247
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,520
No, I mean it's sad that he died.

248
00:14:43,555 --> 00:14:45,437
Oh.

249
00:14:45,472 --> 00:14:47,285
Yes.

250
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,440
Very sad.

251
00:14:49,475 --> 00:14:51,525
He was nice.

252
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:54,565
Well, thank you for that.

253
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,045
Much appreciated.
My pleasure.

254
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:01,440
Perhaps Mr Patrick did love her
back, he just couldn't say.

255
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,045
Why ever not?

256
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:09,080
Sometimes we're not at liberty
to speak.

257
00:15:09,115 --> 00:15:11,560
Sometimes it wouldn't be right.

258
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,480
Take a seat.

259
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,445
The flower show?

260
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,240
Oh, I thought I was in for another
telling off about the hospital.

261
00:16:02,275 --> 00:16:04,925
No, this time it's the flower show.

262
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:07,365
I've been to see
old Mr Molesley's garden

263
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,520
and his roses are the most beautiful
I've ever laid eyes on.

264
00:16:10,555 --> 00:16:13,125
Go on.

265
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:16,125
You may not know it, but I believe
the committee feel obliged

266
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,240
to give you the cup for the Best
Bloom as a kind of local tradition.

267
00:16:19,275 --> 00:16:21,845
No. No, I do not know that.

268
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:25,600
I thought I usually won the prize
for Best Bloom In The Village

269
00:16:25,635 --> 00:16:29,320
because my gardener had grown
the best bloom in the village.

270
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:32,880
Yes, but you don't USUALLY win,
do you?

271
00:16:32,915 --> 00:16:34,640
You always win.

272
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:39,565
Yes. I have been very fortunate
in that regard.

273
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,160
But, surely, when Mr Molesley's
garden is so remarkable

274
00:16:43,195 --> 00:16:45,880
and he is so very proud
of his roses -

275
00:16:45,915 --> 00:16:48,617
You talk of Mr Molesley's pride.

276
00:16:48,652 --> 00:16:51,285
What about my gardener's pride?

277
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:54,880
Is he to be sacrificed on the altar
of Molesley's ambition?

278
00:16:54,915 --> 00:16:57,160
All I'm asking is
that you release them

279
00:16:57,195 --> 00:16:59,645
from any obligation to let you win.

280
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,520
Why not just tell them to choose
whichever flower is best?

281
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:05,360
But that is precisely
what they already know.

282
00:17:05,395 --> 00:17:07,360
And do!

283
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,000
I'm sorry, milord.
I didn't think you'd be in here.

284
00:17:25,035 --> 00:17:28,240
Are my eyes deceiving me
or is one of these missing?

285
00:17:28,275 --> 00:17:30,280
I don't know them well enough.

286
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:32,285
No. Why would you?

287
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,340
But there's a very pretty
little blue one

288
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:36,325
with a miniature framed
in French paste.

289
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,800
It was made for a German prince.
I forget who...

290
00:17:38,835 --> 00:17:40,880
Unless it's been moved
for some reason.

291
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,200
But why would it be?

292
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,965
Can you help.
I shall be so grateful.

293
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,480
Our horse has cast a shoe.
Is there a smithy nearby?

294
00:18:02,515 --> 00:18:04,640
Aye, you can try old Crump
in the next village.

295
00:18:04,675 --> 00:18:06,285
Thank you.

296
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,205
You see? Help's at hand.

297
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,080
At least it happened
on the way home.

298
00:18:10,115 --> 00:18:12,137
Well, they'll be worried about you.

299
00:18:12,172 --> 00:18:14,160
And if they check on me,
I'm finished.

300
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,400
Is Her Ladyship wearing that now?

301
00:18:18,435 --> 00:18:20,205
This is for Friday night.

302
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,320
I thought I'd give it a press
while I had time.

303
00:18:22,355 --> 00:18:24,325
Do you know what's happened
to Lady Sybil?

304
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:27,080
The others' changes are ready,
but there's no sign of her.

305
00:18:27,115 --> 00:18:30,337
Don't you start. I've had Her
Majesty on at me all afternoon.

306
00:18:30,372 --> 00:18:33,525
Mr Carson says he'll fetch the
police if she's not back soon.

307
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:36,640
Sorry, Miss, but Mr Crump's staying
over at the Skelton estate tonight.

308
00:18:36,675 --> 00:18:38,880
He's working there all week.
Is there anyone else?

309
00:18:38,915 --> 00:18:40,720
Not that I know of.

310
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,000
Come on Dragon. Come on!

311
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:01,200
Dragon, if you don't move now,
I'll have you boiled for glue!

312
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,645
What if she's overturned?

313
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,845
What if she's lying in a ditch
somewhere?

314
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,365
I'm sure she'll be back
in the shake of a lamb's tail.

315
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,080
The truth is they're all getting
too old for a mother's control.

316
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:20,417
They're growing up.
They've grown up.

317
00:19:20,452 --> 00:19:22,426
They need their own establishments.

318
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:24,400
I'm sure they'll get plenty
of offers.

319
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,280
No-one ever warns you about bringing
up daughters.

320
00:19:29,315 --> 00:19:31,405
You think it's going
to be like Little Women.

321
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,400
Instead they're at each other's
throats from dawn till dusk.

322
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,480
You look done in.

323
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,560
I'll bring you some food up later
when we've finished dinner.

324
00:19:48,595 --> 00:19:50,640
Where were you?

325
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,005
You came up, then?

326
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:57,120
Of course I did.
I had to change for the afternoon.

327
00:19:57,155 --> 00:19:59,680
Did you cover for me?
What do you think?

328
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,480
I don't suppose this had anything
to do with Lady Sybil.

329
00:20:04,515 --> 00:20:07,725
Oh, Anna, it was a nightmare.

330
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,180
I don't know how I got in
without being seen.

331
00:20:10,215 --> 00:20:12,600
I'm sure I left a trail of mud
up the stairs.

332
00:20:12,635 --> 00:20:15,680
So...did you get the job?

333
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:20,320
Well, we'll have to wait and see.

334
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,285
Sorry to bother you, milady,

335
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,165
but your mother wanted you
to know Lady Sybil's back.

336
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,600
She's changing now, so dinner won't
be late, after all. What happened?

337
00:20:38,635 --> 00:20:40,360
The horse went lame.

338
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,560
Is there anything else?

339
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,320
There is something
that's been troubling me.

340
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,880
You remember the Turkish gentleman,
Mr Pamuk?

341
00:20:54,915 --> 00:20:56,717
The one who died all sudden, like.

342
00:20:56,752 --> 00:20:58,520
Of course I remember.
Well...

343
00:20:58,555 --> 00:21:00,480
it's Daisy, milady.

344
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,245
The kitchen maid.

345
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,965
Only she's been talking recently

346
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,760
as if she had ideas
about Mr Pamuk's death.

347
00:21:08,795 --> 00:21:11,365
What sort of ideas?

348
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,525
Well, I've no proof
and maybe I'm wrong.

349
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:18,400
But I've a sense she knows
something, but won't say what.

350
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,080
Something involving Lady Mary.

351
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,940
Well, how absurd.

352
00:21:26,975 --> 00:21:29,205
What could she know?

353
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:32,720
Whatever it is, she won't say.
Not to us, anyway.

354
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:37,240
Have you spoken to Lady Mary
about this?

355
00:21:37,275 --> 00:21:39,245
I didn't like to, milady.

356
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,485
It seemed impertinent somehow.

357
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:45,000
But I thought someone in the family
ought to know about it.

358
00:21:45,035 --> 00:21:46,720
Quite right.

359
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:54,280
Bring the girl to my room...
tomorrow. After breakfast.

360
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,040
What did she want?

361
00:22:03,075 --> 00:22:04,725
Nothing.

362
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:07,680
Just a message from Mama to say
that Sybil had turned up alive.

363
00:22:07,715 --> 00:22:09,480
Poor darling.

364
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,845
She had to walk for miles.

365
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,320
I don't think I'd have got down,
however lame the horse.

366
00:22:15,355 --> 00:22:16,725
No.

367
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,800
I don't believe you would.

368
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,125
I couldn't say, milady.

369
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,080
I don't know
what Miss O'Brien means.

370
00:22:37,115 --> 00:22:38,720
I didn't see nothing.

371
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,645
Well, not much.

372
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,600
O'Brien,
I wonder if you might leave us?

373
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:58,880
Now...it's Daisy, isn't it?

374
00:22:58,915 --> 00:23:00,520
Yes, milady.

375
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,720
I'm sure you see O'Brien only acted
as she did because she is concerned.

376
00:23:05,755 --> 00:23:07,725
I suppose so, milady.

377
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:12,000
She seems to think that you are
in possession of some knowledge

378
00:23:12,035 --> 00:23:13,800
that is uncomfortable for you.

379
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,480
Because if that is the case,
then I don't think it fair on you.

380
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,960
Why should you be burdened
with Mary's secret?

381
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:29,120
My dear, my heart goes out to you.
It really does.

382
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,480
Oh, there, there.

383
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:39,320
You've been carrying too heavy
a burden for too long.

384
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,880
Just tell me...

385
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,920
..and I promise you'll feel better.

386
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,845
You seem well prepared.

387
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,840
They'll add a few more flowers
before we open in the morning,

388
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:04,977
but I think we're nearly there.

389
00:24:05,012 --> 00:24:07,080
Do look at Mr Molesley's display.

390
00:24:07,115 --> 00:24:08,760
He's worked so hard.

391
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:12,240
They're rather marvellous,
aren't they?

392
00:24:12,275 --> 00:24:13,845
Lovely.

393
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,800
Well done, Mr Molesley.
Thank you, milady.

394
00:24:16,835 --> 00:24:19,720
I think everyone
is to be congratulated.

395
00:24:19,755 --> 00:24:21,765
It's splendid.

396
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:25,085
But do look at these roses.
Have you ever seen the like?

397
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:29,000
My dear, Mrs Crawley believes I am
profiting from an unfair advantage.

398
00:24:29,035 --> 00:24:30,365
Oh?

399
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,600
She feels in the past
I have been given the cup

400
00:24:32,635 --> 00:24:34,765
merely as a matter of routine
rather than merit.

401
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:38,200
Rather ungallant, Mother. I'm sure
when we see Cousin Violet's roses,

402
00:24:38,235 --> 00:24:40,320
it will be hard to think
they could be bettered.

403
00:24:40,355 --> 00:24:42,240
Hard, but not impossible.

404
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,685
You are quite wonderful

405
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,800
the way you see room for improvement
wherever you look.

406
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,720
I never knew such reforming zeal.

407
00:24:52,755 --> 00:24:55,040
I take that as a compliment.

408
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,760
I must have said it wrong.

409
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,805
Poor Granny.
She's not used to being challenged.

410
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:09,240
Nor is Mother. I think we should
let them settle it between them.

411
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,180
So are you interested in flowers?

412
00:25:14,215 --> 00:25:16,485
I'm interested in the village.

413
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,480
In fact, I'm on my way
to inspect the cottages.

414
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,980
You know what all work and no play
did for Jack.

415
00:25:22,015 --> 00:25:24,320
But you think I'm a dull boy,
anyway, don't you?

416
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:28,040
I play, too.
I'm coming up for dinner tonight.

417
00:25:28,075 --> 00:25:30,360
I suspect I'm there
to balance the numbers.

418
00:25:30,395 --> 00:25:32,720
Is it in aid of anything?

419
00:25:32,755 --> 00:25:34,725
Not that I know of.

420
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:37,080
Just a couple of dreary neighbours,
that's all.

421
00:25:37,115 --> 00:25:39,080
Maybe I'll shine by comparison.

422
00:25:39,115 --> 00:25:41,240
Mary, we're going.

423
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:46,000
Maybe you will.

424
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,320
Might I have a word?

425
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,360
I want to say something
before I ring the gong.

426
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:05,845
I'm afraid it's not very pleasant.

427
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:09,525
His Lordship is missing
a very valuable snuff box.

428
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:13,120
It appears to have been taken
from the case in his room.

429
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:15,360
If one of you knows
anything about this,

430
00:26:15,395 --> 00:26:18,085
will he or she please come to me?

431
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:21,560
Your words will be heard
in the strictest confidence.

432
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,000
Thank you.

433
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,760
I am sorry, Mr Bates.

434
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,920
What an unpleasant thing
to have happened.

435
00:26:36,955 --> 00:26:39,045
Why are you picking on him?

436
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,280
Because he's the only one of us
who goes in there.

437
00:26:41,315 --> 00:26:43,080
But don't worry.
I'm sure it'll turn up.

438
00:26:43,115 --> 00:26:45,280
Thank you for your concern.

439
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,840
I hate this kind of thing.

440
00:26:54,875 --> 00:26:57,080
I hope to God they find it.

441
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,320
Better get a move on.

442
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,960
I'm coming.

443
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,845
Does this brooch work?

444
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,080
I can't decide.
It's charming.

445
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,645
Oh, dear. Is it another scolding?

446
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:29,240
Of course not. You're too grown up
to scold these days.

447
00:27:29,275 --> 00:27:31,005
Heavens.

448
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,960
Then it's really serious.

449
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:38,000
I'd like you to look after
Sir Anthony Strallan tonight.

450
00:27:38,035 --> 00:27:40,325
He's a nice, decent man.

451
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,805
His position may not be quite
like Papa's,

452
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:45,600
but it would still make you a force
for good in the county.

453
00:27:45,635 --> 00:27:48,177
Mama, not again.
How many times am I to be ordered

454
00:27:48,212 --> 00:27:50,720
to marry the man sitting next to me
at dinner?

455
00:27:50,755 --> 00:27:52,697
As many times as it takes.

456
00:27:52,732 --> 00:27:54,605
I turned down Matthew Crawley.

457
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,400
Is it likely I'd marry Strallan
when I wouldn't marry him?

458
00:27:57,435 --> 00:28:00,160
I am glad you've come to think
more highly of Cousin Matthew.

459
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,405
That's not the point.
No.

460
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,885
The point is
when you refused Matthew,

461
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:10,080
you were the daughter of an Earl
with an unsullied reputation.

462
00:28:10,115 --> 00:28:12,640
Now you are damaged goods.

463
00:28:12,675 --> 00:28:14,245
Mama...

464
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:17,200
Somehow, there is a rumour in
London, that you are not virtuous.

465
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,620
What? Does Papa know about this?

466
00:28:21,655 --> 00:28:24,125
He knows it and he dismisses it

467
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,720
because, unlike you and me,
he does not know that it is true.

468
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,780
Let's hope it's just unkind gossip.

469
00:28:34,815 --> 00:28:37,120
Because if anyone heard about...

470
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,805
Kemal.

471
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:44,120
My lover. Kemal Pamuk.

472
00:28:44,155 --> 00:28:45,805
Exactly.

473
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,420
If it gets around,
and you're not already married,

474
00:28:48,455 --> 00:28:51,000
every door in London
will be slammed in your face.

475
00:28:51,035 --> 00:28:53,720
Mama, the world is changing.

476
00:28:53,755 --> 00:28:55,805
Not that much...

477
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,040
and not fast enough for you.

478
00:28:58,075 --> 00:29:00,240
I know you mean to help.

479
00:29:00,275 --> 00:29:01,845
I know you love me.

480
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,005
But I also know what I'm capable of,

481
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:07,680
and forty years of boredom and duty
just isn't possible for me.

482
00:29:07,715 --> 00:29:09,845
I'm sorry.

483
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,600
I do love you...

484
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,440
and I want to help.

485
00:29:14,475 --> 00:29:16,245
I'm a lost cause, Mama.

486
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,880
Leave me to manage my own affairs.

487
00:29:18,915 --> 00:29:21,485
Why not concentrate on Edith?

488
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,040
She needs all the help she can get.

489
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:29,520
You mustn't be unkind to Edith.
She has fewer advantages than you.

490
00:29:29,555 --> 00:29:31,045
Fewer?

491
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,680
She has none at all.

492
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,920
Open the oven.

493
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,525
What's happened?
It's that bloomin' Daisy!

494
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:56,720
I've said she'll be the death of me,
and now my word's come true!

495
00:29:56,755 --> 00:29:59,160
Come and sit down.
Get away!

496
00:29:59,195 --> 00:30:01,085
Get back to the stables!

497
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,520
What'll you serve now?
Them, of course.

498
00:30:03,555 --> 00:30:05,725
I haven't got anything else.

499
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,440
Daisy, give us a hand,
get that cloth.

500
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,760
What's the matter with that?
Are you sure?

501
00:30:17,795 --> 00:30:20,720
Shouldn't we tell?
Certainly not.

502
00:30:20,755 --> 00:30:22,605
Is the remove ready to go up?

503
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,560
Daisy, give him a hand
with the vegetables.

504
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,480
They're up in the servery
in the warmer.

505
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,080
I'm glad I don't have to eat them.
What the eye can't see,

506
00:30:31,115 --> 00:30:32,680
the heart won't grieve over.

507
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,485
There's no doubt about it.

508
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:43,040
The next few years in farming are
going to be about mechanisation.

509
00:30:43,075 --> 00:30:46,440
That's the test
and we're going to have to meet it.

510
00:30:46,475 --> 00:30:48,857
Don't you agree, Lady Mary?

511
00:30:48,892 --> 00:30:51,240
Yes, of course, Sir Anthony.

512
00:30:51,275 --> 00:30:52,880
I'm sure I do.

513
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,920
Are we ever going to be allowed
to turn?

514
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:04,280
Sir Anthony, it must be so hard to
meet the challenge of the future,

515
00:31:04,315 --> 00:31:06,240
and yet be fair to your employees.

516
00:31:06,275 --> 00:31:08,805
That is the point precisely.

517
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:12,920
We can't fight progress, but we must
find ways to soften the blow.

518
00:31:12,955 --> 00:31:15,320
I should love to see one
of the new harvesters,

519
00:31:15,355 --> 00:31:17,117
if you would ever let me.

520
00:31:17,152 --> 00:31:18,816
We don't have one here.

521
00:31:18,851 --> 00:31:20,480
I shall be delighted.

522
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,800
I hope they find that snuff box.

523
00:31:27,835 --> 00:31:30,325
What happens if they don't?

524
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:33,240
They'll organise a search,
won't they? I wouldn't be Mr Bates.

525
00:31:33,275 --> 00:31:36,280
Not for all the tea in China.
Wouldn't you, Thomas?

526
00:31:36,315 --> 00:31:38,960
I dare say he feels
just the same about you.

527
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,600
What's the matter with you?
Nothing.

528
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,165
Just a minute!

529
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,460
I don't like to put it on earlier.

530
00:31:53,495 --> 00:31:55,720
It sinks in and spoils the effect.

531
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,320
Mama has released me, thank God.

532
00:32:04,355 --> 00:32:06,440
Sir Anthony seems nice enough.

533
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,960
If you want to talk farming
and foxes by the hour.

534
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:15,320
I'm rather looking forward
to the flower show tomorrow.

535
00:32:15,355 --> 00:32:18,485
Where Mr Molesley's roses
will turn everybody's heads.

536
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:21,120
But if you tell Granny I said so,
I'll denounce you as a liar.

537
00:32:21,155 --> 00:32:22,965
I wouldn't dare.

538
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,880
I'll leave that
to my fearless mother.

539
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:31,400
How are the cottages? Coming on
wonderfully. I'd love to show you.

540
00:32:31,435 --> 00:32:33,520
Obviously,
it's an act of faith at this stage.

541
00:32:33,555 --> 00:32:35,125
Yes.

542
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,500
Good God!

543
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,760
What on earth...?
I do apologise, Lady Grantham.

544
00:32:41,795 --> 00:32:43,720
But I had a mouthful of salt.
What?

545
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,240
Everyone! Put down your forks!

546
00:32:48,275 --> 00:32:51,245
Carson, remove this.

547
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:55,280
Bring fruit, bring cheese, bring
anything to take this taste away!

548
00:32:55,315 --> 00:32:57,805
Sir Anthony, I am so sorry.

549
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:02,400
Fains I be Mrs Patmore's kitchen
maid when the news gets out.

550
00:33:02,435 --> 00:33:04,680
Poor girl. We ought to send in
a rescue party.

551
00:33:04,715 --> 00:33:07,417
You must think us very disorganised.

552
00:33:07,452 --> 00:33:10,120
No not at all. These things happen.

553
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,645
Hey, come on.

554
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,460
It's not that bad.

555
00:33:18,495 --> 00:33:20,205
Nobody's died.

556
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,965
I don't understand it.

557
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,285
It must have been that Daisy.

558
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:27,200
She's muddled everything up
before now! But I never -

559
00:33:27,235 --> 00:33:30,080
Don't worry, Daisy.
You're not in the line of fire.

560
00:33:30,115 --> 00:33:33,245
I know that pudding!
I chose it cos I know it!

561
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:36,240
Which is why you wouldn't let Her
Ladyship have the pudding she wanted.

562
00:33:36,275 --> 00:33:38,080
Because you didn't know it.

563
00:33:38,115 --> 00:33:39,320
Exactly!

564
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,565
I don't see how it happened.

565
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:51,520
Come on, everyone. Let's give Mrs
Patmore some room to breathe.

566
00:33:51,555 --> 00:33:53,445
You, too.

567
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:56,440
I don't think I should leave her.
Mr Carson knows what he's doing.

568
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,245
Don't do that.

569
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:03,720
Get William or the hall boy to
do it. It's beneath your dignity.

570
00:34:03,755 --> 00:34:05,760
It won't kill me.

571
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,240
Now...

572
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,400
..all in your own good time.

573
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:19,600
I think you've got something
to tell me...

574
00:34:19,635 --> 00:34:21,480
haven't you?

575
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:31,400
I think I know
where that snuff box is.

576
00:34:31,435 --> 00:34:33,165
Where?

577
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,085
Hidden in your room.

578
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,360
You don't think -
Of Course I don't.

579
00:34:37,395 --> 00:34:39,965
You silly beggar.

580
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,120
Then -? I bet Thomas would like it,
if they took you for a thief.

581
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:47,285
Yes. I expect he would.

582
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,525
Go upstairs now and find it.

583
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:52,600
And when you have, you can choose
whether to put it in Thomas's room.

584
00:34:52,635 --> 00:34:55,360
Or give it to me,
and I'll slip it into Miss O'Brien's.

585
00:34:55,395 --> 00:34:57,205
You naughty girl.

586
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,880
Fight fire with fire.
That's what my Mum says.

587
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:08,040
Poor Mrs Patmore. Do you think you
should go down and see her?

588
00:35:08,075 --> 00:35:11,600
Tomorrow. She needs time
to recover her nerves.

589
00:35:11,635 --> 00:35:14,045
I knew there was something going on.

590
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:17,320
It seems hard that poor Sir Anthony
had to pay the price.

591
00:35:17,355 --> 00:35:18,760
Good God!

592
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:23,720
As for you giggling like
a schoolgirl with Cousin Matthew!

593
00:35:23,755 --> 00:35:26,085
It was pathetic.

594
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:29,200
Poor Edith. I'm sorry Cousin Matthew
proved a disappointment to you.

595
00:35:29,235 --> 00:35:31,640
Who says he has?

596
00:35:31,675 --> 00:35:33,437
Matthew.

597
00:35:33,472 --> 00:35:35,165
He told me.

598
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,805
Oh, sorry. Wasn't I supposed to know?

599
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:42,760
You were very helpful, Edith,
looking after Sir Anthony.

600
00:35:42,795 --> 00:35:44,480
You saved the day.

601
00:35:44,515 --> 00:35:46,525
I enjoyed it.

602
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,160
We seemed to have a lot
to talk about.

603
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,440
Spare me your boasting, please.

604
00:36:02,475 --> 00:36:04,925
Now who's jealous?
Jealous?

605
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,040
Do you think I couldn't have
him if I wanted him?

606
00:36:07,075 --> 00:36:10,217
Even you can't take every prize.

607
00:36:10,252 --> 00:36:13,360
Is that a challenge?
If you like.

608
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,525
I could almost manage
for a long time,

609
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:23,880
knowing the kitchen
and where everything was kept.

610
00:36:23,915 --> 00:36:26,405
Even with that fool girl.

611
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:29,200
I think you might owe Daisy
an apology.

612
00:36:29,235 --> 00:36:31,165
Maybe.

613
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,040
I've had a lot to put up with,
I can tell you.

614
00:36:34,075 --> 00:36:36,685
And you've not been to a doctor?

615
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:40,640
I don't need a doctor
to tell me I'm going blind.

616
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:47,200
A blind cook, Mr Carson.

617
00:36:47,235 --> 00:36:49,245
What a joke.

618
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,360
Whoever heard of such a thing?

619
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,400
A blind cook.

620
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,960
I hope our salty pudding
didn't spoil the evening for you.

621
00:37:03,995 --> 00:37:05,885
On the contrary.

622
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,885
I'm glad you and Mary
are getting along.

623
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,445
There's no reason you can't be
friends. No reason at all.

624
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:14,120
I don't suppose there's any chance
that you could sort of start again?

625
00:37:14,155 --> 00:37:16,640
Life is full of surprises.

626
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:22,165
Ah. I've been waiting for you.

627
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:26,000
I've found a book and it's just
the thing to catch your interest.

628
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:28,157
Oh, really?
I'm intrigued what could it be?

629
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:30,245
Well I was looking in the library
and I...

630
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:34,120
I was very taken by what you were
saying over dinner about the -

631
00:37:34,155 --> 00:37:36,217
You're so right, Lady Mary.
How clever you are.

632
00:37:36,252 --> 00:37:38,280
This is exactly
what we have to be aware of.

633
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:44,680
There's a section here I was rather
unsure about. I wonder if you...

634
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:52,840
It seems we have both been thrown
over for a bigger prize.

635
00:37:52,875 --> 00:37:55,605
Heavens, is that the time?

636
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:58,840
You're not going?
The truth is my head's splitting.

637
00:37:58,875 --> 00:38:02,040
I don't want to spoil the party
so I'll slip away.

638
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,400
Would you make my excuses
to your parents?

639
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,280
Excuse me, Sir Anthony.

640
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:22,245
Has Mr Crawley left?
Yes, milady.

641
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:25,920
But what about the car? Branson can't
have brought it round so quickly.

642
00:38:25,955 --> 00:38:27,760
He said he'd rather walk, milady.

643
00:38:27,795 --> 00:38:29,360
Thank you.

644
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,560
Mary can be such a child.

645
00:38:32,595 --> 00:38:34,360
What do you mean, darling?

646
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,405
She thinks if you put a toy down,

647
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:41,280
it'll still be sitting there when
you want to play with it again.

648
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,440
What are you talking about?

649
00:38:47,475 --> 00:38:49,080
Never mind.

650
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,765
Mr Carson?

651
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:04,660
We were wondering
about that snuff box.

652
00:39:04,695 --> 00:39:07,707
Has it turned up yet?
I'm afraid not.

653
00:39:07,742 --> 00:39:10,685
Well, I think we should have
a search.

654
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:14,245
What? It doesn't do to leave these
things too long.

655
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:17,800
Mr Carson can search the men's rooms,
Mrs Hughes the women's.

656
00:39:17,835 --> 00:39:21,040
And it should be right away,
now we've talked of it.

657
00:39:21,075 --> 00:39:22,760
So no-one has a chance
to hide the box.

658
00:39:22,795 --> 00:39:24,565
Don't you agree, Mr Carson?

659
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,445
Well, perhaps it's for the best.

660
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,080
Although I'm sure
I won't find anything.

661
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:30,280
I'll fetch Mrs Hughes.

662
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,120
I think I'll just um...
I'd better check it's tidy.

663
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:40,560
The bastard's hidden it in my room
or yours.

664
00:39:40,595 --> 00:39:43,040
Why did I ever listen to you
in the first place?

665
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,480
Miss O'Brien?

666
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:55,240
My, my. You have been busy.

667
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:04,240
I was expecting you later than this.

668
00:40:04,275 --> 00:40:06,520
I'll tell Molesley to lock up.
Thanks.

669
00:40:06,555 --> 00:40:08,160
Good night, Mother.

670
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:13,280
How was your evening?
Did you enjoy yourself?

671
00:40:13,315 --> 00:40:15,245
Quite.

672
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:18,120
The thing is,
just for a moment I thought -

673
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:23,120
Never mind what I thought.
I was wrong.

674
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,920
Good night.

675
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:43,680
My word, Molesley, splendid roses.
Well done. Thank you, Your Lordship.

676
00:40:43,715 --> 00:40:46,160
All the stalls are set out very well
this year.

677
00:40:46,195 --> 00:40:48,245
This is enchanting.

678
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:51,240
Do we grow this? I doubt if you've
got that one, Your Ladyship.

679
00:40:51,275 --> 00:40:53,645
I've only just found it, myself.

680
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,640
Is it a secret?
Or could you tell Mr Brocket?

681
00:40:56,675 --> 00:40:58,765
I'd be glad to, milady.

682
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,640
He should come and see the rose
garden. He could give us some ideas.

683
00:41:01,675 --> 00:41:03,485
Old Molseley's a champion.

684
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,640
Or he would be, in a fairer world.

685
00:41:05,675 --> 00:41:07,845
Don't you start.

686
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:10,840
I'm afraid I've been annoying
Cousin Violet on that score.

687
00:41:10,875 --> 00:41:13,560
If Molesley deserves the first prize
for his flowers

688
00:41:13,595 --> 00:41:15,685
the judges will give it to him.

689
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:18,920
They wouldn't dare. Really, Robert.
You make me so annoyed.

690
00:41:18,955 --> 00:41:21,245
Isn't it possible
I should win the thing on merit?

691
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,040
I think the appropriate answer
to that, Mama, is 'Yes, dear.'

692
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,805
I don't know why we're bothering.

693
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,720
We'll have missed the speeches
as it is.

694
00:41:30,755 --> 00:41:32,525
Don't be such a grouch.

695
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,800
You should have punished one of them
at least.

696
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,440
They know that I know.
That's worth something.

697
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,120
What do you think will happen
to Mrs Patmore?

698
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:47,645
She'll muddle through
with Daisy for help.

699
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:50,960
In the long term, we'll have to wait
for the doctor to give his opinion.

700
00:41:50,995 --> 00:41:52,960
I hope there's something they can do.

701
00:41:52,995 --> 00:41:54,965
I hope so, too.

702
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,280
But if there isn't,
I hope they tell her there isn't.

703
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,720
Nothing is harder to live with
than false hope.

704
00:42:00,755 --> 00:42:03,440
I wish you'd just come out with it.

705
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:06,205
With what?

706
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,360
Whatever it is you're keeping secret.

707
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,120
I can't.

708
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:19,300
You don't deny it, then?

709
00:42:19,335 --> 00:42:21,325
No, I don't deny it.

710
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:23,240
And I don't deny
you've a right to ask.

711
00:42:23,275 --> 00:42:25,240
But I can't.

712
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:29,000
I'm not a free man.

713
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,765
Are you trying to tell me
that you're married?

714
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:36,120
I have been married, yes,
but that's not all of it.

715
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,160
Because...

716
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,445
..because I love you, Mr Bates.

717
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:45,520
I know it's not ladylike to say it...

718
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:49,920
..but I'm not a lady and I don't
pretend to be.

719
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,845
You are a lady to me.

720
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:58,480
And I never knew a finer one.

721
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:05,080
If you want a lift,
I can take one of you, but not more.

722
00:43:05,115 --> 00:43:07,085
One of the women.

723
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:09,520
No, you must go. Then we can all
hurry and meet you there.

724
00:43:09,555 --> 00:43:11,205
Yes all right.

725
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:13,285
I mustn't slow you down.

726
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:16,040
There's been too much of that
already.

727
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:40,000
Have you recovered from our ordeal?

728
00:43:40,035 --> 00:43:42,205
I got a letter this morning.

729
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,800
They must have written it as soon
as I left the office.

730
00:43:44,835 --> 00:43:47,245
They are pleased to have met me,

731
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:50,620
but I do not quite fit
their requirements.

732
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:53,925
So it was all for nothing.
I don't agree.

733
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:56,485
Only a fool doesn't know
when they've been beaten.

734
00:43:56,520 --> 00:44:00,120
Then I'm a fool, for I'm a long way
from being beaten yet.

735
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:05,085
And now...

736
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:09,160
When you ran off last night,
I hope you hadn't thought me rude.

737
00:44:09,195 --> 00:44:11,257
Certainly not.
I monopolised you at dinner.

738
00:44:11,292 --> 00:44:13,285
I had no right
to any more of your time.

739
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:16,960
You see, Edith, and I had this sort
of bet - Please don't apologise.

740
00:44:16,995 --> 00:44:20,360
I had a lovely evening and
I'm glad we're on speaking terms.

741
00:44:20,395 --> 00:44:23,360
Now, I should look after my mother.

742
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:30,880
Why was Cousin Matthew
in such a hurry to get away?

743
00:44:30,915 --> 00:44:32,885
Don't be stupid.

744
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:35,360
I suppose you didn't want him
when he wanted you,

745
00:44:35,395 --> 00:44:37,617
and now it's the other way round.

746
00:44:37,652 --> 00:44:39,805
You have to admit it's quite funny.

747
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:42,220
I'll admit that
if I ever wanted to attract a man,

748
00:44:42,255 --> 00:44:44,600
I'd steer clear of those clothes
and that hat.

749
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,960
You think yourself so superior,
don't you?

750
00:44:47,995 --> 00:44:49,800
Ugh!

751
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:01,360
Well, I think she who laughs last
laughs longest.

752
00:45:01,395 --> 00:45:03,480
Did that missing box of yours
ever turn up?

753
00:45:03,515 --> 00:45:05,445
It was a fuss about nothing.

754
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:07,840
They must have put it back
on the wrong shelf, dusting.

755
00:45:07,875 --> 00:45:09,765
Bates found it this morning.

756
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:12,840
Next time, have a proper look before
you start complaining.

757
00:45:12,875 --> 00:45:15,040
I'm sure the servants were
frightened half to death.

758
00:45:15,075 --> 00:45:16,840
Mea Culpa.

759
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:28,800
And now the Grantham Cup for
the Best Bloom In The Village.

760
00:45:28,835 --> 00:45:32,000
And The Grantham Cup
is awarded to...

761
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:48,080
..Mr William Molesley...

762
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:53,040
..for his Comptesse Cabarousse rose.

763
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:56,880
Bravo! Well done!

764
00:45:56,915 --> 00:45:58,600
Bravo!

765
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,880
Congratulations, Mr Molesley.

766
00:46:09,915 --> 00:46:11,525
Thank you, milady.

767
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:13,525
Thank you for letting me have it.

768
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:16,280
It is the judge's who decide
these things, not me.

769
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:18,560
But very well done.

770
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:26,840
Congratulations.

771
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:30,125
Bravo, Mama.

772
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:33,720
That must have been a real
sacrifice. And bravely borne.

773
00:46:33,755 --> 00:46:35,480
I don't know
what everyone's on about.

774
00:46:35,515 --> 00:46:38,160
But I...
All is well, my dear.

775
00:46:38,195 --> 00:46:39,960
All is well.

776
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:16,040
But you agree with everything
he says? I do, my dear.
