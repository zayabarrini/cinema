00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,280
There you are, Mr Bates, it's in.
Came this morning.

3
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,200
They said it would,
which isn't quite the same thing.

4
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,920
Hello.

5
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,080
I could have posted that for you.

6
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,040
Well, I prefer to do it myself.

7
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,560
I'll wait outside.

00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:06,440
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

9
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,600
Oh!

10
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,680
What are you doing?

11
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,680
If you must know, I'm trying to find
some space on top of the cupboard,

12
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,640
to make life easier.

13
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,640
So what's in it, then? What?

14
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,160
The bleedin' great packing case
that weighs a ton, that's what.

15
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,840
Can you just leave it?

16
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,480
No I can't
and you'll tell me right now.

17
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:44,320
Anything interesting?
Not particularly.

18
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,200
It's from Evelyn Napier.

19
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,680
You met him with the Delderfields
last November at Doncaster Races.

20
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,240
Is that Lord Branksome's boy? It is.

21
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,960
Do you like him?

22
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,720
I don't dislike him.

23
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,360
And what's he writing about?
Nothing much.

24
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,480
He's out with the York and Ainsty
next week.

25
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,600
The meet is at Downton. He wants
some tea when he's up here.

26
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,680
Where's he staying? With friends?

27
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,360
He says he's found a pub
that caters for hunting.

28
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,440
Well, we can improve on that.

29
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,800
He must come here. He can send
the horses up early, if he wants.

30
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,840
He'll know why you're asking him.

31
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,680
I can't think what you mean.
His mother's a friend of mine.

32
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,400
She'll be pleased at the idea.

33
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,040
Not very pleased - she's dead.

34
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,000
All the more reason, then.

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,240
You can write a note too
and put it in with mine.

36
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:36,360
Should I tell him about your
friendship with his late mother?

37
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,400
I'm sure you of all people can
compose a letter to a young man

38
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,320
without any help from me.

39
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:45,080
How much did it cost?
Every penny I'd saved.

40
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,120
Or, almost.

41
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,720
And...is this the mystery lover?

42
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:55,400
I've been taking a correspondence
course in typing and shorthand.

43
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,720
That's what was in the envelopes.

44
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,640
Are you any good?

45
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,280
Yes.

46
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,440
I am, actually.

47
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,000
(DOOR OPENS)

48
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,080
Her Ladyship wants the fawn skirt
Lady Mary never wears.

49
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,560
Her seamstress is going to fit it
to Lady Sybil, but I can't find it.

50
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,360
I'll come in a minute.

51
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,640
They're waiting now. One minute.

52
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,720
I'm just changing my cap and apron.

53
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,240
Have you told anyone?

54
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:32,560
What did your parents say? Well, I
can't tell them till I've got a job.

55
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,560
Dad will think I'm a fool
to leave a good place,

56
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,360
and Mum will say
I'm getting above myself, but...

57
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,400
but I don't believe that.

58
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,000
Nor do I.

59
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,160
It's not of my doing.

60
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,600
It's all Mary's own work,
but I think we should encourage it.

61
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,400
Branksome's a dull dog,
but I don't suppose that matters.

62
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,280
Did you know his wife had died?
He only ever talks about racing.

63
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,960
Cora is right.

64
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:59,280
Mary won't take Matthew Crawley,

65
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,360
so we'd better get her settled,

66
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,840
before the bloom is quite gone
off the rose.

67
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,880
Is the family an old one?

68
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,320
Older than yours, I imagine.

69
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,520
Old enough. And there's plenty of
money.

70
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,200
Really? Mm.

71
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,640
Mama, you've already looked him up
in the stud books

72
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,640
and made enquiries about the
fortune, don't pretend otherwise.

73
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,960
Are you afraid someone will think
you're American if you speak openly?

74
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,720
I doubt it'll come to that.

75
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,000
Shall I ring for tea?
No, not for me.

76
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,680
I'm meeting Cripps at five.

77
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,720
I'll see you at dinner.

78
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,960
You don't seem very pleased.

79
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,160
I'm pleased.

80
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,680
It's not brilliant, but I'm pleased.

81
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:40,360
So...? I don't want Robert to use a
marriage

82
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:44,160
as an excuse to stop fighting for
Mary's inheritance.

83
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,120
It won't make any difference.

84
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,960
I don't think he has the slightest
intention of fighting as it is.

85
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:54,040
The price of saving Downton is to
accept Matthew Crawley as his heir.

86
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,080
What about you?

87
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,120
I don't dislike Matthew

88
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,480
in fact, I rather admire him.

89
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,600
Is that sufficient reason
to give him your money?

90
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,200
Of course not. Then there's nothing
more to be said.

91
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,840
Are we going to have tea or not?

92
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,400
(RINGS BELL)

93
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,240
Oh. Hello.

94
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,280
I'd offer you a lift, if I could.

95
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,640
It was you I was coming to see.

96
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,960
Then, your timing is matchless.
I've just got off the train.

97
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,160
The other day at dinner,

98
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,600
cousin Isobel was saying you wanted
to see some of the local churches.

99
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,360
She's right, I do.

100
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,400
I want to know more about the county
generally if I'm to live here.

101
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,280
Well, I thought I might show you
a few of the nearer ones.

102
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:41,240
We could take a picnic and make an
outing of it.

103
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,400
That's very kind.
Nonsense, I'll enjoy it.

104
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,360
It's too long since I played
the tourist.

105
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,600
Well, it would have to be
a Saturday.

106
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,120
Churches work on Sunday and I work
all the weekdays.

107
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,800
Then, Saturday it is.

108
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,840
I'll get Lynch to sort out the
governess cart

109
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,800
and I'll pick you up at about 11.

110
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,040
How does it work? It's easy.

111
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:09,080
You just press the letters
and they print on the paper.

112
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,360
Get back, please.

113
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,920
They were trying to hide it,
so I knew it was wrong.

114
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,000
Where's Gwen now?

115
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,920
Doing the dining room with Anna.
They'll be finished soon.

116
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,000
Then I'll wait.

117
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,360
With all due respect, Mr Carson,
Gwen is under my jurisdiction.

118
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,200
Indeed she is, Mrs Hughes,

119
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,880
and I have no intention of
usurping your authority.

120
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,120
I merely want to get to
the bottom of it.

121
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,240
Why shouldn't Gwen have a typewriter?
Mind your own business.

122
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,880
What's that doing here?

123
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,680
Ah, Gwen, come in.

124
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,200
Why is that down here? Who's been
in my room? They had no right.

125
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:49,680
See, in the first place, none of the
rooms in this house belong to you.

126
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,440
And, in the second, I am in charge
of your welfare,

127
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,600
and that gives me every right.
This is you, isn't it?

128
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,680
All we want is to know what Gwen
wants with a typewriter

129
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,920
and why she feels the need
to keep it secret.

130
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,240
She wants to keep it private,
not secret.

131
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,280
There's a difference. Amen.

132
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,280
I've done nothing to be ashamed of.

133
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:12,120
I've bought a typewriter and I've
taken a postal course in shorthand.

134
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,800
I'm not aware that either
of these actions is illegal.

135
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,840
Will you tell us why?
Preferably without any more cheek.

136
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,480
Because I want to leave service.

137
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,880
I want to be a secretary.

138
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,440
You want to leave service?

139
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,800
What's wrong with being in service?
Nothing's wrong with it

140
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,560
and there's nothing wrong with
mending roads neither,

141
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,880
but it's not what I want to do.

142
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,640
I should remind you that
there are plenty of young girls

143
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,960
who would be glad of a position
in this house.

144
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,880
When I hand in my notice,
I shall be happy to think one of
them will be taking my place.

145
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,320
What makes you think
we'll wait till then?

146
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,480
Are you hiring and sacking now,
Miss O'Brien?

147
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,720
I thought that lay with Mr Carson
and Mrs Hughes.

148
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,080
Enough of this. I'm going to ring
the dressing gong

149
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,960
and we'll have no more talk of this
tonight.

150
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,320
Can I have my machine back now?

151
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:07,160
Very well, but I wish I was sure
you know what you're doing.

152
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,840
Daisy, what's happened to you?

153
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,880
I said you could go for
a drink of water,

154
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,440
not a trip up the Nile.

155
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,240
Which churches will you show him?

156
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,360
I can't decide.

157
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,800
Kirby, possibly,
or perhaps Easingwold.

158
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,280
You don't think you're being
a bit obvious?

159
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,240
Coming from you, that's rich.

160
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,080
There was a letter from Mr Napier
in the evening post.

161
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,280
Oh, did he accept? Not yet.

162
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,520
Perhaps he thought it was
too obvious.

163
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,880
Apparently he's bringing a friend
with him,

164
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,960
an attache at the Turkish Embassy.

165
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:45,480
A Mr Kemal Pamuk.

166
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,960
He's the son of one of the sultan's
ministers

167
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,040
and he's here for the Albanian talks.

168
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,240
What's that? To create an
independent Albania.

169
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,680
Don't you read the papers?
I'm too busy living a life.

170
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,520
Since Turkey's signature is vital,

171
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:01,080
Mr Napier's been given the job of
keeping him happy

172
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,120
until the conference begins.

173
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,200
He's eager to try an English hunt.

174
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,160
I shall invite this Mr Pamuk
to stay here as well.

175
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,320
Who knows? A little hospitality
in an English house

176
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,600
may make all the difference
to the outcome.

177
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,880
And, Mary,
you will ride out with him.

178
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,960
Oh, Mama, must I?

179
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,880
My boots are at the menders
and I haven't ridden for weeks.

180
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,160
Anna, please see that Lady Mary
is fully equipped to go hunting.

181
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,120
Yes, Your Ladyship.

(DOOR CLOSES)
Yes?

184
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:45,800
I saw this advertisement
for a limp corrector.

185
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,560
Yes?

186
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,600
What does it do, exactly?

187
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,680
It corrects limps.

188
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,960
Does it work? Well, as I make it
and I advertise it,

189
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,000
is it likely I'd say no?

190
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,960
Could I see one?

191
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,640
Here we are.

192
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,880
You adjust this to the right height,
to minimise the limp.

193
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:25,520
You tighten these, gradually,
as tight as you can stand.

194
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:28,440
As the leg straightens,
the foot lowers to the floor.

Can't say it's gonna be easy
and you can't slack.

197
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,240
All right.

198
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,200

She asks if we can both dine
on Saturday.

200

There are two young men staying,

201
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,800
so you won't be so outnumbered
for once.

202
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,800
What men?

203
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,400
A Turkish diplomat called...
something I can't read

204
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,400
and Lord Branksome's charming son,

205
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,080
who's to be flung at Mary,
presumably.

206
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,960
When it comes to cousin Mary,

207
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:09,240
she's quite capable of doing
her own flinging, I assure you.

I couldn't find
her britches anywhere,

211
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,920
so I asked Mr Bates.

00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,440
He looked among
His Lordship's riding clothes.

213

There they were.

I only hope to God
I've got everything.

You should get that brushed.

225
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:09,440
He won't be up for another
half an hour, now what is it?

226
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,440
I suppose I've just realised
that it's not going to happen.

I doubt I'll leave here
before I'm 60.

00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,160
She likes to be in at the kill.

316
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,480
Where shall we go next?

317
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,040
Not home? Not yet.

318
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:45,240
We've time for one more, at least,
before we lose the light.

319
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,280
I underestimated your enthusiasm.

320
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,440
Come on.

321
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,560
(LAUGHTER)

322
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,720
Is that one mine?

323
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,360
Home is the hunter,
home from the hill.

324
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,560
Heavens, you have been in the wars.

325
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,760
Papa, this is Mr Pamuk.

326
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,480
My father, Lord Grantham.
How do you do, milord?

327
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,160
Did you have a good day?
Couldn't have been better.

328
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:20,120
This is Thomas, sir.
He'll be looking after you.

329
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,200
You remember Mr Napier.

330
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,440
Of course. How are you? So kind of
you to have us, Lady Grantham.

331
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,280
And this is Mr Pamuk.

332
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,600
How do you do? Milady.

333
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,320
Well, what would you like?

334
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,440
Just baths, we're worn out.

335
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,160
Your cases are upstairs, sir.

336
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,920
If you'd like to follow me... Yes.

337
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,160
Well, I hope Mary hasn't left you
too exhausted, Mr Napier.

338
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,560
No.

339
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,080
He doesn't look Turkish at all.

340
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,120
He doesn't look like any Englishman
I've ever met. Worse luck.

341
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,080
I think he's beautiful.

342
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:02,520
Is there some crisis, of which
I am unaware? No, Mr Carson.

343
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,840
I cannot think of another reason
why you should congregate here.

344
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,800
No, Mr Carson.

345
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,600
Have you seen our visitor?
Quite a treat for the ladies.

346
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,280
Indeed, milord.

347
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:17,840
Are they settled in all right?
Mr Napier's valet seems competent

348
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,560
and Thomas knows what he's doing.

349
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:22,080
Why doesn't the gorgeous Turk
have his own chap?

350
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,240
Apparently his man speaks no
English,

351
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,600
so Mr Pamuk decided to leave him in
London.

352
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,480
I hope Thomas doesn't mind.
You know Thomas, milord.

353
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,280
He has to have a grumble,

354
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,360
but he cheered up
when he saw the gentleman.

355
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,040
(GROANS)

356
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,720
Bates, is anything wrong?
Nothing at all, milord.

357
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,680
Is that strap too tight?

358
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,440
Shall I adjust it, sir?

359
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:50,400
Now, I'm relying on you to see that
I go downstairs properly dressed.

360
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,920
Don't worry, sir. I've got sharp
eyes for anything out of order.

361
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:57,320
Then I put yourself entirely
in your hands. You do right, sir.

362
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,320
I should love to visit Turkey.

363
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:09,120
Yes, it's a wonderful country.

364
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,160
My man always does this. Can you...?

365
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:20,080
I'm very...attracted
to the Turkish culture.

366
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,880
Then I hope your chance will come
to sample it.

367
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,840
I hope so too.

368
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,080
You forget yourself.

369
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,160
I-I'm sorry, sir, I -

370
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:37,640
That will teach you to believe what
the English say about foreigners.

371
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,720
I ought to report you.

372
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,360
I think you must ha-
I mistook nothing.

373
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,720
But I will make you an offer.

374
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:55,840
Later tonight, I may need some help
with the geography of the house.

375
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,240
The geography? Yes.

376
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,880
I'm not sure yet, but I may wish
to pay someone a visit.

377
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
If that is the case,
you will help me.

378
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,320
And I will say nothing
of your behaviour.

379
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,040
I don't understand. Why would she
want to be a secretary?

380
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,120
She wants a different life.

381
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,200
But why?

382
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:26,040
I should far prefer to be a maid
in a large and pleasant house

383
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:29,800
than work from dawn till dusk
in a cramped and gloomy office.

384
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,880
Don't you agree, Carson?
I do, milady.

385
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,800
Why are we talking about this?
What does it matter?

386
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,760
It matters that the people that live
and work here are content.

387
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,280
Of course. We should be helping
Gwen, if that's what she wants.

388
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:47,160
I agree. Surely we must all
encourage those less fortunate

389
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,120
to improve their lot where they can.

390
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,280
Not if it isn't in their best
interests.

391
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,880
Isn't the maid a better judge of
that than we are?

392
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,840
What do you say, Mr Pamuk?

393
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,040
Should our housemaid be kept
enslaved,

394
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,120
or forced out into the world?

395
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,480
Why are you English so curious
about other people's lives?

396
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,640
If she wishes to leave, and the law
permits it, then let her go.

397
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,720
Perhaps the law should not permit it,
for the common good.

398
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,800
So you hanker for the days of
serfdom.

399
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:18,240
I hanker...for a simpler world.

400
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,280
Is that a crime?

401
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,360
I do dream of a simpler world,

402
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:25,120
as long as we can keep
our trains and our dentistry.

403
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,040
I wish I shared your enthusiasm.

404
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,560
Our dentist is horrid.
Why go to him, then?

405
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,920
He treated all of us when we were
children.

406
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:35,440
You know how the English are
about these things. Mm.

407
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,600
..success at the Grand National.

408
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,280
Yes, indeed, second.

409
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,440
Well, the next time
you feel a twinge,

410
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,480
you must come to Istanbul.

411
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,160
Wouldn't the journey be painful?

412
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,800
Sometimes we must endure
a little pain

413
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,760
in order to achieve satisfaction.

414
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,600
Lady Mary rode very well today.

415
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,600
Why did you send Lynch back?

416
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,160
I had my champions to left and
right. It was enough.

417
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,440
Did you enjoy the hunt today,
Mr Napier?

418
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,680
Mary said you had a tremendous run.

419
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:08,240
It was like something out of
a Trollope novel.

420
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,520
And what about you, Mr Pamuk?
Was your day successful?

421
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,680
Oh, yes, Lady Grantham.
I can hardly remember a better one.

422
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:23,480
Mary has more suitors tonight than
the Princess Aurora.

423
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:26,400
But will she judge them sensibly?

424
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,640
No-one's sensible at her age, nor
should they be. That's our role.

425
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,120
Well, if you'll excuse me...
Thank you.

426
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,640
Is it fun to be back in the saddle?

427
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:40,160
Yes, although I'll pay for it
tomorrow.

428
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,480
Would you ever come out with me?

429
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:47,040
Or aren't we friends enough for
that? Oh, I think it might be -

430
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:50,160
That run reminded me of a day last
month, up in Cheshire.

431
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,360
We came down the side of a hill -
Excuse me.

432
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,000
It seems we must brush up
on our powers of fascination.

433
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
I was a fool to bring him here.
Don't you like him?

434
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,520
Well, I like him very much, but so
does everyone else, unfortunately.

435
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,280
Excuse me.

436
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,960
I hope I didn't wear you out, today.

437
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,880
Not at all. I enjoyed it.

438
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,320
We must do it again.

439
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:24,000
Next time, let's take my mother.

440
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,400
She was so jealous, she made me
promise she could come with us.

441
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,200
Of course. How nice that would be.

442
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,120
What is it? Is this picture really
a Della Francesca?

443
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:42,880
I think so. The second Earl brought
back several paintings from...

444
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,880
Mr Pamuk.

445
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:51,040
Let me come to you tonight, please.
I can't think what I have said

446
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:54,160
..that has led you to believe -
I don't know when we'll meet again,

447
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,240
so let it be tonight.

448
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:00,120
Mr Pamuk...I will not repeat your
words to my father,

449
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,920
since I should hate to see you cast
out into the darkness,

450
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:05,440
but can we agree to consider them
unsaid?

451
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,640
Now, if you'll excuse me, I shall
rejoin my mother and sisters.

452
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,880
(DOOR OPENS)

453
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,320
You must be mad.

454
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,000
I am. I am in the grip of madness.

455
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,040
Please leave at once, or I'll...

456
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,000
Or you'll what?

457
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,440
I'll scream.

458
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,480
No you won't.

459
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,840
Well, I'll ring the bell, then.

460
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,080
And who's on duty now? The hall boy?

461
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:58,880
Will you let him really find a man
in your bedroom? What a story.

462
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,280
Do you have any idea
what you're asking?

463
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:04,280
I'd be ruined if they even knew
we'd had this conversation,

464
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,360
let alone if - What?

465
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:09,480
Don't worry, you'll still be
a virgin for your husband.

466
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,920
Heavens, is this a proposal?

467
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,720
Alas, no, I don't think our union
would please your family.

468
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,560
I'm afraid not.

469
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,600
Nor mine.

470
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,640
But...

471
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,600
a little imagination...

472
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,760
You wouldn't be the first.

473
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,640
You and my parents
have something in common.

474
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,320
Oh?

475
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:35,800
You believe I'm much more of a rebel
than I am.

476
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,720
Now, please go.

477
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,120
I'm not what you think I am.

478
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:46,600
If it's my mistake, if I've led you
on, I'm sorry, but...I'm not.

479
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,240
You are just what I think you are.

480
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,160
No.

481
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,200
I've never done anything.

482
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,240
Of course not.

483
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,200
One look at you would tell me that.

484
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,360
Oh, my darling.

485
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,520
Won't it hurt?

486
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,160
Is it safe?

487
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,120
Trust me.

488
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,400
He's dead. I think he's dead.

489
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,760
No, I'm sure he's dead.

490
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,480
But how?

491
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,440
We were together and...

492
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,160
He's dead.

493
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,120
In your room?

494
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,360
We've got to get him
back to his own bed. But how?

495
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,840
It's in the Bachelor's Corridor,
miles from my room.

496
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,560
Could we manage it between us?

497
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:19,200
He weighs a ton.
I could hardly shift him at all.

498
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,920
We'll need at least one other.
What about Bates?

499
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,960
He couldn't lift him.

500
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:26,280
William can't keep a secret.

501
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,000
And Thomas wouldn't try to.

502
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,680
We've got to do something.

503
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:34,200
Who else has as much to lose as you
if it ever gets out?

504
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,880
Not Papa.

505
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,920
Please don't say Papa. I couldn't
bear the way he'd look at me.

506
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:41,280
No, not His Lordship.

507
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,480
What happened? I don't know.

508
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,600
A heart attack, I suppose,
or a stroke or...

509
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,720
He was alive and suddenly, he cried
out, and then he was dead.

510
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,320
But why was he here at all?

511
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,280
Did he force himself on you?

512
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:11,720
Well...we can talk about that later.

513
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:15,480
Now...we must decide what to do
for the best.

514
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,440
There's only one thing we can do.

515
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:23,160
I couldn't. It's not possible.

516
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:27,480
If you don't, we will figure in
a scandal of such magnitude,

517
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:30,400
it will never be forgotten until
long after we're both dead.

518
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,720
I'll be ruined, Mama.
Ruined and notorious.

519
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,800
A laughing stock, a social pariah.

520
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,240
Is that what you want for
your eldest daughter?

521
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,400
Is it what you want for the family?

522
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,120
We must cover him up.

523
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,760
(Hurry.
The servants will be up soon.)

524
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,720
(We've got time.)

525
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,800
(Mama.) (Sorry.)

526
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:34,000
I can't make his eyes stay shut.

527
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,960
Leave that and come away.

528
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,960
He was so beautiful.

529
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,000
Her Ladyship's right.

530
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,200
We must get back to our rooms.

531
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,360
I feel that I can never forgive what
you have put me through this night.

532
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:57,560
I hope, in time, I will come to be
more merciful,

533
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,600
but I doubt it.

534
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,680
You won't tell Papa?

535
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:05,600
Since it would probably kill him and
certainly ruin his life, I will not,

536
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,760
but I keep the secret for his sake,
not for yours.

537
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,800
Yes, Mama.

538
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,760
Anna.

539
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,400
I will not insult you

540
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:19,280
by asking that you also conceal
Lady Mary's shame.

541
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,840
Let us go.

542
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,920
(DOOR CLOSES)

543
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,800
(KNOCKS ON DOOR)

544
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,120
I imagine you've heard
what's happened?

545
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,160
Yes.

546
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,200
A terrible thing.

547
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,240
Awful.

548
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,200
Ghastly for your parents.

549
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,800
I don't suppose I shall ever
make it up to them.

550
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,840
Well, it wasn't your fault.

551
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,880
I brought him here.

552
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,800
If it isn't my fault, whose is it?

553
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:26,120
I was wondering if you might
show me the gardens before I go.

554
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,800
We could get some fresh air.

555
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:30,400
I won't, if you'll forgive me.

556
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,560
I ought to stay and help Mama.

557
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,440
Of course.

558
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,480
I'm so sorry about all this.

559
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,360
I told your father I'll deal with
the Embassy.

560
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,680
They won't be any more annoyance
for you.

561
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,640
Thank you.

562
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,360
Actually, he was a terribly nice
fellow.

563
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,000
I wish you could have known him
better.

564
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,720
I took him on as a duty,

565
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,040
but I liked him more and more
the longer I knew him.

566
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,480
Perhaps you saw his qualities
for yourself.

567
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,760
(WEEPS)

568
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,600
(Which obviously you did.)

569
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,880
I had an uncle who went like that.

570
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:24,160
Finished his cocoa, closed his book
and fell back dead on the pillow.

571
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:27,480
I don't think Mr Pamuk bothered
with cocoa much, or books.

572
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,440
He had other interests.

573
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,800
I meant you can go just like that,
with no reason.

574
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:34,680
That's why you should treat every
day as if it were your last

575
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:37,640
Well, we couldn't criticise Mr Pamuk
where that's concerned.

576
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:40,200
What do you mean? Nothing.

577
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,160
Careful with that.

578
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,040
Gwen, are you busy? Your Ladyship?

579
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,680
I saw this.
It came out yesterday. Look.

580
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:59,600
It's for a secretary at a new firm
in Thirsk.

581
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:03,040
See? What, I don't understand.

582
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,720
How did you know? That you wanted
to leave? Carson told my father.

583
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,800
And you don't mind? Why should I?

584
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,880
I think it's terrific that people
make their own lives,

585
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,720
especially women.

586
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:16,280
Write to them today and name me as
your reference.

587
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,520
I can give it
without ever specifying

588
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,880
precisely what your work here
has been.

589
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,840
Milady?

590
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,960
Thank you.

591
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,200
Lady Grantham.

592
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,280
I've come to say goodbye.

593
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:41,080
They're bringing the car round,
to take me to the station.

594
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,120
Have you said goodbye to Mary?

595
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:45,080
I have.

596
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:48,560
Will we be seeing you here again?

597
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:52,200
Nothing would give me more pleasure,
but I'm a little busy at the moment.

598
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:58,400
I wonder if I might risk
embarrassing you?

599
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,840
I should like to make myself clear.

600
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,960
The truth is, Lady Grantham,
I am not a vain man.

601
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,120
I do not consider myself
a very interesting person.

602
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:13,480
But I feel it's important that
my future wife should think me so.

603
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:16,120
A woman who finds me boring could
never love me,

604
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:18,720
and I believe marriage should be
based on love.

605
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,960
(CHUCKLES) At least, at the start.

606
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,640
Thank you for your faith in me,
Mr Napier.

607
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,600
Your instincts do you credit.

608
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,920
Good luck to you.

609
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,960
Did Mr Napier get off all right?
He did, milord.

610
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:41,320
And poor Mr Pamuk has been taken
care of?

611
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:44,760
We got Grassbys from Thirsk
in the end.

612
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:47,680
They're very good and they didn't
mind coming out on a Sunday.

613
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,800
Is everyone all right downstairs?

614
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,880
Well, you know...

615
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,880
He was a handsome stranger from
foreign parts one minute,

616
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,640
the next,
he was as dead as a doornail.

617
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,280
It's bound to be a shock.

618
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,360
Of course, upstairs or down.

619
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:05,320
It's been horrid for the ladies,
and for the female staff, I expect.

620
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:08,320
It's particularly hard
on the younger maids.

621
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,280
Indeed.

622
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:13,320
Don't let the footmen be too coarse
in front of them.

623
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,160
Thomas likes to show off,

624
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,800
but we must have a care
for feminine sensibilities -

625
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,200
they are finer and more fragile
than our own.

626
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:39,940
Mr Bates?

627
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:45,820
I am going to have to insist that
you tell me what is the matter.

628
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:48,540
I thought it was for Mr Carson
to give me orders.

629
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:51,620
Mr Carson's no better than any other
man when it comes to illness.

630
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:53,900
Now tell me what it is
and I'll see what I can do.

631
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:55,900
It's nothing, truly.

632
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:58,740
I've twisted my bad leg and walked
on it too soon.

633
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:00,820
It'll be fine in a day or two.

634
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:03,460
Well, if it isn't,
I'm sending for the doctor.

635
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:11,020
The Dowager Countess.

636
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:13,060
Oh, my dears.

637
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:15,100
Is it really true?

638
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:17,140
I can't believe it.

639
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:19,700
Last night, he looked so well.

640
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:23,580
Of course, it would happen to
a foreigner. It's typical.

641
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:25,300
Don't be ridiculous.

642
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:27,060
I'm not being ridiculous.

643
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:30,940
No Englishman would dream of dying
in someone else's house.

644
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:33,900
Especially someone they didn't even
know.

645
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:37,060
Oh, Granny, even the English aren't
in control of everything.

646
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:40,260
I hope we're in control of something,
if only ourselves.

647
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:42,340
But we're not. Don't you see that?

648
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:44,540
We're not in control of
anything at all.

649
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:50,220
Edith, go and tell Mary
to come back at once

650
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:52,260
and apologise to her grandmother.

651
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:54,060
No, leave her alone.

652
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:56,180
She's had a shock. We all have.

653
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:58,220
Just let her rest.

654
00:38:58,220 --> 00:38:59,980
(DOOR OPENS)

655
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:02,060
Oh, just the ticket.

656
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:06,060
Nanny always said sweet tea was
the thing for frayed nerves.

657
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:09,980
Though why it has to be sweet,
I couldn't tell you.

658
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:15,020
What did you mean, Mr Pamuk lived
each day as if it were his last?

659
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,660
What I said.

660
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:18,700
Well, how did you know?

661
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:21,100
Can't keep William waiting. Gangway.

662
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:23,220
I'll be asking
the same question later,

663
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:25,140
so you'd better have an answer ready.

664
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:31,780
Daisy, where have you hidden the
flour? I can't see it anywhere.

665
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:33,820
It's just there, Mrs Patmore.

666
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:37,300
Well, fetch it to me, then.
You're all in a daze today.

667
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:44,780
Do you think we should have gone up
there?

668
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:46,900
To see how they are?

669
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:49,700
I sent a note, but I thought I'd be
in the way. Why?

670
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:54,660
I thought Mary was rather struck
with him last night, didn't you?

671
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:57,140
Well, it must have been frightful
for all of them,

672
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:59,060
but there it is.

673
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:01,220
In the midst of life, we are in
death.

674
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:08,060
I suppose Mr Napier will have to
manage everything.

675
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:10,180
I suppose he will.

676
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:12,420
We all thought him a very nice
gentleman.

677
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:14,500
Yes, he is nice.

678
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:16,980
Will we be seeing a lot of him?

679
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:20,180
I don't expect so, no.

680
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:23,580
Because we rather hoped Lady Mary
might have taken a shine to him.

681
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:26,900
Seems not.

682
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:28,980
Oh, well.

683
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:32,140
There are plenty more fish in
the sea than ever came out of it.

684
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:50,980
Are you looking for something?
Lady Mary?

685
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:55,980
I just wanted to make sure the room
had been tidied up,

686
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:59,180
after the...
after the people had left.

687
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:05,420
Life can be terribly unfair,
can't it?

688
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:07,300
It certainly can.

689
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:10,700
Everything seems so golden,
one minute,

690
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:12,700
then turns to ashes, the next.

691
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:15,780
Can I ask you a question, Carson?

692
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:21,260
Have you ever felt your life was
somehow...slipping away...

693
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:25,220
..and there was nothing you could do
to stop it?

694
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:28,420
I think everyone feels that,
at one time or another.

695
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:30,620
The odd thing is, I feel...

696
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:34,380
..for the first time, really,

697
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:37,580
I understand what it is
to be happy.

698
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:41,660
It's just I know that I won't be.

699
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:45,020
Oh, don't say that, milady.

700
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:49,260
Don't raise the white flag
quite yet.

701
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:51,940
You can still be mistress of
Downton.

702
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:55,740
Old Lady Grantham hasn't given up
the fight, not by a long chalk.

703
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:57,780
Oh, that?

704
00:41:57,780 --> 00:41:59,740
I wasn't even thinking about that.

705
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:03,740
And, if I may say so, milady,
you're still very young.

706
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,640
Am I?

707
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,440
I don't feel it.

708
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,640
We're all behind you, milady.

709
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:14,440
The staff, we're all on your side.

710
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,480
Thank you, Carson.

711
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,960
You've always been so kind to me.

712
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,200
Always.

713
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:27,040
From when I was quite a little girl.

714
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:29,080
Why is that?

715
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:32,400
Even a butler has his favourites,
milady.

716
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,120
Does he?

717
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,920
I'm glad.

718
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:44,280
- Lady Mary? Oh, milady. I thought...
- Carson and I were just making sure

719
00:42:44,281 --> 00:42:46,600
that everything was shipshape and
Bristol fashion,

720
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,600
and it is.

721
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,520
Good night, Carson.

722
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,480
Good night, milady.

723
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:09,960
Of all the men on earth,
I mean, he looked so fit.

724
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:12,200
Dr Clarkson said it was
a heart attack.

725
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:16,120
Did you see any signs? I didn't have
much chance to study the gentleman.

726
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:19,200
You don't suppose there's anything
sinister in it, do you?

727
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:22,200
Every day, the papers warn us of
German spies,

728
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:25,400
and they did say his presence was
essential for peace in Albania...

729
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:27,480
I doubt it, milord.

730
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:31,240
Anyone wanting to poison his food
would have to get past Mrs Patmore.

731
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:33,000
Blimey, that's a thought.

732
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,960
Unless, of course,
she's a spy herself.

733
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,920
(GROANS)

734
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,360
I wish you'd tell me what's wrong,
Bates.

735
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,920
You'll be in no trouble.
I only want to help.

736
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:45,560
I know that, Your Lordship,
and I am grateful,

737
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:47,600
but there is nothing
I need help with.

738
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:55,440
Good morning, Mrs Hughes.
Good morning, milord.

739
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,400
I wonder if you...

740
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:03,240
(GRUNTS)

741
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:12,720
Now, will you kindly explain
what in heaven's name is going on?

742
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:15,880
I'm perfectly well, Mrs Hughes.
A bit stiff, that's all.

743
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:22,440
Just so long as you know,
I'm not leaving until you tell me.

744
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:37,960
I hope you have a strong stomach.

745
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:54,080
Oh, my God.

746
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,080
Cousin Mary?

747
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:06,720
Hello.

748
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,920
Are we expecting you?
No, but I wanted to see you.

749
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:12,320
I looked for you yesterday,
at church.

750
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:14,440
I wasn't feeling up to it.

751
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:17,560
None of us were.

752
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:19,520
It must have been a horrible shock.

753
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,440
Yes.

754
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:26,200
And he seemed a nice fellow. He was.

755
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:29,480
A very nice fellow.

756
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:32,120
So, if there's anything I can do...

757
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:34,880
..please ask.

758
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:40,440
There isn't, but thank you.

759
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,600
Well, here goes.

760
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:58,880
Do you not think
we ought to say a few words?

761
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:02,120
What? 'Good riddance'?

762
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:04,760
That and your promise.

763
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:08,680
Very well.

764
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:11,720
I promise I will never again
try to cure myself.

765
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:15,320
I will spend my life happily
as the butt of others' jokes,

766
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:17,000
and I will never mind them.

767
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,320
We all carry scars, Mr Bates,
inside or out.

768
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:23,520
You're no different to
the rest of us, remember that.

769
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,560
I will try to.

770
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:27,520
That I do promise.

771
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,840
Good riddance!

772
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,240
So he definitely went in?
I saw him walk through the door.

773
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:43,800
But you don't know
if he went back to his own room?

774
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:46,920
Yes, I do, cos I was the one
who found him there the next day.

775
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:50,200
What I mean is you don't know if
he went back under his own steam.

776
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:52,960
I suppose not, but how else
would he have done it?

777
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:55,160
That's what they call
the big question.

778
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:01,200
I don't wanna get in any trouble
over this.

779
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,520
Don't worry, you won't.

780
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:06,560
Your secret's safe wi' me.

781
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,320
ROBERT: You could stay if you
married Matthew.

782
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:14,000
I'm a lost soul to you.

783
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,280
What chance did he have,
against a champion?

784
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:18,920
You're hiding behind him,
