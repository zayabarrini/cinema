I'll take it up there now.

None of them will be up for hours,

I'd like to sleep until I woke up

Yes, Mrs Patmore.

breakfast? Yes, Mrs Patmore.

Yes, Mrs Patmore.

All lit, Mrs Patmore.

I didn't like to touch the curtains
with my dirty hands. Quite right too.

Why didn't you put the lights on?
I daren't.

It's not the devil's handiwork.

Yes, Mrs Hughes. Good.

One of his partners is in New York.
Yes?

It seems James and Patrick
were on board.

What? But they weren't going over
till May.

95
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:54,640
Then they changed their plans.
They're on the passenger list.

Thank you, O'Brien.
That'll be all for the moment.

00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,680
Doesn't look like it.
What?

99
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,520
Neither of them?

100
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:14,960
You must tell Mary.

101
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,440
She can't hear about it
from anyone else.

102

Neither were picked up.
That's what he said.

Mr Crawley and Mr Patrick?
That's what he said.

Her Ladyship was the colour
of this cloth.

105
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,680
Well, it's a terrible shame
if it's true.

106
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,320
It's worse than a shame.
It's a complication.

107
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,320
What do you mean?
What do you think?

108
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:48,560
Mr Crawley was his Lordship's cousin
and heir to the title.

109
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,640
I thought Lady Mary was the heir.

110
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,400
She's a girl, stupid.
Girls can't inherit.

111
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,800
But now Mr Crawley's dead,
and Mr Patrick was his only son.

112
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,880
So what happens next?
It's a dreadful thing.

00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,480
I'm John Bates, the new valet.

start tonight.

But how can you manage? Don't worry
about that. I can manage.

125
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,600
Because we've all got our own work
to do. I can manage.

I hope your journey
was satisfactory?

since Mr Watson left.

for Mr Bates's arrival?

137
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,240
I've put him in Mr Watson's old room,

138
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,360
though he left it in quite a state,
I can tell you.

But what about all them stairs?

140
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:28,440
I keep telling you, I can manage.
Of course you can.

141
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:32,720
Thomas, take Mr Bates to his room
and show him where he'll be working.

142

Thank you, everyone.

Well, I can't see that lasting long.

Thank you, Miss O'Brien.

145

Oh, yes.

146
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,240
I shall be comfortable here.

147
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,000
Does this mean I'll have to go into
full mourning?

My first cousin and his son...

..are almost certainly dead.

150

We will all be in mourning.

151
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,880
No. I mean with the other thing.

152
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,800
After all, it wasn't official.

153
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,960
If you're saying you do not wish
to mourn Patrick as a fiance,

154
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:54,320
that is up to you. Well, no-one
knew about it outside the family.

155
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,200
I repeat, it is up to you.
Well, that's a relief.

156
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,200
There's some cedar-lined cupboards
in the attic

157
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,400
for things that aren't often worn -
travelling clothes and such.

158
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,240
Mr Watson used them to rotate
the summer and winter stuff.

159
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,880
I'll show you later.
What about studs and links?

160
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,080
Do I choose them or does he?

161
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,640
Lay them out unless he asks for
something in particular.

162
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,720
These for a ball,
these for an ordinary dinner,

163
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,800
these only in London.

164
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,080
I'll get the hang of it.
Yeah, you'll have to.

165
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,160
Snuff boxes. He collects them.

166
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,240
Beautiful.

167
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,360
Funny, our job, isn't it?
What do you mean?

168
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,560
The way we live with all this.
A pirate's hoard within our reach.

169
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,480
But none of it's ours, is it?

170
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,000
No, none of it's ours.

171
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,960
I can't believe I've been passed
over for Long John Silver.

172
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,320
You should have spoken up
when you had the chance.

173
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,000
Don't make the same mistake
next time.

174
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,880
Who says there'll be a next time?

175
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,120
Is this a public holiday
no-one's told me of?

176
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,840
She was certainly reluctant
to go into mourning.

177
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,760
Well, she'll have to. We all will.

178
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,360
O'Brien's sorting out my black now

179
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,520
and I've told Anna to see what
the girls have that still fits.

180
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,280
Of course, this alters everything.

181
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:50,400
You won't try to deny it? You must
challenge the entail now, surely?

182
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:54,240
Can't we at least wait until we know
they're dead before we discuss it?

183
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,960
Don't talk as if I'm not
broken-hearted, because I am.

184
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,960
Of course, I have never understood
why this estate must go

185
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:05,400
to whomever inherits your title.
My dear, I don't make the law.

186
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,320
What is it? The Dowager Countess
is in the drawing room.

187
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,960
I'll come now.
She asked for Lady Grantham.

188
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,600
I wonder what I've done wrong
this time.

189
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,720
And the new valet has arrived,
my Lord.

190
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,200
Has he? Hm... Thank you, Carson.

191
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,280
(CLEARS THROAT)

192
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,560
What is it?

193
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:27,280
I'm not entirely sure that he will
prove equal to the task,

194
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,640
but your Lordship will be the judge
of that.

195
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,280
I'd better go.

196
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,920
Tell her about James and Patrick.
She won't have heard.

197
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,800
Of course I've heard!
Why else would I be here?

198
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,840
Robert didn't want you to read about
it in a newspaper and be upset.

199
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,400
He flatters me.
I'm tougher than I look.

200
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,960
I'm very sorry about poor Patrick,
of course.

201
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,080
He was a nice boy.
We were all so fond of him.

202
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:01,800
But I never cared for James.

203
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,840
He was too like his mother and
a nastier woman never drew breath.

204
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,360
Will you stay for some luncheon?
Thank you.

205
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,400
I'll let Carson know.
I've already told him.

206
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,280
Shall we sit down?

207
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,360
Do you know the new heir?
Only that there is one.

208
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:26,400
He's Robert's third cousin
once removed.

209
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,720
I have never, to my knowledge,
set eyes on him.

210
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,680
Of course, if your late husband
hadn't forced me to sign
that absurd act of legal theft!

211
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:35,720
My dear, I didn't come here
to fight.

212
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:39,320
Lord Grantham wanted to protect
the estate.

213
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:42,840
It never occurred to him that you
wouldn't have a son. Well, I didn't.

214
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,800
No, you did not.

215
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,560
But when Patrick had married Mary

216
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,920
and your grandson been hailed
as master,

217
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,840
honour would have been satisfied.

218
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,160
Unfortunately, now...

219
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,640
Now a complete unknown has the right
to pocket my money,

220
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,600
along with the rest of the swag!

221
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:05,600
The problem is, saving your dowry
would break up the estate.

222
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,880
The problem is, saving your dowry
would break up the estate.

223
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,880
It would be the ruin of everything
Robert's given his life to.

224
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:13,280
And he knows this?
Well, if he doesn't, he will.

225
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,560
Then there's no answer.

226
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:19,800
Yes, there is,
and it's a simple one.

227
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,840
The entail must be smashed

228
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,760
in its entirety

229
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:28,160
and Mary recognised
as heiress of all.

230
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,440
There's nothing we can do
about the title.

231
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:34,040
No, she can't have the title.

232
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,720
But she can have your money...

233
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,560
and the estate.

234
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:42,800
I didn't run Downton for 30 years

235
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,040
to see it go, lock, stock and
barrel,

236
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,680
to a stranger from God knows where.

237
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,440
Are we to be friends, then?

238
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,840
We are allies, my dear.

239
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,800
Which can be a good deal
more effective.

240
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,320
Downton is a great house, Mr Bates,

241
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,520
and the Crawleys are a great family.

242
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,760
We live by certain standards

243
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,480
and those standards can at first
seem daunting. Of course.

244
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:19,080
If you find yourself tongue-tied
in the presence of his Lordship,

245
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:22,160
I can only assure you that his
manners and grace

246
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,240
will soon help you to perform your
duties to the best of your ability.

247
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,600
I know.

248
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,200
Bates! My dear fellow!

249
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,360
I do apologise. I should have
realised you'd all be at luncheon.

250
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,760
Not at all, my Lord.
Please, sit. Sit, everyone.

251
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:37,960
I just want to say a quick hello
to my old comrade-in-arms.

252
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:41,480
Bates, my dear man.
Welcome to Downton.

253
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:44,720
Thank you, sir.

254
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,160
I'm so sorry to have disturbed
you all. Please forgive me.

255
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,400
You never asked.

256
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:05,300
Thomas, take that up!

257
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,620
Leave it, Daisy! He's a grown man.

258
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:10,060
I suppose he can lift a meat pie.

259
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:12,300
Now, put that apple tart
in the lower oven.

260
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:18,020
Oh, and take that away! Mr Lynch
shouldn't have left it there!

261
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,700
What is it?
Salt of sorrel.

262
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,380
I asked him for some to clean
the brass pots.

263
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:25,020
So, put it somewhere careful.
It's poison.

264
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:30,700
It seems like a lot of food, when
you think they're all in mourning.

265
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:34,740
Nothing makes you hungrier
or more tired than grief.

266
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:37,460
When my sister died,
God rest her soul,

267
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:40,940
I ate my way through four platefuls
of sandwiches at one sitting

268
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:43,340
and slept round the clock.
Did it make you feel better?

269
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:47,260
Not much, but it passed the time.

270
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:50,420
Oh, my Lord, what was this chopped
egg supposed to be sprinkled on?

271
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:54,380
Was it the chicken?
It was. Take it upstairs now.

272
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:57,300
I can't go in the dining room!
I should think not!

273
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,980
Find Thomas or William
and tell them what to do.

274
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:03,220
For heaven's sake, get a move on,
before they get back from church!

275
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:08,540
Well, we've given them a memorial
in London and a memorial here.

276
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:12,580
I prefer memorials to funerals.
They're less dispiriting.

277
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:15,540
We could hardly have held a funeral
without the bodies.

278
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:17,540
I gather they're putting up a stone

279
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:20,060
to mark those whose bodies
were never found.

280
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:22,620
In fact, I hear the Canadians are
making quite a thing

281
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:26,260
of the Titanic cemetery. I'm
surprised at the number they found.

282
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:28,300
You'd think the sea would have taken
more of them.

283
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:34,620
So, Murray, what have you to tell me
about the lucky Mr Crawley?

284
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,940
Nothing too terrible, I hope.

285
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:40,500
I've only made a few enquiries but,
no, there's not much to alarm you.

286
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:45,500
Matthew Crawley is a solicitor,
based in Manchester. Manchester?

287
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,340
His special field is company law.

288
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:51,900
His mother is alive
and he lives with her.

289
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:54,220
His father, obviously, is not.
He was a doctor.

290
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:56,540
I know.

291
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:59,420
It does seem odd that my third
cousin should be a doctor.

292
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:01,500
There are worse professions.

293
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,380
Indeed.

294
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:12,100
(BUSY CHATTER)

295
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,580
Do me a favour. This must be
sprinkled on the chicken.

296
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:17,020
Isn't there more to go up?
Please! It won't take a moment!

297
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,340
Go on then, give it here.

298
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:22,660
We ought to talk about the business
of the entail.

299
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:27,180
As you know, on your death the heir
to the title inherits everything,

300
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:27,300
As you know, on your death the heir
to the title inherits everything,

301
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:30,940
except for the sums set aside for
your daughters and your widow.

302
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:34,260
Yes. Owing to the terms of
her settlement,

303
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:38,180
this will include the bulk of your
wife's fortune.

304
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:39,940
It has been our sole topic of
conversation

305
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:41,620
since the day the ship went down.

306
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:44,660
Of course, it must seem horribly
unjust to Lady Grantham,

307
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:46,500
but that is how the law stands.

308
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,380
Is there really no way to detach
her money from the estate?

309
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,900
Even to me, it seems absurd.

310
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:55,580
Your father tied the knots pretty
tight. I'd say it's unbreakable.

311
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,140
I see.

312
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:01,300
Really, Edith. Do you have to put on
such an exhibition?

313
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,380
She's not.

314
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:06,380
I was supposed to be engaged to him,
for heaven's sake, not you,

315
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:09,180
and I can control myself.
Then you should be ashamed.

316
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:13,620
Don't tell me you've not sent up
the egg yet!

317
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,620
Oh God, help me!
Please, God, help me!

318
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:23,340
What on earth's the matter?
Run upstairs to the dining room

319
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,460
and find William, I beg you!
I can't do it now.

320
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:27,500
You've got to!
I'll be hanged if you don't!

321
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,420
What?
WILLIAM: Daisy? Is that you?

322
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:32,980
Is it the chicken in a sauce
or the chicken with sliced oranges?

323
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:35,660
Oh, thank you, blessed and merciful
Lord! Thank you!

324
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:39,860
It's the chicken in the sauce.

325
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:42,740
I'll never do anything sinful again,
I swear it! Not till I die!

326
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:50,220
Mr Murray, how lovely to see you.
Do come in.

327
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:53,180
You're very kind, Lady Grantham,
but I must get back to London.

328
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:55,860
But you'll stay for luncheon?
Thank you, but no.

329
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:57,740
I'll eat on the train.

330
00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:01,580
In fact, if you'd be so good as to
ask for the motor to be brought
round?

331
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:04,660
But didn't you want the afternoon
to talk things through?

332
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:08,020
I think we've said everything
we have to say, haven't we, my Lord?

333
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:10,940
For the time being, yes.
Thank you, Murray.

334
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:13,020
It's given me a good
deal to think about.

335
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:19,060
Mary, try to get everyone
into the dining room.

336
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:22,300
Edith, make sure old Lord Minterne
sits down.

337
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,580
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
Mm-hm?

338
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:31,700
They've all gone?
They have, thank the Lord.

339
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:36,100
What about the lawyer?
He was the first away.

340
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,140
Didn't even stay for the luncheon.

341
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:40,660
I wish they'd make their minds up.

342
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:42,980
Gwen's put clean sheets
on the Blue Room bed.

343
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:45,140
Now she'll just have to strip it
again.

344
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:47,500
Can't you leave it
for the next guest?

345
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,780
Well, only if you don't tell.
(WRY CHUCKLE)

346
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:55,660
So, has it all been settled?

347
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:58,340
No, I don't know if anything's been
settled.

348
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:01,380
There's a fellow in Manchester with
claims to the title, I gather,

349
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:03,900
but it's all a long way
from settled.

350
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:07,100
You mustn't take it personally.

351
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:09,060
Oh, I do take it personally,
Mrs Hughes.

352
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:12,420
I can't stand by and watch our
family threatened

353
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:15,300
with the loss of all they hold dear.
They're not OUR family.

354
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,220
Well, they're all the family
I've got!

355
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:24,340
I beg your pardon.

356
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:33,580
Do you...ever wish
you'd gone another way?

357
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,380
Worked in a shop or a factory?

358
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:43,340
Had a wife and children?

359
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:45,260
Do you?

360
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:49,980
I don't know.

361
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:52,140
Maybe. Sometimes.

362
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,500
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

363
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:58,900
William's laid tea in the library,
but her Ladyship hasn't come down.

364
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:02,260
She'll be tired.
Take a tray up to her bedroom.

365
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:04,780
Is Thomas back?
Not yet, Mr Carson.

366
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:11,500
He asked if he could run down
the village. I didn't see why not.

367
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:40,300
It's iniquitous. They can't expect
you to sit by silent

368
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,500
as your fortune is stolen away.

369
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,980
Can't they?
His Lordship'd never let it happen.

370
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:50,540
How's Bates working out?
Well...

371
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:53,820
I don't like to say.

372
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:57,420
Only, it seems unkind to criticise
a man for an affliction, my Lady.

373
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:00,220
Even if it means he can't do his job.

374
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:10,500
How are you settling in?

375
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:14,180
Very well...I think. Unless your
Lordship feels differently.

376
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:16,380
No complaints?

377
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:18,980
If I had any, I should take them
to Mr Carson, my Lord, not you.

378
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:22,340
You're probably right.

379
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:26,900
And the house hasn't worn you out
with the endless stairs and so on?

380
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:30,140
I like the house, my Lord.
I like it as a place to work.

381
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:34,900
What happened?
It's only the old wound.

382
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:39,260
After I left the army, I had a spot
of bother

383
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:41,540
and just when I'd got through that,
about a year ago,

384
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:43,460
my knee started playing up.

385
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:45,900
A bit of shrapnel got left in
or something, and it moved.

386
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:48,580
But it's fine. It's not a problem.

387
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:51,340
And you'd let me know if you felt
it was all too much for you?

388
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:53,980
I would. But it won't be.

389
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:57,980
Thomas.

390
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:01,260
And where have you been?
The village.

391
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:02,980
To send a telegram,
if you must know.

392
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,860
Oh, pardon me for living.

393
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,900
Well, Murray didn't stay long.

394
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:19,980
Does her Ladyship know
how they left it? No.

395
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:23,420
They talked it all through
on the way back from the church.

396
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:25,500
If I was still his valet,
I'd get it out of him.

397
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,620
Bates won't say a word.

398
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:30,060
He will not.

399
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:33,020
I'd bet you a tanner he's a spy in
the other direction.

400
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:37,980
I wanted that job. We were all right
together, his Lordship and me.

401
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:40,820
Then be sure to get your foot in
the door when Bates is gone.

402
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:45,580
We can't get rid of him just because
he talks behind our backs.

403
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:49,020
There's more than one way
to skin a cat.

404
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:51,140
Perhaps she misunderstood.

405
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:53,340
No, it was quite plain.

406
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:55,940
O'Brien told her Bates can't do
the job properly.

407
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:59,580
Why was he taken on?
Oh, he was Lord Grantham's batman

408
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:02,820
when he was fighting the Boers.
I know that, but even so!

409
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:04,740
I think it's romantic.
I don't!

410
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:06,620
How can a valet do his work
if he's lame?

411
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:08,820
He's not VERY lame.

412
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:11,660
There.
Anything else before I go down?

413
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:13,540
No. That's it. Thank you.

414
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,260
Oh, I hate black.

415
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:25,860
It's not for long.

416
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:28,420
Ma says we can go into
half-mourning next month,

417
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:30,820
and to colours by September.
Still a lot for a cousin.

418
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:32,340
But not a fiance.

419
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:40,460
He wasn't really a fiance...
No?

420
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:43,540
I thought that was what you call
a man you're going to marry.

421
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:46,940
I was only going to marry him
if nothing better turned up.

422
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:49,820
Mary, what a horrid thing to say!
Don't worry.

423
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:52,060
Edith would have taken him,
wouldn't you?

424
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,940
Yes. I'd have taken him.

425
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:57,860
If you'd given me the chance,
I'd have taken him like a shot.

426
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:03,260
I just think you should know
it's not working, Mr Carson.

427
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:05,740
Do you mean Mr Bates is lazy?

428
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:09,300
Not lazy, exactly.
But he just can't carry.

429
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:11,460
He can hardly manage his Lordship's
cases.

430
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:14,020
You saw how it was
when they went up to London.

431
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,860
He can't help with the guests'
luggage,

432
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:17,780
and as for waiting at table,
forget that.

433
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:20,740
And what do you want me to do?
It's not for me to say.

434
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:23,860
But is it fair on William
to have all the extra work?

435
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:25,980
I don't believe you'd like to think

436
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:29,340
the house was falling below
the way things ought to be.

437
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:31,100
I would not.
That's all I'm saying.

438
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:43,660
I'm going down. Coming?

439
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:46,380
In a moment. You go.

440
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:58,580
I know you're sad about Patrick,
whatever you say, I know it.

441
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:01,980
You're a darling.

442
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:07,020
But you see, I'm not as sad
as I should be.

443
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:10,420
And that's what makes me sad.

444
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:14,060
Thank you.
(DROPS BRUSH)

445
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:17,060
I'll do that.
No. No, thank you, my Lord.

446
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:18,980
I can do it.
I'm sure.

447
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:23,180
I hope so, my Lord.
I hope you are sure.

448
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:25,940
Bates, we have to be sensible.

449
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:29,060
I won't be doing you a favour in the
long run if it's too much for you.

450
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:34,100
Whatever we've been through,
it has to work.
Of course, sir. I mean, my Lord.

451
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:34,380
Whatever we've been through,
it has to work.
Of course, sir. I mean, my Lord.

452
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:37,340
Do you miss the army, Bates?
I miss a lot of things,

453
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:38,980
but you have to keep moving,
don't you?

454
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:40,900
Ha! You do, indeed.

455
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,780
I'll show you, my Lord. I promise.
I won't let you down.

456
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:46,700
We've managed so far, haven't we?

457
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:51,260
Yes, we have. Of course we have.

458
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:53,140
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

459
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:56,380
You look very nice.
Thank you, darling.

460
00:30:57,260 --> 00:31:00,260
Did Murray make matters clearer?
Yes, I'm afraid he did.

461
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:15,020
O'Brien says Bates is causing
a lot of awkwardness downstairs.

462
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:18,580
You may have to do something about
it. She's always making trouble.

463
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:22,660
Is that fair, when she hasn't
mentioned it before now?

464
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:24,900
I don't know why you listen to her.

465
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:29,460
It is quite eccentric, even for you,
to have a crippled valet.

466
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:33,100
Please, don't use that word.

467
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:36,060
Did he tell you he couldn't walk
when he made his application?

468
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:40,100
Don't exaggerate. Doesn't it strike
you as dishonest not to mention it?

469
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,300
I knew he'd been wounded.
You never said.

470
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,420
You know I don't care to talk about
all that.

471
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:46,940
I understand what it must be like,

472
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:49,180
to have fought alongside someone
in a war.

473
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:51,700
Oh, you understand that, do you?
Certainly I do.

474
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:55,900
You must form the most tremendous
bonds, even with a servant.

475
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:58,900
Really? Even with a servant?

476
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:03,060
Oh, Robert, don't catch me out.

477
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:06,700
I'm simply saying I fully see why
you want to help him. But?

478
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:10,780
But...is this the right way to employ
him for a job he can't do?

479
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:13,340
Is it any wonder if the others' noses
are put out?

480
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:15,500
I just want to give him a chance.

481
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:24,060
Mama, I'm sorry.
No-one told me you were here.

482
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:27,380
Oh dear, such a glare!

483
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:30,060
I feel as if I were on stage
at the Gaiety.

484
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:31,940
We're used to it.

485
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:35,220
I wish you'd let me install it in
the Dower House. It's so convenient.

486
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:38,460
The man who manages the generator
could look after yours as well. No.

487
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:42,420
I couldn't have electricity in
the house. I wouldn't sleep a wink.

488
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:45,700
All those vapours! Even Cora won't
have it in the bedrooms.

489
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:48,460
She did wonder about the kitchens -
I couldn't see the point.

490
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:52,860
Before anyone joins us, I'm glad of
this chance for a little talk.

491
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:59,620
I gather Murray was here today.
News travels fast.

492
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:02,420
Yes, I saw him, and he's not
optimistic

493
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:05,860
that there's anything we can do.
I refuse to believe it.

494
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:08,500
Be that as it may, it's a fact.

495
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:11,420
But to lose Cora's fortune...

496
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:15,180
Really, Mama.
You know as well as I do

497
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:18,300
that Cora's fortune is not
Cora's fortune any more!

498
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:20,820
Thanks to Papa,
it is now part of the estate

499
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:23,100
and the estate is entailed
to my heir!

500
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,740
That is it! That is all of it!

501
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:30,260
Robert, dear, I don't mean to sound
harsh... But I bet you will.

502
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:35,140
24 years ago you married Cora,
against my wishes, for her money.

503
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:40,500
Give it away now, and what was
the point of your peculiar marriage
in the first place?

504
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,580
If I were to tell you
she'd made me happy,

505
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:47,020
would that stretch belief?
It's not why you chose her.

506
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:50,500
Above all the other girls who could
have filled my shoes so easily...

507
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:54,300
If you must know, when I think of
my motives for pursuing Cora,

508
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:57,860
I'm ashamed. There's no need
to remind me of them.

509
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:01,580
Don't you care about Downton?

510
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:05,380
What do YOU think?

511
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:09,260
I've given my life to Downton.

512
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:12,620
I was born here
and I hope to die here.

513
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:15,780
I claim no career beyond the nurture
of this house and the estate.

514
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:18,340
It is my third parent
and my fourth child.

515
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:21,260
(EMOTIONAL) Do I care about it?
Yes, I do care!

516
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:26,220
I hope I don't hear sounds of
a disagreement.

517
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:29,500
Is that what they call discussion
in New York?

518
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:32,580
I'm glad you're fighting. I'm glad
somebody's putting up a fight.

519
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:34,500
You're not really fighting Granny?

520
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:39,060
Your grandmother merely wishes to do
the right thing. And so do I.

521
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:39,140
Your grandmother merely wishes to do
the right thing. And so do I.

522
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:40,980
Dinner is served, my Lady.

523
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:44,820
Does anyone else keep dreaming about
the Titanic?

524
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:47,820
I can't get it out of my mind.
Not again. Give it a rest.

525
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:50,860
Daisy, it's time to let it go.
But all them people,

526
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:53,860
freezing to death in the midnight,
icy water.

527
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:55,940
Oh, you sound like a penny dreadful.

528
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:59,420
I expect you saw worse things
in South Africa, eh, Mr Bates?

529
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:02,220
Not worse, but...pretty bad.

530
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:05,220
Did you enjoy the war?
I don't think anyone enjoys war,

531
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:08,260
but there are some good memories too.
I'm sure there are.

532
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:10,900
Mr Bates, could you hand me
that tray?

533
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:16,940
Blast!
I'll do it.

534
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:24,100
The ladies are out.
We've given them coffee

535
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:26,580
and his Lordship's taken his port
to the library.

536
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:28,900
Anna, Gwen,
go up and help clear away.

537
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:32,700
Daisy, tell Mrs Patmore
we'll eat in 15 minutes.

538
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:48,340
I keep forgetting. Does this go
next door or back to the kitchen?

539
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:51,020
Those go back, but the dessert
service and all the glasses

540
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:53,220
stay in the upstairs pantry.
Put it on here.

541
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:01,340
What is it? Her Ladyship's told him
she thinks Mr Bates ought to go.

542
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:05,980
She said to me, 'If only his Lordship
had been content with Thomas.'

543
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:07,980
Did she really?

544
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:10,420
What are you doing up here?
It's a free country.

545
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:16,740
Well, I'm going for my dinner.

546
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:19,020
You two can stay here...plotting.

547
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:34,980
So, the young Duke of Crowborough
is asking himself to stay.

548
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:35,340
So, the young Duke of Crowborough
is asking himself to stay.

549
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:38,580
And we know why.
You HOPE you know why.

550
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:40,940
That is not at all the same.

551
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:45,020
You realise the Duke thinks
Mary's prospects have altered?

552
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:49,420
I suppose so.
There's no 'suppose' about it.

553
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:51,820
Of course, this is exactly the sort
of opportunity

554
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:53,300
that will come to Mary,

555
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:55,740
if we can only get things settled
in her favour.

556
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:58,700
Is Robert coming round?
Not yet.

557
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:05,460
To him, the risk is, we'd succeed in
saving my money but not the estate.

558
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:09,100
He feels he'd be betraying his duty
if Downton were lost because of him.

559
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:14,180
Well, I'll write to Murray.
He won't say anything different.

560
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:18,220
Well, we have to start somewhere.
Our duty is to Mary.

561
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:24,340
Well, give him a date for when
Mary's out of mourning.

562
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:30,260
No-one wants to kiss a girl
in black.

563
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:35,780
Oh, do stop admiring yourself!

564
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:37,660
He's not marrying you for your looks.

565
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:42,100
That's if he wants to marry you
at all.

566
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:44,420
He will.

567
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:46,340
You look beautiful.
Thank you, Sybil.

568
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:48,180
(DOOR OPENS)
CORA: We should go down.

569
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:50,140
They'll be back from the station
at any moment.

570
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:57,620
Let's not gild the lily, dear.
(And Mary, try and look surprised.)

571
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:59,540
Are you all ready?

572
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:04,100
Very well.
We shall go out to greet them.

573
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:07,820
And me, Mr Carson?
No, Daisy, not you.

574
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:10,940
Can you manage, Mr Bates,
or would you rather wait here?

575
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:13,980
I want to go, Mr Carson.
There's no obligation
for the whole staff to go.

576
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:15,900
I'd like to be there.

577
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,980
Well, it's certainly a great day
for Downton

578
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:20,260
to welcome a duke under our roof.

579
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:25,180
Help me with the luggage.
Don't go running off.

580
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:27,620
I'll give you a hand.
I couldn't ask that, Mr Bates,

581
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:30,020
not in your condition.

582
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:33,300
How long do we have to put up
with this, Mr Carson, just so I know?

583
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:01,060
(DOG BARKS)

584
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:06,940
Welcome to Downton.

585
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:08,740
Lady Grantham,
this is so kind of you.

586
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:12,260
Not at all, Duke. We're delighted
you could spare the time.

587
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:14,780
You know my daughter Mary,
of course. Lady Mary.

588
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:17,540
And Edith. But I don't believe
you've met my youngest, Sybil.

589
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:20,980
Ah. Lady Sybil.
How do you do?

590
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:22,900
Come on in. You must be worn out.

591
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:28,100
Oh, Lady Grantham,
I have a confession to make
which I hope won't cause any bother.

592
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:31,380
My man was taken ill
just as I was leaving, so I...

593
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:34,420
Oh, well, that won't be a problem,
will it, Carson? Certainly not.

594
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:36,300
I shall look after his Grace myself.

595
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:40,340
Oh, no. I wouldn't dream of being
such a nuisance. Surely, a footman...

596
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:42,540
I remember this man.

597
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:45,060
You served me when I dined with
Lady Grantham in London.

598
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:47,700
I did, Your Grace.
Ah, there we are.

599
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:50,700
We shall do very well together,
won't we...? Thomas, your Grace.

600
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,620
Thomas...
Good.

601
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:58,580
I hope you had a pleasant journey.
Hm.

00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:04,180
Bates, are you all right?
Perfectly, my Lord. I apologise.

603
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:09,780
Mr Bates.

604
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:18,180
That's better.
Please, don't feel sorry for me.

605
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:30,740
What shall we do?
What would YOU like to do?

606
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:35,060
I think I'd rather like to go
exploring.

607
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:37,740
Certainly. Gardens or house?

608
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:40,420
Oh, house, I think.
Gardens are all the same to me.

609
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:42,940
(POLITE CHUCKLE) Very well...

610
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:45,260
We can begin in the hall,
one of the oldest - No!

611
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:47,460
Not all those drawing rooms
and libraries.

612
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:50,420
Well, what, then?

613
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:54,900
I don't know...

614
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:56,780
The secret passages and the attics.

615
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:00,780
It seems a bit odd, but...why not?

616
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:06,660
I'll just tell Mama.
No, don't tell your mama.

617
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:09,260
But there's nothing wrong in it.
No, indeed.

618
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:11,180
I'm only worried the others
will want to join us.

619
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:22,060
Mary's settling him in.

620
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:26,980
Cora, don't let Mary
make a fool of herself.

621
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:32,100
By the way, I'll be going
up to London next week.

622
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:34,900
Do you want to open the house?

623
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:37,100
No, I'll just take Bates
and stay at the club.

624
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:39,340
I won't be more than a day or two.
I see.

625
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:41,500
Are things progressing?

626
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,260
What things?

627
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:48,900
It's just a regimental dinner.

628
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:53,220
It was a pity Bates spoiled
the arrival this afternoon.

629
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:57,020
He didn't spoil anything.
He fell over.

630
00:41:57,020 --> 00:42:00,020
It was so undignified.
Carson hates that kind of thing.

631
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:03,300
I don't care what Carson thinks.
(CARSON CLEARS THROAT)

632
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:05,500
A message from the Dowager Countess,
my Lady.

633
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:08,140
She says she won't come to tea,
but she'll join you for dinner.

634
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:14,180
Look, Carson, I hope you weren't
embarrassed this afternoon.

635
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:18,420
I can assure you the Duke very much
appreciated his welcome. I'm glad.

636
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:21,540
Is Bates all right?
I think so, my Lord.

637
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,740
It must be so difficult for you,
all the same.

638
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:34,860
Don't stare.

639
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:48,420
Do you realise this is the first
time we've ever been alone?

640
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:52,820
Then you've forgotten when I pulled
you into the conservatory
at the Northbrooks'.

641
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:55,740
How sad.
No, I haven't.

642
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:59,660
It's not quite the same with 20
chaperones hiding behind every fern.

643
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:04,340
And are you pleased to be alone
with me, my Lady?

644
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:08,380
Oh, dear. If I answer truthfully,
you'll think me rather forward.

645
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:19,740
I don't think we should pry.
It feels rather...disrespectful.

646
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:23,060
Nonsense.
It's your father's house, isn't it?

647
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:25,220
You've a right to know what goes on
in it.

648
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:27,340
Where does this lead?
To the men's quarters,

649
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:29,500
with the lock on the women's side.

650
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:31,500
Only Mrs Hughes is allowed
to turn it.

651
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:33,540
(TURNS DOOR HANDLE) Mrs Hughes...

652
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:35,420
and you.

653
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:47,940
In here?
A footman, I imagine.

654
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:58,980
Should you do that?
Why not?

655
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:03,260
I'm making a study on the genus
'footman'.

656
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:05,820
I seek to know the creature's ways.
(CHUCKLES)

657
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:08,700
(DOOR BANGS)
Someone's coming!

658
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:18,500
Can I help you, my Lady?
We were just exploring.

659
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:23,780
Did you want Thomas, your Grace?

660
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:27,500
No. As Lady Mary said,
we've just been exploring.

661
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:34,940
Would you care to explore my room,
my Lady?

662
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:37,420
Of course not, Bates.
I'm sorry to have bothered you.

663
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:40,060
We were just going down.

664
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:52,420
Why did you apologise to that man?
It's not his business what we do.

665
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:55,940
I always apologise when I'm in
the wrong. It's a habit of mine.

666
00:44:57,540 --> 00:45:00,660
The plain fact is, Mr Bates,
through no fault of his own,

667
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:04,700
is not able to fulfil
the extra duties expected of him.

668
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:09,060
He can't lift,
he can't serve at table,

669
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:11,740
he's dropping things
all over the place.

670
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:15,300
On a night like tonight,
he should act as a third footman.

671
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:20,100
As it is, my Lord, we may have to
have a maid in the dining room.

672
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:20,340
As it is, my Lord, we may have to
have a maid in the dining room.

673
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:23,460
Cheer up, Carson. There are worse
things happening in the world.

674
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:26,020
Not worse than a maid
serving a duke.

675
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:32,260
So you're quite determined?

676
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:36,900
It's a hard decision, your Lordship,
a very hard decision,

677
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,300
but the honour of Downton
is at stake.

678
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:41,980
Don't worry, Carson.

679
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:45,580
I know all about hard decisions when
it comes to the honour of Downton,

680
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:47,660
don't I, boy?

681
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:54,940
William, you mustn't let Thomas
take advantage.

682
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:57,100
He's only a footman, same as you.

683
00:45:57,100 --> 00:45:59,820
It's all right, Mrs Hughes.

684
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:03,020
I like to keep busy.
Takes your mind off things.

685
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:05,260
What things have you got to take
your mind off?

686
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:10,300
If you're feeling homesick,
there's no shame in it.

687
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:13,380
No.

688
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:16,060
It means you come from a happy home.

689
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:20,140
There's plenty of people here
would envy that.

690
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:23,740
Yes, Mrs Hughes.

691
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:33,380
Will that be all, my Lord?
Yes.

692
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:37,340
That is, not exactly.

693
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:42,660
Have you recovered from your fall
this afternoon?

694
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:44,860
I'm very sorry about that, my Lord.

695
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:46,860
I don't know what happened.

696
00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:50,780
The thing is, Bates.

697
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:53,020
I said I would give you a trial,
and I have.

698
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:55,860
If it were only up to me...

699
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:59,740
It's this question of a valet's
extra duties.

700
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:02,500
Waiting at table
when there's a large party?

701
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:05,740
That, and carrying things, and...

702
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:13,180
You see that Carson can't compromise
the efficiency of his staff?

703
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:15,580
I do, my Lord. Of course I do.

704
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:19,140
Might I make a suggestion?

705
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:21,020
That when an extra footman is
required,

706
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:24,740
the cost could come out of my wages.
Absolutely not. I can't allow that.

707
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:28,380
Because I am very eager to stay,
my Lord. Very eager, indeed.

708
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:33,900
I know you are. And I was eager
that this should work.

709
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:41,580
You see, it is unlikely that I shall
find another position.

710
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:44,340
But in a smaller house,
where less is expected of you...

711
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:48,820
It's not likely. I mean to help
until you find something.

712
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:48,940
It's not likely. I mean to help
until you find something.

713
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:52,820
I couldn't take your money, my Lord.
Just wages for a job done.

714
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:05,060
Very good, my Lord. I'll go at once.
Don't rush out into the night.

715
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:07,740
Take the London train tomorrow.
It leaves at nine.

716
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:10,660
You'll have a month's wages too.
That I insist on.

717
00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:20,500
It's a bloody business, Bates,
but I can't see any way round it.

718
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:23,980
I quite understand, my Lord.

719
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:35,480
I'm afraid we're rather a female
party tonight, Duke.

720
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:39,760
But you know what it's like trying
to balance numbers in the country.

721
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:42,880
A single man outranks
the Holy Grail!

722
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:47,040
No, I'm terribly flattered
to be dining en famille.

723
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:51,680
What were you and Mary doing
in the attics this afternoon?

724
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:55,760
I expect Mary was showing the Duke
the house, weren't you?

725
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:02,360
Are you a student of architecture?
Absolutely.

726
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:05,760
Then I do hope you'll come
and inspect my little cottage.

727
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:09,360
It was designed by Wren
for the first Earl's sister.

728
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:11,600
The attics?
Yes.

729
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:14,440
Mary took the Duke up to the attics.

730
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:16,720
Whatever for?

731
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:19,760
Why was this, dear?
We were just looking around.

732
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:23,400
Looking around? What is there
to look at but servants' rooms?

733
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:29,080
What was the real reason?
Don't be such a chatterbox, Edith!

734
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:29,120
What was the real reason?
Don't be such a chatterbox, Edith!

735
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:33,600
I think we'll go through.
I still don't understand.

736
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:35,760
Will you hold your tongue?

737
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:47,760
How long do you think they'll be?
I'm starving.

738
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:50,200
Have you settled the ladies?
Yes, Mr Carson.

739
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:52,560
Then it won't be long
once they go through.

740
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:54,680
Do you think he'll speak out?

741
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:57,680
Do you think we'll have a duchess
to wait on? Imagine that!

742
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:00,040
You won't be waiting on her!

743
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:03,160
There is no reason why the eldest
daughter and heiress of the Earl

744
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:05,880
should not wear a duchess's coronet
with honour.

745
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:08,840
Heiress, Mr Carson?
Has it been decided?

746
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:11,520
It will be,
if there's any justice in the world.

747
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:15,680
Well, we'll know soon enough.

748
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,200
What are you doing, Anna?

749
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:19,720
I thought I'd take something
up to Mr Bates,

750
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:22,400
him not being well enough
to come down.

751
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:25,440
You don't mind, do you, Mrs Hughes?
I don't mind.

752
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:28,120
Not this once.
No, take him whatever he might need.

753
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:33,960
Mr Bates is leaving without a stain
on his character.

754
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:37,040
I hope you all observe that
in the manner of your parting.

755
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:39,520
I don't see why he has to go.
I don't mind doing extra -

756
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:41,440
It's not up to you.

757
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:44,560
I'll take care of his Lordship,
shall I?

758
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:47,280
Not while you're looking after
the Duke, you won't.

759
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:50,120
I'll see to his Lordship myself.

760
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:58,040
(MUFFLED CRYING AND SNIFFLING)

761
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:21,800
Mr Bates?

762
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:23,440
Are you there?

763
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:42,680
I brought something up,
in case you were hungry.

764
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:45,680
That's very kind.

765
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:59,040
I'm ever so sorry you're going.

766
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:01,400
I'll be all right.

767
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:03,280
Of course you will.

768
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:06,640
There's always a place for a man
like you.

769
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:08,840
Oh, yes...

770
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:10,840
Something'll turn up.

771
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:17,080
Tell us...when you're fixed.

772
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:19,840
Just...drop us a line.

773
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:22,920
Else I'll worry.

774
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:26,480
Well, we can't have that.

775
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,320
(SNIFFS)

776
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:48,240
We must go and let the servants
get in here.

777
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:50,280
I'd be grateful if we can stay
a minute more.

778
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:52,160
I have something to ask you.

779
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:04,440
I was terribly sorry to hear about
your cousins. You said.

780
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:07,760
Did you know them? Not well. I used
to see Patrick at the odd thing.

781
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:13,080
I imagine it will mean
some adjustments for you all.

782
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:20,960
To lose two heirs in one night
is terrible.

783
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:21,200
To lose two heirs in one night
is terrible.

784
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:23,680
Indeed. It was terrible.
Awful.

785
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:30,280
But then again, it's an ill wind...

786
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:36,200
At least Lady Mary's prospects
must have rather improved.

787
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:38,720
Have they?

788
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:42,920
Haven't they?

789
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:47,440
I will not be coy and pretend I do
not understand your meaning,

790
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:50,840
though you seem very informed
on this family's private affairs.

791
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:56,120
But you ought perhaps to know that
I do not intend to fight the entail,

792
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:58,000
not any part of it.

793
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:00,760
You can't be serious.

794
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:04,600
It pains me to say it, but I am.

795
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:12,680
You'll give up your entire estate,

796
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:15,880
your wife's money into the bargain,
to a perfect stranger?

797
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:18,160
You won't even put up a fight?

798
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:21,000
I hope he proves to be perfect,
but I rather doubt it.

799
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,440
Ah...

800
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:25,440
Very odd thing to joke about.

801
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:27,320
No odder than this conversation.

802
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:32,360
So, there you have it.

803
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:34,440
But Mary will still have
her settlement,

804
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:39,000
which you won't find ungenerous.
(COUGHS) I-I'm sorry?

805
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,240
I only meant that her portion,

806
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:45,160
when she marries,
will be more than respectable.

807
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:47,840
You'll be pleased, I promise you.
Oh, heavens.

808
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:49,960
I hope I haven't given the wrong
impression.

809
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:51,600
You know the -
My dear Lord Grantham -

810
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:54,040
Don't 'My dear Lord Grantham' me!

811
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:56,160
You knew what you were doing
when you came here.

812
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:59,800
You encouraged Mary, all of us,
to think -

813
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:03,960
Forgive me, but I came to express
my sympathies and my friendship,

814
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:06,600
nothing more.
(THUNDER RUMBLES)

815
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:08,600
Lady Mary is a charming person.

816
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:12,600
Whoever marries her
will be a lucky man.

817
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:14,800
He will not, however, be me.

818
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:18,280
I see. And what was it that you asked
me to stay behind to hear?

819
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:20,080
(STEADY RAIN AND DISTANT THUNDER)

820
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:23,800
I forget.

821
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:40,880
Aren't you coming into the drawing
room?

822
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:44,480
I-I'm tired.
I think I'll just slip away.

823
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:46,760
Please make my excuses.

824
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:48,920
I'm afraid I've worn you out.

825
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:51,840
Tomorrow, we can just -
I'm leaving in the morning.

826
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:53,760
Good night.

827
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:59,520
Oh, you might tell that footman...
Thomas. Thomas.

828
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:02,200
You might tell him I've gone up.

829
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:21,000
So he slipped the hook.

830
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:25,880
At least I'M not fishing
with no bait!

831
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:36,420
I don't believe that!

832
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:39,740
Well, believe what you like.

833
00:56:39,740 --> 00:56:42,260
He won't break the entail.

834
00:56:42,260 --> 00:56:44,940
The unknown cousin gets everything

835
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:48,500
and Mary's inheritance will be
the same as it always was.

836
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:50,260
How was I to know?
When the lawyer -

837
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:53,740
You weren't to. You did the right
thing to telegraph me.

838
00:56:53,740 --> 00:56:56,660
It's just not going to come off.
So what now?

839
00:56:58,580 --> 00:57:00,500
Well, you, you know how I'm fixed.

840
00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:07,180
I have to have an heiress - if it
means going to New York to find one.

841
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:10,500
What about me?

842
00:57:13,460 --> 00:57:16,300
You...You will wish me well.

843
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:19,660
You said you'd find me a job
if I wanted to leave.

844
00:57:19,660 --> 00:57:21,540
And do you?

845
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:24,940
I want to be a valet.
I'm sick of being a footman.

846
00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:27,340
Thomas, I don't need a valet.

847
00:57:29,340 --> 00:57:32,380
I thought you were getting rid of
the new one here. I've done it,

848
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:35,180
but I'm not sure Carson's going to
let ME take over.

849
00:57:39,180 --> 00:57:41,060
I want to be with you.

850
00:57:54,740 --> 00:57:56,620
I just can't see it working,
can you?

851
00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:02,420
We don't have the basis of a
servant-master relationship, do we?

852
00:58:02,420 --> 00:58:04,900
You came here to be with ME!
Among other reasons.

853
00:58:09,020 --> 00:58:11,700
And...one swallow
doesn't make a summer.

854
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:30,140
Aren't you forgetting something?
What?

855
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:34,180
Are you threatening me?

856
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:39,100
Because of a youthful dalliance?

857
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:42,180
A few weeks of madness
in a London Season?

858
00:58:42,180 --> 00:58:45,140
You wouldn't hold that against me,
surely? I would if I have to.

859
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:53,620
And who'd believe a greedy footman
over the words of a Duke?

860
00:58:54,340 --> 00:58:56,820
If you're not careful,
you'll end up behind bars.

861
00:58:57,980 --> 00:59:00,460
I've got proof.

Hm...

863
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:05,700
Do you mean these?

864
00:59:20,180 --> 00:59:24,100
You know,
my mother's always telling me,
never put anything in writing.

865
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:27,380
And now, thanks to you,
I never will again.

866
00:59:27,380 --> 00:59:30,420
How did you get them, you bastard?

867
00:59:30,420 --> 00:59:32,580
No need to be a bad loser, Thomas.
Go to bed.

871
01:00:08,620 --> 01:00:10,540
I think I'll turn in.

872
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:12,820
No big announcement, then?

873
01:00:12,820 --> 01:00:16,540
No, nor likely to be.

for tomorrow's dinner!

876

I wonder what she did wrong.
She did nothing wrong,

877
01:00:24,220 --> 01:00:27,220
not from the way his Lordship was
talking.

878

So his Grace turned out to be
graceless! Hm!

Good night, Mrs Hughes.
Goodnight, Mr Carson.

(DOOR SHUTS)

881
01:00:39,420 --> 01:00:42,860
If you knew that was your decision,
why put Mary through it?

882
01:00:42,860 --> 01:00:46,780
But I didn't know it was my decision,
my final decision, until tonight.

883
01:00:46,780 --> 01:00:50,180
But I find I cannot ruin the estate
or hollow out the title

884
01:00:50,180 --> 01:00:52,980
for the sake of Mary,
even with a better man than that.

885
01:00:53,620 --> 01:00:56,300
I try to understand. I just can't.

886
01:00:56,300 --> 01:01:00,540
Why should you? Downton is in
my blood and in my bones,
it's not in yours.

887
01:01:00,540 --> 01:01:02,620
And I can no more be the cause of
its destruction

888
01:01:02,620 --> 01:01:04,820
than I could betray my country.

889
01:01:04,820 --> 01:01:07,740
Besides, how was I to know he
wouldn't take her without the money?

890
01:01:07,740 --> 01:01:10,100
Don't pretend to be a child
because it suits you.

891
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:12,780
Do you think she would have been
happy, with a fortune hunter?

892
01:01:12,780 --> 01:01:15,460
She might have been. I was!

893

Have you been happy? Really?

894
01:01:21,860 --> 01:01:24,420
Have I made you happy?
Yes.

895
01:01:28,780 --> 01:01:30,860
That is,
since you fell in love with me,

896
01:01:30,860 --> 01:01:33,860
which if I remember correctly was
about a year after we were married.

Not a year. Not as long as that.

898
01:01:37,980 --> 01:01:40,540
But it wouldn't have happened
for Mary. Why not?

899
01:01:41,820 --> 01:01:44,820
Because I am so much nicer
than the Duke of Crowborough.

900
01:01:46,260 --> 01:01:48,180
I'll be the judge of that.

901

Just don't think I'm going
to let it rest, Robert.

I haven't given up, by any means.

01:02:12,420 --> 01:02:14,380
(BIRDSONG)

906
01:02:19,700 --> 01:02:24,420
my Lord, would it be acceptable for
Bates to ride in front with Taylor?

907
01:02:24,420 --> 01:02:26,540
Otherwise it means getting
the other car out.

908
01:02:26,540 --> 01:02:28,740
He and his Grace are catching
the same train.

909
01:02:28,740 --> 01:02:30,780
Perfectly acceptable.

910
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:33,220
And if his Grace doesn't like it,
he can lump it.

911
01:02:46,660 --> 01:02:49,060
You've been so kind, Lady Grantham.
Thank you.

912
01:02:49,060 --> 01:02:50,940
Goodbye, Duke.

913
01:02:50,940 --> 01:02:53,620
You'll make my farewells
to your delightful daughters?

914
01:02:53,620 --> 01:02:55,900
They'd have been down
if they'd known.

915
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:59,100
Alas, something's come up which has
taken me quite by surprise.

916
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:01,100
Obviously.

917
01:03:01,100 --> 01:03:03,700
Grantham, this has been
a highly enjoyable interlude.

918
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:05,900
Has it? And I feared it had proved
a disappointment.

919
01:03:05,900 --> 01:03:07,580
Not at all, not at all.

920
01:03:07,580 --> 01:03:09,820
My stay in your house
has driven away my cares.

921
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:12,420
We ought to go, my Lord,
if His Grace is to catch the train.

922
01:03:15,780 --> 01:03:17,700
Goodbye, Bates. And good luck.

923
01:03:19,020 --> 01:03:20,940
Good luck to YOU, my Lord.

924
01:03:24,740 --> 01:03:26,660
(ENGINE RUNNING)

925
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:40,180
Wait!

926
01:03:43,060 --> 01:03:45,180
Get out, Bates.

927
01:03:45,180 --> 01:03:47,060
THE DUKE: I really mustn't be late.

928
01:03:48,780 --> 01:03:51,180
Get back inside
and we'll say no more about it.

929
01:04:02,860 --> 01:04:04,780
(MOTOR CAR DRIVES OFF)

930
01:04:06,580 --> 01:04:09,180
It wasn't right, Carson.

931
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:11,060
I just didn't think it was right.

932
01:04:28,300 --> 01:04:30,220
First post, Ma'am.
Thank you, Ellen.

933
01:04:34,300 --> 01:04:36,700
One for you.
Oh. Thank you, Mother.

934
01:04:47,380 --> 01:04:49,540
It's from Lord Grantham.
Really?

935
01:04:49,540 --> 01:04:51,380
What on earth does he want?

936
01:04:54,020 --> 01:04:56,380
He wants to change our lives.

937
01:04:59,580 --> 01:05:01,660
Welcome to Downton.

938
01:05:01,660 --> 01:05:04,060
Why are you so against him?
He isn't one of us.

939
01:05:04,060 --> 01:05:06,420
I stole. I'm a thief.
You have my resignation.

940
01:05:07,420 --> 01:05:10,380
For once in your life,
will you please just listen?

941
01:05:10,380 --> 01:05:12,700
No-one can foresee the future,
Doctor. Not we

942
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:14,900
and certainly not Mrs Crawley.

943
01:05:14,900 --> 01:05:18,460
Oh, no. You're far too busy,
and I wouldn't want to push in.

944
01:05:19,580 --> 01:05:22,180
