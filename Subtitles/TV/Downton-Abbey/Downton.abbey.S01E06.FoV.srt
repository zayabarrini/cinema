00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,005
Last June...

2
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,205
saw Emily Davison...

3
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:37,440
crushed to death beneath the hooves
of the king's horse!

4
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,005
Will the summer of 1914

5
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,720
prove as fatal
for the hopes of women?

6
00:00:43,755 --> 00:00:45,440
It cannot!

7
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,840
This historic by-election...

8
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,540
..has been a first step
on the journey to women's equality.

9
00:00:53,575 --> 00:00:57,005
If you're so keen on women's rights,
let a woman speak!

10
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,880
Why stop there? Let's get the dogs
up and listen to them bark

11
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,120
We are winning! Winning!

12
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,240
You all right, My Lady?

13
00:01:11,275 --> 00:01:13,325
Isn't it exciting?

14
00:01:16,195 --> 00:01:18,365
You're an idiot, man!

15
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,560
I think it's time
for Branson to take you home.

16
00:01:20,595 --> 00:01:22,885
Not yet.
I think so.

17
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,440
I applaud your spirit in coming and I
will applaud your discretion when you go.

18
00:01:26,475 --> 00:01:29,365
But you agree with everything
he says. I do, my dear.

19
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,320
But I also know, if anything happens
to you, Branson will lose his place.

20
00:01:33,355 --> 00:01:36,697
Better safe than sorry, My Lady.

21
00:01:36,732 --> 00:01:40,006
..is an act of mercy. I disagree!

22
00:01:40,041 --> 00:01:43,245
The car is just here.

23
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,860
Women must get the vote,
mustn't they, Branson?

24
00:01:45,895 --> 00:01:48,405
Why does the prime minister
resist the inevitable?

25
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:52,120
Politicians can't often recognise
the changes that are inevitable.

26
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:58,440
I hope you do go into politics.
It's a fine ambition.

27
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,440
Ambition, or dream?

28
00:02:01,475 --> 00:02:03,525
If I do...

29
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:07,480
it's not all about women and the vote,
for me. Nor even freedom for Ireland.

30
00:02:07,515 --> 00:02:10,680
It's the gap between
the aristocracy and the poor and...

31
00:02:10,715 --> 00:02:12,320
And what?

32
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,605
I'm sorry.

33
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,720
I don't mean to speak against
His Lordship.

34
00:02:17,755 --> 00:02:19,997
Why not?
You obviously don't approve of him.

35
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:22,240
Not as a representative
of an oppressive class.

36
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,860
But he's a good man.

37
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:27,885
And a decent employer.

38
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,080
Spoken like a true politician.

39
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,240
What do I look like?

40
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,405
Could you sneak me round the back?

41
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,840
I should hate for Papa
to see me like this.

42
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,560
Where? I'm not a mind reader!

43
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:55,280
Mrs Patmore is very cruel
to that poor girl.

44
00:02:55,315 --> 00:02:58,205
Mrs Patmore is frightened.

45
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:02,560
Is she right to be? Dr Clarkson
has confirmed she has cataracts.

46
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,920
What can be done about it?
There are treatments.

47
00:03:06,955 --> 00:03:09,085
But even the best are uncertain.

48
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,720
She doesn't want to risk
losing what sight she still has.

49
00:03:11,755 --> 00:03:13,685
I don't blame her.

50
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,840
But it can't go on for ever.

51
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,125
No.

52
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,285
Oh, dear.

53
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,525
Have you had bad news?

54
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,720
I shouldn't have bothered you.
No.

55
00:03:25,755 --> 00:03:27,560
You weren't to know.

56
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,965
Oh!
Excuse me, My Lady.

57
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,760
William, will you find Anna
and tell her I've gone upstairs?

58
00:03:40,795 --> 00:03:43,005
Very good, My Lady.

59
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,285
Ooh, sorry.
You clumsy clodhopper!

60
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,365
Sorry.
You will be when I'm done with you.

61
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,360
Leave him alone.
Anna? Lady Sybil's back from Ripon.

62
00:03:51,395 --> 00:03:53,605
She's gone up to her room.
Thank you.

63
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,605
Why does she waste
her precious time on politics?

64
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,085
Hear, hear! Don't you believe in
rights for women, Thomas?

65
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,240
What's it to you? Well, I know you
don't believe in rights of property.

66
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,480
Some people might find that
interesting.

67
00:04:06,515 --> 00:04:08,600
Who's going to tell them? You?

68
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,080
Mr Carson? Are you all right?

69
00:04:19,115 --> 00:04:21,085
Why shouldn't I be?

70
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,560
You never rung the dressing gong.
And Mrs Patmore's

71
00:04:23,595 --> 00:04:25,480
doing a souffle
for the first course.

72
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:27,120
Oh, my God!

73
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,365
Rather unlike Carson.

74
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,460
We'd better go straight into dinner.

75
00:04:32,495 --> 00:04:34,520
I shall tell Miss O'Brien and Anna.

76
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,125
Any more news of the by-election?

77
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,080
Mr Crawley was here. He said his mother
had gone to the Liberal rally in Ripon.

78
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,925
I heard it was...quite lively.

79
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,000
I daresay the townies will make the usual
stink when the Tory candidate's returned.

80
00:04:49,035 --> 00:04:52,297
I'm not sure. I heard the Liberal
was given a hard time today.

81
00:04:52,332 --> 00:04:55,560
Mr Branson said it was
getting out of hand when they left.

82
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:57,685
Typical Branson to be there.

83
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,880
I hope he squared it with Carson.
Who went with him?

84
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,400
Er...

85
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,640
Not sure anyone went with him, sir.
You said 'they.' Who was with him?

86
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,165
I'd rather not say.

87
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,400
Bates? Who was with him?

88
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,245
Lady Sybil.

89
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,525
Lady Sybil?! Why?

90
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,240
I should never have mentioned it,
My Lord. I thought you knew.

91
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,800
No. I did not know.

92
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,100
I gather you went to hear
the Liberal candidate today.

93
00:05:32,135 --> 00:05:34,680
There were several speakers,
actually. He was the last.

94
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,200
Did he speak well?

95
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,240
I thought so.
There was quite a brouhaha.

96
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,565
You know what these things
can be like. I do.

97
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,240
Hence my astonishment you should not feel
it necessary to ask my permission to attend!

98
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,220
I assume this was Branson's scheme.
No. I confess,

99
00:05:54,255 --> 00:05:57,045
I was amused to have an Irish
radical as a chauffeur.

100
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:01,040
But I see now I've been naive!
I told Branson to take Sybil.

101
00:06:01,075 --> 00:06:04,245
What are you saying?!
Sybil needed to go to Ripon.

102
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,480
I asked Branson to drive her.
I thought it would be sensible.

103
00:06:07,515 --> 00:06:10,760
In case there was trouble.
I want to do some canvassing.

104
00:06:10,795 --> 00:06:13,285
The by-election isn't far off.
Canvassing?

105
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,520
Oh, it's quite safe. You're in
a group and you knock on doors.

106
00:06:16,555 --> 00:06:19,280
Yes, I know what canvassing is.
I think that Sybil is -

107
00:06:19,315 --> 00:06:22,205
What? Are you canvassing too?

108
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,885
Or would you rather
take in washing

109
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:28,000
I was only going to say that Sybil
is entitled to her opinions. No.

110
00:06:28,035 --> 00:06:30,325
She isn't until she is married.

111
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,605
Then her husband will tell her
what her opinions are.

112
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:37,040
Oh, Granny! I knew you wouldn't
approve. Which, presumably,

113
00:06:37,075 --> 00:06:38,760
is why you all hid your plans
from me.

114
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:47,000
Her Ladyship'll have a smacked
bottom if she's not careful. Hurry up.

115
00:06:47,035 --> 00:06:48,885
I don't want anything else
to go wrong.

116
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,685
Where's the sauce?
Doesn't this have Hollandaise?

117
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,160
I'll get it. I won't be a jiffy.
Would you do that for me?

118
00:06:54,195 --> 00:06:55,920
I'd do anything for you.

119
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,880
Does this mean you won't be
presented next month?

120
00:07:03,915 --> 00:07:06,205
Certainly not. Why should it?

121
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,720
Well, I doubt I'd expect to
curtsey to their majesties in June

122
00:07:10,755 --> 00:07:13,445
when I'd been arrested
at a riot in May.

123
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,300
But then, I'm old.
Things may be different now.

124
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:19,085
She hasn't been arrested
and it wasn't a riot.

125
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,360
But it might be next time.
There will not be a next time.

126
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,560
Her Ladyship's not best pleased
at being told off in public.

127
00:07:29,595 --> 00:07:31,405
William said
she was looking daggers.

128
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,940
I'm sorry I started all this.
Oh, it's not your fault.

129
00:07:33,975 --> 00:07:36,440
He ought to be glad
he's got a daughter who cares.

130
00:07:36,475 --> 00:07:38,440
Her Ladyship's ready to leave.

131
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,440
I'll bring the car round.

132
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,560
You pleased with yourself

133
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,760
Silly chump.

134
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:57,040
He's nervous. He thinks I'm planning
to tell Mr Carson about the wine.

135
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,520
Well, he shouldn't have stolen it,
then.

136
00:08:00,555 --> 00:08:02,605
No.

137
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,200
But I don't want anyone
to lose their job because of me.

138
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:07,365
Even Thomas?

139
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,280
Even after
what they tried to do to you?

140
00:08:09,315 --> 00:08:11,760
Even then.

141
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,080
Your Ladyship. Do you have a moment?
Of course.

142
00:08:19,115 --> 00:08:21,165
I have received a letter, My Lady.

143
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,565
From a friend of mine. He's valet
to the Marquess of Flintshire.

144
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:28,960
I don't envy him. Lord Flintshire
is a minister at the Foreign Office.

145
00:08:28,995 --> 00:08:31,920
As you know, Lady Flintshire
is His Lordship's cousin.

146
00:08:31,955 --> 00:08:33,925
Oh, of course, of course.
The point is,

147
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,560
he has dealings with
the Turkish Ambassador.

148
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,320
It seems His Excellency has made him
privy to a scurrilous story

149
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:45,240
concerning Lady Mary and the late...

150
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:46,925
Mr Pamuk.

151
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,800
May I read this letter?

152
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,040
Is there anything
you want me to do about it?

153
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,200
No. Thank you.

154
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,560
Sometimes, even to deny these things is
only to throw paraffin onto the flames.

155
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:17,240
I did try to inform His Lordship.
What?

156
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,880
But I...couldn't seem to find
the right moment.

157
00:09:21,915 --> 00:09:23,845
Quite right.

158
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,000
Please leave His Lordship to me.

159
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,920
I'm sorry. The only sure way
to get rid of a servant

160
00:09:30,955 --> 00:09:33,160
is to have him or her
suspected of stealing.

161
00:09:33,195 --> 00:09:35,297
We've tried that,
and it didn't work.

162
00:09:35,332 --> 00:09:37,365
But last time, we invented a theft.

163
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:41,080
We need to make him a suspect when
something's really been stolen.

164
00:09:41,115 --> 00:09:44,240
How do we know anything's been
stolen? Because you stole it.

165
00:09:44,275 --> 00:09:47,445
You noodle!
You mean the wine? Yeah. The wine.

166
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,760
But Bates knows I took it. He was
threatening to tell Mr Carson.

167
00:09:50,795 --> 00:09:53,200
Well, he can't, can he?
Not if we get in first.

168
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,600
Are you telling me
you saw him take the cellar key?

169
00:10:06,635 --> 00:10:08,765
Not exactly. But I saw him in here.

170
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,680
And I thought
the key was swinging on its hook.

171
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,000
I just wondered if
any of the wine was missing.

172
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:25,080
I think I owe you an apology
after the way I spoke at dinner.

173
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,900
Next time you want to treat me
like a naughty schoolgirl,

174
00:10:29,935 --> 00:10:33,005
you might do it in private,
not in front of the servants.

175
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,920
You're right. I'm sorry. Course, it gave
your mother her best evening since Christmas.

176
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,040
Even so, we must try
to keep control of Sybil.

177
00:10:41,075 --> 00:10:42,920
Robert.

178
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,560
Believe me, Sybil...
is not your problem.

179
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,880
We've got to support Mary this year,
when we get to London.

180
00:10:50,915 --> 00:10:53,045
But it's Sybil's first season.

181
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,365
We can't have Mary
stealing her thunder.

182
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,640
Sybil will do well enough.
It's time Mary was settled.

183
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,640
High time.

184
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,000
Poor old Edith.
We never seem to talk about her.

185
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,520
I'm afraid Edith will be the one
to care for us in our old age.

186
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,640
What a ghastly prospect?

187
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,885
Mamma? Anna said you wanted me.

188
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,440
Look who's paid us a visit.
Sir Anthony!

189
00:11:20,475 --> 00:11:22,525
How nice.

190
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,040
We all thought we'd driven you away
with that horrible salty pudding.

191
00:11:26,075 --> 00:11:28,960
No, indeed.
But I have been away.

192
00:11:28,995 --> 00:11:31,920
He's been in Austria and Germany.

193
00:11:31,955 --> 00:11:33,645
How interesting.

194
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,400
Interesting and worrying.

195
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,220
Sir Anthony's here
to show you his new car.

196
00:11:39,255 --> 00:11:41,965
Oh. Yes. I've rather taken to
driving myself.

197
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,160
I have to keep finding destinations
to justify it.

198
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,440
What kind of car is it?
It's an open Rolls Royce.

199
00:11:48,475 --> 00:11:51,000
And I wondered if
you might like a spin in it.

200
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,525
Oh, how kind. But, alas, not today.

201
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,840
I've had Diamond saddled
and he's waiting for me.

202
00:11:57,875 --> 00:12:01,120
You could ride this afternoon.
But it's arranged now.

203
00:12:01,155 --> 00:12:03,320
But thank you, Sir Anthony.

204
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,920
Do ask me again.

205
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,680
I...don't suppose you'd take me.

206
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,560
Of course. I shall be delighted.

207
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,685
What is it that I'm accused of?

208
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,360
Oh...nobody's accusing you
of anything.

209
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,940
But there has been a suggestion
that you were handling

210
00:12:31,975 --> 00:12:35,267
the cellar key.
And, before I take it any further,

211
00:12:35,302 --> 00:12:38,560
I want to find
if there's a simple explanation.

212
00:12:38,595 --> 00:12:40,760
Because some wine is missing.

213
00:12:40,795 --> 00:12:43,200
How do you know that?

214
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,725
Right. Well.

215
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,120
We'll leave it there for now.

216
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,520
The Kaiser
is such a mercurial figure.

217
00:13:03,555 --> 00:13:05,637
One minute the warlord...

218
00:13:05,672 --> 00:13:07,720
the next a lovelorn poet.

219
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,720
But a poet in need of an empire.

220
00:13:11,755 --> 00:13:13,725
That's very good.

221
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,880
Poet in need of an empire. Yes.

222
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,080
My late wife used to say that...

223
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,440
What did Lady Strallan used to say?
Oh, never mind.

224
00:13:24,475 --> 00:13:26,440
But I should like to hear it.
Really?

225
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,085
Would you really?

226
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:34,080
She used to say that Kaiser Bill
loved uniforms and medals...

227
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,600
..but he never really
connected them with fighting.

228
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,320
What was she like?
Maud?

229
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:45,365
Oh, she was awfully funny.

230
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,440
Some people couldn't see it,
but she was.

231
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,600
Is Lynch anywhere about?
I haven't seen him, My Lady.

232
00:14:05,635 --> 00:14:08,400
My horse is lame.
Well, I could have a look at him.

233
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:13,640
Do you know about horses? I looked
after them on my father's farm.

234
00:14:13,675 --> 00:14:16,800
It was the best job in the world.
Then why did you leave it?

235
00:14:16,835 --> 00:14:19,085
My mother wanted me
to better myself.

236
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,600
As a second footman?
It's a good place for me, My Lady.

237
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,680
Of course it is. I'm sorry.

238
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,240
She hopes, one day, that
I might be first footman. Or even

239
00:14:32,275 --> 00:14:34,200
get to be...
Carson had better watch out.

240
00:14:34,235 --> 00:14:36,360
Stranger things happen at sea.

241
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:42,040
I've seen Mr Bates with a bottle
from time to time.

242
00:14:42,075 --> 00:14:44,045
I must've thought
he was helping you.

243
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,420
Why would I order a valet
to help with the wine?

244
00:14:46,455 --> 00:14:48,760
When you put it like that,
of course you wouldn't.

245
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,920
So. Mr Bates is taking wine.

246
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:56,765
And why would this be? To drink it?

247
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,040
It's not to clean his boots
Thank you, Thomas.

248
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,560
Daisy? Thomas says you have
something to add to this. Well...

249
00:15:07,595 --> 00:15:10,280
You're not in any trouble,
or any danger of trouble.

250
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,445
You remember what you saw.

251
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,560
I may have seen him...
coming out of the cellar.

252
00:15:17,595 --> 00:15:19,605
May.

253
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,480
Did you or didn't you?

254
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,360
It's very hard for the girl,
Mr Carson. You're frightening her.

255
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,165
I'm sorry.

256
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,520
Thank you. You may go.

257
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,645
Thank you, O'Brien.

258
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,885
How is everything downstairs?

259
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:54,840
All right, I think, My Lady.
Though Mr Carson's a bit cast down.

260
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:57,077
Oh? Why? What's the matter with him?

261
00:15:57,112 --> 00:15:59,280
He's found out something about...

262
00:15:59,315 --> 00:16:01,677
Well...a person he admires.

263
00:16:01,712 --> 00:16:04,040
And it isn't very nice.

264
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,240
Has he said who this person is...

265
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,620
..who's proved a disappointment?

266
00:16:11,655 --> 00:16:13,920
I don't like to say, My Lady.

267
00:16:13,955 --> 00:16:15,920
Please do, if you know.

268
00:16:15,955 --> 00:16:17,520
Oh, I know.

269
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,725
It's Mr Bates.

270
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,565
Oh, Bates? Why? What's he done?

271
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,000
You should ask Mr Carson, My Lady.
It's not my place to tell.

272
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,320
Papa.

273
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:39,520
Can...Branson drive me into Ripon...
on Friday evening?

274
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:43,560
I don't think so, no.
Not after the last time.

275
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,560
Oh, please. There's a meeting
of my borstal charity.

276
00:16:48,595 --> 00:16:50,640
I've missed two,
and I simply must be there.

277
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,200
You'd have to take
Mary or Edith with you.

278
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:59,240
Don't make me. Those meetings
are deadly at the best of times.

279
00:16:59,275 --> 00:17:02,280
And you know what they're like
when they're bored.

280
00:17:02,315 --> 00:17:05,445
Why are all your causes
so steeped in gloom?

281
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,600
Because it's the gloomy things
that need our help.

282
00:17:08,635 --> 00:17:11,720
If everything in the garden's
sunny...why meddle?

283
00:17:11,755 --> 00:17:14,045
Well, I agree with that.

284
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:17,200
Talking of sunny, are you looking
forward to your coming season?

285
00:17:17,235 --> 00:17:19,080
I am rather.

286
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:25,365
Hello. What are you doing here?

287
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,480
I'm in search of your father.
Carson thought he was outside.

288
00:17:28,515 --> 00:17:30,360
He's in the library.

289
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:38,960
What is it? Nothing much. I've had
an enquiry about one of the farms.

290
00:17:38,995 --> 00:17:40,600
Ah.

291
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,445
So.

292
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,560
What's new at the big house?

293
00:17:51,595 --> 00:17:53,725
Oh. Sybil, mainly.

294
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,080
She's discovered politics, which,
of course, makes Papa see red.

295
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,640
I admire Sybil's passion, though.

296
00:18:00,675 --> 00:18:02,520
Of course.

297
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,920
But then, I like a good argument.
Papa does not.

298
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,600
If you really like an argument...

299
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,240
Yes?
We should see more of each other.

300
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,280
So, it's all right? I can go?

301
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,205
Will you be late?

302
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,325
I think I'll miss dinner.
Well, remember

303
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,960
to tell Branson to take a sandwich
for himself.

304
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,000
But who's it from?
Susan Flintshire.

305
00:18:44,035 --> 00:18:46,045
What does she say?

306
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,480
Well, prepare yourself for the worst.

307
00:18:48,515 --> 00:18:50,605
Not the first page.

308
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,480
My poor niece never uses one word
when twenty will do.

309
00:18:53,515 --> 00:18:56,097
Start there. 'I am sorry...'

310
00:18:56,132 --> 00:18:58,645
'I am sorry to have to tell you

311
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:02,400
that Hugh has heard a vile story
about your granddaughter Mary.'

312
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,840
Sorry? She's thrilled

313
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,045
Now. First I must ask...

314
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,800
And I want you to think carefully
before you answer.

315
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,080
Is any of this true?

316
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,325
I see.

317
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,280
Some of it IS true.

318
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,400
How much?

319
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:33,045
Oh, dear.

320
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,325
She didn't drag him.

321
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:39,560
I wondered about that. Obviously,
Susan's forgotten...the distance

322
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:43,097
between the girls' rooms
and the bachelor's corridor.

323
00:19:43,132 --> 00:19:46,600
She couldn't manage it alone.
So, how did she do it?

324
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,720
I helped her. She woke me up.
And I helped her.

325
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,760
Well...

326
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:01,960
I always thought...this family
might be approaching dissolution...

327
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,240
I didn't know dissolution
was already upon us.

328
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,885
Does Robert know?

329
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,960
No. And he isn't going to.

330
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,645
Oh.

331
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:19,200
Of course, it was terribly wrong. It was
all terribly wrong. But I didn't see wha-

332
00:20:19,235 --> 00:20:21,365
Please.

333
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,760
I can't listen to your attempts
to try and justify yourself.

334
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,040
I know this is hard for you to hear.

335
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,280
God knows, it was
hard for me to live through.

336
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,160
But if you expect me
to disown my daughter...

337
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,160
..I'm afraid you will be
disappointed.

338
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,080
Good day.

339
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,720
I thought you must be out here.

340
00:20:59,755 --> 00:21:01,600
And you'd be right.

341
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,080
I know you're upset.
Yes, I'm upset.

342
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,685
I've been working here two years.

343
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,240
And yet, Mr Carson has no difficulty
believing the worst of me.

344
00:21:14,275 --> 00:21:16,617
I think he has
a great deal of difficulty.

345
00:21:16,652 --> 00:21:18,960
Which is why he hasn't
told His Lordship yet.

346
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,960
Can't you just explain about Thomas?
No, no.

347
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,000
It would sound like
a false accusation.

348
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,565
You can't take it lying down.

349
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,645
Because you're not guilty
of any wrong.

350
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,200
And, before it's over,
I'm gonna tell the world.

351
00:21:34,235 --> 00:21:36,245
Are you?

352
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,520
I'm not sure the world is listening.

353
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,020
Sorry. I'm a bit late tonight.

354
00:21:45,055 --> 00:21:47,160
Not to worry. How are you?

355
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,405
Bearing up.

356
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,840
This isn't the end.
You mustn't give up.

357
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:55,925
We'll get there.

358
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,280
Forgive me, My Lady, but...

359
00:21:58,315 --> 00:22:00,445
You don't get it.

360
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,300
You're brought up to think
it's all within your grasp.

361
00:22:03,335 --> 00:22:06,120
That if you want something enough,
it will come to you.

362
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,405
Well, we're not like that.

363
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,040
We don't think our dreams
are bound to come true, because...

364
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,245
Because they almost never do.

365
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,320
Then, that's why we must
stick together.

366
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,240
Your dream is my dream now.

367
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,320
I'll make it come true.

368
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:33,240
Why hasn't he done anything?
He's had the story and the witnesses.

369
00:22:33,275 --> 00:22:35,365
The witnesses?

370
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,560
What do you think this is?
A murder mystery?

371
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,880
Mr Bates can't accuse me now. It'll sound
as if he's trying to get his own back.

372
00:22:42,915 --> 00:22:46,120
If I lose my job over this,
I swear to God, I'll swing for you.

373
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:56,800
Is there any stale bread
you're throwing out?

374
00:22:56,835 --> 00:22:58,765
And some salt.
Why?

375
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,640
Well, I thought I'd make
a last hot poultice for Diamond.

376
00:23:01,675 --> 00:23:04,777
It'll give him a better night.
You big softy.

377
00:23:04,812 --> 00:23:07,880
What'll Mr Lynch say?
Oh, he doesn't mind.

378
00:23:07,915 --> 00:23:09,560
He says I've got the touch.

379
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,280
He thinks I should pack this in
and be a groom. Why don't you?

380
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,285
My mum...

381
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,080
She was so excited when I came here.

382
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,160
They're proud of me,
and I'd hate to spoil that.

383
00:23:23,195 --> 00:23:24,760
Do you miss 'em?

384
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,360
I never had that in my childhood.

385
00:23:30,395 --> 00:23:32,600
Someone you could always trust.

386
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,680
Well, I trust them, they trust me.

387
00:23:35,715 --> 00:23:37,640
There are no lies in our house.

388
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,640
Thanks. That's enough.

389
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,645
I'm glad to catch you.

390
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:54,640
We have a conundrum at the hospital,
and I would value your opinion.

391
00:23:54,675 --> 00:23:57,005
Of course.
We've been treating...

392
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,045
the mother of your footman
William Mason.

393
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:02,245
What's the matter with her?
Heart, I'm afraid.

394
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:06,160
She's forbidden us to say anything
to her son. That's ridiculous.

395
00:24:06,195 --> 00:24:09,080
She's gone home now,
but she's still very ill.

396
00:24:09,115 --> 00:24:11,085
Clearly, the boy should
go and see her.

397
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,760
And I assume you would
have no objections? Course not.

398
00:24:13,795 --> 00:24:15,680
So.

399
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:20,720
Do we break a patient's confidence
and disobey her orders...or not?

400
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,420
We can't...if she's forbidden it.

401
00:24:24,455 --> 00:24:26,565
I must say, I agree with you.

402
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:29,280
Well, I'll tell him.
No. You will not.

403
00:24:29,315 --> 00:24:31,960
She has rights, too.
And there are rules.

404
00:24:31,995 --> 00:24:33,800
I don't care a fig about rules.

405
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,845
Where to from here, My Lady?

406
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,840
What do you mean? We've arrived?
The meeting's in this place?

407
00:24:42,875 --> 00:24:45,800
This IS the meeting. We're here
for the counting of the votes.

408
00:24:45,835 --> 00:24:48,285
I don't understand. I thought that -

409
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,960
Don't be silly, Branson. You didn't
think I'd miss my very first by-election.

410
00:24:51,995 --> 00:24:54,565
His Lordship won't approve.
Let me worry about him.

411
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,440
I have to park the car. Don't move!
Stay where you are! Really!

412
00:24:57,475 --> 00:24:59,600
I thought I gave the orders.

413
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,085
Sir Anthony Strallan.
Sir Anthony.

414
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,125
Don't worry.
I haven't got the date wrong.

415
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:11,280
What a relief. I could hear Cora
wondering if dinner would stretch

416
00:25:11,315 --> 00:25:13,445
No, I'm not really here at all.

417
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:17,325
But I was driving past your gates
and I thought I'd take a chance.

418
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:21,640
See, the thing is, I've got two tickets
for a concert in York next Friday.

419
00:25:21,675 --> 00:25:23,640
How nice. Although, I can't -

420
00:25:23,675 --> 00:25:25,405
No.

421
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,525
I was hoping that Lady Edith
might like to accompany me.

422
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:32,560
But I'd love to. Shouldn't you
ask what sort of concert it is?

423
00:25:32,595 --> 00:25:35,205
Oh, just Hungry Hundreds stuff,
mostly. You know.

424
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:38,360
Bellini, Puccini, Rossini.
I'm not up to anything complicated.

425
00:25:38,395 --> 00:25:40,685
I...I'd like that very much.

426
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,285
Excellent. Well, it's quite a hike,
so I'll pick you up around six?

427
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:48,320
Lady Jervas has asked us for a bite to eat
after, if that's all right with your mother.

428
00:25:48,355 --> 00:25:50,357
By all means.
Well, I must run.

429
00:25:50,392 --> 00:25:52,325
I hope I haven't spoilt your dinner.

430
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,520
We may have to
hire a nurse after all

431
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,160
Oh, for heaven's sake hold it steady, if you
don't want to start again from the beginning.

432
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:10,400
Do these biscuits go up? No. I put
them out for the fairies Oh.

433
00:26:10,435 --> 00:26:12,520
Of course they're going up!

434
00:26:12,555 --> 00:26:14,765
What's wrong with you?

435
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:18,640
You're always dozy, but tonight
you make Sleeping Beauty look alert.

436
00:26:18,675 --> 00:26:21,920
I was just thinking... Ooh, Blimey!
Batten down the hatches

437
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:24,177
I think I've let myself down.

438
00:26:24,212 --> 00:26:26,400
It can't be a new sensation.

439
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,920
The Honourable Joseph Gerald Ansty...

440
00:26:41,955 --> 00:26:44,760
..for the Conservative
and Unionist Party...

441
00:26:44,795 --> 00:26:47,045
6,363 votes.

442
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,165
Votes for women! Votes for women!

443
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,880
Martin James Dillon,
the Socialist Party...

444
00:26:52,915 --> 00:26:56,165
2,741 votes.

445
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:59,000
Call it a day, My Lady!
Don't be silly. This is the moment

446
00:26:59,035 --> 00:27:01,125
we've come for.

447
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:04,085
Trevor Andrew Morgan,
the Liberal Party...

448
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:07,120
This lot aren't interested in votes.
They're spoiling for a fight!

449
00:27:07,155 --> 00:27:10,845
..5,894 votes.

450
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,040
I hereby declare...

451
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,360
Come on.
Out you get, lads.

452
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,760
We'll soon wipe the smile off
their Tory bloody faces!

453
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:33,685
..is duly elected...to serve
as member of parliament...

454
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:38,040
..member of parliament... Sybil!
..for the Ripon constituency.

455
00:27:38,075 --> 00:27:40,160
What are you doing here?
I couldn't miss this.

456
00:27:40,195 --> 00:27:42,365
Couldn't you? I could!

457
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,240
I don't like the look of this,
My Lady!

458
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,605
Look. Look!

459
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,880
I'm on your side. Don't cause any
trouble. Believe me!

460
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,280
What's your problem, Mr Lah-di-dah?
My problem is you.

461
00:27:54,315 --> 00:27:55,760
Oh, aye?

462
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,360
Oh, no. Oh, please, God, no!

463
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,120
This way!

464
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,680
I fetched a coat.
Why? What do I need a coat for?

465
00:28:23,715 --> 00:28:25,765
I've come to fetch you, My Lady.

466
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,720
We've taken Lady Sybil
to Crawley House.

467
00:28:27,755 --> 00:28:29,765
What's happened?

468
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,800
I took her to Ripon for the count.

469
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:33,880
She got injured in a fight.

470
00:28:33,915 --> 00:28:36,280
Take me there at once.

471
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,405
My God!

472
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:49,125
Oh, my darling!

473
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,565
I didn't know what to do.
I had Branson bring her here.

474
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,720
Quite right. Mamma would have
fainted if she'd seen her like this.

475
00:28:54,755 --> 00:28:57,240
As for Papa...
This will sting a bit.

476
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,320
But it's stopped bleeding.

477
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:04,125
Did you know she was planning this?

478
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:07,445
Of course not.
Well, what were you doing there?

479
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:11,240
Working late. I'd forgotten it was
election night, or I wouldn't have stayed.

480
00:29:11,275 --> 00:29:14,977
I'm so grateful you did.
Oh, I could wring Branson's neck!

481
00:29:15,012 --> 00:29:18,680
What was he thinking? I'm afraid
it'll cost him his job. No!

482
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:21,805
I told him he was taking me
to a committee meeting.

483
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,280
When he saw what it was,
he wanted to come straight back.

484
00:29:24,315 --> 00:29:26,397
You'll have to stick up for him.

485
00:29:26,432 --> 00:29:28,445
Because Papa will skin him alive.

486
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,600
Are you feeling strong enough
to go home?

487
00:29:30,635 --> 00:29:32,645
I think so.

488
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,160
If you'll take me.

489
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:45,440
Here. Wear my coat
to cover the blood.

490
00:29:45,475 --> 00:29:47,360
You'll look more normal.

491
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,560
Lean on me.

492
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:59,240
Thank you so much for this.

493
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,245
By the way.
How is William's mother?

494
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:08,200
Not good, I'm afraid. She's home,
but she's still very weak.

495
00:30:08,235 --> 00:30:12,177
Another attack should finish her.
And he still doesn't know?

496
00:30:12,212 --> 00:30:16,120
She's adamant. I've tried to explain
how hard it'll be on him.

497
00:30:16,155 --> 00:30:18,245
But she won't have him disturbed.

498
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,560
To hear her talk, you'd think
he was a cabinet minister.

499
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,125
He's made her proud.

500
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:27,800
There are plenty of children in grander
circumstances who'd love to say the same.

501
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:38,580
I wish you'd tell me
what's troubling you.

502
00:30:38,615 --> 00:30:41,565
If it's this business
with Mr Bates...

503
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,000
It's not that.
I'll get to the bottom of that.

504
00:30:44,035 --> 00:30:46,165
Well, I hope you'll do it soon.

505
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,400
If there's one thing I hate,
it's an atmosphere.

506
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:52,605
And we've got a real atmosphere
going now.

507
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,920
It's an unfair rumour
which needs to be scotched.

508
00:30:55,955 --> 00:30:59,200
It's very hard to hear
the names of people you love

509
00:30:59,235 --> 00:31:01,257
dragged in the mud.

510
00:31:01,292 --> 00:31:03,280
You feel so powerless.

511
00:31:03,315 --> 00:31:05,405
Well. I...

512
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,520
respect Mr Bates, but...
I'm not sure that I love him.

513
00:31:08,555 --> 00:31:10,640
I wasn't thinking of Mr Bates.

514
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,880
Mr Carson, have you got a minute?
What is it, Daisy?

515
00:31:14,915 --> 00:31:16,925
Mr Carson's a very busy man.

516
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,120
I know he is.
But I think he'll want to hear this.

517
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,605
I told you something
that wasn't true.

518
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:27,245
Why would you do that?
I did it as a favour...

519
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:30,760
for a friend. But I know
now it was wrong to ask it of me.

520
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:47,160
She's not badly hurt, is she?
I don't think so, no.

521
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,680
Thank God.

522
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:55,600
Better be prepared. I'm afraid
Lord Grantham will hit the roof.

523
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,285
I never would've taken her there.

524
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:01,560
I may be a socialist,
but I'm not a lunatic.

525
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,600
I'm not sure Papa
knows the difference.

526
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,680
You'll let me know how she gets on?

527
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,320
Please.

528
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,080
If you wish.

529
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,125
How dare you? How DARE you

530
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:38,080
disobey me in this way?!
Robert. I'm sure -

531
00:32:38,115 --> 00:32:39,680
Are you so knowledgeable...

532
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,085
Papa, I'm sorry I disobeyed you.

533
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,685
But I'm interested, I'm political,
I have opinions!

534
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:51,480
Of course, I blame Branson. I don't
think that's fair. We had none of this.

535
00:32:51,515 --> 00:32:53,605
None of it!
Until he set foot in our house.

536
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:57,120
I suppose I should give thanks he hasn't
burnt the place down over our heads!

537
00:32:57,155 --> 00:32:59,200
Branson knew nothing
until we arrived there.

538
00:32:59,235 --> 00:33:01,365
He leaves tonight.

539
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:04,860
If you punish Branson, I'll never
speak to you again. Never!

540
00:33:04,895 --> 00:33:08,320
I don't believe this is Branson's
fault. Truly, Papa. Blame me.

541
00:33:08,355 --> 00:33:10,520
I do blame you!
Robert, can we do this

542
00:33:10,555 --> 00:33:13,125
in the morning? Sybil needs rest.

543
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,560
But if I find tomorrow
that Branson is missing...

544
00:33:15,595 --> 00:33:17,797
I'll run away, I warn you.

545
00:33:17,832 --> 00:33:20,000
Oh! And where would you go?

546
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:25,280
Well, I can't think now.
But I will go. And you'll be sorry.

547
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:32,040
I should be sorry. Very sorry indeed.

548
00:33:34,075 --> 00:33:36,325
How is she?

549
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:39,720
She'll be perfectly fine. I gather
you're the shining knight in all this.

550
00:33:39,755 --> 00:33:43,080
Not really. But I'm glad
I was there. So am I, by heaven.

551
00:33:43,115 --> 00:33:45,837
If it had been left to
that bloody fool Branson...

552
00:33:45,872 --> 00:33:48,560
You should see what he reads.
It's all Marx and Ruskin

553
00:33:48,595 --> 00:33:51,205
and John Stuart Mill. I ask you.
Papa prefers

554
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,965
the servants to read the Bible
and letters from home

555
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,280
There are sandwiches for Mr Crawley
in the dining room, Lady Mary.

556
00:33:57,315 --> 00:33:59,645
Thank you, Mrs Hughes.

557
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:02,885
We couldn't let you starve.
You really didn't have to.

558
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:05,880
Mary, you look after Matthew.
I'll go up and revive your mother.

559
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,725
Do you stand by your story?

560
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:16,100
I don't have a story. You saw Mr Bates
in here alone, hanging up the cellar key.

561
00:34:16,135 --> 00:34:20,405
To me, that is a story. I only said I
might have seen him. I suppose I was wrong.

562
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:25,400
And Miss O'Brien. Were you then wrong when
you thought you saw Mr Bates carrying a bottle?

563
00:34:25,435 --> 00:34:27,525
You wicked creature!
Anna.

564
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:30,280
You are here to watch,
not to participate.

565
00:34:30,315 --> 00:34:32,657
I don't think I was wrong, no.

566
00:34:32,692 --> 00:34:35,000
What do you say to that, Mr Bates?

567
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,760
I know this to be untrue
because I have no need of it.

568
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,965
Since I arrived at Downton...

569
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,340
you have never seen me...
drink one drop of alcohol.

570
00:34:45,375 --> 00:34:48,680
Let us say, then,
that Miss O'Brien was...mistaken.

571
00:34:48,715 --> 00:34:50,085
Mistaken, my eye!

572
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:54,680
And Daisy, we all know the value
of your contribution. Yes, Mr Carson.

573
00:34:54,715 --> 00:34:57,685
But I must ask one thing, Mr Bates.

574
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,600
How did you know
the wine had been taken?

575
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:04,240
I'm afraid I cannot answer that.

576
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,320
We can drink to Sybil's safe return.

577
00:35:08,355 --> 00:35:10,445
Why not?

578
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,400
I'll ring for a glass.
No, never mind that.

579
00:35:12,435 --> 00:35:14,600
Here.

580
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,760
You're not very fastidious about
doing things properly, are you?

581
00:35:19,795 --> 00:35:21,725
Are you?

582
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,640
Less than you might think.

583
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,200
Are you at all political?

584
00:35:33,235 --> 00:35:35,445
Yes.

585
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:39,200
But with a hung parliament, it's hard
to get excited about a by-election.

586
00:35:39,235 --> 00:35:41,200
You know, nothing will change...

587
00:35:41,235 --> 00:35:43,200
whoever gets in.

588
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:51,005
If I might keep you for a minute
more, Mr Carson...

589
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:54,280
If you'd like me to leave... No. I
would like you to stay, Mrs Hughes.

590
00:35:54,315 --> 00:35:56,605
And you, Anna.

591
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,925
You have decided...

592
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:02,680
not to take action over the
allegations Thomas has made against me

593
00:36:02,715 --> 00:36:05,005
because you believe them
to be untrue.

594
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,280
That is correct. And you are right.
There is no truth in them.

595
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:13,600
But, if you were to proceed with the
matter, you would find them to be proven.

596
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:19,080
Thomas has tried to convince you
that I am a drunkard and a thief.

597
00:36:19,115 --> 00:36:22,600
Which we never believed.
Because you know no different.

598
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,280
Until a couple of years ago,
I was a drunkard.

599
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:31,880
And I was imprisoned...as a thief.

600
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,805
I have...

601
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:40,560
repaid your kindness...very poorly.

602
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,200
I masqueraded as a man of...honour.

603
00:36:45,235 --> 00:36:47,165
And integrity.

604
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,280
But, by any moral code...

605
00:36:49,315 --> 00:36:51,520
I am disgraced.

606
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:56,205
That can't be the whole story.

607
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:59,600
Perhaps not.
But it's enough of it to demand...

608
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:02,280
..my resignation.

609
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:06,720
Do you want to leave, Mr Bates?

610
00:37:06,755 --> 00:37:09,445
No. But I feel I have no choice.

611
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,720
You owe me a say in the matter,
surely?

612
00:37:11,755 --> 00:37:13,885
If you wish.

613
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,085
Then I will consider the case

614
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:19,040
and give you my decision when I have
discussed it with His Lordship.

615
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:23,040
Until then, I hope
you will remain in your post.

616
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,240
Thank you for
coming to Sybil's rescue.

617
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,405
You were very brave.

618
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,400
She told me you knocked a man down.

619
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,125
I hope I did my duty.

620
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,040
Are you a creature of duty?

621
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:47,325
Not entirely.

622
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,640
When you laugh with me or...
flirt with me...

623
00:37:49,675 --> 00:37:51,600
is that a duty?

624
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:56,360
Are you conforming
to the fitness of things?

625
00:37:56,395 --> 00:37:58,240
Doing what's expected?

626
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,360
Don't play with me.

627
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,840
I don't deserve it. Not from you.

628
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:10,280
You must be careful
not to break Sybil's heart.

629
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,525
I think she has a crush on you.

630
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:16,000
Well, that's something
no-one could accuse you of.

631
00:38:16,035 --> 00:38:17,880
Oh, I don't know.

632
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:23,040
I assume you speak
in a spirit of mockery.

633
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,080
You should have more faith.

634
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:31,280
Shall I remind you
of some of the choicest remarks

635
00:38:31,315 --> 00:38:33,040
you made about me
when I arrived here?

636
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:37,565
Because they live in my memory.

637
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,600
As fresh as the day
they were spoken.

638
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:43,040
Oh, Matthew.
What am I always telling you?

639
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,680
You must pay no attention
to the things I say.

640
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,360
Mr Bates.
Anna.

641
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:14,325
Will you really leave?

642
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,720
I doubt His Lordship
wants a thief in the house.

643
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:23,360
Now, go to sleep...
and dream of a better man.

644
00:39:23,395 --> 00:39:25,240
I can't.

645
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,240
Because there isn't one.

646
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,605
Has Matthew gone?
Yes.

647
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,800
Thank the Lord he was there.

648
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:04,160
I hope you thanked Matthew properly.

649
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,040
I got them to make him
some sandwiches.

650
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,840
That's not quite what I meant.

651
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,565
And he asked me to marry him.

652
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:18,240
Heavens! What did they
put in them I'm serious.

653
00:40:18,275 --> 00:40:20,320
He proposed to me.

654
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,200
Oh, my dear!

655
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,940
Have you given him an answer?

656
00:40:27,975 --> 00:40:30,000
Only that I'd think about it.

657
00:40:30,035 --> 00:40:31,885
Well...

658
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,720
That's an advance on what
it would've been a year ago.

659
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,080
Do you want to marry him?
I know you want me to marry him.

660
00:40:40,115 --> 00:40:42,080
What we want doesn't matter.

661
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,880
At least, it's not all that matters.

662
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,440
Do you love Matthew?

663
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,200
Yes.

664
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,080
I think perhaps I do.

665
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,800
I think I may have loved him
for much longer than I knew.

666
00:41:03,835 --> 00:41:06,360
Oh, my darling!

667
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:11,480
Let's not pretend this isn't the
answer to every one of our prayers.

668
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:16,240
I'd have to tell him.

669
00:41:16,275 --> 00:41:18,080
Oh.

670
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,725
Is it absolutely necessary?

671
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:24,160
If I didn't, I'd feel as if
I'd caught him with a lie.

672
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:31,520
I hope you know that really smart
people sleep in separate rooms.

673
00:41:31,555 --> 00:41:33,965
I always keep the bed made up
in the dressing room.

674
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,520
So at least I pretend
we sleep apart. Isn't that enough?

675
00:41:36,555 --> 00:41:38,600
No. Never mind.

676
00:41:38,635 --> 00:41:40,520
Goodnight.

677
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:46,560
Oh. Haven't you gone up yet?

678
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:50,080
Blow this out. You're the last.

679
00:41:50,115 --> 00:41:51,960
Goodnight.
Goodnight.

680
00:41:51,995 --> 00:41:53,840
Goodnight.

681
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,420
I'm gonna bloody get him.
I don't care what you say.

682
00:41:59,455 --> 00:42:02,360
What would I say?
Everything comes to him who waits.

683
00:42:02,395 --> 00:42:04,240
And I've waited long enough.

684
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,485
Does Carson know you're here?
I heard you were going out.

685
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:15,965
I wanted to see how he was walking.
Lynch is happy for me to ride him.

686
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Oh, yes. He's better. But I'll wait
and see what he's like when you're up.

687
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,240
William, are you planning
to go home soon?

688
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,725
Well, it's a bit far
for my half day.

689
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:30,160
But I can maybe get the time in
July, when the family's in London.

690
00:42:30,195 --> 00:42:31,920
That's if I don't go with you,
of course.

691
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:37,600
I think you should take a few
days off and go now. I'll fix it.

692
00:42:37,635 --> 00:42:39,960
I'll speak to Father and to Carson.
No-one will mind.

693
00:42:39,995 --> 00:42:41,840
But why, My Lady?

694
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,560
Your mother's not been well.

695
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:50,960
How do you know? I heard someone
mention it in the village. I forget who.

696
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:53,840
I had a letter, and she never said.

697
00:42:53,875 --> 00:42:55,845
Oh, I'm sure it's nothing.

698
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:57,880
I know it will cheer her to see you.

699
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,485
Well...if it wouldn't be a bother.

700
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:04,520
It won't. I'll arrange it
as soon as I get back.

701
00:43:04,555 --> 00:43:06,920
Thank you very much, My Lady.

702
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:12,120
She ought to spend some time
with the people she loves.

703
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:19,280
The Dowager Countess, My Lady.

704
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,920
Good afternoon, my dear.

705
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:26,325
Good afternoon.

706
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:29,000
There's no need to be so prim.
I come in peace.

707
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,960
Shall I sit here?

708
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:39,620
Now, I've been thinking.

709
00:43:39,655 --> 00:43:41,725
I confess I do not know

710
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:44,840
if I would have had the strength,
mentally or physically...

711
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,240
..to carry a corpse...

712
00:43:48,275 --> 00:43:50,240
the length of this house.

713
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:53,880
But I hope I would've done.

714
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:57,485
You were quite right.

715
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,925
When something bad happens...

716
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:02,520
there's no point
in wishing it had not happened.

717
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:07,320
The only option
is to minimise the damage.

718
00:44:07,355 --> 00:44:09,160
Or try to.

719
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:12,360
But if the Flintshires
have got hold of it -

720
00:44:12,395 --> 00:44:14,417
I've written to Susan.

721
00:44:14,452 --> 00:44:16,405
I said it was a story

722
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:19,160
made up by Mr Pamuk's enemies

723
00:44:19,195 --> 00:44:21,245
to discredit him.

724
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:23,960
Even if she doesn't believe me,
she won't tell,

725
00:44:23,995 --> 00:44:27,197
in case it reflects badly on her.

726
00:44:27,232 --> 00:44:29,956
The ambassador...is dangerous.

727
00:44:29,991 --> 00:44:32,645
But then...how many people

728
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:34,760
really go to the Turkish Embassy?

729
00:44:34,795 --> 00:44:36,800
It only takes one.

730
00:44:36,835 --> 00:44:38,525
Well...

731
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:40,485
That just can't be helped.

732
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:42,600
We can't have him assassinated...

733
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:45,645
I suppose.

734
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:48,165
Robert still doesn't suspect.

735
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:51,360
Oh, I should hope not.
No. Our only way forward...

736
00:44:51,395 --> 00:44:54,520
is to get Mary settled
as soon as possible.

737
00:44:54,555 --> 00:44:56,845
I have news on that score.

738
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:00,005
Matthew has proposed.
My, my!

739
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:02,605
Has she said yes?
She hasn't said anything yet,

740
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:05,680
except that she's going to have to
tell him about Pamuk.

741
00:45:05,715 --> 00:45:08,445
For heaven's sake! Why?

742
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:11,120
She thinks to keep it secret
would be dishonourable.

743
00:45:11,155 --> 00:45:13,200
She reads too many novels.

744
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:17,520
I mean, one way or another,
everyone goes down the aisle

745
00:45:17,555 --> 00:45:19,520
with half the story hidden.

746
00:45:19,555 --> 00:45:21,485
The question is...

747
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,960
will she accept Matthew?

748
00:45:23,995 --> 00:45:25,640
I'm not sure.

749
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:30,120
Well, if she doesn't,
we'll just have to take her abroad.

750
00:45:30,155 --> 00:45:32,325
In these moments...

751
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:35,680
you can normally find an Italian
who isn't too picky.

752
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:41,125
We'll give her till the start
of the grouse. Very well.

753
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:44,800
If she turns Matthew down, we'll
take her to Rome in the autumn.

754
00:45:44,835 --> 00:45:46,720
It's official.

755
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:51,365
Thank you for
not turning against her.

756
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:55,000
I know that you have rules and, when people
break them, you find it hard to forgive.

757
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:58,080
I understand that...

758
00:45:58,115 --> 00:46:00,080
and I respect it.

759
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:03,960
In this case,
Mary has the trump card.

760
00:46:03,995 --> 00:46:05,285
What?

761
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:07,200
Mary is family.

762
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:15,380
Unusual, obviously.

763
00:46:15,415 --> 00:46:17,280
Unusual? It's biblical.

764
00:46:17,315 --> 00:46:18,605
Not quite.

765
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:21,420
If she won't say yes
when he might be poor,

766
00:46:21,455 --> 00:46:24,165
he won't want her
when he will be rich.

767
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:26,520
Do you love me enough
to spend your life with me?

768
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,480
There's a war coming.
And war means change.
