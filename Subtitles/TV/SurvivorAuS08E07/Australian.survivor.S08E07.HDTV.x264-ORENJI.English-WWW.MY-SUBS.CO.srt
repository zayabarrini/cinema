00:00:00,438 --> 00:00:03,517
Previously on Australian Survivor...

2
00:00:03,558 --> 00:00:06,637
- Keep going, keep going, keep going.
- ..Brawn was on a challenge roll...

3
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:08,672
Go, team!

4
00:00:08,672 --> 00:00:15,391
..firing on all cylinders to bring
home reward and immunity.

5
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:17,831
Let's go! Let's go!

6
00:00:17,872 --> 00:00:21,191
Sending brains to
their third tribal council.

7
00:00:21,232 --> 00:00:23,311
King George's head has got to go.

8
00:00:23,352 --> 00:00:28,071
With a 6-4 majority, Joey was
hell bent on getting George.

9
00:00:28,112 --> 00:00:31,471
Tonight's the night we can
finally chop King George's head off.

10
00:00:31,512 --> 00:00:35,751
Then Cara found an idol.

11
00:00:35,792 --> 00:00:38,351
- This idol. It's a golden ticket.
- Sit down.

12
00:00:38,392 --> 00:00:40,631
The plan was to play it for George,

13
00:00:40,672 --> 00:00:43,671
but it relied on Baden
and Wai voting with them.

14
00:00:43,712 --> 00:00:46,871
If we stick together,
they have no option.

15
00:00:46,912 --> 00:00:48,671
- But...
- I'm sorry, George.

16
00:00:48,712 --> 00:00:51,871
..Wai had already decided to flip sides.

17
00:00:51,912 --> 00:00:53,671
I'm in a state of shock.

18
00:00:53,712 --> 00:00:54,791
The thing is this.

19
00:00:54,832 --> 00:00:57,671
You don't play your idol, no
matter what, and you survive, Cara.

20
00:00:57,712 --> 00:01:03,511
But at tribal council, empath Cara
did play her idol to save George.

21
00:01:07,912 --> 00:01:08,912
And...

22
00:01:10,351 --> 00:01:11,351
Cara.

23
00:01:11,352 --> 00:01:12,871
You're a hero, Cara.

24
00:01:14,312 --> 00:01:16,231
..she was suddenly out of the game.

25
00:01:18,672 --> 00:01:20,231
Or so they thought.

26
00:01:22,152 --> 00:01:25,911
19 are left. Who will
be going home tonight?

27
00:01:51,792 --> 00:01:55,551
"Your tribe may have spoken,
but your game is not over.

28
00:01:55,592 --> 00:01:59,031
"Another tribe is waiting for
you. Take this torch and join."

29
00:02:06,672 --> 00:02:11,911
Jinkies. Onwards and
upwards. Holy guacamole.

30
00:02:12,592 --> 00:02:15,711
I don't even know what
to say. I can't even deal.

31
00:02:15,752 --> 00:02:18,431
I thought it was all over for
sure. I think it's an amazing twist.

32
00:02:28,432 --> 00:02:31,231
Picking my way over rocks
and water, and I'm just...

33
00:02:31,272 --> 00:02:33,151
my head is already spinning.

34
00:02:37,752 --> 00:02:42,711
I'm thinking, how am I going to
be received into the Brawn tribe?

35
00:02:44,632 --> 00:02:46,431
Who knows what's going to happen next?

36
00:02:50,632 --> 00:02:52,231
Hi!

37
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:53,991
Oh, sh...

38
00:02:54,032 --> 00:02:55,591
What's going on?

39
00:02:55,632 --> 00:02:57,871
- Oh, my God.
- Wait, what time is it?

40
00:02:57,912 --> 00:02:59,031
I just wanted you to know.

41
00:03:00,872 --> 00:03:02,111
You are?

42
00:04:38,592 --> 00:04:40,391
I'm superstitious.

43
00:04:40,432 --> 00:04:44,791
The moment we've put that snake skin
on that cow head, we started losing.

44
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:48,711
I'm going to take it
off and see if we win.

45
00:04:48,752 --> 00:04:50,551
Yeah.

46
00:05:07,312 --> 00:05:11,511
We're a resilient bunch
over at Team Brains.

47
00:05:11,552 --> 00:05:13,111
Yeah.

48
00:05:13,152 --> 00:05:16,831
We just keep showing up
with a big smile on our face.

49
00:05:19,472 --> 00:05:23,511
Another crazy tribal council
at the Brains Tribe last night.

50
00:05:23,552 --> 00:05:25,991
Oh, my. It was one for the ages.

51
00:05:26,032 --> 00:05:28,791
There were tears. There was bloodshed.

52
00:05:28,832 --> 00:05:31,391
There was all sorts last night.

53
00:05:31,432 --> 00:05:34,551
We didn't get our man,
Georgie, but we got our girl, Cara.

54
00:05:34,592 --> 00:05:38,471
So I'm sitting here pretty
at the top of my tribe.

55
00:05:38,512 --> 00:05:41,751
It's a good day for man and womankind

56
00:05:41,792 --> 00:05:43,591
out here in the Aussie outback.

57
00:06:04,432 --> 00:06:06,791
Yeah, yeah, 100%. Yeah.

58
00:06:12,432 --> 00:06:14,671
In terms of my alliance,

59
00:06:14,712 --> 00:06:19,511
the pecking order is myself, Laura,
Andrew and Georgia at the top,

60
00:06:19,552 --> 00:06:25,431
Rachel, Hayley and then
last night I've got Wai on board

61
00:06:25,472 --> 00:06:27,311
which is majority.

62
00:06:27,352 --> 00:06:30,391
So I think that I'm the
one calling the shots.

63
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:35,191
I'm the big lion and I'm the big
bad lion, the head of the pride.

64
00:06:36,072 --> 00:06:37,551
I'm running this game.

65
00:06:53,952 --> 00:06:57,911
I'm feeling sad in the camp
this morning, now that Cara is gone.

66
00:06:59,992 --> 00:07:02,631
Last night's tribal
council was my crucifixion.

67
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:06,671
If Cara didn't save me by
playing her idol for me, I was out.

68
00:07:07,792 --> 00:07:10,071
I mean, that is one of the
most honourable things

69
00:07:10,112 --> 00:07:11,991
that someone's ever done.

70
00:07:12,032 --> 00:07:15,151
There were three people
that were loyal on this tribe,

71
00:07:15,192 --> 00:07:18,151
myself, Baden and Cara.

72
00:07:18,192 --> 00:07:20,591
I thought Wai was loyal.

73
00:07:20,632 --> 00:07:24,511
So nothing was more
disappointing at that tribal council

74
00:07:24,552 --> 00:07:26,191
than when Wai flipped.

75
00:07:27,632 --> 00:07:30,471
Wai believed the snake
oil salesman in Joey.

76
00:07:32,272 --> 00:07:34,831
But when I write my book
featuring Joey, my main character,

77
00:07:34,872 --> 00:07:37,391
that's going to be a best seller.

78
00:07:37,432 --> 00:07:39,951
And now my kingdom has fallen.

79
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:42,911
I can't even look her in the eye

80
00:07:42,952 --> 00:07:45,751
because I can't stomach her betrayal.

81
00:07:45,792 --> 00:07:47,551
But I know one thing.

82
00:07:48,712 --> 00:07:51,151
I'm going to confront Wai.

83
00:07:51,192 --> 00:07:53,591
Let's move away.

84
00:08:03,792 --> 00:08:06,431
Why do you have to stab me in the back?

85
00:08:06,472 --> 00:08:09,191
- We were strong, we were loyal.
- I know.

86
00:08:09,232 --> 00:08:11,231
And things just kind
of fell out the other way.

87
00:08:12,432 --> 00:08:15,231
My concern is that you're very volatile.

88
00:08:18,752 --> 00:08:21,231
I know that you've taken
me along this journey,

89
00:08:21,272 --> 00:08:24,951
but it's just been really
frustrating to just feel like

90
00:08:24,992 --> 00:08:27,031
I'm sitting back and being quiet

91
00:08:27,072 --> 00:08:28,711
and just trying to kind
of go with your strategy.

92
00:08:28,752 --> 00:08:30,671
It's still me, Wai.

93
00:08:30,712 --> 00:08:33,231
I will always have a target on my back.

94
00:08:33,272 --> 00:08:34,951
And you'll fight to the death

95
00:08:34,992 --> 00:08:37,671
and continue to bring
chaos to everything.

96
00:08:37,712 --> 00:08:40,471
And I kind of want to
enjoy my time. And I know...

97
00:08:40,512 --> 00:08:42,711
I didn't ask to be frozen out by Joey.

98
00:08:42,752 --> 00:08:45,111
- I didn't ask for that.
- I know you didn't.

99
00:08:45,152 --> 00:08:47,711
But you are causing fallout around you.

100
00:08:48,872 --> 00:08:53,431
I just think that what is going
to make me feel most at peace.

101
00:08:58,672 --> 00:08:59,831
Oh, well.

102
00:09:02,512 --> 00:09:05,271
- I did not expect this from you.
- I know you didn't, George.

103
00:09:05,312 --> 00:09:07,671
I'm going to leave that at that now.

104
00:09:11,472 --> 00:09:15,391
As a result of tribal last night,
emotions are still kind of high.

105
00:09:15,432 --> 00:09:18,791
Things are a little bit awkward,
especially with George and I,

106
00:09:18,832 --> 00:09:22,151
but I finally feel like I made
a move that's right for me.

107
00:09:23,352 --> 00:09:26,951
I took a gamble and a risk
when I made the decision to defect

108
00:09:26,992 --> 00:09:29,711
from the minor alliance
to the majority alliance.

109
00:09:29,752 --> 00:09:32,791
I did feel in the beginning
that I had to align myself

110
00:09:32,832 --> 00:09:35,431
with George just because I owed him,

111
00:09:35,472 --> 00:09:38,551
because of the fact that he
saved me from the first tribal.

112
00:09:39,792 --> 00:09:43,111
But I'm not here to play
anyone else's game but my own

113
00:09:43,152 --> 00:09:46,391
and George, his game has
just become quite volatile

114
00:09:46,432 --> 00:09:48,511
and difficult to work with.

115
00:09:48,552 --> 00:09:51,311
So I'm happy to be
separated from George.

116
00:09:51,352 --> 00:09:57,351
I took some control last night and
I'm stepping up my survival game.

117
00:10:11,992 --> 00:10:14,671
One, under, two, three.

118
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:24,511
How pretty is the red?

119
00:10:24,552 --> 00:10:28,631
I am delighted to be
rocking the Brawn tribe path.

120
00:10:31,912 --> 00:10:36,191
I'm in the stronger tribe,
which is... very pleasant.

121
00:10:38,272 --> 00:10:39,551
Breakfast.

122
00:10:39,592 --> 00:10:42,391
I'm the luckiest person in the world.

123
00:10:42,432 --> 00:10:44,151
So fancy.

124
00:10:44,192 --> 00:10:45,911
Because it's got that lemongrass in it.

125
00:10:45,952 --> 00:10:47,951
This is delicious.

126
00:10:47,992 --> 00:10:49,911
Did you roast the almonds too?

127
00:10:51,032 --> 00:10:53,111
This is how the other half live.

128
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:56,631
The luxury in the Brawn tribe is beyond.

129
00:10:56,672 --> 00:10:59,271
They've got forks, for God's sake,

130
00:10:59,312 --> 00:11:01,191
which can also be used as brushes.

131
00:11:01,232 --> 00:11:04,471
I've just found out we've
even got serving plates.

132
00:11:06,752 --> 00:11:09,551
They've got yoga and boxing.

133
00:11:09,592 --> 00:11:11,031
Relax your shoulder, more hip.

134
00:11:11,072 --> 00:11:12,311
And dance class.

135
00:11:12,352 --> 00:11:15,751
To the left, to the back.

136
00:11:15,792 --> 00:11:18,751
I really have gone from
Survivor hell to Survivor heaven,

137
00:11:18,792 --> 00:11:21,111
and I'm so happy.

138
00:11:21,152 --> 00:11:23,551
I feel like I've actually
just landed home.

139
00:11:24,912 --> 00:11:29,031
I played my idol to save George
at last night's tribal council.

140
00:11:29,072 --> 00:11:31,791
And I thought I was
voted out of the game.

141
00:11:31,832 --> 00:11:34,151
I can't wait to see
the look on their faces

142
00:11:34,192 --> 00:11:37,111
when the Brains tribe
realise that I'm still here.

143
00:11:37,152 --> 00:11:38,431
Hi, baby.

144
00:11:38,472 --> 00:11:43,111
Joey and Laura are the ones
who got me voted out last night.

145
00:11:43,152 --> 00:11:46,911
So I'm going to start just
spilling the beans on everything.

146
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:52,591
Joey and Laura are pretty
much spearheading everything.

147
00:11:52,631 --> 00:11:53,631
Really?

148
00:11:53,632 --> 00:11:56,431
Yeah, and then they keep talking
about how they feel a bit more adult

149
00:11:56,472 --> 00:11:58,591
because, you know,
they're doing all these things

150
00:11:58,632 --> 00:12:00,551
and they're acting like children.

151
00:12:02,392 --> 00:12:05,271
And George, he's really loyal.

152
00:12:05,312 --> 00:12:10,711
Basically, there's a lot of
not... not so niceness over there.

153
00:12:10,752 --> 00:12:12,071
Really?

154
00:12:12,112 --> 00:12:13,871
We're going to have fun
when we see him again.

155
00:12:13,912 --> 00:12:15,551
That we've got to discuss, hey?

156
00:12:17,432 --> 00:12:21,311
It's quite clear that Cara's
allegiance is to the Brawn tribe.

157
00:12:21,352 --> 00:12:22,911
And she's a little bit on the outer.

158
00:12:22,952 --> 00:12:27,231
Although I'm in the minority
with Emmett, Dani and Chelsea

159
00:12:27,272 --> 00:12:29,231
this gives me a lot of confidence.

160
00:12:29,272 --> 00:12:32,431
With Cara joining our tribe it
means there's another number

161
00:12:32,472 --> 00:12:34,311
that's up for grabs, which is huge.

162
00:12:34,352 --> 00:12:38,151
So to get her to join our
alliance is another vote

163
00:12:38,192 --> 00:12:39,991
that we can use moving forward.

164
00:12:41,832 --> 00:12:46,391
I didn't tell George at all that I
was going to use my idol on him.

165
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:49,791
Oh, OK. So George should have
gone. You played your idol for him.

166
00:12:49,832 --> 00:12:50,911
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

167
00:12:50,952 --> 00:12:55,151
We need her because my alliance
of four then becomes a majority.

168
00:12:56,832 --> 00:12:59,271
I would have stayed, but
I'm about building people up.

169
00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:01,391
I'm certainly not about
cutting people down.

170
00:13:01,432 --> 00:13:04,431
Yeah. I've got two
idols in my back pocket.

171
00:13:04,472 --> 00:13:06,751
I just need to make
sure that I've got Cara.

172
00:13:06,792 --> 00:13:08,271
And then we're sweet.

173
00:13:08,312 --> 00:13:10,631
I think Cara is going to be
an easy one to pull across.

174
00:13:24,912 --> 00:13:27,191
One tribe's loss is another one's gain.

175
00:13:28,352 --> 00:13:33,191
And for me, Cara, is a hot commodity
and I'm making a beeline for her.

176
00:13:50,032 --> 00:13:51,032
Oh, I don't know.

177
00:13:55,832 --> 00:13:57,991
Simon and I feel like mum and dad

178
00:13:58,032 --> 00:14:00,751
of two different alliances in this tribe

179
00:14:00,792 --> 00:14:03,231
and Cara is an extra vote for whoever

180
00:14:03,272 --> 00:14:05,871
can pocket her in their alliance.

181
00:14:05,912 --> 00:14:09,031
I'm a big player and I
want her on my side.

182
00:14:09,072 --> 00:14:12,631
If Simon gets her, then I'm in
deep trouble, so I need to make sure

183
00:14:12,672 --> 00:14:14,431
I get there first.

184
00:14:14,472 --> 00:14:16,991
Warm it up, warm it up, warm
it up, warm it up, warm it up.

185
00:14:17,032 --> 00:14:18,991
- I!
- I!

186
00:14:19,032 --> 00:14:20,711
- I believe!
- I believe!

187
00:14:20,752 --> 00:14:23,311
- I believe that we will win!
- I believe that we will win!

188
00:14:23,352 --> 00:14:25,431
I believe that we will win!

189
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,198
Come on in, guys.

190
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:10,958
Brains getting your first
look at the new Brawn Tribe.

191
00:15:22,999 --> 00:15:26,238
Cara, joining Brawn
after last night's tribal.

192
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:29,878
Oh, my God, Cara!

193
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:34,758
Cara, I'm so happy to see you.

194
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:36,638
I'm sure I'm the only
one happy to see you.

195
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:38,038
We're happy here.

196
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:40,038
Maybe you actually heard
what happens on this tribe.

197
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:41,318
It sounds horrible.

198
00:15:41,359 --> 00:15:44,078
George, George. Your loss, our gain.

199
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:47,838
Huge gain for you. You gained a legend.

200
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:55,238
So, Cara. Have you had time to
process what happened last night?

201
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,518
It took a little while
to process for sure.

202
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:02,518
I have been accepted and
welcomed with fully open arms.

203
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:05,718
And I was thinking this is
actually what I signed up for.

204
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:08,718
Not the Brawn tribe,
but just the heart tribe.

205
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:11,278
Like, I just actually
feel really at home.

206
00:16:13,159 --> 00:16:15,598
Simon, how does it feel
having a new tribe mate?

207
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:18,398
You know, it's really cool
just how well that Cara has fit

208
00:16:18,439 --> 00:16:20,758
into this tribe in such
a short amount of time.

209
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:22,438
It's almost like she
was meant to be here.

210
00:16:22,479 --> 00:16:24,678
So very much so one team, one dream.

211
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:28,118
Alright. You guys ready to
get to today's reward challenge?

212
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,398
Yes.

213
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:35,198
In today's challenge, you're
each going to hold a rope

214
00:16:35,239 --> 00:16:36,838
attached to a heavy barrel.

215
00:16:38,199 --> 00:16:41,998
If you tire, you can tap out and
hand your rope to someone else.

216
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:44,758
But once you do that,
you can't come back in.

217
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:47,838
If you drop your barrel
and it hits the ground,

218
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:52,078
the entire tribe is
out of the challenge.

219
00:16:52,119 --> 00:16:57,238
Last tribe with all their
barrels in the air, wins reward.

220
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:59,878
- Want to know what you're playing for?
- Yes!

221
00:17:01,239 --> 00:17:03,438
Good old fashioned...

222
00:17:03,479 --> 00:17:06,478
Aussie barbecue.

223
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,198
I'm not even going to ask
if this is worth playing for.

224
00:17:15,239 --> 00:17:16,358
Oh, yeah.

225
00:17:16,399 --> 00:17:19,038
Alright. Brawn, today,
you have an extra player.

226
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,358
You're gonna need to sit someone out.

227
00:17:20,399 --> 00:17:22,158
Cannot be the same person
in back to back challenges.

228
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:24,238
Who's it gonna be?

229
00:17:24,279 --> 00:17:25,838
Well, I'm the weakest I don't mind.

230
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:28,678
We'll get you fit, don't you worry.

231
00:17:28,719 --> 00:17:30,758
OK, Cara, you're on the bench.

232
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,158
Everyone else, I'll give you a
minute to strategise. Let's get to it.

233
00:17:36,999 --> 00:17:39,598
- Brawn on three!
- One, two three, Brawn!

234
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:47,238
Alright, for reward,
this challenge is now on.

235
00:17:50,439 --> 00:17:54,158
Everyone's locked and loaded,
holding up a heavy barrel.

236
00:17:55,759 --> 00:17:58,878
To make it fair, each tribe
is holding a percentage

237
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:00,798
of their collective weight.

238
00:18:02,479 --> 00:18:05,038
If at any point, it
gets too much for you,

239
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:07,318
you can hand it off to someone else,

240
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:10,958
but you have to have one hand
on the ring at any given time.

241
00:18:10,999 --> 00:18:15,398
If you do that too soon, you
risk overloading your tribe mate.

242
00:18:15,439 --> 00:18:19,478
If you wait too long, you
risk dropping the barrel

243
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:23,238
and then your whole tribe misses
out on that Aussie barbecue.

244
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:24,918
It's hot today.

245
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:30,238
That's going to make
it a little more difficult.

246
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:32,758
Flies. They're out in full force.

247
00:18:36,399 --> 00:18:39,838
Brains hasn't won a
reward in over two weeks.

248
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:44,958
Wai working really hard, trying
to hold in as long as she can.

249
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:46,518
Andrew, you good?

250
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:52,438
Drop it like it's hot, Wai.

251
00:18:52,479 --> 00:18:54,918
Brawn targeting Wai.

252
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:06,518
Brawn feeling very confident today.

253
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:15,358
Andrew coaching her through.

254
00:19:21,959 --> 00:19:24,318
Andrew takes Wai's barrel.

255
00:19:24,359 --> 00:19:26,238
Thank you, Andrew.

256
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:28,078
And Wai is out of the challenge.

257
00:19:29,879 --> 00:19:33,438
We're one down. Dun, dun, daaa!

258
00:19:33,479 --> 00:19:36,518
Andrew first with two
barrels on the Brains tribe.

259
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:40,198
They've gone 19 minutes
further than I thought they would.

260
00:19:40,239 --> 00:19:41,278
True dat.

261
00:19:41,319 --> 00:19:43,078
You're looking strong, George.

262
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:47,678
That's one of the first nice things
someone said to me for days,

263
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:48,918
so thank you.

264
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:10,638
Shannon taps out.

265
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:12,838
Hands her barrel to Simon.

266
00:20:14,879 --> 00:20:18,558
And just like that, Shannon
is out of the challenge.

267
00:20:50,839 --> 00:20:52,918
You guys have been at it for 30 minutes.

268
00:20:52,959 --> 00:20:54,838
Whoo-hoo!

269
00:20:55,439 --> 00:20:58,078
Emmett takes a barrel from Simon.

270
00:21:01,439 --> 00:21:03,198
Baden handing back to Rachel.

271
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:07,358
Oh, very close to losing it.

272
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:09,118
Not even.

273
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:12,798
Rachel carrying all the
weight now for Brains.

274
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:14,918
Don't hurt yourself.

275
00:21:14,959 --> 00:21:17,558
Georgia really struggling now.

276
00:21:19,439 --> 00:21:20,838
Georgia could be in trouble.

277
00:21:20,879 --> 00:21:24,318
Brains are feeling the
weight of all those barrels.

278
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:25,758
You've got this, Georgia.

279
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:36,318
Brawn, having a party over there.

280
00:21:40,039 --> 00:21:43,158
Oh, hey!

281
00:21:44,839 --> 00:21:48,318
Right, guys, you've
been at it for one hour.

282
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:51,798
- Nice work, guys.
- Yes, Brawn.

283
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:53,398
Staying strong.

284
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:03,598
Baden coming back
in, offering some relief.

285
00:22:20,999 --> 00:22:22,598
Big D's in the house.

286
00:22:30,839 --> 00:22:33,678
Simon handing off to
Chelsea, handing off to Daini.

287
00:22:36,239 --> 00:22:37,878
Hey, Chelsea!

288
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:42,638
You have to have one hand
on the ring at any given time.

289
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:48,598
And you had both hands
free during the transfer.

290
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:50,519
You're out.

291
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:54,638
- Alright, we're in good shape, guys.
- We're in good shape, come on.

292
00:22:55,279 --> 00:22:56,518
Sorry.

293
00:23:02,199 --> 00:23:06,398
Emmett, inching his
way over, hands it to Dani.

294
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:09,038
Danny to Gerald.

295
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:12,038
Daini, back to Simon.

296
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:14,118
Lots of transfers for Brawn.

297
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:21,358
Dani really struggling now.

298
00:23:32,439 --> 00:23:33,678
You right?

299
00:23:33,719 --> 00:23:35,438
Two, one.

300
00:23:35,719 --> 00:23:39,078
Dani drops out, hands
her barrel to Emmett.

301
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,358
Oh, yes, yes, we got this, guys.

302
00:23:42,399 --> 00:23:45,038
Brawn have six players now.

303
00:23:54,959 --> 00:23:57,158
- Brains still have eight.
- Whoo!

304
00:23:57,199 --> 00:23:59,238
That is a distinct advantage.

305
00:24:00,999 --> 00:24:03,478
Emmett handing back to Gerald.

306
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:06,238
Gerald has two, Simon has two.

307
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:07,438
Daini has two.

308
00:24:08,639 --> 00:24:09,998
I've got to help Daini out.

309
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:13,758
They're running out of options now.

310
00:24:14,759 --> 00:24:15,759
Come on.

311
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:20,438
We are 90 minutes into this challenge.

312
00:24:20,479 --> 00:24:23,318
Yeah, all day!

313
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:24,958
Let's do another 90. Come on!

314
00:24:24,999 --> 00:24:27,358
- 90 more!
- Things are really heating up.

315
00:24:32,119 --> 00:24:35,198
Gerald struggling
with those two barrels.

316
00:24:35,239 --> 00:24:37,318
- Come on, Gezza.
- Trying to keep them up.

317
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:40,758
We are so close to what we
wanted, an Aussie barbecue.

318
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:42,078
Let's just keep going.

319
00:24:45,719 --> 00:24:47,878
No one wants to be responsible

320
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:49,998
for losing all that
protein over at Brawn.

321
00:25:00,679 --> 00:25:03,238
Guys, guys. Focus on ourselves. Focus.

322
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:05,118
Gerald at full stretch.

323
00:25:06,199 --> 00:25:07,598
Groaning in pain.

324
00:25:11,639 --> 00:25:13,038
All day, guys, all day.

325
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:16,198
Really trying to find
that strength to hold in.

326
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:19,838
Gerald buckled over.

327
00:25:20,959 --> 00:25:22,238
Giving it everything.

328
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:32,718
One hand for Gerald.

329
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:39,398
Really stretching to
get both hands on it.

330
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:42,558
Big dig from Gerald.

331
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:51,598
Oh, that's it!

332
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:53,799
Let the barrels go.

333
00:25:55,159 --> 00:25:59,158
And Brains win their first reward!

334
00:26:09,879 --> 00:26:12,478
Brains, congratulations.

335
00:26:12,519 --> 00:26:16,478
You finally did it. You won
probably the best reward so far.

336
00:26:16,518 --> 00:26:17,518
Barbie!

337
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:20,998
Well done. It'll be waiting for you
back at camp, head on out. Enjoy.

338
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:22,758
Thanks, guys. Thank you.

339
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:25,078
Brawn, great effort.

340
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:28,558
But for the first time this
season, got nothing for you.

341
00:26:28,599 --> 00:26:30,918
- Grab your gear, head on out.
- Thanks. See ya.

342
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:39,958
Finally, we won a reward
and we've won the best reward ever.

343
00:26:39,999 --> 00:26:42,478
A bloody barbecue!

344
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:44,878
We really put our
bodies on the line today,

345
00:26:44,919 --> 00:26:49,718
which has actually made the
victory taste a little bit sweeter.

346
00:26:49,759 --> 00:26:52,838
There's only so far that rice and
lentils can get a woman, you know.

347
00:27:06,655 --> 00:27:08,381
Oh, my God.

348
00:27:08,381 --> 00:27:11,020
Oh, my gosh.

349
00:27:14,881 --> 00:27:17,980
Welcome to the winner's circle!

350
00:27:21,106 --> 00:27:23,182
This is amazing.

351
00:27:23,182 --> 00:27:24,782
Oh, wow.

352
00:27:24,782 --> 00:27:26,466
Wow.

353
00:27:26,466 --> 00:27:28,340
Let's get into it.

354
00:27:28,614 --> 00:27:32,373
This is the first proper
food we've eaten in 15 days.

355
00:27:32,414 --> 00:27:35,133
- Oh, salt!
- Whoo!

356
00:27:35,174 --> 00:27:38,013
- That could not have been better. - Oh!

357
00:27:38,054 --> 00:27:40,933
There was green salad and potato salad.

358
00:27:40,974 --> 00:27:43,653
We had vegetable skewers and chops.

359
00:27:44,774 --> 00:27:46,613
I'm just going to keep eating.

360
00:27:46,654 --> 00:27:50,853
I feel like this barbecue
could fuel us forever.

361
00:27:50,894 --> 00:27:52,693
Oh, yeah.

362
00:27:53,934 --> 00:27:55,293
Oh, my God.

363
00:27:55,334 --> 00:27:58,853
The lemonade! Give me
more of that lemonade.

364
00:27:58,894 --> 00:28:02,293
That was amazing. Tasted like heaven.

365
00:28:02,334 --> 00:28:04,493
Cheers. Cin-cin.

366
00:28:07,814 --> 00:28:10,653
First bite of that frittata

367
00:28:10,694 --> 00:28:14,213
was like an angel peeing in your mouth.

368
00:28:14,254 --> 00:28:16,493
It was delicious.

369
00:28:16,534 --> 00:28:20,493
It's just the fuel and the energy
we really need to keep on winning.

370
00:28:20,534 --> 00:28:24,533
We can beat the Brawn tribe
and we can outbrawn them

371
00:28:24,574 --> 00:28:26,133
and outbrain them.

372
00:28:31,014 --> 00:28:33,253
I slayed that reward today.

373
00:28:34,214 --> 00:28:36,853
We ate that meat like
a pack of carnivores.

374
00:28:36,894 --> 00:28:39,693
For 15 days, the Brains tribe

375
00:28:39,734 --> 00:28:43,493
has been licking rice and
lentils and beans off a rock.

376
00:28:43,534 --> 00:28:46,253
If this is going to be my last night,

377
00:28:46,294 --> 00:28:48,813
I'm going to eat as much
of the food as possible.

378
00:28:54,214 --> 00:28:55,813
Did you recognise her
when she was walking in?

379
00:28:55,854 --> 00:28:57,013
No, I didn't.

380
00:28:58,454 --> 00:29:01,733
Today at the challenge, the
shock of my life happened.

381
00:29:01,774 --> 00:29:04,413
Cara popped up in the Brawn Tribe.

382
00:29:04,454 --> 00:29:06,253
Cara's my closest ally

383
00:29:06,294 --> 00:29:08,453
and I'm delighted that she's still in.

384
00:29:10,014 --> 00:29:13,253
Oh, my goodness, I
thought I got rid of Cara.

385
00:29:13,294 --> 00:29:15,973
I thought, I've got rid of
George all these times.

386
00:29:16,014 --> 00:29:18,333
Who wants half a sausage?

387
00:29:18,374 --> 00:29:22,253
They just keep coming back
from the dead. This is crazy.

388
00:30:19,054 --> 00:30:21,893
Right now, it's
become very clear to me

389
00:30:21,934 --> 00:30:26,253
that there are big players always
making big moves in this tribe.

390
00:30:26,294 --> 00:30:28,013
A massive part of this game

391
00:30:28,054 --> 00:30:30,133
is that you have to be
able to outwit people.

392
00:30:30,174 --> 00:30:32,013
You have to be strategic.

393
00:30:33,094 --> 00:30:34,653
I'm a pain researcher.

394
00:30:34,694 --> 00:30:37,693
That means you get to manipulate
the way people are thinking.

395
00:30:37,734 --> 00:30:39,973
So I have a really good read on people.

396
00:30:40,014 --> 00:30:43,373
I think that my plan of coming
in here and getting everyone

397
00:30:43,414 --> 00:30:45,453
to trust me has worked.

398
00:30:48,014 --> 00:30:51,173
It's really fun to be out here
and pretend to look easygoing

399
00:30:51,214 --> 00:30:53,533
and not threatening.

400
00:30:54,814 --> 00:30:58,293
Because floating in the
middle is a nice place to be,

401
00:30:58,334 --> 00:31:02,213
but there's no way I came here to
just be a number for someone else.

402
00:31:02,254 --> 00:31:09,013
So I want to find a way to make a
move and take control of this game.

403
00:31:10,414 --> 00:31:12,493
Because I am here to win.

404
00:31:27,974 --> 00:31:30,053
Well done, guys.

405
00:31:30,094 --> 00:31:32,053
Good evening, jocks.

406
00:31:32,094 --> 00:31:37,053
Honestly, every one of us
there went as hard as we could.

407
00:31:37,894 --> 00:31:41,613
The main thing is that we
keep... get up back on our horse

408
00:31:41,654 --> 00:31:43,013
and keep going.

409
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:49,493
I lost the challenge for the team.

410
00:31:50,774 --> 00:31:52,053
At the end of the day,

411
00:31:52,094 --> 00:31:55,093
it was me that let go of
those handles and I think

412
00:31:55,134 --> 00:31:57,453
I might be on the chopping block.

413
00:32:01,654 --> 00:32:04,493
The Brawns tribe dug so deep today.

414
00:32:04,534 --> 00:32:06,333
We didn't win the reward

415
00:32:06,374 --> 00:32:10,493
and I can just feel there are
a few fractures in the tribe.

416
00:32:10,534 --> 00:32:14,373
My ability to read people
is my secret weapon.

417
00:32:16,294 --> 00:32:18,493
And I'm always looking for opportunity

418
00:32:18,534 --> 00:32:20,173
to use my empath skills.

419
00:32:20,214 --> 00:32:23,893
The other part that's kind of odd,
but interesting, good party trick

420
00:32:23,934 --> 00:32:26,613
- is that I'm an empath.
- So cool.

421
00:32:27,894 --> 00:32:32,173
And right now, I think it's a
really good time to use them

422
00:32:32,214 --> 00:32:35,213
because we need to
galvanise the tribe together.

423
00:32:37,014 --> 00:32:38,533
so I can literally just touch people

424
00:32:38,574 --> 00:32:40,333
and feel pain in their
bodies and stuff like that.

425
00:32:43,974 --> 00:32:45,173
Ooh, that's weird.

426
00:32:45,214 --> 00:32:47,293
I'm just going to check on that,
because that sounds weird, but.

427
00:32:51,214 --> 00:32:55,693
These ones. That. What's that from?

428
00:32:57,974 --> 00:32:59,093
Oh, really?

429
00:33:02,334 --> 00:33:10,334
Yeah, I just get full
activation around here.

430
00:33:15,734 --> 00:33:17,773
You're kind of spot on,
never injured myself.

431
00:33:17,814 --> 00:33:18,893
Really?

432
00:33:18,934 --> 00:33:21,853
Yeah, and the only
thing that's on my mind

433
00:33:21,894 --> 00:33:23,973
and has been for the last two
years is probably having kids.

434
00:33:24,014 --> 00:33:25,893
- And what that means.
- Yeah, that's what I feel.

435
00:33:28,254 --> 00:33:29,453
Now I'm a little teary.

436
00:33:33,134 --> 00:33:35,133
Wow, like I'm in shock.

437
00:33:36,494 --> 00:33:41,453
Cara's ability to pick up on
people's emotions and pain,

438
00:33:41,494 --> 00:33:42,853
it works.

439
00:33:42,894 --> 00:33:45,493
You need that positive
energy in your tribe.

440
00:33:45,534 --> 00:33:47,293
It's cool. It's so cool.

441
00:33:50,214 --> 00:33:53,973
I know Shannon
has taken to pull Cara in close.

442
00:33:54,774 --> 00:33:57,253
It is so crucial that I
get Cara in my side,

443
00:33:57,294 --> 00:34:00,413
especially before we go to
the next immunity challenge.

444
00:34:02,014 --> 00:34:04,373
To get her to join our alliance,

445
00:34:04,414 --> 00:34:08,813
it's really important to ensure
that I have a connection with her,

446
00:34:08,854 --> 00:34:11,293
but I haven't had a really
good chance to chat to her yet.

447
00:34:11,334 --> 00:34:13,533
So first things first.

448
00:34:13,574 --> 00:34:16,373
I need to form a bond with Cara.

449
00:34:16,414 --> 00:34:20,613
She's the kind of person that
has a lot of emotional intelligence.

450
00:34:20,654 --> 00:34:23,773
So I'm going to choose very
carefully and be very strategic

451
00:34:23,814 --> 00:34:25,253
about how I approach this.

452
00:34:28,534 --> 00:34:29,693
And...

453
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:32,333
How are all the women when
they go through menopause?

454
00:34:35,054 --> 00:34:36,613
Umm...

455
00:34:39,814 --> 00:34:43,533
I went through early.
So I went through, like 43.

456
00:34:43,574 --> 00:34:45,333
Yep.

457
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:48,293
Um... and that was hard.

458
00:34:48,334 --> 00:34:49,493
Yeah.

459
00:34:51,614 --> 00:34:54,853
And look at you now, hey? Out here.

460
00:34:57,214 --> 00:35:02,293
Simon is a strong player, but
he is no match when it comes

461
00:35:02,334 --> 00:35:03,893
to my social game.

462
00:35:04,654 --> 00:35:08,653
If we lose the next
challenge and we go to tribal.

463
00:35:10,774 --> 00:35:13,293
Simon is the only thing on my radar.

464
00:35:39,661 --> 00:35:41,904
Come on in, guys.

465
00:35:51,695 --> 00:35:53,906
- Joey.
- Yo.

466
00:35:53,992 --> 00:35:57,831
It's been a long time coming. Was
the reward as good as you imagined?

467
00:35:57,872 --> 00:35:59,871
Six in a row. Six losses.

468
00:35:59,912 --> 00:36:01,831
Yeah, we still showed up yesterday.

469
00:36:01,872 --> 00:36:04,271
We still bought it and we got the win

470
00:36:04,312 --> 00:36:06,751
and victory tasted oh, so sweet.

471
00:36:10,072 --> 00:36:12,671
Cara, on the other
hand, you're the only one

472
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:14,911
who hasn't enjoyed a reward.

473
00:36:14,952 --> 00:36:17,111
- That's got to suck.
- A little bit.

474
00:36:17,152 --> 00:36:18,591
Yeah, I was a little bit disappointed,

475
00:36:18,632 --> 00:36:20,351
but I'm not so food-based.

476
00:36:20,392 --> 00:36:21,671
I'm love and heart-based.

477
00:36:23,072 --> 00:36:25,471
Alright, you guys ready to get
to today's immunity challenge?

478
00:36:25,511 --> 00:36:26,511
Yes.

479
00:36:26,512 --> 00:36:28,311
Hell, yeah, that's what I like to hear.

480
00:36:29,552 --> 00:36:31,431
Thank you, sir.

481
00:36:31,472 --> 00:36:34,911
Once again, immunity
is back up for grabs.

482
00:36:36,272 --> 00:36:37,631
For today's challenge,

483
00:36:37,672 --> 00:36:40,631
you're going to race up
a ramp to collect ropes.

484
00:36:40,672 --> 00:36:44,951
Two of you will use those
ropes to build a rope bridge.

485
00:36:44,992 --> 00:36:49,111
Allowing the rest of the tribe
to cross over, climb up a tower

486
00:36:49,152 --> 00:36:50,911
and retrieve an idol.

487
00:36:50,952 --> 00:36:54,911
Once you have your idol, you
make your way under a cargo net

488
00:36:54,952 --> 00:36:57,751
to collect your last pieces
of rope from a high rail.

489
00:36:59,712 --> 00:37:05,751
Finally, four of you will use that
rope to hoist your idol up to a hook.

490
00:37:09,232 --> 00:37:14,431
First tribe to hook their idol
wins immunity, safe from the vote.

491
00:37:14,472 --> 00:37:17,511
Losers, tribal council, where
somebody is going to become

492
00:37:17,552 --> 00:37:18,991
the sixth person voted out.

493
00:37:19,832 --> 00:37:22,991
Brawn, you got an extra player
you're gonna need to sit someone out.

494
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:25,191
Cannot be the same person
in back to back challenges.

495
00:37:25,232 --> 00:37:26,311
Who is it gonna be?

496
00:37:26,352 --> 00:37:28,951
You're gonna need height, so
I'm gonna be the one jumping up.

497
00:37:32,592 --> 00:37:35,751
Dani, you're on the bench,
everyone else a minute to strategise.

498
00:37:35,792 --> 00:37:36,951
Let's get to it.

499
00:37:40,832 --> 00:37:43,631
Alright, here we go, for immunity.

500
00:37:45,072 --> 00:37:47,471
Oh, actually, hang on,
there's one more thing.

501
00:37:47,512 --> 00:37:48,671
Oh, here we go.

502
00:37:50,072 --> 00:37:53,751
There is a hidden immunity
idol on the course today.

503
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:57,991
Oh, gosh.

504
00:37:58,672 --> 00:38:01,471
It's hidden at the big Survivor logo.

505
00:38:01,512 --> 00:38:04,391
So if you want it or need
it, go ahead and grab it.

506
00:38:04,432 --> 00:38:07,631
But in doing so, you could
cost your whole tribe immunity.

507
00:38:09,392 --> 00:38:10,392
Survivors, ready.

508
00:38:10,832 --> 00:38:11,832
Go!

509
00:38:13,352 --> 00:38:16,071
The first thing you need
to do is collect all the ropes.

510
00:38:16,112 --> 00:38:19,311
That'll clear a path through the
obstacle so you can all move through.

511
00:38:21,592 --> 00:38:23,431
Brawn have half of theirs.

512
00:38:23,472 --> 00:38:25,911
- Run.
- Go through. Go through, go through.

513
00:38:25,952 --> 00:38:28,151
Brain have half of theirs.

514
00:38:28,192 --> 00:38:30,311
Brains are working quickly today.

515
00:38:33,512 --> 00:38:36,631
Everyone needs to be on your
mat before you can move on.

516
00:38:37,912 --> 00:38:39,511
Run up. You need a run up.

517
00:38:40,072 --> 00:38:42,551
Rachel struggling on
the ramp for Brains.

518
00:38:43,552 --> 00:38:46,071
Right. All on the mat.

519
00:38:47,792 --> 00:38:50,231
Oh, Cara takes a tumble for Brawn.

520
00:38:55,072 --> 00:38:57,471
You good, Brawns? Start
working on your bridge.

521
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:11,711
George quickly breaking
away from his tribe.

522
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:14,951
He's going to have
a search for that idol.

523
00:39:16,552 --> 00:39:17,791
Hayley right on his tail.

524
00:39:19,192 --> 00:39:20,591
What the are they doing?

525
00:39:21,312 --> 00:39:22,911
We've got time. We've got time.

526
00:39:24,752 --> 00:39:26,871
And Gerald breaks away from Brawn.

527
00:39:28,952 --> 00:39:31,551
Three of them furiously
looking for that idol.

528
00:39:35,552 --> 00:39:37,151
Ah, Hayley got it.

529
00:39:37,192 --> 00:39:39,871
Hayley, she finds the idol.

530
00:39:39,912 --> 00:39:41,551
That's it.

531
00:39:43,232 --> 00:39:44,591
Comes back to her tribe.

532
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:49,351
There's a cost to the Brain tribe.

533
00:39:52,352 --> 00:39:55,671
Finally, Brains can
start work on their bridge.

534
00:39:57,392 --> 00:39:59,191
Slow and steady, guys, you got it.

535
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:03,551
Emmett and Simon, working
well together for Brawn.

536
00:40:03,592 --> 00:40:05,791
Have half of their bridge completed.

537
00:40:05,832 --> 00:40:07,751
Good job, guys.

538
00:40:08,872 --> 00:40:11,711
Hayley, she really wants
to make up for lost time now.

539
00:40:11,752 --> 00:40:14,111
There's a few that aren't
sitting flush on the right.

540
00:40:14,152 --> 00:40:15,351
Alright. I'll fix them.

541
00:40:16,512 --> 00:40:19,191
- Alright, you guys ready?
- Go, Brawn.

542
00:40:19,232 --> 00:40:20,511
Alright, here we go.

543
00:40:21,152 --> 00:40:22,551
Simon's across.

544
00:40:23,352 --> 00:40:24,751
Chelsea on the bridge, now.

545
00:40:24,792 --> 00:40:26,191
Move it. That's it.

546
00:40:27,432 --> 00:40:30,271
Hayley is on a mission
in this challenge.

547
00:40:30,312 --> 00:40:31,671
Got immunity for herself.

548
00:40:31,712 --> 00:40:34,071
She wants to get
immunity for her entire tribe.

549
00:40:36,872 --> 00:40:39,751
Brains have their bridge
completed. Andrew going across.

550
00:40:41,112 --> 00:40:42,112
Good job, guys.

551
00:40:44,312 --> 00:40:45,871
Get ready to climb, get ready to climb.

552
00:40:45,912 --> 00:40:47,951
Shannon last on the bridge for Brawn.

553
00:40:47,992 --> 00:40:50,031
Let's go, go, go, go, go.

554
00:40:50,072 --> 00:40:52,351
Brawn's good. You're
across the bridge. Go!

555
00:40:52,391 --> 00:40:53,391
Watch your back, there.

556
00:40:53,392 --> 00:40:56,031
Up that tower. Simon grabs the idol.

557
00:40:59,752 --> 00:41:01,751
Brawn heading under the net, now.

558
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:04,751
Simon, Daini, holding
it up for everyone else.

559
00:41:05,872 --> 00:41:07,991
- Hold it up.
- I'm going through.

560
00:41:08,032 --> 00:41:09,911
Quick, quick, quick.

561
00:41:09,952 --> 00:41:11,431
Can you hold it?

562
00:41:13,712 --> 00:41:16,071
Brawn go through the net,

563
00:41:16,112 --> 00:41:20,111
Kez and Shannon going up to
fetch those final pieces of rope.

564
00:41:25,352 --> 00:41:28,551
- Joey is last for Brains. - Nice, Joey.

565
00:41:28,592 --> 00:41:30,151
Get up that tower!

566
00:41:30,952 --> 00:41:33,591
Everyone needs to be at the
top before you can move on.

567
00:41:34,952 --> 00:41:36,351
OK, you're good, Brains.

568
00:41:36,392 --> 00:41:37,791
Andrew has the idol.

569
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:40,591
Get under that net.

570
00:41:44,232 --> 00:41:46,191
Come on, guys. You got this.

571
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:48,271
You're doing really well.

572
00:41:48,312 --> 00:41:51,751
Brawn have two of their
ropes, working on the last two.

573
00:41:51,792 --> 00:41:52,951
Good work, guys.

574
00:41:53,432 --> 00:41:55,191
Andrew, pull Rach out.

575
00:41:55,232 --> 00:41:56,591
Come on!

576
00:41:56,632 --> 00:42:00,151
Rachel, last to come through
the net for Brains, really struggling.

577
00:42:00,192 --> 00:42:02,151
They drag her through on her belly.

578
00:42:02,192 --> 00:42:05,271
I've got you, Georgia. I've got you.

579
00:42:05,312 --> 00:42:08,711
Shannon, working on
the last rope for Brawn

580
00:42:08,752 --> 00:42:11,391
She's good! You're good, Brawn.

581
00:42:11,432 --> 00:42:13,511
Move on!

582
00:42:13,552 --> 00:42:16,831
Alright now you need to
throw those ropes over the rail.

583
00:42:16,872 --> 00:42:18,071
Here we go.

584
00:42:18,112 --> 00:42:19,631
Yes!

585
00:42:19,672 --> 00:42:21,111
Nice!

586
00:42:21,152 --> 00:42:24,951
Big D has his rope in
place. Simon has his.

587
00:42:24,992 --> 00:42:27,671
You need to pick it up, Brains.

588
00:42:27,712 --> 00:42:29,791
- Right?
- Hold me, hold me.

589
00:42:29,832 --> 00:42:31,671
Just stay there.

590
00:42:31,712 --> 00:42:33,551
That's it.

591
00:42:34,912 --> 00:42:38,871
Gerald has his. Now you
need to clip them under the disc

592
00:42:38,912 --> 00:42:40,391
to lift up that idol.

593
00:42:40,432 --> 00:42:41,911
Guys, nice job.

594
00:42:41,952 --> 00:42:44,911
We've got to take our time
with this so it doesn't fall off.

595
00:42:47,712 --> 00:42:48,951
Don't panic.

596
00:42:49,512 --> 00:42:50,831
Nice and easy.

597
00:42:50,872 --> 00:42:53,151
All ready? Nice and easy.

598
00:42:53,192 --> 00:42:57,471
All you need to do is
hook that idol at the top.

599
00:42:58,592 --> 00:43:01,551
And you get to relax
tonight back at camp.

600
00:43:03,792 --> 00:43:06,031
Gerald, Gerald... Simmo.

601
00:43:06,072 --> 00:43:07,591
- Me, me.
- You, you, you.

602
00:43:07,632 --> 00:43:09,431
Simmo! Simmo and Gerald.

603
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:12,751
Oh, boys.

604
00:43:12,792 --> 00:43:15,711
There's definitely a
learning curve involved here.

605
00:43:15,752 --> 00:43:18,231
You have to work together.

606
00:43:18,272 --> 00:43:19,911
Do you want the girls to have a go?

607
00:43:24,192 --> 00:43:26,591
Finally, Andrew has the last rope.

608
00:43:26,632 --> 00:43:29,191
Go, Brains, you can move on.

609
00:43:29,232 --> 00:43:33,071
Baden, Laura, Joey and George

610
00:43:33,112 --> 00:43:35,991
on the final stage of this challenge,

611
00:43:36,032 --> 00:43:39,471
trying to hook that
rope over that high rail.

612
00:43:40,552 --> 00:43:42,831
That's it, guys. Good work,
Laura. Good work, guys.

613
00:43:42,872 --> 00:43:44,311
George, that's enough.

614
00:43:44,352 --> 00:43:45,631
Click it under your disc.

615
00:43:48,912 --> 00:43:51,351
Three, two, one, go.

616
00:43:52,552 --> 00:43:55,231
Just a tiny bit at a time. Tiny.

617
00:43:55,272 --> 00:43:59,271
Despite Brawn's huge lead,
we are neck and neck again.

618
00:44:02,872 --> 00:44:05,111
Yeah, I think we need
a better technique.

619
00:44:05,152 --> 00:44:08,391
Cara and Chelsea are
subbing in for Brawn.

620
00:44:08,432 --> 00:44:11,991
We're going to get slack and
we're all going to go one at a time.

621
00:44:12,032 --> 00:44:13,032
Yeah.

622
00:44:14,272 --> 00:44:15,951
Alright. Three, two, one, up.

623
00:44:18,392 --> 00:44:20,751
Simon and Chelsea, yep, hold it there.

624
00:44:21,832 --> 00:44:23,551
That's it. Hold it here. Nice.

625
00:44:23,592 --> 00:44:26,071
- Hold it here.
- Maybe they're on to something here.

626
00:44:26,952 --> 00:44:29,391
Three, two, one.

627
00:44:31,352 --> 00:44:34,071
And they go again.

628
00:44:34,112 --> 00:44:36,511
Slower than that. Way
slower than that, man.

629
00:44:36,552 --> 00:44:38,591
Yeah, it's got to be super slow.

630
00:44:39,432 --> 00:44:40,711
What are they doing? Tell us.

631
00:44:40,752 --> 00:44:42,591
Bit by bit. With just one person.

632
00:44:46,312 --> 00:44:49,471
Wai, can you please go a tiny bit?

633
00:44:49,512 --> 00:44:51,631
Wait, wait. Everybody wait.

634
00:44:52,392 --> 00:44:56,151
Brains finally have something
that's looking steady.

635
00:44:57,832 --> 00:45:00,151
Brawn get a little higher again.

636
00:45:00,192 --> 00:45:01,591
Hold, hold, hold.

637
00:45:01,632 --> 00:45:04,831
Cara would really like to
prove herself to her new tribe.

638
00:45:06,832 --> 00:45:10,951
Chelsea and Cara release
as we pull. Three, two, one, go.

639
00:45:10,992 --> 00:45:12,031
That's it.

640
00:45:16,432 --> 00:45:18,231
Slowly down, slowly down.

641
00:45:18,272 --> 00:45:19,272
- Slowly down.
- It's on.

642
00:45:19,312 --> 00:45:21,031
Got it!

643
00:45:21,072 --> 00:45:22,671
That's it!

644
00:45:22,712 --> 00:45:25,351
Brawn win immunity!

645
00:45:32,552 --> 00:45:33,552
Oh, my God!

646
00:45:34,832 --> 00:45:36,311
Good job. Good job.

647
00:45:42,872 --> 00:45:48,271
Brawn, congratulations.
Once again, immunity is yours.

648
00:45:48,312 --> 00:45:51,311
She made us work for
it, but she's coming home.

649
00:45:53,632 --> 00:45:55,871
Well done. You guys are safe tonight.

650
00:45:55,912 --> 00:45:58,351
Nobody going home,
grab your gear, head on out.

651
00:45:58,392 --> 00:46:01,231
- Enjoy your night off.
- Thank you, guys.

652
00:46:03,992 --> 00:46:06,511
Alright, Brains. Tribal council
again tonight, where one

653
00:46:06,552 --> 00:46:09,271
of you will become the sixth person
voted out of the Australian Survivor

654
00:46:09,312 --> 00:46:10,711
Brains vs Brawn.

655
00:46:10,752 --> 00:46:13,591
Grab your gear, head on
out. I'll see you guys tonight.

656
00:46:13,632 --> 00:46:15,431
See you tonight.

657
00:46:18,232 --> 00:46:22,191
Kind of sucks that we
lost, but I've got something in store.

658
00:46:22,912 --> 00:46:25,871
I have an idol now and I'm
ready to blow up the game.

659
00:46:26,552 --> 00:46:28,751
Tribal tonight will be fireworks.

660
00:46:48,027 --> 00:46:49,940
- Here, guys.
- I'm stuffed.

661
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:51,980
Oh, well.

662
00:46:55,701 --> 00:46:57,380
It is what it is.

663
00:46:57,380 --> 00:46:58,580
We'll win the next one.

664
00:46:58,715 --> 00:47:02,141
I've got dirt in places
I've never had dirt before.

665
00:47:03,996 --> 00:47:05,355
So shall we swim, people? Let's swim.

666
00:47:05,396 --> 00:47:06,995
Let's swim.

667
00:47:07,036 --> 00:47:09,395
Wash away our loss.

668
00:47:09,436 --> 00:47:11,675
- Yes.
- We tried that one.

669
00:47:13,116 --> 00:47:17,155
Unfortunately, we came up short
today in the immunity challenge.

670
00:47:17,196 --> 00:47:19,795
So we're off to tribal
tonight to see what happens.

671
00:47:43,716 --> 00:47:45,155
Obviously I want George out

672
00:47:45,196 --> 00:47:47,075
and I think the tribe
will be stronger for it.

673
00:47:47,116 --> 00:47:48,555
He is dangerous in this game.

674
00:47:48,596 --> 00:47:51,035
He is a strategic player
and that is a threat.

675
00:47:51,076 --> 00:47:53,795
So tonight, Georgie is going home.

676
00:48:06,596 --> 00:48:09,755
So we vote George,
we're obviously splitting.

677
00:48:09,796 --> 00:48:12,475
We're 100% splitting. Secondary...

678
00:48:14,236 --> 00:48:15,236
Wai.

679
00:48:15,836 --> 00:48:18,795
I feel a little bit bad because
I did bring Wai into the fold,

680
00:48:18,836 --> 00:48:22,315
you know, for the tribal two nights
ago, and she gave us the numbers

681
00:48:22,356 --> 00:48:24,635
we needed, but I think
it served its purpose.

682
00:48:25,316 --> 00:48:29,715
So tonight, if George plays
an idol, Wai is going home.

683
00:48:29,756 --> 00:48:32,075
OK. So we got it sorted.

684
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:35,515
I think it's as
straightforward as it gets.

685
00:48:36,236 --> 00:48:38,275
Look, at the end of the
day, everyone's coming to me

686
00:48:38,316 --> 00:48:41,355
to come up with the strategies
because I got the moves.

687
00:48:41,396 --> 00:48:45,435
I'm playing chess. They
playing checkers.

688
00:48:54,836 --> 00:48:57,235
Oh, well, congratulations, Hayley.

689
00:48:57,276 --> 00:49:00,515
That idol's gonna probably propel
you to the top three or four now.

690
00:49:00,556 --> 00:49:02,635
That would be fantastic.

691
00:49:02,676 --> 00:49:04,315
Are you gonna play it for me tonight?

692
00:49:04,876 --> 00:49:07,035
Stranger things have happened.

693
00:49:07,076 --> 00:49:09,195
Well, it was worth asking.

694
00:49:10,876 --> 00:49:12,355
Famous last words, mate.

695
00:49:14,316 --> 00:49:15,875
Oh, it is a breath of fresh air

696
00:49:15,916 --> 00:49:18,075
to know that Hayley got
to that idol before George.

697
00:49:18,116 --> 00:49:20,795
Hayley is definitely
someone I feel like I can trust.

698
00:49:20,836 --> 00:49:23,515
At the end of the day, one of
my alliance members has it.

699
00:49:23,556 --> 00:49:25,835
George doesn't have
it, which is the big thing.

700
00:49:25,876 --> 00:49:29,555
So I feel like it's in my back
pocket whenever I need it.

701
00:49:29,596 --> 00:49:32,315
I am the puppet master.
I'm pulling all the strings.

702
00:49:37,076 --> 00:49:40,475
At the challenge, the idol
was centimetres away from me

703
00:49:40,516 --> 00:49:42,115
and I just didn't see it.

704
00:49:42,156 --> 00:49:45,715
And the next minute, Hayley's
picked it up and she's running away.

705
00:49:45,756 --> 00:49:49,795
It was at that point in time I
knew that my goose was cooked.

706
00:49:54,156 --> 00:49:58,035
The Brains tribe is my political
party, and tonight's tribal council

707
00:49:58,076 --> 00:49:59,076
is Election Day.

708
00:49:59,116 --> 00:50:03,115
The poll's definitely against
me, but the only option is to fight.

709
00:50:03,156 --> 00:50:05,795
So I have to convince Joey's majority

710
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:07,955
to vote for someone else tonight.

711
00:50:11,276 --> 00:50:14,355
Alright, guys. Am I
able to have a little say?

712
00:50:14,396 --> 00:50:16,555
- Yeah, yeah. Have it.
- Shoot, mate.

713
00:50:16,596 --> 00:50:18,475
Sorry. I'll let you guys
ponder your thoughts,

714
00:50:18,516 --> 00:50:22,475
because clearly I know
my position on this tribe.

715
00:50:22,516 --> 00:50:25,875
You know, I know I'm
public enemy number one.

716
00:50:25,916 --> 00:50:29,835
So I'm the obvious choice for tonight.

717
00:50:29,876 --> 00:50:33,555
But I also I think getting rid
of me right now is emotional.

718
00:50:33,596 --> 00:50:36,875
So the question is, who goes tonight?

719
00:50:36,916 --> 00:50:42,435
The other people that I think
are at least worth thinking about -

720
00:50:43,396 --> 00:50:46,155
you've got Wai. We know what
she can contribute in challenges.

721
00:50:47,716 --> 00:50:49,435
You've got Rachel.

722
00:50:49,476 --> 00:50:50,755
Is she weaker than Wai?

723
00:50:54,916 --> 00:50:57,275
If it's me, it's not
going to be a surprise.

724
00:50:58,396 --> 00:51:00,595
That's just my commentary.

725
00:51:03,956 --> 00:51:05,315
I hear ya.

726
00:51:05,356 --> 00:51:07,555
- So, that's... that's it.
- Right.

727
00:51:08,156 --> 00:51:10,875
Working with these people
is like trying to milk a donkey.

728
00:51:10,916 --> 00:51:12,995
I'm sure it's theoretically possible,

729
00:51:13,036 --> 00:51:14,795
but you're going to get a sour outcome.

730
00:51:14,836 --> 00:51:16,955
And that's what it feels
like for me on this tribe.

731
00:51:16,996 --> 00:51:19,555
I'm milking, I'm milking,
I'm milking away.

732
00:51:19,596 --> 00:51:22,075
But nothing good is coming out of it.

733
00:51:22,116 --> 00:51:23,635
Oh, my God.

734
00:51:23,676 --> 00:51:27,555
My only hope is for Hayley
to play her idol for me.

735
00:51:27,596 --> 00:51:29,395
Otherwise, it's game over.

736
00:51:37,036 --> 00:51:40,155
So George just gave
us his final, you know.

737
00:51:40,196 --> 00:51:42,835
- His sales piece.
- Oh, cool. I want to know what it is.

738
00:51:42,876 --> 00:51:44,595
Oh, well, it's... He, he...

739
00:51:44,636 --> 00:51:45,835
He should be in politics.

740
00:51:47,316 --> 00:51:49,955
We're not taking
another risk with Georgie.

741
00:51:49,996 --> 00:51:51,795
100% he's the primary.

742
00:51:53,356 --> 00:51:54,356
OK.

743
00:51:56,396 --> 00:51:57,955
Like, it is what it is.

744
00:52:10,676 --> 00:52:15,275
There's a clear hierarchy
in this tribe making all the calls

745
00:52:15,316 --> 00:52:18,435
and the rest of us are
just following along.

746
00:52:20,076 --> 00:52:24,675
George is a big target, but
I've got some other ideas.

747
00:52:26,716 --> 00:52:29,915
Finding the idol, it does bring
me power and it makes me feel

748
00:52:29,956 --> 00:52:32,995
like I can make big moves.

749
00:52:33,036 --> 00:52:35,195
So tonight presents an opportunity.

750
00:52:35,236 --> 00:52:38,595
We could get rid of one of
the biggest threats in the game,

751
00:52:38,636 --> 00:52:42,275
and no one will suspect that
I would orchestrate this vote.

752
00:52:42,316 --> 00:52:46,755
It's about time to gather up all
the people at the bottom of this tribe

753
00:52:46,796 --> 00:52:49,075
to take the head off the snake.

754
00:52:49,116 --> 00:52:52,395
I'm going to take control of
the game and I'm going to do it

755
00:52:52,436 --> 00:52:54,195
without using my idol tonight.

756
00:53:03,636 --> 00:53:04,636
Yep.

757
00:53:05,036 --> 00:53:06,595
How are you feeling going forward?

758
00:53:06,636 --> 00:53:08,235
Feeling like...

759
00:53:08,276 --> 00:53:13,395
It's obviously going to
go, George, and then Wai.

760
00:53:13,436 --> 00:53:15,515
Yep. I hear you.

761
00:53:16,636 --> 00:53:18,235
Who have they said for you to vote for?

762
00:53:19,436 --> 00:53:20,795
George.

763
00:53:20,836 --> 00:53:23,395
Orders come down the
line and I'm not enjoying that.

764
00:53:25,836 --> 00:53:31,955
Did you have any interest
in, in... in something tonight?

765
00:53:31,996 --> 00:53:34,115
These guys?

766
00:53:35,916 --> 00:53:37,035
Who would you pick?

767
00:53:57,007 --> 00:54:02,100
Would you have any interest
in, in... in something tonight?

768
00:54:03,147 --> 00:54:05,540
These guys?

769
00:54:09,934 --> 00:54:11,293
Who would you pick?

770
00:54:21,054 --> 00:54:22,853
That's a pretty big move.

771
00:54:23,614 --> 00:54:24,653
But I like your thinking.

772
00:54:24,694 --> 00:54:28,813
Do you know what? I actually
wouldn't have been surprised...

773
00:54:28,854 --> 00:54:30,373
I'm all about stirring stuff up.

774
00:54:30,414 --> 00:54:32,573
Oh, I know that. I know that.

775
00:54:34,093 --> 00:54:35,093
But, um...

776
00:54:35,094 --> 00:54:36,773
I need some carnage
to keep me interested.

777
00:54:36,814 --> 00:54:37,814
Yeah.

778
00:54:38,494 --> 00:54:39,613
I'm in.

779
00:54:42,574 --> 00:54:44,973
Right now, Joey is at
the top of the alliance.

780
00:54:45,014 --> 00:54:49,093
He is like the puppet master
who's running this camp.

781
00:54:49,134 --> 00:54:51,773
So I've decided we
could get Joey out tonight.

782
00:54:53,054 --> 00:54:56,893
It would mean that I knock out a
huge social threat down the line

783
00:54:56,934 --> 00:54:58,613
that's gonna be dangerous for my game.

784
00:54:58,654 --> 00:55:02,973
So all I need is four other
votes to take him down.

785
00:55:03,014 --> 00:55:04,413
I've got Baden.

786
00:55:04,454 --> 00:55:08,333
Now I need Rachel, Wai and
George to make this happen.

787
00:55:08,374 --> 00:55:12,213
But I know no one wants
to work with George,

788
00:55:12,254 --> 00:55:15,533
so I have a huge task on my hands.

789
00:55:28,894 --> 00:55:32,173
Well, then that's when
things start getting serious.

790
00:55:32,214 --> 00:55:33,573
- Yeah.
- What were you thinking?

791
00:55:44,854 --> 00:55:46,373
I think it's too risky.

792
00:55:55,334 --> 00:55:56,573
There is a lot at stake

793
00:55:56,614 --> 00:55:59,613
and I am very stressed
that this plan won't come off.

794
00:56:03,934 --> 00:56:06,773
Wai is going to be a
difficult one to convince.

795
00:56:06,814 --> 00:56:09,733
She voted with Joey
at the last tribal council

796
00:56:09,774 --> 00:56:13,733
and now I need to know that
she's willing to work with George.

797
00:56:13,774 --> 00:56:16,213
It's her name as the split vote tonight.

798
00:56:17,694 --> 00:56:21,213
So she needs to come to
her senses and make a move.

799
00:56:22,333 --> 00:56:23,333
Yeah.

800
00:56:23,334 --> 00:56:25,933
So there's an option we could
do something different tonight.

801
00:56:25,973 --> 00:56:26,973
OK.

802
00:56:26,974 --> 00:56:31,773
But please don't tell everyone
else and then kill my game.

803
00:56:42,974 --> 00:56:47,093
And I don't want you to
go, but what we could do...

804
00:56:53,614 --> 00:56:54,614
Yeah, I know.

805
00:56:55,374 --> 00:56:57,653
Could do it. Could do it.

806
00:56:58,054 --> 00:57:01,533
Is that your gut? That's what you feel.

807
00:57:01,574 --> 00:57:05,413
Because if we burn bridges
now, it could come back to bite us.

808
00:57:06,734 --> 00:57:08,533
You know, that's the hardest
part about this decision.

809
00:57:18,534 --> 00:57:19,534
We are.

810
00:57:23,534 --> 00:57:26,333
Hayley's put Joey's name out there

811
00:57:26,374 --> 00:57:28,533
and I can see the pros and cons.

812
00:57:28,574 --> 00:57:31,653
The advantage of voting up
Joey is Joey is definitely a threat.

813
00:57:31,694 --> 00:57:35,013
So it's important to take him out
now while we still have numbers.

814
00:57:35,774 --> 00:57:39,493
But on the other hand, what I don't
want to do is reverse my situation

815
00:57:39,534 --> 00:57:44,333
and end up back in a place where
I am stuck with George's volatility.

816
00:57:44,374 --> 00:57:46,733
I'm part of the majority alliance now

817
00:57:46,774 --> 00:57:49,093
and I know how
dangerous a position I'm in.

818
00:57:49,134 --> 00:57:51,053
And to kind of turn my back on them,

819
00:57:51,094 --> 00:57:53,133
I don't want to jeopardise
my position further.

820
00:57:54,854 --> 00:57:58,733
I think if I save George, I'm
putting myself at risk here.

821
00:57:58,774 --> 00:58:03,053
I empathise with both sides
and I just need time to process it.

822
00:58:13,134 --> 00:58:16,133
What are you going to do again,
Wai? Are you gonna vote for me again?

823
00:58:16,174 --> 00:58:19,853
- I don't know.
- I mean, we have to vote.

824
00:58:19,894 --> 00:58:22,733
Have you reflected on what
happened two nights ago?

825
00:58:22,774 --> 00:58:24,893
I reflected well.

826
00:58:24,934 --> 00:58:27,813
I guess, like I said,
ownership and I own it.

827
00:58:27,854 --> 00:58:29,453
I trusted you 100%.

828
00:58:29,494 --> 00:58:33,413
People are very surprising and
people can be disappointments.

829
00:58:33,454 --> 00:58:35,853
And that's part of
what we learn about life.

830
00:58:35,894 --> 00:58:39,093
Yeah, I know. And no one is more
disappointed in me, Wai. Trust me.

831
00:58:39,134 --> 00:58:40,733
I know.

832
00:58:40,774 --> 00:58:43,813
I can think about it when
I'm packing my bags tonight.

833
00:58:45,414 --> 00:58:48,333
I don't see a light at
the end of this tunnel.

834
00:58:48,374 --> 00:58:51,093
I know my pitch has failed with Joey.

835
00:58:51,134 --> 00:58:54,333
I know I'm going home
at tonight's tribal council.

836
00:58:54,374 --> 00:58:56,373
My last day here.

837
00:58:57,534 --> 00:59:00,493
If there is a Macedonian
Jesus out there,

838
00:59:00,534 --> 00:59:02,853
I need my bacon saved tonight.

839
00:59:08,294 --> 00:59:11,173
I've put in a lot of
legwork today already.

840
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:14,933
Everyone else is on board to
vote out Joey, but George is pivotal

841
00:59:14,974 --> 00:59:16,053
for this plan.

842
00:59:17,214 --> 00:59:20,533
Because right now I
need George as a number.

843
00:59:20,574 --> 00:59:23,813
I haven't even been
able to talk to him at all.

844
00:59:23,854 --> 00:59:25,893
I'm sure I could somehow
talk to him at tribal.

845
00:59:26,454 --> 00:59:30,933
But if Joey doesn't go tonight, that
could be really dangerous for me.

846
00:59:30,974 --> 00:59:33,333
Every vote is so important.

847
00:59:40,534 --> 00:59:44,053
I'm feeling very comfortable, I feel
like tonight we have the numbers,

848
00:59:44,094 --> 00:59:46,693
so I don't want any mistakes tonight.

849
00:59:46,734 --> 00:59:48,533
Georgie has to go.

850
00:59:48,574 --> 00:59:51,253
Everyone's falling into line
and I'm calling the shots.

851
00:59:51,294 --> 00:59:54,333
So King George's head will roll.

852
00:59:54,374 --> 00:59:56,533
This should be an easy one tonight.

853
00:59:56,574 --> 00:59:58,653
It's a no-brainer.

854
01:00:44,017 --> 01:00:46,976
So, Hayley, last time
you guys were here,

855
01:00:47,017 --> 01:00:49,376
you chose to go ahead
and get rid of Cara.

856
01:00:49,417 --> 01:00:51,096
Why was that?

857
01:00:51,137 --> 01:00:54,616
We made that choice because
there was a lot of tension

858
01:00:54,657 --> 01:00:58,736
around the camp and some of that
was tied up between relationships

859
01:00:58,777 --> 01:01:00,856
Cara had with people
who are still here now.

860
01:01:00,897 --> 01:01:05,896
And we collectively thought that
it would be better if we let Cara go

861
01:01:05,937 --> 01:01:07,816
so that we could clear
some of that tension.

862
01:01:09,057 --> 01:01:10,936
So, Rachel, did that work?

863
01:01:10,977 --> 01:01:12,896
It definitely worked.

864
01:01:12,937 --> 01:01:15,376
Yesterday, winning,
winning the reward challenge.

865
01:01:15,417 --> 01:01:19,736
I don't think I've had a
better day actually at camp.

866
01:01:20,697 --> 01:01:23,056
We had fun. It felt lighter.

867
01:01:24,857 --> 01:01:27,696
So Georgia, with such
a happy, united tribe,

868
01:01:27,737 --> 01:01:31,096
is it going to be difficult to
vote someone out tonight?

869
01:01:31,137 --> 01:01:34,776
I mean, it's always difficult
to vote someone out.

870
01:01:34,817 --> 01:01:37,256
But, you know, we need
to do what's necessary

871
01:01:37,297 --> 01:01:39,096
to continue moving forward.

872
01:01:43,057 --> 01:01:47,616
Baden. In the dynamic of your
tribe, where do you think you sit?

873
01:01:47,657 --> 01:01:50,896
I'm not overly concerned at the moment.

874
01:01:50,937 --> 01:01:55,016
And by the time it's my numbers
up, according to these guys,

875
01:01:55,057 --> 01:01:58,456
I plan to have something in
place to turn the tables on them.

876
01:02:03,297 --> 01:02:05,576
At the end of the day, you
align yourself with people

877
01:02:05,617 --> 01:02:07,136
to advance your position.

878
01:02:09,057 --> 01:02:13,376
I just so happen to have an alliance
that I've got people that I trust

879
01:02:13,417 --> 01:02:14,976
and they can trust in me.

880
01:02:16,737 --> 01:02:18,176
One team, one dream.

881
01:02:19,457 --> 01:02:22,136
So, Hayley, where do you think
you sit in that pecking order?

882
01:02:24,057 --> 01:02:28,656
Um, it is hard to say. I think
everybody's hierarchy is different.

883
01:02:29,857 --> 01:02:31,816
And that's what makes
this game so complicated.

884
01:02:32,937 --> 01:02:35,176
My priority is to make sure

885
01:02:35,217 --> 01:02:37,216
that I have built really
good relationships.

886
01:02:37,257 --> 01:02:41,496
So when Survivor starts to crumble,
that something is there to be held.

887
01:02:43,657 --> 01:02:48,176
So, Laura, do you agree that
there is an order of who goes next?

888
01:02:48,217 --> 01:02:51,376
Within the alliance
and network that we built

889
01:02:51,417 --> 01:02:54,416
I don't have an order at all.

890
01:02:54,457 --> 01:02:56,896
And like zero.

891
01:02:56,937 --> 01:02:59,336
So you're saying that everyone
in the alliance, in the alliance

892
01:02:59,377 --> 01:03:01,336
- is on equal footing?
- Yeah.

893
01:03:03,417 --> 01:03:06,256
But Wai, isn't that exactly
what people at the top want,

894
01:03:06,297 --> 01:03:07,856
the people at the bottom to believe?

895
01:03:09,417 --> 01:03:11,176
I think the intention is there.

896
01:03:11,217 --> 01:03:15,056
As long as we can stay unified
and stay together, then we don't

897
01:03:15,097 --> 01:03:17,576
have to start thinking
in that kind of way.

898
01:03:17,617 --> 01:03:19,136
And that might keep us OK.

899
01:03:20,537 --> 01:03:23,496
So would you say there's an
alliance controlling tonight's vote?

900
01:03:24,657 --> 01:03:29,376
Yes, I think there is a plan and
that should be how things work out.

901
01:03:33,697 --> 01:03:37,576
Andrew. Sometimes when you
come to tribal, it's just an easy vote.

902
01:03:37,617 --> 01:03:39,576
Is it gonna be an easy one tonight?

903
01:03:39,617 --> 01:03:43,856
I just think there's just so many
unknowns and you just don't know

904
01:03:43,897 --> 01:03:45,816
who's going to pull a
rabbit out of the hat.

905
01:03:46,857 --> 01:03:49,456
Sometimes the, you know, the
hunter can become the hunted.

906
01:03:51,417 --> 01:03:53,776
I guess we're going to
find out tonight, right?

907
01:03:56,377 --> 01:03:59,336
So, Hayley, how do you think
the tribe is going to change

908
01:03:59,377 --> 01:04:01,976
in its dynamics after tonight's vote?

909
01:04:04,057 --> 01:04:09,176
Um, I think that we will
come together more strongly

910
01:04:09,217 --> 01:04:10,456
after this, I think.

911
01:04:14,017 --> 01:04:15,856
George, is it a concern to hear

912
01:04:15,897 --> 01:04:18,056
that the tribe is going to
be more unified after tonight

913
01:04:18,097 --> 01:04:20,136
when you've been an
outsider for so long?

914
01:04:20,177 --> 01:04:21,296
I don't think so.

915
01:04:21,337 --> 01:04:24,656
I mean, being from Bankstown,
I've been an outsider my whole life.

916
01:04:25,937 --> 01:04:28,056
We don't get a fair
share of our resources

917
01:04:28,097 --> 01:04:29,736
and you have to fight for things.

918
01:04:29,777 --> 01:04:31,336
And that's what I am, a fighter.

919
01:04:31,377 --> 01:04:34,896
So if I have to fight for
unity, that's what I'll fight for.

920
01:04:34,937 --> 01:04:37,416
I could be part of a unified team.

921
01:04:37,457 --> 01:04:40,896
I think I showed that
yesterday. I'm the total package.

922
01:04:40,937 --> 01:04:43,376
I'm strong at the puzzles.

923
01:04:43,417 --> 01:04:45,416
I'm athletic.

924
01:04:45,457 --> 01:04:51,496
I have extreme mental endurance
and physically I'm in good shape.

925
01:04:51,537 --> 01:04:57,096
So I bring an asset to this tribe
and you need assets to move forward.

926
01:04:58,697 --> 01:05:01,736
Laura, you have a look on your
face that says you don't agree.

927
01:05:04,457 --> 01:05:07,136
George, I don't completely
agree with you there.

928
01:05:07,177 --> 01:05:10,456
You showed great resilience
yesterday in that challenge.

929
01:05:10,497 --> 01:05:11,976
Absolutely.

930
01:05:12,017 --> 01:05:17,016
But what George contributed
to our society as a tribe

931
01:05:17,057 --> 01:05:19,136
has been lacking compared to others.

932
01:05:20,217 --> 01:05:23,816
So, George, this side of the
tribe is pointing at you saying

933
01:05:23,857 --> 01:05:26,216
that you're part of the problem

934
01:05:26,257 --> 01:05:28,016
when it comes to the
unification of this tribe.

935
01:05:28,057 --> 01:05:30,336
There's no utility in
looking in the past.

936
01:05:30,377 --> 01:05:32,656
I like to look forward to the future.

937
01:05:32,697 --> 01:05:34,416
And the future is going to be bleak

938
01:05:34,457 --> 01:05:36,616
if we just keep getting
picked off one by one.

939
01:05:39,057 --> 01:05:41,176
At the end of the day, the
past is the best predictor

940
01:05:41,217 --> 01:05:42,376
of future behaviour.

941
01:05:43,537 --> 01:05:46,216
I mean, that's basic human psychology.

942
01:05:48,577 --> 01:05:52,176
So I've got a good feeling
where my vote will go.

943
01:05:52,217 --> 01:05:56,656
But as we've seen before, things
can change around here very quickly.

944
01:05:58,057 --> 01:06:01,416
So, Hayley, Georgia makes a good point.

945
01:06:01,457 --> 01:06:02,776
It's not over until it's over.

946
01:06:03,896 --> 01:06:04,896
Yeah.

947
01:06:04,897 --> 01:06:07,176
Is there still time to make
something happen tonight?

948
01:06:09,657 --> 01:06:12,576
I think we've all had
conversations already

949
01:06:12,617 --> 01:06:14,336
about what we want to happen.

950
01:06:14,377 --> 01:06:18,816
I have no intention of changing my
conversations that I've had before.

951
01:06:18,857 --> 01:06:20,016
So.

952
01:06:21,857 --> 01:06:24,136
It's yeah, it's ready to go.

953
01:06:27,777 --> 01:06:30,016
So, George, after
hearing all this discussion,

954
01:06:30,057 --> 01:06:32,416
do you think your poll
numbers have gone up or down?

955
01:06:32,457 --> 01:06:35,176
Jonathan, I've been praying
to the Survivor gods all day.

956
01:06:35,217 --> 01:06:38,336
I'm hoping for a very good outcome.

957
01:06:38,377 --> 01:06:42,016
But as a good politician knows,

958
01:06:42,057 --> 01:06:44,016
the polling numbers
don't look good for me.

959
01:06:44,057 --> 01:06:45,256
I know that.

960
01:06:45,297 --> 01:06:48,096
But the polls are sometimes wrong

961
01:06:48,137 --> 01:06:49,816
and I'm hoping they're wrong tonight.

962
01:06:50,937 --> 01:06:53,296
But you either have the
numbers or you don't.

963
01:06:53,337 --> 01:06:57,576
And I don't think I have
the numbers on this tribe.

964
01:06:57,617 --> 01:07:00,976
Alright, well, I think it's time
to find out where those polls sit.

965
01:07:04,617 --> 01:07:05,936
It is time to vote.

966
01:07:24,022 --> 01:07:26,421
Alright, well, I think
it's time to vote.

967
01:07:26,462 --> 01:07:27,861
Georgia, you're up.

968
01:08:01,102 --> 01:08:04,181
Joey, leader of the cool kids.

969
01:08:04,222 --> 01:08:07,781
I watched you build your alliance
up. Now watch me break it down.

970
01:08:14,942 --> 01:08:17,741
Georgie, this is the only time
you're ever going to get my vote.

971
01:08:17,782 --> 01:08:21,181
I don't trust you and I can't
march forward into this game

972
01:08:21,222 --> 01:08:22,261
with you still in.

973
01:08:30,822 --> 01:08:35,381
Joey, I'm praying to the Macedonian
Jesus and the Survivor gods

974
01:08:35,422 --> 01:08:37,381
that you run out of snake oil tonight.

975
01:09:10,662 --> 01:09:12,261
I will count the votes.

976
01:09:29,782 --> 01:09:32,341
If anyone has an immunity
idol and you want to play it,

977
01:09:32,382 --> 01:09:33,941
now would be the time to do so.

978
01:09:41,942 --> 01:09:43,621
OK, I'll read the votes.

979
01:09:50,262 --> 01:09:52,781
First vote, Wai.

980
01:09:58,222 --> 01:09:59,222
George.

981
01:10:00,862 --> 01:10:03,021
It's one vote Wai, one vote, George.

982
01:10:09,262 --> 01:10:12,221
George. That's two votes,
George, one vote, Wai.

983
01:10:16,142 --> 01:10:17,381
George.

984
01:10:18,942 --> 01:10:21,021
Three votes, George. One vote, Wai.

985
01:10:24,422 --> 01:10:25,501
Joey.

986
01:10:26,902 --> 01:10:30,061
One vote, Wai. Three votes,
George. One vote, Joey.

987
01:10:36,062 --> 01:10:37,062
Joey.

988
01:10:39,262 --> 01:10:42,341
That's three votes, George.
Two votes, Joey. One vote, Wai.

989
01:10:49,302 --> 01:10:50,302
Joey.

990
01:10:51,502 --> 01:10:52,701
We're tied.

991
01:10:52,742 --> 01:10:55,461
Three votes, Joey. Three
votes, George. One vote, Wai.

992
01:11:04,062 --> 01:11:05,062
Joey.

993
01:11:07,902 --> 01:11:10,061
That's four votes, Joey,
three votes, George.

994
01:11:10,102 --> 01:11:12,941
One vote Wai, one vote left.

995
01:11:17,942 --> 01:11:22,141
The sixth person voted out of
Australian Survivor: Brains Vs Brawn,

996
01:11:22,182 --> 01:11:23,182
Joey.

997
01:11:31,022 --> 01:11:32,461
Need to bring me your torch.

998
01:11:35,902 --> 01:11:37,421
- Oh, my God.
- See yas.

999
01:11:41,902 --> 01:11:43,061
See ya.

1000
01:11:55,262 --> 01:11:58,101
Joey, the tribe has spoken.

1001
01:11:58,142 --> 01:12:00,781
- It was a fun ride.
- It sure was.

1002
01:12:00,822 --> 01:12:02,421
- Cheers, mate.
- Time for you to go.

1003
01:12:18,822 --> 01:12:21,341
Well, if there's one thing
we've learned tonight,

1004
01:12:21,382 --> 01:12:23,461
it's don't ever trust the polls.

1005
01:12:25,662 --> 01:12:27,861
Grab your torches,
head on out. Good night.

1006
01:12:27,902 --> 01:12:29,861
Oh, you kill me.

1007
01:12:49,382 --> 01:12:53,021
Tomorrow night on Australian Survivor -

1008
01:12:53,062 --> 01:12:56,501
the tides have finally
turned at the Brains tribe,

1009
01:12:56,542 --> 01:12:59,341
I'm feeling absolutely ecstatic.

1010
01:12:59,382 --> 01:13:02,021
But in the game of Survivor,

1011
01:13:02,062 --> 01:13:04,301
you never know what's round the corner.

1012
01:13:04,342 --> 01:13:07,261
It is time to drop your buffs.

1013
01:13:08,982 --> 01:13:12,781
My position in the game is back
in the hands of the Survivor gods,

1014
01:13:12,822 --> 01:13:14,461
I could be on the bottom again.

1015
01:13:19,582 --> 01:13:22,341
I wanted to be the
blindside king, but in the end,

1016
01:13:22,382 --> 01:13:25,301
I got hit with the biggest
blindside this season's seen.

1017
01:13:25,342 --> 01:13:26,741
I didn't see it coming.

1018
01:13:26,782 --> 01:13:28,981
I definitely got outwitted today.

1019
01:13:29,022 --> 01:13:33,181
It was a bit of a boss move
and I'm just... I am left in shock.

1020
01:13:33,222 --> 01:13:35,741
I don't really know the mechanics
of what happened tonight.

1021
01:13:35,782 --> 01:13:38,141
I've got to go process that.

1022
01:13:38,182 --> 01:13:41,181
I still can't see George lasting
too much longer in this game,

1023
01:13:41,222 --> 01:13:45,101
but I feel like there is potentially
a bit of a power shift underway.
