1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:18,000
.::FLiCKSiCK 1080p::.

2
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,528
This is the fire brigade.
Is anybody here?

3
00:01:17,665 --> 00:01:19,658
Please wait outside.

4
00:01:20,376 --> 00:01:22,416
What's the date of the last letter?

5
00:01:22,712 --> 00:01:24,539
The 9th, as far as I can see.

6
00:01:53,075 --> 00:01:54,699
The door is open!

7
00:01:57,412 --> 00:01:59,786
...no as far as I know.
During the whole time, they had a nurse,

8
00:01:59,787 --> 00:02:02,158
but it's been a while since I last
saw her. My wife has been...

9
00:02:08,841 --> 00:02:11,166
- Did you open the window?
- No.

10
00:02:20,685 --> 00:02:24,600
LOVE

11
00:03:10,484 --> 00:03:13,569
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to
the Théâtre des Champs Elysées.

12
00:03:13,696 --> 00:03:16,946
We ask you to turn off
your mobile phones.

13
00:03:17,074 --> 00:03:21,238
and remind you that all forms of video
and audio recordings are prohibited.

14
00:03:21,496 --> 00:03:23,903
We hope you enjoy the concert.

15
00:05:20,029 --> 00:05:25,024
They used a screwdriver or something
similar. Doesn't look very professional.

16
00:05:25,159 --> 00:05:27,781
- But who would do something like that?
- No idea.

17
00:05:27,954 --> 00:05:31,618
Why someone would try to break in?
Because he wants to steal something.

18
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,657
- From us?
- Why not?

19
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:38,087
If I come to think about it
three or four people we know

20
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:39,458
have already been burgled.

21
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:41,547
What time is it?
Can't we call the caretaker?

22
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:43,359
I'll do that tomorrow morning.

23
00:05:43,608 --> 00:05:46,215
Don't let this put a damper
on your good mood.

24
00:05:48,766 --> 00:05:52,384
- Or call the police?
- Come, give me your coat.

25
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:04,527
Imagine if we were lying in bed
and somebody broke in.

26
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:07,147
Why should I imagine such a thing?

27
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:10,404
It's terrible.
I think I would die of fright.

28
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:12,031
I would too.

29
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:16,743
- Shall we have a drink?
- I'm tired.

30
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:20,459
I fancy another drink.

31
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:22,458
Do as you please.

32
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:26,923
Matilda told me
that in her building

33
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:30,007
burglars entered the top floor
through the attic.

34
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,638
They simply knocked
a hole into the wall,

35
00:06:32,742 --> 00:06:35,669
cut the most valuable paintings
out of their frames

36
00:06:36,087 --> 00:06:38,699
and disappeared
without leaving a trace.

37
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,099
That's how professionals do it.

38
00:06:47,072 --> 00:06:50,276
Did I tell you that I thought
you looked very pretty tonight.

39
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:51,903
What's gotten into you?

40
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:04,631
The semiquavers in the presto
were incredible. What subtlety!

41
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:07,216
Don't you think?

42
00:07:08,051 --> 00:07:09,676
You're proud of him, huh?

43
00:07:35,245 --> 00:07:36,443
What's the matter.

44
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:41,041
Nothing.

45
00:07:44,921 --> 00:07:46,581
Next week?

46
00:07:47,466 --> 00:07:48,628
No. Yes.

47
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:52,088
No, but it would be better to fix this
as soon as possible.

48
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:56,177
It might give people silly ideas.

49
00:07:56,557 --> 00:07:58,764
And anyway, it's ugly to look at.

50
00:08:00,186 --> 00:08:01,431
At what time?

51
00:08:03,022 --> 00:08:05,560
Yes, okay.
All right.

52
00:08:06,568 --> 00:08:08,810
Will you also bring
the varnish with you?

53
00:08:11,656 --> 00:08:14,112
But at least some primer.

54
00:08:14,451 --> 00:08:16,989
Yes, okay.
Excellent.

55
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:19,159
Yes.

56
00:08:19,997 --> 00:08:22,784
Well, thank you.
Goodbye. Thank you.

57
00:08:25,044 --> 00:08:27,713
- He's reliable.
- I hope so.

58
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:31,713
The last time he kept us
waiting for ages, if you remember.

59
00:08:31,843 --> 00:08:33,420
Yes, that's true.
Thank you.

60
00:08:35,805 --> 00:08:39,803
But if I call a regular company, they
let us wait for at least two months.

61
00:08:40,226 --> 00:08:41,305
Oh yeah?

62
00:08:51,195 --> 00:08:55,323
The Frodons had to wait for three days
when their toilet was clogged.

63
00:08:55,866 --> 00:08:57,693
Not exactly pleasant.

64
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,823
The salt cellar is empty.

65
00:09:17,429 --> 00:09:21,094
I don't know if he's going
to bring us the CD today.

66
00:09:21,642 --> 00:09:23,718
Maybe he won't come at all.

67
00:09:25,312 --> 00:09:29,227
We could go to Virgin
this afternoon and buy it.

68
00:09:30,192 --> 00:09:31,355
What do you say?

69
00:09:36,239 --> 00:09:37,614
What's going on?

70
00:09:40,201 --> 00:09:42,194
What's the matter?
Anne?

71
00:09:44,205 --> 00:09:45,285
Cuckoo.

72
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:47,823
I'm here

73
00:09:49,836 --> 00:09:50,452
Anne.

74
00:09:52,214 --> 00:09:53,708
What's going on?

75
00:09:58,052 --> 00:10:00,804
Anne, what's going on?

76
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:07,509
What's the matter?

77
00:10:49,186 --> 00:10:50,384
Anne...

78
00:10:57,152 --> 00:10:59,062
Anne, darling, please.

79
00:10:59,196 --> 00:11:02,861
Anne, look at me.
What's the matter?

80
00:11:05,661 --> 00:11:07,036
What's the matter?

81
00:11:59,547 --> 00:12:00,542
Anne?

82
00:12:25,823 --> 00:12:26,902
What are you doing?

83
00:12:27,491 --> 00:12:29,400
You left the water running.

84
00:12:30,536 --> 00:12:32,825
Hey, what's wrong with you?
Are you completely crazy?

85
00:12:34,415 --> 00:12:36,906
- Is this a joke?
- What?

86
00:12:37,042 --> 00:12:40,874
Is this a joke?
Is this supposed to be a joke?

87
00:12:41,005 --> 00:12:43,496
What joke?
I don't get it.

88
00:12:44,425 --> 00:12:47,046
Why do you talk to me in that tone?
What has gotten into you?

89
00:12:48,178 --> 00:12:50,716
Please, Anne, stop this game,
it's not funny.

90
00:12:50,847 --> 00:12:53,682
What game, for Christ's sake?
What's the matter?

91
00:13:02,276 --> 00:13:04,019
Why did you not react?

92
00:13:04,153 --> 00:13:06,691
- To what?
- To what? Uh, to everything, to me.

93
00:13:06,822 --> 00:13:09,111
- When?
- Just now. A moment ago.

94
00:13:10,617 --> 00:13:13,108
Please, tell me, what's wrong.

95
00:13:14,495 --> 00:13:16,120
I don't know what to say.

96
00:13:16,289 --> 00:13:19,990
You really don't remember
what just happened?

97
00:13:20,627 --> 00:13:22,584
But what did happen?

98
00:13:25,924 --> 00:13:29,625
You were sitting there,
staring into space

99
00:13:29,761 --> 00:13:32,881
and you didn't answer
when I asked you what the matter was.

100
00:13:35,434 --> 00:13:39,513
I took this towel and put it
on your face but you didn't react.

101
00:13:39,687 --> 00:13:42,973
Look, there's still dampness
on your collar.

102
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:51,069
And when... when was it?

103
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:53,868
Just now, a couple of minutes ago.

104
00:13:54,786 --> 00:13:57,538
- So?
- So? There's no "so".

105
00:13:57,664 --> 00:14:01,957
I went into the bedroom to get dressed.
I wanted to get help.

106
00:14:02,084 --> 00:14:03,495
- Help?
- Yes.

107
00:14:03,877 --> 00:14:05,870
But then you turned off the tap.

108
00:14:06,463 --> 00:14:09,001
Yes, because you left it on.

109
00:14:13,888 --> 00:14:15,216
I don't understand.

110
00:14:16,641 --> 00:14:17,554
Me neither.

111
00:14:20,353 --> 00:14:22,061
I should call Dr. Bertier.

112
00:14:22,188 --> 00:14:25,188
- Why? What can he do?
- I don't know. Examine you.

113
00:14:25,315 --> 00:14:27,224
I am fine, I am fine.

114
00:14:29,027 --> 00:14:30,652
Please, Anne.

115
00:14:31,029 --> 00:14:34,529
It's absurd, we cannot go on
as if nothing had happened.

116
00:14:34,658 --> 00:14:37,066
But what did happen?

117
00:14:37,661 --> 00:14:40,033
I'm sitting here, having breakfast

118
00:14:40,372 --> 00:14:43,042
and you're telling me things
I don't understand.

119
00:14:44,668 --> 00:14:47,872
Can you explain to me
how the tea towel got here?

120
00:14:48,005 --> 00:14:48,917
No.

121
00:14:49,339 --> 00:14:52,008
- Who turned the tap on?
- You did.

122
00:14:53,635 --> 00:14:56,340
- Oh, you remember that?
- No.

123
00:14:57,973 --> 00:14:59,799
Do you want to torture me?

124
00:15:00,225 --> 00:15:01,885
Leave me in peace.

125
00:15:04,604 --> 00:15:07,060
Don't you think
I'd better call Dr. Bertier?

126
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:08,186
No!

127
00:15:57,532 --> 00:15:58,450
You know how he is.

128
00:15:58,555 --> 00:16:01,171
Once he's got something into his head,
he has to go through with it.

129
00:16:01,702 --> 00:16:04,193
In the end
everyone was delighted.

130
00:16:04,621 --> 00:16:06,495
Besides, it didn't hurt
our financial situation.

131
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:11,248
So, we're playing until the 28th,
then we have a ten-day break

132
00:16:11,545 --> 00:16:16,124
then we go to Stockholm for four days
and then to Kuhmo in Finland.

133
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,921
I don't know where that is.
At the North Pole.

134
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:22,467
Geoff has already been there a few times,
he loves it.

135
00:16:22,765 --> 00:16:25,338
We're playing the "Dowland
Transcriptions" there.

136
00:16:26,184 --> 00:16:28,509
Then we return to London.

137
00:16:29,854 --> 00:16:31,397
What about the children?

138
00:16:33,275 --> 00:16:39,360
Liz is at her boarding school
and John lives his own life. He's 26.

139
00:16:41,909 --> 00:16:43,403
What does he do?

140
00:16:45,954 --> 00:16:49,158
He works.
He is very independent.

141
00:16:50,167 --> 00:16:51,744
We rarely see him.

142
00:16:54,128 --> 00:16:55,872
A bit like Geoff.

143
00:16:56,839 --> 00:16:58,797
They don't really get along.

144
00:17:00,093 --> 00:17:04,387
Geoff wants to advise him on everything.
John doesn't like that at all.

145
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:08,642
- Is he good?
- Yes, I think so.

146
00:17:10,687 --> 00:17:14,021
He is less impulsive,
but very industrious.

147
00:17:15,191 --> 00:17:16,934
This sounds rather depreciatory.

148
00:17:17,068 --> 00:17:19,356
No. He's just not like Geoff.

149
00:17:19,946 --> 00:17:21,321
He is...

150
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:26,405
calm, but stubborn.
I think he'll do all right.

151
00:17:27,537 --> 00:17:31,451
The other day he played the solo part
of the Haydn concerto

152
00:17:31,582 --> 00:17:34,537
at the conservatoire's last concert.

153
00:17:34,711 --> 00:17:35,956
It was very good.

154
00:17:37,172 --> 00:17:40,421
Geoff was there
and he congratulated him at the end.

155
00:17:42,926 --> 00:17:43,958
And you?

156
00:17:46,138 --> 00:17:47,169
What do you mean?

157
00:17:50,434 --> 00:17:52,059
Did you both make up?

158
00:17:52,686 --> 00:17:55,604
Oh, you know him.

159
00:17:59,068 --> 00:18:02,817
In September, he discovered his love
for a violinist,

160
00:18:02,947 --> 00:18:05,318
who had been in our ensemble
for many years.

161
00:18:06,908 --> 00:18:08,023
What can I tell you?

162
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,326
It was a huge drama.
She tried to commit suicide.

163
00:18:11,455 --> 00:18:15,702
That scared him.
He returned to me, devoured by remorse.

164
00:18:18,629 --> 00:18:21,202
I've got used to it by now, but...

165
00:18:21,507 --> 00:18:24,543
I feel embarrassed because
the whole ensemble knows about it.

166
00:18:27,096 --> 00:18:28,257
Do you love him?

167
00:18:29,764 --> 00:18:31,045
Yes, I think so.

168
00:18:39,482 --> 00:18:41,392
What about the surgery?

169
00:18:45,197 --> 00:18:47,355
What do you want me to explain?

170
00:18:47,532 --> 00:18:49,240
They made a test,

171
00:18:49,368 --> 00:18:53,281
said the carotid artery was blocked
and that surgery would be necessary.

172
00:18:54,622 --> 00:18:56,413
She was scared.

173
00:18:57,041 --> 00:19:00,078
Totally confused, frightened.

174
00:19:01,254 --> 00:19:04,208
You know
she's always been afraid of doctors.

175
00:19:05,592 --> 00:19:10,189
They said the risk was very low
and that if they didn't operate,

176
00:19:10,502 --> 00:19:15,330
she'd be certain
to have another, more serious stroke.

177
00:19:16,102 --> 00:19:18,177
And what do they say now?

178
00:19:18,979 --> 00:19:20,972
That it didn't go well.

179
00:19:24,026 --> 00:19:26,944
It's one of the 5% that go wrong.

180
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,405
It's pretty upsetting.

181
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:43,496
Usually at this time, I take a nap.

182
00:19:45,005 --> 00:19:48,255
My blood sugar
is somewhere down in my socks.

183
00:19:50,677 --> 00:19:53,632
- I'm so sorry.
- Yes.

184
00:19:59,311 --> 00:20:01,981
- What can I do for you?
- Nothing.

185
00:20:02,356 --> 00:20:06,649
It was very nice of you to come
despite all of your stress.

186
00:20:08,445 --> 00:20:11,196
No, honestly,
there's nothing you can do.

187
00:20:11,489 --> 00:20:15,322
We'll see how things go
when she's back here in the apartment.

188
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:18,363
We'll manage all right.

189
00:20:19,581 --> 00:20:22,119
Maybe I'll hire a home health aide,

190
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,747
maybe I'll manage on my own.
We'll see.

191
00:20:28,257 --> 00:20:31,672
We've been through a lot together,
your mother and I.

192
00:20:33,761 --> 00:20:36,299
All this is still a bit new.

193
00:20:39,392 --> 00:20:42,661
It's funny. I don't know if I should
tell you as it might embarrass you

194
00:20:42,849 --> 00:20:44,278
but when I came in earlier

195
00:20:44,424 --> 00:20:47,822
I remembered how I always used to listen
to the two of you making love as a child.

196
00:20:49,903 --> 00:20:51,397
This always reassured me.

197
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:54,235
It gave me a feeling
that you loved each other

198
00:20:54,365 --> 00:20:56,488
and that we'd always be together.

199
00:21:02,164 --> 00:21:04,241
- Watch your fingers!
- Yeah.

200
00:21:41,287 --> 00:21:43,611
Put this next to the window.
Thank you.

201
00:21:43,747 --> 00:21:44,826
Certainly, sir.

202
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:48,114
Sorry.

203
00:21:54,675 --> 00:21:57,000
- This is for both of you.
- Thank you.

204
00:21:57,135 --> 00:21:59,461
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

205
00:22:02,349 --> 00:22:03,594
Thank you, Mr. Méry.

206
00:22:03,726 --> 00:22:06,891
If you need anything,
just call downstairs.

207
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:10,021
- If we can help you in one way or another...
- Right now everything's fine.

208
00:22:10,148 --> 00:22:13,731
I'll let your wife know
as soon as we need anything.

209
00:22:14,277 --> 00:22:16,685
Good to have you back,
Mrs. Laurent.

210
00:22:16,988 --> 00:22:19,360
Yes, thank you, Mr. Méry.
Thank you.

211
00:22:19,783 --> 00:22:22,784
If... If you need anything...

212
00:22:22,953 --> 00:22:24,447
Yes, thank you.

213
00:22:25,038 --> 00:22:29,202
Goodbye then, ma'am.
Welcome home again.

214
00:22:30,168 --> 00:22:33,583
- Goodbye, sir.
- Goodbye, Mr. Méry, thank you.

215
00:22:45,975 --> 00:22:47,635
Where do you want...

216
00:22:48,019 --> 00:22:49,347
In the living room.

217
00:23:27,641 --> 00:23:29,384
Shall I make some tea?

218
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,848
First come sit with me.

219
00:23:53,708 --> 00:23:57,374
- Can you help me into the arm chair?
- Yes, of course.

220
00:23:58,338 --> 00:23:59,797
Come closer.

221
00:24:00,298 --> 00:24:03,299
Put your knees against mine
so I don't slip.

222
00:24:04,428 --> 00:24:07,001
Put your right arm around me.

223
00:24:07,764 --> 00:24:09,721
And lift me up.

224
00:24:10,683 --> 00:24:12,177
And up!

225
00:24:32,913 --> 00:24:33,944
Here.

226
00:25:00,524 --> 00:25:02,849
I'm so glad you're back.

227
00:25:04,528 --> 00:25:05,903
So am I.

228
00:25:15,122 --> 00:25:17,530
- Promise me one thing.
- What?

229
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:22,412
Please never take me back
to the hospital.

230
00:25:24,047 --> 00:25:24,877
What?

231
00:25:26,842 --> 00:25:28,336
You promise?

232
00:25:30,053 --> 00:25:32,295
- Anne...
- You promise?

233
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:36,426
- Anne, I'm...
- Don't talk right now.

234
00:25:37,936 --> 00:25:41,637
Don't give me any lectures.
Please.

235
00:25:44,401 --> 00:25:47,152
- What can I say?
- Nothing.

236
00:25:48,738 --> 00:25:50,149
Just don't say anything.

237
00:25:52,408 --> 00:25:53,488
Okay?

238
00:26:14,597 --> 00:26:15,925
Thank you.

239
00:26:19,477 --> 00:26:21,055
Thank you, dear.

240
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:28,319
- Everything fine?
- Everything is fine.

241
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:33,782
You don't have to hold my hand
all the time.

242
00:26:33,991 --> 00:26:36,564
I can look after myself,
you know.

243
00:26:37,578 --> 00:26:40,330
And don't feel guilty.
That would be pointless.

244
00:26:40,456 --> 00:26:43,291
And a drag for me too.

245
00:26:44,585 --> 00:26:47,254
- I don't feel guilty.
- That's good.

246
00:26:49,924 --> 00:26:51,501
Go over there now.

247
00:26:52,301 --> 00:26:54,093
I'm not a cripple.

248
00:26:55,555 --> 00:26:59,551
You can easily leave me alone
for two minutes. I won't collapse.

249
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,596
Okay.

250
00:27:04,021 --> 00:27:06,772
Did you buy the new book
on Harnoncourt?

251
00:27:07,232 --> 00:27:09,474
- I've already read it.
- And?

252
00:27:09,943 --> 00:27:12,150
Do you want it?
Shall I get it for you?

253
00:27:12,446 --> 00:27:13,774
Please do.

254
00:27:24,207 --> 00:27:26,246
I don't know where I put it.

255
00:27:26,793 --> 00:27:30,043
- Don't worry. It's not that important.
- Yes it is.

256
00:27:30,922 --> 00:27:34,671
I think I left it...

257
00:27:40,182 --> 00:27:41,759
Ah, here it is!

258
00:27:42,809 --> 00:27:45,347
Nothing like an infallible memory!

259
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:53,485
I thought I had left it
in the small bedroom

260
00:27:54,362 --> 00:27:59,403
but I had already put it away.
Tidy people just can't help being tidy.

261
00:28:00,702 --> 00:28:01,900
Thank you.

262
00:28:05,665 --> 00:28:08,666
Good, now do something for yourself.

263
00:28:09,377 --> 00:28:13,754
Don't stay here to see
how I hold the book, okay?

264
00:28:14,006 --> 00:28:14,919
Okay.

265
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:21,546
I'll leave the door open.

266
00:29:29,747 --> 00:29:32,417
Unfortunately the strawberries
were already moldy.

267
00:29:33,126 --> 00:29:36,709
I'll go and get you some fresh ones
tomorrow morning from the market.

268
00:29:40,008 --> 00:29:42,962
My husband will bring you
the Evian water this afternoon.

269
00:29:43,178 --> 00:29:45,550
I'm not supposed to carry anything
heavy. My back, you know.

270
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,009
No problem.

271
00:29:49,809 --> 00:29:54,305
It came to 76.40.
Here's the receipt.

272
00:29:55,898 --> 00:29:59,398
- Your change, 23.60.
- Keep the small change.

273
00:29:59,652 --> 00:30:01,194
Thank you, sir.

274
00:30:03,406 --> 00:30:07,534
Well, I'll be going then.
Call me if you need anything.

275
00:30:07,702 --> 00:30:09,030
I will.

276
00:30:15,542 --> 00:30:19,326
- Is your wife doing well?
- Yes. She's recovering.

277
00:30:19,672 --> 00:30:22,423
That's good.
Give her my regards.

278
00:30:23,092 --> 00:30:25,797
My husband and I are very glad
she's back.

279
00:30:25,928 --> 00:30:27,921
Yes, we are too.

280
00:30:28,472 --> 00:30:30,381
Goodbye, Mrs. Méry, thank you.

281
00:30:30,516 --> 00:30:32,592
- Goodbye, sir.
- Goodbye.

282
00:30:38,523 --> 00:30:42,936
I'll bring you the strawberries
tomorrow around noon, if that suits you.

283
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:44,896
Yes, fine.
Thank you.

284
00:30:55,707 --> 00:30:57,949
- Can you come here, please.
- Yes.

285
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:49,853
Some banal love story about a nobleman
and a lower middle class girl

286
00:32:49,986 --> 00:32:51,133
who can't marry

287
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:54,688
and who then, out of sheer magnanimity,
renounce their love for each other.

288
00:32:56,743 --> 00:32:59,828
In fact, I don't remember the story.

289
00:33:00,622 --> 00:33:05,330
In any case, I remember that I was
completely shaken up when I went out

290
00:33:05,543 --> 00:33:07,999
and that I needed some time
to calm down.

291
00:33:08,129 --> 00:33:09,125
Thank you.

292
00:33:11,925 --> 00:33:14,534
In the courtyard of the house
where grandma lived,

293
00:33:14,871 --> 00:33:18,761
there was a young guy at the window
who asked me where I'd been.

294
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:21,398
He was a few years older than me.

295
00:33:21,893 --> 00:33:26,306
He was a show-off
who of course really impressed me.

296
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:29,182
"To the cinema", I said to him.

297
00:33:29,525 --> 00:33:34,104
Because I was very proud grandma had given
me money to go all alone to the cinema.

298
00:33:35,406 --> 00:33:36,984
"What did you watch?"

299
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:39,738
I started to tell him the story

300
00:33:40,244 --> 00:33:44,491
and as I did,
all the emotion came back.

301
00:33:45,291 --> 00:33:50,368
I didn't want to cry in front of this
guy, but it was impossible.

302
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:56,465
There I was, in tears in the courtyard,
and I told him the drama till the end.

303
00:34:02,474 --> 00:34:05,012
So? How did he react?

304
00:34:06,562 --> 00:34:09,978
No idea.
He probably laughed at me.

305
00:34:10,691 --> 00:34:12,269
I don't remember.

306
00:34:12,735 --> 00:34:18,191
I don't remember the film either.
But I remember the feelings.

307
00:34:19,407 --> 00:34:21,365
I was ashamed to cry.

308
00:34:22,953 --> 00:34:26,951
But telling him the story made
all my feelings and tears come back,

309
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:30,541
maybe even stronger than
when I was actually watching the film.

310
00:34:31,169 --> 00:34:33,043
I just couldn't stop.

311
00:34:33,589 --> 00:34:36,673
That's sweet.
Why have you never told me this?

312
00:34:37,968 --> 00:34:41,134
There are still many stories
I've never told you.

313
00:34:44,307 --> 00:34:48,768
Don't tell me you're going to ruin
your image in your old age?

314
00:34:49,229 --> 00:34:50,889
You bet I won't.

315
00:34:51,898 --> 00:34:53,392
But what is my image?

316
00:34:58,154 --> 00:35:00,064
Sometimes you're a monster.

317
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,280
But you're nice.

318
00:35:05,536 --> 00:35:07,410
Can I get you another drink?

319
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:11,829
Five.

320
00:35:15,171 --> 00:35:16,630
Six.

321
00:35:19,634 --> 00:35:20,914
Seven.

322
00:35:23,388 --> 00:35:24,586
Eight.

323
00:35:27,058 --> 00:35:28,433
Nine.

324
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:32,468
Ten.

325
00:35:33,689 --> 00:35:36,441
Up to fifteen.
Eleven.

326
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:41,101
Twelve.

327
00:35:43,574 --> 00:35:45,033
Thirteen.

328
00:35:46,369 --> 00:35:47,911
Fourteen.

329
00:35:49,664 --> 00:35:50,743
And fifteen.

330
00:35:54,918 --> 00:35:57,124
- You're okay?
- I'm okay.

331
00:36:05,262 --> 00:36:08,180
Listen to this.
My horoscope.

332
00:36:09,433 --> 00:36:12,683
Motto: You have lots of verve,
but need to be more serious!

333
00:36:13,437 --> 00:36:18,098
Love: High-class conversation
is what you need.

334
00:36:18,566 --> 00:36:23,809
Work: You're motivated again.
But proceed with care.

335
00:36:24,322 --> 00:36:30,574
Health: Loosen up by doing exercises.
It'll give you renewed pizzazz.

336
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:35,996
You've got only yourself to blame
if you read this nonsense.

337
00:36:40,339 --> 00:36:43,007
Tomorrow afternoon
is Pierre's funeral.

338
00:36:44,008 --> 00:36:45,716
You've got to go.

339
00:36:46,427 --> 00:36:50,295
I fear I must.
Though I don't want to go at all.

340
00:36:51,015 --> 00:36:53,685
Few people like to go to funerals.

341
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:55,719
Oh, I know a few people who do.

342
00:36:56,604 --> 00:37:00,602
Annette, for instance,
cannot wait to get all dressed up.

343
00:37:01,109 --> 00:37:03,861
- And François, this idiot...
- You're mean.

344
00:37:04,112 --> 00:37:06,816
What would you say
if no one came to your funeral?

345
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:10,567
Nothing, presumably.

346
00:37:15,039 --> 00:37:21,327
Have you talked to Jeanne
since I went to the hospital?

347
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,540
Does she knows I can't come?

348
00:37:24,715 --> 00:37:26,708
Yes.
Of course.

349
00:37:27,135 --> 00:37:28,463
What did she say?

350
00:37:29,762 --> 00:37:32,299
- She was in shock.
- In what way?

351
00:37:32,806 --> 00:37:36,674
I don't know. What are people like
when they're shocked?

352
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:40,394
She was speechless,
she couldn't believe it.

353
00:37:41,231 --> 00:37:44,351
I don't know, well, not precisely.

354
00:37:44,693 --> 00:37:47,267
You know I've spoken
to a lot of people since.

355
00:37:49,657 --> 00:37:50,652
I'm sorry.

356
00:37:52,493 --> 00:37:53,691
No.

357
00:37:54,828 --> 00:37:57,864
Please forgive me.
I didn't mean to be unkind.

358
00:37:58,957 --> 00:38:02,741
But what's the point
of talking about it all the time.

359
00:38:03,295 --> 00:38:05,334
Do I talk about it all the time?

360
00:38:05,756 --> 00:38:06,751
No.

361
00:38:08,675 --> 00:38:09,838
I'm sorry.

362
00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:21,766
What...

363
00:39:06,691 --> 00:39:10,735
Why are you back already?
What time is it?

364
00:39:33,967 --> 00:39:36,636
Forgive me, I was too slow.

365
00:39:37,804 --> 00:39:40,556
- Anne...
- Can you wheel me into the living room?

366
00:39:44,144 --> 00:39:45,058
Yes.

367
00:40:32,066 --> 00:40:35,067
You're always good at surprises.

368
00:40:35,612 --> 00:40:36,607
Yes.

369
00:40:38,615 --> 00:40:40,607
Why did you come home earlier?

370
00:40:40,742 --> 00:40:43,696
I didn't come home earlier.
I took a taxi.

371
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:46,445
On Saturdays
there's not a lot of traffic.

372
00:40:47,122 --> 00:40:48,202
That's true.

373
00:40:51,252 --> 00:40:52,912
How was the funeral?

374
00:40:53,045 --> 00:40:54,374
Anne...

375
00:40:59,010 --> 00:41:01,714
How was it?
Come on, tell me!

376
00:41:29,081 --> 00:41:30,741
It was rather bizarre.

377
00:41:33,544 --> 00:41:35,536
The priest was an idiot.

378
00:41:37,797 --> 00:41:42,590
A former colleague of Pierre's
came to make a speech

379
00:41:42,719 --> 00:41:45,720
that was embarrassingly emotional.

380
00:41:47,265 --> 00:41:52,307
His former secretary
came with a mini cassette player

381
00:41:52,604 --> 00:41:54,929
and put on "Yesterday" by the Beatles.

382
00:41:55,649 --> 00:41:57,108
You can't imagine.

383
00:41:57,985 --> 00:42:00,142
Everybody turned round
to look at her.

384
00:42:00,653 --> 00:42:03,109
Obviously, it was not planned.

385
00:42:03,865 --> 00:42:05,988
Pierre's grandchildren were there.

386
00:42:06,242 --> 00:42:10,703
Of course, they giggled
as soon as the music began.

387
00:42:11,122 --> 00:42:12,285
Then

388
00:42:12,415 --> 00:42:16,495
the urn was put on a huge stretcher

389
00:42:16,795 --> 00:42:20,413
that was obviously
designed for a coffin,

390
00:42:20,924 --> 00:42:22,962
and we went out into the rain.

391
00:42:23,801 --> 00:42:27,300
They placed the urn
on a small electric cart

392
00:42:27,596 --> 00:42:29,969
that crawled along
for what seemed like an eternity

393
00:42:30,224 --> 00:42:32,798
to the small hole
that they had dug.

394
00:42:33,936 --> 00:42:35,976
Many people got the giggles.

395
00:42:37,356 --> 00:42:39,266
It must have been terrible for Jeanne.

396
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:42,650
There's no point in going on living.
That's how it is.

397
00:42:44,948 --> 00:42:47,616
I know it can only get worse.

398
00:42:48,492 --> 00:42:52,905
Why should I inflict this on us,
on you and me?

399
00:42:55,624 --> 00:42:57,451
You're not inflicting anything on me.

400
00:42:58,669 --> 00:43:01,160
You don't have to lie, Georges.

401
00:43:10,056 --> 00:43:12,213
Put yourself in my place.

402
00:43:13,308 --> 00:43:16,973
Didn't you ever think
that it could happen to me too?

403
00:43:17,103 --> 00:43:18,562
Of course, I did.

404
00:43:19,523 --> 00:43:23,105
But imagination and reality
have little in common.

405
00:43:24,069 --> 00:43:27,604
- But things are getting better every day.
- I don't want to carry on.

406
00:43:28,866 --> 00:43:32,484
You're making such sweet efforts
to make everything easier for me.

407
00:43:32,619 --> 00:43:34,114
But I don't want to go on.

408
00:43:34,663 --> 00:43:36,571
For my own sake.
Not yours.

409
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:40,165
I don't believe you.
I know you.

410
00:43:41,044 --> 00:43:43,535
You think you are a burden to me.

411
00:43:44,172 --> 00:43:47,173
But what would you do
in my place?

412
00:43:47,342 --> 00:43:51,126
I don't want to rack my brain
over this.

413
00:43:51,471 --> 00:43:55,172
I'm tired, I want to go to bed.

414
00:45:15,386 --> 00:45:18,056
Hello.
Nice to see you.

415
00:45:18,556 --> 00:45:20,348
I'm sorry to descend upon you like this.

416
00:45:20,475 --> 00:45:22,800
I tried many times to call you
but to no avail.

417
00:45:22,936 --> 00:45:26,601
I'm sorry. I only pick up the phone
when I've stored the caller's number

418
00:45:26,731 --> 00:45:28,226
and I know who's calling.

419
00:45:28,442 --> 00:45:29,852
But come on in.

420
00:45:31,111 --> 00:45:34,195
I was so sorry that I couldn't manage
to come by after the concert.

421
00:45:34,990 --> 00:45:37,480
I was so pleased that you came.

422
00:45:38,117 --> 00:45:39,446
Come with me.

423
00:45:40,119 --> 00:45:42,195
Yesterday my agent called me.

424
00:45:42,371 --> 00:45:44,578
Actually I'm goning to record
an album in June

425
00:45:44,707 --> 00:45:48,123
and I had to pick a location,
a piano.

426
00:45:48,336 --> 00:45:51,871
So I flew into Paris this morning,

427
00:45:52,215 --> 00:45:55,227
and once I was at my hotel, I thought,
I'll just give it a try and drop in.

428
00:45:55,497 --> 00:45:56,457
It's just around the corner.

429
00:45:56,657 --> 00:45:58,151
Very nice.

430
00:45:59,681 --> 00:46:02,515
- This is for your spouse.
- Thank you.

431
00:46:03,058 --> 00:46:06,474
- Isn't she home?
- Yes she is. I'll get her in a minute.

432
00:46:06,604 --> 00:46:09,391
- Have a seat, please.
- I hope I'm not disturbing you.

433
00:46:09,523 --> 00:46:13,106
No, not at all. I'm very happy
to see you. Have a seat.

434
00:46:14,987 --> 00:46:19,199
We were so thrilled by your concert,
my wife and I.

435
00:46:19,867 --> 00:46:22,239
We hoped we'd see you again soon.

436
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:25,656
Can I can get you something?

437
00:46:25,914 --> 00:46:27,823
- A cup of tea?
- No, thank you.

438
00:46:30,002 --> 00:46:33,834
I'll just put the flowers in a vase
and tell her that you are here.

439
00:46:34,089 --> 00:46:35,287
I'll be right back.

440
00:47:35,984 --> 00:47:39,981
Alexandre, I'm delighted.
How lovely to see you!

441
00:47:40,905 --> 00:47:44,274
Mrs. Laurent!
Lovely to see you too.

442
00:47:44,408 --> 00:47:45,867
Don't get up.

443
00:47:46,661 --> 00:47:47,775
Come on, sit down.

444
00:47:48,704 --> 00:47:50,614
And don't look so serious.

445
00:48:05,512 --> 00:48:07,339
I'm really proud of you.

446
00:48:08,849 --> 00:48:11,305
We were both in raptures
after your concert.

447
00:48:11,435 --> 00:48:15,563
Georges wanted to buy your new CD
the very next morning.

448
00:48:15,689 --> 00:48:19,853
Oh my God! I wanted to bring you one
but then I completely forgot about it.

449
00:48:19,985 --> 00:48:22,477
I left in such a hurry.

450
00:48:23,864 --> 00:48:27,482
- I'll get one today and drop it by.
- No, no, don't worry.

451
00:48:27,909 --> 00:48:32,618
We want to contribute to your success,
even it's only 20 euro.

452
00:48:32,914 --> 00:48:36,864
You have already contributed a lot.
I owe you so much, ma'am.

453
00:48:38,587 --> 00:48:41,256
You owe it to your hard work
and your talent.

454
00:48:42,966 --> 00:48:46,549
Do you remember, when you first gave me
the "Bagatelles" to play?

455
00:48:47,471 --> 00:48:48,550
I was 12 years old.

456
00:48:50,307 --> 00:48:54,518
And in my youthful arrogance
I asked you: "But why the 'Bagatelles'?"

457
00:48:54,769 --> 00:48:58,684
Don't you remember? That day, you really
gave me a piece of your mind.

458
00:49:02,110 --> 00:49:03,853
What has happened to you?

459
00:49:06,156 --> 00:49:08,314
My right side is paralyzed, that's all.

460
00:49:08,450 --> 00:49:10,277
This can happen when you get older.

461
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:12,734
And how...

462
00:49:13,121 --> 00:49:15,529
Let's talk about something else,
if you don't mind.

463
00:49:15,873 --> 00:49:16,822
Yes.

464
00:49:17,708 --> 00:49:19,203
Don't be offended.

465
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:23,410
But I want to enjoy the lovely interlude
you've given us with your visit.

466
00:49:25,299 --> 00:49:26,544
Yes, of course.

467
00:49:27,510 --> 00:49:29,088
You haven't told us yet

468
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:32,885
what's been going on
since the Paris concert.

469
00:49:33,433 --> 00:49:36,469
Well, I was in London
most of the time.

470
00:49:37,270 --> 00:49:38,812
I performed two concerts in Copenhagen,

471
00:49:38,938 --> 00:49:42,472
that was Schubert too.
The "Impromptu", the "Musical Moments".

472
00:49:42,942 --> 00:49:45,777
My whole life revolves
around Schubert at the moment.

473
00:49:46,070 --> 00:49:50,732
Ideally, I would like to record
the complete collection of sonatas.

474
00:49:51,951 --> 00:49:54,821
Though I think I still need
a couple more years for the late ones.

475
00:49:54,954 --> 00:49:58,038
- Could you do me a favor?
- What?

476
00:49:59,959 --> 00:50:02,830
Would play the
"Bagatelle in G Minor" for me?

477
00:50:05,964 --> 00:50:07,957
I haven't played it in a while.

478
00:50:10,719 --> 00:50:12,712
I don't remember it very well.

479
00:50:13,138 --> 00:50:16,388
- If you want, I can give it a try.
- Give it a try.

480
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:19,175
Okay.

481
00:52:16,593 --> 00:52:17,791
What's the matter?

482
00:53:58,861 --> 00:54:00,319
What are you doing?

483
00:54:03,824 --> 00:54:05,983
Have you completely lost your mind?

484
00:54:06,619 --> 00:54:08,278
I can't believe it.

485
00:54:29,808 --> 00:54:31,552
See what you have done.

486
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:35,809
Can't you call me
if you need something?

487
00:54:36,105 --> 00:54:37,350
I'm sorry.

488
00:54:37,523 --> 00:54:39,812
Yeah, I am too.

489
00:54:40,693 --> 00:54:41,808
Sorry.

490
00:54:43,238 --> 00:54:45,645
The lamp is broken, too.

491
00:55:18,022 --> 00:55:18,971
Yes?

492
00:55:22,067 --> 00:55:23,230
Who's there?

493
00:56:01,690 --> 00:56:03,101
Anybody here?

494
00:56:08,322 --> 00:56:09,601
Is there anybody here?

495
00:56:47,735 --> 00:56:50,570
Georges, what's the matter?
What's going on?

496
00:56:51,781 --> 00:56:54,189
Calm down, will you.

497
00:56:59,913 --> 00:57:01,408
What was it?

498
00:57:09,757 --> 00:57:12,793
Eva. They're coming on the 12th.

499
00:57:14,970 --> 00:57:16,133
Why?

500
00:57:16,806 --> 00:57:20,756
No idea.
Apparently, she's coming with Geoff.

501
00:57:22,143 --> 00:57:23,388
When is it?

502
00:57:23,937 --> 00:57:26,772
I don't know exactly.
What day is it today?

503
00:57:28,775 --> 00:57:30,104
I'll go and look.

504
00:57:35,782 --> 00:57:37,063
I don't want that.

505
00:57:38,619 --> 00:57:39,449
What?

506
00:57:39,620 --> 00:57:42,574
Geoff doesn't need to come.
It's not necessary.

507
00:57:46,376 --> 00:57:49,246
I don't need any comments
on my predicament.

508
00:57:50,380 --> 00:57:53,796
I can only take his British humor
in small doses.

509
00:59:20,928 --> 00:59:23,762
Dear Mrs. Laurent
and Mr. Laurent.

510
00:59:24,597 --> 00:59:27,598
It was beautiful
and yet sad to see you.

511
00:59:27,892 --> 00:59:31,143
My heartfelt wishes
that things will get better.

512
00:59:31,271 --> 00:59:35,600
With deepest sympathy,
your former pupil, Alexandre.

513
00:59:55,545 --> 00:59:57,039
Stop the CD.

514
01:00:46,178 --> 01:00:48,005
Where are the photo albums?

515
01:00:49,306 --> 01:00:51,844
The photo albums?
I don't know.

516
01:00:52,643 --> 01:00:55,893
In the small bedroom, I think.
Why?

517
01:00:56,397 --> 01:00:58,224
Can you get them for me?

518
01:00:58,983 --> 01:01:00,062
Now?

519
01:01:01,359 --> 01:01:02,770
But why now?

520
01:01:03,111 --> 01:01:04,819
I'd like to look at them.

521
01:01:07,824 --> 01:01:09,153
Please.

522
01:01:41,524 --> 01:01:42,604
Thank you.

523
01:01:43,693 --> 01:01:44,808
You're welcome.

524
01:02:53,178 --> 01:02:54,376
It's beautiful.

525
01:02:55,222 --> 01:02:56,218
What?

526
01:02:56,807 --> 01:02:58,052
Life.

527
01:03:01,187 --> 01:03:02,596
So long.

528
01:03:09,361 --> 01:03:10,903
Long life.

529
01:03:16,952 --> 01:03:18,909
Stop watching me.

530
01:03:20,205 --> 01:03:22,032
I wasn't watching you.

531
01:03:24,209 --> 01:03:28,420
Of course you were.
I'm not that dumb yet.

532
01:03:29,964 --> 01:03:33,629
... the focus will be as much
on the how as on the what.

533
01:03:34,135 --> 01:03:36,092
Benjamin Netanyahu,

534
01:03:36,346 --> 01:03:40,924
is finally granted an official visit
with all the honours:

535
01:03:41,184 --> 01:03:45,846
handshake photo,
joint press conference,

536
01:03:46,106 --> 01:03:51,941
conspicuously demonstrating
the renewal of ties between Isreal...

537
01:03:52,403 --> 01:03:54,230
Israel and the United States.

538
01:04:46,039 --> 01:04:47,414
You're soaked through.

539
01:04:49,084 --> 01:04:51,753
- What do you mean?
- Hang on.

540
01:05:09,395 --> 01:05:10,806
It's no big deal.

541
01:05:32,335 --> 01:05:33,366
Come on.

542
01:05:51,980 --> 01:05:53,010
Wait.

543
01:06:48,451 --> 01:06:49,649
Don't get all worked up.

544
01:06:52,664 --> 01:06:54,538
Calm down, calm down.

545
01:06:56,751 --> 01:06:58,425
... thinking about
whether it wouldn't be better

546
01:06:58,687 --> 01:07:00,410
to invest the money
in an apartment block.

547
01:07:01,965 --> 01:07:06,211
If inflation gets going again,
property is the only sure thing.

548
01:07:07,011 --> 01:07:12,053
Right now,
savings accounts pay 1.75% at best.

549
01:07:12,308 --> 01:07:14,016
That's a good rate already.

550
01:07:15,144 --> 01:07:18,478
Four years ago, Geoff bought

551
01:07:18,773 --> 01:07:22,522
shares for a small amount of money,
and the whole thing collapsed.

552
01:07:22,694 --> 01:07:26,312
So now we're obviously worried.

553
01:07:28,700 --> 01:07:30,241
In the meantime,

554
01:07:31,952 --> 01:07:36,116
other people have had the same idea
and property prices are soaring.

555
01:07:41,087 --> 01:07:42,666
Since I came back from Scandinavia,

556
01:07:42,875 --> 01:07:45,204
I spend my spare time
going through the classifieds.

557
01:07:55,809 --> 01:07:57,137
We'll see.

558
01:07:58,270 --> 01:08:01,224
It takes time.
We'll find something in the end.

559
01:08:12,952 --> 01:08:15,158
I have...

560
01:08:17,164 --> 01:08:19,120
the grandmother...

561
01:08:21,584 --> 01:08:25,452
woman with house...

562
01:08:27,424 --> 01:08:28,752
not...

563
01:08:31,595 --> 01:08:32,970
house then...

564
01:08:36,892 --> 01:08:38,303
money...

565
01:08:46,317 --> 01:08:49,982
I'm... Sorry, Mum,
I don't understand you.

566
01:08:50,822 --> 01:08:53,064
I don't understand
what you say.

567
01:08:57,495 --> 01:08:58,658
yes...

568
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:00,361
straight away...

569
01:09:03,335 --> 01:09:04,829
it's all...

570
01:09:07,005 --> 01:09:09,412
house sel...

571
01:09:11,634 --> 01:09:12,962
sel...

572
01:09:16,806 --> 01:09:20,424
not...
in two strokes...

573
01:09:24,814 --> 01:09:26,723
so quickly...

574
01:09:31,945 --> 01:09:33,143
God...

575
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:37,032
it's hard...

576
01:09:38,952 --> 01:09:40,447
say...

577
01:09:41,455 --> 01:09:43,780
house sol...

578
01:09:45,417 --> 01:09:48,335
money gone...

579
01:09:50,673 --> 01:09:52,001
gone...

580
01:09:55,344 --> 01:10:01,512
al...so the... the... the... the... hou...se

581
01:10:01,933 --> 01:10:02,965
Yes.

582
01:10:06,813 --> 01:10:08,142
Whose house?

583
01:10:13,737 --> 01:10:14,733
The house of...

584
01:10:14,863 --> 01:10:18,197
also... grandmother...

585
01:10:19,034 --> 01:10:20,942
grandmother...

586
01:10:45,685 --> 01:10:47,511
Three times a week.

587
01:10:47,895 --> 01:10:51,478
I'm not experienced enough.
We'll see if that's enough.

588
01:10:51,691 --> 01:10:53,399
How much is she asking?

589
01:10:54,068 --> 01:10:57,437
It's paid by the hour.
We'll see.

590
01:10:59,324 --> 01:11:00,023
And her?

591
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:02,149
Anne?

592
01:11:03,953 --> 01:11:05,412
It's hard to say.

593
01:11:05,538 --> 01:11:10,034
Sometimes I get the feeling she's
totally unaware of the state she's in.

594
01:11:10,167 --> 01:11:12,492
But in the next moment
I feel the opposite.

595
01:11:13,337 --> 01:11:14,915
And what does the doctor say?

596
01:11:15,756 --> 01:11:16,670
He...

597
01:11:21,429 --> 01:11:23,220
She only talks gibberish.

598
01:11:34,316 --> 01:11:35,940
What's going on?

599
01:11:37,152 --> 01:11:39,643
We can't just leave her lying
on her bed like that!

600
01:11:39,780 --> 01:11:42,187
She's unrecognizable!
It's ridiculous!

601
01:11:42,366 --> 01:11:43,953
There's nothing we can do
at the moment.

602
01:11:44,180 --> 01:11:46,676
She's undergoing treatment,
gets medication.

603
01:11:48,539 --> 01:11:50,697
There are no other options
right now.

604
01:11:50,833 --> 01:11:53,999
What does that mean, "no other options"?
Why not put her in the hospital?

605
01:11:55,421 --> 01:11:57,212
She had a second stroke.

606
01:11:58,047 --> 01:11:59,625
Bertier examined her

607
01:11:59,758 --> 01:12:03,672
and felt we could spare her
all the hospital inpatient procedures.

608
01:12:03,845 --> 01:12:06,253
Anyway, they wouldn't keep her.

609
01:12:06,473 --> 01:12:09,640
They'd send her to a care home
with nursing.

610
01:12:10,185 --> 01:12:13,388
What they do in those places,
we can do here.

611
01:12:13,605 --> 01:12:17,270
And she won't be put in a care home.

612
01:12:18,568 --> 01:12:20,229
I promised her that.

613
01:12:21,488 --> 01:12:24,405
Don't you think
you're taking on too much?

614
01:12:24,824 --> 01:12:26,733
Have you got a better idea?

615
01:12:31,372 --> 01:12:36,200
I can't believe that these days
there is not a more effective treatment.

616
01:12:36,503 --> 01:12:38,958
No one's stopping you
from finding out.

617
01:12:41,049 --> 01:12:44,833
I take it you believe me when I say
I love your mother as much as you do.

618
01:12:44,970 --> 01:12:47,673
So please, don't treat me
as if I was a total idiot

619
01:12:47,805 --> 01:12:50,806
incapable of doing the obvious.

620
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:52,760
I didn't say that.

621
01:12:53,769 --> 01:12:57,269
I'm simply questioning whether what I
see going on here is the best solution.

622
01:12:58,107 --> 01:12:59,850
Don't you want to get
a second opinion?

623
01:13:00,526 --> 01:13:02,435
Stop it, both of you.

624
01:13:03,070 --> 01:13:06,321
Another doctor did come.
He agrees with Bertier.

625
01:13:06,616 --> 01:13:09,682
From Monday, a nurse will come
three times a week.

626
01:13:10,031 --> 01:13:11,227
Is that good enough?

627
01:13:11,506 --> 01:13:14,301
Now can we talk
about something else?

628
01:13:18,168 --> 01:13:19,248
Like what?

629
01:13:20,254 --> 01:13:22,923
a republican awakening by a president

630
01:13:23,048 --> 01:13:25,718
who has secluded himself
in the Élysée Palace for the weekend.

631
01:13:25,843 --> 01:13:29,176
He's cancelled everything,
doors are closed, his schedule is empty.

632
01:13:29,305 --> 01:13:32,721
All that's on his mind right now is to
prepare his appearance on France 2.

633
01:13:32,850 --> 01:13:36,799
This appearance will be in the form of
an interview conducted by David Pujadas

634
01:13:36,937 --> 01:13:43,271
because his previous interview in January
was conducted by TF1's Laurence Ferrari.

635
01:13:43,485 --> 01:13:50,216
France Inter will broadcast a special
programme tomorrow between 9 and 10 p.m.

636
01:13:50,378 --> 01:13:52,885
where we'll analyse
and comment the interview…

637
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:56,703
... and behind the shoulder. You turn.
And behind the buttocks.

638
01:13:56,874 --> 01:14:00,538
Hold like this, with the elbow.
And we put the nappy on.

639
01:14:03,379 --> 01:14:05,171
Straighten your back.

640
01:14:05,715 --> 01:14:07,257
Straighten it.

641
01:14:07,884 --> 01:14:13,258
Then gently roll back,
straighten your leg.

642
01:14:18,311 --> 01:14:21,016
Could you grap the sheet down there?
I'll help you.

643
01:14:21,231 --> 01:14:23,140
Pull, pull, pull, pull.

644
01:14:23,316 --> 01:14:28,393
Now you pull the diaper.
Like this.

645
01:14:29,488 --> 01:14:30,817
That's it.

646
01:14:32,033 --> 01:14:34,072
And we lie down on the back.

647
01:14:37,163 --> 01:14:40,995
And you put the nappy on
and fasten the tapes.

648
01:15:50,235 --> 01:15:52,726
There, my love,
I hope you like it.

649
01:15:52,863 --> 01:15:54,108
Yes, yes.

650
01:16:15,927 --> 01:16:18,762
I added some peach juice.

651
01:16:19,597 --> 01:16:21,590
I find it tastes quite good.

652
01:17:46,015 --> 01:17:49,266
Come on, Anne, my love,
you've only swallowed three mouthfuls.

653
01:18:16,295 --> 01:18:17,244
I'm sorry.

654
01:18:49,620 --> 01:18:53,202
Mum to the concert...

655
01:18:57,419 --> 01:18:58,415
Yes?

656
01:19:01,006 --> 01:19:04,007
Mum to the concert...

657
01:19:08,013 --> 01:19:09,591
No... no dress...

658
01:19:11,934 --> 01:19:14,259
No dress, mum to the concert.

659
01:19:14,395 --> 01:19:16,885
Mum to the concert...

660
01:19:22,758 --> 01:19:23,308
No!

661
01:19:27,699 --> 01:19:30,155
I'll also wash the other one.

662
01:19:41,337 --> 01:19:43,495
That's it.
Now we only wash off the soap.

663
01:19:46,884 --> 01:19:49,458
Does the temperature suit you?

664
01:19:50,012 --> 01:19:54,224
No? I'm bending you forward.
Don't be afraid, I'm here.

665
01:19:57,687 --> 01:19:59,062
Very well.

666
01:20:10,199 --> 01:20:15,075
... come from 8 till 12
and I'd do 2 until 6, or 3 to 7.

667
01:20:15,287 --> 01:20:16,830
I'll think about it.

668
01:20:16,956 --> 01:20:18,913
She just has to know in time
so she can plan ahead.

669
01:20:19,041 --> 01:20:21,449
Of course. I'll let you know
in the next few days.

670
01:20:21,711 --> 01:20:24,166
Very well.
I have to go now.

671
01:20:26,549 --> 01:20:29,253
- Thanks for the coffee.
- My pleasure.

672
01:20:30,761 --> 01:20:32,041
I'll see you out.

673
01:20:44,316 --> 01:20:48,266
You mustn't take it too seriously.
Usually they always say something.

674
01:20:48,487 --> 01:20:51,192
She might just as well say
"Mum, Mum, Mum".

675
01:20:51,323 --> 01:20:54,074
- It's just mechanical.
- I know.

676
01:21:01,875 --> 01:21:04,117
- Goodbye, sir.
- Goodbye.

677
01:21:59,432 --> 01:22:02,267
I'd like to hire a second nurse.

678
01:22:03,645 --> 01:22:05,885
The two could take turns.

679
01:22:06,980 --> 01:22:08,854
That would make everything
a bit simpler, wouldn't it?

680
01:22:10,901 --> 01:22:12,312
What do you think?

681
01:22:18,579 --> 01:22:19,746
Hurts.

682
01:22:23,019 --> 01:22:24,186
Hurts.

683
01:22:27,397 --> 01:22:28,565
Hurts.

684
01:22:30,177 --> 01:22:31,345
Hurts.

685
01:22:34,424 --> 01:22:37,211
- Please leave them in the kitchen.
- Yes.

686
01:22:39,179 --> 01:22:40,459
I'm back!

687
01:22:51,483 --> 01:22:52,646
Thank you.

688
01:22:59,324 --> 01:23:01,032
Is there anything else
I can do for you?

689
01:23:01,159 --> 01:23:03,317
No, thank you.
You've been a big help, Mr. Méry.

690
01:23:03,453 --> 01:23:05,611
It's nothing, sir.
Thanks a lot, sir.

691
01:23:05,997 --> 01:23:07,954
I'll let you know
if I need you again.

692
01:23:08,083 --> 01:23:09,743
With pleasure, sir.

693
01:23:10,627 --> 01:23:11,623
Goodbye.

694
01:23:15,048 --> 01:23:18,085
- May I say something, sir?
- Yes?

695
01:23:18,426 --> 01:23:23,800
My wife and I, we are very impressed
by your handling of the situation.

696
01:23:24,599 --> 01:23:25,844
I take my hat off to you.

697
01:23:26,309 --> 01:23:27,886
That's very kind of you.
Thank you.

698
01:23:31,022 --> 01:23:32,516
Until next time.

699
01:23:32,648 --> 01:23:35,603
- Give my regards to your wife.
- I certainly will.

700
01:23:41,407 --> 01:23:43,695
Hello Eva.
How are you?

701
01:23:50,291 --> 01:23:51,701
Things are fine.

702
01:23:55,004 --> 01:23:56,284
On...

703
01:24:01,345 --> 01:24:02,512
the...

704
01:24:04,230 --> 01:24:05,398
b...

705
01:24:05,806 --> 01:24:07,348
On the bridge...

706
01:24:07,516 --> 01:24:10,054
bridge of A...

707
01:24:10,310 --> 01:24:12,054
of Avignon...

708
01:24:14,064 --> 01:24:17,231
On the bridge of Avignon...

709
01:24:17,568 --> 01:24:19,192
the... the...

710
01:24:19,319 --> 01:24:21,526
- Come on, Anne.
- The bridge!

711
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:26,280
of Avignon...

712
01:24:26,410 --> 01:24:30,538
vi...vi...vignon...gnon

713
01:24:30,664 --> 01:24:33,333
On the bridge of Avignon

714
01:24:33,875 --> 01:24:35,915
we all dance there,
we all dance there

715
01:24:36,044 --> 01:24:38,879
- Dance!
- On the bridge of Avignon...

716
01:24:39,005 --> 01:24:41,792
- Dance!
- We all dance...

717
01:24:42,759 --> 01:24:45,546
- all... all...
- On the bridge of Avignon

718
01:24:45,720 --> 01:24:48,342
we all dance there,
we all dance there

719
01:24:48,515 --> 01:24:51,682
On the bridge of Avignon

720
01:24:52,060 --> 01:24:53,852
we all dance there in a ring

721
01:24:54,021 --> 01:24:56,096
On the bridge...

722
01:24:56,856 --> 01:24:59,228
dance... dance...

723
01:24:59,984 --> 01:25:02,060
all... all...

724
01:25:07,075 --> 01:25:08,355
There we are.

725
01:25:14,124 --> 01:25:16,911
Now you're all beautiful again.

726
01:25:17,752 --> 01:25:19,911
So everyone will admire you.

727
01:25:20,754 --> 01:25:21,834
That's it.

728
01:25:23,841 --> 01:25:26,166
You want to see?
Wait.

729
01:25:29,555 --> 01:25:30,883
Well?

730
01:25:32,099 --> 01:25:33,677
Aren't we a pretty sight?

731
01:26:18,812 --> 01:26:19,761
Shoo!

732
01:26:30,866 --> 01:26:31,945
Shoo!

733
01:26:39,582 --> 01:26:41,124
Shoo!

734
01:26:47,298 --> 01:26:49,042
As you wish, sir.

735
01:26:51,428 --> 01:26:54,097
I don't know
what you were expecting, but..

736
01:26:54,431 --> 01:26:57,384
I gave up another job
to come and work here.

737
01:26:57,892 --> 01:27:01,640
You should've thought it over before
if you'll need a second nurse or not.

738
01:27:01,896 --> 01:27:05,561
I didn't know then
how incompetent you are.

739
01:27:06,359 --> 01:27:07,557
What's that supposed to mean?

740
01:27:07,693 --> 01:27:11,359
I don't want to discuss it with you.
Anyway, you wouldn't understand.

741
01:27:11,906 --> 01:27:13,863
No one has ever reprimanded me.

742
01:27:13,991 --> 01:27:16,827
Good for you.
How much do I owe you?

743
01:27:20,290 --> 01:27:21,404
780 euro.

744
01:27:24,209 --> 01:27:26,783
I've never had anything like this
happen to me before.

745
01:27:28,088 --> 01:27:31,753
Who do you think you are?
I've been doing this job for years.

746
01:27:31,884 --> 01:27:34,126
I don't need you
to teach me how to do it.

747
01:27:34,261 --> 01:27:35,127
Do you have 20 euro?

748
01:27:43,896 --> 01:27:46,813
- No.
- Then take the 800 and go.

749
01:27:52,738 --> 01:27:54,944
You're a wicked old man.

750
01:27:56,366 --> 01:27:57,647
I feel sorry for you.

751
01:27:59,411 --> 01:28:00,671
I hope from the bottom of my heart

752
01:28:00,894 --> 01:28:03,853
that one day someone treats you
the same way you treat your patients,

753
01:28:04,875 --> 01:28:07,627
and that you too will have no way
of defending yourself.

754
01:28:07,795 --> 01:28:09,372
Now get out.

755
01:28:10,171 --> 01:28:11,665
Get out of here.

756
01:28:14,926 --> 01:28:17,417
Go fuck yourself, you old fart!

757
01:29:00,512 --> 01:29:02,719
Open your mouth, Anne.

758
01:29:04,058 --> 01:29:06,928
Come on, open your mouth.

759
01:29:10,314 --> 01:29:13,766
Anne! Please.

760
01:29:18,823 --> 01:29:19,902
Come on.

761
01:29:22,577 --> 01:29:23,774
Please.

762
01:29:28,206 --> 01:29:29,617
Stop it.

763
01:29:30,250 --> 01:29:32,207
If you don't drink, you'll die.

764
01:29:33,837 --> 01:29:34,667
Is that what you want?

765
01:29:40,552 --> 01:29:42,960
Come on.
Please.

766
01:29:52,689 --> 01:29:54,480
Christ almighty.

767
01:29:58,987 --> 01:30:01,858
You can't force me
to let you die of thirst.

768
01:30:02,699 --> 01:30:06,364
If you persist, I'll call Bertier
and he'll put you in hospital.

769
01:30:07,996 --> 01:30:11,993
They can force-feed you there.
Is that what you want?

770
01:30:15,378 --> 01:30:18,498
I promised to spare you that
but you must help me.

771
01:30:20,633 --> 01:30:22,293
I'm out of my depth.

772
01:30:25,597 --> 01:30:26,877
Come on, Anne.

773
01:30:35,482 --> 01:30:37,189
Drink this, now!

774
01:30:42,863 --> 01:30:45,533
That's it.
Good.

775
01:30:48,703 --> 01:30:49,983
Well, swallow it!

776
01:31:21,527 --> 01:31:22,855
Please, forgive me.

777
01:31:24,946 --> 01:31:26,025
I'm sorry.

778
01:32:40,354 --> 01:32:41,848
- Who's there?
- It's me.

779
01:32:42,189 --> 01:32:43,849
- Eva?
- Yes.

780
01:32:46,193 --> 01:32:47,687
Just a minute.

781
01:33:39,830 --> 01:33:41,490
- Hello.
- Hello.

782
01:33:43,166 --> 01:33:44,329
What was going on?

783
01:33:44,835 --> 01:33:46,744
Nothing.
I was in the toilet.

784
01:33:48,463 --> 01:33:49,792
No, come in.

785
01:34:01,184 --> 01:34:04,683
- Why this unannounced visit?
- What's going on with mum?

786
01:34:05,146 --> 01:34:08,313
Nothing.
What should be going on?

787
01:34:11,861 --> 01:34:13,688
Don't you want to sit down first?

788
01:34:20,911 --> 01:34:22,370
Why are you in Paris?

789
01:34:22,538 --> 01:34:26,370
What's going on with mum?
Why don't you answer the phone?

790
01:34:27,251 --> 01:34:29,959
Since our last conversation, I left
four messages on your answering machine.

791
01:34:30,168 --> 01:34:32,065
Why don't you call back?

792
01:34:32,798 --> 01:34:35,716
Sorry. I didn't listen to it.
Forgive me.

793
01:34:35,843 --> 01:34:38,132
Don't you realize we're worried?

794
01:34:40,305 --> 01:34:42,713
Your worries are no use to me.

795
01:34:43,267 --> 01:34:47,395
No, don't get me wrong.
I'm not criticizing you.

796
01:34:48,564 --> 01:34:51,565
I just don't have the time
to deal with your worries, that's all.

797
01:34:51,692 --> 01:34:55,191
- Dad...
- No, let's stop this conversation.

798
01:34:56,363 --> 01:35:00,492
Your mother is just as could have been
expected: bad the whole time.

799
01:35:01,911 --> 01:35:05,658
She is turning more and more
into a helpless child.

800
01:35:06,122 --> 01:35:09,159
It's sad and humiliating
for her and for me.

801
01:35:09,292 --> 01:35:12,044
And she doesn't want
to be seen in that state.

802
01:35:12,170 --> 01:35:16,120
Even the last time
she did not want you to come.

803
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:18,397
You two have your own life.
Nothing wrong with that.

804
01:35:18,606 --> 01:35:20,604
But let us have our life too.
Okay?

805
01:35:20,929 --> 01:35:23,171
Dad, what's the matter?

806
01:35:24,016 --> 01:35:27,301
Nothing.
Your visit caught me by surprise.

807
01:35:27,478 --> 01:35:32,304
And I'm annoyed that you show up here
to check that everything's okay.

808
01:35:32,899 --> 01:35:35,141
Who do you think you are?

809
01:35:40,865 --> 01:35:43,024
Stay here, please.

810
01:35:45,829 --> 01:35:47,027
Please!

811
01:35:58,674 --> 01:35:59,670
Mum?

812
01:36:03,804 --> 01:36:04,753
Mum!

813
01:36:13,690 --> 01:36:15,481
Tell me, what's going on?
Have you gone crazy?

814
01:36:15,608 --> 01:36:16,308
Sit down.

815
01:36:16,442 --> 01:36:19,229
I don't want to sit down.
What's going on here?

816
01:36:19,361 --> 01:36:23,110
Nothing's going on. I want to spare
us all a pointless drama.

817
01:36:23,741 --> 01:36:26,695
I presume your mother is asleep.
She sleeps all day.

818
01:36:27,161 --> 01:36:29,533
And then she wakes up at night.

819
01:36:30,873 --> 01:36:33,411
If you really want to,
we'll go and see her in a little while.

820
01:36:34,794 --> 01:36:36,288
Now, sit down.

821
01:36:50,392 --> 01:36:56,253
We do our speech exercises every day,
or we sing together.

822
01:36:58,108 --> 01:37:03,399
Usually I wake up around 5.
At that time, she's still awake.

823
01:37:03,906 --> 01:37:08,781
We change the nappy,
I rub cream on her to avoid bed sores.

824
01:37:09,869 --> 01:37:14,946
Then, around 7, I try to persuade her
to eat and drink.

825
01:37:16,334 --> 01:37:18,660
Sometimes it works, sometimes not.

826
01:37:19,170 --> 01:37:22,374
Sometimes she tells me things
from her childhood.

827
01:37:22,549 --> 01:37:25,087
Or calls for help for hours.

828
01:37:26,553 --> 01:37:29,886
Then, suddenly, she starts giggling.

829
01:37:31,098 --> 01:37:32,593
Or crying.

830
01:37:36,646 --> 01:37:39,516
Nothing of any of that
is worth showing.

831
01:37:44,153 --> 01:37:46,645
You can't forbid me
from seeing her.

832
01:37:49,951 --> 01:37:50,816
No.

833
01:38:53,930 --> 01:38:55,306
It's me, Mum.

834
01:39:10,780 --> 01:39:13,105
Can I do something for you?

835
01:39:23,793 --> 01:39:24,908
Mum.

836
01:39:26,588 --> 01:39:27,916
Mum.

837
01:39:28,465 --> 01:39:29,876
Mum.

838
01:39:32,885 --> 01:39:34,048
Mum.

839
01:40:42,496 --> 01:40:43,611
The tea isn't very hot any more.

840
01:40:48,084 --> 01:40:49,578
But it does make you feel better.

841
01:41:01,473 --> 01:41:02,504
Thanks.

842
01:41:17,989 --> 01:41:20,658
It was silly of me
to lock the door.

843
01:41:21,117 --> 01:41:22,362
I'm sorry.

844
01:41:23,036 --> 01:41:24,744
You took me by surprise.

845
01:41:26,915 --> 01:41:28,409
I'm sorry.

846
01:41:30,168 --> 01:41:31,627
What's going to happen now?

847
01:41:33,921 --> 01:41:35,415
What's going to happen now?

848
01:41:37,091 --> 01:41:40,839
The nurse comes
three times a week.

849
01:41:40,970 --> 01:41:44,552
Every two weeks Dr. Bertier
and the hairdresser come.

850
01:41:45,349 --> 01:41:47,674
That's what you wanted to know?
No?

851
01:41:49,979 --> 01:41:52,814
Things will go on
as they have done up until now.

852
01:41:54,400 --> 01:41:55,737
They'll go from bad to worse.

853
01:41:55,945 --> 01:41:58,132
Things will go on,
and then one day it will all be over.

854
01:42:00,238 --> 01:42:02,196
You can't go on like this, Dad.

855
01:42:02,324 --> 01:42:03,522
- No?
- No.

856
01:42:04,493 --> 01:42:06,070
What do you suggest?

857
01:42:06,787 --> 01:42:08,945
Can't we have a serious talk,
you and me?

858
01:42:09,915 --> 01:42:12,584
What do you call "a serious talk"?

859
01:42:13,627 --> 01:42:15,869
Do you want to have Mom live with you?

860
01:42:16,630 --> 01:42:18,804
Do you want to pack her off
to a care home?

861
01:42:19,013 --> 01:42:20,844
Is this what you want?

862
01:42:22,302 --> 01:42:25,801
Go on, talk to me seriously!

863
01:42:30,101 --> 01:42:31,845
All long...

864
01:42:33,063 --> 01:42:34,687
Ding dong...

865
01:42:38,443 --> 01:42:41,065
Yes, it swung to and fro.

866
01:42:41,196 --> 01:42:44,399
Yes, yes, to, fro.

867
01:42:44,700 --> 01:42:45,778
You...

868
01:42:47,493 --> 01:42:49,071
Very serious...

869
01:42:49,287 --> 01:42:50,567
Like that.

870
01:42:50,872 --> 01:42:51,903
Yes.

871
01:42:52,957 --> 01:42:54,036
Like that.

872
01:42:55,668 --> 01:42:56,783
Serious.

873
01:42:57,795 --> 01:42:59,954
Yes, I was very uptight.

874
01:43:00,423 --> 01:43:01,704
Yes.

875
01:43:02,801 --> 01:43:04,295
Up...tight.

876
01:43:08,765 --> 01:43:13,509
It... was... nice.

877
01:43:30,495 --> 01:43:32,072
Hurts.

878
01:43:36,041 --> 01:43:37,868
Hurts.

879
01:43:41,576 --> 01:43:42,431
Hurts.

880
01:43:54,727 --> 01:43:57,930
What's the matter.
Where do you hurt?

881
01:44:03,151 --> 01:44:04,562
What's going on?

882
01:44:05,570 --> 01:44:06,899
Is it the nappy?

883
01:44:07,697 --> 01:44:08,978
Is it full?

884
01:44:12,160 --> 01:44:13,571
Where do you hurt?

885
01:44:19,877 --> 01:44:23,790
It's all right, it's all right.
I'm here.

886
01:44:28,301 --> 01:44:29,581
Everything's fine.

887
01:44:34,307 --> 01:44:35,552
We will...

888
01:44:36,810 --> 01:44:39,135
Do you want me
to tell you a story?

889
01:44:41,398 --> 01:44:44,482
But you must be quiet,
I can't talk too loud.

890
01:44:45,986 --> 01:44:47,609
It wears me out.

891
01:44:51,907 --> 01:44:54,066
When I was little,

892
01:44:54,493 --> 01:44:57,494
well, I wasn't as little as all that,

893
01:44:57,955 --> 01:45:02,831
I think it was
toward the end of primary school,

894
01:45:03,169 --> 01:45:05,494
so I was about 10.

895
01:45:07,465 --> 01:45:11,463
Dad and mum had sent me
to a holiday camp.

896
01:45:11,885 --> 01:45:16,761
They thought it would do me good to
spend the summer with kids my own age.

897
01:45:18,142 --> 01:45:21,059
We were lodged in an old castle

898
01:45:23,772 --> 01:45:26,976
in the midst of the forest.
I think it was in the Auvergne.

899
01:45:28,069 --> 01:45:29,527
I don't remember.

900
01:45:30,446 --> 01:45:34,693
In any case it was the opposite
of what I'd expected.

901
01:45:37,953 --> 01:45:42,496
We had to get up at 6 in the morning
and plunge into a lake.

902
01:45:42,833 --> 01:45:45,953
It was a small lake
not far from the castle.

903
01:45:46,211 --> 01:45:50,291
It was fed by an icy mountain stream.

904
01:45:51,216 --> 01:45:55,048
We had to enter it running,
in a double file.

905
01:45:57,181 --> 01:46:00,216
You know,
I was never very sporty.

906
01:46:01,726 --> 01:46:09,043
They had worked out a programme
to keep us on the go all day,

907
01:46:11,361 --> 01:46:17,980
Probably to nip in... in the bud

908
01:46:18,660 --> 01:46:21,697
any potential pubescent impulses.

909
01:46:22,664 --> 01:46:24,822
But the worst thing was the food.

910
01:46:26,709 --> 01:46:32,794
The third day after our arrival,
there was rice pudding for lunch.

911
01:46:33,091 --> 01:46:35,000
I hate rice pudding.

912
01:46:35,593 --> 01:46:41,797
We sat at long tables in a huge hall.

913
01:46:42,308 --> 01:46:44,550
I didn't want to eat the stuff.

914
01:46:47,480 --> 01:46:50,644
One of the monitors said to me:

915
01:46:51,348 --> 01:46:55,607
"If you don't clear your plate,
you won't get out of here."

916
01:46:57,490 --> 01:47:00,823
So after the meal everybody left,

917
01:47:01,327 --> 01:47:04,494
and I remained alone, in tears.

918
01:47:07,291 --> 01:47:11,336
I had made a secret pact with mum.

919
01:47:11,796 --> 01:47:17,216
I was to write to her every week.
I was to send her a postcard.

920
01:47:17,467 --> 01:47:23,340
If I liked the stay,
I was to draw flowers,

921
01:47:23,891 --> 01:47:26,346
if not, stars.

922
01:47:27,353 --> 01:47:32,691
She kept the card.
It was covered all over in stars.

923
01:47:35,069 --> 01:47:38,816
After three hours,
I was finally allowed to get out.

924
01:47:40,448 --> 01:47:44,114
I went up to my room,
got into bed

925
01:47:44,953 --> 01:47:47,278
I had a fever of over 40 degrees.

926
01:47:48,039 --> 01:47:49,534
It was diphtheria.

927
01:47:50,751 --> 01:47:55,578
I was taken
to the nearest hospital

928
01:47:56,089 --> 01:47:58,296
and sent to quarantine.

929
01:47:59,134 --> 01:48:02,383
Which meant that mum,
when she came to visit me,

930
01:48:03,054 --> 01:48:06,304
could only wave at me
through a window.

931
01:48:11,563 --> 01:48:13,970
At some point I lost that postcard.

932
01:48:16,025 --> 01:48:17,354
It's a pity.

933
01:59:13,214 --> 01:59:16,417
... you won't believe it.
A pigeon came in,

934
01:59:16,551 --> 01:59:19,967
for the second time already,
through the light well.

935
01:59:20,096 --> 01:59:24,508
This time I caught it.
In fact it wasn't difficult at all.

936
01:59:24,641 --> 01:59:26,967
But I set it free again.

937
02:01:22,425 --> 02:01:24,133
I'm almost done.

938
02:01:28,430 --> 02:01:30,423
You can put your shoes on if you want.

939
02:02:40,126 --> 02:02:41,324
Thank you.

940
02:02:49,260 --> 02:02:51,087
Aren't you taking a coat?
