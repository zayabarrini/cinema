1
00:00:41,292 --> 00:00:42,708
Cait!

2
00:00:47,625 --> 00:00:49,083
Cait!

3
00:00:58,333 --> 00:00:59,875
Cait!

4
00:01:08,125 --> 00:01:09,750
Where are you?

5
00:01:19,708 --> 00:01:21,500
Mam is looking for you!

6
00:01:30,792 --> 00:01:32,167
Cait!

7
00:01:35,417 --> 00:01:36,708
Cait!

8
00:01:48,833 --> 00:01:50,833
Cait, I'm warning you!

9
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:08,083
Girls! Did you find her?

10
00:02:08,292 --> 00:02:09,708
No!

11
00:02:41,667 --> 00:02:43,667
There's muck on your shoes.

12
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:05,542
The Quiet Girl

13
00:03:10,792 --> 00:03:14,292
Mam said the calf will be born
the same week as the baby.

14
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,833
They will be twins!

15
00:03:17,042 --> 00:03:19,875
We'll have to pick a name for it.

16
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:22,833
How does the calf
get into the mammy's belly?

17
00:03:23,042 --> 00:03:27,125
The bull pushes the calf into her.
Everyone knows that.

18
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:29,417
Grainne, that's not how it happens.

19
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:31,875
It is!
Fiona Geraghty saw their bull..!

20
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:49,917
-Fiona Geraghty is an idiot.
-She's not an idiot!

21
00:03:57,257 --> 00:03:58,318
Fuck sake...

22
00:04:08,042 --> 00:04:10,708
She hasn't made the lunches.

23
00:04:11,787 --> 00:04:15,287
Dad! Mom didn't make the lunches!

24
00:04:17,479 --> 00:04:19,979
You know what?
Pick a bread or something.

25
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,786
It really pisses me off!

26
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:31,208
"There was a sadness...

27
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:36,167
"..upon the...

28
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:37,958
People.

29
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:39,542
"..people...

30
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:42,083
"..who were...

31
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:48,042
Left.

32
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:50,667
"left."

33
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:53,042
Siobhan, continue reading.

34
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:56,917
"..but the king said
they were most welcome.

35
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:59,958
"The prince was overjoyed.

36
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:03,125
"They were travelling
on a great ship..."

37
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:50,083
-Pick one.
-Green.

38
00:05:53,524 --> 00:05:55,200
Your sister is such a weirdo.

39
00:05:57,062 --> 00:06:00,622
My mother and your mother
were hanging out their clothes!

40
00:06:00,714 --> 00:06:04,267
My mother came to your mother
and punch in the nose!

41
00:06:04,351 --> 00:06:06,173
What color was the blood?

42
00:08:21,635 --> 00:08:22,841
How's it going?

43
00:08:26,226 --> 00:08:27,226
What?

44
00:08:30,923 --> 00:08:32,242
Which one is she?

45
00:08:34,209 --> 00:08:35,502
That's the wonder.

46
00:08:40,698 --> 00:08:42,875
Have you anything to say for yourself?

47
00:08:46,934 --> 00:08:49,090
Don't stop at me on the street either.

48
00:08:49,994 --> 00:08:51,950
It's enough from here to your home.

49
00:08:54,853 --> 00:08:56,653
Would you prefer if I let you off?

50
00:08:58,131 --> 00:08:59,571
Don't be fucking like that.

51
00:08:59,655 --> 00:09:01,341
I can let you off, if you want.

52
00:09:03,854 --> 00:09:05,000
Help yourself.

53
00:09:36,531 --> 00:09:37,464
Dan.

54
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,250
Huh?

55
00:09:40,117 --> 00:09:41,599
Dan, did you hear me?

56
00:09:41,984 --> 00:09:42,984
What?

57
00:09:43,195 --> 00:09:45,636
Could you put your horses down
for one minute?

58
00:09:46,857 --> 00:09:48,839
Alright then. What do you want?

59
00:09:48,923 --> 00:09:50,542
How long should they keep her?

60
00:09:51,145 --> 00:09:52,557
Till after the baby?

61
00:09:53,572 --> 00:09:55,664
She can take her
for as long as they like.

62
00:09:56,496 --> 00:09:57,942
Is that what I'll say?

63
00:09:58,176 --> 00:09:59,949
They are your people, aren't it?

64
00:10:01,299 --> 00:10:03,746
You are some help of a man.

65
00:10:04,246 --> 00:10:05,446
Do you know that?

66
00:10:06,686 --> 00:10:08,366
Say whatever you want to say so.

67
00:10:09,019 --> 00:10:10,725
Isn't that what you always do?

68
00:10:27,094 --> 00:10:28,314
Just the one today.

69
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:43,208
Letter for you.

70
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:49,792
Leave it on the table.

71
00:11:40,292 --> 00:11:42,125
Cait.

72
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:43,750
Yes?

73
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,917
Come here.

74
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:50,569
Where are they?

75
00:11:51,755 --> 00:11:53,182
Look further in the field. There.

76
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:55,375
Girls!

77
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:58,083
Cait is leaving!

78
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:00,875
Wait for us! We're coming!

79
00:12:00,718 --> 00:12:02,342
Let's go, in the name of God.

80
00:12:47,526 --> 00:12:49,545
Waterford, 3:1.

81
00:12:52,461 --> 00:12:54,141
That's where we're going.

82
00:12:54,225 --> 00:12:56,298
Aye, sure in that way I put a bet on them.

83
00:13:01,878 --> 00:13:03,318
My dear, that's in it.

84
00:13:09,053 --> 00:13:10,395
Fuck yeah, I knew it!

85
00:13:12,486 --> 00:13:14,706
Useless showy bastards.

86
00:14:20,842 --> 00:14:22,308
Oh, shit.

87
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,780
Dan, what way are you?

88
00:14:31,897 --> 00:14:33,552
- Sean.
- Get out of here.

89
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:36,206
How was the drive down?

90
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:37,677
As it should happen.

91
00:14:39,016 --> 00:14:41,042
Three hours in a car is no joke, mate.

92
00:14:41,383 --> 00:14:43,877
We've got a power of sunshine
these past weeks.

93
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:47,397
Priest had us praying
for rain this morning.

94
00:14:48,014 --> 00:14:49,480
That'd be good if you do.

95
00:14:55,082 --> 00:14:56,202
How's the farm?

96
00:15:02,917 --> 00:15:05,792
Well, look at this girl!

97
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:10,083
Stand out so I can
have a proper look at you.

98
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:23,708
The last time I saw you,
you were in the pram.

99
00:15:23,917 --> 00:15:25,417
Did you know that?

100
00:15:27,167 --> 00:15:31,583
-The pram is broken.
-What happened to it at all?

101
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:38,417
My sisters used it as a wheelbarrow
and one of the wheels fell off.

102
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,375
Come on in, child.

103
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:21,583
Sit down if you'd like, pet.

104
00:16:21,792 --> 00:16:23,458
Make yourself at home.

105
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:29,583
How is your mammy?

106
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:33,875
She won ten pounds
on the Prize Bonds.

107
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:35,958
She did not.

108
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:38,833
She did. We had jelly.

109
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,292
Wasn't that a treat?

110
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:51,583
I'd say she's busy.

111
00:16:51,792 --> 00:16:53,167
Your mother?

112
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:57,917
She's waiting for the men
to come and cut the hay.

113
00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:01,417
Have you not cut the hay yet?

114
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:04,875
You're late.

115
00:17:07,417 --> 00:17:09,083
Are there any children here?

116
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:15,375
There's only myself and Sean
in the house, pet.

117
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:16,835
They are in here, aren't they?

118
00:17:21,096 --> 00:17:22,102
Hello, Missus.

119
00:17:23,195 --> 00:17:24,182
Dan.

120
00:17:28,036 --> 00:17:30,051
There's a scorcher of a day, huh?

121
00:17:30,135 --> 00:17:31,508
’Tis hot, surely.

122
00:17:35,046 --> 00:17:37,254
No fields be glad of a sip of rain.

123
00:17:37,855 --> 00:17:39,561
That would've rain long enough.

124
00:17:40,825 --> 00:17:43,265
Aren't you saying hello to our guest?

125
00:17:43,349 --> 00:17:44,700
Here's herself, then?

126
00:17:45,048 --> 00:17:46,905
"Herself" has a name.

127
00:17:46,989 --> 00:17:49,909
Great year for the hay all the same.
Jeez, I've never seen the like of it.

128
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:52,870
Loft is full to capacity.

129
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:57,300
Near clipped me head off
on the rafters pitching in the hay.

130
00:17:59,037 --> 00:18:01,210
Now. How bad!

131
00:18:03,725 --> 00:18:05,351
What way is Mary?

132
00:18:06,286 --> 00:18:07,698
She's nearing her time.

133
00:18:09,417 --> 00:18:11,527
I suppose,
the last puppy is getting hardy?

134
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:14,916
Aye.

135
00:18:15,805 --> 00:18:17,900
It's the feeding them that's the trouble.

136
00:18:17,949 --> 00:18:19,332
There’s no appetite like a child’s

137
00:18:19,415 --> 00:18:21,232
and, believe you me,
this one here is no different.

138
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:25,465
Well, we all eat in spurts,
the same as we grow.

139
00:18:25,549 --> 00:18:27,825
She’ll ate but you can work her.

140
00:18:28,046 --> 00:18:29,867
There's no need for any of that.

141
00:18:31,362 --> 00:18:33,042
We keep the child gladly.

142
00:18:34,086 --> 00:18:35,766
She's more than welcome.

143
00:18:39,593 --> 00:18:41,552
She’ll ate you out of your house and home.

144
00:18:44,521 --> 00:18:47,504
But I don't suppose there'll be a word
about that this time twelve months.

145
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:52,250
I have to pee.

146
00:19:36,242 --> 00:19:37,321
Now.

147
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:39,525
I’d better hit the road.

148
00:19:40,353 --> 00:19:41,807
What hurry is on you?

149
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:45,464
Long drive back.

150
00:19:46,463 --> 00:19:48,100
The spuds to spray yet.

151
00:19:49,204 --> 00:19:53,057
There's no fear of blight these evenings.
Back in a minute.

152
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,179
Give this to Mary.

153
00:20:29,263 --> 00:20:32,194
I'm snowed under with rhubarb
whatever kind of year it is.

154
00:20:44,792 --> 00:20:45,958
Now.

155
00:21:12,397 --> 00:21:13,750
Good luck to you now.

156
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:17,930
Try not to fall into the fire, you.

157
00:21:52,167 --> 00:21:54,125
Are you all right, love?

158
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:02,625
Lord God, he left with
the poor girl's suitcase in the car.

159
00:22:19,292 --> 00:22:21,208
In you go.

160
00:22:23,958 --> 00:22:27,208
-It's hot.
-You'll get used to it.

161
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:02,958
Now, your clothes.

162
00:23:04,958 --> 00:23:06,875
I don't have any clothes.

163
00:23:07,083 --> 00:23:10,250
Would some of our old things
do you for now?

164
00:23:10,458 --> 00:23:12,958
-I don't mind.
-Good girl.

165
00:23:25,625 --> 00:23:26,958
Now.

166
00:23:29,958 --> 00:23:33,750
My mam says
I have to change my pants every day.

167
00:23:34,958 --> 00:23:37,583
What else does your mother say?

168
00:23:39,333 --> 00:23:42,958
That you can keep me
for as long as you like.

169
00:23:45,208 --> 00:23:49,042
Now, will you come down
to the well with me?

170
00:23:50,083 --> 00:23:51,458
Now?

171
00:23:53,083 --> 00:23:54,958
Does now not suit you?

172
00:23:56,458 --> 00:23:58,250
Is it a secret?

173
00:23:59,708 --> 00:24:01,583
What?

174
00:24:02,708 --> 00:24:04,833
Am I not supposed to tell?

175
00:24:06,125 --> 00:24:08,917
There are no secrets in this house.

176
00:24:09,083 --> 00:24:10,917
Do you hear me?

177
00:24:14,333 --> 00:24:16,083
Do you hear me?

178
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:20,083
-Yes.
-Yes, what?

179
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:23,083
Yes, there are no secrets
in this house.

180
00:24:25,917 --> 00:24:29,875
If there are secrets in a house,
there is shame in that house.

181
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:34,042
We don't want any shame here.

182
00:24:37,958 --> 00:24:39,375
OK.

183
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:45,250
You're too young to understand.

184
00:24:47,777 --> 00:24:48,816
Come on.

185
00:25:28,125 --> 00:25:29,750
Look at that.

186
00:25:29,958 --> 00:25:34,417
You wouldn't think
we've had no rain all month.

187
00:25:40,583 --> 00:25:42,208
Drink some.

188
00:25:47,208 --> 00:25:48,958
Now, be careful.

189
00:25:49,125 --> 00:25:50,750
It's deep.

190
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:37,750
Now, do you want to bring
a cup of hot milk up with you?

191
00:26:39,208 --> 00:26:42,208
Mam doesn't let me drink anything
before bed.

192
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:44,708
Well...

193
00:26:45,792 --> 00:26:48,042
..we'll stick with Mammy's way so.

194
00:26:49,792 --> 00:26:53,708
Sean, Cait is going to bed.

195
00:26:54,417 --> 00:26:55,875
Good night.

196
00:26:59,083 --> 00:27:00,708
We'll go up.

197
00:27:11,833 --> 00:27:14,750
Oh, pardon me.
Would you prefer I left it open?

198
00:27:20,792 --> 00:27:22,583
Are you afraid of the dark?

199
00:27:27,375 --> 00:27:28,792
Don't mind me.

200
00:27:42,167 --> 00:27:44,208
Are you OK?

201
00:27:47,208 --> 00:27:49,250
Is your mammy OK?

202
00:27:51,167 --> 00:27:53,042
What do you mean?

203
00:27:53,208 --> 00:27:56,208
Your mammy, is she OK?

204
00:27:59,167 --> 00:28:04,542
She'd been throwing up until
recently, but she's stopped now.

205
00:28:11,625 --> 00:28:14,625
Why isn't the hay in?

206
00:28:17,125 --> 00:28:19,917
She doesn't have enough
to pay the man.

207
00:28:20,958 --> 00:28:22,417
God help her.

208
00:28:27,333 --> 00:28:30,625
Would she be offended
if I sent her some money?

209
00:28:32,958 --> 00:28:37,417
-Offended?
-Would she be cross?

210
00:28:38,708 --> 00:28:41,917
She wouldn't, but Dad would.

211
00:28:44,208 --> 00:28:45,750
Your father.

212
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:52,292
Goodnight, pet.

213
00:29:58,333 --> 00:29:59,958
God help you.

214
00:30:04,125 --> 00:30:05,958
If you were mine...

215
00:30:08,083 --> 00:30:11,458
..I would never leave you
in a house with strangers.

216
00:30:36,583 --> 00:30:38,625
Did you sleep well, love?

217
00:30:44,625 --> 00:30:46,833
Lord God Almighty.

218
00:30:47,042 --> 00:30:48,458
Look at that.

219
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:57,833
These old mattresses.
They're always weeping.

220
00:30:58,042 --> 00:31:00,958
What was I thinking
putting you on one of these?

221
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:05,208
Take off the pyjamas, good girl.

222
00:31:16,917 --> 00:31:19,250
It's time.

223
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:23,333
Do you want to bring Cait
with you today?

224
00:31:23,542 --> 00:31:25,500
Show her the farm?

225
00:31:25,708 --> 00:31:28,292
The work will be
a little difficult this week.

226
00:31:29,708 --> 00:31:32,333
-Will it?
-Another time, maybe.

227
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:42,542
Well.

228
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:44,125
If so...

229
00:31:46,375 --> 00:31:48,417
..we'll begin.

230
00:32:00,708 --> 00:32:02,500
You need to be careful with it.

231
00:32:05,917 --> 00:32:07,750
Twenty-three...

232
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:10,167
..twenty-four...

233
00:32:11,167 --> 00:32:12,583
twenty-five...

234
00:32:13,958 --> 00:32:15,542
twenty-six...

235
00:32:17,042 --> 00:32:18,417
twenty-seven...

236
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,958
..twenty-eight.

237
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:27,667
It's a secret.

238
00:32:28,375 --> 00:32:32,583
Not many people know about it,
but it does wonders for the skin.

239
00:32:34,083 --> 00:32:37,708
Look at me, I haven't so much
as a pimple.

240
00:32:41,333 --> 00:32:44,375
I thought there were no secrets
in this house.

241
00:32:45,958 --> 00:32:47,667
Well...

242
00:32:47,875 --> 00:32:49,792
..this is different.

243
00:32:50,958 --> 00:32:54,417
More like a secret recipe.

244
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:05,292
Forty-three...

245
00:33:07,167 --> 00:33:08,708
...forty-four...

246
00:33:11,125 --> 00:33:12,792
. forty-five...

247
00:33:14,542 --> 00:33:16,125
. forty-six...

248
00:33:17,125 --> 00:33:18,542
..forty-seven.

249
00:33:19,542 --> 00:33:22,875
-Perishables?
-Food that doesn't last very long.

250
00:33:23,083 --> 00:33:25,792
You put them in here
and they stay as they are.

251
00:33:26,833 --> 00:33:29,667
-They don't grow old?
-Exactly.

252
00:33:31,875 --> 00:33:33,333
Like The Land of Youth?

253
00:33:34,958 --> 00:33:37,083
Like The Land of Youth!

254
00:33:52,208 --> 00:33:54,167
You're getting the hang of it.

255
00:33:56,875 --> 00:33:58,625
Careful of your hand.

256
00:34:01,958 --> 00:34:03,583
Excuse me.

257
00:34:13,292 --> 00:34:15,792
Hello? 72599...

258
00:34:22,208 --> 00:34:23,708
Ninety-four...

259
00:34:25,167 --> 00:34:26,875
..ninety-five...

260
00:34:27,958 --> 00:34:29,417
..ninety-six...

261
00:34:30,958 --> 00:34:32,333
..ninety-seven...

262
00:34:33,333 --> 00:34:34,417
..ninety-eight...

263
00:34:36,208 --> 00:34:37,708
..ninety-nine...

264
00:34:42,125 --> 00:34:43,792
..one hundred.

265
00:34:49,708 --> 00:34:51,917
Your complexion is better already.

266
00:34:54,542 --> 00:34:57,792
All you needed was some minding.

267
00:35:18,458 --> 00:35:22,083
This game is crooked, girl.
I've been saying it for years.

268
00:35:22,292 --> 00:35:24,458
Quiet, you!

269
00:35:24,667 --> 00:35:27,042
Easy knowing whose purse
is running low!

270
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:28,833
Is it any wonder?

271
00:35:29,042 --> 00:35:32,458
After twenty years
of being swindled by you lot!

272
00:35:32,667 --> 00:35:35,208
O Cathasaigh,
haven't I said it before,

273
00:35:35,417 --> 00:35:37,667
misfortune followed you
from the cradle!

274
00:35:37,875 --> 00:35:40,333
Did your mother never tell you?

275
00:35:41,917 --> 00:35:45,958
"The Ass" O Cathasaigh.
The name well-earned.

276
00:35:46,125 --> 00:35:51,167
This girl must think that everyone
around here is mad, does she?

277
00:35:53,833 --> 00:35:57,292
-Who's winning? "The Ass" I bet.
-Who else?

278
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:00,083
And pigs might fly!

279
00:36:01,083 --> 00:36:03,583
You're after our pennies, are you?

280
00:36:03,792 --> 00:36:05,583
Selling tickets for the raffle.

281
00:36:05,792 --> 00:36:08,083
There's a new roof
going on the school.

282
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:10,208
I wasn't sure...

283
00:36:10,417 --> 00:36:12,750
You don't have to have
children of your own

284
00:36:12,958 --> 00:36:16,083
to give shelter
to other people's children, do you?

285
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:18,875
-You'll have a drink?
-I'll have a cup of tea.

286
00:36:19,625 --> 00:36:21,042
I'll get it.

287
00:36:28,833 --> 00:36:30,625
And who is this?

288
00:36:47,708 --> 00:36:49,292
Excuse me.

289
00:36:54,083 --> 00:36:56,583
Hello? 72599...

290
00:36:57,958 --> 00:37:00,125
Ah, hello Sinéad.

291
00:37:01,958 --> 00:37:05,292
You don't say! Your poor father!

292
00:37:09,458 --> 00:37:11,708
Of course, I'll head over to you now.

293
00:37:18,875 --> 00:37:22,958
There's ham and coleslaw in
the fridge for lunch if I'm not back.

294
00:37:23,167 --> 00:37:26,125
We won't die of the hunger anyway.

295
00:37:31,042 --> 00:37:34,667
My mam says I'll get pneumonia
if I don't wear my jumper.

296
00:37:34,875 --> 00:37:36,208
Now.

297
00:37:37,167 --> 00:37:39,792
Maybe the old man
wasn't wearing his jumper.

298
00:37:39,958 --> 00:37:41,250
Maybe.

299
00:37:42,792 --> 00:37:45,375
Why is Mrs Kinsella
looking after him?

300
00:37:46,875 --> 00:37:49,458
She's helping his daughter.

301
00:37:49,667 --> 00:37:52,125
It's the daughter
who's looking after him.

302
00:37:55,625 --> 00:37:58,417
Don't you help your neighbours out
now and then?

303
00:37:59,458 --> 00:38:01,083
I don't know.

304
00:39:32,958 --> 00:39:34,333
Cait!

305
00:39:42,167 --> 00:39:43,458
Cait!

306
00:39:44,958 --> 00:39:46,167
Cait!

307
00:39:57,583 --> 00:40:00,792
You can't go wandering off like that,
do you hear me?

308
00:40:02,083 --> 00:40:03,792
Do you hear me?

309
00:40:27,792 --> 00:40:29,167
Sean.

310
00:40:30,292 --> 00:40:32,833
Cait is going to bed.

311
00:40:33,042 --> 00:40:34,417
Good night.

312
00:41:56,917 --> 00:41:59,083
How are you getting on, love?

313
00:42:53,792 --> 00:42:56,250
-Is that the mother's milk?
-No.

314
00:42:57,583 --> 00:42:59,875
-What is it then?
-Powdered milk.

315
00:43:00,917 --> 00:43:03,667
Why don't you give him
his mother's milk?

316
00:43:03,875 --> 00:43:05,667
We sell that milk.

317
00:43:07,833 --> 00:43:12,042
-Why doesn't the calf get any?
-He does, in the beginning.

318
00:43:12,208 --> 00:43:13,833
For how long?

319
00:43:15,125 --> 00:43:16,708
Long enough!

320
00:43:18,042 --> 00:43:20,292
Why don't we drink the powdered milk

321
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,917
and leave the cows
to drink their own?

322
00:43:23,083 --> 00:43:25,292
Here, you do it.

323
00:44:13,667 --> 00:44:16,167
-Can you run?
-What?

324
00:44:16,375 --> 00:44:18,750
You have long legs.
Are you fast?

325
00:44:18,958 --> 00:44:20,333
Sometimes.

326
00:44:20,542 --> 00:44:23,500
Run down the lane
to the box and back.

327
00:44:23,708 --> 00:44:25,708
-What box?
-The post box.

328
00:44:25,917 --> 00:44:29,167
I forgot it this morning.
See if there's anything in it.

329
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:32,042
Off you go. I'll time you.

330
00:44:34,958 --> 00:44:36,458
Off you go!

331
00:46:04,792 --> 00:46:07,375
You've never had red gooseberry jam?

332
00:46:07,958 --> 00:46:09,750
I haven't.

333
00:46:09,958 --> 00:46:11,917
You're in for a treat so.

334
00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:29,667
Good girl.

335
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:37,333
It's past time
we did something about this.

336
00:46:43,208 --> 00:46:44,917
What's wrong with her?

337
00:46:45,083 --> 00:46:49,292
Tomorrow is Sunday and I won't let
her go to Mass like that again.

338
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:52,292
Isn't she clean and neat?

339
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:54,917
You know what I'm talking about,
Eibhlin.

340
00:46:59,708 --> 00:47:03,625
Run upstairs, get yourself ready
and I'll bring us into town.

341
00:47:40,083 --> 00:47:43,083
You should wash your hands and face
before going into town.

342
00:47:43,833 --> 00:47:46,917
Didn't your father bother
to teach you that much even?

343
00:48:01,958 --> 00:48:03,333
One minute.

344
00:48:17,083 --> 00:48:19,708
Sorry to have kept you.

345
00:48:23,125 --> 00:48:26,167
It will be nice
to have your own clothes.

346
00:48:28,333 --> 00:48:30,208
And the town is nice.

347
00:48:31,958 --> 00:48:36,250
I don't know why I didn't think
of taking you in before now.

348
00:48:52,708 --> 00:48:55,083
You can buy a Choc Ice for yourself.

349
00:48:57,875 --> 00:49:01,292
She could buy
half a dozen Choc Ices with that.

350
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:04,583
What good is it having her here
if we can't spoil her?

351
00:49:05,958 --> 00:49:07,792
What do you say?

352
00:49:07,958 --> 00:49:10,167
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

353
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:13,917
We'll go.

354
00:49:34,714 --> 00:49:36,284
Isn't she tall!

355
00:49:36,793 --> 00:49:38,211
We're all tall.

356
00:49:38,651 --> 00:49:41,371
You look beautiful, pet! Beautiful!

357
00:49:42,708 --> 00:49:43,974
Try this one.

358
00:49:45,338 --> 00:49:47,165
Isn't your mammy good to you?

359
00:49:52,042 --> 00:49:54,042
Nine pounds, ten ounces.

360
00:49:54,208 --> 00:49:57,125
-She was big in the end.
-You can say that again!

361
00:49:57,333 --> 00:50:00,458
She's beautiful.
Your mother must be mad about her.

362
00:50:00,667 --> 00:50:02,750
She's very taken with her.

363
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:06,167
What about Cian?
Is he good with her?

364
00:50:07,208 --> 00:50:09,333
He's getting used to her!

365
00:50:10,958 --> 00:50:13,042
It takes time, I suppose.

366
00:50:18,250 --> 00:50:20,417
And who's this girl? Whose is she?

367
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:24,583
This is Cait.
She's my cousin's daughter.

368
00:50:24,792 --> 00:50:26,833
She's staying with us for the summer.

369
00:50:28,083 --> 00:50:29,958
Can she be put to work?

370
00:50:31,667 --> 00:50:34,625
She'll put her hand to anything.

371
00:50:34,833 --> 00:50:38,833
Well, isn't she company for you
all the same, God help you.

372
00:50:59,667 --> 00:51:02,042
Sinéad, is everything OK?

373
00:51:03,042 --> 00:51:05,250
It's Dad, he's gone.

374
00:51:06,250 --> 00:51:08,500
Oh Sinéad, I'm so sorry.

375
00:51:11,542 --> 00:51:15,083
Very sorry for your loss, Sinéad.
If there's anything we can do.

376
00:51:26,417 --> 00:51:28,667
-Where's he gone?
-Sean?

377
00:51:30,125 --> 00:51:32,292
He's helping the family.

378
00:51:33,458 --> 00:51:35,458
Were you ever at a wake?

379
00:51:36,625 --> 00:51:38,458
I don't think so.

380
00:51:38,708 --> 00:51:41,625
Well, there will be a dead man
in a coffin.

381
00:51:41,833 --> 00:51:44,792
You probably never saw
a dead person before, did you?

382
00:51:45,792 --> 00:51:48,333
I did, on the news.

383
00:51:50,042 --> 00:51:53,250
You probably did, God help you.

384
00:51:53,458 --> 00:51:57,875
But it's a different thing
having them there in front of you.

385
00:52:11,833 --> 00:52:13,458
Don't be afraid.

386
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:35,917
He's praying.

387
00:52:37,083 --> 00:52:39,500
We have to say a prayer for him too.

388
00:52:40,833 --> 00:52:43,125
Bye for now, Sean.

389
00:52:45,208 --> 00:52:49,250
-There she is, the long-legged girl.
-Eibhlin, love!

390
00:52:51,167 --> 00:52:52,583
Come here.

391
00:52:55,958 --> 00:52:59,083
Isn't that a lovely dress?

392
00:52:59,292 --> 00:53:01,083
You got that today, did you?

393
00:53:03,792 --> 00:53:05,583
Do you want a sip?

394
00:53:17,458 --> 00:53:19,542
-Do you like it?
-No.

395
00:53:20,792 --> 00:53:25,667
Don't get a taste for it either or
you'll end up like these drunkards.

396
00:53:34,458 --> 00:53:35,792
Now.

397
00:53:49,083 --> 00:53:52,042
She's getting restless,
the poor creature.

398
00:53:53,708 --> 00:53:56,875
I can bring her home with me
if you'd like?

399
00:53:57,083 --> 00:53:58,833
I'll be leaving now.

400
00:53:59,167 --> 00:54:01,083
Oh, I don't know.

401
00:54:03,042 --> 00:54:05,125
My gang can play with her.

402
00:54:09,750 --> 00:54:12,292
Maybe. What harm?

403
00:54:13,292 --> 00:54:15,625
-If you don't mind.
-It's nothing.

404
00:54:19,875 --> 00:54:22,500
They're looking after you well,
I suppose.

405
00:54:22,708 --> 00:54:24,083
Yes.

406
00:54:24,292 --> 00:54:26,833
Tell me,
what room did they put you in?

407
00:54:27,958 --> 00:54:29,958
The one beside the toilet.

408
00:54:31,083 --> 00:54:33,667
Does he give you pocket money?
Kinsella?

409
00:54:34,667 --> 00:54:38,583
-He gave me money today.
-Weren't you lucky?

410
00:54:39,208 --> 00:54:41,167
-How much?
-A pound.

411
00:54:43,542 --> 00:54:45,792
Is herself allowed to spend?

412
00:54:46,792 --> 00:54:49,250
-Who?
-Eibhlin, you dope!

413
00:54:49,458 --> 00:54:51,417
She is.

414
00:54:51,625 --> 00:54:53,833
And she's still drinking, I suppose?

415
00:54:54,833 --> 00:54:56,875
When visitors come.

416
00:54:57,083 --> 00:55:02,125
-Do they have many visitors?
-They had a card game last week.

417
00:55:02,333 --> 00:55:04,083
Who was there?

418
00:55:04,250 --> 00:55:07,375
Two men. And another man
who came selling lines.

419
00:55:07,583 --> 00:55:10,250
-Lines?
-To put a roof on the school.

420
00:55:11,542 --> 00:55:13,625
Do you say the Rosary?

421
00:55:13,833 --> 00:55:15,542
No.

422
00:55:15,750 --> 00:55:19,792
-She's baking the whole time, is she?
-She is.

423
00:55:19,958 --> 00:55:22,417
-Butter or margarine?
-What?

424
00:55:22,625 --> 00:55:25,750
-In her pastry!
-Butter.

425
00:55:27,333 --> 00:55:30,625
Does she have the freezer
packed to the brim?

426
00:55:30,833 --> 00:55:32,458
Yes.

427
00:55:32,667 --> 00:55:35,583
-Where does the dog sleep?
-In the shed.

428
00:55:35,792 --> 00:55:38,667
-Not in the house?
-I've never seen him there.

429
00:55:39,667 --> 00:55:43,458
And are the child's clothes
still hanging in the wardrobe?

430
00:55:44,958 --> 00:55:48,167
-The child's clothes?
-Yes.

431
00:55:48,375 --> 00:55:52,458
If you're sleeping in his room,
you must know.

432
00:55:52,667 --> 00:55:54,958
Didn't you look?

433
00:55:55,125 --> 00:55:58,167
Well, she had clothes for me

434
00:55:58,417 --> 00:56:02,542
but we went into town
and bought new ones.

435
00:56:03,833 --> 00:56:07,542
-This rig-out you're wearing?
-I like them.

436
00:56:07,750 --> 00:56:10,292
The shop lady
said they were flattering.

437
00:56:11,958 --> 00:56:13,750
'Flattering', is it?

438
00:56:13,958 --> 00:56:15,333
Well..!

439
00:56:16,333 --> 00:56:20,750
Well, I suppose, after wearing the
dead's clothes for the past month.

440
00:56:25,292 --> 00:56:26,958
You didn't know?

441
00:56:27,958 --> 00:56:29,458
About what?

442
00:56:30,458 --> 00:56:32,833
The Kinsellas' boy, you dope.

443
00:56:36,958 --> 00:56:40,208
It must have been some
head of cabbage they found you under.

444
00:56:43,292 --> 00:56:45,083
What happened to him?

445
00:56:46,083 --> 00:56:49,583
Didn't he follow the dog
into the slurry pit...

446
00:56:50,750 --> 00:56:52,833
..and didn't he drown, the poor boy.

447
00:56:54,208 --> 00:56:56,083
That's what they say anyway.

448
00:56:57,875 --> 00:57:00,250
They say Sean got the gun

449
00:57:00,458 --> 00:57:04,083
and took the dog down the field
to kill it...

450
00:57:05,083 --> 00:57:09,167
..but he hadn't the heart
to shoot it, the soft-hearted fool.

451
00:57:11,333 --> 00:57:17,333
Do you know poor Eibhlin's hair
turned white overnight afterwards?

452
00:57:18,458 --> 00:57:21,792
-But her hair is brown.
-Brown?!

453
00:57:23,542 --> 00:57:25,458
Out of the dye-pot,

454
00:57:25,667 --> 00:57:27,083
you can be sure!

455
00:57:52,958 --> 00:57:54,417
There weren't many there.

456
00:57:54,667 --> 00:57:58,792
A mound of sandwiches still
on the table when I was leaving.

457
00:58:00,125 --> 00:58:01,958
They had raisin scones

458
00:58:02,167 --> 00:58:04,792
and some sort
of an attempt at a trifle.

459
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:09,875
And poor Gearéid
lying crooked in the coffin

460
00:58:10,083 --> 00:58:13,042
without a proper shave even.

461
00:58:13,208 --> 00:58:14,917
Shameful!

462
00:58:15,083 --> 00:58:17,667
And plastic rosary beads
in his hands,

463
00:58:17,875 --> 00:58:20,083
the poor wretch.

464
00:58:22,083 --> 00:58:26,250
Shut your traps in there!
I'm trying to talk to your granny!

465
00:58:36,208 --> 00:58:39,208
-Hello all.
-Sean, you were quick.

466
00:58:39,417 --> 00:58:43,625
We're only in the door.
Aren't we, girl?

467
00:58:44,625 --> 00:58:47,750
Thank you, Una.
It was good of you to take her home.

468
00:58:48,958 --> 00:58:51,917
A quiet girl, this one.

469
00:58:52,083 --> 00:58:54,292
She says as much as she needs to say.

470
00:58:55,708 --> 00:58:59,042
May there be many like her.
Are you ready, pet?

471
00:59:23,083 --> 00:59:25,750
Were you OK in there?

472
00:59:25,958 --> 00:59:26,958
Yes.

473
00:59:29,833 --> 00:59:31,958
Did she ask you any questions?

474
00:59:33,833 --> 00:59:36,042
A few things, not much.

475
00:59:39,750 --> 00:59:41,500
What did she ask you?

476
00:59:43,417 --> 00:59:47,667
She asked me if you used
butter or margarine in your pastry.

477
00:59:53,417 --> 00:59:55,250
Did she ask you anything else?

478
01:00:07,083 --> 01:00:08,875
What did she tell you?

479
01:00:12,083 --> 01:00:13,458
Girl.

480
01:00:15,083 --> 01:00:18,583
She told me that you had a little boy

481
01:00:18,792 --> 01:00:21,083
who followed the dog
into the slurry pit...

482
01:00:22,083 --> 01:00:23,708
..and died.

483
01:00:29,875 --> 01:00:34,083
And that I was wearing his clothes
for the past month.

484
01:01:52,792 --> 01:01:54,875
We'll go out.

485
01:02:34,833 --> 01:02:36,833
Someone's horse is missing tonight.

486
01:02:40,250 --> 01:02:42,458
It's a stable door.

487
01:02:52,333 --> 01:02:56,458
Do you know, fishermen sometimes
find horses out at sea?

488
01:02:59,667 --> 01:03:01,833
I know a man

489
01:03:02,042 --> 01:03:04,083
who towed a colt in one time.

490
01:03:06,958 --> 01:03:10,167
And the horse lay on the strand

491
01:03:10,375 --> 01:03:13,500
for a long, long time...

492
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:16,708
.like he was fit to die.

493
01:03:18,333 --> 01:03:22,042
Until he suddenly stood up, revived.

494
01:03:25,125 --> 01:03:27,083
He was OK?

495
01:03:27,250 --> 01:03:29,458
Good as new.

496
01:03:29,667 --> 01:03:31,083
Perfect.

497
01:03:40,208 --> 01:03:42,917
Strange things happen sometimes,
don't they?

498
01:03:49,417 --> 01:03:52,417
Something strange
happened to you tonight.

499
01:03:55,625 --> 01:03:58,417
But Eibhlin didn't mean any harm.

500
01:04:03,083 --> 01:04:06,125
She wants to find
the good in other people...

501
01:04:07,458 --> 01:04:09,750
..hoping she won't be disappointed...

502
01:04:12,625 --> 01:04:14,792
..but sometimes she is.

503
01:04:27,250 --> 01:04:29,833
You don't have to say anything.

504
01:04:33,208 --> 01:04:34,958
Always remember that.

505
01:04:37,958 --> 01:04:40,917
Many's the person missed
the opportunity to say nothing...

506
01:04:42,083 --> 01:04:44,500
..and lost much because of it.

507
01:05:14,583 --> 01:05:15,708
Cait?

508
01:05:32,083 --> 01:05:33,458
Look!

509
01:05:39,625 --> 01:05:41,417
There are three lights now.

510
01:06:51,523 --> 01:06:58,041
"Heidi," - she answered in a clear, ringing voice.

511
01:07:00,044 --> 01:07:01,438
"That's no Ch..."

512
01:07:02,930 --> 01:07:03,995
Christian.

513
01:07:05,119 --> 01:07:06,184
"...Christian..."

514
01:07:05,583 --> 01:07:08,083
Keep your finger under the words.

515
01:07:09,101 --> 01:07:12,467
"...Christian name for a child."

516
01:07:15,417 --> 01:07:17,500
I'm coming!

517
01:07:19,625 --> 01:07:21,208
I'm going to win!

518
01:08:04,628 --> 01:08:05,888
"And now open!

519
01:08:05,972 --> 01:08:09,625
After extensive renovation,
broad department store "Don Garben"

520
01:08:10,309 --> 01:08:11,826
is back in business!

521
01:08:11,878 --> 01:08:13,711
Except all for your home needs,

522
01:08:13,795 --> 01:08:17,023
we're also the one-stop shop
for the latest fabrics and fashions.

523
01:08:17,107 --> 01:08:19,489
And with Back-to-School Time
just around the corner

524
01:08:19,550 --> 01:08:21,641
we've got you covered for school uniforms,

525
01:08:21,724 --> 01:08:24,218
lunch boxes, copybooks, mathematical sets

526
01:08:24,302 --> 01:08:27,829
and a wide range of pencil cases
and colouring pencils!

527
01:08:27,913 --> 01:08:30,083
Professional service and easy marking.

528
01:08:30,166 --> 01:08:31,926
Look no further, dear housewives...

529
01:09:28,833 --> 01:09:32,458
Ten seconds faster
than the first time you did that.

530
01:09:32,667 --> 01:09:34,958
Like a gust of wind you are, girl.

531
01:09:36,208 --> 01:09:40,292
Now, do you think there's any money
in any of these?

532
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:42,208
I don't know.

533
01:09:43,208 --> 01:09:45,042
A wedding invite maybe.

534
01:09:47,750 --> 01:09:50,167
Will you marry someday, do you think?

535
01:09:51,208 --> 01:09:53,750
Mam says men
aren't worth bothering with.

536
01:09:55,125 --> 01:09:57,292
Maybe she's right.

537
01:09:57,500 --> 01:10:00,208
That being said,
we're not all the same.

538
01:10:01,208 --> 01:10:05,958
But this is certain, whatever fella's
to catch you, he'll have to be fast.

539
01:10:15,958 --> 01:10:17,333
My mam?

540
01:10:21,292 --> 01:10:23,333
It's addressed to Eibhlin.

541
01:10:30,083 --> 01:10:32,958
Well, you have a new brother.

542
01:10:33,667 --> 01:10:35,875
Eight pounds, six ounces.

543
01:10:36,875 --> 01:10:39,458
-Great.
-Don't be like that.

544
01:10:43,958 --> 01:10:46,625
And school is starting again
on Monday.

545
01:10:48,208 --> 01:10:50,958
Your mam wants us to bring you home

546
01:10:51,125 --> 01:10:54,083
so she can get you ready.

547
01:10:55,375 --> 01:10:57,250
I have to go back then?

548
01:11:00,083 --> 01:11:01,625
Yes.

549
01:11:01,833 --> 01:11:04,958
But you knew that, didn't you?

550
01:11:10,042 --> 01:11:15,958
You couldn't stay here
with old fogies like us, could you?

551
01:11:26,292 --> 01:11:28,083
Come here, child.

552
01:11:28,584 --> 01:11:30,352
I have not being in a hurry.

553
01:11:30,436 --> 01:11:32,877
This quilt has taken some years.

554
01:11:32,971 --> 01:11:35,251
It is already promised to a daughter.

555
01:11:33,083 --> 01:11:35,458
It'll be alright, love.

556
01:11:35,514 --> 01:11:38,455
And I hope will become a family heirloom.

557
01:13:14,750 --> 01:13:17,458
-You'll have a glass of orange, pet?
-Please.

558
01:13:22,708 --> 01:13:24,083
The water is low.

559
01:13:24,292 --> 01:13:27,042
I'll have to go down to the well
when you're gone.

560
01:13:39,667 --> 01:13:42,958
-Where's himself?
-He's milking the cows below.

561
01:13:53,333 --> 01:13:56,375
-What hurry is on himself?
-He needs help pulling a calf.

562
01:13:56,583 --> 01:13:59,458
Do you mind finishing down below?
I have the herd out.

563
01:13:59,667 --> 01:14:01,667
-Of course.
-I'll be back as soon as I can.

564
01:14:01,875 --> 01:14:03,250
Go.

565
01:14:16,042 --> 01:14:17,833
I won't be long, dear.

566
01:16:19,208 --> 01:16:20,625
Cait?

567
01:16:50,750 --> 01:16:52,250
Oh Christ!

568
01:16:54,667 --> 01:16:56,250
Oh, my love!

569
01:17:01,708 --> 01:17:03,125
You're frozen.

570
01:17:08,667 --> 01:17:13,042
-What will we say to her mother?
-We won't say a word to her mother.

571
01:17:13,208 --> 01:17:16,958
-It's just a little cold she has.
-She's expecting her at home.

572
01:17:17,167 --> 01:17:20,083
What harm if we hang on to her
for another day or two?

573
01:17:21,250 --> 01:17:23,458
When I think
of what could have happened.

574
01:17:23,667 --> 01:17:26,792
If you've said that once,
you've said it a hundred times!

575
01:17:26,958 --> 01:17:31,125
-But..!
-But nothing happened, she's fine.

576
01:17:32,667 --> 01:17:36,708
We'll bring her home at the weekend
and that's the end of it.

577
01:17:44,375 --> 01:17:47,500
I don't know if I had those potatoes
boiled right at all.

578
01:17:50,542 --> 01:17:52,583
I wouldn't find any fault with them.

579
01:19:36,292 --> 01:19:39,833
That's where Dad lost our red heifer
in a game of cards.

580
01:19:41,417 --> 01:19:43,042
You don't say?

581
01:19:46,417 --> 01:19:48,375
Wasn't that some wager?

582
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:54,500
Mam didn't speak to him
for a month afterwards.

583
01:21:40,625 --> 01:21:42,167
You've grown.

584
01:21:43,292 --> 01:21:44,708
I have.

585
01:21:45,708 --> 01:21:47,500
Now, watch that.

586
01:21:47,708 --> 01:21:49,708
Eibhlin.

587
01:21:49,917 --> 01:21:51,750
-Sean.
-Maire, my love.

588
01:21:51,958 --> 01:21:55,083
-How are you?
-It's a long time since I saw you.

589
01:21:55,292 --> 01:21:59,917
Come in and have a seat
if you can find a chair.

590
01:22:00,083 --> 01:22:02,333
-You'll have a cup of tea?
-We will.

591
01:22:16,625 --> 01:22:20,292
I brought some jam. Don't let me
leave without giving it to you.

592
01:22:20,500 --> 01:22:23,917
I made this from the rhubarb
you sent down to me.

593
01:22:24,083 --> 01:22:25,833
That's the last of it.

594
01:22:26,042 --> 01:22:29,708
I should have brought more rhubarb
with me, I wasn't thinking.

595
01:22:36,875 --> 01:22:38,750
Where's the new baby?

596
01:22:38,958 --> 01:22:42,708
He's up in the room.
You'll hear him soon enough.

597
01:22:46,958 --> 01:22:49,292
How is he sleeping?

598
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:52,083
He could crow at any hour.

599
01:22:52,833 --> 01:22:54,333
You never know.

600
01:23:00,583 --> 01:23:03,583
Speak of the angels
and you'll hear their wings.

601
01:23:31,292 --> 01:23:32,708
Hello, girls.

602
01:23:50,333 --> 01:23:52,833
He's sturdy, isn't he?

603
01:23:53,042 --> 01:23:54,667
He's a pet!

604
01:24:05,583 --> 01:24:07,042
No sign of himself?

605
01:24:08,708 --> 01:24:10,958
He went out earlier.

606
01:24:11,125 --> 01:24:12,792
Wherever he's gone.

607
01:24:23,458 --> 01:24:24,875
Speak of the angels.

608
01:24:37,219 --> 01:24:38,666
- Evening, all.
- Dan.

609
01:24:41,694 --> 01:24:43,947
There's the prodigal child. Huh?

610
01:24:44,891 --> 01:24:46,571
Coming back to us, did you?

611
01:24:47,508 --> 01:24:48,508
I did.

612
01:24:52,598 --> 01:24:54,938
- Did she give you any trouble?
- Trouble?

613
01:24:55,738 --> 01:24:57,751
Good as gold, she was, the same girl.

614
01:24:58,975 --> 01:25:00,143
Is that so?

615
01:25:01,462 --> 01:25:03,142
Well, isn't that a relief?

616
01:25:04,997 --> 01:25:07,527
You'll want to sit in
and have your supper.

617
01:25:09,527 --> 01:25:10,939
I had liquid supper.

618
01:25:11,958 --> 01:25:13,958
Any news from home?

619
01:25:15,500 --> 01:25:16,917
Not much.

620
01:25:18,083 --> 01:25:20,250
All quiet really.

621
01:25:25,583 --> 01:25:29,042
-Have you caught a cold?
-No.

622
01:25:30,042 --> 01:25:31,750
You haven't?

623
01:25:32,750 --> 01:25:34,750
Nothing happened.

624
01:25:36,542 --> 01:25:38,417
What does that mean?

625
01:25:39,417 --> 01:25:40,958
I haven't caught a cold.

626
01:25:41,583 --> 01:25:43,958
The poor girl was in bed
for a few days.

627
01:25:44,060 --> 01:25:45,873
Didn't she catch herself a wee chill.

628
01:25:46,181 --> 01:25:47,181
Aye.

629
01:25:47,609 --> 01:25:49,233
She couldn't mind them.

630
01:25:49,855 --> 01:25:51,126
You know yourself.

631
01:25:52,401 --> 01:25:53,401
Dan.

632
01:25:59,762 --> 01:26:02,308
You know, I think it's getting to us time
that we were making tracks.

633
01:26:02,392 --> 01:26:03,444
It's a long road.

634
01:26:03,875 --> 01:26:07,750
-What hurry is on you?
-No hurry, the usual.

635
01:26:07,958 --> 01:26:10,083
The cows don't give you any let up.

636
01:26:15,662 --> 01:26:16,595
Jesus!

637
01:26:17,997 --> 01:26:20,251
That’s a right dose
you came home with, huh?

638
01:26:20,538 --> 01:26:22,507
It’s nothing she hasn’t caught before

639
01:26:22,843 --> 01:26:24,325
and won’t catch again.

640
01:26:24,571 --> 01:26:26,049
Sure, isn’t it going around?

641
01:26:26,125 --> 01:26:27,958
Are you ready for home?

642
01:26:38,083 --> 01:26:40,708
Are you sure everything is OK?

643
01:26:40,917 --> 01:26:42,542
Yes.

644
01:26:42,750 --> 01:26:45,667
These are nice and floury.
They're Queens.

645
01:26:46,958 --> 01:26:48,792
There was no need, Sean.

646
01:26:50,042 --> 01:26:52,792
It was a nice thing you did,
minding her.

647
01:26:54,167 --> 01:26:55,958
Thank you, both.

648
01:26:56,125 --> 01:27:01,542
She was welcome,
and is welcome again any time.

649
01:27:01,750 --> 01:27:03,667
She is a credit to you.

650
01:27:06,375 --> 01:27:08,125
Take care, my love.

651
01:27:20,833 --> 01:27:22,417
Goodbye, my love.

652
01:27:46,708 --> 01:27:48,500
What happened at all?

653
01:27:56,875 --> 01:27:58,292
Tell me.

654
01:29:46,691 --> 01:29:47,624
Daddy.

655
01:29:53,720 --> 01:29:54,834
Daddy.
