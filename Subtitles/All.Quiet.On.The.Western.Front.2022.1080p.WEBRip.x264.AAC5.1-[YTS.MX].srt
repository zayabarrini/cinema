For you!

24
00:42:28,791 --> 00:42:30,208
Liverwurst, love!

25
00:42:30,708 --> 00:42:31,875
Lots of love!

26
00:43:02,708 --> 00:43:05,541
Oh, my.
You are very beautiful, my love.

27
00:43:29,666 --> 00:43:31,041
Goodbye!

28

Goodbye, my friends!

29
00:55:00,666 --> 00:55:01,666
Hello, madam.

30
00:55:05,291 --> 00:55:06,291
I'm Kropp.

31
00:55:10,791 --> 00:55:11,708
And you?

32
00:55:24,083 --> 00:55:24,916
Do you want to…

33
00:55:29,333 --> 00:55:30,916
Do you want to come with me?

34
00:55:33,083 --> 00:55:33,916
Not a problem.

36
01:05:27,333 --> 01:05:29,250
Weygand,
what do these gentlemen want?

37
01:05:30,166 --> 01:05:31,666
I don't know.

38
01:06:10,708 --> 01:06:14,375
If you please,
we would like to know the conditions--

39
01:06:40,458 --> 01:06:43,041
We are asking for an armistice.

40
01:06:48,666 --> 01:06:50,791
You have 72 hours
to accept our conditions.

41
01:07:12,958 --> 01:07:13,958
Sign then.

42
01:22:12,916 --> 01:22:15,250
Retreat! Retreat!

43
01:27:18,625 --> 01:27:19,541
So sorry.

44
01:27:20,958 --> 01:27:22,041
So sorry.

45
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,208
I am so sorry. I am so sorry.

46
01:28:02,750 --> 01:28:05,291
DUVAL, GÉRARD
TYPOGRAPHER

47
01:28:19,916 --> 01:28:20,875

48
01:28:22,875 --> 01:28:24,000
Your wife…

49
01:28:25,625 --> 01:28:27,291
I promise… I promise…

50
01:28:28,708 --> 01:28:29,666
I promise…

51
01:32:36,166 --> 01:32:37,291
THE KAISER HAS ABDICATED

52
01:44:22,208 --> 01:44:23,125
Henri.

53
01:44:26,708 --> 01:44:27,833
Taste it.

54
01:44:31,833 --> 01:44:32,916
Were they made today?

55
01:44:35,916 --> 01:44:37,875
I'm sorry, sir. I don't think so.

56
01:45:10,875 --> 01:45:12,000
I'm listening.

57
01:45:30,833 --> 01:45:34,041
This is a disease
of the defeated, not of the victorious.

58
01:45:34,125 --> 01:45:35,500
I don't fear it.

59
01:45:35,583 --> 01:45:37,208
I reject any compromise.

60
01:45:45,583 --> 01:45:46,541
Fair?

61
01:45:49,875 --> 01:45:51,458
You speak of fairness?

62
01:46:05,625 --> 01:46:06,750
Sign it.

63
01:47:24,375 --> 01:47:25,666
Very good.

64
01:47:26,291 --> 01:47:27,416
The war is over.

65
01:53:18,208 --> 01:53:19,166
Look.

66
01:53:22,208 --> 01:53:23,541
It's really good.

67
01:53:26,916 --> 01:53:27,750
Want some?

68
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
Piece of garbage…

69
01:54:22,208 --> 01:54:23,208
Stop!

70
01:54:24,166 --> 01:54:25,291
Thief!

71
01:54:39,250 --> 01:54:40,250
Asshole!

72
01:54:45,958 --> 01:54:46,791
God damn!

73
01:54:48,041 --> 01:54:50,041
We'll kill them, these sons of bitches.

74
02:08:02,625 --> 02:08:04,000
It belonged to Lefèvre.

75
02:08:05,291 --> 02:08:07,083
Poor bastard, he saved it for the end.

76
02:08:07,791 --> 02:08:10,083
-He won't need it anymore.
-Thank you, sir.

77
02:08:14,375 --> 02:08:16,208
Here's to you and to Lefèvre.

78
02:08:22,541 --> 02:08:23,583
Well, it's good.

79
02:08:27,208 --> 02:08:28,208
The nightmare is over.

80
02:09:28,375 --> 02:09:31,333
Enemy attack! Enemy attack!

81
02:09:31,416 --> 02:09:33,083
-In position!
- In position!

82
02:09:35,666 --> 02:09:37,083
Fire!

83
02:09:37,958 --> 02:09:39,166
Fire!

84
02:10:26,791 --> 02:10:27,958
Charge!

85
02:13:16,625 --> 02:13:18,333
Cease fire!

86
02:13:18,416 --> 02:13:19,958
It is 11:00 a.m.!

87
02:16:02,708 --> 02:16:05,583
A light!
Bring me a light! A light please!

88
02:19:53,458 --> 02:19:57,041
Shortly after the start of hostilities
in October 1914,

89
02:19:57,125 --> 02:19:59,958
the Western Front
froze into positional warfare.

90
02:20:01,458 --> 02:20:07,750
By the end of the war in November 1918,
the front line had barely moved.

91
02:20:09,416 --> 02:20:12,125
More than three million soldiers
died here,

92
02:20:12,208 --> 02:20:15,791
often while fighting to gain
only a few hundred meters of ground.

93
02:20:17,375 --> 02:20:23,708
Almost 17 million people
lost their lives in the First World War.
