1
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:28,910
Tanaka-san!

2
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,910
Tanaka-san!

3
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:46,550
<i>A story like mine should never be told.</i>

4
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:52,850
<i>For my world is as
forbidden as it is fragile.</i>

5
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:58,600
<i>Without its mysteries, it cannot survive.</i>

6
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:05,480
<i>I certainly wasn't born
to the life of a geisha.</i>

7
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:11,950
<i>Like so much in my strange life I
was carried there by the current.</i>

8
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:19,990
<i>The first time I knew my mother was sick</i>

9
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:24,976
<i>was when my father threw
the fish back into the sea.</i>

10
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:28,540
<i>That night we went hungry.</i>

11
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:32,890
<i>"To understand emptiness", he told us.</i>

12
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:39,930
<i>Mother always said my
sister Satsu was like wood.</i>

13
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:43,930
<i>As rooted to the earth as a sakura tree.</i>

14
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:47,440
<i>But she told me I was like water.</i>

15
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:52,190
<i>Water can carve its
way, even through stone.</i>

16
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:57,620
<i>And when trapped, water makes a new path.</i>

17
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:28,730
Stop here.

18
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,640
These are the girls from Tanaka?

19
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:06,150
Sisters, yes, from Yoroido.

20
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,520
This one, maybe. The other one, no.

21
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:15,520
-No, no, Chiyo! Chiyo! Chiyo!
-Satsu! Satsu!

22
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:18,410
-Chiyo!
-Satsu!

23
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:32,670
Show your respect for Mother.

24
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:36,696
You must not speak. I will answer for you.

25
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,930
Kneel.

26
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:51,956
And head down. Never look her in the face.

27
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:12,130
-How old are you?
-She is Year of the Rooster.

28
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:17,050
Only 9.

29
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:39,660
Where is my sister?

30
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:44,790
Let me see those eyes.

31
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:48,290
Look at me.

32
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,580
Too much water.

33
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:57,040
<i>But, Okasan, a little water
is good to guard against fire.</i>

34
00:07:57,130 --> 00:08:02,010
<i>You won't have to worry about the
okiya burning losing all your kimono.</i>

35
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,550
These country girls.

36
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:08,730
Too late to send her back now.

37
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,860
Go.

38
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:29,250
Pumpkin. Keep her quiet.
Mother is downstairs.

39
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:32,750
Let me go!

40
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,660
Let me go! Let me go! Let me go!

41
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:38,080
-Stop that.
-Let me go!

42
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:41,000
Mother will hear you.
She's got a bamboo stick.

43
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:44,970
I want my sister! Satsu!

44
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:55,730
I cried too at first.

45
00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:01,610
You know, it is easier if
you just forget everything

46
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:05,732
<i>that happened before
you came to the okiya.</i>

47
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:10,320
If you impress Mother
and do exactly as she says

48
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:14,370
she will send you to
school to be a geisha.

49
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,790
A what?

50
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:19,210
A geisha. Like Hatsumomo.

51
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:23,852
<i>You will get to drink
sake and sleep until noon.</i>

52
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:27,060
Where is my sister?

53
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:31,462
<i>Probably in another
okiya in the hanamachi.</i>

54
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:36,090
Your family sold you to this house.

55
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:39,530
You live here now.

56
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:57,590
Outside, you wear these.

57
00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:00,260
Inside, these.

58
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:06,640
We don't display our
naked feet like monkeys.

59
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:10,090
It's not flesh we're selling here.

60
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:12,640
This is a geisha house.

61
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,730
<i>Remember to always honor this okiya.</i>

62
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:22,350
You listen, you learn.

63
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,530
Now get to work.

64
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:30,330
Be quiet. Hatsumomo is sleeping.

65
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:36,740
Pumpkin, when can I go outside?

66
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:41,500
<i>Outside the okiya?
You can't. It's not allowed.</i>

67
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:43,920
How will I find Satsu?

68
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:48,630
<i>You can't just walk up to
every house in the hanamachi.</i>

69
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,696
Do you know how many there are?

70
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:55,730
Look.

71
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,720
Tighter!

72
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,110
Chiyo. Chiyo-chan.

73
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:01,330
Come. Two nights ago, Hatsumomo
had to stay at the teahouse until dawn.

74
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:05,460
That's what she told Mother. But she
was really here with a man the whole...

75
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:08,260
Why can't you be quiet?

76
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:17,600
So this is the new arrival.

77
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:44,340
A pity she still stinks of fish.

78
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:53,430
Stay out of my room.

79
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:56,170
Your fingers smell.

80
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:59,810
I can't have you touching my things.

81
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:19,740
Only reason Mother tolerates Hatsumomo
is because she brings in good money.

82
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:21,950
Never forget.

83
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:28,420
It is Hatsumomo who pays for
your supper the clothes on your back.

84
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:35,420
By the time she was 20 she had
already earned back her purchase price.

85
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:37,760
Unheard of.

86
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:42,390
<i>She has been the talk of
the hanamachi ever since.</i>

87
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,720
These are all hers?

88
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:49,150
<i>Certainly not. They belong to the okiya.</i>

89
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:58,150
A kimono like this, made of Tatsumura
silk it would take a lifetime to earn.

90
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:08,330
A geisha needs an elegant
wardrobe just like an artist needs ink.

91
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:13,590
If she's not properly dressed,
then she is not a true geisha.

92
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,920
Nobody told me what a geisha is.

93
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:18,590
You will find out soon enough.

94
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:21,090
I have news for you, child.

95
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:26,600
Mother has determined
it is off to school with you.

96
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:29,900
You are to become geisha.

97
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:38,580
Chiyo! Pumpkin!

98
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:43,540
Quick, quick! Don't be late!

99
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,030
You will be late.

100
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,880
Go. Go.

101
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:54,550
This way!

102
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,650
Pumpkin! Pumpkin!

103
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:19,030
Pumpkin! I'm going to run.
I'm going to find Satsu.

104
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,540
No, Chiyo-chan, don't!

105
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,910
You will ruin your own chances.
And mine too.

106
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,130
Please, stay with me.

107
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,470
Squid. Come on!

108
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:00,584
Look for your sister's name later.

109
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,920
You are late!

110
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:47,750
Chiyo! Where is Granny's food?

111
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,490
Where have you been?

112
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:54,960
It's freezing cold!

113
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:58,510
Close the window!

114
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:03,840
<i>With millions of people
unemployed, on the brink of starvation.</i>

115
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:09,430
<i>Banking institutions have continued to
suffer in Germany due to rapid inflation.</i>

116
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,760
<i>Another cause of Germany's
suffering is the constant struggle</i>

117
00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:19,490
<i>to pay the heavy burden of war reparations
it's still...</i> Chiyo! Chiyo, come quickly!

118
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:23,820
Hatsumomo is at the bathhouse. Tidy up.

119
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:30,120
<i>-But she told me to stay out...
-Hatsumomo does not run this okiya.</i>

120
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:36,834
<i>The Japanese emperor has agreed
to send army instructors to Manchuria.</i>

121
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:47,600
Why, look who's in my room.

122
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,830
Did you touch this?

123
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:17,700
I can just hear the General now.

124
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:22,040
"Why, Hatsumomo, you
used to smell of jasmine.

125
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:27,140
What's this new perfume? Blowfish?"

126
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:33,326
I told you never to touch my things.
Can't you understand why?

127
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:40,150
Because your General will
say, "Hatsumomo, you stink."

128
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:48,070
At least you don't smell
as bad as your sister.

129
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,820
You know, she was here.
She came by looking for you.

130
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:54,830
What?

131
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:58,330
Was I wrong to ask her to leave?

132
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:01,670
Please, tell me where she is.

133
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:09,084
Only if you swear yourself to me first.

134
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:12,720
Yes?

135
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,810
Now, get out.

136
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:43,790
Hatsumomo. You'll wake the entire house.

137
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:48,800
Your big sister is thirsty.
So am I. Go get us some beer.

138
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:51,380
I'm not in the mood for beer.

139
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:57,390
I know what you're in the
mood for, and his name is Koichi.

140
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:01,820
What did you say, Korin?

141
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,570
I'm sorry. I forgot.

142
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:15,466
You're just jealous someone cares for me.

143
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:20,330
Guess who this belongs to.

144
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:27,356
A geisha as desired as she is ought
to keep a close eye on her clothes.

145
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,300
-It's Mameha's?
-Yes.

146
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:33,942
-How did you get it?
-Bribed her maid.

147
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:46,060
-There.
-I can't.

148
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:47,900
Give it to her.

149
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:53,908
-Little Chiyo, come. Come.
-Chiyo.

150
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:02,288
Now, then, little Chiyo, it's
time to practice your calligraphy.

151
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,390
There.

152
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:20,600
Remember, you swore yourself to me.

153
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:23,020
Yes.

154
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:53,300
Don't let anybody see you.

155
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:00,520
Go, go!

156
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:06,478
This will teach the great Mameha.

157
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:10,030
Come, come.

158
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:34,510
Thieving rat!

159
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:39,300
That kimono was worth more than you!

160
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:42,930
Careful!
You will hurt yourself more than her!

161
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,900
Let me.

162
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,870
Kneel!

163
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:05,750
What have you done to Hatsumomo?

164
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,120
I haven't done anything. I promise you.

165
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:12,000
Her little trick with that
kimono will cost you.

166
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:18,170
Whatever you have done to anger
her, you'd be wise to stop now.

167
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:20,130
Lie facedown!

168
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:25,540
I will beat you hard, so Mother
does not beat you harder.

169
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:59,970
I told you not to let anybody see you.

170
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:03,760
I have kept my promise.

171
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:07,310
So tell me, where is she?

172
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:15,400
<i>She's in the next hanamachi
in the house called Tatsuyo.</i>

173
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:18,490
In the pleasure district.

174
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:23,660
Trust me, little Chiyo, you will find her.

175
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,370
Tatsuyo?

176
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,640
Satsu! Satsu!

177
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:21,270
Satsu!

178
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,610
Satsu from Yoroido! Satsu! Satsu!

179
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:30,950
No! Satsu! No! Satsu! Satsu!

180
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,320
Sat...

181
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:03,740
Satsu! Satsu!

182
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:06,070
Chiyo-chan!

183
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:11,134
-What took you so long?
-But, Satsu, I tried!

184
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:16,490
<i>I went to your okiya weeks ago.
They laughed and turned me away.</i>

185
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:19,200
Please, I did not know!

186
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:21,840
I've missed you so much!

187
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:25,710
Let's leave. Tonight.

188
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:30,010
But we need money, Chiyo. I know I
can steal some first thing tomorrow.

189
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:33,260
-No, please! Tonight!
-No, tomorrow!

190
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:38,110
Meet me at the Sasame
Bridge as soon as it's dark.

191
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:43,600
Now I have to go.
Quickly, before someone catches us.

192
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:45,730
What if I cannot get away?

193
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:48,280
Be there, Chiyo. It's our one chance.

194
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:50,320
Once I've left, I can't go back.

195
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:54,330
I've waited as long as I can. Now go!

196
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:47,000
What is she doing here? She's seen us.

197
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:50,670
Stupid girl. Why have you come back?

198
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:53,660
Your perfect chance to escape!

199
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,640
Get in!

200
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:59,890
-Koichi, please.
-Look at us.

201
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:02,680
Sneaking around like criminals.

202
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:05,810
-Koichi, don't...
-It's degrading.

203
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:08,110
What's going on?

204
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,990
Koichi.

205
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:12,950
Who's there?

206
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:18,290
Go! Now! Go!

207
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:27,920
Show your face.

208
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:34,630
<i>Look, Okasan! I caught her stealing!</i>

209
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:39,232
She was running away
with her sister, the whore!

210
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:42,220
You little thief!

211
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:44,140
No! She is lying!

212
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:48,520
-After all we have done for her!
-I saw her with a man! Right there!

213
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:50,230
His name is Koichi!

214
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:54,070
Shut up! We should kick her out!

215
00:29:57,790 --> 00:30:00,290
Take her arms.

216
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:24,520
You are never to see him again.

217
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:31,730
What do you think?
A geisha is free to love?

218
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:33,950
Never.

219
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,230
Bolt the gate!

220
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:39,830
<i>No one is leaving this okiya.</i>

221
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:09,620
Dr. Moro is very expensive.

222
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:14,540
You seem to be racking up quite a debt.

223
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:24,760
Kimono destroyed geisha school
rice and pickles, train ticket, Mr. Bekku.

224
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:30,100
All this on top of the
money I paid Mr. Tanaka.

225
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,850
And for what?

226
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:38,534
And now I hear that
your sister has run away.

227
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:44,520
She didn't wait for you.
And now she can never come back.

228
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:48,910
You must forget you ever had a sister.

229
00:34:57,090 --> 00:35:00,630
We are your only family now.

230
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:34,030
"Dear Satsu and little Chiyo;

231
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:40,870
As one who was once an orphan child myself
this humble person is sorry to inform you

232
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:45,670
that six weeks after you
left for your new life in Miyako

233
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:50,420
the suffering of your honored
mother came to its end."

234
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:53,700
And only a few weeks afterward your

235
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:57,720
honored father departed
this world as well.

236
00:35:57,810 --> 00:36:01,940
This humble person feels
confident both your honored parents

237
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:06,230
"have found their places in paradise.
But happily..."

238
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:13,500
<i>At the temple there is a poem
called "Loss" carved into the stone.</i>

239
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:16,070
<i>It has three words.</i>

240
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:19,670
<i>But the poet has scratched them out.</i>

241
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:22,660
<i>You cannot read "Loss."</i>

242
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:25,050
<i>Only feel it.</i>

243
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:30,420
<i>My father and mother had left this life.</i>

244
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:34,560
<i>My sister, I never heard of again.</i>

245
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:41,490
<i>I had dishonored the okiya, so
Mother had other plans for me.</i>

246
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:47,480
<i>I would pay back my debt
year after year after year.</i>

247
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:49,730
<i>Not as a geisha.</i>

248
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:52,700
<i>As her slave.</i>

249
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:09,430
It is too pretty a day to be so unhappy.

250
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:13,390
Did you fall down?

251
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:18,260
Why so shy?

252
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:23,918
Nothing to be ashamed of.
We all stumble from time to time.

253
00:37:24,730 --> 00:37:27,190
You see that enchanting lady in green?

254
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:33,280
<i>Once, when she was just a maiko,
she fell clean off her wooden shoes.</i>

255
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:35,150
It's true, I did.

256
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:38,160
And now look at her. So elegant.

257
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:41,700
Mr. Chairman, shouldn't we hurry?
We will miss the beginning.

258
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:47,358
We see the Spring Dances every year.
We can spare a moment.

259
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,220
What's your name?

260
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,660
Don't be afraid to look at me.

261
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:04,398
Do you like sweet plum or cherry?

262
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:07,690
You mean, to eat?

263
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:10,360
I like sweet plum myself.

264
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:12,320
Come.

265
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:19,070
None of us find as much
kindness in this life as we should.

266
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,620
Hi. Both kinds, please.

267
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:28,470
My children wait for these every spring.

268
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:47,810
Now I'm a geisha too.

269
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:50,350
And so you are.

270
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:54,376
How did you come by such surprising eyes?

271
00:38:55,490 --> 00:38:57,820
My mother gave them to me.

272
00:38:57,910 --> 00:39:00,240
Generous of her, wasn't it?

273
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:03,210
As you have been to me.

274
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:08,170
Smile for me, won't you?

275
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:12,510
There, now. That is your gift to me.

276
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:19,760
This will buy your supper.

277
00:39:19,850 --> 00:39:21,640
Now, promise me one thing:

278
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:26,150
Next time you take a tumble, no frowns.

279
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:29,650
That's better.

280
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:44,310
<i>In that moment I
changed from a girl facing</i>

281
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:48,580
<i>nothing but emptiness
to someone with purpose.</i>

282
00:39:50,210 --> 00:39:56,460
<i>I saw that to be a geisha could be
a stepping stone to something else:</i>

283
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:59,300
<i>A place in his world.</i>

284
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:33,670
<i>The money the Chairman had given me could
have bought fish and rice for a month.</i>

285
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:39,800
<i>But I gave it back in prayer
keeping only his handkerchief.</i>

286
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:49,270
<i>I asked one day to become a geisha.</i>

287
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:55,240
<i>And then, somehow, to meet him again.</i>

288
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:27,090
<i>The Imperial War Ministry announces news:</i>

289
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:30,720
<i>A great victory for
our friend Adolf Hitler.</i>

290
00:41:30,810 --> 00:41:35,730
<i>Today, Hitler demanded self-determination,
for Germans living in Austria.</i>

291
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:39,110
<i>Hitler's quest for
lebensraum, "living space"...</i>

292
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,900
Chiyo-chan, I can't find my comb!
Did you find it yet?

293
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:43,900
Pumpkin, it's time to go.

294
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:47,860
<i>-I found it.
-Arigato, Chiyo.</i>

295
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:52,620
Oh, I couldn't sleep last night, I
was so worried about my stupid hair.

296
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:54,750
Am I lopsided?

297
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:56,750
You look beautiful.

298
00:41:56,840 --> 00:42:02,630
With your hair like that you look
more like a pumpkin than ever.

299
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,760
Don't poke your neck
forward like a tortoise.

300
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:08,800
She's not ready? We will be late.

301
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:14,650
Poor Pumpkin. Her debut, and
everyone will be staring at you.

302
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:21,480
Hurry up, huh? This time tune
your shamisen before you play.

303
00:42:21,570 --> 00:42:26,530
When you make a fool of yourself,
your big sister gets the blame.

304
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:29,530
Stop crying, your face will run.

305
00:42:29,621 --> 00:42:31,711
Pumpkin!

306
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:01,860
Pumpkin!

307
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:46,680
<i>The winter I turned 15, I
saw the Chairman again.</i>

308
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:51,920
<i>But that wasn't the only surprise
fate brought me that season.</i>

309
00:44:52,010 --> 00:44:57,350
<i>Along with the snow came
a most unexpected visitor.</i>

310
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:05,900
Why is she here?

311
00:45:06,030 --> 00:45:08,690
Chiyo! Chiyo!

312
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:11,240
Open the gate!

313
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:41,310
<i>Now that your beloved Granny is
gone you'll have no need for a maid.</i>

314
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:46,490
I would never question the great Mameha,

315
00:45:47,070 --> 00:45:50,860
<i>but you could choose
anyone in the hanamachi.</i>

316
00:45:50,950 --> 00:45:53,110
You flatter me, truly.

317
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:57,780
I'd give you my Pumpkin if she
were not already tied to Hatsumomo.

318
00:45:57,870 --> 00:46:00,830
Please. I would never dream of asking.

319
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:06,870
Besides, I could always sell Chiyo to Mrs.
Tatsuyo.

320
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:10,040
With your eye for
beauty and nose for talent

321
00:46:10,130 --> 00:46:13,460
surely you can see what a
terrible waste that would be.

322
00:46:13,550 --> 00:46:19,050
If you were not the kind-hearted
geisha I know you to be

323
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:24,940
then I might think you were
scheming against Hatsumomo.

324
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:31,610
Then I'm grateful, Mrs. Nitta, that
you don't have a suspicious mind.

325
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:36,280
Perhaps you can pique my interest with...
Yes?

326
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:38,500
...your offer.

327
00:46:39,790 --> 00:46:46,040
I will cover Chiyo's schooling, all
her expenses till after her debut.

328
00:46:46,130 --> 00:46:50,250
Now I am confident you are teasing.

329
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:52,920
I could not be more sincere.

330
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:57,260
If Chiyo hasn't repaid her debt
within six months after her debut...

331
00:46:57,350 --> 00:47:00,260
Impossible! Too little time.

332
00:47:00,350 --> 00:47:02,350
Then I will pay you twice over.

333
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:04,400
What?

334
00:47:06,770 --> 00:47:14,690
No geisha could ever I am certain you
will not object to one trivial condition.

335
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:16,740
Yes?

336
00:47:16,830 --> 00:47:20,785
If Chiyo erases her
debt in the time allowed

337
00:47:20,875 --> 00:47:24,830
you will have no part
in her future earnings.

338
00:47:27,090 --> 00:47:31,380
It's too good to be true.
Mameha is up to something.

339
00:47:31,470 --> 00:47:35,300
She isn't in it for the money.
That much is for certain.

340
00:47:35,390 --> 00:47:38,328
<i>Rumor has it, ever
since the prime minister</i>

341
00:47:38,418 --> 00:47:40,930
<i>bought her mizuage she's been rich.</i>

342
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:46,010
That so?
Absurd to think she noticed Chiyo.

343
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:47,890
It's that kimono.

344
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:50,810
She remembers how you destroyed it.

345
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:55,440
-Now she wants to get even.
-An odd picture, isn't it?

346
00:47:55,530 --> 00:48:00,990
Hatsumomo sweeping into teahouse
after teahouse with our little Pumpkin.

347
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:04,080
And Mameha with our maid.

348
00:48:04,250 --> 00:48:07,580
I'm so far behind.
I will never catch up to you.

349
00:48:07,670 --> 00:48:09,720
Don't worry, Chiyo-chan. I will help you.

350
00:48:09,810 --> 00:48:11,820
Pumpkin!

351
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:21,170
You are never to speak to her again.

352
00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:23,390
Now you are rivals.

353
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:36,070
Pumpkin.

354
00:48:36,450 --> 00:48:38,570
Pumpkin.

355
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:49,540
<i>This is how it was, this
tiny world of women.</i>

356
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:52,800
<i>Friend turned against friend.</i>

357
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:57,630
<i>And now the two greatest
geisha in Miyako at war over me.</i>

358
00:48:57,720 --> 00:48:59,670
<i>Hatsumomo at my back.</i>

359
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:03,090
<i>Mameha calling, offering me the chance</i>

360
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:07,850
<i>to become one of those elegant
women I'd seen on the bridge</i>

361
00:49:07,940 --> 00:49:14,190
<i>floating in a silk kimono,
the Chairman at my side.</i>

362
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:18,280
Chiyo is my new protégée.

363
00:49:20,030 --> 00:49:23,030
As lovely as her big sister.

364
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:26,192
And with eyes the color of rain.

365
00:49:29,170 --> 00:49:33,410
<i>The Baron is a very special man to me.
My danna.</i>

366
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:38,972
Someday, if you are fortunate,
you will have a patron too.

367
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:44,652
Don't kneel.
You are not a servant girl anymore.

368
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:52,730
Step into the light.

369
00:49:57,110 --> 00:49:59,310
I see water in you.

370
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:01,440
Does that displease you?

371
00:50:01,530 --> 00:50:03,280
Water is powerful.

372
00:50:03,370 --> 00:50:08,280
It can wash away earth, put
out fire and even destroy iron.

373
00:50:08,370 --> 00:50:11,740
But you have not drawn on
those strengths, have you?

374
00:50:11,830 --> 00:50:17,800
About your kimono...
You may apologize if you wish.

375
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:23,010
Why, that is a perfect
bow, for a pig farmer.

376
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:26,470
Don't drop your head. Fingertips together.

377
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:30,470
Elbows in. No weight on the hands.

378
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:32,310
Yes.

379
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:35,890
As for the kimono, I'm no fool, Chiyo.

380
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:38,730
Hatsumomo cannot tolerate competition.

381
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:41,310
She is jealous of you?

382
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:43,650
Not me, I'm afraid.

383
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:46,040
Someone closer to home.

384
00:50:48,250 --> 00:50:50,040
Rise.

385
00:50:51,790 --> 00:50:54,080
Not like a horse.

386
00:50:58,090 --> 00:51:00,490
Slide your foot forward.

387
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:04,670
That's it. Now walk.

388
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:07,660
You are a magnificent geisha.

389
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:13,510
Tell me, Chiyo, does Mrs.
Nitta ever speak of the future?

390
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:15,310
Not to me.

391
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:18,020
Well, someday soon, she
will have to name an heir.

392
00:51:18,110 --> 00:51:20,900
One of her own geisha to succeed her.

393
00:51:20,990 --> 00:51:24,400
Strange, isn't it, she has
not adopted Hatsumomo.

394
00:51:24,490 --> 00:51:28,030
That would be like releasing
the tiger from its cage.

395
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:31,070
You have a gift for expression.

396
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:37,000
And if Mrs. Nitta adopts
Pumpkin that is hardly a threat.

397
00:51:37,090 --> 00:51:42,880
But a young girl with eyes like rain...
But Mrs. Nitta would never choose me.

398
00:51:42,970 --> 00:51:46,340
On the contrary, that is our goal.

399
00:51:46,430 --> 00:51:48,550
-It is?
-Of course.

400
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:55,648
<i>If you do not inherit the okiya, then
we will all be at the tiger's mercy.</i>

401
00:51:58,270 --> 00:52:01,060
Water's always in such a hurry.

402
00:52:01,150 --> 00:52:03,560
Perhaps it is just as well.

403
00:52:03,650 --> 00:52:06,450
We have no time to lose.

404
00:52:10,620 --> 00:52:13,450
<i>We must transform you.</i>

405
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:18,380
<i>And what takes years,
you must learn in months.</i>

406
00:52:24,470 --> 00:52:26,630
Say I'm entertaining the Baron.

407
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:30,630
Like so many clients, he's
trapped in an arranged marriage.

408
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:36,890
So in the teahouse, when he's seeking
my company instead I reward him like this:

409
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:39,680
With a glimpse of my wrist.

410
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:47,160
Seeing this demure little trace of
naked skin... Well, it gives him pleasure.

411
00:52:48,490 --> 00:52:50,974
Or when you're sitting down, for the

412
00:52:51,064 --> 00:52:54,110
briefest moment, press
your leg against his.

413
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:57,620
Always by accident, of course.

414
00:53:14,060 --> 00:53:17,640
<i>Mameha, when does a
geisha choose her danna?</i>

415
00:53:17,730 --> 00:53:20,060
<i>I'm afraid it's the other way around.</i>

416
00:53:20,150 --> 00:53:22,270
<i>Focus on your studies, Chiyo.</i>

417
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:25,150
<i>Music, the art of conversation.</i>

418
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:27,980
<i>That's the surest way to attract a danna.</i>

419
00:53:28,070 --> 00:53:31,660
<i>On your feet, not off them.</i>

420
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:10,020
<i>Remember, Chiyo,
geisha are not courtesans.</i>

421
00:54:10,110 --> 00:54:12,360
<i>And we are not wives.</i>

422
00:54:12,450 --> 00:54:16,750
<i>We sell our skills, not our bodies.</i>

423
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,740
<i>We create another secret world.</i>

424
00:54:19,830 --> 00:54:23,210
<i>A place only of beauty.</i>

425
00:54:23,750 --> 00:54:27,210
<i>The very word "geisha" means "artist."</i>

426
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:32,970
<i>And to be a geisha is to be
judged as a moving work of art.</i>

427
00:55:39,950 --> 00:55:44,370
<i>Agony and beauty,
for us, live side by side.</i>

428
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:49,620
<i>Your feet will suffer,
your fingers will bleed.</i>

429
00:55:49,710 --> 00:55:53,760
<i>Even sitting and sleeping will be painful.</i>

430
00:56:01,810 --> 00:56:04,510
<i>You cannot call yourself a true geisha</i>

431
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:08,600
<i>until you can stop a man in
his tracks with a single look.</i>

432
00:56:08,690 --> 00:56:10,810
No one can do that.

433
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:13,240
Choose someone for me.

434
00:56:15,530 --> 00:56:17,700
The grey hat.

435
00:56:40,010 --> 00:56:42,680
<i>Choose someone for me, Onei-san.</i>

436
00:56:42,770 --> 00:56:46,130
The boy on the bike, with one look.

437
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:08,960
You are ready.

438
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:50,870
Hurry up!

439
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:56,624
You are not making money
standing there gawking at yourself.

440
00:57:57,380 --> 00:57:59,380
For luck!

441
00:58:21,530 --> 00:58:25,280
This binds us together forever as sisters.

442
00:58:25,370 --> 00:58:29,370
Today you leave your childhood
and cast away your name.

443
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:33,330
From this day forward,
you will be known as:

444
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:35,920
"Sayuri."

445
00:58:40,090 --> 00:58:43,510
<i>When Mameha granted me my new name</i>

446
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:49,940
<i>I felt little Chiyo disappear
behind a white mask with red lips.</i>

447
00:58:50,350 --> 00:58:52,390
<i>I was a maiko now.</i>

448
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:55,230
<i>An apprentice geisha.</i>

449
00:58:55,570 --> 00:58:59,440
<i>From that moment, I told myself:</i>

450
00:58:59,530 --> 00:59:03,400
<i>"When I make tea, when I pour sake"</i>

451
00:59:03,490 --> 00:59:10,410
<i>when I dance, when I tie my
obi it will be for the Chairman.</i>

452
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:12,990
<i>Until he finds me.</i>

453
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:15,750
<i>"Until I am his."</i>

454
00:59:28,930 --> 00:59:30,930
Ready?

455
00:59:34,060 --> 00:59:36,110
Thank you.

456
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:47,986
Friends <i>we have the pleasure to
witness the debut of a new maiko.</i>

457
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:04,380
I remember those eyes.

458
01:00:04,470 --> 01:00:06,680
What was her name?

459
01:00:08,390 --> 01:00:10,020
Sayuri.

460
01:00:28,780 --> 01:00:30,360
Determined, isn't she?

461
01:00:30,450 --> 01:00:35,490
If there'd been a drop of tea in that
pot, Sayuri would have gotten it out.

462
01:00:35,580 --> 01:00:39,900
Don't tease, Baron,
it is her very first time.

463
01:01:38,810 --> 01:01:42,730
What a beautiful dance, yes, Pumpkin?

464
01:01:42,940 --> 01:01:49,240
Her fans are so hypnotic
that you never notice her feet.

465
01:01:51,070 --> 01:01:54,740
-What's her name?
-Her name is Sayuri.

466
01:01:54,830 --> 01:01:59,040
Sayuri? A name as sweet as she is.

467
01:01:59,460 --> 01:02:05,580
I'm afraid these days even a common
chambermaid can call herself a geisha.

468
01:02:05,670 --> 01:02:11,250
<i>So it's nice to see such a
sincere young maiko. Isn't it?</i>

469
01:02:11,340 --> 01:02:13,010
Why, yes.

470
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:18,100
Surely you would like to thank
Hatsumomo, for her gracious compliments.

471
01:02:18,190 --> 01:02:21,680
There is so much I would
like to say to Hatsumomo.

472
01:02:21,770 --> 01:02:25,706
Sometimes the smartest remark is silence.

473
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:29,860
What better advice to
follow than your own?

474
01:02:29,950 --> 01:02:31,480
Sayuri.

475
01:02:31,570 --> 01:02:35,110
<i>-I was a maiko myself once.
-Of course.</i>

476
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:43,200
But it's been such a very
long long, long, long time.

477
01:02:53,930 --> 01:02:57,060
I shall destroy you.

478
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:03,220
<i>She can destroy you.
She will spread rumors</i>

479
01:03:03,310 --> 01:03:06,890
<i>stalk you from teahouse to
teahouse, then steal your clients.</i>

480
01:03:06,980 --> 01:03:10,080
All in the hope that Mrs.
Nitta adopts Pumpkin instead of you.

481
01:03:10,170 --> 01:03:12,440
-What can we do?
-We've got to outwit her.

482
01:03:12,530 --> 01:03:14,900
To find a place somewhere beyond her reach

483
01:03:14,990 --> 01:03:18,200
where you can practice your
skills without any interference.

484
01:03:18,290 --> 01:03:21,410
-Your first sumo match.
-What?

485
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:23,990
Today you will meet Iwamura Ken.

486
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:27,460
He is head of the Iwamura
Electric Company in Osaka.

487
01:03:27,550 --> 01:03:29,670
My client for years.

488
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:33,090
We will entertain him
and his partner, Nobu.

489
01:03:33,180 --> 01:03:35,880
We may find Nobu quite a challenge.

490
01:03:35,970 --> 01:03:38,680
He does not like geisha.

491
01:03:47,480 --> 01:03:50,648
Be attentive. I will do the rest.

492
01:03:54,070 --> 01:03:56,820
Chairman Iwamura. President Nobu.

493
01:03:56,910 --> 01:03:59,610
This is my new younger sister, Sayuri.

494
01:03:59,700 --> 01:04:01,290
Nobu-san.

495
01:04:03,790 --> 01:04:05,880
Nobu-san.

496
01:04:10,170 --> 01:04:12,630
Injured in Manchuria. War hero.

497
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:16,368
Sayuri, is this your first sumo match?

498
01:04:16,510 --> 01:04:20,470
Nobu-san will have to educate you.
I cannot tell one wrestler from the next.

499
01:04:20,560 --> 01:04:26,416
That is the Chairman's diplomatic
way of saying he hates sumo.

500
01:04:30,530 --> 01:04:32,466
Did you notice our contribution?

501
01:04:32,556 --> 01:04:35,203
We are harnessing the
power of water to bring

502
01:04:35,293 --> 01:04:37,940
electricity to some
of the smaller villages.

503
01:04:38,030 --> 01:04:41,430
-It was in the newspapers, wasn't it?
-With the Chairman's picture.

504
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:46,120
You compensate for all
my shortcomings, don't you?

505
01:04:46,210 --> 01:04:50,620
May I ask, how does someone
harness the power of water?

506
01:04:50,710 --> 01:04:55,040
You should never ask an engineer
to explain a thing, because he will...

507
01:04:55,130 --> 01:04:57,590
Let the girl watch sumo.

508
01:05:06,980 --> 01:05:11,940
Hatsumomo, that snake.
Quick, turn your attention to Nobu.

509
01:05:12,030 --> 01:05:16,690
But, Mameha-neisan Hatsumomo finds
him repulsive. She'd never steal him away.

510
01:05:16,780 --> 01:05:19,910
Mislead her. Go.

511
01:05:36,970 --> 01:05:43,690
Perhaps Nobu-san will be kind
enough to explain the rules of the match.

512
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:49,390
Three things matter in life:
Sumo, business and war.

513
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:51,730
Understand one, you know them all.

514
01:05:51,820 --> 01:05:53,890
But why should a geisha care?

515
01:05:53,980 --> 01:05:58,588
You spend your time
plucking strings and dancing.

516
01:05:59,820 --> 01:06:01,940
I humbly beg to differ.

517
01:06:02,030 --> 01:06:05,110
What is sumo but a dance between giants?

518
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:08,700
What is business but a
dance between companies?

519
01:06:08,790 --> 01:06:12,822
I'd like to know about
every kind of dance.

520
01:06:16,300 --> 01:06:20,236
They are throwing salt to purify the ring.

521
01:06:29,020 --> 01:06:33,890
That man is Miyagiyama,
the greatest fighter in Japan.

522
01:06:33,980 --> 01:06:36,230
But he's so tiny.

523
01:06:36,530 --> 01:06:39,430
Only compared to his opponent.

524
01:06:40,070 --> 01:06:43,530
<i>Miyagiyama may use hataki komi.</i>

525
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:47,200
Are you listening?

526
01:06:47,290 --> 01:06:49,410
Yes.

527
01:06:52,130 --> 01:06:55,655
<i>Hataki komi is a movement
the smaller combatant</i>

528
01:06:55,745 --> 01:06:58,960
<i>uses to throw the larger man off balance.</i>

529
01:06:59,050 --> 01:07:03,130
Victory does not always
belong to the powerful.

530
01:07:03,220 --> 01:07:05,420
Look. There.

531
01:07:05,510 --> 01:07:07,350
In his eyes.

532
01:07:10,100 --> 01:07:12,350
I'm afraid our time has come to a close.

533
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:16,900
-Going so soon?
-Not yet. I want her to see.

534
01:07:35,630 --> 01:07:37,710
<i>Now that is hataki komi!</i>

535
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:40,080
I see now why you like sumo.

536
01:07:40,170 --> 01:07:45,642
You can never judge a man's
power by his appearance alone.

537
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:50,640
Mameha.

538
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:53,850
You may bring her again.

539
01:08:11,410 --> 01:08:15,870
<i>I scoured the newspaper for
the Chairman's photograph.</i>

540
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:20,260
<i>Anything to preserve our moment together.</i>

541
01:08:20,550 --> 01:08:27,170
<i>A moment stolen when I was
forced to turn my attention to Nobu.</i>

542
01:08:27,260 --> 01:08:31,560
<i>In that instant, I felt the world shift.</i>

543
01:08:31,810 --> 01:08:35,100
<i>But not my own determination.</i>

544
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:38,060
<i>I made a secret promise:</i>

545
01:08:38,150 --> 01:08:45,660
<i>Along with his picture, I would lock
away my heart, and save it for him.</i>

546
01:08:52,290 --> 01:08:54,080
Come in.

547
01:08:55,420 --> 01:08:59,540
Tonight we will deliver a
quick blow to Hatsumomo. How?

548
01:08:59,630 --> 01:09:03,750
We will meet Nobu-san at
the Tsunashima restaurant.

549
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:07,050
But first, a visit to Dr. Crab.

550
01:09:07,140 --> 01:09:11,260
Dr. Crab? It's a little nickname
he's earned over the years.

551
01:09:11,350 --> 01:09:13,980
Hold still.

552
01:09:14,680 --> 01:09:17,980
I have something in mind. A plan.

553
01:09:18,530 --> 01:09:20,430
Now cut your leg where I've marked it.

554
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:25,700
-What? Or I will do it for you...
-Have you gone mad?

555
01:09:25,820 --> 01:09:28,720
Do you trust me or don't you?

556
01:09:29,870 --> 01:09:31,870
Well?

557
01:09:39,710 --> 01:09:42,380
Go ahead, do it.

558
01:09:51,050 --> 01:09:53,970
Careless with the sewing
scissors, were you?

559
01:09:54,060 --> 01:09:57,300
Right through your beautiful kimono.
Such a pity.

560
01:09:57,390 --> 01:09:59,970
It won't leave a scar, will it?

561
01:10:00,060 --> 01:10:05,740
Sayuri is a special girl at a
very special time in her life.

562
01:10:07,650 --> 01:10:09,110
Yes.

563
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:15,080
With those eyes, you
must be quite a commodity.

564
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:22,920
Clean cut.

565
01:10:23,210 --> 01:10:26,420
Won't leave a mark, I promise.

566
01:10:26,510 --> 01:10:31,430
But I had best prescribe
a bit of antiseptic.

567
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:51,530
<i>Your honorable sister says,
"Cut your leg," you cut your leg.</i>

568
01:10:51,620 --> 01:10:55,360
<i>She says, "Follow me", you follow her.</i>

569
01:10:55,450 --> 01:11:00,790
<i>My life had turned into a game,
and only she knew the rules.</i>

570
01:11:02,460 --> 01:11:08,300
<i>Ekubo. At the right moment,
slip it to Nobu discreetly.</i>

571
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:13,500
He will know what it means.

572
01:11:18,140 --> 01:11:23,516
-You have kept us waiting.
-Please, forgive us, Nobu-san.

573
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:27,480
The Chairman thinks I should
take more pleasure in life.

574
01:11:27,570 --> 01:11:29,310
Music and the theatre.

575
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:31,910
What is your impression?

576
01:11:33,160 --> 01:11:37,320
It is useless to push a cart sideways.

577
01:11:37,410 --> 01:11:41,580
One could not wish Nobu-san
to be anyone but Nobu-san.

578
01:11:41,670 --> 01:11:43,740
I could not agree more.

579
01:11:43,830 --> 01:11:45,700
I owe this man everything.

580
01:11:45,790 --> 01:11:48,580
He gives me too much credit, as usual.

581
01:11:48,670 --> 01:11:50,720
Probably.

582
01:11:59,680 --> 01:12:01,430
It is a trinket.

583
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:04,440
I found it a few days ago.

584
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:09,770
Nobu-san.
I had no idea you were so sentimental.

585
01:12:09,860 --> 01:12:11,950
Call it my new leaf.

586
01:12:15,370 --> 01:12:17,240
My mother...

587
01:12:17,530 --> 01:12:21,850
My mother, she used to
wear something similar.

588
01:12:23,830 --> 01:12:26,170
You do not like it?

589
01:12:29,630 --> 01:12:34,238
Forgive me.
I've never received a present before.

590
01:12:36,970 --> 01:12:39,640
What a beautiful comb.

591
01:12:41,730 --> 01:12:44,640
Such a joyous moment, Sayuri.

592
01:12:44,730 --> 01:12:48,060
You are finally getting what you deserve.

593
01:12:48,150 --> 01:12:50,230
How lovely.

594
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:54,820
And now, will you excuse us, please?

595
01:12:54,910 --> 01:12:57,650
We have another engagement.

596
01:12:57,740 --> 01:12:59,910
Many, in fact.

597
01:13:01,370 --> 01:13:03,580
Pumpkin.

598
01:13:17,220 --> 01:13:19,550
You are most kind.

599
01:13:31,780 --> 01:13:33,900
Now, give this one to Dr. Crab.

600
01:13:33,990 --> 01:13:36,690
-Mameha, please.
-You're upset?

601
01:13:36,780 --> 01:13:40,130
I want to trust you, I do.
But you have to tell me what's going on.

602
01:13:40,220 --> 01:13:42,110
I am ensuring your future.

603
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:44,950
But tell me how. I beg you.

604
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:47,040
I'm trying to orchestrate a bidding war.

605
01:13:47,130 --> 01:13:49,910
-What for?
-Your most precious attribute.

606
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:53,380
<i>-And what is that?
-Your mizuage.</i>

607
01:13:54,130 --> 01:13:57,880
Did Mother ever tell you
about the eel in the cave?

608
01:13:57,970 --> 01:14:04,630
Well, every once in a while a man's
eel likes to visit a woman's cave.

609
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:06,760
-Yes, I know.
-You do?

610
01:14:06,850 --> 01:14:09,650
I live with Hatsumomo.

611
01:14:10,610 --> 01:14:13,440
Your cave is untouched. Men like that.

612
01:14:13,530 --> 01:14:15,230
<i>We call this mizuage.</i>

613
01:14:15,320 --> 01:14:19,020
And to become a full geisha, you
must sell it to the highest bidder.

614
01:14:19,110 --> 01:14:20,730
Did you sell yours?

615
01:14:20,820 --> 01:14:24,400
The largest sum ever paid.
Ten thousand yen.

616
01:14:24,490 --> 01:14:26,740
I freed myself from debt.

617
01:14:26,830 --> 01:14:29,170
And so will you.

618
01:14:29,670 --> 01:14:31,950
When you slip the rice cake to Dr. Crab

619
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:37,032
<i>it is a sign that says your
mizuage is ripe for sale.</i>

620
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:41,630
The doctor has no
desire to see you tonight.

621
01:14:41,720 --> 01:14:44,010
Or any night.

622
01:14:49,190 --> 01:14:53,270
Pumpkin.
Hatsumomo went to see Dr. Crab, yes?

623
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:55,100
I have to go, Chiyo-chan.

624
01:14:55,190 --> 01:14:57,690
-Didn't she?
-I do not know.

625
01:14:57,780 --> 01:15:00,440
Of course you know.
You shadow her every step.

626
01:15:00,530 --> 01:15:02,430
You expect me to betray my big sister?

627
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:04,280
Has she made you cruel as well?

628
01:15:04,370 --> 01:15:08,710
-No.
-My Pumpkin always told the truth.

629
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:13,880
But... The truth.

630
01:15:19,380 --> 01:15:22,550
Tonight we went to the
teahouse to see Dr. Crab.

631
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:25,490
I sat outside, but I could
still hear through the screen.

632
01:15:25,580 --> 01:15:27,300
And Hatsumomo then said to him:

633
01:15:27,390 --> 01:15:29,300
<i>"I live in the same okiya as Sayuri.</i>

634
01:15:29,390 --> 01:15:32,350
Did you know that she
brings men back to her room?"

635
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:33,970
"No," he said.

636
01:15:34,060 --> 01:15:36,350
"Common sailors and fishermen too."

637
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:39,590
The doctor looked queasy, like
he didn't want to hear any more.

638
01:15:39,680 --> 01:15:41,110
But she kept going.

639
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:43,500
And Hatsumomo said to
him, "What's the matter?

640
01:15:43,590 --> 01:15:47,890
Have I told you more
than you wanted to know?"

641
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:56,080
I'm so sorry. I wanted to say something,
but how could I, Chiyo-chan? How?

642
01:15:56,420 --> 01:15:59,590
Am I really like her? Am I?

643
01:16:00,090 --> 01:16:02,260
Of course not.

644
01:16:03,930 --> 01:16:06,840
Is Mameha-san cruel to you too?

645
01:16:06,930 --> 01:16:10,260
No. She's so kind to me.

646
01:16:10,350 --> 01:16:16,878
But sometimes I worry she's taking
me further from the things I want.

647
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:19,610
That man Nobu.

648
01:16:21,190 --> 01:16:23,520
Do you really like him?

649
01:16:23,610 --> 01:16:27,280
-No.
-That's what I thought.

650
01:16:27,370 --> 01:16:30,410
Do you like somebody else?

651
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:43,710
Don't worry about me,
Chiyo-chan, I'll be fine.

652
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:45,380
Better than fine.

653
01:16:45,470 --> 01:16:47,380
Mother plans to adopt me,

654
01:16:47,470 --> 01:16:52,800
so my dream of having some place
to live out my life may come true.

655
01:16:52,890 --> 01:16:54,770
I have to go.

656
01:17:03,030 --> 01:17:04,610
We could still win, Sayuri.

657
01:17:04,700 --> 01:17:08,740
How? Hatsumomo has
poisoned Dr. Crab against me.

658
01:17:08,830 --> 01:17:12,570
Forget about him.
There are plenty of other fish in the sea.

659
01:17:12,660 --> 01:17:15,030
-The Chairman has been kind...
-Sayuri.

660
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:17,410
Nobu and the Chairman
are business partners.

661
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:20,080
They would never bid against one another.

662
01:17:20,170 --> 01:17:23,146
It is time we cast a wider net.

663
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:28,670
<i>Suppose there was a night in Miyako,
hundreds of men, all in one place</i>

664
01:17:28,760 --> 01:17:31,260
<i>-eager to bid for you.
-What do you mean?</i>

665
01:17:31,350 --> 01:17:34,590
<i>Where you are the
object of all their fantasies.</i>

666
01:17:34,680 --> 01:17:37,430
<i>The most famous geisha in the hanamachi.</i>

667
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:41,110
<i>-But I'm not.
-You will be.</i>

668
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:52,700
Who is responsible for this?

669
01:17:52,790 --> 01:17:54,700
Ask Mameha.

670
01:17:54,790 --> 01:17:57,080
<i>I'm asking you, Okasan.</i>

671
01:17:57,170 --> 01:17:59,080
How come Sayuri gets to be the lead?

672
01:17:59,170 --> 01:18:03,490
It's your own fault.
You should practice more.

673
01:18:06,550 --> 01:18:08,890
What did Mameha do?

674
01:18:10,720 --> 01:18:14,390
Speak to the director in private?

675
01:18:15,060 --> 01:18:19,230
Not every geisha uses
that kind of currency.

676
01:18:22,070 --> 01:18:25,770
I'm looking forward to your performance.

677
01:18:25,860 --> 01:18:32,080
You know how I adore
watching you dance, Chiyo.

678
01:19:04,570 --> 01:19:06,140
They've all come.

679
01:19:06,230 --> 01:19:13,530
The Baron, Nobu-san our beloved
Hatsumomo and that dapper General of hers.

680
01:19:13,620 --> 01:19:15,200
Anybody else?

681
01:19:15,290 --> 01:19:19,040
And even your old friend, Dr. Crab.

682
01:19:31,930 --> 01:19:33,880
What if I dance poorly?

683
01:19:33,970 --> 01:19:38,866
What if I disgrace myself
and no one takes interest?

684
01:19:39,310 --> 01:19:41,650
You will be glorious.

685
01:19:55,490 --> 01:19:58,500
Now it's time.

686
01:23:10,690 --> 01:23:12,600
Sayuri, you remember the doctor.

687
01:23:12,690 --> 01:23:15,600
I hope my performance pleased you, doctor.

688
01:23:15,690 --> 01:23:19,270
Oh, you dance with such profound feeling.

689
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:21,270
I most humbly thank you.

690
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:24,440
It seems you've once again
caught the doctor's interest.

691
01:23:24,530 --> 01:23:26,450
And I am most grateful.

692
01:23:26,540 --> 01:23:29,700
-If you have heard any gossip...
-Yes?

693
01:23:29,790 --> 01:23:33,120
...then I hope you will
follow your own advice.

694
01:23:33,210 --> 01:23:36,710
And what would that be, pray tell?

695
01:23:38,010 --> 01:23:40,380
Seek a second opinion.

696
01:23:50,020 --> 01:23:51,510
Chairman.

697
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:54,810
Sayuri gave such a passionate
performance, don't you think?

698
01:23:54,900 --> 01:23:56,520
Indeed.

699
01:23:56,610 --> 01:24:00,480
Mameha, did you invite the
Chairman to my estate this weekend?

700
01:24:00,570 --> 01:24:02,650
It's my annual blossom-viewing party.

701
01:24:02,740 --> 01:24:06,780
Baron, I told you I can't go.
I have an urgent appointment.

702
01:24:06,870 --> 01:24:09,320
Taking care of a little nuisance?

703
01:24:09,410 --> 01:24:12,830
Or was that a naughty secret?

704
01:24:12,920 --> 01:24:19,170
Baron, wouldn't Sayuri look stunning
among the flowers on your estate?

705
01:24:19,260 --> 01:24:22,840
Yes, very pretty.
Be sure to send her along.

706
01:24:22,930 --> 01:24:25,260
With a chaperone, of course.

707
01:24:25,350 --> 01:24:28,840
I'm certain Mr. Bekku will oblige.

708
01:24:28,930 --> 01:24:33,180
That's a fine idea, Baron.
But Sayuri is required at the theatre.

709
01:24:33,270 --> 01:24:36,520
Mameha, I expect her there.

710
01:24:36,610 --> 01:24:39,350
Nobu. Coming Saturday?

711
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:45,030
All that way to see a cherry tree?
I will leave that to the Chairman.

712
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:48,620
Wonderful tonight. Excuse me.

713
01:24:52,250 --> 01:24:54,960
If you would rather not go.

714
01:24:55,460 --> 01:24:58,300
I'd like to go very much.

715
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:01,790
Then be on your guard, every moment.

716
01:25:01,880 --> 01:25:05,050
<i>There is a reason
Hatsumomo wants you there.</i>

717
01:25:05,140 --> 01:25:07,630
<i>Trust me, I know my Baron, Sayuri.</i>

718
01:25:07,720 --> 01:25:10,720
<i>He has a weakness for beautiful women.</i>

719
01:25:10,810 --> 01:25:16,890
<i>And now you are the most
celebrated geisha in all Miyako.</i>

720
01:25:16,980 --> 01:25:20,150
<i>The most desired as well.</i>

721
01:25:56,850 --> 01:26:00,680
Pardon. Pardon me. Pardon me. Sayuri.

722
01:26:00,770 --> 01:26:05,570
Today, even the cherry
blossoms are envious of her.

723
01:26:13,080 --> 01:26:18,200
There's something I've been wanting
to say to you for some time now.

724
01:26:18,290 --> 01:26:20,380
I'd like to...

725
01:26:22,670 --> 01:26:25,630
To thank you for your
attention to Nobu-san.

726
01:26:25,720 --> 01:26:28,960
Nobu can be a difficult man. So severe.

727
01:26:29,050 --> 01:26:32,380
<i>Hates parties, sake only in moderation.</i>

728
01:26:32,470 --> 01:26:35,390
And he disdains geisha.

729
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:37,390
But he...

730
01:26:37,640 --> 01:26:39,900
He's fond of you.

731
01:26:40,730 --> 01:26:45,360
Because you admire
him, I respect him more.

732
01:26:45,740 --> 01:26:50,440
He will never tell you himself.
He's far too modest.

733
01:26:50,530 --> 01:26:52,690
We were fighting in Manchuria together.

734
01:26:52,780 --> 01:26:54,910
There was an explosion.

735
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:58,120
He protected me from the worst of it.

736
01:26:58,210 --> 01:27:03,130
As you might imagine,
I owe him quite a debt.

737
01:27:03,340 --> 01:27:05,330
Nobu has taught me a great deal.

738
01:27:05,420 --> 01:27:07,500
Patience, for one thing.

739
01:27:07,590 --> 01:27:13,340
I, in turn, have tried to teach him
you have to savor life while you can.

740
01:27:13,430 --> 01:27:16,180
The lesson of the cherry blossom.

741
01:27:16,270 --> 01:27:18,680
That is why Nobu likes you.

742
01:27:18,770 --> 01:27:21,350
We must not expect happiness, Sayuri.

743
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:24,060
It is not something we deserve.

744
01:27:24,150 --> 01:27:27,270
When life goes well, it's a sudden gift.

745
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:29,950
It cannot last forever.

746
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,160
Sayuri.

747
01:27:39,620 --> 01:27:43,590
There you are. I have a present for you.

748
01:27:49,720 --> 01:27:53,840
Mameha asked me to show
you my kimono collection.

749
01:27:53,930 --> 01:27:55,800
It's quite venerated.

750
01:27:55,890 --> 01:28:00,882
My grandfather and father
collected kimono before me.

751
01:28:01,270 --> 01:28:04,560
I've given a number of
valuable kimono to Mameha.

752
01:28:04,650 --> 01:28:08,586
I like to give present to beautiful girls.

753
01:28:10,990 --> 01:28:12,910
It's for you.

754
01:28:16,990 --> 01:28:20,160
Come. Have a closer look.

755
01:28:24,750 --> 01:28:27,000
Isn't it lovely?

756
01:28:30,170 --> 01:28:32,010
Try it on.

757
01:28:34,680 --> 01:28:36,880
The Baron is too kind.

758
01:28:37,010 --> 01:28:41,930
I will happily try it on with Mameha
when the Baron returns to Miyako.

759
01:28:42,020 --> 01:28:43,810
Who knows when that will be?

760
01:28:43,900 --> 01:28:46,940
Put it on now. Don't be shy.

761
01:28:52,610 --> 01:28:54,230
Don't worry.

762
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:59,984
I am experienced in knotting obis.
And untying them as well.

763
01:29:00,540 --> 01:29:03,780
Please. Mr. Bekku is waiting.

764
01:29:03,870 --> 01:29:06,670
Bekku is waiting for no one.

765
01:29:09,050 --> 01:29:10,880
Please!

766
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:14,550
Stop!

767
01:29:21,640 --> 01:29:23,050
Please!

768
01:29:23,140 --> 01:29:25,400
Stop now!

769
01:29:48,750 --> 01:29:53,790
Sayuri I only want to have a look.

770
01:29:54,260 --> 01:29:56,430
No harm in that.

771
01:29:57,090 --> 01:29:59,720
Any man would do the same.

772
01:31:11,500 --> 01:31:14,080
<i>I heard a message on the wind.</i>

773
01:31:14,170 --> 01:31:15,920
So careless.

774
01:31:16,010 --> 01:31:19,250
-You have ruined all our plans.
-I did nothing.

775
01:31:19,340 --> 01:31:23,420
Please, Sayuri, do not insult me.
I know the Baron better than that.

776
01:31:23,510 --> 01:31:24,840
He gave me a kimono.

777
01:31:24,930 --> 01:31:28,260
-You sold yourself for a kimono.
-I did not sell myself!

778
01:31:28,350 --> 01:31:30,970
<i>Today is the day I accept
bids for your mizuage.</i>

779
01:31:31,060 --> 01:31:35,140
What kind of price can I hope to
demand with a finger pointed at your back?

780
01:31:35,230 --> 01:31:37,900
<i>He looked at me, that's all, Onei-san.</i>

781
01:31:37,990 --> 01:31:40,320
<i>You will be examined at
the mizuage ceremony.</i>

782
01:31:40,410 --> 01:31:45,160
If you are found to be
worthless I am not worthless!

783
01:31:47,160 --> 01:31:49,870
I am not worthless.

784
01:32:02,470 --> 01:32:06,590
How much longer is
this bidding going to take?

785
01:32:06,680 --> 01:32:12,560
Besides, who wants a plum when
someone has already had a bite?

786
01:32:29,960 --> 01:32:32,080
What is it?

787
01:32:32,210 --> 01:32:34,490
Twenty yen? Thirty?

788
01:32:34,580 --> 01:32:37,250
This can't be the right amount.

789
01:32:37,340 --> 01:32:41,590
I trust you agree. I have won the wager.

790
01:32:42,590 --> 01:32:44,500
Sayuri's made history.

791
01:32:44,590 --> 01:32:49,678
<i>No mizuage has ever been sold for more.
Not even mine.</i>

792
01:32:50,060 --> 01:32:52,180
Fifteen thousand yen.

793
01:32:52,270 --> 01:32:54,600
Unbelievable.

794
01:32:56,770 --> 01:33:00,520
Of course, none of it will go to Sayuri.

795
01:33:00,610 --> 01:33:05,360
<i>Or to you, Mameha. It goes to this okiya.</i>

796
01:33:05,450 --> 01:33:09,200
All 15,000 yen to this estate.

797
01:33:09,290 --> 01:33:11,490
I do not understand.

798
01:33:11,580 --> 01:33:17,040
That Sayuri will inherit
as my adopted daughter.

799
01:33:17,130 --> 01:33:20,080
-What?
-You wouldn't dare.

800
01:33:20,170 --> 01:33:23,040
I'm entitled to do as I choose.

801
01:33:23,130 --> 01:33:26,800
<i>But you promised the okiya to Pumpkin!</i>

802
01:33:27,640 --> 01:33:32,810
<i>Look at her. Still a virgin maiko.</i>

803
01:33:33,890 --> 01:33:35,890
-Pumpkin!
-Can't you adopt us both?

804
01:33:35,980 --> 01:33:39,560
Quiet, Sayuri. I'm no fool.

805
01:33:39,650 --> 01:33:43,560
Pumpkin would only be Hatsumomo's puppet.

806
01:33:43,650 --> 01:33:48,360
How long will it take before
you kick us out onto the street?

807
01:33:48,450 --> 01:33:50,650
I have given you my life.

808
01:33:50,740 --> 01:33:52,240
Yes.

809
01:33:52,330 --> 01:33:54,200
Your impudence.

810
01:33:54,290 --> 01:33:56,830
Your foul temper.

811
01:33:59,960 --> 01:34:04,290
Who paid for the silk on your back?
The rice in your bowl?

812
01:34:04,380 --> 01:34:07,130
The tobacco in that pipe of yours? Who?

813
01:34:07,220 --> 01:34:11,930
<i>Don't exaggerate!
You have never even had a danna.</i>

814
01:34:12,020 --> 01:34:16,761
-Don't say it. Don't say...
-You chose that no-good Koichi. Stop it.

815
01:34:16,851 --> 01:34:21,520
Sneaking through your window
at all hours of the night. Quiet!

816
01:34:21,610 --> 01:34:24,190
Not like a geisha.

817
01:34:24,280 --> 01:34:27,400
Like a common prostitute.

818
01:34:27,490 --> 01:34:29,620
Enough!

819
01:34:29,740 --> 01:34:33,950
Besides, you are getting old.

820
01:34:35,540 --> 01:34:37,370
But Sayuri?

821
01:34:37,460 --> 01:34:42,340
Sayuri is destined to become a legend.

822
01:34:57,480 --> 01:35:00,810
<i>My dear Okasan.</i>

823
01:35:03,980 --> 01:35:06,570
We will see

824
01:35:07,150 --> 01:35:09,570
won't we?

825
01:35:13,740 --> 01:35:17,070
Sayuri, your room is too small.

826
01:35:17,160 --> 01:35:19,500
Take Hatsumomo's.

827
01:35:21,840 --> 01:35:27,380
From now on, your name is Nitta Sayuri.

828
01:35:27,470 --> 01:35:29,840
May I congratulate you both.

829
01:35:29,930 --> 01:35:32,180
You too.

830
01:35:40,600 --> 01:35:45,610
Everything we wanted, you made happen.
Thank you.

831
01:35:47,610 --> 01:35:49,860
May I ask who?

832
01:35:49,950 --> 01:35:52,280
Dr. Crab.

833
01:35:52,910 --> 01:35:55,030
Was Nobu disappointed?

834
01:35:55,120 --> 01:36:00,304
Nobu did not bid.
It was against his mighty principles.

835
01:36:01,630 --> 01:36:04,710
Dr. Crab was opposed by the Baron.

836
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:06,670
My Baron.

837
01:36:06,760 --> 01:36:10,170
Do you want to know the truth, Sayuri?

838
01:36:10,260 --> 01:36:12,420
He was the highest bidder.

839
01:36:12,510 --> 01:36:16,430
Forgive me. But I let it go to Dr. Crab.

840
01:36:16,520 --> 01:36:18,390
I think you understand why.

841
01:36:18,480 --> 01:36:21,720
I swear to you, I am innocent.

842
01:36:21,810 --> 01:36:23,350
Of course you are.

843
01:36:23,440 --> 01:36:28,770
No man would ever bid so much
for a thing he had already taken.

844
01:36:28,860 --> 01:36:33,200
It was my own fault.
I did not protect you.

845
01:36:39,200 --> 01:36:42,580
Celebrate this moment, Sayuri.

846
01:36:42,670 --> 01:36:48,130
<i>Tonight, the lights in the
hanamachi all burn for you.</i>

847
01:38:26,230 --> 01:38:28,860
My daughter.

848
01:38:38,490 --> 01:38:41,280
You are full geisha now.

849
01:39:04,640 --> 01:39:07,540
What are you doing in my room?

850
01:39:11,820 --> 01:39:15,030
I came to congratulate you.

851
01:39:16,950 --> 01:39:19,110
Please get out.

852
01:39:20,870 --> 01:39:23,370
Why, little Chiyo.

853
01:39:23,660 --> 01:39:26,330
Look what I found.

854
01:39:26,540 --> 01:39:29,950
His initials, how elegant.

855
01:39:30,040 --> 01:39:34,340
You've been hiding
your love for a long time.

856
01:39:34,840 --> 01:39:37,330
The sacrifice every geisha must make.

857
01:39:37,420 --> 01:39:39,180
Don't!

858
01:40:01,030 --> 01:40:05,638
Isn't this where you keep it?
Next to your heart?

859
01:40:15,800 --> 01:40:17,550
Give it back!

860
01:40:24,680 --> 01:40:26,560
Give it back!

861
01:40:35,400 --> 01:40:36,890
No!

862
01:40:36,980 --> 01:40:38,900
Mother!

863
01:40:38,990 --> 01:40:41,910
Pumpkin! Mother!

864
01:40:49,790 --> 01:40:52,080
Kimono!

865
01:40:55,590 --> 01:40:57,270
Kimono, Sayuri!

866
01:41:03,300 --> 01:41:05,720
Kimono! Pumpkin!

867
01:42:05,240 --> 01:42:07,780
<i>I could be her.</i>

868
01:42:07,870 --> 01:42:11,370
<i>Now I am geisha to this house.</i>

869
01:42:14,830 --> 01:42:17,040
<i>I could be her.</i>

870
01:42:17,130 --> 01:42:19,620
<i>Were we so different?</i>

871
01:42:19,710 --> 01:42:21,620
<i>She loved once.</i>

872
01:42:21,710 --> 01:42:24,220
<i>She hoped once.</i>

873
01:42:25,260 --> 01:42:29,180
<i>I might be looking into my own future.</i>

874
01:42:29,510 --> 01:42:34,022
<i>Until the real future
came falling from the air.</i>

875
01:43:46,260 --> 01:43:48,260
Stop.

876
01:44:01,400 --> 01:44:03,890
Oh, Korin. Have you seen Sayuri?

877
01:44:03,980 --> 01:44:06,440
No. I don't know.

878
01:44:16,620 --> 01:44:18,500
Chairman!

879
01:44:18,950 --> 01:44:21,500
They are sending us away,
but they won't say where.

880
01:44:21,590 --> 01:44:25,710
Osaka. But you must not go.
The city is a prime target.

881
01:44:25,800 --> 01:44:28,590
Get your things, quickly.

882
01:44:29,970 --> 01:44:35,810
Nobu and I are trying to find safe havens,
for as many of you as we can. Come.

883
01:44:39,980 --> 01:44:41,980
Here.

884
01:44:42,190 --> 01:44:44,390
Work certificate. Nurse's aide.

885
01:44:44,480 --> 01:44:46,940
Friend of mine is chief
surgeon in Kameoka.

886
01:44:47,030 --> 01:44:49,600
What about Sayuri? Can't we go together?

887
01:44:49,690 --> 01:44:53,434
Don't worry. She will be taken care of.

888
01:44:56,740 --> 01:44:59,240
Here you are. Here we go!

889
01:44:59,330 --> 01:45:01,750
Sayuri.

890
01:45:02,250 --> 01:45:03,830
Sayuri! Come.

891
01:45:05,170 --> 01:45:09,330
This is Arima.
He will take you into the hills.

892
01:45:09,420 --> 01:45:13,050
Nobu has got a friend there.
A kimono-maker.

893
01:45:13,140 --> 01:45:16,600
Anyone stops you, show them this.

894
01:45:18,140 --> 01:45:22,748
-Do I have to go?
-It's remote. You will be safe.

895
01:45:24,350 --> 01:45:28,100
What about you?
You said Osaka was dangerous.

896
01:45:28,190 --> 01:45:33,320
Our factory is there. I have no choice.

897
01:45:37,030 --> 01:45:38,780
Go!

898
01:45:38,870 --> 01:45:43,830
I will express your gratitude to Nobu-san.

899
01:46:04,350 --> 01:46:12,350
<i>A year without news except
news of death, defeat, shame.</i>

900
01:46:13,240 --> 01:46:19,320
<i>Rumors of cities evaporating
into clouds of smoke.</i>

901
01:46:19,410 --> 01:46:27,410
<i>Then another year, and then another
until the old life is a dream life.</i>

902
01:46:28,920 --> 01:46:31,510
<i>Was I ever geisha?</i>

903
01:46:32,090 --> 01:46:36,750
<i>Did I ever dance holding a fan?</i>

904
01:46:36,840 --> 01:46:43,310
<i>Who would hold a fan
now, or paint their lips?</i>

905
01:46:44,560 --> 01:46:47,100
<i>And then another year.</i>

906
01:46:47,440 --> 01:46:49,350
<i>Nothing.</i>

907
01:46:49,440 --> 01:46:51,020
<i>Rice.</i>

908
01:46:51,110 --> 01:46:52,520
<i>Work.</i>

909
01:46:52,610 --> 01:46:54,600
<i>Rice.</i>

910
01:46:54,690 --> 01:46:56,690
<i>Work.</i>

911
01:46:56,780 --> 01:46:59,120
<i>Nothing.</i>

912
01:47:05,210 --> 01:47:07,330
Sayuri!

913
01:47:09,580 --> 01:47:13,804
Sayuri!
A man from Osaka has come to see you.

914
01:47:38,610 --> 01:47:40,950
Nobu-san.

915
01:47:47,040 --> 01:47:51,080
General Tottori was captured
and tried as a war criminal.

916
01:47:51,170 --> 01:47:56,710
The Baron lost his fortune
and committed suicide.

917
01:47:56,800 --> 01:47:58,500
<i>What about the okiya?</i>

918
01:47:58,590 --> 01:48:03,510
Mr. Bekku is gone, but the others...
Auntie and Mother?

919
01:48:03,850 --> 01:48:07,020
Indestructible, as always.

920
01:48:08,440 --> 01:48:10,560
And the Chairman?

921
01:48:12,230 --> 01:48:14,940
As well as can be expected.

922
01:48:17,900 --> 01:48:21,836
This is all that remains of our factories.

923
01:48:25,040 --> 01:48:27,700
I'm so sorry, Nobu-san.

924
01:48:29,790 --> 01:48:31,880
Sayuri...

925
01:48:35,300 --> 01:48:40,960
We want to rebuild, but to
do that we will need your help.

926
01:48:41,050 --> 01:48:42,880
What can I do?

927
01:48:42,970 --> 01:48:50,768
Somewhere, under those rags are
you still the greatest geisha in Miyako?

928
01:48:54,560 --> 01:49:00,060
If a tree has no leaves or
branches, can you still call it a tree?

929
01:49:00,150 --> 01:49:07,158
With nothing but rubble at my feet,
can I still call myself a businessman?

930
01:49:16,090 --> 01:49:18,500
I should have taken better care of you.

931
01:49:18,590 --> 01:49:22,340
Please, you saved my life.

932
01:49:22,840 --> 01:49:25,680
I owe you so much in return.

933
01:49:28,350 --> 01:49:31,350
The Chairman and I
need American financing.

934
01:49:31,440 --> 01:49:38,270
There is a man, a certain Colonel Derricks
who has the power to grant us a contract.

935
01:49:38,360 --> 01:49:41,450
I showed him your picture.

936
01:49:41,860 --> 01:49:44,870
He asked to meet you.

937
01:49:49,450 --> 01:49:52,700
I am not a persuasive man, Sayuri.

938
01:49:52,790 --> 01:49:59,870
But if you and a few geisha would
once again put on your kimono and join us

939
01:49:59,960 --> 01:50:04,380
we could show the Americans
how hospitable our country can be.

940
01:50:04,470 --> 01:50:07,640
How I wish, Nobu-san.

941
01:50:09,140 --> 01:50:10,880
But that was a long time ago.

942
01:50:10,970 --> 01:50:13,810
I have no doubt, Sayuri

943
01:50:14,140 --> 01:50:18,140
that you could still melt
the heart of any man.

944
01:50:18,230 --> 01:50:21,150
No matter how resistant.

945
01:50:23,650 --> 01:50:27,160
I am not accustomed to begging,

946
01:50:28,370 --> 01:50:32,330
but please know that if you consent

947
01:50:33,410 --> 01:50:37,346
the Chairman and I would be most grateful.

948
01:50:42,260 --> 01:50:43,580
One dollar. One dollar.

949
01:50:43,670 --> 01:50:46,640
-What?
-One dollar.

950
01:51:13,040 --> 01:51:15,700
<i>The Chairman needed me.</i>

951
01:51:15,790 --> 01:51:19,620
<i>But I was a far cry from
the geisha I had once been.</i>

952
01:51:19,710 --> 01:51:21,370
Hey, mama-san, let's step inside.

953
01:51:21,460 --> 01:51:27,170
<i>The secrets of our hidden world
were postcards now for girls back home.</i>

954
01:51:27,260 --> 01:51:34,220
<i>Any streetwalker with a painted face and
silk kimono could call herself a geisha.</i>

955
01:51:36,480 --> 01:51:40,020
<i>I looked for the one
person who might help:</i>

956
01:51:40,110 --> 01:51:42,180
<i>Mameha.</i>

957
01:51:42,270 --> 01:51:45,400
<i>The war was written on her face.</i>

958
01:51:45,490 --> 01:51:51,346
<i>Everything about her, not just
her home, was less than before.</i>

959
01:51:51,490 --> 01:51:57,570
Sayuri, when my poor Baron filled his
pockets with stones I was desperate.

960
01:51:57,660 --> 01:51:59,370
What could I do?

961
01:51:59,460 --> 01:52:04,452
I sold my kimono, I traded
my jade combs for rations.

962
01:52:05,090 --> 01:52:08,670
It was painful at first, but
I have made my peace.

963
01:52:08,760 --> 01:52:13,340
Now, I make a small but
tidy living renting rooms.

964
01:52:13,430 --> 01:52:16,430
I am not about to go chasing the past.

965
01:52:16,520 --> 01:52:18,640
It might do you good.

966
01:52:19,770 --> 01:52:22,600
-How?
-To remind you that, once

967
01:52:22,690 --> 01:52:29,506
with a single glance, you could
bring a man like the Baron to his knees.

968
01:52:36,240 --> 01:52:38,120
Well.

969
01:52:38,540 --> 01:52:40,740
I did keep one kimono.

970
01:52:51,010 --> 01:52:55,522
<i>The Baron gave it to me
when he became my danna.</i>

971
01:53:01,520 --> 01:53:04,690
<i>Thank you, Onei-san.</i>

972
01:53:08,320 --> 01:53:14,070
So tell me. What do we know
about entertaining Americans?

973
01:53:30,300 --> 01:53:32,250
-Was she worth it?
-Hell, yeah.

974
01:53:32,340 --> 01:53:35,140
-Come on.
-All right.

975
01:53:51,700 --> 01:53:54,780
Chiyo-chan! Is that you?

976
01:54:06,380 --> 01:54:10,080
I have no right to ask favors
of you, Pumpkin, I know that.

977
01:54:10,170 --> 01:54:12,750
Guess what.
I only smoke Chesterfields now.

978
01:54:12,840 --> 01:54:16,960
<i>I have wanted to apologize to
you for so long about the okiya.</i>

979
01:54:17,050 --> 01:54:19,650
These soldiers, you know
who they've got me singing?

980
01:54:19,740 --> 01:54:22,890
-It should have gone to you.
-Frank Sinatra and Dinah Shore.

981
01:54:22,980 --> 01:54:29,070
If it is in your heart to forgive me...
Sayuri, don't.

982
01:54:31,230 --> 01:54:33,400
The honest truth?

983
01:54:34,490 --> 01:54:38,740
I'd rather chew sand
than go back to all that.

984
01:54:38,830 --> 01:54:41,806
Then you are not angry with me?

985
01:54:44,920 --> 01:54:47,910
Don't worry about me, chickadee.

986
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:51,840
I've got more clients than I can handle.

987
01:54:52,840 --> 01:54:56,670
You seem so at home with these Americans.

988
01:54:56,760 --> 01:54:58,930
They're bastards.

989
01:55:00,600 --> 01:55:05,050
So who's this colonel?
Sounds like top brass.

990
01:55:05,140 --> 01:55:11,100
He has the power to approve American
funding, for Nobu and the Chairman.

991
01:55:11,190 --> 01:55:15,650
So is he willing to pay
us American dollars?

992
01:55:15,740 --> 01:55:18,240
Cash?

993
01:55:18,870 --> 01:55:21,610
Don't waste my time.

994
01:55:21,700 --> 01:55:23,570
You think I'm a sucker?

995
01:55:23,660 --> 01:55:30,860
I want 60 cases Lucky Strike, or I'm
taking my business to Sergeant MacPhee.

996
01:55:32,710 --> 01:55:36,170
<i>I had to become a geisha once more.</i>

997
01:55:36,260 --> 01:55:41,720
<i>Mother had reopened the okiya,
but my powder box was empty.</i>

998
01:55:41,810 --> 01:55:45,350
<i>My charcoal had turned to dust.</i>

999
01:55:45,810 --> 01:55:51,310
<i>And yet, it was my one chance
to see the Chairman again.</i>

1000
01:55:51,570 --> 01:55:53,810
<i>Would he notice my weathered hands?</i>

1001
01:55:53,900 --> 01:55:55,650
<i>The threadbare silk?</i>

1002
01:55:55,740 --> 01:55:59,780
See? You are yourself again.

1003
01:55:59,870 --> 01:56:05,290
<i>The world had changed completely. Had he?</i>

1004
01:56:05,500 --> 01:56:11,740
<i>And would I finally find the
strength to tell him all that I felt?</i>

1005
01:56:34,480 --> 01:56:39,690
Just look at you, Sayuri.
It's as if the war did not happen.

1006
01:56:39,780 --> 01:56:42,610
I am so glad to see that
the Chairman is safe.

1007
01:56:42,700 --> 01:56:46,280
Accept my apologies asking this of you...
No.

1008
01:56:46,370 --> 01:56:51,074
There is nothing I can
do to return your kindness.

1009
01:56:51,460 --> 01:56:55,300
-I've wanted to tell you that...
-Sayuri!

1010
01:56:58,880 --> 01:57:02,840
May I present Colonel Derricks.

1011
01:57:04,720 --> 01:57:07,130
My God, you're more stunning in person.

1012
01:57:07,220 --> 01:57:09,470
This is my associate, Lieutenant Hutchins.

1013
01:57:09,560 --> 01:57:10,800
It's an honor, ma'am.

1014
01:57:10,890 --> 01:57:14,680
Sayuri is one of the mysteries
of the Orient I told you about.

1015
01:57:14,770 --> 01:57:17,730
A mystery that perhaps you can solve.

1016
01:57:17,820 --> 01:57:21,110
-Would you mind? Can we? Colonel.
-Yes, of course. Colonel.

1017
01:57:21,200 --> 01:57:23,490
Okay, sure.

1018
01:57:25,080 --> 01:57:26,360
Good.

1019
01:57:26,450 --> 01:57:28,990
All right, hold it. Beautiful.

1020
01:57:29,080 --> 01:57:31,700
Hey, who likes whiskey?

1021
01:57:31,790 --> 01:57:33,660
Look at this. We got a live one, sir.

1022
01:57:33,750 --> 01:57:37,410
Chairman, please don't tell me
you started the party without me.

1023
01:57:37,500 --> 01:57:40,260
May I present Pumpkin.

1024
01:57:41,630 --> 01:57:44,590
-Hello!
-Pumpkin! Over here.

1025
01:57:45,220 --> 01:57:47,010
One sec.

1026
01:57:47,100 --> 01:57:49,590
Okay! Gentlemen! Please.

1027
01:57:49,680 --> 01:57:52,180
-Oh, it's been a long time.
-Good to see you.

1028
01:57:52,270 --> 01:57:56,782
You haven't changed.
You look like a little boy.

1029
01:57:57,860 --> 01:58:00,320
This is a... My!

1030
01:58:03,530 --> 01:58:07,080
It's huge! Like an elephant.

1031
01:58:09,910 --> 01:58:13,420
Please, have a seat. Buckle up.

1032
01:58:14,210 --> 01:58:16,080
I'm excited, but I'm scared.

1033
01:58:16,170 --> 01:58:19,242
You're not going anywhere! Okay?

1034
01:58:45,820 --> 01:58:47,990
Good for him, not so good for us.

1035
01:58:48,080 --> 01:58:51,070
May we join you, gentlemen?

1036
01:58:51,160 --> 01:58:53,410
-Yes, please.
-Wow, I could get used to this.

1037
01:58:53,500 --> 01:58:56,910
Back home, a bath is nothing
more than a quick shower on cold tile

1038
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:58,660
with a bar of lye soap, right?

1039
01:58:58,750 --> 01:59:01,420
But here, you make
everything a ritual, don't you?

1040
01:59:01,510 --> 01:59:05,500
That is the art of turning
habit into pleasure, colonel.

1041
01:59:05,590 --> 01:59:07,500
Spoken like a true geisha.

1042
01:59:07,590 --> 01:59:12,090
If we are in business together, then
perhaps we will visit you someday.

1043
01:59:12,180 --> 01:59:14,390
I'd like to see the United States.

1044
01:59:14,480 --> 01:59:16,510
I know a little game we can play.

1045
01:59:16,600 --> 01:59:20,610
It's called Truth and Lies.

1046
01:59:20,860 --> 01:59:25,564
I know this game.
Back home we call it "marriage."

1047
01:59:26,450 --> 01:59:30,320
No, I'm serious. Now, listen closely.

1048
01:59:30,410 --> 01:59:34,530
-Sayuri know the rules.
-I never met a woman who didn't.

1049
01:59:34,620 --> 01:59:39,040
Each person says two things.
One is true, the other is not.

1050
01:59:39,130 --> 01:59:43,870
If you guess right,
the liar pays the price.

1051
01:59:43,960 --> 01:59:47,040
So it pays to lose.

1052
01:59:47,130 --> 01:59:48,880
There you go.

1053
01:59:48,970 --> 01:59:52,220
Okay, I'll go first. Let's see.

1054
01:59:52,310 --> 01:59:58,890
One day in Sapporo, where I was
born a fisherman caught a talking fish.

1055
01:59:58,980 --> 02:00:01,180
The other story is the true one.

1056
02:00:01,270 --> 02:00:03,690
And I haven't even heard it yet.

1057
02:00:03,780 --> 02:00:07,230
-How would you know?
-No, no. You drink. You drink.

1058
02:00:07,320 --> 02:00:12,150
-If I drown, it's all your fault.
-Nobu-san, your turn. Please.

1059
02:00:12,240 --> 02:00:16,490
I'm no match for these geisha.
They are experts in the art of deceit.

1060
02:00:16,580 --> 02:00:20,490
I'm an expert in one
thing and one thing only:

1061
02:00:20,580 --> 02:00:22,540
<i>Sake.</i>

1062
02:00:22,630 --> 02:00:26,170
Sayuri, the truest story you know.

1063
02:00:27,760 --> 02:00:34,680
Once, when I was a little girl
on the banks of the Sunagawa

1064
02:00:34,770 --> 02:00:39,760
a handsome stranger was kind
enough to buy me a cup of sweet ice

1065
02:00:39,850 --> 02:00:41,930
I think we have to stop the game.

1066
02:00:42,020 --> 02:00:45,440
<i>If Pumpkin drinks any
more sake, she will pass out.</i>

1067
02:00:45,530 --> 02:00:50,138
-That is a true story.
-Mameha. Sayuri. Everyone.

1068
02:00:50,780 --> 02:00:53,870
-I'm sorry.
-Okay.

1069
02:00:55,660 --> 02:00:57,700
So.

1070
02:00:57,790 --> 02:01:00,700
What is the protocol?

1071
02:01:00,790 --> 02:01:02,290
Excuse me?

1072
02:01:02,380 --> 02:01:05,460
Suppose I wanted to see you in private.

1073
02:01:05,550 --> 02:01:10,960
I beg your pardon, colonel,
that is not a geisha's custom.

1074
02:01:11,050 --> 02:01:14,880
Don't be coy. I mean, if it's
a question of price, I'm sure...

1075
02:01:14,970 --> 02:01:19,578
If there were a price,
you could never afford it.

1076
02:01:22,650 --> 02:01:24,310
I saw the two of you whispering.

1077
02:01:24,400 --> 02:01:27,140
You have arranged some
kind of tryst, haven't you?

1078
02:01:27,230 --> 02:01:30,520
-What did you promise him?
-Your company. Nothing more.

1079
02:01:30,610 --> 02:01:32,570
He seemed to expect a great deal!

1080
02:01:32,660 --> 02:01:35,900
If I had wanted a common
whore, I could have hired one.

1081
02:01:35,990 --> 02:01:37,610
What are you trying to say?

1082
02:01:37,700 --> 02:01:44,580
Just the idea of you with him,
with any man you'd be dead to me!

1083
02:01:55,100 --> 02:01:59,036
Can't you see that I want you for myself?

1084
02:01:59,600 --> 02:02:01,600
You have ruined me.

1085
02:02:01,850 --> 02:02:05,900
Before we met, I was a disciplined man.

1086
02:02:07,770 --> 02:02:10,520
I should not have asked you to come.

1087
02:02:10,610 --> 02:02:12,940
The Chairman was against it.

1088
02:02:13,030 --> 02:02:16,030
I should have listened to him.

1089
02:02:26,630 --> 02:02:29,540
I must beg your forgiveness, Nobu-san.

1090
02:02:29,630 --> 02:02:33,790
I was foolish to think
you would barter me away.

1091
02:02:33,880 --> 02:02:36,180
Then you made no
arrangement with the colonel?

1092
02:02:36,270 --> 02:02:39,170
Please don't insult me again.

1093
02:02:40,640 --> 02:02:46,520
If he ratifies our contract then
I will be a man of means again.

1094
02:02:46,610 --> 02:02:50,570
There is nothing I want more, Sayuri

1095
02:02:51,230 --> 02:02:54,360
<i>than to become your danna.</i>

1096
02:02:57,620 --> 02:02:59,570
I already owe you far too much.

1097
02:02:59,660 --> 02:03:01,910
-I will not be refused.
-Please.

1098
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:05,580
We are tied to each other.
I know you feel it too.

1099
02:03:05,670 --> 02:03:09,000
I never meant to mislead you.

1100
02:03:10,920 --> 02:03:13,300
Sayuri.

1101
02:03:14,970 --> 02:03:22,470
I do not like things held up
before me that I cannot have.

1102
02:03:24,270 --> 02:03:28,930
When you first introduced me to Nobu I
was such a fool to give him my attention.

1103
02:03:29,020 --> 02:03:31,770
-You cannot refuse him. You must not.
-But, Mameha...

1104
02:03:31,860 --> 02:03:35,150
What is he to think?
He safeguarded your life.

1105
02:03:35,240 --> 02:03:37,540
-So he owns it?
-Sayuri.

1106
02:03:37,740 --> 02:03:40,740
<i>I know what it is like to try
and scrape by without a danna.</i>

1107
02:03:40,830 --> 02:03:42,990
I will do something, anything else.

1108
02:03:43,080 --> 02:03:46,030
Renting rooms? Scrounging for every meal?

1109
02:03:46,120 --> 02:03:48,040
Is this the life that you want?

1110
02:03:48,130 --> 02:03:50,620
I want a life that is mine!

1111
02:03:50,710 --> 02:03:54,120
Nobu has never treated you
with anything but kindness.

1112
02:03:54,210 --> 02:03:57,420
-I don't want mere kindness.
-What?

1113
02:03:57,510 --> 02:04:00,970
What more can we expect, we geisha?

1114
02:04:02,060 --> 02:04:06,092
You had feelings for
the Baron, didn't you?

1115
02:04:06,890 --> 02:04:09,810
I never allowed myself that.

1116
02:04:09,900 --> 02:04:11,730
Don't lie to me.

1117
02:04:11,820 --> 02:04:14,060
In time, you learn.

1118
02:04:14,150 --> 02:04:17,490
-I don't want to learn!
-Sayuri!

1119
02:04:18,320 --> 02:04:21,400
We don't become geisha
to pursue our own destinies.

1120
02:04:21,490 --> 02:04:25,830
We become geisha
because we have no choice.

1121
02:04:44,010 --> 02:04:45,510
Pumpkin.

1122
02:04:45,600 --> 02:04:47,300
What is it? What's wrong?

1123
02:04:47,390 --> 02:04:50,430
Nothing.
I have a favor to ask, that's all.

1124
02:04:50,520 --> 02:04:52,310
Ask.

1125
02:04:52,440 --> 02:04:56,980
At 9:00, bring Nobu to the pool
on the far side of the garden.

1126
02:04:57,070 --> 02:05:01,294
Not a minute before, not a minute after.
Yes?

1127
02:05:01,870 --> 02:05:05,860
And, please, do not tell Nobu
that I will be there waiting.

1128
02:05:05,950 --> 02:05:08,120
It's a surprise?

1129
02:05:08,210 --> 02:05:11,540
Yes, it's a surprise.

1130
02:05:49,750 --> 02:05:51,920
Whoa, in here?

1131
02:05:53,330 --> 02:05:58,130
What? No, no, no. Hang on.
Hey, hey, hey. No, whoa.

1132
02:06:09,600 --> 02:06:11,850
I think we have done it.

1133
02:06:11,940 --> 02:06:15,150
Let's make sure he signs.

1134
02:06:23,110 --> 02:06:25,070
Wait!

1135
02:06:25,160 --> 02:06:27,780
Are we doing this or not?

1136
02:06:27,910 --> 02:06:29,790
Yes?

1137
02:07:01,150 --> 02:07:03,650
Chairman.

1138
02:07:03,820 --> 02:07:05,700
Chairman!

1139
02:07:13,330 --> 02:07:15,330
How could you?

1140
02:07:15,420 --> 02:07:18,580
You don't know what you have done!

1141
02:07:18,670 --> 02:07:20,670
But I do.

1142
02:07:22,010 --> 02:07:24,670
I do not understand.

1143
02:07:24,760 --> 02:07:27,710
Why did you have to bring the Chairman?

1144
02:07:27,800 --> 02:07:31,448
Because I know how you feel about him.

1145
02:07:32,100 --> 02:07:37,100
A long time ago, you
took something from me.

1146
02:07:37,190 --> 02:07:41,190
The only thing I'd ever truly wanted.

1147
02:07:42,530 --> 02:07:44,440
Well

1148
02:07:45,200 --> 02:07:48,740
now you know how it feels.

1149
02:09:21,460 --> 02:09:26,210
<i>The heart dies a slow death.</i>

1150
02:09:26,300 --> 02:09:29,970
<i>Shedding each hope like leaves.</i>

1151
02:09:30,470 --> 02:09:33,880
<i>Until one day there are none.</i>

1152
02:09:33,970 --> 02:09:36,260
<i>No hopes.</i>

1153
02:09:36,470 --> 02:09:39,600
<i>Nothing remains.</i>

1154
02:09:41,480 --> 02:09:45,650
<i>She paints her face to hide her face.</i>

1155
02:09:45,820 --> 02:09:48,990
<i>Her eyes are deep water.</i>

1156
02:09:49,990 --> 02:09:53,490
<i>It is not for geisha to want.</i>

1157
02:09:53,660 --> 02:09:57,160
<i>It is not for geisha to feel.</i>

1158
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:03,500
<i>Geisha is an artist of the floating world.</i>

1159
02:10:03,830 --> 02:10:06,330
<i>She dances.</i>

1160
02:10:06,420 --> 02:10:08,370
<i>She sings.</i>

1161
02:10:08,460 --> 02:10:11,420
<i>She entertains you.</i>

1162
02:10:11,510 --> 02:10:13,930
<i>Whatever you want.</i>

1163
02:10:14,180 --> 02:10:17,100
<i>The rest is shadows.</i>

1164
02:10:17,680 --> 02:10:21,020
<i>The rest is secret.</i>

1165
02:10:29,610 --> 02:10:33,900
Sayuri, quickly. The teahouse just called.

1166
02:10:33,990 --> 02:10:38,450
You are to meet a very
important client tonight.

1167
02:10:38,540 --> 02:10:40,070
Who?

1168
02:10:40,160 --> 02:10:44,040
It must be Nobu. Yes.

1169
02:10:45,540 --> 02:10:51,050
He is going to be one of
the richest men in Osaka.

1170
02:10:51,550 --> 02:10:55,460
He wants to honor his promise:

1171
02:10:55,550 --> 02:10:59,260
<i>To become your danna at last.</i>

1172
02:11:01,140 --> 02:11:03,270
Give me.

1173
02:11:03,890 --> 02:11:06,810
It's about time.

1174
02:11:06,900 --> 02:11:11,850
Finally, a return on my investment.

1175
02:11:11,940 --> 02:11:17,910
Keiko, maybe one day you will be as lucky.

1176
02:11:19,200 --> 02:11:22,370
No geisha can ever hope for more.

1177
02:11:23,580 --> 02:11:26,170
Let me see it.

1178
02:12:37,320 --> 02:12:39,700
Chairman.

1179
02:12:39,820 --> 02:12:41,690
Where is Nobu-san?

1180
02:12:41,780 --> 02:12:43,700
He won't be coming.

1181
02:12:43,790 --> 02:12:45,160
Is something wrong?

1182
02:12:45,250 --> 02:12:50,818
He knows what happened.
It is not in his nature to forgive.

1183
02:12:52,130 --> 02:12:58,950
Chairman, what happened on the island...
Please, you do not have to explain.

1184
02:12:59,840 --> 02:13:04,420
But I have shamed myself
so deeply, past all forgiveness.

1185
02:13:04,510 --> 02:13:09,190
No. I'm the one who must be forgiven.

1186
02:13:11,650 --> 02:13:13,820
I do not understand.

1187
02:13:15,860 --> 02:13:21,584
Perhaps if you had only known the truth...

1188
02:13:22,530 --> 02:13:24,870
The truth?

1189
02:13:27,660 --> 02:13:30,080
Some years ago.

1190
02:13:30,540 --> 02:13:33,040
I was on my way to the theatre.

1191
02:13:33,130 --> 02:13:36,580
I saw a little girl weeping
by the Sunagawa.

1192
02:13:36,670 --> 02:13:41,380
I stopped to buy her a cup of sweet ice.

1193
02:13:41,590 --> 02:13:44,630
You knew I was that little girl?

1194
02:13:44,720 --> 02:13:50,192
Didn't you ever wonder why
Mameha took you under her wing?

1195
02:13:50,980 --> 02:13:54,690
Mameha came to me because of you.

1196
02:14:02,240 --> 02:14:05,280
I wish you could have told me long ago.

1197
02:14:05,370 --> 02:14:07,490
What could I do?

1198
02:14:07,580 --> 02:14:09,820
I owe Nobu my life.

1199
02:14:09,910 --> 02:14:12,330
And so

1200
02:14:12,580 --> 02:14:17,960
when I saw he had a chance at
happiness with you, I stood silent.

1201
02:14:18,050 --> 02:14:20,340
But...

1202
02:14:22,260 --> 02:14:25,430
But I cannot any longer.

1203
02:14:25,930 --> 02:14:28,220
I hope

1204
02:14:29,520 --> 02:14:32,390
it is not too late.

1205
02:14:35,610 --> 02:14:40,110
Don't be afraid to look at me, Chiyo.

1206
02:14:52,580 --> 02:14:54,790
Can't you see?

1207
02:14:56,710 --> 02:15:03,800
Every step I have taken...
since I was that child on the bridge

1208
02:15:04,260 --> 02:15:08,220
has been to bring myself closer to you.

1209
02:16:13,160 --> 02:16:17,080
<i>You cannot say to the sun, "More sun."</i>

1210
02:16:17,170 --> 02:16:20,620
<i>Or to the rain, "Less rain."</i>

1211
02:16:20,710 --> 02:16:25,460
<i>To a man, geisha can only be half a wife.</i>

1212
02:16:25,550 --> 02:16:28,890
<i>We are the wives of nightfall.</i>

1213
02:16:29,180 --> 02:16:35,720
<i>And yet, to learn of kindness
after so much unkindness</i>

1214
02:16:35,810 --> 02:16:41,270
<i>to understand that a little girl
with more courage than she knew</i>

1215
02:16:41,360 --> 02:16:49,070
<i>would find her prayers were answered...
can that not be called happiness?</i>

1216
02:16:49,740 --> 02:16:57,700
<i>After all... these are not the memoirs
of an empress, nor of a queen.</i>

1217
02:16:57,790 --> 02:17:02,290
<i>These are memoirs of another kind.</i>
