1
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:25,000
Nothing is working.

2
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,625
Let me try again.

3
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:51,875
You've pampered him a lot.

4
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:53,000
My mistake.

5
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:55,375
I shouldn't have brought
this superhero DVDs for him.

6
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:58,750
Stubborn guy. If you do this again,
I will break your bone.

7
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:00,000
What's in your hand? Give it to me.

8
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,625
What's in your hand? Give it to me.

9
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,875
Next year, you will go
to the boarding school for sure.

10
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:06,500
He can't think of anything
other than the superhero.

11
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:10,750
What you dream of becoming,
is possible in stories only.

12
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:13,000
There's no superhero in real life.

13
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,375
But I can be one, mon.

14
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:18,750
You don't need any magical
powers to be the hero.

15
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:21,625
Real superhero is one,
who fights for injustice,

16
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:22,875
even without the power.

17
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:31,625
Why did you call me, Michael?

18
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,875
Tell me one thing.
Spiderman was orphan, right?

19
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
That's right.

20
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:38,500
Batman could become a superhero,

21
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,750
only after losing his parents, right?

22
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:42,000
Yes, of course.

23
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:43,875
Had their parents been alive,

24
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,625
they would have never
become the superheroes.

25
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:48,000
Never.

26
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:52,875
Michael! Michael!

27
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,000
Open the door, Michael.

28
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,000
Hurry up, man.

29
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:46,875
Will you take ten days
for one bank robbery?

30
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:14,000
Who are you?

31
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,125
He's the world famous
superhero of the country.

32
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,375
Is that so?

33
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:22,750
Then let's kill him and gain fame.

34
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:24,125
Attack.

35
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:19,750
Superhero, huh?!

36
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,750
Forget it, it's not your cup of tea.

37
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,250
Take all the money but spare me.

38
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:23,625
Spare me.

39
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:28,375
Superheroes never kill, I guess.

40
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:34,375
Is that so?

41
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,750
Stop!

42
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,500
Don't move!

43
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:20,500
Once again this mysterious
man is on the headlines,

44
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:22,125
by saving public's money.

45
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:25,000
This time he has stopped the robbers

46
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:27,750
from looting cash worth ten millions.

47
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,250
-At what price?
-What happened, Rosy?

48
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,375
-As you can see...
-Why don't you cooperate?

49
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,375
Didn't we enjoy last night?

50
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,375
Then why are you sulking now?

51
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,750
Come to me, baby.

52
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,625
Such attitude?!

53
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,000
Got you!

54
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,250
Shazam!

55
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:05,500
It's working.

56
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,500
Hi, chief!

57
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:13,875
Siri.

58
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:17,625
He's talking to me and not to you.

59
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:19,000
How's it, Chief?

60
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:20,500
Oh Shazam! Blood?

61
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,250
Need to take stiches. Hold it tight.

62
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,625
Now, mumbai has it's own superhero.

63
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:33,375
He seems to have mesmerized the youth.

64
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:36,500
Police is labeling him as criminal...

65
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:40,875
People just love you, chief.

66
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,875
You just wait.

67
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I will make a suit that can withstand
not just a bullet but a missile.

68
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:48,500
World may not have
seen such powerful suit.

69
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:58,750
I had increased MHG42 concentration.

70
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
But it seems to have failed.

71
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,375
But it seems to have failed.

72
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:04,625
Having a powerful suit isn't enough.

73
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
The real strength should
flow through blood in my veins.

74
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:15,500
I am sure it exists somewhere.

75
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:29,000
"This is an archaic
saga of mountain Anjanadri,"

76
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:33,875
"King Kesari's wife prayed day and night,
in desire of having a baby."

77
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:37,250
"Her prayers were answered
and she was blessed with a mighty child"

78
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:44,125
"by the Wind-God, later known
as Anjani's son or Pawan's son."

79
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:55,875
"At the daybreak,
the child mistook rising Sun as a fruit."

80
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
"He jumped towards the Sun"

81
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,875
"He jumped towards the Sun"

82
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:03,875
"and quickly swallowed it."

83
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:06,500
"The world was engulfed with darkness,
as the child swallowed the Sun-God."

84
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:17,125
"Indradev rushed on his
elephant to stop the child."

85
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:22,500
"And aimed at the child with his 'Vajra'"

86
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:27,625
"that pricked Pawan-God's son Hanuman."

87
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:33,000
"A drop of his blood fell deep"

88
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,625
"in the ocean, safely landed in an oyster."

89
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:46,375
"With passing time,"

90
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:49,125
"that drop of blood is transformed
into 'Rudhiramani' (a gem),"

91
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,750
"Rested deep below the ocean,"

92
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:54,375
"the gem is awaiting a true
warrior from past thousands of years."

93
00:12:54,500 --> 00:13:00,000
"The gem is awaiting a
warrior from thousands of years."

94
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,375
"The gem is awaiting a
warrior from thousands of years."

95
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:21,875
I haven't taken morning breakfast yet.

96
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,375
I'm famished.

97
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,125
Wow! Fresh mangoes!

98
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:27,375
Where's it?

99
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,375
Where has it gone?

100
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:32,125
Huh, has he come again?

101
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:42,833
Did you get no one in the village to bother?

102
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:46,625
You are a human and you are bothering a monkey.

103
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:07,041
The next mango is mine.

104
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:09,375
Come on! Come on!

105
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:18,000
Being a human, will you trouble a monkey?

106
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,125
Aren't you ashamed?

107
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:25,750
This last one is surely mine.

108
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:36,875
I will definitely take revenge for this.

109
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:45,625
Brother Hanumant.

110
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:46,875
Take this.

111
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,375
Yeah!

112
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:53,125
Hanumant,
Gajapati's men are beating up Kashi.

113
00:15:57,875 --> 00:16:00,000
Stop it, rogues. May you rot in hell!

114
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,750
Stop it, rogues. May you rot in hell!

115
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:03,500
May you get ruined!

116
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:06,750
You bought many buffaloes
and sold the milk.

117
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:08,625
Had a good income.

118
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:11,000
Now, who will pay the tax?

119
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:14,875
Why should I pay you any tax, Chaman?

120
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:17,750
Did you cater to the cattle?
Have you looked after them?

121
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:19,750
What have you done?

122
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:21,875
You're just living
on our hard earned money.

123
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,500
I'm ready to pay the tax.

124
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:27,000
Actually, I bought 5 buffaloes
but only one conceived.

125
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,500
Now, you're the only hope I have.

126
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:31,250
What do you mean?

127
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:33,375
How am I going to help
your buffalo conceive?

128
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,375
What do you think of me?

129
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,250
Mind your language.

130
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:37,500
Immerse him in water.

131
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:43,875
Is there anyone to save my son?

132
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:47,625
I've come, grandma.

133
00:16:58,375 --> 00:16:59,875
Before touching him,

134
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,875
you should have checked his backbone.

135
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,750
Listen, spare them.

136
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:08,750
Don't worry, I won't kill them.

137
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:11,000
Hey.

138
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,125
Oh no!

139
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:22,000
Fragile bone.

140
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:25,500
Will you challenge this sturdy guy?

141
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:27,500
-Oh God!
-I had warned you.

142
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:29,250
Now, see the outcome.
Have you come to senses now?

143
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,875
Try to understand.
I was just testing their might.

144
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,000
Now watch how I beat them black and blue.

145
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:38,625
-Only if you survive.
-Oh no!

146
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:48,125
Oh no! My cowshed!

147
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:50,375
-What are you doing?
-Take away this calf.

148
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:53,000
Please, leave this calf,
it's my only income source now.

149
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:54,750
Please, don't take it away.

150
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,625
-Let's go.
-Listen...

151
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:59,500
Listen to me. Today is its birthday.

152
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:03,375
Stop boasting at me now.

153
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,125
Good for nothing.

154
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:08,375
I've incurred a huge loss today.

155
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:11,750
Useless fellow!
Yes, that you are.

156
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:14,250
What do I do now?
Pay taxes or repair the cowshed?

157
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:16,750
And without the calf, I'm all alone now.

158
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,875
I know I'm not a strong fighter,

159
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:21,375
-but I am a smart thief.
-Boasting again!

160
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:25,750
Did you loot the looters?

161
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:28,500
Now, sell this and pay off your dues.

162
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:30,625
I admit you're a true hero.

163
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,375
Okay, let's deliver the
milk to the principal's house.

164
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:36,000
Why me? You go.

165
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,625
It didn't click you. Right?

166
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:40,500
Notice the change in your surroundings.

167
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:45,125
His grand-daughter is coming back.

168
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,250
That's why he has ordered extra milk.

169
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:52,625
-You mean Meenakshi?
-Yes.

170
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:54,500
-Why didn't you tell me this before?
-Let's go.

171
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,750
"These flowers..."

172
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:33,750
"These flowers have bestowed blessings."

173
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:35,375
"This heart is blooming"

174
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,875
"with the flowers."

175
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,125
"These flowers..."

176
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:43,000
"These flowers have bestowed blessings."

177
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,500
"She should know, I'm mesmerized,"

178
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:46,375
"by these flowers."

179
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:52,375
"You may forget or shy away from talking."

180
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:58,500
"This heart will always
adore your sweetness."

181
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,625
"I've always met you in my memories."

182
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:39,250
"Every time your eyelids flip,"

183
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:42,375
"my heart skips a beat."

184
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:48,500
"Are we destined to meet in this life?"

185
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:54,125
"Your smile makes my life
as colourful as the butterfly."

186
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:58,375
"I'm puzzled,
are you some riddle or a bunch of aroma?"

187
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,000
"I'm all lost in you."

188
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,875
"I'm all lost in you."

189
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,875
"This world seems beautiful to me,
when you're around."

190
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:11,125
"You may forget or
shy away from admitting."

191
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:17,375
"This heart will always
adore your sweet gestures."

192
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:23,125
"I've always met you in my memories."

193
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:57,500
"I've become your patient."

194
00:21:57,625 --> 00:22:00,000
"How do I get over this fever?"

195
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,625
"How do I get over this fever?"

196
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:03,625
"You're my illness and you're the remedy."

197
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:06,750
"Only you can cure my disease."

198
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:10,000
"When you walk through these lanes,"

199
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:12,500
"I feel at sway."

200
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:14,000
"Now, only you can give assurance,"

201
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,125
"to this wandering heart."

202
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,625
"I'm ready to adapt any change."

203
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:21,875
"Don't give me that look, sweetheart."

204
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:24,500
"Do not forget the childhood friendship."

205
00:22:37,875 --> 00:22:39,375
"These flowers..."

206
00:22:39,375 --> 00:22:42,375
"These flowers have bestowed blessings."

207
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,000
"This heart is blooming"

208
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,500
"with the flowers."

209
00:22:47,125 --> 00:22:52,125
"You may forget or
shy away from admitting."

210
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:58,250
"This heart will always
adore your sweet gesture."

211
00:22:59,375 --> 00:23:00,000
"I've always met you in my memories."

212
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,250
"I've always met you in my memories."

213
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:13,500
Couldn't you find any other
girl for marriage? Let's go.

214
00:23:27,125 --> 00:23:29,375
What's the use of such education?

215
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:31,125
You're so stubborn.

216
00:23:31,375 --> 00:23:34,875
Aunt, several times I've
told you to inform the other party

217
00:23:34,875 --> 00:23:36,250
before initiating talks.

218
00:23:36,375 --> 00:23:39,750
Look at her attitude!

219
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:44,625
Oh I see! Once again the
boy's party have disappointed us.

220
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,250
Only I tolerate her bitter language.

221
00:23:47,375 --> 00:23:48,375
Nobody else can.

222
00:23:48,375 --> 00:23:51,375
Before passing that remark,
you better work on your language.

223
00:23:51,375 --> 00:23:52,875
You get that?

224
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,750
Being her brother,
even I avoid agitating her.

225
00:23:55,875 --> 00:23:57,750
How can we expect Suryakant to marry her?

226
00:23:58,375 --> 00:23:59,750
Don't cross your limit.

227
00:23:59,875 --> 00:24:00,000
You better reason

228
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,875
You better reason

229
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,625
this freeloader.

230
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:03,625
Lazy guy! Good for nothing.

231
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:06,000
Such simple food.

232
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:07,625
But spicy attitude.

233
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,625
Be grateful for even this.
Now, eat quietly.

234
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,500
You started again?

235
00:24:12,625 --> 00:24:15,000
Aunt, there are only
two ways to get her married.

236
00:24:15,125 --> 00:24:17,125
First, she shouldn't talk before marriage,

237
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:18,125
which is next to impossible.

238
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:21,250
Second, let's find her a deaf guy.

239
00:24:21,375 --> 00:24:22,250
Just shut up!

240
00:24:22,375 --> 00:24:23,875
You're responsible for this.

241
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
-Had you taken the responsibilities...
-Why are you shouting?

242
00:24:26,125 --> 00:24:27,125
Huh?!

243
00:24:28,375 --> 00:24:30,750
Finished your chores? Now, get going.

244
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:31,875
I see.

245
00:24:31,875 --> 00:24:34,375
You can say anything to your brother.

246
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,500
But if I say something,
you wouldn't like it.

247
00:24:36,625 --> 00:24:38,125
Go to hell! I care a damn!

248
00:24:38,625 --> 00:24:42,375
Listen, Lakshmi said she
lost her watch in the funfair.

249
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,375
Have you taken it?

250
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,500
Who told her to boast about her new watch?
This was bound to happen.

251
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Why everybody doubts me?

252
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,875
Hey, sister, stop.

253
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,875
Actually, it had stopped.

254
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,500
So, I thought of repairing
it and return to her.

255
00:24:59,125 --> 00:25:00,000
-You won't reform, will you? Will you?
-Sister.

256
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:00,875
-You won't reform, will you? Will you?
-Sister.

257
00:25:00,875 --> 00:25:01,750
-Stop hitting me.
-I've told you

258
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:03,125
to stop indulging in all this.

259
00:25:03,125 --> 00:25:04,625
But you won't do anything
productive in life.

260
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:05,625
She started again.

261
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:07,500
Your friend is also
selling milk for a living.

262
00:25:07,625 --> 00:25:09,250
But you wouldn't think of earning,
will you?

263
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:20,750
He snatched away my food
and relishing meal at home.

264
00:25:23,625 --> 00:25:25,250
What is he upto?

265
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,125
Is he looting in his own house?

266
00:25:34,125 --> 00:25:35,875
Such a nerd! He can't even open the lid.

267
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:38,500
Everybody accuse us for
any kind of theft in the village.

268
00:25:38,625 --> 00:25:39,875
I am ashamed.

269
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,000
Wonder what enmity he has with me.

270
00:25:48,875 --> 00:25:51,125
Am I weak or she is powerful?

271
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,875
Hurry up, man. How long will you take?

272
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,166
Oh, so you're stealing money.
Give me some.

273
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:09,583
Sister. Look. What he is doing?

274
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:13,375
Hero, pay tax from the
money you've just stolen.

275
00:26:13,625 --> 00:26:14,625
Which money?

276
00:26:14,625 --> 00:26:16,500
The same that you've
stolen from the kitchen.

277
00:26:17,125 --> 00:26:18,875
Me? What are you saying?

278
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
My sister is accusing me of theft?

279
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,875
It seems somebody has a bad day today.

280
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,250
-Don't forget to pay tax.
-Yes.

281
00:26:42,125 --> 00:26:44,875
As per the tradition of Anjanadi village,

282
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:50,500
Seemadri has challenged

283
00:26:50,625 --> 00:26:57,875
our Anjanadri's protector,
Gajapati, the warrior.

284
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:14,875
10 years ago, his father
had challenged Gajapati and died.

285
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,125
It's his turn now.

286
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:19,500
Seemadri.

287
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:22,750
Please, don't do anything to my son.

288
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,500
Please, let go off him, brother.

289
00:27:38,125 --> 00:27:40,625
Please, don't do anything to my son.

290
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:44,000
We will leave this village forever.

291
00:27:46,375 --> 00:27:48,750
-Mom!
-Seemadri.

292
00:27:55,125 --> 00:27:57,375
-What happened? What happened to her?
-Oh God!

293
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,750
He seems to have internal injuries.

294
00:28:26,875 --> 00:28:28,250
Need to take him to
the hospital right away.

295
00:28:28,375 --> 00:28:29,625
Get the cart ready.

296
00:28:32,375 --> 00:28:34,125
Long live, Gajapati.

297
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:36,000
Long live, Gajapati.

298
00:28:36,125 --> 00:28:37,625
Long live, Gajapati.

299
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:41,000
Long live, Gajapati.

300
00:28:41,125 --> 00:28:44,375
-Long live, Gajapati.
-Why are you praising him?

301
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,625
For killing innocent people
in the name of wrestling?

302
00:28:47,875 --> 00:28:51,125
Are you condemning
our village's protector?

303
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:53,625
Understand the rules of this village.

304
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,500
Protector? What is a protector?

305
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,875
There was a time, when the protector
protected us from the dacoits.

306
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,625
But have you seen any
dacoits in the village now?

307
00:29:05,875 --> 00:29:07,125
Have you seen them?

308
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,000
Have you?

309
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,375
When there's no danger,
what are you paying taxes for?

310
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,250
Do you see her love for villagers?

311
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,000
She's a large hearted woman.
As large as ocean.

312
00:29:28,125 --> 00:29:29,625
Get drowned in that ocean.

313
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,250
Never object the rules
already set by the elders.

314
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:42,250
You're here on vacation.
So, enjoy your stay and go back.

315
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:44,250
Rules must change with time.

316
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:49,000
This village needs an elected leader,
and not any protector.

317
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:53,750
Hurry up,
quickly take him to the hospital.

318
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,375
Come, dear.

319
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,625
-Veera swami.
-Yes.

320
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,375
I can foresee revolt in the village.

321
00:30:03,625 --> 00:30:05,375
You must take action.

322
00:30:09,125 --> 00:30:10,375
Don't touch me.

323
00:30:11,125 --> 00:30:12,375
Get lost.

324
00:30:12,875 --> 00:30:14,125
What are you doing?

325
00:30:14,875 --> 00:30:17,125
Hey, what are you doing?

326
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:21,250
No, don't do that, please. Stop!

-Mom.
-You can't pay tax.

328
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,875
But you want a hospital?

329
00:30:33,875 --> 00:30:36,250
No, please don't do this.

330
00:30:36,375 --> 00:30:38,000
This fund is for the hospital.

331
00:30:38,125 --> 00:30:40,625
It's sin to steal money from the temple.

332
00:30:41,875 --> 00:30:45,500
If anyone tries to condemn the protector
or refuse to pay tax,

333
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:48,000
he will pay a heavy price for it.

336

By the grace of God, Seemadri is fine now.

Yes.

Well, you don't eat
much but I am a gobbler.

339
00:32:07,875 --> 00:32:09,375
As of now, you're made of silver.

340
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,125
But the moment Meenakshi wears you,

341
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:13,125
you will turn as precious as gold.

342

Please, check all your belongings.

346

His hands are like a magnet.

Useless!

-Isn't he Hanumant?
-You're right.

349
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:46,500
Neither the village,
nor the villagers have changed.

350
00:32:48,625 --> 00:32:49,750
What's the matter, sister?

351
00:32:49,875 --> 00:32:52,250
Do you allow any tom,
dick and harry to board the bus?

352
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:53,250
Hey, boy, get off the bus.

353
00:32:53,375 --> 00:32:54,375
-Throw him out.
-Stop the bus.

Get off I say. Let's go.

357
00:33:11,625 --> 00:33:13,125
You need to be careful
while traveling in a bus.

358

You can bump into many thieves like him.

ever be able to stand up.

But why did she leave?

433
00:49:01,875 --> 00:49:03,875
Somebody risked his life
and saved her yesterday.

434
00:49:03,875 --> 00:49:04,875
She thought it was you.

435
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,875
-Of course, it was me.
-So, where are your injuries?

436
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,125
It is healed.

437
00:49:08,250 --> 00:49:11,250
Are you a magician to
heal your wounds yourself?

438

-I mean it.
- Shut up. Cheater.

Spare me from your lies.

Aren't you ashamed?

468

Ladies, huh? Are you in love?

477
00:51:15,125 --> 00:51:16,750
You can say so.

Okay, I give you.
But you need to play a game with me.

00:51:40,625 --> 00:51:42,250
Why risk our life?

488
00:51:42,375 --> 00:51:44,375
They are proud of their might.

489
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:46,625
And they are misusing it.

490
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:50,500
Hey, stop.

491
00:51:50,666 --> 00:51:51,791
Are you enjoying it?

492
00:51:51,875 --> 00:51:54,250
They need to be given a befitting reply.

493
00:51:54,625 --> 00:51:57,250
-Are you a Romeo?
- Let me go.

494
00:51:57,250 --> 00:51:58,625
Pandavas got Bheema in thier group.

495
00:51:58,750 --> 00:52:00,000
Yadavs got Balram.

496
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:00,125
Yadavs got Balram.

497
00:52:00,375 --> 00:52:02,000
This Anjanadri needs Hanuman.

498
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:19,500
He flew away.

499
00:52:22,250 --> 00:52:23,750
Yeah!

500
00:52:34,625 --> 00:52:36,500
Looks like he ate
some power booster today.

501
00:52:38,250 --> 00:52:41,000
Hit him! Hit him! Break his bones.

502
00:52:42,625 --> 00:52:44,500
It is an unlucky day today.

503
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:47,625
Caught you.

504
00:52:51,125 --> 00:52:52,875
How did this... how did this get twisted?

505
00:52:53,250 --> 00:52:55,000
Let me help.

506
00:52:58,750 --> 00:53:00,000
Do you want them twisted?

507
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:00,250
Do you want them twisted?

508
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,250
Okay, fine.

509
00:53:05,875 --> 00:53:07,875
Listen, I will readjust them, wait.

510
00:53:10,125 --> 00:53:11,000
What's wrong with him?

511
00:53:11,125 --> 00:53:12,375
Must be playing hide and seek.

512
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:18,750
-Who did this?
- You've broken them.

513
00:53:20,125 --> 00:53:22,000
-Have I?
- Yes.

514
00:53:22,750 --> 00:53:24,875
Come on, hit him.

515
00:53:28,125 --> 00:53:29,375
What is he doing?

516
00:53:57,625 --> 00:54:00,000
"He is the true Superhero."

517
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:00,500
"He is the true Superhero."

518
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:04,250
“No one can match Hanuman’s powers”

519
00:54:04,375 --> 00:54:08,000
It seems he's possessed. Let's run away.

520
00:54:12,375 --> 00:54:15,000
Return my chain if you
want your other hand's safety.

521
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:33,125
Where has he gone?

522
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:49,875
Who has beaten them blue?

523
00:54:50,375 --> 00:54:51,625
Hi!

524
00:54:52,375 --> 00:54:54,875
His! Him! That!

525
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:57,000
Everybody! I've beaten them.

526
00:54:57,125 --> 00:54:59,500
-You?!
- Yes, want a surprise?

527
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:01,875
Where's it?

528
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,375
Where's the chain?

529
00:55:03,625 --> 00:55:04,625
Have it lost it again?

530
00:55:05,750 --> 00:55:07,000
Where it must have gone?

531
00:55:07,625 --> 00:55:09,125
-I've taken my revenge.
- Hey.

532
00:55:09,250 --> 00:55:10,750
It's with that monkey. Look there.

533
00:55:11,250 --> 00:55:13,000
I don't have anything.

534
00:55:14,625 --> 00:55:17,250
I'm not a fool. Stop boasting.

535
00:55:17,875 --> 00:55:21,250
I swear, I've beaten them black and blue.

536
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:22,750
Didn't you witness it, children?

537
00:55:22,750 --> 00:55:26,125
-Yes, sister.
-Aren't you ashamed?

538
00:55:26,250 --> 00:55:27,500
Don't train children to speak lies.

539
00:55:27,625 --> 00:55:28,875
I can prove.

540
00:55:29,125 --> 00:55:30,750
Wait and watch! She will be awestruck now.

541
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:33,375
Shall I pluck the fruit
without climbing on the tree?

542
00:55:34,125 --> 00:55:36,625
Watch out! I'm on the tree.

543
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,125
It seems his power button has turned off.

544
00:56:01,250 --> 00:56:02,375
Listen!

545
00:56:03,250 --> 00:56:04,500
Meenakshi.

546
00:56:16,625 --> 00:56:18,250
Where's it?

547
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:20,125
It must be here.

548
00:56:20,750 --> 00:56:23,750
Sister, did you see
some thing bright and red?

549
00:56:24,125 --> 00:56:25,750
Smoulders are burning. Want some?

550
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:27,625
No, thanks.

551
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,375
Where it must be?

552
00:56:37,250 --> 00:56:38,375
Found it.

553
00:56:45,250 --> 00:56:46,625
Abracadabra!

554
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:49,250
Glory to the Maheshmati!

555
00:56:49,375 --> 00:56:50,750
Glory to Bajarang Bali.

556
00:56:50,875 --> 00:56:52,375
Glory to the Lord Rama!

557
00:56:55,875 --> 00:56:59,125
I will find the secret
behind this magical power.

558
00:57:01,125 --> 00:57:04,750
Goddess! Listen to my prayers!

559
00:57:04,875 --> 00:57:05,750
Appear, Goddess!

560
00:57:05,875 --> 00:57:07,500
My life is in Your hands now.

561
00:57:07,625 --> 00:57:08,750
Appear before me.

562
00:57:08,875 --> 00:57:10,000
Is she here?!

563
00:57:12,375 --> 00:57:13,375
Sister?!

564
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:15,750
I thought you've recovered
with Goddess' blessings.

565
00:57:15,875 --> 00:57:17,125
But you're indulged into sorcery.

566
00:57:17,250 --> 00:57:19,125
Stop there, you idiot.
I won't spare you today.

567
00:57:19,250 --> 00:57:20,250
No, sister, don't hit me.

568
00:57:20,375 --> 00:57:23,125
When I saw the broken walls,
I had a doubt.

569
00:57:23,875 --> 00:57:25,375
-It's hurting me, sister.
- Come back I say.

570
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:27,625
Doesn't matter.
You will come back some time.

571
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:31,750
Will you trap me, Mr. Gem?

572
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:33,875
Nice name.

573
00:57:34,125 --> 00:57:35,750
Henceforth, I will call you Mr. Gem.

574
00:57:36,250 --> 00:57:39,000
If you had empowered me once,
what was the need to withdraw that power?

575
00:57:39,125 --> 00:57:41,375
You've embarrassed
me in front of Meenakshi?

576
00:57:41,625 --> 00:57:43,750
Earlier I was just a thief in her eyes,

577
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,125
but thanks to you,
now she thinks I am a conman.

578
00:57:46,375 --> 00:57:49,375
Why did you ruin my life,
before it settles down?

579
00:57:49,750 --> 00:57:51,000
Why?

580
00:58:08,375 --> 00:58:09,750
It's shining now.

581
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:36,125
I've love my buffalo more than anything.

582
00:58:36,125 --> 00:58:38,125
But you don't give enough milk

583
00:58:38,250 --> 00:58:39,625
compared to the fodder you eat.

584
00:58:39,750 --> 00:58:41,875
-Kashi, see this.
- You're my buffalo.

585
00:58:41,875 --> 00:58:43,000
He has come to bore me again.

586
00:58:43,125 --> 00:58:44,375
I've found this gem.

587
00:58:44,375 --> 00:58:46,875
-It's not an ordinary gem.
- As if you found the Kohinoor.

588
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,500
Stop acting now. And look at this.

589
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,375
This has got magical powers.

590
00:58:50,875 --> 00:58:52,500
That's why I had
recovered in just one day.

591
00:58:52,625 --> 00:58:54,000
And it made me powerful, too.

592
00:58:54,375 --> 00:58:56,375
Like Shaktiman! Superman!

593
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:58,125
Do you think I am a fool?

594
00:58:58,125 --> 00:59:00,000
I'm class four pass out. Don't fool me.

595
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:00,500
I'm class four pass out. Don't fool me.

596
00:59:00,625 --> 00:59:02,750
What?!
You don't believe me? Wait.

597
00:59:22,750 --> 00:59:24,000
Do you believe now?

598
00:59:24,625 --> 00:59:25,875
It's not a big deal.

599
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,375
Bahubali had also picked
up the 'Shivling' (idol of Shiva).

600
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:30,250
Show me something new.

601
00:59:45,125 --> 00:59:46,625
Copied again.

602
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:49,500
This is Mahesh Babu's style!
He has done it in many films.

603
00:59:49,625 --> 00:59:51,250
Show me something new.

604
01:00:01,375 --> 01:00:03,250
Not a big deal.

605
01:00:03,875 --> 01:00:08,375
Mithun has been doing
this since childhood.

606
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:25,000
Come on, this is what superheroes do.

607
01:00:25,125 --> 01:00:27,375
But our heroes do this in every film.

608
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:31,625
If you want me to believe
in your magical powers,

609
01:00:31,750 --> 01:00:33,000
then do something bigger.

610
01:00:33,125 --> 01:00:34,000
Increase the intensity
of your power. Can you?

611
01:00:34,125 --> 01:00:36,750
-Bigger than this?
-I'm a Rajani fan.

612
01:00:36,875 --> 01:00:38,125
Super star Rajnikant.

613
01:00:38,125 --> 01:00:41,250
He can even stop a train
by showing his finger.

614
01:00:41,375 --> 01:00:43,250
You tell me, can you do that?

615
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,375
Hanumant, don't be adamant. Let's go.

616
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:53,750
This looks good in films.

617
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:55,875
If something happens to you,
sister will kill me.

618
01:00:56,625 --> 01:00:58,375
Move away, please.

619
01:01:06,750 --> 01:01:08,625
Hey, the train is speeding.

620
01:01:10,375 --> 01:01:13,125
Glory to Rajani Dev.

621
01:01:13,125 --> 01:01:14,875
Empower me!

622
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,750
Glory to Rajani Dev.

623
01:01:23,125 --> 01:01:24,750
Train is getting closer.

624
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:29,625
Hanumant, you will die. Don't do this.
Don't do this, friend.

625
01:01:29,750 --> 01:01:33,000
Hey, no. Somebody, please save me.

626
01:01:33,125 --> 01:01:34,375
You will die.

627
01:01:40,375 --> 01:01:43,875
Hanumant! You've left me.

628
01:01:49,250 --> 01:01:53,000
My friend Hanumant is no more!

629
01:01:57,500 --> 01:01:58,500
-Hanumant!
- Yes.

630
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:00,000
Even after the collision,
you're still in single piece?

631
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:00,500
Even after the collision,
you're still in single piece?

632
01:02:00,625 --> 01:02:02,125
Do you believe me, now?

633
01:02:02,250 --> 01:02:05,375
You're a superhero. Bigger than Rajni.

634
01:02:05,375 --> 01:02:07,125
Hey, no. He's unbeatable.

635
01:02:07,250 --> 01:02:09,625
-Glory to Rajni God!
-Glory to Rajni God!

636
01:02:15,625 --> 01:02:16,875
Move!

637
01:02:17,125 --> 01:02:19,125
Why don't you get it?
This isn't your nest.

638
01:02:19,750 --> 01:02:21,375
You've pooped twice.

639
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,500
All my earnings gets
used up in buying shampoo.

640
01:02:24,625 --> 01:02:26,125
Hey, birds nest. Look here.

641
01:02:26,250 --> 01:02:29,625
-Give me one banana.
-Get lost.

642
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Will you scare me? Wait and watch.

643
01:02:34,375 --> 01:02:35,375
Are you looking at the chain?

644
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:36,500
Gold chain?

645
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:39,000
He's looking at the chain.
Yes, please look at it.

646
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,625
I'm sure he has stolen it from somewhere.

647
01:02:40,875 --> 01:02:42,625
I will steal it from him.

648
01:02:46,750 --> 01:02:48,000
Get lost. Go.

649
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:54,500
Here you go.

650
01:02:55,375 --> 01:02:56,500
I've fooled this monkey.

651
01:02:56,625 --> 01:02:58,375
-He fooled me.
-Got the chain.

652
01:02:59,250 --> 01:03:00,000
Hey, stop. Return my chain.

653
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:00,750
Hey, stop. Return my chain.

654
01:03:00,750 --> 01:03:03,125
-We will go after the school.
-Okay.

655
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:05,125
Come, buy whatever you want to.

656
01:03:07,875 --> 01:03:09,875
-Give it to me, please.
-Wait.

657
01:03:10,875 --> 01:03:12,000
Take this.

658
01:03:12,125 --> 01:03:13,250
You also take one.

659
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,250
-Give it to me quickly, uncle.
-It's not a lollypop.

660
01:03:16,375 --> 01:03:17,625
-This chain?
-Easy... easy.

661
01:03:17,750 --> 01:03:19,125
How did you get this chain?

662
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:21,875
Is this her chain?

663
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,500
Will you please come out for a minute?

664
01:03:27,625 --> 01:03:29,125
-Well, I...
-If you don't mind.

665
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:31,625
What are you doing?

666
01:03:31,750 --> 01:03:32,875
Why do you unfasten the button?

667
01:03:36,375 --> 01:03:38,625
It's first time for me. I'm feeling shy.

668
01:03:38,750 --> 01:03:40,125
Children, please close your eyes.

669
01:03:41,625 --> 01:03:43,250
Everybody has closed their eyes now.

670
01:03:43,625 --> 01:03:44,750
This wound?

671
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:48,250
Well, it's a dog-bite.

672
01:03:48,375 --> 01:03:49,500
Don't lie.

673
01:03:49,625 --> 01:03:51,625
-Has she understood?
-How long will you hide from me?

674
01:03:51,750 --> 01:03:54,125
No, I am not. I open the shop daily.

675
01:03:54,125 --> 01:03:55,500
Selling things at cheap rate.

676
01:03:55,625 --> 01:03:56,500
Stop acting.

677
01:03:56,625 --> 01:03:58,125
You've been saving
my life all these years.

678
01:03:58,125 --> 01:03:59,875
Then why do you hide the truth?

679
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,750
It seems somebody has saved her life

680
01:04:01,875 --> 01:04:03,375
and she's looking for him.

681
01:04:05,125 --> 01:04:06,500
How could I have?

682
01:04:07,250 --> 01:04:09,000
How can I boast about my powers?

683
01:04:09,375 --> 01:04:11,000
Love means sacrifice.

684
01:04:11,750 --> 01:04:15,250
How could I have taken
the credit of saving your life?

685
01:04:19,250 --> 01:04:21,250
I sell groceries.

686
01:04:21,625 --> 01:04:24,250
But I can't sell emotions.

687
01:04:24,875 --> 01:04:26,250
It seems she's impressed.

688
01:04:27,125 --> 01:04:29,125
Here's your chain. Keep it.

689
01:04:30,250 --> 01:04:32,250
-Thank you.
-Welcome!

690
01:04:38,625 --> 01:04:40,125
Walk fast, we've to explain everything to

691
01:04:40,250 --> 01:04:41,750
-Meenakshi before the sunset.
-Why so?

692
01:04:41,750 --> 01:04:43,875
Because the gem losenligs
its powers after the sunset.

693
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,625
Oh I see. That means suht
is the source of its energy.

694
01:04:46,750 --> 01:04:48,750
-Meenu.
-Hey.

695
01:04:48,750 --> 01:04:51,250
Don't worry, Meenu.
I slipped in your love.

696
01:04:54,375 --> 01:04:56,750
I thought there's
an animal with Meenakshi.

697
01:04:56,875 --> 01:04:58,125
What is she doing with this wild animal?

698
01:04:58,250 --> 01:05:00,000
See, I found my saviour,
who saved me that day.

699
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,125
See, I found my saviour,
who saved me that day.

700
01:05:01,375 --> 01:05:02,875
She's talking about you.

701
01:05:03,125 --> 01:05:05,375
It's him. Guddeshwar Rao.

702
01:05:06,250 --> 01:05:07,750
-He?!
-Yes, of course.

703
01:05:07,875 --> 01:05:09,500
What?
You don't believe him?

704
01:05:09,625 --> 01:05:12,000
-Wait, I will show you.
-Let me do that honour.

705
01:05:12,125 --> 01:05:14,000
See this. See this.
You also see.

706
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,250
He can't miss his target even in darkness.

707
01:05:17,250 --> 01:05:18,125
Absolutely.

708
01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:21,500
A bird fells on its own,
before I pick up my slingshot.

709
01:05:21,625 --> 01:05:22,875
Am I right, Meenu?

710
01:05:23,375 --> 01:05:24,750
Really? Show me now.

711
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,125
But I'm not carrying my slingshot.

712
01:05:27,125 --> 01:05:28,875
Don't worry, I've it. Here you go.

713
01:05:28,875 --> 01:05:30,000
-Okay, show it now.
-Take it.

714
01:05:30,125 --> 01:05:31,250
Go ahead.

715
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:36,375
Gunu, prove your power to them. Come on.

716
01:05:36,375 --> 01:05:38,000
Okay, but what's the target?

717
01:05:38,125 --> 01:05:39,875
That coconut.

718
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,875
-It's very far.
-Shall I bring it in your lap?

719
01:05:42,875 --> 01:05:44,375
Let it be. Yes, I will.
-Aim now.

720
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:49,125
Using a slingshot is
not everybody's cup of tea.

721
01:05:49,250 --> 01:05:50,500
Keep watching.

722
01:05:50,875 --> 01:05:52,875
In the name of God!

723
01:05:57,375 --> 01:05:58,625
Uncle Ranga?!

724
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,000
Poison?!

725
01:06:07,625 --> 01:06:10,500
-What were you doing?
-I was left with no choice.

726
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:14,125
They seized my crop in the name of tax.

727
01:06:14,250 --> 01:06:15,500
Whatever little saving I had,

728
01:06:15,625 --> 01:06:17,375
they snatched it away as well.

729
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:21,500
They've instilled fear
in us by their dacoity,

730
01:06:21,625 --> 01:06:23,750
and made us their slave.

731
01:06:24,125 --> 01:06:28,000
If we protest,
they kill us in the name of wrestling.

732
01:06:28,875 --> 01:06:31,500
I've no courage to fight them.

733
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:33,500
So, it's better to end my life.

734
01:06:40,625 --> 01:06:43,750
Dacoits and robbers only
loot jewelries and money.

735
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:46,000
But you're snatching
away food from the villagers.

736
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:48,125
You're worst than the dacoits.

737
01:06:48,250 --> 01:06:52,125
Girl, Anjanadri's
tradition is unalterable.

738
01:06:53,500 --> 01:06:56,750
If you've any objection,
ring the bell and challenge me.

739
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
Do the wrestling with me.

740
01:07:05,750 --> 01:07:07,000
What happened?

741
01:07:07,750 --> 01:07:09,375
Why are you quiet now?

742
01:07:13,125 --> 01:07:14,250
Hey.

743
01:07:14,750 --> 01:07:15,750
Wait a minute, sister.

744
01:07:15,875 --> 01:07:17,250
Why do you accept the challenge?

745
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:19,125
We've a suitable guy for that.

746
01:07:19,125 --> 01:07:23,125
Like a barrier, he will stop
any storm heading towards you.

747
01:07:23,625 --> 01:07:26,625
And that daredevil is Guddeshwar Rao.

748
01:07:27,875 --> 01:07:29,500
Leave my hand. Why should I fight?

749
01:07:29,750 --> 01:07:31,250
You wanted to lay your
life for your love, right?

750
01:07:31,250 --> 01:07:33,000
-So go ahead.
-Mind your job, you idiot.

751
01:07:33,125 --> 01:07:35,875
Don't mistaken this fat as your power.
You will lose your life.

752
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,000
I'm not planning to die.

753
01:07:37,125 --> 01:07:39,000
Prove them that this
is your muscle and not fat.

754
01:07:39,125 --> 01:07:40,000
It's fat.

755
01:07:40,125 --> 01:07:41,125
Only fat.

756
01:07:41,250 --> 01:07:43,375
This isn't any feast, that one can enjoy.

757
01:07:43,375 --> 01:07:44,250
It's wrestling, after all.

758
01:07:44,250 --> 01:07:45,625
Have you seen this hippo?

759
01:07:45,875 --> 01:07:46,750
Sorry, sir.

760
01:07:46,750 --> 01:07:48,375
He won't kill me but squeeze me.

761
01:07:48,625 --> 01:07:51,250
Hello, aunt. How did you
believe that I was your saviour?

762
01:07:51,625 --> 01:07:54,125
Actually, the chain was quite pretty
and you are prettier than that.

763
01:07:54,250 --> 01:07:55,000
That's why I got carried away.

764
01:07:55,125 --> 01:07:56,125
It was just pastime for me.

765
01:07:56,125 --> 01:07:57,750
Spare me. I don't want to get beaten up.

766
01:07:57,875 --> 01:07:58,875
This wound.

767
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,750
Let me remove this.
This, too... strip me down.

768
01:08:01,875 --> 01:08:03,375
How many times will you check?

769
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:05,125
I had told you it was a dog-bite.

770
01:08:05,375 --> 01:08:07,250
I'm sorry, sir. See you later.

771
01:08:07,375 --> 01:08:09,000
Come to my shop.
I will give you free biscuits.

772
01:08:09,125 --> 01:08:10,375
Stop, don't run away. Stop.

773
01:08:12,250 --> 01:08:14,500
Come on, girl, come to the arena.

774
01:08:16,375 --> 01:08:20,750
I swear, I'll enjoy fighting with you.

775
01:08:45,125 --> 01:08:46,375
Will there be wrestling again?

776
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,500
Somebody will die today.

777
01:08:55,916 --> 01:08:57,541
Hanumant! You will fight?

778
01:08:57,625 --> 01:08:59,250
Will you fight with me?

779
01:08:59,625 --> 01:09:00,000
You're not even of the size of my leg.

780
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,250
You're not even of the size of my leg.

781
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:03,625
Tell me your last wish.

782
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:07,375
Hanumant,
this isn't any theft but wrestling.

783
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:08,375
Withdraw yourself.

784
01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:12,125
I know both, theft as well as wrestling.

785
01:09:14,875 --> 01:09:16,625
What is he taking out,

786
01:09:17,416 --> 01:09:18,750
Is there anything new?

787
01:09:18,875 --> 01:09:25,000
Sister, you just watch
how he squeezes off Gajapati.

788
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:31,375
Today I will become the
hero in everybody's eyes.

789
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:42,875
Run away, man.

790
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:47,250
It's cloudy now, better run away.

791
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:49,000
Run away now.

792
01:09:55,625 --> 01:09:56,875
Come on.

793
01:10:12,916 --> 01:10:14,708
How much time is he going to waste?

794
01:10:14,708 --> 01:10:16,625
-Come on.
-Wait a minute.

795
01:10:17,125 --> 01:10:18,250
Shall I hit him with this?

796
01:10:24,625 --> 01:10:26,125
Poor guy!

797
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,375
How do I escape now?

798
01:10:34,125 --> 01:10:35,375
How are you?

799
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:36,625
Hi!

800
01:10:37,125 --> 01:10:38,500
Hey... hey...

801
01:10:41,500 --> 01:10:42,625
Listen, Anjana.

802
01:10:42,625 --> 01:10:44,875
Your brother has challenged Gajapati.

803
01:10:44,875 --> 01:10:45,875
Huh?!

804
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,125
Start beating the drums, Nandu.

805
01:10:48,625 --> 01:10:51,375
Today is his last day.

806
01:11:14,625 --> 01:11:15,500
Move!

807
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:18,875
Hey, Hanumant.

808
01:11:20,375 --> 01:11:22,125
Do you want to die?
Let's go back home.

809
01:11:22,125 --> 01:11:24,125
Sister is furious today.

810
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,500
Sister, why did you come here?

811
01:11:30,750 --> 01:11:33,000
He's already a dimwit.
Weren't you in senses?

812
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
-Sun was shining bright at that time.
-What do you mean?

813
01:11:51,750 --> 01:11:53,000
Hanumant!

814
01:11:53,375 --> 01:11:55,000
Somebody please save him.

815
01:12:01,375 --> 01:12:02,875
Sir, please spare him.

816
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:04,625
Pardon him. He's a kid.

817
01:12:05,125 --> 01:12:06,750
He doesn't have any
sense who he has challenged.

818
01:12:06,875 --> 01:12:08,375
Please, spare him.

819
01:12:17,125 --> 01:12:21,000
Both, the power and
the woman are dangerous.

820
01:12:21,750 --> 01:12:25,125
Many idiots take lives for them

821
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:28,625
and many lose their lives for them.

822
01:12:32,125 --> 01:12:34,375
Hanumant!

823
01:12:49,333 --> 01:12:51,458
What was the need to fight?

824
01:13:02,166 --> 01:13:04,291
ohh! lets go

825
01:13:22,875 --> 01:13:25,750
"Lord Ram!"

826
01:13:32,125 --> 01:13:34,500
Hanumant, the sky is clear now.

827
01:13:39,625 --> 01:13:43,000
How come it is so bright?

828

in the South Indian films.

848
01:15:53,375 --> 01:15:55,875
Because he's not a filmy
hero to fight with the goons.

01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:59,125
He's a superhero.

01:17:23,625 --> 01:17:26,750
Hereafter, there will
be no polyguard in the village.

868
01:17:28,625 --> 01:17:33,250
As Meenakshi said,
we will elect our leader by fair election.

869
01:17:33,375 --> 01:17:34,375
That's wonderful.

870
01:17:36,500 --> 01:17:37,500
Very nice.

871
01:17:37,750 --> 01:17:39,875
Hanumant gave us a hope in life.

872
01:18:04,250 --> 01:18:05,875
We hardly see a bus in this village.

873
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,125
How come there's a helicopter?

874
01:19:01,375 --> 01:19:04,625
This is the beginning
of war for the blood-gem.

875
01:19:05,625 --> 01:19:07,250
But where's Hanuman?

"Lord Ram!"

879
01:19:56,625 --> 01:19:58,250
Who are you, sir?

880
01:20:00,375 --> 01:20:01,500
Don't you get it?

881
01:20:01,625 --> 01:20:04,750
They are here for a film shooting.
He's the hero and he's the comedian.

882
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
Comedian? I am a scientist.

883
01:20:07,250 --> 01:20:08,125
What's this?
A scientist.

884
01:20:08,250 --> 01:20:09,375
Their job is to give signature.

885
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:11,875
What's this now?

886
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
Just rich lifestyle.
They don't brush their teeth.

887
01:20:14,125 --> 01:20:16,375
So, they pump in some
fragrance in their mouth.

888
01:20:18,500 --> 01:20:20,250
Check on your teeth first
before commenting on mine.

889
01:20:20,375 --> 01:20:21,500
It's an asthma inhaler.

890
01:20:21,500 --> 01:20:23,250
We too have Asma in our village.

891
01:20:23,375 --> 01:20:25,875
It's asthma. Bloody illiterate.

892
01:20:25,875 --> 01:20:27,125
He's confused.

893
01:20:27,375 --> 01:20:29,250
May I ask you, what brings you here?

894
01:20:40,125 --> 01:20:42,000
Hi, friends!

895
01:20:44,375 --> 01:20:47,875
Chief, this isn't for you. I was just... .

896
01:20:56,125 --> 01:20:57,375
Shazam!

897
01:20:58,125 --> 01:21:00,000
That guy must have been crushed to death.

898
01:21:03,875 --> 01:21:05,125
What the... .

899
01:21:07,125 --> 01:21:09,500
He's not superman, but his godfather.

900
01:21:11,125 --> 01:21:13,125
Remove this video from internet.

901
01:21:15,375 --> 01:21:19,625
My name is Michael.
I assure development in your village.

902
01:21:20,625 --> 01:21:21,875
What will you benefit from that?

903
01:21:22,125 --> 01:21:24,500
It's called corporate
social responsibility.

904
01:21:25,375 --> 01:21:27,375
Usually big companies help the undeveloped

905
01:21:27,500 --> 01:21:29,125
villages by providing
them some basic facilities.

906
01:21:29,625 --> 01:21:30,625
Right.

907
01:21:30,625 --> 01:21:33,250
Does that mean you will fulfill
all the needs of this village?

908
01:21:33,375 --> 01:21:34,375
Exactly.

909
01:21:34,500 --> 01:21:37,500
Do you want metro in the village?
Flyover or airport?

910
01:21:37,875 --> 01:21:39,750
You will get everything you want.
Shazam!

911
01:21:39,875 --> 01:21:42,375
Sir, we yearn for watching movies.

912
01:21:42,375 --> 01:21:43,375
Please, build a cinema hall.

913
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:45,000
Shall I shoot your film?
Back off.

914
01:21:45,750 --> 01:21:47,500
Meenakshi, you please talk to them.

915
01:21:48,375 --> 01:21:51,000
Every year many people die here

916
01:21:51,125 --> 01:21:53,250
due to lack of timely treatment.

917
01:21:53,875 --> 01:21:56,000
To avoid that situation in future,

918
01:21:56,125 --> 01:21:58,625
I wish we've a hospital in Anjanadri.

919
01:21:59,875 --> 01:22:00,000
Want a hospital? Done!

920
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,375
Want a hospital? Done!

921
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:03,625
Boss, we will build
a super specialty hospital.

922
01:22:03,625 --> 01:22:04,625
With helipad.

923
01:22:04,750 --> 01:22:05,875
Will you really build it?

924
01:22:18,750 --> 01:22:20,250
Shazam!

925
01:22:37,375 --> 01:22:38,375
Hey, Siri!

926
01:22:38,750 --> 01:22:39,750
Chief, tell me.

927
01:22:41,125 --> 01:22:43,000
Any clue about the source of his powers?

928
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:44,250
I'm trying to find it, chief.

929
01:22:44,375 --> 01:22:45,750
Will report you by this evening,

930
01:22:45,875 --> 01:22:47,250
with details, as to how he got the powers.

931
01:22:47,375 --> 01:22:50,500
We will go back before
the foundation stone is laid.

932
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:55,375
I will defame you
if you won't pay my dues.

933
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:58,625
Shut up and go to hell.
I won't pay you a single cent.

934
01:22:58,750 --> 01:22:59,875
Do what you can.

935
01:23:00,125 --> 01:23:01,625
Keep that jar back.

936
01:23:01,875 --> 01:23:03,125
Jar thief.

937
01:23:03,250 --> 01:23:05,625
Such weird people are there in village.
Nobody knows.

938
01:23:05,750 --> 01:23:08,750
How do I find out about
Hanumant's super power?

939
01:23:08,875 --> 01:23:10,125
Shall I tell you?

940
01:23:11,250 --> 01:23:12,125
Do you know?

941
01:23:12,125 --> 01:23:13,875
-I've given him the power.
-You?!

942
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:17,000
-I'm also a scientist.
-I don't believe you.

943
01:23:17,250 --> 01:23:19,875
Don't believe.
I've the evidence. I will show you.

944
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:23,125
Stop fooling around people. And get lost.

945
01:23:23,750 --> 01:23:25,625
-Did you call him?
-No, I just met him.

946
01:23:25,750 --> 01:23:27,375
Hey, keep your mouth
shut if you don't know.

947
01:23:27,500 --> 01:23:29,375
And if you really know then
learn to keep it a secret like me.

948
01:23:29,500 --> 01:23:31,250
Hey, do you know?

949
01:23:31,375 --> 01:23:32,875
Hey, no. I don't know anything.

950
01:23:32,875 --> 01:23:35,250
I know that you're aware of it.
Please, tell me.

951
01:23:35,875 --> 01:23:38,500
He had no power until last month.

952
01:23:39,625 --> 01:23:42,750
But a month ago...
. Do you see that woman?

953
01:23:42,875 --> 01:23:44,125
A live power bank?

954
01:23:44,250 --> 01:23:45,375
-Want a sweet?
-Yes.

955
01:23:45,500 --> 01:23:46,625
Why should I give you?

956
01:23:46,750 --> 01:23:48,500
He embraced her tightly.

957
01:23:48,500 --> 01:23:50,125
And kissed her.

958
01:23:50,250 --> 01:23:52,125
After that he became so powerful

959
01:23:52,250 --> 01:23:55,125
that he squeezed all the wrestlers.

960
01:23:55,500 --> 01:23:57,375
-I mean it.
-I don't believe you.

961
01:23:57,500 --> 01:23:59,250
One would lose all
his powers by kissing her.

962
01:23:59,375 --> 01:24:00,000
And you said, she will give power?

963
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:00,750
And you said, she will give power?

964
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:02,250
You're not getting it.

965
01:24:02,375 --> 01:24:03,625
Few things spread with the touch.

966
01:24:03,750 --> 01:24:06,375
You just kiss her once
and take all the powers.

967
01:24:06,375 --> 01:24:07,625
Oh my God!

968
01:24:07,875 --> 01:24:09,375
I think she's kind of like a witch.

969
01:24:10,375 --> 01:24:11,500
A scarlet witch.

970
01:24:11,625 --> 01:24:14,250
Yes, sir.
Not any ordinary witch. But sandwich.

971
01:24:14,625 --> 01:24:15,625
-Thank you.
-Wait a minute.

972
01:24:15,750 --> 01:24:16,875
Why do you go to kiss her?

973
01:24:16,875 --> 01:24:17,875
You will get the power.

974
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,500
-That's the idea.
-Stop. Think again.

975
01:24:19,500 --> 01:24:22,375
-You will get overpowered.
-Shut up. I want that power.

976
01:24:22,625 --> 01:24:23,875
Barber shop!

977
01:24:24,750 --> 01:24:26,000
This won't help with bad odour.

978
01:24:26,125 --> 01:24:27,125
Wait, I will give you fennel seeds.

979
01:24:27,250 --> 01:24:29,125
This is asthma... . leave it. Dimwit.

980
01:24:31,250 --> 01:24:32,500
Now, he will get beaten. Yes.

981
01:24:32,625 --> 01:24:34,250
Run away from here. Go... . get lost.

982
01:24:39,500 --> 01:24:40,875
-Hey... .

983
01:24:41,500 --> 01:24:43,125
Will you eve-tease? Will you?

984
01:24:43,125 --> 01:24:44,250
I won't spare you.

985
01:24:44,375 --> 01:24:45,375
Wait a minute.

986
01:24:47,750 --> 01:24:48,750
I'm trying it since this morning.

987
01:24:48,875 --> 01:24:50,750
Shazam! But no clue.

988
01:24:54,875 --> 01:24:57,250
Excuse me, what's happening here?

989
01:24:57,375 --> 01:24:59,875
Hanumant will tell us
the secret of his power today.

990
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:02,250
Damn!

991
01:25:02,625 --> 01:25:04,125
Shazam!

992
01:25:06,250 --> 01:25:10,125
You all are wondering how I
have managed to beat Gajapati, right?

993
01:25:10,250 --> 01:25:11,250
Yes.

994
01:25:11,500 --> 01:25:15,750
Secret of my power is Kashi's milk.

995
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
-My milk?
-I mean, his buffalo's milk.

996
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,750
Stop fooling around. Shazam!

997
01:25:20,875 --> 01:25:23,125
-You don't believe me, do you?
-Not at all.

998
01:25:35,625 --> 01:25:37,250
Form a queue. Form a queue, please.

999
01:25:37,375 --> 01:25:38,625
One by one.

1000
01:25:38,750 --> 01:25:39,625
Thank you, friend.

1001
01:25:39,625 --> 01:25:42,125
You're a true friend.
You've settled my business.

1002
01:25:42,250 --> 01:25:45,250
Pay me 25% of your profit.

1003
01:25:46,500 --> 01:25:47,875
Gajapati was way better than you.

1004
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:49,125
He never charged me more than 10%.

1005
01:25:49,250 --> 01:25:50,875
Kashi, give me 5 liters of milk.

1006
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
-Pay first.
-Here you go. Rs.100.

1007
01:25:53,125 --> 01:25:54,125
I'm paying you hundred thousand rupees.

1008
01:25:54,125 --> 01:25:55,625
Hey... Back off.

1009
01:25:55,750 --> 01:25:57,750
You won't give this milk to anyone.

1010
01:25:57,875 --> 01:25:59,875
I will buy all of it.

1011
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:00,875
Out! Out!

1012
01:26:00,875 --> 01:26:01,875
Shazam!

1013
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:03,750
-Here you go, sir.
-Thank you.

1014
01:26:21,375 --> 01:26:22,500
Welcome.

1015
01:26:25,375 --> 01:26:26,375
What's up?

1016
01:26:26,500 --> 01:26:27,625
What's going on?

1017
01:26:27,750 --> 01:26:29,250
Please, offer this coconut for

1018
01:26:29,375 --> 01:26:32,250
the foundation laying
ceremony of the hospital.

1019
01:26:42,750 --> 01:26:43,875
Look there.

1020
01:26:47,250 --> 01:26:49,125
Hey, where are you going?

1021
01:27:02,125 --> 01:27:04,250
Chief, can't say about
the power in this milk,

1022
01:27:04,250 --> 01:27:06,000
but it surely has water.

1023
01:27:06,250 --> 01:27:07,500
As long as his blood is concern,

1024
01:27:07,625 --> 01:27:08,750
forget about the super power,

1025
01:27:08,875 --> 01:27:10,000
there's no sign of even the immunity.

1026
01:27:10,375 --> 01:27:11,625
One thing is very clear, boss.

1027
01:27:11,750 --> 01:27:15,000
Hanumant is getting this power
from some other source.

1028
01:28:04,750 --> 01:28:08,750
Sir, this isn't any rock but the mountain.

1029
01:28:08,875 --> 01:28:09,875
With a slight movement of the structure,

1030
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:11,250
machine has crossed the danger mark.

1031
01:28:11,375 --> 01:28:13,250
Nobody can displace this.

1032
01:28:17,125 --> 01:28:19,875
He himself will tell
us about his source of power.

1033
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:21,500
Wait and watch.

1034
01:29:12,875 --> 01:29:14,000
Run!

1035
01:29:14,125 --> 01:29:16,500
-Run!
-The rope is broken, run.

1036
01:29:22,500 --> 01:29:23,500
Run!

1037
01:29:23,875 --> 01:29:25,500
Move... . move... .

1038
01:29:27,500 --> 01:29:28,875
Save that girl.

1039
01:29:30,625 --> 01:29:32,000
Come on, move.

1040
01:29:33,875 --> 01:29:35,000
-Hey...
-Stop, Meena.

1041
01:29:38,250 --> 01:29:39,750
Hurry up. Run!

1042
01:30:04,375 --> 01:30:06,375
"Lord Ram!"

1043
01:30:11,500 --> 01:30:13,375
Hurry up. Run!

1044
01:30:54,750 --> 01:30:56,750
Hanumant!

1045
01:30:57,875 --> 01:30:59,250
Hanumant!

1046
01:30:59,375 --> 01:31:00,000
Hanumant!

1047
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:00,250
Hanumant!

1048
01:31:00,500 --> 01:31:02,250
Hanumant!

1049
01:31:02,375 --> 01:31:03,500
Hanumant!

1050
01:31:03,625 --> 01:31:04,625
Hanumant!

1051
01:31:04,875 --> 01:31:06,125
Hanumant!

1052
01:31:12,625 --> 01:31:15,125
-My daughter!
-Grandma!

1053
01:31:18,125 --> 01:31:19,375
Hanumant!

1054
01:31:19,500 --> 01:31:20,625
Hanumant!

1055
01:31:26,250 --> 01:31:27,375
Hanumant!

1056
01:31:27,500 --> 01:31:28,500
Hanumant!

1057
01:31:28,625 --> 01:31:29,375
Hanumant!

1058
01:31:29,500 --> 01:31:30,375
Hanumant!

1059
01:31:30,500 --> 01:31:33,500
Hanumant!

1060
01:31:33,875 --> 01:31:34,875
Hanumant!

1061
01:31:35,250 --> 01:31:36,125
Hanumant!

1062
01:31:36,250 --> 01:31:37,250
Hanumant!

1063
01:31:37,375 --> 01:31:38,375
Hanumant!

1064
01:31:38,500 --> 01:31:39,375
Hanumant!

1065
01:31:39,500 --> 01:31:40,375
Hanumant!

1066
01:31:40,875 --> 01:31:43,500
Your action has been
noted by everybody today.

1067
01:31:43,625 --> 01:31:45,625
What's the matter?
Do you like him?

1068
01:31:47,250 --> 01:31:48,250
Hanumant!

1069
01:31:48,500 --> 01:31:49,250
Hanumant!

1070
01:31:49,500 --> 01:31:51,625
Hanumant!

1071
01:31:51,750 --> 01:31:52,500
Hanumant!

1072
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:56,000
Hanumant!

1073
01:31:56,125 --> 01:31:57,125
Hanumant!

1074
01:31:57,500 --> 01:31:58,875
Hanumant!

1075
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:00,000
Hanumant!

1076
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:00,125
Hanumant!

1077
01:32:00,500 --> 01:32:03,875
Hanumant!

1078
01:32:04,125 --> 01:32:05,625
Hanumant!

1079
01:32:05,750 --> 01:32:06,750
Hanumant!

1080
01:32:13,125 --> 01:32:14,875
Chief, I had told you that I will design

1081
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:16,125
the most powerful suit ever.

1082
01:32:16,250 --> 01:32:17,250
It's ready.

1083
01:32:18,500 --> 01:32:19,750
Shazam!

1084
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
The megaman 2.0

1085
01:32:29,625 --> 01:32:30,750
And guess what!

1086
01:32:31,125 --> 01:32:33,750
I've used the stronger
material than vibranium.

1087
01:32:33,875 --> 01:32:35,625
It's destruction is impossible.

1088
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:37,000
Kickass, right?

1089
01:32:38,625 --> 01:32:40,625
And look at this, Chief.

1090
01:32:42,625 --> 01:32:44,875
You might wonder what's so special
about this hand glove?

1091
01:32:44,875 --> 01:32:46,000
It's not any ordinary glove.

1092
01:32:46,125 --> 01:32:50,000
Just one punch of this hand
will fail Hanumant's power.

1093
01:32:50,250 --> 01:32:51,625
Come on, try it, Chief.
Try it.

1094
01:32:51,875 --> 01:32:52,875
Try it.

1095
01:32:54,625 --> 01:32:56,125
Feel it, Chief. Feel the power.

1096
01:32:56,750 --> 01:32:57,875
Come on. Come on, yes.

1097
01:33:06,500 --> 01:33:08,375
Hanumant!

1098
01:33:08,500 --> 01:33:09,625
Hanumant!

1099
01:33:09,750 --> 01:33:10,750
Hanumant!

1100
01:33:18,125 --> 01:33:20,125
See this, after today's incidence,

1101
01:33:20,250 --> 01:33:22,000
you've become famous in
all the neighbouring villages.

1102
01:33:22,250 --> 01:33:23,500
This is just the beginning.

1103
01:33:23,875 --> 01:33:24,875
Okay, listen.

1104
01:33:25,125 --> 01:33:27,500
How long do we live this boring life?

1105
01:33:27,875 --> 01:33:29,125
I'm thinking of playing Olympics.

1106
01:33:29,500 --> 01:33:32,000
And win few kilos of gold for India.

1107
01:33:32,125 --> 01:33:33,500
Will you play Olympics?

1108
01:33:33,625 --> 01:33:35,750
This gem will help me win.

1109
01:33:36,375 --> 01:33:37,625
Yes, that's true.

1110
01:33:37,750 --> 01:33:39,500
If I throw something,

1111
01:33:39,500 --> 01:33:41,125
won't it go as far as 2 kilometers,
what say?

1112
01:33:41,250 --> 01:33:42,125
-Of course.
-Isn't it?

1113
01:33:42,250 --> 01:33:43,500
-It has to.
-Yes.

1114
01:33:44,125 --> 01:33:45,250
Tell me one thing.

1115
01:33:45,375 --> 01:33:47,375
What if the competition is held at night?

1116
01:33:49,125 --> 01:33:50,000
Forget about the medal.

1117
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:51,375
I've already won Meenakshi's heart.
That's all.

1118
01:33:51,500 --> 01:33:52,500
Now, I just have to win
her grandpa's confidence.

1119
01:33:52,625 --> 01:33:53,500
Then the line will be clear.

1120
01:33:53,625 --> 01:33:56,250
Why are you in a hurry for that?

1121
01:33:57,500 --> 01:33:58,875
I want to marry Meenakshi.

1122
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:00,000
-Oh, so you want to get married, huh?
-Yes.

1123
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:00,125
-Oh, so you want to get married, huh?
-Yes.

1124
01:34:00,125 --> 01:34:01,250
Have some shame.

1125
01:34:01,375 --> 01:34:03,250
Think about your elder sister.
She's still single.

1126
01:34:03,250 --> 01:34:05,125
No ways, I won't wait for her.

1127
01:34:05,250 --> 01:34:07,000
Everybody knows how arrogant she is.

1128
01:34:07,125 --> 01:34:08,875
Nobody will marry her.

1129
01:34:09,250 --> 01:34:11,375
That's why I can't wait for her.

1130
01:34:11,500 --> 01:34:13,500
Go ahead, dear.

1131
01:34:13,625 --> 01:34:15,500
From years,
your elder sister has remained single.

1132
01:34:15,625 --> 01:34:18,000
You can't even earn
for your own livelihood.

1133
01:34:18,125 --> 01:34:20,125
Stop it, aunt.

1134
01:34:20,250 --> 01:34:22,000
It's not my fault if
nobody is ready to marry her.

1135
01:34:22,125 --> 01:34:24,625
Do you know the reason
behind her rejections?

1136
01:34:24,625 --> 01:34:25,875
You!

1137
01:34:26,625 --> 01:34:28,000
Who will marry her?

1138
01:34:28,125 --> 01:34:31,125
After marriage,
she wants to take you along with her.

1139
01:34:35,500 --> 01:34:39,625
Poor girl is worried about your future.

1140
01:34:39,750 --> 01:34:41,750
That's why she puts a
condition to all the prospects

1141
01:34:41,750 --> 01:34:45,000
that he will have to accept you,
if he wants to marry her.

1142
01:34:45,250 --> 01:34:47,500
People mock her for this.

1143
01:34:47,625 --> 01:34:50,250
Who will accept her
brother along with her?

1144
01:34:50,375 --> 01:34:52,500
That's why she rejects all the proposals.

1145
01:34:52,625 --> 01:34:54,500
But she never told you this.

1146
01:34:54,625 --> 01:34:56,500
And you call her arrogant?

1147
01:34:57,625 --> 01:34:59,125
What's going on, Hanumant?

1148
01:35:03,500 --> 01:35:06,875
Hey, hero!
What brings you home early today?

1149
01:35:13,625 --> 01:35:14,625
What's wrong with him?

1150
01:35:24,625 --> 01:35:25,750
People call you... .

1151
01:35:26,250 --> 01:35:27,375
What do they say?

1152
01:35:27,500 --> 01:35:30,125
Yes, Superhero. Right?

1153
01:35:30,250 --> 01:35:32,875
People is comparing
you with mighty Hanuman.

1154
01:35:34,625 --> 01:35:36,500
Mighty Hanuman is the most powerful God.

1155
01:35:37,375 --> 01:35:39,625
He became Lord Rama's strength

1156
01:35:39,625 --> 01:35:41,125
and served Ayodhya.

1157
01:35:42,625 --> 01:35:45,375
You too will have to become

1158
01:35:45,375 --> 01:35:46,875
Anjanadri's strength and protect it.

1159
01:35:53,750 --> 01:35:54,625
What happened?

1160
01:35:54,625 --> 01:35:57,625
Aren't you finding any
faults in my cooking today?

1161
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,500
Where's my spade?

1162
01:36:13,125 --> 01:36:14,875
Last night I had kept it here.

1163
01:36:23,875 --> 01:36:26,125
These are 500 coconuts. Count if you want.

1164
01:36:26,500 --> 01:36:29,000
No need. Here you go.

1165
01:36:29,125 --> 01:36:31,625
Rs. 2000 full.

1166
01:36:31,875 --> 01:36:33,000
See you, sister.

1167
01:36:35,500 --> 01:36:37,625
Hey, Siddheshwar wanted 200 coconuts

1168
01:36:37,750 --> 01:36:39,500
for Lord Rama's coronation ceremony.

1169
01:36:39,625 --> 01:36:40,625
I've plucked them.

1170
01:36:42,250 --> 01:36:43,250
Listen to me.

1171
01:36:43,375 --> 01:36:45,625
I've tied the ropes.
Giri will come to pick it up.

1172
01:36:46,625 --> 01:36:47,500
Hanumant.

1173
01:36:47,750 --> 01:36:50,500
Kashi said coconut coir
is very much in demand.

1174
01:36:50,875 --> 01:36:52,500
He will find us a buyer.

1175
01:36:52,625 --> 01:36:55,750
If it is sold,
we will make few more money.

1176
01:36:55,875 --> 01:36:57,125
That reminds me.

1177
01:36:57,250 --> 01:36:58,875
His business has flourished
after I promoted it.

1178
01:36:59,375 --> 01:37:00,000
He has made a good profit.

1179
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:00,375
He has made a good profit.

1180
01:37:00,500 --> 01:37:01,750
He is going to open a dairy now.

1181
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,625
He will get mad if he
really manages to open it.

1182
01:37:06,125 --> 01:37:08,250
I'm famished,
please serve my plate, sister.

1183
01:37:08,625 --> 01:37:09,625
Right away.

1184
01:37:13,750 --> 01:37:15,500
What happened? The meal is ready.

1185
01:37:20,625 --> 01:37:21,875
I'm famished.

1186
01:37:24,500 --> 01:37:25,500
Am I a better cook than you?

1187
01:37:31,625 --> 01:37:32,375
What are you waiting for?

1188
01:37:32,500 --> 01:37:33,250
Go and check.

1189
01:37:33,375 --> 01:37:34,625
Am I supposed to do everything?

1190
01:37:45,375 --> 01:37:46,125
What's it?

1191
01:37:46,125 --> 01:37:47,250
Several times I've told you.

1192
01:37:47,500 --> 01:37:48,875
Sister won't marry you.

1193
01:37:48,875 --> 01:37:50,750
He wants to take me along
with him after your marriage.

1194
01:37:51,500 --> 01:37:53,625
How can I go and live with him?

1195
01:37:53,875 --> 01:37:56,625
Now, the entire village
is my responsibility.

1196
01:37:57,125 --> 01:37:59,875
If you think I will leave this village
to live with you in the city,

1197
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:01,125
then you've mistaken it.

1198
01:38:01,625 --> 01:38:03,000
I've to do a lot for the villagers.

1199
01:38:06,875 --> 01:38:07,875
What happened?

1200
01:38:24,125 --> 01:38:25,375
Attention, everybody.

1201
01:38:25,375 --> 01:38:28,000
There's an important announcement.

1202
01:38:28,125 --> 01:38:32,750
Nominations forms will be filled
for village election tomorrow.

1203
01:38:37,500 --> 01:38:39,750
This time she won't survive.

1204
01:38:47,375 --> 01:38:49,375
For the first time in
the history of Anjanadri,

1205
01:38:49,500 --> 01:38:51,750
elections will be held democratically.

1206
01:38:52,125 --> 01:38:53,625
And who has brought this change?

1207
01:38:53,875 --> 01:38:55,000
Our Hanumant.

1208
01:38:56,250 --> 01:38:57,125
My friend.

1209
01:38:57,250 --> 01:39:00,000
We always mistook him as lazy, foppish,

1210
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:00,875
We always mistook him as lazy, foppish,

1211
01:39:01,625 --> 01:39:03,625
pickpocket and double standard.

1212
01:39:04,375 --> 01:39:06,625
Expecting something from
such a useless fellow...

1213
01:39:06,750 --> 01:39:08,125
Stop praising me.

1214
01:39:08,500 --> 01:39:10,250
Teacher is there. Project him.

1215
01:39:11,375 --> 01:39:12,750
So far he has educated our children.

1216
01:39:12,875 --> 01:39:14,125
Now, let him manage the village.

1217
01:39:14,750 --> 01:39:16,625
See, he has agreed.

1218
01:39:16,750 --> 01:39:17,875
Applause for him.

1219
01:39:18,750 --> 01:39:19,875
I am safe.

1220
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:21,375
Is anyone else interested
in filing nomination?

1221
01:39:21,500 --> 01:39:23,875
No need. He's the right candidate.

1222
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:25,375
I want to file nomination.

1223
01:39:34,625 --> 01:39:35,750
Yeah.

1224
01:39:41,375 --> 01:39:42,750
Crazy.

1225
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:48,875
Oh, hello,
this is election, not any grocery shop.

1226
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:50,000
Quiet!

1227
01:39:50,625 --> 01:39:51,875
My dear villagers.

1228
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,500
If you elect me, I will make sure

1229
01:39:54,625 --> 01:39:56,875
you won't have to worry
about your two meal.

1230
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:58,375
I will sell ration at cheaper rate.

1231
01:39:58,375 --> 01:40:00,000
5 days holiday tour
to Thailand will be free.

1232
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:01,250
5 days holiday tour
to Thailand will be free.

1233
01:40:01,875 --> 01:40:03,250
Long live. Gunesh Rao.

1234
01:40:03,375 --> 01:40:04,625
Long live. Gunesh Rao.

1235
01:40:09,625 --> 01:40:13,000
If a school teacher wins this election,
he will talk big.

1236
01:40:13,125 --> 01:40:14,500
And give tedious tasks to complete.

1237
01:40:14,625 --> 01:40:16,500
But if you make me win,

1238
01:40:16,625 --> 01:40:21,625
your children will be happy
with my work and love me.

1239
01:40:25,875 --> 01:40:27,375
So, don't forget, friends.

1240
01:40:27,375 --> 01:40:30,250
My name is Guneshwar Rao.
And my symbol is...

1241
01:40:31,625 --> 01:40:32,875
Baby elephant.

1242
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:34,125
Beat the drums.

1243
01:41:31,625 --> 01:41:33,000
The effect of his medicines has worn off.

1244
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:34,875
Unmask him.

1245
01:41:36,041 --> 01:41:37,291
He will see us, boss.

1246
01:41:37,791 --> 01:41:39,166
Shall we wear it then?

1247
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
We don't have that many masks, boss.

1248
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:44,000
Shazam!

1249
01:41:44,250 --> 01:41:45,541
It seems he's getting back to senses.

1250
01:41:45,625 --> 01:41:47,125
Let's remove his mask, boss.

1251
01:41:50,750 --> 01:41:54,875
Chief, I will make him spill beans now.

1252
01:41:55,375 --> 01:41:56,625
You just watch.

1253
01:42:00,250 --> 01:42:02,125
What happened? Are you shocked?

1254
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:05,875
What's all this?

1255
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:07,000
Why did you bring me here?

1256
01:42:07,125 --> 01:42:08,250
And why have you tied me up?

1257
01:42:08,375 --> 01:42:10,625
I want to know the source of your power.

1258
01:42:12,875 --> 01:42:14,625
-Gem?!
-Usually people prefer violence,

1259
01:42:14,625 --> 01:42:16,125
but I will use chemical.

1260
01:42:16,125 --> 01:42:17,375
Come to the point, Siri.

1261
01:42:17,500 --> 01:42:19,750
Yes, chief. Give me two minutes.

1262
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:21,625
Tell me the secret of your power.

1263
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,875
I've already told you.
It's in Kashi's buffalo's milk.

1264
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:26,375
And everybody is aware of it.

1265
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:28,000
Oh really?

1266
01:42:29,250 --> 01:42:30,875
Do you think you can fool me?

1267
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:32,750
Next, you will say that you get power

1268
01:42:32,750 --> 01:42:34,125
from this red stone.

1269
01:42:34,125 --> 01:42:37,750
As per my information,
there's some Mr. Gem.

1270
01:42:39,125 --> 01:42:41,875
I know it's the real source of your power.

1271
01:42:42,500 --> 01:42:45,125
-Siri!
-Who's this Mr. Gem?

1272
01:42:47,125 --> 01:42:50,000
Who's he? I don't know any Mr. Gem.

1273
01:42:50,250 --> 01:42:51,750
You want money, don't you?

1274
01:42:51,750 --> 01:42:54,875
Tell me how much do you need?
I will pay you.

1275
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:56,750
-Siri!
-Let me handle it.

1276
01:42:56,875 --> 01:42:57,875
Come on.

1277
01:42:58,250 --> 01:43:00,000
Let me go. Meenakshi is in danger.

1278
01:43:00,250 --> 01:43:01,625
You must tell me.

1279
01:43:01,750 --> 01:43:03,500
-Siri.
-Shut up.

1280
01:43:03,750 --> 01:43:05,125
I told you, let me handle this.

1281
01:43:05,125 --> 01:43:06,750
Stop shouting.

1282
01:43:07,750 --> 01:43:09,125
This table...

1283
01:43:09,250 --> 01:43:11,000
Damn!

1284
01:43:12,375 --> 01:43:13,500
Shazam!

1285
01:43:23,250 --> 01:43:24,500
Don't move from here, okay?

1286
01:43:30,500 --> 01:43:31,625
Now, tell me.

1287
01:43:32,500 --> 01:43:34,000
What will you do? Will you kill me?

1288
01:43:34,125 --> 01:43:36,125
Why not? Can't I kill you?

1289
01:43:36,250 --> 01:43:37,000
Touch me if you've guts.

1290
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:38,000
Don't challenge me.

1291
01:43:38,125 --> 01:43:39,125
Can you really dare?

1292
01:43:45,375 --> 01:43:46,750
"Lord Ram"!

1293
01:44:33,625 --> 01:44:40,875
"Child Hanuman is born to Mother Anjana."

1294
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:47,625
"One morning he saw
a red fruit on the sky."

1295
01:44:47,750 --> 01:44:50,875
"Moment he swallowed it,"

1296
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:54,500
"he expressed mixed emotions,
sour and spicy like the pickle."

1297
01:44:54,625 --> 01:44:57,625
"He came to his mom
and curiously asked her,

1298
01:44:57,750 --> 01:45:00,000
"what this pickle actually is."

1299
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:01,375
"what this pickle actually is."

1300
01:45:01,500 --> 01:45:08,000
"Show me the recipe of this
bright-red pickle made of mangoes."

1301
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:14,750
"Knowing his curiosity,
Anjana bought home few mangoes."

1302
01:45:14,750 --> 01:45:16,625
Can I taste the pickle?

1303
01:45:16,750 --> 01:45:18,500
Not, so soon, dear.

1304
01:45:18,625 --> 01:45:21,125
First find few men and
tell them to pluck mangoes.

1305
01:45:21,250 --> 01:45:23,125
Cut those mangoes into cubicle shape.

1306
01:45:23,250 --> 01:45:24,625
Marinate them in the mixture

1307
01:45:24,750 --> 01:45:28,875
of red chilli powder,
salt and mustard oil.

1308
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:32,000
This process will complete by the evening.

1309
01:45:33,625 --> 01:45:35,375
Alright, I will help you.

1310
01:45:35,500 --> 01:45:37,375
No need, dear.

1311
01:46:52,375 --> 01:46:57,000
"For the first step of making the pickle,"

1312

"Anjneya took a leap and reached
the tallest branches of the tree."

1313

"Anjneya took a leap and reached
the tallest branches of the tree."

1314
01:47:06,500 --> 01:47:11,125
"His glowing face is
adding to his personalities."

1315
01:47:11,250 --> 01:47:15,875
"Without any weapon, he managed
to cut all the mangoes into half."

1316
01:47:25,250 --> 01:47:29,875
"He's the son of Wind-god,
in no time he brought them down."

1317
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:35,250
"After all, he's Maruti. He
swiftly removed all the unwanted seeds."

1318
01:47:46,375 --> 01:47:51,125
"Ocean wasn't ready to give salt,
so he stopped it's tides."

1319
01:47:51,125 --> 01:47:55,875
"And produced the salt on the seashore."

1320
01:47:58,250 --> 01:48:00,000
"To coat the mango cubes
with red chilli powder,"

1321
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,875
"To coat the mango cubes
with red chilli powder,"

1322
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:07,875
"he changed the wind pattern to avoid
it from entering in the girl's eyes."

1323
01:48:28,750 --> 01:48:33,375
"Then sprinkled some roughly
powdered mustard seeds."

1324
01:48:38,250 --> 01:48:41,875
"If anybody tries to do the mischief."

1325
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,250
"If anybody tries to do the mischief."

1326
01:48:45,375 --> 01:48:48,750
"He quickly drives them away."

1327
01:48:59,375 --> 01:49:00,000
"There were many crows cawing around,"

1328
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:01,750
"There were many crows cawing around,"

1329
01:49:01,750 --> 01:49:04,125
"when the spices were getting mixed,"

1330
01:49:04,250 --> 01:49:09,125
"Moment they come forward, he'd
rotate his stick and they would fly away."

1331
01:49:13,625 --> 01:49:18,250
"There was one bird
eyeing at the mangoes."

1332
01:49:18,250 --> 01:49:20,625
"Mother quickly added some garlic cloves"

1333
01:49:20,625 --> 01:49:23,625
"and poured the pot full of oil on it."

1334
01:49:27,500 --> 01:49:30,000
"That's it, the pickle is ready."

1335
01:49:30,125 --> 01:49:32,750
"Cover and shake the pot and dance."

1336
01:49:37,125 --> 01:49:40,000
"Bajrangbali is very smart,"

1337
01:49:41,750 --> 01:49:44,125
"Bajrangbali is very smart,"

1338
01:49:44,125 --> 01:49:47,375
"He couldn't hold his taste buds."

1339
01:49:48,875 --> 01:49:52,375
"Anjani's son Hanumant."

1340
01:49:53,125 --> 01:49:56,500
"Your ways are miraculous."

1341
01:49:58,250 --> 01:50:00,000
"Anjani's son Hanumant."

1342
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:01,500
"Anjani's son Hanumant."

1343
01:50:02,500 --> 01:50:07,250
"Your might is fiery."

1344
01:50:58,875 --> 01:51:00,000
Have you killed the girl?

1345
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:00,625
Have you killed the girl?

1346
01:51:02,250 --> 01:51:03,125
What's in this?

1347
01:51:03,625 --> 01:51:04,875
Pickle.

1348
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,500
Made of your dacoits' bones.

1349
01:51:10,875 --> 01:51:12,875
Listen, enmity will not benefit any of us.

1350
01:51:13,125 --> 01:51:14,125
So, let's just drop that idea.

1351
01:51:16,750 --> 01:51:18,000
This is the nomination filed in your name

1352
01:51:18,125 --> 01:51:19,000
for the village council election.

1353
01:51:19,875 --> 01:51:22,250
Listen, you love power
and I love Meenakshi.

1354
01:51:22,500 --> 01:51:23,750
I'm giving your power back to you.

1355
01:51:23,875 --> 01:51:25,375
Now, you spare mine.

1356
01:51:25,750 --> 01:51:28,000
If you win this election,
villagers will think

1357
01:51:28,125 --> 01:51:30,250
that Gajapati has reformed.

1358
01:51:31,125 --> 01:51:33,000
But if you wouldn't,

1359
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,750
then they will think that
you too have become a dacoit.

1360
01:51:43,625 --> 01:51:44,875
You're fine now.

1361
01:51:45,125 --> 01:51:46,500
Your duty is over, physician.

1362
01:52:58,166 --> 01:53:00,000
we will have to find out today,
what is the matter with this Michael.

1363
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:00,875
we will have to find out today,
what is the matter with this Michael.

1364
01:53:21,625 --> 01:53:24,125
-Hey, Siri.
-Hello, how can I help you?

1365
01:53:24,250 --> 01:53:25,875
No, dear. He called me.

1366
01:53:26,750 --> 01:53:27,625
Yes, chief.

1367
01:53:27,750 --> 01:53:29,500
I found the source of Hanumant's power.

1368
01:53:29,625 --> 01:53:31,125
That's fantastic news, Chief.

1369
01:53:31,750 --> 01:53:34,625
Increase MHG42 concentration now.

1370
01:53:34,750 --> 01:53:36,000
I want one ton.

1371
01:53:36,125 --> 01:53:37,750
You don't need so much for him, chief.

1372
01:53:37,875 --> 01:53:39,500
One ton will destroy the entire village...

1373
01:53:44,750 --> 01:53:46,000
What are you planning, chief?

1374
01:53:46,375 --> 01:53:47,625
That's too dangerous.

1375
01:53:50,625 --> 01:53:53,500
Only the village will benefit,
if the power remains with him.

1376
01:53:53,500 --> 01:53:57,000
But if it is with us,
we will rule the world.

1377
01:53:57,750 --> 01:53:59,000
This isn't right, Chief.

1378
01:53:59,875 --> 01:54:00,000
You also kill the mice
in the name of experiments.

1379
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:03,625
You also kill the mice
in the name of experiments.

1380
01:54:04,250 --> 01:54:05,625
These are only the mice.

1381
01:54:07,500 --> 01:54:10,750
Animal lives are sacrificed
so as to protect the village.

1382
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:14,375
Can't we sacrifice a village
so as to protect the world?

1383
01:54:14,375 --> 01:54:15,375
What?!

1384
01:54:15,375 --> 01:54:18,875
We need bigger sacrifices
in public interest.

1385
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:21,500
Forget about becoming a superhero,

1386
01:54:21,625 --> 01:54:22,875
you're becoming a super villain.

1387
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:23,875
Have you lost it?

1388
01:54:30,750 --> 01:54:34,500
Even my parents tried to hinder my dreams.

1389
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:39,250
When my house caught fire,
I managed to escape.

1390
01:54:39,875 --> 01:54:43,625
Did you ever think why
they couldn't manage to escape?

1391
01:54:45,500 --> 01:54:47,625
Michael! Michael!

1392
01:54:47,750 --> 01:54:49,125
Open the door, Michael.

1393
01:54:49,250 --> 01:54:51,250
Michael, please. Open the door.

1394
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:59,750
There was no need to kill
the robbers of bank robbery.

1395
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,250
Have you thought why
I killed them mercilessly?

1396
01:55:04,375 --> 01:55:05,750
Superhero.

1397
01:55:05,750 --> 01:55:08,125
Will you become a superhero, kiddo?

1398
01:55:16,250 --> 01:55:17,750
I need to expose you.

1399
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:19,875
You're not a superhero.

1400
01:55:26,875 --> 01:55:30,625
I thought only you
can understand my dreams.

1401
01:55:32,875 --> 01:55:34,750
But you're a traitor.

1402

-Hello!

from a serious asthma attack?

1406
01:55:47,875 --> 01:55:49,625
Not more than a few minutes.

What about Hanumant?

1413

1462
02:02:58,625 --> 02:03:00,000
But my generations-old inherited... gem.

1463
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:03,125
But my generations-old inherited... gem.

1464
02:03:03,250 --> 02:03:04,250
That should be in the bag.

1465
02:03:07,250 --> 02:03:09,000
Lord Rama, now You're the saviour!

1466
02:03:10,875 --> 02:03:12,125
It's not here.

1467
02:03:16,125 --> 02:03:17,125
Keep sitting, dear.

1468
02:03:17,250 --> 02:03:18,875
You can't get up in
the middle of the ceremony.

1469
02:03:22,250 --> 02:03:23,875
-Please, return it.
-You...

1470
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:25,000
Stop, Hanumant.

1471
02:03:25,250 --> 02:03:27,250
You don't know him. He's an imposter.

1472
02:03:27,375 --> 02:03:28,500
Don't make me embarrass.

1473
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:30,375
Return his belongings.

1474
02:03:32,875 --> 02:03:36,125
Now you don't have any option, Hanumant.

1475
02:03:36,625 --> 02:03:37,500
Please return it.

1476
02:03:37,625 --> 02:03:38,750
But that gem belongs to Hanumant.

1477
02:03:38,875 --> 02:03:40,250
Exactly, it belongs to Hanumant.

1478
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:44,625
Give it to me.

1479
02:04:03,125 --> 02:04:04,375
This is it.

1480
02:04:05,375 --> 02:04:06,625
Yes.

1481
02:04:41,750 --> 02:04:44,625
Generations-old inherited... gem.

1482
02:04:44,625 --> 02:04:46,375
That should be in the bag. Right?

1483
02:04:46,375 --> 02:04:49,000
Can't you differentiate between
a gem and a piece of glass?

1484
02:04:50,375 --> 02:04:52,000
If it was really his property,
he would have identified it.

1485
02:04:52,125 --> 02:04:53,500
What a befitting reply.

1486
02:04:53,625 --> 02:04:54,750
In the name of welfare,

1487
02:04:54,750 --> 02:04:57,125
this butcher is making us scapegoat.

1488
02:04:58,125 --> 02:05:00,000
See, he's exposed now.

1489
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:00,625
See, he's exposed now.

1490
02:05:01,250 --> 02:05:03,375
We thought you're a gentleman.

1491
02:05:03,500 --> 02:05:04,625
But you're a con.

1492
02:05:04,750 --> 02:05:05,750
Why entertain him?

1493
02:05:05,875 --> 02:05:07,750
Throw him out otherwise,
he will start again.

1494
02:05:08,125 --> 02:05:09,500
Yes, this is it.

1495
02:05:09,625 --> 02:05:12,875
Yes, this is it. Yes.

1496
02:05:12,875 --> 02:05:14,000
He's a drama queen.

1497
02:05:14,125 --> 02:05:17,500
He's actually looking for this.

1498
02:05:31,375 --> 02:05:32,750
Finish him.

1499
02:05:34,750 --> 02:05:35,875
Hey, Hanumant!

1500
02:05:52,750 --> 02:05:54,000
Swear on Goddess Durga.

1501
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:55,750
Don't you dare touch my brother,

1502
02:05:55,750 --> 02:05:57,250
if you love your life.

1503
02:05:58,375 --> 02:06:00,000
This is Indian woman.

1504
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:00,625
This is Indian woman.

1505
02:06:11,750 --> 02:06:12,750
My God!

1506
02:06:49,625 --> 02:06:50,750
Hanumant!

1507
02:06:56,125 --> 02:06:57,125
Hanumant!

1508
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:12,875
Sister!

1509
02:07:13,125 --> 02:07:14,125
No, sister.

1510
02:07:14,125 --> 02:07:15,000
Sister!

1511
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:19,375
Hey, they are running away. Nab them.

1512
02:07:19,750 --> 02:07:21,375
-Let's go.
-Catch them.

1513
02:07:21,375 --> 02:07:22,375
Kashi!

1514
02:07:23,500 --> 02:07:24,625
Kashi!

1515
02:07:34,750 --> 02:07:36,125
I am sorry, brother.

1516
02:07:36,625 --> 02:07:38,250
I misunderstood you.

1517
02:07:39,500 --> 02:07:40,625
Take her to the hospital.

1518
02:07:45,500 --> 02:07:46,500
We don't have that much time.

1519
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:49,625
Gem will save you.

1520
02:08:28,750 --> 02:08:30,250
Keep your eyes open, sister.

1521
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:45,000
Sister?!

1522
02:08:46,875 --> 02:08:47,875
Sister?!

1523
02:08:49,375 --> 02:08:50,500
Sister, get up.

1524
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:51,875
Sister!

1525
02:08:52,500 --> 02:08:53,375
Open your eyes.

1526
02:08:53,625 --> 02:08:55,750
Sister. Sister.

1527
02:08:56,375 --> 02:08:58,500
Sister, open your eyes.

1528
02:08:59,125 --> 02:09:00,000
Open your eyes, sister.

1529
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:00,750
Open your eyes, sister.

1530
02:09:27,375 --> 02:09:29,625
"Lord Ram!"

1531
02:10:27,250 --> 02:10:30,000
"It seem like a nightmare."

1532
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,750
"in which I've lost my dear one."

1533
02:10:32,875 --> 02:10:38,375
"Moment I'll wake up,
I will find you beside me."

1534
02:10:38,625 --> 02:10:43,250
"My sister. A mother-figure for me."

1535
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:49,375
"who was always available on my call."

1536
02:10:49,750 --> 02:10:55,250
"Today you've sacrificed your life"

1537
02:10:55,375 --> 02:11:00,000
"to save mine."

1538
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:00,625
"to save mine."

1539
02:11:01,125 --> 02:11:11,000
"I never wanted to see you off like this,
my sister."

1540
02:11:40,625 --> 02:11:45,625
"I could never the moments
when spent together."

1541
02:11:46,375 --> 02:11:51,750
"At any cost,
I will never get back those moments now."

1542
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:57,375
"Open your eyes, sister. Look at me once."

1543
02:11:57,625 --> 02:12:00,000
"Why are you angry with me?
Just talk to me."

1544
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,875
"Why are you angry with me?
Just talk to me."

1545
02:12:03,125 --> 02:12:08,750
"You've nursed me all my life."

1546
02:12:08,875 --> 02:12:14,375
"But I wasn't with you,
when I should have been."

1547
02:12:14,625 --> 02:12:24,500
"I never wanted to see you off like this,
my sister."

1548
02:12:25,125 --> 02:12:27,500
Listen, the eclipse I about to begin.

1549
02:12:27,625 --> 02:12:28,750
Let's go inside.

1550
02:12:49,625 --> 02:12:51,875
Boss, that gem has fallen
somewhere in the village.

1551
02:13:07,750 --> 02:13:09,875
If I won't get this power,

1552
02:13:09,875 --> 02:13:12,500
I will wreak havoc in the entire universe.

1553
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:13,125
Mom!

1554
02:14:48,875 --> 02:14:49,875
No.

1555
02:14:54,750 --> 02:14:56,125
Go there. You, too.

1556
02:14:56,250 --> 02:14:57,500
Check near the temple.

1557
02:14:57,625 --> 02:14:59,500
Search every nook and cranny.

1558
02:15:05,750 --> 02:15:06,500
Hanumant.

1559
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:08,625
village is engulfed with the smoke.

1560
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:10,625
Michael is searching the gem.

1561
02:15:11,250 --> 02:15:13,375
Everybody has turned into statue.

1562
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:15,375
Something untoward is going to happen.

1563
02:15:15,750 --> 02:15:17,250
Save everybody, Hanumant.

1564
02:15:17,625 --> 02:15:19,500
I couldn't save my sister.

1565
02:15:20,500 --> 02:15:21,875
How will I save the villagers?

1566
02:15:22,125 --> 02:15:23,375
Yes, but if Michael gets hands on the gem.

1567
02:15:23,500 --> 02:15:24,625
Let him get it.

1568
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:26,750
All this has happened because of that gem.

1569
02:15:27,375 --> 02:15:28,875
Had there been no gem, sister...

1570
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:33,500
No war is complete

1571
02:15:33,625 --> 02:15:37,375
without bloodshed and
sacrifice of loved ones' lives.

1572
02:15:47,750 --> 02:15:50,000
Dharma prevailed only because

1573
02:15:50,125 --> 02:15:51,625
Shri Rama received life-saving drug.

1574
02:15:52,875 --> 02:15:56,125
Imagine the consequences
if Ravana had received it.

1575
02:15:57,750 --> 02:15:59,875
The gem which you rejected was actually

1576
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:03,375
the 'Rudhiramani' created
from the blood of Shri Hanuman.

1577
02:16:10,750 --> 02:16:13,500
You were bestowed with
mighty Hanuman's power,

1578
02:16:13,625 --> 02:16:15,875
who can swallow even the solar system.

1579
02:16:22,125 --> 02:16:23,875
But why me? Why did I find that gem?

1580
02:16:25,750 --> 02:16:29,000
Why only Hanuman found Sita's jewelries?

1581
02:16:31,375 --> 02:16:33,125
To develop a path,
one needs to be the seeker

1582
02:16:33,250 --> 02:16:35,375
and follow that path.

1583
02:16:35,625 --> 02:16:39,000
You're the sound of upcoming great war.

1584
02:16:44,125 --> 02:16:45,875
Your hesitance is genuine.

1585
02:16:46,250 --> 02:16:49,250
After Ravan's death
his younger brother was crowned.

1586
02:16:49,750 --> 02:16:53,375
He was hesitant about taking
the reins of the kingdom.

1587
02:16:53,625 --> 02:16:55,625
That's when his friend came to him.

1588
02:16:56,375 --> 02:16:59,250
Made him aware of his duty
and awakened his confidence,

1589
02:16:59,375 --> 02:17:00,000
thus boosted his morale.

1590
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:00,625
thus boosted his morale.

1591
02:17:00,625 --> 02:17:03,000
That friend was Anajani's son

1592
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:06,000
and Rama's devotee, Shri Hanuman.

1593
02:17:13,625 --> 02:17:18,250
That king is still ruling
the kingdom of Lanka.

1594
02:17:18,375 --> 02:17:19,750
That's me, Vibhishan.

1595
02:17:28,625 --> 02:17:31,125
You can see only one person's misdeed.

1596
02:17:31,125 --> 02:17:33,250
But the mayhem is already on its way.

1597
02:17:33,875 --> 02:17:37,000
A great battle between
humans and demons is foretold.

1598
02:17:38,375 --> 02:17:41,125
Demons shiver with
the fear of 'Rudhirmani'.

1599
02:17:41,125 --> 02:17:45,125
Only you can avoid
this gem falling in the wrong hands

1600
02:17:46,250 --> 02:17:48,125
and avert the mayhem.

1601
02:17:50,375 --> 02:17:52,875
What will I alone do?

1602
02:17:53,875 --> 02:17:55,250
You call yourself alone?

1603
02:17:56,500 --> 02:18:00,000
Hanuman crossed the entire
ocean in just one jump.

1604
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:00,750
Hanuman crossed the entire
ocean in just one jump.

[Sanskrit chants]

1606
02:18:05,875 --> 02:18:07,875
He had destroyed the entire demon army.

1607
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,500
And shook Ravana's reign.

1608

[Sanskrit chants]

1609

With just one spark, he had
set ablaze the entire kingdom of Lanka.

Served Shri Rama like
his shadow in Tretayug.

[Sanskrit chants]

1613
02:18:34,250 --> 02:18:38,375
In Dwaparyug, he roared on the
flag of Krishna and Arjuna's chariot.

[Sanskrit chants]

1615
02:18:43,125 --> 02:18:45,000
In Kaliyug, he's always there with every

1616
02:18:45,125 --> 02:18:46,500
being that is fighting for justice.

1617
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:49,416
He was with you, too.

02:18:50,875 --> 02:18:53,000
[Sanskrit chants]

1619
02:19:07,375 --> 02:19:10,250
At enemy's selfishness and your nobility,

1620
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:12,375
selfishness will lose.

1621
02:19:12,875 --> 02:19:14,250
And your nobility will win.

1622
02:19:21,625 --> 02:19:24,000
Where there's Dharma, there's Hanuman.
