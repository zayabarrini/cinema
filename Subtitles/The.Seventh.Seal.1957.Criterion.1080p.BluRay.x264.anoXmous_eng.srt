2
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
"And when the Lamb had opened
the seventh seal..."

3
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:12,900
"there was silence in heaven
about the space of half an hour."

4
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:20,900
"And the seven angels
which had the seven trumpets..."

5
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,900
"prepared themselves to sound."

6
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,800
Who are you?

7
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,800
I am Death.

8
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,800
You have come for me?

9
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,900
I have been at your side
for a long time.

10
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,900
I know.

11
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,900
Are you prepared?

12
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,900
My flesh is afraid, but I am not.

13
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,800
Wait a moment.

14
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,800
You all say that.
But I give no respite.

15
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,800
You play chess, do you not?

16
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,800
How do you know that?

17
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,800
I have seen it in paintings.

18
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:01,800
Yes, I am quite a skilful player.

19
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,900
But no more so than I.

20
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,900
Why do you wish to play chess with me?

21
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,900
- That's my concern.
- You're quite right.

22
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:14,900
As long as I resist you, I live.

23
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,800
If I win, you set me free.

24
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,800
Black for you!

25
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,800
It becomes me well.

26
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,800
Between a strumpet's legs I lie.

27
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,800
That's the place for such as I.

28
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:04,800
The Lord is up aloft, you know.

29
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,800
But Satan finds us here below.

30
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,800
There's talk of omens
and other horrors.

31
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,800
Two horses had devoured each other...

32
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,800
graves gaped wide
and bones lay about.

33
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,800
Four suns were in the sky.

34
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,800
Where is the inn?

35
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,800
Did he show you the way?

36
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,800
Not exactly.

37
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,800
- What did he say?
- Nothing.

38
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,800
- Was he mute?
- No, milord.

39
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,800
He was most eloquent.

40
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,700
Indeed.

41
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,700
But very gloomy.

42
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:09,700
Have you had breakfast?

43
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,700
Pity I can't eat grass.

44
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,700
You must teach me.

45
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:18,700
We're feeling the pinch.

46
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:22,700
People here are not interested in art.

47
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,700
Mary! I have seen something!

48
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,700
What has happened?

49
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:28,700
A vision. It was quite real.

50
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,700
You and your visions!

51
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,700
I saw her anyway.

52
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,700
Who?

53
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,700
The Virgin Mary.

54
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,700
Did you really see her?

55
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,700
I could have touched her.

56
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:54,700
With her crown of gold
and her blue robe.

57
00:11:54,700 --> 00:12:00,700
She was holding the Child
and teaching Him to walk.

58
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:04,700
When she saw me, she smiled.

59
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,700
I had tears in my eyes.

60
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,700
And when I wiped them away,
she was gone.

61
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,600
And there was a great silence...

62
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,700
in heaven and on earth.

63
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,700
The things you make up!

64
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:28,700
You don't believe me, but it was true.

65
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:31,700
It's not the reality you see,
but another kind.

66
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:36,700
Like the Devil
painting the wheels red...

67
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,700
and using his tail as a brush.

68
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,700
Why did you remind me?

69
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,600
And you had red paint under your nails.

70
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,600
Well, I did make that up...

71
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,600
so that you would believe
my other visions.

72
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:55,700
Mind you're not taken for a fool.

73
00:12:55,700 --> 00:13:00,700
Because you're not. At least not yet.

74
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:04,700
It's not my fault if I hear voices...

75
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:09,700
and see the Virgin, and if angels
and devils like my company.

76
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:15,700
I have told you once and for all...

77
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,600
I must have sleep in the mornings!

78
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,600
I have asked you, but nothing helps.
Now will you shut up!

79
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,600
I want a better life for Michael.

80
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,600
He is going to be a great acrobat.

81
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,600
Or a juggler who does
the one impossible trick.

82
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,600
What trick is that?

83
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,600
Make a ball stand still in the air.

84
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:08,700
- But that's impossible.
- Yes, for us, but not for him.

85
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,700
Always daydreaming!

86
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:19,700
I've written a song.

87
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,600
Do you want to hear it?

88
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,600
Yes. I'm very curious.

89
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,600
A dove on a branch.

90
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,600
At Midsummer time.

91
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:36,600
She sang so sweetly of Jesus Christ.

92
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:41,600
In heaven is great rejoicing.

93
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,700
Are you asleep?

94
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:50,700
- It was a lovely song.
- It's not finished.

95
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:55,600
I heard, but I'll sleep a bit more.
Sing me the rest later.

96
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,600
You just sleep and sleep.

97
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:04,600
Is this a mask for an actor?

98
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,600
The priests pay well, so I play.

99
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,600
Going to play Death?

100
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,600
Scaring decent folk out of their wits.

101
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,700
When are we to perform?

102
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,700
At the Saints' Festival in Elsinore.

103
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:21,700
We will perform on the church steps.

104
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:26,600
Why not something bawdy?
People like it better.

105
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:30,600
They say the plague stalks the land.

106
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:35,600
The priests speculate in sudden death
and moral bellyache.

107
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,600
What parts are we playing?

108
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,600
A fool like you can play the Human Soul.

109
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,600
Not a good part.

110
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,600
Who decides? I'm the director
of the troupe.

111
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,600
"Your life, O fool..."

112
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,700
"hangs by a thread."

113
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,600
"Short is your day."

114
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,600
Will the women love me in this get-up?

115
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,600
Well, what is it?

116
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,600
Don't move. Don't speak.

117
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,600
I'm as silent as the grave.

118
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,600
I love you.

119
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,600
What is this supposed to be?

120
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,500
The Dance of Death.

121
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:01,500
- And this is Death.
- Yes, he dances with them.

122
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,600
Why all this daubing?

123
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,600
To remind people of death.

124
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,600
That won't make them any happier.

125
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:14,600
Why make them happy?
Why not scare them?

126
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,600
Then they won't look at your picture.

127
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,600
Yes, they will.

128
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,600
A skull is more interesting
than a naked woman.

129
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,600
If you scare them...

130
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,000
- They'll think...
- Then they think.

131
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,600
- And are still more scared.
- And fall into the arms of the priests.

132
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,500
- That's not my business.
- You're only painting your picture.

133
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:36,500
I paint life as it is.
Then folk can do as they like.

134
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,500
That makes people angry.

135
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,600
Then I paint something funny.

136
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,600
A man must live.

137
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,600
At least till the plague takes him.

138
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,600
The plague. Ugh!

139
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:55,600
You should see the abscess...

140
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:00,600
the limbs knotted in frenzy.

141
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,500
Unpleasant.

142
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:12,500
They try to tear out the boils...

143
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,500
they bite their hands...

144
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,600
scratch open their veins...

145
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,600
scream in agony.

146
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,600
Did I scare you?

147
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,600
Scared? You don't know me.

148
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,600
What's that rubbish there?

149
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:32,600
People think the plague...

150
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:36,500
is a punishment from God.

151
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:40,500
Crowds wander the land
lashing each other...

152
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,500
to please the Lord.

153
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,500
Lashing each other?

154
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,500
Yes, it's a horrible sight.

155
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,500
You feel like hiding when they pass.

156
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,600
Give me a gin.
I've had nothing but water.

157
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,600
I feel as thirsty as a desert camel.

158
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,600
Scared after all?

159
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,600
I want to confess as best I can...

160
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,500
but my heart is void.

161
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,500
The void is a mirror.

162
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:44,500
I see my face...

163
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:49,500
and feel loathing and horror.

164
00:19:55,500 --> 00:20:00,500
My indifference to men
has shut me out.

165
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,600
I live now in a world of ghosts...

166
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,600
a prisoner in my dreams.

167
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,500
- Yet you do not want to die.
- Yes, I do.

168
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,500
What are you waiting for?

169
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,500
Knowledge.

170
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,500
You want an guarantee.

171
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,500
Call it what you will.

172
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:31,500
Is it so hard to conceive God
with one's senses?

173
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,500
Why must He hide in a midst
of vague promises...

174
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,500
and invisible miracles?

175
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:43,500
How are we to believe the believers
when we don't believe ourselves?

176
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:47,500
What will become of us
who want to believe, but cannot?

177
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:51,500
And what of those
who neither will nor can believe?

178
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,500
Why can I not kill God within me?

179
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:57,500
Why does He go on living
in a painful, humiliating way?

180
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:01,500
I want to tear Him out of my heart...

181
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:05,500
but He remains a mocking reality...

182
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,500
which I cannot get rid of.

183
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,500
- Do you hear me?
- I hear you.

184
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:17,400
I want knowledge. Not belief.
Not surmise. But knowledge.

185
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,500
I want God to put out His hand...

186
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,500
show His face, speak to me.

187
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,500
But He is silent.

188
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:32,500
I cry to Him in the dark,
but there seems to be no one there.

189
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,500
Perhaps there is no one there.

190
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,500
Then life is a senseless terror.

191
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:43,500
No man can live with Death
and know that everything is nothing.

192
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,400
Most people think neither
of Death nor nothingness.

193
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,400
Until they stand on the edge of life
and see the Darkness.

194
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,500
Ah, that day.

195
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,500
I see.

196
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:59,500
We must make an idol of our fear...

197
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:03,500
and call it God.

198
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,500
You are uneasy.

199
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,500
Death visited me this morning.

200
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:13,500
We are playing chess.

201
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:17,500
This respite enables me
to perform a vital errand.

202
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,400
What errand?

203
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:23,400
My whole life has been
a meaningless search.

204
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:34,500
I say it without bitterness
or self-reproach.

205
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:37,500
I know it is the same for all.

206
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:44,500
But I want to use my respite
for one significant action.

207
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:51,400
So you play chess with Death?

208
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,400
He is a skilful tactician...

209
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,400
but I have not yet lost one piece.

210
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,400
How can you outwit Death?

211
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:07,500
By a combination
of bishop and knight...

212
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,500
I will break his flank.

213
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,500
I shall remember that.

214
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:25,400
Traitor! You have tricked me!

215
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:32,400
But I'll find a way out.

216
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,400
We will resume our game
at the inn.

217
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:49,500
This is my hand. I can move it.

218
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:52,500
The blood is pulsing in my veins.

219
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,400
The sun is still at the zenith...

220
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,400
and I, Antonius Block...

221
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,400
am playing chess with Death!

222
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:13,400
My master and I have been abroad.

223
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,500
The Crusades?

224
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:24,500
Ten years in the Holy Land...

225
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,400
bitten by snakes and flies...

226
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,400
slaughtered by savages,
poisoned by bad wine...

227
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:34,400
made lousy by women,
rotting with fever...

228
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:38,400
all for the glory of God.

229
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,400
The glory of God.

230
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:44,400
Our crusade was so stupid...

231
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,400
that only an idealist
could have thought it out.

232
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:56,500
That was horrid about the plague.

233
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,400
It's worse than that.

234
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:05,400
Whichever way we turn,
our backside's behind us.

235
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:09,400
Backside behind,
how true, how true.

236
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:17,400
Here's squire Jöns.
He grins at Death...

237
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:21,400
chuckles at the Lord,
laughs at himself...

238
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,400
and smiles at the girls.

239
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,400
His world exists only for himself.

240
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:28,500
Absurd to all, even to himself.

241
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,400
Meaningless in heaven,
indifferent in hell.

242
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:02,300
What's that stinking soup good for?

243
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,400
She has had carnal knowledge
of the Evil One.

244
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,400
And now she's in the stocks.

245
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:13,400
She's to be burnt tomorrow.
But we must keep the Devil away.

246
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:16,400
With the aid of that stinking muck?

247
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,400
Blood and gall of a black dog.

248
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:25,400
The Evil One can't stand the smell.

249
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,400
Nor can I.

250
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:39,300
Have you seen the Devil?

251
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,400
- You must not talk to her.
- Is that so dangerous?

252
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:48,400
She is thought to be the cause
of the plague.

253
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:22,400
Fate is a villain.

254
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,400
And you're a poor wretch.

255
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:28,400
Now bounding with glee.

256
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,400
Now crawling with worms.

257
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,400
Must you sing?

258
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:36,300
What?

259
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:45,400
Surprised that I steal from the dead?

260
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:47,300
A profitable trade nowadays.

261
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:54,300
It's no use telling tales.

262
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:58,300
It's everyone for himself.

263
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:06,300
Don't scream.
No one will hear you.

264
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:09,300
Isn't that surprising?

265
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:18,300
I know you.
You're Raval, the seminarist.

266
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:26,300
You're Doctor Mirabilis,
Coelestis et Diabilis.

267
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:28,300
Aren't I right?

268
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:33,300
Ten years ago
you persuaded my master...

269
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:36,300
to set off for the Holy Land.

270
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:42,300
Did I scare you?
Have you a pain in your belly?

271
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:48,300
Now I understand
these ten wasted years.

272
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:52,300
We were too well-off,
too satisfied.

273
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:54,300
The Lord wanted to chasten our pride.

274
00:30:56,300 --> 00:31:01,300
So He sent you to poison
my master's mind.

275
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:03,300
I was in good faith.

276
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:07,300
Now you know better.
You've become a thief.

277
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:12,300
A more suitable occupation
for knaves.

278
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:21,200
Oh, I am not bloodthirsty.

279
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:27,200
But next time we meet,
I will brand your face as you deserve.

280
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:32,300
I came to get my water bottle filled.

281
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:43,300
Jöns is the name.

282
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:45,300
An amiable young man...

283
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:50,300
full of noble thoughts and deeds.

284
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:01,200
Farewell, my sweet.
I could have raped you...

285
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:04,300
but I don't believe in
that kind of love.

286
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:06,300
It's a little dull in the end.

287
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:13,300
Come to think of it,
I need a housekeeper.

288
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:16,300
Can you cook?

289
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:20,300
I hope my wife is dead by now.

290
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,200
So I need a housekeeper.

291
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:31,200
Well, don't stand there gaping!
I've saved your life, you know!

292
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:50,300
Damn actors.

293
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:15,200
They're making fools of themselves.

294
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:20,200
I'm not in the first part
so I'll go behind the curtain.

295
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,200
Don't stand there gaping, ugly!

296
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:30,300
The horse is up the tree, crowing.

297
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:36,200
The road is wide but the gate narrow.

298
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:39,200
The Black One dances on the shore.

299
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:47,200
The hen mews in a lake so dark.

300
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:58,200
The day is red but the fish is dead.

301
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:02,200
The Black One squats on the shore.

302
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:09,200
The snake flaps high in the sky.

303
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:15,200
The Virgin is pale
but the mouse's content.

304
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:19,200
The Black One runs on the shore.

305
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:25,200
The goat hisses.

306
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:28,200
With his two teeth.

307
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:36,100
The blast is heavy.

308
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:39,100
The waves break.

309
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:42,200
The Black One makes dung on the shore.

310
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:48,100
The sow lays eggs and the cat grunts.

311
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:54,200
The night is soot and the dark remains.

312
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:58,200
The Black One stays, stays on the shore

313
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:24,100
God is punishing us.

314
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:32,100
We shall all perish
by the Black Death.

315
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:39,100
You there, gaping like cattle...

316
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:43,100
and you, bloated with complacency...

317
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:47,100
this might be your last hour.

318
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:54,100
Death is behind your back.

319
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:03,100
His scythe flashes above your heads.

320
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:06,100
Which of you will he strike first?

321
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:12,100
You there, with the stare of a goat...

322
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:15,100
will tonight see
your last twisted smile?

323
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:25,100
You, woman,
full of the lust of life...

324
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:31,100
will you wither before the dawn?

325
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:38,100
You, with the swollen nose...

326
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:45,100
will you pollute the earth
for another year?

327
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:49,100
Do you know, idiots,
that you are to die?

328
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:53,100
You are all doomed,
do you hear?

329
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Doomed! Doomed! Doomed!

330
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:05,100
Lord, have mercy on us sinners.

331
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:09,100
Turn not away Thy face.

332
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:15,100
For the sake of Thy son, Jesus Christ!

333
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:21,100
Do they really expect modern people...

334
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:26,100
to take that drivel seriously?

335
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,000
You laugh at me, milord.

336
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:35,000
I've read and heard
all the fairy tales.

337
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Even the ghost stories
about God the Father...

338
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Jesus Christ and the Holy Ghost.

339
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Why are you shouting?

340
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:51,100
I'm Plog, the smith,
and you're Jöns, the squire.

341
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:55,100
- That's possible.
- Have you seen my wife?

342
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:58,100
No. But if I had seen her
and she was like you...

343
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:01,100
I would hasten to forget her.

344
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
So you haven't seen her?

345
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,000
- Maybe she's run off.
- Do you know something?

346
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Quite a lot.
But nothing about your wife.

347
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Go inside, they'll tell you.

348
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:39,000
The plague is raging everywhere.
People are dying like flies.

349
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,000
I can't sell anything.

350
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,000
It's Judgement Day.
And the awful omens...

351
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,000
A woman has given birth
to a calf's head.

352
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:01,000
People are mad. They flee
and take the plague with them.

353
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:05,100
Eat, drink and be merry!

354
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Many have purged themselves
with fire and died.

355
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:17,000
But better that than hell,
the priests say.

356
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:25,000
No one dares say it aloud,
but this is the End.

357
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
People are crazy with fear.

358
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
You're scared yourself!

359
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,000
I'll warrant I am.

360
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Judgement Day.

361
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,000
The angels descend
and the graves will open.

362
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
It will be horrible.

363
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Want this? You can have it cheap.

364
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
It's real silver.

365
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Too dear for me.

366
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Excuse me, have you seen my wife?

367
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,000
- Is she missing?
- They say she's run off.

368
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,000
- Run away?
- With an actor.

369
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
If she has such bad taste,
let her go.

370
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:08,900
You are right.

371
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:11,900
I thought of killing her.

372
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Oh. Murder? That's different!

373
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,000
And the actor with her.

374
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
The actor?

375
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,000
The one she has run off with.

376
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Dense, aren't you?

377
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Oh, the actor!

378
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,000
Yes, there are far too many of them...

379
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:35,000
so you might as well kill him.

380
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:39,000
You're lying to the smith.

381
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:41,900
Me! Lying?

382
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:50,900
You're an actor too, and it's
your friend who has taken his wife.

383
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Are you an actor too?

384
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Hardly.

385
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:02,000
It's logical to kill you, too.

386
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Funny, aren't you?

387
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Pale, aren't you?
Got a bad conscience?

388
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
You are funny.

389
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Don't you think he's funny?
Oh, you don't?

390
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:16,900
Suppose we brand you.

391
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:22,900
What have you done with my wife?

392
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:41,000
You're not going to hurt me?

393
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:45,000
If I've offended anyone,
I'll go away.

394
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:50,900
Stand up and speak louder.

395
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:00,900
Stand on your head, actor!

396
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
What have you done with my wife?

397
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:19,900
Get up and dance!

398
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:21,900
I won't. I can't.

399
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:24,900
- Imitate a bear.
- I can't imitate a bear.

400
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:26,900
We shall see if you can.

401
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:27,900
Up again. Good bear.

402
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:30,900
I can't go on.

403
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
You remember what I said?

404
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:56,900
I always keep my word.

405
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:21,900
What's his name?

406
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:23,800
Michael.

407
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:25,900
How old is he?

408
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:27,900
Over a year.

409
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:31,900
- Big for his age.
- Do you think so?

410
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:38,900
- I saw your performance today.
- Was it bad?

411
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:42,900
You're prettier without make-up...

412
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:45,900
and that dress suits you better.

413
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:48,900
Skat has left us in the lurch.

414
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:51,900
Your husband?

415
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,800
No. Joseph is my husband.

416
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,800
So now there's only the two of us...

417
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:04,900
and we'll have to do tricks again.

418
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:05,900
You do tricks, too?

419
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:09,900
You bet.
Joseph is a skilful juggler.

420
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:11,900
Is Michael going to be an acrobat?

421
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:13,900
Joseph wants him to be.

422
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:15,900
But not you?

423
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:18,900
Perhaps he will be a knight!

424
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:20,900
That's not such fun either.

425
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:23,900
- No, you don't look happy.
- No.

426
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:26,900
Are you tired?

427
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:29,800
- Why?
- I'm in boring company.

428
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:33,800
- You mean your squire?
- No, not him.

429
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:35,800
- Who then?
- Myself.

430
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:39,900
Oh, I see.

431
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:41,900
Do you really?

432
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:44,900
Yes, I do quite well.

433
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:49,900
Why do people always
torment themselves?

434
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:55,900
Joseph! What is it? Where have you been?

435
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:00,800
Come sit here. Where have you been?

436
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:03,800
Let me look at you.

437
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:15,900
You've been drinking
at the tavern.

438
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:20,900
Not a drop!

439
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:23,900
You sat boasting of your angels.

440
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:28,900
I never said a word about angels.

441
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:33,900
Then you were playing
the fool again.

442
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:35,800
It makes people angry.

443
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:38,800
Look what I've brought you.

444
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:46,800
Oh, but you shouldn't!

445
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:48,800
I did, anyway.

446
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:56,900
Oh, how they hit me.

447
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:58,900
Why didn't you hit back?

448
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:00,900
I got angry...

449
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:02,900
but I never got to that.

450
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:07,800
I was so angry,
I roared like a lion.

451
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:09,800
Were they frightened?

452
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:11,800
No, they only laughed.

453
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:29,900
Doesn't he smell nice?

454
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:31,900
And he's so big. Aren't you?

455
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:34,900
He's got a real acrobat's body.

456
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:39,800
This is my husband, Joseph.

457
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:43,800
Good evening.

458
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:47,800
I was just saying
what a fine son you have.

459
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:49,800
Yes, he's fine.

460
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,400
- Have we nothing to offer our guest?
- Thank you, nothing for me.

461
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:58,800
Wild strawberries
and fresh milk.

462
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:04,900
We shall be honoured if you will share
our humble meal.

463
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:06,900
Sit down and I'll get it.

464
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:09,800
Here you are.

465
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:12,800
- Where are you making for now?
- To Elsinore.

466
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:16,800
- I advise you not to go that way.
- Why?

467
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:19,800
The plague is worse in the south.

468
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:21,800
Thousands are dying.

469
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:25,800
It never rains but it pours.

470
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:28,800
Come with me through the forest.

471
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:32,800
You'll be safer at my castle.

472
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:36,800
The strawberries
are from the hillside.

473
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:40,900
I've never seen ones so big.
Smell them.

474
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:44,800
I wish you appetite, sir.

475
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:47,800
My humble thanks.

476
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:51,800
I must think over your proposal.

477
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:54,800
It would be nice to have company.

478
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:58,800
The forest is full of evil spirits
and robbers.

479
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:02,800
Yes, but I must think it over.

480
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,800
I'm responsible for the troupe now.

481
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:09,800
After all, I am the director.

482
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:14,700
"After all, I am the director."

483
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:20,800
- Would you like some strawberries?
- That man has saved my life.

484
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:23,800
Sit down.

485
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:26,800
The knight's squire is honoured.

486
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,800
Oh, how lovely.

487
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:33,800
For a little while.

488
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:36,800
No, always. One day is like another.

489
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:39,800
That's not strange, is it?

490
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:43,800
Summer is better than winter
because you aren't cold.

491
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:46,700
But spring is best of all.

492
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:48,700
I've written a song about the spring.

493
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:51,800
Would you like to hear it?

494
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:54,800
Our guest may not care for your songs.

495
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:57,800
- Oh, yes. I write songs myself.
- You see!

496
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:01,800
There's one about an enormous fish
which you haven't heard.

497
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:04,800
And you're not going
to hear it either.

498
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:09,800
Some people don't appreciate art,
so I won't bore you. I'm sensitive.

499
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:16,700
We worry about so much.

500
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:20,700
It's better to be two.
Have you no one?

501
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:22,700
- I had once.
- And now?

502
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:25,700
I don't know.

503
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:28,800
So solemn! Was she your beloved?

504
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:33,800
We were newly-married.
We played and laughed.

505
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:37,800
I wrote songs to her eyes.

506
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:46,800
We hunted, we danced,
the house was full of life.

507
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:48,700
Will you have some strawberries?

508
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:53,700
To believe is to suffer.

509
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:56,700
It is like loving someone
in the dark...

510
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:59,700
who never answers.

511
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:05,800
How unreal that is in your company.

512
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:10,800
It means nothing to me now.

513
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:13,800
You're not so solemn now.

514
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:18,800
I shall remember this hour
of peace...

515
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:24,700
the strawberries,
the bowl of milk...

516
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:30,700
your faces in the dusk.

517
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:34,700
Michael asleep,
Joseph with his lute.

518
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:39,800
I shall remember our words...

519
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:43,800
and shall bear this memory
between my hands...

520
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:48,800
as carefully as a bowl of fresh milk.

521
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:57,700
And this will be a sign...

522
00:56:57,700 --> 00:57:00,700
and a great content.

523
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:36,700
I have been waiting.

524
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:41,700
Forgive me. I was delayed.

525
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:45,700
As I have given away my strategy,
I beat a retreat.

526
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:49,700
Here, it is your turn.

527
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:50,800
Why so pleased?

528
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:53,800
That is my secret.

529
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:55,700
Of course.

530
00:57:55,700 --> 00:57:57,700
I take your knight.

531
00:57:57,700 --> 00:58:00,700
As you were meant to.

532
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:04,700
Have you tricked me?

533
00:58:04,700 --> 00:58:08,700
You fell into the trap. Check!

534
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:11,700
Why do you laugh?

535
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:14,700
Never mind. Save your king.

536
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:17,700
You are sure of yourself.

537
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:19,700
Our game amuses me.

538
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:23,700
Your move. I am in a hurry.

539
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:26,800
I know you have much to do...

540
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:29,700
but our game must go on.

541
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:35,700
You are escorting Joseph
and his family tonight?

542
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:43,700
Why do you ask?

543
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:46,700
No reason.

544
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:58,600
Have you seen Jöns? We must go.

545
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:01,600
I think he's inside.

546
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:07,700
Well, if it isn't the smith!

547
00:59:10,700 --> 00:59:12,700
Sitting alone and crying?

548
00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:17,700
Yowling like a drowning cat.

549
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:21,700
- Is it still your wife?
- Yes, I haven't found her.

550
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:24,700
It's hell with women
and hell without.

551
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:28,700
Best to kill them
while the fun lasts.

552
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:30,600
Nagging and pig's swill.

553
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:32,600
Babies wetting themselves.

554
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:34,600
Scratches and abuse.

555
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:37,700
A witch for a mother-in-law.

556
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:40,700
And when you get into bed...

557
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:41,700
A new song.

558
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:45,700
Tears and whining.

559
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:49,700
- "Why don't you kiss me?"
- "Why don't you sing?"

560
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:51,700
"You don't love me any longer!"

561
00:59:51,700 --> 00:59:54,700
"You haven't seen my new dress!"

562
00:59:54,700 --> 00:59:58,700
- "All you do is snore!"
- Oh, hell.

563
00:59:58,700 --> 01:00:02,700
Oh, hell. And now she's gone.
Good riddance!

564
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:08,600
I'll twist their noses
with tongs.

565
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:17,700
I'll crack their skulls
on the anvil.

566
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:22,700
He's blubbing again.

567
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:24,700
Perhaps I love her.

568
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:28,700
Perhaps! Listen,
you greasy cuckold.

569
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:32,700
Love is nothing but lust
and cheating and lies.

570
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:39,600
It hurts all the same.

571
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:42,600
Love is the blackest
of all plagues.

572
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:47,600
But you don't even die of it,
and usually it passes.

573
01:00:47,700 --> 01:00:49,700
No, mine isn't passing.

574
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:52,700
Of course it will.

575
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:55,700
Only fools die of love.

576
01:00:57,700 --> 01:01:01,700
If everything is imperfect
in this world...

577
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:05,700
love is perfect in its imperfection.

578
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:09,600
You're lucky.

579
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:12,600
You believe
in your own twaddle.

580
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:15,600
Who says I believe it?

581
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:18,600
But I like giving advice.

582
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:20,600
I'm a man of learning.

583
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:25,700
Can I come with you?

584
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:29,700
They only laugh at me at home.

585
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:34,700
As long as you don't blubber.
If you do, we'll run away.

586
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:49,600
Little brother!

587
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:53,600
Look out, Jöns!
He wants to fight.

588
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:56,600
- Well, now he's crying.
- I'm sorry if I hurt you.

589
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:59,600
I've got such a confounded temper.

590
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:07,700
Come to my arms!

591
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:11,600
Later perhaps.
We're in a hurry.

592
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:09,600
Who is that over there
if not my lady...

593
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:14,600
complete with actor!

594
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:38,600
Look out now!

595
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:43,600
It is the filthy smith,
who has insulted...

596
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:45,500
the fair Kunigunda.

597
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:47,500
What did you call her?

598
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:49,600
Kunigunda! Are you deaf?

599
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:55,600
Her name is Lisa. Strumpet-Lisa.
Rump-Lisa.

600
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:00,600
How coarse he is.

601
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:06,600
Or find something better,
you gilded pimp!

602
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:07,600
What a brute!

603
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:11,600
You scabby bastard,
if I were in your lousy rags...

604
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:13,600
I would be so ashamed...

605
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:18,600
that I would creep
into a hole and die.

606
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:24,500
Watch out, you...

607
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:27,600
Dung heap.

608
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:31,600
Dung heap, or I'll...

609
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:36,600
blow you down to hell,
and you can...

610
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:39,600
Juggle.

611
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:45,600
Juggle with Old Nick's guts.

612
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:46,600
Bravo, Plog!

613
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:51,600
Watch out that I don't rip open
your belly.

614
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:54,500
Watch out that I don't punch you
in the face...

615
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:58,500
so you can't perform
for Turks and cannibals!

616
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:02,600
Why do you laugh? It's serious.

617
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:06,600
In southern lands there are things
called apes.

618
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:10,600
- What about it?
- Nothing.

619
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:12,600
Plog, my dear little Plog.

620
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:18,600
Darling Plog, forgive me.

621
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:21,600
She'll cry in a minute.

622
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:24,500
It's all so dreadful.

623
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:28,500
He has cheated me.

624
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:32,500
Look here, Kunigunda.

625
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:35,500
It will be his favourite food next!

626
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:40,600
When we get home,
I'll make you pork dumplings.

627
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:49,600
I must kill him first.

628
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:56,500
Yes, kill him properly.
I don't like him anymore.

629
01:05:56,500 --> 01:05:59,500
Lord, why did you create woman?

630
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:04,500
He's nothing but false beard,
false teeth...

631
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:06,500
false all over.

632
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:08,500
Kill him.

633
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:16,600
If you thought I would defend myself
you were wrong.

634
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:19,600
Kill me. I'll thank you afterwards!

635
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:20,600
What did you say?

636
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:24,600
The actor plays on the emotions.
That's half the battle.

637
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:27,500
Don't stand there gaping!

638
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:30,500
He must fight me,
or I can't kill him.

639
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:32,500
He must at least annoy me.

640
01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:37,500
I shall plunge this dagger
in my heart...

641
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:43,500
and my reality will become
that of a corpse.

642
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:49,500
Wait! I didn't mean any harm.

643
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:52,600
I forgive you, Kunigunda.

644
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:54,600
Farewell, my friend.

645
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:56,500
Pray for me.

646
01:07:12,500 --> 01:07:15,500
Oh dear, I didn't mean it like that.

647
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:19,500
Oh dear, I was beginning
to like him.

648
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:24,500
He's dead. The deadest actor
I've ever seen.

649
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:29,600
Oh well, he wanted to die.

650
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:32,500
And that's what I'm married to!

651
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:34,500
Now you've got
your little Lisa back.

652
01:07:36,500 --> 01:07:38,500
Aren't you happy?

653
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:42,500
Jöns, between you and me,
isn't life...

654
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:46,500
Yes. But don't think of that now.

655
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:51,500
It's a dirty mess.

656
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:01,500
I played that scene well.

657
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:12,500
Now to find a tree
where I'll be safe...

658
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:14,500
from bears, wolves and ghosts.

659
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:39,500
Tomorrow I'll find Joseph
and Mary...

660
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:42,500
and off we go
to the Saints' Festival.

661
01:08:43,500 --> 01:08:46,500
I'll warble like a little bird.

662
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:54,500
Workmen in the forest!

663
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:04,500
It's my tree!

664
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:08,400
Hey, you scurvy knave,
what are you up to?

665
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:13,400
You might at least answer.
Who are you?

666
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:18,500
I'm felling your tree.
Your time is up.

667
01:09:18,500 --> 01:09:21,500
You can't. I haven't time.

668
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:23,500
You haven't time?

669
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:27,500
No, I have my performance.

670
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:30,500
Cancelled, owing to death.

671
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:33,500
- My contract?
- Annulled.

672
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:37,400
My family...

673
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:39,400
For shame, Skat.

674
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:41,400
Yes, I'm ashamed.

675
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:48,400
Is there no exemption for actors?

676
01:09:48,500 --> 01:09:50,500
Not in your case.

677
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:55,500
No loopholes?

678
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:42,400
There's the moon.

679
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:47,400
Now we can see our way.

680
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:50,400
I don't like the moon tonight.

681
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:52,400
The trees are so still.

682
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:55,400
That's because there is no wind.

683
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:59,400
He means they're unusually still.

684
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:02,500
There's not a sound.

685
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:07,500
- If only we could hear a fox.
- Or an owl.

686
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:10,500
Or a human voice...

687
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:12,400
besides our own.

688
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:43,500
Where are you going?

689
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:46,400
- To the stake.
- Ah, yes, the witch.

690
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:50,400
Why burn her at night
when people need diversion?

691
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:53,400
Shut up, for God's sake.

692
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:56,400
The Devil is with her.

693
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:58,400
Then you are eight brave men.

694
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:02,400
We've been paid.
This is a volunteer job.

695
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:43,400
Do you hear me?

696
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:48,400
They say you've had commerce
with the Devil.

697
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:50,400
Why do you ask?

698
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:53,300
For very personal reasons.

699
01:13:55,300 --> 01:13:57,300
I, too, want to meet him.

700
01:13:57,300 --> 01:13:59,300
Why?

701
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:03,400
I must ask him about God.

702
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:05,400
Surely he knows.

703
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:12,400
You can see him any time.

704
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:13,400
How?

705
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:16,400
If you do as I say.

706
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:20,400
Look into my eyes.

707
01:14:23,300 --> 01:14:27,300
Well, do you see him?

708
01:14:27,300 --> 01:14:31,300
I see terror.

709
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:32,300
Nothing else.

710
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:39,400
Nothing? No one?

711
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:43,400
No.

712
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:47,400
Is he not behind you?

713
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:53,400
There is no one.

714
01:14:57,300 --> 01:14:59,300
He is with me everywhere.

715
01:14:59,300 --> 01:15:03,300
If I stretch out my hand,
I feel him.

716
01:15:03,300 --> 01:15:06,300
Even now.

717
01:15:06,300 --> 01:15:08,300
The fire won't hurt me.

718
01:15:08,300 --> 01:15:10,300
- Has he said so?
- I know.

719
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:14,400
- Has he said so?
- I know. I know.

720
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:16,400
You must see him, too.

721
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:20,400
The priests could see him,
and the soldiers.

722
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:23,400
They dare not touch me.

723
01:15:30,300 --> 01:15:32,300
Why have you broken her hands?

724
01:15:32,300 --> 01:15:34,300
- It is not us.
- Who?

725
01:15:34,300 --> 01:15:36,300
Ask the monk there.

726
01:15:38,300 --> 01:15:40,300
What have you done to the child?

727
01:15:45,300 --> 01:15:48,300
Will you never stop asking questions?

728
01:15:49,400 --> 01:15:53,400
No. Never.

729
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:56,400
But you get no answer.

730
01:16:13,300 --> 01:16:16,300
I did think of killing
the soldiers...

731
01:16:16,300 --> 01:16:19,300
but she's nearly dead already.

732
01:16:19,300 --> 01:16:21,300
I told you to be careful.
Don't go near her.

733
01:16:33,300 --> 01:16:36,300
This will still the pain.

734
01:17:37,300 --> 01:17:40,300
What does she see?

735
01:17:40,300 --> 01:17:44,300
- She has no pain now.
- You don't answer.

736
01:17:44,300 --> 01:17:46,300
Who will look after that child?

737
01:17:46,300 --> 01:17:50,300
The angels? God? Satan?
Emptiness?

738
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:54,300
- No, emptiness, milord!
- It cannot be.

739
01:17:54,300 --> 01:17:56,300
Look at her eyes.

740
01:17:56,300 --> 01:17:59,300
Her poor mind is making
a discovery.

741
01:18:00,300 --> 01:18:02,300
Emptiness!

742
01:18:02,300 --> 01:18:04,300
No.

743
01:18:04,300 --> 01:18:06,300
We are helpless.

744
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:10,200
We see what she sees
and her terror is ours.

745
01:18:11,300 --> 01:18:14,300
Poor child!

746
01:18:14,300 --> 01:18:16,300
I can't stand it!

747
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:36,300
He sings so sweetly
of Jesus Christ.

748
01:19:37,300 --> 01:19:41,300
In heaven there is great joy.

749
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:46,200
It will soon be dawn...

750
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:49,200
but the heat is stifling.

751
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:52,200
I'm so afraid.

752
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:55,200
We feel something will happen
to us...

753
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:58,200
but we don't know what.

754
01:19:58,300 --> 01:20:00,300
Doomsday perhaps.

755
01:20:00,300 --> 01:20:02,300
Doomsday.

756
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:16,200
Give me water!

757
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:19,200
I have the plague.

758
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:22,200
Keep on the other side
of the tree.

759
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:31,200
I am afraid to die.

760
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:34,200
I don't want to die!

761
01:20:39,300 --> 01:20:42,300
Take pity on me.

762
01:20:44,200 --> 01:20:47,200
Speak to me!

763
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:55,200
It is useless.

764
01:20:58,200 --> 01:21:00,200
I know it is!

765
01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:06,200
I am dying.

766
01:21:11,300 --> 01:21:14,300
What will happen to me?

767
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:20,200
Take pity on me.

768
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:25,200
Is there no help?

769
01:21:28,200 --> 01:21:30,200
It is useless.

770
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:36,200
Utterly useless!

771
01:21:36,200 --> 01:21:38,200
Help me!

772
01:21:38,200 --> 01:21:40,200
Do you hear? I'm consoling you.

773
01:22:07,200 --> 01:22:09,200
Shall we finish our game?

774
01:22:10,200 --> 01:22:12,200
Your move!

775
01:22:20,100 --> 01:22:22,100
I take your queen.

776
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:24,200
I didn't see that.

777
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:42,200
I see something dreadful.

778
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:44,200
- Something I can hardly tell you.
- What do you see?

779
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:47,200
The knight is playing chess
over there.

780
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:50,200
So I see. What of it?

781
01:22:50,200 --> 01:22:52,200
Don't you see who the other is?

782
01:22:52,100 --> 01:22:55,100
He's alone.
You mustn't scare me like that.

783
01:22:55,100 --> 01:22:59,100
- No, he's not alone.
- Who is it then?

784
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:03,200
He's playing chess with Death.

785
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:05,200
You mustn't say that.

786
01:23:05,200 --> 01:23:09,200
- We must flee.
- Not without him.

787
01:23:09,200 --> 01:23:14,200
They are so deep in their game
that they won't notice.

788
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:23,200
Your move, Antonius Block.

789
01:23:27,100 --> 01:23:29,100
Have you lost interest?

790
01:23:33,100 --> 01:23:35,100
On the contrary!

791
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:38,200
You look worried.

792
01:23:38,200 --> 01:23:40,200
Are you hiding something?

793
01:23:40,200 --> 01:23:43,200
Nothing escapes you.

794
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:46,200
Nothing escapes me.

795
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:48,200
No one escapes me.

796
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:52,200
I am worried, it is true.

797
01:23:53,200 --> 01:23:55,200
You are afraid.

798
01:24:03,100 --> 01:24:05,100
I've forgotten how
the pieces were.

799
01:24:08,100 --> 01:24:10,100
But I have not.

800
01:24:11,200 --> 01:24:14,200
You can't get off so easily!

801
01:24:22,200 --> 01:24:25,200
- Ah, how interesting.
- What do you see?

802
01:24:28,100 --> 01:24:30,100
You are mate at the next move.

803
01:24:34,100 --> 01:24:35,100
True.

804
01:24:37,100 --> 01:24:39,100
Did you gain by the delay?

805
01:24:39,100 --> 01:24:42,100
Yes.

806
01:24:43,100 --> 01:24:46,100
I am glad.

807
01:24:46,200 --> 01:24:48,200
When next we meet...

808
01:24:48,200 --> 01:24:53,200
the hour will strike
for you and your friends.

809
01:24:57,200 --> 01:24:59,200
And you will reveal your secrets.

810
01:25:00,100 --> 01:25:02,100
I have no secrets.

811
01:25:02,100 --> 01:25:05,100
So you know nothing?

812
01:25:06,100 --> 01:25:08,100
I am unknowing.

813
01:25:31,100 --> 01:25:33,100
What a queer light!

814
01:25:33,100 --> 01:25:36,100
It's the thunderstorm.

815
01:25:36,100 --> 01:25:39,100
No. It's something terrible.

816
01:25:39,100 --> 01:25:41,100
Do you hear the roar?

817
01:25:41,100 --> 01:25:43,100
It's only the rain.

818
01:25:46,100 --> 01:25:48,100
No. He has seen us.

819
01:25:48,100 --> 01:25:50,100
He's chasing us.

820
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:07,100
Inside, Mary! Quick!

821
01:26:13,100 --> 01:26:16,100
The Angel of Doom
is rushing past...

822
01:26:16,100 --> 01:26:19,100
and he is very big.

823
01:26:19,100 --> 01:26:21,100
How cold it is!

824
01:28:25,100 --> 01:28:29,100
I heard you were coming home...

825
01:28:30,100 --> 01:28:32,100
so I waited for you.

826
01:28:32,100 --> 01:28:34,100
The others have fled
from the plague.

827
01:28:41,100 --> 01:28:44,100
Don't you know me anymore?

828
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
You too have changed.

829
01:28:58,100 --> 01:29:01,100
Now I can see it is you.

830
01:29:02,100 --> 01:29:05,100
Hidden deep in your eyes...

831
01:29:12,100 --> 01:29:16,100
is the boy who went away
so long ago.

832
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:23,000
It is over now and I am tired.

833
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:26,000
Are you sorry you went?

834
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:30,000
No. But I am tired.

835
01:29:38,100 --> 01:29:40,100
I can see that.

836
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
Over there are my friends.

837
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:57,000
Ask them in.
I shall prepare a meal.

838
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:06,000
"And when the Lamb had opened
the seventh seal..."

839
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:11,000
"there was silence in heaven..."

840
01:30:11,100 --> 01:30:14,100
"about the space of half an hour."

841
01:30:15,100 --> 01:30:18,100
"And the seven angels..."

842
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:21,000
"which had the seven trumpets..."

843
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:25,000
"prepared themselves to sound."

844
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:41,000
"The first angel sounded,
and there followed..."

845
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:45,000
"hail and fire mingled with blood..."

846
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:49,000
"and they were cast upon the earth."

847
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:58,000
"And the third part of the trees
was burnt up..."

848
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:04,000
"and all the green grass was burnt up."

849
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:08,000
"And the second angel sounded..."

850
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:14,000
"and as it were a great mountain
burning with fire..."

851
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:17,000
"was cast into the sea."

852
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:21,000
"And the third part of the sea
became blood."

853
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
Was anyone there?

854
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:31,000
No, milord. I saw no one.

855
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:39,000
"And the third angel sounded..."

856
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:46,000
"and there fell a great star
from heaven..."

857
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:51,000
"burning as if it were a lamp."

858
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:55,000
"And the name of the star
is called Wormwood."

859
01:32:30,900 --> 01:32:33,900
Good morning, noble lord.

860
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:39,000
I am Karin, the knight's wife...

861
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:42,000
and I bid you welcome in my house.

862
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:46,000
I'm a smith by trade...

863
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:49,000
and not a bad one.

864
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:52,000
My wife Lisa.

865
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:55,000
Curtsy to the noble lord, Lisa.

866
01:32:57,000 --> 01:33:00,000
Takes a bit of handling...

867
01:32:59,900 --> 01:33:02,900
but we quarrel no worse
than others.

868
01:33:04,900 --> 01:33:07,900
Out of our darkness,
we call to Thee, O Lord!

869
01:33:07,900 --> 01:33:11,900
Oh, God, have mercy on us!

870
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:15,000
We are small and afraid
and without knowledge.

871
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:18,000
In the darkness
where you say you are...

872
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:23,000
there is none to listen to your lament.

873
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:29,000
You are reflected
in your own indifference.

874
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:35,000
God, you who are somewhere,
who must be somewhere...

875
01:33:34,900 --> 01:33:36,900
have mercy on us!

876
01:33:36,900 --> 01:33:39,900
I could have purged your worries
about eternity...

877
01:33:39,900 --> 01:33:41,900
but now it's too late.

878
01:33:41,900 --> 01:33:46,900
But feel, to the very end,
the triumph of being alive!

879
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:50,000
Quiet, quiet!

880
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:53,000
Yes, but under protest.

881
01:34:13,900 --> 01:34:15,900
It is finished.

882
01:35:10,900 --> 01:35:12,900
I see them, Mary!

883
01:35:14,900 --> 01:35:17,900
Over there against the stormy sky.

884
01:35:17,900 --> 01:35:19,900
They are all there.

885
01:35:19,900 --> 01:35:22,900
The smith and Lisa,
the knight...

886
01:35:22,900 --> 01:35:25,900
Raval, Jöns, and Skat.

887
01:35:25,900 --> 01:35:29,900
And the strict master Death
bids them dance.

888
01:35:30,900 --> 01:35:32,900
He wants them to hold hands...

889
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:37,000
and to tread the dance
in a long line.

890
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:40,000
At the head goes the strict master...

891
01:35:39,900 --> 01:35:41,900
with the scythe and hourglass.

892
01:35:41,900 --> 01:35:45,900
But the Fool brings up the rear
with his lute.

893
01:35:46,900 --> 01:35:50,900
They move away from the dawn...

894
01:35:50,900 --> 01:35:53,900
in a solemn dance...

895
01:35:53,900 --> 01:35:56,900
away towards the dark lands...

896
01:35:56,900 --> 01:36:00,900
while the rain cleanses
their cheeks...

897
01:36:00,900 --> 01:36:03,900
of the salt
from their bitter tears.

898
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
You with your visions!

898
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:31,000
