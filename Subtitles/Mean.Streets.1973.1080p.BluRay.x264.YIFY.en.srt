1
00:00:00,871 --> 00:00:03,578
You don't make up for
your sins in church.

2
00:00:03,871 --> 00:00:07,411
You do it in the streets.
You do it at home.

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:10,827
The rest is bullshit and you know it.

4
00:01:01,235 --> 00:01:02,766
<i>The night we met</i>

5
00:01:02,834 --> 00:01:07,366
<i>I knew I needed you so</i>

6
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:11,233
<i>And if I had the chance</i>

7
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:14,732
<i>I'd never let you go</i>

8
00:01:15,899 --> 00:01:18,965
<i>So won't you say you love me </i>

9
00:01:19,033 --> 00:01:22,965
<i>I'll make you so proud of me </i>

10
00:01:23,032 --> 00:01:25,964
<i>We'll make them turn their heads </i>

11
00:01:26,032 --> 00:01:28,532
<i>Every place we go</i>

12
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,998
<i>So won't you please</i>

13
00:01:30,065 --> 00:01:32,165
<i>Be my, be my baby </i>

14
00:01:32,233 --> 00:01:33,731
<i>Be my little baby</i>

15
00:01:33,798 --> 00:01:36,031
<i>My one and only baby </i>

16
00:01:36,099 --> 00:01:37,464
<i>Say you'll be my darlin'</i>

17
00:01:37,532 --> 00:01:40,131
<i>Be my, be my baby </i>

18
00:01:40,198 --> 00:01:42,598
<i>Be my baby now</i>

19
00:01:42,665 --> 00:01:45,930
<i>Whoa ho ho ho</i>

20
00:01:45,998 --> 00:01:48,896
<i>I'll make you happy, baby</i>

21
00:01:48,964 --> 00:01:51,696
<i>Just wait and see</i>

22
00:01:52,864 --> 00:01:56,630
<i>For every kiss you give me</i>

23
00:01:56,697 --> 00:01:59,330
<i>I'll give you three</i>

24
00:02:00,697 --> 00:02:04,363
<i>Oh, since the day I saw you </i>

25
00:02:04,431 --> 00:02:08,062
<i>I have been waiting for you </i>

26
00:02:08,131 --> 00:02:11,029
<i>you know I will adore you </i>

27
00:02:11,097 --> 00:02:13,028
<i>Till eternity</i>

28
00:02:13,096 --> 00:02:14,928
<i>So won't you be</i>

29
00:02:14,996 --> 00:02:16,995
<i>Be my, be my baby </i>

30
00:02:17,062 --> 00:02:18,662
<i>Be my little baby</i>

31
00:02:18,729 --> 00:02:20,861
<i>My one and only baby </i>

32
00:02:20,929 --> 00:02:22,661
<i>Say you'll be my darlin'</i>

33
00:02:22,729 --> 00:02:24,694
<i>Be my, be my baby </i>

34
00:02:24,762 --> 00:02:26,461
<i>Be my baby now</i>

35
00:02:26,529 --> 00:02:27,728
<i>My one and only baby </i>

36
00:02:27,795 --> 00:02:29,995
<i>Whoa ho ho ho</i>

37
00:02:33,961 --> 00:02:35,927
<i>Be my, be my baby </i>

38
00:02:35,995 --> 00:02:37,328
<i>Be my little baby</i>

39
00:02:37,395 --> 00:02:39,460
<i>My one and only baby </i>

40
00:02:39,528 --> 00:02:41,060
<i>Ohh</i>

41
00:02:41,129 --> 00:02:43,094
<i>Be my, be my baby </i>

42
00:02:43,162 --> 00:02:44,727
<i>Ohh</i>

43
00:02:44,794 --> 00:02:46,393
<i>My one and only baby </i>

44
00:02:46,461 --> 00:02:48,893
<i>Whoa ho ho ho</i>

45
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,727
<i>Be my, be my baby </i>

46
00:02:50,793 --> 00:02:52,193
<i>ohh</i>

47
00:02:52,261 --> 00:02:54,293
<i>My one and only baby </i>

48
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,176
<i>Ohh</i>

49
00:02:56,245 --> 00:02:57,176
<i>Be my...</i>

50
00:03:20,811 --> 00:03:23,435
What the hell is this?

51
00:03:24,102 --> 00:03:27,059
Not in my fucking place!

52
00:03:35,727 --> 00:03:38,766
Keep out of my place! I know your face!

53
00:03:38,934 --> 00:03:41,225
And you, scumbag!

54
00:03:42,267 --> 00:03:44,433
I told you about passing
that shit in my place.

55
00:03:44,642 --> 00:03:46,099
I didn't do nothing!

56
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,807
You're supposed to be the bouncer.

57
00:03:49,975 --> 00:03:53,016
- I didn't do nothing.
- That's it. You didn't do nothing.

58
00:04:13,556 --> 00:04:16,179
Come on, hurry up with that shit, huh?

59
00:04:39,929 --> 00:04:41,428
What's this, more shit?

60
00:04:41,596 --> 00:04:44,386
No, that ain't shit. That's a German lens.

61
00:04:44,554 --> 00:04:46,886
Got two shipments of those.
That's good stuff.

62
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:48,385
Can't use it.

63
00:04:48,553 --> 00:04:50,468
What do you mean you can't use it?

64
00:04:50,636 --> 00:04:53,427
That's a telescopic one.
That's the best one they make.

65
00:04:53,595 --> 00:04:57,509
It's not German, it's Jap.
This is an adaptor, it's not a lens.

66
00:04:57,677 --> 00:05:01,342
You bought two shipments
of Jap adaptors, not lenses.

67
00:05:04,594 --> 00:05:06,467
Jap adaptors.

68
00:05:51,089 --> 00:05:55,088
Lord, I'm not worthy to eat your flesh.

69
00:05:55,255 --> 00:05:56,796
Not worthy to drink your blood.

70
00:05:56,964 --> 00:05:59,462
Not worthy to drink your blood.

71
00:06:00,046 --> 00:06:01,379
Okay.

72
00:06:01,547 --> 00:06:04,587
Okay, I just come out of confession, right?
Right.

73
00:06:06,296 --> 00:06:08,044
The priest gives me the usual penance:

74
00:06:08,212 --> 00:06:11,628
Ten Hail Marys, 10 Our Fathers,
10 whatever.

75
00:06:11,795 --> 00:06:16,294
Now, you know next week I'll come back
and he'll give me another 10 Hail Marys...

76
00:06:16,461 --> 00:06:18,669
...and another 10 Our Fathers and...

77
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:21,168
I mean, you know how I feel
about that shit.

78
00:06:21,336 --> 00:06:25,793
Those things, they don't mean
anything to me. They're just words.

79
00:06:26,627 --> 00:06:30,042
Now, that may be okay for the others,
but it just doesn't work for me.

80
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:33,792
I mean, if I do something wrong,
I just want to pay for it my way.

81
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:37,084
So I do my own penance
for my own sins.

82
00:06:37,252 --> 00:06:39,084
What do you say, huh?

83
00:06:39,251 --> 00:06:43,417
It's all bullshit except the pain, right?
The pain of hell.

84
00:06:43,585 --> 00:06:46,749
The burn from a lighted match
increased a million times.

85
00:06:46,917 --> 00:06:48,416
Infinite.

86
00:06:48,584 --> 00:06:52,541
You don't fuck around with the infinite.
There's no way you do that.

87
00:06:53,417 --> 00:06:55,332
The pain in hell has two sides:

88
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,915
The kind you can touch with your hand.

89
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:00,373
The kind you can feel in your heart.

90
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:03,874
Your soul, the spiritual side.

91
00:07:04,499 --> 00:07:05,956
And you know...

92
00:07:06,457 --> 00:07:08,206
...the worst of the two...

93
00:07:08,374 --> 00:07:10,497
...is the spiritual.

94
00:07:16,998 --> 00:07:18,746
I...

95
00:07:21,914 --> 00:07:24,955
Want you back again

96
00:07:25,955 --> 00:07:27,288
I...

97
00:07:29,205 --> 00:07:33,370
Want your love again

98
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:41,495
I know you find it hard to reason with me

99
00:07:42,871 --> 00:07:45,786
But this time it's different

100
00:07:46,871 --> 00:07:49,452
Darling you'll see

101
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:53,702
You gotta tell me
You're coming back to me

102
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:57,785
You gotta tell me
You're coming back to me

103
00:07:57,953 --> 00:08:02,076
You gotta tell me
You're coming back to me

104
00:08:03,785 --> 00:08:06,118
Tell me you're coming back to me

105
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:07,868
You...

106
00:08:09,201 --> 00:08:13,534
Said we're through before

107
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:15,867
You...

108
00:08:17,201 --> 00:08:21,366
Walked out on me before

109
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:28,699
I tried to tell you
But you didn't want to know

110
00:08:29,616 --> 00:08:31,282
Hey, Charlie, you're crazy.

111
00:08:31,449 --> 00:08:34,532
- The priest taught me that.
- Terrific. You know any other tricks?

112
00:08:34,907 --> 00:08:37,531
Yeah, but I'll show them to you
when I learn this one.

113
00:08:41,949 --> 00:08:45,573
You gotta tell me
You're coming back to me

114
00:08:45,739 --> 00:08:49,905
You gotta tell me
You're coming back to me

115
00:08:50,073 --> 00:08:53,196
You know something?
She is really good-looking.

116
00:08:53,947 --> 00:08:56,655
I gotta say that again.
She is really good-looking.

117
00:08:58,322 --> 00:09:00,154
But she's black.

118
00:09:00,613 --> 00:09:02,821
You can see that real plain, right?

119
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:06,487
Look, there's not much
of a difference anyway, is there?

120
00:09:06,655 --> 00:09:09,028
Well, is there?

121
00:09:10,654 --> 00:09:17,152
I hear the knock
On my door that never comes

122
00:09:17,737 --> 00:09:19,944
- Oh, great.
- Great.

123
00:09:20,112 --> 00:09:21,278
Hey, Marlboro?

124
00:09:21,444 --> 00:09:24,819
For these prices, Charlie,
you shouldn't complain.

125
00:09:24,987 --> 00:09:28,360
That's the best I could do.
Maybe next week I can do better.

126
00:09:29,111 --> 00:09:32,402
If you can't smoke them,
maybe you can sell them.

127
00:09:33,111 --> 00:09:34,985
No, I'll be okay for a week.

128
00:09:35,152 --> 00:09:36,359
Bless you.

129
00:09:36,777 --> 00:09:38,818
You seen Johnny Boy?

130
00:09:38,985 --> 00:09:40,359
No.

131
00:09:40,527 --> 00:09:42,109
He's supposed to be here.

132
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,942
But who knows what goes on
in that kid's head, right?

133
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:48,608
I'd like to know, Charlie.
I think the kid's trying to duck me.

134
00:09:49,734 --> 00:09:52,567
Think you ought to care more
about Johnny's payments to me?

135
00:09:52,733 --> 00:09:54,441
I think you should. You know that.

136
00:09:54,608 --> 00:09:57,899
Michael, Michael,
nobody's out to screw you.

137
00:09:58,067 --> 00:09:59,274
I guarantee that.

138
00:10:00,191 --> 00:10:02,099
Well, you're not looking
at it from my side.

139
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,607
You vouched for the kid.

140
00:10:03,774 --> 00:10:06,439
What happens if he doesn't pay?
I gotta collect from you?

141
00:10:07,108 --> 00:10:09,439
- I don't wanna do that.
- You're right.

142
00:10:10,274 --> 00:10:12,064
I made a deal with him, not you.

143
00:10:12,232 --> 00:10:14,439
Right. I'm not gonna pay his debts,
believe me.

144
00:10:14,607 --> 00:10:17,064
- I'll straighten him out.
- Straighten him out?

145
00:10:17,232 --> 00:10:20,897
- The bum owes money left and right.
- Don't worry, Michael...

146
00:10:21,064 --> 00:10:23,522
Hey! Hey, come on!

147
00:10:25,106 --> 00:10:27,563
- Get out of here!
- Come on.

148
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:29,479
- Come on, sit down.
- Take it easy.

149
00:10:29,689 --> 00:10:33,521
- What's the matter with you?
- Everybody's friends here, right?

150
00:10:33,689 --> 00:10:35,062
Come on, sit down.

151
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:37,937
You know, Charlie,
I don't understand you.

152
00:10:38,188 --> 00:10:40,937
I don't understand why you hang around
with a punk kid.

153
00:10:41,105 --> 00:10:42,895
He's the biggest jerk-off around.

154
00:10:43,062 --> 00:10:45,186
Don't say that.
Don't call him that, will you?

155
00:10:45,354 --> 00:10:46,894
What's the matter?

156
00:10:47,604 --> 00:10:50,477
Family things, it's complicated.
I can't explain it, all right? Ahem.

157
00:10:50,645 --> 00:10:52,435
But really, he's a good kid.

158
00:10:52,603 --> 00:10:55,602
All right, sure. I'll see you.

159
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:58,185
Right, later. Be well.

160
00:11:07,143 --> 00:11:10,268
Come on, girls. Give her your coats.
Give her your coats.

161
00:11:13,102 --> 00:11:16,350
If you don't mind, young lady,
I would like to check these.

162
00:11:18,268 --> 00:11:22,433
But I'm keeping my skin pants.

163
00:11:22,809 --> 00:11:25,224
- Hey!
- Hey, here he is!

164
00:11:25,392 --> 00:11:28,182
Hey. Hey. Whoo!

165
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:32,723
Are those the shorts
with the hearts on them?

166
00:11:34,141 --> 00:11:35,640
Girls, after you.

167
00:11:35,808 --> 00:11:37,662
All right, okay.
Thanks a lot, Lord.

168
00:11:37,663 --> 00:11:39,515
Thanks a lot for
opening my eyes.

169
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:42,931
We talk about penance
and you send this through the door.

170
00:11:43,765 --> 00:11:45,973
Well, we play by your rules, don't we?

171
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,639
Well, don't we?

172
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:43,175
- Hey.
- Hey.

173
00:12:43,343 --> 00:12:44,425
Giovannino.

174
00:12:44,593 --> 00:12:46,425
- How are you?
- All right. How are you?

175
00:12:46,593 --> 00:12:49,259
I want you to meet
two beautiful young ladies here.

176
00:12:49,426 --> 00:12:50,925
This is my good friend Charlie.

177
00:12:51,093 --> 00:12:53,341
This is my good friend Tony,
he owns the joint.

178
00:12:53,509 --> 00:12:54,967
This is... What's your name?

179
00:12:55,133 --> 00:12:57,258
- Sarah.
- Sarah. Sarah Kline, right?

180
00:12:57,467 --> 00:13:00,091
Sarah Kline, this is Tony.

181
00:13:00,259 --> 00:13:01,882
- And what's your name?
- Heather.

182
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:04,298
Heather. Heather Weintraub, right?

183
00:13:08,758 --> 00:13:11,257
- I met them in the Village.
- Bohemian.

184
00:13:11,424 --> 00:13:12,965
Yeah, over at the Cafe Bizarre.

185
00:13:15,423 --> 00:13:18,130
- So, what do youse want to drink, girls?
- Tequila.

186
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:20,964
- You got tequila?
- No.

187
00:13:21,298 --> 00:13:23,256
Never mind. Listen...

188
00:13:23,423 --> 00:13:26,089
Have a Seven and Seven,
it's good for both of youse.

189
00:13:26,256 --> 00:13:29,797
Tony, give yourself a drink. Give Charlie
and me a J&B, will you, please?

190
00:13:29,964 --> 00:13:31,255
- What's this?
- What's what?

191
00:13:31,422 --> 00:13:33,296
- This.
- What?

192
00:13:33,464 --> 00:13:36,255
- That. What does this look like? Huh?
- What?

193
00:13:36,421 --> 00:13:38,088
Where did you get this?

194
00:13:38,255 --> 00:13:40,003
- What?
- Where did you get this?

195
00:13:40,171 --> 00:13:42,087
- This.
- What?

196
00:13:42,255 --> 00:13:44,962
- This?
- Yeah. In the back, come on.

197
00:13:45,129 --> 00:13:47,128
- Hey, hey.
- Come on.

198
00:13:47,295 --> 00:13:49,087
What are you doing? Heh, heh.

199
00:13:49,254 --> 00:13:53,877
Hey, you're making me look bad, Charlie.
Ha, ha. In front of the girls over here.

200
00:13:54,045 --> 00:13:56,752
Oh, excuse me.
I didn't mean to be rude, girls.

201
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:00,836
Mr. Civello, I'd like your presence
in the back room, if you got a moment.

202
00:14:01,294 --> 00:14:05,085
What, you mean you request my presence
for a moment or two in the back room?

203
00:14:05,253 --> 00:14:06,377
I most certainly do.

204
00:14:06,544 --> 00:14:07,918
Well, after you.

205
00:14:08,086 --> 00:14:09,543
- No, after you.
- No, after you.

206
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:12,876
- Hey, Mr. Civello, after you.
- No, after you.

207
00:14:13,043 --> 00:14:14,834
- In the back!
- Ha, ha, ha.

208
00:14:15,585 --> 00:14:18,583
Tony, give them whatever they want.

209
00:14:18,876 --> 00:14:21,084
Hey, girls. Hey, girls, excuse me.

210
00:14:21,251 --> 00:14:23,708
Tony, keep an eye
on these nice girls here.

211
00:14:23,876 --> 00:14:25,999
Don't let none of the vultures look, okay?

212
00:14:26,417 --> 00:14:28,416
- What are you doing?
- What do you mean?

213
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:30,707
- What are you doing to me?
- What do you mean?

214
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:33,290
Michael's on my back all night.
He's bothering me.

215
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:35,749
Why didn't you make your payment
last Tuesday?

216
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:38,499
I made my payment.
What are you talking about?

217
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:40,873
- You paid him last week?
- Yeah, I paid him.

218
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:44,040
What did he say, I didn't pay?
He's a fucking liar. Where is he?

219
00:14:44,457 --> 00:14:46,331
- You paid him?
- Yeah, I paid him.

220
00:14:46,499 --> 00:14:48,248
- Last week?
- Yeah!

221
00:14:48,624 --> 00:14:50,831
- Last Tuesday?
- Yeah.

222
00:14:51,332 --> 00:14:52,956
- You don't know...
- He's here.

223
00:14:53,123 --> 00:14:54,747
- Where?
- Out front.

224
00:14:54,915 --> 00:14:56,121
- He's here?
- Yeah.

225
00:14:56,289 --> 00:14:57,580
So, what do I care?

226
00:14:57,748 --> 00:15:00,788
Let me go get him.
We'll straighten this thing out, all right?

227
00:15:01,373 --> 00:15:02,704
Hey, wait a minute, Charlie.

228
00:15:03,081 --> 00:15:05,038
- What?
- Well, you're right.

229
00:15:05,206 --> 00:15:08,412
- I'm right?
- Yeah, was it last Tuesday?

230
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:11,995
The Tuesday that was last week
that's before the one about to come up.

231
00:15:12,163 --> 00:15:15,912
My mistake, I'm sorry. It was last week...
The week before that I was thinking of.

232
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,453
- Oh, yeah. It was, huh?
- That's right. That's right.

233
00:15:18,621 --> 00:15:21,578
What's the matter with you?
You can't bullshit people that way.

234
00:15:21,745 --> 00:15:23,537
You give your word, you gotta keep it.

235
00:15:23,703 --> 00:15:26,410
You know what happened?
I'm depressed about other things.

236
00:15:26,578 --> 00:15:28,494
I can't worry about payments, you know?

237
00:15:28,829 --> 00:15:32,244
I come home last Tuesday. I had my money
in cash, you know? Blah-blah, bing-bing.

238
00:15:32,578 --> 00:15:34,576
Coming home, I ran into Jimmy Sparks.

239
00:15:34,744 --> 00:15:37,409
I owe him 700, like for four months.
I gotta pay the guy.

240
00:15:37,577 --> 00:15:40,201
He lives in my building,
hangs out across the street.

241
00:15:40,369 --> 00:15:41,618
- Yeah.
- So, what happened?

242
00:15:41,786 --> 00:15:43,409
I had to give some to my mother.

243
00:15:43,577 --> 00:15:45,575
I wound up with 25
at the end of the week.

244
00:15:45,743 --> 00:15:48,159
And today, you won't believe,
it's just incredible.

245
00:15:48,326 --> 00:15:50,076
- I can't believe it myself.
- What?

246
00:15:50,243 --> 00:15:52,867
I was in a game.
I was ahead like 6-, 700 dollars, right?

247
00:15:53,034 --> 00:15:55,658
- You're kidding?
- On Esther Street. You know Joey Clams?

248
00:15:55,826 --> 00:15:56,866
Joey Scala, yeah.

249
00:15:57,326 --> 00:15:59,908
- I know him too, yeah.
- No, Joey Scala is Joey Clams.

250
00:16:00,076 --> 00:16:01,407
- Right.
- Right.

251
00:16:01,575 --> 00:16:03,241
- They're the same person.
- Yeah.

252
00:16:03,408 --> 00:16:04,865
- Hey.
- Hey.

253
00:16:05,033 --> 00:16:08,407
So I was in there playing
bankers and brokers. All of a sudden...

254
00:16:08,574 --> 00:16:10,949
...I'm ahead 6-, 700 dollars.
I'm really winning.

255
00:16:11,116 --> 00:16:15,073
All of a sudden some kid walks in
and yells that the bulls are coming, right?

256
00:16:15,241 --> 00:16:18,323
Cops are coming. Everybody runs away.
I grab the money. I go in.

257
00:16:18,491 --> 00:16:20,073
It's an excuse, like to get away.

258
00:16:20,241 --> 00:16:23,031
I'd give everybody the money later,
and that way I'd get out.

259
00:16:23,198 --> 00:16:25,988
I don't have to get into the game
and get a losing streak.

260
00:16:26,156 --> 00:16:28,614
I come out in the yard,
I don't know this building.

261
00:16:28,781 --> 00:16:31,239
I couldn't get out. It was like a box.

262
00:16:31,405 --> 00:16:33,446
Big, like this. So I gotta go back in.

263
00:16:33,614 --> 00:16:37,530
Not only do I go back in,
but this kid says it's a false alarm.

264
00:16:37,697 --> 00:16:41,862
Imagine that? I wanted to kill
this fucking kid. I mean, I want... Ugh!

265
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,987
I was so crazy, I wanted to kill this kid.

266
00:16:44,363 --> 00:16:48,903
Meanwhile, I gotta get back in the game.
Bing-bing-bing. I lose $400.

267
00:16:49,154 --> 00:16:51,403
Meanwhile, Frankie Bones is over there.

268
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:53,778
I owe him 1300 for seven,
eight months already.

269
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:56,778
I can't walk on Esther Street
without ducking that guy.

270
00:16:56,946 --> 00:16:59,611
He's, like, waiting for me.
Like I can't move, you know.

271
00:16:59,779 --> 00:17:02,486
He sees that I'm losing, right?
So he's waiting for me.

272
00:17:02,653 --> 00:17:04,361
He's tapping me on the shoulder.

273
00:17:04,528 --> 00:17:06,652
Tapping me like this. Like a hawk.

274
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,693
"You're losing. Give me some money."

275
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:12,776
I say, "Frankie, come on. Give me a break
over here. Let me win some back.

276
00:17:12,944 --> 00:17:14,943
I got debts. I'm in a big hole."

277
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:17,901
He says, "Never mind, give me the money."
I say, "Okay."

278
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:20,234
So I gave him 200.
Meanwhile, I lost the deal.

279
00:17:20,527 --> 00:17:21,983
I go outside, I'm depressed...

280
00:17:22,151 --> 00:17:24,817
I'll cut the story short.
You don't want to hear all this.

281
00:17:24,984 --> 00:17:27,483
I know, I know, I know.
To make a long story short.

282
00:17:27,651 --> 00:17:29,733
Anyway, I went to Al Kaplan.

283
00:17:29,901 --> 00:17:33,024
Got a new tie, got this shirt.
You like the shirt?

284
00:17:33,192 --> 00:17:34,566
It's nice. This tie...

285
00:17:34,775 --> 00:17:38,482
Michael doesn't care if you're depressed.
What is he, your priest?

286
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:41,816
Why are you going shopping
when you owe money? That ain't right.

287
00:17:41,982 --> 00:17:43,106
How much you got there?

288
00:17:43,274 --> 00:17:45,440
I'm gonna pay him next week.
I'm gonna pay him!

289
00:17:45,608 --> 00:17:48,606
You're gonna and you don't do nothing.
How much you got there?

290
00:17:48,774 --> 00:17:51,648
I got about... I got another $40.

291
00:17:51,816 --> 00:17:53,189
What are you doing?

292
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:58,189
I got about $40 there. That's all.

293
00:18:02,023 --> 00:18:03,897
What? What are you doing?

294
00:18:04,064 --> 00:18:07,313
I'm holding on to this till next week,
till you make the next payment.

295
00:18:07,481 --> 00:18:09,646
What? There's a little more than 40?

296
00:18:09,814 --> 00:18:11,479
- It's a mistake.
- Yeah, a mistake.

297
00:18:11,647 --> 00:18:15,354
Hey, listen, I swear to my mother,
you come with me next Tuesday...

298
00:18:15,522 --> 00:18:19,437
...I sign the paycheck over to you. I swear
to my mother, swear to Christ, okay?

299
00:18:19,604 --> 00:18:21,561
Come on, it's $110.
You give it to Michael.

300
00:18:21,729 --> 00:18:24,561
Come on, give me some money.
We got those beautiful girls.

301
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:28,811
We're gonna get laid.
I met those chicks in that Cafe Bizarre.

302
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:31,477
They were fucking around
with these two other guys.

303
00:18:31,812 --> 00:18:35,393
That one, Weintraub, is very nice.
Very nice. I want to bang her like crazy.

304
00:18:35,561 --> 00:18:36,894
Here.

305
00:18:37,436 --> 00:18:38,935
- Come on.
- That's enough for you.

306
00:18:39,102 --> 00:18:42,726
- Come on, give me another 5. Come on.
- Which one do you want?

307
00:18:44,519 --> 00:18:46,768
You're leaving me nothing.
We gotta go eat chinks?

308
00:18:46,936 --> 00:18:49,184
- Make do for this for the week.
- All right.

309
00:18:49,352 --> 00:18:51,476
- Which one do you want?
- Which one do you want?

310
00:18:51,643 --> 00:18:54,017
I want Weintraub.
She's nice. I like that one.

311
00:18:54,185 --> 00:18:55,517
She's the one on the left?

312
00:18:56,018 --> 00:18:58,600
No, she's the one... Your left or my left?

313
00:18:59,142 --> 00:19:01,933
- We were both standing the same way.
- It don't matter.

314
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,975
Hey, girls, we
had a little business

315
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,849
to talk over.
Everything's okay now.

316
00:19:06,017 --> 00:19:07,766
Excuse me for a minute.

317
00:19:07,934 --> 00:19:10,557
Hey, Tony, you think maybe
you could put this on the tab?

318
00:19:10,725 --> 00:19:15,598
Because something happened before.
You'll be doing me a favor, you know?

319
00:19:15,766 --> 00:19:18,098
- Huh?
- Big tab or the little tab?

320
00:19:18,265 --> 00:19:21,640
Don't you think it's better
that you should put it on the small tab...

321
00:19:21,808 --> 00:19:24,680
...so that it balances out
with the big tab?

322
00:19:25,307 --> 00:19:27,847
- Oh, so things even out?
- Yeah, right.

323
00:19:28,015 --> 00:19:30,889
Joey, where'd you get those beads?

324
00:19:31,057 --> 00:19:32,971
How about me, John?
I don't get a drink?

325
00:19:33,139 --> 00:19:35,555
- Hey, Mikey.
- Long time no see.

326
00:19:35,722 --> 00:19:37,263
You don't get a drink?

327
00:19:37,431 --> 00:19:40,055
- Does a bear shit in the woods over here?
- Ha, ha, ha.

328
00:19:40,223 --> 00:19:41,304
Go ahead.

329
00:19:45,055 --> 00:19:47,054
Give him a double.
Tony, give him a double.

330
00:19:47,222 --> 00:19:50,054
- Long time no see.
- I know what you'll say, but don't.

331
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:52,887
One, I'm not paying for these drinks.
They're on the tab.

332
00:19:53,055 --> 00:19:55,678
Two, I'll see youse Tuesday payday,
I swear on my mother.

333
00:19:55,845 --> 00:20:00,053
Not on my mother,
but Jesus Christ and... Okay?

334
00:20:00,221 --> 00:20:02,719
All right, I just wanna tell you
to stay on top of it.

335
00:20:02,887 --> 00:20:04,969
- I will.
- We don't want it to get out of hand.

336
00:20:05,136 --> 00:20:08,260
- Don't worry, it ain't gonna get
out of hand. - I'm doing it for you.

337
00:20:08,428 --> 00:20:09,718
- Have a drink.
- Okay.

338
00:20:09,886 --> 00:20:11,551
Gentlemen.

339
00:20:11,928 --> 00:20:13,219
- The queen.
- The queen.

340
00:20:13,385 --> 00:20:14,843
- Queen.
- Queen.

341
00:20:18,302 --> 00:20:21,759
You know what the queen said?
"If I had balls I'd be the king."

342
00:20:21,927 --> 00:20:23,717
Ooh.

343
00:20:23,927 --> 00:20:25,009
Tssh.

344
00:20:37,051 --> 00:20:39,257
Hey, they told me you were here,
and you're here.

345
00:20:39,425 --> 00:20:42,216
- Hey.
- How are you? How's the classes going?

346
00:20:42,383 --> 00:20:45,049
Okay, Oscar.
How's everything going with you?

347
00:20:45,217 --> 00:20:48,715
I was in the basement fixing the freezer.
Would you believe that?

348
00:20:48,883 --> 00:20:52,298
Charlie, you're a good boy.
Will you tell your uncle I have nothing?

349
00:20:52,466 --> 00:20:54,381
I can't make this week's payment.

350
00:20:55,882 --> 00:20:58,089
Listen, you talk to Giovanni, not me.

351
00:20:58,256 --> 00:21:01,672
I should hand this place over to him.
I don't need this aggravation.

352
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:05,214
He'd rather have the loan paid.
You know that, Oscar.

353
00:21:05,381 --> 00:21:07,338
Your uncle's a good man.
I won't stick him.

354
00:21:07,506 --> 00:21:09,630
He either gets the money
or he gets the place.

355
00:21:09,798 --> 00:21:11,921
Right now it looks like
he's getting the place.

356
00:21:12,088 --> 00:21:14,962
You tell me why I should care.
I got a partner who is a bum.

357
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:16,379
He disappears!

358
00:21:16,546 --> 00:21:18,337
I don't understand. Where's Groppi?

359
00:21:18,505 --> 00:21:20,796
I should know? His wife don't even know.

360
00:21:20,963 --> 00:21:23,504
If he don't give a damn,
why should I kill myself?

361
00:21:26,046 --> 00:21:28,045
Thank you very much, Natalie!

362
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:10,374
How are you feeling?

363
00:22:17,082 --> 00:22:20,123
About that shooting last night,
I was there, uncle.

364
00:22:20,291 --> 00:22:22,165
No, you were not.

365
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:25,956
Yes, I must have confused it
with something else.

366
00:22:26,124 --> 00:22:27,748
Yes, you did.

367
00:22:29,248 --> 00:22:30,706
So?

368
00:22:31,373 --> 00:22:32,955
About Oscar.

369
00:22:33,415 --> 00:22:37,080
I think he's putting on this act
about the restaurant being in bad shape.

370
00:22:37,247 --> 00:22:41,246
He says he can't make the payments.
He says his partner has disappeared.

371
00:22:42,498 --> 00:22:44,205
What should I do?

372
00:22:45,538 --> 00:22:47,205
Don't do anything.

373
00:22:47,371 --> 00:22:48,662
His business is bad.

374
00:22:49,079 --> 00:22:50,746
Can I help?

375
00:22:51,913 --> 00:22:54,578
Yeah, you can help by waiting.

376
00:22:55,537 --> 00:22:57,369
Don't be impatient.

377
00:22:57,537 --> 00:22:59,369
You like restaurants?

378
00:22:59,788 --> 00:23:01,745
Yes, sure.

379
00:23:03,995 --> 00:23:07,702
Oh, you know what I do have?
I got a good buy on toilet paper now.

380
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:09,660
Leave me alone. Leave me alone.

381
00:23:11,161 --> 00:23:13,535
What kind of toilet paper? I get Scott.

382
00:23:13,703 --> 00:23:16,160
No, I got toilet paper
coming from the PX, the Army.

383
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:18,118
Now you're stealing from the Army?

384
00:23:18,286 --> 00:23:21,367
- I can get it cheap. You want it?
- Steal from the American Army.

385
00:23:21,535 --> 00:23:24,659
- Army of the United States of America.
- Hey, you sell firecrackers?

386
00:23:24,826 --> 00:23:26,992
What? Come here.

387
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,784
- What do you want?
- Firecrackers.

388
00:23:28,951 --> 00:23:30,201
No, that's illegal.

389
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:32,658
We went to Chinatown.
They don't have any stuff.

390
00:23:32,826 --> 00:23:35,158
Keep away from those chinks.
All they have is shit.

391
00:23:35,326 --> 00:23:36,450
We have $40.

392
00:23:36,618 --> 00:23:39,699
Well, why didn't you say so? For $40...

393
00:23:39,867 --> 00:23:42,200
We don't know
if we want to spend all $40.

394
00:23:42,366 --> 00:23:44,824
- You want good stuff or shit?
- We want good stuff.

395
00:23:44,991 --> 00:23:47,199
You know where this stuff comes from?
Maryland.

396
00:23:47,366 --> 00:23:50,032
- You know what that means?
- That means it's good.

397
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,907
- Tony, we borrow your car?
- Sure.

398
00:23:52,074 --> 00:23:53,698
Come on. Across the street.

399
00:23:53,866 --> 00:23:55,032
- You got sparklers?
- Yes.

400
00:23:55,199 --> 00:23:57,239
- Cherry bombs? Ash cans?
- Yes. yes.

401
00:23:57,407 --> 00:23:58,989
- Cones?
- Cones, yes.

402
00:23:59,157 --> 00:24:00,198
Women?

403
00:24:01,199 --> 00:24:04,697
What are you, a comedian?
Comedians, Tony.

404
00:24:06,032 --> 00:24:07,489
Thank you.

405
00:24:15,072 --> 00:24:17,404
- Nice car.
- Yeah, well...

406
00:24:18,113 --> 00:24:19,945
Must've cost a lot.

407
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:24,196
You got a good buy on this,
didn't you? You need a tune-up there, Tony.

408
00:24:25,155 --> 00:24:26,737
You kids come down for the feast?

409
00:24:26,905 --> 00:24:28,528
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

410
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:32,612
Now what we're gonna do is let you
out right over there on that corner.

411
00:24:32,779 --> 00:24:35,195
- We'll come back for you.
- Can we come with you?

412
00:24:35,362 --> 00:24:38,153
No. See, I can't let anybody see
where I got the stuff.

413
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,027
That's good business,
you know what I'm saying?

414
00:24:41,195 --> 00:24:43,860
- Be back in about 30 minutes.
- Okay.

415
00:24:44,028 --> 00:24:47,277
Wait, wait, wait. What about the cash?

416
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:48,735
Take a check?

417
00:24:48,903 --> 00:24:50,777
Take a check?

418
00:24:51,027 --> 00:24:53,318
- Where are you guys from?
- Riverdale.

419
00:24:53,486 --> 00:24:57,109
Maybe that's what they do up in Riverdale,
but down here we gotta take cash.

420
00:24:57,277 --> 00:24:59,234
Now, you got it or you don't got it.

421
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:02,609
Okay, here.

422
00:25:03,901 --> 00:25:07,941
All right, now wait over there
and keep your mouth shut.

423
00:25:13,901 --> 00:25:16,357
Checks? Tony, you take checks, right?

424
00:25:16,567 --> 00:25:19,274
Sure, I take checks.
How much did we get?

425
00:25:19,441 --> 00:25:22,690
You know, I don't know.
Let me see here. What do we got here?

426
00:25:22,858 --> 00:25:24,523
What do we got here? Mathematician.

427
00:25:24,691 --> 00:25:29,023
One, two, three, four, five, 10, 15.

428
00:25:29,191 --> 00:25:32,064
What do you know,
we got stiffed by them kids.

429
00:25:32,232 --> 00:25:34,981
They only gave me $20.

430
00:25:35,565 --> 00:25:37,063
Here.

431
00:25:37,981 --> 00:25:40,189
Take 5.
Tell you what, I'll write you a check.

432
00:25:40,356 --> 00:25:44,022
- I'll tell you what, get out of the car.
- I'll tell you what, take the 5.

433
00:25:44,189 --> 00:25:46,062
- Give me the 5.
- Okay.

434
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:47,354
Let's go to the movies.

435
00:25:47,522 --> 00:25:49,062
And the movie's on you.

436
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:52,562
Pull over here. Pull over here.
There he is. There he is. Hey!

437
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:53,771
Hey, Michael.

438
00:25:53,938 --> 00:25:55,771
Charlie, get in the car. Come here.

439
00:25:55,938 --> 00:25:58,479
- Coming in?
- No, come here.

440
00:25:58,646 --> 00:26:01,479
Sal, I'll see you tomorrow, right?
Frankie, be good.

441
00:26:03,604 --> 00:26:06,103
- What's the matter?
- We just stiffed a couple of kids.

442
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:07,978
- How much you take them for?
- Twenty.

443
00:26:08,145 --> 00:26:11,436
What are you laughing about? Twenty?
Let's go to the movies.

444
00:26:11,895 --> 00:26:14,352
- And the movie's on you.
- What are you talking about?

445
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:16,227
- This is my business.
- Believe it.

446
00:26:31,059 --> 00:26:33,017
- You guys better enjoy yourselves.
- Heh, heh, heh.

447
00:26:33,185 --> 00:26:34,850
It's costing me a lot of money.

448
00:26:35,018 --> 00:26:37,892
Hey, get your hands off me, man.
Leave me alone!

449
00:26:38,059 --> 00:26:39,516
I ain't doing nothing, lady.

450
00:26:39,684 --> 00:26:42,057
Give me a break,
I'm trying to watch the picture.

451
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:45,849
You watch it. I'll get the manager
in here. He'll throw you out in the street.

452
00:26:46,017 --> 00:26:48,057
Go ahead. Go get the fucking manager.

453
00:26:48,225 --> 00:26:49,640
- He's a fruit.
- You're a fruit.

454
00:26:49,808 --> 00:26:51,891
Me? I'm a fruit?

455
00:27:00,141 --> 00:27:03,681
It feels good, huh, Charlie?
Streets are empty. Nice.

456
00:27:03,849 --> 00:27:07,264
I mean, with that feast on, you can't
even move in your own neighborhood.

457
00:27:07,432 --> 00:27:09,139
I hate that feast with a passion.

458
00:27:09,307 --> 00:27:12,346
Hey, never mind the feast.
Just remember, I'll do the talking.

459
00:27:12,514 --> 00:27:14,430
That's the trouble. You do the talking.

460
00:27:14,598 --> 00:27:17,180
Don't fool around, John.
Jimmy asked me to settle this.

461
00:27:17,347 --> 00:27:20,263
- How much do they owe him?
- I don't know, a couple of hundred.

462
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:23,637
Look at this character.
Hasn't taken a bath since last Christmas.

463
00:27:23,805 --> 00:27:25,846
He's probably an ex-judge.

464
00:27:26,263 --> 00:27:27,512
He's the mayor's aide.

465
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,928
- Where's he gonna meet us?
- In the pool hall.

466
00:27:30,096 --> 00:27:31,595
- Near Sullivan Street?
- Yeah.

467
00:27:31,763 --> 00:27:34,137
No, it's on King Street.
What are you doing?

468
00:27:34,304 --> 00:27:35,928
Show me where. I don't know my way.

469
00:27:36,095 --> 00:27:40,511
Make a right turn over here at the green,
when the light turns green.

470
00:27:41,636 --> 00:27:44,011
Next time Jimmy don't bet
outside the neighborhood.

471
00:27:44,179 --> 00:27:47,677
Come on with this light. What is this,
a coffee-and-cake light over here?

472
00:27:48,844 --> 00:27:51,760
John, you wanna keep your father away
from the car, please?

473
00:27:56,469 --> 00:27:59,509
It'll be okay. I know these guys.
They're not gonna stiff him.

474
00:27:59,677 --> 00:28:00,981
How do you know?

475
00:28:00,982 --> 00:28:02,884
Shut your mouth.
I'll take care of it.

476
00:28:03,051 --> 00:28:05,592
- Just don't say nothing.
- I'm not saying nothing.

477
00:28:07,051 --> 00:28:09,717
- Where the fuck is he?
- Here he is.

478
00:28:10,217 --> 00:28:11,633
Charlie.

479
00:28:13,009 --> 00:28:14,924
Listen, the number I bet was 235.

480
00:28:15,092 --> 00:28:17,299
I bet a combination.
I dreamt of my grandfather.

481
00:28:17,467 --> 00:28:19,340
- How much did you bet?
- What did I say?

482
00:28:19,508 --> 00:28:20,674
What?

483
00:28:20,842 --> 00:28:22,340
Calm down.

484
00:28:23,008 --> 00:28:24,840
Clark, you seen Joey Gatucci around?

485
00:28:25,008 --> 00:28:26,882
Yeah, he's in the back room.

486
00:28:27,841 --> 00:28:30,548
When he died, the number
on the funeral parlor was 235...

487
00:28:30,716 --> 00:28:33,922
...so I figured I had a good bet,
you know? So I placed it...

488
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:35,214
Hey, Joey.

489
00:28:35,382 --> 00:28:39,422
Well, well, well, Saint Charles is here.
Everybody, benediction!

490
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:41,714
Hey, you may rise. Rise, please.

491
00:28:41,882 --> 00:28:44,380
Thank you.
My good friend Tootie over here.

492
00:28:44,548 --> 00:28:46,671
Tootie. Tootie.

493
00:28:48,505 --> 00:28:51,212
- You can't lose with that.
- How about Mushy?

494
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:54,045
- Mushy. Here's one for the lamp.
- One for the lamp.

495
00:28:54,213 --> 00:28:56,837
Mushy, this will definitely
get you to Hollywood.

496
00:28:57,005 --> 00:28:59,004
- The chalkboard.
- Chalkboard.

497
00:28:59,172 --> 00:29:00,920
- The pool cues.
- The pool cues.

498
00:29:01,088 --> 00:29:03,879
How about the balls? Bless my balls.

499
00:29:04,087 --> 00:29:06,587
- Yeah, bless his balls.
- Hey.

500
00:29:07,296 --> 00:29:09,420
- How you been, Joey?
- All right.

501
00:29:09,587 --> 00:29:12,335
Looking good. Look like you
took off a couple of tons. Ha, ha, ha.

502
00:29:12,545 --> 00:29:15,502
- What brings you down here, Charlie?
- Ha, ha, ha.

503
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:19,461
Look, Joey, on Friday the 25th
I placed a bet with Sally.

504
00:29:19,627 --> 00:29:21,377
- Never heard of it.
- Never heard of it?

505
00:29:21,544 --> 00:29:24,251
Never heard of Sally.
Who the fuck is Sally?

506
00:29:24,419 --> 00:29:26,168
Oh, Joey, really.

507
00:29:26,335 --> 00:29:29,001
We're all friends here.
Let's cut the bullshit, huh?

508
00:29:33,085 --> 00:29:36,208
Well, uh... Hey, Jimmy,
you know you got a good friend here.

509
00:29:36,376 --> 00:29:37,459
Wonderful.

510
00:29:37,626 --> 00:29:41,833
- Come to think of it, I do remember now.
- That's a real scumbag.

511
00:29:42,001 --> 00:29:43,167
Shut up.

512
00:29:43,334 --> 00:29:47,124
Hey, Friday's a busy day.
A mistake can be made, you know?

513
00:29:47,292 --> 00:29:49,166
- Right, no problem.
- All right.

514
00:29:49,333 --> 00:29:51,166
I forget myself too sometimes.

515
00:29:51,333 --> 00:29:53,166
- Okay, let's have a drink.
- Good enough.

516
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:56,415
Come on, now let's have a drink.
Jimmy, Tony, finish the rack.

517
00:29:56,583 --> 00:29:58,248
- Who's buying?
- Me.

518
00:29:59,999 --> 00:30:04,206
Forever they will haunt me

519
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:07,414
- Hey. Hey. Hey.
- Ha, ha, ha.

520
00:30:09,832 --> 00:30:13,747
Those oldies but goodies

521
00:30:13,914 --> 00:30:15,997
Can I have a beer, Joey?

522
00:30:16,165 --> 00:30:17,997
Go ahead. I got scotch here.

523
00:30:18,165 --> 00:30:19,663
I got a dry throat.

524
00:30:19,831 --> 00:30:21,663
Hey, where'd you get the hat?

525
00:30:21,831 --> 00:30:25,829
You like this hat?
This is a $25 Dobbs hat.

526
00:30:25,997 --> 00:30:27,912
Where'd you get those sneakers?

527
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,912
- These are $2 sneakers.
- Ha, ha, ha.

528
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:34,203
Why don't you lower the jukebox?
I can't hear.

529
00:30:34,371 --> 00:30:36,911
Hey, the girls like the music loud.

530
00:30:37,329 --> 00:30:39,453
Girls? You call those skanks girls?

531
00:30:40,829 --> 00:30:43,703
Hey. - Hey, what's
the matter with this kid, huh?

532
00:30:43,871 --> 00:30:46,119
Ain't nothing wrong with me.
I'm feeling fine.

533
00:30:46,287 --> 00:30:49,035
- Keep your mouth shut.
- In front of this asshole?

534
00:30:49,203 --> 00:30:52,161
All right. We're not gonna pay,
we're not paying.

535
00:30:52,327 --> 00:30:54,660
- Joey.
- Why? We just said we'll have a drink.

536
00:30:54,828 --> 00:30:57,326
We're not paying because this guy...

537
00:30:57,785 --> 00:30:59,743
This guy's a fucking mook.

538
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:01,285
But I didn't say nothing.

539
00:31:01,452 --> 00:31:03,325
And we don't pay mooks.

540
00:31:04,326 --> 00:31:07,325
- A mook? I'm a mook?
- Yeah.

541
00:31:07,951 --> 00:31:10,117
- What's a mook?
- A mook? What's a mook?

542
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:12,408
- I don't know.
- What's a mook?

543
00:31:12,951 --> 00:31:15,199
- You can't call me a mook.
- I can't?

544
00:31:15,367 --> 00:31:16,700
No!

545
00:31:18,743 --> 00:31:20,949
- I'll give you mook!
- Hey.

546
00:31:24,491 --> 00:31:25,532
A fight.

547
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:27,157
<i>A letter for me</i>

548
00:31:27,408 --> 00:31:31,449
<i>I've been standing here waiting
Mr. Postman</i>

549
00:31:31,907 --> 00:31:35,031
Hey, hey, hey!
Come on, I got a bad hand!

550
00:31:35,199 --> 00:31:38,989
<i>For just a card
Or just a letter</i>

551
00:31:39,157 --> 00:31:42,072
<i>Saying he's returning home to me</i>

552
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,739
<i>Mr. Postman</i>

553
00:31:43,906 --> 00:31:45,780
<i>Mr. Postman, look and see</i>

554
00:31:45,948 --> 00:31:47,196
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

555
00:31:47,364 --> 00:31:49,613
<i>If there's a letter in your bag for me</i>

556
00:31:49,781 --> 00:31:51,530
Let's get him up against the wall.

557
00:31:54,072 --> 00:31:55,155
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

558
00:31:55,322 --> 00:31:58,029
<i>Since I heard from that boyfriend of mine</i>

559
00:31:58,822 --> 00:32:02,820
<i>So many days you passed me by</i>

560
00:32:03,238 --> 00:32:04,653
That's it. That's it.

561
00:32:06,654 --> 00:32:10,403
<i>You wouldn't stop to make me feel better</i>

562
00:32:10,696 --> 00:32:14,528
<i>By leaving me a card or a letter</i>

563
00:32:15,112 --> 00:32:17,819
- Come on, get him!
- Get him!

564
00:32:18,237 --> 00:32:19,485
I got him.

565
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:23,610
- Get him!
- Get him!

566
00:32:24,445 --> 00:32:26,360
- Watch out!
- He's got a pool cue!

567
00:32:26,777 --> 00:32:28,651
- Watch out!
- Watch out!

568
00:32:28,819 --> 00:32:29,943
Mushy!

569
00:32:30,111 --> 00:32:32,818
<i>You gotta wait a minute, wait a minute</i>

570
00:32:33,152 --> 00:32:35,484
<i>Oh, you gotta wait a minute</i>

571
00:32:35,694 --> 00:32:37,151
Come on, grab him!

572
00:32:38,818 --> 00:32:41,608
- Hey, watch out!
- Get him!

573
00:32:41,776 --> 00:32:45,150
<i>Can you check and see
Just one more time for me?</i>

574
00:32:49,984 --> 00:32:52,691
Damn it! Grab his arms!

575
00:32:57,774 --> 00:33:01,732
<i>Deliver the letter
The sooner the better</i>

576
00:33:01,899 --> 00:33:04,690
What's the matter with you, Joey?

577
00:33:04,858 --> 00:33:08,356
<i>Wait a minute
Please, Mr. Postman</i>

578
00:33:09,815 --> 00:33:11,856
What's going on here?

579
00:33:13,648 --> 00:33:15,064
The cops. The cops.

580
00:33:20,981 --> 00:33:23,021
- Hey, officer. Can I get my hat?
- No.

581
00:33:23,189 --> 00:33:25,188
- Can I call my wife?
- Nope.

582
00:33:32,646 --> 00:33:34,229
What you got here?

583
00:33:34,397 --> 00:33:35,687
That's a nail file.

584
00:33:35,855 --> 00:33:37,645
- That's a knife.
- No.

585
00:33:37,813 --> 00:33:40,145
- This is a knife.
- It's got a toothpick in there.

586
00:33:40,312 --> 00:33:43,602
Davis, Davis, this is very embarrassing.

587
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:46,186
Look, how long have I known you,
Davis, huh?

588
00:33:46,353 --> 00:33:49,310
You've never seen fights like this.
These are my friends.

589
00:33:49,478 --> 00:33:52,310
- This is my cousin Charlie. We're friends.
- Friends.

590
00:33:52,478 --> 00:33:54,643
- Your cousin? Where you from?
- East Side.

591
00:33:54,811 --> 00:33:56,643
The East Side. What is this, a knife?

592
00:33:56,811 --> 00:34:00,393
No! It's got a toothpick in there.
You see over there?

593
00:34:00,561 --> 00:34:02,560
Davis, come here. I wanna talk to you.

594
00:34:02,728 --> 00:34:04,934
You covering for the East Side
or the West Side?

595
00:34:05,102 --> 00:34:08,684
- Let me just talk to you over here.
- What are you gonna say about this knife?

596
00:34:08,852 --> 00:34:10,642
- It's a harmless penknife.
- Harmless?

597
00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:13,100
It's a dangerous weapon.
Do you know the penalty?

598
00:34:13,268 --> 00:34:16,308
- I'm sure we can settle this.
- How are we gonna settle this?

599
00:34:16,476 --> 00:34:19,142
- Let me give you some car fare.
- All right.

600
00:34:19,309 --> 00:34:21,766
Took you a long time. Where you going?

601
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:24,641
- New Jersey.
- New Jersey. All right, here.

602
00:34:24,809 --> 00:34:27,807
- This is for you and your partner...
- Going to Philadelphia.

603
00:34:29,267 --> 00:34:30,307
Here.

604
00:34:30,474 --> 00:34:32,141
- Thank you.
- Okay.

605
00:34:32,307 --> 00:34:33,640
Thanks a lot, Davis.

606
00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:36,682
- Here.
- Thanks.

607
00:34:36,849 --> 00:34:39,390
Johnny, come on.

608
00:34:41,473 --> 00:34:43,973
- Thanks a lot, Davis.
- And you guys here, listen.

609
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:48,139
No more of this fooling around, huh?
You guys'll get hurt like that. All right?

610
00:34:48,306 --> 00:34:49,805
Okay.

611
00:34:49,973 --> 00:34:51,638
So long, Davis.

612
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:56,346
Come on, let's have a drink.
Come on, let's have a drink, everybody.

613
00:34:56,514 --> 00:34:58,555
Who were those mooks that jumped us?

614
00:34:58,723 --> 00:35:01,304
Every day is Christmas with these cops.

615
00:35:03,222 --> 00:35:06,429
We were gonna pay you.
We just don't like being pushed around.

616
00:35:06,596 --> 00:35:10,095
- Come on, Joe, we're pushing you around?
- Yeah.

617
00:35:10,304 --> 00:35:13,928
- Let's have a drink and forget it.
- This is the drink we never had before.

618
00:35:14,096 --> 00:35:16,594
- Come on, salute.
- Salute.

619
00:35:20,387 --> 00:35:21,760
Ah.

620
00:35:22,678 --> 00:35:24,885
All right, there's your money.

621
00:35:27,344 --> 00:35:31,051
- You don't have to count it. It's all
there. - No, go ahead. Count it.

622
00:35:31,219 --> 00:35:34,260
Hey, come on, no bullshit. Friends.

623
00:35:34,428 --> 00:35:38,093
- Hey, don't fucking touch me, scumbag.
- Hey, hey, hey.

624
00:35:40,176 --> 00:35:41,801
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

625
00:35:43,135 --> 00:35:46,300
- Fuck youse all!
- Relax, huh?

626
00:35:48,801 --> 00:35:50,425
Come on! Come on!

627
00:35:50,592 --> 00:35:52,633
Hey, that's for you!

628
00:35:52,801 --> 00:35:54,591
Up your ass!

629
00:35:54,758 --> 00:35:58,133
Come back here again,
you'll find out what's gonna happen to you.

630
00:35:58,300 --> 00:35:59,841
Fucking douche bags!

631
00:36:00,134 --> 00:36:02,340
- "Mook." I don't know what that is.
- Johnny.

632
00:36:02,508 --> 00:36:05,632
- We're gonna look it up.
- Stop with the "mook."

633
00:36:05,841 --> 00:36:08,215
Look at that, look at that.

634
00:36:08,383 --> 00:36:10,339
- Don't touch it, it hurts.
- You look great.

635
00:36:10,507 --> 00:36:13,131
- Got something we can put on his eyes?
- I got something.

636
00:36:13,298 --> 00:36:16,005
- First, I wanna show you something.
- What does "mook" mean?

637
00:36:16,173 --> 00:36:17,922
Hey, Jimmy Mook.

638
00:36:21,548 --> 00:36:25,714
Okay, baby, just relax.
Take it easy. That's it.

639
00:36:27,631 --> 00:36:30,296
Uh-uh. Time out.
George, you're supposed to be working.

640
00:36:30,463 --> 00:36:32,587
Tony, give me a break. I'm with a girl.

641
00:36:32,755 --> 00:36:35,212
- Yeah, go out and work.
- Oh.

642
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:37,003
Charlie, give him a break.

643
00:36:37,171 --> 00:36:39,254
Close the door, George.

644
00:36:40,629 --> 00:36:42,837
- Before we take care of you.
- Smells like shit.

645
00:36:43,004 --> 00:36:46,003
There's something I gotta show you.
Watch this.

646
00:36:51,129 --> 00:36:52,211
Oh, hey!

647
00:36:52,379 --> 00:36:53,627
Where did you get this?

648
00:36:53,795 --> 00:36:55,293
Look at the size of these guys!

649
00:36:55,461 --> 00:36:57,836
- Tony, you gotta be kidding me.
- That's crazy.

650
00:36:58,002 --> 00:37:01,793
Look at this one. That's beautiful.
That panther. Where did you get this?

651
00:37:01,961 --> 00:37:03,918
How many pounds of meat
you feed him, huh?

652
00:37:04,086 --> 00:37:06,626
Keep quiet about this.
I don't have a license for him.

653
00:37:06,794 --> 00:37:09,418
- Where did you get him?
- Nobody can go near him but me.

654
00:37:09,585 --> 00:37:12,292
I'm the only one who can feed him.
Watch.

655
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:15,667
- You got claw insurance, or what?
- What are you doing?

656
00:37:15,835 --> 00:37:17,625
Hey! Hey!

657
00:37:18,501 --> 00:37:20,458
- You crazy or what?
- Be careful.

658
00:37:20,626 --> 00:37:22,874
What are you, out of your mind, Tony?

659
00:37:23,042 --> 00:37:26,083
What are you doing, cowards?
No wonder Italy lost the war.

660
00:37:26,251 --> 00:37:27,833
Here's Daddy. Here's Daddy.

661
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,416
Tony, be careful.

662
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:34,332
I really wanted to get a tiger, Charlie.
Old William Blake and all that.

663
00:37:43,624 --> 00:37:46,872
Okay. Come on. Come on.

664
00:37:47,873 --> 00:37:49,789
That's it. That's it.

665
00:37:50,456 --> 00:37:52,163
That's it. Hug Daddy. Hug Daddy.

666
00:37:52,331 --> 00:37:54,414
Come on. Come on.

667
00:37:57,081 --> 00:38:00,205
That's it, baby. Good girl. Good girl.

668
00:38:00,372 --> 00:38:02,621
Come on. That's it.

669
00:38:02,956 --> 00:38:05,787
That's it. Don't bite. Don't bite.

670
00:38:05,955 --> 00:38:09,912
That's it. Good. Good girl.

671
00:38:40,452 --> 00:38:42,659
You believe anything anybody says.

672
00:38:42,827 --> 00:38:45,992
That's right, I believe anybody.
That's my charm.

673
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:48,283
Some charm, pops.

674
00:38:50,951 --> 00:38:55,449
- What about the time you went on retreat?
- What about it? You... Hey.

675
00:38:55,951 --> 00:38:57,950
Charlie goes on this retreat.

676
00:38:58,117 --> 00:39:01,449
He tells me this story about a priest
who used to, uh...

677
00:39:01,866 --> 00:39:05,448
...let this couple
borrow his car for dates.

678
00:39:05,616 --> 00:39:07,990
They didn't make it,
because they weren't married.

679
00:39:08,157 --> 00:39:11,573
But two weeks before the marriage,
they decided to make it.

680
00:39:11,741 --> 00:39:15,031
So they pull over to the side of the road
in the priest's car.

681
00:39:16,407 --> 00:39:19,280
Boom. Mack truck comes along,
and they're both killed.

682
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:29,321
That's great. That's true?
This really happened? Madon.

683
00:39:29,489 --> 00:39:31,030
No, wait.

684
00:39:32,072 --> 00:39:34,279
Charlie believes it.

685
00:39:34,447 --> 00:39:37,238
I tell him two years before that...

686
00:39:37,406 --> 00:39:40,904
...I went on a retreat
and the priest tells me the same story.

687
00:39:41,072 --> 00:39:43,945
It's a different priest,
it's the exact same story.

688
00:39:44,113 --> 00:39:45,445
- So that...
- You get it?

689
00:39:45,613 --> 00:39:48,445
Yeah, you mean the story
ain't true, right?

690
00:39:50,779 --> 00:39:55,111
Yeah, but the point is, he's really upset.

691
00:39:55,278 --> 00:39:57,277
What he don't understand is...

692
00:39:57,445 --> 00:40:01,277
...it's a business, it's work,
it's an organization.

693
00:40:01,444 --> 00:40:04,193
You got a way about talking
about one thing and then, zap...

694
00:40:04,361 --> 00:40:08,110
...you slide right into something else
like nobody's even supposed to notice.

695
00:40:08,277 --> 00:40:10,068
I was mad because they lied to me.

696
00:40:10,277 --> 00:40:13,234
I'm gonna tell you one thing:
I ain't never going on no retreat.

697
00:40:13,402 --> 00:40:14,442
Never.

698
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:16,942
Why do you let those guys get to you?

699
00:40:17,943 --> 00:40:20,109
Because they're supposed to be guys.

700
00:40:20,276 --> 00:40:23,400
Hey, listen, that's where you and I differ.
What can I tell you?

701
00:40:24,484 --> 00:40:26,608
You want me to say it?

702
00:40:26,776 --> 00:40:28,941
You gotta be like me.

703
00:40:31,983 --> 00:40:33,440
You wanna be saved.

704
00:40:45,315 --> 00:40:46,815
Bar's closed, kid.

705
00:40:47,565 --> 00:40:49,147
I'm just waiting for Joey.

706
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,106
All right, sit down.

707
00:41:17,938 --> 00:41:19,937
I gotta go to the bathroom.

708
00:41:20,521 --> 00:41:23,353
So go ahead. What do you want,
somebody to hold it for you?

709
00:41:23,521 --> 00:41:25,311
- Jesus.
- What a jerk-off.

710
00:41:28,229 --> 00:41:29,811
Charlie, hold it for him.

711
00:41:29,978 --> 00:41:31,811
Hold his ding-dong.

712
00:41:32,687 --> 00:41:34,268
George.

713
00:41:36,061 --> 00:41:37,310
You wanna do something?

714
00:41:37,478 --> 00:41:39,476
Yeah. You know how he gets.

715
00:41:39,644 --> 00:41:41,893
You know how my chairs get?

716
00:41:46,268 --> 00:41:48,017
Hey, hey.

717
00:41:48,185 --> 00:41:49,684
What is it with this guy?

718
00:41:49,851 --> 00:41:53,350
- This place is really getting depressing.
- That's an understatement.

719
00:41:53,518 --> 00:41:55,058
If I had my place, every night...

720
00:41:55,226 --> 00:41:57,974
...get bums like this down,
have things happening.

721
00:41:58,142 --> 00:42:00,474
Call it something like
Season of the Witch. Get it?

722
00:42:00,642 --> 00:42:01,683
- Got it.
- Good.

723
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:03,391
Bullshit.

724
00:42:03,558 --> 00:42:07,766
Who's talking bullshit? Who's the guy
with William Blake and the tigers?

725
00:42:08,266 --> 00:42:12,473
Hey, come on. Will you guys shut up
with the tigers and the witches over here?

726
00:42:12,641 --> 00:42:14,973
Let's get out of here.
Come on, close the place.

727
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:17,640
I'll get out of here
when the place is ready to close.

728
00:42:17,808 --> 00:42:20,556
Close it now.
We get out of here, get something to eat.

729
00:42:20,723 --> 00:42:23,014
When everybody leaves, we close.

730
00:42:23,182 --> 00:42:25,972
Don't forget what's-his-name
in the bathroom.

731
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:31,305
Charlie, come here.
Let me show you a picture of yourself.

732
00:42:32,139 --> 00:42:35,429
Hm. Not quite, but keep trying.

733
00:42:35,597 --> 00:42:36,930
Dummkopf.

734
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:41,638
- You wanna have a game after we close?
- No.

735
00:42:41,805 --> 00:42:43,929
Yeah, come on. For how much?

736
00:42:44,097 --> 00:42:45,387
Scumbag.

737
00:42:45,554 --> 00:42:48,096
- Don't call me no scumbag.
- You can't pay what you owe.

738
00:42:48,262 --> 00:42:51,053
As soon as a game shows up,
you, bang, wanna jump in.

739
00:42:51,221 --> 00:42:52,928
"For how much?"

740
00:42:53,096 --> 00:42:55,136
Why don't you use your head?

741
00:42:55,887 --> 00:43:00,302
Hey, hold! What's the matter
with you guys? We're friends!

742
00:43:03,261 --> 00:43:04,927
What the fuck is wrong with you?

743
00:43:05,095 --> 00:43:07,968
- Me? He's calling me a scumbag.
- You too.

744
00:43:08,136 --> 00:43:10,968
- All right, enough.
- Fucking moron.

745
00:43:13,052 --> 00:43:15,801
- Moron?
- Yeah, moron.

746
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:19,218
Go ahead. Hit each other
with the fucking chairs, why don't you?

747
00:43:22,093 --> 00:43:24,425
- Come on, we gonna go eat now?
- All right, enough.

748
00:43:24,593 --> 00:43:27,716
- You ought to know better than that.
- I'm sorry.

749
00:43:28,385 --> 00:43:29,925
Sorry.

750
00:43:30,342 --> 00:43:33,091
I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry.

751
00:43:34,842 --> 00:43:37,882
- Wanna play a little cards?
- No.

752
00:43:43,716 --> 00:43:45,923
Anybody wanna have a game?

753
00:43:49,049 --> 00:43:52,756
Michael, I've got a game
you cannot say no to.

754
00:43:52,924 --> 00:43:54,339
No.

755
00:43:54,507 --> 00:43:55,839
You said no.

756
00:43:56,882 --> 00:43:58,214
Lot of sports.

757
00:44:03,173 --> 00:44:05,089
A little blackjack?

758
00:44:05,881 --> 00:44:06,963
Eh.

759
00:45:09,375 --> 00:45:10,666
Somebody get the gun!

760
00:45:19,041 --> 00:45:20,331
Everybody out!

761
00:45:20,499 --> 00:45:21,915
George, kill the lights!

762
00:45:35,081 --> 00:45:37,163
Don't run! Split up! Split up!

763
00:45:37,331 --> 00:45:39,038
Don't run!

764
00:45:41,830 --> 00:45:44,204
Don't run, just split up. Don't run.

765
00:45:45,955 --> 00:45:48,621
Don't run! Just split up!

766
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:50,828
Hey! Don't run!

767
00:45:52,246 --> 00:45:55,244
George, where are you going?
Where's your car?

768
00:45:57,245 --> 00:45:58,578
Mikey.

769
00:46:00,287 --> 00:46:02,078
Michael, let us go with you.

770
00:46:02,245 --> 00:46:04,036
Hey, chauffeur!

771
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:06,911
- Hey, chauffeur...
- Shut up. Quit your hollering.

772
00:46:07,078 --> 00:46:09,744
- It's too pack. I'll ask him.
- Uptown, Jeeves.

773
00:46:09,911 --> 00:46:11,910
Come on. Hurry up.
Where are we gonna go?

774
00:46:12,078 --> 00:46:13,202
Michael, give us a lift.

775
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:16,118
Get out of here. Get the fuck out of here!

776
00:46:16,285 --> 00:46:18,660
- Hey, get out of here!
- Get out of here!

777
00:46:18,827 --> 00:46:20,159
Hey!

778
00:46:20,327 --> 00:46:21,992
You're making too much noise.

779
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24,368
Just get in.
I'm standing out here in the rain.

780
00:46:24,534 --> 00:46:25,992
What's the matter with you guys?

781
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:29,034
Hey, stay there. Come on,
get away. Get... Hey, move over.

782
00:46:29,201 --> 00:46:32,158
Stay over there. Stay on your side.
Don't touch me.

783
00:46:32,326 --> 00:46:35,033
Where are we? Where are we?

784
00:46:35,201 --> 00:46:38,033
Sammy, get control of yourself.
Will you behave yourself.

785
00:46:38,201 --> 00:46:40,741
I'm terribly sorry.
It's just that he's frightened.

786
00:46:40,909 --> 00:46:43,532
Just keep him quiet, all right?

787
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:46,740
- Are these friends of yours, Mike?
- What are you, a comedian?

788
00:46:47,741 --> 00:46:49,865
I can't get over the way
he kept going at him.

789
00:46:50,033 --> 00:46:52,657
Yeah, must've been
all that liquor in him, boy.

790
00:46:54,865 --> 00:46:57,656
Yeah, chetarsi.
You know what chetarsi means, Sammy?

791
00:46:57,823 --> 00:46:59,781
Sounds like something dirty. Heh, heh.

792
00:47:00,074 --> 00:47:01,906
What are you looking at?

793
00:47:02,073 --> 00:47:04,489
What are we doing with
these faggots? Throw them out.

794
00:47:04,657 --> 00:47:08,738
You nuts? What do you want me
to do, leave them in front of Tony's place?

795
00:47:09,114 --> 00:47:11,404
Hey, Benton, look at that number. Wow.

796
00:47:11,572 --> 00:47:13,655
- Hey, shut up!
- Hey, beautiful!

797
00:47:13,822 --> 00:47:15,196
Hey, hey, hey! Keep him down!

798
00:47:15,364 --> 00:47:17,237
- Keep quiet.
- What's the matter?

799
00:47:18,863 --> 00:47:21,320
Look at this. We're embarrassing.

800
00:47:21,488 --> 00:47:22,820
Sammy, behave yourself.

801
00:47:22,988 --> 00:47:26,362
I won't. I won't. Why should I?

802
00:47:26,529 --> 00:47:29,403
- Let me out of this car!
- Sammy, stop it! Come here!

803
00:47:29,737 --> 00:47:30,986
Look at that one!

804
00:47:31,154 --> 00:47:32,402
Oh, my God!

805
00:47:32,570 --> 00:47:34,694
Hey, baby, got any meat?

806
00:47:34,987 --> 00:47:39,693
Hey, baby, I want to suck on that! Baby!
I want to suck on that!

807
00:47:41,362 --> 00:47:42,902
I want it all!

808
00:47:45,111 --> 00:47:47,568
Get them out of here! All right, that's it.

809
00:47:47,943 --> 00:47:50,568
Get out of here! Get them out of here!

810
00:47:50,735 --> 00:47:52,193
Don't push!

811
00:47:52,568 --> 00:47:55,567
- What do you mean, get out?
- Get out of here!

812
00:47:55,735 --> 00:47:57,359
I just got in.

813
00:47:57,526 --> 00:47:59,067
Go, go!

814
00:47:59,234 --> 00:48:00,692
- Animals!
- Take it easy.

815
00:48:00,859 --> 00:48:03,317
All right, just a minute, please.

816
00:48:05,567 --> 00:48:07,566
- Thanks for the ride, Mike.
- See you around.

817
00:48:07,734 --> 00:48:10,107
Wait a minute. What is this?

818
00:48:10,275 --> 00:48:12,274
Hey, fellas, you going my way?

819
00:48:12,442 --> 00:48:14,732
Come on.
What you bothering with them for?

820
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:16,565
What's your problem?

821
00:48:16,733 --> 00:48:18,190
Bullshit.

822
00:48:21,775 --> 00:48:24,231
Hey, look at that piece, Johnny.

823
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:27,481
It's one of those little jobs
cops carry in their sock.

824
00:48:27,649 --> 00:48:29,898
Yeah, cop hit me on the head
with one of those.

825
00:48:30,065 --> 00:48:32,731
Remember that time I got that beating
from those cops?

826
00:48:32,898 --> 00:48:35,314
Yeah, you never recovered from that one,
did you?

827
00:48:35,482 --> 00:48:37,397
I never recovered?

828
00:48:37,564 --> 00:48:40,064
If I wasn't there to be used
as a punching bag...

829
00:48:40,230 --> 00:48:42,146
...to enable you to leave fast...

830
00:48:42,314 --> 00:48:46,396
That's because you're stupid.
You should've ran and left safely with me.

831
00:48:46,564 --> 00:48:49,104
With you?
I'm stupid for getting my head punched in?

832
00:48:49,272 --> 00:48:50,896
You schweinehund!

833
00:48:54,188 --> 00:48:56,395
My bad hand, my bad hand.

834
00:48:56,563 --> 00:48:58,936
- Wait a minute.
- What are you doing?

835
00:48:59,104 --> 00:49:00,686
Shh. Joe Black.

836
00:49:00,854 --> 00:49:03,353
Joe Black. I owe him money.

837
00:49:06,145 --> 00:49:08,769
- I don't think that's him.
- Yeah, it's him.

838
00:49:09,062 --> 00:49:10,477
Where is he?

839
00:49:10,645 --> 00:49:11,852
He turned the corner.

840
00:49:12,603 --> 00:49:14,894
- Is he gone?
- Yeah, he turned the corner.

841
00:49:15,061 --> 00:49:16,644
That don't mean he's gone.

842
00:49:16,811 --> 00:49:19,768
Get over here. He turned the corner.
What's the matter with you?

843
00:49:19,935 --> 00:49:22,476
Come here. I'm talking to to.

844
00:49:36,351 --> 00:49:38,224
Watch out for that.

845
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:43,016
You can't go home like that.
Stay with me.

846
00:49:43,184 --> 00:49:44,432
Your mother ain't there?

847
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:46,891
She's on the island
taking care of my grandmother.

848
00:49:47,059 --> 00:49:49,557
Hey, let's get some bread
from my uncle's store.

849
00:49:51,266 --> 00:49:53,973
- I'm sick about my hat.
- Here.

850
00:49:56,932 --> 00:49:59,139
Your grandma's gonna die, right?

851
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:01,473
Yeah, right.

852
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:04,014
Did you like her?

853
00:50:04,182 --> 00:50:06,347
What do you mean?
She's my grandmother.

854
00:50:06,514 --> 00:50:08,097
So what? That don't mean nothing.

855
00:50:08,264 --> 00:50:09,388
"So what?"

856
00:50:09,556 --> 00:50:12,472
- What's the matter with you?
- What's the matter with you?

857
00:50:12,764 --> 00:50:16,679
Jesus. Anyway, she ain't dead yet,
God forbid. So shut up.

858
00:50:18,388 --> 00:50:20,429
- Charlie!
- What?

859
00:50:20,597 --> 00:50:22,970
You ain't got nothing to eat over here.

860
00:50:23,138 --> 00:50:24,720
I could've told you that before.

861
00:50:24,888 --> 00:50:27,887
Got nothing.
I tell you what, you know what we do?

862
00:50:28,055 --> 00:50:30,553
- What do you want?
- Tell you what we do.

863
00:50:31,429 --> 00:50:33,219
I'll go to my aunt's. She's got food.

864
00:50:33,387 --> 00:50:36,303
She keeps food all the time.
I'll go through the fire escape.

865
00:50:36,471 --> 00:50:40,844
Don't do that. You'll scare your cousin
Teresa, you go in there that way.

866
00:50:41,137 --> 00:50:44,469
Oh, that's right, yeah.
Hey, you know what we can do?

867
00:50:44,637 --> 00:50:46,760
She can have a seizure.
Then we can watch.

868
00:50:46,927 --> 00:50:50,843
That's not funny.
You gonna be a jerk-off all your life?

869
00:50:51,302 --> 00:50:53,259
Grow up, huh?

870
00:50:53,427 --> 00:50:56,551
You want some food from your aunt,
go and knock on her door.

871
00:50:56,719 --> 00:50:59,508
Forget it. I ain't hungry now.
Go to sleep.

872
00:50:59,676 --> 00:51:02,383
Besides, where are you going
at 6:00 in the morning?

873
00:51:03,426 --> 00:51:05,050
I don't know.

874
00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:44,005
- Did you say your prayers?
- Ha, ha.

875
00:51:44,173 --> 00:51:47,713
Very funny.
Hey, why don't you tuck me in, sweetie?

876
00:52:01,630 --> 00:52:04,462
Teresa, I had a dream last night
about you and me.

877
00:52:04,629 --> 00:52:08,544
I gotta tell you this.
We're in this room and we're both naked.

878
00:52:08,712 --> 00:52:12,960
And there's this huge white bed and you're
lying on it and I'm standing over you.

879
00:52:13,337 --> 00:52:16,461
And we're just about to make love
and I come.

880
00:52:17,502 --> 00:52:19,835
The only thing is, I come blood.

881
00:52:20,544 --> 00:52:23,752
Heh, heh, heh.
And blood went all over the place.

882
00:52:23,918 --> 00:52:28,043
Squirting all over the place, all over you,
all over me, my hands and everything.

883
00:52:28,210 --> 00:52:29,667
I don't think that's funny.

884
00:52:30,835 --> 00:52:33,083
Girls bother me.
They got no sense of humor.

885
00:52:33,251 --> 00:52:34,292
Well, I'm a girl.

886
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:36,375
Do you like me?

887
00:52:37,043 --> 00:52:38,583
Yeah, I like you.

888
00:52:38,751 --> 00:52:40,750
I love you.

889
00:52:41,876 --> 00:52:43,541
Well, I don't love you.

890
00:52:43,709 --> 00:52:45,374
We'll see.

891
00:52:45,542 --> 00:52:47,957
Hey, forget it.

892
00:52:48,125 --> 00:52:51,707
If there was a chance of me falling in love
with you, I wouldn't be here.

893
00:52:51,875 --> 00:52:53,624
Because?

894
00:52:53,791 --> 00:52:55,624
Because with you, I can't get involved.

895
00:52:55,791 --> 00:52:58,582
- Because?
- Because you're a cunt.

896
00:52:58,874 --> 00:53:01,497
- It was a joke.
- Where do you get off talking like that?

897
00:53:01,665 --> 00:53:04,040
It was only a joke, for chrissake.
Hey, come here.

898
00:53:04,206 --> 00:53:05,456
Like hell it was.

899
00:53:06,582 --> 00:53:09,289
What are you standing
in front of the window like that for?

900
00:53:09,457 --> 00:53:13,122
Someone might see you.
Get over here. Come on.

901
00:53:14,123 --> 00:53:16,330
Go ahead. Jump out the fucking window.

902
00:53:18,539 --> 00:53:19,663
Don't look.

903
00:53:22,456 --> 00:53:23,954
Don't look.

904
00:53:24,705 --> 00:53:28,537
- You really don't want me to look?
- Yeah, I really don't want you to look.

905
00:53:47,870 --> 00:53:49,869
- Heh, heh, heh.
- I see what you're doing.

906
00:53:52,161 --> 00:53:54,701
- I saw you.
- What? I wasn't doing nothing.

907
00:53:54,869 --> 00:53:56,576
What do you want?

908
00:54:01,702 --> 00:54:02,701
Ugh.

909
00:54:02,868 --> 00:54:04,159
Ah!

910
00:54:05,577 --> 00:54:07,617
You wild woman.

911
00:54:08,201 --> 00:54:09,491
Leave me alone!

912
00:54:09,659 --> 00:54:12,867
- Get your hands off me!
- Let go of me.

913
00:54:16,117 --> 00:54:18,532
- You're killing me.
- Ha, ha, ha.

914
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:22,115
You should've seen it. Unbelievable.

915
00:54:24,450 --> 00:54:26,490
Kid went right to the bathroom
and shot him.

916
00:54:26,658 --> 00:54:28,615
Guy kept coming at him like Rasputin.

917
00:54:28,782 --> 00:54:30,448
Madon. That kid was scared.

918
00:54:30,657 --> 00:54:31,990
We were more scared.

919
00:54:32,158 --> 00:54:35,740
It doesn't make any sense. He shot
him just because he insulted Mario?

920
00:54:35,990 --> 00:54:38,614
It wasn't anything personal?

921
00:54:39,032 --> 00:54:41,156
The kid's a climber, not very bright.

922
00:54:41,324 --> 00:54:44,989
He kills a guy who insulted a big man,
gets a reputation, thinks he's made.

923
00:54:45,156 --> 00:54:46,196
It's still sick.

924
00:54:46,364 --> 00:54:48,614
Not sick, just stupid.

925
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:51,155
Which reminds me,
last night Johnny decided...

926
00:54:51,323 --> 00:54:54,155
...to break into your mother's house
and get some food.

927
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:59,529
- So why didn't you let him?
- Oh, that's funny.

928
00:55:00,488 --> 00:55:03,154
- Put that shit down. What are you doing?
- Ha, ha, ha.

929
00:55:03,322 --> 00:55:04,820
What's the matter with you?

930
00:55:04,988 --> 00:55:07,361
Hey, he doesn't know anything about us,
does he?

931
00:55:07,529 --> 00:55:10,861
- Really?
- No. I don't want him to know.

932
00:55:11,154 --> 00:55:13,320
Nobody knows anything.
Your reputation's safe.

933
00:55:13,486 --> 00:55:16,028
Hey, come on, smile. What's the matter?

934
00:55:16,194 --> 00:55:20,652
You look like you wanna kill me.
Wanna kill me? Go ahead, kill me.

935
00:55:20,819 --> 00:55:22,235
Ooh.

936
00:55:26,069 --> 00:55:28,735
Miss, you can make up the room now.

937
00:55:28,902 --> 00:55:31,109
- I only got two hands.
- Well, use them.

938
00:55:31,277 --> 00:55:33,484
- Cut that out, will you?
- I hate shit like that.

939
00:55:33,651 --> 00:55:35,234
Excuse me, ma'am.

940
00:55:36,484 --> 00:55:38,942
- You got some mouth, you know that?
- Kiss me.

941
00:55:39,109 --> 00:55:40,941
I'll give you a zap. Wow!

942
00:56:06,149 --> 00:56:08,148
- Hey, Hash, how you feeling?
- Pretty good.

943
00:56:08,316 --> 00:56:11,647
- My uncle in the back?
- Yeah, I think he's busy right now.

944
00:56:11,815 --> 00:56:15,855
Hey, Charlie,
play a 4-6-3 combination today.

945
00:56:16,023 --> 00:56:17,855
Yeah, thanks.

946
00:56:46,186 --> 00:56:47,644
What are you talking about?

947
00:56:49,103 --> 00:56:51,352
There was no insult. I know the kid.
He was drunk.

948
00:56:51,519 --> 00:56:53,518
He made a fool of himself, not me.

949
00:56:53,686 --> 00:56:55,518
Nobody had to shoot him.

950
00:57:44,889 --> 00:57:47,014
I hate the sun. Let's go inside, will you?

951
00:57:47,181 --> 00:57:48,471
What else do you hate?

952
00:57:48,681 --> 00:57:53,305
I hate the ocean, and I hate the beach,
and I hate the sun.

953
00:57:53,472 --> 00:57:57,679
And the grass and the trees
and I hate heat.

954
00:57:57,847 --> 00:57:59,762
- Charlie?
- What?

955
00:57:59,930 --> 00:58:01,138
What do you like?

956
00:58:01,305 --> 00:58:05,387
I like spaghetti and clam sauce.
Mountains.

957
00:58:05,555 --> 00:58:07,429
- Bzzz.
- Ha, ha, ha.

958
00:58:07,762 --> 00:58:10,053
Francis of Assisi.

959
00:58:10,221 --> 00:58:12,636
Chicken with lemon and garlic.

960
00:58:13,762 --> 00:58:14,969
And John Wayne.

961
00:58:15,137 --> 00:58:17,428
You know, there aren't any mountains
in Manhattan.

962
00:58:17,596 --> 00:58:21,011
Tall buildings. Same thing.
And I like you.

963
00:58:32,510 --> 00:58:34,759
I like it here alone.

964
00:58:37,468 --> 00:58:41,217
You know, I'm really gonna
take that apartment, the one uptown.

965
00:58:41,385 --> 00:58:43,717
- Are you?
- Yeah, I'm really gonna do it.

966
00:58:43,884 --> 00:58:45,842
- Why don't you do it this time?
- I'm gonna.

967
00:58:46,010 --> 00:58:49,300
The hell with my parents.
I just can't take it anymore.

968
00:58:49,467 --> 00:58:52,799
- I think it'd be a good move.
- I'm gonna do it.

969
00:58:52,967 --> 00:58:54,632
So, what are you waiting for?

970
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:56,340
For you.

971
00:58:56,508 --> 00:58:59,757
Teresa. Now, you can't wait for me now.

972
00:58:59,924 --> 00:59:02,798
I'm closing in on something
in the neighborhood. I gotta stay.

973
00:59:02,966 --> 00:59:04,257
What are you afraid of?

974
00:59:04,425 --> 00:59:08,506
Afraid? What are you talking about, afraid?
Go on. What's stopping you?

975
00:59:08,674 --> 00:59:11,839
You say you're not afraid of your parents,
so go ahead, move out.

976
00:59:12,465 --> 00:59:15,505
- All I've got is the neighborhood.
- What about me?

977
00:59:15,673 --> 00:59:19,006
The neighborhood and those guys.
That's all that's important to me now.

978
00:59:19,172 --> 00:59:21,130
Right, guys like my cousin Johnny.

979
00:59:21,298 --> 00:59:23,130
No, not exactly your cousin Johnny.

980
00:59:23,298 --> 00:59:25,588
Well, I hope not, because he is crazy.

981
00:59:25,755 --> 00:59:28,754
He is driving me nuts.
How can you be with him all the time?

982
00:59:28,922 --> 00:59:31,337
- He's like an insane person.
- What's wrong with you?

983
00:59:31,505 --> 00:59:34,671
- How can you talk that way about him?
- Oh, fuck him.

984
00:59:34,838 --> 00:59:36,462
That's terrible.

985
00:59:37,838 --> 00:59:39,878
Who's gonna help him if I don't?

986
00:59:40,046 --> 00:59:42,211
It's supposed to matter.
Nobody tries anymore.

987
00:59:42,379 --> 00:59:43,420
Tries what?

988
00:59:43,588 --> 00:59:47,253
Just tries to help, that's all.
Help people.

989
00:59:47,421 --> 00:59:48,627
You help yourself first.

990
00:59:48,795 --> 00:59:51,044
Bullshit, Teresa.
That's where you're all wrong.

991
00:59:51,211 --> 00:59:53,168
Francis of Assisi had it all down.

992
00:59:53,336 --> 00:59:55,502
- He knew.
- Ha, ha. What are you talking about?

993
00:59:55,670 --> 00:59:58,502
- He knew.
- What are you talking about?

994
00:59:58,669 --> 01:00:01,459
Saint Francis didn't run numbers.

995
01:00:02,669 --> 01:00:05,084
Me neither. I don't run numbers.

996
01:00:10,168 --> 01:00:13,417
My darling, I'm lonely

997
01:00:15,418 --> 01:00:18,417
Now that you're gone

998
01:00:18,585 --> 01:00:23,416
Please come back to me

999
01:00:25,917 --> 01:00:27,499
Diane, how are you feeling?

1000
01:00:27,667 --> 01:00:29,790
Fine. Excuse me, please.

1001
01:00:29,958 --> 01:00:34,373
You know, Diane, I've been wanting
to talk to you for a while now.

1002
01:00:34,541 --> 01:00:36,498
Excuse me.

1003
01:00:38,249 --> 01:00:40,706
Aside from all that joking around
that you and I do.

1004
01:00:40,873 --> 01:00:43,581
- You know, when you're on, I...
- Excuse me.

1005
01:00:43,748 --> 01:00:47,247
I really think you're a terrific performer.

1006
01:00:47,415 --> 01:00:48,455
Fine.

1007
01:00:48,623 --> 01:00:51,247
Hey, no, I'm serious.
You're really very good.

1008
01:00:51,415 --> 01:00:53,330
I know.

1009
01:00:53,498 --> 01:00:54,997
Groovy.

1010
01:00:55,581 --> 01:00:59,079
In a little while I'm gonna have
the opportunity of opening my own place.

1011
01:00:59,247 --> 01:01:00,996
Much nicer.

1012
01:01:01,205 --> 01:01:03,371
Much nicer than this.

1013
01:01:03,539 --> 01:01:08,870
Uptown, sort of a nightclub restaurant
and everything and, uh...

1014
01:01:09,871 --> 01:01:13,786
Uh, I was thinking you'd do much...
You'd do very nicely for the place.

1015
01:01:13,954 --> 01:01:15,536
Dancing?

1016
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:19,286
No, as the hostess. That's nice.

1017
01:01:19,453 --> 01:01:20,494
Hostess?

1018
01:01:20,662 --> 01:01:24,994
The people come in, you greet them
and you show them to the tables.

1019
01:01:25,161 --> 01:01:29,244
Listen, why don't we get together later on?
We'll talk about it a little bit.

1020
01:01:30,828 --> 01:01:34,702
- Chinese food?
- Hey, Chinese food.

1021
01:01:37,535 --> 01:01:39,701
Where do you want me to drop you off?

1022
01:01:39,868 --> 01:01:43,325
No, don't stop.
Just pass by real slow, okay?

1023
01:01:48,909 --> 01:01:50,242
Hey, stop here.

1024
01:01:50,409 --> 01:01:52,908
Hey. What, am I crazy?

1025
01:01:53,617 --> 01:01:56,116
Would you take me back
to where you picked me up?

1026
01:01:56,284 --> 01:01:58,782
- Sorry.
- All right.

1027
01:02:10,199 --> 01:02:12,156
Hey, am I crazy?

1028
01:02:12,365 --> 01:02:16,155
That's all I need now, to get caught
in the Village with a mulignan.

1029
01:02:20,781 --> 01:02:22,155
Hi, Lou.

1030
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:26,822
Fine, thank you. Good to see you.

1031
01:02:26,990 --> 01:02:29,071
- Good to see you.
- How's it going, Lou?

1032
01:02:29,239 --> 01:02:31,737
- Hi, Oscar.
- Giovanni.

1033
01:02:34,530 --> 01:02:36,779
Mario. Mario.

1034
01:03:00,444 --> 01:03:03,110
- Mario, how you doing? Nice to see you.
- How are you, kid?

1035
01:03:07,069 --> 01:03:09,818
- Giovanni, can I sit?
- Sure.

1036
01:03:15,901 --> 01:03:17,442
Can I talk?

1037
01:03:17,609 --> 01:03:20,358
- What is it?
- It's about Groppi.

1038
01:03:20,526 --> 01:03:23,400
I know all about it.
We'll discuss it later, huh?

1039
01:03:23,568 --> 01:03:27,108
Sure, I understand.
Shall I serve the tripe now?

1040
01:03:27,276 --> 01:03:30,399
- Anytime. Thank you, Oscar.
- You're welcome.

1041
01:03:45,148 --> 01:03:46,897
They are not like us.

1042
01:03:47,065 --> 01:03:49,481
They know where to come
when they need us.

1043
01:03:49,648 --> 01:03:52,564
I realized this a long time ago,
during World War ll.

1044
01:03:52,731 --> 01:03:56,896
Charlie Lakey was working for
the government, taking care of the docks.

1045
01:03:57,064 --> 01:03:59,146
- What did he do?
- What did he do?

1046
01:03:59,314 --> 01:04:00,896
He was there, that's what he did.

1047
01:04:03,064 --> 01:04:05,729
I said the same thing to your father
20 years ago.

1048
01:04:07,021 --> 01:04:08,312
He didn't listen.

1049
01:04:13,437 --> 01:04:15,979
You're still around that kid Johnny Boy.

1050
01:04:17,229 --> 01:04:19,478
This Johnny Boy is named after me.

1051
01:04:19,646 --> 01:04:21,852
Nice, huh? Oh, sure.

1052
01:04:22,020 --> 01:04:26,727
But this Johnny Boy is a little bit
like your friend Groppi, half-crazy.

1053
01:04:27,186 --> 01:04:30,810
I understand you try to help him out
because of our family and his family.

1054
01:04:30,978 --> 01:04:32,893
Well, that's nice. I understand.

1055
01:04:33,270 --> 01:04:35,977
But watch yourself, don't spoil anything.

1056
01:04:36,144 --> 01:04:38,685
Honorable men go with honorable men.

1057
01:04:41,060 --> 01:04:43,184
Don't forget that.

1058
01:04:44,227 --> 01:04:46,059
His whole family has problems.

1059
01:04:46,227 --> 01:04:49,850
His cousin, the girl who lives
next door to you...

1060
01:04:50,018 --> 01:04:52,975
- Teresa.
- The one who's sick in the head.

1061
01:04:53,142 --> 01:04:55,433
No, she's got epilepsy.

1062
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:58,141
That's what I said.
She's sick in the head.

1063
01:04:58,559 --> 01:05:01,016
Her mother and father came to me
for advice.

1064
01:05:01,183 --> 01:05:05,266
She wants her own apartment.
What am I gonna tell them? Lock her up?

1065
01:05:05,559 --> 01:05:07,682
You know I'm compato with them.

1066
01:05:07,849 --> 01:05:09,557
So I listen.

1067
01:05:09,724 --> 01:05:11,515
I have to take an interest.

1068
01:05:12,391 --> 01:05:16,390
You live next door. Keep an eye open.
But don't get involved.

1069
01:05:16,558 --> 01:05:20,556
Charlie, why don't you take a look
around the place if you want.

1070
01:05:20,723 --> 01:05:23,597
I've been in and out of this place
about 50 times already.

1071
01:05:23,765 --> 01:05:25,888
Well, maybe you missed something.

1072
01:05:26,056 --> 01:05:27,972
You should get to know the place.

1073
01:05:28,139 --> 01:05:29,972
All right. Yeah.

1074
01:05:42,346 --> 01:05:44,804
Jesus Christ, you are disgusting.

1075
01:05:49,555 --> 01:05:51,636
Hi, Charlie, how are you?
Hot enough for you?

1076
01:05:51,804 --> 01:05:53,803
Yeah, how are you doing there, Cookie?

1077
01:06:13,219 --> 01:06:14,260
Fine.

1078
01:06:14,701 --> 01:06:16,499
<i>is it in his eyes?</i>

1079
01:06:16,567 --> 01:06:18,799
<i>Oh, no, you'll be deceived </i>

1080
01:06:18,867 --> 01:06:20,499
<i>is it in his eyes?</i>

1081
01:06:20,567 --> 01:06:22,466
<i>Oh, no, he'll make believe </i>

1082
01:06:22,534 --> 01:06:24,333
<i>if you want to know</i>

1083
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:26,133
<i>if he loves you so</i>

1084
01:06:26,201 --> 01:06:27,600
<i>it's in his kiss...</i>

1085
01:06:27,634 --> 01:06:29,216
Teresa.

1086
01:06:29,551 --> 01:06:30,716
Psst!

1087
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:33,299
Downstairs.

1088
01:06:34,092 --> 01:06:37,465
Meet me downstairs now. Yeah.

1089
01:06:37,799 --> 01:06:39,465
<i>if you want to know</i>

1090
01:06:39,533 --> 01:06:41,698
<i>if he loves you so...</i>

1091
01:06:42,007 --> 01:06:44,590
- What is it?
- Come down.

1092
01:06:47,423 --> 01:06:48,839
Come out here.

1093
01:06:55,090 --> 01:06:56,630
Shit.

1094
01:06:58,257 --> 01:06:59,380
Uh...

1095
01:06:59,673 --> 01:07:01,755
I can't make it tonight.

1096
01:07:02,297 --> 01:07:03,630
Okay.

1097
01:07:04,589 --> 01:07:07,712
All right, so is that all?
So I'll see you on Friday?

1098
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:09,296
Friday, um...

1099
01:07:09,755 --> 01:07:12,504
I can't make it Friday either.

1100
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:15,587
What do you mean?

1101
01:07:16,463 --> 01:07:18,379
I can't see you for a while.

1102
01:07:19,255 --> 01:07:20,670
Don't tell me that.

1103
01:07:20,837 --> 01:07:22,628
- Teresa.
- Why?

1104
01:07:22,796 --> 01:07:25,294
You are fucking things up!
Between you and Johnny...

1105
01:07:25,462 --> 01:07:27,835
- ...you're gonna ruin everything for me.
- Ruin what?

1106
01:07:28,003 --> 01:07:29,461
"Ruin what?"

1107
01:07:32,003 --> 01:07:35,252
I'm sorry, Mrs. Rucco, pardon me.
Come on inside.

1108
01:07:36,127 --> 01:07:37,627
Why am I ruining everything?

1109
01:07:37,794 --> 01:07:41,960
Keep quiet! I'll give you
a slap in the mouth, Teresa! Shut up!

1110
01:07:42,127 --> 01:07:44,001
Listen to me for a minute.

1111
01:07:44,169 --> 01:07:46,210
My uncle's got me on it
to run a restaurant,

1112
01:07:46,211 --> 01:07:48,251
but I gotta stay away
from you and Johnny.

1113
01:07:48,418 --> 01:07:50,833
- Does he know about you and me?
- No.

1114
01:07:51,001 --> 01:07:52,917
Does he know about Johnny
and those loans?

1115
01:07:53,085 --> 01:07:55,750
No. What, are you kidding me?
Of course not.

1116
01:07:56,918 --> 01:08:00,874
He doesn't understand Johnny. You know,
he's just a kid who needs to be...

1117
01:08:01,042 --> 01:08:03,582
- Answer me.
- What do you want from me?

1118
01:08:03,750 --> 01:08:06,707
I said, do you feel the way
he does about me?

1119
01:08:06,875 --> 01:08:08,249
No.

1120
01:08:09,250 --> 01:08:11,957
I don't feel that way.
I don't want to stop seeing you.

1121
01:08:12,124 --> 01:08:14,457
What are you afraid of?

1122
01:08:15,582 --> 01:08:17,665
I love you.

1123
01:08:17,874 --> 01:08:19,540
- I don't wanna say that.
- What?

1124
01:08:19,707 --> 01:08:22,789
- That.
- What? That you love me?

1125
01:08:23,457 --> 01:08:24,789
Right.

1126
01:08:30,623 --> 01:08:32,288
All right, all right, all right.

1127
01:08:32,456 --> 01:08:34,663
Let's just get out of here.

1128
01:08:34,830 --> 01:08:38,788
Okay. Okay, but just...

1129
01:08:40,081 --> 01:08:43,995
Let me get the restaurant first, all right?
Then I think things are gonna be easier.

1130
01:08:44,163 --> 01:08:45,662
Okay.

1131
01:09:15,077 --> 01:09:17,784
So where have you been?

1132
01:09:17,952 --> 01:09:19,659
Around.

1133
01:09:19,826 --> 01:09:21,951
You heard what happened
to Groppi, huh?

1134
01:09:22,118 --> 01:09:24,200
Who, me? No.

1135
01:09:24,368 --> 01:09:27,991
Well, Oscar found out
where his partner is.

1136
01:09:28,159 --> 01:09:30,699
It seems Groppi went
to visit his mother.

1137
01:09:30,867 --> 01:09:33,449
He went to her room
where she was watching television...

1138
01:09:33,617 --> 01:09:35,991
...and he says to her he's sorry.

1139
01:09:36,158 --> 01:09:38,865
That's all. Just he's sorry.

1140
01:09:39,534 --> 01:09:42,573
He goes into the next room, gets a gun,
puts it in his mouth.

1141
01:09:42,741 --> 01:09:44,573
And that's it.

1142
01:09:46,075 --> 01:09:49,822
How do you like that? I tell you
that Groppi was always half-crazy.

1143
01:09:49,990 --> 01:09:52,198
Half-crazy to say the least.

1144
01:09:52,865 --> 01:09:54,365
Charlie.

1145
01:09:56,740 --> 01:09:58,405
What is it?

1146
01:09:58,865 --> 01:10:00,364
Not now, huh?

1147
01:10:00,532 --> 01:10:02,738
Doesn't he see that we are talking?

1148
01:10:02,906 --> 01:10:05,446
A couple of minutes, will you? Outside.

1149
01:10:09,113 --> 01:10:11,987
- What does he want?
- He wants to talk to me about something.

1150
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:15,363
Hey, you spit on my shoe.

1151
01:10:17,780 --> 01:10:20,986
Okay, Charlie,
a lot of aggravation though, you know.

1152
01:10:21,154 --> 01:10:22,570
Like Johnny Boy.

1153
01:10:22,738 --> 01:10:27,070
I figure I give him all the breaks
I can give him.

1154
01:10:27,238 --> 01:10:28,653
- Oh, look, Michael.
- No.

1155
01:10:28,820 --> 01:10:32,861
No, Charlie, it's no good, see?
He's a punk bastard, Charlie.

1156
01:10:33,028 --> 01:10:35,611
I call them down there at work
and I ask them...

1157
01:10:35,778 --> 01:10:38,777
...if Johnny Boy's there.
He doesn't even show up anymore.

1158
01:10:38,945 --> 01:10:41,069
- They told you that down at his place?
- Yeah.

1159
01:10:41,236 --> 01:10:43,026
How's he gonna pay me, Charlie?

1160
01:10:43,194 --> 01:10:46,443
Oh, I've talked to him
and I've talked to him.

1161
01:10:48,777 --> 01:10:51,943
- What more can I do?
- I don't know.

1162
01:10:53,568 --> 01:10:56,108
Tonight at the party,
the three of us get together...

1163
01:10:56,276 --> 01:10:58,900
...and we knock some sense
into his head. Okay?

1164
01:10:59,068 --> 01:11:04,066
All right, Charlie. You know I don't like
being taken advantage of.

1165
01:11:04,234 --> 01:11:07,066
I mean, you're inside there
with your uncle and all that.

1166
01:11:07,234 --> 01:11:09,024
It's kind of embarrassing for me.

1167
01:11:09,192 --> 01:11:11,233
I apologize, Michael.
We had some business.

1168
01:11:11,399 --> 01:11:14,107
- Private. You know what I mean?
- Yeah.

1169
01:11:14,274 --> 01:11:17,273
Oh. I'm late. I gotta meet somebody.
We'll settle it tonight.

1170
01:11:17,441 --> 01:11:18,814
- Okay.
- Ciao.

1171
01:11:18,982 --> 01:11:21,564
And, Michael, I appreciate
what you're doing for me.

1172
01:11:21,732 --> 01:11:23,232
All right.

1173
01:11:34,315 --> 01:11:38,481
<i>I love you so</i>

1174
01:11:38,548 --> 01:11:41,481

01:12:09,914 --> 01:12:14,112

<i>doo doo doo doo doo </i>

1187
01:12:31,518 --> 01:12:33,308
- Very intelligent too, you know?
- Yeah.

1188
01:12:33,476 --> 01:12:36,641
She's going to college.
She's gonna be a schoolteacher.

1189
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:41,766
- Only been out with her a couple of times.
- Yeah.

1190
01:12:41,934 --> 01:12:43,016
Her picture.

1191
01:12:43,183 --> 01:12:46,599
- Michael, let me see that picture.
- Yeah, she's gonna be a teacher.

1192
01:12:47,183 --> 01:12:50,265
- Oh, I know this girl.
- Yeah?

1193
01:12:50,432 --> 01:12:53,598
Yeah. I seen her kissing a nigger
under the bridge in Jersey.

1194
01:12:53,766 --> 01:12:56,097
- What are you talking about? Niggers.
- Ha, ha, ha.

1195
01:12:56,265 --> 01:12:59,056
A nigger, as in mulignan,
as in black. A nigger.

1196
01:12:59,224 --> 01:13:00,722
What do you mean, kissing?

1197
01:13:01,723 --> 01:13:06,013
I mean kissing. Her lips on his lips.
Kissing.

1198
01:13:06,181 --> 01:13:08,472
- You sure?
- I'm sure.

1199
01:13:10,264 --> 01:13:11,513
Ew.

1200
01:13:12,348 --> 01:13:14,888
Nigger. I kissed her.

1201
01:13:15,056 --> 01:13:17,262
Don't worry about it.
It'll be all right.

1202
01:13:19,076 --> 01:13:23,941
<i>love you for eternity </i>

1203
01:13:29,009 --> 01:13:31,341
<i>eternity</i>

1204
01:13:31,408 --> 01:13:37,074
<i>I spend my nights...</i>

1205
01:13:37,428 --> 01:13:42,260
Hallelujah. I've come to create order.
Carl, J&B and soda, please.

1206
01:13:42,428 --> 01:13:45,760
May God be with you
and with your spirit.

1207
01:13:50,552 --> 01:13:52,009
- Let me ask you something.
- What?

1208
01:13:52,177 --> 01:13:54,092
Art thou the king of the Jews?

1209
01:13:54,718 --> 01:13:58,134
Does thou say this of thyself
or have others told thee of me?

1210
01:13:58,301 --> 01:13:59,342
Am I a Jew?

1211
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:01,425
My kingdom's not of this world.

1212
01:14:01,593 --> 01:14:04,799
Jerry, hey, how you doing? Wow.

1213
01:14:05,384 --> 01:14:07,050
Oh, hey.

1214
01:14:11,258 --> 01:14:13,174
To Jerry...

1215
01:14:14,258 --> 01:14:16,257
...who served in Vietnam.

1216
01:14:16,425 --> 01:14:18,132
The immortal words of John Garfield:

1217
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:20,757
"Get him in the eyes,
get him right in the eyes."

1218
01:14:21,424 --> 01:14:24,590
Came back with a Silver Star.
From the boys.

1219
01:14:25,924 --> 01:14:28,672
Hey, Carl! Drinks for everybody!

1220
01:14:30,381 --> 01:14:31,756
Drinks for everybody!

1221
01:14:35,757 --> 01:14:37,755
Hey, drinks for everybody!

1222
01:14:39,506 --> 01:14:43,047
- Drinks for everybody.
- Could make a shirt out of that, Jerry.

1223
01:14:51,130 --> 01:14:53,545
- We drink and then we bullshiting!
- We're bullshiting!

1224
01:14:56,921 --> 01:14:58,086
George.

1225
01:14:58,254 --> 01:15:00,128
- George, my man.
- Watch this.

1226
01:15:01,670 --> 01:15:03,711
Put your mouth down there.

1227
01:15:31,043 --> 01:15:32,083
- Michael.
- What?

1228
01:15:32,251 --> 01:15:34,209
Play only old ones tonight.

1229
01:15:36,168 --> 01:15:38,042
Only old ones.

1230
01:15:38,250 --> 01:15:39,666
All right.

1231
01:16:01,749 --> 01:16:03,372
Do that again

1232
01:16:20,371 --> 01:16:22,204
Did you ever hear of a wish sandwich?

1233
01:16:22,371 --> 01:16:25,662
Well, it's the kind of sandwich that you're
Supposed to take to pieces of bread

1234
01:16:25,829 --> 01:16:27,912
And wish you had some meat

1235
01:16:45,077 --> 01:16:46,993
The other day I ate a ricochet biscuit

1236
01:16:47,161 --> 01:16:50,368
Well, it's the kind of biscuit
That's supposed to bounce off the wall

1237
01:16:50,536 --> 01:16:51,618
Back in your mouth

1238
01:16:51,785 --> 01:16:53,493
If it don't bounce back

1239
01:16:53,660 --> 01:16:55,493
You go hungry

1240
01:17:16,742 --> 01:17:19,115
Charlie, Flash ain't here yet.

1241
01:17:20,742 --> 01:17:21,990
He said he'd be here.

1242
01:17:22,158 --> 01:17:25,865
Well, he isn't. Nice, real nice.

1243
01:17:29,741 --> 01:17:33,406
- He'll be here. He'll be here.
- All right.

1244
01:17:34,948 --> 01:17:36,780
Look...

1245
01:17:36,948 --> 01:17:39,072
...I'll give you 20 bucks
to hold you for now.

1246
01:17:39,239 --> 01:17:43,238
What, are you kidding? Twenty dollars
doesn't pay the interest for two hours.

1247
01:17:44,198 --> 01:17:47,863
- Now with the vig, it's almost 3000.
- Three thousand?

1248
01:17:49,072 --> 01:17:53,029
Shit, you charge a guy
from the neighborhood 1800 vig?

1249
01:17:54,071 --> 01:17:56,987
- One day he's late with his payments.
- What am I, his father?

1250
01:17:57,571 --> 01:18:00,237
You could have come to me
a little sooner, friend.

1251
01:18:00,404 --> 01:18:02,195
Charlie, this is business.

1252
01:18:02,404 --> 01:18:06,903
Well, then be realistic, Michael.
Where's he gonna come up with $3000, huh?

1253
01:18:07,070 --> 01:18:08,403
Let's work something out.

1254
01:18:10,570 --> 01:18:11,944
Make it 1800.

1255
01:18:12,112 --> 01:18:13,235
Don't hustle me.

1256
01:18:13,403 --> 01:18:15,319
I'm not hustling you.

1257
01:18:20,361 --> 01:18:22,568
Let's make it 2000.

1258
01:18:25,569 --> 01:18:27,735
All right, now you're being
sensible about it.

1259
01:18:27,902 --> 01:18:30,485
I swear to Jesus Christ
and the goddamn cross.

1260
01:18:30,651 --> 01:18:33,775
If he thinks he's making a jerk-off
out of me, I'll break his legs.

1261
01:18:33,943 --> 01:18:36,025
Michael, come on, huh?

1262
01:18:36,860 --> 01:18:38,983
You should have the sense
not to get involved.

1263
01:18:39,151 --> 01:18:41,649
- Don't tell me what to do, huh?
- I'm telling you the truth.

1264
01:18:41,942 --> 01:18:44,691
The fucking truth is
you're more involved than anybody.

1265
01:18:44,859 --> 01:18:46,649
What do I look like, a jerk?

1266
01:18:47,734 --> 01:18:50,107
Next payday
I'm coming down here to Tony's.

1267
01:18:50,275 --> 01:18:52,690
Johnny Boy better show
or I'm gonna find him...

1268
01:18:52,858 --> 01:18:55,024
...and I'm gonna break his fucking legs.

1269
01:18:55,192 --> 01:18:57,231
We understand each other?

1270
01:18:57,941 --> 01:18:59,732
I heard you.

1271
01:19:02,274 --> 01:19:03,981
Good.

1272
01:19:06,232 --> 01:19:08,481
Amen, I say to thee.

1273
01:19:09,231 --> 01:19:13,397
Thou will not come out from it
till thou hast paid the last penny.

1274
01:19:16,064 --> 01:19:17,521
Michael, you look tired.

1275
01:19:17,689 --> 01:19:19,605
You said it.

1276
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:30,770
<i>Forever my darling</i>

1277
01:19:32,313 --> 01:19:34,853
<i>Our love will be true</i>

1278
01:19:37,062 --> 01:19:39,644

1279
01:19:39,812 --> 01:19:41,061
Jerry!

1280
01:19:42,187 --> 01:19:44,728
Come on, Jerry! Come on! Jerry!

1281
01:19:44,895 --> 01:19:46,227
Easy, man!

1282
01:19:46,395 --> 01:19:49,351
Jerry, take it easy! Take it easy!
You're in America, Jerry!

1283
01:19:49,895 --> 01:19:52,852
<i>Your love in return</i>

1284
01:19:53,935 --> 01:19:55,393
<i>May this fire in my soul</i>

1285
01:19:55,561 --> 01:19:57,934
Jerry, easy! Come on, easy!

1286
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:03,976
Let him go, fellas. Let him go.

1287
01:20:11,767 --> 01:20:13,892
<i>I'll forever love you</i>

1288
01:20:16,058 --> 01:20:19,224
<i>For the rest of my days</i>

1289
01:20:20,142 --> 01:20:23,432
<i>I'll never part from you</i>

1290
01:20:24,308 --> 01:20:28,015
<i>And your loving ways</i>

1291
01:20:30,475 --> 01:20:32,015
Dance?

1292
01:20:47,681 --> 01:20:51,846
<i>My heart's at your command, dear</i>

1293
01:20:52,139 --> 01:20:55,387
<i>To keep love and to hold</i>

1294
01:20:56,388 --> 01:20:58,220
Do you like this song?

1295
01:20:58,388 --> 01:20:59,637
Hm?

1296
01:21:00,305 --> 01:21:03,554
<i>Keeping you is my goal</i>

1297
01:21:03,721 --> 01:21:06,887

<i>I'll never part from you</i>

1300
01:21:16,262 --> 01:21:20,135
<i>And your loving ways</i>

1301
01:21:33,552 --> 01:21:35,842
Charlie, there's a girl here to see you.

1302
01:21:40,384 --> 01:21:43,592
- Charlie?
- What is it? What's the matter?

1303
01:21:43,759 --> 01:21:46,091
Johnny Boy is up on that building
on the corner.

1304
01:21:46,259 --> 01:21:48,133
He's been on the roof for half an hour.

1305
01:21:48,301 --> 01:21:50,799
- All right, don't get excited.
- He's got a gun.

1306
01:21:50,967 --> 01:21:52,716
Don't get excited.

1307
01:21:53,216 --> 01:21:55,090
- You stay here.
- I'm coming with you.

1308
01:21:55,258 --> 01:21:57,007
- Teresa, stay here.
- I don't want to...

1309
01:21:57,175 --> 01:21:58,466
Shh! You stay here. Tony.

1310
01:21:58,632 --> 01:22:00,465
Yeah, Teresa, stay here.

1311
01:22:00,924 --> 01:22:02,798
- Have a drink.
- I don't want a drink.

1312
01:22:02,966 --> 01:22:04,882
- Give Teresa a drink.
- I don't want one.

1313
01:22:05,048 --> 01:22:06,131
Have a drink.

1314
01:22:06,299 --> 01:22:08,714
- I'll have a Seven and Seven.
- Okay.

1315
01:22:11,631 --> 01:22:13,839
- Charlie.
- Watch out. Come here. Come here.

1316
01:22:14,007 --> 01:22:16,005
Crazy bastard's up on the roof.

1317
01:22:19,631 --> 01:22:22,921
- Johnny! It's me, Charlie!
- Hey, watch this!

1318
01:22:23,089 --> 01:22:25,713
I'll shoot the light out
on the Empire State Building.

1319
01:22:25,881 --> 01:22:28,337
Hey, cut it out, stupid. It's me.

1320
01:22:35,629 --> 01:22:37,712
Bobby, stop fucking around. Come on.

1321
01:22:38,796 --> 01:22:40,295
Hey, what do you got up there?

1322
01:22:40,463 --> 01:22:41,961
A .38!

1323
01:22:42,129 --> 01:22:44,919
- That ain't real, is it?
- Yeah.

1324
01:22:45,462 --> 01:22:48,836
What's the matter with him?
I'm gonna throw that fucker off the roof.

1325
01:22:54,378 --> 01:22:59,043
Oh, shit. Hey, lady, I'm sorry.
Lady, I didn't mean it, I swear to God.

1326
01:22:59,294 --> 01:23:01,209
I'm very sorry.

1327
01:23:01,586 --> 01:23:03,543
Are you crazy? What are you doing?

1328
01:23:03,710 --> 01:23:05,418
I scared the shit out of her.

1329
01:23:05,585 --> 01:23:07,126
Very funny. Give me that.

1330
01:23:07,294 --> 01:23:10,375
I hate that lady.
I tried to get her clothesline.

1331
01:23:10,543 --> 01:23:12,292
- What's the matter?
- What do you mean?

1332
01:23:12,460 --> 01:23:14,459
You have Teresa half-crazy about this.

1333
01:23:14,626 --> 01:23:16,958
I wasn't shooting at nobody.
Just up in the air.

1334
01:23:17,126 --> 01:23:19,624
I want to wake up the neighborhood.
It's dead.

1335
01:23:19,792 --> 01:23:22,916
I hate that woman
with a vengeance, a passion.

1336
01:23:25,417 --> 01:23:28,748
- You and your numbers.
- Fucking chickenshits.

1337
01:23:30,167 --> 01:23:33,206
- Back to Bataan.
- Heh, back to...

1338
01:23:33,541 --> 01:23:35,914
Now they're gonna get
a real back to Bataan.

1339
01:23:36,082 --> 01:23:38,039
An atom bomb,
wake up the neighborhood.

1340
01:23:38,458 --> 01:23:40,831
- What the fuck? Put that out.
- Put what out?

1341
01:23:40,999 --> 01:23:43,622
- Johnny, put that out.
- A surprise. You want to see?

1342
01:23:43,832 --> 01:23:46,664
- Want to see?
- Johnny, put that... Hey!

1343
01:23:46,831 --> 01:23:49,247
Give me... Put that... Get the fuck...

1344
01:24:05,455 --> 01:24:07,745
Let's hide in here for a while. Come on.

1345
01:24:07,954 --> 01:24:10,203
Come on with this door. Come on.

1346
01:24:10,371 --> 01:24:13,245
What are you kicking?
Get in there. - About time.

1347
01:24:16,704 --> 01:24:18,994
Remember we used to play
hide-and-seek here?

1348
01:24:19,162 --> 01:24:21,952
Never mind that.
What's this crap about last week?

1349
01:24:22,120 --> 01:24:23,952
- What? What?
- "What?"

1350
01:24:24,120 --> 01:24:26,618
You got some balls
not showing up for work last week.

1351
01:24:26,786 --> 01:24:29,368
After all we had to do
to get you on that truck, stupid.

1352
01:24:29,536 --> 01:24:30,826
What's the matter with you?

1353
01:24:30,994 --> 01:24:33,034
Charlie, come on. My hand was hurting...

1354
01:24:33,202 --> 01:24:36,034
Your hand was hurting.
Your mouth's gonna hurt from this kick.

1355
01:24:36,202 --> 01:24:39,409
For what? Hey, I swear to you,
what are you talking about?

1356
01:24:39,577 --> 01:24:41,576
Besides, I don't like loading crates.

1357
01:24:41,743 --> 01:24:44,117
You're not supposed to like it.

1358
01:24:45,034 --> 01:24:47,075
- What gets me is your attitude.
- My attitude?

1359
01:24:47,243 --> 01:24:51,241
What gets me is your attitude.
Did you ever load crates?

1360
01:24:51,617 --> 01:24:52,991
- You don't work.
- My attitude.

1361
01:24:53,159 --> 01:24:55,657
You tell me to go to work
and you do all the talking.

1362
01:24:55,825 --> 01:24:58,032
- What do you do?
- I'll tell you what I don't do:

1363
01:24:58,200 --> 01:25:01,365
I don't owe anybody 2000 clams, stupid.

1364
01:25:04,199 --> 01:25:07,031
I got Michael to make it 2000,
give you a break on that.

1365
01:25:07,199 --> 01:25:08,573
Oh, yeah?

1366
01:25:08,740 --> 01:25:11,197
Go to work tomorrow
or I'll break both your arms.

1367
01:25:11,365 --> 01:25:13,030
- We understand each other?
- Yeah.

1368
01:25:13,198 --> 01:25:15,989
Hey, I'm sorry, Charlie.
I really am. I mean...

1369
01:25:16,157 --> 01:25:19,697
...because I appreciate everything
you're doing for me. I mean, I do.

1370
01:25:21,865 --> 01:25:25,196
So I was figuring that the next
logical thing to do... Don't get mad.

1371
01:25:25,364 --> 01:25:26,696
- How?
- I know how you get.

1372
01:25:26,864 --> 01:25:28,612
- You know a way out of this?
- Yeah.

1373
01:25:28,780 --> 01:25:30,280
Oh, let me hear this one.

1374
01:25:31,114 --> 01:25:32,279
Talk to your uncle.

1375
01:25:34,321 --> 01:25:38,028
Oh, that'd be just really great for you,
wouldn't it, huh?

1376
01:25:38,196 --> 01:25:39,736
But not for me.

1377
01:25:39,904 --> 01:25:44,278
Johnny, one word out of your mouth,
my uncle hears one word about this...

1378
01:25:45,654 --> 01:25:47,319
All right. Hey.

1379
01:25:47,487 --> 01:25:49,694
I was just asking, that's all.

1380
01:25:50,070 --> 01:25:52,236
That's what I get for getting involved.

1381
01:25:52,987 --> 01:25:54,360
Look...

1382
01:25:54,528 --> 01:25:58,068
...on payday, at least show up
at Tony's place to meet him, okay?

1383
01:25:58,236 --> 01:26:01,318
This way he won't think you're trying
to make a jerk-off out of him.

1384
01:26:01,486 --> 01:26:04,693
- Yeah, all right.
- Hey! I'm not asking you, I'm telling you!

1385
01:26:04,861 --> 01:26:06,734
Yeah.

1386
01:26:59,564 --> 01:27:01,229
- Johnny, come on.
- What?

1387
01:27:01,397 --> 01:27:02,604
Come on.

1388
01:27:02,772 --> 01:27:05,604
- What, we going now?
- Let's go.

1389
01:27:26,770 --> 01:27:29,601
- Hey, Shorty!
- Fuck you, Charlie, will you?

1390
01:27:30,395 --> 01:27:32,852
Shorts, you must be having
illusions of grandeur.

1391
01:27:33,019 --> 01:27:35,059
What do you want from me? Talk to him.

1392
01:27:35,561 --> 01:27:38,143
Gonna see you and Johnny Boy
down here tonight, right?

1393
01:27:38,310 --> 01:27:39,601
Yeah, we'll be here.

1394
01:27:39,768 --> 01:27:43,268
I'm telling you, Charlie, that kid doesn't
show up tonight, I'll find him.

1395
01:27:43,435 --> 01:27:45,101
I'm gonna drag him down here.

1396
01:27:45,685 --> 01:27:48,016
I'll tie one of his legs
to that Cadillac bumper.

1397
01:27:48,184 --> 01:27:51,100
I'll tie the other to
the Ford, and boom!

1398
01:27:53,017 --> 01:27:54,183
We'll be here.

1399
01:27:54,350 --> 01:27:55,933
Better be here, Charlie.

1400
01:27:56,101 --> 01:27:58,932
Michael, don't you fucking threaten me.

1401
01:28:02,933 --> 01:28:05,765
Miss? Excuse me, miss? Miss?

1402
01:28:06,474 --> 01:28:07,765
What? What do you want?

1403
01:28:07,933 --> 01:28:11,348
I just want you to tell your cousin Johnny
he's gotta see Michael tonight.

1404
01:28:11,516 --> 01:28:14,181
- Then tell him yourself.
- Love to. Where can I find him?

1405
01:28:14,349 --> 01:28:17,181
- I don't know. He doesn't live here.
- He's here all the time.

1406
01:28:17,348 --> 01:28:19,514
- Fuck you.
- Fuck me?

1407
01:28:19,682 --> 01:28:21,556
What do I have to take
from these people?

1408
01:28:22,390 --> 01:28:24,139
Look what you did, you...

1409
01:28:26,472 --> 01:28:28,346
Here.

1410
01:28:30,014 --> 01:28:31,054
What am I doing?

1411
01:28:31,222 --> 01:28:34,012
Would you just give me
my fucking eggplant, please?

1412
01:28:38,180 --> 01:28:41,345
- You got some mouth, you know that?
- Get out of here.

1413
01:28:45,263 --> 01:28:48,636
Now just be sure and tell him
to be here tonight, all right?

1414
01:29:28,592 --> 01:29:30,799
You sure he didn't say anything
about tonight?

1415
01:29:30,967 --> 01:29:32,590
I told you before, nothing.

1416
01:29:33,842 --> 01:29:37,841
Charlie, will you listen to me? I can't
stay here too long at this time of night.

1417
01:29:38,007 --> 01:29:40,840
Now, Michael was looking for him.

1418
01:29:41,674 --> 01:29:43,464
- What's happening?
- Nothing.

1419
01:29:45,382 --> 01:29:47,381
I don't believe you.

1420
01:29:49,590 --> 01:29:50,673
Son of a bitch.

1421
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:53,505
What? What did you just say?

1422
01:29:53,673 --> 01:29:55,797
Teresa, watch the hands already.

1423
01:30:37,460 --> 01:30:40,709
Charlie. Charlie, what do you think?

1424
01:30:43,085 --> 01:30:46,167
Look, why don't you realize
what this apartment means?

1425
01:30:48,459 --> 01:30:50,959
Maybe after a while
you could even move in yourself.

1426
01:30:51,127 --> 01:30:54,708
Enough with that apartment already!
I don't want to hear anymore!

1427
01:30:54,875 --> 01:30:56,874
I got enough on my hands
with your cousin.

1428
01:30:57,042 --> 01:31:00,666
You wanna move? Go on, move.
But leave me out of it!

1429
01:32:28,243 --> 01:32:32,116
Teresa, I didn't mean that,
but we've got a situation right now.

1430
01:32:32,283 --> 01:32:33,907
- Yeah, a situation.
- Come on.

1431
01:32:34,075 --> 01:32:37,824
Look, go and play your fucking games
with that dumb kid. I don't care.

1432
01:32:38,616 --> 01:32:40,323
Teresa, it's no game.

1433
01:32:49,990 --> 01:32:52,989
- Hey, hello.
- Where were you?

1434
01:32:53,156 --> 01:32:54,364
Where was I? I was around.

1435
01:32:54,532 --> 01:32:56,489
Answer me, son of a bitch.
Where were you?

1436
01:32:56,657 --> 01:32:57,863
- Charlie.
- Shut up!

1437
01:32:58,031 --> 01:33:01,280
Shut up, Teresa. We don't want
to get Charlie in trouble here, do we?

1438
01:33:01,447 --> 01:33:04,405
Don't be cute.
You had me going crazy here!

1439
01:33:04,572 --> 01:33:06,405
- Yeah?
- What's the matter with you?

1440
01:33:06,572 --> 01:33:08,071
What's the matter with you?

1441
01:33:08,239 --> 01:33:11,446
- About an hour and a half late.
- Oh, that's too bad.

1442
01:33:12,780 --> 01:33:16,153
Michael's waiting for us.
You forget or what?

1443
01:33:17,488 --> 01:33:19,986
Your cousin was getting sick
worrying about you.

1444
01:33:20,154 --> 01:33:22,611
We had to start calling up everybody!

1445
01:33:23,737 --> 01:33:27,486
Yeah? That's too bad.
Isn't that too bad?

1446
01:33:27,654 --> 01:33:29,778
Huh, Teresa?

1447
01:33:29,945 --> 01:33:32,444
So, kiddies,
youse make any plans yet, or what?

1448
01:33:32,611 --> 01:33:35,568
- When are you getting married? Engaged?
- Don't be smart.

1449
01:33:35,736 --> 01:33:37,610
What do you mean?
I'm stupid, remember?

1450
01:33:37,778 --> 01:33:39,276
- You heard me.
- I'm a stronzo.

1451
01:33:39,444 --> 01:33:42,485
I'm so stupid
you gotta look out for me, right?

1452
01:33:42,652 --> 01:33:45,110
Right? Yeah.

1453
01:33:45,277 --> 01:33:48,110
What's the matter? Hey, Teresa.

1454
01:33:48,276 --> 01:33:50,900
Look, she's upset.
Now, what are you so upset about?

1455
01:33:51,068 --> 01:33:52,442
You don't understand Charlie.

1456
01:33:52,610 --> 01:33:55,359
Charlie likes everybody,
everybody likes Charlie.

1457
01:33:55,526 --> 01:33:57,650
- Enough. Enough.
- Fucking politician over here.

1458
01:33:57,818 --> 01:33:59,483
- Watch your mouth!
- I'm going home.

1459
01:33:59,776 --> 01:34:01,982
Hey, no. Wait, Teresa!
Teresa, whoa, whoa!

1460
01:34:02,150 --> 01:34:03,857
Oh, Teresa, come on, stay here.

1461
01:34:04,025 --> 01:34:07,316
I don't wanna break up
a nice, happy household here.

1462
01:34:07,483 --> 01:34:09,649
Johnny, Johnny, stop fooling around.

1463
01:34:09,817 --> 01:34:12,482
I swear to God, if you open
your mouth about any of this...

1464
01:34:12,650 --> 01:34:13,981
About what?

1465
01:34:14,149 --> 01:34:17,107
- You know what I'm talking about.
- About what? You two?

1466
01:34:17,274 --> 01:34:20,523
Hey, who cares? I won't even say nothing
to my aunt and uncle.

1467
01:34:20,690 --> 01:34:22,815
The guys don't give a shit.
What do they care?

1468
01:34:22,981 --> 01:34:25,231
I won't even say nothing
to your uncle Giovanni.

1469
01:34:25,399 --> 01:34:27,398
- I'm not fooling around.
- Come here!

1470
01:34:27,564 --> 01:34:30,480
- As a matter of fact, I just talked
to him. - Oh, yeah? What?

1471
01:34:30,648 --> 01:34:33,397
What? No, I won't say nothing
to Giovanni, that's all.

1472
01:34:33,564 --> 01:34:35,563
I wanted to ask you something, Charlie.

1473
01:34:35,773 --> 01:34:38,979
I always wondered about her.
This is the God's honest truth.

1474
01:34:39,147 --> 01:34:42,479
I always wondered about what happens
when she comes. She get a fit?

1475
01:34:42,647 --> 01:34:45,270
- What's that?
- What happens when she comes? I mean...

1476
01:34:46,854 --> 01:34:50,062
You dirty, fucking bastard!
Don't ever hit me again!

1477
01:34:50,230 --> 01:34:51,603
Don't!

1478
01:34:53,604 --> 01:34:54,812
I will tell your uncle.

1479
01:34:54,979 --> 01:34:56,645
- Go ahead.
- Right now.

1480
01:34:56,813 --> 01:34:58,311
Go on!

1481
01:34:58,562 --> 01:35:00,811
I'll tear your fucking eyes
out of your head!

1482
01:35:00,978 --> 01:35:04,644
- I'm gonna kill you, bastard!
- Go on!

1483
01:35:05,895 --> 01:35:07,310
Teresa!

1484
01:35:07,478 --> 01:35:10,310
Teresa! What do you do?
You know about this?

1485
01:35:10,520 --> 01:35:11,559
Johnny!

1486
01:35:13,103 --> 01:35:15,393
Hey, how should I know?
She's your fucking girl.

1487
01:35:15,769 --> 01:35:17,935
- Teresa. Get over here.
- I gotta go.

1488
01:35:18,102 --> 01:35:19,726
- Come here!
- Get off me!

1489
01:35:20,477 --> 01:35:22,518
Teresa?

1490
01:35:25,518 --> 01:35:28,517
Hey, you know what to do?
Hey, you know what to do?

1491
01:35:31,267 --> 01:35:33,641
I don't know. She had an attack.

1492
01:35:48,141 --> 01:35:51,931
You meeting my uncle? Huh?
After what I've done for you?

1493
01:35:52,099 --> 01:35:55,014
What do you mean what you did for me?

1494
01:35:55,890 --> 01:35:57,472
Why you talking to him?

1495
01:35:57,640 --> 01:36:01,263
What do you mean what you did for me?
You didn't do nothing for me, you fuck!

1496
01:36:01,640 --> 01:36:03,846
Fucking bastard.
You're a fucking bastard.

1497
01:36:04,014 --> 01:36:06,055
- Talk to me. What?
- You fucking bastard.

1498
01:36:06,223 --> 01:36:07,763
Come on, what are you doing?

1499
01:36:07,931 --> 01:36:09,638
What you doing for me?

1500
01:36:10,263 --> 01:36:12,930
Don't show up tonight.
We'll see what happens to you.

1501
01:36:18,430 --> 01:36:20,595
How much money you got
for Michael tonight?

1502
01:36:22,137 --> 01:36:24,220
- I got nothing.
- You got anything?

1503
01:36:24,388 --> 01:36:26,637
I got 8 fucking dollars on me.

1504
01:36:29,970 --> 01:36:32,803
Well, then, here. Take 20.

1505
01:36:32,970 --> 01:36:36,219
Take 22. At your rate,
that'll make $30 we'll give to Michael.

1506
01:36:36,387 --> 01:36:38,511
I'll keep 11 for the weekend.

1507
01:36:38,844 --> 01:36:40,802
Maybe we'll get some chinks later.

1508
01:36:41,928 --> 01:36:45,593
Take it, stupid, I'm doing it for you.
Come on. Come on.

1509
01:36:45,761 --> 01:36:47,718
Carrying on, huh? Cut it out, will you?

1510
01:36:47,885 --> 01:36:50,343
Come on, 30 bucks ain't nothing,
you know that.

1511
01:36:50,511 --> 01:36:53,259
The only way you're gonna do
is if you talk to your uncle.

1512
01:36:53,426 --> 01:36:54,467
- That's it.
- Forget it.

1513
01:36:54,635 --> 01:36:57,467
- Why not?
- I ain't gonna do it. Forget about that.

1514
01:36:57,635 --> 01:36:59,966
You all right? Did I hurt you?

1515
01:37:01,468 --> 01:37:02,925
Come on.

1516
01:37:12,966 --> 01:37:17,757
You're over an hour late.
Michael said he'd be back, though.

1517
01:37:21,799 --> 01:37:24,131
- Have a drink.
- I don't want any.

1518
01:37:29,590 --> 01:37:31,506
Hey, cut it out, will you?

1519
01:37:36,298 --> 01:37:38,797
- Where you going?
- I'm going to the bathroom.

1520
01:37:39,464 --> 01:37:41,962
All right, now.
Take it easy, don't get excited.

1521
01:37:44,713 --> 01:37:46,129
No.

1522
01:37:50,755 --> 01:37:52,253
Who's the girl?

1523
01:37:52,421 --> 01:37:53,462
Jewish.

1524
01:37:53,630 --> 01:37:56,295
- How do you know?
- Look at her.

1525
01:37:56,754 --> 01:37:57,961
She don't look Jewish.

1526
01:37:58,129 --> 01:38:01,586
She's in here every night with
a different guy. You know how they are.

1527
01:38:07,253 --> 01:38:08,960
I love you.

1528
01:38:10,295 --> 01:38:12,461
Ever since that first
day at the convent when

1529
01:38:12,462 --> 01:38:14,627
I saw you playing
volleyball with the nuns...

1530
01:38:14,795 --> 01:38:16,293
...I couldn't help myself.

1531
01:38:18,461 --> 01:38:20,085
- Let's go.
- Fuck off.

1532
01:38:20,252 --> 01:38:23,126
- Let's go.
- You go. I'm staying.

1533
01:38:23,418 --> 01:38:26,709
It's obvious the girl doesn't want
to go with you. What do you think?

1534
01:38:26,876 --> 01:38:29,958
- Hey, look, fella, this is private.
- Nothing is private.

1535
01:38:30,126 --> 01:38:32,250
I wanna go.

1536
01:38:32,417 --> 01:38:34,708
Whether she wants to go or not,
she's not gonna go.

1537
01:38:34,876 --> 01:38:35,958
Let go of her.

1538
01:38:36,125 --> 01:38:37,708
- Take her away.
- You're hurting me!

1539
01:38:37,875 --> 01:38:40,083
Physically, you take her away from me.
Go ahead.

1540
01:38:41,167 --> 01:38:43,874
- All right.
- Fuck you, bastard!

1541
01:38:51,916 --> 01:38:53,414
Hey, Joyce.

1542
01:38:53,582 --> 01:38:56,206
Yeah, maybe we'll meet
at bingo some night.

1543
01:39:08,456 --> 01:39:09,538
Hey, Mike.

1544
01:39:12,623 --> 01:39:14,913
What's the story, John?

1545
01:39:15,580 --> 01:39:19,371
I was here earlier tonight.
You kept me waiting for an hour.

1546
01:39:19,538 --> 01:39:21,454
Hey, I'm sorry, Mikey, but you know...

1547
01:39:21,622 --> 01:39:23,037
...I had something to do.

1548
01:39:23,205 --> 01:39:27,120
But I got something for you.
Not much, but I got something for you.

1549
01:39:28,788 --> 01:39:32,536
He has about $30.
That's all he's got on him, Michael.

1550
01:39:35,079 --> 01:39:37,494
- Where's the rest?
- Yeah, where's the rest?

1551
01:39:37,912 --> 01:39:41,619
I bought a few rounds of drinks
while I was waiting. You know, I mean...

1552
01:39:43,370 --> 01:39:46,202
Tony says my credit
ain't no good no more.

1553
01:39:50,619 --> 01:39:53,618
You know, $30 is enough of an insult.

1554
01:39:54,452 --> 01:39:56,368
But I'd take it for Charlie here.

1555
01:39:56,619 --> 01:39:58,326
But 10 dollars?

1556
01:39:58,493 --> 01:39:59,867
John.

1557
01:40:00,743 --> 01:40:01,909
Ten dollars?

1558
01:40:11,242 --> 01:40:12,908
Hey, Mike...

1559
01:40:15,908 --> 01:40:19,407
You're really something, you know that?
You too good for this $10, huh?

1560
01:40:19,574 --> 01:40:21,865
You too good for it? It's a good $10.

1561
01:40:23,366 --> 01:40:25,156
You know something, Mikey?

1562
01:40:25,324 --> 01:40:27,615
You make me laugh, you know that?

1563
01:40:27,783 --> 01:40:30,031
I borrow money
all over this neighborhood...

1564
01:40:30,199 --> 01:40:32,614
...from everybody,
and I never paid them back.

1565
01:40:32,782 --> 01:40:35,739
So I can't borrow no money
from nobody no more, right?

1566
01:40:35,907 --> 01:40:38,572
Who does that leave me
to borrow money from but you?

1567
01:40:38,864 --> 01:40:41,946
I borrow money from you because
you're the only jerk-off around...

1568
01:40:42,114 --> 01:40:46,154
...that I could borrow money from
without paying back, right? Right?

1569
01:40:46,322 --> 01:40:50,945
Because that's what you are.
That's what I think of you, a jerk-off.

1570
01:40:51,155 --> 01:40:54,528
He's smiling. Because you're a jerk-off.
Ha, ha, ha.

1571
01:40:54,696 --> 01:40:56,570
You're a fucking jerk-off.

1572
01:40:57,321 --> 01:40:59,779
And I'll tell you something else.

1573
01:40:59,945 --> 01:41:02,111
Mikey, I fucked you right
where you breathe...

1574
01:41:02,279 --> 01:41:05,903
...because I don't give two shits
about you or nobody else.

1575
01:41:09,029 --> 01:41:10,943
Easy, easy!

1576
01:41:11,737 --> 01:41:13,651
Come on. Come on. Come on.

1577
01:41:14,070 --> 01:41:15,860
Come on. Come on, fuckface!

1578
01:41:16,195 --> 01:41:17,777
Come on. Come on.

1579
01:41:18,611 --> 01:41:20,902
I got something for you, motherfucker!
Come on.

1580
01:41:21,943 --> 01:41:23,734
Come on. Come on, motherfucker.

1581
01:41:23,902 --> 01:41:24,984
I'm a bigshot.

1582
01:41:25,152 --> 01:41:27,360
Come on. Come on.

1583
01:41:27,735 --> 01:41:30,442
Come on, DD, disappointed duncesky.

1584
01:41:30,610 --> 01:41:33,609
Right, asshole. Come on. Come on.

1585
01:41:33,777 --> 01:41:34,900
You don't have the...

1586
01:41:35,068 --> 01:41:37,983
- You don't have the guts to use it.
- I don't, huh?

1587
01:41:38,151 --> 01:41:40,941
I don't have the guts.
Come on, asshole. Come over here.

1588
01:41:41,109 --> 01:41:42,775
I'll put this up your ass.

1589
01:41:47,733 --> 01:41:50,482
Hey, asshole! This is for you, asshole!

1590
01:41:50,649 --> 01:41:52,648
Fucking asshole.

1591
01:41:53,608 --> 01:41:56,315
You stupid bastard,
were you gonna use that?

1592
01:41:56,483 --> 01:41:57,648
Were you gonna use that?

1593
01:41:57,815 --> 01:42:00,273
I'll fucking...
I'll fucking kill you, Johnny!

1594
01:42:00,440 --> 01:42:02,564
That is fucking it!

1595
01:42:04,815 --> 01:42:06,439
Big fucking man!

1596
01:42:16,397 --> 01:42:17,563
All right.

1597
01:42:19,439 --> 01:42:20,937
So now you did it.

1598
01:42:24,897 --> 01:42:26,937
No bullets in this.

1599
01:42:28,688 --> 01:42:29,936
Now you did it.

1600
01:42:30,438 --> 01:42:32,479
Get him out of here
before this blows up.

1601
01:42:32,645 --> 01:42:35,269
Hide the gun, Tony. Throw it away.

1602
01:42:36,604 --> 01:42:39,728
Listen, Tony, I gotta borrow your car.
We ought to take a ride.

1603
01:42:39,895 --> 01:42:41,852
We shouldn't be around here now.

1604
01:42:44,395 --> 01:42:45,852
Okay.

1605
01:42:46,394 --> 01:42:48,560
Don't drive around.
Go to a movie or something.

1606
01:42:48,728 --> 01:42:51,934
This is no good, all right?
You know what I mean?

1607
01:42:52,644 --> 01:42:54,976
- You understand?
- Maybe.

1608
01:43:00,060 --> 01:43:01,892
You got what you wanted.

1609
01:43:18,600 --> 01:43:20,766
<i>It's really something to see</i>

1610
01:43:20,933 --> 01:43:23,098
<i>Lum-dee-lum-dee-la</i>

1611
01:43:23,266 --> 01:43:26,098
<i>This cat named Mickey
Doing that monkey</i>

1612
01:43:26,266 --> 01:43:27,806
<i>Lum-dee-lum-dee-la</i>

1613
01:43:27,974 --> 01:43:31,389
<i>Come on let's do Mickey's monkey, children</i>

1614
01:43:31,557 --> 01:43:33,556
<i>Do Mickey's monkey, children</i>

1615
01:43:33,724 --> 01:43:36,514
<i>Yeah, let's do Mickey's monkey, children</i>

1616
01:43:36,681 --> 01:43:39,348
<i>Do Mickey's monkey, children</i>

1617
01:43:39,514 --> 01:43:42,014
<i>Lum-dee-lum-dee-la</i>

1618
01:43:42,181 --> 01:43:43,513
Get in.

1619
01:43:44,097 --> 01:43:46,138
Get in the car, John!

1620
01:43:46,972 --> 01:43:49,055
<i>Lum-dee-lum-dee-la</i>

1621
01:43:49,431 --> 01:43:51,554
<i>Lum-dee-lum-dee-la</i>

1622
01:43:52,056 --> 01:43:54,387
<i>Lum-dee-lum-dee-la</i>

1623
01:43:54,764 --> 01:43:56,804
<i>Lum-dee-lum-dee-la</i>

1624
01:43:57,180 --> 01:43:58,762
<i>Lum-dee-lum-dee-la</i>

1625
01:43:58,929 --> 01:44:02,595
<i>Oh, monkey see, monkey do</i>

1626
01:44:19,678 --> 01:44:20,843
Virgin.

1627
01:44:22,219 --> 01:44:23,260
Virgin.

1628
01:44:40,468 --> 01:44:41,966
Teresa, you all right?

1629
01:44:42,134 --> 01:44:43,425
Yeah.

1630
01:44:44,092 --> 01:44:45,924
I'm sorry.

1631
01:44:47,134 --> 01:44:49,090
I told you I'm sorry.

1632
01:44:51,258 --> 01:44:53,715
- He's in trouble.
- What do you mean? What's going on?

1633
01:44:53,883 --> 01:44:55,631
Look, Teresa, just trouble, all right?

1634
01:44:55,799 --> 01:44:58,882
We gotta leave, until I get a chance
to talk to a couple of people.

1635
01:44:59,424 --> 01:45:01,715
I need a couple of bucks
to get to Greenwood Lake.

1636
01:45:01,883 --> 01:45:03,756
- Where are you going?
- To Greenwood Lake.

1637
01:45:03,923 --> 01:45:06,256
- I'm coming with you.
- No, you're not.

1638
01:45:06,424 --> 01:45:08,422
You want more trouble?
I'm coming with you.

1639
01:45:08,798 --> 01:45:10,714
Teresa, I got no time for this.

1640
01:45:10,882 --> 01:45:13,422
- So, what happened?
- Forget it.

1641
01:45:13,798 --> 01:45:16,921
I really think we should talk to
your uncle. That's the only way.

1642
01:45:17,089 --> 01:45:18,504
No.

1643
01:45:19,131 --> 01:45:22,005
- What happened? - It's all right,
Teresa. Will you forget it?

1644
01:45:22,172 --> 01:45:24,296
What are you gonna do,
hide me or what?

1645
01:45:24,464 --> 01:45:25,920
That's right.

1646
01:45:30,921 --> 01:45:34,587
I guess you could safely say
that things haven't gone so well tonight.

1647
01:45:35,421 --> 01:45:37,919
But I'm trying. Lord, I'm trying.

1648
01:45:40,920 --> 01:45:43,045
What are you, talking to yourself?

1649
01:45:57,711 --> 01:45:59,418
- Turn on the radio.
- Make it louder.

1650
01:45:59,586 --> 01:46:02,251
Oh, yeah, go ahead.
Turn on the radio, John. Yeah.

1651
01:46:02,418 --> 01:46:04,417
We're going to a party.
How about some fun?

1652
01:46:04,585 --> 01:46:06,208
Where are you going? To Brooklyn?

1653
01:46:06,376 --> 01:46:08,250
Why don't you make it louder? Go ahead.

1654
01:46:08,418 --> 01:46:10,542
- Where are we going?
- Seriously, do you know?

1655
01:46:10,709 --> 01:46:13,416
Where are we going?
You don't know where you're going.

1656
01:46:13,584 --> 01:46:15,916
We don't know Brooklyn. What's this?

1657
01:46:20,916 --> 01:46:22,874
- You know Brooklyn?
- Is this the right way?

1658
01:46:23,042 --> 01:46:25,082
Do I know Brooklyn?
Do I know the jungle?

1659
01:46:35,333 --> 01:46:36,706
Bing-bing.

1660
01:46:40,707 --> 01:46:43,039
- Watch...
- Ha, ha, ha.

1661
01:46:43,206 --> 01:46:45,456
- Watch where you're going!
- You're crazy.

1662
01:46:45,622 --> 01:46:48,330
You're out of your mind.
Didn't you see that light?

1663
01:46:48,497 --> 01:46:50,538
The light was red, right?

1664
01:46:51,372 --> 01:46:53,871
- Slow down. Will you slow down?
- What does red mean?

1665
01:46:54,039 --> 01:46:55,996
I wish you'd slow down
your mouth a little.

1666
01:47:01,621 --> 01:47:04,454
- What is that guy, crazy?
- Hey! Hey, jerk!

1667
01:47:04,621 --> 01:47:06,412
Now's the time.

1668
01:47:15,245 --> 01:47:16,411
Get down!

1669
01:47:22,745 --> 01:47:23,744
Johnny!

1670
01:47:23,995 --> 01:47:25,118
Johnny!

1671
01:47:34,869 --> 01:47:35,909
Get down!

1672
01:47:36,076 --> 01:47:37,617
- Get down!
- Argh!

1673
01:47:37,909 --> 01:47:39,242
Johnny!
