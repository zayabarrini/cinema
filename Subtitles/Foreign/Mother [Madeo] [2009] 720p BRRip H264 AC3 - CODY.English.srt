1
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:37,007
MOTHER

2
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,045
At ease!

3
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:16,588
Salute!

4
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:24,054
Do-joon!

5
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,765
Hey, Benz! You asshole!

6
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:29,893
Do-joon, are you okay?

7
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,353
Oh no, blood!

8
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:33,272
Oh no, blood!
Do-joon, you're bleeding!

9
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:36,775
Shit, mom, get back in the store!

10
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:39,778
You're bleeding!

11
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:45,492
He's bleeding!

12
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:49,579
I knew it!
This is your own blood!

13
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:52,791
To the golf course.
Royal Palace Country Club!

14
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:54,167
Did they go there?

15
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:55,335
You idiot,

16
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:58,171
Where else in this town
would a Benz be going?

17
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:01,174
Is this hit-and-run?

18
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:04,803
Bastards who slam on the gas
after hitting someone

19
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:06,596
deserve to have
their faces slammed.

20
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,098
Look!

21
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:11,810
- I'm bleeding!
- All right, All right.

22
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:15,272
Plate number 5362...
White Benz...

23
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:19,484
It's 5293, idiot.
A black Benz, fuck.

24
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:22,487
Ah, a black Benz, black...

25
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:25,782
How could you mix up...

26
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:27,367
It could happen.

27
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:30,245
For you, it could...
That head of yours is special.

28
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:34,791
Oh, there it is!

29
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:51,266
That must've hurt.

30
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:57,981
Come on, stupid.

31
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:16,458
Enough, it's not a surgery.

32
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:19,378
What are you, a doctor?

33
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:23,298
Wait, don't move your finger.
What are you doing?

34
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:27,427
This is driving me crazy.

35
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:30,055
Where the heck has he gone?

36
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:33,600
It's a golf course.

37
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:37,062
Right. It's a golf course.

38
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:41,191
But you don't remember
why we came, do you?

39
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:42,442
Yay!

40
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:48,281
Twelve ofthem!

41
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:53,703
What does she see in you anyway?

42
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,455
Your mom?

43
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,167
Right, mom...

44
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:01,878
The car... Vroom.

45
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:03,171
Crash!

46
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:05,090
My blood!

47
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:09,886
This is revenge.

48
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:12,806
Right, we're here for revenge.

49
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:16,893
Anyway,

50
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:19,604
Where the fuck are
these Benz assholes?

51
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,606
They should have passed by now.

52
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:26,820
Wow, look!

53
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,991
What're you gonna do
with all those golf balls?

54
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:38,874
I'll give it to a girl.

55
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,711
You got someone to give it to?

56
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:45,255
Uh... Yeah.

57
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:47,090
You ever slept with a woman?

58
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:52,262
Idiot...

59
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:54,473
You with your pretty face.

60
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:56,183
I slept with a woman.

61
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:58,560
What woman?

62
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:00,896
Mom.

63
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:05,984
Where the fuck are they...

64
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:29,466
Come on!

65
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,800
They're here!

66
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,889
Revenge! Revenge!

67
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:02,999
What's that idiot doing?

68
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,711
What's with him?

69
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:09,214
Fucking assholes!

70
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:13,468
Stop the car! You!

71
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:15,637
What are you doing?

72
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:17,264
Who do you think you are?
What is this?

73
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:23,979
You shitheads!

74
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:28,817
Who was driving the car?
You hit-and-run bastards!

75
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:30,569
Who was driving? You?

76
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:38,994
What is this?

77
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:40,287
- What's gotten into you?
- Who was it?

78
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:41,913
Were you the one driving?

79
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:02,892
Excuse me.

80
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:05,979
This person is
too important to be here...

81
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:12,652
As I was saying, settlement
would be better for both of you.

82
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:16,281
After all, respected professors
such as yourselves

83
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:19,075
being involved in a hit-and-run...

84
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,786
And these two aren't
some kind of hustlers.

85
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:24,289
They're just local kids.

86
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:30,378
So we're going to settle, okay?

87
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:35,383
The hit-and-run and the assault

88
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:37,469
cancel each other out.

89
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:40,388
Do-joon
The verbal threats don't factor in.

90
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,475
Dean Kwon, the car...

91
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:47,395
They smashed my rearview mirror
in the parking lot.

92
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:49,481
A Mercedes Benz 280.

93
00:10:55,279 --> 00:11:00,158
Aw fuck, why the hell
did you smash their mirror?

94
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:03,912
That'll cost a lot.

95
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:05,580
You bet.

96
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:10,001
Damn... Why did I do that?

97
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:14,673
You know how much that cost,
you dumb retard?

98
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:18,468
Retard?

99
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:22,681
What are you doing?

100
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:28,478
Let go! Let me go!

101
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:29,729
That bastard,
who does he think he is?

102
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:30,980
Sit down, Mister.

103
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:38,571
The mirror on a Benz...
That would cost...

104
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:39,906
A lot.

105
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:43,201
$1500? $2000?

106
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:47,080
Ah, here she comes...

107
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:48,748
Good afternoon, sir.

108
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:04,264
Eat up.

109
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,642
Eat.

110
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:13,898
Always eat well after
coming back from the police station.

111
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,654
Fuck...

112
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:22,282
I can feed myself.

113
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:33,668
I boiled this
with deodeok root and gugija.

114
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,754
It's good for your virility.

115
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:38,548
Really? My virility?

116
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:41,676
Why are you
so concerned about that?

117
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:43,678
Women.

118
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:46,765
Are you seeing someone?

119
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:52,562
Sure. Gonna sleep with her.

120
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:53,855
Sleep with her?

121
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:55,273
Who is it?

122
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:58,860
Gonna sleep with a woman.

123
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:04,991
How could you do that to
that Benz-whatever?

124
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:07,368
That expensive mirror?

125
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:10,580
Smash! With my foot.

126
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:13,166
It was revenge!

127
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,751
Good boy.

128
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:17,837
But I've got no money.

129
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:21,591
Where will I dig that up?

130
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:24,177
Whose yard will I dig it up in?

131
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:27,472
Why dig it up?
Just borrow it from Jin-tae.

132
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:28,848
Jin-tae!

133
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:32,852
Stay away from him.
Rotten kid.

134
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:36,022
He's from bad seed.

135
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:39,984
Okay.

136
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,738
Where are you going?

137
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:45,198
To meet Jin-tae.

138
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:49,202
You should finish dinner.

139
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:52,580
Have some medicine then.
You shouldn't skip medicine.

140
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,670
Do-joon, you didn't finish this.

141
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:42,797
Come home early!

142
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:45,383
Don't be late.

143
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:21,961
It doesn't hurt, right?

144
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:24,964
No, it's fine.

145
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:30,303
This won't hurt,
and I won't charge you for it.

146
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:32,597
So can you lend me some money?

147
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,600
How much?

148
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:37,852
It's really urgent.

149
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:41,105
And I'll give you medicine
instead of interest.

150
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:43,858
- Medicine?
- Yes!

151
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:45,985
To make you pregnant,

152
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:48,196
guaranteed effective.

153
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:49,989
Is there such a thing?

154
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:52,283
It really works.

155
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:56,371
I took some, and then
I got pregnant with Do-joon.

156
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,749
Your son will be
just as good-looking.

157
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,584
Do-joon...

158
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:04,671
His eyes are a work of art.

159
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:06,214
Like a deer's.

160
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:08,758
- Like mine?
- Yeah.

161
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,219
They're just like yours.

162
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:12,971
They're beautiful.

163
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,766
Anyway,

164
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:20,687
you're looking sexier these days...

165
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:23,314
- I mean...
- Yeah, whatever.

166
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,024
Why hasn't Jin-tae shown up?

167
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:28,861
He's not?

168
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:30,863
He should be here by now.

169
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:35,785
You've been saying that for hours.

170
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:38,496
Don't mess with me.

171
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:43,501
I just came back
from the police station.

172
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:45,670
Have some respect.

173
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:56,806
Jin-tae, where the hell are you?
Hurry up!

174
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:04,063
Go to bed, mom!

175
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:09,777
I'm staying up late.
I told you to go to sleep.

176
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,583
Good shot!

177
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:34,552
Hey, wake up.

178
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,305
Wake up!

179
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:41,476
Do something about him.

180
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:56,491
Did you have a nice sleep?

181
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,786
Wipe the spit off your face.

182
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:03,998
Goddamn freak,
piss off and go to hell.

183
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:08,586
Call your mom and tell her
to come pay the bill!

184
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:09,754
This is driving me crazy.

185
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,464
Do-joon!

186
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,466
Hey, I told you
to use the backstairs.

187
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:16,886
- Mina!
- How have you been?

188
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:21,474
Yeah, you wanna
have a drink with me?

189
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,767
Really?

190
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:27,605
- Turn around and march!
- Call me.

191
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:29,482
Okay, I'm going.

192
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:32,610
Shut up
and go do your homework.

193
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:35,154
That skirt is pretty.

194
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:37,782
You! Turn around!

195
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:39,659
Her legs are prettier.

196
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,786
Get your eyes off her!

197
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,788
Get out of here!

198
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:44,956
BAR MANHATTAN

199
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,960
Please fuck off, okay?

200
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:50,294
Wait...

201
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,965
To pay for the drinks...

202
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:56,884
Expensive ones...

203
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:32,795
Hey!

204
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:36,507
Where are you going?

205
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:41,804
How about you and me...

206
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:43,264
have a drink?

207
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:47,685
With a guy... Don't want to?

208
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:53,983
You don't like guys?

209
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:24,782
So late...

210
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:09,994
What was her name, Ah-jung?

211
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:12,997
It's Moon Ah-Jung.

212
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:16,167
Seorin Girls' High School,
second year, fourth class.

213
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:19,170
You called her house?
She has guardians?

214
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:22,381
There's a grandmother,

215
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:24,800
but she's a real loon.

216
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:28,095
Always walking around with
a rice liquor bottle in her fist,

217
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,513
making a scene.

218
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:31,432
So the kid is the guardian.

219
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:34,852
She takes care of her grandma.

220
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:43,694
Anyway, how long has it been
since we had a murder case?

221
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:50,284
It's the first since I came here.

222
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:53,704
Has it been that long?

223
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:54,872
Yep.

224
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:03,297
The crime scene seems intact.

225
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:04,673
It is.

226
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:06,258
Quite a picture, huh?

227
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:08,886
Cops these days...

228
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:11,347
You know, CSI and all that on TV.

229
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:13,599
They all watch it.

230
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:16,060
The forensics team
is pretty sharp, too.

231
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:18,270
Anyway,
a rain shower passed earlier.

232
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:21,774
So things must be
pretty mucked up.

233
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:23,692
I suppose.

234
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:28,072
Anyway, it must have been
a blunt object.

235
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:30,908
A fractured cranium,
lots of blood...

236
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:45,172
What's with this?

237
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:47,091
Didn't this come in last week?

238
00:23:50,887 --> 00:23:52,179
God, that smell...

239
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:54,181
Yeah, well...

240
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,267
This smells like a rotting corpse.

241
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:58,602
My god!

242
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:00,896
Look at this if you're not blind.

243
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:03,274
And the appearance...

244
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:07,278
People are going to think
they're from China.

245
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:09,280
Ma'am, these are from China.

246
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:10,489
Hey!

247
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:13,701
Give me a break.
Don't even mention China.

248
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:16,454
Besides, Chinese imports
aren't that bad.

249
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:18,873
Don't tell me...

250
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:21,375
You're still giving acupuncture
without a license?

251
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:26,380
No, no way!

252
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:27,882
My husband is a public official.

253
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:29,175
You know how much trouble
we'll be in?

254
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:31,260
Sure, I know.

255
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:32,970
He'll be promoted soon,

256
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:35,723
so let's not cause any trouble.

257
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:40,978
Last year, do you know how hard
it was to cover for you?

258
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:43,814
You think only you will
get in trouble?

259
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:46,442
It will ruin my family completely.

260
00:24:46,526 --> 00:24:48,694
Listen when someone's
talking to you.

261
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:49,862
Mom!

262
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:59,455
Do-joon! Do-joon!

263
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:03,792
Mom!

264
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:06,378
Get down!

265
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:08,464
Oh geez...

266
00:25:08,548 --> 00:25:11,467
She's a good runner.

267
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:57,471
Yoon Do-joon, you're charged with
the murder of Moon Ah-jung.

268
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:00,891
You have the right to remain silent

269
00:26:01,184 --> 00:26:04,812
but there's no way
you'll be able to afford a lawyer.

270
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,481
There she is.

271
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:08,983
Not that she can
afford to do anything.

272
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:13,195
Can't you drive, idiot?

273
00:26:14,197 --> 00:26:15,906
Are you hurt anywhere?

274
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:18,200
Turn your head.
Your head isn't hurt?

275
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:20,661
Turn your head around.

276
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:24,957
Why is he...

277
00:26:30,463 --> 00:26:31,964
- A dog?
- Dog...

278
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:34,091
- A wolf?
- Dog...

279
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:36,969
It's usually hot here.

280
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:40,097
We're all guys here,
so take that off.

281
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:41,890
Your pants too, okay?

282
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:44,268
- Pants?
- Take off your pants, it's okay.

283
00:26:45,895 --> 00:26:49,815
This isn't police torture.

284
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:53,110
I'm taking my pants offtoo.
It feels good.

285
00:26:55,280 --> 00:27:00,159
Anyway Do-joon,
Have you heard of Sepaktakraw?

286
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:03,370
- You have, right?
- No.

287
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:07,374
Only likes mainstream sports,
the fucker.

288
00:27:09,085 --> 00:27:10,085
Bite it!

289
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:14,673
Come here and bite it.

290
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,888
That's right, turn around.

291
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:22,181
The sin always turns around.

292
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:25,893
Stand straight. Close your eyes.

293
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:28,687
Don't move or you'll get hurt.
Bite it hard!

294
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:31,649
Did you see it?

295
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:33,150
I bet not.

296
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:37,738
This is power of Sepaktakraw.

297
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:41,450
It's one ofthe basic moves.

298
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:48,165
From now on, if you don't
answer clearly yes or no,

299
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:51,293
I'll kill you right here.

300
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:53,754
I'll be watching you.

301
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:55,756
Do-joon,

302
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:58,175
what did you do last night?

303
00:27:58,301 --> 00:27:59,593
Hey, spit out the apple.

304
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:03,013
What did you do?

305
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:04,640
I had a drink...

306
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:05,974
Where?

307
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:09,728
- Manhattan.
- That's right. And then?

308
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:12,481
I slept at home.

309
00:28:12,732 --> 00:28:14,066
You slept, of course.

310
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:17,903
But before that, I mean...

311
00:28:17,987 --> 00:28:20,739
At home, no,
after drinking at Manhattan

312
00:28:20,907 --> 00:28:24,201
on your way home,
what did you do?

313
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:26,578
The lady at Manhattan said

314
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:29,498
you were like a dog in heat.

315
00:28:29,582 --> 00:28:31,208
Her daughter, what's her name?

316
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:34,086
- Mina.
- Right. Mina.

317
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:36,672
You were hitting on her?

318
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:39,967
Well, I...

319
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:41,885
Answer clearly!

320
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:44,471
I slept at home. With mom.

321
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:50,978
- That's simple.
- You sleep with your mom?

322
00:28:56,776 --> 00:28:58,986
You don't have to answer.

323
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:01,905
Anyway,
you say you don't remember

324
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:05,576
but everyone remembers you.

325
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:08,662
There was a guy who saw you
while feeding his dog.

326
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:12,458
You were following
after Moon Ah-jung.

327
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:14,376
Heading towards
the scene ofthe murder.

328
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:16,754
Isn't that right?

329
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:21,467
I don't remember...

330
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:24,011
You wanna
die here right now, punk?

331
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:26,013
We've got plenty of apples.

332
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:28,474
- Open your mouth.
- Never mind that.

333
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:30,559
You know,

334
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:33,395
we also found something

335
00:29:34,689 --> 00:29:38,025
next to the body.

336
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:44,656
Why didn't you put up
a marker next to the body?

337
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:47,576
With your name written right on it.

338
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:50,662
- Don't laugh.
- Do-joon,

339
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:53,081
Just between us...

340
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,083
Why did you do it?

341
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:59,004
On personal level,
I'm really curious.

342
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:05,385
So did you want to do it
with Moon Ah-jung?

343
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:14,853
We need to know why,
then the judge can be lenient.

344
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:18,190
Maybe we can
do something for you.

345
00:30:18,566 --> 00:30:21,652
He's asking this
for your own benefit.

346
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:24,363
Do-joon.

347
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:27,366
To be honest,

348
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:30,869
you're not the kind of person
to commit murder.

349
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:33,372
Not everyone
is able to kill someone.

350
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:36,667
You've never been a bad kid.

351
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:39,211
I can be bad.

352
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:45,509
Jesus...

353
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:51,265
Right, anyone can commit murder.

354
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:53,767
It's not like you need a license.

355
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:58,564
Anyway,
you don't know the motive,

356
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:03,569
but you killed her, right?

357
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:09,575
The fact that you killed her,
that's what's important.

358
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:12,494
He confessed.

359
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:18,125
Anyway, this document contains
all the details ofthe case, see?

360
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:21,128
Check it over.

361
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:25,090
But you can read, right?

362
00:31:25,174 --> 00:31:26,758
Want me to read it for you?

363
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:27,676
I can read.

364
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:33,557
Sure, anyway, don'tjust sign it
without reading it.

365
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:36,268
Check the contents, and sign.

366
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:37,936
Read it well.

367
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:41,857
Why did you do it!

368
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:44,484
How could you do that?

369
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:47,195
They hit you?

370
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:51,700
The cops beat you, didn't they?

371
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:58,290
Where did they hit you?

372
00:31:58,458 --> 00:31:59,750
An apple...

373
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,837
Apple

374
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:15,390
Do-joon,

375
00:32:16,392 --> 00:32:18,852
at times like this,
you need to focus your mind.

376
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:22,689
Focus. Take a deep breath.

377
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:31,198
Do-joon...

378
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:34,034
Everyone says I killed her.

379
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:35,869
Breathe like me.

380
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:37,871
And so...

381
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:41,375
the sin turns around
a few times

382
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:44,211
- and comes back to me.
- What are you mumbling about?

383
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:47,381
Did you really sign
that confession?

384
00:32:49,592 --> 00:32:51,969
Why? Why? Why?

385
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:55,681
Even if you really did it,
you have to deny it.

386
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:58,225
If I killed her, I should admit it.

387
00:32:58,309 --> 00:32:59,476
Did you kill her?

388
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:01,895
Are you crazy? Of course not.

389
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,689
Then why did you sign it, idiot!

390
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:05,941
Don't call your son an idiot!

391
00:33:24,585 --> 00:33:25,669
Je-mun,

392
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:28,296
How could you
of all people do this to him?

393
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:29,589
You know him,

394
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:32,676
he couldn't even hurt a water bug.

395
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:39,850
A water bug...

396
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:44,771
Wipe off your face first.

397
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:01,496
Je-mun,

398
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:06,877
here's some ofthe camphor ginseng
you used to take in high school.

399
00:34:06,961 --> 00:34:11,840
You said it helped you think clearly.

400
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:14,843
- Take it.
- Listen.

401
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:17,763
From early morning,

402
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:19,556
I'm going to be up dealing

403
00:34:19,682 --> 00:34:21,683
with the Juhwang county
robbery case.

404
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,685
And... that crazy kid JP ran away

405
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:26,313
from the sanatorium
on Mt. Dogye.

406
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:29,566
I gotta go there and then...

407
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:33,695
I know, I know
how busy you are, but...

408
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:36,406
What I mean is...

409
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:44,081
regarding Do-joon,

410
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:50,128
his case is closed, okay?

411
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:55,383
Do you understand?

412
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:02,682
It's finished, 100%.

413
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:15,779
Bastard,
you sure were having fun.

414
00:35:18,574 --> 00:35:20,784
I left early, you ass.

415
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:27,666
Excuse me, people. Step aside.

416
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:43,056
What the hell are you doing?

417
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:45,976
What's inside this thing anyway?

418
00:35:59,782 --> 00:36:02,868
Put it down there.

419
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,495
Turn it over.

420
00:36:05,955 --> 00:36:07,789
What in god's name
are you doing?

421
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:13,420
Are you kidding me?

422
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:15,964
Turn the damn thing over.

423
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:20,093
Mister, don't touch it!

424
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:23,096
Actually I'm not a relative,

425
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:24,097
but I'm close to them.

426
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:25,390
Sir!

427
00:36:27,768 --> 00:36:31,062
Ifthere's a reason
you believe he's not guilty, tell us.

428
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:34,983
If you read through this here,
you see this golf ball?

429
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:37,569
The golf ball has
already been reported.

430
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:40,155
What's this?
'Apple-biting human rights abuses'?

431
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:45,869
Mister, please read it
before throwing it away.

432
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:49,414
Read it carefully first,
then throw it away.

433
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,083
It's my only son.

434
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:29,079
Is she crazy?

435
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,958
Why is that woman here?

436
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:35,043
Who?

437
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:36,878
Yoon Do-joon's mother...

438
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:41,591
No...

439
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:44,678
How the hell could you?

440
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:46,346
Are you out of your mind?

441
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:48,682
I'm just...

442
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:53,687
As a member ofthis community
I wanted to pay my respects.

443
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:58,775
You came to apologize?
For your son?

444
00:37:58,901 --> 00:38:00,527
Does that make sense?

445
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:11,329
Actually, my son didn't do it.

446
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:18,795
Listen everyone,
regardless what the world may think,

447
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:21,506
you of all people
must understand!

448
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:23,883
It wasn't my son!

449
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:29,264
She's completely insane!

450
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:30,515
Hey bitch!

451
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:32,600
How could you
bring your ugly face here?

452
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:33,977
Throw some salt at her!

453
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:36,604
I just wanted to tell you
that my son is innocent.

454
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:37,605
Stop it!

455
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:38,773
What do you mean he's innocent?

456
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:40,692
It was your son, Yoon Do-joon!

457
00:38:40,776 --> 00:38:42,777
- The murderer!
- Bring back our Ah-jung!

458
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:43,987
Bring her back to us!

459
00:38:44,071 --> 00:38:45,864
Let's talk civilly!

460
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:51,369
Bring Ah-jung back to life!

461
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:54,372
- It's a misunderstanding!
- Misunderstanding my ass!

462
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:59,085
Let go!

463
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,378
What's there to discuss?

464
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:04,007
How could she dare?

465
00:39:05,384 --> 00:39:07,177
Shut up you fuckers!

466
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:10,013
What's this god damn racket?
Fucking bitches.

467
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:14,267
How could you
raise such a rotten son?

468
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:15,977
That goddamn son of a bitch!

469
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:21,441
Don't curse my son.
I won't stand for it!

470
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,986
Rip that bitch's tongue out!

471
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:26,863
Don't hate him!

472
00:39:26,989 --> 00:39:28,156
I won't...

473
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:28,258
This place has the best seafood.

474
00:40:28,342 --> 00:40:30,802
You know everything, don't you?

475
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:32,595
It's true.

476
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:35,598
Shall we sit down here?

477
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:38,601
When I come to a buffet,
I never sit down.

478
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:39,811
Don't run!

479
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:43,982
I just keep scooping it up
and eating it.

480
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:46,818
Yes of course,
because you're so busy.

481
00:40:46,902 --> 00:40:48,611
I save time that way.

482
00:40:49,905 --> 00:40:53,950
This is the lawyer, Gong Suk-ho.

483
00:40:54,076 --> 00:40:55,952
Say hello to him.

484
00:40:58,372 --> 00:40:59,706
Do-joon,

485
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:02,459
Tuck your shirt in.

486
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:07,172
That side, too.

487
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:09,716
It looks better this way.

488
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,176
Does it?

489
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:16,181
Are you getting
along well enough here?

490
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:17,390
Yes,

491
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:19,976
the food is good.

492
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:22,729
The rice with beans
is better than I thought.

493
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:26,691
Rice with beans?
That's what prisoners eat.

494
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:29,068
Do-joon!

495
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:34,157
The most important thing is
what you remember that night.

496
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:39,996
However small a detail,
just tell him what you can think of.

497
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,789
You understand?

498
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:43,708
What you saw, what you heard,

499
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:47,378
even what you smelled,
tell him everything in detail.

500
00:41:47,713 --> 00:41:51,174
Anyway, you need to try
really hard to remember.

501
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:54,385
That's your only task in here.

502
00:41:56,388 --> 00:41:57,555
Isn't that right?

503
00:41:58,891 --> 00:41:59,891
Right.

504
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:03,895
Yes, do this.

505
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:08,274
Is this some kind of exercise?

506
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:12,695
No, we call it
the Temples of Doom.

507
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:15,281
From childhood,
whenever he does this

508
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:16,991
it helped him remember.

509
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:19,202
- So for memory?
- Yes, for memory.

510
00:42:19,286 --> 00:42:21,579
Yes, it's some kind of,
what do you call it...

511
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:23,289
acupressure.

512
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:27,794
Oh, I remember!

513
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:29,462
What?

514
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:32,799
I didn't do it.

515
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:34,801
It wasn't me!

516
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:37,971
That's right!
Of course you didn't kill her.

517
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:39,472
No,

518
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:42,475
not that.

519
00:42:43,352 --> 00:42:46,563
I didn't kick it off, the mirror!

520
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:52,485
On the Benz... Jin-tae...

521
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:56,990
It was Jin-tae who did it.

522
00:42:57,825 --> 00:43:01,828
I went whoosh!
And he went crunch!

523
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:04,872
Sir.

524
00:43:05,457 --> 00:43:06,541
Let me explain.

525
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:08,960
What he is saying is...
It's a long story.

526
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:10,169
Wait!

527
00:43:22,182 --> 00:43:24,976
I just got an urgent message
from the office.

528
00:43:25,644 --> 00:43:26,811
I need to go.

529
00:43:26,895 --> 00:43:28,479
Then what about us?

530
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:31,566
For a first meeting,
this is enough.

531
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:34,277
- Should I Call you?
- I'll call you.

532
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:38,781
Then when will you call?

533
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:40,283
Sir...

534
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
What?

535
00:43:49,668 --> 00:43:53,671
Did he leave?
He doesn't like us, does he?

536
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:55,006
He's a very busy man.

537
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:58,176
The most expensive lawyer
in our county.

538
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:00,678
Damn, wasn't there
anything else to tell him?

539
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:02,096
I should have said more.

540
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:05,183
Right, who cares about
the mirror?

541
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:08,394
But, you mean
it was Jin-tae who did it?

542
00:44:10,564 --> 00:44:13,149
I knew it.

543
00:44:13,275 --> 00:44:16,361
That rotten little scoundrel.

544
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:18,446
Thatjerk never came
to visit me even once.

545
00:44:22,451 --> 00:44:24,077
But Do-joon,

546
00:44:24,578 --> 00:44:29,290
that night, didn't you go out
to meet Jin-tae?

547
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:32,460
Then you never met him.

548
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:37,006
And the golf balls,

549
00:44:37,299 --> 00:44:41,094
he knew about those, right?

550
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:59,278
Good afternoon.
I've come to see Attorney Gong.

551
00:44:59,905 --> 00:45:01,989
He's not in now.

552
00:45:02,574 --> 00:45:04,742
His car is outside.

553
00:45:05,494 --> 00:45:07,495
He's really not here.

554
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:09,372
He is, isn't he?

555
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:11,582
Oh, Mr. Gong! Excuse me!

556
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:13,084
Oh, look who's here!

557
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:14,919
- Sir, I...
- Yes?

558
00:45:15,003 --> 00:45:17,755
- Miss Kim, some green tea!
- What I'd like to say is...

559
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:21,551
If he's here, why can't I...

560
00:45:21,635 --> 00:45:23,761
Ma'am,
would you prefer coffee?

561
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:27,640
To be honest,
about your case,

562
00:45:27,766 --> 00:45:32,895
we are proceeding
slowly and methodically.

563
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:33,980
Here, have some.

564
00:45:34,106 --> 00:45:37,567
I understand you feel impatient.

565
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:39,652
But what can we do?

566
00:45:39,778 --> 00:45:41,988
You just need to wait patiently.

567
00:45:42,114 --> 00:45:46,909
But we need to open an investigation
on Do-joon's friend, Jin-tae!

568
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:49,287
Ma'am!

569
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:52,081
Let me be honest with you.

570
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:55,084
In monetary terms,

571
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:56,377
ifthis were Seoul,

572
00:45:56,462 --> 00:45:58,379
the fee we're charging

573
00:45:58,464 --> 00:46:01,758
wouldn't cover an assault case
involving two broken teeth.

574
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:07,096
You should understand that.

575
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:21,277
This is Jin-tae's house.

576
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:25,656
I'm out right now,
so leave me a message.

577
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:29,744
If you are interested
in fishing equipment or bait

578
00:46:29,828 --> 00:46:35,833
You can call me at
010-31 54-1406.

579
00:47:51,785 --> 00:47:53,369
Son of a bitch.

580
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:03,880
Files on Scientific Investigation

581
00:49:12,741 --> 00:49:14,283
Blood...

582
00:50:07,796 --> 00:50:08,796
Stop.

583
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:16,387
I said stop.

584
00:50:16,805 --> 00:50:18,764
Let me look at this first.

585
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:20,182
Let me take this offfirst.

586
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:25,062
- Cooperate a little.
- Just a sec.

587
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:26,856
Okay, okay.

588
00:50:27,941 --> 00:50:30,192
There you go.

589
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:34,196
Shit, this is the climax.

590
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:25,748
Spa-ghet-ti!

591
00:51:28,043 --> 00:51:29,293
Ti-ra-mi-su!

592
00:51:31,671 --> 00:51:32,588
Tsu-na-mi!

593
00:51:32,672 --> 00:51:33,672
Mi-ner-al!

594
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:34,757
Al-arm!

595
00:51:35,383 --> 00:51:36,759
Arm-a-dil-lo!

596
00:54:46,074 --> 00:54:47,574
Where's Je-mun?

597
00:54:49,244 --> 00:54:51,495
- Detective Nam Je-mun.
- What's the problem?

598
00:54:51,579 --> 00:54:52,663
Out of my way.

599
00:55:01,589 --> 00:55:03,257
Push this.

600
00:55:05,176 --> 00:55:06,885
It's not yours, right?

601
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:08,345
Yes!

602
00:55:09,806 --> 00:55:10,681
Do I look pretty?

603
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:11,807
She put way too much on.

604
00:55:11,891 --> 00:55:15,602
Isn't that...
the Manhattan lady's daughter?

605
00:55:20,066 --> 00:55:22,860
Is this what you do together?

606
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:26,864
Lucky bastard.

607
00:55:30,493 --> 00:55:33,370
Watch this part, here.

608
00:55:34,247 --> 00:55:37,875
That's what it is, lipstick?

609
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:40,586
But do you play golf?

610
00:55:41,379 --> 00:55:42,379
Me, golf?

611
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:45,883
Those professors
gave it to me when they left.

612
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:47,509
Excuse me. Sir?

613
00:55:49,262 --> 00:55:52,264
Do we really have to call
the forensics team?

614
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:56,977
Anyone can tell
this is just lipstick.

615
00:55:57,437 --> 00:56:00,356
All right,
tell them not to bother.

616
00:56:23,171 --> 00:56:24,171
Wait!

617
00:56:24,964 --> 00:56:30,761
Take an umbrella.

618
00:57:10,802 --> 00:57:11,885
Wait a minute.

619
00:57:48,548 --> 00:57:51,175
I went to pick you up
at the station.

620
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:55,721
Please get in.
Attorney Gong wants to see you.

621
00:58:05,982 --> 00:58:08,525
Welcome, ma'am.

622
00:58:09,152 --> 00:58:12,696
We started without you.

623
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:14,698
You, wait outside.

624
00:58:15,366 --> 00:58:18,869
Have a seat.

625
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:22,789
You've had quite a day today.

626
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:26,168
I heard it from the police chief.

627
00:58:26,711 --> 00:58:29,546
I feel so sad for you.

628
00:58:32,008 --> 00:58:34,176
It's the first time I've seen
you sitting down.

629
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:38,680
Ah, you have a fine wit.

630
00:58:40,683 --> 00:58:41,892
Pass her a drink.

631
00:58:44,979 --> 00:58:48,565
Ma'am, do you remember
the 2002 World Cup?

632
00:58:49,275 --> 00:58:51,068
The Red Devils,

633
00:58:51,194 --> 00:58:52,694
Gus Hiddink!

634
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:57,991
Four years passed in a flash

635
00:58:58,451 --> 00:59:01,703
I could still feel
the excitement of 2002.

636
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:04,081
But then suddenly
it was 2006.

637
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:07,918
The Germany World Cup!

638
00:59:08,586 --> 00:59:11,630
Four years
is no time at all, I mean.

639
00:59:12,465 --> 00:59:14,967
I really don't understand
what you're saying.

640
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:17,344
Regarding Do-joon,

641
00:59:18,471 --> 00:59:20,973
let's send him off
forjust four years.

642
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:26,061
It'll be a hospital, not a jail,

643
00:59:26,646 --> 00:59:29,565
and he won't
have to serve 15 years.

644
00:59:33,278 --> 00:59:34,278
Ma'am!

645
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:37,281
We need to think realistically.

646
00:59:37,365 --> 00:59:42,494
Four years in a mental institution
for this case is a legal jackpot!

647
00:59:49,377 --> 00:59:50,460
Music!

648
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:58,093
Ma'am.
I forgot to introduce you.

649
00:59:58,886 --> 01:00:04,266
To my right,
my high school classmate,

650
01:00:04,392 --> 01:00:06,810
the president of
Agape Psychiatric Hospital,

651
01:00:06,894 --> 01:00:09,479
Doctor Yoon Jong-gu!

652
01:00:11,274 --> 01:00:13,567
Hey, wake him up?

653
01:00:14,485 --> 01:00:16,570
And next to me

654
01:00:16,654 --> 01:00:19,990
my bar exam classmate,

655
01:00:20,074 --> 01:00:22,659
Attorney Park Jong-pyo!

656
01:00:24,370 --> 01:00:25,537
He's handsome.

657
01:00:25,663 --> 01:00:27,873
What? Are you holding a protest?

658
01:00:28,166 --> 01:00:30,876
He's smashed
afterjust a few drinks.

659
01:00:31,002 --> 01:00:32,169
Mr. Gong!

660
01:00:35,089 --> 01:00:38,091
Look, my son is...

661
01:01:55,002 --> 01:01:56,211
Do-joon!

662
01:02:04,470 --> 01:02:05,762
Why are you so late?

663
01:02:10,476 --> 01:02:12,185
You've been drinking, haven't you?

664
01:02:12,979 --> 01:02:14,771
It's so late...

665
01:02:15,273 --> 01:02:16,398
Did you eat?

666
01:02:20,194 --> 01:02:21,194
Eat?

667
01:02:21,988 --> 01:02:24,781
I was wondering if you ate.

668
01:02:26,117 --> 01:02:27,784
Thanks so much for asking.

669
01:02:28,286 --> 01:02:31,121
Anyway,
I feel so fucking betrayed.

670
01:02:31,164 --> 01:02:32,831
How could you
do this to me, bitch!

671
01:02:35,835 --> 01:02:39,463
Jin-tae, I did a terrible thing.

672
01:02:41,090 --> 01:02:42,257
Forget that.

673
01:02:43,009 --> 01:02:45,260
Just pay me $5000
as a settlement.

674
01:02:46,095 --> 01:02:47,262
In cash.

675
01:02:48,681 --> 01:02:51,475
All I have right now...

676
01:02:51,851 --> 01:02:54,019
it's not much...

677
01:02:54,687 --> 01:02:56,021
Wait...

678
01:02:56,105 --> 01:03:05,572
I've been saving this
to pay back my debt.

679
01:03:05,656 --> 01:03:07,365
Take this for now.

680
01:03:15,583 --> 01:03:16,833
Okay.

681
01:03:19,462 --> 01:03:22,005
Send the rest to my bank account.

682
01:03:22,089 --> 01:03:24,090
I'll text you the account number.

683
01:03:26,302 --> 01:03:27,385
You know what texting is?

684
01:03:39,857 --> 01:03:42,734
Wait. By the way,

685
01:03:44,278 --> 01:03:46,571
that dead girl, Moon Ah-jung.

686
01:03:48,282 --> 01:03:49,866
Do you know anything about her?

687
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:56,748
Actually there were
rumors about her from way back.

688
01:03:58,584 --> 01:04:02,379
It's not nice to talk
this way about the dead,

689
01:04:05,508 --> 01:04:07,884
but rumors are rumors.

690
01:04:10,012 --> 01:04:11,096
Look,

691
01:04:11,556 --> 01:04:14,266
there are only three motives
for murder.

692
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:18,478
Money, passion,
and vengeance.

693
01:04:19,272 --> 01:04:21,940
Try to think this through.

694
01:04:22,108 --> 01:04:26,111
That poor kid living on the hill,
what kind of money could she have?

695
01:04:27,113 --> 01:04:28,780
So it must be

696
01:04:28,865 --> 01:04:33,368
either passion or vengeance.

697
01:04:34,579 --> 01:04:36,204
So we need to start

698
01:04:36,289 --> 01:04:38,373
by investigating
the people around her.

699
01:04:41,377 --> 01:04:42,794
But those fuckers
on the police force

700
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:45,088
found that golf ball

701
01:04:45,172 --> 01:04:47,465
and just close the case?

702
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:48,925
Exactly.

703
01:04:50,553 --> 01:04:53,763
Do-joon is the
obvious scapegoat for them.

704
01:04:55,474 --> 01:04:57,934
If it were me,
I'd never investigate like that.

705
01:04:59,395 --> 01:05:01,938
Sorry, I didn't know
you thought that way.

706
01:05:05,401 --> 01:05:09,279
Of course. Do-joon has been
totally fucked over.

707
01:05:09,947 --> 01:05:11,781
I'm his friend after all.

708
01:05:12,575 --> 01:05:15,785
Thank you, Jin-tae.

709
01:05:17,413 --> 01:05:20,290
Don't cry!
This is no time to cry.

710
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:22,584
Quit it!

711
01:05:30,593 --> 01:05:31,760
Anyway,

712
01:05:34,972 --> 01:05:37,098
Do you know
what the strangest thing is?

713
01:05:42,855 --> 01:05:43,855
The roof.

714
01:05:46,609 --> 01:05:50,195
The body was left on the roof.
That dead girl.

715
01:05:52,448 --> 01:05:54,282
Usually you bury a dead body.

716
01:05:55,034 --> 01:05:57,202
But in this case,
it was hoisted up.

717
01:05:59,288 --> 01:06:02,207
Her body was
practically put out on display.

718
01:06:03,376 --> 01:06:04,751
Like hanging out laundry.

719
01:06:08,297 --> 01:06:10,048
'Look, everyone,

720
01:06:11,384 --> 01:06:14,594
I murdered this fucking bitch.

721
01:06:15,596 --> 01:06:17,222
Do you see the corpse?'

722
01:06:19,308 --> 01:06:22,310
That sort ofthing...

723
01:06:55,302 --> 01:06:56,594
Look.

724
01:06:57,388 --> 01:07:01,266
If you put the body there,
the whole town can see it.

725
01:07:02,184 --> 01:07:04,936
Anyway this neighborhood
is pretty strange.

726
01:07:05,771 --> 01:07:06,855
So my point is...

727
01:07:08,065 --> 01:07:09,774
Don't trust anyone.

728
01:07:10,776 --> 01:07:12,193
You don't need them.

729
01:07:13,070 --> 01:07:14,404
Don't even trust me.

730
01:07:16,866 --> 01:07:19,284
You go out and find the real killer.

731
01:07:40,306 --> 01:07:41,389
Do-joon,

732
01:07:42,558 --> 01:07:45,685
you're trying hard to remember
that night, right?

733
01:07:51,317 --> 01:07:53,860
If you recall
or remember something,

734
01:07:53,986 --> 01:07:56,571
be sure to tell just me.

735
01:07:57,323 --> 01:08:01,076
Only to me.
Do you understand?

736
01:08:01,577 --> 01:08:04,579
What about that lawyer?

737
01:08:05,748 --> 01:08:07,749
I fired him.

738
01:08:13,672 --> 01:08:17,759
You printed the memorial photo
for Moon Ah-jung, right?

739
01:08:24,683 --> 01:08:27,143
She's a real pretty girl.

740
01:08:27,311 --> 01:08:29,896
That's why
'pretty girls have no luck.'

741
01:08:29,980 --> 01:08:31,481
Isn't it 'pretty girls die young?'

742
01:08:31,607 --> 01:08:34,150
That's why she left us early.

743
01:08:34,318 --> 01:08:36,778
That girl, her mother died early

744
01:08:36,904 --> 01:08:39,280
and her father ran off
with another woman.

745
01:08:39,365 --> 01:08:41,574
Her relatives are
a bunch of bitches too.

746
01:08:41,659 --> 01:08:44,285
That young thing got
by all on her own.

747
01:08:44,578 --> 01:08:46,287
She must have been
lonely as hell.

748
01:08:46,372 --> 01:08:47,288
Who're you talking about?

749
01:08:47,581 --> 01:08:50,041
Ah-jung.
They say she had a boyfriend.

750
01:08:50,167 --> 01:08:51,167
Who?

751
01:08:51,293 --> 01:08:52,502
Crazy JP.

752
01:08:52,878 --> 01:08:53,962
Crazy JP from the sanatorium?

753
01:08:54,046 --> 01:08:56,172
No fucking way.

754
01:08:56,298 --> 01:08:58,508
Crazy JP is ugly as hell.

755
01:08:58,592 --> 01:09:02,303
It's true.
Ah-jung really liked boys.

756
01:09:02,388 --> 01:09:03,680
They say she couldn't
even take a nap by herself.

757
01:09:03,806 --> 01:09:05,682
Those are all lies.

758
01:09:05,808 --> 01:09:07,892
Ah-jung's nickname
was Rice Cake Girl.

759
01:09:08,686 --> 01:09:10,061
Rice Cake?

760
01:09:10,187 --> 01:09:11,855
Did she eat lots of rice cake?

761
01:09:11,939 --> 01:09:13,481
I bet she ate fish cake too.

762
01:09:14,859 --> 01:09:18,653
Isn't there anything else
you kids remember about her?

763
01:09:19,572 --> 01:09:22,407
I remember
seeing her from the back.

764
01:09:24,076 --> 01:09:25,410
She wore a backpack.

765
01:09:25,870 --> 01:09:27,162
White calves.

766
01:09:28,497 --> 01:09:30,790
Are you sure she was alone?

767
01:09:30,875 --> 01:09:32,167
There was nobody else?

768
01:09:39,425 --> 01:09:42,177
From Manhattan up to that place,

769
01:09:42,261 --> 01:09:45,054
you saw no one else?

770
01:09:45,764 --> 01:09:46,973
You see him?

771
01:09:48,225 --> 01:09:51,144
Go over and call him retard.

772
01:09:51,228 --> 01:09:52,228
And then what?

773
01:09:53,147 --> 01:09:56,232
It's fucking hilarious.

774
01:09:58,569 --> 01:09:59,986
You gotta try it.

775
01:10:00,779 --> 01:10:02,697
You guarantee me
this will be funny?

776
01:10:02,781 --> 01:10:04,407
Just try.

777
01:10:08,412 --> 01:10:09,495
Retard!

778
01:10:18,255 --> 01:10:19,464
Hey retard!

779
01:10:24,762 --> 01:10:27,680
What the fuck,
I feel like an idiot.

780
01:10:28,599 --> 01:10:30,892
Here he comes!

781
01:10:31,769 --> 01:10:33,895
How could you do that?

782
01:10:33,979 --> 01:10:35,271
Why would you fight...

783
01:10:35,773 --> 01:10:37,774
I told you to meditate.

784
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:39,984
That's what I was doing.
Shoot...

785
01:10:40,694 --> 01:10:42,779
Quiet down.

786
01:10:42,905 --> 01:10:44,781
You don't know anything, mom.

787
01:10:45,616 --> 01:10:47,492
Sure, your mom
doesn't know anything.

788
01:10:47,618 --> 01:10:48,910
What would I know?

789
01:10:49,703 --> 01:10:52,038
Why don't you just keep quiet?

790
01:10:54,041 --> 01:10:57,585
You told me if anyone insults me,
I should kick their ass.

791
01:10:58,587 --> 01:11:00,255
Sure, ifthey insult you...

792
01:11:00,339 --> 01:11:01,256
Kick their ass.

793
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:02,340
Ifthey hit you once...

794
01:11:03,884 --> 01:11:05,051
Hit back twice.

795
01:11:05,886 --> 01:11:08,972
What about your poor body?

796
01:11:09,056 --> 01:11:10,765
Did you take your medicine?

797
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:12,892
Did they give you some?

798
01:11:14,353 --> 01:11:15,687
But you know,

799
01:11:17,898 --> 01:11:19,357
it's amazing.

800
01:11:19,692 --> 01:11:20,692
What?

801
01:11:23,529 --> 01:11:25,863
After I got beaten, I remembered.

802
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:27,782
The memories came back.

803
01:11:28,867 --> 01:11:30,576
You remembered something?

804
01:11:38,585 --> 01:11:39,877
Something important.

805
01:11:40,254 --> 01:11:41,254
Then what is it?

806
01:11:42,589 --> 01:11:45,091
That you tried to kill me.

807
01:11:50,097 --> 01:11:51,806
When I was five, right?

808
01:11:53,892 --> 01:11:58,354
You gave me a Bacchus bottle
with insecticide in it.

809
01:12:07,865 --> 01:12:09,240
Do-joon!

810
01:12:09,867 --> 01:12:11,367
Are you okay?

811
01:12:11,493 --> 01:12:13,786
Shit, this is embarrassing.

812
01:12:13,871 --> 01:12:14,871
What?

813
01:12:15,164 --> 01:12:16,873
There are lots of people here.

814
01:12:16,999 --> 01:12:19,584
How could you remember?

815
01:12:20,252 --> 01:12:21,794
It's true.

816
01:12:22,504 --> 01:12:24,589
You tried to get rid of me.

817
01:12:24,715 --> 01:12:26,007
How could you say that?

818
01:12:26,091 --> 01:12:29,594
I was so desperate...
I was going to kill both of us.

819
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:31,763
But you made me drink it first.
The insecticide drink.

820
01:12:31,847 --> 01:12:33,598
Will you shut up?

821
01:12:36,268 --> 01:12:39,979
You had to be first,
so that I could follow.

822
01:12:40,064 --> 01:12:41,689
Let's step outside.

823
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:45,610
I was so desperate then.

824
01:12:45,694 --> 01:12:47,278
You and me are one.

825
01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:49,697
We've only got each other.

826
01:12:49,782 --> 01:12:51,866
Hey, get over here quick!

827
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:55,870
How could a five-year-old
remember something like that?

828
01:12:57,164 --> 01:12:59,290
Ma'am, please stop this.

829
01:12:59,708 --> 01:13:01,167
Let me give you acupuncture.

830
01:13:03,295 --> 01:13:05,171
There's a meridian point

831
01:13:05,255 --> 01:13:07,757
that can loosen the knots
in your heart

832
01:13:07,883 --> 01:13:10,176
and clear all horrible memories
from your mind.

833
01:13:11,428 --> 01:13:12,762
Let me see your thigh.

834
01:13:13,347 --> 01:13:15,348
I'm the only one
who knows this point.

835
01:13:15,682 --> 01:13:19,602
Up your thigh to the partition.
5 inches from here and 3 1/2 again.

836
01:13:19,686 --> 01:13:21,270
Ma'am!

837
01:13:23,899 --> 01:13:25,441
Jong-do,

838
01:13:25,984 --> 01:13:28,444
you can see that he's sick inside.

839
01:13:29,196 --> 01:13:31,197
Please let me do it.

840
01:13:32,199 --> 01:13:33,199
Why,

841
01:13:35,994 --> 01:13:37,954
this time you gonna kill me
with your needles?

842
01:13:39,957 --> 01:13:43,167
What are you doing?
Hurry up and get him out!

843
01:13:47,172 --> 01:13:49,173
Don't ever come again, mom.

844
01:13:49,675 --> 01:13:51,259
I won't see you.

845
01:15:19,431 --> 01:15:20,681
This photo...

846
01:15:21,058 --> 01:15:24,685
Can you enlarge it
and print it out clearly?

847
01:15:33,987 --> 01:15:37,698
I should've
used Gramoxon back then.

848
01:15:37,991 --> 01:15:42,703
If I had, we'd be frolicking
in heaven's flower garden right now,

849
01:15:42,996 --> 01:15:44,580
instead of suffering.

850
01:15:45,916 --> 01:15:47,917
I didn't have the heart,
so I used Lone Star.

851
01:15:48,001 --> 01:15:49,377
That's a weaker brand.

852
01:15:50,003 --> 01:15:53,965
So instead of dying, we spent
two days vomiting and shitting water.

853
01:15:56,051 --> 01:16:00,972
After that, I fed him
all the good stuff in the world...

854
01:16:04,059 --> 01:16:07,061
He was the cutest then.

855
01:16:07,646 --> 01:16:09,272
Though he's still cute now.

856
01:16:10,899 --> 01:16:14,652
Yeah, in this photo
he's cute as a button.

857
01:16:15,195 --> 01:16:17,196
It makes you want to
have a baby, huh?

858
01:16:17,489 --> 01:16:18,489
Yeah.

859
01:16:18,824 --> 01:16:21,826
You will soon. You're taking
the medicine I gave you?

860
01:16:21,910 --> 01:16:23,077
Sure.

861
01:16:23,996 --> 01:16:25,538
This thing is amazing.

862
01:16:27,082 --> 01:16:29,875
There's nothing
you can't do these days.

863
01:16:31,253 --> 01:16:33,462
This is nothing, just the basics.

864
01:16:36,967 --> 01:16:39,385
Just the basics...

865
01:16:42,973 --> 01:16:46,559
This works great.
It's completely gone.

866
01:16:46,643 --> 01:16:48,185
This is nothing, just the basics.

867
01:16:48,562 --> 01:16:50,271
It came out well.

868
01:16:50,647 --> 01:16:51,897
Do you like it?

869
01:16:52,649 --> 01:16:54,900
I wish this would work in the mirror.

870
01:16:56,403 --> 01:16:57,820
By the way,

871
01:16:57,863 --> 01:17:01,073
how much would it cost

872
01:17:01,158 --> 01:17:05,369
to print about
twenty cell phone pictures?

873
01:17:05,996 --> 01:17:07,288
Not sure.

874
01:17:07,873 --> 01:17:10,374
But why would you
want to print those anyway?

875
01:17:10,459 --> 01:17:12,668
The quality won't be very good.

876
01:17:14,296 --> 01:17:15,796
Well,

877
01:17:16,465 --> 01:17:18,090
it's just a memento.

878
01:17:25,807 --> 01:17:27,183
Shit.

879
01:17:27,893 --> 01:17:29,310
Here's a tissue.

880
01:17:32,564 --> 01:17:36,067
This happens
to you like every day.

881
01:17:37,736 --> 01:17:39,570
Why don't you go see a doctor?

882
01:17:39,905 --> 01:17:41,739
It's too expensive.

883
01:17:42,908 --> 01:17:44,075
Right,

884
01:17:44,576 --> 01:17:47,745
the one with the nosebleed
was Ah-Jung.

885
01:17:47,913 --> 01:17:50,289
But why cell phone photos?

886
01:17:51,583 --> 01:17:53,167
The photos...

887
01:17:55,379 --> 01:17:57,296
are pretty awesome.

888
01:17:58,298 --> 01:17:59,298
Ma'am,

889
01:18:00,759 --> 01:18:04,178
You've got plenty of rice,
and the water works.

890
01:18:04,554 --> 01:18:08,557
And you have rice liquor, I see.
Do you have a cell phone?

891
01:18:08,892 --> 01:18:11,477
Why? You wanna buy me one?

892
01:18:13,271 --> 01:18:15,356
Or even better,
just give me the money.

893
01:18:15,732 --> 01:18:17,983
Your land line is dead,
that's why.

894
01:18:18,652 --> 01:18:20,736
Who knows, ask Ah-jung.

895
01:18:20,904 --> 01:18:24,198
That bitch left home
and hasn't come back.

896
01:19:12,748 --> 01:19:16,751
Wow, the poop is spinning.

897
01:19:18,253 --> 01:19:20,838
Where can I get that done?

898
01:19:21,673 --> 01:19:23,382
I made it myself.

899
01:19:23,467 --> 01:19:25,092
Really?

900
01:19:25,177 --> 01:19:29,555
I like that kind ofthing too.
I want one. Like this.

901
01:19:31,850 --> 01:19:34,018
That model is kind oftoo old.

902
01:19:35,479 --> 01:19:38,397
She's really good at that.
She makes pervert phones too.

903
01:19:38,482 --> 01:19:41,025
- If you pay her.
- Shut up.

904
01:19:42,569 --> 01:19:44,195
Earn lots of cash, bye.

905
01:19:44,279 --> 01:19:46,280
What's a pervert phone?

906
01:19:47,157 --> 01:19:52,077
When cellphones take pictures,
they always make a sound.

907
01:19:52,162 --> 01:19:54,163
Cheese, ding!

908
01:19:54,664 --> 01:19:56,290
I just tweak it
to remove the sound.

909
01:19:56,374 --> 01:19:58,000
For hidden cameras.

910
01:19:58,585 --> 01:20:01,754
I'd like that
even more than the poop.

911
01:20:03,590 --> 01:20:08,594
You're a master.
Where did you learn all this?

912
01:20:09,387 --> 01:20:13,182
It's just a hobby
and part-time job.

913
01:20:22,275 --> 01:20:24,985
Did you do this for
that poor girl Ah-jung?

914
01:20:27,864 --> 01:20:30,366
You know where
her cell phone is, don't you?

915
01:20:30,492 --> 01:20:31,659
Ma'am.

916
01:20:34,204 --> 01:20:37,373
Do you have it?

917
01:20:37,499 --> 01:20:38,666
What?

918
01:20:40,502 --> 01:20:41,669
A menstrual pad.

919
01:20:43,088 --> 01:20:45,756
I haven't used one in ages.

920
01:20:47,092 --> 01:20:50,094
There's a store across the street.

921
01:20:50,387 --> 01:20:52,346
Could you go buy me some?

922
01:20:52,931 --> 01:20:55,099
I'm so sorry.

923
01:20:55,183 --> 01:20:57,935
Why'd this happen all of a sudden?
It's not time yet.

924
01:21:01,481 --> 01:21:04,775
Don't go anywhere, okay?

925
01:21:31,553 --> 01:21:33,387
- I know you have it, bitch.
- I don't.

926
01:21:33,471 --> 01:21:37,850
Hey! Ifwe find it on you,
you're dead meat.

927
01:21:37,934 --> 01:21:39,560
Fuck, I'm gonna search you.

928
01:21:40,687 --> 01:21:41,937
Look in her bag.

929
01:21:42,105 --> 01:21:44,690
Ifwe find it,
we're gonna rip your head off.

930
01:21:44,774 --> 01:21:47,693
I know you have it bitch.
Where did you stash it?

931
01:21:47,777 --> 01:21:49,278
I really don't have it.

932
01:21:51,489 --> 01:21:53,699
You were the only friend she had.

933
01:21:53,783 --> 01:21:54,950
Tell me now.

934
01:21:55,577 --> 01:21:58,829
We're busy guys, okay?

935
01:21:59,289 --> 01:22:01,957
So answer us
before we get mean.

936
01:22:02,083 --> 01:22:04,668
I don't know, assholes!

937
01:22:07,172 --> 01:22:08,464
Cute.

938
01:22:08,590 --> 01:22:12,843
You know,
your face looks unbalanced.

939
01:22:13,845 --> 01:22:16,680
You can use a little symmetry,

940
01:22:17,098 --> 01:22:18,098
couldn't you?

941
01:22:18,475 --> 01:22:20,851
Spilling blood over
a stupid cell phone.

942
01:22:20,977 --> 01:22:23,854
Where's Ah-jung's phone,
you fucking bitch!

943
01:22:23,980 --> 01:22:24,980
Tell us, you slut!

944
01:22:32,656 --> 01:22:35,741
Who's this fooling around
in my workplace?

945
01:22:35,867 --> 01:22:38,452
What the fuck are you doing here?

946
01:22:38,578 --> 01:22:40,579
I said what are you doing, fuckers!

947
01:22:40,664 --> 01:22:43,374
Answer me! Get out of here!

948
01:22:44,042 --> 01:22:45,668
Hey, push me.

949
01:22:45,961 --> 01:22:48,379
Stop! Stop!

950
01:22:52,592 --> 01:22:55,052
If I see you back here,
you're dead!

951
01:22:58,306 --> 01:23:01,308
Yeah, so where are you now?

952
01:23:03,061 --> 01:23:04,770
I need your help.

953
01:23:05,021 --> 01:23:07,356
Can you come over here now?

954
01:23:09,192 --> 01:23:10,651
Yeah, now.

955
01:23:56,865 --> 01:23:59,700
Who are these little shits?

956
01:24:00,076 --> 01:24:00,951
Let go of me.

957
01:24:01,077 --> 01:24:03,078
And who the fuck are you?

958
01:24:03,204 --> 01:24:05,789
You in your stupid fucking hat?

959
01:24:05,874 --> 01:24:06,957
You shithead.

960
01:24:07,876 --> 01:24:10,210
Why are you looking for
Ah-jung's cell phone?

961
01:24:21,848 --> 01:24:23,974
Were you one of
her boyfriends, too?

962
01:24:31,858 --> 01:24:33,692
Rice Cake Girl, for sure.

963
01:24:33,777 --> 01:24:34,777
Rice Cake?

964
01:24:35,403 --> 01:24:37,404
Don't you know that?

965
01:24:37,572 --> 01:24:39,865
Give her rice and fuck her.

966
01:24:40,492 --> 01:24:43,327
Have your cake,
and eat it, too.

967
01:24:43,411 --> 01:24:47,122
Ah-jung, you poor thing...

968
01:24:47,290 --> 01:24:48,457
I know things are hard, but still...

969
01:24:48,583 --> 01:24:51,877
How could you
take rice instead of cash?

970
01:24:51,961 --> 01:24:55,756
Fuck! Ifthe Schoolgirl Pussy
for Money Union finds out,

971
01:24:55,882 --> 01:24:57,132
I'll get expelled!

972
01:24:57,300 --> 01:24:58,592
If you take rice one more time,
you're dead.

973
01:24:58,676 --> 01:25:02,054
Cut it Out, dude. Fuck it all.

974
01:25:02,138 --> 01:25:04,681
You're the bastard
who paid her in rice!

975
01:25:04,766 --> 01:25:07,309
Get out! That was crazy JP
who stole rice

976
01:25:07,393 --> 01:25:09,144
- from the sanatorium.
- Fuck off, asshole!

977
01:25:09,312 --> 01:25:10,771
It's true!

978
01:25:10,897 --> 01:25:13,899
Pretty Ah-jung had
turned all cold,

979
01:25:13,983 --> 01:25:16,151
and you kept insisting.

980
01:25:29,290 --> 01:25:30,958
Ma'am, listen to this.

981
01:25:32,877 --> 01:25:34,503
It's in my blood.

982
01:25:34,587 --> 01:25:37,172
I should have been a fuckin' cop.

983
01:25:38,883 --> 01:25:40,801
Moon Ah-jung's cell-phone...

984
01:25:41,886 --> 01:25:46,807
Ifthose pictures ever get out,
lots of guys will suffer.

985
01:25:49,060 --> 01:25:51,937
That phone is an atomic bomb.

986
01:25:52,772 --> 01:25:56,650
She photographed them all
with her pervert phone,

987
01:25:57,235 --> 01:25:58,777
those guys she fucked.

988
01:25:59,070 --> 01:26:01,572
It must be
two soccer teams or more.

989
01:26:03,408 --> 01:26:04,658
So,

990
01:26:04,784 --> 01:26:06,493
were you on the soccer team too?

991
01:26:06,578 --> 01:26:09,413
How could you say that?

992
01:26:10,081 --> 01:26:13,667
But I was actually
quite close to her,

993
01:26:13,793 --> 01:26:14,960
in a spiritual way.

994
01:26:16,588 --> 01:26:19,089
Back then I asked her.

995
01:26:19,591 --> 01:26:20,799
Hey Ah-jung,

996
01:26:21,593 --> 01:26:24,553
did you really take pictures
of all those guys?

997
01:26:25,388 --> 01:26:28,557
Sure I did.

998
01:26:28,850 --> 01:26:30,559
Hey, am I in there too?

999
01:26:31,561 --> 01:26:34,229
Why? Are you scared?

1000
01:26:35,690 --> 01:26:37,858
You think I'll blackmail you?

1001
01:26:38,568 --> 01:26:42,154
Give me a break.
Me scared of you?

1002
01:26:45,575 --> 01:26:46,783
I'm sick of it...

1003
01:26:49,162 --> 01:26:50,162
What?

1004
01:26:50,997 --> 01:26:52,164
Sick of cocks?

1005
01:26:55,585 --> 01:26:57,586
I hate all this.

1006
01:26:59,964 --> 01:27:02,382
I should throw
this damn phone away.

1007
01:27:04,135 --> 01:27:06,970
A perfectly good phone?

1008
01:27:07,972 --> 01:27:10,474
Just delete the photos!

1009
01:27:13,686 --> 01:27:15,145
I don't want to.

1010
01:27:23,488 --> 01:27:26,990
I'm sure
he's there among the photos.

1011
01:27:27,075 --> 01:27:28,784
The guy who killed her.

1012
01:27:30,495 --> 01:27:32,579
But that idiot Yoon Do-joon

1013
01:27:32,664 --> 01:27:34,331
sure got fucked over.

1014
01:27:38,169 --> 01:27:40,045
Yeah, that retard

1015
01:27:40,171 --> 01:27:43,757
never even saw her panties,
and then he gets blamed.

1016
01:27:44,884 --> 01:27:45,759
That's enough.

1017
01:27:45,885 --> 01:27:48,345
Hey, I heard that
Do-joon sleeps with his mom?

1018
01:27:48,513 --> 01:27:49,346
I said shut up!

1019
01:27:49,514 --> 01:27:52,599
Does he just sleep?
Or does he fuck her?

1020
01:28:22,255 --> 01:28:23,255
What the hell?

1021
01:28:24,090 --> 01:28:26,508
Who are you?

1022
01:28:33,099 --> 01:28:35,600
Wait, don't move.

1023
01:28:51,159 --> 01:28:52,242
Tell me.

1024
01:28:53,077 --> 01:28:57,080
Is that really all you know
about the cell phone?

1025
01:28:58,374 --> 01:29:01,585
Not again...

1026
01:29:01,711 --> 01:29:07,507
Why don't you all leave me alone
for Christ's sake!

1027
01:29:12,055 --> 01:29:13,680
Well...

1028
01:29:14,849 --> 01:29:19,978
I remember
her saying something...

1029
01:29:20,063 --> 01:29:21,688
Like...

1030
01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:26,151
If I traded this cell phone
for rice liquor,

1031
01:29:26,277 --> 01:29:27,986
how many bottles would I get?

1032
01:29:28,988 --> 01:29:30,781
What, are you drinking
rice liquor now too?

1033
01:30:04,690 --> 01:30:06,066
Mom!

1034
01:30:06,692 --> 01:30:12,364
Mom! Visit!

1035
01:30:12,698 --> 01:30:14,449
I remember! I remember!

1036
01:30:14,617 --> 01:30:17,702
Mom! Call mom!

1037
01:30:19,163 --> 01:30:20,330
Mom!

1038
01:30:20,873 --> 01:30:22,874
Granny!

1039
01:30:27,588 --> 01:30:29,589
Are you home?

1040
01:30:35,805 --> 01:30:59,953
Granny!

1041
01:31:05,376 --> 01:31:07,252
Ah-jung sent you!

1042
01:31:12,884 --> 01:31:13,967
The money?

1043
01:31:29,275 --> 01:31:31,776
Is that it?

1044
01:31:32,778 --> 01:31:34,362
Is that all she sent?

1045
01:31:36,282 --> 01:31:40,160
By the way,
where's Ah-jung's cell phone?

1046
01:31:41,704 --> 01:31:42,704
The phone?

1047
01:31:43,998 --> 01:31:51,379
I already traded it for rice liquor.

1048
01:31:53,382 --> 01:31:55,300
You're lying.

1049
01:31:56,886 --> 01:32:00,430
Ah-jung told me
to be sure to bring it back.

1050
01:32:03,184 --> 01:32:05,769
That crazy tramp
keeps taking it back.

1051
01:33:15,631 --> 01:33:17,090
Look closely.

1052
01:33:20,553 --> 01:33:23,805
No, no...

1053
01:33:27,101 --> 01:33:28,560
He had white hair,

1054
01:33:29,812 --> 01:33:30,979
an old man.

1055
01:33:55,671 --> 01:33:58,006
I've seen this man before.

1056
01:35:04,990 --> 01:35:05,990
Hello?

1057
01:35:48,117 --> 01:35:49,659
Is anyone home?

1058
01:35:57,376 --> 01:35:58,543
Who are you?

1059
01:35:59,545 --> 01:36:01,171
Do you see me?

1060
01:36:02,757 --> 01:36:04,466
Have a seat.

1061
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:08,553
But why have you come
to a place like this?

1062
01:36:08,679 --> 01:36:13,850
I'm from a volunteer organization
called Hyeminwon.

1063
01:36:14,560 --> 01:36:18,396
We provide free medical checks
for elderly people living alone.

1064
01:36:18,481 --> 01:36:20,273
For free?

1065
01:36:21,692 --> 01:36:24,402
We also provide
free acupuncture...

1066
01:36:24,987 --> 01:36:27,071
All sorts ofthings.

1067
01:36:28,741 --> 01:36:30,658
I've heard ofthem, Hyeminwon.

1068
01:36:31,285 --> 01:36:33,745
Since you're here,
let's have a chat.

1069
01:36:34,997 --> 01:36:37,290
It's cold.

1070
01:36:42,838 --> 01:36:44,380
I've seen you before.

1071
01:36:44,840 --> 01:36:46,174
I don't think so.

1072
01:36:48,385 --> 01:36:49,761
Maybe not.

1073
01:36:50,763 --> 01:36:52,764
Anyway stay awhile
now that you're here.

1074
01:36:53,474 --> 01:36:57,977
- You can sleep over if you want.
- You're quite a joker.

1075
01:36:58,062 --> 01:37:00,855
Are you sick anywhere?

1076
01:37:01,565 --> 01:37:03,650
No place in particular.

1077
01:37:03,734 --> 01:37:06,736
But my heart's
not so good these days.

1078
01:37:07,738 --> 01:37:09,364
Your heart?

1079
01:37:09,740 --> 01:37:14,369
Actually not long ago,
I saw something I shouldn't have.

1080
01:37:14,495 --> 01:37:17,372
At my age it was a shock.

1081
01:37:17,665 --> 01:37:20,375
I felt it in my whole body.

1082
01:37:20,501 --> 01:37:22,001
It's good that I came.

1083
01:37:22,086 --> 01:37:23,503
There's a meridian point

1084
01:37:23,587 --> 01:37:26,589
that can loosen the knots
in your heart

1085
01:37:26,674 --> 01:37:30,385
and clear all horrible memories
from your mind.

1086
01:37:30,511 --> 01:37:31,553
On the thigh...

1087
01:37:31,929 --> 01:37:34,848
Oh, should I take off my pants?

1088
01:37:34,932 --> 01:37:38,476
Just a minute.
I need to prepare first.

1089
01:37:41,188 --> 01:37:42,188
Anyway,

1090
01:37:43,190 --> 01:37:45,859
what did you see,
a traffic accident?

1091
01:37:47,361 --> 01:37:49,487
You're curious, aren't you?

1092
01:37:50,197 --> 01:37:56,369
I haven't told a soul about this.

1093
01:37:57,204 --> 01:38:00,790
Tell me.
I'll make sure it doesn't hurt.

1094
01:38:01,959 --> 01:38:05,378
You remember that incident
in this town a while back?

1095
01:38:05,671 --> 01:38:07,171
The murder case.

1096
01:38:08,465 --> 01:38:11,467
When that young girl was killed.

1097
01:38:13,262 --> 01:38:17,390
The house where it took place
had been abandoned for a long time.

1098
01:38:19,184 --> 01:38:23,855
I happened to be there that night.

1099
01:38:28,944 --> 01:38:31,195
Careful, it's hot.

1100
01:38:32,781 --> 01:38:37,285
Actually, I sometimes go there.

1101
01:38:37,828 --> 01:38:40,371
It's quiet there,
being empty and all.

1102
01:38:42,666 --> 01:38:46,753
But that night, that girl came in.

1103
01:38:48,839 --> 01:38:50,965
And behind her,

1104
01:38:51,091 --> 01:38:54,093
some strange guy
was following her...

1105
01:38:54,178 --> 01:39:07,774
You don't like guys?

1106
01:39:30,381 --> 01:39:31,381
Hey!

1107
01:39:35,386 --> 01:39:36,678
Do you know me?

1108
01:39:37,972 --> 01:39:39,222
No...

1109
01:39:39,765 --> 01:39:41,391
I said, do you know me?

1110
01:39:44,228 --> 01:39:45,186
Nope.

1111
01:39:45,270 --> 01:39:46,479
Then why...

1112
01:39:49,191 --> 01:39:50,858
I hate guys.

1113
01:39:54,196 --> 01:39:57,031
So don't talk to me like that,
you stupid retard.

1114
01:41:02,556 --> 01:41:05,558
Shit!

1115
01:41:12,399 --> 01:41:13,399
Hey!

1116
01:41:16,153 --> 01:41:17,987
Why are you lying there?

1117
01:41:31,460 --> 01:41:35,755
Hey! Are you hurt?

1118
01:41:35,881 --> 01:41:36,881
No!

1119
01:41:36,965 --> 01:41:39,050
You must have seen it wrong!

1120
01:41:39,384 --> 01:41:40,676
What's gotten into you?

1121
01:41:40,761 --> 01:41:42,887
You must have seen it wrong.

1122
01:41:42,971 --> 01:41:46,682
They say Yoon Do-joon is innocent,
that he'll be released soon.

1123
01:41:46,767 --> 01:41:48,601
They're going to
re-open the investigation.

1124
01:41:48,685 --> 01:41:49,769
Really?

1125
01:41:50,312 --> 01:41:53,606
That's what the cops said.

1126
01:41:53,690 --> 01:41:55,316
That's nonsense!

1127
01:41:55,400 --> 01:41:58,152
I saw his face with my own eyes.

1128
01:41:58,654 --> 01:42:00,947
It was him for sure!
Yoon Do-joon.

1129
01:42:01,031 --> 01:42:03,282
He threw that rock

1130
01:42:04,576 --> 01:42:08,871
and he made
these weird movements.

1131
01:42:10,374 --> 01:42:13,167
How could they let him out now?

1132
01:42:13,502 --> 01:42:17,046
Anyway they caught the right guy.

1133
01:42:17,673 --> 01:42:21,300
I better call and report it myself.
Those idiots...

1134
01:42:25,597 --> 01:42:27,807
Where's the number?

1135
01:42:34,565 --> 01:42:35,773
No!

1136
01:42:36,650 --> 01:42:41,779
Never, no! No!

1137
01:42:43,490 --> 01:42:45,491
No way, you trash!

1138
01:42:53,667 --> 01:42:56,669
You're not even worth
the dirt on my son's toenail.

1139
01:43:33,707 --> 01:43:38,753
What do I do?

1140
01:43:38,879 --> 01:43:41,130
What do I do? Mom...

1141
01:51:35,188 --> 01:51:36,188
Ma'am!

1142
01:51:37,732 --> 01:51:39,191
We caught the killer.

1143
01:51:43,279 --> 01:51:44,571
Do you remember?

1144
01:51:45,073 --> 01:51:47,491
I think I mentioned it before.

1145
01:51:48,576 --> 01:51:50,994
JP, who ran away
from the sanatorium.

1146
01:51:51,496 --> 01:51:54,665
He was... Where was it?

1147
01:51:54,749 --> 01:51:56,583
- Mt. Dogye.
- That's right.

1148
01:51:56,668 --> 01:51:57,668
They caught him there.

1149
01:51:57,752 --> 01:52:00,379
Anyway, on his shirt,

1150
01:52:00,463 --> 01:52:03,549
they found some bloodstains.

1151
01:52:03,633 --> 01:52:07,386
They analyzed it
and it matched with Moon Ah-jung,

1152
01:52:07,470 --> 01:52:09,388
so it's game over.

1153
01:52:09,472 --> 01:52:13,267
A golf ball can't
compare to evidence like that.

1154
01:52:13,643 --> 01:52:18,105
Why did he do it?

1155
01:52:19,566 --> 01:52:22,484
Well, he's not
what you call normal.

1156
01:52:23,111 --> 01:52:27,573
It could have ended
in attempted rape, don't you think?

1157
01:52:27,657 --> 01:52:31,827
Sure. But according to him,

1158
01:52:32,245 --> 01:52:35,539
it was all because of love.

1159
01:52:35,665 --> 01:52:37,666
He says he's Ah-jung's boyfriend.

1160
01:52:38,460 --> 01:52:40,544
And the bloodstains,

1161
01:52:40,670 --> 01:52:44,089
he says the two ofthem
were going at it passionately

1162
01:52:44,174 --> 01:52:48,093
and then she got a nosebleed.

1163
01:52:48,178 --> 01:52:54,099
Wow, that kid
can think pretty fast.

1164
01:52:55,685 --> 01:52:56,852
But ma'am,

1165
01:52:57,687 --> 01:53:00,022
Do you really
need to go and see JP?

1166
01:53:33,848 --> 01:53:37,184
Do you have parents?

1167
01:53:47,487 --> 01:53:49,363
Have you got a mom?

1168
01:54:11,928 --> 01:54:13,345
Don't cry.

1169
01:54:17,934 --> 01:54:18,934
ma'am

1170
01:55:13,281 --> 01:55:14,573
Yoon Do-joon!

1171
01:55:20,371 --> 01:55:28,962
Happy release from jail.
Happy release from jail.

1172
01:55:29,756 --> 01:55:35,302
Happy being proven innocent,

1173
01:55:36,471 --> 01:55:41,308
happy release from jail.

1174
01:55:41,601 --> 01:55:43,602
Snap the picture.

1175
01:55:43,978 --> 01:55:44,978
Blow!

1176
01:55:46,481 --> 01:55:48,607
Ready, one, two,

1177
01:55:51,653 --> 01:55:53,946
- Congratulations!
- Here too.

1178
01:55:55,865 --> 01:55:57,658
When did you get this car?

1179
01:55:57,742 --> 01:55:59,576
I received some money recently.

1180
01:55:59,661 --> 01:56:01,870
Cool, huh? I ride it every day.

1181
01:56:02,872 --> 01:56:04,289
Does the tofu taste good?

1182
01:56:04,874 --> 01:56:05,958
Yeah.

1183
01:56:08,878 --> 01:56:11,463
What...

1184
01:56:11,756 --> 01:56:13,215
You didn't hear?

1185
01:56:13,466 --> 01:56:16,218
The junk collector's place
burned down.

1186
01:56:16,469 --> 01:56:19,221
They said he died.

1187
01:56:41,577 --> 01:56:43,036
Eat up.

1188
01:56:44,789 --> 01:56:46,498
Have some deodeok root, too.

1189
01:56:48,793 --> 01:56:52,587
What happened to the chestnuts?
I put in several.

1190
01:56:57,301 --> 01:56:58,385
Mom.

1191
01:57:00,680 --> 01:57:04,266
I've been... thinking.

1192
01:57:05,852 --> 01:57:07,060
About what?

1193
01:57:09,856 --> 01:57:11,773
That crazy JP,

1194
01:57:13,276 --> 01:57:15,861
why'd he put her body up
on the roof,

1195
01:57:16,487 --> 01:57:17,946
way up high?

1196
01:57:19,282 --> 01:57:21,575
Why think about that?

1197
01:57:28,958 --> 01:57:30,500
So I think,

1198
01:57:32,962 --> 01:57:34,838
maybe it was
so people would see her?

1199
01:57:37,550 --> 01:57:40,677
She was bleeding

1200
01:57:40,762 --> 01:57:42,763
she needed to go to the hospital.

1201
01:57:45,058 --> 01:57:49,770
So he put her in a place
where people could see her fast.

1202
01:57:54,067 --> 01:57:57,402
I bet that's it.

1203
01:58:35,399 --> 01:58:36,900
Attention, y'all.

1204
01:58:36,984 --> 01:58:42,280
Passengers on the
Thank-You-Parents Bus Tour,

1205
01:58:42,365 --> 01:58:46,660
Mom, take this on the bus to eat.

1206
01:58:46,786 --> 01:58:49,162
You didn't have to buy so much.

1207
01:58:49,288 --> 01:58:52,666
You can share it
with the other parents.

1208
01:58:52,792 --> 01:58:54,876
Don't leave it behind.

1209
01:58:58,589 --> 01:58:59,589
Oh, I forgot,

1210
01:59:01,050 --> 01:59:03,385
Mom. Here.

1211
01:59:03,511 --> 01:59:04,511
What?

1212
01:59:06,305 --> 01:59:07,514
I have something for you.

1213
01:59:07,598 --> 01:59:08,682
What is it?

1214
01:59:25,491 --> 01:59:31,496
Well... I found this at
the junk collector's burnt house.

1215
01:59:36,586 --> 01:59:41,673
How could you
leave this lying around?

1216
01:59:51,767 --> 01:59:53,143
Mom...

1217
02:00:14,081 --> 02:00:17,250
Hurry up!
