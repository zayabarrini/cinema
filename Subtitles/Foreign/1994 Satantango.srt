1
00:09:48,111 --> 00:09:52,027
<i>One October morning
before the first drops</i>

2
00:09:52,153 --> 00:10:00,236
<i>of the long autumn rains
fell on the parched soil,</i>

3
00:10:00,361 --> 00:10:08,611
<i>cutting the town off by
turning the roads to mud,</i>

4
00:10:08,736 --> 00:10:13,736
<i>Futaki was awakened
by the sound of bells.</i>

5
00:10:13,862 --> 00:10:20,196
<i>The solitary chapel was
eight kilometres away,</i>

6
00:10:20,321 --> 00:10:25,362
<i>and had no bell as even its tower
had collapsed during the war.</i>

7
00:10:25,487 --> 00:10:31,321
<i>And the town was too far away
to hear any noise from there.</i>

8
00:10:32,404 --> 00:10:41,697
News of Their Coming

9
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:22,458
What is it?

10
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:25,583
Nothing, just go back to sleep.

11
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:35,000
I'll pick up my share
and leave tonight.

12
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:53,125
Or tomorrow by the latest.

13
00:15:05,751 --> 00:15:08,168
Tomorrow morning.

14
00:16:30,423 --> 00:16:33,715
- You had a bad dream?
- Yes.

15
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:37,172
I was sitting in a room.

16
00:16:37,798 --> 00:16:41,381
Suddenly there was a
knock on the window.

17
00:16:42,256 --> 00:16:44,631
I didn't dare to open it.

18
00:16:44,756 --> 00:16:48,257
I peeked through the curtains.

19
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:53,132
I could only see his back, as he
was trying to get the door open.

20
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:58,382
And his mouth as he was shouting
something, I couldn't make out what.

21
00:16:59,507 --> 00:17:02,174
His face was unshaven.

22
00:17:03,174 --> 00:17:06,299
His eyes were like glass.

23
00:17:07,716 --> 00:17:11,424
I wanted to cry out,
but I had no voice.

24
00:17:12,925 --> 00:17:19,592
Then, Mrs Halics looked in
through the window, grinning...

25
00:17:19,716 --> 00:17:22,633
You know what she's
like when she grins.

26
00:17:24,467 --> 00:17:28,133
She was looking in, and
then she disappeared.

27
00:17:28,676 --> 00:17:34,051
The man kept kicking the door,
it was about to burst open.

28
00:17:35,926 --> 00:17:41,551
I rushed to the sideboard,
I wanted to open the drawer.

29
00:17:42,093 --> 00:17:45,552
Then I heard the door crashing in.

30
00:17:46,676 --> 00:17:49,926
Whoever he was, he was already
coming down the hallway.

31
00:17:51,009 --> 00:17:55,259
At last I yanked the drawer
open and got the knife out.

32
00:17:55,385 --> 00:17:57,552
And he was coming toward me.

33
00:17:57,677 --> 00:18:02,302
Suddenly he was lying
under the kitchen table,

34
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:06,760
surrounded by red
and blue saucepans,

35
00:18:06,885 --> 00:18:09,969
clanging and rolling around.

36
00:18:10,719 --> 00:18:14,511
And then the ground
moved under my feet.

37
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:19,178
The whole kitchen started to move,

38
00:18:19,678 --> 00:18:21,969
as if it were a car.

39
00:18:24,261 --> 00:18:26,761
I was awakened by bells.

40
00:18:26,886 --> 00:18:28,345
Where? Here?

41
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:32,179
They tolled twice.

42
00:18:33,096 --> 00:18:37,304
- We'll go mad in the end.
- No.

43
00:18:37,429 --> 00:18:41,262
I'm sure something is
going to happen today.

44
00:18:49,763 --> 00:18:52,680
It's my husband, I recognise him.

45
00:18:54,512 --> 00:18:56,805
Hurry.

46
00:19:04,305 --> 00:19:07,930
Listen, do exactly what I tell you.

47
00:19:08,972 --> 00:19:11,347
Is that clear?

48
00:19:12,972 --> 00:19:16,431
Start packing. Move!

49
00:19:18,431 --> 00:19:19,514
We're leaving tonight.

50
00:19:19,639 --> 00:19:26,431
Pack up our clothes, boots,
coats, the radio, everything.

51
00:19:26,556 --> 00:19:29,181
We got to disappear
from here tonight.

52
00:19:29,307 --> 00:19:31,639
You understand?

53
00:19:35,724 --> 00:19:38,099
- You got it?
- You're crazy.

54
00:19:38,224 --> 00:19:40,265
What are you saying?

55
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:43,890
I've talked to Kráner, we're
off with the money tonight.

56
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:48,058
If we split it eight ways,
we'll never get away from here.

57
00:19:48,183 --> 00:19:50,266
You think the others will
just go along with it?

58
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:53,765
Halics, the
schoolmaster and Futaki?

59
00:19:53,891 --> 00:19:58,640
I didn't work for a year
just to give it away now.

60
00:19:59,183 --> 00:20:00,933
They can go to hell.

61
00:20:01,058 --> 00:20:03,808
But it won't come to that.

62
00:20:03,933 --> 00:20:07,266
We can buy the farm
at last, don't you see?

63
00:20:07,391 --> 00:20:10,600
You're out of your
mind. You must be crazy.

64
00:20:10,726 --> 00:20:15,391
Start packing. The jerry-cans,
the lard, flour, bedding...

65
00:20:37,101 --> 00:20:39,560
I left my cane outside.

66
00:21:07,853 --> 00:21:09,894
Get out!

67
00:22:37,983 --> 00:22:40,773
Schmidt, are you in?

68
00:22:51,191 --> 00:22:54,025
You wanted to get away
with the money, isn't it?

69
00:22:54,608 --> 00:22:57,234
I wouldn't have taken you
for someone who'd do that.

70
00:22:58,524 --> 00:23:00,734
I can explain.

71
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:04,650
Kráner's involved too?

72
00:23:04,775 --> 00:23:06,734
Fifty-fifty.

73
00:23:09,984 --> 00:23:11,860
So, what happens now?

74
00:23:13,067 --> 00:23:16,901
What would happen?
We deal you in too.

75
00:23:18,568 --> 00:23:21,234
We wait till nightfall
and then we set off.

76
00:23:24,776 --> 00:23:26,735
What do you mean?

77
00:23:28,985 --> 00:23:30,776
I mean, we split it three ways.

78
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:35,193
But don't ruin me.

79
00:23:37,736 --> 00:23:42,068
All I'm asking is
to borrow your share.

80
00:23:43,068 --> 00:23:47,027
Just for a short time... A year.

81
00:23:48,027 --> 00:23:51,736
Until we can find a place
to settle down somewhere.

82
00:23:55,445 --> 00:23:58,320
And where else do you
need me to kiss you?

83
00:23:58,445 --> 00:24:01,237
You said you wouldn't
move anywhere from here.

84
00:24:01,362 --> 00:24:04,112
I don't want to stay here
until the end of my life.

85
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:09,820
I'm not asking it as
a gift. I want a loan.

86
00:24:11,445 --> 00:24:14,946
I worked as much as the others.

87
00:24:15,071 --> 00:24:17,445
And now you're
talking about "a loan".

88
00:24:18,445 --> 00:24:20,738
So you don't trust me?

89
00:24:20,863 --> 00:24:22,738
Of course not.

90
00:24:23,653 --> 00:24:26,029
You're siding with Kráner.

91
00:24:26,154 --> 00:24:28,571
You want to get away
with all the money.

92
00:24:28,697 --> 00:24:30,946
And I should trust
you after all this?

93
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:40,822
- What about the others?
- How would I know?

94
00:24:43,363 --> 00:24:46,447
We've got to wait till
dark before we leave.

95
00:24:47,864 --> 00:24:52,365
We said the same to Kráner. We
meet at the cross after dark.

96
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:00,989
Why did you come back?

97
00:25:02,615 --> 00:25:06,823
We only thought of it
on the way back home.

98
00:25:06,948 --> 00:25:10,241
And leave the woman behind?

99
00:25:10,365 --> 00:25:14,449
That's true. She's really worth it.

100
00:25:17,656 --> 00:25:22,241
- And the Kráners?
- They want to go north.

101
00:25:22,741 --> 00:25:26,157
Kraner's wife heard about
a lumber yard there...

102
00:27:25,496 --> 00:27:27,247
It's raining.

103
00:27:30,247 --> 00:27:32,080
I can hear it.

104
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:49,581
I'm going south, winters
are shorter there.

105
00:27:51,456 --> 00:27:53,748
I'll rent a farm.

106
00:27:54,956 --> 00:27:57,748
Close to a prosperous town.

107
00:27:59,624 --> 00:28:03,457
Soak my feet all day
in a basin of hot water.

108
00:28:03,582 --> 00:28:04,998
Or...

109
00:28:07,332 --> 00:28:10,832
I'll be a watchman in
a chocolate factory.

110
00:28:11,749 --> 00:28:15,457
Or a porter in a girls' dorm.

111
00:28:16,958 --> 00:28:19,707
And try to forget everything.

112
00:28:23,208 --> 00:28:26,875
A basin of hot water
and nothing to do.

113
00:28:27,833 --> 00:28:30,958
Only watch the fucking life go by.

114
00:28:58,001 --> 00:29:01,002
Where the hell do we wanna go?

115
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:04,835
We'd be caught by the
police in the first town.

116
00:29:05,752 --> 00:29:08,335
They wouldn't even ask our names.

117
00:29:13,002 --> 00:29:17,710
- Your pocket is full of money.
- That's just the point.

118
00:29:18,211 --> 00:29:21,753
Pack a suitcase and go
like a bunch of beggars.

119
00:29:21,877 --> 00:29:25,753
- None of your business.
- Pardon?

120
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:30,045
Nothing.

121
00:29:30,169 --> 00:29:32,711
Quiet or he'll wake up.

122
00:30:50,757 --> 00:30:52,632
What are we waiting for?

123
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:55,673
Why don't we divide the money?

124
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:45,259
Can't it wait?

125
00:31:50,176 --> 00:31:52,010
Let's divide it now.

126
00:31:56,594 --> 00:31:58,885
Don't worry, you'll get your share.

127
00:32:01,093 --> 00:32:06,719
Let's wait till Kráner
gives us the other half.

128
00:32:11,344 --> 00:32:13,677
It's all very simple.

129
00:32:14,178 --> 00:32:16,636
We'll split what you have.

130
00:32:16,761 --> 00:32:20,220
And the rest, when we get it,
we'll split at the crucifix.

131
00:32:26,345 --> 00:32:28,637
Fetch me the flashlight.

132
00:32:40,345 --> 00:32:42,428
The document...

133
00:32:51,888 --> 00:32:56,554
To see the money better.
So you see I'm not cheating.

134
00:33:00,346 --> 00:33:02,096
Let's count it.

135
00:34:42,685 --> 00:34:44,769
It's exactly that.

136
00:34:56,602 --> 00:34:59,436
Mrs Schmidt! Are you in?

137
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,478
- Mrs Schmidt?
- Hide it quickly.

138
00:35:03,977 --> 00:35:05,728
Get rid of her.

139
00:35:06,852 --> 00:35:10,603
If she sets foot in
here I will strangle her.

140
00:35:40,354 --> 00:35:45,188
- Will your wife be gone for a while?
- I will smash her face.

141
00:35:57,022 --> 00:35:59,272
- What did she want?
- She's gone crazy.

142
00:35:59,398 --> 00:36:02,689
She's saying that Irimiás and
Petrina are coming on the road.

143
00:36:02,814 --> 00:36:05,523
And perhaps they are
already in the pub.

144
00:36:06,773 --> 00:36:12,314
And that they may...
have already arrived.

145
00:36:12,439 --> 00:36:16,773
The conductor's seen them leave.

146
00:36:16,898 --> 00:36:21,773
He also said he'd seen
them arriving in the town.

147
00:36:22,981 --> 00:36:26,149
Then at the Elek crossroad.
They are coming here.

148
00:36:27,107 --> 00:36:29,399
The Bible's driven her mad.

149
00:36:29,524 --> 00:36:32,607
- But what if it's really true?
- Well, if it's so...

150
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:36,482
They died a year and a half
ago, everybody knows that.

151
00:36:37,066 --> 00:36:39,607
Don't fall for that, it's a trap.

152
00:36:39,732 --> 00:36:42,983
It is possible that Sanyi
Horgos has just simply lied?

153
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:48,358
- We heard it from him, too.
- Dead for a year and a half!

154
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:53,441
I suspected it then, but
nobody listened to me.

155
00:36:54,066 --> 00:36:56,776
He told us a lie. Of
course he was lying.

156
00:36:58,776 --> 00:37:01,026
You're out of your minds.

157
00:37:15,401 --> 00:37:18,693
Everything's going
to change, you'll see.

158
00:37:20,735 --> 00:37:22,984
Irimiés is a wizard.

159
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:28,777
He could build a castle
even out of cow shit...

160
00:37:29,693 --> 00:37:31,568
...if he wants to.

161
00:37:32,735 --> 00:37:34,693
No way.

162
00:37:35,943 --> 00:37:39,943
- You won't screw up my plans.
- I don't intend to.

163
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:44,736
A dead man comes
back to life? Futaki!

164
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:47,278
You, at least, should
have more sense.

165
00:37:49,903 --> 00:37:54,403
They suspect something
and want to catch us out.

166
00:37:57,403 --> 00:38:00,778
- I'm going to the pub.
- It might be true.

167
00:38:01,486 --> 00:38:03,279
Damn fools.

168
00:38:03,778 --> 00:38:08,653
If they are here, you
can't run from Irimiás.

169
00:38:08,778 --> 00:38:12,154
You know that. Right?

170
00:38:13,112 --> 00:38:15,195
You're damn fools.

171
00:38:17,279 --> 00:38:20,821
- If you don't believe it...
- Go to hell.

172
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:27,738
But you'd better leave my
money here on the table.

173
00:38:27,863 --> 00:38:31,238
If you don't believe this
then let your wife go first.

174
00:38:32,363 --> 00:38:34,238
And the money?

175
00:38:34,363 --> 00:38:37,531
Well... let's leave it where it is.

176
00:38:38,113 --> 00:38:40,572
You must trust her, don't you?

177
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,572
Then I'll go.

178
00:40:09,951 --> 00:40:11,618
Have you heard? They're here.

179
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:15,535
My husband is off already,
he just sent me to tell you.

180
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:19,243
But you should know.
We saw Mrs Halics here.

181
00:40:19,369 --> 00:40:23,785
I go now, I do not want to bother
you. My husband says, "Fuck the money."

182
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:28,452
This is not for us. Be on the run
for it? Not having a peaceful night?

183
00:40:28,577 --> 00:40:31,702
No way! Irimiás and
Petrina, you'll see...

184
00:40:31,827 --> 00:40:38,411
I always knew the shifty-eyed
Horgos kid made the whole thing up.

185
00:40:38,536 --> 00:40:43,995
You too can see it, he just made it all
up. And we believed it from the start.

186
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:47,911
- You're in it too!
- Let them come, I don't care.

187
00:41:08,537 --> 00:41:10,121
So, we're going?

188
00:42:44,793 --> 00:42:49,084
<i>So Schmidt went first.
Futaki staggered behind him.</i>

189
00:42:49,793 --> 00:42:55,001
<i>He was trying to feel his
way with his cane in the dark.</i>

190
00:42:55,793 --> 00:42:59,959
<i>And the relentless rain
blended Schmidt's swearing</i>

191
00:43:00,084 --> 00:43:04,460
<i>with Futaki's cheery,
encouraging words, as he repeated,</i>

192
00:43:04,585 --> 00:43:08,168
<i>"Never mind, old man, you'll
see. We'll have a great life!</i>

193
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:10,252
<i>'34 great life!"</i>

194
00:43:26,586 --> 00:43:36,211
We shall be resurrected!

195
00:48:03,433 --> 00:48:06,641
The two clocks show
different times.

196
00:48:09,142 --> 00:48:14,100
Both wrong, of course.
This one here is too slow.

197
00:48:16,684 --> 00:48:22,517
The other, as if it shows the
perpetuity of defencelessness.

198
00:48:24,017 --> 00:48:27,851
We only relate to it
as twigs to the rain.

199
00:48:29,059 --> 00:48:31,768
We are unable to defend ourselves.

200
00:48:33,435 --> 00:48:35,643
Twigs and rain?

201
00:48:40,352 --> 00:48:43,352
You're a great poet, I tell you.

202
00:48:57,769 --> 00:49:02,811
- Do you think there's a snack bar here?
- I don't think so.

203
00:49:20,437 --> 00:49:22,854
What are you waiting for?

204
00:49:22,979 --> 00:49:25,728
- We were summoned.
- Let me see.

205
00:49:31,063 --> 00:49:34,354
Can't you read? What floor is this?

206
00:49:37,563 --> 00:49:41,188
- The second.
- Just follow me.

207
00:50:48,732 --> 00:50:50,691
Identification.

208
00:50:50,817 --> 00:50:54,233
Can I have the summons
and your identity cards?

209
00:51:00,150 --> 00:51:03,858
Fill this out and read the
information on the back.

210
00:51:44,195 --> 00:51:45,902
Follow me.

211
00:52:53,864 --> 00:52:57,073
- Irimiés?
- Yes. That's me.

212
00:52:58,906 --> 00:53:00,781
Sit down.

213
00:53:05,114 --> 00:53:09,614
- You're a gypsy?
- No. My name's Petrina.

214
00:53:09,739 --> 00:53:13,157
Petrina? What kind
of a name is that?

215
00:53:13,282 --> 00:53:14,864
Romanian.

216
00:53:14,989 --> 00:53:19,574
- Did you know your mother?
- No.

217
00:53:22,449 --> 00:53:24,449
Irimiés.

218
00:53:32,366 --> 00:53:34,408
So here...

219
00:53:41,783 --> 00:53:45,701
It all depends on what mood I'm in.

220
00:53:55,909 --> 00:53:58,491
Let me ask you.

221
00:53:58,617 --> 00:54:05,992
Since you've been released, why
haven't you looked for a job?

222
00:54:12,076 --> 00:54:15,993
I'm sure you've been busy,
but you could've tried.

223
00:54:16,117 --> 00:54:18,660
You're under
surveillance, after all.

224
00:54:18,785 --> 00:54:26,660
And it is crystal clear that it didn't
occur to you at all to find a job.

225
00:54:26,785 --> 00:54:30,993
You know us, Captain.

226
00:54:31,118 --> 00:54:33,077
Not that well.

227
00:54:33,203 --> 00:54:36,369
You mean your future?

228
00:54:36,494 --> 00:54:39,286
But you're a young man.

229
00:54:41,869 --> 00:54:44,661
I'm not in love with my job either,

230
00:54:44,786 --> 00:54:48,162
but do you really
want to be out of work

231
00:54:48,286 --> 00:54:49,619
the rest of your life?

232
00:54:53,828 --> 00:54:54,828
Yes.

233
00:54:54,954 --> 00:54:58,870
Here's this document,
see, it says that

234
00:54:58,995 --> 00:55:03,287
you do not respect work,

235
00:55:03,412 --> 00:55:06,705
or those who work hard.

236
00:55:07,204 --> 00:55:09,162
Nice words.

237
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:12,746
But the years will go by one day.

238
00:55:12,871 --> 00:55:16,913
Do you have a wife and kids?

239
00:55:17,038 --> 00:55:20,955
You expect your son to
support you, or what?

240
00:55:21,413 --> 00:55:24,788
When your leg is broken,

241
00:55:24,913 --> 00:55:26,539
or you break your back,
you have a head injury,

242
00:55:26,664 --> 00:55:30,789
serious things, when you can't
look after yourself anymore.

243
00:55:32,371 --> 00:55:35,497
We're on the side of
the law, just like you.

244
00:55:38,914 --> 00:55:43,831
We know the law and we
haven't broken it so far.

245
00:55:43,956 --> 00:55:48,290
According to this document
all you've done is break it.

246
00:55:48,415 --> 00:55:53,122
- No.
- And with considerable effort.

247
00:55:54,665 --> 00:55:56,623
That's just what it looks like.

248
00:55:58,207 --> 00:56:01,748
And so what is the truth if
that's just what it "looks like"?

249
00:56:01,873 --> 00:56:04,124
That we're law-abiding.

250
00:56:04,248 --> 00:56:09,665
- And why start right now?
- We didn't just start now.

251
00:56:09,790 --> 00:56:13,291
You've respected the law
from your early childhood?

252
00:56:13,416 --> 00:56:16,458
- That's right.
- My grandfather respected it.

253
00:56:16,583 --> 00:56:18,958
That was your grandfather, not you.

254
00:56:20,666 --> 00:56:23,541
Talk about yourself, not
about your grandfather.

255
00:56:26,041 --> 00:56:30,917
We're loyal citizens of
this country, Captain.

256
00:56:31,042 --> 00:56:38,458
Let me remind you, our services
have been used for many years.

257
00:56:42,792 --> 00:56:45,000
How did this happen?

258
00:56:48,501 --> 00:56:52,125
Don't call your lives a tragedy.

259
00:56:53,209 --> 00:56:56,418
Be humble, no tragedy.

260
00:56:56,543 --> 00:56:59,960
- You know us, Captain.
- Of course I do.

261
00:57:00,085 --> 00:57:03,336
But this is not a tragedy,
it's plain villainy.

262
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:06,085
Why don't we leave
everything as before?

263
00:57:06,210 --> 00:57:10,710
Leave it as before? You'll
never want to change?

264
00:57:12,419 --> 00:57:18,001
Not that human life
is so highly valued.

265
00:57:18,752 --> 00:57:23,627
Keeping order may seem to be the
responsibility of the authorities.

266
00:57:24,711 --> 00:57:28,544
But lately it's the business
of the people. The order.

267
00:57:29,419 --> 00:57:34,711
In freedom, there is,
however, something not human,

268
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:40,920
but rather, divine.

269
00:57:41,836 --> 00:57:45,628
But our lives are too short for
us to find out this properly.

270
00:57:45,753 --> 00:57:56,670
If you searching for a link between
order and freedom, think of Pericles.

271
00:57:58,379 --> 00:58:03,379
He said order and freedom
are linked by passion.

272
00:58:04,379 --> 00:58:08,672
We have to believe in both,
as we suffer from both.

273
00:58:09,171 --> 00:58:12,088
Both from order and freedom.

274
00:58:14,379 --> 00:58:18,839
But human life is meaningful,
rich, beautiful and filthy.

275
00:58:18,964 --> 00:58:21,130
It encompasses everything.

276
00:58:21,672 --> 00:58:28,672
But we abuse freedom, wasting
it as if it were just some junk.

277
00:58:28,797 --> 00:58:34,130
People don't like freedom.
They are afraid of it.

278
00:58:34,798 --> 00:58:42,423
This is strange, because there is
nothing to fear when it comes to freedom.

279
00:58:44,256 --> 00:58:50,006
Order, on the other hand,
can often be frightening.

280
00:58:56,507 --> 00:59:00,132
But I must draw your
attention to certain points.

281
00:59:00,257 --> 00:59:04,007
The fact of the matter is,

282
00:59:05,049 --> 00:59:08,591
you have no choice
but to cooperate.

283
00:59:10,883 --> 00:59:16,883
And my point is, that if
you really respect the law,

284
00:59:17,008 --> 00:59:22,842
then, it is obvious, that I'm
just a little ahead of you in this.

285
00:59:22,967 --> 00:59:27,050
Practically you have... offered it.

286
00:59:27,175 --> 00:59:30,801
We do respect you a lot, Captain...

287
00:59:30,925 --> 00:59:33,843
Not "captain". The law!

288
00:59:34,926 --> 00:59:37,509
But you're the law itself, Captain.

289
00:59:37,634 --> 00:59:41,259
Oh, no. The law, that's
all of us together.

290
00:59:42,009 --> 00:59:43,676
Why not leave things as they are?

291
00:59:43,801 --> 00:59:47,301
Right now you, for
instance, are outlaws.

292
00:59:48,259 --> 00:59:50,759
And you know very well why.

293
00:59:53,051 --> 00:59:56,260
I suppose I do not have
to read out the lot.

294
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:59,927
I won't say this again.

295
01:00:00,510 --> 01:00:03,677
From now on, you either work for me

296
01:00:03,802 --> 01:00:07,510
or... well, I have to say,
you really have no choice.

297
01:00:12,802 --> 01:00:14,927
Mr Irimiás.

298
01:00:30,636 --> 01:00:32,803
You can go now.

299
01:01:47,224 --> 01:01:49,599
Two rum and liqueurs.

300
01:01:50,849 --> 01:01:53,266
And a pack of cigarettes.

301
01:02:01,808 --> 01:02:04,683
- Large ones I meant.
- Sorry.

302
01:02:04,808 --> 01:02:06,891
Move aside, please.

303
01:02:15,516 --> 01:02:18,726
May I just remind
you of the cigarettes?

304
01:02:18,851 --> 01:02:21,309
Sorry, I forgot.

305
01:02:22,601 --> 01:02:25,184
May we ask what's so funny?

306
01:02:25,309 --> 01:02:28,392
Nothing. Sorry.

307
01:02:43,143 --> 01:02:45,227
Can you hear that?

308
01:02:49,143 --> 01:02:51,186
What is it?

309
01:02:51,311 --> 01:02:53,186
A machine?

310
01:02:57,810 --> 01:02:59,810
The lights?

311
01:03:01,144 --> 01:03:03,394
Someone's singing?

312
01:03:04,811 --> 01:03:07,144
Who would dare to sing in here?

313
01:03:11,228 --> 01:03:13,603
Quiet!

314
01:03:52,146 --> 01:03:55,146
We'll blow everything up.

315
01:03:55,731 --> 01:03:58,897
- Should we call the police?
- There's no need.

316
01:04:06,897 --> 01:04:09,689
We'll blow them all up.

317
01:04:11,064 --> 01:04:14,731
We'll plant explosives in their
jackets... or in their ears.

318
01:04:15,315 --> 01:04:18,398
We'll stick the
dynamite up their noses.

319
01:04:22,690 --> 01:04:26,148
We'll have to stop this
somehow, don't you think?

320
01:04:35,316 --> 01:04:38,316
Sure, why complicate things?

321
01:04:39,149 --> 01:04:42,191
We'll blow them up one by one.

322
01:04:51,691 --> 01:04:54,274
We'll kill them all.

323
01:04:54,399 --> 01:04:57,067
In a very short time.

324
01:05:34,901 --> 01:05:37,985
How do you know
they're still there?

325
01:05:38,110 --> 01:05:42,068
I think they had ran away long
time ago if they have any sense.

326
01:05:42,194 --> 01:05:48,319
Them? They were servants and
will remain so all their lives.

327
01:05:48,444 --> 01:05:51,527
They sit in the kitchen,
shit in the corner,

328
01:05:51,652 --> 01:05:54,070
now and then they look out the
window to see what others do.

329
01:05:54,195 --> 01:05:57,028
I know them inside out.

330
01:05:57,153 --> 01:06:00,278
What makes you so sure?

331
01:06:00,403 --> 01:06:05,695
I think nobody's there. The houses
are empty, the roof tiles are stolen...

332
01:06:05,819 --> 01:06:09,320
At best, one or two rats are
in the mill, all skin and bone.

333
01:06:09,445 --> 01:06:14,153
They just sit on the
same dirty stools.

334
01:06:14,278 --> 01:06:19,445
Stuff themselves with potatoes
and don't know what's happened.

335
01:06:19,570 --> 01:06:23,946
They eye each other suspiciously
as they belch away in the silence,

336
01:06:24,071 --> 01:06:30,863
and wait determinedly, because
they think they had been cheated.

337
01:06:31,321 --> 01:06:33,321
They are slaves who
have lost their master.

338
01:06:33,446 --> 01:06:37,739
They can't live without
pride, dignity and courage,

339
01:06:37,864 --> 01:06:43,321
but they don't feel such
qualities reside within them.

340
01:06:43,447 --> 01:06:46,114
They only know how to live
in the shadow of such things.

341
01:06:46,239 --> 01:06:47,655
Cut it out, will you?

342
01:06:47,780 --> 01:06:52,697
They follow that shadow,
like lemmings, off a cliff.

343
01:06:52,822 --> 01:06:57,905
They can't live
without their fantasies.

344
01:06:58,740 --> 01:07:08,448
But when they get too
close, they can't handle it.

345
01:07:08,573 --> 01:07:12,448
What they really need is a heated
room and a bowl of hot paprika stew.

346
01:07:12,573 --> 01:07:15,990
They're happy if at
night, under a warm quilt

347
01:07:16,116 --> 01:07:19,074
they find the
neighbour's chubby wife.

348
01:07:19,199 --> 01:07:22,199
- Are you listening at all?
- Sure, whatever.

349
01:08:39,536 --> 01:08:42,785
- I've been waiting for you for a while.
- How'd you know we were coming?

350
01:08:42,910 --> 01:08:45,620
- From the conductor.
- What conductor?

351
01:08:45,745 --> 01:08:48,995
- Kelemen.
- Why? Kelemen became a conductor?

352
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:52,370
Since the spring, on the coach.

353
01:08:52,495 --> 01:08:56,162
But the coach doesn't run now.

354
01:08:57,786 --> 01:09:02,578
You promised that if I spread the
rumour on the farm that you had died,

355
01:09:02,703 --> 01:09:04,536
you'd hook me up with Mrs Schmidt.

356
01:09:04,661 --> 01:09:06,746
I keep my promises.

357
01:09:06,871 --> 01:09:11,204
And you promised me Mrs Kráner.
She has nice tits, that one.

358
01:09:11,329 --> 01:09:13,329
That will happen too, Sanyi.

359
01:09:14,496 --> 01:09:18,287
Since you left here,
not much has changed.

360
01:09:18,872 --> 01:09:22,080
The schoolmaster's
still at home, alone.

361
01:09:22,204 --> 01:09:25,705
Mrs Schmidt's with Futaki.
You know, the cripple.

362
01:09:25,830 --> 01:09:29,913
My younger sister is totally
crazy. Spies on everybody.

363
01:09:31,997 --> 01:09:36,498
My mum tries to beat the crazy out of her,
but everyone knows she's nuts for life.

364
01:09:37,122 --> 01:09:39,748
The Doctor broods at home.

365
01:09:40,623 --> 01:09:44,205
He sits in his armchair, leaves
the lights on all the time.

366
01:09:50,623 --> 01:09:52,873
Sometimes he sleeps in his chair.

367
01:09:54,956 --> 01:09:58,998
His place smells like hell, even
though he smokes good cigarettes.

368
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:06,749
Drinks a lot of fruit brandy.
Mrs Kráner keeps him supplied.

369
01:10:09,082 --> 01:10:12,749
Schmidt and Kráner are bringing
the money for the cattle today.

370
01:10:15,207 --> 01:10:18,374
Everyone's been doing that
since February, except Mum.

371
01:10:18,499 --> 01:10:23,125
Those bastards didn't include her,
they are happy to have lots of money.

372
01:10:23,791 --> 01:10:26,333
The bar owner's sold
his good Pannonia

373
01:10:26,458 --> 01:10:30,500
and bought a piece of crap you
have to push to get started.

374
01:10:30,625 --> 01:10:34,166
He uses that to go to town
to see his wife once a month,

375
01:10:34,291 --> 01:10:39,083
although now he lives at my
sister's because we still owe him

376
01:10:40,709 --> 01:10:43,250
for what he lent us
to buy seeds last year.

377
01:14:58,680 --> 01:15:02,972
<i>In the east, the sky clears as
fast as a memory is forgotten.</i>

378
01:15:04,138 --> 01:15:08,847
<i>At dawn, it leans all
red on the waving horizon.</i>

379
01:15:08,972 --> 01:15:16,515
<i>In the same way the beggar trudges
up the back steps of a church,</i>

380
01:15:16,639 --> 01:15:21,097
<i>the sun rises to give
life to the shadows,</i>

381
01:15:21,222 --> 01:15:27,306
<i>and to separate earth
and sky, man and animal,</i>

382
01:15:27,431 --> 01:15:30,348
<i>from the disturbing, strange unity</i>

383
01:15:30,473 --> 01:15:33,848
<i>in which they became
inextricably intertwined.</i>

384
01:15:33,973 --> 01:15:38,057
<i>He saw the fleeing
night on the other side,</i>

385
01:15:38,182 --> 01:15:42,182
<i>as its terrifying elements
disappear on the western horizon,</i>

386
01:15:42,307 --> 01:15:47,182
<i>like a desperate,
defeated, confused army.</i>

387
01:15:49,307 --> 01:15:59,307
To know something

388
01:22:26,661 --> 01:22:32,911
Futaki... it seems...

389
01:22:34,202 --> 01:22:39,952
...is afraid... of something.

390
01:22:42,120 --> 01:22:50,328
Early... morning... startled...

391
01:22:50,453 --> 01:22:55,787
...he was looking...
out... of the window.

392
01:22:59,037 --> 01:23:01,328
Futaki...

393
01:23:02,078 --> 01:23:10,537
...is terrified...
he's afraid of death.

394
01:23:35,872 --> 01:23:42,997
They'll die anyway. You
too, Futaki, you'll die too.

395
01:30:23,601 --> 01:30:32,225
Schmidt... leaves
through... the back door...

396
01:30:35,351 --> 01:30:38,935
...and stands... on top of...

397
01:30:39,518 --> 01:30:49,186
...the path to... Sodic Park.

398
01:30:49,311 --> 01:31:00,394
Futaki... quietly... slips
out of... the house...

399
01:31:02,311 --> 01:31:08,145
...crosses... over
to the stables...

400
01:31:09,062 --> 01:31:16,769
...and hides... by the wall.

401
01:31:18,520 --> 01:31:23,896
F. doesn't move.

402
01:31:24,896 --> 01:31:30,312
He waits... for a moment...

403
01:31:31,146 --> 01:31:41,063
...then... he too...
dashes... over to the door...

404
01:31:43,146 --> 01:31:53,647
...knocks, and... enters
quickly... after Schmidt.

405
01:31:55,897 --> 01:32:03,022
What a... hustle and bustle.

406
01:32:07,189 --> 01:32:13,064
It has started... to rain.

407
01:32:13,731 --> 01:32:20,565
It won't... stop... till... spring.

408
01:34:02,070 --> 01:34:05,445
It is fascinating to see,

409
01:34:05,570 --> 01:34:12,528
the erosion caused
by water and wind

410
01:34:12,653 --> 01:34:14,987
at the edge of the Ponticum,

411
01:34:15,112 --> 01:34:21,362
when the sea on the Great
Plain had significantly receded

412
01:34:21,487 --> 01:34:27,237
and it looked like a shallow
lake, like Lake Balaton does now.

413
01:35:52,909 --> 01:35:54,742
Good morning, Doctor.

414
01:36:00,117 --> 01:36:02,409
Quickly, Doctor,
don't let it get cold.

415
01:36:02,992 --> 01:36:04,826
Take it away.

416
01:36:30,328 --> 01:36:34,660
You see, it's raining,
we'll soon have snow, too.

417
01:36:34,785 --> 01:36:39,786
My husband and I feel, it would be
good if you could talk to the pub owner.

418
01:36:39,910 --> 01:36:43,244
He has a car, he could
bring you this stuff.

419
01:36:43,703 --> 01:36:47,786
You mean you won't anymore?

420
01:36:49,037 --> 01:36:54,037
I will, but I can't go on
foot into town in this rain.

421
01:36:54,162 --> 01:36:58,703
Besides, he has a car and could do
your shopping for two or three weeks.

422
01:36:58,829 --> 01:37:01,787
The bus only starts
running again in spring.

423
01:37:01,912 --> 01:37:04,912
It's all right, Mrs
Kráner, you can go.

424
01:37:06,746 --> 01:37:08,705
Then you'll talk to the pub owner?

425
01:37:08,830 --> 01:37:11,370
I'll talk to whoever I want to!

426
01:37:14,038 --> 01:37:18,370
- Where shall I put the keys?
- Wherever you want it.

427
01:37:22,705 --> 01:37:24,746
Good bye.

428
01:40:50,548 --> 01:40:54,174
K. has quit.

429
01:40:58,756 --> 01:41:00,798
She can't...

430
01:41:03,757 --> 01:41:06,174
...do it... any longer.

431
01:41:08,883 --> 01:41:13,967
Last autumn... she didn't...

432
01:41:14,507 --> 01:41:20,258
...mind...

433
01:41:20,800 --> 01:41:23,008
...the rain...

434
01:41:25,342 --> 01:41:29,342
...nor that...

435
01:41:30,676 --> 01:41:35,801
...she had to... walk.

436
01:41:40,676 --> 01:41:42,509
K. has...

437
01:41:49,051 --> 01:41:54,759
...a specific plan.

438
01:42:00,926 --> 01:42:05,093
She's thinking... about
something... in her head.

439
01:46:00,522 --> 01:46:03,522
It seems I got pretty drunk.

440
01:51:19,622 --> 01:51:28,663
Today I ran out... of the
last drop... of fruit brandy.

441
01:51:32,330 --> 01:51:38,498
It looks like I need...

442
01:51:39,163 --> 01:51:45,664
...to leave... the house.

443
01:57:27,431 --> 01:57:30,306
Come on, cut that out.

444
01:57:31,640 --> 01:57:34,765
You hear me? Stop that.

445
01:57:36,099 --> 01:57:38,515
Look after the fire
instead, I'm cold.

446
01:57:38,640 --> 01:57:40,306
I'll look after my arse, man.

447
01:57:40,431 --> 01:57:44,141
I've just looked after
it... You're next.

448
01:57:44,266 --> 01:57:48,141
- You hear me?
- All right, all right.

449
01:57:50,391 --> 01:57:55,266
We're going to freeze again.

450
01:58:00,266 --> 01:58:03,850
- How long are we supposed to wait?
- How do I know?

451
01:58:03,975 --> 01:58:05,892
Leave me alone.

452
01:58:06,641 --> 01:58:09,267
To hell with the whole thing.

453
02:00:26,982 --> 02:00:29,357
Stop whining. Someone's coming.

454
02:00:33,065 --> 02:00:34,982
Good evening.

455
02:00:38,274 --> 02:00:41,274
Haven't seen you for ages, Doc.

456
02:00:42,649 --> 02:00:44,775
Feel like a screw?

457
02:00:44,900 --> 02:00:47,108
I'd like to warm up a
bit if you don't mind.

458
02:00:47,233 --> 02:00:51,483
- Only warm up, Doc?
- Yes.

459
02:00:55,608 --> 02:00:58,150
And what about a good
fuck like in the old days?

460
02:00:59,150 --> 02:01:03,066
Come on, Doctor. It
doesn't cost much.

461
02:01:05,108 --> 02:01:07,942
For such an old friend.

462
02:01:14,984 --> 02:01:17,984
Could I have a cigarette?

463
02:01:20,360 --> 02:01:24,026
- Right there, at your feet.
- Thank you.

464
02:01:49,278 --> 02:01:53,528
- How's business going?
- Bad.

465
02:01:53,653 --> 02:02:00,778
You see, we just sit here
day after day and nothing.

466
02:02:01,278 --> 02:02:05,862
We're all nerves, we
almost go at each other.

467
02:02:05,987 --> 02:02:08,444
What's going to become of us, Doc?

468
02:02:08,569 --> 02:02:11,779
It's the way a person loses
heart in the whole thing.

469
02:02:16,654 --> 02:02:19,362
What do you think we live on?

470
02:02:21,655 --> 02:02:27,613
We have Sanyi living with
us, crazy Estike, Mum too.

471
02:02:29,821 --> 02:02:32,445
They keep asking where's the money?

472
02:02:33,988 --> 02:02:35,738
Give it to them.

473
02:02:36,280 --> 02:02:38,988
The money this, the money that,

474
02:02:39,988 --> 02:02:42,280
but who cares?

475
02:02:43,572 --> 02:02:47,656
We'll leave here anyway.
We'll move to town.

476
02:02:47,781 --> 02:02:51,281
Cut the crap. Either go or stay.

477
02:02:51,406 --> 02:02:54,364
It would make you happy if
I cleared off, wouldn't it?

478
02:02:56,239 --> 02:02:59,656
Today, when they
finally get the money?

479
02:03:00,364 --> 02:03:03,822
They're not coming. They
should've arrived ages ago.

480
02:03:03,947 --> 02:03:07,157
They'll come. I know them.

481
02:03:07,282 --> 02:03:10,864
When they've got money,
they run after their dicks.

482
02:03:11,490 --> 02:03:15,323
You think Kráner admits to
the whole amount at home?

483
02:03:16,198 --> 02:03:18,865
There will be a hell of
a lot of money here today!

484
02:03:18,991 --> 02:03:22,323
- Can I have a cigarette for the road?
- Sure.

485
02:03:27,448 --> 02:03:30,241
- Matches?
- Take them.

486
02:03:36,116 --> 02:03:39,283
So, you won't change
your mind, Doctor?

487
02:03:39,949 --> 02:03:43,825
No. Good luck.

488
02:03:44,950 --> 02:03:46,784
You too.

489
02:04:08,992 --> 02:04:11,618
He hasn't got a lot of time left.

490
02:04:15,410 --> 02:04:18,410
You'd hardly recognise him.

491
02:04:22,868 --> 02:04:25,244
What the hell is he
doing here in the rain?

492
02:04:25,369 --> 02:04:29,619
He hardly leaves the house. Now
he comes out in this weather?

493
02:04:33,661 --> 02:04:36,161
Idiot. Didn't you see the bottle?

494
02:04:36,286 --> 02:04:38,494
Goes to pick up his brandy.

495
02:04:42,078 --> 02:04:45,869
He doesn't even have the
money to pay Mrs Kráner.

496
02:09:32,300 --> 02:09:34,134
- Doctor.
- What do you want?

497
02:09:34,258 --> 02:09:38,592
- Doctor.
- What are you doing? Let me go.

498
02:09:38,717 --> 02:09:42,342
- Leave me, go now, you brat.
- Doctor!

499
02:09:42,468 --> 02:09:44,801
Leave me alone, you brat.

500
02:09:48,009 --> 02:09:49,677
Fucking hell.

501
02:09:55,009 --> 02:09:59,010
Where are you going now? Wait.

502
02:10:02,427 --> 02:10:04,261
Where are you going?

503
02:10:07,261 --> 02:10:09,094
Stop!

504
02:10:10,802 --> 02:10:12,635
I won't hurt you.

505
02:10:13,469 --> 02:10:15,136
Stop!

506
02:10:18,553 --> 02:10:20,969
Where are you running?

507
02:10:21,094 --> 02:10:22,929
Wait.

508
02:12:07,099 --> 02:12:11,767
Hallo, hallo...

509
02:12:11,892 --> 02:12:13,725
Now there...

510
02:15:33,527 --> 02:15:35,235
Time to get off.

511
02:16:35,112 --> 02:16:39,113
<i>"My heart," he
thought, over and over.</i>

512
02:16:40,655 --> 02:16:45,072
<i>He longed to lie in a warm room,</i>

513
02:16:45,197 --> 02:16:49,281
<i>to be taken care of
by sweet little nurses,</i>

514
02:16:49,406 --> 02:16:51,655
<i>sipping his hot soup,</i>

515
02:16:51,780 --> 02:16:54,531
<i>then turning towards the wall.</i>

516
02:16:55,698 --> 02:16:57,781
<i>He felt light and easy,</i>

517
02:16:57,905 --> 02:17:03,072
<i>though the conductor's scolding
words echoed long in his ears.</i>

518
02:17:04,198 --> 02:17:07,031
<i>"You shouldn't have
done it, Doctor.</i>

519
02:17:07,157 --> 02:17:09,489
<i>"You shouldn't have done it."</i>

520
02:17:17,949 --> 02:17:24,615
INTERMISSION

521
02:17:25,782 --> 02:17:35,532
The work of the spider I

522
02:18:35,453 --> 02:18:37,411
You could light a fire.

523
02:18:42,328 --> 02:18:43,994
I could.

524
02:18:55,411 --> 02:18:57,995
I said, you could light a fire.

525
02:19:09,954 --> 02:19:12,580
Stop this.

526
02:19:28,121 --> 02:19:30,205
A litre.

527
02:20:01,498 --> 02:20:04,498
Pick up the hundred for me too.

528
02:20:08,332 --> 02:20:11,041
You only got the
denomination wrong.

529
02:20:16,415 --> 02:20:18,874
Don't worry, pinhead.

530
02:20:20,416 --> 02:20:25,249
I won't do you any
harm. Just quit pointing.

531
02:22:05,546 --> 02:22:07,421
It's raining.

532
02:22:15,464 --> 02:22:17,129
Awful weather.

533
02:22:23,089 --> 02:22:24,380
Yeah.

534
02:22:27,047 --> 02:22:28,755
It destroys everything.

535
02:22:32,880 --> 02:22:35,797
Look at this coat, what
it looks like on me.

536
02:22:40,715 --> 02:22:43,506
This used to be as soft as butter,

537
02:22:50,091 --> 02:22:52,465
and now, it's so dried out,

538
02:22:54,506 --> 02:22:57,465
if I want to sit down,
I have to break it.

539
02:22:58,465 --> 02:22:59,882
Look.

540
02:23:00,715 --> 02:23:04,674
Here, at my groin, with
the edge of my hand.

541
02:23:05,882 --> 02:23:07,882
That's how I do it.

542
02:23:13,842 --> 02:23:17,925
Flexibility, you know,
that's what's missing.

543
02:23:18,050 --> 02:23:19,717
Totally missing.

544
02:23:21,967 --> 02:23:25,133
Then the wind, it can't
keep that out either.

545
02:23:26,467 --> 02:23:32,050
The whole thing's creased. The
leather's crumbling, you see.

546
02:23:35,509 --> 02:23:40,217
You go here and there. Can't
sit inside all the time.

547
02:23:41,051 --> 02:23:44,926
And it gets soaked
inside and outside...

548
02:23:47,884 --> 02:23:50,968
Because the worst is not out there,

549
02:23:51,093 --> 02:23:53,593
but in here.

550
02:23:57,177 --> 02:24:00,135
You haven't heard of the
inside rains, of course not.

551
02:24:02,093 --> 02:24:04,009
You've been saying this for years.

552
02:24:08,927 --> 02:24:12,969
They bathe your
organs night and day.

553
02:24:14,469 --> 02:24:17,802
They come from the heart,

554
02:24:17,928 --> 02:24:23,845
and wash the liver, the stomach,
the spleen and the kidneys.

555
02:24:30,345 --> 02:24:32,470
I am soaking wet.

556
02:24:35,054 --> 02:24:37,846
If it were not for this coat,
I don't know what'd happen.

557
02:24:41,096 --> 02:24:42,887
I don't even dare unbutton it.

558
02:24:46,012 --> 02:24:48,387
A glass of wine
would, of course, help.

559
02:25:00,722 --> 02:25:04,597
Then there's the constant
demand from the liver,

560
02:25:04,722 --> 02:25:09,222
the stomach, the
spleen and the kidneys.

561
02:25:12,473 --> 02:25:15,138
They have to work all the time.

562
02:25:17,180 --> 02:25:18,888
Without a break.

563
02:25:20,389 --> 02:25:24,306
Then this constant
drenching can turn into

564
02:25:24,431 --> 02:25:26,431
a sudden drying out.

565
02:25:28,473 --> 02:25:33,099
Which can soon... turn fatal.

566
02:25:42,349 --> 02:25:44,224
Listen, give me a glass.

567
02:25:46,599 --> 02:25:50,349
Schmidt and Kráner will
be here soon anyway,

568
02:25:50,474 --> 02:25:53,474
they will count what
I'm supposed to get.

569
02:25:58,474 --> 02:25:59,975
Fine.

570
02:26:22,559 --> 02:26:24,892
Nice little wine.

571
02:26:25,017 --> 02:26:27,017
Give me one more.

572
02:27:04,394 --> 02:27:06,144
He's fallen asleep.

573
02:27:14,812 --> 02:27:17,353
How much you think this
one's supposed to eat?

574
02:27:19,394 --> 02:27:21,478
It doesn't eat, it devours.

575
02:27:27,145 --> 02:27:30,270
It can eat half a pig in one
go. Would you believe that?

576
02:27:35,020 --> 02:27:36,520
I would.

577
02:27:45,563 --> 02:27:47,313
That was very close.

578
02:28:09,106 --> 02:28:12,356
Irimiés and Petrina are
coming toward the yard.

579
02:28:20,232 --> 02:28:23,232
- They can't be.
- It's as true as I'm here.

580
02:28:23,897 --> 02:28:28,232
The hauler from the
lumber yard was there,

581
02:28:28,357 --> 02:28:30,941
two loaders...

582
02:28:32,148 --> 02:28:38,983
...the schoolmaster,
the PE teacher...

583
02:28:40,233 --> 02:28:42,066
...and the night barman
from the station café.

584
02:28:42,191 --> 02:28:44,358
And I sat there.

585
02:28:45,690 --> 02:28:47,774
Just sat there!

586
02:28:47,899 --> 02:28:50,733
I couldn't believe my eyes.

587
02:28:56,399 --> 02:29:00,149
And... there they were!

588
02:29:00,274 --> 02:29:03,650
Irimiés and Petrina,
drinking rum and liqueurs!

589
02:29:05,942 --> 02:29:09,109
I waited till they drank up,

590
02:29:09,234 --> 02:29:11,359
and went up to them.

591
02:29:11,485 --> 02:29:14,650
Irimiés gave me a hug and asked,

592
02:29:14,775 --> 02:29:17,859
"Kelemen! How's it going?"

593
02:29:19,234 --> 02:29:22,485
Then he told me everything.

594
02:29:23,901 --> 02:29:26,985
Then off we went.

595
02:29:27,109 --> 02:29:31,110
I had to see Hochan the butcher.

596
02:29:32,860 --> 02:29:38,943
Then... I met young Tóth,

597
02:29:39,068 --> 02:29:43,901
who used to be my
neighbour in Péstanya.

598
02:29:45,361 --> 02:29:50,194
He told me that Irimiás

599
02:29:50,319 --> 02:29:55,402
had been at the Steigerwald's

600
02:29:55,527 --> 02:29:58,527
and talked about gunpowder.

601
02:29:59,486 --> 02:30:03,569
The Steigerwald kids were
talking about it in the street.

602
02:30:05,487 --> 02:30:09,653
And when I was on my way back...

603
02:30:10,862 --> 02:30:13,362
...and turned off...

604
02:30:16,612 --> 02:30:20,029
...at the Elek crossroad...

605
02:30:21,528 --> 02:30:24,528
...I caught sight of them.

606
02:30:25,904 --> 02:30:29,238
And then I understood,

607
02:30:29,363 --> 02:30:33,029
what, how, and why.

608
02:32:55,787 --> 02:32:58,203
Irimiés! Petrina!

609
02:32:58,328 --> 02:33:00,578
I'll get rid of them, drunken pigs!

610
02:33:03,245 --> 02:33:06,787
I'll turn the lights off
and board up the place.

611
02:33:07,495 --> 02:33:10,704
Irimiés and Petrina! They
can't take what is mine.

612
02:33:10,829 --> 02:33:13,912
Mine! Everything
here is mine! Mine!

613
02:33:14,412 --> 02:33:19,830
Irimiés! Petrina!
Everything is mine! Mine!

614
02:33:20,287 --> 02:33:21,580
Petrina!

615
02:36:09,295 --> 02:36:11,505
Then I went up to them.

616
02:36:11,630 --> 02:36:16,505
Irimiés hugged me and said warmly,

617
02:36:16,630 --> 02:36:20,296
"Kelemen! How's it going?"

618
02:36:20,422 --> 02:36:23,921
And right away he bought a round.

619
02:36:24,046 --> 02:36:30,171
The waitresses smiled and
jumped to it like grasshoppers.

620
02:36:30,297 --> 02:36:33,464
And then he told me everything.

621
02:36:36,297 --> 02:36:39,922
So tell me, have you
learned your lesson?

622
02:36:40,047 --> 02:36:41,589
What lesson?

623
02:36:41,714 --> 02:36:45,756
Leave me alone. I've
learned all I need to.

624
02:36:45,881 --> 02:36:48,007
You've never learned anything.
You just keep drinking.

625
02:36:48,132 --> 02:36:50,257
I've learned it all, you old witch.

626
02:36:50,382 --> 02:36:53,757
I want no one meddling
in my business.

627
02:36:53,882 --> 02:36:56,215
In the book of your fate though,

628
02:36:56,340 --> 02:36:58,090
this resurrection is written.

629
02:36:58,215 --> 02:37:01,215
- Don't give me that nonsense.
- But you just go on boozing.

630
02:37:01,340 --> 02:37:04,091
Boozing, sure I'm boozing.

631
02:37:04,216 --> 02:37:07,507
Listen, you witch, why
do you think I'm here?

632
02:37:07,632 --> 02:37:13,466
I came to drink, not to look
pretty for the likes of you.

633
02:37:13,591 --> 02:37:15,424
You know what's waiting
for the likes of you?

634
02:37:15,549 --> 02:37:18,049
No one happens to
be waiting for me.

635
02:37:18,174 --> 02:37:19,341
The blackest fire of hell.

636
02:37:19,466 --> 02:37:22,258
You may have seen a black fucking
arse, but not a black fire,

637
02:37:22,383 --> 02:37:27,424
so fuck the black arse and the fire
and go to fucking hell. That's it.

638
02:37:27,550 --> 02:37:29,800
You think they'll stand
for this forever up there?

639
02:37:29,925 --> 02:37:31,259
No.

640
02:37:31,383 --> 02:37:33,259
Think they sit up
there and just ignore

641
02:37:33,384 --> 02:37:35,884
this Sodom and Gomorrah?

642
02:37:36,009 --> 02:37:37,842
That's exactly it.

643
02:37:37,967 --> 02:37:42,635
There'll be weeping and
mourning, as the prophet says.

644
02:37:42,759 --> 02:37:49,468
No Creation. Spritzer!
Creation is a spritzer.

645
02:37:49,593 --> 02:37:52,551
- None of your business.
- He's always like that, sorry.

646
02:37:52,676 --> 02:37:57,718
A hell of a witch.
Old cobwebbed cunt.

647
02:37:57,843 --> 02:37:59,885
You'd better read this.

648
02:38:00,010 --> 02:38:02,676
Leave the poor thing alone.

649
02:38:02,801 --> 02:38:05,718
Get him a spritzer instead.

650
02:38:05,843 --> 02:38:10,302
Spritzer withdrawal
is a kind of murder.

651
02:38:10,427 --> 02:38:13,552
Don't read Genesis, you poor thing.

652
02:38:13,677 --> 02:38:16,177
That's a mystery.

653
02:38:16,302 --> 02:38:18,802
Read Revelation.

654
02:38:18,928 --> 02:38:22,302
You know what we're
all waiting for?

655
02:38:22,427 --> 02:38:28,095
If you haven't heard it
before, for you to go to hell.

656
02:38:30,053 --> 02:38:34,803
But there's no use waiting, it
doesn't matter if you go away.

657
02:38:34,928 --> 02:38:39,345
It doesn't matter if we
can't see you or hear you.

658
02:38:39,470 --> 02:38:42,595
You'll leave your stench behind.

659
02:38:42,721 --> 02:38:45,303
It lasts forever.

660
02:38:46,303 --> 02:38:50,263
It's no use opening a
window and airing the room.

661
02:38:50,387 --> 02:38:52,054
It remains.

662
02:39:00,054 --> 02:39:01,888
Mrs Schmidt.

663
02:39:03,389 --> 02:39:07,639
Halics can't imagine what
happened to your husband.

664
02:39:09,597 --> 02:39:12,014
You see, this lousy weather.

665
02:39:23,764 --> 02:39:25,764
What can I get you?

666
02:39:29,515 --> 02:39:33,140
- Some cherry pálinka?
- I don't really know.

667
02:39:35,556 --> 02:39:37,056
A small one.

668
02:39:58,974 --> 02:40:02,975
- Have you heard it?
- Are you sure that they must be them?

669
02:40:04,017 --> 02:40:05,516
Must be.

670
02:40:07,307 --> 02:40:09,808
They'll be here in the morning.

671
02:40:22,559 --> 02:40:27,267
They'll be here by midnight.
Takes three hours to get here.

672
02:40:27,393 --> 02:40:30,267
- It's not three hours.
- Why isn't it three hours?

673
02:40:30,393 --> 02:40:32,809
Because it takes much longer.

674
02:40:32,934 --> 02:40:36,351
Won't be any arrivals
before the morning.

675
02:40:36,476 --> 02:40:37,809
Why the morning?

676
02:40:37,934 --> 02:40:42,185
If the three hours
took me three hours,

677
02:40:42,310 --> 02:40:46,477
the three hours will
take them four hours.

678
02:40:46,602 --> 02:40:49,185
They will be here by midnight.

679
02:40:49,310 --> 02:40:53,602
By morning, that road is
full of potholes and ruts.

680
02:40:53,727 --> 02:40:57,060
They'll go round the potholes.
They'll avoid the ruts.

681
02:40:57,185 --> 02:41:02,186
They won't go through the
potholes, or the ruts, you're right,

682
02:41:02,310 --> 02:41:07,186
so they won't be here by
midnight, but by morning.

683
02:41:07,311 --> 02:41:10,644
By morning if they use
the road. I come from here.

684
02:41:10,769 --> 02:41:14,270
They can only come by that
road, they'll only walk on that,

685
02:41:14,395 --> 02:41:17,061
- they care about their shoes.
- Their shoes?

686
02:41:17,186 --> 02:41:18,854
Yes, their shoes. That
road is a long way round.

687
02:41:18,978 --> 02:41:20,395
It's soaked.

688
02:41:20,520 --> 02:41:22,353
It's like having to
go around the sea.

689
02:41:22,478 --> 02:41:24,854
Their shoes! Never mind them.

690
02:41:24,979 --> 02:41:26,979
They'll be here by midnight.

691
02:41:27,104 --> 02:41:29,771
They weren't soaking wet.
The road goes by the fire.

692
02:41:29,896 --> 02:41:32,896
Are you from here?
Have you been there?

693
02:41:33,021 --> 02:41:36,771
I saw them, I kept
going, and I came here.

694
02:41:36,896 --> 02:41:39,312
I saw them, and they'll
be here by midnight.

695
02:41:39,437 --> 02:41:42,354
They're coming by the road and
won't be here before morning.

696
02:41:42,480 --> 02:41:46,897
- Don't give me that.
- They can only come by the road

697
02:41:47,021 --> 02:41:51,647
and that takes a turn
like going round the sea.

698
02:41:51,772 --> 02:41:55,772
Don't give me that, I'm from here.

699
02:41:59,438 --> 02:42:02,105
What's wrong with
this fucking stove?

700
02:42:02,231 --> 02:42:05,314
This is a pub, not a waiting room.

701
02:42:06,606 --> 02:42:10,564
- What time is it?
- 11.

702
02:42:10,689 --> 02:42:15,356
At the latest... 11 or 12.

703
02:42:18,023 --> 02:42:20,523
Who's taken my wine?

704
02:42:20,648 --> 02:42:22,481
You spilled it.

705
02:42:23,523 --> 02:42:27,190
- You're a liar, fool.
- You spilled it.

706
02:42:28,689 --> 02:42:31,357
Then get me another one.

707
02:42:39,357 --> 02:42:41,607
What's that smell?

708
02:42:41,732 --> 02:42:44,066
There wasn't one a minute ago.

709
02:42:46,190 --> 02:42:49,275
Just the spiders

710
02:42:49,399 --> 02:42:52,816
or the coal.

711
02:42:52,941 --> 02:42:54,441
No.

712
02:43:23,277 --> 02:43:25,527
It's the earth.

713
02:43:47,028 --> 02:43:56,611
Unravelling

714
02:44:44,030 --> 02:44:45,614
Come on.

715
02:47:50,290 --> 02:47:52,290
Give me the money.

716
02:48:28,166 --> 02:48:30,207
See, with the knot upwards...

717
02:48:38,292 --> 02:48:40,625
Are you sure the moneystalk
starts sprouting in four days?

718
02:48:40,750 --> 02:48:45,333
Sure. But only if you give
it enough water every day.

719
02:48:48,543 --> 02:48:51,543
- We're going to be rich?
- Sure.

720
02:48:56,543 --> 02:49:00,209
- The others will envy us?
- Of course.

721
02:49:05,959 --> 02:49:08,626
I can stay in the
best room that night?

722
02:49:08,751 --> 02:49:10,252
Yes.

723
02:49:11,876 --> 02:49:14,127
Here, take that home.

724
02:51:16,465 --> 02:51:19,300
Hi. Come on in.

725
02:51:19,925 --> 02:51:21,508
What's up?

726
02:51:58,427 --> 02:52:02,468
Where is your place?
Stay right there.

727
02:52:02,593 --> 02:52:04,843
Behave yourself.

728
03:02:26,374 --> 03:02:29,208
You've made a mess in your pants.

729
03:02:46,209 --> 03:02:48,459
You have a lot of nerve.

730
03:03:30,169 --> 03:03:33,169
I can do whatever I want to you.

731
03:03:54,588 --> 03:03:56,838
I'm stronger than you are.

732
03:04:35,922 --> 03:04:37,755
Come on now.

733
03:04:44,465 --> 03:04:46,298
Come on.

734
03:05:11,758 --> 03:05:14,925
You're dead! I won't
feel sorry for you.

735
03:05:28,883 --> 03:05:32,468
So come on, then. Come on.

736
03:07:14,513 --> 03:07:17,097
See you soon.

737
03:20:50,220 --> 03:20:52,054
Sanyi!

738
03:20:55,971 --> 03:21:00,221
Sanyi, come here! The
moneystalk's been robbed.

739
03:21:00,346 --> 03:21:04,013
- Oh, come on.
- The money's been stolen, too.

740
03:21:04,138 --> 03:21:07,347
It wasn't stolen, I needed
it. It was for me anyway.

741
03:21:07,472 --> 03:21:11,514
- It was my money, too.
- Oh, go away.

742
03:21:11,639 --> 03:21:15,472
- Why? Did you know?
- Get your hands off me!

743
03:21:15,597 --> 03:21:18,930
Go away now. I said go away!

744
03:21:19,055 --> 03:21:21,223
I won't say it again.

745
03:21:25,930 --> 03:21:29,680
Come back here. I said, come back!

746
03:21:32,930 --> 03:21:34,765
I said, come here!

747
03:21:37,056 --> 03:21:39,556
Come on, move it!

748
03:21:54,307 --> 03:21:57,724
Rat poison. You
stole it, didn't you?

749
03:21:57,849 --> 03:21:59,474
You stole it.

750
03:21:59,599 --> 03:22:02,892
And you have the whole
house exterminated, right?

751
03:22:03,016 --> 03:22:06,141
Now, here, but be careful,
I'll have my eye on you.

752
03:22:06,266 --> 03:22:08,808
And now clear off.

753
03:22:08,933 --> 03:22:11,517
I said, clear off.

754
03:28:52,452 --> 03:28:55,370
- Doctor!
- What do you want?

755
03:28:55,494 --> 03:28:57,912
- Doctor!
- What do you want?

756
03:28:58,037 --> 03:29:01,037
- Doctor!
- Let me go. Little brat!

757
03:29:02,537 --> 03:29:04,370
Fucking hell!

758
03:29:11,746 --> 03:29:13,579
What the hell do you want?

759
03:29:15,454 --> 03:29:17,829
Come on, tell me.

760
03:29:17,954 --> 03:29:19,954
What do you want?

761
03:29:23,871 --> 03:29:25,871
Where are you going? Stop
now. I won't hurt you.

762
03:29:25,996 --> 03:29:27,829
Stop!

763
03:29:29,580 --> 03:29:31,913
I won't do you any harm!

764
03:35:53,724 --> 03:35:58,016
<i>"Yes," she said to herself softly.</i>

765
03:35:58,141 --> 03:36:02,308
<i>The angels see this and understand.</i>

766
03:36:02,433 --> 03:36:06,516
<i>She felt peace inside, and
around her the trees, the road,</i>

767
03:36:06,642 --> 03:36:11,642
<i>the rain and the night
all breathed tranquillity.</i>

768
03:36:12,850 --> 03:36:16,559
<i>Everything that happens
is good, she thought.</i>

769
03:36:16,684 --> 03:36:19,892
<i>Everything was, eventually, simple.</i>

770
03:36:21,184 --> 03:36:23,934
<i>She recalled the previous day,</i>

771
03:36:24,059 --> 03:36:28,476
<i>and, smiling, she realised
how things are connected.</i>

772
03:36:29,393 --> 03:36:34,560
<i>She felt that these events
aren't connected by accident,</i>

773
03:36:34,685 --> 03:36:39,768
<i>but there's an indescribably
beautiful meaning bridging them.</i>

774
03:36:41,185 --> 03:36:45,102
<i>And she knew she wasn't alone,
for all things and people,</i>

775
03:36:45,226 --> 03:36:49,310
<i>her father up there, her
mother, her brothers, the doctor,</i>

776
03:36:49,435 --> 03:36:54,352
<i>the cat, these acacias,
this muddy road, this sky,</i>

777
03:36:54,476 --> 03:36:57,935
<i>this night down
here depended on her,</i>

778
03:36:58,061 --> 03:37:01,519
<i>just as she herself
depended on everything.</i>

779
03:37:02,727 --> 03:37:05,436
<i>She had no reason to be worried.</i>

780
03:37:05,561 --> 03:37:09,477
<i>She knew well that her angels
had set out to collect her.</i>

781
03:37:58,397 --> 03:38:08,480
<i>The Work of the Spider ll
(The Devil's Tit, Satantango)</i>

782
03:38:09,190 --> 03:38:12,647
I was plodding and plodding,
just plodding along.

783
03:38:12,772 --> 03:38:16,689
The Steigerwald kids and
Hochan the butcher, the girls,

784
03:38:16,814 --> 03:38:21,315
as they jumped like grasshoppers
when Irimiás hugged me

785
03:38:21,440 --> 03:38:24,398
and asked, "How's
it going, Kelemen?"

786
03:38:24,523 --> 03:38:29,065
and bought a round
and told me everything,

787
03:38:29,190 --> 03:38:31,148
and they were drinking rum liqueur,

788
03:38:31,273 --> 03:38:34,315
even then I was
plodding and plodding

789
03:38:34,440 --> 03:38:37,066
and plodding and plodding along.

790
03:38:37,191 --> 03:38:41,482
They'll be here. They'll
be here in the yard.

791
03:38:41,606 --> 03:38:45,732
They'll be here. The Tóth kid,

792
03:38:45,857 --> 03:38:47,607
Irimiás...

793
03:38:49,607 --> 03:38:52,524
...and they've been
to the Steigerwalds.

794
03:38:52,650 --> 03:38:59,191
And as I was plodding
along, when it became clear

795
03:38:59,316 --> 03:39:05,650
they were leaving for the
yard, then I knew everything.

796
03:39:05,775 --> 03:39:10,775
Irimiés and Petrina were
coming toward the yard.

797
03:39:10,900 --> 03:39:18,067
I met Hochan the butcher and
I bumped into the Tóth kid.

798
03:39:18,192 --> 03:39:21,818
And as I was plodding along,

799
03:39:21,943 --> 03:39:24,526
for I had to plod...

800
03:39:25,776 --> 03:39:29,235
...and saw them by the road,

801
03:39:29,359 --> 03:39:36,277
revelation which
way... why... where to

802
03:39:36,402 --> 03:39:42,235
and the plodding, the why,
the where to and the which way,

803
03:39:42,360 --> 03:39:47,527
the Tóth kid, the Steigerwald kids,

804
03:39:47,652 --> 03:39:50,945
Irimiás and Petrina

805
03:39:51,070 --> 03:39:53,903
and the gunpowder
at the Steigerwald's.

806
03:39:56,694 --> 03:39:59,986
And the Steigerwald kids
talking about gunpowder,

807
03:40:00,111 --> 03:40:03,820
and me plodding and plodding...

808
03:40:03,945 --> 03:40:06,903
And the Steigerwald kids
were talking about gunpowder.

809
03:40:07,028 --> 03:40:09,945
And the Steigerwald kids,
talking about gunpowder...

810
03:40:13,361 --> 03:40:16,821
But the Tóth kid,

811
03:40:16,946 --> 03:40:20,196
he was there... at
the Weighing bridge.

812
03:40:21,320 --> 03:40:23,904
- Put some soda in it.
- I've already put some in.

813
03:40:24,029 --> 03:40:27,696
- And the Steigerwald kids...
- A bottle of wine.

814
03:40:27,821 --> 03:40:32,362
Gunpowder's not gun-powder. They
were talking about gunpowder.

815
03:40:32,488 --> 03:40:35,862
- Careful or it goes to your
head. - Not gun-powder, gunpowder.

816
03:40:35,987 --> 03:40:38,405
I was plodding, plodding along...

817
03:40:38,530 --> 03:40:44,530
Gunpowder's not gun-powder!
Gunpowder! It's not gun-powder!

818
03:40:44,655 --> 03:40:49,613
He hugged me... The waitresses
jumped like grasshoppers...

819
03:40:49,738 --> 03:40:51,947
They were drinking rum and liqueur.

820
03:40:52,072 --> 03:40:55,198
I know I shouldn't drink any more
because it will go to my head.

821
03:40:55,323 --> 03:40:58,114
I was plodding, plodding along...

822
03:40:58,239 --> 03:41:00,863
You're offering it so invitingly.

823
03:41:00,988 --> 03:41:03,823
Just goes straight to your head!
You're pissed to the eyeballs.

824
03:41:03,947 --> 03:41:08,073
As you plod along
you learn everything.

825
03:41:08,198 --> 03:41:14,115
Don't fucking give her another!
Can't you see the state of her?

826
03:41:14,240 --> 03:41:19,698
I shouldn't drink. When I do,
I keep thinking of coffins.

827
03:41:19,824 --> 03:41:24,074
...the Steigerwald's
and Irimiás hugged me,

828
03:41:24,199 --> 03:41:28,032
the girls jumped like grasshoppers,

829
03:41:28,157 --> 03:41:31,074
and bought a round,
drinking rum and liqueur

830
03:41:31,199 --> 03:41:34,783
and he told me everything
and I'm plodding, plodding,

831
03:41:34,908 --> 03:41:38,199
plodding, plodding, and plodding,

832
03:41:38,324 --> 03:41:41,241
plodding and
plodding, and plodding.

833
03:41:41,365 --> 03:41:43,783
But there's a huge
difference between plodding

834
03:41:43,908 --> 03:41:45,991
and plodding along.

835
03:41:46,116 --> 03:41:52,366
I knew exactly when I
saw them at the junction,

836
03:41:52,492 --> 03:41:57,576
why, how, which way, why and how...

837
03:41:57,701 --> 03:42:02,826
I'm plodding, plodding,
plodding, and how am I plodding?

838
03:42:02,951 --> 03:42:04,826
How am I plodding?

839
03:42:04,951 --> 03:42:09,326
The gunpowder, the
Steigerwalds, the Tóth kid...

840
03:42:09,451 --> 03:42:17,285
The whole street was talking,
that they're hiding gunpowder.

841
03:42:17,410 --> 03:42:21,076
Why did they do this? And
why are they coming here?

842
03:42:21,202 --> 03:42:24,909
I know why they're coming
because I had a revelation...

843
03:42:25,034 --> 03:42:29,368
It's too hot in here.
János, please do something.

844
03:42:29,493 --> 03:42:31,702
You don't begrudge the coal?

845
03:42:31,827 --> 03:42:36,911
They are coming at the road
junction. I know exactly why.

846
03:42:37,036 --> 03:42:41,494
Why, why and why they're
coming and why they're coming.

847
03:42:41,618 --> 03:42:46,828
- It's nice and warm in here...
- You let him, dickhead?

848
03:42:46,953 --> 03:42:51,994
What the hell you want? At least
there's something for the others.

849
03:42:52,119 --> 03:42:56,619
For I was plodding and
plodding and plodding along...

850
03:42:59,328 --> 03:43:00,578
They're coming and coming...

851
03:43:00,704 --> 03:43:03,162
- This is not a whorehouse.
- What, then?

852
03:43:03,287 --> 03:43:07,370
...coming and coming. They
stop but they're coming!

853
03:43:07,495 --> 03:43:09,329
Let's go to the mill.

854
03:43:09,454 --> 03:43:13,120
They'll get here.
In a few minutes...

855
03:43:13,245 --> 03:43:17,705
- Where the hell are you going?
- Nowhere, honey-pot, nowhere.

856
03:43:17,830 --> 03:43:20,830
I'll show you who's the honey-pot.
Just you wait and get sober.

857
03:43:20,955 --> 03:43:22,371
Nothing, nothing.

858
03:43:22,496 --> 03:43:30,331
They're coming, because I saw
them by the road. At the junction.

859
03:43:30,455 --> 03:43:31,455
Give me a shot.

860
03:43:31,580 --> 03:43:34,788
The Steigerwald kids
talked about powder.

861
03:43:34,913 --> 03:43:37,663
Irimiés and Petrina are
coming toward the yard.

862
03:43:37,788 --> 03:43:44,038
Gunpowder, Steigerwald... and
they're coming to the yard.

863
03:43:44,164 --> 03:43:47,956
They'll be here in a short while.

864
03:43:48,081 --> 03:43:50,082
We were plodding along...

865
03:43:50,206 --> 03:43:53,664
My husband is a good man,
but the alcohol, you know.

866
03:43:53,789 --> 03:43:58,165
Without that he'd be so gentle.

867
03:43:58,290 --> 03:44:01,789
He can be a blessed good
man when he wants to.

868
03:44:01,915 --> 03:44:04,789
He's a hard worker. You know that.

869
03:44:04,915 --> 03:44:07,707
He can do the work of two.

870
03:44:07,832 --> 03:44:10,082
He only has this small flaw.

871
03:44:10,207 --> 03:44:14,958
Who doesn't have one? Who doesn't?

872
03:44:15,082 --> 03:44:17,958
They're coming, plodding.
Irimiás and Petrina...

873
03:44:18,083 --> 03:44:20,083
Someone's coming!

874
03:44:56,834 --> 03:45:00,335
I was plodding, plodding,
plodding along...

875
03:45:02,917 --> 03:45:07,960
They didn't talk much.
Irimiás and Petrina...

876
03:45:08,084 --> 03:45:10,168
Good evening. A
bottle of beer, please.

877
03:45:11,001 --> 03:45:16,336
The girls jumped around
like grasshoppers.

878
03:45:17,835 --> 03:45:20,918
Irimiés hugged me.
"How's it going, Kelemen?"

879
03:45:21,044 --> 03:45:22,377
And bought us a round.

880
03:45:22,502 --> 03:45:26,377
The girls jumped around
like grasshoppers.

881
03:45:26,502 --> 03:45:31,544
And I was plodding,
plodding and plodding along.

882
03:45:31,669 --> 03:45:34,211
Have you seen my daughter?

883
03:45:34,336 --> 03:45:37,128
- Which one?
- The little one.

884
03:45:37,252 --> 03:45:39,087
Estike.

885
03:45:40,753 --> 03:45:42,087
She hasn't been here.

886
03:45:42,212 --> 03:45:45,212
Since they started toward
the yard at the junction,

887
03:45:45,337 --> 03:45:48,462
I've known everything.

888
03:45:48,586 --> 03:45:53,503
Irimiés and Petrina are
coming toward the yard.

889
03:45:53,629 --> 03:45:56,588
I met Hochan the butcher,
and bumped into the Tóth kid

890
03:45:56,713 --> 03:46:00,003
- at the Weighing Bridge.
- You know what happened?

891
03:46:00,128 --> 03:46:06,671
Yesterday evening there was
a little trouble with Halics.

892
03:46:06,796 --> 03:46:08,546
Now he doesn't even
say hello, the shithead.

893
03:46:08,671 --> 03:46:12,046
I saw them by the road...

894
03:46:12,171 --> 03:46:18,589
Revelation, which
way, why, where to...

895
03:46:19,339 --> 03:46:23,464
...and the plodding, the why and
the where to, the which way...

896
03:46:23,589 --> 03:46:29,172
I slept all day, and when
I woke up no one was there.

897
03:46:29,297 --> 03:46:31,047
The house was empty.

898
03:46:31,173 --> 03:46:36,173
No Mari, no Juli, no Sanyika.

899
03:46:39,423 --> 03:46:43,590
And plodding, plodding
and plodding...

900
03:46:43,714 --> 03:46:46,715
The Steigerwald kids were
talking about gunpowder.

901
03:46:46,839 --> 03:46:51,673
But that's all right, even the little
one has wandered off somewhere too.

902
03:46:54,924 --> 03:46:58,049
When she comes back,
she's gonna get it.

903
03:46:58,174 --> 03:47:00,174
She'll come back.

904
03:47:04,382 --> 03:47:07,257
She's not the wandering type.

905
03:47:07,382 --> 03:47:10,341
She's really not.

906
03:47:10,466 --> 03:47:14,633
...the gunpowder's
no gun-powder...

907
03:47:16,382 --> 03:47:20,049
Wandering in this
rain all night long.

908
03:47:20,174 --> 03:47:23,842
No wonder I stay in bed for days.

909
03:47:23,967 --> 03:47:28,717
The waitresses jumped
like grasshoppers.

910
03:47:28,842 --> 03:47:31,092
They were drinking
rum and liqueur...

911
03:47:31,217 --> 03:47:33,550
That's good for my stomach.

912
03:47:36,509 --> 03:47:38,676
Do you want coffee?

913
03:47:40,925 --> 03:47:43,676
Why? I'd be tossing and
turning all night long.

914
03:47:46,133 --> 03:47:49,009
Then what is it good for?

915
03:47:49,133 --> 03:47:50,634
Nothing.

916
03:47:53,343 --> 03:47:57,385
In a little while, I was
plodding and plodding...

917
03:47:57,509 --> 03:48:03,219
The Tóth kid, the Steigerwald's...
and Irimiás hugged me...

918
03:48:03,344 --> 03:48:07,094
The girls jumped like grasshoppers,

919
03:48:07,219 --> 03:48:10,135
he bought us a round,
they had rum and liqueur.

920
03:48:10,260 --> 03:48:14,427
He told me everything
and I'm plodding...

921
03:48:14,552 --> 03:48:16,385
Well, good night.

922
03:48:17,552 --> 03:48:19,970
If you happen to see any of them,

923
03:48:20,095 --> 03:48:22,677
tell them to hit the road home.

924
03:48:22,803 --> 03:48:27,053
I can't be wandering
around all night long.

925
03:48:29,095 --> 03:48:31,095
Here's the bill.

926
03:48:32,303 --> 03:48:37,220
...why, how, which
way, why and how...

927
03:48:37,345 --> 03:48:40,095
Plodding and plodding and plodding.

928
03:48:40,220 --> 03:48:42,511
And how am I plodding?

929
03:48:42,637 --> 03:48:49,179
The gunpowder, Hochan the
butcher, Steigerwald, Tóth...

930
03:48:49,304 --> 03:48:53,679
Everybody was talking
about the Steigerwald kids

931
03:48:53,804 --> 03:48:56,638
hiding gunpowder. Why?

932
03:48:58,304 --> 03:49:00,805
And why are Irimiás and
Petrina coming toward the yard?

933
03:49:00,929 --> 03:49:03,597
I know why they're coming.

934
03:49:03,722 --> 03:49:07,972
Because I had a
revelation. A revelation.

935
03:49:08,096 --> 03:49:11,555
I know why they're coming.
Because I had a revelation.

936
03:49:11,680 --> 03:49:16,722
They're coming at the
junction. I know exactly why.

937
03:49:16,847 --> 03:49:19,847
They stop but they're coming.

938
03:51:37,812 --> 03:51:41,187
Futaki, that stupid arse,

939
03:51:41,312 --> 03:51:44,145
rolls in the mud like a pig,

940
03:51:44,270 --> 03:51:47,355
then he goes out in the rain
like a sheep that has gone astray.

941
03:51:48,813 --> 03:51:50,646
Have you lost your mind?

942
03:51:53,146 --> 03:51:56,980
You do not know you are not
supposed to get wrecked in here?

943
03:52:13,064 --> 03:52:15,065
And without eating, too.

944
03:52:33,732 --> 03:52:35,565
Wash your face.

945
03:52:37,190 --> 03:52:39,024
Dry yourself.

946
03:53:16,109 --> 03:53:18,192
Do you have anything to eat?

947
03:53:19,109 --> 03:53:20,942
Milk chocolate.

948
03:53:22,192 --> 03:53:24,775
Or cheese rolls.

949
03:53:26,859 --> 03:53:29,025
Give me two cheese rolls.

950
03:53:49,194 --> 03:53:51,027
Bloody hell.

951
03:53:53,736 --> 03:53:56,319
What can't be moved, they soil.

952
03:53:57,694 --> 03:53:59,527
And foul, everything.

953
03:54:00,402 --> 03:54:04,402
I could spend my whole life
following them with a cloth.

954
03:54:05,862 --> 03:54:11,362
The legs of the table, the
window, the stove... the crates.

955
03:54:15,903 --> 03:54:20,320
The worst is that you
can't see them do it.

956
03:54:25,654 --> 03:54:28,738
If I start to watch them,

957
03:54:28,863 --> 03:54:33,446
they can feel it

958
03:54:33,571 --> 03:54:35,988
and get out of sight.

959
03:54:44,863 --> 03:54:47,405
That damn Swabian

960
03:54:47,530 --> 03:54:49,364
did me in...

961
03:54:51,071 --> 03:54:53,655
...he never mentioned spiders.

962
03:54:57,447 --> 03:55:00,614
Nothing will come of nothing.

963
03:55:05,281 --> 03:55:06,697
No.

964
03:55:08,198 --> 03:55:11,198
The real threat comes
from under the ground.

965
03:55:13,490 --> 03:55:14,990
Suddenly...

966
03:55:15,615 --> 03:55:20,323
...one's frightened by
the silence, doesn't move,

967
03:55:20,448 --> 03:55:23,949
crouches down in the
corner where he feels safe.

968
03:55:24,074 --> 03:55:28,324
Chewing becomes pain,
swallowing agony.

969
03:55:30,032 --> 03:55:33,449
Then all slows down and finally

970
03:55:33,574 --> 03:55:36,491
comes the most terrible thing.

971
03:55:36,617 --> 03:55:38,617
Stillness.

972
03:55:40,032 --> 03:55:42,867
There's no help or escape.

973
03:55:44,617 --> 03:55:48,157
Because who can understand?

974
03:55:48,282 --> 03:55:51,492
That I, who could live
till the end of time,

975
03:55:51,617 --> 03:55:57,867
I'd still have to go away from
here all the way down to the worms.

976
03:55:57,992 --> 03:56:00,242
And now there's Irimiás coming.

977
03:56:01,033 --> 03:56:02,700
Irimiés?

978
03:56:03,618 --> 03:56:06,158
He's been drinking
on the house for weeks

979
03:56:06,284 --> 03:56:09,158
and he has the bloody
nerve to come back here.

980
03:56:09,284 --> 03:56:13,243
Because, OK, he said, I
should plant onions everywhere.

981
03:56:13,368 --> 03:56:15,118
And it succeeded.

982
03:56:15,243 --> 03:56:18,076
Because the great
ideas are always simple.

983
03:56:19,285 --> 03:56:22,868
But it's a bit too much
that afterward he comes back

984
03:56:22,993 --> 03:56:26,035
and says that I owe him everything.

985
03:56:26,160 --> 03:56:29,327
And for weeks he's
been boozing for free.

986
03:56:33,119 --> 03:56:36,077
And he has the nerve to come
back to take what's mine.

987
03:56:36,202 --> 03:56:38,619
Everything here is mine.

988
03:56:43,870 --> 03:56:46,786
Because I have done
everything here.

989
03:56:51,495 --> 03:56:54,745
Do they think they
can do anything here?

990
03:56:55,911 --> 03:56:59,621
They come in from
the street and say,

991
03:56:59,746 --> 03:57:01,912
"You can go now!"

992
03:57:09,121 --> 03:57:12,954
There will be law and order
here, my friend, in this country!

993
03:57:13,079 --> 03:57:17,079
There will be order here one
clay! There will be order!

994
04:08:01,778 --> 04:08:05,111
You see, here's Halics!

995
04:08:28,862 --> 04:08:31,029
May I have a tango?

996
04:08:39,780 --> 04:08:42,780
Do you know that
dancing is my soft spot?

997
04:09:17,115 --> 04:09:19,948
You're not like the others.

998
04:09:36,658 --> 04:09:42,658
You need a settled, sober man...

999
04:09:43,741 --> 04:09:46,158
...not a Schmidt...

1000
04:09:58,450 --> 04:10:02,700
...whose rough character

1001
04:10:02,825 --> 04:10:07,075
does not agree with
your tender personality.

1002
04:10:19,868 --> 04:10:21,618
Listen.

1003
04:10:25,368 --> 04:10:28,785
If those most excellent people

1004
04:10:28,910 --> 04:10:34,411
can again occupy the positions
they deserve in the offices...

1005
04:10:37,911 --> 04:10:41,661
...and I am the
schoolmaster again...

1006
04:10:44,161 --> 04:10:50,161
...I would take you to the city...

1007
04:11:33,913 --> 04:11:38,497
Tango is my life.
Tango, tango, tango!

1008
04:11:41,079 --> 04:11:42,289
My mother's the sea.

1009
04:11:45,123 --> 04:11:46,580
My father's the earth.

1010
04:11:47,872 --> 04:11:51,206
My name is tango... tango... tango.

1011
04:11:53,914 --> 04:11:55,747
My father's the sea.

1012
04:12:11,999 --> 04:12:13,498
Tango...

1013
04:12:18,416 --> 04:12:21,957
...is my life, tango.

1014
04:12:31,875 --> 04:12:33,875
My father's the sea.

1015
04:12:35,792 --> 04:12:38,416
My mother's the earth.

1016
04:12:38,542 --> 04:12:40,374
Never mind.

1017
04:12:40,500 --> 04:12:42,917
...is my life...

1018
04:12:44,125 --> 04:12:45,875
Tango.

1019
04:12:49,125 --> 04:12:50,833
Tango!

1020
04:12:51,418 --> 04:12:53,167
Tango...

1021
04:13:05,876 --> 04:13:07,876
...is my life...

1022
04:13:13,626 --> 04:13:15,127
Tango!

1023
04:13:22,544 --> 04:13:27,544
My mother's the sea and
my father's the earth.

1024
04:13:33,710 --> 04:13:37,961
No sea, no land either...

1025
04:13:39,295 --> 04:13:41,627
Fuck you.

1026
04:13:43,753 --> 04:13:49,170
What have you done to
the sea, to the land?

1027
04:13:53,253 --> 04:13:55,921
Is my life,

1028
04:13:57,295 --> 04:13:58,796
...tango...

1029
04:14:00,504 --> 04:14:04,171
...tango, tango?

1030
04:14:05,754 --> 04:14:10,004
My mother's the sea...

1031
04:19:33,937 --> 04:19:35,437
That was all.

1032
04:20:56,232 --> 04:20:59,483
<i>Drawn out by the tender
sound of the accordion</i>

1033
04:20:59,608 --> 04:21:03,775
<i>the spiders in the pub
launched their last attack.</i>

1034
04:21:03,900 --> 04:21:05,775
<i>They sewed loose webs</i>

1035
04:21:05,900 --> 04:21:09,359
<i>on top of the glasses,
the cups, the ashtrays,</i>

1036
04:21:09,483 --> 04:21:12,608
<i>around the legs of the
tables and the chairs.</i>

1037
04:21:12,733 --> 04:21:16,484
<i>Then they bound them
together with secret threads</i>

1038
04:21:16,609 --> 04:21:21,193
<i>so that in their hidden corners</i>

1039
04:21:21,318 --> 04:21:25,526
<i>they'd notice every little
move and every little stir</i>

1040
04:21:25,651 --> 04:21:31,110
<i>until this almost invisible
web would not be damaged.</i>

1041
04:21:31,235 --> 04:21:35,235
<i>They sewed a web on the sleeper's
faces, their feet, their hands.</i>

1042
04:21:35,360 --> 04:21:38,526
<i>Then hurried back to
their hiding places,</i>

1043
04:21:38,651 --> 04:21:42,485
<i>waiting for an
ethereal thread to move,</i>

1044
04:21:42,610 --> 04:21:44,527
<i>to start it all again.</i>

1045
04:21:45,818 --> 04:21:52,402
INTERMISSION

1046
04:21:53,611 --> 04:22:03,527
Irimiás makes a speech

1047
04:23:25,366 --> 04:23:27,866
I am in a state of deep emotion.

1048
04:23:28,741 --> 04:23:32,074
As you can imagine,
I am totally confused.

1049
04:23:33,949 --> 04:23:38,742
I am bewildered and shocked.

1050
04:23:40,033 --> 04:23:42,867
Yet I must pull myself together.

1051
04:23:44,282 --> 04:23:48,242
Though right now
all I can say is that

1052
04:23:48,367 --> 04:23:52,325
I share in this
broken-hearted mother's misery.

1053
04:23:53,950 --> 04:23:58,368
In a mother's never-ending
mourning and sorrow.

1054
04:23:59,659 --> 04:24:04,117
In the grief of losing the one
who is dearest to our hearts.

1055
04:24:05,659 --> 04:24:09,118
This tragic event weighs
us all down with sadness.

1056
04:24:09,243 --> 04:24:13,534
I don't think there's anyone
who would disagree with me.

1057
04:24:16,576 --> 04:24:21,909
And now the hardest thing is,

1058
04:24:22,034 --> 04:24:24,702
in this sadness with
our teeth clenched,

1059
04:24:24,826 --> 04:24:28,994
to get our minds
over the heartbreak,

1060
04:24:29,119 --> 04:24:34,285
to defy our tears when
our voices fail us.

1061
04:24:34,410 --> 04:24:38,995
For, and I would like to
call your attention to this,

1062
04:24:39,120 --> 04:24:43,161
nothing can be more important
than for us to reconstruct

1063
04:24:43,286 --> 04:24:50,286
the shocking events which
led to the terrible death

1064
04:24:50,411 --> 04:24:53,829
of an innocent child...

1065
04:24:55,912 --> 04:25:00,161
...before the police
start investigating.

1066
04:25:02,162 --> 04:25:04,871
You'd better expect that
the inspectors from town

1067
04:25:04,996 --> 04:25:09,579
will try to make us primarily
responsible for this awful event.

1068
04:25:10,746 --> 04:25:14,079
Yes, my friends, they're
going to blame us.

1069
04:25:14,204 --> 04:25:16,871
Because, to be quite honest...

1070
04:25:18,287 --> 04:25:23,455
...with a little caution,
care and attention,

1071
04:25:23,580 --> 04:25:25,913
we could have prevented it.

1072
04:25:28,497 --> 04:25:31,913
Just imagine this
vulnerable creature

1073
04:25:32,038 --> 04:25:35,373
wandering all night
long in the pouring rain,

1074
04:25:35,497 --> 04:25:38,539
at the mercy of the first
passer-by, of the first tramp,

1075
04:25:38,663 --> 04:25:40,289
of anybody.

1076
04:25:41,123 --> 04:25:45,373
She was whipped by
the wind all night,

1077
04:25:45,498 --> 04:25:48,831
she fell easy prey to the elements.

1078
04:25:48,955 --> 04:25:54,623
She must have been around here,
wondering here all the time.

1079
04:25:54,748 --> 04:25:57,082
She may have looked
in through this window

1080
04:25:57,207 --> 04:26:02,539
and saw that you were all
drunk and dancing around.

1081
04:26:06,290 --> 04:26:10,874
Don't get me wrong, I don't
mean to accuse anyone personally.

1082
04:26:10,999 --> 04:26:12,582
I am not accusing the mother,

1083
04:26:12,707 --> 04:26:15,290
who is never going
to forgive herself

1084
04:26:15,415 --> 04:26:19,332
for getting up too late in
the morning of that awful day.

1085
04:26:20,332 --> 04:26:23,540
I am not accusing
the victim's brother,

1086
04:26:23,666 --> 04:26:26,666
nor any other
members of the family.

1087
04:26:26,791 --> 04:26:29,541
So I am not accusing anyone.

1088
04:26:29,666 --> 04:26:35,125
But let me ask you the question,

1089
04:26:35,250 --> 04:26:38,501
aren't we all guilty?

1090
04:26:42,291 --> 04:26:45,917
You will, of course,
answer that we are innocent.

1091
04:26:46,042 --> 04:26:50,459
But then, what do we
call this poor child?

1092
04:26:50,584 --> 04:26:53,167
The victim of the innocent?

1093
04:26:53,293 --> 04:26:55,959
The martyr of the faultless?

1094
04:26:56,084 --> 04:26:58,959
The slaughtered of the sinless?

1095
04:27:01,210 --> 04:27:04,460
I'd rather call her innocent.

1096
04:27:06,127 --> 04:27:11,127
I spent the night turning in
my bed till I realised this.

1097
04:27:13,335 --> 04:27:17,086
Not only do we not know how
the tragic event happened,

1098
04:27:17,211 --> 04:27:21,543
but we don't really even
know what exactly happened.

1099
04:27:23,003 --> 04:27:27,836
I am quite convinced that
this event was fated to happen.

1100
04:27:27,961 --> 04:27:30,961
Now you also seem to suspect that.

1101
04:27:31,753 --> 04:27:34,461
It is not enough, however,
to suspect something.

1102
04:27:34,586 --> 04:27:37,544
Things are to be understood

1103
04:27:37,669 --> 04:27:41,253
and said without delay.

1104
04:27:41,378 --> 04:27:46,254
It had been quite clear for you
before coming here, but you were

1105
04:27:46,378 --> 04:27:49,920
too afraid to say that this
yard was ruled by misfortune.

1106
04:27:50,045 --> 04:27:55,254
You didn't dare talk about
it. Now you may rightly suppose

1107
04:27:55,379 --> 04:28:00,546
an irrevocable
judgment is coming soon.

1108
04:28:02,421 --> 04:28:05,546
You are slouching
around in this decay,

1109
04:28:05,671 --> 04:28:09,421
far away from everything
that means life.

1110
04:28:09,546 --> 04:28:11,630
Your plans come to nothing,

1111
04:28:11,755 --> 04:28:15,213
your dreams, still
blind, are shattered.

1112
04:28:15,339 --> 04:28:19,171
You expect some miracle
which will never come.

1113
04:28:20,130 --> 04:28:23,921
But what kind of misfortune
are you the victims of?

1114
04:28:24,046 --> 04:28:28,381
Is it the crumbling plaster,

1115
04:28:28,506 --> 04:28:34,381
the roofs without tiles,
the crumbling walls,

1116
04:28:34,506 --> 04:28:39,257
the sour taste our friend
Futaki keeps talking about?

1117
04:28:40,589 --> 04:28:43,090
Isn't it the shattered prospects,

1118
04:28:43,215 --> 04:28:46,090
and broken dreams,

1119
04:28:46,215 --> 04:28:51,632
that bend our knees
and wear us numb?

1120
04:28:53,382 --> 04:28:58,632
Don't be surprised that I speak
harshly, but let us be honest.

1121
04:28:58,758 --> 04:29:01,298
If you felt the yard
was ruled by misfortune,

1122
04:29:01,423 --> 04:29:04,507
why didn't you try to
do something about it?

1123
04:29:04,632 --> 04:29:09,383
You thought a bird in the
hand is worth two in the bush.

1124
04:29:11,299 --> 04:29:13,383
But this is a coward's way.

1125
04:29:13,508 --> 04:29:21,174
It is disgraceful and careless
and it has serious consequences.

1126
04:29:21,299 --> 04:29:25,842
This is called impotence,
sinful impotence.

1127
04:29:25,967 --> 04:29:29,675
This is weakness, sinful weakness.

1128
04:29:29,800 --> 04:29:33,634
This is cowardice,
sinful cowardice.

1129
04:29:36,217 --> 04:29:40,800
Because, and bear this in mind,

1130
04:29:40,925 --> 04:29:44,385
it's not just to others that
we can do unforgivable things,

1131
04:29:44,510 --> 04:29:47,301
but also to ourselves.

1132
04:29:47,426 --> 04:29:51,135
And this, my friends,
is even more serious.

1133
04:29:51,260 --> 04:29:55,760
Yes, when you think about
it, all kinds of vileness

1134
04:29:55,885 --> 04:29:59,718
are sins against ourselves.

1135
04:30:01,760 --> 04:30:06,427
And you know, my
friends, if I think back

1136
04:30:06,552 --> 04:30:11,302
and see you lying half-dead
on the chairs and tables,

1137
04:30:11,427 --> 04:30:15,136
on top of each other,

1138
04:30:15,261 --> 04:30:19,677
dribbling, exhausted,

1139
04:30:19,803 --> 04:30:23,302
my heart sinks and
I cannot judge you,

1140
04:30:23,427 --> 04:30:27,594
for I will never be
able to forget this.

1141
04:30:29,137 --> 04:30:33,845
From your panting,
snoring and groaning,

1142
04:30:33,970 --> 04:30:38,638
I heard your cry for help
which I have to answer.

1143
04:30:39,679 --> 04:30:42,095
We know each other well.

1144
04:30:42,220 --> 04:30:46,178
I have been keeping my eyes
wide-open for decades everywhere.

1145
04:30:46,303 --> 04:30:47,638
I bitterly observe that,

1146
04:30:47,763 --> 04:30:51,846
under the thick veil of
trickery and deception,

1147
04:30:51,971 --> 04:30:53,179
nothing has changed.

1148
04:30:53,304 --> 04:30:58,054
Misery has remained misery.

1149
04:30:58,179 --> 04:31:00,430
The two extra spoonfuls
of food we can have

1150
04:31:00,555 --> 04:31:04,054
only makes the air thinner
in front of our mouths.

1151
04:31:05,430 --> 04:31:09,305
But I realised what I have
done so far is nothing.

1152
04:31:09,430 --> 04:31:12,764
A much deeper solution is needed.

1153
04:31:12,889 --> 04:31:16,930
So, using the opportunity,

1154
04:31:17,055 --> 04:31:19,389
I decided...

1155
04:31:21,223 --> 04:31:23,639
...to get some people together

1156
04:31:23,764 --> 04:31:28,723
and set up a model farm, which
will ensure a stable living,

1157
04:31:28,847 --> 04:31:33,473
and bind this tiny group of
the dispossessed together.

1158
04:31:33,598 --> 04:31:36,932
I am creating an island

1159
04:31:37,056 --> 04:31:39,306
where no one is powerless,

1160
04:31:39,431 --> 04:31:43,431
where everyone will live in peace,

1161
04:31:43,556 --> 04:31:46,807
and will feel safe as human beings.

1162
04:31:46,932 --> 04:31:51,099
That is why I left
for the manor in Almás.

1163
04:31:51,224 --> 04:31:53,099
The main building
is in good condition,

1164
04:31:53,224 --> 04:31:56,266
the rental agreement
is a simple matter.

1165
04:31:56,391 --> 04:31:58,557
There's just one problem...

1166
04:31:59,307 --> 04:32:01,516
...no use in trying to
keep it a secret from you...

1167
04:32:02,516 --> 04:32:04,017
...the money.

1168
04:32:04,141 --> 04:32:07,558
Without a penny, the
whole thing is dead.

1169
04:32:08,391 --> 04:32:13,100
Capital is needed for production,
but this is a bit complicated.

1170
04:32:13,225 --> 04:32:15,725
There's no point in
going into details.

1171
04:32:18,308 --> 04:32:22,393
And you'll understand that the
circumstances of our meeting

1172
04:32:22,518 --> 04:32:27,934
made me feel uncertain, whether
you would be able to do it.

1173
04:32:28,058 --> 04:32:34,476
Whether you would be able
to offer the little money,

1174
04:32:34,601 --> 04:32:39,394
the result of your extra
hard work and much hardship,

1175
04:32:39,518 --> 04:32:43,018
to hand over for a hasty idea.

1176
04:32:43,144 --> 04:32:45,893
Think about it.

1177
04:32:46,018 --> 04:32:50,435
Calm your thoughts. Do
not decide straight away.

1178
04:32:51,310 --> 04:32:53,852
But if fate decides

1179
04:32:53,977 --> 04:32:57,269
that from now on we stay together,

1180
04:32:57,394 --> 04:33:00,020
inseparable,

1181
04:33:00,145 --> 04:33:03,477
do remember the price
that has been paid.

1182
04:33:03,602 --> 04:33:06,602
Do not forget the child...

1183
04:33:09,560 --> 04:33:14,561
...who may have had to
perish for the very reason

1184
04:33:14,687 --> 04:33:18,520
so our star could finally rise.

1185
04:33:20,771 --> 04:33:23,604
Who knows, my friends?

1186
04:33:26,604 --> 04:33:28,604
All we know for certain is...

1187
04:33:30,395 --> 04:33:33,396
...that life is very hard on us.

1188
04:35:51,944 --> 04:36:01,779
The Perspective, as
seen from the front

1189
04:36:29,905 --> 04:36:34,321
I told you she shouldn't have
been taken from the institute.

1190
04:36:53,030 --> 04:36:55,697
I don't know why
you brought her out.

1191
04:39:54,331 --> 04:39:56,706
Friends,

1192
04:39:56,831 --> 04:39:58,748
words fail me

1193
04:39:58,874 --> 04:40:03,123
now that I let you go on your way.

1194
04:40:04,540 --> 04:40:07,415
It's hard to describe
the way I feel.

1195
04:40:07,540 --> 04:40:11,540
For what could I say...

1196
04:40:12,374 --> 04:40:17,124
...of your enthusiasm,
your generosity...

1197
04:40:18,916 --> 04:40:21,916
...for the sake of
our common prosperity?

1198
04:40:23,082 --> 04:40:27,708
Of that precious thing you gave me,

1199
04:40:27,833 --> 04:40:29,792
your confidence.

1200
04:40:29,917 --> 04:40:32,332
What else could I say

1201
04:40:32,457 --> 04:40:36,167
but that all this gives me courage
and lays a special responsibility on me

1202
04:40:36,292 --> 04:40:40,958
which I would like to fulfil
to the best of my ability.

1203
04:40:43,543 --> 04:40:46,167
Your enthusiasm and confidence

1204
04:40:46,292 --> 04:40:49,793
makes me confident
and enthusiastic.

1205
04:40:52,418 --> 04:40:54,668
I'm thinking of the
future we'll share.

1206
04:40:55,751 --> 04:40:57,626
Goodbye, my friends.

1207
04:40:59,418 --> 04:41:03,418
See you tomorrow at 6am
in the manor at Almás.

1208
04:41:05,169 --> 04:41:08,419
Go ahead and think of the future.

1209
04:41:11,127 --> 04:41:15,544
From now on you, my
friends, are free.

1210
04:42:11,297 --> 04:42:15,672
And you were screwed,
you mean shitbag!

1211
04:42:15,797 --> 04:42:19,172
Fuck off! Bastards.

1212
04:42:19,297 --> 04:42:22,463
Go fuck yourselves. Fuck off!

1213
04:42:22,588 --> 04:42:24,588
Fuck off!

1214
04:42:35,214 --> 04:42:37,048
Fuck off!

1215
04:43:14,133 --> 04:43:17,424
You see, what you have done?
The stuck-up person you were.

1216
04:43:17,550 --> 04:43:22,133
- Keep your mouth shut, OK?
- There you are.

1217
04:43:26,551 --> 04:43:30,133
Stop crowing and go
to hell. Just go home.

1218
04:43:30,258 --> 04:43:33,133
- Oh, yes, once up and once down.
- Go home, will you?

1219
04:43:33,258 --> 04:43:36,759
I've been saying, one always
has to have respect for one self.

1220
04:43:36,884 --> 04:43:41,176
Now you're finished.
You can close down.

1221
04:43:41,302 --> 04:43:43,801
Go home, will you?

1222
04:43:43,926 --> 04:43:45,427
Leave me alone.

1223
04:43:45,551 --> 04:43:48,842
My husband was the same, he
didn't know what was right.

1224
04:43:48,967 --> 04:43:53,385
And where did he end up?
Swinging from a rope in the barn.

1225
04:43:55,510 --> 04:44:00,843
Go home, stop bothering
me. Bother about yourself.

1226
04:44:08,219 --> 04:44:11,969
Go get your daughters instead
or they might go with them too.

1227
04:44:13,928 --> 04:44:17,303
- They'll never. They're locked up.
- Pay for your drinks and go.

1228
04:44:17,428 --> 04:44:19,844
They won't leave
me like Estike did.

1229
04:44:21,594 --> 04:44:25,136
When they leave the yard,
they'll go and dig the ground.

1230
04:44:25,261 --> 04:44:26,929
Go home now.

1231
04:44:27,887 --> 04:44:29,303
Go.

1232
04:44:45,429 --> 04:44:47,262
Now, just go, go.

1233
04:52:02,992 --> 04:52:07,576
- You've finished it?
- I do not want to leave it for the gypsies.

1234
04:53:07,662 --> 04:53:11,788
<i>The wind is blowing the clouds</i>

1235
04:53:11,912 --> 04:53:16,162
<i>Behind the sky is burning</i>

1236
04:53:16,287 --> 04:53:20,788
<i>Give me, my dear, your little hand</i>

1237
04:53:20,913 --> 04:53:25,163
<i>God knows if I'll see you again</i>

1238
04:53:25,289 --> 04:53:29,163
<i>Whether I'll hold you in my arms</i>

1239
04:53:29,289 --> 04:53:33,788
<i>Whether I'll kiss you, dear</i>

1240
04:53:33,913 --> 04:53:41,996
<i>God only knows the
day I'll be shipped out</i>

1241
04:53:42,581 --> 04:53:46,622
<i>Whether I'll hold you...</i>

1242
04:54:51,625 --> 04:54:57,210
<i>You're lovely, you're fair, Hungary</i>

1243
04:56:02,088 --> 04:56:05,796
Folks. We forgot the doctor.

1244
04:56:05,921 --> 04:56:08,004
Never mind the doctor.

1245
04:56:10,921 --> 04:56:14,255
He would have surely come but
I didn't mention it to him.

1246
04:56:17,755 --> 04:56:20,839
Come on, he would not be able
to last this long journey.

1247
04:56:22,755 --> 04:56:24,964
But he's going to starve now.

1248
04:56:25,088 --> 04:56:28,672
He can't even arrange
it with the pub owner.

1249
04:56:30,005 --> 04:56:32,005
Then let him starve to death.

1250
04:56:37,465 --> 04:56:44,631
I don't care about the doctor, if
you miss him so much, go back for him.

1251
04:56:54,590 --> 04:56:57,924
I haven't seen him for months.

1252
04:56:58,049 --> 04:57:00,631
There's no need to cry over him.

1253
04:57:02,091 --> 04:57:08,341
He's fine. Gets pissed every
day, then goes off to snore.

1254
04:57:13,758 --> 04:57:17,758
I wouldn't mind feeling his
mother's share in my pocket.

1255
04:57:39,759 --> 04:57:41,259
Are we all here?

1256
04:57:42,384 --> 04:57:44,968
No one's lagging behind?

1257
04:58:57,347 --> 04:58:59,347
We've done it!

1258
04:59:00,221 --> 04:59:02,638
At least we've done it.

1259
04:59:56,725 --> 05:00:00,975
You've come well prepared
for this new life.

1260
05:00:01,100 --> 05:00:04,266
Come on, Lajos, there
will be lots more of that.

1261
05:07:52,706 --> 05:07:56,706
How could those poor
fellows heat all this?

1262
05:18:43,738 --> 05:18:49,572
Didn't I tell you? We
should never lose heart.

1263
05:18:50,656 --> 05:18:55,572
We have to have trust
until our last breath.

1264
05:18:55,697 --> 05:18:59,531
Otherwise what would become of us?

1265
05:18:59,656 --> 05:19:02,073
Tell me, what?

1266
05:19:06,447 --> 05:19:08,781
I can imagine.

1267
05:19:11,572 --> 05:19:14,990
You've seen the outer buildings...

1268
05:19:16,739 --> 05:19:18,907
...there's about five of them.

1269
05:19:22,073 --> 05:19:25,741
I bet the workshops
are going to be there?

1270
05:19:32,532 --> 05:19:36,866
Workshops? What workshops?

1271
05:19:39,534 --> 05:19:44,949
Please be quiet. My husband is
already asleep. He wants quiet.

1272
05:19:47,991 --> 05:19:52,575
All right, all right.
Can't we just talk?

1273
05:20:09,992 --> 05:20:12,909
I think it'll be
the other way round:

1274
05:20:14,660 --> 05:20:18,868
we'll live in them

1275
05:20:18,993 --> 05:20:21,410
and the workshops will be here.

1276
05:20:21,535 --> 05:20:24,952
Won't you keep quiet? No
one can get any rest here.

1277
05:20:33,660 --> 05:20:35,494
Who was that?

1278
05:20:36,994 --> 05:20:40,828
Leave me alone. It wasn't me.

1279
05:20:43,369 --> 05:20:46,369
Nobody wants to own up to it?

1280
05:20:49,662 --> 05:20:51,162
Look,

1281
05:20:51,286 --> 05:20:55,870
I'll agree to anything
you like, just keep quiet.

1282
05:21:01,995 --> 05:21:03,621
Listen,

1283
05:21:03,746 --> 05:21:08,579
if everyone works hard,
I say, just one month.

1284
05:21:12,829 --> 05:21:16,663
We have great prospects
for the future.

1285
05:21:22,079 --> 05:21:27,038
Tomorrow we'll find out what
Irimiás is planning to do.

1286
05:21:30,539 --> 05:21:32,580
Tomorrow.

1287
05:22:21,207 --> 05:22:24,999
<i>Halics was pursued by a
hunchback with a glass eye.</i>

1288
05:22:25,124 --> 05:22:28,792
<i>And after all sods of
trials he fled to a river</i>

1289
05:22:28,917 --> 05:22:31,500
<i>but he started to lose heart.</i>

1290
05:22:31,625 --> 05:22:35,291
<i>Every time he came up for air,</i>

1291
05:22:35,417 --> 05:22:39,958
<i>the little man immediately
hit his head with a long stick.</i>

1292
05:22:40,083 --> 05:22:43,250
<i>And each time he shouted,</i>

1293
05:22:43,376 --> 05:22:45,708
<i>"Now you're gonna pay for it."</i>

1294
05:22:52,793 --> 05:22:56,459
<i>The schoolmaster persuaded
a man wearing an old suit</i>

1295
05:22:56,584 --> 05:23:00,709
<i>to go with him to
somewhere he knows.</i>

1296
05:23:00,834 --> 05:23:05,169
<i>The man agreed, like
someone who can't say no.</i>

1297
05:23:05,294 --> 05:23:06,876
<i>He could hardly control himself</i>

1298
05:23:07,001 --> 05:23:09,751
<i>and when they fumed
into a deserted park,</i>

1299
05:23:09,876 --> 05:23:11,793
<i>he even pushed him</i>

1300
05:23:11,918 --> 05:23:16,627
<i>to reach faster a bench that
was surrounded by bushes.</i>

1301
05:23:16,752 --> 05:23:19,794
<i>He made the man lie
down and he jumped on him</i>

1302
05:23:19,919 --> 05:23:22,294
<i>and kissed him on the neck.</i>

1303
05:23:22,419 --> 05:23:26,669
<i>But seconds later, doctors appeared
on the path dressed in white.</i>

1304
05:23:26,795 --> 05:23:30,294
<i>Embarrassed, he waved to
them that he was going,</i>

1305
05:23:30,419 --> 05:23:34,086
<i>but he started to reproach
the confused little man,</i>

1306
05:23:34,211 --> 05:23:37,711
<i>for by then, he seemed
to hate his guts so much.</i>

1307
05:23:44,836 --> 05:23:48,546
<i>The ground trembled
under Schmidt's feet,</i>

1308
05:23:48,671 --> 05:23:51,962
<i>as if he was walking on the moors.</i>

1309
05:23:52,087 --> 05:23:54,879
<i>He climbed up into a tree,</i>

1310
05:23:55,004 --> 05:23:59,004
<i>but he felt it
starting to sink too.</i>

1311
05:24:00,379 --> 05:24:01,712
<i>Then he was lying on the bed,</i>

1312
05:24:01,837 --> 05:24:04,754
<i>trying to get the
nightgown off his wife.</i>

1313
05:24:04,879 --> 05:24:07,380
<i>But she started to yell,</i>

1314
05:24:07,505 --> 05:24:11,422
<i>he jumped after her,
the nightgown was torn.</i>

1315
05:24:11,547 --> 05:24:15,463
<i>She turned towards him and laughed</i>

1316
05:24:15,588 --> 05:24:18,255
<i>and the nipples on
her enormous breasts</i>

1317
05:24:18,380 --> 05:24:21,380
<i>were like two beautiful roses.</i>

1318
05:24:48,589 --> 05:24:51,257
<i>Mrs Halics was washing
Mrs Schmidt's back,</i>

1319
05:24:51,381 --> 05:24:57,631
<i>and the rosary on the rim of the tub
slipped into the water like a snake.</i>

1320
05:24:57,757 --> 05:25:00,340
<i>Mrs Schmidt said she had enough,</i>

1321
05:25:00,465 --> 05:25:02,924
<i>that her skin was
burning from the scrubbing</i>

1322
05:25:03,049 --> 05:25:05,132
<i>but Mrs Hal/cs pushed
her back into the bath</i>

1323
05:25:05,257 --> 05:25:08,716
<i>and went on scrubbing her back
because she said she was afraid</i>

1324
05:25:08,841 --> 05:25:11,841
<i>that Mrs Schmidt wouldn't
be satisfied with her.</i>

1325
05:25:31,050 --> 05:25:34,384
<i>Mrs Kráner heard a
noise from outside</i>

1326
05:25:34,509 --> 05:25:37,426
<i>but she didn't know
what it could be.</i>

1327
05:25:37,551 --> 05:25:42,509
<i>She put on a fur coat and
left for the engine shed.</i>

1328
05:25:42,634 --> 05:25:46,884
<i>She had almost reached the
road when she had a bad feeling.</i>

1329
05:25:47,009 --> 05:25:52,177
<i>She turned and saw that the
top of their house was on fire.</i>

1330
05:25:52,302 --> 05:25:56,593
<i>"The chopped wood. Christ,
I left the chopped wood out!</i>

1331
05:25:56,718 --> 05:26:00,927
<i>"Heavens!" she
screamed, and ran back.</i>

1332
05:26:01,052 --> 05:26:07,635
<i>Kráner was sitting at
the table, calmly eating.</i>

1333
05:26:08,510 --> 05:26:13,053
<i>"Jéska, are you crazy?
The house is on fire!"</i>

1334
05:26:13,178 --> 05:26:16,344
<i>But Kráner didn't move.</i>

1335
05:26:23,886 --> 05:26:29,261
<i>Mrs Schmidt was a bird, flying
over the clouds, happily.</i>

1336
05:26:29,386 --> 05:26:32,595
<i>She saw that someone down
there was waving at her.</i>

1337
05:26:32,720 --> 05:26:36,469
<i>She came down a bit and
heard Schmidt shouting.</i>

1338
05:26:36,595 --> 05:26:40,262
<i>"Why didn't you cook anything, you
bitch? Come down here right now."</i>

1339
05:26:40,387 --> 05:26:45,513
<i>But she flew over him
and tweeted, "Tomorrow.</i>

1340
05:26:45,637 --> 05:26:48,596
<i>"You won't starve till then."</i>

1341
05:26:48,721 --> 05:26:51,346
<i>She felt the warmth
of the sun on her back,</i>

1342
05:26:51,471 --> 05:26:53,721
<i>then flew closer to the ground.</i>

1343
05:26:53,846 --> 05:26:56,930
<i>She wanted to snatch a bug.</i>

1344
05:27:01,388 --> 05:27:04,346
<i>Futaki's shoulders were
beaten with an iron bar.</i>

1345
05:27:04,471 --> 05:27:09,306
<i>He couldn't move, he
was tied to a tree.</i>

1346
05:27:09,431 --> 05:27:13,930
<i>He stretched out and
felt the rope loosen.</i>

1347
05:27:14,055 --> 05:27:18,347
<i>He looked at his shoulders
and saw a long wound,</i>

1348
05:27:18,472 --> 05:27:22,889
<i>then turned his head, as
he couldn't stand seeing it.</i>

1349
05:27:24,764 --> 05:27:26,514
<i>He was sitting on an excavator,</i>

1350
05:27:26,639 --> 05:27:30,057
<i>the shovel was scooping
out a huge hole.</i>

1351
05:27:30,182 --> 05:27:32,098
<i>A man came up to him and said,</i>

1352
05:27:32,223 --> 05:27:36,764
<i>"Hurry up, I won't give you any
more petrol, whatever you say."</i>

1353
05:27:36,890 --> 05:27:41,015
<i>But it was no use scooping,
for the earth kept falling back.</i>

1354
05:27:41,140 --> 05:27:44,473
<i>He tried again but failed.</i>

1355
05:27:45,598 --> 05:27:47,432
<i>Then he cried.</i>

1356
05:27:49,724 --> 05:27:51,808
<i>He was sitting at the
window of the engine shed</i>

1357
05:27:51,933 --> 05:27:56,557
<i>and didn't know whether
it was daybreak or evening.</i>

1358
05:27:56,683 --> 05:28:00,558
<i>The whole thing just
didn't want to end.</i>

1359
05:28:00,683 --> 05:28:03,433
<i>He was sitting, not
knowing the time of clay,</i>

1360
05:28:03,558 --> 05:28:04,974
<i>and nothing changed outside.</i>

1361
05:28:05,099 --> 05:28:07,600
<i>Morning didn't come,
night didn't fall,</i>

1362
05:28:07,724 --> 05:28:12,392
<i>day was beginning to break or
night was beginning to fall.</i>

1363
05:29:34,479 --> 05:29:44,646
Heavenly Vision? Hallucinations?

1364
05:29:47,563 --> 05:29:48,938
Friends.

1365
05:29:49,063 --> 05:29:54,272
Words fail me, now that the time
came and I let you go your own way.

1366
05:29:56,730 --> 05:29:59,397
It's hard to describe
the way I feel.

1367
05:29:59,522 --> 05:30:03,772
For what can I say

1368
05:30:03,897 --> 05:30:08,897
about your enthusiasm,
your generosity...

1369
05:30:10,355 --> 05:30:13,106
...for the sake of
our common prosperity.

1370
05:30:14,564 --> 05:30:19,231
That precious thing you gave me,

1371
05:30:19,356 --> 05:30:21,356
your confidence.

1372
05:30:22,814 --> 05:30:24,981
What else could I say but

1373
05:30:25,106 --> 05:30:28,774
that all this gives me courage,
lays great responsibility on me,

1374
05:30:28,899 --> 05:30:33,315
which I would like to
accept and do the best I can.

1375
05:30:35,648 --> 05:30:38,149
And that your
enthusiasm and confidence

1376
05:30:38,274 --> 05:30:41,857
makes me confident
and enthusiastic.

1377
05:30:43,524 --> 05:30:46,024
I'm thinking of the
future we'll share.

1378
05:30:48,441 --> 05:30:50,399
Goodbye, dear friends.

1379
05:30:50,525 --> 05:30:54,024
See you tomorrow at 6am
in the manor at Almás.

1380
05:30:54,983 --> 05:30:57,983
Go now and think of
the future we'll share.

1381
05:30:59,357 --> 05:31:03,358
From now on you are free.

1382
05:31:41,444 --> 05:31:46,735
And you are screwed,
you mean shitbag!

1383
05:31:46,861 --> 05:31:51,694
Fuck off. You bastards! Go
fuck yourselves. Fuck off!

1384
05:32:05,736 --> 05:32:09,361
I'm scared shitless, man,

1385
05:32:09,486 --> 05:32:13,612
how do we get out of this?

1386
05:32:13,737 --> 05:32:16,987
I'd be surprised if you
weren't shitting in your pants.

1387
05:32:17,111 --> 05:32:18,987
Do you want some paper?

1388
05:32:19,112 --> 05:32:23,612
This is no fucking joke,
it's bloody serious.

1389
05:32:24,904 --> 05:32:29,946
I wouldn't say I'm
bursting with laughter.

1390
05:32:30,071 --> 05:32:32,322
Stop it, will you?

1391
05:32:35,405 --> 05:32:38,987
Would you be surprised if
I said our time has come?

1392
05:32:39,987 --> 05:32:44,363
What the hell are you getting at?

1393
05:32:44,488 --> 05:32:48,280
Listen to old Petrina this time.

1394
05:32:48,405 --> 05:32:51,697
Look, let's take the first train

1395
05:32:51,822 --> 05:32:53,947
and get away from here.

1396
05:32:54,073 --> 05:32:56,448
We're going to get in big trouble

1397
05:32:56,573 --> 05:32:59,531
if they realise what's going on.

1398
05:32:59,656 --> 05:33:01,489
Shut up.

1399
05:33:10,281 --> 05:33:12,656
Don't you see that we're partisans

1400
05:33:12,781 --> 05:33:17,949
in this persistent and hopeless
fight for human dignity?

1401
05:33:22,449 --> 05:33:24,615
Petrina, our time has come.

1402
05:33:24,740 --> 05:33:26,407
Our time has come.

1403
05:33:26,532 --> 05:33:31,032
You keep saying this,
"Our time has come."

1404
05:33:31,157 --> 05:33:34,199
Our time will never come.

1405
05:33:34,324 --> 05:33:36,908
I had faith and confidence...

1406
05:33:38,365 --> 05:33:40,200
And there we are.

1407
05:33:49,866 --> 05:33:53,451
The web... don't you understand?

1408
05:33:55,283 --> 05:33:58,701
Irimiés' nationwide cobweb.

1409
05:34:00,158 --> 05:34:03,326
Is your dull mind getting clear?

1410
05:34:10,243 --> 05:34:12,909
Where something stirs...

1411
05:37:38,753 --> 05:37:40,502
Go on.

1412
05:38:06,046 --> 05:38:08,796
You've never seen
fog before or what?

1413
05:39:55,468 --> 05:39:58,718
The horses got away from
the slaughterhouse again.

1414
05:40:03,344 --> 05:40:05,510
Who do you support?

1415
05:40:09,385 --> 05:40:10,969
Myself.

1416
05:42:31,934 --> 05:42:33,767
How are you?

1417
05:42:34,392 --> 05:42:35,892
Fine.

1418
05:42:43,934 --> 05:42:48,102
You haven't changed at all.

1419
05:42:48,227 --> 05:42:50,643
What about you?

1420
05:42:50,768 --> 05:42:52,685
Nothing special.

1421
05:42:52,810 --> 05:42:54,227
I thought...

1422
05:42:54,352 --> 05:42:57,352
Two rum liqueurs
and a glass of wine.

1423
05:43:08,561 --> 05:43:10,228
Here you are.

1424
05:43:12,603 --> 05:43:14,436
Listen, drink this up.

1425
05:43:14,561 --> 05:43:18,394
Then you go see Páyer and tell
him I'm waiting for him here.

1426
05:43:46,730 --> 05:43:48,396
Steigerwald.

1427
05:43:51,563 --> 05:43:53,730
What is it now?

1428
05:43:53,855 --> 05:43:58,189
We're staying here for tonight
but I'll need the car tomorrow.

1429
05:44:04,771 --> 05:44:09,522
But then I want the
money before you go.

1430
05:44:11,940 --> 05:44:13,606
All right.

1431
05:44:31,940 --> 05:44:37,190
- And three bean soups.
- OK.

1432
05:44:39,232 --> 05:44:42,066
- With ham.
- OK.

1433
05:46:13,237 --> 05:46:15,070
I'm going to dictate.

1434
05:46:16,737 --> 05:46:18,779
Dear Captain...

1435
05:46:23,529 --> 05:46:25,529
...eternity...

1436
05:46:27,529 --> 05:46:30,363
...lasts forever...

1437
05:46:31,613 --> 05:46:37,613
...because it doesn't
compare to the ephemeral...

1438
05:46:40,197 --> 05:46:42,696
...the changeable...

1439
05:46:44,322 --> 05:46:46,071
...the temporary.

1440
05:46:51,405 --> 05:46:57,156
But the intensity of
light penetrating darkness

1441
05:46:57,280 --> 05:46:59,281
seems to weaken.

1442
05:47:01,405 --> 05:47:04,655
"Seems... to... weaken."

1443
05:47:04,780 --> 05:47:07,780
There is discontinuance...

1444
05:47:10,281 --> 05:47:11,990
...interruptions...

1445
05:47:13,490 --> 05:47:15,198
...holes...

1446
05:47:20,907 --> 05:47:23,323
...then finally the black nothing.

1447
05:47:26,199 --> 05:47:28,699
Then there are myriads of stars

1448
05:47:28,824 --> 05:47:31,241
at an unreachable distance...

1449
05:47:36,866 --> 05:47:40,449
...with a tiny spark in the middle,

1450
05:47:40,575 --> 05:47:42,407
the Ego.

1451
05:47:43,032 --> 05:47:47,867
Tiny... spark..."

1452
05:47:50,867 --> 05:47:54,575
Our deeds can be
rewarded or punished,

1453
05:47:54,700 --> 05:47:58,700
punished in eternity,
and only there...

1454
05:48:06,534 --> 05:48:12,368
...because everything has a place,
a place far away from reality...

1455
05:48:17,368 --> 05:48:21,119
...where it has its place,

1456
05:48:21,244 --> 05:48:24,077
where it has always been...

1457
05:48:24,202 --> 05:48:26,868
"Where... it... has... been..."

1458
05:48:27,619 --> 05:48:30,119
...where it will always be...

1459
05:48:32,327 --> 05:48:34,828
...where it is now.

1460
05:48:43,036 --> 05:48:45,786
The only authentic place.

1461
05:51:03,542 --> 05:51:06,335
I hope I didn't wake you.

1462
05:51:06,460 --> 05:51:10,710
You didn't disturb my sleep
and I do hope you won't either.

1463
05:51:19,460 --> 05:51:23,460
- My collaborators.
- My name's Petrina.

1464
05:51:23,585 --> 05:51:25,086
Horgos.

1465
05:51:26,128 --> 05:51:28,460
Very nice young man.

1466
05:51:30,878 --> 05:51:33,044
He can have a nice career.

1467
05:51:37,712 --> 05:51:40,544
Would you get me
something now that...

1468
05:51:41,544 --> 05:51:44,378
...you got me out of bed?

1469
05:51:45,837 --> 05:51:47,670
What would you like?

1470
05:51:48,795 --> 05:51:51,795
Don't ask me what I'd
like, they don't have it.

1471
05:51:56,212 --> 05:51:58,295
Get me a glass of plum brandy.

1472
05:51:59,588 --> 05:52:01,087
Sanyi.

1473
05:52:09,463 --> 05:52:11,212
The gun dealer.

1474
05:52:12,129 --> 05:52:13,880
Sports guns.

1475
05:52:15,546 --> 05:52:18,838
I don't love this
job, you know that.

1476
05:52:18,963 --> 05:52:21,131
You'd better call me Páyer.

1477
05:52:22,256 --> 05:52:24,214
Mr Páyer.

1478
05:52:24,339 --> 05:52:27,589
I asked you to come here this late

1479
05:52:27,713 --> 05:52:29,880
because soon

1480
05:52:30,006 --> 05:52:33,256
I will need rather
a lot of explosive.

1481
05:53:12,382 --> 05:53:14,633
I'm going to think about it.

1482
05:53:17,716 --> 05:53:20,467
And decide as I see best.

1483
05:53:22,675 --> 05:53:26,675
And I hope you will do
your best for the success.

1484
05:53:35,884 --> 05:53:39,384
Listen, it's not entirely up to me.

1485
05:53:43,050 --> 05:53:45,551
But I need to know

1486
05:53:45,675 --> 05:53:50,510
whether you can give more
emphasis to this excellent plan

1487
05:53:50,635 --> 05:53:55,593
right now, with a
so-called good start?

1488
05:53:55,718 --> 05:53:57,718
Certainly.

1489
05:54:04,136 --> 05:54:06,551
You are a gentleman...

1490
05:54:08,177 --> 05:54:10,011
...Mr Irimiás.

1491
05:54:18,219 --> 05:54:20,469
Let me ask you something.

1492
05:54:26,511 --> 05:54:29,469
This "something new,"

1493
05:54:29,595 --> 05:54:34,428
which is waiting for us after
realizing your excellent plan...

1494
05:54:36,470 --> 05:54:40,638
- Well...
- Don't take me for a liberator.

1495
05:54:43,513 --> 05:54:45,554
Regard me as a sad researcher,

1496
05:54:45,679 --> 05:54:49,929
who investigates why everything
is as terrible as it is.

1497
05:54:52,346 --> 05:54:54,846
Would you like to
have dinner with us?

1498
05:55:00,971 --> 05:55:02,804
No, thank you.

1499
05:55:06,555 --> 05:55:12,555
Well then, we'll discuss
the details another time?

1500
05:55:12,680 --> 05:55:15,264
I'll see you on the weekend.

1501
05:55:28,722 --> 05:55:30,973
Well, gentlemen...

1502
05:55:38,931 --> 05:55:40,932
Sleep well.

1503
05:55:46,515 --> 05:55:53,266
Look, it was 25 years ago, when I was
last able to sleep five and a half hours.

1504
05:55:54,599 --> 05:55:58,016
Since then, I've been turning
in my bed, half-asleep.

1505
05:55:58,141 --> 05:56:00,558
Thank you all the same.

1506
05:58:34,564 --> 05:58:36,732
Our Father,

1507
05:58:36,857 --> 05:58:39,357
who art in heaven...

1508
05:58:41,440 --> 05:58:44,440
...Hallowed be thy name.

1509
05:58:46,024 --> 05:58:50,025
Thy kingdom come,

1510
05:58:50,149 --> 05:58:52,566
Thy will be done...

1511
05:58:55,858 --> 05:58:59,316
...on earth...

1512
05:59:01,775 --> 05:59:04,858
...as it is in heaven.

1513
05:59:06,983 --> 05:59:10,734
Give us this day our daily bread...

1514
05:59:13,983 --> 05:59:15,984
...the power...

1515
05:59:22,692 --> 05:59:24,526
Amen.

1516
05:59:59,444 --> 06:00:09,153
The Perspective, as
seen from the back

1517
06:02:14,535 --> 06:02:17,785
I don't understand Irimiás.

1518
06:02:17,909 --> 06:02:22,493
He was one of us. And
now, he's like a lord.

1519
06:02:22,618 --> 06:02:25,952
You just can't understand

1520
06:02:26,077 --> 06:02:28,410
what he wants.

1521
06:02:28,535 --> 06:02:31,036
All the nonsense he said.

1522
06:02:31,161 --> 06:02:35,660
Bent knees and cries for help!

1523
06:02:35,786 --> 06:02:39,536
Then threatening with the child...

1524
06:02:39,661 --> 06:02:43,661
The way he spoke yesterday,
I was beginning to believe it.

1525
06:02:44,870 --> 06:02:47,703
Why the hell did he
stir this shit up?

1526
06:02:47,828 --> 06:02:51,536
If I'd known he wanted
more of the same,

1527
06:02:51,662 --> 06:02:54,828
I'd have saved him the trouble.

1528
06:02:55,662 --> 06:02:58,412
It's crazy to say

1529
06:02:58,537 --> 06:03:00,912
that it was my fault.

1530
06:03:01,037 --> 06:03:06,704
That I had anything to
do with that little idiot.

1531
06:03:06,828 --> 06:03:10,328
Even her name drove me up the wall.

1532
06:03:10,454 --> 06:03:12,704
"Estike," what's that?

1533
06:03:12,829 --> 06:03:14,371
Is that a name?

1534
06:03:14,496 --> 06:03:17,704
She ate a lot of rat
poison and that's it.

1535
06:03:18,788 --> 06:03:21,788
Perhaps it was better
for the poor thing.

1536
06:03:21,913 --> 06:03:25,038
But what's the whole
thing to do with me?

1537
06:03:25,163 --> 06:03:28,247
He lured us here,
to this rundown dump.

1538
06:03:28,372 --> 06:03:31,622
And we acted like sheep.
Meanwhile he dropped out.

1539
06:03:31,746 --> 06:03:35,830
God knows where he's
drinking with our money.

1540
06:03:35,954 --> 06:03:40,122
A whole year's pay.

1541
06:03:41,747 --> 06:03:44,998
And I'm flat broke again.

1542
06:03:45,123 --> 06:03:49,872
And if he appears in a minute,
what are you going to shout at him?

1543
06:03:51,664 --> 06:03:56,747
You're the one to say that? You
have the nerve to utter a word?

1544
06:03:56,873 --> 06:03:58,040
Stop for a minute!

1545
06:03:58,165 --> 06:04:00,331
Whose fault is it
that I was robbed?

1546
06:04:00,456 --> 06:04:04,415
Who said that it'd be all
right, to share the money?

1547
06:04:04,540 --> 06:04:07,540
Irimiés and Petrina, what?

1548
06:04:10,874 --> 06:04:11,957
You fucker...

1549
06:04:12,082 --> 06:04:16,498
Give me my money back, you bastard!

1550
06:04:16,624 --> 06:04:21,707
Give me my money back.
Give it back, you prick!

1551
06:04:25,291 --> 06:04:31,124
Let's give him two minutes,
and see if he calms down.

1552
06:05:16,877 --> 06:05:21,669
- Are the two minutes up now?
- Listen, people.

1553
06:05:21,794 --> 06:05:24,836
What on earth are you
doing? Not this way!

1554
06:05:24,960 --> 06:05:27,710
- Use your heads.
- Shut up!

1555
06:05:28,710 --> 06:05:33,128
Here he is. Your saviour's here.

1556
06:05:33,253 --> 06:05:36,419
Do you really think it's my fault?

1557
06:05:36,961 --> 06:05:39,961
Give me my money back.
You hear me? Give it back!

1558
06:05:40,086 --> 06:05:44,920
I don't believe my eyes.
What are you doing there?

1559
06:05:45,961 --> 06:05:48,629
You get lost.

1560
06:05:48,754 --> 06:05:52,921
Don't worry about it.
It's none of your business.

1561
06:05:54,170 --> 06:05:57,671
Get away from here!
I won't say it twice.

1562
06:05:57,796 --> 06:05:59,796
What's going on here?

1563
06:06:12,921 --> 06:06:16,172
I want to know what's going on!

1564
06:06:18,505 --> 06:06:20,838
We thought you wouldn't come.

1565
06:06:20,963 --> 06:06:23,963
You said you'd be here
by six in the morning.

1566
06:06:25,505 --> 06:06:28,422
I do my best to help you.

1567
06:06:28,547 --> 06:06:31,256
I've had no sleep for three days,

1568
06:06:31,381 --> 06:06:34,381
I walked hours in the pouring rain,

1569
06:06:34,506 --> 06:06:38,838
I run here and there to
overcome difficulties,

1570
06:06:38,964 --> 06:06:42,964
and you behave like piglets
when their dinner is late...

1571
06:06:47,965 --> 06:06:49,965
What happened to you?

1572
06:06:55,257 --> 06:06:58,757
- My nose is bleeding.
- I can see that. But why?

1573
06:07:06,090 --> 06:07:09,758
I never expected that from you.

1574
06:07:11,465 --> 06:07:13,550
From you neither.

1575
06:07:15,800 --> 06:07:18,133
And we've just begun.

1576
06:07:19,591 --> 06:07:21,675
What will be later on?

1577
06:07:22,550 --> 06:07:24,966
Will you knife each other?

1578
06:07:26,509 --> 06:07:28,008
Sad.

1579
06:07:29,467 --> 06:07:31,301
This is very sad.

1580
06:07:34,259 --> 06:07:37,301
I'm going to forget it this time.

1581
06:07:37,426 --> 06:07:42,509
But with a condition that such a
thing can't happen again. Is it clear?

1582
06:07:45,842 --> 06:07:48,926
So let's talk sense.

1583
06:07:49,052 --> 06:07:52,052
There is something
important I have to tell you.

1584
06:07:57,302 --> 06:08:02,635
We must postpone our plans for
the manor for the time being.

1585
06:08:02,760 --> 06:08:06,302
Because in certain circles
it wouldn't be desirable

1586
06:08:06,427 --> 06:08:11,677
if an establishment for such
vague purposes were created.

1587
06:08:14,053 --> 06:08:18,969
Their primary objection is

1588
06:08:19,094 --> 06:08:21,094
the fact that the manor,

1589
06:08:21,219 --> 06:08:28,261
being almost totally isolated
and a long way from town,

1590
06:08:28,386 --> 06:08:31,929
could hardly be brought
under their control.

1591
06:08:32,053 --> 06:08:34,386
Therefore,

1592
06:08:34,512 --> 06:08:38,762
in the present situation

1593
06:08:38,887 --> 06:08:41,845
for us the only way to succeed is

1594
06:08:41,970 --> 06:08:46,012
to scatter around the
county for a time being

1595
06:08:46,137 --> 06:08:53,970
until these gentlemen
get so confused

1596
06:08:54,095 --> 06:08:59,763
that we can safely come back
here and start working as planned.

1597
06:09:01,680 --> 06:09:05,763
From now on, you
are special people.

1598
06:09:05,888 --> 06:09:08,680
For you are selected
to help in a matter

1599
06:09:08,805 --> 06:09:14,056
in which loyalty,
devotion and prudence

1600
06:09:14,181 --> 06:09:17,181
are absolutely necessary.

1601
06:09:18,930 --> 06:09:22,514
Our goals go way beyond themselves.

1602
06:09:22,639 --> 06:09:25,639
Scattering is just
a tactical decoy.

1603
06:09:25,764 --> 06:09:28,681
Because you're going to keep
in continuous contact with me,

1604
06:09:28,806 --> 06:09:33,140
even if not with each other.

1605
06:09:33,265 --> 06:09:35,098
In the meantime, do not believe

1606
06:09:35,223 --> 06:09:38,140
that we are going to remain
passively in the background

1607
06:09:38,265 --> 06:09:41,265
and wait for things to
get better by themselves.

1608
06:09:43,015 --> 06:09:47,848
What you have to do is to
listen to people around you.

1609
06:09:49,641 --> 06:09:59,641
Views, stories, events which are
imperative and connected to the matter.

1610
06:10:06,641 --> 06:10:10,308
Every one of you will need to
acquire the exceptional ability

1611
06:10:10,434 --> 06:10:15,434
by which you can distinguish
between the good and the bad signs.

1612
06:10:15,559 --> 06:10:18,183
In other words,
between right and wrong.

1613
06:10:18,309 --> 06:10:21,392
And how are we going
to live in the meantime?

1614
06:10:23,475 --> 06:10:24,975
Don't worry.

1615
06:10:26,059 --> 06:10:27,142
Don't worry.

1616
06:10:27,268 --> 06:10:31,934
Everything is organized,
everything is prepared.

1617
06:10:33,143 --> 06:10:36,017
You will all have work to do.

1618
06:10:36,143 --> 06:10:40,810
At the beginning you'll get
enough money for the basics

1619
06:10:40,934 --> 06:10:43,726
from our common capital.

1620
06:10:43,851 --> 06:10:47,936
But do not waste our time
asking unnecessary questions.

1621
06:10:48,061 --> 06:10:50,061
We are late anyway.

1622
06:10:50,186 --> 06:10:52,936
We have to start
right now, my friends.

1623
06:10:54,768 --> 06:10:59,560
Go pack your things. Hurry up.

1624
06:10:59,685 --> 06:11:03,519
Take your things and go.
Take the big things first.

1625
06:11:03,644 --> 06:11:05,477
Come on, move.

1626
06:11:13,394 --> 06:11:18,228
Kráner, you too, you hear me?

1627
06:11:18,352 --> 06:11:22,187
Wait a second. Give
us our money back.

1628
06:11:24,645 --> 06:11:29,145
You hear me? Give the money back!

1629
06:11:34,729 --> 06:11:37,020
The money?

1630
06:11:37,145 --> 06:11:39,396
Is that what you want?

1631
06:11:50,813 --> 06:11:52,522
Here, here's your money.

1632
06:11:52,646 --> 06:11:56,480
Do what you want to do
with it, alone. Good luck.

1633
06:11:57,979 --> 06:12:00,814
This is one year's
of our hard work.

1634
06:12:06,981 --> 06:12:09,814
Jéska, give the money back.

1635
06:12:11,106 --> 06:12:14,190
No, just share it out.

1636
06:12:14,315 --> 06:12:17,148
Perhaps it's better this way.

1637
06:12:17,273 --> 06:12:21,273
At least it became clear right from the
start that you have no honour or perseverance.

1638
06:12:22,940 --> 06:12:26,774
Good to know from the
start whom I can count on.

1639
06:12:30,023 --> 06:12:33,024
I think Mrs Kráner, your
husband may be right.

1640
06:12:35,982 --> 06:12:40,316
I cannot realise my plans with you.

1641
06:12:45,525 --> 06:12:48,191
I need people who are at least able

1642
06:12:48,316 --> 06:12:51,483
to look after their own interests.

1643
06:12:53,941 --> 06:12:56,483
I have to go now.

1644
06:12:56,608 --> 06:12:58,442
Wait.

1645
06:13:03,108 --> 06:13:04,692
And...

1646
06:13:06,775 --> 06:13:09,276
...the farm will be working?

1647
06:13:12,025 --> 06:13:17,443
I don't know, but this no
longer should concern you.

1648
06:13:28,276 --> 06:13:30,443
Give him the money.

1649
06:13:34,360 --> 06:13:36,776
I didn't meant it.

1650
06:13:38,194 --> 06:13:40,527
Now, take the money.

1651
06:13:46,360 --> 06:13:48,861
This rain, you know,
and the long hike.

1652
06:13:48,985 --> 06:13:53,319
We were so cold last
night. We are so sorry.

1653
06:13:54,485 --> 06:13:57,153
It's not about me.

1654
06:13:57,277 --> 06:13:59,527
It's the fact that you deserted,

1655
06:13:59,653 --> 06:14:03,611
you betrayed the cause
already on the very first day.

1656
06:14:03,736 --> 06:14:08,403
The whole thing is based on
confidence and perseverance.

1657
06:14:09,571 --> 06:14:11,737
Take the money now.

1658
06:14:17,028 --> 06:14:20,529
We trust you. Take it.

1659
06:14:20,654 --> 06:14:24,654
Look, I have no time
or mood for such scenes.

1660
06:14:26,196 --> 06:14:29,112
I must admit, you disappointed me.

1661
06:14:30,696 --> 06:14:34,946
But I will look past it
this time just for once.

1662
06:14:37,697 --> 06:14:43,697
I'm going to try and forget
this whole disgraceful event.

1663
06:16:04,159 --> 06:16:05,867
Mind how you sit there,

1664
06:16:05,992 --> 06:16:10,202
it takes at least two hours even
with this outstandingly fast vehicle.

1665
06:16:10,326 --> 06:16:12,409
Button your coats.

1666
06:16:12,534 --> 06:16:15,243
Put on your hoods and hats.

1667
06:16:15,368 --> 06:16:21,452
And just turn your backs
to the bright future

1668
06:16:21,577 --> 06:16:25,327
or this bloody rain will
get all over your faces.

1669
06:22:15,886 --> 06:22:19,970
Schmidts, Halicses,
Kráners, come on!

1670
06:22:21,635 --> 06:22:25,970
Futaki, Mr Schoolmaster,
please wait a minute.

1671
06:23:48,514 --> 06:23:50,849
What's the matter,
you're not coming?

1672
06:24:35,892 --> 06:24:38,642
Is there a pub here?

1673
06:24:38,767 --> 06:24:42,767
- We could have a drink.
- No.

1674
06:24:45,935 --> 06:24:48,518
Schmidt and family,

1675
06:24:48,643 --> 06:24:51,060
you're going to Elek.

1676
06:24:53,185 --> 06:24:57,602
I've put everything down,
who to contact and where.

1677
06:25:04,518 --> 06:25:07,518
There you'll get work
and a place to live.

1678
06:25:08,894 --> 06:25:11,144
And what work is there?

1679
06:25:12,061 --> 06:25:14,144
This is a butcher's.

1680
06:25:15,687 --> 06:25:18,519
There's plenty to do.

1681
06:25:18,645 --> 06:25:21,061
You can serve the customers.

1682
06:25:23,436 --> 06:25:24,937
Now the Kráners.

1683
06:25:26,228 --> 06:25:30,062
You ask for lstván
Kalmár in Keresztur.

1684
06:25:30,187 --> 06:25:34,020
Listen carefully,
it's not written down.

1685
06:25:34,895 --> 06:25:37,979
There's a street before
the church on the right.

1686
06:25:38,854 --> 06:25:42,271
You go down that street until you
see the "Ladies' Fashion" sign.

1687
06:25:42,396 --> 06:25:44,230
That's Kalmér's house.

1688
06:25:46,438 --> 06:25:49,855
Tell him Dönci has sent you,

1689
06:25:49,980 --> 06:25:53,230
he may have forgotten my real name.

1690
06:25:54,271 --> 06:25:58,396
He has a laundry in the
back, you'll stay there.

1691
06:25:58,521 --> 06:26:00,480
Is that clear?

1692
06:26:00,605 --> 06:26:02,439
Yes, Dönci.

1693
06:26:03,439 --> 06:26:08,064
A street after the church
and there's a sign...

1694
06:26:08,189 --> 06:26:10,064
Right.

1695
06:26:10,189 --> 06:26:12,189
Halics.

1696
06:26:13,606 --> 06:26:17,272
You go to the presbytery...

1697
06:26:19,231 --> 06:26:22,314
...and ask for Gyivicsán,
the parish priest.

1698
06:26:22,439 --> 06:26:24,107
Gyivicsán.

1699
06:26:26,398 --> 06:26:28,732
There's plenty of wine there.

1700
06:26:29,482 --> 06:26:32,732
You can clean the church

1701
06:26:32,857 --> 06:26:35,607
and do the cooking
for the three of you.

1702
06:26:36,733 --> 06:26:43,232
Here's a thousand
forints per person...

1703
06:26:44,983 --> 06:26:46,983
...if anything comes up.

1704
06:27:05,484 --> 06:27:08,650
But don't waste it.

1705
06:27:15,151 --> 06:27:19,151
And don't forget what
you're supposed to do.

1706
06:27:22,485 --> 06:27:24,318
I think all is clear.

1707
06:27:24,443 --> 06:27:28,110
We'd like to thank you for all
the good that you've clone for us.

1708
06:27:30,360 --> 06:27:32,776
You don't have to say thank you.

1709
06:27:34,610 --> 06:27:38,193
Me too, I'm only a
servant of a great cause.

1710
06:27:42,526 --> 06:27:45,526
So remember what you have to do.

1711
06:27:47,735 --> 06:27:51,736
Then take good care, as
you know we care about you.

1712
06:27:54,069 --> 06:27:56,236
Take care of yourselves.

1713
06:28:20,738 --> 06:28:25,070
Listen, you sit up there...

1714
06:28:26,863 --> 06:28:29,321
...and we'll take
you to the Streber.

1715
06:28:29,446 --> 06:28:34,446
We'll pick you up in an hour
and talk about the rest. OK?

1716
06:28:34,571 --> 06:28:36,071
OK.

1717
06:28:37,988 --> 06:28:39,405
Futaki.

1718
06:28:39,529 --> 06:28:42,779
Don't worry about me.
I know where I'm going.

1719
06:28:42,904 --> 06:28:45,904
I could find a job
somewhere as a watchman.

1720
06:28:47,489 --> 06:28:50,072
You'd be better off
doing something else.

1721
06:28:59,197 --> 06:29:02,697
What? Is there no way to
come to terms with you today?

1722
06:29:07,948 --> 06:29:12,365
Come to Steigerwald's by 8 in the
evening and we'll talk it over there.

1723
06:29:21,198 --> 06:29:23,866
All right, I'll do it your way.

1724
06:29:23,991 --> 06:29:25,490
Here.

1725
06:29:27,531 --> 06:29:29,365
A thousand forints.

1726
06:29:32,824 --> 06:29:35,824
Buy yourself a dinner
somewhere at least.

1727
06:30:15,493 --> 06:30:20,160
This Futaki is the biggest
sucker I've ever met.

1728
06:30:20,284 --> 06:30:24,534
What did he think? That
this is paradise here?

1729
06:30:25,369 --> 06:30:28,369
What did the poor devil expect?

1730
06:31:43,913 --> 06:31:53,623
Nothing but worry and work

1731
06:33:36,461 --> 06:33:39,961
- Leave out the part about eternity.
- OK.

1732
06:33:42,712 --> 06:33:48,253
"Though I don't believe it's right
to write such information down

1733
06:33:48,378 --> 06:33:53,212
"but for you to see my willingness,

1734
06:33:53,336 --> 06:33:56,045
"I am following your instructions:

1735
06:33:56,170 --> 06:33:59,254
"I've taken into account that
you encouraged me to be open

1736
06:33:59,380 --> 06:34:00,629
"in all circumstances.

1737
06:34:00,754 --> 06:34:04,087
"I must say that there can be no
doubt about my people's aptitude.

1738
06:34:04,212 --> 06:34:07,170
"I hoped I could have
convinced you of this yesterday.

1739
06:34:07,296 --> 06:34:09,630
"This is important
to emphasize again

1740
06:34:09,755 --> 06:34:13,421
"because from this rough draft might
derive other implications as well.

1741
06:34:13,546 --> 06:34:17,255
"I emphasize that in order to keep my
base working, I will be the only one

1742
06:34:17,380 --> 06:34:19,546
"to keep in touch with my people.

1743
06:34:19,671 --> 06:34:23,131
"Anything else would lead
to complete failure, etc..."

1744
06:34:23,256 --> 06:34:26,588
- I think it's all right.
- Then we leave that in.

1745
06:35:41,092 --> 06:35:42,925
Mrs Schmidt...

1746
06:35:43,425 --> 06:35:44,925
Type it.

1747
06:35:47,592 --> 06:35:50,385
Instead of a stupid woman
with big tits, you write,

1748
06:35:50,510 --> 06:35:52,884
"mentally immature person,

1749
06:35:53,010 --> 06:35:56,093
"who mostly emphasises
her female character."

1750
06:35:56,218 --> 06:35:58,260
And what about the "bloody whore"?

1751
06:35:58,385 --> 06:36:02,426
Could be a "lady of easy virtue"
or a "woman of low morals"...

1752
06:36:02,551 --> 06:36:06,551
How about "a woman prostituting
herself without hesitation"?

1753
06:36:06,676 --> 06:36:08,510
OK. Type it.

1754
06:36:39,137 --> 06:36:42,137
- Finished?
- Yeah.

1755
06:36:42,262 --> 06:36:44,679
"She went to bed with
anyone and everyone.

1756
06:36:44,803 --> 06:36:47,053
"And if she missed anyone,
that was only by accident."

1757
06:36:47,178 --> 06:36:50,178
"She's a paragon of
conjugal infidelity."

1758
06:37:06,180 --> 06:37:07,596
Finished?

1759
06:37:12,430 --> 06:37:15,971
Instead of "a stench created
by the mixing of cheap cologne

1760
06:37:16,097 --> 06:37:18,930
"with God knows what else..."

1761
06:37:20,514 --> 06:37:24,430
"She attempts to relieve
her unpleasant body odour

1762
06:37:24,555 --> 06:37:26,555
"in an unusual way."

1763
06:37:48,891 --> 06:37:50,641
- Kráner.
- What?

1764
06:37:50,766 --> 06:37:52,766
Mrs Kráner. Just type it.

1765
06:37:56,932 --> 06:37:59,891
"A termagant with a big
mouth," should be replaced with,

1766
06:38:00,016 --> 06:38:02,932
"indiscreet transmitter
of fabricated stories."

1767
06:38:03,057 --> 06:38:05,891
- And instead of "a fat sow"?
- Leave that in.

1768
06:38:06,016 --> 06:38:09,600
- We shouldn't.
- Then put "big".

1769
06:38:09,725 --> 06:38:11,975
- "Overweight".
- OK.

1770
06:38:18,475 --> 06:38:21,309
- Can we leave Mrs Halics as it is?
- Sure.

1771
06:38:38,101 --> 06:38:40,768
And what about "wrinkled
worm, filled with alcohol"?

1772
06:38:40,893 --> 06:38:43,893
"Elderly alcoholic,
short of stature"?

1773
06:38:44,977 --> 06:38:46,601
"Eager beaver."

1774
06:38:46,726 --> 06:38:49,310
"Inert dullness, blind wandering."

1775
06:38:49,434 --> 06:38:53,852
- We can leave that out.
- OK, we left it out.

1776
06:41:22,859 --> 06:41:25,692
You finished? Let's go on then.

1777
06:41:38,735 --> 06:41:40,318
Schmidt.

1778
06:41:45,986 --> 06:41:50,402
What's this? "Crude dullness mixed

1779
06:41:50,527 --> 06:41:56,694
"with featurelessness in the
abyss of uncontrollable darkness."

1780
06:41:56,819 --> 06:41:59,611
"Extreme stupidity,
inarticulate complaints,

1781
06:41:59,736 --> 06:42:02,736
"inert anxiety stiffened...

1782
06:42:04,194 --> 06:42:06,361
"...in the solid
darkness of being."

1783
06:42:06,486 --> 06:42:08,486
Write this.

1784
06:42:08,612 --> 06:42:11,361
"His modest mental ability...

1785
06:42:18,029 --> 06:42:20,862
"...his submissive
attitude to authority...

1786
06:42:30,655 --> 06:42:33,405
"...make him especially suited...

1787
06:42:38,571 --> 06:42:41,738
"...to accomplish the
activity in question...

1788
06:42:46,655 --> 06:42:49,655
"...to a high degree."

1789
06:42:54,614 --> 06:42:56,447
The schoolmaster.

1790
06:43:02,489 --> 06:43:05,239
He must have been
out of his mind here.

1791
06:43:05,364 --> 06:43:06,948
Listen to this.

1792
06:43:07,697 --> 06:43:11,240
"If someone who's about to commit
suicide by jumping in the water

1793
06:43:11,364 --> 06:43:15,323
"were to hesitate at the last moment
on the bridge whether to jump or not,

1794
06:43:15,447 --> 06:43:17,572
"he should remember
the schoolmaster

1795
06:43:17,698 --> 06:43:21,448
"and he will realise
there's only one chance.

1796
06:43:21,573 --> 06:43:23,990
- "To jump."
- Go on.

1797
06:43:25,198 --> 06:43:28,532
"He's like a withered
cucumber. In mental ability

1798
06:43:28,658 --> 06:43:32,658
"he remains below Schmidt,
a definite achievement."

1799
06:43:34,491 --> 06:43:36,908
Let's put, "Appearance:
worn down. No abilities."

1800
06:43:37,033 --> 06:43:40,449
- How did the two come together?
- That's what he wrote.

1801
06:43:52,784 --> 06:43:57,700
"He compensates for his cowardice
with narcissism and conceit.

1802
06:43:57,825 --> 06:44:00,367
"He's rather sentimental,

1803
06:44:00,492 --> 06:44:03,742
"as is often the case
with onanistic men."

1804
06:44:07,409 --> 06:44:09,243
Then "weak and sentimental.

1805
06:44:09,368 --> 06:44:13,535
- "Sexually immature."
- OK, write that.

1806
06:44:31,618 --> 06:44:33,161
As for Kráner,

1807
06:44:33,286 --> 06:44:36,952
he's a "boorish sloppy buffalo..."

1808
06:44:37,576 --> 06:44:39,994
"Though strongly built",
he worked as a smith.

1809
06:44:40,119 --> 06:44:42,369
"A strongly-built smith"?

1810
06:44:42,494 --> 06:44:46,994
"A stupid arse with
dull eyes." Go on.

1811
06:45:09,454 --> 06:45:12,120
"The only dangerous one
is Futaki, but not very.

1812
06:45:12,245 --> 06:45:15,579
"A rebel, but a cowardly one.

1813
06:45:15,704 --> 06:45:17,371
"He might have had a nice career,

1814
06:45:17,496 --> 06:45:22,329
"but he can't get rid
himself of his obsessions.

1815
06:45:22,454 --> 06:45:25,371
"I'm sure he's the one
I can surely count on."

1816
06:45:25,496 --> 06:45:27,663
- So?
- Leave it.

1817
06:45:27,788 --> 06:45:29,455
No.

1818
06:45:29,579 --> 06:45:34,996
Write "dangerous, but
can be of use," instead.

1819
06:45:39,997 --> 06:45:43,414
"Cleverer than the
others. Crippled."

1820
06:45:53,373 --> 06:45:54,705
- Is that all?
- Yeah.

1821
06:45:54,831 --> 06:45:58,081
Then sign his name. "Irimiás."

1822
06:47:57,629 --> 06:48:00,295
- Is it still raining?
- Yes.

1823
06:48:29,630 --> 06:48:31,880
<i>They shook hands outside the gate.</i>

1824
06:48:32,006 --> 06:48:34,880
<i>"You go by...?" "Bus."</i>

1825
06:48:35,006 --> 06:48:38,589
<i>"OK. II "Bye then," said the clerk.</i>

1826
06:48:38,713 --> 06:48:42,131
<i>"Nice day we had,
eh?" the other added.</i>

1827
06:48:42,256 --> 06:48:45,506
<i>Yeah, bloody good. </i>

1828
06:48:45,631 --> 06:48:49,131
<i>They shook hands again and parted.</i>

1829
06:48:50,339 --> 06:48:56,007
<i>At home, both were asked the
same question at the door,</i>

1830
06:48:56,132 --> 06:48:58,548
<i>"Did you have a bad day, dear?"</i>

1831
06:48:58,674 --> 06:49:02,757
<i>To which, shuddering and exhausted,</i>

1832
06:49:02,882 --> 06:49:07,882
<i>they could only say, "Nothing
much. The usual, my dear."</i>

1833
06:49:15,758 --> 06:49:25,258
The circle closes

1834
06:54:49,691 --> 06:54:54,024
During the thirteen days...

1835
06:54:55,400 --> 06:54:58,149
...I spent in hospital...

1836
06:55:01,650 --> 06:55:04,067
Mrs Kráner...

1837
06:55:05,317 --> 06:55:08,983
...didn't turn up...

1838
06:55:12,359 --> 06:55:14,942
...again...

1839
06:55:16,983 --> 06:55:19,234
Everything is...

1840
06:55:22,900 --> 06:55:26,068
...like I left it.

1841
06:55:36,235 --> 06:55:40,568
Neither of them dares...

1842
06:55:41,693 --> 06:55:48,694
...to come out the house.

1843
06:55:50,902 --> 06:55:56,402
They must be...

1844
06:55:57,903 --> 06:56:02,485
...lying on their beds, snoring

1845
06:56:02,611 --> 06:56:09,028
or staring at the ceiling.

1846
06:56:09,778 --> 06:56:12,195
They haven't a clue...

1847
06:56:15,654 --> 06:56:21,987
...that it is this dull...

1848
06:56:23,487 --> 06:56:29,487
...inertia...

1849
06:56:30,362 --> 06:56:33,779
...that leaves them...

1850
06:56:35,029 --> 06:56:37,821
...at the mercy

1851
06:56:37,946 --> 06:56:43,280
of what they most fear.

1852
06:58:02,991 --> 06:58:09,659
A cosmic economy.

1853
06:58:13,951 --> 06:58:18,118
My hearing...

1854
06:58:19,534 --> 06:58:24,535
...is getting worse.

1855
07:03:17,841 --> 07:03:25,007
The Turks are coming!
The Turks are coming!

1856
07:03:25,132 --> 07:03:32,300
The Turks are coming!
The Turks are coming!

1857
07:06:53,435 --> 07:06:55,685
I must be crazy.

1858
07:06:55,811 --> 07:06:59,853
I've mistaken the bells of the sky

1859
07:06:59,978 --> 07:07:03,560
for the sound of the
bell for the dead.

1860
07:11:15,865 --> 07:11:21,448
One morning...

1861
07:11:22,365 --> 07:11:26,699
...at the end of October

1862
07:11:26,824 --> 07:11:31,824
not long before...

1863
07:11:32,532 --> 07:11:37,116
...the first drops...

1864
07:11:38,616 --> 07:11:44,450
...of the insufferably long

1865
07:11:44,575 --> 07:11:51,157
autumn rains

1866
07:11:51,283 --> 07:11:55,117
fell on the parched

1867
07:11:55,242 --> 07:11:59,658
<i>some ground</i>

1868
07:11:59,783 --> 07:12:06,368
on the western side of the yard...

1869
07:12:07,783 --> 07:12:10,618
...when...

1870
07:12:11,534 --> 07:12:17,284
...the mud of the stinking bog

1871
07:12:17,409 --> 07:12:20,243
makes the roads

1872
07:12:20,368 --> 07:12:24,910
impassable,

1873
07:12:25,035 --> 07:12:34,452
cutting off the town...

1874
07:12:37,160 --> 07:12:49,578
...until the first frosts.

1875
07:12:53,369 --> 07:12:59,036
Futaki was awakened...

1876
07:12:59,161 --> 07:13:05,579
by the sound of bells.

1877
07:13:05,704 --> 07:13:10,036
There was a solitary chapel

1878
07:13:10,161 --> 07:13:19,162
eight kilometres to the south-west

1879
07:13:19,288 --> 07:13:25,704
at the old Hochmeiss field

1880
07:13:25,829 --> 07:13:39,580
but it had no bell

1881
07:13:39,705 --> 07:13:49,873
its tower having collapsed

1882
07:13:49,998 --> 07:13:56,831
during the war...
