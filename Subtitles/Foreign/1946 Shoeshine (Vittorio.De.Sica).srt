1
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:43,317
SHOESHINE

2
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:31,075
- Bersagliere is the best!
- Of course, he's a great horse

3
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,397
As soon as I said, "Go, Bersagliere!"
he went like a rocket!

4
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:37,160
Even in America
you won't find horses like this

5
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,554
Nonsense. In America...

6
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,830
They probably feed horses a lot
over there

7
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,191
Boy! I've told you enough times
not to leave the horse unattended

8
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,914
But that's not a horse -
it's a small table!

9
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,714
He's always joking around.
What about the proposal?

10
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,035
Fifty or nothing

11
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,879
- But it's only 50 of 1,OOO-lira notes
- It's only paper

12
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,229
Yeah, whatever

13
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,351
We're shoeshine boys...

14
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,233
...so everyone thinks
we make a lot of money

15
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,351
Pay him and let's go

16
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,197
- Is it expensive to keep a horse?
- At least 300 lira a day

17
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,914
Bersagliere,
you're an expensive horse!

18
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:13,431
Fifty is fine, but we're a bit short now.
Can we pay you in a week?

19
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,279
- All right
- Promise?

20
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,799
- Promise?
- Promise

21
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,718
- Goodbye, Mr Anucci
- Goodbye

22
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:36,153
It's only fair. Until we buy him,
he can rent him out to anybody else

23
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,233
- How much have we got?
- 32 or 35... I'm not sure

24
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,237
I've told you, you must be precise

25
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,273
You're right, but this morning
I made a lot of payments

26
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,836
Five, ten...
I've arranged them in stacks of five

27
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:55,830
- Good
- 15, 20, 25, 30, 31, 32...

28
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,359
...33,5OO lira

29
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,713
- Plus 7,500 lira from the Genoa man
- And 3,700 from the caretaker

30
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,231
33,500 plus 3,700 and 7,500..

31
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,557
We're short by 5,300 lira

32
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,674
Marcello, did the stuff arrive?

33
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,918
No. He's been saying "Tomorrow,
tomorrow" for a week now...

34
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,634
...and in the meantime
he gets his shoes shined

35
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,594
- When you bring?
- Tomorrow

36
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,109
To you and your grandfather!

37
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,038
These pay!

38
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,759
Do you want these glasses?

39
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,871
No, they break and cannot be hidden

40
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,153
- And they cannot be painted
- Somebody else will buy them

41
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,959
Are you laughing to yourself?

42
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,151
- I was thinking, he eats more than us
- Who?

43
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,315
- The horse
- Yeah

44
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,034
- Shoeshine, Joe?
- Where are we going to put him?

45
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,676
I was thinking of taking him
to that guy at Porta San Sebastiano

46
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,279
He'd starve him to death

47
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,916
We're not stupid. After work,
we go and have him fed in front of us

48
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,680
But in that way
he'd only eat once a day

49
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,553
- Maybe I should sleep in the stable
- I'll come with you

50
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,320
- And your parents?
- They won't care

51
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,874
We'll see

52
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,310
For now,
let's worry about making some money

53
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,559
- Giuseppe!
. What's up?

54
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,159
Hi, Giuseppe

55
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,911
Shoeshine, Joe?

56
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,074
Then Pasquale said, "Go,
Bersagliere!", and he started off...

57
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,716
- Running in circles
- Don't be silly! I meant...

58
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,638
You're such a moron!

59
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,589
When are you going
to bring me chocolate?

60
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,119
Don't sell it, eat it!

61
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,754
I'm not an idiot! Thank you

62
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,871
Our problem is that
we're not organised

63
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,957
That's why the guards
steal our boxes

64
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,754
They've stolen two from me.
What do they do with them?

65
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,678
- They sell them again
- Pasquale!

66
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,155
- Hi, Nannarella
- Where's Giuseppe?

67
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,954
- Giuseppe!
- Hi

68
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:11,280
- Your Mum needs 300 lira
- I've given her 500 this morning!

69
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,232
- She needs it
- Can I give it to her?

70
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,589
Sure

71
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,313
Money has no value nowadays

72
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,909
Last year I'd give her 200 lira
and it was enough

73
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,998
Lucky you're alone,
you've only yourself to think of

74
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,919
What are you talking about?
If I still had my parents...

75
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,838
...I'd give them one million a day!

76
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,190
What do you mean?
You're not happy at ours?

77
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:32,517
- No, not at all
- Let's go now

78
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,516
Are you still sleeping in the lift?

79
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:42,874
No, the damned landlord found out,
so I can't go there anymore

80
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,719
Now I sleep with Giuseppe,
at Dante Alighieri school

81
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,593
It's such a mess in there!

82
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,074
Shoeshine, Joe?

83
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,472
The other day at the hotel
he gave me a chocolate pudding...

84
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,193
...with ice cream inside

85
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,357
If I'd known,
I'd have come with you

86
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,471
I know, but women are not allowed

87
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,432
- Giuseppe!
- Hi

88
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,437
Where's Pasquale?

89
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,358
He's working at Fori Imperiali

90
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,991
- Who's that?
- My big brother, Attilio

91
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,714
- He must be rich
- He can't complain

92
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,433
Can you take me home?

93
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,871
I can't leave Pasquale alone,
otherwise he doesn't do any work

94
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,755
- See you this evening, then. Bye
- Bye

95
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,998
OK, 1:00 at the San Paolo gas tank

96
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,430
Is it something important?
I don't waste time

97
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,755
It's something big

98
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,109
- OK, bye
- Bye

99
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,436
Excuse me

100
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,155
Where have you been?

101
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,636
With Nannarella. Iwalked her
across the street, with all these cars

102
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,558
Damn!

103
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,716
Careful,
or you'll stain his trousers!

104
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,719
What did my brother tell you?

105
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,196
He said that Panza
will meet me today at 1:00

106
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,790
Here's Pasquale

107
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,553
It's 1:30, you know

108
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,390
We were eating

109
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,992
- Who's this?
- My partner

110
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,795
- You even got a partner!
- He's my brother

111
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,115
Let's go

112
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,629
I have business for you -
two American blankets

113
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,912
Go to 48 Via del Babuino.
On the fourth floor there's a lady

114
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,838
Go there at 3:00 and you'll find her

115
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,076
- And?
- She'll buy the blankets

116
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,271
- At what price?
- Why do you want to know?

117
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,471
- I'm the partner
- True!

118
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,750
- Try to get the most
- Prices have gone down

119
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,394
- 2,400 or 2,500 lira at the most
- But 10% is for you

120
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,716
10%...

121
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,958
- 300 lira
- Let's do 20%

122
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:05,039
Let's say 500 and it's a deal.
Give them the blankets!

123
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,991
Let's go

124
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,832
Come on! Come on!

125
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,394
Go to the lady at 3:00 sharp, OK?

126
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,511
Don't worry, we will

127
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,675
Whoever invented the lift is a genius

128
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,679
Tell me about it.
I've slept in one for three months

129
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,030
Accountant Piatti Giulio

130
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,438
Here we are. "Margherita Donati
Anselmi, qualified fortune-teller"

131
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,073
Goodbye, madam and thank you

132
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,476
Thank you, miss

133
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,511
- Madam?
- What do you want?

134
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,076
- We have two American blankets
- I'm not interested

135
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,915
- How much?
- 3,500

136
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,077
You must be joking!

137
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,111
- 3,000
- Let's have a look

138
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,958
Follow me

139
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,716
- They've never been used
- So I see

140
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,434
- You can make a coat
- To get stopped by some American

141
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,312
Nobody would stop you!

142
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,993
You're such a fine woman,
it would suit you perfectly

143
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,110
- How much?
- 3,000

144
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,992
- And 500
- Shut up, you! 2,500

145
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,111
We haven't stolen them!

146
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,277
I won't give you more than 2,500

147
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,676
Let's do 2,800 and that's it

148
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,791
OK, I'll take them

149
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,278
Why did you accept?

150
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,710
We won't get
more than 500 lira anyway

151
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,311
- 2,000, 2,500..
- What game is this?

152
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:51,000
Leave those cards!
Where are your manners?

153
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,509
Look what you've done, blast you!

154
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,675
There's the postman,
the train, the funeral...

155
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,030
- What are they for?
- To read the future

156
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,834
Could you tell us
what's going to happen tomorrow?

157
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,633
We'll give you a bottle of milk

158
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,479
- It will be fresh too
- You're only kids

159
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,353
- Why? Kids don't have a future?
- Of course, they have

160
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:13,075
Then tell us, please

161
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,559
25 cards to ask, 25 devils...
What's your name?

162
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,954
- Giuseppe!
- Pasquale!

163
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,878
Cut

164
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:24,152
In the home, outside,
what awaits you and what doesn't...

165
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:27,113
...who loves you and who doesn't.
Pick a card

166
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,993
At home there's an old lady
who thinks about you

167
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,519
My mother is not that old

168
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,950
Stop it, or I won't read you the cards

169
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:38,074
The old lady is sad about a letter,
but everything will be sorted out

170
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,714
Outside there is a gentleman
protecting you

171
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:44,390
- Anucci
- But he just guards horses

172
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:48,070
Somebody's at the door.
It's a customer. Wait a moment

173
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,631
Are you
Mrs Margherita Donati Anselmi?

174
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,797
- Yes, why?
- Police

175
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,718
We have a search warrant

176
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,719
I don't understand. I am licensed

177
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:06,470
The police chief knows me. His wife
is actually one of my customers

178
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,116
I'm sorry, madam,
but we have to follow our orders

179
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,029
We've been informed
that you buy stolen goods

180
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,151
Me? That's not true, I swear

181
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:19,716
There they are, those two.
Take them away

182
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:26,912
We have to come inside, madam.
After you, madam

183
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,276
- What's going on?
- None of your business

184
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,994
Did you sell the blankets?
Keep the money and go

185
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,350
- What do you mean?
- Don't be silly, just go

186
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,232
Here is another 3,000 lira. Now go

187
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,034
You've seen nothing
and you know nothing

188
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,869
- What are we going to do now?
- I don't know

189
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,677
So, 3,000 plus 2,800
from the blankets...

190
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,598
It's 5,800

191
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,479
- Did you hear Attilio?
- We've seen nothing

192
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,319
- And we know nothing
- We were sleepwalking!

193
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,312
Let's go and buy the horse!

194
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,194
Wake up!

195
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:01,398
- Good morning, Bersagliere!
- Good morning, Bersagliere!

196
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:04,717
What a great horse!
There's none like him!

197
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:08,356
- He's almost eaten everything
- Look at his belly, it's like a drum!

198
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,871
He could have eaten even more.
He stuffed himself!

199
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,755
Hey, boys! What have you decided?

200
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:19,077
The horse stays here.
We'll pay you stabling fees...

201
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,237
...and we'll come here
to look after him

202
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,318
- Will you groom him and wash him?
- Wash him?

203
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:27,193
What? Don't you wash your face
every morning?

204
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,596
We'll wash him straight away.
Untie him!

205
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,631
Can you help me?

206
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:37,033
- There's no stirrup!
- Come on, get on him!

207
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,276
- Come on!
- Let's go!

208
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:44,309
- Control him well, OK?
- Don't be afraid. Hold on tight

209
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,479
No, no! There they are!
There they are!

210
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,673
- These are the two boys
- Search them

211
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,313
You can go now

212
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,471
- Here I am
- Just one moment

213
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,235
Yes?

214
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:43,671
We've arrested the two boys
involved in Via del Babuino burglary

215
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,269
- What burglary?
- At the fortune-tellefis home

216
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:50,075
Ah, yes. Let them in.
Call Losito too

217
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,840
Let it boil a minute over
than a minute less

218
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:56,919
There have been bad accidents
for not boiling long enough

219
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,680
There they are, Chief. It's them

220
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:03,759
Make them confess. They know
everything, these criminals!

221
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,917
Calm down, madam.
Don't get so upset

222
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,759
I've been robbed of 700,000 lira!

223
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,156
700,000 lira!
I wish I had that much!

224
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:15,877
So, why did you go
to the lady's house yesterday?

225
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,675
- To buy some empty bottles
- Liar! You wanted to sell me blankets

226
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,632
And you bought them!

227
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,639
Note it in the records -
she bought two American blankets

228
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:27,400
It's outrageous!
I'll end up going to prison myself

229
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:32,833
Mrs Donati Anselmi
bought two American blankets

230
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,753
Where did you steal them?
Look at me, boys!

231
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,994
Excuse me

232
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,236
Where did you steal those blankets?

233
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,751
An American friend of ours
gave them to us

234
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,349
What's his name?

235
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,153
- Joe
- Joe

236
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:53,398
Ah, Joe

237
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:57,354
- What's the name of the fat one?
- Which fat one?

238
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,074
The one who went
to the fortune-teller yesterday

239
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,350
- I don't know him
- Don't play games with me

240
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,676
I'll jail you
and feed you bread and water

241
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,199
- Pasquale!
- He's joking

242
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:09,153
- You think so?
- With only bread and water, we'd die

243
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,715
- Tell me the truth!
- We have!

244
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:14,639
Losito, lock them up, then we'll see!

245
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,159
Go! Go!

246
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,475
I'll have to press charges
against you too, madam

247
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,116
I'm a honest woman, ask your wife
who's one of my good customers

248
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:27,359
Of course! I'm not surprised.
My wife has a pea brain!

249
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:33,158
- Go away, please, madam
- But, Chief...

250
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,351
I work
and she goes to the fortune-teller

251
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,994
She wants to know
when I'm going to kick the bucket

252
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,554
Chief? Excuse me

253
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:42,593
What are we going to do
with those two boys?

254
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,633
Take them to the juvenile prison

255
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,558
Tomorrow morning

256
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,629
Is this the house of the refugees?

257
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,558
Excuse me, the Filippucci family?

258
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,069
Second floor, 3 C

259
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,475
Excuse me,
are you the Filippucci family?

260
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,797
Amalia! You're wanted

261
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,916
- I'd like to speak to your husband
- Why?

262
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,838
It's business

263
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:49,475
- Vittorio! Hey!
- Damn it

264
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,750
- What now?
- This lady wants to speak to you

265
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,030
- Attilio is hereto see you
- Why?

266
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:00,198
He wants to speak to you

267
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,798
- Dad, they've arrested...
- Who?

268
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:10,232
Giuseppe. Don't go and get involved
otherwise I'll land in trouble

269
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:13,159
Don't worry, I won't go

270
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,551
Nannarella!

271
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,993
First, drop the others off
at Regina Coeli, then the kids

272
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,831
Get out

273
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:36,357
Come on, come with me

274
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,117
- Hi
- Hi

275
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,479
Thank you

276
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:06,200
Let's go. No, this way

277
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,671
- Hi
- Hi

278
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,478
Can I come in?

279
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:40,680
Your family has been informed.
Here...

280
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,155
Librasi, Angelo. Resident of Bari

281
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,237
But it's been three months since...

282
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:49,877
What can I do? They'll write. If they
come, I'll let you know. Go, now

283
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,396
Good morning.
I brought you some others

284
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:57,751
How kind of you

285
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:01,555
At this rate, they'll have to sleep
in the courtyard

286
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,513
"illegal sale of stolen goods...

287
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,313
..."accessory to burglary..."

288
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,829
..."to be held pending
police investigation"

289
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,678
- Take care
- Goodbye

290
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,359
- Fede?
- Yes, sir?

291
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,471
Book these two

292
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,914
Come here, you two

293
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,955
- What's your name?
- Maggi, Pasquale

294
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,276
- Your father?
- Dead

295
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,960
- I mean, his name
- Luigi

296
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,435
- Your mother?
- Maria Fabris

297
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,790
Living?

298
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:41,472
- Born?
- In Rome, October 29th 1931

299
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,230
Living at?

300
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,352
30, Via Lombardia

301
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,118
With...?

302
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,073
- With no one
- What? With nobody?

303
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,272
Nobody. I sleep in the lift

304
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,189
Of no fixed abode

305
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:06,635
Put your hand here and push hard

306
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,159
-3x4?
-12

307
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,191

00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,912
Ignorant! 8 x 8?

310
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:29,158
- 64, ignorant! 3 x 3?
- 9

311
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,399
- It's the director!
- Attention! Turn about!

312
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,913
Good, very good

313
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,680
Morning, Staff era. I've heard.
My condolences

314
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,552
- How old was he?
- 10

315
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,715
Your only child?

316
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:57,151
No, I have four others. But he was
the youngest and the brightest

317
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,873
Be strong!

318
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,593
Attention!

319
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,751
-6x9?
- s4

320
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,200
-7x7?
-49

321
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,913
-8x5?
-40

322
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,314
-9x3?
-27

323
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,351
It's the director, go inside!

324
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,710
- Good morning, Bartoli
- Good morning, sir

325
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,832
- What are you doing here?
- We're fighting against the bugs

326
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,395
- I'm using a product I invented
- Very good

327
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,511
We should disinfest the place

328
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,438
We'll do it, Barioli

329
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:31,997
- The boys are complaining
- They always complain

330
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:35,590
- We have some new arrivals
- As always

331
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,119
Who is he?

332
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:42,110
- Get up, come on. Stand to attention
- Marcello Scalari from Velletri

333
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,470
Accused of armed robbery.
Confessed

334
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,113
On his own?

335
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,914
No, with four adults

336
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:51,634
I have a younger sister
and two younger brothers

337
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,355
My father is a prisoner in Germany.
We had nothing to eat

338
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:58,677
Armed robbery! In a few days,
he'll start complaining too

339
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,598
Who are these?

340
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,759
Come forward, boys.
Come on, come on

341
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,918
- Who are they?
- Maggi and Filippucci

342
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,031
To be held pending investigation

343
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,993
Send them to section one
after the doctor sees them

344
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,838
- Yes
- I wanted to tell you...

345
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,236
...today we had a delegation
of parents

346
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,352
A delegation? Has it come to this?
Did they want to strike?

347
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,074
No, sir, they came to push
for the investigations

348
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,191
These boys have been in jail
for months

349
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:28,312
And whose fault is that?
If you read the statistics...

350
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:31,671
...you'll see that, compared to 1936,
crime has increased by 60%

351
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:35,430
- Judges are overloaded with work
- Yes, but these are only boys

352
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:39,679
Boys? Armed robbery, burglary,
pick-pocketing, procuring...

353
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,189
Shall we deprive them of fruit
as punishment?

354
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:46,029
- If only we had fruit!
- You must realise, Bartoli...

355
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:49,676
...that we're running ajail here
not a day-care centre

356
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:53,555
And if you forget that,
you'll remain an assistant forever

357
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,671
Attention!

358
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,511
Not bad

359
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,679
Passable

360
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,275
At ease!

361
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,276
As second course,
we have loin steak

362
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,439
Not for me. I'd like something
less heavy. I have heartburn

363
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,676
- Fried sweetbread and courgettes?
- Yes

364
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,790
- Me, too!
- And me!

365
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:26,719
- Spring lamb for me!
- Hi, Tamburini. Where's Attilio?

366
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,956
He didn't want to come, he's scared

367
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,230
Move over

368
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:34,478
- So?
- They didn't talk

369
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:38,719
I always said that those two
were good guys. Boss?

370
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:43,118
Boss? I've changed my mind. Bring
the steaks, and make them thick

371
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:47,598
Tomorrow we'll send them a parcel
of goods. They deserve it

372
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,159
- What did you order?
- Sweetbread and courgettes

373
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:56,236
When the boys are inside,
they have to feel good...

374
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:59,557
...otherwise they'll keep
bad memories and will be of no use

375
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:14,513
The trams are still running.
It can't be that late

376
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,792
- Are you hungry?
- No

377
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:22,198
- Do you think my father knows?
- Sure. Nannarella must've told him

378
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,470
I guess so

379
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,672
These must be lice. They sting

380
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,110
No, they're bugs

381
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,951
If you say so

382
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:42,071
- What's going to happen to us?
- I'm sure they'll release us soon

383
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,794
They can't keep us here
if we've done nothing

384
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,479
- Yes, but Panza...
- Shut up!

385
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,874
Forget that name!
We know nothing

386
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,072
- What about the blankets?
- It's none of our business

387
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,760
- It's the fortune-tellefis problem
- Hope so

388
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,315
I'm sure about it

389
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:03,513
These lice really sting!

390
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,632
It's all my stupid brother's fault

391
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,400
I know. But we have to keep
our mouths shut

392
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:15,717
Then maybe when we get out,
we'll reckon with him

393
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:22,109
- Will they feed him?
- Of course

394
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,676
Maybe not a lot,
but it's only for a few days anyway

395
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,711
You told Nannarella we bought him?

396
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,672
How? I haven't seen her since

397
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,711
We cannot tell anybody...

398
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,878
...or somebody will take him from us

399
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,913
I can't wait to see him again

400
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,031
Me, too

401
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,713
Mr Annibale!

402
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,319
What is it?

403
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,239
That horse is sick again

404
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:05,273
He needs to rest.
Give him water and oats

405
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,791
Use water and vinegar,
then we'll have to wait and see

406
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:11,036
And today of all days,
I've got a funeral

407
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:14,755
Why don't you hitch the coach
to the boys' horse?

408
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,470
Let's go!

409
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,640
Go!

410
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,597
Let's go!

411
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,959
Breathe. Deeper. Again

412
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,600
Get dressed

413
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,871
Here's your ticket for soup

414
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,118
I want a ticket for bread instead.
The soup is rubbish

415
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,959
Come on! You boys are
always complaining

416
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:08,074
- As if you ate well at home!
- I did. My father's a fisherman

417
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:11,238
I had gilthead, sea bass, fish soup

418
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,000
- Delicious!
- Go, I'll take care of the bread

419
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:16,316
The bread is better,
the soup is rubbish

420
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,317
Rubbish, rubbish

421
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,959
Ouch!

422
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,310
Put the bandage back on

423
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,999
How's the Neapolitan?

424
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:31,238
Getting worse. You can't expect him
to get better in here

425
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:34,398
I asked long ago for him
to be transferred to the hospital

426
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:37,638
At the Forlanini, the patients
are packed in like sardines

427
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,195
- So?
- Send him home. Why's he here?

428
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:44,234
- Vagrancy
- Better a vagrant than being dead

429
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,715
- Release him
- If it were up to me...

430
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:49,878
You have to be patient. Like me

431
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,435
Doctor, new arrivals

432
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,870
What, now?

433
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,914
Undress

434
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,111
I'll see the others tomorrow

435
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,231
Maggi, Pasquale?

436
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,476
- Who's Maggi, Pasquale?
- Me

437
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:07,877
- Have you been sick?
- Measles and whooping cough

438
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:08,990
And you?

439
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,509
I've never had whooping cough
or measles...

440
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:15,190
- ...but apparently I've had tapeworm
- You'll get rid of it in here

441
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,436
- Parents' statement?
- They didn't come

442
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,550
As usual

443
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:21,194
- Have they been to section one?
- Yes, of course

444
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:40,030
Silence!

445
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,236
Silence, I said!

446
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,951
Silence, silence!

447
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,319
How many of you?

448
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,716
Four. But Gigino counts for two
as he's sick

449
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,673
There has to be five in a cell,
like everybody else

450
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:11,551
- I want to stay with him!
- Forget it! Leave him!

451
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,749
- Bastards!
- Let's go!

452
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,076
Cowards!

453
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,991
Hello, kid!

454
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:49,798
- Rat!
- Bastard! Son of a bitch!

455
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,794
Silence! Understand? Shut up!

456
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:25,718
Silence! Understand?

457
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,434
- Silence!
- What's happening?

458
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:31,712
Silence, boys! Shut up!

459
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,309
- Shut up!
- What's happening?

460
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:39,037
A guard knocked around one of
the newcomers, so they're protesting

461
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:46,830
Exercise in the courtyard
is suspended until further notice!

462
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:54,316
The director will hold you responsible
for any turmoil that ensues

463
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:59,515
Exercise in the courtyard
is suspended until further notice

464
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:02,439
Yes, until further notice!

465
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,111
Open the shutters

466
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:10,514
Open the shutters

467
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,950
When I get out of here...

468
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:18,075
...I want to smash Staff era's head,
I swear!

469
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,555
What are you talking about?

470
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:25,151
Pasquale!

471
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,989
- I'm here!
- Calm down!

472
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:31,680
- What's your name?
- Giuseppe Filippucci

473
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:34,394
- Why did they arrest you?
- I don't know nothing

474
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:37,478
You can tell us, we won't say a word

475
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:40,069
But I don't know nothing

476
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:43,033
What are you doing?
This is Arcangeli's place

477
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:45,959
If he finds you there, you're in trouble

478
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,833
- Where can I stay?
- Over there

479
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,869
Did you put your fingerprints
in the book?

480
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,638
- How many fingers?
- Four

481
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,957
What a silly little boy!

482
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,071
- Really stupid!
- Idiot!

483
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,793
- Is it bad?
- Very bad

484
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:07,871
- Four fingers mean four years in jail
- Four years! You'll rot in here!

485
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,150
Oh, my God!

486
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,678
When you want something,
you have to say the opposite

487
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:22,156
Like with your friend,
you have to say you hate him

488
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,794
- That's what you do with the masters
- Who?

489
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:27,389
- The guards, that's what we call them
- Why?

490
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,875
Who knows?
Maybe because they're "literal"

491
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:35,120
- You mean "literate", you ignoramus!
- Sorry, professor

492
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:38,517
They're masters
when it comes to stealing cigarettes

493
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,995
- Smoking's allowed?
- No, it's not

494
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,509
And because it's not allowed,
we all smoke

495
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:46,553
He's the only one who doesn't,
he has a lung disease

496
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:51,072
I'm going to go to hospital
and be cured when I get out

497
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:56,636
- Time to eat
- Time to eat, finally!

498
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:59,513
Time to eat!

499
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:02,280
Good, I'm starving.
Yesterday we only had bread...

500
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,471
...because we weren't booked yet

501
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,398
Lucky you're hungry...

502
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:10,718
...otherwise you wouldn't be able
to eat what they give us

503
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,631
- Take it downstairs
- You take it

504
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,751
- Take it downstairs
- No, you take it

505
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,269
Just take it, you idiot!

506
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:36,875
- My friend Giuseppe isn't here
- Different shift. He'll eat later

507
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,353
Pasquale!

508
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,230
Giuseppe!

509
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,634
I'm here!

510
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,794
Stay in line, or I'll tell the master

511
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:50,515
Don't react.
He's a bastard. He spies on you

512
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:56,639
Attention! Face left! Left!

513
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:00,754
Forward march.
One, two, one, two...

514
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,031
This food isn't edible

515
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:15,273
It is, it is.
It's always disgusting at first...

516
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,995
...but then you have to eat it,
if you don't want to starve to death

517
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:22,397
- Disgusting!
- Aren't you hungry, Raffaele?

518
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,511
- I'm not hungry
- Try harder

519
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:28,634
Even if you don't like it,
you have to eat. Understand?

520
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,837
Of course, I understand

521
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,196
Are you not going to eat it?

522
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,837
You've a strong stomach!

523
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,555
Are you surprised? He had
the stomach to kill his father!

524
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:57,200
Sit down, don't be stupid

525
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:14,913
- Vanzetti!
- Vanzetti, ground floor, number 7

526
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,235
Filippucci!

527
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,829
- Filippucci!
- Reach out your hand!

528
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,359

536
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,073
Filippucci

537
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,031
A huge parcel!

538
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:17,716
- Where's that moron going?
- How are you? Take some

539
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:20,514
- That's not allowed!
- Why? He's a friend

540
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:24,076
Go to your cell,
or I'll confiscate your parcel

541
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:29,839
- Damn it!
- What a prick!

542
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:32,474
One day I'll punch that son of a bitch

543
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:35,069
Calm down,
you have to suffer in silence

544
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:39,433
- I'm not going to suffer in silence
- You'll get into trouble, then

545
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:42,996
- I'm starving
- Do this, then!

546
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:47,398
- You'll soon lose your appetite!
- He's coming!

547
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,119
- Five! Six!
- Seven! Nine!

548
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:54,471
- Three! Two!
- Five! Four!

549
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:57,638
- Two! Five!
- Seven! Five!

550
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,752
- Five! Three!
- Five! Four!

551
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:04,157
- Three! Five!
- Three! Seven!

552
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,635
- Five!
- Three!

553
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:10,230
Five! Five!

554
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:13,318
Five! Five!

555
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:19,676
Help yourselves,
there's plenty in here

556
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:22,394
We'll give you a hand with it

557
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:27,798
There were 10 pears, but the guard
took four, and an egg

558
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,709
Set that aside. Don't let those
cheapskates stuff themselves

559
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,559
Disgusting!

560
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,029
No! This is for my friend!

561
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,359
- Who's he?
- A newcomer

562
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,637
That's for...

563
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,958
There's a note inside

564
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:19,550
How can it be? My mother's
very careful when she cooks

565
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:23,913
"As the heart says: keep quiet...

566
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:26,031
..."Sincerity is the enemy of love"

567
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,798
- Understand?
- No

568
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,354
You lamebrain!

569
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:33,519
- They're telling you not to talk
- Now, I understand

570
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:34,710
Finally!

571
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:38,037
There was no need for it.
I wouldn't have talked anyway

572
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:41,596
Very good, I like you!
We'll become good friends

573
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:55,589
- Amazing! Who gave them to you?
- Santa Claus

574
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,791
We don't have any

575
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,591
Master!

576
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,638
What now?

577
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:23,758
What a thief!

578
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:24,870
Only three

579
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,311
Only three? What a wretch!
You keeper of human meat...

580
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,909
...you worthless thief!

581
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:34,271
- Can I have a smoke?
- I'm first

582
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,595
I'm first!

583
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:11,634
- Giuseppe
- Pasquale

584
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,592
- I was looking for you
- Me, too

585
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:15,518
- How is it going?
- Not too bad

586
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:17,870
Yesterday I ate,
thanks to that parcel

587
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,118
- Yeah, I saw it
- I wanted to give you some but...

588
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:22,958
Never mind

589
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:26,679
- I need to talk to you
- What is it?

590
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:33,833
- That must be the boy's friend
- I don't like the look of him

591
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:37,590
There was no need for the note,
we're not spies

592
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:40,997
My brother's so afraid,
he's probably shitting his pants

593
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:43,316
He's nothing to worry about with me

594
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:44,839
He's Arcangeli

595
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,553
- Nice to meet you
- You, too

596
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:49,274
I'll lend you a towel and soap,
if you need them

597
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,914
- Thanks. He found the note
- Him?

598
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:56,318
He's a great guy.
He's in here for armed robbery

599
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:57,874
With a machine gun!

600
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,880
His gang steals cars, too.
His father's a doctor, he's a student

601
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,230
- I don't like him
- You don't know him

602
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:08,752
I like the others, too.
I'd love it if you could be with us

603
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:11,190
_Ma99i, Pasquale!
FmPPucci, Giuseppe!

604
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:14,551
- That's us!
- Go see the chief constable

605
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:16,717
Why did you sack
those two masters?

606
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:20,231
They were stealing from boys'
parcels and trading cigarettes

607
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:23,512
Nowadays, poverty
makes people lose their head

608
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:28,309
- Here are the two boys
- Come in, come in

609
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:35,792
So, you've stated that
you don't know the three men...

610
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,719
...who entered
Mrs Donati Anselmi's house?

611
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:40,239
Right

612
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:43,239
But do you know Mr Anucci?

613
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:45,514
- Yes
- Yes

614
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:49,634
Very good. Now, this man
came to see me yesterday

615
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:53,549
- He said he sold you a black horse
- No, it was white

616
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:56,911
Yes, a white one. I misread it, sorry

617
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:59,600
A white horse,
for 50,000 lira, correct?

618
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:01,791
- Yes
- Yes

619
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:05,675
You made the purchase one hour
after the burglary in Via del Babuino

620
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:08,076
I understand where you're going,
Chief

621
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:10,476
But you're wrong.
We already had the money

622
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:13,956
- And how did you earn it?
- That's our business

623
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:18,039
Listen, boys. I came here with good
intentions. I want to help you

624
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:20,879
Yesterday I spoke to your father,
he's distraught

625
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,152
You have to tell the truth,
if you want him to forgive you

626
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:26,510
We told you the truth.
We know nothing

627
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,756
You're too nice. Give them to me...

628
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:32,510
...and I'll show you how I can make
them speak by giving them the belt!

629
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:35,473
Hear that? Why would you
want to get beaten up...

630
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:37,591
...and end up in a rat-infested cell?

631
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:40,633
To defend whom? Some criminals

632
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:42,797
I'd understand if it were family...

633
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:46,595
...but you are all alone, and you are
from a poor but honest family

634
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,074
Listen, Chief...

635
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:52,194
...you can kill us, but we can't tell you
what we don't know

636
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:56,154
- Too bad!
- Bring the youngest!

637
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:01,709
Don't worry, it's your turn next

638
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:07,590
Undress him. And remove his shirt

639
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:12,231
Are you going to talk?

640
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:29,271
That's enough!

641
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:32,992
Come on, that's enough

642
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:35,634
Stop!

643
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,671
Have you made up your mind?

644
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:39,791
Give me the names

645
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:43,713
I swear, we don't know anything

646
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:48,115
Enough,enough

647
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:49,560
I'll tell you everything

648
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,353
So?

649
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:54,877
One is called Panza

650
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,230
The other is Attilio,
Giuseppe's brother

651
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:00,671
I don't know the other one, I swear.
I never saw him before

652
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:05,878
Giuseppe!

653
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:09,914
Take him to his cell

654
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:14,311
Let's go

655
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:20,709
He's gone up there!

656
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:30,797
Stop it

657
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:34,593
- Giuseppe
- Pasquale

658
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:37,234
- Did they hurt you?
- No. And you?

659
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:40,000
Me, neither.
Didn't they use the belt on you?

660
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:43,670
No, they were only kidding.
You haven't said anything, have you?

661
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:46,792
No, I haven't

662
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:51,232
What are you doing here?
Damn you!

663
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:54,557
What did he want?

664
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:57,433
He wanted to know
if they'd beaten me up

665
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:06,075
- What happened?
- Nothing, why?

666
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:10,592
- You've got a look on your face
- It's my face. If you don't like it...

667
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,631
...don't look at it!

668
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:28,239
I'll go on my own from here,
otherwise Mum will get scared

669
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:30,476
- Do you have a visitor?
- No

670
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:32,716
- Then why did you come here?
- Well...

671
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:36,831
- Mario, take him upstairs
- I'm busy

672
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,598
Keep an eye on him

673
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:40,518
Come here

674
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:48,679
- Where's my mother?
- Mrs Di Dio!

675
00:48:57,640 --> 00:48:58,630
I'm here

676
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:03,439
- Where's my mother?
- She sent me here

677
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:06,029
She wrote asking me
to come to see you. Look

678
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:11,432
- But where is she?
- She had to go to Florence

679
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:13,551
But she'll come here soon

680
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:17,150
I brought you a parcel
full of nice things

681
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:18,679
Thank you

682
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:22,479
Bye, dear. Take care of yourself

683
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:25,433
- Goodbye
- Goodbye

684
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:06,479
Pasquale, my mother is here.
See you outside!

685
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:09,797
- Giuseppe!
- What are you doing? Move it

686
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:23,551
Mum!

687
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:31,275
Can you forgive me, Mum?

688
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:41,717
How could you do it?

689
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:44,434
It's not my fault,
we didn't know anything

690
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:46,437
We haven't done anything

691
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:52,037
I know he's a delinquent,
a scoundrel

692
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:55,790
But he's your brother,
you shouldn't have betrayed him

693
00:50:57,560 --> 00:51:01,394
- What are you talking about?
- No need to pretend

694
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:04,990
The Chief made it clear
that it was you two who talked

695
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,118
Attilio is nothing to Pasquale, but...

696
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:10,639
...to you...

697
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:26,394
Come on, don't be stupid!

698
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:32,478
"Kiss Raffaele for me. Tell him
that his mother will be back soon...

699
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:36,673
..."and she'll bring money to pay
the lawyer, so he'll get out quickly

700
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:40,634
"I like Florence very much,
it's better than Rome

701
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:43,752
- "Yours, Teresa Di Dio"
- Good

702
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:45,359
- Is Florence far?
- No

703
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:47,835
A friend of mine drives there
once a week

704
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:49,951
Then it's close

705
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:54,599
- Have one, Pasquale
- No, thanks

706
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:58,117
Help yourselves

707
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:01,835
Leave it. It's his stuff.
He needs it because he's sick

708
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:22,636
- You grassed!
- I thought they'd beaten you up!

709
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:26,833
- You grassed!
- Wait, let me explain!

710
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:30,271
You're a grass!
Grass! Get away from me!

711
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:33,957
What's happening?

712
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:36,720
As soon as you have
a bit of freedom...

713
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:39,673
...you take advantage of it.
What happened?

714
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:41,313
- He's a grass
- No

715
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:45,877
Behave, boys. I don't want to get
into trouble because of you

716
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:50,551
Behave! I don't want to rot in here
because of you

717
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:53,035
Behave!

718
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:55,834
Behave, boys

719
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:59,955
- I need to talk to you
- What do you want?

720
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:02,117
- None of your business
- Says who?

721
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:03,560
Me

722
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:06,320
Napoli, you have it easy
because you're ill...

723
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:08,829
...but you'd better watch out

724
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:12,237
OK. So, can I talk to you?

725
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:15,796
If you're here on behalf of that grass,
save your breath

726
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:18,196
Especially with your lungs

727
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:20,793
Well done, good answer

728
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:23,354
Arcangeli

729
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:28,519
Go, Giuseppe. It's the right moment

730
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:31,109
- You swore you'd go
- Or else you're a coward

731
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:34,471
What are you talking about?
Of course he'll go

732
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,276
Mr Staff era, in cell 9
they have a file

733
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:44,392
- What?
- They're hiding a file

734
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:50,357
Damn it!

735
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:54,235
- Surely I could've convinced him
- Thanks, but it wasn't a good idea

736
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:56,476
He's the one who has to apologise

737
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:59,638
What?
But you were such good friends

738
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:03,515
- It's a shame
- I still like him, but if he...

739
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:06,399
Those in cell 9

740
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,631
Whose file is this?

741
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:26,957
- Whose file is this?
- I don't know

742
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:29,356
- Whose file is this?
- I swear by...

743
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:31,994
- Whose file is this?
- Never seen it before

744
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:34,555
- Whose file is this?
- I don't know

745
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:38,393
Get out!
Whose file is this?

746
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:40,591
I swear on my honour that...

747
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:44,753
- Who sleeps here?
- Me

748
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:47,315
- The file was in your mattress
- Impossible

749
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:49,556
Are you saying that I'm a liar?

750
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,956
No, but it's not mine,
I haven't put it there

751
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:55,835
- You're accusing your mates?
- I'm not accusing anybody!

752
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:58,554
The file's yours.
What were you going to do?

753
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:01,513
Nothing. Nobody gave it to me.
It's not mine!

754
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:03,790
Get out, all of you!

755
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:14,240
No, no, enough!

756
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:19,836
Enough! Enough!

757
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:24,511
- No, enough!
- Stop it! Stop it!

758
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:54,478
Lock them in!

759
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,389
- Stop crying!
- Whiner!

760
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:24,511
He sent your brother to jail

761
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:27,359
Now everybody will know
it was you who told Staff era

762
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:30,313
Dry your tears, little boy!

763
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:33,549
Staff era's coming

764
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:38,994
- What's your name?
- Filippucci, Giuseppe

765
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:42,113
Well done

766
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:47,910
If he makes you head of the group,
we're sorted!

767
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:52,554
I can't believe this guy!
What an idiot!

768
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:24,958
Stop it!

769
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:31,514
- Are you ill?
- I'm burning all over

770
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:36,430
You have to go for a medical visit.
The doctor has an excellent ointment

771
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:39,154
I wonder who put that file there

772
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:42,557
When I find out, I swear to God
that I'll give him a thrashing

773
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:44,512
Even if I end up in Regina Coeli!

774
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:48,554
But everybody in here
thinks you're a grass

775
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:51,433
But it's not true!

776
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:58,874
Napoli, what's the truth?
Did he grass or not?

777
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:39,317
Damn you! You could have told me

778
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:41,795
Not even Raffaele believed me
at first

779
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:44,912
- Me?
- Yes. Imagine the others

780
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:47,429
But I don't care
if they believe me or not

781
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:50,029
I just want to know
who put the file there

782
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:52,515
Forget about it. It's done now

783
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:55,439
- What?
- I meant... Well...

784
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:58,473
Tomorrow I'll talk to Giuseppe.
You have to make up

785
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:02,070
- Whatever
- Don't worry, I'll convince him

786
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:08,872
It's impossible to sleep in here.
Give over!

787
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:16,239
- It's freezing!
- Change over!

788
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:20,311
Next lot!

789
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:24,150
Damn, it's really cold!

790
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:44,236
- I've spoken to him. Come
- He has to come to me

791
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:46,749
You two are really difficult

792
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:49,998
He says you have to come,
you say he has to come

793
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:53,556
Just find a compromise
and meet halfway, OK?

794
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:57,196
- OK, let's meet halfway
- Finally!

795
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:02,792
Damn! That was some beating
they gave you

796
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:05,196
- Did you see the doctor?
- No

797
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:07,391
Careful, don't use the soap

798
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:09,875
- Does it hurt?
- Yes, but it'll go away

799
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,880
Have you made up your mind?
Damn, you're dragging this out!

800
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,277
Have you told him
who put the file in the mattress?

801
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:21,553
No, I haven't. And I haven't told him
who asked me to do it either

802
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:24,069
Go ahead and tell him

803
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:29,119
- What shall I do?
- Whatever you want

804
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:33,438
If you want to make peace with a guy
who sent your brother to prison

805
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:36,359
Didn't you hear what Righetto said?

806
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:40,189
- He thought they were beating me
- If you listen to this idiot...

807
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:44,359
Idiot? Watch your mouth!
It's the truth, Giuseppe. Go

808
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:06,395
Come on, Arcangeli!
Come on, Arcangeli!

809
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:10,115
- Come on, Arcangeli!
- Come on!

810
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:14,598
- Come on! Come on, Arcangeli!
- Come on, Pasquale!

811
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:26,518
- Come on, Pasquale!
- Come on!

812
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:35,758
Come on, Pasquale! Come on!

813
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:51,235
Help! Help! They're killing him!

814
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:16,397
"Violent by nature.
Dangerous to himself and others

815
01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:18,636
"We recommend isolation"

816
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:24,713
Master!

817
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:27,153
Master!

818
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:30,196
- What?
- I need to go to the loo

819
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:33,073
- You have a bowl there
- Yes, but afterwards...

820
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:37,080
It's not my problem. You're the one
staying in there, not me

821
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:53,591
- Is that meant to be a horse?
- What do you know?

822
01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:55,916
I hate horses, they're too slow

823
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:58,429
You haven't seen Bersagliere,
he flies

824
01:03:58,560 --> 01:04:01,279
- Who's Bersagliere?
- Never mind

825
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:17,472
- Give me a cigarette
- We don't have any

826
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:21,511
- I've been to the infirmary
- We can see that!

827
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:26,833
Idiots! I've got everything ready
to make an escape

828
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:32,509
But I'm an idiot wasting my time
talking to you guys

829
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:34,631
No, we want to listen

830
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:43,754
- I can't organise anything with you
- But we're ready

831
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:46,713
Shut up!
I won't discuss anything with you

832
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:49,116
- What've I done?
- Made up with Pasquale

833
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:50,958
- True
- No, it isn't

834
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:55,756
When I saw you on the floor
looking almost dead...

835
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:58,952
Anyway,
when entering the infirmary...

836
01:04:59,080 --> 01:05:01,469
- Damn you!
- Shut up, will you?

837
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:04,274
Carry on

838
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:08,473
The fence is fastened to the wall
with an iron bar

839
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:12,480
I've prepared everything.
I've cut through many bolts

840
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:15,433
You just need to shake it hard
to break it open

841
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:20,157
From the window to the roof
is less than two metres

842
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:21,918
Filippucci?

843
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:24,236
- Yes?
- There's a visitor

844
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:36,111
- Here he is, sir
- Thank you

845
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:37,594
Sit down

846
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:41,111
We have much to discuss.
My name's Bonavino, I'm your lawyer

847
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:45,711
Your family has hired me
to defend you and your brother...

848
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:49,349
...Attilio...Attilio Filippucci

849
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:51,357
- You're Giuseppe, yes?
- Yes

850
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:54,154
- Your friend is Pasquale Maggi?
- Yes

851
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:58,160
- Has his family found a lawyer yet?
- He has no family

852
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:00,713
Good. We're sorted

853
01:06:00,840 --> 01:06:04,674
Our defence is that
you were forced against your will

854
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:08,475
You'll say that Maggi incited you
to commit crimes

855
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:09,920
Incfied?

856
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:15,830
You'll say you knew nothing
and your friend knew everything

857
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:19,669
Pasquale knew nothing.
My brother organised everything

858
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:23,998
Say that in court and your brother
will serve at least five years

859
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:26,714
- But it's true
- That's for your confessor

860
01:06:26,840 --> 01:06:29,070
In court you say what I tell you

861
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:33,592
This horse couldn't have been
bought with hard-earned money...

862
01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:35,791
...as the defence wants us to believe

863
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:38,594
He was bought with money
from stolen goods

864
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:43,237
- But the goods have been found
- Where's the horse now?

865
01:06:43,360 --> 01:06:44,998
Don't answer!

866
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:48,511
If I didn't know you well, I'd think
that in your vocabulary...

867
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:51,234
...the term "horse"
is synonymous with "fee"

868
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:55,194
- Are you joking?
- Why did you buy the horse?

869
01:06:57,240 --> 01:07:00,471
- To ride him
- To ride him, eh?

870
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:05,117
- It's the truth
- How much did you plan to earn?

871
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:09,436
Sergeant, bring in Maggi

872
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:19,629
May I remind the court that in
the documents Maggi is described...

873
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:22,878
...as violent by nature
and isolation is recommended

874
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,798
When did you buy the horse?

875
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:28,550
Excuse me, Your Honour,
why is this horse so important?

876
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:33,914
I think it's important. Are you
defending Maggi or the Filippuccis?

877
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:36,395
Filippuccis.
I've been hired by the family

878
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:38,909
Maggi is with Scardone,
the public defender

879
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:42,192
How much did each of you
own of the horse?

880
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:44,914
How much did each of you put in?

881
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:48,874
- We did fifty-fifty
- Did you put it in writing?

882
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,195
No

883
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:56,077
If you had a dispute over ownership,
what would you do?

884
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:58,111
Where have you hidden the horse?

885
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:01,153
Don't answer!
The accused doesn't have to answer

886
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:36,594
Who is she?

887
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:40,679
I don't know.
Maybe it's Queen Margherita

888
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:55,959
- Excuse us
- Where are you going? Hold on

889
01:08:56,080 --> 01:08:58,230
You can't go in. Stop!

890
01:08:58,360 --> 01:09:01,000
Let us in!

891
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:08,195
A Roman Emperor, I can't recall
his name at the moment...

892
01:09:08,320 --> 01:09:11,119
...made his horse a Senator

893
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:13,038
He speaks really well

894
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:16,755
So, why be surprised
if two poor kids...

895
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:19,918
...two kids living on the street,
put all their love...

896
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:24,000
...all their hopes, on a horse?

897
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:25,519
He saw me

898
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:27,677
- What's he talking about?
- A horse

899
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:30,189
- Ever ride one?
- No, but I'd like to try

900
01:09:30,320 --> 01:09:32,880
- Keep quiet!
- Who's talking?

901
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:37,597
You don't need to be a psychologist
to understand the strong influence...

902
01:09:37,720 --> 01:09:42,590
...that Maggi had on his friend,
the little innocent Giuseppe

903
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:47,635
Just look at him
Who wouldn't want him as a son?

904
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:51,719
I'm not accusing Maggi.
That's the district attorney's job

905
01:09:51,840 --> 01:09:54,992
Come on, you have to be strong

906
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:58,317
- My poor sons
- Don't be like that, Anna

907
01:09:58,440 --> 01:10:00,431
- Wouldn't it be better to go in?
- No

908
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:04,793
Return these innocents to their
homes, families, schools, jobs

909
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:06,991
This is no crime

910
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:09,111
If you think they're guilty...

911
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:12,392
...then this court must condemn
all of us too -...

912
01:10:12,520 --> 01:10:15,114
...the people who -
in pursuit of our passions -...

913
01:10:15,240 --> 01:10:18,073
...abandon our children
to fend for themselves...

914
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:20,350
...children who are all alone

915
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:26,318
Mr Scardone, your turn

916
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:47,596
I'll be brief, as usual

917
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:54,160
After all, I haven't had the time
to delve into the details of this case

918
01:10:56,080 --> 01:11:00,199
Therefore, I will entrust my client...

919
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:03,119
...to the paternal clemency
of this court...

920
01:11:03,240 --> 01:11:07,234
...in requesting a complete acquittal
on his behalf...

921
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:09,397
...or a very light sentence

922
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:12,271
Very--- ...

923
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:14,630
...very light

924
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:30,716
Marcello, come!

925
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:37,955
We also sentence
the minors Maggi, Pasquale...

926
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:42,790
...to two years and six months
in prison and a 2,000-lira fine...

927
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:46,356
...and Filippucci Giuseppe
to one year in prison...

928
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:49,279
...and a 1,000-lira fine,
without appeal

929
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:54,793
Giuseppe, Giuseppe!
You bastards! You villains!

930
01:12:06,520 --> 01:12:09,319
Here they come!

931
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:19,069
Poor boys, my poor sons!

932
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:21,549
Giuseppe!

933
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:29,676
Attilio!

934
01:13:09,320 --> 01:13:11,311
Oh, here he is, at last!

935
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:14,239
We were starting to think
they'd shot you

936
01:13:14,360 --> 01:13:16,670
How did it go?

937
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:19,553
I got a year, but I don't care.
Where's Arcangeli?

938
01:13:19,680 --> 01:13:21,956
Gone to see his mother
for the money

939
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:24,276
- You haven't changed your mind?
- No way!

940
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:27,597
This morning Sicilia and I
went to the infirmary

941
01:13:27,720 --> 01:13:29,711
He's still there. Everything is ready

942
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:33,595
I'd love to see the district
attorney's face after my escape!

943
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:36,553
- How did it go for Pasquale?
- He got two years

944
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:38,512
- Bloody hell!
- Why?

945
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:42,029
What happened?

946
01:13:42,160 --> 01:13:44,879
- She didn't come. She sent my dad
- So?

947
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,991
- What?
- Let's escape anyway

948
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:49,191
Without money,
they'd catch us in no time

949
01:13:49,320 --> 01:13:54,269
What about me? I got one year.
I don't want to stay in here

950
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:56,198
I want to get out!

951
01:13:56,320 --> 01:14:00,553
Shut up, idiot!
You're going to ruin everything

952
01:14:00,680 --> 01:14:03,433
You're worried about one year?
What can I say, you idiot?

953
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:07,440
You can't escape with no money.
So I asked my mum for 10,000

954
01:14:07,560 --> 01:14:09,949
But that imbecile spoke to my father...

955
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:12,390
...and now he wants
to talk to the director

956
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:17,993
He'll have me put in isolation.
He wants me to pay for it, damn him!

957
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:20,350
In his eyes, I've disgraced the family

958
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:23,632
- I have money
- Where?

959
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:27,598
- I've got it
- How much?

960
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:32,114
More than 50,000 lira

961
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:36,991
- Here they come!
- Here come the entertainers!

962
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:39,556
What are you showing tonight?

963
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:43,036
- Something good?
- Show us some naked legs!

964
01:14:43,160 --> 01:14:45,720
A comedy would be better!

965
01:14:56,920 --> 01:14:59,719
- It's a movie
- Big deal

966
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:04,038
Last time they showed us cartoons
as if we were still little children

967
01:15:04,160 --> 01:15:07,710
I like it.
In my village there's no cinema

968
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:10,593
Did you come to prison for that?

969
01:15:10,720 --> 01:15:13,234
Lucky you

970
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:17,672
In here they feed us, they shelter us,
they give us clothes...

971
01:15:17,800 --> 01:15:21,759
...and they even entertain us.
What else could we want?

972
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:25,271
This is paradise!

973
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:29,074
NEWS FROM THE FREE WORLD

974
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:43,840
In the Pacific Ocean,
General MacArthur continues...

975
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:46,520
...the successful campaign
against the Japanese

976
01:15:54,640 --> 01:16:00,192
Bouganville's been targeted by
the US air, sea and ground forces...

977
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:02,834
...in an attack by destroyers

978
01:16:03,640 --> 01:16:05,517
Look, Pasquale, the sea

979
01:16:42,680 --> 01:16:45,069
The American forces
have disembarked

980
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:47,669
They're one step closer
to Japan itself

981
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:57,989
Open it. Open the window!

982
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:13,437
Lights!

983
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:29,914
Lights, please

984
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:13,471
Stop laughing!

985
01:18:20,840 --> 01:18:22,990
BOy5!

986
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:25,680
What are you doing up there?

987
01:18:28,160 --> 01:18:29,958
Idiots! We've been caught!

988
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:33,550
- You could have waited a bit!
- Open up!

989
01:18:33,680 --> 01:18:37,116
- What happened?
- They've locked themselves inside

990
01:18:37,240 --> 01:18:40,358
- How many of them?
- I've seen two

991
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:43,074
Open up, boys! Open up!

992
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:53,595
Open up, boys!

993
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:00,794
Stop! Lights!

994
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:08,032
Lights! Lights!

995
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,991
Calm down, for God's sake!
Calm down!

996
01:19:38,120 --> 01:19:40,191
There's no danger.
Turn on the lights

997
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:42,951
Lights! Lights!

998
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:54,159
Master! Master!

999
01:19:54,280 --> 01:19:56,510
Master, it's Raffaele!

1000
01:19:56,640 --> 01:19:59,359
Quick, let's take him to the infirmary

1001
01:20:02,720 --> 01:20:05,712
Move out of the way!

1002
01:20:18,520 --> 01:20:21,114
Open up! Open UP!

1003
01:20:21,680 --> 01:20:24,672
Open up, boys! Open up!

1004
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:32,592
Boys! Boys, come back!

1005
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:35,760
Boys, come back or I'll shoot you!

1006
01:20:35,880 --> 01:20:39,874
Boys, think about what you're doing!
Boys!

1007
01:20:41,400 --> 01:20:43,676
Boys! Boys!

1008
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:47,919
- I want to leave, too!
- Go, go!

1009
01:20:48,040 --> 01:20:50,236
Take him back to his cell

1010
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:53,159
- Five or six have escaped
- Sound the alarm

1011
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:56,033
Surround the building

1012
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:10,673
- Where's your cell?
- I want to see him

1013
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:12,950
Tomorrow.
We're waiting for the doctor

1014
01:21:13,080 --> 01:21:15,799
- Then he's not dead?
- Let's hope not. Come on

1015
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:18,753
- Let's go
- Take them to their cells

1016
01:21:20,680 --> 01:21:22,273
To their cells!

1017
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:24,755
- Arcangeli's escaped
- Who else?

1018
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:28,350
- Arcangeli, Giuseppe and other five
- There were more than 20

1019
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:31,199
- Napoli is dead
- But they caught them

1020
01:21:31,320 --> 01:21:33,675
Idiot! They had a car waiting outside

1021
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:35,791
- And a horse, too
- A horse?

1022
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:38,230
- Let's go
- What horse?

1023
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:41,113
A horse?
Where did they keep a horse?

1024
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:49,392
- The guards!
- The guards!

1025
01:21:52,160 --> 01:21:54,595
- Stop!
- Stop there, boys!

1026
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:16,158
Come on, come on!

1027
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:32,394
Bartoli, get the forms ready
for tomorrow

1028
01:22:32,520 --> 01:22:35,717
And the report. One page is enough

1029
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:40,835
- I might not be here tomorrow
- Where will you be?

1030
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:43,156
This isn't the right place for me

1031
01:22:43,280 --> 01:22:46,159
I don't even know where
the right place for me is...

1032
01:22:46,280 --> 01:22:51,798
...but in here you need people
stronger than me, much stronger

1033
01:22:52,840 --> 01:22:55,354
There was nothing that could be done

1034
01:22:55,480 --> 01:22:59,360
This poor kid...
his days were numbered

1035
01:23:00,720 --> 01:23:03,473
Don Biagioni, I'm sorry. It's my fault

1036
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:06,638
- It's my fault
- Calm down. It was an accident

1037
01:23:06,760 --> 01:23:09,149
We caught them.
We're missing only two...

1038
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:12,477
...Arcangeli and Filippucci,
the one who was sentenced today

1039
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:15,069
We've informed the police.
They won't get far

1040
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:19,194
- Do you think they could leave town?
- Where could they go?

1041
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:22,149
With no money
and dressed as inmates...

1042
01:23:22,280 --> 01:23:24,271
...they can't go around naked

1043
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:26,835
Unless the families help them,
but I doubt it

1044
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:31,033
I know Dr Arcangeli, and Filippucci
comes from a poor family

1045
01:23:31,160 --> 01:23:34,551
We'll have so many problems
with the department

1046
01:23:37,480 --> 01:23:38,754
Mr Staff era!

1047
01:23:40,440 --> 01:23:44,070
- What do you want?
- I know where they've gone

1048
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:49,873
- Who?
- Arcangeli and Giuseppe

1049
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:51,593
Where?

1050
01:23:53,720 --> 01:23:55,711
I'll take you there

1051
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:41,194
He's not here. They've taken him

1052
01:24:41,320 --> 01:24:43,197
Look over there!

1053
01:24:45,640 --> 01:24:46,914
What happened?

1054
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:51,113
My head hurts.
He beat me up, the big one...

1055
01:24:51,240 --> 01:24:55,837
- Where did they go?
- I don't know. They wanted the horse

1056
01:24:55,960 --> 01:24:57,951
They said it was theirs

1057
01:24:58,080 --> 01:25:00,993
My head hurts. They beat me up

1058
01:25:01,120 --> 01:25:05,034
The bigger one. Vile...

1059
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:38,837
Get down!

1060
01:26:17,720 --> 01:26:19,518
Giuseppe!

1061
01:26:19,640 --> 01:26:21,711
Giuseppe!

1062
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:24,958
Giuseppe! Giuseppe!

1063
01:26:25,080 --> 01:26:27,594
Giuseppe! No!

1064
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:32,879
What have I done?

1065
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:34,911
Giuseppe!

1066
01:26:36,040 --> 01:26:38,236
Giuseppe!

1067
01:26:38,920 --> 01:26:42,072
Giuseppe!

1068
01:26:42,200 --> 01:26:45,431
Giuseppe!

1069
01:26:45,560 --> 01:26:49,554
Oh, my God! What have I done?

1070
01:26:49,680 --> 01:26:51,990
What have I done?

1071
01:26:52,120 --> 01:26:54,919
Giuseppe!

1072
01:26:57,640 --> 01:26:59,756
Giuseppe!

1073
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:07,909
THE END
