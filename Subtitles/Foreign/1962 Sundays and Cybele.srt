1
00:01:47,983 --> 00:01:52,487
SUNDAYS AND CYBELE

2
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:04,393
Let go of me, please.

3
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:07,938
I don’t want to go. Take me
back to Granny. I’ll be good.

4
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:09,898
That’s enough now. Be quiet.

5
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,025
I don’t want to go there.

6
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,738
Come along. Will you come along?

7
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:26,540
Excuse me, but could
you please direct me

8
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:28,709
to St. Marguerite’s?

9
00:03:32,421 --> 00:03:36,299
St. Marguerite’s boarding
school. You know where that is?

10
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:39,469
No. This is Ville d’Avray.

11
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:42,597
Yes, I know. It’s in Ville d’Avray.

12
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:44,057
Oh...

13
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:46,435
Come on. We’ll ask
someone from around here.

14
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,061
I don’t want to go!

15
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,021
I’ve already told you!

16
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:53,108
You’ll make friends.
Everyone will be nice to you.

17
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:57,070
I’ll come see you on
Sundays, and if you’re good,

18
00:03:57,195 --> 00:04:01,199
at Christmas I’ll bring
you a very nice present.

19
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,714
That’s enough now.

20
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:20,218
- Why is she crying?
- It’s nothing. It will pass.

21
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:21,761
She mustn’t cry.

22
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:24,473
Excuse me. I know what I’m doing.

23
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:26,808
Come along now. That’s enough!

24
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,355
She mustn’t cry.

25
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:52,209
Take one.

26
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,592
Take one.

27
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:03,220
They’re pieces of a star.

28
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,847
It fell from the sky.

29
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:17,275
No, thank you.

30
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,236
I can’t.

31
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:23,698
I was just kidding.

32
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:27,035
It’s water.

33
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,664
It’s just water.

34
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,792
If you’ll excuse us. Come along.

35
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:10,555
Ah, the new girl. You’ve
brought her very late.

36
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:14,476
- Forgive me. I couldn’t - -
Are you related to the child?

37
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,811
I’m her father.

38
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:22,150
Come, my child. I’ll take
you to Mother Superior.

39
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:24,402
You hear that?

40
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,824
Come, my child. It’s very late.

41
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:39,000
You’ll be back soon, right?

42
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,002
On Sunday?

43
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:44,839
Be good. You’re a big girl now.

44
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:48,802
Good night, Sister.

45
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:51,680
Slam the gate hard. It’s very heavy.

46
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,869
Well, well! I thought you’d left.

47
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:42,457
- Did you see a man running?
- The fellow in the raincoat?

48
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:45,960
Another nutcase buying his ticket
when the train’s already leaving.

49
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:49,088
“Wait for the next
one,” I say. “Impossible!

50
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:52,050
My plane leaves in an
hour. I can’t miss it!”

51
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:53,426
Platform two.

52
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:55,970
And he thrusts his ticket under my nose.

53
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:58,556
“All right, just this
once, but next time

54
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:01,184
“Don’t worry! I’m never coming back!”

55
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:03,144
Never coming back?

56
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:06,439
Anyway...

57
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,858
you know him?

58
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:02,287
He’s never coming back.

59
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:15,466
“Ruined.” What does
that mean, a ruined life?

60
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:17,886
When you haven’t been able

61
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,306
to do what you wanted.

62
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:28,313
A life where you’ve been unlucky.

63
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:34,110
A life like mine?

64
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,655
Pierre...

65
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,950
why do you say that?

66
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:45,413
Aren’t you happy with me?

67
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:48,416
I’m nothing.

68
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,251
I’m nothing anymore.

69
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:53,421
Pierre, you’re not being reasonable.

70
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:56,591
Just think.

71
00:11:57,425 --> 00:12:01,304
Only a year ago you
couldn’t even go out alone.

72
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:04,641
You were still having
those horrible headaches.

73
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:10,730
Now you’re a man again.

74
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:13,650
My man...

75
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:16,778
Now I just walk around and wait!

76
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,948
And my memory’s not coming back.

77
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,663
Luckily, there are the trees.

78
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:30,458
And in the evening I go to the station

79
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:32,502
and wait for you.

80
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,383
I’m unhappy, Madeleine.

81
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:43,429
I still don’t know who I am.

82
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:49,477
Maybe you know...

83
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:53,064
but you won’t tell me.

84
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:55,692
Darling, don’t be cruel.

85
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:04,200
You know very well
you mustn’t look back.

86
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:09,831
The doctor told you that.
- The doctor’s not inside my head!

87
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:14,460
What happened today?

88
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:16,170
Nothing.

89
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:18,423
I was at the station, and -

90
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:22,010
That’s all.

91
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:24,679
Are you sure?

92
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:27,390
Ask the attendant.

93
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:29,892
He’ll tell you.

94
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:36,065
I believe you.

95
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:45,366
You should get undressed now, darling.

96
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:38,669
Do you still love me a little?

97
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,632
Yes.

98
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:14,372
Will you go see Carlos?

99
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:17,041
Yes, we’ve started on the birdcage.

100
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:21,087
Another Sunday without you.
It’s going on six weeks now.

101
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:23,756
You remember how we
used to go for walks?

102
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:26,259
But after Christmas
I’ll have Sundays off.

103
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:28,469
Won’t that be wonderful?

104
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:53,327
Would you like a little
more? There’s some left.

105
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:57,457
- No, thanks, Carmela.
- How’s Madeleine?

106
00:15:57,999 --> 00:16:00,668
Tell her she’s becoming
quite a stranger.

107
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:02,962
Pierre...

108
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:05,548
look what I found for the aviary.

109
00:16:13,014 --> 00:16:15,766
Don’t turn it down. Let us listen.

110
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:19,896
It has to be loud.
- You weren’t even listening.

111
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:23,524
Yes, we were. It just
didn’t look like it.

112
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:26,569
But you’ll never understand.

113
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:29,530
Actually, I don’t care.
I know it by heart.

114
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,782
No, be quiet.

115
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:41,751
This part is the end of the ceremony.

116
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,546
They’ve cast a spell on the universe.

117
00:16:46,214 --> 00:16:48,090
It’s in Tibet.

118
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:51,761
You feel the forces?

119
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:55,848
Imagine hearing that at night.

120
00:16:57,433 --> 00:17:01,646
Actually, you must have
heard things like that before.

121
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:04,065
Does it remind you of anything?

122
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:07,610
No, nothing.

123
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:11,322
But I like it.

124
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:14,158
Help me with this.

125
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:19,413
You wrap a wire around and tighten it.

126
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:22,917
And so on, right to the top.

127
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:25,628
It’ll be good and steady.

128
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,005
Beautiful, isn’t it?

129
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:15,261
Run along. Go for a walk.

130
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:17,805
We’ll continue tomorrow.

131
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:21,309
But no going to the station again, eh?

132
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,688
Because your past isn’t
coming back by train.

133
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:28,065
No, look at the trees.

134
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:31,235
People hide behind their masks,

135
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:34,071
and you think you’re
seeing the real thing.

136
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:36,282
It throws you.

137
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:38,826
Good-bye, Pierre. Say hi to Madeleine,

138
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:41,287
and tell her to come by more often.

139
00:18:41,996 --> 00:18:43,539
Trees are different.

140
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:46,250
Give it time and you’ll
really understand them.

141
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,919
Yes, trees help.

142
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:54,008
But if I look up for too
long, I feel ill, I feel -

143
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,552
Vertigo. I’ll tell you something.

144
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:59,639
The day you stop getting
vertigo, you’ll be cured.

145
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:01,640
You have to get there gradually.

146
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,518
It’s the same with water.

147
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:07,730
If I look too long...

148
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:11,942
I feel like I’m falling, and I feel ill.

149
00:19:14,028 --> 00:19:17,031
Don’t be afraid. Force yourself.

150
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:18,949
Look.

151
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,664
What are you waiting for? This is heavy!

152
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:10,376
- Delivering at this hour!
- I deliver when I can, Sister.

153
00:20:10,501 --> 00:20:12,962
My delivery boy’s
sick. I have to fill in.

154
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:16,716
At my age! And with a
bad heart since Verdun!

155
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:20,761
- And what do you want?
- I’ve come for that little girl.

156
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,388
What?

157
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:25,933
I’ve come for the
little girl over there.

158
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:31,731
You’re the new girl’s father?
You should come earlier next time.

159
00:20:34,442 --> 00:20:38,362
Frangoise, come here.
Someone’s here for you.

160
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:56,881
You’ve come for me?

161
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,049
Do you recognize me?

162
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:02,178
But where’s my father?

163
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:05,973
Are we going to join him?
- Yes, he sent me.

164
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:09,351
No later than 7:00, or
she can’t go out again.

165
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:11,312
Those are the rules.

166
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:20,321
I’m not surprised my father
sent you to take me out.

167
00:21:20,488 --> 00:21:24,283
When I stayed with my grandmother,
he was always putting it off.

168
00:21:24,492 --> 00:21:27,995
And all she thought about
was getting rid of me.

169
00:21:28,162 --> 00:21:30,831
When I think about it,
I’ve really had bad luck.

170
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:33,793
My mother ran off with a magician,

171
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:36,462
maybe because my father
would never marry her.

172
00:21:36,587 --> 00:21:39,048
And I’ve seen my father
three times in all.

173
00:21:39,173 --> 00:21:41,675
Pretty sad, don’t you think?

174
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:47,056
Weren’t you surprised when
the sister called me Frangoise?

175
00:21:47,181 --> 00:21:48,599
No. Why?

176
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:51,602
You know very well
that’s not my real name.

177
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:53,896
Did my father tell you my real name?

178
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:55,439
No.

179
00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:59,193
The nuns made a great fuss about it.

180
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:03,197
It’s not a Christian name,
so they call me Frangoise.

181
00:22:03,364 --> 00:22:05,699
Not that I really
care about the sisters.

182
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:07,785
- Tell me your name.
- Guess.

183
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:10,287
It’s very ancient, because
my grandmother’s Greek.

184
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:12,206
That’s where it comes from.

185
00:22:12,373 --> 00:22:14,667
You give up?
- What?

186
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:17,127
You don’t know? It’s a beautiful name.

187
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:19,672
Tell me. I’d like to know.

188
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,049
That would be too easy.

189
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:25,302
I’ll tell you if you
get me that steeple cock.

190
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,931
Isn’t it beautiful?

191
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:39,400
That other Sunday / had the feeling

192
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:41,861
I’d seen you before,

193
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:45,906
and I thought maybe you could help me.

194
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:51,370
He deserted me. I knew it was coming.

195
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:56,375
That day on the train, he was sad.

196
00:22:57,501 --> 00:23:00,671
He talked about a trip he was going on.

197
00:23:01,589 --> 00:23:04,925
When I asked him when, he didn’t answer.

198
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:09,638
I thought, “This is it.
I’ll be all alone again.”

199
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:14,268
I’ve dreaded it for a long time.

200
00:23:14,685 --> 00:23:17,438
When you came to get me for him,

201
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:19,607
I was glad.

202
00:23:21,609 --> 00:23:23,736
Then, as time went by,

203
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:28,115
I could tell from your
expression you had bad news.

204
00:23:28,324 --> 00:23:31,452
And that was it. I’m all alone.

205
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,461
Where did he go?

206
00:24:23,671 --> 00:24:25,339
I don’t know.

207
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:34,848
He explains in a letter

208
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:37,643
that your grandmother
can’t keep you anymore,

209
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:40,813
and that he has to go away.

210
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:44,942
That his life is ruined.

211
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:49,905
The letter’s in there.

212
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,538
But when you came for me,

213
00:24:57,663 --> 00:24:59,665
what did you tell Sister Opportune?

214
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:01,208
Nothing.

215
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:04,211
She thought I was your father.

216
00:25:04,795 --> 00:25:07,214
She took you for my father?

217
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:12,386
Still, it was wrong to
lie to me like you did.

218
00:25:12,678 --> 00:25:16,724
You’ve been telling me
nothing but fibs for two hours.

219
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:20,060
No, I really wanted to get to know you

220
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:22,104
so you’d help me.

221
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:25,941
But...

222
00:25:27,276 --> 00:25:29,153
it’s no use now.

223
00:25:32,448 --> 00:25:34,450
Well, too bad.

224
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:41,248
What should I tell the nuns?

225
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:46,545
Whatever you like.
It doesn’t matter now.

226
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:51,425
I’ll take you back.

227
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:56,597
What’s to become of me? My
grandmother doesn’t want me.

228
00:25:56,722 --> 00:25:58,849
My mother already abandoned me.

229
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:01,727
I wonder what’s to become of me.

230
00:26:09,485 --> 00:26:13,113
Let me stay with you! I don’t
want to go to an orphanage.

231
00:26:13,614 --> 00:26:14,948
I can’t.

232
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:17,451
Let me stay. I’ll be good.

233
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:20,913
If they send me to an
orphanage, I won’t have anyone.

234
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:24,416
Will you let me stay?

235
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:29,797
Why can’t you?

236
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:32,633
My grandmother said if
my father gave me up,

237
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,968
I’d be put in an orphanage.

238
00:26:38,472 --> 00:26:39,932
Quiet!

239
00:26:40,641 --> 00:26:42,226
Keep quiet.

240
00:26:43,477 --> 00:26:45,354
May I stay?

241
00:26:46,814 --> 00:26:50,692
I told you. I’m no good
for anything anymore.

242
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:55,405
You managed to take
me out this afternoon.

243
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:58,492
Yes, but if Madeleine found out,

244
00:26:58,659 --> 00:27:01,078
I wouldn’t be able to again.

245
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:04,456
Madeleine? Does she live here?

246
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:17,386
Why wouldn’t she like
it? Is she jealous?

247
00:27:17,511 --> 00:27:19,138
Perhaps.

248
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,266
Does she love you?

249
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:24,351
Yes.

250
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,353
And you?

251
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,734
Since you’re not married, she
has no right to be jealous.

252
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:39,241
What if we don’t say anything?

253
00:27:40,701 --> 00:27:42,661
Then it could work.

254
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:46,415
Not to let me stay here, but
to take me out on Sundays.

255
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:47,833
Sundays?

256
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:50,335
Yes. Is she here other Sundays?

257
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,921
Not right now. She’s on duty.

258
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:55,132
Then it’s simple.

259
00:27:55,591 --> 00:27:57,634
I’ll go back to the nuns.

260
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:00,178
I’d rather not, but I’ll have to.

261
00:28:00,304 --> 00:28:03,056
We won’t tell them anything,

262
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:05,184
or Madeleine either.

263
00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:08,145
Everyone will believe you’re my father.

264
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:13,567
You’ll see. It’ll be lots of fun.

265
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:17,237
I’ll be nice, and I’ll love you a lot.

266
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:21,158
Don’t leave me.
- I’ll come get you.

267
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:30,000
You won’t abandon me?

268
00:28:30,751 --> 00:28:32,920
Swear on my head.

269
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:34,588
What?

270
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:39,218
You put your hand on my
head and say, “I swear.”

271
00:28:39,343 --> 00:28:41,762
If you’re lying, I’ll die.

272
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:49,645
I swear.

273
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:03,367
Daddy!

274
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,831
Hello, Daddy.

275
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:13,293
Monsieur, bring her
back no later than 7:00.

276
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:16,129
And please leave the gate open.

277
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:26,306
I called you “Daddy”
because of the nuns.

278
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:28,433
I figured that out.

279
00:30:15,689 --> 00:30:17,524
Pierre, look.

280
00:30:20,444 --> 00:30:22,696
Look at the circles.

281
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:37,544
There. Now we’re home.

282
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:40,255
We’ve entered the circle.

283
00:30:40,881 --> 00:30:42,591
Come on.

284
00:30:47,721 --> 00:30:49,806
Look.

285
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:53,143
Sir Magician, will
you give me this tree?

286
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:16,291
Pierre, what’s the matter?

287
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:18,251
I get vertigo.

288
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:20,879
Vertigo?

289
00:31:28,929 --> 00:31:30,597
It’s the water.

290
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:33,141
Sometimes...

291
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:37,104
it’s as if I were high
up and I were falling.

292
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:40,899
Good thing you don’t fix houses.
You’d be falling all the time.

293
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:44,444
You can only fall
once. Then you’re dead.

294
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,113
That depends.

295
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:49,783
You fell once, and in
an airplane, no less.

296
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:04,339
My father is dead.

297
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:06,967
- What?
- My father’s dead.

298
00:32:07,551 --> 00:32:08,802
No!

299
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:11,805
That’s just how it is. He’s dead.

300
00:32:12,139 --> 00:32:15,976
He’s never coming
back, right? Well, then?

301
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:19,229
I’ve even decided he’s been buried

302
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:22,399
and that you’re going
to show me his grave.

303
00:32:22,524 --> 00:32:25,318
Come show me where they buried the body.

304
00:32:47,591 --> 00:32:49,759
Where? There?

305
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:56,349
Tell me where.

306
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:58,268
Over there?

307
00:32:58,435 --> 00:32:59,978
Yes.

308
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:37,557
Thank you, God.

309
00:33:38,058 --> 00:33:40,060
You’ve taken my father

310
00:33:40,185 --> 00:33:43,730
but given me Pierre, who’s much nicer.

311
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:08,088
Pierre, how old are you?

312
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:09,965
Probably 30.

313
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:13,218
Thirty? And I’m 12, or almost.

314
00:34:13,343 --> 00:34:16,763
Let’s see: 12... 30, 13... 31,

315
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:19,766
14... 32, 15... 33,

316
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:21,601
16, 17-

317
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:24,187
You’ll be 36 when I’m 18.

318
00:34:24,396 --> 00:34:27,107
Thirty-six isn’t so old.

319
00:34:27,816 --> 00:34:31,653
We’ll get married when I’m
18. Would you like that?

320
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,488
I know I would.

321
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:37,242
I can cook, you know, and keep house.

322
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:40,745
I always shined the crystal
ball at my grandmother’s.

323
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:44,124
Did I tell you she was clairvoyant?

324
00:34:44,249 --> 00:34:46,793
I used to polish her magic knife.

325
00:34:47,002 --> 00:34:50,005
That’s something you don’t see a lot.

326
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:53,758
My grandmother has a very beautiful
knife with an ivory handle.

327
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:57,637
You know what sorcerers in
Africa do with a knife like that?

328
00:34:57,887 --> 00:35:02,017
They stick it in a tree, and
they can hear the spirits talking.

329
00:35:02,142 --> 00:35:04,602
Was your grandmother mean?

330
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:07,647
Not really.

331
00:35:08,148 --> 00:35:11,067
She always said I was
an extra mouth to feed,

332
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:13,361
but that I was nicer than my mother.

333
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:15,196
And your mother?

334
00:35:15,322 --> 00:35:18,241
I suppose you don’t remember her either.

335
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:22,329
It’s really quite sad.

336
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:25,165
Deep down, you’re like a lost child.

337
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:31,046
If you had things to say to your mother,

338
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:34,007
you can tell me instead, all right?

339
00:35:34,716 --> 00:35:37,510
If you knew how much I love you!

340
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:12,003
- How handsome he is!
- The horse?

341
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:14,339
Yes... and the rider too.

342
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:32,816
I wish he’d carry me off on his horse.

343
00:36:33,066 --> 00:36:35,318
With him I wouldn’t be afraid.

344
00:36:48,415 --> 00:36:50,417
Pierre, wait for me!

345
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:55,630
Why are you walking away?
- I don’t like the man on the horse.

346
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:57,590
To each his own.

347
00:36:57,924 --> 00:37:00,135
Don’t you love me anymore?

348
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:03,430
You said you didn’t want
to stay with me anymore.

349
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:05,098
Are you crazy?

350
00:37:05,432 --> 00:37:09,728
If you like, I’ll never go back to
school. I’ll stay with you always.

351
00:37:09,853 --> 00:37:11,938
I’m your fiancee, aren’t I?

352
00:37:13,106 --> 00:37:16,109
We’d better turn back.
You can buy me a soda.

353
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:17,944
I have no money.

354
00:37:18,153 --> 00:37:20,488
We’ll have to find a way.

355
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:23,116
We can’t live without money, you know,

356
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:25,785
and I’m too young to earn any.

357
00:37:29,456 --> 00:37:31,541
No, Pierre, wait.

358
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:35,962
My father didn’t want me
to take one that night.

359
00:37:36,129 --> 00:37:37,297
Take them all.

360
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:39,215
No, thank you.

361
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,092
This one’s beautiful.

362
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:43,720
They’re not really
pieces of a star, right?

363
00:37:44,846 --> 00:37:46,681
Where did you find them?

364
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:49,559
In the hand of a statue
at Carlos’s place.

365
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:52,687
I said they were pretty,
so he gave them to me.

366
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:54,898
Carlos is an artist.

367
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:59,402
I’m sure we wouldn’t
need to hide around him.

368
00:38:02,322 --> 00:38:04,324
Pierre, look.

369
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:36,981
What’s wrong?

370
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:39,859
I don’t know. Nothing.

371
00:38:40,068 --> 00:38:41,361
Nothing?

372
00:38:51,371 --> 00:38:53,331
Maybe I’m getting worse.

373
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:55,458
You have a headache?

374
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:57,877
No, it’s something else.

375
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:01,756
I feel strange.

376
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:06,719
Ever since we came out here, I’ve
forgotten to think about... before.

377
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:08,721
What do you mean?

378
00:39:09,097 --> 00:39:13,142
Other days I can’t stop
asking myself... Who was I?

379
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:15,144
Where do I come from?

380
00:39:15,395 --> 00:39:17,480
What did I used to do?

381
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:20,692
Today I forgot to think
about those things...

382
00:39:20,942 --> 00:39:23,069
and that frightens me.

383
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:26,072
When I grow up, I’ll study medicine

384
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:27,949
and make you all better.

385
00:39:32,704 --> 00:39:35,415
Madeleine? Hello.

386
00:39:35,582 --> 00:39:37,917
How is Pierre?
- Fine.

387
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:40,003
A friend just got married.

388
00:39:40,128 --> 00:39:43,006
We’re celebrating on
Sunday. Will you two join us?

389
00:39:43,131 --> 00:39:45,049
I’m on duty Sunday.

390
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:48,177
Felicie or Marguerite
could cover for you.

391
00:39:48,303 --> 00:39:51,639
- Good idea. Will you arrange it?
- Consider it done.

392
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:19,250
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit...

393
00:40:31,304 --> 00:40:34,057
You look like a calendar...

394
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:37,894
by Hokusai.

395
00:40:49,489 --> 00:40:51,366
It’s really good.

396
00:40:52,033 --> 00:40:54,118
You did a great job.

397
00:40:54,744 --> 00:40:57,830
While I think of it, take this.

398
00:40:58,122 --> 00:40:59,791
- For me?
- Of course.

399
00:40:59,916 --> 00:41:02,877
I’d have had to pay anyone else.

400
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:06,422
It’s amazing how much
better you seem lately.

401
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:08,174
Run along now.

402
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:24,190
It was no coincidence that we’d
arranged to meet that Sunday...

403
00:41:24,399 --> 00:41:28,027
If Mother Superior had been
there, we’d have been done for.

404
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:30,863
She’s terrible, and nosy too.

405
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:33,574
She never stops asking questions.

406
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:37,412
You’re such a bungler, we’d
have been in a real fix.

407
00:41:37,704 --> 00:41:41,666
You have to make sure
you never run into her.

408
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:45,545
Sister Marie des Anges
is different. She’s nice.

409
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:48,881
Did you see how flustered she
was because you were there?

410
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:51,217
I’m sure she thought
you were very handsome.

411
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:53,553
- Me?
- I’m sure of it.

412
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:57,348
She saw your eyes.
- Why did she ask for my address?

413
00:41:57,473 --> 00:42:01,352
It’s only natural. She
thinks you’re my father.

414
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:08,735
There. We’ve entered our home.

415
00:42:09,152 --> 00:42:11,738
I wondered if you’d forget our ceremony.

416
00:42:11,904 --> 00:42:14,699
No. With you I never forget anything.

417
00:42:45,188 --> 00:42:46,731
Hello.

418
00:42:48,775 --> 00:42:52,779
- That’s Pierre, Madeleine’s boyfriend.
- You think that’s his daughter?

419
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:57,950
How’s the fishing?

420
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:03,581
Pierre, look!

421
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:06,292
You see what that
strange fellow is doing?

422
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:18,095
He has some nerve. That’s my tree.

423
00:43:18,346 --> 00:43:20,306
He has no right.

424
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:23,601
Don’t you like my painting?

425
00:43:24,644 --> 00:43:26,896
It’s pretty, isn’t it?

426
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:31,984
It’s a good likeness.

427
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:35,279
That’s not what I mean. It’s my tree.

428
00:43:35,404 --> 00:43:39,158
Someone I love gave it to me.
I don’t want it taken away.

429
00:43:39,325 --> 00:43:41,953
I’m not taking it away. I’m drawing it.

430
00:43:42,078 --> 00:43:45,289
Same thing. It’s my very own tree.

431
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:47,875
Children are charming but cruel...

432
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,293
of course.

433
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:53,464
When I see something
beautiful, I have to paint it.

434
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:55,341
I can’t help it.

435
00:43:55,591 --> 00:43:58,719
But my only spare time is on Sundays.

436
00:43:58,845 --> 00:44:01,931
On top of that, my wife disapproves.

437
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:04,350
She doesn’t appreciate my passion.

438
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:08,062
- What’s your name?
- Come play with us.

439
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:12,525
And when I say she disapproves,

440
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:15,945
that’s putting it very kindly.

441
00:44:21,951 --> 00:44:24,829
Pierre, may I go play blindman’s bluff?

442
00:44:24,954 --> 00:44:27,081
Just one game, okay?

443
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:38,009
You’re it.

444
00:44:49,979 --> 00:44:52,148
Come on, hide!

445
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:28,476
Who hit you, Charles?
That man over there?

446
00:45:28,601 --> 00:45:30,311
Yes.

447
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:35,191
You big brute, you should be ashamed!

448
00:45:35,316 --> 00:45:37,276
Are you crazy?

449
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:40,738
I’m calling my husband. Fernand!

450
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:42,698
Creep!

451
00:45:43,491 --> 00:45:45,159
What’s wrong?

452
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:47,453
How dare you ask that!

453
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:50,081
I could have been attacked
and your son killed,

454
00:45:50,206 --> 00:45:52,249
while you’re off playing battleships!

455
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:01,634
Pierre, you’re very mean.

456
00:46:01,801 --> 00:46:04,929
You don’t hit someone
smaller than yourself.

457
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:17,566
Don’t cry.

458
00:46:17,984 --> 00:46:20,152
Don’t cry anymore.

459
00:46:20,653 --> 00:46:22,989
He was annoying you.

460
00:46:24,532 --> 00:46:26,283
That’s not true.

461
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:30,621
You don’t understand
at all. We were playing.

462
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:33,249
And you -

463
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:39,505
Even my mean grandmother
never slapped me.

464
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:41,549
I’ll never do it again.

465
00:46:41,674 --> 00:46:43,300
I promise.

466
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:46,470
I should hope not.

467
00:46:46,846 --> 00:46:51,225
Or else I won’t love you
anymore, and I’ll never marry you.

468
00:46:51,559 --> 00:46:53,853
You’ll be left all alone.

469
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:18,836
Why do you look at him like that?

470
00:47:19,211 --> 00:47:22,590
I’m sure he would
never hit a little boy.

471
00:47:22,923 --> 00:47:25,259
But he doesn’t know you.

472
00:47:27,386 --> 00:47:30,556
Pierre, would you by
any chance be jealous?

473
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:37,688
Want to be a sweetheart?
Carry me in your arms.

474
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:46,989
On the palace steps

475
00:47:51,077 --> 00:47:54,413
There is such a pretty girl

476
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:58,334
Such a pretty girl

477
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:01,754
She has so many suitors

478
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:08,886
She doesn’t know which to choose

479
00:48:12,181 --> 00:48:15,643
I was dreaming. It was Christmas.

480
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:19,271
There was a big fir tree
with stars and garlands.

481
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:22,191
I gave you a magnificent present,

482
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:25,653
and you gave me the steeple cock.

483
00:48:26,278 --> 00:48:30,533
And you carried me in your
arms around the tree, like now.

484
00:48:31,283 --> 00:48:33,828
I was looking at the world upside down,

485
00:48:33,953 --> 00:48:36,288
like when you’re dead.

486
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:39,583
If you knew how nice this feels!

487
00:48:39,834 --> 00:48:41,961
Like I’m flying.

488
00:48:43,838 --> 00:48:47,633
Don’t stop. Keep going.

489
00:48:48,968 --> 00:48:51,470
We drank sparkling champagne,

490
00:48:51,971 --> 00:48:55,141
and I fell asleep in a
big bed next to my Pierre,

491
00:48:55,266 --> 00:48:57,184
with my hand in yours.

492
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:02,523
On the palace steps

493
00:49:06,152 --> 00:49:09,697
There is such a pretty girl

494
00:49:09,822 --> 00:49:14,285
Such a pretty girl

495
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:30,885
There is such a pretty
girl Such a pretty girl

496
00:49:32,011 --> 00:49:35,848
On the palace steps

497
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:49,236
There is such a pretty
girl Such a pretty girl

498
00:49:59,163 --> 00:50:01,123
Keep singing, Pierre.

499
00:50:19,391 --> 00:50:21,769
Oh, Pierre, you were singing.

500
00:50:21,894 --> 00:50:23,812
You’re happy.

501
00:50:25,564 --> 00:50:27,066
You know...

502
00:50:27,316 --> 00:50:30,402
I’ve heard you singing
several times now.

503
00:50:36,408 --> 00:50:38,536
Why do you push me away?

504
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:42,373
Don’t you want me anymore?

505
00:51:12,778 --> 00:51:14,280
Darling...

506
00:51:16,282 --> 00:51:18,284
understand.

507
00:51:19,368 --> 00:51:22,746
I love you, Pierre.

508
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:25,708
The rest doesn’t matter.

509
00:51:28,294 --> 00:51:30,504
If you want me again...

510
00:51:31,255 --> 00:51:33,590
your slave will be right here.

511
00:51:38,345 --> 00:51:41,140
But right now she has
to make herself pretty.

512
00:51:41,807 --> 00:51:45,894
I haven’t told you
yet: I have a surprise.

513
00:51:49,815 --> 00:51:52,651
You’re going to put on a white shirt,

514
00:51:52,818 --> 00:51:55,195
a tie, and your suit.

515
00:51:55,404 --> 00:51:57,656
And I’m going to put on

516
00:51:57,823 --> 00:52:00,451
my sexy dress, the one that -

517
00:52:02,161 --> 00:52:05,956
We’re invited to lunch
to celebrate a wedding.

518
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:08,125
You remember Bernard?

519
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:11,337
Thanks to him, I got the day off.

520
00:52:11,503 --> 00:52:14,089
We’re having lunch at a restaurant

521
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:17,301
with his friend who got married.

522
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:21,138
They’re coming by to pick us up.

523
00:52:24,433 --> 00:52:26,310
Are you pleased?

524
00:52:30,356 --> 00:52:34,318
I’m so happy to have a whole
Sunday with you at last.

525
00:52:37,029 --> 00:52:39,698
And I want to look very beautiful...

526
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:41,867
for you.

527
00:52:44,370 --> 00:52:46,455
Bernard will be jealous.

528
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:51,168
I told you he flirted with
me when I started there.

529
00:52:51,293 --> 00:52:53,587
In a friendly way, of course.

530
00:52:53,921 --> 00:52:56,173
But if I’d wanted -

531
00:52:56,465 --> 00:53:01,387
Not many ladies there can boast
that they resisted his advances.

532
00:53:03,514 --> 00:53:05,849
But I have my Pierre,

533
00:53:05,974 --> 00:53:07,726
and the rest -

534
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:24,743
Stop. That’s Pierre. Where’s he going?

535
00:53:28,247 --> 00:53:29,915
Hey, Pierre!

536
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:39,258
It’s the guy who lives with Madeleine.

537
00:53:39,425 --> 00:53:43,512
He was shot down in a plane and
found half dead in a remote village.

538
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:45,681
Come on, we’ll take you back.

539
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:49,351
That’s how he ended up
at the country hospital

540
00:53:49,476 --> 00:53:51,478
where Madeleine was a nurse.

541
00:53:57,651 --> 00:53:59,778
Madeleine, what’s going on?

542
00:53:59,945 --> 00:54:02,614
Bernard, Pierre’s gone.

543
00:54:10,289 --> 00:54:12,124
Where were you?

544
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:15,294
You’ll drive me mad.

545
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:17,463
We saw him on the street,

546
00:54:17,588 --> 00:54:19,923
on his way to see your
friend the sculptor.

547
00:54:20,048 --> 00:54:22,801
I wanted to tell Carlos
we’d been invited out.

548
00:54:22,968 --> 00:54:26,013
But why run off like
that without a word?

549
00:54:26,889 --> 00:54:29,183
I was worried sick.

550
00:54:30,225 --> 00:54:32,728
You can’t imagine what I thought.

551
00:54:37,065 --> 00:54:39,568
Madeleine, you think too much.

552
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:41,779
Get dressed now.

553
00:54:41,904 --> 00:54:43,989
I’ll get the others to wait.

554
00:54:46,158 --> 00:54:48,202
We thought you’d be ready.

555
00:55:16,104 --> 00:55:18,607
Darling, are you dreaming?

556
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:23,779
No, I’m just looking.

557
00:55:24,488 --> 00:55:26,490
Don’t you want any more to eat?

558
00:55:27,199 --> 00:55:29,243
Come closer.

559
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:33,038
- What time is it?
- Why? Are you tired?

560
00:55:33,205 --> 00:55:35,999
Frangoise, give me your
glass. Don’t drink it all.

561
00:55:36,208 --> 00:55:38,502
To your love life, Pierre.

562
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:43,215
Corot used to come here to paint.

563
00:55:43,382 --> 00:55:47,219
His poetic charm, the
chiaroscuro of his woodlands -

564
00:55:47,386 --> 00:55:49,221
he got it all here.

565
00:55:49,388 --> 00:55:53,016
You should have been an art
critic, not a pharmacist.

566
00:55:53,141 --> 00:55:55,185
He read all that in a guidebook.

567
00:55:55,394 --> 00:55:58,981
It’s a cultural resource like any other.

568
00:55:59,106 --> 00:56:01,275
Please, what time is it?

569
00:56:02,734 --> 00:56:05,904
You don’t drink champagne like water.

570
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:16,206
Now I’ll tell you the story

571
00:56:16,331 --> 00:56:18,709
of the acupuncturist and the balloon.

572
00:56:18,834 --> 00:56:20,961
Can’t you be quiet for five minutes?

573
00:56:21,086 --> 00:56:24,089
Your loss. You’d burst with laughter.

574
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:31,388
Frangoise, I’m going to tell you one.

575
00:56:31,513 --> 00:56:33,557
It’s a story without words.

576
00:56:33,682 --> 00:56:37,185
I need a big spoon and a little spoon.

577
00:56:38,687 --> 00:56:42,858
You accompany me by rubbing the
edge of a glass with a wet finger.

578
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:45,986
Now, try to understand.

579
00:57:11,845 --> 00:57:14,556
There, Pierre. We’re home.

580
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:18,143
You know the blue stone you gave me?

581
00:57:18,435 --> 00:57:20,312
I still have it.

582
00:57:20,646 --> 00:57:23,398
When they turn the lights
out in the dormitory,

583
00:57:23,523 --> 00:57:26,735
I put it on my pillow and look at it...

584
00:57:27,778 --> 00:57:31,657
as hard as my grandmother
looks in her magic ball,

585
00:57:31,782 --> 00:57:35,494
and I repeat “Pierre... Pierre...”

586
00:57:36,370 --> 00:57:38,455
until you appear.

587
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:40,874
Then I talk to you.

588
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:43,585
One night you kissed me.

589
00:57:43,877 --> 00:57:46,296
You know how that happened?

590
00:57:46,672 --> 00:57:49,508
The little blue stone
rolled down the pillow

591
00:57:49,633 --> 00:57:51,677
and touched my shoulder

592
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:53,804
like two Ups.

593
00:57:54,429 --> 00:57:56,723
If I hadn’t woken up just then...

594
00:57:57,432 --> 00:58:00,686
I’d never have known if
it was for real or not.

595
00:58:03,063 --> 00:58:05,232
You never kiss me.

596
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:08,360
I love you, Pierre.

597
00:58:08,819 --> 00:58:10,529
I love you.

598
00:58:10,904 --> 00:58:13,281
Take me away, Pierre.

599
00:58:17,786 --> 00:58:21,289
Pierre, what’s wrong? What do you want?

600
00:58:30,549 --> 00:58:32,092
What time is it?

601
00:58:32,217 --> 00:58:34,636
Why? You have an appointment?

602
00:58:38,432 --> 00:58:41,727
You should give him a watch.
He has no notion of time.

603
00:58:41,893 --> 00:58:43,687
Or too keen of one.

604
00:58:44,021 --> 00:58:47,399
It’s not late, darling. Four o’clock.

605
00:58:49,401 --> 00:58:51,903
But if you’re tired, we’ll go home.

606
00:58:57,576 --> 00:58:59,661
You never kiss me.

607
00:59:12,674 --> 00:59:14,092
Miss!

608
00:59:17,304 --> 00:59:19,347
The check, please.

609
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:08,313
Pierre, are you coming? We’re leaving.

610
01:00:15,237 --> 01:00:19,115
Look, your face is all wet.

611
01:00:20,575 --> 01:00:23,453
You’ll catch cold and
get a headache again.

612
01:01:00,782 --> 01:01:03,243
What’s he doing? Where’s he going?

613
01:02:05,639 --> 01:02:07,432
I want to go home.

614
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:09,643
- In just a bit.
- No, right now.

615
01:02:09,768 --> 01:02:13,355
They want to visit the fair.
We can’t refuse. It’ll be fun.

616
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:15,482
There’s too much noise.

617
01:02:15,607 --> 01:02:19,236
Do it to please me, or
at least to be polite.

618
01:02:19,361 --> 01:02:22,113
You looked glum all through lunch.

619
01:02:22,238 --> 01:02:24,199
You might try to be nice.

620
01:02:24,324 --> 01:02:27,327
Are the lovebirds having a little nap?

621
01:02:50,684 --> 01:02:53,520
I’m sure there are
intelligent people among you

622
01:02:53,728 --> 01:02:56,606
who are convinced that
fate influences their lives.

623
01:02:56,731 --> 01:03:00,694
Don’t hesitate. I’ll tell it like it is.

624
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:03,488
The truth -that’s what you’ll get.

625
01:03:03,697 --> 01:03:07,242
- Today’s the day to try it.
- No, out of the question!

626
01:03:07,367 --> 01:03:09,452
Things like that frighten me.

627
01:03:10,954 --> 01:03:13,039
You, young man.

628
01:03:13,999 --> 01:03:16,251
In your face I see a great future.

629
01:03:16,626 --> 01:03:18,920
No, it’s the past that interests him.

630
01:03:19,045 --> 01:03:21,506
I read the past just as well.

631
01:03:21,673 --> 01:03:23,758
Go on. You caught her eye.

632
01:03:23,883 --> 01:03:27,095
Sure! The clairvoyant
rescues the amnesiac.

633
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:30,098
Very funny. And intelligent too.

634
01:03:30,348 --> 01:03:32,684
Let’s move on.
- I want to go in.

635
01:03:32,809 --> 01:03:34,853
This is silly. Let’s go home.

636
01:03:34,978 --> 01:03:38,732
Don’t make a scene. We’re
here to have fun, right?

637
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:45,655
No, madame. Each person
has their own truth,

638
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:47,824
and each must wait their turn.

639
01:03:50,535 --> 01:03:54,122
Daylight is no friend
to mystery, young man.

640
01:03:54,372 --> 01:03:56,082
Sit down.

641
01:03:57,709 --> 01:04:00,962
It’s 1,500 for a full
reading. All right?

642
01:04:05,216 --> 01:04:07,302
You’re quite the generous one.

643
01:04:07,427 --> 01:04:09,262
Give me your hands.

644
01:04:14,642 --> 01:04:16,686
You had an accident.

645
01:04:17,103 --> 01:04:18,772
A serious one.

646
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:22,233
Yes, I see it now. Very serious.

647
01:04:24,027 --> 01:04:27,072
Look into my eyes or
I can’t see anything.

648
01:04:27,489 --> 01:04:29,324
That’s better.

649
01:04:29,657 --> 01:04:31,326
Wait.

650
01:04:31,576 --> 01:04:34,079
I see the sun...

651
01:04:34,245 --> 01:04:36,706
trees, the sea.

652
01:04:37,415 --> 01:04:39,250
You’ve traveled.

653
01:04:40,043 --> 01:04:42,462
Clouds. Wait.

654
01:04:43,171 --> 01:04:44,881
You’re fighting.

655
01:04:45,215 --> 01:04:48,259
I see fire... flames.

656
01:04:48,927 --> 01:04:51,137
You know what I’m talking about?

657
01:04:56,518 --> 01:04:58,645
That’s the hair of a Hindu priestess.

658
01:04:58,853 --> 01:05:00,772
Just for decoration.

659
01:05:01,773 --> 01:05:04,109
- And this?
- That?

660
01:05:06,861 --> 01:05:09,239
That’s a sorcerer’s dagger.

661
01:05:10,156 --> 01:05:11,950
It’s from Africa.

662
01:05:12,450 --> 01:05:16,454
You stick it in a tree and
put your ear to the handle,

663
01:05:16,621 --> 01:05:19,499
and you commune with the spirits.

664
01:05:20,125 --> 01:05:23,336
It’s full of fluid,
in case you’re curious.

665
01:05:25,922 --> 01:05:28,133
Should I tell you your love life?

666
01:05:28,466 --> 01:05:30,301
Give me your hand.

667
01:05:31,010 --> 01:05:33,221
No, your left hand.

668
01:05:36,724 --> 01:05:38,476
Oh, my!

669
01:05:38,601 --> 01:05:40,603
You’re loved very much!

670
01:05:40,854 --> 01:05:43,148
Wait. I see...

671
01:05:44,858 --> 01:05:46,359
see...

672
01:05:56,995 --> 01:05:58,997
What did she tell you?

673
01:05:59,247 --> 01:06:02,000
She said I was loved very much.

674
01:06:23,146 --> 01:06:25,690
You have your license?

675
01:06:26,566 --> 01:06:27,692
What?

676
01:06:48,963 --> 01:06:51,925
Serves you right, road hog!

677
01:07:30,213 --> 01:07:31,881
Let me go!

678
01:07:54,404 --> 01:07:56,906
Leave him alone!

679
01:08:13,464 --> 01:08:16,509
Clear the rink or I’ll call the cops!

680
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:44,621
Well, kids...

681
01:08:45,246 --> 01:08:48,458
My money’s on your pal.
He’s a real champion.

682
01:08:52,003 --> 01:08:54,380
This is all your fault.
You made him drink.

683
01:08:54,505 --> 01:08:57,467
That takes the cake! Now it’s my fault.

684
01:08:57,592 --> 01:09:00,178
It’s the last time I get
involved with loonies.

685
01:09:00,845 --> 01:09:02,263
That’s enough now.

686
01:09:02,388 --> 01:09:05,183
We’ll carry him upstairs.
I’ll stay if you like.

687
01:09:05,350 --> 01:09:09,103
Thanks. I can look after him myself.

688
01:09:16,527 --> 01:09:19,447
Darling, forgive me.

689
01:09:19,572 --> 01:09:21,240
It’s my fault.

690
01:09:22,367 --> 01:09:24,285
I’m such an idiot.

691
01:10:17,755 --> 01:10:21,092
Excuse me, sir, but
it’s about Frangoise.

692
01:10:21,884 --> 01:10:22,969
Come in.

693
01:10:23,094 --> 01:10:26,848
That won’t be necessary.
Besides, I’m not alone.

694
01:10:26,973 --> 01:10:29,600
Another sister is waiting
for me at the pharmacy.

695
01:10:29,767 --> 01:10:31,769
I mustn’t be long.

696
01:10:32,103 --> 01:10:33,771
What is it?

697
01:10:33,938 --> 01:10:36,941
It’s not serious. Don’t worry.

698
01:10:37,316 --> 01:10:40,111
Frangoise is ill. Well, not really ill.

699
01:10:40,278 --> 01:10:42,363
She’s a very sensitive child,

700
01:10:42,488 --> 01:10:45,575
and you didn’t come for her on Sunday.

701
01:10:45,700 --> 01:10:49,287
You’d promised to take
her out, hadn’t you?

702
01:10:50,997 --> 01:10:53,040
That’s the cause of the trouble.

703
01:10:53,207 --> 01:10:55,334
She imagines you don’t love her anymore,

704
01:10:55,585 --> 01:10:58,129
that you’re going to abandon her.

705
01:10:58,963 --> 01:11:02,467
She’s such an excitable
child, so extreme.

706
01:11:02,675 --> 01:11:05,386
And since sick children
can have visitors,

707
01:11:05,636 --> 01:11:08,598
I took the liberty of coming to get you.

708
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:12,643
Frangoise, your daddy’s here.

709
01:11:12,769 --> 01:11:14,729
I’ll leave you for a while.

710
01:11:21,110 --> 01:11:25,156
I wanted to come last
Sunday. We were invited out.

711
01:11:25,323 --> 01:11:28,451
It’s not my fault that
I couldn’t let you know.

712
01:11:31,329 --> 01:11:34,332
It didn’t end until past 4:00.

713
01:11:34,582 --> 01:11:36,334
Too late.

714
01:11:39,462 --> 01:11:41,756
You remember the other Sunday?

715
01:11:42,423 --> 01:11:45,092
You had a dream about Christmas.

716
01:11:45,343 --> 01:11:48,721
The tree, the stars, the garlands.

717
01:11:49,555 --> 01:11:51,724
I’m going to do all that.

718
01:12:00,483 --> 01:12:03,361
If you won’t look at me, I’m going.

719
01:12:08,908 --> 01:12:10,618
No, stay!

720
01:12:12,578 --> 01:12:14,789
Pierre, you abandoned me.

721
01:12:16,666 --> 01:12:18,960
Who was she?
- Madeleine.

722
01:12:19,085 --> 01:12:22,338
- So she’s your wife?
- No.

723
01:12:24,048 --> 01:12:27,009
Liar. Why did she kiss you like that?

724
01:12:27,134 --> 01:12:29,011
Some manners!

725
01:12:31,889 --> 01:12:35,434
She deserved a good punch,
but you shouldn’t have.

726
01:12:36,102 --> 01:12:38,229
It was awful.

727
01:12:39,063 --> 01:12:40,940
You frightened me.

728
01:12:41,566 --> 01:12:44,860
I suppose you don’t love me anymore.

729
01:12:45,903 --> 01:12:48,072
Of course I love you.

730
01:12:50,032 --> 01:12:52,618
What a mess, I must say.

731
01:13:04,505 --> 01:13:07,884
What did you say you
wanted to do for Christmas?

732
01:13:09,635 --> 01:13:11,512
Like in your dream.

733
01:13:11,637 --> 01:13:14,765
You’re crazy! What will your wife say?

734
01:13:14,890 --> 01:13:17,101
She won’t know about it.

735
01:13:17,351 --> 01:13:19,437
I’ve been thinking,

736
01:13:19,562 --> 01:13:22,064
and I’ve got it all worked out.

737
01:13:27,111 --> 01:13:29,113
Have you seen Pierre?

738
01:13:31,365 --> 01:13:33,451
He must be at the boarding school.

739
01:13:33,618 --> 01:13:36,579
One of the nuns stopped
by your place on a bike.

740
01:13:36,704 --> 01:13:38,789
Two pounds of oranges, please.

741
01:13:41,292 --> 01:13:43,294
Charles, what should I give her?

742
01:13:43,461 --> 01:13:46,964
- Give her the Maltese.
- I’ll pick some out.

743
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:51,302
And a bit later he practically
ran out of the building.

744
01:13:51,469 --> 01:13:53,763
Perhaps the little girl’s ill.

745
01:13:54,180 --> 01:13:57,141
- Little girl?
- I forgot the biscuits.

746
01:13:57,350 --> 01:14:00,478
Please add them to my bill.

747
01:14:02,688 --> 01:14:06,859
Don’t get so worked up.
It’s probably not serious.

748
01:14:07,485 --> 01:14:08,945
No...

749
01:14:09,946 --> 01:14:12,281
I’m just a bit tired these days.

750
01:14:14,075 --> 01:14:16,160
Yes, he went to see the child.

751
01:14:17,078 --> 01:14:19,497
He should have left me a note.

752
01:14:20,122 --> 01:14:21,791
Thank you.

753
01:14:26,003 --> 01:14:27,546
What did you tell her?

754
01:14:27,838 --> 01:14:31,634
Remember the pretty little girl we
see with him Sundays at the pond?

755
01:14:31,759 --> 01:14:35,471
Yes. But she looked upset.
What’s wrong with her?

756
01:14:54,073 --> 01:14:55,866
It can 7 be.

757
01:14:56,033 --> 01:14:57,702
Oh, Carlos...

758
01:14:58,661 --> 01:15:01,998
he must have met a little
girl from the boarding school.

759
01:15:02,248 --> 01:15:05,376
He’s managed to see her every Sunday.

760
01:15:05,835 --> 01:15:08,295
That’s why he said he was with you...

761
01:15:08,421 --> 01:15:12,174
or that he’d gone to the
station to watch the trains.

762
01:15:12,299 --> 01:15:13,884
He was lying.

763
01:15:15,886 --> 01:15:18,764
The neighbors thought
she was his daughter.

764
01:15:18,889 --> 01:15:20,975
They thought / knew all about it.

765
01:15:21,559 --> 01:15:23,519
But that’s all very sweet.

766
01:15:27,148 --> 01:15:30,192
Something’s not right
if he hid it from me.

767
01:15:30,901 --> 01:15:33,070
He’s scared of me.

768
01:15:34,989 --> 01:15:39,243
My only chance was to gain
his complete confidence...

769
01:15:40,161 --> 01:15:42,830
so we could begin a real life together.

770
01:15:42,955 --> 01:15:44,623
A normal life.

771
01:15:46,083 --> 01:15:48,461
He never spoke to you about all this?

772
01:15:48,586 --> 01:15:51,797
No, but you mustn’t get so worked up.

773
01:15:51,922 --> 01:15:54,842
It’s nothing serious. Pierre loves you.

774
01:15:57,595 --> 01:16:00,097
No, everything’s changed.

775
01:16:01,849 --> 01:16:04,769
And to think I thought
he was doing better.

776
01:16:07,188 --> 01:16:09,940
I even heard him singing once.

777
01:16:11,859 --> 01:16:13,068
Now -

778
01:16:17,656 --> 01:16:19,950
Yesterday we went to the fair.

779
01:16:20,076 --> 01:16:22,995
That morning he’d gone
off without a word.

780
01:16:24,371 --> 01:16:27,291
It was to warn her that
he couldn’t see her.

781
01:16:27,583 --> 01:16:29,627
Yes, of course!

782
01:16:30,252 --> 01:16:32,463
Now I remember clearly.

783
01:16:36,801 --> 01:16:39,637
We were riding the bumper cars.

784
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:45,476
I saw a little girl from the
boarding school watching us.

785
01:16:46,268 --> 01:16:48,813
I would recognize her now.

786
01:16:49,647 --> 01:16:52,441
It was strange, the
way she looked at us.

787
01:16:54,985 --> 01:16:57,863
It was then that
Pierre seemed to go mad.

788
01:16:58,614 --> 01:17:00,908
He struck me like a brute.

789
01:17:02,451 --> 01:17:04,453
It started a brawl.

790
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:08,624
When we got him home, he was delirious.

791
01:17:09,750 --> 01:17:13,671
He kept repeating the same words as
when he arrived at the hospital...

792
01:17:13,838 --> 01:17:15,589
half dead.

793
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:21,512
He kept saying in English, “Is she dead?

794
01:17:22,179 --> 01:17:24,014
Did I kill her?”

795
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:33,107
You mustn’t mix everything up.

796
01:17:33,524 --> 01:17:35,234
He’s in love.

797
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:37,278
It’s that simple.

798
01:17:37,570 --> 01:17:42,116
Someone in love naturally has
secrets. Don’t call them lies -

799
01:17:42,241 --> 01:17:45,661
In love with a child?
You think that’s normal?

800
01:17:46,328 --> 01:17:49,582
- I think it’s marvelous.
- Have you gone mad?

801
01:17:51,041 --> 01:17:54,587
What harm do you think he
can do with a little girl?

802
01:17:54,879 --> 01:17:57,047
He’s no Bluebeard.

803
01:17:58,174 --> 01:18:01,135
Pierre’s like a child himself.

804
01:18:01,635 --> 01:18:05,389
With this little girl he’s
found a world where he fits in,

805
01:18:05,514 --> 01:18:07,391
where he’s happy.

806
01:18:08,058 --> 01:18:10,603
Frankly, I’d like to be in his shoes.

807
01:18:10,728 --> 01:18:12,688
You never understand.

808
01:18:12,813 --> 01:18:15,983
Reality isn’t always
like in your dreams!

809
01:18:17,943 --> 01:18:21,572
- Pierre isn’t a child anymore.
- Don’t listen to Carmela.

810
01:18:21,739 --> 01:18:25,326
She’s a good woman, but she
never thinks with her heart.

811
01:18:25,451 --> 01:18:27,036
Listen to me.

812
01:18:27,161 --> 01:18:30,247
I’m telling you this
for your own good...

813
01:18:30,748 --> 01:18:32,875
and for Pierre’s too.

814
01:18:34,084 --> 01:18:38,005
Tell me: Have you looked in his eyes?

815
01:18:38,130 --> 01:18:41,425
Well, I have, and they’re not normal!

816
01:18:41,550 --> 01:18:43,761
And it’s not because he has amnesia.

817
01:18:43,886 --> 01:18:47,723
He probably doesn’t realize
himself that he could be dangerous.

818
01:18:48,307 --> 01:18:52,478
That’s the full moon for you -when
one woman in three goes crazy.

819
01:18:52,603 --> 01:18:56,523
With Carmela it never fails.
Why not just call him a sadist?

820
01:18:56,732 --> 01:19:00,694
Then why does he hide? If
all this is perfectly normal -

821
01:19:00,819 --> 01:19:02,905
When you were a child,

822
01:19:03,030 --> 01:19:05,449
did you tell your parents everything?

823
01:19:05,699 --> 01:19:09,703
Try to understand instead of
brooding over him like a mother hen.

824
01:19:09,828 --> 01:19:11,664
It’s not the same thing.

825
01:19:11,789 --> 01:19:13,958
In any case, she must warn the nuns.

826
01:19:14,083 --> 01:19:16,293
Sure, and kick up a real fuss!

827
01:19:16,460 --> 01:19:19,255
I’m sure his love for
that child is pure.

828
01:19:19,546 --> 01:19:21,757
He’s reliving his childhood.

829
01:19:22,383 --> 01:19:24,802
Just get him to tell you himself.

830
01:19:24,969 --> 01:19:27,304
- But if I ask
him - - Don’t ask.

831
01:19:27,471 --> 01:19:29,723
There’s no point. He’ll just panic.

832
01:19:29,848 --> 01:19:32,476
You have to win back
his confidence first.

833
01:19:32,643 --> 01:19:36,438
He mustn’t feel that he needs you

834
01:19:36,647 --> 01:19:39,775
but that you need him.

835
01:19:40,276 --> 01:19:42,903
I’m sure he wants to tell you about it.

836
01:19:43,278 --> 01:19:45,739
I’d like to believe you, Carlos...

837
01:19:47,574 --> 01:19:50,202
but I have to get to the bottom of this.

838
01:19:50,911 --> 01:19:52,788
Be very careful.

839
01:19:52,913 --> 01:19:54,957
Respect him, Madeleine.

840
01:19:56,333 --> 01:19:58,669
You mustn’t sully something beautiful.

841
01:20:03,382 --> 01:20:07,219
You know, I struck you on Sunday.

842
01:20:07,386 --> 01:20:09,680
I didn’t mean to.

843
01:20:09,847 --> 01:20:12,141
I don’t know what happened.

844
01:20:13,058 --> 01:20:16,562
Perhaps it was all the noise.

845
01:20:17,646 --> 01:20:21,191
There was so much noise and -

846
01:20:24,528 --> 01:20:26,363
It was the noise.

847
01:20:27,448 --> 01:20:29,283
Yes, of course.

848
01:20:30,075 --> 01:20:32,703
We were foolish to take you there.

849
01:20:35,247 --> 01:20:38,709
Christmas is next Monday,
and I have a day off coming.

850
01:20:38,834 --> 01:20:42,713
I can take Sunday or Tuesday.
Which would you prefer?

851
01:20:42,838 --> 01:20:44,798
Tuesday would be best.

852
01:20:44,923 --> 01:20:48,093
I haven’t been to Paris in a long time.

853
01:20:48,218 --> 01:20:50,554
All right. Go on now.

854
01:20:51,388 --> 01:20:53,057
Go on.

855
01:20:53,223 --> 01:20:55,517
Don’t keep Carlos waiting.

856
01:22:16,890 --> 01:22:19,143
There. We’re home now.

857
01:23:37,221 --> 01:23:38,889
Listen.

858
01:25:05,642 --> 01:25:07,978
What can I bring you?

859
01:25:11,815 --> 01:25:13,775
Two warm grenadines.

860
01:25:13,900 --> 01:25:16,236
Two warm grenadines?

861
01:25:18,780 --> 01:25:20,407
Yes.

862
01:25:20,532 --> 01:25:23,493
I mean, no. Two hot toddies.

863
01:25:23,618 --> 01:25:26,371
A hot toddy. Two.

864
01:25:26,580 --> 01:25:28,749
Two hot toddies, please.

865
01:25:36,173 --> 01:25:38,508
Is this like where you went for lunch?

866
01:25:38,633 --> 01:25:40,594
It wasn’t as nice,

867
01:25:40,719 --> 01:25:42,721
but you could see the pond.

868
01:25:43,805 --> 01:25:46,850
You didn’t tell your wife about us?

869
01:25:47,893 --> 01:25:50,812
Good. Are your hands still cold?

870
01:25:51,021 --> 01:25:53,190
Mine are frozen.

871
01:26:02,658 --> 01:26:05,619
Will you tell me your real name someday?

872
01:26:12,626 --> 01:26:16,755
And you? Will you give me
the steeple cock someday?

873
01:26:23,261 --> 01:26:25,639
You think this is a real cafe?

874
01:26:26,056 --> 01:26:27,474
Why?

875
01:26:28,892 --> 01:26:30,727
There’s no one here.

876
01:26:31,228 --> 01:26:33,397
Maybe it’s very expensive.

877
01:26:33,605 --> 01:26:35,732
Do you have enough money?

878
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:38,068
I think so.

879
01:27:18,233 --> 01:27:22,362
You know, if you ever
stopped coming for me...

880
01:27:22,946 --> 01:27:25,282
I think I’d want to die.

881
01:27:25,615 --> 01:27:28,076
- Die?
- Yes.

882
01:27:31,496 --> 01:27:33,331
To close my eyes.

883
01:27:35,876 --> 01:27:38,003
Turn quite cold.

884
01:27:40,046 --> 01:27:42,466
They’d put me in a coffin...

885
01:27:43,300 --> 01:27:45,469
and nail down the lid.

886
01:27:47,804 --> 01:27:50,223
There’d be no name on my grave...

887
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:54,436
because no one would know my real name.

888
01:27:55,812 --> 01:27:58,774
Even if they wrote “Frangoise,”

889
01:27:59,316 --> 01:28:01,485
it wouldn’t mean anything.

890
01:28:03,904 --> 01:28:07,532
I wouldn’t exist anymore.

891
01:28:08,783 --> 01:28:10,952
I’ll always come for you.

892
01:28:12,954 --> 01:28:15,665
And if I died, would you die too?

893
01:28:17,667 --> 01:28:20,962
Or go back to your wife
and forget about me?

894
01:28:23,465 --> 01:28:25,425
You’d forget me, huh?

895
01:28:25,634 --> 01:28:27,135
Tell me.

896
01:28:29,554 --> 01:28:31,348
You’d die too?

897
01:28:32,057 --> 01:28:33,517
Yes.

898
01:28:47,656 --> 01:28:49,491
Tomorrow’s Monday.

899
01:28:49,908 --> 01:28:52,661
But I don’t care,
because it’s Christmas...

900
01:28:53,411 --> 01:28:56,164
and you made me a promise.

901
01:31:13,635 --> 01:31:16,388
No, Bertrand! You’ll blind the people!

902
01:31:16,513 --> 01:31:18,890
Higher!

903
01:31:19,516 --> 01:31:21,685
The Lord didn’t favor you, son.

904
01:31:21,851 --> 01:31:25,105
You think people want to
see that scaffolding tonight?

905
01:31:25,230 --> 01:31:28,191
The steeple cock!

906
01:31:40,537 --> 01:31:42,038
Papa!

907
01:31:46,918 --> 01:31:49,629
It’s the man who hit me!

908
01:32:05,395 --> 01:32:07,439
How do you know it was him?

909
01:32:07,689 --> 01:32:10,108
Who else would do such a thing?

910
01:32:11,276 --> 01:32:14,779
And he nearly poked a
neighbor’s eye out with the tree.

911
01:32:14,904 --> 01:32:16,948
I feel bad for my little nephews.

912
01:32:17,073 --> 01:32:21,077
And look at the door. No
need to smash it in like that.

913
01:32:21,411 --> 01:32:23,038
I’m afraid.

914
01:32:25,957 --> 01:32:29,711
You said you saw them
together and understood.

915
01:32:34,716 --> 01:32:36,551
What’s the matter?

916
01:32:37,427 --> 01:32:39,429
Where are you off to?

917
01:32:39,721 --> 01:32:41,765
Where are you going?

918
01:32:41,931 --> 01:32:44,184
I don’t know. To look for them.

919
01:32:44,309 --> 01:32:47,729
I’ll see to my nephews
and call you later.

920
01:32:58,114 --> 01:33:01,075
- May I make a call?
- A Paris number?

921
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:08,875
You don’t have a booth?

922
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:12,128
No one here has any secrets.

923
01:33:15,131 --> 01:33:18,468
My dear children, Christmas is
the loveliest day of the year...

924
01:33:18,593 --> 01:33:20,470
What will you have?

925
01:33:20,637 --> 01:33:22,555
...a celebration for the young...

926
01:33:22,680 --> 01:33:24,349
A white wine.

927
01:33:26,559 --> 01:33:28,144
Dry or sweet?

928
01:33:30,105 --> 01:33:31,523
Dry.

929
01:33:33,233 --> 01:33:35,318
Hello, Bernard?

930
01:33:35,902 --> 01:33:38,696
I don’t know what to do.
Pierre hasn’t come home.

931
01:33:38,822 --> 01:33:40,824
He must be with the little girl.

932
01:33:41,449 --> 01:33:44,661
He took a big Christmas
tree from Carlos’s place.

933
01:33:45,870 --> 01:33:47,455
What’s that?

934
01:33:49,165 --> 01:33:51,000
I don’t know.

935
01:33:51,751 --> 01:33:54,170
He must have gone to get her.

936
01:33:55,964 --> 01:33:59,092
Did I call where? The school?

937
01:33:59,676 --> 01:34:03,012
No. Suppose he’s not
with her. Suppose she’s -

938
01:34:04,806 --> 01:34:07,892
Please come. I’ll wait for you.

939
01:34:08,017 --> 01:34:09,477
Hurry.

940
01:34:14,190 --> 01:34:16,067
Rue de Sevres.

941
01:34:16,526 --> 01:34:19,279
Hold on. What’s the address here?

942
01:34:19,404 --> 01:34:21,322
Twenty-two.

943
01:34:22,198 --> 01:34:23,741
Twenty-two.

944
01:34:24,033 --> 01:34:25,869
How long will you be?

945
01:34:26,369 --> 01:34:28,454
Please hurry. I’ll be waiting.

946
01:34:28,580 --> 01:34:32,041
Bernard, we have to find him,

947
01:34:32,208 --> 01:34:34,252
or I’ll go mad myself!

948
01:34:34,502 --> 01:34:39,007
... electric trains, and
dolls with eyes that dose.

949
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:46,055
My dear children, Christmas is also...

950
01:34:46,222 --> 01:34:50,351
- What do I owe you?
- With the call, 95 francs.

951
01:34:50,476 --> 01:34:53,980
...to be good little girls and boys...

952
01:34:54,105 --> 01:34:56,774
You haven’t see a man
with a Christmas tree?

953
01:34:56,900 --> 01:34:59,402
Oh, we’ve seen quite a few today.

954
01:34:59,527 --> 01:35:02,655
A big tree... all decorated.

955
01:35:03,740 --> 01:35:05,825
What’s this man look like?

956
01:35:06,159 --> 01:35:08,536
He’s tall and blond,

957
01:35:08,661 --> 01:35:12,457
with very short hair
and light blue eyes.

958
01:35:12,582 --> 01:35:15,501
You don’t mean the Satyr, do you?

959
01:35:16,294 --> 01:35:19,255
- What?
- It’s a joke.

960
01:35:19,380 --> 01:35:22,008
My wife and I call him that

961
01:35:22,425 --> 01:35:25,303
because we see him
every Sunday by the pond,

962
01:35:25,428 --> 01:35:27,555
where we go to fish.

963
01:35:27,680 --> 01:35:31,976
He’s always with a little girl.
You’d think they were lovers.

964
01:35:32,268 --> 01:35:36,439
She must be his daughter,
but since he looks a bit odd,

965
01:35:36,606 --> 01:35:39,400
we nicknamed him the Satyr.

966
01:35:39,525 --> 01:35:43,112
My dear little friends,
even when you’ve grown up,

967
01:35:43,279 --> 01:35:47,408
never miss your rendezvous
with Father Christmas!

968
01:36:09,806 --> 01:36:12,475
Where’d you get all those big candles?

969
01:36:12,642 --> 01:36:14,018
At church.

970
01:36:14,143 --> 01:36:16,771
- They gave them to you?
- Yes.

971
01:36:17,230 --> 01:36:20,191
You’re such a poor liar!

972
01:36:20,733 --> 01:36:23,444
I hope no one saw you take them.

973
01:36:24,487 --> 01:36:26,155
Come look.

974
01:36:38,042 --> 01:36:39,544
Look.

975
01:36:44,465 --> 01:36:48,344
You know, this will be
my first real Christmas.

976
01:36:49,554 --> 01:36:53,516
I’ve always been sent to bed
at 9:00, like any other evening.

977
01:36:58,646 --> 01:37:00,940
Did you cut yourself?

978
01:37:01,065 --> 01:37:04,068
- It broke.
- That’s all right. One will do.

979
01:37:04,193 --> 01:37:06,154
Let me see your finger.

980
01:37:07,447 --> 01:37:11,451
Poor Pierre. Best to let it bleed a bit.

981
01:37:17,206 --> 01:37:18,875
There... all better.

982
01:37:19,083 --> 01:37:22,712
I know all your thoughts now
that I’ve drunk your blood.

983
01:37:24,380 --> 01:37:28,176
Will you open the champagne?
I’ll leave you for a minute.

984
01:37:28,384 --> 01:37:30,428
Don’t turn around.

985
01:38:02,502 --> 01:38:05,505
You know, we should make a wish.

986
01:38:07,048 --> 01:38:10,760
I’d like to stay with
you forever and ever.

987
01:38:11,302 --> 01:38:13,805
We’d go on vacation to the seaside.

988
01:38:14,097 --> 01:38:16,265
I’ve never been to the sea.

989
01:38:16,432 --> 01:38:18,643
We’d see fish that fly.

990
01:38:18,851 --> 01:38:21,145
You laugh, but they really do exist.

991
01:38:21,437 --> 01:38:23,689
There are fish with wings.

992
01:38:23,981 --> 01:38:26,275
I read that in a book.

993
01:38:26,776 --> 01:38:29,237
They must be beautiful.

994
01:38:32,365 --> 01:38:35,868
Let’s drink to make
that happen. Your turn.

995
01:38:47,672 --> 01:38:49,674
I’ve had enough.

996
01:38:50,550 --> 01:38:53,052
Don’t forget I’m a little girl.

997
01:38:53,386 --> 01:38:57,849
Besides, it’s the bubbles I really like.

998
01:38:57,974 --> 01:38:59,976
Well, I’m thirsty.

999
01:39:00,977 --> 01:39:02,854
Pierre, look.

1000
01:39:26,627 --> 01:39:28,421
Unfold it.

1001
01:39:38,014 --> 01:39:40,183
“Cybele.”

1002
01:39:48,482 --> 01:39:50,109
You like it?

1003
01:39:56,115 --> 01:39:59,035
It’s your name, your real name.

1004
01:40:00,244 --> 01:40:01,996
It’s beautiful.

1005
01:40:02,288 --> 01:40:05,166
It sounds like si belle
- so lovely.

1006
01:40:05,541 --> 01:40:07,210
It’s my name.

1007
01:40:07,668 --> 01:40:09,170
It’s me.

1008
01:40:09,462 --> 01:40:12,089
It was the name of a goddess.

1009
01:40:12,381 --> 01:40:16,093
The goddess of trees
and earth, so I was told.

1010
01:40:16,886 --> 01:40:19,472
It’s an ancient name, you know.

1011
01:40:20,556 --> 01:40:22,183
What’s the matter?

1012
01:40:22,308 --> 01:40:23,726
Nothing...

1013
01:40:24,227 --> 01:40:25,937
but later on...

1014
01:40:26,312 --> 01:40:29,148
I’ll have a surprise for you too.

1015
01:40:50,419 --> 01:40:54,298
- I thought you’d never get here.
- Have you seen the traffic?

1016
01:40:57,093 --> 01:41:01,472
And I stopped by the police
station. I gave them your number.

1017
01:41:01,597 --> 01:41:04,141
- What?
- I phoned the school first.

1018
01:41:04,267 --> 01:41:07,311
He’d already gotten the
girl, so I told the cops.

1019
01:41:07,436 --> 01:41:10,982
I shouldn’t have called
you. You don’t understand.

1020
01:41:11,357 --> 01:41:14,735
I saw them last Sunday. They
were like two happy children.

1021
01:41:14,860 --> 01:41:18,239
Now the cops think he’s a criminal.
- We can’t take risks.

1022
01:41:18,364 --> 01:41:21,534
What risks! You think he’s
going to kill or rape her?

1023
01:41:21,659 --> 01:41:23,786
He’s sick. You must expect the worst.

1024
01:41:23,911 --> 01:41:26,205
You’re the sick one,
you and Carlos’s wife -

1025
01:41:26,330 --> 01:41:28,624
all of you who call yourselves normal.

1026
01:41:28,791 --> 01:41:33,462
You reject anyone who finds happiness
outside your conventions. Why?

1027
01:41:33,796 --> 01:41:36,465
Does his honesty make you uncomfortable?

1028
01:41:36,632 --> 01:41:38,759
Even I began to doubt him.

1029
01:41:39,218 --> 01:41:41,262
Let’s not get sentimental.

1030
01:41:41,387 --> 01:41:43,556
Pierre’s in a violent phase.

1031
01:41:43,681 --> 01:41:46,475
If he subconsciously believes
he killed a little girl once -

1032
01:41:46,601 --> 01:41:48,185
You told me so.

1033
01:41:48,311 --> 01:41:51,814
If he believes he escaped
punishment, he might kill again

1034
01:41:51,981 --> 01:41:55,484
to be punished and be
freed of his obsession.

1035
01:41:55,860 --> 01:41:57,361
One must -

1036
01:41:57,486 --> 01:41:58,779
“One must!”

1037
01:41:58,904 --> 01:42:01,490
You have a lot of common
sense, but no intuition.

1038
01:42:01,657 --> 01:42:05,578
We must keep the police out of
this. He’d never get over it.

1039
01:42:05,703 --> 01:42:09,332
Call them. Tell them it was a joke -

1040
01:42:09,457 --> 01:42:12,126
It’s too late. The nuns
have filed a complaint.

1041
01:43:09,809 --> 01:43:11,519
The vertigo...

1042
01:43:11,769 --> 01:43:13,729
It’s gone!

1043
01:44:08,617 --> 01:44:10,995
- Hello, Pierre?
- No. Who’s this?

1044
01:44:11,120 --> 01:44:12,705
Carlos.

1045
01:44:13,456 --> 01:44:15,332
Is Madeleine there?

1046
01:44:18,794 --> 01:44:20,629
What’s going on?

1047
01:44:22,006 --> 01:44:24,383
That was Bernard who answered.

1048
01:44:25,176 --> 01:44:26,927
We’re waiting.

1049
01:44:27,928 --> 01:44:30,097
Bernard went to the police.

1050
01:44:30,222 --> 01:44:32,475
The police! Are you crazy?

1051
01:44:32,683 --> 01:44:34,894
You realize what you’ve done?

1052
01:44:42,485 --> 01:44:46,322
Listen to me, for your own sake.
This is no time for sentiment.

1053
01:44:47,156 --> 01:44:50,409
The line mustn’t be busy when they call.

1054
01:45:11,931 --> 01:45:14,058
Madeleine? We were cut off.

1055
01:45:14,433 --> 01:45:17,311
I hit the phone with my elbow.

1056
01:45:17,436 --> 01:45:21,816
I don’t know what can be
done now, but I’m on my way.

1057
01:46:18,789 --> 01:46:20,416
Yes, it’s me.

1058
01:46:21,250 --> 01:46:23,168
You found them?

1059
01:46:23,919 --> 01:46:25,170
What?

1060
01:46:25,296 --> 01:46:27,131
You killed him?

1061
01:47:22,478 --> 01:47:24,647
It’s a real miracle.

1062
01:47:24,772 --> 01:47:27,483
Two seconds more and
we’d have been too late.

1063
01:47:27,608 --> 01:47:30,027
He was approaching the sleeping girl

1064
01:47:30,152 --> 01:47:32,154
with a dagger in his hand.

1065
01:48:26,500 --> 01:48:28,502
What are you called?

1066
01:48:31,255 --> 01:48:33,215
What’s your name?

1067
01:48:44,560 --> 01:48:46,562
I have no name now.

1068
01:48:47,396 --> 01:48:49,064
I have no name.

1069
01:48:49,231 --> 01:48:51,191
I’m nobody now!

1070
01:48:51,442 --> 01:48:53,068
I’m nothing!
