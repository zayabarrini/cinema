1
00:01:21,709 --> 00:01:22,903
It's me.

2
00:01:24,579 --> 00:01:26,342
Everything all right?

3
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:32,211
What do you mean they're gone?
You mean, she's gone, too?

4
00:01:35,023 --> 00:01:37,651
I'll be waiting in front of the hotel.

5
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:45,442
Who could have guessed
a thing like that, sir?

6
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:49,019
When he got down into the street,
it was still dark.

7
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:52,020
Then the front door opened again,
and she came out, too.

8
00:03:52,126 --> 00:03:55,254
I thought she must have
come down to say goodbye to him.

9
00:03:55,363 --> 00:03:57,263
Instead, she opens the door of the car,

10
00:03:57,365 --> 00:04:00,732
makes the dog get in, gets in herself,
and they're off.

11
00:04:00,835 --> 00:04:02,735
Aren't you listening, <i>Dottore?</i>

12
00:04:02,837 --> 00:04:04,532
Yes. Yes.

13
00:04:05,573 --> 00:04:07,939
Damn it. This is something
we didn't want. Anyway,

14
00:04:08,042 --> 00:04:11,808
as far as I'm concerned,
I followed the instructions.

15
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,178
You've made up your mind?

16
00:04:21,289 --> 00:04:23,553
What do you think marriage
will get you?

17
00:04:23,658 --> 00:04:26,991
I don't know.
The impression of normalcy.

18
00:04:28,229 --> 00:04:31,892
- Normalcy.
- Yes. Stability, security.

19
00:04:31,999 --> 00:04:36,060
In the morning when I'm dressing
in the mirror I see myself.

20
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:39,230
And compared to everyone else,
I feel I'm different.

21
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,672
What do you see in Giulia?

22
00:04:41,776 --> 00:04:43,835
It may be her body, her sensuality.

23
00:04:43,945 --> 00:04:45,071
Yes? And she?

24
00:04:45,179 --> 00:04:48,046
The minute we're alone
she wants to fool around.

25
00:04:48,149 --> 00:04:51,243
- And then?
- It usually ends up rolling on the rug.

26
00:04:51,352 --> 00:04:54,378
- And the maid with the big tits?
- Oh, she's part of the dowry.

27
00:04:54,489 --> 00:04:58,016
So you're getting married,
and I'm losing my best friend.

28
00:05:00,027 --> 00:05:01,392
That's okay.

29
00:05:20,515 --> 00:05:22,983
Two minutes and you're on, <i>signore.</i>

30
00:05:23,484 --> 00:05:24,849
You're sure he's arriving?

31
00:05:24,952 --> 00:05:27,853
The Colonel? Of course. He'll be here.

32
00:05:27,955 --> 00:05:30,389
He promised. He's very interested.

33
00:05:31,526 --> 00:05:34,495
It's best if you're quiet.
It's funny though, you know?

34
00:05:34,595 --> 00:05:36,460
Everyone would like
to be different from the others,

35
00:05:36,564 --> 00:05:39,965
but instead you want to be
the same as everyone else.

36
00:05:40,201 --> 00:05:42,795
Ten years ago,
my father was in Munich.

37
00:05:44,372 --> 00:05:47,239
Often, after the theater, he told me that

38
00:05:48,276 --> 00:05:50,801
he'd go with friends to a <i>Bierstube.</i>

39
00:05:52,113 --> 00:05:54,877
There was a nutty man
they thought a fool.

40
00:05:55,349 --> 00:05:57,283
He spoke about politics.

41
00:05:58,553 --> 00:06:00,612
He was quite an attraction.

42
00:06:02,623 --> 00:06:05,217
They'd buy him beer
and encourage him.

43
00:06:06,127 --> 00:06:09,392
He'd stand up on the table
making furious speeches.

44
00:06:12,133 --> 00:06:13,532
It was Hitler.

45
00:06:14,802 --> 00:06:17,703
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>that was "Who's Happier Than l"</i>

46
00:06:17,805 --> 00:06:19,932
<i>by Cesare Andrea Bixio.</i>

47
00:06:21,008 --> 00:06:23,033
<i>We conclude our program</i>
<i>of popular music</i>

48
00:06:23,144 --> 00:06:25,203
<i>with Arcangeli and Orchestra.</i>

49
00:06:25,313 --> 00:06:29,044
<i>The singers were Silvana Fioresi,</i>
<i>Oscar Carboni,</i>

50
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:32,210
<i>Lina Termini and "The Swallows."</i>

51
00:06:44,265 --> 00:06:46,256
<i>We bring you now</i>
<i>"Mystique of an Alliance,"</i>

52
00:06:46,367 --> 00:06:48,358
<i>a talk by Italo Montanari.</i>

53
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:53,729
<i>Italy and Germany,</i>
<i>two strongholds of light</i>

54
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:55,869
<i>in the course of centuries.</i>

55
00:06:55,977 --> 00:06:59,606
Their unparalleled encounters
mark a turning point

56
00:07:01,816 --> 00:07:03,249
in the course of world history.

57
00:07:03,351 --> 00:07:06,616
Once again,
these two peoples are rediscovering

58
00:07:06,721 --> 00:07:08,416
their ancient virtues.

59
00:07:08,522 --> 00:07:12,390
Virtues that embody
similarity and reciprocity

60
00:07:12,493 --> 00:07:13,960
that have been long forgotten,

61
00:07:14,061 --> 00:07:17,087
that which Goebbels calls
"the Prussian aspect"

62
00:07:17,198 --> 00:07:18,392
of Benito Mussolini,

63
00:07:18,499 --> 00:07:21,900
and which we call
"the Latin aspect" of Adolf Hitler.

64
00:07:22,003 --> 00:07:26,099
Italy and Germany, bringing the world
two great revolutions,

65
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:29,335
the Anti-Parliamentarian
and the Anti-Democratic.

66
00:07:32,146 --> 00:07:35,377
Please, stay seated, Clerici.

67
00:07:37,018 --> 00:07:38,918
Is there any news for me?

68
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:42,547
Your personal record is really excellent.

69
00:07:43,391 --> 00:07:44,722
Then I'm hired?

70
00:07:44,825 --> 00:07:47,259
Such decisions must be taken slowly.

71
00:07:47,361 --> 00:07:50,421
- Yes, I understand.
- Yes, of course you would.

72
00:07:50,531 --> 00:07:54,262
Civil servant, Baccalaureate in Classics,
good future career,

73
00:07:54,368 --> 00:07:57,132
and Comrade Montanari
has recommended you.

74
00:07:57,838 --> 00:08:00,432
One morning you come to the ministry.

75
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:04,307
You arrive at my office at the ministry
with your bright and shining face,

76
00:08:04,412 --> 00:08:06,107
you make a specific proposal.

77
00:08:10,451 --> 00:08:12,544
The office of the Minister!

78
00:08:15,156 --> 00:08:20,059
<i>Did you ever ask yourself</i>
<i>why people want to collaborate with us?</i>

79
00:08:20,795 --> 00:08:22,695
Some do it out of fear,

80
00:08:23,698 --> 00:08:25,893
most of them for the money.

81
00:08:26,901 --> 00:08:29,301
For faith in Fascism, very few.

82
00:08:29,403 --> 00:08:30,893
But you, no.

83
00:08:31,005 --> 00:08:34,566
I feel that you're not governed
by any of these reasons.

84
00:08:35,242 --> 00:08:37,005
And when may I expect a reply?

85
00:08:38,312 --> 00:08:39,370
I hope very soon.

86
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:43,473
If I put aside the idealist revolutionary...

87
00:08:44,251 --> 00:08:46,742
I must ask myself what your aim is.

88
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:52,959
I stand prepared to go,
as soon as you decide.

89
00:08:54,462 --> 00:08:55,520
Fine.

90
00:09:01,235 --> 00:09:03,726
I'll introduce you to the Minister.

91
00:09:50,451 --> 00:09:52,385
Clerici! Clerici!

92
00:09:54,855 --> 00:09:58,450
- At your service.
- The Minister is expecting us.

93
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:01,027
Is this the first time
you're seeing the Minister?

94
00:10:01,128 --> 00:10:02,322
Yes.

95
00:10:02,429 --> 00:10:05,887
When I explained your plan to him,
the first thing he said was, " Superb.

96
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,231
"Get to Professor Quadri
and you inspire his faith in you.

97
00:10:09,336 --> 00:10:12,169
"You try to discover
who his contacts in Italy are."

98
00:10:12,273 --> 00:10:13,740
Yes, yes, superb!

99
00:10:13,841 --> 00:10:15,672
And even more important, spontaneous!

100
00:10:15,776 --> 00:10:18,836
- And also, voluntary.
- Voluntary agency.

101
00:10:18,946 --> 00:10:21,039
For repressing Anti-Fascism.

102
00:10:22,183 --> 00:10:24,344
<i>You've got to try</i>
<i>and understand women.</i>

103
00:10:26,153 --> 00:10:29,281
Say she had decided to stay in Paris.
She could have, no?

104
00:10:32,593 --> 00:10:35,027
<i>"Animula vagula blandula</i>

105
00:10:35,129 --> 00:10:37,393
<i>"hospes comesque corporis."</i>

106
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,961
I'm sorry, I didn't get that.

107
00:10:42,069 --> 00:10:44,094
It's nothing. It's Latin.

108
00:10:44,672 --> 00:10:47,140
<i>Five seconds, four seconds,</i>

109
00:10:47,241 --> 00:10:50,768
<i>three seconds, two seconds,</i>
<i>one second.</i>

110
00:10:52,112 --> 00:10:55,604
<i>The correct time</i>
<i>at the signal was 1:00 p.m.</i>

111
00:11:09,196 --> 00:11:10,288
Here.

112
00:11:11,065 --> 00:11:11,899
Pretty.

113
00:11:11,899 --> 00:11:12,263
Pretty.

114
00:11:15,469 --> 00:11:17,869
Aren't you giving them to me?

115
00:11:17,972 --> 00:11:20,805
Today I absolutely need your flowers.

116
00:11:20,908 --> 00:11:23,934
Give them here. For you.

117
00:11:28,148 --> 00:11:31,015
You know what I was thinking?
I really must go to a fortune teller.

118
00:11:31,118 --> 00:11:33,609
I want to know everything about you.

119
00:11:38,325 --> 00:11:40,384
Don't stand around looking.

120
00:11:48,335 --> 00:11:49,859
Darling!

121
00:12:08,155 --> 00:12:09,349
Careful!

122
00:12:10,391 --> 00:12:13,360
But, Marcello, we're engaged,
what's wrong with it?

123
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:16,122
My uncle brought something
from America.

124
00:12:18,165 --> 00:12:19,530
What is it?

125
00:12:46,827 --> 00:12:48,419
Mama made out a list of invitations.

126
00:12:48,529 --> 00:12:50,895
- Want to see it?
- No, I trust her.

127
00:12:51,598 --> 00:12:53,691
I was talking to Don Lattanzi.

128
00:12:53,801 --> 00:12:55,826
If you want to marry,
you go to communion,

129
00:12:55,936 --> 00:12:57,699
you've got to confess.

130
00:12:57,805 --> 00:13:00,433
Otherwise he says he cannot marry us.

131
00:13:01,475 --> 00:13:03,033
I don't believe in it.

132
00:13:03,644 --> 00:13:04,668
Who does?

133
00:13:04,778 --> 00:13:08,646
Ninety percent of the people
who go to church today don't believe.

134
00:13:08,749 --> 00:13:10,740
The priests don't either.

135
00:13:10,851 --> 00:13:13,911
All right, if you want me to,
I'll even confess.

136
00:13:15,089 --> 00:13:17,114
I love you.

137
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:21,257
If you want to...

138
00:13:24,398 --> 00:13:27,094
- lf I want to...
- Yes, right here.

139
00:13:28,135 --> 00:13:31,901
On the floor, on the carpet. Want to?

140
00:13:34,808 --> 00:13:37,003
Better think about the priest.

141
00:13:38,812 --> 00:13:40,905
He may not grant absolution.

142
00:13:41,215 --> 00:13:43,479
They grant everyone absolution.

143
00:13:45,219 --> 00:13:48,780
After all, it will be so soon,
our honeymoon.

144
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:54,386
Have you decided yet, where?

145
00:13:55,095 --> 00:13:56,119
Yes.

146
00:13:59,033 --> 00:14:01,467
But I can't tell you anything yet.

147
00:14:04,938 --> 00:14:06,462
It's a surprise.

148
00:14:06,573 --> 00:14:09,167
- A surprise?
- A surprise?

149
00:14:09,443 --> 00:14:12,742
Yes, yes, I adore surprises.

150
00:14:15,616 --> 00:14:17,481
Giulia, leave us alone.

151
00:14:21,221 --> 00:14:24,452
- Marcello, I went down for the mail...
- Come and eat!

152
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:34,733
The letter's anonymous?

153
00:14:35,769 --> 00:14:37,259
What is it all about?

154
00:14:37,371 --> 00:14:40,169
But you know
they're just awful to do this.

155
00:14:40,274 --> 00:14:42,037
Worse than stabbing us in the back.

156
00:14:42,142 --> 00:14:43,473
But what's in the letter?

157
00:14:43,577 --> 00:14:46,273
And the stamp shows
it's someone in Rome.

158
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:49,838
Let me see, Mama.
I want to see what's written there.

159
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:52,748
Read it just for us. But then I'll burn it.

160
00:14:53,454 --> 00:14:55,854
There are such ugly things in it.

161
00:14:56,924 --> 00:15:00,052
<i>"Signora,</i> in permitting your daughter
and her fiancé to marry,

162
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,889
"you're committing more than an error,

163
00:15:01,995 --> 00:15:04,327
"you're committing a crime."

164
00:15:08,335 --> 00:15:10,166
<i>"Signor</i> Clerici's father

165
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:14,434
"has been confined in a mental home,
with a brain disease

166
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:15,803
"brought on by syphilis.

167
00:15:15,909 --> 00:15:17,570
"As you know, this disease is hereditary.

168
00:15:17,678 --> 00:15:21,546
"There's still time to stop this marriage.
A friend."

169
00:15:22,616 --> 00:15:24,243
I'd be happy to undergo a check-up.

170
00:15:24,351 --> 00:15:27,115
- Ridiculous.
- No. I don't mind a bit.

171
00:15:27,221 --> 00:15:30,384
In Germany, premarital medical tests
are obligatory, a friend told me.

172
00:15:30,491 --> 00:15:34,427
My boy, I know. You're not just a man,

173
00:15:34,661 --> 00:15:36,652
you're an angel!

174
00:15:36,964 --> 00:15:38,363
Thank you.

175
00:15:39,233 --> 00:15:41,758
You see, the origin of my father's
mental illness isn't venereal.

176
00:15:41,869 --> 00:15:43,268
That can be medically confirmed.

177
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:45,429
By the way,
my little girl has had the mumps,

178
00:15:45,539 --> 00:15:47,769
scarlet fever, and German measles.

179
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:50,810
- They're all very moral maladies.
- Yes!

180
00:16:37,224 --> 00:16:39,192
Look here, who are you?
Why are you following me?

181
00:16:39,293 --> 00:16:40,954
Pure coincidence.

182
00:16:42,229 --> 00:16:44,094
I wasn't following you.

183
00:16:44,831 --> 00:16:47,823
Evidently, we're both going
to the same place.

184
00:16:54,274 --> 00:16:57,573
I'd like to ask you something.
Would your name be Clerici?

185
00:16:57,678 --> 00:16:59,908
Yes, I'm <i>Dottore</i> Clerici.
And who are you?

186
00:17:00,013 --> 00:17:03,676
I'm Special Agent Manganiello.
Sent by the Colonel.

187
00:17:03,784 --> 00:17:05,012
Get in.

188
00:17:05,786 --> 00:17:07,481
- Thanks.
- Hemlock!

189
00:17:09,289 --> 00:17:13,316
Such disorder.
The place looks like a dung heap.

190
00:17:14,428 --> 00:17:16,020
Yes, it's a pity.

191
00:17:17,497 --> 00:17:18,691
Hemlock!

192
00:17:29,376 --> 00:17:31,970
Speed up, Manganiello,
or we won't catch up with them.

193
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:35,537
I can't go faster than this, sir.
The road is slippery.

194
00:17:37,784 --> 00:17:39,081
Not more than half an hour ahead.

195
00:17:39,186 --> 00:17:41,177
Don't talk so much. Hurry!

196
00:17:45,826 --> 00:17:47,020
It's slippery.

197
00:17:47,127 --> 00:17:50,290
I know. But we must save her,
no matter how slippery.

198
00:17:50,397 --> 00:17:51,557
I understand you.

199
00:17:51,665 --> 00:17:56,898
But if we break our necks,
where will that get us? <i>Dottore?</i>

200
00:17:57,504 --> 00:18:00,803
The Colonel told me
that I have to tell you...

201
00:18:00,907 --> 00:18:02,841
After. Wait here.

202
00:18:05,479 --> 00:18:07,743
Mother. Please cover yourself.

203
00:18:07,948 --> 00:18:10,041
I don't want to see you half nude.

204
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:14,211
What a son I have.
A moralist, my son is now.

205
00:18:16,123 --> 00:18:18,353
You know? I had a dream just now.

206
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:21,484
You came in here by that door,
you sat where you are.

207
00:18:21,595 --> 00:18:23,460
You kissed me actually.

208
00:18:29,336 --> 00:18:31,099
Why aren't you dressed?

209
00:18:31,204 --> 00:18:32,398
What's the time?

210
00:18:32,506 --> 00:18:34,940
It's late. We're gonna visit Papa.

211
00:18:41,548 --> 00:18:43,243
Why doesn't he die?

212
00:18:45,152 --> 00:18:49,054
All that hospital money we'd save,
and I've got so little.

213
00:18:49,156 --> 00:18:52,592
- We'll sell the auto.
- No. I'm not going to sell that.

214
00:18:53,293 --> 00:18:56,091
If I do, it means discharging Hemlock

215
00:18:56,463 --> 00:18:58,727
and I must have him near me.

216
00:18:58,832 --> 00:19:01,164
I get so Ionely in this house.

217
00:19:01,268 --> 00:19:03,566
I want to see him when I please.

218
00:19:05,238 --> 00:19:07,502
Please don't talk to me
about your lovers.

219
00:19:07,607 --> 00:19:10,474
What do you mean? There's only one.

220
00:19:11,211 --> 00:19:14,271
And he's much more elegant
than your silly fiancée is.

221
00:19:19,386 --> 00:19:21,354
What a bastard you are!

222
00:19:21,621 --> 00:19:26,388
No, I'm not selling the car.

223
00:19:27,127 --> 00:19:28,526
I will sell the house.

224
00:19:28,628 --> 00:19:30,596
I want to travel around Europe.

225
00:19:30,697 --> 00:19:32,858
After all, I was born to travel.

226
00:19:32,966 --> 00:19:34,831
And Rome has become so provincial.

227
00:19:34,935 --> 00:19:37,426
Middle-class children marrying
into all kinds of good families.

228
00:19:37,537 --> 00:19:39,835
It's all a lot of horse manure!

229
00:19:46,546 --> 00:19:49,743
- Special Agent Manganiello!
- Present!

230
00:19:51,284 --> 00:19:54,845
Does this house look normal to you?
A place for normal people?

231
00:19:54,955 --> 00:19:56,980
The Colonel told me
that I have to tell you...

232
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:58,990
For a normal childhood?

233
00:19:59,092 --> 00:20:01,560
The decadence here
makes me nauseous.

234
00:20:01,661 --> 00:20:03,094
- Manganiello.
- Yes, <i>Dottore?</i>

235
00:20:03,196 --> 00:20:04,663
Comrade.

236
00:20:05,699 --> 00:20:07,291
Do you see this?

237
00:20:08,502 --> 00:20:09,992
It's morphine.

238
00:20:11,938 --> 00:20:13,997
What did the Colonel say?

239
00:20:14,107 --> 00:20:16,371
There's a small change in the program.

240
00:20:16,476 --> 00:20:19,377
On your way to Paris
before you cross the frontier,

241
00:20:19,479 --> 00:20:23,472
you must stop at Ventimiglia,
Via dei Glicini, number three.

242
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:25,778
Number three Via dei Glicini.

243
00:20:27,087 --> 00:20:29,851
You'll meet a trusted person
called Raoul.

244
00:20:30,123 --> 00:20:32,455
He'll give you further instructions.

245
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:35,084
How long have you been in the ranks?

246
00:20:36,129 --> 00:20:38,222
I began in 1923.

247
00:20:38,331 --> 00:20:40,458
Turkey, France, Greece.

248
00:20:40,567 --> 00:20:42,762
- Always into the breach?
- I'm on the move.

249
00:20:42,869 --> 00:20:44,393
All for family and my country.

250
00:20:44,504 --> 00:20:46,734
Your country before the family.

251
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,104
Yes, sir. Of course.

252
00:20:49,209 --> 00:20:50,676
Comrade!

253
00:20:57,818 --> 00:21:01,618
Manganiello, you see that individual?

254
00:21:02,889 --> 00:21:04,447
His name is Ki.

255
00:21:05,158 --> 00:21:06,887
- Ki?
- That's right.

256
00:21:07,093 --> 00:21:09,357
"Ki" means Hemlock in Japanese.

257
00:21:11,765 --> 00:21:14,165
Being called Hemlock isn't normal.

258
00:21:14,434 --> 00:21:15,992
He's a procurer.

259
00:21:17,938 --> 00:21:21,669
He couldn't be my brother,
but my mother could be his mother.

260
00:21:22,075 --> 00:21:24,134
I said it doesn't seem normal.

261
00:21:25,846 --> 00:21:29,077
He brings her morphine
and uses her as he likes.

262
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:30,906
- Hemlock?
- Yes.

263
00:21:33,019 --> 00:21:35,817
You must understand why I tell you this.

264
00:21:38,825 --> 00:21:43,159
Five minutes and he won't have
the time to take a valise.

265
00:21:55,909 --> 00:21:58,207
Tell the Colonel to count on me!

266
00:22:00,313 --> 00:22:03,749
Hemlock! Hemlock!

267
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:06,546
- Hemlock!
- Where is he hiding?

268
00:22:07,287 --> 00:22:08,584
You weren't rude to him again,
were you?

269
00:22:08,688 --> 00:22:10,622
I? No, he's so charming.

270
00:22:13,493 --> 00:22:14,687
Hemlock!

271
00:22:16,763 --> 00:22:18,094
Hemlock!

272
00:22:27,474 --> 00:22:29,271
Have you looked in his room?

273
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:32,311
I've looked everywhere.
Even under your bed.

274
00:22:57,671 --> 00:22:59,969
- How are things, Franz?
- Better than yesterday.

275
00:23:00,073 --> 00:23:02,371
- Yesterday, we were bad.
- Pretty bad?

276
00:23:02,475 --> 00:23:04,306
Yesterday we were forced
to wear our straitjacket.

277
00:23:04,411 --> 00:23:05,742
- And today?
- Today is better.

278
00:23:05,845 --> 00:23:07,972
The wind seems to help our inspiration.

279
00:23:08,081 --> 00:23:10,413
I'll never be tired of repeating.

280
00:23:10,517 --> 00:23:12,212
If the State doesn't model itself

281
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:15,413
on the image of the individual,
how will the individual

282
00:23:15,522 --> 00:23:18,650
ever model himself
in the image of the state?

283
00:23:18,758 --> 00:23:20,783
Et cetera, et cetera.

284
00:23:21,628 --> 00:23:24,461
Slaughter and melancholy.

285
00:23:25,198 --> 00:23:27,428
Slaughter and melancholy.

286
00:23:27,534 --> 00:23:30,332
Antonio, your son's
decided to get married.

287
00:23:32,606 --> 00:23:34,631
Marcello getting married?

288
00:23:39,346 --> 00:23:42,645
Slaughter and melancholy.

289
00:23:43,817 --> 00:23:44,875
Look.

290
00:23:46,653 --> 00:23:48,120
The announcement of the wedding.

291
00:23:48,221 --> 00:23:50,712
Stop it. He's your father!

292
00:23:53,727 --> 00:23:55,695
I like it. Sign it.

293
00:24:05,705 --> 00:24:08,196
Read. He's not as crazy as he looks.

294
00:24:11,311 --> 00:24:14,007
May I ask a moment alone
with my father?

295
00:24:14,681 --> 00:24:16,308
When I was just a boy,

296
00:24:16,449 --> 00:24:18,383
you used to tell me
about your punitive forays.

297
00:24:18,485 --> 00:24:20,453
I don't know, I can't recall anything.

298
00:24:20,553 --> 00:24:23,613
But why are you ashamed?
It's important for me.

299
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:28,818
When you were healthy,
you used a big cudgel.

300
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:29,986
Yes.

301
00:24:30,096 --> 00:24:32,894
- And did you give castor oil to them?
- Yes.

302
00:24:33,233 --> 00:24:34,928
- And didn't you torture them?
- Yes.

303
00:24:35,035 --> 00:24:37,503
Didn't you kill? You killed, too?

304
00:24:37,604 --> 00:24:40,266
Go away! Franz! Franz!

305
00:24:57,157 --> 00:24:59,682
Do you believe at all in fate, <i>Dottore?</i>

306
00:25:00,293 --> 00:25:04,559
Well, two years ago in Africa,
after a mission like this,

307
00:25:04,664 --> 00:25:08,691
they tell me at Headquarters,
"Did you receive the counter-orders?"

308
00:25:08,802 --> 00:25:10,895
"Hey, what counter-orders?"

309
00:25:11,404 --> 00:25:13,304
Well, in Rome, they decided
to suspend the whole thing

310
00:25:13,406 --> 00:25:15,567
because it wasn't necessary.

311
00:25:16,409 --> 00:25:18,001
Let's hurry!

312
00:25:20,013 --> 00:25:22,208
There's nothing we can do
for the woman

313
00:25:22,315 --> 00:25:24,249
even if we get there in time.

314
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:27,547
You know perfectly well
we can't afford any witnesses.

315
00:25:27,887 --> 00:25:29,115
Then stop!

316
00:25:30,223 --> 00:25:31,417
I'll get out!

317
00:25:37,297 --> 00:25:39,629
What's the use of going? You go!

318
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,032
<i>Dottore</i> Marcello!

319
00:25:51,377 --> 00:25:54,175
But we have to be there.
We have a certain responsibility.

320
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,145
Would you look at that!

321
00:25:57,250 --> 00:25:58,683
Stop!

322
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:06,358
Who makes the report otherwise?

323
00:26:06,659 --> 00:26:08,217
Unbutton his pants!

324
00:26:11,131 --> 00:26:13,497
Let me up! Let me up!

325
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,262
The police! The police! Come on!

326
00:26:52,172 --> 00:26:53,230
Stop!

327
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:06,918
- <i>What's your name?</i>
- <i>Marcello Clerici. What's yours?</i>

328
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:09,614
<i>Pasqualino Semirama. But call me Lino.</i>

329
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:23,198
How long is it since
your last confession?

330
00:27:23,303 --> 00:27:24,600
Since I made my first Holy Communion.

331
00:27:24,704 --> 00:27:26,604
Bad, my son, very bad.

332
00:27:27,173 --> 00:27:29,437
- How old are you?
- Thirty-four.

333
00:27:29,742 --> 00:27:33,041
And all this time
you have lived like an animal.

334
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:37,240
Tell me, which sins
have you committed?

335
00:27:38,484 --> 00:27:40,714
I've committed them all.
Even the worst sin.

336
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:44,586
- AII?
- AII. Even murder.

337
00:27:45,191 --> 00:27:49,821
Murder? And you didn't
feel the need to confess?

338
00:27:50,496 --> 00:27:51,520
Pardon?

339
00:27:51,631 --> 00:27:55,123
You didn't feel the need
to rush to confession?

340
00:27:58,071 --> 00:27:59,333
I was 13.

341
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:32,570
Well, what were your friends
trying to do?

342
00:28:32,672 --> 00:28:33,969
They're just stupid.

343
00:28:34,073 --> 00:28:35,870
What did they want from you?

344
00:28:56,095 --> 00:28:58,256
All right, then, what present?

345
00:28:58,798 --> 00:28:59,822
A gun.

346
00:28:59,933 --> 00:29:02,299
- A cap pistol?
- No, a real one.

347
00:29:02,902 --> 00:29:05,871
I have one, too. A Mauser.

348
00:29:06,439 --> 00:29:09,602
You want it?
If you want it, I'll give it to you.

349
00:29:09,809 --> 00:29:12,972
- Where is it?
- It's in my room. Come.

350
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:17,481
I have a pretty oriental kimono, too.

351
00:29:17,951 --> 00:29:21,648
- Do you know who Madame Butterfly is?
- Where are you going?

352
00:30:23,783 --> 00:30:27,014
Go on, tell me.
What did he want from you?

353
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,112
I didn't know what.
He was so much like a woman.

354
00:30:30,223 --> 00:30:32,691
- A woman?
- He trembled like a woman.

355
00:30:33,393 --> 00:30:35,953
<i>Well, what happened? Kisses?</i>

356
00:30:36,796 --> 00:30:38,229
<i>Touching you?</i>

357
00:30:39,665 --> 00:30:42,429
Are you sure you're telling me the truth?

358
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:45,364
Yes.

359
00:30:46,139 --> 00:30:50,405
And what happened there between you?
Carnal relations?

360
00:30:53,212 --> 00:30:56,306
Shoot. What are you waiting for?
Go on, shoot.

361
00:30:56,416 --> 00:30:58,111
Kill the pretty butterfly!

362
00:31:36,522 --> 00:31:40,219
- Now you must tell me the details.
- No, that's enough, please.

363
00:31:40,326 --> 00:31:42,692
It's almost as though you think sodomy

364
00:31:42,795 --> 00:31:45,059
is a more mortal sin
than killing somebody, <i>padre.</i>

365
00:31:45,164 --> 00:31:47,257
I won't permit such insolence.

366
00:31:47,366 --> 00:31:49,266
You are forgetting
that I happen to be the priest,

367
00:31:49,368 --> 00:31:51,063
and you the sinner.

368
00:31:52,105 --> 00:31:56,303
After that once, did you have
sexual relations with other men?

369
00:31:56,776 --> 00:31:59,540
No. All the rest were normal.

370
00:31:59,645 --> 00:32:01,237
Which means what?

371
00:32:01,347 --> 00:32:03,315
A brothel when I was 18.

372
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:07,078
Since then,
relationships only with women.

373
00:32:07,186 --> 00:32:10,644
This in your opinion
is a sexual life that's normal?

374
00:32:10,756 --> 00:32:12,451
Yes. But why?

375
00:32:12,892 --> 00:32:15,656
But you, my son,
have always lived in sin.

376
00:32:16,929 --> 00:32:21,832
Normal means matrimony,
having a wife, family.

377
00:32:22,568 --> 00:32:24,160
That's what I find.

378
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:27,137
Bravo, bravo, bravo.

379
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,936
I'm going to build a life that's normal.

380
00:32:30,343 --> 00:32:32,675
I'm marrying a petty bourgeois.

381
00:32:33,312 --> 00:32:36,076
Then she must be a fine girl.

382
00:32:39,152 --> 00:32:41,052
Speak out. Go ahead!

383
00:32:46,025 --> 00:32:47,253
Mediocre.

384
00:32:48,528 --> 00:32:50,428
A mound of petty ideas.

385
00:32:52,031 --> 00:32:54,295
Full of petty ambitions.

386
00:32:55,268 --> 00:32:57,133
She's all bed and kitchen.

387
00:32:57,236 --> 00:32:59,602
You have no right
to use such expressions.

388
00:32:59,705 --> 00:33:01,002
Normality.

389
00:33:02,108 --> 00:33:05,635
I intend to construct my normality,
but it won't be easy.

390
00:33:05,745 --> 00:33:08,543
- Stay within religion...
- Outside religion!

391
00:33:09,182 --> 00:33:12,447
God is so bountiful.
The Virgin is so maternal.

392
00:33:13,052 --> 00:33:15,350
Christ is so merciful to us all.

393
00:33:15,888 --> 00:33:19,585
And the priest is so blessed
with understanding.

394
00:33:22,728 --> 00:33:25,492
You haven't demonstrated
any horror at my crime yet.

395
00:33:25,598 --> 00:33:27,759
It didn't make you pause.

396
00:33:27,867 --> 00:33:31,769
You're surprised because I didn't run
to confession right away.

397
00:33:31,971 --> 00:33:34,303
The one thing you have to do
is repent humbly,

398
00:33:34,407 --> 00:33:35,635
ask His pardon today.

399
00:33:35,741 --> 00:33:40,041
I've already repented.
I want to be excused by society.

400
00:33:40,746 --> 00:33:41,770
Yes.

401
00:33:42,982 --> 00:33:46,349
I want to confess today
the sin I'll commit tomorrow.

402
00:33:46,519 --> 00:33:48,578
One sin atones for another.

403
00:33:49,021 --> 00:33:52,548
It is the price I must pay society.
And I shall pay it.

404
00:33:52,925 --> 00:33:54,859
Are you a part of some new sect?

405
00:33:54,961 --> 00:33:57,623
Do you belong
to a group of subversives?

406
00:33:58,097 --> 00:34:00,361
No. No.

407
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:05,630
I belong to a group that
tracks down all the subversives.

408
00:34:06,672 --> 00:34:09,072
<i>Ego te absolvo</i>

409
00:34:09,408 --> 00:34:11,205
<i>a peccatis tuis.</i>

410
00:34:12,211 --> 00:34:13,337
Music!

411
00:34:40,673 --> 00:34:41,867
Long live the bridegroom!

412
00:34:41,974 --> 00:34:43,771
Long live the bridegroom!

413
00:34:43,876 --> 00:34:45,173
Congratulations!

414
00:34:45,278 --> 00:34:47,576
- When is the wedding?
- Next Sunday.

415
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,477
The bride, why didn't you bring her?

416
00:34:49,582 --> 00:34:50,810
What's her name?

417
00:34:50,916 --> 00:34:55,148
Let's drink to the end of bachelorhood!

418
00:34:56,122 --> 00:34:59,353
- We have biscuits, too.
- Crackers as well.

419
00:35:03,629 --> 00:35:06,257
Only a drop. Pour me just a drop.

420
00:35:06,365 --> 00:35:08,424
It goes to my head quickly.

421
00:35:20,413 --> 00:35:24,907
- The party makes me nervous.
- People wanted to meet you.

422
00:35:29,021 --> 00:35:32,923
- Never mind. It's just a tray.
- Good, good. It's a lucky sign.

423
00:35:37,229 --> 00:35:39,629
You know, they're so excited.

424
00:35:40,733 --> 00:35:45,500
Whenever there's an event,
people get excited.

425
00:35:45,771 --> 00:35:47,705
Forgive them.

426
00:35:47,807 --> 00:35:51,299
- I'm going on a mission.
- Good!

427
00:35:55,214 --> 00:35:58,308
Your performance was wonderful.

428
00:35:58,417 --> 00:36:01,511
- I appreciate it.
- I am never refused.

429
00:36:04,290 --> 00:36:08,522
Music. Come on, let's play.

430
00:36:16,068 --> 00:36:20,129
People are waiting
to speak with the <i>Duce.</i>

431
00:36:20,339 --> 00:36:23,797
Suddenly a frightful scream is heard.

432
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:35,710
That's enough.

433
00:36:37,323 --> 00:36:42,226
Where are you? Started again?

434
00:36:43,295 --> 00:36:47,231
Last time's lesson wasn't enough
for you? Stop crying.

435
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:51,129
I shall play for you
the last part of "Foxtrot" by Maestro Lori.

436
00:36:58,711 --> 00:37:02,147
What do you get
out of working for the man?

437
00:37:04,417 --> 00:37:07,409
I get the feeling I'm finally back

438
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,216
to the normal state I mentioned to you.

439
00:37:11,991 --> 00:37:16,758
- How do you think a normal man...
- A normal man!

440
00:37:19,865 --> 00:37:22,095
For me, a normal man is one

441
00:37:23,536 --> 00:37:27,802
who turns his head to see
a beautiful woman's bottom.

442
00:37:28,941 --> 00:37:31,671
The point is not just to turn your head.

443
00:37:31,777 --> 00:37:33,745
There are 5-6 reasons,

444
00:37:34,747 --> 00:37:40,185
and he is glad to find people
who are like him, his equals.

445
00:37:40,653 --> 00:37:43,554
That's why he likes crowded beaches,

446
00:37:43,656 --> 00:37:45,681
football, the bar downtown...

447
00:37:45,791 --> 00:37:47,918
At Piazza Venezia.

448
00:37:49,462 --> 00:37:52,124
He likes people similar to himself

449
00:37:52,231 --> 00:37:55,394
and does not trust
those who are different.

450
00:37:56,669 --> 00:38:00,002
That's why a normal man is
a true brother, a true citizen,

451
00:38:00,105 --> 00:38:02,573
- a true patriot.
- A true Fascist.

452
00:38:08,347 --> 00:38:11,612
You haven't ever wondered
how come we're friends?

453
00:38:12,751 --> 00:38:16,312
Since we're different from the others.

454
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:19,624
We are two of a kind.

455
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:25,096
Are you here?

456
00:38:28,634 --> 00:38:33,094
What's the matter, you don't agree?
I know you do.

457
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:35,406
I am never wrong.

458
00:38:37,243 --> 00:38:40,735
It rains from the scattered clouds

459
00:38:40,846 --> 00:38:43,781
It rains on the parched
tamarisks about you

460
00:38:44,116 --> 00:38:46,448
The happy pines glistening dew

461
00:38:47,653 --> 00:38:50,178
And upon the myrtles it rains anew

462
00:38:50,756 --> 00:38:52,849
It rains upon our naked hands

463
00:38:52,958 --> 00:38:54,892
On our transparent vestments

464
00:38:54,994 --> 00:38:57,986
On the new thoughts our souls reveal

465
00:39:00,299 --> 00:39:03,393
And on the fable
that eluded me yesterday

466
00:39:04,436 --> 00:39:06,700
And eludes me today, Hermione

467
00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:27,923
Marcello, I am unworthy of you.

468
00:39:29,161 --> 00:39:31,789
Marcello, I am unworthy of you.

469
00:39:33,132 --> 00:39:35,794
Yes, yes. I don't deserve you.

470
00:39:36,368 --> 00:39:38,768
You sound the same as your mother.

471
00:39:44,143 --> 00:39:46,839
I have something to tell you,
but you mustn't look at me,

472
00:39:46,946 --> 00:39:50,074
so please look out there.
If you look, I'll be ashamed.

473
00:39:53,652 --> 00:39:55,847
Maybe afterwards
you won't love me anymore,

474
00:39:55,955 --> 00:39:58,321
but I've got to tell you.

475
00:39:58,891 --> 00:40:02,918
You know,
what you think of me isn't true.

476
00:40:03,896 --> 00:40:07,423
You think I'm a virgin. I'm not.

477
00:40:10,169 --> 00:40:12,694
What do you think of me now?

478
00:40:12,972 --> 00:40:16,135
I didn't marry you because
I thought you're still a virgin.

479
00:40:16,241 --> 00:40:18,573
Dearest, I know
your mentality's modern,

480
00:40:18,677 --> 00:40:21,271
but then I felt I should tell you the truth.

481
00:40:21,947 --> 00:40:23,676
I forgot to mention it.

482
00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:27,544
At Ventimiglia, we'll get off.
I've got an appointment.

483
00:40:28,587 --> 00:40:31,715
But I have to tell you
the whole thing. I have to.

484
00:40:37,363 --> 00:40:38,796
You're angry.

485
00:40:39,765 --> 00:40:43,462
You were in love with someone
before you met me. Who was it?

486
00:40:44,203 --> 00:40:47,366
He was a man of 60.
A very disgusting old man.

487
00:40:49,575 --> 00:40:51,543
A friend of my family's.

488
00:40:52,645 --> 00:40:56,376
- Who is it?
- It's the Advocate Perpuzio.

489
00:40:56,482 --> 00:40:57,744
Perpuzio?

490
00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:03,020
- But he's one of our witnesses.
- He insisted on it.

491
00:41:03,122 --> 00:41:05,317
But how was I going to say no?

492
00:41:10,763 --> 00:41:13,323
- Six years it went on.
- Six years?

493
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,197
Six years.

494
00:41:20,472 --> 00:41:21,496
All right.

495
00:41:21,607 --> 00:41:24,201
<i>Pardon, monsieur.</i>
We'll be in Ventimiglia in a few minutes.

496
00:41:24,309 --> 00:41:25,537
Thank you.

497
00:41:35,688 --> 00:41:38,851
- This is number three Via dei Glicini?
- Number three.

498
00:42:02,414 --> 00:42:04,006
Who is it?

499
00:42:04,116 --> 00:42:07,142
He looked to me like he might be
an officer in civvies!

500
00:42:20,866 --> 00:42:23,892
This isn't a museum.
Go inside, go inside!

501
00:42:26,004 --> 00:42:28,564
I'll send the others down right away.

502
00:42:29,775 --> 00:42:32,300
I'm an idiot, a complete maniac.

503
00:42:36,248 --> 00:42:38,182
Again! Say it again.

504
00:42:38,684 --> 00:42:41,084
The gentleman is a friend
of <i>Signor</i> Raoul's.

505
00:42:41,186 --> 00:42:43,552
Go on! Say it!

506
00:42:44,490 --> 00:42:47,516
I'm crazy, a complete maniac.

507
00:42:55,134 --> 00:42:56,431
I'm crazy.

508
00:43:05,377 --> 00:43:06,639
Clerici!

509
00:43:07,479 --> 00:43:09,743
What are you doing wasting time?

510
00:43:09,848 --> 00:43:11,145
Come here!

511
00:43:17,222 --> 00:43:18,246
What?

512
00:43:18,357 --> 00:43:21,383
Professor Quadri's activities in France

513
00:43:21,493 --> 00:43:23,825
have become interfering
and provocative.

514
00:43:23,929 --> 00:43:27,023
It's become necessary
to make an example of him.

515
00:43:28,333 --> 00:43:31,496
You had to contact and inspire
him with confidence

516
00:43:31,603 --> 00:43:33,161
and get information.

517
00:43:33,272 --> 00:43:35,797
- But now...
- But now?

518
00:43:37,109 --> 00:43:41,011
There's a counter-order from Rome.
All you do is eliminate him.

519
00:43:43,615 --> 00:43:45,276
- That clear?
- Very.

520
00:43:46,585 --> 00:43:49,281
The operation will not
take place in Paris.

521
00:43:49,388 --> 00:43:52,619
It's up to you to choose
the locale and the moment.

522
00:43:54,726 --> 00:43:56,216
It's up to you.

523
00:44:02,734 --> 00:44:05,225
There's nothing more to talk about.

524
00:44:05,637 --> 00:44:09,073
Fine. This means I have no alternative.

525
00:44:10,609 --> 00:44:12,201
Comrade Clerici!

526
00:44:12,778 --> 00:44:15,645
It must be quick and decisive! Comrade!

527
00:44:21,954 --> 00:44:24,752
The train for Paris leaves in an hour.

528
00:44:26,525 --> 00:44:30,188
I lost my hat. Where's my hat?
Where is it?

529
00:44:36,335 --> 00:44:38,701
Then he entered the room. Slowly.

530
00:44:39,204 --> 00:44:41,866
Finally he stood behind me
and said, "Is that French?"

531
00:44:41,974 --> 00:44:43,669
Come and sit here.

532
00:44:47,312 --> 00:44:49,610
"It's my Latin lesson," I said.

533
00:44:50,482 --> 00:44:52,450
He grabbed me by my hair.

534
00:44:55,821 --> 00:44:58,688
And then, imagine,
I used to call him Uncle.

535
00:45:00,893 --> 00:45:03,054
He unbuttoned my blouse then.

536
00:45:13,906 --> 00:45:16,397
I was well-developed at 15, I guess.

537
00:45:18,377 --> 00:45:22,404
He began to squeeze my breasts
harder until I almost fainted.

538
00:45:29,988 --> 00:45:34,254
And then, I don't know.
I was suddenly on the bed.

539
00:45:37,696 --> 00:45:39,425
He was on top of me.

540
00:45:39,598 --> 00:45:39,765
Then I understood everything
and all my strength left me.

541
00:45:39,765 --> 00:45:43,599
Then I understood everything
and all my strength left me.

542
00:45:53,045 --> 00:45:54,603
Did you like it?

543
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:57,607
- I lay there passive.
- And then?

544
00:45:57,716 --> 00:46:00,116
He did everything to me he wanted.

545
00:46:10,095 --> 00:46:13,531
I cried so much,
and in order to console me,

546
00:46:13,632 --> 00:46:17,033
he said he was absolutely,
absolutely crazy about me.

547
00:46:18,437 --> 00:46:19,904
Six years.

548
00:46:55,273 --> 00:46:57,833
I would like 26, 15, 37.

549
00:46:57,943 --> 00:47:01,845
- Length nine and width...
- I'll wait.

550
00:47:02,381 --> 00:47:05,509
Who are you telephoning to?
One, two, three, four...

551
00:47:05,617 --> 00:47:08,484
- A man with a hump.
- Hunchbacks bring good luck!

552
00:47:08,587 --> 00:47:10,145
Five and six.

553
00:47:11,356 --> 00:47:15,315
Six by nine ought to amount
to 54 meters square, isn't it?

554
00:47:15,427 --> 00:47:16,917
That's right.

555
00:47:17,162 --> 00:47:19,858
He was our professor at the university.

556
00:47:21,833 --> 00:47:23,824
They named him Smerdikoff.

557
00:47:24,569 --> 00:47:27,436
But his was the only class
that was crowded.

558
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:31,041
All the freshman girls
were in love with him.

559
00:47:33,078 --> 00:47:34,409
Still busy?

560
00:47:36,348 --> 00:47:39,511
Please, in a few minutes
will you ring it for me?

561
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:46,113
The year I was supposed to graduate,
they gave him the castor oil.

562
00:47:46,725 --> 00:47:49,193
He won't remember after nine years.

563
00:47:49,861 --> 00:47:52,489
I had to go and ask him for my thesis.

564
00:47:54,633 --> 00:47:56,692
He asked me if I was a Fascist.

565
00:47:56,802 --> 00:47:58,463
And what did you answer?

566
00:47:59,137 --> 00:48:01,367
I didn't bother to answer him.

567
00:48:02,941 --> 00:48:04,966
He told me it would be
impossible for him

568
00:48:05,077 --> 00:48:07,910
to teach philosophy in a Fascist country.

569
00:48:08,647 --> 00:48:09,773
Hello.

570
00:48:11,483 --> 00:48:14,008
This is Clerici.
I was a student of yours back in Rome,

571
00:48:14,119 --> 00:48:16,314
and I'd like to see you again.

572
00:48:18,790 --> 00:48:22,191
Of course, Professor.
I came about my graduate thesis.

573
00:48:22,661 --> 00:48:25,357
It was the year that
you stopped teaching.

574
00:48:25,464 --> 00:48:27,193
<i>I don't remember your name.</i>

575
00:48:27,299 --> 00:48:29,961
<i>It was so long ago. Clerici, you said?</i>

576
00:48:30,068 --> 00:48:34,368
Yes. And you said to me...
I remember that day so well, everything,

577
00:48:35,107 --> 00:48:37,871
you said,
"The time for reflection is over for me.

578
00:48:37,976 --> 00:48:39,807
"Now begins the time for action."

579
00:48:39,911 --> 00:48:43,142
- <i>And you want to see me?</i>
- Yes.

580
00:48:43,381 --> 00:48:44,405
<i>Why?</i>

581
00:48:45,383 --> 00:48:47,681
I don't have any precise reason.

582
00:48:48,253 --> 00:48:50,346
They still speak about you in Rome.

583
00:48:50,455 --> 00:48:52,946
And I'd like to see you, that's all.

584
00:48:53,959 --> 00:48:56,985
<i>Let's see.</i>
<i>Could you come over to my house?</i>

585
00:48:57,095 --> 00:48:59,063
Yes. When?

586
00:48:59,364 --> 00:49:02,891
<i>Today if you like, after lunch.</i>
<i>Come and have a coffee.</i>

587
00:49:03,001 --> 00:49:05,970
I'm honeymooning in Paris.

588
00:49:06,271 --> 00:49:08,239
Would it be all right
if I brought my wife?

589
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:10,365
<i>Of course.</i>
<i>Seventeen Rue Saint Jacques.</i>

590
00:49:10,475 --> 00:49:12,966
- <i>I'll see you later then.</i>
- Thank you.

591
00:49:14,846 --> 00:49:17,747
He has a nice voice.
Not like a hunchback's.

592
00:49:19,184 --> 00:49:22,847
What shall I wear?
Street clothes or really get dressed up?

593
00:49:25,090 --> 00:49:26,580
But why bother?

594
00:49:27,526 --> 00:49:30,518
He'll be a typical intellectual,
disagreeable and impotent.

595
00:49:30,629 --> 00:49:31,960
How do you know that?

596
00:49:32,063 --> 00:49:35,191
I don't really.
My uncle used to always say...

597
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:37,632
- Uncle Perpuzio!
- Laugh, laugh.

598
00:49:38,503 --> 00:49:41,563
Only he's the one
who sent the anonymous letter.

599
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:50,113
Cut that out!

600
00:49:51,049 --> 00:49:52,539
But, Marcello...

601
00:49:59,925 --> 00:50:02,086
Answer that. Say I'm not in.

602
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:06,262
- But what if it's a foreigner?
- No, he'll be an Italian.

603
00:50:06,932 --> 00:50:08,524
Answer the phone!

604
00:50:12,504 --> 00:50:13,937
Hello?

605
00:50:14,206 --> 00:50:15,639
No, he's not in.

606
00:50:16,174 --> 00:50:18,199
Very well, I'll tell him.

607
00:50:18,310 --> 00:50:20,972
He said he'd call back this afternoon.

608
00:50:21,513 --> 00:50:23,481
Funny name, Manganiello.

609
00:51:25,944 --> 00:51:28,606
- Yes, what is it?
- I'm <i>Monsieur</i> Clerici.

610
00:51:28,713 --> 00:51:32,877
- You've got the wrong apartment.
- I've an appointment.

611
00:51:32,984 --> 00:51:34,178
You're Italian?

612
00:51:34,286 --> 00:51:37,346
The professor is expecting them.
I'll take care.

613
00:51:45,563 --> 00:51:46,996
Get away, Marcello!

614
00:51:50,669 --> 00:51:54,298
He'll bite you! Run!

615
00:52:00,912 --> 00:52:02,311
Down, Roby!

616
00:52:03,014 --> 00:52:05,005
Get down! Sit down!

617
00:52:14,492 --> 00:52:16,983
You're <i>Monsieur</i> Clerici, aren't you?

618
00:52:17,562 --> 00:52:18,790
Come in.

619
00:52:23,101 --> 00:52:26,593
- Nothing to be afraid of.
- Me? I'm not a bit frightened.

620
00:52:26,705 --> 00:52:29,936
Well then come up.
He won't bite now, I tell you.

621
00:52:30,308 --> 00:52:32,640
Funny, usually dogs like me.

622
00:52:36,815 --> 00:52:38,976
Is this the first time
you're visiting Paris?

623
00:52:39,084 --> 00:52:41,814
- Do you like it?
- Yes. It's so pretty.

624
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:45,117
The station, the hotel, and now here.

625
00:52:47,859 --> 00:52:49,588
- Please.
- Thank you.

626
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:56,896
If you like,
later I could show you a bit of the town.

627
00:52:57,268 --> 00:52:59,930
Really? And then
when you come to Italy,

628
00:53:00,038 --> 00:53:02,097
I can show you
around Rome, everything.

629
00:53:02,207 --> 00:53:04,198
The piazzas, the churches, the Forum...

630
00:53:04,309 --> 00:53:05,469
Yes.

631
00:53:08,246 --> 00:53:11,272
I should get them
or the coffee will be frozen.

632
00:53:11,383 --> 00:53:14,079
Come on, boys,
the coffee's getting cold.

633
00:53:15,019 --> 00:53:17,419
I wonder why she seems so hostile.

634
00:53:18,056 --> 00:53:21,025
Does she seem hostile?
But she's nice to me.

635
00:53:21,126 --> 00:53:23,993
She acts like
she knows me a hundred years.

636
00:53:24,095 --> 00:53:26,529
And I don't know why. I never met her.

637
00:53:26,631 --> 00:53:28,428
Don't even know who she is.

638
00:53:28,533 --> 00:53:30,467
She's married to Professor Quadri.

639
00:53:30,568 --> 00:53:32,593
Young enough to be his daughter.

640
00:53:32,704 --> 00:53:36,071
But it doesn't matter. I heard her saying,
"My husband's inside."

641
00:53:36,174 --> 00:53:38,404
- She said "my husband"?
- But certainly.

642
00:53:38,510 --> 00:53:40,603
No, I don't agree.
Printing in the shop is too expensive.

643
00:53:40,712 --> 00:53:42,805
But we'll never accomplish
anything with the mimeograph.

644
00:53:42,914 --> 00:53:46,247
- Thirty thousand copies is no joke...
- It always breaks down.

645
00:54:06,438 --> 00:54:09,839
My husband's still busy.

646
00:54:09,941 --> 00:54:11,568
He'll see you in a few minutes, all right?

647
00:54:11,676 --> 00:54:15,305
- Yes, we've got time.
- He said we might dine tonight.

648
00:54:15,413 --> 00:54:16,675
We'd love to.

649
00:54:16,781 --> 00:54:19,841
Later we might stop
at Joinville and dance.

650
00:54:19,951 --> 00:54:22,681
- You agree?
- Dancing makes me so happy!

651
00:54:23,288 --> 00:54:25,722
Is dancing still allowed in Italy?

652
00:54:26,357 --> 00:54:29,793
Now that I think of it, it's impossible.

653
00:54:29,894 --> 00:54:30,918
Why?

654
00:54:32,664 --> 00:54:34,097
'Cause I didn't bring a gown with me.

655
00:54:34,199 --> 00:54:37,657
We can fix that. This afternoon,
we can shop if you'll come.

656
00:54:37,769 --> 00:54:42,570
- Shouldn't we go immediately?
- No. I have a class at school at 3:30.

657
00:54:42,674 --> 00:54:45,609
But we can meet at your hotel
if you like at 5:00.

658
00:54:45,710 --> 00:54:48,042
- At what hotel are you?
- At the D'Orsay.

659
00:54:48,146 --> 00:54:50,979
- Then we'll see you at 5:00?
- No.

660
00:54:51,516 --> 00:54:54,952
Shopping is only for women.
Husbands pay.

661
00:54:55,053 --> 00:54:57,613
You mean I can go and you won't mind?

662
00:54:57,722 --> 00:54:58,711
No.

663
00:54:59,591 --> 00:55:01,616
Take him to the professor.

664
00:55:19,410 --> 00:55:22,243
Come in, come in, Clerici.
Did they give you coffee?

665
00:55:22,347 --> 00:55:25,475
- Yes, thank you.
- Goodbye. Thank you.

666
00:55:25,583 --> 00:55:26,641
- Giulia.
- Yes.

667
00:55:26,751 --> 00:55:28,013
I'm curious.

668
00:55:28,119 --> 00:55:31,350
Before you married him,
did you go to bed with him?

669
00:55:31,456 --> 00:55:33,515
It's very curious, Clerici.

670
00:55:34,692 --> 00:55:37,661
You come all this way only to see me?

671
00:55:39,364 --> 00:55:40,888
Remember, Professor,

672
00:55:41,633 --> 00:55:43,931
as soon as you used
to enter the classroom

673
00:55:44,035 --> 00:55:46,003
they had to shut the windows.

674
00:55:46,104 --> 00:55:49,073
You couldn't stand all that light,
that noise.

675
00:55:50,208 --> 00:55:52,540
Later, I understood why you used
to do that.

676
00:55:52,644 --> 00:55:54,475
All these years,

677
00:55:54,579 --> 00:55:58,310
you know what remained
most firmly imprinted on my memory?

678
00:55:58,416 --> 00:55:59,747
Your voice.

679
00:56:01,886 --> 00:56:04,946
Imagine a great dungeon
in the shape of a cave.

680
00:56:05,790 --> 00:56:09,692
Inside, men who have
lived there since childhood,

681
00:56:10,595 --> 00:56:14,531
all chained, and forced
to face the back of the cave.

682
00:56:15,567 --> 00:56:19,401
Behind them, far away,
the light from a fire flickers.

683
00:56:20,471 --> 00:56:23,599
Between the fire and the prisoners,
imagine a low wall

684
00:56:23,708 --> 00:56:25,266
similar to that little stage

685
00:56:25,376 --> 00:56:28,004
on which a puppeteer
shows his puppets.

686
00:56:32,250 --> 00:56:34,150
That was November '28.

687
00:56:36,487 --> 00:56:38,250
Yes, I remember.

688
00:56:41,492 --> 00:56:43,892
Now try and imagine some other men

689
00:56:44,829 --> 00:56:47,127
passing behind that little wall

690
00:56:47,966 --> 00:56:51,527
bearing statues
made of wood and stone.

691
00:56:52,403 --> 00:56:54,530
The statues are higher than that wall.

692
00:56:54,639 --> 00:56:58,871
You couldn't have brought me
a better gift than these memories.

693
00:56:58,977 --> 00:57:01,537
The enchained prisoners of Plato.

694
00:57:01,646 --> 00:57:03,773
And how they resemble us.

695
00:57:03,881 --> 00:57:06,714
- And what do they see?
- What do they see?

696
00:57:07,552 --> 00:57:11,352
You who come from Italy
should know from experience.

697
00:57:11,456 --> 00:57:13,788
They see only the shadows
the fire makes

698
00:57:13,891 --> 00:57:16,587
on the back of the cavern
that faces them.

699
00:57:16,694 --> 00:57:18,662
Shadows. The reflections of things.

700
00:57:18,763 --> 00:57:21,960
Like what's happening
to you people now in Italy.

701
00:57:22,533 --> 00:57:25,161
Say those prisoners were at liberty
and could speak out.

702
00:57:25,269 --> 00:57:28,432
Mightn't they call the shadows
they see reality, not visions?

703
00:57:28,539 --> 00:57:33,704
Yes. They would mistake for reality,
the shadows of reality.

704
00:57:35,546 --> 00:57:37,844
The myth of the great cave.

705
00:57:38,282 --> 00:57:40,978
That was the graduate thesis
you proposed to do for me.

706
00:57:41,085 --> 00:57:44,714
- Did you finish it afterwards?
- You departed. I used a different theme.

707
00:57:44,822 --> 00:57:48,485
I'm truly sorry, Clerici.
I had so much faith in you.

708
00:57:50,228 --> 00:57:52,696
- In all of you.
- No, I don't believe it.

709
00:57:52,797 --> 00:57:55,766
If that were true,
you'd never have left Rome.

710
00:57:56,167 --> 00:57:58,567
That's fine. Go on!

711
00:58:00,204 --> 00:58:02,138
Move faster. Move faster.

712
00:58:02,740 --> 00:58:04,799
Move faster. Move faster.

713
00:58:05,143 --> 00:58:07,077
Move faster. Move faster.

714
00:58:07,178 --> 00:58:10,705
At the point we had reached
there was no other choice.

715
00:58:10,815 --> 00:58:12,806
All we could do was emigrate.
We wanted everyone

716
00:58:12,917 --> 00:58:16,114
to be able to feel our disdain,
and our rebellion as exiles,

717
00:58:16,220 --> 00:58:19,417
the meaning of our struggle,
the historical meaning.

718
00:58:19,524 --> 00:58:22,891
Beautiful words, but you left
and I became a Fascist.

719
00:58:23,227 --> 00:58:24,990
Excuse me, Clerici,

720
00:58:25,496 --> 00:58:28,522
but a confirmed Fascist
doesn't talk like that.

721
00:58:34,372 --> 00:58:38,308
Yes? Yes, it's me. Yes. Go ahead.

722
00:58:43,147 --> 00:58:45,445
One lover? Only one?

723
00:58:46,384 --> 00:58:48,249
She went down and out.

724
00:58:48,352 --> 00:58:50,718
She gave her all for a redheaded pimp
with a bloodshot eye.

725
00:58:50,822 --> 00:58:54,349
A Jew he was, with a garlic smell.
Who'd come from Formosa once,

726
00:58:54,459 --> 00:58:57,053
and hauled her out of
some whorehouse in Shanghai.

727
00:58:57,161 --> 00:58:59,220
You really will lend me these foxes?

728
00:58:59,330 --> 00:59:01,059
Of course.
Keep them as long as you like.

729
00:59:01,165 --> 00:59:02,496
Thank you.

730
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:11,972
Wait for me. I'll be right back.

731
00:59:25,857 --> 00:59:27,950
Do you often go around
people's houses spying?

732
00:59:28,059 --> 00:59:30,550
How often do I honeymoon in France?

733
00:59:30,995 --> 00:59:33,225
I met a woman with your eyes.

734
00:59:33,631 --> 00:59:35,394
- Where?
- Ventimiglia.

735
00:59:37,802 --> 00:59:40,168
The resemblance is unbelievable.

736
00:59:41,472 --> 00:59:44,202
- And who was she?
- A prostitute.

737
00:59:49,647 --> 00:59:51,012
Many thanks.

738
00:59:51,816 --> 00:59:54,979
- Did she kiss well?
- It would be like kissing you.

739
00:59:57,455 --> 00:59:59,855
- How did it end up then?
- It didn't.

740
00:59:59,957 --> 01:00:02,255
I embraced her and that was it.

741
01:00:03,294 --> 01:00:06,661
I was left with this great desire
to find her again.

742
01:00:06,764 --> 01:00:10,894
- Why are you so hostile?
- Because I'm sincere.

743
01:00:14,505 --> 01:00:16,473
Over here she had a scar.

744
01:00:20,144 --> 01:00:24,547
No! No! Let me go!

745
01:01:25,309 --> 01:01:27,072
Who knows what it's for?

746
01:01:27,178 --> 01:01:29,078
But it isn't gold the way I imagined.

747
01:01:29,180 --> 01:01:32,274
From here it's almost as small
as the one I have on my night table.

748
01:01:32,383 --> 01:01:33,941
They say at least once a month,

749
01:01:34,051 --> 01:01:37,452
some disappointed lover
throws himself off. How stupid.

750
01:01:38,155 --> 01:01:40,919
- You want to go to the Tower?
- Yes.

751
01:01:47,164 --> 01:01:48,222
Taxi!

752
01:01:48,332 --> 01:01:52,029
Yes. I'm glad we're going up
the Eiffel Tower.

753
01:02:01,245 --> 01:02:04,043
Quick! To the Eiffel Tower. <i>Ciao!</i>

754
01:02:04,982 --> 01:02:07,576
And you?

755
01:02:20,665 --> 01:02:21,996
Attention!

756
01:02:22,733 --> 01:02:25,566
Now, supple. Go on. Hup!

757
01:02:27,338 --> 01:02:29,101
Helene dear, chin up.

758
01:02:32,109 --> 01:02:33,167
Hup!

759
01:02:35,246 --> 01:02:36,873
Try it again now.

760
01:02:40,718 --> 01:02:43,152
Watch your knees, Denise.

761
01:02:44,622 --> 01:02:46,112
Take a breath.

762
01:02:50,428 --> 01:02:53,124
That's starting to look good, isn't it?

763
01:02:57,735 --> 01:02:59,032
Your head.

764
01:03:04,475 --> 01:03:06,033
Your points out.

765
01:03:07,345 --> 01:03:09,040
Eyes still, Margot.

766
01:03:21,592 --> 01:03:23,025
Take a break.

767
01:03:26,130 --> 01:03:27,791
Thank you, madame.

768
01:03:35,806 --> 01:03:38,206
- Is there some place to talk?
- Here.

769
01:03:38,309 --> 01:03:40,209
- No, not here.
- Why not?

770
01:03:52,390 --> 01:03:54,620
I have some friends in Brazil.

771
01:03:54,892 --> 01:03:57,690
I'll leave everything if you come with me.

772
01:03:59,163 --> 01:04:02,132
I, on the other hand,
have friends in Italy.

773
01:04:02,233 --> 01:04:04,428
I received a letter. Read it.

774
01:04:08,339 --> 01:04:12,742
"If you ever get this letter,
it will be in spite of the prison censors."

775
01:04:13,444 --> 01:04:16,811
You must never make the gesture
as wide as this.

776
01:04:18,616 --> 01:04:20,584
Why did you stop? Go on.

777
01:04:23,487 --> 01:04:25,978
"They come suddenly in the night
and kick the door of my cell

778
01:04:26,090 --> 01:04:28,183
"so as not to let me sleep."

779
01:04:29,660 --> 01:04:31,594
- Why do...
- Continue.

780
01:04:31,695 --> 01:04:34,095
Why do you make me read this letter?

781
01:04:34,198 --> 01:04:36,063
I'll tell you in a bit.

782
01:04:37,735 --> 01:04:40,636
"Some days,
there are the false executions.

783
01:04:41,705 --> 01:04:44,435
"They sent me the priest
three times already

784
01:04:44,542 --> 01:04:47,067
"and I refused extreme unction.

785
01:04:47,178 --> 01:04:49,544
"They gave me castor oil again,
but they should realize

786
01:04:49,647 --> 01:04:51,740
"that after almost 20 years,

787
01:04:52,583 --> 01:04:55,074
"I'm used to it. It has no effect."

788
01:04:56,053 --> 01:04:57,953
Why must I read this letter?

789
01:04:58,055 --> 01:05:00,148
You want me to tell you?

790
01:05:00,257 --> 01:05:02,589
Because you're a Fascist! A spy!

791
01:05:03,194 --> 01:05:06,095
You imagine you took us in?
You're mistaken.

792
01:05:08,466 --> 01:05:09,899
Does your husband know?

793
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,264
Why do you think you were received?

794
01:05:13,804 --> 01:05:15,237
You're only a worm.

795
01:05:15,339 --> 01:05:17,739
You revolt me! You're disgusting!

796
01:05:19,710 --> 01:05:22,042
I'm getting Giulia at the hotel.

797
01:05:22,146 --> 01:05:24,137
We'll be on the first train home.

798
01:05:24,248 --> 01:05:27,274
You'd never do it.
You're too much of a coward.

799
01:05:52,810 --> 01:05:54,744
Marcello! Hold me.

800
01:06:05,489 --> 01:06:07,457
Marcello, I'm frightened.

801
01:06:10,094 --> 01:06:12,392
Marcello, please don't hurt us.

802
01:06:16,967 --> 01:06:19,458
Swear it! Swear it, please.

803
01:06:20,538 --> 01:06:21,971
I don't know.

804
01:07:05,282 --> 01:07:07,045
Giulia, look at this.

805
01:07:14,058 --> 01:07:15,787
Anna! Come here!

806
01:07:18,295 --> 01:07:19,853
It's a surprise!

807
01:07:22,566 --> 01:07:26,002
Look at that color. It's a dream!

808
01:07:26,103 --> 01:07:28,833
Come and look at this one. Here.

809
01:07:32,343 --> 01:07:35,141
Anna! It's divine!

810
01:07:37,381 --> 01:07:39,872
Look how beautiful it is! Just look!

811
01:07:42,519 --> 01:07:44,077
Giulia, come on.

812
01:08:00,137 --> 01:08:03,231
It's very big, all in wood,
with enormous beds.

813
01:08:03,607 --> 01:08:05,006
The house belonged to my grandfather.

814
01:08:05,109 --> 01:08:07,202
Luca and I used to go there often.

815
01:08:07,311 --> 01:08:08,801
Roby, here!

816
01:08:08,912 --> 01:08:12,871
But now with what's going on in Spain,
we don't leave Paris any longer.

817
01:08:12,983 --> 01:08:15,747
All right, Roby! That's enough!
Come here!

818
01:08:16,053 --> 01:08:18,817
La Savoie is beautiful.
I can't wait to get back.

819
01:08:36,507 --> 01:08:40,534
<i>Dottore! Dottore!</i>

820
01:08:41,211 --> 01:08:43,839
Come on, I know you're back there.

821
01:08:43,947 --> 01:08:46,438
Why don't you want to see me?

822
01:08:46,550 --> 01:08:48,745
I've been running after you all day.

823
01:08:48,852 --> 01:08:51,548
And it's freezing here.

824
01:08:54,792 --> 01:08:57,590
You ought to come out
and have a chat now.

825
01:08:59,129 --> 01:09:01,563
What is it you're worrying about?

826
01:09:01,999 --> 01:09:05,025
We'll go somewhere inside.
We'll talk about it.

827
01:09:06,704 --> 01:09:08,672
I have my job, you know.

828
01:09:09,973 --> 01:09:11,702
The time's passing.

829
01:09:14,244 --> 01:09:18,408
You must have a plan by now.

830
01:09:18,782 --> 01:09:21,478
You haven't stood still for an instant.

831
01:09:22,686 --> 01:09:25,814
May I say you ought to be following him,
not his wife.

832
01:09:25,923 --> 01:09:29,290
There's no point in screaming like that
at the birds, you know.

833
01:09:29,393 --> 01:09:32,294
They don't understand
you foreigners. Maniac.

834
01:09:32,496 --> 01:09:35,363
He thinks the birds
in Paris are foreigners.

835
01:09:36,467 --> 01:09:39,493
God damn it. <i>Dottore!</i>

836
01:09:40,170 --> 01:09:41,967
I do understand you.

837
01:09:42,473 --> 01:09:45,374
But the operation must be
quick and decisive.

838
01:09:56,920 --> 01:09:58,285
Third floor.

839
01:10:28,218 --> 01:10:30,448
You don't mind if we stay like this a bit?

840
01:10:30,554 --> 01:10:31,521
No.

841
01:10:31,622 --> 01:10:33,317
How silly you are.

842
01:10:33,424 --> 01:10:35,984
Remember what you yourself said
a while ago,

843
01:10:36,093 --> 01:10:38,152
"If I weren't married," you said.

844
01:10:38,262 --> 01:10:41,425
Yes, I might have said that.
I am married.

845
01:10:41,532 --> 01:10:43,466
It doesn't mean a thing.

846
01:10:44,968 --> 01:10:47,664
You have to understand
married to whom.

847
01:10:47,771 --> 01:10:49,102
I like him.

848
01:11:16,135 --> 01:11:17,659
Let's try on my new frock.

849
01:11:17,770 --> 01:11:21,399
No. Don't move. I want to dress you.

850
01:11:25,979 --> 01:11:29,881
How strange you are.
You want to be my maid now?

851
01:11:31,050 --> 01:11:34,076
What difference does it make?
It's my pleasure.

852
01:11:46,032 --> 01:11:48,762
Please, don't look at me.
I'm embarrassed.

853
01:11:48,868 --> 01:11:51,996
There's nothing wrong with it.
I'm a woman just as you are.

854
01:11:52,105 --> 01:11:55,268
Yes, but you look at me in a way...

855
01:11:55,375 --> 01:11:56,740
Turn around.

856
01:12:01,481 --> 01:12:03,415
How beautiful!

857
01:12:06,519 --> 01:12:08,919
How much I love Paris!

858
01:12:11,357 --> 01:12:13,188
When Marcello sees it!

859
01:12:34,347 --> 01:12:36,542
Violets? Violets, <i>monsieur?</i>

860
01:12:39,218 --> 01:12:40,947
Do you want violets?

861
01:12:41,621 --> 01:12:43,816
These are real Parma violets.

862
01:12:45,558 --> 01:12:47,719
- They're really from Parma?
- Absolutely.

863
01:12:47,827 --> 01:12:49,419
Let me have one.

864
01:12:50,930 --> 01:12:52,261
Thank you.

865
01:12:52,966 --> 01:12:54,934
"Ye prisoners of starvation!"

866
01:12:55,034 --> 01:12:58,026
<i>Arise ye prisoners of starvation</i>

867
01:12:58,137 --> 01:13:00,935

01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:04,441

01:13:04,544 --> 01:13:07,877

01:13:11,751 --> 01:13:14,982
<i>Arise ye slaves no more in thrall</i>

872
01:13:15,088 --> 01:13:18,387
<i>The earth shall rise on new foundations</i>

873
01:13:18,491 --> 01:13:22,154
<i>We have been naught, we shall be all</i>

874
01:13:26,766 --> 01:13:30,224
<i>'Tis the final conflict</i>

01:13:30,336 --> 01:13:33,635

01:13:33,740 --> 01:13:37,836

01:13:53,226 --> 01:13:56,093
<i>Shall lead the human race</i>

882
01:13:56,763 --> 01:13:57,923
Inside.

883
01:13:59,999 --> 01:14:01,990
- Come.
- What's the matter?

884
01:14:09,208 --> 01:14:12,575
- Do you like real Parma violets?
- They're not for me.

885
01:14:15,882 --> 01:14:17,816
I want you to have them.

886
01:14:18,317 --> 01:14:21,184
You couldn't have known
I'd be at the hotel.

887
01:14:21,721 --> 01:14:23,416
They're for Giulia.

888
01:14:24,724 --> 01:14:26,885
It's for you I bought them.

889
01:14:49,916 --> 01:14:51,781
Giulia will be beautiful tonight.

890
01:14:51,884 --> 01:14:54,079
Half past eight at the hotel.

891
01:14:59,725 --> 01:15:01,352
You know, I'm sad.

892
01:15:02,061 --> 01:15:05,519
Since we've arrived in Paris,
we haven't made love yet.

893
01:15:11,504 --> 01:15:15,565
Your knees are sharp.

894
01:15:30,123 --> 01:15:31,886
Here's news for you.

895
01:15:32,225 --> 01:15:34,750
The Quadris have a house
in the Savoie.

896
01:15:35,094 --> 01:15:37,426
Anna says the Professor leaves
tomorrow morning by car

897
01:15:37,530 --> 01:15:39,020
while she stays here.

898
01:15:39,132 --> 01:15:41,965
Only for a day or so, then she's
planning to join her husband

899
01:15:42,068 --> 01:15:45,060
and wants us to visit with them
in the mountains.

900
01:15:45,171 --> 01:15:46,866
I have the address.

901
01:15:49,475 --> 01:15:51,443
Nice, don't you think so?

902
01:15:58,251 --> 01:16:00,845
She told me they have
enormous beds in their villa

903
01:16:00,953 --> 01:16:03,387
which make awful noises!

904
01:16:06,492 --> 01:16:09,120
And she says there are big,
big forests in the neighborhood

905
01:16:09,228 --> 01:16:11,219
where no one ever passes.

906
01:16:17,403 --> 01:16:19,166
Anna says...

907
01:16:19,605 --> 01:16:22,665
Anna told me you can even
make love in the snow.

908
01:16:25,811 --> 01:16:29,907
Can you imagine the Professor
wandering around in the woods naked?

909
01:16:30,483 --> 01:16:33,748
You had me convinced
you were the typical new Italian.

910
01:16:33,853 --> 01:16:36,185
No such type exists yet,
but we're creating him.

911
01:16:36,289 --> 01:16:39,087
- Through repression?
- No, through example.

912
01:16:39,458 --> 01:16:42,950
Giving him castor oil?
Throwing him into prison?

913
01:16:43,529 --> 01:16:45,292
By torturing them? Blackmailing?

914
01:16:45,398 --> 01:16:48,492
Anna. Please, dear, calm down.

915
01:16:50,169 --> 01:16:53,002
Clerici is a Fascist. I'm an Anti-Fascist.

916
01:16:54,073 --> 01:16:55,506
We both knew.

917
01:16:56,075 --> 01:16:58,009
And we decided to have supper
together all the same.

918
01:16:58,110 --> 01:17:01,136
- And get the wives drunk.
- The old Professor and his ex-pupil.

919
01:17:01,247 --> 01:17:05,518
- Giulia, what's the matter?
- And yet I'm willing to bet.

920
01:17:05,518 --> 01:17:05,813
- Giulia, what's the matter?
- And yet I'm willing to bet.

921
01:17:05,918 --> 01:17:07,317
God, I've drunk so much!

922
01:17:07,420 --> 01:17:10,947
- You may change your mind yet.
- Impossible, Professor.

923
01:17:11,791 --> 01:17:14,817
My husband is naive about these things.

924
01:17:15,695 --> 01:17:19,153
I can't forget that Clerici was
one of my best students ever.

925
01:17:19,265 --> 01:17:23,326
Really? Tell me.
What was Marcello like as a student?

926
01:17:23,436 --> 01:17:26,701
- Serious. Too serious.
- But you can't be too serious.

927
01:17:26,806 --> 01:17:28,740
Really serious people are never serious.

928
01:17:28,841 --> 01:17:32,038
Giulia, did you ever see
your husband laugh?

929
01:17:32,144 --> 01:17:34,874
No, but then, he's a very serious man.
That's his nature.

930
01:17:34,981 --> 01:17:37,347
- Nothing the matter with that.
- That's not my nature at all.

931
01:17:37,450 --> 01:17:40,044
I've an idea, Clerici.
You should both remain here.

932
01:17:40,152 --> 01:17:43,246
You will understand a great deal
about many things living here.

933
01:17:43,356 --> 01:17:45,984
For you, it's an important opportunity.

934
01:17:46,726 --> 01:17:48,819
What do you know, Professor?

935
01:17:49,028 --> 01:17:50,188
He's right.

936
01:17:50,296 --> 01:17:53,060
He's only in Paris
to enjoy his honeymoon.

937
01:17:53,165 --> 01:17:55,133
By the way,
did Giulia mention my idea to you?

938
01:17:55,234 --> 01:17:57,896
- We have a lovely guest room...
- With an enormous bed!

939
01:17:58,004 --> 01:18:00,472
And from la Savoie
you can go back to Italy.

940
01:18:00,573 --> 01:18:03,007
Thank you,
but I promised Giulia to show her Paris.

941
01:18:03,109 --> 01:18:04,804
I'm half-drunk already!

942
01:18:04,910 --> 01:18:07,378
That's splendid.
My husband will leave tomorrow.

943
01:18:07,480 --> 01:18:10,847
And after you see some more of Paris,
we'll join him.

944
01:18:14,620 --> 01:18:17,180
Marcello, tell the truth.
Would you like us to go?

945
01:18:17,290 --> 01:18:20,282
But of course I would.
They're really so kind.

946
01:18:20,860 --> 01:18:24,023
- Well, all right.
- Perhaps Giulia doesn't want to go.

947
01:18:24,130 --> 01:18:25,188
No, no!

948
01:18:25,298 --> 01:18:27,766
If you don't like me, you can just say so.

949
01:18:28,734 --> 01:18:30,861
Don't embarrass dear Giulia.

950
01:18:32,238 --> 01:18:35,435
- We'll definitely come. Right, Giulia?
- Yes.

951
01:18:36,909 --> 01:18:38,501
Let me sit there.

952
01:18:44,317 --> 01:18:47,013
God, it's going around, the whole place.

953
01:18:48,120 --> 01:18:51,317
It's like that restaurant
we had on the train

954
01:18:54,493 --> 01:18:56,620
with that funny fat man.

955
01:19:06,005 --> 01:19:09,497
Marcello, will you give me
a proof of your friendship?

956
01:19:10,843 --> 01:19:14,006
There's something to be sent. A letter.

957
01:19:15,014 --> 01:19:18,916
To Rome. To a comrade.
I ask you to help me.

958
01:19:19,885 --> 01:19:22,615
It has to be delivered personally.
There's no hurry.

959
01:19:22,722 --> 01:19:24,952
When you get back to Italy
from our place.

960
01:19:25,057 --> 01:19:26,922
This might mean prison.

961
01:19:27,026 --> 01:19:29,187
Any one of my men
would risk much more.

962
01:19:29,295 --> 01:19:31,388
Professor, one would say
you're doing this purposely,

963
01:19:31,497 --> 01:19:33,897
just to get me into trouble there.

964
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:36,995
Considering what you're
going back to, Clerici,

965
01:19:37,103 --> 01:19:40,470
- a month in a Fascist jail may be better.
- Excuse me.

966
01:19:54,687 --> 01:19:56,018
What is it?

967
01:19:57,757 --> 01:19:59,384
What's the matter?

968
01:20:01,193 --> 01:20:03,127
Hey, <i>Dottore!</i> Watch out!

969
01:20:04,864 --> 01:20:08,300
What? I'm here to protect you
and you want to kill me?

970
01:20:09,268 --> 01:20:13,500
I don't want to kill anyone. Here.
I don't want to carry it anymore.

971
01:20:15,641 --> 01:20:17,506
What is this all about?

972
01:20:18,711 --> 01:20:22,203
- You giving up?
- No, it's so clumsy.

973
01:20:23,616 --> 01:20:27,347
I don't even know how to use it.
It's in my way, it's so heavy.

974
01:20:33,993 --> 01:20:37,588
Listen to me, comrade!

975
01:20:38,397 --> 01:20:40,865
I want you to look straight at me.

976
01:20:41,233 --> 01:20:44,794
We're in a war, right?
You give up, you're a deserter.

977
01:20:47,706 --> 01:20:50,539
Everybody's thought
of deserting at least once.

978
01:20:50,643 --> 01:20:54,443
- I wouldn't think of that.
- Even I did. Really. Yes, yes, yes.

979
01:20:55,080 --> 01:20:59,380
But I said to myself, " Manganiello,
why, what are you thinking of?"

980
01:20:59,485 --> 01:21:01,476
It isn't your patriotism,

981
01:21:01,687 --> 01:21:04,315
it isn't your honor you are betraying.

982
01:21:05,057 --> 01:21:06,649
It is really you.

983
01:21:07,893 --> 01:21:09,451
After a while,

984
01:21:10,329 --> 01:21:13,856
I managed a hearty pat on my back,
smoked another cigar,

985
01:21:14,266 --> 01:21:17,724
and what did I think? " Let's go.

986
01:21:19,071 --> 01:21:20,595
"Courage now.

987
01:21:22,141 --> 01:21:24,041
"Comrade Manganiello?"

988
01:21:24,877 --> 01:21:26,572
Fight or be beaten.

989
01:21:27,813 --> 01:21:29,280
It's freezing!

990
01:21:29,982 --> 01:21:32,109
Hurry. We're going to dance.

991
01:21:32,885 --> 01:21:34,648
You'll make me fall!

992
01:22:14,226 --> 01:22:15,420
Come on.

993
01:22:23,969 --> 01:22:25,061
Thanks.

994
01:22:25,170 --> 01:22:26,569
If you were what you say,

995
01:22:26,672 --> 01:22:28,970
you would have agreed
to carry that letter

996
01:22:29,074 --> 01:22:32,510
and you would have used it
against our friends in Rome.

997
01:22:39,451 --> 01:22:42,420
Well, take a look.
There's nothing written.

998
01:22:43,989 --> 01:22:46,822
I thought it best to put you to the test.

999
01:23:21,827 --> 01:23:23,954
They must stop dancing.

1000
01:23:24,363 --> 01:23:25,557
But why?

1001
01:23:27,199 --> 01:23:29,064
They're both so pretty.

1002
01:23:45,384 --> 01:23:47,750
Well, what's there to stare at?

1003
01:23:47,853 --> 01:23:52,449
This is Paris,
and I'm a fashionable woman, aren't I?

1004
01:23:52,558 --> 01:23:55,652
- You're crazy, completely.
- All right. Let's dance!

1005
01:23:55,761 --> 01:23:58,093
Everyone! All of you!

1006
01:23:58,731 --> 01:24:02,633
Everybody, come on!

1007
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:10,268
- Tomorrow by car at dawn.
- Wait!

1008
01:25:10,369 --> 01:25:12,929
- What about his wife?
- She doesn't go.

1009
01:25:14,106 --> 01:25:15,801
Better without her.

1010
01:25:16,308 --> 01:25:18,003
We'll meet in Rome!

1011
01:25:18,844 --> 01:25:20,937
And the best of luck to you!

1012
01:26:24,209 --> 01:26:27,508
Who knows what
you think of me, Professor?

1013
01:26:27,613 --> 01:26:29,706
I've had too much champagne!

1014
01:26:31,583 --> 01:26:34,108
It's good for anybody
to get drunk once in a while.

1015
01:26:34,219 --> 01:26:35,914
You won't believe this.

1016
01:26:36,021 --> 01:26:38,717
You upset me like
you're giving me an exam.

1017
01:26:38,824 --> 01:26:41,622
If you're prepared, everybody'll pass?

1018
01:26:54,640 --> 01:26:58,235
Listen. I'll be going tomorrow
with my husband.

1019
01:26:59,077 --> 01:27:00,635
You must remain.

1020
01:27:05,617 --> 01:27:08,108
Please remain in town. Do it for me.

1021
01:27:08,387 --> 01:27:10,480
Didn't you decide to go
with Giulia and me?

1022
01:27:10,589 --> 01:27:13,524
Haven't you observed
she can't stand me, your Giulia?

1023
01:27:14,059 --> 01:27:15,083
Pardon!

1024
01:27:15,194 --> 01:27:17,822
But Giulia's so stupid.
Can't you see she's drunk?

1025
01:27:17,930 --> 01:27:20,296
We've all lost our heads a little tonight.

1026
01:27:20,399 --> 01:27:23,493
Besides, you're mistaken
to say she can't bear you.

1027
01:27:23,602 --> 01:27:26,969
She mentioned that she admires you.

1028
01:27:28,841 --> 01:27:33,972
- What else did she say?
- That she finds you seductive.

1029
01:27:35,814 --> 01:27:37,441
I changed my mind.

1030
01:27:38,750 --> 01:27:44,052
I'll stay with you in Paris. Glad?

1031
01:27:44,456 --> 01:27:47,391
Anna! The Professor
is propositioning me!

1032
01:27:47,693 --> 01:27:48,887
Help!

1033
01:27:48,994 --> 01:27:53,522
I feel so happy that in a minute
I know I'm going to feel terrible!

1034
01:27:54,099 --> 01:27:55,361
<i>Ciao!</i>

1035
01:28:20,325 --> 01:28:24,386
Damn. I'm beginning to get tired.

1036
01:28:39,745 --> 01:28:41,872
- Manganiello.
- Yes, <i>Dottore.</i>

1037
01:28:43,048 --> 01:28:45,846
- I've just had a fantastic dream.
- You did?

1038
01:28:46,418 --> 01:28:48,215
I was in Switzerland.

1039
01:28:48,320 --> 01:28:50,550
And you were taking me
for an operation in a hospital

1040
01:28:50,656 --> 01:28:51,850
because I was blind.

1041
01:28:51,957 --> 01:28:54,084
Switzerland. It's beautiful.

1042
01:28:54,393 --> 01:28:56,725
And Professor Quadri did the operation.

1043
01:28:57,262 --> 01:29:00,720
The operation was a success
and I was leaving soon

1044
01:29:01,433 --> 01:29:04,596
with the wife of the Professor.
And she loved me.

1045
01:29:08,907 --> 01:29:10,306
Switzerland.

1046
01:29:10,676 --> 01:29:12,541
I remember in Milan

1047
01:29:12,644 --> 01:29:14,942
when I was a child,
we used to sing a song.

1048
01:29:15,047 --> 01:29:16,378
Wait a minute.

1049
01:29:40,172 --> 01:29:42,436
In Africa after all that work
and four dead men,

1050
01:29:42,541 --> 01:29:45,237
we discovered
it was no longer necessary.

1051
01:29:45,944 --> 01:29:49,607
And my superior,
"You have ruined us all!

1052
01:29:49,715 --> 01:29:51,808
"You're only beasts, you are!"

1053
01:29:51,917 --> 01:29:55,353
"Now wait a second," I said.
"We are men, not beasts."

1054
01:30:00,959 --> 01:30:02,859
That woman should have
returned to her bed

1055
01:30:02,961 --> 01:30:04,929
and stayed there all day.

1056
01:30:08,266 --> 01:30:09,563
God!

1057
01:30:09,668 --> 01:30:12,933
- Love can certainly...
- What are you trying to say?

1058
01:30:15,040 --> 01:30:17,008
No. Nothing, <i>Dottore.</i>

1059
01:30:17,576 --> 01:30:21,603
No. I was saying that sometimes
love can even perform miracles.

1060
01:30:33,191 --> 01:30:34,317
There!

1061
01:30:36,528 --> 01:30:38,291
It's them, isn't it?

1062
01:30:39,998 --> 01:30:41,966
Keep about 60 feet back.

1063
01:30:59,184 --> 01:31:00,446
There's a car behind us.

1064
01:31:00,552 --> 01:31:01,917
- So?
- Following us.

1065
01:31:02,020 --> 01:31:04,955
Nothing the matter with that.
Why are you so nervous?

1066
01:31:15,967 --> 01:31:17,264
Watch out!

1067
01:31:32,451 --> 01:31:34,646
Must be something the matter.

1068
01:31:34,753 --> 01:31:36,880
Don't get out, please, I beg you!

1069
01:31:36,988 --> 01:31:40,185
- Well, why not?
- I don't know, but I'm frightened.

1070
01:32:27,405 --> 01:32:29,839
We can't just sit here like this.

1071
01:32:29,941 --> 01:32:31,670
I'll be right back.

1072
01:32:32,644 --> 01:32:33,941
Wait here.

1073
01:32:36,615 --> 01:32:37,673
Luca!

1074
01:33:21,826 --> 01:33:23,521
I thought you were ill.

1075
01:33:23,628 --> 01:33:26,222
What is it? What do you want from me?

1076
01:34:58,523 --> 01:35:00,388
Look out, I'm shooting.

1077
01:35:37,128 --> 01:35:40,063
How disgusting. I've always said so.

1078
01:35:40,165 --> 01:35:43,896
Make me work in the shit,
sure, but not with a coward.

1079
01:35:44,002 --> 01:35:46,664
If it's up to me, cowards,
homosexuals and Jews,

1080
01:35:46,771 --> 01:35:48,170
they're all the same thing.

1081
01:35:49,908 --> 01:35:53,344
If it were up to me,
I'd stand them all against a wall.

1082
01:35:56,815 --> 01:36:01,343
Better yet,
eliminate them when they're born.

1083
01:37:38,349 --> 01:37:39,646
<i>Attention.</i>

1084
01:37:41,653 --> 01:37:43,052
<i>Attention.</i>

1085
01:37:44,522 --> 01:37:48,219
<i>His Majesty King Vittorio Emanuele</i>

1086

<i>His Excellency Marshal Pietro Badoglio.</i>

1091
01:38:19,224 --> 01:38:22,352
How elegant you are
with your mama's hat on!

1092
01:38:26,197 --> 01:38:28,722
You even put on the foxes
Mama brought from Paris.

1093
01:38:28,833 --> 01:38:30,232
Good for Marta!

1094
01:38:30,335 --> 01:38:33,793
<i>King Vittorio Emanuele has</i>

1100
01:39:17,081 --> 01:39:18,742
A red apple.

1101
01:39:22,353 --> 01:39:25,652
Ready? Hail Mary, full of grace...

1102
01:39:25,757 --> 01:39:27,850
"Hail Mary, full of grace..."

1103
01:39:27,959 --> 01:39:31,019
- the Lord is with Thee.
- "The Lord is with Thee."

1104
01:39:31,129 --> 01:39:35,759
- Blessed art Thou amongst women...
- "Blessed art Thou amongst women..."

1105
01:39:36,467 --> 01:39:39,630
...and blessed is the fruit
of Thy womb, Jesus.

1106
01:39:41,239 --> 01:39:43,707
"...the fruit of Thy womb, Jesus."

1107
01:39:44,776 --> 01:39:46,869
Holy Mary, Mother of God...

1108
01:39:47,979 --> 01:39:50,209
"Holy Mary, Mother of God..."

1109
01:39:50,315 --> 01:39:52,840
...pray for us sinners...

1110
01:39:52,951 --> 01:39:55,112
"...pray for us sinners..."

1111
01:39:55,219 --> 01:39:59,883
...now and at the hour of our death.
- "...now and at the hour of our death."

1112
01:39:59,991 --> 01:40:01,219
Italo called.

1113
01:40:01,326 --> 01:40:03,658
- Amen.
- "Amen."

1114
01:40:05,363 --> 01:40:08,355
Now to sleep.
Come on, lie down and sleep.

1115
01:40:12,537 --> 01:40:15,938
- Italo?
- Yes. Italo.

1116
01:40:20,612 --> 01:40:24,241
- What did he want?
- He'll expect you at the usual place.

1117
01:40:27,885 --> 01:40:30,683
<i>Italo. After all this time.</i>

1118
01:40:38,696 --> 01:40:40,687
How awful they all are!

1119
01:40:41,366 --> 01:40:43,994
Celebrating because
the King threw out Mussolini,

1120
01:40:44,102 --> 01:40:46,593
when yesterday they were all for him.

1121
01:40:46,704 --> 01:40:48,934
I can't wait till we get them out of here.

1122
01:40:49,040 --> 01:40:51,565
Why see Italo? What's the use of it?

1123
01:40:52,410 --> 01:40:55,573
If he called it means he needs me,
and I'm going.

1124
01:40:57,482 --> 01:41:00,212
I was always the one
who took him around.

1125
01:41:00,818 --> 01:41:02,649
I took him everywhere.

1126
01:41:03,921 --> 01:41:06,890
He used to say that
when I described things to him

1127
01:41:06,991 --> 01:41:09,755
it was like seeing them
with his own eyes.

1128
01:41:10,895 --> 01:41:12,294
Go to sleep.

1129
01:41:14,298 --> 01:41:16,027
Marcello, you've got to take care,
you hear?

1130
01:41:16,134 --> 01:41:17,158
Why?

1131
01:41:18,102 --> 01:41:19,694
What do you mean?

1132
01:41:22,040 --> 01:41:23,234
Nothing.

1133
01:41:26,644 --> 01:41:30,136
Wait, listen.
What are you going to do now?

1134
01:41:30,248 --> 01:41:33,046
The same as everyone else
who thought like me.

1135
01:41:35,086 --> 01:41:37,520
When there are so many of us,
there's no risk.

1136
01:41:37,622 --> 01:41:40,955
I know, but I want to say
the business with Quadri...

1137
01:41:53,571 --> 01:41:56,267
I don't know what you're talking about.

1138
01:41:59,544 --> 01:42:01,637
In Paris, Anna,

1139
01:42:02,980 --> 01:42:05,676
maybe in order
to get me away from you,

1140
01:42:06,217 --> 01:42:08,913
told me you worked
for the secret police.

1141
01:42:11,289 --> 01:42:15,123
- And you? What did you answer?
- That it wasn't important.

1142
01:42:15,493 --> 01:42:18,087
That I was your wife and I loved you.

1143
01:42:19,330 --> 01:42:22,493
And if you worked for them,
it was your decision.

1144
01:42:26,404 --> 01:42:30,602
But then, when the Quadris were killed,

1145
01:42:30,708 --> 01:42:34,235
how scared I became.

1146
01:42:42,253 --> 01:42:44,551
And what do you think of it now?

1147
01:42:49,460 --> 01:42:51,792
Well, I think that, after all,

1148
01:42:54,465 --> 01:42:57,195
it was an important step in your career.

1149
01:42:58,102 --> 01:42:59,535
That's right.

1150
01:43:02,440 --> 01:43:04,305
Marcello, don't go out!

1151
01:43:08,880 --> 01:43:10,643
They could hurt you.

1152
01:43:10,848 --> 01:43:12,748
I won't be in danger.

1153
01:43:13,918 --> 01:43:16,546
After all, what have I done? My duty.

1154
01:43:17,221 --> 01:43:19,212
But why do you want to go?

1155
01:43:21,125 --> 01:43:23,855
I want to see how a dictatorship falls.

1156
01:43:36,340 --> 01:43:39,798
Mama! Where are you? I'm afraid.

1157
01:43:41,913 --> 01:43:44,108
I'm here, darling. I'm coming.

1158
01:44:01,399 --> 01:44:02,627
Marcello?

1159
01:44:08,339 --> 01:44:11,240
There's something
that's still stuck to you.

1160
01:44:12,777 --> 01:44:14,677
- Where?
- Here.

1161
01:44:15,680 --> 01:44:16,908
Oh, yes.

1162
01:44:57,388 --> 01:44:58,753
What about eating?

1163
01:44:58,856 --> 01:45:01,381
As long as there are cats around,
I manage.

1164
01:45:01,492 --> 01:45:04,154
They say cat meat tastes like rabbit.

1165
01:45:04,262 --> 01:45:06,196
Too bad we didn't meet yesterday.

1166
01:45:06,297 --> 01:45:08,356
I had a whipped cream cake at home.

1167
01:45:08,466 --> 01:45:10,593
- With real cream?
- Yes, why not?

1168
01:45:10,701 --> 01:45:13,261
- You need eggs for that.
- Somebody I met lives in the country.

1169
01:45:13,371 --> 01:45:14,963
He sends me bread, too.

1170
01:45:15,072 --> 01:45:17,336
Fresh eggs? Bread?

1171
01:45:17,441 --> 01:45:20,308
He keeps me supplied.
I never lack for anything in my house.

1172
01:45:20,411 --> 01:45:22,777
Chickens, butter, fresh cheese.

1173
01:45:22,880 --> 01:45:25,508
- And potatoes?
- Potatoes, too.

1174
01:45:25,616 --> 01:45:28,107
If you come home with me,
I'll be happy to make you an omelet.

1175
01:45:28,219 --> 01:45:30,312
- What kind?
- A jelly omelet.

1176
01:45:30,755 --> 01:45:32,518
You must be tired
of eating cats all the time.

1177
01:45:32,623 --> 01:45:36,218
Yes. I ate too many of them.
And they're not so easy to find.

1178
01:45:36,327 --> 01:45:39,057
- What did you do?
- Ate mice.

1179
01:45:39,163 --> 01:45:40,824
There are more rats with the cats gone?

1180
01:45:40,932 --> 01:45:42,900
Yes, but they're all skin and bones.

1181
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:44,399
Listen. I don't live far from here.

1182
01:45:44,502 --> 01:45:47,096
Why don't you come
and have dinner with me?

1183
01:45:47,538 --> 01:45:49,665
- Is there a place to sleep?
- You can stay.

1184
01:45:49,774 --> 01:45:52,766
Nice shoes you have. Soft.

1185
01:45:53,144 --> 01:45:54,475
They were a present.

1186
01:45:54,578 --> 01:45:57,206
I got a present, too. A Siamese cat.

1187
01:45:57,315 --> 01:45:59,283
- Was he good?
- Too tough.

1188
01:46:00,217 --> 01:46:02,777
I have a pair of suede shoes.
You can have them.

1189
01:46:02,887 --> 01:46:06,618
And I have a nice oriental kimono.
Like Madame Butterfly's.

1190
01:46:06,757 --> 01:46:08,486
You know who Madame Butterfly is?

1191
01:46:08,592 --> 01:46:09,650
Lino!

1192
01:46:10,494 --> 01:46:14,692
- Is your name Lino? You!
- Me? Why?

1193
01:46:15,967 --> 01:46:18,595
You were a chauffeur, right?

1194
01:46:19,103 --> 01:46:22,698
- But a long time ago.
- Yes.

1195
01:46:27,311 --> 01:46:32,146
- You had a pistol.
- I? I don't understand you.

1196
01:46:33,684 --> 01:46:35,549
And you're alive still.

1197
01:46:36,187 --> 01:46:38,587
But I don't know you.
What do you want of me?

1198
01:46:38,689 --> 01:46:40,316
What's that scar?

1199
01:46:41,092 --> 01:46:43,185
- There was an accident.
- What accident?

1200
01:46:43,294 --> 01:46:44,818
What do you want?
Take your hands off me!

1201
01:46:44,929 --> 01:46:46,191
Where were you?

1202
01:46:46,297 --> 01:46:48,891
What were you doing
on March 25, 1917?

1203
01:46:49,333 --> 01:46:51,767
Me? I... Who are you?
You must be crazy.

1204
01:46:51,869 --> 01:46:54,667
What were you doing
on March 25, 1917?

1205
01:46:54,772 --> 01:46:56,171
Let me alone!

1206
01:46:56,273 --> 01:46:58,434
And the 15th of October, 1938.

1207
01:46:58,542 --> 01:47:00,669
Where were you?
What were you doing?

1208
01:47:01,479 --> 01:47:05,745
What were you doing at 4:00 p.m.
On October 15th, 1938?

1209
01:47:05,850 --> 01:47:07,841
Where were you?
What were you doing?

1210
01:47:07,952 --> 01:47:11,388
What were you doing? I've got to know.

1211
01:47:12,957 --> 01:47:16,188
Murderer! Murderer!

1212
01:47:18,329 --> 01:47:22,095
He killed a man, a political exile,

1213
01:47:22,933 --> 01:47:25,925
on October 15th, 1938!

1214
01:47:26,303 --> 01:47:28,168
Yes, Professor Quadri!

1215
01:47:28,506 --> 01:47:29,905
Luca Quadri!

1216
01:47:30,674 --> 01:47:33,404
And his wife Anna Quadri.

1217
01:47:36,781 --> 01:47:39,807
He's a homosexual, a Fascist!

1218
01:47:40,484 --> 01:47:42,577
And his name is Pasqualino!

1219
01:47:44,288 --> 01:47:45,619
Semirama!

1220
01:47:46,524 --> 01:47:48,583
Pasqualino Semirama!

1221
01:47:48,859 --> 01:47:53,125
Marcello, don't do that.

1222
01:47:56,100 --> 01:47:58,068
Marcello, where are you?

1223
01:47:59,336 --> 01:48:01,702
- Fascist!
- No, Marcello!

1224
01:48:01,806 --> 01:48:04,934
He, too, is a Fascist. Right here.

1225
01:48:05,042 --> 01:48:06,907
- What are you doing this for?
- This one's a Fascist.

1226
01:48:07,011 --> 01:48:10,777
Marcello, no. No, Marcello, please.

1227
01:48:10,881 --> 01:48:12,940
Marcello, no, no, Marcello!

1228
01:48:13,984 --> 01:48:17,010
Italo Montanari! Fascist!

1229
01:48:17,121 --> 01:48:18,952
No, Marcello. Are you crazy?

1230
01:48:19,056 --> 01:48:22,753
Marcello, why are you doing this?
Please, come back here.

1231
01:48:24,695 --> 01:48:27,528
Marcello. Marcello!

1232
01:48:28,966 --> 01:48:32,231
Marcello! Marcello!
