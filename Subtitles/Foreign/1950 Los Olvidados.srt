LOS OLVIDADOS

2
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:25,669
<i>This film is based on real events.
No character is fictional.</i>

3
00:01:45,529 --> 00:01:50,026
<i>Almost every capital
like New York, Paris, London</i>

4
00:01:50,242 --> 00:01:53,161
<i>hides, behind its wealth,
poverty-stricken homes</i>

5
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:57,535
<i>where poorly-fed children,
deprived of health or schooling,</i>

6
00:01:57,875 --> 00:02:00,283
<i>are doomed to criminality.</i>

7
00:02:00,502 --> 00:02:02,710
<i>Society tries to provide a cure.</i>

8
00:02:02,922 --> 00:02:05,710
<i>Success for its efforts
remains very limited.</i>

9
00:02:05,925 --> 00:02:08,251
<i>The future isn't shackled
to the present:</i>

10
00:02:08,469 --> 00:02:12,847
<i>The day will come when the rights
of childre are respected.</i>

11
00:02:13,432 --> 00:02:18,593
<i>Mexico City, a large modern city,
is no exception to the rule.</i>

12
00:02:18,812 --> 00:02:23,060
<i>This film shows life as it is.
It's not optimistic.</i>

13
00:02:23,275 --> 00:02:27,819
<i>The solution to this problem has
been left to the forces of progress.</i>

14
00:02:53,305 --> 00:02:55,880
Leave a bit for the others!

15
00:02:59,228 --> 00:03:01,138
Who wants a smoke?

16
00:03:09,029 --> 00:03:09,944
Do you smoke?

17
00:03:10,155 --> 00:03:12,694
No, it makes me cough.

18
00:03:14,535 --> 00:03:15,781
I don't smoke either.

19
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:17,703
What a chicken!

20
00:03:17,913 --> 00:03:18,614
You're a wimp!

21
00:03:18,831 --> 00:03:20,575
I have to go to work.

22
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:22,536
Only morons work.

23
00:03:22,751 --> 00:03:24,745
Too bad. See you later.

24
00:03:24,962 --> 00:03:26,042
You're so polite!

25
00:03:26,255 --> 00:03:28,213
Just a minute!
You know who I've seen?

26
00:03:28,966 --> 00:03:30,081
Jaïbo!

27
00:03:30,843 --> 00:03:32,587
He got away from
the reformatory prison.

28
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:35,047
Who's this Jaïbo?

29
00:03:38,892 --> 00:03:43,935
Egg tortillas.
Who wants tortillas?

30
00:03:55,993 --> 00:03:57,951
- One tortilla.
- Coming right up.

31
00:03:59,204 --> 00:04:00,830
Do you want it with pickles?

32
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,784
Put in anything you want.

33
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:27,980
As I was telling you,

34
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:33,312
in prison, if you're a wimp,
they beat the shit out of you.

35
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:34,278
Are there tough guys there?

36
00:04:34,531 --> 00:04:37,154
Yes, but if you're
tougher than them,

37
00:04:37,367 --> 00:04:39,694
they respect you.

38
00:04:40,204 --> 00:04:41,865
So they don't bother you.

39
00:04:42,247 --> 00:04:44,241
How's the grub?

40
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:48,451
Not bad.
And I took the best bed.

41
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:50,545
But the street is better.

42
00:04:50,756 --> 00:04:55,300
That's why I got away
as soon as I had the chance.

43
00:04:55,719 --> 00:04:58,757
Weren't you scared?
What if they'd caught you...

44
00:04:58,972 --> 00:05:02,425
Jaïbo doesn't fear anyone.

45
00:05:02,768 --> 00:05:05,224
It was Julian's fault
they put you in jail, right?

46
00:05:05,604 --> 00:05:08,606
It was. That bloody weasel...

47
00:05:09,066 --> 00:05:11,024
- Who can give me a cigarette?
- Not me.

48
00:05:11,235 --> 00:05:12,778
- Me neither.
- What about you?

49
00:05:12,986 --> 00:05:14,731
I've got no more.

50
00:05:14,947 --> 00:05:16,905
No cigarette, no dough!

51
00:05:17,491 --> 00:05:19,319
Without me, you're no good.

52
00:05:19,535 --> 00:05:21,943
But I've learned a lot

53
00:05:22,162 --> 00:05:24,488
and if you obey me
we'll all get dough.

54
00:05:24,706 --> 00:05:26,036
You're a real tough-guy.

55
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,911
We'll do everything you want.

56
00:06:06,081 --> 00:06:08,454
I'll sing you a song

57
00:06:08,667 --> 00:06:12,167
from the time of
General Don Porfirio.

58
00:06:15,382 --> 00:06:17,257
You can laugh,
but in these days

59
00:06:17,467 --> 00:06:21,217
people were more respectful
and women stayed at home.

60
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:24,716
Now they only think
of chasing men.

61
00:06:28,812 --> 00:06:32,941
This song will cost one peso.

62
00:06:33,483 --> 00:06:36,651
I have to sing to live.

63
00:06:36,862 --> 00:06:40,279
The price of bread is going up,
and so is the price of my songs.

64
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:44,572
This one is from the days of
General Don Porfirio.

65
00:06:47,497 --> 00:06:50,665
A 20 centavo coin and a 10
centavo have just dropped down.

66
00:06:54,087 --> 00:06:56,046
- Here's the blind man.
- Fine.

67
00:06:57,883 --> 00:07:00,173
You, Baldie,
you swipe his bag.

68
00:07:00,385 --> 00:07:04,384
Rush back and give it to him,
and he'll pass it on to me.

69
00:07:04,598 --> 00:07:06,805
You guys, you wait
where I told you.

70
00:07:07,017 --> 00:07:08,097
What if I'm arrested?

71
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:10,185
Just drop the 'exhibit'.

72
00:07:10,395 --> 00:07:14,608
Don't get nabbed with it!

73
00:07:15,609 --> 00:07:17,401
I know the law!

74
00:07:17,611 --> 00:07:19,236
- Move!
- It's OK.

75
00:07:24,493 --> 00:07:26,118
- What do you want?
- Nothing.

76
00:07:26,328 --> 00:07:28,322
Leave me alone then.

77
00:07:46,765 --> 00:07:48,723
Keep away, son.

78
00:07:48,934 --> 00:07:51,342
Go and tickle the bull's nostril.

79
00:08:36,273 --> 00:08:37,851
Did he hit you hard?

80
00:08:38,859 --> 00:08:40,484
He only scratched me.

81
00:08:42,863 --> 00:08:44,144
What an arsehole!

82
00:08:44,364 --> 00:08:45,741
There was a nail
on the end of the stick.

83
00:08:45,949 --> 00:08:47,195
It's deep!

84
00:08:47,409 --> 00:08:49,735
Ask your mother to nurse you.

85
00:08:49,953 --> 00:08:53,038
My mother? If I go home,
she'll kill me.

86
00:08:53,248 --> 00:08:55,917
Mine's horrible too.
That's why I left.

87
00:09:03,467 --> 00:09:06,469
Gashes from a nail are bad.

88
00:09:06,678 --> 00:09:09,929
Put a cobweb on it. It's good
for stopping bleeding.

89
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,516
Pedro! Bring me one.

90
00:09:11,725 --> 00:09:14,347
- I will.
- Hurry up!

91
00:09:14,811 --> 00:09:17,184
With that, you get over it
or you lose your paw.

92
00:09:24,821 --> 00:09:28,737
Is there a kind soul
who can help me cross?

93
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:31,775
Who will take pity
of a poor blind man?

94
00:09:31,995 --> 00:09:34,701
Is there anybody?

95
00:09:35,957 --> 00:09:37,785
Why are you crying, my child?

96
00:09:38,085 --> 00:09:41,786
My Dad told me to wait here
and he hasn't come back.

97
00:09:42,005 --> 00:09:46,253
He won't be long. Tell you what:
you can help me, since I'm blind.

98
00:09:46,468 --> 00:09:48,426
You do have small eyes.

99
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:01,805
The less of us there are,
the better. You guys, wait.

100
00:10:02,025 --> 00:10:04,315
We'll thank him all right.

101
00:10:45,373 --> 00:10:49,422
Have some pity for a poor
defenceless blind man.

102
00:10:49,755 --> 00:10:51,167
Take that, you bloody blind man!

103
00:10:59,807 --> 00:11:02,513
In the head, Baldie,
in the head!

104
00:11:27,256 --> 00:11:28,917
Watch out, or you
gonna break your neck.

105
00:11:51,557 --> 00:11:52,803
What are we getting to eat?

106
00:11:55,728 --> 00:11:57,852
- What is it?
- Nothing.

107
00:11:58,606 --> 00:12:00,481
- Cool, some meat!
- Don't touch it.

108
00:12:00,691 --> 00:12:04,108
You've been given meat?
That's impossible!

109
00:12:10,201 --> 00:12:11,400
Don't touch it!

110
00:12:19,168 --> 00:12:22,419
Where the hell have you been?

111
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:24,505
Over there... Looking for a job.

112
00:12:24,715 --> 00:12:27,717
All night long?
Why have you come back?

113
00:12:27,927 --> 00:12:29,552
Mum, I'm hungry.

114
00:12:29,762 --> 00:12:33,808
I've told you not to come back
if you hang with these punks.

115
00:12:34,016 --> 00:12:35,809
You don't realise
I work myself to death

116
00:12:36,018 --> 00:12:38,059
washing floors all day long.

117
00:12:41,857 --> 00:12:42,688
I'm hungry!

118
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:45,190
Ask your friends to feed you.

119
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:46,901
Punk!

120
00:12:54,245 --> 00:12:56,120
Why are you hitting me?

121
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:58,158
To teach you a lesson,
you good-for-nothing!

122
00:12:58,374 --> 00:12:59,324
You don't love me any more.

123
00:12:59,542 --> 00:13:02,579
It's your fault.

124
00:13:36,418 --> 00:13:37,914
It was good!

125
00:13:43,533 --> 00:13:44,862
You're not from here, are you?

126
00:13:45,076 --> 00:13:47,117
Yes... from the country.

127
00:13:47,328 --> 00:13:50,200
If you're a peasant,
you're not from here!

128
00:13:50,415 --> 00:13:51,910
Why did you come here?

129
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:54,165
I didn't come,
I was brought.

130
00:13:54,377 --> 00:13:55,327
Why?

131
00:13:55,545 --> 00:13:56,376
I don't know.

132
00:13:56,588 --> 00:13:58,332
You know nothing!

133
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:01,881
Hi, Pedro!

134
00:14:02,093 --> 00:14:03,209
Hi, Julian!

135
00:14:03,428 --> 00:14:05,967
Have you seen my father?

136
00:14:09,258 --> 00:14:11,003
I know where he is...

137
00:14:14,597 --> 00:14:15,796
What a prick!

138
00:14:16,724 --> 00:14:18,848
Now I'm hungrier than before.

139
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,306
Have you eaten?

140
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,386
No.

141
00:14:21,604 --> 00:14:24,143
- Are you hungry?
- A lot.

142
00:14:24,357 --> 00:14:25,982
Have you got any money?

143
00:14:36,411 --> 00:14:38,120
Come on, Dad.
You can't stand up any more.

144
00:14:38,329 --> 00:14:40,204
No. Let me go.

145
00:14:40,415 --> 00:14:42,823
You ought to be ashamed.

146
00:14:43,042 --> 00:14:46,412
You shouldn't judge your father.

147
00:14:46,629 --> 00:14:49,417
I'm not judging you, but
you could get beaten up.

148
00:14:49,632 --> 00:14:52,301
- Mum's waiting.
- Let her wait!

149
00:14:58,933 --> 00:15:01,852
Don't you get sick of
being drunk every night?

150
00:15:02,061 --> 00:15:03,177
Me, drunk?

151
00:15:04,564 --> 00:15:07,103
Yes, it's true.

152
00:15:08,609 --> 00:15:10,188
What a shame!

153
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:15,324
You work yourself to death
to feed us and I...

154
00:15:15,908 --> 00:15:20,121
Forgive me, son.
I swear I'll stop drinking.

155
00:15:20,329 --> 00:15:21,529
You always say that.

156
00:15:21,748 --> 00:15:22,947
This time, it's true.

157
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:25,408
He's so drunk!

158
00:15:25,626 --> 00:15:26,956
Do you have a problem
with that?

159
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:29,210
No. Sorry.

160
00:15:32,393 --> 00:15:34,719
Your lack of respect
gets on my nerves

161
00:15:34,937 --> 00:15:36,053
Here we go again!

162
00:15:36,355 --> 00:15:38,562
I'm your father after all!

163
00:15:40,025 --> 00:15:42,149
What a drunkard!

164
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:48,317
OK... I'm leaving. Bye.

165
00:16:24,403 --> 00:16:26,527
Give me that knife over there.

166
00:16:26,739 --> 00:16:28,317
I'm busy.

167
00:16:39,126 --> 00:16:43,125
Here, I count for less than
an animal. Where's Metche?

168
00:16:43,339 --> 00:16:46,756
Where are you?
I'm going to die alone!

169
00:16:46,967 --> 00:16:50,586
Go find your sister so she can
give her a rub-down.

170
00:16:50,804 --> 00:16:51,671
She'll come back.

171
00:16:57,811 --> 00:16:59,057
It's me, Jaïbo.

172
00:16:59,271 --> 00:17:02,273
My fool of a brother
is forever bringing us tramps.

173
00:17:02,483 --> 00:17:05,152
Hang on. We need to talk.

174
00:17:06,695 --> 00:17:08,404
Aren't you supposed
to be in jail?

175
00:17:08,614 --> 00:17:11,153
I am whereever I want to be.
I've escaped.

176
00:17:11,367 --> 00:17:15,235
Get lost! If they find you here,
it'll be bad for us.

177
00:17:15,454 --> 00:17:17,198
- Want some help?
- No!

178
00:17:17,414 --> 00:17:20,037
You've become so pretty
since the last time I saw you.

179
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,496
You keep quiet or I'll scream!

180
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:23,253
OK! Don't get mad at me.

181
00:17:25,297 --> 00:17:26,377
I'm going out.

182
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:31,134
Lie down or you'll cough
and stop us from sleeping.

183
00:17:36,266 --> 00:17:37,548
Pimples!

184
00:17:37,851 --> 00:17:38,682
What?

185
00:17:38,894 --> 00:17:41,730
I've fought with Mum,
I've come to sleep here.

186
00:17:41,939 --> 00:17:42,805
Who's this?

187
00:17:43,023 --> 00:17:44,768
He was lost,
I took pity on him.

188
00:17:44,984 --> 00:17:47,061
Come in but don't make any noise.

189
00:17:52,491 --> 00:17:54,319
Mum's waiting for you.

190
00:17:55,244 --> 00:17:56,324
Hi, Jaïbo!

191
00:17:56,537 --> 00:17:59,907
Pedro! It's getting to be
quite a crowd here!

192
00:18:01,959 --> 00:18:03,502
Who's the guy
with the small eyes?

193
00:18:03,711 --> 00:18:07,544
Well... He's called Small Eyes.
I found him at the market.

194
00:18:08,549 --> 00:18:10,542
- Can you see me?
- Me? No.

195
00:18:12,469 --> 00:18:14,593
Why did you bring him?
Beat it!

196
00:18:14,805 --> 00:18:16,633
Leave him alone!

197
00:18:16,849 --> 00:18:18,048
Don't you have any family?

198
00:18:18,267 --> 00:18:19,928
He could be a bastard.

199
00:18:20,144 --> 00:18:21,390
I have a Dad!

200
00:18:21,603 --> 00:18:22,518
So where is he?

201
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:26,645
He told me to wait for him,
but he didn't come back.

202
00:18:26,859 --> 00:18:27,559
He's not from here.

203
00:18:27,776 --> 00:18:28,726
We have to go.

204
00:18:28,944 --> 00:18:32,231
Don't touch the animals
and don't make any noise.

205
00:18:32,948 --> 00:18:34,858
Good night, Metche.

206
00:18:35,075 --> 00:18:38,576
When I get rich,
I'm going to marry you.

207
00:18:38,996 --> 00:18:41,036
Don't worry about the chickens!

208
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:44,746
He said not to touch the animals,

209
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,915
when it's so good to have
some milk before bed!

210
00:18:55,012 --> 00:18:58,927
They haven't left a drop!

211
00:18:59,308 --> 00:19:00,637
Look at him!

212
00:19:08,308 --> 00:19:11,927
Leave us alone.
Pedro and I, we're leaving.

213
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,850
- Gimme your handkerchief.
- Why?

214
00:19:14,063 --> 00:19:14,894
I'll give it back to you.

215
00:19:15,106 --> 00:19:17,563
- My throat's hurting.
- Don't piss me off.

216
00:19:17,775 --> 00:19:20,694
You, follow me.
You guys, see you later.

217
00:19:25,558 --> 00:19:26,970
What about Julian?

218
00:19:28,311 --> 00:19:30,388
- I saw him last night.
- Is he always at the same place?

219
00:19:30,605 --> 00:19:32,682
No. He works on a building site.

220
00:19:32,899 --> 00:19:33,682
Where?

221
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,443
I'll show you if you want.

222
00:19:37,153 --> 00:19:38,565
Let's go and talk to him.

223
00:19:41,783 --> 00:19:42,697
There he is.

224
00:19:42,909 --> 00:19:45,318
Tell him I'm here.

225
00:19:45,537 --> 00:19:47,281
Be careful,
he packs a hard punch.

226
00:19:47,497 --> 00:19:49,455
Since he doesn't smoke,
he never runs out of breath.

227
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:50,746
Get moving!

228
00:20:05,098 --> 00:20:06,379
Jaïbo wants to see you.

229
00:20:07,225 --> 00:20:08,601
Why?

230
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:10,638
To talk to you.

231
00:20:10,854 --> 00:20:12,681
If he's looking for a fight,
he'll get what he's after.

232
00:20:12,897 --> 00:20:15,734
- He wants to know if you wimped out.
- He'll find out about that.

233
00:20:17,736 --> 00:20:20,109
- I'll be back right away.
- Don't be too long.

234
00:20:20,321 --> 00:20:22,611
- Just a minute.
- Go on.

235
00:20:27,912 --> 00:20:28,779
What do you want?

236
00:20:28,997 --> 00:20:30,540
I haven't seen you
in a while!

237
00:20:30,749 --> 00:20:32,541
Why did you want to meet me?

238
00:20:32,751 --> 00:20:35,503
I have to talk to you...
but not here.

239
00:20:35,712 --> 00:20:36,709
Wherever you want.

240
00:20:36,921 --> 00:20:38,002
Let's go.

241
00:20:44,345 --> 00:20:46,469
We've walked enough.
Now talk!

242
00:20:46,681 --> 00:20:49,884
I've spent a year in jail
thanks to you, if you recall.

243
00:20:50,185 --> 00:20:51,596
- Thanks to me?
- Sure!

244
00:20:51,811 --> 00:20:53,271
You squealed on me.

245
00:20:53,605 --> 00:20:56,975
If it was me, I'd tell you.
You don't scare me.

246
00:20:57,192 --> 00:20:58,307
I'm not a rat.

247
00:20:58,693 --> 00:21:01,565
The guy who squealed on me
is going to pay for it.

248
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:06,324
You're bluffing. You know I can't
beat you up because of your arm.

249
00:21:06,534 --> 00:21:10,485
Come back when you're better
and you'll see what you get.

250
00:21:10,705 --> 00:21:13,541
As for you, I'm going to
beat the shit out of you.

251
00:21:29,182 --> 00:21:31,970
Stop hitting him!

252
00:21:49,654 --> 00:21:53,818
Let's get out of here before
he wakes up. That'll show him.

253
00:21:54,074 --> 00:21:56,068
That's for you.

254
00:21:56,285 --> 00:21:58,492
When he comes to,
he won't miss us.

255
00:21:58,704 --> 00:22:00,745
When he comes to,
I'll put him back to sleep.

256
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:07,442
Please, I'd like to cross over.

257
00:22:08,282 --> 00:22:11,699
Can no-one hear
a poor blind man?

258
00:22:11,911 --> 00:22:13,655
I'll help you, sir.

259
00:22:13,871 --> 00:22:17,074
Hang on! It's you from yesterday.
Are you still waiting for your father?

260
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:17,957
Yes, sir.

261
00:22:18,167 --> 00:22:22,118
For sure he's not coming back.

262
00:22:22,338 --> 00:22:25,708
There's too much poverty these days,
too many mouths to feed.

263
00:22:26,384 --> 00:22:29,754
Listen, son, I need
someone to help me.

264
00:22:29,971 --> 00:22:32,973
Come with me, you'll have a home
and something to eat.

265
00:22:33,182 --> 00:22:34,049
What about my Dad?

266
00:22:34,267 --> 00:22:38,645
We'll come back here every day.
Go on, take that.

267
00:22:39,814 --> 00:22:45,022
If the police question you,
I'm your godfather. Let's go.

268
00:22:48,457 --> 00:22:50,367
Come in, Don Carmelo.

269
00:22:50,584 --> 00:22:52,459
Small Eyes, what are
you doing with him?

270
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:56,964
Are you called Small Eyes?
What a stupid name!

271
00:23:00,094 --> 00:23:01,637
Wait for me here.

272
00:23:06,848 --> 00:23:08,260
Hi!

273
00:23:09,351 --> 00:23:11,095
How does the patient feel?

274
00:23:11,311 --> 00:23:15,226
Better... but I've been left
on my own.

275
00:23:15,565 --> 00:23:18,235
But your sons are grown-up now.

276
00:23:18,443 --> 00:23:23,190
They're just hooligans,
always lounging around.

277
00:23:23,573 --> 00:23:27,786
I know.
There's nothing to do here.

278
00:23:27,994 --> 00:23:29,953
Turn around, please.

279
00:23:31,998 --> 00:23:36,542
Mother Mary!
Have pity on me and heal me!

280
00:23:39,297 --> 00:23:42,216
It's working!
Look at the pigeon.

281
00:23:42,425 --> 00:23:45,048
You've infected it
with your disease.

282
00:23:45,262 --> 00:23:48,299
When it dies, you'll be cured.

283
00:23:48,515 --> 00:23:51,137
Holy Mary, mother of God!

284
00:23:51,351 --> 00:23:54,104
I can't bear this pain any more.

285
00:24:06,575 --> 00:24:07,951
What's my boss doing inside there?

286
00:24:09,161 --> 00:24:10,786
It's for my sick mother.

287
00:24:10,996 --> 00:24:14,864
Don Carmelo is treating her
with a pigeon.

288
00:24:15,292 --> 00:24:17,001
That's not a good thing to do.

289
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:19,667
How do you know?

290
00:24:24,467 --> 00:24:25,500
Look.

291
00:24:26,178 --> 00:24:27,377
What is it?

292
00:24:27,596 --> 00:24:29,055
It's the tooth of a dead man.

293
00:24:29,264 --> 00:24:32,883
It keeps the Evil Eye away.
Whoever has it never gets sick.

294
00:24:33,101 --> 00:24:34,217
Where did you find it?

295
00:24:34,978 --> 00:24:39,392
At the graveyard.
I took it by moonlight.

296
00:24:39,608 --> 00:24:41,435
Otherwise, it's worthless.

297
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:43,226
If you like, I'll give it to you.

298
00:24:44,988 --> 00:24:46,317
To me?

299
00:24:47,532 --> 00:24:48,612
Take it.

300
00:24:51,912 --> 00:24:53,158
Thanks.

301
00:24:54,664 --> 00:24:57,999
So, get well.

302
00:24:58,752 --> 00:25:00,164
Metche, my bottle!

303
00:25:00,378 --> 00:25:02,171
There you go, Don Carmelo.

304
00:25:03,131 --> 00:25:05,800
From now on, Small Eyes
will come and get it.

305
00:25:06,009 --> 00:25:07,967
- Do you hear me?
- Yes, sir.

306
00:25:08,178 --> 00:25:09,258
Let's head off.

307
00:25:17,479 --> 00:25:20,896
For health, nothing beats donkey milk.

308
00:25:30,615 --> 00:25:32,194
Would you have a cigarette?

309
00:25:32,409 --> 00:25:34,284
I don't like to encourage slackers.

310
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,329
Go and keep watch.

311
00:25:42,711 --> 00:25:43,411
What do you want?

312
00:25:43,628 --> 00:25:45,040
A cigarette.

313
00:25:45,255 --> 00:25:47,664
- Go and buy one.
- We don't have any money.

314
00:25:47,883 --> 00:25:50,801
Get a job, and you'll
be able to smoke.

315
00:25:54,639 --> 00:25:55,387
Police!

316
00:25:55,599 --> 00:25:57,094
Let's shut his trap for him.

317
00:25:57,559 --> 00:25:58,935
Police!

318
00:25:59,394 --> 00:26:00,510
He's about to find out
who he's dealing with!

319
00:26:04,468 --> 00:26:05,100
Great!

320
00:26:05,734 --> 00:26:06,980
Let him go.

321
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,939
Now, let's all scram!

322
00:26:37,182 --> 00:26:38,132
Take it!

323
00:26:38,391 --> 00:26:39,970
There's one peso for each of you.

324
00:26:42,979 --> 00:26:44,474
And we're not finished.

325
00:26:44,689 --> 00:26:48,818
I'm rusty.
You haven't seen anything yet.

326
00:26:51,738 --> 00:26:54,195
That cripple was
really scared to death.

327
00:26:54,741 --> 00:26:55,987
Hey guys!

328
00:26:56,785 --> 00:27:00,119
I've been looking for you.
Have you heard what happened?

329
00:27:03,083 --> 00:27:04,412
Julian's been found dead.

330
00:27:05,043 --> 00:27:06,918
- You're kidding!
- Julian?

331
00:27:07,587 --> 00:27:10,257
Not far from where he works.

332
00:27:10,999 --> 00:27:12,742
His body's still lying there.
There are lots of people around.

333
00:27:13,125 --> 00:27:13,872
Do they know who did it?

334
00:27:14,084 --> 00:27:16,956
The police say
he was killed from behind.

335
00:27:17,171 --> 00:27:18,167
Are we gonna go and have a look?

336
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:19,412
Let's do it.

337
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,708
- Come with us, Pedro.
- We're heading there.

338
00:27:23,868 --> 00:27:25,577
- What's the mattern?
- Nothing!

339
00:27:25,787 --> 00:27:27,780
You go now , and we'll follow.

340
00:27:28,498 --> 00:27:29,744
Come soon!

341
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:45,640
It was you who killed him!

342
00:27:45,849 --> 00:27:47,178
I didn't want to.

343
00:27:48,059 --> 00:27:49,768
You'd better
keep your mouth shut now

344
00:27:49,978 --> 00:27:52,102
if you don't want
us to be arrested.

345
00:27:52,313 --> 00:27:53,773
I didn't do anything.

346
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:58,391
You were looking for him.
You took half of his dough.

347
00:27:58,611 --> 00:28:02,480
If we get nabbed, I'll end up
in jail, and so will you.

348
00:28:04,576 --> 00:28:05,739
So what do we do now?

349
00:28:06,661 --> 00:28:09,153
We have to split up.

350
00:28:09,372 --> 00:28:12,041
If they catch one of us,
we keep our mouths shut, OK?

351
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:13,200
OK.

352
00:28:14,377 --> 00:28:18,210
Now we have to rely on each other
more than ever, is that clear?

353
00:29:44,801 --> 00:29:46,841
<i>Pedro darling, what are you doing?</i>

354
00:30:20,962 --> 00:30:23,205
<i>Listen to me, sweetheart,
you're not that bad.</i>

355
00:30:23,423 --> 00:30:25,048
<i>Why did you do it?</i>

356
00:30:26,301 --> 00:30:30,086
<i>I didn't do anything. It was Jaïbo.</i>

357
00:30:30,555 --> 00:30:33,972
<i>I'd like to be
with you all the time.</i>

358
00:30:34,684 --> 00:30:36,678
<i>But I'm very tired.</i>

359
00:30:36,894 --> 00:30:40,015
<i>Look at my hands, they're
worn-out from doing washing.</i>

360
00:30:40,982 --> 00:30:42,726
<i>Why don't you ever kiss me?</i>

361
00:30:42,942 --> 00:30:45,648
<i>Mum, I'm gonna behave.</i>

362
00:30:45,862 --> 00:30:48,947
<i>I'll look for a job,
you'll be able to rest.</i>

363
00:30:50,033 --> 00:30:51,658
<i>Yes, darling.</i>

364
00:31:08,176 --> 00:31:09,256
<i>Mummy...</i>

365
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:14,349
<i>Why didn't you give me
some meat the other night?</i>

366
00:31:52,178 --> 00:31:56,093
<i>Give it to me!
It's mine.</i>

367
00:32:49,193 --> 00:32:51,436
APPRENTICE WANTED

368
00:33:17,868 --> 00:33:18,703
What are you looking at?

369
00:33:18,915 --> 00:33:22,332
Milk... There's nothing better
for the skin.

370
00:33:22,543 --> 00:33:23,291
What?

371
00:33:23,503 --> 00:33:26,955
If you wash with it,
people say your skin

372
00:33:27,173 --> 00:33:28,633
becomes like satin.

373
00:33:28,841 --> 00:33:31,416
Bloody Small Eyes!
You seem to know everything.

374
00:33:31,844 --> 00:33:34,301
It's 'cause my mother used
to do the hair of girls

375
00:33:34,514 --> 00:33:36,342
who were getting married,
and treat their skin with milk.

376
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:39,473
OK... see you tomorrow.

377
00:33:39,894 --> 00:33:41,437
Is what you told me true?

378
00:34:12,343 --> 00:34:14,136
Jaïbo!
Haven't you left yet?

379
00:34:14,345 --> 00:34:15,544
I'm not going
while you're still around.

380
00:34:15,763 --> 00:34:18,255
- If Grandpa knows it...
- I don't give a shit.

381
00:34:18,474 --> 00:34:20,931
- Hey, where are you going?
- What do you want?

382
00:34:21,144 --> 00:34:22,722
- To see you.
- Get lost!

383
00:34:22,937 --> 00:34:24,397
Stick around, I'm not going
to eat you.

384
00:34:24,605 --> 00:34:27,098
Don't come near me
or you'll get thumped.

385
00:34:27,317 --> 00:34:29,394
If you give me a kiss,
I'll give you...

386
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:30,607
What?

387
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:33,359
Two pesos to buy
whatever you want.

388
00:34:33,573 --> 00:34:34,688
Show me.

389
00:34:37,285 --> 00:34:38,448
Have a look.

390
00:34:40,371 --> 00:34:41,783
Just one, OK?

391
00:34:44,792 --> 00:34:47,747
Leave me alone, don't touch me!
Stop that!

392
00:34:55,928 --> 00:34:57,044
What's going on?

393
00:34:57,263 --> 00:34:58,924
Jaïbo's having fun with my sister.

394
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:02,058
Let go of me, you animal!

395
00:35:05,146 --> 00:35:06,427
Don't do anything.

396
00:35:06,939 --> 00:35:08,020
Let me go!

397
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:11,893
You dirty pig, take that!

398
00:35:12,111 --> 00:35:13,904
You'll see,
I'm going to tell Mum.

399
00:35:14,113 --> 00:35:14,896
Are you gonna shut up?

400
00:35:15,114 --> 00:35:18,567
There's no need to make such
a big fuss about nothing.

401
00:35:20,453 --> 00:35:24,452
If you'd have touched me,
I would have smashed your face in.

402
00:35:24,665 --> 00:35:27,371
Let him go,
people can hear you.

403
00:35:27,585 --> 00:35:29,958
You big coward, how dare you
behave like that with him!

404
00:35:30,171 --> 00:35:31,750
Come with me.

405
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:35,757
Let's go, Grandpa
might be able to hear us.

406
00:35:35,968 --> 00:35:38,045
He's not so deaf as all that.

407
00:35:46,771 --> 00:35:48,729
See you tomorrow, Small Eyes.

408
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,843
Why are you looking at me?

409
00:36:05,056 --> 00:36:05,804
No reason.

410
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:07,677
What's the matter?

411
00:36:10,562 --> 00:36:12,971
- Is it true that you...
- What?

412
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:14,685
Killed Julian?

413
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,099
I didn't do anything.

414
00:36:16,318 --> 00:36:18,525
I thought so.

415
00:36:18,737 --> 00:36:21,940
- Just watch what you say...
- Don't worry, I'm your mate.

416
00:36:22,157 --> 00:36:24,910
If you did it,
that's your business.

417
00:36:26,369 --> 00:36:29,490
What are you doing here?
Who's he?

418
00:36:29,706 --> 00:36:32,909
A pal who's helping me.
Do you have a problem with that?

419
00:36:33,126 --> 00:36:36,294
I don't want to see anyone here.

420
00:36:36,505 --> 00:36:38,130
Don't get mad, Grandpa.

421
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:41,176
If he leaves, I'm leaving too.

422
00:36:41,384 --> 00:36:42,844
Right, clear off!

423
00:36:43,053 --> 00:36:44,429
Let's scram!

424
00:36:52,145 --> 00:36:54,222
What will you do?

425
00:36:54,439 --> 00:36:56,231
I don't know.
I don't got any money.

426
00:36:56,441 --> 00:37:00,025
You'd better go into hiding for.
a few days. We'll come to see you.

427
00:37:00,529 --> 00:37:03,198
I know a great place.
I'll take you there.

428
00:37:03,406 --> 00:37:05,614
- Where is it?
- Come on.

429
00:38:07,554 --> 00:38:10,342
I've got you! What is it
you've come here for?

430
00:38:12,142 --> 00:38:15,144
Some water. I live with
a blind man in this house.

431
00:38:15,353 --> 00:38:17,228
If I wanted to,
I could knock you out.

432
00:38:17,439 --> 00:38:20,144
If you ever tell anyone
you saw me here, I'll kill you.

433
00:38:20,358 --> 00:38:21,189
Yes, sir.

434
00:38:21,401 --> 00:38:23,193
You know I keep my promises.

435
00:38:24,362 --> 00:38:25,359
Hang on a minute.

436
00:38:26,573 --> 00:38:29,242
Don't breathe a word!

437
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:40,750
Come here, Small Eyes.

438
00:38:43,882 --> 00:38:45,460
Who were you talking to?

439
00:38:45,675 --> 00:38:47,218
Just someone who was passing by.

440
00:38:47,427 --> 00:38:49,919
You're lying. Nobody ever
comes here.

441
00:38:50,138 --> 00:38:52,179
He was there, then he left.

442
00:38:53,683 --> 00:38:54,384
Who was it?

443
00:38:54,601 --> 00:38:55,882
I don't know!

444
00:38:56,102 --> 00:38:58,808
You'll tell me
or I'll tear off your ear.

445
00:38:59,022 --> 00:39:00,980
- Jaïbo.
- What?

446
00:39:01,191 --> 00:39:02,900
He's called Jaïbo.

447
00:39:06,196 --> 00:39:08,984
I forbid you to talk
to other people.

448
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:12,942
This Jaïbo for sure he's one
of those layabouts...

449
00:39:13,703 --> 00:39:18,200
If I see you with him or another
of them, I'll break your arm.

450
00:39:18,792 --> 00:39:22,126
These days, you all
keep bad company.

451
00:39:22,796 --> 00:39:25,548
Before, it used to be different.

452
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:28,546
Grown-ups

453
00:39:28,843 --> 00:39:31,680
were respected.

454
00:39:32,345 --> 00:39:34,340
What was that,
Small Eyes?

455
00:39:35,099 --> 00:39:36,476
Just a stone that fell down.

456
00:40:04,337 --> 00:40:05,453
Get lost!

457
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:13,261
Where's the scum
who killed my son?

458
00:40:13,471 --> 00:40:18,513
Show your face so that
I can kill you!

459
00:40:19,435 --> 00:40:22,223
He was attacked from behind!

460
00:40:22,438 --> 00:40:26,519
Somebody bring me that coward!

461
00:40:26,734 --> 00:40:29,357
Just be patient... Be patient!

462
00:40:54,262 --> 00:40:58,889
I've got a job! On Saturday,
I'll bring you seven pesos.

463
00:40:59,517 --> 00:41:01,178
Get me that bowl.

464
00:41:06,858 --> 00:41:10,607
From now on,
I'm going to behave.

465
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,530
See what happens with your
idiotic carry-on!

466
00:41:27,295 --> 00:41:29,039
You disgusting rooster!

467
00:41:37,930 --> 00:41:40,054
Stop! Stop hitting it!

468
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:19,040
Mind the shop. If anyone comes,
they can wait.

469
00:42:39,610 --> 00:42:40,441
What do you want?

470
00:42:40,653 --> 00:42:41,685
To talk to you.

471
00:42:42,321 --> 00:42:43,271
Not here!

472
00:42:43,489 --> 00:42:44,355
It's important.

473
00:42:44,573 --> 00:42:45,570
The boss will be back soon.

474
00:42:45,783 --> 00:42:48,619
So what? Just tell him
I'm a customer.

475
00:42:48,828 --> 00:42:50,738
The business with Julian
is starting to cause trouble.

476
00:42:50,955 --> 00:42:51,738
Do they know what happened?

477
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:53,371
No...

478
00:42:53,582 --> 00:42:56,501
But the police are questioning
everyone in the neighbourhood.

479
00:42:56,710 --> 00:43:00,330
Since you knew him, they'll
be coming to see you.

480
00:43:00,714 --> 00:43:02,423
They're searching for me
as an escapee.

481
00:43:03,217 --> 00:43:04,498
What will I tell them?

482
00:43:04,718 --> 00:43:08,088
It depends...
First, you should tell them...

483
00:43:08,305 --> 00:43:09,172
Scram! My boss is coming!

484
00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:10,802
- What should we do?
- I don't know.

485
00:43:11,016 --> 00:43:12,642
I'll come to your place tonight.

486
00:43:20,651 --> 00:43:22,479
- Did anyone come?
- No, sir.

487
00:43:22,695 --> 00:43:23,727
You can go.

488
00:43:35,833 --> 00:43:38,076
Have you seen
the silver-handled knife?

489
00:43:38,836 --> 00:43:39,868
It was there.

490
00:43:40,087 --> 00:43:41,547
It must have
fallen down somewhere.

491
00:43:53,059 --> 00:43:54,720
Go and get me some water.

492
00:43:54,936 --> 00:43:56,597
Take the jug.

493
00:43:58,439 --> 00:44:00,480
- Come on.
- Hurry up!

494
00:44:04,195 --> 00:44:05,358
Hello.

495
00:44:07,156 --> 00:44:08,188
Hello.
What do you want?

496
00:44:11,285 --> 00:44:13,528
- Is Pedro home?
- No, not yet.

497
00:44:13,746 --> 00:44:17,827
I'm supposed to meet him here.
If you don't mind, I'll wait.

498
00:44:18,042 --> 00:44:19,667
If you want to.

499
00:44:30,054 --> 00:44:32,427
It must be great
to have a mother!

500
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:35,595
When I look at you,
I envy Pedro.

501
00:44:40,022 --> 00:44:42,645
I don't even know
what my family name is.

502
00:44:42,858 --> 00:44:45,315
My father... I've never known
who he was.

503
00:44:46,112 --> 00:44:49,731
My mother died
when I was a kid.

504
00:44:51,033 --> 00:44:52,315
Do you remember her?

505
00:44:52,785 --> 00:44:56,784
No... just the once,
from when I was little.

506
00:44:56,998 --> 00:45:00,664
It seems I had these seizures...
like convulsions.

507
00:45:00,876 --> 00:45:02,751
Once, after a seizure,

508
00:45:02,962 --> 00:45:04,754
I saw the face of a woman,

509
00:45:05,172 --> 00:45:07,083
very close to me.

510
00:45:07,842 --> 00:45:10,381
She was looking at me tenderly,
with a sad expression.

511
00:45:10,594 --> 00:45:14,344
She was crying. That's why
I think she was my mother.

512
00:45:14,557 --> 00:45:15,756
And you remember that?

513
00:45:15,975 --> 00:45:19,060
Yes, because nobody ever
looked at me like that again.

514
00:45:24,859 --> 00:45:27,148
Maybe it was a dream.

515
00:45:27,486 --> 00:45:28,483
What did she look like?

516
00:45:29,117 --> 00:45:33,442
She looked like the Virgins
you see in church.

517
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:40,689
Mummy, a policeman's
asking after you!

518
00:45:40,905 --> 00:45:42,982
- For me?
- Yes, a cop.

519
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:45,323
- What does he want?
- I don't know.

520
00:46:06,555 --> 00:46:07,885
You'd better come inside.

521
00:46:31,733 --> 00:46:34,485
Do you know about my Julian?
They killed him.

522
00:46:34,694 --> 00:46:36,937
He liked you so much.

523
00:46:37,238 --> 00:46:40,525
My darling... he was so good...
What will become of us?

524
00:46:40,742 --> 00:46:44,194
He was working for us.
Who killed him?

525
00:46:44,412 --> 00:46:46,156
- What?
- You must know.

526
00:46:46,372 --> 00:46:47,452
I swear I don't know anything.

527
00:46:47,665 --> 00:46:49,825
- Yes, you do.
- No!

528
00:46:51,753 --> 00:46:54,292
Try to find out who killed
him and let me know,

529
00:46:54,505 --> 00:46:56,629
so that I can catch him and I...

530
00:46:56,841 --> 00:46:57,838
Pedro!

531
00:46:59,093 --> 00:47:00,470
Are you sure?

532
00:47:00,678 --> 00:47:02,968
Yes, your son was at the shop.

533
00:47:03,181 --> 00:47:04,510
He's the only one who could
have stolen the knife.

534
00:47:04,724 --> 00:47:06,184
My brother hasn't stolen anything.

535
00:47:06,392 --> 00:47:07,140
Shut up.

536
00:47:07,352 --> 00:47:08,467
Cigarette?

537
00:47:10,188 --> 00:47:12,098
I don't know what to do
with that boy.

538
00:47:12,315 --> 00:47:15,732
He stays out all night, I never
know where he spends the day,

539
00:47:15,943 --> 00:47:16,810
and now...

540
00:47:17,028 --> 00:47:19,484
It's serious. If he's convicted
of the theft, he'll go to jail.

541
00:47:19,697 --> 00:47:22,106
Good, it doesn't worry me.

542
00:47:22,325 --> 00:47:24,946
When he gets back, take him away
and give him a good thrashing.

543
00:47:25,688 --> 00:47:27,571
Thrash him
until he's learned his lesson.

544
00:49:25,364 --> 00:49:26,990
You, beat it!

545
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:28,196
It's ours!

546
00:49:28,409 --> 00:49:30,319
Did you buy it?

547
00:49:59,941 --> 00:50:00,855
Faster!

548
00:50:01,067 --> 00:50:02,313
We're tired.

549
00:50:02,527 --> 00:50:05,149
You'll get a rest
when you're dead.

550
00:50:05,363 --> 00:50:09,444
- When do we get to eat?
- When you get the work done.

551
00:50:09,659 --> 00:50:12,067
Give me the money
you owe me.

552
00:50:13,454 --> 00:50:16,409
Look what I've got!
A bunch of slackers!

553
00:50:19,043 --> 00:50:22,294
If that crook doesn't pay us,
let's wreck the carousel.

554
00:50:30,221 --> 00:50:30,886
Is Pedro here?

555
00:50:31,097 --> 00:50:33,137
He haven't come home
since the other night.

556
00:50:33,349 --> 00:50:35,722
That's strange. Something
must have happened to him.

557
00:50:35,935 --> 00:50:37,514
God only knows!

558
00:50:38,312 --> 00:50:40,982
Tonio has put a marble
in his mouth.

559
00:50:43,192 --> 00:50:45,435
Give me what you've got
in your mouth.

560
00:50:57,707 --> 00:50:59,454
Were you very young
when you got married?

561
00:50:59,657 --> 00:51:01,667
I was 14 when Pedro was born.

562
00:51:01,878 --> 00:51:03,918
Is your husband still alive?

563
00:51:04,881 --> 00:51:07,289
No, he died five years ago.

564
00:51:14,599 --> 00:51:15,928
That's the little dogs.

565
00:51:17,894 --> 00:51:19,472
Let's go and see them!

566
00:52:12,823 --> 00:52:14,283
Are you leaving already?

567
00:52:44,105 --> 00:52:46,478
Please, for the band.

568
00:52:52,412 --> 00:52:53,658
Small Eyes!

569
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:55,824
Pedro, what are you doing here?

570
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:57,951
As you can see, I'm working.

571
00:52:58,167 --> 00:52:59,283
How's everything going?

572
00:52:59,502 --> 00:53:00,417
The same as usual.

573
00:53:00,628 --> 00:53:02,918
Have you seen the gang?

574
00:53:03,131 --> 00:53:05,800
I see Pimples
when I go for milk.

575
00:53:06,009 --> 00:53:07,919
- What about Jaïbo?
- I've seen him too.

576
00:53:08,136 --> 00:53:10,295
The cops haven't arrested him?

577
00:53:11,806 --> 00:53:14,132
Get to work!

578
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:18,980
Where have you seen Jaïbo?

579
00:53:19,188 --> 00:53:22,309
He sleeps next to the place
where I live with the blind man.

580
00:53:22,525 --> 00:53:24,982
- Are they looking for me?
- No.

581
00:53:25,403 --> 00:53:28,606
- Really?
- Nobody knows where you are.

582
00:53:31,451 --> 00:53:32,946
Get lost!

583
00:53:36,122 --> 00:53:37,582
Where are you going?

584
00:54:13,266 --> 00:54:14,976
Where have you been
all this time?

585
00:54:16,312 --> 00:54:18,222
Around here, in the street.

586
00:54:18,439 --> 00:54:20,231
I've been working at a carousel.

587
00:54:20,691 --> 00:54:23,148
Why have you come back?
You should have stayed there.

588
00:54:26,101 --> 00:54:28,011
I ran away...
I can't say why.

589
00:54:28,228 --> 00:54:30,056
But I didn't do anything bad.

590
00:54:30,272 --> 00:54:32,894
Don't treat me like this.
I'd prefer it if you hit me.

591
00:54:38,405 --> 00:54:39,437
Don't touch me.

592
00:54:39,656 --> 00:54:43,737
I'd like to behave better,
but I don't know how to.

593
00:54:44,536 --> 00:54:48,237
You're acting like this with me
because of Jaïbo, it's his fault.

594
00:54:49,666 --> 00:54:50,580
Why did you do that?

595
00:54:50,792 --> 00:54:53,118
Because you're a punk,
and a thief!

596
00:54:53,336 --> 00:54:56,457
You were at the workshop
only so you could steal things.

597
00:54:56,673 --> 00:54:57,954
I didn't steal anything!

598
00:54:58,508 --> 00:55:02,127
I'll gong to take you
where you deserve.

599
00:55:08,018 --> 00:55:09,133
Would you dare do that?

600
00:55:12,731 --> 00:55:15,353
No, Mum...
Take me wherever you want.

601
00:55:28,173 --> 00:55:32,503
We couldn't establish
proof of his guilt.

602
00:55:32,719 --> 00:55:36,504
But since you can't
look after him properly,

603
00:55:36,723 --> 00:55:39,345
we're sending him
to the farm-school.

604
00:55:39,559 --> 00:55:41,636
We need your consent.

605
00:55:41,853 --> 00:55:44,143
- That's fine by me.
- Sign here.

606
00:55:44,356 --> 00:55:47,192
- I can't write.
- Do a cross.

607
00:55:47,692 --> 00:55:49,271
I imagine you'd like
to see him?

608
00:55:49,528 --> 00:55:50,987
No... what for?

609
00:55:51,696 --> 00:55:53,607
It's the parents
we should be punishing

610
00:55:53,823 --> 00:55:55,651
for the way they
raise their children.

611
00:55:55,867 --> 00:55:58,869
They're deprived of affection,
so they look for it anywhere.

612
00:55:59,204 --> 00:56:03,950
I work all day long so that
we can have food to eat.

613
00:56:04,501 --> 00:56:05,961
Don't you love your son?

614
00:56:06,378 --> 00:56:11,456
Why should I love him? I don't
even know who his father is.

615
00:56:12,263 --> 00:56:15,926
That's OK...
but go and see him.

616
00:56:18,297 --> 00:56:20,348
- Mendoza, take her with you.
- Follow me.

617
00:56:32,379 --> 00:56:33,459
What's he done?

618
00:56:33,671 --> 00:56:34,704
I don't know.

619
00:56:45,808 --> 00:56:49,178
The judge told me to see you.

620
00:56:50,396 --> 00:56:52,189
Aren't you talking to me?

621
00:56:52,857 --> 00:56:55,527
They're going to send you
to the farm-school.

622
00:56:55,735 --> 00:56:58,441
I don't want to go.
I haven't done anything.

623
00:56:58,655 --> 00:57:00,613
You're the one who
had me locked up.

624
00:57:00,823 --> 00:57:01,773
Listen, my son...

625
00:57:01,991 --> 00:57:03,237
"My son"!

626
00:57:03,451 --> 00:57:06,786
I came home just to see you,
you brought me here,

627
00:57:06,996 --> 00:57:10,912
and now, you feel sorry for me!
It's your fault.

628
00:57:16,422 --> 00:57:19,709
But you... stole the knife.

629
00:57:20,635 --> 00:57:25,049
I didn't steal it! I told the judge
that, and I'm telling you now.

630
00:57:25,390 --> 00:57:27,348
Why would I lie?

631
00:57:27,559 --> 00:57:28,758
Who did it, then?

632
00:57:28,977 --> 00:57:32,726
It's up to the cops to find him.
That's what they're paid for.

633
00:57:34,774 --> 00:57:37,776
Have they sent you
to make me talk?

634
00:57:39,779 --> 00:57:40,693
Pedro!

635
00:57:41,698 --> 00:57:45,150
Yes, that's why you're here.

636
00:57:45,368 --> 00:57:47,575
Why don't you beat me?

637
00:57:47,787 --> 00:57:51,620
You brought me here, didn't you?
Don't play at being a good mum.

638
00:57:53,001 --> 00:57:54,662
I believe you, my darling.

639
00:57:55,503 --> 00:57:58,458
Now, you've remembered
I'm your darling.

640
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:27,234
I want to get out of here!
I didn't steal anything! Mum!

641
00:58:35,752 --> 00:58:39,204
I haven't been able to come back
since the other night.

642
00:58:39,839 --> 00:58:43,541
I heard about Pedro,
that's why I've come.

643
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:46,216
I want to see him.

644
00:58:46,763 --> 00:58:48,590
- I'll help you.
- Let go.

645
00:58:55,438 --> 00:58:57,266
I'm really sorry!

646
00:58:57,482 --> 00:59:00,733
They've arrested the guy and

647
00:59:00,943 --> 00:59:03,696
they could make him talk.

648
00:59:06,870 --> 00:59:08,651
Don't worry.
He didn't rat on you.

649
00:59:08,868 --> 00:59:11,574
Rat on me?

650
00:59:11,954 --> 00:59:12,987
Why should he?

651
00:59:14,624 --> 00:59:17,198
You went to see him
on the day of the theft.

652
00:59:17,418 --> 00:59:18,415
Me?

653
00:59:19,128 --> 00:59:22,629
I can see you're in
a bad mood. I'm going.

654
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:25,000
Don't ever come back.

655
00:59:44,237 --> 00:59:47,654
When you're clean like you are
now, you become another man.

656
00:59:48,533 --> 00:59:52,152
Your file says you can't read
and you were accused of theft.

657
00:59:52,370 --> 00:59:53,320
I didn't steal anything.

658
00:59:54,330 --> 00:59:58,411
Don't be scared.
You're not in jail here.

659
00:59:58,626 --> 01:00:01,628
We're going to teach you to read
and you'll also learn a trade.

660
01:00:01,838 --> 01:00:04,330
For instance... you could
become a mechanic.

661
01:00:07,593 --> 01:00:10,002
There was a boy like you here.

662
01:00:10,221 --> 01:00:11,716
Now he's driving a locomotive.

663
01:00:11,931 --> 01:00:13,675
- I want to leave.
- Why?

664
01:00:13,891 --> 01:00:15,090
I haven't done anything.

665
01:00:15,309 --> 01:00:17,184
Are you a good boy?

666
01:00:17,395 --> 01:00:20,101
No, but I didn't steal
the knife.

667
01:00:22,316 --> 01:00:25,271
Apparently, you like animals.

668
01:00:25,486 --> 01:00:29,532
You'll be very happy
with the work here.

669
01:00:29,741 --> 01:00:34,071
Assign him to the poultry area.

670
01:00:34,412 --> 01:00:35,955
Afterwards... we'll see.

671
01:01:19,435 --> 01:01:20,809
Hey, don't do that!

672
01:01:21,017 --> 01:01:21,884
What?

673
01:01:22,102 --> 01:01:25,305
- Don't do that.
- We sell the eggs.

674
01:01:25,522 --> 01:01:27,065
I'll do whatever I want.

675
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:30,600
We'll call the principal.

676
01:01:30,819 --> 01:01:31,436
Go and do it.

677
01:01:33,822 --> 01:01:35,021
You rat!

678
01:01:35,699 --> 01:01:38,107
- Give it to me.
- Watch out or I'll bash you up.

679
01:01:38,326 --> 01:01:39,608
I'd like to see that!

680
01:02:24,294 --> 01:02:26,005
Drop that stick!

681
01:02:28,044 --> 01:02:30,338
Lock him until he cools off.

682
01:02:32,248 --> 01:02:33,963
Go back to work.

683
01:02:40,904 --> 01:02:43,609
What are we going
to do with him?

684
01:02:43,823 --> 01:02:48,735
We'll leave him to stew for a few
hours, and make sure he eats well.

685
01:02:48,953 --> 01:02:51,077
People think better
on a full stomach.

686
01:02:51,289 --> 01:02:53,448
Afterwards... we'll see.

687
01:02:53,666 --> 01:02:54,830
Why are you smiling?

688
01:02:55,043 --> 01:03:00,548
No reason. If we could lock
poverty up instead of children...

689
01:03:20,693 --> 01:03:21,857
Follow me.

690
01:03:41,130 --> 01:03:43,457
You're calmer now, aren't you?

691
01:03:44,509 --> 01:03:48,092
Let's have a talk.
Why did you kill the chickens?

692
01:03:48,304 --> 01:03:49,052
I don't know.

693
01:03:49,722 --> 01:03:52,808
I do. Since you believe
you're in jail,

694
01:03:53,017 --> 01:03:56,719
you think we all hate you
and you wanted to kill us.

695
01:03:56,938 --> 01:03:59,856
But you didn't dare so the
chickens took our place, right?

696
01:04:01,109 --> 01:04:01,975
Yes, sir.

697
01:04:04,612 --> 01:04:08,065
Have a care. The chickens
might want their own revenge.

698
01:04:09,075 --> 01:04:12,575
Look, we're not a prison here.

699
01:04:17,875 --> 01:04:19,952
Look at the gate.

700
01:04:20,378 --> 01:04:23,712
There aren't any policemen.
It's always open.

701
01:04:24,173 --> 01:04:27,460
Seeing that
I want you to trust me...

702
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:29,919
go on and take it.

703
01:04:33,015 --> 01:04:36,516
You can go out. On the right,
there's a tobacco shop.

704
01:04:36,728 --> 01:04:39,397
Here's 50 pesos.
I don't have anything smaller.

705
01:04:39,606 --> 01:04:42,180
Bring me a pack of cigarettes
like that one.

706
01:04:47,030 --> 01:04:49,154
What are you waiting for?
Go on!

707
01:04:52,577 --> 01:04:55,413
- You've got a lot of money.
- I'd like to have more!

708
01:04:55,622 --> 01:04:58,493
This educational method
is going to cost you a fortune.

709
01:04:58,708 --> 01:04:59,907
If you give money
to all of them...

710
01:05:00,126 --> 01:05:03,995
Not to all of them, each one
has a different problem,

711
01:05:04,214 --> 01:05:07,963
but this boy needs
trust and affection.

712
01:05:08,176 --> 01:05:09,457
What if he doesn't come back?

713
01:05:09,677 --> 01:05:13,344
I'll have lost 50 pesos. You have
to pay for your mistakes.

714
01:05:25,401 --> 01:05:26,351
Pedro!

715
01:05:27,529 --> 01:05:28,609
What are you doing here?

716
01:05:28,822 --> 01:05:33,116
I found out you were here
so I came to see you.

717
01:05:34,372 --> 01:05:35,283
Did they let you out?

718
01:05:35,495 --> 01:05:36,658
I'm running an errand.

719
01:05:36,871 --> 01:05:40,739
They must trust you!
Have you squealed on me?

720
01:05:40,958 --> 01:05:41,991
I'm not a rat.

721
01:05:42,210 --> 01:05:44,287
- You haven't said anything?
- Not a thing.

722
01:05:44,504 --> 01:05:45,915
Good for you!

723
01:05:46,547 --> 01:05:47,378
Move.

724
01:05:48,508 --> 01:05:51,379
You know what happens
if anyone squeals on me?

725
01:05:54,097 --> 01:05:57,383
When I was arrested for the
knife, you didn't say anything.

726
01:05:57,600 --> 01:06:02,228
Why bring that up?
Besides, they've let you out.

727
01:06:03,147 --> 01:06:06,434
A 50-peso note!

728
01:06:07,026 --> 01:06:07,774
Who gave it to you?

729
01:06:07,985 --> 01:06:09,066
The principal.

730
01:06:09,278 --> 01:06:12,980
Well, he won't see it again.
Come on, let's clear off.

731
01:06:13,199 --> 01:06:15,323
- I wanna go back to the school.
- Are you crazy.

732
01:06:15,535 --> 01:06:16,698
I want to go back.

733
01:06:16,911 --> 01:06:18,406
Give me the note.

734
01:06:29,298 --> 01:06:31,422
Give it to me or
I'll break your wrist.

735
01:07:01,539 --> 01:07:02,286
Hey, Pedro!

736
01:07:08,045 --> 01:07:09,838
He's angry with me.

737
01:07:10,047 --> 01:07:12,006
You're not upset any more?

738
01:07:12,216 --> 01:07:13,248
Give me that money.

739
01:07:13,467 --> 01:07:14,215
What money?

740
01:07:14,427 --> 01:07:16,171
The 50 pesos you
stole from me.

741
01:07:16,387 --> 01:07:17,088
Me?

742
01:07:17,305 --> 01:07:19,263
- I want that note.
- Why?

743
01:07:19,473 --> 01:07:21,017
To give it back to the principal.

744
01:07:21,225 --> 01:07:24,512
You're a wimp.

745
01:07:24,729 --> 01:07:26,687
And you're a thief.

746
01:07:26,898 --> 01:07:29,306
Go back to your mother.

747
01:07:33,453 --> 01:07:34,830
Leave my mother out of it.

748
01:07:35,957 --> 01:07:37,333
Didn't she get enough?

749
01:07:46,634 --> 01:07:47,833
Go, Jaïbo!

750
01:08:06,112 --> 01:08:07,328
Bastards!

751
01:08:34,557 --> 01:08:35,554
Let him go.

752
01:08:54,377 --> 01:08:57,329
You won't get me
like you got Julian!

753
01:08:57,627 --> 01:08:58,292
You're lying!

754
01:08:58,628 --> 01:09:00,337
It was him, I saw him!

755
01:09:00,547 --> 01:09:02,006
Liar!

756
01:09:02,215 --> 01:09:04,505
You clubbed him to death.

757
01:09:06,511 --> 01:09:08,172
He's the one who did it,
we have to get the police!

758
01:09:08,888 --> 01:09:10,597
You're going to pay for that!

759
01:09:11,599 --> 01:09:13,143
He's running away! Police!

760
01:09:13,351 --> 01:09:15,677
Let's get away or we'll
all be arrested.

761
01:09:22,902 --> 01:09:26,948
All these criminals should be
strung up by their feet.

762
01:09:27,157 --> 01:09:30,075
In the time of the General,
no one dared speak up.

763
01:09:30,285 --> 01:09:34,948
Bread thieves were executed by
firing squad, to set an example.

764
01:09:35,165 --> 01:09:36,541
But now, we're helpless.

765
01:09:36,749 --> 01:09:38,577
Julian was such a good boy!

766
01:09:38,793 --> 01:09:40,834
It's always the good ones
that are taken from us.

767
01:09:42,297 --> 01:09:44,041
What do you want?

768
01:09:44,257 --> 01:09:47,045
Please, lead me to
the police station.

769
01:09:47,260 --> 01:09:51,009
There are some things I want
to tell them about Jaïbo.

770
01:09:51,472 --> 01:09:54,593
- To the police station?
- Yes, let's go!

771
01:10:05,698 --> 01:10:07,987
- You're alone?
- Yes, come in.

772
01:10:08,451 --> 01:10:09,317
What's up with you?

773
01:10:09,535 --> 01:10:13,865
Nothing.
Does Jaïbo still sleep here?

774
01:10:14,081 --> 01:10:15,327
Yes, but he gets in very late.

775
01:10:15,541 --> 01:10:16,289
Where does he sleep?

776
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:18,161
In the empty house next door.

777
01:10:18,377 --> 01:10:19,327
Bye!

778
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:25,332
The blind man's coming.
What should I do?

779
01:10:28,804 --> 01:10:31,213
Hide over there
and don't make a sound.

780
01:10:42,651 --> 01:10:44,277
Are you still sick?

781
01:10:44,487 --> 01:10:45,733
Yes, sir.

782
01:10:46,238 --> 01:10:50,154
If you were able to eat,
you'd get well.

783
01:10:50,451 --> 01:10:53,406
But with me, you have to work
if you want to eat.

784
01:10:57,291 --> 01:10:58,952
You're such a lazybones!

785
01:11:01,837 --> 01:11:05,207
Good evening, Don Carmelo.
I've brought you the milk.

786
01:11:05,424 --> 01:11:09,043
Thank you, my girl.
It had slipped my mind.

787
01:11:09,261 --> 01:11:12,762
What with everything that's been
going on in the neighbourhood...

788
01:11:14,183 --> 01:11:16,141
OK, I'll head off now.

789
01:11:16,435 --> 01:11:17,634
Hang on, this is for the milk.

790
01:11:19,355 --> 01:11:20,055
Thanks.

791
01:11:20,523 --> 01:11:23,690
Ah my wonderful Metche!
Sit down for a minute.

792
01:11:23,901 --> 01:11:26,820
You're a good girl.

793
01:11:27,780 --> 01:11:29,524
Your hair smells nice.

794
01:11:30,199 --> 01:11:32,323
But I never wash it.

795
01:11:33,244 --> 01:11:34,620
You don't need to

796
01:11:34,829 --> 01:11:36,110
at your age.

797
01:11:36,330 --> 01:11:40,874
There's nothing better
than a natural scent.

798
01:11:41,085 --> 01:11:44,704
It's a pity that God
deprived me of my eyesight.

799
01:11:46,215 --> 01:11:51,257
You must be pretty as an angel
but as naughty as a devil.

800
01:11:51,470 --> 01:11:52,586
I'm leaving.

801
01:11:52,805 --> 01:11:56,720
Wait, I want to
give you something.

802
01:11:56,934 --> 01:12:02,356
Two sweets for my little Metche.
And they're nice ones.

803
01:12:03,858 --> 01:12:05,519
But before...

804
01:12:09,167 --> 01:12:09,912
Small Eyes!

805
01:12:11,750 --> 01:12:13,162
Come here!

806
01:12:14,586 --> 01:12:16,165
What was that?

807
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:19,040
Something... fell down, sir.

808
01:12:30,435 --> 01:12:32,061
Is that why you've been
pretending to be sick?

809
01:12:32,271 --> 01:12:34,940
To let in thieves like you?

810
01:12:35,148 --> 01:12:37,023
Let go of me.
It was no thief.

811
01:12:37,234 --> 01:12:40,402
I'm going to kill you,
you little punk.

812
01:12:40,612 --> 01:12:43,614
It was Jaïbo, he's the criminal!
He wants to kill me!

813
01:12:43,824 --> 01:12:46,316
You old brute!
Don't hit him!

814
01:12:46,535 --> 01:12:47,698
Run!

815
01:12:48,203 --> 01:12:51,122
- You old fool!
- Get out of here!

816
01:12:52,499 --> 01:12:56,201
Your father was right
to leave you. Dead right!

817
01:12:56,587 --> 01:12:57,963
Ingrates!

818
01:12:58,255 --> 01:13:01,423
I'll have done with

819
01:13:01,633 --> 01:13:03,045
all of you soon enough.

820
01:13:34,178 --> 01:13:36,169
Metche, have you seen my son?

821
01:13:36,386 --> 01:13:39,257
Your son? No, I haven't

822
01:13:45,436 --> 01:13:47,477
Why did you lie?

823
01:13:47,814 --> 01:13:49,808
Because she knows he's escaped.

824
01:13:50,024 --> 01:13:52,018
She's looking for him to...

825
01:13:53,111 --> 01:13:54,736
What are you going to do?

826
01:13:54,946 --> 01:13:59,858
Don't know. Maybe go to the market
to look for my Dad.

827
01:14:01,995 --> 01:14:04,154
I've got one peso.

828
01:14:04,664 --> 01:14:07,867
Take it and buy some food.

829
01:14:09,210 --> 01:14:11,204
Thanks. Bye.

830
01:14:11,629 --> 01:14:13,457
Take care.

831
01:14:17,594 --> 01:14:21,046
Small Eyes, take your tooth.
It'll protect you.

832
01:14:58,092 --> 01:15:00,170
He can't possibly escape.

833
01:15:00,386 --> 01:15:03,472
But you'll have to wait,
he turns up late.

834
01:16:24,387 --> 01:16:25,337
Jaïbo!

835
01:16:25,972 --> 01:16:29,508
Now, I'm gonna make you pay.

836
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:46,281
Stop, don't kill me!

837
01:17:04,839 --> 01:17:06,007
Grandpa!

838
01:17:07,133 --> 01:17:10,752
There's someone in the barn.
The animals are agitated.

839
01:17:33,525 --> 01:17:34,606
It's Pedro!

840
01:17:34,818 --> 01:17:36,195
Someone's killed him.

841
01:17:37,780 --> 01:17:39,572
I know who it was, Grandpa.

842
01:17:39,782 --> 01:17:44,076
Shut your mouth, people might
think we're involved.

843
01:17:44,286 --> 01:17:45,616
I don't want the police
coming here.

844
01:17:45,829 --> 01:17:47,538
What should we do?

845
01:17:49,208 --> 01:17:53,918
We'll load him onto the donkey
and dump him somewhere.

846
01:17:55,839 --> 01:17:58,414
Get dressed quickly!

847
01:18:23,700 --> 01:18:25,279
Stop or I'll shoot!

848
01:18:29,206 --> 01:18:30,666
That's one less...

849
01:18:32,292 --> 01:18:34,666
They'll all end up like that.

850
01:18:36,004 --> 01:18:40,418
It would be better to kill them
before they're born.

851
01:18:41,677 --> 01:18:43,836
<i>You've been taken
care of, Jaïbo.</i>

852
01:18:44,054 --> 01:18:46,511
<i>Right in the head.</i>

853
01:18:47,141 --> 01:18:50,226
<i>Watch out, here's the mangy dog.</i>

854
01:18:50,436 --> 01:18:52,643
<i>Look, he's coming.</i>

855
01:18:56,900 --> 01:18:59,606
<i>That's it, I'm falling
into the black hole.</i>

856
01:19:00,070 --> 01:19:01,613
<i>I'm alone.</i>

857
01:19:02,531 --> 01:19:03,695
<i>Alone!</i>

858
01:19:04,908 --> 01:19:08,278
<i>The same as always, kiddo,
the same as always.</i>

859
01:19:08,620 --> 01:19:10,531
<i>There's nothing more
to think about.</i>

860
01:19:11,373 --> 01:19:12,999
<i>Sleep, boy.</i>

861
01:19:13,584 --> 01:19:14,783
<i>Sleep.</i>

862
01:19:26,430 --> 01:19:27,462
Good evening.
