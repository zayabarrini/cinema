00:01:16,166 --> 00:01:19,999
about the recent resurgence of

18
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:25,832
violent anti-state movements

19
00:01:25,916 --> 00:01:29,707
instigated by radical left subversives,

20
00:01:29,875 --> 00:01:33,332
and emphasized the importance of

21
00:01:33,416 --> 00:01:38,957
protecting social order and national security.

Bring him back.

Sir, we have a situation.

Director's on his way.

36
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,165
He can't be resuscitated.

37
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,290
Move the body.

38
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:56,207
Come on.

39
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:57,290
I'm sorry.

40
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:58,832
Hold it properly!

00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:13,415
Eradicate communism!

42
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:21,040
Come on.

43
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:39,457
Who called the doctor?

44
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,374
I did, sir.

45
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:43,499
He was just a testifier, so...

46
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:46,249
Without reporting first?

47
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:49,165
You realize you made a witness.

48
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:50,999
What are you gonna do about this?

49
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:58,749
No need to fuss over nothing.

50
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:01,499
Go have lunch.

51
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:05,790

00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:07,874
Eradicate communism!

53
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:17,207
What should we do with the body?

54
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:20,499
Burn it.

55
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:25,040
As you command, sir.

56
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:41,249
Welcome.

The President wanted to

64
00:05:58,083 --> 00:05:59,540
give this to you in person but...

65
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:01,790
It's an honor either way.

66
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:06,665
What have you got for me?

67
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,915
Kim Jung-Nam?

68
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:16,915
He's the one behind a series of

69
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,124
communist activities of late.

70
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:22,582
He doesn't hold rank or have a title.

71
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:27,749
He wrote the decree for democratization

issued by the opposition leaders,

73

Kim Young-Sam and Kim Dae-Jung.

74
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:38,165
You want to bring all of them
in a single package?

75
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:41,332
If I can prove that
they're supporters of Kim ll-sung,

76
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:43,624
we can wipe out those challenging

77
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:46,957
the reinstatement of the President.

78
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:51,290
You sure live up to your reputation.

79
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,957
The master of the Blue House may

80
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:54,832
come and go but you remain strong.

81
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:57,290
This man needs to be apprehended

82
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:00,540
before the new university semester.

83
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:02,415

You said 5PM before!

86
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:18,957
Are you messing with me?

87
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:20,332
I don't remember.

88
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:23,290
I can't even remember what I had for lunch.

89
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:28,540
Look at you, filling the sacred
soju bottles with gasoline...

90
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:30,749
-It's not gasoline.
-What is it then?

91
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:32,207
It's paint thinner.

92
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:34,915
Don't get smart with me.

93
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,707
-Food delivery.
-In there.

94
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:39,040
What else am I supposed to call it?

95
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,124
Having fun hanging out here?

96
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:46,915
Your parents must be so damn proud of you.

97
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:48,749
You little shit.

98
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:53,665
I'm screwed whatever I say.

99
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:05,374
Oh, no!

100
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:09,082
You shouldn't be eating that crap.

101
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,957
What brings you here at this hour?

102
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:12,749
Come with us.

103
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:14,374
I'll treat you to a proper dinner.

104
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:17,165
Sounds like an idea.

105
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:18,457

106
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:20,832
Can you sign this for us?

107
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:27,374
No such thing as a free drink.

108
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:30,582
Using dirty tricks on me now?

109
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:33,665
Come on, Prosecutor.

110
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:37,374
Park Jong-chul, Seoul National University...

111
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,999
Died of a heart attack?

112
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:40,624
A 22-year-old?

113
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:42,874
Needs to be cremated tonight.

114
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:48,457
I'll get going.

115
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:52,124
Do stay and enjoy the rest of the night.

116
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:54,915
You deserve some down time.

117
00:08:56,625 --> 00:09:00,999
There won't be any problems
with that dead college kid, right?

118
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:02,540
Sure.

119
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,332
It's being taken care of.

120

"Authorization for cremation"

121
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:21,790
He's been dead for less than 8 hours.

122
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:24,290
Has the family seen the body?

123
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:28,499
They haven't, have they?

124
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:31,832
We obtained consent from his father
at the Busan Police Station.

125
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:35,082
Who would agree to have his son cremated

126
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:37,915
without even seeing the body?

127
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:41,957
Who are you trying to kid?

128
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:44,624
This is Anti-communist matter. Just sign it.

129
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:47,082
Don't fucking tell me what to do.

130
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:49,207
Take the paper and get out.

131
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:58,415
Come on, cut us some slack.

132
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:03,624
Just sign the paper and let's get out of here.

133
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,915
All expense paid.

134
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:10,707
This is so sloppy that you're making me blush.

135
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,165
You need an autopsy before burial or cremation.

136
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,374
That's the law.

137
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:19,124
Yes, we know that.

138
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:24,165
But the powers-that-be
want this wrapped up by morning.

139
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:30,124
What...

140
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:32,915
What powers?

141
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,374
The Intelligence Agency?

142
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:35,957
The Blue House?

143
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:37,999
Man

144
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:41,249
Help us out here.

145
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:46,665
Do the autopsy in the morning,

146
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,249
have it cremated by afternoon.

147
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:53,415
Damn, all soggy now.

148
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:05,707
See you again.

149
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:11,415
The crematorium is closed now anyway.

150
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,124
This'll put your father-in-law
in a difficult position.

151
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:16,207
I know that but...

152
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:18,540
Don't make it hard for everyone.

153
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:20,207
Just do as you're told.

154
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:22,082
Yes sir.

155
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:38,165
There's someone here to see you.

156
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:45,707
I thought you had a dinner to go to.

157
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:48,582
It's hard to eat
when the Blue House is calling.

158
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,207
What's wrong with you?

159
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:53,957
Those Anti-communist thugs think
they're above everyone.

160
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,915
I wanted to teach them a lesson.

161
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,582
Who are you trying to teach?

162
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:01,040
Think this is funny?

163
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:05,790
Sign the document, or we're in for shit.

164
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:07,582
I'll handle this my way, sir.

165
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:10,540
I don't care how high up your father-in-law is.

166
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:15,290
If I get another call,
I'll fucking sign it myself.

167
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:19,790
ls that clear?

168
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,207
I'll sign it.

169
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:28,832
I thought it might be an important call.

170
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:58,249
"Restraining order against cremation"

171
00:12:58,750 --> 00:12:59,957
Lay a finger on that body,

172
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,540
and I'll have your asses.

173
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:04,249
Prosecutor Choi!

174
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:08,874
Prosecutor!

175
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:10,749
Open the door.

176
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,957
Open it, dammit!

177
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:25,290

"Prosecutor Lee

179

You slow ass...

180
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:32,999
I'm so damn busy nowadays,

181
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:37,624
I don't even have time
to wash my hands after toilet.

182
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:39,582
You never do anyway.

183
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:44,624
Do I deserve
all this love and attention from you?

184
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:47,499
Come on, let's get dinner.

185
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:50,624
Does your wife still make that soup of hers?

186
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:52,540
I can't go home.

187
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:54,249
What did you do this time?

188
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:58,499
Nothing yet. But I'll wind up
breaking something if I go home.

189
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:03,499
Who pissed you off this time?

190
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:06,540
Those little shits down
at the Anti-communist Investigations

191
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:09,790
act like they're above prosecutors.

192
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:13,707
They think they're tough shit.

193
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:16,374
But who dares question their authority?

194
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:19,624
I'll just screw them
and hand in my resignation.

195
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:25,457
They won't bat an eyelid. It's not worth it.

196
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:28,790
Speaking of which,

197
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:31,249
I need a favor from you.

198
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:32,874
A favor?

199
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:46,915
Good play!

200
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:52,374
Good game.

201
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:54,665
Good job.

202
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:58,832
Your ball is so fast.

203
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:05,332
Looks like that new tonic
you're taking is a fountain of youth.

204
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:09,749
We can't find Prosecutor Choi.

205
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:12,707
We even checked motels in the area.

206
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:14,499
ls he a commie?

207
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:17,457
I just don't understand.

208
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:28,999

Sir, Prosecutor Choi is missing.

212

That pain in the ass!

213
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:44,374
Get some men out and find him.

214
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:46,207
Yes sir.

You pain in the ass...

Hey, Choi! Get up!

218

-Morning, sir.
-Did you sleep well?

219
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:08,790
Director Park
called me first thing this morning.

220
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:11,457
I don't like where this is going.

221
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,124
Just close the case and move on.

222
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:19,790
I have to have that autopsy.

223
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:22,249
Park is nobody to mess with.

224
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:24,582
I haven't seen a single man

225
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:26,624
who survived pissing him off.

226
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:30,207
Remember that sexual torture case?

227
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:32,832
We went along with what they said,

228
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,290
and wound up eating shit for ourselves.

229
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:37,040
I wanna do this one right.

230
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:38,874

231
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,624
and dig into his family tree,

232
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:45,999
there's bound to be at least one North Korean.

233
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:49,249
Know who you're dealing with.

234
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:56,249
All the circumstances point to
death by torture.

235
00:16:56,291 --> 00:16:58,207
All the more reason to stay out of it.

236
00:16:58,291 --> 00:17:03,957
If it goes public, it'll be a shit storm that
none of us can handle.

237
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:05,749
Exactly.

238
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:07,790
That's why we gotta do this right.

239
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:11,124

240
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,832
Blame it on me,

241
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:21,415
the insubordinate ass-pain that ran wild.

242
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:24,624

00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:29,999
Sure about this?

244
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:30,957
Of course not.

245
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:31,957
What?

246
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:34,207
But I know one thing for sure.

247
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:40,332
Nothing like whiskey for breakfast.

248
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,165
I knew it.

249
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:44,124
What do I do about you?

250
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:46,332
It all worked out then?

No, not law school.

Right. Linguistics.

370
00:24:43,041 --> 00:24:44,249
Out of my way!

371
00:24:52,041 --> 00:24:54,499
So he died of heart attack from sudden shock?

372
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:59,582
I can't comment
until the autopsy has been completed.

373
00:24:59,666 --> 00:25:01,374
Was he still alive at the ER?

374
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:02,915
He didn't come to the ER.

375
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,124
I saw him in Namyeong-dong...

376
00:25:04,166 --> 00:25:05,207
Namyeong-dong?

377
00:25:05,333 --> 00:25:06,749
What did you do?

378
00:25:07,041 --> 00:25:10,540
I arrived after the cardiac arrest occurred.

379
00:25:10,666 --> 00:25:12,165
Give us more details.

380
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:18,290
I arrived at the scene,
dried the body, then checked the -

381
00:25:18,375 --> 00:25:19,832
The kid was wet?

382
00:25:21,625 --> 00:25:23,624
We need details!

383
00:25:24,291 --> 00:25:26,165
Are you saying the body was wet?

384
00:25:26,208 --> 00:25:27,582
The detectives said...

385
00:25:27,666 --> 00:25:31,999
that the deceased was heavily intoxicated,

386
00:25:32,083 --> 00:25:34,499
so he drank a lot of water
during the investigation.

387
00:25:34,541 --> 00:25:36,290
He was heavily intoxicated?

388
00:25:37,083 --> 00:25:38,749
He'd been drinking rice wine...

389
00:25:38,875 --> 00:25:40,249
Who is he kidding?

390
00:25:40,333 --> 00:25:42,207
So did he die of shock or not?

391
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:43,290
What should I write?

392
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:44,790
He didn't give us anything.

393
00:25:44,875 --> 00:25:47,749
We'll be given guidelines anyway.

394
00:25:47,833 --> 00:25:49,082
Do you know any doctor?

395
00:25:49,166 --> 00:25:51,540
Not anyone that can give an interview.

396
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:57,290
-Stay right here, understood?
-Yes sir.

397
00:25:58,875 --> 00:26:00,707

Good afternoon, Prosecutor.

400
00:26:09,708 --> 00:26:13,040
Did you bring enough roll films?

401
00:26:13,125 --> 00:26:15,332
I brought 10 with me.

402
00:26:15,416 --> 00:26:18,249
Good. That's great.

403
00:26:20,458 --> 00:26:22,040
I'm a medical examiner
for the National Crime Lab.

404
00:26:22,125 --> 00:26:23,582
I'll be witnessing.

405
00:26:23,708 --> 00:26:24,957
This is a very sensitive case,

406
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:27,165
so please do everything by the book.

407
00:26:27,791 --> 00:26:31,374
Make sure to leave no detail out.

408
00:26:31,458 --> 00:26:32,915
ls this necessary?

409
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,499
It's just a formality.

00:26:41,541 --> 00:26:42,874
I apologize.

Let's go.

Who are you people?

415
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,624
You can't come in here.

416
00:26:53,708 --> 00:26:55,374
So piss off.

417
00:26:55,958 --> 00:26:58,749
We have an official order for an autopsy.

418
00:26:58,833 --> 00:26:59,874
We heard nothing about it,

419
00:26:59,958 --> 00:27:01,707
so it's not happening.

420
00:27:01,791 --> 00:27:03,915
I'm a public prosecutor!

421
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,499
Oh, really? We're sorry for our insolence.

-Get her outta here.
-Please just for a moment.

428
00:27:35,875 --> 00:27:39,207
-Come on.
-Please for the last time!

00:27:39,291 --> 00:27:42,832
Let me touch his hand!

What are you here for?

431
00:27:53,625 --> 00:27:56,832

This is Prosecutor Choi
with the Seoul District Prosecutor's Office.

439
00:28:24,666 --> 00:28:26,915
I'm at Hanyang Hospital,

440
00:28:27,208 --> 00:28:30,582
and your men are refusing to cooperate.

441
00:28:31,125 --> 00:28:33,540
I've been through this
with the necessary people.

442
00:28:33,833 --> 00:28:35,957
That autopsy isn't happening.

Old man, I don't like your condescending tone.

444
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,332
I'm the Director
of Anti-communist Investigations.

445
00:28:41,416 --> 00:28:44,832
And that puts you above the law?

446
00:28:44,916 --> 00:28:47,832
Should I send over
some of my boys to teach you?

447
00:28:47,916 --> 00:28:48,915
What did you say?

448
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,874
Open your books
and check who has the jurisdiction here.

449
00:28:54,291 --> 00:28:57,665
And you better lose that accent

450
00:28:57,958 --> 00:29:00,249
before you're mistaken for Kim ll-sung.

451
00:29:09,375 --> 00:29:11,040
Get the car out.

452
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:12,374
Yes sir.

453
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:22,374
That crazy fucker!

Nice work hiding behind a piece of paper.

456
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:46,915
Let's not make a scene.

457
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,624
We'll do this by the book.

458
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:56,457
If hunting dogs miss their target

459
00:29:56,541 --> 00:29:58,082

460
00:29:59,333 --> 00:30:03,165
who do you think
the master is going to punish for this?

461
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:04,790
I consider myself a stray

462
00:30:04,875 --> 00:30:06,499
without a master.

463
00:30:06,625 --> 00:30:07,749
You better watch yourself.

464
00:30:07,833 --> 00:30:10,540
I'm liable to bite anyone.

465
00:30:10,791 --> 00:30:11,957
ls that right?

466
00:30:12,416 --> 00:30:16,832
But only your jaws will hurt.

467
00:30:24,666 --> 00:30:25,665
Wait.

468
00:30:29,208 --> 00:30:31,749
My wife's cousin...

469
00:30:32,458 --> 00:30:36,665
just married a journalist
from this foreign newspaper.

470
00:30:36,916 --> 00:30:40,040
Peter Henderson something or other.

471
00:30:40,125 --> 00:30:44,124
He's been hounding me for a story.

472
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,499
The President would be quite upset

473
00:30:47,583 --> 00:30:49,665
to read about this in the foreign press

474
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,374
before the Seoul Olympics.

475
00:30:58,083 --> 00:31:01,832
What is it that you want?

476
00:31:02,708 --> 00:31:07,832
Just wanna do my job right.

477
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:12,290
Alright. Go for it.

478
00:31:13,833 --> 00:31:16,540
It's not going to change anything.

479
00:31:21,041 --> 00:31:22,374
Let's get out of here.

480
00:31:26,541 --> 00:31:27,832
I'm doing the autopsy.

481
00:31:28,125 --> 00:31:30,082
I got your neck.

482
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,249
Go wander the streets
with the rest of the strays.

483
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:42,915
I guess I just dug my own grave.

484
00:31:47,916 --> 00:31:49,749

00:32:50,208 --> 00:32:51,832
I'm going to the restroom.

493
00:33:07,291 --> 00:33:10,665
Doctor, I'm a journalist with Dong-A Daily.

494
00:33:11,458 --> 00:33:13,749
Did you see any signs of torture?

495
00:33:15,041 --> 00:33:17,332
I waited here for too long.

496
00:33:19,041 --> 00:33:21,290
You said the body was wet.

497
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,665
What was the condition of the body?

498
00:33:25,291 --> 00:33:27,665
Just tell me what you saw.

499
00:33:29,291 --> 00:33:30,624
Doctor!

500
00:33:34,166 --> 00:33:39,207
There was water everywhere on the floor.

501
00:33:42,458 --> 00:33:44,290
There was a bath tub in the room.

502
00:33:49,166 --> 00:33:51,790
I heard crackling in the lungs.

503
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,707
Crackles?

504
00:33:54,208 --> 00:33:56,790
Do you confirm the cause of death?

505
00:34:02,375 --> 00:34:03,582
Yes...

506
00:34:19,625 --> 00:34:21,832
No pictures!

00:34:24,708 --> 00:34:27,249
-Mr. Park!
-Any comments?

508
00:34:27,375 --> 00:34:31,540
The police murdered him!

509
00:34:32,625 --> 00:34:34,624
My nephew didn't die of shock.

510
00:34:34,666 --> 00:34:36,749
He was murdered!

511
00:34:37,541 --> 00:34:39,707
He was killed during torture, wasn't he?

512
00:34:40,416 --> 00:34:42,832
He was tortured with water, right?

513
00:34:57,750 --> 00:35:01,999
This is what you'll say
when you give your statement tomorrow.

514
00:35:03,416 --> 00:35:07,457
But I only dropped by to give them a hand.

515
00:35:07,958 --> 00:35:11,457
There are formalities to go through.

516
00:35:12,208 --> 00:35:13,790
Think of it as an early vacation.

517
00:35:13,875 --> 00:35:16,415
I don't deserve this.

518
00:35:18,208 --> 00:35:20,957
How dare you question my authority?

519
00:35:21,041 --> 00:35:23,915
I did everything exactly as I was told.

00:35:24,458 --> 00:35:26,207
-Why should I...
-Han-kyung.

521
00:35:29,166 --> 00:35:30,624
Yes, Director.

522
00:35:32,583 --> 00:35:34,082
Just go along with it.

523
00:35:40,541 --> 00:35:41,624
As you command, sir.

524
00:35:41,791 --> 00:35:44,124
We gotta run the story before

526
00:35:46,083 --> 00:35:48,332
I even got my arm broken!

527
00:35:48,458 --> 00:35:50,082
Will you take the responsibility?

528
00:35:50,291 --> 00:35:53,124
-We should be responsible?
-For what?

529
00:35:53,666 --> 00:35:56,165
-You alright, man?
-What happened?

530
00:35:56,708 --> 00:35:58,249
-Let's go.

who killed him and how.

What about the guidelines?

535
00:36:13,791 --> 00:36:15,832
Fuck that!

Just fuck it

537
00:36:18,083 --> 00:36:20,749
The police tortured and killed a student!

538
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:24,999
I don't give a rat's ass
about goddamn guidelines.

539
00:36:25,541 --> 00:36:26,832
Yes sir.

540
00:36:43,666 --> 00:36:44,790
Dr. Hwang!

541
00:36:44,875 --> 00:36:47,457
I really appreciate
you going through all of this.

542
00:36:47,583 --> 00:36:48,749
Take a seat.

543
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:52,207
How'd it go?

544
00:36:54,083 --> 00:36:59,415
The cause of death was asphyxiation
due to airway obstruction.

545
00:36:59,833 --> 00:37:03,415
The victim's windpipe was crushed during tor-

546
00:37:03,416 --> 00:37:04,957
Watch your mouth!

547
00:37:05,041 --> 00:37:08,957
If you say that boy was tortured,

548
00:37:09,333 --> 00:37:12,374
you'll pretty much
sign all of our death warrants.

549
00:37:13,125 --> 00:37:17,040
But there are marks all over the body.

550
00:37:17,083 --> 00:37:18,874
That'll be taken care of

551
00:37:19,875 --> 00:37:21,874
once the body is cremated.

552
00:37:24,458 --> 00:37:31,457
Just put 'heart attack' in the report.

553
00:37:37,958 --> 00:37:41,624
Here, take some down time with your team.

554
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:48,957
I'm sorry, Commissioner.

555
00:37:52,416 --> 00:37:54,915
You're digging your own grave.

556
00:37:56,500 --> 00:38:00,749
I'm announcing it as heart attack.

557
00:38:09,708 --> 00:38:12,540
"9:00AM Jan 1 6, 1 987"

558
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:16,374
A pulmonary hemorrhage in his right lung,

559
00:38:16,541 --> 00:38:19,082
is most likely a result of TB.

560
00:38:19,583 --> 00:38:21,957
The contusions on the throat and chest

561
00:38:22,166 --> 00:38:25,082
are remnants of efforts at resuscitation.

562
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:29,957
Thus, there were no signs of
unnecessary force or brutality.

563
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,540
Jong-chul!

564
00:38:35,583 --> 00:38:36,957
Mom!

565
00:38:37,041 --> 00:38:40,332
Mom! Mom!

566
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:43,665
Mom...

567
00:38:49,625 --> 00:38:51,582
My son's not a commie...

568
00:38:52,083 --> 00:38:53,582
Mom...mom!

569
00:38:56,333 --> 00:38:58,082
Vehicle #2 on the move.

570
00:39:02,583 --> 00:39:04,249
You're obstructing journalists!

571
00:39:04,333 --> 00:39:05,957
Align shields!

572
00:39:12,041 --> 00:39:13,832
Let us through!

573
00:39:18,958 --> 00:39:20,457
Lift shields!

574
00:39:28,125 --> 00:39:29,582
Mr. Park!

575
00:40:04,666 --> 00:40:06,790
U-turn here?

576
00:40:06,875 --> 00:40:08,040
Wait, wait.

577
00:40:09,708 --> 00:40:11,499
Give me the camera.

578
00:40:12,625 --> 00:40:13,790
But the bus is going straight.

579
00:40:13,875 --> 00:40:15,124
No, not straight.

580
00:40:15,208 --> 00:40:18,749
-What are they doing?
-Which car is which?

581
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:19,915
2382...

582
00:40:19,958 --> 00:40:20,915
Left! Make a left.

583
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:21,874
Left?

584
00:40:21,958 --> 00:40:22,749
Let's go.

585
00:40:25,208 --> 00:40:27,124
Move your damn car!

586
00:40:27,208 --> 00:40:29,207
Get out of the way!

587
00:40:40,708 --> 00:40:42,124
Hey! Hey! Stop them.

588
00:40:42,208 --> 00:40:43,957
Stop the car!

589
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:49,499
-I'm with Dong-A Daily.
-Stop, you rats!

590
00:40:49,583 --> 00:40:51,499
You smashed our camera!

591
00:40:51,666 --> 00:40:52,790
Don't touch me!

592
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,749
Why can't we cover the story?

593
00:40:55,333 --> 00:40:56,915
Why not?

594
00:41:20,416 --> 00:41:21,749
Jong-chul...

595
00:41:26,166 --> 00:41:27,415
Dad...

596
00:41:29,666 --> 00:41:31,957
Why can't you leave?

597
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:37,207
Can't you leave, my boy?

598
00:41:41,791 --> 00:41:45,915
Why do you linger here?

599
00:41:52,583 --> 00:41:56,082
Good bye, my son.

600
00:42:04,375 --> 00:42:09,749
Dad has nothing to say to you.

601
00:42:23,625 --> 00:42:24,999
I'm an accredited reporter!

602
00:42:25,083 --> 00:42:27,790
No one's allowed in today.

603
00:42:32,916 --> 00:42:35,665
More pain in the ass.

604
00:42:43,208 --> 00:42:45,707
Just go, for fuck's sake!

605
00:42:45,791 --> 00:42:47,499
Did you just swear at me?

606
00:42:47,875 --> 00:42:49,499
Easy, Yoon.

607
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:51,582
Let me check some facts.

608
00:42:51,666 --> 00:42:53,957
He died from drowning, didn't he?

609
00:42:54,083 --> 00:42:56,040
Drowning, my ass.

610
00:42:56,833 --> 00:42:59,457
What was it then? Death by excessive force?

611
00:43:00,083 --> 00:43:02,249
Just tell me for god's sake!

612
00:43:02,333 --> 00:43:03,457
Why should I tell you that?

613
00:43:03,541 --> 00:43:04,790
It's your job to find out.

614
00:43:04,875 --> 00:43:06,249
You're in this together.

615
00:43:06,416 --> 00:43:08,082
They promised you something?

616
00:43:08,166 --> 00:43:10,499
A place in the Intelligence? The Blue House?

617
00:43:12,416 --> 00:43:15,915
Yeah, I'm trying to
ass-kiss my way up the ladder.

618
00:43:19,458 --> 00:43:21,082
Shame on you.

619

00:43:45,708 --> 00:43:47,915

This isn't the Internal Affairs office.

626
00:44:38,458 --> 00:44:41,207
What's going on?

627
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:43,124
Cuff them.

628
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:44,874
Let go of me!

629
00:44:45,208 --> 00:44:46,874
Let go!!!

630
00:44:49,208 --> 00:44:50,749
Do not resist.

631
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,499
Back off!

632
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,624
You are arrested for murder
by the use of excessive force.

633
00:45:09,625 --> 00:45:12,540
You are no longer police officers

634
00:45:13,291 --> 00:45:14,999
but criminals.

635
00:45:15,291 --> 00:45:16,374
You hear?

636
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:22,332
I had no choice.

637
00:45:22,666 --> 00:45:23,957
The order came from the Blue House.

638
00:45:24,041 --> 00:45:25,457
Where did you take them?

639
00:45:25,583 --> 00:45:30,165
I can't tell you knowing what you'll do.

640
00:45:33,625 --> 00:45:35,624
Brace yourself, Director Park.

641
00:45:35,708 --> 00:45:38,457
Sometimes you gotta cut off the tail
to save the body.

642
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:43,624
It's the secret office in Shingil, sir.

643
00:45:56,333 --> 00:45:57,790
Back off!

644
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:06,707
Director, please...

645
00:46:12,458 --> 00:46:14,874
-Director!
-Sir!

646
00:46:14,958 --> 00:46:16,415
You fucking heathens.

647
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:18,124
Release him now!

648
00:46:22,583 --> 00:46:24,165
Stop what you're doing!

649
00:46:24,875 --> 00:46:29,124
Do you realize you're disobeying a direct or-

650
00:46:37,375 --> 00:46:41,082
You're disobeying orders
and assaulting superiors?

651
00:46:47,666 --> 00:46:50,290
You think we're the same police, you and I?

652
00:46:50,416 --> 00:46:53,582
While you and your men get fat off bribes,

653
00:46:53,791 --> 00:46:55,040
I'm out there risking my life,

654
00:46:55,125 --> 00:46:56,915
trying to bring down the commies.

655
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:04,332
This country would've been
devoured by Kim ll-sung if it wasn't for me.

656
00:47:04,458 --> 00:47:05,707
Do you understand?

657
00:47:05,833 --> 00:47:06,999
You're making a huge mistake.

658
00:47:07,083 --> 00:47:09,915
If the President finds out about this -

659
00:47:17,208 --> 00:47:18,749
Listen carefully.

660
00:47:19,416 --> 00:47:22,332
Anyone that stands between me and the enemy

661
00:47:24,583 --> 00:47:27,249
is an enemy himself.

662
00:47:37,333 --> 00:47:38,832
Get 'em out of my sight.

663
00:47:39,458 --> 00:47:41,665
Move it.

664
00:47:56,250 --> 00:47:57,249
Does it hurt?

665
00:47:58,125 --> 00:47:59,915
Not as much as my pride.

666
00:48:01,750 --> 00:48:02,999
Lift your head.

667
00:48:04,250 --> 00:48:08,249
You're a patriot. Don't ever cower.

668
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:10,790
They're accusing me of first degree murder.

669
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:13,665
That's a minimum 1 0 years.

670
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:18,957
I'll get the charges
reduced to involuntary manslaughter

671
00:48:19,041 --> 00:48:20,624
then a suspended sentence.

672
00:48:22,458 --> 00:48:24,540
I have five mouths to feed.

673
00:48:26,208 --> 00:48:27,915
I'll take care of them too.

I'm counting on you, sir.

675
00:48:38,375 --> 00:48:39,665
There.

00:48:41,125 --> 00:48:43,207

You should be thinking about
getting married instead.

to marry me.

Were you, huh?

00:50:44,208 --> 00:50:46,207
Wasting your time doing worthless things.

705
00:50:46,291 --> 00:50:47,374
Will you leave me alone?

Are you hanging out
with those bad influences again?

00:50:50,541 --> 00:50:52,499
I'm the bad influence.

to live with his nagging sister.

Damned old thing.

720
00:51:37,083 --> 00:51:39,749
You won't break it like that. Want a hammer?

721
00:51:40,083 --> 00:51:43,499
I told you to fix it, didn't I?

00:52:09,708 --> 00:52:12,582
Get away from me.

729
00:52:14,416 --> 00:52:16,457
It's my college acceptance gift.

730
00:52:23,208 --> 00:52:24,499
Yeon-hee.

731
00:52:31,125 --> 00:52:32,332
And this...

732
00:52:34,125 --> 00:52:35,999
You want me to meet him again?

733
00:52:37,708 --> 00:52:40,665
I get stopped at the checkpoints every time.

734
00:52:40,750 --> 00:52:42,082
They never stop you.

735
00:52:42,166 --> 00:52:44,665
Wake up! You almost lost your job

736
00:52:44,750 --> 00:52:46,040
by messing with that union business!

737
00:52:46,125 --> 00:52:47,665
This isn't about the union.

738
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:48,957
Yeah, right.

739
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:52,499
This is really for a good cause.

740
00:52:52,583 --> 00:52:56,124
I wouldn't ask you if it wasn't a good thing.

741
00:53:01,750 --> 00:53:02,832
Sure about that?

742
00:53:03,416 --> 00:53:05,540
Running an errand for a convict
is a good thing?

743
00:53:06,666 --> 00:53:09,124
-Well, if you feel that way...
-Hey!

744
00:53:10,333 --> 00:53:11,582
You said it was for me.

745
00:53:11,666 --> 00:53:12,790
Du-bong also got into college.

746
00:53:12,875 --> 00:53:14,624
-Who's that?
-My boss'son.

747
00:53:24,291 --> 00:53:25,332
It's the last time, okay?

748
00:53:25,416 --> 00:53:27,165
Deal.

749
00:53:29,625 --> 00:53:31,165
You can record, too?

750
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:32,790
Check out auto-reverse.

751
00:53:33,416 --> 00:53:34,540
Get outta here!

752
00:53:39,166 --> 00:53:41,082
-Gimme that.
-Pass.

753
00:53:48,458 --> 00:53:49,624
You, hey!

754
00:53:49,958 --> 00:53:52,457
Attention! Stop daydreaming!

755
00:53:52,666 --> 00:53:56,582
What the hell are you staring at, assholes?

756
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:01,582
-I'll leave you to it then.
-Thank you, Abbot.

757
00:54:04,666 --> 00:54:06,665
What did you want to see me about?

758
00:54:07,208 --> 00:54:08,415
"Ham Se-woong / Priest"

759
00:54:08,458 --> 00:54:10,499
"Catholic Priests' Association for Justice"

760
00:54:13,541 --> 00:54:14,749
"Kim Jung-Nam"

761
00:54:14,791 --> 00:54:17,457
"Wanted for leading numerous democracy activists"

762
00:54:17,625 --> 00:54:19,874
You're making a statement

763
00:54:20,166 --> 00:54:21,707
demanding truth about the student's death?

764
00:54:21,750 --> 00:54:23,124
We plan to do it tomorrow.

765
00:54:23,250 --> 00:54:27,665
I suggest you don't mention
there're more officers involved.

766
00:54:29,541 --> 00:54:31,540
If the police raise their guard even more,

767
00:54:32,041 --> 00:54:36,874
getting to the bottom of the truth
will become difficult.

768
00:54:38,791 --> 00:54:42,665
I heard the prison security section chief
is tough as nail.

769
00:54:43,125 --> 00:54:45,790
Even the guards aren't allowed to talk to them.

770
00:54:46,916 --> 00:54:48,707
We'll make it happen.

771
00:54:50,208 --> 00:55:01,249
We'll find out the names and ranks
of everyone responsible for the death.

772
00:55:03,625 --> 00:55:05,082
Father,

773
00:55:07,125 --> 00:55:11,957
our only weapon is the truth.

774
00:55:12,833 --> 00:55:17,040
And that truth
will bring down this administration.

775
00:55:17,958 --> 00:55:19,374
Mr. Kim!

776
00:55:21,375 --> 00:55:22,790
Yeon-hee!

777
00:55:28,916 --> 00:55:30,415
Uncle says he's sorry he couldn't

778
00:55:30,458 --> 00:55:32,249
deliver the news you've been waiting for.

779
00:55:33,875 --> 00:55:35,165
I see.

780
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:39,124
You don't look like
you're here for Buddhist service.

781
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:43,624
You must be the ring leader behind all of this.

782
00:55:45,333 --> 00:55:47,790
This is Yeon-hee. She's Guard Han's niece.

783
00:55:48,916 --> 00:55:49,749
Turn yourself in,

784
00:55:49,833 --> 00:55:51,582
and you will find the peace you seek.

785
00:56:02,166 --> 00:56:03,124
Sir!

786
00:56:03,208 --> 00:56:04,374
"Ahn Yoo / Security Section Chief"

787
00:56:04,416 --> 00:56:05,790

00:56:18,583 --> 00:56:19,707
-Jin-gyu!
-Sweetheart...

789
00:56:19,750 --> 00:56:21,415
-Jin-gyu!
-Baby!

790
00:56:23,083 --> 00:56:24,124
Mom...

791
00:56:26,125 --> 00:56:27,040
"4:30PM Feb 20, 1 987"

792
00:56:27,083 --> 00:56:28,165
Dad.

793
00:56:28,250 --> 00:56:30,040
You okay, son?

794
00:56:30,375 --> 00:56:32,915
What have you done?

795
00:56:34,375 --> 00:56:35,665
It's nothing, mom.

796
00:56:35,750 --> 00:56:36,749
I'm going to figure it out.

797
00:56:36,833 --> 00:56:39,290
You killed a man. How can you say it's nothing?

798
00:56:39,708 --> 00:56:44,165
We didn't raise you like that.

799
00:56:44,250 --> 00:56:48,999
Dad, it's not what you think.

800
00:56:49,666 --> 00:56:51,457
You have to believe me.

801
00:56:52,125 --> 00:56:55,582
What do you mean? Tell me what happened.

802
00:56:57,250 --> 00:57:00,999
I only held his legs, but I didn't kill him.

803
00:57:01,125 --> 00:57:03,207
It wasn't me! I didn't do it -

804
00:57:03,333 --> 00:57:04,915
Get him out of here.

805
00:57:05,416 --> 00:57:07,624
-Jin-gyu!
-Son!

806
00:57:07,708 --> 00:57:10,624
Jin-gyu!

807
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,040
Please abide by visitor regulations.

808
00:57:24,916 --> 00:57:26,832
If you write this again,

809
00:57:27,291 --> 00:57:29,665
I'll blow up the goddamn place.

810
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,124
"Visitor's log"

811
00:57:45,458 --> 00:57:46,540
This is Chief Ahn.

812
00:57:46,625 --> 00:57:48,082
This is Han.

813
00:57:48,166 --> 00:57:50,457
4879 requests for a meeting.

814
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:52,957
I'll be right there.

815
00:58:01,833 --> 00:58:03,207
Good evening.

816
00:58:04,708 --> 00:58:06,290
Chief Ahn.

817
00:58:06,916 --> 00:58:08,957
I heard you requested a meeting.

818
00:58:09,333 --> 00:58:11,124
ls there a problem?

819
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:15,832
I heard those new inmates
are causing a problem.

820
00:58:16,833 --> 00:58:19,124
That's the prison's problem.

821
00:58:19,208 --> 00:58:20,749
What are your complaints?

822
00:58:22,291 --> 00:58:27,582
ls it true that
there are more cops involved in the torture?

823
00:58:33,208 --> 00:58:35,915
If you have no complaints,
this interview is over.

824
00:58:36,166 --> 00:58:38,832
You may stay a while longer, if you want.

825
00:58:41,375 --> 00:58:43,207
Do you want to be an accomplice to their crime?

826
00:58:43,291 --> 00:58:46,082
I'm not at liberty
to discuss information obtained on duty.

827
00:58:48,333 --> 00:58:50,874
You can't keep the truth information
behind these bars!

828
00:58:51,958 --> 00:58:56,290
My job is to protect and guard.

829
00:59:20,625 --> 00:59:22,915
"2:00PM Mar 3, 1 987"

830
00:59:22,958 --> 00:59:25,790
"49th day after Park Jong-chul's death"

831
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:27,707
What's the matter with him?

832
00:59:27,791 --> 00:59:28,999
Jung-mi!

833
00:59:29,333 --> 00:59:31,832
Urgh, you're late again!

834
00:59:32,083 --> 00:59:36,082
Getting all prettied
up for blind date, obviously.

835
00:59:36,250 --> 00:59:37,457
Do I look alright?

836
00:59:37,666 --> 00:59:38,665
I just washed my face.

837
00:59:40,083 --> 00:59:41,874
You have lipstick on your teeth.

838
00:59:41,958 --> 00:59:45,082
Down with the student killers,

839
00:59:45,416 --> 00:59:46,582
down with the torturers!

840
00:59:46,666 --> 00:59:47,749
Down with the student killers,

841
00:59:47,791 --> 00:59:49,082
down with the torturers!

842
00:59:49,916 --> 00:59:53,124
Wait, he's cute.

843
00:59:54,458 --> 00:59:55,457
Citizens! Today, there will be...

844
00:59:55,541 --> 00:59:57,707
a memorial service for Park.

845
00:59:57,791 --> 00:59:59,707
Let's rise in protest!

846
00:59:59,958 --> 01:00:03,082
Bring back, Park Jong-chul!

847
01:00:03,166 --> 01:00:05,249
Please take one.

848
01:00:06,041 --> 01:00:07,457
Bring back, Park Jong-chul!

849
01:00:07,458 --> 01:00:08,624
"Memorial march for the late Park Jong-chul"

850
01:00:09,041 --> 01:00:12,040
Bring back, Park Jong-chul!

851
01:00:13,291 --> 01:00:15,040
Come on, let's go.

852
01:00:48,041 --> 01:00:50,707
I'm not a protester!

853
01:01:07,958 --> 01:01:09,540
Goddamn commies!

854
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:23,874
Bitch!

855
01:01:27,041 --> 01:01:28,832
Fucking bitch!

856
01:01:29,041 --> 01:01:30,332
Wait.

857
01:01:34,166 --> 01:01:36,165
Stop, you commies!

858
01:01:48,291 --> 01:01:49,374
This way.

859
01:01:55,708 --> 01:01:56,665
Hurry.

860
01:01:56,791 --> 01:01:58,457
We're closed.

861
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:00,582
Come back later.

862
01:02:01,791 --> 01:02:02,665
Pull the damn thing up.

863
01:02:02,708 --> 01:02:04,999
I said we're closed, dammit!

864
01:02:05,666 --> 01:02:06,540
Pull up the shutter!

865
01:02:06,583 --> 01:02:08,082
Shut your mouth!

866
01:02:17,375 --> 01:02:24,790
Damned protesters...
It was my first blind date.

867
01:02:25,958 --> 01:02:29,457
Don't rub it with your hands. It'll sting more.

868
01:02:33,833 --> 01:02:35,040
Wash it with water.

869
01:02:55,166 --> 01:02:57,665
Your shoe...

870
01:03:02,833 --> 01:03:04,957
I've still got my socks.

871
01:03:05,166 --> 01:03:07,749
If you go out like that,
you're sure to get caught.

872
01:03:08,041 --> 01:03:09,582
Size 9?

873
01:03:10,416 --> 01:03:13,707
It's 8 dollars but you can take them for 5.

874
01:03:15,833 --> 01:03:17,540
I'm sorry but I don't have money now.

875
01:03:17,791 --> 01:03:18,832
Huh?

876
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:20,957
I got this.

877
01:03:21,750 --> 01:03:23,332
No, it's okay.

878
01:03:23,416 --> 01:03:25,040
Let her buy it!

879
01:03:25,208 --> 01:03:26,499
Here.

880
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,540
I'm paying you back.

881
01:03:36,250 --> 01:03:37,540
Oh god...

882
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,957
Hey, wait.

883
01:03:49,250 --> 01:03:52,665
"Visitor's log"

884
01:03:54,166 --> 01:03:57,249
I said no records, goddammit.

885
01:04:03,750 --> 01:04:09,040
I'm cross-checking the statements
because they don't match.

886
01:04:09,958 --> 01:04:14,665
You said that the victim had his hands cuffed
behind his back,

887
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:20,624
but we found no signs of cuffing
on the victim's wrists.

888
01:04:22,250 --> 01:04:24,332
ls this necessary?

889
01:04:25,041 --> 01:04:26,207
The charge is involuntary manslaughter.

890
01:04:26,291 --> 01:04:27,582
Involuntary manslaughter?

891
01:04:30,916 --> 01:04:34,290
Your charges are murder by torture!

892
01:04:36,333 --> 01:04:37,915
The charges haven't been reduced?

893
01:04:38,416 --> 01:04:39,999
In your dreams!

894
01:04:40,083 --> 01:04:44,540
If you don't cooperate, I'll go for 15 years.

895
01:04:44,750 --> 01:04:46,499
Better get your act straight.

896
01:04:48,750 --> 01:04:50,290
Son of a bitch...

897
01:04:50,666 --> 01:04:52,332
What did you say?

898
01:04:53,875 --> 01:04:54,999
I didn't kill him.

899
01:04:55,083 --> 01:04:56,165
What?

900
01:04:56,416 --> 01:04:58,082
Are your deaf?

901
01:04:58,375 --> 01:05:00,540
It wasn't me that killed him!

902
01:05:01,541 --> 01:05:02,624
This isn't how it's supposed to go.

903
01:05:02,666 --> 01:05:03,790
Inspector Cho!

904
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,832
Prosecutor, we'll resume in the near future.

905
01:05:06,958 --> 01:05:10,999
What's going on here?

906
01:05:16,458 --> 01:05:19,040
Tell Director Park
to meet his end of the bargain.

907
01:05:20,166 --> 01:05:21,790
What the hell?

908
01:05:23,416 --> 01:05:25,249
You want a piece of me?

909
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:28,707
You should be telling them that.

910
01:05:30,250 --> 01:05:34,707
Why are you doing this, Cho?

911
01:05:37,708 --> 01:05:40,540
It was you that killed an innocent kid, not me.

912
01:05:42,958 --> 01:05:44,957
Grab him.

913
01:05:45,583 --> 01:05:47,082
Don't you dare!

914
01:05:52,250 --> 01:05:55,332
Your lives depend on my words.

915
01:05:55,583 --> 01:05:57,165
Remember that.

916
01:06:01,125 --> 01:06:02,540
This interview is over.

917
01:06:05,833 --> 01:06:06,790
Fuck!

918
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:19,165
Sir.

919
01:06:19,208 --> 01:06:21,624
What the hell are you retards doing?

920
01:06:21,708 --> 01:06:22,915
Ministry of Culture!

921
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,249
Send out the new journalism guidelines.

922
01:06:25,875 --> 01:06:28,915
The protests are about direct election.

923
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:33,624
That's what is causing
the senseless violence in the streets.

924
01:06:33,708 --> 01:06:35,040
Yes sir.

925
01:06:35,583 --> 01:06:36,707
Ministry of Interior.

926
01:06:36,791 --> 01:06:40,165
Set up more checkpoints,
especially near universities.

927
01:06:40,250 --> 01:06:40,957
Yes sir.

928
01:06:41,041 --> 01:06:44,707
Increase CS gas production to full capacity.

929
01:06:44,791 --> 01:06:46,040
Yes sir.

930
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:48,707
Do I have to tell you every little thing?

931
01:06:57,625 --> 01:07:00,874
I heard about what happened at the prison.

932
01:07:01,333 --> 01:07:04,582
You must reduce the charges
to involuntary manslaughter.

933
01:07:04,666 --> 01:07:07,707
We just managed to put out the fire,

934
01:07:08,208 --> 01:07:10,749
and now you want to rekindle it.

935
01:07:10,833 --> 01:07:12,499
"Park Jong-chul protests on rise"

936
01:07:13,250 --> 01:07:16,207
It'll be a loose end if we don't.

937
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,874
I can postpone the trial indefinitely.

938
01:07:22,416 --> 01:07:24,082
You figure out the rest.

939
01:07:26,708 --> 01:07:32,124
The President is deeply concerned
about this matter.

940
01:07:55,208 --> 01:07:56,832
Thousand, ten thousand...

941
01:07:57,583 --> 01:07:59,290
hundred thousand dollars?

942
01:08:03,250 --> 01:08:05,999
This for 1 0 years of my life?

943
01:08:09,625 --> 01:08:11,582
I want out of here in a month.

944
01:08:12,125 --> 01:08:15,624
After the President
passes down the presidency to his successor,

945
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:18,915
there'll be a presidential pardon.

946
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,624
You want me to wait until next year?

947
01:08:22,541 --> 01:08:24,499
I've been fooled before.

948
01:08:25,791 --> 01:08:27,624
I've got nothing to lose.

949
01:08:28,166 --> 01:08:30,749
I'll tell the truth,
place my bet with the courts.

950
01:08:30,833 --> 01:08:33,332
This is a very important time right now.

951
01:08:33,583 --> 01:08:34,749
Be the patriot that -

952
01:08:34,833 --> 01:08:37,290
Don't talk to me about patriotism!

953
01:08:39,375 --> 01:08:41,915
I haven't had a single night of sleep here.

954
01:08:43,833 --> 01:08:45,499
Even in the dark,

955
01:08:45,791 --> 01:08:48,915
my ears are filled with screams.

956
01:08:50,666 --> 01:08:54,165
Screams of those I hurt over the years!

957
01:08:54,541 --> 01:08:59,207
Do you honestly think we're patriots?

958
01:09:03,041 --> 01:09:04,415
You ungrateful bastard!

959
01:09:09,583 --> 01:09:10,957
Back off!

960
01:09:14,291 --> 01:09:16,707
I'll put a goddamn bullet in your face!

961
01:09:18,333 --> 01:09:19,582
Do it.

962
01:09:20,416 --> 01:09:21,874
Shoot me!

963
01:09:27,958 --> 01:09:30,915
No, I have a better idea.

964
01:09:32,041 --> 01:09:36,707
I'm going to throw your wife and children
in the Imjin River.

965
01:09:37,083 --> 01:09:40,082
I'll say they tried to cross into North Korea.

966
01:09:40,625 --> 01:09:42,915
You know exactly how it's done.

967
01:09:43,666 --> 01:09:48,124
I'll make you live the rest of your life
in agonizing Hell.

968
01:09:50,375 --> 01:09:51,374
Director...

969
01:09:54,125 --> 01:09:55,582
Now choose.

970
01:09:56,541 --> 01:09:58,499
Patriot or traitor?

971
01:10:02,041 --> 01:10:04,082
I'll do as you say, sir.

972
01:10:04,625 --> 01:10:08,124
I'll do what you want!

973
01:10:18,375 --> 01:10:21,540
Director, this is far
beyond prison regulations.

974
01:10:22,041 --> 01:10:24,249
Per regulations, visitors cannot -

975
01:10:28,208 --> 01:10:31,874
come in physical contact with inmates.

976
01:10:47,375 --> 01:10:49,332
You're trying real hard.

977
01:10:51,041 --> 01:10:53,165
Take your boys out to drink.

978
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:05,165
Get in that line.

979
01:11:06,500 --> 01:11:07,874
Pass.

980
01:11:11,083 --> 01:11:12,665
Your student ID number?

981
01:11:13,958 --> 01:11:15,874
871 1 023

982
01:11:16,875 --> 01:11:18,957
I never got stopped before.

983
01:11:19,083 --> 01:11:20,999
Seriously, do I look like an activist?

984
01:11:21,166 --> 01:11:25,207
You kinda look like one today.

985
01:11:25,291 --> 01:11:27,790
The perfect match for your protesting knight.

986
01:11:29,041 --> 01:11:31,999
I told you, he's not an activist.

987
01:11:32,791 --> 01:11:35,874
Are you kidding me? Of course, he is.

988
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,540
Anyway, he probably won't even recognize you.

989
01:11:38,625 --> 01:11:41,415
Unless your makeup is all smeared.

990
01:11:41,708 --> 01:11:44,874
-Want me to smudge it?
-Cut it out.

991
01:11:45,291 --> 01:11:50,915
Learn from me,
and carry your books in your arms like this.

992
01:11:51,125 --> 01:11:56,415
Innocent. Girlish. A college goddess.

993
01:12:00,416 --> 01:12:03,082
It's pathetic hiding your breasts behind books.

994
01:12:05,208 --> 01:12:08,749
There's no shame in having small breasts.

995
01:12:10,791 --> 01:12:14,165
I don't have small boobs!

996
01:12:17,583 --> 01:12:18,874
Holy crap!

997
01:12:20,250 --> 01:12:21,707
That's him?

998
01:12:24,583 --> 01:12:27,707
Communist or not, he's totally hot.

999
01:12:28,375 --> 01:12:29,415
Oh, no!

1000
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:30,915
He actually recognized you.

1001
01:12:32,833 --> 01:12:33,999
Smile.

1002
01:12:34,916 --> 01:12:36,665
Hi! You're a freshman?

1003
01:12:37,041 --> 01:12:37,957
Yes...

1004
01:12:38,041 --> 01:12:39,374
You can skip the intros.

1005
01:12:39,458 --> 01:12:41,332
It's not like you haven't met.

1006
01:12:43,041 --> 01:12:44,207
Oh, okay...

1007
01:12:44,416 --> 01:12:46,832
We're holding a video screening

1008
01:12:47,166 --> 01:12:48,415
if you wanna come.

1009
01:12:48,500 --> 01:12:49,457
Sorry?

1010
01:12:49,625 --> 01:12:51,790
We'll draw caricatures afterwards.

1011
01:12:54,458 --> 01:12:55,957
Sure. We'll be there.

1012
01:12:56,291 --> 01:13:01,707
By the way, nice sneakers. Are they new?

1013
01:13:05,375 --> 01:13:06,457
They're cheap though.

1014
01:13:08,666 --> 01:13:10,457
Thanks. See ya!

1015
01:13:17,458 --> 01:13:19,582
He doesn't recognize you at all.

1016
01:13:19,625 --> 01:13:22,040
He said they were cheap stuff.

1017
01:13:28,458 --> 01:13:29,582
I'm not going.

1018
01:13:29,666 --> 01:13:31,290
It's okay. He doesn't even know you.

1019
01:13:31,333 --> 01:13:34,207
I said I'm not going.

1020
01:13:38,250 --> 01:13:39,582
Okay, okay.

1021
01:13:39,666 --> 01:13:42,790
What...you're putting on makeup?

1022
01:13:45,458 --> 01:13:46,749
You're so annoying, you know that?

1023
01:13:46,791 --> 01:13:47,457
Welcome.

1024
01:13:47,500 --> 01:13:48,915
Please take a seat.

1025
01:13:54,458 --> 01:13:55,957
Shall we start?

1026
01:14:01,125 --> 01:14:02,790
Thank you for coming out.

1027
01:14:02,833 --> 01:14:05,624
We'll start the screening shortly.

1028
01:14:05,708 --> 01:14:06,957
What kind of movie is it?

1029
01:14:07,208 --> 01:14:09,790
It's a documentary. From abroad.

1030
01:14:10,833 --> 01:14:13,915
You all know about the Gwangju Uprising?

1031
01:14:15,375 --> 01:14:18,665
The truth is in here.

1032
01:15:40,958 --> 01:15:44,415
The first time I saw it,
I couldn't finish either.

1033
01:15:47,916 --> 01:15:49,957
I was so shocked -

1034
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,874
Why are you showing this at a cartoon club?

1035
01:15:53,041 --> 01:15:55,207
What're you gonna do?

1036
01:15:55,583 --> 01:15:57,582
Fight the army?

1037
01:15:57,708 --> 01:16:03,665
If someone else dies,
who will be responsible then?

1038
01:16:09,916 --> 01:16:13,124
We've interrogated 22 men
about Kim Jung-nam's hideout,

1039
01:16:13,541 --> 01:16:15,874
but no luck so far.

1040
01:16:15,875 --> 01:16:16,749
"Kim Jung-soo"

1041
01:16:17,500 --> 01:16:20,415
You're sparing your bones?

1042
01:16:20,791 --> 01:16:21,915
"Kim Jung-nam's cousin"

1043
01:16:21,916 --> 01:16:23,874
I'm sorry but the boys' morale

1044
01:16:24,458 --> 01:16:26,457
isn't like before.

1045
01:16:29,291 --> 01:16:30,332
Attention!

1046
01:16:38,750 --> 01:16:39,999
This is Director Park.

1047
01:16:40,083 --> 01:16:41,624
Turn on the TV.

1048
01:16:41,916 --> 01:16:43,957
Presidential conference is starting soon.

1049
01:16:44,125 --> 01:16:45,165
Yes sir.

1050
01:16:45,375 --> 01:16:49,124
The President is waiting for
Kim Jung-nam's arrest.

1051
01:16:49,916 --> 01:16:52,082
Prove these political dissidents
are North Korean spies

1052
01:16:52,125 --> 01:16:54,707
and make Park Jong-chul case go away.

1053
01:16:55,166 --> 01:16:57,290
That's our only hope.

1054
01:16:57,500 --> 01:16:59,582
And your last chance.

1055
01:17:01,833 --> 01:17:03,915
"The Blue House"

1056
01:17:07,750 --> 01:17:09,457
Release them all.

1057
01:17:10,833 --> 01:17:14,749
At a time like this,
we gotta bring in more, not release them.

1058
01:17:14,833 --> 01:17:17,874
When I was living in the North,

1059
01:17:18,583 --> 01:17:21,040
I had a dog that used to run away.

1060
01:17:22,041 --> 01:17:24,415
You wanna know how I always found it?

1061
01:17:28,083 --> 01:17:30,915
I'd go for a walk with a female dog in heat.

1062
01:17:31,541 --> 01:17:36,582
Without fail, the runaway dog
would come out running and drooling.

1063
01:17:38,666 --> 01:17:40,290
I've decided that

1064
01:17:40,750 --> 01:17:44,707
it is impossible to revise the constitution
during my term.

1065
01:17:44,708 --> 01:17:45,915
"9:00AM Apr 1 3, 1 987"

1066
01:17:45,916 --> 01:17:47,999
"Declaration of prohibition
on constitutional debate"

1067
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,374
In order to assure
a peaceful transition of power...

1068
01:17:52,250 --> 01:17:54,957
Kim can't help but crawl out of his hole now.

1069
01:17:55,791 --> 01:17:58,707
Use his bitches as baits.

1070
01:17:59,583 --> 01:18:00,665
As you command, sir.

1071
01:18:02,541 --> 01:18:03,832
Follow me.

1072
01:18:07,541 --> 01:18:12,165
...and those who seek to divide the nation...

1073
01:18:12,208 --> 01:18:14,874
That's bullshit. How can he do this?

1074
01:18:15,708 --> 01:18:18,540
Direct election is out of question.

1075
01:18:18,625 --> 01:18:21,582
This is a blatant extension of dictatorship.

1076
01:18:21,666 --> 01:18:22,832
What does this mean for us?

1077
01:18:22,916 --> 01:18:25,165
Get ready to be busy as hell.

1078
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:29,457
Politics! Current Affairs! Gather up!

1079
01:18:33,333 --> 01:18:34,499
What does this mean?

1080
01:18:34,583 --> 01:18:37,749
He will choose the next President himself.

1081
01:18:38,041 --> 01:18:40,124
Fuck! One more soju here.

1082
01:18:40,208 --> 01:18:42,290
-Coming up.
-No, we're good.

1083
01:18:44,375 --> 01:18:46,832
You have a trial in an hour.

1084
01:18:50,041 --> 01:18:51,624
Fuck trial.

1085
01:18:52,625 --> 01:18:55,999
So he's gonna rule for another 7 years?

1086
01:18:56,083 --> 01:18:57,624
Not just 7. He'll hold power as long

1087
01:18:57,708 --> 01:19:00,582
He'll hold power
as long as they hold elections in the gym.

1088
01:19:00,666 --> 01:19:02,499
What's that mean?

1089
01:19:02,583 --> 01:19:05,249
Indirect elections, you dumb ass.

1090
01:19:05,333 --> 01:19:08,207
How did you get into college, man?

1091
01:19:08,750 --> 01:19:10,999
Goddamn fixed game.

1092
01:19:12,541 --> 01:19:13,915
What're you doing?

1093
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:15,665
Something...anything.

1094
01:19:16,083 --> 01:19:17,832
Let me help. What're you thinking?

1095
01:19:18,208 --> 01:19:20,374
Fire up the printing press.

1096
01:19:33,416 --> 01:19:35,832
I gotta go out for a moment, Abbot.

1097
01:19:37,541 --> 01:19:39,374
It's too risky now.

1098
01:19:43,041 --> 01:19:48,332
What's the point of a direct election anyway?

1099
01:19:48,333 --> 01:19:51,332
This country isn't ready for democracy.

1100
01:19:52,833 --> 01:19:54,707
Get ready for your shifts!

1101
01:20:08,750 --> 01:20:12,665
I've got all of your backs.

1102
01:20:14,541 --> 01:20:19,749
Go out and find every commie supporter
you can find.

1103
01:20:20,625 --> 01:20:22,457
Eradicate them!

1104
01:20:22,666 --> 01:20:26,374
Eradicate communism!

1105
01:20:31,708 --> 01:20:34,540
We released Kim Jung-nam's bitches.

1106
01:20:40,333 --> 01:20:41,749
Prisoner 4789!

1107
01:20:43,875 --> 01:20:45,207
Request for meeting.

1108
01:20:49,125 --> 01:20:50,499
In here.

1109
01:21:11,375 --> 01:21:14,582
"Visitor's log Dialogue summary"

1110
01:21:15,291 --> 01:21:17,624
I had to write some of them from memory.

1111
01:21:21,041 --> 01:21:24,582
This is all I can do.

1112
01:21:32,875 --> 01:21:35,665
You have until morning call.

1113
01:21:58,916 --> 01:22:00,332
Stop there.

1114
01:22:03,625 --> 01:22:05,082
Me?

1115
01:22:05,708 --> 01:22:08,499
No rest for the weary, right?

1116
01:22:09,125 --> 01:22:12,457
I'm with the Ministry of Justice.

1117
01:22:15,375 --> 01:22:17,957
That's just my magazine.

1118
01:22:18,041 --> 01:22:19,332
You're a prison guard?

1119
01:22:19,625 --> 01:22:22,874
You look more like...

1120
01:22:23,375 --> 01:22:26,540
Like I belong on the other side of the bars.

1121
01:22:26,791 --> 01:22:31,999
I think the prisoners
leave a stink on me or something.

1122
01:22:32,875 --> 01:22:33,790
What's this?

1123
01:22:33,875 --> 01:22:37,290
I got it to help pass time.

1124
01:22:39,541 --> 01:22:40,207
Pass.

1125
01:22:40,291 --> 01:22:42,374
Thank you, officers.

1126
01:22:44,625 --> 01:22:48,665
-Nothing like the tabloid to kill time.
-Digest is better.

1127
01:22:48,875 --> 01:22:50,665
The Readers' Digest.

1128
01:22:59,625 --> 01:23:01,749
Bitch #6 just left the temple.

1129
01:23:01,916 --> 01:23:03,415
I thought Kim was Catholic.

1130
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:05,040
So did I.

1131
01:23:05,958 --> 01:23:07,165
Go check it out.

1132
01:23:10,958 --> 01:23:12,790
You take the back.

1133
01:23:13,791 --> 01:23:15,999
Shouldn't we report it first?

1134
01:23:16,083 --> 01:23:20,999
Do you want someone else
to get the credit? Go on.

1135
01:24:06,625 --> 01:24:07,957
Target spotted!

1136
01:24:08,041 --> 01:24:09,874
Repeat, target spotted!

1137
01:24:39,333 --> 01:24:41,915
Around the back.
He's wearing workman's clothes.

1138
01:24:51,375 --> 01:24:53,165
I swear he was here.

1139
01:24:55,333 --> 01:24:56,457
Hey.

1140
01:24:57,041 --> 01:24:58,290
Get up there.

1141
01:25:12,333 --> 01:25:13,915
Where the fuck did he go?

1142
01:25:23,458 --> 01:25:25,540
Confirm position of the target.

1143
01:25:26,083 --> 01:25:28,540
He's not here.

1144
01:25:37,250 --> 01:25:38,540
Goddammit!

1145
01:26:10,458 --> 01:26:12,624
Get your asses up here. Now!

1146
01:26:12,708 --> 01:26:14,124
For crying out loud.

1147
01:26:30,375 --> 01:26:31,707
I'm sorry, sir.

1148
01:26:45,541 --> 01:26:46,874
Director!

1149
01:26:50,708 --> 01:26:52,665
Did Mr. Kim evacuate to safety?

1150
01:26:52,750 --> 01:26:55,290
He managed to give them a slip.

1151
01:26:56,333 --> 01:26:57,832
Thank goodness for that.

1152
01:26:57,916 --> 01:26:59,624
He's taking refuge in Hyanglim Church for now.

1153
01:26:59,708 --> 01:27:00,540
I know the place.

1154
01:27:00,625 --> 01:27:01,374
I'll visit him there...

1155
01:27:01,458 --> 01:27:02,749
No, no...

1156
01:27:02,833 --> 01:27:03,665
I'm home.

1157
01:27:03,750 --> 01:27:06,707
No, it'd be too risky for you
to contact him now.

1158
01:27:06,791 --> 01:27:07,665
Where's mom?

1159
01:27:07,750 --> 01:27:10,124
Jung-nam's statement will not have any effect

1160
01:27:10,208 --> 01:27:12,165
without that information.

1161
01:27:14,333 --> 01:27:15,457
Wait.

1162
01:27:15,916 --> 01:27:18,874
All our people are under heavy surveillance.

1163
01:27:19,625 --> 01:27:22,582
I'll find another way to pass on the message.

1164
01:27:36,625 --> 01:27:37,749
Yeon-hee.

1165
01:27:39,125 --> 01:27:40,249
Yeon-hee!

1166
01:27:41,500 --> 01:27:42,790
You scared me.

1167
01:27:44,750 --> 01:27:45,707
What do you want?

1168
01:27:54,500 --> 01:27:55,957
I'm not doing it.

1169
01:27:56,250 --> 01:27:58,874
I swear this is the last time.

1170
01:27:59,291 --> 01:28:00,165
It's important.

1171
01:28:00,250 --> 01:28:01,332
He needs to see this.

1172
01:28:01,375 --> 01:28:03,290
What's the point? Only you'll end up hurt.

1173
01:28:03,375 --> 01:28:06,790
How can I do nothing
when there's something I can do?

1174
01:28:12,041 --> 01:28:15,249
I'm not alone in this.
There are people working together.

1175
01:28:15,541 --> 01:28:17,874
Don't you know how my father died?

1176
01:28:19,208 --> 01:28:22,332
All his colleagues ran away
at the first sign of trouble.

1177
01:28:22,416 --> 01:28:25,499
He stood up for what was right.

1178
01:28:25,583 --> 01:28:28,082
The company that didn't pay the wages
should be blamed.

1179
01:28:28,166 --> 01:28:30,082
Not the others.

1180
01:28:30,166 --> 01:28:31,332
He didn't start drinking

1181
01:28:31,375 --> 01:28:33,124
because of the company.

1182
01:28:33,875 --> 01:28:38,249
He drank because of the people that
betrayed him.

1183
01:28:39,291 --> 01:28:40,540
Yeon-hee.

1184
01:28:42,208 --> 01:28:44,290
It was an accident.

1185
01:28:44,500 --> 01:28:46,124
It was no one's fault.

1186
01:28:46,208 --> 01:28:47,749
Bullshit!

1187
01:28:49,833 --> 01:28:52,582
If they hadn't abandoned him...

1188
01:28:57,958 --> 01:29:00,040
He wouldn't have died.

1189
01:29:01,708 --> 01:29:03,415
You can take this back.

1190
01:29:20,875 --> 01:29:21,832
It's 25 cents.

1191
01:29:21,916 --> 01:29:23,249
You're 5 cents short.

1192
01:29:30,500 --> 01:29:32,374
Go on, have a good life.

1193
01:29:34,458 --> 01:29:36,290
Careful, dears.

1194
01:29:36,750 --> 01:29:39,457
Where's your uncle?

1195
01:29:39,791 --> 01:29:41,249
I don't know.

1196
01:29:41,541 --> 01:29:43,874
Byung-Yong!

1197
01:29:44,541 --> 01:29:47,665
Help me move the stalls inside.

1198
01:29:50,500 --> 01:29:52,124
Did you two fight?

1199
01:29:52,291 --> 01:29:53,790
Of course not.

1200
01:29:56,041 --> 01:30:00,124
How many times do I have to tell you?

1201
01:30:00,333 --> 01:30:02,999
He's practically a father to you.

1202
01:30:03,958 --> 01:30:05,624
Oh my god!

1203
01:30:07,583 --> 01:30:08,624
Who are you people?

1204
01:30:08,666 --> 01:30:10,665
You little rat!

1205
01:30:10,750 --> 01:30:11,790
Byung-Yong!

1206
01:30:12,125 --> 01:30:13,582
No, don't!

1207
01:30:13,958 --> 01:30:17,165
-Get off me.
-Help!

1208
01:30:18,500 --> 01:30:19,749
Get off of me.

1209
01:30:20,583 --> 01:30:21,915
Come here.

1210
01:30:28,958 --> 01:30:30,040
Stop!

1211
01:30:30,541 --> 01:30:32,249
What's going on?

1212
01:30:32,333 --> 01:30:34,374
-I didn't do...
-Shut up!

1213
01:30:35,083 --> 01:30:36,790
Take him!

1214
01:30:40,791 --> 01:30:41,624
No!

1215
01:30:41,708 --> 01:30:43,415
Search the place.

1216
01:30:44,666 --> 01:30:46,749
Byung-Yong!

1217
01:30:46,916 --> 01:30:49,332
I'm okay. Don't worry.

1218
01:30:49,500 --> 01:30:50,624
-Uncle!
-Byung-Yong!

1219
01:30:50,666 --> 01:30:52,332
-Yeon-hee!
-Uncle!

1220
01:30:57,166 --> 01:30:59,124
How can they do this?

1221
01:31:06,333 --> 01:31:09,082
Did you see my men at the prison?

1222
01:31:11,333 --> 01:31:12,999
I've seen them a couple of times.

1223
01:31:20,500 --> 01:31:23,665
Do you know Kim Jung-Nam?

1224
01:31:25,958 --> 01:31:27,832
I don't know who that is.

1225
01:31:30,750 --> 01:31:35,124
Kim Jung-Nam received money from Kim ll-sung

1226
01:31:35,625 --> 01:31:38,332
and split it with the opposition leaders,

1227
01:31:39,833 --> 01:31:41,040
correct?

1228
01:31:41,500 --> 01:31:44,415
I...don't know that man.

1229
01:31:50,750 --> 01:31:52,499
"KIM JUNG-NAM SPY RING"

1230
01:32:05,500 --> 01:32:07,999
I thought you didn't know
who I was talking about.

1231
01:32:09,958 --> 01:32:11,374
Get him out of here.

1232
01:32:13,791 --> 01:32:14,915
Two cushions?

1233
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,957
I'll show you how it's done.

1234
01:32:30,916 --> 01:32:32,290
Goal!

1235
01:32:36,916 --> 01:32:41,790
This room's got a history. A bad history.

1236
01:32:42,041 --> 01:32:45,082
So let's finish quickly
and walk out of here alive, okay?

1237
01:32:53,500 --> 01:32:54,957
Evening papers!

1238
01:33:09,208 --> 01:33:10,832
You live high up.

1239
01:33:19,208 --> 01:33:20,832
Why did you come here?

1240
01:33:23,500 --> 01:33:25,624
I came to recruit you, of course.

1241
01:33:26,666 --> 01:33:28,582
Join our cartoon club.

1242
01:33:29,458 --> 01:33:31,124
Jung-mi just joined too.

1243
01:33:35,583 --> 01:33:37,707
We made this at the club.

1244
01:33:38,875 --> 01:33:40,540
"Appeal against dictatorship and torture"

1245
01:33:48,416 --> 01:33:49,999
Are you going to protest?

1246
01:33:55,250 --> 01:33:57,290
You think you can change the world?

1247
01:33:58,125 --> 01:34:01,707
Your ideals and dreams...
Don't you think about your family?

1248
01:34:09,541 --> 01:34:11,374
"When the Day Comes"

1249
01:34:12,333 --> 01:34:14,374
No such day will come.

1250
01:34:16,708 --> 01:34:18,457
Stop dreaming and wake up.

1251
01:34:22,916 --> 01:34:24,957
I wish I could,

1252
01:34:27,916 --> 01:34:29,665
but I can't.

1253
01:34:35,375 --> 01:34:37,374
Because it hurts too much.

1254
01:34:42,541 --> 01:34:43,499
You should go.

1255
01:34:54,250 --> 01:34:55,207
See ya.

1256
01:35:01,500 --> 01:35:02,707
Yeon-hee!

1257
01:35:04,208 --> 01:35:06,290
Call me if you change your mind.

1258
01:35:41,041 --> 01:35:42,415
"Call me."

1259
01:35:42,458 --> 01:35:44,415
"This is my number!"

1260
01:36:07,833 --> 01:36:09,582
"This is the last time."

1261
01:36:09,625 --> 01:36:10,457
"It's really important."

1262
01:36:10,500 --> 01:36:12,249
"Find Kim Jung-Nam at Hyanglim Church. Please."

1263
01:36:24,791 --> 01:36:25,832
Hello?

1264
01:36:25,916 --> 01:36:27,165
Yeon-hee.

1265
01:36:28,833 --> 01:36:30,249
What's wrong, mom?

1266
01:36:30,375 --> 01:36:31,749
What happened?

1267
01:36:31,833 --> 01:36:38,082
Your uncle's been taken by
the same people that killed that student.

1268
01:36:40,916 --> 01:36:43,040
That bastard won't give in.

1269
01:36:43,625 --> 01:36:45,415
Can you do another round?

1270
01:36:49,458 --> 01:36:50,915
We worked him over 7 times,

1271
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:52,290
and he still gave us nothing.

1272
01:36:52,375 --> 01:36:53,999
He's a tenacious bastard, huh?

1273
01:36:54,416 --> 01:36:55,999
Bring me his file.

1274
01:37:05,583 --> 01:37:07,207
What's going on?

1275
01:37:10,958 --> 01:37:12,540
Get out of my way!

1276
01:37:12,916 --> 01:37:15,040
I know he's here.

1277
01:37:15,125 --> 01:37:16,665
I'm here, Byung-Yong!

1278
01:37:17,250 --> 01:37:18,790
Your sister's here!

1279
01:37:24,833 --> 01:37:26,082
Stop them.

1280
01:37:26,375 --> 01:37:27,957
Give my brother back!

1281
01:37:28,041 --> 01:37:29,749
Keep these people out.

1282
01:37:31,708 --> 01:37:33,249
Are you alright?

1283
01:37:35,125 --> 01:37:36,665
Mom! You alright?

1284
01:37:36,750 --> 01:37:40,374
How dare you hit her?

1285
01:37:40,458 --> 01:37:44,540
What are you, some kind of thug?

1286
01:37:46,125 --> 01:37:47,999
Mom, no!

1287
01:37:49,291 --> 01:37:52,415
How dare you hit her?

1288
01:37:56,958 --> 01:37:58,082
Mom!

1289
01:38:10,750 --> 01:38:14,790
Shut up, you bitches!

1290
01:38:16,583 --> 01:38:18,082
To positions!

1291
01:40:43,583 --> 01:40:44,749
Sir!

1292
01:40:48,916 --> 01:40:56,332
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7

1293
01:41:07,125 --> 01:41:15,207
1 , 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

1294
01:41:31,416 --> 01:41:34,332
Do you see this kid standing next to my mother?

1295
01:41:38,500 --> 01:41:40,290
His name is Dong.

1296
01:41:41,791 --> 01:41:44,124
We found him starving to death,

1297
01:41:44,416 --> 01:41:46,457
so my mother took him in.

1298
01:41:47,833 --> 01:41:50,874
He was a bright kid.

1299
01:41:51,708 --> 01:41:54,707
My father took to him like a son.

1300
01:41:56,541 --> 01:41:59,332
He was like an older brother to me.

1301
01:42:03,916 --> 01:42:08,790
But when Kim ll-sung came into North Korea

1302
01:42:09,458 --> 01:42:15,332
Dong got fascinated by the idea
of people's democracy.

1303
01:42:17,458 --> 01:42:22,040
Do you know what he did to my family
in the name of the Red Army?

1304
01:42:24,208 --> 01:42:26,207
He called us the enemy!

1305
01:42:26,458 --> 01:42:28,457
Reactionaries and landowners!

1306
01:42:28,875 --> 01:42:32,040
To be sent to Hell!

1307
01:42:34,708 --> 01:42:36,957
He stabbed my father with a bamboo spear

1308
01:42:39,750 --> 01:42:45,707
saying he shouldn't waste bullets on him.

1309
01:42:47,875 --> 01:42:49,415
Honey!

1310
01:42:52,375 --> 01:42:56,457
I was hiding under the floor
but I saw the whole thing.

1311
01:42:57,708 --> 01:43:04,124
If I had tried to defend my family,
do you think I could have saved my mother?

1312
01:43:07,666 --> 01:43:12,415
I could have saved my sister.
Because she died instead of me.

1313
01:43:13,333 --> 01:43:14,957
Brother!

1314
01:43:21,125 --> 01:43:26,790
Do you want to know what Hell is?

1315
01:43:30,708 --> 01:43:33,499
It's someone murdering your family

1316
01:43:34,458 --> 01:43:36,915
while you stand helplessly by and watch.

1317
01:43:38,166 --> 01:43:40,540
Not able to make a sound.

1318
01:43:42,333 --> 01:43:44,124
That's Hell.

1319
01:43:57,625 --> 01:43:59,249
What will you do?

1320
01:44:35,250 --> 01:44:36,707
I'm sorry.

1321
01:44:37,750 --> 01:44:43,165
Please don't let them hurt my uncle.

1322
01:44:49,833 --> 01:44:52,749
Thank you for believing in me.

1323
01:45:06,708 --> 01:45:10,290
Father, the Pigeon has finally sent post.

1324
01:45:16,291 --> 01:45:20,665
"...3 more detectives involved in the murder."

1325
01:45:47,375 --> 01:45:48,707
Hello.

1326
01:45:53,708 --> 01:45:54,790
Pastor! Pastor!

1327
01:45:55,333 --> 01:45:58,124
Get away from here, Pastor!

1328
01:46:02,541 --> 01:46:05,374
Get in there! Find him.

1329
01:46:08,125 --> 01:46:09,332
Come on.

1330
01:46:12,125 --> 01:46:13,790
-Run, hurry.
-But Pastor...

1331
01:46:13,875 --> 01:46:15,165
Come on.

1332
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:23,874
This is a place of God!

1333
01:46:23,958 --> 01:46:25,624
Violence will not be tolerated here.

1334
01:46:26,541 --> 01:46:28,207
What are you doing?

1335
01:46:30,708 --> 01:46:32,332
Where is Kim Jung-Nam?

1336
01:47:01,625 --> 01:47:03,749
Get him.

1337
01:47:10,916 --> 01:47:12,040
Hurry.

1338
01:47:29,375 --> 01:47:30,999
Open it.

1339
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:35,874
"Memorial service for the victims of Gwangju"

1340
01:47:35,916 --> 01:47:38,165

"11:30AM May 18, 1987"

1343
01:47:41,166 --> 01:47:43,332
we'll make an important announcement

1344
01:47:43,541 --> 01:47:45,457

01:48:00,500 --> 01:48:08,915
The truth behind the death of Park Jong-chul
was covered up by authorities.

1348
01:48:09,458 --> 01:48:14,165
The persons responsible for his murder
are in fact...

1349
01:48:14,750 --> 01:48:23,040
Inspector Cho Han-kyung,
Anti-communist Division 2-5-2-1

Hold him properly, dammit!

1356
01:48:58,958 --> 01:49:02,332
Jong-chul, do you know where you are?

1357
01:49:04,125 --> 01:49:06,790
Even if you die here, no one will ever know.

1358
01:49:09,125 --> 01:49:11,207
So just tell us where he is.

1359
01:49:15,958 --> 01:49:17,540
I really don't know.

1360
01:49:18,833 --> 01:49:20,540
I swear.

1361
01:49:24,083 --> 01:49:26,624
Looks like we'll hear the end
of our national anthem.

1362
01:49:27,083 --> 01:49:28,165
Fourth verse.

1363
01:49:28,250 --> 01:49:30,624
Stop saying you don't know.

1364
01:49:30,708 --> 01:49:31,540
No!

1365
01:49:31,625 --> 01:49:32,499
No, please!

1366
01:49:32,583 --> 01:49:34,457
Get up, you bastard!

1367
01:49:36,208 --> 01:49:37,915

01:50:09,291 --> 01:50:11,582

Inspector Hwang Jung-woong.

1377
01:51:02,833 --> 01:51:04,249
He's not here.

1378
01:51:05,458 --> 01:51:06,832
Let's go.

1379
01:51:40,791 --> 01:51:42,124

The meeting will be
at the Commissioner's office?

01:52:09,958 --> 01:52:11,290
Yes sir.

1384
01:52:16,250 --> 01:52:17,707
Burn it all.

Everything.

1386
01:52:20,875 --> 01:52:21,665
Hurry up!

1387
01:52:21,750 --> 01:52:23,040
Hurry, guys!

1388
01:52:39,083 --> 01:52:41,790
-Let's hit the bar after work.
-Sounds good.

1389
01:52:41,875 --> 01:52:43,790
Inspector Hwang.

1390
01:52:43,875 --> 01:52:45,915
What brings you here?

1391
01:52:47,333 --> 01:52:48,749
Long time no see.

1392
01:52:51,958 --> 01:52:52,832
Goddammit!

1393
01:52:52,916 --> 01:52:54,124
You bastards!

1394
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,165
Let go of me!

1395
01:53:04,291 --> 01:53:06,249
Get them out of here.

1396
01:53:06,375 --> 01:53:07,124
Goddammit!

1397
01:53:12,625 --> 01:53:16,040
Did you know
there were 5 officers involved in the torture?

1398
01:53:16,125 --> 01:53:16,957
I have no idea.

1399
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:18,165
How can you not know?

1400
01:53:18,250 --> 01:53:19,707
ls this part of a cover-up?

1401
01:53:19,791 --> 01:53:21,582
I said I know nothing of it.

1402
01:53:21,625 --> 01:53:22,999
The order came from above, didn't it?

1403
01:53:23,041 --> 01:53:24,249
Shut up, you commie!

1404
01:53:24,333 --> 01:53:26,040
Any comments, Director?

1405
01:53:26,916 --> 01:53:29,165
You paid the officers
$1 00,000 to take the fall!

1406
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:31,707
I secured the families' testimonies.

1407
01:53:32,083 --> 01:53:33,749
Where did you get the money?

1408
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:37,040
Cover up of torture, murder,
fabrication of evidence.

1409
01:53:37,291 --> 01:53:38,707
