00:00:04,594 --> 00:00:10,594
A Team Nanban (594mgnav) Release

1
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:36,048
Wake up, come on.
We're in Milan.

2
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:39,009
Get up, Luca, we're here.

3
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:42,679
At last!

4
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:47,351
Come on, Mama.

5
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:51,521
Are you tired?

6
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,532
Rocco, the basket.

7
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:19,007
You got everything, Mama?

8
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:22,678
- Tired?
- You're sure you have everything?

9
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:24,972
- Where's Vincenzo?
- I don't know.

10
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:28,392
- Why isn't he here yet?
- Maybe he's outside.

11
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:30,978
Why isn't Vincenzo here?

12
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:35,274
- Why isn't Vincenzo here?
- I can't see, you look.

13
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:37,192
Here!

14
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,029
Want me to look for him?

15
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:43,740
- Don't get lost.
- I won't.

16
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:01,800
There's nobody here.

17
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:47,971
How beautiful!

18
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:54,478
- Ciro, look how nice it is!
- Big, isn't it?

19
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:02,110
Rocco, what a city!

20
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:07,115
Look at all those shops
and the lights.

21
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:10,786
It's like daylight.

22
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,829
Excuse me...

23
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:18,168
What's the nearest stop
to this address?

24
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:21,046
- It's the last stop.
- Last stop?

25
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:24,132
Last stop, end of the line.
At Lambrate.

26
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,885
- Lambrate?
- Get off at Lambrate.

27
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:30,597
- He's my son.
- Your son?

28
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:32,766
- The oldest.
- Ah, the oldest.

29
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:35,185
We're going to visit him.

30
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,524
Let's toast the fiancés!

31
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:43,110
Best wishes! All the best!

32
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:49,408
One always ends up drinking
too much at these parties.

33
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:54,788
Here we are!

34
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:57,040
Thank you, thank you.

35
00:06:57,125 --> 00:07:00,001
They've decided on their own.

36
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:02,838
Parents don't count anymore nowadays.

37
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,675
Well, we had to start sometime.

38
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:12,973
Besides, I don't feel
like going back down there.

39
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:17,102
I want to raise my family here.

40
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:19,771
Why don't you get married as well?

41
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:24,151
Me? Only my sister's
dumb enough to do that!

42
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:32,492
He's worried about supporting us,

43
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:35,078
but we'll manage on our own.

44
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:38,081
- That's right.
- Right, Vincenzo?

45
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:42,794
Thank you.

46
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:53,638
- We're not looking for anything.
- Oh, Lord! Please...

47
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:56,057
That'll be Aldo.

48
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:58,393
I'm off to the cinema. Bye.

49
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,104
- Have fun!
- Bye, everyone!

50
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:05,358
- Bye, Ma.
- Bye. Have fun.

51
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:08,570
Thank you.

52
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:11,823
Always the cinema!
He lives on bread and movies!

53
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:14,034
It's a fixation with him.

54
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:18,413
I went along too, on Sunday
and immediately fell asleep!

55
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:25,212
Good evening.
Do the Giannellis live here?

56
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:27,881
I'm Mrs Parondi.

57
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:30,217
Vincenzo,
come and see who's here.

58
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:32,594
- Come in, come in.
- Thank you.

59
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:37,933
Mama!

60
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:41,144
Oh, my son, my son...

61
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:46,066
Hey, Luca, how are you?

62
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:53,865
Rosaria, dear Rosaria!

63
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:59,496
And your family?
Oh, God bless you!

64
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,499
This is Rosaria, everybody.

65
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:05,168
So these are your brothers?

66
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:07,212
- This is Luca.
- Hello.

67
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:10,632
- Simone. This is my fiancée.
- Hello.

68
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:12,300
- Rocco...
- Hello.

69
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,010
- ...and Ciro.
- Hello.

70
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:16,596
Leave everything here
and come inside.

71
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:18,515
Come in.

72
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,935
Come inside.

73
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:24,896
It's Vincenzo's mother!

74
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:29,359
What a long trip.
Offer her some wine.

75
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:33,530
Come on in, boys! Come on in!

76
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:38,451
Offer them some wine,
they must be freezing.

77
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:42,080
Handsome boys, aren't they?
The picture of their mother.

78
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:44,457
Ginetta, pass the biscuits around.

79
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:47,919
Really handsome boys.
You must be tired.

80
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:51,506
It's true, they're all so similar.

81
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:54,676
They must be exhausted
after such a long trip.

82
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:58,597
- What a nice surprise!
- What's in there?

83
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:04,436
What misfortune we've had,
my dear son.

84
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:13,403
But what is this? Aren't you
in mourning for your father?

85
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:16,698
No... well, it's just that...

86
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:21,286
This is Ginetta. I wrote to you
about our engagement.

87
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:24,623
You arrived just in time
to give us your blessing.

88
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:29,169
Marriage?
You're rich enough to get married?

89
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:33,548
Especially now, with your whole family
dependent on you?

90
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:40,388
- If only you'd written to let me know.
- We did write!

91
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:44,184
Yes, but that was when
Papa had just died.

92
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:49,272
I told you then,
"First I have to find them a job"

93
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:51,983
It's not that easy here in Milan...

94
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:55,779
- Have a seat, please.
- Make yourselves comfortable.

95
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:59,074
- Tell us about yourselves.
- Let's hear all about you.

96
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,534
Just make yourself at home.

97
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:06,039
- Ah, he's shy!
- You're just probably tired.

98
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:08,583
- No.
- No? That's youth for you!

99
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,585
It must be cold for you in Milan.

100
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:14,339
- No.
- Help yourself to some candy.

101
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:17,550
And what have you got there?

102
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,594
- Oranges.
- Oranges?

103
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,013
Amelia!
Oranges from our hometown!

104
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:24,224
- Would you like one?
- Thank you.

105
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:28,812
Oh, the smell! The smell!

106
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:32,065
Thank you.

107
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:36,111
Listen, Rosaria, I thought
you'd come for their engagement.

108
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:42,575
And Vincenzo said nothing
because he wanted to surprise us.

109
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:46,871
But my heart's too heavy
to think about parties.

110
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:51,292
But listen, you came here
straight from the station?

111
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,211
Yes.

112
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:57,215
So where are you going to sleep
tonight? We've no room here.

113
00:11:58,175 --> 00:12:01,845
My son won't leave us
out on the street.

114
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:04,848
He'll take good care of us.

115
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:08,518
Listen, Rosaria. I'll be frank with you.

116
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:13,106
I can understand you being
worried about your boys,

117
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:17,360
but I have my daughter to think of.
She comes first!

118
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:22,157
She turns up just like that
and ruins everything!

119
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:25,034
- Mama, what are you saying?
- Your mother's right.

120
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:27,620
- You don't understand.
- I'm nobody's fool!

121
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:29,789
- Don't shout!
- Mama's right!

122
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:33,001
Let's get out of this house!
Rocco! Simone!

123
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:36,004
- Mama, no!
- You're all crazy!

124
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:40,550
- Come to your mother.
- I'm not crazy. I understand, all right.

125
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:44,846
They want to keep you
from helping your mother.

126
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:48,850
They've no respect
for your dead father! Heathens!

127
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:50,393
"Heathen"?

128
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:53,980
- Let's get out of here!
- No, no.

129
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:57,400
- Quiet, you, you're one of them.
- Mama...

130
00:12:57,485 --> 00:13:02,197
- Let's go, boys. Bring this.
- No, please...

131
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:05,825
God will punish you,
for He judges everyone.

132
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:08,536
No, wait.
They didn't mean to offend you.

133
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:11,998
- Gina, come on.
- Let go of me! Let go!

134
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:14,292
- Leave her alone.
- I'm not afraid of you!

135
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:17,253
Go on, get out of my house!

136
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:21,674
Hear that? What are you waiting for?
Come on!

137
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:24,928
Get out and stay out!

138
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:34,187
Armando!

139
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:38,900
Armando!

140
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:42,529
Eh? Who is it?

141
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:45,156
It's Vincenzo. Let me in.

142
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:50,870
What's wrong?
What are you doing here so late?

143
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:52,997
I'll explain later.

144
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:55,750
Hurry up! It's cold!

145
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:03,341
So what are you doing here
at this hour?

146
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:09,222
To get some sleep, if possible.
It's almost dawn already.

147
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:12,350
Let's hear it then,
what have you done?

148
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:15,228
Nothing. I can explain everything.

149
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:17,856
Down, boy, down!

150
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:21,568
Come on in.
You're not afraid of the dogs, are you?

151
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:25,989
There's wood, a stove,
all the comforts.

152
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:30,785
So let's hear your story, then.

153
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:35,915
My whole family turned up unexpectedly,
like an earthquake!

154
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,961
And then they started arguing
with my future in-laws.

155
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:44,299
I had to give up my room,
my fiancée and everything.

156
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:49,679
For you, a room and a fiancée
are one and the same?

157
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:52,807
- It's no joke.
- No.

158
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:55,727
How can I support
my whole family?

159
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:59,147
Where will they stay?

160
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:01,774
I found somewhere for them
for tonight,

161
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,985
but tomorrow, God knows!

162
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:10,450
What's the problem?
Milan's full of empty houses.

163
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:13,995
Apartment buildings are shooting up
like mushrooms!

164
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:18,124
- And what about the rent?
- Listen to me,

165
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:20,376
do what all you Southerners do.

166
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:22,712
- Know what I mean?
- Not exactly...

167
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:25,548
You rent a public
housing apartment

168
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:30,386
and if you can, you pay,
but after a few months you stop paying.

169
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:33,097
- How?
- Just a moment...

170
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:36,267
A month later, they evict you.

171
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:38,019
- How can I...?
- Hang on...

172
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:41,439
Then you join the other evictees
where you pay nothing

173
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:45,360
and there's central heating,
electricity, etc.

174
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:49,739
Milan's community would never leave
anyone on the street.

175
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:54,661
- Couldn't we go straight there?
- No, you have to be evicted first.

176
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:58,206
- I see.
- That's the secret, understand?

177
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:02,001
- Good night.
- Don't be such an idiot.

178
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:18,434
Porter!

179
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:22,105
Porter!

180
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:26,442
I'm Mrs Parondi, open up!

181
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:28,820
- I'm coming! Hold on!
- Open up.

182
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:31,447
I'm coming.

183
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:36,077
- What's the big rush?
- Is this the place?

184
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:38,413
- There you go.
- I'm Rosaria Parondi.

185
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:42,458
Yes, Parondi, it's over there.

186
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:46,879
- Downstairs, on the lower level.
- Come on.

187
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,190
Good morning, Signora Maria.

188
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:09,444
Did you see those dreadful people?
Immigrants!

189
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:11,821
- Where are they from?
- Lucania.

190
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:16,701
- Lucania? Odd name! Where's that?
- Down South.

191
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:20,163
Oh, there? The land of layabouts!

192
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:09,337
Wake up!

193
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:11,589
Ciro, it's snowing!

194
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:15,134
Rocco!
There'll be work for everybody.

195
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:18,012
Simone, it's snowing!

196
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:21,849
What's happened?

197
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:24,102
Look out the window.
Today there'll be work.

198
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:28,272
Snow...
It's sticking to the ground.

199
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:31,526
Luca, look, it's snowing.

200
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,153
- Snow!
- Get up.

201
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:37,115
Get moving or we'll be too late.

202
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:41,244
The Milanese don't like their streets
covered with snow.

203
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:45,581
Come on, sleepyhead, get up!

204
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:50,128
Look, it's snowing! Look!

205
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:54,841
Simone, dear, get up.

206
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:57,802
Look, it's snowing.
How wonderful!

207
00:18:57,886 --> 00:19:01,806
There should be work
for everybody.

208
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:05,560
Look, your brothers
are almost ready to go.

209
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:07,979
Get up, get up!

210
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:10,523
- Get a move on, Rocco.
- We're coming.

211
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:13,609
Simone, come on!

212
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:21,284
Rocco, you've been ill,
so wear one of my shawls.

213
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:23,995
But it's a woman's.

214
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:29,250
They can tease all they want.
Listen to your mother. Put it on.

215
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:31,961
I'll get the breakfast on.

216
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:34,422
Simone.

217
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:37,508
Come on, Simone,
we're working today.

218
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:40,428
- Luca!
- Luca, stop it, you'll make us late.

219
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,850
- Don't fall.
- Off you go!

220
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:49,562
- Hurry up, boys!
- Ciro! Simone!

221
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:53,858
- The coffee's almost ready.
- Here I am.

222
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:59,572
Eat your eggs.
They're fresh and healthy.

223
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:03,451
Come on, the coffee's nice and hot.

224
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:06,162
Put in plenty of bread.

225
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:09,916
Make some for your brothers too.

226
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:15,254
Oh, thank God,
there's work here for everybody!

227
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:18,758
The Lord is merciful,
he sent us the snow.

228
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:21,552
- You wearing my sweater?
- Yes.

229
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:26,849
Good. Simone, dear, hurry. Come on!

230
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:31,479
- Poor thing, he has to go to work.
- It's freezing.

231
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:36,400
You even left the window open!
You get the hot flushes, not me!

232
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:49,997
Hey, come on, the city's
waiting for us, you layabout!

233
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:54,126
He'll never change.
Finish your coffee.

234
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:57,964
I'll get lunch ready.
Luca, bring my bag!

235
00:20:58,048 --> 00:21:00,675
- Yes, Mama.
- No, I'll get it.

236
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:07,390
- Luca, where's my bag?
- It's here, under the bed.

237
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:10,309
- I'll get it for you.
- Hurry up!

238
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:21,070
Come on, here are your coats.

239
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:26,367
Rocco, cover up well. Don't take
any chances, you've been sick.

240
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:29,620
Here, everything's ready.
Come on, hurry!

241
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:35,251
Hey, lazybones,
I'll help you with your coat.

242
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:38,754
Cover up, you loafer.

243
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:46,095
God bless this city.
Happy now?

244
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:49,098
Thank you, Rocco, my angel.

245
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:52,518
- Ah, this coffee's boiling.
- Come on, Ciro.

246
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:55,313
Hurry! It's stopped snowing.

247
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:57,815
There's enough for a day's work.

248
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:02,820
Don't forget your hats, boys.
Hurry it up!

249
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:06,532
Dear God, you can't be late!

250
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:10,244
Hurry, Mama's kicking us out.

251
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,580
- Be quick!
- Coming, Mama.

252
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:15,416
Move, I'm freezing here.

253
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:19,295
- Give me a kiss.
- Ciao.

254
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:22,965
- Ciao, Rocco, God be with you.
- Ciao, Mama.

255
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:26,469
Come on, Ciro. You be careful.

256
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:29,138
Come on, Vincenzo! Work well.

257
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:33,142
By all the saints, if you don't
come back with money,

258
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:36,437
you're no longer the sons
of Rosaria Parondi!

259
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:39,065
- Ciao, Mama!
- Good luck!

260
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:46,906
- Simone!
- Yes?

261
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:49,325
- Are you coming too?
- Where?

262
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:52,620
- To the delegation.
- Where's that?

263
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:54,747
I don't know.

264
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:57,124
Simone, Rocco, hurry!

265
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:39,083
- Ciao.
- Did you see him?

266
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:41,961
Yeah. He's gone now.
How are you?

267
00:23:42,045 --> 00:23:44,588
- You haven't been around.
- I know...

268
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:46,173
- Ciao, Ginetta.
- Ciao.

269
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:50,428
I can explain. Let's go somewhere
where we can talk.

270
00:24:03,024 --> 00:24:06,360
Ginetta, I can't come
to your house anymore,

271
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:09,196
and you're always chaperoned...

272
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:11,449
- Our families are against us.
- Families!

273
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:14,869
- What chance do we have?
- I can only hope.

274
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:18,080
- You're a born optimist.
- Ciao, Ginetta!

275
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:19,915
- Ciao.
- We'll manage.

276
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:23,335
We've got a place now.
Mama says one must take a woman

277
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:27,715
without having to ask
anyone's permission.

278
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:31,469
"Take her"?

279
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:34,138
What's wrong?

280
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:38,934
A real man takes the woman he wants,
without asking permission.

281
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:43,731
With me,
you have to ask every time!

282
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:47,526
- Of course I'll ask...
- Ciao.

283
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:59,705
- You whore! You miserable bitch!
- Shut up! I'm going! I'm going!

284
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:15,471
- What's going on?
- Shh! Quiet!

285
00:25:19,142 --> 00:25:21,977
It's my father.
We don't get along.

286
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,564
Who are you? You live here?

287
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:29,485
Wish I could,
but they don't want me. Hear that?

288
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:31,403
Yeah... But why not?

289
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:35,449
Oh, it's the same old stupid story...

290
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:40,496
- ...you know, a girl's honour and so on.
- I know.

291
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:45,793
They think it's so important.
What's a poor girl to do?

292
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:52,758
Can you imagine if all girls like me
suddenly disappeared?

293
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:54,677
Just imagine it!

294
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:58,681
Yeah. There'd be nothing but men left.

295
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:01,559
To do what?

296
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:08,274
- Hear that?
- What will you do?

297
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:11,110
Run away. What else?

298
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:13,696
Wait.

299
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:21,704
Come inside. Maybe my mother has
something warm for you to wear.

300
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:23,872
You're very sweet.

301
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:28,127
I'm what?

302
00:26:28,211 --> 00:26:30,379
You're sweet.

303
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:32,631
Let's go.

304
00:26:40,223 --> 00:26:42,641
- Where?
- Right there.

305
00:26:47,188 --> 00:26:49,440
Come in.

306
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:52,192
- Is that you, Vincenzo?
- Yes, Ma.

307
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:56,071
- Were they shouting at you?
- No, not at me...

308
00:26:57,449 --> 00:27:01,869
...at this poor girl here,
she's in a bit of trouble.

309
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:06,373
Do you have something
she can cover up with?

310
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:11,295
- A girl?
- Yes, Ma.

311
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:15,674
- Where is she?
- Here, look.

312
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:20,888
- Sorry, if I'm disturbing you.
- Well, close the door, it's freezing!

313
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:27,519
Come in. I don't know
what I can give you.

314
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:29,772
There's your father's old coat.

315
00:27:29,856 --> 00:27:33,025
Whatever, but hurry,
she's shivering.

316
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:34,735
Let's see.

317
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:38,947
Evening.

318
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:40,491
Good evening.

319
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:44,662
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

320
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:49,041
You're all brothers?

321
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:52,878
Yes, we're all brothers.

322
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:02,304
It's much colder down here.

323
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:05,766
You're Milanese?

324
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:11,188
Well, Lombardy.
From Cremona, to be exact.

325
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:12,815
Like the mustard!

326
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:21,865
You're Southerners, right?

327
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:25,703
You're working here?

328
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:29,623
- Today we shovelled snow.
- Good for you!

329
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:34,420
He brought us here.
We've been here a month.

330
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:38,215
Work's hard to find.

331
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:42,219
That's why we shovelled snow
today. Sit down.

332
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:44,388
Thank you so much.

333
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:50,269
Big boys like you should find work
immediately, if that's what you want.

334
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:53,564
- Your family?
- Yeah, I'm in the middle.

335
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:59,445
Oh, yes, you're in the middle.
And that's you, right? And this one...

336
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:01,238
- That's Rocco.
- Which one?

337
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:04,158
- Him.
- Oh, yes, that's Rocco.

338
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:09,705
That's the other brother.
Oh? And who's the boxer?

339
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:13,667
"Vincenzo".
Who's Vincenzo?

340
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:18,213
He's the boxer,
but he's got no feeling for it.

341
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:20,090
Why not?

342
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:23,761
It's a shame.
I have a friend who's a champion.

343
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:25,554
- Really?
- Yes.

344
00:29:25,638 --> 00:29:28,766
He was just a nobody
and now he's rich.

345
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:31,435
He made piles of money.

346
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:37,232
And his car... I swear he drives
a car as long as a bus!

347
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:41,987
Better than shovelling snow.

348
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:44,448
You see? You see?

349
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:48,494
He's against us trying out.
One of us could be champ.

350
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:51,538
- What's there to lose?
- Yeah.

351
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,374
You're right.

352
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:58,295
If you're so convinced,
then try it!

353
00:29:58,379 --> 00:30:01,757
You don't need his permission.
You heard what the lady said.

354
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:05,469
Rubbish! My great career's
already come to an end.

355
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:10,599
They pay you 2,000 lire a fight
if you're lucky!

356
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:12,935
Because you're not a real champ.

357
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:15,479
You don't become one overnight.

358
00:30:15,563 --> 00:30:21,401
Maybe Simone and Rocco just might.
They're stronger than you.

359
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:24,446
One smashed up face in the family
is enough!

360
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:29,159
The guy capable of knocking
Simone out hasn't been born yet.

361
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:31,954
Mama's right, Simone's stronger.

362
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:35,207
I almost forgot, here, put this on.

363
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:38,126
I couldn't find anything else better.

364
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:46,301
Thank you.
I'll bring it back tomorrow.

365
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:50,597
Wait, it's my friend, the Sergeant,
who lives in this building.

366
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,599
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

367
00:30:52,725 --> 00:30:57,604
Could you take her home?
She's had a fight with her father.

368
00:30:57,689 --> 00:31:01,066
- You can change in the bathroom.
- Thanks.

369
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:06,530
She's all we need!

370
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:10,742
Vincenzo, come here
and close that door!

371
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:15,664
Here! What's got into you,
bringing her here?

372
00:31:15,748 --> 00:31:18,709
You don't even know her.
She could be a whore!

373
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:21,378
- She's beautiful.
- Beautiful?

374
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:24,298
She had goose pimples,
the weakling!

375
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:27,759
You know nothing about women,
you boys.

376
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:30,095
She had goose pimples
because she was cold.

377
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:33,974
No, she's anaemic,
she's got Northern skin!

378
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:46,862
- She's gone.
- Gone? With my coat?

379
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:51,283
She went out the window.

380
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:53,827
Run off? She's a thief.

381
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:56,663
Her dress.

382
00:31:56,789 --> 00:31:58,624
You're kidding.

383
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,671
I'm sorry,
I bothered you for nothing.

384
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,381
Don't worry.

385
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:09,051
- Good night.
- Good night.

386
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:14,640
- Disappointed?
- Me? I don't care.

387
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:18,518
You worry about yourself.
And wash those lentils.

388
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:24,191
You see, Ginetta is not
the only girl in the world.

389
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:27,861
Time to eat, boys.
The soup's ready. Come on!

390
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:35,327
Rocco, come and eat.

391
00:32:56,766 --> 00:33:01,103
Maria Donata

392
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:05,607
What beautiful flower this is

393
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:10,946
Let me give it a kiss

394
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:15,575
Oh, it's your mouth,
your nose

395
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:22,332
My love's a rose, a rose...

396
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:24,668
Turn round.

397
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:26,962
Your right!

398
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:31,216
Hold it! Keep your right up.

399
00:33:34,595 --> 00:33:37,264
- Hold on, I'll be back.
- What's up?

400
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:48,984
- What are you doing here?
- Just watching.

401
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:53,280
Sorry, Merli! They're my brothers.
It wasn't my idea...

402
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:56,575
Combi, have them get changed!

403
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:59,703
Parondi, get your ass back in here!

404
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:05,876
You heard him? Move it!

405
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,920
Well? Get a move on!

406
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:12,299
What are you waiting for? Move it!

407
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:18,055
- Wait a minute, you.
- You talking to me?

408
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:20,307
Yeah, you with the cigarette.

409
00:34:21,684 --> 00:34:24,478
Put some shorts on and hurry it up!

410
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:32,319
These Southern hicks...
They wanna box and smoke too!

411
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:38,366
Get changed.

412
00:34:43,122 --> 00:34:45,123
- Where are you from?
- Lucania.

413
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:47,918
- Where's that?
- Oh, a long way from here.

414
00:34:48,002 --> 00:34:51,088
- You came up here to box?
- Why not?

415
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:53,673
- It's tough!
- We'll do our best.

416
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:04,726
Silence! Shut up!

417
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:13,527
Vincenzo!

418
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:19,032
Vincenzo!

419
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:33,046
Vincenzo!

420
00:35:46,185 --> 00:35:51,523
- Vincenzo, where are you?
- I'm up here!

421
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:57,070
- They've come to evict us!
- At last!

422
00:35:57,155 --> 00:36:00,282
Mama doesn't know what to do.
You coming?

423
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:02,409
I can't.

424
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:06,913
Tell Mama the City Hall
will give us a place now.

425
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:12,502
She's no need to worry.
Do like I said, go on!

426
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:17,424
Again! Again!

427
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:23,138
Where you going? Come here!

428
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:31,605
Come here! Jab! Jab!

429
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:33,648
Bravo.

430
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:50,123
Ciao, Duilio, how's it going?

431
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:57,380
Fine, fine. He's new?

432
00:36:57,465 --> 00:37:00,592
Yeah, three months.
He's slow, but solid.

433
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:03,553
- Go take your shower.
- OK.

434
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:08,558
Hey!

435
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:18,151
Not bad.

436
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:23,657
Teeth like a wolf, but nicotine-stained.

437
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:27,077
If you want to box,
cut out the cigarettes.

438
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:31,539
No offence, but if he stays here,
he'll get nowhere.

439
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:38,672
Got a minute?

440
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:45,428
Hey, Duilio, don't start taking
my best recruits now.

441
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:52,727
You'll see,
you'll be going with him.

442
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:55,272
Cerri's Gym,
where the champs work out.

443
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,819
Let's hope they release me.

444
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:04,948
But even if they don't...
I'll go anyway.

445
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:12,080
They think I've got the goods.

446
00:38:12,164 --> 00:38:14,958
- They never wanted Vincenzo.
- True.

447
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:20,839
- What about you?
- I guess I don't have the goods.

448
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:25,719
Wait, I'm going to shower too.

449
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:18,605
Age?

450
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:20,607
Twenty-one.

451
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:22,859
Military service?

452
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:26,196
I was rejected because of an injury.

453
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:29,407
We'll get round that.
Are you willing to work?

454
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:32,285
To work?

455
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,287
In Cerri's Gym.

456
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:38,208
To get yourself into shape.

457
00:39:39,001 --> 00:39:42,837
We're forming a stable
of newcomers.

458
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:46,341
You're not that young,

459
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:49,803
but we'll see how you get on.

460
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:56,935
Coca-Cola! Beer! Chinotto!

461
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:03,608
Knock him down!

462
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:05,944
Go on!

463
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:12,700
And now, a light heavyweight match,
two rounds of three minutes each

464
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:15,453
between Parondi from Lombardy

465
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:18,123
representing
the Aurora Club of Milan.

466
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:25,922
- I'm leaving.
- Sit down!

467
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:29,676
Parondi, you traitor!

468
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:33,680
- They're mocking me.
- Ignore them. Worry about Simone.

469
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:35,807
They're Ginetta's brothers.

470
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:41,688
And Vitolo,
representing Virtus Club, Lucania.

471
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:44,607
Go, Vitolo, teach him a lesson!

472
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:46,276
Quiet! Quiet!

473
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,486
The Parondis are all traitors!

474
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:52,115
And our referee
is Mr Ferri, from Genoa.

475
00:40:58,539 --> 00:41:00,915
Seconds out.

476
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:10,758
Round one.

477
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:30,820
Parondi! Parondi!

478
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:54,093
Come on, Simone! Come on!

479
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:09,984
- Bluff!
- Cut it out!

480
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:12,195
He's faking!

481
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:39,722
Ladies and gentlemen,

482
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:44,143
by a knockout
in the first round,

483
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:47,689
the winner is Simone Parondi.

484
00:42:57,116 --> 00:43:01,286
Excuse me... Hello, everybody!

485
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:04,998
Bravo! Well done!

486
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:07,083
And what's this?

487
00:43:07,167 --> 00:43:11,546
Nothing. Anyway, the other guy
didn't even go the limit.

488
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:15,883
How modest. "Didn't go the limit"!
You're a champ!

489
00:43:18,178 --> 00:43:23,600
Purple... the colour of champions
and showgirls.

490
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:30,106
I'll train him myself.
I know exactly what he needs.

491
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:34,193
We'll eat out tonight to celebrate.

492
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:36,154
I'll be waiting in my car. OK?

493
00:43:36,238 --> 00:43:38,114
- Sure, thanks.
- Ciao!

494
00:43:38,198 --> 00:43:41,242
- Good evening.
- Simone!

495
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:45,079
- There's a fight going on outside!
- A fight? Where?

496
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:46,831
Come on! Quick!

497
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:53,296
Traitor! Traitor!

498
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:08,394
Cowards!

499
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:11,731
Cowards!

500
00:44:18,864 --> 00:44:20,365
Come away.

501
00:44:20,449 --> 00:44:22,241
Come on!

502
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:36,881
- Come on, move it!
- Vincenzo!

503
00:44:37,591 --> 00:44:40,468
- Vincenzo! Let me go!
- Come away!

504
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:44,847
Alfredo, wait!
We have a score to settle.

505
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:48,976
- I've already settled everything.
- Not with me, you haven't.

506
00:44:49,061 --> 00:44:52,605
- Please, Vincenzo, enough.
- Shut up and go home!

507
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:55,942
- Move it!
- Ginetta! Ginetta!

508
00:44:56,026 --> 00:45:00,113
I said, go home!

509
00:45:04,743 --> 00:45:06,452
- Leave me alone!
- Ciro!

510
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:08,454
Leave me alone!

511
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:14,460
Traitor! Traitor!

512
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:36,023
- Remember me?
- Yes, of course.

513
00:45:36,108 --> 00:45:38,901
Well, then...

514
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:41,821
- You coming?
- I'm coming.

515
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:16,606
So, you decided to box, eh?

516
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:21,778
A good idea, I'd say.

517
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:31,704
It's a good profession, boxing,
isn't it?

518
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:34,916
Taste good?

519
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:42,548
If I'm not mistaken, you box

520
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:45,593
the way I put out.

521
00:46:46,386 --> 00:46:51,432
- For money.
- No, I box with feeling.

522
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:53,476
With feeling, eh?

523
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:57,146
Well, I work with feeling too.

524
00:47:04,571 --> 00:47:08,574
- And your brother?
- Which one of the four?

525
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:13,871
The oldest, the one who called
the police that night.

526
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:18,459
What a day that was!

527
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:21,754
First it snowed, then my father...

528
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:25,091
then running away.

529
00:47:26,426 --> 00:47:29,387
I never could stand the police.

530
00:47:29,471 --> 00:47:32,348
Even as a kid.
You can imagine now!

531
00:47:40,649 --> 00:47:43,025
I'm tired.

532
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:45,236
I'll sleep and you disappear.

533
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:47,947
- No.
- What do you mean, no?

534
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:51,617
You will, because I'm telling you to.

535
00:47:52,244 --> 00:47:55,621
I like sleeping alone.

536
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:58,332
That's the reason I took this place.

537
00:47:59,459 --> 00:48:05,047
When I was little, my father was sick,
and was in hospital for a long time.

538
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:10,011
My mother and I ended up
staying with an uncle.

539
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:14,599
After the war,
houses were hard to find.

540
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:20,354
I remember how
we were all together...

541
00:48:21,481 --> 00:48:23,983
all crammed into one room.

542
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:26,402
Just like your house.

543
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:34,493
In the summer, when school was over,
we'd play in the courtyard.

544
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:39,040
I was big for my age

545
00:48:39,124 --> 00:48:41,709
and didn't like kids' games.

546
00:48:42,794 --> 00:48:44,921
So I'd just watch.

547
00:48:46,882 --> 00:48:51,594
There was a man...
He was a dentist...

548
00:48:53,805 --> 00:48:56,098
We began meeting.

549
00:48:57,559 --> 00:49:00,686
After that, I started
spending the night at his place.

550
00:49:02,856 --> 00:49:07,818
A great improvement, as now
there were only two of us in bed.

551
00:49:09,154 --> 00:49:12,615
- How old were you?
- Thirteen.

552
00:49:14,743 --> 00:49:18,579
It's not true, it's not true
what I said about the dentist.

553
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:21,540
I had a happy childhood.

554
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:27,046
It was later on that
the trouble started.

555
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:32,677
Please, I'm so tired.

556
00:49:32,761 --> 00:49:35,262
I already told you to go.

557
00:49:38,016 --> 00:49:40,434
What is it?

558
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:42,395
Again?

559
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:01,288
Ciro!

560
00:50:02,374 --> 00:50:06,085
- I'm over here!
- Coming!

561
00:50:13,427 --> 00:50:15,886
- Well, then, Luca?
- Here...

562
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:17,430
Thanks.

563
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:22,810
These are the notices
for night school.

564
00:50:22,936 --> 00:50:27,982
They were free but you need
an elementary school certificate.

565
00:50:28,066 --> 00:50:29,692
I have one.

566
00:50:29,776 --> 00:50:32,403
- Here.
- What's that?

567
00:50:35,323 --> 00:50:37,700
Stop wasting your money!

568
00:50:37,784 --> 00:50:40,244
Simone gave it to me.

569
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:44,081
Ah, Simone!
Did he go to work this morning?

570
00:50:44,166 --> 00:50:47,043
He was sleeping when I left.

571
00:50:47,127 --> 00:50:49,462
He never works mornings.

572
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:52,631
Yeah, and who knows
what work he does?

573
00:50:52,758 --> 00:50:57,553
He's doing something good.
He gave Mama 2,000 lire yesterday.

574
00:50:57,637 --> 00:51:03,601
- And what are you doing?
- I'm delivery boy for the grocer nearby.

575
00:51:05,687 --> 00:51:09,690
As soon as I turn twenty,
I'll show you all!

576
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:11,942
- Yeah... ciao.
- Ciao, Luca.

577
00:51:24,164 --> 00:51:27,792
Are you sure you know
how to read?

578
00:51:27,876 --> 00:51:32,004
Everything's in such a mess
since you've been here.

579
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:34,507
- No, not this one.
- It is. Look!

580
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:37,843
- No.
- It's always been a mess here, Rocco.

581
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:42,932
- No, it hasn't.
- Give me the receipts, and I'll check.

582
00:51:43,016 --> 00:51:46,852
- They're all mixed up.
- Let's see...

583
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:49,647
The boss said
she's got a headache.

584
00:51:49,731 --> 00:51:52,900
She probably didn't sleep
last night, poor thing.

585
00:51:52,984 --> 00:51:57,947
Can't you at least remember her name?
She's related to the boss.

586
00:51:58,031 --> 00:52:00,658
Rocco's only been here a month.

587
00:52:00,742 --> 00:52:03,744
A year wouldn't be enough time,
huh, Rocco?

588
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:05,955
He's our "Sleeping Beauty"!

589
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:09,875
Ida, give him a kiss,
that might wake him up.

590
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:14,171
- No, my boyfriend would kill me!
- I'll do it.

591
00:52:20,053 --> 00:52:21,971
Oh, God! A customer!

592
00:52:22,055 --> 00:52:25,391
- Hello? Signora Ubaldi?
- Who's he?

593
00:52:25,517 --> 00:52:27,393
My brother, Simone.

594
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:29,770
Tell him to come round the back
or clear off.

595
00:52:29,855 --> 00:52:32,356
The boss doesn't want
relatives visiting.

596
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:35,276
- Good morning, ladies.
- Good morning.

597
00:52:36,069 --> 00:52:40,739
Wow, very nice.
That's something I could use.

598
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:47,746
Rocco, you never said
it was such a nice place.

599
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:49,999
You hang your clothes there and...

600
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:55,504
Can't you read? You come in,
undress and go out brand new.

601
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:57,548
That's exactly what I need.

602
00:52:57,632 --> 00:53:00,885
- How fast can you do it?
- It's expensive.

603
00:53:00,969 --> 00:53:03,053
Hey, I can pay!

604
00:53:04,764 --> 00:53:07,308
What's going on here?

605
00:53:09,561 --> 00:53:14,023
They said they could give me
a make-over in five minutes. Is that true?

606
00:53:14,107 --> 00:53:16,734
- You want proof?
- Yes.

607
00:53:16,818 --> 00:53:20,529
- In the booth. Take care of him.
- Thanks.

608
00:53:20,655 --> 00:53:23,532
- Rocco, are you still here?
- That's his brother.

609
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:25,868
Show her the package.

610
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:31,332
There's no receipt. It belongs
to your relative... what's-her-name?

611
00:53:31,416 --> 00:53:33,584
It's Signora Brighetti.

612
00:53:34,544 --> 00:53:36,420
Here are my trousers.

613
00:53:39,257 --> 00:53:41,342
And here's my shirt.

614
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:44,386
- Ma'am!
- Yes?

615
00:53:46,306 --> 00:53:48,557
Can we do this shirt?

616
00:53:49,976 --> 00:53:52,102
No, not the shirt.

617
00:53:52,812 --> 00:53:55,439
- It's too frayed.
- What a shame.

618
00:53:55,523 --> 00:53:58,525
- Nothing I can do.
- What I need most is this shirt.

619
00:53:58,610 --> 00:54:01,570
Let me see what we can do here.

620
00:54:01,655 --> 00:54:04,949
Rocco, hurry up or you'll be late!

621
00:54:05,033 --> 00:54:06,909
Come over here.

622
00:54:06,993 --> 00:54:09,495
I have to talk to him.

623
00:54:09,579 --> 00:54:12,248
All the rest was just for fun.

624
00:54:12,332 --> 00:54:14,124
Pardon us, then.

625
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:19,421
Rocco! I've got something
important going on.

626
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:23,342
Listen, have you been paid yet?

627
00:54:23,468 --> 00:54:27,638
- Not till tonight.
- I need the money right now.

628
00:54:27,722 --> 00:54:32,017
Tell them at the gym
that I'll be gone two days.

629
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:34,603
Rocco, don't lend him anything.

630
00:54:34,688 --> 00:54:36,814
But I thought you liked me, ma'am.

631
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:42,027
I'm only protecting Rocco,
he should be wary of you.

632
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:44,947
- You'll do it?
- Sure.

633
00:54:46,866 --> 00:54:49,660
What should I give him?

634
00:54:49,744 --> 00:54:53,831
- Half a month's wages?
- Yes, Signora.

635
00:54:53,915 --> 00:54:56,083
- After taxes, that is.
- Of course.

636
00:54:56,167 --> 00:54:57,876
Fine.

637
00:55:00,755 --> 00:55:04,133
- Does Mama know?
- Yeah, she knows.

638
00:55:07,262 --> 00:55:10,180
Rocco, come here...

639
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:27,323
Your trousers are almost ready, sir.

640
00:55:27,407 --> 00:55:30,075
May I have the jacket?
It'll take a few minutes.

641
00:55:32,037 --> 00:55:34,621
- Here.
- Thanks.

642
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:37,416
Sign this.

643
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:41,378
Ready! Your trousers are ready!

644
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:46,592
- That was fast.
- I told you so.

645
00:55:48,219 --> 00:55:51,388
Here's your coffee and your aspirin.

646
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:58,270
- I feel like a new man. Thanks.
- Drop in again, sir. Bye.

647
00:55:58,355 --> 00:56:02,274
- Here I am.
- Look at him. I hardly recognise you!

648
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:06,153
- You could use a new shirt, though.
- Like one of those...

649
00:56:06,237 --> 00:56:09,448
They're Dr Fossati's shirts.

650
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:13,786
- They'd look better on your figure.
- Yes...

651
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:17,998
But that's life,
luxuries always come too late.

652
00:56:18,917 --> 00:56:23,253
Here's your brother's 5,000 lire.
You owe me 700 for the pressing.

653
00:56:23,338 --> 00:56:26,548
I don't have it.
Rocco will pay you.

654
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:31,053
Ma'am, good day and many thanks.

655
00:56:31,137 --> 00:56:33,055
- Good day.
- Good day.

656
00:56:33,139 --> 00:56:35,682
- Good day to you.
- Good day.

657
00:56:35,767 --> 00:56:38,435
Good day and bye for now.

658
00:56:39,896 --> 00:56:43,982
No, please, my head!
Enough, I said!

659
00:56:44,859 --> 00:56:46,652
Go on! Faster!

660
00:56:47,445 --> 00:56:49,530
Close the door, boy!

661
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:55,411
Didn't you hear me?
What do you want?

662
00:56:58,415 --> 00:57:02,000
- What do you want?
- My brother Simone is sick.

663
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:05,629
- He won't be coming in.
- He can't come in?

664
00:57:05,713 --> 00:57:10,217
Sick, eh?
They saw him in town.

665
00:57:11,219 --> 00:57:15,472
- I wouldn't know about that.
- There's a draught, come inside!

666
00:57:15,557 --> 00:57:18,684
You wouldn't know, huh?
Well, I'm onto him.

667
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:26,024
You're his brother? Then listen.

668
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:29,611
Instead of helping him,
I should've hanged him. Right, Cerri?

669
00:57:30,738 --> 00:57:33,866
That's it!
That's enough for today, all of you.

670
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:40,038
I know you're fed up with him too.
I shouldn't have brought him here.

671
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:44,751
I admit it, I made a mistake.
Never again!

672
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:50,090
That's it for today, lads.

673
00:57:54,721 --> 00:57:58,348
- So you're Simone's brother, huh?
- Yes.

674
00:57:58,433 --> 00:58:03,854
Your brother's got a nice build,
a good punch, but he's slow.

675
00:58:03,938 --> 00:58:07,107
He should be working out
more than the others.

676
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:11,528
Come on in. This is my office.

677
00:58:12,572 --> 00:58:17,409
They all trained with me.
All fine boxers, thanks to me.

678
00:58:20,705 --> 00:58:22,748
Close the door.

679
00:58:26,044 --> 00:58:30,380
You want to help
before it's too late, eh?

680
00:58:30,465 --> 00:58:34,968
Come to the gym together,
you and him.

681
00:58:35,053 --> 00:58:37,679
- Me?
- Yes, you.

682
00:58:37,764 --> 00:58:42,809
Stay with him, and never
let him out of your sight.

683
00:58:42,894 --> 00:58:45,729
- What's your name?
- Rocco.

684
00:58:45,813 --> 00:58:48,857
Like Rocco Mazzola,
from Lucania, like you.

685
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:50,984
You're a good kid.

686
00:58:51,110 --> 00:58:55,614
It won't cost you anything,
just look after your brother.

687
00:58:55,698 --> 00:59:00,911
And stop him from hanging out
with certain people.

688
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:04,456
Boxing's a serious thing,

689
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:09,127
you've gotta lead a clean life,
like all of them.

690
00:59:09,254 --> 00:59:13,382
Good morals are the first requisite
of an athlete, understand?

691
00:59:13,466 --> 00:59:18,136
Meaning that...
women, cigarettes, drinking...

692
00:59:19,597 --> 00:59:22,724
and many other things
are taboo.

693
00:59:22,809 --> 00:59:25,018
Absolutely taboo.

694
00:59:25,645 --> 00:59:30,482
Just look at that motorboat,
they're ruining the business.

695
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:33,986
Let's go, come on.

696
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:37,823
- Bye, now.
- Happy Easter.

697
00:59:44,539 --> 00:59:47,207
- What place is that?
- It's a hotel.

698
00:59:47,292 --> 00:59:50,711
A first-class hotel, sweetie!

699
00:59:50,795 --> 00:59:54,006
- Can we see it?
- Why not?

700
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:56,425
It's called "The Great Britain".

701
00:59:56,509 --> 01:00:00,596
It used to have many English tourists,
but not so many now.

702
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:03,724
People are here now for Easter.

703
01:00:03,808 --> 01:00:06,268
It must have 200, 250 rooms.

704
01:00:06,394 --> 01:00:10,397
- See you around.
- Bye, now.

705
01:00:10,481 --> 01:00:11,982
A garden!

706
01:00:12,066 --> 01:00:15,777
And it's fabulous.
You should see inside

707
01:00:16,946 --> 01:00:19,072
- I was in there once.
- Really?

708
01:00:19,157 --> 01:00:21,992
- Yes! Inside, it's fantastic.
- Beautiful...

709
01:00:22,076 --> 01:00:27,289
You should see the rooms,
not like our pension.

710
01:00:30,043 --> 01:00:33,086
The place is quite amazing

711
01:00:33,171 --> 01:00:35,881
and so are the prices!

712
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:38,634
- Know what they charge?
- No.

713
01:00:38,718 --> 01:00:40,844
- Just for a room?
- No.

714
01:00:40,928 --> 01:00:44,681
10,000 lire a day for one room.

715
01:00:45,516 --> 01:00:48,518
- Yes, just to sleep!
- 10,000 lire...?

716
01:00:49,937 --> 01:00:54,524
But who'd pay that just for a bed
to sleep in? That's so much!

717
01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:58,612
They must be crazy.
How can they ask that much?

718
01:00:58,696 --> 01:01:01,740
Anyway,
very soon we'll come here.

719
01:01:03,076 --> 01:01:04,785
Want to bet?

720
01:01:04,869 --> 01:01:07,537
When I turn professional...

721
01:01:07,622 --> 01:01:11,958
- Got a cigarette?
- Hmm... What a place!

722
01:01:13,544 --> 01:01:16,129
- Want one?
- Oh, no. I shouldn't.

723
01:01:16,214 --> 01:01:18,090
The boxer!

724
01:01:25,181 --> 01:01:26,932
I'll keep them.

725
01:01:27,016 --> 01:01:29,685
What'll you earn?

726
01:01:29,769 --> 01:01:34,523
I don't know... Plenty, I hope.
But I gotta train hard.

727
01:01:34,607 --> 01:01:38,235
It'll be a sacrifice. For you too.

728
01:01:38,319 --> 01:01:40,112
Why for me?

729
01:01:40,196 --> 01:01:44,866
When you're in training,
you can't...

730
01:01:44,951 --> 01:01:50,747
Let's get something straight.
We're not married.

731
01:01:51,332 --> 01:01:53,834
We just go out sometimes.

732
01:01:54,585 --> 01:01:58,672
We may not go out again
for another year.

733
01:01:58,756 --> 01:02:02,676
But now we're together
and that's fine.

734
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:05,721
I needed a change of scene anyway

735
01:02:05,805 --> 01:02:08,557
without attracting
too much attention.

736
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:14,062
After each affair,
a nice clean break... I'm gone!

737
01:02:15,189 --> 01:02:17,357
You get me?

738
01:02:20,194 --> 01:02:23,697
- Miss!
- Who, me?

739
01:02:23,823 --> 01:02:26,950
- You can't stay here, I'm sorry.
- Why not?

740
01:02:27,034 --> 01:02:29,911
- You have to move away.
- Is it reserved?

741
01:02:29,996 --> 01:02:32,205
- What's wrong, we got lice?
- Sorry.

742
01:02:32,290 --> 01:02:35,459
- That's the limit!
- Do we have to pay?

743
01:02:35,543 --> 01:02:40,046
- I just follow orders.
- He just follows orders!

744
01:02:40,131 --> 01:02:43,258
- Well, I happen to like it here!
- Good day, sir.

745
01:02:43,342 --> 01:02:46,845
Our regards to the manager!

746
01:02:46,929 --> 01:02:49,765
You want money, you idiot?

747
01:02:58,941 --> 01:03:00,901
- Bye, Rocco!
- Ciao.

748
01:03:17,001 --> 01:03:20,003
- Rocco!
- What is it?

749
01:03:20,087 --> 01:03:23,632
- Have you seen my brother?
- He just left. Didn't you see him?

750
01:03:23,716 --> 01:03:26,134
- No, I didn't.
- Who's there?

751
01:03:26,969 --> 01:03:29,554
It's just me, Rocco's brother.

752
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:34,017
I have a package here for him.
I'll come by tomorrow.

753
01:03:34,101 --> 01:03:36,853
Could I leave it with the porter?

754
01:03:36,938 --> 01:03:40,106
Yes, or in the store. Come on.

755
01:03:40,191 --> 01:03:42,859
Through here, the door on the left.

756
01:03:42,944 --> 01:03:45,028
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

757
01:03:47,448 --> 01:03:49,658
Excuse me?

758
01:03:49,742 --> 01:03:52,285
- Anybody here?
- Yes.

759
01:03:55,164 --> 01:03:59,084
- Good evening. How are you?
- Oh, it's you.

760
01:03:59,168 --> 01:04:03,296
One of the girls said
I could leave this package.

761
01:04:03,381 --> 01:04:06,216
I didn't expect to see you,
but I'm glad you're here.

762
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:08,426
What is it?

763
01:04:12,557 --> 01:04:15,350
There you go...

764
01:04:18,563 --> 01:04:21,314
It needs washing. It's not mine.

765
01:04:21,399 --> 01:04:24,943
It's one of the shirts
that were over there.

766
01:04:25,027 --> 01:04:27,946
I wore it only the once.

767
01:04:28,030 --> 01:04:31,867
You said it would look better on me
than Dr Fossati...

768
01:04:32,910 --> 01:04:35,871
What? Have you gone mad?

769
01:04:35,955 --> 01:04:38,123
Answer me!

770
01:04:38,249 --> 01:04:41,710
And stop laughing!
You come in here asking favours

771
01:04:41,794 --> 01:04:47,215
and then ridicule our courtesy
with your insolence!

772
01:04:48,801 --> 01:04:51,720
- Thief!
- I wasn't really stealing...

773
01:04:52,847 --> 01:04:55,181
I find that hard to believe!

774
01:04:59,478 --> 01:05:04,482
You take advantage of people's
kindness and generosity.

775
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:09,863
I'm so gullible, ready to believe
everyone and everything.

776
01:05:09,947 --> 01:05:15,160
It's a struggle for a woman alone
to keep track of everything.

777
01:05:17,705 --> 01:05:19,998
What do you want of me?

778
01:05:29,967 --> 01:05:32,427
No, don't... please.

779
01:06:00,581 --> 01:06:03,041
Why do they suspect you?

780
01:06:03,125 --> 01:06:05,043
I don't know.

781
01:06:05,127 --> 01:06:07,629
The boss keeps watching me.

782
01:06:07,713 --> 01:06:10,840
She's a little crazy.

783
01:06:10,925 --> 01:06:13,009
That's true.

784
01:06:15,471 --> 01:06:18,765
But the girls keep watching me too.

785
01:06:19,809 --> 01:06:22,978
Tomorrow let's go to the police
and straighten it out.

786
01:06:23,062 --> 01:06:24,521
Yeah.

787
01:06:25,314 --> 01:06:28,775
Parondi! Parondi, you're wanted
at the entrance!

788
01:06:28,859 --> 01:06:31,027
They've come to arrest me.

789
01:06:32,113 --> 01:06:34,990
Who's calling our name?

790
01:06:39,412 --> 01:06:43,081
- No, Mama, I'll go.
- You go, then.

791
01:06:47,461 --> 01:06:51,131
- What's up?
- They want Vincenzo Parondi upstairs.

792
01:06:51,215 --> 01:06:53,383
Vincenzo?

793
01:06:53,467 --> 01:06:56,219
Vincenzo? He's not here.

794
01:06:57,096 --> 01:07:01,808
You know where he is?
What do they want with Vincenzo?

795
01:07:01,892 --> 01:07:04,394
I don't know. I'll go and find him.

796
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:07,522
- Yes, do that.
- Good night.

797
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:12,485
Do you know what they want
with him at this hour?

798
01:07:12,570 --> 01:07:15,071
- It's not that late.
- What time is it?

799
01:07:15,156 --> 01:07:17,949
- It's only 10.
- Oh.

800
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:20,618
Go back to bed.

801
01:07:22,496 --> 01:07:26,166
- Shall I come as well?
- No, stay here with Mama.

802
01:07:29,003 --> 01:07:31,546
- Hey, Rocco!
- Good evening.

803
01:07:39,472 --> 01:07:41,181
What's wrong?

804
01:07:41,265 --> 01:07:44,642
Go to sleep, go on.

805
01:07:47,354 --> 01:07:50,940
And what about you?
When will you finish?

806
01:07:51,025 --> 01:07:55,987
I still have to study.
I'll wait up for Rocco.

807
01:07:56,947 --> 01:07:59,949
- All right.
- Good night.

808
01:08:04,914 --> 01:08:07,665
Simone isn't back yet.

809
01:08:09,418 --> 01:08:12,754
And neither is Vincenzo.
Oh, these boys!

810
01:08:15,591 --> 01:08:18,760
Hey, you! Hurry up.

811
01:08:18,844 --> 01:08:20,845
Come here!

812
01:08:22,306 --> 01:08:24,974
- You want me?
- You're Vincenzo?

813
01:08:25,059 --> 01:08:28,478
- No, he's with Ginetta, his fiancée.
- Oh, really?

814
01:08:28,562 --> 01:08:31,314
They're engaged,
but Mama doesn't approve,

815
01:08:31,398 --> 01:08:36,653
so they meet outside
otherwise she makes a scene.

816
01:08:36,737 --> 01:08:39,697
I don't want your whole family history.

817
01:08:39,782 --> 01:08:42,700
- Who are you?
- Me? Rocco.

818
01:08:42,785 --> 01:08:46,996
Oh, yeah? I have to talk to you
about something. Hop in.

819
01:08:47,081 --> 01:08:49,207
- In there?
- Yes, of course.

820
01:08:49,291 --> 01:08:52,210
Not here. The other side.

821
01:08:52,294 --> 01:08:54,337
Here...?

822
01:08:57,883 --> 01:09:01,344
If I don't practise driving,
I'll never learn.

823
01:09:02,513 --> 01:09:04,931
Is that street one-way?

824
01:09:06,058 --> 01:09:09,394
- I don't drive.
- Oh, great!

825
01:09:12,106 --> 01:09:15,650
Yeah, it's a one-way street.

826
01:09:18,863 --> 01:09:22,532
The whole world's
like a one-way street.

827
01:09:24,827 --> 01:09:28,830
- Where are we going?
- Where I won't meet anybody.

828
01:09:32,835 --> 01:09:35,587
Here will do fine.

829
01:09:35,671 --> 01:09:40,133
I asked for Vincenzo
because I know him better,

830
01:09:40,217 --> 01:09:42,510
but you'll do.

831
01:09:42,595 --> 01:09:45,597
Do you recognise this?

832
01:09:48,893 --> 01:09:51,477
Simone says he bought it,

833
01:09:51,562 --> 01:09:56,357
but I say he stole it,
and I don't care where.

834
01:09:56,442 --> 01:10:00,945
I've got enough troubles.
I can't take risks.

835
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:03,781
Do you understand?

836
01:10:03,866 --> 01:10:07,535
- No.
- You don't understand? Great!

837
01:10:08,954 --> 01:10:12,665
- Why steal this?
- To make me happy.

838
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:16,294
Seems I'm worth it.
Don't you think so?

839
01:10:18,172 --> 01:10:21,341
What are you wearing under there?

840
01:10:21,425 --> 01:10:25,428
- I was already in bed.
- Ah, in bed?

841
01:10:27,097 --> 01:10:30,016
You're nice and warm.

842
01:10:31,393 --> 01:10:33,811
Don't worry, I don't bite.

843
01:10:33,896 --> 01:10:38,274
Tell your brother that
I'm giving back this stuff.

844
01:10:38,359 --> 01:10:42,070
Thank him, but tell him not
to come looking for me.

845
01:10:42,154 --> 01:10:44,280
You understand?

846
01:10:44,365 --> 01:10:46,574
"Nadia's left. She's gone forever."

847
01:10:48,202 --> 01:10:52,830
What are you staring at?
Do I look strange or something?

848
01:10:52,915 --> 01:10:55,833
No, you're not strange.
You're very considerate.

849
01:10:57,419 --> 01:11:00,838
- Why did he do it?
- Why do you think?

850
01:11:00,923 --> 01:11:06,219
Good night, little boy.
I'm glad you find me considerate.

851
01:11:06,303 --> 01:11:09,847
Sorry I can't drive you back,
but it's late.

852
01:11:09,932 --> 01:11:14,644
Stop being so scared of me.
Now beat it!

853
01:11:14,728 --> 01:11:17,146
Go now.

854
01:11:20,401 --> 01:11:21,985
Hey!

855
01:11:57,104 --> 01:12:01,357
You're back.
Who did they want, you or me?

856
01:12:02,735 --> 01:12:08,197
They wanted me, at the shop,
for the keys to the storeroom.

857
01:12:08,282 --> 01:12:10,616
- The keys to the storeroom?
- Yes.

858
01:12:15,456 --> 01:12:17,540
And the theft?

859
01:12:20,544 --> 01:12:24,964
There wasn't one. She found the pin.
It wasn't stolen.

860
01:12:25,674 --> 01:12:29,010
- She's crazy.
- I told you.

861
01:12:31,638 --> 01:12:36,017
- I'm quitting.
- But it's a good job.

862
01:12:36,101 --> 01:12:38,394
Not any more.

863
01:12:38,479 --> 01:12:41,981
You should find something
better before quitting.

864
01:12:42,066 --> 01:12:44,067
I did.

865
01:12:46,445 --> 01:12:50,740
See this?
It's my draft card.

866
01:12:50,824 --> 01:12:53,201
It came this morning.

867
01:12:53,285 --> 01:12:57,455
But with everything going on,
I forgot about it.

868
01:12:58,540 --> 01:13:01,501
- I've been drafted.
- Good luck, then.

869
01:13:04,922 --> 01:13:08,800
- You hear that?
- It's his turn now.

870
01:13:08,884 --> 01:13:10,385
Good night.

871
01:13:10,928 --> 01:13:13,388
- Simone?
- What?

872
01:13:15,057 --> 01:13:17,016
I'd like to talk to you.

873
01:13:19,561 --> 01:13:24,232
Coming back from the shop,
I ran into a girl.

874
01:13:27,861 --> 01:13:32,532
The daughter of that family
at Lambrate, remember?

875
01:13:32,616 --> 01:13:34,200
Yeah.

876
01:13:35,744 --> 01:13:40,373
She said she's leaving,
going away.

877
01:13:40,457 --> 01:13:44,460
- When did you see her?
- Just now.

878
01:13:44,545 --> 01:13:46,212
Going where?

879
01:13:47,381 --> 01:13:50,800
She didn't say.

880
01:13:57,266 --> 01:13:59,725
You know her too?

881
01:14:02,604 --> 01:14:06,149
What does she want?
What's with her, anyway?

882
01:14:06,942 --> 01:14:09,735
She's just another girl...

883
01:14:13,824 --> 01:14:16,117
trying to be a lady.

884
01:14:17,369 --> 01:14:19,495
Who needs her?

885
01:14:23,083 --> 01:14:25,626
I've got better things to do.

886
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:36,095
If I ever see her again,
I'll turn the other way.

887
01:14:37,639 --> 01:14:40,808
If you see her, tell her that!

888
01:15:44,373 --> 01:15:48,793
"We finally moved
into the new apartment.

889
01:15:48,919 --> 01:15:53,965
"Everyone knows us
since Simone won that fight in Genoa.

890
01:15:54,049 --> 01:15:56,092
"They treat me with respect.

891
01:15:57,427 --> 01:16:00,054
"It would have been a good year

892
01:16:00,138 --> 01:16:05,268
"but Vincenzo got Ginetta pregnant
and had to marry her.

893
01:16:05,352 --> 01:16:09,021
"Now he's gone, and you're off
doing military service.

894
01:16:12,818 --> 01:16:17,780
"Simone can't work,
because he has to keep training.

895
01:16:17,864 --> 01:16:23,160
"Ciro has a new job
at the Alfa Romeo plant

896
01:16:23,245 --> 01:16:26,414
"thanks to his night school
diploma.

897
01:16:27,457 --> 01:16:33,254
"He's the only one bringing
any money in. And the expenses!

898
01:16:33,338 --> 01:16:36,924
"If you have anything left
from your pay, send it.

899
01:16:37,009 --> 01:16:42,305
"You can't spend it anyhow.
We're all well. I hope you are too.

900
01:16:42,389 --> 01:16:44,640
"A big hug from your loving Mother".

901
01:17:06,747 --> 01:17:08,748
Hey! Hey, you!

902
01:17:11,335 --> 01:17:13,753
I wasn't wrong, it is you.

903
01:17:13,837 --> 01:17:16,255
What's with that getup?

904
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:20,801
- I'm a soldier.
- That's pretty obvious. Since when?

905
01:17:20,886 --> 01:17:22,637
I've served 14 months.

906
01:17:22,721 --> 01:17:27,892
Me too, more or less.
And in this same town.

907
01:17:29,686 --> 01:17:32,271
Buy me a coffee.

908
01:17:32,356 --> 01:17:37,151
I'd like to, but I've just sent
all my money to my mother.

909
01:17:37,235 --> 01:17:39,820
I'll buy, you fool!

910
01:17:39,905 --> 01:17:44,033
Better yet, we'll hire a carriage
and ride through town...

911
01:17:44,117 --> 01:17:49,246
- I'll take your bag.
- ...and have coffee in a decent place.

912
01:17:49,331 --> 01:17:53,125
Driver, put the top down,
we need some air.

913
01:18:17,776 --> 01:18:20,486
- You didn't understand?
- No.

914
01:18:23,990 --> 01:18:27,410
13 months and 8 days.

915
01:18:29,287 --> 01:18:35,126
They wouldn't even consider parole...
because of my record.

916
01:18:38,338 --> 01:18:40,256
Was it bad?

917
01:18:40,340 --> 01:18:43,884
Fairly, but nothing too unbearable.

918
01:18:45,429 --> 01:18:48,681
Time flies
when every day is the same.

919
01:18:50,726 --> 01:18:55,146
It wouldn't seem so,
but it's true.

920
01:19:08,702 --> 01:19:11,412
Hey, wake up!

921
01:19:13,540 --> 01:19:16,709
Does knowing an ex-con
bother you?

922
01:19:16,835 --> 01:19:18,878
It's not that unusual.

923
01:19:20,464 --> 01:19:22,840
I'm not the only one.

924
01:19:23,508 --> 01:19:25,968
But I'm the first one you've met?

925
01:19:26,094 --> 01:19:27,762
No, no...

926
01:19:28,847 --> 01:19:32,349
Some friends in my home town...

927
01:19:33,310 --> 01:19:38,481
my own age,
poorer than you could ever imagine.

928
01:19:39,816 --> 01:19:45,029
They were led to believe
they could farm some land.

929
01:19:45,113 --> 01:19:49,950
But the land was arid,
and the work backbreaking,

930
01:19:50,035 --> 01:19:53,871
and it took hours to reach the place.

931
01:19:53,955 --> 01:19:58,000
Then one day,
they spoke up and rebelled.

932
01:20:00,587 --> 01:20:05,674
They were arrested
and then incarcerated...

933
01:20:07,427 --> 01:20:09,887
in Matera, in Potenza.

934
01:20:12,057 --> 01:20:14,475
My town was like that.

935
01:20:19,272 --> 01:20:23,776
I understand.
That's why you all came to the North?

936
01:20:23,902 --> 01:20:28,030
- I'd have stayed.
- Why? You don't like Milan?

937
01:20:28,114 --> 01:20:35,204
If only... we had the means
to live decently

938
01:20:36,039 --> 01:20:38,123
where we grew up.

939
01:20:38,250 --> 01:20:41,669
I'm lost in the city.

940
01:20:41,795 --> 01:20:45,589
I was neither born
nor raised in one.

941
01:20:46,842 --> 01:20:51,637
Not only me,
but my brothers and my friends too.

942
01:20:53,098 --> 01:20:57,226
Some get used to city life

943
01:20:57,310 --> 01:21:00,813
and they seek
the pleasures of city people.

944
01:21:01,523 --> 01:21:03,190
Not me.

945
01:21:04,359 --> 01:21:07,319
I don't think that it's right.

946
01:21:09,573 --> 01:21:15,160
I mean,
I want an automobile too.

947
01:21:15,245 --> 01:21:18,581
But after the things
that come first:

948
01:21:18,665 --> 01:21:24,211
a steady job, a home,
and eating every day.

949
01:21:24,296 --> 01:21:26,797
Am I making myself clear?

950
01:21:27,716 --> 01:21:30,301
And your opinion of me?

951
01:21:30,385 --> 01:21:33,137
- Nothing.
- Aren't you curious?

952
01:21:34,222 --> 01:21:36,682
Be frank, I won't be offended.

953
01:21:37,309 --> 01:21:41,228
I was wondering...
How old are you?

954
01:21:42,856 --> 01:21:44,773
That's easy...

955
01:21:45,525 --> 01:21:48,027
Twenty-five. So what?

956
01:21:48,111 --> 01:21:51,238
You did say, "Aren't you curious?"

957
01:21:51,323 --> 01:21:53,574
Nothing else interests you?

958
01:21:53,658 --> 01:21:56,243
I've offended you...

959
01:21:56,328 --> 01:21:57,953
How?

960
01:22:00,707 --> 01:22:03,667
You keep staring at me.

961
01:22:05,462 --> 01:22:07,546
Forgive me.

962
01:22:08,214 --> 01:22:12,801
But for some reason...
I feel great pity for you.

963
01:22:13,929 --> 01:22:16,388
How nice of you.

964
01:22:18,642 --> 01:22:21,352
Actually, I'm very tired.

965
01:22:22,729 --> 01:22:26,440
It wasn't exactly a vacation
that I went on,

966
01:22:26,524 --> 01:22:29,193
and what's to come will be worse.

967
01:22:29,277 --> 01:22:34,281
Don't say that. One can live
as one likes, if one chooses to.

968
01:22:35,909 --> 01:22:41,038
But you shouldn't be afraid,
and you seem to be.

969
01:22:41,122 --> 01:22:44,041
You really are something.

970
01:22:45,919 --> 01:22:50,089
Say no more. Look
at the effect you have on me.

971
01:22:50,173 --> 01:22:52,508
Do you want me to go?

972
01:22:52,592 --> 01:22:55,844
Don't be silly!
Take me to the station.

973
01:22:57,263 --> 01:23:01,850
But enough talk about me,
it's depressing.

974
01:23:05,313 --> 01:23:08,273
What would you do if you were me?

975
01:23:08,358 --> 01:23:13,654
Have faith and have no fear.
Great faith...

976
01:23:16,074 --> 01:23:19,868
- In what?
- I don't know... in everything.

977
01:23:22,956 --> 01:23:26,917
- In you?
- Yes, in me too.

978
01:23:29,546 --> 01:23:32,881
- Can we meet in Milan?
- Yes.

979
01:23:33,967 --> 01:23:37,469
Maybe you can teach me
not to be afraid.

980
01:23:39,556 --> 01:23:41,098
Yes...

981
01:23:42,434 --> 01:23:43,892
Yes.

982
01:24:20,847 --> 01:24:22,848
- Mama.
- Rocco!

983
01:24:24,267 --> 01:24:27,061
Mama's boy Rocco!

984
01:24:28,730 --> 01:24:32,483
Oh, my boy, you're so handsome!

985
01:24:33,610 --> 01:24:35,986
Come on in.

986
01:24:36,071 --> 01:24:38,322
I was just getting
your bed ready.

987
01:24:38,406 --> 01:24:42,159
They delivered it yesterday.

988
01:24:42,243 --> 01:24:46,538
Look at Rocco, he's just back
from military service!

989
01:24:46,623 --> 01:24:49,124
Let them see you.

990
01:24:49,209 --> 01:24:51,627
How handsome my boy is.

991
01:24:51,711 --> 01:24:55,839
There's not much furniture,
but we're getting there.

992
01:24:55,924 --> 01:25:00,260
But the picture of Saint Rocco
is always in my bedroom.

993
01:25:00,345 --> 01:25:05,599
- You look well.
- Oh, but my teeth are troubling me.

994
01:25:05,683 --> 01:25:08,352
Do you like the place?

995
01:25:08,436 --> 01:25:13,357
Yes, I like it very much.
But where is everybody?

996
01:25:13,483 --> 01:25:18,904
I purposely came on Sunday when
I thought everyone would be home.

997
01:25:18,988 --> 01:25:22,032
- I even wrote to you.
- I know, but...

998
01:25:22,117 --> 01:25:26,870
I kept thinking, surely Ciro
will meet me at the station?

999
01:25:29,916 --> 01:25:33,627
They'll be here at noon.
Don't get upset.

1000
01:25:33,711 --> 01:25:38,924
Tell me where to put your bed.
Come on.

1001
01:25:40,135 --> 01:25:44,221
I'll sleep with Luca there,
and you three will sleep here.

1002
01:25:44,305 --> 01:25:48,976
Simone, Ciro,
and you, my sweet boy!

1003
01:25:52,105 --> 01:25:59,194
You know... Ciro's been so wonderful,
you can't imagine.

1004
01:26:02,532 --> 01:26:05,659
They're at the christening
of Vincenzo's baby.

1005
01:26:06,494 --> 01:26:09,037
- Why aren't you?
- No, not me.

1006
01:26:09,122 --> 01:26:12,499
- Why is that?
- I was waiting for you to arrive.

1007
01:26:12,584 --> 01:26:15,794
That's no reason,
I could've joined you.

1008
01:26:15,879 --> 01:26:20,757
- Let's go there now.
- No, it's too late now.

1009
01:26:24,387 --> 01:26:27,764
You're not still angry
with Vincenzo, are you?

1010
01:26:27,849 --> 01:26:32,352
No, no.
He always comes to visit me.

1011
01:26:33,771 --> 01:26:37,107
- And Ginetta?
- Ginetta? No.

1012
01:26:38,943 --> 01:26:41,945
Not even now
that she's had a baby?

1013
01:26:42,030 --> 01:26:45,866
Do you think her parents
invite your brother round?

1014
01:26:46,910 --> 01:26:50,287
Let me go.
I'd like to see them.

1015
01:26:53,124 --> 01:26:54,583
Go, then.

1016
01:26:55,793 --> 01:26:57,836
Thanks.

1017
01:27:18,691 --> 01:27:22,819
- Ciao, Luca. Ciao, Vincenzo.
- Ciao, Rocco.

1018
01:27:24,781 --> 01:27:27,032
Ciao, Ginetta.
He's so handsome!

1019
01:27:27,116 --> 01:27:30,786
- We named him Antonio.
- Antonio, like Papa.

1020
01:27:30,870 --> 01:27:33,247
- May I hold him?
- Of course.

1021
01:27:35,875 --> 01:27:41,672
Antonio.
What a lovely baby! Antonio!

1022
01:27:41,798 --> 01:27:45,425
Move it!
Get the lead out of your legs!

1023
01:27:45,510 --> 01:27:47,427
Pure lead!

1024
01:27:52,475 --> 01:27:55,811
Don't make me use gloves
just before the fight.

1025
01:27:55,895 --> 01:27:59,022
I know what's best for you!

1026
01:27:59,107 --> 01:28:02,776
I can't get him to understand
what he's up against.

1027
01:28:02,860 --> 01:28:05,904
- Someone who hits hard.
- I told him.

1028
01:28:05,989 --> 01:28:09,783
- That's what you always say.
- This time it's true!

1029
01:28:09,867 --> 01:28:14,204
A guy's got a chance
if he's fast. But you're not.

1030
01:28:15,915 --> 01:28:18,583
Well, then it's your fault.

1031
01:28:18,668 --> 01:28:22,004
I never spar with anybody fast.

1032
01:28:22,130 --> 01:28:24,840
Sure, sure.

1033
01:28:26,759 --> 01:28:32,431
I'll find the right guy.
Rocco, put some gloves on.

1034
01:28:32,515 --> 01:28:34,850
Come on!

1035
01:28:34,934 --> 01:28:36,476
- Me?
- Yes.

1036
01:28:36,602 --> 01:28:39,604
- Very funny.
- Let him try.

1037
01:28:39,689 --> 01:28:44,067
Yeah, try staying
on his feet tomorrow!

1038
01:28:44,152 --> 01:28:46,028
Put some gloves on.

1039
01:28:46,112 --> 01:28:49,614
Jab, left, left...

1040
01:28:54,037 --> 01:28:57,247
Look,
I'm up against clowns!

1041
01:29:02,086 --> 01:29:04,963
Sacks of potatoes,
that's all they are!

1042
01:29:05,048 --> 01:29:09,468
We'll be a laughing stock tomorrow.
Shitheads!

1043
01:29:09,552 --> 01:29:13,013
What a brainless bunch!

1044
01:29:14,515 --> 01:29:18,268
I'm through! I've had enough!
I've had it!

1045
01:29:18,353 --> 01:29:21,188
I want real boxers who care!

1046
01:29:21,272 --> 01:29:24,274
You're clodhoppers!
These Milanese are right.

1047
01:29:24,359 --> 01:29:26,943
Dirt-pushers, I can do without you!

1048
01:29:27,028 --> 01:29:29,112
Hey, come take a look, come on.

1049
01:29:29,197 --> 01:29:30,822
- Cerri!
- What?

1050
01:29:30,907 --> 01:29:33,033
- Take a look.
- I want to see nothing!

1051
01:29:33,117 --> 01:29:37,245
- Come and have a look.
- I don't want to see anything.

1052
01:29:37,330 --> 01:29:42,125
- Come on!
- No, I don't feel like it... No!

1053
01:29:42,210 --> 01:29:45,170
- It's worth it, Cerri!
- To see what?

1054
01:29:45,254 --> 01:29:48,298
- A real spectacle!
- Oh, yeah?

1055
01:29:53,012 --> 01:29:57,265
See that? Wonderful!
He woke up.

1056
01:29:57,350 --> 01:29:59,142
Magnificent!

1057
01:30:00,686 --> 01:30:04,773
Good, work him like that.
Listen to me.

1058
01:30:05,983 --> 01:30:09,778
That's it, good, good.

1059
01:30:09,904 --> 01:30:11,988
Hold on, I'm coming.

1060
01:30:12,073 --> 01:30:13,990
Use your left.

1061
01:30:14,075 --> 01:30:19,871
Come on, Simone! Wake up! Simone!

1062
01:30:19,956 --> 01:30:22,541
- That kid...
- He's not bad.

1063
01:30:22,625 --> 01:30:24,793
He's not bad at all!

1064
01:30:24,877 --> 01:30:28,380
He's good.
Look how well he dodges punches.

1065
01:30:28,464 --> 01:30:30,549
Go on, get him!

1066
01:30:32,635 --> 01:30:38,807
Leave things up to me before a fight,
understand? I get nervous!

1067
01:30:38,891 --> 01:30:43,937
- You get up there with Rocco.
- Your turn, Dal Piaz.

1068
01:30:45,731 --> 01:30:48,233
Time! Let's go.

1069
01:30:49,318 --> 01:30:51,445
He boxes real nice.

1070
01:30:51,529 --> 01:30:56,950
Simone, watch it,
or he'll grab your place.

1071
01:30:58,453 --> 01:31:00,078
Tomorrow, huh?

1072
01:31:00,204 --> 01:31:04,791
Yeah, tomorrow we'll see
if you do like I say.

1073
01:31:07,044 --> 01:31:09,754
Well done!
You've made real progress.

1074
01:31:10,631 --> 01:31:15,093
In the army,
we'd work out together.

1075
01:31:15,178 --> 01:31:18,180
- I even fought a few matches.
- How did you get on?

1076
01:31:18,264 --> 01:31:20,182
Two draws and a win...

1077
01:31:20,266 --> 01:31:22,767
- Ah!
- ...but it's not for me.

1078
01:31:22,852 --> 01:31:24,519
- You don't like it?
- No.

1079
01:31:24,645 --> 01:31:26,438
I'm going now, it's late.

1080
01:31:26,522 --> 01:31:29,107
- Have a massage first.
- OK.

1081
01:31:31,736 --> 01:31:33,695
- What's up?
- Nothing.

1082
01:32:37,385 --> 01:32:41,930
Hey, Simone!
Get back to where you came from!

1083
01:33:28,436 --> 01:33:30,520
I can't take any more.

1084
01:33:32,773 --> 01:33:36,067
- Throw in the towel.
- Don't give up now, you fool.

1085
01:33:36,152 --> 01:33:38,111
- Throw in the towel.
- Don't give up.

1086
01:33:38,195 --> 01:33:40,238
I can't take any more.

1087
01:33:45,369 --> 01:33:48,371
Listen to me. There's only
one thing you can do:

1088
01:33:48,456 --> 01:33:51,541
use your left, understand?
Your left!

1089
01:33:51,626 --> 01:33:54,628
- I can't take it.
- Not the right!

1090
01:34:17,902 --> 01:34:20,070
- Throw in the towel.
- Don't quit now!

1091
01:34:20,154 --> 01:34:24,032
- 5, 6, 7, 8.
- The towel!

1092
01:34:46,514 --> 01:34:49,265
Breathe deeply.

1093
01:34:50,518 --> 01:34:53,853
Damn! It was a draw up to now.

1094
01:34:53,938 --> 01:34:59,693
He had to quit in the middle of a match?
I shouldn't have thrown it in.

1095
01:34:59,777 --> 01:35:04,072
After seven rounds,
the winner is Webster.

1096
01:35:06,200 --> 01:35:08,118
Don't blame him.

1097
01:35:08,202 --> 01:35:12,539
What's the use?
I'll blame who I damn please!

1098
01:35:12,623 --> 01:35:16,459
I'm the one that suffers, not him!
Who gives a damn about him?

1099
01:35:16,544 --> 01:35:20,964
My reputation, my interests,
are at stake here, not his!

1100
01:35:21,048 --> 01:35:22,716
It's all over now.

1101
01:35:22,842 --> 01:35:25,093
That was a great show by your brother!

1102
01:35:25,177 --> 01:35:28,805
I found him changed
when I came back from the service.

1103
01:35:28,889 --> 01:35:32,475
Stop defending him,
we both know how things went.

1104
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:37,397
As things stand now,
I reckon you owe me.

1105
01:35:37,481 --> 01:35:44,195
You owe me for all the trouble
that your brother has caused me.

1106
01:35:44,280 --> 01:35:47,157
Eh? Agreed?

1107
01:35:48,367 --> 01:35:50,326
How come your boy lost?

1108
01:35:53,706 --> 01:35:55,832
He's made mincemeat of you.

1109
01:35:55,916 --> 01:35:58,251
Shut up!

1110
01:35:58,335 --> 01:36:00,170
Your attention, please...

1111
01:36:00,254 --> 01:36:04,924
- Did you hear what they were saying?
- Oh, nothing much.

1112
01:36:06,177 --> 01:36:09,304
Cerri threw a fit, as usual.

1113
01:36:09,388 --> 01:36:12,807
He wasn't wrong,
but he calmed down.

1114
01:36:14,393 --> 01:36:18,563
He even said he was going
to try your brother out.

1115
01:36:18,647 --> 01:36:20,648
Who? Rocco?

1116
01:36:22,151 --> 01:36:26,863
If your brother accepts,
he'll have to watch it too.

1117
01:36:30,743 --> 01:36:33,286
With the whores, I mean.

1118
01:36:33,370 --> 01:36:36,831
On that score,
he's the world champion.

1119
01:36:38,501 --> 01:36:42,086
What about that whore
that messed you around?

1120
01:36:44,173 --> 01:36:46,508
Don't tell me you don't know?

1121
01:36:46,592 --> 01:36:51,638
The whole town knows about
your brother and his great love.

1122
01:36:51,722 --> 01:36:54,557
They're seen together all the time.

1123
01:36:57,728 --> 01:36:59,854
I checked up on him.

1124
01:36:59,939 --> 01:37:04,150
He hangs out
around the Ghisolfa, at night.

1125
01:37:06,862 --> 01:37:09,697
With that Nadia.

1126
01:37:12,618 --> 01:37:16,120
Come on, Simone, don't tell me
you didn't know?

1127
01:37:18,624 --> 01:37:24,045
- No, I didn't.
- Well, they say she's in love.

1128
01:37:24,129 --> 01:37:27,966
Rossi's the one who told me.
You remember him?

1129
01:37:28,050 --> 01:37:30,802
Nadia was crazy about him.

1130
01:37:30,886 --> 01:37:34,430
Now she turns her back on him
and everybody else.

1131
01:37:36,267 --> 01:37:39,853
She's going
to some secretarial school.

1132
01:37:41,188 --> 01:37:43,731
A real Saint Agnes.

1133
01:37:45,818 --> 01:37:47,569
Stop that!

1134
01:38:28,485 --> 01:38:31,112
- Who's paying the bet?
- Pay up. I won.

1135
01:38:31,196 --> 01:38:33,823
And one coffee, I'm freezing.

1136
01:38:33,908 --> 01:38:36,326
- One coffee!
- Laced with grappa.

1137
01:38:38,746 --> 01:38:43,458
- So?
- So I followed him

1138
01:38:43,542 --> 01:38:46,085
and he was with a blonde.

1139
01:38:46,962 --> 01:38:50,840
- Whereabouts?
- Over by the viaduct.

1140
01:38:50,925 --> 01:38:56,346
They all go there,
near where the trains pass.

1141
01:38:56,430 --> 01:38:59,974
We could be wrong,
maybe it isn't her.

1142
01:39:01,143 --> 01:39:04,687
Don't be an idiot,
it's her, all right.

1143
01:39:07,066 --> 01:39:10,360
OK, let's go.

1144
01:39:10,444 --> 01:39:13,446
And Camisasca? Riguttini?

1145
01:39:13,530 --> 01:39:17,742
They're following them, they're
probably at the sanatorium by now.

1146
01:39:17,826 --> 01:39:20,662
Wait, I'll get my bike and show you.

1147
01:39:25,709 --> 01:39:29,003
How can they make out
in this weather?

1148
01:39:29,088 --> 01:39:30,922
Move it!

1149
01:39:31,006 --> 01:39:33,633
Hey, Romeo, over here!

1150
01:39:40,599 --> 01:39:44,560
- Are they there?
- They're there. Let's go.

1151
01:39:44,645 --> 01:39:47,647
If it's not them, you've had it!

1152
01:40:06,250 --> 01:40:09,419
They went down
by the shack, just now.

1153
01:40:12,506 --> 01:40:17,760
You go along the river,
and I'll go this way, right?

1154
01:40:17,845 --> 01:40:20,847
And wait for my signal, right? Go.

1155
01:40:22,224 --> 01:40:24,308
- You're going alone?
- Yes.

1156
01:41:51,522 --> 01:41:53,606
Hear that? What was it?

1157
01:41:54,441 --> 01:41:58,277
It's nothing, probably a cat.

1158
01:42:01,698 --> 01:42:03,533
Don't move.

1159
01:42:03,617 --> 01:42:05,368
Leave her alone!

1160
01:42:05,452 --> 01:42:08,663
What's wrong?
I can see who I like.

1161
01:42:13,043 --> 01:42:16,170
Not her, she was mine.

1162
01:42:18,048 --> 01:42:22,927
I won't have you seeing her.
Understand? Do you understand?

1163
01:42:25,013 --> 01:42:29,350
It's over between you two.
You haven't seen her in two years!

1164
01:42:36,233 --> 01:42:37,900
Come on, Rocco.

1165
01:42:46,660 --> 01:42:50,621
What's going on?
What do you want, Simone?

1166
01:42:50,706 --> 01:42:52,331
What do you want?

1167
01:42:52,416 --> 01:42:54,750
First, an apology from Rocco.

1168
01:43:00,757 --> 01:43:02,216
Why?

1169
01:43:04,219 --> 01:43:06,721
You coward!

1170
01:43:06,805 --> 01:43:09,307
- Look, he lets a woman protect him.
- You animal.

1171
01:43:09,433 --> 01:43:13,811
Ask my forgiveness.
Ask my forgiveness!

1172
01:43:13,896 --> 01:43:19,525
- Can't you see? He's drunk.
- I said, ask my forgiveness!

1173
01:43:21,195 --> 01:43:23,196
Stop!

1174
01:43:23,280 --> 01:43:26,532
- Don't, Simone!
- I'll do what I want.

1175
01:43:26,617 --> 01:43:29,076
- No!
- Being cheated on by him!

1176
01:43:31,580 --> 01:43:37,627
Take a look at your Nadia!
At how she makes love!

1177
01:43:41,590 --> 01:43:45,885
Let him see you
for what you really are!

1178
01:43:46,011 --> 01:43:48,930
Hold on to him! Make him watch.

1179
01:43:49,014 --> 01:43:51,766
- He has to learn.
- Rocco! Rocco!

1180
01:43:51,850 --> 01:43:56,354
No, Simone, don't do it!

1181
01:43:56,438 --> 01:43:58,814
Rocco, help me!

1182
01:43:58,899 --> 01:44:00,775
Simone, no!

1183
01:44:00,859 --> 01:44:03,444
Simone, don't!

1184
01:44:08,116 --> 01:44:10,159
- There, got them!
- Rocco!

1185
01:44:10,244 --> 01:44:12,620
- Kiss them if you can.
- No! Rocco!

1186
01:44:12,704 --> 01:44:15,831
You only know how to make love
with these.

1187
01:44:20,629 --> 01:44:22,588
Rocco, help me! Simone, don't!

1188
01:44:22,714 --> 01:44:24,548
Simone!

1189
01:45:22,899 --> 01:45:25,651
Say something. Tell me it's...

1190
01:45:25,736 --> 01:45:29,071
Rocco, tell me that it's...

1191
01:46:18,455 --> 01:46:21,123
You learned your lesson!

1192
01:46:21,208 --> 01:46:23,542
We'll discuss it at home.

1193
01:46:28,215 --> 01:46:30,299
You disgust me.

1194
01:46:31,301 --> 01:46:33,969
I dare you to repeat that.

1195
01:46:35,722 --> 01:46:37,807
You disgust me.

1196
01:46:39,684 --> 01:46:41,310
Enough, Simone!

1197
01:46:43,063 --> 01:46:45,439
You're my brother,
I can't help that!

1198
01:46:45,524 --> 01:46:51,195
But that didn't stop you.
It does now because you're afraid.

1199
01:46:52,239 --> 01:46:54,323
I'm not afraid.

1200
01:46:54,950 --> 01:46:58,661
No? Then come and show me.

1201
01:47:02,165 --> 01:47:04,458
Are you crazy?
Someone might show up.

1202
01:47:04,543 --> 01:47:06,001
Out of my way!

1203
01:47:20,183 --> 01:47:21,934
Simone, stop!

1204
01:49:43,076 --> 01:49:45,869
Come on, get in.

1205
01:50:17,277 --> 01:50:18,944
Vincenzo.

1206
01:50:19,029 --> 01:50:23,657
Vincenzo, the doorbell...
The doorbell!

1207
01:50:23,742 --> 01:50:26,118
- Doorbell?
- Go see who's there.

1208
01:50:26,202 --> 01:50:28,078
Go on!

1209
01:50:40,717 --> 01:50:42,259
Rocco!

1210
01:50:42,344 --> 01:50:44,470
What happened?

1211
01:50:46,556 --> 01:50:50,267
- Ginetta, look.
- What happened?

1212
01:51:01,946 --> 01:51:03,822
What happened to you?

1213
01:51:04,949 --> 01:51:07,660
Nothing... nothing.

1214
01:51:09,162 --> 01:51:11,914
- Vincenzo...
- Yes?

1215
01:51:11,998 --> 01:51:14,333
- Let me stay here with you.
- Yes.

1216
01:51:16,211 --> 01:51:18,420
Let them know at home,

1217
01:51:20,590 --> 01:51:22,883
otherwise Mama will be worried.

1218
01:51:25,970 --> 01:51:28,138
Oh, God! He's passed out.

1219
01:51:28,223 --> 01:51:31,058
Ginetta, some water, hurry.

1220
01:51:37,941 --> 01:51:41,527
How could I know
Simone loved you so much?

1221
01:51:43,488 --> 01:51:46,657
I knew something
had changed in him...

1222
01:51:47,409 --> 01:51:49,535
in his good nature.

1223
01:51:52,247 --> 01:51:55,708
But I didn't know that
you were the reason.

1224
01:51:56,710 --> 01:52:00,421
It's not true, Rocco... not true.

1225
01:52:00,505 --> 01:52:06,218
Only a man who's become desperate
would do what he did the other night.

1226
01:52:06,344 --> 01:52:11,140
He's vile, cruel.
I love you. Don't you believe me?

1227
01:52:11,224 --> 01:52:15,352
Then it's all useless.
I can't believe in anything.

1228
01:52:15,437 --> 01:52:18,939
If you keep on like this,
I'll jump.

1229
01:52:19,023 --> 01:52:21,650
- I'll kill myself!
- Nadia, listen.

1230
01:52:21,735 --> 01:52:23,819
Nadia, stop!

1231
01:52:25,405 --> 01:52:28,282
- Nadia, listen...
- Let go of me!

1232
01:52:28,366 --> 01:52:30,909
- I want to die!
- Nadia!

1233
01:52:31,995 --> 01:52:35,789
- Listen.
- Leave me alone, I beg you.

1234
01:52:43,923 --> 01:52:46,175
You helped me understand

1235
01:52:46,259 --> 01:52:51,305
how loathsome my life had
become. I learned to love you.

1236
01:52:52,640 --> 01:52:56,310
And now, because of the brutality
of that coward...

1237
01:52:56,394 --> 01:53:00,856
He humiliated me in front of you
to bring us down to his level.

1238
01:53:00,982 --> 01:53:04,568
All of a sudden,
nothing is the same.

1239
01:53:05,862 --> 01:53:09,948
What was beautiful and right
is now wrong.

1240
01:53:12,869 --> 01:53:16,538
We're both guilty.
Especially me.

1241
01:53:19,375 --> 01:53:22,503
- Go back to Simone.
- Are you serious?

1242
01:53:24,214 --> 01:53:26,757
Simone needs you.

1243
01:53:26,841 --> 01:53:30,636
He needs me, I know.
And then what?

1244
01:53:30,720 --> 01:53:33,514
Don't I count for anything, Rocco?

1245
01:53:33,598 --> 01:53:35,307
What shall we do?

1246
01:53:37,393 --> 01:53:39,520
You're the only one
who can help Simone.

1247
01:53:39,646 --> 01:53:42,189
This is madness!

1248
01:53:55,912 --> 01:54:02,751
We thought we were starting afresh.
Instead we were only doing harm.

1249
01:54:02,836 --> 01:54:05,963
I'll go to church
if I want to hear sermons.

1250
01:54:06,047 --> 01:54:08,090
I love you, Rocco.

1251
01:54:09,008 --> 01:54:12,302
And you love me.
What will become of our love?

1252
01:54:12,387 --> 01:54:14,972
Why torture me like this?

1253
01:54:18,142 --> 01:54:20,185
We must stop.

1254
01:54:23,648 --> 01:54:25,941
That's not possible.

1255
01:54:26,025 --> 01:54:28,193
That's not possible, Rocco.

1256
01:54:32,365 --> 01:54:35,701
If that's what you want...
But you'll regret it.

1257
01:54:36,911 --> 01:54:39,496
You'll be sorry when it's too late!

1258
01:54:39,581 --> 01:54:42,457
I hate you! I hate you! I hate you!

1259
01:54:55,722 --> 01:54:57,180
No luck tonight.

1260
01:55:00,393 --> 01:55:02,144
The house wins.

1261
01:55:02,228 --> 01:55:06,398
Place your bets, please.
Rien ne va plus, plus rien.

1262
01:55:08,026 --> 01:55:09,484
One card.

1263
01:55:16,200 --> 01:55:19,995
- Let's hope this time, huh?
- The bank pays. Pass.

1264
01:55:27,378 --> 01:55:30,839
Quiet, please! We're playing here.

1265
01:55:33,051 --> 01:55:36,386
And me, like an idiot up there,

1266
01:55:36,471 --> 01:55:42,893
with all the Madonnas and Saints,
crying away, in despair.

1267
01:55:42,977 --> 01:55:44,853
What a sight!

1268
01:55:44,938 --> 01:55:49,149
Poor Nadia. You'll get over it.
Forget all about it.

1269
01:55:49,275 --> 01:55:51,193
Forget, right!

1270
01:55:59,494 --> 01:56:01,370
I'm hurting.

1271
01:56:03,456 --> 01:56:06,959
And there's someone hurting
just like me.

1272
01:56:10,713 --> 01:56:14,758
Look who's here!
The cause of all our pain.

1273
01:56:16,302 --> 01:56:18,512
The "real" victim!

1274
01:56:21,474 --> 01:56:24,726
- What's with her?
- We brought him to ruin.

1275
01:56:24,811 --> 01:56:27,813
We brought him to ruin,
can you imagine?

1276
01:56:27,897 --> 01:56:29,856
I beg your pardon.

1277
01:56:30,775 --> 01:56:33,110
Are you crazy?

1278
01:56:34,070 --> 01:56:36,113
Crazy?

1279
01:56:37,031 --> 01:56:40,784
Yes, I'm the crazy one.

1280
01:56:40,868 --> 01:56:44,371
That's what your brother said.

1281
01:56:44,455 --> 01:56:46,665
Yes, Rocco, his brother.

1282
01:56:46,749 --> 01:56:49,292
Know what he said to me?

1283
01:56:49,377 --> 01:56:53,922
"Go back to him, console him."

1284
01:56:54,757 --> 01:56:57,592
He's unhappy, the poor thing.

1285
01:56:57,677 --> 01:57:01,847
He can't make it alone.
He needs someone's help.

1286
01:57:01,973 --> 01:57:07,227
Please, we don't want trouble.
If she's drunk, take her away.

1287
01:57:07,311 --> 01:57:10,355
I beg your pardon? Ask me nicely.

1288
01:57:10,440 --> 01:57:13,567
I'm a lady,
so treat me accordingly.

1289
01:57:13,651 --> 01:57:18,030
- You can't just kick me out.
- Calm down.

1290
01:57:19,240 --> 01:57:21,700
- Did you hear him, kicking me out?
- Calm down.

1291
01:57:21,784 --> 01:57:24,619
It's not the first time
someone's tried that.

1292
01:57:24,704 --> 01:57:28,165
- Keep your mouth shut!
- Calm down.

1293
01:57:29,083 --> 01:57:33,336
So you're coming back to me?
I'm ready if you are.

1294
01:57:33,421 --> 01:57:36,631
Back with you? Never!

1295
01:57:37,675 --> 01:57:41,136
I hate you.
Yes, I hate you.

1296
01:57:42,055 --> 01:57:44,056
Never!

1297
01:57:44,140 --> 01:57:46,224
I'd rather die first!

1298
01:57:47,143 --> 01:57:51,354
I warn you, come near me
and I'll spit in your face.

1299
01:57:51,439 --> 01:57:53,940
In front of everybody,
I'll spit in your face.

1300
01:57:54,025 --> 01:57:56,735
Don't come any nearer.

1301
01:57:56,819 --> 01:58:00,363
- Stop making trouble, both of you!
- Leave her to me.

1302
01:58:01,324 --> 01:58:03,992
Don't come any closer.

1303
01:58:07,705 --> 01:58:10,707
- What do you want?
- Come here.

1304
01:58:10,792 --> 01:58:13,168
- Let me go!
- Come on.

1305
01:58:13,252 --> 01:58:15,879
Sure, with Rocco's permission.

1306
01:58:15,963 --> 01:58:17,547
Let's go.

1307
01:58:18,674 --> 01:58:20,884
For an hour or forever?

1308
01:58:21,010 --> 01:58:24,971
- Forever, if that's what you want.
- Why not, eh?

1309
01:58:26,265 --> 01:58:29,434
You or someone else,
it makes no difference.

1310
01:58:30,561 --> 01:58:33,688
Let's go, come on.

1311
01:58:33,773 --> 01:58:35,315
Let's go!

1312
01:58:38,027 --> 01:58:40,362
- Come on!
- No...

1313
01:58:40,446 --> 01:58:43,406
No, forget it,
I never loved you.

1314
01:59:32,999 --> 01:59:35,000
Seconds out...

1315
01:59:36,586 --> 01:59:41,256
Keep your guard up
and hit his bad eye

1316
01:59:41,340 --> 01:59:43,592
where the cut is.

1317
01:59:46,220 --> 01:59:48,597
Let him have it, understand?

1318
01:59:48,723 --> 01:59:51,558
Round three, last round.

1319
02:00:49,867 --> 02:00:52,535
Rocco! Rocco!

1320
02:01:25,236 --> 02:01:28,822
Your attention, please.
Attention!

1321
02:01:28,906 --> 02:01:33,451
By a knockout,
the winner is Rocco Parondi

1322
02:01:33,536 --> 02:01:36,037
representing the Italian team

1323
02:01:39,625 --> 02:01:42,460
Rocco! Rocco!

1324
02:02:22,418 --> 02:02:25,420
You, out! Out!

1325
02:02:41,604 --> 02:02:43,938
Are you all right, Rocco?

1326
02:02:44,899 --> 02:02:47,567
Winning came easy, Ciro,

1327
02:02:48,277 --> 02:02:50,612
because I wasn't fighting him,

1328
02:02:52,865 --> 02:02:57,118
but someone who drew
the hatred out of me,

1329
02:02:57,787 --> 02:03:02,624
the hatred that has grown
inside me without my knowledge.

1330
02:03:04,919 --> 02:03:07,003
It's a bad feeling.

1331
02:03:08,214 --> 02:03:11,049
You can't imagine how bad it is.

1332
02:03:12,218 --> 02:03:17,597
How's that possible, Rocco?
There's nothing bad in you.

1333
02:03:17,681 --> 02:03:20,392
Come on, Rocco, cheer up!

1334
02:03:20,476 --> 02:03:24,771
You'll make a great champion,
a real champion.

1335
02:03:49,046 --> 02:03:52,841
Ciro, that's enough,
my father's waiting.

1336
02:03:53,592 --> 02:03:55,760
- Come on.
- My father's waiting...

1337
02:03:55,845 --> 02:03:59,389
I have something to tell you.

1338
02:03:59,515 --> 02:04:01,391
What is it?

1339
02:04:01,475 --> 02:04:03,893
- Do you love me?
- Yes.

1340
02:04:03,978 --> 02:04:05,895
Give me a kiss?

1341
02:04:05,980 --> 02:04:07,439
Here, Ciro?

1342
02:04:09,233 --> 02:04:10,817
Why not?

1343
02:04:25,749 --> 02:04:28,084
Papa's waiting for us.

1344
02:04:29,587 --> 02:04:31,129
Hi, Papa.

1345
02:04:31,922 --> 02:04:33,673
We've had such fun!

1346
02:04:33,757 --> 02:04:36,634
Ciao. Did you tell him?

1347
02:04:36,719 --> 02:04:42,140
I forgot. Papa said to come
over tomorrow night.

1348
02:04:42,224 --> 02:04:44,350
He wants to know if we're serious.

1349
02:04:44,435 --> 02:04:48,062
- I can answer that right now.
- No, tell me tomorrow.

1350
02:04:48,147 --> 02:04:51,399
Let's give him a chance
to escape before then! Ciao, Ciro.

1351
02:04:51,484 --> 02:04:53,485
See you tomorrow. Ciao.

1352
02:04:53,569 --> 02:04:56,279
- He seems a nice boy.
- Ciro!

1353
02:04:56,363 --> 02:05:00,408
- You're not going back to the dance?
- Of course not.

1354
02:05:00,493 --> 02:05:04,662
Go straight home, OK?
No dancing without me, ever! Ciao.

1355
02:05:06,290 --> 02:05:08,416
Get in, it's cold.

1356
02:05:14,840 --> 02:05:16,508
Ciao, Franca.

1357
02:05:25,601 --> 02:05:27,685
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

1358
02:05:27,770 --> 02:05:29,687
You're number four, eh?

1359
02:05:29,772 --> 02:05:32,273
We've already met. Remember?

1360
02:05:33,567 --> 02:05:37,904
She's Simone's woman.
He's back too. He's inside.

1361
02:05:37,988 --> 02:05:41,950
- Ciro, come here a minute!
- Coming, Mama.

1362
02:05:46,539 --> 02:05:51,251
- Are there no knives in this house?
- There they are.

1363
02:05:55,673 --> 02:05:58,299
Here's the cure
for your brother's hangover.

1364
02:05:58,425 --> 02:06:01,052
Ciro, my son...

1365
02:06:03,222 --> 02:06:06,683
Rest now. We'll settle
everything tomorrow.

1366
02:06:07,518 --> 02:06:09,602
Tomorrow? Tomorrow?

1367
02:06:09,687 --> 02:06:13,565
Do you think anything
will have changed by tomorrow?

1368
02:06:14,942 --> 02:06:21,656
Ciro, my dear son, tell me...
Tell me, is it all my fault?

1369
02:06:21,740 --> 02:06:27,370
Bringing my strong, handsome sons
here to better themselves,

1370
02:06:27,454 --> 02:06:30,873
and not toil upon a thankless land
like their father

1371
02:06:30,958 --> 02:06:34,210
who died a thousand times
before giving up.

1372
02:06:34,295 --> 02:06:36,963
You've done us proud, Ma.

1373
02:06:37,047 --> 02:06:41,134
Your father couldn't bring himself
to leave his land.

1374
02:06:41,218 --> 02:06:45,263
But during the 25 years
we spent together,

1375
02:06:45,347 --> 02:06:49,601
I thought of nothing but leaving,
leaving, leaving.

1376
02:06:49,685 --> 02:06:54,147
I wanted it for Vincenzo,
for Simone, for Rocco and for you.

1377
02:06:54,231 --> 02:06:58,776
Nothing seemed beautiful there.
That world was so small.

1378
02:06:58,861 --> 02:07:02,405
Here I felt
as if I could touch the sky.

1379
02:07:03,449 --> 02:07:08,328
Here, people on the street
called me "Madam"...

1380
02:07:08,412 --> 02:07:13,791
Me, "Madam",
here, in this big city!

1381
02:07:13,876 --> 02:07:15,960
And all thanks to my wonderful boys!

1382
02:07:16,962 --> 02:07:19,672
But now, everything's gone wrong.

1383
02:07:20,716 --> 02:07:26,304
Rocco's left home and acts
as though a curse is on him.

1384
02:07:26,388 --> 02:07:30,099
And Simone, my dear Simone,
lives with a whore!

1385
02:07:30,225 --> 02:07:32,769
- Want some?
- No.

1386
02:07:34,104 --> 02:07:36,397
Yeah, it's pretty revolting.

1387
02:07:40,069 --> 02:07:41,653
Don't cry.

1388
02:07:47,701 --> 02:07:49,994
I'll think of something.

1389
02:07:56,293 --> 02:07:58,336
Leave it to me, Ma.

1390
02:08:06,720 --> 02:08:09,138
I must talk with my brother.

1391
02:08:15,521 --> 02:08:19,941
You're irresponsible.
Show a little respect for our mother.

1392
02:08:21,860 --> 02:08:25,530
Look, I'm fed up
with all your preaching.

1393
02:08:28,242 --> 02:08:31,661
This is my house too,
and I bring who I want.

1394
02:08:34,915 --> 02:08:37,917
I already owe the hotel 60,000 lire.

1395
02:08:39,086 --> 02:08:41,212
Hey, you want to pay it?

1396
02:08:42,965 --> 02:08:45,049
Anyway, there's room here.

1397
02:08:45,676 --> 02:08:50,054
Rocco's staying with Vincenzo.
That gives us an extra bed.

1398
02:08:50,139 --> 02:08:52,181
Any objections?

1399
02:08:53,559 --> 02:08:56,686
- Leave me alone.
- We'll discuss it tomorrow.

1400
02:08:57,771 --> 02:09:03,401
No, we'll discuss it
when I feel like it. Understand?

1401
02:09:03,485 --> 02:09:06,696
Don't blame me for this situation.

1402
02:09:07,698 --> 02:09:12,744
The only one
who's losing out... is me.

1403
02:09:12,828 --> 02:09:15,496
Let's get that straight.

1404
02:09:16,707 --> 02:09:20,668
- You got a cigarette?
- I don't smoke.

1405
02:09:20,753 --> 02:09:23,713
Ah, he doesn't smoke.
I should've known.

1406
02:09:23,797 --> 02:09:29,844
He doesn't smoke,
but I do and I'm out of cigarettes.

1407
02:09:32,473 --> 02:09:35,850
Poor Mama, she even has
to make that woman's bed.

1408
02:09:38,896 --> 02:09:42,982
I know, I know...
I'm more ashamed than you.

1409
02:09:44,943 --> 02:09:47,028
Whether brothers or not...

1410
02:09:48,655 --> 02:09:54,535
we're seeds taken from the same
sack and meant to bear fruit.

1411
02:09:54,620 --> 02:09:57,830
A seed gone bad
must be weeded out,

1412
02:10:00,125 --> 02:10:02,502
like we did when cleaning lentils.

1413
02:10:04,463 --> 02:10:07,006
And none of this
is good for young Luca.

1414
02:10:07,132 --> 02:10:12,178
Simone hasn't changed,
he's just demoralised.

1415
02:10:12,262 --> 02:10:18,184
His pride has been wounded.
Let me try again, just once more.

1416
02:10:18,852 --> 02:10:20,937
I know what to do.

1417
02:10:22,564 --> 02:10:27,902
Cerri's very interested in me.
I'll fight for him.

1418
02:10:27,986 --> 02:10:31,781
He knows I might leave
if he lets Simone fight too.

1419
02:10:31,865 --> 02:10:33,991
I wouldn't do it, if...

1420
02:10:34,076 --> 02:10:37,411
Let me try, I'll manage somehow.

1421
02:10:38,539 --> 02:10:40,623
Do it for me.

1422
02:10:46,755 --> 02:10:49,465
If only we had never left home...

1423
02:10:51,677 --> 02:10:54,762
But it was our destiny...

1424
02:10:54,847 --> 02:10:57,265
yours and mine...

1425
02:10:58,559 --> 02:10:59,934
and Simone's.

1426
02:11:00,060 --> 02:11:03,896
Imagine the misery
if we'd stayed there, though.

1427
02:11:04,022 --> 02:11:07,108
But at least we'd still be close.

1428
02:11:07,192 --> 02:11:10,152
Rocco! We're here to work out!

1429
02:11:10,237 --> 02:11:11,779
Coming.

1430
02:11:17,119 --> 02:11:20,079
I'll never understand you, Rocco.

1431
02:11:20,163 --> 02:11:22,331
Yes, I know.

1432
02:11:33,552 --> 02:11:35,219
Can you see him?

1433
02:11:36,722 --> 02:11:39,390
That guy in the car?

1434
02:11:39,474 --> 02:11:42,602
- Tell him I'll be waiting at the bar.
- All right.

1435
02:11:53,363 --> 02:11:54,822
A cognac.

1436
02:12:05,292 --> 02:12:08,711
No fight tonight?
Or have you lost your nerve?

1437
02:12:08,795 --> 02:12:11,088
I don't feel good. Another.

1438
02:12:11,173 --> 02:12:13,674
Then why are you hanging out here?

1439
02:12:14,801 --> 02:12:16,260
Snap out of it!

1440
02:12:17,638 --> 02:12:21,682
How about a drink
in a nice quiet place, eh?

1441
02:12:25,604 --> 02:12:27,229
All right.

1442
02:12:28,106 --> 02:12:30,942
Simone, come on, it's late.

1443
02:12:31,026 --> 02:12:33,277
Go away. Leave me alone!

1444
02:12:40,452 --> 02:12:41,911
Got a cigarette?

1445
02:12:51,171 --> 02:12:53,381
These are for later.

1446
02:12:56,134 --> 02:12:57,593
Feel better?

1447
02:13:00,013 --> 02:13:02,223
I will when I'm far from here.

1448
02:13:02,307 --> 02:13:04,600
Have you got the fear?

1449
02:13:04,685 --> 02:13:09,689
It happens when you realise
that punches ruin your profile.

1450
02:13:11,149 --> 02:13:13,234
Where shall we go?

1451
02:13:14,194 --> 02:13:16,278
Your place?

1452
02:13:16,363 --> 02:13:19,532
I was sure you'd ask me one day.

1453
02:13:19,616 --> 02:13:21,701
- How much?
- 200 lire.

1454
02:13:24,329 --> 02:13:25,830
Thank you.

1455
02:13:25,914 --> 02:13:28,499
I see your courage is returning.

1456
02:13:31,294 --> 02:13:33,379
Better late than never.

1457
02:13:41,346 --> 02:13:44,306
How do you like my place?

1458
02:13:47,185 --> 02:13:48,894
Come on in.

1459
02:13:51,481 --> 02:13:54,108
This is your first time here, right?

1460
02:14:01,908 --> 02:14:03,784
How are you feeling?

1461
02:14:05,912 --> 02:14:07,788
Calmer now?

1462
02:14:37,903 --> 02:14:39,695
Have a seat.

1463
02:14:56,338 --> 02:14:59,423
Listen... I need money.

1464
02:15:00,967 --> 02:15:02,259
Lots.

1465
02:15:03,595 --> 02:15:05,679
I'm aware of that.

1466
02:15:15,690 --> 02:15:18,692
It's not the first time for you, is it?

1467
02:15:21,530 --> 02:15:23,531
The Champ!

1468
02:15:24,491 --> 02:15:29,745
I predicted it. I knew you couldn't last.

1469
02:15:31,540 --> 02:15:33,207
And to think...

1470
02:15:35,752 --> 02:15:39,797
when I first saw you
at "The Lombard Club", you were

1471
02:15:39,881 --> 02:15:44,135
an Apollo... a real Apollo.

1472
02:15:53,812 --> 02:15:58,607
You're through as a boxer.
And as a man.

1473
02:15:58,692 --> 02:16:03,445
Only somebody like me
can use a wreck like you.

1474
02:16:03,530 --> 02:16:06,949
- I need money.
- To pay for your whores?

1475
02:16:09,953 --> 02:16:14,748
That's one way to save face, isn't it?

1476
02:16:15,959 --> 02:16:18,002
I need a drink.

1477
02:16:18,086 --> 02:16:22,423
Help yourself, drink it all.
Nobody's weighing you in, after all.

1478
02:16:32,225 --> 02:16:34,852
I'll tell you straight:

1479
02:16:36,563 --> 02:16:39,190
you're a shit.

1480
02:16:39,274 --> 02:16:44,111
I don't need to hear that from you.
Not from you!

1481
02:16:44,196 --> 02:16:48,324
You can't talk to me like that,
understand?

1482
02:17:44,214 --> 02:17:47,508
- Ciro!
- Yeah, Ma.

1483
02:17:47,592 --> 02:17:50,636
- Come here. Hurry up!
- I'm coming.

1484
02:17:56,393 --> 02:17:59,812
- What is it, Ma?
- Just come here quickly!

1485
02:17:59,896 --> 02:18:03,774
- What's happened?
- They're looking for Simone.

1486
02:18:03,858 --> 02:18:08,904
- Who is?
- The police. They have a warrant.

1487
02:18:08,989 --> 02:18:14,285
- What's it all about?
- Go to your room, go on.

1488
02:18:16,538 --> 02:18:18,872
Don't worry.

1489
02:18:21,001 --> 02:18:25,754
Good morning. My brother Simone
didn't come home last night.

1490
02:18:25,839 --> 02:18:30,092
- Right...
- He rarely sleeps here, hardly ever.

1491
02:18:30,176 --> 02:18:33,387
- You can take a look.
- Never mind.

1492
02:18:33,471 --> 02:18:35,889
Why do you want him?

1493
02:18:35,974 --> 02:18:39,310
Our instructions are to bring him in.

1494
02:18:39,394 --> 02:18:43,856
There are charges against
Simone Parondi. That's all we know.

1495
02:18:43,940 --> 02:18:48,360
- I'll come with you and find out more.
- As you wish.

1496
02:18:48,445 --> 02:18:52,323
- Come in while I get dressed.
- You stay here.

1497
02:19:04,377 --> 02:19:06,211
This is Simone?

1498
02:19:06,296 --> 02:19:09,882
Yes, that's my brother,
when he was still boxing.

1499
02:19:09,966 --> 02:19:13,886
- Bravo.
- I'm ready if you are.

1500
02:19:16,681 --> 02:19:19,725
Ma, I'm going to the police station.

1501
02:19:25,315 --> 02:19:29,318
The police are after him.
What has he done? You know?

1502
02:19:30,862 --> 02:19:35,282
No, not this time,
but I can imagine.

1503
02:19:35,367 --> 02:19:39,370
He's rotten to the core,
and you know it's true.

1504
02:19:39,454 --> 02:19:44,750
How dare you say that
about my son? What nerve!

1505
02:19:44,834 --> 02:19:49,004
With you here, I'm ashamed to show
my face in the neighbourhood.

1506
02:19:49,089 --> 02:19:53,258
You allowed me to stay
only to keep Simone here with you.

1507
02:19:53,343 --> 02:19:56,011
I've been rotting here!

1508
02:19:56,096 --> 02:20:00,140
No, squatting here
is what you've been doing!

1509
02:20:00,225 --> 02:20:04,770
- Take your rags, and go!
- No! He promised to take care of me.

1510
02:20:04,854 --> 02:20:09,108
But he can't keep a woman like me.
He's just a bum!

1511
02:20:09,192 --> 02:20:13,404
He can't work, he can't even steal.
Yes, that's right, I said "steal"!

1512
02:20:14,614 --> 02:20:20,702
You whore! My son was the envy
of everyone and you ruined him.

1513
02:20:20,787 --> 02:20:24,623
When he gets rid of you,

1514
02:20:24,707 --> 02:20:29,336
he'll be back to his old self again.
May you be damned!

1515
02:20:29,421 --> 02:20:32,965
Don't do that!
Don't worry, I'm going.

1516
02:20:33,049 --> 02:20:37,094
- No, he must tell you when you can go.
- No!

1517
02:20:38,221 --> 02:20:41,890
Why should I stay?
Simone has hit rock bottom.

1518
02:20:41,975 --> 02:20:45,102
That's exactly what I wanted,
I'm happy now.

1519
02:20:45,186 --> 02:20:49,565
Make Rocco understand
how useless our sacrifice was.

1520
02:20:49,649 --> 02:20:51,984
I've no desire to tell him myself.

1521
02:20:52,068 --> 02:20:56,238
I want to go, and never see
any of you again.

1522
02:20:56,322 --> 02:20:58,740
Out! Out! Get out...

1523
02:21:03,121 --> 02:21:05,247
He thought I was afraid of him.

1524
02:21:05,331 --> 02:21:09,042
I warned him, "You touch that money
and I'll report you".

1525
02:21:09,127 --> 02:21:11,253
He just started laughing.

1526
02:21:11,337 --> 02:21:14,590
I watched him break open the drawer.

1527
02:21:23,683 --> 02:21:27,603
Tell them you found the money,
that you'd misplaced it.

1528
02:21:27,729 --> 02:21:31,940
I'll sign an IOU.
Cerri will guarantee for me.

1529
02:21:33,485 --> 02:21:38,071
You really think
I'd risk going to the police

1530
02:21:38,156 --> 02:21:40,866
for a lousy 60 or 70,000 lire?

1531
02:21:47,582 --> 02:21:52,961
For a year now, he's been taking
advantage of my generosity.

1532
02:21:53,046 --> 02:21:56,840
Tell me what he owes you,
and that'll be the end of it!

1533
02:21:57,675 --> 02:22:02,262
It's not just the money.
I stuck my neck out,

1534
02:22:02,347 --> 02:22:07,559
I covered for him
with a band of smugglers.

1535
02:22:07,644 --> 02:22:10,979
I asked you how much he owes!

1536
02:22:17,570 --> 02:22:19,446
400,000.

1537
02:22:31,376 --> 02:22:35,546
Very well, I'll pay with notes
in three months.

1538
02:22:39,050 --> 02:22:41,885
Are you crazy? We'll be ruined.

1539
02:22:41,970 --> 02:22:45,264
Don't count on me, I can't help you.

1540
02:22:45,348 --> 02:22:49,560
Ginetta's expecting,
and we've got furniture instalments.

1541
02:22:52,605 --> 02:22:55,148
This concerns only me.

1542
02:22:55,233 --> 02:22:59,027
But where are you going to find
all that money?

1543
02:23:03,950 --> 02:23:07,286
Vincenzo, tell him that
he's not talking sense.

1544
02:23:07,370 --> 02:23:11,832
I have told him.
I'm just sorry that I can't help.

1545
02:23:12,792 --> 02:23:15,961
I've got a family to support,
you know that.

1546
02:23:17,088 --> 02:23:19,798
You sure Cerri will guarantee for you?

1547
02:23:23,303 --> 02:23:25,387
You ask him.

1548
02:23:55,043 --> 02:23:59,338
It's still crazy, even if Cerri agrees.

1549
02:23:59,422 --> 02:24:02,132
How will you pay him back?

1550
02:24:07,221 --> 02:24:11,975
He promised me good money
if I sign for 10 years.

1551
02:24:13,186 --> 02:24:18,607
We'll go to Brussels, London...
Besides, what do you care?

1552
02:24:18,691 --> 02:24:20,567
Hello, is Cerri there?

1553
02:24:21,152 --> 02:24:22,903
Tell him it's Duilio.

1554
02:24:22,987 --> 02:24:25,697
You never wanted to box

1555
02:24:25,782 --> 02:24:30,160
and now you're going to ruin your life
for that delinquent?

1556
02:24:31,204 --> 02:24:33,622
Then tell me,

1557
02:24:33,706 --> 02:24:38,251
is there another way
to save Simone from his fate?

1558
02:24:38,336 --> 02:24:40,337
Yes, yes, hold on.

1559
02:24:43,132 --> 02:24:47,135
It's Cerri on the line.
You want to speak to him?

1560
02:24:47,220 --> 02:24:49,596
Rocco, think this over.

1561
02:24:51,307 --> 02:24:55,644
Wait. He's coming.

1562
02:25:08,449 --> 02:25:12,119
Cerri? Rocco.

1563
02:25:16,374 --> 02:25:19,084
Yes, of course. I understand that.

1564
02:25:20,128 --> 02:25:22,212
Yes, whatever you say.

1565
02:25:29,095 --> 02:25:33,807
We did what we could, Ciro.
Our conscience is clear.

1566
02:25:34,726 --> 02:25:40,439
When Rocco's set on something,
there's no stopping him, you know that.

1567
02:25:40,523 --> 02:25:42,482
Well, in fact...

1568
02:25:47,447 --> 02:25:50,782
In fact, I'm accepting all your terms.

1569
02:25:53,870 --> 02:25:55,370
Yes.

1570
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:00,792
All right.

1571
02:26:02,253 --> 02:26:03,712
Very well, tomorrow.

1572
02:26:04,464 --> 02:26:06,089
Yes, tomorrow.

1573
02:26:07,884 --> 02:26:09,176
Fine.

1574
02:26:11,220 --> 02:26:14,097
Four... and five.

1575
02:26:17,810 --> 02:26:22,981
This is for you,
but get out of Milan for a while.

1576
02:26:24,358 --> 02:26:27,360
You've got no job to lose.

1577
02:26:27,445 --> 02:26:30,030
Besides, any place
is the same to you.

1578
02:26:31,199 --> 02:26:33,700
Stay out of this house!

1579
02:26:35,369 --> 02:26:38,413
Is that what the "Court of Brothers"
decided?

1580
02:26:39,457 --> 02:26:42,542
- Who needs them?
- Just as well.

1581
02:26:51,093 --> 02:26:53,178
Let's make a pact.

1582
02:26:54,555 --> 02:26:59,184
Since you have money
for that bastard, Duilio...

1583
02:27:00,353 --> 02:27:03,980
maybe you've some "change"
for your brother.

1584
02:27:06,859 --> 02:27:10,612
200,000 lire, and I'll split for good.

1585
02:27:10,696 --> 02:27:14,282
I'll personally see that
you get another 100,000

1586
02:27:14,367 --> 02:27:16,326
as soon as Rocco collects.

1587
02:27:16,410 --> 02:27:20,580
He'll get another payment
after his next fight for Cerri.

1588
02:27:21,541 --> 02:27:23,416
Then I'll wait.

1589
02:27:24,627 --> 02:27:27,671
Come on, Luca, we're going.

1590
02:27:28,631 --> 02:27:30,507
Let him go!

1591
02:27:32,426 --> 02:27:34,970
- No!
- Cool it.

1592
02:27:36,973 --> 02:27:39,057
I don't have any disease.

1593
02:27:40,017 --> 02:27:42,394
Get off your high horse, Ciro.

1594
02:27:43,771 --> 02:27:46,147
Who are you, anyway?

1595
02:27:46,232 --> 02:27:50,110
Mr Skilled Worker
at the Alfa Romeo plant?

1596
02:27:50,194 --> 02:27:52,112
Some career that is!

1597
02:27:53,739 --> 02:27:56,616
He's even proud of it.

1598
02:27:56,701 --> 02:27:59,744
- You're pitiful.
- Get out of here!

1599
02:28:03,249 --> 02:28:05,333
- Hear that, Luca?
- Yes.

1600
02:28:05,418 --> 02:28:07,752
He said that I'm pitiful.

1601
02:28:07,837 --> 02:28:09,754
Luca, let's go!

1602
02:28:40,828 --> 02:28:43,663
Rocco! Rocco!

1603
02:28:46,667 --> 02:28:48,543
He's on his way.

1604
02:28:53,174 --> 02:28:54,925
- Did you sleep?
- An hour.

1605
02:28:55,843 --> 02:28:59,638
- How you feeling?
- He looks in good shape...

1606
02:29:04,977 --> 02:29:07,062
How about a rubdown?

1607
02:29:08,898 --> 02:29:11,775
A light massage, just a quick rub.

1608
02:29:11,859 --> 02:29:14,861
- He won't feel a thing.
- Rub his legs too.

1609
02:29:14,946 --> 02:29:18,323
- My left arm aches.
- It's nothing.

1610
02:29:18,407 --> 02:29:20,033
Hey, Simone!

1611
02:29:21,619 --> 02:29:24,955
Have you got any tickets for the fight?

1612
02:29:25,039 --> 02:29:27,707
You promised!

1613
02:29:33,547 --> 02:29:36,841
Have you got it in for me?
I promised you nothing.

1614
02:29:36,926 --> 02:29:38,760
I'm not going either.

1615
02:29:38,844 --> 02:29:42,013
Yeah, and it's killing you.

1616
02:29:45,184 --> 02:29:49,020
Poor guy, he's not going either!

1617
02:29:49,105 --> 02:29:52,482
Ever since he quit,
boxing makes him sick.

1618
02:29:54,110 --> 02:29:58,154
You quit? You don't throw
punches anymore?

1619
02:29:58,239 --> 02:30:00,991
No, I got tired of it.

1620
02:30:01,075 --> 02:30:04,369
You know the story
about the fox and sour grapes?

1621
02:30:04,453 --> 02:30:09,040
- No, I don't.
- Poor guy, he doesn't remember.

1622
02:30:09,125 --> 02:30:13,878
- Then let's refresh your memory.
- What's going on, guys?

1623
02:30:14,839 --> 02:30:16,673
- Ciao.
- Ciao, Ivo.

1624
02:30:19,010 --> 02:30:22,053
You want a cigarette?

1625
02:30:33,858 --> 02:30:39,154
Listen, some of us here
saw with our very own eyes

1626
02:30:39,238 --> 02:30:42,949
how he tamed
Rocco the champion.

1627
02:30:44,702 --> 02:30:49,039
Those who saw it
will never forget that night.

1628
02:30:49,123 --> 02:30:50,874
I was there.

1629
02:30:50,958 --> 02:30:55,170
I'd like to see the brothers
face each other now.

1630
02:30:55,254 --> 02:31:00,133
- Who'll bear the brunt this time?
- That's a thought.

1631
02:31:03,888 --> 02:31:08,808
We should stage it
over by the canal.

1632
02:31:10,019 --> 02:31:12,854
I heard recently

1633
02:31:12,938 --> 02:31:18,443
that Nadia's working together
with a woman near Ravizza

1634
02:31:18,527 --> 02:31:20,445
who rents out rooms and cars.

1635
02:31:20,529 --> 02:31:22,489
"Nadia, the motorised whore

1636
02:31:22,573 --> 02:31:26,951
"who does her clients
in a car along the canal!"

1637
02:31:27,703 --> 02:31:30,413
Ivo, are you sure?

1638
02:31:30,498 --> 02:31:33,708
Look, look! His ears have perked up.

1639
02:31:35,753 --> 02:31:41,049
If we wanted, we could organise
another night like before.

1640
02:31:42,134 --> 02:31:46,554
Is your brother still pining
for the motorised whore?

1641
02:31:46,639 --> 02:31:49,891
Or does he aim higher?

1642
02:31:51,018 --> 02:31:53,895
Simone, where you going?

1643
02:31:53,979 --> 02:31:55,855
Come back here.

1644
02:31:55,940 --> 02:31:58,399
Simone, where you going?

1645
02:32:03,197 --> 02:32:06,449
What a crowd!
All the champs are here!

1646
02:32:08,494 --> 02:32:10,620
You show them, Rocco!

1647
02:32:35,437 --> 02:32:38,898
Give me some water, I'm parched.

1648
02:32:38,983 --> 02:32:42,026
No, it'll bloat your stomach.

1649
02:32:42,111 --> 02:32:44,195
Then give me some lemon.

1650
02:34:06,987 --> 02:34:09,447
What is it?

1651
02:34:09,531 --> 02:34:11,658
Tell me, what is it?

1652
02:34:12,326 --> 02:34:15,954
Money? You want money?

1653
02:34:16,038 --> 02:34:19,082
I haven't got any. See, it's empty.

1654
02:34:19,166 --> 02:34:21,793
- I don't want your money.
- Don't come near me!

1655
02:34:21,877 --> 02:34:25,088
You can't say no to me.
Come back to me.

1656
02:34:25,172 --> 02:34:28,841
With you, I can start over again.

1657
02:34:28,926 --> 02:34:31,386
- Us two? Together again?
- Yes.

1658
02:34:31,470 --> 02:34:33,846
Impossible. Go, go away!

1659
02:34:33,931 --> 02:34:35,890
- Nadia...
- Go away!

1660
02:34:40,187 --> 02:34:42,522
Help! Help me!

1661
02:34:42,606 --> 02:34:46,776
No! Let me go! Help!

1662
02:34:49,697 --> 02:34:54,617
- Help! Help!
- Nadia, wait. Don't scream.

1663
02:34:54,702 --> 02:34:57,578
Help me! Leave me alone!

1664
02:34:57,663 --> 02:35:00,707
Don't leave me here! Help!

1665
02:35:00,791 --> 02:35:03,042
Nadia, cover yourself, it's cold.

1666
02:35:03,752 --> 02:35:06,921
Cover yourself. Don't scream.

1667
02:35:07,006 --> 02:35:09,090
You're shivering?
Don't be afraid.

1668
02:35:09,174 --> 02:35:12,176
Look how I'm shivering.
Don't be afraid.

1669
02:35:12,261 --> 02:35:14,470
I'm not afraid!
Leave me alone!

1670
02:35:14,555 --> 02:35:17,140
Honey, no! Nadia!

1671
02:35:26,025 --> 02:35:28,359
Why doesn't he cover himself?

1672
02:35:28,444 --> 02:35:30,570
He's bleeding again.

1673
02:35:31,488 --> 02:35:33,948
Get that left up!

1674
02:35:34,033 --> 02:35:35,825
Cover yourself! Cover yourself!

1675
02:35:36,452 --> 02:35:38,953
Cover yourself up, it's cold.

1676
02:35:39,913 --> 02:35:44,667
I made you suffer, my love...
My love...

1677
02:35:46,670 --> 02:35:48,671
You've no idea how much I hate you.

1678
02:35:49,715 --> 02:35:52,050
You're a beast.

1679
02:35:52,551 --> 02:35:56,346
Everything you touch
becomes foul

1680
02:35:56,430 --> 02:35:58,348
and vulgar.

1681
02:35:59,725 --> 02:36:02,477
I hope I never see you again.

1682
02:36:02,561 --> 02:36:04,771
Or hear of you again.

1683
02:36:06,482 --> 02:36:09,609
You ruined the only beautiful thing
in my life.

1684
02:36:10,736 --> 02:36:12,403
You! You criminal!

1685
02:36:15,449 --> 02:36:18,951
I spit in your face
all the loathing I feel for you.

1686
02:36:22,206 --> 02:36:25,291
Do what you want now,

1687
02:36:25,376 --> 02:36:27,585
I don't care anymore.

1688
02:38:14,193 --> 02:38:17,195
I don't want to die!

1689
02:39:25,556 --> 02:39:28,933
And the winner is Rocco Parondi!

1690
02:39:51,248 --> 02:39:54,667
I was scared when he clipped you.
Did it hurt?

1691
02:39:56,128 --> 02:40:00,756
For a while I couldn't see him.
It was like shadow boxing.

1692
02:40:00,841 --> 02:40:05,303
You could've come too, Ma.
It wouldn't have scared you.

1693
02:40:05,387 --> 02:40:07,263
- Are you happy?
- Delighted.

1694
02:40:07,347 --> 02:40:12,852
- To the future champion of Italy!
- Viva Rocco!

1695
02:40:12,936 --> 02:40:14,937
I'll be truly happy

1696
02:40:15,022 --> 02:40:20,401
the day when all my sons reunite
around this table

1697
02:40:20,485 --> 02:40:23,321
like the five fingers of my hand.

1698
02:40:23,405 --> 02:40:25,156
Come on, all of you.

1699
02:40:25,240 --> 02:40:29,493
I want you all to drink
to the health of my Rocco.

1700
02:40:29,786 --> 02:40:31,495
To your success.

1701
02:40:31,580 --> 02:40:34,498
Go get some sparkling wine!

1702
02:40:34,583 --> 02:40:36,500
We must celebrate.

1703
02:40:36,585 --> 02:40:40,421
And you, Vincenzo, make a nice toast.

1704
02:40:40,505 --> 02:40:42,965
Stand up, Vincenzo!

1705
02:40:50,223 --> 02:40:54,602
- Maria! Signora Lucia! Come along!
- The whole neighbourhood is out!

1706
02:40:54,728 --> 02:40:56,646
Come in, come in!

1707
02:40:58,649 --> 02:41:03,194
Come on, everybody.

1708
02:41:07,282 --> 02:41:11,285
Go on, Rocco!
Go on! Your health!

1709
02:41:15,707 --> 02:41:17,541
Your health!

1710
02:41:23,840 --> 02:41:28,719
Come on in, come on!
Come on in, everybody!

1711
02:41:28,804 --> 02:41:31,013
Have a seat.

1712
02:41:35,560 --> 02:41:37,895
Make yourselves at home.

1713
02:41:42,317 --> 02:41:44,443
Quiet! Quiet!

1714
02:41:44,528 --> 02:41:47,947
Vincenzo is going to make a toast.

1715
02:41:48,031 --> 02:41:51,158
- Go on, Vincenzo!
- What do I say?

1716
02:41:52,911 --> 02:41:54,787
Let's see...

1717
02:41:58,083 --> 02:42:02,837
Before I lose this rhyme,
let me think...

1718
02:42:02,921 --> 02:42:06,090
bottoms up,
with a sparkling drink!

1719
02:42:07,008 --> 02:42:09,927
Bravo, Vincenzo, that was lovely.

1720
02:42:11,805 --> 02:42:14,306
This wine, so fine and wonderful...

1721
02:42:15,934 --> 02:42:17,727
I drink to your health.

1722
02:42:17,811 --> 02:42:22,148
Ciro, shame on you!
They'd have shot you back home.

1723
02:42:22,274 --> 02:42:27,486
He's changed.
He's become citified like Ginetta.

1724
02:42:27,571 --> 02:42:31,240
- Now it's your turn, Rocco.
- No.

1725
02:42:32,993 --> 02:42:36,120
- No way.
- Come on!

1726
02:42:36,204 --> 02:42:39,415
All right, everybody outside, let's go.

1727
02:42:42,419 --> 02:42:45,504
Thank you, thank you!

1728
02:42:49,342 --> 02:42:51,635
This glass I raise...

1729
02:42:51,720 --> 02:42:54,013
and drink to your health...

1730
02:42:57,350 --> 02:43:02,062
hoping you're all happy
to share in our wealth.

1731
02:43:09,112 --> 02:43:11,906
Quiet, just a moment.

1732
02:43:12,991 --> 02:43:15,951
I thought somebody rang
the doorbell.

1733
02:43:16,036 --> 02:43:19,622
- Go take a look, I'm certain.
- No, Ma.

1734
02:43:24,503 --> 02:43:26,212
There's nobody there.

1735
02:43:26,296 --> 02:43:27,797
- No one?
- No.

1736
02:43:29,466 --> 02:43:31,091
No one.

1737
02:43:31,176 --> 02:43:36,013
Rocco, finish your toast.
Let's see if you're better at it than me.

1738
02:43:44,981 --> 02:43:49,068
No one's better, Ciro.
I'm not better than you.

1739
02:43:49,152 --> 02:43:52,488
What I'd like to toast...

1740
02:43:57,744 --> 02:44:01,580
is the day, still far off,

1741
02:44:03,542 --> 02:44:06,544
when I'll be able to go home.

1742
02:44:07,712 --> 02:44:09,797
If it's impossible for me,

1743
02:44:11,174 --> 02:44:15,761
then I hope that one of us
will one day return to our land.

1744
02:44:19,683 --> 02:44:21,725
Maybe you, Luca.

1745
02:44:22,227 --> 02:44:24,395
I'd go with you.

1746
02:44:24,521 --> 02:44:26,522
Remember, Luca,

1747
02:44:27,941 --> 02:44:31,235
ours is the land of the olive tree,

1748
02:44:32,988 --> 02:44:37,199
the moon and rainbows.

1749
02:44:43,373 --> 02:44:45,708
Do you remember, Vincenzo?

1750
02:44:45,834 --> 02:44:50,129
Before building a house,
the head mason throws a brick...

1751
02:44:52,883 --> 02:44:56,844
at the shadow of the first person
who happens by.

1752
02:44:56,970 --> 02:44:58,596
Why?

1753
02:45:02,934 --> 02:45:05,269
As a token of sacrifice

1754
02:45:06,104 --> 02:45:09,773
to ensure that the house
is strong and solid.

1755
02:45:30,629 --> 02:45:33,130
This time someone did ring.

1756
02:45:34,257 --> 02:45:37,593
No, wait... I'll go.

1757
02:46:16,299 --> 02:46:19,593
I knew it.
In my heart I knew it would be you.

1758
02:46:19,678 --> 02:46:24,473
I'm happy now. Come on!
Your brothers are all here.

1759
02:46:25,392 --> 02:46:27,142
Come on!

1760
02:46:36,653 --> 02:46:39,029
Have you eaten anything? No?

1761
02:46:39,114 --> 02:46:41,907
I'll heat something for you.

1762
02:46:41,992 --> 02:46:44,618
Tell me what you want.

1763
02:46:56,339 --> 02:46:58,924
- What now?
- Ciro, no!

1764
02:46:59,009 --> 02:47:02,845
I must ask you to leave,
I'm so sorry.

1765
02:47:02,929 --> 02:47:05,222
What's wrong, Simone?

1766
02:47:05,306 --> 02:47:08,600
What's wrong, my son?
I was so happy.

1767
02:47:08,685 --> 02:47:11,937
Tell her to shut up. Tell her!

1768
02:47:15,608 --> 02:47:19,445
- Come, we have to talk.
- I know...

1769
02:47:20,655 --> 02:47:23,866
but in front of everybody!

1770
02:47:23,950 --> 02:47:26,869
Talk to me, only to me.

1771
02:47:30,582 --> 02:47:32,458
To me, only to me.

1772
02:47:34,419 --> 02:47:36,545
Talk to me, for the love of God!

1773
02:47:36,629 --> 02:47:41,258
I'm not here because you won.
I don't give a damn about that!

1774
02:47:41,342 --> 02:47:44,344
I need money, I need it now.

1775
02:47:44,429 --> 02:47:47,473
- We made a pact!
- Get out!

1776
02:47:53,104 --> 02:47:59,401
Come to me for whatever you need,
understand?

1777
02:47:59,486 --> 02:48:01,570
Only to me.

1778
02:48:04,949 --> 02:48:07,868
You're hurt. What is this?

1779
02:48:09,162 --> 02:48:11,705
- It's blood.
- Blood?

1780
02:48:11,790 --> 02:48:13,749
Yes, blood...

1781
02:48:14,709 --> 02:48:16,835
She kept hanging on to me.

1782
02:48:16,920 --> 02:48:21,298
I couldn't get her off me.
She didn't want to die!

1783
02:48:21,382 --> 02:48:23,425
No! Simone!

1784
02:48:27,722 --> 02:48:30,891
- I killed her.
- No!

1785
02:48:38,274 --> 02:48:43,070
Don't worry, no one saw me.

1786
02:48:46,783 --> 02:48:49,451
- It's all over.
- No!

1787
02:48:51,287 --> 02:48:53,455
Are you happy now, Champ?

1788
02:48:54,332 --> 02:48:56,416
Isn't that what you wanted?

1789
02:49:01,422 --> 02:49:05,467
It's my fault, I know. All my fault!

1790
02:49:11,724 --> 02:49:13,892
Is that blood?
It's blood!

1791
02:49:13,977 --> 02:49:16,270
- No, Mama...
- What happened?

1792
02:49:16,354 --> 02:49:18,897
- Mama, don't go there.
- Mama, please.

1793
02:49:18,982 --> 02:49:21,650
Where is all this blood?

1794
02:49:21,734 --> 02:49:25,112
- Let me go!
- Mama...

1795
02:49:25,196 --> 02:49:28,824
- ...don't go there, please.
- Mama, don't.

1796
02:49:32,412 --> 02:49:35,998
Simone, my son!

1797
02:49:50,388 --> 02:49:54,516
I left her there, down by the water.

1798
02:49:56,978 --> 02:50:00,814
It's all over, Rocco, all over.

1799
02:50:14,621 --> 02:50:16,079
Ma...

1800
02:50:25,798 --> 02:50:30,010
Jealousy, that's the reason.

1801
02:50:30,094 --> 02:50:32,721
- Jealousy blinded him!
- Turn yourself in!

1802
02:50:32,805 --> 02:50:36,141
- He's your brother!
- Unfortunately!

1803
02:50:36,226 --> 02:50:39,770
I don't believe in the justice of men.

1804
02:50:39,854 --> 02:50:45,275
It's not for us to judge him,
but to help him, to save him.

1805
02:50:45,360 --> 02:50:47,778
I'll take care of everything.

1806
02:50:47,862 --> 02:50:50,322
That's not helping him!

1807
02:50:50,406 --> 02:50:55,369
- Rocco, what happened?
- Where are you going? What is it?

1808
02:50:55,453 --> 02:50:57,579
- I know what I'm doing.
- It's futile.

1809
02:50:59,415 --> 02:51:02,125
He's rid himself of that curse!

1810
02:51:02,210 --> 02:51:04,169
Have you gone crazy too?

1811
02:51:04,254 --> 02:51:09,716
Shame on you,
turning on your own Mother!

1812
02:51:09,801 --> 02:51:14,179
Christ will regret the suffering
he visited upon us!

1813
02:51:14,264 --> 02:51:16,515
Mama, don't curse!

1814
02:51:18,518 --> 02:51:20,644
It serves no purpose.

1815
02:51:20,728 --> 02:51:24,982
We're no longer in God's grace,
we're our own enemies.

1816
02:51:25,066 --> 02:51:27,526
We've all become enemies.

1817
02:51:28,569 --> 02:51:34,408
Why curse? We're all to blame.
We must pay for our faults.

1818
02:51:34,492 --> 02:51:36,868
- Ciro's gone!
- Ciro!

1819
02:51:38,830 --> 02:51:40,455
Wait, Ciro!

1820
02:51:57,140 --> 02:51:58,598
Stop!

1821
02:52:00,476 --> 02:52:02,853
For Papa's sake, don't do it!

1822
02:52:27,420 --> 02:52:29,588
There's no hope now.

1823
02:52:58,785 --> 02:53:01,370
Well? Tell me, what is it?

1824
02:53:02,246 --> 02:53:05,832
They took him away
this morning.

1825
02:53:05,917 --> 02:53:08,668
They found him on the roof

1826
02:53:08,753 --> 02:53:11,421
hiding behind the water tanks.

1827
02:53:13,174 --> 02:53:15,801
He spent three nights there.

1828
02:53:16,761 --> 02:53:20,764
Satisfied now? You're the one
who wanted to turn him in.

1829
02:53:23,059 --> 02:53:25,811
You're the boss of the house now.

1830
02:53:26,729 --> 02:53:30,357
When you're older, you'll realise
how unfair you've been,

1831
02:53:31,234 --> 02:53:33,485
how unfair you've all been to me.

1832
02:53:33,569 --> 02:53:37,030
No one loved Simone more than I did.

1833
02:53:41,202 --> 02:53:43,787
I was a kid when we left home

1834
02:53:43,871 --> 02:53:47,916
and it was Simone, not Vincenzo,
who made me understand

1835
02:53:48,000 --> 02:53:53,588
that in our home town
we were beasts of burden,

1836
02:53:53,673 --> 02:53:56,967
forced to work with blind obedience.

1837
02:53:59,804 --> 02:54:03,056
"We are not slaves," he said,

1838
02:54:03,975 --> 02:54:07,227
"but we must not neglect
our responsibilities."

1839
02:54:07,311 --> 02:54:09,396
But Simone forgot all that.

1840
02:54:10,189 --> 02:54:13,859
And, in doing so,
he ended up the way he did,

1841
02:54:13,985 --> 02:54:18,155
ruining himself,
and bringing shame on us all.

1842
02:54:19,824 --> 02:54:25,454
He hurt Rocco, and you too, Luca,
our youngest brother.

1843
02:54:25,538 --> 02:54:27,914
Simone once had good roots.

1844
02:54:29,250 --> 02:54:31,626
But he let weeds overtake him.

1845
02:54:31,711 --> 02:54:35,255
Even Rocco's goodness
and generosity are misplaced.

1846
02:54:38,342 --> 02:54:42,971
Rocco's a saint,
but what can he do in this world?

1847
02:54:43,055 --> 02:54:45,974
He won't defend himself.

1848
02:54:46,476 --> 02:54:48,560
He's so forgiving.

1849
02:54:49,520 --> 02:54:52,481
But one mustn't always forgive.

1850
02:55:00,823 --> 02:55:04,701
If Rocco goes back home,
I want to go with him.

1851
02:55:08,581 --> 02:55:11,708
I doubt he'll see
our home town again.

1852
02:55:11,792 --> 02:55:13,960
You might, some day.

1853
02:55:14,045 --> 02:55:17,172
But what do you think
you'll find there?

1854
02:55:17,256 --> 02:55:19,758
Things will change there too.

1855
02:55:20,593 --> 02:55:24,429
Even there, they realise
that things must change.

1856
02:55:25,431 --> 02:55:28,558
Many have little faith
in a changed world,

1857
02:55:29,310 --> 02:55:31,228
but I do.

1858
02:55:32,980 --> 02:55:37,317
You, Luca, will lead a more
upright and honest life.

1859
02:55:39,987 --> 02:55:43,406
The siren. I have to go back.

1860
02:55:48,704 --> 02:55:51,498
Give Mama a kiss for me.

1861
02:56:39,046 --> 02:56:40,505
Ciro!

1862
02:56:49,599 --> 02:56:51,308
- How are you?
- Fine.

1863
02:56:51,392 --> 02:56:53,768
- Why did you come?
- Ciao...

1864
02:56:53,853 --> 02:56:56,021
Ciao, how are you?

1865
02:56:56,105 --> 02:56:58,815
- It's late.
- I'll be right there!

1866
02:56:58,899 --> 02:57:01,526
I came to tell you I love you.

1867
02:57:01,611 --> 02:57:04,529
And I love you too... forever!

1868
02:57:09,535 --> 02:57:11,244
Ciro!

1869
02:57:13,372 --> 02:57:17,125
- What is it?
- Come home tonight!

1870
02:57:18,377 --> 02:57:20,962
We'll be waiting. Ciao.
