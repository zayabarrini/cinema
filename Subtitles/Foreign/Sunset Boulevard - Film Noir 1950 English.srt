[ SIREN WAILING ]

3
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,629
[ GILLIS ] Yes, this is Sunset Boulevard,
Los Angeles, California.

4
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,089
It's about 5:00 in the morning.

5
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,009
That's the homicide squad,

6
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:42,769
complete with detectives
and newspapermen.

7
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:45,939
A murder has been reported from
one of those great big houses

8
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,269
in the 10,000 block.

9
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:51,439
You'll read about it
in the late editions, I'm sure.

10
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,359
You'll get it over your radio
and see it on television.

11
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:59,619
Because an old-time star is involved.
One of the biggest.

12
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,159
But before you hear it all distorted
and blown out of proportion,

13
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,709
before those Hollywood columnists
get their hands on it,

14
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:12,209
maybe you'd like to hear the facts.
The whole truth.

15
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,379
If so, you've come to the right party.

16
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:21,799
You see, the body of a young man was
found floating in the pool of her mansion

17
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:25,309
with two shots in his back
and one in his stomach.

18
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:27,229
Nobody important, really.

19
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:31,149
Just a movie writer
with a couple of B pictures to his credit.

20
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:36,399
The poor dope.
He always wanted a pool.

21
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:39,239
Well, in the end, he got himself a pool,

22
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:42,369
only the price
turned out to be a little high.

23
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:49,999
Let's go back about six months
and find the day when it all started.

24
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,299
I was living in an apartment house
above Franklin and Ivar.

25
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,799
Things were tough at the moment.

26
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,969
I hadn't worked in a studio
for a long time.

27
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:04,969
So I sat there, grinding out
original stories, two a week.

28
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:09,309
Only I seemed to have lost my touch.

29
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:12,309
Maybe they weren't original enough.

30
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,149
Maybe they were too original.

31
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:17,819
All I know is, they didn't sell.

32
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,109
[ BUZZER SOUNDING ]

33
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:21,859
Yeah?

34
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:34,129
- Joseph C. Gillis?
- That's right.

35
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:37,299
We've come for the car.

36
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,629
What car?

37
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:43,549
1946 Plymouth convertible,
California license 40R-116.

38
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,889
Where are the keys?

39
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:47,599
Why should I give you the keys?

40
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,979
Because the company's
played ball with you long enough,

41
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:53,229
because you're three payments behind
and because we got a court order.

42
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:54,689
Now, come on. The keys.

43
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:57,399
Or do you want us to jack it up
and haul it away?

44
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,399
- Relax, fans. The car isn't here.
- [ MAN 1 ] Oh, is that so?

45
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:04,819
I loaned it to a friend of mine.
He took it down to Palm Springs.

46
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:07,079
Had to get away for his health,
I suppose.

47
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,079
If you don't believe me,
look in the garage.

48
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,829
Sure, sure, we believe you.
Only now we want you to believe us.

49
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,999
That car better be back here by noon
tomorrow or there's gonna be fireworks.

50
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,169
You say the cutest things.

51
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,769
[ GILLIS ] Well, I needed about $290,

52
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:37,609
and I needed it real quick,
or I'd lose my car.

53
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:41,859
It wasn't in Palm Springs,
and it wasn't in the garage.

54
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,109
I was way ahead
of the finance company.

55
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:48,529
I knew they'd be coming around,
and I wasn't taking any chances.

56
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,039
So I kept it across the street

57
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:54,209
in a parking lot
behind Rudy's Shoeshine Parlor.

58
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:55,669
Rudy never asked any questions

59
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,629
- about your finances.
- [ HONKING ]

60
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:00,839
He'd just look at your heels
and know the score.

61
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:08,719
I had an original story
kicking around Paramount.

62
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,519
My agent told me
it was dead as a doornail.

63
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,729
But I knew a big shot over there
who'd always liked me.

64
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:17,809
And the time had come to take
a little advantage of it.

65
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,519
His name was Sheldrake.

66
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:23,239
He was a smart producer,
with a set of ulcers to prove it.

67
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:29,329
All right, Gillis, you've got five minutes.
What's your story about?

68
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:32,159
It's about a baseball player,
a rookie shortstop that's batting .347.

69
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,250
Uh-huh.

70
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:34,890
Poor kid was
once mixed up in a hold-up.

71
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,640
- But he's trying to go straight.
- Uh-huh.

72
00:05:36,719 --> 00:05:38,919
Except there are a bunch of gamblers
that won't let him.

73
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:42,169
So they tell the poor kid he's got to
throw the World Series or else, huh?

74
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:43,359
More or less, except for the end.

75
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,820
I've got a gimmick that's real good.

76
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:45,969
Uh-huh. You got a title?

77
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:48,219

Call Readers' Department. Find out
what they have on Bases Loaded.

79
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,360
They're pretty hot about it
over at Twentieth,

80
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,939
except I think Zanuck's all wet.

81
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:59,519
- Can you see Ty Power as a shortstop?
- Mmm.

82
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:02,279
You've got the best man for it
right here on this lot. Alan Ladd.

83
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,989
Be a good change of pace for Ladd.

84
00:06:04,069 --> 00:06:06,229
And there's another thing.
It's pretty simple to shoot.

85
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:07,909
Lots of outdoor stuff.

86
00:06:07,989 --> 00:06:10,229
I bet you could make the whole thing
for under a million.

[ BURPS ] Excuse me.

88

And there's a great little part
for Bill Demarest,

89
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,099
one of the trainers, an old-time player

90
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,789
who got beaned,
goes out of his head sometimes.

91
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,110
- Hello, Mr. Sheldrake.
- Hello.

92
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:22,209
On that Bases Loaded,
I covered it with a two-page synopsis.

93
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,709
- Thank you.
- But I wouldn't bother.

94
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,629
- What's wrong with it?
- It's from hunger.

95
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,759
Nothing for Ladd?

96
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,520
It's just a rehash of something
that wasn't very good to begin with.

97
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:34,559
I'm sure you'll be glad to meet Mr. Gillis.
He wrote it.

98
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,479
This is Miss Kramer.

99
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:40,399
The name is Schaefer. Betty Schaefer.

100
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:44,819
Right now I wish I could crawl
in a hole and pull it in after me.

101
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,739
And if I could be of any help...

102
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:50,199
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Gillis, but I
just didn't think it was any good.

103
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,869
I found it flat and trite.

104
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,949
Exactly what kind of material
do you recommend?

105
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,869
James Joyce? Dostoyevsky?

106
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,459
I just think that pictures
should say a little something.

107
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:02,669
Oh, one of the message kids.
Just a story won't do.

108
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,390
You'd have turned down
Gone with the Wind.

109
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:08,419
No, that was me. I said,
"Who wants to see a Civil War picture?"

110
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:13,139
Perhaps the reason I hated
Bases Loaded is that I knew your name.

111
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,860
I'd always heard
that you had some talent.

112
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:17,221
That was last year.
This year I'm trying to earn a living.

113
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,729
So you take plot 27-A,
make it glossy, make it slick...

114
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:21,939
Uh-uh, uh-uh.
Those are dirty words.

115
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,979
You sound like
a bunch of New York critics.

116
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:28,279
- That'll be all, Miss Kramer... Schaefer.
- Goodbye, Mr. Gillis.

117
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:31,609
Next time I'll write you
The Naked and the Dead.

118
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:36,869
Well, it seems like Zanuck
has got himself a baseball picture.

119
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:38,550
Mr. Sheldrake, I don't want you to think

120
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,619
I thought this was going to win
any Academy Award.

121
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,709
Of course, we're always
looking for a Betty Hutton.

122
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:46,959
- Do you see it as a Betty Hutton?
- Frankly, no.

123
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:51,839
Now wait a minute. If we made it a girls'
softball team, put in a few numbers.

124
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:56,639
Might make a cute musical. It Happened
in the Bullpen: Story of a Woman.

125
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:00,689
Are you trying to be funny?
Because I'm all out of laughs.

126
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:03,729
- I'm over a barrel. I need a job.
- I haven't got a thing.

127
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:06,359
Any kind of an assignment.
Additional dialogue.

128
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,439
There's nothing. Honest.

129
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:13,489
Look, Mr. Sheldrake.

130
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:16,739
Could you let me have 300 bucks
yourself, as a personal loan?

131
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,829
Could I? Gillis.

132
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:24,249
Last year somebody talked me
into buying a ranch in the Valley.

133
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:27,089
So I borrowed the money from
the bank to pay for the ranch.

134
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:30,339
This year I had to mortgage the ranch
so I could keep up my life insurance,

135
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:32,219
so I could borrow on my insurance...

136
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,849
[ GILLIS ] After that
I drove down to headquarters.

137
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:42,019
That's the way a lot of us
think about Schwab's drug store.

138
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:46,109
Kind of a combination office,
kaffeeklatsch and waiting room.

139
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:49,819
Waiting. Waiting for the gravy train.

140
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:56,949
I got myself 10 nickels and started
sending out a general SOS.

141
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:59,989
Couldn't get hold of my agent, naturally.

142
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,499
So then I called a pal of mine,
Artie Green,

143
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:06,499
an awful nice guy, an assistant director.

144
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:09,549
He could let me have 20.
But 20 wouldn't do.

145
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:14,339
Then I talked to
a couple of yes-men at Metro.

146
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:16,759
To me they said no.

147
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:21,639
Finally I located that agent of mine.
The big faker.

148
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,479
Was he out digging up a job
for poor Joe Gillis?

149
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,559
No. He was hard at work in Bel-Air,
making with the golf sticks.

150
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:36,699
So you need $300.
Of course I could give you $300.

- No?

152

Gillis, get this through your head.
I'm not just your agent. It's not the 10%.

- I'm your friend.
- You are?

Once a talent like yours gets into that
Mocambo-Romanoff rut, you're through.

157
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:55,469
Forget Romanoffs.
It's the car I'm talking about!

158
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:57,550
If I lose my car,
it's like having my legs cut off.

159
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:59,190
Greatest thing that could happen to you.

160

Now you'll have to sit behind
the typewriter. Now you'll have to write.

I need $300.

162

Sweetheart, maybe what you need
is another agent.

[ GILLIS ] As I drove back towards town,
I took inventory of my prospects.

164
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,459
They now added up to exactly zero.

165
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:32,419
Apparently I just didn't have
what it takes.

166
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:36,629
And the time had come to wrap up the
whole Hollywood deal and go home.

167
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,129
Maybe if I hooked all my junk

168
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,299
there 'd be enough
for a bus ticket back to Ohio.

169
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:44,469
Back to that $35-a-week job
behind the copy desk

170
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,479
at the Dayton Evening Post,
if it was still open.

171
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,649
Back to the smirking delight
of the whole office.

172
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:55,649
"All right, you wise guys. Why don't you
go out and take a crack at Hollywood?"

173
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:58,399
"Maybe you think
that you could make..."

[ TIRE BURSTING ]

176
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:59,919
I had landed myself
in the driveway of some big mansion

177
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:02,889
that looked run-down and deserted.

178
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:05,849
At the end of the drive
was a lovely sight indeed,

179
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:11,139
a great big empty garage,
just standing there, going to waste.

180
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:16,109
If ever there was a place to stash away
a limping car with a hot license number.

181
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,119
There was another occupant
in that garage,

182
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,409
an enormous, foreign-built auto-mobile.

183
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,919
It must have burned up
ten gallons to a mile.

184
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,089
It had a 1932 license.

185
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:42,009
I figured that's when the owners
had moved out.

186
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:44,719
And I also figured I couldn't
go back to my apartment

187
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,509
now that those bloodhounds
were onto me.

188
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,809
The idea was to get to Artie Green's
and stay there

189
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:52,769
until I could make that bus for Ohio.

190
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:56,439
Once back in Dayton, I'd drop the
credit boys a picture postcard,

191
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:59,359
telling them where to pick up the jalopy.

192
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:05,609
It was a great big white elephant
of a place.

193
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:09,449
The kind crazy movie people
built in the crazy '20s.

194
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:13,159
A neglected house
gets an unhappy look.

195
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,829
This one had it in spades.

196
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,419
It was like that old woman
in Great Expectations,

197
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:23,919
that Miss Havisham in her rotting
wedding dress and her torn veil,

198
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:27,889
taking it out on the world
because she'd been given the go-by.

[ NORMA ] You there!
Why are you so late?

In here.

203

I just put my car in the garage.
I had a blow-out. I thought maybe...

- [ NORMA ] Have him come up, Max.

Suppose you listen to me

I put him on my massage table
in front of the fire.

They're dead. They're finished.

There was a time in this business

when they had the eyes

But that wasn't good enough for them.
Oh, no!

242
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:58,179
They had to have the ears
of the world, too.

So they opened their big mouths
and out came talk, talk, talk.

That's where
the popcorn business comes in.

300
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:21,429
This promised to go the limit.

301
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:23,389
I wondered what a handwriting expert

302
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:26,299
would make of that
childish scrawl of hers.

303
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:32,389
Max wheeled in some champagne
and some caviare.

304
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:37,939
Later I found out that Max was the only
other person in that grim Sunset castle.

305
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:41,489
And I found out
a few other things about him.

306
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:45,569
As for her, she sat
coiled up like a watch spring,

307
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:48,579
her cigarette clamped
in a curious holder.

308
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:51,909
I could sense her eyes on me
from behind those dark glasses,

309
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,959
defying me not to like what I read.

310
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:59,249
Or maybe begging me
in her own proud way to like it.

311
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,339
It meant so much to her.

312
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:13,729
It sure was a cosy setup,
that bundle of raw nerves and Max

00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:15,979
- and a dead monkey upstairs.

[ DOORBELL RINGS ]

316
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:33,079
Later on, just for comedy relief,
the real guy arrived with the baby coffin.

317
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:38,499
It was all done with great dignity.

318
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:41,799
He must have been
a very important chimp.

319
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,669
The great-grandson
of King Kong, maybe.

320
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,639
It got to be 11:00.

321
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,179
I was feeling a little sick at my stomach,

322
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:57,479
what with that sweet champagne
and that tripe I'd been reading,

323
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:02,029
that silly hodgepodge
of melodramatic plots.

324
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:07,409
However, by then, I'd started
concocting a little plot of my own.

325
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,329
Well?

326
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:14,249
- This is fascinating.
- Of course it is.

327
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:19,279
Maybe it's a little long and maybe
there's some repetitions,

328
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,999
but you're not a professional writer.

329
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:27,339
- I wrote that with my heart.
- Sure you did.

330
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:29,589
That's what makes it great.

331
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:35,139
What it needs is
maybe a little more dialog.

332
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:37,889
What for?
I can say anything I want with my eyes.

333
00:22:37,979 --> 00:22:40,499
Well, it certainly could use
a pair of shears and a blue pencil.

334
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,859
I will not have it butchered.

335
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:46,819
Of course not,
but it ought to be organized.

Just an editing job.
You can find somebody.

I'd have to have somebody I could trust.

I'm busy. I just finished a script,
and I'm due on another assignment.

I don't care.

You know, I'm pretty expensive.
I get 500 a week.

00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:27,239
I wouldn't worry about money.
I'll make it worth your while.

348
00:23:27,319 --> 00:23:29,759
Maybe I'd better take the rest
of the script home and read it.

349
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:33,159
Oh, no! I couldn't let it out of my house.
You'll have to finish it here.

00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,409
Well, it's getting kind of late.

- Are you married, Mr...
- Name is Gillis. Single.

352
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:43,419
- Where do you live?
- Hollywood. Alto Nido Apartments.

353
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,459
There's something wrong
with your car, you said.

00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:47,669
There sure is.

355
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,429
- Why shouldn't you stay here?
- Look, I'll come back early tomorrow.

356
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:55,099
Nonsense.
There's a room over the garage.

Max will take you there. Max!

358
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:06,819
[ GILLIS ] I felt kind of pleased
with the way I'd handled the situation.

359
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:10,239
I dropped the hook
and she snapped at it.

360
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:15,489
Now my car would be safe down below
while I did a patch-up job on the script.

361
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:18,409
And there should be
plenty of money in it.

362
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:26,459
This room hasn't
been used for a long time.

363
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:30,049
It'll never make House Beautiful,
but I guess it's okay for one night.

364
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:32,049
I made your bed this afternoon.

365
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:36,549
Thanks. How did you know I was
gonna stay this afternoon?

366
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:41,019
The bathroom's over there. I put in
some towels, soap and a toothbrush.

Say, she's quite a character,
that Norma Desmond.

She was the greatest of them all.
You wouldn't know. You're too young.

00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:57,199
In one week she received
17,000 fan letters.

Men bribed her hairdresser
to get a lock of her hair.

371
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:03,369
There was a maharajah
who came all the way from India

372
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:07,749
to beg one of her silk stockings.
Later he strangled himself with it.

00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:13,299
Well, I sure turned in
to an interesting driveway.

as slightly cuckoo, too.

00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:29,019
A stroke, maybe.

377
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:32,569
Come to think of it, the whole
place seemed to have been stricken

378
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:38,239
with a kind of creeping paralysis,
out of beat with the rest of the world,

00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,579
crumbling apart in slow motion.

There was a tennis court,
or rather the ghost of a tennis court,

with faded markings and a sagging net.

And, of course, she had a pool.
Who didn't then?

Mabel Normand and John Gilbert must
have swum in it 10,000 midnights ago.

The last rites for that hairy old chimp,
performed with the utmost seriousness.

As if she were
laying to rest an only child.

Was her life really as empty as that?

In it, there was an organ grinder.

395

I couldn't see his face,
but the organ was all draped in black,

and a chimp was dancing for pennies.

When I opened my eyes,
the music was still there.

Oh, yes.
In that empty room over her garage.

Only it wasn't empty any more.
I'd had a visitor.

Somebody had brought in

Why, what's the matter?
Is there anything missing?

You'll like it here.

Thanks for the invitation.
I've got my own apartment.

Okay, we'll deduct it from my salary.

Now, now, don't let's be small about
such matters. We won't keep books.

- Max, unpack Mr. Gillis' things.
- It is done, Madame.

421
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:03,909
Well, pack them up again!
I didn't say I was staying!

00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:08,029
Suppose you make up your mind.
Do you want this job or don't you?

423
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:13,079
[ GILLIS ] Yes, I wanted the job.

424
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:16,789
I wanted the dough, and I wanted
to get out of there as quickly as I could.

425
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:21,509
I thought If I really got going,
I could finish it up in a couple of weeks.

426
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:23,879
But it wasn't so simple
getting some coherence

427
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:26,969
into those wild hallucinations of hers.

428
00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:30,809
And what made it even tougher was
that she was around all the time,

429
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:35,939
hovering over me, afraid I'd do injury
to that precious brainchild of hers.

430
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:46,569
- What's that?
- Just a scene I threw out.

00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,029
Which scene?

432
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,720
The one where you go
to the slave market.

433
00:29:49,799 --> 00:29:51,759
It's better to cut directly
to John the Baptist...

434
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:53,869
Cut away from me?

435
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:56,959
Honestly, it's a little too much of you.
They don't want you in every scene.

436
00:29:56,980 --> 00:30:00,039
They don't? Then why do they still
write me fan letters every day?

437
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:01,629
Why do they beg me
for my photographs?

438
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:06,879
Why? Because they want to see me.
Me! Norma Desmond.

439
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:09,719
- Put it back.
- Okay.

440
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:26,609
[ GILLIS ] I didn't argue with her.

441
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:31,239
You don't yell at a sleepwalker.
He may fall and break his neck.

442
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:32,659
That's it.

443
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:36,659
She was still sleepwalking along
the giddy heights of a lost career.

444
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:41,669
Plain crazy when it came to that
one subject, her celluloid self,

445
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:44,209
the great Norma Desmond.

446
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:47,969
How could she breathe in that house
so crowded with Norma Desmonds,

00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:50,929
more Norma Desmonds

The plain fact was she was afraid
of that world outside.

Afraid it would remind her
that time had passed.

They were silent movies, and Max
would run the projection machine,

00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:29,849
This is for you and me.

- Oh?
- Hold me tighter.

600
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:34,479
Okay.

601
00:43:36,070 --> 00:43:38,779
Come midnight, how about
blindfolding the orchestra

602
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:41,619
and smashing champagne glasses
over Max's head?

603
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:44,739
- You think this is all very funny.
- A little.

604

[ GILLIS ] An hour dragged by.

605
00:43:56,050 --> 00:44:00,219
I felt caught, like the cigarette
in that contraption on her finger.

606
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:10,479
What a wonderful next year it's
going to be. What fun we'll have!

607
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,059
I'll fill the pool for you.

608
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:15,519
I'll open my house in Malibu,
and you can have the whole ocean.

609
00:44:15,610 --> 00:44:18,489
And when our picture is finished,
I'll buy you a boat

610
00:44:18,570 --> 00:44:20,569
and we'll sail to Hawaii...

611
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:22,610
Stop it. You're not going
to buy me anything more.

612
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:24,619
Don't be silly.

613
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:27,829
Here.
I was going to give it to you at midnight.

614
00:44:30,410 --> 00:44:32,709
Norma, I can't take it.
You've bought me enough.

615

Shut up. I'm rich.

616
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:37,629
I'm richer than all this
new Hollywood trash.

- [ CHUCKLES ] I've got $1,000,000.
- Keep it.

618
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:44,549
I own three blocks down town.
I've got oil in Bakersfield.

Pumping, pumping, pumping.

00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:50,229
What's it for
but to buy us anything we want?

621
00:44:50,310 --> 00:44:53,149
Cut out that "us" business!

622
00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:54,649
What's the matter with you?

623
00:44:54,730 --> 00:44:57,359
What right do you have
to take me for granted?

624
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:01,149
What right? Do you want me to tell you?

625
00:45:03,529 --> 00:45:05,929
Has it ever occurred to you
that I may have a life of my own?

626
00:45:05,950 --> 00:45:09,699
That there may be some girl
that I'm crazy about?

627
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:13,459
Who? Some carhop or dress extra?

628
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:16,209
What I'm trying to say is
that I'm all wrong for you.

629
00:45:16,290 --> 00:45:20,209
You want a Valentino, somebody
with polo ponies. A big shot.

630
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:23,759
What you're trying to say is
you don't want me to love you.

631
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:26,139
Say it. Say it!

632
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:46,969
[ GILLIS ] I didn't know where I was going.
I just had to get out of there.

633
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:52,099
I had to be with people my own age.
I had to hear somebody laugh again.

634
00:46:55,060 --> 00:46:57,139
I thought of Artie Green.

635
00:46:57,230 --> 00:46:59,309
There was bound to be
a New Year's shindig going on

in his apartment down on Las Palmas.

637
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:05,739
Writers without a job,
composers without a publisher,

00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:10,199
actresses so young they still believe
the guys in the casting offices.

639
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:15,249
A bunch of kids who didn't give a hoot
just so long as they had a yuk to share.

640
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:22,749
Hollywood for us ain't been so good
Got no swimming pool, very few clothes.

641
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:26,759
All we earn are buttons and bows.

- Well, what do you know! Joe Gillis!
- Hiya, Artie.

646

Where you been keeping
that gorgeous face of yours?

647
00:47:41,670 --> 00:47:42,559
In a deep freeze.

- Let it ride for a while.

- You're gonna stay, aren't you?
- Well, that was the general idea.

00:47:57,660 --> 00:48:01,159
Then, come on. What is this, mink?

Who did you borrow that from?
Adolphe Menjou?

Close, but no cigar.

- It's a good party.
- The greatest.

- I didn't say you could have my girl.
- Oh, this is shop talk.

00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:00,920
Now, if I got you correctly,
there was a short stretch of my fiction

which you found worthy of notice.

694
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:04,140
The flashback scene in the courtroom

00:50:04,230 --> 00:50:05,939
when she tells about
being a schoolteacher.

696

I had a teacher like that once.

697
00:50:07,710 --> 00:50:10,999
Maybe that's why it's good.
It's true. It's moving.

- Now why don't you use that character...
- Who wants true? Who wants moving?

Maybe there's some paper around.

- As for instance?
- Well...

705

We could make some paper boats
and have a regatta.

Or we could turn on the shower

was that to do?

at your disposal. Artie's out of town.

1047
01:13:57,680 --> 01:14:00,809
- What's Artie got to do with it?
- We're engaged.

1048
01:14:01,270 --> 01:14:04,979
Oh. Oh, well, good for you.
You couldn't find a nicer guy.

1049
01:14:05,060 --> 01:14:09,319
That's what I think. They're on location
in Arizona, making a Western.

1050
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:11,439
I'm free every evening
and every weekend.

1051
01:14:11,529 --> 01:14:13,129
We could work at your place,
if you want.

1052
01:14:13,150 --> 01:14:14,779
[ CAR HONKING ]

1053
01:14:14,860 --> 01:14:17,069
Look, Betty, it can't be done. It's out!

1054
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:19,279
Now, stop being chicken-hearted
and write that story!

1055
01:14:19,370 --> 01:14:22,409
- Honest to goodness, I hate you!
- And don't make it too dreary.

1056
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:23,789
How about this for a situation?

1057
01:14:23,870 --> 01:14:25,919
She teaches daytimes,
he teaches at night. Right?

1058
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,680
- Right.
- They don't even know each other,

1059
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:29,929
but they share the same room.
It's cheaper that way.

1060
01:14:30,020 --> 01:14:33,969
As a matter of fact, they sleep
in the same bed. In shifts, of course.

1061
01:14:35,050 --> 01:14:37,889
Are you kidding?
Because I think it's good.

1062
01:14:38,300 --> 01:14:39,639
- So do I.
- Well, come on back.

1063
01:14:39,720 --> 01:14:42,309
- Let me show you where it fits in.
- So long.

1064
01:14:42,390 --> 01:14:44,229
Oh, you...

1065
01:14:50,359 --> 01:14:52,519
- What's the matter, Max?
- I just found out the reason

1066
01:14:52,540 --> 01:14:55,129
for all those telephone calls
from Paramount.

1067
01:14:55,570 --> 01:14:59,489
It's not Madame they want.
It's her car they want to rent.

1068
01:14:59,700 --> 01:15:00,949
What?

1069
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:07,499
Well, goodbye, Norma.
We'll see what we can do.

1070
01:15:07,580 --> 01:15:11,209
I'm not worried. Everything will be fine.
The old team together again.

1071
01:15:11,290 --> 01:15:14,839
- Nothing can stop us.
- The old team. Yeah.

1072
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:19,679
- Goodbye, dear.
- Goodbye, Mr. DeMille.

1073
01:15:28,520 --> 01:15:30,359
- How'd it go?
- It couldn't have gone better.

1074
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:32,019
It's practically set.

1075
01:15:32,110 --> 01:15:36,859
Of course, he has to finish this picture
first, but mine will be his next.

1076
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:41,909
Get Gordon Cole.
Tell him to forget about her car.

1077
01:15:41,990 --> 01:15:44,909
Tell him he can get
another old car some place.

1078
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,829
I'll buy him five old cars, if necessary.

1079
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:56,209
[ GILLIS ] After that,

1080
01:15:56,300 --> 01:16:00,389
an army of beauty experts invaded
her house on Sunset Boulevard.

1081
01:16:01,300 --> 01:16:04,469
She went through
a merciless series of treatments.

1082
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:08,559
Like an athlete training for the Olympic
Games, she counted every calorie.

1083
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:11,019
Went to bed every night at 9:00.

1084
01:16:11,100 --> 01:16:14,269
She was absolutely determined
to be ready,

1085
01:16:14,650 --> 01:16:17,649
ready for those cameras
that would never turn.

1086
01:16:54,440 --> 01:16:56,939
- Joe, darling, are you there?
- Yes, Norma.

1087
01:16:57,030 --> 01:17:00,149
Don't turn around!
Keep your eyes on the book.

1088
01:17:02,530 --> 01:17:04,739
I just came to say good night.

1089
01:17:05,619 --> 01:17:06,699
I don't want you to see me.

1090
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:09,659
- I'm not very attractive.
- Good night.

1091
01:17:09,750 --> 01:17:11,749
You know, I've lost half a pound
since Tuesday.

1092
01:17:11,830 --> 01:17:13,329
- Good!
- I was a little worried

1093
01:17:13,420 --> 01:17:14,959
about the line of my throat.

1094
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:17,549
- This woman has done wonders with it.
- Good.

1095
01:17:19,380 --> 01:17:23,219
- You'd better get to bed yourself.
- I think I'll read a little longer.

1096
01:17:25,050 --> 01:17:28,009
You went out last night, didn't you, Joe?

1097
01:17:28,100 --> 01:17:30,639
- Why do you say that?
- I just happen to know it.

1098
01:17:30,730 --> 01:17:32,330
I had a nightmare
and I screamed for you.

1099
01:17:32,390 --> 01:17:35,309
You weren't here. Where were you?

1100
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:38,689
- I went for a walk.
- No, you didn't. You took the car.

1101
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:42,819
All right, I drove to the beach.

1102
01:17:42,900 --> 01:17:45,500
Norma, you don't want me to feel
that I'm locked up in this house?

1103
01:17:45,570 --> 01:17:49,659
Of course not, Joe. It's just that
I don't want to be left alone.

1104
01:17:49,740 --> 01:17:54,119
Not while I'm under this terrible strain.
My nerves are being torn to shreds.

1105
01:17:54,210 --> 01:17:58,589
All I ask is for you to be a little patient
and a little kind.

1106
01:18:00,380 --> 01:18:02,060
[ SIGHING ] Norma,
I haven't done anything.

1107
01:18:02,130 --> 01:18:04,009
Of course you haven't.

1108
01:18:04,970 --> 01:18:08,509
I wouldn't let you. Good night, darling.

1109
01:18:37,790 --> 01:18:41,629
[ GILLIS ] Yes, I was playing hooky
every evening alone in there.

1110
01:18:43,130 --> 01:18:44,839
It made me think of when I was 12

1111
01:18:44,930 --> 01:18:48,719
and used to sneak out on the folks
to see a gangster picture.

1112
01:18:49,140 --> 01:18:53,769
This time, it wasn't to see a picture.
It was to try and write one.

1113
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:56,559
That story of mine
Betty Schaefer had dug up

1114
01:18:56,650 --> 01:19:00,319
kept going through my head
like a dozen locomotives.

1115
01:19:01,070 --> 01:19:03,989
So, we started working on it,
the two of us,

1116
01:19:04,110 --> 01:19:09,029
nights when the studio was deserted,
up in her little cubbyhole of an office.

1117
01:19:25,670 --> 01:19:28,049
I got the funniest letter from Artie.

1118
01:19:28,130 --> 01:19:31,099
It's rained every day since
they got to Arizona.

1119
01:19:31,180 --> 01:19:34,889
They rewrote the whole picture for rain
and shot half of it.

1120
01:19:35,730 --> 01:19:38,939
Now, the sun is out.
Nobody knows when they'll get back.

1121
01:19:39,020 --> 01:19:40,609
- Good.
- What's good about it?

1122
01:19:40,690 --> 01:19:43,109
I miss him something fierce.

1123
01:19:43,190 --> 01:19:44,939
I mean this is good dialogue
along in here.

1124
01:19:45,030 --> 01:19:46,739
- It'll play.
- It will?

1125
01:19:46,820 --> 01:19:50,779
Sure. Especially with lots of music
underneath, drowning it out.

1126
01:19:51,240 --> 01:19:54,289
- Don't you sometimes hate yourself?
- Constantly.

1127
01:19:55,790 --> 01:20:00,129
No, in all seriousness, this is really
good. It's fun writing with you.

1128
01:20:01,330 --> 01:20:03,039
Oh, thanks.

1129
01:20:16,730 --> 01:20:18,229
BETTY: Who's Norma?

1130
01:20:20,060 --> 01:20:21,559
Who's who?

1131
01:20:21,650 --> 01:20:24,939
Oh, I'm sorry. I don't usually read
private cigarette cases.

1132
01:20:25,030 --> 01:20:27,899
Oh, that. It's from a friend of mine,

1133
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:32,989
a middle-aged lady,
very foolish and very generous.

1134
01:20:33,070 --> 01:20:35,329
I'll say. This is solid gold.

1135
01:20:35,410 --> 01:20:37,909
I gave her some advice
on an idiotic script.

1136
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,079
Oh, the old, familiar story.

1137
01:20:40,170 --> 01:20:42,749
You help a timid little soul
cross a crowded street.

1138
01:20:42,830 --> 01:20:47,089
She turns out to be a multi-millionaire
and leaves you all her money.

1139
01:20:47,510 --> 01:20:50,879
That's the trouble with you readers.
You know all the plots.

1140
01:20:50,970 --> 01:20:54,219
Now, suppose you proofread
page 10 while the water boils.

1141
01:20:54,300 --> 01:20:56,259
Okay? Okay.

1142
01:21:19,950 --> 01:21:23,039
[ GILLIS ] Sometimes, when we got stuck,

1143
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:25,959
we'd make a little tour
of the drowsing lot,

1144
01:21:26,290 --> 01:21:28,249
not talking much,

1145
01:21:28,340 --> 01:21:31,969
just wandering down alleys
between the sound stages

1146
01:21:32,050 --> 01:21:35,969
or through the sets they were getting
ready for the next day's shooting.

1147
01:21:36,350 --> 01:21:38,099
As a matter of fact,

1148
01:21:38,180 --> 01:21:41,889
it was on one of those walks
when she first told me about her nose.

1149
01:21:41,980 --> 01:21:43,769
Look at this street.

1150
01:21:43,850 --> 01:21:48,229
All cardboard, all hollow, all phony,
all clone with mirrors.

1151
01:21:48,650 --> 01:21:52,199
You know, I like it better
than any street in the world.

1152
01:21:52,820 --> 01:21:56,069
Maybe because I used to play here
when I was a kid.

1153
01:21:56,990 --> 01:21:59,329
What were you, a child actress?

1154
01:21:59,740 --> 01:22:04,209
No, I was born just two blocks from this
studio. Right on Lemon Grove Avenue.

1155
01:22:04,290 --> 01:22:06,709
My father was head electrician here
till he died.

1156
01:22:06,790 --> 01:22:09,799
- Mother still works in Wardrobe.
- Second generation, huh?

1157
01:22:09,880 --> 01:22:12,589
Third. Grandma did stunt work
for Pearl White.

1158
01:22:12,670 --> 01:22:14,299
I come from a picture family.

1159
01:22:14,630 --> 01:22:17,139
Naturally, they expected me
to become a great star.

1160
01:22:17,220 --> 01:22:21,429
So I had 10 years of dramatic lessons,
diction, dancing.

1161
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:25,399
Then the studio made a test.
Well, they didn't like my nose.

1162
01:22:25,690 --> 01:22:29,269
It slanted this way a little.
So, I went to a doctor and had it fixed.

1163
01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:32,029
They made more tests
and they were crazy about my nose,

1164
01:22:32,110 --> 01:22:34,949
only they didn't like my acting.

1165
01:22:37,620 --> 01:22:39,029
- Nice job.
- It should be.

1166
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:41,449
It cost me $300.

1167
01:22:41,870 --> 01:22:44,289
- That's the saddest thing I ever heard.
- Oh, not at all.

1168
01:22:44,370 --> 01:22:46,749
It taught me a little sense.
I got a job in the mail room,

1169
01:22:46,830 --> 01:22:49,039
worked up to the Stenographic.
Now I'm a reader.

1170
01:22:49,130 --> 01:22:50,130
Come clean, Betty.

1171
01:22:50,210 --> 01:22:53,379
At night you weep for those lost
close-ups, those gala openings.

1172
01:22:53,460 --> 01:22:54,509
Not once.

1173
01:22:54,590 --> 01:22:57,469
What's wrong with being on the
other side of the cameras?

1174
01:22:57,550 --> 01:23:01,349
- It's really more fun.
- Three cheers for Betty Schaefer!

1175
01:23:01,720 --> 01:23:05,019
- I will now kiss that nose of yours.
- If you please.

1176
01:23:09,650 --> 01:23:13,939
- May I say that you smell real special?
- It must be my new shampoo.

1177
01:23:15,650 --> 01:23:20,909
That's no shampoo. It's more like
freshly laundered linen handkerchiefs.

1178
01:23:21,910 --> 01:23:25,039
Like a brand-new auto-mobile.

1179
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:27,789
- How old are you, anyway?
- Twenty-two.

1180
01:23:29,080 --> 01:23:32,589
Smart girl.
Nothing like being twenty-two.

1181
01:23:34,460 --> 01:23:37,129
And may I suggest that
if we're ever to finish this story,

1182
01:23:37,220 --> 01:23:40,009
you stay at least two feet away from me.

1183
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:42,520
The first time you see me
coming any closer,

1184
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:46,519
I want you to take off a shoe
and clunk me on the head with it.

1185
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:51,359
Now back to the typewriters,
by way of Washington Square.

1186
01:24:37,820 --> 01:24:40,239
What is it, Max?

1187
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:42,699
Want to wash the car,

1188
01:24:42,780 --> 01:24:45,909
or are you doing a little spying
in your off hours?

1189
01:24:45,990 --> 01:24:49,329
You must be very careful
as you cross the patio.

1190
01:24:49,410 --> 01:24:50,919
Madame may be watching.

1191
01:24:50,999 --> 01:24:53,559
How about going up the kitchen stairs
