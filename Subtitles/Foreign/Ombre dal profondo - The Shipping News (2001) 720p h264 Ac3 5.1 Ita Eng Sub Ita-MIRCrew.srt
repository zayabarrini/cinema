1
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,775
Ain't got all day.

2
00:01:32,027 --> 00:01:33,106
Dad, I can't!

3
00:01:33,362 --> 00:01:34,737
Ain't got all day, boy.

4
00:01:42,246 --> 00:01:43,575
Go on, boy.

5
00:01:43,831 --> 00:01:44,531
Help!

6
00:01:44,999 --> 00:01:46,197
You can do it.

7
00:01:50,297 --> 00:01:53,381
Let me see you move your arms.
Kick your legs!

8
00:02:01,017 --> 00:02:02,345
Come on!

9
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,060
You're not trying!

10
00:02:07,482 --> 00:02:10,020
Nobody's gonna make it easy for you!

11
00:02:13,322 --> 00:02:17,948
I used to imagine that I'd been given
to the wrong family at birth...

12
00:02:19,745 --> 00:02:24,039
and that, somewhere in the world,
my real people longed for me.

13
00:02:26,377 --> 00:02:28,335
From where my father stood...

14
00:02:28,588 --> 00:02:32,669
my failure to dog-paddle was only
the first of many failures.

15
00:02:33,302 --> 00:02:37,086
Failure to speak clearly.
Failure to sit up straight.

16
00:02:37,765 --> 00:02:42,392
Failure to make friends every time we
moved to another dreary upstate town.

17
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:48,310
In me, my father recognized a failed life:

18
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:50,147
His own.

19
00:02:51,613 --> 00:02:53,606
When I got admitted to the junior college,

20
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:55,817
my father figured it was a clerical error.

21
00:02:56,952 --> 00:02:59,788
When I dropped out a year later,
he wasn't surprised.

22
00:03:01,499 --> 00:03:02,614
Quoyle!

23
00:03:04,419 --> 00:03:06,542
Job not stimulating enough for you?

24
00:03:10,634 --> 00:03:12,876
This is the best work I've ever had.

25
00:03:47,257 --> 00:03:51,884
I stumbled into adulthood learning to
separate my feelings from my life.

26
00:03:54,014 --> 00:03:55,473
Counting on nothing.

27
00:03:58,144 --> 00:04:00,183
I got used to being invisible.

28
00:04:02,565 --> 00:04:05,602
Until someone noticed me.

29
00:04:32,765 --> 00:04:33,796
Let's go.

30
00:04:35,184 --> 00:04:37,011
Wake up! Go!

31
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:47,359
What's your name?

32
00:04:48,073 --> 00:04:49,069
Quoyle.

33
00:04:49,908 --> 00:04:51,189
Are you alright?

34
00:04:51,452 --> 00:04:53,279
I'm starving, Quoyle, aren't you?

35
00:04:57,708 --> 00:04:59,119
I sell burglar alarms.

36
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:01,369
Really?

37
00:05:02,547 --> 00:05:04,670
That must be interesting work.

38
00:05:05,383 --> 00:05:09,761
I'm an ink setter.
I work for "The Poughkeepsie News".

39
00:05:17,104 --> 00:05:18,599
You haven't touched your food.

40
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,020
Oh.

41
00:05:32,663 --> 00:05:34,074
So, what do you think?

42
00:05:37,543 --> 00:05:39,916
You want to marry me, don't you?

43
00:05:44,384 --> 00:05:45,926
It's 8:05.

44
00:05:47,971 --> 00:05:51,969
I think I'm gonna fuck you by 10:00.
What do you think of that?

45
00:06:21,341 --> 00:06:25,920
Oh my god...
that was the biggest one yet.

46
00:06:36,357 --> 00:06:38,682
I'm always hungry after I get laid.

47
00:06:38,943 --> 00:06:42,028
I guess 'cause I burn up so many calories.

48
00:06:46,201 --> 00:06:48,028
You live in a dump, Quoyle.

49
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:49,949
I love you.

50
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:11,053
Nibble, nibble, little mouse...

51
00:07:24,576 --> 00:07:26,035
What'd the doctor say?

52
00:07:26,286 --> 00:07:29,240
If I end up with stretch marks, I'll sue his ass.

53
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:33,035
Petal, is everything okay?

54
00:07:36,339 --> 00:07:38,664
Petal, you're the only woman I've ever loved.

55
00:07:41,636 --> 00:07:43,925
How do you make an Alabama Slammer?

56
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:46,640
Where are you, sweetheart?

57
00:07:46,892 --> 00:07:48,351
Alabama.
That's the point.

58
00:07:48,644 --> 00:07:51,431
Look up the recipe. It's on the fridge,
where I keep the Mr. Boston.

59
00:07:51,731 --> 00:07:54,436
If you come home, I'll make one for you.

60
00:07:54,775 --> 00:07:56,733
Oh Christ, never mind.

61
00:07:57,403 --> 00:07:58,601
I'll have a Vodka.

62
00:08:04,036 --> 00:08:06,787
It's okay, Bunny.

63
00:09:11,692 --> 00:09:13,187
Is your friend gone?

64
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:15,147
My "friend"?

65
00:09:18,241 --> 00:09:19,570
Oh, shit.

66
00:09:23,622 --> 00:09:26,327
Don't do that.
Don't touch me!

67
00:09:34,634 --> 00:09:38,679
Stop doing stuff!
Creepin' around, cleaning up.

68
00:09:42,726 --> 00:09:45,846
Look, it's no good.

69
00:09:48,691 --> 00:09:50,565
Find yourself a girlfriend.

70
00:09:50,985 --> 00:09:53,191
I don't want a girlfriend. I want you.

71
00:09:54,864 --> 00:09:56,145
Your funeral.

72
00:09:58,285 --> 00:10:00,740
- Are you gonna be home for dinner?
- Don't expect me.

73
00:10:00,996 --> 00:10:02,704
- Bunny's missed you.
- Hey, Petal.

74
00:10:02,956 --> 00:10:04,914
Hey, Bunny Rabbit. Petal's gotta run.

75
00:10:05,334 --> 00:10:06,912
That's so pretty.

76
00:10:09,714 --> 00:10:11,837
Here.
So's that.

77
00:10:18,682 --> 00:10:20,390
Oh, shit!

78
00:10:30,361 --> 00:10:32,520
- Sorry.
- That's okay.

79
00:10:48,422 --> 00:10:51,092
Hi, this message is for Daniel Smith...

80
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:54,302
confirming your appointment
with Dr. Davis today at noon.

81
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,717
Quoyle, this is your father.

82
00:11:00,394 --> 00:11:02,221
Lost your home number.

83
00:11:03,564 --> 00:11:06,518
It's time for your mother
and I to put an end to it.

84
00:11:07,735 --> 00:11:11,484
I left instructions with
the undertaker, Dayton & Sons.

85
00:11:11,739 --> 00:11:14,776
Told 'em to notify my sister, Agnis Hamm.

86
00:11:16,703 --> 00:11:20,915
Not much of a life.
Nobody gave me nothin'.

87
00:11:21,917 --> 00:11:26,211
Other men would of given up and
turned into bums, but I didn't.

88
00:11:27,256 --> 00:11:30,127
I went without so
you could have advantages...

89
00:11:31,427 --> 00:11:34,001
not that you done anything with them...

90
00:11:37,976 --> 00:11:39,933
What, were they sick or something?

91
00:11:42,189 --> 00:11:45,523
Come on, they must've left something.
What's their house worth?

92
00:11:45,776 --> 00:11:48,481
No, the bank is taking it.
There's nothing left.

93
00:11:48,738 --> 00:11:52,403
There were medical bills, and
funeral costs. It's all gone, honey.

94
00:11:52,784 --> 00:11:54,860
You wanna marry me, don't you?

95
00:11:58,707 --> 00:12:00,581
I won't have to go to school?

96
00:12:00,834 --> 00:12:04,250
It's an adventure. Who goes to school
when they're on an adventure?

97
00:12:04,505 --> 00:12:05,703
Is Daddy coming?

98
00:12:05,965 --> 00:12:07,673
No.
Daddy's boring.

99
00:12:08,926 --> 00:12:10,124
Daddy's boring?

100
00:12:10,595 --> 00:12:12,634
That's right.
You're a very clever girl.

101
00:12:14,391 --> 00:12:17,226
There's Frank.
Come on, he's waitin'

102
00:12:17,894 --> 00:12:19,353
Hey, big guy.

103
00:12:20,355 --> 00:12:21,518
Bye.

104
00:12:25,236 --> 00:12:28,605
Hey...
what about my pay?

105
00:12:34,204 --> 00:12:37,538
My pay...
You owe me for three weeks.

106
00:12:47,343 --> 00:12:50,297
She didn't leave me
a message or a note somewhere?

107
00:12:50,555 --> 00:12:51,753
Only for you to pay me.

108
00:12:52,015 --> 00:12:54,850
What?
Her name's Bunny.

109
00:12:58,772 --> 00:13:00,599
She's six years old...

110
00:13:15,624 --> 00:13:18,744
Agnis Hamm.
Half-sister of Guy Quoyle.

111
00:13:19,711 --> 00:13:20,910
I'm your aunt.

112
00:13:21,171 --> 00:13:22,452
This is a bad time.

113
00:13:23,299 --> 00:13:26,715
So I heard. I'm here to visit his ashes.

114
00:13:26,969 --> 00:13:29,674
No, I mean this is a really bad time.

115
00:13:31,474 --> 00:13:32,969
She's never done anything like this.

116
00:13:33,226 --> 00:13:34,886
I mean, she's walked out before...

117
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:36,930
but never with Bunny.
I don't understand.

118
00:13:37,522 --> 00:13:39,930
The potato chips won't help you.
Drink your tea.

119
00:13:40,734 --> 00:13:43,023
Tea's a good drink. It'll keep you going.

120
00:13:49,202 --> 00:13:51,527
Could you maybe stick around for a while?

121
00:13:51,788 --> 00:13:54,326
Sorry, just passing through.

122
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:02,422
On my way to Newfoundland,
where our people come from.

123
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,581
You ever been there, Nephew?

124
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:11,803
I just wanted to say farewell to Guy
first. If you'll tell me where he is.

125
00:14:13,937 --> 00:14:18,398
Oh. Sorry. He's the one on the left.

126
00:14:27,869 --> 00:14:29,577
Petal, hello... is that you?

127
00:14:29,829 --> 00:14:32,451
- Mr. Quoyle?
- Yes, it is.

128
00:14:32,707 --> 00:14:35,662
This is Investigator Danzig
from the New York State Police.

129
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:37,330
Oh Jesus...
have you found 'em?

130
00:14:37,588 --> 00:14:38,453
Yes, sir.

131
00:14:42,718 --> 00:14:44,960
- Hello?
- Yes, sir, I'm still here.

132
00:14:48,558 --> 00:14:49,886
How's Bunny?

133
00:14:50,185 --> 00:14:52,308
I think she's gonna be all right.

134
00:14:52,604 --> 00:14:55,060
Thank God. And Petal?

135
00:14:55,816 --> 00:14:58,058
We'll talk about that when we get there.

136
00:14:58,777 --> 00:15:00,604
You're gonna bring her here?

137
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:01,479
Yes, sir.

138
00:15:01,739 --> 00:15:03,696
- You have the address?
- Yes, we do.

139
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:13,745
They're bringing Petal...
they're bringing Bunny. They found 'em.

140
00:15:14,044 --> 00:15:16,369
The cop's got somethin' to tell me about Petal.

141
00:15:17,089 --> 00:15:20,173
I hope she didn't get in any trouble...
she's got such a temper.

142
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:26,717
The convertible went over
a guardrail in Jersey.

143
00:15:27,308 --> 00:15:30,179
Fortunately, your daughter
was no longer traveling

144
00:15:30,395 --> 00:15:32,933
with Mrs. Quoyle and, uh...
and her male companion.

145
00:15:34,232 --> 00:15:37,732
She was mercifully killed on impact,
I can promise you.

146
00:15:39,446 --> 00:15:41,854
Look... there is something else.

147
00:15:43,576 --> 00:15:47,621
Seems she sold your daughter
to a black market adoption outfit...

148
00:15:47,872 --> 00:15:49,580
for $6,000.

149
00:15:50,709 --> 00:15:53,282
There was even a receipt, if you can imagine.

150
00:15:54,129 --> 00:15:56,003
That's how we tracked her.

151
00:15:56,256 --> 00:15:57,454
Daddy!

152
00:16:01,971 --> 00:16:03,430
Hi, sweetheart.

153
00:16:04,891 --> 00:16:06,136
Who's that?

154
00:16:06,517 --> 00:16:08,391
"That" is your Great Aunt Agnis.

155
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:10,646
Where's Petal?

156
00:16:12,107 --> 00:16:13,387
Mommy?

157
00:16:24,454 --> 00:16:26,945
Maybe I could stay just a day or two.

158
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:33,835
"Your loved one has not left
your heart or your thoughts...

159
00:16:35,507 --> 00:16:37,833
but is sleeping peacefully."

160
00:16:38,302 --> 00:16:40,176
She's sleeping?

161
00:16:42,139 --> 00:16:44,547
Yes. Peacefully.

162
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:48,644
In heaven. With the angels.

163
00:16:53,026 --> 00:16:56,396
If I was asleep, I'd wake up.

164
00:17:03,287 --> 00:17:05,494
Why are you so scared?

165
00:17:30,776 --> 00:17:32,603
What do I do?

166
00:17:56,428 --> 00:17:58,505
It takes a year, Nephew...

167
00:17:59,473 --> 00:18:01,134
a full turn of the calendar,

168
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:04,055
to get over losing someone.
That's a true sayin'

169
00:18:06,856 --> 00:18:08,683
The move'll help. You'll see.

170
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:15,817
What place on earth could be better
than the place your people came from?

171
00:18:17,493 --> 00:18:19,865
Smell that clean northern sea?

172
00:18:21,372 --> 00:18:23,199
I'm not a water person.

173
00:18:25,585 --> 00:18:27,210
At least the girl is.

174
00:18:29,548 --> 00:18:31,624
I hope we're doing the right thing, Aunt.

175
00:18:32,676 --> 00:18:34,799
I thought I'd never come back here.

176
00:18:35,095 --> 00:18:39,508
But the older you get, there's an ache, a pull...

177
00:18:40,309 --> 00:18:42,349
somethin' you've gotta figure out.

178
00:18:42,604 --> 00:18:44,561
Like you're a piece in a puzzle.

179
00:18:59,622 --> 00:19:02,327
It takes some time to get used
to the rockin' out here.

180
00:19:02,542 --> 00:19:04,250
It's a place like no other.

181
00:19:05,086 --> 00:19:08,420
The people who came here came by accident.

182
00:19:09,007 --> 00:19:12,341
Those that stayed learned
strange things can happen.

183
00:19:12,678 --> 00:19:17,589
Omens and restless spirits...
Magic...

184
00:19:18,935 --> 00:19:22,185
We Quoyles, we left it 50 years ago.

185
00:19:23,273 --> 00:19:24,981
Hard times.

186
00:19:30,823 --> 00:19:35,651
We're nearly there.
Quoyle Point. Named after us. You.

187
00:19:37,288 --> 00:19:40,206
I don't understand.
It's May, there's so much snow.

188
00:19:41,668 --> 00:19:44,373
Up here, forget everything you thought
you knew about the weather.

189
00:20:12,576 --> 00:20:14,403
I was born in that house.

190
00:20:26,174 --> 00:20:30,635
Empty 44 years, look at that roofline.
Straight as a ruler.

191
00:21:12,391 --> 00:21:13,221
Look.

192
00:21:17,063 --> 00:21:18,343
I wonder who that is.

193
00:21:18,606 --> 00:21:22,818
It's your grandfather, Sian Quoyle.
Died before I was born.

194
00:21:24,154 --> 00:21:26,111
Died young... 12 years old.

195
00:21:28,116 --> 00:21:30,904
Twelve? Then he couldn't
have been my grandfather.

196
00:21:31,161 --> 00:21:32,988
You don't know Newfoundlanders.

197
00:21:33,706 --> 00:21:35,200
Who's this?

198
00:21:37,835 --> 00:21:39,579
It's my father and...

199
00:21:41,965 --> 00:21:43,044
And you?

200
00:21:46,094 --> 00:21:48,253
I never did care for that hat.

201
00:21:54,729 --> 00:21:58,513
Oh my lord, the blessed table!

202
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:06,734
We can't live here.

203
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:10,159
It's all fixable. We'll get a carpenter.

204
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:14,954
It might be cheaper if we just build
a whole new house on the Riviera.

205
00:22:16,085 --> 00:22:18,623
Only I wasn't born on the Riviera.

206
00:23:10,227 --> 00:23:11,307
Daddy?

207
00:23:12,104 --> 00:23:12,851
What...?

208
00:23:16,651 --> 00:23:18,110
Why'd you wake me up?

209
00:23:18,945 --> 00:23:21,697
I wanted to see if you were asleep.

210
00:24:20,762 --> 00:24:23,598
Are these cables
so the house won't blow away?

211
00:24:23,932 --> 00:24:25,427
So far so good.

212
00:24:26,143 --> 00:24:29,014
They say it rocked in storms
like a big rocking chair.

213
00:24:29,271 --> 00:24:31,810
Made the women sick, so they lashed it down.

214
00:24:32,066 --> 00:24:33,264
They're moaning.

215
00:24:33,901 --> 00:24:35,645
The house is sad.

216
00:24:37,155 --> 00:24:37,937
What?

217
00:24:41,034 --> 00:24:42,778
You should let it loose.

218
00:25:05,019 --> 00:25:06,429
I'm here to apply for a job.

219
00:25:06,687 --> 00:25:08,146
Come on in.

220
00:25:23,163 --> 00:25:27,457
Name's Tert Card; managing editor,
rewrite man, and snow shoveller.

221
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:29,667
You'll have to do without the boss.

222
00:25:29,921 --> 00:25:33,586
Himself, Jack Buggit,
has called in sick, as per usual.

223
00:25:33,841 --> 00:25:37,792
Which is why I am occupying his office,
Billy Pretty, and no bones about it!

224
00:25:38,054 --> 00:25:38,671
Come in.

225
00:25:40,307 --> 00:25:41,256
Name?

226
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:44,556
Quoyle. I just got here yesterday...

227
00:25:45,354 --> 00:25:49,222
A Quoyle, are you?
I should of seen that right off.

228
00:25:49,734 --> 00:25:50,647
Sit down.

229
00:25:52,904 --> 00:25:57,650
Prior experience as a journalist.
Washington Post? London Times?

230
00:25:58,535 --> 00:26:01,157
No, I'm not a journalist. I'm an ink setter.

231
00:26:04,083 --> 00:26:05,162
Gammy Bird.

232
00:26:05,417 --> 00:26:07,126
Are you in my office, Tert?

233
00:26:07,503 --> 00:26:11,453
No, Jack. I'm just conducting
a job interview here at my desk.

234
00:26:11,716 --> 00:26:12,747
Job interview?

235
00:26:13,009 --> 00:26:15,844
There's a Mr. Quoyle here...
says he's an ink setter.

236
00:26:16,137 --> 00:26:18,095
The fella's a Quoyle, you say?

237
00:26:18,348 --> 00:26:19,724
And no mistake.

238
00:26:20,893 --> 00:26:23,847
Have him meet me at the dock in one hour.

239
00:26:24,104 --> 00:26:26,560
That bronchitis of yours cleared up already?

240
00:26:26,816 --> 00:26:30,101
Much better. Thanks for your concern.

241
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:38,951
Over here. Step lively.

242
00:26:44,501 --> 00:26:47,372
- Hello there, Mr. Buggit...
- The name's Jack.

243
00:26:47,672 --> 00:26:49,166
Come on, get in.

244
00:27:00,811 --> 00:27:02,436
I'm not a water person.

245
00:27:02,855 --> 00:27:06,306
All Quoyles is water people.
Boats is in your blood.

246
00:27:06,901 --> 00:27:11,480
That's why I'm hiring you. I need
somebody to cover the shipping news.

247
00:27:11,823 --> 00:27:14,065
The harbormaster'll get you a list...

248
00:27:14,284 --> 00:27:16,442
what ships come into,
and go out of Killick-Claw.

249
00:27:16,703 --> 00:27:18,577
But I'm an ink setter.

250
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:23,292
Pay attention... I don't need
no ink setter, I need a reporter.

251
00:27:24,628 --> 00:27:28,578
You'll be doing local car wrecks...
take the photos, write the story.

252
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:32,088
We run a front-page car-wreck
photo every week,

253
00:27:32,303 --> 00:27:34,177
whether or not we actually have one.

254
00:27:35,098 --> 00:27:38,598
There's a knack at taking photos
that make you feel something.

255
00:27:38,852 --> 00:27:42,684
If there's a dark patch
on the ground, it reads blood...

256
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:45,146
whether it's motor oil or Diet Coke.

257
00:27:45,401 --> 00:27:48,355
And you want something human
lyin' in the road...

258
00:27:48,613 --> 00:27:52,825
a child's mitten, a purse, a baseball cap.

259
00:27:53,076 --> 00:27:55,698
That's what makes the reader feel.

260
00:27:55,954 --> 00:27:57,413
I'm no reporter.

261
00:27:58,957 --> 00:28:03,620
You think any of them tomcods knew
how to write when I hired 'em?

262
00:28:04,839 --> 00:28:06,748
I get a feeling about people, that's all.

263
00:28:40,002 --> 00:28:41,793
Welcome home, Guy.

264
00:28:45,216 --> 00:28:49,677
I can't do it. Even if I knew the first
thing about writing, which I don't.

265
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,922
Car crashes?
I can't cover those.

266
00:28:53,183 --> 00:28:54,013
Why not?

267
00:28:55,602 --> 00:28:56,931
You know why not.

268
00:28:59,148 --> 00:29:02,433
We face up to the things we're afraid
of because we can't go around them.

269
00:29:04,195 --> 00:29:06,520
Car wrecks are a fact of life up here.

270
00:29:06,989 --> 00:29:10,655
Come winter, a drive into town'll be
damn near impossible.

271
00:29:11,369 --> 00:29:12,828
We'll buy us a boat.

272
00:29:13,163 --> 00:29:15,784
I already told you, I'm not a water person.

273
00:29:17,584 --> 00:29:19,043
They dragged it here.

274
00:29:20,796 --> 00:29:21,792
What, honey?

275
00:29:22,047 --> 00:29:24,883
The house. They dragged it here.

276
00:29:25,927 --> 00:29:27,125
You must've had a dream.

277
00:29:27,387 --> 00:29:28,715
Who told you about that?

278
00:29:34,978 --> 00:29:37,648
Long time ago, on Gaze Island.

279
00:29:38,816 --> 00:29:41,271
The old Quoyles couldn't make a go of it there.

280
00:29:42,069 --> 00:29:44,905
So they lashed the house
with ropes and dragged it.

281
00:29:48,493 --> 00:29:51,447
Across the ice, clear to the mainland.
Right here.

282
00:30:41,926 --> 00:30:45,342
This is from the "News
of Your Neighbors" column.

283
00:30:46,347 --> 00:30:49,135
"The pole on the corner
of Main and West Streets...

284
00:30:49,392 --> 00:30:53,058
has a sign on it saying it's illegal
to put anything on that pole.

285
00:30:54,314 --> 00:30:56,224
The postman has landed in the clink

286
00:30:56,442 --> 00:30:58,933
for throwing the mail in Killick-Claw Harbor.

287
00:30:59,403 --> 00:31:01,360
He said he had too much to deliver,

288
00:31:01,572 --> 00:31:04,028
and folks could take a dip
and help themselves.

289
00:31:04,492 --> 00:31:06,532
Guess it helps if you can swim!"

290
00:31:07,036 --> 00:31:09,991
This is professional stuff.
How am I supposed to write this?

291
00:31:10,248 --> 00:31:12,241
You can't.
You'll get it wrong.

292
00:31:12,501 --> 00:31:15,537
Don't you talk to your father
like that! Of course he can do it.

293
00:31:15,796 --> 00:31:18,334
Petal says Dad never gets anything right

294
00:31:18,841 --> 00:31:20,584
Yeah, well, it'll work out.

295
00:31:35,693 --> 00:31:38,398
Hello. You must be Quoyle.

296
00:31:38,904 --> 00:31:42,487
B. Beaufield Nutbeem.
I head up the Foreign News Department.

297
00:31:42,784 --> 00:31:46,532
He steals every story off
that goddamn shortwave.

298
00:31:46,788 --> 00:31:51,082
Which Tert takes the liberty of
rewriting in his own mystical tongue.

299
00:31:51,334 --> 00:31:54,336
Only to save you
from charges of plagiarism!

300
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:58,582
Mr. Billy Pretty, an old fish dog
and local landmark.

301
00:31:58,843 --> 00:32:02,888
Edits the Home News Page...
poems, baby photos, household tips.

302
00:32:03,181 --> 00:32:04,805
There's your desk.

303
00:32:11,398 --> 00:32:14,269
Is there a computer?

304
00:32:14,651 --> 00:32:16,110
D'ya see one?

305
00:32:16,612 --> 00:32:19,732
No. I see everyone else...

306
00:32:20,408 --> 00:32:22,068
Keen observational powers.

307
00:32:22,285 --> 00:32:24,527
I can see why Jack snatched
ya off the job market.

308
00:32:35,883 --> 00:32:38,006
Quoyle, you lead a charmed life.

309
00:32:38,219 --> 00:32:40,710
Two minutes on the job,
and you got your first car wreck.

310
00:32:43,558 --> 00:32:46,014
As far as I can tell,
the site is really fresh...

311
00:32:46,227 --> 00:32:47,971
10, 15 minutes at the most.

312
00:32:48,563 --> 00:32:51,054
You got two victims:
One male, one female.

313
00:32:51,316 --> 00:32:53,190
Not one vital sign between 'em.

314
00:32:55,613 --> 00:32:59,860
Rate of speed we estimate at 65,
so there's nothing unlawful here.

315
00:33:00,409 --> 00:33:03,992
Not a whole lot you can do when
a moose decides to get in your way.

316
00:33:06,666 --> 00:33:08,789
The driver's chest was probably crushed

317
00:33:09,002 --> 00:33:11,291
before the car hit the water,
so that's a mercy.

318
00:33:14,466 --> 00:33:16,792
And, out of season,
a moose that size is a gift really,

319
00:33:17,011 --> 00:33:18,291
when you think about it.

320
00:33:20,598 --> 00:33:22,970
Billy, I suppose we could split it four ways.

321
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:37,688
He's new, is he?

322
00:33:41,162 --> 00:33:44,496
It's wrecks like that that sells papers.

323
00:33:45,792 --> 00:33:47,251
Jack knows his readers.

324
00:33:47,502 --> 00:33:50,587
Mind you, there's more people
under these waters

325
00:33:50,797 --> 00:33:52,256
than are killed on the roads.

326
00:33:53,968 --> 00:33:57,004
You'll want to get yourself
a nice little boat before long.

327
00:33:57,930 --> 00:34:00,600
I don't want to think about a boat right now.

328
00:34:01,517 --> 00:34:02,680
Who's that?

329
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,262
Why?

330
00:34:07,023 --> 00:34:10,393
I've seen her around. She's very tall.

331
00:34:12,696 --> 00:34:14,404
She's got good posture.

332
00:34:22,874 --> 00:34:25,959
It was grief that caused
her boy to be not right.

333
00:34:26,586 --> 00:34:29,706
She was carrying him when
her husband was drowned at sea.

334
00:34:29,965 --> 00:34:32,290
Like I was saying,
there's more life lost that way.

335
00:34:41,895 --> 00:34:43,971
How's your car wreck comin'?

336
00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:52,903
If I wanted "War and Peace", I would
have hired William Shakespeare.

337
00:35:16,515 --> 00:35:19,220
The policeman ate breakfast
at the Codcake Diner

338
00:35:19,435 --> 00:35:21,558
before arriving at the accident scene?

339
00:35:31,031 --> 00:35:32,146
Yes?

340
00:35:33,576 --> 00:35:37,159
Your spelling is fine, and I've seen
plenty worse grammar.

341
00:35:37,622 --> 00:35:40,291
But finding the center,
the beatin' heart of your story...

342
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,042
that's what makes a reporter.

343
00:35:42,419 --> 00:35:47,461
Start by making up headlines.
Short, punchy. Dramatic.

344
00:35:50,177 --> 00:35:52,799
Out there, what do you see?
Tell me the headline.

345
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:58,269
"Horizon Fills With Dark Clouds."

346
00:35:58,519 --> 00:36:00,643
"Imminent Storm Threatens Village!"

347
00:36:03,859 --> 00:36:05,567
What if no storm comes?

348
00:36:06,862 --> 00:36:09,187
"Village Spared From Deadly Storm!"

349
00:36:21,336 --> 00:36:23,044
How was your first day?

350
00:36:23,296 --> 00:36:24,328
What's all this?

351
00:36:26,466 --> 00:36:30,464
We can't fix up the house proper on a
journalist's wages. So I've un-retired.

352
00:36:30,679 --> 00:36:31,711
From what?

353
00:36:31,972 --> 00:36:35,840
Boat upholstery. All us Quoyles
have a feeling for boats.

354
00:36:36,102 --> 00:36:37,265
Who's this?

355
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,190
Dennis Buggit, master carpenter.

356
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:44,901
Only till I get me lobster license.
I'm a fisherman in me soul.

357
00:36:45,612 --> 00:36:50,321
Buggit, huh? Any relation to
my boss down at the Gammy Bird?

358
00:36:52,078 --> 00:36:54,117
Yeah. My dad.

359
00:36:55,081 --> 00:36:57,654
Tomorrow I'll run 2x4's under your second story.

360
00:37:00,712 --> 00:37:02,752
So I wouldn't sleep upstairs tonight,

361
00:37:02,964 --> 00:37:05,538
'less you wanna wake up
downstairs with a thud.

362
00:37:42,674 --> 00:37:43,753
What is it?

363
00:37:44,009 --> 00:37:46,167
A ghost.
The window.

364
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:50,599
A skinny ghost. And a white dog.

365
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:53,769
I didn't dream it. Don't say I did.

366
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:55,099
I won't, sweetheart.

367
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:12,789
Excuse me...

368
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:15,914
- this is our first day at school...
- I don't like these kids.

369
00:38:16,586 --> 00:38:18,377
- She's in the after-school...
- They're boring!

370
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:20,296
Boring!

371
00:38:20,549 --> 00:38:21,924
That's enough.

372
00:38:23,093 --> 00:38:25,880
I'm sorry. She's not usually like this.

373
00:38:26,138 --> 00:38:27,418
Not usually like what?

374
00:38:27,973 --> 00:38:30,809
I hate going to new places
where I don't know anybody.

375
00:38:31,769 --> 00:38:34,058
I don't know anybody.

376
00:38:36,316 --> 00:38:37,644
What's wrong with him?

377
00:38:38,276 --> 00:38:40,435
Bunny, there is nothing wrong with him.

378
00:38:40,695 --> 00:38:45,156
This is Herry. When he was being born,
he didn't get enough air to breathe.

379
00:38:45,784 --> 00:38:50,078
That makes him a little slower
than most people. What's your name?

380
00:38:50,665 --> 00:38:51,447
Bunny.

381
00:38:51,999 --> 00:38:53,542
A bunny rabbit.

382
00:38:53,793 --> 00:38:55,371
That's what my mother calls me.

383
00:38:55,628 --> 00:38:57,123
Is Mommy at work now?

384
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:59,871
She's asleep with the angels.

385
00:39:02,219 --> 00:39:03,962
I am a Bunny Rabbit.

386
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:06,675
You certainly are.

387
00:39:13,314 --> 00:39:15,770
Which of those women are in charge here?

388
00:39:16,025 --> 00:39:18,398
Neither of them. They're just moms.

389
00:39:18,945 --> 00:39:21,781
Somebody oughta
pay more attention to them.

390
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:23,782
Look, there's scissors on the ground...

391
00:39:24,159 --> 00:39:27,611
Don't you think somebody
oughta be supervising them?

392
00:39:31,918 --> 00:39:35,417
Better get back to work.
Supervising and all.

393
00:39:35,672 --> 00:39:38,507
I'm Wavey Prowse, I run the place.

394
00:39:39,176 --> 00:39:40,634
They are having entirely too much fun,

395
00:39:40,844 --> 00:39:44,130
aren't they?
It's a constant problem here.

396
00:39:50,146 --> 00:39:51,308
Headline:

397
00:39:52,857 --> 00:39:56,689
"Bumbling Dad Humiliated at Daycare."

398
00:40:01,575 --> 00:40:01,860
C'mon over, Quoyle!

399
00:40:14,589 --> 00:40:16,416
You've been to the harbormaster's.

400
00:40:16,675 --> 00:40:18,003
Boats in, boats out.

401
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:19,968
Not exactly the stuff of legends.

402
00:40:20,887 --> 00:40:23,343
Sometimes there's a story behind the story.

403
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:24,630
What can I do you for?

404
00:40:25,309 --> 00:40:28,346
I'll have whatever they're having.

405
00:40:28,604 --> 00:40:30,846
- What are you having?
- Squid burger. It's good.

406
00:40:35,695 --> 00:40:37,439
Have you got yourself a boat yet?

407
00:40:37,697 --> 00:40:38,314
No.

408
00:40:38,573 --> 00:40:42,192
Y'oughta get Alvin Yark to build you one.
Or you could buy Nutbeem's.

409
00:40:44,788 --> 00:40:48,205
I built a Chinese junk.
Sailed it up from Brazil.

410
00:40:48,459 --> 00:40:50,416
I missed Manhattan by a mile or so,

411
00:40:50,628 --> 00:40:53,380
and got stranded here when
I shipwrecked by Gaze Island.

412
00:40:53,673 --> 00:40:57,173
I've almost finished my repairs.
I'll be sailing away soon.

413
00:40:58,428 --> 00:41:02,296
She's ugly.
And the only thing I've ever loved.

414
00:41:06,729 --> 00:41:08,722
Your story tugs at me bladder.

415
00:41:17,991 --> 00:41:18,905
Excuse me.

416
00:41:21,161 --> 00:41:22,988
What is it between those two?

417
00:41:25,541 --> 00:41:29,325
First thing: You have
to understand about the curse.

418
00:41:30,964 --> 00:41:33,252
Jack Buggit's father, his grandfather,

419
00:41:33,466 --> 00:41:35,792
his great-grandfather...
all died at sea.

420
00:41:36,761 --> 00:41:41,424
Second thing: Jack is sensitive.
Especially about the sea.

421
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:48,102
Sensitive. It's what they call people
around here who... know things.

422
00:41:50,193 --> 00:41:53,147
So Dennis is forbidden the sea.

423
00:41:53,655 --> 00:41:58,483
But being free, Newfie,
and 21, he goes anyway.

424
00:41:58,785 --> 00:42:01,277
- And that's enough...?
- Death storm.

425
00:42:01,497 --> 00:42:06,289
A massive wave cracks her hull
amidships, starboard to port.

426
00:42:06,877 --> 00:42:09,416
Men go in the water. Dennis is lost.

427
00:42:10,924 --> 00:42:12,122
After a week,

428
00:42:12,801 --> 00:42:17,380
they come to Jack and tell him
the search is to be called off.

429
00:42:18,348 --> 00:42:23,176
He stands like a stone.
Then he turns, quick, and says...

430
00:42:25,773 --> 00:42:27,398
"He's alive.

431
00:42:28,901 --> 00:42:30,978
And I know where."

432
00:42:33,156 --> 00:42:37,617
So he goes out to sea, alone, in just a skiff...

433
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:41,372
and finds Dennis.

434
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:47,708
Can you guess the odds? Finds him.
Both arms broken, 99% dead.

435
00:42:49,799 --> 00:42:51,377
The boy comes to.

436
00:42:51,593 --> 00:42:55,258
Jack says, "If you ever step foot in a boat again...

437
00:42:56,473 --> 00:42:58,466
I'll drown you myself."

438
00:42:59,184 --> 00:43:01,426
And do you know what Dennis said?

439
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:03,350
Say it fast.

440
00:43:03,939 --> 00:43:08,401
"All fishing licenses are spoken for,
I'd appreciate you giving me yours."

441
00:43:08,653 --> 00:43:10,776
Jack looked in his eyes.
They never spoke again.

442
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,067
Ya got the Shipping News written up yet?

443
00:43:20,124 --> 00:43:21,832
There's nothin' here.

444
00:43:24,086 --> 00:43:26,293
Boats in, boats out. What else is there?

445
00:43:27,382 --> 00:43:29,754
If I knew, I'd write it myself.

446
00:43:30,593 --> 00:43:35,006
I took a chance on ya, Quoyle...
don't let me down.

447
00:44:13,807 --> 00:44:16,891
Excuse me. Do I know you?

448
00:44:17,895 --> 00:44:22,522
I work for the local paper.
I do the Shipping News.

449
00:44:23,609 --> 00:44:25,068
Is this your boat?

450
00:44:25,945 --> 00:44:28,863
That's a boat. This is a Botterjacht.

451
00:44:30,575 --> 00:44:34,869
She was built for Hitler.
He was the original owner.

452
00:44:36,456 --> 00:44:39,411
I just wanted to ask you a couple of questions.

453
00:44:39,668 --> 00:44:41,994
The finest botterjacht ever built in Holland.

454
00:44:42,254 --> 00:44:44,128
Tell him what happened in Hurricane Bob.

455
00:44:44,382 --> 00:44:47,549
And she's incredibly heavy...
40 tons of solid oak.

456
00:44:47,802 --> 00:44:48,798
Tell him!

457
00:44:54,518 --> 00:44:59,346
She broke three of her moorings and
pounded six expensive boats to rubble.

458
00:45:02,568 --> 00:45:03,434
WHAMM!

459
00:45:07,699 --> 00:45:11,198
Now tell him who let our insurance lapse.

460
00:45:18,711 --> 00:45:23,172
It took six very expensive
lawyers to weasel us out of it.

461
00:45:24,509 --> 00:45:26,632
An inch from bankruptcy.

462
00:45:28,138 --> 00:45:30,711
Moral of story?
When you marry a tour guide,

463
00:45:30,932 --> 00:45:32,972
keep his authority to mixing the drinks.

464
00:45:36,939 --> 00:45:38,647
Did I come at a bad time?

465
00:45:39,567 --> 00:45:42,319
Yeah. Ten years ago would've been better.

466
00:45:47,033 --> 00:45:50,200
"Wife Fires Artillery On Hitler's Boat."

467
00:45:58,963 --> 00:46:00,077
- Hi.
- Hi.

468
00:46:00,339 --> 00:46:01,715
You guys need a ride?

469
00:46:02,258 --> 00:46:04,714
Thanks, but Herry likes to walk.

470
00:46:05,345 --> 00:46:07,337
Well, it's a nice day for a walk.

471
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:13,767
Mr. Quoyle, about the other day.
I'm sorry we got off on the wrong foot.

472
00:46:14,021 --> 00:46:17,888
No, I was way off base.

473
00:46:19,151 --> 00:46:23,019
I admire anybody that works with kids.
That's the hardest job in the world.

474
00:46:24,449 --> 00:46:26,488
I'm a journalist myself.

475
00:46:26,743 --> 00:46:29,614
Really?
Have you seen our local paper?

476
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:32,123
Strictly fish wrap.

477
00:46:36,837 --> 00:46:37,501
What?

478
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:42,375
I'm the new reporter there.

479
00:46:46,264 --> 00:46:49,514
No... I'm sure that'll be...

480
00:46:51,228 --> 00:46:52,687
Good luck to you.

481
00:46:52,938 --> 00:46:56,722
Thank you very much.
It was nice to see you again.

482
00:47:05,869 --> 00:47:06,983
Dennis?

483
00:47:26,307 --> 00:47:27,588
What are you doing?

484
00:47:27,851 --> 00:47:29,559
She's boring.

485
00:47:40,823 --> 00:47:43,361
How was Bunny when you
picked her up from daycare?

486
00:47:44,494 --> 00:47:46,451
Alright.
A little snotty.

487
00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:55,459
What's that?

488
00:47:58,718 --> 00:48:00,177
Robert Burns.

489
00:48:04,724 --> 00:48:06,468
Someone gave that to you?

490
00:48:10,689 --> 00:48:12,765
Someone that you're missing.

491
00:48:18,447 --> 00:48:22,232
Six years ago today.
Leukemia.

492
00:48:25,747 --> 00:48:27,372
We weren't married.

493
00:48:28,709 --> 00:48:30,951
But that's a technicality.

494
00:49:02,495 --> 00:49:03,824
Is that your boat?

495
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:05,195
Yeah, I just bought 'er.

496
00:49:06,333 --> 00:49:07,364
Why?

497
00:49:07,626 --> 00:49:09,832
- Well, she's a speed boat.
- It's a shit boat.

498
00:49:10,087 --> 00:49:12,756
A wallowing cockeyed bastard
that'll sink in a bathtub.

499
00:49:13,007 --> 00:49:14,715
Makes you cry to look at her.

500
00:49:17,470 --> 00:49:20,305
When you're serious,
I'll take you to Alvin Yark.

501
00:49:20,515 --> 00:49:22,306
He'll make ya
a sweet little Rodney.

502
00:49:25,228 --> 00:49:28,395
You don't have the sense
God gave a doughnut, do ya?

503
00:49:28,649 --> 00:49:29,811
I'm goin' home.

504
00:49:32,027 --> 00:49:36,357
Best you can do is bury it...
some dark night.

505
00:49:39,661 --> 00:49:42,033
What in hell is this?

506
00:49:43,957 --> 00:49:45,700
Hitler's Barge...?

507
00:49:46,293 --> 00:49:50,505
That's a vessel in port.
It goes with the Shipping News.

508
00:49:50,798 --> 00:49:52,790
What about the motorcycle accident?

509
00:49:53,050 --> 00:49:56,135
I'm still working on that.
I just think this is a better story.

510
00:49:58,306 --> 00:50:00,464
You didn't do the one that Jack
wanted you to do,

511
00:50:00,683 --> 00:50:02,890
and you did one he don't know you did!

512
00:50:04,229 --> 00:50:05,854
This is worse than yer boat.

513
00:50:06,064 --> 00:50:09,149
If Jack even sniffs this,
he'll cut you up for lobster bait.

514
00:50:11,487 --> 00:50:13,195
I think I'll run it.

515
00:50:27,379 --> 00:50:28,375
Hey, Bunny.

516
00:50:28,630 --> 00:50:30,789
Shh! I'm reading.

517
00:50:34,637 --> 00:50:36,630
He thinks I know how.

518
00:50:54,033 --> 00:50:56,405
Go on. Get the pig.

519
00:51:10,926 --> 00:51:13,678
- See you tomorrow.
- Bye, Sarah. Bye, Patrick.

520
00:51:15,431 --> 00:51:17,757
Could you hold these rods together for me?

521
00:51:17,976 --> 00:51:20,052
Hold them flush against each other.

522
00:51:24,024 --> 00:51:25,222
Be careful, honey.

523
00:51:25,484 --> 00:51:27,560
- I wanna see if it can fly!
- Not in the house.

524
00:51:27,820 --> 00:51:31,189
Throw it up in the air, high as
you can, and count till it comes down.

525
00:51:32,032 --> 00:51:34,820
One, two, three, four, five.

526
00:51:35,661 --> 00:51:37,239
Have you been to flight school?

527
00:51:37,497 --> 00:51:38,611
Not really.

528
00:51:57,769 --> 00:51:58,718
Aunt!

529
00:52:00,188 --> 00:52:01,386
Guess what?

530
00:52:03,024 --> 00:52:05,313
This is my assistant, Mavis Bangs.

531
00:52:07,404 --> 00:52:09,730
Did you read my article on the Hitler Boat?

532
00:52:16,539 --> 00:52:17,155
What?

533
00:52:17,957 --> 00:52:20,449
Silver and Bayonet Melville
were clients of mine.

534
00:52:20,710 --> 00:52:22,537
The jerks pulled anchor last night

535
00:52:22,754 --> 00:52:25,043
without payin' a penny
for all the work we did for 'em.

536
00:52:25,424 --> 00:52:28,840
You find out where they're to,
we'll give you the Pulitzer.

537
00:52:29,929 --> 00:52:33,428
What, you make juju beads
out of lobster feelers?

538
00:52:36,227 --> 00:52:38,137
Where do you export these?

539
00:53:04,883 --> 00:53:09,131
If you're gonna shanghai me office,
Tert, you'd best conceal the evidence.

540
00:53:11,223 --> 00:53:15,601
This "Hitler Boat"...
did you assign it?

541
00:53:16,396 --> 00:53:18,887
Nope, sir. It wasn't my idea.

542
00:53:20,817 --> 00:53:22,146
Get me Quoyle.

543
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:30,405
He wants you.

544
00:53:39,713 --> 00:53:40,827
Have a seat.

545
00:53:43,091 --> 00:53:46,840
I got four phone calls last night
about the Hitler Boat.

546
00:53:48,305 --> 00:53:51,141
People enjoyed it.
Mrs. Buggit liked it.

547
00:53:51,851 --> 00:53:56,264
'Course, you don't know nothin' about
boats, but that's entertainin' too.

548
00:53:57,816 --> 00:53:59,393
So, I'm giving you a weekly column.

549
00:53:59,609 --> 00:54:02,564
A story about a different boat every week.

550
00:54:02,946 --> 00:54:05,188
Human stuff. Who owned the boat,

551
00:54:05,407 --> 00:54:08,777
who lived and died on her,
who drowned, who was saved.

552
00:54:09,036 --> 00:54:12,702
Who lost his fortune.
Who had his heart broke.

553
00:54:13,833 --> 00:54:15,162
You follow?

554
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:21,000
Order this boy a new computer.

555
00:54:21,216 --> 00:54:24,217
And buy him a real one,
not one of them Japan clones.

556
00:54:27,473 --> 00:54:29,679
Mr. Buggit...
I don't know what to say...

557
00:54:29,934 --> 00:54:32,176
Did I not tell you my name is Jack?

558
00:54:44,283 --> 00:54:45,065
Jack.

559
00:54:56,796 --> 00:54:58,255
IBM, please.

560
00:55:01,593 --> 00:55:03,301
Get back to your work.

561
00:55:05,055 --> 00:55:08,804
IBM.

562
00:55:17,861 --> 00:55:20,566
"Lumbering Idiot Stuns Crowd...

563
00:55:21,740 --> 00:55:23,199
...For a Change."

564
00:55:36,089 --> 00:55:40,751
Herry Prowse!
Look how well your kite is doing!

565
00:55:41,136 --> 00:55:43,592
Are you making it dance
with your thoughts?

566
00:55:44,390 --> 00:55:48,008
Your kite is doing so much better
than Mr. Quoyle's!

567
00:55:57,904 --> 00:55:59,981
Do you think Bunny's strange?

568
00:56:00,991 --> 00:56:02,735
I mean, mentally.

569
00:56:04,036 --> 00:56:07,203
The Skinny Ghost? With the White Dog?

570
00:56:07,456 --> 00:56:08,915
She told you about that?

571
00:56:09,709 --> 00:56:13,493
Maybe she's sensitive.
The way some folks are around here.

572
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:19,673
What about the necklaces?
Do you know how many she makes?

573
00:56:21,638 --> 00:56:25,221
And I found her bashing her baby
doll's brains out with a hammer.

574
00:56:25,601 --> 00:56:28,602
A baby doll doesn't have brains.
It's a toy.

575
00:56:30,565 --> 00:56:35,192
She's saving a room for her mother.
Did she tell you that?

576
00:56:37,406 --> 00:56:40,905
Is she strange? Is she okay?
If you had to take a guess.

577
00:56:43,287 --> 00:56:46,122
That little girl's the only friend my son ever had.

578
00:56:47,166 --> 00:56:48,993
So she's strange, you bet.

579
00:56:50,378 --> 00:56:51,956
She crashed!

580
00:57:02,433 --> 00:57:03,892
Alright. There you go.

581
00:57:26,083 --> 00:57:27,957
Do you know how he died?

582
00:57:29,837 --> 00:57:31,166
My husband?

583
00:57:37,012 --> 00:57:39,847
It was a calm night
when Herold took the boat out.

584
00:57:41,350 --> 00:57:43,841
There was no sign of any storm.

585
00:57:45,563 --> 00:57:47,888
Storms can be sudden around here.

586
00:57:49,442 --> 00:57:51,980
He wasn't the only one whose boat went down.

587
00:57:56,658 --> 00:57:58,485
It's four years ago.

588
00:58:00,204 --> 00:58:01,995
And it's yesterday.

589
00:58:25,356 --> 00:58:28,856
Did I blow it, or can you still be my friend?

590
00:58:30,653 --> 00:58:33,987
Your friend.
Sure.

591
00:59:08,903 --> 00:59:10,101
Is this yours?

592
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:13,865
The ghost brought it.

593
00:59:16,203 --> 00:59:17,366
And then he ran away.

594
00:59:17,621 --> 00:59:19,661
The skinny ghost with the white dog?

595
00:59:21,208 --> 00:59:23,285
Don't say I dreamed it.

596
00:59:36,099 --> 00:59:38,935
You'll get the hang of it.
Now coax her a wee bit to starboard.

597
00:59:40,479 --> 00:59:43,765
That a boy. You're a Quoyle...
the sea water in your veins.

598
00:59:46,069 --> 00:59:47,777
How are things with your girl?

599
00:59:49,781 --> 00:59:52,106
Bunny's still adjusting, I think.

600
00:59:52,534 --> 00:59:54,859
No, I was talking about Wavey Prowse.

601
00:59:55,329 --> 00:59:56,491
Sorry... sorry!

602
01:00:01,168 --> 01:00:02,544
Wavey and I are just friends.

603
01:00:02,795 --> 01:00:05,167
Fine.
You don't have to drown me over it?

604
01:00:15,851 --> 01:00:19,979
This is where I grew up.
My poor old father, there.

605
01:00:25,778 --> 01:00:27,486
And that's where your house stood.

606
01:00:38,375 --> 01:00:40,499
Before they dragged it across the ice.

607
01:00:41,045 --> 01:00:43,334
Yes, sir. Before they was driven away.

608
01:00:46,551 --> 01:00:47,831
Driven away by what?

609
01:00:50,972 --> 01:00:51,921
You never knew?

610
01:00:53,308 --> 01:00:56,144
Ah, well...
it's neither here nor there, right?

611
01:00:56,395 --> 01:00:58,388
Point is they made
a new place for themselves.

612
01:00:58,647 --> 01:00:59,762
Driven away by what?

613
01:01:00,566 --> 01:01:02,108
That's old stuff.

614
01:01:02,860 --> 01:01:06,230
It's in my blood.
You ought to be able to tell me.

615
01:01:11,244 --> 01:01:13,403
Well, they come to Gaze Island
centuries ago.

616
01:01:13,664 --> 01:01:18,291
The old Quoyles were wrackers.
Pirates, sort of.

617
01:01:18,586 --> 01:01:19,866
You see them cairns?

618
01:01:22,256 --> 01:01:26,385
Fires used to burn in them to guide
the ships at sea, like lighthouses.

619
01:01:27,721 --> 01:01:32,050
The Quoyles would move the fires...
to fool the ships.

620
01:01:32,309 --> 01:01:35,310
Lure them into the rocks so
the Quoyles could grab their loot.

621
01:01:35,562 --> 01:01:37,721
They was a savage lot, the old Quoyles.

622
01:01:39,191 --> 01:01:43,059
Then they went too far one day.
They nailed a man to a tree.

623
01:01:44,614 --> 01:01:49,241
And they cut off his nose to draw the
nippers and flies that ate him alive.

624
01:01:51,788 --> 01:01:54,327
And that's when the Quoyles
was given their walking papers.

625
01:01:55,793 --> 01:01:56,955
Jesus.

626
01:01:57,962 --> 01:02:01,461
There's still an old Quoyle down
in one of these coves somewhere.

627
01:02:02,425 --> 01:02:05,047
They say he slept with his wife
after she was dead.

628
01:02:07,264 --> 01:02:08,758
Anything else I should know?

629
01:02:11,643 --> 01:02:13,102
That about covers it.

630
01:02:21,988 --> 01:02:25,439
When the knitting pins you is abreast...

631
01:02:26,660 --> 01:02:29,281
pull the tiller to the west.

632
01:02:31,415 --> 01:02:33,953
Behind the pins you must steer...

633
01:02:35,002 --> 01:02:39,380
till the old man's shoe it does appear.

634
01:03:31,230 --> 01:03:32,772
Show me that necklace.

635
01:03:33,691 --> 01:03:36,561
If you make the loops bigger
you don't have to make so many.

636
01:03:38,946 --> 01:03:40,026
Good morning.

637
01:03:44,244 --> 01:03:45,738
Can I talk to you for a minute?

638
01:03:52,086 --> 01:03:53,366
Where's that chair from?

639
01:03:55,005 --> 01:03:55,622
Excuse me?

640
01:03:55,881 --> 01:03:58,503
The chair you're sitting in.
Where'd you get it?

641
01:03:59,093 --> 01:04:03,138
It's not from around here, right?
It's foreign, exotic.

642
01:04:04,766 --> 01:04:06,925
I don't want pirate's loot in this home.

643
01:04:08,437 --> 01:04:10,264
Billy Pretty told me all about it.

644
01:04:12,024 --> 01:04:13,981
It's a good thing somebody finally did.

645
01:04:16,112 --> 01:04:18,235
I don't believe in dwelling in the past.

646
01:04:18,614 --> 01:04:21,070
No? Then what are we doing here?

647
01:04:21,326 --> 01:04:22,737
Making a future.

648
01:04:27,541 --> 01:04:27,991
Well, well, well... if it ain't
the second coming of the Quoyles.

649
01:04:32,212 --> 01:04:34,918
Taking a long and hearty meal break,
I can't help but notice.

650
01:04:36,217 --> 01:04:38,091
Hope you got a good idea
for your next story.

651
01:04:38,344 --> 01:04:40,301
I'd hate for Jack to think
it was just beginner's luck.

652
01:04:40,555 --> 01:04:42,429
Let the man digest.

653
01:04:43,141 --> 01:04:45,846
If I was the esteemed author
of the shipping news column...

654
01:04:46,103 --> 01:04:48,808
I'd pick up the oil field story.

655
01:04:49,064 --> 01:04:51,436
Petro dollars. Golden flood of jobs.

656
01:04:51,817 --> 01:04:55,269
You write about that, I'll put it
right there on the front page.

657
01:04:55,529 --> 01:04:57,107
Thank you for stopping by, Tert.

658
01:04:57,573 --> 01:04:59,116
Yeah, thanks, Tert.

659
01:05:04,498 --> 01:05:05,696
What was that all about?

660
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:11,045
He owns Mobile Oil. Ten shares.

661
01:05:14,300 --> 01:05:15,498
What about your column?

662
01:05:16,844 --> 01:05:17,959
What about it?

663
01:05:18,262 --> 01:05:19,721
You said you'd read it to me.

664
01:05:21,683 --> 01:05:23,474
I will, once the game is done.

665
01:05:28,857 --> 01:05:32,807
"There's a 1904 photo hung
in the Killick-Claw Library."

666
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:36,322
"Eight schooners heading out
to the fishing grounds."

667
01:05:36,616 --> 01:05:39,154
"Their sails are white and beautiful."

668
01:05:39,786 --> 01:05:41,992
"But nowadays you're just as likely to see

669
01:05:42,205 --> 01:05:43,997
a big black shape of an oil tanker."

670
01:05:44,249 --> 01:05:46,206
"Like the ruptured Golden Goose."

671
01:05:46,585 --> 01:05:49,372
"Last week it leaked 14,000 tons of crude..."

672
01:05:49,630 --> 01:05:52,666
"onto the seabirds,
fish and boats at Cape Despond."

673
01:05:53,384 --> 01:05:55,341
"There will be more and more tankers."

674
01:05:55,595 --> 01:05:58,881
They will get old and corroded
and their tanks will split."

675
01:05:59,557 --> 01:06:03,223
"And there will be less fish, and less fishermen."

676
01:06:04,229 --> 01:06:08,523
"Nobody hangs a picture of an oil
tanker on their wall, do they?"

677
01:06:12,863 --> 01:06:13,895
What do you think?

678
01:06:17,493 --> 01:06:18,774
I think when Tert Card sees it...

679
01:06:19,037 --> 01:06:22,073
he'll stay up nights thinking
of cheap shots to pay you back.

680
01:06:22,916 --> 01:06:25,241
I think he won't stop until you're fired.

681
01:06:30,216 --> 01:06:32,208
I think I haven't been so proud of a friend...

682
01:06:34,554 --> 01:06:36,381
since I don't know when.

683
01:06:54,700 --> 01:06:57,904
What do you think?
Pretty impressive, huh?

684
01:06:58,371 --> 01:07:00,494
Like I said, nobody hangs one of those.

685
01:07:01,791 --> 01:07:06,169
Your column's front page stuff.
Only now it's more a caption.

686
01:07:07,214 --> 01:07:11,627
"More than three thousand tankers
proudly ride the world's seas."

687
01:07:12,511 --> 01:07:14,385
"Even the biggest take advantage of

688
01:07:14,597 --> 01:07:17,135
Newfoundland's deepwater
ports and refineries."

689
01:07:17,392 --> 01:07:20,179
Spelled it all perfect
so as not to embarrass you.

690
01:07:20,478 --> 01:07:23,645
"Oil and Newfoundland go together
like ham and eggs."

691
01:07:23,899 --> 01:07:27,767
"And like ham and eggs they'll
nourish us in the coming years."

692
01:07:28,571 --> 01:07:30,195
Even put your name on it.

693
01:07:31,991 --> 01:07:36,618
"Let's all hang a picture
of an oil tanker on our wall."

694
01:07:38,331 --> 01:07:39,612
A man of your principles...

695
01:07:40,542 --> 01:07:43,958
I understand the only
honorable course is resignation.

696
01:07:48,092 --> 01:07:50,797
If you're off to see Jack Buggit,
you'll have to swim.

697
01:07:51,429 --> 01:07:54,964
I run the Gammy Bird, every inch of it.
Which he'd have to do without me.

698
01:07:55,308 --> 01:07:58,558
And if you think
he's gonna choose you over fishing,

699
01:07:58,853 --> 01:08:01,142
then you're dumber than a doughnut.

700
01:08:03,442 --> 01:08:04,984
If that's possible.

701
01:08:32,724 --> 01:08:35,345
For Christ sakes, Quoyle, shut your motor.

702
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:54,245
What's the emergency.
Can't it wait till I'm done fishing?

703
01:08:54,497 --> 01:08:58,281
It's about my column.
Card printed it not the way I wrote it.

704
01:08:58,627 --> 01:08:59,622
So?

705
01:09:02,422 --> 01:09:04,878
Do you disapprove
of how Card runs my newspaper?

706
01:09:06,427 --> 01:09:07,921
Enough to lose your job?

707
01:09:10,681 --> 01:09:11,713
Yes or no?

708
01:09:13,309 --> 01:09:14,258
Yes.

709
01:09:36,251 --> 01:09:39,335
So, this is what Jack and I think.

710
01:09:39,796 --> 01:09:44,174
We want to run Quoyle's wrong headed
oil spill story because controversy...

711
01:09:44,426 --> 01:09:47,463
sells papers. And papers sells ads.

712
01:09:50,975 --> 01:09:53,597
But the oil tanker picture stays.

713
01:10:06,325 --> 01:10:10,157
You should've seen Tert's face.
It was a beautiful thing.

714
01:10:10,413 --> 01:10:11,872
That's alright, I've seen it.

715
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:21,797
Let's see what tonight's special is.

716
01:10:30,184 --> 01:10:32,011
How do you feel about ordering to go?

717
01:10:36,942 --> 01:10:38,436
You ever had that before?

718
01:10:39,152 --> 01:10:41,145
- No, what is it?
- Seal flipper pie.

719
01:10:43,866 --> 01:10:46,867
It's made from the knuckle part of the flipper.

720
01:10:48,496 --> 01:10:49,907
The slimey cartilage part.

721
01:10:52,542 --> 01:10:56,670
It's good, though. A good choice,
if you like that sort of thing.

722
01:10:57,589 --> 01:10:59,463
Y'know, I'm really not all that hungry.

723
01:10:59,716 --> 01:11:04,011
I just wanted to come and sit.
I had a big lunch.

724
01:11:06,223 --> 01:11:07,848
They say you're not a real Newfoundlander...

725
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:11,185
until you've had a piece of seal flipper pie.

726
01:11:15,483 --> 01:11:17,523
- That's what they say?
- Yeah, it is.

727
01:11:29,248 --> 01:11:30,162
That's surprising.

728
01:11:31,584 --> 01:11:33,209
I never eat it, myself.

729
01:11:33,837 --> 01:11:37,206
You never eat this?
This is horrible.

730
01:11:38,592 --> 01:11:41,297
Here, I got you some real food.

731
01:14:30,362 --> 01:14:34,146
Christ!
I knowed somebody was out here.

732
01:14:43,501 --> 01:14:44,912
Oh, for Christ's sake!

733
01:15:05,650 --> 01:15:07,939
He's still burning off the fever.

734
01:15:23,169 --> 01:15:24,544
Any feeling yet?

735
01:15:26,840 --> 01:15:28,298
Little tingles.

736
01:15:31,887 --> 01:15:32,836
You're lucky.

737
01:15:34,014 --> 01:15:34,880
I'm fine.

738
01:15:35,140 --> 01:15:39,388
I'll be ready to get back in that
water in another 20, 30 years.

739
01:15:41,856 --> 01:15:43,896
Do you know how close you were to dying?

740
01:15:49,364 --> 01:15:51,772
Get my Uncle Alvin Yark
to build you a proper boat.

741
01:15:52,034 --> 01:15:53,825
And learn how to use it, okay?

742
01:15:56,038 --> 01:15:57,318
Okay.

743
01:15:59,125 --> 01:16:00,074
Good.

744
01:16:15,142 --> 01:16:16,886
Were the eyes open, or closed?

745
01:16:17,144 --> 01:16:20,015
Don't know.
Just said it was a disembodied head.

746
01:16:21,149 --> 01:16:22,940
What did the police have to say about it?

747
01:16:23,234 --> 01:16:24,349
They're still working on it.

748
01:16:25,361 --> 01:16:27,568
A little late to return
the head to its owner, though.

749
01:16:32,077 --> 01:16:33,073
Hello, nephew.

750
01:16:34,204 --> 01:16:38,748
Police bulletin. "Mrs. Silver Melville
was arrested early today..."

751
01:16:39,001 --> 01:16:41,955
"in Lanai, Hawaii
for the murder of her husbad..."

752
01:16:42,213 --> 01:16:46,045
"socialite and racanteur Mr. Bayonet Melville."

753
01:16:46,301 --> 01:16:49,219
"'He pushed me once too often,"
Mrs. Melville confessed."

754
01:16:49,471 --> 01:16:51,464
"'So I finally pushed back. '"

755
01:16:52,307 --> 01:16:53,932
Good for you, my dear.

756
01:16:58,773 --> 01:17:00,481
He probably deserved it.

757
01:17:14,123 --> 01:17:15,403
Don't get your hopes up.

758
01:17:15,708 --> 01:17:18,828
You're the first man that ever cooked
for me. You got a lot of leeway.

759
01:17:20,797 --> 01:17:21,579
How are they?

760
01:17:22,215 --> 01:17:24,587
They're both asleep. In Bunny's bed.

761
01:17:25,719 --> 01:17:26,750
Should we trust them?

762
01:17:32,810 --> 01:17:35,052
Here, let me do that.

763
01:17:44,489 --> 01:17:46,778
Can you feel that?
Through the bandage?

764
01:18:11,059 --> 01:18:11,842
What?

765
01:18:17,191 --> 01:18:21,438
Your husband...
he never cooked you a meal?

766
01:18:24,366 --> 01:18:26,323
Why are we talking about my husband?

767
01:18:28,286 --> 01:18:29,911
Because I understand.

768
01:18:31,331 --> 01:18:34,167
You said it's four years ago
and it's yesterday.

769
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:39,375
I understand that.

770
01:18:42,427 --> 01:18:44,918
My husband's not who
we're talking about, right?

771
01:18:56,651 --> 01:19:00,269
I'll go get Herry. He wouldn't like
waking up in a strange bed.

772
01:20:05,183 --> 01:20:06,132
Who are you?

773
01:20:11,941 --> 01:20:16,105
I tied magic in these knots...
to protect you from the house

774
01:20:16,738 --> 01:20:19,774
No good ever come from the old place.
Never.

775
01:20:23,328 --> 01:20:27,160
You have no business in the Quoyle house.

776
01:20:28,333 --> 01:20:29,792
I'll get you out of there.

777
01:20:30,044 --> 01:20:31,158
But I am a Quoyle.

778
01:20:31,879 --> 01:20:32,875
A Quoyle?

779
01:20:33,506 --> 01:20:37,290
I was a Quoyle... before you was anything.

780
01:20:39,971 --> 01:20:41,086
Leave the house.

781
01:20:43,016 --> 01:20:45,970
Tell Agnis hello...

782
01:20:47,020 --> 01:20:48,135
from Cousin Nolan.

783
01:20:50,691 --> 01:20:52,980
You know why Agnis come back?

784
01:20:54,362 --> 01:20:57,067
To show she ain't afraid of the place no more.

785
01:20:59,033 --> 01:21:01,655
I know what she's done.

786
01:21:03,705 --> 01:21:08,083
She got rid of the baby she was
carrying. What could she do?

787
01:21:09,461 --> 01:21:12,166
She was only twelve.

788
01:21:13,049 --> 01:21:17,676
And it was her own brother
that done it to her.

789
01:22:23,375 --> 01:22:24,834
Does that belong to you?

790
01:22:25,627 --> 01:22:26,409
Sorry.

791
01:22:30,466 --> 01:22:32,922
There's still hot water in
the kettle if you want some tea.

792
01:22:36,431 --> 01:22:38,803
I've started looking for
a place for me and Bunny.

793
01:22:40,060 --> 01:22:41,851
You sure you're going
to be okay at your shop?

794
01:22:43,355 --> 01:22:44,636
I said I would, didn't I?

795
01:22:55,159 --> 01:22:58,161
I think Silver Melville was right
to chop her husband's head off.

796
01:23:00,248 --> 01:23:01,624
He probably deserved it.

797
01:23:12,512 --> 01:23:14,754
I think more women should do what she did.

798
01:23:18,935 --> 01:23:21,391
Maybe some should've done it
to their own brother.

799
01:23:26,485 --> 01:23:27,648
My father.

800
01:23:30,948 --> 01:23:33,237
Cousin Nolan dropped by last night.

801
01:24:07,071 --> 01:24:11,283
I always thought if anyone knew
I'd be turned to stone.

802
01:24:13,244 --> 01:24:14,525
Shit!

803
01:24:36,269 --> 01:24:37,680
Tea is a good drink.

804
01:24:39,272 --> 01:24:40,553
It'll keep you going.

805
01:24:50,034 --> 01:24:51,826
When someone hurts you that much...

806
01:24:53,788 --> 01:24:55,247
how do you...

807
01:24:58,543 --> 01:25:00,203
Does it ever go away?

808
01:25:03,716 --> 01:25:05,091
Is it possible?

809
01:25:38,795 --> 01:25:43,422
Her name was Irene. The love of my life.

810
01:25:53,186 --> 01:25:54,811
You look happy.

811
01:25:58,358 --> 01:26:01,941
So, yeah... it is possible.

812
01:26:08,369 --> 01:26:09,448
Agnis tells me we got to move for the winter.

813
01:26:11,372 --> 01:26:14,243
It'll be a three hour drive from here
to the point. All the ice.

814
01:26:14,709 --> 01:26:17,117
Me and Bunny are gonna have to find
a room in town somewhere.

815
01:26:17,379 --> 01:26:19,668
I'll have the usual, please. Thank you.

816
01:26:26,180 --> 01:26:30,130
If it's a place to stay you need
you can have my trailer.

817
01:26:30,727 --> 01:26:32,138
The timing's perfect.

818
01:26:32,812 --> 01:26:33,678
What are you talking about?

819
01:26:33,980 --> 01:26:38,607
My boat's ready. If I stay here any
longer I might begin to like the place.

820
01:26:39,069 --> 01:26:41,821
I'm throwing myself
a farewell party on Saturday.

821
01:26:42,573 --> 01:26:44,281
Departure to follow Sunday.

822
01:26:44,533 --> 01:26:45,732
A rootless traitor.

823
01:26:46,494 --> 01:26:48,700
Regrets soon after, no doubt.

824
01:27:03,763 --> 01:27:05,387
Quoyle of the North.

825
01:27:10,395 --> 01:27:12,269
Have you and Wavey done the dirty yet?

826
01:27:14,065 --> 01:27:15,726
She's a grieving widow.

827
01:27:17,945 --> 01:27:20,566
Grieving for Herrold Prowse?
Oh, that's a good one.

828
01:27:22,616 --> 01:27:25,072
Let me tell you something
about old Herrold Prowse.

829
01:27:25,953 --> 01:27:27,496
It's like a party game in town...

830
01:27:28,581 --> 01:27:31,748
to look at babies and see if they look like Herrod.

831
01:27:40,094 --> 01:27:41,754
To Nutbeem!

832
01:27:44,891 --> 01:27:47,761
We all love fucking Nutbeem, huh?

833
01:27:49,938 --> 01:27:51,977
Let's us keep him here, then.

834
01:27:54,025 --> 01:27:55,734
Got your chainsaw?

835
01:29:29,087 --> 01:29:30,036
What's wrong?

836
01:29:31,006 --> 01:29:34,873
I'm a Quoyle.
I'm one of the Quoyles.

837
01:29:36,679 --> 01:29:39,051
Pirates and looters and murderers.

838
01:29:40,266 --> 01:29:42,555
My father raped his little sister.

839
01:29:43,853 --> 01:29:45,727
And then he taught me how to swim.

840
01:29:49,818 --> 01:29:53,068
Stop that.
Jesus, you smell like a brewery.

841
01:30:02,331 --> 01:30:03,446
Stop it!

842
01:30:11,717 --> 01:30:12,997
Sorry, Herry.

843
01:30:18,891 --> 01:30:23,221
I'm sorry, Petal. I'm so sorry.

844
01:30:27,400 --> 01:30:28,776
I meant Wavey.

845
01:30:30,403 --> 01:30:32,859
Good. I feel much better.

846
01:30:35,075 --> 01:30:38,361
When were you going to tell me
about your fucked up marriage?

847
01:31:19,290 --> 01:31:21,746
I'm scrambling eggs.
You gonna be able to eat?

848
01:31:23,461 --> 01:31:24,243
No.

849
01:31:28,133 --> 01:31:29,248
Listen, I'm...

850
01:31:36,809 --> 01:31:38,434
Maybe I should just go.

851
01:31:42,941 --> 01:31:44,435
You forget where the door is?

852
01:32:07,926 --> 01:32:11,378
He ran off to Winnipeg with some
little bitch barely out of high school.

853
01:32:12,347 --> 01:32:13,972
Is that fucked up enough for you?

854
01:32:15,851 --> 01:32:18,971
Herrold, my husband, he didn't die.

855
01:32:19,897 --> 01:32:21,356
Not that he didn't deserve to.

856
01:32:23,026 --> 01:32:25,897
He left me when I was eight months
pregnant and no good to him in bed.

857
01:32:27,447 --> 01:32:31,148
So I took his 15-footer into the bay,
cracked the hull with a hatchet...

858
01:32:31,452 --> 01:32:35,319
and sunk her.
And pretended he was drowned.

859
01:32:36,374 --> 01:32:40,419
And played the grieving widow.
And packed my bags to leave town.

860
01:32:41,713 --> 01:32:45,497
But then a funny thing happened.
All these folk I grew up with...

861
01:32:45,884 --> 01:32:48,885
they put their hearts around me
and Herry so we wouldn't be alone.

862
01:32:50,722 --> 01:32:52,347
And I just couldn't leave.

863
01:32:54,059 --> 01:32:55,602
I'm sorry, Wavey.

864
01:32:56,479 --> 01:32:58,187
You're always sorry.

865
01:33:39,525 --> 01:33:41,068
You're looking dishy, Quoyle.

866
01:33:42,862 --> 01:33:46,991
I'm afraid my offer to let you stay in
my trailer will have to be retracted.

867
01:33:52,957 --> 01:33:57,085
Sorry about that and your boat.

868
01:33:58,838 --> 01:34:01,294
I'm some disgusted with the human race.

869
01:34:03,468 --> 01:34:07,418
I never would have made it.
Storms would've blown me to bits.

870
01:34:08,974 --> 01:34:11,097
You boys saved my life, I imagine.

871
01:34:13,104 --> 01:34:16,058
I've gathered up my savings
and I'm flying back to Brazil.

872
01:34:17,233 --> 01:34:20,685
Where the water is swimming pool green.

873
01:34:23,907 --> 01:34:25,864
You and Bunny can stay with the wife and me.

874
01:34:30,164 --> 01:34:31,409
To Brazil.

875
01:34:41,634 --> 01:34:43,711
We could stay with Aunt Agnis at her shop.

876
01:34:44,012 --> 01:34:45,886
There's barely enough room there for myself.

877
01:34:46,515 --> 01:34:49,220
- You'll like it at Dennis' house.
- No, I won't.

878
01:34:52,021 --> 01:34:54,642
- Welcome, weary travelers.
- Our home is your home.

879
01:34:56,067 --> 01:34:58,819
C'mon in, sweetie.
I made a big seal flipper pie.

880
01:35:00,321 --> 01:35:03,358
- What's that?
- Weather light. Storm coming.

881
01:35:03,992 --> 01:35:04,988
Big one.

882
01:35:44,328 --> 01:35:46,866
The house. The house.

883
01:37:10,504 --> 01:37:14,004
What is it, Quoyle? What?

884
01:39:30,490 --> 01:39:31,770
It's gone.

885
01:39:34,160 --> 01:39:36,118
The green house is gone.

886
01:39:40,667 --> 01:39:42,210
I didn't dream it.

887
01:39:44,129 --> 01:39:45,873
Don't say I did.

888
01:39:54,516 --> 01:39:56,307
Hi, Mom. Some storm, eh?

889
01:40:10,033 --> 01:40:12,488
Yes. Yes, of course.

890
01:40:33,975 --> 01:40:35,517
What's a wake?

891
01:40:37,187 --> 01:40:38,681
It's to say goodbye.

892
01:40:39,398 --> 01:40:42,269
Mr. Buggit is sleeping with the angels.

893
01:40:50,994 --> 01:40:51,610
Dennis!

894
01:40:51,911 --> 01:40:53,489
Yeah, I'm still looking
for my dad's navy medal.

895
01:40:53,747 --> 01:40:54,577
I found it.

896
01:41:02,673 --> 01:41:03,539
Mom.

897
01:41:07,929 --> 01:41:10,883
I found it... in his desk, at the office.

898
01:41:11,599 --> 01:41:15,134
Would you write something for
The Gammy Bird about Jack?

899
01:41:17,147 --> 01:41:18,428
Yes, I'll try.

900
01:41:23,279 --> 01:41:25,568
Jack is alright now.

901
01:41:27,825 --> 01:41:31,574
You all know we are only passing by.

902
01:41:33,039 --> 01:41:35,875
We walk over these stones a few times.

903
01:41:37,044 --> 01:41:41,172
Our boats sail for
a little while on the waves...

904
01:41:41,423 --> 01:41:43,463
and then they have to sink.

905
01:41:44,260 --> 01:41:48,887
Jack knew that better than anyone.
Right, Jack? Yes, boy.

906
01:42:11,414 --> 01:42:12,612
He's awake!

907
01:42:17,462 --> 01:42:18,328
Get a doctor!

908
01:42:28,725 --> 01:42:33,102
Come here, son. I beat the curse.
The fishing license is yours.

909
01:42:43,699 --> 01:42:45,491
Sweetheart, you ready?

910
01:42:46,202 --> 01:42:47,862
I want to have a wake for Petal.

911
01:42:49,122 --> 01:42:52,787
Why didn't we have a wake?
Why didn't we wake her up?

912
01:42:53,710 --> 01:42:54,991
It worked for him.

913
01:42:58,048 --> 01:43:02,592
Honey, Mr. Buggit wasn't really...
It's more like he was in a coma.

914
01:43:02,887 --> 01:43:05,045
From the cold water.
It's like he was sleeping.

915
01:43:05,306 --> 01:43:06,504
Petal was asleep.

916
01:43:08,059 --> 01:43:10,182
You said she was asleep with the angels.

917
01:43:10,603 --> 01:43:13,521
I know what I said, but she's not sleeping.

918
01:43:16,401 --> 01:43:18,857
I know what I said. Listen to me...

919
01:43:20,406 --> 01:43:22,778
I was too scared to tell you the truth.

920
01:43:25,745 --> 01:43:27,120
Petal is dead.

921
01:43:31,293 --> 01:43:34,578
And you know that. I know you know it.

922
01:43:43,639 --> 01:43:45,182
Is it because of me?

923
01:43:48,770 --> 01:43:50,561
That she drove away.

924
01:43:51,189 --> 01:43:52,981
Why would you say that?

925
01:43:56,403 --> 01:43:58,361
Because I'm boring.

926
01:44:09,292 --> 01:44:11,332
No, honey, it's not because of you.

927
01:44:14,464 --> 01:44:16,504
And you are anything but boring.

928
01:44:28,021 --> 01:44:29,599
You believe me, don't you?

929
01:44:33,610 --> 01:44:37,560
You still don't believe me. Do you?

930
01:44:39,492 --> 01:44:41,034
About the house.

931
01:44:45,582 --> 01:44:46,957
I told you so.

932
01:45:01,265 --> 01:45:02,131
It's alright.

933
01:45:03,643 --> 01:45:06,597
Worse things have happened.
To both of us.

934
01:45:08,857 --> 01:45:11,562
Maybe one day we'll build
a summer house out here?

935
01:45:13,320 --> 01:45:14,601
Summer.

936
01:45:16,365 --> 01:45:18,239
Do they have summer here?

937
01:45:18,868 --> 01:45:21,904
You'll know it's summer when
the partridge berries are out.

938
01:45:22,455 --> 01:45:26,405
And we can make partridge berry
duff and sweet berry okie.

939
01:45:28,044 --> 01:45:29,503
Will you show me how?

940
01:45:30,380 --> 01:45:33,500
I will, yeah. I will.

941
01:45:35,886 --> 01:45:38,259
There are still so many things I don't know.

942
01:45:39,724 --> 01:45:42,678
If a piece of knotted string
can unleash the wind...

943
01:45:43,394 --> 01:45:45,767
and if a drowned man can awaken...

944
01:45:47,565 --> 01:45:50,353
then I believe a broken man can heal.

945
01:45:57,993 --> 01:46:02,455
Headline: "Deadly Storm Takes House."

946
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:08,627
"Leaves Excellent View."
