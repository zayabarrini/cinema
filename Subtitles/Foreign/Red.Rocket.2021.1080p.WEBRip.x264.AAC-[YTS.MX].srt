00:02:30,993 --> 00:02:33,628
Hey, Lexi.
It's me, Mikey.

3
00:02:34,496 --> 00:02:35,430
Mikey.

4
00:02:35,463 --> 00:02:37,800
No, no, no, no. Don't hang up.
Don't hang up.

5
00:02:37,834 --> 00:02:41,804
I got a big fucking
surprise for you.

6
00:02:44,774 --> 00:02:47,076
- Who is it?
- I was cleaning...

7
00:02:47,109 --> 00:02:48,978
Hey! Surprise!

8
00:02:49,011 --> 00:02:50,913
Hey. Hey, Lil.

9
00:02:50,947 --> 00:02:52,748
Oh, my shit.

10
00:02:52,782 --> 00:02:54,750
Nice to see
you, too, uh...

11
00:02:54,784 --> 00:02:56,118
How you been?
How you been?

12
00:02:57,452 --> 00:02:59,121
Okay...

13
00:02:59,155 --> 00:03:01,991
- It's me, Mikey. Remember me?
- I know.

14
00:03:02,024 --> 00:03:04,060
I know.
What are you doing here for?

15
00:03:04,093 --> 00:03:06,128
Well, I just
came to see Lexi,

16
00:03:06,162 --> 00:03:07,596
and, well, I came
to see you of course.

17
00:03:07,629 --> 00:03:09,531
Both of you guys.
But is Lexi here right now?

18
00:03:09,932 --> 00:03:11,000
Lexi!

19
00:03:11,033 --> 00:03:12,068
- Thank you.
- What?

20
00:03:12,101 --> 00:03:13,870
You won't believe
who's here.

21
00:03:14,536 --> 00:03:15,938
Oh, my gosh.

22
00:03:17,807 --> 00:03:19,075
Oh, my shit.

23
00:03:19,108 --> 00:03:20,542
Surprise!

24
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:22,879
Oh, my God, what the...
What are you doing here?

25
00:03:22,912 --> 00:03:24,881
Aw! It's good
to see you, too.

26
00:03:24,914 --> 00:03:25,982
Why are you here?

27
00:03:26,015 --> 00:03:28,150
Fuck. Oh, God damn it.
Where do I begin. Uh, look...

28
00:03:28,184 --> 00:03:29,484
No, you're not coming
in this house.

29
00:03:29,517 --> 00:03:30,887
- All beat up.
- That's right.

30
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,755
- What... What the fuck?
- All right...

31
00:03:32,788 --> 00:03:35,124
All right, well,
I'll tell you what's...

32
00:03:35,157 --> 00:03:37,126
Yeah,
why are you here?

33
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:38,728
- Yeah.
- Uh, well...

34
00:03:38,761 --> 00:03:39,661
Why are you here?

35
00:03:39,695 --> 00:03:41,097
Mom, Mom,
can you give me a minute?

36
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:42,164
Lil, I just wanted
to come in,

37
00:03:42,198 --> 00:03:43,565
and hang
for a couple of days.

38
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:45,134
No, you're not
coming in here.

39
00:03:45,167 --> 00:03:46,202
You're not coming
in my house.

40
00:03:46,235 --> 00:03:48,570
Mom, can you
just go inside and...

41
00:03:49,638 --> 00:03:52,008
- The fuck, Mikey?
- I... I know.

42
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:53,608
I know.
This is unexpected.

43
00:03:53,642 --> 00:03:55,711
Oh, nothing with you
is unexpected.

44
00:03:55,745 --> 00:03:58,613
You still got that sass!

45
00:04:00,816 --> 00:04:02,852
Look, I don't know
what you want,

46
00:04:02,885 --> 00:04:04,687
but I can't help you.

47
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,757
So it doesn't matter how
or why you're here.

48
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:08,925
Go away.

49
00:04:09,792 --> 00:04:12,661
- Hey, Lil.
- Ma!

50
00:04:12,695 --> 00:04:14,562
- God damn it.
- Look, I don't want

51
00:04:14,596 --> 00:04:15,530
to be here, all right?
This is embarrassing.

52
00:04:15,563 --> 00:04:16,498
Well, I don't
want you here either.

53
00:04:16,531 --> 00:04:17,733
You think I want to
show up like this?

54
00:04:17,767 --> 00:04:20,002
I got my ass fuckin' kicked.
I just need a place to crash.

55
00:04:20,036 --> 00:04:21,670
- Why can't you be cool?
- What does it look like?

56
00:04:21,704 --> 00:04:23,172
- A hotel?
- Really? It's like that?

57
00:04:23,205 --> 00:04:25,507
Can you get off
the property, please?

58
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,642
What, why... What are you
fucking going do? Really?

59
00:04:27,677 --> 00:04:29,045
Well, you...
Oh, you want me to call the cops?

60
00:04:29,078 --> 00:04:30,578
- I'll call the cops.
- Don't. Don't fucking...

61
00:04:30,612 --> 00:04:32,480
- No, I'm calling the cops.
- Fuck!

62
00:04:32,514 --> 00:04:34,083
- Nine, eight...
- God...

63
00:04:34,116 --> 00:04:36,118
Seven... Faster!

64
00:04:36,152 --> 00:04:37,619
I'm technically
off the property,

65
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:38,721
so you can't
call the cops,

66
00:04:38,754 --> 00:04:41,656
because I'm on public land
respecting your boundaries!

67
00:04:41,691 --> 00:04:43,558
- Can you keep it down?
- Can you come over here

68
00:04:43,591 --> 00:04:45,593
so I don't have to project my
voice, please?

69
00:04:45,627 --> 00:04:47,229
Oh, fuck!

70
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:51,033
Seriously, I just need a place
to crash for a couple of days.

71
00:04:51,067 --> 00:04:54,203
- What's the big deal?
- Mikey, go fuck yourself.

72
00:04:54,236 --> 00:04:56,172
Oh, you don't even know
what I've been through.

73
00:04:56,205 --> 00:04:58,040
- Oh, right.
- Look at my fucking face!

74
00:04:58,074 --> 00:04:59,742
I just was
on a bus for two days.

75
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:01,576
I had to walk here
from the bus station...

76
00:05:01,609 --> 00:05:02,979
Why don't you stay
with your mama!

77
00:05:03,012 --> 00:05:04,981
My mom's in a nursing home
in Le Marque.

78
00:05:05,014 --> 00:05:06,882
A care home.
I can't sleep there.

79
00:05:08,017 --> 00:05:09,584
Mikey,
what do you want?

80
00:05:09,617 --> 00:05:10,886
- My God, I just...
- What do you want?

81
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,088
I just fucking told you.

82
00:05:12,121 --> 00:05:14,724
I just need to crash
for a couple days.

83
00:05:14,757 --> 00:05:15,891
What, you want money,
right? Here.

84
00:05:15,925 --> 00:05:19,862
- I don't want fucking money.
- I got 22 fucking dollars.

85
00:05:19,895 --> 00:05:21,663
Here, come get it.
I can't come on your property.

86
00:05:21,697 --> 00:05:23,565
- Come get your money.
- You should've called!

87
00:05:23,598 --> 00:05:26,168
If I would've called,
you would've said "no."

88
00:05:26,202 --> 00:05:27,970
I'm still saying "no,"

89
00:05:28,004 --> 00:05:29,305
so you fucked yourself
by coming.

90
00:05:29,338 --> 00:05:31,741
Oh, please, come on.
You know me.

91
00:05:31,774 --> 00:05:32,975
Damn straight, I do.

92
00:05:33,009 --> 00:05:34,043
You know me
and you know

93
00:05:34,076 --> 00:05:35,111
I wouldn't be
literally begging

94
00:05:35,144 --> 00:05:36,178
if I had
somewhere to go.

95
00:05:36,212 --> 00:05:37,246
And if you don't
let me in,

96
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:39,215
I'm going to sleep in
Tarpey fucking Park tonight,

97
00:05:39,248 --> 00:05:40,548
is that what you want?

98
00:05:40,582 --> 00:05:41,616
You said
you were never going

99
00:05:41,649 --> 00:05:43,252
to step a foot
in Texas again.

100
00:05:43,285 --> 00:05:46,022
And then the world fucked
me, what can I say.

101
00:05:46,756 --> 00:05:48,791
- Peek-a-boo!
- Ma!

102
00:05:48,824 --> 00:05:50,326
See, your mom's saying,
"Let him in.

103
00:05:50,359 --> 00:05:51,727
"Let him in
and take a shower."

104
00:05:51,761 --> 00:05:52,828
And the dog's like,

105
00:05:52,862 --> 00:05:55,264
"Oh, he's a good man,
I can tell by his nice energy."

106
00:05:55,297 --> 00:05:57,665
Please let me take
a fucking shower.

107
00:06:19,088 --> 00:06:21,290
<i>The shit got
out of fucking control.</i>

108
00:06:21,323 --> 00:06:22,725
<i>If I didn't see it
with my own eyes,</i>

109
00:06:22,758 --> 00:06:23,692
<i>I wouldn't believe it.</i>

110
00:06:23,726 --> 00:06:25,694
The place turned
into a fucking trap house

111
00:06:25,728 --> 00:06:26,962
right under my nose.

112
00:06:26,996 --> 00:06:29,231
Fucking Speigler sends me
some scraggly bitch from Ohio

113
00:06:29,265 --> 00:06:31,000
that he promised
would be chill.

114
00:06:31,033 --> 00:06:32,802
Her first night in the
house, she gets in a fight,

115
00:06:32,835 --> 00:06:34,370
knocks this
fucking bitch out.

116
00:06:34,403 --> 00:06:37,106
Crack. Right in front of me.
I was like, "Holy shit!"

117
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:38,274
So, anyway, she bounced.

118
00:06:38,307 --> 00:06:40,776
Now, I got to fill the room
so I don't lose the month

119
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:42,078
and her friend comes
and stays there

120
00:06:42,111 --> 00:06:43,645
and gets high
the whole fucking time.

121
00:06:43,679 --> 00:06:45,014
Why didn't you just
kick the bitch out?

122
00:06:45,047 --> 00:06:46,148
Well, I had seven hoes

123
00:06:46,182 --> 00:06:48,317
and they're letting MS-13
deal drugs the whole time.

124
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:50,686
Lil, MS13 is a gang you
don't want to fuck with.

125
00:06:50,719 --> 00:06:52,755
You're good? You're good?
Okay. You need any coffee?

126
00:06:52,788 --> 00:06:54,356
All right. Sorry.
So, anyway.

127
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:56,926
Long story short.
I ended up hiding out in my room,

128
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:58,994
because these dudes were
straight fucking killers

129
00:06:59,028 --> 00:07:00,262
and I didn't wanna
fucking get killed

130
00:07:00,296 --> 00:07:02,064
so I played video games
the whole time.

131
00:07:02,098 --> 00:07:03,899
Remember the house
in Chatsworth?

132
00:07:03,933 --> 00:07:05,935
Mm-hmm.
- Well, this place was, like,

133
00:07:05,968 --> 00:07:07,937
maybe five times bigger.
Beautiful house.

134
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:09,071
I had a two-year lease

135
00:07:09,105 --> 00:07:10,940
with an option to buy it at
the end of the lease, right?

136
00:07:10,973 --> 00:07:14,410
Well... As usual,
shit got fucking crazy.

137
00:07:14,443 --> 00:07:16,879
I snapped, I got up in
one of those cholos' faces

138
00:07:16,912 --> 00:07:18,080
because I'm not
a little bitch.

139
00:07:18,114 --> 00:07:20,082
I came this fucking close
to getting shot.

140
00:07:20,116 --> 00:07:21,750
This fucking close.

141
00:07:21,784 --> 00:07:23,018
So then I had to crash
with Kennedy.

142
00:07:23,052 --> 00:07:25,653
You remember Kennedy?
Remember...

143
00:07:25,688 --> 00:07:27,022
Do you remember Kennedy?

144
00:07:27,056 --> 00:07:28,424
Anyway, I had to crash
at Kennedy's

145
00:07:28,457 --> 00:07:30,259
for, like, three weeks
until he kicked my ass out

146
00:07:30,292 --> 00:07:31,327
'cause someone left
his back door open

147
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,863
and his cute little cat
got out and got killed.

148
00:07:33,896 --> 00:07:35,097
And it wasn't me,

149
00:07:35,131 --> 00:07:35,898
it was some dumb cunt that
he fucked the night before.

150
00:07:35,931 --> 00:07:36,932
I'm sorry,
I don't mean to swear.

151
00:07:36,966 --> 00:07:39,168
But I don't do that,
everyone blames me, like,

152
00:07:39,201 --> 00:07:40,436
"Oh, Mikey's the bad guy."

153
00:07:40,469 --> 00:07:41,871
It's, like, whatever,
it's bullshit.

154
00:07:41,904 --> 00:07:44,006
So, anyway,
I had to crash at his place.

155
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:45,141
He kicks me out,

156
00:07:45,174 --> 00:07:47,409
for, like, three nights,
I slept on the fucking street,

157
00:07:47,443 --> 00:07:48,677
I slept in a alleyway.

158
00:07:48,711 --> 00:07:50,346
I used my shoes
as a goddamn pillow.

159
00:07:50,379 --> 00:07:52,882
It's fucking bullshit,
my neck was so sore,

160
00:07:52,915 --> 00:07:55,351
I got beat up,
that's how all this happened.

161
00:07:55,384 --> 00:07:57,419
Two homeless fuckers
beat the shit out of me.

162
00:07:57,453 --> 00:07:59,421
They took everything except
my phone and my wallet.

163
00:07:59,455 --> 00:08:00,890
And the only reason
they didn't get that

164
00:08:00,923 --> 00:08:03,392
is the cop showed up
and arrested my ass!

165
00:08:03,425 --> 00:08:05,027
Why'd you get arrested?

166
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,129
I have a feelin' there's a
whole lot more to this story.

167
00:08:07,163 --> 00:08:08,164
I'm sure there is.

168
00:08:08,197 --> 00:08:10,466
It doesn't even matter.
Look, guys.

169
00:08:10,499 --> 00:08:12,168
This could be fun,
this could be cool.

170
00:08:12,201 --> 00:08:14,136
I got a plan.
While I was on the bus,

171
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:16,238
I thought about this,
I gave it some serious thought.

172
00:08:16,272 --> 00:08:18,174
Lil, you know I'm not a
freeloader, right?

173
00:08:18,207 --> 00:08:19,842
- While I'm here...
- How long?

174
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:20,910
"How long" what?

175
00:08:20,943 --> 00:08:22,778
How long do you plan
on staying?

176
00:08:22,811 --> 00:08:24,346
Well, I mean, that's up to
you, and Lexi of course,

177
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,182
but look, I saw some
hiring signs on the way in.

178
00:08:26,215 --> 00:08:27,249
I'll go downtown tomorrow,

179
00:08:27,283 --> 00:08:28,951
and I'll get a job
that pays cash.

180
00:08:28,984 --> 00:08:30,352
I'll teach fucking karate
if I have to.

181
00:08:30,386 --> 00:08:31,420
I just got my green belt.

182
00:08:31,453 --> 00:08:33,889
I'll make cash and I'll
help out around here.

183
00:08:33,923 --> 00:08:35,491
You need a man
around the house. Okay?

184
00:08:35,524 --> 00:08:36,992
I already see
shit's falling apart,

185
00:08:37,026 --> 00:08:38,994
I can help out
with all that shit, right?

186
00:08:39,028 --> 00:08:42,464
I want at least $200 a week.

187
00:08:42,498 --> 00:08:44,366
Thank you, Lil,
you're not going to regret this.

188
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,303
Seriously, thank you so much
for trusting me... I'll...

189
00:08:47,336 --> 00:08:50,206
Let's give it a couple
of days and see how it goes.

190
00:08:50,239 --> 00:08:51,373
Yeah, whatever
you're comfortable with.

191
00:08:51,407 --> 00:08:53,242
I don't want
to make you uncomfortable,

192
00:08:53,275 --> 00:08:55,411
I'm here to help.
And look, before long,

193
00:08:55,444 --> 00:08:57,246
it'll be
like we're still married.

194
00:08:58,214 --> 00:09:00,049
We are still married.

195
00:09:02,985 --> 00:09:05,187
Oh, my God,
the backyard's a mess.

196
00:09:05,221 --> 00:09:07,990
See, you need a guy around...
Dude, there's a dragonfly.

197
00:09:11,527 --> 00:09:13,295
<i>...find
out, when she called you...</i>

198
00:09:13,329 --> 00:09:14,463
<i>Now, you traveled?</i>

199
00:09:14,496 --> 00:09:16,165
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- <i>How many days later?</i>

200
00:09:16,198 --> 00:09:17,967
<i>Okay.</i>

201
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,001
<i>This was
about three days.</i>

202
00:09:19,034 --> 00:09:20,035
<i>So,
she called you and said</i>

203
00:09:20,069 --> 00:09:21,237
<i>they were
in a high speed chase...</i>

204
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:21,937
<i>She said
I was in a high speed chase,</i>

205
00:09:21,971 --> 00:09:24,506
- <i>with Dante...</i>
- Mornin'.

206
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,408
- Mornin'.
- <i>She was chasing him.</i>

207
00:09:26,442 --> 00:09:29,345
<i>He was in the car,
she pulled up,</i>

208
00:09:29,378 --> 00:09:31,313
- <i>somebody told her...</i>
- I love this show.

209
00:09:32,514 --> 00:09:35,117
I watch it everyday,
so get used to it.

210
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:36,819
<i>And from what I was told,</i>

211
00:09:36,852 --> 00:09:39,021
<i>they were doing like 80.</i>

212
00:09:39,054 --> 00:09:41,223
<i>Down a main street.</i>

213
00:09:41,257 --> 00:09:44,093
<i>She's trying to catch him,
and he hit a pole.</i>

214
00:09:44,126 --> 00:09:45,361
<i>A fence pole.</i>

215
00:09:45,394 --> 00:09:47,129
<i>What do
you say happened?</i>

216
00:09:47,162 --> 00:09:48,564
<i>I was coming back
from the airport,</i>

217
00:09:48,597 --> 00:09:50,366
<i>driving her off as she stated.</i>

218
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,568
<i>And when I was
at the stop sign,</i>

219
00:09:52,601 --> 00:09:55,271
- <i>I had the right of way to...</i>
- Excuse me.

220
00:09:56,572 --> 00:09:59,842
<i>They ran the stop sign
and t-boned the car almost.</i>

221
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:02,311
<i>Was this your baby
mother in the other car?</i>

222
00:10:02,344 --> 00:10:03,912
- <i>No.</i>
- <i>When she calls you</i>

223
00:10:03,946 --> 00:10:05,047
<i>and she tells you,</i>

224
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,382
<i>'cause I believe
that conversation happened,</i>

225
00:10:06,415 --> 00:10:07,751
- <i>do you call him?</i>
- <i>Yes.</i>

226
00:10:07,783 --> 00:10:09,918
- <i>And what does he say?</i>
- <i>He like, "Man...</i>

227
00:10:09,952 --> 00:10:13,122
<i>"You know that crazy broad.
It's not my fault.</i>

228
00:10:13,155 --> 00:10:15,190
<i>"She crazy... I was tryna..."</i>

229
00:10:15,224 --> 00:10:18,060
<i>He was in fear for his
safety is what he told me.</i>

230
00:10:18,093 --> 00:10:19,194
<i>Is that
what you said?</i>

231
00:10:19,228 --> 00:10:21,597
- <i>No.</i>
- <i>I don't believe you.</i>

232
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:24,199
<i>Sir, you have a $500
counterclaim</i>

233
00:10:24,233 --> 00:10:25,267
<i>for emotional distress.</i>

234
00:10:25,301 --> 00:10:27,069
<i>I cannot wait to hear this.</i>

235
00:10:27,102 --> 00:10:29,104
Hey, Lil,
I'm going to borrow

236
00:10:29,138 --> 00:10:30,539
some of your ground beef,
okay?

237
00:10:30,572 --> 00:10:31,840
Okay.

238
00:10:36,045 --> 00:10:37,880
Hey, Lexi?

239
00:10:37,913 --> 00:10:39,148
Hello?

240
00:10:39,181 --> 00:10:40,282
- Yeah?
- Hey.

241
00:10:40,316 --> 00:10:42,084
Uh, I'm not looking
too presentable,

242
00:10:42,117 --> 00:10:43,319
so I'm going to let this
thing go down

243
00:10:43,352 --> 00:10:45,120
before I go
on these interviews.

244
00:10:45,154 --> 00:10:47,122
So, few more days, okay?

245
00:10:48,324 --> 00:10:50,059
All right?

246
00:10:50,092 --> 00:10:51,894
- Sure.
- Thank you.

247
00:10:51,927 --> 00:10:53,062
<i>It was, before she started</i>

248
00:10:53,095 --> 00:10:55,297
- <i>getting into my business.</i>
- <i>Really?</i>

249
00:10:55,331 --> 00:10:56,632
<i>So, that's what your
counter claim is about?</i>

250
00:10:56,665 --> 00:10:58,567
<i>She has caused
you emotional distress.</i>

251
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,069
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>
- <i>Not baby mom...</i>

252
00:11:00,102 --> 00:11:02,404
Put some clothes on
for Christ's sake.

253
00:11:02,438 --> 00:11:04,540
- <i>All of them do.</i>
- <i>Okay.</i>

254
00:11:04,573 --> 00:11:06,075
<i>They all run together.</i>

255
00:11:07,609 --> 00:11:09,445
<i>Your counterclaim
is dismissed, sir.</i>

256
00:11:09,478 --> 00:11:12,614
<i>Judgment in this case
is for the plaintiff $2902.</i>

257
00:11:17,653 --> 00:11:19,555
Not even one men's shirt?

258
00:11:19,588 --> 00:11:22,257
Beggars can't be
choosers, Mikey.

259
00:11:54,523 --> 00:11:57,426
Your last job listed

260
00:11:57,459 --> 00:11:59,328
is over 17 years ago.

261
00:11:59,361 --> 00:12:02,164
That's quite a gap
in employment.

262
00:12:02,197 --> 00:12:04,066
Well, you know,
I've worked almost everyday

263
00:12:04,099 --> 00:12:05,367
for the last 17 years.

264
00:12:05,401 --> 00:12:07,236
It's just I've been
self-employed.

265
00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:09,037
- What line of work?
- Oh, mostly entertainment.

266
00:12:09,071 --> 00:12:10,172
I've been living
in Los Angeles,

267
00:12:10,205 --> 00:12:12,241
that's why I have the 323
area code right there,

268
00:12:12,274 --> 00:12:14,076
in case you were wondering.
But, yeah.

269
00:12:14,109 --> 00:12:16,679
Film, television,
music, entrepreneurship.

270
00:12:16,713 --> 00:12:19,114
Okay, so why are you
interested in working here?

271
00:12:19,148 --> 00:12:20,616
- Well, I'm living here now.
- Okay.

272
00:12:20,649 --> 00:12:22,685
We were estranged for a
while, I'll be honest.

273
00:12:22,719 --> 00:12:24,219
But, you know,
we're both from here.

274
00:12:24,253 --> 00:12:26,522
And, you know, now that
we're back living here,

275
00:12:26,555 --> 00:12:29,324
we decided
to make a run of it.

276
00:12:29,358 --> 00:12:31,160
Well, we do require
some experience

277
00:12:31,193 --> 00:12:33,262
or some previous training
in the service industry.

278
00:12:33,295 --> 00:12:35,564
- Mm.
- And at least one reference.

279
00:12:35,597 --> 00:12:38,534
Uh, yeah.
That's going to be tricky.

280
00:12:38,567 --> 00:12:41,503
But I did work for
CiCi's Pizza from '99 and 2000.

281
00:12:41,537 --> 00:12:43,372
I think that branch
that I worked for closed.

282
00:12:43,405 --> 00:12:44,440
I put it on there.

283
00:12:44,473 --> 00:12:47,443
But, yeah, you could contact
corporate if you like.

284
00:12:47,476 --> 00:12:49,445
Look, if you were
incarcerated, that's okay.

285
00:12:49,478 --> 00:12:50,646
I just need something

286
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,714
from your parole officer.

287
00:12:51,748 --> 00:12:53,081
<i>All right, look,</i>

288
00:12:53,115 --> 00:12:54,416
I'm going to be straight
with you, all right?

289
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:55,584
All right. Tell me.
I need that.

290
00:12:55,617 --> 00:12:58,120
Okay. All right, look,
I'll just be honest with you, man.

291
00:12:58,153 --> 00:12:59,756
You don't recognize me,
do you?

292
00:12:59,789 --> 00:13:01,724
I'm an adult film actor.

293
00:13:02,524 --> 00:13:03,592
Excuse me?

294
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:06,094
A porn star.
I'm a porn star.

295
00:13:09,264 --> 00:13:10,432
I know, I've been working

296
00:13:10,466 --> 00:13:11,533
in the adult entertainment
industry

297
00:13:11,567 --> 00:13:13,469
since 2001 and, you know,
even though...

298
00:13:13,502 --> 00:13:15,003
Did you say porn?

299
00:13:15,037 --> 00:13:17,139
Hey, you know,
it was fun, I think.

300
00:13:17,172 --> 00:13:19,007
- I'm sure it was.
- Yeah, all the ladies...

301
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:20,309
Why don't you
just google me?

302
00:13:20,342 --> 00:13:22,110
Look up "Mikey Saber."

303
00:13:22,144 --> 00:13:24,079
- Mikey...
- Saber.

304
00:13:24,112 --> 00:13:28,183
S-A-B-E-R XXX. Go ahead.
Search it.

305
00:13:28,217 --> 00:13:29,251
This is unbelievable.

306
00:13:29,284 --> 00:13:31,620
Yeah,
that's what they say.

307
00:13:31,653 --> 00:13:33,155
Yeah,
just pull down... Yep.

308
00:13:33,188 --> 00:13:35,224
That's me right there,
younger me, but...

309
00:13:37,092 --> 00:13:39,762
- Oh, that certainly is you.
- Mm. Yeah.

310

2,000 movies, six awards,

311
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:44,199
13 nominations
and Hall of Fame, did that.

312
00:13:44,233 --> 00:13:45,702
I want to, you know,
start fresh,

313
00:13:45,735 --> 00:13:48,637
and really start
a new chapter, a new life

314
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:50,606
with you,
and your company, ma'am.

315
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:51,741
I'd really
like to help you,

316
00:13:51,774 --> 00:13:55,477
but, um, my management,
they would not permit this.

317
00:13:55,511 --> 00:13:59,548
I'm sorry,
but you're just simply

318
00:13:59,581 --> 00:14:02,351
overqualified for this job.

319
00:14:02,384 --> 00:14:04,219
I'm just not sure
our customers

320
00:14:04,253 --> 00:14:08,390
would be comfortable
with you waiting on them.

321
00:14:08,423 --> 00:14:11,260
They may have seen
one of your movies.

322
00:14:11,293 --> 00:14:12,561
Later on,
when you get home,

323
00:14:12,594 --> 00:14:14,630
google "Mikey Saber XXX"

324
00:14:14,663 --> 00:14:15,732
and you'll see
what I'm talking about.

325
00:14:15,765 --> 00:14:16,665
- It's some good shit.
- Okay.

326
00:14:16,699 --> 00:14:18,200
- Yeah, yeah I'll do that.
- Thanks, man.

327
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:19,334
- Thanks, man. Take care now.
- Okay.

00:16:31,266 --> 00:16:33,736
Mikey? Oh.

360

- Yeah, she's out in the back.
- Okay.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

Thanks, big dog.

00:17:02,531 --> 00:17:04,466
Don't worry about it,
you know the boy is slow.

371
00:17:04,499 --> 00:17:06,869
That's why his head is so big.
Don't talk about the boy.

372
00:17:06,903 --> 00:17:07,937
I don't need him.

373
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:09,271
I'm just tellin' you
to calm down,

374
00:17:09,304 --> 00:17:10,372
I'm gonna check his ass.

375

Remember me?

00:17:19,514 --> 00:17:21,316
It's okay,
it's been forever.

Lil's son in law. Mikey.

381

Mikey...

382
00:17:26,321 --> 00:17:27,589
Yeah, it's good
to see you, ma'am.

383
00:17:27,622 --> 00:17:29,524
What the hell are you
doing around here?

384
00:17:29,558 --> 00:17:31,259
Yeah, I'm back in town.

385
00:17:31,293 --> 00:17:33,963
It's so good to see you
again, ma'am, you look great.

- Hey, I'm Mikey.
- My daughter, June.

387
00:17:37,499 --> 00:17:38,768
Uh...

388
00:17:38,801 --> 00:17:40,435
Oh, shit, June.

389
00:17:40,469 --> 00:17:41,670
I haven't seen you since...

390
00:17:41,704 --> 00:17:43,538
Last time I saw you,
you were up to my knee.

391
00:17:43,572 --> 00:17:44,874
You've grown up.

392
00:17:44,907 --> 00:17:46,241
Big girl now.

393
00:17:49,344 --> 00:17:51,379
So, why you back,
Mr. Hollywood?

394
00:17:51,413 --> 00:17:53,482
Oh, uh...

395
00:17:53,515 --> 00:17:56,886
Well, me and the ol' lady
trying to give it another go.

396
00:17:56,919 --> 00:17:57,954
Oh, really?

397
00:17:57,987 --> 00:18:00,990
So you're telling me Lil
is letting you stay there?

398
00:18:01,023 --> 00:18:04,359
Well, yeah, yeah.
I mean, you know, I'm helping out,

399
00:18:04,392 --> 00:18:06,696
and chipping in
around the house.

400
00:18:06,729 --> 00:18:07,797
Which is why I'm here.

401
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:09,431
So, I was wondering

402
00:18:09,464 --> 00:18:12,601
if maybe I could move
some bud for you?

403
00:18:12,634 --> 00:18:14,369
Like I did back in the day.

404
00:18:15,004 --> 00:18:16,005
Hmm...

405
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,508
Speaking of
back in the day,

406
00:18:20,442 --> 00:18:22,511
you sound brand new.

407
00:18:22,544 --> 00:18:24,513
Oh, the accent?
Yeah...

408
00:18:24,546 --> 00:18:27,784
Yeah, I had to lose it
for the biz, ma'am.

409
00:18:27,817 --> 00:18:29,786
But y'all know I'm still
a Texas boy at heart.

410
00:18:29,819 --> 00:18:31,921
Mm-hmm.
You helpin' Lil with the rent?

411
00:18:31,954 --> 00:18:33,388
Of course!

412
00:18:33,421 --> 00:18:34,523
But, uh...

413
00:18:34,556 --> 00:18:35,892
I'm kinda cash poor
at the moment,

414
00:18:35,925 --> 00:18:37,927
do you think you could
put me on Front Street?

415
00:18:41,931 --> 00:18:43,065
Let's start
with an ounce.

416
00:18:43,099 --> 00:18:44,666
Yeah, that'd be great.

417
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,736
- Thank you.
- Hey, June. Hey, Le.

418
00:18:46,769 --> 00:18:47,837
Hey darlin'.
How are you?

419
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:49,638
- I'm good, how are you?
- Good, good, good.

420
00:18:49,671 --> 00:18:51,707
- Good, good, good.
- Everything is fine.

421
00:18:51,741 --> 00:18:54,076
You're looking good.
I know. You're looking good.

422
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:55,878
You ladies have a nice day.

423
00:18:55,912 --> 00:18:57,612
You, too, Mikey.

424
00:18:57,646 --> 00:18:59,015
All right, girl...
Anyways, girl, so...

425
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:03,052
Yeah, so, I kinda changed the...
Yeah.

426
00:19:03,085 --> 00:19:04,619
- I like the color.
- Girl, thank you.

427
00:19:04,653 --> 00:19:06,388
Yeah, what color is that?

428
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:10,659
I bet you
any goddamn money,

429

smoke that shit himself.

Well, I'm glad I gave
him some Reggie Bush.

431
00:19:14,964 --> 00:19:16,498
That's what
I'm talking about.

00:21:06,842 --> 00:21:08,744
You think this is
a good color on me?

467
00:21:08,778 --> 00:21:10,112
Oh, absolutely.

468
00:21:10,146 --> 00:21:11,280
Let me get that.

469
00:21:11,314 --> 00:21:13,716
You have a fitting room?
Or do I just have to risk it?

470
00:21:13,749 --> 00:21:16,484
Yeah I think this shirt will
look real nice on you, hon.

471
00:21:19,554 --> 00:21:22,058
If I buy all those clothes,
throw this in for a dollar.

472
00:21:22,091 --> 00:21:23,125
- All right. Deal.
- Okay?

473
00:21:23,159 --> 00:21:24,193
Deal.

474
00:21:24,226 --> 00:21:25,627
- Sold.
- Sold.

475
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:26,494
Sold!

476
00:21:27,964 --> 00:21:30,565
Lil, as a token
of my appreciation,

477
00:21:30,598 --> 00:21:33,002
step up from
your restaurant ashtray,

478
00:21:33,035 --> 00:21:34,669
and okay...

479
00:21:34,704 --> 00:21:37,639
This doesn't change anything,
but I do like it.

480
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:58,694
Damn, dope ride.

481
00:21:58,728 --> 00:22:01,230
Uh, yeah, man.
Can I help you?

482
00:22:02,098 --> 00:22:03,265
Wow.

483
00:22:03,299 --> 00:22:04,967
I'm next door.
I'm living next door.

484
00:22:06,335 --> 00:22:08,270
Oh, yeah?
Wait a second.

485
00:22:10,172 --> 00:22:12,274
Shit, you're Mikey!

486
00:22:12,775 --> 00:22:13,809
Yeah.

487
00:22:13,843 --> 00:22:14,944
Yeah, man, it's...

488
00:22:14,977 --> 00:22:16,544
It's me, man.
It's me, Lonnie!

489
00:22:17,179 --> 00:22:18,314
Do I know you?

490
00:22:18,347 --> 00:22:21,649
Well, I mean, kinda.

491
00:22:21,684 --> 00:22:24,086
I mean, I live here,
obviously.

492
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,587
And, uh...

493
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:27,123
No, Lexi, man.

494
00:22:27,156 --> 00:22:28,958
Lexi used to babysit me
all the time.

495
00:22:28,991 --> 00:22:30,826
Oh, yeah.

496
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:32,560
Yeah, my parents came home
one night,

497
00:22:32,594 --> 00:22:34,230
y'all were humpin'
in their bedroom.

498
00:22:34,263 --> 00:22:36,298
You jumped
out the window naked!

499
00:22:36,332 --> 00:22:38,200
They called the cops
on you and everything.

500
00:22:38,234 --> 00:22:39,835
Yep, yep, now I remember.

501
00:22:39,869 --> 00:22:42,004
Oh, shit, your mother
hates me.

502
00:22:42,038 --> 00:22:42,938
Uh, well, I mean,

503
00:22:42,972 --> 00:22:45,741
she hated you, man.
Uh, yeah, she died.

504
00:22:45,775 --> 00:22:47,777
Oh. Damn,
sorry to hear that.

505
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:48,978
No, I mean, it's good, man.

506
00:22:49,011 --> 00:22:50,880
I mean,
it happened over a year ago.

507
00:22:50,913 --> 00:22:52,214
Bladder cancer.

508
00:22:52,248 --> 00:22:54,083
- Shit's a motherfucker.
- Ah, shit.

509
00:22:54,116 --> 00:22:55,851
That sucks.

510
00:22:55,885 --> 00:22:57,585
Hey, we should hang out
sometime.

511
00:22:57,619 --> 00:22:59,021
Take a spin in this bad boy.

512
00:22:59,055 --> 00:23:00,089
Uh, yeah, man.

513
00:23:00,122 --> 00:23:01,589
What are you even
doing back here?

514
00:23:01,623 --> 00:23:02,925
Oh, it's a long story,

515
00:23:02,958 --> 00:23:04,360
but do you think you could
take me downtown tomorrow?

516
00:23:04,393 --> 00:23:05,593
We could catch up.

517
00:23:05,627 --> 00:23:08,230
Yeah, dude. I would love to.
I got nothin' else to do.

518
00:23:08,264 --> 00:23:10,099
Hell, yeah.
Thanks, bro. Uh...

519
00:23:10,132 --> 00:23:12,034
Hey, let's just get you
some shoes on this bitch.

520
00:23:12,068 --> 00:23:13,202
You're good to go.

521
00:23:13,235 --> 00:23:15,237
- Yeah, man. I can't wait.
- All right.

522
00:23:15,271 --> 00:23:17,173
And welcome back, dude!

523
00:23:17,206 --> 00:23:19,075
Fuckin' Mikey, man. Shit.

524
00:23:21,744 --> 00:23:22,745
Fuckin' Mikey.

525
00:23:36,959 --> 00:23:39,829
Oh, you got to be
fucking kidding me.

526
00:23:42,431 --> 00:23:45,101
Hey, great life choice,
guys, seriously.

527
00:23:49,738 --> 00:23:50,806
So stupid.

528
00:23:57,246 --> 00:23:58,347
Her doctor cut

529
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:00,950
her pain meds in half,
you fucking asshole.

530
00:24:00,983 --> 00:24:02,051
Yeah, right.

531
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:05,221
Oh,
this is a pimp mobile

532
00:24:05,254 --> 00:24:07,022
if I ever rode in one, Lonnie.

533
00:24:07,056 --> 00:24:08,757
Man, I'm not gonna
lie to you, Mikey,

534
00:24:08,791 --> 00:24:11,694
I never thought I'd see you
back in Texas City, brother.

535
00:24:11,727 --> 00:24:13,863
Yeah, me neither.

536
00:24:13,896 --> 00:24:16,398
God, I remember
when y'all left, man.

537
00:24:16,432 --> 00:24:18,901
You all were like celebrities,
you know?

538
00:24:18,934 --> 00:24:21,137
Fuckin' two porn stars,
the couple. Oh!

539
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:22,304
Yeah? That's cool.

540
00:24:22,338 --> 00:24:25,908
Oh, dude, they used to
show Lexi's fuckin' videos

541
00:24:25,941 --> 00:24:28,177
at every one
of the high school parties.

542
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:30,112
And I got to brag, man,

543
00:24:30,146 --> 00:24:31,780
because
she was my neighbor.

544
00:24:31,814 --> 00:24:33,149
And babysitter.

545
00:24:33,182 --> 00:24:35,317
Yeah, man.
And babysitter, man.

546
00:24:35,351 --> 00:24:36,252
Look, man,
I've got 800,

547
00:24:36,285 --> 00:24:38,454
almost 900 subscribers
on my Pornhub channel.

548
00:24:38,487 --> 00:24:40,823
And I got
one of the highest ratings.

549
00:24:40,856 --> 00:24:43,459
That's not just male talent,
that's overall.

550
00:24:43,492 --> 00:24:45,694
I've got
an 81% positive click rate.

551
00:24:45,728 --> 00:24:47,897
I was at this coffee shop in the
Valley, and these people were like,

552
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:49,165
"Oh, shit,
that's Mikey Saber."

553
00:24:49,198 --> 00:24:50,699
Right here, bro.
Go right, right, right.

554
00:24:53,035 --> 00:24:55,004
Yeah, bro,
they recognized me.

555
00:24:55,037 --> 00:24:56,305
They're like, "Oh,
that's Mikey Saber.

556
00:24:56,338 --> 00:24:58,407
They took a picture of me,
tagged me on Instagram.

557
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,242
And next thing you know,
I had 100 new followers.

558
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:03,212
- 100 followers?
- Yep.

559
00:25:03,245 --> 00:25:05,247
I don't even have
100 followers.

560
00:25:05,281 --> 00:25:06,415
Well,
if you stick with me,

561
00:25:06,448 --> 00:25:08,217
I'll get
your followers up, baby.

562
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:10,119
Jenna Haze, man...

563
00:25:10,152 --> 00:25:11,387
- Huh?
- Jenna Haze, man...

564
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:12,454
Oh, yeah, Jenna.

565
00:25:12,488 --> 00:25:14,857
Yeah, I did at least
three scenes with her, man.

566
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:17,826
She's a nasty bitch,
let me tell you.

567
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,495
<i>Make it rain on that ass</i>

568
00:25:19,528 --> 00:25:21,897
<i>if you want to see
that cash, right here.</i>

569
00:25:21,931 --> 00:25:24,033
<i>Oh, yeah, if you'd like to see
what's in between,</i>

570
00:25:24,066 --> 00:25:25,768
<i>come on and throw some
more green right here.</i>

571
00:25:25,801 --> 00:25:26,669
<i>All night long.</i>

572
00:25:26,702 --> 00:25:29,205
She ran my bill
up to $1500 bucks.

573
00:25:29,238 --> 00:25:31,173
It's like,
who you callin' in Prague, bitch?

574
00:25:31,207 --> 00:25:32,308
Fuck, if I know!

575
00:25:32,341 --> 00:25:35,477
Shit, yeah.
But she's a beautiful girl, man!

576
00:25:35,511 --> 00:25:36,879
- I can't hear you.
- I said,

577
00:25:36,912 --> 00:25:38,480
"Yeah, but she's
a beautiful girl, man."

578
00:25:38,514 --> 00:25:41,150
Oh, yeah, she's fuckin'
bangin', bro! She's bangin'.

579
00:25:42,117 --> 00:25:44,386
Oh, God,
speaking of bangin'.

580
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:46,388
I need a minute.

581
00:25:51,227 --> 00:25:54,029
<i>Throw that green
right there for Diamond, guys.</i>

582
00:25:55,864 --> 00:25:57,132
<i>If you love pussy, well, hey,</i>

583
00:25:57,166 --> 00:25:59,969
<i>don't be shy to get topside,
right here, right now.</i>

584
00:26:04,807 --> 00:26:07,209
Tell your girls there's
more where that came from.

585
00:26:13,382 --> 00:26:14,383
Mm.

586
00:26:16,518 --> 00:26:18,053
<i>...who you trust</i>

587
00:26:18,087 --> 00:26:19,455

588
00:26:19,488 --> 00:26:22,358
<i>and to stay faithful

589
00:26:33,369 --> 00:26:34,370
Psst!

590
00:26:36,038 --> 00:26:37,139
- Hey!
- Hey.

591
00:26:37,172 --> 00:26:38,374
Whatcha doing?

592
00:26:38,407 --> 00:26:40,542
- I'm watching TV.
- Oh.

593
00:26:40,576 --> 00:26:42,411
No way.
What are you watching?

594
00:26:42,444 --> 00:26:44,246
None of your business.

595
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,348
- I love that show.
- Oh, my God.

596
00:26:47,082 --> 00:26:48,550
Hey, you, uh...

597
00:26:49,952 --> 00:26:51,253
You wanna hang out
and stuff?

598
00:26:52,354 --> 00:26:54,056
Do I want to hang out
and stuff?

599
00:26:54,089 --> 00:26:55,090
Yeah.

600
00:26:56,091 --> 00:26:57,126
What?

601
00:26:57,159 --> 00:26:58,160
Do you want to hook up?

602
00:26:59,528 --> 00:27:01,096
Do I want to hook up?

603
00:27:02,631 --> 00:27:04,466
Do... Do you want to fuck?

604
00:27:07,903 --> 00:27:09,271
Are you serious
right now, Mikey?

605
00:27:09,305 --> 00:27:11,573
Yeah, I'm serious,
keep it down, your mom...

606
00:27:13,609 --> 00:27:16,812
- Come on.
- Okay, hurry.

607
00:27:18,314 --> 00:27:19,315
Phew.

608
00:27:26,188 --> 00:27:29,558
<i>...and no scratches. Look!
Burnt cheese...</i>

609
00:27:33,529 --> 00:27:34,563
Can I get a drag?

610
00:27:35,397 --> 00:27:36,398
- Can I get...
- Yeah.

611
00:27:37,166 --> 00:27:38,534
Mm!

612
00:27:38,567 --> 00:27:40,135
Your body looks good.

613
00:27:40,169 --> 00:27:42,137
You been working out?

614
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:45,607
- What?
- So...

615
00:27:47,109 --> 00:27:48,243
We're done here.

616
00:27:48,944 --> 00:27:49,978
What do you mean?

617
00:27:50,012 --> 00:27:51,313
What? I can't sleep here?

618
00:27:51,347 --> 00:27:52,381
No.

619
00:27:52,414 --> 00:27:54,983
- Really?
- Go back to the sofa.

620
00:27:55,017 --> 00:27:57,019
Come on now.

621
00:27:57,052 --> 00:27:58,987
Jesus. Oh, my God.

622
00:28:21,043 --> 00:28:22,044
That was fun.

623
00:28:29,184 --> 00:28:31,220
Sophie, I fucked your mom
last night.

624
00:28:31,253 --> 00:28:33,055
Oh, my God,
can you keep it down?

625
00:28:33,088 --> 00:28:34,356
- Oh, stop.
- Shut your...

626
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:35,457
You love it.

627
00:28:37,393 --> 00:28:39,528
Don't think this is going
to become a regular thing.

628
00:28:46,068 --> 00:28:47,536
Think you can
cut the lawn today?

629
00:29:20,269 --> 00:29:22,604
That's right, I'm
back, I'm back in town,

630
00:29:22,638 --> 00:29:23,672
you've seen me before.

631
00:29:23,706 --> 00:29:24,741
Don't act
like you ain't seen me,

632
00:29:24,774 --> 00:29:26,175
she recognized me.

633
00:29:28,043 --> 00:29:29,511
You know, uh,
in high school,

634
00:29:29,545 --> 00:29:30,680
I beat this guy's ass

635
00:29:30,713 --> 00:29:32,414
- like 25 years ago.
- No way.

636
00:29:32,448 --> 00:29:34,416
We had a misunderstanding
on the basketball court

637
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:36,585
over a basketball game.

638
00:29:36,618 --> 00:29:39,087
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you</i>

639
00:29:39,121 --> 00:29:41,724
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you!
Happy... ♪</i>

640
00:29:41,758 --> 00:29:43,125
<i>And to many more!</i>

641
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,696
Mom, we just want to say
happy birthday.

642
00:29:46,729 --> 00:29:50,132
And we hope you have many more.

643
00:29:51,066 --> 00:29:52,634
Thank you, honey!

644
00:29:52,668 --> 00:29:55,270
- Yeah.
- This one.

645
00:29:55,304 --> 00:29:58,207
I guess you can set it down,
thank you all for comin' out!

646
00:30:19,729 --> 00:30:21,263
- Zena. Zena Valentine.
- Yeah.

647
00:30:21,296 --> 00:30:23,265
Zena. Melissa. Yeah.

648
00:30:23,298 --> 00:30:25,200
Yeah, man, you were
in a bunch of her scenes.

649
00:30:25,234 --> 00:30:27,369
Uh, she was in a bunch
of my scenes, technically.

650
00:30:27,402 --> 00:30:29,505
But yeah,
that was my girl after Lexi.

651
00:30:29,538 --> 00:30:30,472
Bitch goes and marries

652
00:30:30,506 --> 00:30:33,041
some rich software dork
she met in Vegas.

653
00:30:33,075 --> 00:30:33,910
I think they have a kid,

654
00:30:33,943 --> 00:30:35,812
they live in Salt Lake
or something.

655
00:30:35,845 --> 00:30:37,546
Boring fucking life.

656
00:30:37,579 --> 00:30:39,047
- Wow, man...
- Yeah.

657
00:30:39,081 --> 00:30:40,282
Who do you think
discovered her?

658
00:30:40,315 --> 00:30:41,383
I got her signed
to Renegade,

659
00:30:41,416 --> 00:30:42,651
I taught her the pole.

660
00:30:42,685 --> 00:30:43,786
I dealt with her crazy

661
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:46,756
drugged-out ass
for a year, man.

662
00:30:46,789 --> 00:30:49,157
As soon as the bitch's head
gets big, they betray you.

663
00:30:50,392 --> 00:30:52,127
That's what happened
with Lexi, you know?

664
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,662
- Really? Lexi?
- Yep.

665
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:56,265
Jules Jordan bought her out
from under me for 10 grand

666
00:30:56,298 --> 00:30:58,467
the first chance he got,
that fucker.

667
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,302
Wait, he bought her?

668
00:31:00,335 --> 00:31:01,670
Yeah, he paid her
10 grand to betray me,

669
00:31:01,704 --> 00:31:03,338
but the joke's
on Jules, though.

670
00:31:03,372 --> 00:31:05,340
She went from doing roxies
to smokin' tar

671
00:31:05,374 --> 00:31:07,810
the minute I wasn't there
to straighten her ass out.

672
00:31:07,844 --> 00:31:09,712
We were together
for five years.

673
00:31:09,746 --> 00:31:11,280
Five fuckin' years.

674
00:31:11,313 --> 00:31:13,315
She won two AVNs
under my watch.

675
00:31:13,348 --> 00:31:15,718
She leaves me,
bitch gets shot out in nine months,

676
00:31:15,752 --> 00:31:16,686
couldn't book shit.

677
00:31:16,719 --> 00:31:18,353
And then she goes,
and moves in with mommy

678
00:31:18,387 --> 00:31:21,423
exactly one year after
she left me high and dry.

679
00:31:21,456 --> 00:31:23,292
- Shit.
- Yeah, shit is right.

680
00:31:23,325 --> 00:31:25,327
Hey, is Whispers
in Galveston still open?

681
00:31:32,835 --> 00:31:35,170
You're not leaving that
dirty glass in the sink.

682
00:31:35,571 --> 00:31:37,673
- No, sir.
- Okay.

683
00:31:37,707 --> 00:31:38,741
Clean it up.

684
00:31:38,775 --> 00:31:39,842
Okay.

685
00:31:46,582 --> 00:31:48,685
That's right,
we all do our share.

686
00:31:48,718 --> 00:31:50,252
Mm-hmm. Okay.

687
00:31:50,285 --> 00:31:51,721
Wait. Where do you think
you're going?

688
00:31:51,754 --> 00:31:52,689
What about the others?

689
00:31:52,722 --> 00:31:53,723
- Those are yours, too.
- Lil, look. All right.

690
00:31:53,756 --> 00:31:56,158
The last three houses
I lived in had dishwashers,

691
00:31:56,191 --> 00:31:57,225
I'm not doing the dishes.

692
00:31:57,259 --> 00:31:58,761
- I don't do that shit, right?
- You do not live here.

693
00:31:58,795 --> 00:32:00,362
This is my kitchen.

694
00:32:00,395 --> 00:32:01,764
If you can't follow
the rules...

695
00:32:01,798 --> 00:32:03,700
- Out! Out! Out!
- Why are you talking to me

696
00:32:03,733 --> 00:32:05,133
- like a little kid.
- Hey, Lexi!

697
00:32:05,167 --> 00:32:06,736
Don't you disrespect
your mother-in-law!

698
00:32:06,769 --> 00:32:07,870
Your mom's starting shit
with me.

699
00:32:07,904 --> 00:32:10,138
Can you please inform her
I'm not a dick?

700
00:32:10,172 --> 00:32:11,406
Why would I lie
to my mother?

701
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,842
Oh, you, too, huh?
Really?

702
00:32:12,875 --> 00:32:14,610
You're just gonna turn on me like
that, after...

703
00:32:14,643 --> 00:32:15,678
I've been mowing
the fucking lawn.

704
00:32:15,712 --> 00:32:16,746
- Oh, my God.
- What?

705
00:32:16,779 --> 00:32:17,814
You've been
mowing the lawn.

706
00:32:17,847 --> 00:32:18,748
What? Yeah, I've been
mowing the lawn.

707
00:32:18,781 --> 00:32:20,148
- Jesus Christ, Mikey.
- You've been leaving

708
00:32:20,182 --> 00:32:21,283
dirty dishes in the sink.

709
00:32:21,316 --> 00:32:23,385
You haven't given me
a dime.

710
00:32:23,418 --> 00:32:24,821
I know, but I'm going
to pay you guys,

711
00:32:24,854 --> 00:32:25,855
but look,
I've been walkin' the dog.

712
00:32:25,888 --> 00:32:27,890
- I'm providing protection.
- She's an outside dog!

713
00:32:27,924 --> 00:32:28,925
She doesn't need walkin',
Mikey!

714
00:32:28,958 --> 00:32:30,192
I'm providing security.
I've been helpin' out.

715
00:32:30,225 --> 00:32:31,193
We don't need security.
Do we need a security guard, Mom?

716
00:32:31,226 --> 00:32:33,261
- Oh, come on.
- I didn't know that we hired

717
00:32:33,295 --> 00:32:34,396
a security guard.

718
00:32:34,429 --> 00:32:35,798
Yeah, you...
You're safe now because I'm here.

719
00:32:35,832 --> 00:32:37,199
You're always
on my couch.

720
00:32:37,232 --> 00:32:38,935
You've been drinking
all my Ensures.

721
00:32:38,968 --> 00:32:40,235
Listen, I'm trying
to get a job.

722
00:32:40,268 --> 00:32:41,938
You've been here
for three weeks now!

723
00:32:41,971 --> 00:32:43,171
I've been looking
for a job the whole time.

724
00:32:43,205 --> 00:32:43,906
- I want you out of here now.
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.

725
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:45,842
Wait, wait.
Listen, listen.

726
00:32:45,875 --> 00:32:46,776
I know I said I'd help out
with the rent.

727
00:32:46,809 --> 00:32:48,343
- You did. You did.
- No, wait a minute.

728
00:32:48,377 --> 00:32:49,544
Let me finish.

729
00:32:49,578 --> 00:32:50,880
I know I said
I'd help out with the rent.

730
00:32:50,913 --> 00:32:52,381
- Yeah.
- So...

731
00:32:52,414 --> 00:32:53,615
I'm not gonna
help out with the rent.

732
00:32:53,649 --> 00:32:55,350
Well, get
the fuck out, then!

733
00:32:55,384 --> 00:32:57,319
I'm gonna pay
the whole goddamn thing!

734
00:32:59,621 --> 00:33:01,323
- Now you're talkin'.
- Uh-huh.

735
00:33:01,356 --> 00:33:03,191
August is on Mikey,
motherfuckers!

736
00:33:03,225 --> 00:33:04,426
Yeah! Look
how your eyes light up

737
00:33:04,459 --> 00:33:05,627
like a little
Christmas tree.

738
00:33:05,661 --> 00:33:06,729
The whole month.
The whole month.

739
00:33:06,763 --> 00:33:07,697
- Yes, the whole month.
- Okay.

740
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:10,399
So let's go get some
fuckin' donuts, on me,

741
00:33:10,432 --> 00:33:12,234
'cause I take care of shit
around here.

742
00:33:12,267 --> 00:33:14,469
And whatever fuckin' donuts
you want, let's go.

743
00:33:14,503 --> 00:33:16,939
I just wanted to get you
guys taken care of, okay?

744
00:33:16,973 --> 00:33:18,808
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

745
00:33:18,841 --> 00:33:20,542
My favorite place.

746
00:33:20,575 --> 00:33:22,411
I know, Lil.
You love this place.

747
00:33:22,845 --> 00:33:23,980
Yes.

748
00:33:24,013 --> 00:33:25,982
I might have one bite.
I don't know, I'll see.

749
00:33:26,015 --> 00:33:27,684
You think it's too late
for me to get coffee?

750
00:33:27,717 --> 00:33:29,351
You can get coffee
whenever you want.

751
00:33:29,384 --> 00:33:30,485
I just don't think
it's gonna be

752
00:33:30,519 --> 00:33:31,888
the best coffee
in the world, but...

753
00:33:31,921 --> 00:33:34,691
Here, look. I even got
the door. I got the door.

754
00:33:34,724 --> 00:33:36,959
- I got the door.
- Thank you.

755
00:33:36,993 --> 00:33:38,326
- Here we are.
- Mom, come on.

756
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,661
- Good evenin'.
- Hello.

757
00:33:39,696 --> 00:33:41,430
- Hello.
- Whatever these ladies want.

758
00:33:41,463 --> 00:33:43,532
- Okay.
- I want donut holes,

759
00:33:43,565 --> 00:33:45,702
and jelly filled donut,
and a cappuccino.

760
00:33:45,735 --> 00:33:46,769
There you go,
make it a large.

761
00:33:46,803 --> 00:33:48,503
- Give her an extra-large cup.
- For here or to go?

762
00:33:48,537 --> 00:33:50,439
- What do you want, for here?
- Yeah.

763
00:33:50,472 --> 00:33:51,640
- Do you want it here?
- What do you think?

764
00:33:51,673 --> 00:33:52,709
We're just gonna go,

765
00:33:52,742 --> 00:33:53,642
we're gonna eat it
just on the road?

766
00:33:53,675 --> 00:33:56,578
Give her the largest
cappuccino that you got,

767
00:33:56,611 --> 00:33:58,280
- and whatever drink she wants.
- I'll have a small coffee.

768
00:33:58,313 --> 00:34:00,348
Give her a large. Get a...
Now's the time. Get a large.

769
00:34:00,382 --> 00:34:01,516
Yeah, I'll get
a large coffee, and...

770
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:02,952
- And...
- With lots of cream.

771
00:34:02,985 --> 00:34:04,721
- Sure.
- And a little bit of sugar.

772
00:34:04,754 --> 00:34:06,254
What other donuts
do you want?

773
00:34:06,288 --> 00:34:07,890
- Um, I wanna have...
- She wants a pink.

774
00:34:07,924 --> 00:34:09,726
I want a pink...
Yeah, pink sparkle, please.

775
00:34:09,759 --> 00:34:11,359
Give her the pink sparkles.
Whatever she wants.

776
00:34:11,393 --> 00:34:12,494
And then I can get...

777
00:34:12,527 --> 00:34:14,496
Ooh, can I get a chocolate, too?
Can I get a chocolate?

778
00:34:14,529 --> 00:34:16,531
- Thank you.
- Whatever they want. Okay?

779
00:34:16,565 --> 00:34:17,767
Donut holes, please.

780
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,868
Yeah,
get the donut holes.

781
00:34:18,901 --> 00:34:20,435
Yeah, this is the day
to get everything you want.

782
00:34:20,469 --> 00:34:22,504
This is the day
that the Lord hath made.

783
00:34:22,537 --> 00:34:24,006
- Mr. Moneybags here.
- Thank you.

784
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,908
- Okay.
- All right.

785
00:34:25,942 --> 00:34:27,710
Look at that, huh?
We got the holes, you're good.

786
00:34:27,744 --> 00:34:28,911
Is that enough
for you guys?

787
00:34:28,945 --> 00:34:30,612
You should get it while
we're here 'cause this is it.

788
00:34:30,645 --> 00:34:31,546
All right. There you go.
That's...

789
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:32,447
- Is that one yours?
- Is that the cappuccino?

790
00:34:32,481 --> 00:34:34,416
Okay, that's the cappuccino.
This one's...

791
00:34:34,449 --> 00:34:35,484
That's the biggest one
they got.

792
00:34:35,517 --> 00:34:37,652
I don't know what more you want me to do.
All right.

793
00:34:37,687 --> 00:34:38,755
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

794
00:34:38,788 --> 00:34:40,288
You guys go ahead
and sit down.

795
00:34:40,322 --> 00:34:41,590
I'll grab this.
How much is that?

796
00:34:41,623 --> 00:34:45,695
- $6:32.
- $6:32. All right.

797
00:34:46,863 --> 00:34:47,930
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm.

798
00:34:47,964 --> 00:34:49,598
Can I get some napkins,
please?

799
00:34:49,631 --> 00:34:51,366
- Thank you, yeah.
- All righty.

800
00:34:52,769 --> 00:34:55,437
And here's your change.

801
00:35:01,643 --> 00:35:03,012
Thank you, kindly.

802
00:35:09,919 --> 00:35:11,888
Mm. I'm going
to save the pink sprinkle,

803
00:35:11,921 --> 00:35:13,089
this one, for last.

804
00:35:13,122 --> 00:35:15,457
This one, I don't know
what to do with.

805
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:16,926
I don't know what to do
with that one.

806
00:35:16,959 --> 00:35:19,028
I don't know what to do
with that, Ma. Look.

807
00:35:19,061 --> 00:35:20,495
- All right, I'll have one.
- Don't you feel like it? Okay.

808
00:35:20,529 --> 00:35:21,630
- Just tear me half.
- Eat the part that doesn't

809
00:35:21,663 --> 00:35:22,564
- have the sprinkle on it.
- I don't want the colored one,

810
00:35:22,597 --> 00:35:24,633
just give me half of
one of the donut balls.

811
00:35:24,666 --> 00:35:26,102
- Half of a donut ball?
- Why do they call it a hole?

812
00:35:26,135 --> 00:35:28,004
I don't understand why
it's a hole if it's the...

813
00:35:28,037 --> 00:35:29,906
The hole is in the middle.

814
00:35:29,939 --> 00:35:31,908
That's where
it came out of.

815
00:35:31,941 --> 00:35:34,543
Right. Okay,
that makes sense.

816
00:35:34,576 --> 00:35:36,545
This one doesn't have
enough sprinkles on it.

817
00:35:36,578 --> 00:35:37,680
See that?

818
00:35:37,713 --> 00:35:38,748
What do you guys, uh...

819
00:35:38,781 --> 00:35:40,649
Can you guys wrap this up?
We got to get out of here.

820
00:35:40,683 --> 00:35:41,884
- Okay.
- Excuse me...

821
00:35:41,918 --> 00:35:43,152
What... No, Mom.
I am eating.

822
00:35:43,186 --> 00:35:47,089
I am going to savor every
goddamn sparkle on this donut.

823
00:35:47,123 --> 00:35:49,926
- Keep it down.
- What? She don't care.

824
00:35:49,959 --> 00:35:52,394
I know but it's rude,
we just came in...

825
00:35:53,763 --> 00:35:55,564
I don't know
why he's walkin' so fast.

826
00:35:55,597 --> 00:35:58,034
- Just hurry up.
- Must be a fire somewhere.

827
00:35:58,067 --> 00:35:59,568
I'm full!

828
00:35:59,601 --> 00:36:01,838
Come on,
we're full of donuts.

829
00:36:01,871 --> 00:36:04,006
- Okay, come on.
- I gotta pee.

830
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,708
Stop act...
You get so dramatic.

831
00:36:05,741 --> 00:36:07,076
I'm not acting.

832
00:36:07,109 --> 00:36:08,543
What, are you training
for a marathon?

833
00:36:08,577 --> 00:36:10,112
Lil, will you tell
your daughter to...

834
00:36:10,146 --> 00:36:11,646
Is this the Olympics?

835
00:36:11,681 --> 00:36:14,116
- Jesus fucking Christ!
- Are we going to a fire?

836
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:16,618
Fire? What do you mean?
We're going home.

837
00:36:16,651 --> 00:36:18,420
- I'm full!
- I can't run

838
00:36:18,453 --> 00:36:19,856
- in these shoes, Mikey.
- All right.

839
00:36:19,889 --> 00:36:21,958
I don't wanna
throw up my cookies!

840
00:36:21,991 --> 00:36:24,459
Oh, shit, I forgot...
I forgot cigarettes.

841
00:36:24,492 --> 00:36:25,460
Oh, I got a pack.

842
00:36:25,493 --> 00:36:27,629
And I forgot rollin' papers.
I'll be right back.

843
00:36:27,662 --> 00:36:29,065
- All right.
- Yep.

844
00:36:29,098 --> 00:36:30,099
All right.

845
00:37:20,582 --> 00:37:21,583
Psst!

846
00:38:34,589 --> 00:38:36,258
Hello?

847
00:38:40,662 --> 00:38:41,529
- Hi.
- May I help you?

848
00:38:41,563 --> 00:38:44,700
Hi. Yeah. Uh, the ginger
that works here,

849
00:38:44,734 --> 00:38:46,634
she works Tuesdays, no?

850
00:38:46,668 --> 00:38:49,105
- Ginger?
- Uh, red-haired girl.

851
00:38:49,138 --> 00:38:51,073
- Raylee.
- Raylee, yeah.

852
00:38:51,107 --> 00:38:53,943
I called her ginger,
but Raylee. Yeah, Raylee.

853
00:38:53,976 --> 00:38:55,811
- Are you friend of hers?
- Very good friends with her,

854
00:38:55,845 --> 00:38:57,013
I just wanted
to come say "hi."

855
00:38:57,046 --> 00:39:00,716
I always get Tuesdays and
Wednesdays mixed up. So...

856
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:02,251
Yeah, she doesn't
work Tuesdays.

857
00:39:02,284 --> 00:39:04,720
Right, okay. Yeah,
I'll just give her a call

858
00:39:04,754 --> 00:39:05,955
or a text or whatever.

859
00:39:09,624 --> 00:39:11,861
But... But she does
work Wednesdays, right?

860
00:39:11,894 --> 00:39:15,297
- Yeah, she works Wednesdays.
- Okay. Okay. Thought so, yeah.

861
00:39:15,331 --> 00:39:17,833
- You want a donut?
- Uh, how much?

862
00:39:20,102 --> 00:39:22,004
Mm.

863
00:39:31,881 --> 00:39:33,249
Top of the morning
to ya.

864
00:39:33,282 --> 00:39:34,817
Good morning, sir.
What can I grab you?

865
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:37,253
Uh, it's Mikey, not sir.
I'm not that old.

866
00:39:37,286 --> 00:39:38,888
All right,
pleased to meet you, Mikey.

867
00:39:38,921 --> 00:39:40,689
- What's your name?
- Uh, Raylee.

868
00:39:40,723 --> 00:39:43,192
Raylee,
that's a beautiful name.

869
00:39:43,225 --> 00:39:45,795
- What do you recommend?
- Depends on what you like.

870
00:39:45,828 --> 00:39:47,897
- Um, custard one is good.
- Mm.

871
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:50,598
- Jelly is sweet.
- Hmm.

872
00:39:50,632 --> 00:39:52,368
- Glazed is a favorite.
- Ooh, is that your favorite?

873
00:39:52,401 --> 00:39:53,836
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, I might...

874
00:39:53,869 --> 00:39:55,271
I might have
to try that one.

875
00:39:55,304 --> 00:39:58,240
Uh, what did the donuts do
on their first date?

876
00:39:58,274 --> 00:39:59,641
I beg your pardon?

877
00:39:59,674 --> 00:40:00,943
What did the donuts do
on their first date?

878
00:40:00,976 --> 00:40:02,211
I don't know.

879
00:40:02,244 --> 00:40:03,345
They glazed

880
00:40:03,379 --> 00:40:04,713
into each other's eyes.

881
00:40:04,747 --> 00:40:06,614
That's so stupid.

882
00:40:06,648 --> 00:40:08,250
But I can't believe I haven't
heard that one before.

883
00:40:08,284 --> 00:40:09,785
Well, I wrote it,
you couldn't have heard it.

884
00:40:09,819 --> 00:40:11,619
I kinda write donut jokes

885
00:40:11,653 --> 00:40:14,223
on the side.
It's one of my many talents.

886
00:40:14,256 --> 00:40:15,424
- Okay.
- Yeah. But I'm thinkin',

887
00:40:15,458 --> 00:40:17,993
I don't know,
maybe I'll just go with the chocolate,

888
00:40:18,027 --> 00:40:19,962
and gotta get
some milk with...

889
00:40:19,995 --> 00:40:22,231
Oh, you guys go ahead,
I'm gonna need a minute.

890
00:40:22,264 --> 00:40:24,200
- Thank you, buddy.
- Hey. What can I grab ya?

891
00:40:24,233 --> 00:40:26,102
I would like
a large coffee, please.

892
00:40:26,135 --> 00:40:28,904
- Mm-hmm.
- Uh, one hazel cream,

893
00:40:28,938 --> 00:40:30,940
- and two chocolate donuts.
- Okay.

894
00:40:31,874 --> 00:40:33,242
Help yourself
to the cream.

895
00:40:33,275 --> 00:40:34,743
And what can I get
for you, sir?

896
00:40:34,777 --> 00:40:36,679
I'll get a coffee black,

897
00:40:36,712 --> 00:40:39,281
and a filled donut,
and that'll be it for me.

898
00:40:39,315 --> 00:40:40,749
Sweet. Can they share
the same bag?

899
00:40:40,783 --> 00:40:42,251
- Yes, that's fine.
- All right.

900
00:40:43,285 --> 00:40:44,353
Good to conserve.

901
00:40:44,386 --> 00:40:45,921
All righty,
and your coffee

902
00:40:45,955 --> 00:40:48,023
is coming right up, sir.

903
00:40:49,758 --> 00:40:51,827
- Good morning.
- What's the damage?

904
00:40:51,861 --> 00:40:54,063
Uh... $6.32.

905
00:40:54,096 --> 00:40:55,698
- Here you go.
- Out of ten.

906
00:41:02,771 --> 00:41:05,174
Hey, Ms. Phan, can I get
some help out here?

907
00:41:05,207 --> 00:41:07,209
- Thank you.
- Oh!

908
00:41:07,243 --> 00:41:09,979
- Oh, there's your tip.
- Thank you.

909
00:41:10,012 --> 00:41:11,280
Next customer, please.

910
00:41:11,313 --> 00:41:13,382
Hey, when do things
slow down around here?

911
00:41:13,415 --> 00:41:15,751
- Uh, excuse me?
- What time does it wind down?

912
00:41:15,784 --> 00:41:17,920
Uh, we are slammed
until, like, 2:00-ish.

913
00:41:17,953 --> 00:41:19,121
I'll see you at 2:00.

914
00:41:19,155 --> 00:41:20,990
- Next customer, please.
- Okay.

915
00:41:21,023 --> 00:41:22,892
I'm sorry about that.
Uh, what would you like?

916
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:44,346
I'm back,
just like I promised.

917
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:45,347
I'm a man of my word,

918
00:41:45,381 --> 00:41:48,017
so, in the future,
you can always rely on me.

919
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:50,019
Mm. Back to tell
more donut jokes?

920
00:41:50,052 --> 00:41:52,721
No, that was actually
the only donut joke I had,

921
00:41:52,755 --> 00:41:54,456
and it took me a very
long time to write that one.

922
00:41:54,490 --> 00:41:55,991
It's all I got.
Why, do you have any?

923
00:41:56,025 --> 00:41:58,060
Actually, I do.

924
00:41:58,093 --> 00:42:01,864
Um, what do you call
a Jamaican donut?

925
00:42:03,332 --> 00:42:06,068
Hmm, I like where this is going.
Give me a minute.

926
00:42:06,101 --> 00:42:08,938
Uh, Jamaican donut, huh?
I'm stumped.

927
00:42:09,772 --> 00:42:12,374
Cinnamaan.

928
00:42:12,408 --> 00:42:13,809
- I got to go.
- No.

929
00:42:13,842 --> 00:42:15,144
No, no, seriously,
that was really...

930
00:42:15,177 --> 00:42:16,845
That hurt my feelings,
that was terrible.

931
00:42:16,879 --> 00:42:18,881
That's okay, I forgive you.

932
00:42:18,914 --> 00:42:21,850
- So Raylee, I'm thinking...
- Call me Strawberry.

933
00:42:23,953 --> 00:42:25,754
- Call you what?
- Strawberry.

934
00:42:25,788 --> 00:42:26,889
- Strawberry?
- Mm-hmm.

935
00:42:26,922 --> 00:42:28,824
- Everybody calls me that.
- You're kidding.

936
00:42:29,358 --> 00:42:31,460
Okay. How old are you?

937
00:42:31,493 --> 00:42:33,329
- Who's asking?
- Me.

938
00:42:33,362 --> 00:42:35,030
- Why?
- Come on.

939
00:42:35,064 --> 00:42:37,299
- I'm old enough.
- For what?

940
00:42:38,834 --> 00:42:42,938
Oh, God. I'll be 18
in three weeks, okay?

941
00:42:42,972 --> 00:42:44,974
I knew it,
you're too old for me.

942
00:42:46,909 --> 00:42:48,477
Anyway, Strawberry.

943
00:42:48,510 --> 00:42:50,446
I can't believe that's
your name

944
00:42:50,479 --> 00:42:52,047
I don't know
what donut to get.

945
00:42:52,081 --> 00:42:53,048
I need your help.

946
00:42:53,082 --> 00:42:55,851
I really like the look
of those donut holes.

947
00:42:55,884 --> 00:42:56,986
And those, you know...

948
00:42:57,019 --> 00:42:59,221
Do you frost, do you do the
sprinkles, do you do those?

949
00:42:59,255 --> 00:43:00,189
How... Who makes them?

950
00:43:00,222 --> 00:43:02,324
I do the sprinkles,
and I fill the cream.

951
00:43:02,358 --> 00:43:03,425
- You fill the cream.
- Yeah.

952
00:43:03,459 --> 00:43:04,493
I just want the ones
that you make.

953
00:43:04,526 --> 00:43:05,794
- Okay.
- I want the ones

954
00:43:05,828 --> 00:43:06,962
that you cream-filled.

955
00:43:06,996 --> 00:43:08,564
Does that sound...
Oh, I don't want to get you in trouble.

956
00:43:10,099 --> 00:43:12,334
I'm thinking
maybe a chocolate round,

957
00:43:12,368 --> 00:43:15,271
or maybe I'll get
a strawberry-filled.

958
00:43:15,304 --> 00:43:18,040
- No pun intended.
- Oh, God.

959
00:43:18,073 --> 00:43:19,908
I don't
think she likes me very much.

960
00:43:19,942 --> 00:43:21,944
I don't think
she likes anyone very much.

961
00:43:21,977 --> 00:43:23,979
Yeah,
she's a mean boss.

962
00:43:24,013 --> 00:43:26,081
Anyway, okay.
So, yes, I've decided.

963
00:43:26,115 --> 00:43:27,816
Chocolate round.

964
00:43:27,850 --> 00:43:31,120
Okay, but you want
chocolate sprinkles?

965
00:43:31,153 --> 00:43:32,821
Chocolate cake?

966
00:43:32,855 --> 00:43:34,223
Chocolate Bavarian cream?

967
00:43:34,256 --> 00:43:35,357
There's all those
different chocolates?

968
00:43:35,391 --> 00:43:36,458
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, no.

969
00:43:36,492 --> 00:43:37,826
Now I got to stay here

970
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:38,994
for a few more hours
and decide.

971
00:43:39,028 --> 00:43:40,429
Son of a bitch.

972
00:43:40,462 --> 00:43:41,530
Are you trying
to keep me here?

973
00:43:41,563 --> 00:43:42,598
'Cause
I'll sit in the corner

974
00:43:42,631 --> 00:43:44,600
and contemplate this for
a while until you get off.

975
00:43:44,633 --> 00:43:45,567
What time do you get off?

976
00:43:45,601 --> 00:43:48,237
<i>Oh, feels
so fucking good!</i>

977
00:43:48,270 --> 00:43:50,372
Oh, shit! Fuck, yeah, babe!

978
00:43:50,406 --> 00:43:52,508
- Yeah, you like that shit?
- Oh, yeah.

979
00:43:52,541 --> 00:43:54,209
You like that big dick
inside of you,

980
00:43:54,243 --> 00:43:55,944
- you fucking little slut.
- God, I love this big dick.

981
00:43:58,180 --> 00:44:01,383
- Not bad, huh?
- No, not bad at all.

982
00:44:01,417 --> 00:44:04,286
And I didn't even have to take
one of my magic pills. Hmm.

983
00:44:06,889 --> 00:44:09,491
Uh, I didn't know
you were usin' 'em.

984
00:44:09,525 --> 00:44:11,260
- Well, yeah.
- Oh.

985
00:44:11,293 --> 00:44:14,263
You remember how hard it is
to keep wood on set all day.

986
00:44:14,296 --> 00:44:16,265
Yeah.

987
00:44:16,298 --> 00:44:19,001
Remember when Kristina Rose
almost broke it off?

988
00:44:19,034 --> 00:44:20,636
I do. I do.

989
00:44:20,669 --> 00:44:22,571
I'm surprised
it even works at all.

990
00:44:22,604 --> 00:44:24,606
Oh, it sure works.

991
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:27,242
Oh, yeah.

992
00:44:30,979 --> 00:44:33,182
Love the exterior
decorating, sir.

993
00:44:33,215 --> 00:44:34,249
It's looking spiffy.

994
00:44:42,157 --> 00:44:44,126
All right, Dad,
we'll be back around 5:00.

995
00:44:48,397 --> 00:44:50,566
You think
he remembers me?

996
00:44:50,599 --> 00:44:53,335
Man,
ever since my mom died,

997
00:44:53,369 --> 00:44:56,171
all he cares about is keeping
this place immaculate.

998
00:44:58,006 --> 00:44:59,942
Matter of fact,
I've been screwed out

999
00:44:59,975 --> 00:45:02,111
of Male Performer of the year
literally five times.

1000
00:45:02,144 --> 00:45:03,479
But you know what?

1001
00:45:03,512 --> 00:45:04,913
I don't say shit,
it's all good.

1002
00:45:04,947 --> 00:45:06,148
I'm a team player.

1003
00:45:06,181 --> 00:45:07,449
Almost every single girl
I did a scene with

1004
00:45:07,483 --> 00:45:09,251
started fucking me
off-camera, right?

1005
00:45:09,284 --> 00:45:10,552
But the agents hate that shit.

1006
00:45:10,586 --> 00:45:12,388
But what do they expect?
You know?

1007
00:45:12,421 --> 00:45:14,423
It's like, girl comes by
my model house,

1008
00:45:14,456 --> 00:45:16,959
they see my Hall of Fame
trophy on the mantelpiece.

1009
00:45:16,992 --> 00:45:19,528
They're like, "Oh, my God.
He's famous for fucking."

1010
00:45:19,561 --> 00:45:21,330
Wait,
you used to have your own model house?

1011
00:45:21,363 --> 00:45:23,365
I had three
model houses, bro.

1012
00:45:23,399 --> 00:45:27,169
And the last one...
Ooh, that was a savage-ass house.

1013
00:45:27,202 --> 00:45:29,505
Till I started letting agents
book bottom bitches in there.

1014
00:45:29,538 --> 00:45:30,672
Bottom bitches?

1015
00:45:30,707 --> 00:45:31,974
Yeah, bottom bitches

1016
00:45:32,007 --> 00:45:33,142
are technically
the best of the hookers,

1017
00:45:33,175 --> 00:45:34,410
but they're
still the hookers,

1018
00:45:34,443 --> 00:45:35,511
and that's what
they started sending me,

1019
00:45:35,544 --> 00:45:36,713
was the fucking hookers.

1020
00:45:36,746 --> 00:45:37,847
And that's when
everything went to shit.

1021
00:45:37,881 --> 00:45:41,016
'Cause see, once a porn chick
gets a hooker mentality,

1022
00:45:41,049 --> 00:45:42,484
they become
a fucking nightmare.

1023
00:45:42,518 --> 00:45:44,453
A real pain in my ass.

1024
00:45:44,486 --> 00:45:45,954
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1025
00:45:45,988 --> 00:45:48,190
Dude, I forgot how hot
Gulf Coast bitches are.

1026
00:45:48,223 --> 00:45:50,292
I saw this girl over by the
donut shop at the refinery.

1027
00:45:50,325 --> 00:45:51,694
She works there,
smokin' hot.

1028
00:45:51,728 --> 00:45:53,028
Gorgeous,
drop dead gorgeous.

1029
00:45:53,061 --> 00:45:55,597
And get this,
17 years old.

1030
00:45:55,631 --> 00:45:57,633
Legal as an eagle.

1031
00:45:57,666 --> 00:45:59,268
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1032
00:46:02,638 --> 00:46:05,240
Hey, man, see that strip
of land over there?

1033
00:46:05,274 --> 00:46:06,642
Yeah?

1034
00:46:06,675 --> 00:46:09,111
Them's the Texas
Killing Fields, brother.

1035
00:46:16,452 --> 00:46:17,986
- Strawberry?
- Yeah?

1036
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:20,422
- You blaze, right?
- Why, are you a cop?

1037
00:46:20,456 --> 00:46:22,991
- Let's go smoke one.
- Hmm.

1038
00:46:23,025 --> 00:46:25,594
Hey, Ms. Phan.
Can I take my ten?

1039
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,642
<i>So,
what do you do in LA?</i>

1040
00:46:40,676 --> 00:46:43,245
- I'm in entertainment.
- I knew it.

1041
00:46:43,278 --> 00:46:45,647
You have that Hollywood vibe.

1042
00:46:45,682 --> 00:46:47,349
- Yeah, you think?
- Yeah.

1043
00:46:47,382 --> 00:46:48,484
Oh.

1044
00:46:48,517 --> 00:46:50,986
So,
what do you do in entertainment?

1045
00:46:51,587 --> 00:46:53,589
Manager
slash agent.

1046
00:46:53,622 --> 00:46:54,691
Like, for actors?

1047
00:46:54,724 --> 00:46:57,392
Yeah.
That weed is good, right?

1048
00:46:57,426 --> 00:46:58,527
If you
or your friends want any,

1049
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,662
I can get a whole bunch more,
no problem.

1050
00:47:03,165 --> 00:47:05,100
So...

1051
00:47:05,133 --> 00:47:07,804
You live in Hollywood,
managing actors,

1052
00:47:07,837 --> 00:47:11,206
but you're in Texas City,
riding a bike,

1053
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:13,575
sellin' weed, and hittin'
on high schoolers?

1054
00:47:13,609 --> 00:47:15,611
Well, my Camaro is in LA.

1055
00:47:15,644 --> 00:47:18,247
You know, I wasn't going
to drive all the way to Texas,

1056
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:19,615
it's like
a three-day drive.

1057
00:47:20,817 --> 00:47:22,484
All right, look,

1058
00:47:22,518 --> 00:47:23,753
I'm here taking care
of my mom.

1059
00:47:23,786 --> 00:47:25,521
All right?
She's not doing too well.

1060
00:47:27,456 --> 00:47:28,590
I'm sorry.

1061
00:47:28,624 --> 00:47:30,392
It's all right.

1062
00:47:30,425 --> 00:47:31,527
But you're a good son

1063
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:33,395
- for being there for your mom.
- I am.

1064
00:47:35,832 --> 00:47:38,300
By the way,
who smokes joints anymore?

1065
00:47:38,333 --> 00:47:40,803
That's so old man-y.

1066
00:47:40,837 --> 00:47:43,171
That was fun, we should
do that again sometime.

1067
00:47:43,205 --> 00:47:44,707
Yeah, I'll smoke
your weed anytime.

1068
00:47:46,475 --> 00:47:48,544
Hey, by the way,
you can move all your shit

1069
00:47:48,577 --> 00:47:50,612
on the hardhats
from the refinery.

1070
00:47:50,646 --> 00:47:52,114
I see them
at the end of their shift,

1071
00:47:52,147 --> 00:47:53,683
and they want
to kill themselves.

1072
00:47:54,851 --> 00:47:56,285
See you later, alligator.

1073
00:47:56,318 --> 00:47:58,120
In a while, crocodile.

1074
00:48:07,697 --> 00:48:09,732
<i>Did the dress designer</i>

1075
00:48:09,766 --> 00:48:11,667
<i>cause a prom queen
to be late for the ball?</i>

1076
00:48:11,701 --> 00:48:12,936
<i>I went there,
all he had</i>

1077
00:48:12,969 --> 00:48:16,104
<i>was the cut-out fabric
and the applique sewn on.</i>

1078
00:48:16,138 --> 00:48:17,740
<i>That's all he had...</i>

1079
00:48:17,774 --> 00:48:20,409
- Oh! Oh, shit!
- Oh, my gosh.

1080
00:48:20,442 --> 00:48:22,144
I'm sorry!

1081
00:48:22,177 --> 00:48:24,546
Sorry, Lil. Aw, man!

1082
00:48:27,583 --> 00:48:29,484
I thought you found
my couch comfy.

1083
00:48:29,518 --> 00:48:31,620
Oh, I do, I just...
I sleep <i>au naturel.</i>

1084
00:48:32,588 --> 00:48:34,256
- Cut the shit.
- My bad.

1085
00:48:43,432 --> 00:48:45,233
Mikey.

1086
00:48:45,267 --> 00:48:46,368
All seriousness.

1087
00:48:46,401 --> 00:48:49,271
I appreciate you
taking care of the bills.

1088
00:48:49,304 --> 00:48:52,775
That way it keeps Lexi from
being on the Craigslist.

1089
00:48:54,409 --> 00:48:55,611
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

1090
00:48:55,644 --> 00:48:56,813
Yeah, I understand...
Yeah.

1091
00:48:56,846 --> 00:49:00,382
So, I need to know,
are you in or out?

1092
00:49:00,817 --> 00:49:02,685
If you're in,

1093
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:04,553
I welcome you here.

1094
00:49:04,586 --> 00:49:05,788
All right, okay, great.

1095
00:49:05,822 --> 00:49:06,856
'Cause if you're out,

1096
00:49:06,889 --> 00:49:07,924
don't let the door hit you
in the ass.

1097
00:49:07,957 --> 00:49:09,625
No, no. I'm in. I'm in.

1098
00:49:09,658 --> 00:49:11,627
- Okay, fine.
- I'm paying the fucking rent,

1099
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:14,663
- I pay for groceries...
- This is about my baby.

1100
00:49:14,697 --> 00:49:16,398
I don't want her
getting hurt anymore.

1101
00:49:16,431 --> 00:49:19,468
I don't want her
doin' clients anymore.

1102
00:49:19,501 --> 00:49:20,636
It's too dangerous.

1103
00:49:20,669 --> 00:49:22,905
I never know
when she's coming home.

1104
00:49:24,272 --> 00:49:25,574
So, it's up to you.

1105
00:49:27,309 --> 00:49:28,745
I'm in.

1106
00:49:28,778 --> 00:49:30,145
Okay? I'm in.

1107
00:49:31,546 --> 00:49:34,416
- Okay. Good, good. Good.
- I'm here, all right?

1108
00:49:35,785 --> 00:49:37,285
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1109
00:49:40,790 --> 00:49:43,826
Anything else?
Am I good to go?

1110
00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:46,729
Yes. As long as I don't see
your junk anymore.

1111
00:49:47,529 --> 00:49:48,831
Deal.

1112
00:49:48,865 --> 00:49:50,599
Your mom's still a trip.

1113
00:49:50,632 --> 00:49:51,834
I know.

1114
00:49:53,703 --> 00:49:55,504
- In a good way.
- Yeah.

1115
00:49:56,773 --> 00:49:57,940
She's a piece of work.

1116
00:50:04,379 --> 00:50:05,247
That smoke stack,

1117
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:07,382
second one from the left,
is that new?

1118
00:50:07,416 --> 00:50:08,483
Has that
always been there?

1119
00:50:08,517 --> 00:50:10,385
No, that's always
been there.

1120
00:50:10,419 --> 00:50:11,586
- Really?
- Yeah.

1121
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:12,654
Don't remember.

1122
00:50:12,689 --> 00:50:14,289
And Ma calls that one
ol' smokey.

1123
00:50:14,322 --> 00:50:15,457
Oh.

1124
00:50:23,866 --> 00:50:25,367
It's my ex's truck.

1125
00:50:26,936 --> 00:50:29,204
He was supposed to pick
it up two years ago.

1126
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:32,307
Still hasn't.

1127
00:50:41,416 --> 00:50:42,685
Just needs new wheels.

1128
00:50:45,855 --> 00:50:47,556
Well, I know
you guys get tested,

1129
00:50:47,589 --> 00:50:50,492
which is why I got this,
synthetic piss.

1130
00:50:50,525 --> 00:50:52,427
I'll throw it in free
with an ounce,

1131
00:50:52,461 --> 00:50:53,395
other than that,
10 bucks a pop.

1132
00:50:53,428 --> 00:50:55,430
But, yeah, I got you
if you guys ever need it.

1133
00:50:55,464 --> 00:50:57,499
You know, I don't want you
guys getting fired and shit.

1134
00:50:57,532 --> 00:50:58,667
Don't drink it.

1135
00:50:58,701 --> 00:50:59,869
I mean...

1136
00:50:59,902 --> 00:51:00,970
Unless you're into that kind of
shit, right?

1137
00:51:02,304 --> 00:51:03,338
Good night, Ms. Phan!

1138
00:51:03,371 --> 00:51:04,639
- Good night.
- Good night.

1139
00:51:06,541 --> 00:51:08,510
See you later, alligator.

1140
00:51:08,543 --> 00:51:09,746
Do you want a ride home?

1141
00:51:09,779 --> 00:51:11,914
- No, I'm good.
- Throw it in the back.

1142
00:51:11,948 --> 00:51:13,883
Uh, well...

1143
00:51:13,916 --> 00:51:15,250
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Throw it in the back.

1144
00:51:15,650 --> 00:51:16,753
Okay.

1145
00:51:20,388 --> 00:51:22,959
- Which way?
- Uh, go left here. Go left.

1146
00:51:22,992 --> 00:51:24,359
We're getting close.

1147
00:51:25,995 --> 00:51:28,296
I really appreciate you
driving me home.

1148
00:51:28,330 --> 00:51:29,598
Mm-hmm.

1149
00:51:30,398 --> 00:51:32,300
It's a nice area, huh?

1150
00:51:32,334 --> 00:51:33,435
Yeah, it's fancy.

1151
00:51:33,468 --> 00:51:34,336
I just wanted
to buy my mom

1152
00:51:34,369 --> 00:51:36,973
something nice
to retire in, you know?

1153
00:51:37,006 --> 00:51:38,373
That's real sweet of you.

1154
00:51:38,406 --> 00:51:39,508
Yeah.

1155
00:51:39,541 --> 00:51:41,077
All right.
Yeah, it's right up here.

1156
00:51:41,110 --> 00:51:43,478
Hey, we're getting... Yep.
Right up there. There it is.

1157
00:51:45,447 --> 00:51:46,816
Maybe we'll...
Can you turn it down?

1158
00:51:46,849 --> 00:51:48,718
'Cause we don't...
I don't want to wake up my mom.

1159
00:51:48,751 --> 00:51:50,652
Yeah. Whoa,
this is fancy.

1160
00:51:50,686 --> 00:51:51,954
Yeah, it's nice.

1161
00:51:52,955 --> 00:51:55,590
I'd invite you in,
but like I said,

1162
00:51:55,624 --> 00:51:56,993
you know,
my mom's feelin' sick

1163
00:51:57,026 --> 00:51:58,928
and she don't take
too kindly to strangers.

1164
00:51:58,961 --> 00:52:01,630
She's just not all there,
up there right now.

1165
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:02,698
No. Yeah.

1166
00:52:02,732 --> 00:52:04,100
Probably not
a good idea, anyway.

1167
00:52:04,133 --> 00:52:05,968
Yeah.
So thanks for the ride.

1168
00:52:06,002 --> 00:52:08,104
Anytime.
I work on Wednesday.

1169
00:52:08,137 --> 00:52:10,338
Oh, well,
I'll see you Wednesday.

1170
00:52:10,372 --> 00:52:11,406
- Okay.
- Okay.

1171
00:52:43,505 --> 00:52:44,707
<i>Look, I'm just glad</i>

1172
00:52:44,740 --> 00:52:46,042
<i>weed is still illegal
in Texas.</i>

1173
00:52:46,075 --> 00:52:48,077
You guys have no idea
how hard it is

1174
00:52:48,110 --> 00:52:50,512
to move flower
in Cali right now.

1175
00:52:50,545 --> 00:52:51,513
I mean, yeah, you know,

1176
00:52:51,546 --> 00:52:53,448
selling it to the bitches
at my model house,

1177
00:52:53,481 --> 00:52:56,052
but besides that,
felons and illegals.

1178
00:52:57,820 --> 00:53:00,890
Hey, don't mess
with big oil.

1179
00:53:00,923 --> 00:53:04,026
TCPD kittens next
to those Valero guys.

1180
00:53:04,060 --> 00:53:05,627
That goes without saying,

1181
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:07,830
but you know,
keeping it on the DL

1182
00:53:07,864 --> 00:53:09,732
has been the secret to my
success all these years.

1183
00:53:09,765 --> 00:53:11,399
How do you think
I stayed out of prison?

1184
00:53:11,433 --> 00:53:12,935
How do you think
I never got shot?

1185
00:53:12,969 --> 00:53:14,103
Mom,
where's the hot sauce?

1186
00:53:14,136 --> 00:53:16,072
Where the hell
it always been.

1187
00:53:17,572 --> 00:53:19,141
No hot sauce, Mom.
I don't see it.

1188
00:53:19,175 --> 00:53:20,442
Did you look
in your bedroom?

1189
00:53:20,475 --> 00:53:21,543
You were
eatin' pizza there...

1190
00:53:21,576 --> 00:53:22,477
- Oh, my God, Mom.
- ...the other night.

1191
00:53:22,510 --> 00:53:23,746
I don't... I can't...
Where's the hot sauce?

1192
00:53:23,779 --> 00:53:25,047
Why would he take it
into his room?

1193
00:53:25,081 --> 00:53:26,749
You're laughin',
but you were eatin' pizza there.

1194
00:53:26,782 --> 00:53:28,718
Mom, I've checked everywhere
in the kitchen!

1195
00:53:28,751 --> 00:53:30,186
Where's the hot sauce?
Hey, man.

1196
00:53:30,219 --> 00:53:31,687
What are you lookin' at?
This ain't got nothin' to do

1197
00:53:31,721 --> 00:53:32,722
- with you.
- Fine.

1198
00:53:33,956 --> 00:53:35,992
The world would
collapse without me.

1199
00:53:38,761 --> 00:53:40,562
Did you check
under your bed?

1200
00:53:40,595 --> 00:53:43,733
Hey, yo. So, I heard
you do porn or something.

1201
00:53:43,766 --> 00:53:44,867
Five AVNs.

1202
00:53:45,902 --> 00:53:47,602
What? That's an STD?

1203
00:53:47,636 --> 00:53:49,471
No, no, no.
It's the, uh...

1204
00:53:49,504 --> 00:53:50,672
It's the Adult Film Awards,

1205
00:53:50,706 --> 00:53:53,109
it's like the Academy Awards
for what I do.

1206
00:53:53,142 --> 00:53:55,144
- Okay, man. That's what's up.
- Yep.

1207
00:53:55,177 --> 00:53:57,079
Best Oral
three years in a row.

1208
00:53:57,113 --> 00:53:59,015
- Best oral?
- Yep!

1209
00:53:59,782 --> 00:54:01,050
Just one question.

1210
00:54:01,083 --> 00:54:02,919
Ain't that
about getting head?

1211
00:54:02,952 --> 00:54:04,754
Well, I mean...

1212
00:54:04,787 --> 00:54:06,756
Yeah, something like that.

1213
00:54:06,789 --> 00:54:08,724
So, then what they got
to do with you?

1214
00:54:08,758 --> 00:54:11,626
It's not like you're the one
doing any work or anything.

1215
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:13,930
I'm not doing the work?

1216
00:54:13,963 --> 00:54:15,831
Sister,
let me tell you somethin'.

1217
00:54:15,865 --> 00:54:17,166
Hey, man,
don't call me sister.

1218
00:54:17,199 --> 00:54:19,168
Oh, my bad.
June, right, it's June?

1219
00:54:19,201 --> 00:54:20,468
All right, June, look,

1220
00:54:20,502 --> 00:54:22,604
if I won three years in a row,
with three different girls,

1221
00:54:22,637 --> 00:54:24,774
the chances of it being
the girl is pretty limited.

1222
00:54:24,807 --> 00:54:26,175
Think about it.

1223
00:54:26,208 --> 00:54:27,109
No, seriously, look.

1224
00:54:27,143 --> 00:54:29,211
I'm the one guiding
the girl in the scene.

1225
00:54:29,245 --> 00:54:30,947
Essentially
I'm face-fucking her.

1226
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:32,547
Pardon my language.

1227
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:35,718
So the female really has
nothing to do with it.

1228
00:54:35,751 --> 00:54:36,819
You know, I'm the one
that's holding her head

1229
00:54:36,852 --> 00:54:39,487
for like 15 or 20 minutes
while I'm force-fucking her,

1230
00:54:39,521 --> 00:54:40,990
so how is that about her,
exactly?

1231
00:54:41,023 --> 00:54:42,258
- I got it, man.
- No, seriously.

1232
00:54:42,291 --> 00:54:43,926
Look, it's about
the shit I say,

1233
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:45,728
the way I hold her face
towards the camera

1234
00:54:45,761 --> 00:54:47,730
while she spits,
and drools all over herself,

1235
00:54:47,763 --> 00:54:49,865
and I pinch her nose
and make her gag.

1236
00:54:49,899 --> 00:54:51,901
- It's all technique.
- I said I got it.

1237
00:55:30,873 --> 00:55:33,275
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1238
00:55:33,309 --> 00:55:34,910
Thanks, D.

1239
00:55:35,945 --> 00:55:38,848
Man, this place
is off the chain.

1240
00:55:38,881 --> 00:55:40,983
Thank you so much
for hooking this up.

1241
00:55:41,017 --> 00:55:42,284
My pleasure.

1242
00:55:43,085 --> 00:55:45,587
So tell me more about LA.

1243
00:55:47,289 --> 00:55:49,258
Maybe you should find out
for yourself.

1244
00:55:49,291 --> 00:55:50,993
You think
I have the money to go?

1245
00:55:53,095 --> 00:55:55,297
You got a truck,
you can go anytime you want.

1246
00:55:55,331 --> 00:55:57,033
That's my mama's truck.

1247
00:55:57,066 --> 00:56:01,303
She just let's me use it
'cause she works from home.

1248
00:56:01,337 --> 00:56:05,307
Well, when I left Texas City,
I didn't have a dime.

1249
00:56:05,341 --> 00:56:07,243
I just said to myself,

1250
00:56:07,276 --> 00:56:09,211
"Mikey, one day,
you're gonna own this town."

1251
00:56:09,245 --> 00:56:10,780
And I just went for it,
you know?

1252
00:56:12,114 --> 00:56:13,315
Mm.

1253
00:56:14,383 --> 00:56:16,085
What is he doing
behind the counter?

1254
00:56:16,118 --> 00:56:18,254
He's going to help me
with my SAT prep.

1255
00:56:19,055 --> 00:56:20,588
No free donuts.

1256
00:56:21,123 --> 00:56:22,624
Thank you.

1257
00:56:24,659 --> 00:56:28,798
So you were saying something
about just going for it.

1258
00:56:31,901 --> 00:56:33,969
Are you trying
to get fired?

1259
00:56:34,003 --> 00:56:35,603
I'm trying to get hired.

1260
00:56:39,208 --> 00:56:42,378
Are you going to help me
score high on my SATs?

1261
00:56:42,411 --> 00:56:44,180
You get 600 points

1262
00:56:44,213 --> 00:56:45,714
just for signing your name,
you know?

1263
00:56:45,748 --> 00:56:47,783
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1264
00:56:50,086 --> 00:56:51,854
Hiya! What can I
get for ya today?

1265
00:56:51,887 --> 00:56:53,189
Hi, sweetie.
Can I get, uh, two...

1266
00:56:53,222 --> 00:56:55,958
Two chocolate covered
donuts and a medium coffee?

1267
00:56:55,991 --> 00:56:57,359
All right.

1268
00:56:57,393 --> 00:56:58,861
Good afternoon, sir.

1269
00:57:05,067 --> 00:57:07,369
You're crazy,
you know that?

1270
00:57:07,403 --> 00:57:09,872
You could have just
waited until now, you know?

1271
00:57:09,905 --> 00:57:11,373
Where's the fun in that?

1272
00:57:11,407 --> 00:57:12,640
Hmm.

1273
00:57:17,113 --> 00:57:18,180
Come here.

1274
00:57:39,368 --> 00:57:40,769
Yo, Lonnie!

1275
00:57:41,904 --> 00:57:42,972
Wait up!

1276
00:57:44,006 --> 00:57:45,241
What's up, man?

1277
00:57:45,274 --> 00:57:47,009
What up, big dog,
where you going?

1278
00:57:47,042 --> 00:57:48,878
Man, some errands.
I got to go to the mall,

1279
00:57:48,911 --> 00:57:50,679
- stuff like that.
- Mm.

1280
00:57:50,713 --> 00:57:52,414
Cool. Cool.
I'm rolling with you.

1281
00:57:52,448 --> 00:57:55,251
Uh, just warning you, man,
I'm gonna be gone all day.

1282
00:57:55,284 --> 00:57:57,853
Just, uh...
So if you don't want to go,

1283
00:57:57,887 --> 00:57:58,854
- I mean...
- Whatever.

1284
00:57:58,888 --> 00:58:00,689
I just got to get the fuck out
of here. Let's go.

1285
00:58:00,723 --> 00:58:03,692
She's smokin' hot.
She made the first move.

1286
00:58:03,726 --> 00:58:04,693
She's got no dad.

1287
00:58:04,727 --> 00:58:07,296
And here's the kicker,
she lets me sell weed

1288
00:58:07,329 --> 00:58:09,698
to the hardhats at her work.

1289
00:58:09,732 --> 00:58:11,267
I mean, does it get
any better than this?

1290
00:58:14,336 --> 00:58:15,838
I didn't know you served.

1291
00:58:15,871 --> 00:58:18,240
Uh... Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I did, man.

1292
00:58:20,376 --> 00:58:22,111
Thank you
for your service.

1293
00:58:22,144 --> 00:58:24,113
Yeah, man, no, uh...
No problem.

1294
00:58:27,816 --> 00:58:31,820
Man, this place ain't changed
much in 15 years, Lonnie.

1295
00:58:31,854 --> 00:58:33,189
Yeah, I know,
for real, man.

1296
00:58:33,222 --> 00:58:35,024
Hey, um...

1297
00:58:35,057 --> 00:58:36,358
I think I'm going to be
hanging out over here

1298
00:58:36,392 --> 00:58:37,459
- for a while, okay?
- Okay.

1299
00:58:37,493 --> 00:58:39,361
Yeah, I'll meet you back here in
30, all right?

1300
00:58:39,395 --> 00:58:40,429
- Thirty minutes?
- Yeah, thirty.

1301
00:58:40,462 --> 00:58:41,297
All right, sounds good.

1302
00:58:53,409 --> 00:58:55,211
Oh, shit!

1303
00:58:56,946 --> 00:58:58,013
Ah...

1304
00:59:02,451 --> 00:59:03,886
Oh!

1305
00:59:05,554 --> 00:59:06,755
Whoo.

1306
00:59:09,792 --> 00:59:10,960
Oh, come on...

1307
00:59:14,897 --> 00:59:16,165
Whoo!

1308
00:59:16,198 --> 00:59:18,133
So what's
this one, then?

1309
00:59:18,167 --> 00:59:20,369
Uh, that's the one I got
when I was in Afghanistan.

1310
00:59:20,402 --> 00:59:23,105
And, uh, that's for
my three tours in Iraq.

1311
00:59:23,138 --> 00:59:24,506
Bullshit.
You're not even wearing

1312
00:59:24,540 --> 00:59:26,809
the proper
infantry uniform.

1313
00:59:26,842 --> 00:59:28,377
Well, yeah,
of course I am.

1314
00:59:32,314 --> 00:59:33,949
<i>What's
the Army Uniform Regulation?</i>

1315
00:59:33,983 --> 00:59:35,551
The code.

1316
00:59:35,584 --> 00:59:37,386
Uh, to do my best,

1317
00:59:37,419 --> 00:59:40,155
to do my duty
and to serve my country.

1318
00:59:41,257 --> 00:59:43,993
You sure
it's not AR670-1?

1319
00:59:44,026 --> 00:59:46,228
Uh, well,
as you guys know,

1320
00:59:46,262 --> 00:59:48,497
there's a lot of different
codes in the military.

1321
00:59:48,530 --> 00:59:50,799
Stolen valor
right here, folks.

1322
00:59:50,833 --> 00:59:54,203
This man is not a veteran.
He's a fake and a fraud.

1323
00:59:54,236 --> 00:59:56,038
Give me those back,
those are mine.

1324
00:59:56,071 --> 00:59:57,906
- Take your jacket off.
- This is bullshit,

1325
00:59:57,940 --> 00:59:59,108
what do I have to do to
convince y'all this is from...

1326
00:59:59,141 --> 01:00:01,443
Take it off or I'm
gonna fucking kick your ass.

1327
01:00:07,516 --> 01:00:08,550
Hey, man.

1328
01:00:29,938 --> 01:00:32,441
Whiskey Tango Foxtrot.

1329
01:00:32,474 --> 01:00:34,076
Wait, what?

1330
01:00:34,109 --> 01:00:35,577
Really? I would think
someone in your position

1331
01:00:35,611 --> 01:00:36,812
would know what that means.

1332
01:00:38,013 --> 01:00:41,083
Oh, shit. Yeah, man,
I kinda had, like,

1333
01:00:41,116 --> 01:00:43,085
a little bathroom mishap
in there.

1334
01:00:43,118 --> 01:00:45,020
Oh, man,
little bathroom mishap.

1335
01:00:45,054 --> 01:00:47,122
Oh, you sure you didn't
get pushed in the fountain?

1336
01:00:48,090 --> 01:00:49,291
Shit.

1337
01:00:49,325 --> 01:00:50,926
You fucking saw that, man?

1338
01:00:50,959 --> 01:00:52,861
Dude, I saw the whole
fucking thing, bro!

1339
01:00:52,895 --> 01:00:53,829
You think I'm stupid?

1340
01:00:53,862 --> 01:00:55,564
I can't be associated
with that shit, bro!

1341
01:00:55,597 --> 01:00:57,533
That's fucked up,
that you would let me be a part

1342
01:00:57,566 --> 01:00:59,501
of your fucking
bullshit scheme, dude!

1343
01:00:59,535 --> 01:01:02,071
I'm fuckin' pissed!
Dude, what if someone recognized me?

1344
01:01:02,104 --> 01:01:04,873
People know who the fuck I am, dawg.
That's wack.

1345
01:01:04,907 --> 01:01:07,409
You need help, bro.
It's fucking scandalous, dude.

1346
01:01:09,411 --> 01:01:11,847
I'm sorry, man.
Shit, my bad.

1347

- Yes!

1353
01:01:40,075 --> 01:01:42,444
That dope sure makes
you guys religious, huh.

1354
01:02:15,444 --> 01:02:17,012
Just a friend.

1355
01:02:17,045 --> 01:02:19,381
Seems like
a very friendly friend.

1356
01:02:19,415 --> 01:02:21,950
Yeah. It's whatever.

1357
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:27,256
So I blew him
at junior prom.

1358
01:02:28,290 --> 01:02:29,625
At junior prom?

1359
01:02:29,658 --> 01:02:32,327
No, not at, after.
You know what I mean.

1360
01:02:32,361 --> 01:02:34,329
Anyways,
I blew him at junior prom

1361
01:02:34,363 --> 01:02:36,665
and ever since then,
he's been clingy as fuck.

1362
01:02:36,699 --> 01:02:38,667
Is he stalking you?

1363
01:02:38,701 --> 01:02:41,203
No. No, we hang and shit.

1364
01:02:41,236 --> 01:02:43,939
- You fuckin' him?
- When I feel like it.

1365
01:02:44,540 --> 01:02:46,442
It's not
like a real thing.

1366
01:02:46,475 --> 01:02:47,943
This guy
thinks you're dating.

1367
01:02:48,610 --> 01:02:50,078
- No...
- Raylee,

1368
01:02:50,112 --> 01:02:52,114
- I need you inside!
- Okay!

1369
01:02:52,147 --> 01:02:54,416
And I told you
not to smoke in front.

1370
01:02:54,450 --> 01:02:55,517
Sorry.

1371
01:02:57,119 --> 01:02:58,220
So you gonna
keep fucking him?

1372
01:02:58,688 --> 01:03:00,522
That depends.

1373
01:03:00,556 --> 01:03:04,159
- Does he know that?
- Mm-mm!

1374
01:03:04,193 --> 01:03:06,228
All right,
what's this guy's name?

1375
01:03:06,261 --> 01:03:07,529
Nash.

1376
01:03:07,563 --> 01:03:09,298
Nash?

1377
01:03:09,331 --> 01:03:10,499
All right, look.

1378
01:03:10,532 --> 01:03:12,000
I think it's time
Nash got it

1379
01:03:12,034 --> 01:03:14,102
that you guys
aren't dating. Come on.

1380
01:03:14,136 --> 01:03:15,537
Wait, what?

1381
01:03:15,571 --> 01:03:17,272
God, this is crazy.

1382
01:03:17,306 --> 01:03:18,741
This is crazy,
this is insane.

1383
01:03:18,775 --> 01:03:20,442
I can't believe
we're doing this right now.

1384
01:03:20,476 --> 01:03:22,344
Like...

1385
01:03:22,377 --> 01:03:24,213
Like, maybe it's not
such a good idea, you know.

1386
01:03:24,246 --> 01:03:27,049
It'll be quick and easy,
he'll get the message.

1387
01:03:27,082 --> 01:03:28,650
Okay.
But no fightin', okay?

1388
01:03:28,685 --> 01:03:30,285
I just wanna
talk to him.

1389
01:03:30,319 --> 01:03:31,721
- You promise?
- Mm-hmm.

1390
01:03:32,755 --> 01:03:35,290
This is crazy.

1391
01:03:39,428 --> 01:03:41,396
- Now what?
- Is this the house?

1392
01:03:41,430 --> 01:03:43,332
- Yeah.
- Mm.

1393
01:03:43,365 --> 01:03:45,267
Oh, my God!

1394
01:03:56,311 --> 01:03:58,113
Wow, that's his mom?

1395
01:03:58,146 --> 01:03:59,581
Hello, ma'am,
would you be so kind

1396
01:03:59,615 --> 01:04:01,283
as to send
Nash out, please?

1397
01:04:04,119 --> 01:04:06,723
- Raylee?
- Hi, Mrs. Parker.

1398
01:04:13,328 --> 01:04:15,264
Nice necklace.
Fucking dork.

1399
01:04:19,368 --> 01:04:20,569
What is this?
What's going on?

1400
01:04:20,602 --> 01:04:23,205
Hey, buddy, I hate to be
the bearer of bad news,

1401
01:04:23,238 --> 01:04:25,708
but
you ain't with Strawberry,

1402
01:04:25,742 --> 01:04:28,176
you never were,
she's with me now.

1403
01:04:28,210 --> 01:04:30,612
- You understand?
- Raylee, what is this?

1404
01:04:30,646 --> 01:04:31,848
I've been trying
to tell you, Nash.

1405
01:04:31,881 --> 01:04:33,615
All right, look, bro,
so you're not going to call her,

1406
01:04:33,649 --> 01:04:34,817
you're not going
to text her

1407
01:04:34,851 --> 01:04:36,184
and you're not going to go
by the Donut Hole anymore,

1408
01:04:36,218 --> 01:04:37,085
you understand me?

1409
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:38,487
Raylee, come on,
I need to talk to you.

1410
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:41,356
Whoa, whoa, whoa, bro.
Hold on. Hold on.

1411
01:04:42,391 --> 01:04:43,793
Whoa, hey,
no fightin', okay?

1412
01:04:43,826 --> 01:04:45,427
You stay
in the car, babe.

1413
01:04:45,460 --> 01:04:46,595
All right, come here.

1414
01:04:46,628 --> 01:04:48,831
Google me, take out
your phone right now

1415
01:04:48,865 --> 01:04:51,533
and google Mikey Saber.
Do it, you got your phone on you?

1416
01:04:51,567 --> 01:04:53,135
What the fuck
are you talking about?

1417
01:04:53,168 --> 01:04:54,804
- No fightin'!
- Babe, it's okay.

1418
01:04:54,837 --> 01:04:57,439
20.1 million views
on Pornhub, bro.

1419
01:04:57,472 --> 01:04:58,674
I'm not fuckin'
with you.

1420
01:04:58,708 --> 01:05:00,442
Strawberry's
in a different league now,

1421
01:05:00,475 --> 01:05:01,778
do you understand me?
You can't compete

1422
01:05:01,811 --> 01:05:03,345
with someone
that fucked 1,300 bitches,

1423
01:05:03,378 --> 01:05:04,513
do you get
what I'm saying?

1424
01:05:04,546 --> 01:05:06,148
Hey,
let's not cause a scene!

1425
01:05:07,249 --> 01:05:08,685
What are you doing?
Who is this?

1426
01:05:08,718 --> 01:05:10,319
- Come on.
- I'm with him now.

1427
01:05:10,352 --> 01:05:11,821
Yeah, you heard it from her
mouth, she's with me.

1428
01:05:11,854 --> 01:05:13,188
Are you serious?

1429
01:05:13,221 --> 01:05:15,157
- Come on.
- I'm sorry, dude.

1430
01:05:15,190 --> 01:05:16,793
- It was fun, though.
- It wasn't fun.

1431
01:05:27,269 --> 01:05:28,503
Oh, my God!

1432
01:05:31,373 --> 01:05:32,374
Ah...

1433
01:05:35,778 --> 01:05:37,412
I'll see you tomorrow.

1434
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:39,481
Yeah, you will.

1435
01:06:02,604 --> 01:06:05,641
Life's sweet, Sophie.
Life is sweet.

1436
01:06:08,711 --> 01:06:09,846
X equals negative-b

1437
01:06:09,879 --> 01:06:12,849
plus or minus the square root
of b-squared minus 4ac,

1438
01:06:12,882 --> 01:06:14,383
all over 2a.

1439
01:06:14,416 --> 01:06:16,551
Whoa.
That's geometry?

1440
01:06:16,585 --> 01:06:17,720
Algebra.

1441
01:06:20,522 --> 01:06:21,523
Shit.

1442
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:23,893
It's all right, relax.

1443
01:06:23,926 --> 01:06:25,460
No, that's Nash.

1444
01:06:25,494 --> 01:06:26,796
- That's Nash?
- Mm-hmm.

1445
01:06:26,829 --> 01:06:27,864
Shit.

1446
01:06:27,897 --> 01:06:30,198
I think it's time I had a
man-to-man with this kid.

1447
01:06:30,232 --> 01:06:31,768
No fightin'.

1448
01:06:31,801 --> 01:06:33,836
You know what,
I'm tired of your fucking shit, bro.

1449
01:06:33,870 --> 01:06:35,705
I'm not afraid to fight
you, I don't give a fuck.

1450
01:06:35,738 --> 01:06:37,305
Oh, what,

1451
01:06:37,339 --> 01:06:38,373
this is your mommy
and daddy,

1452
01:06:38,407 --> 01:06:39,508
you brought them
to the dance?

1453
01:06:39,541 --> 01:06:41,978
You can't handle your shit by
yourself, huh, tough guy?

1454
01:06:42,011 --> 01:06:43,880
Sir, your son is fucking
with my girlfriend.

1455
01:06:43,913 --> 01:06:45,313
It ain't cool...

1456
01:06:48,583 --> 01:06:50,787
You motherfucker!

1457
01:06:50,820 --> 01:06:52,955
What the fuck!

1458
01:06:52,989 --> 01:06:54,791
What the fuck, Nash,
what the fuck!

1459
01:06:54,824 --> 01:06:56,291
I'm not with you
anymore!

1460
01:06:56,324 --> 01:06:57,659
Fuck you,
you cheated on me!

1461
01:06:57,694 --> 01:06:59,796
No, I didn't, we were never together!
No! No!

1462
01:06:59,829 --> 01:07:02,230
You come to my home,
threaten my son, motherfucker!

1463
01:07:02,264 --> 01:07:03,866
It took three of you to fuck me
up, you're a pussy!

1464
01:07:03,900 --> 01:07:04,834
What are you talking about,

1465
01:07:04,867 --> 01:07:05,802
what do you mean you're
not with him anymore?

1466
01:07:05,835 --> 01:07:06,501
From the
start, I fuckin' said

1467
01:07:06,535 --> 01:07:08,336
I never wanted
to be with you.

1468
01:07:08,370 --> 01:07:09,872
It was like
a casual fucking thing!

1469
01:07:09,906 --> 01:07:11,741
Fuck that shit,
you wanted me.

1470
01:07:11,774 --> 01:07:12,975
You're a little slut.

1471
01:07:13,009 --> 01:07:15,277
You're a fucking slut!

1472
01:07:15,310 --> 01:07:17,546
Hey, don't call my mama
that, what the fuck?

1473
01:07:17,579 --> 01:07:18,948
You ain't
got nothin' to say?

1474
01:07:18,981 --> 01:07:19,882
You come near
my house again,

1475
01:07:19,916 --> 01:07:21,918
you'll be leaving
in a body bag, bitch!

1476
01:07:21,951 --> 01:07:23,652
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1477
01:07:23,686 --> 01:07:24,954
He should
go to the hospital.

1478
01:07:24,987 --> 01:07:26,588
Yeah, maybe you should
go to the hospital?

1479
01:07:26,621 --> 01:07:28,024
No. It's not that bad,

1480
01:07:28,057 --> 01:07:30,325
and plus I don't have
health insurance, anyway,

1481
01:07:30,358 --> 01:07:31,393
but thank you,
Ms. Phan.

1482
01:07:31,426 --> 01:07:32,929
- Okay, now stop movin'.
- All right.

1483
01:07:32,962 --> 01:07:35,031
There's no fighting
in my parking lot.

1484
01:07:35,064 --> 01:07:36,933
He flat-out
sucker-punched me.

1485
01:07:36,966 --> 01:07:39,401
I would have 100%
out-cardio'd that guy.

1486
01:07:39,434 --> 01:07:41,336
Fuck.
Sorry for swearing.

1487
01:07:43,873 --> 01:07:45,708
Oh.
Oh, shit, be careful,

1488
01:07:45,742 --> 01:07:47,009
- that's where he kicked me.
- I'm gonna come.

1489
01:07:47,043 --> 01:07:48,310
That's right where
he kicked me.

1490
01:07:48,343 --> 01:07:50,278
That fuckin'
little bitch. Oh.

1491
01:07:50,312 --> 01:07:53,482
Oh, shit.
Ah, am I bleeding out of my head?

1492
01:07:53,515 --> 01:07:55,317
Fuck.

1493
01:08:01,623 --> 01:08:03,358
We're both going to be
hurtin' tomorrow.

1494
01:08:04,093 --> 01:08:05,460
Why is that?

1495
01:08:06,729 --> 01:08:08,798
Let's just say
you're blessed.

1496
01:08:08,831 --> 01:08:10,532
Uh-uh.

1497
01:08:10,565 --> 01:08:13,668
Yeah, I can't believe I'm
attracted to a ginger.

1498
01:08:13,703 --> 01:08:15,637
You're not allowed
to use the G word.

1499
01:08:18,074 --> 01:08:19,341
You have a type?

1500
01:08:19,842 --> 01:08:21,010
Maybe.

1501
01:08:21,043 --> 01:08:22,812
What's your type?

1502
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:25,948
Let's just say

1503
01:08:25,982 --> 01:08:28,583
- I like men, not boys.
- Mm.

1504
01:08:53,075 --> 01:08:54,643
Oh. Um...

1505
01:08:54,676 --> 01:08:57,947
I'm sorry, I think
I have the wrong house.

1506
01:08:57,980 --> 01:08:59,514
Yeah, 'cause
I saw you parked

1507
01:08:59,548 --> 01:09:01,717
in front of my house
last night, too.

1508
01:09:01,751 --> 01:09:03,886
No, it's... It's a simple mistake.
I'm new in town.

1509
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:05,922
If I see you around
here again...

1510
01:09:05,955 --> 01:09:07,824
No, no, no. It's okay.
It's okay.

1511
01:09:29,946 --> 01:09:31,714
Honestly,
if shit was different,

1512
01:09:32,882 --> 01:09:35,151
I could take over
the industry with her.

1513
01:09:35,184 --> 01:09:36,418
- Think so?
- Yeah.

1514
01:09:36,451 --> 01:09:38,855
Within six months,
I could see her nabbing Best Newcomer.

1515
01:09:38,888 --> 01:09:40,890
One year and she would
sweep the AVNs.

1516
01:09:40,923 --> 01:09:42,490
Tori Black...
You know who Tori Black is?

1517
01:09:42,524 --> 01:09:44,160
Yeah, man, of course,
I know who Tori Black is.

1518
01:09:44,193 --> 01:09:46,062
All right. Well, uh,
she won Performer of the Year

1519
01:09:46,095 --> 01:09:47,730
two years, back to back, right?

1520
01:09:47,763 --> 01:09:49,564
I think that Strawberry's
got the potential.

1521
01:09:49,598 --> 01:09:50,632
I'm not exaggerating,

1522
01:09:50,665 --> 01:09:51,734
- I really believe this.
- Okay.

1523
01:09:51,767 --> 01:09:54,837
I think... I think she could
win three years in a row.

1524
01:09:54,871 --> 01:09:56,538
With my guidance,
of course.

1525
01:10:00,542 --> 01:10:02,879
Doesn't matter, I'm stuck
in this shithole anyway.

1526
01:10:04,146 --> 01:10:06,716
Yeah, man, it's gonna be
kind of awkward anyway,

1527
01:10:06,749 --> 01:10:07,616
she's gonna have to bang

1528
01:10:07,649 --> 01:10:09,752
all those other fucking guys
on the scene.

1529
01:10:09,785 --> 01:10:11,153
I don't give a fuck.

1530
01:10:11,187 --> 01:10:13,521
I'll be fucking
other bitches, bro.

1531
01:10:13,555 --> 01:10:16,025
Come on.
I think it's hot, I don't care.

1532
01:10:17,492 --> 01:10:19,427
Okay, man.

1533
01:10:19,461 --> 01:10:21,030
I mean, seriously,
it's part of the game.

1534
01:10:22,899 --> 01:10:24,934
- That was nice.
- Mm-hmm.

1535
01:10:34,243 --> 01:10:35,845
You want to explain
those bruises?

1536
01:10:38,247 --> 01:10:39,648
I fell off my bike.

1537
01:10:41,250 --> 01:10:42,450
Mm.

1538
01:10:45,922 --> 01:10:47,555
Must've been
a hard fall.

1539
01:10:48,490 --> 01:10:49,725
Mm-hmm.

1540
01:11:08,177 --> 01:11:09,845
This is eight,
I need ten.

1541
01:11:16,719 --> 01:11:18,754
I'm moving a lot of
weight for you guys, huh?

1542
01:11:24,093 --> 01:11:25,928
I like those gold teeth.

1543
01:11:25,962 --> 01:11:28,197
I got one dia...
I got one diamond,

1544
01:11:28,230 --> 01:11:30,665
I had my dentist in Cali
put it in. So...

1545
01:11:33,269 --> 01:11:35,004
Yo, get your ass
out of here, man.

1546
01:11:37,672 --> 01:11:39,208
All right, say hi
to your mom for me.

1547
01:12:01,163 --> 01:12:03,565
These refinery boys
are the best.

1548
01:12:03,598 --> 01:12:04,734
They buy way more weed

1549
01:12:04,767 --> 01:12:07,970
than these skaters and
dancers I got to deal with.

1550
01:12:08,004 --> 01:12:10,006
- Dancers?
- Yeah, from the titty bar.

1551
01:12:10,039 --> 01:12:11,539
Oh, strippers.

1552
01:12:11,573 --> 01:12:14,143
They prefer the term
"dancers," young lady.

1553
01:12:14,176 --> 01:12:16,846
- Show some respect.
- Okay.

1554
01:12:16,879 --> 01:12:17,980
Topless dancers.

1555
01:12:18,014 --> 01:12:20,783
Oh, bottomless, too.
They got it all.

1556
01:12:20,816 --> 01:12:23,019
- Really?
- Yeah, what, you never been?

1557
01:12:23,052 --> 01:12:23,986
Well, why would I have been?

1558
01:12:24,020 --> 01:12:26,322
Plus, I'm not even
old enough to get in.

1559
01:12:26,355 --> 01:12:28,824
That's fine.
You want to go?

1560
01:12:28,858 --> 01:12:30,192
Seriously?

1561
01:12:30,226 --> 01:12:31,994
Strip club virgin!

1562
01:12:36,799 --> 01:12:38,334
- Hello.
- Hello.

1563
01:12:38,367 --> 01:12:39,969
- How old is she?
- Eighteen.

1564
01:12:40,002 --> 01:12:41,137
Eighteen.

1565
01:12:41,170 --> 01:12:42,637
Twenty bucks.

1566
01:12:43,605 --> 01:12:45,808
You're hotter than
all these girls combined.

1567
01:12:46,909 --> 01:12:48,778
If you worked here,
they'd be out of a job.

1568
01:12:49,945 --> 01:12:51,680
You want to
give her a tip?

1569
01:12:51,714 --> 01:12:52,848
Come on, let's go.
Let's give it to 'em.

1570
01:12:52,882 --> 01:12:54,116
It's fun. Come on.

1571
01:13:28,984 --> 01:13:29,952
Right here.
Right here.

1572
01:13:29,985 --> 01:13:31,754
- Here?
- Yeah, pull in there.

1573
01:13:34,256 --> 01:13:35,825
I just gotta
get some milk.

1574
01:13:39,829 --> 01:13:41,663
All right, well...

1575
01:13:42,698 --> 01:13:44,266
- Good night.
- Oh, I can...

1576
01:13:44,300 --> 01:13:46,335
I can wait and drive
you all the way home.

1577
01:13:46,368 --> 01:13:47,703
Oh, no, it's okay.

1578
01:13:47,736 --> 01:13:49,872
I like to ride my bike
at night.

1579
01:13:50,339 --> 01:13:52,341
Okay.

1580
01:13:52,374 --> 01:13:54,777
But, technically,
that was our first date.

1581
01:13:54,810 --> 01:13:57,379
So you just brought me
to a strip joint

1582
01:13:57,413 --> 01:14:00,116
for our first date.
Real classy.

1583
01:14:00,149 --> 01:14:01,817
Ooh, snap.

1584
01:14:01,851 --> 01:14:04,153
Mm. Well, I guess
we got to do it again.

1585
01:14:04,186 --> 01:14:07,790
You want to go to the
pier Friday night?

1586
01:14:07,823 --> 01:14:09,725
Beats liver and onions
at Luby's.

1587
01:14:09,758 --> 01:14:11,659
I love Luby's.

1588
01:14:16,298 --> 01:14:17,766
<i>So, friends,</i>

1589
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:21,804
<i>it is with humility,
determination,</i>

1590
01:14:21,837 --> 01:14:25,241
<i>and boundless confidence
in America's promise...</i>

1591
01:14:26,275 --> 01:14:29,211
<i>...that I accept
your nomination</i>

1592
01:14:29,245 --> 01:14:32,281
<i>for President
of the United States!</i>

1593
01:14:32,314 --> 01:14:33,382
<i>All right,</i>

1594
01:14:33,415 --> 01:14:35,818
<i>Rich Snarkey
is with us in Washington.</i>

1595
01:14:35,851 --> 01:14:38,387
<i>Rich, what are these
new emails revealing?</i>

1596
01:14:38,420 --> 01:14:40,022
Yeah?

1597
01:14:41,757 --> 01:14:43,392
Mm. Yeah?

1598
01:14:44,226 --> 01:14:45,461
Daddy want to play?

1599
01:14:45,494 --> 01:14:47,696
I don't know
if I'm feeling it.

1600
01:14:47,730 --> 01:14:49,932
Oh, I can feel it. Mm.

1601
01:14:50,799 --> 01:14:53,736
Nice and fast.

1602
01:14:53,769 --> 01:14:55,137
I just don't think
it's happening today.

1603
01:14:55,171 --> 01:14:56,172
Come on.

1604
01:14:57,873 --> 01:14:59,742
Don't
you want to get in me?

1605
01:14:59,775 --> 01:15:02,278
Don't you want to get
in this tight little pussy.

1606
01:15:02,311 --> 01:15:04,880
I don't feel it, I'm sorry.
I'm just not feeling it.

1607
01:15:04,914 --> 01:15:07,316
Jesus Christ.
Okay, okay.

1608
01:15:08,417 --> 01:15:10,719
- What?
- It's fine.

1609
01:15:10,753 --> 01:15:12,922
Whatever.
I didn't want to, anyway.

1610
01:15:28,470 --> 01:15:29,505
Lonnie!

1611
01:15:31,173 --> 01:15:32,174
Lonnie!

1612
01:15:33,042 --> 01:15:36,245
Lonnie! Lon...
Lonniekins!

1613
01:15:37,246 --> 01:15:38,347
Hey!

1614
01:15:38,380 --> 01:15:40,382
Don't be tied up
all day.

1615
01:15:43,485 --> 01:15:45,020
Hey, Lonniekins.

1616
01:15:45,054 --> 01:15:48,090
- Hey, Lexi, what's up?
- Oh, not much.

1617
01:15:48,123 --> 01:15:49,858
- What are you doin'?
- Oh, you know,

1618
01:15:49,892 --> 01:15:51,193
fartin' around
with the old man.

1619
01:15:51,227 --> 01:15:53,362
- Oh, yeah.
- Same shit, different day.

1620
01:15:53,395 --> 01:15:55,064
Oh, I know, I know.

1621
01:15:55,097 --> 01:15:55,965
What are you doin'?

1622
01:15:55,998 --> 01:15:58,400
I'm just, you know,
gettin' some air.

1623
01:15:58,434 --> 01:15:59,703
Some sunshine.

1624
01:16:01,470 --> 01:16:03,172
So you and Mikey
been hangin' out, huh?

1625
01:16:03,205 --> 01:16:05,808
Yeah. It's been fun
having him in town.

1626
01:16:05,841 --> 01:16:07,142
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

1627
01:16:08,477 --> 01:16:11,380
Is he giving you money for all
those rides you're giving him?

1628
01:16:11,413 --> 01:16:12,848
Mm, no.

1629
01:16:12,881 --> 01:16:14,516
I mean, I don't
mind, we're buds.

1630
01:16:14,550 --> 01:16:17,186
I know y'all don't have a set
of wheels right now, so...

1631
01:16:17,219 --> 01:16:19,021
No, we don't,
not right now.

1632
01:16:22,825 --> 01:16:24,860
Yeah, you been working out?

1633
01:16:24,893 --> 01:16:26,462
No.

1634
01:16:26,495 --> 01:16:29,031
- Oh. You look good.
- Thanks.

1635
01:16:29,064 --> 01:16:30,833
You sure you haven't
been working out?

1636
01:16:30,866 --> 01:16:32,468
I'm positive.

1637
01:16:32,501 --> 01:16:34,403
Can't call you "scrawny
Lonnie" no more,

1638
01:16:34,436 --> 01:16:36,138
can I?

1639
01:16:39,041 --> 01:16:40,943
You keep Mikey out of trouble
now, you hear?

1640
01:16:40,976 --> 01:16:42,444
I'll try.

1641
01:16:42,478 --> 01:16:44,413
Okay, I know you will.

1642
01:16:46,382 --> 01:16:47,416
Good seeing you.

1643
01:16:47,449 --> 01:16:48,917
Good seeing you.
Take care.

1644
01:16:52,621 --> 01:16:53,856
There's a lot of rides,

1645
01:16:53,889 --> 01:16:55,858
we could do
the roller-coaster.

1646
01:16:55,891 --> 01:16:56,892
Am I tall enough?

1647
01:16:56,925 --> 01:16:59,228
I think it's, like,
48 inches or whatever.

1648
01:16:59,261 --> 01:17:01,096
I'll give you 48
inches or whatever.

1649
01:17:02,298 --> 01:17:04,166
I'm sorry.
That was too easy.

1650
01:17:04,199 --> 01:17:05,134
But I got you. It's like,

1651
01:17:05,167 --> 01:17:07,102
if you're scared,
just grab onto me, you know.

1652
01:17:07,136 --> 01:17:09,071
I'll hold your hand.

1653
01:17:09,104 --> 01:17:10,939
So, after this,

1654
01:17:10,973 --> 01:17:13,409
are you gonna fuck me
under the boardwalk?

1655
01:17:13,442 --> 01:17:15,944
You're such a little
exhibitionist, you know that?

1656
01:17:15,978 --> 01:17:17,146
Look who's talking.

1657
01:17:17,946 --> 01:17:19,281
Wait, what do you mean?

1658
01:17:20,049 --> 01:17:21,984
You know what I mean.

1659
01:17:22,017 --> 01:17:24,353
Mr. Saber.

1660
01:17:37,533 --> 01:17:39,101
Oh, my God!

1661
01:17:40,469 --> 01:17:42,438
Mikey!

1662
01:17:42,471 --> 01:17:44,306
The second I broke up
with Nash,

1663
01:17:45,107 --> 01:17:46,175
my Facebook blew up

1664
01:17:46,208 --> 01:17:48,077
with everyone
and their fucking grandma

1665
01:17:48,110 --> 01:17:49,478
sending me links
to your videos.

1666
01:17:52,081 --> 01:17:53,882
And you're cool
with it?

1667
01:17:53,916 --> 01:17:56,051
Would I be here
if I gave a shit?

1668
01:17:56,085 --> 01:17:57,519
I actually think
it's kinda dope.

1669
01:17:58,120 --> 01:17:59,121
Hmm.

1670
01:18:00,522 --> 01:18:02,925
I think it's cool
you just said,

1671
01:18:02,958 --> 01:18:04,593
"Fuck it, I'm gonna get paid

1672
01:18:04,626 --> 01:18:06,428
"for doing
the thing I love most."

1673
01:18:06,462 --> 01:18:08,664
And as long as you're
not hurtin' anybody,

1674
01:18:08,698 --> 01:18:10,899
you do you, man.

1675
01:18:10,933 --> 01:18:12,434
But if you give me something,

1676
01:18:12,468 --> 01:18:14,203
I swear to fuckin' God...

1677
01:18:14,236 --> 01:18:15,237
Us porn folk

1678
01:18:15,270 --> 01:18:17,506
are the most tested people
on the whole planet.

1679
01:18:17,539 --> 01:18:18,507
I mean, think about it,

1680
01:18:18,540 --> 01:18:20,976
we got to get tested to
work, you know?

1681
01:18:21,009 --> 01:18:22,277
Maybe I gave you somethin'?

1682
01:18:22,311 --> 01:18:24,413
Oh, don't even kid!

1683
01:18:27,049 --> 01:18:30,018
I posted a nude online once.

1684
01:18:30,052 --> 01:18:32,621
I can never tell if you're
joking or if you're serious.

1685
01:18:32,654 --> 01:18:35,057
My friends and I
were messing around

1686
01:18:35,090 --> 01:18:38,160
on that subreddit,
Gone Wild.

1687
01:18:38,193 --> 01:18:40,429
We were just trying to see how
much attention we could get.

1688
01:18:40,462 --> 01:18:41,463
We weren't even naked,
we had,

1689
01:18:41,497 --> 01:18:43,432
like, our stuffed animals
like that, you know?

1690
01:18:44,433 --> 01:18:46,235
But this old guy
in Ohio

1691
01:18:46,268 --> 01:18:48,370
propositioned us
to sell a nude pic.

1692
01:18:48,404 --> 01:18:51,507
And I did,
and he Venmo'd me 60 bucks.

1693
01:18:51,540 --> 01:18:53,375
- Sixty bucks?
- Mm-hmm.

1694
01:18:53,409 --> 01:18:55,277
You're a bad, bad girl.

1695
01:18:55,310 --> 01:18:56,445
But 60 bucks ain't shit.

1696
01:18:56,478 --> 01:18:59,014
You should get
at least double that.

1697
01:18:59,047 --> 01:19:01,350
So were you planning
on ever telling me?

1698
01:19:01,383 --> 01:19:03,018
Yeah.

1699
01:19:03,051 --> 01:19:05,053
It's not something you drop
on a civilian.

1700
01:19:06,422 --> 01:19:08,524
A civilian?
Is that what I am?

1701
01:19:09,726 --> 01:19:10,926
Yeah.

1702
01:19:11,694 --> 01:19:13,095
But you don't have to be.

1703
01:19:13,996 --> 01:19:15,732
For reals?

1704
01:19:15,765 --> 01:19:19,401
Look,
I'm gonna be straight with you.

1705
01:19:19,435 --> 01:19:22,271
I've been in the business
almost 20 years,

1706
01:19:22,304 --> 01:19:26,341
and nobody,
nobody comes close to you.

1707
01:19:28,076 --> 01:19:30,479
Straight up, you could be a huge
star, I'm just saying.

1708
01:19:32,014 --> 01:19:34,016
- You're funny.
- Mm-hmm.

1709
01:19:35,484 --> 01:19:36,618
Look,

1710
01:19:36,652 --> 01:19:39,689
I'm already about to have
a very awkward senior year.

1711
01:19:39,722 --> 01:19:40,890
Mm.

1712
01:19:40,924 --> 01:19:43,358
I'm not about to have a very
awkward rest of my life.

1713
01:19:43,392 --> 01:19:44,393
Ah.

1714
01:20:04,179 --> 01:20:05,314
...but the second time

1715
01:20:05,347 --> 01:20:06,648
I fell out of the tree,
remember?

1716
01:20:06,683 --> 01:20:09,084
I fell straight down on the
ground and broke my arm,

1717
01:20:09,117 --> 01:20:10,687
so I had a leg broken
and an arm broken.

1718
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:13,188
And then Mom had to wheel me
around in the shoppin' cart

1719
01:20:13,222 --> 01:20:14,256
for, like, a month...

1720
01:20:14,289 --> 01:20:15,324
And you loved that.

1721
01:20:15,357 --> 01:20:16,592
It was so embarrassing.

1722
01:20:16,625 --> 01:20:18,360
- Aw.
- Hey!

1723
01:20:19,661 --> 01:20:21,530
- Hey, Mikey.
- Hmm.

1724
01:20:21,563 --> 01:20:22,598
How you doing?

1725
01:20:22,631 --> 01:20:25,400
I'm good.
What you doin' here?

1726
01:20:25,434 --> 01:20:26,468
Just catchin' up

1727
01:20:26,502 --> 01:20:28,170
- with Lil and Lexi.
- Mm-hmm.

1728
01:20:28,203 --> 01:20:29,638
Catching up
on some old stuff.

1729
01:20:29,671 --> 01:20:31,373
- Mm-hmm.
- Shootin' the breeze.

1730
01:20:31,406 --> 01:20:32,541
- Sounds like it.
- Yeah.

1731
01:20:32,574 --> 01:20:33,509
You should let me know
next time,

1732
01:20:33,542 --> 01:20:37,145
I'll make some steaks.
Hang out with you guys.

1733
01:20:37,179 --> 01:20:38,514
- Sounds great.
- Yeah.

1734
01:20:38,547 --> 01:20:40,482
- Sounds like a plan.
- Mm-hmm.

1735
01:20:40,516 --> 01:20:42,251
Ladies,
I'mma get up outta here.

1736
01:20:42,284 --> 01:20:43,619
- It's getting late.
- Oh, no. Already?

1737
01:20:43,652 --> 01:20:45,254
But your
hospitality was good,

1738
01:20:45,287 --> 01:20:47,589
- the conversation was boss.
- Aw.

1739
01:20:47,623 --> 01:20:49,558
- Okay, girls...
- So good to see you.

1740
01:20:49,591 --> 01:20:50,425
Absolutely.

1741
01:20:50,459 --> 01:20:52,227
So good to see you again, Lele.

1742
01:20:52,261 --> 01:20:53,428
- You, too, my baby.
- Please come back.

1743
01:20:53,462 --> 01:20:55,564
- I will. I will.
- Don't be a stranger.

1744
01:20:55,597 --> 01:20:56,632
You take care of yourself,
baby girl.

1745
01:20:56,665 --> 01:20:57,800
- You, too.
- All right?

1746
01:20:57,834 --> 01:20:59,067
Be safe out there.

1747
01:20:59,101 --> 01:21:00,737
Mikey, I'm sure
I'll see you soon.

1748
01:21:00,770 --> 01:21:01,637
Yeah, you will.

1749
01:21:01,670 --> 01:21:03,305
- Thanks, Lele.
- Good night.

1750
01:21:03,338 --> 01:21:05,140
- Good night.
- God bless you.

1751
01:21:11,781 --> 01:21:13,282
Did it come through?

1752
01:21:13,315 --> 01:21:15,150
<i>Yeah. Bullshit.</i>

1753
01:21:15,183 --> 01:21:18,253
You see her?
She's fuckin' smokin', right?

1754
01:21:18,287 --> 01:21:20,355
You're not gonna
believe this, dude.

1755
01:21:20,389 --> 01:21:22,725
- Her name is Strawberry.
- <i>What?</i>

1756
01:21:22,759 --> 01:21:23,793
Fucking Strawberry.

1757
01:21:23,826 --> 01:21:25,160
You can't make
this shit up, man.

1758
01:21:25,193 --> 01:21:26,094
- <i>Strawberry?</i>
- Yeah. No, I...

1759
01:21:26,128 --> 01:21:28,463
Has there even been
a Strawberry before?

1760
01:21:28,497 --> 01:21:31,333
She's my way back
in, man, I'm tellin' you.

1761
01:21:31,366 --> 01:21:34,737
This is like a Jenna Jameson,
Sasha Grey-level find here.

1762
01:21:34,771 --> 01:21:37,239
Aw, fuck, I'm blessed,
I'm so fucking blessed.

1763
01:21:37,272 --> 01:21:39,608
See, this is my talent,

1764
01:21:39,641 --> 01:21:41,510
I could be a badass scout.

1765
01:21:41,543 --> 01:21:44,413
I got my finger on the pulse
of the next generation, baby.

1766
01:21:45,647 --> 01:21:47,215
How do you know she's
gonna be down for this, man?

1767
01:21:47,249 --> 01:21:50,185
Oh, she's down,
trust me, she's down.

1768
01:21:50,218 --> 01:21:53,388
Plus, she sucks on my fingers
while I'm fucking her, bro.

1769
01:21:53,422 --> 01:21:54,356
Oh, yeah? That's cool.

1770
01:21:54,389 --> 01:21:57,125
Yeah, it's cool.
You know what that means?

1771
01:21:57,159 --> 01:21:58,193
She likes fingers?

1772
01:21:58,226 --> 01:21:59,796
You're so cute.

1773
01:22:01,263 --> 01:22:03,198
Means she likes
having a dick in her mouth

1774
01:22:03,231 --> 01:22:05,768
while getting fucked.
It's a telltale sign, bro.

1775
01:22:05,802 --> 01:22:06,936
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1776
01:22:06,970 --> 01:22:08,905
Any time a girl puts something
in her mouth while fucking,

1777
01:22:08,938 --> 01:22:10,740
either they're familiar
with that scenario

1778
01:22:10,773 --> 01:22:12,709
or they're intrigued
by that scenario.

1779
01:22:12,742 --> 01:22:14,610
Think about it, man,
it's just logic.

1780
01:22:14,643 --> 01:22:16,211
I never thought
about it that way.

1781
01:22:16,244 --> 01:22:18,246
Yeah, man,
no, that's what Lexi did.

1782
01:22:18,280 --> 01:22:19,682
You know,
when we first started dating,

1783
01:22:19,716 --> 01:22:21,818
Lexi would suck on my fingers
while I was fucking her.

1784
01:22:21,851 --> 01:22:23,485
That's what schooled me
to the knowledge

1785
01:22:23,518 --> 01:22:24,553
that she'd slept with

1786
01:22:24,586 --> 01:22:26,188
more than one dude
at a time before.

1787
01:22:26,221 --> 01:22:27,790
So when I proposed
a threesome, she was in.

1788
01:22:27,824 --> 01:22:29,826
She didn't fight it,
she fucking loved it.

1789
01:22:29,859 --> 01:22:31,126
- Huh.
- Yeah.

1790
01:22:33,462 --> 01:22:34,463
Well, what do you think

1791
01:22:34,496 --> 01:22:36,833
Lexi is gonna think
about all of this, though?

1792
01:22:36,866 --> 01:22:39,902
Dude, Lexi is the bane
of my fucking existence, man.

1793
01:22:39,936 --> 01:22:42,471
Everything that has gone wrong
in my life the last 15 years

1794
01:22:42,504 --> 01:22:44,439
pretty much
stems back to her.

1795
01:22:45,708 --> 01:22:47,810
I've forgiven her
over and over again.

1796
01:22:47,844 --> 01:22:49,812
I've overlooked so much shit
in the name of forgiveness,

1797
01:22:49,846 --> 01:22:51,647
but it doesn't matter,
she always fucks me...

1798
01:22:52,749 --> 01:22:54,249
Hey, how you doin', sir?

1799
01:22:59,321 --> 01:23:01,423
Go look up the Lexi Lane,
Ashley Blue gangbang.

1800
01:23:01,456 --> 01:23:02,624
At the end,
I'm fucking Ashley,

1801
01:23:02,658 --> 01:23:04,292
so I wasn't paying attention.

1802
01:23:04,326 --> 01:23:06,863
Lexi starts badmouthing me
to the male talent on camera.

1803
01:23:06,896 --> 01:23:07,930
Saying that I'm limp dick
and shit,

1804
01:23:07,964 --> 01:23:09,197
and that's
a total fucking lie.

1805
01:23:09,231 --> 01:23:10,232
Of course
I can get it up, right?

1806
01:23:10,265 --> 01:23:12,434
I didn't know this until
the fucking DVD came out.

1807
01:23:12,467 --> 01:23:13,836
I wanted to knock
that bitch out.

1808
01:23:13,870 --> 01:23:15,772
Anyway, don't say shit.
That stays between us.

1809
01:23:15,805 --> 01:23:17,572
- I got you, brother.
- You got the next set.

1810
01:23:20,575 --> 01:23:22,377
- Appreciate you.
- Thank you.

1811
01:23:23,980 --> 01:23:26,481
So... I joined
your Pornhub page.

1812
01:23:27,649 --> 01:23:29,384
You watching my scenes?

1813
01:23:29,418 --> 01:23:30,652
Checked out a few.

1814
01:23:30,687 --> 01:23:33,288
I watched the one
you won Best Oral for.

1815
01:23:33,321 --> 01:23:35,992
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1816
01:23:36,025 --> 01:23:38,493
Not that it's not hot watchin'
you, but, like...

1817
01:23:39,028 --> 01:23:40,096
Yeah?

1818
01:23:40,129 --> 01:23:44,399
So the girl,
plus all the guys she's blowin'...

1819
01:23:47,003 --> 01:23:48,738
Hello, Mr. Mikey.

1820
01:23:48,771 --> 01:23:50,672
Hey, Ms. Phan.

1821
01:23:50,707 --> 01:23:52,942
Uh, I swept outside and
watered the plants for you.

1822
01:23:52,975 --> 01:23:53,976
Great.

1823
01:23:57,312 --> 01:24:00,983
So the girl, plus all the guys
she's blowin', win the award?

1824
01:24:01,017 --> 01:24:02,250
Right.

1825
01:24:02,284 --> 01:24:03,853
But we all share it,
the award.

1826
01:24:03,886 --> 01:24:05,822
Okay. But, like,

1827
01:24:05,855 --> 01:24:07,924
she's on her knees
blowing a line of guys,

1828
01:24:07,957 --> 01:24:09,357
it's like her scene.

1829
01:24:09,391 --> 01:24:11,259
Why are you winning
an award for it?

1830
01:24:11,293 --> 01:24:13,295
Okay, well,
that's up for discussion.

1831
01:24:14,596 --> 01:24:16,032
Anyway, you shouldn't
be watching that stuff.

1832
01:24:16,065 --> 01:24:18,000
You know,
just pretend it doesn't exist.

1833
01:24:18,034 --> 01:24:19,702
Don't watch that stuff,
it's not good.

1834
01:24:20,502 --> 01:24:21,771
I'm sorry.

1835
01:24:21,804 --> 01:24:23,706
- Did I hurt your feelings?
- No. It's okay.

1836
01:24:25,074 --> 01:24:26,541
Sorry, I should have asked

1837
01:24:26,575 --> 01:24:28,010
if it was okay
if I watched.

1838
01:24:28,044 --> 01:24:29,578
Hmm.

1839
01:24:31,681 --> 01:24:33,348
Well,
if you do want to watch one,

1840
01:24:33,381 --> 01:24:35,785
check out <i>The Fast and
the Furious</i> parody I did.

1841
01:24:35,818 --> 01:24:37,619
- Are you serious?
- Hell yeah.

1842
01:24:37,652 --> 01:24:40,622
<i>Fast and the Fury-ass.</i>

1843
01:24:40,655 --> 01:24:41,758
- Yeah.
- I love it.

1844
01:24:41,791 --> 01:24:42,859
Clever, right?

1845
01:24:42,892 --> 01:24:45,828
I play Brian O'Conner,
that's Paul Walker's character.

1846
01:24:45,862 --> 01:24:47,897
Man, my acting was next level.
Seriously.

1847
01:24:47,930 --> 01:24:50,565
I mean, my scenes were miles
above the other scenes.

1848
01:24:50,599 --> 01:24:51,901
To this day, people
will tweet me and be like,

1849
01:24:51,934 --> 01:24:53,836
"Oh, you were
the perfect O'Conner."

1850
01:24:53,870 --> 01:24:56,404
I was actually even
nominated for that role.

1851
01:24:56,438 --> 01:24:58,975
Best Supporting Actor
in a Parody.

1852
01:24:59,008 --> 01:25:01,676
But I didn't win.
It was the big snub of the night.

1853
01:25:01,711 --> 01:25:04,379
There was boos and everything.
It was crazy.

1854
01:25:04,412 --> 01:25:07,449
And then Paul Walker goes
and gets himself killed,

1855
01:25:07,482 --> 01:25:08,751
which is such a bummer

1856
01:25:08,785 --> 01:25:11,520
because then I'm fucked
out of the sequels.

1857
01:25:11,553 --> 01:25:12,822
- That sucks.
- Yeah.

1858
01:25:13,756 --> 01:25:14,556
So...

1859
01:25:17,093 --> 01:25:18,761
You want to come over
this weekend?

1860
01:25:20,362 --> 01:25:21,764
Come over?
What, to your place?

1861
01:25:21,798 --> 01:25:23,866
Yeah. We can spend
Saturday night there.

1862
01:25:23,900 --> 01:25:25,101
Uh... Nah, nah,
I'm not into

1863
01:25:25,134 --> 01:25:27,069
the whole
meet-the-parents thing.

1864
01:25:27,103 --> 01:25:28,905
You think I'd introduce you
to my mom?

1865
01:25:28,938 --> 01:25:31,606
Are you fucking kidding me?
No. God, no! No.

1866
01:25:31,640 --> 01:25:34,509
She'll be out of town.
She got a new boyfriend,

1867
01:25:34,543 --> 01:25:36,913
and they're going to Houston
to fuck themselves silly.

1868
01:25:36,946 --> 01:25:39,414
So, we got the place
to our own,

1869
01:25:39,447 --> 01:25:41,050
to fuck ourselves
even sillier.

1870
01:25:42,484 --> 01:25:43,485
Ah!

1871
01:25:47,522 --> 01:25:48,691
- Mikey?
- Yeah?

1872
01:25:50,092 --> 01:25:52,327
You haven't even asked
about Eric once.

1873
01:25:54,629 --> 01:25:56,732
You got my Facebook
message when it happened.

1874
01:25:56,766 --> 01:25:57,834
We chatted.

1875
01:26:02,738 --> 01:26:04,974
My heart goes out to you.
It was a terrible thing.

1876
01:26:11,047 --> 01:26:12,614
So...

1877
01:26:12,647 --> 01:26:15,383
Any word on you getting
custody or whatever?

1878
01:26:17,854 --> 01:26:18,855
Yeah.

1879
01:26:19,789 --> 01:26:21,356
Well, I was thinking...

1880
01:26:22,524 --> 01:26:24,694
I have a meetin'
with CPS next week.

1881
01:26:24,727 --> 01:26:27,930
And I was thinking
you could come with me

1882
01:26:27,964 --> 01:26:30,733
and we could tell
the case worker...

1883
01:26:30,766 --> 01:26:31,767
Her name is Mary-Anne,

1884
01:26:31,801 --> 01:26:34,804
she's real nice and she's
trying to help me out.

1885
01:26:34,837 --> 01:26:38,040
And we can tell her about how
things are going well here

1886
01:26:38,074 --> 01:26:39,075
and, you know...

1887
01:26:40,475 --> 01:26:42,712
Like you and me,
and all...

1888
01:26:45,547 --> 01:26:46,749
'Cause, I mean,

1889
01:26:46,782 --> 01:26:49,451
if things are going well
with you and me and all,

1890
01:26:49,484 --> 01:26:50,987
and I can get
a clean test...

1891
01:26:51,020 --> 01:26:52,387
And that's gonna happen?

1892
01:26:53,155 --> 01:26:54,323
No wonder they took him,

1893
01:26:54,357 --> 01:26:56,424
you're right back to where you
were in '08 all over again.

1894
01:26:58,627 --> 01:27:00,096
Where's his dad
in all this shit anyway?

1895
01:27:00,129 --> 01:27:02,530
Why doesn't he step
the fuck up? Seriously.

1896
01:27:05,567 --> 01:27:07,535
Or better yet,
why doesn't Leondria go with you,

1897
01:27:07,569 --> 01:27:09,805
being that she's so concerned
with our fucking business.

1898
01:27:11,473 --> 01:27:13,475
You know what,
fuck this place.

1899
01:27:13,508 --> 01:27:15,410
I'm going to go watch TV
with your mom.

1900
01:27:47,276 --> 01:27:49,178
Don't judge, okay?

1901
01:27:49,211 --> 01:27:50,947
Why would I do that?

1902
01:27:50,980 --> 01:27:53,215
You're talking to a boy
who grew up in Texas City,

1903
01:27:53,249 --> 01:27:55,117
so I'm not going
to judge anything.

1904
01:27:55,151 --> 01:27:57,687
- This is it?
- Yeah.

1905
01:27:57,720 --> 01:28:00,723
Oh. Uh, I take it back,
this place is a shithole.

1906
01:28:00,756 --> 01:28:01,991
Can you take me
home, please?

1907
01:28:05,695 --> 01:28:06,929
All right, ta-da.

1908
01:28:06,963 --> 01:28:08,998
- Wow. Luxurious.
- Yeah.

1909
01:28:09,031 --> 01:28:10,632
Can't smoke in here,
by the way,

1910
01:28:10,665 --> 01:28:12,600
- my mom's trying to quit.
- That's okay.

1911
01:28:15,071 --> 01:28:16,772
- Is this you?
- Yeah.

1912
01:28:16,806 --> 01:28:18,274
That's the first selfie
I ever took.

1913
01:28:18,307 --> 01:28:20,176
- Mm.
- Vintage.

1914
01:28:20,209 --> 01:28:21,811
- You want a Coke?
- Yes.

1915
01:28:23,145 --> 01:28:25,014
And that's your mom?

1916
01:28:25,047 --> 01:28:28,550
Yep. And that's my
grandma, and that's me.

1917
01:28:28,583 --> 01:28:30,720
And that's me.
And that's me.

1918
01:28:30,753 --> 01:28:31,787
Cute.

1919
01:28:31,821 --> 01:28:32,855
What's back here?

1920
01:28:32,888 --> 01:28:34,023
- Ah, that's my mom's room.
- Oh.

1921
01:28:34,056 --> 01:28:35,224
I am right here.

1922
01:28:40,096 --> 01:28:42,064
Wow. Wow.

1923
01:28:42,865 --> 01:28:43,866
Pink.

1924
01:28:44,700 --> 01:28:45,701
Pink.

1925
01:28:45,735 --> 01:28:47,535
It's supposed to make you
happy or something.

1926
01:28:47,569 --> 01:28:48,570
Yeah.

1927
01:28:49,739 --> 01:28:50,940
Wow.

1928
01:28:57,146 --> 01:28:59,547
So, tell your mom
I'm moving in.

1929
01:29:04,586 --> 01:29:06,055
You feel the sunshine?

1930
01:29:09,158 --> 01:29:10,760
By the way,
what sign are you?

1931
01:29:12,828 --> 01:29:14,030
Why?

1932
01:29:14,063 --> 01:29:17,333
Uh... I mean,
I don't even believe in astrology,

1933
01:29:17,366 --> 01:29:18,734
but I'm just asking.

1934
01:29:20,202 --> 01:29:21,603
A bad sign.

1935
01:29:22,972 --> 01:29:24,740
I don't believe
in that shit, either.

1936
01:29:24,774 --> 01:29:25,775
Yeah.

1937
01:29:32,982 --> 01:29:34,917
You know, before this
place was about black gold,

1938
01:29:34,950 --> 01:29:36,185
it was about black ivory.

1939
01:29:36,952 --> 01:29:38,586
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1940
01:29:38,620 --> 01:29:40,356
I don't understand.

1941
01:29:40,389 --> 01:29:42,590
- Slave trade, silly.
- Oh.

1942
01:29:42,624 --> 01:29:44,126
Slaves were sold here.

1943
01:29:44,160 --> 01:29:47,830
Some, like, famous
French pirate ran the show.

1944
01:29:47,863 --> 01:29:50,299
A French pirate?
I bet he had really good style.

1945
01:29:50,332 --> 01:29:52,301
I bet he dressed good.

1946
01:29:52,334 --> 01:29:55,071
When I was little,
my mama would take me out here

1947
01:29:55,104 --> 01:29:57,006
and we'd go hunting
for pirate booty.

1948
01:29:57,039 --> 01:29:58,074
Ooh.

1949
01:29:58,107 --> 01:29:59,842
- I love pirate booty.
- Ooh.

1950
01:29:59,875 --> 01:30:01,777
Tell me more.

1951
01:30:04,046 --> 01:30:06,215
I'm coming to get ya.

1952
01:30:07,649 --> 01:30:09,218
Fuck!

1953
01:30:21,764 --> 01:30:25,034
This is prime Texas beef
right here.

1954
01:30:25,067 --> 01:30:28,170
This might be the one thing
this place has above LA.

1955
01:30:28,204 --> 01:30:30,272
Besides you, of course.

1956
01:30:30,306 --> 01:30:34,009
You're like an
extraterrestrial around here.

1957
01:30:34,043 --> 01:30:37,213
When I look at you,
I don't think Gulf Coast,

1958
01:30:37,246 --> 01:30:39,647
you know...
Well, besides the sexy drawl.

1959
01:30:39,682 --> 01:30:41,317
You jerk.
It's not that bad.

1960
01:30:41,350 --> 01:30:42,785
It's pretty bad.

1961
01:30:42,818 --> 01:30:44,120
Stop makin' fun of me.

1962
01:30:44,153 --> 01:30:46,822
I'm not.
I had one, but I lost it,

1963
01:30:46,856 --> 01:30:50,092
after living in LA for a
while, you lose it.

1964
01:30:50,126 --> 01:30:52,660
I remember being at work
when I first got there,

1965
01:30:52,695 --> 01:30:54,096
these guys made fun of me
'cause I was like,

1966
01:30:54,130 --> 01:30:55,231
"Hi, I'm Mikey."

1967
01:30:55,264 --> 01:30:57,867
And they all said,
"You sound like a dumb hick."

1968
01:30:57,900 --> 01:30:59,667
So, yeah, just lost it.

1969
01:31:00,736 --> 01:31:02,071
Well,

1970
01:31:02,104 --> 01:31:03,839
another year or so
and I'm out of here.

1971
01:31:04,974 --> 01:31:08,410
- Why wait?
- I told you. Moolah.

1972
01:31:08,444 --> 01:31:10,379
I didn't have any money
when I left.

1973
01:31:10,412 --> 01:31:14,283
I have no friends.
No connections.

1974
01:31:14,316 --> 01:31:17,386
I'll be your friend.
I'll be your connection.

1975
01:31:17,419 --> 01:31:18,921
Don't fuck with me.

1976
01:31:19,321 --> 01:31:20,189
I'm not.

1977
01:31:38,474 --> 01:31:40,743
- This is nice.
- Mm-hmm.

1978
01:31:41,777 --> 01:31:44,213
Hold up.
I got an idea.

1979
01:31:48,450 --> 01:31:49,919
Whoa,
what are you doing?

1980
01:31:49,952 --> 01:31:53,255
Let's shoot a scene, for us.
Just for us.

1981
01:31:55,291 --> 01:31:58,160
All right, but if we do that,
we're using my phone.

1982
01:31:59,128 --> 01:32:00,362
Why, you don't trust me?

1983
01:32:00,396 --> 01:32:03,132
Well, you could lose
your phone, motherfucker.

1984
01:32:03,165 --> 01:32:05,234
You could lose your phone,
motherfucker.

1985
01:32:05,267 --> 01:32:08,270
- Well, then it would be on me.
- Mm, true dat.

1986
01:32:10,072 --> 01:32:11,440
Look at that, look at that.

1987
01:32:11,473 --> 01:32:13,909
You see that, you see
how good you look?

1988
01:32:15,277 --> 01:32:18,080
You film here, take it.
Take it.

1989
01:32:18,113 --> 01:32:19,949
Mm-hmm.

1990
01:32:19,982 --> 01:32:21,383
Yeah.

1991
01:32:26,021 --> 01:32:28,290
- That's so hot.
- I know.

1992
01:32:28,324 --> 01:32:30,159
You're telling me.

1993
01:32:30,192 --> 01:32:32,061
Look at that,
look at that,

1994
01:32:32,094 --> 01:32:34,196
you know how to play to
the camera and everything.

1995
01:32:35,898 --> 01:32:38,767
You see how you make sure
your face is always seen

1996
01:32:38,801 --> 01:32:40,102
and you're aware
of the camera?

1997
01:32:41,303 --> 01:32:43,939
That's skill right there.
That's crazy.

1998
01:32:45,107 --> 01:32:47,243
If this doesn't show you
that you can be a star,

1999
01:32:47,276 --> 01:32:49,245
I don't know what will.

2000
01:32:49,278 --> 01:32:51,413
- You really think so?
- I know so.

2001
01:32:52,147 --> 01:32:53,482
Hmm.

2002
01:32:53,515 --> 01:32:55,884
I'm not into that
swinger stuff though.

2003
01:32:57,086 --> 01:32:58,554
- Swinger stuff?
- Yeah.

2004
01:32:58,587 --> 01:33:00,456
I like fucking you,

2005
01:33:00,489 --> 01:33:02,324
and I don't want to fuck
anybody else.

2006
01:33:02,358 --> 01:33:05,427
And I don't want to think
about you fucking other girls.

2007
01:33:06,595 --> 01:33:08,797
It'll be just us.

2008
01:33:08,831 --> 01:33:11,033
It's called
"couple scenes."

2009
01:33:11,066 --> 01:33:13,335
It'll be exclusive,
just me and you.

2010
01:33:13,369 --> 01:33:16,038
Getting paid to do
what we just did.

2011
01:33:16,071 --> 01:33:17,940
Shit, you would
have made $2,000

2012
01:33:17,973 --> 01:33:20,175
- for that video right there.
- Mm.

2013
01:33:20,209 --> 01:33:22,211
- How many times did you come?
- Three times.

2014
01:33:22,244 --> 01:33:25,414
You would have been paid two
grand to come three times.

2015
01:33:25,447 --> 01:33:26,482
I'm not
that good at math,

2016
01:33:26,515 --> 01:33:28,117
but that's
a really good deal.

2017
01:33:30,085 --> 01:33:32,221
I have to
sleep on it,

2018
01:33:32,254 --> 01:33:34,523
but it's not like I don't
already have the porn star name.

2019
01:33:34,556 --> 01:33:36,358
Right?

2020
01:33:39,461 --> 01:33:40,462
You play?

2021
01:33:41,163 --> 01:33:42,831
No, I eat off of it.

2022
01:33:42,865 --> 01:33:44,166
- You're such a smart-ass.
- Yeah.

2023
01:33:44,199 --> 01:33:46,402
Yeah, since I was six.

2024
01:33:48,404 --> 01:33:50,039
You going
to play me something?

2025
01:33:50,072 --> 01:33:52,308
- Gonna make me?
- Mm-hmm. Hmm.

2026
01:33:52,341 --> 01:33:53,409
Okay.

So...

2045
01:35:36,111 --> 01:35:37,279
Where were you?

2046
01:35:40,249 --> 01:35:42,985
I texted you.
I was gone for the weekend.

2047
01:35:44,553 --> 01:35:46,555
I know.

2048
01:35:51,260 --> 01:35:53,095
That's not my question.

2049
01:35:54,496 --> 01:35:55,597
Where were you?

2050
01:35:58,500 --> 01:36:00,068
You serious right now?

2051
01:36:00,102 --> 01:36:01,570
Yeah,
I'm fuckin' serious.

2052
01:36:02,772 --> 01:36:03,740
I was in this
cute little town

2053
01:36:03,773 --> 01:36:05,674
called none of your
fuckin' business Texas.

2054
01:36:05,708 --> 01:36:07,543
How about
that's where I was.

2055
01:36:07,576 --> 01:36:09,044
- Oh, were ya?
- Yeah.

2056
01:36:10,012 --> 01:36:11,213
That sounds like
a lot of fun.

2057
01:36:11,246 --> 01:36:12,548
I hope you had
a good fuckin' time!

2058
01:36:15,117 --> 01:36:17,386
What the fuck was that, huh?
Huh? Huh?

2059
01:36:17,419 --> 01:36:18,454
Get your fuckin' hands
off me!

2060
01:36:18,487 --> 01:36:20,355
Hey, Lil,
come get your daughter!

2061
01:36:20,389 --> 01:36:22,458
- Huh?
- Mikey, go fuck yourself!

2062
01:36:22,491 --> 01:36:24,660
Okay. Look!
Look! Look! Look!

2063
01:36:26,228 --> 01:36:28,063
I was makin' us
money, okay?

2064
01:36:28,096 --> 01:36:31,166
I had to go down to Corpus
Christi to pick up some shit.

2065
01:36:31,200 --> 01:36:33,268
- For us!
- Oh, I don't believe you!

2066
01:36:33,302 --> 01:36:34,670
- You don't believe me?
- I don't fuckin' believe you!

2067
01:36:34,704 --> 01:36:36,171
You don't believe me?

2068
01:36:37,105 --> 01:36:39,074
Huh?

2069
01:36:39,107 --> 01:36:41,677
Four weeks ago,
I had zip, huh.

2070
01:36:41,711 --> 01:36:44,246
Now I got 3K!
Look at it!

2071
01:36:44,279 --> 01:36:45,280
Give me a fucking break!

2072
01:36:45,314 --> 01:36:47,082
When was the last time
you had money like that

2073
01:36:47,115 --> 01:36:48,250
under your
fucking roof, huh?

2074
01:36:48,283 --> 01:36:50,787
Now, if you want me to keep
paying for rent and food,

2075
01:36:50,820 --> 01:36:52,354
shut the fuck up!

2076
01:36:52,387 --> 01:36:54,323
And I'm not cleaning
that shit up, either!

2077
01:37:04,099 --> 01:37:07,035
She's in, man.
She's fuckin' in!

2078
01:37:07,069 --> 01:37:08,337
- Yeah? She's in?
- Yeah.

2079
01:37:08,370 --> 01:37:10,639
I'm still ironing out
the details, but guaranteed,

2080
01:37:10,672 --> 01:37:13,642
I'll have her shooting scenes
by September, baby!

2081
01:37:13,675 --> 01:37:15,511
That's pretty impressive
though, man.

2082
01:37:15,544 --> 01:37:18,046
Three weeks, you convinced
a girl to do porn?

2083
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:20,115
Like, what the fuck.

2084
01:37:20,148 --> 01:37:21,784
I couldn't convince
my first girlfriend

2085
01:37:21,818 --> 01:37:24,353
to give me a blowjob
for three fucking years.

2086
01:37:24,386 --> 01:37:25,521
Hey, man,

2087
01:37:25,554 --> 01:37:29,625
what can I say, baby,
I'm good at what I do. Ha-ha!

2088
01:37:29,658 --> 01:37:31,493
So that means
you're going to be leaving?

2089
01:37:31,527 --> 01:37:33,362
Yeah, I'm leaving.

2090
01:37:33,395 --> 01:37:35,597
Well, when are you leaving?

2091
01:37:35,631 --> 01:37:37,432
Basically,
I need enough to float us

2092
01:37:37,466 --> 01:37:38,667
until she starts shootin'.

2093
01:37:38,701 --> 01:37:41,436
I'm thinkin' I could have that
by the end of August, easy.

2094
01:37:41,470 --> 01:37:43,639
Dude, it's going to suck
for you to go.

2095
01:37:43,672 --> 01:37:45,374
I know, man,
it's going to suck

2096
01:37:45,407 --> 01:37:47,342
not hanging with you,
anymore, Lonnie.

2097
01:37:47,376 --> 01:37:49,344
You're my guy!
But, dude,

2098
01:37:49,378 --> 01:37:50,747
I'm on top of my game
right now,

2099
01:37:50,780 --> 01:37:52,782
on, like, every single
possible level.

2100
01:37:52,815 --> 01:37:55,350
Physical stamina,
my mind is sharp.

2101
01:37:55,384 --> 01:37:56,318
Now that I'm making money,

2102
01:37:56,351 --> 01:37:59,121
I'm taking 5-HTP
for serotonin in my brain.

2103
01:37:59,154 --> 01:38:01,290
Dude,
with my skill and ability

2104
01:38:01,323 --> 01:38:02,624
and my eidetic memory shit,

2105
01:38:02,658 --> 01:38:04,259
there's no denying
what I could do.

2106
01:38:04,293 --> 01:38:06,328
The universe
is on my side, bro.

2107
01:38:06,361 --> 01:38:07,429
Yeah?

2108
01:38:07,462 --> 01:38:10,332
Saber Entertainment's
first signed contract girl.

2109
01:38:10,365 --> 01:38:12,301
Strawberry!
Huh? You like that?

2110
01:38:12,334 --> 01:38:13,302
I do, yeah.

2111
01:38:13,335 --> 01:38:15,537
Just Strawberry.
No need for anything fancy,

2112
01:38:15,571 --> 01:38:17,306
all the biggest celebrities
have one name.

2113
01:38:17,339 --> 01:38:18,708
Cher. Prince. Madonna.

2114
01:38:18,741 --> 01:38:20,843
Ooh, I'm getting a LLC
for Saber Entertainment.

2115
01:38:20,877 --> 01:38:23,378
- Yeah?
- I had a DBA for Mikey Saber,

2116
01:38:23,412 --> 01:38:26,114
but, uh, I didn't pay my annual
fees, so it expired,

2117
01:38:26,148 --> 01:38:28,283
and I had a falling out
with my old business partner.

2118
01:38:28,317 --> 01:38:30,419
But I do have
Mike Saber trademarked.

2119
01:38:30,452 --> 01:38:31,587
- That's cool.
- Yeah.

2120
01:38:31,620 --> 01:38:33,756
Oh, it's going to be a big
announcement at AdultCon, bro.

2121
01:38:33,790 --> 01:38:35,624
- Yeah?
- Yeah, dude.

2122
01:38:35,657 --> 01:38:36,859
You know what,
this small-town life,

2123
01:38:36,893 --> 01:38:37,994
it just ain't for me, man.

2124
01:38:38,027 --> 01:38:40,797
No offense. But, like,
I'm a big-city guy, you know.

2125
01:38:40,830 --> 01:38:42,799
Dude, if you want, I can
hook you up with Leondria

2126
01:38:42,832 --> 01:38:44,333
so you can have
my clientele.

2127
01:38:44,366 --> 01:38:45,567
- Hell yeah!
- Yeah.

2128
01:38:45,601 --> 01:38:47,369
I just don't want you
selling fuckin' flags

2129
01:38:47,402 --> 01:38:48,705
for the rest of your life,
you know what I mean?

2130
01:38:48,738 --> 01:38:49,806
Oh, here's the exit
right here, bro!

2131
01:38:49,839 --> 01:38:52,674
Fuck! Shit! What the fuck!

2132
01:38:52,709 --> 01:38:54,576
Dude, we're fucked,
dude, we're fucked!

2133
01:38:54,610 --> 01:38:56,178
I fuckin' know, man.

2134
01:38:56,211 --> 01:38:57,814
We're fucked!
We're fucked!

2135
01:38:57,847 --> 01:38:59,247
Oh, my God, Lonnie,

2136
01:38:59,281 --> 01:39:01,450
why'd you fuckin' pull off
like that, man?

2137
01:39:01,483 --> 01:39:02,517
I didn't do
anything, man,

2138
01:39:02,551 --> 01:39:03,585
I just fuckin'
took the turn

2139
01:39:03,619 --> 01:39:05,520
like you fuckin'
asked me to, man!

2140
01:39:05,554 --> 01:39:07,522
Stop the car, man.
Stop the fucking car.

2141
01:39:07,556 --> 01:39:09,692
Stop the fucking car! Stop!

2142
01:39:11,493 --> 01:39:12,628
Where you going?

2143
01:39:14,363 --> 01:39:16,198
Crap! Fuck!

2144
01:39:18,433 --> 01:39:20,369
Listen. Listen!

2145
01:39:21,236 --> 01:39:22,537
Asshole, look at me.

2146
01:39:24,506 --> 01:39:25,908
I was never with you.

2147
01:39:25,942 --> 01:39:28,543
You don't know me.
I don't know you.

2148
01:39:28,577 --> 01:39:30,880
This never happened.
Are you listening to me?

2149
01:39:30,913 --> 01:39:31,948
What are we going to do?

2150
01:39:31,981 --> 01:39:34,717
"We"? You did this,
not me!

2151
01:39:34,751 --> 01:39:36,618
Look at me, you don't know me.
Say it. Say it.

2152
01:39:36,652 --> 01:39:38,186
You don't know me, say it.

2153
01:39:38,220 --> 01:39:40,489
I don't know you, man.

2154
01:39:40,522 --> 01:39:41,691
Fuck!

2155
01:39:47,329 --> 01:39:49,699
Jesus Christ!
What the fuck, Mikey!

2156
01:39:49,732 --> 01:39:51,166
Fuck.

2157
01:40:02,411 --> 01:40:03,478
Mikey?

2158
01:40:03,512 --> 01:40:04,714
- Yeah, no, I'm fine.
- You okay?

2159
01:40:04,747 --> 01:40:05,782
Yeah, I'm okay,
thanks.

2160
01:40:05,815 --> 01:40:06,883
You scared
the shit out of me.

2161
01:40:06,916 --> 01:40:07,850
I know.
I just don't feel good.

2162
01:40:07,884 --> 01:40:10,385
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Yup, thank you.

2163
01:40:20,963 --> 01:40:21,864
<i>According to authorities,</i>

2164

get out of here.

2320
01:47:46,008 --> 01:47:49,311
That shit that happened on
146, that was a sign.

2321
01:47:49,345 --> 01:47:51,380
To do what makes
you happy today.

2322
01:47:51,413 --> 01:47:53,916
Because there might
not be a tomorrow.

2323
01:47:54,850 --> 01:47:57,019
Look, I want you
to celebrate

2324
01:47:57,052 --> 01:47:59,989
your 18th birthday
in LA with me.

2325
01:48:00,022 --> 01:48:02,458
I want you to follow your
destiny, and I wanna be

2326
01:48:02,491 --> 01:48:05,794
right there next to you
to help you follow it.

2327
01:48:05,828 --> 01:48:06,962
So what do you say?

2328
01:48:08,063 --> 01:48:09,331
Let's start
a new life together

2329
01:48:09,365 --> 01:48:12,801
and get the fuck outta this
dead-end shit-hole town, okay?

2330
01:48:12,835 --> 01:48:14,737
Do you mean, like, now?

2331
01:48:14,770 --> 01:48:16,338
Well, we'll leave tomorrow

2332
01:48:16,372 --> 01:48:18,807
and we'll be in LA
by Monday, babe.

2333
01:48:18,841 --> 01:48:21,143
Oh, my God! Mikey!

2334
01:48:21,177 --> 01:48:23,379
- I think I'm dreaming!
- Me, too!

2335
01:48:25,781 --> 01:48:27,483
Ms. Phan,
I have to quit.

2336
01:48:27,516 --> 01:48:30,452
I love you guys,
but I'm going to LA with Mikey.

2337
01:48:36,492 --> 01:48:38,761
Thank you for all the free
donuts, Ms. Phan.

2338
01:48:45,301 --> 01:48:47,803
So we're gonna
leave at 10:00 a.m., okay?

2339
01:48:47,836 --> 01:48:50,206
I'm gonna get a car,
I'm gonna pick you up...

2340
01:48:50,239 --> 01:48:52,341
- You got a car?
- Oh, I mean get a taxi.

2341
01:48:52,374 --> 01:48:53,976
I'm gonna have
a taxi pick us up

2342
01:48:54,009 --> 01:48:55,211
and take us
to the station,

2343
01:48:55,244 --> 01:48:58,180
and we're taking a bus
to Hollywood, baby.

2344
01:48:58,981 --> 01:49:00,449
- Okay.
- So just be packed

2345
01:49:00,482 --> 01:49:02,384
and ready to go at 10:00,
but just bring one bag,

2346
01:49:02,418 --> 01:49:03,452
'cause when we get to LA,

2347
01:49:03,485 --> 01:49:05,321
we're going to buy
all new shit.

2348
01:49:08,390 --> 01:49:10,059
- Mikey?
- Yeah?

2349
01:49:12,061 --> 01:49:13,329
You make me so happy.

2350
01:49:24,373 --> 01:49:25,474
- Hey.
- Hey.

2351
01:49:28,911 --> 01:49:29,945
Mm-hmm.

2352
01:49:40,022 --> 01:49:42,091
- Is Lil here? She's...
- She's sleeping.

2353
01:49:53,302 --> 01:49:55,504
Uh...

2354
01:49:58,507 --> 01:50:00,009
It's been
a crazy month, huh?

2355
01:50:00,876 --> 01:50:02,511
Sure has.

2356
01:50:02,544 --> 01:50:03,579
Poor Lonnie.

2357
01:50:03,612 --> 01:50:05,414
- Oh, God, so sad.
- So fucked up.

2358
01:50:07,249 --> 01:50:09,518
- I hope he's all right.
- Yeah, me, too.

2359
01:50:12,021 --> 01:50:13,022
Uh...

2360
01:50:14,390 --> 01:50:16,492
Yeah, it's just
been so wild,

2361
01:50:16,525 --> 01:50:18,260
we've been fighting
and all that stuff.

2362
01:50:20,929 --> 01:50:21,930
Yeah.

2363
01:50:23,132 --> 01:50:24,867
I'm not...
I'm not really in the mood.

2364
01:50:24,900 --> 01:50:26,035
Huh?

2365
01:50:26,068 --> 01:50:27,603
I'm not really in the mood
to mess around.

2366
01:50:27,636 --> 01:50:28,937
Oh.

2367
01:50:28,971 --> 01:50:30,205
- Yeah.
- Just saying.

2368
01:50:30,239 --> 01:50:31,340
- Okay.
- Okay.

2369
01:50:34,209 --> 01:50:35,077
Just been fighting a lot,

2370
01:50:35,110 --> 01:50:37,246
been a lot of drama
lately. And, uh...

2371
01:50:41,383 --> 01:50:43,185
We don't want to fight,
you know what I mean.

2372
01:50:44,920 --> 01:50:46,855
I know you don't want that.
I don't want that.

2373
01:50:50,292 --> 01:50:51,293
So...

2374
01:50:52,227 --> 01:50:53,228
Yeah.

2375
01:50:56,231 --> 01:50:57,433
Look, I'm...

2376
01:50:59,335 --> 01:51:00,369
I'm just gonna tell ya,

2377
01:51:00,402 --> 01:51:02,404
I'm going back to
California in the morning.

2378
01:51:06,442 --> 01:51:07,476
So...

2379
01:51:12,281 --> 01:51:13,582
- I mean...
- You're going back

2380
01:51:13,615 --> 01:51:15,317
- to California.
- Yeah.

2381
01:51:16,518 --> 01:51:17,953
I got some work,

2382
01:51:19,254 --> 01:51:21,223
so that's good.
And...

2383
01:51:22,524 --> 01:51:23,959
Uh...

2384
01:51:26,328 --> 01:51:29,665
You know, this has not
been going good with us.

2385
01:51:29,699 --> 01:51:32,134
It's so much drama,
throwing coffee pots.

2386
01:51:32,167 --> 01:51:34,269
We don't need that,
you know. And...

2387
01:51:35,304 --> 01:51:37,072
But this has been fun.

2388
01:51:37,106 --> 01:51:38,607
You know, we had some good times.
I know...

2389
01:51:41,977 --> 01:51:43,479
Just feels like, uh...

2390
01:51:43,512 --> 01:51:46,348
Just feels like it's time to
go, you know?

2391
01:51:46,382 --> 01:51:49,585
I'm sure Lil's ready for me to go.
I...

2392
01:51:51,688 --> 01:51:52,888
Yeah.

2393
01:51:56,525 --> 01:51:57,559
I don't want
to fight with you,

2394
01:51:57,593 --> 01:51:58,627
you know what I mean,

2395
01:51:58,660 --> 01:52:00,596
but we had good times,
as always.

2396
01:52:00,629 --> 01:52:03,232
And thank you
for the hospitality.

2397
01:52:04,566 --> 01:52:07,136
It's been great.
So...

2398
01:52:09,972 --> 01:52:11,974
You know, I wanted to
tell you and Lil together,

2399
01:52:12,007 --> 01:52:14,476
but I guess I could just
tell her in the morning,

2400
01:52:14,510 --> 01:52:16,713
before I go.
Or if I...

2401
01:52:16,746 --> 01:52:18,447
I don't see her,
I can...

2402
01:52:18,480 --> 01:52:21,049
I'll call her or something,
and thank her. But...

2403
01:52:24,553 --> 01:52:25,954
So I'm gonna go to bed.

2404
01:52:35,197 --> 01:52:37,032
Okay? We're good?

2405
01:52:37,700 --> 01:52:38,967
You understand.

2406
01:54:58,741 --> 01:55:01,276
Aw, look at
this cutie pie.

2407
01:55:01,310 --> 01:55:02,377
Aw.

2408
01:55:02,411 --> 01:55:03,713
Hey, yo, B,
hit the light.

2409
01:55:03,746 --> 01:55:05,447
Wakey-wakey,
eggs and bakey!

2410
01:55:06,883 --> 01:55:09,651
- Yo!
- Ahh! Ah, what the fuck!

2411
01:55:11,253 --> 01:55:12,421
Oh, look out, it's me!

2412
01:55:12,454 --> 01:55:14,356
Look at this scared
motherfucker, man.

2413
01:55:14,389 --> 01:55:15,725
June?

2414
01:55:16,391 --> 01:55:17,659
It's me, homeboy.

2415
01:55:17,694 --> 01:55:18,861
- What the fuck?
- That's right.

2416
01:55:20,362 --> 01:55:22,464
What...
What are you doing here?

2417
01:55:22,497 --> 01:55:24,499
Money. Weed.

2418
01:55:24,533 --> 01:55:26,803
Get your shit
and get the fuck out!

2419
01:55:26,836 --> 01:55:28,403
June, what the fuck,
I'm good with your mama.

2420
01:55:28,437 --> 01:55:29,671
What are you talking about?
I'm not giving you shit.

2421
01:55:29,706 --> 01:55:32,207
You good with my mama?
Yeah, nah. See...

2422
01:55:32,240 --> 01:55:34,343
This is your eviction
notice, Mikey.

2423
01:55:34,376 --> 01:55:35,878
I don't think
you got the message.

2424
01:55:35,912 --> 01:55:37,714
No, wait, what the fuck
are you talking about?

2425
01:55:37,747 --> 01:55:39,548
- I'm good with your mama...
- She sent us here.

2426
01:55:39,581 --> 01:55:41,283
Give me my phone,
I'm calling Leondria.

2427
01:55:41,316 --> 01:55:42,551
That shit's not an option.

2428
01:55:42,584 --> 01:55:43,485
Where the hell
the money at?

2429
01:55:43,518 --> 01:55:44,787
No, fuck you,
I'm not giving you shit!

2430
01:55:44,821 --> 01:55:45,688
- Fuck me?
- I'm not telling you

2431
01:55:45,722 --> 01:55:47,656
- where my fucking money is.
- Fuck me?

2432
01:55:47,690 --> 01:55:49,391
- It's under the mattress!
- Yo, go ahead.

2433
01:55:51,460 --> 01:55:52,795
What the hell
are you doing?

2434
01:55:52,829 --> 01:55:54,563
- Damn!
- What the fuck!

2435
01:55:54,596 --> 01:55:55,832
- What are you doing, man?
- What the fuck, man!

2436
01:55:55,865 --> 01:55:56,899
Motherfucker's naked!

2437
01:55:56,933 --> 01:55:58,701
The money's
under the mattress!

2438
01:55:58,735 --> 01:56:00,703
Shut the fuck up!
What are you doing? No!

2439
01:56:00,737 --> 01:56:02,170
On the other side,
it's under the mattress.

2440
01:56:02,204 --> 01:56:03,106
Go and get that, B.

2441
01:56:03,138 --> 01:56:05,173
This motherfucker
is layin' on the bed.

2442
01:56:05,207 --> 01:56:06,375
Get that money!
Get that money!

2443
01:56:06,408 --> 01:56:07,442
What are you doing?

2444
01:56:07,476 --> 01:56:08,677
I'm sorry, Mikey.

2445
01:56:08,711 --> 01:56:10,646
Don't! Stop! Stop!

2446
01:56:13,448 --> 01:56:15,752
That's my money!
Hey, that's my fuckin' money!

2447
01:56:15,785 --> 01:56:16,819
What are you doing?

2448
01:56:16,853 --> 01:56:17,887
Look, I was gonna
leave tomorrow,

2449
01:56:17,920 --> 01:56:19,521
give me that shit back.
Come on, June. Be cool.

2450
01:56:19,554 --> 01:56:20,690
- I want you out tonight.
- Oh, fuck you, Lil!

2451
01:56:20,723 --> 01:56:21,958
I don't give
a fuck about you!

2452
01:56:21,991 --> 01:56:22,925
- Yeah fuck you!
- I don't give a fuck

2453
01:56:22,959 --> 01:56:25,193
about nothin' that
they got goin' on over here.

2454
01:56:25,227 --> 01:56:26,461
I'm here
for a motherfuckin' job.

2455
01:56:26,495 --> 01:56:27,964
- Give me that shit back!
- Get your ass back!

2456
01:56:27,997 --> 01:56:29,899
- What are you doing?
- Thank you so much.

2457
01:56:29,932 --> 01:56:30,967
Get dressed, man!

2458
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:32,601
I see, you bitches played me.

2459
01:56:32,634 --> 01:56:33,568
Look at all this money...

2460
01:56:33,602 --> 01:56:36,271
Oh, this is fuckin' great!
This is just great!

2461
01:56:36,304 --> 01:56:37,840
- Fuck you!
- So much fuckin' money!

2462
01:56:37,874 --> 01:56:39,842
I can't believe she called me
over here for this shit, man!

2463
01:56:39,876 --> 01:56:41,243
Fuck you,
I paid for August rent!

2464
01:56:41,276 --> 01:56:42,310
Give me some of that back!

2465
01:56:42,344 --> 01:56:43,512
Now give me my mom weed,
homeboy!

2466
01:56:43,545 --> 01:56:44,981
I'm not telling you
where the weed's at!

2467
01:56:45,014 --> 01:56:46,049
I'mma fuck you up!

2468
01:56:46,082 --> 01:56:47,482
You got my money,
you're not getting my weed!

2469
01:56:47,516 --> 01:56:48,650
It's right over there
actually.

2470
01:56:48,685 --> 01:56:49,518
You fuckin' bitch!

2471
01:56:49,551 --> 01:56:51,386
Ernesto, you get...

2472
01:56:51,420 --> 01:56:52,889
- God...
- Oh, it's so hot

2473
01:56:52,922 --> 01:56:55,457
in here. Ma, are you hot?
Oh, Ma, it's so hot.

2474
01:56:55,490 --> 01:56:56,425
I'll fucking lunge kick
you and your mom!

2475
01:56:56,458 --> 01:56:58,593
Oh, will you?
You got a green belt?

2476
01:56:58,627 --> 01:56:59,661
You gonna do
some of those moves?

2477
01:56:59,696 --> 01:57:01,396
- Fuck you, bitch!
- Shut the fuck up!

2478
01:57:01,430 --> 01:57:03,766
- Relax, Ernesto!
- Get him out, guys.

2479
01:57:03,800 --> 01:57:04,633
Now get your shit
and get out.

2480
01:57:04,666 --> 01:57:05,600
That's right.
It's time to go.

2481
01:57:05,634 --> 01:57:07,335
And don't even
think about stepping foot

2482
01:57:07,369 --> 01:57:09,371
in Texas City again.
You got me?

2483
01:57:09,404 --> 01:57:11,808
Ain't no lie, baby,
bye, bye, bye.

2484
01:57:13,009 --> 01:57:14,242
Can I put my clothes on,
please,

2485
01:57:14,276 --> 01:57:15,310
can you just
give me some privacy

2486
01:57:15,343 --> 01:57:16,478
so I can put
my clothes on, please?

2487
01:57:16,511 --> 01:57:18,915
You got 30 motherfuckin'
seconds, homeboy.

2488
01:57:18,948 --> 01:57:20,783
Thirty seconds
'cause you wasting my time.

2489
01:57:20,817 --> 01:57:21,718
Okay.

2490
01:57:21,751 --> 01:57:22,719
That's less
than a minute, Mikey.

2491
01:57:22,752 --> 01:57:24,553
Yeah,
I'll give you less than a minute.

2492
01:57:24,586 --> 01:57:25,554
Less than
a motherfuckin' minute.

2493
01:57:25,587 --> 01:57:27,422
I'll give you
less than a fuckin' minute.

2494
01:57:27,456 --> 01:57:29,491
Thirty seconds
starts now.

2495
01:57:29,524 --> 01:57:31,326
- You hear me? 30 seconds.
- Yup.

2496
01:57:31,359 --> 01:57:33,395
Thank you. All right,
let me get changed. Jesus.

2497
01:57:33,428 --> 01:57:34,463
Motherfucker.

2498
01:57:34,496 --> 01:57:36,331
Look at
all this money.

2499
01:57:36,364 --> 01:57:37,867
Hurry the the fuck up,
you nasty bitch.

2500
01:57:38,968 --> 01:57:41,037
One, two...

2501
01:57:41,070 --> 01:57:45,808
...three, four, five, six,
seven, eight,

2502
01:57:45,842 --> 01:57:47,342
nine... Thirty!

2503
01:57:51,748 --> 01:57:52,949
Oh, man.

2504
01:57:52,982 --> 01:57:54,583
Mama's gonna kill me.

2505
01:58:30,052 --> 01:58:31,854
Leondria!

2506
01:58:31,888 --> 01:58:33,823
Shit. Open up!

2507
01:58:34,489 --> 01:58:35,624
- Whoa!
- Shit.

2508
01:58:35,657 --> 01:58:36,692
- Oh!
- Okay, sorry.

2509
01:58:36,726 --> 01:58:38,728
Oh, fuck this!
What are you doing?

2510
01:58:38,761 --> 01:58:39,796
- We gotta talk.
- Where's June?

2511
01:58:39,829 --> 01:58:41,731
- What do you mean? You sent...
- Wait! I don't...

2512
01:58:41,764 --> 01:58:42,799
Listen. Go in the back.

2513
01:58:42,832 --> 01:58:44,633
Okay. Can...
Can I have a towel?

2514
01:58:44,666 --> 01:58:45,868
Hell no!
Go that way.

2515
01:58:46,903 --> 01:58:47,904
Fuck this.

2516
01:58:49,939 --> 01:58:51,373
Cover that shit up, boy.

2517
01:58:55,111 --> 01:58:56,411
Okay, look, yeah,
you want me to admit it,

2518
01:58:56,444 --> 01:58:57,579
I was selling
to the hardhats.

2519
01:58:57,612 --> 01:58:59,614
I know you told me not to,
but they're good customers.

2520
01:58:59,648 --> 01:59:01,516
They're good guys.

2521
01:59:01,550 --> 01:59:03,451
I... I...
You got their money.

2522
01:59:08,991 --> 01:59:10,126
Yes?

2523
01:59:10,159 --> 01:59:11,660
Yeah. Out back.

2524
01:59:17,432 --> 01:59:20,102
You're <i>persona non grata.</i>

2525
01:59:20,136 --> 01:59:22,370
You know what that means,
Mr. Hollywood?

2526
01:59:22,404 --> 01:59:24,539
Yes. Yes, I know what that means.
But why?

2527
01:59:24,573 --> 01:59:26,441
I'm looking out for Lil.

2528
01:59:26,474 --> 01:59:28,476
And that's all
you need to know.

2529
01:59:29,511 --> 01:59:30,847
Goddamn sabotage.

2530
01:59:31,546 --> 01:59:32,815
- Okay.
- Whatever.

2531
01:59:34,150 --> 01:59:36,118
Oh, great,
the goonette squad.

2532
01:59:36,152 --> 01:59:37,320
Look at them go.

2533
01:59:37,352 --> 01:59:39,789
All right, Ma, man,
this nigga jumped out the window.

2534
01:59:39,822 --> 01:59:41,456
Is Lil and Lexi okay?

2535
01:59:41,489 --> 01:59:42,524
They're fine.

2536
01:59:42,557 --> 01:59:43,926
Hey, man,
shut the fuck up.

2537
01:59:44,994 --> 01:59:47,029
Look, that house is crazy.

2538
01:59:47,063 --> 01:59:49,131
Everybody over there
screamin' and cryin',

2539
01:59:49,165 --> 01:59:51,834
this motherfucker with
his junk swingin' everywhere.

2540
01:59:51,868 --> 01:59:53,736
This lazy bastard
not doin' shit.

2541
01:59:53,769 --> 01:59:55,037
- Besides sittin' on your ass.
- Shit, I do a lot.

2542
01:59:55,071 --> 01:59:56,638
I showed up, man,
I'm the fuckin' muscle.

2543
01:59:56,671 --> 01:59:58,473
And your lazy ass,

2544
01:59:58,506 --> 01:59:59,742
all you did
was get the money.

2545
01:59:59,775 --> 02:00:01,177
And then
you were just watchin'.

2546
02:00:01,210 --> 02:00:02,712
Nobody told me
I was going to be draggin'

2547
02:00:02,745 --> 02:00:04,046
a freakin' butt-naked dude
out the bed.

2548
02:00:04,080 --> 02:00:05,680
Man, you ain't
even do shit, anyways.

2549
02:00:05,715 --> 02:00:07,116
I don't need you coming
on no runs with me.

2550
02:00:07,149 --> 02:00:09,118
You ain't nothin' but
deadweight, motherfucker.

2551
02:00:09,151 --> 02:00:11,153
Okay. That's cool.
It's all good.

2552
02:00:11,187 --> 02:00:12,722
Mom, you gonna
let her talk to me like that?

2553
02:00:12,755 --> 02:00:13,890
Hell yeah,
I'mma talk to you like that.

2554
02:00:13,923 --> 02:00:15,590
- Listen...
- She can't save you.

2555
02:00:15,624 --> 02:00:16,692
- Time-out.
- Okay.

2556
02:00:16,726 --> 02:00:19,394
- Lazy motherfucker.
- Time the fuck out.

2557
02:00:20,730 --> 02:00:22,497
Yeah, you guys
are on time-out.

2558
02:00:22,530 --> 02:00:24,834
- Shut up.
- Shut up, bro. Zip it.

2559
02:00:26,135 --> 02:00:27,136
Mom...

2560
02:00:28,170 --> 02:00:29,939
This incident
ruined my night.

2561
02:00:29,972 --> 02:00:31,908
One of my buddies
had a party at Oceans,

2562
02:00:31,941 --> 02:00:32,842
I could have been there.

2563
02:00:32,875 --> 02:00:34,944
But I gotta come
and deal with this bullshit!

2564
02:00:34,977 --> 02:00:35,845
You see?
Constant complaining.

2565
02:00:35,878 --> 02:00:37,545
You were there
to protect your sister.

2566
02:00:37,579 --> 02:00:39,015
He not coming
with me no more.

2567
02:00:39,048 --> 02:00:40,016
A'ight, well,
I'm done with this shit.

2568
02:00:40,049 --> 02:00:41,150
You should've
stayed your ass at home.

2569
02:00:41,183 --> 02:00:42,550
You know what?

2570
02:00:42,584 --> 02:00:44,186
We havin' a family meeting
after this.

2571
02:00:44,220 --> 02:00:46,022
- Family meeting?
- Point-blank.

2572
02:00:46,055 --> 02:00:47,223
- You serious?
- We need a meeting.

2573
02:00:47,256 --> 02:00:48,357
You can take that information

2574
02:00:48,391 --> 02:00:50,826
and do what you want with it.

2575
02:00:50,860 --> 02:00:52,762
You ain't going
to that fucked-up club.

2576
02:00:52,795 --> 02:00:53,829
You ain't goin' nowhere.

2577
02:00:53,863 --> 02:00:55,965
Homeboy, you gon' sit right
here and roll with us.

2578
02:00:55,998 --> 02:00:57,565
We need a meeting.

2579
02:00:57,599 --> 02:00:58,701
Now back to you.

2580
02:00:58,734 --> 02:01:00,468
Yeah, yeah,
back to the sabotage.

2581
02:01:00,502 --> 02:01:02,972
Whatever you wanna call it.
It's over with.

2582
02:01:03,005 --> 02:01:05,640
That was between me and Lexi.
Seriously, what the fuck.

2583
02:01:05,674 --> 02:01:06,508
At the end of the day,

2584
02:01:06,541 --> 02:01:08,677
it's about you getting up
out of Texas.

2585
02:01:08,711 --> 02:01:10,645
It's time for you
to bounce.

2586
02:01:10,679 --> 02:01:11,948
Yeah, I'm fixin' to,

2587
02:01:11,981 --> 02:01:13,816
but I was gonna leave
in the morning,

2588
02:01:13,849 --> 02:01:15,785
I need money
to do that.

2589
02:01:15,818 --> 02:01:17,887
Well, maybe you could go sell
one of your fuck trophies.

2590
02:01:17,920 --> 02:01:19,587
Hey,
watch your mouth in front of Mom.

2591
02:01:19,621 --> 02:01:20,957
What's wrong with you?

2592
02:01:20,990 --> 02:01:22,124
Did you give him his 200?

2593
02:01:22,158 --> 02:01:24,226
I was, but then his punk-ass
jumped out the window.

2594
02:01:24,260 --> 02:01:25,527
Two hundred, that's it?

2595
02:01:25,560 --> 02:01:26,862
That's enough
to get you a bus ticket

2596
02:01:26,896 --> 02:01:27,897
far beyond the state line.

2597
02:01:30,766 --> 02:01:32,735
After everything
I did for you.

2598
02:01:32,768 --> 02:01:34,170
Two hundred. Wow.

2599
02:01:35,603 --> 02:01:36,906
Be gone by midday.

2600
02:01:39,976 --> 02:01:42,544
- Thank your mom for me.
- I sure will.

2601
02:01:42,577 --> 02:01:44,847
Maybe you oughta come
by our house sometime.

2602
02:01:44,880 --> 02:01:46,015
Yeah, that would be nice.

2603
02:01:46,048 --> 02:01:47,683
Yeah, you and Lex,
y'all come on over,

2604
02:01:47,717 --> 02:01:49,018
we can, you know, barbeque,

2605
02:01:49,051 --> 02:01:50,219
- drink some beer.
- Oh, that would be great.

2606
02:01:51,721 --> 02:01:53,189
You know,
I should be taking

2607
02:01:53,222 --> 02:01:54,690
the backpack
that you gave me,

2608
02:01:54,724 --> 02:01:56,092
but, no, I'll take...
I'll use this.

2609
02:01:56,125 --> 02:01:57,226
You want me
to walk down the street

2610
02:01:57,259 --> 02:01:58,560
with a garbage bag? Fine.

2611
02:01:58,593 --> 02:01:59,795
Yeah, you should.

2612
02:01:59,829 --> 02:02:01,297
- Fuckin' bullshit.
- Like a hobo.

2613
02:02:01,330 --> 02:02:03,032
Threw my clothes in there
all fucked up,

2614
02:02:03,065 --> 02:02:03,933
I'm gonna fold my clothes

2615
02:02:03,966 --> 02:02:04,967
so when I leave,
they're not wrinkled.

2616
02:02:05,001 --> 02:02:07,136
Me and him got in a fight
about 25 years ago.

2617
02:02:07,169 --> 02:02:08,204
Really?

2618
02:02:08,237 --> 02:02:09,071
I whupped his ass
in high school.

2619
02:02:09,105 --> 02:02:11,207
- I'm sure he deserved it.
- Yeah.

2620
02:02:11,240 --> 02:02:12,174
I'm gonna take my time.

2621
02:02:12,208 --> 02:02:13,709
- Let's see how you fold.
- Yeah, watch.

2622
02:02:13,743 --> 02:02:15,111
- Oh, look at that fold...
- Oh, my God.

2623
02:02:15,144 --> 02:02:16,712
Oh, you should work
at the Gap.

2624
02:02:16,746 --> 02:02:18,247
Man, y'all get tired
of this shit, man?

2625
02:02:18,280 --> 02:02:20,216
- No, I love it.
- Y'all get tired of this shit?

2626
02:02:20,249 --> 02:02:21,817
Lil, you're
a good woman, Lil.

2627
02:02:21,851 --> 02:02:23,285
- Thank you.
- You really are.

2628
02:02:23,319 --> 02:02:24,687
Good seeing you again.

2629
02:02:24,720 --> 02:02:26,222
Fuckin' dumb bitch.
All this...

2630
02:02:26,255 --> 02:02:28,724
- Man, hurry the fuck up!
- June, relax! What the fuck!

2631
02:02:28,758 --> 02:02:29,692
That's right, hurry up.
Thank you, June!

2632
02:02:29,725 --> 02:02:31,227
- All right! Jesus.
- Get your shit, come on.

2633
02:02:33,696 --> 02:02:34,930
June!

2634
02:02:34,964 --> 02:02:37,033
There's been
a lot of drama here.

2635
02:02:37,066 --> 02:02:39,035
Oh, no, no, no,
you're not taking big stripes!

2636
02:02:39,068 --> 02:02:40,336
- Your big stripes...
- No, no!

2637
02:02:40,369 --> 02:02:42,104
I have the 64-ounce one!

2638
02:02:42,138 --> 02:02:43,806
And I took favorite shirt,
fuck you.

2639
02:02:43,839 --> 02:02:46,976
...for you, in here,
Mikey, get the fuck...

2640
02:02:47,009 --> 02:02:48,643
- Come on!
- Go sit down!

2641
02:02:48,676 --> 02:02:50,146
I'm taking my toothbrush!

2642
02:02:50,179 --> 02:02:51,646
Don't pretend
you brush your teeth.

2643
02:02:51,679 --> 02:02:53,749
- Shut up! Relax, June, damn.
- Oh, my God.

2644
02:02:53,783 --> 02:02:54,950
All right, I'm going.

2645
02:02:54,984 --> 02:02:57,820
Uh, Lil, seriously,
thank you so much for letting me stay,

2646
02:02:57,853 --> 02:02:58,821
I had an amazing time,

2647
02:02:58,854 --> 02:03:00,622
and you and your daughter
are dumb bitches.

2648
02:03:00,655 --> 02:03:01,991
- Don't say that.
- Piece of shit.

2649
02:03:02,024 --> 02:03:02,925
That is not right.

2650
02:03:02,958 --> 02:03:03,826
- Get the fuck out!
- I gotta get water

2651
02:03:03,859 --> 02:03:05,728
before I leave
'cause I'm gonna be thirsty!

2652
02:03:05,761 --> 02:03:06,594
You gotta go, man.

2653
02:03:06,628 --> 02:03:08,697
I bought this.
I bought this ashtray!

2654
02:03:08,731 --> 02:03:10,900
No, I said when I
got, I can take it back.

2655
02:03:10,933 --> 02:03:12,034
- Hey, let's go.
- You did not!

2656
02:03:12,068 --> 02:03:13,601
- There's no take-backs!
- Fine. Fine.

2657
02:03:13,635 --> 02:03:14,537
Get outta here, man.

2658
02:03:14,569 --> 02:03:16,604
I should have beat your ass
in high school.

2659
02:03:16,638 --> 02:03:18,074
Too bad it was the
other way around, huh?

2660
02:03:18,107 --> 02:03:19,641
- Yeah.
- You want to go another round?

2661
02:03:19,674 --> 02:03:21,710
Nah. You know what?

2662
02:03:21,744 --> 02:03:23,746
I got one last thing
to say to all you guys.

2663
02:03:23,779 --> 02:03:25,247
- Man, shut your bitch-ass up.
- Shut up!

2664
02:03:25,281 --> 02:03:26,816
- Shut the fuck up.
- Leave.

2665
02:03:26,849 --> 02:03:28,751
Not another word out
of your mouth!

2666
02:03:30,352 --> 02:03:33,089
Now get the fuck out,
you suitcase pimp.

2667
02:03:34,056 --> 02:03:35,057
What'd you say?

2668
02:03:36,258 --> 02:03:39,728
You heard me.
Suitcase pimp.

2669
02:03:40,396 --> 02:03:41,931
Say that shit again.

2670
02:03:41,964 --> 02:03:45,768
Homeless suitcase pimp.

2671
02:03:48,804 --> 02:03:49,805
Hmm.

2672
02:03:53,976 --> 02:03:55,277
Just go ahead
and leave, dude.

2673
02:04:00,783 --> 02:04:01,784
What the...

2674
02:04:03,452 --> 02:04:05,387
- He's outta here, babe.
- He's outta here.

2675
02:04:05,421 --> 02:04:07,123
No more.

2676
02:04:07,156 --> 02:04:09,425
Ah, that was
nothin' but trouble.

2677
02:06:58,646 --> 02:07:03,646
