00:01:17,166 --> 00:01:20,958
Adapted from the Ming novel, The Investiture of the Gods,
and the Song/Yuan script, King Zhou's Attack of the Shang

4
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:39,000
At the beginning of time, the world was shapeless.

5
00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:42,250
Separating the sky and earth,

6
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:45,000
Pangu turned his body into the sun, the moon, the mountains
and the rivers,

7
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,291
and the world was thus created.

8
00:01:50,208 --> 00:01:52,208
Nuwa made figurines out of clay,

9
00:01:52,208 --> 00:01:54,916
imparting her own spirit to give them life,

10
00:01:55,416 --> 00:01:57,916
and humans were thus created.

11
00:02:00,708 --> 00:02:03,916
Before she died, Nuwa left behind a sacred artifact,

12
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:06,708
called the “Fengshen Bang”,

13
00:02:07,708 --> 00:02:10,166
and appointed the Immortals of Kunlun to guard it.

14
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,125
It had the power to save the world...

15
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:17,375
...and could only be opened by the King of All Realms.

16
00:02:19,916 --> 00:02:21,875
As the generations came and went,

17
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:24,250
Cheng Tang established the Shang Dynasty.

18
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,500
The Four Dukes of the East, West, South and North,

19
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,708
together with the 800 Lords under them,

20
00:02:29,708 --> 00:02:33,750
acknowledged the Shang monarch as the King of All Realms.

21
00:02:34,541 --> 00:02:35,833
But there came a time,

22
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:38,875
500 years into the reign of the Shang,

23
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:43,041
Su Hu, Lord of Jizhou, refused to submit his tribute...

24
00:02:43,791 --> 00:02:46,583
...and rebelled against the Shang‘s King Yi.

25
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:50,875
After a long and bitter siege,

26
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:54,875
King Yi sent his second son, Yin Shou, into battle.

27
00:02:55,958 --> 00:03:02,666
Yin Shou led a special force trained by his own hand.

28
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:30,291
I am Ji Fa, son of Ji Chang, Duke of the West.

29
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:35,000
Riding by my side is my best friend, Yin Jiao.

30
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:40,958
His father is our commander and hero.

31
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:45,958
One day I hope to become just like him.

32
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:06,750
State your name.

33
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,500
Su Quanxiao, son of Su Hu,

34
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:09,750
Lord of Jizhou.

35
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:12,458
Louder, so they can hear you.

36
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:19,541
Su Quanxiao, son of Su Hu,

37
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,583
Lord of Jizhou.

38
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:22,708
State your rank.

39
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:25,708
Centurion of the Shang Hostage Brigade,

40
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:27,333
North Battalion.

41
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:29,291
Tell us why you’re a “hostage”.

42
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:31,708
The 800 Lords...

43
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:35,625
...of the East, West, South and North are required to send
one of their sons...

44
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:37,166
...to be hostages of the Shang court.

45
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:39,583
If any Lord plots against the King,

46
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:41,625
his hostage son is to be executed first,

47
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:43,875
followed by his entire family.

48
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:48,375
Your father Su Hu has led Jizhou in rebellion.

49
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:52,916
Go talk some sense into him.

50
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:12,916
Father! Please surrender!

51
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:10,166
I’ve been away for eight years.

52
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,750
I’ve grown up.

53
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:16,875
My father doesn't recognize me.

54
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:20,166
That man doesn't deserve to be your father.

55
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:27,208
You are my son.

56
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:33,458
And now, you have to be my bravest son.

57
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:47,125
Farewell,

58
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:50,750
Father!

59
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:19,791
Just now,

60
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,875
right before your eyes,

61
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:25,125
one of your brothers died!

62
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,083
One of my sons died!

63
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:30,916
Who killed him?

64
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:32,916
The traitor Su Hu!

65
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:34,875
Who was it that killed him?

66
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:36,416
The traitor Su Hu!

67
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:38,875
Who was it that killed him?

68
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:40,458
The traitor Su Hu!

69
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:42,375
The traitor Su Hu!

70
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:44,375
The traitor Su Hu!

71
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:45,250
Fire!

72
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:35,666
Warriors of Shang...

73
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:37,708
annihilate Jizhou!

74
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:42,250
Annihilate Jizhou!

75
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:48,541
Attack!

76
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:50,583
Ji Fa, come on!

77
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:54,416
Watch out!

78
00:09:58,375 --> 00:09:59,208
Attack!

79
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:00,375
Fire!

80
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:20,500
Attack!

81
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:23,416
Into the breach!

82
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:36,541
Attack!

83
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:49,458
Make way!

84
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:36,250
Ji Fa!

85
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:39,375
Ji Fa!

86
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:48,750
Yin Jiao,

87
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,625
you retreated in fear.

88
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:51,708
You’re such a disappointment.

89
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:52,750
Forgive me, Father!

90
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,125
Sir,

91
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:55,708
It wasn’t us!

92
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:58,416
The horses bolted when they saw the fire.

93
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,166
Father!

94
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:09,250
The horses see what we allow them to see!

95
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:15,541
Faster!

96
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:26,291
Attack!

97
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:33,041
Attack!

98
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:36,416
Attack!

99
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:38,958
Attack!

100
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:42,041
Attack!

101
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:03,791
After the city was taken, we chased the Su family...

102
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:05,708
...all the way to the Xuanyuan Tomb.

103
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:09,500
We were determined to chop off Su Hu's head...

104
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,125
...to avenge his son, Su Quanxiao.

105
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:14,875
Brother!

106
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:15,708
Brother!

107
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:19,583
Brother!

108
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:23,541
Never forget...

109
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:26,916
the Su family will never submit to the Shang King!

110
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:10,500
Father.

111
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:25,125
Run!

112
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:25,416
Watch out.

113
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:58,583
A woman.

114
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:02,625
Who is she?

115
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:05,000
Su Hu's daughter,

116
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:06,583
Su Daji.

117
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:09,833
The daughter of a traitor...

118
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:12,333
...must be put to death.

119
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:14,583
Ji Fa,

120
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:16,916
kill her.

121
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:17,750
Huh?

122
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:19,833
Kill a woman?

123
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,333
I can't.

124
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:25,208
Jiang Wenhuan,

125
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:26,583
you do it.

126
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:27,458
E Shun,

127
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:28,583
you do it.

128
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:30,416
Why don't you do it?

129
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:40,916
My hairpin...

130
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:48,125
Ji Fa!

131
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:48,791
Ji Fa!

132
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:10,250
It would be a waste...

133
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:12,500
...to kill a girl like that.

134
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:14,875
Let's give her to the Commander.

135
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:16,875
You losers!

136
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:18,541
I'll do it.

137
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:19,166
Yin Jiao!

138
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:20,041
Yin Jiao!

139
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:28,208
Sir!

140
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:30,000
Sir!

141
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:30,916
Sir!

142
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,250
A toast to us! Warriors...

143
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:50,375
...of the Shang Dynasty!

144
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:52,208
Hear, hear.

145
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:54,625
I want to make a toast...

146
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:57,166
...to our brother,

147
00:18:57,708 --> 00:18:58,500
Su Quanxiao.

148
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:00,458
To our brother.

149
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:01,166
To our brother.

150
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:03,833
The son of the traitor Su Hu...

151
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:06,291
...doesn’t deserve to be our brother.

152
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:08,583
Father and son are not always the same.

153
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:10,833
His father may have been a traitor,

154
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:12,583
but Su Quanxiao did nothing wrong.

155
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:14,750
Like father, like son.

156
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:17,541
Your father, Ji Chang, Duke of the West,

157
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:19,875
knows nothing but plowing the fields.

158
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:21,916
Even in that armor, Ji Fa,

159
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:24,000
you're still just a farmer from Xiqi,

160
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:26,958
reeking of manure.

161
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:30,083
Let's drink.

162
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:33,125
Your father, Chong Houhu, Duke of the North,

163
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:36,833
knows nothing but hunting animals.

164
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:39,333
Even in that armor,

165
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:40,791
you're still...

166
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:42,541
...just a hunter,

167
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,083
reeking of... what?

168
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:46,166
What does he smell like?

169
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:47,708
A beast.

170
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:57,416
I know what you want.

171
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:16,000
You want to be...

172
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:23,583
...King of All The World.

173
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:38,666
You know what happens to the daughters of traitors?

174
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,875
At dawn, you'll be offered as a sacrifice to our banner.

175
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:49,833
I'm different from the others.

176
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:52,958
I can help you.

177
00:22:29,708 --> 00:22:31,625
After being a hostage in Zhaoge for eight years,

178
00:22:32,708 --> 00:22:33,583
on this day,

179
00:22:34,083 --> 00:22:36,625
I finally return as a hero...

180
00:22:37,291 --> 00:22:40,291
...to the welcoming cheers of the entire city.

181
00:23:26,833 --> 00:23:30,791
I, Yin Shou, bow to His Majesty and His Highness.

182
00:23:38,833 --> 00:23:41,375
To you, Father, I present Su Hu’s head.

183
00:23:51,875 --> 00:23:55,250
And to you, Brother, the battle flag of Jizhou.

184
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,000
Su Hu,

185
00:24:04,666 --> 00:24:08,250
you once declared you’d never bow to me,

186
00:24:08,708 --> 00:24:10,000
and yet, here you are.

187
00:24:10,083 --> 00:24:11,583
At the victory banquet tomorrow,

188
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:13,375
we’ll use his skull as a goblet...

189
00:24:13,541 --> 00:24:15,000
...and drink from it until daybreak!

190
00:24:16,583 --> 00:24:24,083
King of Shang, King of All Realms!

191
00:24:24,916 --> 00:24:27,708
The Hostage Brigade, returning in victory,

192
00:24:27,708 --> 00:24:31,291
will perform a war dance for His Majesty.

193
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:37,500
Attack!

194
00:24:43,333 --> 00:24:45,958
Long live Your Majesty!

195
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,333
My son...

196
00:25:03,333 --> 00:25:06,833
...my dearest son dances for me!

197
00:25:07,416 --> 00:25:10,208
Excellent!

198
00:25:53,125 --> 00:25:53,958
Encircle him!

199
00:25:56,125 --> 00:25:56,833
Shields!

200
00:26:39,208 --> 00:26:40,000
Your Highness...

201
00:26:46,666 --> 00:26:48,000
He's dead!

202
00:26:48,958 --> 00:26:50,125
Ji Fa,

203
00:26:50,791 --> 00:26:53,208
you killed the Prince.

204
00:26:53,208 --> 00:26:54,708
Your entire family will be executed.

205
00:26:55,666 --> 00:26:56,833
Ji Fa.

206
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:00,833
Killing the Prince is a serious crime,

207
00:27:00,833 --> 00:27:02,916
and the penalty is death.

208
00:27:02,916 --> 00:27:04,250
What a horrific crime!

209
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:12,291
Father!

210
00:27:34,041 --> 00:27:37,625
My brother Yin Qi killed our father, the King.

211
00:27:41,625 --> 00:27:42,208
Ji Fa,

212
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:50,375
what you did was not only justified,

213
00:27:51,375 --> 00:27:54,875
but a service to our kingdom.

214
00:28:32,166 --> 00:28:34,250
If Yin Jiao hadn’t spoken for me...

215
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:36,166
...and the Commander hadn’t shown mercy,

216
00:28:36,166 --> 00:28:39,083
my whole family would have been executed.

217
00:28:39,458 --> 00:28:41,458
But now that the King is dead,

218
00:28:41,458 --> 00:28:44,041
what would become of the Shang dynasty?

219
00:29:06,375 --> 00:29:10,166
So this is why the Supreme One summoned the twelve of us...

220
00:29:10,625 --> 00:29:12,250
...here to the Yuxu Palace.

221
00:29:12,875 --> 00:29:14,375
The mortal world is in misery.

222
00:29:14,375 --> 00:29:16,791
Is this the future of all humanity?

223
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:20,083
This is the Great Curse. Tell us, Supreme One,

224
00:29:20,666 --> 00:29:22,833
what have the mortals done to deserve this?

225
00:29:23,458 --> 00:29:25,166
When wars are raging

226
00:29:25,166 --> 00:29:26,416
and demons become rampant,

227
00:29:27,083 --> 00:29:29,791
The Great Curse is sure to fall upon all.

228
00:29:30,458 --> 00:29:31,208
In the beginning,

229
00:29:31,666 --> 00:29:33,416
when Pangu broke through the chaos,

230
00:29:34,041 --> 00:29:35,875
the pure Qi rose to form the sky...

231
00:29:35,875 --> 00:29:37,541
...and the impure descended to form the earth.

232
00:29:38,125 --> 00:29:39,625
The sky and earth were thus created,

233
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:41,333
and life flourished.

234
00:29:42,416 --> 00:29:44,125
The Great Curse will cause...

235
00:29:44,125 --> 00:29:45,791
...everything to be reversed.

236
00:29:46,458 --> 00:29:48,791
The world is falling back into chaos...

237
00:29:49,166 --> 00:29:50,833
...and all life will be extinguished.

238
00:29:51,416 --> 00:29:54,208
Although the mortals probably deserve it,

239
00:29:54,666 --> 00:29:57,708
we can't just sit here and do nothing.

240
00:29:58,625 --> 00:30:00,583
Lady Nuwa left the Fengshen Bang...

241
00:30:00,583 --> 00:30:02,041
...here in Kunlun, under our guard...

242
00:30:02,458 --> 00:30:04,958
...precisely because she foresaw this day.

243
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,833
It is time for the Fengshen Bang to be delivered unto the world.

244
00:30:10,291 --> 00:30:12,791
As soon as the Fengshen Bang is placed into the hands...

245
00:30:12,791 --> 00:30:14,375
...of the King of All Realms,

246
00:30:14,375 --> 00:30:16,791
and he unseals it and invests the new gods,

247
00:30:16,791 --> 00:30:18,833
the Great Curse will be lifted...

248
00:30:18,833 --> 00:30:20,625
...and humanity will be saved.

249
00:30:20,875 --> 00:30:23,041
I'm sure you're all aware of the price one must pay...

250
00:30:23,041 --> 00:30:25,333
...to be the bearer of the Fengshen Bang.

251
00:30:26,166 --> 00:30:28,125
Supreme One, allow me.

252
00:30:28,625 --> 00:30:30,208
It should be me this time.

253
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:32,083
I’ll do it.

254
00:30:32,416 --> 00:30:33,625
I should be the one.

255
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:36,916
There’s no room for error.

256
00:30:37,375 --> 00:30:39,333
We must let the Supreme One decide...

257
00:30:39,666 --> 00:30:41,375
...who the bearer shall be.

258
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,416
Humanity is in dire peril.

259
00:31:21,416 --> 00:31:24,000
I’ll deliver the Fengshen Bang to them.

260
00:31:24,958 --> 00:31:25,750
Ziya,

261
00:31:26,666 --> 00:31:27,958
you must be aware that,

262
00:31:28,333 --> 00:31:31,375
when an Immortal touches the Fengshen Bang,

263
00:31:31,375 --> 00:31:33,041
they will lose all their powers,

264
00:31:33,041 --> 00:31:34,416
become mortal again,

265
00:31:34,958 --> 00:31:37,750
and, therefore, never return to Kunlun.

266
00:31:40,125 --> 00:31:42,291
All the more reason I should be the one.

267
00:31:43,083 --> 00:31:47,250
And why is that?

268
00:31:47,541 --> 00:31:50,541
All of you have been practising for more than a thousand years...

269
00:31:50,541 --> 00:31:52,333
...to achieve your current powers.

270
00:31:52,875 --> 00:31:54,833
That mustn’t be squandered.

271
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:57,333
I've only been practising for forty years.

272
00:31:57,333 --> 00:31:58,500
It's no great tragedy...

273
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,041
...to lose the powers I have.

274
00:32:00,458 --> 00:32:02,125
And, before I took up practising,

275
00:32:02,125 --> 00:32:03,458
I was a merchant.

276
00:32:03,458 --> 00:32:04,708
I traveled quite often...

277
00:32:04,708 --> 00:32:06,666
...and had a lot of worldly experiences.

278
00:32:08,208 --> 00:32:09,375
I humbly volunteer...

279
00:32:09,791 --> 00:32:11,166
...to take on this task.

280
00:32:11,875 --> 00:32:14,583
Ziya, you haven't been with us for long,

281
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:16,208
and you're not yet able...

282
00:32:16,416 --> 00:32:18,416
...to see visions of the future,

283
00:32:18,416 --> 00:32:20,791
which is why I did not summon you today.

284
00:32:21,125 --> 00:32:24,000
And yet, your intrusion, driven by your sympathy...

285
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,625
...for the mortals,

286
00:32:25,625 --> 00:32:27,666
disrupted our vision of the Great Curse.

287
00:32:29,083 --> 00:32:33,416
Could this be your destiny?

288
00:33:09,375 --> 00:33:10,541
Jiang Ziya,

289
00:33:11,166 --> 00:33:12,791
are you really ready to give up...

290
00:33:12,791 --> 00:33:15,500
...forty years of immortality and power...

291
00:33:16,083 --> 00:33:18,125
...and go back to being a mortal?

292
00:34:06,041 --> 00:34:13,500
The Great Black Bird...

293
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:20,250
...gave birth to the Shang people.

294
00:34:21,833 --> 00:34:23,916
Ancestors, hear me!

295
00:34:23,916 --> 00:34:27,791
I, Yin Shou, never desired to be King,

296
00:34:27,791 --> 00:34:31,125
but the country must have a ruler,

297
00:34:31,125 --> 00:34:34,416
and I, being my father's only living child,

298
00:34:34,416 --> 00:34:36,375
have no choice but to ascend the throne...

299
00:34:36,375 --> 00:34:38,791
...and sustain the Shang dynasty.

300
00:34:39,416 --> 00:34:40,958
I now implore my uncle, High Priest Bi Gan...

301
00:34:40,958 --> 00:34:43,333
...to see into our kingdom’s future.

302
00:35:50,875 --> 00:35:52,166
The dynasty is doomed!

303
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:53,375
The dynasty is doomed!

304
00:35:53,458 --> 00:35:54,333
The dynasty is doomed!

305
00:35:54,458 --> 00:35:55,333
The dynasty is doomed!

306
00:35:58,041 --> 00:35:59,666
The dynasty is doomed!

307
00:36:04,666 --> 00:36:07,000
The dynasty is doomed!

308
00:36:15,791 --> 00:36:17,416
Uncle, what are you saying?

309
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,666
The Gods foretold our doom...

310
00:36:19,666 --> 00:36:22,916
...by shattering our divination.

311
00:36:23,375 --> 00:36:24,625
What have we done to deserve a curse like that?

312
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:26,666
A member of our royal family...

313
00:36:26,666 --> 00:36:29,833
...killed his own father and King.

314
00:36:29,833 --> 00:36:33,583
No greater sin could have been committed,

315
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:37,166
the gods have been enraged.

316
00:36:37,791 --> 00:36:39,458
We descendants of Cheng Tang...

317
00:36:39,458 --> 00:36:42,666
...are no longer fit to be King of All Realms.

318
00:36:43,083 --> 00:36:45,333
I will sacrifice a hundred human lives...

319
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,208
...to quell their rage.

320
00:36:47,208 --> 00:36:48,291
It’s useless.

321
00:36:48,666 --> 00:36:49,791
One thousand, then.

322
00:36:49,791 --> 00:36:53,541
Even ten thousand won't help.

323
00:36:53,875 --> 00:36:55,125
Back in the beginning,

324
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:59,125
when our ancestor Cheng Tang united the land,

325
00:36:59,583 --> 00:37:03,125
so many lives were taken that a Great Curse fell.

326
00:37:03,541 --> 00:37:07,333
A great drought of seven years...

327
00:37:07,333 --> 00:37:10,125
...left the land completely barren.

328
00:37:10,875 --> 00:37:15,458
By building and mounting a sacrificial pyre...

329
00:37:15,458 --> 00:37:16,791
...and immolating himself,

330
00:37:16,791 --> 00:37:21,708
Cheng Tang finally moved the Gods and lifted the curse.

331
00:37:21,708 --> 00:37:25,791
Are you suggesting I should do the same?

332
00:37:26,458 --> 00:37:27,625
How dare you, Bi Gan!

333
00:37:35,333 --> 00:37:36,958
My father only just ascended the throne...

334
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:38,958
...and you want him to sacrifice himself!

335
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:41,291
The very idea...

336
00:37:41,291 --> 00:37:42,041
...is treason!

337
00:37:42,083 --> 00:37:43,333
You fool!

338
00:37:43,333 --> 00:37:45,541
The Great Curse is just beginning.

339
00:37:45,958 --> 00:37:47,333
Before long,

340
00:37:47,333 --> 00:37:49,750
our people will be in misery...

341
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:51,375
...and our ancestors will be without offerings.

342
00:37:51,375 --> 00:37:52,333
When that time comes,

343
00:37:52,333 --> 00:37:55,791
the entire Shang dynasty will be no more!

344
00:37:58,041 --> 00:37:59,916
Father, pass the throne to me.

345
00:38:00,041 --> 00:38:01,875
I will sacrifice myself in your place.

346
00:38:07,666 --> 00:38:09,083
What is a king...

347
00:38:10,291 --> 00:38:13,625
...if not the bearer of all earthly sins?

348
00:38:16,041 --> 00:38:19,000
I will follow our ancestor Cheng Tang’s example...

349
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,458
...and build a sacrificial pyre in Zhaoge.

350
00:38:23,916 --> 00:38:25,375
On the day it is completed,

351
00:38:26,041 --> 00:38:30,750
I will burn myself as sacrifice to save the kingdom.

352
00:38:33,708 --> 00:38:36,916
Blessed is the kingdom!

353
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:39,583
Kneel!

354
00:38:41,125 --> 00:38:43,125
Blessed is the kingdom!

355
00:38:43,291 --> 00:38:45,166
Blessed is the kingdom!

356
00:38:45,291 --> 00:38:47,083
Blessed is the kingdom!

357
00:38:47,166 --> 00:38:50,208
Kowtow!

358
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,125
I waited outside the Deer Terrace for an hour,

359
00:39:07,291 --> 00:39:08,375
but His Majesty...

360
00:39:09,458 --> 00:39:10,833
...refused to see me.

361
00:39:16,291 --> 00:39:17,541
I'll go fetch him.

362
00:39:19,291 --> 00:39:21,291
You spoke out of turn today.

363
00:39:23,541 --> 00:39:25,041
You’ve aroused your father’s mistrust.

364
00:39:25,875 --> 00:39:27,375
I asked him to pass the throne to me...

365
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:29,875
...so I could die in his place.

366
00:39:30,583 --> 00:39:31,708
Surely he must know that.

367
00:39:34,958 --> 00:39:36,958
You don't know your father.

368
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:39,041
Mother,

369
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,166
you worry too much.

370
00:39:43,333 --> 00:39:44,958
I will bring Father here,

371
00:39:45,583 --> 00:39:47,250
so our family can be together.

372
00:41:03,791 --> 00:41:04,166
Ji Fa.

373
00:41:04,333 --> 00:41:05,000
Yin Jiao.

374
00:41:05,625 --> 00:41:06,416
It's a fox demon.

375
00:41:06,416 --> 00:41:07,750
Follow me.

376
00:41:19,416 --> 00:41:21,208
Are you sure it went this way?

377
00:41:25,208 --> 00:41:27,458
There, in the Celestial Chamber.

378
00:41:38,208 --> 00:41:39,500
His Majesty is resting,

379
00:41:39,708 --> 00:41:41,333
and no one is allowed to enter.

380
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:43,750
My father is in danger.

381
00:41:44,083 --> 00:41:45,375
I don't have time for this!

382
00:42:17,541 --> 00:42:18,291
Who's there?

383
00:42:20,125 --> 00:42:20,875
Father,

384
00:42:21,333 --> 00:42:22,375
it's me.

385
00:42:22,666 --> 00:42:24,958
Barging in at this hour, carrying a sword!

386
00:42:26,125 --> 00:42:27,625
Aren't you in a hurry...

387
00:42:27,875 --> 00:42:29,500
...to sit on my throne!

388
00:42:29,625 --> 00:42:30,583
I would never!

389
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:32,208
I was chasing a fox...

390
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:34,625
...demon.

391
00:42:35,166 --> 00:42:36,458
We barged in here out of concern...

392
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:39,000
...for Your Majesty's safety. Please forgive us.

393
00:42:39,125 --> 00:42:40,250
What fox demon?

394
00:42:41,166 --> 00:42:42,500
What's she doing here?

395
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:44,500
Get out!

396
00:42:45,166 --> 00:42:46,125
At once, Your Majesty!

397
00:42:54,875 --> 00:42:57,166
I should have killed her when we first saw her!

398
00:42:58,208 --> 00:43:00,416
His Majesty is sacrificing himself to save the world.

399
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:01,625
He is a hero.

400
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:07,250
Don't upset him again.

401
00:43:11,291 --> 00:43:13,083
If it were your father,

402
00:43:13,458 --> 00:43:14,916
what would you do?

403
00:43:23,083 --> 00:43:24,541
I've been away for eight years.

404
00:43:25,791 --> 00:43:27,250
My own father...

405
00:43:28,333 --> 00:43:30,791
...probably wouldn't even recognize me anymore.

406
00:43:52,875 --> 00:43:55,375
I'm afraid we'll have a bad harvest this year.

407
00:43:58,250 --> 00:44:01,166
With the Great Curse upon Zhaoge,

408
00:44:01,166 --> 00:44:05,583
even Xiqi is affected.

409
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:07,916
Thanks to your precautions, Father,

410
00:44:08,291 --> 00:44:10,166
we have enough food stored...

411
00:44:10,166 --> 00:44:11,875
...for the next three years.

412
00:44:12,625 --> 00:44:14,833
What about after that?

413
00:44:26,333 --> 00:44:27,500
In the course of one night,

414
00:44:27,916 --> 00:44:30,541
the King and the Prince were both killed.

415
00:44:30,583 --> 00:44:31,916
Most strange,

416
00:44:32,833 --> 00:44:35,375
the new King should be so hasty to ascend the throne,

417
00:44:36,125 --> 00:44:39,208
and then immediately summon the Four Dukes,

418
00:44:39,208 --> 00:44:41,083
with dark intentions, I think.

419
00:44:41,458 --> 00:44:42,833
This trip to Zhaoge...

420
00:44:42,833 --> 00:44:44,583
...could be most treacherous.

421
00:44:44,958 --> 00:44:46,166
Please reconsider, Father.

422
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:48,083
My Lord.

423
00:44:49,541 --> 00:44:53,708
If I disobey the King, war will ensue...

424
00:44:53,708 --> 00:44:57,625
...and the entire country will pay the price.

425
00:45:00,333 --> 00:45:03,750
Although the throne has changed hands,

426
00:45:04,333 --> 00:45:07,833
my duties remain the same.

427
00:45:12,375 --> 00:45:15,791
Let's take this chance to visit Ji Fa.

428
00:45:16,708 --> 00:45:18,458
It's been eight years.

429
00:45:18,916 --> 00:45:21,208
He must be as tall as you now.

430
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:25,250
Maybe even taller.

431
00:45:31,958 --> 00:45:35,333
When I'm gone, you're the guardian of Xiqi,

432
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,708
and you must keep it safe.

433
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,791
No matter what happens,

434
00:45:40,875 --> 00:45:44,208
don't leave Xiqi.

435
00:45:46,916 --> 00:45:49,250
Safe return, Father.

436
00:46:16,625 --> 00:46:17,666
Line up. Line up.

437
00:46:17,833 --> 00:46:18,875
Let them through.

438
00:46:19,583 --> 00:46:20,625
Stop pushing.

439
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:22,541
Stop them.

440
00:46:22,916 --> 00:46:23,541
Stop pushing.

441
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:27,000
Stay back, you lot!

442
00:46:27,125 --> 00:46:27,916
Your pass.

443
00:46:27,916 --> 00:46:29,208
No pass, no entry.

444
00:46:29,875 --> 00:46:31,291
We need a pass?

445
00:46:32,041 --> 00:46:33,166
What a nuisance.

446
00:46:33,166 --> 00:46:33,875
Master Ziya,

447
00:46:33,875 --> 00:46:35,708
let me fly you in on my Fire Wheels.

448
00:46:36,041 --> 00:46:39,041
My Five Elements Teleportation is faster.

449
00:46:39,041 --> 00:46:41,708
No. When we set out, the Supreme One told us...

450
00:46:41,708 --> 00:46:43,708
...to refrain from using our powers.

451
00:46:45,750 --> 00:46:48,291
But the mortal world has its own tricks.

452
00:46:49,833 --> 00:46:50,916
Watch this.

453
00:46:54,833 --> 00:46:57,375
Good day, sir.

454
00:46:58,083 --> 00:46:59,125
Who are you?

455
00:47:00,708 --> 00:47:05,333
We are immortals, all the way from Kunlun.

456
00:47:05,333 --> 00:47:08,083
So we have no pass.

457
00:47:08,083 --> 00:47:09,833
No pass?

458
00:47:12,291 --> 00:47:14,208
But, we have this.

459
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:20,708
Take it.

460
00:47:24,125 --> 00:47:25,000
What is this?

461
00:47:26,666 --> 00:47:28,000
Elixir.

462
00:47:29,083 --> 00:47:29,708
What does it do?

463
00:47:30,125 --> 00:47:31,208
What does it do?!

464
00:47:31,333 --> 00:47:35,000
This elixir contains pure Qi,

465
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,541
the essence of water,

466
00:47:36,541 --> 00:47:38,291
the blessing of benevolent gods,

467
00:47:38,291 --> 00:47:43,333
and the best of Sky, Earth and Man.

468
00:47:43,333 --> 00:47:44,500
One whiff.

469
00:47:44,875 --> 00:47:45,958
And you'll feel refreshed.

470
00:47:45,958 --> 00:47:47,125
One taste.

471
00:47:47,125 --> 00:47:49,083
And all discomfort is gone.

472
00:47:50,791 --> 00:47:53,625
Such an amazing elixir can't be bought...

473
00:47:54,208 --> 00:47:56,916
...no matter how much you're ready to offer.

474
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:58,625
Consider it our gift...

475
00:47:58,750 --> 00:47:59,750
...to you, our new friend.

476
00:48:02,583 --> 00:48:05,375
Master Ziya, your mortal trick worked!

477
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:07,041
Come along,

478
00:48:07,041 --> 00:48:08,583
I'll take good care of you.

479
00:48:08,583 --> 00:48:09,333
You're too kind.

480
00:48:09,333 --> 00:48:11,458
I'll drive you into the city myself.

481
00:48:13,375 --> 00:48:15,583
Must His Majesty sacrifice himself...

482
00:48:16,625 --> 00:48:19,625
...on the pyre to dispel the Great Curse?

483
00:48:27,166 --> 00:48:28,458
Maybe...

484
00:48:30,541 --> 00:48:32,791
...only the gods know the answer.

485
00:48:39,375 --> 00:48:40,166
We're here.

486
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:41,125
Get off.

487
00:48:41,375 --> 00:48:42,416
Keep up.

488
00:48:42,708 --> 00:48:43,500
Hurry.

489
00:49:08,375 --> 00:49:08,958
Master Ziya.

490
00:49:55,541 --> 00:49:57,875
Master Ziya, what's going on?

491
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:03,750
Looks like...

492
00:50:04,708 --> 00:50:06,083
...we've been sold.

493
00:50:06,083 --> 00:50:07,000
Sold?

494
00:50:07,083 --> 00:50:10,000
I thought you knew your way around here.

495
00:50:11,875 --> 00:50:13,583
I haven't been back in forty years.

496
00:50:13,583 --> 00:50:15,958
It wasn’t like this before.

497
00:50:16,458 --> 00:50:17,875
Bring them over.

498
00:50:19,666 --> 00:50:20,416
Sir,

499
00:50:20,416 --> 00:50:22,708
we have something for His Majesty.

500
00:50:22,708 --> 00:50:24,083
Cut the crap.

501
00:50:45,958 --> 00:50:46,916
That's about enough.

502
00:50:56,208 --> 00:50:56,791
Oh no.

503
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:14,250
Look!

504
00:51:17,208 --> 00:51:18,458
Thunderbolts!

505
00:51:20,666 --> 00:51:22,000
Go and save those people!

506
00:51:22,166 --> 00:51:23,250
Can we use our powers?

507
00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:23,958
Of course.

508
00:51:24,875 --> 00:51:26,291
Finally!

509
00:52:11,291 --> 00:52:12,833
So the Gods really do exist!

510
00:52:13,583 --> 00:52:14,625
There’s hope for His Majesty!

511
00:52:18,833 --> 00:52:22,750
The alchemist Shen Gongbao from Golden Turtle Island...

512
00:52:22,750 --> 00:52:25,583
...is here to demonstrate his powers for His Majesty.

513
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,791
The honor is mine.

514
00:52:53,541 --> 00:52:54,416
Fascinating.

515
00:52:55,083 --> 00:52:56,125
What sorcery is this?

516
00:52:56,416 --> 00:52:57,458
Your Majesty,

517
00:52:57,708 --> 00:53:00,666
With this spell I can survive beheading.

518
00:53:01,416 --> 00:53:03,083
How about burning?

519
00:53:04,791 --> 00:53:06,916
If one is able to live without his head,

520
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:10,541
a little fire is nothing to worry about.

521
00:53:11,208 --> 00:53:13,916
Perfect. How long does it take to master it?

522
00:53:14,375 --> 00:53:18,416
It took me a thousand years,

523
00:53:18,875 --> 00:53:21,875
but, with Your Majesty's extraordinary talents,

524
00:53:22,250 --> 00:53:25,250
500 years should be enough.

525
00:53:26,458 --> 00:53:27,500
500 years?

526
00:53:27,625 --> 00:53:28,666
That's right.

527
00:53:30,208 --> 00:53:31,041
Ludicrous!

528
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:32,083
That hurts.

529
00:53:35,625 --> 00:53:36,125
No!

530
00:53:36,458 --> 00:53:36,958
Don't.

531
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:40,541
Here. Here.

532
00:53:40,833 --> 00:53:41,875
Over here.

533
00:53:42,333 --> 00:53:43,375
Hurry it up!

534
00:53:44,916 --> 00:53:47,458
Jiang Ziya, Taoist Monk from Kunlun,

535
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
has something to present to His Majesty.

536
00:53:58,916 --> 00:53:59,958
What is it?

537
00:54:00,416 --> 00:54:01,791
What I have here...

538
00:54:02,416 --> 00:54:04,833
...is the Fengshen Bang.

539
00:54:08,041 --> 00:54:09,958
What does it do?

540
00:54:10,333 --> 00:54:12,541
A great turmoil is on the horizon.

541
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:17,583
I was sent by my master, the Supreme One, to bring the
Fengshen Bang...

542
00:54:18,041 --> 00:54:20,916
...to the King of All Realms.

543
00:54:21,791 --> 00:54:25,791
When the King unseals it and invests the new gods,

544
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,125
the Fengshen Bang will dispel the Great Curse...

545
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:32,708
...and all of humanity will be saved.

546
00:54:34,458 --> 00:54:36,416
Can such a small scroll...

547
00:54:36,666 --> 00:54:38,208
...really remove the Great Curse?

548
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:40,458
More than that!

549
00:54:48,250 --> 00:54:52,458
The Fengshen Bang is a sacred artifact left behind by the
Lady Nuwa.

550
00:54:52,958 --> 00:54:57,208
It absorbs the Qi energy of the dead,

551
00:54:57,791 --> 00:55:02,125
or what we may call “souls”.

552
00:55:02,291 --> 00:55:05,500
Once Your Majesty unseals the Fengshen Bang...

553
00:55:05,833 --> 00:55:08,916
all this energy will be yours...

554
00:55:09,333 --> 00:55:12,500
...to command.

555
00:55:13,166 --> 00:55:14,208
That means,

556
00:55:14,750 --> 00:55:16,291
the more people die,

557
00:55:16,625 --> 00:55:18,625
the more powerful the Fengshen Bang becomes?

558
00:55:18,708 --> 00:55:20,875
Your Majesty is insightful.

559
00:55:21,416 --> 00:55:24,583
So the Great Curse may in fact be a blessing.

560
00:55:24,666 --> 00:55:26,416
Your Majesty is all-knowing.

561
00:55:27,708 --> 00:55:29,000
This sorcerer is a demon.

562
00:55:29,375 --> 00:55:30,000
Well, then...

563
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:31,875
...we’ll share in the rewards!

564
00:55:32,041 --> 00:55:32,958
Hang on.

565
00:55:34,083 --> 00:55:36,208
The authenticity...

566
00:55:38,250 --> 00:55:40,541
...of the Fengshen Bang...

567
00:55:43,041 --> 00:55:45,666
...is yet to be proven.

568
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,416
How do we do that?

569
00:55:47,625 --> 00:55:51,333
I could do it...

570
00:55:52,125 --> 00:55:54,583
if I had a freshly-deceased human.

571
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,916
Soul Revelation!

572
00:56:42,791 --> 00:56:46,541
Your Majesty is most decisive,

573
00:56:47,166 --> 00:56:50,208
but there's something else.

574
00:56:50,541 --> 00:56:54,291
A pattern of steps is needed to unseal the Fengshen Bang.

575
00:56:55,041 --> 00:56:56,958
Let me show you.

576
00:56:56,958 --> 00:56:58,375
Watch carefully.

577
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:18,958
Is this...?

578
00:57:26,041 --> 00:57:28,083
Can it be...

579
00:57:28,750 --> 00:57:31,916
...the Steps of the Cosmos?

580
00:57:33,125 --> 00:57:35,166
Not so fast, my Taoist Brother.

581
00:57:35,208 --> 00:57:36,250
Run!

582
00:57:36,375 --> 00:57:37,416
Stop them!

583
00:57:47,291 --> 00:57:48,541
Don't kill anyone!

584
00:57:48,541 --> 00:57:49,458
Got it!

585
00:58:16,583 --> 00:58:17,500
Easy! Easy!

586
00:58:31,291 --> 00:58:32,625
Master Ziya!

587
00:58:47,208 --> 00:58:49,458
Yin Jiao! Ji Fa! Get the Fengshen Bang!

588
00:58:54,416 --> 00:58:54,958
Come on!

589
00:58:55,416 --> 00:58:56,541
Out of my way!

590
00:58:58,833 --> 00:58:59,958
Go after them!

591
00:59:28,041 --> 00:59:28,791
Water Teleportation!

592
00:59:55,958 --> 00:59:57,708
Ji Fa, you go that way!

593
01:00:29,750 --> 01:00:32,083
It's dangerous! Stop!

594
01:00:34,708 --> 01:00:35,583
You stop!

595
01:00:36,333 --> 01:00:37,416
It's a dead end.

596
01:00:37,541 --> 01:00:38,458
If you come closer,

597
01:00:38,875 --> 01:00:40,166
I'll jump.

598
01:00:40,208 --> 01:00:41,666
You’ve come all this way,

599
01:00:42,125 --> 01:00:43,125
why change your mind now?

600
01:00:43,375 --> 01:00:45,000
Just pretend I was never here.

601
01:00:45,375 --> 01:00:47,083
That solves everything, doesn't it?

602
01:00:47,333 --> 01:00:49,000
Go back! Go back!

603
01:00:49,375 --> 01:00:51,625
The Fengshen Bang belongs to the King of All Realms,

604
01:00:51,791 --> 01:00:53,083
and that King is my father.

605
01:00:53,250 --> 01:00:54,750
What right do you have to keep it?

606
01:00:54,750 --> 01:00:56,500
I was going to give it to him,

607
01:00:56,833 --> 01:00:58,500
but I can't now.

608
01:00:58,500 --> 01:00:59,375
You despicable cheat.

609
01:01:03,916 --> 01:01:04,833
Tell me,

610
01:01:05,250 --> 01:01:07,250
what does it mean to be King of All Realms?

611
01:01:07,958 --> 01:01:09,416
If he can slaughter...

612
01:01:09,416 --> 01:01:11,208
...an innocent man,

613
01:01:11,208 --> 01:01:14,375
how can he be trusted with all of humanity?

614
01:01:15,125 --> 01:01:15,916
My father is willing...

615
01:01:15,916 --> 01:01:17,208
The Great Curse is coming,

616
01:01:19,250 --> 01:01:21,291
and countless lives will be lost every day.

617
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:24,833
Yet he called this a blessing!

618
01:01:24,833 --> 01:01:25,625
Tell me.

619
01:01:26,041 --> 01:01:27,375
If you were King,

620
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:28,500
would you do the same?

621
01:01:28,583 --> 01:01:29,333
Shut up!

622
01:01:30,666 --> 01:01:32,625
Return the Fengshen Bang to my father!

623
01:02:06,625 --> 01:02:09,458
Old Man, hand over the Fengshen Bang.

624
01:02:10,250 --> 01:02:12,375
Without it, His Majesty will die.

625
01:02:13,083 --> 01:02:14,458
If I give it to him,

626
01:02:15,416 --> 01:02:18,291
I'm afraid the rest of the world will meet that same fate.

627
01:02:18,833 --> 01:02:19,750
Nonsense!

628
01:02:20,541 --> 01:02:21,791
His Majesty is a hero!

629
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,208
But he takes you as fools.

630
01:02:26,916 --> 01:02:29,333
He doesn't care about anyone else.

631
01:02:29,833 --> 01:02:31,958
He cares only about himself.

632
01:02:32,583 --> 01:02:33,500
Yin Jiao.

633
01:02:37,458 --> 01:02:37,916
Yin Jiao,

634
01:02:38,333 --> 01:02:39,416
he just saved your life.

635
01:02:39,458 --> 01:02:40,291
I don't care.

636
01:02:40,791 --> 01:02:42,166
I need to save my father.

637
01:02:56,666 --> 01:02:57,791
Master Ziya!

638
01:03:02,875 --> 01:03:04,333
Don't hurt him. Don't!

639
01:03:17,083 --> 01:03:18,333
Where is my Fengshen Bang?

640
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:19,833
Release him!

641
01:03:24,125 --> 01:03:24,791
Ji Fa,

642
01:03:24,791 --> 01:03:26,041
take the Fengshen Bang and run!

643
01:03:26,041 --> 01:03:27,458
Don't do it. Don't do it.

644
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,333
You wouldn't dare.

645
01:03:29,333 --> 01:03:30,375
Don't let go!

646
01:03:31,375 --> 01:03:32,833
Don't do it!

647
01:03:36,458 --> 01:03:37,666
He let go.

648
01:03:38,416 --> 01:03:39,958
Thunderbolts!

649
01:03:45,875 --> 01:03:47,250
He actually jumped!

650
01:04:03,666 --> 01:04:04,333
Yin Jiao.

651
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:07,041
Master,

652
01:05:07,875 --> 01:05:09,916
I have something important to report to you.

653
01:05:10,416 --> 01:05:11,541
It’s the Fengshen Bang.

654
01:05:11,958 --> 01:05:14,875
I actually saw the Fengshen Bang.

655
01:05:15,583 --> 01:05:18,666
If you saw the Fengshen Bang,

656
01:05:18,666 --> 01:05:21,333
why didn't you bring it to me?

657
01:05:21,833 --> 01:05:24,000
Forgive me, Master.

658
01:05:25,625 --> 01:05:27,125
It's not that I didn't try,

659
01:05:27,916 --> 01:05:31,500
but the Kunlun monk had lots of backup.

660
01:05:32,333 --> 01:05:33,416
I was...

661
01:05:34,333 --> 01:05:36,208
What Kunlun monk?

662
01:05:37,833 --> 01:05:40,208
How dare he bully you?

663
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:43,625
Master, let's go teach them a lesson!

664
01:05:47,958 --> 01:05:50,375
This spell is for “Soul Instillation”.

665
01:05:51,708 --> 01:05:53,083
Our Master is good to you.

666
01:05:54,083 --> 01:05:55,458
What are you waiting for? Go!

667
01:05:56,083 --> 01:05:57,458
Thank you, Master.

668
01:06:28,250 --> 01:06:29,083
Master Ziya.

669
01:06:29,958 --> 01:06:31,833
You're awake.

670
01:06:32,416 --> 01:06:34,041
Yin Shou is the King of All Realms,

671
01:06:34,166 --> 01:06:36,375
but you won’t give the Fengshen Bang to him.

672
01:06:36,625 --> 01:06:38,583
What's the point of us staying here?

673
01:06:38,958 --> 01:06:41,000
Right! We haven't met anyone nice...

674
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,333
...since we began this journey.

675
01:06:42,333 --> 01:06:44,291
You almost lost your life.

676
01:06:45,875 --> 01:06:47,708
Why don’t we take the Fengshen Bang back to Kunlun...

677
01:06:47,708 --> 01:06:50,000
...and leave these mortals to their own devices?

678
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:55,041
Yin Jiao is the Crown Prince.

679
01:06:55,041 --> 01:06:57,833
He is the next King of All Realms.

680
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,166
He’s not like his father.

681
01:07:03,166 --> 01:07:05,833
Yin Jiao? How long do we have to wait...

682
01:07:05,833 --> 01:07:07,625
...for him to become King?

683
01:07:11,416 --> 01:07:13,250
Who said anything about waiting?

684
01:07:17,750 --> 01:07:20,791
Could it be another demon?

685
01:07:32,708 --> 01:07:33,833
Stop.

686
01:07:51,916 --> 01:07:54,958
Where did this baby come from?

687
01:07:57,291 --> 01:07:59,500
So strange. Must be a demon.

688
01:08:02,166 --> 01:08:04,208
My Lord, be careful.

689
01:08:31,750 --> 01:08:36,791
A pitiful thing, all alone.

690
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,000
Sir,

691
01:08:50,083 --> 01:08:52,291
that thing in your arms might be a demon.

692
01:08:54,166 --> 01:08:56,000
Better to kill it now,

693
01:08:57,250 --> 01:08:59,083
before it becomes a threat.

694
01:09:02,208 --> 01:09:04,500
If you can't do it, we will.

695
01:09:04,875 --> 01:09:06,500
It’s just a child.

696
01:09:08,708 --> 01:09:10,666
Even if he is a demon,

697
01:09:10,916 --> 01:09:14,875
whether he grows up to be good or evil...

698
01:09:14,958 --> 01:09:18,750
... depends on how he is raised.

699
01:09:19,125 --> 01:09:21,250
We can't jump to conclusions.

700
01:09:21,250 --> 01:09:23,625
You are absolutely right.

701
01:09:24,125 --> 01:09:26,666
Nezha, Yang Jian, stay your hands.

702
01:09:28,083 --> 01:09:32,916
I am Jiang Ziya. We come from Kunlun.

703
01:09:34,041 --> 01:09:36,583
I am Ji Chang, from Xiqi.

704
01:09:38,625 --> 01:09:41,041
The Duke of the West. It's an honor.

705
01:09:48,333 --> 01:09:50,208
The child is frail.

706
01:09:50,625 --> 01:09:52,458
To save his life,

707
01:09:52,458 --> 01:09:55,583
I propose we send him to Kunlun...

708
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:59,583
...for my master, the Supreme One, to raise.

709
01:10:01,708 --> 01:10:04,958
I've heard a great deal about the Supreme One.

710
01:10:05,166 --> 01:10:10,250
It would be the child’s honor to be taught by him.

711
01:10:11,625 --> 01:10:14,833
Then you should name the child,

712
01:10:15,083 --> 01:10:16,958
so you’ll know him if you meet again.

713
01:10:18,916 --> 01:10:24,250
His birth was accompanied by thunder.

714
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:28,458
Let's name him Lei Zhenzi.

715
01:10:29,541 --> 01:10:33,500
Yang Jian, Nezha, take Lei Zhenzi to Kunlun.

716
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:34,416
Right away.

717
01:10:45,083 --> 01:10:48,708
Strange things keep happening these days.

718
01:10:49,416 --> 01:10:54,041
Is that why you're going to Zhaoge?

719
01:10:54,166 --> 01:10:55,625
We have a new king now.

720
01:10:55,625 --> 01:10:59,875
It's customary for the Four Dukes...

721
01:10:59,875 --> 01:11:02,291
...to pay our respects in person.

722
01:11:02,291 --> 01:11:04,833
So the other three Dukes are also on their way?

723
01:11:04,875 --> 01:11:05,541
Yes.

724
01:11:11,375 --> 01:11:14,791
You asked Ji Chang to summon us...

725
01:11:14,791 --> 01:11:18,916
...to dethrone Yin Shou and make Yin Jiao the new King.

726
01:11:19,375 --> 01:11:20,250
Exactly.

727
01:11:20,625 --> 01:11:21,875
Yin Shou has promised...

728
01:11:22,291 --> 01:11:24,791
...to sacrifice himself to lift the Great Curse.

729
01:11:24,791 --> 01:11:25,791
Fool!

730
01:11:26,583 --> 01:11:28,500
You really believe he would burn himself?

731
01:11:29,250 --> 01:11:30,875
When the pyre is built,

732
01:11:31,208 --> 01:11:33,458
we'll see if he keeps his word.

733
01:11:33,458 --> 01:11:33,833
How can you...

734
01:11:33,833 --> 01:11:36,041
There is no time to lose.

735
01:11:36,416 --> 01:11:39,833
The Great Curse has spread to all realms.

736
01:11:39,833 --> 01:11:43,500
Plagues in the North,

737
01:11:43,750 --> 01:11:46,416
water turning foul in the East,

738
01:11:47,041 --> 01:11:51,125
babies stillborn in the South,

739
01:11:51,541 --> 01:11:54,875
and crop failure in the West.

740
01:11:55,291 --> 01:11:58,666
The longer we wait, the greater the devastation.

741
01:11:59,625 --> 01:12:01,791
This curse was brought on by the Yin family.

742
01:12:01,875 --> 01:12:03,708
It's their responsibility to end it.

743
01:12:04,291 --> 01:12:06,541
The Shang King is the King of All Realms.

744
01:12:06,541 --> 01:12:07,666
The world is his.

745
01:12:07,666 --> 01:12:09,291
This world...

746
01:12:09,291 --> 01:12:11,791
...is not the King's world,

747
01:12:11,791 --> 01:12:14,333
but everyone's world.

748
01:12:14,333 --> 01:12:15,250
Fascinating...

749
01:12:17,833 --> 01:12:19,750
Fascinating...

750
01:12:21,375 --> 01:12:26,250
The Duke of the West’s divinations have never been wrong.

751
01:12:26,250 --> 01:12:27,500
So, what does it say?

752
01:12:27,791 --> 01:12:31,125
The hexagram indicates “deception”.

753
01:12:31,666 --> 01:12:35,500
The killing of a king was not righteous,

754
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:40,000
and a throne fell into undeserving hands.

755
01:12:40,625 --> 01:12:43,250
So it would seem,

756
01:12:44,625 --> 01:12:51,541
the King was not killed by Yin Qi, but someone else.

757
01:12:52,666 --> 01:12:54,166
Who would that be?

758
01:12:54,166 --> 01:12:57,916
Who else but Yin Shou?

759
01:12:57,916 --> 01:13:00,875
It's not right to jump to such conclusions.

760
01:13:05,291 --> 01:13:07,333
Are you with us or not?

761
01:13:07,333 --> 01:13:08,750
It's treason,

762
01:13:11,166 --> 01:13:13,458
with little chance of success.

763
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,541
How about you, Ji Chang?

764
01:13:20,875 --> 01:13:27,791
Don't forget our sons are kept as hostages in Zhaoge.

765
01:13:31,791 --> 01:13:33,208
So be it.

766
01:13:34,875 --> 01:13:36,291
So be it!

767
01:13:36,291 --> 01:13:38,541
I'll return to the south and rally my troops.

768
01:13:38,625 --> 01:13:41,750
I can do this without you.

769
01:13:43,208 --> 01:13:44,583
Stop! Nobody move!

770
01:13:48,958 --> 01:13:52,083
You dare to plot treason!

771
01:13:52,416 --> 01:13:55,083
He's alone. Kill him.

772
01:13:55,083 --> 01:13:57,125
No!

773
01:13:59,458 --> 01:14:02,458
It's my son, Ji Fa.

774
01:14:05,208 --> 01:14:07,791
I am Ji Fa, a guard of the royal court.

775
01:14:08,458 --> 01:14:11,958
I saw Yin Qi kill his father with my own eyes,

776
01:14:12,750 --> 01:14:15,083
and yet you try to smear His Majesty...

777
01:14:15,250 --> 01:14:16,791
...with these false divinations!

778
01:14:17,333 --> 01:14:18,666
Do you see?

779
01:14:18,875 --> 01:14:20,833
He's been a hostage so long...

780
01:14:21,250 --> 01:14:23,291
...that he takes Yin Shou to be his father.

781
01:14:23,666 --> 01:14:25,916
What good is a son like that?

782
01:14:26,208 --> 01:14:27,583
Kill him.

783
01:14:37,833 --> 01:14:39,875
You’re not getting away!

784
01:14:44,916 --> 01:14:46,250
Ji Fa! We finally found you. -Brethren!

785
01:14:46,333 --> 01:14:48,458
We are the royal guards. Drop your weapons!

786
01:14:48,458 --> 01:14:49,875
Step aside!

787
01:14:57,416 --> 01:14:59,125
They say you can see the future.

788
01:14:59,875 --> 01:15:00,750
Ji Chang,

789
01:15:02,083 --> 01:15:03,708
are you able to see...

790
01:15:04,708 --> 01:15:06,166
...your own death?

791
01:15:07,458 --> 01:15:09,333
Your Majesty,

792
01:15:10,333 --> 01:15:11,791
a fortune teller...

793
01:15:12,291 --> 01:15:14,666
...can see the future...

794
01:15:14,666 --> 01:15:16,666
...of everything...

795
01:15:17,208 --> 01:15:18,208
...except for...

796
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,041
...his own fortunes.

797
01:15:21,166 --> 01:15:22,750
What do you see now?

798
01:15:23,833 --> 01:15:25,833
It shows here that,

799
01:15:27,083 --> 01:15:28,375
Your Majesty,

800
01:15:29,458 --> 01:15:33,958
will die by the hand of your own flesh and blood.

801
01:15:42,750 --> 01:15:44,250
Everyone knows that...

802
01:15:44,833 --> 01:15:46,750
...I intend to sacrifice myself...

803
01:15:46,958 --> 01:15:48,833
...to save the world.

804
01:15:48,875 --> 01:15:49,833
Ji Chang,

805
01:15:50,916 --> 01:15:52,458
you’re nothing but a fake!

806
01:15:53,750 --> 01:15:56,250
Go! Stand before your fathers.

807
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:06,666
When Yin Qi killed our father,

808
01:16:07,416 --> 01:16:09,083
your sons were all there,

809
01:16:09,708 --> 01:16:10,875
they saw everything that happened.

810
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,125
But the four of you...

811
01:16:13,625 --> 01:16:15,833
...would believe baseless rumors...

812
01:16:16,250 --> 01:16:18,833
...over what they saw with their own eyes.

813
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:21,041
You’re not stupid.

814
01:16:21,875 --> 01:16:24,250
You’re simply treasonous.

815
01:16:28,625 --> 01:16:31,625
Take a good look at these traitors.

816
01:16:33,666 --> 01:16:35,500
They used to be your fathers.

817
01:16:36,625 --> 01:16:37,333
Now,

818
01:16:38,125 --> 01:16:40,625
they're sinners that betrayed the Shang.

819
01:16:41,125 --> 01:16:42,583
My sister is your wife,

820
01:16:42,916 --> 01:16:44,833
the Queen.

821
01:16:45,083 --> 01:16:47,291
The Crown Prince, Yin Jiao, is my nephew.

822
01:16:48,083 --> 01:16:49,708
Why would I be a traitor?

823
01:16:51,708 --> 01:16:53,166
With the gods as my witnesses,

824
01:16:53,166 --> 01:16:55,291
I never intended to betray you.

825
01:16:55,833 --> 01:16:57,125
Yin Shou!

826
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:01,083
You killed your father and your brother,

827
01:17:01,166 --> 01:17:02,375
and brought on the Great Curse.

828
01:17:02,458 --> 01:17:03,333
You...

829
01:17:04,166 --> 01:17:06,791
...are the sinner.

830
01:17:10,166 --> 01:17:11,375
Your fathers...

831
01:17:12,125 --> 01:17:14,875
...kept their favorite sons close to them,

832
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,125
well-fed and well-dressed,

833
01:17:19,416 --> 01:17:21,000
waiting to one day inherit...

834
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,666
...their throne.

835
01:17:24,458 --> 01:17:25,791
Whereas you...

836
01:17:26,166 --> 01:17:29,375
...were abandoned here in distant Zhaoge,

837
01:17:29,375 --> 01:17:31,333
to fend for yourselves.

838
01:17:34,458 --> 01:17:35,291
And now,

839
01:17:37,125 --> 01:17:38,458
you’ve all grown up,

840
01:17:39,708 --> 01:17:42,791
trained by my hand to become Shang warriors.

841
01:17:44,916 --> 01:17:46,291
Your power and courage...

842
01:17:46,541 --> 01:17:49,791
...have been forged in mortal combat.

843
01:17:51,583 --> 01:17:53,625
No one can tell you what to do.

844
01:17:55,875 --> 01:17:59,208
You are far stronger than your brothers back home.

845
01:17:59,875 --> 01:18:03,541
You are far more qualified to succeed your fathers.

846
01:18:06,250 --> 01:18:10,000
Now, I give you a chance to take what is rightfully yours.

847
01:18:12,083 --> 01:18:14,333
Whoever kills his father...

848
01:18:18,041 --> 01:18:19,791
...can take his place.

849
01:18:27,083 --> 01:18:28,250
Draw your swords!

850
01:18:50,416 --> 01:18:53,708
Have you forgotten how Su Quanxiao died?

851
01:18:57,291 --> 01:18:58,625
Father!

852
01:19:00,458 --> 01:19:01,791
If you don’t kill your father,

853
01:19:03,125 --> 01:19:05,833
he will one day kill you.

854
01:19:13,750 --> 01:19:14,875
Father!

855
01:19:36,541 --> 01:19:37,375
Good.

856
01:19:37,666 --> 01:19:38,541
Chong Yingbiao,

857
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,083
you are now Duke of the North.

858
01:19:48,083 --> 01:19:49,208
You fool!

859
01:19:51,958 --> 01:19:54,041
Do it!

860
01:19:57,625 --> 01:19:58,458
No!

861
01:19:58,750 --> 01:19:59,500
No!

862
01:19:59,541 --> 01:20:00,250
No!

863
01:20:01,916 --> 01:20:03,458
My son!

864
01:20:06,125 --> 01:20:07,041
My son!

865
01:20:25,875 --> 01:20:27,000
You must...

866
01:20:27,250 --> 01:20:28,833
...stay alive.

867
01:20:30,666 --> 01:20:31,708
Jiang Wenhuan,

868
01:20:32,500 --> 01:20:34,208
you are now Duke of the East.

869
01:20:35,083 --> 01:20:35,916
Father!

870
01:20:56,041 --> 01:20:57,000
Ji Fa,

871
01:20:57,458 --> 01:20:59,166
what are you waiting for?

872
01:21:05,250 --> 01:21:07,416
You wish to plead for your father's life?

873
01:21:09,250 --> 01:21:09,791
No.

874
01:21:10,958 --> 01:21:12,500
Ji Chang is a traitor...

875
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:14,375
...who deserves to be executed.

876
01:21:14,416 --> 01:21:16,666
The Four Dukes plotted treason...

877
01:21:17,250 --> 01:21:19,541
...because they were misled by Ji Chang.

878
01:21:19,541 --> 01:21:20,916
Ji Chang is the culprit,

879
01:21:21,125 --> 01:21:22,166
he started the conspiracy.

880
01:21:22,583 --> 01:21:23,541
If we kill him,

881
01:21:23,916 --> 01:21:26,000
his sins will be covered up...

882
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,833
...and no one will know the truth.

883
01:21:31,583 --> 01:21:34,208
He has to apologize in public...

884
01:21:35,125 --> 01:21:36,833
...to let the people know that...

885
01:21:37,375 --> 01:21:39,708
...the Four Dukes attempted treason,

886
01:21:40,375 --> 01:21:42,625
and it was Your Majesty's decisiveness...

887
01:21:42,875 --> 01:21:44,708
...that saved the Shang.

888
01:21:51,458 --> 01:21:53,875
You let the Fengshen Bang get away.

889
01:21:54,333 --> 01:21:55,416
That was a failure.

890
01:21:56,291 --> 01:21:58,958
You captured four traitors for the Shang.

891
01:21:59,291 --> 01:22:00,208
That’s to your credit.

892
01:22:01,625 --> 01:22:02,541
Guards!

893
01:22:06,291 --> 01:22:08,583
Put Ji Chang in the dungeon.

894
01:22:41,708 --> 01:22:42,625
Father.

895
01:22:46,875 --> 01:22:47,791
Father.

896
01:23:05,291 --> 01:23:07,083
That jade circle...

897
01:23:09,041 --> 01:23:13,458
...was my gift to you...

898
01:23:13,791 --> 01:23:16,166
...when I sent you here to be a hostage.

899
01:23:16,666 --> 01:23:19,458
Do you remember what it means?

900
01:23:20,750 --> 01:23:21,833
His Majesty promised me that,

901
01:23:22,208 --> 01:23:23,250
as soon as you confess your crime,

902
01:23:23,541 --> 01:23:24,708
he will let you go back to Xiqi.

903
01:23:25,583 --> 01:23:27,041
The circle...

904
01:23:28,041 --> 01:23:30,750
...means that one day you will return.

905
01:23:33,041 --> 01:23:34,958
It's planting season soon.

906
01:23:35,583 --> 01:23:36,083
Xiqi...

907
01:23:36,083 --> 01:23:39,208
Your false prophecies fomented treason.

908
01:23:40,250 --> 01:23:41,666
Why won’t you admit that?

909
01:23:46,583 --> 01:23:47,958
I was wrong.

910
01:23:50,625 --> 01:23:51,958
I shouldn't have...

911
01:23:53,291 --> 01:23:59,250
...sent you to live with such an evil person as Yin Shou.

912
01:23:59,833 --> 01:24:01,458
How can you call him evil?

913
01:24:03,416 --> 01:24:04,875
I saw with my own eyes...

914
01:24:04,875 --> 01:24:06,750
...how he fought for our country.

915
01:24:07,166 --> 01:24:08,500
I heard with my own ears...

916
01:24:09,041 --> 01:24:10,708
...how he intends to sacrifice himself...

917
01:24:10,958 --> 01:24:12,791
...to appease the Great Curse.

918
01:24:13,958 --> 01:24:15,125
As for you,

919
01:24:15,750 --> 01:24:17,000
you were in Xiqi.

920
01:24:17,541 --> 01:24:18,916
You didn't witness any of that,

921
01:24:19,833 --> 01:24:22,375
and yet you judge him based on a handful of sticks.

922
01:24:23,833 --> 01:24:25,708
It’s ridiculous.

923
01:24:30,125 --> 01:24:31,500
My son,

924
01:24:32,458 --> 01:24:34,583
what you see...

925
01:24:35,500 --> 01:24:40,333
...might only be what Yin Shou wants you to see,

926
01:24:41,916 --> 01:24:43,583
and what you believe...

927
01:24:44,500 --> 01:24:48,583
...might only be what Yin Shou wants you to believe.

928
01:24:54,458 --> 01:24:55,583
Father.

929
01:25:00,708 --> 01:25:02,166
If...

930
01:25:02,750 --> 01:25:05,625
...you truly believed all that,

931
01:25:06,791 --> 01:25:11,000
you would have killed me yesterday in court.

932
01:25:17,041 --> 01:25:18,500
I'm your son.

933
01:25:19,666 --> 01:25:21,375
How could I kill you?

934
01:25:27,916 --> 01:25:29,291
Remember,

935
01:25:30,458 --> 01:25:33,958
it doesn't matter whose son you are.

936
01:25:35,375 --> 01:25:40,000
What matters is who you are.

937
01:26:01,291 --> 01:26:03,666
Such a beautiful body.

938
01:26:05,708 --> 01:26:06,916
To kill it...

939
01:26:07,916 --> 01:26:09,708
...would be a shame, no?

940
01:26:12,416 --> 01:26:14,250
Everything started with you,

941
01:26:15,333 --> 01:26:17,083
perhaps it should end with you as well.

942
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:23,125
It would appear that...

943
01:26:24,458 --> 01:26:27,291
...I’ve awakened a beast.

944
01:26:34,750 --> 01:26:35,875
Keep me around.

945
01:26:38,166 --> 01:26:39,708
I know a way for us...

946
01:26:41,625 --> 01:26:46,583
...to share immortality.

947
01:26:52,375 --> 01:26:54,833
I ask Your Majesty to execute me.

948
01:26:57,250 --> 01:26:58,791
On what grounds?

949
01:26:59,500 --> 01:27:02,083
Jiang Huanchu, Duke of the East,

950
01:27:02,083 --> 01:27:03,833
was executed by Your Majesty.

951
01:27:04,250 --> 01:27:06,791
As his sister, I deserve the same punishment.

952
01:27:07,958 --> 01:27:09,541
You believe he was wronged?

953
01:27:12,583 --> 01:27:14,541
The Four Dukes were loyal men.

954
01:27:15,416 --> 01:27:17,166
By killing them,

955
01:27:17,500 --> 01:27:19,500
you betrayed the trust of your subjects.

956
01:27:20,208 --> 01:27:22,916
Their sons were loving children.

957
01:27:22,916 --> 01:27:24,791
By forcing them to kill their fathers,

958
01:27:24,791 --> 01:27:26,583
you’ve abandoned all morality.

959
01:27:28,250 --> 01:27:29,791
What you killed...

960
01:27:29,791 --> 01:27:31,916
...was more than four men.

961
01:27:31,916 --> 01:27:33,875
You killed the trust of the world...

962
01:27:33,875 --> 01:27:36,500
...and the Shang reign of the last 500 years.

963
01:27:37,833 --> 01:27:39,208
As the Queen...

964
01:27:39,875 --> 01:27:42,083
...of this country,

965
01:27:42,083 --> 01:27:44,666
it’s my duty to advise the King.

966
01:27:44,666 --> 01:27:46,791
As your wife,

967
01:27:46,791 --> 01:27:50,083
it’s my duty to address your sins.

968
01:27:50,083 --> 01:27:52,083
Perhaps my death can serve to...

969
01:27:52,083 --> 01:27:54,041
...bring you to your senses.

970
01:27:54,291 --> 01:27:56,291
The dead are already gone.

971
01:27:58,791 --> 01:28:01,250
Why waste your own life?

972
01:28:07,500 --> 01:28:09,666
A body such as yours...

973
01:28:10,583 --> 01:28:12,250
...is not easy to come by.

974
01:28:15,625 --> 01:28:17,291
As Queen,

975
01:28:19,291 --> 01:28:21,333
you deserve to have...

976
01:28:21,333 --> 01:28:23,125
...all the joy in the world.

977
01:28:32,500 --> 01:28:34,458
Why don't you join us...

978
01:28:35,625 --> 01:28:38,041
...in our joy?

979
01:29:42,458 --> 01:29:44,916
No wonder His Majesty is so fond of you.

980
01:29:47,833 --> 01:29:49,541
Even I...

981
01:29:50,500 --> 01:29:53,166
...can’t help feeling drawn to you.

982
01:30:00,291 --> 01:30:03,333
Strange that a place as cold and remote as Jizhou...

983
01:30:04,875 --> 01:30:08,875
...was able to produce a stunning beauty like you.

984
01:30:20,041 --> 01:30:21,250
If I were the King,

985
01:30:21,250 --> 01:30:24,333
I, too, would fall under your spell.

986
01:30:27,250 --> 01:30:29,583
Evil temptress,

987
01:30:29,958 --> 01:30:31,625
begone from this world!

988
01:31:33,541 --> 01:31:34,458
Demon!

989
01:32:37,750 --> 01:32:38,666
Your Majesty!

990
01:32:38,750 --> 01:32:41,166
So you do intend to kill me!

991
01:32:41,791 --> 01:32:42,541
Father!

992
01:32:46,125 --> 01:32:46,666
She’s not human!

993
01:32:46,958 --> 01:32:47,916
She’s a fox demon!

994
01:32:48,333 --> 01:32:49,500
Protect His Majesty!

995
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:53,791
Guards!

996
01:33:22,958 --> 01:33:24,250
Ji Fa.

997
01:33:28,458 --> 01:33:30,041
What should I do?

998
01:33:35,500 --> 01:33:37,583
This leads to outside the Meridian Gate.

999
01:33:37,833 --> 01:33:40,333
Go to High Priest Bi Gan and hide there.

1000
01:33:44,125 --> 01:33:44,916
If you let me go,

1001
01:33:46,041 --> 01:33:46,833
what will happen to you?

1002
01:33:48,875 --> 01:33:50,041
Give me the Daemon Duke’s sword.

1003
01:34:02,416 --> 01:34:03,000
Ji Fa.

1004
01:34:07,833 --> 01:34:08,666
Chong Yingbiao,

1005
01:34:09,416 --> 01:34:10,250
it's dark in there.

1006
01:34:10,500 --> 01:34:11,958
I'll find you a torch.

1007
01:34:14,166 --> 01:34:14,958
Bring me...

1008
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:16,791
...a torch!

1009
01:34:26,666 --> 01:34:28,666
The Great Curse is upon us,

1010
01:34:28,666 --> 01:34:30,125
and evildoers are everywhere.

1011
01:34:30,125 --> 01:34:32,833
We are in a time of crisis.

1012
01:34:32,833 --> 01:34:34,250
To make the Great Curse abate,

1013
01:34:34,250 --> 01:34:35,875
the evildoers must be rooted out.

1014
01:34:35,875 --> 01:34:38,666
This shows His Majesty's concern for his people.

1015
01:34:38,666 --> 01:34:40,125
The Four Dukes...

1016
01:34:40,125 --> 01:34:41,541
...of the East, West, South and North...

1017
01:34:41,541 --> 01:34:43,166
...were ungrateful traitors...

1018
01:34:43,166 --> 01:34:44,916
...who plotted treason.

1019
01:34:44,916 --> 01:34:46,791
Now that they've failed,

1020
01:34:46,791 --> 01:34:48,416
they are either dead or in prison.

1021
01:34:48,416 --> 01:34:50,041
The Queen, Jiang,

1022
01:34:50,041 --> 01:34:51,541
didn't know her place as a woman,

1023
01:34:51,541 --> 01:34:52,666
and spoke out of turn.

1024
01:34:52,666 --> 01:34:54,375
Ashamed of what she did,

1025
01:34:54,375 --> 01:34:56,291
she drowned herself. -Kneel before the Duke of The North!

1026
01:34:56,291 --> 01:34:57,875
The Crown Prince, Yin Jiao,

1027
01:34:57,875 --> 01:34:59,583
utterly lacking in morals,

1028
01:34:59,583 --> 01:35:01,166
crept into the palace at night...

1029
01:35:01,166 --> 01:35:03,125
...to kill his father and king.

1030
01:35:03,125 --> 01:35:05,083
After he failed, he fled...

1031
01:35:05,083 --> 01:35:07,708
...and is now a wanted man.

1032
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,333
This sword of Yin Jiao’s is sharp indeed.

1033
01:35:32,458 --> 01:35:34,208
I’ve had my eye on you for days now.

1034
01:35:35,083 --> 01:35:36,708
Where are you hiding Yin Jiao?

1035
01:35:38,375 --> 01:35:39,375
At the stable?

1036
01:35:40,250 --> 01:35:41,000
In the barracks?

1037
01:35:42,916 --> 01:35:44,375
Or in a shithole?

1038
01:35:48,583 --> 01:35:49,750
Beast.

1039
01:35:52,541 --> 01:35:53,166
Come on.

1040
01:35:53,458 --> 01:35:54,083
Bring it on!

1041
01:36:20,916 --> 01:36:21,791
Brother!

1042
01:36:26,583 --> 01:36:28,083
All these years alone here in Zhaoge,

1043
01:36:28,208 --> 01:36:29,625
I’m sure you’ve been bullied a lot.

1044
01:36:30,708 --> 01:36:31,666
No way.

1045
01:36:33,208 --> 01:36:34,625
I do all the bullying!

1046
01:36:34,791 --> 01:36:37,208
You’ve always been competitive,

1047
01:36:37,666 --> 01:36:39,250
always wanted to be a great hero.

1048
01:36:40,166 --> 01:36:42,541
I remember when the Shang came for hostages...

1049
01:36:43,208 --> 01:36:45,458
...and Father made us compete in archery...

1050
01:36:45,458 --> 01:36:46,833
...to see who would go.

1051
01:36:47,375 --> 01:36:48,583
Don’t think for a moment that I don’t know...

1052
01:36:49,083 --> 01:36:51,666
...that you tampered with my arrow.

1053
01:36:51,750 --> 01:36:53,208
If I hadn’t,

1054
01:36:53,208 --> 01:36:54,375
how could I have beaten you?

1055
01:36:56,375 --> 01:36:57,416
I know that...

1056
01:36:57,875 --> 01:37:00,333
...you wanted more than the quiet life in Xiqi.

1057
01:37:00,958 --> 01:37:03,375
You longed to be a warrior in Zhaoge.

1058
01:37:04,125 --> 01:37:06,333
Now that you're a royal guard,

1059
01:37:07,208 --> 01:37:09,208
I'm really happy for you.

1060
01:37:14,875 --> 01:37:15,708
Brother,

1061
01:37:16,041 --> 01:37:17,541
you are next in line to be Duke of Xiqi.

1062
01:37:18,125 --> 01:37:19,541
You should have stayed there.

1063
01:37:27,375 --> 01:37:30,416
The carriages outside are loaded with treasure.

1064
01:37:30,541 --> 01:37:31,458
Tell me...

1065
01:37:32,333 --> 01:37:33,541
...is it enough to save Father?

1066
01:37:43,291 --> 01:37:45,208
No amount of treasure will do.

1067
01:37:51,916 --> 01:37:53,541
I've already talked to Father,

1068
01:37:55,625 --> 01:37:57,375
but he won't admit he was wrong.

1069
01:37:58,583 --> 01:38:00,666
Father is like that.

1070
01:38:02,500 --> 01:38:04,166
He never does anything...

1071
01:38:05,791 --> 01:38:07,541
...he doesn't believe in.

1072
01:38:09,708 --> 01:38:10,291
Brother,

1073
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:13,208
don't worry.

1074
01:38:13,625 --> 01:38:15,000
I'm working on it.

1075
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:19,291
I’m afraid that...

1076
01:38:20,750 --> 01:38:22,625
...Father is old and frail.

1077
01:38:23,791 --> 01:38:25,500
He can’t wait much longer.

1078
01:38:32,458 --> 01:38:33,833
My Snow Dragons!

1079
01:38:37,333 --> 01:38:38,708
It's been ages.

1080
01:38:39,291 --> 01:38:41,083
They still recognize me!

1081
01:38:43,666 --> 01:38:45,416
You've been away for too long.

1082
01:38:45,541 --> 01:38:47,916
You probably don’t know your way back anymore.

1083
01:38:48,833 --> 01:38:51,916
These two Snow Dragons were a gift from Father,

1084
01:38:52,583 --> 01:38:54,333
but I’ve trained them over the years.

1085
01:38:55,500 --> 01:38:56,791
They are fast...

1086
01:38:57,333 --> 01:38:58,583
...and know their way around.

1087
01:40:12,041 --> 01:40:13,750
The treasures you brought...

1088
01:40:13,750 --> 01:40:15,083
...do not please me;

1089
01:40:16,625 --> 01:40:17,583
but your presence...

1090
01:40:18,416 --> 01:40:19,791
...pleases me greatly.

1091
01:40:25,583 --> 01:40:26,500
Tell me,

1092
01:40:27,166 --> 01:40:28,541
what do you want?

1093
01:40:29,041 --> 01:40:30,750
Today, I will grant your every wish.

1094
01:40:51,916 --> 01:40:53,458
My father is too old and weak...

1095
01:40:53,708 --> 01:40:55,750
...to survive prison.

1096
01:40:56,083 --> 01:40:57,583
Would you take pity on him...

1097
01:40:57,708 --> 01:40:59,041
...and release him?

1098
01:40:59,208 --> 01:41:01,000
Punish me...

1099
01:41:01,708 --> 01:41:03,333
...in his place.

1100
01:41:05,541 --> 01:41:07,708
Your father was sentenced to death.

1101
01:41:12,958 --> 01:41:14,791
Then I would die for him.

1102
01:42:09,666 --> 01:42:11,208
Ji Fa, it's me.

1103
01:42:14,125 --> 01:42:15,083
Demon monk!

1104
01:42:15,791 --> 01:42:18,333
Every time you show up, something bad happens.

1105
01:42:19,166 --> 01:42:20,166
Where is Yin Jiao?

1106
01:42:20,500 --> 01:42:21,333
Take me to see him!

1107
01:42:21,333 --> 01:42:23,041
You won’t rest until we’re all killed!

1108
01:42:23,041 --> 01:42:24,458
I'm the only one who can save him.

1109
01:42:24,458 --> 01:42:26,125
He can stay in Zhaoge no longer.

1110
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:30,375
Last time you got away,

1111
01:42:30,458 --> 01:42:31,875
but this time you surrendered yourself.

1112
01:42:32,833 --> 01:42:33,708
Stop talking.

1113
01:42:33,708 --> 01:42:35,250
Come with me.

1114
01:42:36,416 --> 01:42:37,833
Leave Zhaoge.

1115
01:42:38,250 --> 01:42:40,000
Kunlun will protect you.

1116
01:42:40,416 --> 01:42:42,500
You're the future King of All Realms.

1117
01:42:43,083 --> 01:42:44,416
The people’s future...

1118
01:42:44,416 --> 01:42:45,083
...depends on...

1119
01:42:47,291 --> 01:42:49,208
My father is the King of All Realms.

1120
01:42:49,583 --> 01:42:50,875
He’s the one that will open the Fengshen Bang...

1121
01:42:50,916 --> 01:42:52,125
...and save the world!

1122
01:42:53,500 --> 01:42:54,708
I told you, old man.

1123
01:42:55,750 --> 01:42:56,958
He won't listen to you.

1124
01:42:57,250 --> 01:42:58,666
You still believe him?

1125
01:42:58,875 --> 01:43:00,833
My Father is bewitched by a fox demon.

1126
01:43:02,250 --> 01:43:03,791
Good and bad fortunes...

1127
01:43:04,916 --> 01:43:06,541
...don't happen by accident.

1128
01:43:07,791 --> 01:43:09,541
Those with evil intentions...

1129
01:43:10,291 --> 01:43:12,250
...attract demons.

1130
01:43:13,625 --> 01:43:15,041
What if...

1131
01:43:15,875 --> 01:43:21,083
What if your father is not bewitched by a fox demon?

1132
01:43:25,416 --> 01:43:27,208
If we can lure Daji to this place...

1133
01:43:27,208 --> 01:43:28,500
...and kill the fox,

1134
01:43:28,500 --> 01:43:31,541
then we will know the truth.

1135
01:43:38,916 --> 01:43:41,708
It pains me to see how you’ve suffered.

1136
01:43:45,083 --> 01:43:46,833
Are you here to kill me?

1137
01:44:00,916 --> 01:44:02,583
I envy you...

1138
01:44:03,291 --> 01:44:05,000
...for having two good sons.

1139
01:44:06,250 --> 01:44:07,750
I, on the other hand,

1140
01:44:08,166 --> 01:44:09,666
only have one,

1141
01:44:10,333 --> 01:44:11,833
who wants to kill me.

1142
01:44:13,666 --> 01:44:15,166
We're both fathers.

1143
01:44:16,333 --> 01:44:17,833
Why am I so afflicted?

1144
01:44:20,083 --> 01:44:23,500
However you treat your own father,

1145
01:44:24,166 --> 01:44:29,083
your son will follow that example.

1146
01:44:29,750 --> 01:44:31,166
But you have no idea...

1147
01:44:31,708 --> 01:44:33,875
...how my father treated me.

1148
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:49,875
I have great admiration for you.

1149
01:44:50,958 --> 01:44:52,583
What should I do?

1150
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,208
I'd like to hear your advice.

1151
01:44:57,708 --> 01:45:00,333
If you keep your word...

1152
01:45:01,250 --> 01:45:02,666
...and sacrifice yourself,

1153
01:45:03,416 --> 01:45:05,083
your sins...

1154
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,333
...will be absolved,

1155
01:45:09,750 --> 01:45:14,458
and you’ll be an honorable descendant of Cheng Tang.

1156
01:45:16,041 --> 01:45:17,583
The thing is,

1157
01:45:18,458 --> 01:45:21,416
can you do it?

1158
01:45:32,708 --> 01:45:36,166
Bo Yikao is here? In Zhaoge?

1159
01:45:37,500 --> 01:45:38,500
Where is he?

1160
01:45:43,333 --> 01:45:45,666
You love your son so much.

1161
01:45:46,291 --> 01:45:49,958
Don't you recognize how he tastes?

1162
01:45:56,916 --> 01:45:58,875
Even beasts don't eat their cubs.

1163
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:03,541
You are less than an animal.

1164
01:46:15,250 --> 01:46:17,250
You want a bite?

1165
01:46:20,291 --> 01:46:21,916
Have a bite.

1166
01:46:23,416 --> 01:46:25,041
Take it!

1167
01:46:27,833 --> 01:46:29,458
Take it!

1168
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,625
You monster!

1169
01:46:34,125 --> 01:46:38,250
Kill me!

1170
01:46:38,250 --> 01:46:39,875
I promised Bo Yikao...

1171
01:46:40,291 --> 01:46:41,500
...that I wouldn’t kill you...

1172
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:43,375
...and that I’d release you.

1173
01:46:44,791 --> 01:46:46,583
You know what you have to do.

1174
01:46:54,625 --> 01:46:55,958
Remember,

1175
01:46:56,708 --> 01:47:00,333
I still have your other son in my hands.

1176
01:47:49,416 --> 01:47:51,458
I have sinned.

1177
01:47:53,208 --> 01:47:56,708
I made a false divination.

1178
01:47:57,000 --> 01:48:00,250
I plotted treason.

1179
01:48:01,041 --> 01:48:04,208
I instigated a revolt.

1180
01:48:05,458 --> 01:48:08,666
I am a criminal.

1181
01:48:08,666 --> 01:48:11,583
I am unforgivable.

1182
01:48:13,250 --> 01:48:15,583
I have sinned.

1183
01:48:16,500 --> 01:48:20,083
I made a false divination.

1184
01:48:20,083 --> 01:48:23,625
I plotted treason.

1185
01:48:24,291 --> 01:48:25,375
I...

1186
01:48:26,791 --> 01:48:30,125
I instigated a revolt.

1187
01:48:33,333 --> 01:48:36,916
I made a false divination.

1188
01:48:38,875 --> 01:48:41,833
I plotted treason.

1189
01:48:43,541 --> 01:48:45,125
I...

1190
01:48:46,083 --> 01:48:47,666
...instigated a revolt.

1191
01:48:49,458 --> 01:48:51,041
I am a criminal.

1192
01:48:58,041 --> 01:48:59,625
I am a criminal.

1193
01:49:02,041 --> 01:49:03,625
I...

1194
01:49:03,625 --> 01:49:07,208
I made a false divination.

1195
01:49:18,083 --> 01:49:20,083
I, Yin Shou,

1196
01:49:20,083 --> 01:49:23,000
have brought Lady Su to meet our ancestors...

1197
01:49:24,166 --> 01:49:26,625
...and ask for their blessing.

1198
01:49:35,791 --> 01:49:37,833
Come closer.

1199
01:49:38,041 --> 01:49:41,125
Let the ancestors see you.

1200
01:49:57,375 --> 01:50:00,750
If I hadn’t seen it with my own eyes,

1201
01:50:01,291 --> 01:50:05,541
I’d never believe that such beauty could exist.

1202
01:50:06,625 --> 01:50:08,458
Give me your hand.

1203
01:50:17,375 --> 01:50:18,166
Fox Demon,

1204
01:50:18,166 --> 01:50:21,541
I’ve locked your meridian pathway!

1205
01:50:22,125 --> 01:50:23,791
Prepare to die.

1206
01:50:23,791 --> 01:50:26,208
How can you say she’s a fox demon?

1207
01:50:27,541 --> 01:50:28,875
Yin Jiao.

1208
01:50:34,500 --> 01:50:37,625
So this is where you've been hiding.

1209
01:50:43,541 --> 01:50:45,208
I saw with my own eyes...

1210
01:50:46,083 --> 01:50:47,833
...how the fox demon inhabits Daji's body.

1211
01:50:49,166 --> 01:50:50,708
Father, I wounded you by accident,

1212
01:50:50,708 --> 01:50:52,916
when I was trying to kill this demon...

1213
01:50:53,458 --> 01:50:54,875
...and avenge Mother.

1214
01:50:55,625 --> 01:50:57,666
Daji has been with me all this time.

1215
01:50:58,166 --> 01:50:59,875
If she were a fox demon, I would know.

1216
01:50:59,875 --> 01:51:01,291
When I kill her,

1217
01:51:01,291 --> 01:51:04,625
her true form will reveal itself.

1218
01:51:05,125 --> 01:51:06,875
What if she’s not a fox demon?

1219
01:51:07,041 --> 01:51:08,625
You will have taken an innocent life!

1220
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:16,041
As the High Priest,

1221
01:51:16,416 --> 01:51:19,416
I have a magical heart with seven chambers.

1222
01:51:20,250 --> 01:51:22,208
Upon consuming this heart,

1223
01:51:22,416 --> 01:51:23,750
any demon...

1224
01:51:24,166 --> 01:51:27,833
...will revert to its original form.

1225
01:51:28,250 --> 01:51:31,250
You would give up your heart for this?

1226
01:51:31,250 --> 01:51:32,916
What is my heart...

1227
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:34,666
...compared to the royal family...

1228
01:51:35,875 --> 01:51:38,458
...and our dynasty?

1229
01:51:44,125 --> 01:51:48,916
But if Su Daji is indeed a fox demon,

1230
01:51:49,041 --> 01:51:51,458
what will Your Majesty do?

1231
01:51:54,708 --> 01:51:55,541
Name your terms.

1232
01:51:56,833 --> 01:51:58,291
She must be put to death.

1233
01:51:59,625 --> 01:52:01,916
Yin Jiao must be pardoned.

1234
01:52:02,666 --> 01:52:05,291
And the Four Dukes must be declared innocent.

1235
01:52:06,083 --> 01:52:08,041
In the name of our ancestors,

1236
01:52:08,666 --> 01:52:12,083
swear to do all this.

1237
01:52:16,916 --> 01:52:18,875
As the ancestors are my witness,

1238
01:52:20,041 --> 01:52:21,333
I swear it!

1239
01:52:22,500 --> 01:52:25,166
Grand uncle, you mustn’t!

1240
01:52:44,083 --> 01:52:45,000
Swallow it!

1241
01:53:26,041 --> 01:53:28,416
Fox demon, you won’t harm His Majesty!

1242
01:53:31,958 --> 01:53:33,333
The fox demon has shown itself.

1243
01:53:33,416 --> 01:53:36,333
Now, Your Majesty, kill it!

1244
01:53:40,166 --> 01:53:42,000
In the name of our ancestors,

1245
01:53:42,416 --> 01:53:46,083
Yin Shou, what are you waiting for?

1246
01:53:48,708 --> 01:53:49,666
Our ancestors?

1247
01:53:54,916 --> 01:53:56,500
Where are these ancestors?

1248
01:54:00,375 --> 01:54:02,583
If I call out to them, do they answer?

1249
01:54:04,500 --> 01:54:06,583
You all say the white fox is a demon.

1250
01:54:08,958 --> 01:54:11,083
In fact, she’s a charm.

1251
01:54:13,416 --> 01:54:16,708
Only she knows what I truly desire.

1252
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:19,125
You want to be...

1253
01:54:20,208 --> 01:54:25,625
...King of All The World.

1254
01:54:38,041 --> 01:54:39,208
The Shang Dynasty...

1255
01:54:39,916 --> 01:54:41,416
...is finished.

1256
01:54:44,791 --> 01:54:45,458
High Priest!

1257
01:54:45,458 --> 01:54:47,125
The Shang Dynasty...

1258
01:54:47,750 --> 01:54:50,708
...is truly finished.

1259
01:54:57,291 --> 01:54:58,875
Grand Uncle!

1260
01:55:00,416 --> 01:55:01,666
The Shang Dynasty...

1261
01:55:05,583 --> 01:55:07,416
Get the High Priest out of here.

1262
01:55:24,541 --> 01:55:25,833
Treacherous boy,

1263
01:55:27,208 --> 01:55:28,750
what do you find so amusing?

1264
01:55:31,541 --> 01:55:33,958
I thought you were bewitched by the fox demon.

1265
01:55:35,833 --> 01:55:38,375
That's why I kept hoping that...

1266
01:55:38,833 --> 01:55:40,666
...you would turn back into...

1267
01:55:40,666 --> 01:55:43,000
...the father...

1268
01:55:43,291 --> 01:55:44,875
...that I respected and looked up to.

1269
01:55:45,375 --> 01:55:47,000
I was such a fool.

1270
01:55:49,708 --> 01:55:52,750
You did this!

1271
01:55:57,291 --> 01:55:59,166
You gave me my life.

1272
01:56:01,083 --> 01:56:02,916
Now you can take it back!

1273
01:56:05,625 --> 01:56:06,375
Yin Jiao!

1274
01:56:20,375 --> 01:56:21,458
Guards!

1275
01:56:25,291 --> 01:56:26,541
Take him away.

1276
01:56:35,833 --> 01:56:37,500
He’ll be executed at the Meridian Gate tomorrow.

1277
01:56:46,666 --> 01:56:49,000
Don’t think I don’t know what you’ve been up to.

1278
01:56:49,250 --> 01:56:50,208
I would never...

1279
01:57:03,541 --> 01:57:05,000
Of all the hostages,

1280
01:57:06,500 --> 01:57:08,000
you were my favorite,

1281
01:57:09,625 --> 01:57:12,041
because on the day you arrived in Zhaoge,

1282
01:57:12,041 --> 01:57:13,750
you told me that...

1283
01:57:14,166 --> 01:57:16,583
...you wanted to be a hero.

1284
01:57:18,416 --> 01:57:20,541
We are one of a kind,

1285
01:57:21,750 --> 01:57:22,666
therefore,

1286
01:57:24,458 --> 01:57:26,250
I'll give you one last chance.

1287
01:57:27,166 --> 01:57:28,708
Go and kill Ji Chang.

1288
01:57:31,875 --> 01:57:32,666
Do that for me...

1289
01:57:34,458 --> 01:57:37,500
...and you’ll become my son and heir,

1290
01:57:38,250 --> 01:57:40,333
the Crown Prince of Shang.

1291
01:57:41,958 --> 01:57:43,833
Don’t disappoint me again.

1292
01:57:51,750 --> 01:57:54,083
I'm a criminal.

1293
01:57:55,250 --> 01:57:58,583
I'm unforgivable.

1294
01:58:01,166 --> 01:58:03,375
I have sinned.

1295
01:58:22,333 --> 01:58:25,125
I thought I would never again see the light of day,

1296
01:58:26,250 --> 01:58:27,750
but you saved me.

1297
01:58:29,083 --> 01:58:30,666
I practised for a thousand years...

1298
01:58:31,500 --> 01:58:33,250
...so as to take on human form...

1299
01:58:33,583 --> 01:58:35,583
...and partake in the pleasures of life.

1300
01:58:37,916 --> 01:58:41,625
But King Cheng Tang sealed me inside the Xuanyuan Tomb.

1301
01:58:43,208 --> 01:58:44,458
It's been 500 years...

1302
01:58:46,666 --> 01:58:50,583
Only the blood of his descendants could break the seal.

1303
01:58:51,625 --> 01:58:55,416
You brought me back to life.

1304
01:58:59,041 --> 01:59:00,833
In return,

1305
01:59:01,625 --> 01:59:03,875
I used a soul transference spell...

1306
01:59:04,291 --> 01:59:06,541
...to inhabit Yin Qi's body...

1307
01:59:07,583 --> 01:59:09,333
...to help you do what you wanted to do,

1308
01:59:10,333 --> 01:59:13,166
to take what you wanted to have.

1309
01:59:16,875 --> 01:59:18,666
I will make you immortal,

1310
01:59:20,416 --> 01:59:22,083
a King for all eternity.

1311
01:59:39,125 --> 01:59:41,458
A subject serves his king...

1312
01:59:41,458 --> 01:59:43,250
...like the sun and moon in the sky.

1313
01:59:44,291 --> 01:59:47,416
Such is the basis of a nation.

1314
01:59:48,625 --> 01:59:50,500
A son serves his father...

1315
01:59:50,791 --> 01:59:52,625
...like the gods in the heavens above.

1316
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:55,458
Such is the foundation of a family.

1317
01:59:56,458 --> 02:00:00,083
That's why there is no greater sin...

1318
02:00:00,083 --> 02:00:02,750
...than the murder of one's father and king.

1319
02:00:03,083 --> 02:00:04,375
The traitorous son, Yin Jiao,

1320
02:00:04,750 --> 02:00:06,500
disregarding all law and ethics,

1321
02:00:06,541 --> 02:00:08,125
armed with murderous intent...

1322
02:00:08,333 --> 02:00:10,666
So then, Ji Chang,

1323
02:00:10,916 --> 02:00:12,125
which one of us was fated to die...

1324
02:00:12,125 --> 02:00:15,041
...by the hand of his own flesh and blood?

1325
02:00:15,041 --> 02:00:16,750
Yin Shou!

1326
02:00:18,208 --> 02:00:22,125
Dead or alive, I’m coming for you!

1327
02:00:22,291 --> 02:00:23,958
Proceed with the execution!

1328
02:00:35,833 --> 02:00:38,375
Nezha, Yang Jian, where are you?

1329
02:00:50,958 --> 02:00:52,083
Brothers of Xiqi,

1330
02:00:52,625 --> 02:00:54,000
save Yin Jiao!

1331
02:01:04,375 --> 02:01:05,291
Stop them!

1332
02:01:10,833 --> 02:01:13,125
You dared to deceive me?!

1333
02:01:14,833 --> 02:01:16,250
Release Yin Jiao,

1334
02:01:16,250 --> 02:01:17,333
or I’ll have to kill you.

1335
02:01:19,875 --> 02:01:21,250
You don't have what it takes.

1336
02:01:23,541 --> 02:01:24,583
Execute him!

1337
02:01:33,708 --> 02:01:34,458
Comrade,

1338
02:01:34,833 --> 02:01:35,875
let me send you on your way.

1339
02:02:08,708 --> 02:02:10,833
You think you’ll kill me?

1340
02:02:11,500 --> 02:02:12,541
Don’t forget,

1341
02:02:13,208 --> 02:02:15,583
I taught you everything you know.

1342
02:02:15,875 --> 02:02:17,041
Save Ji Fa!

1343
02:02:35,500 --> 02:02:37,625
Nezha, Yang Jian, I'm here!

1344
02:02:39,333 --> 02:02:40,208
Master Ziya!

1345
02:02:41,500 --> 02:02:42,958
Come with us! Let’s go!

1346
02:02:43,083 --> 02:02:45,625
Don't worry about me. Take Yin Jiao with you.

1347
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:48,208
Yin Jiao is in two sections! He’s dead.

1348
02:02:48,208 --> 02:02:49,125
Stop wasting time!

1349
02:02:49,125 --> 02:02:51,458
Take him to Kunlun immediately!

1350
02:03:09,750 --> 02:03:10,625
Water Teleportation!

1351
02:03:18,500 --> 02:03:19,666
Did they have to both go?

1352
02:03:55,958 --> 02:03:57,625
If the gods won't kill you,

1353
02:03:57,750 --> 02:03:58,625
I will.

1354
02:04:27,250 --> 02:04:28,958
His Majesty is dead.

1355
02:04:29,666 --> 02:04:33,291
I, Duke of the North, give the orders now.

1356
02:04:54,333 --> 02:04:56,291
Bring me Ji Fa.

1357
02:05:10,875 --> 02:05:12,291
Why are you still in Zhaoge?

1358
02:05:12,500 --> 02:05:13,666
You must have a death wish!

1359
02:05:24,708 --> 02:05:25,875
Soul Transference!

1360
02:06:03,125 --> 02:06:04,541
Yin Shou is dead.

1361
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:06,416
I killed him.

1362
02:06:08,708 --> 02:06:11,083
He’s the one responsible for the Great Curse.

1363
02:06:11,375 --> 02:06:13,166
Stop them!

1364
02:06:21,375 --> 02:06:24,291
Jiang Wenhuan, if you wish to avenge him,

1365
02:06:25,791 --> 02:06:27,250
do it now.

1366
02:06:54,416 --> 02:06:55,583
Stand down!

1367
02:06:58,125 --> 02:06:58,625
Let them go.

1368
02:07:05,333 --> 02:07:06,583
Go!

1369
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:18,208
Close the gates.

1370
02:07:18,333 --> 02:07:19,541
Prepare for battle!

1371
02:07:45,083 --> 02:07:46,125
Someone is coming through!

1372
02:07:46,125 --> 02:07:47,166
Stop him!

1373
02:07:52,541 --> 02:07:53,583
Stop him now!

1374
02:08:00,541 --> 02:08:01,333
It's a fugitive.

1375
02:08:22,458 --> 02:08:23,958
Into the forest!

1376
02:08:25,500 --> 02:08:27,166
Keep up!

1377
02:08:34,875 --> 02:08:36,166
What is this?

1378
02:09:05,541 --> 02:09:06,458
Release the arrows!

1379
02:09:17,875 --> 02:09:19,833
Ji Fa, go. Save yourself.

1380
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:21,833
It's me they're after.

1381
02:09:23,625 --> 02:09:24,875
I’m going to borrow something of yours.

1382
02:09:25,083 --> 02:09:25,875
What?

1383
02:10:53,333 --> 02:10:56,583
Not so fast, my Taoist Brother.

1384
02:11:05,458 --> 02:11:07,083
You!

1385
02:12:30,500 --> 02:12:34,125
Jiang Ziya! You won’t get away!

1386
02:12:59,375 --> 02:13:00,958
Who are you?

1387
02:13:12,500 --> 02:13:14,250
Lei Zhenzi.

1388
02:13:22,250 --> 02:13:23,583
My child,

1389
02:13:25,125 --> 02:13:27,625
let's go home.

1390
02:14:11,250 --> 02:14:15,041
These two Snow Dragons were gifts from Father.

1391
02:14:15,333 --> 02:14:17,166
I've trained them over the years.

1392
02:14:18,041 --> 02:14:19,958
Whenever you want to return,

1393
02:14:20,125 --> 02:14:22,000
just say to them:

1394
02:14:22,250 --> 02:14:23,541
“Home”.

1395
02:14:24,041 --> 02:14:25,708
And they'll take you back to Xiqi.

1396
02:14:35,375 --> 02:14:36,958
The circle.

1397
02:14:41,208 --> 02:14:42,250
Father,

1398
02:14:43,541 --> 02:14:45,791
I promise I'll return home to Xiqi.

1399
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:54,333
Circle.

1400
02:14:59,791 --> 02:15:01,375
Full circle.

1401
02:15:14,458 --> 02:15:16,291
Home.

1402
02:15:57,125 --> 02:15:58,500
It’s a Snow Dragon!

1403
02:15:58,666 --> 02:16:00,666
Young Master's back!

1404
02:16:17,125 --> 02:16:17,958
Father.

1405
02:16:44,125 --> 02:16:45,458
Come.

1406
02:16:56,291 --> 02:16:57,625
Full circle.

1407
02:17:06,958 --> 02:17:08,000
Father,

1408
02:17:12,041 --> 02:17:13,791
I'm back.

1409
02:24:47,041 --> 02:24:50,000
Shang Commander Wen Zhong,

1410
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:55,666
after ten years of battle near the North Sea,

1411
02:24:55,791 --> 02:24:59,625
has returned in victory!
