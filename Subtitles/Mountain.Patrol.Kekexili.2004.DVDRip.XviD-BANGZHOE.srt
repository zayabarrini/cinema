1
00:02:32,385 --> 00:02:33,613
Are you one of the patrol?

2
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,687
Yes.

3
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:36,185
Good.

4
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:37,984
 One of Ritai's men? Yeah.

5
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:42,050
Fine, then cut him loose.

6
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:56,705
What are you looking at? Don't stop.

7
00:02:58,444 --> 00:02:59,775
Hold the leg up.

8
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:02,414
Turn the head a bit.

9
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:09,082
Give me the knife.

10
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:26,802
Kekexili...

11
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,573
the last virgin wilderness of China.

12
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,440
This plain, nearly 4,700 meters high...

13
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:46,986
is the only remaining habitat of the Tibetan antelope.

14
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:54,723
In 1985, poachers began hunting antelopes for their fine wool...

15
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:57,801
which was prized in foreign markets.

16
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:01,063
Within a few years...

17
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:05,008
the number of antelopes plunged from one million to under 10,000.

18
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:11,915
A volunteer civilian patrol was formed in 1993 to combat the poachers.

19
00:04:12,385 --> 00:04:15,252
It was led by Ritai, a retired Tibetan army officer.

20
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:18,085
The patrol fought fierce battles with the poachers...

21
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:20,751
arousing the attention of the outside world.

22
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:30,268
In the winter of 1996...

23
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:33,771
poachers murdered one of the patrolmen.

24
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:37,074
My newspaper immediately sent me to cover the story.

25
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:49,146
QINGHAI

26
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:17,010
Hey, mister.

27
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:20,751
Take our picture. Good morning.

28
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:30,290
Where's Ritai?

29
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:33,028
Ritai!

30
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:38,794
 He's over there. Thanks.

31
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:40,232
Good morning.

32
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:20,865
I'm Ritai.

33
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:23,336
I'd like to interview you.

34
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:26,277
Who are you?

35
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:29,007
What?

36
00:07:30,149 --> 00:07:31,616
Do you have some ID?

37
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,951
I'm a reporter from Beijing.

38
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:39,447
 I don't have the time. Wait a second!

39
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:46,162
You want this place to be declared as a nature reserve.

40
00:07:46,265 --> 00:07:47,562
Maybe I can help.

41
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:00,339
 Dawa. Dawa.

42
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:01,413
Yes.

43
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:08,281
Take him upstairs.

44
00:08:08,387 --> 00:08:11,288
Your bag. Follow me.

45
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:22,161
Prepare dinner.

46
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:23,235
Okay.

47
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:25,561
 You are? Yangjin.

48
00:09:26,265 --> 00:09:28,825
 Are you Ritai's daughter? Yes.

49
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:43,771
What are you reading?

50
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,950
 Just some documents. Oh.

51
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,664
Get some rest.

52
00:10:32,264 --> 00:10:33,856
Where's Liu Dong?

53
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:36,501
Sit.

54
00:10:49,615 --> 00:10:52,812
Here, have some meat.

55
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,422
You're cutting in the wrong direction.

56
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,334
 You understand Tibetan? My father's a Tibetan.

57
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:15,767
Tibetans always point knives towards themselves.

58
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:21,613
Samba cha cha cha Samba cha cha cha

59
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:24,740
Dragon dragon cha cha cha Dragon dragon cha cha cha

60
00:11:25,384 --> 00:11:27,079
You cheat, you lost it.

61
00:11:27,486 --> 00:11:30,080
Liu Dong, drink up.

62
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:35,526
Let me drink it for him.

63
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:43,958
Liu Dong, let's go.

64
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:45,103
Songji.

65
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:49,436
 What's wrong? Where are you going? None of your business.

66
00:11:52,978 --> 00:11:55,845
Honey, where are you going?

67
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:58,274
Liu Dong.

68
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:05,681
 Liu Dong. Yes.

69
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:07,019
Give me a hand.

70
00:12:10,362 --> 00:12:11,624
Take your guns.

71
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:14,796
 Give me a hand. Okay.

72
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:29,446
We're going to the mountains. Hop in.

73
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:43,525
Come back alive!

74
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:47,794
Take care of yourself.

75
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:19,356
MIDNIGHT OF NOVEMBER 1st, 1996

76
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:58,464
Here comes a truck.

77
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:12,277
We have a checkpoint here.

78
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:14,579
 Are there any poachers here? Maybe.

79
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:17,789
We're close to the antelope breeding grounds.

80
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:19,858
They always pass by here.

81
00:14:22,761 --> 00:14:25,389
 Where are you coming from? Wudaoliang construction site.

82
00:14:25,497 --> 00:14:27,089
 Where are you going? Ge'ermu.

83
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,962
We're the mountain patrol.

84
00:14:29,068 --> 00:14:31,662
We need to check your cargo. Get out.

85
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,675
 Do you have pelts with you? No.

86
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:58,224
 What are those? It's cotton.

87
00:14:58,330 --> 00:14:59,991
Once more, what is this?

88
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:02,763
It's antelope wool. Move over!

89
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,136
Get off.

90
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:21,112
What will you do with him?

91
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:22,886
Let him go.

92
00:15:23,355 --> 00:15:24,788
He's just a carrier.

93
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:27,820
We don't have the power to arrest anybody...

94
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:31,295
just to confiscate the pelts.

95
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:54,579
DAY 2: BUDONG SPRINGS CONSERVATION STATION

96
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:10,632
 A-Wang, he's a reporter from Beijing. Hi.

97
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:13,397
He'll make you a big star!

98
00:16:13,505 --> 00:16:14,938
All right!

99
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:24,342
Have a seat.

100
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:30,218
 Here are the supplies for this month. Great. Put them in the corner.

101
00:16:33,058 --> 00:16:35,618
 A-Wang, hurry up with dinner. Okay.

102
00:16:36,428 --> 00:16:40,262
My radio is broken. What's the latest news?

103
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:46,662
Qiangba's not with us anymore.

104
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:49,165
Chasing after another girl?

105
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:51,899
He was killed.

106
00:16:58,384 --> 00:17:01,478
You be careful.

107
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:19,703
I give this song to the White Temple.

108
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:28,507
I sing this song for the White Temple.

109
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:38,221
I give this song to the White Temple.

110
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:46,186
I sing this song for the White Temple.

111
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:56,866
I give this song to the White Temple.

112
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:04,846
I sing this song for the White Temple.

113
00:18:16,061 --> 00:18:19,030
Bless you. Be careful! See you!

114
00:18:20,365 --> 00:18:21,730
Bless you!

115
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:34,009
He's been stationed there all by himself?

116
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:37,640
Yes, he's been there for three years. He keeps the poachers away.

117
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:40,612
Three years.

118
00:18:41,186 --> 00:18:44,121
We're short of hands. We haven't enough men to do it.

119
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:26,722
DAY 3: ZHUONAI LAKE

120
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:23,281
403, 404, 405...

121
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:33,554
Are they all Tibetan antelopes?

122
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:37,868
Bastards.

123
00:20:38,937 --> 00:20:40,872
You! Come here!

124
00:20:40,872 --> 00:20:43,568
You! Come here!

125
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:58,516
 Where are you from? Suihua.

126
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:01,092
 What are you doing here? Collecting worms.

127
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:02,683
Seen any poachers?

128
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:05,452
Yes.

129
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:06,690
How many?

130
00:21:07,232 --> 00:21:08,426
I don't know.

131
00:21:09,635 --> 00:21:12,126
 What about you? I saw some.

132
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:13,670
How many?

133
00:21:14,906 --> 00:21:18,398
 Don't know. Don't lie to us!

134
00:21:19,478 --> 00:21:21,969
We closed our eyes when they started shooting.

135
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,446
It was too dark, we saw nothing.

136
00:21:28,987 --> 00:21:31,182
Do you have a fishing permit?

137
00:21:32,991 --> 00:21:33,958
No.

138
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:37,760
Fine them.

139
00:22:56,708 --> 00:23:00,804
We bury more than 10,000 antelopes each year.

140
00:23:27,506 --> 00:23:32,341
DAY 5: YAK VALLEY

141
00:26:10,769 --> 00:26:11,997
No gas.

142
00:26:28,787 --> 00:26:29,845
It's them.

143
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:32,586
They were here not long ago.

144
00:26:35,827 --> 00:26:37,158
Let's go.

145
00:27:06,925 --> 00:27:09,223
DAY 7: CUMAR RIVER

146
00:27:09,527 --> 00:27:12,690
That's them. Over there!

147
00:27:24,709 --> 00:27:27,507
Stop. All of you!

148
00:27:27,879 --> 00:27:29,870
Don't move, all of you!

149
00:27:31,449 --> 00:27:33,576
Hold it there!

150
00:27:38,123 --> 00:27:40,819
Get down on the ground!

151
00:27:47,766 --> 00:27:50,030
Take off your pants. Cross the river.

152
00:27:57,642 --> 00:27:59,041
Don't move!

153
00:28:33,912 --> 00:28:35,937
Down on the ground.

154
00:28:36,614 --> 00:28:38,104
All of you.

155
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:40,776
Captain, they don't have pelts or guns.

156
00:28:43,154 --> 00:28:44,815
Down on the ground.

157
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:54,660
Where's he injured?

158
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:56,028
His leg.

159
00:29:04,042 --> 00:29:05,475
There's no hope.

160
00:29:07,345 --> 00:29:08,972
It's the artery.

161
00:29:13,118 --> 00:29:15,245
I don't want to die.

162
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,251
What's your name?

163
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:19,390
Ma Rui.

164
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:22,192
Where are you from?

165
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:26,230
Hualong.

166
00:29:27,165 --> 00:29:28,496
How old are you?

167
00:29:29,868 --> 00:29:30,835
Twenty.

168
00:29:33,705 --> 00:29:35,832
Have you ever killed any antelopes?

169
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,770
Please help me.

170
00:29:48,887 --> 00:29:52,983
(Tibetan prayer)

171
00:30:05,003 --> 00:30:06,766
Take them across the river.

172
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:18,031
Hurry. Kneel down!

173
00:31:40,531 --> 00:31:43,056
Ma Zhanlin, do you have anything to say this time?

174
00:31:43,167 --> 00:31:46,432
Let me have another coat. I'm freezing cold.

175
00:31:46,537 --> 00:31:47,902
Where's your boss?

176
00:31:48,006 --> 00:31:50,736
 We just skin them. Don't lie.

177
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:52,372
That's all I do.

178
00:31:52,477 --> 00:31:54,945
 Tell us the truth. I don't know anything.

179
00:31:56,781 --> 00:31:58,476
 Are you the gunman? No.

180
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:00,174
 You're the gunman? No, I'm not.

181
00:32:00,285 --> 00:32:01,912
 Then what do you do? I'm the driver.

182
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:04,113
 Who's the gunman? I don't know.

183
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:06,155
 Who knows? My son is not the gunman.

184
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:07,986
 Who is the gunman? I really don't know.

185
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:09,116
Who knows?

186
00:32:09,227 --> 00:32:12,321
 He knew. He hired us. Ma Zhanlin, cut the crap!

187
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:14,193
I'm just a driver.

188
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:31,609
 Are you the gunman? No, I'm the driver.

189
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:36,178
 Then tell us who the gunman is. I don't know. They're lying.

190
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:39,120
 I really don't know. They say you're in charge.

191
00:32:39,223 --> 00:32:41,987
They're lying to save themselves.

192
00:32:42,093 --> 00:32:44,323
Why are you still here if you're the driver?

193
00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:48,832
The truck broke down. I couldn't fix it.

194
00:32:49,267 --> 00:32:52,168
They can't see you now. Talk.

195
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:54,500
I really don't know anything.

196
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:58,002
 This is your last chance. I really can't help.

197
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:01,737
 Talk! I don't know anything.

198
00:33:01,846 --> 00:33:04,838
 Talk! I know nothing. I just drive the truck.

199
00:33:06,217 --> 00:33:08,845
 I don't know. I really don't. Talk to us!

200
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:14,751
I don't know anything.

201
00:33:16,794 --> 00:33:17,761
Talk.

202
00:33:18,096 --> 00:33:20,496
 I know nothing. Talk to us.

203
00:33:24,235 --> 00:33:25,827
 Let me go. Talk to us.

204
00:33:26,037 --> 00:33:28,130
Talk now or I'll shoot you!

205
00:33:30,241 --> 00:33:32,675
I don't know anything.

206
00:33:33,811 --> 00:33:35,779
Talk now or I'll shoot you!

207
00:33:37,382 --> 00:33:41,409
All right, I'll tell you. Don't kill me.

208
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:06,176
The pelts are here.

209
00:34:06,411 --> 00:34:07,571
Dig.

210
00:34:30,334 --> 00:34:33,326
They're all here. There are more underneath.

211
00:34:58,529 --> 00:35:00,690
How many do we have?

212
00:35:00,798 --> 00:35:04,063
 547, mostly female. It's the breeding season.

213
00:35:05,636 --> 00:35:06,933
What a shame.

214
00:35:18,983 --> 00:35:20,450
The gunman got away.

215
00:35:20,852 --> 00:35:23,013
What about the men you captured?

216
00:35:23,187 --> 00:35:25,348
They were from small caliber rifles.

217
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:28,149
The real gunmen use machine guns.

218
00:35:31,496 --> 00:35:33,555
I've been chasing them for years.

219
00:36:02,126 --> 00:36:03,650
Can I have one?

220
00:36:03,761 --> 00:36:07,288
I haven't smoked for several days, too.

221
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:09,666
Thanks.

222
00:36:10,034 --> 00:36:12,628
What do you do?

223
00:36:17,475 --> 00:36:18,942
I skin the animals.

224
00:36:19,043 --> 00:36:20,567
How much do they pay you?

225
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:22,509
Five Yuan for each pelt.

226
00:36:24,815 --> 00:36:28,649
I'm the fastest skinner in Ge'ermu.

227
00:36:28,786 --> 00:36:30,310
All my children are here, too.

228
00:36:30,421 --> 00:36:33,857
He's my eldest, here's the middle one, and the youngest.

229
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:35,949
They're all skinners.

230
00:36:36,327 --> 00:36:38,557
In the past, I was a shepherd.

231
00:36:39,597 --> 00:36:44,125
I herded sheep, cattle, and camels.

232
00:36:44,502 --> 00:36:47,494
Now the grasslands have turned into desert.

233
00:36:47,605 --> 00:36:50,369
The sheep and cattle all gone dead or sold off.

234
00:36:50,474 --> 00:36:53,773
It's tough to survive here.

235
00:36:58,082 --> 00:37:01,415
 I need to pee. Me, too.

236
00:37:01,686 --> 00:37:03,881
All right, stop yelling.

237
00:37:10,161 --> 00:37:12,459
Gayu, hand me the bucket.

238
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:28,705
 I want to pee. Wait your turn.

239
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:53,832
The gunmen had to cross this river, if they're heading north.

240
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:00,570
It's crossable!

241
00:38:45,923 --> 00:38:48,414
One, two, three!

242
00:39:34,572 --> 00:39:36,631
Get up and help.

243
00:40:21,852 --> 00:40:23,479
Who wants a drink?

244
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:49,341
DAY 9

245
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,673
Rope.

246
00:41:25,916 --> 00:41:27,611
Everyone gets a half.

247
00:41:37,761 --> 00:41:41,629
I want more. I haven't eaten anything in days.

248
00:41:41,799 --> 00:41:45,758
We are sharing our food with you. That's all you get.

249
00:41:56,881 --> 00:41:58,314
Thank you.

250
00:41:58,716 --> 00:42:04,677
Like flowing water

251
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:13,721
Oh, dear mother

252
00:42:13,831 --> 00:42:16,356
No matter how far I travel

253
00:42:16,467 --> 00:42:22,099
I shall return no matter how far I travel

254
00:42:22,339 --> 00:42:26,708
Clouds of brilliant white please deliver my message

255
00:42:26,844 --> 00:42:29,608
I long for home

256
00:42:31,148 --> 00:42:35,278
I pray for you in my heart

257
00:42:57,841 --> 00:42:59,001
Get inside.

258
00:43:00,644 --> 00:43:02,339
Turn around.

259
00:43:15,993 --> 00:43:17,119
Can't sleep?

260
00:43:17,962 --> 00:43:20,829
The air's thin up here. It's better outside the car.

261
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:24,193
 Your nose is bleeding again. It's all right.

262
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:29,630
 It's beautiful. It is.

263
00:43:30,908 --> 00:43:34,173
I get homesick every time I go out on patrol.

264
00:43:34,878 --> 00:43:37,472
Even the lights on the highway remind me of home.

265
00:43:37,581 --> 00:43:40,243
But when I'm home I start thinking of Kekexili.

266
00:43:41,018 --> 00:43:43,543
Do you know what Kekexili means in Tibetan?

267
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:47,450
It means "Beautiful mountains and girls."

268
00:43:47,825 --> 00:43:49,884
That isn't it. In Kekexili...

269
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:52,391
each step may be the first human footprint...

270
00:43:52,496 --> 00:43:55,624
ever made on that spot since the world began.

271
00:43:57,334 --> 00:43:59,427
Those aren't my words.

272
00:43:59,603 --> 00:44:02,163
Two years ago, a geologist came from Beijing.

273
00:44:02,539 --> 00:44:07,476
I took him to Kekexili and he said that to me.

274
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:12,544
Later the geologist went missing.

275
00:44:13,117 --> 00:44:14,812
No one has seen him since.

276
00:44:16,687 --> 00:44:19,349
There's a lot of quicksand around here.

277
00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:30,930
You idiot!

278
00:44:31,435 --> 00:44:36,134
Where are the poachers?

279
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,164
Where are they?

280
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:42,009
 Ma Zhanlin escaped with his sons. When did you fall asleep?

281
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:43,840
Around 5:00 a.m.

282
00:44:43,947 --> 00:44:46,142
Captain!

283
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:48,978
Let go of me!

284
00:44:50,554 --> 00:44:52,181
Hunt them down!

285
00:45:13,477 --> 00:45:15,843
Stop!

286
00:45:16,847 --> 00:45:20,578
Stop!

287
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:27,088
Stop! Did you hear me?

288
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:40,430
Get down! Down!

289
00:45:49,446 --> 00:45:51,141
Watch him!

290
00:45:52,216 --> 00:45:53,843
Get up!

291
00:45:55,686 --> 00:45:56,880
Where's the key?

292
00:45:56,987 --> 00:45:58,648
I don't have it.

293
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:06,688
I really don't have it.

294
00:46:40,297 --> 00:46:41,423
What's this?

295
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:31,838
What's wrong?

296
00:47:32,449 --> 00:47:34,576
Pulmonary edema.

297
00:47:35,419 --> 00:47:36,943
Water?

298
00:47:37,054 --> 00:47:38,919
There isn't any.

299
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:41,585
I can help.

300
00:47:44,328 --> 00:47:48,025
Let him try, he was a vet in Ge'ermu.

301
00:48:05,082 --> 00:48:07,050
Hold his arm.

302
00:48:55,666 --> 00:49:00,069
Liu Dong, you take Dawa back to see the doctor.

303
00:49:01,038 --> 00:49:02,505
Ping Cuo, you should go back, too.

304
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:05,734
My shoulder wound isn't that bad.

305
00:49:05,842 --> 00:49:07,901
I can help watch the prisoners.

306
00:49:08,011 --> 00:49:09,911
All right.

307
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:20,356
We need money for the doctor.

308
00:49:23,026 --> 00:49:25,460
Give him some money.

309
00:49:33,003 --> 00:49:34,436
It's not enough.

310
00:49:34,538 --> 00:49:37,302
 Do we have more? Only the fine for the country.

311
00:49:37,541 --> 00:49:38,803
Give it to him.

312
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:46,745
It's still not enough.

313
00:49:51,088 --> 00:49:53,522
Sell the pelts.

314
00:49:53,690 --> 00:49:56,420
I'm going after the gunman.

315
00:49:56,526 --> 00:49:58,687
You take the route through Huatugou.

316
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:00,861
Okay.

317
00:50:25,389 --> 00:50:28,881
 Good luck. Good luck.

318
00:50:38,802 --> 00:50:41,293
 Goodbye. Goodbye.

319
00:50:52,082 --> 00:50:55,017
Be safe.

320
00:51:01,091 --> 00:51:02,718
Goodbye.

321
00:51:21,144 --> 00:51:24,045
Captain, we're almost out of food.

322
00:51:24,281 --> 00:51:25,578
How much do we have left?

323
00:51:25,682 --> 00:51:28,845
Two days worth for us. Not counting the prisoners.

324
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:32,650
Fuel's nearly gone, too. We should turn back...

325
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:35,122
No way!

326
00:51:35,892 --> 00:51:37,120
How much fuel is there?

327
00:51:37,994 --> 00:51:41,157
Four days if we give up the truck.

328
00:51:42,999 --> 00:51:47,265
That should allow us to catch them.

329
00:52:15,765 --> 00:52:17,995
Step back.

330
00:52:31,181 --> 00:52:33,411
Remove the handcuffs.

331
00:52:40,790 --> 00:52:42,121
Ma Zhanlin.

332
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:46,995
Every time I catch you, you pay a fine.

333
00:52:47,597 --> 00:52:50,623
This time I'm letting you go without a fine.

334
00:52:50,967 --> 00:52:52,594
Really?

335
00:52:52,936 --> 00:52:54,767
Yes.

336
00:52:54,871 --> 00:52:57,135
I'm too old to make it back from here.

337
00:52:58,008 --> 00:53:02,968
I don't have food for you, and I'm short of fuel.

338
00:53:04,614 --> 00:53:08,573
I'm going after your boss. I can't take care of you.

339
00:53:08,885 --> 00:53:10,375
I can't make it.

340
00:53:10,487 --> 00:53:14,184
Yes, you can.

341
00:53:14,291 --> 00:53:17,260
It's 200 kilometers to the Al Mountain.

342
00:53:17,727 --> 00:53:20,855
And 100 more to the Kunlun Pass.

343
00:53:21,264 --> 00:53:23,562
You can make it.

344
00:53:27,003 --> 00:53:30,063
If you don't make it, then it's your fate.

345
00:53:33,076 --> 00:53:34,668
Good luck.

346
00:53:53,096 --> 00:53:55,724
May God be with you.

347
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:46,177
DAY 10: BUGEDABAN PEAK

348
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:18,948
What's wrong?

349
00:55:19,416 --> 00:55:20,383
The engine's gone.

350
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:21,882
Out of oil.

351
00:55:22,085 --> 00:55:24,246
Why didn't you check the oil before?

352
00:55:24,421 --> 00:55:26,651
We've been going nonstop for two days.

353
00:55:27,457 --> 00:55:28,822
Can you fix it?

354
00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:35,898
Wait here for Liu Dong.

355
00:55:40,136 --> 00:55:41,763
Let's go.

356
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:53,410
Good luck.

357
00:55:57,287 --> 00:56:00,120
Good luck!

358
00:56:17,474 --> 00:56:19,567
Can Liu Dong find them?

359
00:56:20,643 --> 00:56:22,873
If it doesn't snow.

360
00:56:50,039 --> 00:56:54,169
DAY 12

361
00:58:01,911 --> 00:58:06,405
DAY 15

362
00:58:28,137 --> 00:58:32,767
Doctor.

363
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:05,838
Doctor.

364
00:59:08,845 --> 00:59:10,938
Get up.

365
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:14,483
This bench is for patients. Your friend is all right.

366
01:00:02,332 --> 01:00:04,800
What do you want? I'm still working.

367
01:00:05,335 --> 01:00:07,428
Where have you been for so long?

368
01:00:07,637 --> 01:00:09,502
You're a mess.

369
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:14,433
I'm working. Let go of me.

370
01:00:34,564 --> 01:00:36,828
Aren't you cold in those fishnets?

371
01:00:38,201 --> 01:00:39,793
It's my working outfit.

372
01:00:49,078 --> 01:00:51,069
What do you want from me anyway?

373
01:00:51,447 --> 01:00:54,610
You look like a lunatic.

374
01:01:09,766 --> 01:01:11,461
Are you playing deaf now?

375
01:01:12,902 --> 01:01:13,994
I miss you!

376
01:01:15,071 --> 01:01:16,936
You miss me but you didn't come to see me.

377
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:18,564
I went patrolling.

378
01:01:19,442 --> 01:01:21,467
I thought you were dead.

379
01:01:25,014 --> 01:01:27,073
I need some money.

380
01:01:28,418 --> 01:01:30,318
You pull this shit every time I see you!

381
01:01:30,586 --> 01:01:32,986
 Lengxue. Do you think I own a bank?

382
01:01:33,790 --> 01:01:36,088
Did you spend my money on other women?

383
01:02:02,051 --> 01:02:05,020
I don't know how you can live that crazy life.

384
01:02:06,956 --> 01:02:09,151
I just want to be with you.

385
01:02:12,895 --> 01:02:14,863
I'm leaving.

386
01:02:32,448 --> 01:02:35,440
You'll forget me soon.

387
01:02:39,188 --> 01:02:42,123
And find yourself another girl.

388
01:03:11,521 --> 01:03:12,613
Lengxue.

389
01:03:54,263 --> 01:03:57,232
Can Ma Zhanlin make it out alive?

390
01:04:26,362 --> 01:04:28,455
What about your men?

391
01:04:28,564 --> 01:04:32,933
I hope it doesn't snow.

392
01:05:29,692 --> 01:05:30,886
What's wrong?

393
01:05:30,993 --> 01:05:33,962
They'll never find us.

394
01:05:34,263 --> 01:05:36,823
We're going to die here.

395
01:05:37,366 --> 01:05:39,231
Shut up!

396
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:19,974
Your whole situation looks pretty desperate.

397
01:06:20,142 --> 01:06:24,875
We're short of money, short of men, short of guns.

398
01:06:27,283 --> 01:06:31,049
My guys haven't been paid for almost a year.

399
01:06:33,389 --> 01:06:35,755
Can the country help?

400
01:06:38,127 --> 01:06:40,459
We're not officially employed.

401
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:46,766
How do you pay for the patrol?

402
01:06:48,237 --> 01:06:50,467
We have to raise the money ourselves.

403
01:06:51,607 --> 01:06:56,408
What do you do with the pelts?

404
01:06:58,014 --> 01:07:00,642
We hand most of them over to the authorities.

405
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:05,753
Do you sell some to raise the money?

406
01:07:55,671 --> 01:07:58,765
Selling the pelts is illegal.

407
01:08:02,311 --> 01:08:05,280
How should I write the article?

408
01:08:06,415 --> 01:08:08,246
I always thought I was a good journalist...

409
01:08:08,350 --> 01:08:10,477
I know you're a reporter.

410
01:08:12,054 --> 01:08:16,252
You think Kekexili can be protected by reporters?

411
01:08:21,430 --> 01:08:23,523
I'll go to prison if I have to.

412
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,059
I know selling pelts is illegal.

413
01:08:27,403 --> 01:08:30,270
But I can't worry about that now.

414
01:08:31,107 --> 01:08:33,268
I can only think about Kekexili...

415
01:08:33,442 --> 01:08:35,171
and my brothers.

416
01:08:37,913 --> 01:08:40,279
Ever seen protestors on a pilgrimage?

417
01:08:41,450 --> 01:08:43,611
Their faces and hands are filthy.

418
01:08:44,253 --> 01:08:46,949
But their hearts are pure.

419
01:08:54,196 --> 01:08:56,357
I've sold pelts before.

420
01:08:57,466 --> 01:08:59,627
I had no choice.

421
01:10:31,694 --> 01:10:34,527
The highway's on the other side of the mountains.

422
01:10:34,630 --> 01:10:38,088
We have to catch them before they get there.

423
01:10:39,802 --> 01:10:42,168
Look around for something to eat.

424
01:10:52,648 --> 01:10:54,479
How many bullets do we have?

425
01:10:55,451 --> 01:10:56,816
A few dozen.

426
01:11:09,331 --> 01:11:11,731
Yixi, what did you do before this?

427
01:11:11,967 --> 01:11:13,059
I was a student.

428
01:11:13,168 --> 01:11:15,568
 Where? Qinghai Normal University.

429
01:11:16,205 --> 01:11:17,866
You should be a teacher.

430
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:19,837
This job is more interesting.

431
01:11:19,942 --> 01:11:21,273
Gayu, are you married?

432
01:11:21,377 --> 01:11:23,174
 No. Girlfriend?

433
01:11:23,712 --> 01:11:25,942
We broke up right before I came here.

434
01:11:27,750 --> 01:11:29,581
Just like my patrol...

435
01:11:29,685 --> 01:11:32,950
each time they go out, their girlfriends leave them.

436
01:11:33,956 --> 01:11:36,652
There are plenty of nice girls out there.

437
01:11:36,759 --> 01:11:37,817
Isn't that right, Yixi?

438
01:11:37,926 --> 01:11:38,984
Right.

439
01:11:42,665 --> 01:11:44,656
What did Bading do before?

440
01:11:45,467 --> 01:11:47,332
A professional rabbit hunter.

441
01:11:47,770 --> 01:11:49,203
Nonsense.

442
01:11:50,739 --> 01:11:53,936
 He worked at a highway checkpoint. For logging trucks.

443
01:11:55,778 --> 01:11:58,338
They worked in all kinds of jobs before joining the team.

444
01:11:58,447 --> 01:12:01,211
Liu Dong was a taxi driver.

445
01:12:01,317 --> 01:12:03,012
A-Wang was a soldier.

446
01:12:03,118 --> 01:12:04,278
Songji was a herder.

447
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:06,144
For you.

448
01:12:18,133 --> 01:12:19,259
Have some!

449
01:12:19,368 --> 01:12:21,893
There's nothing to eat up in those mountains.

450
01:16:47,135 --> 01:16:52,038
DAY 17

451
01:18:21,463 --> 01:18:24,227
Can Yixi and Bading find their way out?

452
01:18:26,668 --> 01:18:27,726
I think so.

453
01:18:27,936 --> 01:18:30,097
Should we wait for them here?

454
01:19:08,710 --> 01:19:11,543
Ma Zhanlin, you're still alive.

455
01:19:12,147 --> 01:19:16,481
I am. But many died on the way out.

456
01:19:19,721 --> 01:19:22,121
My team got separated, too.

457
01:19:25,527 --> 01:19:27,358
This is Capt. Ritai.

458
01:19:27,662 --> 01:19:29,254
This is our boss.

459
01:19:34,436 --> 01:19:36,267
Captain, have a smoke.

460
01:19:38,406 --> 01:19:40,431
I've been chasing you for years.

461
01:19:41,009 --> 01:19:42,738
Why?

462
01:19:44,079 --> 01:19:45,671
You killed my antelope.

463
01:19:46,081 --> 01:19:48,606
 So did a lot of people. That's no excuse.

464
01:19:49,518 --> 01:19:50,985
So what do you want?

465
01:19:51,953 --> 01:19:53,420
You to come with me.

466
01:19:54,156 --> 01:19:56,954
Captain, if you let me off the hook...

467
01:19:57,225 --> 01:19:59,056
I'll buy you two cars...

468
01:20:01,496 --> 01:20:03,726
and I'll build you a new house, too.

469
01:20:03,832 --> 01:20:06,699
 Our boss is kind, and he's rich... Shut up!

470
01:20:09,805 --> 01:20:12,000
Surrender your guns and come with me.

471
01:20:16,878 --> 01:20:20,814
Sure! Let's give the Captain our guns.

472
01:20:20,916 --> 01:20:23,544
We'll join his mountain patrol.

473
01:20:40,769 --> 01:20:42,327
Who fired?

474
01:20:43,638 --> 01:20:45,629
Who fired the gun?

475
01:20:47,843 --> 01:20:50,209
 Who? I did.

476
01:20:58,119 --> 01:21:00,212
Fuck you. You almost hit me.

477
01:21:02,557 --> 01:21:04,218
He's still alive.

478
01:21:38,293 --> 01:21:39,351
Are you a patrolman?

479
01:21:39,461 --> 01:21:43,295
No, he's not Ritai's guy.

480
01:21:43,698 --> 01:21:45,563
You're a dead man if you are!

481
01:21:45,667 --> 01:21:46,861
He's not.

482
01:22:33,548 --> 01:22:37,484
Follow our footprints for five kilometers to get to the highway.
