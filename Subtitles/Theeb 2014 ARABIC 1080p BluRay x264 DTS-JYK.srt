1
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:17,291
<i>He who swims in the Red Sea
cannot know its true depth.</i>

2
00:01:19,288 --> 00:01:24,886
<i>And not just any man, Theeb,
can reach the seabed, my son.</i>

3
00:01:26,712 --> 00:01:32,469
<i>In questions of brotherhood,
never refuse a guest.</i>

4
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:39,601
<i>Be the right hand of the right
when men make their stand.</i>

5
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:46,490
<i>And if the wolves offer friendship,
do not count on success.</i>

6
00:01:47,858 --> 00:01:52,864
<i>They will not stand beside you
when you are facing death.</i>

7
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:07,153
Theeb.

8
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:09,197
Hey, Theeb!

9
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:12,279
Come here.

10
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,702
Come water the camels.

11
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:24,208
Let me get the other camel.

12
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:29,126
- No playing, come here...
- Let me get it.

13
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:58,239
Fill it up.

14
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,043
That's right.

15
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,738
Listen carefully.

16
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,248
See this?

17
00:04:41,323 --> 00:04:44,953
Put the target here, understand?

18
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:46,207
Uh-huh.

19
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,630
Then line it up with that sight.

20
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:53,878
Good, now watch how I do it.

21
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:00,933
Good.

22
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:07,353
Come here.

23
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:11,103
Put it to your shoulder.

24
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:18,159
Hold the rifle properly.
Move forward.

25
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:20,454
- Good.
- Let go.

26
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:28,624
- What?
- Where's the bullet?

27
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,547
Where is it?

28
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:34,927
No bullets until you aim straight.

29
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:36,837
Fair?

30
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,555
No!

31
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,430
Take it.

32
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,771
Careful, it's sharp.

33
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:57,778
- Wait, wait!
- Get up, don't fall in.

34
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:03,492
Let go.
Let go or else!

35
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:04,869
- Or what?
- Let go.

36
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:11,793
- Shall I drop you?
- Hussein, don't!

37
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:15,634
- No more joking, agreed?
- Agreed.

38
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:19,471
- Let's eat. I'm hungry.
- Let's go home.

39
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:21,765
- Six!
- Tabb.

40
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,093
- He got him.
- No, he's short.

41
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:26,724
- He's not short.
- It is Tabb.

42
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,805
- Don't touch it!
- It's Tabb.

43
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:33,227
- It's Tabb, no argument.
- It's Abu Eid's turn.

44
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,733
- Ottoman gold!
- It's a two.

45
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,942
- Your turn, Sheikh.
- How much?

46
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:42,494
- Another six.
- Six!

47
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:44,992
- Two.
- Your dog's dead.

48
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:47,824
- No chance.
- Count them.

49
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,911
You're cheating.

50
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:54,915
- We lost.
- Not yet.

51
00:06:58,627 --> 00:07:00,550
- How much?
- Six, Sheikh.

52
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:02,802
Absolutely, six.

53
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:05,350
- Six!
- Got him.

54
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,052
He's out.

55
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:10,722
Quiet!

56
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:12,857
Someone's out there.

57
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:03,984
Who is it, Hussein?

58
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,964
We have guests.

59
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,387
They are welcome.

60
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,351
Peace be upon you.

61
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:32,183
And unto you, welcome.

62
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:34,515
- How are you?
- Welcome.

63
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:37,692
- Peace be upon you.
- Welcome.

64
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:39,986
- How are you?
- Good and you?

65
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,873
- Welcome.
- Come in.

66
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:57,037
Sit, sit.

67
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,634
In the name of God.

68
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:07,805
- How are you?
- We are well and you?

69
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:12,511
- Good evening.
- And to you.

70
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:18,021
- Coffee, Hussein.
- Coming.

71
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:23,234
Good evening to you all.

72
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:42,540
- A long life.
- And to you.

73
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:45,881
- Long journey?
- Yes, it's been a long ride.

74
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,928
God give you strength.

75
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:52,551
- How is our guest?
- Well and you?

76
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:55,888
How are you?
How's your health?

77
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,311
Come on, Theeb.

78
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,193
- Who's the foreigner?
- I don't know.

79
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:09,860
- What's he want?
- Quiet, child.

80
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,038
Choose one.

81
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,544
Bring that one.

82
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,226
That's right.

83
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:45,110
It's a good one.

84
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,405
In the name of God.

85
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,823
- You want to kill it?
- Yes.

86
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:02,170
- Alright, but don't tell our brother.
- Don't worry.

87
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:06,424
Take it.
Say a prayer.

88
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:13,802
Don't be scared.
Cut here.

89
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,431
- Should I do it?
- No.

90
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:24,601
No, let me.

91
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,438
Help me hold it.

92
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,484
In the name of God.

93
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:08,774
- Eat, eat.
- It was delicious.

94
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:12,156
You didn't eat.

95
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:13,609
Water's there.

96
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:15,660
Theeb, get him water.

97
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:47,518
- Where's your friend from?
- He's English.

98
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:49,978
Stop m

99
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:56,359
I'll send you to Mother.

100
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:03,458
- Where's Sheikh Abu Hmoud's tribe?
- You've arrived.

101
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:07,003
- How is the Sheikh?
- He passed away.

102
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:09,084
May he rest in peace.

103
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:14,469
- He was a good man.
- Thank you.

104
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:18,928
- Does he have sons?
- Yes.

105
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:23,265
I'm the eldest
and this is Hussein and Theeb.

106
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:26,481
- It's an honor.
- The honor's ours.

107
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,155
What's he saying?

108
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:39,906
I don't know.

109
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:42,410
Keep quiet.

110
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:47,751
Get an ember from the fire.

111
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:50,584
He has his own.

112
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:53,834
Thanks.

113
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:04,412
Are you a prince?

114
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:11,039
How many men have you killed?

115
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:03,471
- I have a request, Sheikh.
- Of course.

116
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:07,475
The sharif said you could guide us
to the Roman Well.

117
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:11,972
On the Pilgrim's Trail?

118
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:16,393
That trail's been abandoned
since the railroad came.

119
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:18,937
I have people there.

120
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:23,742
With all respect, there are more raiders
than pilgrims on that trail.

121
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,779
Your father's reputation led us here.

122
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:32,576
You've arrived.

123
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:35,961
My brother Hussein will guide you.

124
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:45,551
- I'll see you, brother.
- Soon, God willing.

125
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:52,429
- With your permission, Sheikh.
- Go in peace.

126
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,100
Hussein!

127
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:05,478
Hussein.

128
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,404
Hussein!

129
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:16,201
Theeb?

130
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:22,537
We need the boy's brother
to guide us.

131
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:27,750
What about the boy?

132
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,760
We can't leave him.

133
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,933
- What's he saying?
- Hold on.

134
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:38,595
Who takes the boy back?

135
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:44,479
We need his brother to guide us.

136
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:46,777
- What's he saying?
- You must come with us.

137
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:50,027
<i>I'll</i> take him home
and come back.

138
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:52,734
He wants to leave now.

139
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:55,448
- Convince him.
- He won't listen.

140
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:50,396
Let's go.

141
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,145
Let's go.

142
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:34,437
Who is she?

143
00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:37,281
His wife.

144
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:39,575
Hussein wants to marry.

145
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:41,698
- Don't be rude.
- Congratulations.

146
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:45,698
It's a long wait.

147
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:47,909
Why do you always wink at her?

148
00:22:48,826 --> 00:22:51,124
Quiet, you're rude.

149
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:54,790
Women.

150
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:59,800
- What's that?
- When you're older.

151
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:04,641
Let your friend sing.

152
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:10,810
- Sing.
- Sing, man.

153
00:23:13,267 --> 00:23:14,484
Sing for us.

154
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,153
- Sing!
_ Sing, Sing_

155
00:23:29,033 --> 00:23:34,335
<i>For too long now</i>

156
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:40,295
<i>You have forsaken home</i>

157
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:21,589
- What do you think?
- Six riders.

158
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:26,465
Pilgrims maybe.

159
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:28,175
Then let's ride.

160
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:31,387
There's a problem, Marji?

161
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,063
No problem.

162
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:51,073
What do they want
with the well?

163
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:55,661
I don't know.
We take them and go home.

164
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:10,472
- What's in the box?
- The box?

165
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:13,187
He goes crazy if I touch it.

166
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,682
The Englishman keeps his gold in it.

167
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:21,236
I'll give them some bread.

168
00:25:42,124 --> 00:25:43,797
Don't touch him.

169
00:25:45,127 --> 00:25:47,721
- Don't you dare touch him!
- Calm down.

170
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:51,637
- Go over there.
- Never touch him!

171
00:26:03,854 --> 00:26:06,983
Never touch my brother!
No matter what he does.

172
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:11,196
He doesn't want anyone
to touch the box.

173
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:15,249
- He didn't know.
- So tell him not to.

174
00:26:15,324 --> 00:26:17,326
Don't touch it again.

175
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,503
Agreed?

176
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:13,804
There's your well.

177
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:20,897
They're coming.

178
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:17,446
Marji, blood!

179
00:28:25,913 --> 00:28:27,665
- They slaughtered them.
- Let's go.

180
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:42,429
We're being watched.

181
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:45,478
Could they be your men?

182
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:09,540
Let's get out of here.

183
00:29:18,215 --> 00:29:19,387
That way, that way.

184
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:26,022
They killed our men.

185
00:29:28,392 --> 00:29:30,611
Those are our men down the well.

186
00:29:31,687 --> 00:29:33,030
What's happening?

187
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:35,524
We need more men.

188
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:40,870
He's crazy.

189
00:30:03,677 --> 00:30:05,054
I can't.

190
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:07,813
I won't leave them.

191
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:11,060
What's wrong with you?

192
00:30:12,019 --> 00:30:13,612
We brought them here.

193
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:16,610
We cannot leave them.

194
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:19,613
I'm not leaving them!

195
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:23,368
I'll die before I abandon them!

196
00:30:23,447 --> 00:30:26,121
- What are they fighting about?
- It's none of our business.

197
00:30:30,037 --> 00:30:31,835
Brotherhood is more important
than your railway.

198
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:53,276
You're leaving?

199
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:56,147
You've done enough.

200
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:58,782
You honor your father's memory.

201
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:16,625
<i>- Peace be upon you.
- Goodbye, Mary.</i>

202
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:18,881
- I hope we meet again.
- God willing.

203
00:31:19,461 --> 00:31:20,838
Goodbye.

204
00:31:20,921 --> 00:31:22,468
Peace be upon you.

205
00:31:30,472 --> 00:31:33,316
Marji, I'm worried
you won't find the next well.

206
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:37,195
The trail's too dangerous
for the boy.

207
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:39,064
Goodbye.

208
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,842
Let's follow them.

209
00:32:08,135 --> 00:32:10,058
- Why?
- Help me pack.

210
00:32:10,137 --> 00:32:11,514
Why?

211
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:14,941
You want them to die of thirst?
We can't leave them.

212
00:32:15,434 --> 00:32:16,526
I'm not going.

213
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:19,646
Why did you follow me then?

214
00:32:21,398 --> 00:32:23,150
Can you survive alone?

215
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:25,361
I can take care of myself.

216
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:29,706
So now you can take care
of yourself?

217
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:32,534
- Why did you follow me then?
- You're not my father.

218
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:42,010
Come pack our things.

219
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:45,839
This trail is for men.

220
00:34:06,253 --> 00:34:08,381
All clear!

221
00:34:26,273 --> 00:34:28,992
Tracks from yesterday.
They lead out of the canyon.

222
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:32,047
You sense something?

223
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:35,721
No.

224
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:01,835
Get back, boy!
Don't fall.

225
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:41,662
It's good.

226
00:36:58,842 --> 00:36:59,843
You see them?

227
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:05,185
- Save your brother.
- We won't leave you.

228
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:08,651
- Go! <i>I'll</i> cover you.
- Run!

229
00:37:28,747 --> 00:37:30,374
- Why did you come back?
- It's a trap.

230
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:38,598
Let's face them.

231
00:37:49,851 --> 00:37:50,693
Got him!

232
00:37:52,312 --> 00:37:53,689
Run.

233
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:16,385
Get up the mountain.

234
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:06,265
- Where are they?
- I lost them.

235
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:17,363
You're surrounded.
Surrender and you'll have peace.

236
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:20,817
We don't want you.
We just want the camels.

237
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:32,245
We lose the camels, we die.

238
00:39:41,546 --> 00:39:42,718
Are you alright?

239
00:39:43,298 --> 00:39:45,676
- Kill them!
- I'll get them.

240
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:34,933
Say your prayers, pilgrims.

241
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:39,187
- Hey, brothers.
- What?

242
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:42,149
- The view's better from here.
- Here we come.

243
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:47,404
We're coming for you, boys.

244
00:40:47,487 --> 00:40:49,205
Make a run for it!

245
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:54,665
Too late for prayers,
you're as good as dead.

246
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:07,389
Don't listen to them.

247
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:10,389
I'm not scared.

248
00:41:13,805 --> 00:41:15,807
Remember our father.

249
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:17,984
“The strong eat the weak.”

250
00:41:18,518 --> 00:41:20,395
We're stronger than them.

251
00:41:25,108 --> 00:41:27,327
Get some sleep, brothers.

252
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:41,082
Don't sleep, little doggies!

253
00:41:44,252 --> 00:41:50,100
Hey, I think
they've really fallen asleep!

254
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:53,144
- They're dreaming.
- Hey, boys,

255
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:55,597
no sleeping in bandit country.

256
00:41:57,015 --> 00:41:58,688
Don't sleep.

257
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:03,401
- Hilayal, let's wake them.
- Good idea.

258
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,782
Listen.

259
00:42:15,742 --> 00:42:17,619
If anything happens,

260
00:42:18,578 --> 00:42:20,797
climb up the mountain.

261
00:42:22,999 --> 00:42:25,969
When it's safe, wait by the well.
Someone will come.

262
00:42:28,129 --> 00:42:29,722
You hear?

263
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:34,639
You hear?

264
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:37,180
Ihean

265
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:10,380
Get up, Theeb!

266
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:33,119
Hussein!

267
00:43:36,364 --> 00:43:38,037
He got away, kill him!

268
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:07,903
Where's the boy?

269
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:20,241
Little doggy?

270
00:44:26,247 --> 00:44:28,045
He's in the well.

271
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:31,631
Why are you hiding,
little doggy?

272
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:39,476
I missed him.

273
00:44:39,552 --> 00:44:41,054
Cut the rope.

274
00:49:05,276 --> 00:49:06,778
Hussein!

275
00:49:13,868 --> 00:49:15,541
Hussein.

276
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:17,496
Answer me, Hussein.

277
00:49:22,418 --> 00:49:23,886
Hussein!

278
00:49:32,136 --> 00:49:33,638
Hussein.

279
00:49:34,388 --> 00:49:35,605
Hussein.

280
00:54:16,712 --> 00:54:19,591
Over here!

281
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:24,269
I'm over here.

282
00:55:13,185 --> 00:55:14,562
Hey.

283
00:55:21,193 --> 00:55:22,570
Please, man.

284
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:24,413
Hey.

285
00:55:30,911 --> 00:55:32,709
Answer me.

286
00:55:34,081 --> 00:55:36,254
I'm begging you, answer.

287
01:00:11,525 --> 01:00:12,651
Water.

288
01:00:20,784 --> 01:00:22,206
Water.

289
01:01:08,582 --> 01:01:10,300
Let me drink.

290
01:01:42,199 --> 01:01:43,701
Get it over with.

291
01:01:53,585 --> 01:01:55,087
Get it over with.

292
01:02:06,348 --> 01:02:08,316
I swear I'll find you!

293
01:02:08,808 --> 01:02:10,776
I swear I'll kill you!

294
01:02:16,358 --> 01:02:17,985
Somebody help me!

295
01:02:18,652 --> 01:02:20,325
I'll get you, little dog.

296
01:02:22,656 --> 01:02:24,954
There's nobody out there.

297
01:02:26,785 --> 01:02:28,583
Help me!

298
01:02:29,496 --> 01:02:31,919
I'm the only one
who can help you!

299
01:02:35,585 --> 01:02:37,087
Help me!

300
01:03:32,392 --> 01:03:33,894
That's dangerous!

301
01:04:33,286 --> 01:04:34,708
Don't be scared.

302
01:04:35,372 --> 01:04:37,045
Don't be scared.

303
01:04:39,793 --> 01:04:41,295
Don't be scared.

304
01:04:44,631 --> 01:04:46,474
Why were you
with the Englishman?

305
01:04:52,847 --> 01:04:54,724
- Shut up.
- Silence.

306
01:04:55,475 --> 01:04:57,148
Did I bring you here?

307
01:04:57,644 --> 01:05:00,022
Your people put you in this mess.

308
01:05:01,481 --> 01:05:03,279
You killed them.

309
01:05:03,358 --> 01:05:06,532
Didn't I say,
“Surrender and you'll have peace”?

310
01:05:06,861 --> 01:05:08,078
And what did you do?

311
01:05:09,656 --> 01:05:13,081
You shot me!
So don't blame me.

312
01:05:15,495 --> 01:05:19,045
God sent me so that
the beasts don't eat you.

313
01:05:21,459 --> 01:05:23,177
I don't need you.

314
01:05:23,795 --> 01:05:25,388
You're sure?

315
01:05:25,964 --> 01:05:27,341
You don't need me?

316
01:05:28,425 --> 01:05:30,268
The trail is clear.

317
01:05:30,969 --> 01:05:33,518
Take my camel as blood money.

318
01:05:36,975 --> 01:05:38,522
What are you waiting for?

319
01:05:41,354 --> 01:05:43,777
Because you're a helpless rabbit.

320
01:05:44,441 --> 01:05:48,036
Worse.
At least a rabbit can survive alone.

321
01:05:48,945 --> 01:05:51,073
Maybe I'll let the beasts eat you.

322
01:05:56,619 --> 01:05:58,292
Until the morning.

323
01:07:19,202 --> 01:07:20,624
Sleep.

324
01:07:58,324 --> 01:07:59,826
Clean the bread.

325
01:08:18,928 --> 01:08:22,523
God punish them
for not cleaning my wound.

326
01:08:22,599 --> 01:08:24,101
Who?

327
01:08:30,356 --> 01:08:32,859
They never appreciated
the value of brotherhood.

328
01:08:55,006 --> 01:08:56,553
Don't betray me.

329
01:09:34,921 --> 01:09:36,138
Come here.

330
01:09:45,973 --> 01:09:49,443
Take the dagger
and dig the bullet out.

331
01:09:55,441 --> 01:09:57,114
Dig it out with the tip.

332
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:01,118
Use the dagger's tip.

333
01:10:54,459 --> 01:10:56,507
Put the dagger in the fire.

334
01:10:59,297 --> 01:11:00,799
Put it in the fire.

335
01:11:15,980 --> 01:11:18,984
Come here. Leave it.

336
01:11:20,318 --> 01:11:21,740
Come here.

337
01:11:29,035 --> 01:11:30,787
It's loaded.

338
01:11:31,621 --> 01:11:35,251
If anything happens to me,
protect us.

339
01:11:38,878 --> 01:11:40,130
Take it.

340
01:11:42,507 --> 01:11:44,384
Give me the dagger.

341
01:12:36,394 --> 01:12:38,522
You fed us well.

342
01:13:04,964 --> 01:13:06,432
- No.
- No?

343
01:13:29,155 --> 01:13:30,907
That's the Englishman's.

344
01:13:36,245 --> 01:13:39,089
- What's your name?
- Theeb.

345
01:13:41,834 --> 01:13:43,336
Theeb?

346
01:13:50,092 --> 01:13:52,515
Is that your tribe's mark
on the box?

347
01:14:01,187 --> 01:14:04,191
Who's Sheikh Abu Hmoud to you?

348
01:14:05,733 --> 01:14:07,235
He's my father.

349
01:14:10,696 --> 01:14:13,575
The Wolf begets a Wolf.

350
01:14:16,035 --> 01:14:17,207
Here.

351
01:14:33,928 --> 01:14:40,982
<i>Wolf, I beseech you
don't eat the wolf</i>

352
01:14:43,229 --> 01:14:49,953
<i>How many nights did he feed you
when you were starving?</i>

353
01:14:50,653 --> 01:14:52,576
Sing with me, Wolf.

354
01:14:54,991 --> 01:15:02,250
<i>Wolf, I beseech you
don't eat the wolf</i>

355
01:15:03,916 --> 01:15:11,016
<i>How many nights did he feed you
when you were starving?</i>

356
01:15:31,485 --> 01:15:33,487
The departed never return.

357
01:17:42,199 --> 01:17:44,247
How do you track with the stars?

358
01:17:47,496 --> 01:17:50,340
Put the North Star
between your eyes.

359
01:17:55,629 --> 01:17:57,802
And the South Star
between your shoulders.

360
01:18:08,309 --> 01:18:10,812
- What's our direction?
- West.

361
01:18:11,145 --> 01:18:12,442
Right.

362
01:18:25,910 --> 01:18:29,039
- What's that?
- The iron donkey.

363
01:18:29,121 --> 01:18:31,840
- What?
- You'll see.

364
01:18:36,754 --> 01:18:38,848
This is what destroyed us.

365
01:18:40,966 --> 01:18:42,559
What is it?

366
01:18:43,135 --> 01:18:45,058
The iron donkey trail.

367
01:18:46,931 --> 01:18:48,433
What's it for?

368
01:18:49,391 --> 01:18:53,897
Pilgrims and Ottoman soldiers ride it.

369
01:18:56,315 --> 01:19:01,367
A month by camel
now takes a week by train.

370
01:19:27,054 --> 01:19:28,431
We're not raiders.

371
01:19:29,139 --> 01:19:30,516
You're revolutionaries.

372
01:19:30,599 --> 01:19:34,729
If you know us,
who are you?

373
01:19:35,354 --> 01:19:38,699
- I'm a pilgrim guide.
- Aren't you obsolete?

374
01:19:39,692 --> 01:19:41,194
I'm the last one.

375
01:19:43,654 --> 01:19:44,906
Who's this pilgrim?

376
01:19:45,698 --> 01:19:47,166
That's Hmoud.

377
01:19:49,326 --> 01:19:51,875
You going to Mecca, Hmoud?

378
01:19:53,872 --> 01:19:54,919
Yes.

379
01:19:55,791 --> 01:19:57,464
Mecca's behind you.

380
01:19:59,003 --> 01:20:01,631
I'm taking him
to the train station.

381
01:20:01,714 --> 01:20:02,715
<i>Bad idea.</i>

382
01:20:04,925 --> 01:20:06,393
That's none of your business.

383
01:20:06,719 --> 01:20:08,892
Where did you get that pistol?

384
01:20:11,974 --> 01:20:14,318
Is it strange to carry guns?

385
01:20:14,393 --> 01:20:18,489
There are no English pistols
around here.

386
01:20:19,898 --> 01:20:21,571
I bought it in Egypt.

387
01:20:22,943 --> 01:20:25,412
Have you seen an Englishman?

388
01:20:26,530 --> 01:20:29,124
In Egypt,
I bought the gun from one.

389
01:20:30,784 --> 01:20:34,254
And Hmoud,
did you see an Englishman?

390
01:20:37,583 --> 01:20:39,210
What's an Englishman?

391
01:20:45,257 --> 01:20:46,759
We have a long journey.

392
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:49,137
Time to go.

393
01:20:51,180 --> 01:20:56,277
Avoid the railway.
We have business with the Ottomans.

394
01:20:56,977 --> 01:20:59,821
Go in peace. Safe journey.

395
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:24,005
I've met all kinds of people.

396
01:21:26,173 --> 01:21:28,801
Anyone from wise men to merchants.

397
01:21:30,969 --> 01:21:34,064
I even took a ship captain to Mecca.

398
01:21:35,432 --> 01:21:37,150
What's a ship captain?

399
01:21:37,976 --> 01:21:40,399
They guide people at sea.

400
01:21:45,484 --> 01:21:47,282
I've never seen the sea.

401
01:21:50,864 --> 01:21:52,582
I've seen two.

402
01:21:54,493 --> 01:21:56,336
The Red Sea...

403
01:21:58,247 --> 01:22:00,249
and the Palestine sea.

404
01:22:00,999 --> 01:22:03,343
I've traveled all over.

405
01:22:04,461 --> 01:22:07,180
I've seen Jerusalem and al-Sham.

406
01:22:09,341 --> 01:22:13,391
Everywhere from Baghdad
to Al-Madinah al-Munawwarah.

407
01:22:16,515 --> 01:22:18,188
<i>WW (M you stop'?</i>

408
01:22:23,188 --> 01:22:24,906
They stopped me.

409
01:22:26,191 --> 01:22:28,865
The train came and ruined everything.

410
01:22:29,695 --> 01:22:33,871
All my forefathers were pilgrim guides.

411
01:22:35,325 --> 01:22:37,544
They left us in dark times,

412
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:41,124
without means or opportunity.

413
01:22:42,541 --> 01:22:44,509
And so brother killed brother.

414
01:23:09,735 --> 01:23:11,954
The strong eat the weak.

415
01:23:22,706 --> 01:23:24,800
Those are your Englishman's friends.

416
01:23:28,921 --> 01:23:30,389
What happened?

417
01:23:31,089 --> 01:23:32,591
The train.

418
01:23:33,592 --> 01:23:34,969
Madmen.

419
01:23:35,761 --> 01:23:38,264
You can't stop a spear
with your hand.

420
01:24:20,639 --> 01:24:24,394
Put the saddle on
and stay with the camel.

421
01:24:25,018 --> 01:24:26,520
I won't be long.

422
01:24:43,954 --> 01:24:45,331
What do you want?

423
01:24:46,081 --> 01:24:48,504
- The lieutenant.
- Go on.

424
01:27:00,382 --> 01:27:01,679
Come forward.

425
01:28:14,331 --> 01:28:17,426
- Where did you get it?
- From Egypt.

426
01:29:19,729 --> 01:29:20,855
That's my son.

427
01:29:26,111 --> 01:29:27,829
Stay with the camel.

428
01:29:33,910 --> 01:29:35,412
What's his name?

429
01:29:36,913 --> 01:29:40,508
Theeb,
my right hand on the trail.

430
01:29:44,796 --> 01:29:46,298
Here, Theeb.

431
01:29:56,057 --> 01:29:57,274
Take it, Theeb.

432
01:30:04,482 --> 01:30:05,904
Take it, Theeb.

433
01:30:20,540 --> 01:30:22,759
Go to the camel.
I'll follow you.

434
01:32:02,559 --> 01:32:04,106
Drop the gun!

435
01:32:05,103 --> 01:32:06,525
Drop it, boy!

436
01:32:39,637 --> 01:32:41,480
He killed my brother.

437
01:32:48,605 --> 01:32:49,822
Go home.

438
01:32:54,027 --> 01:32:55,529
Get rid of him.
