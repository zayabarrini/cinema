- Sorry.

168
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:10,283
Don't wake him up in his dreams.

Maybe he have a good dream, you know.

Really?

187
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,195
Stop pretending!

188
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:36,705
Bad girl! Bad girl!

OK, I'm going to return the beer.

00:18:09,055 --> 00:18:12,036
Not, that's not peanuts. That's Turkish.

00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:14,763
What's that'?

Blinker used to steal
these pizza mopeds...

317
00:28:09,321 --> 00:28:11,198
He stole these pizza scooters.

00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:15,236
I don't stole it for the scooter.

329
00:28:57,736 --> 00:29:00,683
But what's the relation with the tattoo?

330
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:06,253
I'm not a bad guy. I just...

Who cares'?

334
00:29:16,388 --> 00:29:18,527
He was in jail...

335
00:29:19,124 --> 00:29:23,436
You were in jail?
Yeah. Blinker visited him. Three times'?

336
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:31,137
Sister, I visit him three times. I give
him everything he want. What he want.

337

He was really a good friend.

Thanks, sister.

344
00:29:58,096 --> 00:30:03,102

467
00:39:19,958 --> 00:39:24,031
OK, maybe it's because I'm not into it
right now, but I show you something.

468
00:39:24,462 --> 00:39:28,467
- Just with my eyes closed.
- OK.

469
00:39:34,005 --> 00:39:36,383
- Thank you very much.
- So good!

470
00:39:36,507 --> 00:39:39,215
Your face was so deep in...
ll was like...

471
00:39:39,477 --> 00:39:41,923
Yeah, because it was deep. OK.

472
00:39:47,352 --> 00:39:49,354
I know I'm good.
I know I'm good.

473
00:39:49,587 --> 00:39:52,727
Yeah, you're so good I think
I'm falling in love with you right now.

474
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:56,504
Really? Same!

475
00:40:00,665 --> 00:40:04,738
But do you play an instrument?
Yes. One.

476
00:40:05,169 --> 00:40:09,709
One? What kind of instrument?
Guess what.

477
00:40:13,711 --> 00:40:15,713
There's <i>so</i> many...

478
00:40:18,549 --> 00:40:22,861
At the first time I thought
you are more a triangle guy'?

479
00:40:22,954 --> 00:40:27,232
Really? I look like that?
Yeah, you look like a little bit...

480
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:32,032
But different. You put triangle
like this... like a "V".

481
00:40:33,064 --> 00:40:38,275
And if you look like this now'? How I look?
I look like a triangle girl also?

482
00:40:38,469 --> 00:40:41,126
But it's a compliment!
That's a compliment?

483
00:40:41,152 --> 00:40:43,807
I think you should go out
of my cafe right now.

484
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:49,149
OK, now I know what you're playing.
What?

485
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:56,629
A drummer... No, no, not drummer. Yeah,
a drummer, but I think you are a drummer...

486
00:40:57,221 --> 00:41:02,728
You're from Madrid, right? You are
one of the best drummer from Real Madrid.

487
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:08,308
From Real Madrid, you are in the first row,
like 'You're Never Walk Alone'? - OK.

488
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:12,774
But it Might be? You look like it Also.
No, no, please.

489
00:41:13,104 --> 00:41:16,916
No, no, for real. What do you play?
I play this.

490
00:41:17,075 --> 00:41:20,750
You play piano?
Yeah. I am the daughter of Mozart.

491
00:41:21,746 --> 00:41:24,249
You're not the daughter.
I should know you if...

492
00:41:24,449 --> 00:41:26,827
No, really? You play piano?
Yeah.

493
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:28,828
You saw I'm really good in it.

494
00:41:28,953 --> 00:41:31,832
Yeah, and I was like "Woah!"
You should be my teacher!

495
00:41:31,956 --> 00:41:36,530
I can practice you everything, no problem.
Just give me time. It's expensive.

496
00:41:36,694 --> 00:41:37,695
That's the thing, you know'?

497
00:41:37,795 --> 00:41:40,207
You're so expensive?
I'm really expensive!

498
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:42,277
OK, but I'm going to give you a cacao.
OK. OK.

499
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:47,108
So now just show me
what you have just learned already?

500
00:41:47,472 --> 00:41:51,181
Ah, come on...!
And then... Please! Hey, come on.

501
00:41:51,476 --> 00:41:54,480
Come on, come on!
I've also showed my skill.

502
00:41:55,713 --> 00:42:00,321
I just showed my skills already.
Now it's your turn.

503
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:02,221
It's just fair, you know'?

504
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:09,467
OK, Hake a chair, and...

505
00:42:09,794 --> 00:42:12,968
then please show me some skills.

506
00:42:15,633 --> 00:42:19,171
I'll be friendly. - OK.
I'll be friendly with you.

507
00:42:19,237 --> 00:42:23,379
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

508
00:42:27,578 --> 00:42:31,185
Just look at me?
You're going to be my muse now.

509
00:42:31,749 --> 00:42:35,697
I'm your muse. OK. I am.
What can I do?

510
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:39,529
I don't know. Look at me.
OK. I'll just...

511
00:45:08,239 --> 00:45:13,882
I never, ever... I never hear
something like this before. Really.

512
00:45:18,015 --> 00:45:23,431
Show me your hands.
It's like wonder hands.

513
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:26,099
- Really!
- They're just hands.

514
00:45:26,257 --> 00:45:28,328
No.

515
00:45:35,533 --> 00:45:37,604
What's the name of the song'?

516
00:45:38,069 --> 00:45:40,413
It's "Mephisto Waltz". You know'?

517
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:42,718
- Mephisto'?
- Yes.

518
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:46,879
Mephisto, he's like a devil, huh'?

519
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:51,025
Yeah, it's the devil.
I like the devil.

520
00:45:51,115 --> 00:45:53,459
Yeah, me too.

521
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:00,360
But one question. Really...

522
00:46:04,262 --> 00:46:06,708
Why you don't play...'?
You have to play...

523
00:46:06,797 --> 00:46:09,869
Not why. You have to play in concert halls.

524
00:46:09,934 --> 00:46:12,881
You have to do something like this!

525
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:16,975
That was so cool!
It was like you're telling a story.

526
00:46:17,074 --> 00:46:20,749
It was like... Cool, man!

527
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:26,057
It's not cool. - Wait, you have
something here, on your mouth.

528
00:46:26,884 --> 00:46:30,161
I'm sorry. But it was nice.

529
00:46:30,421 --> 00:46:32,094
No, really. You have to play there.

530
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:39,438
I've been... I've been...
I don't know the name, how you say that.

531
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:43,070
I've been... in the
conservatory, you know'?

532
00:46:44,068 --> 00:46:45,274
I was in the conservatory...

533
00:46:45,403 --> 00:46:48,475
and I cannot continue in the
conservatory because I'm not good enough.

534
00:46:48,939 --> 00:46:54,252
They said me just to finish my piano career
or something like that...

535
00:46:57,081 --> 00:46:59,152
Because they're stupid, or what?

536
00:46:59,984 --> 00:47:02,487
No, it's OK. I prefer that.
No, really...

537
00:47:04,021 --> 00:47:08,333
Because it's amazing.
It's like. You know, I...

538
00:47:10,261 --> 00:47:13,140
No, it's not amazing...

539
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:19,804
I don't know. I've been sixteen and a half
years practicing playing the piano...

540
00:47:19,937 --> 00:47:23,282
every day, like seven hours every day.

541
00:47:24,108 --> 00:47:28,056
Seven is the maximum. You cannot play more
because you're gonna hurt your arms.

542
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:32,620
And it's a really hard life,
because you have no...

543
00:47:33,351 --> 00:47:36,389
you have no life. You have no friends.

544
00:47:36,487 --> 00:47:41,493
Well, the friends are like the other guys
that are in the conservatory...

545
00:47:41,959 --> 00:47:45,133
but they are not your friends really.

546
00:47:45,229 --> 00:47:48,301
They're like your enemies.
Yeah, I know what you mean.

547
00:47:48,966 --> 00:47:52,209
Because they are fighting
for your dream too.

548
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:55,414
But was it your dream... to play'?

549
00:47:55,639 --> 00:47:57,585
Not any more.

550
00:47:58,342 --> 00:48:01,186
No. Because it's...
You are... You...

551
00:48:01,679 --> 00:48:04,853
You can became a bad...

552
00:48:05,383 --> 00:48:10,992
I don't know. I was just thinking, for my
friends, they should fail in their exams...

553
00:48:11,155 --> 00:48:16,605
"because then I would have, like, more
opportunities for me, and it was just..."

554
00:48:17,161 --> 00:48:19,107
because our teacher said to us that...

555
00:48:20,264 --> 00:48:24,440
just the 90% of us,
we are lasing our lime.

556
00:48:25,169 --> 00:48:27,911
It's really difficult to be...
No. But I know...

557
00:48:28,372 --> 00:48:32,013
It's really difficult to became
a real pianist player.

558
00:48:32,543 --> 00:48:36,389
And it's better like this.
You know, when I was 12...

559
00:48:37,281 --> 00:48:41,923
I can remember. I was
like an old lady...

560
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:45,225
just playing always the fucking piano.

561
00:48:45,289 --> 00:48:47,132
Hey, chin up...

562
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:52,136
Heads high.

563
00:48:52,363 --> 00:48:56,539
For me, I just want to tell you... wait...
it was wonderful, really.

564
00:48:57,034 --> 00:49:00,743
It was so... One second. Wait.

565
00:49:00,871 --> 00:49:02,111
Yo, my man.

566
00:49:03,641 --> 00:49:06,315
I'm here, in the cafe.

567
00:49:10,981 --> 00:49:13,928
Why did he call'?

568
00:49:14,985 --> 00:49:18,489
I'm in the cafe, dude!

569
00:49:18,989 --> 00:49:20,991
Man! At the...

570
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:24,937
at The organic cafe.
What does he want'?

571
00:49:25,763 --> 00:49:27,674
Yeah, what do you want'?

572
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:29,175
Hello'?

573
00:49:35,105 --> 00:49:39,281
- What?
- No. Everything's OK.

574
00:49:45,115 --> 00:49:49,655
But I'm glad to be here. In Berlin.
That's good.

575
00:49:53,090 --> 00:49:57,129
What? What happens?

576
00:50:04,702 --> 00:50:08,275
I have to do Boxer a favour.
We have to go now to...

577
00:50:08,506 --> 00:50:11,316
".10 do some work."

578
00:50:11,442 --> 00:50:15,049
Now you have to work with tham?
Yeah, I have to go. Yeah, yeah.

579
00:50:17,214 --> 00:50:20,684
But are you OK?
Yeah, I'm OK. I'm just thinking.

580
00:50:23,521 --> 00:50:26,331
But it was really nice to meet you.

581
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:30,532
I hope, I hope...
Let's see each other again.

582
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:32,867
Yeah, I want to do that.

583
00:50:33,163 --> 00:50:38,203
Maybe I come to you...
Yeah. What about my cacao, by the way'?

584
00:50:45,175 --> 00:50:48,554
Now... I just...

585
00:50:48,979 --> 00:50:53,257
OK. Go. Go.

586
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:58,731
What's up?

587
00:50:58,989 --> 00:51:02,266
- He called.
- Yeah, you said!

588
00:51:03,327 --> 00:51:06,069
Can't I just talk in peace?
Let's go!

589
00:51:06,163 --> 00:51:08,905
What's going on?
Do we have to meet him'?

590
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:12,112
Of course we have to!
Yes, but why now?

591
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:31,024
- So let's go!
- OK!

592
00:51:31,221 --> 00:51:34,031
OK, retard!
Where are we going'?

593
00:51:34,858 --> 00:51:38,135
Boxer, where? We're going now.

594
00:51:39,863 --> 00:51:43,470
We're coming, Boxer!
We're coming with you!

595
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:10,738
I just wanted to say goodbye.
And not goodbye. It's 'til tomorrow.

596
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:17,176
It was really nice.
Yeah. For me too.

597
00:52:17,334 --> 00:52:21,646
Just come tomorrow for your cacao.
I come tomorrow, but...

598
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:24,445
but no! Today tomorrow... OK.

599
00:52:24,575 --> 00:52:30,184
New car. You have a new car.
We have a new car now. Yeah.

600
00:52:36,353 --> 00:52:40,165
Where are you going with this car'?
We have to do something.

601
00:52:44,762 --> 00:52:46,537
Just leave me alone...

602
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:48,940
I think Fuss is going to sleep in the car.

603
00:52:49,433 --> 00:52:52,380
I don't want to, but he does...

604
00:52:54,138 --> 00:52:57,608
Dude! What are you doing?

605
00:52:58,142 --> 00:52:59,644
Get on with it!

606
00:52:59,710 --> 00:53:02,213
I'll get in and shift across.

607
00:53:02,813 --> 00:53:06,283
Business people! Always a little bit crazy!
Yeah, OK.

608
00:53:07,618 --> 00:53:08,460
Front seat? OK!

609
00:53:08,519 --> 00:53:11,159
- Bye!
- OK. Let's go.

610
00:53:11,355 --> 00:53:13,130
- Peace!
- Bye!

611
00:54:46,984 --> 00:54:50,261
Victoria. I'm sorry!

612
00:54:50,721 --> 00:54:52,223
Hey! Wait outside.

613
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:53,893
- I'm very sorry.
- What?

614
00:54:53,991 --> 00:54:55,629
Do you have a water or something?

615
00:54:56,593 --> 00:54:58,470
Don't puke here, you retard!

616
00:54:58,562 --> 00:55:00,803
Everything's cool.

617
00:55:02,933 --> 00:55:06,346
Water, please. I've got water!

618
00:55:10,174 --> 00:55:11,676
Have a drink. Sit up.

619
00:55:11,775 --> 00:55:15,018
Nu, the machine is not open.
I have water.

620
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:18,523
Fuss is really drunk.

621
00:55:18,782 --> 00:55:22,594
He's drunk. It's his birthday.
I know. I know.

622
00:55:23,787 --> 00:55:26,825
Calm down, Fuss. Breathe deep.

623
00:55:26,924 --> 00:55:29,530
Dude, like this.

624
00:55:29,693 --> 00:55:32,333
Relax, everything's cool.

625
00:55:32,496 --> 00:55:34,635
Wake up, man!

626
00:55:35,299 --> 00:55:38,212
Maybe the cacao's for him.

627
00:55:38,502 --> 00:55:40,448
Get your shit together.
We've got ten minutes.

628
00:55:40,537 --> 00:55:43,143
He'll make it!

629
00:55:47,544 --> 00:55:49,546
Man! Just fuck it!

630
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:52,661
Call him and tell him it's off! Fuck it!

631
00:55:52,816 --> 00:55:55,353
We can't!
We don't have to do it tonight!

632
00:55:55,452 --> 00:55:57,557
He wants four of us!
But not tonight!

633
00:55:57,688 --> 00:55:59,690
I gave him my word!

634
00:55:59,823 --> 00:56:02,201
Boys! Relax! Don't let me down!

635
00:56:02,392 --> 00:56:04,736
Don't let me down! Get up, man!

636
00:56:04,895 --> 00:56:08,866
Boxer, three's enough!
He just wants us in and out...

637
00:56:09,399 --> 00:56:11,470
He doesn't want any stress!

638
00:56:11,535 --> 00:56:13,572
What happens? What's going on'?

639
00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:14,950
Fuss isn't going to be any help.

640
00:56:14,972 --> 00:56:17,816
Just call him and postpone it!

641
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:21,887
We can't Postpone! I owe him!

642
00:56:22,312 --> 00:56:24,189
You know what I mean!

643
00:56:25,415 --> 00:56:26,416
What happened'?

644
00:56:26,583 --> 00:56:31,589
Let's just go, the three of us,
bang bang, and out!

645
00:56:31,889 --> 00:56:33,698
Right, Boxer'?

646
00:56:33,924 --> 00:56:36,598
Three? Three guys! One driver!

647
00:56:36,894 --> 00:56:38,840
What don't you get'?

648
00:56:38,896 --> 00:56:40,239
What happened'?

649
00:56:42,833 --> 00:56:44,369
Tell me.

650
00:56:45,736 --> 00:56:48,740
Ask her to come along.
I don't Care.

651
00:56:48,906 --> 00:56:51,682
Quick job, then back to the cafe.

652
00:56:51,909 --> 00:56:55,288
Ask her!
Are you crazy? We just met!

653
00:56:55,612 --> 00:56:56,590
Just do it!

654
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:59,889
Dun'! Touch me, retard!
I hate that!

655
00:57:00,851 --> 00:57:02,558
Boxer, don't touch me!

656
00:57:02,619 --> 00:57:04,758
Ask her!
I will. Shut the fuck up!

657
00:57:04,922 --> 00:57:06,094
Sonne, what happened'?

658
00:57:06,223 --> 00:57:08,703
Come on, Fuss, let's go.
What happened?

659
00:57:08,892 --> 00:57:11,429
- Get out!
- Just fuck off!

660
00:57:11,695 --> 00:57:15,142
Hey, wail. No, no. It's OK.
Just let them go.

661
00:57:15,732 --> 00:57:17,643
You know...

662
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:27,085
You don't have to do this.
Really, you don't have to do this. But...

663
00:57:28,745 --> 00:57:31,885
Boxer. He was in jail, yeah'?

664
00:57:32,049 --> 00:57:35,656
And there was some guys
giving him protections. Like...

665
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:40,233
the guys do him a favour...

666
00:57:40,490 --> 00:57:43,903
now he have to do something for him.
For this guy.

667
00:57:44,094 --> 00:57:47,803
And now we have to go
there with four guys...

668
00:57:47,965 --> 00:57:50,070
and Fuss is completely...

669
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:52,113
Man, fuck you! Wait.

670
00:57:52,169 --> 00:57:55,582
Piss off! I'm asking her now!

671
00:57:56,006 --> 00:57:57,952
Then let's go!

672
00:58:02,112 --> 00:58:03,614
You know...'?

673
00:58:04,281 --> 00:58:07,694
You know...'?
You just have to...

674
00:58:09,853 --> 00:58:13,528
Please can you help us'?
We just go there...

675
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:16,694
and after this bring you back
to the cafe no problem.

676
00:58:16,927 --> 00:58:19,635
We just need now help because...

677
00:58:19,796 --> 00:58:23,835
Boxer is in trouble if not, you know.
OK.

678
00:58:24,201 --> 00:58:28,650
And you need to be four'?
Yeah. I don't know why.

679
00:58:29,706 --> 00:58:32,482
I just drive you there
and then I come back?

680
00:58:32,642 --> 00:58:36,522
We bring you back.
We bring you back, no problem. - OK.

681
00:58:36,713 --> 00:58:38,954
- Nu problem.
- Yeah?

682
00:58:43,687 --> 00:58:47,829
It's something bad to do, or...'?

683
00:58:51,695 --> 00:58:55,575
We've got five minutes.
Five fucking minutes.

684
00:59:01,004 --> 00:59:06,181
It's something not... After, maybe
it's something bad. But it's not about you.

685
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:09,683
You know, we just go there
and bring you back.

686
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:13,191
Really, that's not bad for you. OK'?

687
00:59:13,316 --> 00:59:17,765
Really. I swear. It's not bad for you.
OK. I go. Yeah?

688
00:59:29,666 --> 00:59:32,510
I was talking to a girl, you wanker.

689
00:59:32,936 --> 00:59:34,609
Are you stupid?
I was asking her!

690
00:59:34,905 --> 00:59:39,376
And don't talk to me like a retard!
I hate that!

691
00:59:39,576 --> 00:59:41,180
She's doing it! Just calm down.

692
00:59:41,344 --> 00:59:44,086
You need to calm down!
You both need to calm down.

693
00:59:47,184 --> 00:59:50,028
Sister. You drive.
Yeah, I drive.

694
00:59:50,287 --> 00:59:53,894
I'm the big driver!
Are you OK. Right. Guys'!

695
00:59:54,257 --> 00:59:55,895
We are perfect!

696
00:59:56,026 --> 00:59:57,300
Let her drive!

697
00:59:59,129 --> 01:00:02,235
Let her drive. You don't have
a license, you stupid wanker!

698
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:06,609
Do you know how to drive automatic'?
Yeah, of course!

699
01:00:07,237 --> 01:00:10,548
You can drive?
Of course. I'm the fucking driver!

700
01:00:12,409 --> 01:00:16,152
You will see.
Everything is cool, sister.

701
01:00:17,647 --> 01:00:19,285
What?

702
01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:24,765
- I don't like it.
- How is that?

703
01:00:24,821 --> 01:00:27,062
He's such a moron.

704
01:00:33,797 --> 01:00:35,799
What happens with him'?

705
01:00:41,571 --> 01:00:42,914
How do you say 'gerade aus"?

706
01:00:42,973 --> 01:00:44,145
Just straight. Man.

707
01:00:44,274 --> 01:00:46,845
- Straight?
- Just go.

708
01:00:47,777 --> 01:00:49,950
I'm gonna drive you. Man.

709
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:52,287
Now be nice to her. Please!

710
01:00:59,289 --> 01:01:01,291
Where's Fuss'?

711
01:01:01,358 --> 01:01:02,928
Fuss, brother?

712
01:01:03,126 --> 01:01:06,664
Can you all be quiet a moment'?

713
01:01:06,763 --> 01:01:10,267
Fuss is knocked out, but it's OK.

714
01:01:16,373 --> 01:01:18,375
Quit laughing, man!

715
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:23,957
What do you have to do there'?

716
01:01:25,448 --> 01:01:27,519
It's just a meeting.

717
01:01:30,487 --> 01:01:32,398
- Go right?
- Yes, right.

718
01:01:32,656 --> 01:01:35,227
Dude, she gut it!
Just call her she's safe, OK'?

719
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:40,740
Shut the fuck up.
I took care of that, wanker.

720
01:01:40,897 --> 01:01:44,037
Yeah, man, Boxer,
he really did.

721
01:01:49,406 --> 01:01:52,546
We'll just talk there, right'?

722
01:01:52,842 --> 01:01:55,345
So what are we doing?
No plan, dude!

723
01:01:55,412 --> 01:02:00,020
He wants to see we're ready.
Exactly. It's a test!

724
01:02:00,083 --> 01:02:02,154
Thanks for your wisdom, Blinker!

725
01:02:02,219 --> 01:02:04,665
Calm the fuck down!

726
01:02:14,264 --> 01:02:18,269
Afterwards we're bringing
her straight back.

727
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:23,510
I don't want...
I don't want to talk about it.

728
01:02:24,207 --> 01:02:26,949
Sonne. Of course we'll bring her back!

729
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:31,123
I don't want to talk about it.

730
01:02:47,230 --> 01:02:51,110
I'm fucked. No: I'm good!

731
01:02:51,201 --> 01:02:58,244
We're meeting a real gangster.
That's interesting!

732
01:02:58,742 --> 01:03:00,983
Shut! The fuck! Up!

733
01:03:01,144 --> 01:03:05,058
Got it, Boxer.
Everything's cool.

734
01:03:05,982 --> 01:03:07,825
Give me another, please.

735
01:03:07,984 --> 01:03:10,487
Stop frightening the girl, retard!

736
01:03:10,587 --> 01:03:12,225
We're not frightening her.

737
01:03:16,926 --> 01:03:19,634
Where are we going'?

738
01:03:19,829 --> 01:03:24,107
Where are you going, man'?
With this shitty stolen car?

739
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:25,741
Boxer. Where are we going'?

740
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:30,649
Stop calling it a fucking stolen car.
It'll scare her.

741
01:03:30,907 --> 01:03:34,013
She doesn't understand,
so shut the fuck up.

742
01:03:38,848 --> 01:03:40,657
- Sonne '?
- What'?

743
01:03:42,285 --> 01:03:43,923
Wait, wait, wait! Here.

744
01:03:44,087 --> 01:03:46,499
You're not afraid, are you'?
I'm not afraid.

745
01:03:46,790 --> 01:03:48,497
Put the car...

746
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:50,934
Here inside?
More, more, more...

747
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:54,335
OK, stop.

748
01:03:56,166 --> 01:04:00,444
Sonne, we'll make it.
Give me five.

749
01:04:03,373 --> 01:04:05,944
Victoria, everything OK?

750
01:04:06,209 --> 01:04:08,450
It's OK, right? Yeah, it's OK.

751
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:11,155
Are you OK, right'? Yeah, yeah.

752
01:04:26,396 --> 01:04:28,569
OK, give me a light, please.

753
01:04:29,466 --> 01:04:30,536
Here, hang on.

754
01:04:45,648 --> 01:04:47,650
- He has a gun.
- Just go.

755
01:05:05,702 --> 01:05:07,272
Shit.

756
01:05:11,408 --> 01:05:13,081
Shit!

757
01:05:15,111 --> 01:05:17,216
Do we wail inside?

758
01:05:20,049 --> 01:05:21,960
Are you fucking serious?

759
01:05:23,186 --> 01:05:25,223
Get out.

760
01:05:35,865 --> 01:05:38,106
I'll be in touch.

761
01:05:57,787 --> 01:06:00,131
- These are your boys'?
- Yes.

762
01:06:00,623 --> 01:06:01,897
Who's the bitch'?

763
01:06:02,158 --> 01:06:04,900
Are you guys fucking her'?
The bitch is our driver.

764
01:06:05,128 --> 01:06:07,165
You don't say. Get out.

765
01:06:14,103 --> 01:06:16,481
You're the driver'?
Done this before'?

766
01:06:16,773 --> 01:06:18,582
I don't speak German.

767
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:21,451
What The fuck?
She doesn't speak German'?

768
01:06:30,153 --> 01:06:31,496
Your problem.

769
01:06:32,121 --> 01:06:33,691
Let's get your tools.

770
01:06:48,371 --> 01:06:50,715
Hand them round.
Are they loaded?

771
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:53,681
Yes. You wanna throw candy?

772
01:06:54,711 --> 01:06:56,281
Come with me.

773
01:06:58,381 --> 01:07:00,122
The bitch, too.

774
01:07:04,287 --> 01:07:08,497
What's happening?
Everything is OK. Just be quiet.

775
01:07:21,804 --> 01:07:27,049
This is the floor plan for a private bank,
Limburg <i>&</i> Co, Zimmerstrasse 26.

776
01:07:27,243 --> 01:07:31,419
There's 50,000 Euro in a small safe
for a customer, Mr Weigert.

777
01:07:31,681 --> 01:07:35,424
He'll collect the money at 7 am
to buy a vintage car.

778
01:07:35,585 --> 01:07:37,496
You'll be there already.

779
01:07:37,654 --> 01:07:40,191
Ten grand's for me.
The rest is for you.

780
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:47,374
Right now?

781
01:07:48,331 --> 01:07:50,777
Yes. You got something better to do'?

782
01:07:54,604 --> 01:07:56,277
Well...

783
01:08:02,779 --> 01:08:05,282
You don't have to.
I can't force you.

784
01:08:08,184 --> 01:08:10,630
Then we won't. We won't do it.

785
01:08:10,853 --> 01:08:15,029
Boxer, back in jail you
enjoyed my protection.

786
01:08:15,191 --> 01:08:19,071
You owe me. Ten grand.
And I want that money.

787
01:08:20,430 --> 01:08:21,966
I'll get the money.

788
01:08:23,433 --> 01:08:28,314
You had no money for cigarettes
and now you'll find ten grand?

789
01:08:31,307 --> 01:08:33,480
Give me a week, OK'?

790
01:08:34,243 --> 01:08:36,655
One week? OK.

791
01:08:37,113 --> 01:08:39,389
While you're getting the money.

792
01:08:39,449 --> 01:08:41,622
I'll keep the bitch.

793
01:08:46,489 --> 01:08:48,969
We'll do it. We'll do it!

794
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:52,572
Hey, we'll do it, OK?

795
01:08:52,829 --> 01:08:55,070
We'll do it, man!

796
01:09:01,904 --> 01:09:03,941
- OK. Are you sure'?
- Yes.

797
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:06,447
- Yes.
- Goad.

798
01:09:06,743 --> 01:09:11,089
So, this is the entrance.
ATM, two security doors.

799
01:09:11,314 --> 01:09:12,850
Here's the counter.

800
01:09:12,949 --> 01:09:17,455
Six desks for the account managers.
Over here is the main target.

801
01:09:18,187 --> 01:09:21,930
Mrs Neumann sits here.
She's the bank manager.

802
01:09:22,025 --> 01:09:26,770
She has the alarm codes
and the combination for the small safe.

803
01:09:27,697 --> 01:09:29,870
Mr Weigert will collect the money at 7 am.

804
01:09:29,966 --> 01:09:33,846
Mrs Neumann and two clerks
will be in the bank then.

805
01:09:34,037 --> 01:09:37,211
The second clerk arrives
between 6:30 and 6:45.

806
01:09:37,306 --> 01:09:41,721
That's your target. She'll bring you
through the second security door.

807
01:09:42,512 --> 01:09:47,393
Alright? There's gloves and masks.
Show me what you've got.

808
01:09:50,853 --> 01:09:52,332
You stay here.

809
01:09:54,991 --> 01:09:56,664
- She stays with me.
- Yes.

810
01:10:02,532 --> 01:10:04,705
I hate you.

811
01:10:06,703 --> 01:10:08,410
Gimme that Shit!

812
01:10:16,079 --> 01:10:19,424
- Take some gloves.
- Got 'em.

813
01:10:20,983 --> 01:10:22,985
- We don't Have much time.
- Yes!

814
01:10:23,386 --> 01:10:24,660
OK, boss.

815
01:10:30,226 --> 01:10:31,330
Shit!

816
01:10:35,264 --> 01:10:37,005
Should we start in the car'?

817
01:10:37,233 --> 01:10:40,373
- Whatever.
- Let's start inside.

818
01:10:45,108 --> 01:10:46,951
Wait, the gloves!

819
01:10:47,410 --> 01:10:49,287
Go!

820
01:10:50,780 --> 01:10:53,021
- Wail, wail!
- Open the door!

821
01:10:53,583 --> 01:10:55,290
Open the door! Do it yourself!

822
01:10:55,718 --> 01:10:57,197
The lock, dude!

823
01:10:58,354 --> 01:10:59,628
Come on, come on!

824
01:11:02,692 --> 01:11:07,801
Let's go!
Everybody on the ground!

825
01:11:08,030 --> 01:11:11,068
Shut the fuck up!
No one make a move!

826
01:11:11,234 --> 01:11:14,374
Down on the ground!

827
01:11:14,737 --> 01:11:17,149
Shut the fuck up!

828
01:11:17,473 --> 01:11:19,953
I said, down on the ground!

829
01:11:20,076 --> 01:11:23,387

830
01:11:23,446 --> 01:11:25,323

01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:33,628
OK, stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

833
01:11:35,258 --> 01:11:37,238
Good. Who's the pressure guy'?

834
01:11:37,426 --> 01:11:38,769
Who's putting on the pressure'?

835
01:11:38,895 --> 01:11:40,897
Who's calling the shots'?

836
01:11:41,164 --> 01:11:42,609
He calls the shots.

837
01:11:42,665 --> 01:11:46,636
Don't all shout at once.
Mrs Neuman needs clear instructions.

838
01:11:46,903 --> 01:11:49,611
When you enter...
The door thing won't happen again.

839
01:11:49,839 --> 01:11:51,580
First leave the car...

840
01:11:51,641 --> 01:11:53,450
then go. Don't run!

841
01:11:53,509 --> 01:11:56,353
When you enter, two shots
to make things clear.

842
01:11:56,679 --> 01:11:57,953
What's the bank's name'?

843
01:11:58,080 --> 01:11:59,423

Tilidin, cocaine.

01:12:31,714 --> 01:12:34,957
Take some.
It makes you confident and aggressive.

852
01:12:35,618 --> 01:12:38,497

You first.

01:12:46,295 --> 01:12:48,707
A bit more, Boxer.

860
01:13:12,588 --> 01:13:18,334
Afterwards go home and stay put.

861
01:13:20,096 --> 01:13:21,541
Go!

862
01:14:30,066 --> 01:14:31,636

Boxer, what the fuck is this shit, man'?

866
01:14:46,749 --> 01:14:52,631
Victoria, I'm sorry, yeah. I'm very sorry.
Don't worry. I'm OK. Don't care.

867
01:14:53,122 --> 01:14:55,830
So, we go to the cafe, yeah'?

868
01:14:57,626 --> 01:15:02,837
Boxer. Man, I can't breathe!

869
01:15:03,799 --> 01:15:06,609
My heart! I can't breathe!

870
01:15:06,669 --> 01:15:08,774
Stop the car!

He's panicking! He's panicking!
Stop the car! Stop the car!

875
01:15:31,293 --> 01:15:33,739
I'm not joking! I'm not joking!

876
01:15:33,896 --> 01:15:36,809
I'm not Joking!
Open the fucking door.

877
01:15:42,972 --> 01:15:46,010
Boxer, Boxer, I can't.

878
01:15:46,342 --> 01:15:49,152
Help. My heart.

879
01:15:49,311 --> 01:15:51,086
Calm the fuck down!

880
01:15:56,652 --> 01:15:59,724
Get up, man! Get up!

Wait.

884
01:16:09,265 --> 01:16:13,714
It's OK. It's OK. It's OK.

885
01:16:20,776 --> 01:16:25,521
Breathe.
Breathe. Blinker, breathe.

886
01:16:34,423 --> 01:16:36,266
Stop it!

887
01:16:46,235 --> 01:16:48,442
I don't want to die.

888
01:16:58,747 --> 01:17:00,749
Guys, what's going on'?

889
01:17:06,822 --> 01:17:08,961
Give me the fucking cigarette.

890
01:17:14,830 --> 01:17:16,605
I'll do it alone.

891
01:17:22,471 --> 01:17:24,747
I come with you. I drive you.

892
01:17:49,865 --> 01:17:53,438
Guys, for once:
Everyone together.

893
01:17:54,003 --> 01:17:56,176
Come hers. Blinker, come here!

But we're taking her back first!

898
01:18:22,398 --> 01:18:26,403
Sonne. I want to go with you.

899
01:18:27,670 --> 01:18:28,910

902
01:19:49,585 --> 01:19:51,462
I'll take Mrs Neumann.

903
01:19:54,056 --> 01:19:56,969
I'll take Mrs Neumann...

904
01:19:58,427 --> 01:20:01,101
You keep the others covered.

905

We're doing this.
We're going to make it, OK'?

906
01:20:04,266 --> 01:20:09,181
Nice and easy. In and out. Two minutes.

907
01:20:10,005 --> 01:20:12,451
- OK?
- Yes, man!

908
01:20:12,941 --> 01:20:14,852
- OK, brother!
- Yeah?

909
01:21:03,192 --> 01:21:04,694
Go straight.

910
01:21:11,667 --> 01:21:14,079
It has to be there.

911
01:21:17,072 --> 01:21:18,710
Go. Go, go. Go.

912
01:21:26,248 --> 01:21:29,320
Go here. Stop right here.

913
01:21:29,418 --> 01:21:31,091
More. Go.

914
01:21:33,922 --> 01:21:36,528
Blinker, everything alright'?
What?

915
01:21:37,059 --> 01:21:42,873
Here turn the car, and you stop, OK.
And you wait. We come and we go.

916
01:21:43,832 --> 01:21:45,505
You turn around, OK'?

917
01:21:45,567 --> 01:21:47,410
I already told her.

918
01:21:52,408 --> 01:21:55,252
- Blinker, you're OK'?
- Yes.

919
01:22:00,449 --> 01:22:04,693
Hey. Blinker.
I'm calm, I'm calm, I'm calm...

920
01:22:11,427 --> 01:22:13,566
Is that her?

921
01:22:14,963 --> 01:22:16,601
Hey! Wait!

922
01:22:20,569 --> 01:22:22,480
Hey, that's her!

01:22:23,806 --> 01:22:26,309

Down on the ground!
I said, get down on the ground!

925
01:24:01,970 --> 01:24:05,543
Go! Go! Go! Go! Come on!

The car, the car is not Going on!

Throw it Out! Throw it out!

936
01:24:55,457 --> 01:24:57,733
Throw everything out!
Throw everything out!

937
01:24:59,194 --> 01:25:02,903
OK, now go right! Here! Here!
Right! Go here!

938
01:25:07,102 --> 01:25:08,103
Calm down.

939
01:25:15,077 --> 01:25:17,489
No, not Go back, go back! Go back.

940
01:25:17,746 --> 01:25:20,920
What the fuck?
Go back, sister. Go back. Go back.

941
01:25:21,049 --> 01:25:23,256
Relax. Please!

942
01:25:23,318 --> 01:25:26,265
Calm down, OK? Calm down.

943
01:25:28,957 --> 01:25:30,561
Calm down! Calm down!

944
01:25:38,300 --> 01:25:40,906
Sister, you go back.
Hey, calm down!

945
01:25:41,069 --> 01:25:43,447
Just think! Where are we going?

946
01:25:44,606 --> 01:25:48,349
We've got to get off the streets!

947
01:25:52,280 --> 01:25:54,089
Go safely, sister.

948
01:25:57,686 --> 01:26:00,257
- Right!
- Go here to the right!

949
01:26:04,292 --> 01:26:07,535
Let's get out of here!
Hide! Get down!

950
01:26:15,103 --> 01:26:18,209
Hey, now. Here right. Here. Here.

951
01:26:29,151 --> 01:26:32,792
Go here. Go in here.
Let's hide the car.

952
01:26:38,860 --> 01:26:42,364
Behind this, OK?
Go, go, go. Behind this.

953
01:26:49,204 --> 01:26:51,980
Stop the car. Stop you the car!

954
01:27:14,763 --> 01:27:17,004
Everything was OK'?

955
01:27:20,502 --> 01:27:22,209
Boxer. You whore.

956
01:27:25,340 --> 01:27:28,412
50,000 Euros!

957
01:27:30,345 --> 01:27:32,621
A pharmacy bag.

958
01:27:43,792 --> 01:27:48,400
That was some sick shit.
Show me: How much we got'?

959
01:27:52,601 --> 01:27:55,480
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm OK.

960
01:27:56,304 --> 01:27:59,979
Hey, guys!
I just want to say I love you.

961
01:28:00,475 --> 01:28:04,287
Boys, let's get going.
Grab your fucking guns!

962
01:28:06,648 --> 01:28:10,892
Guys! Sonne! Sonne!

963
01:28:11,219 --> 01:28:14,063
Grab all the shit.
Just lake everything.

964
01:28:14,256 --> 01:28:17,465
Grab the gun and don't leave a trace.

965
01:28:18,326 --> 01:28:19,964
Wipe them off!

966
01:28:42,584 --> 01:28:43,995
Let's go party, man!

967
01:28:46,321 --> 01:28:47,322
We do it!

968
01:28:47,455 --> 01:28:49,093
Let's go Party!

969
01:28:49,324 --> 01:28:51,668
- Wait, wait!
- Alright. Man.

970
01:28:53,094 --> 01:28:57,372
Now, I think... we need a drink!

971
01:28:57,999 --> 01:29:00,479
I think so, yeah.
You think also? Yeah!

972
01:29:00,535 --> 01:29:02,708
Throw away this shit.

973
01:29:05,540 --> 01:29:07,816
My jacket! Throw it Away, dude.

974
01:29:07,943 --> 01:29:10,116
- Hey, man!
- Fuck it.

975
01:29:34,870 --> 01:29:37,009
You're so fucking crazy!

976
01:29:38,707 --> 01:29:42,382
A bit of pocket money'?

977
01:29:44,679 --> 01:29:48,024
Give me some pocket money.

978
01:29:49,684 --> 01:29:51,220
Let me see!

979
01:29:51,419 --> 01:29:54,059
You're so fucking crazy.

980
01:29:56,491 --> 01:29:57,834
Evening.

981
01:29:57,893 --> 01:30:02,239
Sister, where you go? I don't know
where I'm going, what I'm doing!

982
01:30:04,733 --> 01:30:06,872
We go partying'?

983
01:30:12,574 --> 01:30:15,453
Get going!

984
01:30:20,382 --> 01:30:23,090
Six Euros!

985
01:30:23,518 --> 01:30:27,933
It's us again!
Here's one hundred. And two hundred.

986
01:30:28,123 --> 01:30:32,936
Good evening!
Remember? You wouldn't let us in!

987
01:30:35,397 --> 01:30:39,277
Here you are.
Take ii, take it, take it, brother.

988
01:30:43,571 --> 01:30:47,246
Give me a whisky, dude!
Just give me whisky, please.

989
01:30:47,709 --> 01:30:50,952
Give me everything you've got.
Give me two whiskies.

990
01:35:02,230 --> 01:35:08,203
I told you, the club belongs to me!

991
01:35:30,058 --> 01:35:31,867
It's over now.

992
01:35:31,926 --> 01:35:33,496
What do you mean, it's over'?

993
01:35:33,595 --> 01:35:38,669
Of course it's over.
That's why we're partying.

994
01:35:38,733 --> 01:35:41,339
Sorry, it happens sometimes.

995
01:35:41,569 --> 01:35:43,048
Our day is over!

996
01:35:43,104 --> 01:35:45,516
Yeah! These guys? These guys? Fire!
These guys'? Fire!

997
01:35:45,573 --> 01:35:48,179
Come on, get on with it!
This isn't your kind of place.

998
01:35:48,276 --> 01:35:51,052
What's up with you?
Come on! Off you go!

999
01:35:53,248 --> 01:35:56,127
We're dressed and ready to go!

1000
01:35:56,351 --> 01:35:58,957
Dressed and ready to go!

1001
01:35:59,454 --> 01:36:02,094
Let's go!

1002
01:36:08,963 --> 01:36:10,271
Get out!

1003
01:36:12,734 --> 01:36:14,771
Let her down, man.

1004
01:36:16,971 --> 01:36:20,111
I don't want to go!
I don't want to go.

1005
01:36:20,875 --> 01:36:23,981
The place is ours!
We go, we go, we go!

1006
01:36:40,328 --> 01:36:42,740
Boxer. I'm looking at your ass!

1007
01:36:42,997 --> 01:36:45,603
Hey, man, don't push it!

1008
01:36:52,940 --> 01:36:55,113
Don't touch my hair, please!

1009
01:36:56,511 --> 01:36:58,957
What are you doing?
You want to fight me?

1010
01:36:59,113 --> 01:37:01,821
You want to fight with me'?
I can kick your ass, OK?

1011
01:37:01,949 --> 01:37:03,690
Hang on a second.

1012
01:37:03,818 --> 01:37:05,820
Did you see that?
Give me a kiss.

1013
01:37:19,867 --> 01:37:23,474
We go party! We go party!

1014
01:37:23,938 --> 01:37:26,384
We go party! We go to the roof!

1015
01:37:26,507 --> 01:37:27,952
Blinker, brother!

1016
01:37:28,009 --> 01:37:32,048
Let's check what Fuss is doing,
you stupid morons!

1017
01:37:32,347 --> 01:37:35,817
Oh, my God! Fuss!
He's still in the car!

1018
01:37:40,888 --> 01:37:44,028
I totally forgot about him!

1019
01:37:44,125 --> 01:37:46,799
I completely forgot him!

1020
01:37:49,230 --> 01:37:52,234
Hey, Blinker, you retard!

1021
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:54,507
Man! Blinker! Man!

1022
01:38:12,387 --> 01:38:14,424
- Just run slowly!
- OK, OK, OK.

1023
01:38:14,589 --> 01:38:18,401
Fuck your shoes.
Don't panic. Act Normal!

1024
01:38:34,509 --> 01:38:36,284
Blinker, hey!

1025
01:38:36,444 --> 01:38:37,548
Blinker! Come on!

1026
01:38:37,678 --> 01:38:39,680
I'm coming. I'm coming.

1027
01:38:39,847 --> 01:38:42,418
Stay calm! Stay calm!

1028
01:38:47,388 --> 01:38:48,230
We'll make it!

1029
01:38:48,289 --> 01:38:50,394
Pull your fucking trousers up, man!

1030
01:38:51,859 --> 01:38:53,930
Where did they come from'?

1031
01:38:58,199 --> 01:39:02,147
What do we have to do now'?
Just go.

1032
01:39:02,970 --> 01:39:04,745
We fucked up! Really fucked up!

1033
01:39:04,872 --> 01:39:06,613
- We go to the roof now'?
- Yeah.

1034
01:39:28,963 --> 01:39:32,410
Cops.
I swear on my mother's grave!

1035
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,947
- Cops!
- Wait! Stop shouting!

1036
01:39:39,106 --> 01:39:42,144
What? What? What'?

1037
01:39:42,643 --> 01:39:44,520
Wait! Shit!

1038
01:39:46,013 --> 01:39:47,287
Wait!

1039
01:39:48,583 --> 01:39:51,427
Go! Go, man!
Move your fucking ass!

1040
01:39:58,125 --> 01:40:00,002
Don't run!

1041
01:40:13,040 --> 01:40:14,348
Go! Run! Run!

1042
01:40:16,844 --> 01:40:17,982
Go left!

1043
01:40:18,946 --> 01:40:20,050
Left, man!

1044
01:40:23,184 --> 01:40:23,958
Fuck you!

1045
01:40:24,018 --> 01:40:27,056
Police! Freeze! Stop!
Throw your guns down!

1046
01:40:27,188 --> 01:40:28,223
Fuck off!

1047
01:40:30,491 --> 01:40:32,562
Stay where you are!

1048
01:40:33,327 --> 01:40:36,069
Drop your weapons!

1049
01:40:38,165 --> 01:40:41,305
Stay where you are!
Drop the gun!

1050
01:40:41,669 --> 01:40:42,374
Freeze!

1051
01:40:42,503 --> 01:40:43,243
Blinker!

Sonne!

1053
01:40:46,340 --> 01:40:48,013
Fuck you, you wanker!

1054
01:40:48,075 --> 01:40:50,817
Put your weapons down
and come out now!

1055
01:40:52,013 --> 01:40:53,822
You bastards!

1056

Sonne!

1057
01:41:00,688 --> 01:41:03,567
Coma out!
You don't stand a chance.

1058
01:41:03,658 --> 01:41:05,729
Come out with your hands up!

1059
01:41:08,563 --> 01:41:09,735
Stop!

1060
01:41:09,830 --> 01:41:11,275
Stay where you are!

1061
01:41:12,400 --> 01:41:13,743
Leave the money!

1062
01:41:13,935 --> 01:41:16,074
- Come on!
- Drop the gun!

1063
01:41:16,871 --> 01:41:19,112
Drop the gun, or I'll shoot!

1064
01:41:23,744 --> 01:41:25,917
Boxer, come here!

1065
01:41:26,881 --> 01:41:28,224
Come on!

1066
01:41:35,289 --> 01:41:36,097
Where? Where'?

1067
01:41:36,190 --> 01:41:37,533
There's no way out!

1068
01:41:37,959 --> 01:41:39,700
Where, man? Where'?

1069
01:41:42,530 --> 01:41:43,474
Sonne!

1070
01:41:45,566 --> 01:41:46,601
Help me!

1071
01:41:47,401 --> 01:41:48,607
Fuck off!

1072
01:41:49,203 --> 01:41:51,376
Fuck off!

1073
01:41:52,239 --> 01:41:54,480
Throw your guns away!

1074
01:41:58,913 --> 01:42:02,383
Put down your guns!
Come out with your hands up!

1075
01:42:03,117 --> 01:42:05,620
Take the money!
You're coming with us!

1076
01:42:05,820 --> 01:42:09,324
You're coming with us!
You're coming with us!

1077
01:42:09,557 --> 01:42:11,594
Just get the fuck out of here!

1078
01:42:18,065 --> 01:42:19,135
Go! Go!

1079

Go! Go, go, go. Go. go!

1080
01:42:25,840 --> 01:42:27,478
Come. Come. Go. Go.

01:42:46,027 --> 01:42:48,439
They're cops! They're cops.

1082
01:42:49,930 --> 01:42:51,671
Upstairs. Upstairs.

1083
01:42:52,700 --> 01:42:54,179
Here are the cops.

1084
01:42:54,835 --> 01:42:56,473
Come here. Come. Come, come, come.

1085
01:43:03,377 --> 01:43:05,288
Don't look at me. Turn around.

1086
01:43:05,379 --> 01:43:07,188
Where do you live?
Upstairs. Upstairs!

1087
01:43:07,314 --> 01:43:10,318
Where do you live!
Upstairs, one floor up!

1088
01:43:10,384 --> 01:43:12,125
Let us in!

1089
01:43:12,386 --> 01:43:15,492
Move your ass! Go, go, go!
OK, OK!

Hurry UP!

01:43:20,327 --> 01:43:23,831
On the floor!
Shut the fuck up! In the living room!

1092
01:43:26,834 --> 01:43:28,177
You too!

1093
01:43:31,305 --> 01:43:33,911
Shut the fuck up!
Stay on the ground!

1094
01:43:34,809 --> 01:43:36,811
Stay on the ground!
Don't look at me!

1095
01:43:36,877 --> 01:43:39,323
Don't look at me! OK?

1096
01:43:39,413 --> 01:43:42,690
Shut the fuck up! Shut...

1097
01:43:55,896 --> 01:43:59,400
Why'd you let me
into your shitty ﬂat with a baby. Man'?

1098
01:43:59,500 --> 01:44:00,945
I don't know...

1099
01:44:01,035 --> 01:44:06,007
Are you stupid? You can't Let
me in when there's a baby here!

1100
01:44:11,846 --> 01:44:14,258
How stupid are you'?

1101
01:44:15,449 --> 01:44:16,951
How stupid are you, man?

1102
01:44:21,222 --> 01:44:22,860
Shut the fuck up.

1103
01:44:24,959 --> 01:44:27,462
Shut the fuck up.

1104
01:44:42,409 --> 01:44:43,888
It's over.

1105
01:44:46,814 --> 01:44:48,122
It's over.

1106
01:44:54,588 --> 01:44:58,434
So stupid. It was stupid.

1107
01:45:00,661 --> 01:45:04,404
Shut the fuck up!
Sonne, shut the fuck up.

1108
01:45:14,074 --> 01:45:16,611
Well, we're finished.

1109
01:45:19,580 --> 01:45:23,926

01:46:53,073 --> 01:46:57,613
Put your clothes on! Put Your clothes on!

1130
01:47:04,251 --> 01:47:07,061
OK. Listen to me. OK?

1131
01:47:07,621 --> 01:47:10,033
Your baby's going to be...
Hey, hey. Listen.

1132
01:47:10,758 --> 01:47:13,796
Your baby's going to be OK. I promise.

1133
01:47:13,928 --> 01:47:16,408
We need your help.
We just need to go out.

1134
01:47:16,530 --> 01:47:20,603
Your baby's going to be in that store
in five minutes.

1135
01:47:20,734 --> 01:47:24,978
I promise. I promise to you.
We need just your help. Please.

1136

01:48:01,241 --> 01:48:02,948
Where's the money'?

01:48:06,814 --> 01:48:08,157
Everything's OK.

1144
01:48:08,248 --> 01:48:09,921
It's going to be OK.

1145

Hey, it's OK.

Go.

1152
01:48:57,231 --> 01:48:58,141
Police!

Stay where you are! Hands up.

1154
01:49:01,869 --> 01:49:03,746
Take a step down.

1155
01:49:04,838 --> 01:49:06,545
Stop, stop.

1156
01:49:06,740 --> 01:49:11,519
Sparrowhawk to HQ?
I've got two individuals in the hall.

1157
01:49:12,646 --> 01:49:14,592
Two youths...

1158
01:49:15,082 --> 01:49:19,758
No. HQ, I need a
situation report now!

1159
01:49:21,422 --> 01:49:25,666
I've gut two individuals, mid twenties.
We live here.

1160
01:49:25,859 --> 01:49:29,033
They have a baby. We live here.

1161
01:49:30,497 --> 01:49:32,534
Give me a description!

1162
01:49:32,933 --> 01:49:36,574
They've got colourful clothing and a baby.

1163
01:49:37,504 --> 01:49:41,179
Come down here, please.
We live here.

1164
01:49:41,508 --> 01:49:45,217
What happened? What happened?

01:49:48,849 --> 01:49:50,886
Secure upstairs. What happened?

1166
01:49:50,951 --> 01:49:53,795
Stay here. You'll be picked up.

1167
01:49:53,887 --> 01:49:57,425
My colleagues will pick you up.
Just stay here.

1168
01:50:20,047 --> 01:50:24,086
We have to go here.
There's policemen everywhere. Yeah.

1169
01:50:24,218 --> 01:50:27,427
Yeah, but come, come.

1170
01:50:33,560 --> 01:50:35,631
They told us to get out fast!

1171
01:50:35,829 --> 01:50:37,570
Move around the comer.

1172
01:50:37,664 --> 01:50:38,938
Yes.

1173
01:50:38,999 --> 01:50:41,172
Take it. Take ii. Take it.

1174
01:50:52,746 --> 01:50:55,317
Where's the... Where's the gun'?

1175
01:51:00,587 --> 01:51:01,588
Shit!

01:51:33,353 --> 01:51:35,196
- Morning.
- Good morning.

1177
01:51:35,722 --> 01:51:37,292
Good morning.

1178
01:51:37,791 --> 01:51:39,361
- Greetings, sir.
- Hello!

1179
01:51:39,459 --> 01:51:42,997
- Straight on for now.
- OK.

1180
01:51:44,665 --> 01:51:47,145
Just straight on...

1181
01:51:47,367 --> 01:51:50,473
and then left...

1182
01:51:57,544 --> 01:52:00,923
Your first fare'? No, my last.

1183
01:52:01,014 --> 01:52:02,584
- Yeah?
- Left here'?

1184
01:52:02,716 --> 01:52:04,923
Yes, just go left.

1185
01:52:05,686 --> 01:52:07,825
You got it.

1186
01:52:23,937 --> 01:52:26,747
Can you just take us...'?

1187
01:52:27,941 --> 01:52:30,854
Just take us to a hotel.

1188
01:52:31,111 --> 01:52:35,287
What kind? Fifty or five hundred Euro'?
Doesn't matter.

1189
01:52:35,382 --> 01:52:37,589
- Round here'?
- Yeah.

1190
01:52:37,684 --> 01:52:38,856
OK.

1191
01:52:40,887 --> 01:52:43,390
Then let's try the Westin.

1192
01:52:44,291 --> 01:52:46,601
It's just round the corner.

1193
01:52:47,561 --> 01:52:49,472
Sweet.

1194
01:53:24,798 --> 01:53:27,005
- Are you OK'?
- Good.

1195
01:53:28,302 --> 01:53:31,840
- I'm OK. Are you OK'?
- Yeah.

1196
01:53:36,076 --> 01:53:38,784
Give me the money.

1197
01:54:02,536 --> 01:54:05,517
I'll give you a hundred.

1198
01:54:05,772 --> 01:54:08,150
I can't change that.

1199
01:54:08,275 --> 01:54:11,654
Ah, no problem!

1200
01:54:11,778 --> 01:54:15,521
Why, thank you!
We just came from the slot machines.

1201
01:54:17,718 --> 01:54:19,629
Very generous!

1202
01:54:25,058 --> 01:54:29,336
- So, here we are.
- Perfect.

1203
01:54:30,897 --> 01:54:34,640
OK. Thank you. Have a nice day.

1204
01:54:35,001 --> 01:54:36,674
- Yes.
- Bye.

1205
01:54:36,837 --> 01:54:38,077
Bye.

1206
01:54:38,472 --> 01:54:41,578
We're going into a hotel'?
We go in...

1207
01:54:43,310 --> 01:54:45,916
Come, let's go.

1208
01:54:48,014 --> 01:54:50,824
Let's relax a little bit.

1209
01:54:57,657 --> 01:54:59,068
- Bye.
- Bye.

1210
01:55:14,274 --> 01:55:18,051
Do you have a passport?
Passport'? No.

1211
01:55:18,278 --> 01:55:22,351
We need a passport.
We need a passport to check in.

1212
01:55:23,450 --> 01:55:26,397
That's a problem.
No. No. Don't Worry.

1213
01:55:26,520 --> 01:55:29,467
You give me the money
and I organize a room.

1214
01:55:29,689 --> 01:55:31,134
Yeah. Come.

1215
01:55:46,139 --> 01:55:49,313
- I'll come in a minute.
- Yeah.

1216
01:57:50,564 --> 01:57:52,271
Give me the money.

1217
01:57:52,432 --> 01:57:56,881
I'm going to tell them a story
and organize a room.

1218
01:57:57,037 --> 01:57:58,846
Good.

1219
01:58:56,663 --> 01:58:58,665
Hey. Let's go. - Now? - Yeah.

1220
01:58:58,898 --> 01:59:00,809
I have a room.

1221
01:59:01,468 --> 01:59:03,448
- Are you OK'?
- Yeah.

1222
01:59:03,570 --> 01:59:05,140
Yeah? OK.

1223
01:59:07,674 --> 01:59:09,449
- Wail.
- Yeah.

1224
01:59:13,813 --> 01:59:15,156
It's this way.

1225
01:59:18,618 --> 01:59:21,428
Hey. How are you'? Are you OK'?
Yeah.

1226
01:59:21,655 --> 01:59:23,601
- Sure?
- Yeah!

1227
01:59:33,133 --> 01:59:35,773
- Sonne, are you OK'?
- Yeah.

1228
01:59:37,704 --> 01:59:41,174
Are you bleeding? Fuck!
Are you bleeding?

1229
01:59:41,541 --> 01:59:45,182
Nothing. Nu, no.
Show me. Show me.

1230
01:59:45,445 --> 01:59:48,187
I just have to lay down.

1231
01:59:54,654 --> 01:59:57,965
Are you OK'?

1232
01:59:59,793 --> 02:00:03,502
Are you OK or not'?
Tell me the truth.

1233
02:00:03,630 --> 02:00:05,507
Go. Go.

1234
02:00:05,899 --> 02:00:08,743
- Go! Go, go!
- Wail!

1235
02:00:09,569 --> 02:00:10,912
Come on!

1236
02:00:15,742 --> 02:00:18,313
It's there. OK'?

1237
02:00:19,179 --> 02:00:22,558
Can you walk'?
Hey? I'm good now.

1238
02:00:23,316 --> 02:00:25,887
I'm good. - Sure? - Yeah.

1239
02:00:28,922 --> 02:00:30,902
It's cold.

1240
02:00:32,325 --> 02:00:33,326
OK. Come.

1241
02:00:37,931 --> 02:00:39,842
OK. Let's go.

1242
02:01:02,455 --> 02:01:03,559
Wait.

1243
02:01:12,565 --> 02:01:16,479
Come. Come.
Come on. Sonne, let's go.

1244
02:01:16,870 --> 02:01:18,907
- I just lay down.
- Yes.

1245
02:01:19,072 --> 02:01:21,746
The bed, it's there. Go.

1246
02:01:27,914 --> 02:01:30,394
In the bed! There! Go!

1247
02:01:33,787 --> 02:01:36,063
Wait.

1248
02:01:39,225 --> 02:01:41,501
Come. Come.

1249
02:01:43,129 --> 02:01:44,267
Sonne!

1250
02:01:47,100 --> 02:01:49,979
It's cold. Cold.
Wait. Wait. Wait.

1251
02:01:50,770 --> 02:01:51,976
Cold.

1252
02:01:54,307 --> 02:01:56,617
Show me that Really.

1253
02:01:59,112 --> 02:02:00,785
You have to go to the hospital.

1254
02:02:22,468 --> 02:02:24,277
I'm going to bring you water.

1255
02:02:37,150 --> 02:02:43,795
The police identified the getaway car,
