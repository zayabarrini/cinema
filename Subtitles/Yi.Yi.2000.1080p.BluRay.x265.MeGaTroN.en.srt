1
00:01:17,376 --> 00:01:20,140
Dear sister and brother-in-law,
thank you.

2
00:01:20,179 --> 00:01:23,114
From here on in, it's your show.

3
00:01:23,148 --> 00:01:25,878
Isn't it our turn for photos?

4
00:01:25,918 --> 00:01:28,318
Where are the kids?

5
00:01:39,164 --> 00:01:40,791
Grandma...

6
00:01:40,833 --> 00:01:42,232
Iook.

7
00:01:46,271 --> 00:01:48,330
It was on the tree.

8
00:01:51,643 --> 00:01:54,908
Anything wrong?

9
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:26,010
You know that strange woman?

10
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,344
Can I help you, Miss?

11
00:02:30,382 --> 00:02:32,680
-Looking for someone.
-May I ask who?

12
00:02:32,718 --> 00:02:34,379
Mind your own business!

13
00:02:36,522 --> 00:02:38,217
Yun-Yun!

14
00:02:38,257 --> 00:02:40,054
Ting-Ting...

15
00:02:40,092 --> 00:02:43,459
you look so pretty today!

16
00:02:43,495 --> 00:02:46,794
Where's your grandma?

17
00:02:54,873 --> 00:02:59,674
I'm so sorry!

18
00:02:59,711 --> 00:03:05,149
It should have been me
marrying your son today!

19
00:03:05,183 --> 00:03:08,448
I let you down, I'm so sorry.

20
00:03:08,487 --> 00:03:12,480
It breaks my heart,
I'm not worthy of you!

21
00:03:12,524 --> 00:03:16,051
-Don't push me around!
-It's not that bad!

22
00:03:17,963 --> 00:03:20,830
Where is she?

23
00:03:20,866 --> 00:03:24,267
Where is that pregnant bitch?

24
00:03:25,337 --> 00:03:26,531
Dad...

25
00:03:26,572 --> 00:03:28,972
Grandma wants to go home.

26
00:03:29,007 --> 00:03:30,338
Go home?

27
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:33,942
She doesn't feel well.

28
00:03:36,415 --> 00:03:38,406
And tonight?

29
00:03:42,854 --> 00:03:45,049
Where's Xiao Yan?

30
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:48,082
Show your face, Xiao Yan!

31
00:03:50,295 --> 00:03:53,128
Give A-Di back to me!

32
00:03:53,165 --> 00:03:57,431
You'll face retribution
for this!

33
00:05:07,506 --> 00:05:09,804
Sorry about the mess.

34
00:05:09,841 --> 00:05:11,741
We're the Jiangs...I'm Lili.

35
00:05:11,777 --> 00:05:13,540
I'm Ting-Ting.

36
00:05:13,578 --> 00:05:15,842
This is my grandma.

37
00:05:15,881 --> 00:05:17,109
We're the Jians.

38
00:05:17,149 --> 00:05:18,980
See you later, bye!

39
00:05:58,056 --> 00:05:59,648
Ting-Ting!

40
00:05:59,691 --> 00:06:03,627
Take out the garbage
before we go.

41
00:06:03,662 --> 00:06:05,289
I'm doing it.

42
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:07,093
It's starting to smell.

43
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,534
There's some on the balcony.

44
00:06:10,569 --> 00:06:12,059
I know.

45
00:06:20,645 --> 00:06:23,375
What was I getting?

46
00:06:34,626 --> 00:06:36,685
How did you find me?

47
00:06:36,728 --> 00:06:38,389
Followed the removal men.

48
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:40,421
Mother will be livid!

49
00:06:40,465 --> 00:06:41,864
I miss you!

50
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,334
Don't I call you?

51
00:06:44,369 --> 00:06:46,701
Can't see you on the phone.

52
00:06:46,738 --> 00:06:48,535
Come.

53
00:07:10,896 --> 00:07:14,388
Sorry, I'm in the middle
of moving house.

54
00:07:14,432 --> 00:07:17,799
It's a huge mess!

55
00:07:17,836 --> 00:07:20,703
Call me on this mobile number.

56
00:07:20,739 --> 00:07:23,401
I'll have a phone line
in tomorrow.

57
00:07:24,509 --> 00:07:28,969
No problem.

58
00:07:43,628 --> 00:07:45,892
Ready, Ting-Ting?

59
00:07:56,441 --> 00:07:58,739
What's on your mind?

60
00:07:58,777 --> 00:08:01,575
I feel sorry for Yun-Yun.

61
00:08:04,382 --> 00:08:09,479
If it's not Uncle's fault,
it must be Xiao Yan's.

62
00:08:09,521 --> 00:08:14,117
Don't say that.
We hardly know her.

63
00:08:14,159 --> 00:08:18,027
I think Grandma's right.
We can't accept her.

64
00:08:18,063 --> 00:08:19,963
Did Grandma say that?

65
00:08:19,998 --> 00:08:23,866
No...
but she's been unhappy all day.

66
00:08:23,902 --> 00:08:26,063
Did she say anything else?

67
00:08:26,104 --> 00:08:29,403
No, but she said
she feels really old.

68
00:08:29,441 --> 00:08:31,773
What does she mean by that?

69
00:08:37,082 --> 00:08:40,779
The groom is right behind me!

70
00:08:40,819 --> 00:08:44,118
Put your hands together!

71
00:08:47,626 --> 00:08:50,652
Your wife's brother is some guy!

72
00:08:50,695 --> 00:08:53,994
Not many weddings
with the bride so very pregnant!

73
00:08:54,032 --> 00:08:55,829
That's the way he is!

74
00:08:55,867 --> 00:08:58,392
He put off the wedding
for months...

75
00:08:58,436 --> 00:09:02,634
because this is the luckiest day
of the year in the almanac.

76
00:09:04,976 --> 00:09:07,035
Take his shoe!

77
00:09:10,682 --> 00:09:13,412
Don't mess with girls!

78
00:09:18,223 --> 00:09:22,182
Pregnant brides
aren't unusual these days.

79
00:09:22,227 --> 00:09:24,218
We had
"bus rides without tickets"...

80
00:09:24,262 --> 00:09:26,924
in our day, too, you know.

81
00:09:26,965 --> 00:09:29,900
Sorry, Yang-Yang,
this is your seat.

82
00:09:29,935 --> 00:09:32,563
Girls teased him again.

83
00:09:32,604 --> 00:09:35,334
Never mind, have some food.

84
00:09:35,373 --> 00:09:37,568
So, did you and NJ?

85
00:09:37,609 --> 00:09:39,600
Guess.

86
00:09:39,644 --> 00:09:41,703
No, thanks!

87
00:09:41,746 --> 00:09:44,374
You women always
trap men that way.

88
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:46,884
It still works.

89
00:09:46,918 --> 00:09:49,079
It worked on your brother.

90
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,681
NJ would be a pushover.

91
00:09:52,724 --> 00:09:53,952
So?

92
00:09:53,992 --> 00:09:55,391
Here's the bus-rider!

93
00:09:55,427 --> 00:09:58,919
What? I drove myself here.

94
00:09:58,964 --> 00:10:03,128
Drink!
It's on my brother-in-law.

95
00:10:03,168 --> 00:10:06,137
Why aren't you eating?

96
00:10:06,171 --> 00:10:09,538
Those girls teased him again.

97
00:10:09,574 --> 00:10:12,134
Try this new toy!

98
00:10:12,177 --> 00:10:14,407
Just let him be.

99
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,728
Is it really you?

100
00:11:07,665 --> 00:11:10,099
You're still in Taipei?

101
00:11:15,006 --> 00:11:18,134
I live...in the U.S. now.

102
00:11:22,247 --> 00:11:25,045
Your son?

103
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:27,415
So cute.

104
00:11:37,962 --> 00:11:40,658
This is my number.

105
00:11:40,698 --> 00:11:43,030
Call me.

106
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:21,534
Why didn't you come that day?

107
00:12:21,573 --> 00:12:23,973
I waited and waited...

108
00:12:24,008 --> 00:12:26,772
I've never got over it,
you know.

109
00:12:31,449 --> 00:12:34,213
Sherry!

110
00:12:34,252 --> 00:12:36,243
How many years has it been?

111
00:12:36,287 --> 00:12:38,255
Almost thirty!

112
00:12:38,289 --> 00:12:40,519
Not that long!

113
00:12:40,558 --> 00:12:43,686
It hasn't been that long
since we graduated.

114
00:12:43,728 --> 00:12:46,720
Didn't know you two
were still in touch.

115
00:12:46,764 --> 00:12:49,324
We just ran into
each other by chance.

116
00:12:49,367 --> 00:12:53,326
Good to see you still get along!

117
00:12:56,307 --> 00:12:58,434
My namecard.

118
00:12:58,476 --> 00:13:00,341
My husband does business
in China...

119
00:13:00,378 --> 00:13:02,642
so I'll be in town quite a bit.

120
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:06,116
-Stay in touch, OK?
-I sure will.

121
00:13:06,151 --> 00:13:07,982
Sorry, I've run out of
namecards.

122
00:13:08,019 --> 00:13:10,579
I keep forgetting to...

123
00:13:11,623 --> 00:13:13,887
Sorry, I must go.

124
00:13:13,925 --> 00:13:15,893
-Remember, stay in touch!
-Promise!

125
00:13:20,832 --> 00:13:23,062
It really is a lucky day.

126
00:13:23,101 --> 00:13:25,331
I've forgotten
my own first love.

127
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:28,203
Why do I remember yours?

128
00:13:31,809 --> 00:13:34,676
What did I come down for?

129
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:40,674
Some tea?

130
00:13:40,718 --> 00:13:42,743
No, thanks.

131
00:13:44,189 --> 00:13:47,352
-Something wrong?
-Nothing.

132
00:13:51,996 --> 00:13:53,896
Dad, your cigar burst it!

133
00:13:53,932 --> 00:13:57,265
See what happens when you smoke
those disgusting things?

134
00:13:57,302 --> 00:13:58,667
It wasn't...

135
00:13:58,703 --> 00:14:01,399
Then who was it?

136
00:14:01,439 --> 00:14:04,340
Er...Whatever.

137
00:14:21,226 --> 00:14:24,161
Quiet! Shut it!

138
00:14:24,195 --> 00:14:26,459
Now the elders are involved.

139
00:14:26,497 --> 00:14:29,193
Fair enough.
They must both drink.

140
00:14:29,234 --> 00:14:31,634
One each!

141
00:14:46,017 --> 00:14:48,315
What the fuck is this?

142
00:14:48,353 --> 00:14:52,187
It's called a "depth charge."

143
00:14:52,223 --> 00:14:57,525
You'll both have
pot bellies after this!

144
00:14:57,562 --> 00:14:59,120
Beer!

145
00:14:59,163 --> 00:15:01,154
Plus fruit juice!

146
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,167
Chewed betel nuts!

147
00:15:03,201 --> 00:15:06,398
Eggs and salt!

148
00:15:06,437 --> 00:15:09,531
Drink up!

149
00:15:20,418 --> 00:15:22,477
Applause!

150
00:15:34,766 --> 00:15:37,462
Is it raining?

151
00:16:04,162 --> 00:16:07,928
Can you manage
the stuff in the trunk?

152
00:16:07,965 --> 00:16:11,799
If not, ask Dad to bring it in
when he's parked.

153
00:16:14,839 --> 00:16:17,239
Don't forget the big bag.

154
00:16:19,977 --> 00:16:23,071
Mrs. Jian! Why are you so late?

155
00:16:23,114 --> 00:16:27,210
Get to the hospital!
Your mother's been rushed there!

156
00:16:27,251 --> 00:16:28,843
My mother?

157
00:16:28,886 --> 00:16:31,081
Wait!

158
00:16:38,396 --> 00:16:41,456
I'll go in to see her first, NJ.

159
00:16:41,499 --> 00:16:44,991
Wait here for A-Di.
He'll be here soon.

160
00:16:45,036 --> 00:16:47,266
Tell Ting-Ting
to put Yang-Yang to bed.

161
00:16:47,305 --> 00:16:50,331
I did. You go ahead!

162
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:52,138
What does the doctor say?

163
00:16:52,176 --> 00:16:55,509
She's had a stroke.
They need to operate.

164
00:16:55,546 --> 00:17:00,916
I saw her lying in the driveway
by the dustbins.

165
00:17:00,952 --> 00:17:03,978
Did she fall over?
Was she hit by a car?

166
00:17:04,021 --> 00:17:07,457
Why was she downstairs?

167
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,723
You drove here drunk?

168
00:17:10,762 --> 00:17:12,696
The cops drink, too!

169
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:14,857
Don't worry, NJ.

170
00:17:14,899 --> 00:17:17,925
Sister called
and told me what happened.

171
00:17:17,969 --> 00:17:21,928
Mother will be fine. It's
the luckiest day of the year!

172
00:17:21,973 --> 00:17:24,942
-She'll wake up in no time.
-A-Di, it's not that simple.

173
00:17:24,976 --> 00:17:27,035
Maybe you don't trust me.

174
00:17:27,078 --> 00:17:29,945
Things are different now!

175
00:17:29,981 --> 00:17:33,382
I was unlucky, so I borrowed
from you and sister.

176
00:17:33,418 --> 00:17:37,218
Now my luck has turned!
I'll be repaying you soon!

177
00:17:37,255 --> 00:17:39,155
-There's no rush.
-Trust me!

178
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:42,057
You saw my partner
Piggy tonight.

179
00:17:42,093 --> 00:17:45,654
He'll pay me back tomorrow,
and I'll pay you back next day!

180
00:18:06,517 --> 00:18:09,714
Ting-Ting took out the garbage
in the afternoon.

181
00:18:09,754 --> 00:18:12,689
What was Mother doing
down by the dustbins?

182
00:18:12,723 --> 00:18:17,387
We don't know if she fell
or was knocked over by a car.

183
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:33,006
My brother says
she'll recover quickly.

184
00:18:33,044 --> 00:18:35,877
It was the luckiest day
of the year.

185
00:18:35,913 --> 00:18:38,507
He put off his wedding
for this lucky day.

186
00:18:38,549 --> 00:18:41,143
Nothing unlucky can happen.

187
00:18:41,185 --> 00:18:44,086
Otherwise,
Mother would be dead by now.

188
00:18:44,121 --> 00:18:46,646
That's one way to see it.

189
00:18:46,691 --> 00:18:48,852
How else?

190
00:18:48,893 --> 00:18:50,588
Don't complicate things!

191
00:18:50,628 --> 00:18:52,027
How's this, Min-Min?

192
00:18:52,063 --> 00:18:55,590
Didn't I say
it goes to City Hall?

193
00:18:57,602 --> 00:19:00,901
How does your Master see it?

194
00:19:02,273 --> 00:19:05,401
You should ask him yourself,
I think.

195
00:19:05,443 --> 00:19:08,708
I spent two weeks
at the temple with you.

196
00:19:08,746 --> 00:19:11,078
But I didn't understand
his teachings.

197
00:19:11,115 --> 00:19:14,915
I don't think the Master
would take me as his disciple.

198
00:19:14,952 --> 00:19:17,512
Two weeks may not be enough.

199
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:23,358
Look how busy I am.

200
00:19:23,394 --> 00:19:25,726
How can I find the time?

201
00:19:25,763 --> 00:19:29,392
Maybe you need
a bit more humility.

202
00:19:31,469 --> 00:19:35,496
Are you saying
there's something wrong with me?

203
00:19:36,874 --> 00:19:39,206
Look at Yang-Yang!

204
00:19:42,947 --> 00:19:45,507
My auntie was like this
at her wedding.

205
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:46,915
So fat?

206
00:19:46,951 --> 00:19:49,215
No. Guess why.

207
00:19:49,253 --> 00:19:51,244
What's under your shirt?

208
00:19:51,289 --> 00:19:53,189
A balloon!

209
00:19:53,224 --> 00:19:56,022
One inside the other!

210
00:19:57,895 --> 00:20:00,455
She's coming!

211
00:20:00,498 --> 00:20:02,261
Concubine! Concubine!

212
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,824
Is she the Concubine?

213
00:20:03,868 --> 00:20:05,233
Shut up!

214
00:20:07,271 --> 00:20:08,898
Stay there!

215
00:20:10,608 --> 00:20:12,872
Get on with your work!

216
00:20:16,213 --> 00:20:18,238
What's that in your hand?

217
00:20:18,282 --> 00:20:21,251
Nothing.

218
00:20:21,285 --> 00:20:23,116
Better watch yourself!

219
00:20:24,155 --> 00:20:27,318
Yang-Yang, she likes you!

220
00:20:27,358 --> 00:20:29,622
Her old man will be jealous!

221
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,184
Who's her old man?

222
00:20:33,264 --> 00:20:35,664
Today...

223
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:38,601
one of you has brought
something bad to class.

224
00:20:38,636 --> 00:20:40,126
Who is it?

225
00:20:40,171 --> 00:20:42,162
Who has brought a condom?

226
00:20:42,206 --> 00:20:44,003
Stand up!

227
00:20:46,544 --> 00:20:51,982
If he won't admit it,
I'll name him.

228
00:20:53,384 --> 00:20:57,377
Jian Yang-Yang, it's you!
Stand up!

229
00:20:58,823 --> 00:21:00,882
Hand over your condom!

230
00:21:00,925 --> 00:21:02,916
What's a condom?

231
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,724
Playing dumb?

232
00:21:05,763 --> 00:21:08,254
Don't laugh! You're shameless!

233
00:21:10,701 --> 00:21:13,966
You can't hide it!
I know everything!

234
00:21:14,005 --> 00:21:16,667
Who's telling lies about me?

235
00:21:16,707 --> 00:21:18,675
Never you mind!

236
00:21:18,709 --> 00:21:23,476
You just heard something,
you didn't see it.

237
00:21:25,716 --> 00:21:29,311
So I'm wrong, am l?

238
00:21:29,353 --> 00:21:33,915
You think I need
to see it to know?

239
00:21:34,992 --> 00:21:37,961
I even know
which pocket it's in.

240
00:21:37,995 --> 00:21:41,123
Your left pocket. Come on!

241
00:21:45,002 --> 00:21:47,664
What's this?

242
00:21:47,705 --> 00:21:50,401
A balloon.

243
00:21:56,047 --> 00:21:58,106
Quiet!

244
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:05,512
I'll let it go this time...

245
00:22:05,556 --> 00:22:08,081
but you'd better watch out!

246
00:23:17,995 --> 00:23:20,088
Finish your milk!

247
00:23:20,131 --> 00:23:22,656
We both will be late.

248
00:23:28,906 --> 00:23:31,306
You'll never grow tall.

249
00:23:36,747 --> 00:23:38,840
Good morning, Mrs. Jiang.

250
00:23:40,785 --> 00:23:44,243
First Girls' High.
Great school!

251
00:23:44,288 --> 00:23:45,983
You are good.

252
00:23:46,023 --> 00:23:48,253
So is Lili!

253
00:23:48,292 --> 00:23:51,819
I hear her playing every day,
so beautiful.

254
00:23:51,862 --> 00:23:55,389
I hope it's not too loud.
Do you play an instrument?

255
00:23:55,432 --> 00:23:58,299
Yes, but I'm not very good.

256
00:23:58,335 --> 00:24:02,533
Better to be good at books,
anyway.

257
00:24:04,909 --> 00:24:06,308
What's the point?

258
00:24:06,343 --> 00:24:08,140
What's the point?

259
00:24:08,179 --> 00:24:10,374
Last year's profits are gone.

260
00:24:10,414 --> 00:24:12,507
Everyone does computers now.

261
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:15,075
Remember how
the garment business crashed?

262
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:19,249
The more orders you fill,
the more money you lose.

263
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:22,657
Instead of cashing in...

264
00:24:22,693 --> 00:24:27,426
you blew it all
on lavish expansion plans.

265
00:24:27,464 --> 00:24:29,125
So, what can I do?

266
00:24:29,166 --> 00:24:33,227
You screwed up real bad.
What can I do?

267
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:36,865
We do have a strategy,
one step at a time.

268
00:24:36,907 --> 00:24:40,468
There's always ups and downs
at a time of transition.

269
00:24:40,511 --> 00:24:42,240
I warn you...

270
00:24:42,279 --> 00:24:45,043
one more negative review...

271
00:24:45,082 --> 00:24:46,640
and we'll pull out.

272
00:24:46,684 --> 00:24:49,710
So, what's this strategy?

273
00:24:49,753 --> 00:24:51,880
Moving into software?

274
00:24:51,922 --> 00:24:53,355
Or into...content?

275
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:57,656
Damn right!
It's still hush-hush.

276
00:24:58,896 --> 00:25:01,729
Heard of a Japanese named Ota?

277
00:25:01,765 --> 00:25:03,824
Computer games?

278
00:25:03,868 --> 00:25:06,803
-That surprised you, right?
-Promising...

279
00:25:06,837 --> 00:25:09,032
Go on!

280
00:25:09,073 --> 00:25:13,567
We're always cutting-edge!

281
00:25:13,611 --> 00:25:15,579
Sure you are!

282
00:25:15,613 --> 00:25:18,707
But you're down the tube
if we pull out.

283
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:23,251
Why "cash in"
when we were ahead?

284
00:25:23,287 --> 00:25:26,916
"No prisoners" was our policy.
Remember?

285
00:25:26,957 --> 00:25:29,858
He better shut up!

286
00:25:29,894 --> 00:25:31,156
Why should he?

287
00:25:31,195 --> 00:25:35,063
You were too honest
and told him everything.

288
00:25:35,099 --> 00:25:36,396
I'm not like you.

289
00:25:36,433 --> 00:25:39,994
We don't even know this "Ota."

290
00:25:40,037 --> 00:25:42,403
And we're going bust!

291
00:25:42,439 --> 00:25:43,997
He doesn't come cheap.

292
00:25:44,041 --> 00:25:45,565
He's a brand name!

293
00:25:45,609 --> 00:25:49,170
We buy his name
to attract investors.

294
00:25:49,213 --> 00:25:52,910
Brand name? What if it
costs too much to recoup?

295
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:55,544
It's our neck. I'm against it.

296
00:25:55,586 --> 00:25:57,884
Taiwan has the best copycats.

297
00:25:57,922 --> 00:26:01,016
Are they ripping off
Ota's stuff?

298
00:26:01,058 --> 00:26:02,958
I'll check.

299
00:26:02,993 --> 00:26:07,259
What will you guys do
if we go bust?

300
00:26:07,298 --> 00:26:11,632
I know. You'll retire,
stay home, and smoke your pipe.

301
00:26:11,669 --> 00:26:15,571
Da-Da, you'll move
to San Francisco?

302
00:26:15,606 --> 00:26:17,267
And you, NJ?

303
00:26:17,308 --> 00:26:21,176
All your money's in the company,
isn't it?

304
00:26:22,212 --> 00:26:23,907
He didn't hear me.

305
00:26:23,948 --> 00:26:25,540
He doesn't want to answer.

306
00:26:25,582 --> 00:26:31,145
He has other things on his mind.

307
00:26:36,927 --> 00:26:39,589
I'm going. Uncle is here.

308
00:26:41,465 --> 00:26:43,729
Ting-Ting! You're leaving?

309
00:26:43,767 --> 00:26:46,634
Yes. You two enjoy yourselves.

310
00:26:52,276 --> 00:26:55,336
I didn't know
she was meeting you.

311
00:26:55,379 --> 00:26:58,348
She and I are still very close.

312
00:26:58,382 --> 00:27:01,943
Hey, everything's fine now.

313
00:27:01,986 --> 00:27:06,821
I even urged Ting-Ting
to be kind to your new wife.

314
00:27:08,993 --> 00:27:13,157
We didn't marry,
but we're still friends.

315
00:27:13,197 --> 00:27:15,597
All these years!

316
00:27:15,632 --> 00:27:18,328
Yes, many years.

317
00:27:20,371 --> 00:27:22,339
You're so calm. I'm surprised.

318
00:27:22,373 --> 00:27:24,739
Let's get to work.

319
00:27:26,076 --> 00:27:29,204
Everyone was stunned by what
you did at the wedding banquet.

320
00:27:29,246 --> 00:27:33,546
Don't get me going again, OK?

321
00:27:33,584 --> 00:27:35,449
Here, look.

322
00:27:35,486 --> 00:27:39,479
I've transferred part of
our savings to your account.

323
00:27:39,523 --> 00:27:43,186
We cleared twenty million
on Yahoo and AOL.

324
00:27:43,227 --> 00:27:46,162
Part of it is in a mutual fund.

325
00:27:46,196 --> 00:27:49,654
The documents here
need your authorization.

326
00:27:54,304 --> 00:27:58,434
And find me a boyfriend.

327
00:27:58,475 --> 00:28:01,342
I'm alone now. You know that.

328
00:28:04,181 --> 00:28:07,207
Figures give me a headache.

329
00:28:12,756 --> 00:28:14,189
Lili!

330
00:28:18,729 --> 00:28:22,358
I heard your grandma
is in the hospital.

331
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:23,525
Yes.

332
00:28:23,567 --> 00:28:25,467
Is it serious?

333
00:28:25,502 --> 00:28:29,768
She's in a coma. She fell.

334
00:28:29,807 --> 00:28:33,140
I love your grandma.
She's so elegant.

335
00:28:33,177 --> 00:28:35,509
She was a teacher.

336
00:28:35,546 --> 00:28:37,707
It's your boyfriend.

337
00:28:37,748 --> 00:28:39,943
Right.

338
00:28:39,983 --> 00:28:42,383
Why don't you go over?

339
00:28:57,434 --> 00:29:00,403
I'll see you later.

340
00:29:08,579 --> 00:29:14,017
You should move her
every hour or so.

341
00:29:14,051 --> 00:29:15,916
Like this.

342
00:29:15,953 --> 00:29:18,513
A different position every time.

343
00:29:18,555 --> 00:29:21,046
First one side, like this...

344
00:29:21,091 --> 00:29:24,254
then the other, like that.

345
00:29:24,294 --> 00:29:28,287
And put a pillow under her back.

346
00:29:28,332 --> 00:29:30,357
That's the way.

347
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:34,427
And pat her back often.

348
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:39,969
Do it yourself
if the nurse isn't here.

349
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:42,274
-That's for her circulation?
-Exactly.

350
00:29:43,947 --> 00:29:46,211
I think that's all.

351
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:48,115
Doctor...

352
00:29:48,152 --> 00:29:52,248
how long before Mother
regains consciousness?

353
00:29:52,289 --> 00:29:54,018
It's hard to say.

354
00:29:54,057 --> 00:29:58,084
Treat her normally.
Open her window in the daytime.

355
00:29:58,128 --> 00:30:01,996
Take her out in the wheelchair,
turn off the lights at night.

356
00:30:02,032 --> 00:30:06,662
Most important, talk to her.
It stimulates her senses.

357
00:30:07,671 --> 00:30:10,003
But I'm not optimistic.

358
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:13,532
You should prepare
for the worst.

359
00:31:58,582 --> 00:32:02,814
Sorry, brother-in-law,
I haven't repaid you yet.

360
00:32:02,853 --> 00:32:04,548
Never mind.

361
00:32:05,956 --> 00:32:08,584
If I forget again, remind me.

362
00:32:08,625 --> 00:32:11,526
I'm thinking about the company.

363
00:32:13,597 --> 00:32:15,588
Bad mood?

364
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:19,160
More financial problems?

365
00:32:19,202 --> 00:32:21,397
You're not going bust, are you?

366
00:32:21,438 --> 00:32:25,135
I'm thinking about the meeting
with the Japanese tomorrow.

367
00:32:25,175 --> 00:32:28,667
Fuck! Are you in debt to Japan?

368
00:32:28,712 --> 00:32:33,274
No! What are you saying?

369
00:32:33,317 --> 00:32:35,444
Of course not!

370
00:32:37,921 --> 00:32:39,752
Yang-Yang...

371
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:42,384
it's your turn.

372
00:32:42,426 --> 00:32:48,456
From now on, we'll take turns
to talk to Grandma.

373
00:32:48,498 --> 00:32:51,661
It will make her wake up sooner.

374
00:32:53,937 --> 00:32:56,701
Ting-Ting hasn't done it.

375
00:32:56,740 --> 00:33:01,234
She played the piano,
didn't she?

376
00:33:01,278 --> 00:33:06,807
I could show her my drawings,
but she can't see.

377
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:11,719
But she'll hear you.
Didn't the doctor say so?

378
00:33:11,755 --> 00:33:14,883
There's lots to tell her.

379
00:33:14,925 --> 00:33:17,052
Like what happened at school...

380
00:33:17,094 --> 00:33:19,028
or some little secret you have.

381
00:33:19,062 --> 00:33:21,895
You can tell Grandma anything.

382
00:33:24,935 --> 00:33:28,803
What's the matter?
Why that grumpy look?

383
00:33:29,873 --> 00:33:32,364
Don't want to talk to her?

384
00:33:38,382 --> 00:33:42,978
What's the point?
She can't see what I tell her.

385
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:45,749
What?

386
00:33:45,789 --> 00:33:50,624
Are you trying to get out of it?
That's not nice!

387
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:54,960
How can you let Grandma down?

388
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:59,028
You're making me cross!

389
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:02,903
Don't they teach you
anything at school?

390
00:34:02,939 --> 00:34:04,634
Grandma loves you so much.

391
00:34:05,842 --> 00:34:08,936
You can't just ignore her,
can you?

392
00:34:08,979 --> 00:34:10,879
You just can't!

393
00:34:12,115 --> 00:34:18,145
You take a break.
I'll talk to her first.

394
00:34:20,223 --> 00:34:24,922
It's my turn.

395
00:34:28,498 --> 00:34:33,128
Ma, I'm good at talking.

396
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:37,732
Luck's on my side now,
don't worry.

397
00:34:41,478 --> 00:34:43,571
I'm rich now.

398
00:34:43,613 --> 00:34:46,138
People come to me for loans!

399
00:34:46,183 --> 00:34:51,815
Not like the old days when
my borrowing made you worry.

400
00:34:54,124 --> 00:34:57,423
I've made lots of rich friends.

401
00:35:05,068 --> 00:35:06,558
And...

402
00:35:06,603 --> 00:35:10,767
Don't you worry about Xiao Yan.

403
00:35:10,807 --> 00:35:12,536
She's a nice girl.

404
00:35:12,576 --> 00:35:14,601
Really...

405
00:35:16,646 --> 00:35:20,446
And...what else...

406
00:35:21,985 --> 00:35:26,854
The other stuff...
I guess you know.

407
00:35:29,693 --> 00:35:32,753
If you have questions,
you can't ask...

408
00:35:36,299 --> 00:35:38,824
Today...

409
00:35:42,806 --> 00:35:45,138
Iet's call it...

410
00:35:48,445 --> 00:35:51,039
You must be tired...

411
00:35:51,081 --> 00:35:54,380
I'll try, and tomorrow...

412
00:35:57,487 --> 00:36:00,945
That's for...today...

413
00:37:08,158 --> 00:37:10,319
Grandma.

414
00:37:14,364 --> 00:37:18,061
Did I forget
to take the garbage out?

415
00:37:22,739 --> 00:37:25,731
I can't remember.

416
00:37:36,486 --> 00:37:42,618
If you forgive me, wake up.

417
00:37:44,294 --> 00:37:46,626
Please?

418
00:37:52,936 --> 00:37:58,772
Because I can't sleep
if you don't.

419
00:38:05,949 --> 00:38:09,407
Survival instincts
are all the same.

420
00:38:09,452 --> 00:38:13,855
Overfeeding may not
improve growth.

421
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:16,916
It may diminish
evolutionary impulses.

422
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:20,418
So, the drive
to reproduce declines.

423
00:38:20,463 --> 00:38:23,296
Some of you
can't bring them into bloom.

424
00:38:23,333 --> 00:38:26,700
You're overdoing the care.

425
00:38:26,736 --> 00:38:31,435
Like, say...Jian Ting-Ting.

426
00:38:31,474 --> 00:38:33,408
Jian Ting-Ting!

427
00:38:34,444 --> 00:38:39,347
She stays up all night
nurturing her plant.

428
00:38:39,382 --> 00:38:44,376
The others must be slacking.
See how they bloom?

429
00:38:53,897 --> 00:38:57,856
It begins to acquire
signs of human life.

430
00:38:57,901 --> 00:39:00,870
It begins to think...

431
00:39:00,904 --> 00:39:05,534
then matures
into a living entity...

432
00:39:05,575 --> 00:39:09,443
and becomes
our most devoted companion.

433
00:39:09,479 --> 00:39:13,745
That's the limitless future
for computer games.

434
00:39:13,783 --> 00:39:15,842
We haven't yet surpassed...

435
00:39:15,885 --> 00:39:19,582
fighting and killing games.

436
00:39:19,622 --> 00:39:22,523
Not because we haven't fully
understood computers.

437
00:39:22,559 --> 00:39:25,027
But because we haven't fully
understood ourselves...

438
00:39:25,061 --> 00:39:26,926
human beings.

439
00:40:00,096 --> 00:40:03,554
Our future collaboration can be
based on these objectives.

440
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:06,091
This is the way forward.

441
00:40:06,136 --> 00:40:10,197
These are uncharted waters...

442
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,641
so I understand
your hesitations.

443
00:40:13,676 --> 00:40:16,770
But this cutting-edge approach
puts us well ahead...

444
00:40:16,813 --> 00:40:19,509
of any future competition.

445
00:40:19,549 --> 00:40:23,076
So there are ample grounds
for optimism.

446
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:25,815
That concludes my presentation,
thank you.

447
00:40:35,632 --> 00:40:37,725
Wonderful!

448
00:40:38,735 --> 00:40:43,900
We learned a lot today!

449
00:40:45,208 --> 00:40:47,574
Really good.

450
00:40:47,610 --> 00:40:50,010
No one's dared try it before...

451
00:40:50,046 --> 00:40:52,844
but we have to pay for it?

452
00:40:52,882 --> 00:40:56,374
I thought we were just buying
a brand name, pure and simple.

453
00:40:56,419 --> 00:40:58,353
I liked what he said.

454
00:40:58,388 --> 00:41:01,824
It's a risk worth taking.

455
00:41:01,858 --> 00:41:05,191
Shit, you were
against it before!

456
00:41:05,228 --> 00:41:07,958
He's too expensive,
not worth it.

457
00:41:07,997 --> 00:41:10,124
I found a local copycat of Ota.

458
00:41:10,166 --> 00:41:13,567
Calls itself "Ato."
Close enough?

459
00:41:13,603 --> 00:41:17,130
Forget the names!
What about performance?

460
00:41:17,173 --> 00:41:19,698
Small return on small risks.
Big deal!

461
00:41:19,742 --> 00:41:21,710
It beats big losses
on big risks.

462
00:41:21,744 --> 00:41:23,905
Let's not sign with him yet.

463
00:41:23,947 --> 00:41:27,906
Find an excuse
to send him back to Tokyo.

464
00:41:27,951 --> 00:41:31,045
That's not nice!
Who has to tell him?

465
00:41:33,256 --> 00:41:37,352
NJ, take Mr. Ota
to dinner tonight.

466
00:41:37,393 --> 00:41:39,827
Tell him we're keen to sign...

467
00:41:39,863 --> 00:41:44,232
but play hard to get.
Let's buy some time.

468
00:41:44,267 --> 00:41:47,794
-Why me?
-You look honest!

469
00:41:47,837 --> 00:41:49,862
So? Am I pretending?

470
00:41:49,906 --> 00:41:52,841
What's wrong
with a little acting?

471
00:41:52,876 --> 00:41:56,903
So honesty is an act?
And friendship? Business?

472
00:41:56,946 --> 00:41:59,005
Is anything real left?

473
00:42:26,009 --> 00:42:31,037
Don't mind
what I said about acting.

474
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:34,948
We've been a team
since schooldays.

475
00:42:34,984 --> 00:42:37,282
Sure, why else
do I stick around?

476
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:42,451
By the way, Sherry's husband,
Rodney Breitner...

477
00:42:42,492 --> 00:42:45,984
He's from Chicago,
big in insurance.

478
00:42:46,029 --> 00:42:47,860
Good reputation.

479
00:42:47,897 --> 00:42:51,833
I had a long talk with her
on the phone.

480
00:42:51,868 --> 00:42:54,894
She asked me to say "Hi."

481
00:42:54,938 --> 00:42:58,101
Give her a call sometime.

482
00:42:58,141 --> 00:43:02,976
Just as a classmate,
not an ex-lover.

483
00:43:15,425 --> 00:43:16,722
It's not locked.

484
00:43:16,759 --> 00:43:17,953
You're home early.

485
00:43:17,994 --> 00:43:19,985
I was next door.

486
00:43:25,468 --> 00:43:27,299
Hello? Dad!

487
00:43:27,337 --> 00:43:31,933
Yang-Yang hid the phone.
I couldn't find it.

488
00:43:31,975 --> 00:43:34,205
It was under the seat cushion.

489
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:42,549
We're cooking a health-food
dinner and you'll miss it!

490
00:43:44,087 --> 00:43:46,419
OK, next time.

491
00:43:47,423 --> 00:43:49,653
Yes, I'll tell Ma.

492
00:43:57,934 --> 00:43:59,697
That was my dad.

493
00:43:59,736 --> 00:44:03,638
He's going to miss
my masterpiece.

494
00:44:03,673 --> 00:44:06,233
Well, that's his loss.

495
00:44:14,183 --> 00:44:16,014
So, what's next?

496
00:44:16,052 --> 00:44:18,145
Check that page.

497
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:25,953
We're out of carrots.

498
00:44:25,995 --> 00:44:27,986
We have some.

499
00:44:36,806 --> 00:44:42,108
Next time, I'll show you
my pad in Shanghai.

500
00:44:42,145 --> 00:44:43,942
My daughter's in.

501
00:44:46,182 --> 00:44:47,774
My daughter Lili.

502
00:44:47,817 --> 00:44:49,375
Call him Uncle.

503
00:44:49,419 --> 00:44:51,284
Call me Allen.

504
00:44:53,356 --> 00:44:57,725
You're cooking?

505
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:00,752
Nice place you have here.

506
00:45:00,797 --> 00:45:03,357
Hi, Mrs. Jiang.

507
00:45:03,399 --> 00:45:07,733
Ting-Ting, you're cooking too?
Big job, isn't it?

508
00:45:07,770 --> 00:45:09,670
It's fun!

509
00:45:09,705 --> 00:45:12,173
Join us for a health-food feast!

510
00:45:12,208 --> 00:45:14,699
We're going to the movies.

511
00:45:14,744 --> 00:45:18,009
That's nice. Hold on.

512
00:45:18,047 --> 00:45:20,641
Allen, make yourself at home.

513
00:45:20,683 --> 00:45:22,378
I'm fine.

514
00:45:23,719 --> 00:45:25,949
We're going to the movies?

515
00:45:30,226 --> 00:45:35,391
It's on me.
Treat Ting-Ting to a good show.

516
00:45:37,633 --> 00:45:39,863
Your daughter is a musician!

517
00:45:39,902 --> 00:45:43,702
She certainly is.
She's won prizes.

518
00:45:45,541 --> 00:45:48,999
Lots of comedies.
Which one do you fancy?

519
00:45:54,217 --> 00:45:59,655
We can do something else
if you'd prefer.

520
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:11,933
Welcome.

521
00:46:13,336 --> 00:46:16,396
Can I help you?

522
00:46:16,439 --> 00:46:17,804
Our friend is...

523
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:20,104
They're my friends.

524
00:46:22,712 --> 00:46:24,703
Hi, Fatty.

525
00:46:24,747 --> 00:46:27,910
I thought you were cooking.

526
00:46:28,918 --> 00:46:30,613
What are you doing?

527
00:46:30,653 --> 00:46:32,644
Checking these.

528
00:46:38,895 --> 00:46:41,921
I don't come here every day.

529
00:46:45,134 --> 00:46:48,467
Wait for me
at the usual place, OK?

530
00:46:53,376 --> 00:46:57,210
"Fatty"? He's so thin.

531
00:46:57,246 --> 00:47:01,205
Maybe he used to be fat.

532
00:47:03,819 --> 00:47:08,813
You shouldn't mind waiting.
He's often waited for you.

533
00:47:08,858 --> 00:47:11,292
It's not that.

534
00:47:12,361 --> 00:47:14,795
He'll be here soon.

535
00:47:16,866 --> 00:47:20,165
Want to be alone?

536
00:47:21,204 --> 00:47:23,468
I can go home.

537
00:47:26,075 --> 00:47:27,872
OK.

538
00:47:31,147 --> 00:47:34,776
Don't worry. He'll be here soon.

539
00:47:55,871 --> 00:47:59,466
Keep it down!
This isn't your own place!

540
00:47:59,508 --> 00:48:03,672
Hey, you seem
to be disturbing her.

541
00:48:03,713 --> 00:48:05,112
Cool it.

542
00:48:05,147 --> 00:48:09,140
It's not our fault that
your boyfriend stood you up.

543
00:48:09,185 --> 00:48:10,550
Leave her alone.

544
00:48:10,586 --> 00:48:13,885
Been in the army too long.
I'm not used to this.

545
00:48:13,923 --> 00:48:15,891
Don't worry.

546
00:48:15,925 --> 00:48:19,884
I may look rough,
but I have a heart of gold.

547
00:48:19,929 --> 00:48:21,863
Let it be, OK?

548
00:50:03,099 --> 00:50:05,590
This must be fish.

549
00:54:08,377 --> 00:54:10,345
Where's he from? He's good.

550
00:54:10,379 --> 00:54:12,347
Japan. I just met him.

551
00:54:12,381 --> 00:54:15,839
He plays well
for a computer guy.

552
00:54:15,884 --> 00:54:19,376
Bring more friends like him.

553
00:54:19,421 --> 00:54:22,254
Great for atmosphere.

554
00:54:22,291 --> 00:54:25,522
Times are hard.

555
00:54:25,561 --> 00:54:29,292
We're in trouble.

556
00:54:29,331 --> 00:54:31,265
Come more often.

557
00:56:39,261 --> 00:56:43,288
Sherry? It's me, NJ.

558
00:56:43,332 --> 00:56:49,464
I'm glad it's the machine.
Otherwise, I'd be tongue-tied.

559
00:56:50,973 --> 00:56:54,932
Da-Da said he spoke to you.

560
00:56:54,977 --> 00:56:58,572
He says you're doing well.
I'm so glad.

561
00:56:59,581 --> 00:57:05,542
Before, I'd heard
your life was tough.

562
00:57:07,422 --> 00:57:10,687
I felt it might be my fault.

563
00:57:13,061 --> 00:57:17,930
You asked why I vanished
without a word thirty years ago.

564
00:57:17,966 --> 00:57:22,266
There were many reasons.

565
00:57:22,304 --> 00:57:26,104
Now they all sound stupid.

566
00:57:27,442 --> 00:57:32,311
I'm glad that
you have a good life.

567
00:57:32,347 --> 00:57:34,815
I'm really happy for you.

568
00:57:34,850 --> 00:57:39,344
All my best wishes.

569
00:58:25,968 --> 00:58:30,200
I have nothing to say to Mother.

570
00:58:33,809 --> 00:58:40,874
I tell her
the same things every day.

571
00:58:40,916 --> 00:58:42,907
What I did in the morning.

572
00:58:42,951 --> 00:58:44,316
In the afternoon.

573
00:58:44,353 --> 00:58:46,378
In the evening.

574
00:58:48,857 --> 00:58:51,826
It only takes a minute.

575
00:59:02,537 --> 00:59:04,471
I can't bear it.

576
00:59:07,509 --> 00:59:11,741
I have so little.

577
00:59:14,883 --> 00:59:17,681
How can it be so little?

578
00:59:21,089 --> 00:59:26,288
I live a blank!

579
00:59:27,329 --> 00:59:30,196
Every day...every day...

580
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:34,860
I'm like a fool!

581
00:59:37,406 --> 00:59:41,604
What am I doing every day?

582
00:59:59,861 --> 01:00:06,767
If I ended up like her
one day...

583
01:00:32,794 --> 01:00:37,060
I'll ask the nurse to read
the newspaper to her.

584
01:00:37,099 --> 01:00:40,091
She'll have something new
to listen to, OK?

585
01:00:42,137 --> 01:00:43,968
I was busy!

586
01:00:44,006 --> 01:00:48,170
So was l! Why should I wait
all day for you to call?

587
01:00:48,210 --> 01:00:51,304
-Where were you last night?
-Why should I tell you?

588
01:00:51,346 --> 01:00:55,908
You think I'm some dumb bitch?

589
01:00:55,951 --> 01:00:57,919
Why should I wait for you?

590
01:00:57,953 --> 01:00:59,921
Give me back the cell phone!

591
01:00:59,955 --> 01:01:01,252
What are you doing?

592
01:01:01,289 --> 01:01:02,916
You asking me?

593
01:01:02,958 --> 01:01:04,983
Get the hell out!

594
01:01:05,027 --> 01:01:06,961
Fuck you, you nosy bitch!

595
01:01:06,995 --> 01:01:09,759
You're a fucking joke!

596
01:01:37,592 --> 01:01:39,685
Yang-Yang, the lift's here.

597
01:01:44,066 --> 01:01:48,935
Don't stare at people like that.
It's rude.

598
01:01:48,970 --> 01:01:50,938
People will be cross.

599
01:01:50,972 --> 01:01:53,065
I wanted to know
why she's unhappy.

600
01:01:53,108 --> 01:01:54,905
I can't see from behind.

601
01:01:54,943 --> 01:01:57,138
How do you know she's unhappy?

602
01:01:57,179 --> 01:02:00,808
She had a big fight last night.

603
01:02:00,849 --> 01:02:02,817
I could hear from my room.

604
01:02:02,851 --> 01:02:04,648
Really?

605
01:02:14,596 --> 01:02:19,260
Daddy, I can't see what you see
and you can't see what I see.

606
01:02:19,301 --> 01:02:22,293
How can I know what you see?

607
01:02:23,305 --> 01:02:26,297
Good question.
I never thought of that.

608
01:02:26,341 --> 01:02:28,400
That's why we need a camera.

609
01:02:28,443 --> 01:02:31,003
Do you want to play with one?

610
01:02:31,046 --> 01:02:35,005
Daddy, can we only know
half of the truth?

611
01:02:36,017 --> 01:02:38,076
What? I don't get it.

612
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:40,714
I can only see what's in front,
not what's behind.

613
01:02:40,755 --> 01:02:45,124
So I can only know
half of the truth, right?

614
01:02:47,429 --> 01:02:49,397
You have
a lot of questions today!

615
01:02:49,431 --> 01:02:51,399
Let me ask you one...

616
01:02:51,433 --> 01:02:55,927
Where shall we take Mummy
this weekend to cheer her up?

617
01:02:55,971 --> 01:02:58,064
You can decide.

618
01:03:20,896 --> 01:03:22,693
Min-Min!

619
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:27,165
Still here?

620
01:03:32,507 --> 01:03:34,998
Nancy...

621
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:07,765
Where can I go?

622
01:05:30,992 --> 01:05:33,825
What are you doing?

623
01:05:33,862 --> 01:05:35,454
What are you snapping?

624
01:05:35,497 --> 01:05:38,364
I want to show Mummy
the mosquitoes.

625
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:41,233
Mosquitoes? Can you snap them?

626
01:05:41,269 --> 01:05:44,966
Daddy said so,
or people won't believe me.

627
01:05:47,642 --> 01:05:49,667
That's not our place.

628
01:05:49,711 --> 01:05:51,178
I know.

629
01:05:51,212 --> 01:05:55,706
Your Mum and I both think
they are strange.

630
01:05:55,750 --> 01:06:00,653
Is Mummy home?
I haven't seen her lately.

631
01:06:58,780 --> 01:07:01,613
My boss is here. Bye.

632
01:07:02,784 --> 01:07:07,949
Your partners are in a meeting
with Ato Company.

633
01:07:07,989 --> 01:07:10,617
They want you to join them.

634
01:07:10,658 --> 01:07:12,148
Ato?

635
01:07:12,193 --> 01:07:14,218
Isn't it Ota? I wasn't told.

636
01:07:14,262 --> 01:07:18,096
No. Ato is Ota's copycat.

637
01:07:18,133 --> 01:07:21,000
Confusing, isn't it?

638
01:07:23,438 --> 01:07:25,429
General Manager's office.

639
01:07:25,473 --> 01:07:28,203
The President's in a meeting.

640
01:07:28,243 --> 01:07:30,905
May I say who called?

641
01:07:30,945 --> 01:07:33,539
No? Thank you.

642
01:07:35,417 --> 01:07:37,009
General Manager's office.

643
01:07:38,453 --> 01:07:43,823
My boss is here.
I'll call you later.

644
01:07:47,028 --> 01:07:48,859
General Manager's office.

645
01:07:48,897 --> 01:07:50,990
Hold on.

646
01:07:51,032 --> 01:07:53,523
NJ, long-distance from the U.S.

647
01:09:09,577 --> 01:09:11,704
I knew it was you.

648
01:09:11,746 --> 01:09:14,977
You take care of the company.

649
01:09:15,016 --> 01:09:17,416
I'm staying home.

650
01:09:17,452 --> 01:09:20,046
Call me when you need me.

651
01:09:46,748 --> 01:09:49,546
Seems I'm the only one left
to keep you company.

652
01:09:50,552 --> 01:09:54,147
When Min-Min was home,
I thought...

653
01:09:54,188 --> 01:09:56,850
she'd solve
all the problems around here.

654
01:09:56,891 --> 01:09:58,791
But now...

655
01:09:58,826 --> 01:10:00,987
there's no one to do it.

656
01:10:01,029 --> 01:10:04,430
And I really don't know
when she'll be back.

657
01:10:07,101 --> 01:10:10,070
It's hard for me
to mumble like this.

658
01:10:10,104 --> 01:10:12,834
I hope you won't be offended
if I say...

659
01:10:12,874 --> 01:10:15,001
it's like praying.

660
01:10:15,043 --> 01:10:19,173
I'm not sure if the other party
can hear me...

661
01:10:20,181 --> 01:10:24,618
and I'm not sure
if I'm sincere enough.

662
01:10:25,987 --> 01:10:28,888
Frankly...

663
01:10:28,923 --> 01:10:34,657
there's very little
I'm sure about these days.

664
01:10:36,464 --> 01:10:41,128
I wake up feeling unsure
about almost everything.

665
01:10:41,169 --> 01:10:44,935
And I wonder
why I wake up at all...

666
01:10:44,973 --> 01:10:49,273
just to face the same
uncertainties again and again.

667
01:10:52,213 --> 01:10:56,172
Would you want to wake up,
if you were me?

668
01:11:00,221 --> 01:11:04,021
Maybe Yang-Yang's right.

669
01:11:04,058 --> 01:11:07,118
You've lived so many more years.

670
01:11:07,161 --> 01:11:10,562
Other than these questions
we can't answer...

671
01:11:10,598 --> 01:11:13,032
what is there to tell you?

672
01:11:14,936 --> 01:11:18,201
Anyhow, I guess
you don't blame Yang-Yang...

673
01:11:18,239 --> 01:11:20,571
for not talking to you.

674
01:11:22,410 --> 01:11:25,811
In many ways, he takes after me.

675
01:11:26,848 --> 01:11:28,816
Really.

676
01:11:50,605 --> 01:11:54,666
Which brand do you want?

677
01:11:54,709 --> 01:11:56,142
The same one.

678
01:11:56,177 --> 01:11:58,202
Which was that?

679
01:12:02,850 --> 01:12:04,340
This one.

680
01:12:04,385 --> 01:12:06,751
Right, hold on.

681
01:12:07,889 --> 01:12:10,585
Shida Road Art Portraits.
Can I help you?

682
01:12:13,027 --> 01:12:15,894
And the surname is...?

683
01:12:15,930 --> 01:12:18,023
OK, I'll check.

684
01:12:57,205 --> 01:12:59,332
What the...?

685
01:13:08,282 --> 01:13:11,843
What the hell are all these?

686
01:13:11,886 --> 01:13:15,185
Oh, I get it.

687
01:13:17,191 --> 01:13:19,853
This is what they call
avant-garde art!

688
01:13:19,894 --> 01:13:21,885
Amazing!

689
01:13:21,929 --> 01:13:24,227
Class,
time for some art appreciation!

690
01:13:24,265 --> 01:13:26,460
What's it for?

691
01:13:26,501 --> 01:13:29,868
It's art! Expensive art!

692
01:13:29,904 --> 01:13:31,929
Why is art expensive?

693
01:13:31,973 --> 01:13:34,669
Why take so many?

694
01:13:34,709 --> 01:13:40,409
Look at him!
Our newfound maestro!

695
01:13:40,448 --> 01:13:44,145
A rare genius in our school!

696
01:13:44,185 --> 01:13:46,312
Didn't you love to talk back?

697
01:13:46,354 --> 01:13:49,152
Take after your father, right?

698
01:13:49,190 --> 01:13:52,853
Tell him you are caught
in the act.

699
01:13:52,894 --> 01:13:54,225
Call him...

700
01:13:54,262 --> 01:13:56,958
and ask for help!

701
01:13:56,998 --> 01:13:58,488
Scared?

702
01:13:58,533 --> 01:14:00,967
Stand there until he comes!

703
01:14:02,270 --> 01:14:04,568
Don't pull that face at me!

704
01:14:04,605 --> 01:14:06,539
Turn around against the wall!

705
01:14:09,577 --> 01:14:12,375
I dare you, do that again!

706
01:14:22,924 --> 01:14:25,552
How was it the other night?

707
01:14:27,395 --> 01:14:29,659
Isn't Lili home yet?

708
01:14:35,670 --> 01:14:37,968
Could you give this to her?

709
01:14:41,576 --> 01:14:45,103
Uh...nothing.

710
01:15:15,209 --> 01:15:17,006
This...

711
01:15:19,680 --> 01:15:21,511
is for you.

712
01:15:22,984 --> 01:15:24,918
-It's...
-I know.

713
01:15:36,330 --> 01:15:38,321
"Wen-Ho Lee,

01:16:31,652 --> 01:16:34,212
Been to McDonald's again?

725
01:16:34,255 --> 01:16:35,916
Why so moody?

726
01:16:36,924 --> 01:16:39,893
He got picked on.
Girls, right?

727
01:17:04,986 --> 01:17:06,954
Master wants to see you.

728
01:17:06,988 --> 01:17:09,582
Please come in, Master.

729
01:17:10,791 --> 01:17:14,989
Ting-Ting, Nancy is here!
Will you make some tea?

730
01:17:15,029 --> 01:17:16,496
Have you eaten?

731
01:17:16,530 --> 01:17:18,225
We just did.

732
01:17:18,265 --> 01:17:22,065
First, Min-Min
is doing well in the temple.

733
01:17:22,103 --> 01:17:24,970
Master wanted to visit you...

734
01:17:25,006 --> 01:17:29,375
so as to know
Min-Min's family better.

735
01:17:45,493 --> 01:17:50,897
Mr. Jian, most people
neglect spiritual disciplines.

736
01:17:50,931 --> 01:17:53,729
So you missed Min-Min's signals.

737
01:17:53,768 --> 01:17:56,259
Yang-Yang,
don't run around naked!

738
01:17:56,303 --> 01:18:00,569
You should join us
on the mountain.

739
01:18:00,608 --> 01:18:05,910
A purified soul helps the gods
to answer prayers.

740
01:18:05,946 --> 01:18:09,905
Nothing would help
your wife more.

741
01:18:09,950 --> 01:18:14,353
Like everyone, my wife and l
need help from others.

742
01:18:14,388 --> 01:18:19,052
But maybe I'd anger the gods
by making too many requests.

743
01:18:19,093 --> 01:18:24,360
If I turn to them only for
the big things I can't handle...

744
01:18:24,398 --> 01:18:27,299
my sincerity
may impress them more.

745
01:18:27,334 --> 01:18:29,199
But...

746
01:18:29,236 --> 01:18:33,366
I haven't yet had troubles
I couldn't handle myself.

747
01:18:33,407 --> 01:18:38,242
These thoughts
seem interesting...

748
01:18:44,952 --> 01:18:48,945
They do this work voluntarily.

749
01:18:48,989 --> 01:18:53,449
Your encouragement
means so much.

750
01:18:53,494 --> 01:18:56,122
I see.

751
01:18:56,163 --> 01:18:58,290
Do you take checks?

752
01:18:58,332 --> 01:19:00,266
Of course.

753
01:19:49,183 --> 01:19:51,913
Thanks, NJ.

754
01:19:51,952 --> 01:19:55,388
Your wife is in good hands.

755
01:19:55,422 --> 01:19:57,287
Thanks for all the help.

756
01:19:57,324 --> 01:19:59,224
It's our pleasure.

757
01:20:16,810 --> 01:20:19,938
Lend me $300.
I have nothing on me.

758
01:20:19,980 --> 01:20:23,541
A cab driver's waiting.
I owe him $300.

759
01:20:27,821 --> 01:20:30,187
You'd die without me!

760
01:20:31,725 --> 01:20:33,955
Aren't you lucky?

761
01:20:33,994 --> 01:20:36,724
The clothes you left
are still here.

762
01:20:37,932 --> 01:20:39,991
Do they still fit?

763
01:20:41,669 --> 01:20:45,070
How did you get into this mess?

764
01:20:45,105 --> 01:20:47,369
She went crazy and threw me out.

765
01:20:49,143 --> 01:20:51,043
I went to NJ's place...

766
01:20:51,078 --> 01:20:54,070
He threw you out, too?

767
01:20:54,114 --> 01:20:57,208
I still owe him money.

768
01:20:57,251 --> 01:20:59,742
I was ashamed to borrow...

769
01:21:01,021 --> 01:21:03,785
from him again.

770
01:21:03,824 --> 01:21:08,921
Didn't I give you nine million
to clear your debt with NJ?

771
01:21:08,963 --> 01:21:10,897
I let Piggy invest that.

772
01:21:10,931 --> 01:21:15,231
He says it's tripled in value.

773
01:21:15,269 --> 01:21:16,736
Piggy?

774
01:21:18,906 --> 01:21:22,501
I hear he's on the run in China.

775
01:21:22,543 --> 01:21:25,910
Bullshit.

776
01:21:25,946 --> 01:21:30,974
I won big on mahjong
at his place last week.

777
01:21:31,018 --> 01:21:32,986
Cash?

778
01:21:52,806 --> 01:21:55,502
I see.

779
01:21:55,542 --> 01:21:59,103
Let's visit him tomorrow
to check.

780
01:21:59,146 --> 01:22:01,046
OK?

781
01:22:04,451 --> 01:22:07,887
Thank you so much.
It'll only take a minute.

782
01:22:07,921 --> 01:22:12,153
No problem, just shut the door
when you leave.

783
01:22:12,192 --> 01:22:14,217
Don't tell anyone I let you in!

784
01:22:14,261 --> 01:22:16,491
Trust me.

785
01:22:16,530 --> 01:22:19,556
Fatso, learn from your wife!

786
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:22,831
See how easy she handles me?

787
01:22:22,870 --> 01:22:24,701
Thanks a lot.

788
01:22:34,014 --> 01:22:38,474
They're no slouches,
cleaned the place out.

789
01:22:42,456 --> 01:22:44,981
How much money have I got left?

790
01:22:45,025 --> 01:22:47,118
Barely!

791
01:22:47,161 --> 01:22:49,925
Didn't we just make ten million?

792
01:22:49,963 --> 01:22:52,397
Values can go down, too!

793
01:22:55,836 --> 01:22:58,566
Shit, what are these?

794
01:23:03,277 --> 01:23:05,211
You mean...

795
01:23:07,648 --> 01:23:09,878
I'm broke again.

796
01:23:09,917 --> 01:23:13,216
Why did you trust
a guy like Piggy?

797
01:23:16,957 --> 01:23:19,221
Come here.

798
01:23:19,259 --> 01:23:23,252
Remember this:. Trust no one!

799
01:23:23,297 --> 01:23:25,925
It's just junk.

800
01:23:25,966 --> 01:23:29,026
Fucking useless!

801
01:23:30,170 --> 01:23:32,138
Are you skipping
audio/visual class?

802
01:23:32,172 --> 01:23:33,434
Buzz off!

803
01:23:44,618 --> 01:23:46,085
Here she comes!

804
01:23:46,120 --> 01:23:47,917
Quick!

805
01:23:50,724 --> 01:23:52,123
Good morning, Dean.

806
01:23:52,159 --> 01:23:54,354
Lovely new outfit!

807
01:23:59,333 --> 01:24:02,200
You little fuckers! Don't run!

808
01:24:02,236 --> 01:24:05,171
I'll get you! You fuckers!

809
01:24:15,082 --> 01:24:19,610
"Warm, damp air rises
as the earth heats up.

810
01:24:19,653 --> 01:24:23,020
"At high altitude, it condenses
into small droplets..."

811
01:24:23,056 --> 01:24:24,580
Get in, quick!

812
01:24:24,625 --> 01:24:28,493
"This creates
these beautiful clouds."

813
01:24:29,596 --> 01:24:31,894
"To the quiet rhythms

their beauty."

01:24:48,916 --> 01:24:52,215

"and form a negative-charged
front."

822
01:25:03,497 --> 01:25:06,227
Close the door!
Don't just stand there!

823
01:25:07,534 --> 01:25:09,434
Find a seat, quick!

824
01:25:09,470 --> 01:25:12,166

"That was the beginning

I can't help you!
You two can't fight like this!

835
01:26:33,053 --> 01:26:36,420
Everyone envied you!
You can't do this!

836
01:26:36,456 --> 01:26:38,185
I'm very disappointed!

837
01:26:38,225 --> 01:26:40,250
What sense does it make?

838
01:26:41,862 --> 01:26:43,830
I haven't seen her in ages.

839
01:26:43,864 --> 01:26:46,924
Of course not!
You mistreated her!

840
01:26:46,967 --> 01:26:50,300
Lili is so lovely!
How could you?

841
01:26:51,471 --> 01:26:53,803
Is she seeing other guys?

842
01:26:55,943 --> 01:26:58,002
I didn't say that.

843
01:26:58,045 --> 01:26:59,979
You should know better.

844
01:27:00,013 --> 01:27:01,275
Tough lady!

845
01:27:56,506 --> 01:27:58,633
How can this be?

846
01:28:03,246 --> 01:28:06,875
How can this be?

847
01:28:12,689 --> 01:28:15,385
Open the door!

848
01:28:15,425 --> 01:28:18,019
Why is it suddenly locked?

849
01:28:19,095 --> 01:28:20,824
Open the door!

850
01:28:22,432 --> 01:28:25,265
Not ashamed, are you?

851
01:28:28,938 --> 01:28:31,498
How can this be?

852
01:28:31,541 --> 01:28:35,978
Lili, it's not how it looks.

853
01:28:36,012 --> 01:28:37,673
How can this be?

854
01:28:37,714 --> 01:28:39,773
What is it, then?

855
01:28:39,816 --> 01:28:41,010
Listen to me.

856
01:28:41,051 --> 01:28:43,485
You're my teacher!
You're my mother!

857
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:46,114
You should be teaching me
English!

858
01:28:46,156 --> 01:28:48,181
Teachers are human, too!

859
01:28:48,224 --> 01:28:50,715
I'll tell the principal!

860
01:28:50,760 --> 01:28:52,193
Listen to me!

861
01:28:52,228 --> 01:28:53,627
Listen to what?

862
01:28:53,663 --> 01:28:55,654
Excuse me.

863
01:28:55,698 --> 01:28:58,861
It's not what you think, Lili!

864
01:29:31,568 --> 01:29:33,695
Look this way!

865
01:29:33,736 --> 01:29:35,931
Let Daddy videotape you.

866
01:29:38,441 --> 01:29:40,341
Still crying...

867
01:29:56,793 --> 01:29:58,590
Look this way.

868
01:30:00,396 --> 01:30:01,761
The eyes...

869
01:30:06,936 --> 01:30:10,565
What? You're moved?

870
01:30:10,607 --> 01:30:13,201
Suddenly it all seems...

871
01:30:13,243 --> 01:30:14,870
so cruel.

872
01:30:17,313 --> 01:30:19,247
What's wrong?

873
01:30:20,717 --> 01:30:24,380
Is his horoscope really so bad?

874
01:30:26,556 --> 01:30:28,888
Didn't you say...

875
01:30:28,925 --> 01:30:33,828
we can counter it
by giving him a lucky name?

876
01:30:34,831 --> 01:30:36,594
It's all right.

877
01:30:41,371 --> 01:30:42,998
A-Di!

878
01:30:43,039 --> 01:30:45,303
Congratulations!

879
01:30:45,341 --> 01:30:47,002
You're the first!

880
01:30:48,111 --> 01:30:49,874
Let's see the baby.

881
01:30:51,581 --> 01:30:55,415
Like you, but more handsome!

882
01:30:55,451 --> 01:30:58,648
So they say! I can't tell.

883
01:30:58,688 --> 01:31:01,282
To wish you luck...

884
01:31:02,992 --> 01:31:05,620
How's his horoscope?
What's his name?

885
01:31:05,662 --> 01:31:10,599
The name is crucial.
I'm still working on it.

886
01:31:10,633 --> 01:31:12,498
Right, it's for life!

887
01:31:12,535 --> 01:31:14,298
Have some tea.

888
01:31:14,337 --> 01:31:19,104
Congratulations!
Good job, A-Di!

889
01:31:19,142 --> 01:31:20,370
Migo!

890
01:31:20,410 --> 01:31:23,504
I hear you've set
the world to rights!

891
01:31:23,546 --> 01:31:27,380
Made peace between
your wife and Yun-Yun!

892
01:31:27,417 --> 01:31:29,510
Let's drink to that!

893
01:31:29,552 --> 01:31:33,386
Here, some expensive red wine!

894
01:31:35,258 --> 01:31:39,854
All your old classmates
are relieved!

895
01:31:41,364 --> 01:31:44,094
Lovely little baby!

896
01:31:44,133 --> 01:31:46,795
Looks more like the mother
than the father.

897
01:31:46,836 --> 01:31:48,463
You sure?

898
01:31:51,374 --> 01:31:53,501
Go fetch the baby pictures.

899
01:31:53,543 --> 01:31:55,909
What pictures?

900
01:31:55,945 --> 01:31:58,539
Behind the screen!

901
01:32:00,583 --> 01:32:03,347
Had a good eye, didn't l?

902
01:32:03,386 --> 01:32:05,946
I hired Xiao Yan
fresh out of school.

903
01:32:05,989 --> 01:32:07,718
See what happens?

904
01:32:07,757 --> 01:32:11,284
You should thank me, Xiao Yan.

905
01:32:11,327 --> 01:32:13,488
Right, you should.

906
01:32:13,529 --> 01:32:15,622
Get Migo in here.

907
01:32:22,739 --> 01:32:26,539
Why is that bitch here?
Did you invite her?

908
01:32:26,576 --> 01:32:30,945
Of course not!
What the hell is going on?

909
01:32:34,050 --> 01:32:37,349
Why did you bring Yun-Yun?

910
01:32:37,387 --> 01:32:43,257
She said you invited her,
and we brought the wine.

911
01:32:43,292 --> 01:32:44,850
You didn't invite her!

912
01:32:44,894 --> 01:32:47,658
You think I'm nuts?

913
01:32:47,697 --> 01:32:50,427
What a letdown!

914
01:32:50,466 --> 01:32:53,765
We all thought you two made up.

915
01:32:53,803 --> 01:32:57,000
We were so glad to hear it.

916
01:32:57,040 --> 01:32:59,907
That's what she told you all?

917
01:32:59,942 --> 01:33:03,969
Weren't you so friendly
to each other just now?

918
01:33:04,013 --> 01:33:07,176
Forget the past,
make a fresh start.

919
01:33:07,216 --> 01:33:09,776
Let's be happy.

920
01:33:09,819 --> 01:33:11,980
Fuck, it's a setup!

921
01:33:12,021 --> 01:33:13,181
What?

922
01:33:13,222 --> 01:33:14,814
It's a fucking setup!

923
01:33:17,860 --> 01:33:21,921
Look! Throw her out right now!

924
01:33:21,964 --> 01:33:25,229
Come now...

925
01:33:26,436 --> 01:33:29,462
Harmony is a precious thing!

926
01:33:29,505 --> 01:33:33,703
Think of
our classmates' feelings!

927
01:33:33,743 --> 01:33:35,734
It's for everyone's good.

928
01:33:35,778 --> 01:33:39,077
Bullshit!
For everyone's good?

929
01:33:39,115 --> 01:33:41,777
What about me?
Where does that leave me?

930
01:33:41,818 --> 01:33:44,787
Your behavior isn't helping.

931
01:33:44,821 --> 01:33:48,814
Yun-Yun is our old friend.

932
01:33:50,093 --> 01:33:52,027
Your wife
is out of line here.

933
01:33:52,061 --> 01:33:53,221
What the fuck?

934
01:33:54,997 --> 01:33:58,023
What the fuck are you
playing at, Yun-Yun?

935
01:33:58,067 --> 01:34:00,092
She doesn't mean that!

936
01:34:00,136 --> 01:34:01,626
Trying to wreck the party?

937
01:34:01,671 --> 01:34:04,936
You're wrecking it, not her!

938
01:34:04,974 --> 01:34:06,441
Xiao Yan, don't get me wrong.

939
01:34:06,476 --> 01:34:09,343
I'm sincerely happy
for both of you, believe me.

940
01:34:09,378 --> 01:34:12,575
So I'm the villain?
What did I do to deserve this?

941
01:34:12,615 --> 01:34:15,584
Xiao Yan! Take some advice!

942
01:34:15,618 --> 01:34:19,918
You should repent! Our
friendship doesn't deserve this!

943
01:34:19,956 --> 01:34:23,915
Don't leave! Stay here!

944
01:34:23,960 --> 01:34:25,951
Long time no see! Don't go!

945
01:34:25,995 --> 01:34:29,328
Classmates, calm her down
or Yun-Yun will leave!

946
01:34:29,365 --> 01:34:31,959
This is not right!

947
01:34:32,001 --> 01:34:35,493
Xiao Yan invited us!
We are her guests!

948
01:34:35,538 --> 01:34:38,473
See? I'm the host!

949
01:34:38,508 --> 01:34:40,635
You're full of shit!

950
01:34:40,676 --> 01:34:43,076
This is not fair!

951
01:34:43,112 --> 01:34:46,047
Who asked your opinion?

952
01:34:46,082 --> 01:34:47,879
You lowlife!

953
01:35:03,566 --> 01:35:05,796
This is all your fault!

954
01:35:05,835 --> 01:35:11,296
Xiao Yan and the baby
are coming with me.

955
01:35:11,340 --> 01:35:14,332
You'll never see them again!

956
01:35:14,377 --> 01:35:18,609
I'll cut off your dick
and feed it to the pigs!

957
01:35:18,648 --> 01:35:21,310
Let's get Xiao Yan and the baby
out of here!

958
01:35:23,953 --> 01:35:25,978
Named your baby yet?

959
01:35:29,125 --> 01:35:31,616
His horoscope's bad?

960
01:35:35,031 --> 01:35:37,124
Why was Yun-Yun there?

961
01:35:38,935 --> 01:35:41,301
It was a setup.

962
01:35:42,705 --> 01:35:46,334
You've been seeing her?

963
01:35:46,375 --> 01:35:48,707
Not exactly.

964
01:35:51,681 --> 01:35:54,514
Xiao Yan's been pregnant.

965
01:35:54,550 --> 01:35:57,542
Yun-Yun and l
go back a long way.

966
01:36:01,991 --> 01:36:06,655
I've helped her out a little,
out of courtesy.

967
01:36:36,459 --> 01:36:40,486
Paging NJ Jian,
you have a visitor!

968
01:36:41,530 --> 01:36:43,521
How courteous.

969
01:36:46,102 --> 01:36:49,094
You're one lucky guy.

970
01:36:49,138 --> 01:36:52,403
A nice home and a colorful life!

971
01:36:52,441 --> 01:36:56,468
I'll take a shower.
Help yourself to a drink.

972
01:36:56,512 --> 01:37:00,346
Give me a break.
I have to drive home.

973
01:37:00,383 --> 01:37:04,479
Sleep it off.
Start afresh tomorrow.

974
01:37:04,520 --> 01:37:06,249
I wish!

975
01:37:06,289 --> 01:37:07,449
Go to bed.

976
01:37:07,490 --> 01:37:09,117
A bad day's over.

977
01:37:10,526 --> 01:37:12,323
It's all over.

978
01:37:14,430 --> 01:37:16,193
It's all over.

979
01:37:30,179 --> 01:37:32,079
It's all over.

980
01:37:52,835 --> 01:37:55,360
Fuck!

981
01:37:55,404 --> 01:37:57,634
Look at this mess!

982
01:38:09,485 --> 01:38:11,077
Thanks.

983
01:38:21,897 --> 01:38:24,957
All these empty bottles,
damn it.

984
01:38:26,035 --> 01:38:27,696
A-Di!

985
01:38:34,844 --> 01:38:38,439
Can't you answer
while you're running your bath?

986
01:38:38,481 --> 01:38:41,609
Still mad at me, you bastard?

987
01:38:46,822 --> 01:38:50,588
What are you doing in there?
I smell gas!

988
01:38:58,367 --> 01:39:00,733
What happened?

989
01:39:00,770 --> 01:39:02,829
Open the door!

990
01:39:06,575 --> 01:39:09,305
Telephone!
Where's the damn phone?

991
01:39:14,617 --> 01:39:17,745
Open the door, A-Di!

992
01:39:34,670 --> 01:39:36,934
What were you doing?

993
01:39:36,972 --> 01:39:39,805
Why did you close the window?

994
01:39:47,616 --> 01:39:50,551
What were you doing?

995
01:39:50,586 --> 01:39:53,521
Why didn't you open the window?

996
01:39:54,857 --> 01:39:57,655
Why was the window closed?

997
01:40:07,303 --> 01:40:10,363
Why didn't you open it?

998
01:40:13,442 --> 01:40:16,002
Why didn't you open it?

999
01:40:24,820 --> 01:40:28,881
I won't fight with you again.

1000
01:40:34,864 --> 01:40:36,832
What happened?

1001
01:40:36,866 --> 01:40:39,096
You seemed fine last night.

1002
01:40:39,135 --> 01:40:41,365
Don't scare me.

1003
01:40:41,403 --> 01:40:43,496
I'm fine.

1004
01:40:43,539 --> 01:40:45,666
What did I do?

1005
01:40:45,708 --> 01:40:48,108
I just took a bath.

1006
01:40:48,144 --> 01:40:50,044
Go ask the gas company.

1007
01:40:51,881 --> 01:40:53,940
Check my pager for me.

1008
01:40:53,983 --> 01:40:56,213
What a time to page me.

1009
01:41:00,256 --> 01:41:03,419
2773-7557.

1010
01:41:03,459 --> 01:41:06,656
That's my office!
Why are they paging you?

1011
01:41:06,695 --> 01:41:11,564
I tried all your numbers!
Lucky we had his pager number.

1012
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:13,431
What's the rush?

1013
01:41:13,469 --> 01:41:16,404
We have serious interest
from this guy.

1014
01:41:16,438 --> 01:41:18,565
But he gives us only one hour.

1015
01:41:18,607 --> 01:41:21,599
What guy? Interested in what?

1016
01:41:21,644 --> 01:41:22,770
Get in.

1017
01:41:22,811 --> 01:41:25,405
You need an "honest-looking" guy
again, right?

1018
01:41:25,447 --> 01:41:28,905
Why come to me?
You've sewn it up!

1019
01:41:28,951 --> 01:41:30,509
Get on board.

1020
01:41:30,553 --> 01:41:33,579
Mind if I don't have a ticket?

1021
01:41:33,622 --> 01:41:36,887
Boss Huang knows all about Ota.

1022
01:41:36,926 --> 01:41:38,723
You've signed with him...

1023
01:41:38,761 --> 01:41:41,423
and Boss Huang
wants in at whatever price.

1024
01:41:41,463 --> 01:41:44,091
Today,
we'll finalize the details.

1025
01:41:44,133 --> 01:41:48,627
NJ is Ota-san's very old friend!
Right, NJ?

1026
01:41:48,671 --> 01:41:51,663
Boss Huang was drinking
with the President all night.

1027
01:41:51,707 --> 01:41:54,369
He's resting now.
Time is tight.

1028
01:41:54,410 --> 01:41:56,435
Wait here a moment.

1029
01:42:02,685 --> 01:42:05,950
Fly to Tokyo and sign
with Ota right away!

1030
01:42:05,988 --> 01:42:08,684
Get on the next flight.

1031
01:42:10,960 --> 01:42:14,987
Huang used to run game arcades.

1032
01:42:15,030 --> 01:42:17,965
He knows Ota's stuff well.

1033
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:23,336
As a legislator, he now supports
women's rights and quotas.

1034
01:42:23,372 --> 01:42:25,431
Is this gonna make money?

1035
01:42:30,479 --> 01:42:33,039
This is a long weekend in Japan.

1036
01:42:33,082 --> 01:42:38,384
The noon flight is full.
You're wait-listed.

1037
01:42:38,420 --> 01:42:42,413
Shall I book a later flight?
You'd get in quite late.

1038
01:42:42,458 --> 01:42:44,187
Why not? Go ahead.

1039
01:42:48,897 --> 01:42:53,493
International call on line two.
This person has called before.

1040
01:43:02,611 --> 01:43:05,705
I was away,
running around on business.

1041
01:43:05,748 --> 01:43:08,717
I'll be in Tokyo tomorrow.

1042
01:43:08,751 --> 01:43:10,480
Are you sure?

1043
01:43:12,454 --> 01:43:14,854
Hang on, I'll check.

1044
01:43:16,225 --> 01:43:18,318
Which hotel am I in?

1045
01:43:35,044 --> 01:43:38,207
I won't be your go-between!

1046
01:43:38,247 --> 01:43:42,206
Why come to me again?
What did I say last time?

1047
01:43:42,251 --> 01:43:44,151
This is for you, Ting-Ting.

1048
01:44:15,651 --> 01:44:19,280
I have to go to Tokyo tomorrow.

1049
01:44:19,321 --> 01:44:23,485
The nurse will come in
every day, but...

1050
01:44:23,525 --> 01:44:26,756
You'll be on your own, OK?

1051
01:45:47,943 --> 01:45:50,537
You got here so quickly!

1052
01:45:50,579 --> 01:45:54,310
So many flights every day
from Chicago to Tokyo.

1053
01:46:40,529 --> 01:46:44,056
Shall we visit
your father's school?

1054
01:46:53,942 --> 01:46:56,410
We'll change
from the green line to...

1055
01:46:56,445 --> 01:46:58,504
the blue.

1056
01:47:00,549 --> 01:47:02,483
That's the exit.

1057
01:47:02,518 --> 01:47:05,487
But the map says this way.

1058
01:47:05,521 --> 01:47:06,783
No, that's the way out.

1059
01:47:06,822 --> 01:47:09,814
The blue line is this way.
That's the Chuo line.

1060
01:47:17,165 --> 01:47:21,033
This reminds me
of our first date.

1061
01:47:21,069 --> 01:47:26,371
I was so nervous,
I had the hiccups, remember?

1062
01:47:26,408 --> 01:47:29,502
I've had hiccups since I was
a kid whenever I'm nervous.

1063
01:47:29,545 --> 01:47:35,313
I was too nervous to ask why!

1064
01:47:35,350 --> 01:47:39,286
You were too nervous to breathe!

1065
01:47:39,321 --> 01:47:41,915
I sweat when I'm nervous,
my palms...

1066
01:47:41,957 --> 01:47:44,619
even my feet!

1067
01:47:55,437 --> 01:47:57,302
Excuse me.

1068
01:47:57,339 --> 01:47:58,829
Excuse me.

1069
01:47:58,874 --> 01:48:00,136
Excuse me.

1070
01:48:49,057 --> 01:48:52,720
Rodney and l
don't have children...

1071
01:48:52,761 --> 01:48:55,924
but he loves kids.

1072
01:48:55,964 --> 01:48:58,489
He's on business a lot.

1073
01:48:58,533 --> 01:49:02,492
We're thinking of adopting
so I'll have company.

1074
01:49:02,537 --> 01:49:05,665
-And you?
-Two.

1075
01:49:05,707 --> 01:49:08,676
A girl in high school
and a boy of eight.

1076
01:49:08,710 --> 01:49:10,473
I love my daughter.

1077
01:49:10,512 --> 01:49:13,174
She's growing into a woman.
I get jealous...

1078
01:49:13,215 --> 01:49:17,151
knowing eventually
she'll be with someone else.

1079
01:49:17,185 --> 01:49:21,053
My son?
I want to be his friend...

1080
01:49:21,089 --> 01:49:23,956
The relationship I always wanted
with my father.

1081
01:49:23,992 --> 01:49:25,619
What time is it?

1082
01:49:26,662 --> 01:49:28,061
Nine.

1083
01:49:30,565 --> 01:49:35,901
It's almost ten.
That's eight a.m. in Chicago.

1084
01:49:35,937 --> 01:49:38,838
Nine p.m. in Taipei.

1085
01:49:38,874 --> 01:49:41,365
Let's find a place
for the night.

1086
01:49:42,544 --> 01:49:47,880
Look, this is like
the crossing near our school.

1087
01:49:49,785 --> 01:49:52,583
That's gone now.

1088
01:49:52,621 --> 01:49:55,522
The first time
I held your hand...

1089
01:49:55,557 --> 01:49:59,789
We were at a railroad crossing,
going to the movies.

1090
01:49:59,828 --> 01:50:03,320
I reached for you,
ashamed of my sweaty palm...

1091
01:50:06,468 --> 01:50:08,902
Now I'm holding
your hand again.

1092
01:50:13,108 --> 01:50:16,874
Only it's a different place...

1093
01:50:16,912 --> 01:50:19,938
A different time...

1094
01:50:19,981 --> 01:50:21,881
A different age...

1095
01:50:21,917 --> 01:50:24,784
But the same sweaty palm.

1096
01:50:28,824 --> 01:50:31,622
Did you like the movie?

1097
01:50:31,660 --> 01:50:33,491
A bit too serious.

1098
01:50:33,528 --> 01:50:36,088
You prefer comedies?

1099
01:50:36,131 --> 01:50:40,295
Not really,
but it didn't have to be so sad.

1100
01:50:40,335 --> 01:50:44,431
Life is a mixture
of sad and happy things.

1101
01:50:44,473 --> 01:50:48,000
Movies are so lifelike.
That's why we love them.

1102
01:50:48,043 --> 01:50:53,140
Then who needs movies?
Just stay home and live life!

1103
01:50:53,181 --> 01:50:56,048
My uncle says...

1104
01:50:56,084 --> 01:51:00,578
"We live three times as long
since man invented movies."

1105
01:51:00,622 --> 01:51:02,522
How can that be?

1106
01:51:02,557 --> 01:51:07,620
It means movies give us twice
what we get from daily life.

1107
01:51:07,662 --> 01:51:09,823
For example, murder.

1108
01:51:09,865 --> 01:51:12,891
We never killed anyone,
be we all know...

1109
01:51:12,934 --> 01:51:15,095
what it's like to kill.

1110
01:51:15,137 --> 01:51:17,799
That's what we get
from the movies.

1111
01:51:17,839 --> 01:51:19,636
What good is it to me?

1112
01:51:19,674 --> 01:51:22,404
If life's so horrible,
why live at all?

1113
01:51:22,444 --> 01:51:25,538
If we're nice to people,
they'll be nice back.

1114
01:51:25,580 --> 01:51:27,844
Who needs to kill anybody?

1115
01:51:27,883 --> 01:51:30,044
It's only one example.

1116
01:51:30,085 --> 01:51:32,349
There are other things.

1117
01:51:32,387 --> 01:51:34,287
Like he also said...

1118
01:51:34,322 --> 01:51:35,721
"There's no cloud...

1119
01:51:35,757 --> 01:51:37,190
"no tree...

1120
01:51:37,225 --> 01:51:39,420
"that isn't beautiful...

1121
01:51:39,461 --> 01:51:42,521
"so we should be, too."

1122
01:51:42,564 --> 01:51:45,397
I found that very touching.

1123
01:51:45,433 --> 01:51:47,594
It changed me in many ways.

1124
01:51:48,870 --> 01:51:51,964
You make it sound tragic!

1125
01:51:52,007 --> 01:51:55,704
Shouldn't it sound cheerful?

1126
01:52:00,148 --> 01:52:03,777
Later I married
and had a child...

1127
01:52:03,819 --> 01:52:06,014
didn't you hear?

1128
01:52:07,989 --> 01:52:11,117
But I divorced within a year.

1129
01:52:11,159 --> 01:52:15,255
I went to study in Seattle,
married a Chinese-American.

1130
01:52:19,134 --> 01:52:22,103
I had to run away.

1131
01:52:24,806 --> 01:52:27,274
That day...

1132
01:52:27,309 --> 01:52:30,574
I waited and waited.

1133
01:52:30,612 --> 01:52:34,070
You never showed up.

1134
01:52:34,115 --> 01:52:37,573
I waited because I knew...

1135
01:52:37,619 --> 01:52:40,986
I'd be ruined
if I didn't see you.

1136
01:52:41,022 --> 01:52:45,982
I wouldn't know how to live on!
I'd fall apart!

1137
01:52:46,027 --> 01:52:50,430
Waiting was my only chance.

1138
01:52:51,800 --> 01:52:54,394
I waited for one day.

1139
01:52:54,436 --> 01:52:58,372
Then for another day.

1140
01:52:58,406 --> 01:53:02,968
I asked friends to find you.
There was no response.

1141
01:53:03,011 --> 01:53:05,639
You just vanished.

1142
01:53:10,218 --> 01:53:12,448
I left without a word.

1143
01:53:12,487 --> 01:53:17,390
Aside from silly excuses,
I had nothing to say.

1144
01:53:17,425 --> 01:53:20,451
I was so angry!

1145
01:53:20,495 --> 01:53:23,953
You pushed me
to become an engineer.

1146
01:53:23,999 --> 01:53:28,732
Did you ever ask what I wanted?

1147
01:53:28,770 --> 01:53:34,231
You and my parents were so happy
the day I graduated.

1148
01:53:34,276 --> 01:53:36,767
But me? I was so sad.

1149
01:53:38,246 --> 01:53:41,511
You can't run
someone else's life...

1150
01:53:41,549 --> 01:53:44,985
dictate how he spends
his days...

1151
01:53:45,020 --> 01:53:46,954
That's sad, you know?

1152
01:53:46,988 --> 01:53:50,014
And the one doing it
was the one I loved most!

1153
01:53:53,395 --> 01:53:55,295
So...

1154
01:53:55,330 --> 01:53:59,494
Do you know
how that hurt inside?

1155
01:53:59,534 --> 01:54:01,502
Do you?

1156
01:54:07,909 --> 01:54:10,469
How funny.

1157
01:54:10,512 --> 01:54:15,211
I'm doing exactly
what you wanted me to do.

1158
01:54:15,250 --> 01:54:20,483
And you have a better life
than I could ever give you.

1159
01:54:20,522 --> 01:54:22,786
You were so naive.

1160
01:54:22,824 --> 01:54:25,657
I thought we'd end up penniless.

1161
01:54:25,694 --> 01:54:29,186
What? You were always after me!

1162
01:54:29,230 --> 01:54:30,925
Nonsense!

1163
01:54:30,966 --> 01:54:34,424
You were just standing there
looking at me.

1164
01:54:34,469 --> 01:54:38,064
I couldn't stand it any longer.

1165
01:54:38,106 --> 01:54:40,768
Remember what I said?

1166
01:54:40,809 --> 01:54:46,338
"lf you want to talk to me,
get a move on!"

1167
01:54:47,415 --> 01:54:49,679
Why did you...

1168
01:54:49,718 --> 01:54:54,178
suddenly fall for me
in high school?

1169
01:54:54,222 --> 01:54:57,487
It was much earlier.

1170
01:54:57,525 --> 01:54:59,652
In primary school.

1171
01:54:59,694 --> 01:55:02,686
That's when it all started.

1172
01:55:02,731 --> 01:55:08,431
Strange, I just wanted
to see you every day.

1173
01:55:08,470 --> 01:55:12,236
If I missed seeing you,
I'd feel bad all day.

1174
01:55:13,875 --> 01:55:17,436
That's why you gawped.

1175
01:55:17,479 --> 01:55:23,714
We all wore uniforms,
but yours looked different.

1176
01:55:25,387 --> 01:55:27,548
In what way?

1177
01:55:27,589 --> 01:55:29,352
A very special way.

1178
01:57:04,652 --> 01:57:08,952
Yang-Yang...

1179
01:57:08,990 --> 01:57:10,958
You've been in there
a long time.

1180
01:57:13,128 --> 01:57:16,586
What are you doing?

1181
01:57:19,968 --> 01:57:21,936
Say something!

1182
01:57:21,970 --> 01:57:24,370
Why don't you answer?

1183
01:57:24,405 --> 01:57:26,737
Hurry up! Come out!

1184
01:57:28,309 --> 01:57:32,143
What are you doing?

1185
01:57:34,549 --> 01:57:39,145
What are you playing with?

1186
01:57:40,188 --> 01:57:43,555
Did you fall into the toilet?

1187
01:57:45,126 --> 01:57:48,027
What are you doing in there?

1188
01:57:51,399 --> 01:57:53,731
May I use your mother's
bathroom?

1189
01:57:53,768 --> 01:57:55,599
Of course.

1190
01:58:05,713 --> 01:58:08,341
That'll be from the hospital.

1191
01:58:08,383 --> 01:58:10,317
I'll get it.

1192
01:58:38,012 --> 01:58:40,412
Tell me the truth.

1193
01:58:44,986 --> 01:58:46,578
What?

1194
01:58:58,766 --> 01:59:01,200
Are you seeing Fatty?

1195
01:59:08,610 --> 01:59:10,475
No...

1196
01:59:10,511 --> 01:59:12,672
We're just friends.

1197
02:01:16,304 --> 02:01:18,966
Don't be like this, Ting-Ting.

1198
02:01:21,976 --> 02:01:25,571
Of course she spoke to me, too.

1199
02:01:29,250 --> 02:01:32,845
You have known her a long time.
That's how she is.

1200
02:01:32,887 --> 02:01:34,980
You should know by now.

1201
02:01:46,701 --> 02:01:49,636
What is she to you now?

1202
02:01:51,205 --> 02:01:53,469
Nothing.

1203
02:02:01,883 --> 02:02:04,249
In my heart...

1204
02:02:08,790 --> 02:02:10,849
there's only you.

1205
02:02:20,067 --> 02:02:22,262
Is that true?

1206
02:02:24,305 --> 02:02:26,535
You don't believe me?

1207
02:04:44,245 --> 02:04:46,475
It's...

1208
02:04:50,718 --> 02:04:52,743
not right.

1209
02:05:35,496 --> 02:05:38,397
One of my aunts
got married here.

1210
02:05:38,432 --> 02:05:39,922
Which one?

1211
02:05:39,967 --> 02:05:41,298
It was that summer.

1212
02:05:41,335 --> 02:05:45,431
They still dance the twist
around here!

1213
02:05:45,473 --> 02:05:47,202
"Good morning."

1214
02:05:50,277 --> 02:05:54,338
Good morning?
It's almost bedtime!

1215
02:05:54,382 --> 02:05:57,215
It's the only Japanese word
I know!

1216
02:06:29,016 --> 02:06:31,849
The clerk
gave you a strange look...

1217
02:06:31,886 --> 02:06:34,753
when he handed you two keys.

1218
02:06:34,789 --> 02:06:37,986
Who sleeps
in separate rooms these days?

1219
02:06:38,025 --> 02:06:41,119
To sleep with someone
means nothing now.

1220
02:06:41,162 --> 02:06:43,027
You're off again.

1221
02:06:43,064 --> 02:06:44,497
But it's true!

1222
02:06:44,532 --> 02:06:47,592
You dragged me to a hotel first,
remember?

1223
02:06:47,635 --> 02:06:51,036
I was scared, I ran off!

1224
02:06:51,072 --> 02:06:56,510
I used to think you'd vanish
if I just looked away.

1225
02:06:56,544 --> 02:06:59,638
If you gave yourself to me...

1226
02:06:59,680 --> 02:07:03,946
you could always hold me
to account for it later, right?

1227
02:07:05,586 --> 02:07:07,713
Not at all.

1228
02:07:08,989 --> 02:07:11,048
But when you left the room...

1229
02:07:12,727 --> 02:07:15,628
I knew you didn't love me
anymore.

1230
02:07:20,501 --> 02:07:22,992
You still feel that way now?

1231
02:08:13,087 --> 02:08:14,884
You know how I felt...

1232
02:08:14,922 --> 02:08:19,154
when you turned away just now?

1233
02:08:19,193 --> 02:08:23,960
It felt as if l'd
never see you again!

1234
02:08:23,998 --> 02:08:26,660
I don't want to go on like this.

1235
02:08:27,868 --> 02:08:30,336
I don't want to go on like this.

1236
02:08:34,575 --> 02:08:38,909
I have everything.
What am I afraid of?

1237
02:08:40,181 --> 02:08:42,012
If I divorced Rodney...

1238
02:08:42,049 --> 02:08:45,382
I'd be well off for the rest
of my life.

1239
02:08:46,921 --> 02:08:49,788
We could start over.
How about it?

1240
02:08:52,760 --> 02:08:56,958
I was too insecure.
It was my fault.

1241
02:08:58,132 --> 02:09:01,727
Now I have nothing to fear.

1242
02:09:03,404 --> 02:09:05,702
Let's start a new life,
shall we?

1243
02:09:05,739 --> 02:09:08,230
You're tired, Sherry.

1244
02:09:08,275 --> 02:09:10,436
Don't change the subject!

1245
02:09:10,477 --> 02:09:12,536
You're scared, right?

1246
02:09:12,580 --> 02:09:14,639
You never loved me!

1247
02:09:14,682 --> 02:09:16,445
Admit it!

1248
02:09:16,483 --> 02:09:18,246
Sherry!

1249
02:09:25,993 --> 02:09:30,828
Why do I behave like this
whenever I'm with you?

1250
02:09:32,299 --> 02:09:34,597
Why do I always do that?

1251
02:09:34,635 --> 02:09:37,433
I'm sorry.

1252
02:09:37,471 --> 02:09:40,929
Why do I always
make the same mistakes...

1253
02:09:40,975 --> 02:09:44,376
when I know I'll regret them
for the rest of my life?

1254
02:09:53,187 --> 02:09:55,712
Don't feel sorry.

1255
02:09:55,756 --> 02:09:58,850
Who understands you
better than I do?

1256
02:10:00,427 --> 02:10:02,759
Who understands you
better than I do?

1257
02:10:08,035 --> 02:10:10,367
I think of you...

1258
02:10:11,372 --> 02:10:14,500
every day of my life, you know?

1259
02:10:20,648 --> 02:10:22,047
Think?

1260
02:10:23,250 --> 02:10:25,343
Think...

1261
02:10:25,386 --> 02:10:28,822
We all need time to think.

1262
02:10:28,856 --> 02:10:30,983
Carefully think.

1263
02:10:35,996 --> 02:10:39,932
Come on.

1264
02:10:39,967 --> 02:10:43,061
This is my business trip.

1265
02:10:43,103 --> 02:10:46,402
You've handed me
a huge workload.

1266
02:10:46,440 --> 02:10:49,000
It'll take several trips
to deal with.

1267
02:10:50,577 --> 02:10:54,069
Give me a break.
This is a big job.

1268
02:12:44,158 --> 02:12:46,183
I'm so tired.

1269
02:12:47,528 --> 02:12:51,965
I have to crash.

1270
02:12:51,999 --> 02:12:54,729
I'll pick you up for breakfast.

1271
02:13:00,474 --> 02:13:04,467
Have a good meeting tonight.

1272
02:13:14,688 --> 02:13:16,883
Sherry...

1273
02:13:20,961 --> 02:13:23,691
I never loved anyone else.

1274
02:14:47,948 --> 02:14:53,511
Can you bring me
a pack of cards?

1275
02:14:53,554 --> 02:14:59,117
Yes, but Morita-san
prohibits gambling here, sir.

1276
02:14:59,159 --> 02:15:03,357
I won't gamble.
Morita-san knows.

1277
02:15:03,397 --> 02:15:05,365
Then why do you need them?

1278
02:15:05,399 --> 02:15:07,128
Two warm pots of sake.

1279
02:15:07,167 --> 02:15:08,657
Yes, sir.

1280
02:18:58,465 --> 02:19:01,229
You're not gambling, are you?

1281
02:19:05,338 --> 02:19:07,704
Who won?

1282
02:19:33,066 --> 02:19:35,626
I tried to reach you
all day yesterday.

1283
02:19:35,669 --> 02:19:38,035
Relax, I talked to Mr. Ota.

1284
02:19:38,071 --> 02:19:41,040
Listen, we've signed with Ato.

1285
02:19:41,074 --> 02:19:44,100
That's what I wanted
to tell you yesterday.

1286
02:19:44,144 --> 02:19:47,807
Ato? Why?
I thought Boss Huang--

1287
02:19:47,848 --> 02:19:52,683
He's into quota-representation
for women, I told you.

1288
02:19:52,719 --> 02:19:54,778
And Ato is a woman?

1289
02:19:54,821 --> 02:19:57,051
A 34E-cup!

1290
02:19:58,358 --> 02:20:01,850
Make an excuse
and come back home.

1291
02:20:07,934 --> 02:20:11,335
What do you say, NJ?

1292
02:20:11,371 --> 02:20:13,396
Nothing! I get it!

1293
02:20:39,332 --> 02:20:41,630
NJ, what's wrong?

1294
02:20:41,668 --> 02:20:44,899
Don't get emotional.
This solves our problems.

1295
02:20:44,938 --> 02:20:49,602
We should celebrate!
We didn't promise Ota anything.

1296
02:20:49,643 --> 02:20:51,338
You...

1297
02:20:51,378 --> 02:20:53,471
You know that hurts!

1298
02:20:53,513 --> 02:20:55,981
What hurts?

1299
02:20:56,016 --> 02:20:59,508
Mr. Ota is a good man!
Where's our dignity?

1300
02:20:59,553 --> 02:21:02,579
What's that got to do
with business?

1301
02:22:56,369 --> 02:22:58,132
I'll ride pillion!

1302
02:23:15,522 --> 02:23:17,854
I just got back.

1303
02:23:19,059 --> 02:23:21,687
Where's my cup? Can't find it.

1304
02:28:02,842 --> 02:28:07,176
Fatty, don't feel this way
because of me.

1305
02:28:07,213 --> 02:28:12,014
It's OK. We can still
be friends. I'm still--

1306
02:28:12,051 --> 02:28:14,451
Still what?

1307
02:28:14,487 --> 02:28:16,751
Still cheerful, right?

1308
02:28:17,857 --> 02:28:22,089
It's all crap!
Life's not like your dreams!

1309
02:28:23,429 --> 02:28:26,865
If it was, you wouldn't need
those love stories...

1310
02:28:26,899 --> 02:28:29,094
to kid yourself!

1311
02:28:29,135 --> 02:28:32,730
Get lost!

1312
02:28:33,740 --> 02:28:37,699
Never bug me again!

1313
02:28:37,744 --> 02:28:40,076
Stay away from me!

1314
02:28:44,717 --> 02:28:48,380
Believe it, these things happen!

1315
02:28:48,421 --> 02:28:53,859
When the stars are in alignment,
the gods smile on us!

1316
02:28:53,893 --> 02:28:57,294
How old is hi-tech?
Twenty years?

1317
02:28:57,330 --> 02:29:00,595
Horoscopes are thousands
of years old!

1318
02:29:02,368 --> 02:29:04,495
Ting-Ting must be back.

1319
02:29:04,537 --> 02:29:06,903
Here's the bank draft.

1320
02:29:06,939 --> 02:29:10,466
That clears my debt.

1321
02:29:11,511 --> 02:29:15,607
That bastard Piggy
is on the run in China!

1322
02:29:15,648 --> 02:29:18,811
So I rushed to his place.

1323
02:29:18,851 --> 02:29:22,014
It was crawling with cops!

1324
02:29:22,055 --> 02:29:25,718
The place was empty
and sealed off!

1325
02:29:25,758 --> 02:29:27,817
So I found this one cop.

1326
02:29:27,860 --> 02:29:30,385
Talked him into letting me in.

1327
02:29:30,430 --> 02:29:35,868
Shit, the creditors
had cleared the place out!

1328
02:29:35,902 --> 02:29:38,427
Only junk left lying around.

1329
02:29:38,471 --> 02:29:41,770
Still, I found
this funny piece of rock.

1330
02:29:41,808 --> 02:29:44,402
Nobody had seen what it was!

1331
02:29:44,444 --> 02:29:47,777
How did you get so wet?
Is it raining so hard?

1332
02:29:47,814 --> 02:29:50,476
Get out of those wet clothes.

1333
02:29:50,516 --> 02:29:53,485
I had it valued,
and the guy's eyes lit up.

1334
02:29:53,519 --> 02:29:56,488
It was antique jade!

1335
02:29:56,522 --> 02:29:59,457
An 8,000-year-old
national treasure!

1336
02:29:59,492 --> 02:30:02,359
I kept my cool.

1337
02:30:06,299 --> 02:30:09,462
I asked for what Piggy owed me.

1338
02:30:09,502 --> 02:30:11,732
The guy wrote out a check
on the spot!

1339
02:30:11,771 --> 02:30:14,467
It must have been worth
a lot more.

1340
02:30:14,507 --> 02:30:18,136
We shouldn't be too greedy!

1341
02:30:20,046 --> 02:30:21,741
Get out of bed!

1342
02:30:21,781 --> 02:30:24,978
Just lying there
will make you sick!

1343
02:30:25,017 --> 02:30:28,475
I'll pick you up
at seven tomorrow.

1344
02:30:28,521 --> 02:30:33,515
Stick with me, your horoscope
will improve no end!

1345
02:30:33,559 --> 02:30:36,221
What's this? For me?

1346
02:30:38,698 --> 02:30:40,859
This is me!

1347
02:30:40,900 --> 02:30:43,266
The back of my head!

1348
02:30:43,302 --> 02:30:46,362
What's this for?

1349
02:30:46,405 --> 02:30:50,341
You can't see it yourself,
so I help you.

1350
02:30:50,376 --> 02:30:52,503
So that's why!

1351
02:30:52,545 --> 02:30:54,479
That's why what?

1352
02:31:51,003 --> 02:31:54,131
I've done nothing bad.

1353
02:31:59,779 --> 02:32:02,805
Why is it so unfair?

1354
02:32:14,961 --> 02:32:19,557
Unless...
you haven't forgiven me.

1355
02:32:28,908 --> 02:32:33,345
Why don't you wake up?

1356
02:32:39,185 --> 02:32:42,120
Please wake up, will you?

1357
02:33:06,679 --> 02:33:09,944
Nobody's home.
His daughter must be at school.

1358
02:33:09,982 --> 02:33:12,712
-Which school?
-First Girls' High.

1359
02:33:12,752 --> 02:33:15,721
I'll send a policewoman there.

1360
02:33:16,889 --> 02:33:20,655
Mr. Jian is usually home
these days.

1361
02:33:44,417 --> 02:33:47,477
This front passed us
yesterday afternoon.

1362
02:33:47,520 --> 02:33:52,514
We should now have clear
weather until Thursday.

1363
02:33:52,558 --> 02:33:55,391
Next up, City News.

1364
02:33:55,428 --> 02:33:58,454
There was a murder this morning.

1365
02:33:58,497 --> 02:34:01,694
It happened in
the Da-An district of Taipei.

1366
02:34:01,734 --> 02:34:04,362
The suspect is a teenager.

1367
02:34:04,403 --> 02:34:07,497
We cross to the murder site
for a report.

1368
02:34:07,540 --> 02:34:10,839
This is the suspect.
Nicknamed Fatty, he's a pupil...

1369
02:34:10,876 --> 02:34:13,344
at a posh school.

1370
02:34:13,379 --> 02:34:17,008
The victim was an English
teacher named Chen Lihua.

1371
02:34:17,049 --> 02:34:18,949
We are reliably informed...

1372
02:34:18,984 --> 02:34:21,646
the suspect's girlfriend...

1373
02:34:21,687 --> 02:34:27,250
had a sexual relationship
with the victim.

1374
02:34:27,293 --> 02:34:29,420
The police confirm the victim...

1375
02:34:29,462 --> 02:34:32,863
was also involved
with the girl's mother.

1376
02:34:32,898 --> 02:34:34,866
It complicates the case.

1377
02:34:34,900 --> 02:34:36,527
The mother works...

1378
02:34:36,569 --> 02:34:40,528
for a well-known American bank.

1379
02:34:40,573 --> 02:34:43,337
She had no comment today.

1380
02:34:43,376 --> 02:34:46,004
The security guard
recalls the suspect...

1381
02:34:46,045 --> 02:34:48,605
was seen loitering
near the building yesterday.

1382
02:34:48,647 --> 02:34:53,380
As the victim left the building
early this morning...

1383
02:34:53,419 --> 02:34:57,116
the suspect took a knife from
his satchel and stabbed him.

1384
02:34:57,156 --> 02:35:00,489
It was reportedly
a grisly scene.

1385
02:37:00,746 --> 02:37:04,876
I thought it was the nurse.

1386
02:37:04,917 --> 02:37:08,216
It's 2:30. She's still not here.

1387
02:37:23,502 --> 02:37:27,802
I was at the police station.

1388
02:37:30,476 --> 02:37:33,707
I can't face going back
to school.

1389
02:38:10,783 --> 02:38:13,547
I haven't slept for so long.

1390
02:38:15,788 --> 02:38:18,222
I'm so tired, Grandma.

1391
02:38:23,796 --> 02:38:26,287
Now...

1392
02:38:26,332 --> 02:38:28,562
you've forgiven me...

1393
02:38:30,102 --> 02:38:32,400
I can sleep.

1394
02:38:48,020 --> 02:38:49,954
Grandma...

1395
02:38:52,324 --> 02:38:56,920
Why is the world so different
from what we thought it was?

1396
02:39:01,533 --> 02:39:04,001
Now that you're awake...

1397
02:39:05,170 --> 02:39:07,297
and see it again...

1398
02:39:11,543 --> 02:39:14,444
has it changed at all?

1399
02:39:21,253 --> 02:39:23,084
Now...

1400
02:39:26,392 --> 02:39:28,792
I close my eyes...

1401
02:39:32,898 --> 02:39:35,298
the world I see...

1402
02:39:39,405 --> 02:39:41,839
is so beautiful.

1403
02:39:59,491 --> 02:40:03,689
Migo, this isn't a joke.

1404
02:40:06,365 --> 02:40:09,232
Why would I kid you?

1405
02:40:16,208 --> 02:40:18,676
Yes, Migo.

1406
02:40:18,711 --> 02:40:20,542
I'm not kidding.

1407
02:40:29,254 --> 02:40:31,848
Migo...

1408
02:40:31,890 --> 02:40:34,017
calm down!

1409
02:40:37,329 --> 02:40:40,992
I feel it's my fault.

1410
02:40:41,033 --> 02:40:48,530
If I'd come earlier,
this might not have happened.

1411
02:40:49,775 --> 02:40:52,073
It's all my fault.

1412
02:40:57,449 --> 02:40:59,610
Don't be so upset.

1413
02:41:14,600 --> 02:41:20,232
It's my mother's funeral.
Money is not a problem.

1414
02:41:23,909 --> 02:41:29,040
Unfortunately,
I was out all day today.

1415
02:41:30,582 --> 02:41:33,278
It must have been
a peaceful end.

1416
02:41:34,620 --> 02:41:38,750
Even if someone were home,
they wouldn't have noticed.

1417
02:41:41,727 --> 02:41:45,094
Listen, stay in your room, OK?
Good boy.

1418
02:41:54,773 --> 02:42:01,201
It was about 3 hours ago,
around 2:30 p.m.

1419
02:42:49,561 --> 02:42:52,997
Nothing's changed here.

1420
02:42:53,031 --> 02:42:57,229
The kids are both fine.

1421
02:42:59,938 --> 02:43:03,601
How was it up the mountain?

1422
02:43:06,845 --> 02:43:08,710
It was fine.

1423
02:43:15,454 --> 02:43:22,883
Actually,
it was much the same...

1424
02:43:24,196 --> 02:43:26,289
Just like...

1425
02:43:26,331 --> 02:43:29,095
talking to Mother.

1426
02:43:30,969 --> 02:43:35,565
But with the roles reversed.

1427
02:43:35,607 --> 02:43:40,772
I was like Mother,
they were like me.

1428
02:43:40,812 --> 02:43:46,682
They took turns to talk to me,
the same things every time.

1429
02:43:48,854 --> 02:43:51,220
Several times a day.

1430
02:44:03,135 --> 02:44:07,401
I've come to realize...

1431
02:44:09,341 --> 02:44:11,741
things aren't really
so complicated.

1432
02:44:16,949 --> 02:44:19,509
Why did they ever seem so?

1433
02:44:19,551 --> 02:44:21,212
Right.

1434
02:44:29,995 --> 02:44:32,862
How can I say this?

1435
02:44:32,898 --> 02:44:34,695
While you were away...

1436
02:44:34,733 --> 02:44:38,499
I had a chance to relive
part of my youth.

1437
02:44:40,005 --> 02:44:42,132
My first thought...

1438
02:44:42,174 --> 02:44:44,972
was that I could...

1439
02:44:45,010 --> 02:44:47,672
make things turn out
differently.

1440
02:44:47,713 --> 02:44:49,374
But...

1441
02:44:51,016 --> 02:44:54,713
they turned out the same,
or not much different.

1442
02:44:58,523 --> 02:45:00,787
I suddenly realized that...

1443
02:45:02,327 --> 02:45:05,057
even if I was given
a second chance...

1444
02:45:07,032 --> 02:45:09,159
I wouldn't need it.

1445
02:45:10,569 --> 02:45:12,730
I really wouldn't.

1446
02:46:18,003 --> 02:46:21,495
Why did you have to leave us?

1447
02:46:24,042 --> 02:46:29,844
How could you leave us?

1448
02:46:31,950 --> 02:46:35,977
A-Di and l
can't go on without you!

1449
02:46:38,056 --> 02:46:43,460
Come back to us!

1450
02:46:46,431 --> 02:46:49,298
You were right again.

1451
02:46:51,736 --> 02:46:54,034
It was a waste of time.

1452
02:46:54,072 --> 02:46:56,905
Ato's copies were terrible.

1453
02:46:56,942 --> 02:46:59,877
Buyers are too smart now.

1454
02:46:59,911 --> 02:47:03,278
No one buys cheap imitations.

1455
02:47:05,951 --> 02:47:08,784
Boss Huang is no slouch.

1456
02:47:08,820 --> 02:47:16,591
Ato is now his mistress,
surprise, surprise!

1457
02:47:16,628 --> 02:47:19,893
She just sits
by the pool half-naked...

1458
02:47:19,931 --> 02:47:22,399
and the cash comes rolling in.

1459
02:47:22,434 --> 02:47:24,925
One smart lady!

1460
02:47:28,907 --> 02:47:32,070
Come back, NJ.

1461
02:47:32,110 --> 02:47:36,012
Rejoin the team.
We go back so far.

1462
02:47:36,047 --> 02:47:38,845
Staying home all day
is no solution.

1463
02:47:42,554 --> 02:47:46,490
I've worked my butt off
all these years!

1464
02:47:46,525 --> 02:47:49,426
I didn't do it for fun!

1465
02:47:49,461 --> 02:47:53,227
You know, NJ, I'm never happy.

1466
02:47:56,201 --> 02:47:59,364
When you don't love
what you do...

1467
02:47:59,404 --> 02:48:02,202
how could you be?

1468
02:48:11,082 --> 02:48:13,607
Can I speak to Grandma?

1469
02:48:13,652 --> 02:48:15,643
Of course, go ahead.

1470
02:48:37,576 --> 02:48:40,636
"I'm sorry, Grandma.

1471
02:48:40,679 --> 02:48:44,672
"lt wasn't that I didn't
want to talk to you.

1472
02:48:44,716 --> 02:48:50,313
"l think all the stuff
I could tell you...

1473
02:48:50,355 --> 02:48:54,052
"you must already know.

1474
02:48:54,092 --> 02:48:59,553
"Otherwise, you wouldn't always
tell me to 'Listen!'

1475
02:48:59,598 --> 02:49:02,624
"They all say you've gone away."

1476
02:49:03,768 --> 02:49:08,671
"But you didn't tell me
where you went.

1477
02:49:08,707 --> 02:49:15,738
"l guess it's someplace
you think I should know.

1478
02:49:15,780 --> 02:49:20,274
"But, Grandma, I know so little.

1479
02:49:20,318 --> 02:49:22,479
"Do you know
what I want to do...

1480
02:49:22,520 --> 02:49:25,489
"when I grow up?

1481
02:49:25,523 --> 02:49:29,960
"l want to tell people
things they don't know.

1482
02:49:29,995 --> 02:49:34,432
"Show them stuff
they haven't seen.

1483
02:49:34,466 --> 02:49:39,165
"lt'll be so much fun.

1484
02:49:39,204 --> 02:49:42,139
"Perhaps one day...

1485
02:49:42,173 --> 02:49:46,701
"I'll find out
where you've gone.

1486
02:49:46,745 --> 02:49:50,806
"lf I do, can I tell everyone...

1487
02:49:50,849 --> 02:49:53,977
"and bring them to visit you?"

1488
02:49:57,522 --> 02:49:59,149
"Grandma...

1489
02:49:59,190 --> 02:50:01,556
"l miss you.

1490
02:50:01,593 --> 02:50:05,620
"Especially when I see...

1491
02:50:05,664 --> 02:50:10,499
"my newborn cousin
who still doesn't have a name.

1492
02:50:10,535 --> 02:50:16,531
"He reminds me that you
always said you felt old.

1493
02:50:16,574 --> 02:50:20,305
"l want to tell him
that I feel...

1494
02:50:20,345 --> 02:50:22,313
"l am old, too."
