Wassup, this your bro Bobiță.

15
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:29,033
Thanks for the likes yesterday.

16
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:35,117
I'm up early, last night
I was with my mate Andrew Tate,

17
00:04:35,417 --> 00:04:38,643
picking up some hot stupid cunts

18
00:04:38,643 --> 00:04:43,950
who flocked around my Maserati
like they hadn't seen a car before.

19
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:49,033
They wouldn't let me go until
I fucked them in the ass, mouth, and cunt.

20
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:51,200
See ya, cheers!

21

Uber also has Uber for Ukraine.

24
00:06:05,684 --> 00:06:07,726
I heard a joke about it.

25
00:06:07,726 --> 00:06:13,742
In the US, where you can
buy guns from supermarkets,

26
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:20,684
a teenager buys a whole arsenal
to slaughter his schoolmates.

27
00:06:20,684 --> 00:06:24,976
The shop assistant goes
"Would you like a bazooka?

28
00:06:24,976 --> 00:06:30,492
For each bazooka we sell,
we send a machine gun to Ukraine."

29
00:06:34,917 --> 00:06:39,533
For all Bobiță fans,

Sure.
My friends with babies do the same.

00:09:51,533 --> 00:09:55,476
No babies for us yet,

Of course.

- He's out fishing.

Bebe called him,
he went out with him.

49
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:11,533
No way.
I'm here for his audition!

50
00:10:12,292 --> 00:10:14,059
I told him, but...

51
00:10:14,059 --> 00:10:19,117
And he let me drive here
first thing in the morning!

52
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,184
Whatever.

53
00:10:21,184 --> 00:10:24,117
He said you could do it over Zoom.

54
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:26,617
- He has the app?
- Of course!

55
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:29,726
We use it to talk to
our daughter in Spain.

56
00:10:29,726 --> 00:10:33,117
- She lives in Zaragoza.
- That's in Spain.

57
00:10:33,117 --> 00:10:34,742
No idea.

58

<i>Back then, they got

<i>If he wanted a footballer
to win the Golden Boot,</i>

61
00:10:44,726 --> 00:10:48,309
<i>they had to let him score
3-4 times in each game,</i>

62

<i>against each team.</i>

63
00:10:50,184 --> 00:10:54,976
<i>That's how Rodion Cămătaru

64
00:10:54,976 --> 00:10:57,851
Right. I'm ready.

65
00:10:57,851 --> 00:11:01,033
I need you to introduce yourself

66
00:11:01,542 --> 00:11:06,742

how it all happened.

67
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,101
In your own words.

68
00:11:09,101 --> 00:11:13,075
And show your
bandaged arm to the camera.

69
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:18,117
End with the advice
about following regulations.

70
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:24,325
Then I send the footage
to Forbidden Planet and they decide.

71
00:11:24,542 --> 00:11:26,434
Well, some foreigners do.

72
00:11:26,434 --> 00:11:31,700
And the contract will be with you?
It's 500 euro, right?

73
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:38,283
If they select him.
But it's the company who signs, not me.

74
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:45,867
Please use an artificial background.

75
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:51,742
We can't show you having fun.
It should look dramatic.

76
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:54,117
Something tragic.

77
00:11:54,417 --> 00:11:59,242
This is a better image.
Let me press "record".

78
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:01,533
You can start.

79
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:05,226
<i>My name is Pepenaș Rodion,

80
00:12:05,226 --> 00:12:06,493
<i>I'm 54.</i>

81
00:12:07,167 --> 00:12:10,950
<i>Two weeks ago we tested
a new planing machine</i>

82
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:14,950
<i>and I didn't follow
the operating instructions.</i>

83
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:18,325
<i>It caught my hand and cut off my fingers.</i>

84
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:23,533
<i>My coworkers helped me,
bandaged it with a shirt,</i>

85
00:12:23,533 --> 00:12:28,434
<i>at the hospital I got a lot of stitches,</i>

86
00:12:28,434 --> 00:12:32,325
<i>my fingers couldn't be saved,</i>

87
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:35,908
<i>and they put on a sterile bandage.</i>

88
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,950
- Were you wearing a helmet?
- No, but that doesn't protect hands.

89
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:44,518
I know, but they make me ask.

90
00:12:44,518 --> 00:12:48,559
They bought new equipment
with fancy protection sensors

91
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:51,325
and they want to show it off.

92
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:55,825
What was also very serious, I believe,

93
00:12:55,917 --> 00:13:01,533
is that his two coworkers
first called the bosses, who said

94
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:08,033
not to call an ambulance
until they check his employment contract.

95
00:13:08,292 --> 00:13:13,533
They left him howling in pain
for about an hour.

96
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:20,533
He won't tell you, but they took
his mobile phone, so he wouldn't call.

97
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:22,268
<i>Yes.</i>

98
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:25,075
Now the advice, right.

99
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:28,283
Go.

100
00:13:28,417 --> 00:13:31,950
<i>When new equipment
is brought into our plant,</i>

101
00:13:32,042 --> 00:13:37,408
<i>all my colleagues using them
should follow the instructions</i>

102
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:40,408
<i>so they don't share my fate.</i>

103
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,742
<i>I was lucky, it could have been worse.</i>

104
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:48,533
Excellent.
Let me take a photo.

105
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:51,033
A screenshot.

106
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,533
<i>- And now we hope.</i>
- Yes.

107
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:02,117
We could do with that money.

108
00:14:02,117 --> 00:14:06,033
Winter is coming
and we can't afford the heating.

109
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:09,700
It was cut off for two months last year.

110
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:12,117
My nose nearly froze off.

111
00:14:12,542 --> 00:14:17,408
Prices are so high,
what with the war in Ukraine...

112
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:19,518
Let's hope they pick you.

113
00:14:19,518 --> 00:14:23,684
Fuel prices are up too,
but it's not the war.

114
00:14:23,684 --> 00:14:28,742
Shell is boasting a 500% profit growth.

115
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:31,533
OMV too.

116
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:38,117
Those bastards deserve to be
burned alive in oil barrels.

117
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:43,492
<i>We too, if we had a union
we'd have had some leverage.</i>

118
00:14:43,667 --> 00:14:48,325
Should have unionised.
I'll hang up now.

119
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:54,450
- Strong rod, Rodi!
<i>- I caught some already.</i>

120
00:14:56,542 --> 00:15:01,851
Speaking of fish,
I just remembered that horrible joke.

121
00:15:01,851 --> 00:15:05,325
What does a blind man
say at the fish market?

122
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:08,117
"Hi there, girls!"

123
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:10,700
I knew it.

124
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:23,825

Aparently here, on the lake,

Syphilis and AIDS-ridden

138
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:21,658
None of those sluts

00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:06,533
Everyone just bulls forward,
forget traffic regulations!

159
00:19:07,167 --> 00:19:09,075
Poor souls!

160
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:13,575
There's no more room.
We'll suffocate each other.

161
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:16,518
Sometimes when
I get out of the car...

162
00:19:16,518 --> 00:19:18,976
I feel like an astronaut.

163
00:19:18,976 --> 00:19:20,950
Look at this one.

164
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:26,908
Come upon a planet with
an atmosphere made of 100% farts.

165
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:32,518
There's the illegal garbage burning, too.

166
00:19:32,518 --> 00:19:37,700
I hope those guys
die slowly and painfully of cancer.

167
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:40,768
Gypsies, all of them.

168
00:19:40,768 --> 00:19:45,283
It's foreign companies
sending garbage from all over Europe.

169
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:49,575
- Germany, Italy...
- But our Gypsies burn them.

170
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:54,950
- Why doesn't anyone stop them?
- It's a vicious circle.

171
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:58,700
...if I forgot and handed you the knife,

172
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:02,950
you slapped me
because that starts the argument.

173
00:20:03,042 --> 00:20:05,200
I can't remember.

174
00:20:05,792 --> 00:20:07,283
Of course.

175
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:08,825
<i>Hi!</i>

176
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,450
- Hello.
<i>- What's up, Angi?</i>

177
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:17,533
Looking for a double-muzzled dog
that can bark while it bites.

178
00:20:17,667 --> 00:20:18,851
<i>What?</i>

179
00:20:18,851 --> 00:20:21,117
Working, what else?

180
00:20:21,117 --> 00:20:24,492
I sent you the first handicapped guy.

181
00:20:24,492 --> 00:20:27,242
<i>I saw. Is he able?</i>

182
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:31,700
Not sure, he was gone fishing,
we had a Zoom call.

183
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:34,934
But he's articulate and cooperates.

184
00:20:34,934 --> 00:20:39,742
<i>We have one more in Ferentari.
I mailed you the phone and address.</i>

185
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:43,700
Ferentari? OK.

186
00:20:44,792 --> 00:20:50,742
<i>- When can you have them done?</i>
- Including the new one, maybe 1:30.

187
00:20:51,042 --> 00:20:52,934
Two o'clock tops.

188
00:20:52,934 --> 00:20:57,325
<i>Good. Don't miss
the pre-production meeting.</i>

189
00:20:57,625 --> 00:21:00,075
I'm dead tired!

190
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:05,533
You know I put in 16 hours a day
for the History Channel idiots.

191
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:10,450
<i>Can't be helped, everyone's
filming for</i> Canis Majoris Attacks.

192
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:13,268
<i>They're doing overtime too.</i>

193
00:21:13,268 --> 00:21:16,992
<i>I'm low on staff,
there's a lot of green screen.</i>

194
00:21:17,542 --> 00:21:22,492
<i>The director is a crazy German,
Uwe Boll, who beats people up.</i>

195
00:21:22,492 --> 00:21:24,867
And I'm telling you I'm dead.

196
00:21:25,042 --> 00:21:30,518
It's one thing to be in the office
and another to do fieldwork,

197
00:21:30,518 --> 00:21:33,018
doubling as driver and whatnot.

198
00:21:33,018 --> 00:21:38,867
Last night I fell asleep at the wheel,
I woke up when a lorry honked.

199
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,950
<i>I've been doing
16-17 hours for a month.</i>

200
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:45,075
<i>Just have a strong coffee.</i>

201
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:50,617
<i>If I had anyone else to send,
I would. See you at four.</i>

202
00:21:50,617 --> 00:21:52,742
<i>Can't be helped. Bye.</i>

203
00:21:58,542 --> 00:22:00,325
Hard times.

204
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,700
Hope he dies
slowly and painfully of cancer too.

205
00:22:03,958 --> 00:22:09,393
They make dozens of thousands of euros.
It makes 16 hours a day worth it.

206
00:22:09,393 --> 00:22:13,309
And I need to beg them
for my fucking salary!

207
00:22:13,309 --> 00:22:14,867
Language!

211
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:56,726
always shouted "Christ is risen!"

212

merrily answered "Truly He is risen!"

Hello?

No, no.

I'm not interested in insurance.

216
00:23:25,792 --> 00:23:28,101
No, Madam, I'm busy.

217
00:23:28,101 --> 00:23:32,158
I'm busy later too.
And tomorrow and the day after.

218
00:23:33,583 --> 00:23:38,617
I'm not interested,
why do you insist?

Hello.

- Which part got returned to the owner?
- Everything over there.

223
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,408
Who will do the exhumations?

224
00:24:05,408 --> 00:24:09,825
No idea, Madam,
we just know there was a lawsuit.

225
00:24:10,292 --> 00:24:12,742
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

226
00:24:13,208 --> 00:24:16,408
How are they supposed to know, Mum?

227
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:30,408
Sanda told me you're doing
those vulgar videos again.

228
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:32,809
Big deal.

229
00:24:32,809 --> 00:24:35,867
I'm just making fun of things.

230
00:24:36,625 --> 00:24:42,200
So I don't go crazy.
All day long, just work, work, work.

This is hardly a woman's job.

00:26:32,042 --> 00:26:35,075
- What's your job?
- Me?

235
00:26:35,292 --> 00:26:37,242
I'm a chef.

236
00:26:39,042 --> 00:26:43,325
Good one.
So that's a strong man's job?

You should know
the best chefs are always men.

You don't say!

How much do you make?

240
00:26:59,125 --> 00:27:02,143
- The basic salary...
- Not that.

241
00:27:02,143 --> 00:27:05,158
It's the tips that make the difference.

242
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:10,783
- I don't count that.
- You don't trust me?

No.

I need to film you so they can

My name is Docea Mariana, I'm 43.

258
00:31:28,625 --> 00:31:32,559
One day, I was working overtime,
I was tired.

259
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:36,742
At the end of my shift
I had to go along a walkway,

260
00:31:36,875 --> 00:31:41,742
I lost my balance and fell,
breaking my spine and hip.

261
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:45,658
It left me in this wheelchair forever.

262
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:50,908
That day, it was a coworker's birthday.

263
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,809
He offered us
some brandy in plastic cups.

264
00:31:55,809 --> 00:32:01,283
I mention this because
I had been accused of being drunk.

265
00:32:01,708 --> 00:32:05,184
- But I only had a sip.
- I see.

266
00:32:05,184 --> 00:32:08,893
- Did you wear your helmet?
- Yes, but what was the use?

267
00:32:08,893 --> 00:32:11,908
It could have happened to anyone.

268
00:32:13,292 --> 00:32:16,908
Now your advice to your coworkers.

269
00:32:17,292 --> 00:32:22,908
I ask my colleagues
to wear the protective equipment,

270
00:32:22,908 --> 00:32:28,283
safety helmet included,
and never drink alcohol.

271
00:32:29,458 --> 00:32:30,867
Perfect!

272
00:32:32,125 --> 00:32:36,700
I'll just be a moment,
while I transfer the footage.

273
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,393
Sure.

274
00:32:38,393 --> 00:32:43,867
I have to back it up,
they need it for a meeting.

275
00:32:46,833 --> 00:32:49,976
You know, my car is downstairs.

276
00:32:49,976 --> 00:32:54,101
There were some shady guys there,
I'm a bit worried.

277
00:32:54,101 --> 00:32:56,908
Don't worry, it's safe.

278
00:32:56,908 --> 00:33:01,325
I was a bit stressed,
with my laptop and my phone...

279
00:33:01,458 --> 00:33:04,143
The neighbourhood is dirty,
but the people are good.

280
00:33:04,143 --> 00:33:09,117
The garbage isn't collected for months.
But we're good people.

281
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:13,476
When that hysterical mayor
argued with the waste disposal guys,

282
00:33:13,476 --> 00:33:15,643
Sector 1 was full of rats too.

283
00:33:15,643 --> 00:33:20,325
The 'civilised' throw even more
garbage on the street.

284
00:33:26,833 --> 00:33:30,268
- If I may ask something...
- Please.

285
00:33:30,268 --> 00:33:34,393
When do I know if I've been picked?

286
00:33:34,393 --> 00:33:38,268
This evening, we'll call you.

287
00:33:38,268 --> 00:33:41,492
I hope they pick you,
you stand a good chance.

288
00:33:41,583 --> 00:33:45,059
We have only four cases
and you're the only woman.

289
00:33:45,059 --> 00:33:50,533
- But it's the Austrians who decide.
- I see.

290
00:33:53,458 --> 00:33:57,325
That cat is gorgeous,
so realistic.

291
00:33:57,792 --> 00:34:02,184
- You can have it.
- God, no! Just saying.

292
00:34:02,184 --> 00:34:07,476
Please, it's my pleasure.
A souvenir.

293
00:34:07,476 --> 00:34:11,033
- Maybe the children like it.
- They have others.

294
00:34:25,583 --> 00:34:28,809
You know I'm a believer.

295
00:34:28,809 --> 00:34:33,893
An Orthodox Christian,
though I don't go to church.

296
00:34:33,893 --> 00:34:39,075
But I realised I look
like Father Arsenie Boca!

297
00:34:39,958 --> 00:34:41,575
Look!

298
00:34:45,292 --> 00:34:47,700
Same forehead, same...

299
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:54,992
The Dostoyevskian gaze, the eyebrows...

300
00:34:55,625 --> 00:34:59,658
What could it mean?
It must mean something, right?

301
00:35:00,292 --> 00:35:04,184
I'd ask Father Visarion Alexa,

302
00:35:04,184 --> 00:35:08,742
but he's busy ass-fucking
a parishioner behind the altar.

303
00:35:15,458 --> 00:35:18,075
Spare some change?

304
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:04,242
Babies born left and right!

305
00:36:37,583 --> 00:36:39,684
- Boy or girl?
- Boy.

306
00:36:39,684 --> 00:36:42,700
Better. Girls have it harder.

307
00:36:49,333 --> 00:36:51,492
What's going on?

308
00:36:55,917 --> 00:36:58,700
- Move, lady!
- What's wrong?

309
00:36:58,792 --> 00:37:01,700
Get medical help if you're that nervous!

310
00:37:03,125 --> 00:37:06,408
Hurrying like you're late
to your own funeral.

311
00:37:06,833 --> 00:37:09,283
Oi, fucking blonde skank!

312
00:37:09,625 --> 00:37:13,976
Who was the fucking idiot
who taught you to drive?

313
00:37:13,976 --> 00:37:16,325
Like you own all the lanes!

314
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:21,158
- Are you fucking with me?
- Fuck off, retard!

315
00:37:21,333 --> 00:37:23,700
Fucking piece of shit!

316
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:28,117
Fuck you and your mum!

317
00:37:39,333 --> 00:37:41,450
Suck it, cocksucker!

318
00:37:58,333 --> 00:38:02,783
Don't make me come over
and fuck you in the ass!

319
00:38:03,958 --> 00:38:09,658
- Fuck off!
- You suck cock to get your license?

320
00:38:12,458 --> 00:38:14,992
Fuck off, you moron!

321
00:39:20,167 --> 00:39:24,117
Mr Trofăilă is still
in his mindfulness class.

322
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:26,768
Follow me to Brâncuși Hall.

323
00:39:26,768 --> 00:39:30,408
But we had an appointment!
My mother did.

324
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:35,283
As Aristotle says
the improbable is a possibility.

325
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:42,726
- Hello!
- Hello.

326
00:39:42,726 --> 00:39:44,976
- Dan Trofăilă.
- Angela Răducanu.

327
00:39:44,976 --> 00:39:47,033
I was looking at...

328
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:49,809
A joke for our business partners.

329
00:39:49,809 --> 00:39:53,184
When they see it, they freeze,
thinking it's Marx's.

330
00:39:53,184 --> 00:39:56,117
- It's just a book about New York.
- Funny.

331
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:59,075
It looks like a gold bar.

332
00:39:59,583 --> 00:40:04,033
The author's name is Goldsmith.
No further comment.

333
00:40:04,033 --> 00:40:08,893
The cemetery was extended
aggressively, without a permit.

334
00:40:08,893 --> 00:40:12,476
In breach of the minimum
sanitary distance of 50 m.

335
00:40:12,476 --> 00:40:15,200
Plus some trees.

336
00:40:15,583 --> 00:40:18,783
It's not your fault,
but it's not ours either.

337
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:21,851
The innocents pay for corruption.

338
00:40:21,851 --> 00:40:25,726
But I, well, my mother
bought that burial place legally!

339
00:40:25,726 --> 00:40:29,825
You acted in good faith.

340
00:40:29,917 --> 00:40:32,450
But the law wasn't observed.

341
00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:36,617
They invaded the land
that we later bought.

342
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:39,934
16 m of the cemetery
encroaches onto our property.

343
00:40:39,934 --> 00:40:42,492
Not to mention the legal borderline.

344
00:40:42,583 --> 00:40:47,075
My clients can't step out among
the graves of a private cemetery.

345
00:40:47,542 --> 00:40:52,268
Imagine having coffee on your terrace
next to a wailing widow in black.

346
00:40:52,268 --> 00:40:55,908
At least if it was
a cute young widow, like you.

347
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,184
- Do I digress?
- Sort of.

348
00:40:58,184 --> 00:41:02,018
The right of ownership
is guaranteed by the Constitution.

349
00:41:02,018 --> 00:41:05,033
Article 44, paragraph 2.

350
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:09,992
"Private property is guaranteed
and protected by law.

351
00:41:09,992 --> 00:41:12,268
Irrespective of who owns it."

352
00:41:12,268 --> 00:41:15,518
- It says so right here.
- I know.

353
00:41:15,518 --> 00:41:20,726
But we have to unearth my grandparents.
My mother's parents.

354
00:41:20,726 --> 00:41:24,617
- We have a problem with that.
- A religious problem?

355
00:41:25,583 --> 00:41:33,325
Rest assured, we've hired
elite priests recommended by Mr. Pleșu.

356
00:41:33,625 --> 00:41:39,075
We make sure it's done by the canon.
Reburial service and all.

357
00:41:39,075 --> 00:41:42,184
I've lost my mother too,
I am mindful of this.

358
00:41:42,184 --> 00:41:45,476
- This isn't normal!
- I understand your distress.

359
00:41:45,476 --> 00:41:49,700
But theologically speaking,
we're good. 100%.

360
00:41:49,875 --> 00:41:53,101
And our company
covers all the expenses.

361
00:41:53,101 --> 00:41:56,283
Even a 10-year subscription
to another cemetery.

362
00:41:56,625 --> 00:42:00,450
They get reburied
after 7 years anyway.

363
00:42:00,625 --> 00:42:04,325
Some of the dead were
more reticent, I mean recent.

364
00:42:04,417 --> 00:42:09,059
The bodies are rotting, full of worms...

365
00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:12,075
My grandma was buried
just five months ago!

366
00:42:14,375 --> 00:42:19,559
At any rate, we provide
the hearse and premium coffins,

367
00:42:19,559 --> 00:42:22,908
from the funeral company
that handled King Michael I.

368
00:42:23,042 --> 00:42:24,450
Top specialists.

369
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:29,325
Although the municipality
or the private cemetery are responsible.

370
00:42:29,875 --> 00:42:34,075
You could sue them,
but it takes time.

371
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:38,325
- My mother can't sleep...
- I can understand.

372
00:42:38,917 --> 00:42:40,242
It's tough.

373
00:42:40,667 --> 00:42:44,408
We made a Minecraft portal,
want to see?

374
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:47,200
Wait for me in the cubiculum.

375
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,617
I told you, religiously speaking,

376
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:55,559
it's all by the book,
they'll be relocated soon.

377
00:42:55,559 --> 00:42:59,559
Both I and the manager
Van Meegeren are religious,

378
00:42:59,559 --> 00:43:02,476
though he's a Protestant,
not one of ours.

379
00:43:02,476 --> 00:43:04,033
I guess.

380
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:07,226
Allow me to offer you
my business card.

381
00:43:07,226 --> 00:43:10,658
Call me any time,
I'm here at your pleasure.

382
00:43:11,458 --> 00:43:13,742
- Thank you.
- Please.

383
00:43:14,833 --> 00:43:17,450
Thanks.
Who's that in the painting?

384
00:43:18,208 --> 00:43:19,643
You've noticed.

385
00:43:19,643 --> 00:43:22,492
It's a Fayum portrait.
A copy, of course.

386
00:43:22,667 --> 00:43:25,309
We are trying to purchase the original.

387
00:43:25,309 --> 00:43:30,908
These covered the faces of the dead
when they were interred.

388
00:43:31,083 --> 00:43:36,101
- In Egypt, first and second centuries AD.
- So she died young.

389
00:43:36,101 --> 00:43:37,450
Quite.

390
00:43:37,450 --> 00:43:40,992
The coincidence is a bit creepy,
if I say so myself.

391
00:43:41,958 --> 00:43:44,783
Take it down until we sort things out.

392
00:44:01,792 --> 00:44:04,617
This is Dallas, Texas!

393
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:09,684
Your bro Bobiță Ewing
came out of this skyscraper.

394
00:44:09,684 --> 00:44:15,976
I was in JR's office
and our old mum came in and said

395
00:44:15,976 --> 00:44:21,325
"Bobby, a hard cock without a story
doesn't get the cunt!

396
00:44:21,583 --> 00:44:25,809
"Jock doesn't fuck me lately,
won't you give me some?

397
00:44:25,809 --> 00:44:27,601
"I won't tell Pamela.

398
00:44:27,601 --> 00:44:30,976
I'll give you a million dollars
and an oil well."

399
00:44:30,976 --> 00:44:35,018
I was tired, but when
I heard about all that money

400
00:44:35,018 --> 00:44:39,018
I got so hard
my balls were hurting like crazy!

401
00:44:39,018 --> 00:44:43,242
I said "Mommy, I'll fuck you,
but only in the mouth, no dentures."

402
00:44:43,242 --> 00:44:47,033
She closed the door,
took off her dentures

403
00:44:47,033 --> 00:44:50,950
and sucked me off
with those toothless gums...

404
00:45:19,625 --> 00:45:21,825
Sod off.

405
00:46:08,083 --> 00:46:13,492
It's lunchtime,
Bobiță's eating fresh fish!

406
00:47:02,417 --> 00:47:06,075
- Good fish?
- Yes, it's easy to swallow.

407
00:47:10,542 --> 00:47:12,283
Please, Madam.

408
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:28,200
Get the fuck out of here!

409
00:47:28,417 --> 00:47:31,200
Leave her alone!

410
00:47:31,625 --> 00:47:33,658
Out, you fucking scum!

411
00:47:34,917 --> 00:47:36,700
You're the scum!

412
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:00,700
Fuck you!

413
00:48:06,208 --> 00:48:07,492
Kisses!

414
00:49:28,458 --> 00:49:35,518
<i>...Where have they gone,
The golden years of their glory?</i>

415
00:49:35,518 --> 00:49:42,408
<i>Where are the daggers,
Horses and rifles in outlaw stories?</i>

416
00:49:54,042 --> 00:50:00,367
<i>The highway he roams no more
To put the rich under the sword</i>

417
00:50:00,833 --> 00:50:08,033
<i>And feed the poor
With the purse of the lord</i>

418
00:50:40,792 --> 00:50:44,950
PRIVATE PARKING

419
00:51:35,167 --> 00:51:37,726
Really, my name is Angela too!

420
00:51:37,726 --> 00:51:39,976
- Come in!
- Thank you.

421
00:51:39,976 --> 00:51:44,408
Ovidiu should come back
from the doctor's any moment.

422
00:51:44,625 --> 00:51:48,117
- I'll take my shoes off.
- No need!

423
00:51:52,132 --> 00:51:53,209
A coffee?

424
00:51:53,209 --> 00:51:57,742
Please, I'm dead tired!
An espresso would be great.

425
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,742
When I heard your name,
I thought you were a Gypsy.

426
00:52:02,292 --> 00:52:06,242
Isn't Răducanu a Gypsy name?

427
00:52:06,242 --> 00:52:10,117
- I don't know.
- Like that football player!

428
00:52:10,292 --> 00:52:12,408
Who, Cămătaru?

429
00:52:12,408 --> 00:52:16,325
No, the goalkeeper, Răducanu.

430
00:52:16,750 --> 00:52:20,617
And Emma Răducanu,
the tennis champion.

431
00:52:20,617 --> 00:52:26,033
- No idea, but I'm not.
- I have nothing against them, God forbid!

432
00:52:26,625 --> 00:52:28,283
Just saying.

433
00:52:30,083 --> 00:52:34,575
I was a taxi driver,
now I'm retired.

434
00:52:35,958 --> 00:52:41,684
- Does Uber pay into your pension?
- No, and no medical insurance either.

435
00:52:41,684 --> 00:52:46,768
- It's considered a phone app.
- Really!

436
00:52:46,768 --> 00:52:50,700
My full-time job is
collaboration-based as well.

437
00:52:52,042 --> 00:52:54,700
What was it like,
being a taxi driver?

438
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:57,325
Back then...

439
00:52:57,792 --> 00:53:01,575
It was great because I was young!

440
00:53:01,750 --> 00:53:06,934
And we didn't have this horrible traffic.

441
00:53:06,934 --> 00:53:09,684
- I couldn't drive through this.
- Really?

442
00:53:09,684 --> 00:53:10,908
Yes.

443
00:53:12,250 --> 00:53:15,408
That's how I met my husband,
in my taxi.

444
00:53:15,542 --> 00:53:19,283
- You did?
- Yes, the filthy bastard!

445
00:53:20,667 --> 00:53:23,617
<i>He got into my taxi dead drunk.</i>

446
00:53:24,333 --> 00:53:27,908
<i>My ex-husband had been a drunkard too.</i>

447
00:53:28,208 --> 00:53:33,117
<i>When I first picked up Gyuri,
he was also dead drunk.</i>

448
00:53:33,667 --> 00:53:35,408
<i>But he was elegant!</i>

449
00:53:35,917 --> 00:53:37,992
Comrade! Where to?

450
00:53:39,833 --> 00:53:43,559
- I hope I didn't upset you.
- Oh, no.

451
00:53:43,559 --> 00:53:45,742
You were a true gentleman.

452
00:53:46,542 --> 00:53:49,492
My ex-husband drank,
I'm used to it.

453
00:53:50,083 --> 00:53:54,200
<i>I should have known.
He was married, too.</i>

454
00:53:54,500 --> 00:54:00,059
<i>Stay away from married men
like they're the devil!</i>

455
00:54:00,059 --> 00:54:04,117
- I'm sorry, it's the only drink I have.
- This will do.

456
00:54:04,875 --> 00:54:08,908
<i>He said he was going
to India to work in drilling.</i>

457
00:54:09,542 --> 00:54:11,242
<i>And he did, briefly.</i>

458
00:54:11,242 --> 00:54:14,742
<i>Good morning, Sir.
Can I help?</i>

459
00:54:14,875 --> 00:54:18,408
<i>Then he came back.</i>

460
00:54:19,667 --> 00:54:24,325
<i>Because someone informed
the Secret Police about him.</i>

461
00:54:24,583 --> 00:54:26,726
<i>He came back,</i>

462
00:54:26,726 --> 00:54:30,393
<i>fell in with some whores,
the baby was already born...</i>

463
00:54:30,393 --> 00:54:33,867
<i>So I told him,
make up your mind!</i>

464
00:54:34,083 --> 00:54:39,617
<i>He quit drinking, quit the whores.
It was good, for a while.</i>

465
00:54:40,042 --> 00:54:42,992
<i>Then the Revolution came</i>

466
00:54:42,992 --> 00:54:46,575
<i>and we got divided by politics, damn them.</i>

467
00:54:46,708 --> 00:54:50,617
<i>Being an ethnic Hungarian,
he went to Târgu Mureș</i>

468
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:57,658
<i>back then we almost had
a civil war, in March 1990.</i>

469
00:54:58,125 --> 00:55:02,492
<i>Naturally, I sided with the Romanians,
he with the Hungarians.</i>

470
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,033
<i>We made up, but...</i>

471
00:55:05,708 --> 00:55:07,283
Why are you here?

472
00:55:08,375 --> 00:55:11,867
To tell you
I can't live without you.

473
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:16,492
<i>He had conflicts
with some Romanians at work.</i>

474
00:55:16,792 --> 00:55:21,575
<i>Then he lost his job.
Around '93 he started drinking again.</i>

475
00:55:23,417 --> 00:55:26,992
<i>Good Lord, the grief he gave me.</i>

476
00:55:27,167 --> 00:55:29,950
I only repeat things once.

477
00:55:29,950 --> 00:55:32,158
Never twice.

478
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:43,492
<i>After a lifetime's work as a taxi driver,
my pension is shit.</i>

479
00:55:44,917 --> 00:55:47,825
<i>My life's been nothing but torment.</i>

480
00:55:48,417 --> 00:55:50,200
<i>When did he die?</i>

481
00:55:51,250 --> 00:55:52,450
Who?

482
00:55:54,042 --> 00:55:55,742
Your husband.

483
00:55:56,208 --> 00:56:00,325
The bastard's alive and well,
in the other room!

484
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:03,434
- Gyuri!
- I was watching the Queen!

485
00:56:03,434 --> 00:56:05,700
May she rest in peace.

486
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:08,450
This is Angela, my namesake.

487
00:56:08,667 --> 00:56:13,075
- Hello, Ms Angela! I'm Gyuri.
- Nice to meet you.

488
00:56:13,167 --> 00:56:17,533
You are an elegant, sweet girl!

489
00:56:17,833 --> 00:56:20,184
And you look like Clark Gable!

490
00:56:20,184 --> 00:56:22,117
- Thank you!
- Oh my!

491
00:56:23,583 --> 00:56:27,075
Shall I recite you some Petőfi Sándor?

492
00:56:37,208 --> 00:56:39,393
- Wow, lovely!
- Now some Eminescu.

493
00:56:39,393 --> 00:56:41,200
"If...

494
00:56:41,292 --> 00:56:46,184
If there was ever a way to acquire
My heart's most fiery inner desire,

495
00:56:46,184 --> 00:56:51,200
I would become a mirror aglow
To take you in from head to toe!"

496
00:56:51,458 --> 00:56:53,617
- Lovely.
- Show off!

497
00:56:53,617 --> 00:56:55,643
- Ovidiu is back.
- Hello.

498
00:56:55,643 --> 00:56:57,867
- Angela.
- Hey, Ovidiu!

499
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:01,684
This is Angela, love.

500
00:57:01,684 --> 00:57:04,309
I'll get my backpack.

501
00:57:04,309 --> 00:57:06,075
Take your time.

502
00:57:07,167 --> 00:57:08,408
- All good?
- Yes.

503
00:57:08,625 --> 00:57:12,783
IT'S LATER THAN YOU THINK

504
00:57:18,292 --> 00:57:21,893
"While I still live, I must contend

505
00:57:21,893 --> 00:57:26,518
that I have not yet met my end!"

506
00:57:26,518 --> 00:57:28,434
Gyuri dear, sit down.

507
00:57:28,434 --> 00:57:30,575
- Thank you!
- Sit down.

508
00:57:31,583 --> 00:57:33,992
Mr Ovidiu, you can start.

509
00:57:33,992 --> 00:57:35,992
My name is Ovidiu Bucă.

510
00:57:36,333 --> 00:57:41,783
During the 2020 pandemic,
after working overtime,

511
00:57:42,042 --> 00:57:47,742
I was heading towards the gate,
passing by a barrier,

512
00:57:47,958 --> 00:57:53,575
a coworker driving an old Dacia
was speeding towards it.

513
00:57:53,750 --> 00:57:57,408
The barrier wasn't painted appropriately

514
00:57:57,500 --> 00:58:00,908
so he hit it and the barrier hit my head.

515
00:58:01,833 --> 00:58:05,700
That's all I remember,
as I then fell into a coma.

516
00:58:05,792 --> 00:58:08,700
I woke up a year and one month later.

517
00:58:09,625 --> 00:58:14,601
After all that time in a hospital bed,

518
00:58:14,601 --> 00:58:18,283
my back was full of raw bedsores.

519
00:58:18,667 --> 00:58:21,533
And I'm wheelchair-bound.

520
00:58:22,042 --> 00:58:27,033
Now the advice
about safety equipment.

521
00:58:27,542 --> 00:58:30,393
It's very important
that everyone wears it.

522
00:58:30,393 --> 00:58:32,351
- With more conviction.
- OK.

523
00:58:32,351 --> 00:58:35,851
It's very important that everyone
wears the safety equipment!

524
00:58:35,851 --> 00:58:37,158
Perfect.

525
00:58:37,417 --> 00:58:40,450
- It really is important.
- I'll take a photo.

526
00:58:40,450 --> 00:58:45,268
Now to see who
our foreign clients pick.

527
00:58:45,268 --> 00:58:50,575
I don't think they'll pick him.
He's sued the company.

528
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,643
I hope it's not that idiot Pepenaș!

529
00:58:53,643 --> 00:58:56,226
He's so obsessive
about "that idiot Pepenaș",

530
00:58:56,226 --> 00:59:01,033
like in <i>The Count of Monte Cristo</i>!

531
00:59:01,208 --> 00:59:05,117
- You know it?
- Never saw the film.

532
00:59:05,292 --> 00:59:12,492
There's this scene with two friends
sentenced to death by hanging,

533
00:59:12,667 --> 00:59:15,992
and one is pardoned at the last moment.

534
00:59:16,167 --> 00:59:20,184
The other one complains,
not that he is to be executed,

535
00:59:20,184 --> 00:59:22,476
but that his friend is not.

536
00:59:22,476 --> 00:59:26,700
In a way, I understand.
It's easier when you're not alone.

537
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:29,742
There's a Slovenian joke

538
00:59:30,417 --> 00:59:35,434
God tells a peasant
"Make a wish.

539
00:59:35,434 --> 00:59:39,559
It will be granted, and
your neighbour will also get it, doubled."

540
00:59:39,559 --> 00:59:41,976
The peasant thinks

541
00:59:41,976 --> 00:59:47,242
"He gets it too, but doubled?
Take out one of my eyes!"

542
00:59:47,875 --> 00:59:53,617
"Greek town, feels like home."
Eight letters.

543
00:59:53,617 --> 00:59:55,658
Starts with a K.

544
00:59:56,792 --> 00:59:58,283
No idea.

545
00:59:58,375 --> 01:00:01,325
What do you think about Viktor Orbán?

546
01:00:01,542 --> 01:00:05,908
Orbán Viktor is a great leader!

547
01:00:06,083 --> 01:00:11,184
An extraordinary man!
Hungary has never before had

548
01:00:11,184 --> 01:00:16,143
a leader who cares so much
for the population's wellbeing.

549
01:00:16,143 --> 01:00:22,059
- Isn't he a dictator?
- No, he is not!

550
01:00:22,059 --> 01:00:27,950
Everything he does is...

551
01:00:28,208 --> 01:00:30,825
For the benefit of the people!

552
01:00:31,458 --> 01:00:33,184
Could be "Kalamata".

553
01:00:33,184 --> 01:00:36,075
Kalamata? Yes!

554
01:00:36,375 --> 01:00:40,617
Here's another one:
"Emotion after a roast" nine letters.

555
01:00:40,875 --> 01:00:42,059
"Heartburn".

556
01:00:42,059 --> 01:00:44,867
"Major stars" eight letters.

557
01:00:45,417 --> 01:00:46,809
"Insignia".

558
01:00:46,809 --> 01:00:49,492
"White for the yellow".

559
01:00:49,625 --> 01:00:50,726
"Rice."

560
01:00:50,726 --> 01:00:52,226
Last one

561
01:00:52,226 --> 01:00:55,117
"Serves God and country tidily."

562
01:00:55,208 --> 01:00:57,617
- What is it?
- "Orderly."

563
01:00:58,208 --> 01:01:01,184
- Lovely meeting you.
- Likewise.

564
01:01:01,184 --> 01:01:04,200
Take care of yourself, dear.

565
01:01:04,417 --> 01:01:09,809
Men come in two kinds,
the good and the bad.

566
01:01:09,809 --> 01:01:12,117
Said my mother from Uranus.

567
01:03:48,417 --> 01:03:52,575
EXCELLENCE IN ROBOTIC SURGERY

568
01:04:30,167 --> 01:04:32,700
What do you do after work?

569
01:04:32,875 --> 01:04:34,184
Why?

570
01:04:34,184 --> 01:04:37,158
We're celebrating
a fellow chef's birthday.

571
01:04:38,792 --> 01:04:41,018
I thought you could come.

572
01:04:41,018 --> 01:04:43,658
After you get changed and
put on some makeup.

573
01:04:44,708 --> 01:04:48,492
I'm sure with some touching-up
you look like a lady.

574
01:04:52,375 --> 01:04:54,075
I'm busy tonight.

575
01:04:57,875 --> 01:05:01,242
Sorry to hear it.
Very sorry to hear it.

576
01:05:02,083 --> 01:05:03,976
That will be 100.

577
01:05:03,976 --> 01:05:05,575
Keep it.

578
01:05:07,292 --> 01:05:09,700
It really is such a pity.

579
01:05:13,583 --> 01:05:15,518
"Like a lady."

580
01:05:15,518 --> 01:05:18,617
What the hell do I look like now?

581
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:29,117
Here is the contract,
we'll need your signature.

582
01:05:29,417 --> 01:05:32,908
We have a side room, you see.

583
01:05:33,083 --> 01:05:36,783
I can't really book
the whole restaurant for this amount.

584
01:05:37,333 --> 01:05:40,408
Just for two hours,
our clients' lunch break.

585
01:05:40,917 --> 01:05:42,325
But still...

586
01:05:42,917 --> 01:05:47,533
- We're talking 8-10 people, right?
- Could be 11 or 12.

587
01:05:47,917 --> 01:05:51,601
- How about this lovely table?
- No way!

588
01:05:51,601 --> 01:05:54,643
They're some snobbish Austrians,

589
01:05:54,643 --> 01:06:00,033
they want the whole
restaurant for themselves!

590
01:06:00,333 --> 01:06:04,226
- We'll have a string quartet too.
- A what?

591
01:06:04,226 --> 01:06:08,309
We'll bring them a string quartet

592
01:06:08,309 --> 01:06:13,117
to play while they eat.
Schubert, Couperin, stuff.

593
01:06:13,250 --> 01:06:16,408
<i>The Decline of the West</i>
by Oswald Spengler.

594
01:06:16,542 --> 01:06:19,684
They say that
Antoine Bourdain, the chef,

595
01:06:19,684 --> 01:06:25,992
killed himself after seeing his chick
getting pumped by a loser.

596
01:06:26,125 --> 01:06:28,992
- So he killed himself.
- I don't know.

597
01:06:30,375 --> 01:06:37,518
I'll call Albeșteanu to ask
8,000 euro more for the whole place.

598
01:06:37,518 --> 01:06:38,783
No problem.

599
01:07:00,583 --> 01:07:03,393
Hi from London, you peasants,

600
01:07:03,393 --> 01:07:06,825
from the Queen's funeral,
that poor cunt!

601
01:07:06,958 --> 01:07:10,226
While they were putting her in the grave,

602
01:07:10,226 --> 01:07:13,450
I looked down with tears in my eyes

603
01:07:13,625 --> 01:07:17,992
and through my tears
I saw a gorgeous lawn,

604
01:07:18,083 --> 01:07:23,700
every juicy blade cut to size.

605
01:07:23,792 --> 01:07:26,768
So I asked the new king, Charles.

606
01:07:26,768 --> 01:07:32,059
I knew him from Viscri,
we double-teamed a truck stop slut there.

607
01:07:32,059 --> 01:07:35,476
He mostly ass-licked her,
his age doesn't help.

608
01:07:35,476 --> 01:07:37,393
I say, "Your Majesty,

609
01:07:37,393 --> 01:07:41,658
how can I grow a lawn like this
around my villa?"

610
01:07:41,750 --> 01:07:45,158
Charles says "Bo-bee-tzuh,

611
01:07:45,158 --> 01:07:50,893
you water the grass,
mow it, that's about it."

612
01:07:50,893 --> 01:07:55,033
"Really?" I ask.
"Yes," says Charles.

613
01:07:55,125 --> 01:07:59,742
"300 years later,
you'll have a lawn like this."

614
01:08:46,167 --> 01:08:48,143
<i>Hey, what's up?</i>

615
01:08:48,143 --> 01:08:53,450
All good, love,
only we can't meet this afternoon.

616
01:08:53,542 --> 01:08:57,309
I was supposed to have time off,
but they're killing me.

617
01:08:57,309 --> 01:08:59,226
I have to go to...

618
01:08:59,226 --> 01:09:03,408
<i>I see. Not even
for ten minutes?</i>

619
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:08,700
- I can't! Not until late tonight!
- <i>Let's see.</i>

620
01:09:08,917 --> 01:09:13,117
<i>- Should I call later?</i>
- Sure, I don't have obligations.

621
01:09:13,708 --> 01:09:15,783
<i>I got the innuendo.</i>

622
01:09:15,875 --> 01:09:22,283
It's no innuendo, I'm just saying
I don't want a new cage.

623
01:09:22,417 --> 01:09:24,992
I'm staying a free woman.

624
01:09:25,083 --> 01:09:26,726
<i>Alright, later then.</i>

625
01:09:26,726 --> 01:09:29,200
<i>I'll hang up,
I have an appointment.</i>

626
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:32,851
<i>By the way,
I loved your story on Morii Lake.</i>

627
01:09:32,851 --> 01:09:36,018
<i>Do more location stories,
I even have an idea.</i>

628
01:09:36,018 --> 01:09:37,184
I will.

629
01:09:37,184 --> 01:09:41,268
I got 20,000 views,
up since last week.

630
01:09:41,268 --> 01:09:42,492
<i>Wow.</i>

631
01:09:46,208 --> 01:09:47,533
Hello?

632
01:09:52,208 --> 01:09:54,325
Anyone home?

633
01:10:12,667 --> 01:10:15,867
Can you please do that trick?

634
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,408
I told you he can't talk at all.

635
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:26,809
Right, I see.

636
01:10:26,809 --> 01:10:30,617
Thank you.
I'll just take a photo.

637
01:10:37,792 --> 01:10:43,117
I don't know, I think they need
someone who can speak.

638
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:54,617
I’ll go home for a nap.
I can’t keep going like this.

639
01:10:54,875 --> 01:10:57,825
Send someone else
for those lenses.

640
01:10:58,125 --> 01:11:00,200
<i>I don’t have anyone.</i>

641
01:11:00,292 --> 01:11:04,533
A driver from the <i>Canis Majoris</i> set?

642
01:11:04,917 --> 01:11:09,117
<i>I’m not interfering with their production.
You rest when you get back.</i>

643
01:11:09,250 --> 01:11:13,976
I’m worried I might fall asleep
and cause an accident.

644
01:11:13,976 --> 01:11:20,075
I don't want to end up
like those poor cashiers,

645
01:11:20,333 --> 01:11:23,783
who died in that minibus accident.

646
01:11:25,208 --> 01:11:26,908
<i>Think positive!</i>

647
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,700
<i>Have a Red Bull,
or pull over for half an hour.</i>

648
01:11:30,167 --> 01:11:34,992
I’m not sleeping in the car,
I can’t. I just can’t.

649
01:11:35,083 --> 01:11:37,950
<i>- There’s no pleasing you, I swear.</i>
- OK bye!

650
01:11:38,792 --> 01:11:40,158
Fuck you!

651
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:52,742
What the...

652
01:12:46,375 --> 01:12:47,825
Forward!

653
01:12:51,917 --> 01:12:54,617
- Forward?
- Forward!

654
01:13:25,500 --> 01:13:27,018
<i>Can you fall in love in traffic?</i>

655
01:13:27,018 --> 01:13:30,768
<i>We look forward to hearing your story
after the next track. Call us...</i>

656
01:13:30,768 --> 01:13:34,643
<i>Already a caller
wants to tell us their love story!</i>

657
01:13:34,643 --> 01:13:36,184
<i>Hello, who are we talking to?</i>

658
01:13:36,184 --> 01:13:38,684
<i>Come on,
say for our listeners to hear too.</i>

659
01:13:38,684 --> 01:13:44,617
<i>Hello!
People call you every morning...</i>

660
01:13:56,042 --> 01:14:00,893
<i>...As of today, I'm a free mac
This office chair's ruined my back</i>

661
01:14:00,893 --> 01:14:06,226
<i>While you built your dominion
On the one deathless criterion</i>

662
01:14:06,226 --> 01:14:11,408
<i>Work, work, round the clock,
Work, work, no time to talk...</i>

663
01:14:32,458 --> 01:14:35,492
PRIVATE PROPERTY

664
01:15:33,250 --> 01:15:38,726
- So, who's Bobiță fucking today?
- Every slut in town!

665
01:15:38,726 --> 01:15:42,283
<i>- I'm Angela, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.</i>

666
01:15:42,583 --> 01:15:46,158
You're killing me with
that get up, I'm addicted.

667
01:15:46,158 --> 01:15:48,434
Andrei says they're too vulgar.

668
01:15:48,434 --> 01:15:53,825
Oh, how delicate!
Anyway, I'm dead tired.

669
01:15:54,167 --> 01:15:57,408
- I'm here for some lenses.
- Here.

670
01:15:58,583 --> 01:16:03,184
- How is it here?
- Lots of overtime, otherwise OK.

671
01:16:03,184 --> 01:16:06,268
- Lots of green screen shooting.
- What's it about?

672
01:16:06,268 --> 01:16:07,492
<i>Action!</i>

673
01:16:22,625 --> 01:16:24,033
<i>Cut, cut, cut!</i>

674
01:16:25,625 --> 01:16:26,867
<i>God!</i>

675
01:16:27,292 --> 01:16:29,184
<i>So, blankets gone!</i>

676
01:16:29,184 --> 01:16:32,518
<i>I said it before, take the blankets
don't bring them back.</i>

677
01:16:32,518 --> 01:16:34,450
<i>Mask off, everybody.</i>

678
01:16:36,458 --> 01:16:38,851
<i>And we need more energy, look at this!</i>

679
01:16:38,851 --> 01:16:41,867
<i>It's a monster,
it can eat you! Yeah?</i>

680
01:16:41,867 --> 01:16:44,184
<i>So you have to be scared,
fight for your life!</i>

681
01:16:44,184 --> 01:16:46,783
More energy.
Hey, masks off!

682
01:16:50,583 --> 01:16:52,226
<i>Now she films here?</i>

683
01:16:52,226 --> 01:16:55,976
<i>Dr Boll, she's a colleague of mine,
she works here in another production.</i>

684
01:16:55,976 --> 01:16:57,059
<i>OK, OK.</i>

685
01:16:57,059 --> 01:17:00,018
<i>I just came to pick up some lenses,
I'm Angela Răducanu.</i>

686
01:17:00,018 --> 01:17:01,809
<i>- Not our lenses!
- No, no.</i>

687
01:17:01,809 --> 01:17:05,242
<i>It's from another project.
I just wanted to see...</i>

688
01:17:05,792 --> 01:17:09,658
<i>I saw a clip with you on YouTube
when you were...</i>

689
01:17:09,917 --> 01:17:12,976
<i>beating the shit out of some film critics!</i>

690
01:17:12,976 --> 01:17:14,393
<i>Absolutely!</i>

691
01:17:14,393 --> 01:17:16,976
<i>- Why did you do that?
- I hated them.</i>

692
01:17:16,976 --> 01:17:20,283
<i>They were trashing my films,
they were not even looking my films.</i>

693
01:17:20,283 --> 01:17:24,268
<i>You know, I shot 30 films
and they watched two.</i>

694
01:17:24,268 --> 01:17:26,934
<i>And then I only got bad reviews
for all my films.</i>

695
01:17:26,934 --> 01:17:29,226
<i>So I said "Look, guys,
if you want to destroy me,</i>

696
01:17:29,226 --> 01:17:31,101
<i>I'll destroy you in the ring."</i>

697
01:17:31,101 --> 01:17:33,783
<i>And then they came
and I smashed them.</i>

698
01:17:35,167 --> 01:17:37,617
<i>That is history of cinema.</i>

699
01:17:38,708 --> 01:17:42,101
<i>Yeah, but I hope my films
are also, in a way, history of cinema,</i>

700
01:17:42,101 --> 01:17:44,658
<i>not only my boxing
fights against the critics.</i>

701
01:17:44,658 --> 01:17:48,351
<i>But it was fun, and a lot of directors
actually gratulated me to it.</i>

702
01:17:48,351 --> 01:17:52,283
<i>They said "Look, I really wanted
to do the same, but I cannot box."</i>

703
01:17:52,958 --> 01:17:56,408
<i>I saw your film</i>
Assault on Wall Street <i>and,</i>

704
01:17:56,542 --> 01:18:01,476
<i>and you know, sometimes I have the envy
to take the gun and do the same thing.</i>

705
01:18:01,476 --> 01:18:04,226
<i>With my boss, for example.
Don't tell him!</i>

706
01:18:04,226 --> 01:18:08,492
<i>I also do some small movies
with this filter and I post on Instagram.</i>

707
01:18:08,708 --> 01:18:11,934
<i>It's horrible!
It's like</i> Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde <i>here.</i>

708
01:18:11,934 --> 01:18:13,200
<i>Yes.</i>

709
01:18:13,542 --> 01:18:16,601
<i>Do you agree to make
a small movie with me?</i>

710
01:18:16,601 --> 01:18:18,242
<i>OK, OK.</i>

711
01:18:18,242 --> 01:18:22,184
<i>Hello, I am here with Dr. Uwe Boll,</i>

712
01:18:22,184 --> 01:18:24,851
<i>and to all our haters,</i>

713
01:18:24,851 --> 01:18:27,893
<i>I tell them,
we tell them to fuck off!</i>

714
01:18:27,893 --> 01:18:29,809
<i>- Fuck off!
- Just fuck off!</i>

715
01:18:29,809 --> 01:18:31,643
<i>- Fuck you, also.
- Yeah.</i>

716
01:18:31,643 --> 01:18:33,492
<i>- And fucking...
- Fuck you!</i>

717
01:18:33,958 --> 01:18:35,242
<i>Totally.</i>

718
01:18:35,667 --> 01:18:37,658
<i>Sir, we are seconds away.</i>

719
01:18:37,958 --> 01:18:40,143
<i>- Seconds or minutes?
- Seconds.</i>

720
01:18:40,143 --> 01:18:41,950
<i>Perfect! Yeah.</i>

721
01:18:42,375 --> 01:18:46,658
<i>So get it ready, I'll turn my chair
and let's shoot the next one.</i>

722
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:50,559
<i>You mentioned the writer
Robert Louis Stevenson.</i>

723
01:18:50,559 --> 01:18:52,143
<i>You know how he died?</i>

724
01:18:52,143 --> 01:18:54,934
- <i>From</i> Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde?
<i>- Exactly, yes.</i>

725
01:18:54,934 --> 01:19:00,893
<i>He had a brain haemorrhage,
and his brain was in blood,</i>

726
01:19:00,893 --> 01:19:03,559
<i>and he started hallucinating and said</i>

727
01:19:03,559 --> 01:19:07,184
<i>"My face is transforming!
My face is transforming!"</i>

728
01:19:07,184 --> 01:19:09,492
<i>Then he collapsed, dead.</i>

729
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:13,825
I'm looking for
a good spot for a video.

730
01:19:13,958 --> 01:19:16,351
Can I be in it?

731
01:19:16,351 --> 01:19:19,200
Sure, let me find a spot.

732
01:19:19,458 --> 01:19:23,492
Bobiță Unforgiven here
from the Wild West!

733
01:19:23,492 --> 01:19:28,934
Just mined some 14-carat gold
and found this Pocahontas here.

734
01:19:28,934 --> 01:19:30,184
Hi!

735
01:19:30,184 --> 01:19:35,075
After I fucked her mouth
and explained a few things

736
01:19:36,625 --> 01:19:38,184
about Romania,

737
01:19:38,184 --> 01:19:41,408
she said this, in her Indian language -

738
01:19:41,583 --> 01:19:44,768
It's applying the filter on you.

739
01:19:44,768 --> 01:19:48,242
She says "A cunt is like four countries:

740
01:19:48,242 --> 01:19:52,518
"Wet like the UK,
split in two like Korea,

741
01:19:52,518 --> 01:19:57,117
bloody like the Wild West
and glad to be fucked, like Romania!"

742
01:21:13,083 --> 01:21:15,158
<i>A very great and courageous man.</i>

743
01:21:17,333 --> 01:21:21,908
Why's everyone crying?
No one's died.

744
01:21:24,542 --> 01:21:26,783
<i>Here's looking at you, kid.</i>

745
01:21:57,458 --> 01:22:00,518
<i>- Long live Communism, Boss!
- Right, Boss!</i>

746
01:22:00,518 --> 01:22:03,075
<i>Trick Ț, trick 72...</i>

747
01:22:12,667 --> 01:22:15,408
<i>Asking if I ever had a threesome.</i>

748
01:22:16,042 --> 01:22:18,658
<i>You can have sex with...</i>

749
01:22:19,583 --> 01:22:22,450
<i>Any number of people.</i>

750
01:22:23,167 --> 01:22:25,700
<i>But no, never had one.</i>

751
01:23:44,375 --> 01:23:49,075
I heard he was in Dubai
shooting an ad for Coca-Cola.

752
01:23:49,075 --> 01:23:54,325
He had dinner at the hotel,
said he was tired,

753
01:23:54,625 --> 01:23:56,367
then they found him dead.

754
01:23:56,367 --> 01:23:59,700
- Like David Hemmings.
- Who's that?

755
01:23:59,700 --> 01:24:03,101
Huge actor,
he was in Antonioni's <i>Blow-Up</i>.

756
01:24:03,101 --> 01:24:05,059
- <i>Blow Job</i>!
- That was Warhol.

757
01:24:05,059 --> 01:24:08,367
Blond, sexy guy, sensual lips.

758
01:24:09,208 --> 01:24:15,700
He was filming here about 15 years ago
and died of a heart attack on set.

759
01:24:15,917 --> 01:24:21,992
You should have heard Rică,
the camera assistant, he died of Covid.

760
01:24:22,125 --> 01:24:24,934
"I look over, the old guy's not moving.

761
01:24:24,934 --> 01:24:27,184
Grandpa, wake the fuck up!

762
01:24:27,184 --> 01:24:30,783
Nothing! Dead as a dodo, drooling."

763
01:24:32,375 --> 01:24:37,059
"Film gets cancelled one week in,
we get sent home with no pay.

764
01:24:37,059 --> 01:24:41,075
Fucking old timer
picked some time to die!

765
01:24:41,075 --> 01:24:44,783
I had dropped
another project for that one."

766
01:24:45,708 --> 01:24:47,158
Just think!

767
01:24:47,667 --> 01:24:51,533
To be the big star from <i>Blow-Up</i>,

768
01:24:51,667 --> 01:24:55,867
who uncovered a murder
just looking at a photo...

769
01:24:56,083 --> 01:25:00,492
And that Godard, committing
assisted suicide at his age.

770
01:25:01,042 --> 01:25:02,393
Like a cat!

771
01:25:02,393 --> 01:25:07,117
- What could he do, shoot himself?
- It's not a Christian thing to do.

772
01:25:08,417 --> 01:25:11,367
Doris logged on.
Hello, Doris!

773
01:25:14,042 --> 01:25:16,867
<i>She is Doris Goethe,
our boss from Austria.</i>

774
01:25:17,500 --> 01:25:20,101
<i>Doris, you heard the tragedy,</i>

775
01:25:20,101 --> 01:25:23,559
<i>that our beloved Massimiliano
died all of a sudden.</i>

776
01:25:23,559 --> 01:25:26,992
<i>- So we thought of Tibi...
- Hello.</i>

777
01:25:27,292 --> 01:25:32,143
<i>Who fortunately was eager
to embark with us on such short notice.</i>

778
01:25:32,143 --> 01:25:34,726
<i>I was absolutely
shocked when I heard the news.</i>

779
01:25:34,726 --> 01:25:38,518
<i>But let's go, because in an hour
I have to run to the airport, you know.</i>

780
01:25:38,518 --> 01:25:40,575
<i>Yes, the show must go on.</i>

781
01:25:40,875 --> 01:25:43,309
- Can you introduce yourself?
<i>- Yeah, sure.</i>

782
01:25:43,309 --> 01:25:46,867
<i>I direct television
and advertising since 2000,</i>

783
01:25:46,867 --> 01:25:52,075
<i>I have also made one feature film,
a Mircea Eliade adaptation.</i>

784
01:25:52,375 --> 01:25:55,934
<i>I have directed, basically,
more than 500 TV ads.</i>

785
01:25:55,934 --> 01:26:00,367
<i>And my most important clients
were OMV Petrom, McDonalds,</i>

786
01:26:00,542 --> 01:26:07,158
<i>Procter&Gamble, the Bonux brand,
Beer Bucegi, ING Bank and Dacia Renault.</i>

787
01:26:08,292 --> 01:26:11,200
<i>You know, I feel bad myself,
to be honest.</i>

788
01:26:11,417 --> 01:26:13,768
<i>It feels like
I have the job only because</i>

789
01:26:13,768 --> 01:26:17,158
<i>this guy, whom I enourmously
respected passed away.</i>

790
01:26:17,542 --> 01:26:18,742
<i>Come on,</i>

791
01:26:18,833 --> 01:26:20,075
<i>Come on,</i>

792
01:26:20,792 --> 01:26:22,184
<i>that is life!</i>

793
01:26:22,184 --> 01:26:23,867
<i>"Life is life!"</i>

794
01:26:25,875 --> 01:26:27,700
<i>Are you frozen?</i>

795
01:26:29,583 --> 01:26:30,726
<i>Sorry?</i>

796
01:26:30,726 --> 01:26:32,492
<i>Oh, it's OK.</i>

797
01:26:33,417 --> 01:26:35,700
<i>Yeah, you know, it's like...</i>

798
01:26:35,833 --> 01:26:40,143
<i>Of course we can have our success
only because the others died.</i>

799
01:26:40,143 --> 01:26:45,934
<i>I mean, imagine if Goethe or Shakespeare,
you name it would be alive today.</i>

800
01:26:45,934 --> 01:26:49,492
<i>Nobody would publish,
I don't know, Elena Ferrante.</i>

801
01:27:23,583 --> 01:27:26,867
I told you to be careful
with night-time customers!

802
01:27:28,917 --> 01:27:30,867
No dilly-dallying!

803
01:27:31,333 --> 01:27:32,992
Take it all off!

804
01:27:34,333 --> 01:27:37,700
Stop it, we're not highway robbers!

805
01:27:38,042 --> 01:27:41,200
What if he had his way with Victorița?

806
01:27:45,208 --> 01:27:48,226
- Get dressed, chickie.
- Thanks, Ma'am.

807
01:27:48,226 --> 01:27:52,658
People can see you naked here.
And you don't have much to show.

808
01:27:54,750 --> 01:27:59,617
Laugh, but this will
cause you trouble.

809
01:28:07,833 --> 01:28:10,934
<i>I wanna be clear
we're not... commercials here,</i>

810
01:28:10,934 --> 01:28:14,268
<i>but films about the care
our company has for its workers.</i>

811
01:28:14,268 --> 01:28:19,434
<i>Our emphasis is on the fact that we want
our workers to respect the procedures,</i>

812
01:28:19,434 --> 01:28:21,393
<i>the rules, the regulations,</i>

813
01:28:21,393 --> 01:28:24,726
<i>to wear their protection equipment,
you know, helmets and so on,</i>

814
01:28:24,726 --> 01:28:27,367
<i>to make them aware of the dangers.</i>

815
01:28:27,792 --> 01:28:32,242
<i>Now, this man with
the face broken in half?</i>

816
01:28:32,417 --> 01:28:36,309
<i>I think it's not appropriate
to have him, it's too scary.</i>

817
01:28:36,309 --> 01:28:40,184
<i>Doris, don't worry,
we already included him out.</i>

818
01:28:40,184 --> 01:28:42,976
<i>Ah cool, I feel bad for the guy
but, you know.</i>

819
01:28:42,976 --> 01:28:46,283
<i>Yeah, too much Tod Browning's</i> Freaks.
<i>I totally agree.</i>

820
01:28:46,667 --> 01:28:48,367
<i>Yeah, no...</i>

821
01:28:49,250 --> 01:28:50,575
<i>you know,</i>

822
01:28:50,792 --> 01:28:52,893
<i>funky creatures or whatever, yeah.</i>

823
01:28:52,893 --> 01:28:55,268
<i>The way I see this small film is</i>

824
01:28:55,268 --> 01:28:58,351
<i>that these people,
who were wounded but are alive,</i>

825
01:28:58,351 --> 01:29:01,867
<i>they are survivors and
they have a story to tell</i>

826
01:29:01,867 --> 01:29:04,101
<i>and a message to tell us</i>

827
01:29:04,101 --> 01:29:06,601
<i>and especially to the other
workers, their colleagues.</i>

828
01:29:06,601 --> 01:29:09,867
<i>"Respect the rules, because
if you don't, you are fucked."</i>

829
01:29:10,583 --> 01:29:12,867
<i>This should be the focus!</i>

830
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,268
<i>Regarding the style,
I was thinking to film everything</i>

831
01:29:15,268 --> 01:29:17,184
<i>in a sequence shot, in one shot,</i>

832
01:29:17,184 --> 01:29:21,393
<i>with a wide lens, let's say
a 25mm Cooke S4 lens.</i>

833
01:29:21,393 --> 01:29:23,976
<i>This will create a feeling of reality.</i>

834
01:29:23,976 --> 01:29:27,018
<i>But also we must show the money.</i>

835
01:29:27,018 --> 01:29:29,075
<i>I mean its' production value, in the end.</i>

836
01:29:29,075 --> 01:29:33,684
<i>Yeah, that's why we'll use a gold
diffusion filter directly on the camera,</i>

837
01:29:33,684 --> 01:29:36,309
<i>so as to give it a warm, golden glow.</i>

838
01:29:36,309 --> 01:29:38,742
<i>OK. Very good.</i>

839
01:29:41,708 --> 01:29:42,934
<i>OK.</i>

840
01:29:42,934 --> 01:29:45,476
<i>So let's take a look
at the casting, now</i>

841
01:29:45,476 --> 01:29:49,283
<i>I mean the real heroes who
will be in front of the lens.</i>

842
01:29:49,375 --> 01:29:52,518
<i>Maybe Angela here
can give us all the details.</i>

843
01:29:52,518 --> 01:29:53,742
<i>Yes, sure.</i>

844
01:29:54,458 --> 01:29:55,700
<i>Hello.</i>

845
01:29:56,292 --> 01:29:59,158
<i>She is Mariana Docea,</i>

846
01:29:59,458 --> 01:30:02,408
<i>she drank something and fell.</i>

847
01:30:02,408 --> 01:30:06,476
<i>Her text will be about the responsibility
of not drinking while working.</i>

848
01:30:06,476 --> 01:30:09,283
<i>And she's also a great mother.</i>

849
01:30:09,542 --> 01:30:11,684
<i>- She looks nice!
- Yeah, she's great.</i>

850
01:30:11,684 --> 01:30:15,476
<i>Optimistic and strong, she has
a commitment for your company.</i>

851
01:30:15,476 --> 01:30:16,700
<i>Well, that's great!</i>

852
01:30:16,792 --> 01:30:20,200
<i>And she's Gypsy, so
it will show we're more inclusive.</i>

853
01:30:20,200 --> 01:30:22,184
<i>Yes, but don't forget,</i>

854
01:30:22,184 --> 01:30:25,351
<i>that for the Romanian market
this is not a good point.</i>

855
01:30:25,351 --> 01:30:26,950
<i>- Sad but true.
- Yes.</i>

856
01:30:27,500 --> 01:30:29,283
<i>Ah, well, you know better.</i>

857
01:30:29,583 --> 01:30:31,033
<i>The next one.</i>

858
01:30:31,625 --> 01:30:34,783
<i>He is the victim of an accident,</i>

859
01:30:34,958 --> 01:30:39,283
<i>- He was going out of your whorehouse...
- Warehouse!</i>

860
01:30:39,375 --> 01:30:43,059
<i>...and the barrier moved or something,
he didn't pay attention</i>

861
01:30:43,059 --> 01:30:45,617
<i>and hit his back and his head.</i>

862
01:30:45,617 --> 01:30:51,575
<i>Because he didn't wear a helmet he got
into a coma and remained half-paralysed.</i>

863
01:30:51,575 --> 01:30:56,492
<i>He's nice, I mean he's got a nice smile,
he's much younger and healthier.</i>

864
01:30:56,667 --> 01:30:59,601
<i>Very joyful, it's very moving.</i>

865
01:30:59,601 --> 01:31:01,601
<i>But he shouldn't mention Russia, though.</i>

866
01:31:01,601 --> 01:31:03,200
<i>No, no.</i>

867
01:31:03,750 --> 01:31:06,492
<i>No problem, don't worry, Doris.</i>

868
01:31:06,492 --> 01:31:08,559
<i>- Does he have a family?
- Yes.</i>

869
01:31:08,559 --> 01:31:12,601
<i>He has a mother, a daughter,
I think a wife.</i>

870
01:31:12,601 --> 01:31:15,476
<i>His father is batshit crazy,
he's Looney Tunes.</i>

871
01:31:15,476 --> 01:31:17,950
<i>They can appear in the
clip as well alongside him.</i>

872
01:31:18,083 --> 01:31:20,325
<i>Family values, I will think about it.</i>

873
01:31:20,542 --> 01:31:23,283
<i>We have a small problem.</i>

874
01:31:23,458 --> 01:31:29,742
<i>The name of the man is Ovidiu Bucă.
"Bucă" means "his ass" in Romanian.</i>

875
01:31:29,833 --> 01:31:32,950
<i>No, it's actually "half-ass".</i>

876
01:31:32,950 --> 01:31:35,200
<i>"Buttocks," "Buttock."</i>

877
01:31:36,333 --> 01:31:37,768
<i>Would that be a problem?</i>

878
01:31:37,768 --> 01:31:40,908
<i>Well, yes,
especially for the target.</i>

879
01:31:41,292 --> 01:31:45,450
<i>I mean, you see the film and
you laugh at his name of "Buttock",</i>

880
01:31:45,450 --> 01:31:47,351
<i>and you don't pay attention anymore.</i>

881
01:31:47,351 --> 01:31:51,934
<i>So what we suggest is, we use
in the testimony only his first name,</i>

882
01:31:51,934 --> 01:31:53,476
<i>- Ovidius.
- I agree.</i>

883
01:31:53,476 --> 01:31:56,184
<i>That's fine with me,
let's keep him, you know.</i>

884
01:31:56,184 --> 01:31:59,867
<i>He's more impressive,
he's got a real energy.</i>

885
01:32:00,708 --> 01:32:01,950
<i>Well,</i>

886
01:32:02,208 --> 01:32:04,809
<i>I have a message
from my boss, Mr. Hans Frank.</i>

887
01:32:04,809 --> 01:32:08,783
<i>He read the booklet too
and he wants to, here he is.</i>

888
01:32:08,783 --> 01:32:11,075
<i>- Hallo, Herr Hans Frank.
- Hello!</i>

889
01:32:13,500 --> 01:32:16,033
<i>Where is my director?</i>

890
01:32:16,583 --> 01:32:19,408
<i>Here!
Hello, Mr Hans Frank.</i>

891
01:32:19,542 --> 01:32:23,018
<i>I am Tiberiu Berbece,
I am very glad to be working for you...</i>

892
01:32:23,018 --> 01:32:26,783
<i>I have only one word for you</i>

893
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:28,242
<i>emotion!</i>

894
01:32:28,500 --> 01:32:29,825
<i>Yes.</i>

895
01:32:31,833 --> 01:32:35,367
<i>We want to use a gold diffusion filter.</i>

896
01:32:35,875 --> 01:32:37,492
- Is he out?
- Yes.

897
01:32:38,542 --> 01:32:41,101
- So he wants emotion.
- I heard "locomotion".

898
01:32:41,101 --> 01:32:42,518
No, emotion.

899
01:32:42,518 --> 01:32:45,283
<i>He means he wants a close-up.</i>

900
01:32:46,333 --> 01:32:50,825
<i>No problem, we will shoot 8K,
you can zoom in as much as you like.</i>

901
01:32:54,750 --> 01:32:55,992
<i>OK!</i>

902
01:32:56,292 --> 01:32:59,408
<i>I think we can end
this Zoom conversation now.</i>

903
01:32:59,792 --> 01:33:03,033
<i>- See you later, alligator!
- OK, bye!</i>

904
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:08,851
<i>We'll have a catering especially for you.</i>

905
01:33:08,851 --> 01:33:13,867
<i>From the company that is the official
furnisher for the royal family.</i>

906
01:33:13,867 --> 01:33:15,268
<i>OK, bye!</i>

907
01:33:15,268 --> 01:33:16,492
<i>Bye!</i>

908
01:33:17,417 --> 01:33:19,283
It was good. We survived.

909
01:33:19,417 --> 01:33:21,617
That went great.

910
01:34:10,625 --> 01:34:12,408
A book?

911
01:34:17,917 --> 01:34:21,283
Oh, <i>The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie</i>.

912
01:34:24,292 --> 01:34:27,200
- How much?
- 5 lei a piece.

913
01:34:28,250 --> 01:34:33,658
Here's 6, give me
<i>Seven Apocalyptic Years</i> too.

914
01:35:21,042 --> 01:35:25,075
Your bro bought a book
to get high-cultured!

915
01:35:28,250 --> 01:35:32,825
Here, <i>The Prime of Ass Whorrey</i>.

916
01:35:33,167 --> 01:35:36,283
It's written by some skank,

917
01:35:36,958 --> 01:35:39,226
Mooriel Spank.

918
01:35:39,226 --> 01:35:43,643
More like a wannabe skank,
who would fuck her?

919
01:35:43,643 --> 01:35:48,075
It's about how I made
that Miss into a Madam.

920
01:35:48,375 --> 01:35:53,559
I didn't take her prime fuck though,
her old cunt was dry as wood.

921
01:35:53,559 --> 01:35:57,867
I told Miss Broad-y
"Stuff some margerine up your ass!"

922
01:35:58,125 --> 01:36:04,283
Then I fucked the slut
with a maize cob...

923
01:36:06,042 --> 01:36:07,283
Sorry.

924
01:36:07,875 --> 01:36:09,867
William Faulkner style!

925
01:36:09,867 --> 01:36:14,476
I bought it off
a poor beggar in the street,

926
01:36:14,476 --> 01:36:18,783
one of the fucks
who leech off us honest citizens!

927
01:36:19,833 --> 01:36:21,492
Fuck you!

928
01:36:21,492 --> 01:36:24,283
Rodica, pleased to meet you.
Come in.

929
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:28,700
- No need to take off your shoes.
- Thank you.

930
01:36:29,167 --> 01:36:32,393
Angela, my sweet!
Come by my side!

931
01:36:32,393 --> 01:36:34,783
Thank you, I'll just sit here.

932
01:36:34,783 --> 01:36:38,367
- He wasn't feeling well, he dozed off.
- I'll wait here.

933
01:36:38,458 --> 01:36:42,575
We have to go to the fitting session,
Ms Angela is here.

934
01:36:51,417 --> 01:36:56,450
If they pay you for the recording,
can I go on that mountain trip?

935
01:36:57,625 --> 01:37:00,825
I visited India
when I worked in drilling!

936
01:37:02,375 --> 01:37:04,492
You know this one?

937
01:37:05,083 --> 01:37:08,367
All Romanian women are Hungary for it!

938
01:37:11,083 --> 01:37:13,908
What's the news on Salman Rushdie?

939
01:37:14,333 --> 01:37:17,033
- Did he die?
- I don't know.

940
01:37:17,875 --> 01:37:19,367
Might have.

941
01:37:21,583 --> 01:37:22,950
But...

942
01:37:24,875 --> 01:37:26,283
Could be.

943
01:37:27,083 --> 01:37:30,242
"'O, my shoes are Japanese, '
Gibreel sang."

944
01:37:41,083 --> 01:37:43,476
- The lift's out of order.
- It is.

945
01:37:43,476 --> 01:37:46,018
- Fuck it.
- It's the stairs, then.

946
01:37:46,018 --> 01:37:48,492
- Can I help?
- Please.

947
01:37:48,792 --> 01:37:51,684
- Can you manage?
- I'll help.

948
01:37:51,684 --> 01:37:55,700
- I'm steadying the wheels.
- Take it slow!

949
01:37:56,417 --> 01:37:57,783
Easy, easy.

950
01:37:59,625 --> 01:38:02,783
This is great for
exercising your pecs.

951
01:38:06,333 --> 01:38:07,992
You know that song...

952
01:38:11,792 --> 01:38:14,742
- "Baby, work your chest"...
- Ovidiu, stop it!

953
01:38:16,125 --> 01:38:18,075
Easy.

954
01:38:21,375 --> 01:38:23,492
- This one's lower.
- Yes, it's lower.

955
01:38:24,140 --> 01:38:26,840
Let's avoid those stones.

956
01:38:28,333 --> 01:38:32,408
- So many stones.
- Boulders!

957
01:38:38,583 --> 01:38:40,825
- Just a moment.
- Sure.

958
01:38:42,958 --> 01:38:45,825
- Can I help?
- Rodica will help.

959
01:38:48,625 --> 01:38:51,283
Let me get ready.

960
01:39:00,417 --> 01:39:02,283
We have our technique.

961
01:39:05,875 --> 01:39:07,700
Wait, not yet.

962
01:39:10,167 --> 01:39:11,408
Now?

963
01:39:12,167 --> 01:39:13,783
Let's try.

964
01:39:16,833 --> 01:39:19,700
- All good?
- Need help with the chair?

965
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,783
She'll manage, she has experience.

966

974
01:40:08,542 --> 01:40:11,200
Yes, it's that old song by Loredana.

975
01:40:11,583 --> 01:40:13,143
The Mamaia Anthem.

976
01:40:13,143 --> 01:40:16,783
I don't think he was corrupt.
He is a political prisoner.

977
01:40:16,875 --> 01:40:19,200
Could be, what do we know.

978
01:40:19,458 --> 01:40:21,950
He was all for young people and fun.

979
01:40:26,125 --> 01:40:28,200
Could you stop the music

980
01:40:28,200 --> 01:40:30,033
or turn it down?

981
01:40:30,333 --> 01:40:31,976
It's the radio.

982
01:40:31,976 --> 01:40:36,268
Sorry, but if I do
I might fall asleep at the wheel.

983
01:40:36,268 --> 01:40:37,950
I apologise.

984
01:40:38,375 --> 01:40:40,825
Mum, what's wrong with the music?

985
01:41:20,458 --> 01:41:23,075
Hi, wanna trade chewing gum?

986
01:41:23,333 --> 01:41:25,700
Mine's better than Orbit!

987
01:41:45,833 --> 01:41:48,184
I'm off, good luck
and have a pleasant evening!

988
01:41:48,184 --> 01:41:49,450
Thank you.

989
01:41:55,292 --> 01:41:58,283
I'm here by the royal train,

990
01:41:58,625 --> 01:42:04,575
with a special question
for all my fans on TikTok.

991
01:42:04,667 --> 01:42:10,783
Ernst Kantorowicz spoke about
the king's two bodies.

992
01:42:10,958 --> 01:42:16,783
Does that mean
our King Michael had two cocks?

993
01:43:03,917 --> 01:43:06,492
- What's up, baby doll?
- Great.

994
01:43:17,042 --> 01:43:19,867
Who was the old fart in that video?

995
01:43:21,042 --> 01:43:26,283
Some German director
shooting a bug-killer film here.

996
01:43:26,583 --> 01:43:30,075
Didn't he say he was a doctor?

997
01:43:30,375 --> 01:43:34,658
Doctor in film criticism, don't care.

998
01:43:34,958 --> 01:43:40,450
- You said you had a surprise.
- The surprise is I have no surprise

999
01:43:41,375 --> 01:43:44,226
and you expect one and there's none.

1000
01:43:44,226 --> 01:43:45,351
Shoot!

1001
01:43:45,351 --> 01:43:48,367
I'm off my period
and you can cum in my mouth.

1002
01:43:52,583 --> 01:43:54,367
So good, yes.

1003
01:43:59,250 --> 01:44:01,492
I love your cock!

1004
01:44:09,958 --> 01:44:12,700
- Pull over.
- Why?

1005
01:44:15,125 --> 01:44:17,242
I said pull over!

1006
01:44:24,417 --> 01:44:26,908
Why did you never tell me?

1007
01:44:41,708 --> 01:44:43,075
Gyuri!

1008
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:58,867
- What do you want?
- Wait.

1009
01:45:00,500 --> 01:45:01,867
When was it?

1010
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,783
When you stayed over
at your mother's?

1011
01:45:06,625 --> 01:45:07,908
Yes.

1012
01:45:10,208 --> 01:45:12,200
Finish in my mouth!

1013
01:45:12,375 --> 01:45:14,575
Shove it in my mouth!

1014
01:45:23,042 --> 01:45:25,700
Wait, what the fuck?

1015
01:45:26,083 --> 01:45:30,575
You shot sperm all over my dress!

1016
01:45:32,208 --> 01:45:35,075
And I need to go to the airport!

1017
01:45:35,075 --> 01:45:37,325
The airport, at this hour?

1018
01:45:38,625 --> 01:45:42,117
Some bitch coming from Austria.

1019
01:45:42,625 --> 01:45:44,018
You know what?

1020
01:45:44,018 --> 01:45:49,575
One time we were shooting
a porn film for some Danes

1021
01:45:49,875 --> 01:45:56,117
and in the middle of the scene,
the guy couldn't get it up anymore.

1022
01:45:56,375 --> 01:46:00,658
So he got up from
that hot ass under him

1023
01:46:00,658 --> 01:46:03,450
all naked and sexy as hell,

1024
01:46:03,450 --> 01:46:08,742
and to get it back up
he went on PornHub on his phone.

1025
01:46:09,083 --> 01:46:12,242
It struck me as apocalyptic.

1026
01:46:14,417 --> 01:46:21,700
- How am I supposed to show up like this?
- You can't see a thing on that glitter.

1027
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:28,143
Could you lend me 200 lei?

1028
01:46:28,143 --> 01:46:31,283
- Lost at the slot machines?
- No, man!

1029
01:46:31,708 --> 01:46:34,575
They just haven't paid me.

1030
01:46:34,667 --> 01:46:37,559
I keep having to beg
for my pay.

1031
01:46:37,559 --> 01:46:40,283
And the war's pushed prices up.

1032
01:46:40,542 --> 01:46:44,492
- On Revolut?
- Yes, thanks a lot.

1033
01:46:46,042 --> 01:46:51,575
Did you see what it says
on contactless card readers?

1034
01:46:51,708 --> 01:46:54,200
- No, what?
- "You blinked, you paid."

1035
01:46:54,333 --> 01:46:58,825
I'll be there in five,
tell her to wait at the taxi stop!

1036
01:46:59,458 --> 01:47:01,283
<i>She's there already!</i>

1037
01:47:01,583 --> 01:47:04,867
Didn't she have
check-in luggage to wait for?

1038
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:09,434
<i>- We're embarrassing ourselves!</i>
- Can't help traffic, bye!

1039
01:47:09,434 --> 01:47:10,992
Fuck off.

1040
01:47:12,708 --> 01:47:15,825
Fuck off!
Fuck your mother!

1041
01:48:02,250 --> 01:48:03,658
<i>Sorry!</i>

1042
01:48:04,125 --> 01:48:05,559
<i>Sorry, I was...</i>

1043
01:48:05,559 --> 01:48:08,059
<i>- I'm sorry, the traffic was hell.
- It's OK.</i>

1044
01:48:08,059 --> 01:48:09,450
<i>So sorry.</i>

1045
01:48:09,450 --> 01:48:11,825
<i>- So, only this luggage?
- Yeah.</i>

1046
01:48:12,042 --> 01:48:15,950
<i>- Tomorrow evening I fly to Singapore.
- Great, amazing!</i>

1047
01:48:16,208 --> 01:48:17,533
<i>Yeah...</i>

1048
01:48:19,083 --> 01:48:21,575
<i>I parked the car there.</i>

1049
01:48:37,750 --> 01:48:39,075
To Otopeni.

1050
01:48:42,708 --> 01:48:46,450
- My car was first in line!
- He's going to Otopeni.

1051
01:48:46,667 --> 01:48:48,367
You want to drive him?

1052
01:49:07,375 --> 01:49:08,575
Lucky me.

1053
01:49:11,875 --> 01:49:14,367
Another woman would have...

1054
01:49:14,875 --> 01:49:16,867
I'm not easy to scare.

1055
01:49:19,167 --> 01:49:21,450
Have you been a taxi driver long?

1056
01:49:21,450 --> 01:49:24,075
- Five years.
- Nights too?

1057
01:49:24,075 --> 01:49:25,742
You really nailed it.

1058
01:49:37,042 --> 01:49:40,283
If your wife was a taxi driver,
you'd know how it is.

1059
01:49:40,375 --> 01:49:43,075
I've never had a taxi driver wife.

1060
01:49:48,875 --> 01:49:51,492
No wife at all, in fact.

1061
01:49:53,500 --> 01:49:55,992
And I doubt I ever will.

1062
01:49:58,333 --> 01:50:00,075
Not like you need one.

1063
01:50:26,042 --> 01:50:28,950
<i>- Can I ask you something?
- Please.</i>

1064
01:50:29,750 --> 01:50:32,783
<i>Are you related with Goethe?</i>

1065
01:50:33,167 --> 01:50:35,200
<i>- The writer?
- Yes.</i>

1066
01:50:36,042 --> 01:50:39,492
<i>I'm his grand-grand-granddaughter,
so to speak.</i>

1067
01:50:39,667 --> 01:50:41,492
<i>- No way!
- Yes.</i>

1068
01:50:41,492 --> 01:50:44,492
<i>- No!
- I am, through my father.</i>

1069
01:50:44,750 --> 01:50:47,408
<i>Wow, that's so cool!</i>

1070
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:52,783
<i>Do you think that what he wrote
in Dichtung und...</i>

1071
01:50:53,917 --> 01:50:55,950
<i>Dichtung und Wahrheit.</i>

1072
01:50:56,208 --> 01:50:57,643
<i>Dichtung und Wahrheit
yeah is true</i>

1073
01:50:57,643 --> 01:51:04,325
<i>that what you wish for when you are young
you get it galore in old age?</i>

1074
01:51:04,875 --> 01:51:06,367
<i>No idea, it...</i>

1075
01:51:06,917 --> 01:51:10,908
<i>To be honest, I never read him properly.
Faust, maybe no, but...</i>

1076
01:51:11,458 --> 01:51:13,893
<i>When it's family, somehow you don't...</i>

1077
01:51:13,893 --> 01:51:16,200
<i>you don't feel like doing it.</i>

1078
01:51:16,292 --> 01:51:17,867
<i>Yeah, sure, sure.</i>

1079
01:51:20,750 --> 01:51:24,075
<i>So I hope I make it
'til I'm 70, and then...</i>

1080
01:51:24,917 --> 01:51:28,283
<i>Although I feel already very old.</i>

1081
01:51:28,708 --> 01:51:32,783
<i>And maybe he meant it
only for the Germans, who knows?</i>

1082
01:51:34,167 --> 01:51:38,268
<i>- The drivers are very aggressive here.
- Oh, yes!</i>

1083
01:51:38,268 --> 01:51:41,518
<i>A lot of idiots. They don't care!</i>

1084
01:51:41,518 --> 01:51:44,408
<i>You know, on a road to
a city called Buzău,</i>

1085
01:51:44,667 --> 01:51:49,408
<i>there are more crosses for the people
who died in accidents than kilometres.</i>

1086
01:51:49,667 --> 01:51:51,700
<i>I don't get it.</i>

1087
01:51:51,700 --> 01:51:58,200
<i>The road is like 250km long,
and there are around 600 crosses.</i>

1088
01:51:58,833 --> 01:52:00,893
<i>When someone dies in a car crash,</i>

1089
01:52:00,893 --> 01:52:03,908
<i>the relatives install
a Christian cross there.</i>

1090
01:52:04,167 --> 01:52:06,143
<i>- Oh, I see!
- Yeah.</i>

1091
01:52:06,143 --> 01:52:08,643
<i>- Horrible!
- Yes, and...</i>

1092
01:52:08,643 --> 01:52:13,018
<i>You can imagine that some crosses
have more than one person</i>

1093
01:52:13,018 --> 01:52:16,059
<i>and some dead people
don't have crosses put there,</i>

1094
01:52:16,059 --> 01:52:18,408
<i>or they're stolen or destroyed.</i>

1095
01:52:18,625 --> 01:52:20,075
<i>Why does this happen?</i>

1096
01:52:20,708 --> 01:52:23,200
<i>Because that is a one lane road</i>

1097
01:52:23,200 --> 01:52:26,101
<i>and it has an emergency lane
that's very narrow.</i>

1098
01:52:26,101 --> 01:52:30,809
<i>And people treat that narrow
emergency lane as a real lane.</i>

1099
01:52:30,809 --> 01:52:33,242
<i>Like it would be a two lane road,
which it's not.</i>

1100
01:52:33,375 --> 01:52:35,950
<i>- Sounds very stupid.
- We are.</i>

1101
01:52:36,208 --> 01:52:37,768
<i>I mean it's easy to fix,</i>

1102
01:52:37,768 --> 01:52:41,518
<i>the police should just force the people
to only drive on the legal lane.</i>

1103
01:52:41,518 --> 01:52:43,992
<i>Nobody does it, we are alone!</i>

1104
01:52:44,458 --> 01:52:48,518
<i>And to be honest,
I'm really afraid to drive on that road.</i>

1105
01:52:48,518 --> 01:52:53,992
<i>Especially since, as a PA,
I drive a lot and work extra hours.</i>

1106
01:57:02,542 --> 01:57:04,825
<i>How much do you work?</i>

1107
01:57:05,375 --> 01:57:10,283
<i>Well, when I have projects, I don't...
15-16 hours a day,</i>

1108
01:57:10,667 --> 01:57:13,367
<i>sometimes even 20 hours.</i>

1109
01:57:13,625 --> 01:57:15,992
<i>We are exploited. Slaves.</i>

1110
01:57:20,292 --> 01:57:23,575
<i>I hope for this project you weren't
forced to work extra hours.</i>

1111
01:57:23,875 --> 01:57:29,117
<i>Oh no, for this one no, of course not!
Only 8 hours, don't worry.</i>

1112
01:57:29,625 --> 01:57:32,700
<i>But otherwise,
some foreign productions</i>

1113
01:57:32,700 --> 01:57:36,226
<i>film or television, are the worst!</i>

1114
01:57:36,226 --> 01:57:38,075
<i>They treat us like cattle.</i>

1115
01:57:39,750 --> 01:57:45,617
<i>But maybe robots and Tesla or other
self-driving cars will solve this problem.</i>

1116
01:57:46,583 --> 01:57:49,825
<i>Maybe, but can we trust their software?</i>

1117
01:57:49,917 --> 01:57:51,825
<i>Self-driving cars, I mean...</i>

1118
01:57:52,708 --> 01:57:54,950
<i>I guess so, why not?</i>

1119
01:57:55,083 --> 01:57:57,700
<i>Well, let's imagine this situation.</i>

1120
01:57:58,333 --> 01:58:02,325
<i>A self-driving car approaches
a child who got on the road.</i>

1121
01:58:02,667 --> 01:58:05,617
<i>And the only way not to kill the child</i>

1122
01:58:05,750 --> 01:58:10,976
<i>is to turn left and throw
the car and the driver into a wall</i>

1123
01:58:10,976 --> 01:58:12,825
<i>and kill the driver.</i>

1124
01:58:12,958 --> 01:58:17,867
<i>What decision the software takes?
It will kill the child or the driver?</i>

1125
01:58:20,625 --> 01:58:22,617
<i>I honestly don't know.</i>

1126
01:58:24,292 --> 01:58:27,408
<i>I just read a study on the plane,</i>

1127
01:58:27,917 --> 01:58:31,200
<i>saying that Romanians
are the poorest in Europe.</i>

1128
01:58:31,200 --> 01:58:33,976
<i>6 times more than the European average.</i>

1129
01:58:33,976 --> 01:58:37,908
<i>I don't know if it's about
the European Union or the whole of Europe.</i>

1130
01:58:38,625 --> 01:58:41,700
<i>Well, I think it's about the EU.</i>

1131
01:58:41,875 --> 01:58:44,950
<i>Otherwise the Albanians are more poor.</i>

1132
01:58:45,125 --> 01:58:48,742
<i>- More primitive, too.
- Oh, yeah. Sure.</i>

1133
01:58:55,417 --> 01:58:59,992
<i>Can I ask you something delicate?
But please don't get me wrong.</i>

1134
01:59:02,042 --> 01:59:03,283
<i>OK.</i>

1135
01:59:04,375 --> 01:59:09,367
<i>Is it true that your company is actually
destroying the Romanian forest for wood?</i>

1136
01:59:09,500 --> 01:59:11,783
<i>Or is just a rumour?</i>

1137
01:59:12,042 --> 01:59:15,367
<i>Wood for the furniture factories,
of course.</i>

1138
01:59:16,333 --> 01:59:20,200
<i>I work in the marketing department,
I have no idea.</i>

1139
01:59:22,583 --> 01:59:25,367
<i>I don't think so,
I've never heard of it.</i>

1140
01:59:27,708 --> 01:59:31,434
<i>Anyway, if it happens,
it's because Romania allows it.</i>

1141
01:59:31,434 --> 01:59:34,992
<i>If the Romanians would say no,
it wouldn't happen.</i>

1142
01:59:35,292 --> 01:59:39,075
<i>Yeah, a lot of corruption,
politicians corrupted.</i>

1143
01:59:40,042 --> 01:59:41,575
<i>Probably.</i>

1144
01:59:43,583 --> 01:59:46,033
<i>Citizens who accept, as well.</i>

1145
01:59:47,458 --> 01:59:50,143
<i>But it's better for us to
just do our job, and that's it.</i>

1146
01:59:50,143 --> 01:59:53,742
<i>That's the secret of happiness.
"Wu wei", as the Taoists say.</i>

1147
01:59:54,375 --> 01:59:56,351
<i>Meaning "all flowing".</i>

1148
01:59:56,351 --> 01:59:59,825
<i>We should flow with the world,
we shouldn't force.</i>

1149
02:00:06,583 --> 02:00:09,893
<i>Tell me, do you like
this "manele" music?</i>

1150
02:00:09,893 --> 02:00:12,309
<i>This turbo-folk or...</i>

1151
02:00:12,309 --> 02:00:13,575
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

1152
02:00:13,708 --> 02:00:17,700
<i>Sometimes, yes.
I like all music, why?</i>

1153
02:00:18,083 --> 02:00:20,393
<i>Could you play me some? Manele?</i>

1154
02:00:20,393 --> 02:00:22,117
<i>Oh, sure!</i>

1155
02:00:22,250 --> 02:00:25,533
<i>My favourite is</i> Sandu Ciorbă<i>. Soup!</i>

1156
02:00:26,083 --> 02:00:31,283
Ia de-aici că n-ai servici, <i>meaning
"Take this 'cause you don't have a job".</i>

1157
02:00:52,167 --> 02:00:53,867
<i>It's pretty cool.</i>

1158
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:55,700
<i>He's from Transylvania.</i>

1159
02:01:00,917 --> 02:01:04,492
<i>Take this 'cause you don't have a job</i>

1160
02:01:06,958 --> 02:01:10,367
<i>Just make sure you don't fall down...</i>

1161
02:01:43,458 --> 02:01:44,742
<i>Wow!</i>

1162
02:01:44,875 --> 02:01:47,867
<i>So huge! Very impressive.</i>

1163
02:01:48,083 --> 02:01:51,518
<i>Was there something here before
or was this an empty field?</i>

1164
02:01:51,518 --> 02:01:54,601
<i>No no, as far as I know
it was a neighbourhood.</i>

1165
02:01:54,601 --> 02:01:56,992
<i>"Uranus" or something like that.</i>

1166
02:01:57,208 --> 02:02:01,351
<i>Ceaușescu demolished it
to make this huge palace.</i>

1167
02:02:01,351 --> 02:02:03,242
<i>Second after Pentagon.</i>

1168
02:02:03,667 --> 02:02:05,992
<i>What happened to the people living there?</i>

1169
02:02:05,992 --> 02:02:09,101
<i>Their houses were put down, destroyed,</i>

1170
02:02:09,101 --> 02:02:12,492
<i>and they were moved
to some block of flats.</i>

1171
02:02:13,083 --> 02:02:16,992
<i>Ceaușescu was an imbecile.
He destroyed Romania.</i>

1172
02:02:19,500 --> 02:02:22,075
To Uranus, please.

1173
02:02:27,375 --> 02:02:30,492
Maybe a baby
would have saved your marriage.

1174
02:02:30,667 --> 02:02:32,200
Yeah, right.

1175
02:02:32,792 --> 02:02:36,117
I was four months pregnant
when he beat me up.

1176
02:02:36,667 --> 02:02:39,518
Enough about me,
it's not interesting.

1177
02:02:39,518 --> 02:02:42,617
I find it very interesting.

1178
02:02:45,375 --> 02:02:47,893
You don't regret
not having children?

1179
02:02:47,893 --> 02:02:51,059
I only regret
what I have done.

1180
02:02:51,059 --> 02:02:53,117
It's not too late, though.

1181
02:02:53,500 --> 02:02:58,200
At my age?
Last thing I need!

1182
02:02:58,500 --> 02:03:01,658
Why?
You still look young.

1183
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,617
Your mother is amazing!

1184
02:03:06,875 --> 02:03:09,992
Stop there, at the iron gate.

1185
02:03:20,458 --> 02:03:21,742
<i>Interesting.</i>

<i>"More nothing".</i>

1195
02:04:21,292 --> 02:04:24,434
I can't go on like this, Mr. Vladimir.

B) OVIDIU: RAW MATERIAL

1198
02:04:36,333 --> 02:04:42,408
"NOW THAT YOUR HEAD BROKE DOWN THE WALL,
WHAT WILL YOU DO IN YOUR NEW CELL?"

1199
02:04:42,708 --> 02:04:48,101
Hello, I am Ovidiu Bucă
and on the 24th of November 2020,

1200
02:04:48,101 --> 02:04:50,351
after 17 hours of constant work...

1201
02:04:50,351 --> 02:04:53,075
<i>Ovidiu, no need for your family name.</i>

1202
02:04:53,750 --> 02:04:55,992
- <i>"Ovidiu" will do.</i>
- OK.

1203
02:04:56,167 --> 02:05:00,059
<i>It's friendlier and
it makes you think of the poet.</i>

1204
02:05:00,059 --> 02:05:01,700
- <i>The Roman.</i>
- Exactly.

1205
02:05:01,875 --> 02:05:04,575
Tristia <i>and</i> Ex Ponto<i>!
"Carmen et error"!</i>

1206
02:05:06,292 --> 02:05:09,226
<i>So the audience see you
as one of them.</i>

1207
02:05:09,226 --> 02:05:11,283
- I see.
- <i>As a friend.</i>

1208
02:05:11,458 --> 02:05:15,908
Lovely name, too, Bucă.
I'll have it changed when I turn 18.

1209
02:05:16,167 --> 02:05:18,143
If he took his wife's name...

1210
02:05:18,143 --> 02:05:20,242
<i>It's your name, so what.</i>

1211
02:05:20,583 --> 02:05:23,143
<i>Just a bit funny
when you first hear it.</i>

1212
02:05:23,143 --> 02:05:26,783
<i>My name means "ram",
so I know what it's like.</i>

1213
02:05:26,958 --> 02:05:30,283
<i>Also, Ovidiu, try to articulate.</i>

1214
02:05:30,283 --> 02:05:34,617
- I'll do my best.
- <i>Given the circumstances, of course.</i>

1215
02:05:34,958 --> 02:05:38,658
<i>Though the event is tragic for him,</i>

1216
02:05:38,792 --> 02:05:42,283
<i>we want to show him as a fighter.</i>

1217
02:05:42,283 --> 02:05:43,617
<i>Action!</i>

1218
02:05:44,208 --> 02:05:46,643
Hello, I am Ovidiu.

1219
02:05:46,643 --> 02:05:52,117
On the 24th of November 2020,
I had worked non-stop for 17 hours.

1220
02:05:52,375 --> 02:05:55,518
We had a furniture order
to fill for Russia and France,

1221
02:05:55,518 --> 02:05:58,934
the holidays were coming
and we were all working hard.

1222
02:05:58,934 --> 02:06:03,908
I came out and walked
towards the parking lot,

1223
02:06:04,083 --> 02:06:06,492
to my car, so I could go home.

1224
02:06:06,625 --> 02:06:11,992
The lighting outside here is poor,
it's pitch black at night.

1225
02:06:12,833 --> 02:06:14,242
Suddenly,

1226
02:06:14,958 --> 02:06:19,617
an old Dacia 1310 came this way.

1227
02:06:20,042 --> 02:06:24,783
The driver didn't see that barrier
and drove into it.

1228
02:06:25,417 --> 02:06:30,533
It's not marked,
just a rusty metal bar on a cylinder.

1229
02:06:30,833 --> 02:06:34,992
The car sent the bar flying
and it hit me in the head.

1230
02:06:36,292 --> 02:06:40,309
I was in a coma for
one year and one month.

1231
02:06:40,309 --> 02:06:41,783
Hey, man.

1232
02:06:41,783 --> 02:06:46,908
I woke up to find myself
paralysed from the waist down.

1233
02:06:47,083 --> 02:06:52,033
My back was all
red raw from bedsores.

1234
02:06:52,033 --> 02:06:55,783
<i>...those weeds and the rubbish.</i>

1235
02:06:55,917 --> 02:06:57,783
<i>Right! Well done.</i>

1236
02:06:58,083 --> 02:07:00,325
<i>Very good, very touching.</i>

1237
02:07:00,325 --> 02:07:05,492
<i>We need to take off
that vodka ad and move the lorry.</i>

1238
02:07:05,875 --> 02:07:08,184
<i>And he can't mention Russia.</i>

1239
02:07:08,184 --> 02:07:10,408
<i>Your company still
has branches in Russia.</i>

1240
02:07:10,583 --> 02:07:15,059
<i>Because we'd have to fire people
and we care about our employees.</i>

1241
02:07:15,059 --> 02:07:17,658
<i>We're neutral, like Switzerland.</i>

1242
02:07:19,250 --> 02:07:22,325
<i>We need to get rid of that banner.</i>

1243
02:07:22,750 --> 02:07:26,783
<i>And move out that Kuchnie lorry.</i>

1244
02:07:44,417 --> 02:07:47,658
- So don't mention Russia.
- Only France?

1245
02:08:02,333 --> 02:08:04,283
<i>Go get that thing.</i>

1246
02:08:04,283 --> 02:08:06,283
<i>- What?
- The frame.</i>

1247
02:08:12,500 --> 02:08:15,518
- You know what this is?
- No.

1248
02:08:15,518 --> 02:08:18,575
- A nuclear fallout shelter.
- Really?

1249
02:08:20,708 --> 02:08:23,658
The door is welded shut.

1250
02:08:24,917 --> 02:08:27,992
Besides, how many people could it fit?

1251
02:08:28,583 --> 02:08:31,492
Not enough
for the whole country!

1252
02:08:34,958 --> 02:08:37,643
<i>- Making any new films?
- This one.</i>

1253
02:08:37,643 --> 02:08:42,492
<i>I meant a feature, something serious,
not corporate stuff.</i>

1254
02:08:42,708 --> 02:08:45,018
<i>Everything is for corporations now.</i>

1255
02:08:45,018 --> 02:08:49,908
<i>This shot looks like a Lumière film.</i>

1256
02:08:50,083 --> 02:08:55,242
<i>The Lumière brothers' first film,
with the workers leaving the factory,</i>

1257
02:08:55,458 --> 02:08:59,309
<i>is considered a documentary,
but that was only the first take,</i>

1258
02:08:59,309 --> 02:09:02,658
<i>when they filmed workers
actually leaving the factory,</i>

1259
02:09:02,833 --> 02:09:06,908
<i>the brothers didn't like it,
so the second take was directed.</i>

1260
02:09:07,042 --> 02:09:09,783
<i>They made them come out again.</i>

1261
02:09:09,783 --> 02:09:13,893
<i>So fiction was there from the start,
as were ads and corporate films.</i>

1262
02:09:13,893 --> 02:09:18,575
<i>Their footage was also
an ad for the Lumière factory.</i>

1263
02:09:18,958 --> 02:09:24,700
<i>And in 1897, Meliès had already
shot a Bornibus mustard ad.</i>

1264
02:09:26,125 --> 02:09:29,450
<i>- What mustard was that?
- Bornibus.</i>

1265
02:09:29,708 --> 02:09:32,268
<i>- I'd like to see it.
- It's sadly lost.</i>

1266
02:09:32,268 --> 02:09:37,408
<i>Only a photo from the shoot survived.
Photos last longer than films.</i>

1267
02:09:37,958 --> 02:09:42,033
<i>But yes,
I might do a series for Pro TV.</i>

1268
02:09:42,033 --> 02:09:45,367
<i>An adaptation of
Scorsese's The Irishman,</i>

1269
02:09:45,625 --> 02:09:49,559
<i>with old Romanian gangsters
working for the Russians.</i>

1270
02:09:49,559 --> 02:09:52,242
<i>Ex-Communist Secret Service agents.</i>

1271
02:09:53,125 --> 02:09:55,768
<i>Bobiță says hi!</i>

1272
02:09:55,768 --> 02:09:57,684
<i>It's very hot today!</i>

1273
02:09:57,684 --> 02:10:02,893
<i>The city is full of
naked asses and tits today,</i>

1274
02:10:02,893 --> 02:10:07,033
<i>I've had it!
Stay the fuck inside!</i>

1275
02:10:07,033 --> 02:10:11,393
<i>Can't look this way,
can't look that way,</i>

1276
02:10:11,393 --> 02:10:14,893
<i>where the fuck should I look
if your tits and ass are out?</i>

1277
02:10:14,893 --> 02:10:16,658
<i>Fucking sluts!</i>

1278
02:10:17,292 --> 02:10:20,617
<i>Man, you're so vulgar
with this Bobiță!</i>

1279
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:24,059
<i>I criticise by way of extreme caricature!</i>

1280
02:10:24,059 --> 02:10:26,450
<i>I'm like Charlie Hebdo, sucker!</i>

1281
02:10:43,167 --> 02:10:49,143
<i>They say 14,000 children were sent
in front of the troops to set off mines</i>

1282
02:10:49,143 --> 02:10:52,200
<i>during the war between Iran and Iraq.</i>

1283
02:11:24,333 --> 02:11:26,283
<i>More to the left.</i>

1284
02:11:38,542 --> 02:11:39,559
<i>Sound.</i>

1285
02:11:39,559 --> 02:11:40,867
<i>Rolling.</i>

1286
02:11:42,958 --> 02:11:44,908
<i>- Set.
- Action!</i>

1287
02:11:44,908 --> 02:11:47,867
Hello, my name is Ovidiu

1288
02:11:47,958 --> 02:11:53,700
and on the 24th of November 2020,
I had worked non-stop for 17 hours

1289
02:11:53,833 --> 02:11:56,908
to fill a furniture order for France.

1290
02:11:57,333 --> 02:12:00,783
The holidays were coming
and we were all working hard.

1291
02:12:00,783 --> 02:12:04,408
I came out of the warehouse
and walked to the exit,

1292
02:12:04,583 --> 02:12:09,033
to get my car from
the parking lot and go home.

1293
02:12:09,208 --> 02:12:15,200
The lighting outside here is poor,
it's pitch black at night.

1294
02:12:15,958 --> 02:12:20,658
Suddenly,
an old Dacia 1310 came this way.

1295
02:12:21,042 --> 02:12:25,950
The driver didn't see that barrier
and drove into it.

1296
02:12:26,792 --> 02:12:32,033
It's not marked,
just a rusty metal bar on a cylinder.

1297
02:12:33,375 --> 02:12:37,533
The car hit it, sent it flying,
it hit me in the head.

1298
02:12:38,792 --> 02:12:43,033
I was in a coma
for a year and one month.

1299
02:12:44,375 --> 02:12:49,242
I woke up to find myself
paralysed from the waist down.

1300
02:12:50,042 --> 02:12:56,075
My back was all
red raw from the bedsores.

1301
02:12:56,958 --> 02:13:00,934
I'd like to urge everyone
to be careful at work,

1302
02:13:00,934 --> 02:13:03,158
so incidents like this
don't happen again.

1303
02:13:03,917 --> 02:13:05,059
<i>Cut!</i>

1304
02:13:05,059 --> 02:13:07,200
<i>Bravo, Ovidiu.</i>

1305
02:13:07,458 --> 02:13:09,559
Will we repeat this a lot?

1306
02:13:09,559 --> 02:13:12,184
It depends on what
you consider "a lot".

1307
02:13:12,184 --> 02:13:17,559
Chaplin is famous for
the 800 takes he did for <i>City Lights</i>.

1308
02:13:17,559 --> 02:13:19,643
- What?
- 800, Madam.

1309
02:13:19,643 --> 02:13:22,559
For one shot,
because, wait for it,

1310
02:13:22,559 --> 02:13:25,434
he didn't like how
Virginia Cherrill spoke.

1311
02:13:25,434 --> 02:13:27,492
In a silent film!

1312
02:13:28,208 --> 02:13:29,684
<i>I like Buster Keaton!</i>

1313
02:13:29,684 --> 02:13:33,658
Ovidiu, you shouldn't
mention the overtime.

1314
02:13:33,917 --> 02:13:37,825
Or the makeshift, rusty barrier.

1315
02:13:38,167 --> 02:13:42,033
You can see it's still rusty,
how can I say it wasn't?

1316
02:13:55,042 --> 02:13:56,533
Doina!

1317
02:13:57,083 --> 02:14:00,283
This thing really is dangerous.

1318
02:14:01,333 --> 02:14:03,867
It's a heavy iron bar!

1319
02:14:04,542 --> 02:14:07,309
If a car hits it, it will fly again.

1320
02:14:07,309 --> 02:14:09,059
<i>I'll tell them.</i>

1321
02:14:09,059 --> 02:14:13,283
<i>I'm in marketing,
I have nothing to do with it.</i>

1322
02:14:13,283 --> 02:14:16,158
I know, but this man...

1323
02:14:16,333 --> 02:14:20,059
<i>It's Communist heritage,
we didn't put it here.</i>

1324
02:14:20,059 --> 02:14:23,893
<i>The building is an interwar jewel.
Those cornices!</i>

1325
02:14:23,893 --> 02:14:27,158
<i>The building, yes.
The barrier is from Communist times.</i>

1326
02:14:27,158 --> 02:14:29,434
<i>But it's been 33 years
since the Revolution!</i>

1327
02:14:29,434 --> 02:14:34,992
<i>And the place
still isn't lit properly at night.</i>

1328
02:14:36,083 --> 02:14:39,783
<i>Only that block gives some light.</i>

1329
02:14:40,208 --> 02:14:43,643
I'm glad you told me,
I'll forward this.

1330
02:14:43,643 --> 02:14:45,643
It will be fixed.

1331
02:14:45,643 --> 02:14:46,809
Right!

1332
02:14:46,809 --> 02:14:52,059
It's very important for us
that Ovidiu mentions

1333
02:14:52,059 --> 02:14:54,518
he wasn't wearing his safety helmet

1334
02:14:54,518 --> 02:14:57,559
and advise his coworkers
and everyone watching

1335
02:14:57,559 --> 02:14:59,783
to wear their safety helmet.

1336
02:14:59,783 --> 02:15:03,643
<i>Just like we had to wear
a mask to not get Covid.</i>

1337
02:15:03,643 --> 02:15:06,867
<i>The safety helmet is the same, Mr Bucă!</i>

1338
02:15:06,958 --> 02:15:08,518
What Covid?

1339
02:15:08,518 --> 02:15:13,992
But the helmet wasn't compulsory,
that's why we sued.

1340
02:15:14,208 --> 02:15:18,434
<i>The regulations say
it's compulsory everywhere.</i>

1341
02:15:18,434 --> 02:15:23,158
<i>It's in the occupational safety
regulations you signed.</i>

1342
02:15:23,292 --> 02:15:27,059
<i>- It includes the courtyard.</i>
- I was by the exit!

1343
02:15:27,059 --> 02:15:31,158
<i>But still in the courtyard.</i>

1344
02:15:31,158 --> 02:15:35,992
- I was two metres from the barrier!
<i>- But in the courtyard!</i>

1345
02:15:35,992 --> 02:15:38,851
<i>Could be a micron or a light-year!</i>

1346
02:15:38,851 --> 02:15:43,825
Excuse me, but we're still
waiting for the court's decision.

1347
02:15:44,208 --> 02:15:47,934
Sure, the rules may say so,
but it's ridiculous,

1348
02:15:47,934 --> 02:15:53,158
wearing the helmet out here,
by the exit, with no falling hazards!

1349
02:15:53,458 --> 02:15:59,492
If the barrier was properly attached
and made of plastic, not 30 kilos of iron,

1350
02:15:59,667 --> 02:16:04,408
if it was painted visibly,
if there was even a little lighting,

1351
02:16:04,542 --> 02:16:06,684
the driver would have seen it.

1352
02:16:06,684 --> 02:16:09,434
Or, anyway,
this wouldn't have happened.

1353
02:16:09,434 --> 02:16:11,559
So don't ask us to lie.

1354
02:16:11,559 --> 02:16:13,559
<i>We're not asking you to lie!</i>

1355
02:16:13,559 --> 02:16:18,033
<i>Just don't say things detrimental
to the company paying you.</i>

1356
02:16:18,208 --> 02:16:22,533
<i>1,000 euro for one day's shooting
is no small thing.</i>

1357
02:16:22,833 --> 02:16:29,033
<i>We're doing this to help people,
not to be seen in a bad light.</i>

1358
02:16:29,033 --> 02:16:31,684
<i>He puts himself in a bad light.</i>

1359
02:16:31,684 --> 02:16:37,367
<i>If you were so unhappy with the barrier,
why didn't you speak out?</i>

1360
02:16:37,583 --> 02:16:41,450
<i>Do anything to change things?</i>

1361
02:16:41,583 --> 02:16:44,408
<i>Did you send a memo
to the management?</i>

1362
02:16:46,917 --> 02:16:50,908
<i>No, so there's no point complaining now.</i>

1363
02:16:51,417 --> 02:16:53,059
I will only speak the truth.

1364
02:16:53,059 --> 02:16:56,684
<i>Then why won't you say
you weren't wearing a helmet?</i>

1365
02:16:56,684 --> 02:17:00,768
- It's not important.
<i>- Of course it is, Mr Bucă!</i>

1366
02:17:00,768 --> 02:17:05,934
<i>With a helmet, you'd be fine,
or you'd only have light injuries.</i>

1367
02:17:05,934 --> 02:17:08,033
- You can't know that.
<i>- Nonsense!</i>

1368
02:17:08,033 --> 02:17:11,934
<i>It stands to reason,
that's why the helmet is compulsory.</i>

1369
02:17:11,934 --> 02:17:14,408
<i>As for the overtime work,</i>

1370
02:17:14,583 --> 02:17:19,393
<i>you were paid for it,
so no point in mentioning it.</i>

1371
02:17:19,393 --> 02:17:22,283
- I wasn't!
<i>- You should have asked for it.</i>

1372
02:17:22,283 --> 02:17:26,518
He did, and they said
it's a delicate time for the company

1373
02:17:26,518 --> 02:17:29,033
and everyone must make sacrifices.

1374
02:17:29,167 --> 02:17:31,768
Though they declare rising profits.

1375
02:17:31,768 --> 02:17:38,851
Mr Hans Frank boasted their profits
grew by dozens of millions.

1376
02:17:38,851 --> 02:17:40,450
Euro! Euro, at that!

1377
02:17:40,958 --> 02:17:45,018
<i>Maybe before the pandemic,
but the two aren't mutually exclusive.</i>

1378
02:17:45,018 --> 02:17:48,367
<i>Even with higher profits,
you can have a lot of issues.</i>

1379
02:17:48,367 --> 02:17:50,684
<i>Negative growth is a thing.</i>

1380
02:17:50,684 --> 02:17:53,809
But the accident happened
because of overtime.

1381
02:17:53,809 --> 02:17:58,059
At 5pm there's still light,
the driver would have seen the barrier.

1382
02:17:58,059 --> 02:18:02,434
<i>Speculation!
And 5pm in late November is dark.</i>

1383
02:18:02,434 --> 02:18:04,325
No it isn't.

1384
02:18:04,708 --> 02:18:08,408
And it had been
sunny the whole week.

1385
02:18:08,583 --> 02:18:11,184
<i>No point complaining
about overtime.</i>

1386
02:18:11,184 --> 02:18:14,809
<i>In these hard times, you could
have made a small effort.</i>

1387
02:18:14,809 --> 02:18:17,559
<i>We keep praising
the Americans,</i>

1388
02:18:17,559 --> 02:18:19,809
<i>but did you see them
during that tornado?</i>

1389
02:18:19,809 --> 02:18:24,158
<i>Workers in a candle factory
in Kentucky were kept at work</i>

1390
02:18:24,333 --> 02:18:29,367
<i>and Amazon asked an employee
to deliver in the tornado.</i>

1391
02:18:29,367 --> 02:18:33,559
<i>You think you're exploited
because of a few minutes of overtime!</i>

1392
02:18:33,559 --> 02:18:36,033
- I'm not complaining.
<i>- Yes you are.</i>

1393
02:18:36,208 --> 02:18:40,158
<i>And Kentucky is full of troglodyte apes.</i>

1394
02:18:40,458 --> 02:18:45,700
<i>That Colonel Sanders from KFC
was apparently a huge racist.</i>

1395
02:18:46,125 --> 02:18:49,184
<i>- That's why I prefer McDonald's.</i>
- Same here!

1396
02:18:49,184 --> 02:18:50,601
<i>Or Burger King.</i>

1397
02:18:50,601 --> 02:18:53,559
<i>Profits grew in Lithuania, not here.</i>

1398
02:18:53,559 --> 02:18:57,200
<i>Tibi, can I have a word?</i>

1399
02:18:58,625 --> 02:19:06,033
<i>Let him say whatever first,
then add the safety helmet thing.</i>

1400
02:19:06,033 --> 02:19:10,492
<i>And we'll just use the second part.
Can't we edit out the rest?</i>

1401
02:19:10,833 --> 02:19:14,617
<i>Yes, of course, but...
I don't agree.</i>

1402
02:19:15,333 --> 02:19:18,268
<i>This is supposed to be
an educational film.</i>

1403
02:19:18,268 --> 02:19:20,033
<i>Telling the truth.</i>

1404
02:19:20,167 --> 02:19:23,059
<i>- Don't start.
- I don't, but...</i>

1405
02:19:23,059 --> 02:19:26,658
<i>I can't tell him what to say.</i>

1406
02:19:27,083 --> 02:19:29,242
<i>I won't edit it out, either.</i>

1407
02:19:31,292 --> 02:19:34,158
<i>I'll give you the complete footage.</i>

1408
02:19:34,625 --> 02:19:40,117
<i>I left the camera running the whole time,
you can even do a "making of."</i>

1409
02:19:40,292 --> 02:19:43,033
<i>- Then we'll edit it.
- Suit yourselves.</i>

1410
02:19:43,208 --> 02:19:45,283
<i>I'm staying out of that.</i>

1411
02:19:45,708 --> 02:19:49,893
<i>I'll be fair and give you
the footage with all he says.</i>

1412
02:19:49,893 --> 02:19:52,283
<i>Wait, Doris is calling me.</i>

1413
02:19:52,417 --> 02:19:54,367
<i>Break for two minutes!</i>

1414
02:20:16,542 --> 02:20:19,658
- I'm on your side.
- Thank you.

1415
02:20:20,042 --> 02:20:23,268
I won't have you say
anything but the truth.

1416
02:20:23,268 --> 02:20:27,434
We have to,
the lawsuit is still on.

1417
02:20:27,434 --> 02:20:30,533
This footage
could be used against us.

1418
02:20:30,958 --> 02:20:36,684
The defense would go
"He himself says it was his fault!"

1419
02:20:36,684 --> 02:20:39,617
And it's not true,
it was their fault.

1420
02:20:41,667 --> 02:20:44,184
Maybe it wasn't a good move
to accept this.

1421
02:20:44,184 --> 02:20:48,075
We meant not to.
But it's good money.

1422
02:20:48,833 --> 02:20:53,617
Could be a peace offering,
maybe we'll strike a deal.

1423
02:20:54,708 --> 02:20:57,143
- Don't give up.
- We won't.

1424
02:20:57,143 --> 02:21:01,158
But you know their bean-counters
cling to every straw.

1425
02:21:01,158 --> 02:21:03,367
We need to stay alert.

1426
02:21:06,667 --> 02:21:09,742
<i>In the Second World War,</i>

1427
02:21:10,333 --> 02:21:15,143
<i>an American officer who had been
in command of an execution squad</i>

1428
02:21:15,143 --> 02:21:20,184
<i>went around to each person
executed for defection</i>

1429
02:21:20,184 --> 02:21:23,059
<i>and pulled out the bullets.</i>

1430
02:21:23,059 --> 02:21:25,908
- What for?
<i>- I'm getting there.</i>

1431
02:21:25,908 --> 02:21:30,325
He made a necklace
out of these bullets.

1432
02:21:31,333 --> 02:21:37,033
His superior notices and
court-martials him for robbing cadavers.

1433
02:21:37,167 --> 02:21:39,393
Here's where it gets interesting.

1434
02:21:39,393 --> 02:21:45,101
The officer, or his attorney,
claims he didn't rob the bodies,

1435
02:21:45,101 --> 02:21:49,809
as the bullets weren't
the property of the executed,

1436
02:21:49,809 --> 02:21:54,033
but the property
of the execution squad.

1437
02:21:54,167 --> 02:21:59,408
As such, the officer only
took back what was rightfully his.

1438
02:22:00,667 --> 02:22:04,893
Sure, the prosecutor says,
they belonged to the squad,

1439
02:22:04,893 --> 02:22:09,184
but firing them was
the same as discarding them.

1440
02:22:09,184 --> 02:22:12,783
So the squad
had relinquished ownership.

1441
02:22:12,783 --> 02:22:16,492
Basically, the firing squad
made a donation,

1442
02:22:16,583 --> 02:22:20,033
donated the bullets
to the executed.

1443
02:22:20,033 --> 02:22:24,242
Which means our officer
did rob the cadavers

1444
02:22:24,333 --> 02:22:28,533
who had came to own
the bullets by donation.

1445
02:22:28,958 --> 02:22:34,351
But, says the officer,
or his lawyer,

1446
02:22:34,351 --> 02:22:36,143
we may presume,

1447
02:22:36,143 --> 02:22:41,726
as confirmed by their attitude
before and during the execution,

1448
02:22:41,726 --> 02:22:45,825
we may presume, then,
that the executed

1449
02:22:45,958 --> 02:22:49,783
firmly rejected
the donation of bullets.

1450
02:22:49,783 --> 02:22:53,033
They absolutely
did not want those bullets.

1451
02:22:53,033 --> 02:22:56,768
As they refused them,
our officer robbed no one.

1452
02:22:56,768 --> 02:23:00,658
He just took back the refused
donation from the executed.

1453
02:23:00,792 --> 02:23:03,033
I don't get it.

1454
02:23:04,292 --> 02:23:05,992
It's raining.

1455
02:23:06,083 --> 02:23:08,268
- Is this story made up?
- No!

1456
02:23:08,268 --> 02:23:10,367
<i>No, it's all true!</i>

1457
02:23:10,367 --> 02:23:12,184
<i>I read about it too.</i>

1458
02:23:12,184 --> 02:23:15,768
- So what was the sentence?
<i>- Not guilty, apparently.</i>

1459
02:23:15,768 --> 02:23:17,033
<i>Fuck off!</i>

1460
02:23:18,292 --> 02:23:20,033
<i>Go back to India!</i>

1461
02:23:20,708 --> 02:23:24,309
<i>Come again and I'll break your legs!
Little bastards!</i>

1462
02:23:24,309 --> 02:23:28,018
- Serves them right!
<i>- They're children, Madam.</i>

1463
02:23:28,018 --> 02:23:31,492
Children today, thieves tomorrow!

1464
02:23:31,583 --> 02:23:35,309
<i>Doris is at the hotel, not feeling well,
but she wants to see our framing.</i>

1465
02:23:35,309 --> 02:23:37,450
<i>What a racist hag!</i>

1466
02:23:40,708 --> 02:23:43,992
<i>Ioana wants to show our framing
to the Austrian client.</i>

1467
02:23:43,992 --> 02:23:48,658
<i>She can come with her phone
and film the video assist monitor.</i>

1468
02:23:52,750 --> 02:23:55,184
<i>Don't worry,
it's just a light drizzle.</i>

1469
02:23:55,184 --> 02:23:58,408
We're getting wet!

1470
02:24:03,542 --> 02:24:04,809
<i>Can you see?</i>

1471
02:24:04,809 --> 02:24:08,018
<i>I can't see very well, but
if the barrier is rusty and dirty,</i>

1472
02:24:08,018 --> 02:24:09,434
<i>then keep it out of the frame.</i>

1473
02:24:09,434 --> 02:24:12,309
<i>I don't want to give ammunition
to our enemies, really.</i>

1474
02:24:12,309 --> 02:24:14,809
<i>OK, and what
should we have in frame?</i>

1475
02:24:14,809 --> 02:24:18,367
<i>Well, only the building, no barrier.</i>

1476
02:24:21,792 --> 02:24:24,643
<i>Yeah, tschuss!
Keep up the good work, bye.</i>

1477
02:24:24,643 --> 02:24:27,658
<i>We need to keep the barrier
out of the frame.</i>

1478
02:24:27,658 --> 02:24:32,934
<i>It's fine, we're filming in 8K,
you can zoom in all you need.</i>

1479
02:24:32,934 --> 02:24:34,992
<i>All the way to close-up.</i>

1480
02:24:38,208 --> 02:24:42,992
<i>No, remove it.
The raindrops will show if we zoom in.</i>

1481
02:24:43,792 --> 02:24:46,033
<i>Get rid of it.</i>

1482
02:24:48,292 --> 02:24:50,158
Take it away.

1483
02:24:55,042 --> 02:24:57,143
<i>Did you know that during communism,</i>

1484
02:24:57,143 --> 02:24:59,893
<i>occupational safety films
blamed the workers, too?</i>

1485
02:24:59,893 --> 02:25:03,533
<i>All films were censored back then.
Motherfuckers!</i>

1486
02:25:04,458 --> 02:25:05,658
<i>Ovidiu!</i>

1487
02:25:06,083 --> 02:25:10,117
We removed the barrier,
so don't point to it.

1488
02:25:13,042 --> 02:25:16,158
Go to the back,
keep the ladies dry.

1489
02:25:17,458 --> 02:25:21,658
When he talks about his coma,
you should take his hand.

1490
02:25:21,658 --> 02:25:23,783
Affectionately.

1491
02:25:24,083 --> 02:25:28,101
Affectionately,
Grandma Angela moves on!

1492
02:25:28,101 --> 02:25:31,325
- It doesn't cover all of us.
- We'll get one more.

1493
02:25:34,958 --> 02:25:39,325
<i>- Only hold it between takes.</i>
- Understood.

1494
02:25:40,792 --> 02:25:44,158
<i>I'll record this take with my phone,
so Doris can send it to her boss.</i>

1495
02:25:44,158 --> 02:25:47,008
<i>It will look bad on a phone.</i>

1496
02:25:47,833 --> 02:25:50,934
<i>Hans Frank wants to see
what we're filming.</i>

1497
02:25:50,934 --> 02:25:52,867
<i>Fine, just go!</i>

1498
02:25:53,333 --> 02:25:54,908
<i>It's raining!</i>

1499
02:25:55,292 --> 02:25:57,283
<i>- Sound!
- Rolling.</i>

1500
02:25:59,042 --> 02:26:00,809
Wait, you're leaving?

1501
02:26:00,809 --> 02:26:02,059
<i>Action!</i>

1502
02:26:02,059 --> 02:26:04,309
Hello, I am Ovidiu.

1503
02:26:04,309 --> 02:26:10,143
On the 24th of November 2020,
I had worked non-stop for 17 hours

1504
02:26:10,143 --> 02:26:12,434
for a furniture delivery to France.

1505
02:26:12,434 --> 02:26:15,992
The holidays were coming
and we were all working hard.

1506
02:26:16,167 --> 02:26:19,658
I came out of the warehouse
and walked to the exit,

1507
02:26:19,658 --> 02:26:23,992
to get my car from
the parking lot and go home.

1508
02:26:24,208 --> 02:26:29,658
The lighting outside here is poor,
it's pitch black at night.

1509
02:26:30,917 --> 02:26:32,393
Suddenly,

1510
02:26:32,393 --> 02:26:36,783
an old Dacia 1310 came this way.

1511
02:26:37,083 --> 02:26:41,533
The driver didn't see that barrier,
so he hit it.

1512
02:26:42,708 --> 02:26:47,867
It's not marked,
just a rusty metal bar on a cylinder.

1513
02:26:48,833 --> 02:26:53,367
The car hit it, sent it flying,
it hit me in the head.

1514
02:26:54,708 --> 02:26:59,283
I was in a coma
for a year and one month.

1515
02:27:00,792 --> 02:27:03,242
I came out of the coma

1516
02:27:05,958 --> 02:27:09,742
and found myself paralysed
from the waist down.

1517
02:27:12,208 --> 02:27:15,283
My back was all infected from bedsores.

1518
02:27:17,375 --> 02:27:20,075
It was all red raw.

1519
02:27:21,708 --> 02:27:26,992
I want to tell everyone
to wear their safety helmets,

1520
02:27:27,083 --> 02:27:29,658
so that incidents like this
don't happen again.

1521
02:27:29,792 --> 02:27:32,434
<i>Cut! Great!
Bring the umbrellas.</i>

1522
02:27:32,434 --> 02:27:34,283
<i>Bravo, Ovidiu!</i>

1523
02:27:40,667 --> 02:27:43,559
<i>I'm sending this to Austria now.</i>

1524
02:27:43,559 --> 02:27:46,533
<i>We'll wait for their feedback.</i>

1525
02:27:48,708 --> 02:27:51,658
<i>Waiting in the fucking rain!</i>

1526
02:27:55,083 --> 02:27:57,268
If you want to leave,
I'll drive you.

1527
02:27:57,268 --> 02:27:58,809
Yes, let's go.

1528
02:27:58,809 --> 02:28:01,033
They're bastards!

1529
02:28:03,708 --> 02:28:07,643
<i>In those communist films they used to show
horrible things, hands chopped off.</i>

1530
02:28:07,643 --> 02:28:09,476
<i>They also blamed the workers!</i>

1531
02:28:09,476 --> 02:28:14,200
<i>They were made to say:
"I made this fucking mistake..."</i>

1532
02:28:20,542 --> 02:28:22,184
Hi, it's Bobiță!

1533
02:28:22,184 --> 02:28:25,976
This is my atomic fallout shelter
with some sluts inside,

1534
02:28:25,976 --> 02:28:29,351
can't tell you much about them,
there's people around.

1535
02:28:29,351 --> 02:28:30,783
Just want to say:

1536
02:28:30,958 --> 02:28:35,684
I support President Putin
in his crusade against Nazis

1537
02:28:35,684 --> 02:28:40,434
as for Zelensky,
that two-dime Jew actor,

1538
02:28:40,434 --> 02:28:43,809
I hope he dies like Hitler
and his Ukraine with him,

1539
02:28:43,809 --> 02:28:47,450
and Mr Putin stays there forever!

1540
02:28:48,208 --> 02:28:49,934
<i>Slava Rossii!</i>

1541
02:28:49,934 --> 02:28:52,033
- Are you OK?
- Yes.

1542
02:28:52,708 --> 02:28:54,158
<i>Surya Bonaly!</i>

1543
02:28:55,208 --> 02:28:58,867
<i>Aren't you afraid
they'll label you a Putinist?</i>

1544
02:28:59,083 --> 02:29:03,059
<i>No, I hope some people
are still smart.</i>

1545
02:29:03,059 --> 02:29:06,434
- You worked for 30 hours?
- Even 48, once.

1546
02:29:06,434 --> 02:29:09,408
I was younger,
I wouldn't do it now.

1547
02:29:09,408 --> 02:29:12,658
We were shooting in the mountains

1548
02:29:13,042 --> 02:29:15,408
that took 40 hours, for a beer ad.

1549
02:29:15,408 --> 02:29:18,658
- The one with the deer?
- No, the one with the squirrel.

1550
02:29:19,667 --> 02:29:22,783
Now I don't accept anything over 16 hours.

1551
02:29:22,783 --> 02:29:25,908
- As everyone should.
- Except they don't.

1552
02:29:26,208 --> 02:29:30,783
- To each their own.
- They don't want to upset producers.

1553
02:29:30,783 --> 02:29:34,158
<i>Hans Frank says
he has a problem with the text.</i>

1554
02:29:34,333 --> 02:29:37,033
<i>- Says he wants the Bob Dylan thing.</i>
- What?

1555
02:29:39,083 --> 02:29:42,367
"No way, the text is problematical.

1556
02:29:42,458 --> 02:29:47,742
Do it like in the stupid
hippie kike Bob Dylan clip. With papers."

1557
02:29:48,208 --> 02:29:49,783
<i>Sounds like Donald Trump.</i>

1558
02:29:49,783 --> 02:29:51,492
<i>Zimmerman!</i>

1559
02:29:52,167 --> 02:29:54,158
<i>Wait, I get it!</i>

1560
02:29:54,158 --> 02:29:59,559
<i>Bob Dylan has this video where
he's holding sheets with the lyrics</i>

1561
02:29:59,559 --> 02:30:02,143
<i>and letting them drop one by one.</i>

1562
02:30:02,143 --> 02:30:04,617
Subterranean Homesick Blues.

1563
02:30:04,617 --> 02:30:07,309
- Subterranean Homesick Blues!
<i>- Yes, we know.</i>

1564
02:30:07,309 --> 02:30:09,533
<i>Do we even have paper?</i>

1565
02:30:12,300 --> 02:30:16,000
<i>You can write the text
and I'll go print it out.</i>

1566
02:30:16,292 --> 02:30:19,867
<i>Then let's do this.
Page one...</i>

1567
02:30:20,458 --> 02:30:21,809
<i>"After work."</i>

1568
02:30:21,809 --> 02:30:24,434
<i>Page two
"I was heading to the exit."</i>

1569
02:30:24,434 --> 02:30:28,033
<i>Page three
"A car hit the barrier."</i>

1570
02:30:28,208 --> 02:30:30,809
<i>Page four
"I wasn't wearing a helmet."</i>

1571
02:30:30,809 --> 02:30:34,367
<i>Wait, the paper will be shiny.</i>

1572
02:30:34,667 --> 02:30:38,658
<i>In our truck there's
a big green board.</i>

1573
02:30:38,658 --> 02:30:42,658
<i>- We just cut that.
- We need white ones, not green.</i>

1574
02:30:43,083 --> 02:30:47,908
<i>No, this green board
works like a chroma key.</i>

1575
02:30:48,333 --> 02:30:52,283
<i>You can fill them with
any text you want later.</i>

1576
02:30:52,283 --> 02:30:54,643
<i>Great idea, Andi, hats off!</i>

1577
02:30:54,643 --> 02:30:58,783
<i>- And it won't stay green?
- No it won't!</i>

1578
02:30:59,583 --> 02:31:04,283
<i>They're green because
it's easy to replace in CGI.</i>

1579
02:31:05,167 --> 02:31:07,184
<i>- Bănel!
- Yessir!</i>

1580
02:31:07,184 --> 02:31:11,158
<i>Cut that green board
into ten A3 rectangles.</i>

1581
02:31:11,833 --> 02:31:14,783
<i>- Ten will do, right?
- Even fewer.</i>

1582
02:31:17,167 --> 02:31:20,033
<i>So you are like
Charlie Hebdo, Anjelica?</i>

1583
02:31:23,625 --> 02:31:25,658
<i>Maybe you'll be shot in the head.</i>

1584
02:31:26,792 --> 02:31:31,408
<i>Valeriu Sterian made
a remake of Dylan's video.</i>

1585
02:31:33,292 --> 02:31:35,434
<i>Oh, the one with...</i>

1586
02:31:35,434 --> 02:31:38,658
<i>"Declaration" and all that shit.</i>

1587
02:31:42,083 --> 02:31:44,783
<i>- You don't know it?
- No.</i>

1588
02:31:44,958 --> 02:31:46,783
Who?

1589
02:31:46,917 --> 02:31:50,867
Valeriu Sterian, he had this video.
Holding papers.

1590
02:31:53,417 --> 02:31:55,075
Here it is.

1591
02:32:24,583 --> 02:32:27,075
<i>- It's in English?
- Yes.</i>

1592
02:32:37,833 --> 02:32:42,283
Didn't he sing the one with
"Look what's left of humans"?

1593
02:32:47,958 --> 02:32:54,658
...Institution, Separation
Prostitution, Decoration...

1594
02:32:58,833 --> 02:33:01,283
<i>I think it's about 90s stuff.</i>

1595
02:33:02,458 --> 02:33:04,684
I think that one's
about President Iliescu,

1596
02:33:04,684 --> 02:33:07,768
he called himself
an emanation of the Revolution.

1597
02:33:07,768 --> 02:33:10,492
<i>They called him "The Emanated."</i>

1598
02:33:17,042 --> 02:33:19,450
<i>Fuck you and your filming!</i>

1599
02:33:45,125 --> 02:33:48,684
<i>Why isn't Doris Goethe here
if she cares so much,</i>

1600
02:33:48,684 --> 02:33:52,165
<i>instead of directing us
from Heldenplatz?</i>

1601
02:33:54,583 --> 02:33:57,643
<i>She's feeling sick,
she's at the hotel.</i>

1602
02:33:57,643 --> 02:34:01,434
<i>Between you and me, last night
she drank with some creeps.</i>

1603
02:34:01,434 --> 02:34:03,533
<i>A €2000 tab.</i>

1604
02:34:03,708 --> 02:34:08,783
<i>They're paying our fees too,
we can't badmouth them.</i>

1605
02:34:09,333 --> 02:34:14,283
<i>Ms Goethe can keep
her airs to herself.</i>

1606
02:34:14,958 --> 02:34:20,117
<i>Read Thomas Bernhard, you'll see
the Austrians were real Nazis.</i>

1607
02:34:20,417 --> 02:34:25,033
<i>Millions of them
applauded Hitler in 38 in Heldenplatz.</i>

1608
02:34:25,417 --> 02:34:29,408
<i>They were happy with the Anschluss,
only played the victims later.</i>

1609
02:34:29,500 --> 02:34:34,492
<i>In the 80s they voted an SS officer
for president, Kurt Waldheim.</i>

1610
02:34:35,458 --> 02:34:37,684
<i>I can't stand them.</i>

1611
02:34:37,684 --> 02:34:41,351
<i>They come here, destroy our forests,</i>

1612
02:34:41,351 --> 02:34:44,783
<i>and we just stand by
and make videos for them.</i>

1613
02:35:26,542 --> 02:35:27,684
Ready?

1614
02:35:27,684 --> 02:35:30,367
Fast as a circus artist!

1615
02:35:30,367 --> 02:35:33,117
<i>Getting ready to shoot!</i>

1616
02:35:37,667 --> 02:35:40,783
You hold these like
Bob Dylan in the video.

1617
02:35:41,083 --> 02:35:43,158
Or like Vali Sterian.

1618
02:35:43,583 --> 02:35:47,268
And, one by one,
you pass them to the young lady.

1619
02:35:47,268 --> 02:35:49,033
- In silence?
- Yes.

1620
02:35:49,033 --> 02:35:50,408
Understood.

1621
02:36:07,208 --> 02:36:08,908
<i>- Sound!
- Rolling.</i>

1622
02:36:12,083 --> 02:36:13,992
<i>- Set!
- Action!</i>

1623
02:36:52,833 --> 02:36:54,283
<i>Excellent!</i>

1624
02:36:54,458 --> 02:36:57,158
<i>Now, Ovidiu, the same thing.</i>

1625
02:36:57,500 --> 02:37:00,242
<i>Pass him the boards.</i>

1626
02:37:00,242 --> 02:37:02,575
<i>- Just slower.
- Understood.</i>

1627
02:37:02,667 --> 02:37:04,325
<i>And action!</i>

1628
02:37:44,583 --> 02:37:46,033
<i>Very good!</i>

1629
02:37:47,667 --> 02:37:50,367
<i>Lunch break, then home!</i>

1630
02:37:50,792 --> 02:37:54,158
<i>OK, lunch break,
shooting's over!</i>

1631
02:37:54,333 --> 02:37:56,658
- Finally!
- Great work!

1632
02:37:57,542 --> 02:38:00,200
Madam, perfectly done.

1633
02:38:00,292 --> 02:38:02,658
There's nothing
on those green boards.

1634
02:38:02,917 --> 02:38:07,367
No, they'll add text
with computer graphics.

1635
02:38:07,958 --> 02:38:10,976
So they can write
whatever they want?

1636
02:38:10,976 --> 02:38:14,059
I'll raise hell
if that happens!

1637
02:38:14,059 --> 02:38:17,476
<i>Don't worry, Madam,
we'll write what we said we would.</i>

1638
02:38:17,476 --> 02:38:20,934
- You won't trick us, will you?
<i>- God, no!</i>

1639
02:38:20,934 --> 02:38:24,242
<i>We're a world-class company.</i>

1640

<i>We can't ruin our
international prestige for...</i>

1641
02:38:28,184 --> 02:38:30,643
<i>You can always sue us.</i>

1642
02:38:30,643 --> 02:38:34,101
We don't have the time or the money
and we're fed up with lawsuits!

<i>Bobiță asks</i>

1645
02:38:41,833 --> 02:38:45,726
I hope they won't write
something that could harm us.

1646
02:38:45,726 --> 02:38:48,059
Out of the question.

1647
02:38:48,059 --> 02:38:51,658
Something that could be used against us.

1648
02:38:52,250 --> 02:38:53,742
Don't worry.

1649

Let's eat!

1650

It's all I can do.
It really is!

1651
02:39:01,667 --> 02:39:06,033
- Thank you for being on our side.
- Don't mention it.

My, I'm so stiff.

1653

Ilinca, wait for us!

1654
02:39:28,375 --> 02:39:30,434
Get in!

1655
02:39:30,434 --> 02:39:32,908
Don't let the dog near me.

- But we're going to eat.
- They told us to come to lunch.

I have to drive you home,
I'm so busy today.

WE WALK ON THE ROOF OF HELL

1664
02:40:51,726 --> 02:40:54,533
GAZING AT FLOWERS

1665
02:41:27,125 --> 02:41:31,609
SOUND OF A SAW;
POOR PEOPLE, WINTER MIDNIGHT

1666
02:41:47,208 --> 02:41:49,434
WAKE UP! WAKE UP!

1667
02:41:49,434 --> 02:41:51,726
LET'S BE FRIENDS

1668
02:41:51,726 --> 02:41:53,742
SLEEPING BUTTERFLY

1669
02:42:15,042 --> 02:42:16,684
YOU MAKE THE FIRE

1670
02:42:16,684 --> 02:42:18,684
AND I'LL SHOW YOU SOMETHING WONDERFUL:

1671
02:42:18,684 --> 02:42:20,992
A BIG BALL OF SNOW!

1672
02:42:33,034 --> 02:42:37,206
DON'T WORRY, SPIDERS.
I KEEP HOUSE CASUALLY.
