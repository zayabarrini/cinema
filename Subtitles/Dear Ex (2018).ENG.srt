1
00:00:39,588 --> 00:00:42,046
Do you know that adults
are the stupidest creatures on earth?

2
00:00:44,838 --> 00:00:48,130
They think they can just make up stories
to hide secrets.

3
00:00:49,338 --> 00:00:50,355
They're retards.

4
00:00:51,671 --> 00:00:54,713
They said that bad guys killed my dad
for the insurance money.

5
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,046
What an idiot.

6
00:00:59,005 --> 00:01:01,546
I've known all along that my dad was gay.

7
00:01:04,546 --> 00:01:07,171
He died 95 days ago.

8
00:01:09,338 --> 00:01:11,213
I don't know where people go
after they die,

9
00:01:12,796 --> 00:01:14,213
but Liu San-lien

10
00:01:14,713 --> 00:01:16,088
took me to a place...

11
00:02:11,338 --> 00:02:16,671
It's 1:05 p.m. now. The program
you're listening to now is Mommy DoReMi.

12
00:02:16,755 --> 00:02:18,213
I'm your host, Chung Ксиn-ling.

13
00:02:19,213 --> 00:02:21,338
Nobody's home.
There's no use banging the door.

14
00:02:22,005 --> 00:02:23,546
-He must still be sleeping.
-Who?

15
00:02:23,713 --> 00:02:24,713
A shameless guy.

16
00:02:26,421 --> 00:02:28,671
-Someone Sung Cheng-yuan knows.
-So he is Dad's friend.

17
00:02:28,755 --> 00:02:30,963
-Why do you have to talk that way?
-How about you?

18
00:02:31,255 --> 00:02:32,921
Is that how you talk to your mom?

19
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,671
Birds of the same feather flock together.

20
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,921
Still sleeping?

21
00:02:55,005 --> 00:02:58,213
I don't believe that I can't wake you up.

22
00:03:04,463 --> 00:03:05,421
Are you looking for me?

23
00:03:12,588 --> 00:03:14,671
-He made you the beneficiary, didn't he?
-What?

24
00:03:15,046 --> 00:03:17,380
Or did you change the beneficiary
when he was unconscious?

25
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,255
You shameless bastard!

26
00:03:20,338 --> 00:03:21,796
That money was meant for his son.

27
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,088
Tell him your name and who your dad is.

28
00:03:24,171 --> 00:03:25,463
Tell him yourself.

29
00:03:25,588 --> 00:03:26,463
Sung Cheng-Кси.

30
00:03:27,088 --> 00:03:29,380
If you play with your phone again,
I'll break it!

31
00:03:29,463 --> 00:03:31,588
If you're coming in,
please close the door behind you.

32
00:03:31,671 --> 00:03:33,671
Otherwise, just close the door.

33
00:03:34,296 --> 00:03:37,171
He needs to go to high school, college
and then study abroad.

34
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:40,713
Never mind that you two messed up my life.
Now you're taking his son's money too?

35
00:03:40,796 --> 00:03:42,088
Are you coming in or not, Auntie?

36
00:03:42,171 --> 00:03:43,255
Who...

37
00:03:43,755 --> 00:03:45,338
Who are you calling Auntie?

38
00:03:46,255 --> 00:03:47,380
Are you coming in or not?

39
00:03:49,421 --> 00:03:50,713
You wait here!

40
00:03:51,505 --> 00:03:52,880
Drink this if you're thirsty.

41
00:03:53,671 --> 00:03:54,796
I'll be out in a second.

42
00:03:55,296 --> 00:03:56,713
Take it, Sung Cheng-Кси!

43
00:03:57,588 --> 00:03:58,546
Quick.

44
00:03:59,838 --> 00:04:00,838
I'll be out in a second.

45
00:04:05,796 --> 00:04:08,546
Sung Cheng-yuan's insurance money
was his way of making up to his son.

46
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,921
-Did he make you the beneficiary?
-"Ben"? "Fishery"?

47
00:04:11,005 --> 00:04:13,796
-Can you speak in Mandarin?
-How dare you? Stop playing dumb.

48
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,838
Auntie, you're not busy, but I am!

49
00:04:15,921 --> 00:04:18,046
I don't have time for this.
Let me be straight with you.

50
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:20,796
If you have any conscience, give it back.

51
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,130
I don't know what Ben or fishery
you are talking about.

52
00:04:23,213 --> 00:04:27,296
All I know is that Sung Cheng-yuan
gave you every penny he had, didn't he?

53
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,171
If you're not the beneficiary,
then who is?

54
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:31,838
Turn left when you go out.
Get your answer at the temple there.

55
00:04:31,921 --> 00:04:33,088
Quit playing innocent.

56
00:04:33,171 --> 00:04:34,088
You shameless mistress.

57
00:04:34,171 --> 00:04:36,380
Watch your mouth! Do you have any respect?

58
00:04:37,671 --> 00:04:38,713
I'm still a guy.

59
00:04:38,796 --> 00:04:40,338
At least, call me a male lover.

60
00:04:55,005 --> 00:04:57,463
You've got a week
to give me the insurance money.

61
00:04:57,546 --> 00:04:59,963
Or I swear I'll find a congressman
and hold a press conference.

62
00:05:00,046 --> 00:05:01,546
I'll make sure the whole world knows

63
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:05,213
-that you're a family-wrecking fag.
-Why don't you get the SNG vans to come?

64
00:05:05,296 --> 00:05:06,796
-Right here.
-You pervert. Shame on you!

65
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,296
-Here!
-Don't think I wouldn't dare.

66
00:05:08,838 --> 00:05:10,046
You damn gay!

67
00:05:12,796 --> 00:05:15,046
Hubby, pick up the phone.

68
00:05:16,046 --> 00:05:18,171
Pick up the phone, Hubby.

69
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,380
Hubby, pick up the phone now.

70
00:05:22,213 --> 00:05:24,630
Hubby, pick up the phone.

71
00:05:25,713 --> 00:05:27,713
Pick up the phone, Hubby.

72
00:05:28,046 --> 00:05:31,255
-Tell me, who's the mistress now?
-Hubby, pick up the phone now.

73
00:05:31,338 --> 00:05:32,546
Do you hear this clearly?

74
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:34,963
Hubby, pick up the phone.

75
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:38,213
Pick up the phone, Hubby.

76
00:05:39,296 --> 00:05:40,630
Hubby, pick up the phone...

77
00:05:47,171 --> 00:05:48,380
What's on your mind?

78
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:51,838
Do you want to talk about it?

79
00:05:56,838 --> 00:05:58,505
What kind of sports do you like to do?

80
00:06:02,755 --> 00:06:03,588
Dancing?

81
00:06:05,213 --> 00:06:06,463
Basketball?

82
00:06:06,963 --> 00:06:09,046
Or video games?

83
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:10,671
I like to beat up people. Can I go now?

84
00:06:17,171 --> 00:06:18,921
Thank you for respecting my opinion.

85
00:06:21,671 --> 00:06:23,546
I'll respect your privacy too.

86
00:06:24,588 --> 00:06:28,505
Unless you have the intention
to hurt yourself or others.

87
00:06:29,546 --> 00:06:33,005
Otherwise, I won't tell your mom
what we've talked about.

88
00:06:34,046 --> 00:06:35,630
How is that possible? She pays you.

89
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:38,463
Your mom pays me

90
00:06:40,171 --> 00:06:41,713
to help you.

91
00:06:42,463 --> 00:06:44,130
It's not to tell her what we've discussed.

92
00:06:44,213 --> 00:06:46,671
Do you think talking to you
will stop me from beating people up?

93
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,421
You'll only know when you've tried.

94
00:06:53,588 --> 00:06:54,421
How about

95
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:57,338
we try something else?

96
00:06:58,755 --> 00:07:00,046
Ask me anything you want.

97
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:03,880
It can be about anything.

98
00:07:04,546 --> 00:07:06,380
Family, friendship,

99
00:07:07,505 --> 00:07:09,296
love, anything.

100
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,796
Anything you want.

101
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:24,588
Between a mistress and a male lover,

102
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,088
who do you think would win?

103
00:07:32,296 --> 00:07:34,005
MISTRESS

104
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:35,255
LIU SAN-LIEN

105
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,880
Sung Cheng-Кси!

106
00:07:36,963 --> 00:07:38,213
Are you going to wake up or not?

107
00:07:38,463 --> 00:07:39,796
It must be the name "Liu San-lien"

108
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,796
-that made her a mistress.
-You have to be early.

109
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,630
The alarm has been ringing
for ten minutes.

110
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:45,963
All right. Have it your way.

111
00:07:46,505 --> 00:07:48,255
Don't say I didn't wake you up
if you're late.

112
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:53,630
She is the noisiest woman on Earth.

113
00:07:54,255 --> 00:07:55,463
Sung Cheng-Кси!

114
00:07:56,213 --> 00:07:59,755
What the hell did you stick
in the keyhole?

115
00:08:00,588 --> 00:08:02,338
She thinks the whole world owes her.

116
00:08:02,421 --> 00:08:04,463
-Mrs. Sung.
-So she's in a bad mood every day.

117
00:08:05,005 --> 00:08:06,505
The name listed as the beneficiary

118
00:08:07,171 --> 00:08:08,463
is not your son.

119
00:08:11,213 --> 00:08:12,130
What do you mean?

120
00:08:12,713 --> 00:08:14,088
He changed it to that lover's name?

121
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,963
I told you to sue him for adultery.
You didn't want to.

122
00:08:18,046 --> 00:08:19,005
How can I do that?

123
00:08:19,213 --> 00:08:20,963
I have a life to live,
so does Sung Cheng-Кси.

124
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:24,421
He's the cheater.

125
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:26,046
The shame is on him.

126
00:08:26,463 --> 00:08:28,005
What does it have to do with your lives?

127
00:08:29,921 --> 00:08:31,755
You are so stupid!

128
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:34,880
-I don't know--
-He was cheating on me with a man!

129
00:08:34,963 --> 00:08:36,213
Even if the lover was...

130
00:08:45,838 --> 00:08:48,046
I hate meal times the most.

131
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:49,130
Sung Cheng-Кси.

132
00:08:53,046 --> 00:08:55,505
What do you think I'm saving up for?

133
00:08:56,546 --> 00:08:59,796
It's for you to study abroad
so you can have a better life.

134
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,463
And you got these grades?

135
00:09:02,671 --> 00:09:04,046
Is this how you repay me?

136
00:09:04,671 --> 00:09:06,171
Am I not working hard enough?

137
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:09,796
You don't have to do anything else.

138
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,463
Just study. Is that so hard?

139
00:09:12,546 --> 00:09:14,296
Tell me. Is that so hard?

140
00:09:14,588 --> 00:09:17,046
Why don't you try it then?
Let's see if you can get good grades.

141
00:09:18,463 --> 00:09:19,463
You're talking back to me.

142
00:09:20,171 --> 00:09:21,255
Do I have tuition?

143
00:09:22,463 --> 00:09:23,921
Don't I need to work to earn money?

144
00:09:24,338 --> 00:09:26,880
Do you know how expensive
the tuition of private schools are?

145
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:29,796
They charge so much money
but I still have to teach you myself.

146
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,421
I'm going to see the principal tomorrow.

147
00:09:32,255 --> 00:09:33,796
Don't embarrass yourself again.

148
00:09:42,505 --> 00:09:43,580
Embarrass myself?

149
00:09:45,463 --> 00:09:46,755
Say that again.

150
00:09:47,546 --> 00:09:48,755
Who's embarrassing?

151
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:52,380
It's Hollywood's loss
that she didn't become an actress.

152
00:09:54,963 --> 00:09:57,838
Your grades are the reason
Sung Cheng-yuan didn't want to see you.

153
00:09:57,921 --> 00:09:59,088
Do you know that?

154
00:09:59,171 --> 00:10:00,046
Here we go.

155
00:10:01,005 --> 00:10:03,671
Three, two, one.

156
00:10:07,796 --> 00:10:11,338
I'm giving you everything, Sung Cheng-Кси.

157
00:10:11,921 --> 00:10:14,546
Why can't you simply try harder for me?

158
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:18,921
Why can't you do something
to make me proud?

159
00:10:22,046 --> 00:10:24,130
-I dare you to say that again.
-She should go

160
00:10:24,213 --> 00:10:25,630
-to Hollywood.
-Sung Cheng-Кси.

161
00:10:25,755 --> 00:10:27,838
I don't deserve this!

162
00:10:28,088 --> 00:10:29,255
Who embarrassed whom?

163
00:10:29,338 --> 00:10:30,505
You entered my room again?

164
00:10:33,713 --> 00:10:35,505
I changed your sheets
and vacuumed the floor.

165
00:10:35,588 --> 00:10:37,088
What if you get rashes again?

166
00:10:37,171 --> 00:10:38,296
Where's my stuff?

167
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:41,546
What stuff? You throw your stuff around.
Then, blame me when you lose it.

168
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:42,796
That's my stuff.

169
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:44,713
Didn't I pay for all of your stuff?

170
00:10:44,796 --> 00:10:45,671
Give it back!

171
00:10:45,755 --> 00:10:48,296
-Give what back?
-The stuff that you can't buy with money.

172
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:49,880
What kind of society are we living in?

173
00:10:49,963 --> 00:10:51,380
What can't be bought with money?

174
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:54,230
Dad's letters, his pictures,
and the watch he gave me.

175
00:10:54,338 --> 00:10:55,588
That lousy man.

176
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:57,663
He didn't even leave you
the insurance money.

177
00:10:57,671 --> 00:11:00,005
-What are you reminiscing about?
-It's still my stuff!

178
00:11:00,088 --> 00:11:01,088
I threw them away.

179
00:11:02,421 --> 00:11:03,963
You are so annoying!

180
00:11:07,921 --> 00:11:08,755
Where are you going?

181
00:11:17,046 --> 00:11:19,713
It's grandpa's birthday dinner tonight.
Don't be late.

182
00:11:19,838 --> 00:11:23,338
Adults who won't admit their mistakes
should be punished.

183
00:11:32,171 --> 00:11:33,255
His name is Chieh.

184
00:11:34,338 --> 00:11:36,463
MISTRESS

185
00:11:36,546 --> 00:11:38,380
Because he's a mistress with a dick,

186
00:11:39,296 --> 00:11:41,213
so he is a...

187
00:11:41,838 --> 00:11:45,963
MALE LOVER

188
00:11:46,046 --> 00:11:48,588
KAO YU-CHIEH

189
00:11:48,671 --> 00:11:50,130
He must be on drugs.

190
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:56,088
He walks around in his pajamas daily.

191
00:11:56,713 --> 00:11:58,438
Why won't the police
do something about it?

192
00:12:07,421 --> 00:12:08,496
Morning.

193
00:12:09,296 --> 00:12:10,588
Chieh, what are you doing here?

194
00:12:11,005 --> 00:12:12,038
Here.

195
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:36,796
You haven't had breakfast, right?

196
00:12:38,338 --> 00:12:39,546
Steamed dumplings.

197
00:12:39,796 --> 00:12:42,246
You need to look after yourself too,
not just the patient.

198
00:12:43,046 --> 00:12:44,080
Okay.

199
00:12:44,338 --> 00:12:45,880
Get well soon, folks.

200
00:12:46,505 --> 00:12:47,505
Best of luck to you!

201
00:12:47,588 --> 00:12:49,130
He's definitely on drugs.

202
00:12:50,088 --> 00:12:52,380
Get to the stage.

203
00:12:52,463 --> 00:12:55,005
-The third one.
-Add some lighting.

204
00:12:55,088 --> 00:12:56,963
-Bali
-I heard that he is a director

205
00:12:57,088 --> 00:12:58,296
and actor in a small theater.

206
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,588
-Hey, eat less.
-It must be a shitty one.

207
00:13:00,671 --> 00:13:02,046
I'm serious!

208
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:03,796
I'm serious too. Stop eating so much

209
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,796
and you'll be the theater version
of Jolin Tsai.

210
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,255
You can do this!

211
00:13:07,963 --> 00:13:09,630
Let's seize the moment.

212
00:13:10,421 --> 00:13:11,838
Let's test the lights.

213
00:13:11,921 --> 00:13:13,796
-On cue.
-He must have stolen

214
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,796
my dad's insurance money with his looks.

215
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:16,963
Chieh!

216
00:13:18,505 --> 00:13:19,338
Chieh!

217
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:21,130
Chieh!

218
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:26,255
-I can't do anything about that.
-There was so much left afterwards...

219
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:27,921
Stage Director, I'll do my makeup first.

220
00:13:28,005 --> 00:13:29,796
I'll be back before the tech rehearsals.

221
00:13:31,046 --> 00:13:32,130
There were a lot.

222
00:13:35,213 --> 00:13:36,463
It's not just me.

223
00:13:36,755 --> 00:13:38,213
Everyone's worried about you.

224
00:13:39,088 --> 00:13:40,671
There's nothing to worry about.

225
00:13:41,671 --> 00:13:43,046
I'm serious.

226
00:13:43,546 --> 00:13:47,463
Once you feel better,
we'll support you whenever you need it.

227
00:13:47,713 --> 00:13:49,130
I'm doing great. Can't you see that?

228
00:13:49,213 --> 00:13:50,838
Come on, man! I mean it.

229
00:13:51,088 --> 00:13:53,796
I mean it too. Don't worry.

230
00:13:54,463 --> 00:13:56,838
Can't you see? I'm as lively as a wolf.

231
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,338
That's exactly what worries me.

232
00:14:00,755 --> 00:14:02,463
I'd rather you cry about it.

233
00:14:03,213 --> 00:14:04,588
What the hell should I cry about?

234
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:06,755
I'm fine.

235
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:11,171
I just need 50,000 dollars

236
00:14:11,921 --> 00:14:13,130
to tide us over for a few days.

237
00:14:13,213 --> 00:14:15,130
I'll pay you back
once the tickets are sold.

238
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,921
People couldn't get a ticket
for our show 17 years ago!

239
00:14:19,005 --> 00:14:20,796
I made it even fancier this time.
Check it out!

240
00:14:20,963 --> 00:14:22,921
The stage, lights...

241
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:25,963
Just come to the tech rehearsal tonight.

242
00:14:26,213 --> 00:14:28,755
I've got Lin Wen-ju, the queen of theater,
on my crew!

243
00:14:29,255 --> 00:14:31,380
Once people hear about us,
they'd surely...

244
00:14:42,088 --> 00:14:42,963
So

245
00:14:43,505 --> 00:14:44,880
you went to his place?

246
00:14:49,338 --> 00:14:51,546
You didn't go to your friends' place
or internet cafes.

247
00:14:52,713 --> 00:14:54,338
You chose to go there.

248
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:56,205
Why?

249
00:14:59,338 --> 00:15:00,630
Aren't you the expert here?

250
00:15:02,213 --> 00:15:05,255
Who do you think
would get my dad's insurance money?

251
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:11,130
The man lover or the mistress?

252
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:18,130
Knock it off, Sung Cheng-Кси!

253
00:15:20,296 --> 00:15:22,838
Come home and change your clothes.

254
00:15:24,213 --> 00:15:26,380
We'll be late for Grandpa's
birthday party. Cut it out!

255
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:27,463
Open the door!

256
00:15:41,963 --> 00:15:43,963
Your mom learned her lesson.
Go home with her.

257
00:15:46,838 --> 00:15:48,588
-Let's go.
-I'll jump if you come any closer!

258
00:15:48,671 --> 00:15:50,380
Come down first.

259
00:15:50,463 --> 00:15:51,671
-It's dangerous!
-You think...

260
00:15:51,755 --> 00:15:53,171
I didn't throw your stuff away.

261
00:15:53,255 --> 00:15:55,421
Come home
and I'll give everything back to you.

262
00:15:55,505 --> 00:15:57,171
-I don't want them anymore! Scram!
-Please.

263
00:15:57,255 --> 00:15:58,421
-Get down first!
-Scram!

264
00:15:58,505 --> 00:15:59,963
-Okay. Calm down!
-Scram!

265
00:16:00,046 --> 00:16:01,796
-Calm down.
-Show some manners to your mom!

266
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:02,963
It's none of your business.

267
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:05,005
None of my business? This is my home.

268
00:16:05,088 --> 00:16:07,088
-Go and jump off your own balcony.
-Don't say that!

269
00:16:07,171 --> 00:16:09,921
Come on, Auntie! Can't you tell?
I'm trying to help you here.

270
00:16:10,505 --> 00:16:12,380
-Okay, just come here.
-I'm jumping now!

271
00:16:12,463 --> 00:16:13,880
-Sure. Go ahead!
-No!

272
00:16:13,963 --> 00:16:16,463
-Jump! Right now!
-Don't interfere in my family's affairs.

273
00:16:16,546 --> 00:16:18,838
Is that so?
Can you do this somewhere else then?

274
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:21,588
Let me tell you.
Come down within one second.

275
00:16:21,671 --> 00:16:23,880
And get out within three seconds.
Or I'm calling the cops!

276
00:16:24,046 --> 00:16:25,963
I'll get down when Liu San-lien
gets the hell out.

277
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:28,963
Are you sure?

278
00:16:29,046 --> 00:16:31,005
I'll get down when Liu San-lien
gets the hell out.

279
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:34,755
Fine.

280
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:36,505
Fine.

281
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:38,630
Come down here you punk!

282
00:16:42,213 --> 00:16:43,088
Come here!

283
00:16:43,421 --> 00:16:44,505
-Go away!
-No!

284
00:16:44,588 --> 00:16:46,463
I'll discipline my son myself!

285
00:16:46,546 --> 00:16:49,213
-I doubt that you can.
-It's because of your bad influence.

286
00:16:49,296 --> 00:16:52,088
You spent 14 years together.
We spent 40 minutes. You're ridiculous!

287
00:16:52,171 --> 00:16:55,546
Who knows what kind of voodoo spell
you cast on him to come here?

288
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:58,463
Maybe you've cursed me too.
No wonder I've been feeling unwell!

289
00:16:58,546 --> 00:16:59,546
Damn it, Auntie!

290
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:01,546
Why don't you take your son
to a temple and pray?

291
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:03,296
Then, go home to watch Taiwan Mystery.

292
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:04,255
Be good, okay?

293
00:17:16,213 --> 00:17:17,338
Are you hurt?

294
00:17:19,588 --> 00:17:21,721
I'd rather die than go home.

295
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,921
ICED WATER

296
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:27,880
Hey, come to see the play.

297
00:18:27,963 --> 00:18:29,171
I wouldn't understand it.

298
00:18:29,546 --> 00:18:31,838
Then, help me sell tickets
and you'll get the commission.

299
00:18:31,921 --> 00:18:32,880
All right.

300
00:18:37,505 --> 00:18:38,505
I'm not thirsty.

301
00:18:40,421 --> 00:18:41,546
Just hold it for me.

302
00:18:54,796 --> 00:18:56,796
I have two suggestions for you.

303
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,921
-One, go home--
-Third suggestion.

304
00:19:11,463 --> 00:19:13,796
Hubby, pick up the phone.

305
00:19:15,296 --> 00:19:17,296
Pick up the phone, Hubby.

306
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:20,296
Hubby, pick up the...

307
00:19:21,505 --> 00:19:23,630
I'm the wolf of the theater, Chieh.
Who's calling?

308
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:32,963
Ma'am.

309
00:19:34,005 --> 00:19:35,505
Thanks for your concern,

310
00:19:35,671 --> 00:19:37,463
but I have to be straight with you.

311
00:19:37,755 --> 00:19:39,130
I have never bought any insurance.

312
00:19:39,213 --> 00:19:41,088
Because it's hard
for my sorry life to end.

313
00:19:41,421 --> 00:19:42,713
Save your speech for...

314
00:19:42,796 --> 00:19:43,630
What?

315
00:19:59,755 --> 00:20:02,005
Sung Cheng-yuan's beneficiary?

316
00:20:02,713 --> 00:20:03,671
What does that mean?

317
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:18,255
Doesn't he know that my dad
changed the beneficiary to him?

318
00:20:22,463 --> 00:20:25,630
So he isn't really such a bad guy?

319
00:20:25,963 --> 00:20:26,838
I'm not hungry.

320
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:31,671
Eat it if I say so.

321
00:20:35,755 --> 00:20:36,630
That's impossible.

322
00:20:36,963 --> 00:20:38,380
He surely is a bad guy.

323
00:20:42,255 --> 00:20:45,130
Otherwise, why wasn't he sad
when my dad died?

324
00:20:53,921 --> 00:20:54,796
So...

325
00:20:56,671 --> 00:20:58,130
he must be a bad guy.

326
00:21:05,921 --> 00:21:07,255
TA-HEI

327
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,713
Hubby, pick up the phone.

328
00:21:10,963 --> 00:21:13,046
Pick up the phone, Hubby.

329
00:21:13,838 --> 00:21:16,255
Hubby, pick up the phone now.

330
00:21:17,505 --> 00:21:20,546
And he's the type of bad guy
with lousy acting skills.

331
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:22,296
Bali.

332
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,380
Bali

333
00:21:24,463 --> 00:21:26,046
The magical Bali

334
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:27,421
That's right. It's Bali.

335
00:21:29,088 --> 00:21:30,296
Shit, it's not the energy drink.

336
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:31,796
So you're Mr. Sung's kid.

337
00:21:32,505 --> 00:21:34,505
Hey, Chen.

338
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:37,088
Your profiles are similar.

339
00:21:37,171 --> 00:21:39,380
-I don't know why I'm wearing a sweater.
-It's Bali.

340
00:21:39,463 --> 00:21:40,796
What the hell are they rehearsing?

341
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,130
I arrived this morning...

342
00:21:42,755 --> 00:21:44,088
Happy Holidays.

343
00:21:44,421 --> 00:21:46,755
It was quite the hit 17 years ago.

344
00:21:46,963 --> 00:21:48,546
-Holiday, my ass...
-What do you want?

345
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:50,921
-The sweater makes it hot.
-Why don't you believe me?

346
00:21:52,546 --> 00:21:54,546
Please help me
to borrow it from the hotel.

347
00:21:55,046 --> 00:21:56,588
I realized something.

348
00:21:56,838 --> 00:21:58,938
I don't want to do it.
You should do it yourself.

349
00:22:00,171 --> 00:22:02,171
I can't speak English.

350
00:22:02,755 --> 00:22:03,755
I don't want to.

351
00:22:08,838 --> 00:22:10,296
-Please.
-No way!

352
00:22:11,046 --> 00:22:13,005
I've seen this before.

353
00:22:17,046 --> 00:22:19,213
What an amazing balcony!

354
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:20,671
So this stupid play

355
00:22:22,463 --> 00:22:23,755
has something to do with my dad?

356
00:22:23,921 --> 00:22:26,630
You even complained that it was expensive
and want something cheaper.

357
00:22:26,713 --> 00:22:29,005
Good thing I insisted.

358
00:22:29,796 --> 00:22:31,755
Let me change to swimsuit then.

359
00:22:38,296 --> 00:22:40,088
Then I'll put on sunscreen.

360
00:22:44,046 --> 00:22:45,338
I think

361
00:22:46,255 --> 00:22:47,671
I'll find the answer soon.

362
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:54,146
Does it sound good?

363
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:58,713
A guitar would sound better.

364
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:02,505
Do you play the guitar?

365
00:23:03,796 --> 00:23:04,830
No.

366
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,896
Do you want to learn?

367
00:23:09,921 --> 00:23:11,546
-I do.
-Okay.

368
00:23:11,963 --> 00:23:14,113
Then no more car racing from now on.

369
00:23:15,505 --> 00:23:16,588
I will die a horrible death

370
00:23:16,671 --> 00:23:18,163
-if ever I do it again!
-Hey!

371
00:23:19,463 --> 00:23:20,796
Don't talk like that.

372
00:23:25,255 --> 00:23:26,380
All right.

373
00:23:27,421 --> 00:23:28,838
My brother already died.

374
00:23:29,546 --> 00:23:31,046
If I die as well,

375
00:23:31,421 --> 00:23:33,338
I think my mom will go crazy.

376
00:23:37,796 --> 00:23:39,796
All right. No more car racing for me.

377
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,063
Can you teach me how to play the guitar?

378
00:24:02,755 --> 00:24:04,788
I guarantee you'll get paid
for the performance.

379
00:24:05,046 --> 00:24:06,921
You haven't even paid them
for the venue yet.

380
00:24:07,005 --> 00:24:08,063
You're ridiculous.

381
00:24:10,671 --> 00:24:12,505
Stage Director,
have you distributed the notes?

382
00:24:14,588 --> 00:24:16,880
We can finish off
the lighting cues tomorrow.

383
00:24:18,171 --> 00:24:20,421
All right. We'll rehearse
the next half tomorrow.

384
00:24:20,838 --> 00:24:21,921
We can do this!

385
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:25,688
Let me say this upfront.

386
00:24:25,963 --> 00:24:28,213
If I don't get paid first thing
at the rehearsal tomorrow,

387
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:29,921
I swear I'm leaving.

388
00:24:31,505 --> 00:24:32,963
Don't say that.

389
00:24:33,588 --> 00:24:34,663
Hey.

390
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:38,880
Look at your adorable little face.

391
00:24:38,963 --> 00:24:40,038
Chieh.

392
00:24:40,463 --> 00:24:42,963
-Chieh.
-I promise you will get your paycheck.

393
00:24:43,046 --> 00:24:44,063
Okay?

394
00:24:44,755 --> 00:24:47,505
Don't you lose any sleep over something
as shallow as money.

395
00:24:47,588 --> 00:24:48,671
Be good, okay?

396
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:55,713
I love the theater.

397
00:24:56,588 --> 00:24:58,005
I love you all.

398
00:25:01,088 --> 00:25:02,505
Love is everything.

399
00:25:39,546 --> 00:25:45,463
He's the bad guy.

400
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:46,646
He's...

401
00:25:50,255 --> 00:25:51,546
Why did you sell your motorbike?

402
00:25:54,171 --> 00:25:55,955
Don't you have my dad's insurance money?

403
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:17,396
Hey.

404
00:26:19,088 --> 00:26:20,296
Are you picking him up?

405
00:26:24,338 --> 00:26:26,255
What are you doing over there? Come here!

406
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:32,255
Cut it out and just go home with your mom.

407
00:26:32,671 --> 00:26:34,713
So you don't plan to come home?

408
00:26:36,838 --> 00:26:37,838
Great!

409
00:26:39,171 --> 00:26:40,838
Don't ever come back.

410
00:26:42,546 --> 00:26:44,255
What does that mean?
You're leaving him here?

411
00:26:44,338 --> 00:26:45,671
I'm not taking him!

412
00:26:46,421 --> 00:26:47,755
Sung Cheng-Кси.

413
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:51,338
Why are you doing this to me?

414
00:26:52,505 --> 00:26:54,046
He's the pervert

415
00:26:54,713 --> 00:26:56,963
who stole your dad's insurance money.

416
00:26:57,046 --> 00:26:58,921
He's our enemy!

417
00:26:59,463 --> 00:27:01,338
What are you doing here?

418
00:27:03,088 --> 00:27:04,163
Why...

419
00:27:04,505 --> 00:27:07,921
Why are you treating me like a foe
and choose to stay with our enemy?

420
00:27:08,005 --> 00:27:10,380
You're just trying to screw me over,
aren't you?

421
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:13,630
After all I've done for you--

422
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,130
I didn't ask you to do that.

423
00:27:19,546 --> 00:27:21,296
-Come home with me!
-No.

424
00:27:21,546 --> 00:27:23,380
-Then go live with your aunt.
-No.

425
00:27:23,463 --> 00:27:25,171
You can't stay with him. He's...

426
00:27:25,671 --> 00:27:27,213
a pervert.

427
00:27:27,546 --> 00:27:28,796
No. I'd rather die.

428
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:32,088
You keep talking about dying.
I'll die in front of you first.

429
00:27:32,171 --> 00:27:34,546
Please. If you want to die,
go die in your own home.

430
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:36,546
You...

431
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:56,380
He is Sung Cheng-yuan's son,
you should at least have a bit of decency.

432
00:27:57,755 --> 00:27:58,771
What?

433
00:28:02,921 --> 00:28:05,380
Wake him up tomorrow morning
at 6 a.m. for school.

434
00:28:06,796 --> 00:28:09,005
That's none of my business!
Take him and do it yourself!

435
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:12,838
Your lunch box is in the bag.
Don't eat those deep fried junk.

436
00:28:12,921 --> 00:28:14,088
It's too unhealthy.

437
00:28:14,171 --> 00:28:16,463
-How do you think your dad got cancer?
-Hey.

438
00:28:20,005 --> 00:28:22,421
You have to learn how to protect yourself.

439
00:28:24,213 --> 00:28:27,088
If you lay a finger on him, I swear...

440
00:28:30,171 --> 00:28:31,755
Let me tell you. I have no shame.

441
00:28:31,838 --> 00:28:34,238
He's your son.
Take him home and leave me out of it.

442
00:28:34,463 --> 00:28:35,963
I will cut your dick off!

443
00:28:39,463 --> 00:28:40,838
Take him home!

444
00:29:04,171 --> 00:29:05,188
Hey.

445
00:29:08,671 --> 00:29:10,421
Do you want me to call you a cab?

446
00:29:10,713 --> 00:29:11,846
No.

447
00:29:15,671 --> 00:29:17,963
So you're just going to sit here
for the rest of your life?

448
00:29:18,171 --> 00:29:19,296
That's none of your business.

449
00:29:25,505 --> 00:29:26,680
What's this?

450
00:29:29,671 --> 00:29:30,838
Your dad's pajamas.

451
00:29:31,171 --> 00:29:32,288
I don't need them.

452
00:29:38,213 --> 00:29:40,005
It's not manly to act tough.

453
00:29:41,505 --> 00:29:42,963
Don't you miss your dad?

454
00:29:44,963 --> 00:29:47,155
I'm sure Liu San-lien packed my clothes.

455
00:29:49,046 --> 00:29:50,221
Hey.

456
00:29:51,338 --> 00:29:52,671
What do you have against your mom?

457
00:29:52,755 --> 00:29:53,921
That's none of your business.

458
00:29:54,213 --> 00:29:55,421
Then why the hell are you here?

459
00:29:55,505 --> 00:29:56,880
To steal the insurance money.

460
00:29:57,921 --> 00:29:59,521
So it's a mother-and-son conspiracy.

461
00:30:00,296 --> 00:30:03,088
If I get the insurance money,
she'll send me to Canada for school.

462
00:30:03,171 --> 00:30:05,246
Then I can stay away
from her craziness forever.

463
00:30:12,963 --> 00:30:15,963
If you ever disrespect your mom again,
I'll kick your ass.

464
00:30:16,296 --> 00:30:17,630
Then why did you steal my dad?

465
00:30:31,338 --> 00:30:33,963
Your dad is gone.
I'm like your stepdad now.

466
00:30:34,505 --> 00:30:35,538
Or stepmom?

467
00:30:38,505 --> 00:30:41,438
At least I am your elder.
Have some respect when you talk to me.

468
00:30:41,588 --> 00:30:43,671
So did you start it or was it my dad?

469
00:30:44,046 --> 00:30:45,588
How old are you? You don't know shit.

470
00:30:45,671 --> 00:30:47,671
Yes, I don't. That's why
you have to tell me.

471
00:30:50,671 --> 00:30:52,630
I have nothing to say to a punk ass kid.

472
00:30:53,088 --> 00:30:55,021
You must be the one who seduced my dad.

473
00:30:55,505 --> 00:30:56,671
How do you know?

474
00:30:57,546 --> 00:30:58,796
You destroyed my family.

475
00:31:21,921 --> 00:31:23,046
Do you play the guitar?

476
00:31:27,255 --> 00:31:28,505
Your dad taught me how to play.

477
00:31:35,921 --> 00:31:37,296
He even wrote this song.

478
00:32:01,296 --> 00:32:03,796
Put your heart into it.

479
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:07,421
My heart's with you.
I don't have it anymore.

480
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:10,046
Treat it as if it were me.

481
00:32:15,463 --> 00:32:16,538
Listen.

482
00:32:18,421 --> 00:32:24,630
I long for the freedom you gave me

483
00:32:28,213 --> 00:32:29,838
My mom asked me who you were.

484
00:32:34,838 --> 00:32:37,130
Your teacher, roommate,
or colleague from the theater.

485
00:32:38,838 --> 00:32:40,421
I prefer to tell the truth.

486
00:32:43,588 --> 00:32:45,838
The truth will break your mom's heart.

487
00:32:46,963 --> 00:32:49,171
That's impossible.
My mom loves me so much.

488
00:32:54,171 --> 00:32:56,088
You're the only son she has now.

489
00:32:59,671 --> 00:33:01,838
Even if I like you, I still love her.

490
00:33:05,171 --> 00:33:06,921
Even if you don't tell her the truth,

491
00:33:07,588 --> 00:33:09,130
we are still ourselves.

492
00:33:11,588 --> 00:33:13,338
Then why can't we tell the truth?

493
00:33:21,713 --> 00:33:24,463
Not letting them be sad or worried

494
00:33:24,796 --> 00:33:26,213
is our responsibility.

495
00:33:30,796 --> 00:33:33,005
I don't understand
why she'd be sad if I love you.

496
00:33:35,796 --> 00:33:36,838
I don't get it either,

497
00:33:38,088 --> 00:33:39,630
but she will definitely be sad.

498
00:33:45,838 --> 00:33:46,838
Listen.

499
00:33:50,546 --> 00:33:51,838
Be good, okay?

500
00:34:12,838 --> 00:34:14,505
Are you hungry? I'll cook you supper.

501
00:34:16,421 --> 00:34:17,588
I want a steak.

502
00:34:18,963 --> 00:34:20,171
No problem.

503
00:34:20,796 --> 00:34:22,630
I bought two steaks yesterday.

504
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:26,963
And I also want spaghetti with clams.

505
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:30,755
White wine clam pasta.

506
00:34:31,755 --> 00:34:33,880
And that red soup.

507
00:34:36,255 --> 00:34:37,588
You ordered so many things.

508
00:34:37,671 --> 00:34:39,046
You better finish them all.

509
00:34:46,546 --> 00:34:47,880
And salad!

510
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:49,046
He's the bad guy.

511
00:35:50,796 --> 00:35:51,871
Right?

512
00:36:20,046 --> 00:36:21,421
Your hair is falling out in chunks.

513
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:24,005
It's clogging up the drain.

514
00:36:27,713 --> 00:36:30,921
It was already clogged the day I moved in.

515
00:36:33,796 --> 00:36:34,796
Be careful.

516
00:36:42,296 --> 00:36:44,880
Just shave it off and save us the trouble.

517
00:36:46,005 --> 00:36:47,080
Okay.

518
00:36:47,713 --> 00:36:48,846
I'll help you.

519
00:36:51,338 --> 00:36:52,713
It's better for me to be dead.

520
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:18,205
Come here.

521
00:37:31,005 --> 00:37:32,338
Look at yourself.

522
00:37:35,755 --> 00:37:37,130
Look!

523
00:37:47,963 --> 00:37:48,963
What are you doing?

524
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:51,713
Let's see who looks better
with a bald head.

525
00:37:54,338 --> 00:37:56,213
Stop it, Chieh!

526
00:38:00,088 --> 00:38:02,705
Are you afraid that you'll lose?
Are you afraid I'll win?

527
00:38:03,088 --> 00:38:05,063
I'm sick. Why should I compete with you?

528
00:38:05,088 --> 00:38:06,163
What's wrong?

529
00:38:07,213 --> 00:38:08,421
Are you afraid of losing?

530
00:38:08,671 --> 00:38:10,755
-Are you afraid of losing?
-Stop messing around, Chieh!

531
00:38:14,088 --> 00:38:18,713
Please stop.

532
00:38:58,088 --> 00:39:00,088
What are you doing here? It's so early.

533
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:02,046
Your son is in school already.

534
00:39:02,213 --> 00:39:03,246
I know.

535
00:39:03,963 --> 00:39:05,380
I followed him this morning.

536
00:39:05,463 --> 00:39:06,921
I saw him going to school.

537
00:39:08,213 --> 00:39:09,546
Crazy stalker.

538
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:11,338
No wonder he's so immature.

539
00:39:11,713 --> 00:39:14,630
I wasn't here to supervise.
That was why he was an hour late.

540
00:39:14,921 --> 00:39:16,705
You have to wake him up at 6 a.m. sharp.

541
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:20,171
It takes me half an hour to wake him up.
I thought I was going to have a stroke.

542
00:39:20,338 --> 00:39:21,505
So what?

543
00:39:21,588 --> 00:39:23,588
I went to bed at 4 a.m.
I have rehearsals later.

544
00:39:23,671 --> 00:39:24,813
Can you leave now?

545
00:39:25,421 --> 00:39:27,005
Where did he sleep last night?

546
00:39:27,255 --> 00:39:28,271
On the sofa.

547
00:39:28,588 --> 00:39:30,505
How could you let him sleep on a sofa?

548
00:39:30,588 --> 00:39:32,505
-Would you rather he slept with me?
-Hey!

549
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:35,338
At least give him some clean sheets.

550
00:39:37,463 --> 00:39:39,146
Never mind. I'll deal with this tomorrow.

551
00:39:39,338 --> 00:39:42,463
Tomorrow? Get someone
to take him away today, okay?

552
00:39:43,213 --> 00:39:44,921
When he sees these,

553
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:47,380
he'll stop being mad
and I'll take him home.

554
00:39:48,588 --> 00:39:49,588
Don't touch my stuff.

555
00:39:49,671 --> 00:39:51,713
-Your table is a mess.
-I said don't touch my stuff.

556
00:39:51,796 --> 00:39:53,880
-Your book--
-That's the book he didn't finish reading.

557
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:28,505
Tell Sung Cheng-Кси
that I put all his stuff here, okay?

558
00:40:28,588 --> 00:40:29,671
These are his workbooks.

559
00:40:29,755 --> 00:40:33,088
I forgot to bring his skin rash medicine.

560
00:40:33,171 --> 00:40:35,130
He must have been itching all night.

561
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:37,421
Let me tell you. Don't put too much.

562
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:40,880
It contains steroids.
Just put a light coat and it'll be enough.

563
00:40:40,963 --> 00:40:43,255
Please take your son home
and care for him yourself.

564
00:40:43,338 --> 00:40:44,546
Do you think I want this?

565
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:46,130
You stole both of my men.

566
00:40:46,213 --> 00:40:47,671
-I didn't steal anyone.
-Yes!

567
00:40:48,671 --> 00:40:49,713
You're so great!

568
00:40:57,755 --> 00:40:59,838
You didn't steal them,
yet you have it all.

569
00:41:01,838 --> 00:41:03,838
Let me tell you though.
I've already confirmed this.

570
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:06,630
Without the death
and household cancellation certificates,

571
00:41:06,713 --> 00:41:09,338
even if you are the beneficiary,
you won't be able to get the money.

572
00:41:10,338 --> 00:41:11,421
Where's the kitchen?

573
00:41:13,296 --> 00:41:15,446
In that case,
can you get out of my house now?

574
00:41:24,713 --> 00:41:25,788
Listen.

575
00:41:26,838 --> 00:41:28,005
There are organic salad,

576
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:31,588
soup and whole grain rice.

577
00:41:31,796 --> 00:41:32,921
I've prepared everything.

578
00:41:33,005 --> 00:41:35,046
When Sung Cheng-Кси gets home,
heat it up for him.

579
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:37,755
Who has time for that?
Heat it up yourself.

580
00:41:37,838 --> 00:41:39,046
Tell him you cooked this.

581
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:41,755
-Please.
-Who feeds their children these things?

582
00:41:44,963 --> 00:41:45,796
Listen.

583
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,963
You better cooperate with me
on the insurance claim.

584
00:41:48,046 --> 00:41:50,213
I can assure you.
You're not getting a single penny!

585
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:51,755
I will--

586
00:42:04,296 --> 00:42:06,005
I hate organic salad.

587
00:42:06,963 --> 00:42:08,588
I hate the sound of the vacuum cleaner.

588
00:42:10,713 --> 00:42:12,380
I hate my skin rash cream.

589
00:42:12,463 --> 00:42:13,713
I hate tuition classes.

590
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:18,588
I hate that everything has
to be put back to where it was.

591
00:42:20,296 --> 00:42:21,921
I hate how she says she's so pitiful.

592
00:42:25,463 --> 00:42:26,596
I hate

593
00:42:27,338 --> 00:42:28,705
that she loves money so much.

594
00:42:32,671 --> 00:42:34,088
Are you sure it's hate?

595
00:42:37,505 --> 00:42:39,588
Hating something
and having no power over something

596
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,171
are two different things.

597
00:42:44,046 --> 00:42:47,880
Bali

598
00:42:48,838 --> 00:42:53,380
The magical Bali

599
00:42:55,005 --> 00:42:58,671
How I long

600
00:42:59,421 --> 00:43:02,588
For your embrace

601
00:43:17,755 --> 00:43:21,838
So this is how it feels
to have no power over something.

602
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:50,146
You're welcome.

603
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:54,080
Thank you.

604
00:43:58,046 --> 00:44:00,005
When are you going to go home?

605
00:44:04,755 --> 00:44:05,771
Someday.

606
00:44:08,005 --> 00:44:10,263
You said you'd go home
when you see these things.

607
00:44:16,463 --> 00:44:18,880
Liu San-lien brought a bunch of grass.
Do you want to eat them?

608
00:44:19,046 --> 00:44:21,005
-No.
-I thought so.

609
00:44:21,838 --> 00:44:23,421
Is that what she feeds you every day?

610
00:44:24,130 --> 00:44:25,380
It's healthy.

611
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:27,921
Then go home. I eat junk food.

612
00:44:28,005 --> 00:44:31,205
-And everything I use is junk.
-Then why wouldn't my dad go home?

613
00:44:36,213 --> 00:44:38,505
Are you angry that your dad moved out?

614
00:44:39,338 --> 00:44:40,630
What a stupid question!

615
00:44:43,755 --> 00:44:47,463
If my dad left me and my mom for a man,
I'd flip out too.

616
00:44:48,296 --> 00:44:50,130
Why did you even ask then? What a retard.

617
00:44:52,088 --> 00:44:53,671
Respect your stepmom.

618
00:44:57,005 --> 00:44:58,080
Dumbass.

619
00:44:59,796 --> 00:45:01,588
Your dad called that being genuine.

620
00:45:03,005 --> 00:45:04,213
You're genuinely dumb.

621
00:45:12,505 --> 00:45:14,430
To be honest, your dad really loved you.

622
00:45:14,588 --> 00:45:16,921
Right. He made you the beneficiary.

623
00:45:21,338 --> 00:45:23,121
Did you read the letter he left for you?

624
00:45:28,630 --> 00:45:29,663
Never mind.

625
00:45:31,755 --> 00:45:32,921
It's too difficult for you.

626
00:45:33,005 --> 00:45:34,505
Let's see when you're a little older.

627
00:45:39,463 --> 00:45:40,963
Don't you know that Liu San-lien

628
00:45:42,671 --> 00:45:44,005
is really pitiful?

629
00:45:46,088 --> 00:45:47,121
I know.

630
00:45:47,755 --> 00:45:50,671
I also know that you
and your dad are pitiful too.

631
00:45:50,755 --> 00:45:52,271
You're the only one who's not.

632
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:56,880
It seems that way.

633
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:11,963
Solve 5(2-x)-(x-2)...

634
00:46:13,671 --> 00:46:14,755
What's the answer?

635
00:46:15,255 --> 00:46:16,755
You wouldn't know even if I told you.

636
00:46:30,005 --> 00:46:32,505
You're so good at math.
Do you know how long a million years is?

637
00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:36,421
-A million years is a million years.
-Wrong!

638
00:46:44,296 --> 00:46:46,171
A million years is...

639
00:46:47,796 --> 00:46:50,338
when someone you love tells you
he wants to be a normal person,

640
00:46:50,421 --> 00:46:51,588
then leaves you.

641
00:46:51,671 --> 00:46:53,880
From that day on, every day...

642
00:46:59,630 --> 00:47:01,046
is a million years.

643
00:47:08,255 --> 00:47:09,255
Bitch!

644
00:47:09,338 --> 00:47:12,130
-What are you doing?
-He doesn't love me.

645
00:47:12,213 --> 00:47:15,046
-All right.
-How dare he?

646
00:47:15,296 --> 00:47:18,421
-All right.
-Who the hell does he think he is!

647
00:47:18,671 --> 00:47:20,713
There are plenty of men out there.
You don't need him.

648
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:24,130
-His nose and chin are fake!
-All right.

649
00:47:24,213 --> 00:47:25,255
He...

650
00:47:25,963 --> 00:47:29,213
-All right.
-What's with him?

651
00:47:56,213 --> 00:47:58,171
Many millions of years later,

652
00:48:00,463 --> 00:48:01,713
my dad reappeared.

653
00:48:15,088 --> 00:48:17,963
Because he had decided to just be himself

654
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:19,713
in the remaining days of his life.

655
00:48:22,963 --> 00:48:24,505
From that day on,

656
00:48:25,255 --> 00:48:28,338
Liu San-lien 2.0 was born.

657
00:48:46,630 --> 00:48:48,546
He complained that my house is dirty.

658
00:48:49,255 --> 00:48:52,588
So he built a protective fort
to prevent me from bothering him.

659
00:48:52,838 --> 00:48:54,930
So he really isn't planning on going home.

660
00:48:55,255 --> 00:48:58,213
-If you don't pick him up, he can't--
-He doesn't even answer my calls.

661
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:09,796
It's kind of creative actually.

662
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:11,046
Look at the proportion!

663
00:49:14,213 --> 00:49:15,796
Didn't we also do that when we were kids?

664
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:18,671
We thought our moms would always be there
so we didn't know any better.

665
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:27,296
My place is a dump.
He doesn't like it here.

666
00:49:27,380 --> 00:49:29,655
Pick him up tonight.
I'm sure he'll go with you.

667
00:49:35,921 --> 00:49:37,463
What are you doing?

668
00:49:39,005 --> 00:49:42,130
How clean do you want my house to be
before you can leave?

669
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:46,463
Cheng-Кси is allergic to dust mites,
you have to clean the house every day.

670
00:49:51,130 --> 00:49:53,796
When the sun is out,
take out all the sheets and pillows

671
00:49:54,088 --> 00:49:55,630
and air them.

672
00:49:56,921 --> 00:49:58,463
Why is everything so dirty?

673
00:49:58,546 --> 00:50:00,821
You must turn the dehumidifier on daily.

674
00:50:01,963 --> 00:50:04,838
Why don't I just quit my job
and care for you two maniacs full-time?

675
00:50:05,630 --> 00:50:07,505
Sung Cheng-Кси cannot breathe in
cigarette smoke.

676
00:50:07,588 --> 00:50:09,088
And drinking will mess up your mind.

677
00:50:09,338 --> 00:50:12,755
Stop touching all my stuff, Auntie!
What would it take for you to leave?

678
00:50:12,838 --> 00:50:14,380
I'll bring the blanket dryer tomorrow.

679
00:50:14,588 --> 00:50:16,796
Will I be adopting Sung Cheng-Кси or what?

680
00:50:17,338 --> 00:50:19,213
How can anyone live here?

681
00:50:19,546 --> 00:50:21,671
I'm going to take off my pants
if you don't leave.

682
00:50:24,796 --> 00:50:26,255
What are you doing?

683
00:50:33,963 --> 00:50:36,255
Hubby, pick up the phone.

684
00:50:37,463 --> 00:50:39,338
Pick up the phone, Hubby.

685
00:50:40,213 --> 00:50:42,546
Hubby, pick up the phone now.

686
00:50:44,213 --> 00:50:45,546
Hubby--

687
00:50:51,130 --> 00:50:52,630
Can you leave now?

688
00:51:06,338 --> 00:51:09,380
Listen. Remember to tell Sung Cheng-Кси
to go to therapy tomorrow.

689
00:51:09,463 --> 00:51:12,088
-One hour of it is expensive. The school--
-I'm taking off my pants.

690
00:51:12,171 --> 00:51:15,755
-You're even doing this to a woman!
-I'm taking it off if you don't leave.

691
00:51:15,838 --> 00:51:16,913
-I...
-Mom?

692
00:51:18,046 --> 00:51:19,838
Gosh, you found me.

693
00:51:20,630 --> 00:51:21,855
Never mind me.

694
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:22,921
Do your thing.

695
00:51:22,946 --> 00:51:24,309
Go do your thing.

696
00:51:25,504 --> 00:51:27,770
Thank you for taking care of Kao Yu-chieh.

697
00:51:29,130 --> 00:51:30,796
His brother passed away
when he was little.

698
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,931
He is basically an only child.

699
00:51:33,255 --> 00:51:35,255
That's why
he's a little immature sometimes.

700
00:51:35,377 --> 00:51:36,947
He still acts like a boy.

701
00:51:37,338 --> 00:51:39,288
Thank you for putting up with him.

702
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:40,630
No. I...

703
00:51:41,223 --> 00:51:43,398
I just do what I can.

704
00:51:45,421 --> 00:51:47,463
I haven't even asked your name.

705
00:51:47,588 --> 00:51:49,421
My name is Liu San-lien.

706
00:51:49,796 --> 00:51:53,088
The same Chinese character
as the one for lotus.

707
00:51:54,005 --> 00:51:56,338
-I'm not your son's girlfriend though.
-What a coincidence!

708
00:51:57,171 --> 00:51:58,880
I sell flowers in the market.

709
00:51:59,671 --> 00:52:02,396
Those that sell for 100 dollars
used for praying in temples.

710
00:52:02,421 --> 00:52:05,088
When it's in season,
I sell a lot of lotus flowers.

711
00:52:07,130 --> 00:52:09,318
That is quite a coincidence.

712
00:52:10,755 --> 00:52:12,671
My phone number's written on it.

713
00:52:12,755 --> 00:52:14,275
Yes.

714
00:52:14,465 --> 00:52:17,263
Call me if you need anything.

715
00:52:25,255 --> 00:52:26,833
Ma'am.

716
00:52:29,005 --> 00:52:32,338
Your son and I have
a special kind of relationship,

717
00:52:32,421 --> 00:52:34,463
but I am not his girlfriend.

718
00:52:35,028 --> 00:52:36,338
I know.

719
00:52:36,796 --> 00:52:38,571
Take your time.

720
00:52:39,046 --> 00:52:41,634
It's actually better for the woman
to be older.

721
00:52:41,713 --> 00:52:44,043
I'm not one of those old-fashioned folks.

722
00:52:44,421 --> 00:52:46,963
Nowadays, they're always talking

723
00:52:47,046 --> 00:52:49,925
about men who love men
and women who love women.

724
00:52:50,718 --> 00:52:54,677
I used to worry about Chieh
not having a girlfriend.

725
00:52:56,213 --> 00:52:58,255
I feel at ease now that I saw you.

726
00:52:58,338 --> 00:53:00,150
YANG КсиU-YING

727
00:53:03,505 --> 00:53:04,719
Hey.

728
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:06,344
How many tickets do you want?

729
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:08,171
-How much is it for one?
-Five hundred dollars.

730
00:53:08,255 --> 00:53:09,255
That's expensive.

731
00:53:09,588 --> 00:53:11,005
Plays are expensive.

732
00:53:12,713 --> 00:53:15,105
-I might have to ask my mom about it.
-How many tickets?

733
00:53:15,130 --> 00:53:17,010
-One.
-Two.

734
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:21,855
-How many?
-What's that?

735
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:23,496
-Tickets for a play.
-What's a play?

736
00:53:23,521 --> 00:53:24,562
How many do you want?

737
00:53:24,587 --> 00:53:26,240
-One.
-Two.

738
00:53:26,668 --> 00:53:27,883
So...

739
00:53:28,005 --> 00:53:29,921
you think he's a good guy?

740
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:41,281
Where do people go after they die?

741
00:53:47,713 --> 00:53:49,195
What do you think?

742
00:53:52,514 --> 00:53:54,486
Can they hear us talk?

743
00:53:59,171 --> 00:54:01,450
Do you want your dad to hear us?

744
00:54:06,647 --> 00:54:08,919
Can I get my mom to have therapy with you?

745
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:16,139
Do you want your mom to have therapy?

746
00:54:27,755 --> 00:54:29,097
Why?

747
00:54:29,505 --> 00:54:31,362
Because she's really annoying.

748
00:54:31,421 --> 00:54:33,938
Oh gosh. Please use your imagination...

749
00:54:33,963 --> 00:54:35,755
If you don't get him here,
I'll go in myself.

750
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:36,980
-What's happening?
-Hey!

751
00:54:37,005 --> 00:54:39,588
You gay asshole who stole my husband,
listen carefully!

752
00:54:39,613 --> 00:54:42,880
-Ma'am, we're having a rehearsal!
-Humans shouldn't be so harsh.

753
00:54:43,067 --> 00:54:45,559
The heavens might not tolerate you.

754
00:54:45,584 --> 00:54:47,834
Your brother drowned to death
when he was three, didn't he?

755
00:54:48,296 --> 00:54:51,213
Your mom has only you left.

756
00:54:51,296 --> 00:54:53,463
If you don't want your mom to go crazy,

757
00:54:53,546 --> 00:54:56,546
you have three days to give me
Sung Cheng-yuan's insurance money.

758
00:54:56,630 --> 00:54:59,282
Otherwise, I'll make sure she knows

759
00:54:59,307 --> 00:55:02,713
that her precious son, Chieh,
is a shameless fag.

760
00:55:08,134 --> 00:55:09,822
Why do you love money so much?

761
00:55:15,671 --> 00:55:18,551
Did you marry Dad for his insurance money?

762
00:55:26,319 --> 00:55:27,794
Yes.

763
00:55:28,505 --> 00:55:31,671
I'm just waiting to get
Sung Cheng-yuan's money and his house.

764
00:55:31,921 --> 00:55:34,963
I was waiting for him to die.
I married him for his insurance money.

765
00:55:34,988 --> 00:55:37,105
All I care about is money.

766
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:38,707
Why are you my mom?

767
00:55:38,732 --> 00:55:40,293
Sung Cheng-Кси!

768
00:55:49,005 --> 00:55:50,191
Yes.

769
00:55:50,630 --> 00:55:51,933
Why is that?

770
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:55,394
I really want to know too.

771
00:56:11,416 --> 00:56:13,748
Get your ass back to your home right now.

772
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:17,564
I said get the hell out of here,
do you hear me?

773
00:56:20,421 --> 00:56:21,563
You're so annoying.

774
00:56:21,588 --> 00:56:22,963
Both of you!

775
00:56:31,671 --> 00:56:33,296
Treat every rehearsal as the actual show.

776
00:56:33,321 --> 00:56:35,112
Why are you all fucking standing here?

777
00:56:37,296 --> 00:56:39,213
Sung Cheng-yuan left me
millions of dollars.

778
00:56:39,238 --> 00:56:41,198
Didn't you fucking hear it?

779
00:56:44,209 --> 00:56:46,567
Can you go back
to being professionals now?

780
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:47,910
Fuck.

781
00:56:47,935 --> 00:56:50,341
Can we do our best
for the premiere tomorrow?

782
00:56:50,380 --> 00:56:52,341
Can we do that?

783
00:56:55,546 --> 00:56:56,823
Stage Director.

784
00:56:56,848 --> 00:56:58,639
Where do we start?

785
00:57:01,724 --> 00:57:03,294
That's 1,099 dollars.

786
00:57:23,025 --> 00:57:26,483
I sacrificed so much for this family.
Is that wrong?

787
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:31,606
I worked hard to be a good wife and mom.

788
00:57:31,631 --> 00:57:34,588
Then my husband became gay

789
00:57:35,338 --> 00:57:37,255
and my son went to live with the enemy.

790
00:57:37,338 --> 00:57:39,380
What kind of life is this?

791
00:57:58,130 --> 00:58:00,466
What did I do to deserve this?

792
00:58:02,796 --> 00:58:06,671
And I don't even get the insurance money.

793
00:58:08,372 --> 00:58:09,518
Is that fair?

794
00:58:09,551 --> 00:58:12,137
I thought good things
happen to good people.

795
00:58:13,403 --> 00:58:16,338
Is it because I haven't done enough?

796
00:58:17,546 --> 00:58:19,591
Or I'm not a good person?

797
00:58:27,489 --> 00:58:28,770
Okay.

798
00:58:32,963 --> 00:58:34,341
Then I'll be a bad person.

799
00:58:36,005 --> 00:58:37,487
I'll be really bad.

800
00:58:41,005 --> 00:58:43,362
I'll show you how bad I can be.

801
00:59:05,630 --> 00:59:08,546
Have some lemon juice.
I have something for you.

802
00:59:08,944 --> 00:59:10,855
Take it. Open it when you get home.

803
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,905
There are too many people here
at the market.

804
00:59:12,963 --> 00:59:14,921
Chieh's dad gave it to me.

805
00:59:15,630 --> 00:59:17,130
Let me get some flowers for Chieh.

806
00:59:17,155 --> 00:59:19,131
Please take them with you
when you drop by.

807
00:59:31,130 --> 00:59:32,850
I can't take it.

808
00:59:36,463 --> 00:59:37,480
Take it.

809
00:59:37,505 --> 00:59:38,796
It's okay. It's not expensive.

810
00:59:38,821 --> 00:59:40,208
It's just a small gift.

811
00:59:40,783 --> 00:59:43,741
That's why I can't take it.
I'm not your son's girlfriend.

812
00:59:43,921 --> 00:59:47,630
-I know. No rush. I told you--
-I'll never be your son's girlfriend.

813
00:59:47,655 --> 00:59:49,614
No woman ever will.

814
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:53,669
Because your son doesn't like women.

815
01:00:01,896 --> 01:00:04,522
Your son is a husband-stealing gay man.

816
01:00:06,671 --> 01:00:08,194
He stole my husband.

817
01:01:12,538 --> 01:01:13,747
Please come in.

818
01:01:17,317 --> 01:01:18,688
Hello, Mrs. Sung.

819
01:01:18,713 --> 01:01:20,223
How is Sung Cheng-Кси?

820
01:01:21,255 --> 01:01:22,396
He just left.

821
01:01:22,421 --> 01:01:23,756
What did he say to you?

822
01:01:24,575 --> 01:01:26,326
We're communicating well.

823
01:01:31,838 --> 01:01:34,460
If I also come for therapy,
can you give me a discount?

824
01:01:36,311 --> 01:01:37,458
I'd recommend

825
01:01:37,483 --> 01:01:39,545
-another therapist for you.
-Can I do it now?

826
01:01:40,866 --> 01:01:42,920
-In 30 minutes, I--
-I'll be quick.

827
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:59,038
They forced me to do it.

828
01:02:19,275 --> 01:02:21,312
Are you fighting with Sung Cheng-yuan?

829
01:02:23,713 --> 01:02:25,406
I wish we could fight.

830
01:02:25,463 --> 01:02:28,130
He hasn't been home for weeks.
He doesn't even answer my calls.

831
01:02:32,131 --> 01:02:33,882
Do you think he's seeing someone else?

832
01:02:38,587 --> 01:02:40,581
When was the last time you guys did it?

833
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:42,136
That's not it.

834
01:02:42,296 --> 01:02:44,041
He teaches in Taichung.

835
01:02:44,066 --> 01:02:45,730
Cheng-Кси is all grown up.

836
01:02:45,755 --> 01:02:47,588
And we've been married for so long.

837
01:02:48,546 --> 01:02:50,755
That's the root of all problems.

838
01:02:51,665 --> 01:02:54,046
Why do you think your brother-in-law
and I had four kids

839
01:02:54,071 --> 01:02:55,602
despite his playboy lifestyle?

840
01:02:57,546 --> 01:03:00,463
Sung Cheng-yuan is a professor.
He's handsome too.

841
01:03:02,546 --> 01:03:05,630
Did you really think
luck would always be on your side?

842
01:03:07,255 --> 01:03:08,884
Work hard for it.

843
01:03:10,505 --> 01:03:12,330
Don't make him divorce you.

844
01:03:15,546 --> 01:03:18,839
Don't just lie there like a dead fish.

845
01:03:20,963 --> 01:03:22,546
Be more aggressive!

846
01:03:23,421 --> 01:03:25,027
Be more slutty!

847
01:03:27,463 --> 01:03:30,347
If it goes well in bed,
it'll go well everywhere, you know?

848
01:03:38,612 --> 01:03:40,058
You're off work?

849
01:03:41,046 --> 01:03:42,926
Why did you suddenly come home?

850
01:03:43,505 --> 01:03:44,871
Are you busy later today?

851
01:03:45,005 --> 01:03:46,279
No.

852
01:03:46,671 --> 01:03:49,005
Can we talk, please?

853
01:03:49,296 --> 01:03:51,258
Let me find something first.

854
01:03:52,588 --> 01:03:53,796
I miss you.

855
01:03:55,029 --> 01:03:56,546
Cheng-Кси will see us.

856
01:03:56,630 --> 01:03:58,271
He went to tuition class.

857
01:04:07,005 --> 01:04:08,630
Can we please just talk?

858
01:04:08,713 --> 01:04:10,355
How about...

859
01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:12,171
we listen to music and have some wine?

860
01:04:12,713 --> 01:04:13,755
Don't...

861
01:04:13,780 --> 01:04:15,537
San-lien, please don't do this.

862
01:04:26,631 --> 01:04:28,121
I'm moving out.

863
01:04:43,591 --> 01:04:46,091
Look! This bra is sexy.

864
01:04:46,171 --> 01:04:49,063
My sister brought me to buy it.
She said men like this. Look!

865
01:04:49,088 --> 01:04:50,458
San-lien, no.

866
01:04:50,630 --> 01:04:52,296
Or maybe I can get a boob job?

867
01:04:52,380 --> 01:04:53,812
-Look.
-That's not the issue.

868
01:04:53,837 --> 01:04:56,777
What's the issue then?
Tell me. Where did I go wrong?

869
01:04:56,802 --> 01:04:58,146
What can I improve on?

870
01:04:58,171 --> 01:05:00,796
-Teach me. You like hearing me moan.
-It's not your fault, it's mine.

871
01:05:00,821 --> 01:05:02,521
Don't you? I'll moan today.

872
01:05:02,546 --> 01:05:03,996
I like men!

873
01:05:15,636 --> 01:05:17,074
I'm homosexual.

874
01:05:28,421 --> 01:05:31,386
I thought that if I try hard enough,
I could be normal.

875
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:37,166
-All these years, I really--
-I don't mind.

876
01:05:41,181 --> 01:05:42,605
I forgive you.

877
01:05:42,630 --> 01:05:43,855
We can go and see a doctor.

878
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:45,105
We'll get you back to normal.

879
01:05:45,130 --> 01:05:46,814
We can work this out together.

880
01:05:46,839 --> 01:05:48,646
I won't tell anyone that you like men.

881
01:05:48,671 --> 01:05:51,380
We can still be
the happy family people envy.

882
01:05:51,497 --> 01:05:53,775
It's not up to others
to define a happy family.

883
01:05:54,588 --> 01:05:56,255
Are you really happy

884
01:05:57,272 --> 01:06:00,255
-being Sung Cheng-yuan's wife?
-I can change.

885
01:06:03,046 --> 01:06:05,003
I can learn.

886
01:06:05,838 --> 01:06:07,880
And then I'll be happy.

887
01:06:09,255 --> 01:06:11,963
You can change and learn too.

888
01:06:15,630 --> 01:06:18,688
I learned a lot from the movies.
I'll surely satisfy you today.

889
01:06:18,713 --> 01:06:20,505
San-lien, don't do this.

890
01:06:20,809 --> 01:06:22,796
I swear you'll like it.

891
01:06:23,421 --> 01:06:25,012
Don't do this!

892
01:06:25,255 --> 01:06:26,473
I'm sorry.

893
01:06:44,713 --> 01:06:46,081
I got

894
01:06:47,046 --> 01:06:49,132
the divorce papers ready.

895
01:06:51,999 --> 01:06:54,755
My parents' house,
this house, my savings...

896
01:06:54,838 --> 01:06:57,070
You can have whatever you want.

897
01:06:57,916 --> 01:07:00,156
He has never been honest with me
from the very start.

898
01:07:00,181 --> 01:07:01,588
He lied to me.

899
01:07:02,588 --> 01:07:03,796
And I was so stupid.

900
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:05,821
I believed him my entire life.

901
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:08,847
Good thing I have a son.
Sung Cheng-Кси can be with me.

902
01:07:08,872 --> 01:07:11,247
Otherwise, what do you think I should do?

903
01:07:11,921 --> 01:07:15,421
From the very start, everything was a lie.

904
01:07:16,338 --> 01:07:18,213
I went to his house that day.

905
01:07:19,313 --> 01:07:21,296
You'll see when I'm done.

906
01:07:21,380 --> 01:07:23,820
-Don't cut it!
-I think I look handsome.

907
01:07:24,255 --> 01:07:25,920
I like you with long hair.

908
01:07:30,005 --> 01:07:31,436
Sung Cheng-yuan.

909
01:07:33,630 --> 01:07:35,630
My son needs to grow up properly.

910
01:07:35,929 --> 01:07:37,718
So listen carefully.

911
01:07:38,255 --> 01:07:41,380
Don't tell Sung Cheng-Кси about this.

912
01:07:44,213 --> 01:07:46,209
Sung Cheng-yuan, do you hear me?

913
01:07:47,380 --> 01:07:50,505
Karma will find you. You know that?

914
01:07:53,005 --> 01:07:55,014
I will not agree to the divorce.

915
01:08:07,588 --> 01:08:08,975
Are you okay?

916
01:08:09,005 --> 01:08:10,576
Do you want to rest?

917
01:08:12,005 --> 01:08:13,628
There's no need.

918
01:08:15,255 --> 01:08:16,784
I'm fine.

919
01:08:22,463 --> 01:08:24,021
It's been so long.

920
01:08:24,046 --> 01:08:26,039
I'm way over it.

921
01:08:27,963 --> 01:08:29,188
I mean, he's dead.

922
01:08:29,213 --> 01:08:31,921
Why would I still hold a grudge, right?

923
01:08:37,005 --> 01:08:38,813
I just have one little question.

924
01:08:38,838 --> 01:08:40,213
I thought about it for so long.

925
01:08:40,296 --> 01:08:42,149
I still can't figure out.

926
01:08:42,421 --> 01:08:44,046
Just this one little question.

927
01:08:45,296 --> 01:08:48,088
Can you tell me?
You're a doctor. You're smart.

928
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:50,059
Can you please tell me?

929
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:53,695
I'll try my best.

930
01:09:01,171 --> 01:09:03,033
Was all of it a lie?

931
01:09:08,263 --> 01:09:10,130
Was there no love at all?

932
01:09:12,338 --> 01:09:13,380
Not...

933
01:09:16,630 --> 01:09:17,755
even

934
01:09:18,713 --> 01:09:20,005
a little bit?

935
01:09:49,380 --> 01:09:51,278
I thought I told you to scram.

936
01:09:52,380 --> 01:09:53,755
I have something to say to you.

937
01:09:55,046 --> 01:09:56,607
Say it.

938
01:09:57,880 --> 01:09:59,662
Are you going to say it or not?

939
01:09:59,713 --> 01:10:01,857
I read the letter my dad wrote me.

940
01:10:16,187 --> 01:10:17,437
Go home.

941
01:10:18,338 --> 01:10:20,544
Thank you for taking care of my dad.

942
01:11:11,088 --> 01:11:12,630
<i>Mom, come here.</i>

943
01:11:13,046 --> 01:11:14,630
<i>Hurry!</i>

944
01:11:15,588 --> 01:11:16,630
<i>Now!</i>

945
01:11:16,963 --> 01:11:17,963
<i>Hurry!</i>

946
01:11:18,046 --> 01:11:19,963
-Come here right now!
-Stop the bus!

947
01:11:21,544 --> 01:11:22,919
Excuse me!

948
01:11:26,838 --> 01:11:28,171
Excuse me!

949
01:11:35,296 --> 01:11:37,671
Sung Cheng-Кси, come on.
Go home with me right now.

950
01:11:37,755 --> 01:11:39,404
It's too dangerous here.

951
01:11:39,713 --> 01:11:41,063
-Sung Cheng-Кси! Why...
-Mom!

952
01:11:42,404 --> 01:11:44,130
Why won't you listen to me?

953
01:11:44,213 --> 01:11:45,296
Come with me!

954
01:11:59,050 --> 01:12:00,519
Call an ambulance!

955
01:12:02,339 --> 01:12:04,005
-Call an ambulance!
-Go away!

956
01:12:04,588 --> 01:12:06,296
Are you okay? I'm sorry!

957
01:12:07,505 --> 01:12:09,171
Sung Cheng-Кси, call an ambulance!

958
01:12:09,196 --> 01:12:11,271
-Call an ambulance!
-My friend's leg is broken!

959
01:12:11,296 --> 01:12:14,630
-Tell them he's dying!
-He's dying!

960
01:12:15,296 --> 01:12:16,662
Good morning!

961
01:12:18,921 --> 01:12:20,980
Guess what I smuggled in for you today?

962
01:12:21,005 --> 01:12:22,398
Steamed dumplings.

963
01:12:24,505 --> 01:12:26,877
I knew you want to eat steamed dumplings.

964
01:12:31,158 --> 01:12:32,580
What do you think?

965
01:12:33,463 --> 01:12:38,171
Some steamed dumplings in exchange
for a little liver transplant surgery.

966
01:12:39,338 --> 01:12:41,505
Don't you think it's a sweet deal?

967
01:12:42,488 --> 01:12:44,215
Your math is way off.

968
01:12:48,005 --> 01:12:49,505
Come on!

969
01:12:51,966 --> 01:12:53,296
Steamed dumplings...

970
01:12:56,588 --> 01:12:57,948
Steamed dumplings.

971
01:13:05,544 --> 01:13:06,877
Deal.

972
01:13:07,546 --> 01:13:08,775
Chieh.

973
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:13,650
Stop doing silly things.

974
01:13:14,755 --> 01:13:16,767
We don't have any money.

975
01:13:20,630 --> 01:13:21,997
I do.

976
01:13:22,546 --> 01:13:24,171
Where did you get the money from?

977
01:13:27,224 --> 01:13:28,833
Don't tell anyone.

978
01:13:31,380 --> 01:13:32,713
I won the lottery.

979
01:13:33,546 --> 01:13:34,949
It's no use.

980
01:13:35,097 --> 01:13:36,796
Stop wasting money on me.

981
01:13:40,588 --> 01:13:42,646
Do you think I'm doing this for you?

982
01:13:45,630 --> 01:13:47,615
Actually, I'm doing this for myself.

983
01:13:48,380 --> 01:13:50,921
So I want to keep you next to me

984
01:13:51,463 --> 01:13:56,963
for a really long, long time...

985
01:13:59,005 --> 01:14:00,313
I don't care.

986
01:14:00,338 --> 01:14:05,213
I'm going to keep you next to me
for a long, long time.

987
01:14:07,505 --> 01:14:10,171
Why did he borrow money
from those loan sharks?

988
01:14:10,380 --> 01:14:13,468
It's just a theater play.
How much money can it cost?

989
01:14:15,130 --> 01:14:16,515
Or is he gambling?

990
01:14:16,588 --> 01:14:18,125
Or doing drugs?

991
01:14:18,731 --> 01:14:20,355
No, this is too scary.

992
01:14:20,380 --> 01:14:23,146
You have to come home with me today.
Do you hear me?

993
01:14:25,046 --> 01:14:27,271
-Where are you going?
-The theater. It's opening night.

994
01:14:27,296 --> 01:14:29,521
-How can you perform?
-The audience doesn't know the story.

995
01:14:29,546 --> 01:14:31,963
-Your leg!
-I'm going on stage, even if it kills me!

996
01:14:49,838 --> 01:14:51,453
I told your mom about it.

997
01:15:07,921 --> 01:15:09,178
Ladies and gentlemen.

998
01:15:11,505 --> 01:15:14,963
Welcome aboard our flight to Bali.

999
01:15:17,296 --> 01:15:20,421
May I remind you

1000
01:15:22,296 --> 01:15:24,338
that there will be no stops

1001
01:15:26,046 --> 01:15:28,119
during this flight.

1002
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:31,994
-Now...
-Lights 1.3, get ready.

1003
01:15:32,019 --> 01:15:35,255
Let's begin our wonderful
vacation together.

1004
01:15:38,380 --> 01:15:39,711
Thank you.

1005
01:15:40,713 --> 01:15:43,796
Lights 1.3, go.

1006
01:15:47,463 --> 01:15:49,088
Lights 2.1, get ready.

1007
01:15:55,421 --> 01:15:57,109
What's that sound?

1008
01:15:57,671 --> 01:15:59,855
Never mind. Is Chieh in place?

1009
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:01,687
Lights, go.

1010
01:16:14,546 --> 01:16:16,505
What an amazing balcony!

1011
01:16:16,530 --> 01:16:17,880
Keep your voice down.

1012
01:16:17,963 --> 01:16:19,755
You're in a deluxe villa.

1013
01:16:22,421 --> 01:16:25,171
You get what you pay for.

1014
01:16:25,463 --> 01:16:27,838
Remember when you complained
about the price?

1015
01:16:28,171 --> 01:16:30,005
Good thing I insisted.

1016
01:16:30,838 --> 01:16:32,046
Yes.

1017
01:16:32,088 --> 01:16:33,546
Good thing you insisted.

1018
01:16:33,647 --> 01:16:36,255
-I don't know why he insisted to do this.
-Mom!

1019
01:16:37,796 --> 01:16:41,005
Ксиao-li, I think I found a drum.

1020
01:16:42,213 --> 01:16:43,963
Congratulations!

1021
01:16:44,838 --> 01:16:48,296
Did you hear some noise?

1022
01:16:48,713 --> 01:16:51,630
Yes, I think I heard something.

1023
01:16:55,088 --> 01:16:56,518
What's that?

1024
01:17:22,421 --> 01:17:23,796
Excuse me.

1025
01:17:24,463 --> 01:17:25,921
Excuse me, is anybody there?

1026
01:17:26,213 --> 01:17:27,463
-Yes?
-I'm sorry.

1027
01:17:27,546 --> 01:17:28,838
I want to get my package.

1028
01:17:29,713 --> 01:17:31,630
We're closed though.

1029
01:17:32,700 --> 01:17:34,356
Can you please help me?

1030
01:17:36,755 --> 01:17:38,838
I'm really sorry. It's like this.

1031
01:17:39,005 --> 01:17:42,338
Your people delivered it to me today,
but I wasn't home.

1032
01:17:42,421 --> 01:17:44,713
But it's something that I need
to use tomorrow morning.

1033
01:17:50,869 --> 01:17:52,307
Good thing I ran into you.

1034
01:17:52,332 --> 01:17:53,938
Otherwise, I'd be in big trouble.

1035
01:17:53,963 --> 01:17:55,255
What are these?

1036
01:17:55,588 --> 01:17:57,505
Musical instruments. Listen.

1037
01:18:01,880 --> 01:18:03,394
I don't get it.

1038
01:18:09,380 --> 01:18:10,942
Here, you can have this.

1039
01:18:12,171 --> 01:18:13,644
Wind chimes?

1040
01:18:13,921 --> 01:18:15,120
No,

1041
01:18:15,713 --> 01:18:17,908
it's heavenly-sounding wind chimes.

1042
01:18:24,838 --> 01:18:26,909
Rest a bit, everyone. Come get your drink.

1043
01:18:27,255 --> 01:18:30,713
Thank you, Professor Sung.

1044
01:18:30,796 --> 01:18:32,188
Is the director here?

1045
01:18:32,213 --> 01:18:34,462
-I'm already here.
-Director.

1046
01:18:34,487 --> 01:18:35,938
This just got in yesterday.

1047
01:18:35,963 --> 01:18:37,838
-Let's try it out!
-Gosh!

1048
01:18:38,338 --> 01:18:40,463
-I thought we're doomed.
-It's so nice.

1049
01:18:45,046 --> 01:18:46,283
Who's he?

1050
01:18:46,567 --> 01:18:47,713
That guy?

1051
01:18:47,880 --> 01:18:50,296
He is Professor Sung Cheng-yuan.
He does our music for us.

1052
01:18:50,796 --> 01:18:52,563
He also teaches computing
at the university.

1053
01:18:52,588 --> 01:18:55,088
He's a really nice guy.
He writes our music for free every time.

1054
01:18:56,463 --> 01:18:57,892
Music?

1055
01:18:59,923 --> 01:19:01,619
He's so talented.

1056
01:19:02,454 --> 01:19:04,046
No eating on the catwalk.

1057
01:19:04,130 --> 01:19:05,931
Has no one ever told you that?

1058
01:19:14,005 --> 01:19:16,213
Have you been sleeping here
for the last couple of days?

1059
01:19:16,296 --> 01:19:18,796
I live in Linkou.
It's a waste of time to go back and forth.

1060
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:20,746
I won't be late if I stay here.

1061
01:19:29,171 --> 01:19:30,316
Fuck.

1062
01:19:30,546 --> 01:19:32,683
I'll surely sleep well tonight.

1063
01:19:39,005 --> 01:19:40,792
Professor Sung.

1064
01:19:49,671 --> 01:19:51,446
Can I kiss you?

1065
01:19:52,796 --> 01:19:57,338
Bali

1066
01:19:59,838 --> 01:20:05,046
The magical Bali

1067
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:12,546
How I long

1068
01:20:14,267 --> 01:20:17,517
For your embrace

1069
01:20:22,963 --> 01:20:27,630
How long must I wait?

1070
01:20:29,338 --> 01:20:34,630
My body is weary

1071
01:20:35,923 --> 01:20:40,255
Don't cover my eyes

1072
01:20:42,546 --> 01:20:49,463
Take me

1073
01:20:49,630 --> 01:20:53,963
To you

1074
01:21:25,671 --> 01:21:27,958
I need a normal wife.

1075
01:21:29,421 --> 01:21:31,423
And a normal marriage.

1076
01:21:51,963 --> 01:21:53,516
Sung Cheng-yuan.

1077
01:21:57,046 --> 01:21:58,626
Sung Cheng-yuan.

1078
01:22:03,046 --> 01:22:04,630
Sung Cheng-yuan!

1079
01:22:08,788 --> 01:22:10,521
Step on it and break it.

1080
01:22:10,546 --> 01:22:12,671
I wish you prosperity upon this marriage!

1081
01:22:12,696 --> 01:22:14,813
Where are the firecrackers?
Who's lighting them?

1082
01:22:14,838 --> 01:22:16,713
Light them when the bride arrives. Hurry!

1083
01:22:16,738 --> 01:22:18,380
I don't have a lighter. Who's got one?

1084
01:22:18,463 --> 01:22:21,588
-Anyone got a lighter?
-Who has got a lighter?

1085
01:22:21,613 --> 01:22:23,018
-I do.
-Get the groom.

1086
01:22:23,043 --> 01:22:25,206
-The groom has a lighter!
-Get the groom inside!

1087
01:22:25,231 --> 01:22:26,897
Go inside!

1088
01:22:28,255 --> 01:22:30,573
-Come and get ready!
-Light the firecrackers!

1089
01:22:38,630 --> 01:22:40,094
Tina.

1090
01:22:41,713 --> 01:22:44,338
Tina, your voice
and your name sounds familiar.

1091
01:22:45,088 --> 01:22:46,963
Have we met before?

1092
01:22:48,130 --> 01:22:49,365
What?

1093
01:22:49,630 --> 01:22:50,857
Hello?

1094
01:22:52,130 --> 01:22:53,296
Tina.

1095
01:23:03,873 --> 01:23:06,671
Tina, are you still there?

1096
01:23:07,458 --> 01:23:08,497
Hello?

1097
01:23:08,522 --> 01:23:10,939
Is this Ms. Liu San-lien?

1098
01:23:28,088 --> 01:23:30,796
Can you come to the hospital now?

1099
01:23:44,546 --> 01:23:45,963
Can you please

1100
01:23:49,796 --> 01:23:51,926
come see Sung Cheng-yuan

1101
01:23:55,838 --> 01:23:57,213
for the last time?

1102
01:24:00,329 --> 01:24:02,605
The lover borrowed a lot of money
from bad guys

1103
01:24:02,630 --> 01:24:04,917
to get my dad a liver transplant.

1104
01:24:08,005 --> 01:24:11,338
However, one month after the surgery,
my dad coughed up a lot of blood.

1105
01:24:15,213 --> 01:24:17,013
I was in class that day.

1106
01:24:19,046 --> 01:24:20,963
During the entire class,
my stomach ached...

1107
01:24:22,380 --> 01:24:23,838
really badly.

1108
01:24:26,630 --> 01:24:28,718
And then they told me

1109
01:24:30,671 --> 01:24:32,293
that my dad had died.

1110
01:24:57,588 --> 01:24:58,671
Go.

1111
01:25:01,130 --> 01:25:02,947
Go talk to him.

1112
01:25:06,463 --> 01:25:07,463
No.

1113
01:25:11,463 --> 01:25:12,630
Why?

1114
01:25:15,380 --> 01:25:17,046
Hatred makes it easier to heal.

1115
01:25:17,755 --> 01:25:18,991
Bullshit.

1116
01:25:19,755 --> 01:25:21,315
Love makes it easier to heal.

1117
01:25:22,255 --> 01:25:23,880
Maybe after the surgery is successful.

1118
01:25:25,963 --> 01:25:28,046
After the successful surgery,

1119
01:25:30,005 --> 01:25:31,655
I will definitely

1120
01:25:32,588 --> 01:25:33,976
talk to him.

1121
01:25:37,171 --> 01:25:38,838
After the surgery is successful.

1122
01:25:42,588 --> 01:25:45,546
-After the surgery is successful.
-How magical

1123
01:25:47,255 --> 01:25:50,380
You should know

1124
01:26:04,588 --> 01:26:07,938
-Bali
-Bali

1125
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:12,255
-The magical Bali
-The magical Bali

1126
01:26:12,338 --> 01:26:13,505
-Bali
-Bali

1127
01:26:13,588 --> 01:26:16,255
-How I long
-How I long

1128
01:26:16,796 --> 01:26:19,130
-For your embrace
-For your embrace

1129
01:26:22,380 --> 01:26:24,213
How long must I wait?

1130
01:26:24,296 --> 01:26:26,338
-How much longer
-How much longer

1131
01:26:26,421 --> 01:26:28,338
My body is weary

1132
01:26:28,421 --> 01:26:30,505
-It's so weary
-It's so weary

1133
01:26:30,588 --> 01:26:34,872
-Take me
-Take me

1134
01:26:34,897 --> 01:26:38,688
-To you
-To you

1135
01:26:50,505 --> 01:26:53,421
-Bali
-Bali

1136
01:26:53,505 --> 01:26:54,588
-Bali
-Bali

1137
01:26:54,671 --> 01:26:56,838
-How magical
-How magical

1138
01:26:56,921 --> 01:26:57,921
A shooting star!

1139
01:26:58,005 --> 01:26:59,130
-Where?
-There.

1140
01:26:59,213 --> 01:27:00,463
Make a wish!

1141
01:27:02,296 --> 01:27:03,583
Me too.

1142
01:27:39,713 --> 01:27:41,671
Today is the 100th day
since your dad's death.

1143
01:27:49,421 --> 01:27:51,088
What did you guys wish for?

1144
01:28:00,532 --> 01:28:02,969
He said he wants to be
with my dad forever.

1145
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:06,202
Now,

1146
01:28:06,227 --> 01:28:08,671
he can finally say goodbye
to my dad properly.

1147
01:31:14,296 --> 01:31:15,733
Hello, doctor.

1148
01:31:16,296 --> 01:31:18,278
I won't be seeing you anymore.

1149
01:31:20,099 --> 01:31:22,551
My mom said all doctors are scammers,

1150
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:24,938
especially therapists.

1151
01:31:24,963 --> 01:31:27,127
You're expensive, yet you're useless.

1152
01:31:30,505 --> 01:31:33,130
However, I've been getting along better
with Liu San-lien recently.

1153
01:31:33,880 --> 01:31:36,171
Other than infuriating me last week,

1154
01:31:36,755 --> 01:31:37,804
we haven't fought

1155
01:31:37,829 --> 01:31:39,996
-for a whole month.
-You don't put your exam sheets away.

1156
01:31:40,046 --> 01:31:41,798
Don't tell me you'll review them.

1157
01:31:42,213 --> 01:31:45,338
You never use the workbooks I bought.

1158
01:31:47,713 --> 01:31:50,171
Grow up, will you?
You have to aim high in life.

1159
01:31:50,838 --> 01:31:52,849
Stop making me angry all the time, okay?

1160
01:31:53,171 --> 01:31:54,338
Grow up.

1161
01:31:58,463 --> 01:32:00,921
We stopped contacting Chieh afterwards.

1162
01:32:01,718 --> 01:32:05,385
My mom said that distance
is the best gift for all of us.

1163
01:32:10,416 --> 01:32:11,817
However...

1164
01:32:13,059 --> 01:32:16,171
...she secretly gave
the insurance money to Chieh.

1165
01:32:29,963 --> 01:32:31,480
Thank you, Auntie!

1166
01:32:31,505 --> 01:32:32,880
Who are you calling Auntie?

1167
01:32:33,463 --> 01:32:35,088
Do you want to take your grass back?

1168
01:32:35,113 --> 01:32:36,796
-I don't eat grass.
-How rude.

1169
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:39,124
-I wonder what Sung Cheng-yuan saw in you.
-Hey.

1170
01:32:40,358 --> 01:32:41,855
Auntie!

1171
01:32:41,880 --> 01:32:43,880
-Miss, your fried chicken chop.
-So

1172
01:32:45,296 --> 01:32:47,270
the final winner

1173
01:32:48,005 --> 01:32:49,731
is fried chicken chop.

1174
01:32:51,973 --> 01:32:53,684
What would you like to order?

1175
01:32:53,755 --> 01:32:55,109
Two fried chicken chops.

1176
01:32:55,134 --> 01:32:57,830
Two fried chicken chops.
Sure. Just a moment.

1177
01:32:58,713 --> 01:33:01,078
How much is it?

1178
01:33:09,564 --> 01:33:11,015
That's all

1179
01:33:12,243 --> 01:33:13,773
I've got to say.

1180
01:33:14,255 --> 01:33:16,630
I want to tell you thank you.

1181
01:33:16,713 --> 01:33:18,146
I wish you prosperity.

1182
01:33:18,171 --> 01:33:19,809
Yours truly, Sung Cheng-Кси.

1183
01:33:22,380 --> 01:33:24,671
The Bali of my dreams

1184
01:33:26,046 --> 01:33:28,796
How magical

1185
01:33:29,255 --> 01:33:30,921
You should know

1186
01:33:34,296 --> 01:33:35,639
What are you laughing at?

1187
01:33:36,130 --> 01:33:38,255
You're amazing. Every key is off.

1188
01:33:39,130 --> 01:33:40,338
How should I sing it then?

1189
01:33:40,421 --> 01:33:41,713
Like this.

1190
01:33:41,796 --> 01:33:45,130
Bali

1191
01:33:47,429 --> 01:33:50,804
The Bali of my dreams

1192
01:33:51,088 --> 01:33:53,255
-That's how I sang it.
-Of course not.

1193
01:33:53,397 --> 01:33:55,230
That's exactly how I sang it before.

1194
01:33:55,255 --> 01:33:56,838
-As if.
-Bali

1195
01:33:57,813 --> 01:34:00,271
-The Bali of my dreams
-You're singing it wrong.

1196
01:34:00,296 --> 01:34:03,630
-How should I sing it then?
-Bali

1197
01:34:05,588 --> 01:34:07,505
-Do it again.
-You're totally off.

1198
01:34:07,671 --> 01:34:08,713
I'm not.

1199
01:34:08,921 --> 01:34:11,338
Ba...

1200
01:34:11,421 --> 01:34:13,796
-Bali
-Bali

1201
01:34:13,963 --> 01:34:16,086
-Bali
-You're totally off-key.

1202
01:34:20,171 --> 01:34:23,588
Ladies and gentlemen.
Welcome aboard our flight to Bali.

1203
01:34:23,671 --> 01:34:26,546
We're currently cruising
at thirty-six thousand feet...

1204
01:34:26,666 --> 01:34:34,666
