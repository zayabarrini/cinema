1
00:02:22,334 --> 00:02:23,709
Dharmendra!

2
00:02:23,792 --> 00:02:25,292
- Pick up these plates!

3
00:02:25,376 --> 00:02:27,667
Bring the potatoes
out when they're done.

4
00:02:27,834 --> 00:02:30,834
- Have you cleaned the bathroom?
It was filthy yesterday!

5
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:37,251
- Dharmendra!

6
00:02:37,417 --> 00:02:40,417
- Hang the clothes
to dry... the sun's out!

7
00:02:43,917 --> 00:02:45,459
Do you need anything, Dad?

8
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:51,126
Forget your papers for a
minute and concentrate on him...

9
00:02:51,292 --> 00:02:54,417
He's been rehearsing
his death for a week now.

10
00:02:54,501 --> 00:02:55,959
You think he listens to me?

11
00:02:56,084 --> 00:02:58,292
As if me saying anything
will make a difference...

12
00:02:58,667 --> 00:02:59,584
What the hell?

13
00:02:59,667 --> 00:03:02,251
Don't pour the damn tea
so close to the accounts papers!

14
00:03:02,334 --> 00:03:03,792
Ridiculous...

15
00:03:05,042 --> 00:03:06,792
All we have are accounts papers.

16
00:03:06,876 --> 00:03:08,417
God alone knows when
we'll see some money.

17
00:03:08,501 --> 00:03:11,834
It'll come when these
snide comments stop.

18
00:03:13,501 --> 00:03:14,834
Did you see this?

19
00:03:14,917 --> 00:03:16,834
Last month's electricity bill.

20
00:03:16,917 --> 00:03:18,292
6,478 rupees...

21
00:03:18,376 --> 00:03:20,042
Just one month,
not the whole year!

22
00:03:20,126 --> 00:03:22,751
Can't switch the damn
TV off for a second!

23
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:24,001
"No money, no money!"

24
00:03:24,167 --> 00:03:25,292
I have an idea...

25
00:03:25,376 --> 00:03:26,792
Let's get rid of
the lights and fans...

26
00:03:26,917 --> 00:03:27,917
No electricity, no bill!

27
00:03:28,001 --> 00:03:30,834
I said TV- Why can't
you give a straight answer?!

28
00:03:31,292 --> 00:03:33,167
By the way,
have you called the plumber?

29
00:03:34,126 --> 00:03:35,084
Oh, don't worry...

30
00:03:35,167 --> 00:03:36,959
The tap's only been
leaking for 3 days now...

31
00:03:37,042 --> 00:03:39,001
We'll call him when
the house is a pool.

32
00:03:39,084 --> 00:03:40,292
His number's right here.

33
00:03:40,376 --> 00:03:42,459
You too could have called him.

34
00:03:43,126 --> 00:03:44,751
This is the limit...

35
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:46,834
Dharmendra!

36
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:49,084
Go see what's happened now!

37
00:03:50,834 --> 00:03:54,209
Day before he was lying in
the lawn with ketchup on his chest.

38
00:03:54,417 --> 00:03:55,876
- When the neighbours came to check...

39
00:03:56,001 --> 00:03:58,209
...he said let's go for dinner...
I mean, really!

40
00:04:02,667 --> 00:04:04,126
I don't know what to say, Rahul!

41
00:04:04,209 --> 00:04:05,667
I don't know what
to tell the publishers!

42
00:04:05,751 --> 00:04:07,501
Your deadline is in two months!

43
00:04:07,626 --> 00:04:09,292
Listen, I'm just
re-working the ending...

44
00:04:09,376 --> 00:04:10,959
I'm fixing the plot points...

45
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:12,334
I wasn't quite happy with it.

46
00:04:12,417 --> 00:04:15,792
I've been a bit pre-occupied
with that Artist Retreat thing.

47
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:18,834
I'm happy for you that the
Artist Retreat is coming together.

48
00:04:18,917 --> 00:04:21,959
I really am happy and I
know that you can multi-task...

49
00:04:22,126 --> 00:04:25,042
But right now I need a moment
as your agent and not as your friend.

50
00:04:25,126 --> 00:04:25,876
Okay?

51
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:27,709
Listen, I'm not your friend;
I'm your agent...

52
00:04:27,792 --> 00:04:30,459
And as your agent I'm telling you,
that you're hot property right now.

53
00:04:30,542 --> 00:04:32,167
Your last book is
still on the shelves.

54
00:04:32,251 --> 00:04:34,209
I've got you a sweet
deal for this new book...

55
00:04:34,292 --> 00:04:37,126
If you miss that deadline,
you have to return the advance.

56
00:04:37,251 --> 00:04:38,251
Okay, I get it, I get.

57
00:04:38,334 --> 00:04:41,001
I promise in the next
20 days you'll have something.

58
00:04:41,167 --> 00:04:42,251
20 days!

59
00:04:42,417 --> 00:04:44,501
- 20 days.
- Oh, that reminds me...

60
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:48,334
I need you to sign these
for my friends who love your work...

61
00:04:48,417 --> 00:04:51,501
I don't know why,
but I just need you to sign them.

62
00:04:52,084 --> 00:04:53,626
Oh... Just give me a second...

63
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:54,792
It's my Dad.

64
00:04:54,876 --> 00:04:56,042
On! Say hi!

65
00:04:57,167 --> 00:04:58,417
Hi, Dad.

66
00:05:00,584 --> 00:05:01,709
What?!

67
00:05:03,001 --> 00:05:05,834
Hey, Mike!
Two vodka's coming up!

68
00:05:11,001 --> 00:05:13,751
Tonight's Ladies' Night!
You guys like the music?

69
00:05:14,001 --> 00:05:15,334
I'll tell the DJ!

70
00:05:15,501 --> 00:05:16,667
Cheers, guys!

71
00:05:16,792 --> 00:05:19,501
Don't drink and drive, alright?!
- Yeah, we'll be safe. Hey, Mike!

72
00:05:24,709 --> 00:05:25,584
- Hey, Mike!

73
00:05:32,001 --> 00:05:33,417
Working late tonight?

74
00:05:33,501 --> 00:05:35,542
Hey... Yeah,
just sending a few e-mails...

75
00:05:35,917 --> 00:05:38,417
- Okay. See you tomorrow!
- Bye, see you tomorrow Natalie...

76
00:05:38,501 --> 00:05:39,876
- Goodnight!
- Goodnight!

77
00:05:48,042 --> 00:05:49,251
Hello?

78
00:05:49,792 --> 00:05:51,126
Arjun, where are you, man?

79
00:05:51,251 --> 00:05:53,042
Why aren't you
answering your phone?

80
00:05:53,126 --> 00:05:54,501
Why? What happened?

81
00:05:54,584 --> 00:05:56,834
Dad called...
Dadu's had a heart attack...

82
00:05:56,917 --> 00:05:57,834
Shit...

83
00:05:58,334 --> 00:05:59,292
Is he okay?

84
00:05:59,376 --> 00:06:02,334
Yeah, he's stable now...
But he's still in the ICU...

85
00:06:02,876 --> 00:06:04,126
Why didn't they call me?

86
00:06:04,542 --> 00:06:05,501
Arjun...

87
00:06:05,751 --> 00:06:07,667
I don't have time
for your childishness.

88
00:06:07,917 --> 00:06:10,584
I'm taking an Air India
flight day after...

89
00:06:10,667 --> 00:06:11,459
It'll arrive at 2 pm.

90
00:06:11,542 --> 00:06:12,459
- And I checked...

91
00:06:12,542 --> 00:06:14,334
- If you take the 7.40 flight
from New Jersey...

92
00:06:14,417 --> 00:06:16,417
...we can leave
the airport together.

93
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:17,626
Hold on.

94
00:06:17,876 --> 00:06:21,709
7.40... New Jersey...

95
00:06:24,042 --> 00:06:25,209
Arjun...

96
00:06:25,417 --> 00:06:27,126
It's alright, man,
I can buy you the ticket...

97
00:06:27,459 --> 00:06:30,292
No need... I'll manage.
Bye.

98
00:06:31,542 --> 00:06:33,126
Okay fine... Bye.

99
00:06:56,709 --> 00:06:58,001
" Arjun!

100
00:07:07,417 --> 00:07:08,709
How are you?

101
00:07:14,292 --> 00:07:15,542
Where's your bag?

102
00:07:29,584 --> 00:07:30,792
Hello?

103
00:07:31,667 --> 00:07:32,917
Where are you'll?

104
00:07:33,126 --> 00:07:34,584
- We're already here...

105
00:07:35,584 --> 00:07:38,709
- Can't find the keys...
- They aren't under the mat.

106
00:07:40,792 --> 00:07:42,667
Ahh... Found it.

107
00:07:43,042 --> 00:07:44,667
- Okay see you'll soon.

108
00:07:48,084 --> 00:07:49,417
Hey, Geishu!

109
00:07:49,501 --> 00:07:52,459
Shake hands!
Yes! Good boy!

110
00:07:55,001 --> 00:07:56,209
What's up?!

111
00:07:57,334 --> 00:07:58,959
- Missed you...

112
00:08:41,792 --> 00:08:43,126
What?

113
00:08:50,126 --> 00:08:51,042
Rahul!

114
00:08:51,126 --> 00:08:51,709
Rahul!

115
00:08:51,792 --> 00:08:54,001
Arj- Oho!
Rahul!

116
00:08:54,542 --> 00:08:57,126
- How are you?
- How are you?

117
00:08:57,209 --> 00:08:59,126
So good to see you!

118
00:08:59,334 --> 00:09:01,751
What's this new look!

119
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:04,626
- How was the flight?
- It was alright!

120
00:09:05,292 --> 00:09:07,042
- His bag got left behind.
- Where's your bag?

121
00:09:07,126 --> 00:09:09,292
Actually, the airline lost my bags...

122
00:09:09,459 --> 00:09:11,667
Are you sure it was
the airline and not you?

123
00:09:12,584 --> 00:09:13,626
- How's Dadu?

124
00:09:13,792 --> 00:09:16,709
- Uhh... He's okay...
- He's old now, no...

125
00:09:16,792 --> 00:09:18,334
He'll be under observation
for a couple of days...

126
00:09:18,417 --> 00:09:19,501
Can we meet him now?

127
00:09:19,584 --> 00:09:20,501
- Now?
- Yeah...

128
00:09:20,584 --> 00:09:23,376
Visiting hours are over now...
Go see him in the morning.

129
00:09:23,501 --> 00:09:25,709
I'll stay there tonight.

130
00:09:25,792 --> 00:09:27,709
Oh God, Who did this?!

131
00:09:27,917 --> 00:09:29,334
Who's dirty shoe prints are these?

132
00:09:29,501 --> 00:09:31,459
- Mom... it's...

133
00:09:31,709 --> 00:09:33,042
Geishu! Bad dog!

134
00:09:33,126 --> 00:09:36,334
- Morn, he'll clean it up.
- The house rules are the same!

135
00:09:36,417 --> 00:09:38,459
- Nothing's changed!
- Where's Uncle?

136
00:09:38,667 --> 00:09:40,084
- He's on a cruise...

137
00:09:40,209 --> 00:09:42,917
- No network 'til they dock.

138
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:45,334
How's work?

139
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:48,626
- I'll make it in two minutes!
- I'm going to shower.

140
00:09:48,792 --> 00:09:50,126
What's wrong?

141
00:09:50,876 --> 00:09:51,959
I made okra...

142
00:09:52,042 --> 00:09:54,459
Such a fussy boy...
I love okra!

143
00:09:55,167 --> 00:09:57,792
- What else did you make?
- Come, see...

144
00:09:58,084 --> 00:10:00,209
Who's going to clean this mess? Arjun!

145
00:10:01,417 --> 00:10:02,584
- Very nice.

146
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:07,792
So this is a place for
creative people to work in peace?

147
00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:08,959
Yup.

148
00:10:09,042 --> 00:10:11,417
- Nice.
- Artist Retreat...

149
00:10:11,709 --> 00:10:13,501
The investors are almost ready.

150
00:10:13,709 --> 00:10:15,584
How's the novel coming along?

151
00:10:16,084 --> 00:10:17,626
There's some work left...

152
00:10:17,876 --> 00:10:20,376
Actually, I'm lying...
There's a lot of work left.

153
00:10:20,584 --> 00:10:22,834
- God knows how you
manage so much work...

154
00:10:23,167 --> 00:10:25,126
- I owe it all to your okra.
- Drink?

155
00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:26,459
- Yeah...
- Arjun?

156
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:27,584
- Nah, thanks, Dad...

157
00:10:27,667 --> 00:10:29,292
Okay, Arjun... Apple pie?

158
00:10:30,292 --> 00:10:31,334
Did you make this?

159
00:10:31,417 --> 00:10:34,542
I did...but it's
Timmy Aunty's recipe...

160
00:10:35,876 --> 00:10:37,626
How's her catering business doing?

161
00:10:37,709 --> 00:10:38,917
- Oh, wonderful...

162
00:10:39,334 --> 00:10:43,542
In fact she thinks I
should open a branch here...

163
00:10:43,667 --> 00:10:45,001
- You should!
- Why not, Ma!

164
00:10:45,084 --> 00:10:46,376
- You should!
- Really?

165
00:10:46,501 --> 00:10:48,584
In fact, all her recipes are superb...

166
00:10:49,042 --> 00:10:50,584
They're not that great...

167
00:10:51,376 --> 00:10:53,376
- Cheers...
- Cheers, Dad...

168
00:10:54,001 --> 00:10:56,959
She earns your annual
income in 3 months...

169
00:10:57,042 --> 00:10:57,917
Here we go...

170
00:10:58,001 --> 00:11:01,126
So it makes no difference
if you think it's great or not...

171
00:11:01,876 --> 00:11:02,751
Morn...

172
00:11:02,917 --> 00:11:04,876
No no, but she's right!

173
00:11:05,292 --> 00:11:07,001
What difference does it make?

174
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:09,834
- It's really nice...

175
00:11:10,334 --> 00:11:11,459
There's lots more!

176
00:11:13,126 --> 00:11:14,584
- Arjun?

177
00:11:14,876 --> 00:11:16,917
You've only been on your
phone since you got here.

178
00:11:17,542 --> 00:11:19,292
- Why don't you talk to us a little...

179
00:11:19,417 --> 00:11:20,876
Or do you have nothing to say?

180
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,584
No, no... Tell me...

181
00:11:23,042 --> 00:11:25,167
How's the website job going?

182
00:11:26,459 --> 00:11:30,542
Ummm... I actually
quit that last month...

183
00:11:31,667 --> 00:11:32,751
- You quit?
- Why?

184
00:11:33,417 --> 00:11:34,792
I mean...

185
00:11:35,126 --> 00:11:36,167
- So now?

186
00:11:36,584 --> 00:11:38,709
Now, I'm concentrating
on my writing...

187
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:40,751
Finishing my novel...

188
00:11:41,334 --> 00:11:43,584
- Finishing?
- Yeah, almost...

189
00:11:44,667 --> 00:11:45,667
Great...

190
00:11:45,751 --> 00:11:46,751
- Good show!

191
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,126
Everyone in this
family's a novelist now.

192
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:53,584
Shouldn't you have asked before
taking such a big decision?

193
00:11:53,751 --> 00:11:55,376
- We could have discussed it?

194
00:11:55,459 --> 00:11:58,251
Dad... What do you know about my work?
What would I ask?

195
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:01,001
You're right...
What do I know about anything?

196
00:12:01,167 --> 00:12:02,334
- You could have asked Rahul!

197
00:12:02,417 --> 00:12:03,584
- Dad...
- Dad!

198
00:12:03,667 --> 00:12:04,876
Dad, please don't
interfere with my work...

199
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:06,251
I'm interfering?

200
00:12:06,501 --> 00:12:07,459
- Harsh...
- Talk properly...

201
00:12:07,542 --> 00:12:09,251
- Harsh!
- What "Harsh, Harsh"?!

202
00:12:09,334 --> 00:12:12,209
- The poor child just got here...
- He quits something every month...

203
00:12:12,292 --> 00:12:13,876
Stop, man, please!

204
00:12:13,959 --> 00:12:14,501
- Arjun...

205
00:12:14,584 --> 00:12:16,584
I'll eat in my room from now,
if all you'll do is pick on me

206
00:12:16,667 --> 00:12:18,209
Oh, sorry...
I don't have a room anymore, right?

207
00:12:18,459 --> 00:12:20,376
- Arjun!
- Arjun, it's just a few days, man...

208
00:12:20,459 --> 00:12:21,292
Sleep in my room!

209
00:12:21,376 --> 00:12:23,709
You seem to care more about
your room than your career.

210
00:12:23,792 --> 00:12:24,876
Dad!

211
00:12:25,167 --> 00:12:26,542
- Why do you guys do this Ma?
- What could I do?

212
00:12:26,626 --> 00:12:29,167
The doctor's told me
to sleep on a hard mattress...

213
00:12:29,292 --> 00:12:30,876
It's okay, Ma.

214
00:12:39,167 --> 00:12:41,417
I'm going back to the hospital...

215
00:12:41,667 --> 00:12:44,042
- Straight there?
- Yes, straight there.

216
00:12:44,792 --> 00:12:45,876
Ma...

217
00:12:46,751 --> 00:12:49,251
- ls there any green tea?
- Green tea?

218
00:12:49,834 --> 00:12:51,209
Since when do you drink green tea?

219
00:12:51,292 --> 00:12:52,917
I got you this...

220
00:12:54,417 --> 00:12:56,001
That's beautiful!

221
00:12:56,167 --> 00:12:58,501
- You like it?
- Of course!

222
00:12:59,042 --> 00:13:01,667
That's lovely...

223
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,709
- My perfect child.
- That I am...

224
00:13:08,917 --> 00:13:11,417
Can't believe the state of this car.
It looks like a junkyard..

225
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:13,959
<i>- By the Way"-</i>

226
00:13:14,167 --> 00:13:16,584
Morn said she shifted to your
room to sleep on a different mattress.

227
00:13:16,792 --> 00:13:18,209
But both the rooms
have the same mattress.

228
00:13:18,292 --> 00:13:19,501
What?!

229
00:13:19,751 --> 00:13:21,417
The same mattress in both rooms?!

230
00:13:21,626 --> 00:13:22,959
- What now, Sherlock?

231
00:13:23,126 --> 00:13:25,376
Dude... Morn and Dad
are sleeping separately.

232
00:13:25,459 --> 00:13:28,376
You would too if you lived in
the same room as Dad for 35 years.

233
00:13:28,459 --> 00:13:29,709
That's my pen, man!

234
00:13:29,834 --> 00:13:31,834
Leave this damn music
system and watch the road!

235
00:13:31,917 --> 00:13:33,459
If it bothers you so much
maybe you should learn how to drive.

236
00:13:33,542 --> 00:13:35,209
- I know how to drive...
- Yeah, right...

237
00:13:35,376 --> 00:13:37,167
I'm just not comfortable driving.

238
00:13:43,667 --> 00:13:44,417
What is this?!

239
00:13:44,501 --> 00:13:46,792
Toll is 30 rupees,
this is your change.

240
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:56,084
Oho!!! Stop moving!

241
00:13:56,167 --> 00:13:57,209
It tickles!

242
00:13:57,292 --> 00:13:59,542
How will she tie your gown?!

243
00:13:59,834 --> 00:14:01,167
Get lost, fatty!

244
00:14:01,251 --> 00:14:04,084
- Dad, what are you doing-
- She just wants to see me naked!

245
00:14:04,667 --> 00:14:05,459
Sorry, sorry...

246
00:14:05,542 --> 00:14:06,792
- Why am I wearing an apron?!

247
00:14:07,126 --> 00:14:10,917
I was an army man for 21 years!

248
00:14:11,042 --> 00:14:13,501
You'll get your pants
back when you're discharged!

249
00:14:13,584 --> 00:14:15,417
Yeah, right... Hey, fatty!

250
00:14:15,542 --> 00:14:16,417
Stop it, Dad...

251
00:14:16,626 --> 00:14:17,709
Dadu!

252
00:14:17,792 --> 00:14:18,542
There they are.

253
00:14:18,626 --> 00:14:20,459
Welcome, kids!

254
00:14:20,792 --> 00:14:23,501
Hey, hey! Don't you dare... Hands up!

255
00:14:23,834 --> 00:14:24,834
- I said, hands up!

256
00:14:24,917 --> 00:14:26,584
- This is a hospital, Dad...
- We're not kids anymore...

257
00:14:26,709 --> 00:14:27,709
Ahhhh!

258
00:14:27,917 --> 00:14:28,751
You also!

259
00:14:30,167 --> 00:14:31,376
Hey, fatty!

260
00:14:32,667 --> 00:14:34,292
- Die fatty die!

261
00:14:34,542 --> 00:14:35,917
Stupid fatty...

262
00:14:40,459 --> 00:14:41,917
Get up, kids...
Your mother's here...

263
00:14:42,042 --> 00:14:44,792
What are you two doing?!
Behaving like 5 year olds...

264
00:14:44,876 --> 00:14:46,209
Hello, Dadu...

265
00:14:46,542 --> 00:14:48,376
Welcome, welcome!

266
00:14:49,959 --> 00:14:51,417
Wow...

267
00:14:51,751 --> 00:14:52,709
- Excuse me!

268
00:14:52,792 --> 00:14:55,292
This hospital has a great
psychiatric department...

269
00:14:55,459 --> 00:14:56,667
- Please take him there!

270
00:14:58,334 --> 00:14:59,542
It's not funny, okay!

271
00:14:59,626 --> 00:15:01,209
- Oh, come on...
- Apologise to her!

272
00:15:01,334 --> 00:15:02,501
Sorry, you big fat cow!

273
00:15:02,667 --> 00:15:04,792
Who are you calling a cow?!

274
00:15:05,792 --> 00:15:08,709
- How was the flight?
- It was good, Dadu...

275
00:15:08,792 --> 00:15:11,876
Just latch this here, and prick...

276
00:15:11,959 --> 00:15:14,709
Ow, you idiot!
Are you trying to kill me?!

277
00:15:14,792 --> 00:15:16,709
You can check your
sugar without blood tests!

278
00:15:16,792 --> 00:15:19,126
- What kind of gift is this!
- Well, what do you want?!

279
00:15:20,126 --> 00:15:21,167
Dadu...

280
00:15:22,459 --> 00:15:25,209
What are you laughing at, rascal?
What did you get me?

281
00:15:27,251 --> 00:15:28,459
Urn... chocolate?

282
00:15:28,584 --> 00:15:29,917
- Chocolate!
- Arjun!

283
00:15:30,042 --> 00:15:32,084
His sugar has to go up
to use your lovely machine!

284
00:15:32,167 --> 00:15:33,084
Exactly!

285
00:15:33,167 --> 00:15:35,459
Arjun! What's going on?

286
00:15:37,209 --> 00:15:40,126
Make yourself useful...
Go make this payment...

287
00:15:40,209 --> 00:15:41,667
Yes, sir.

288
00:15:43,292 --> 00:15:44,584
Please wait.

289
00:15:49,209 --> 00:15:50,667
Hey, Wasim!

290
00:15:53,501 --> 00:15:54,917
Arjun!

291
00:15:55,542 --> 00:15:56,626
How are you, man?!

292
00:15:56,709 --> 00:15:57,959
When did you get here?
Should have called!

293
00:15:58,042 --> 00:16:00,084
I landed yesterday, man...

294
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:01,084
What are you doing here?

295
00:16:01,167 --> 00:16:02,417
Dadu had a heart attack...

296
00:16:02,501 --> 00:16:03,917
Dadu... He's alive?!

297
00:16:04,084 --> 00:16:06,542
- Ass! I'll hit you!
- How's he doing?

298
00:16:06,792 --> 00:16:08,959
He's okay now... What are
you doing here? All okay?

299
00:16:09,084 --> 00:16:11,542
Ummm... hemorrhoids...

300
00:16:12,542 --> 00:16:13,417
What?!

301
00:16:13,876 --> 00:16:15,584
Hemorrhoids, man!

302
00:16:17,417 --> 00:16:18,376
Don't laugh, jerk!

303
00:16:18,459 --> 00:16:20,626
You ran away to the US and I'm
stuck here doing photography!

304
00:16:20,709 --> 00:16:23,459
Rotting all day in dad's studio...
Smile and click, smile and click!

305
00:16:23,542 --> 00:16:24,792
You're chilling in life, man!

306
00:16:25,501 --> 00:16:27,626
Really?! Come to the studio
and see the stunners of Coonoor!

307
00:16:27,709 --> 00:16:28,959
Of course! Let's catch up soon!

308
00:16:29,042 --> 00:16:30,376
Come tonight!

309
00:16:30,459 --> 00:16:32,126
- Tonight...
- Remember Malik's bungalow?

310
00:16:32,209 --> 00:16:33,251
Malik...

311
00:16:34,542 --> 00:16:36,334
That's where the party is! Come!

312
00:16:36,459 --> 00:16:37,959
I can't, man... Family scene...

313
00:16:38,042 --> 00:16:40,126
How can you ditch a party, bro...

314
00:16:40,584 --> 00:16:43,209
Bro, isn't that your brother? Boobly?

315
00:16:43,292 --> 00:16:44,292
- What's he doing?!

316
00:16:44,501 --> 00:16:47,709
- Don't ask, man... He's training for some
Mr. Ooty bodybuilding competition...

317
00:16:47,792 --> 00:16:49,709
- Whose child is this?
- Hi, Boobly!

318
00:16:50,792 --> 00:16:53,792
Why don't you check out some
properties for your retreat here?

319
00:16:53,959 --> 00:16:56,501
- Why not?
- I'll talk to the broker.

320
00:16:56,626 --> 00:16:58,542
I said, switch off your phone!

321
00:16:59,584 --> 00:17:00,792
Yes... and put some adhesive there...

322
00:17:00,876 --> 00:17:02,876
- What's happening?
- And what about this leak here?

323
00:17:03,084 --> 00:17:06,209
He'll take care of it!
He's a professional, we're paying him!

324
00:17:06,417 --> 00:17:07,292
He'll handle it.

325
00:17:07,376 --> 00:17:09,667
- The bucket's full...
- I am aware.

326
00:17:10,376 --> 00:17:11,501
Take lessons... She knows everything.

327
00:17:11,584 --> 00:17:13,251
- Geishu! Put him down!

328
00:17:13,334 --> 00:17:14,959
Not on the sofa.. Put him down!

329
00:17:15,042 --> 00:17:17,792
Arjun! the doctor's calling...
Empty this bucket...

330
00:17:17,917 --> 00:17:19,959
Dad! I have to take Geishu for a walk...

331
00:17:20,042 --> 00:17:22,792
One second...
Arjun, don't be a useless fellow!

332
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,126
Morn told me to!

333
00:17:24,459 --> 00:17:25,876
Dad, I'm coming... Let it be.

334
00:17:26,251 --> 00:17:28,501
Come, Geishu!

335
00:17:29,584 --> 00:17:30,959
Tomorrow? Okay...

336
00:17:37,084 --> 00:17:38,209
Dad, I don't get it...

337
00:17:38,292 --> 00:17:40,542
If the doctors recommend
treating Dadu in Bangalore...

338
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:41,417
What's the problem?

339
00:17:41,501 --> 00:17:43,292
It's not so simple...

340
00:17:43,376 --> 00:17:46,667
It cost <i>7</i> lakh rupees
to put the stents in... 7!

341
00:17:46,792 --> 00:17:48,584
What happened to the advance
you were supposed to get?

342
00:17:48,709 --> 00:17:51,542
It's still bloody stuck!
It'll come... Just taking time...

343
00:17:51,667 --> 00:17:53,459
But don't worry... I'll talk to Shashi...

344
00:17:53,542 --> 00:17:55,334
How can you keep asking
your younger brother for money?!

345
00:17:55,417 --> 00:17:56,542
Have some shame!

346
00:17:56,626 --> 00:17:59,084
What's shameful about it!
We're both his sons!

347
00:17:59,167 --> 00:18:00,667
Yes, except he takes
care of all the expenses!

348
00:18:00,792 --> 00:18:02,709
And where does Dad stay?
He doesn't take care of that!

349
00:18:02,792 --> 00:18:04,376
- You'll are unbelievable,
you'll fight over anything!

350
00:18:04,459 --> 00:18:08,251
All Shashi's college expenses
were handled by me! Harsh Kapoor!

351
00:18:08,501 --> 00:18:10,167
- Morn, dad, please!

352
00:18:10,334 --> 00:18:13,126
No need!
We won't take money from Shashi.

353
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:15,376
- Where will the money come from?
- Break my fixed deposit.

354
00:18:15,459 --> 00:18:18,126
Sir! Can you please help?

355
00:18:19,292 --> 00:18:20,792
- I'm coming...
- Ma please don't break your FD

356
00:18:20,876 --> 00:18:21,792
- Just hold this, please.

357
00:18:21,876 --> 00:18:23,709
What a mess you've made!
What the hell are you doing?

358
00:18:23,792 --> 00:18:25,584
- I can help with the money...
- No no no!

359
00:18:25,667 --> 00:18:27,376
You've been talking about
your investment forever...

360
00:18:27,459 --> 00:18:29,209
- It's alright...
- Rahul! Get a cloth!

361
00:18:29,292 --> 00:18:30,876
Yes! Getting it...

362
00:18:35,542 --> 00:18:36,709
Why can't we break my deposit?

363
00:18:36,792 --> 00:18:38,792
I had to pay the loan installment!
Where would I get that?

364
00:18:38,876 --> 00:18:40,251
From your imaginary
catering business?!

365
00:18:40,334 --> 00:18:41,876
- That was my money!
- Yeah, right...

366
00:18:41,959 --> 00:18:43,751
I've been saving for
my business for 3 years!

367
00:18:43,834 --> 00:18:44,834
What were you saving?!

368
00:18:44,917 --> 00:18:47,001
The money I give you
to run the house, right?

369
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:47,542
So?

370
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:48,709
- How is that your money?
- Dad, stop it!

371
00:18:48,792 --> 00:18:49,501
Leave me!

372
00:18:49,584 --> 00:18:51,001
- Where did you spend it?
- Morn...

373
00:18:51,084 --> 00:18:53,084
- Your business is in the dumps.
- Stop behaving like children...

374
00:18:53,167 --> 00:18:55,459
- Did you give it to Anu?
- Stop your nonsense!

375
00:18:55,542 --> 00:18:57,792
Hold this. I said, hold this!

376
00:18:58,209 --> 00:18:59,334
Are you insane?

377
00:18:59,417 --> 00:19:01,626
You sit here and concoct
these wild fantasies in your head!

378
00:19:01,709 --> 00:19:02,626
Dad!

379
00:19:02,792 --> 00:19:04,167
Sir...

380
00:19:04,334 --> 00:19:05,376
Should I come later?

381
00:19:05,459 --> 00:19:07,792
- Oh, so Anu just happened
to get a new car?

382
00:19:07,917 --> 00:19:10,501
Smriti told me!
Where did Anu get that much money?

383
00:19:10,584 --> 00:19:12,667
- How would I know?!
- It just fell into her lap'?!

384
00:19:12,792 --> 00:19:15,084
Maybe it did!
Do I look like her accountant?

385
00:19:15,209 --> 00:19:18,001
- Get up now! Enough! Get out!
- Dad...

386
00:19:18,167 --> 00:19:20,042
Not a chance!
Sit down and finish your work!

387
00:19:20,126 --> 00:19:21,792
- I said get up!
' Stop it!

388
00:19:21,876 --> 00:19:24,001
Fix this leak!
And switch off your damn phone!

389
00:19:24,084 --> 00:19:25,792
What's happening?
Everyone's at it without me today?

390
00:19:25,876 --> 00:19:27,251
This isn't the time for jokes.

391
00:19:27,584 --> 00:19:31,001
Dad, Morn... I've told you
I have some money... I can invest later!

392
00:19:31,084 --> 00:19:33,001
- Who needs money?
- Just stay out of it...

393
00:19:33,167 --> 00:19:34,334
I'm talking to Morn!

394
00:19:34,417 --> 00:19:36,709
Your father has blown up all my money!

395
00:19:36,876 --> 00:19:38,126
Now we have to beg your uncle.

396
00:19:38,209 --> 00:19:39,626
Enough, Sunita! That's enough!

397
00:19:39,709 --> 00:19:41,376
- How much money do you need?
- You keep quiet.

398
00:19:41,459 --> 00:19:43,417
Arjun... I've told you already!

399
00:19:43,542 --> 00:19:46,626
We're discussing actual money and
not a packet of m&m's... Stay out of it!

400
00:19:46,709 --> 00:19:47,876
It's not like I live off you!

401
00:19:47,959 --> 00:19:50,459
Just shut up! All of you!
I'm tired of you'll!

402
00:19:50,542 --> 00:19:51,751
I was better off at Timmy's!

403
00:19:51,834 --> 00:19:53,042
That's a lovely idea, Sunita...

404
00:19:53,126 --> 00:19:56,209
Last time you went for <i>2</i> months...
Go for 6 months now!

405
00:19:56,292 --> 00:19:58,126
Dad, stop shouting...
Tell me what the problem is!

406
00:19:58,209 --> 00:20:00,834
Arjun, do me a favour.
Handle your own problems!

407
00:20:00,917 --> 00:20:03,501
- Why are you always taunting me?!
- I'm not taunting you!

408
00:20:03,584 --> 00:20:04,792
- I'm done, sir!

409
00:20:05,376 --> 00:20:07,209
- Done? How much?

410
00:20:07,334 --> 00:20:09,792
Anything you can spare
in these tough times...

411
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:12,917
- I'll slap this idiot...
- Dad, enough now!

412
00:20:13,084 --> 00:20:15,251
- Switch off your phone!
- It's your phone, Dad!

413
00:20:15,334 --> 00:20:17,292
I know it's my phone, I'm not deaf!

414
00:20:17,376 --> 00:20:18,542
Everyone thinks I'm
an idiot around here...

415
00:20:18,626 --> 00:20:20,167
You're not an idiot, I'm the idiot...

416
00:20:20,251 --> 00:20:21,751
No one's told me what's
happening since I got here!

417
00:20:21,834 --> 00:20:23,584
I'm always treated like an outsider!
Rahul, stop touching me!

418
00:20:23,667 --> 00:20:24,542
- Stay away!
- Arjun...

419
00:20:24,626 --> 00:20:26,292
I'm always the last to
find out what's happening here...

420
00:20:26,376 --> 00:20:28,334
You called Rahul to tell him
about Dadu... Not me! Why?!

421
00:20:28,417 --> 00:20:29,792
Because you always react like a child!

422
00:20:29,876 --> 00:20:31,834
- Shut up, Rahul!
- You shut up!

423
00:20:32,126 --> 00:20:32,959
Talk softly!

424
00:20:33,042 --> 00:20:35,834
Use your millions from
your "blog" to help out!

425
00:20:36,876 --> 00:20:38,792
You think you're a big shot
because you wrote some book?!

426
00:20:38,917 --> 00:20:40,459
Arjun! Stop!
Stop it!

427
00:20:40,542 --> 00:20:42,626
Only you and I know
the truth about you!

428
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:44,917
- I'll break his goddamn face!
- You've gone mad!

429
00:20:45,001 --> 00:20:47,501
Enough, mom! It's always me...

430
00:20:49,334 --> 00:20:51,251
- What are you doing?!
- What do you mean what am I doing?!

431
00:20:52,792 --> 00:20:54,459
All you'll want to
do is create a scene!

432
00:20:54,584 --> 00:20:56,376
Arjun... Arjun, listen, please...

433
00:20:56,459 --> 00:20:57,667
Arjun, listen to me!

434
00:20:57,751 --> 00:20:59,042
Morn, even you know he's a thief!

435
00:20:59,126 --> 00:21:01,417
You'll are both here
together after 5 years...

436
00:21:01,501 --> 00:21:03,417
Must you behave like bloody animals?!

437
00:21:03,501 --> 00:21:06,292
Everything's always my fault, Ma!
Rahul is totally innocent!

438
00:21:06,459 --> 00:21:08,917
And everything was
just a co-incidence?

439
00:21:10,667 --> 00:21:11,834
Arjun, listen...

440
00:21:25,709 --> 00:21:30,126
- Hi this is Wasim! Sorry,
can't talk now... Leave a message!

441
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:52,292
- Guys! Guys! Come on!

442
00:21:52,459 --> 00:21:54,501
- Someone bet on Sahil!

443
00:21:54,584 --> 00:21:55,876
- You Will?

444
00:21:55,959 --> 00:21:58,667
- What kind of friends
do you have, man?!

445
00:21:58,792 --> 00:22:00,709
Someone put money on me, guys...
I've known you'll for years!

446
00:22:00,792 --> 00:22:03,501
- Come on, guys!
- Come on, guys...

447
00:22:05,376 --> 00:22:09,459
One second, one second! Guys!
I believe in Sahil! Put money on him!

448
00:22:09,626 --> 00:22:12,209
He has core strength!

449
00:22:14,084 --> 00:22:18,376
Aww man! Kishore!
Kishore the fuse is out again!

450
00:22:18,501 --> 00:22:19,917
Fix it!!!

451
00:22:20,001 --> 00:22:22,667
- We love you, Kishore!
- Ya, we love you very much!

452
00:22:22,751 --> 00:22:25,959
Now, listen. I'm betting on Sahil.
Twenty bucks!

453
00:22:26,126 --> 00:22:28,542
Twenty bucks!!! Good job, T!

454
00:22:28,626 --> 00:22:31,167
I'm putting 20 bucks...
Excuse me, it's a lot of money!

455
00:22:31,251 --> 00:22:33,542
And he'll put money!
Come on!

456
00:22:33,667 --> 00:22:35,209
Come on, man!

457
00:22:35,417 --> 00:22:36,917
What the hell? Okay, you?

458
00:22:37,001 --> 00:22:39,084
Okay, excuse me.
You! He'll put money!

459
00:22:39,167 --> 00:22:41,126
He looks skinny,
but he has core strength!

460
00:22:41,209 --> 00:22:42,709
These guns have a lot of power!

461
00:22:42,834 --> 00:22:45,084
- Come on, come on!
- Alright... ya!

462
00:22:45,292 --> 00:22:46,417
Sahil! Ya? Ya!

463
00:22:49,667 --> 00:22:51,792
Sahil! Sahil! Sahil!

464
00:23:04,292 --> 00:23:06,167
Bunkoo,dude...
Your whole drink is on me!

465
00:23:06,376 --> 00:23:08,126
Shit...

466
00:23:09,417 --> 00:23:10,792
Bunkooo...

467
00:23:16,376 --> 00:23:18,459
Umm... sorry. I was just going out...

468
00:23:18,626 --> 00:23:22,167
I should be the one apologizing...
I lost your money!

469
00:23:22,501 --> 00:23:23,834
No, that's okay...

470
00:23:24,001 --> 00:23:27,334
Actually, I knew
Sahil has no core strength...

471
00:23:28,167 --> 00:23:29,834
Are you Sahil's friend?

472
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:33,292
Umm... No... I'm Wasim's friend...

473
00:23:33,667 --> 00:23:34,834
Wasim?

474
00:23:35,501 --> 00:23:38,084
He knows the owners of this place.

475
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:41,917
I'm the owner... I don't know Wasim.

476
00:23:42,209 --> 00:23:43,417
Oh! Umm...

477
00:23:43,501 --> 00:23:46,209
I was just trying to call Wasim,
but I couldn't get through...

478
00:23:46,292 --> 00:23:47,209
One second.

479
00:23:47,334 --> 00:23:51,584
You're sitting here rolling this...
Gatecrashing my party...

480
00:23:51,751 --> 00:23:54,126
Wasim must be here...
I couldn't find him...

481
00:23:54,209 --> 00:23:56,084
- Seriously?

482
00:23:56,167 --> 00:23:57,376
Couldn't get through to him?

483
00:23:57,459 --> 00:24:00,126
Kishore! Kishore!
Kishore throw this guy out!

484
00:24:00,292 --> 00:24:01,917
Okay, I'll leave! I'm sorry!

485
00:24:02,001 --> 00:24:04,084
- Can I take that?
- No no no, this is going to stay here...

486
00:24:04,167 --> 00:24:07,542
I'm sorry, I was just having
a really bad day, so I thought...

487
00:24:07,626 --> 00:24:10,459
I'm sorry, what? Seriously? Leave!

488
00:24:10,542 --> 00:24:12,042
- I'm sorry, I know you're upset...
- Leave!

489
00:24:12,126 --> 00:24:14,292
Ya, okay I'm leaving...

490
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:22,251
What's so funny?

491
00:24:23,251 --> 00:24:26,126
I'm so sorry!

492
00:24:26,501 --> 00:24:29,709
Shit... I was just kidding!
I'm sorry!

493
00:24:30,292 --> 00:24:32,376
It's supposed to be funny! I'm sorry!

494
00:24:32,501 --> 00:24:34,084
<i>-</i> Okay...
<i>-</i> Ya!

495
00:24:34,709 --> 00:24:36,751
- Listen, you're cool, right?
- Good one...

496
00:24:36,876 --> 00:24:37,584
Ya!

497
00:24:38,876 --> 00:24:41,126
- Do you have a lighter?
- Yeah, of course...

498
00:24:42,751 --> 00:24:44,709
- I'm Arjun.

499
00:24:44,876 --> 00:24:46,167
Tia... Tia!

500
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:47,667
- Hi...
- Hi!

501
00:24:54,876 --> 00:24:56,876
Why are you so troubled, Arjun?

502
00:24:58,751 --> 00:25:01,167
Don't ask...
I'm having such a rubbish day...

503
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:03,126
Fought with your girlfriend?

504
00:25:04,334 --> 00:25:05,251
Then?

505
00:25:06,834 --> 00:25:08,292
With my brother.

506
00:25:08,584 --> 00:25:09,792
Your butler?

507
00:25:09,959 --> 00:25:11,084
Not butler, brother!

508
00:25:12,084 --> 00:25:14,001
Why would I fight with a butler?

509
00:25:14,334 --> 00:25:15,542
Actually... yeah!

510
00:25:15,709 --> 00:25:17,959
And even if I did,
why would I sit here like this?!

511
00:25:18,126 --> 00:25:20,001
Point taken...

512
00:25:20,792 --> 00:25:23,751
This bungalow's been empty
for years... never seen you around...

513
00:25:23,834 --> 00:25:26,417
The tea state and this bungalow
belong to my grandfather...

514
00:25:26,542 --> 00:25:29,167
I've lived in Bombay since I was 5...
because of Dad's work.

515
00:25:29,251 --> 00:25:30,584
So, planning to shift here?

516
00:25:30,667 --> 00:25:32,167
No! Planning to rent it out!

517
00:25:32,542 --> 00:25:34,917
But my best friend Bunkoo's
boyfriend is from Ooty...

518
00:25:35,001 --> 00:25:37,584
So I had to have one last party!

519
00:25:38,792 --> 00:25:40,167
O...kay?!

520
00:25:40,292 --> 00:25:41,792
- Wasim!
- One second...

521
00:25:42,167 --> 00:25:43,667
Bro? Are you okay?

522
00:25:43,751 --> 00:25:44,542
Wasim!

523
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:46,292
Ya... Him! See? I was calling him?

524
00:25:46,459 --> 00:25:47,959
- Are you okay?
- Ya...

525
00:25:48,042 --> 00:25:49,126
- You okay, bro?
- Ya...

526
00:25:49,209 --> 00:25:50,542
False alarm.

527
00:25:50,709 --> 00:25:53,251
Wasim! Tia. Tia! Wasim.
- Hi Wasim!

528
00:25:53,376 --> 00:25:54,959
She's the owner of this place.

529
00:25:55,084 --> 00:25:56,501
What are you'll doing in the bathroom?

530
00:25:56,584 --> 00:25:58,209
- We were about to take a shower.
- What?!

531
00:25:59,292 --> 00:26:00,709
- Come on...
- Ya, one minute...

532
00:26:00,792 --> 00:26:01,917
- You okay, Wasim?
- I'm fine now.

533
00:26:02,001 --> 00:26:04,584
Tia! Come on,
let's get this party started!

534
00:26:04,667 --> 00:26:07,792
Okay! You're good?
Arjun, Wasim... let's go! Time to party!

535
00:28:49,959 --> 00:28:52,334
Guys! ls there an Arjun here?

536
00:28:52,542 --> 00:28:53,751
Ummm... me!

537
00:28:54,334 --> 00:28:55,834
Don't puke in the car, man!
Get out!

538
00:28:55,917 --> 00:28:57,209
I'll leave you here on the road!

539
00:28:57,417 --> 00:28:59,209
- What are you doing to me!

540
00:28:59,417 --> 00:29:02,584
- Man, couldn't you have
waited two minutes to throw up...

541
00:29:03,126 --> 00:29:04,834
- My day was finally
picking up at that party...

542
00:29:11,251 --> 00:29:13,584
The property agent's coming at 11.30.

543
00:29:13,792 --> 00:29:15,876
He'll show you some places...

544
00:29:16,417 --> 00:29:20,376
Then go see Dadu and tell
him we're taking him to Bangalore.

545
00:29:20,834 --> 00:29:22,876
I'll figure out the money with Shashi.

546
00:29:23,959 --> 00:29:26,292
- You want tea?
- No, thanks... I'm fine.

547
00:29:28,209 --> 00:29:29,417
- Dad...
- Ya?

548
00:29:31,167 --> 00:29:33,792
Why did Morn stay with
Timmy Aunty for <i>2</i> months?

549
00:29:34,501 --> 00:29:37,001
- She came back, right?
- That's not what I asked, Dad...

550
00:29:37,501 --> 00:29:39,084
To belittle me, what else...

551
00:29:39,167 --> 00:29:42,084
Timmy started her catering
business after her divorce...

552
00:29:42,167 --> 00:29:44,209
Morn thinks she can do it too.

553
00:29:44,792 --> 00:29:48,126
How can she compare me
to that bloody wife-beater?!

554
00:29:49,626 --> 00:29:52,084
Do I drink like Timmy's ex?

555
00:29:52,667 --> 00:29:54,751
Have I ever hit her?
Abused her?

556
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:57,084
Dad... Why do you always do this?

557
00:29:57,167 --> 00:29:58,626
You never listen to anyone.

558
00:29:58,751 --> 00:30:00,834
Morn only needs your
support... Nothing else.

559
00:30:00,917 --> 00:30:03,084
Really?
And what about me?

560
00:30:03,751 --> 00:30:06,209
Where was everyone
when I needed support?

561
00:30:07,209 --> 00:30:09,417
Everything was fine
'til I worked at the bank.

562
00:30:09,584 --> 00:30:12,501
I started this business
for you'll... For you. For her!

563
00:30:12,709 --> 00:30:13,792
What's wrong with that?

564
00:30:15,251 --> 00:30:17,792
There is a financial crisis.
What can I possibly do?

565
00:30:18,042 --> 00:30:19,417
Kill myself?

566
00:30:21,001 --> 00:30:22,334
Dad, please...

567
00:30:23,626 --> 00:30:24,959
I'm tired...

568
00:30:25,959 --> 00:30:29,209
I know... and you're a good man.

569
00:30:29,459 --> 00:30:31,376
Everything will be okay, I promise.

570
00:30:31,709 --> 00:30:33,126
Just one day at a time, okay?

571
00:30:35,209 --> 00:30:36,334
One day at a time...

572
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:37,917
Thanks,buddy.

573
00:30:43,959 --> 00:30:46,251
Sir, all of Coonoor's
best properties are with us.

574
00:30:46,334 --> 00:30:47,334
- Really?
- So don't worry...

575
00:30:47,417 --> 00:30:50,751
Yes, Mr. Makhija, somehow the
properties today didn't reflect that.

576
00:30:50,876 --> 00:30:52,126
You didn't like anything today, right?

577
00:30:52,209 --> 00:30:54,084
I'll have a fresh batch
ready for you tomorrow...

578
00:30:54,167 --> 00:30:57,042
Yes, please...
A quiet place for creative people...

579
00:30:57,209 --> 00:30:59,751
- Not abandoned, haunted houses.
- Thank you.

580
00:31:01,709 --> 00:31:02,459
Yeah, Nik!

581
00:31:10,501 --> 00:31:11,501
Woah!

582
00:31:12,501 --> 00:31:13,626
- Rahul...
- Arjun?!

583
00:31:14,001 --> 00:31:15,876
Dadu was getting bored, man...

584
00:31:16,001 --> 00:31:18,209
Ohh, just take him
to a disco then, bro.

585
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:19,917
Disco?

586
00:31:20,209 --> 00:31:22,334
The nurse is asking for
the reports... Go get them.

587
00:31:22,417 --> 00:31:23,959
Fine.

588
00:31:24,334 --> 00:31:26,209
- Dadu, I'm coming...
- This is a hospital!

589
00:31:26,292 --> 00:31:27,959
I want to go to a disco!

590
00:31:28,167 --> 00:31:29,376
- Tell me something...

591
00:31:30,584 --> 00:31:32,459
Why are you like this?

592
00:31:32,542 --> 00:31:33,584
Like what?

593
00:31:33,667 --> 00:31:35,292
Grumpy...

594
00:31:35,376 --> 00:31:40,084
Don't do this, don't do that,
not like this, not like that...

595
00:31:40,334 --> 00:31:43,376
Relax, son... Relax...

596
00:31:44,459 --> 00:31:45,917
Okay, I'm sorry...

597
00:31:46,834 --> 00:31:48,709
But trust me, whatever we do,
we do for you...

598
00:31:48,792 --> 00:31:50,417
That's true...

599
00:31:50,917 --> 00:31:54,209
And that's why, we're
taking you to Bangalore for treatment...

600
00:31:54,417 --> 00:31:57,751
I don't want to go anywhere!
I'm not going!

601
00:31:58,042 --> 00:32:01,001
Next week is my birthday!

602
00:32:01,417 --> 00:32:05,209
I want to celebrate
my birthday with my family.

603
00:32:05,292 --> 00:32:07,376
Happy Birthday, Dadu,
but your treatment is very important.

604
00:32:07,459 --> 00:32:10,459
- I don't want any treatment!

605
00:32:10,542 --> 00:32:13,667
I don't aspire to live much longer.

606
00:32:13,751 --> 00:32:16,167
When I go, I'll go like this -

607
00:32:22,709 --> 00:32:24,251
- I'm right, son...

608
00:32:25,042 --> 00:32:27,292
- But if you do want
to do something for me...

609
00:32:27,459 --> 00:32:29,292
Then I have two wishes.

610
00:32:29,459 --> 00:32:30,584
Which are?

611
00:32:31,251 --> 00:32:35,709
The first is that,
when I die, don't light my pyre.

612
00:32:37,167 --> 00:32:38,376
So, what, you'll just lie there?

613
00:32:38,459 --> 00:32:39,626
No, duffer!

614
00:32:39,959 --> 00:32:41,126
Bury me!

615
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:44,292
- With my friends from
my army regiment...

616
00:32:44,501 --> 00:32:46,292
In the army burial ground!

617
00:32:46,459 --> 00:32:48,209
Wow. And what's the other wish?

618
00:32:48,292 --> 00:32:56,292
The other one is, before I go,
I want a happy family photograph...

619
00:32:57,042 --> 00:32:59,792
- Which I can put on my wall...

620
00:33:00,167 --> 00:33:07,084
It should read -
'Kapoor and Sons, since 1921'.

621
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:11,334
Very nice... The creative juices
are really flowing today, huh?

622
00:33:11,417 --> 00:33:14,376
Well, when Uncle gets here,
we can fulfill this wish.

623
00:33:14,459 --> 00:33:15,542
Okay!

624
00:33:19,876 --> 00:33:20,917
Listen, man...

625
00:33:21,834 --> 00:33:24,917
We're here only for a few days...
Let's not fight...

626
00:33:27,334 --> 00:33:29,459
I'm sorry for last night.

627
00:33:39,376 --> 00:33:40,917
- Here you go...Your toll...

628
00:33:41,001 --> 00:33:42,292
- What?

629
00:33:44,292 --> 00:33:46,167
And this is for the hospital... Sorry.

630
00:34:03,334 --> 00:34:04,417
So you're showing me
some places tomorrow, right?

631
00:34:04,501 --> 00:34:05,709
- Rahul!
- I hope it's a nice place...

632
00:34:06,626 --> 00:34:07,417
Bye!

633
00:34:08,751 --> 00:34:10,167
- Yeah?
- Mom's calling you in.

634
00:34:10,251 --> 00:34:11,417
Okay... Thanks.

635
00:34:13,584 --> 00:34:14,792
- Listen!
- Yeah?

636
00:34:15,001 --> 00:34:17,042
She wants a couple of cigarettes...

637
00:34:17,584 --> 00:34:19,209
Ha ha, very funny...

638
00:34:19,376 --> 00:34:20,501
Want to share?

639
00:34:22,667 --> 00:34:23,834
Thanks.

640
00:34:26,959 --> 00:34:28,667
What did the doctors say?

641
00:34:29,834 --> 00:34:32,459
- What difference does it make?
Ask me what Dadu said.

642
00:34:32,542 --> 00:34:33,459
What?

643
00:34:33,667 --> 00:34:35,501
He wants to get discharged
and celebrate his birthday at home...

644
00:34:35,584 --> 00:34:36,751
Really?!

645
00:34:37,042 --> 00:34:38,792
It's his 90th birthday, man...

646
00:34:39,542 --> 00:34:40,667
Let's do something!

647
00:34:41,334 --> 00:34:43,542
Actually, I was thinking
of the same thing...

648
00:34:43,876 --> 00:34:48,709
Like a surprise 90th birthday party?
It'll be nice...

649
00:34:49,001 --> 00:34:51,459
With the beautiful
grannies of Coonoor?

650
00:34:52,292 --> 00:34:54,501
No, with Russian strippers
and caviar.

651
00:34:54,584 --> 00:34:55,626
Stupid...

652
00:34:55,792 --> 00:34:58,959
Dunno about caviar, but Russian
strippers will make Dadu's day.

653
00:34:59,251 --> 00:35:02,459
Remember when Morn found
Dadu's porn stash?

654
00:35:02,959 --> 00:35:05,292
Yeah, behind the pot!

655
00:35:05,626 --> 00:35:07,501
Tied up in a plastic bag...

656
00:35:08,001 --> 00:35:09,292
He's a crazy dude...

657
00:35:09,417 --> 00:35:11,251
One of those magazines were mine, man...

658
00:35:11,417 --> 00:35:12,042
No.

659
00:35:12,126 --> 00:35:13,001
Barely Legal.

660
00:35:13,084 --> 00:35:14,542
- Barely Legal?!
- Ya.

661
00:35:14,751 --> 00:35:15,959
Oh God...

662
00:35:16,501 --> 00:35:18,126
It was depressing!
My only magazine!

663
00:35:18,209 --> 00:35:19,917
But I managed...

664
00:35:20,876 --> 00:35:21,876
Ah...

665
00:35:22,042 --> 00:35:23,417
Still managing, huh?

666
00:35:23,542 --> 00:35:26,584
Doing really well,
actually... Practice makes perfect...

667
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:29,709
Wait 'til I tell
Morn about your antics...

668
00:35:30,001 --> 00:35:31,167
Look here!

669
00:35:32,167 --> 00:35:33,251
Thanks...

670
00:35:33,709 --> 00:35:34,667
'Barely Perfect'...

671
00:35:34,792 --> 00:35:36,667
- Wait 'til I tell Morn.
- What are you doing, man?

672
00:35:36,751 --> 00:35:38,542
- Nothing, just photoshop.
- Delete it!

673
00:35:38,626 --> 00:35:40,417
- I'm only putting it on instagram!
- Arjun, I was just joking!

674
00:35:40,459 --> 00:35:41,792
Watch it, I'll tweet it...

675
00:35:42,292 --> 00:35:43,251
Arjun, just leave it!

676
00:35:45,084 --> 00:35:46,167
Ninety years...

677
00:35:46,334 --> 00:35:49,376
Ninety... and is this
all Burma Teak wood?

678
00:35:49,501 --> 00:35:50,626
Yeah.

679
00:35:51,751 --> 00:35:52,959
- Hi.
- Hi!

680
00:35:55,417 --> 00:35:57,626
Listen... can I click some pictures?

681
00:35:57,792 --> 00:35:59,709
- Of course.
- Thank you.

682
00:36:00,084 --> 00:36:03,209
Wow, who's that!
I think I'm rushing into this marriage!

683
00:36:03,667 --> 00:36:05,209
So cute, dude!

684
00:36:05,584 --> 00:36:07,042
Hit on him!

685
00:36:09,459 --> 00:36:12,126
- May I have a look inside?
- Sure!

686
00:36:13,126 --> 00:36:14,417
Have you lost it?

687
00:36:14,459 --> 00:36:16,084
- He's so cute, man, I can't help it!
- Tia!

688
00:36:16,167 --> 00:36:17,209
Come with us, Tia...

689
00:36:17,292 --> 00:36:20,292
No, no... You guys go!
It's your pre-Honeymoon period...

690
00:36:20,417 --> 00:36:22,084
What'll I do there?

691
00:36:22,417 --> 00:36:25,542
Okay, but we've decided we're
coming back for your birthday.

692
00:36:25,626 --> 00:36:27,292
Not this birthday thing again.

693
00:36:27,417 --> 00:36:29,334
I honestly want to
spend alone time here.

694
00:36:29,459 --> 00:36:31,876
Plus, I have work - a presentation
to finish and... now I have to go in.

695
00:36:32,042 --> 00:36:33,709
- Yes, sir! Corning.
- Okay, go...

696
00:36:34,001 --> 00:36:36,126
- You have a really nice house, Tia!
- Thank you.

697
00:36:36,417 --> 00:36:38,792
So I'll share the pictures
with my partners and...

698
00:36:38,959 --> 00:36:42,751
Meanwhile, if there's a family elder
I can talk to about business and such...

699
00:36:42,917 --> 00:36:44,167
Please give me the number?

700
00:36:44,917 --> 00:36:46,292
Umm... me.

701
00:36:47,917 --> 00:36:49,917
- Oh, sorry.
- No, that's fine.

702
00:36:50,292 --> 00:36:53,084
When I think of owners,
they're usually old men.

703
00:36:53,167 --> 00:36:55,417
Stomach out, no hair, etc...

704
00:36:55,834 --> 00:37:00,167
Of course! But I look pretty much
the same without my wig and dentures.

705
00:37:02,459 --> 00:37:04,251
How did you find the place, son?

706
00:37:06,667 --> 00:37:08,542
- You're funny.
- You're hot.

707
00:37:12,459 --> 00:37:15,709
I'm really funny!
Sometimes. Funny girl...

708
00:37:15,834 --> 00:37:17,126
Yeah, it was a pleasure.

709
00:37:17,251 --> 00:37:18,792
- Keep in touch.
- You too.

710
00:37:18,959 --> 00:37:20,459
- Okay, bye...
- Bye!

711
00:37:24,751 --> 00:37:27,126
And this was taken in Hawaii.

712
00:37:28,292 --> 00:37:29,584
You know, son...

713
00:37:30,001 --> 00:37:35,334
I used to dream of going to Hawaii...
And roaming naked on the beach...

714
00:37:35,667 --> 00:37:38,584
One chica here and one...

715
00:37:39,417 --> 00:37:42,876
That dream should have
been fulfilled in your youth.

716
00:37:43,042 --> 00:37:48,126
Ignore her. Maybe we should
take you to France for your birthday.

717
00:37:48,209 --> 00:37:49,376
France has the nude beaches.

718
00:37:49,459 --> 00:37:53,251
Take me anywhere...
All I have to do is shave my chest.

719
00:37:53,626 --> 00:37:57,251
I mean, if you want to get
six pack abs, that'll be good too...

720
00:37:57,417 --> 00:37:58,792
Leave this.

721
00:37:59,084 --> 00:38:02,417
Tell me... Can you watch
anything you want on this... iPanda?

722
00:38:02,584 --> 00:38:03,584
Yeah...

723
00:38:03,917 --> 00:38:05,667
- Films, too?
- Yes...

724
00:38:06,834 --> 00:38:08,417
Like... exciting films?

725
00:38:09,626 --> 00:38:11,042
Exciting?

726
00:38:11,751 --> 00:38:14,959
What do they call it... blue films?!

727
00:38:16,834 --> 00:38:17,667
You can...

728
00:38:18,584 --> 00:38:20,792
- How exciting!
- There are cartoon versions now!

729
00:38:20,876 --> 00:38:22,334
- Ohhh!
- Yeah!

730
00:38:22,459 --> 00:38:24,626
It's so easy for your generation.

731
00:38:24,792 --> 00:38:25,792
How so?

732
00:38:25,959 --> 00:38:31,626
I lied to your Grandma and watched
Ram Teri Ganga Maili 14 times!

733
00:38:31,792 --> 00:38:32,584
14!

734
00:38:32,667 --> 00:38:34,042
Just for one scene...

735
00:38:34,167 --> 00:38:37,126
When Mandakini comes in that wet sari...

736
00:38:37,959 --> 00:38:40,751
After that waterfall...

737
00:38:41,209 --> 00:38:43,751
I would dream of standing behind her...

738
00:38:43,834 --> 00:38:46,126
She would embrace me-

739
00:38:46,667 --> 00:38:50,709
I think the bananas are rotten, buddy...

740
00:38:53,292 --> 00:38:55,459
That's what they
call a change of topic!

741
00:38:55,876 --> 00:38:57,334
My arms call out to you...

742
00:38:57,459 --> 00:38:59,459
- I have a lotto learn from you.
Check this out!

743
00:38:59,667 --> 00:39:00,834
Oi!!!

744
00:39:01,501 --> 00:39:03,459
It's her!

745
00:39:06,084 --> 00:39:09,501
Stop me before I
climb into this iPanda!

746
00:39:13,167 --> 00:39:16,501
Arjun... I have an idea.

747
00:39:18,292 --> 00:39:22,042
Are you sure Dadu won't like a
foxy 10x10 photo of your Grandma more?

748
00:39:22,209 --> 00:39:23,876
You know Dadu...

749
00:39:24,376 --> 00:39:26,459
No, dude... your Grandma was quite sexy.

750
00:39:27,084 --> 00:39:29,501
- Not my Grandmom!
- This could break!

751
00:39:29,917 --> 00:39:31,292
Come here for a second!

752
00:39:31,376 --> 00:39:32,459
Bring this inside!

753
00:39:33,251 --> 00:39:34,126
What man...

754
00:39:34,209 --> 00:39:35,417
Look it's ready... Karim!

755
00:39:36,501 --> 00:39:39,376
- Stop staring at Aunty
and bring her in!

756
00:39:48,626 --> 00:39:50,584
- Uncle! White and red small-
- Boo!

757
00:39:50,667 --> 00:39:53,001
Oh my God! Arjun! Hi!

758
00:39:53,459 --> 00:39:54,667
- How are you?
- Good!

759
00:39:54,751 --> 00:39:55,584
Not available.

760
00:39:55,667 --> 00:39:57,876
- Where can I get it?
- No idea, ma'am.

761
00:39:57,959 --> 00:39:58,834
What are you looking for?

762
00:39:58,917 --> 00:40:01,751
You know... We used to eat
those sweet cigarettes as kids?

763
00:40:01,917 --> 00:40:02,542
Oh ya ya...

764
00:40:02,626 --> 00:40:04,667
I can't find them
anywhere and I love them!

765
00:40:04,876 --> 00:40:05,917
- Ah!
- Yeah...

766
00:40:06,792 --> 00:40:07,792
What are you doing here?

767
00:40:08,001 --> 00:40:11,167
I was actually in Wasim's studio...

768
00:40:11,334 --> 00:40:12,459
Want to see?

769
00:40:13,001 --> 00:40:13,876
Okay... what?

770
00:40:13,959 --> 00:40:15,001
- Come I'll show... come!
- Okay!

771
00:40:15,084 --> 00:40:17,001
- Aye! Okay, please pack this!
- Come!

772
00:40:27,126 --> 00:40:28,917
Don't judge,
it's for Dadu's birthday!

773
00:40:29,084 --> 00:40:31,667
Boobly! I know this bodybuilding
competition is important...

774
00:40:31,751 --> 00:40:32,667
I'll get people!

775
00:40:34,459 --> 00:40:35,376
<i>-</i> Hi!
<i>-</i> Hi!

776
00:40:35,459 --> 00:40:36,251
What's up?

777
00:40:36,334 --> 00:40:37,959
Tia... I'm good! How are you?

778
00:40:38,126 --> 00:40:39,792
Stop enjoying this
and take madam inside.

779
00:40:39,917 --> 00:40:41,084
Don't touch her there...

780
00:40:41,167 --> 00:40:43,084
Boobly's called you
for the bodybuilding thing.

781
00:40:43,209 --> 00:40:44,292
Come man, please... it'll be fun.

782
00:40:44,376 --> 00:40:45,501
I have no interest in naked men.

783
00:40:45,584 --> 00:40:49,459
Try and understand, man... Boobly
doesn't have my brains or looks!

784
00:40:49,501 --> 00:40:50,959
- He only knows bodybuilding!
- Let it go, man...

785
00:40:51,042 --> 00:40:52,667
He needs the encouragement...
It'll be fun!

786
00:40:52,876 --> 00:40:53,834
I'll come!

787
00:40:53,959 --> 00:40:55,209
You? Really?

788
00:40:55,292 --> 00:40:56,042
Ya!

789
00:40:56,126 --> 00:40:57,584
- That's nice.
- I'm nice.

790
00:40:57,667 --> 00:40:59,084
Ya... she's nice.

791
00:40:59,334 --> 00:41:02,459
Okay, I guess I'll come too...
Day after, right?

792
00:41:02,667 --> 00:41:04,251
Look at this turncoat.

793
00:41:04,459 --> 00:41:06,251
Team player, bro!
Boobly's like my brother!

794
00:41:06,334 --> 00:41:07,709
Oh, is that right?!

795
00:41:09,084 --> 00:41:11,001
- Day after?
- Day after.

796
00:41:25,501 --> 00:41:28,459
Listen, this is the catering area.
We need 10 tables set up there.

797
00:41:28,542 --> 00:41:29,334
Okay-

798
00:41:29,417 --> 00:41:31,292
- Mehfooz! Up there!
- DJ?

799
00:41:31,376 --> 00:41:32,876
The DJ's ready.
Ready, ready...

800
00:41:32,959 --> 00:41:34,292
- I'm going now.
- Confetti!

801
00:41:34,376 --> 00:41:35,334
Morn!

802
00:41:35,417 --> 00:41:37,792
- Where's the phone diary kept?
- It's right there! Here!

803
00:41:37,876 --> 00:41:38,709
Oh, okay.

804
00:41:39,959 --> 00:41:42,834
I finally spoke to Shashi Uncle... He
said he'll be here as soon as he can.

805
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:43,709
Okay, thank goodness.

806
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:46,751
And also why don't you
call some of your hot friends.

807
00:41:48,209 --> 00:41:50,667
Oh and listen...
Don't tell Shashi Uncle anything.

808
00:41:50,834 --> 00:41:51,667
About what?

809
00:41:51,751 --> 00:41:53,792
All that drama with your Dad...

810
00:41:53,876 --> 00:41:57,334
Hello? This is Rahul calling on behalf
of Mr. Ramesh Chand...

811
00:41:57,417 --> 00:41:58,709
May I speak to Mr. Chaudhry?

812
00:41:59,667 --> 00:42:00,876
What?!

813
00:42:02,917 --> 00:42:04,126
I'm sorry to hear that.

814
00:42:04,626 --> 00:42:05,542
- Bro...

815
00:42:05,959 --> 00:42:08,292
Looks like at this rate only you,
me and Wasim will be at this party.

816
00:42:08,959 --> 00:42:10,751
Ask Dad to call his friends!

817
00:42:11,001 --> 00:42:12,584
Ask your Dad to call his friends!

818
00:42:14,042 --> 00:42:15,209
What's cooking?

819
00:42:15,417 --> 00:42:17,542
Smells really nice!

820
00:42:21,876 --> 00:42:25,001
Morn, I never talk to Shashi
Uncle about such things.

821
00:42:25,667 --> 00:42:29,084
I'm not choosing sides
or saying who's right...

822
00:42:29,417 --> 00:42:31,792
But lately, you're always
picking fights with Dad.

823
00:42:32,459 --> 00:42:33,542
I'm picking fights?!

824
00:42:33,751 --> 00:42:36,501
I'm just telling it as I see it.

825
00:42:36,917 --> 00:42:39,917
You know what my 35th
anniversary gift was?

826
00:42:41,209 --> 00:42:42,292
A Mixer-Grinder...

827
00:42:42,792 --> 00:42:43,959
- From Harsh.

828
00:42:44,501 --> 00:42:47,626
There's no difference between
Dharmendra and me, these days.

829
00:42:47,792 --> 00:42:49,917
- What?!
- It's not like I can be Anu!

830
00:42:50,292 --> 00:42:53,751
Ever since she opened her boutique,
all I hear is -

831
00:42:54,084 --> 00:42:56,792
"Anu's taste", "Anu's business sense"...

832
00:42:56,876 --> 00:42:59,792
Morn, not this Anu spiel again...
Who cares about Anu's taste?!

833
00:42:59,876 --> 00:43:01,876
Can't we all talk about
this like mature adults?!

834
00:43:04,084 --> 00:43:05,542
Maybe not all of us...

835
00:43:06,876 --> 00:43:09,792
Morn, come to London
with me for a few days?

836
00:43:09,917 --> 00:43:10,792
With you?

837
00:43:11,209 --> 00:43:12,376
What would I do there?

838
00:43:12,459 --> 00:43:13,626
We'll party, obviously!

839
00:43:14,959 --> 00:43:17,876
No, no... You're always so busy...

840
00:43:18,001 --> 00:43:19,501
Morn I've lived there for 8 years...

841
00:43:19,584 --> 00:43:22,584
If you don't come,
how will you see how I live...

842
00:43:22,792 --> 00:43:25,792
where I live...and more importantly
with whom I live?

843
00:43:26,001 --> 00:43:27,459
Ah! Point!

844
00:43:27,667 --> 00:43:33,709
But you forget... as your mother,
I know you better than anyone else.

845
00:43:34,501 --> 00:43:38,001
Okay, if you want
to do something for me...

846
00:43:38,334 --> 00:43:43,667
Forget this Nicky person
and get me a nice Indian bride.

847
00:43:44,042 --> 00:43:47,001
- Grandchildren playing on my lap...
- End of conversation!

848
00:43:47,167 --> 00:43:49,834
Look who it is!

849
00:43:50,292 --> 00:43:52,501
I'm ready to have
Rahul's perfect children!

850
00:43:53,084 --> 00:43:54,792
Idiots.

851
00:43:55,001 --> 00:43:56,334
Oh, Rahul... She's perfect!

852
00:43:57,542 --> 00:44:00,167
Look what you've done, Rahul!

853
00:44:01,459 --> 00:44:02,376
Bye!

854
00:44:04,459 --> 00:44:06,042
- I'm here 'til the 12th!

855
00:44:07,459 --> 00:44:10,792
I've called for the documents... They
should be here in a couple of days.

856
00:44:11,959 --> 00:44:14,251
Here we are at the main porch.

857
00:44:15,209 --> 00:44:17,459
Say hello to our helpful broker,
Mr. Makhija.

858
00:44:18,084 --> 00:44:21,459
It's not African, it's an Indian name!

859
00:44:21,751 --> 00:44:26,292
And this, Nick, is the beautiful
owner of this house... Tia.

860
00:44:26,376 --> 00:44:27,417
Say hi.

861
00:44:27,459 --> 00:44:29,709
Hi! Who am I talking to?

862
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:30,709
Be nice.

863
00:44:31,376 --> 00:44:35,292
I'm heading to the garden
to show you the wonderful sunset.

864
00:44:35,542 --> 00:44:37,626
I really can't believe
this place was shut for <i>2</i> years.

865
00:44:38,334 --> 00:44:40,334
If I was you,
I'd come once every <i>2</i> months.

866
00:44:40,417 --> 00:44:42,084
It's only a 2 hour flight from Mumbai!

867
00:44:42,292 --> 00:44:45,376
Yeah... but I'm scared of flying.

868
00:44:45,834 --> 00:44:49,417
So? Everyone's afraid of something...

869
00:44:49,709 --> 00:44:51,126
What are you afraid of?

870
00:44:51,334 --> 00:44:52,459
I'm not telling you.

871
00:44:52,709 --> 00:44:55,001
Why?! Come on...

872
00:44:55,501 --> 00:44:57,334
- It's embarrassing.
- Come on, Rahul...

873
00:44:57,459 --> 00:44:58,626
- Rats...
- What?!

874
00:44:58,709 --> 00:44:59,501
Rats!

875
00:44:59,584 --> 00:45:00,584
Are you serious?!

876
00:45:00,667 --> 00:45:01,501
I'm serious!

877
00:45:02,417 --> 00:45:03,667
Very manly!

878
00:45:04,084 --> 00:45:06,751
There's a Nepalese
film playing at Liberty...

879
00:45:07,001 --> 00:45:09,709
Sorry, Kishore,
I don't know Nepalese...

880
00:45:09,792 --> 00:45:11,584
Tia he isn't asking you out...
I think he's asking for himself.

881
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:15,876
I know! My sense of humour...
Please go!

882
00:45:16,042 --> 00:45:18,376
- Your dinner?
- I'll eat out.

883
00:45:18,709 --> 00:45:20,292
Bye, Kishore...

884
00:45:20,501 --> 00:45:21,584
I love you, Kishore!

885
00:45:21,667 --> 00:45:24,417
Does he always look so scared?
- Always!

886
00:45:25,042 --> 00:45:27,709
Are there any good
restaurants around here?

887
00:45:29,501 --> 00:45:32,042
Maybe Shinchow's?!

888
00:45:41,542 --> 00:45:42,834
Kishore always looks depressed!

889
00:45:42,917 --> 00:45:44,876
He's actually really happy!

890
00:45:45,167 --> 00:45:46,251
By <i>the way...</i>

891
00:45:46,459 --> 00:45:48,459
You're right!
This place is shady as hell!

892
00:45:48,542 --> 00:45:49,834
Warned you...

893
00:45:51,084 --> 00:45:52,209
So spicy!

894
00:45:53,959 --> 00:45:55,626
Something's stuck in your teeth...

895
00:45:57,209 --> 00:45:58,251
Sorry...

896
00:45:58,459 --> 00:45:59,834
More beer?

897
00:46:00,209 --> 00:46:01,834
2 more beers, please!

898
00:46:02,626 --> 00:46:03,667
Oh!

899
00:46:04,459 --> 00:46:06,792
There's something
coming out of your nose...

900
00:46:07,167 --> 00:46:08,084
Sorry...

901
00:46:10,876 --> 00:46:12,042
Now?

902
00:46:16,042 --> 00:46:17,417
<i>I</i> got you!

903
00:46:17,876 --> 00:46:20,501
Okay... what's more embarrassing...

904
00:46:20,792 --> 00:46:24,167
Chicken stuck in your teeth
or a booger coming out of your nose?

905
00:46:24,459 --> 00:46:26,001
A booger stuck in my teeth!

906
00:46:26,251 --> 00:46:27,084
What?!

907
00:46:27,251 --> 00:46:28,417
Can that even happen?!

908
00:46:28,459 --> 00:46:29,917
Didn't you do this as a kid?

909
00:46:30,876 --> 00:46:32,376
Yuck! Rahul!

910
00:46:32,459 --> 00:46:34,584
- I used to love it, man!

911
00:46:34,834 --> 00:46:35,917
That's sick!

912
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:36,876
Thank you!

913
00:46:42,459 --> 00:46:44,001
No way Tia...
There's a limit to being crazy...

914
00:46:44,084 --> 00:46:44,917
There is no such limit!

915
00:46:45,001 --> 00:46:46,584
There is! You can't do it, anyway...

916
00:46:46,667 --> 00:46:49,584
If I do this,
we are going to the dance floor.

917
00:46:49,751 --> 00:46:51,417
- Done.
- Okay.

918
00:47:06,251 --> 00:47:07,542
Shit! Sorry!

919
00:47:08,834 --> 00:47:09,876
Sir!

920
00:47:10,292 --> 00:47:13,417
It was a mosquito! You'll get dengue!

921
00:47:13,542 --> 00:47:14,959
What mosquito?

922
00:47:15,501 --> 00:47:17,459
I also got bitten...

923
00:47:17,876 --> 00:47:19,084
Sir!

924
00:47:30,084 --> 00:47:31,042
Show me your moves!

925
00:47:31,292 --> 00:47:32,334
What moves?

926
00:47:33,042 --> 00:47:34,417
Everyone's got moves!

927
00:47:34,584 --> 00:47:35,459
Such as?

928
00:47:35,834 --> 00:47:37,042
Such as...

929
00:47:37,209 --> 00:47:39,209
The Shampoo Ad move!

930
00:47:39,292 --> 00:47:40,209
Okay-

931
00:47:42,959 --> 00:47:44,251
Come on!

932
00:47:49,042 --> 00:47:49,959
Your turn.

933
00:47:50,042 --> 00:47:52,334
Okay... The Milkshake!

934
00:47:53,834 --> 00:47:54,626
Okay...

935
00:47:57,959 --> 00:48:00,334
Oh God! Superb!

936
00:48:00,709 --> 00:48:01,959
This is my favourite!

937
00:48:02,334 --> 00:48:04,001
Grinding spices move!

938
00:48:04,084 --> 00:48:05,376
Alright! Okay.

939
00:48:06,542 --> 00:48:08,792
Grinding spices!

940
00:48:12,001 --> 00:48:13,251
The Iron move!

941
00:48:17,251 --> 00:48:18,126
Pigeon!

942
00:48:23,209 --> 00:48:24,542
Electrocution!

943
00:48:33,917 --> 00:48:35,209
Okay... bye...

944
00:48:35,417 --> 00:48:36,334
Bye...

945
00:48:36,626 --> 00:48:37,917
See you.

946
00:48:38,459 --> 00:48:39,876
- Let's go.
- Oh shit...

947
00:48:39,959 --> 00:48:40,792
What's wrong?

948
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:43,834
- Kishore!
The fuse is out again!

949
00:48:44,209 --> 00:48:47,334
Tell me if there are any more issues
with this house... I'll call Makhija.

950
00:48:47,417 --> 00:48:49,334
- Rat!!!
- What the f-

951
00:48:54,959 --> 00:48:57,126
Are you nuts?!

952
00:48:59,292 --> 00:49:00,751
This might work...

953
00:49:06,251 --> 00:49:07,417
Or not.

954
00:49:08,876 --> 00:49:10,417
It's a little small, isn't it?

955
00:49:14,667 --> 00:49:15,792
What?

956
00:49:17,709 --> 00:49:19,084
What is it?

957
00:49:20,334 --> 00:49:22,209
- Dude...
- Tia, you're sick.

958
00:49:24,417 --> 00:49:25,376
What are you saying?

959
00:49:25,459 --> 00:49:28,459
You're leaving?! My fuse... oh.

960
00:49:29,334 --> 00:49:32,417
Sorry!
It was a joke!

961
00:49:32,917 --> 00:49:35,042
Kishore, man!!!

962
00:49:38,001 --> 00:49:40,209
Bang it right in the centre...

963
00:49:42,501 --> 00:49:43,584
You hold this.

964
00:49:44,167 --> 00:49:45,876
I'll lift you up.

965
00:49:46,126 --> 00:49:47,501
Are you sure?

966
00:49:48,459 --> 00:49:50,459
Okay, one second... One second!

967
00:49:50,667 --> 00:49:51,834
Okay, ready.

968
00:49:53,251 --> 00:49:54,292
Okay, ready.

969
00:49:56,001 --> 00:49:57,876
You're really heavy, man!

970
00:49:57,959 --> 00:49:59,959
- Shut up! I have heavy bones!

971
00:50:00,042 --> 00:50:01,209
- Oh God!

972
00:50:01,626 --> 00:50:02,709
- Oh God!

973
00:50:04,876 --> 00:50:06,042
Sorry...

974
00:50:06,542 --> 00:50:08,917
Let me see?

975
00:50:09,459 --> 00:50:11,251
I think it's a scratch or-

976
00:50:12,917 --> 00:50:14,834
A little bit here...

977
00:50:16,084 --> 00:50:17,334
Right there...

978
00:50:17,584 --> 00:50:18,709
Is it hurting?

979
00:50:22,876 --> 00:50:24,167
- Ma'am?!

980
00:50:24,501 --> 00:50:25,792
Kishore!

981
00:50:26,459 --> 00:50:27,334
Where are you?

982
00:50:27,417 --> 00:50:29,042
Kishore, where were you?!

983
00:50:29,126 --> 00:50:31,417
I was watching the movie!

984
00:50:31,501 --> 00:50:33,126
Why didn't you fix this?

985
00:50:33,292 --> 00:50:36,459
That's for the pump room!
The fuse is here.

986
00:50:37,417 --> 00:50:40,167
Why is it there? You didn't fix it...

987
00:50:41,376 --> 00:50:42,751
Thank God...

988
00:50:47,417 --> 00:50:48,751
I'll leave... It's late.

989
00:50:48,876 --> 00:50:49,667
- Yeah...

990
00:50:50,167 --> 00:50:52,209
<i>-</i> Okay...
<i>-</i> Okay!

991
00:50:52,792 --> 00:50:54,042
- Bye...
- Bye.

992
00:51:00,084 --> 00:51:01,209
Bunkoo...

993
00:51:02,709 --> 00:51:04,042
I'm so-

994
00:51:04,459 --> 00:51:06,459
Please go, Kishore. Thank you.

995
00:51:07,834 --> 00:51:10,584
Shit, Bunkoo... Shit shit shit...

996
00:51:10,792 --> 00:51:12,334
I'm so stupid!

997
00:51:12,459 --> 00:51:14,584
Shit, I'm so stupid!

998
00:51:16,626 --> 00:51:18,459
This is all your fault!

999
00:51:19,626 --> 00:51:20,792
Hey...

1000
00:51:21,501 --> 00:51:23,417
...you think he won't
want my house now?

1001
00:51:23,667 --> 00:51:26,501
- Listen, let's discuss
this over Skype on Thursday...

1002
00:51:26,959 --> 00:51:29,501
I can't right now!
I've got too much on my plate!

1003
00:51:29,626 --> 00:51:31,626
I'm at the hospital,
I'll call you later.

1004
00:51:32,334 --> 00:51:33,167
Bye.

1005
00:51:33,542 --> 00:51:35,042
What's wrong? Problem?

1006
00:51:36,376 --> 00:51:38,376
I'm never gonna finish this damn book!

1007
00:51:40,792 --> 00:51:42,126
Harsh isn't here?

1008
00:51:42,834 --> 00:51:43,709
No, Why?

1009
00:51:44,709 --> 00:51:46,876
He said he'd come with you...

1010
00:51:48,709 --> 00:51:50,001
Now he's using you as an excuse.

1011
00:51:50,084 --> 00:51:50,959
Morn!

1012
00:51:51,501 --> 00:51:53,876
Don't be so suspicious all the time...

1013
00:51:54,584 --> 00:51:56,167
I'm going to Dadu.

1014
00:51:57,459 --> 00:51:58,709
Woah...

1015
00:52:00,501 --> 00:52:02,834
How can they be so huge?!

1016
00:52:03,084 --> 00:52:05,251
You have no idea how
big they can be, Dadu!

1017
00:52:05,459 --> 00:52:08,084
I love this so much...

1018
00:52:08,376 --> 00:52:09,959
It stopped!

1019
00:52:10,209 --> 00:52:12,459
You need a credit card to watch more...

1020
00:52:12,751 --> 00:52:13,834
Give me yours!

1021
00:52:13,917 --> 00:52:15,459
Mine... actually...

1022
00:52:16,126 --> 00:52:19,417
Rahul! You have a credit card, right?

1023
00:52:19,501 --> 00:52:20,667
Ya, Why?

1024
00:52:20,959 --> 00:52:25,417
I... I... want to download
some hymns!

1025
00:52:25,959 --> 00:52:27,792
- Yeah, Wasim!
- Turning to religion, Dadu?

1026
00:52:28,001 --> 00:52:30,709
Ever since my heart attack
it's the only thing that keeps happy.

1027
00:52:30,792 --> 00:52:32,251
<i>-</i> Really?
<i>-</i> Yes!

1028
00:52:32,626 --> 00:52:34,292
Dadu, I'm off.

1029
00:52:34,501 --> 00:52:35,376
What's your hurry?

1030
00:52:35,459 --> 00:52:39,042
I'm going to see Boobly's big ones...
It's free... Wanna come?

1031
00:52:39,126 --> 00:52:40,626
No, no, I have my hymns.

1032
00:52:40,751 --> 00:52:42,542
- Okay, bye...
- Bye!

1033
00:52:42,751 --> 00:52:44,834
Oi! spiritual card.

1034
00:52:49,626 --> 00:52:51,501
He's so sexy.

1035
00:52:52,709 --> 00:52:55,459
Boobly! This girl thinks you're sexy!

1036
00:52:55,792 --> 00:52:57,126
Thanks for coming.

1037
00:53:00,209 --> 00:53:01,167
Very welcome.

1038
00:53:07,209 --> 00:53:08,626
This is mad!

1039
00:53:09,792 --> 00:53:12,459
How can I be enjoying this?!
What's wrong with me!

1040
00:53:14,584 --> 00:53:18,292
Look at Mr. Red Briefs...
Such a long nose!

1041
00:53:18,376 --> 00:53:20,626
I can't believe THAT'S
what you noticed!

1042
00:53:20,751 --> 00:53:21,667
I mean...

1043
00:53:22,459 --> 00:53:23,792
You know what they say...

1044
00:53:23,876 --> 00:53:25,626
A long nose means a long...

1045
00:53:25,709 --> 00:53:26,709
Ah...

1046
00:53:29,459 --> 00:53:31,542
Your nose is pretty tiny.

1047
00:53:34,542 --> 00:53:36,834
It's Boobly!

1048
00:53:42,334 --> 00:53:43,709
Oh my God!

1049
00:53:55,126 --> 00:53:57,126
This was my favourite pose!

1050
00:53:57,376 --> 00:54:02,126
Oh, wow... butt in, chest out!
Wow! Too hot!

1051
00:54:02,959 --> 00:54:06,584
One second... God, why is
my brother always calling me!

1052
00:54:07,709 --> 00:54:08,626
Hello?

1053
00:54:08,709 --> 00:54:09,751
Yeah...

1054
00:54:10,584 --> 00:54:13,167
Yes, I'll take morn tomorrow morning...

1055
00:54:13,626 --> 00:54:15,834
Ya, don't worry... I'll be there.

1056
00:54:16,542 --> 00:54:19,334
See you in a bit. I'll call you... bye.

1057
00:54:21,626 --> 00:54:23,584
So Beavis and Butthead patched up!

1058
00:54:24,084 --> 00:54:27,001
Yeah... Beavis and Butthead
patched up for now.

1059
00:54:27,709 --> 00:54:30,542
- Have you got siblings?
- Nope. One and only!

1060
00:54:30,751 --> 00:54:33,209
Wow! You're so lucky...

1061
00:54:33,542 --> 00:54:35,334
You must've been such a pampered kid.

1062
00:54:35,459 --> 00:54:38,084
I mean, my sweetie pie, my princess...

1063
00:54:38,292 --> 00:54:39,626
That never happened to me.

1064
00:54:41,209 --> 00:54:44,084
You want to be called
'princess' and 'sweetie pie'?

1065
00:54:44,167 --> 00:54:47,584
No, man... I didn't get
much attention growing up...

1066
00:54:48,542 --> 00:54:51,959
My parents died when I was 13.
So I know what you mean.

1067
00:54:52,042 --> 00:54:54,334
Oh... I'm sorry... I didn't mean-

1068
00:54:54,501 --> 00:54:56,501
No, it's okay!
It's not like you knew...

1069
00:54:57,334 --> 00:54:58,542
It's okay.

1070
00:55:01,501 --> 00:55:02,626
I have an offer for you.

1071
00:55:02,917 --> 00:55:04,792
Take my family and
give me your bungalow?

1072
00:55:04,917 --> 00:55:07,667
Oh, really! I'll think about it...

1073
00:55:07,751 --> 00:55:10,292
- Princess!
- Oh ya, of course!

1074
00:55:15,209 --> 00:55:16,667
- Here you go.

1075
00:55:16,876 --> 00:55:19,167
- Some music?
- Ya! Nice pictures...

1076
00:55:19,334 --> 00:55:20,459
Thank you...

1077
00:55:23,792 --> 00:55:25,542
- Listen I don't mean
to be inappropriate...

1078
00:55:25,626 --> 00:55:27,084
- but isn't this too big for you?

1079
00:55:27,167 --> 00:55:29,376
- Arjun!
- What is this, 48 G?!

1080
00:55:29,459 --> 00:55:31,751
Pervert! It's Bunkoo's!

1081
00:55:31,834 --> 00:55:34,542
- Let's meet Bunkoo again, man.
- You're sick! You know that, right?

1082
00:55:34,792 --> 00:55:36,209
- Sick!
- Jealous?

1083
00:55:36,709 --> 00:55:40,209
Of course... that's why
I sent her far, far away.

1084
00:55:40,792 --> 00:55:43,667
Man... someone sedate my brother.

1085
00:55:44,292 --> 00:55:47,667
- Why do you fight with him so much?
- Why do you ask so many questions?

1086
00:55:47,709 --> 00:55:49,501
That's how you make friends!

1087
00:55:51,209 --> 00:55:53,084
- And you don't give up, huh?
- No!

1088
00:55:53,417 --> 00:55:54,751
I don't give up.

1089
00:55:55,876 --> 00:55:57,751
Come on, you can tell me.

1090
00:56:03,834 --> 00:56:08,334
So... 5 years ago,
I was writing my first novel.

1091
00:56:08,792 --> 00:56:13,292
My brother's first book had failed...
and he was struggling with his second.

1092
00:56:15,292 --> 00:56:18,542
When his second book was published,
a year later...

1093
00:56:18,917 --> 00:56:22,251
it was a bestseller... did really well...

1094
00:56:25,251 --> 00:56:31,459
The only problem was that...
his idea was exactly like mine...

1095
00:56:34,042 --> 00:56:35,001
No...

1096
00:56:35,084 --> 00:56:37,709
Of course the writing style
was different... different ending...

1097
00:56:37,792 --> 00:56:42,292
But... subplots,
characters... very similar.

1098
00:56:45,417 --> 00:56:47,084
Didn't you ever confront him about it?

1099
00:56:48,292 --> 00:56:51,959
No... everyone would have said
I'm jealous of his success, as always.

1100
00:56:52,209 --> 00:56:57,042
Besides... Morn said this
could destroy our family... so...

1101
00:56:58,709 --> 00:56:59,834
Maybe...

1102
00:57:02,917 --> 00:57:06,542
Just think... if my name
had been on that book...

1103
00:57:07,834 --> 00:57:10,209
...today publishers
would be chasing me...

1104
00:57:10,292 --> 00:57:13,751
And my parents wouldn't
think I'm such a big loser.

1105
00:57:18,709 --> 00:57:23,667
I have something to cheer you up.

1106
00:57:24,626 --> 00:57:26,834
First close your eyes... come on.

1107
00:57:28,167 --> 00:57:31,626
- What are your intentions?
- Just wait.

1108
00:57:35,001 --> 00:57:36,292
Hold on...

1109
00:57:36,876 --> 00:57:38,417
Okay...

1110
00:57:40,417 --> 00:57:42,792
Actually you're right...
I do feel better!

1111
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:45,334
- See!
- Thanks! I'll take it home.

1112
00:57:45,501 --> 00:57:46,876
Give it back!

1113
00:57:47,209 --> 00:57:48,959
It's not your size.

1114
00:57:49,834 --> 00:57:51,792
Free tomorrow evening?

1115
00:57:52,751 --> 00:57:53,959
Why?

1116
00:57:56,001 --> 00:57:57,959
Arjun Kapoor's suitcase.

1117
00:58:00,042 --> 00:58:01,459
The lock's broken!

1118
00:58:01,709 --> 00:58:03,751
Morn! Where's Arjun?

1119
00:58:03,917 --> 00:58:05,917
- He went to pick up Wasim!

1120
00:58:09,292 --> 00:58:12,209
You can talk to the airline
if there's a problem...

1121
00:58:12,917 --> 00:58:14,501
- Hello...

1122
00:58:14,626 --> 00:58:16,251
Nice to see you...

1123
00:58:16,459 --> 00:58:18,501
Welcome!
- We are the first ones!

1124
00:58:18,751 --> 00:58:21,126
- Smile!
- Cheese!

1125
00:58:23,334 --> 00:58:26,626
- Thank you!
- Thank you, uncle... take care!

1126
00:58:26,876 --> 00:58:28,667
- Who's an uncle?!
- Thank you...

1127
00:58:28,834 --> 00:58:30,959
Who taught you all this?!
The ward boy?

1128
00:58:31,042 --> 00:58:34,709
No one! I invented the selfie myself!

1129
00:58:34,917 --> 00:58:35,959
You and your stories...

1130
00:58:36,042 --> 00:58:37,584
What stories?!

1131
00:58:43,917 --> 00:58:45,501
Wow, she's hot!

1132
00:58:45,626 --> 00:58:47,792
She was my flatmate last year.

1133
00:58:48,417 --> 00:58:50,209
- You live with a chick?
- Ya!

1134
00:58:50,417 --> 00:58:52,292
I live with Boobly.

1135
00:58:52,584 --> 00:58:54,959
Can I borrow Rahul for a minute?

1136
00:58:55,084 --> 00:58:56,917
- Come with me...
- Excuse me.

1137
00:58:57,376 --> 00:58:59,209
- There's someone I want you to meet...
- Who?

1138
00:58:59,292 --> 00:59:00,334
Just come!

1139
00:59:00,417 --> 00:59:01,501
- Morn.

1140
00:59:02,334 --> 00:59:03,751
- I'll hang myself if...
- Preet!

1141
00:59:03,834 --> 00:59:06,959
Hi! I want you to meet my son, Rahul.

1142
00:59:07,042 --> 00:59:07,834
Hi...

1143
00:59:07,917 --> 00:59:10,834
Preet's family owns
the King's Craig estate now.

1144
00:59:11,001 --> 00:59:12,292
<i>-</i> Really!
<i>-</i> Yes!

1145
00:59:12,376 --> 00:59:13,501
Hi, Preet... I'm Rahul.

1146
00:59:13,584 --> 00:59:15,251
Look at those kids!
Excuse me.

1147
00:59:15,792 --> 00:59:17,251
What the hell are you doing?!

1148
00:59:18,417 --> 00:59:20,001
I like your shoes!

1149
00:59:20,459 --> 00:59:22,251
Orange is my favourite colour!

1150
00:59:22,501 --> 00:59:23,626
Is it?!

1151
00:59:24,126 --> 00:59:26,126
- They're actually tangerine.
- Oh.

1152
00:59:27,001 --> 00:59:28,084
Nice...

1153
00:59:29,042 --> 00:59:31,209
So... what do you do?

1154
00:59:31,292 --> 00:59:33,626
I work for a tea company.

1155
00:59:33,876 --> 00:59:34,626
Boobly!

1156
00:59:34,709 --> 00:59:36,376
- Hi, what's up?
- How are you?

1157
00:59:36,542 --> 00:59:37,834
Thanks for coming.

1158
00:59:40,376 --> 00:59:41,209
You're welcome!

1159
00:59:41,292 --> 00:59:42,376
- Hey!

1160
00:59:42,876 --> 00:59:44,042
Hi, Arjun!

1161
00:59:45,042 --> 00:59:46,084
Hey, hi!

1162
00:59:46,167 --> 00:59:48,209
- What's up?

1163
00:59:48,459 --> 00:59:50,751
We have organic green teas...

1164
00:59:50,834 --> 00:59:55,251
Black teas, white teas,
silver tips... and Oolong!

1165
00:59:55,334 --> 00:59:56,751
Have you tried it?

1166
00:59:57,042 --> 00:59:59,251
No, I'm an alcoholic...
so just alcohol for me.

1167
00:59:59,376 --> 01:00:00,292
I'm just kidding.

1168
01:00:00,376 --> 01:00:02,501
I'll go get myself a beer. Want one?

1169
01:00:02,584 --> 01:00:03,292
No...

1170
01:00:03,376 --> 01:00:04,376
- Be right back.
- Okay!

1171
01:00:04,459 --> 01:00:05,959
Wow! Thank you!

1172
01:00:06,042 --> 01:00:07,792
- Did you do all of this?
- Yes!

1173
01:00:08,042 --> 01:00:11,001
If not a writer,
then at least a balloon man.

1174
01:00:11,126 --> 01:00:12,542
- Shut up!
- Save me, man.

1175
01:00:12,626 --> 01:00:14,459
Mom's stuck me with some tea lady!

1176
01:00:14,542 --> 01:00:16,001
Woah, let me see!

1177
01:00:16,709 --> 01:00:17,501
Hi!

1178
01:00:17,584 --> 01:00:18,667
Hi...

1179
01:00:18,751 --> 01:00:19,834
What are you doing here?

1180
01:00:19,917 --> 01:00:21,501
I'm here for his Dadu's birthday!

1181
01:00:21,584 --> 01:00:22,709
How do you know her?

1182
01:00:22,834 --> 01:00:24,584
We're friends... Wait.

1183
01:00:24,834 --> 01:00:26,376
How do you know each other?

1184
01:00:27,251 --> 01:00:30,126
I'm thinking of leasing her house
for the Artist Retreat.

1185
01:00:30,209 --> 01:00:31,251
My house!

1186
01:00:31,542 --> 01:00:32,292
Oh!

1187
01:00:33,501 --> 01:00:34,334
Okay-

1188
01:00:34,501 --> 01:00:36,167
I didn't know you'll were friends!

1189
01:00:36,376 --> 01:00:38,001
He's my older brother.

1190
01:00:38,251 --> 01:00:39,292
Butthead?!

1191
01:00:39,376 --> 01:00:40,959
- Rahul!

1192
01:00:41,584 --> 01:00:44,459
- Same thing.
- Yeah... no... never mind.

1193
01:00:44,751 --> 01:00:47,126
- Small world!
- Yeah, small world, after all...

1194
01:00:47,667 --> 01:00:48,667
Really...

1195
01:00:50,709 --> 01:00:52,667
- Will you have something?
- Of course!

1196
01:00:53,001 --> 01:00:54,209
I don't mind a drink...

1197
01:00:54,292 --> 01:00:55,626
- Beer?
- Ya... sure.

1198
01:00:55,709 --> 01:00:58,126
- What about you?
- No... thanks.

1199
01:01:03,251 --> 01:01:05,876
Listen, I'm really
sorry about the other day...

1200
01:01:06,001 --> 01:01:08,042
- It's okay...
- I'm really embarrassed.

1201
01:01:08,209 --> 01:01:09,376
Apology balloons?

1202
01:01:09,459 --> 01:01:11,667
Yes! For you! Please!

1203
01:01:11,792 --> 01:01:14,042
Thanks... It's okay,
I was pretty drunk, too.

1204
01:01:14,209 --> 01:01:17,626
Yeah! I think they put
something in those memos.

1205
01:01:17,709 --> 01:01:18,584
Food?

1206
01:01:18,667 --> 01:01:20,334
Nah, my stomach's off...

1207
01:01:22,584 --> 01:01:24,126
Something's burning...

1208
01:01:24,417 --> 01:01:25,917
Careful, Dharmendra!

1209
01:01:26,876 --> 01:01:28,251
It's your butt, buddy!

1210
01:01:28,959 --> 01:01:30,042
Hemorrhoids!

1211
01:01:30,417 --> 01:01:31,626
Dadu's here...

1212
01:01:32,626 --> 01:01:33,876
Uncle, Dadu's here.

1213
01:01:34,084 --> 01:01:35,292
Guys, Dadu's here.

1214
01:01:35,376 --> 01:01:38,084
- Is the gift ready?
- Yeah, I'll get it.

1215
01:01:38,876 --> 01:01:40,626
Guys! Dadu's here... come!

1216
01:01:40,709 --> 01:01:42,001
Wasim!

1217
01:04:05,042 --> 01:04:07,167
Hurry up, old man...

1218
01:04:08,709 --> 01:04:11,417
Dadu, this is my friend...Tia.

1219
01:04:11,501 --> 01:04:13,542
- Happy birthday, Dadu!
- Thank you...

1220
01:04:13,626 --> 01:04:16,667
I have a confession.. You're so cute,
I can't take my eyes off you.

1221
01:04:16,751 --> 01:04:18,376
Really...

1222
01:04:18,709 --> 01:04:20,417
She's hitting on me...

1223
01:04:21,334 --> 01:04:23,001
Girls today, I tell you...

1224
01:04:23,084 --> 01:04:25,459
Will you go on a
date to Hawaii with me?

1225
01:04:25,542 --> 01:04:26,751
Hawaii?! Of course!

1226
01:04:26,917 --> 01:04:28,959
Come on, play your turn!

1227
01:04:29,042 --> 01:04:31,667
Alright, fine...

1228
01:04:32,417 --> 01:04:33,584
Look!

1229
01:04:34,792 --> 01:04:37,501
Wow, Dadu! Great hand!

1230
01:04:38,417 --> 01:04:39,792
Sorry, we pack.

1231
01:04:40,376 --> 01:04:41,417
Pack!

1232
01:04:42,876 --> 01:04:43,959
Damnit

1233
01:04:44,042 --> 01:04:45,334
I'm so sorry!

1234
01:04:45,459 --> 01:04:46,917
So then, I win...

1235
01:04:47,084 --> 01:04:50,042
You come here! You're my lucky charm!

1236
01:04:50,126 --> 01:04:52,001
Dharmu! Get her a chair!

1237
01:04:52,084 --> 01:04:53,834
- Come sit!
- Okay...

1238
01:04:53,917 --> 01:04:56,084
Arjun, you come here.
You're my lucky charm!

1239
01:04:56,167 --> 01:04:59,001
Yes, Mr. Choksi... I'll
just go to the loo and come.

1240
01:04:59,084 --> 01:05:00,292
Okay!

1241
01:05:00,792 --> 01:05:01,876
Come on!

1242
01:05:02,042 --> 01:05:04,209
Arjun... Did you invite her?

1243
01:05:04,292 --> 01:05:05,167
Who her?

1244
01:05:05,251 --> 01:05:07,001
Anu Aunty, man!

1245
01:05:07,417 --> 01:05:09,001
He's always drunk!

1246
01:05:10,251 --> 01:05:11,501
I didn't invite her...

1247
01:05:11,584 --> 01:05:13,542
Lowest card wins!

1248
01:05:21,084 --> 01:05:22,917
Dad the party's screwed now!

1249
01:05:23,376 --> 01:05:26,459
I called all my old bank colleagues!

1250
01:05:26,542 --> 01:05:28,376
It would be strange to not call her!

1251
01:05:28,501 --> 01:05:30,501
And you know when Dadu was sick...

1252
01:05:30,626 --> 01:05:32,626
- Can you'll please taste this soup?

1253
01:05:32,959 --> 01:05:34,292
Is the salt okay?

1254
01:05:35,209 --> 01:05:38,001
- Something wrong?
- No, no... nothing.

1255
01:05:39,167 --> 01:05:40,417
Needs more salt...

1256
01:05:40,584 --> 01:05:42,084
Okay, why are you making such a face?!

1257
01:05:42,251 --> 01:05:44,209
I just have to use the loo...

1258
01:05:44,334 --> 01:05:45,334
So go!

1259
01:05:45,417 --> 01:05:46,917
Taste it, please?

1260
01:05:48,584 --> 01:05:50,667
- Hello! How are you?
- Hi, Anu Aunty!

1261
01:05:50,751 --> 01:05:52,709
- Just needs a little salt, Morn...

1262
01:05:52,792 --> 01:05:53,709
Ummm... Hi!

1263
01:05:54,542 --> 01:05:56,209
Dadu's outside, let's go meet him?

1264
01:05:56,292 --> 01:05:58,251
I thought I'll meet you first.

1265
01:05:58,334 --> 01:05:59,459
Really...

1266
01:06:00,084 --> 01:06:01,751
- Hello!
- Hi, Anu Aunty...

1267
01:06:01,876 --> 01:06:04,626
- Hi, Harsh!
- Hi... Hi, Anu...

1268
01:06:05,251 --> 01:06:07,292
Here! Your favourite caramel cookies!

1269
01:06:07,376 --> 01:06:08,584
Oh ya! Thank you!

1270
01:06:08,667 --> 01:06:11,084
When you were a kid you
used to always come to me...

1271
01:06:11,167 --> 01:06:13,376
and ask me for "just one more"!

1272
01:06:13,584 --> 01:06:14,876
Really!

1273
01:06:15,876 --> 01:06:18,042
- I'm so happy to
see you after so long.

1274
01:06:18,209 --> 01:06:19,959
Look at you now! Handsome!

1275
01:06:20,001 --> 01:06:22,167
- Who invited her?

1276
01:06:22,417 --> 01:06:23,959
Dadu's right there...

1277
01:06:24,084 --> 01:06:25,376
- Hi, Sunita!

1278
01:06:25,751 --> 01:06:26,834
You look nice!

1279
01:06:26,917 --> 01:06:27,667
I need some ice...

1280
01:06:27,751 --> 01:06:29,876
- I'll get it!
- Get her out of my house.

1281
01:06:30,334 --> 01:06:32,334
- Please, Harsh!
- She's a guest...

1282
01:06:32,501 --> 01:06:34,167
- Guest, my bloody foot!
- Morn, please...

1283
01:06:34,251 --> 01:06:36,251
- Sunita...
- Anu, one sec.

1284
01:06:36,417 --> 01:06:39,834
I raise you 10!

1285
01:06:41,542 --> 01:06:42,751
Aye!

1286
01:06:42,834 --> 01:06:44,042
- This is cheating!

1287
01:06:44,542 --> 01:06:46,667
Like I would cheat on my birthday!

1288
01:06:46,917 --> 01:06:50,876
Please! You're so old now,
you're relying on a child for help!

1289
01:06:50,959 --> 01:06:52,667
One second!
Choksi uncle!

1290
01:06:52,751 --> 01:06:54,584
I'm taking my 30 bucks back.

1291
01:06:54,792 --> 01:06:57,251
Calm down, everybody!

1292
01:06:57,459 --> 01:06:59,001
One second, everybody!

1293
01:06:59,209 --> 01:07:02,001
- I'm really sorry...
- I don't want to upset anybody...

1294
01:07:02,209 --> 01:07:04,209
I'm sorry... I shouldn't have come.

1295
01:07:04,542 --> 01:07:06,126
I'm so sorry... Come with me.

1296
01:07:06,292 --> 01:07:07,376
Anu...

1297
01:07:08,834 --> 01:07:10,126
What's he saying sorry for?!

1298
01:07:10,292 --> 01:07:12,626
Are you done? Happy now?

1299
01:07:12,751 --> 01:07:13,959
Is this how we treat friends?!

1300
01:07:14,167 --> 01:07:15,876
Stuffing your face with
cake has made you so fat!

1301
01:07:16,042 --> 01:07:17,792
- How dare you call me fat!

1302
01:07:17,959 --> 01:07:20,209
I hope you fall in a ditch!

1303
01:07:20,417 --> 01:07:21,751
Come here, Boobly!

1304
01:07:23,751 --> 01:07:24,917
Do something!

1305
01:07:25,126 --> 01:07:28,292
You come to my house
and call me a cheat!

1306
01:07:28,501 --> 01:07:30,001
How many such friends do you have?

1307
01:07:30,167 --> 01:07:31,667
Just tell me all at once.

1308
01:07:31,792 --> 01:07:33,709
You're a lunatic.
You belong in an asylum.

1309
01:07:33,792 --> 01:07:35,167
- Dad...
- Good plan!

1310
01:07:35,251 --> 01:07:36,667
Just get me out of the way!

1311
01:07:36,751 --> 01:07:38,251
I'm going to break this goddamn thing!

1312
01:07:38,334 --> 01:07:39,834
<i>-</i> Dad!

1313
01:07:40,126 --> 01:07:41,834
I'll give you a slap!

1314
01:07:42,376 --> 01:07:44,709
Boobly, are you mad?!
Put Uncle down!

1315
01:07:45,084 --> 01:07:47,709
- Don't put him down!

1316
01:07:48,626 --> 01:07:50,251
- Dad!
- Ma, please!

1317
01:07:50,834 --> 01:07:53,167
- I'd like to see what you can do!
- Dad, calm down!

1318
01:07:54,792 --> 01:07:58,334
- Put him down!
- Is he nuts?!

1319
01:07:59,292 --> 01:08:00,959
Put him down, you bloody lunatic!

1320
01:08:01,167 --> 01:08:03,209
<i>'</i> Dad!

1321
01:08:03,376 --> 01:08:06,084
I'll break your limbs
if you do that again!

1322
01:08:06,167 --> 01:08:07,959
How dare he bring her here!

1323
01:08:08,209 --> 01:08:10,001
How dare Harsh do that!

1324
01:08:10,251 --> 01:08:11,501
Yeah, Ma...

1325
01:08:11,584 --> 01:08:14,709
- He humiliated in front of the world!
- Morn, you're absolutely right...

1326
01:08:14,876 --> 01:08:17,209
I still have to go to the loo.
Just wait here <i>2</i> seconds...

1327
01:08:17,292 --> 01:08:19,334
Please don't move!

1328
01:08:24,792 --> 01:08:27,334
- Choksi Uncle, I apologise...

1329
01:08:27,501 --> 01:08:29,042
Uncle, wait...

1330
01:08:29,209 --> 01:08:31,376
Look here, donkey!

1331
01:08:32,501 --> 01:08:34,126
Cookies, it seems...

1332
01:08:34,376 --> 01:08:36,417
- Dadu...
- Fogie, look here!

1333
01:08:38,001 --> 01:08:39,126
- Dadu, stop!

1334
01:08:39,209 --> 01:08:41,417
She forgot her goddamn cookies!

1335
01:08:52,001 --> 01:08:53,667
What a great party, huh?

1336
01:08:54,584 --> 01:08:56,126
Having fun?

1337
01:08:57,334 --> 01:09:00,251
It's over! Go home!

1338
01:09:03,001 --> 01:09:04,792
I'm serious! Go home!

1339
01:09:22,084 --> 01:09:23,792
Where were you?

1340
01:09:25,334 --> 01:09:26,876
Do you have any sense at all?

1341
01:09:26,959 --> 01:09:29,042
Couldn't you sit
with mum for 5 minutes?

1342
01:10:03,334 --> 01:10:04,876
I don't know about Dadu...

1343
01:10:05,834 --> 01:10:07,584
but everyone
else sure was surprised.

1344
01:10:07,667 --> 01:10:08,459
Yeah!

1345
01:10:08,667 --> 01:10:10,792
Do you think Dad and Anu Aunty...?

1346
01:10:11,042 --> 01:10:12,334
No, man...

1347
01:10:13,001 --> 01:10:14,917
Dad's a lot of things but he's
not a cheater.

1348
01:10:15,001 --> 01:10:16,792
Morn just overreacts...

1349
01:10:17,376 --> 01:10:18,501
Morn and overreaction?!

1350
01:10:18,626 --> 01:10:22,709
Shut up... How's your
novel coming along?

1351
01:10:23,251 --> 01:10:24,376
Have you got a publisher?

1352
01:10:24,459 --> 01:10:26,792
No, man... Same old crap...

1353
01:10:27,417 --> 01:10:28,292
What crap?

1354
01:10:28,417 --> 01:10:32,167
Everyone wants a happy ending...

1355
01:10:33,376 --> 01:10:34,417
And your story?

1356
01:10:34,917 --> 01:10:35,792
It's real.

1357
01:10:37,376 --> 01:10:40,167
And real life never
guarantees a happy ending...

1358
01:10:42,667 --> 01:10:44,709
Isn't that why we
look for it in stories?

1359
01:10:54,626 --> 01:10:58,042
Sometimes I wish
I had finished college...

1360
01:10:58,251 --> 01:11:00,626
Or completed the photography course...

1361
01:11:00,876 --> 01:11:05,084
Maybe I wouldn't be as successful as
you, but at least I'd have a back up.

1362
01:11:06,751 --> 01:11:08,126
Don't be so stressed...

1363
01:11:08,626 --> 01:11:10,751
Easy for you to say...

1364
01:11:11,042 --> 01:11:14,334
You're a successful novelist...
an entrepreneur...

1365
01:11:16,167 --> 01:11:20,626
...and what am I ? I'm just a part-time
bartender struggling to be a writer.

1366
01:11:20,959 --> 01:11:22,667
What's wrong with that?

1367
01:11:23,209 --> 01:11:25,834
Every struggler works
part-time... I've done it!

1368
01:11:26,292 --> 01:11:28,042
Yeah, but for how long?!

1369
01:11:30,792 --> 01:11:34,292
As a kid, I used to wonder
what you had that I didn't...

1370
01:11:35,459 --> 01:11:39,042
It took me all these years to
realise that this is who I am...

1371
01:11:39,709 --> 01:11:41,626
I'm second best...

1372
01:11:42,959 --> 01:11:44,626
I'm just a runner up.

1373
01:11:52,042 --> 01:11:53,417
Listen...

1374
01:11:54,667 --> 01:11:56,251
if you're comfortable with it...

1375
01:11:56,459 --> 01:11:58,417
I can talk to an agent for you.

1376
01:11:58,876 --> 01:12:00,876
I could even read your
novel... give you feedback.

1377
01:12:01,209 --> 01:12:02,417
If you're okay with it.

1378
01:12:05,626 --> 01:12:07,501
I haven't carried a copy with me...

1379
01:12:08,834 --> 01:12:12,542
Well, okay... But if you
ever need help... just ask.

1380
01:12:13,501 --> 01:12:14,209
Ya!

1381
01:12:14,334 --> 01:12:16,209
Or else you could give it to Morn...

1382
01:12:16,584 --> 01:12:19,042
Her feedback is surprisingly great.

1383
01:12:20,042 --> 01:12:21,167
Really...

1384
01:12:23,501 --> 01:12:24,751
Tell me something...

1385
01:12:25,792 --> 01:12:27,542
What do you think of Tia?

1386
01:12:28,167 --> 01:12:29,209
Tia...

1387
01:12:29,501 --> 01:12:33,459
Dude, she is so hot!
I'm going for it.

1388
01:12:34,501 --> 01:12:35,876
Really?

1389
01:12:37,751 --> 01:12:39,501
Look at your face!

1390
01:12:39,584 --> 01:12:42,542
I have no interest in her.
Relax. You make your move...

1391
01:12:42,959 --> 01:12:44,501
I'm very happy in my relationship.

1392
01:12:44,917 --> 01:12:46,542
Ah... video chat!

1393
01:12:47,251 --> 01:12:48,709
She's hot or what?

1394
01:12:49,751 --> 01:12:50,626
She's good.

1395
01:12:51,584 --> 01:12:53,376
Dude, but you can't even drive...

1396
01:12:53,459 --> 01:12:54,834
I can please her in other ways!

1397
01:12:54,917 --> 01:12:56,126
- Really!
- Want me to teach you?

1398
01:12:56,251 --> 01:12:57,459
Yeah, right.

1399
01:12:58,334 --> 01:12:59,834
Actually, today let me teach you.

1400
01:13:00,584 --> 01:13:01,542
Catch!

1401
01:13:02,792 --> 01:13:04,501
- Accelerate, man...

1402
01:13:04,751 --> 01:13:06,459
- The bloody music is distracting me!

1403
01:13:06,584 --> 01:13:08,251
- Careful, careful, careful!

1404
01:13:08,542 --> 01:13:09,584
- Sorry, bro!

1405
01:13:09,751 --> 01:13:11,209
You almost killed him!

1406
01:13:11,417 --> 01:13:12,584
You drive then, Schumacher!

1407
01:13:12,709 --> 01:13:15,417
Shut this guy up, man!
Why is he honking at me!

1408
01:13:15,501 --> 01:13:16,667
Chill, man!

1409
01:13:17,209 --> 01:13:18,417
Geishu! Attack!

1410
01:13:19,751 --> 01:13:21,542
Are you in labour or what?!

1411
01:13:21,626 --> 01:13:23,626
Okay, I have an idea...

1412
01:13:23,876 --> 01:13:25,209
- Something I saw on the internet...

1413
01:13:25,501 --> 01:13:26,709
Drive on the side...

1414
01:13:26,959 --> 01:13:28,709
- What are you planning?
- Just wait...

1415
01:13:29,751 --> 01:13:32,667
- What are you doing, man?
- You drive like an old lady!

1416
01:13:32,917 --> 01:13:33,876
Hi!

1417
01:13:36,376 --> 01:13:37,292
Take that!

1418
01:13:40,334 --> 01:13:42,876
- Arjun! Arjun! What do I do?!
- Brake !! Brake!! Brake!!

1419
01:13:47,584 --> 01:13:48,417
Geishu!

1420
01:13:51,001 --> 01:13:51,917
Uh oh...

1421
01:13:52,042 --> 01:13:53,376
Oh, man...

1422
01:13:59,792 --> 01:14:00,959
What do we do?

1423
01:14:06,709 --> 01:14:08,292
There's a hammer in the garage...

1424
01:14:08,751 --> 01:14:10,501
Break everything in the house...

1425
01:14:11,501 --> 01:14:12,959
TV, fridge, AC... why not?

1426
01:14:13,042 --> 01:14:16,542
Dad, it's not his fault,
it's mine... I was driving.

1427
01:14:23,501 --> 01:14:26,251
What an embarrassing scolding!

1428
01:14:26,584 --> 01:14:28,042
He didn't even call
you an idiot or a jackass!

1429
01:14:28,126 --> 01:14:29,334
Come on!

1430
01:14:30,626 --> 01:14:32,251
- Rahul! Arjun!

1431
01:14:32,626 --> 01:14:34,542
Dadu's called everyone inside.

1432
01:14:35,126 --> 01:14:36,876
Let's go, step child.

1433
01:14:43,126 --> 01:14:45,334
This cake tastes like poop!

1434
01:14:46,459 --> 01:14:47,792
You've tasted poop, Dadu?

1435
01:14:47,959 --> 01:14:49,501
Shut up, you fool!

1436
01:14:49,584 --> 01:14:52,042
It's sugar free because
of your diabetes.

1437
01:14:53,459 --> 01:14:58,501
I would rather die eating
sugar than relive that party.

1438
01:15:00,292 --> 01:15:05,334
So... Is anyone going
to apologise for yesterday?

1439
01:15:10,334 --> 01:15:11,959
Okay, I'll start...

1440
01:15:13,209 --> 01:15:18,292
I'm sorry for calling
that idiot Choksi a shithead.

1441
01:15:19,417 --> 01:15:23,834
By the way... who invited Choksi?

1442
01:15:28,792 --> 01:15:29,709
I'm sorry, Dadu...

1443
01:15:31,792 --> 01:15:34,292
And... who invited Anu?

1444
01:15:39,667 --> 01:15:41,334
That was me, again...

1445
01:15:41,876 --> 01:15:44,959
I just thought I'd invite
some of Dad's colleagues...

1446
01:15:46,334 --> 01:15:47,459
Sorry...

1447
01:15:50,209 --> 01:15:51,917
Alright then, that's settled.

1448
01:15:52,167 --> 01:15:53,459
Can I have that?

1449
01:15:53,709 --> 01:15:56,376
- What are you doing?
- My toy... My wish.

1450
01:15:56,501 --> 01:15:57,626
Go stand there.

1451
01:15:58,001 --> 01:16:00,001
- I want to take a picture...
- Come on, Dad...

1452
01:16:00,167 --> 01:16:01,917
- Okay guys, gather around.

1453
01:16:03,459 --> 01:16:05,417
Smile, smile, smile...

1454
01:16:05,584 --> 01:16:06,584
Smile...

1455
01:16:09,042 --> 01:16:11,417
I wish Shashi and family were here...

1456
01:16:11,584 --> 01:16:14,917
- I would have my happy family photo.
- He's coming tonight.

1457
01:16:15,001 --> 01:16:16,542
And you can have your family photo!

1458
01:16:16,626 --> 01:16:19,584
We must click the photograph soon...

1459
01:16:19,834 --> 01:16:22,626
...or else I might be
the one cut out of it!

1460
01:16:22,876 --> 01:16:25,501
Dad, why must you
always talk about dying?

1461
01:16:25,792 --> 01:16:32,251
Speaking of death... Rahul,
have you booked my burial spot?

1462
01:16:32,376 --> 01:16:33,167
- What?!
- Dadu... I...

1463
01:16:33,376 --> 01:16:34,376
What's this new nonsense?

1464
01:16:34,459 --> 01:16:37,917
Dadu said he wants to be
buried... I thought it was a joke...

1465
01:16:38,042 --> 01:16:39,584
Dad, they won't allow it!

1466
01:16:39,667 --> 01:16:41,542
People can't just
change their religion!

1467
01:16:41,667 --> 01:16:45,501
Whether you're a man or tomato...
once you're dead, you're dead.

1468
01:16:47,167 --> 01:16:49,251
- Arjun!
- Yes?

1469
01:16:49,542 --> 01:16:52,376
Go book my burial spot...

1470
01:16:52,751 --> 01:16:54,001
Umm... Dad?

1471
01:16:54,459 --> 01:16:55,251
Dad!

1472
01:16:55,334 --> 01:16:59,542
What, Dad-Dad?!
I'm dying, not him!

1473
01:16:59,876 --> 01:17:02,084
I never know what's
going on in this house...

1474
01:17:06,501 --> 01:17:07,876
- Where are we going?

1475
01:17:08,126 --> 01:17:10,417
- On a date.
- Ohh... Hawaii!

1476
01:17:11,334 --> 01:17:13,126
Nah... even better!

1477
01:17:13,417 --> 01:17:14,209
Really!

1478
01:17:14,292 --> 01:17:15,792
Really. You'll see!

1479
01:17:29,751 --> 01:17:32,251
What would your tombstone read?

1480
01:17:34,667 --> 01:17:35,834
Tia Mallik...

1481
01:17:36,834 --> 01:17:38,834
Struck down by Boobly's love...

1482
01:17:39,334 --> 01:17:40,626
For eternity.

1483
01:17:40,792 --> 01:17:42,126
So romantic...

1484
01:17:42,376 --> 01:17:44,292
I can make my pecs dance like Boobly.

1485
01:17:44,917 --> 01:17:46,126
Let's see!

1486
01:17:46,584 --> 01:17:47,751
Hang on...

1487
01:17:50,334 --> 01:17:52,376
- Nothing's happening!
- It's inside the t-shirt!

1488
01:17:52,459 --> 01:17:53,792
Show me, then!

1489
01:17:55,959 --> 01:17:57,751
There's no one like Boobly!

1490
01:18:09,001 --> 01:18:11,376
- I don't know Rahul that well...

1491
01:18:12,334 --> 01:18:13,584
but...

1492
01:18:14,209 --> 01:18:18,459
Maybe the similarities between
your novels really was co-incidence?

1493
01:18:22,584 --> 01:18:23,792
Maybe.

1494
01:18:26,584 --> 01:18:29,292
You're really defending
him... What's up?

1495
01:18:31,126 --> 01:18:32,417
Nothing at all...

1496
01:18:33,042 --> 01:18:34,917
Really... you can tell me!

1497
01:18:43,584 --> 01:18:45,167
I got you something!

1498
01:18:46,126 --> 01:18:47,209
Really?

1499
01:18:47,292 --> 01:18:48,209
What?

1500
01:18:50,167 --> 01:18:51,459
What are you doing?!

1501
01:18:51,542 --> 01:18:52,459
Tia...

1502
01:18:52,542 --> 01:18:53,251
Arjun?

1503
01:18:53,334 --> 01:18:54,792
Will you...

1504
01:18:56,917 --> 01:18:58,209
have some sweet cigarettes?

1505
01:18:58,292 --> 01:19:00,834
Oh my God! Are you serious?!

1506
01:19:01,042 --> 01:19:02,876
How can I say no?

1507
01:19:03,542 --> 01:19:04,251
Light?

1508
01:19:04,334 --> 01:19:05,667
Oh! Yes, ma'am!

1509
01:19:07,584 --> 01:19:08,792
Thank you.

1510
01:19:51,876 --> 01:19:53,917
Listen, I'm sorry about yesterday...

1511
01:19:54,459 --> 01:19:55,751
About Choksi Uncle and Dadu...

1512
01:19:55,876 --> 01:19:57,334
Are you crazy?! I'm sorry!

1513
01:19:57,626 --> 01:19:59,626
My family doesn't
usually behave like that...

1514
01:20:00,792 --> 01:20:01,751
Correction...

1515
01:20:02,292 --> 01:20:04,376
they don't behave
like that in public.

1516
01:20:05,751 --> 01:20:07,834
You should be happy you have a family...

1517
01:20:12,209 --> 01:20:14,626
You really miss your family, don't you?

1518
01:20:22,376 --> 01:20:23,292
So!

1519
01:20:24,167 --> 01:20:26,001
What would your tombstone say?

1520
01:20:26,709 --> 01:20:28,876
Let's see... Arjun Kapoor...

1521
01:20:29,709 --> 01:20:31,917
from 1985 tom'?

1522
01:20:32,251 --> 01:20:33,876
2050, at least!

1523
01:20:33,959 --> 01:20:35,959
Okay, 2050 at least.

1524
01:20:36,876 --> 01:20:38,459
Right... Okay...

1525
01:20:41,542 --> 01:20:43,042
'These are my last few words...'

1526
01:20:44,001 --> 01:20:45,667
'Remember my story... If you can.'

1527
01:20:52,834 --> 01:20:54,292
That's damn impressive!

1528
01:20:54,917 --> 01:20:55,959
You like it?

1529
01:20:57,209 --> 01:20:59,876
I mean... Oh, look at me, I'm a writer...

1530
01:21:00,376 --> 01:21:01,417
Yeah...

1531
01:21:01,876 --> 01:21:03,292
Just a little... Thank you.

1532
01:21:11,334 --> 01:21:13,251
- Thanks for these.
- You're welcome...

1533
01:21:13,709 --> 01:21:15,209
How much longer are you here?

1534
01:21:15,834 --> 01:21:17,584
<i>2</i> days... and you?

1535
01:21:18,584 --> 01:21:19,584
4 days...

1536
01:21:19,751 --> 01:21:20,584
Oh.

1537
01:21:26,709 --> 01:21:31,251
Okay, listen... this may sound
a bit crazy... but...

1538
01:21:33,376 --> 01:21:35,251
When we're together...

1539
01:21:36,126 --> 01:21:38,292
I don't know... It feels like...

1540
01:21:39,251 --> 01:21:40,709
It just... Something just...

1541
01:21:42,251 --> 01:21:43,376
- Fits?
- Yeah...

1542
01:21:43,834 --> 01:21:45,209
Does it feel like that to you?

1543
01:21:45,751 --> 01:21:46,626
Yeah.

1544
01:21:48,292 --> 01:21:49,626
Stay back a few days?

1545
01:21:52,834 --> 01:21:55,251
If not for me, then for Bunkoo?

1546
01:21:56,126 --> 01:21:56,834
Bunkoo...

1547
01:21:57,167 --> 01:22:01,126
For Bunkoo... I'm convinced. Yes!

1548
01:22:01,501 --> 01:22:03,292
Why few days... at least 10!

1549
01:22:06,292 --> 01:22:07,959
I had a great day...

1550
01:22:08,167 --> 01:22:09,417
Me too.

1551
01:22:10,542 --> 01:22:11,709
Okay, bye!

1552
01:22:15,876 --> 01:22:17,334
- Bye...
- Bye...

1553
01:22:19,001 --> 01:22:20,001
Bye...

1554
01:22:24,917 --> 01:22:26,251
I was in a graveyard.

1555
01:22:28,292 --> 01:22:29,542
On a date...

1556
01:22:34,042 --> 01:22:35,501
With Arjun...

1557
01:22:36,042 --> 01:22:36,917
Yeah...

1558
01:22:40,042 --> 01:22:41,501
I really like him.

1559
01:22:42,792 --> 01:22:47,251
I wish I hadn't made such
a mess by kissing his brother!

1560
01:22:52,917 --> 01:22:55,501
- Arjun, where are the car keys?

1561
01:22:56,584 --> 01:22:58,667
- Arjun! Where is he?!

1562
01:23:05,167 --> 01:23:06,042
- Arjun?

1563
01:23:22,501 --> 01:23:23,626
What's up?

1564
01:23:24,334 --> 01:23:27,251
Nothing! Mom's phone is here...

1565
01:23:27,417 --> 01:23:29,084
She asked for it...

1566
01:23:29,667 --> 01:23:31,167
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

1567
01:23:32,876 --> 01:23:36,251
- Arjun! Rahul!
Look who's here! It's Shashi Uncle!

1568
01:23:36,584 --> 01:23:38,667
Sorry Dadu, we missed your birthday...

1569
01:23:40,292 --> 01:23:42,917
And finally!! Uncle! Aunty!

1570
01:23:43,084 --> 01:23:45,042
Hi! How are you?

1571
01:23:45,251 --> 01:23:47,376
- Hi Aunty, looking nice!
- How was the cruise?

1572
01:23:50,292 --> 01:23:51,501
Hey Rahul!

1573
01:23:52,251 --> 01:23:54,959
Look how excited Dadu
is with his wheelchair!

1574
01:23:55,126 --> 01:23:57,334
- Don't worry about it,
we've booked a room at Elgon Hotel.

1575
01:23:57,584 --> 01:23:59,042
He says he's going to a hotel!

1576
01:23:59,209 --> 01:24:03,251
You're home now, idiot...
You're staying here!

1577
01:24:04,001 --> 01:24:07,792
Listen now! I want to take a
picture of the whole family tomorrow.

1578
01:24:07,959 --> 01:24:09,251
- I want to put it up.

1579
01:24:09,334 --> 01:24:12,251
You know that duffer friend of yours...

1580
01:24:12,334 --> 01:24:14,417
The photographer? I'll call him!

1581
01:24:14,667 --> 01:24:16,126
- Dharmendra, take the bags in now!

1582
01:24:16,501 --> 01:24:18,251
Take these bags into the room.

1583
01:24:19,626 --> 01:24:21,792
Come on, let's all have dinner.

1584
01:24:23,667 --> 01:24:26,376
- Sunita, look what I found!
- What?

1585
01:24:26,459 --> 01:24:28,334
Gorgeous pictures!

1586
01:24:28,626 --> 01:24:30,459
That's from our honeymoon...

1587
01:24:30,667 --> 01:24:33,334
Some wine for the hardworking ladies!

1588
01:24:33,417 --> 01:24:34,834
Thank you!

1589
01:24:35,126 --> 01:24:38,001
Wow! Please teach her something...

1590
01:24:38,084 --> 01:24:40,251
Shut up! Just go!

1591
01:24:40,292 --> 01:24:43,376
Sunita, ask Timmy to
e-mail me some recipes.

1592
01:24:43,584 --> 01:24:45,334
Sharic just loves this stuff!

1593
01:24:45,459 --> 01:24:47,292
Of course,
she'll e-mail you tomorrow itself!

1594
01:24:47,417 --> 01:24:50,334
Sunita! This custard is delicious!

1595
01:24:51,292 --> 01:24:53,209
- Rahul, you ass!

1596
01:24:53,376 --> 01:24:54,626
Let me have a little!

1597
01:24:54,751 --> 01:24:55,542
- Dad...

1598
01:24:55,626 --> 01:24:57,167
Dad! You're not allowed!
Doctors' instructions!

1599
01:24:57,251 --> 01:24:58,292
Just one!

1600
01:24:58,376 --> 01:25:00,876
Sunita, you look like
a Bollywood actress!

1601
01:25:00,959 --> 01:25:02,042
Let me see!

1602
01:25:03,542 --> 01:25:04,834
Wow! Seriously!

1603
01:25:05,001 --> 01:25:07,167
- She really does!

1604
01:25:08,501 --> 01:25:09,584
Wow...

1605
01:25:09,917 --> 01:25:12,251
Please, Sharic... I was way
better looking than you!

1606
01:25:12,334 --> 01:25:14,792
Girls used to line
up here for Shashi and me!

1607
01:25:14,876 --> 01:25:15,792
Of course!

1608
01:25:15,959 --> 01:25:17,876
- Rubbish, Dad...
- Hang on!

1609
01:25:18,417 --> 01:25:20,417
They used to line up for me.

1610
01:25:21,042 --> 01:25:23,126
- Absolutely right!
- Correct, Dadu!

1611
01:25:23,209 --> 01:25:25,084
- And what was Grandma doing?
- She was long gone!

1612
01:25:25,251 --> 01:25:27,667
Whatever it is! I miss those days...

1613
01:25:27,876 --> 01:25:30,167
I wouldn't give those memories
up for a million dollars...

1614
01:25:30,292 --> 01:25:31,501
Oh, Uncle...

1615
01:25:31,584 --> 01:25:33,417
Please! You'd eat poop
for a million dollars!

1616
01:25:33,584 --> 01:25:34,626
- Yuck!
- Dad!

1617
01:25:36,042 --> 01:25:38,084
You'll would all eat
poop for 10 million dollars!

1618
01:25:38,251 --> 01:25:40,209
Sharic would eat poop for 50 bucks!

1619
01:25:41,584 --> 01:25:42,501
- So Sharic...

1620
01:25:43,209 --> 01:25:45,042
ls the guitar just for girls or...

1621
01:25:45,126 --> 01:25:47,334
- No, no! I play!
- Play some Mehmood!

1622
01:25:47,417 --> 01:25:49,751
- Justin Bieber, bro!
- No Justin Bieber!

1623
01:25:49,917 --> 01:25:51,251
Play something vintage!

1624
01:25:51,959 --> 01:25:54,251
Rahul also sings!
Rahul, come on, sing!

1625
01:25:54,501 --> 01:25:57,167
Please, please! Come on, Rahul!

1626
01:25:57,251 --> 01:25:59,084
- Sing what...
- Your Dad's favourite!

1627
01:25:59,167 --> 01:26:00,876
The one he sang at his wedding!
Remember?

1628
01:26:00,959 --> 01:26:02,251
Me?! No way...

1629
01:26:02,542 --> 01:26:04,334
"The way you look tonight!"

1630
01:26:05,501 --> 01:26:07,417
In the voice of Lata
Mangeshkar... Rahul!

1631
01:26:07,501 --> 01:26:08,626
Let’s go!

1632
01:26:09,126 --> 01:26:11,251
1, 2, 3... 1, 2, 3...

1633
01:27:07,792 --> 01:27:08,626
- WOW, Dad!

1634
01:27:38,584 --> 01:27:40,042
- Well done, Rahul-
- Kapoor!

1635
01:27:40,501 --> 01:27:41,334
- Wonderfully done!

1636
01:27:41,542 --> 01:27:44,084
Goodnight, my little princess!

1637
01:27:44,209 --> 01:27:46,667
You smell like Geishu!

1638
01:27:53,626 --> 01:27:55,001
Goodnight.

1639
01:27:56,251 --> 01:27:57,376
Goodnight.

1640
01:28:00,876 --> 01:28:03,251
I haven't seen you this happy
in a long time... It suits you.

1641
01:28:07,292 --> 01:28:08,376
Goodnight!

1642
01:28:13,251 --> 01:28:15,584
Dadu... Aunty got this for Morn!

1643
01:28:15,667 --> 01:28:18,959
Shut up and tell me how
long I have to keep this on!

1644
01:28:22,001 --> 01:28:23,501
15 minutes...

1645
01:28:24,376 --> 01:28:25,292
15 minutes?

1646
01:28:26,376 --> 01:28:28,292
Okay, switch off the lights.

1647
01:28:29,084 --> 01:28:29,917
Why?!

1648
01:28:30,001 --> 01:28:32,292
Because I said so!

1649
01:28:34,792 --> 01:28:37,459
Open the drawer... the first one!

1650
01:28:38,459 --> 01:28:39,876
See my underwear there?

1651
01:28:40,042 --> 01:28:41,042
What are you making me do?!

1652
01:28:41,126 --> 01:28:43,417
There's a box underneath. Open it...

1653
01:28:47,084 --> 01:28:48,667
Take the joint out.

1654
01:28:51,251 --> 01:28:53,084
Dadu... You'll have me killed!

1655
01:28:53,459 --> 01:28:55,542
Remember this? Gulmarg...

1656
01:28:57,751 --> 01:28:59,751
- Sonmarg.
- Yeah, Sonmarg...

1657
01:29:00,334 --> 01:29:05,917
And that ski instructor
who kept trying to grab your hand.

1658
01:29:06,251 --> 01:29:09,584
- Remember this?
When you threw all my clothes out?

1659
01:29:09,959 --> 01:29:14,917
So'? You promised me a day
out and worked all clay instead.

1660
01:29:15,417 --> 01:29:19,626
Didn't I make it up
to you with my towel dance?

1661
01:29:21,959 --> 01:29:23,751
Yes, I saw the pictures...

1662
01:29:25,501 --> 01:29:28,626
You look nice.
A tad bit overweight... but cute.

1663
01:29:30,084 --> 01:29:32,251
But do you have to sit next to Chris?

1664
01:29:33,459 --> 01:29:35,792
No, I'm not the jealous type.

1665
01:29:36,876 --> 01:29:39,209
Listen... I'll talk to you later, yeah?

1666
01:29:39,667 --> 01:29:40,459
I love you too.

1667
01:29:42,459 --> 01:29:44,126
2 drags and you're
already breaking glasses?

1668
01:29:44,251 --> 01:29:46,042
You're going to get me killed...

1669
01:29:46,126 --> 01:29:48,834
Just relax, son...

1670
01:29:52,876 --> 01:29:54,792
- Hold this, hold this!
- Why me?!

1671
01:29:56,292 --> 01:29:58,417
- It's Rahul! Come on in.
- Hey...

1672
01:29:59,626 --> 01:30:00,417
What's going on?

1673
01:30:00,501 --> 01:30:03,626
I've applied a mud cap...
The doctor recommended it...

1674
01:30:03,917 --> 01:30:05,376
Yeah, the doctors...

1675
01:30:08,542 --> 01:30:11,501
If you're done praying,
take the incense out...

1676
01:30:11,751 --> 01:30:12,917
Ummm...

1677
01:30:19,751 --> 01:30:21,834
Let's see the... incense.

1678
01:30:23,167 --> 01:30:24,792
Oh, damn it!

1679
01:30:25,626 --> 01:30:26,626
Show me!

1680
01:30:27,292 --> 01:30:29,459
Busted!

1681
01:30:31,126 --> 01:30:32,917
Outlaws...

1682
01:30:33,251 --> 01:30:35,167
Wicked!

1683
01:30:44,542 --> 01:30:47,042
We used to be so happy...

1684
01:30:51,334 --> 01:30:53,667
Sunita, I was thinking...

1685
01:30:55,042 --> 01:30:56,376
If you want to...

1686
01:30:57,292 --> 01:31:02,501
start your catering
business... you should.

1687
01:31:09,626 --> 01:31:13,501
I'll try and help
in whatever way I can...

1688
01:31:14,001 --> 01:31:16,876
Is this the alcohol talking?

1689
01:31:20,126 --> 01:31:22,459
What would Grandma think
if she were here today...

1690
01:31:22,626 --> 01:31:28,626
You have no idea... She would be
taking a hit or two of the joint herself!

1691
01:31:29,042 --> 01:31:31,042
- Dadu!
- What nonsense, Dadu!

1692
01:31:31,209 --> 01:31:33,542
I'm telling you guys!

1693
01:31:34,042 --> 01:31:39,209
We used be quite the
'wild couple' in our times!

1694
01:31:40,167 --> 01:31:43,126
Then I've definitely fallen
on you guys!

1695
01:31:44,126 --> 01:31:46,667
This poor fellow turned
out like Morn and Dad...

1696
01:31:46,751 --> 01:31:48,292
What rubbish! I'm Wild.

1697
01:31:48,917 --> 01:31:49,917
- You?!
- Yeah!

1698
01:31:50,001 --> 01:31:51,626
- I'm wild!
- You're wild?

1699
01:31:51,792 --> 01:31:53,709
- I'm wild, dude!
- Wild people can drive!

1700
01:31:53,792 --> 01:31:56,376
- Shut up, I'm wild!
- Ya, right...

1701
01:31:56,542 --> 01:31:59,417
Okay, fine.
Tell us one of your wild tales.

1702
01:32:00,417 --> 01:32:04,334
In Hawaii last year...
I got drunk and got a tattoo.

1703
01:32:04,626 --> 01:32:06,459
What?! Tattoo?!

1704
01:32:06,751 --> 01:32:08,709
Is that a tattoo of pigeons?!

1705
01:32:10,501 --> 01:32:12,126
He got a tattoo!!!

1706
01:32:14,667 --> 01:32:18,459
Sunita, I just got tangled
up in so many things...

1707
01:32:21,376 --> 01:32:23,667
Before I knew it,
time had slipped away...

1708
01:32:26,084 --> 01:32:27,209
I'm sorry.

1709
01:32:28,792 --> 01:32:31,667
I may be drunk, but it's the truth...

1710
01:32:37,584 --> 01:32:39,792
Can't we be happy again?

1711
01:32:43,334 --> 01:32:44,751
We can try...

1712
01:32:52,417 --> 01:32:53,584
You're lost in thought?

1713
01:32:54,751 --> 01:32:56,167
I was just thinking...

1714
01:32:56,459 --> 01:32:58,751
For 10 million dollars...
I could eat some poop.

1715
01:32:58,834 --> 01:33:00,792
You'll eat it for 5!

1716
01:33:00,876 --> 01:33:02,376
Yeah... but with cheese.

1717
01:33:02,501 --> 01:33:04,042
Yuck!

1718
01:33:06,626 --> 01:33:08,376
Dude, where did
Dadu score that shit from?

1719
01:33:09,459 --> 01:33:10,876
Who knows...

1720
01:33:12,792 --> 01:33:15,667
You're not as perfect as you act...

1721
01:33:16,126 --> 01:33:19,292
How did you become the favourite son?

1722
01:33:22,042 --> 01:33:23,459
That's not true.

1723
01:33:24,126 --> 01:33:25,917
Morn and Dad love us equally.

1724
01:33:30,126 --> 01:33:32,417
You asshole... you can't even
say that with a straight face!

1725
01:33:32,542 --> 01:33:33,876
I am serious.

1726
01:33:36,084 --> 01:33:38,584
I would take your
place in a heartbeat.

1727
01:33:38,792 --> 01:33:40,042
Shut up...

1728
01:33:41,501 --> 01:33:43,042
Arjun, can I tell you something?

1729
01:33:45,126 --> 01:33:46,459
Something no one knows...

1730
01:33:52,001 --> 01:33:52,834
Arjun!

1731
01:34:14,959 --> 01:34:16,501
I thought you could wear this...

1732
01:34:16,667 --> 01:34:18,417
- Is it okay?
- Thank you.

1733
01:34:21,542 --> 01:34:22,834
Coffee...

1734
01:34:25,792 --> 01:34:28,001
I'll just go give
the car to the mechanic.

1735
01:34:28,376 --> 01:34:29,376
Now?!

1736
01:34:29,459 --> 01:34:30,876
Yeah, just get it out of the way...

1737
01:34:31,084 --> 01:34:33,667
Everyone's waiting outside!

1738
01:34:36,584 --> 01:34:38,459
I'll be back quickly. Where's Shashi?

1739
01:34:38,542 --> 01:34:40,542
- Pleasure meeting you.
- You too, sir.

1740
01:34:40,667 --> 01:34:43,167
- Okay, we'll talk later.
- Yeah. Sorry, I'm just...

1741
01:34:43,334 --> 01:34:44,417
Bye.

1742
01:34:46,376 --> 01:34:47,209
What's up, man?

1743
01:34:47,292 --> 01:34:48,876
You'll carry on...
I'll come in a bit.

1744
01:34:51,126 --> 01:34:51,834
Very bad...

1745
01:34:51,917 --> 01:34:53,876
I can't let you do this. No, Arjun...

1746
01:34:54,126 --> 01:34:58,417
- The car needs to go back.
- I'll come on my own!

1747
01:34:58,876 --> 01:35:01,459
That's where my family
portrait will be.

1748
01:35:01,917 --> 01:35:06,376
Timmy, you haven't sent the recipes!
Okay wait, I'll check.

1749
01:35:06,834 --> 01:35:08,709
Wow, Sunita, you look lovely!

1750
01:35:09,042 --> 01:35:10,209
Just speaking to Timmy for you!

1751
01:35:10,584 --> 01:35:12,751
I'll check on Rahul's laptop...

1752
01:35:13,626 --> 01:35:15,917
Uff, Dad... Too handsome!

1753
01:35:16,501 --> 01:35:18,501
No, no... Aunty wished me already.

1754
01:35:19,001 --> 01:35:21,626
Thank you for calling... and wishing...

1755
01:35:22,042 --> 01:35:23,084
Bye.

1756
01:35:24,751 --> 01:35:26,251
Is today your birthday?

1757
01:35:27,876 --> 01:35:29,042
Seriously?

1758
01:35:30,167 --> 01:35:32,667
T! Happy birthday!

1759
01:35:32,834 --> 01:35:33,751
Thank you...

1760
01:35:33,959 --> 01:35:36,709
I'd have brought a
cutout of Boobly if I knew!

1761
01:35:40,001 --> 01:35:42,792
Why aren't you more excited
about your birthday?!

1762
01:35:47,501 --> 01:35:49,542
- It's loading, hang on!

1763
01:35:49,876 --> 01:35:50,709
- Sunita!

1764
01:35:50,876 --> 01:35:53,001
Sorry, one sec... I'll call back.

1765
01:35:53,126 --> 01:35:54,376
Which one?

1766
01:35:54,542 --> 01:35:55,542
This one!

1767
01:35:55,667 --> 01:35:56,667
<i>'</i> Okay!

1768
01:35:58,126 --> 01:36:00,959
You should think of investing
in my Artist Retreat!

1769
01:36:03,376 --> 01:36:05,251
Raj, stop the car... Stop the car.

1770
01:36:06,042 --> 01:36:07,126
What's wrong?

1771
01:36:07,626 --> 01:36:10,042
No, I just remembered
I have to see a friend...

1772
01:36:10,251 --> 01:36:11,417
Should I wait?

1773
01:36:13,709 --> 01:36:15,417
No, you guys carry on.

1774
01:36:15,876 --> 01:36:18,042
- Do you know the way?
- Yes, sir!

1775
01:36:46,292 --> 01:36:47,459
Hello? Dad?

1776
01:36:47,667 --> 01:36:48,876
- I'll be home in a bit...

1777
01:36:49,042 --> 01:36:52,709
Just finishing work at the garage...
will be home in half an hour.

1778
01:36:56,209 --> 01:36:57,876
Time to go, right?

1779
01:37:02,292 --> 01:37:05,501
Seems like your mind
is made up... and that's fine.

1780
01:37:05,751 --> 01:37:09,376
Nothing's fine... but
I'm trying to change that.

1781
01:37:32,376 --> 01:37:35,334
It was my 13th birthday...

1782
01:37:36,376 --> 01:37:41,709
Morn and Dad were returning
from Canada after my Uncle's surgery...

1783
01:37:44,042 --> 01:37:45,667
I was really pissed off...

1784
01:37:46,584 --> 01:37:49,792
They were missing my birthday...

1785
01:37:52,709 --> 01:37:55,917
They called me before
boarding the flight...

1786
01:37:57,584 --> 01:37:59,167
I was angry...

1787
01:38:00,667 --> 01:38:03,209
So told them not
to bother coming back...

1788
01:38:03,792 --> 01:38:07,417
I don't need a Morn and Dad!
I'm fine alone! Don't come back.

1789
01:38:13,001 --> 01:38:14,334
The plane crashed.

1790
01:38:19,417 --> 01:38:22,376
My Uncle waited 2 days to tell me...

1791
01:38:22,542 --> 01:38:24,542
Til they found the bodies

1792
01:38:33,501 --> 01:38:37,292
It was the last time...
I ever spoke to them...

1793
01:38:37,376 --> 01:38:40,084
...and I was horrible...

1794
01:38:41,876 --> 01:38:45,042
That phone call haunts
me on every birthday!

1795
01:38:46,126 --> 01:38:48,084
I could have said so many things...

1796
01:38:50,376 --> 01:38:52,001
Like I love you!

1797
01:38:52,584 --> 01:38:56,042
I love you... Just come back...
I miss you!

1798
01:38:56,376 --> 01:38:58,126
I've missed you!

1799
01:39:05,584 --> 01:39:07,626
Just please come back...

1800
01:39:08,417 --> 01:39:10,209
It's all I wanted to say.

1801
01:39:33,834 --> 01:39:35,084
Hello...

1802
01:39:36,917 --> 01:39:37,959
ls Dad there?

1803
01:39:39,959 --> 01:39:41,042
Rahul...

1804
01:39:42,042 --> 01:39:43,459
Stop!

1805
01:40:05,292 --> 01:40:06,292
Rahul!

1806
01:40:53,042 --> 01:40:54,001
Sorry.

1807
01:40:55,584 --> 01:40:56,959
Excuse me for a second...

1808
01:41:05,251 --> 01:41:07,209
You have to tell him.

1809
01:41:13,376 --> 01:41:14,251
- Arjun...

1810
01:41:15,459 --> 01:41:17,626
I have to tell you something.

1811
01:41:19,167 --> 01:41:23,834
Please don't judge me...
I was drunk.

1812
01:41:24,417 --> 01:41:27,126
- Catch that thief! Catch her!

1813
01:41:27,334 --> 01:41:30,209
Rahul! Look what I taught the kids!

1814
01:41:35,209 --> 01:41:38,876
- Tell everyone to hurry up!
- It's going to rain...

1815
01:41:39,042 --> 01:41:40,917
Bite your black tongue you jackass!

1816
01:41:41,126 --> 01:41:41,959
Rahul!

1817
01:41:42,167 --> 01:41:44,209
Do you have a belt for Sharic?

1818
01:41:44,417 --> 01:41:45,751
I'll check...

1819
01:41:48,251 --> 01:41:49,251
Hi!

1820
01:41:52,667 --> 01:41:54,292
You were calling earlier...

1821
01:41:56,501 --> 01:41:59,501
No! Why would you say that?

1822
01:42:03,459 --> 01:42:06,084
Nothing, just
having a bit of a rough day...

1823
01:42:12,667 --> 01:42:13,667
Thanks...

1824
01:42:16,834 --> 01:42:17,792
What's wrong, Ma?

1825
01:42:19,042 --> 01:42:20,709
You're hiding something from me.

1826
01:42:24,126 --> 01:42:25,876
Listen, I'll just call you back.

1827
01:42:29,209 --> 01:42:30,334
What are you hiding?

1828
01:42:33,084 --> 01:42:34,834
Do you know where Dad is?

1829
01:42:35,042 --> 01:42:36,417
Don't change the topic!

1830
01:42:36,792 --> 01:42:38,126
Answer me!

1831
01:42:39,459 --> 01:42:43,292
Whose photographs are on your laptop?

1832
01:42:44,751 --> 01:42:46,959
What? I don't know
what you're talking about.

1833
01:42:47,417 --> 01:42:49,334
They're definitely
not your girlfriend's.

1834
01:42:53,251 --> 01:42:54,959
Why were you looking at my laptop?

1835
01:42:55,334 --> 01:42:57,001
Move, Geishu.

1836
01:42:58,459 --> 01:42:59,626
Do you even have a girlfriend?

1837
01:42:59,709 --> 01:43:00,709
- Move, Geishu!

1838
01:43:01,126 --> 01:43:02,459
I want a name.

1839
01:43:02,584 --> 01:43:05,167
- Tell me the name!
- None of your business!

1840
01:43:05,667 --> 01:43:07,917
Rahul, don't lie to me.

1841
01:43:09,459 --> 01:43:13,167
Those photographs...
This is a misunderstanding, right?

1842
01:43:14,334 --> 01:43:15,792
- I don't have time for this.
- Rahul!

1843
01:43:18,459 --> 01:43:19,584
Ma, don't!

1844
01:43:22,417 --> 01:43:23,792
This is your girlfriend?!

1845
01:43:25,209 --> 01:43:26,167
This!

1846
01:43:26,667 --> 01:43:27,667
Disgusting!

1847
01:43:28,792 --> 01:43:30,292
Do you feel no shame?!

1848
01:43:30,751 --> 01:43:32,667
When did these lies start?

1849
01:43:34,042 --> 01:43:36,667
Did you think about us even once?!

1850
01:43:37,001 --> 01:43:38,417
About Dadu, about Dad...

1851
01:43:38,501 --> 01:43:40,167
Think about Dad?!

1852
01:43:41,959 --> 01:43:44,042
Dad told you he's
at the garage, right?

1853
01:43:44,417 --> 01:43:47,209
No one's a saint in
this house... Everybody lies!

1854
01:43:47,417 --> 01:43:49,084
So instead of finding faults with me...

1855
01:43:49,167 --> 01:43:50,334
save your own bloody marriage!

1856
01:43:50,417 --> 01:43:51,459
Shut up!

1857
01:43:54,917 --> 01:43:56,542
Rahul, the belt...

1858
01:43:58,001 --> 01:43:59,667
- All okay?
- Yeah, it's fine...

1859
01:43:59,834 --> 01:44:02,417
I'll just get it.
You go, I'll bring it...

1860
01:44:03,459 --> 01:44:05,751
- Okay... Ready... and smile!

1861
01:44:06,626 --> 01:44:07,251
- Got it!

1862
01:44:07,667 --> 01:44:09,376
- Now... take a picture of me
as I pretend to be dead.

1863
01:44:09,459 --> 01:44:10,584
Like this.

1864
01:44:11,667 --> 01:44:12,709
Wait!

1865
01:44:14,417 --> 01:44:15,876
- Ready.
- I'll click?

1866
01:44:16,084 --> 01:44:17,459
Got it. You look
very cute, Dadu.

1867
01:44:17,542 --> 01:44:19,667
If my Grandma was alive,
I'd totally set you two up.

1868
01:44:19,792 --> 01:44:21,792
- Really?
- What about your mum?

1869
01:44:23,167 --> 01:44:24,542
- Harsh!
- Yes?

1870
01:44:25,251 --> 01:44:27,459
- Tell everyone to hurry up!
- Okay...

1871
01:44:27,542 --> 01:44:30,084
- It'll get too overcast
to take the picture!

1872
01:44:40,126 --> 01:44:41,959
You said you were at the garage.

1873
01:44:43,751 --> 01:44:45,209
Rahul, I...

1874
01:44:46,709 --> 01:44:48,459
You're a disgusting person, Dad.

1875
01:44:51,042 --> 01:44:53,667
I was the one who
took a stand for you.

1876
01:44:55,876 --> 01:44:57,084
I'm sorry...

1877
01:44:58,251 --> 01:44:59,459
You're sorry?!

1878
01:45:01,876 --> 01:45:03,959
It's not what you think, Rahul...

1879
01:45:07,334 --> 01:45:09,126
Let me explain...

1880
01:45:10,876 --> 01:45:12,167
Forget it...

1881
01:45:14,542 --> 01:45:17,792
- It's going to rain.
- What's taking so long?!

1882
01:45:17,959 --> 01:45:20,459
- Go and call everyone!
- Come on, come on!

1883
01:45:20,542 --> 01:45:22,292
Where's Arjun? Call him!

1884
01:45:22,501 --> 01:45:23,792
Where were you?

1885
01:45:27,876 --> 01:45:29,209
There you'll are!

1886
01:45:29,292 --> 01:45:31,209
- Everyone's calling you'll!
- Corning...

1887
01:45:31,417 --> 01:45:34,001
- Aunty! Come!

1888
01:45:34,376 --> 01:45:35,876
- Arjun's not answering
his bloody phone.

1889
01:45:35,959 --> 01:45:38,417
- It's started drizzling!
- Aunty, sit here!

1890
01:45:38,501 --> 01:45:39,459
Okay...

1891
01:45:40,292 --> 01:45:42,542
- Quickly now! Fast!

1892
01:45:48,167 --> 01:45:51,084
- Sit there, baby.

1893
01:45:51,251 --> 01:45:54,251
- Sit there or she won't be seen.
- No no no! Not you!

1894
01:45:54,417 --> 01:45:56,042
Sit now. Come on...

1895
01:45:57,167 --> 01:45:58,959
Rahul, closer to your Mum.

1896
01:45:59,834 --> 01:46:01,376
- Show some love, guys!

1897
01:46:01,542 --> 01:46:03,001
- Okay, everyone ready?

1898
01:46:03,126 --> 01:46:04,417
Wait, where's Arjun?

1899
01:46:04,501 --> 01:46:06,376
- Where's Arjun?
- Arjun?

1900
01:46:06,542 --> 01:46:09,209
There you are!
Did you forget about the picture?

1901
01:46:09,292 --> 01:46:11,126
- Come on, Arjun!

1902
01:46:11,292 --> 01:46:12,917
- We were worried you had
gone back to America.

1903
01:46:13,001 --> 01:46:14,334
There! Next to Rahul!

1904
01:46:15,084 --> 01:46:16,959
- Next to Rahul!
- Come on!

1905
01:46:17,251 --> 01:46:20,292
- Hurry up now, it'll rain...

1906
01:46:22,084 --> 01:46:23,834
- Where were you, Arjun?

1907
01:46:24,167 --> 01:46:27,084
What are you planning
with all that space?

1908
01:46:27,251 --> 01:46:29,584
- Come closer!

1909
01:46:30,334 --> 01:46:31,292
Okay!

1910
01:46:31,459 --> 01:46:32,709
Why is only Dadu smiling?

1911
01:46:32,834 --> 01:46:34,667
Happy family photo!

1912
01:46:36,417 --> 01:46:39,084
Uncle! Put your arm around aunty!

1913
01:46:39,167 --> 01:46:41,667
- Like she's your wife!
- They're acting like neighbours...

1914
01:46:41,751 --> 01:46:44,542
The neighbor’s wife is way hotter.

1915
01:46:45,417 --> 01:46:47,001
Okay, focus!

1916
01:46:48,167 --> 01:46:49,292
What's wrong?

1917
01:46:49,459 --> 01:46:51,709
- Change the battery, you idiot!
- Oh, man...

1918
01:46:52,251 --> 01:46:54,167
- He's your friend, right?
- I want to go to the loo!

1919
01:46:54,292 --> 01:46:56,709
- No no!
- 2 minutes!

1920
01:46:56,876 --> 01:46:58,834
He should check the
battery beforehand...

1921
01:46:59,001 --> 01:47:01,667
- What are we waiting for?

1922
01:47:02,209 --> 01:47:03,834
Were you at Anu's?

1923
01:47:05,126 --> 01:47:07,001
We'll talk about this later...

1924
01:47:07,542 --> 01:47:08,626
- Camera ready!

1925
01:47:08,834 --> 01:47:11,417
- Where's Zoey?

1926
01:47:11,584 --> 01:47:12,584
What's wrong with you?

1927
01:47:12,709 --> 01:47:14,292
- Zoey, come back!
- Nothing.

1928
01:47:15,251 --> 01:47:16,459
Then why do you look so irritable?

1929
01:47:16,542 --> 01:47:18,376
Because you're the
scum of this earth.

1930
01:47:18,459 --> 01:47:20,459
- Okay, camera ready!

1931
01:47:23,251 --> 01:47:25,501
- Okay, ready! Smile!

1932
01:47:25,667 --> 01:47:27,001
Uncle, put your arm around Aunty!

1933
01:47:27,084 --> 01:47:30,001
- Come, come...
- Smile everyone!

1934
01:47:30,209 --> 01:47:31,167
- And...

1935
01:47:32,501 --> 01:47:33,501
Ready!

1936
01:47:34,084 --> 01:47:35,792
I've had enough.

1937
01:47:36,042 --> 01:47:37,459
- Sunita...
- Where's Aunty going?

1938
01:47:37,542 --> 01:47:39,751
- Sunita, I was joking!

1939
01:47:39,959 --> 01:47:42,084
I don't want any part
in this 'happy family' sham.

1940
01:47:42,167 --> 01:47:44,917
Everyone's waiting!
I'll tell you everything! Please!

1941
01:47:46,792 --> 01:47:48,209
- Tell me one thing...

1942
01:47:48,459 --> 01:47:50,584
Were you or were you not at Anu's?

1943
01:47:52,334 --> 01:47:53,292
I was.

1944
01:47:54,584 --> 01:47:55,501
Sunita...

1945
01:47:56,584 --> 01:47:59,459
Sunita... listen.
I went to end it.

1946
01:47:59,876 --> 01:48:02,251
I'll never go back again.

1947
01:48:02,667 --> 01:48:04,917
When did all this start?

1948
01:48:05,834 --> 01:48:06,792
One year...

1949
01:48:06,959 --> 01:48:09,126
- One year?!
- How does it matter now?

1950
01:48:12,709 --> 01:48:13,876
Liars...

1951
01:48:14,167 --> 01:48:16,459
Both of you! Liars!

1952
01:48:17,501 --> 01:48:18,959
Happy now?

1953
01:48:19,126 --> 01:48:21,334
Satisfied? Isn't this what you wanted?

1954
01:48:21,459 --> 01:48:25,501
Why is he packing?! Stop packing!
Harsh! Harsh!

1955
01:48:25,751 --> 01:48:27,542
- They're all going...
- We can do it later!

1956
01:48:27,751 --> 01:48:29,126
- Let's do this tomorrow...
- Okay, tomorrow.

1957
01:48:29,209 --> 01:48:29,959
- Dadu!

1958
01:48:30,042 --> 01:48:32,209
Arjun... take the kids to a hotel.

1959
01:48:32,292 --> 01:48:33,792
What are you hiding this time?

1960
01:48:34,459 --> 01:48:36,709
- What are you talking about?
- Really?

1961
01:48:36,792 --> 01:48:38,459
I have no idea what
you're talking about!

1962
01:48:38,584 --> 01:48:40,376
So you didn't kiss Tia?

1963
01:48:42,917 --> 01:48:44,292
Why didn't you tell me?

1964
01:48:44,459 --> 01:48:45,334
Look, Arjun...

1965
01:48:45,459 --> 01:48:48,459
Frankly speaking,
I have no time for your love life.

1966
01:48:48,584 --> 01:48:50,751
If you think this is the
best time to talk about this...

1967
01:48:50,917 --> 01:48:53,501
- You can go sulk in some corner!
- Screw this photo!

1968
01:48:53,667 --> 01:48:56,126
- What happened?
- What's going on?

1969
01:48:56,376 --> 01:48:59,417
- Neetu, take the kids and go.
- Nothing's wrong, Dadu.

1970
01:49:02,001 --> 01:49:04,542
- Dad, you'll get wet!

1971
01:49:04,626 --> 01:49:06,834
Go. Please go to Anu's house.

1972
01:49:07,209 --> 01:49:08,251
That's what's best.

1973
01:49:09,126 --> 01:49:10,626
I'm apologizing to you.

1974
01:49:11,167 --> 01:49:13,209
I made a mistake.
I'm only human!

1975
01:49:13,542 --> 01:49:14,584
Sunita...

1976
01:49:26,501 --> 01:49:27,459
Dad!

1977
01:49:28,001 --> 01:49:29,084
Dad!

1978
01:49:50,251 --> 01:49:52,209
What's happening, Rahul?
ls everything okay?

1979
01:49:52,292 --> 01:49:53,834
Everything's fine, Uncle.
Please just handle everyone.

1980
01:49:53,917 --> 01:49:55,334
- Are you sure-
- Yes, I'm sure!

1981
01:49:55,417 --> 01:49:56,834
Please! I'll handle it.

1982
01:49:57,001 --> 01:49:58,459
- Ma...
- Neetu!

1983
01:49:59,417 --> 01:50:00,501
- Shashi!

1984
01:50:01,292 --> 01:50:02,959
- I'm coming, Dad!

1985
01:50:09,917 --> 01:50:11,376
I'll talk to him!

1986
01:50:11,501 --> 01:50:13,376
Dad... Everything's okay.

1987
01:50:13,459 --> 01:50:15,959
What nonsense!
They're all fighting outside!

1988
01:50:16,126 --> 01:50:17,667
I'm here to take care of it!

1989
01:50:24,376 --> 01:50:25,417
Ma...

1990
01:50:25,751 --> 01:50:28,209
I'm sorry for what I said before.

1991
01:50:29,417 --> 01:50:31,292
I didn't mean to hurt anyone.

1992
01:50:31,376 --> 01:50:32,584
Go away, Rahul...

1993
01:50:34,876 --> 01:50:38,667
You lied to me... I don't
want to hear any more...

1994
01:50:39,334 --> 01:50:42,501
Ma... Is it the lies that hurt you...
or the truth?

1995
01:50:42,667 --> 01:50:45,584
You and I have no connection now.

1996
01:50:46,709 --> 01:50:48,792
You're no one to me.

1997
01:50:50,126 --> 01:50:52,126
Ma... Please... Just listen to me.

1998
01:50:52,334 --> 01:50:53,792
Please... <i>2</i> minutes...

1999
01:50:53,959 --> 01:50:55,834
I know I lied.

2000
01:50:56,376 --> 01:50:57,751
I kept a lot of secrets...

2001
01:50:57,834 --> 01:51:01,834
I hurt you and I can
apologize for it all...

2002
01:51:02,292 --> 01:51:05,334
But how do I apologize
for who I really am?

2003
01:51:06,209 --> 01:51:09,376
Rahul... my perfect son...

2004
01:51:09,584 --> 01:51:12,917
Morn, I'm tired of being perfect.

2005
01:51:13,501 --> 01:51:14,709
Please...

2006
01:51:16,084 --> 01:51:17,626
I don't want any of this...

2007
01:51:17,959 --> 01:51:21,292
I'm tired of running...
from myself... from you.

2008
01:51:21,501 --> 01:51:23,542
I'm tired of being afraid
of what people will say.

2009
01:51:24,459 --> 01:51:26,334
I am what I am, Ma...

2010
01:51:26,501 --> 01:51:29,417
and I just want you
to love me for who I am.

2011
01:51:32,251 --> 01:51:34,376
Where did I go so wrong...

2012
01:51:36,751 --> 01:51:40,417
- that everyone...
you, Arjun, your father...

2013
01:51:40,626 --> 01:51:42,709
. everyone's pushed me away.

2014
01:51:43,167 --> 01:51:46,751
- God will never forgive me...
- Please, Ma...

2015
01:51:47,001 --> 01:51:50,001
Go away, Rahul!
You've really hurt me!

2016
01:52:15,251 --> 01:52:16,959
Whatever I am today,
is because of you.

2017
01:52:17,042 --> 01:52:19,542
My book, my career... it's all you.

2018
01:52:21,542 --> 01:52:23,417
I've done something terrible, Rahul...

2019
01:52:25,459 --> 01:52:26,542
Rahul...

2020
01:52:28,292 --> 01:52:30,417
- Your book...
- Rahul!

2021
01:52:30,501 --> 01:52:33,959
The story that-

2022
01:52:34,792 --> 01:52:35,834
- Bloody thief!

2023
01:52:37,584 --> 01:52:39,876
Stealing once wasn't enough for you?!

2024
01:52:40,084 --> 01:52:41,209
- Shashi!

2025
01:52:41,417 --> 01:52:42,251
- Shashi!

2026
01:52:42,876 --> 01:52:44,501
- Shashi come quick!

2027
01:52:46,459 --> 01:52:48,792
I was trying to help you...

2028
01:52:50,542 --> 01:52:51,376
- Liar!

2029
01:52:51,417 --> 01:52:53,084
Why do you think your agent's
been trying to get in touch?!

2030
01:52:53,167 --> 01:52:54,584
Ma, he was stealing again!
You know it!

2031
01:52:54,667 --> 01:52:56,792
No! No!
It's not his fault!

2032
01:52:56,876 --> 01:52:59,376
I was the one who gave him your story!

2033
01:53:27,251 --> 01:53:31,501
Rahul had been trying
to write for ages...

2034
01:53:32,876 --> 01:53:35,209
- He was stuck...
- What about me, Ma?!

2035
01:53:35,376 --> 01:53:39,751
Arjun... I thought you weren't
serious about anything...

2036
01:53:40,751 --> 01:53:42,501
You quit college in 6 months...

2037
01:53:43,167 --> 01:53:46,501
Then adventure sports, photography...

2038
01:53:47,334 --> 01:53:48,751
You had abandoned that book too?
Hadn't you?

2039
01:53:48,834 --> 01:53:51,001
So you gave my story to Rahul!

2040
01:53:51,084 --> 01:53:52,251
I just thought...

2041
01:53:52,334 --> 01:53:55,792
Thought what, Ma?!
Like you ever think about me!

2042
01:53:56,834 --> 01:53:59,667
Do you know why I'm always
taking up new things?!

2043
01:54:00,376 --> 01:54:02,334
I wanted to prove myself!

2044
01:54:02,417 --> 01:54:05,542
I wanted to do something
to make you feel proud!

2045
01:54:06,167 --> 01:54:08,626
And today,
you've snatched that from me!

2046
01:54:09,126 --> 01:54:10,251
I'm sorry...

2047
01:54:11,584 --> 01:54:13,709
I should never have
given him your story...

2048
01:54:13,876 --> 01:54:17,334
Morn, this isn't about
the goddamn story!

2049
01:54:17,667 --> 01:54:20,417
It's about you and me!! It's about what
you made me feel all these years...

2050
01:54:20,459 --> 01:54:22,126
...that I'm just not good enough.

2051
01:54:22,292 --> 01:54:23,417
No, my darling...

2052
01:54:23,501 --> 01:54:25,167
Rahul was always better than me!

2053
01:54:25,417 --> 01:54:28,001
- I'm sorry...
- Sorry?!

2054
01:54:29,334 --> 01:54:32,334
Sorry won't fix this, Ma...
Sorry won't fix anything.

2055
01:54:32,417 --> 01:54:33,667
Arjun, no!

2056
01:54:33,751 --> 01:54:35,834
Arjun! Listen, please!

2057
01:58:36,417 --> 01:58:39,042
Arjun sir... Your bags are packed.

2058
01:58:39,209 --> 01:58:41,542
The taxi will be here at 5 am.

2059
01:58:46,584 --> 01:58:48,417
I'm not hungry...

2060
01:58:50,001 --> 01:58:51,542
You'll eat...

2061
01:58:56,959 --> 01:58:58,334
Arjun, please...

2062
01:59:00,209 --> 01:59:02,042
Stay back a few days...

2063
01:59:03,792 --> 01:59:05,751
Morn needs us.

2064
01:59:07,834 --> 01:59:10,751
She doesn't need us... she needs you.

2065
01:59:17,834 --> 01:59:20,042
She's not even speaking to me.

2066
01:59:24,251 --> 01:59:25,959
Who knows if she ever will.

2067
01:59:26,209 --> 01:59:30,626
Please, Rahul... There's nothing
you can do to make Morn that angry.

2068
01:59:34,876 --> 01:59:36,167
If only.

2069
01:59:40,334 --> 01:59:44,792
Arjun... There's something
I've been lying about my entire life.

2070
01:59:46,667 --> 01:59:48,917
I don't have a girlfriend in London.

2071
01:59:54,751 --> 01:59:59,417
As for Tia... or Geet...
or any girl for that matter...

2072
01:59:59,626 --> 02:00:02,834
I've never been interested...

2073
02:00:04,001 --> 02:00:05,542
...and never will be.

2074
02:00:09,792 --> 02:00:13,459
My whole life has been a lie... and...

2075
02:00:15,876 --> 02:00:19,334
No one in this house
will ever accept the truth.

2076
02:00:27,917 --> 02:00:29,959
I... I don't know what to say.

2077
02:00:31,959 --> 02:00:33,334
It's alright.

2078
02:00:33,667 --> 02:00:35,709
You don't have to say anything.

2079
02:00:38,751 --> 02:00:42,792
All I'm asking is that
you stay back for a while.

2080
02:00:48,876 --> 02:00:50,501
That's something I can't do!

2081
02:00:56,292 --> 02:00:58,209
I... I need some time.

2082
02:01:28,667 --> 02:01:30,001
- So has he read the new draft?

2083
02:01:30,167 --> 02:01:32,042
He's been expecting you!

2084
02:01:35,542 --> 02:01:36,626
Thank you.

2085
02:01:36,959 --> 02:01:38,584
- Hey, Arjun... Edward.
- Hi.

2086
02:01:38,709 --> 02:01:39,792
Have a seat.

2087
02:01:40,501 --> 02:01:42,459
So. Loved the new draft.

2088
02:01:43,501 --> 02:01:45,917
Congratulations.
We're going ahead with it.

2089
02:01:48,334 --> 02:01:49,292
Thank you.

2090
02:01:50,459 --> 02:01:52,167
The new ending's great!

2091
02:01:52,334 --> 02:01:54,251
What made you decide to change it?

2092
02:01:56,876 --> 02:01:59,001
Just a good suggestion from someone.

2093
02:03:02,209 --> 02:03:03,501
Hello, kids...

2094
02:03:03,584 --> 02:03:04,792
How are you?

2095
02:03:05,084 --> 02:03:06,334
- I'm fine.

2096
02:03:07,042 --> 02:03:08,876
It's just that...

2097
02:03:09,667 --> 02:03:13,459
I got tired of watching
Mandakini's videos.

2098
02:03:13,584 --> 02:03:15,917
So I thought I'd talk to you guys...

2099
02:03:18,417 --> 02:03:20,751
I really miss you both.

2100
02:03:22,334 --> 02:03:24,084
After Harsh...

2101
02:03:25,126 --> 02:03:27,251
- It's difficult to
find the will to live.

2102
02:03:28,667 --> 02:03:31,917
Otherwise I was all
set for my century...

2103
02:03:32,917 --> 02:03:34,917
Now it's too hard...

2104
02:03:35,667 --> 02:03:37,667
I feel very alone...

2105
02:03:39,334 --> 02:03:42,126
Sometimes I look at
your father's pictures and...

2106
02:03:54,626 --> 02:03:58,376
You'll should call
your mother sometimes...

2107
02:03:58,917 --> 02:04:03,834
She acts like she's very strong...

2108
02:04:05,167 --> 02:04:08,876
But I hear her crying every night.

2109
02:04:10,126 --> 02:04:11,542
- Every night.

2110
02:04:12,667 --> 02:04:18,459
I'm asking you'll for
the one thing I don't have...

2111
02:04:19,459 --> 02:04:21,959
Just a little... Time.

2112
02:04:23,251 --> 02:04:25,667
Everyone makes mistakes, kids...

2113
02:04:26,459 --> 02:04:29,292
- But we don't abandon our families.

2114
02:04:30,834 --> 02:04:32,709
Consider this an old man's request...

2115
02:04:32,792 --> 02:04:36,584
Once... just once... Come back.

2116
02:04:37,126 --> 02:04:41,001
After that... who knows
if you'll need to.

2117
02:04:44,542 --> 02:04:45,376
<i>Bye..bye...</i>

2118
02:05:10,876 --> 02:05:12,084
- Hi Shashi Uncle...

2119
02:05:12,334 --> 02:05:13,501
Hi Zoey!

2120
02:05:13,709 --> 02:05:14,709
- Flight was okay?
- Hi...

2121
02:05:14,792 --> 02:05:16,792
- How are you?
- Good, good...

2122
02:05:27,959 --> 02:05:29,334
Come with me!

2123
02:05:29,542 --> 02:05:31,584
- See my new book!
- Hi, Ma.

2124
02:05:38,834 --> 02:05:40,126
Thank you...

2125
02:05:40,709 --> 02:05:42,126
Thank you for coming...

2126
02:05:42,501 --> 02:05:45,001
- Hi, Dadu...
- I'm so happy to see you'll...

2127
02:05:46,167 --> 02:05:49,209
- You rest, Dadu...
- We'll see you in the morning.

2128
02:05:49,417 --> 02:05:51,376
Do me a favour...

2129
02:05:52,667 --> 02:05:55,001
Another small request...

2130
02:05:55,542 --> 02:05:59,959
Bring the whole family to me tomorrow...

2131
02:06:05,001 --> 02:06:06,792
God bless you both...

2132
02:06:16,042 --> 02:06:17,167
Rahul?

2133
02:06:17,417 --> 02:06:18,667
Come in, Ma...

2134
02:06:19,542 --> 02:06:21,292
Just dropping these off...

2135
02:06:22,709 --> 02:06:25,001
Dharmendra forgot to keep them...

2136
02:06:35,417 --> 02:06:36,459
I'll get you a glass...

2137
02:06:36,542 --> 02:06:38,001
<i>-</i> Ma?
<i>-</i> Yes?

2138
02:06:40,709 --> 02:06:41,792
Sit with me...

2139
02:06:59,876 --> 02:07:01,209
How are you?

2140
02:07:02,417 --> 02:07:03,709
I'm fine...

2141
02:07:05,209 --> 02:07:06,292
Busy...

2142
02:07:07,959 --> 02:07:09,042
I'm fine.

2143
02:07:13,959 --> 02:07:15,042
Are you okay?

2144
02:07:15,126 --> 02:07:17,459
Yes... I'm fine.

2145
02:07:19,709 --> 02:07:21,792
And... How's...

2146
02:07:26,709 --> 02:07:29,501
Your... friend?

2147
02:07:42,459 --> 02:07:43,626
It's okay.

2148
02:07:45,376 --> 02:07:47,084
I missed you.

2149
02:07:47,792 --> 02:07:49,084
I'm sorry.

2150
02:07:56,626 --> 02:07:58,251
I didn't think you'd come.

2151
02:07:59,459 --> 02:08:01,209
I didn't think you'd call.

2152
02:08:05,334 --> 02:08:09,334
You know, Tia... When you
told me about your family...

2153
02:08:12,292 --> 02:08:14,334
I could understand your pain...

2154
02:08:17,376 --> 02:08:18,917
But now... I can feel it.

2155
02:08:20,334 --> 02:08:21,792
I know how you feel, Arjun.

2156
02:08:31,792 --> 02:08:34,292
I'm tired of running away...
that's all I've ever done.

2157
02:08:34,626 --> 02:08:35,876
Then come back...

2158
02:08:38,251 --> 02:08:39,917
Everyone's here...

2159
02:08:40,626 --> 02:08:42,084
They always were.

2160
02:08:47,876 --> 02:08:49,209
I missed you.
