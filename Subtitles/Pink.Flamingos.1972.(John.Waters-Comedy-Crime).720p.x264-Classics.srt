00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:51,239
Hello, moviegoers. This is Mr. Jay
speaking to you for Dreamland Studios.

2
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,960
This beautiful mobile home
you see before you...

3
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,476
...is the current hideout
of the notorious beauty Divine...

4
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,313
...the filthiest person alive.

5
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,633
Because of this cover story in one
of your sleazier national tabloids...

6
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:06,154
...she has been forced
to go underground...

7
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,313
...disguising he! appearance
and adopting the alias of Babs Johnson.

8
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:13,392
With he! live he! trusted
traveling companion, Cotton...

9
00:03:13,559 --> 00:03:17,234
...her delinquent son, Crackers,
and her mentally-ill mother, Miss Edie.

10
00:03:17,399 --> 00:03:19,549
Let's take a peek inside.

11
00:03:21,119 --> 00:03:25,352
It's 10:30. Babs. Babs.
Why isn't the Egg Man here?

12
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,874
I'm starving to death for some eggs.

13
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:31,633
Please, Babs, come in
and give me some eggs.

14
00:03:32,438 --> 00:03:36,511
I'm coming, Mama. I'm coming.
You can hold on.

15
00:03:36,678 --> 00:03:40,228
Cotton, Cotton.
Babs won't give me my eggs.

16
00:03:40,398 --> 00:03:44,187
Cotton, please come in here
and give me my eggs.

17
00:03:44,358 --> 00:03:46,269
Be in in a minute, Edie.
Don't you worry.

18
00:03:46,438 --> 00:03:48,554
I'll fry you up some, honey.

19
00:03:49,278 --> 00:03:52,475
Eggs. Eggs. Eggs.

20
00:03:56,398 --> 00:04:00,277
Good morning, Mama.
I bet you're hungry.

21
00:04:00,437 --> 00:04:04,908
Oh, Babs, I'm starving to death.
Hasn't that Egg Man come yet?

22
00:04:05,077 --> 00:04:07,353
I love that Egg Man so much.

23
00:04:07,517 --> 00:04:10,828
No, he hasn't come yet, Mama,
but we still have some eggs.

24
00:04:10,997 --> 00:04:12,351
I'll put some on for you.

25
00:04:12,517 --> 00:04:16,829
- Did you sleep well?
- Oh, Babs, I slept so well.

26
00:04:16,997 --> 00:04:19,716
Where did you get this train?

27
00:04:19,877 --> 00:04:22,630
Did you sleep
in the caboose last night?

28
00:04:22,797 --> 00:04:26,756
- How did you know I love trains?
- Oh, it's not a train, Mama.

29
00:04:26,917 --> 00:04:30,466
It's our new mobile home,
and I sleep in the other room.

30
00:04:30,636 --> 00:04:35,187
We all have our own rooms this time.
Me, you and Cotton.

31
00:04:35,356 --> 00:04:38,155
And Crackers has that nice little shed
right out back...

32
00:04:38,316 --> 00:04:41,946
...so he can have his friends in
whenever he likes without waking us up.

33
00:04:42,116 --> 00:04:43,470
Isn't it wonderful?

34
00:04:43,636 --> 00:04:49,348
Now, you just sit tight and I'll fry you up
some big grade-A treats.

35
00:04:50,236 --> 00:04:53,911
- Over light today, Mama?
- Oh, no, Babs, no.

36
00:04:54,076 --> 00:04:57,990
It's sunny out today.
I want them sunny-side up.

37
00:04:58,156 --> 00:05:00,795
You know howl like them, Babs.
You know howl like them.

38
00:05:00,955 --> 00:05:03,549
I know how you like them, Mama.
I'll be right back.

39
00:05:04,075 --> 00:05:07,147
Across town,
located in the teeming metropolis...

40
00:05:07,315 --> 00:05:09,067
...known as downtown Baltimore.

41
00:05:09,235 --> 00:05:13,547
...live Connie and Raymond Marble,
two jealous perverts...

42
00:05:13,715 --> 00:05:18,186
...that hate Divine's fame and notoriety
more than anything in the whole world.

43
00:05:18,355 --> 00:05:23,270
For Connie and Raymond Marble,
it was the beginning of the end.

44
00:05:24,595 --> 00:05:28,474
Well, Miss Sandstone,
after looking over your qualifications...

45
00:05:28,634 --> 00:05:31,353
...my husband and I have decided
that you're not exactly...

46
00:05:31,514 --> 00:05:33,346
...what we had in mind for the job.

47
00:05:33,514 --> 00:05:37,109
Not only have you never heard of Divine,
which is one of the key elements...

48
00:05:37,274 --> 00:05:38,787
...for this particular job...

49
00:05:38,954 --> 00:05:42,584
...but you also seem to show
a lack of general experience.

50
00:05:42,754 --> 00:05:45,951
And to be honest,
we feel you're sort of a dullard.

51
00:05:46,114 --> 00:05:48,583
Well, why do you say that?
I did everything you asked.

52
00:05:48,754 --> 00:05:50,586
I even found out who this Divine was.

53
00:05:50,754 --> 00:05:54,543
Too late. Too late. And naturally,
you did everything I asked, my dear.

54
00:05:54,714 --> 00:05:58,263
You would never have gotten
to this plateau of the job placement test.

55
00:05:58,433 --> 00:06:00,663
I mean, surely you can see our point.

56
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:03,905
We're not in a position
to just take anyone.

57
00:06:04,073 --> 00:06:07,270
This is a high-security job,
as you can well imagine...

58
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:09,344
...and we personally just don't feel...

59
00:06:09,513 --> 00:06:12,585
...that you meet our...
Oh, how should I say?

60
00:06:12,753 --> 00:06:16,872
Our admittedly sometimes stringent
screening process.

61
00:06:17,033 --> 00:06:18,910
Well, why did you hold me up
for so long?

62
00:06:19,073 --> 00:06:20,984
Why did you keep asking me
to come back?

63
00:06:21,153 --> 00:06:23,030
I had another job I could've taken.

64
00:06:23,193 --> 00:06:26,265
How could I have gotten information
about this Divine you talk of?

65
00:06:26,432 --> 00:06:28,821
I don't know her.
You could've given me some lead...

66
00:06:28,992 --> 00:06:31,506
...as to how I could've gathered
this data you wanted.

67
00:06:31,672 --> 00:06:33,629
You led me to believe I had this job.

68
00:06:33,792 --> 00:06:36,784
Well, Miss Sandstone, Miss, uh...

69
00:06:36,952 --> 00:06:38,863
"Sandy Sandstone."

70
00:06:39,032 --> 00:06:42,707
You just must've been wrong
in your assumptions, weren't you?

71
00:06:42,872 --> 00:06:45,022
I mean, surely
you've heard the expression...

72
00:06:45,192 --> 00:06:48,264
...don't count your chickens.
Well, apply it.

73
00:06:48,432 --> 00:06:51,185
I never gave you a final answer
on this whole thing...

74
00:06:51,352 --> 00:06:53,866
...and as far as you believing
that you had the job...

75
00:06:54,032 --> 00:06:57,228
...well, I've never even considered
that you would be the applicant...

76
00:06:57,391 --> 00:07:00,190
...that we would choose.
You don't know enough.

77
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:04,310
I mean, I wish everyone was like you
and had never heard of Divine...

78
00:07:04,471 --> 00:07:07,543
...but unfortunately,
it just isn't like that.

79
00:07:07,711 --> 00:07:10,464
Now, if you wouldn't mind,
I do have a busy day ahead of me.

80
00:07:10,631 --> 00:07:12,190
There's nothing left to discuss.

81
00:07:12,351 --> 00:07:15,343
Well, what am I supposed to do now?
That's what I'd like to know.

82
00:07:15,511 --> 00:07:18,742
You can eat shit for all I care,
Miss Sandstone...

83
00:07:18,911 --> 00:07:22,063
...or eat anything that you like
or do anything that you like.

84
00:07:22,231 --> 00:07:25,461
Just don't assume
that I want to know your troubles.

85
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:26,984
Now, if you wouldn't mind...

86
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:29,744
...I'm a busy woman
with a full day's work ahead of me.

87
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:32,299
Please remove yourself
from my office.

88
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:35,906
You're a real cunt, do you know that?
A real fucking cunt.

89
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:39,745
How can you be so shitty to people?
How can you stand yourself?

90
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:43,380
I guess there's just two kinds of people,
Miss Sandstone...

91
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:46,463
...my kind of people and assholes.

92
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:49,782
It's rather obvious
which category you fit into.

93
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:52,988
- Have a nice day.
- Eat the bird, bitch.

94
00:07:56,949 --> 00:07:59,782
You ready, Ma? You ready yet?

95
00:08:01,149 --> 00:08:04,028
I'm ready, darling. Just let me
say goodbye to Mama and Cotton.

96
00:08:04,189 --> 00:08:05,304
I'll be out in a minute.

97
00:08:05,469 --> 00:08:07,380
Okay, but get the lead out of your ass...

98
00:08:07,549 --> 00:08:09,540
...or I'll be late for my date.
All right.

99
00:08:09,709 --> 00:08:13,862
Yes, won't I be late for my date?
You are gonna love my date.

100
00:08:14,029 --> 00:08:15,702
You'll like her as much as I do.

101
00:08:15,869 --> 00:08:18,748
And I'm gonna bring her back real soon
for you all to enjoy.

102
00:08:20,389 --> 00:08:23,063
What do you mean,
Humpty Dumpty was an egg?

103
00:08:23,229 --> 00:08:27,461
How could a person be an egg, Cotton?
How could a person be an egg?

104
00:08:27,628 --> 00:08:31,906
Well, he had little legs and little arms
and he could walk and talk and all...

105
00:08:32,068 --> 00:08:33,297
...just like a person.

106
00:08:33,468 --> 00:08:37,507
Only he was an egg,
a little egg, all dressed up.

107
00:08:37,668 --> 00:08:41,298
Ha-ha-ha.
Tell it to me again, Cotton.

108
00:08:41,468 --> 00:08:44,824
You should be learning it by now, Edie.
Now, listen carefully.

109
00:08:44,988 --> 00:08:49,903
Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall
Humpty Dumpty had a great fall

110
00:08:50,068 --> 00:08:52,503
All the king's horses
And all the king's men

111
00:08:52,668 --> 00:08:54,943
Couldn't put Humpty together again

112
00:09:01,147 --> 00:09:03,343
Do you get it, Edie?
Do you understand?

113
00:09:03,507 --> 00:09:07,944
Tell me some more egg stories, Cotton.
Please tell me some more stories.

114
00:09:08,107 --> 00:09:10,781
I'm on my way.

115
00:09:11,427 --> 00:09:14,385
You sure are dressed up, Babs.
You look real pretty.

116
00:09:14,547 --> 00:09:15,821
Oh, thank you, Cotton.

117
00:09:15,987 --> 00:09:17,341
Why, a girl can never tell...

118
00:09:17,507 --> 00:09:19,703
...who she might run into
when she's downtown.

119
00:09:19,867 --> 00:09:23,097
Why, I'm all dressed up
and ready to fall in love.

120
00:09:23,266 --> 00:09:25,098
I kind of wish I was going out too...

121
00:09:25,266 --> 00:09:28,224
...but I think Crackers
is bringing his lady friend out here...

122
00:09:28,386 --> 00:09:31,344
...and I don't wanna miss that.
It's usually a pretty good show.

123
00:09:31,506 --> 00:09:33,702
I know. You can go into town
next time I go.

124
00:09:33,866 --> 00:09:35,618
It's just those errands I have to run.

125
00:09:35,786 --> 00:09:39,256
Besides, you and Crackers
will have a pretty good time right here.

126
00:09:39,426 --> 00:09:42,145
- That little shed's just perfect.
- I know it, Babs.

127
00:09:42,306 --> 00:09:46,265
It'll be the first time we've had anyone
out here. I can't wait to see how it works.

128
00:09:46,426 --> 00:09:48,497
I hope she doesn't give us
any trouble.

129
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:49,986
I wouldn't worry about that.

130
00:09:50,146 --> 00:09:52,421
Crackers has a pretty good eye
for what he likes.

131
00:09:52,585 --> 00:09:55,145
Just say a little prayer
that I find a little something.

132
00:09:55,305 --> 00:09:58,024
Why, I haven't fallen in love
for three whole days.

133
00:09:58,185 --> 00:10:01,974
I'm just itching to find somebody
with a little imagination.

134
00:10:02,145 --> 00:10:07,015
Bye-bye, Babs. Bye-bye, Babs.
Bye-bye, Babs. Bye-bye.

135
00:10:07,185 --> 00:10:09,256
Mother, you do not have
to raise your voice...

136
00:10:09,425 --> 00:10:13,134
...and you don't have to yell.
We're all right here. We can all hear you.

137
00:10:13,305 --> 00:10:14,340
Aw...

138
00:10:15,745 --> 00:10:17,304
I do have to yell.

139
00:10:17,465 --> 00:10:20,264
I'm starving to death
and that Egg Man ain't gonna come...

140
00:10:20,425 --> 00:10:21,745
...and I know it.

141
00:10:21,904 --> 00:10:25,295
You know he never comes
until later, Mother.

142
00:10:27,064 --> 00:10:30,056
- She'll be all right. Go on, Babs.
- All right.

143
00:10:30,224 --> 00:10:32,454
She'll be all right. Won't you, Mama?

144
00:10:32,624 --> 00:10:35,616
You want some hard-boiled eggs
to nibble on while you're waiting?

145
00:10:35,784 --> 00:10:38,936
- Yes.
- Yes, I bet you do.

146
00:10:39,104 --> 00:10:43,177
- Bye, Babs. Don't forget the party food.
Okay.

147
00:10:46,904 --> 00:10:49,623
Crackers, I'm ready.

148
00:10:49,784 --> 00:10:51,501
Let's go, Mama. I'm late for my date.

149
00:10:51,663 --> 00:10:54,701
Oh, but, honey, how will you ever
get back out here from downtown?

150
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:57,901
We'll hitch. It ain't hard.
Just let me off at the Etta Gown Shop.

151
00:10:58,063 --> 00:10:59,542
That's where I'm supposed
to meet the little lady.

152
00:10:59,703 --> 00:11:02,855
We'll get back somehow. I just hope
she's ready for a little action.

153
00:11:03,023 --> 00:11:04,502
Oh, honey, I know what you mean.

154
00:11:04,663 --> 00:11:07,542
Why, I wouldn't mind finding
a little action myself.

155
00:11:07,703 --> 00:11:09,933
You shouldn't have much trouble
with your date...

156
00:11:10,103 --> 00:11:12,299
...that is,
if she has anything on the ball.

157
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:15,421
Just hope she likes to experiment.
You know whatl mean?

158
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:18,894
A little sweet talking
goes along, long way.

159
00:11:19,063 --> 00:11:21,099
Give me your hand, honey.

160
00:12:57,659 --> 00:13:00,378
Channing. Channing!

161
00:13:06,699 --> 00:13:09,691
Jesus Christ.

162
00:13:12,619 --> 00:13:14,530
- Are they here yet?
- Yes, they've been waiting.

163
00:13:14,699 --> 00:13:17,088
Well, show them in.

164
00:13:22,658 --> 00:13:24,535
Mrs. Marble will see you now.

165
00:13:24,698 --> 00:13:27,417
- Come on, Merle, she's ready to see us.
I'm coming.

166
00:13:27,578 --> 00:13:29,251
- Hello.
- Hi, Miss Marble.

167
00:13:29,418 --> 00:13:31,978
We've been so excited
about this all week, me and Merle.

168
00:13:32,138 --> 00:13:34,937
We can hardly sleep
just waiting to see little Noodle's face.

169
00:13:35,098 --> 00:13:37,055
And, shit,
we usually sleep pretty good.

170
00:13:37,218 --> 00:13:39,971
Me and Etta's really
gonna have to settle down.

171
00:13:40,138 --> 00:13:42,414
It's gonna be a lot different
with a baby around.

172
00:13:42,578 --> 00:13:46,128
Yes, well, as I said, Mr. Marble
and I are about 90 percent certain...

173
00:13:46,298 --> 00:13:47,890
...that you will get Noodles...

174
00:13:48,057 --> 00:13:51,493
...but first have a seat so I can just
briefly recheck your application.

175
00:13:51,657 --> 00:13:54,126
Don't say anything, all right?
Just don't say a word.

176
00:13:54,297 --> 00:13:56,447
When are you going to get her
out of here?

177
00:13:56,617 --> 00:13:58,972
Come on, little Noodles,
you just found a new home.

178
00:13:59,137 --> 00:14:02,653
Oh, that's real nice.
Poor fucking Alice dies giving birth...

179
00:14:02,817 --> 00:14:04,808
...you can't even bother
to move the body...

180
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:07,173
...and now the bitch has sold the kid.

181
00:14:07,337 --> 00:14:08,372
Poor baby.

182
00:14:08,537 --> 00:14:12,371
And you, you little suckling,
can't even get me my tranquillizers.

183
00:14:12,537 --> 00:14:16,496
You shithead, where are my pills?
That bitch can afford it.

184
00:14:16,657 --> 00:14:19,250
She's got another couple grand
coming for this one.

185
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:21,976
Can't she at least give me
my fucking pills?

186
00:14:22,136 --> 00:14:24,730
I said don't talk to me
when I come down here.

187
00:14:24,896 --> 00:14:27,456
I don't give a fuck what you said,
you fucking pig.

188
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:30,449
Get this body out of here.
It's making me sick.

189
00:14:30,616 --> 00:14:34,325
When are they gonna get another one?
What poor girl will they get next?

190
00:14:34,496 --> 00:14:37,488
I know they're gonna get another one.
Just like when I came here.

191
00:14:37,656 --> 00:14:41,012
I replaced somebody, didn't I?
You fucking little dingleberry.

192
00:14:41,176 --> 00:14:43,645
That's what you're like,
you fucking ball of shit.

193
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:44,806
I said shut up.

194
00:14:44,976 --> 00:14:47,330
Shut up and don't talk to me
when I come down here.

195
00:14:48,735 --> 00:14:50,646
Oh, look how pretty she is.

196
00:14:50,815 --> 00:14:52,044
Aw...

197
00:14:52,215 --> 00:14:53,569
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

198
00:14:53,735 --> 00:14:57,330
- Connie, do they get this?
- Yes, they do, Chan.

199
00:14:57,495 --> 00:15:00,965
Look how pretty she is.
Oh, Merle, I'm so happy.

200
00:15:01,135 --> 00:15:05,174
And, baby, if you're happy, I'm happy,
because that's what I'm living for...

201
00:15:05,335 --> 00:15:08,407
...you, me, and now little Noodles.

202
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:11,852
Thank you, Miss Marble. Without you,
we never would've been this happy.

203
00:15:12,015 --> 00:15:14,245
You are a wonderful,
wonderful person.

204
00:15:14,415 --> 00:15:15,530
Thank you.

205
00:15:15,695 --> 00:15:16,809
Well, thank you, ladies.

206
00:15:16,974 --> 00:15:19,488
If it wasn't for you,
I wouldn't be in this business...

207
00:15:19,654 --> 00:15:22,533
...and that's all I care about
is satisfying my customers...

208
00:15:22,694 --> 00:15:26,210
...and making sure that the babies
are placed in good homes.

209
00:15:26,374 --> 00:15:27,364
Thank you.

210
00:15:27,534 --> 00:15:29,810
- Bye-bye, now.
Bye.

211
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:38,644
We'll see who's the filthiest person alive.
We'll just see!

212
00:19:41,445 --> 00:19:44,915
And where is that Raymond?
Where is he?

213
00:19:45,085 --> 00:19:46,519
How could he leave me alone..

214
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:49,643
When there's so much
to be taken care of?

215
00:19:49,965 --> 00:19:50,955
Oh...

216
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:56,074
Please come home, Raymond.
I need you so badly.

217
00:21:41,281 --> 00:21:44,114
Can you hurry, driver?
I'll be late for my appointment.

218
00:21:44,281 --> 00:21:48,036
I'm going as fast as I can, lady,
without breaking the law.

219
00:21:48,721 --> 00:21:50,553
Thirty-eight hundred Greenmount, right?

220
00:21:50,721 --> 00:21:53,520
That's what I said, wasn't it?

221
00:21:55,081 --> 00:21:58,870
- Two thirty.
- You can shove 2.30, hack.

222
00:22:01,321 --> 00:22:02,755
Hey!

223
00:22:05,521 --> 00:22:09,479
Why, hello, Cookie.
I do hope you're hungry.

224
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,551
I could go for a sandwich.

225
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,791
- Mm, bologna.
Mm-hm.

226
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:17,157
Well, I'll get right to the point.

227
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,960
I can get you information
about Divine.

228
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,873
Lots of information,
I think, if things go well today.

229
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,713
I have a date with her son Crackers.

230
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,394
Well, this is, of course,
an encouraging development.

231
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,836
This is an important assignment,
Cookie.

232
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,991
We could all benefit.

233
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,913
You, financially,
and Raymond and l...

234
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:38,435
...well, our social standing
is involved to a great degree.

235
00:22:39,719 --> 00:22:42,757
I may have to degrade myself
in front of Divine's son.

236
00:22:42,919 --> 00:22:45,388
He's into a very strange sex scene.

237
00:22:45,559 --> 00:22:48,153
I'm going to have to put up
with unheard of atrocities...

238
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:50,879
...in order to pump the information
you need out of him.

239
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:53,394
But I have to know exactly
what you want to know...

240
00:22:53,559 --> 00:22:55,994
because my so-called date
is this afternoon.

241
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:59,515
Well, Cookie, as you know, Divine
has achieved a sort of fame lately...

242
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:01,590
...both locally
and on the national level.

243
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:04,353
You may have heard the term
"the filthiest person alive."

244
00:23:04,519 --> 00:23:06,828
I have heard the term.
The papers call her that...

245
00:23:06,998 --> 00:23:09,274
...and she is known
as that to a limited extent...

246
00:23:09,438 --> 00:23:11,827
.in your more crime-conscious sections
of the city.

247
00:23:11,998 --> 00:23:14,751
Well, we feel this to be
an untrue statement.

248
00:23:14,918 --> 00:23:17,068
We feel that Raymond
and I far surpass her...

249
00:23:17,238 --> 00:23:19,468
...in every aspect of the term "filth."

250
00:23:19,638 --> 00:23:23,711
As you know, we run a baby ring.
Oh, it's really a very simple process.

251
00:23:23,878 --> 00:23:27,473
We keep two girls at all times
who are impregnated by Channing...

252
00:23:27,638 --> 00:23:29,754
...our rather fertile servant.

253
00:23:29,918 --> 00:23:31,795
We sell the babies
to lesbian couples...

254
00:23:31,958 --> 00:23:35,235
...and then we invest the money
in various businesses around town.

255
00:23:35,398 --> 00:23:36,956
We own a few pornography shops...

256
00:23:37,117 --> 00:23:38,949
...we front money to heroin pushers...

257
00:23:39,117 --> 00:23:40,994
...in the inner-city elementary schools.

258
00:23:41,157 --> 00:23:45,116
We feel that the attention that's been
focused on Divine lately is most unfair.

259
00:23:45,277 --> 00:23:47,951
She is merely a common thief
and murderer.

260
00:23:48,117 --> 00:23:51,587
Unfortunately for us, our line of work
limits our chances for publicity...

261
00:23:51,757 --> 00:23:55,148
...and travel, but this does not mean
that we wish to go unnoticed.

262
00:23:55,317 --> 00:23:57,547
After all,
we've not worked all these years...

263
00:23:57,717 --> 00:24:01,108
...in order to be upstaged
by this fat hog that calls herself Divine.

264
00:24:01,277 --> 00:24:03,188
So we must catch her off guard,
you see...

265
00:24:03,357 --> 00:24:05,427
...before she realizes
she is being attacked.

266
00:24:05,596 --> 00:24:07,906
We need information
as to where they live...

267
00:24:08,076 --> 00:24:10,590
...how many people, their names,
their daily schedules.

268
00:24:10,756 --> 00:24:12,906
We wanna know
how we can plague her the most...

269
00:24:13,076 --> 00:24:15,465
...how we can make her life
as miserable as possible.

270
00:24:15,636 --> 00:24:18,196
How we can prove to her
that she is shit compared to us.

271
00:24:18,356 --> 00:24:20,154
Shit compared to the filth
in our minds.

272
00:24:20,316 --> 00:24:23,752
Shit compared to what we know
to be the filthiest life.

273
00:24:23,916 --> 00:24:25,554
Well, does Crackers know...

274
00:24:25,716 --> 00:24:29,994
...that his so-called date
is actually a spy sent by the Marbles?

275
00:24:38,395 --> 00:24:40,591
This is my grandma Edie.

276
00:24:40,755 --> 00:24:43,713
- What's the matter with her?
- What's the matter with her?

277
00:24:43,875 --> 00:24:47,345
There ain't nothing the matter with her.
She's just my grandma, that's all.

278
00:24:47,515 --> 00:24:51,588
- Why are those eggs all over her face?
- I guess she was just hungry, that's all.

279
00:24:51,755 --> 00:24:53,189
She sort of has some problems.

280
00:24:53,355 --> 00:24:57,349
Nothing serious, but, you know,
I mean, she just loves eggs, always has.

281
00:24:57,515 --> 00:25:00,314
Sit tight.
I'll go see if Miss Cotton's up yet.

282
00:25:02,755 --> 00:25:04,427
She's here, Miss Cotton, she's here.

283
00:25:04,594 --> 00:25:06,426
Shouldn't be long
before I get it going.

284
00:25:06,594 --> 00:25:09,985
- That is, if she cooperates, and she will.
- Oh, Crackers, I'm so excited.

285
00:25:10,154 --> 00:25:12,623
I've just been sitting right here
ever since you left.

286
00:25:12,794 --> 00:25:14,751
What's she like?
Does she have a nice body?

287
00:25:14,914 --> 00:25:17,303
What are you gonna do?
Something I haven't seen?

288
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:19,545
Miss Cotton, I got something
in mind today...

289
00:25:19,714 --> 00:25:22,593
...I never, ever tried before,
something very exciting for me.

290
00:25:22,754 --> 00:25:24,313
My chicken's gonna be
in the show.

291
00:25:24,474 --> 00:25:25,953
Me and some nice juicy chickens.

292
00:25:26,114 --> 00:25:29,186
I need this so bad.
Make it better than you did last time.

293
00:25:29,354 --> 00:25:31,345
What? You said you liked that show.

294
00:25:31,514 --> 00:25:32,504
I did, I did.

295
00:25:32,674 --> 00:25:36,223
It's just that you were so fucking
beautiful in that one that I want more.

296
00:25:36,393 --> 00:25:39,272
I got to see more, Crackers,
more than what I've already seen.

297
00:25:39,433 --> 00:25:41,583
Can we have some blood in this one?
Just a bit?

298
00:25:41,753 --> 00:25:45,030
And take your clothes off slower.
Slower. And don't let her ruin it.

299
00:25:45,193 --> 00:25:47,070
Miss Cotton,
you're gonna dig this one.

300
00:25:47,233 --> 00:25:49,668
It's gonna be better than anything
I ever did before.

301
00:25:49,833 --> 00:25:52,222
I can feel my blood
all through my body.

302
00:25:52,393 --> 00:25:53,792
You know I only do it for you.

303
00:25:53,953 --> 00:25:56,229
It's only you watching
that gets me off, you know.

304
00:25:56,393 --> 00:25:59,465
- I'll make it special today.
- Please be careful not to touch me.

305
00:25:59,633 --> 00:26:02,227
- Please be careful.
- I ain't touching you.

306
00:26:11,952 --> 00:26:16,185
Oh, hi, pretty little face.
Pretty little face you got there.

307
00:26:16,352 --> 00:26:19,344
Um-- Hello, I'm Cookie.
I understand you're Edie...

308
00:26:19,512 --> 00:26:20,832
...Crackers' grandmother.

309
00:26:20,992 --> 00:26:25,111
Edie, sweetie Edie. Ha-ha-ha!

310
00:26:25,272 --> 00:26:28,628
Is Babs back from shopping
for the birthday party?

311
00:26:28,792 --> 00:26:33,149
I'm gonna go.
I got a party dress, you know.

312
00:26:33,311 --> 00:26:36,667
- When is the party?
- Oh, Babs' birthday.

313
00:26:36,831 --> 00:26:41,268
- Are you the Egg Man?
- Well, no. No, I'm not.

314
00:26:41,431 --> 00:26:42,705
Where's Crackers' mother?

315
00:26:42,871 --> 00:26:46,182
Oh, she's calling all the people
to invite them to the party...

316
00:26:46,351 --> 00:26:48,865
...and I'm gonna go.

317
00:26:50,871 --> 00:26:52,828
Well, I see you're up, Granny.
Ha-ha-ha!

318
00:26:52,991 --> 00:26:56,382
Miss Cookie, this is Miss Cotton.
She's one of my roommates here.

319
00:26:56,551 --> 00:26:59,384
- Charmed, I'm sure.
- Hello, Cookie.

320
00:26:59,551 --> 00:27:01,383
You sure are a fine-looking
young woman.

321
00:27:01,551 --> 00:27:03,302
Crackers has told me about you.

322
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:06,144
Why don't you show her the shed?
You'll like it out there.

323
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:08,221
- It's so private.
- Oh, I'd love to see it.

324
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:10,620
- Do you sleep in here?
- Of course, next to Babs.

325
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:12,667
I couldn't sleep anywhere else.

326
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:15,504
Come on, Cookie,
I'll go show you my chickens.

327
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:19,903
Oh, you have chickens?
I love little chickies.

328
00:27:47,389 --> 00:27:49,187
Hold it!
- Aah!

329
00:27:49,389 --> 00:27:51,426
No!

330
00:28:10,828 --> 00:28:12,580
No!

331
00:28:14,108 --> 00:28:15,542
Hold it! Right there!

332
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:17,907
Stop!

333
00:28:18,068 --> 00:28:19,820
Hold it!

334
00:28:20,308 --> 00:28:22,902
- Hold these goddamn chickens.
- Chickens!

335
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:24,661
God!

336
00:28:25,428 --> 00:28:27,021
Don't!

337
00:28:27,828 --> 00:28:31,582
Chickens! All these chickens.
Fucking chickens!

338
00:28:31,747 --> 00:28:34,341
These fucking things hurt!

339
00:28:46,867 --> 00:28:50,178
These-- Oh, God! You're crazy.

340
00:28:59,986 --> 00:29:02,421
EW...
Yes.

341
00:29:04,986 --> 00:29:06,260
E99 Man. Egg Man.

342
00:29:06,426 --> 00:29:08,702
- Anybody home?
- Cotton! Cotton!

343
00:29:08,866 --> 00:29:10,618
I'm in here! I hear the Egg Man!

344
00:29:10,786 --> 00:29:13,141
In here! In here, Mr. Egg Man!

345
00:29:13,306 --> 00:29:16,458
Eggs! Eggs! Oh, help! God! God!

346
00:29:16,626 --> 00:29:20,984
In here! In here! In here, Mr. Egg Man!
Here I am! Oh! Come on!

347
00:29:21,146 --> 00:29:23,262
Oh! Oh! The Egg Man. The Egg Man.

348
00:29:23,426 --> 00:29:26,464
Hello, Edie.
How's my little princess today?

349
00:29:26,626 --> 00:29:29,265
Mr. Egg Man. Oh! Heh.

350
00:29:29,585 --> 00:29:32,623
Mr. Egg Man, we're having a party
for Babs on Thursday.

351
00:29:32,785 --> 00:29:36,176
- We'd like you to come as Edie's date.
- I would be honored to attend...

352
00:29:36,345 --> 00:29:38,734
...especially
with such a beautiful date.

353
00:29:38,905 --> 00:29:42,694
And now, Edie, what will it be today?
I have grade-A extra large.

354
00:29:42,865 --> 00:29:45,857
I have grade-A large.
I have medium. I have small.

355
00:29:46,025 --> 00:29:47,584
I have brown and I have white.

356
00:29:47,745 --> 00:29:51,500
Why, look. Just look at these.
So fresh you could hardly believe it.

357
00:29:51,665 --> 00:29:54,339
Why, they're just begging
to be scrambled or fried...

358
00:29:54,505 --> 00:29:55,939
...or poached or hard-boiled...

359
00:29:56,105 --> 00:30:00,257
...or all around ready to be thrown
into a big, fat, juicy omelet.

360
00:30:00,424 --> 00:30:01,573
How about it, Edie?

361
00:30:01,744 --> 00:30:05,214
What'll it be for the lady
that the eggs like the most?

362
00:30:05,384 --> 00:30:06,818
I want them all.

363
00:30:06,984 --> 00:30:10,818
I'll have the brown ones
and those great big white ones...

364
00:30:10,984 --> 00:30:13,498
...and I'll have those over there.

365
00:30:13,664 --> 00:30:16,861
And I want some for frying
and for scrambling...

366
00:30:17,024 --> 00:30:19,459
...and for hard-boiled for snacks.

367
00:30:19,624 --> 00:30:23,936
- Oh, God, and I'll have those over there.
- All right, we'll buy them all for you.

368
00:30:24,104 --> 00:30:25,936
How's that? We'll buy them all.

369
00:30:26,104 --> 00:30:29,778
Oh, Cotton, you make me so happy,
you and the Egg Man.

370
00:30:29,943 --> 00:30:33,174
Please, Mr. Egg Man,
please don't ever quit your job.

371
00:30:33,343 --> 00:30:37,382
I'll always need-- Want eggs.
Always and always and always.

372
00:30:37,543 --> 00:30:39,773
Miss Edie, as long as
there are chicken laying...

373
00:30:39,943 --> 00:30:41,934
...and truck driving
and my feet walking...

374
00:30:42,103 --> 00:30:45,141
...you can be sure that I will bring you
the finest of the fine...

375
00:30:45,303 --> 00:30:48,022
...the largest of the large,
and the whitest of the white.

376
00:30:48,183 --> 00:30:53,053
In other words, that thin-shelled ovum
of the domestic fowl will never be safe...

377
00:30:53,223 --> 00:30:55,737
as long as there are chicken laying
and I'm alive...

378
00:30:55,903 --> 00:30:59,816
...because I am your Egg Man
and there ain't a better one in town.

379
00:30:59,982 --> 00:31:01,017
Oh, Mr. Egg Man.

380
00:31:03,742 --> 00:31:07,656
Nothing but these fucking jerk-off
hippies on the road today.

381
00:31:07,822 --> 00:31:11,258
Oh... Where are their
little pig girlfriends?

382
00:31:11,422 --> 00:31:16,496
God, I get so tired of just
driving around, driving around.

383
00:31:16,662 --> 00:31:18,539
Here's one up ahead.
- Pull over.

384
00:31:18,702 --> 00:31:23,094
- Mm. She looks real good.
- She'll do just fine.

385
00:31:23,902 --> 00:31:25,654
Thanks.

386
00:31:27,781 --> 00:31:30,739
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

387
00:31:30,901 --> 00:31:35,816
- Hi. Where'd you get this beautiful car?
- At a car dealer. Where did you think?

388
00:31:35,981 --> 00:31:37,460
- Where you going?
- Just downtown.

389
00:31:37,621 --> 00:31:38,975
Anywhere near Howard Street.

390
00:31:39,141 --> 00:31:40,654
- Meeting someone?
- Yeah.

391
00:31:40,821 --> 00:31:42,971
- Who?
- My boyfriend and a couple other guys.

392
00:31:43,141 --> 00:31:45,337
- Why?
- Going to a gang bang or something?

393
00:31:45,501 --> 00:31:46,980
What? Hey, what's with you two?

394
00:31:47,141 --> 00:31:50,099
We wondered where you were planning
to spread your VD today...

395
00:31:50,261 --> 00:31:51,376
...that's all, hussy.

396
00:31:51,541 --> 00:31:54,294
- Hey, I don't think that's necessary.
- Oh, you don't, huh?

397
00:31:54,461 --> 00:31:56,417
How would you like to fuck
my chauffeur?

398
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:59,049
- He's got a real horse dick on him.
Hey, Connie.

399
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:01,689
Hey, just let me out here.
This is fine right up here.

400
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:03,578
Why get out here?
This isn't downtown.

401
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:05,538
We're nowhere near downtown.

402
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,976
What's the matter,
you afraid it ain't big enough?

403
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:10,290
Cut it out!
Just let me out here, please.

404
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:13,100
- Sit back. Give me the rag.
- Get the fuck off of me!

405
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:14,534
Please!

406
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:19,292
There. She's out now.

407
00:32:26,139 --> 00:32:28,210
I have a new friend for you.

408
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:31,053
Already? You got one already?

409
00:32:31,219 --> 00:32:34,928
Why is she asleep? Or is she dead?
Did you just kill her?

410
00:32:35,099 --> 00:32:37,818
Where did they get her?
Where'd they get this one?

411
00:32:37,979 --> 00:32:41,574
Hitchhiking, just like you were. Doesn't
pay to hitchhike these days, does it?

412
00:32:41,739 --> 00:32:45,175
And I guess you're gonna fuck her now,
is that it? Right in front of me.

413
00:32:45,339 --> 00:32:48,536
The poor girl.
The poor girl has to fuck you.

414
00:32:48,699 --> 00:32:53,057
Thank God I don't remember it.
Thank God you spared me at least that.

415
00:32:53,219 --> 00:32:56,495
I have a surprise for you
this time. I don't even have to touch her.

416
00:32:56,658 --> 00:32:58,569
How'd you get out of that part
of the job?

417
00:32:58,738 --> 00:33:01,207
Did your boss finally decide
someone else would do it?

418
00:33:01,378 --> 00:33:03,289
Who? Her slimy boyfriend?

419
00:33:03,458 --> 00:33:05,734
Is she going to let that fag do it
in front of me?

420
00:33:05,898 --> 00:33:07,536
That whore!

421
00:33:07,698 --> 00:33:10,975
Oh, no. This is a surprise
for Connie and Raymond too.

422
00:33:11,138 --> 00:33:14,335
I have it all figured out this time.
I don't even have to touch her.

423
00:33:14,498 --> 00:33:17,570
Why did you have to touch me?
How could I have a child by you?

424
00:33:17,738 --> 00:33:22,335
What a repulsive thought.
Oh! You pig, you animal.

425
00:33:22,498 --> 00:33:24,807
How could you keep doing this?

426
00:33:24,977 --> 00:33:30,370
Oh, my God! What are you doing?
Why are you doing that in front of me?

427
00:33:30,537 --> 00:33:34,974
Stop it, you asshole.
Oh, how vile can you be?

428
00:33:35,137 --> 00:33:39,017
Shut up. Shut up.
You'll see. Just shut up.

429
00:33:40,377 --> 00:33:42,687
I swear I'm gonna throw up on you,
Chan.

430
00:33:42,857 --> 00:33:46,134
I swear I'm gonna puke
if you don't stop doing that.

431
00:33:50,017 --> 00:33:52,247
Turn your head
if it makes you sick. Don't watch.

432
00:33:52,417 --> 00:33:54,692
Think of how sick it made me
to touch you.

433
00:33:54,856 --> 00:33:56,369
And now this one...

434
00:34:03,816 --> 00:34:06,126
You repulsive pig.

435
00:34:06,296 --> 00:34:10,005
You hate her so much
you get her pregnant this way?

436
00:34:10,176 --> 00:34:14,966
Oh, my God. Stop it.
Stop it, you filthy animal. Stop it.

437
00:34:17,736 --> 00:34:19,886
Shit. I'll get it.

438
00:34:20,416 --> 00:34:24,124
- Just let me finish you off.
- It may be Cookie.

439
00:34:24,695 --> 00:34:26,925
Come on, you're almost there.

440
00:34:27,095 --> 00:34:29,166
But it's probably Cookie
with the information.

441
00:34:29,335 --> 00:34:31,929
Answer it, then. Answer it!

442
00:34:33,295 --> 00:34:36,367
- Marbles' residence.
- Mr. Marble? This is Cookie.

443
00:34:36,535 --> 00:34:40,051
No, no. I'm all right.
I'm back at my mother's.

444
00:34:40,215 --> 00:34:43,731
I was afraid to come directly there.
I thought maybe they'd be following me.

445
00:34:43,895 --> 00:34:45,806
Look, I have to have my money
immediately.

446
00:34:45,975 --> 00:34:49,286
Of course you'll get your stool pigeon
money. Why are you so suspicious?

447
00:34:49,455 --> 00:34:51,844
Naturally, I'm going to question you
about the money.

448
00:34:52,015 --> 00:34:54,893
You have no idea of what I went through
to get that information.

449
00:34:55,054 --> 00:34:57,614
You did call yourselves
the filthiest people alive.

450
00:34:57,774 --> 00:35:00,368
Well, what kind of credit rating
do you think that is?

451
00:35:00,534 --> 00:35:01,808
We need that information...

452
00:35:01,974 --> 00:35:04,250
...so we can prepare
our surprise for that slut.

453
00:35:04,414 --> 00:35:05,563
Hold on a minute, Cookie.

454
00:35:05,734 --> 00:35:07,805
She's afraid we won't pay her
if she tells us.

455
00:35:07,974 --> 00:35:10,329
Why? Isn't she coming here
like she said she would?

456
00:35:10,494 --> 00:35:11,484
Let me talk to her.

457
00:35:11,654 --> 00:35:15,534
Cookie, this is Mrs. Marble.
What is this nonsense about the money?

458
00:35:15,694 --> 00:35:18,254
- Of course we will pay you.
- I'll tell you everything...

459
00:35:18,414 --> 00:35:22,247
...but you have to meet me right away with
the money, all 2000 of it, in $20 bills.

460
00:35:22,413 --> 00:35:25,132
We'll meet you at Harry Little's
Sub Shop on 25th Street.

461
00:35:25,293 --> 00:35:27,170
You name the time.

462
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:29,688
All right, now give us
the information immediately.

463
00:35:29,853 --> 00:35:34,086
- How do we even know you were there?
- Oh, I was there all right, Mr. Marble.

464
00:35:34,253 --> 00:35:37,928
Divine is living under the name
of Babs Johnson.

465
00:35:38,093 --> 00:35:40,369
- Babs Johnson.
- Babs Johnson.

466
00:35:40,533 --> 00:35:43,366
Oh! What a stupid fucking name.

467
00:35:43,533 --> 00:35:46,332
She sounds like a chimpanzee
on a tire swing.

468
00:35:46,493 --> 00:35:48,689
She's living in atrailer
in Phoenix, Maryland.

469
00:35:48,853 --> 00:35:51,367
Who does she live with? Her mother.

470
00:35:51,532 --> 00:35:55,207
She lives with her mother
and her mother sleeps in a playpen.

471
00:35:55,372 --> 00:35:58,285
Like a baby?
Oh, God, how heartwarming.

472
00:35:58,452 --> 00:36:02,241
- And her son and her traveling companion.
- Mm.

473
00:36:02,412 --> 00:36:04,847
Birthday? A party? When?

474
00:36:05,012 --> 00:36:07,367
Oh, how perfect.

475
00:36:07,532 --> 00:36:11,651
Oh, that pig will never get away with it.
Never, never, never.

476
00:36:11,812 --> 00:36:14,088
It'll be her most
embarrassing birthday yet.

477
00:36:14,252 --> 00:36:16,641
Mr. Marble, I should be there
in about 20 minutes.

478
00:36:16,812 --> 00:36:20,442
You'd better be there or I'm gonna tell
Crackers everything about you two.

479
00:36:20,612 --> 00:36:25,242
Thank you, Cookie.
At last our plan can begin.

480
00:36:25,411 --> 00:36:27,925
Are you ready for phase one,
Raymond?

481
00:36:28,091 --> 00:36:30,446
Oh, God. At last we can show her.

482
00:36:30,611 --> 00:36:33,364
At last we can put our plan into effect.

483
00:36:33,531 --> 00:36:37,126
I only wish I could see her face.
Her fat little face...

484
00:36:37,291 --> 00:36:41,762
...when she realizes that there is indeed
someone filthier than her.

485
00:36:41,931 --> 00:36:44,127
Oh, she can eat the cover of Midnight.

486
00:36:44,291 --> 00:36:48,808
She can eat all her publicity
in front of her rotten little party guests.

487
00:36:48,971 --> 00:36:50,881
- Is her present ready?
- Oh.

488
00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:53,840
Yes. I've had it for several months now,
Connie.

489
00:36:54,010 --> 00:36:55,444
Look. Here it is.

490
00:36:55,610 --> 00:36:58,363
Oh, I've had it for almost a year now,
all ready.

491
00:36:58,530 --> 00:36:59,645
Special delivery.

492
00:36:59,810 --> 00:37:02,802
Phase one,
the filthiest gesture in the world.

493
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:04,802
Her little surprise package.

494
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:07,359
Do you think she'll like
our little gesture, Connie?

495
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:09,726
Do you think
she'll appreciate our little gift?

496
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:13,121
For over a year now,
this has been only a dream...

497
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:15,759
...only a prayer,
but we have her address now.

498
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:18,319
It is a reality. She will realize soon.

499
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:22,039
She will know soon.
Oh, Connie, at last...

500
00:37:22,209 --> 00:37:24,849
...the battle of filth shall begin.

501
00:37:33,289 --> 00:37:35,326
Oh, I love you, Raymond.

502
00:37:35,489 --> 00:37:37,924
I love you more than anything
in this whole world.

503
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:40,968
I love you even more
than my own filthiness.

504
00:37:41,129 --> 00:37:43,040
More than my hair color.

505
00:37:43,209 --> 00:37:46,486
Oh, God. I love you more
than the sound of bones breaking...

506
00:37:46,649 --> 00:37:48,606
...the sounds of death rattle...

507
00:37:48,769 --> 00:37:53,365
...even more than my own shit
do I love you, Raymond.

508
00:37:53,528 --> 00:37:57,203
And I, Connie, also love you
more than anything...

509
00:37:57,368 --> 00:37:59,518
...that I could ever imagine.

510
00:37:59,688 --> 00:38:02,157
More than my hair color.

511
00:38:02,328 --> 00:38:07,482
More than the sound of babies crying,
of dogs dying.

512
00:38:08,048 --> 00:38:11,518
Even more than the thought
of original sin itself.

513
00:38:11,688 --> 00:38:15,204
I am yours, Connie,
eternally united to you...

514
00:38:15,368 --> 00:38:20,157
...through an invisible cord
of finely-woven filth...

515
00:38:20,327 --> 00:38:25,481
...that even God himself could never,
ever break.

516
00:39:06,526 --> 00:39:09,837
That old black magic's got me in its spell

517
00:39:10,006 --> 00:39:12,885
Old black magic that you weave so well

518
00:39:13,046 --> 00:39:15,959
Icy fingers up and down my spine

519
00:39:16,126 --> 00:39:19,083
Same old witchcraft that once was mine

520
00:39:25,445 --> 00:39:28,563
<i>Round, round, round! go
Down, down, down I go</i>

521
00:39:28,725 --> 00:39:31,365
In that spin,
that fabulous spin that I'm in

522
00:39:31,525 --> 00:39:34,119
That old black magic called love

523
00:39:34,285 --> 00:39:37,038
Cotton, dinner's on.

524
00:39:38,725 --> 00:39:41,001
Crackers, dinner's ready.

525
00:39:46,045 --> 00:39:48,354
Well. You're looking pretty chipper,
Mama.

526
00:39:48,524 --> 00:39:50,276
How was that Egg Man today?

527
00:39:50,444 --> 00:39:53,960
Oh, Babs, he's gonna come
to the party as my date.

528
00:39:54,124 --> 00:39:56,923
And Cotton bought me
so many eggs today.

529
00:39:57,084 --> 00:40:00,679
- Oh.
- Look at these. So many little eggies.

530
00:40:00,844 --> 00:40:02,642
And I'm still starving.

531
00:40:02,804 --> 00:40:04,078
And I'm going to eat them all...

532
00:40:04,244 --> 00:40:08,317
...before I go to sleepy. Ha-ha-ha.
- Oh. Good.

533
00:40:09,804 --> 00:40:14,355
Mm. Smells delicious, Babs.
Thank you, Cotton. It should.

534
00:40:14,524 --> 00:40:16,480
I warmed it up
when I was downtown today...

535
00:40:16,643 --> 00:40:18,759
.in my own little oven.

536
00:40:18,923 --> 00:40:23,121
- Babs, where do eggs come from?
- From little chickens, Mama.

537
00:40:23,283 --> 00:40:25,320
They lay them, and we eat them.

538
00:40:25,483 --> 00:40:28,077
But suppose someday
there weren't any chickens.

539
00:40:28,243 --> 00:40:30,280
Would that mean
there wouldn't be any eggs?

540
00:40:30,443 --> 00:40:33,561
Oh, I don't think you have to worry
about that, Mama.

541
00:40:33,723 --> 00:40:36,317
But is it true, Babs?

542
00:40:36,483 --> 00:40:39,157
If there weren't any chickens,
there wouldn't be any eggs?

543
00:40:39,323 --> 00:40:40,836
- Is that true?
- Heh.

544
00:40:41,003 --> 00:40:43,677
I suppose so, Mama,
but there will always be chickens.

545
00:40:43,843 --> 00:40:45,560
You can be sure of that.

546
00:40:45,722 --> 00:40:47,759
But suppose someday it happens.

547
00:40:47,922 --> 00:40:50,072
Suppose someday
there weren't any chickens.

548
00:40:50,242 --> 00:40:52,756
Oh, Babs, what could I possibly do?

549
00:40:52,922 --> 00:40:56,711
And then the Egg Man wouldn't have...
He wouldn't have a job.

550
00:40:56,882 --> 00:41:02,753
- It might happen, Babs. What could I do?
- Now, Mama, that's just egg paranoia.

551
00:41:02,922 --> 00:41:06,881
I think you're being very silly.
There will always be chickens.

552
00:41:07,042 --> 00:41:08,794
Why, there are
so many chickens now...

553
00:41:08,962 --> 00:41:11,431
...that we can eat some
and let some of them live...

554
00:41:11,602 --> 00:41:13,513
...in order to supply us with eggs.

555
00:41:13,682 --> 00:41:15,638
Chickens are plentiful, Mama.

556
00:41:15,801 --> 00:41:18,839
The world will never be
without chickens.

557
00:41:19,001 --> 00:41:22,039
You can be sure of that.

558
00:41:22,481 --> 00:41:25,041
Afternoon, Ma.
- Hi, honey.

559
00:41:25,201 --> 00:41:27,590
Mm.
- Aren't they good?

560
00:41:32,441 --> 00:41:34,830
- Who could that be?
- I'll be right behind you, Ma.

561
00:41:35,001 --> 00:41:38,232
- Answer it. It might not be nothing.
- It's a fucking mailman.

562
00:41:38,401 --> 00:41:41,439
A mailman? What kind of shit is that?
There ain't no address here.

563
00:41:41,601 --> 00:41:43,353
I'll take care of it. Mother, shut up.

564
00:41:43,521 --> 00:41:44,919
- Crackers, cover me.
- Okay, Ma.

565
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:48,675
Cotton, take that gun. You know how
to use it. Right between the eyes.

566
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,956
- Yes?
- Miss Babs Johnson?

567
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:55,714
- Yes, I'm Babs Johnson.
- Special delivery package, ma'am.

568
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,029
Sign here, please.

569
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,157
What do you mean,
special delivery package?

570
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:01,231
There's no address here.

571
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:04,392
Says right here, "'Babs Johnson,
a trailer, Phoenix, Maryland."

572
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:07,632
- And you are Babs Johnson, aren't you?
- Of course I'm Babs Johnson.

573
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,155
I just told you that.
But there is no address here.

574
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,834
This is not on any road,
route, or street...

575
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,195
...and I don't want people
on my property...

576
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:18,636
...so don't ever bring mail here again.
Do you understand?

577
00:42:18,799 --> 00:42:22,155
The next package you bring me
is getting shoved right up your little ass.

578
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:24,515
- Can you comprehend that?
- I understand.

579
00:42:24,679 --> 00:42:26,192
I comprehend. I understand.

580
00:42:26,359 --> 00:42:28,828
Now you've received some new training,
as you call it.

581
00:42:28,999 --> 00:42:30,148
You'd better remember it.

582
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:33,596
You have exactly 15 seconds
to get off of my property, motherfucker...

583
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:36,273
...before I break your goddamn neck.

584
00:42:36,439 --> 00:42:38,999
One-1000, two-1000...

585
00:42:39,159 --> 00:42:41,594
...three-1000, four-1000.

586
00:42:41,759 --> 00:42:43,556
Run, you bastard, run!

587
00:42:44,958 --> 00:42:47,268
Good work, Babs.
He ran just like ajackrabbit.

588
00:42:47,438 --> 00:42:50,590
That was a postman, Ma, I'm sure of that.
Least it wasn't no porker.

589
00:42:50,758 --> 00:42:53,398
- I thought it was the cops.
- Who could've sent me this?

590
00:42:53,558 --> 00:42:56,437
Who would dare send me
a package like this?

591
00:43:01,318 --> 00:43:04,310
The return address is
"The Filthiest People Alive."

592
00:43:04,478 --> 00:43:08,108
Who would dare use that title?
Who would dare?

593
00:43:09,118 --> 00:43:12,872
It's wrapped all fancy.
It's just a birthday present, Babs.

594
00:43:14,037 --> 00:43:19,157
No, it's no birthday present, Cotton.
I smell deep, dark trouble.

595
00:43:20,477 --> 00:43:22,036
Oh, my God Almighty!

596
00:43:22,197 --> 00:43:24,427
Someone has sent me
a bowel movement!

597
00:43:24,597 --> 00:43:27,157
- Oh, Babs!
- A turd, Mama, a turd.

598
00:43:27,317 --> 00:43:32,107
Who could've sent this?
- Aah. A turd? Oh, a turd.

599
00:43:32,277 --> 00:43:33,312
Oh, Babs.

600
00:43:33,477 --> 00:43:35,673
This is a direct attack on my divinity.

601
00:43:35,837 --> 00:43:39,068
A direct attack on the peace
and harmony of our last weeks here...

602
00:43:39,237 --> 00:43:42,945
...an outrageous attempt to humiliate
and disgrace my private life.

603
00:43:43,116 --> 00:43:44,629
Someone will pay for this.

604
00:43:44,796 --> 00:43:47,868
Someone will pay with their life
for this grossly offensive act.

605
00:43:48,036 --> 00:43:51,472
Mama, nobody sends you a turd
and expects to live. Nobody.

606
00:43:51,636 --> 00:43:54,992
Why would anybody do this to us?
Why? Look.

607
00:43:55,156 --> 00:43:58,387
- Look, here's a card.
- Read it, Cotton.

608
00:43:59,796 --> 00:44:03,152
It's a birthday card,
a fucking birthday card.

609
00:44:03,316 --> 00:44:05,512
Well, what does it say?
What does it say?

610
00:44:05,676 --> 00:44:07,474
Oh, God, Babs.

611
00:44:07,636 --> 00:44:10,355
- "Happy birthday, fatso.
- Aah!

612
00:44:10,516 --> 00:44:13,314
You are no longer
the filthiest person alive.

613
00:44:13,475 --> 00:44:16,582
- We are. Signed,
The Filthiest People Alive."

614
00:44:16,625 --> 00:44:17,673
Oh. Oh!

615
00:44:17,835 --> 00:44:21,829
Just as I thought. A deliberate attempt
to seize my title.

616
00:44:21,995 --> 00:44:26,068
Egg Man didn't do it, Babs.
I know the Egg Man didn't do it.

617
00:44:26,235 --> 00:44:29,227
I don't think he did, either.
Now, shut up and let me think.

618
00:44:29,395 --> 00:44:31,955
That Cookie was asking questions,
Crackers. I heard her.

619
00:44:32,115 --> 00:44:34,629
She's right, Ma.
But why would she send us a turd?

620
00:44:34,795 --> 00:44:36,752
Who knows? Who knows?

621
00:44:36,915 --> 00:44:38,588
These are obviously jealous people.

622
00:44:38,755 --> 00:44:40,870
Jealous of our careers,
of all of our press.

623
00:44:41,034 --> 00:44:43,753
Why else would they sign that
"The Filthiest People Alive"?

624
00:44:43,914 --> 00:44:46,190
Everyone knows that title
has become my trademark.

625
00:44:46,354 --> 00:44:50,029
Why, to use it in this way is only
to insinuate that they are filthier than l.

626
00:44:50,194 --> 00:44:51,992
How could anyone
seriously believe that?

627
00:44:52,154 --> 00:44:54,065
How could anyone
be filthier than Divine?

628
00:44:54,234 --> 00:44:56,589
I'm afraid our little vacation
must come to an end.

629
00:44:56,754 --> 00:44:59,473
This must be nipped in the bud.
It's already out of hand.

630
00:44:59,634 --> 00:45:02,752
Now we must outfilth the asshole
or assholes that sent this.

631
00:45:02,914 --> 00:45:04,393
And then they must die!

632
00:45:05,354 --> 00:45:07,470
Connie and Raymond Marble...

633
00:45:07,634 --> 00:45:12,184
...while you are away,
the servants will play.

634
00:45:13,673 --> 00:45:16,472
Well, Miss Sandstone,
after going over your qualifications...

635
00:45:16,633 --> 00:45:19,022
...Mr. Marble and I feel
that you are not exactly...

636
00:45:19,193 --> 00:45:20,866
...what we had in mind for the job.

637
00:45:21,033 --> 00:45:22,944
Not only have you never heard
of Divine...

638
00:45:23,113 --> 00:45:25,468
...which is one of the key elements
for this job...

639
00:45:25,633 --> 00:45:28,625
...but you also seem to show
a lack of general experience.

640
00:45:28,793 --> 00:45:32,582
And to be perfectly honest
we feel that you are sort of a dullard.

641
00:45:32,753 --> 00:45:35,472
Why isn't Channing here
to take off my coat?

642
00:45:35,633 --> 00:45:38,830
He's getting lazier and lazier
as each day ends, Raymond.

643
00:45:38,993 --> 00:45:39,982
I'll speak to him.

644
00:45:40,152 --> 00:45:43,668
We must remember that Channing
isn't as intelligent as you or l.

645
00:45:44,392 --> 00:45:47,589
This is a high-security job,
as you can well imagine...

646
00:45:47,752 --> 00:45:50,471
...and we personally just don't feel
that you meet our...

647
00:45:50,632 --> 00:45:52,191
Oh, how should I say?

648
00:45:52,352 --> 00:45:55,708
Our admittedly sometimes stringent
screening process.

649
00:45:55,872 --> 00:45:59,149
- Who on earth is that?
- Sounds like Channing.

650
00:45:59,312 --> 00:46:03,101
Well, doing what, I'd like to know. Shh.

651
00:46:11,951 --> 00:46:15,148
I love you, Raymond. I love you
more than anything in this world.

652
00:46:15,311 --> 00:46:20,784
I love you more than my own filthiness,
even more than my own hair color. Oh!

653
00:46:20,951 --> 00:46:26,025
More than the sound of bones breaking,
the sound of the death rattle. Oh!

654
00:46:26,191 --> 00:46:27,909
Oh, my-

655
00:46:33,351 --> 00:46:36,343
And I, Connie...
l, Connie, also love you...

656
00:46:36,511 --> 00:46:39,070
...more than anything
I could ever imagine.

657
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:41,540
More than my own hair color...

658
00:46:41,710 --> 00:46:44,179
...more than the sound
of babies screaming...

659
00:46:44,350 --> 00:46:45,829
...the sound of dogs dying.

660
00:46:47,270 --> 00:46:51,184
- What do you think you're doing?
- What is the meaning of this outrage?

661
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:54,980
Let me at him. I've been waiting
to do this for a lifetime.

662
00:46:55,150 --> 00:46:56,629
No, Connie, no. Unh.

663
00:46:56,790 --> 00:46:58,781
How do you dare to be dressed
as you are?

664
00:46:58,950 --> 00:47:01,544
How do you dare to be saying
the things we heard you say?

665
00:47:01,710 --> 00:47:03,701
No. Please, listen.
I didn't mean any harm.

666
00:47:03,870 --> 00:47:05,781
- Let me go, Connie.
- You little asshole.

667
00:47:05,950 --> 00:47:07,509
You'd better start explaining.

668
00:47:07,670 --> 00:47:10,343
How dare you go
into my personal clothes closet...

669
00:47:10,509 --> 00:47:11,943
...and get my suit.

670
00:47:12,109 --> 00:47:14,339
And that's my makeup you have on,
isn't it?

671
00:47:14,509 --> 00:47:19,185
You sneaky little drag queen. You've been
spying on us, haven't you? Huh?

672
00:47:19,349 --> 00:47:20,987
Haven't you, aerial ears?

673
00:47:21,149 --> 00:47:23,982
Mimicking my wife's hard work
and her beautiful appearance.

674
00:47:24,149 --> 00:47:28,029
And having the gall to repeat words
that Connie and I spoke confidentially...

675
00:47:28,189 --> 00:47:30,829
...words that are guarded
by the holy seal of matrimony.

676
00:47:30,989 --> 00:47:35,108
Oh, I can't help it. I didn't mean
any harm. It was just playing.

677
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:37,942
Playing?
Is that what you call it, Channing?

678
00:47:38,108 --> 00:47:40,497
Or should I start calling you
Connie now?

679
00:47:40,668 --> 00:47:44,423
- Is that what you'd like?
No, Connie. Stop hitting me.

680
00:47:44,588 --> 00:47:46,181
I didn't do anything to you.

681
00:47:46,348 --> 00:47:49,864
I was just here by myself,
and I get feeling funny when I'm alone.

682
00:47:50,028 --> 00:47:52,338
Those girls are down there,
don't forget.

683
00:47:52,508 --> 00:47:55,022
And I can't stand being
in the same house with them.

684
00:47:55,188 --> 00:47:58,180
If I sit downstairs,
I can hear them screaming...

685
00:47:58,348 --> 00:48:01,386
...screaming and crying,
and then I get all nervous.

686
00:48:01,548 --> 00:48:05,428
Then I get these spells. I don't plan it.
ltjust happens.

687
00:48:05,588 --> 00:48:07,578
And then, well,
I think about my position...

688
00:48:07,747 --> 00:48:10,500
...my social standing,
just like you two do...

689
00:48:10,667 --> 00:48:11,702
...and I just play.

690
00:48:11,867 --> 00:48:14,409
I just make believe that I am you.
I know it

691
00:48:14,452 --> 00:48:16,862
isn't reality.
I know that I'm really me.

692
00:48:17,027 --> 00:48:19,496
Haven't I been a faithful servant
for two years now?

693
00:48:19,667 --> 00:48:23,979
- Haven't I given you my all in this job?
- Oh, you've been faithful, all right...

694
00:48:24,147 --> 00:48:27,538
...faithful in your stupidity,
faithful in your laziness...

695
00:48:27,707 --> 00:48:30,859
...faithful in your incompetent
lame-brained attitude.

696
00:48:31,027 --> 00:48:35,260
And now this shockingly
flagrant breach of contract.

697
00:48:35,427 --> 00:48:39,420
We can no longer employ you here
at 3900, Channing.

698
00:48:39,586 --> 00:48:41,099
That is obvious.

699
00:48:41,266 --> 00:48:44,418
There will be a complete inspection
of all your bags, Channing...

700
00:48:44,586 --> 00:48:47,385
...so do not attempt
to take any of my clothing with you.

701
00:48:47,546 --> 00:48:51,426
I will also take a complete inventory
of all my belongings...

702
00:48:51,586 --> 00:48:53,782
...from makeup-- Oh, God.

703
00:48:53,946 --> 00:48:55,584
Right on down to panties.

704
00:48:55,746 --> 00:48:58,738
And of course have everything sent
to the cleaners immediately.

705
00:48:58,906 --> 00:49:02,376
God knows what you could've gotten
on my clothes.

706
00:49:02,546 --> 00:49:06,300
Now go to your room, Channing,
and stay there until we summon you.

707
00:49:06,465 --> 00:49:08,979
Oh, please change your minds.
It was only playing.

708
00:49:09,145 --> 00:49:11,421
- I won't ever--
- Stop that yammering and move.

709
00:49:11,585 --> 00:49:13,940
Don't try anything funny
or you'll be down there...

710
00:49:14,105 --> 00:49:16,779
...with Suzie and Linda.
How would you like that? Ha!

711
00:49:16,945 --> 00:49:19,459
Had we known, we would've
given you a maid's uniform...

712
00:49:19,625 --> 00:49:20,695
...instead of a butler's.

713
00:49:25,505 --> 00:49:30,181
Oh. Oh. Oh.

714
00:49:33,265 --> 00:49:37,815
Just playing. Just playing.
I know I'm not you, Connie.

715
00:49:37,984 --> 00:49:41,056
It was just playing.
I didn't mean any harm.

716
00:49:41,224 --> 00:49:44,455
Raymond, I wasn't really spying.
It was just playing.

717
00:49:44,624 --> 00:49:49,494
Oh, what will they do with me?
Oh, God, please make them let me stay.

718
00:49:49,664 --> 00:49:52,543
I'm afraid.
Oh, God, have mercy on me.

719
00:49:52,704 --> 00:49:54,900
- Now what are you saying?
- Nothing, Raymond.

720
00:49:55,064 --> 00:49:56,816
God, nothing.
I wasn't saying anything.

721
00:49:56,984 --> 00:49:58,258
Connie and I have to go out.

722
00:49:58,424 --> 00:50:01,143
We wanna be sure you stay in your
room, so we're going to lock you in.

723
00:50:01,304 --> 00:50:04,342
Lock me in?
I won't go anywhere, Raymond. Please.

724
00:50:04,503 --> 00:50:06,096
You shouldn't mind staying in here.

725
00:50:06,263 --> 00:50:09,813
It's rather obvious that you are,
to use vulgar slang, a closet queen...

726
00:50:09,983 --> 00:50:11,018
...as they call it.

727
00:50:11,183 --> 00:50:13,936
No, Raymond, please.
Don't lock me in. Please.

728
00:50:14,103 --> 00:50:15,093
I won't go anywhere.

729
00:50:15,263 --> 00:50:17,413
I'll just stay here and be me
when you're gone.

730
00:50:17,583 --> 00:50:20,052
I won't even think about being you.
Please.

731
00:50:20,583 --> 00:50:23,780
With the shock of the obscene
parcel still fresh in their minds...

732
00:50:23,943 --> 00:50:27,538
...the trailer residents bravely go ahead
with their birthday celebration...

733
00:50:27,703 --> 00:50:30,695
...and the Egg Man lets his true feelings
be known to Edie.

734
00:50:30,863 --> 00:50:32,297
Oh, happy day-

735
00:50:32,463 --> 00:50:36,695
Edie has accepted the Egg Man's offer
of marriage.

736
00:50:38,662 --> 00:50:42,178
- You mean you'll bring me 50 eggs a day?
- Mm-hm.

737
00:50:42,342 --> 00:50:47,052
And I can come and visit Babs
and Cotton and Crackers?

738
00:50:47,222 --> 00:50:52,012
And you'll buy me a new girdle
and bra and pretty underthings?

739
00:50:52,182 --> 00:50:56,176
Yes, Edie. Yes, yes. I'll make you
the happiest Egg Lady ever.

740
00:50:56,342 --> 00:50:58,333
Don't you worry about that.
I love you.

741
00:50:58,502 --> 00:51:01,494
I love you more than anything
in this whole world.

742
00:51:01,662 --> 00:51:03,299
And right after the party's over...

743
00:51:03,461 --> 00:51:06,260
...you and I are gonna
take our first little trip together.

744
00:51:06,421 --> 00:51:09,539
I'm gonna take you
to the largest poultry factory...

745
00:51:09,701 --> 00:51:11,055
...on the East Coast.

746
00:51:11,221 --> 00:51:15,977
And then you can eat and eat and eat
all the eggs you ever want.

747
00:51:16,141 --> 00:51:19,657
A hundred eggs a day?
You mean I can eat a hundred eggs?

748
00:51:19,821 --> 00:51:25,055
- A thousand if you want them.
- Oh, I do love you, Mr. Egg Man...

749
00:51:25,221 --> 00:51:27,861
...even though
I do love my little eggies...

750
00:51:28,021 --> 00:51:29,534
...just a little bit better.

751
00:51:29,701 --> 00:51:34,251
But I do love you, Mr. Egg Man,
more than any man I have ever known.

752
00:51:34,420 --> 00:51:38,891
And I, Edie, love you more than
any woman I have ever laid eyes on.

753
00:51:39,060 --> 00:51:42,530
And if you love me just half as much
as you love them eggs...

754
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:46,978
...then our marriage
will be just as good as sealed in heaven.

755
00:56:35,010 --> 00:56:37,570
Operator, give me
the police office, please.

756
00:56:37,730 --> 00:56:42,167
- County headquarters.
- Phase Three, Raymond. Phase Three.

757
00:56:42,330 --> 00:56:45,482
Hello. I'd like to report a lewd
and disorderly party.

758
00:56:45,650 --> 00:56:47,926
No. I'm a neighbor,
and it's making me sick.

759
00:56:48,090 --> 00:56:51,481
The sight of such perverts guzzling wine
and taking dope right out in the open.

760
00:56:51,650 --> 00:56:52,924
Tell them where it is.

761
00:56:53,090 --> 00:56:55,843
It's on Philpot Road,
first driveway on the left.

762
00:56:56,010 --> 00:56:59,320
Walk up into the woods
and it's taking place in a trailer.

763
00:56:59,489 --> 00:57:02,368
I believe a woman does live there,
if you can call her a woman.

764
00:57:02,529 --> 00:57:04,759
She is a whore, officer.

765
00:57:04,929 --> 00:57:08,399
I feel, when I see these things going on,
that it's my duty to report them.

766
00:59:27,884 --> 00:59:30,319
Even with the hectic events of the day...

767
00:59:30,484 --> 00:59:34,921
...Raymond Marble still finds time
to satisfy his perverted urges.

768
00:59:35,084 --> 00:59:39,078
Watch as he not only commits
another act of indecent exposure...

769
00:59:39,244 --> 00:59:44,114
...but adds to this social horror
by making his wife wait in the car.

770
00:59:44,284 --> 00:59:47,117
Is there no shame?

771
01:00:39,162 --> 01:00:43,395
That is not the only shock
you have before you, Raymond Marble...

772
01:00:43,562 --> 01:00:45,155
"because at this exact moment...

773
01:00:45,322 --> 01:00:47,962
...Divine has learned
of your jealous scheme...

774
01:00:48,122 --> 01:00:50,238
...from the local town gossip.

775
01:00:50,402 --> 01:00:54,759
She also has your address, asshole.

776
01:00:58,361 --> 01:01:00,352
Connie! Raymond!

777
01:01:00,521 --> 01:01:02,478
They're probably hiding their asses.

778
01:01:02,641 --> 01:01:05,030
It'd be a prudent move on their part
if they were...

779
01:01:05,201 --> 01:01:07,351
...but I could smell them
if they were here.

780
01:01:07,521 --> 01:01:09,990
Come on, let's go upstairs.

781
01:01:11,081 --> 01:01:15,632
- Connie, you have company.
- We got something here for you.

782
01:01:17,081 --> 01:01:21,119
Ew. Their bedroom.
Their fuck chamber itself.

783
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:24,432
This is where they mate, Crackers,
right here on this very bed.

784
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:27,672
This is where they touch
their uninspired little organs together...

785
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:31,390
...vainly trying to recharge
their worn-out battery of filthiness...

786
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:35,269
...thrashing and moaning
in the still of the night.

787
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:37,511
What kind of shit turns them on,
Mama?

788
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:40,593
- What do they do in here?
- All sorts of disgusting positions...

789
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:42,114
...I would imagine, Crackers.

790
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:44,954
Connie probably takes Raymond's
little peanut of a cock...

791
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:46,918
...between her brittle, chapped lips...

792
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:49,276
...and scrapes her teeth
up and down on it...

793
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:52,397
...while Raymond thinks he's
getting the best head on the East Coast.

794
01:01:52,559 --> 01:01:55,950
Then they probably sit here and stare
at each other's blue and red hair...

795
01:01:56,119 --> 01:01:58,918
...while they goose each other
and say dirty words. Oh.

796
01:01:59,079 --> 01:02:01,116
Get everything real good, honey.

797
01:02:32,958 --> 01:02:35,996
Crackers, get this couch real good.

798
01:02:36,718 --> 01:02:40,029
They probably sit here and say
all sorts of banal things to one another.

799
01:02:40,198 --> 01:02:44,237
Why, they may have even decided
to send us that turd on this very sofa.

800
01:02:44,398 --> 01:02:46,309
I'm getting it on, Mama.
Don't you worry.

801
01:02:46,478 --> 01:02:47,991
They think they're filthy.

802
01:02:48,158 --> 01:02:50,034
We'll just see
what the furniture thinks.

803
01:02:50,197 --> 01:02:52,711
- Right, Mama? Am I right?
- Yes, Crackers, yes.

804
01:02:52,877 --> 01:02:54,515
Don't miss anything.

805
01:02:54,677 --> 01:02:57,669
Should I shit on the floor, Mama?
Right here in the living room?

806
01:02:57,837 --> 01:03:00,670
No, Crackers, no.
Don't do anything yet.

807
01:03:00,837 --> 01:03:03,351
Just get your saliva glands going.

808
01:03:04,277 --> 01:03:06,109
Real good.

809
01:03:08,597 --> 01:03:10,429
Juicy.

810
01:03:14,797 --> 01:03:17,471
But is it enough, Mama?
Will it be enough?

811
01:03:17,637 --> 01:03:20,515
Shouldn't we do something
a little filthier, a little heavier?

812
01:03:20,676 --> 01:03:21,996
Just to be sure.

813
01:03:22,156 --> 01:03:25,751
Oh, we still have other rooms to go.
The dining room! Ha, ha.

814
01:03:32,356 --> 01:03:34,313
This is where they eat, Crackers.

815
01:03:34,476 --> 01:03:36,945
This is where they shove dirty
portions of bacteria...

816
01:03:37,116 --> 01:03:38,993
...down their weasely little throats.

817
01:03:40,116 --> 01:03:43,996
This is where they-- This is where they
spread germs, disease and infection...

818
01:03:44,156 --> 01:03:46,147
...gobbling obscene fruits
and vegetables...

819
01:03:46,316 --> 01:03:48,704
...all in the name of health.
How disgusting.

820
01:03:48,875 --> 01:03:51,788
Get this table soaking wet.

821
01:03:54,475 --> 01:03:57,308
Oh, Mama, Mama, this is gonna work.

822
01:03:57,835 --> 01:03:59,428
Our divinity will show through.

823
01:03:59,595 --> 01:04:03,828
It'll show through all the bullshit
crammed in this little dwelling.

824
01:04:04,555 --> 01:04:09,072
The house will react, Mama.
It's gonna react real good.

825
01:04:09,755 --> 01:04:12,634
Oh, Crackers.
Oh, Crackers, my baby Crackers.

826
01:04:12,795 --> 01:04:15,594
No house can stand
the two of our venom.

827
01:04:15,755 --> 01:04:18,667
My saliva, oh, Crackers, it will work.

828
01:04:18,834 --> 01:04:20,745
Without you,
it wouldn't have been enough.

829
01:04:20,914 --> 01:04:22,951
Oh, my only son, Crackers.

830
01:04:27,434 --> 01:04:29,266
Oh, Mama, Mama.

831
01:04:29,434 --> 01:04:32,586
I just thank God above
I was lucky enough to be the soul...

832
01:04:32,754 --> 01:04:36,110
...that was placed in my body,
the body of Divine's son...

833
01:04:36,274 --> 01:04:39,266
...the body and blood
of another generation of divinity.

834
01:04:39,434 --> 01:04:41,630
Oh, Crackers!
Crackers, my only baby.

835
01:04:41,794 --> 01:04:46,823
Crackers, my own flesh and blood,
my own heritage, my own genes.

836
01:04:46,993 --> 01:04:49,985
Oh, Crackers,
let Mama receive you like communion.

837
01:04:50,153 --> 01:04:53,862
Let Mama make a gift to you,
a gift that only a mother can make.

838
01:04:54,033 --> 01:04:57,822
A gift so special it will curse
this house for years after we're gone.

839
01:04:57,993 --> 01:05:00,746
Oh, Crackers,
a gift of supreme motherhood...

840
01:05:00,913 --> 01:05:02,472
...a gift of divinity!

841
01:05:02,633 --> 01:05:04,067
Oh, Mama.

842
01:05:04,233 --> 01:05:05,985
Oh, Mama.

843
01:05:06,153 --> 01:05:08,747
Oh, Mama,
I want to accept your gift.

844
01:05:08,913 --> 01:05:12,508
Oh, Mama, accept it
as a loving son should, Mama.

845
01:05:12,673 --> 01:05:16,427
Oh, Mama,
a son that would kill for you...

846
01:05:16,592 --> 01:05:19,425
...steal for you,
even die for you, Mama.

847
01:05:19,592 --> 01:05:21,549
Oh, yes, Mama, I accept your gift.

848
01:05:21,712 --> 01:05:24,181
I accept it as a loving son should,
Mama.

849
01:05:24,352 --> 01:05:27,708
Yes, Mama, I'm yours,
completely yours.

850
01:05:27,872 --> 01:05:33,550
Oh, Crackers, prepare to receive
the most divine gift a mother can give.

851
01:05:33,712 --> 01:05:35,908
Oh, Mama. Mama.

852
01:05:36,072 --> 01:05:37,506
Oh, this will clinch it.

853
01:05:37,672 --> 01:05:39,822
This will ruin this house forever.

854
01:05:39,992 --> 01:05:40,982
Oh, Mama.

855
01:05:41,152 --> 01:05:43,951
That's it. That's it.

856
01:05:44,872 --> 01:05:47,465
Do my balls, Mama. That's it! Aah!

857
01:05:47,791 --> 01:05:51,750
Farther, farther down. Oh, Mama.

858
01:05:51,911 --> 01:05:54,300
You're the best. The best ever.

859
01:05:54,471 --> 01:05:57,748
I should have known
you'd be better than anyone.

860
01:06:05,591 --> 01:06:07,184
Crackers, somebody else is in here.

861
01:06:07,351 --> 01:06:09,262
- But, Mama! Mama!
- Oh, quit that!

862
01:06:09,431 --> 01:06:11,024
- Goddamn it, Mama!
- Get your gun!

863
01:06:11,191 --> 01:06:13,990
- Somebody else is in the house!
- Goddamn it.

864
01:06:19,990 --> 01:06:22,425
This place ought to go
up like a tinderbox.

865
01:06:22,590 --> 01:06:23,864
Let's spread it everywhere.

866
01:06:24,030 --> 01:06:26,419
God, I love the smell of gasoline,
Raymond.

867
01:06:26,590 --> 01:06:28,900
We are the filthiest people alive.

868
01:06:29,070 --> 01:06:31,664
As we have always been, Connie.

869
01:06:31,830 --> 01:06:34,265
Oh, revenge, sweet revenge.

870
01:06:34,430 --> 01:06:36,182
I wonder how that fat cow
likes prison.

871
01:06:36,350 --> 01:06:39,103
Probably couldn't fit the sow into a cell
with anybody else.

872
01:06:39,270 --> 01:06:41,989
I wonder how her party guests
like her now.

873
01:06:42,150 --> 01:06:46,700
I wonder how--
If she had a happy birthday.

874
01:06:47,789 --> 01:06:49,985
Let's get out of here.
Fire makes me nervous.

875
01:06:50,149 --> 01:06:52,379
Nonsense, Raymond.
Fire is beautiful...

876
01:06:52,549 --> 01:06:55,109
...licking and scorching
everything it touches.

877
01:06:55,269 --> 01:06:56,782
Get some more on here.

878
01:06:56,949 --> 01:06:58,508
Get their bedrooms good.

879
01:06:59,749 --> 01:07:02,343
Who else is in this house?
Where is everyone else hiding?

880
01:07:02,509 --> 01:07:05,023
Just the girls. Don't hurt me.
I won't call the police.

881
01:07:05,189 --> 01:07:07,988
You're goddamn right you won't.
Where are Connie and Raymond?

882
01:07:08,149 --> 01:07:10,902
They're out. I swear they went out.
Just the girls are here.

883
01:07:11,069 --> 01:07:13,026
- Just the girls in the cellar.
- What girls?

884
01:07:13,189 --> 01:07:16,067
The girls they keep locked up
in the cellar. Please let me go.

885
01:07:16,228 --> 01:07:17,627
Just let me out of this house.

886
01:07:17,788 --> 01:07:20,223
You can do anything.
Just let me out of this house.

887
01:07:20,388 --> 01:07:22,140
When will the Marbles be back?
Tell us!

888
01:07:22,308 --> 01:07:25,061
I don't know. I swear I don't know.

889
01:07:25,228 --> 01:07:27,219
They locked me in here this morning.

890
01:07:27,388 --> 01:07:29,698
They fired me.
Just let me out of this house.

891
01:07:29,868 --> 01:07:31,586
Please, just let me out
of this house.

892
01:07:31,748 --> 01:07:35,184
Come on. We'll go see about these
girls you keep talking about.

893
01:07:39,548 --> 01:07:42,904
Oh, please help us. Oh, please.

894
01:07:43,068 --> 01:07:46,776
What is this?
Oh, please, please help us.

895
01:07:46,947 --> 01:07:48,858
Call the police. Contact my parents.

896
01:07:49,027 --> 01:07:51,303
Please take this note.
The address is on the back.

897
01:07:51,467 --> 01:07:53,902
What's happened?
Please, tell us what's happened.

898
01:07:54,067 --> 01:07:55,819
Where are Connie
and Raymond Marble?

899
01:07:55,987 --> 01:07:57,944
- What is this shit?
- How could I know?

900
01:07:58,107 --> 01:07:59,336
I've been locked up here.

901
01:07:59,507 --> 01:08:01,976
I never saw them except
for the day they kidnapped me.

902
01:08:02,147 --> 01:08:05,105
We never see them, only Channing.

903
01:08:05,267 --> 01:08:06,701
Please help us to escape.

904
01:08:06,867 --> 01:08:08,858
I'll repay you, whoever you are.

905
01:08:09,027 --> 01:08:11,621
I beg of you to free Linda
and lfrom here.

906
01:08:11,787 --> 01:08:15,142
Please, so I can have an abortion
before it's too late.

907
01:08:15,306 --> 01:08:18,059
If you free us, we will do anything.

908
01:08:18,226 --> 01:08:21,503
Did the Marbles lock you down here?
Did they do this to you?

909
01:08:21,666 --> 01:08:23,816
Yes. I've been down here for months...

910
01:08:23,986 --> 01:08:26,705
...endless, horror-filled months
in this damn pit...

911
01:08:26,866 --> 01:08:29,062
...chained like a starving animal...

912
01:08:29,226 --> 01:08:33,106
...only hoping that I would be killed
rather than continue living like this.

913
01:08:33,266 --> 01:08:35,337
You never see the Marbles? Never?

914
01:08:35,506 --> 01:08:37,417
No. Only Chan...

915
01:08:37,586 --> 01:08:40,465
...this repulsive pervert
you have tied up.

916
01:08:40,626 --> 01:08:44,505
Please, he raped us both
so we'd become pregnant.

917
01:08:44,665 --> 01:08:48,340
The Marbles just sit up there
waiting for us to die in childbirth...

918
01:08:48,505 --> 01:08:51,816
...and then they sell the poor babies.
It's been a nightmare.

919
01:08:51,985 --> 01:08:55,057
If you don't free us,
we will die and rot in this pit.

920
01:08:55,225 --> 01:08:57,694
- They have no mercy.
- Free them, Crackers.

921
01:08:57,865 --> 01:08:59,139
I'll hold him.

922
01:08:59,305 --> 01:09:03,344
- Chan's got the key in his pocket.
- No! Let me go! I didn't do anything.

923
01:09:03,505 --> 01:09:05,018
Shut up, you filthy bastard.

924
01:09:05,185 --> 01:09:08,177
Miss Lady, whoever you are,
don't let him go. Please.

925
01:09:08,345 --> 01:09:09,744
He is our keeper.

926
01:09:09,905 --> 01:09:13,295
He has beaten me many times
and caused me untold misery.

927
01:09:13,464 --> 01:09:15,740
He's one of them!
Don't let him go!

928
01:09:15,904 --> 01:09:19,340
- He works for the Marbles!
- No. I was only doing my job.

929
01:09:19,504 --> 01:09:22,383
- I have no malice towards either of you.
There you go, honey.

930
01:09:22,544 --> 01:09:24,501
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

931
01:09:24,664 --> 01:09:29,101
- Oh, God, I can go home again.
- Keep him tied.

932
01:09:29,264 --> 01:09:31,619
There you go, missy, free as a bird.

933
01:09:31,784 --> 01:09:33,536
Thank you so very much.

934
01:09:33,704 --> 01:09:35,581
Could we chain him?

935
01:09:35,744 --> 01:09:38,577
Do whatever you like.
You can even kill him if you want to.

936
01:09:38,744 --> 01:09:41,895
Either you do it, or we will,
whichever you prefer.

937
01:09:42,063 --> 01:09:45,374
- Oh, let us. Let us.
- Oh, let us.

938
01:09:47,063 --> 01:09:52,456
- Well, Chan, the tables turn, don't they?
- No, please, Suzie, I couldn't free you.

939
01:09:52,623 --> 01:09:55,342
I was only doing my job.
Have mercy on me.

940
01:09:55,503 --> 01:09:58,256
Bullshit, Chan. You could've freed us.

941
01:09:58,423 --> 01:10:01,779
Why didn't you help us escape if you felt
no malice towards us? Bullshit!

942
01:10:01,943 --> 01:10:04,537
You kept us locked up like slaves,
bastard...

943
01:10:04,703 --> 01:10:06,137
...and you're gonna pay for it.

944
01:10:06,303 --> 01:10:09,261
I'm gonna cut
that big fat worm right off you.

945
01:10:09,423 --> 01:10:11,698
Oh, no. Oh, God, not that.

946
01:10:11,862 --> 01:10:14,615
Hey, jerk off just one more time, stud.

947
01:10:14,782 --> 01:10:17,137
- Just one more time.
No.

948
01:10:17,302 --> 01:10:21,853
Hold him. There. I've got it. Cut it.
No. No.

949
01:10:32,102 --> 01:10:37,017
- Light it, my darling.
- We are the filthiest people alive.

950
01:10:37,182 --> 01:10:39,822
Fire, fire, burn it down.

951
01:10:39,981 --> 01:10:43,372
Fire, fire, to the ground.

952
01:10:44,661 --> 01:10:49,292
Oh!
Burn, you fucker! Burn!

953
01:10:49,461 --> 01:10:52,453
Let's hurry up and get out
of here before someone sees the smoke.

954
01:10:52,621 --> 01:10:54,180
The smoke, Connie. It's done.

955
01:10:54,341 --> 01:10:58,494
- The battle of filth has been won.
We are the filthiest people alive.

956
01:10:58,661 --> 01:11:00,937
Run, Connie, run.

957
01:11:05,181 --> 01:11:07,092
Filthiest!

958
01:11:59,659 --> 01:12:02,048
- Goddamn Marbles.
- We'll take care of them, Mama.

959
01:12:02,219 --> 01:12:03,368
We'll get those assholes.

960
01:12:03,539 --> 01:12:05,815
- Mama, look, there's smoke!
- Oh, my God!

961
01:12:05,979 --> 01:12:08,618
- Oh, the trailer!
- Oh, no! No!

962
01:12:09,778 --> 01:12:12,531
on! on, no! No!

963
01:12:12,698 --> 01:12:14,655
My gorgeous hideaway.

964
01:12:14,818 --> 01:12:17,412
Oh, no! No! No! No!

965
01:12:17,578 --> 01:12:19,535
All our gorgeous antiques!
- Oh, God!

966
01:12:19,698 --> 01:12:22,133
Our priceless theatrical ward robe.

967
01:12:22,298 --> 01:12:25,450
They did it!
Them fucking Marbles did it!

968
01:12:25,618 --> 01:12:29,816
Back! Back! Back to the Marbles.
A press conference!

969
01:12:29,978 --> 01:12:32,288
Back to the Marbles
and seize those fuckers!

970
01:12:32,458 --> 01:12:35,849
I'll kill them! I'll kill them!

971
01:13:31,376 --> 01:13:33,526
At last it is over, Raymond.

972
01:13:33,696 --> 01:13:36,574
The battle of filth has been won.

973
01:13:36,735 --> 01:13:38,806
This calls for a celebration.

974
01:13:38,975 --> 01:13:41,694
- It certainly does, a victory celebration.
- Oh, Jesus!

975
01:13:41,855 --> 01:13:43,846
God, I love you, Raymond.

976
01:13:44,015 --> 01:13:46,529
Are you happy with our filthiness,
my darling?

977
01:13:46,695 --> 01:13:49,164
Are you glad that your wife
is here beside you...

978
01:13:49,335 --> 01:13:51,724
...sharing with you this bond of filth?

979
01:13:51,895 --> 01:13:54,455
This has been the most important day
of my life, Connie.

980
01:13:54,615 --> 01:13:55,889
Filthiness is a reality.

981
01:13:56,055 --> 01:13:58,205
After all these years
of nagging uncertainty...

982
01:13:58,375 --> 01:14:02,414
...I know now that we are indeed
the filthiest couple alive.

983
01:14:09,534 --> 01:14:11,366
Come to me, my darling.

984
01:14:11,534 --> 01:14:13,286
Come receive
what was promised you...

985
01:14:13,454 --> 01:14:15,684
...in the holy vows of matrimony.

986
01:14:15,854 --> 01:14:20,451
I am yours, Raymond, all yours,
my beautiful darling.

987
01:14:21,854 --> 01:14:24,733
- Connie? Connie, are you all right?
- What happened, Raymond?

988
01:14:24,894 --> 01:14:27,044
- What happened?
- The couch, it rejected you.

989
01:14:27,214 --> 01:14:29,888
Something's wrong, Raymond.
Something's terribly wrong.

990
01:14:30,054 --> 01:14:32,614
It's just out of order.
You're all right, honey. Get up.

991
01:14:32,774 --> 01:14:35,731
I'm afraid to, honey.
How can a couch be out of order?

992
01:14:35,893 --> 01:14:38,282
Something just went wrong with it.
You're all right.

993
01:14:38,453 --> 01:14:40,808
See? This chair is okay. It's all right.

994
01:14:40,973 --> 01:14:43,726
But that couch threw me, Raymond.

995
01:14:43,893 --> 01:14:46,965
Nothing can be the matter
with that couch. We just got it.

996
01:14:47,133 --> 01:14:51,092
- Raymond!
- I'm all right, honey. I'm not hurt.

997
01:14:51,253 --> 01:14:53,051
Something is the matter
with this house.

998
01:14:53,213 --> 01:14:55,204
Channing must have done something.

999
01:14:55,373 --> 01:14:57,762
He ought to know something.
We'll beat it out of him.

1000
01:15:03,173 --> 01:15:04,924
He's gone, honey.
Channing has escaped.

1001
01:15:05,092 --> 01:15:06,491
How could he have escaped?

1002
01:15:06,652 --> 01:15:08,051
Raymond, check the pit.

1003
01:15:08,212 --> 01:15:09,566
He may have let the girls go.

1004
01:15:09,732 --> 01:15:11,723
They'll call the police, Connie.
The police.

1005
01:15:12,892 --> 01:15:15,964
Oh, my God. The police!

1006
01:15:19,372 --> 01:15:21,727
Ugh. Oh!
- Aah! Aah!

1007
01:15:21,892 --> 01:15:26,011
He's been castrated!
His penis is gone!

1008
01:15:26,172 --> 01:15:28,322
The girls have escaped!
The girls have escaped!

1009
01:15:28,492 --> 01:15:31,883
They'll call the police.
Hurry. Let's get out of here.

1010
01:15:33,532 --> 01:15:37,001
- Raymond, I'm afraid.
- Hurry, Connie. Hurry.

1011
01:15:41,971 --> 01:15:43,848
Connie and Raymond Marble.

1012
01:15:44,011 --> 01:15:45,206
No! No!
Aah!

1013
01:15:45,371 --> 01:15:50,081
- Stop it! Stop it!
- You're gonna get it good, bitch.

1014
01:15:50,411 --> 01:15:53,483
Oh! Oh, leave us.

1015
01:15:53,651 --> 01:15:55,483
Well,well,well.

1016
01:15:55,651 --> 01:15:57,608
Connie and Raymond Marble.

1017
01:15:57,771 --> 01:15:59,808
I've been looking forward
to meeting you.

1018
01:15:59,971 --> 01:16:01,450
It's a real pleasure.

1019
01:16:01,611 --> 01:16:03,999
And you're even bigger assholes
than I imagined.

1020
01:16:04,170 --> 01:16:06,730
- You burned my house down.
- No, please.

1021
01:16:06,890 --> 01:16:09,530
Who are you? We don't know you.

1022
01:16:09,690 --> 01:16:11,283
You know who I am, bitch!

1023
01:16:11,450 --> 01:16:13,646
I'm the filthiest person alive.
That's who I am.

1024
01:16:13,810 --> 01:16:15,369
No, please, you must be mistaken.

1025
01:16:15,530 --> 01:16:17,760
Our name is Waldo.
Harry and Jean Waldo.

1026
01:16:17,930 --> 01:16:21,605
Shut up! Just shut up!
Gag him before I kill him!

1027
01:16:23,090 --> 01:16:25,650
Wait for the newsmen, Ma.
Wait for the newsmen.

1028
01:16:25,810 --> 01:16:28,199
- Wait till they get here.
- That ought to shut him up.

1029
01:16:28,370 --> 01:16:32,079
Hey, Raymond, you must think
we're awful fucking stupid, huh?

1030
01:16:32,250 --> 01:16:35,605
Well, here's a little something for you.
Burn down my house, will you?

1031
01:16:35,769 --> 01:16:38,727
Who are you?
You have the wrong people!

1032
01:16:38,889 --> 01:16:41,563
Shut up, Connie. Shut up!
You know who we are.

1033
01:16:41,729 --> 01:16:43,686
Cut the hogwash.
Save it for the papers.

1034
01:16:43,849 --> 01:16:46,489
You're Connie Marble and you're gonna
pay for being Connie Marble.

1035
01:16:46,649 --> 01:16:47,684
No!

1036
01:16:51,969 --> 01:16:55,280
And you're gonna pay royally, bitch.
Let this be a lesson to you...

1037
01:16:55,449 --> 01:16:57,281
.just in case there is reincarnation.

1038
01:16:57,449 --> 01:16:59,838
It's virtually impossible
to be filthier than Divine.

1039
01:17:00,009 --> 01:17:02,239
I didn't get my reputation
for nothing, you know.

1040
01:17:02,408 --> 01:17:04,968
But you found out too late, Connie.
Yeah, it's too late.

1041
01:17:05,128 --> 01:17:07,722
You and shithead here
aren't gonna be around tomorrow.

1042
01:17:07,888 --> 01:17:10,482
You're not gonna be around
to put your knowledge to use.

1043
01:17:10,648 --> 01:17:14,164
Because you're gonna be dead,
Connie! Dead! Yes, dead!

1044
01:17:14,328 --> 01:17:17,286
That's tight, Crackers.
It's so tight it makes their blood hurt.

1045
01:17:17,448 --> 01:17:19,519
Just make sure they don't make
another sound.

1046
01:17:19,688 --> 01:17:21,759
I don't think I'd be able
to control myself...

1047
01:17:21,928 --> 01:17:24,886
...if they made any more noise.
I'd have to kill them right now!

1048
01:17:25,048 --> 01:17:27,005
I just won't be able to wait!

1049
01:17:27,168 --> 01:17:30,206
I know what you mean, Babs.
I feel like ripping them apart myself.

1050
01:17:30,368 --> 01:17:33,166
- You ain't gonna be doing much talking.
- Come on, children...

1051
01:17:33,327 --> 01:17:35,284
...we can't keep
the photographers waiting.

1052
01:17:35,447 --> 01:17:39,236
We're gonna give them a story
that will knock the Newsday off its ass.

1053
01:17:39,407 --> 01:17:40,886
Come on, Connie and Raymond.

1054
01:17:41,047 --> 01:17:43,402
You have a personal appearance
to make.

1055
01:17:49,167 --> 01:17:50,760
John Vader of the Midnight here...

1056
01:17:50,927 --> 01:17:53,316
...looking for Divine
somewhere in Phoenix, Maryland.

1057
01:17:53,487 --> 01:17:55,444
Divine, you're looking fantastic.

1058
01:17:55,607 --> 01:17:58,326
Why, thank you, Mr. Vader.
I'm so glad you could come.

1059
01:17:58,487 --> 01:18:02,366
- Mat Krazan here from The Tattler.
- Well, good afternoon, Mr. Krazan.

1060
01:18:02,526 --> 01:18:05,518
Gentlemen, get ready because
you're about to witness the trial...

1061
01:18:05,686 --> 01:18:07,120
...of these two unfortunates...

1062
01:18:07,286 --> 01:18:09,641
...commonly known
as Connie and Raymond Marble.

1063
01:18:09,806 --> 01:18:12,400
Their trial will take place
in front of your very eyes...

1064
01:18:12,566 --> 01:18:14,159
...and their execution will follow.

1065
01:18:14,326 --> 01:18:17,125
- We're gonna witness an actual murder?
- A live homicide?

1066
01:18:17,286 --> 01:18:18,685
That is right, gentlemen.

1067
01:18:18,846 --> 01:18:22,316
Goldstein, Larry Goldstein.
Very tempting.

1068
01:18:22,486 --> 01:18:26,161
And I have a question for you,
Miss Cotton. Is that correct, Cotton?

1069
01:18:26,326 --> 01:18:27,680
Yes, it is.

1070
01:18:27,846 --> 01:18:31,361
Are you a willing accomplice to these
murders that are about to take place?

1071
01:18:31,525 --> 01:18:34,199
This is not exactly a murder,
Mr. Goldstein.

1072
01:18:34,365 --> 01:18:37,995
This is a court, a kangaroo court
as the headlines could scream.

1073
01:18:38,165 --> 01:18:40,600
Not a mere murder
as you would call it.

1074
01:18:40,765 --> 01:18:42,915
If we were involved
in merely another murder...

1075
01:18:43,085 --> 01:18:44,723
...it could hardly be headlines.

1076
01:18:45,805 --> 01:18:47,079
It's not just the publicity.

1077
01:18:47,245 --> 01:18:49,441
My mama couldn't go on
her everyday life...

1078
01:18:49,605 --> 01:18:51,198
...with this kind of shit going on.

1079
01:18:51,365 --> 01:18:54,118
My mama was not the aggressor
in this little war we had.

1080
01:18:54,285 --> 01:18:57,676
She only did what had to be done.
It was suicide on their part.

1081
01:18:57,845 --> 01:19:00,643
And, Cotton, I notice a smile on your lips.

1082
01:19:00,804 --> 01:19:03,796
- Does murder make you happy?
- Murder merely relieves tension...

1083
01:19:03,964 --> 01:19:08,037
...Mr. Krazan. For murder to bring
happiness, one must already be happy...

1084
01:19:08,204 --> 01:19:11,242
...and I am completely
at peace with myself...

1085
01:19:11,404 --> 01:19:12,678
...totally haPPV-

1086
01:19:13,884 --> 01:19:16,558
- Give me more questions.
Divine, are you a lesbian?

1087
01:19:16,724 --> 01:19:19,637
- Yes. I have done everything.
Does blood turn you on?

1088
01:19:19,804 --> 01:19:23,195
It does more than turn me on,
Mr. Vader. It makes me come.

1089
01:19:23,364 --> 01:19:25,878
And more than the sight of it,
I love the taste of it.

1090
01:19:26,044 --> 01:19:28,433
The taste of hot, freshly-killed blood.

1091
01:19:28,604 --> 01:19:30,833
Could you give us
some of your political beliefs?

1092
01:19:31,003 --> 01:19:32,596
Kill everyone now.

1093
01:19:32,763 --> 01:19:34,640
Condone first-degree murder.

1094
01:19:34,803 --> 01:19:37,556
Advocate cannibalism. Eat shit.

1095
01:19:37,723 --> 01:19:40,158
Filth are my politics. Filth is my life.

1096
01:19:40,323 --> 01:19:42,439
Take whatever you like.

1097
01:19:42,603 --> 01:19:44,196
Mm. Yes.

1098
01:19:44,363 --> 01:19:46,354
- How's this for a center spread?
Whoo.

1099
01:19:46,523 --> 01:19:47,558
Oh!
Ew!

1100
01:19:47,723 --> 01:19:49,680
Jesus.
Christ Almighty.

1101
01:19:49,843 --> 01:19:53,518
Divine, where will you go now? I'm sure
you're aware that after the execution...

1102
01:19:53,683 --> 01:19:55,959
...you will be the subject
of an extensive search.

1103
01:19:56,123 --> 01:19:58,399
To another city to set up headquarters
once again.

1104
01:19:58,563 --> 01:20:01,680
Of course, I cannot reveal to you
the exact location.

1105
01:20:01,842 --> 01:20:03,833
Patience, Mr. Vader, patience.

1106
01:20:04,002 --> 01:20:07,632
Another time, another story.
And now for the trial.

1107
01:20:07,802 --> 01:20:09,520
- You sit here.
Back here?

1108
01:20:09,682 --> 01:20:11,320
- Mm-hm. Sit down.
Thank you.

1109
01:20:11,482 --> 01:20:15,316
No pictures during the trial, please.
This is a court of law.

1110
01:20:15,482 --> 01:20:18,361
I call to the stand Miss Cotton.

1111
01:20:22,522 --> 01:20:26,356
Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth and nothing but the truth?

1112
01:20:26,522 --> 01:20:27,512
I do.

1113
01:20:27,682 --> 01:20:30,912
- Who burned down our trailer?
- Connie and Raymond Marble.

1114
01:20:31,081 --> 01:20:33,436
- Can you point them out?
- There they are.

1115
01:20:33,601 --> 01:20:35,399
The ones that are tied up.

1116
01:20:35,561 --> 01:20:39,839
- Who sent me a turd in the mail?
- Connie and Raymond Marble.

1117
01:20:40,001 --> 01:20:42,390
That is all.
ls there any cross-examination?

1118
01:20:44,321 --> 01:20:48,394
No cross-examination? Very well.
You may step down.

1119
01:20:48,561 --> 01:20:51,280
I call to the stand Crackers.

1120
01:20:51,441 --> 01:20:54,433
Do you swear to tell the truth, the
whole truth and nothing but the truth?

1121
01:20:54,601 --> 01:20:56,114
Sure, Mama. I wouldn't shit you.

1122
01:20:56,281 --> 01:20:58,556
How did Connie and Raymond
find out where we live?

1123
01:20:58,720 --> 01:20:59,710
They hired a spy.

1124
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:01,598
How did this spy get her information?

1125
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:04,639
By nosing around, asking
a lot of questions and by fucking me.

1126
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:07,235
That's how she got it.
That dirty little scag.

1127
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:11,997
Mm-mm-mm. Thank you.
ls there any cross-examination?

1128
01:21:14,040 --> 01:21:17,999
No? A very strange defense,
I must say.

1129
01:21:18,160 --> 01:21:19,798
You may step down.

1130
01:21:19,960 --> 01:21:22,759
Gentlemen, the verdict is guilty...

1131
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:25,958
...on all 10 counts
of first-degree stupidity.

1132
01:21:26,120 --> 01:21:31,114
The penalty phase will now begin.
I call Cotton to the stand.

1133
01:21:34,719 --> 01:21:35,834
Your oath still remains.

1134
01:21:35,999 --> 01:21:38,275
- I presume you understand this?
- Naturally.

1135
01:21:38,439 --> 01:21:41,750
In your opinion,
what should the penalty in this case be?

1136
01:21:41,919 --> 01:21:44,195
- Death.
- That is all.

1137
01:21:44,359 --> 01:21:45,872
You may step down.

1138
01:21:46,039 --> 01:21:48,838
I call Crackers to the stand.

1139
01:21:52,639 --> 01:21:55,028
- You realize you are still under oath?
- Of course.

1140
01:21:55,199 --> 01:21:57,951
In your opinion,
should these people be allowed to live?

1141
01:21:58,118 --> 01:21:59,552
No.

1142
01:21:59,718 --> 01:22:01,231
Thank you.

1143
01:22:01,398 --> 01:22:03,992
Gentlemen of the press,
the verdict is death.

1144
01:22:04,158 --> 01:22:07,116
But first, due to the magnitude
of these capital crimes...

1145
01:22:07,278 --> 01:22:10,191
...these two people must be humiliated
in front of the media.

1146
01:22:10,358 --> 01:22:12,998
Use these pictures, gentlemen,
and use them wisely.

1147
01:22:13,158 --> 01:22:14,592
We have an example to set.

1148
01:22:14,758 --> 01:22:16,715
Let the good people
of this country know...

1149
01:22:16,878 --> 01:22:19,267
...they cannot fuck with Divine
and get away with it.

1150
01:22:19,438 --> 01:22:22,635
Let them know that we are indeed
the filthiest people alive.

1151
01:22:22,798 --> 01:22:24,675
- Mr. Vader.
Yes, Divine, do you think...

1152
01:22:24,838 --> 01:22:27,192
...that there are other filthy people
in the world?

1153
01:22:27,357 --> 01:22:28,631
I mean, is it now a cult?

1154
01:22:28,797 --> 01:22:31,186
It is a very minor cult right now,
Mr. Vader...

1155
01:22:31,357 --> 01:22:35,146
...but one that is growing and growing.
Growing faster than you could imagine.

1156
01:22:35,317 --> 01:22:38,116
I will be queen one day,
and my coronation...

1157
01:22:38,277 --> 01:22:40,473
...will be celebrated all over the world.

1158
01:22:40,637 --> 01:22:44,631
Do not forget, I am Divine.

1159
01:22:44,797 --> 01:22:46,674
What a day for an execution.

1160
01:22:46,837 --> 01:22:49,226
Off the record, Mama,
do we stab them or shoot them?

1161
01:22:49,397 --> 01:22:50,626
- Shoot, Crackers.
- Good.

1162
01:22:50,797 --> 01:22:53,391
- No mess for the Midnight.
Don't forget The Tattler.

1163
01:22:53,557 --> 01:22:55,911
- And The Tattler, honey.
And The Confidential.

1164
01:22:56,076 --> 01:22:59,671
How could I ever forget
The Confidential?

1165
01:23:02,836 --> 01:23:05,032
- Come on, gentlemen. Come this way.
Come on.

1166
01:23:05,196 --> 01:23:08,746
Crackers, help me with this tar.
Okay, Miss Cotton.

1167
01:23:09,356 --> 01:23:11,472
Here, hold them.

1168
01:23:17,156 --> 01:23:19,306
Burn my mama's house down,
will you?

1169
01:23:19,476 --> 01:23:23,629
You goddamn worm.
You fucking piece of lousy shit.

1170
01:23:23,796 --> 01:23:26,674
And now for the feathers.

1171
01:23:26,835 --> 01:23:30,829
Only we're not going to run you
out of town. We're going to kill you.

1172
01:23:30,995 --> 01:23:35,148
Kill, kill, kill. Shoot, shoot, shoot.

1173
01:23:35,315 --> 01:23:37,465
- Questions and answers!
Do you believe in God?

1174
01:23:37,635 --> 01:23:39,785
I am God.

1175
01:23:39,955 --> 01:23:41,593
- You are God.
- You are God.

1176
01:23:43,635 --> 01:23:47,549
ls there no wrong?
- There is right and there is wrong.

1177
01:23:47,715 --> 01:23:50,673
I have never been wrong,
Mr. Goldstein.

1178
01:23:50,835 --> 01:23:53,349
Do you expect to get
new followers with this publicity?

1179
01:23:53,515 --> 01:23:55,312
I certainly hope so, Mr. Krazan.

1180
01:23:55,474 --> 01:23:58,193
I didn't invite you here to jerk off,
you know.

1181
01:23:58,354 --> 01:24:01,233
Get this all down.
Don't miss one single word.

1182
01:24:01,394 --> 01:24:03,385
Suppose we decide
not to print this story.

1183
01:24:03,554 --> 01:24:07,627
- What then?
- Oh, ha. Mr. Vader, see them?

1184
01:24:07,794 --> 01:24:09,705
Does that answer your question?

1185
01:24:09,874 --> 01:24:13,629
I have your address
and I know you have a wife and child.

1186
01:24:13,794 --> 01:24:15,387
- Is that correct?
- Yes.

1187
01:24:15,554 --> 01:24:19,866
Well, if nothing is printed,
we might be in the mood for a barbecue.

1188
01:24:20,034 --> 01:24:23,470
Get what I mean? A human barbecue.

1189
01:24:23,633 --> 01:24:27,467
End of question-and-answer period.
Proceed with the execution.

1190
01:24:28,713 --> 01:24:31,785
They are finished,
and a lovely couple they are.

1191
01:24:31,953 --> 01:24:33,102
Aren't they?

1192
01:24:33,273 --> 01:24:36,550
Gentlemen of the press, get ready
because you are about to witness...

1193
01:24:36,713 --> 01:24:40,991
...the biggest news event of the year.
Live homicide.

1194
01:24:42,233 --> 01:24:46,352
Connie and Raymond Marble,
you have breathed your last breath.

1195
01:24:46,513 --> 01:24:49,869
You have sighed your last sigh.

1196
01:24:50,033 --> 01:24:52,468
You are no longer alive.

1197
01:24:58,192 --> 01:25:02,584
Connie Marble,
you stand convicted of asshole-ism.

1198
01:25:02,752 --> 01:25:06,029
The proper punishment
will now take place.

1199
01:25:06,192 --> 01:25:10,550
Look pretty for the picture, Connie.
That's it.

1200
01:25:14,432 --> 01:25:17,151
No further questions.
No further pictures.

1201
01:25:17,312 --> 01:25:19,826
- I have spoken.
Thanks for the scoop, Divine.

1202
01:25:19,992 --> 01:25:22,790
- Next month's sales should be booming.
- Thank you for coming.

1203
01:25:22,951 --> 01:25:24,749
Do keep in touch.
I will, Mr. Vader.

1204
01:25:24,911 --> 01:25:27,266
Always know where I am.
Thank you for coming.

1205
01:25:27,431 --> 01:25:29,820
Always count on her for a story,
I'll tell you that.

1206
01:25:29,991 --> 01:25:31,709
She always was a news-conscious
woman.

1207
01:25:31,871 --> 01:25:35,466
The only problem is we've been trying
to get Midnight into supermarkets.

1208
01:25:35,631 --> 01:25:38,100
And it is a hot story,
all right, but it's so squalid.

1209
01:25:38,271 --> 01:25:41,627
Yeah, well, The Tattle!' will be
in the supermarkets. You can bet on that.

1210
01:25:42,231 --> 01:25:44,461
The time has come for flight,
my children.

1211
01:25:44,631 --> 01:25:46,429
Where to, Mama? Where to?

1212
01:25:46,591 --> 01:25:49,868
Let's move to Boise.
I always wanted to go there.

1213
01:25:50,031 --> 01:25:52,909
Boise, Cotton?
Why, that might not be a bad place.

1214
01:25:53,070 --> 01:25:54,947
- Were you ever there, Cotton?
- Only once.

1215
01:25:55,110 --> 01:25:56,987
We robbed a transit bus there.
Remember?

1216
01:25:57,150 --> 01:25:59,949
I remember. The number 42.

1217
01:26:00,110 --> 01:26:02,670
Let's sleep in gas station lavatories
this time, Mama.

1218
01:26:02,830 --> 01:26:05,822
Fuck permanent residences.
It'll strengthen our filthiness.

1219
01:26:05,990 --> 01:26:09,984
Oh, Crackers, that's a wonderful idea.
Gas station lavatories.

1220
01:26:10,150 --> 01:26:12,619
What do you say, Babs?
Let's move to Boise.

1221
01:26:12,790 --> 01:26:16,579
Oh... If that's what you want, my children,
then that's what you'll get.

1222
01:26:16,750 --> 01:26:19,549
Boise, Idaho, here we come.

1223
01:26:19,710 --> 01:26:22,223
I hope Boise's ready
for some star residents.

1224
01:26:22,389 --> 01:26:24,778
Why, I'll have to change
my appearance.

1225
01:26:24,949 --> 01:26:28,146
I think I'll dye my hair another color
and start dressing like a dyke.

1226
01:26:28,309 --> 01:26:29,583
Me too. I'll get a crew cut.

1227
01:26:29,749 --> 01:26:32,309
Maybe it's about time
I started dying my hair too.

1228
01:26:32,469 --> 01:26:35,587
What color do you want, honey?
I'm gonna make mine hot pink...

1229
01:26:35,749 --> 01:26:38,158
...with a DA with
Elvis Presley sideburns.

1230
01:26:38,201 --> 01:26:39,344
Maybe blond, Mama.

1231
01:26:39,509 --> 01:26:41,182
- Do you think I'd look good as a blond?
- Uh-huh.

1232
01:26:41,349 --> 01:26:43,465
Do you think it would enhance
my filthiness?

1233
01:26:43,629 --> 01:26:47,623
Oh, Crackers, you should dye your hair.
It would make you look much filthier.

1234
01:26:47,789 --> 01:26:49,382
- Won't it be fun?
- Won't it?

1235
01:26:49,549 --> 01:26:52,108
I'll have a crew cut,
you'll have a pink DA...

1236
01:26:52,268 --> 01:26:56,580
...and Crackers will have blond hair,
all in Boise, Idaho.

1237
01:26:56,748 --> 01:27:00,537
Oh, then it's settled.
Boise, Idaho, get ready.

1238
01:27:00,708 --> 01:27:04,417
You are about to receive
some migrants of a very special nature...

1239
01:27:04,588 --> 01:27:06,943
...a nature that defies description.

1240
01:27:07,108 --> 01:27:09,463
You are about to receive
into your community...

1241
01:27:09,628 --> 01:27:12,347
...the filthiest people alive.

1242
01:27:12,508 --> 01:27:14,738
The filthiest people alive?

1243
01:27:14,908 --> 01:27:18,424
Well, you think you know
somebody filthier?

1244
01:27:18,588 --> 01:27:23,457
Watch as Divine proves that not only
is she the filthiest person in the world...

1245
01:27:24,027 --> 01:27:27,383
...she is also the filthiest actress
in the world.

1246
01:27:27,987 --> 01:27:32,106
What you are about to see
is a real thing.

1247
01:28:29,025 --> 01:28:30,379
Hello. I'm John Waters.

1248
01:28:30,545 --> 01:28:32,661
I hope you enjoyed my film,
Pink Flamingos.

1249
01:28:32,825 --> 01:28:35,055
I'd like to show you some scenes
that were cut...

1250
01:28:35,225 --> 01:28:37,375
...footage I recently discovered
in my attic.

1251
01:28:38,425 --> 01:28:41,895
- Good morning, Cotton.
- Good morning, Babs.

1252
01:28:42,065 --> 01:28:44,739
Did you sleep well?
It was chilly last night.

1253
01:28:44,905 --> 01:28:47,579
Oh, Cotton, I slept unbelievably well.

1254
01:28:47,745 --> 01:28:50,418
This country air really does
something to you, doesn't it?

1255
01:28:50,584 --> 01:28:54,134
Why, I had dreams last night
that made me feel young again.

1256
01:28:54,304 --> 01:28:57,615
In the original script, Divine was
supposed to be writing her memoirs...

1257
01:28:57,784 --> 01:28:59,343
...as she hid out in her trailer.

1258
01:28:59,504 --> 01:29:03,816
Being Divine.
Chapter three, June, 1965.

1259
01:29:03,984 --> 01:29:05,736
It was about this time in my career...

1260
01:29:05,904 --> 01:29:08,293
...that I realized
I was capable of being perfect...

1261
01:29:08,464 --> 01:29:10,978
...perfect in every aspect
of human development.

1262
01:29:11,184 --> 01:29:13,778
Of course, Connie Marble
was also hard at work...

1263
01:29:13,944 --> 01:29:15,696
...and in the first cut of the film...

1264
01:29:15,864 --> 01:29:18,742
...life was even worse
for poor Channing the butler.

1265
01:29:18,903 --> 01:29:20,257
You know I hate fucking them.

1266
01:29:20,423 --> 01:29:23,734
I have to deliver the babies,
bury the bodies, help kidnap them.

1267
01:29:23,903 --> 01:29:26,656
Why do I have to get them pregnant too?
Why?

1268
01:29:26,823 --> 01:29:29,212
You said you'd get somebody else
to do it this time.

1269
01:29:29,383 --> 01:29:32,375
I changed my mind.
So just go get ready.

1270
01:29:32,543 --> 01:29:35,422
Give Susan some pills,
get the body out of the basement...

1271
01:29:35,583 --> 01:29:38,575
...and mentally prepare yourself
for this evening.

1272
01:29:38,743 --> 01:29:41,337
What's a little fuck, Chan?
If it doesn't turn you on...

1273
01:29:41,503 --> 01:29:43,460
...just jerk off and then stick it in her.

1274
01:29:43,623 --> 01:29:46,342
That way, you only have to be connected
for a few seconds.

1275
01:29:46,503 --> 01:29:49,096
I don't care if either of you
get any pleasure out of it.

1276
01:29:49,262 --> 01:29:52,095
Just get her pregnant, Chan.
That's all that matters.

1277
01:29:52,262 --> 01:29:54,538
A little baby beginning to grow...

1278
01:29:54,702 --> 01:29:59,173
...from one little fuck to $5000
in nine months.

1279
01:29:59,342 --> 01:30:02,892
Maybe it was Connie's marital problems
that made her so irritable.

1280
01:30:03,062 --> 01:30:05,576
Oh, where's Raymond? Where is he?

1281
01:30:05,742 --> 01:30:08,018
How could he leave me alone
with these servants...

1282
01:30:08,182 --> 01:30:10,901
...these stupid asshole servants?

1283
01:30:11,422 --> 01:30:13,379
Animal rights activists
always say to me:

1284
01:30:13,542 --> 01:30:15,613
"How could you kill a chicken
for a movie?"

1285
01:30:15,782 --> 01:30:19,376
I eat chicken. I know the chicken didn't
land on my plate from a heart attack.

1286
01:30:19,541 --> 01:30:22,932
We bought the chicken from a farmer
who advertised freshly-killed chicken.

1287
01:30:23,101 --> 01:30:26,935
I think we made the chicken's life better.
Got to be in a movie, got fucked.

1288
01:30:27,101 --> 01:30:31,220
And then right after filming
the next take, the cast ate the chicken.

1289
01:30:31,821 --> 01:30:33,653
Oh, good morning, honey.

1290
01:30:33,821 --> 01:30:37,098
- Isn't it a beauty today?
- Shit, yeah. You cooking eggs for Edie?

1291
01:30:37,261 --> 01:30:39,616
I wanna fry me up this chicken
when you're through.

1292
01:30:39,781 --> 01:30:41,658
Sure, honey.
It'll only take me a minute.

1293
01:30:41,821 --> 01:30:44,210
Why don't you sit down there
and keep Mother company?

1294
01:30:44,381 --> 01:30:48,055
- Did you have a good time last night?
- It's weird being back in Baltimore.

1295
01:30:48,220 --> 01:30:50,496
Went down Broadway last night
and saw old friends.

1296
01:30:50,660 --> 01:30:51,980
- Yeah?
- You remember Patty Hitler?

1297
01:30:52,140 --> 01:30:53,414
- Uh-huh.
- I saw her.

1298
01:30:53,580 --> 01:30:56,094
She almost shit
when she heard you were in town.

1299
01:30:56,260 --> 01:30:57,614
She gave me this to show you.

1300
01:30:57,780 --> 01:30:59,771
- What is it, honey?
- The Midnight, Mama.

1301
01:30:59,940 --> 01:31:01,851
- You made the cover of the Midnight.
- Oh!

1302
01:31:02,020 --> 01:31:04,660
The filthiest person alive,
they call you. Ain't that a gas?

1303
01:31:05,300 --> 01:31:07,689
My original ad copy
for Pink Flamingos read:

1304
01:31:07,860 --> 01:31:10,613
"The filthiest people alive,
their loves, their hates...

1305
01:31:10,780 --> 01:31:13,533
...and their unquenchable thirst
for notoriety."

1306
01:31:13,700 --> 01:31:16,498
Oh, Crackers, this copy's hysterical.

1307
01:31:16,659 --> 01:31:19,538
It's mostly from the press releases
I sent the wire services.

1308
01:31:19,699 --> 01:31:21,497
More fame, Mama, more fame.

1309
01:31:21,659 --> 01:31:24,048
Once the film was released,
people in the audience...

1310
01:31:24,219 --> 01:31:26,495
...actually believed
Divine was wanted for murder.

1311
01:31:26,659 --> 01:31:30,095
Oh, my God.
What a horrible photograph. Tsk.

1312
01:31:30,259 --> 01:31:33,934
My first wanted poster
and I have to lookjust awful.

1313
01:31:34,099 --> 01:31:37,649
I can't imagine I had Divine
say his real name in the following take.

1314
01:31:37,819 --> 01:31:40,811
Luckily, my hair isn't this
harsh black color anymore.

1315
01:31:40,979 --> 01:31:44,176
And look at some of my aliases
they have down.

1316
01:31:44,339 --> 01:31:48,935
Glenn Milstead? Why, I only used
that one on one day of hanging paper.

1317
01:31:49,098 --> 01:31:52,807
And look. They've even got
The Hog Princess down here.

1318
01:31:52,978 --> 01:31:56,289
Edith Massey sometimes had trouble
remembering long monologues...

1319
01:31:56,458 --> 01:31:58,972
but she had a screen presence
all her own.

1320
01:31:59,138 --> 01:32:03,052
Freddy, I want you to meet Jo Ann.
Jo Ann, this is Freddy.

1321
01:32:03,218 --> 01:32:05,607
I know you'll like each other.

1322
01:32:05,778 --> 01:32:08,452
And I don't care what people say.

1323
01:32:08,618 --> 01:32:11,258
And, Jo Ann,
I know you're hard-boiled...

1324
01:32:11,418 --> 01:32:14,137
...but Freddy doesn't think
you're tough or cheap.

1325
01:32:14,297 --> 01:32:16,527
He respects you. Don't you, Freddy?

1326
01:32:16,697 --> 01:32:18,574
We didn't have any money
for catering...

1327
01:32:18,737 --> 01:32:21,536
...so Edie was happy
to get to eat in the following take.

1328
01:32:21,697 --> 01:32:24,086
Be careful. I'm gonna eat you.

1329
01:32:24,257 --> 01:32:27,136
Edie's getting mighty hungfy-

1330
01:32:28,017 --> 01:32:30,896
Oh, don't worry, Freddy.
I have some more for you.

1331
01:32:31,057 --> 01:32:35,654
I have Rhonda, Donna...

1332
01:32:35,817 --> 01:32:38,855
...Shari and little Yetta.

1333
01:32:39,057 --> 01:32:41,446
In the original script,
Raymond and Connie Marble...

1334
01:32:41,617 --> 01:32:44,734
...also raided Divine's trailer
much earlier in the story.

1335
01:32:44,896 --> 01:32:50,130
Could Divine really live like this
out here in the country like a hillbilly?

1336
01:32:50,296 --> 01:32:54,290
God, with all these disgusting trees
and shrubbery and wildlife.

1337
01:32:54,456 --> 01:32:58,529
I'd be scared to sleep at night knowing
possums and raccoon and deer...

1338
01:32:58,696 --> 01:33:01,085
...and God knows what
would be lurking outside...

1339
01:33:01,256 --> 01:33:03,133
...fucking and shitting
out in the open.

1340
01:33:03,296 --> 01:33:05,606
I do love their nature dialogue.

1341
01:33:06,936 --> 01:33:09,610
Oh, God! Did you hear that?
Horrid little bird.

1342
01:33:09,776 --> 01:33:11,847
Just asking for it, I guess.

1343
01:33:12,016 --> 01:33:14,086
Humans never realize
the dirty little lives...

1344
01:33:14,255 --> 01:33:17,407
...these animals lead out in the country.
Makes me sick, that's all.

1345
01:33:17,575 --> 01:33:21,887
It was freezing cold the day we filmed
poor Edie's egg humiliation.

1346
01:33:22,055 --> 01:33:24,444
Look at her!

1347
01:33:24,615 --> 01:33:29,451
Well, Miss Egg Baby,
we've got some eggs here for you.

1348
01:33:34,815 --> 01:33:37,409
How do you like them this way?

1349
01:33:41,015 --> 01:33:45,372
Oh, and I've got another little surprise
for you. There. Little baby doll...

1350
01:33:46,694 --> 01:33:50,574
...all grown up.
Carroll Baker would shit. Shut up.

1351
01:33:51,134 --> 01:33:53,523
The real way Divine discovered
the Marbles did it?

1352
01:33:53,694 --> 01:33:57,653
A character cut from the film,
vicious gossip Patty Hitler.

1353
01:33:57,814 --> 01:33:59,725
Remember Big Jimmy
from down Pratt Street?

1354
01:33:59,894 --> 01:34:01,771
- Yeah.
- Big asshole finally turned queer.

1355
01:34:01,934 --> 01:34:04,608
And that wife of his,
all she does is sit around, drink...

1356
01:34:04,774 --> 01:34:06,367
...neglect those awful kids.

1357
01:34:06,534 --> 01:34:08,730
Terrible. One of them's retarded.
Such a shame.

1358
01:34:08,894 --> 01:34:11,283
And you remember Karen
what's-her-name from the bar?

1359
01:34:11,454 --> 01:34:12,443
She's dead, honey.

1360
01:34:12,613 --> 01:34:15,890
Life-affirming characters,
that's my specialty.

1361
01:34:16,053 --> 01:34:19,444
I saw her once. She was an ugly bitch.
Wears glasses.

1362
01:34:19,613 --> 01:34:22,571
And him, what a lulu. Blue hair.

1363
01:34:23,093 --> 01:34:25,607
You can see the bad continuity
coming up in this scene.

1364
01:34:25,773 --> 01:34:28,492
We forgot to put Edie's baby bonnet
back on her head.

1365
01:34:28,653 --> 01:34:31,452
What's the matter? What's the matter?

1366
01:34:31,613 --> 01:34:32,842
What's happened to Edie?

1367
01:34:33,013 --> 01:34:34,651
I'm afraid we've had more trouble.

1368
01:34:34,813 --> 01:34:37,612
Some people broke in while
we were gone and did this to Mama.

1369
01:34:37,773 --> 01:34:40,447
Broke raw eggs all over her
and dressed her mockingly...

1370
01:34:40,613 --> 01:34:41,932
...but I know who did it.

1371
01:34:42,092 --> 01:34:45,562
Patty Hitler gave me all the information
we need to solve this case.

1372
01:34:45,732 --> 01:34:48,611
Two would-be filth balls named
Connie and Raymond Marble...

1373
01:34:48,772 --> 01:34:50,570
...are responsible for this deed.

1374
01:34:50,732 --> 01:34:53,611
And now for the strangest nudity
lever filmed.

1375
01:34:54,932 --> 01:34:57,128
I've got to take a little rest myself.

1376
01:35:07,332 --> 01:35:09,005
What's the matter?
What's the matter?

1377
01:35:09,172 --> 01:35:12,448
They must have done it.
There's boll weevils in my bed.

1378
01:35:12,611 --> 01:35:14,727
A big subplot that was cut
from the film...

1379
01:35:14,891 --> 01:35:17,041
...was the revenge murder
of Cookie the spy.

1380
01:35:17,211 --> 01:35:19,725
Sharpen your blades, Cotton.
We got some cutting to do.

1381
01:35:19,891 --> 01:35:22,963
I'm using a gun on this one.
I'm not breaking my nails this time.

1382
01:35:23,131 --> 01:35:24,804
I might need them for scratching.

1383
01:35:25,011 --> 01:35:26,649
Upstairs. That's her room.

1384
01:35:26,811 --> 01:35:30,406
She better be awake.
It's so dull when they're sleeping.

1385
01:35:38,331 --> 01:35:40,719
- Where's Cookie?
- Cookie? Who are you?

1386
01:35:40,890 --> 01:35:42,483
We know she's here.
Where is she?

1387
01:35:42,650 --> 01:35:44,800
- She's not here. What is it? What is it?
- Die, bitch.

1388
01:35:55,570 --> 01:35:57,846
Rivers of gore. Rivers of gore.

1389
01:36:08,410 --> 01:36:12,323
Oh, God, you're beautiful, Crackers.
It's not just Babs I love anymore.

1390
01:36:12,489 --> 01:36:16,323
It used to be, but now it's you too.
Both of you I love so much.

1391
01:36:16,489 --> 01:36:20,801
It's your mind, your imagination,
that filthy mind with rotten ideas.

1392
01:36:20,969 --> 01:36:24,121
And your face,
that beautiful, beautiful face.

1393
01:36:24,289 --> 01:36:26,405
You like it, baby? You like it.

1394
01:36:26,569 --> 01:36:29,800
My face is yours to look at
as long as you keep looking back.

1395
01:36:29,969 --> 01:36:32,882
A lot of people like cunt, you know.
Men, women.

1396
01:36:33,049 --> 01:36:36,599
But your eyes are like a cunt to me,
honey. You can look and look and look...

1397
01:36:36,769 --> 01:36:40,477
...and still I wake up wishing you were
there, watching me 24 hours a day.

1398
01:36:40,648 --> 01:36:41,718
Them cunt eyes.

1399
01:36:41,888 --> 01:36:44,528
"Cunt eyes"?
What was I thinking about?

1400
01:36:44,688 --> 01:36:47,680
Oh, was your cutting and hacking
successful, my children?

1401
01:36:47,848 --> 01:36:52,843
Oh, Babs, it was a ball and a half doing it
again, a real feeling of true liberation.

1402
01:36:53,008 --> 01:36:55,727
Why, Cookie won't be doing
any more spying on anybody else.

1403
01:36:55,888 --> 01:36:57,208
You can be sure of that.

1404
01:36:57,368 --> 01:37:00,326
She looked like a piece of raw ham
when we got through with her.

1405
01:37:00,488 --> 01:37:02,638
- And, Babs, here's her ear.
- Oh!

1406
01:37:02,808 --> 01:37:04,879
I got the left one.
I hope that's all right.

1407
01:37:05,048 --> 01:37:09,245
Either one would have been
quite satisfactory, darling. Thank you.

1408
01:37:10,367 --> 01:37:12,040
The original curse on the Marbles...

1409
01:37:12,207 --> 01:37:14,721
...by Divine and Crackers
was even more complicated.

1410
01:37:15,807 --> 01:37:17,844
What's this pitiful room
supposed to be?

1411
01:37:18,007 --> 01:37:20,396
Looks like some kind of
fucking office.

1412
01:37:20,567 --> 01:37:23,958
Look. That must be a picture of her.
That dog has an office.

1413
01:37:24,127 --> 01:37:25,117
What the fuck for?

1414
01:37:25,287 --> 01:37:28,598
So she can sit in here with that
ugly red hair and asshole off all day?

1415
01:37:28,767 --> 01:37:31,156
Touch everything, Crackers.

1416
01:37:31,647 --> 01:37:33,923
Let our divinity and fame
be felt on everything...

1417
01:37:34,087 --> 01:37:35,725
...in this middle-class dump.

1418
01:37:35,887 --> 01:37:38,685
Look how pissy these turds must be.

1419
01:37:38,846 --> 01:37:41,918
Ugh! Central heating. How repellent!

1420
01:37:42,086 --> 01:37:44,726
I'm not even sure
I understand this part.

1421
01:37:44,886 --> 01:37:47,924
Leave your fingerprints on everything,
darling. Touch and feel.

1422
01:37:48,086 --> 01:37:51,044
Rub, touch and feel.
Take your shoes off.

1423
01:37:51,206 --> 01:37:53,004
Take your shoes off!

1424
01:37:53,166 --> 01:37:57,637
Let the rugs know we're here too.
Let the rugs know. Touch and feel.

1425
01:37:57,806 --> 01:38:00,924
But Connie didn't have a clue.
She was still ranting and raving...

1426
01:38:01,086 --> 01:38:03,316
...about catching her butler in drag.

1427
01:38:03,486 --> 01:38:07,797
Oh, God, the thought of his hairy body
in some of my fine dresses and gowns...

1428
01:38:07,965 --> 01:38:10,161
...will never leave me, Raymond.

1429
01:38:10,325 --> 01:38:14,637
To think of the value of my wardrobe
and then to think of his person...

1430
01:38:14,805 --> 01:38:19,356
...actually defiling all those fine silks
and hand-woven garments.

1431
01:38:19,525 --> 01:38:21,721
And my underwear.

1432
01:38:21,885 --> 01:38:26,834
His nipples have actually touched
where I have rested mine.

1433
01:38:27,005 --> 01:38:30,680
But that ain't nothing, Connie,
not compared to what you got coming.

1434
01:38:30,845 --> 01:38:35,840
Oh, Connie. Connie, Connie,
with hair oh so red.

1435
01:38:36,005 --> 01:38:41,397
How do these scissors feel
so near your head?

1436
01:38:43,164 --> 01:38:46,680
Watch one of my favorite scenes
that ended up on the cutting room floor.

1437
01:38:46,844 --> 01:38:48,482
Divine, Crackers and Cotton sing...

1438
01:38:48,644 --> 01:38:51,397
..."We Are the Filthiest People Alive"
in pig Latin.

1439
01:39:04,373 --> 01:39:06,681
l'd like to close
with the original trailer...

1440
01:39:06,710 --> 01:39:08,760
New Line Cinema used
to sell ""Pink Flamingos.""

1441
01:39:08,798 --> 01:39:12,705
Notice no footage from
the actual movie is ever shown.

1442
01:39:17,083 --> 01:39:18,497
How did you happen
to hear about it?

1443
01:39:18,526 --> 01:39:19,998
From some friends who saw it...

1444
01:39:20,037 --> 01:39:21,865
and thought it was
absolutely marvelous.

1445
01:39:21,904 --> 01:39:23,501
l'll be very insulted.

1446
01:39:23,539 --> 01:39:27,417
Rex Reed told us
that it's fabulous.

1447
01:39:27,455 --> 01:39:29,216
Why'd you come out
at midnight to see it?

1448
01:39:29,255 --> 01:39:30,717
Why go home at midnight?

1449
01:39:30,765 --> 01:39:32,045
What are you going to see there?

1450
01:39:32,074 --> 01:39:35,249
l guess there are just two kinds
of people, Miss Sandstone...

1451
01:39:35,288 --> 01:39:37,943
my kind of people and assholes.

1452
01:39:39,973 --> 01:39:41,955
Fantastic.
Third time l've been to it.

1453
01:39:41,994 --> 01:39:44,399
lt's an incredible
head thing for people.

1454
01:39:44,438 --> 01:39:45,688
Oh, it's marvelous. Absolutely.

1455
01:39:45,717 --> 01:39:48,479
The most disgusting thing
l've ever seen in my whole life.

1456
01:39:48,517 --> 01:39:49,826
Not to be believed.

1457
01:39:49,864 --> 01:39:51,212
Absolutely outrageous.

1458
01:39:51,240 --> 01:39:53,357
lt was divine. lt was fabulous.

1459
01:39:53,396 --> 01:39:56,215
Oh, my God!
What are you doing?

1460
01:40:03,441 --> 01:40:05,201
lt's absolutely better
than ""Cries and Whispers.""

1461
01:40:05,240 --> 01:40:09,031
l think it's the future
of city living.

1462
01:40:09,060 --> 01:40:10,378
-Out...
-...rageous.

1463
01:40:10,407 --> 01:40:12,937
Fantastic. lt was really fun.

1464
01:40:12,976 --> 01:40:16,767
Excellent. Loved it.
Really good.

1465
01:40:16,796 --> 01:40:17,883
Really good, right?

1466
01:40:17,922 --> 01:40:19,134
lt was great.

1467
01:40:19,172 --> 01:40:20,192
Piece of garbage.

1468
01:40:28,034 --> 01:40:30,757
The only part l didn't like
was the snakes.

1469
01:40:30,796 --> 01:40:32,268
l have an aversion to snakes.

1470
01:40:32,307 --> 01:40:33,288
lt was divine.

1471
01:40:33,336 --> 01:40:34,865
l love religious movies.

1472
01:40:34,904 --> 01:40:36,982
lt was a little gross,
but l liked it.

1473
01:40:37,020 --> 01:40:41,062
lt was really the grossest film
l've seen.

1474
01:40:41,100 --> 01:40:42,861
l think John Waters
has got his finger...

1475
01:40:42,900 --> 01:40:44,045
on the pulse of America.

1476
01:40:44,093 --> 01:40:46,845
l think he's got his thumb
securely up America's ass.

1477
01:40:46,883 --> 01:40:48,962
l enjoy dirty things as much
as everyone else does...

1478
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:51,877
but this isn't even dirty.
lt's just disgusting.
