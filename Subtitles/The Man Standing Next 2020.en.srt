Showbox presents.

00:00:45,222 --> 00:00:47,838
A hive media corp /
gemstone pictures production

3
00:00:50,185 --> 00:00:52,426
the film depicts 40 days leading up to

4
00:00:52,646 --> 00:00:55,604
the president's assassination
on oct. 26, 1979.

5
00:00:57,901 --> 00:01:01,644
Although based on the story “kcia chiefs,”
which was serially published in the dong-a ilbo,

6
00:01:01,864 --> 00:01:05,573
for 26 months starting from 1990, we have
taken creative liberties for certain settings.

7
00:01:08,662 --> 00:01:13,656
October 26, 1979
presidential safehouse.

8
00:01:25,429 --> 00:01:27,420
Moving to b wing.

9
00:01:27,598 --> 00:01:30,214
Vip and 2 envoy cars confirmed.

10
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:39,852
When the nation
goes haywire, we all die.

11
00:01:40,402 --> 00:01:41,858
Brace yourself.

12
00:01:45,449 --> 00:01:47,360
Will you include the president?

13
00:01:49,369 --> 00:01:50,779
We kill him tonight.

14
00:02:06,637 --> 00:02:12,177
The castle has rundown,

15
00:02:13,894 --> 00:02:18,558
only the tall grass remain...

16
00:02:24,696 --> 00:02:31,033
On may 16, 1961, an army began
military coup d'etat.

17
00:02:31,328 --> 00:02:34,536
The third Republic was established

18
00:02:34,748 --> 00:02:38,991
and Korea's first intelligence agency
was founded.

19
00:02:39,336 --> 00:02:43,750
Korean central intelligence agency
utilized its absolute power

20
00:02:43,966 --> 00:02:47,424
fo ensure president park's 18-year rule.

21
00:02:47,803 --> 00:02:54,675
Based in namsan, Seoul,
mere existence of kcia was a threat.

22
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:58,268
So-called 'directors of namsan, '

23
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,769
the kcia directors
were park's right-hand men.

24
00:03:04,486 --> 00:03:11,654
The man standing next

25
00:03:15,414 --> 00:03:18,577
40 days ago, Washington D.C.

26
00:03:58,707 --> 00:04:01,449
Do you swear to tell the truth
and nothing but the truth?

27
00:04:10,052 --> 00:04:12,008
Former director of kcia yong-gak park

28
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:14,882
chairman Fraser,
and the honorable representatives,

29
00:04:15,682 --> 00:04:19,220
thank you for giving me
the opportunity

30
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:24,230
to speak to the subcommittee
on international organizations

31
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:28,358
of international relations
that boasts tradition and authority.

32
00:04:33,492 --> 00:04:40,284
I no longer have the ambition
to be a politician in Korea.

33
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:45,784
I'm here only for the sake
of my beloved country,

34
00:04:46,213 --> 00:04:51,333
where human rights are violated
and justice is nowhere to be found,

35
00:04:52,052 --> 00:04:54,464
and for the sake of its democracy.

36
00:04:54,638 --> 00:05:01,635
I was the head of Korea's
greatest intelligence agency.

37
00:05:02,771 --> 00:05:05,513
I was rotten with power too,

38
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,313
and the reason why
I'm here to confess everything

39
00:05:11,113 --> 00:05:14,071
is to accuse a man on top,

40
00:05:15,117 --> 00:05:18,780
on top of that rotten power.

41
00:05:19,913 --> 00:05:24,247
That man is president park!

42
00:05:25,627 --> 00:05:33,090
He's the one who's making
democracy a tragedy in Korea!

43
00:05:47,482 --> 00:05:48,482
Is the president inside?

44
00:05:48,608 --> 00:05:50,223
He's getting a trim, sir.

45
00:05:59,077 --> 00:06:00,988
My men tried to stop him

46
00:06:01,204 --> 00:06:04,321
director of kcia gyu-pyeong Kim
from appearing at the hearing but...

47
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:05,541
Come on now.

48
00:06:05,709 --> 00:06:07,509
Chief of presidential security
sang-cheon gwak

49
00:06:07,586 --> 00:06:10,586
the north Korean leader wouldn't say that,
but our ex-kcia director said it!

50
00:06:10,755 --> 00:06:13,246
What were you doing
while park sold our country off!

51
00:06:13,425 --> 00:06:15,416
What's this about a memoir?

52
00:06:16,928 --> 00:06:19,635
He's been spilling it
to the media and FBI.

53
00:06:20,348 --> 00:06:25,342
Park believes that getting attention
is his only way to survive.

54
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,357
What should we do
with that traitor?

55
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:37,563
We must grab him and use him
as fertilizer in the back.

56
00:06:37,741 --> 00:06:38,741
I will...

57
00:06:40,911 --> 00:06:43,027
Take care of it quietly in America.

58
00:06:44,498 --> 00:06:47,240
Can this be solved that way?

59
00:06:48,126 --> 00:06:49,912
Did you not hear what he said?

60
00:06:50,128 --> 00:06:52,915
Which is why we must
keep it under wraps.

61
00:06:53,089 --> 00:06:55,922
America is watching this
very closely.

62
00:06:56,092 --> 00:06:58,083
Goddamn yanks...

63
00:07:01,765 --> 00:07:03,676
Gwak, you may go.

64
00:07:03,892 --> 00:07:06,133
I need to speak to
director Kim alone.

65
00:07:16,905 --> 00:07:18,486
How dare hel

66
00:07:19,282 --> 00:07:22,524
proclaim that I am the man
who must vanish

67
00:07:22,702 --> 00:07:25,114
from Korea before anyone else!

68
00:07:26,665 --> 00:07:29,122
What will you do with him?

69
00:07:30,377 --> 00:07:33,869
I'll first bring back his memoir.

70
00:07:34,214 --> 00:07:36,830
What if he doesn't hand it over?

71
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:39,132
I'll bring it.

72
00:07:43,348 --> 00:07:45,339
- Director Kim.
- Yes, Mr. president.

73
00:07:46,059 --> 00:07:49,051
Do you also wish
for me to step down?

74
00:07:51,273 --> 00:07:54,515
I held this seat
quite a while, no?

75
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,355
I will...

76
00:08:03,159 --> 00:08:06,242
Always stay by your side.

77
00:08:07,205 --> 00:08:10,538
September 18, Washington D.C.

78
00:08:14,004 --> 00:08:17,121
Kcia agent dae-yong ham.

79
00:08:34,482 --> 00:08:37,098
Deborah shim was the broker.

80
00:08:37,861 --> 00:08:39,943
- Ms. shim?
- Yes.

81
00:08:40,322 --> 00:08:43,985
Park is going around
telling everyone that

82
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,743
we can't kill him
because of the Americans.

83
00:08:49,289 --> 00:08:52,622
I must return to Seoul
with park's manuscript.

84
00:08:52,792 --> 00:08:54,328
Yes, sir.

85
00:09:36,336 --> 00:09:37,336
Gosh...

86
00:09:40,882 --> 00:09:42,088
It's me.

87
00:09:43,551 --> 00:09:45,507
You're a director now.

88
00:09:46,304 --> 00:09:49,546
Do you even know what
that position entails?

89
00:09:51,309 --> 00:09:53,516
I hear gwak is head of security.

90
00:09:53,687 --> 00:09:57,976
You got your plates full
competing with an idiot.

91
00:09:58,233 --> 00:09:59,313
Let's head back.

92
00:09:59,734 --> 00:10:01,520
You know why I sought asylum.

93
00:10:01,695 --> 00:10:03,651
Are you really that angry?

94
00:10:04,864 --> 00:10:07,822
You'll suffer the same fate.

95
00:10:10,829 --> 00:10:12,239
Writing a book, huh?

96
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:20,076
Churchill won nobel literature prize.

97
00:10:20,755 --> 00:10:23,371
I found my talent in writing.

98
00:10:24,175 --> 00:10:28,384
I'll give you the prize money
for the manuscript.

99
00:10:30,682 --> 00:10:32,513
Did I write it to make money?

100
00:10:33,184 --> 00:10:35,015
Am I after money?

101
00:10:36,354 --> 00:10:39,346
Even if the world thinks that way,

102
00:10:43,236 --> 00:10:46,103
you of all people can't do that.

103
00:10:47,949 --> 00:10:49,280
Give it to me.

104
00:10:49,534 --> 00:10:52,776
Then beg the president
for forgiveness.

105
00:10:53,204 --> 00:10:55,411
If I give it to you,
I'm a dead man.

106
00:10:55,665 --> 00:10:57,371
You'll die if you don't.

107
00:11:02,756 --> 00:11:04,121
Is that a threat?

108
00:11:07,385 --> 00:11:09,296
I'm flying out tomorrow.

109
00:11:11,264 --> 00:11:12,424
Decide.

110
00:11:13,099 --> 00:11:15,055
Stay for a while,
don't leave so soon.

111
00:11:15,226 --> 00:11:16,887
Until tomorrow.

112
00:11:42,545 --> 00:11:46,288
Park made a grave
mistake he couldn't have

113
00:11:46,716 --> 00:11:49,128
without your help, Ms. shim.

114
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:53,587
I'm the victim here.
Lobbyist Deborah shim

115
00:11:53,807 --> 00:11:57,095
you know how I worked
to become a lobbyist here.

116
00:11:57,477 --> 00:12:01,641
I suffered racism for
coming from a poor country,

117
00:12:02,148 --> 00:12:04,855
no one here can even tell
North Korea from south.

118
00:12:05,485 --> 00:12:10,445
I endured all that
in service of our country.

119
00:12:10,698 --> 00:12:13,485
But when koreagate blew up,
you all shunned me,

120
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:16,242
and FBI threatens me to jail me
if I don't cooperate.

121
00:12:16,412 --> 00:12:18,027
What am I to do?

122
00:12:26,923 --> 00:12:31,587
So you sold Korea
with park as a front?

123
00:12:31,886 --> 00:12:35,595
A good girl goes to heaven
but a bad one goes anywhere.

124
00:12:35,974 --> 00:12:37,555
Can't return home.

125
00:12:37,725 --> 00:12:41,092
Even a bad girl can't go
anywhere without money.

126
00:12:45,191 --> 00:12:48,649
You're now responsible
for ex-dir. Park.

127
00:12:49,654 --> 00:12:52,111
Give my agent every detail.

128
00:12:55,493 --> 00:12:58,405
Your family back home
wants you to call them.

129
00:12:59,038 --> 00:13:01,074
Are you threatening me?

130
00:13:31,321 --> 00:13:32,777
It's peaceful.

131
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:34,740
So peaceful...

132
00:13:35,575 --> 00:13:37,361
Gyu-pyeong,

133
00:13:37,869 --> 00:13:40,736
why did you want the revolution?

134
00:13:42,707 --> 00:13:44,663
And why did you?

135
00:13:46,085 --> 00:13:48,667
I only did it because
you wanted to.

136
00:13:49,505 --> 00:13:50,711
I did?

137
00:13:53,343 --> 00:13:55,299
It wasn't you?

138
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:58,590
Me?

139
00:14:04,979 --> 00:14:06,435
Goddammit.

140
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:09,931
- I don't know...
- Did you bring it?

141
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:27,328
Wait for this thing to blow over,

142
00:14:28,086 --> 00:14:31,078
then return home quietly.

143
00:14:33,925 --> 00:14:34,960
Director Kim.

144
00:14:36,386 --> 00:14:39,799
Do you know why
I'm giving this to you?

145
00:14:44,769 --> 00:14:49,479
Even if I die,
I won't die in your hands.

146
00:14:55,655 --> 00:14:57,111
Let's walk.

147
00:14:58,616 --> 00:15:02,074
Ever heard of 'lago'?

148
00:15:02,495 --> 00:15:04,702
Iago from othello?

149
00:15:05,665 --> 00:15:10,125
A pen suits you better
than a gun.

150
00:15:10,712 --> 00:15:12,623
What do you want to say?

151
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,713
President park has a 'personal
intelligence agency, '

152
00:15:15,883 --> 00:15:19,216
and that's what CIA's
calling the man behind it.

153
00:15:19,554 --> 00:15:20,919
Iago.

154
00:15:24,225 --> 00:15:29,345
I'm saying there's someone
with higher authority over us.

155
00:15:29,605 --> 00:15:31,141
Give me a reliable source.

156
00:15:31,315 --> 00:15:33,931
CIA has been digging into
the president's money trail,

157
00:15:34,694 --> 00:15:37,185
they found out that
he's been funneling money

158
00:15:37,363 --> 00:15:40,275
into Swiss accounts and slush
funds behind kcia's back.

159
00:15:40,867 --> 00:15:46,328
He's trusting his personal
agency with it, not kcia.

160
00:15:46,539 --> 00:15:47,904
Who is that?

161
00:15:49,167 --> 00:15:51,203
- That I don't know.
- Since when?

162
00:15:53,337 --> 00:15:57,125
I believe it's since the revolution.

163
00:16:00,303 --> 00:16:02,385
To the revolutionary comrades!

164
00:16:02,555 --> 00:16:04,261
To the comrades!

165
00:16:09,145 --> 00:16:10,601
He will be one of us.

166
00:16:10,772 --> 00:16:13,764
The president only trusts
those he knows intimately.

167
00:16:14,233 --> 00:16:16,019
I'm sure it was no big deal then.

168
00:16:16,194 --> 00:16:18,731
He did our background checks,

169
00:16:19,489 --> 00:16:22,481
and did things the president
was embarrassed of making us do.

170
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:25,032
Then the president's power grew,

171
00:16:25,203 --> 00:16:28,320
so did his rivals,
and the money piled up.

172
00:16:29,832 --> 00:16:33,324
He couldn't lose any of it,
but couldn't trust anyone.

173
00:16:35,463 --> 00:16:36,828
Congratulations, sir.

174
00:16:37,006 --> 00:16:39,463
The world thought we were
second in command,

175
00:16:39,634 --> 00:16:41,124
but no.

176
00:16:41,594 --> 00:16:44,631
The real deal was someone else.

177
00:16:46,265 --> 00:16:51,180
He had another man sucking
on his tits beside me.

178
00:16:51,813 --> 00:16:55,397
You and I were just errand boys!

179
00:16:58,903 --> 00:17:00,313
Director Kim,

180
00:17:00,488 --> 00:17:04,777
how long do you think
the Americans will let him be?

181
00:17:05,493 --> 00:17:08,155
It'll be over in a year.

182
00:17:10,081 --> 00:17:12,163
He's making preparations.

183
00:17:12,834 --> 00:17:16,668
He'll step down slowly,
and I'll be helping him.

184
00:17:17,713 --> 00:17:20,876
You believe that bullshit?

185
00:17:22,301 --> 00:17:25,043
Look at it.

186
00:17:25,763 --> 00:17:29,381
This is like the Greek temple.

187
00:17:30,726 --> 00:17:34,685
But Lincoln is like god here.

188
00:17:36,315 --> 00:17:39,148
He still got shot and died.

189
00:17:46,742 --> 00:17:48,073
Gyu-pyeond.

190
00:17:49,954 --> 00:17:52,411
Why did we go through
with the revolution?

191
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:55,953
Why did we risk our lives for it?

192
00:18:20,526 --> 00:18:24,110
September 20, presidential safehouse

193
00:18:28,951 --> 00:18:32,535
park's book title is
'traitor of the revolution.'

194
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:37,373
so I betrayed the revolution?

195
00:18:39,295 --> 00:18:42,002
'In the battlefield
called “revolution”,

196
00:18:42,173 --> 00:18:46,917
president park led us valiantly
like a flag at the front.

197
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:49,461
But the war is over.

198
00:18:50,389 --> 00:18:53,802
He alone remains
on the battlefield.

199
00:18:54,936 --> 00:18:57,143
A flag tattered
and covered in blood,

200
00:18:57,313 --> 00:18:59,645
as it dances in the wind,

201
00:19:02,235 --> 00:19:04,021
he is the evidence of defeat.'

202
00:19:06,864 --> 00:19:13,861
so many beasts
waiting to tear me apart.

203
00:19:20,628 --> 00:19:23,040
I gotta leave them something.

204
00:19:23,214 --> 00:19:25,705
They're all waiting for me to die.

205
00:19:31,389 --> 00:19:33,926
What did park say?
Does he want me dead?

206
00:19:34,225 --> 00:19:35,225
No, sir.

207
00:19:36,143 --> 00:19:39,635
He has come around
and regrets deeply.

208
00:19:39,814 --> 00:19:43,227
Please forgive him for my sake.

209
00:19:43,526 --> 00:19:48,395
He should've taken
a break and waited.

210
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,570
Mr. president.

211
00:19:55,288 --> 00:19:59,748
Have you heard of 'lago'?

212
00:20:03,462 --> 00:20:04,827
What is it?

213
00:20:14,807 --> 00:20:17,594
Shall we have rice wine cocktail?

214
00:20:18,269 --> 00:20:22,433
The ratio is very important.

215
00:20:28,529 --> 00:20:29,529
Here.

216
00:20:59,101 --> 00:21:00,557
It's not like the old days.

217
00:21:05,066 --> 00:21:07,523
Weren't you the 36th
regimental commander?

218
00:21:07,902 --> 00:21:08,902
Yes.

219
00:21:09,111 --> 00:21:11,568
The drink we had back then...

220
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:14,321
Was the greatest.

221
00:21:19,038 --> 00:21:20,699
Those were...

222
00:21:22,249 --> 00:21:23,409
The days.

223
00:21:27,338 --> 00:21:28,999
Those days

224
00:21:29,173 --> 00:21:30,458
were great.

225
00:21:37,098 --> 00:21:39,464
September 21, blue house

226
00:21:40,684 --> 00:21:42,265
pull that out.

227
00:21:44,146 --> 00:21:45,807
Rip them apart!

228
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,726
Take out all the books
and check them out!

229
00:21:49,402 --> 00:21:51,734
Find every piece of yank's hair!

230
00:21:53,239 --> 00:21:55,525
Rip the bottom of sofa
and look there too.

231
00:21:55,741 --> 00:21:57,606
Find it thoroughly!

232
00:21:59,829 --> 00:22:02,866
Plunder of sovereignty!
Do you see?

233
00:22:03,165 --> 00:22:04,165
What?

234
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:07,788
How could the kcia not know
when the yanks wiretapped

235
00:22:08,087 --> 00:22:09,827
our president's office!

236
00:22:10,005 --> 00:22:11,791
I'm appalled!

237
00:22:12,466 --> 00:22:14,297
They're gunning for us!

238
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:15,545
Who are they?

239
00:22:15,761 --> 00:22:18,218
We confirmed it's CIA,
we are scanning everything!

240
00:22:18,389 --> 00:22:20,630
Get them out. Call our guys.

241
00:22:20,975 --> 00:22:23,387
How could I trust someone
so incompetent?

242
00:22:23,602 --> 00:22:25,763
- Your excellency is entering.
- Get them out right...

243
00:22:38,409 --> 00:22:40,821
Goddamn ignorant bastards!

244
00:22:41,495 --> 00:22:43,827
They're taking us for fools,

245
00:22:44,081 --> 00:22:47,039
how dare they bug
the president's desk!

246
00:22:48,878 --> 00:22:51,085
What the hell were you doing?

247
00:22:51,505 --> 00:22:53,370
I'll look into it, sir.

248
00:22:53,966 --> 00:22:56,457
You must send an envoy
and make a strong objection.

249
00:22:56,635 --> 00:22:59,752
The un should know about this!

250
00:23:00,681 --> 00:23:03,923
Am I right, Mr. secretary?
Chief secretary gye-hoon Kim

251
00:23:04,143 --> 00:23:07,055
get me the ambassador!
Have him kneel before our flag!

252
00:23:07,521 --> 00:23:10,979
Korea's pride is on the line!

253
00:23:29,168 --> 00:23:32,331
Us ambassador Robert.

254
00:23:57,029 --> 00:23:58,064
Goddammit!

255
00:24:53,752 --> 00:24:55,538
Kcia assistant secretary
Chang-su kang

256
00:24:55,754 --> 00:24:58,496
sir, I looked into those guys
gwak brought in for bugs.

257
00:24:58,841 --> 00:25:01,423
Strangely, there was
a professor among them.

258
00:25:02,052 --> 00:25:03,132
A professor?

259
00:25:03,345 --> 00:25:07,759
Educated in America, he's training
the security division's wiretap team.

260
00:25:09,351 --> 00:25:10,887
Find out more about him.

261
00:25:11,228 --> 00:25:12,228
Yes, sir.

262
00:25:26,577 --> 00:25:30,320
Gwak must've brought in
tanks to protect the president.

263
00:25:39,131 --> 00:25:40,746
I told you not to do this!

264
00:25:41,884 --> 00:25:43,840
That son of a bitch!

265
00:25:46,805 --> 00:25:48,921
Are we on a cursed land?

266
00:25:49,099 --> 00:25:51,385
Why are all security chiefs
so moronic?

267
00:25:51,602 --> 00:25:53,012
Why are tanks guarding here?

268
00:25:53,187 --> 00:25:55,803
Does it elevate
the president's authority?

269
00:25:56,148 --> 00:26:00,608
Seniors in the area
had heart attacks,

270
00:26:00,903 --> 00:26:02,859
thinking it was a commie invasion.

271
00:26:05,032 --> 00:26:08,900
Gwak even kicked assemblymen
in the knees at national assembly.

272
00:26:12,498 --> 00:26:14,409
Can't you do something?

273
00:26:14,583 --> 00:26:19,828
There's a rumor that the president
only cares for gwak lately.

274
00:26:21,882 --> 00:26:24,544
He has to look after the idiot.

275
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,796
Congratulations
from chief executive gwak

276
00:26:28,013 --> 00:26:30,174
security commander du-hyeok chun

277
00:26:31,975 --> 00:26:33,181
thank you, sir.

278
00:26:34,019 --> 00:26:35,350
It'll come in handy.

279
00:26:36,897 --> 00:26:38,182
By the way, general chun,

280
00:26:38,982 --> 00:26:42,349
are you in bad terms
with director Kim?

281
00:26:43,028 --> 00:26:45,189
What do you mean, sir?

282
00:26:45,614 --> 00:26:49,823
When I recommended you
for security commander,

283
00:26:50,369 --> 00:26:52,485
Kim objected heavily.

284
00:26:52,996 --> 00:26:55,078
Is that right?

285
00:26:56,834 --> 00:26:58,244
Director of kcia is here.

286
00:26:58,419 --> 00:27:00,125
What? Director Kim?

287
00:27:01,714 --> 00:27:03,204
Tell him I'm not here.

288
00:27:14,101 --> 00:27:15,557
Director Kim.

289
00:27:16,145 --> 00:27:18,056
I actually wanted to talk to you.

290
00:27:18,272 --> 00:27:19,512
Please sit down.

291
00:27:20,482 --> 00:27:24,566
I'm told you played soldier
at national assembly yesterday.

292
00:27:24,945 --> 00:27:30,065
I heard the opposition party
was on a hunger strike,

293
00:27:31,618 --> 00:27:33,654
so I went there to feed them.

294
00:27:33,871 --> 00:27:35,407
Isn't this your duty?

295
00:27:35,581 --> 00:27:37,822
Kcia doesn't do that now.

296
00:27:38,459 --> 00:27:40,541
Then what does kcia do?

297
00:27:41,503 --> 00:27:44,040
You didn't even know
CIA bugged the president!

298
00:27:46,508 --> 00:27:48,920
Men have personalities,

299
00:27:49,428 --> 00:27:51,635
and nations have dignity.

300
00:27:51,972 --> 00:27:53,678
This is the blue house.

301
00:27:53,849 --> 00:27:56,010
It's where personality
and dignity come together.

302
00:27:57,144 --> 00:28:01,683
Send in the tanks again,
and I'll bulldoze your office first.

303
00:28:04,234 --> 00:28:08,193
Stop acting out and
protect the president!

304
00:28:09,031 --> 00:28:11,738
Got that, it. Col. Gwak?

305
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:17,740
Director Kim.

306
00:28:18,457 --> 00:28:20,368
He is the country.

307
00:28:21,001 --> 00:28:23,492
It is my duty to
protect the country.

308
00:28:24,087 --> 00:28:26,749
You're the one who doesn't
know what your duty is.

309
00:28:26,924 --> 00:28:28,460
You know that saying,

310
00:28:28,634 --> 00:28:31,171
work in the shade and
face the sun or something.

311
00:28:31,345 --> 00:28:34,178
Think of yourself
as a mushroom or moss

312
00:28:34,348 --> 00:28:36,964
and stay in the dark
and moist room.

313
00:28:37,518 --> 00:28:38,928
You disgusting cockroach!

314
00:28:39,102 --> 00:28:41,138
Why are you here
pretending to be a man?

315
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:45,268
This is not the place
for you to mess around!

316
00:28:47,736 --> 00:28:51,103
The president and others
should see this!

317
00:28:51,907 --> 00:28:53,738
Why are you so titillated?!

318
00:28:53,951 --> 00:28:57,239
I hope others don't think
we did anything explicit!

319
00:28:57,412 --> 00:28:58,527
So embarrassing!

320
00:28:59,915 --> 00:29:00,995
Son of a bitch!

321
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,116
I'll bury you in the backyard!

322
00:29:04,294 --> 00:29:05,294
Stupid asshole!

323
00:29:06,088 --> 00:29:08,124
- Goddamn cockroach!
- Son of a bitch!

324
00:29:08,382 --> 00:29:09,997
- Shithead!
- You bastard!

325
00:29:11,218 --> 00:29:12,298
- Director!
- Sirl

326
00:29:12,761 --> 00:29:14,797
you're just a damn Minion!

327
00:29:14,972 --> 00:29:16,337
This is a mutiny!

328
00:29:16,682 --> 00:29:18,092
Goddamn cockroach!

329
00:29:18,809 --> 00:29:21,266
Court martial him right away!

330
00:29:21,478 --> 00:29:23,343
How dare he point his gun
at chief of security!

331
00:29:23,522 --> 00:29:24,522
Director, you better go.

332
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:26,271
- He should be shot!
- Director Kim!

333
00:29:26,441 --> 00:29:28,056
It's a coup! A coup!

334
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:31,147
Who'd you think you're
pointing a gun at?

335
00:29:32,281 --> 00:29:34,647
He calls himself my senior!

336
00:29:35,033 --> 00:29:37,820
Let's barge into their hq
in namsan!

337
00:29:38,078 --> 00:29:40,034
And see if they can
still take us down!

338
00:29:42,249 --> 00:29:45,207
September 22, myeong-dong, Seoul.

339
00:30:26,668 --> 00:30:29,751
A New York times reporter
is staying at the Plaza hotel,

340
00:30:29,922 --> 00:30:33,255
so see if he conducts
an interview with governor Kim.

341
00:31:17,469 --> 00:31:19,334
Traitor of the revolution
by yong-gak park.

342
00:31:31,817 --> 00:31:36,311
Governor Kim had an interview
with a New York times reporter.

343
00:31:36,697 --> 00:31:40,406
- What did he say?
- He demanded that usa use official and

344
00:31:40,575 --> 00:31:42,941
direct pressure to control you.

345
00:31:43,286 --> 00:31:44,286
What?

346
00:31:44,454 --> 00:31:46,574
It'll be on the front page
of New York times tomorrow.

347
00:31:46,707 --> 00:31:48,789
- Did you know?
- Yes, sir.

348
00:31:54,047 --> 00:31:55,833
What should we do?

349
00:31:56,049 --> 00:31:59,758
This is a clear act of hostility.

350
00:31:59,928 --> 00:32:02,419
You must expel the governor at once.

351
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:06,758
If you did that for
doing an interview,

352
00:32:06,935 --> 00:32:08,675
usa won't stay put.

353
00:32:09,521 --> 00:32:12,433
Are you a kcia director
or a CIA director?

354
00:32:12,816 --> 00:32:15,102
If you like usa that much,
go and join CIA.

355
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:18,352
If you expel governor Kim,

356
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:22,276
the public will not remain calm.

357
00:32:26,288 --> 00:32:29,075
Security commander is requesting
an immediate audience.

358
00:32:29,624 --> 00:32:30,864
Let him in.

359
00:33:27,974 --> 00:33:33,719
Ex-kcia director's memoir unveiled,
debunking president park's myths

360
00:33:37,234 --> 00:33:38,690
am I insane?!

361
00:33:38,985 --> 00:33:40,316
Why'd I dig my own grave?!

362
00:33:40,487 --> 00:33:44,025
You should've buried
or burned the memoir!

363
00:33:44,199 --> 00:33:45,439
Why didn't you?!

364
00:33:45,617 --> 00:33:46,652
I got rid of it!

365
00:33:46,827 --> 00:33:51,366
Only FBI and kcia dir. Kim
have a copy...

366
00:33:55,127 --> 00:33:57,118
Is Kim screwing me over?

367
00:33:57,295 --> 00:33:59,206
Why'd he do such a thing?

368
00:34:01,216 --> 00:34:05,960
Secret is your upper hand,
how could you just open up?

369
00:34:06,179 --> 00:34:09,546
There's no secret in that book.

370
00:34:09,724 --> 00:34:11,055
I'm a bad guy,

371
00:34:12,561 --> 00:34:15,724
they're bad too, everyone's bad.

372
00:34:17,023 --> 00:34:18,559
There's no secrel.

373
00:34:18,859 --> 00:34:22,101
There's only one message
to that memoir,

374
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,278
let's all die,

375
00:34:25,490 --> 00:34:28,482
I'm not going down alone,
let's all diel

376
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:34,286
no secret in it!

377
00:34:38,795 --> 00:34:41,161
Goddammit! There is no secret.

378
00:34:45,051 --> 00:34:49,294
When will I ever go back home?

379
00:34:51,266 --> 00:34:53,632
When will the days of
those bastards end?

380
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:56,142
Will the world change?

381
00:34:58,398 --> 00:34:59,854
Only in its name.

382
00:35:00,984 --> 00:35:02,975
Speaking of that,

383
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:17,327
If the president's pushed out,
who'd have America's back?

384
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:20,417
They won't trust a soldier again.

385
00:35:20,587 --> 00:35:23,203
But they have a relationship
with gyu-pyeong.

386
00:35:23,381 --> 00:35:25,918
And gwak is a useless prick.

387
00:35:27,636 --> 00:35:29,501
At least they can
talk civilly with him.

388
00:35:30,096 --> 00:35:32,132
Will he do well?

389
00:35:32,474 --> 00:35:33,474
About what?

390
00:35:38,438 --> 00:35:41,100
You're up to something.

391
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:45,942
You think it's a bad idea?

392
00:35:51,076 --> 00:35:54,910
Gyu-pyeong won't last long,
he has to wake up.

393
00:35:56,706 --> 00:35:59,664
The president doesn't
let his number two alive.

394
00:36:01,503 --> 00:36:02,913
There is only one sun.

395
00:36:03,088 --> 00:36:07,047
Councilor Kim opposes the third
constitutional amendment?

396
00:36:07,425 --> 00:36:08,505
Yes, sir.

397
00:36:09,678 --> 00:36:13,717
A considerable number
of councilors are backing him.

398
00:36:16,268 --> 00:36:17,758
What do you recommend?

399
00:36:19,729 --> 00:36:21,640
I'll only follow your order.

400
00:36:24,734 --> 00:36:28,022
You have my full support.

401
00:36:30,573 --> 00:36:32,905
Do as you please.

402
00:36:52,929 --> 00:36:55,420
Good work with
the third amendment.

403
00:36:55,890 --> 00:36:57,551
Thank you, sir.

404
00:36:59,978 --> 00:37:01,718
Why don't you take a break?

405
00:37:03,773 --> 00:37:05,263
It looks bad in the media.

406
00:37:05,483 --> 00:37:07,474
Both parties are going nuts.

407
00:37:10,447 --> 00:37:11,983
You should've gone easy.

408
00:37:12,991 --> 00:37:15,698
Sir, but councilor Kim...

409
00:37:15,869 --> 00:37:17,075
Why?

410
00:37:17,912 --> 00:37:20,824
Why are you making me
look like a bad guy again?

411
00:37:22,375 --> 00:37:25,708
Did you think you'd be safe
after beating a man like that?

412
00:37:29,049 --> 00:37:33,759
Sir, I did my best for you.

413
00:37:35,055 --> 00:37:36,716
Are you buying up lands?

414
00:37:38,266 --> 00:37:39,266
Pardon?

415
00:37:39,476 --> 00:37:41,842
I heard you're buying up lands
in this small country.

416
00:37:43,813 --> 00:37:45,599
Leave the moneybag and go home.

417
00:37:46,024 --> 00:37:47,685
Stay home until I call you.

418
00:37:49,402 --> 00:37:50,482
Mr. president!

419
00:37:52,655 --> 00:37:56,443
I, yong-gak park, have
never had any money issue.

420
00:37:56,701 --> 00:38:01,286
I swear I wasn't blinded
by selfish interests!

421
00:38:01,456 --> 00:38:02,696
Cough it all out.

422
00:38:02,874 --> 00:38:05,206
Don't get yourself killed
for being greedy.

423
00:38:06,461 --> 00:38:08,497
Mr. president! Sir!

424
00:38:10,006 --> 00:38:11,086
Your excellency!

425
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:13,050
Sirl

426
00:38:13,301 --> 00:38:14,301
sirl.

427
00:38:22,352 --> 00:38:25,219
September 26, kcia hq in namsan.

428
00:38:37,659 --> 00:38:42,619
Sir, the professor who trained
wiretapping to security division,

429
00:38:42,789 --> 00:38:44,700
he was in Washington.

430
00:38:44,874 --> 00:38:48,287
He wiretapped director park there.

431
00:38:53,174 --> 00:38:54,960
He's downstairs.

432
00:39:02,851 --> 00:39:06,059
You studied at a good school,
prof. Lim.

433
00:39:07,355 --> 00:39:09,095
I'm just a freelancer.

434
00:39:09,274 --> 00:39:13,813
I was told you wiretapped
kcia ex-dir. Park in Washington.

435
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:27,451
This is the kcia.

436
00:39:28,751 --> 00:39:29,911
All right,

437
00:39:31,796 --> 00:39:33,582
consider yourself dead,

438
00:39:33,756 --> 00:39:35,587
and spill everything you know.

439
00:39:38,595 --> 00:39:42,759
I met a kcia agent there.

440
00:39:45,643 --> 00:39:49,886
James ryu was posing
as an exporter.

441
00:39:51,065 --> 00:39:53,898
I found him visiting
the embassy often.

442
00:39:54,068 --> 00:39:58,311
And this kcia agent ryu
hired you to wiretap park?

443
00:39:59,365 --> 00:40:00,445
Yes.

444
00:40:02,035 --> 00:40:06,904
When I returned, I got a call
from the security division.

445
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:12,368
I was hired to wiretap you.

446
00:40:13,254 --> 00:40:14,289
Me?

447
00:40:16,174 --> 00:40:17,289
Bug me?

448
00:40:26,559 --> 00:40:30,222
I found out who scouted
prof. Lim in America.

449
00:40:30,939 --> 00:40:33,772
James ryu,
Korean name is dong-hoon yoo.

450
00:40:33,942 --> 00:40:36,024
He's at the Paris embassy now.

451
00:40:36,402 --> 00:40:40,736
A kcia agent acted without my order.

452
00:40:43,034 --> 00:40:44,570
Who gave him an order?

453
00:40:44,744 --> 00:40:48,657
When yoo was in the airborne,
he was gwak's aide.

454
00:40:48,831 --> 00:40:49,831
Dong-hoon yoo

455
00:40:49,999 --> 00:40:52,786
gwak was the one who
recommended him to kcia.

456
00:40:55,922 --> 00:40:58,129
Send agent ham to Paris.

457
00:40:59,759 --> 00:41:02,341
September 29, Paris, France

458
00:41:06,057 --> 00:41:08,048
then in the hotel?

459
00:41:08,226 --> 00:41:12,219
Best thing is to bring him
to koreaq.

460
00:41:18,444 --> 00:41:21,652
Ambassador tae-ho yoon
it's a little difficult here.

461
00:41:22,782 --> 00:41:25,774
Kcia agent dong-hoon yoo.

462
00:41:45,388 --> 00:41:47,595
He'll drag me down?

463
00:41:49,309 --> 00:41:52,642
He's in close contact
with the Americans.

464
00:41:55,356 --> 00:41:59,440
Is park so desperate to die?

465
00:42:01,487 --> 00:42:02,487
Mr. president.

466
00:42:03,323 --> 00:42:06,281
Should we eliminate him?

467
00:42:20,548 --> 00:42:23,415
Sir, I have something to tell you.

468
00:42:24,969 --> 00:42:26,209
Idiot...

469
00:42:33,186 --> 00:42:36,178
October 1, Korean embassy in Paris

470
00:42:39,567 --> 00:42:41,432
- have you had lunch?
- Yes.

471
00:43:15,353 --> 00:43:19,312
Sir, ambassador yoon has
invited park to Paris.

472
00:43:20,817 --> 00:43:24,526
Tell yoon to carry out the plan.

473
00:43:27,532 --> 00:43:32,026
October 2, speaker of the house
welcome party.

474
00:44:06,863 --> 00:44:08,899
Director, good to see you.

475
00:44:09,657 --> 00:44:11,397
General chun!

476
00:44:12,910 --> 00:44:14,150
Come greet him.

477
00:44:17,957 --> 00:44:19,117
This is...

478
00:44:31,429 --> 00:44:34,341
Us embassy is on
the best site in Korea.

479
00:44:35,308 --> 00:44:38,596
Just feel that air.

480
00:44:39,687 --> 00:44:40,767
Right?

481
00:44:42,190 --> 00:44:44,977
Park heard from a feng shui
friend in Hong Kong,

482
00:44:45,526 --> 00:44:47,687
the blue house is on the
most omnious site in Korea.

483
00:44:47,862 --> 00:44:50,649
Which is why the owner
can't get out of there alive.

484
00:44:51,866 --> 00:44:55,654
Dragging him out
is best for the owner too.

485
00:44:59,707 --> 00:45:02,244
Park says he can't
wait any longer.

486
00:45:03,377 --> 00:45:04,958
What does he mean?

487
00:45:07,590 --> 00:45:09,876
He wants to do it.

488
00:45:10,468 --> 00:45:13,130
He says it's time
for a new owner.

489
00:45:17,141 --> 00:45:18,426
Are you nuts?

490
00:45:19,310 --> 00:45:21,016
You already know,

491
00:45:21,896 --> 00:45:24,012
it's just a matter of time.

492
00:45:24,232 --> 00:45:27,440
No one in this room
has not thought about it.

493
00:45:27,610 --> 00:45:31,523
Who'll pull out the sword first,
who'll cross han river first?

494
00:45:31,697 --> 00:45:33,983
Who'll plant the flag first?

495
00:45:35,785 --> 00:45:37,776
You have a nice dream.

496
00:45:38,412 --> 00:45:41,870
It may be a dream to park,
but not to you.

497
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:52,503
Do you think I'd send you
to the lion den on your own?

498
00:46:58,159 --> 00:47:00,901
The ambassador has
invited park to Paris.

499
00:47:01,370 --> 00:47:02,450
Yoon?

500
00:47:02,663 --> 00:47:03,663
Yes.

501
00:47:04,123 --> 00:47:07,707
He has also invited the former
prime minister hwang in Tokyo.

502
00:47:08,210 --> 00:47:09,825
Hwang's coming?

503
00:47:10,004 --> 00:47:11,119
Yes.

504
00:47:11,464 --> 00:47:15,924
He and yoo are taking orders
from gwak.

505
00:47:18,429 --> 00:47:23,844
Watch closely and see what
yoo and yoon are conspiring.

506
00:47:24,435 --> 00:47:25,470
I will, sir.

507
00:47:38,366 --> 00:47:41,608
October 4, place vendome, Paris.

508
00:48:01,847 --> 00:48:03,462
Director park!

509
00:48:06,310 --> 00:48:07,641
It's been too long!

510
00:48:08,312 --> 00:48:09,312
You look tired.

511
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:12,643
Let's catch up for
the lost time, come on.

512
00:48:13,901 --> 00:48:16,563
Hwang is flying in
from Tokyo for you,

513
00:48:16,737 --> 00:48:19,524
it's best to resolve this
through him.

514
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:28,864
So I should kneel
and beg to hwang?!

515
00:48:30,418 --> 00:48:34,002
The president said to hwang,
“I gave up!

516
00:48:34,922 --> 00:48:38,710
I don't wanna fight with park
anymore, just bring him in.”

517
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:44,049
He'll forgive you
if you return his money.

518
00:48:44,265 --> 00:48:45,380
What money?

519
00:48:46,350 --> 00:48:49,342
What money did I take?

520
00:48:59,030 --> 00:49:00,736
Did he really say that?

521
00:49:00,948 --> 00:49:02,438
Do this right.

522
00:49:04,577 --> 00:49:08,695
The president listens to hwang,
you know that.

523
00:49:15,337 --> 00:49:17,123
You sure director Kim
is getting fired?

524
00:49:17,298 --> 00:49:18,298
Yes.

525
00:49:19,091 --> 00:49:21,958
He's barely holding on
because of you.

526
00:49:22,636 --> 00:49:25,469
He couldn't even attend
the morning assembly.

527
00:49:25,681 --> 00:49:27,421
Gwak pushed him out!

528
00:49:44,992 --> 00:49:49,110
The one managing president's
Swiss bank account is lago.

529
00:49:49,622 --> 00:49:54,707
This man blindsided us, kcia
and got on top.

530
00:49:55,002 --> 00:49:56,492
Give me a reliable source.

531
00:49:56,712 --> 00:49:59,875
CIA has been digging into
the president's money trail,

532
00:50:00,049 --> 00:50:02,506
they found out that
he's been funneling

533
00:50:02,676 --> 00:50:05,634
money into Swiss accounts,
and slush funds without kcia.

534
00:50:13,604 --> 00:50:18,394
Sir, yoo obtained guns
through his Israeli contact.

535
00:50:18,859 --> 00:50:24,320
As you said, gwak may be
planning to assassinate park.

536
00:50:25,783 --> 00:50:27,489
How should I proceed?

537
00:50:28,869 --> 00:50:30,029
Director?

538
00:50:30,496 --> 00:50:31,702
Yeah...

539
00:50:38,838 --> 00:50:39,838
Mr. president.

540
00:50:40,381 --> 00:50:43,965
You and I are the only ones
working late.

541
00:50:50,182 --> 00:50:54,346
I'm feeling lonesome, a drink?

542
00:51:11,912 --> 00:51:13,197
Gyu-pyeond.

543
00:51:14,081 --> 00:51:15,662
Yes, sir.

544
00:51:20,045 --> 00:51:22,127
When do you think I'm done?

545
00:51:27,094 --> 00:51:31,713
It's not like I'll live
thousands of years.

546
00:51:41,525 --> 00:51:43,686
Who should be my successor?

547
00:51:50,075 --> 00:51:51,485
You should be it.

548
00:51:59,877 --> 00:52:01,538
Why? Not feeling it?

549
00:52:06,926 --> 00:52:11,295
I will always stand by you.

550
00:52:18,646 --> 00:52:21,183
What will you do with park?

551
00:52:26,695 --> 00:52:27,855
Sir,

552
00:52:29,490 --> 00:52:33,733
what would you like me to do?

553
00:52:42,419 --> 00:52:44,705
You have my full support.

554
00:52:47,216 --> 00:52:49,002
Do as you please.

555
00:53:42,646 --> 00:53:47,015
Traitor of the revolution
by yong-gak park.

556
00:53:58,120 --> 00:54:02,033
Sir, I got 3 Algerian killers
on standby.

557
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,865
Where's park?

558
00:54:05,085 --> 00:54:06,950
He's at the hotel.

559
00:54:08,047 --> 00:54:11,255
Deborah shim is arriving soon.

560
00:54:13,427 --> 00:54:15,588
What's your order, sir?

561
00:54:20,768 --> 00:54:24,477
October 7, Paris
Charles de gaulle airport.

562
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:34,770
Where's park?

563
00:54:35,074 --> 00:54:36,405
He's in the casino.

564
00:54:36,867 --> 00:54:41,361
It's good for park that
Kim's on his side.

565
00:54:41,997 --> 00:54:44,704
18-year dictatorship is over.

566
00:54:56,303 --> 00:54:58,669
You want me to lure park?

567
00:55:02,059 --> 00:55:05,551
Kim wanted me to tell park
that I got his full support.

568
00:55:05,854 --> 00:55:08,846
What the hell is he doing?

569
00:55:09,650 --> 00:55:11,060
Kim is an asshole.

570
00:55:11,235 --> 00:55:12,691
Watch your mouth.

571
00:55:14,154 --> 00:55:18,864
You should've told me earlier
this is how it's gonna play out.

572
00:55:19,159 --> 00:55:22,117
This isn't funny.
Kcia's bad at their job?

573
00:55:22,329 --> 00:55:25,116
Would you have come
to Paris then?

574
00:55:27,042 --> 00:55:30,705
I don't know why
I agreed to this.

575
00:55:30,879 --> 00:55:35,248
You can go back to D.C. now,
but you'll never return to Seoul.

576
00:55:35,426 --> 00:55:37,041
Are you threatening me?!

577
00:55:37,219 --> 00:55:42,304
It's your choice,
but you must choose one.

578
00:55:45,978 --> 00:55:47,263
Goddammit!

579
00:56:03,912 --> 00:56:07,154
Seoul arts theatre

580
00:56:21,847 --> 00:56:26,762
17th anniversary performance of
children's dance company.

581
00:57:12,898 --> 00:57:17,062
Yoon will bring park
to suite 407.

582
00:57:33,085 --> 00:57:35,121
Where's prime minister hwang?

583
00:57:35,504 --> 00:57:38,166
His flight got delayed
due to strong wind.

584
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:40,626
We'll meet here when he arrives.

585
00:57:40,801 --> 00:57:43,463
- Here?
- Upstairs, suite 407.

586
00:58:10,372 --> 00:58:13,910
I'll go to the front desk
and see if hwang checked in.

587
00:58:28,724 --> 00:58:30,510
I told you not to bet it all.

588
00:58:33,228 --> 00:58:35,014
I'm getting great hands.

589
00:58:35,188 --> 00:58:37,395
I might go big today.

590
00:58:50,871 --> 00:58:53,613
What brings you here to France?

591
00:58:56,501 --> 00:58:58,742
I came with Johnson.

592
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:01,206
Take park to suite 407.

593
00:59:06,470 --> 00:59:08,256
Director Kim wants you to wait.

594
00:59:09,181 --> 00:59:10,637
Gyu-pyeong?

595
00:59:11,183 --> 00:59:12,673
Heard he's been abandoned.

596
00:59:12,851 --> 00:59:14,057
What?

597
00:59:14,561 --> 00:59:17,553
Us councilors I went with
all had meetings only with him.

598
00:59:22,194 --> 00:59:23,730
Ambassador yoon, you bastard...

599
00:59:23,904 --> 00:59:24,904
What?

600
00:59:29,326 --> 00:59:31,362
Gyu-pyeong will do it?

601
00:59:32,579 --> 00:59:36,868
A few councilors and Johnson
are at a nearby diner.

602
00:59:37,084 --> 00:59:38,084
What?

603
00:59:38,585 --> 00:59:41,827
Let's go say hello,
we need our own plan.

604
00:59:42,089 --> 00:59:44,080
And change your reputation.

605
00:59:44,257 --> 00:59:47,124
The councilors really hate you.

606
00:59:47,386 --> 00:59:50,128
Korean politicians hate me too.

607
00:59:53,850 --> 00:59:54,965
Excuse us.

608
01:00:09,366 --> 01:00:13,359
How did you know I was here?

609
01:00:14,037 --> 01:00:15,777
Director Kim told me.

610
01:00:20,627 --> 01:00:22,618
How did he know?

611
01:00:44,317 --> 01:00:45,932
Aren't we walking?

612
01:00:46,820 --> 01:00:48,981
I got high heels on.

613
01:01:02,627 --> 01:01:04,163
I'm sorry, we lost him.

614
01:01:04,379 --> 01:01:06,791
I think someone else intervened.

615
01:01:24,024 --> 01:01:26,060
- Oh no, my hat!
- What is it?

616
01:01:31,114 --> 01:01:32,820
Such a strong wind.

617
01:01:39,873 --> 01:01:41,579
What the hell?!

618
01:04:05,310 --> 01:04:07,175
My nose, my nose!

619
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:10,721
He bit my nose!

620
01:06:55,230 --> 01:06:57,095
The operation is complete.

621
01:08:33,411 --> 01:08:36,653
October 18, blue house

622
01:08:37,832 --> 01:08:39,914
director Kim, your thoughts?

623
01:08:40,793 --> 01:08:43,500
You must reinstate governor Kim,

624
01:08:44,088 --> 01:08:45,874
make amend with
the opposition party.

625
01:08:46,049 --> 01:08:47,334
Director Kim!

626
01:08:47,717 --> 01:08:51,130
The rioters lit up police station,
screaming to overthrow us!

627
01:08:51,304 --> 01:08:53,511
That's a declaration of war!

628
01:08:53,723 --> 01:08:57,636
Sir, they're not citizens anymore,
they're rioters.

629
01:08:58,186 --> 01:08:59,551
Declare martial law in busan.

630
01:08:59,729 --> 01:09:03,938
If you do that, the riot could
spread to nearby cities.

631
01:09:04,108 --> 01:09:06,770
Run them over with tanks,
it's all over.

632
01:09:09,155 --> 01:09:11,995
Disturbance in busan, fire linked to riot
army chief of staff, thoughts?

633
01:09:12,784 --> 01:09:16,072
Army chief of staff seung-ho Chang.

634
01:09:21,376 --> 01:09:22,912
What am I supposed to do?

635
01:09:23,836 --> 01:09:29,706
If we send in an airborne brigade,
we can suppress it immediately.

636
01:09:30,009 --> 01:09:32,421
Sir, you can't declare martial law.

637
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:35,132
Let's control it with the airborne.

638
01:09:46,150 --> 01:09:48,186
Declare martial law.

639
01:10:05,336 --> 01:10:08,669
Park went missing?

640
01:10:10,341 --> 01:10:12,127
He will not be found.

641
01:10:16,764 --> 01:10:19,255
I'll go meet governor Kim.

642
01:10:19,559 --> 01:10:21,390
Please lift the martial law.

643
01:10:22,729 --> 01:10:25,516
If we can't find him,
what about the money he took?

644
01:10:28,067 --> 01:10:29,067
Pardon?

645
01:10:29,235 --> 01:10:31,817
I don't care if he's missing or not.

646
01:10:33,531 --> 01:10:35,772
He's a traitor anyway.

647
01:10:37,910 --> 01:10:40,822
I buried him a long time ago,

648
01:10:41,581 --> 01:10:43,663
just bring back
the money he took.

649
01:10:46,502 --> 01:10:51,997
Aside from some he embezzled,
there's nothing much...

650
01:10:55,053 --> 01:10:59,296
Sir, it'll get messy from now on.

651
01:10:59,474 --> 01:11:00,964
Usa will not stay put.

652
01:11:01,142 --> 01:11:05,385
I'll make this go away,
but I need your cooperation.

653
01:11:05,563 --> 01:11:06,894
Cooperation?

654
01:11:08,066 --> 01:11:09,431
Kim,

655
01:11:11,444 --> 01:11:13,150
are you threatening me?

656
01:11:16,157 --> 01:11:21,277
If you want to threaten me,
do so with something enticing.

657
01:11:21,871 --> 01:11:23,657
What's with you lately?

658
01:11:24,499 --> 01:11:28,458
Just get me what I asked for.

659
01:11:45,436 --> 01:11:47,017
Where's gwak?

660
01:11:47,814 --> 01:11:48,894
Yes, Mr. president.

661
01:13:33,794 --> 01:13:38,208
Director, there's an event
tonight at our safe house.

662
01:13:44,472 --> 01:13:45,712
Head there then.

663
01:13:45,890 --> 01:13:49,132
The president only invited gwak.

664
01:13:50,770 --> 01:13:52,431
He didn't invite me?

665
01:13:53,189 --> 01:13:54,189
No, sir.

666
01:15:24,572 --> 01:15:29,692
The pressure to supply
color TV is immense.

667
01:15:33,497 --> 01:15:36,079
Do you want our people
to see me in color?

668
01:15:37,460 --> 01:15:40,202
I like black and white.

669
01:15:42,757 --> 01:15:45,920
You look better
in black and white!

670
01:16:37,770 --> 01:16:42,309
They say Kim is next in line, and
he communicates well in english.

671
01:16:45,778 --> 01:16:50,238
Any news from busan?

672
01:16:50,950 --> 01:16:54,943
I took care of the evidence
for the connection with

673
01:16:55,121 --> 01:16:57,908
the north and the opposition party.

674
01:16:59,375 --> 01:17:01,912
What is the matter with Kim?

675
01:17:03,129 --> 01:17:07,247
Did you see him glare at me
at the mention of airborne?

676
01:17:08,300 --> 01:17:10,256
It's a state of emergency.

677
01:17:11,637 --> 01:17:14,845
Why is he so foolish?

678
01:17:15,224 --> 01:17:20,059
Sir, Kim is done.

679
01:17:22,606 --> 01:17:23,606
Yes?

680
01:17:29,113 --> 01:17:30,193
Okay.

681
01:17:30,489 --> 01:17:33,401
The rioters in busan
are going mad.

682
01:17:33,576 --> 01:17:35,282
They even lit up a TV station.

683
01:17:35,453 --> 01:17:37,819
I'll go make a call.

684
01:17:59,185 --> 01:18:05,306
Only moonlight shines

685
01:18:07,359 --> 01:18:09,520
on the land

686
01:18:12,740 --> 01:18:16,983
of the fallen kingdom

687
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:27,543
it expresses futility

688
01:18:29,882 --> 01:18:34,342
of this world.

689
01:18:40,684 --> 01:18:45,178
Oh, you poor thing

690
01:18:46,941 --> 01:18:54,941
as I search aimlessly.

691
01:19:00,204 --> 01:19:01,660
For...

692
01:19:48,252 --> 01:19:49,412
Yes.

693
01:19:51,213 --> 01:19:52,373
What?

694
01:19:54,758 --> 01:19:56,623
What did they say?

695
01:20:00,514 --> 01:20:02,004
I'm over?

696
01:20:03,309 --> 01:20:05,516
Did that yank really say that?

697
01:20:07,062 --> 01:20:09,018
What did Kim say?

698
01:20:11,650 --> 01:20:14,141
That bastard is the same!

699
01:20:15,487 --> 01:20:18,354
What can he do by
siding with the Americans?

700
01:20:18,991 --> 01:20:23,610
If he loves democracy so much,
tell him to go and live in usa.

701
01:20:23,787 --> 01:20:26,119
He even killed his own friend.

702
01:20:27,333 --> 01:20:29,574
How can I trust him
to be by my side?

703
01:20:30,544 --> 01:20:32,455
Son of a bitch...

704
01:20:33,380 --> 01:20:36,964
What do you think
I should do with Kim?

705
01:20:44,475 --> 01:20:46,591
You have my full support.

706
01:20:47,811 --> 01:20:50,177
Do as you please.

707
01:21:20,803 --> 01:21:22,885
He even killed his own friend.

708
01:21:23,055 --> 01:21:25,592
How can I trust him
to be by my side?

709
01:21:26,767 --> 01:21:28,507
Son of a bitch...

710
01:21:29,228 --> 01:21:32,470
What do you think
I should do with Kim?

711
01:21:34,233 --> 01:21:36,349
You have my full support.

712
01:21:37,611 --> 01:21:40,193
Do as you please.

713
01:21:58,090 --> 01:21:59,205
Director.

714
01:22:06,515 --> 01:22:08,676
Your attention is needed
in busan, sir.

715
01:22:09,601 --> 01:22:11,683
The situation is grave.

716
01:22:12,813 --> 01:22:16,021
October 24, busan

717
01:22:18,652 --> 01:22:20,984
the rioters have taken over
the TV station!

718
01:22:22,031 --> 01:22:24,738
The riot is quickly
spreading out to masan,

719
01:22:24,908 --> 01:22:26,614
from students and regular citizens,

720
01:22:26,994 --> 01:22:30,612
it's like the uprising that
toppled president Lee's regime.

721
01:22:50,768 --> 01:22:54,727
It may be a dream to park,
but not to you.

722
01:22:56,065 --> 01:22:58,272
Why did we go through
with the revolution?

723
01:22:58,442 --> 01:23:01,809
Why did we risk our lives?

724
01:23:46,698 --> 01:23:50,065
You were in busan? How was it?

725
01:23:52,663 --> 01:23:55,029
They were just students
and citizens, sir.

726
01:23:55,374 --> 01:23:59,959
They burned down a station,
they're no regular citizens.

727
01:24:00,129 --> 01:24:02,245
Intimidation will not work.

728
01:24:02,548 --> 01:24:03,548
Intimidation?

729
01:24:03,674 --> 01:24:05,630
Reinstate the governor,

730
01:24:06,385 --> 01:24:08,751
and work things out
with the congress.

731
01:24:12,099 --> 01:24:15,762
Did I threaten the citizens?

732
01:24:16,186 --> 01:24:17,596
Mr. president.

733
01:24:17,980 --> 01:24:19,971
Take a broad outlook
in the politics.

734
01:24:21,692 --> 01:24:23,728
Busan and masan aren't islands.

735
01:24:23,986 --> 01:24:25,977
The situation could spread to Seoul.

736
01:24:26,155 --> 01:24:28,396
I put you in your position
to stop that.

737
01:24:28,574 --> 01:24:30,781
How can we stop a forest fire?

738
01:24:31,535 --> 01:24:34,368
The forest must
burn down for it to die.

739
01:24:37,249 --> 01:24:38,409
Hey you!

740
01:24:38,667 --> 01:24:42,330
How come a kcia director
cannot even contain a small riot?!

741
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:44,586
Before the commies spread,

742
01:24:44,798 --> 01:24:47,084
we must take special measures!

743
01:24:47,676 --> 01:24:51,919
You know, in Cambodia
they sacrificed 3 million people,

744
01:24:52,097 --> 01:24:55,510
killing a million or 2
with tanks is nothing!

745
01:24:57,227 --> 01:24:58,637
Gwak is right.

746
01:24:59,980 --> 01:25:04,314
In the days of liberals,
generals got executed

747
01:25:04,484 --> 01:25:06,270
for opening fire to the rioters.

748
01:25:08,906 --> 01:25:13,275
But if I order to open fire,

749
01:25:15,162 --> 01:25:17,824
who will execute me?

750
01:25:20,626 --> 01:25:23,834
- So?
- Sirl you are absolutely right!

751
01:25:26,632 --> 01:25:28,247
Isn't that right, general chun?

752
01:25:29,885 --> 01:25:30,885
Absolutely.

753
01:25:31,261 --> 01:25:35,300
All settled, let's move to
the sapgyo river ceremony.

754
01:26:14,388 --> 01:26:15,924
He wants you to stay put!

755
01:26:16,515 --> 01:26:17,971
There's no room for you!

756
01:27:32,049 --> 01:27:36,634
We should cancel the unveiling
ceremony of sir an jung-geun statue.

757
01:27:37,888 --> 01:27:38,923
Why?

758
01:27:39,222 --> 01:27:41,258
There's a crack in the statue.

759
01:27:41,433 --> 01:27:43,094
Blue house

760
01:27:45,145 --> 01:27:46,180
yes, Mr. president.

761
01:27:46,438 --> 01:27:51,307
There's an event tonight at 6,
so you should attend.

762
01:27:52,778 --> 01:27:55,770
Grab some commies and
tie them to the busan riot.

763
01:27:55,989 --> 01:27:57,695
We'll run them over with tanks.

764
01:27:57,949 --> 01:27:59,109
Do it right!

765
01:28:20,347 --> 01:28:22,463
Get the chief of staff.

766
01:28:24,393 --> 01:28:25,849
Right away, sir.

767
01:28:34,694 --> 01:28:39,108
October 26, 1979
presidential safehouse.

768
01:28:51,711 --> 01:28:53,417
Moving to b wing.

769
01:28:54,047 --> 01:28:57,005
Vip and 2 envoy cars confirmed.

770
01:29:54,107 --> 01:29:56,940
Director Kim makes
the best cocktails.

771
01:29:58,445 --> 01:29:59,560
Indeed, sir.

772
01:30:00,280 --> 01:30:03,022
I'm good at being a bartender.

773
01:30:03,950 --> 01:30:06,908
Despite his vices,
he's good with drinks.

774
01:30:11,124 --> 01:30:12,239
Director Kim.

775
01:30:13,043 --> 01:30:14,158
Yes, sir.

776
01:30:14,377 --> 01:30:19,371
I organized this night for you.

777
01:30:22,844 --> 01:30:23,844
Have a drink.

778
01:30:28,683 --> 01:30:31,220
Did you feel neglected?

779
01:30:34,439 --> 01:30:35,895
Come in.

780
01:30:47,160 --> 01:30:48,616
Wipe away that frown.

781
01:30:48,870 --> 01:30:50,326
Don't be so proud.

782
01:30:51,790 --> 01:30:52,790
Here.

783
01:31:09,808 --> 01:31:12,390
Chief of staff, I'm sorry.

784
01:31:12,852 --> 01:31:15,218
The president dropped by
all of sudden.

785
01:31:15,939 --> 01:31:17,645
Let's meet another day.

786
01:31:17,816 --> 01:31:18,896
No, not at all.

787
01:31:19,901 --> 01:31:23,189
I'll wrap it up quickly,
go have dinner first.

788
01:32:04,988 --> 01:32:07,946
When the nation
goes haywire, we all die.

789
01:32:08,450 --> 01:32:09,610
Brace yourself.

790
01:32:15,498 --> 01:32:16,988
Chief of staff is present.

791
01:32:17,375 --> 01:32:23,245
Once this is over, we take him
to namsan and take over the army.

792
01:32:23,423 --> 01:32:25,334
Will you include the president?

793
01:32:27,260 --> 01:32:28,625
We kill him tonight.

794
01:32:29,012 --> 01:32:31,003
The security is too tight tonight.

795
01:32:31,306 --> 01:32:32,842
- We should postpone.
- Nol!

796
01:32:34,809 --> 01:32:36,174
There will be a leak.

797
01:32:37,604 --> 01:32:40,937
Have a couple of
smart ones on standby.

798
01:33:05,715 --> 01:33:11,551
The castle has rundown,

799
01:33:13,014 --> 01:33:17,098
only the tall grass remain,

800
01:33:18,520 --> 01:33:26,520
depicting how futile
our lives are

801
01:33:30,532 --> 01:33:36,528
a lonesome stranger

802
01:33:37,622 --> 01:33:41,831
cannot fall asleep alone

803
01:33:42,877 --> 01:33:48,417
he Wells up al the sound of

804
01:33:49,634 --> 01:33:53,502
mournful crickets

805
01:33:56,182 --> 01:33:58,298
- good evening, sir.
- Hey.

806
01:33:59,602 --> 01:34:01,138
Did you have dinner?

807
01:34:01,438 --> 01:34:03,269
Yeah, go on, I had it already.

808
01:34:04,149 --> 01:34:05,309
Okay.

809
01:34:07,902 --> 01:34:09,358
The president doesn't eat much.

810
01:34:16,327 --> 01:34:18,067
It's so comfy coming here,

811
01:34:18,705 --> 01:34:21,162
kcia does all the security,
nothing to worry about.

812
01:34:22,584 --> 01:34:25,496
Sir, allow me
to pour you a drink.

813
01:34:25,962 --> 01:34:26,962
Sure.

814
01:34:40,435 --> 01:34:44,019
Do you remember
the night of revolution?

815
01:34:44,355 --> 01:34:48,724
You and I were half way
across the han river,

816
01:34:48,902 --> 01:34:52,394
and we saw mp police line.

817
01:34:52,655 --> 01:34:58,901
I followed you off the Jeep
and walked across the bridge...

818
01:34:59,078 --> 01:35:03,196
A bullet came flying.

819
01:35:04,375 --> 01:35:06,411
It was too dark to see anything.

820
01:35:06,586 --> 01:35:09,123
But we heard the bullet whiz by.

821
01:35:09,297 --> 01:35:11,879
You asked me then,

822
01:35:12,842 --> 01:35:15,254
“gen. Kim, what should we do?”

823
01:35:15,470 --> 01:35:18,633
“A man's path isn't
always filled with laughs,

824
01:35:19,933 --> 01:35:24,267
but a storm cannot stop a man
with determination.

825
01:35:24,896 --> 01:35:26,978
Sir, let's go!”

826
01:35:29,192 --> 01:35:30,192
That's what you said.

827
01:35:30,318 --> 01:35:33,481
He had balls back then,
but all shriveled up lately...

828
01:35:33,655 --> 01:35:40,743
Had we not crossed
that bridge...

829
01:35:41,579 --> 01:35:43,490
None of us would be here.

830
01:36:08,815 --> 01:36:11,807
Let's all drink for park,
who is not here today.

831
01:36:21,077 --> 01:36:23,113
You know the drill.

832
01:36:23,788 --> 01:36:26,279
We drink and become
one with the ghost.

833
01:36:27,083 --> 01:36:29,745
Park was one of us, no?

834
01:36:30,420 --> 01:36:31,580
Isn't that right, sir?

835
01:36:31,754 --> 01:36:33,870
You got a death wish?

836
01:36:34,048 --> 01:36:37,666
How could you govern with
this cockroach by your side?

837
01:36:38,720 --> 01:36:40,426
The country is in ruins.

838
01:36:40,597 --> 01:36:41,882
Kim, stop it!

839
01:36:42,056 --> 01:36:43,887
- What are you doing?
- Mr. president!

840
01:36:45,435 --> 01:36:48,768
You must step down at once.

841
01:36:49,147 --> 01:36:51,263
- Enough!
- Step down!

842
01:36:51,441 --> 01:36:52,441
You bastard!

843
01:36:52,609 --> 01:36:53,609
Sit down!

844
01:36:59,449 --> 01:37:00,529
Director Kim.

845
01:37:00,700 --> 01:37:03,157
Do you know why
I put you in your position?

846
01:37:06,414 --> 01:37:11,283
Trying to be almighty
after killing his friend?

847
01:37:12,211 --> 01:37:17,331
Do your damn job.

848
01:37:21,971 --> 01:37:23,131
Mr. president.

849
01:37:26,476 --> 01:37:28,933
Why did you carry out
the revolution?

850
01:37:31,022 --> 01:37:33,058
Why did we risk our lives!

851
01:37:34,442 --> 01:37:35,807
For revolution?

852
01:37:40,031 --> 01:37:44,900
Kill one or two million
citizens with tanks?

853
01:37:48,164 --> 01:37:49,529
Please, sir!

854
01:37:51,459 --> 01:37:53,415
Get it together!

855
01:37:54,420 --> 01:37:56,411
You're out of your mind!

856
01:37:57,131 --> 01:37:59,543
Know your place!

857
01:38:00,051 --> 01:38:01,051
What the hell?

858
01:38:02,428 --> 01:38:03,713
What are you doing?

859
01:38:05,515 --> 01:38:07,005
- You should die too!
- No, Kim!

860
01:38:09,143 --> 01:38:10,143
Nol

861
01:38:13,481 --> 01:38:14,481
sirl.

862
01:38:16,567 --> 01:38:17,773
Mr. president!

863
01:38:19,112 --> 01:38:20,192
Blood...

864
01:38:20,405 --> 01:38:21,440
Help!

865
01:38:24,492 --> 01:38:26,608
- Don't move!
- What are you doing?!

866
01:38:37,171 --> 01:38:38,171
Sirl

867
01:38:42,135 --> 01:38:44,421
help! Someone help!

868
01:38:48,182 --> 01:38:49,763
Bring me a gun! Now!

869
01:38:53,146 --> 01:38:54,386
Col. Kang!

870
01:38:55,231 --> 01:38:56,391
Col. Kang!

871
01:38:58,526 --> 01:38:59,936
Where are you?!

872
01:39:00,153 --> 01:39:01,153
Right here, sir!

873
01:39:01,529 --> 01:39:02,860
Gun! Give me a gun!

874
01:39:04,115 --> 01:39:05,525
- Guards?
- All dead.

875
01:39:05,700 --> 01:39:07,361
Why did the lights go off?!

876
01:39:14,083 --> 01:39:15,083
Security!

877
01:39:20,798 --> 01:39:21,798
Security!

878
01:39:41,110 --> 01:39:42,816
I'm okay...

879
01:39:48,284 --> 01:39:53,904
You're executed for being
a traitor of the revolution.

880
01:40:37,250 --> 01:40:38,250
Director!

881
01:40:45,133 --> 01:40:47,545
Sir, what do we do now?

882
01:40:50,847 --> 01:40:52,053
It's all over.

883
01:40:52,557 --> 01:40:56,596
I'll bring the chief of staff,
we're going back to namsan.

884
01:40:58,563 --> 01:40:59,928
C... clean it up.

885
01:41:02,525 --> 01:41:03,640
It's all over.

886
01:41:04,944 --> 01:41:06,104
It's all over.

887
01:41:56,078 --> 01:41:57,989
What's going on?

888
01:42:03,127 --> 01:42:06,244
The president was assassinated.

889
01:42:10,259 --> 01:42:12,250
What... how did it happen?

890
01:42:15,806 --> 01:42:16,886
Well...

891
01:42:31,739 --> 01:42:33,980
Did you see my shoes?

892
01:42:35,701 --> 01:42:37,817
I'm missing my shoes.

893
01:42:48,714 --> 01:42:51,626
Director, let's go to the army hq.

894
01:42:52,093 --> 01:42:53,629
Why go to namsan?

895
01:42:53,803 --> 01:42:56,886
We must declare martial law
at the army hq,

896
01:42:57,265 --> 01:42:59,347
and figure out
the north's movement.

897
01:43:01,227 --> 01:43:02,967
Go to the army hq.

898
01:43:05,398 --> 01:43:07,639
Director, where should we go?

899
01:43:09,568 --> 01:43:10,568
What?

900
01:43:10,903 --> 01:43:14,270
Kcia or army headquarters?

901
01:44:16,135 --> 01:44:24,053
Kim ultimately went to the army hq
and was arrested upon arrival.

902
01:44:26,771 --> 01:44:34,769
The military court sentenced him
to death by hanging.

Swiss bank account transactions

904
01:45:36,924 --> 01:45:41,588
47 days after the assassination,

905
01:45:41,804 --> 01:45:46,639
a new military coup took place,

906
01:45:46,851 --> 01:45:52,687
leading to another military dictatorship.

907
01:46:03,742 --> 01:46:06,859
According to
the joint investigation committee,

908
01:46:07,079 --> 01:46:09,411
Kim was discontent as he believed

909
01:46:09,623 --> 01:46:14,458
that the president distrusted him,
and only favored the chief of security.

910
01:46:14,670 --> 01:46:18,538
He feared his potential dismissal,

911
01:46:18,757 --> 01:46:24,047
relating to the disturbance
in busan and masan,

912
01:46:24,263 --> 01:46:27,255
and becoming delusional,

913
01:46:27,475 --> 01:46:31,218
committed the murder
of the president and the chief of security.

914
01:46:31,437 --> 01:46:35,897
This is a crime to create a disturbance,
driven by the vain desire

915
01:46:36,108 --> 01:46:39,225
of becoming the president.

916
01:46:44,617 --> 01:46:46,528
The goal of October 26 revolt

917
01:46:46,744 --> 01:46:51,113
was to restore democracy of Korea,
and to prevent even more sacrifices.

918
01:46:51,332 --> 01:46:55,291
I did not start the revolution
to become a president.

919
01:46:55,503 --> 01:46:58,165
I am a soldier and a revolutionist.

920
01:46:58,380 --> 01:47:06,380
I am not testifying here today
for any leniency.

921
01:47:15,147 --> 01:47:23,147
I wish for your honor to judge me
fairly with just sentence.

922
01:47:23,489 --> 01:47:26,026
This concludes my statement.
Thank you.
