1
00:02:25,563 --> 00:02:27,273
In the winter of 1930,...

2
00:02:27,482 --> 00:02:28,942
...after the failure...

3
00:02:29,192 --> 00:02:31,945
...of the antimonarchical
rebellion in Jaca,...

4
00:02:32,278 --> 00:02:34,823
...a young soldier
left his barracks and,...

5
00:02:35,156 --> 00:02:38,243
...as a deserter,
wandered the countryside,...

6
00:02:38,451 --> 00:02:40,411
...trying to lead
his own life.

7
00:02:41,871 --> 00:02:45,041
February, 1931.
Somewhere in Spain.

8
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:07,647
Halt!

9
00:03:09,107 --> 00:03:09,858
Hands up!

10
00:03:12,277 --> 00:03:13,528
I was just...

11
00:03:13,778 --> 00:03:14,654
Where are...

12
00:03:14,863 --> 00:03:15,738
you from?

13
00:03:16,281 --> 00:03:17,282
Madrid.

14
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:18,658
Where are you going?

15
00:03:19,701 --> 00:03:21,661
Answer the sergeant.

16
00:03:22,871 --> 00:03:25,248
- Where are you going?
- I don't know.

17
00:03:25,874 --> 00:03:26,749
You deserted?

18
00:03:29,794 --> 00:03:32,172
Long live Galin
and Garcia Hernandez!

19
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:33,548
He's with the Jaca lot.

20
00:03:33,798 --> 00:03:34,757
Hold it!

21
00:03:35,008 --> 00:03:36,467
Didn't you hear him?

22
00:03:38,303 --> 00:03:41,222
- Were you stationed in Jaca?
- No, sir.

23
00:03:41,431 --> 00:03:42,557
Well then?

24
00:03:44,809 --> 00:03:46,853
I support the Republic.

25
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:51,900
I don't understand this.
A Republican with the Bible.

26
00:04:24,015 --> 00:04:24,599
Wait!

27
00:04:26,351 --> 00:04:27,977
Shall we let him go?

28
00:04:29,562 --> 00:04:30,730
You're kidding!

29
00:04:31,189 --> 00:04:34,776
- What if the Republic wins?
- It's still the fatherland.

30
00:04:34,984 --> 00:04:36,945
The fatherland
is the government.

31
00:04:37,278 --> 00:04:39,030
And the government may change.

32
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,031
So?

33
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:44,244
The sooner we serve
the likely winner...

34
00:04:44,869 --> 00:04:45,912
...the better.

35
00:04:46,162 --> 00:04:48,623
We must respect
the established order.

36
00:04:48,873 --> 00:04:50,416
That's what the law says.

37
00:04:50,792 --> 00:04:53,127
And in the 1854 revolution,...

38
00:04:53,378 --> 00:04:56,214
...our founder,
the Marquis of Ahumada,...

39
00:04:56,464 --> 00:04:59,550
...was thrown out
for defending the government.

40
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:00,635
No way.

41
00:05:00,885 --> 00:05:04,514
The Civil Guard stay out
of politics. The chief says so.

42
00:05:04,889 --> 00:05:07,433
Yeah, and pigs can fly.

43
00:05:17,527 --> 00:05:19,487
Whoever invented tobacco...

44
00:05:19,821 --> 00:05:23,157
...should have been hung
on a meat hook,...

45
00:05:23,533 --> 00:05:25,368
...with a weight on his feet.

46
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:28,371
Health and the Republic.

47
00:05:30,707 --> 00:05:31,958
What are you doing?

48
00:05:33,209 --> 00:05:34,085
I'm free to go?

49
00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:34,961
Stop!

50
00:05:36,296 --> 00:05:39,090
Trust your father-in-law,
dammit!

51
00:05:39,716 --> 00:05:41,384
I'll be court-martialed!

52
00:05:41,801 --> 00:05:44,679
You certainly will be
if you don't put your gun down.

53
00:05:44,929 --> 00:05:47,056
Fuck it, Juan, I'll shoot!

54
00:05:47,515 --> 00:05:50,059
You'd shoot
your children's grandfather?

55
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:51,602
I'll do it!

56
00:05:53,438 --> 00:05:55,106
You haven't the balls.

57
00:05:55,356 --> 00:05:56,316
I don't?

58
00:05:59,152 --> 00:06:01,404
The bastard shot me!

59
00:06:05,241 --> 00:06:07,035
Don't shoot!

60
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:10,705
Can you hear me?

61
00:06:11,164 --> 00:06:12,332
Juan!

62
00:06:16,044 --> 00:06:17,295
I've killed him!

63
00:06:18,254 --> 00:06:19,714
I've killed him!

64
00:06:21,549 --> 00:06:22,800
And now what?

65
00:06:24,052 --> 00:06:26,512
What am I going
to tell my wife?

66
00:06:29,557 --> 00:06:31,309
I want to die!

67
00:06:32,268 --> 00:06:33,895
I want to die!

68
00:06:34,687 --> 00:06:36,064
I'll kill myself!

69
00:06:40,485 --> 00:06:42,945
That man was kindness itself.

70
00:06:43,696 --> 00:06:46,157
And it was all over nothing.

71
00:06:47,617 --> 00:06:49,577
It was all over nothing!

72
00:06:51,788 --> 00:06:54,165
Fuck all the laws!

73
00:06:54,582 --> 00:06:58,211
And fuck the goddam
public order!

74
00:06:58,419 --> 00:07:02,048
And the Marquis of Ahumada,
and the Holy Virgin as well!

75
00:08:26,674 --> 00:08:27,758
Good evening.

76
00:08:32,597 --> 00:08:33,431
Hey...

77
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,437
- Any whores here?
- Yeah, there's one.

78
00:08:40,313 --> 00:08:42,482
And she's terrific.

79
00:08:47,612 --> 00:08:49,071
And how much is it...

80
00:08:49,322 --> 00:08:50,281
...for the night?

81
00:08:50,615 --> 00:08:52,200
That's asking a lot.

82
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:54,494
Talk to Polonia.

83
00:08:54,702 --> 00:08:55,661
Upstairs.

84
00:08:56,412 --> 00:08:58,164
- Sixty.
- I pass.

85
00:08:59,624 --> 00:09:00,583
Eighty.

86
00:09:04,212 --> 00:09:05,171
May I come in?

87
00:09:06,714 --> 00:09:09,300
Why do you all keep
coming upstairs?

88
00:09:09,634 --> 00:09:11,594
I've told you not to.

89
00:09:12,428 --> 00:09:15,097
They told me
to ask for Polonia.

90
00:09:16,015 --> 00:09:17,391
What is it, son?

91
00:09:20,478 --> 00:09:22,730
How much is it
for the whole night?

92
00:09:23,272 --> 00:09:25,316
For handsome boys,
ten pesetas.

93
00:09:26,859 --> 00:09:29,820
But you'll have to wait
till after midnight.

94
00:09:30,071 --> 00:09:30,905
Why?

95
00:09:31,155 --> 00:09:34,534
Because We get customers
until then.

96
00:09:34,867 --> 00:09:36,702
- Come on.
- What time is it?

97
00:09:36,953 --> 00:09:39,497
- Are we playing or not?
- I'm coming.

98
00:09:39,705 --> 00:09:42,041
It's almost nine.
Have you eaten?

99
00:09:43,668 --> 00:09:47,129
You can have some rabbit
while you're waiting.

100
00:09:48,256 --> 00:09:52,134
My niece won't miss out on
a young man like you.

101
00:09:52,343 --> 00:09:54,220
Go on, sit down, love.

102
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:01,227
Where are you going?

103
00:10:01,978 --> 00:10:03,646
Make room for the boy!

104
00:10:09,402 --> 00:10:11,862
- Cold, isn't it?
- Well, it's winter.

105
00:10:12,405 --> 00:10:15,908
This just won't do.
Either we play or we don't.

106
00:10:16,117 --> 00:10:19,161
Excuse me.
Don Luis, an extreme unction.

107
00:10:21,998 --> 00:10:23,457
Just a minute.

108
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:27,169
- What about the game?
- I'm sorry, but you heard.

109
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:31,507
And as sheriff, I have
to accompany Don Luis.

110
00:10:31,716 --> 00:10:34,760
I don't believe it, Don Luis.
You in a brothel!

111
00:10:35,011 --> 00:10:38,848
Precisely. Where there is sin,
that's where I must be.

112
00:10:39,724 --> 00:10:43,060
- Why did you bring Holy Joe?
- He came along.

113
00:10:43,394 --> 00:10:45,187
Who's dying anyway?

114
00:10:45,563 --> 00:10:48,649
Prudencio. The mule kicked
his brains out.

115
00:10:48,858 --> 00:10:50,610
Man's days are numbered.

116
00:10:52,361 --> 00:10:56,490
It'd make you believe in God.
When the priest's winning...

117
00:10:56,949 --> 00:10:59,452
...Divine Providence sends
a viaticum,...

118
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,203
...and he splits
with the money.

119
00:11:01,954 --> 00:11:02,997
Extreme unction.

120
00:11:03,331 --> 00:11:05,791
What's the difference?

121
00:11:06,167 --> 00:11:08,210
Viaticum is giving
the Eucharist.

122
00:11:08,461 --> 00:11:11,213
Extreme unction is applying
holy oils.

123
00:11:11,547 --> 00:11:11,922
Here.

124
00:11:13,257 --> 00:11:14,008
Wet your whistle.

125
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,720
He knows a lot
about the Church.

126
00:11:18,054 --> 00:11:20,306
Maybe he can play cards.

127
00:11:21,641 --> 00:11:23,100
Well, sort of.

128
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,312
All the better for us.
Come on.

129
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:28,731
Eat up and we'll play.

130
00:11:29,774 --> 00:11:31,651
What the hell's that?

131
00:11:31,901 --> 00:11:35,237
- What did you do, you rascal?
- Nothing, honest.

132
00:11:35,988 --> 00:11:38,449
I deserted.
I was stationed in Madrid.

133
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:40,534
Just look in my case!

134
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:54,256
The de Valera version!
Are you a Protestant?

135
00:11:55,091 --> 00:11:56,967
No, sir. Agnostic.

136
00:11:59,095 --> 00:12:01,055
Right, come on, son.

137
00:12:01,472 --> 00:12:03,265
You come home with me.

138
00:12:03,599 --> 00:12:05,643
- I'll get those off.
- Listen.

139
00:12:05,976 --> 00:12:08,688
Encarna will be waiting
for you.

140
00:12:09,814 --> 00:12:11,899
I'm sorry about the sergeant.

141
00:12:12,441 --> 00:12:14,944
This discipline business
is shit.

142
00:12:15,152 --> 00:12:16,278
If you accept it,...

143
00:12:16,529 --> 00:12:20,366
...discipline can make you
kill your mother if need be.

144
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:23,285
- The guard said that.
- Brave animal.

145
00:12:23,911 --> 00:12:27,206
But one thing,
he did sing very well.

146
00:12:27,623 --> 00:12:28,874
Flamenco, I mean...

147
00:12:29,542 --> 00:12:30,710
As for me,...

148
00:12:31,043 --> 00:12:34,880
...I've had three great
frustrations in my lifetime.

149
00:12:36,048 --> 00:12:38,676
- I see you've got the knack.
- So so.

150
00:12:39,427 --> 00:12:42,388
Three frustrations
which embittered my life.

151
00:12:42,638 --> 00:12:43,973
It looks good.

152
00:12:44,432 --> 00:12:46,892
In the seminary they called
it divine.

153
00:12:47,226 --> 00:12:48,769
Were you a cook there?

154
00:12:49,145 --> 00:12:53,149
If you're on a scholarship
you have to work as well.

155
00:12:53,482 --> 00:12:56,152
And as I was a good cook...

156
00:12:56,485 --> 00:12:58,612
What about your frustrations?

157
00:13:00,489 --> 00:13:03,617
The first was not being born
among heathens.

158
00:13:03,993 --> 00:13:07,747
Because with baptism
you're ruined forever.

159
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,123
Why?

160
00:13:09,373 --> 00:13:12,001
Don't you priests say
that baptism...

161
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:15,129
...leaves an indelible mark
on the soul?

162
00:13:15,379 --> 00:13:17,673
I only spent six years
in the seminary.

163
00:13:17,882 --> 00:13:21,552
Second, because of my feet,
I wasn't called up.

164
00:13:21,761 --> 00:13:24,346
So I couldn't desert.
Come on, drink up.

165
00:13:24,972 --> 00:13:28,851
You should get rid
of the uniform and the bugle.

166
00:13:29,185 --> 00:13:30,644
Burn them now.

167
00:13:31,187 --> 00:13:32,271
I can't.

168
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:33,981
They'll give you away.

169
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:38,194
They're not mine,
I have to return them.

170
00:13:40,404 --> 00:13:42,573
A very honorable decision.

171
00:13:42,907 --> 00:13:44,658
How will you return them?

172
00:13:45,117 --> 00:13:46,076
By mail?

173
00:13:46,535 --> 00:13:49,079
No. When we have a Republic.

174
00:13:49,413 --> 00:13:50,414
What about...

175
00:13:50,623 --> 00:13:51,665
...your third frustration?

176
00:13:53,209 --> 00:13:55,085
It's something awful.

177
00:13:56,003 --> 00:13:59,715
It so happens that I can
only get it up with my wife.

178
00:13:59,924 --> 00:14:01,467
So I can't cheat...

179
00:14:01,801 --> 00:14:02,885
...on our marriage.

180
00:14:03,219 --> 00:14:04,970
You see the paradox.

181
00:14:05,221 --> 00:14:08,891
As I couldn't rebel against
the church or the army,...

182
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:11,685
...or matrimony,
which, after banking,...

183
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:15,773
...are the most reactionary
institutions around,...

184
00:14:15,981 --> 00:14:18,901
...here I am,
a rebel, an infidel,...

185
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,320
...and a libertine
by nature,...

186
00:14:21,654 --> 00:14:24,406
...living like
a scared old bourgeois.

187
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:28,702
Hey!

188
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:33,123
This is the best damn cod
I’ve tasted in my life.

189
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:35,918
Come in, come in.

190
00:14:36,252 --> 00:14:39,296
It's better if you sleep here,
there's a stove.

191
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,299
- Wherever you say, sir.
- Enough of that.

192
00:14:42,675 --> 00:14:44,301
Don't be so formal!

193
00:14:45,344 --> 00:14:48,514
Throw a bit of wood
in the stove.

194
00:15:02,403 --> 00:15:03,362
My wife.

195
00:15:19,503 --> 00:15:21,255
Damn woman.

196
00:15:23,716 --> 00:15:26,427
What's this?
Are we sleeping together?

197
00:15:26,635 --> 00:15:29,847
If you want to sleep alone,
go to another room.

198
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:33,309
But believe me,
this house is an icebox.

199
00:15:33,517 --> 00:15:34,643
What's more,...

200
00:15:35,019 --> 00:15:36,979
...you can read me to sleep.

201
00:15:37,354 --> 00:15:38,188
You wouldn't be queer?

202
00:15:40,441 --> 00:15:41,901
No, nothing like that.

203
00:15:42,151 --> 00:15:44,486
I told you.
Except with my wife,...

204
00:15:45,029 --> 00:15:46,906
...I'm totally impotent.

205
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:48,991
It may be my age.

206
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:51,619
The insomnia, I mean.

207
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,380
Read me something
from the Bible.

208
00:16:13,641 --> 00:16:15,684
The Old or New Testament?

209
00:16:16,226 --> 00:16:19,146
I don't care.
It's just to fall sleep.

210
00:16:20,397 --> 00:16:23,651
Read the page it opens at,
like the English do.

211
00:16:30,282 --> 00:16:34,244
" Because the fate of the sons
of men and of beasts...

212
00:16:34,495 --> 00:16:36,330
...is the selfsame fate.

213
00:16:36,789 --> 00:16:39,416
The first die,
and the others too."

214
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:42,461
Hell, it's Ecclesiastes.
We're doing well.

215
00:16:45,297 --> 00:16:47,007
" And the others die too,...

216
00:16:47,216 --> 00:16:49,760
...and both have
the selfsame breath.

217
00:16:50,094 --> 00:16:54,014
Man has no advantage over
the beast, for all is vanity.

218
00:16:54,223 --> 00:16:56,058
Both go to the same place.

219
00:16:56,392 --> 00:16:59,728
Both come from the dust
and to dust both return.

220
00:17:00,813 --> 00:17:04,566
Who knows if the spirit
of man mounts upward,...

221
00:17:04,942 --> 00:17:07,861
...or that of the beast
goes into the earth?"

222
00:17:08,112 --> 00:17:09,697
Ah, there's the rub.

223
00:17:12,116 --> 00:17:15,953
" I see there is no happiness
for man...

224
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:19,790
...but to be happy in his work,
for that is his lot.

225
00:17:20,332 --> 00:17:24,586
ho then can bring him to see
what will happen after him?"

226
00:18:47,419 --> 00:18:49,838
- Morning, Don Manolo.
- Hello, Palomo.

227
00:18:50,047 --> 00:18:52,216
What's the damn mayor
doing here?

228
00:18:52,424 --> 00:18:55,677
He's waiting
for the carnival band.

229
00:18:57,012 --> 00:18:58,972
What a country, Fernando.

230
00:18:59,223 --> 00:19:01,850
Spain is on the verge
of a new era,...

231
00:19:02,101 --> 00:19:04,353
...and we've got carnivals.

232
00:19:13,028 --> 00:19:14,613
Morning, Don Manolo.

233
00:19:15,364 --> 00:19:16,406
Hello, Jesus.

234
00:19:17,866 --> 00:19:20,828
Really, Fernando,
I’m sorry you're leaving.

235
00:19:21,036 --> 00:19:23,122
I had to go some day.

236
00:19:23,539 --> 00:19:25,124
What I mean is,...

237
00:19:25,332 --> 00:19:28,127
...it's not just that
I’ve eaten well,...

238
00:19:28,335 --> 00:19:30,295
...and had someone
to chat with.

239
00:19:31,046 --> 00:19:34,007
I wouldn't have minded
if you'd stayed.

240
00:19:34,341 --> 00:19:37,511
But now, with my daughters,
it's different.

241
00:19:38,428 --> 00:19:41,390
- You understand my position.
- Of course.

242
00:19:42,057 --> 00:19:45,394
It's just that,
as I never had any sons...

243
00:19:45,769 --> 00:19:49,064
Well, I guess
I got fond of you.

244
00:19:49,898 --> 00:19:51,233
And I of you.

245
00:19:51,483 --> 00:19:54,194
Write as soon as you have
an address.

246
00:19:54,403 --> 00:19:55,654
Don't worry.

247
00:19:58,073 --> 00:19:59,241
There it is.

248
00:19:59,575 --> 00:20:02,369
- Mine or your daughters'?
- We'll see.

249
00:20:03,579 --> 00:20:04,246
Here.

250
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:07,541
- No, really, I don't need it.
- Come on, take it.

251
00:20:17,676 --> 00:20:19,261
It's the Madrid train.

252
00:20:29,229 --> 00:20:30,105
There they are!

253
00:20:30,522 --> 00:20:32,399
Well, as they say,...

254
00:20:32,733 --> 00:20:34,484
...Health and the Republic.

255
00:20:34,735 --> 00:20:36,403
The best of luck to you!

256
00:20:42,534 --> 00:20:43,577
Dad!

257
00:20:44,036 --> 00:20:44,870
Clara!

258
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:50,083
- Violeta!
- Dad! How are you?

259
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,379
Dad!

260
00:20:55,214 --> 00:20:57,299
How handsome you look!

261
00:20:57,716 --> 00:21:00,385
You're the ones
who look beautiful.

262
00:21:01,428 --> 00:21:02,304
Dad!

263
00:21:02,512 --> 00:21:04,598
Luz! Give me a kiss.

264
00:21:10,854 --> 00:21:12,731
Just look at him,
a real mess.

265
00:21:12,981 --> 00:21:14,441
Don't start nagging.

266
00:21:14,691 --> 00:21:15,901
I smell anisette.

267
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:17,986
She's just like your mother.

268
00:21:18,195 --> 00:21:20,489
Get your cases
and we'll go home.

269
00:21:20,697 --> 00:21:22,532
- Who's this?
- He's a friend.

270
00:21:22,783 --> 00:21:25,118
But he's off to Madrid.
' Bye, Fernando.

271
00:21:25,369 --> 00:21:27,412
Come, the buggy's outside.

272
00:21:27,788 --> 00:21:30,999
Why did you decide
to come all of a sudden?

273
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:32,834
Haven't you heard the news?

274
00:21:33,168 --> 00:21:36,421
Madrid is awful.
Strikes, fighting, shooting.

275
00:21:36,672 --> 00:21:39,925
Well, the paper gets here
three days late.

276
00:21:55,524 --> 00:21:56,191
Here...

277
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:58,527
- Anything else?
- No, that's all.

278
00:21:58,735 --> 00:22:01,989
Just as well. So much shit...

279
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:15,752
- You fixed it?
- Yeah, it was blocked.

280
00:22:15,961 --> 00:22:18,588
You can wear Mother's
dress.

281
00:22:18,797 --> 00:22:22,426
Are you fed up cleaning?
Come on, lend me a hand.

282
00:22:22,634 --> 00:22:24,761
- Anyway I’m not going.
- Why not?

283
00:22:25,012 --> 00:22:27,180
I don't dance to minstrels.

284
00:22:27,431 --> 00:22:29,349
And the men here are brutes.

285
00:22:29,558 --> 00:22:33,353
They love to pull a plough
into the dance and ruin it.

286
00:22:33,603 --> 00:22:35,314
Dad told us, remember?

287
00:22:36,148 --> 00:22:38,900
- Talk of the devil.
- Open the door, Luz.

288
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:41,528
It's always me!

289
00:22:50,162 --> 00:22:51,997
The boy from the station!

290
00:22:53,665 --> 00:22:54,333
Yes.

291
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:56,209
I missed the train.

292
00:22:56,543 --> 00:22:59,212
- Is Manolo in?
- No, but he won't be long.

293
00:22:59,463 --> 00:23:00,213
Go up that way.

294
00:23:37,292 --> 00:23:38,377
Luz, who was it?

295
00:23:40,587 --> 00:23:42,464
Clara, this boy has come...

296
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:43,757
...to see Dad.

297
00:23:46,009 --> 00:23:47,052
Good afternoon.

298
00:23:47,302 --> 00:23:48,762
Am I bothering you?

299
00:23:49,096 --> 00:23:50,639
No, not at all.
Come in.

300
00:23:55,394 --> 00:23:57,813
Carnival starts tomorrow...

301
00:23:59,856 --> 00:24:03,193
He was at the station,
he missed the train.

302
00:24:03,527 --> 00:24:05,195
I went to the village,...

303
00:24:05,445 --> 00:24:07,739
...but there's no inn there.

304
00:24:07,948 --> 00:24:11,618
And, as I’d stayed here
with Manolo, I thought,...

305
00:24:12,744 --> 00:24:13,995
...maybe...

306
00:24:16,957 --> 00:24:20,210
No, I was stationed
at the Madrid aerodrome.

307
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:23,588
Galin and Garcia Hernandez
were shot the 14th,...

308
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:27,968
...but the uprising went on
and the radio announced,...

309
00:24:28,176 --> 00:24:31,805
..."The Republic proclaimed
in Madrid. Play reveille."

310
00:24:32,055 --> 00:24:34,182
And as I was bugler,
I played it.

311
00:24:34,724 --> 00:24:37,310
- Play it now!
- Ignore her. Go on.

312
00:24:37,561 --> 00:24:41,940
The planes flew over Madrid,
but nothing was happening.

313
00:24:42,149 --> 00:24:45,861
And Ramon Franco
wouldn't bomb the Palace,...

314
00:24:46,069 --> 00:24:48,530
...because he saw children...

315
00:24:48,864 --> 00:24:50,198
...playing near there.

316
00:24:50,407 --> 00:24:51,825
When did you escape?

317
00:24:53,368 --> 00:24:56,037
As the Government troops
were arriving.

318
00:24:56,288 --> 00:24:59,958
I saw our leaders
taking planes to Portugal,...

319
00:25:00,167 --> 00:25:02,961
...so I changed clothes,
got my case and ran for it.

320
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:04,337
Where did you go?

321
00:25:04,796 --> 00:25:06,047
To the mountains.

322
00:25:06,381 --> 00:25:08,133
I was there over a month.

323
00:25:08,675 --> 00:25:09,759
What did you eat?

324
00:25:10,385 --> 00:25:11,845
Whatever I found.

325
00:25:12,095 --> 00:25:14,556
Especially cabbage.
A lot of cabbage.

326
00:25:14,764 --> 00:25:17,434
From the gardens.
What about sleeping?

327
00:25:17,767 --> 00:25:20,353
Where I could.
Often in churches.

328
00:25:20,562 --> 00:25:24,399
I’d hide until they locked up,
then lie on a bench,...

329
00:25:24,608 --> 00:25:26,276
...and keep warm with candles.

330
00:25:26,526 --> 00:25:27,486
Where were you going?

331
00:25:27,819 --> 00:25:28,403
La Coruba.

332
00:25:28,737 --> 00:25:29,279
La Coruba?

333
00:25:29,905 --> 00:25:31,490
To stow away to America.

334
00:25:31,823 --> 00:25:35,452
- A good thing you met Dad.
- Come on, play something.

335
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:38,079
Do you think a bugle
is like a saxophone?

336
00:25:38,413 --> 00:25:39,664
Anyway, he's eating.

337
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,500
No, I don't mind.

338
00:25:47,005 --> 00:25:49,674
The usual reveille
or the fancy one?

339
00:25:50,133 --> 00:25:52,469
So then I said to Unamuno,...

340
00:25:52,719 --> 00:25:55,597
..."No, Don Miguel,
you're mistaken".

341
00:25:55,805 --> 00:25:58,475
And you know what he's like,
don't you?

342
00:25:58,808 --> 00:26:00,977
Imagine how he reacted.

343
00:26:01,228 --> 00:26:05,106
I can just imagine.
When did he last write to you?

344
00:26:06,983 --> 00:26:07,943
What's that?

345
00:26:08,568 --> 00:26:11,530
That, my dear Luis,
is the fucking seminarian.

346
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:15,825
He hung around when he got
a whiff of my girls' pussies.

347
00:26:16,034 --> 00:26:17,410
Good God, man!

348
00:26:25,961 --> 00:26:27,712
- Beautiful!
- And so lively!

349
00:26:28,046 --> 00:26:30,632
- It was lovely!
- And what lungs!

350
00:26:33,552 --> 00:26:36,304
- Good evening!
- Hello, Dad. Look who's here.

351
00:26:38,348 --> 00:26:41,142
You missed the train.
Am I right?

352
00:26:42,852 --> 00:26:45,981
- How are you, Don Luis?
- Not as well as you girls.

353
00:26:46,398 --> 00:26:49,067
You get prettier every day.

354
00:26:50,026 --> 00:26:51,570
What smells so good?

355
00:26:51,903 --> 00:26:54,447
Fernando is a wonderful cook.

356
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:56,783
I knew that already.

357
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:02,581
Health and the Republic, son.
Thank God you didn't leave.

358
00:27:03,707 --> 00:27:04,666
What is it?

359
00:27:05,292 --> 00:27:06,668
Chicken casserole.

360
00:27:08,211 --> 00:27:10,046
I went to the village,...

361
00:27:10,422 --> 00:27:12,173
...but there's no inn.

362
00:27:12,924 --> 00:27:15,844
You could have gone
to Polonia's place.

363
00:27:16,052 --> 00:27:18,680
How could he go to that dump?

364
00:27:19,723 --> 00:27:20,682
I forgot about that.

365
00:27:21,308 --> 00:27:25,562
Encarna's there. She's probably
still waiting for you.

366
00:27:36,156 --> 00:27:37,198
Here, Mother.

367
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:41,995
Are you all ready?

368
00:27:44,748 --> 00:27:46,207
One, two...

369
00:27:47,042 --> 00:27:49,794
Looks like we're in for
a musical night.

370
00:27:55,967 --> 00:27:57,093
It's the teacher!

371
00:27:57,969 --> 00:28:02,515
These are the melodies
which King David would sing...

372
00:28:04,351 --> 00:28:07,854
...to the pretty girls,
and now we sing them to you.

373
00:28:08,104 --> 00:28:10,857
Awaken, my love, awaken,...

374
00:28:11,107 --> 00:28:13,401
...look, the dawn is here.

375
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:17,238
The little birds are singing,
and the moon has hid her face.

376
00:28:30,293 --> 00:28:31,836
Son, they're going inside.

377
00:28:32,671 --> 00:28:33,463
Clara!

378
00:28:33,797 --> 00:28:36,341
Can we come in?
I’m with my mother.

379
00:28:37,008 --> 00:28:40,637
I swear, that boy gets crazier
every day.

380
00:28:40,887 --> 00:28:42,847
That often happens to teachers.

381
00:28:43,181 --> 00:28:46,017
It's working with children
that does it.

382
00:28:46,226 --> 00:28:48,436
Come in.
How are you, Doña Asun?

383
00:28:48,812 --> 00:28:50,647
Awful, my dear. Just awful.

384
00:28:50,939 --> 00:28:54,901
Now the guards are committing
suicide. Two at a time!

385
00:28:55,151 --> 00:28:57,696
These are bad times
for decent people.

386
00:28:58,029 --> 00:29:00,073
Weren't you in mourning?

387
00:29:00,323 --> 00:29:03,451
Mourning is carried
in the heart, Doña Asun.

388
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:07,288
I don't speak to you.
Long live Christ the King!

389
00:29:07,539 --> 00:29:08,873
So say I. So say I.

390
00:29:09,332 --> 00:29:13,586
How can you receive a priest
like him in this house?

391
00:29:15,547 --> 00:29:16,589
Who's this?

392
00:29:17,132 --> 00:29:17,799
A cousin.

393
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:20,093
He's handsome.

394
00:29:20,844 --> 00:29:23,096
- Where were we?
- The bracelet, Mother.

395
00:29:23,722 --> 00:29:26,307
You've got it out?
Give it to her, then.

396
00:29:26,516 --> 00:29:29,394
Not like that!
You must speak first.

397
00:29:30,353 --> 00:29:33,732
Well, I must say
I would have preferred...

398
00:29:34,065 --> 00:29:36,651
...a Carlist family,
but still,...

399
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:39,320
...Republicans are better
than Bourbons.

400
00:29:39,571 --> 00:29:41,948
Get to the point, Mother.

401
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:44,534
As Juanito is an only child,...

402
00:29:44,784 --> 00:29:47,245
...l tend to spoil him,
so here we are.

403
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:48,830
Luz!

404
00:29:51,166 --> 00:29:52,250
I know, the door!

405
00:29:53,877 --> 00:29:55,628
May I have another drink?

406
00:29:56,755 --> 00:29:58,715
When he heard
the girls were here,...

407
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:03,136
...he washed his feet
and said to me, " Mother,...

408
00:30:03,386 --> 00:30:07,307
...as the band is here,
we'll serenade Manolo's house.

409
00:30:07,515 --> 00:30:09,142
Then we'll ask for her hand.

410
00:30:10,977 --> 00:30:12,145
Whose hand?

411
00:30:12,479 --> 00:30:13,521
My girl friend's.

412
00:30:13,855 --> 00:30:15,273
You never said anything.

413
00:30:15,607 --> 00:30:17,150
What was there to say?

414
00:30:17,358 --> 00:30:20,487
My grandmother got engaged
with that bracelet,...

415
00:30:20,737 --> 00:30:22,363
...and my mother and I.

416
00:30:22,697 --> 00:30:25,366
Did you tell her
I’ll be living with you?

417
00:30:25,617 --> 00:30:27,577
Later, Mother.
Do you like it?

418
00:30:28,203 --> 00:30:29,788
Yes, it's really beautiful.

419
00:30:30,121 --> 00:30:31,372
You really want...

420
00:30:31,706 --> 00:30:32,791
...to marry him?

421
00:30:33,124 --> 00:30:34,584
I don't know.

422
00:30:35,001 --> 00:30:37,921
When did we ever talk
about getting married?

423
00:30:38,129 --> 00:30:41,758
- I wrote it to you in a poem!
- You don't love him?

424
00:30:42,509 --> 00:30:43,760
Thank you, my dear.

425
00:30:44,219 --> 00:30:47,472
Come on. Who's better
for you than your mother?

426
00:30:47,722 --> 00:30:48,765
No, Mother. Wait!

427
00:30:49,015 --> 00:30:52,393
It's not my fault, it's lust.
He's blinded by lust.

428
00:30:52,727 --> 00:30:54,145
They burned the church!

429
00:30:54,354 --> 00:30:58,233
The sexton's gone crazy!
He's burned the church!

430
00:30:58,566 --> 00:31:00,819
Damn him to...
Where's my beret?

431
00:31:01,152 --> 00:31:02,821
What came over him?

432
00:31:03,154 --> 00:31:05,865
I bet this heretic priest
put him up to it!

433
00:31:06,074 --> 00:31:07,534
For Christ's sake!

434
00:31:07,742 --> 00:31:09,786
I wouldn't give him a raise,...

435
00:31:09,994 --> 00:31:12,997
...and so he's decided
to become an anarchist.

436
00:31:13,748 --> 00:31:15,625
- Let's go, Juanito.
- Where?

437
00:31:15,875 --> 00:31:17,585
To the church, in atonement.

438
00:31:17,794 --> 00:31:19,629
Rocio, tell her we're engaged!

439
00:31:19,963 --> 00:31:24,133
Tell her how we fell in love
last summer fishing crabs!

440
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:35,019
- Careful, there's a loose step.
- I see it.

441
00:31:39,691 --> 00:31:41,776
You'll be real comfortable.

442
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:54,038
They're made of maize leaves.
They're so soft.

443
00:31:59,794 --> 00:32:01,170
Give me the sheets.

444
00:32:20,857 --> 00:32:22,400
Did you see that fool?

445
00:32:23,526 --> 00:32:25,320
There's nothing between you?

446
00:32:25,653 --> 00:32:27,280
We're just good friends.

447
00:32:27,822 --> 00:32:31,618
ell, last summer we fooled
around a bit, that's all.

448
00:32:35,121 --> 00:32:37,582
The summer's
real good fun here.

449
00:32:37,957 --> 00:32:41,920
I mean, if you'd come in summer
it would have been different.

450
00:32:42,128 --> 00:32:42,795
Why?

451
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:46,007
We come here every year.

452
00:32:46,341 --> 00:32:47,091
What do you do?

453
00:32:47,842 --> 00:32:49,093
Lots of things.

454
00:32:49,344 --> 00:32:52,347
We go on excursions,
have picnics,...

455
00:32:52,555 --> 00:32:54,307
...swim in the river.

456
00:32:54,641 --> 00:32:56,017
And fish crabs.

457
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,395
Don't be dirty-minded.

458
00:32:59,646 --> 00:33:01,230
Juanito's nothing to me.

459
00:33:01,564 --> 00:33:06,027
But, because he's so rich,
he thinks we're all after him.

460
00:33:09,072 --> 00:33:10,031
Pass me the heater.

461
00:33:19,082 --> 00:33:21,459
You're going to be so warm.

462
00:33:24,379 --> 00:33:26,255
What do you want
for breakfast?

463
00:33:26,464 --> 00:33:29,634
- I’ll make breakfast.
- Oh, that's right.

464
00:33:29,884 --> 00:33:33,388
We're useless at cooking.
Dad must have told you.

465
00:33:33,596 --> 00:33:34,138
Yes.

466
00:33:36,766 --> 00:33:38,059
What will you do?

467
00:33:39,268 --> 00:33:39,936
Me?

468
00:33:40,478 --> 00:33:42,146
For breakfast, I mean.

469
00:33:43,439 --> 00:33:45,775
Do you like fried bread?

470
00:33:47,735 --> 00:33:49,195
More than anything.

471
00:33:49,737 --> 00:33:52,573
If I come in summer,
can we go to the river?

472
00:33:55,243 --> 00:33:56,869
To fish crabs?

473
00:33:58,913 --> 00:34:00,164
If you want.

474
00:34:03,209 --> 00:34:05,128
What are you doing?

475
00:34:05,336 --> 00:34:07,296
See you in the morning.

476
00:34:08,214 --> 00:34:11,384
I nearly forgot.
Just in case you need it.

477
00:34:13,928 --> 00:34:15,096
The heater!

478
00:34:20,643 --> 00:34:23,062
No, really, I mean it...

479
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:30,028
Rocio! What was that?

480
00:34:31,446 --> 00:34:33,322
Nothing. I’m coming, Dad!

481
00:34:39,162 --> 00:34:39,620
Go on.

482
00:34:39,954 --> 00:34:42,123
I said we come here
in summer,...

483
00:34:42,457 --> 00:34:46,210
...and have a great time,
and he wants to come next year.

484
00:34:46,461 --> 00:34:47,837
To fish crabs.

485
00:34:48,046 --> 00:34:50,715
Can't he just come
and swim in the river?

486
00:34:51,966 --> 00:34:53,509
The poor boy.

487
00:34:55,887 --> 00:34:56,929
Who? Fernando?

488
00:34:57,972 --> 00:34:59,223
No. Higinio.

489
00:35:00,475 --> 00:35:02,518
Why bring your husband up?

490
00:35:02,769 --> 00:35:05,063
Higinio drowned in the river.

491
00:35:06,064 --> 00:35:07,065
That's right.

492
00:35:07,899 --> 00:35:11,360
- Every time I remember...
- Well, don't remember!

493
00:35:13,112 --> 00:35:16,574
And he cooked paella
so well that day! Remember?

494
00:35:17,408 --> 00:35:21,162
- He was good with rice.
- That's all he was good at.

495
00:35:21,412 --> 00:35:22,747
That's true.

496
00:35:24,791 --> 00:35:28,377
If he'd given me a baby
instead of all that paella!

497
00:35:31,214 --> 00:35:32,757
- Continue.
- All right.

498
00:35:33,007 --> 00:35:35,384
I was putting the heater
in the bed,...

499
00:35:35,593 --> 00:35:37,887
...and suddenly he kissed me.

500
00:35:38,513 --> 00:35:42,058
- Was he naked at the time?
- Did you hear that child?

501
00:35:42,391 --> 00:35:46,187
Do you think because
I’m an idiot?

502
00:35:46,395 --> 00:35:47,563
Luz, really.

503
00:35:47,814 --> 00:35:50,191
So he kissed you
and you ran for it.

504
00:35:50,566 --> 00:35:53,027
You idiot.
Fernando's gorgeous!

505
00:35:53,236 --> 00:35:55,113
Well, forget about him.

506
00:35:55,363 --> 00:35:58,491
We don't want problems
with that seminarian.

507
00:36:03,538 --> 00:36:06,415
" And the signatories
are at your service,...

508
00:36:06,666 --> 00:36:10,503
...ready to unite
within one Party,...

509
00:36:10,837 --> 00:36:15,383
...and propose to form
a broad coalition,...

510
00:36:15,591 --> 00:36:17,385
...to serve the Republic."

511
00:36:17,593 --> 00:36:19,178
Who are the signatories?

512
00:36:19,387 --> 00:36:21,931
The first ones are
Ortega y Gasset,...

513
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:24,225
...Gregorio Marañón
and Perez de Ayala.

514
00:36:24,433 --> 00:36:25,393
Nobodies!

515
00:36:25,768 --> 00:36:27,228
What about Don Miguel?

516
00:36:28,062 --> 00:36:30,565
I don't see his name,
but no matter.

517
00:36:30,773 --> 00:36:33,734
The King has accepted
Berenguer's resignation,...

518
00:36:33,985 --> 00:36:35,570
...and met with Romanones.

519
00:36:35,778 --> 00:36:37,238
Dad, we're back!

520
00:36:37,905 --> 00:36:39,991
- Come on, Fernando.
- So long, Don Luis.

521
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:44,662
Let's see what that meddler
Romanones will do now.

522
00:36:44,912 --> 00:36:47,039
If Unamuno hasn't signed...

523
00:36:50,585 --> 00:36:51,669
Hello, Fernando.

524
00:36:52,879 --> 00:36:56,007
He's a real bore
about that damn Don Miguel.

525
00:36:56,215 --> 00:36:59,844
He can't see that Unamuno
is a poet, not a thinker.

526
00:37:00,178 --> 00:37:04,432
Forgive your people, Lord.

527
00:37:04,974 --> 00:37:08,060
Forgive your people.

528
00:37:08,394 --> 00:37:10,563
Forgive them, Lord.

529
00:37:10,771 --> 00:37:12,648
- Dad...
- Yes, dear.

530
00:37:12,857 --> 00:37:16,277
- Can't I go to the dance?
- Who said you couldn't?

531
00:37:16,527 --> 00:37:17,486
You see?

532
00:37:18,154 --> 00:37:22,241
Do not be eternally annoyed.

533
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:23,576
Forgive them, Lord!

534
00:37:32,251 --> 00:37:33,502
It's too big for me.

535
00:37:36,047 --> 00:37:39,008
- What are you doing?
- Choosing our costumes.

536
00:37:39,217 --> 00:37:40,593
What will you wear?

537
00:37:40,843 --> 00:37:43,095
Me? Nothing. I’m not going.

538
00:37:43,346 --> 00:37:46,974
Why not? Go and enjoy yourself.
You still can.

539
00:37:47,225 --> 00:37:48,309
I don't know.

540
00:37:48,517 --> 00:37:50,353
But I won't get dressed up.

541
00:37:50,561 --> 00:37:52,772
I think this would suit you.

542
00:37:55,483 --> 00:37:57,818
- His suspenders.
- What are you doing?

543
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:08,829
Leave me alone!

544
00:38:20,466 --> 00:38:23,594
I’m not going like this,
I’m embarrassed.

545
00:38:23,761 --> 00:38:26,222
- You look great.
- Don't be silly.

546
00:38:26,472 --> 00:38:29,225
No, you go on ahead.
I’ll go in later.

547
00:38:33,771 --> 00:38:35,564
You're a real disaster.

548
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:38,985
Let me...

549
00:39:00,631 --> 00:39:01,757
Do this.

550
00:39:11,934 --> 00:39:13,769
You're so pretty!

551
00:40:18,501 --> 00:40:19,668
Make way there.

552
00:40:33,099 --> 00:40:34,767
Make way for the baby.

553
00:40:54,829 --> 00:40:55,579
Rocio...

554
00:40:56,622 --> 00:40:58,874
You look nice.
What's your disguise?

555
00:40:59,083 --> 00:41:02,211
It's not a disguise.
It's my Grandad's uniform.

556
00:41:02,545 --> 00:41:04,713
- It suits you.
- That's why I put it on.

557
00:41:05,047 --> 00:41:07,383
- I don't want to dance.
- Neither do I.

558
00:41:07,633 --> 00:41:09,510
Your letters and photos.

559
00:41:10,052 --> 00:41:12,179
What's all this about?

560
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:14,890
You hear that?
What about last night?

561
00:41:15,224 --> 00:41:18,144
It's not my fault
your mother's a reactionary.

562
00:41:18,352 --> 00:41:19,687
Leave her out of it!

563
00:41:20,354 --> 00:41:21,105
Look.

564
00:41:22,273 --> 00:41:23,023
Here.

565
00:41:23,274 --> 00:41:26,861
" Dear Juanito, I got your poem
and was so surprised."

566
00:41:27,069 --> 00:41:30,030
Signed by you. Didn't you know
I wanted to marry?

567
00:41:30,281 --> 00:41:33,409
What you think it's
like buying meat?

568
00:41:33,617 --> 00:41:35,161
Am I right or not?

569
00:41:35,494 --> 00:41:38,998
- Then give me back the bracelet.
- No, I won't.

570
00:41:39,165 --> 00:41:40,124
What do you mean?

571
00:41:41,792 --> 00:41:44,462
Come here, you twit.
You're a twit.

572
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:46,755
Are we engaged or not?

573
00:41:46,964 --> 00:41:49,049
- I am, you're not!
- I am, silly.

574
00:41:49,467 --> 00:41:52,261
But these things take time,
don't you see?

575
00:41:52,595 --> 00:41:55,431
Get us something to drink,
and then we'll talk.

576
00:41:56,182 --> 00:41:59,351
- Drinks?
- Yes, real cold ones.

577
00:42:06,233 --> 00:42:08,277
- It's a shame really.
- What is?

578
00:42:08,736 --> 00:42:10,488
The way you treat him.

579
00:42:10,738 --> 00:42:13,449
What can I do?
He's a jerk.

580
00:42:13,657 --> 00:42:15,201
That's true too.

581
00:42:19,413 --> 00:42:22,291
Look, with Romanones in power,
I’m happy.

582
00:42:22,625 --> 00:42:25,294
All this Republic business
will peter out.

583
00:42:25,711 --> 00:42:26,378
Sure.

584
00:42:27,421 --> 00:42:31,800
You can carry on as mayor,
lending money at 50% interest.

585
00:42:32,009 --> 00:42:35,888
Better an honest man like me
than one like the sexton.

586
00:42:37,014 --> 00:42:39,350
What's wrong with
the new government?

587
00:42:39,558 --> 00:42:40,768
Wrong with it? Nothing.

588
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:43,479
What a cabinet!

589
00:42:43,938 --> 00:42:46,732
Minister of State,
Romanones.

590
00:43:06,085 --> 00:43:08,712
Adviser to the Spanish
Bank of Credit...

591
00:43:19,181 --> 00:43:22,142
Would you rather
a gang of revolutionaries?

592
00:43:23,352 --> 00:43:25,646
Is Alcala Zamora
a revolutionary?

593
00:43:25,854 --> 00:43:28,983
He goes to mass daily.
Go to hell, man.

594
00:44:10,566 --> 00:44:14,528
- Aren't you envious?
- Of whom?

595
00:44:14,862 --> 00:44:16,322
Of those two.

596
00:44:17,448 --> 00:44:20,200
Yes, I am envious.

597
00:45:00,574 --> 00:45:01,659
The drinks.

598
00:45:02,493 --> 00:45:03,744
And I forgive you.

599
00:45:06,205 --> 00:45:08,165
- Let's dance.
- No, no.

600
00:45:08,374 --> 00:45:10,125
Didn't you forgive me?

601
00:45:10,334 --> 00:45:12,169
Yes, but the tango is banned.

602
00:45:12,378 --> 00:45:15,297
- You don't say!
- Pius X banned it.

603
00:45:15,506 --> 00:45:18,634
- What would he know?
- The Pope knows everything.

604
00:45:18,884 --> 00:45:20,344
He's infallible.

605
00:45:21,804 --> 00:45:23,138
It's shameful.

606
00:45:44,952 --> 00:45:47,579
- What's wrong?
- I’m not dancing anymore.

607
00:46:12,229 --> 00:46:15,649
- Hey, pigeon, are you alone?
- Leave me be!

608
00:46:17,276 --> 00:46:20,320
Look, sweetheart,
don't play innocent.

609
00:46:33,792 --> 00:46:36,044
Wait, my shoe's come off.

610
00:46:42,468 --> 00:46:45,220
Fuck, you acted
just like a man.

611
00:46:45,596 --> 00:46:47,014
That's what I am.

612
00:47:29,431 --> 00:47:30,766
Damn.

613
00:47:32,226 --> 00:47:33,393
Easy...

614
00:47:48,867 --> 00:47:50,035
Come on.

615
00:47:51,578 --> 00:47:52,621
Climb up.

616
00:47:53,747 --> 00:47:55,499
- Here?
- Go on!

617
00:48:23,694 --> 00:48:24,653
Now what?

618
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:26,572
What do you think?

619
00:49:44,274 --> 00:49:46,735
Put your tongue like this.

620
00:49:48,904 --> 00:49:50,030
Now blow.

621
00:49:52,199 --> 00:49:53,659
Blow, for fuck's sake!

622
00:49:55,702 --> 00:49:59,039
Do you know he wouldn't
dance a tango last night?

623
00:49:59,790 --> 00:50:01,458
It's his mother's influence.

624
00:50:01,792 --> 00:50:03,752
But do you love him or not?

625
00:50:04,294 --> 00:50:07,422
I guess I do,
because the idiot's lovable.

626
00:50:07,798 --> 00:50:09,257
But I don't like him.

627
00:50:09,675 --> 00:50:12,260
And to marry a man,
you have to like him.

628
00:50:12,594 --> 00:50:15,681
Do you think I liked
Higinio at first,...

629
00:50:15,889 --> 00:50:18,058
...with all that hair
in his nose?

630
00:50:18,392 --> 00:50:19,059
So?

631
00:50:19,267 --> 00:50:21,311
I got used to him.

632
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:23,647
Now I miss him more
every day.

633
00:50:23,939 --> 00:50:26,900
That's because you don't
see the hair.

634
00:50:27,234 --> 00:50:30,654
Don't kid yourself.
A woman has to have a man.

635
00:50:30,862 --> 00:50:32,072
Especially at night.

636
00:50:32,614 --> 00:50:34,199
You're right.

637
00:50:36,410 --> 00:50:37,369
Even Violeta.

638
00:50:37,744 --> 00:50:39,204
What does that mean?

639
00:50:40,038 --> 00:50:42,165
Swear you won't tell anyone.

640
00:50:42,708 --> 00:50:44,668
I swear. Tell what?

641
00:50:51,925 --> 00:50:52,968
Violeta?

642
00:51:02,811 --> 00:51:03,895
Hello, Fernando.

643
00:51:04,229 --> 00:51:06,398
Hello. Have you seen Violeta?

644
00:51:07,274 --> 00:51:08,942
- Look.
- What is it?

645
00:51:09,151 --> 00:51:10,235
A sheet.

646
00:51:12,070 --> 00:51:14,197
Can you guess what it's for?

647
00:51:14,406 --> 00:51:15,407
No idea.

648
00:51:15,907 --> 00:51:18,285
- Come on and you'll see.
- Where?

649
00:51:18,535 --> 00:51:20,996
- The studio, you'll like it.
- What studio?

650
00:51:21,371 --> 00:51:24,332
Dad's. Didn't he tell you
he was a painter?

651
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:29,838
I haven't been in here
for years.

652
00:51:30,047 --> 00:51:34,342
I left it the day I realized
painting was finished.

653
00:51:34,551 --> 00:51:38,805
Why go on painting if it's
all been done, I said.

654
00:51:39,056 --> 00:51:42,225
And I decided
to respect the canvas.

655
00:51:43,060 --> 00:51:44,144
My last work.

656
00:51:46,271 --> 00:51:48,231
Mother says that Dad is lazy.

657
00:51:48,565 --> 00:51:51,777
She may be right,
but you know how she is.

658
00:51:51,985 --> 00:51:53,820
A Russian copied it.

659
00:51:54,029 --> 00:51:55,155
He's called Malevich.

660
00:51:55,489 --> 00:51:57,074
But, look.
Look at the date.

661
00:51:57,407 --> 00:51:59,451
Mine is a year earlier.

662
00:52:01,495 --> 00:52:02,954
Manolo...

663
00:52:03,205 --> 00:52:04,664
I’ve something to say.

664
00:52:04,998 --> 00:52:05,665
Go on.

665
00:52:08,001 --> 00:52:09,086
Well, I’ve...

666
00:52:11,505 --> 00:52:13,965
- I’ve fallen in love.
- I knew it!

667
00:52:14,716 --> 00:52:16,760
That's why I told you
to go...

668
00:52:17,010 --> 00:52:18,470
...when they came.

669
00:52:19,596 --> 00:52:23,558
So now I gain a son-in-law
and lose a friend.

670
00:52:23,809 --> 00:52:24,851
Don't say that.

671
00:52:25,310 --> 00:52:26,978
Don't kid yourself.

672
00:52:28,021 --> 00:52:30,273
So, who's the lucky girl?

673
00:52:30,565 --> 00:52:31,817
Rocio, I guess.

674
00:52:34,444 --> 00:52:35,529
Violeta.

675
00:52:48,959 --> 00:52:51,378
If you go to town,
buy me matches.

676
00:52:51,586 --> 00:52:55,006
Buy them yourself,
you hussy!

677
00:53:01,263 --> 00:53:01,888
What...?

678
00:53:02,347 --> 00:53:03,723
What do you think?

679
00:53:04,266 --> 00:53:06,393
She'd got her hopes up.

680
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:10,605
- No, I haven't eaten.
- Drink up, you'll need it!

681
00:53:11,398 --> 00:53:14,151
This is like something
from a novel.

682
00:53:14,776 --> 00:53:17,654
What I mean is,
your love is impossible!

683
00:53:19,072 --> 00:53:19,948
Why?

684
00:53:21,491 --> 00:53:23,034
Because Violeta...

685
00:53:23,785 --> 00:53:24,536
Look...

686
00:53:25,787 --> 00:53:27,247
Have you told her?

687
00:53:28,707 --> 00:53:29,749
Told her?

688
00:53:31,209 --> 00:53:32,836
Why should I tell her...

689
00:53:33,795 --> 00:53:36,131
...after what happened
last night?

690
00:53:36,882 --> 00:53:38,049
Don't tell me...

691
00:53:39,509 --> 00:53:41,845
...there was copulation!

692
00:53:43,597 --> 00:53:45,140
A miracle!

693
00:53:46,183 --> 00:53:47,851
It's a miracle!

694
00:53:51,313 --> 00:53:52,480
Violeta!

695
00:53:56,818 --> 00:53:59,112
Violeta! My dear!
Give me a kiss!

696
00:53:59,446 --> 00:54:01,198
- A kiss!
- What's all this?

697
00:54:01,448 --> 00:54:02,490
A kiss, my dear.

698
00:54:03,116 --> 00:54:05,202
My first grandchild
must be a boy.

699
00:54:05,493 --> 00:54:06,536
I’m fed up...

700
00:54:07,037 --> 00:54:09,206
...with so many women
in the family.

701
00:54:09,414 --> 00:54:10,874
Are you crazy?

702
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:12,876
Why?

703
00:54:13,335 --> 00:54:15,253
I couldn't lie to him.

704
00:54:15,462 --> 00:54:17,672
Last night meant nothing!
Got it?

705
00:54:17,923 --> 00:54:20,300
Nothing! Get out of my sight!

706
00:54:21,218 --> 00:54:23,595
What's wrong?
I want to get married!

707
00:54:23,929 --> 00:54:27,307
Listen, son,
how can you marry a man?

708
00:54:30,727 --> 00:54:31,895
What's wrong?

709
00:54:39,361 --> 00:54:41,029
The bitch.

710
00:54:56,086 --> 00:54:57,545
What an idiot!

711
00:55:12,185 --> 00:55:13,812
Don't be hard on her.

712
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:15,814
It's all Mother's fault.

713
00:55:16,022 --> 00:55:18,525
She wanted Violeta
to be a boy.

714
00:55:18,733 --> 00:55:21,278
She'd bought everything
in blue.

715
00:55:21,736 --> 00:55:23,655
She already had a daughter.

716
00:55:23,863 --> 00:55:26,992
So she kept on
dressing her as a boy.

717
00:55:27,534 --> 00:55:30,996
But didn't your father
say anything about it?

718
00:55:31,329 --> 00:55:34,291
He was too involved
with his painting.

719
00:55:34,499 --> 00:55:38,878
But I think Violeta's been
influenced a lot by confession.

720
00:55:39,129 --> 00:55:41,172
- Aren't you atheists?
- Well, yes.

721
00:55:41,423 --> 00:55:43,591
But we made
our First Communion.

722
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:46,761
Because Mother loved
for us to look pretty.

723
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:51,766
Well, Violeta looked handsome,
because she wore a sailor-suit.

724
00:55:52,517 --> 00:55:54,144
What about confession?

725
00:55:54,352 --> 00:55:57,564
As Violeta confessed
on the boys' side,...

726
00:55:57,772 --> 00:56:01,401
...the priest talked to her
about lewd behavior. Imagine!

727
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:03,611
I sure can!

728
00:56:05,739 --> 00:56:07,115
Juanito and his mother.

729
00:56:10,952 --> 00:56:12,037
What is it?

730
00:56:12,245 --> 00:56:15,457
He wants me to try
his mother's wedding dress.

731
00:56:15,665 --> 00:56:17,083
It may need altering.

732
00:56:17,292 --> 00:56:20,003
Don't you dare.
And don't get it dirty!

733
00:56:23,048 --> 00:56:24,799
Are they getting married?

734
00:56:25,175 --> 00:56:27,719
Well, Juanito's a good match.

735
00:56:30,972 --> 00:56:34,309
Look, why don't you
make the sandwiches yourself?

736
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:36,186
I want to see this.

737
00:56:36,394 --> 00:56:37,520
All right. Well...

738
00:56:39,147 --> 00:56:42,859
Thanks for everything,
and give my bible to Manolo.

739
00:56:44,611 --> 00:56:45,862
Don't be silly.

740
00:56:52,994 --> 00:56:55,747
I was married by a bishop,
he was my uncle.

741
00:56:55,997 --> 00:56:59,125
You wouldn't have an uncle
who's a bishop?

742
00:56:59,334 --> 00:57:01,878
- Or even better, a cardinal.
- No, I don't.

743
00:57:02,295 --> 00:57:03,922
- Can Juanito come in?
- No.

744
00:57:04,130 --> 00:57:05,548
He's your fiancé.

745
00:57:05,799 --> 00:57:09,219
What a precious dress.
It looks lovely on you.

746
00:57:09,427 --> 00:57:10,804
Isn't she beautiful?

747
00:57:11,012 --> 00:57:15,809
But she doesn't have an uncle
who's a bishop. It's a shame.

748
00:57:16,017 --> 00:57:18,853
It's the sacrament
that matters, isn't it?

749
00:57:19,187 --> 00:57:22,065
Of course, but with a bishop
it looks better.

750
00:57:22,315 --> 00:57:24,192
What about the honeymoon?

751
00:57:24,442 --> 00:57:25,485
Mother says...

752
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:27,821
...we should go to Rome.
What do you say?

753
00:57:28,863 --> 00:57:31,783
She'll love seeing the Pope
and the catacombs.

754
00:57:32,033 --> 00:57:34,661
- I don't know.
- We could go to Paris too.

755
00:57:34,869 --> 00:57:38,706
I mean about the wedding.
Can we wait for the Republic?

756
00:57:40,041 --> 00:57:41,793
Because when
there's a Republic,...

757
00:57:42,043 --> 00:57:44,796
...then we'll be able
to get a divorce.

758
00:57:45,046 --> 00:57:48,007
My son divorced? Never!
Take off the dress!

759
00:57:48,258 --> 00:57:50,301
Give it to me,
you shameless woman!

760
00:57:54,222 --> 00:57:57,600
With great pleasure!
And you can stick it...

761
00:57:58,643 --> 00:57:59,894
...up your ass!

762
00:58:00,728 --> 00:58:03,690
- Rocio, please.
- And the veil with it.

763
00:58:03,940 --> 00:58:06,860
- What a filthy tongue!
- Calm down, Mother!

764
00:58:08,194 --> 00:58:09,946
Grab her by the legs!

765
00:58:13,283 --> 00:58:15,535
She'll be over it by tomorrow.

766
00:58:15,785 --> 00:58:17,954
Go away. And never come back!

767
00:58:18,204 --> 00:58:20,623
But I didn't do anything,
it was her.

768
00:58:24,502 --> 00:58:26,963
Juanito! I’m taking you
to a monastery!

769
00:58:34,304 --> 00:58:36,139
Calm down, Doña Asun!

770
00:59:37,575 --> 00:59:40,745
Fernando, I’m so unhappy!

771
00:59:41,579 --> 00:59:42,705
Don't cry.

772
00:59:51,256 --> 00:59:53,007
You're so kind!

773
01:00:00,848 --> 01:00:01,933
The door...

774
01:00:02,684 --> 01:00:05,436
Never mind the door.
Come here, you devil.

775
01:00:05,687 --> 01:00:07,313
You're a real devil.

776
01:00:16,990 --> 01:00:18,157
Your trousers...

777
01:00:38,928 --> 01:00:41,180
- What was that?
- The wind. Keep going!

778
01:00:58,656 --> 01:01:01,701
And I, like an idiot,
making him omelets!

779
01:01:37,195 --> 01:01:38,946
What? Didn't you enjoy it?

780
01:01:40,281 --> 01:01:41,949
Of course I did.

781
01:01:42,992 --> 01:01:45,370
But how am I going
to tell your father?

782
01:01:45,578 --> 01:01:46,537
Tell him what?

783
01:01:48,790 --> 01:01:50,667
That I’m in love with you.

784
01:01:52,502 --> 01:01:54,045
Why should you tell him?

785
01:01:56,297 --> 01:01:58,841
If I don't,
I'm abusing his trust.

786
01:01:59,300 --> 01:02:01,552
If you do, you're abusing mine.

787
01:02:03,179 --> 01:02:04,555
I don't understand.

788
01:02:04,806 --> 01:02:05,640
Juanito...

789
01:02:07,308 --> 01:02:09,936
What? So you love him then?

790
01:02:10,395 --> 01:02:11,562
It's not that, but...

791
01:02:14,816 --> 01:02:17,110
What are you doing?
Where are you going?

792
01:02:20,029 --> 01:02:21,114
To Madrid!

793
01:02:59,569 --> 01:03:01,946
Have you read
"The Magic Mountain"?

794
01:03:02,572 --> 01:03:05,950
It's all explained very well
in that book.

795
01:03:07,660 --> 01:03:10,830
"Oh, charming
organic beauty,...

796
01:03:11,956 --> 01:03:14,751
...composed not of painting
nor of stone,...

797
01:03:15,293 --> 01:03:18,921
...but of living
and corruptible matter!

798
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:22,216
Look at the shoulders
and hips,...

799
01:03:23,176 --> 01:03:27,054
...and the flowery bosoms
on both sides of the breast,...

800
01:03:27,388 --> 01:03:30,516
...and the ribs
aligned in pairs,...

801
01:03:31,058 --> 01:03:34,020
...and the navel in
the belly's softness,...

802
01:03:34,896 --> 01:03:38,065
...and the dark sex
between the thighs!

803
01:03:39,233 --> 01:03:42,195
Let me feel the exhalation
of your pores,...

804
01:03:43,029 --> 01:03:44,781
...and touch your down,...

805
01:03:45,698 --> 01:03:49,869
...human image of water
and albumen,...

806
01:03:50,620 --> 01:03:53,664
...destined to the anatomy
of the tomb,...

807
01:03:55,208 --> 01:03:56,876
...and let me die...

808
01:03:57,835 --> 01:04:00,797
...with my lips
pressed to yours!"

809
01:04:03,716 --> 01:04:05,259
Such youth!

810
01:04:05,510 --> 01:04:06,969
Gee up, Lucero!

811
01:04:18,523 --> 01:04:19,482
Don Luis!

812
01:04:20,858 --> 01:04:23,528
- What's the hurry?
- I must talk to you.

813
01:04:24,779 --> 01:04:27,406
What do I have to do
to renounce?

814
01:04:27,740 --> 01:04:29,116
Renounce what?

815
01:04:29,575 --> 01:04:32,620
This! Catholicism!
I’ll pay anything!

816
01:04:32,870 --> 01:04:35,414
You've just blessed yourself!

817
01:04:35,665 --> 01:04:38,292
It's finished! What do I do?
Spit on you?

818
01:04:38,501 --> 01:04:40,336
Blaspheme?
Sing the Republican Anthem?

819
01:04:40,545 --> 01:04:42,129
If the priests only knew...

820
01:04:42,380 --> 01:04:45,216
.. the beating they'll get,
they'd run out shouting...

821
01:04:45,550 --> 01:04:47,301
...freedom, freedom!

822
01:04:47,844 --> 01:04:49,637
I can't stand my mother!

823
01:04:49,971 --> 01:04:51,013
I want to be free!

824
01:04:51,347 --> 01:04:52,431
Free!

825
01:04:53,140 --> 01:04:55,726
Your mother is
one heck of a mother, Juanito.

826
01:04:56,060 --> 01:04:57,436
What's going on?

827
01:04:57,770 --> 01:05:01,315
She wants me to be a monk!
And I want to get married!

828
01:05:01,691 --> 01:05:02,942
That's fine.

829
01:05:03,317 --> 01:05:05,653
So why do you want to renounce?

830
01:05:05,987 --> 01:05:09,365
If I do, Mother will disown me
and I can marry Rocio!

831
01:05:09,615 --> 01:05:11,826
If you put it like that...

832
01:05:11,993 --> 01:05:16,163
But defection is
a very serious matter, Juanito.

833
01:05:16,414 --> 01:05:18,749
So is the vow of chastity!

834
01:05:19,083 --> 01:05:20,877
Christ, you're telling me?

835
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:22,670
I’m sorry.

836
01:05:23,296 --> 01:05:24,964
Do you believe in Hell?

837
01:05:25,381 --> 01:05:27,174
I do, but she doesn't!

838
01:05:31,721 --> 01:05:35,641
Tell me what I have to do
and give me the certificate.

839
01:05:36,017 --> 01:05:37,059
What certificate?

840
01:05:37,310 --> 01:05:39,854
To show I’ve left
the Catholic Church.

841
01:05:40,187 --> 01:05:43,858
Then Rocio can see
I’ve split with my mother,...

842
01:05:44,066 --> 01:05:45,985
...and she'll marry me.
You see?

843
01:05:46,861 --> 01:05:50,239
It must be lunch time.
Come on, let's go.

844
01:05:50,448 --> 01:05:52,909
Don't I have to do it here?

845
01:05:53,659 --> 01:05:55,411
Just be quiet. Come along.

846
01:05:56,162 --> 01:05:58,414
You, give me a hand.
Hold the horse.

847
01:06:05,630 --> 01:06:08,090
- Where are we going?
- For lunch.

848
01:06:09,133 --> 01:06:12,887
- And the certificate?
- I’ll do it verbally, dammit!

849
01:06:18,059 --> 01:06:19,185
Good afternoon!

850
01:06:20,353 --> 01:06:23,397
Well, the Church and money,
hand in hand.

851
01:06:23,731 --> 01:06:26,025
Rocio, just listen to this.

852
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:29,445
I must tell you
that this man has renounced...

853
01:06:29,695 --> 01:06:30,947
...the Holy Church,...

854
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:33,032
...and is excommunicated.

855
01:06:33,366 --> 01:06:34,241
What's for lunch?

856
01:06:36,494 --> 01:06:38,329
Wonderful, stew!

857
01:06:39,205 --> 01:06:40,539
What is all this?

858
01:06:41,082 --> 01:06:42,500
You explain it.

859
01:06:42,708 --> 01:06:46,087
Excommunicated for your love.
I’ll go to Hell.

860
01:06:46,295 --> 01:06:47,505
Don't touch me!

861
01:06:47,713 --> 01:06:50,424
Your mother's the only one
you care about!

862
01:06:50,675 --> 01:06:53,844
Don't you understand?
That's why I renounced!

863
01:06:54,095 --> 01:06:55,638
My love, let me explain.

864
01:06:55,888 --> 01:06:57,056
What's happened?

865
01:06:58,599 --> 01:07:01,686
Nothing. Juanito showed
he's got balls.

866
01:07:01,894 --> 01:07:05,064
Excuse me. He renounced.

867
01:07:05,272 --> 01:07:08,275
- He's free of the maternal yoke.
- The Carlists have class.

868
01:07:09,026 --> 01:07:10,069
Does he mean it?

869
01:07:10,611 --> 01:07:13,489
Is there any soup left?
Stew really needs soup.

870
01:07:13,823 --> 01:07:14,865
I’ll get it now!

871
01:07:15,241 --> 01:07:18,494
How am I going to allow
such a stupidity?

872
01:07:19,745 --> 01:07:23,666
Even if I did, as soon
as his mother heard about it...

873
01:07:24,333 --> 01:07:25,584
She'll kill him.

874
01:07:26,002 --> 01:07:28,754
That's the least of it.
She'll disinherit him.

875
01:07:29,130 --> 01:07:31,173
Don't laugh at him.

876
01:07:31,632 --> 01:07:35,386
hat he just did
only happens in novels.

877
01:07:45,312 --> 01:07:47,189
My mother doesn't count!

878
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:50,609
She's right out!
We can honeymoon in Paris!

879
01:07:51,068 --> 01:07:53,821
- Can we live in Madrid?
- Wherever you want!

880
01:07:54,155 --> 01:07:55,114
Honestly?

881
01:07:55,656 --> 01:07:57,825
Because I won't live here.

882
01:07:58,075 --> 01:08:01,537
And in the summer
We'll go to San Sebastian!

883
01:08:06,375 --> 01:08:08,627
- Don't take it so hard.
- What?

884
01:08:09,128 --> 01:08:11,005
Do you think I’m stupid?

885
01:08:11,672 --> 01:08:14,008
Juanito! Not now!

886
01:08:22,975 --> 01:08:26,145
So you're still here,
eating your heart out.

887
01:08:30,608 --> 01:08:34,070
Look, can't Rocio marry
whoever she wants?

888
01:08:34,403 --> 01:08:36,572
- She doesn't love him!
- She does.

889
01:08:36,906 --> 01:08:39,283
In her own way, of course.

890
01:08:39,617 --> 01:08:42,912
And she has to get married,
unlike Violeta.

891
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:44,246
Obviously not!

892
01:08:44,455 --> 01:08:47,541
No. What I mean is
that Violeta's a vet.

893
01:08:47,750 --> 01:08:50,920
She's got a good job
and doesn't need anybody.

894
01:08:51,128 --> 01:08:54,173
But what can Rocio do
without any training?

895
01:08:54,590 --> 01:08:56,759
Be a shopgirl all her life?

896
01:08:57,093 --> 01:08:58,636
Isn't she a secretary?

897
01:08:58,844 --> 01:09:03,432
No, poor thing. She helps me
in the shop my husband left me.

898
01:09:03,641 --> 01:09:05,059
Because my husband...

899
01:09:09,396 --> 01:09:11,357
- Why did you bring me here?
- Who, me?

900
01:09:11,732 --> 01:09:13,692
No, it wasn't you, it was me.

901
01:09:14,068 --> 01:09:16,403
No, it wasn't me either.
It was my feet.

902
01:09:16,737 --> 01:09:17,822
My own feet.

903
01:09:20,533 --> 01:09:22,326
He drowned right there.

904
01:09:24,370 --> 01:09:25,204
Your husband?

905
01:09:26,664 --> 01:09:29,708
Last summer.
We came here on a picnic.

906
01:09:30,459 --> 01:09:34,004
I insisted that we should
have a swim after lunch.

907
01:09:35,548 --> 01:09:38,425
And he got a cramp.

908
01:09:39,260 --> 01:09:41,095
I can still see it, even now.

909
01:09:42,763 --> 01:09:44,807
He was there, right there.

910
01:09:48,144 --> 01:09:50,229
And all of a sudden,
he went under.

911
01:09:53,149 --> 01:09:54,942
And he never came up.

912
01:09:55,484 --> 01:09:58,070
I, like an idiot,
thought he was diving.

913
01:10:01,407 --> 01:10:04,660
And he left me all alone!
Alone for ever!

914
01:10:06,704 --> 01:10:09,748
But you've got your father,...

915
01:10:10,291 --> 01:10:11,667
...your sisters.

916
01:10:14,712 --> 01:10:15,963
But, Fernando,...

917
01:10:16,589 --> 01:10:18,966
...a husband is a husband!

918
01:10:21,093 --> 01:10:24,555
Yes, I understand.
But you could marry again.

919
01:10:26,098 --> 01:10:27,558
Young...

920
01:10:30,603 --> 01:10:31,770
So nice...

921
01:10:34,481 --> 01:10:35,983
So pretty...

922
01:10:38,027 --> 01:10:39,987
Look, Clara,
from the start...

923
01:10:40,446 --> 01:10:42,281
No, I’m a decent woman.

924
01:10:43,032 --> 01:10:43,699
Sure.

925
01:10:44,116 --> 01:10:45,201
You're crazy.

926
01:10:45,534 --> 01:10:46,410
I’ll comfort you.

927
01:10:46,744 --> 01:10:47,786
Not by the river!

928
01:10:51,415 --> 01:10:53,209
Oh Jesus! Fernando!

929
01:10:54,919 --> 01:10:55,586
Help!

930
01:10:56,045 --> 01:10:58,088
Wait! Lord, what can I do?

931
01:10:59,340 --> 01:11:00,507
Get a rope!

932
01:11:00,841 --> 01:11:02,676
Where will I find one?

933
01:11:03,135 --> 01:11:03,886
I’m drowning!

934
01:11:04,220 --> 01:11:05,679
No, not you, Fernando!

935
01:11:13,854 --> 01:11:14,897
Grab this!

936
01:11:15,439 --> 01:11:16,690
Hold on tight!

937
01:11:17,983 --> 01:11:19,235
Please, hold on!

938
01:11:20,861 --> 01:11:22,154
I’m so sorry!

939
01:11:25,074 --> 01:11:27,534
Give me your hand!
Don't let go!

940
01:11:31,288 --> 01:11:33,040
My God! Come on.

941
01:11:48,180 --> 01:11:49,974
Water. I swallowed water.

942
01:11:50,182 --> 01:11:53,227
Forgive me, forgive me.
Kiss me, my darling.

943
01:11:56,480 --> 01:12:00,150
It was my fault. Are you
better? Tell me you're better.

944
01:12:00,359 --> 01:12:02,278
I am. I'm better.

945
01:12:03,821 --> 01:12:06,073
- Yes, like that.
- Not by the river.

946
01:12:07,825 --> 01:12:08,867
Oh, my God!

947
01:12:10,119 --> 01:12:11,578
Yes, Fernando, yes!

948
01:12:13,914 --> 01:12:16,667
I don't know
what's happening to me.

949
01:12:26,635 --> 01:12:29,430
- Bunch of scoundrels.
- How did you get it?

950
01:12:29,638 --> 01:12:31,265
It came from Madrid.

951
01:12:31,515 --> 01:12:33,183
The end is the best.

952
01:12:33,517 --> 01:12:36,228
" You must ensure that
the monarchist triumph...

953
01:12:36,437 --> 01:12:39,523
...gives the impression
of being true public opinion."

954
01:12:39,732 --> 01:12:42,109
- Who's it from?
- The Ministry of the Interior.

955
01:12:42,359 --> 01:12:44,611
They're rigging the elections.

956
01:12:44,862 --> 01:12:46,322
- No!
- How dare they!

957
01:12:46,655 --> 01:12:48,532
- Why don't you go too?
- Where?

958
01:12:48,741 --> 01:12:51,994
- To the meeting in Villabuena.
- I’m not a Republican!

959
01:12:52,202 --> 01:12:52,911
Some defector!

960
01:12:53,245 --> 01:12:55,622
Now, you wouldn't be
putting me on?

961
01:12:55,956 --> 01:12:58,625
No, I’m going.
I’ll go anywhere.

962
01:13:03,047 --> 01:13:05,215
Wait for me, I’m going too!

963
01:13:12,348 --> 01:13:13,807
Goodbye, Rocio!

964
01:13:23,317 --> 01:13:25,361
Wait! Don't go! Don't go!

965
01:13:26,987 --> 01:13:28,280
What happened?

966
01:13:28,614 --> 01:13:30,157
Fernando fell in the water.

967
01:13:30,366 --> 01:13:31,450
- In the water?
- Where?

968
01:13:31,784 --> 01:13:33,077
In the river, of course.

969
01:13:33,619 --> 01:13:35,954
And why did you go
to the river?

970
01:13:37,915 --> 01:13:41,210
We went for a walk.
Fernando had never been there.

971
01:13:41,418 --> 01:13:45,255
- Now he's caught a chill.
- Some chill. It's pneumonia.

972
01:13:45,506 --> 01:13:48,133
- But how did it happen?
- For Christ's sake!

973
01:13:48,342 --> 01:13:50,427
Why all this inquisition?

974
01:13:50,636 --> 01:13:52,679
Get me to bed. I’m shivering.

975
01:13:52,888 --> 01:13:56,266
You've got an awful fever.
Dry off and go to bed.

976
01:13:56,517 --> 01:13:58,977
- That's what I said.
- Cover up well.

977
01:13:59,186 --> 01:14:02,773
Wouldn't it be better
if he had a hot bath first?

978
01:14:02,981 --> 01:14:04,400
Why not call the doctor?

979
01:14:04,691 --> 01:14:07,945
All he needs is hot milk
with brandy and an aspirin.

980
01:14:08,153 --> 01:14:10,406
- We've no brandy.
- There's only anisette.

981
01:14:10,656 --> 01:14:12,574
I don't think it's the same.

982
01:14:12,783 --> 01:14:15,452
- Fill hot water bottles.
- For his feet!

983
01:14:15,661 --> 01:14:19,581
- Shouldn't he inhale eucalyptus?
- He has to sweat.

984
01:14:20,457 --> 01:14:22,543
Did you fall too, or what?

985
01:14:22,751 --> 01:14:26,255
That's from pulling him
out of the river.

986
01:14:26,463 --> 01:14:30,467
It's strange, he fell in
just where Higinio drowned.

987
01:14:30,676 --> 01:14:34,012
- You can imagine how I felt.
- Luz, the anisette.

988
01:14:41,728 --> 01:14:43,105
Just listen to this.

989
01:14:43,564 --> 01:14:47,734
The sneak wanted to kiss me
and I had to push him away.

990
01:14:52,573 --> 01:14:54,324
I just can't explain it.

991
01:14:54,575 --> 01:14:57,995
What with remembering Higinio
and Fernando kissing me,...

992
01:14:58,203 --> 01:14:59,830
...l felt strange all over.

993
01:15:00,205 --> 01:15:02,833
And he was so keen
to go to the meeting.

994
01:15:03,667 --> 01:15:05,836
Go on, pretend.

995
01:15:06,086 --> 01:15:09,131
You sent me away
so I wouldn't hear something.

996
01:15:09,381 --> 01:15:11,633
What would we be talking about?

997
01:15:11,884 --> 01:15:13,844
What else but Fernando?

998
01:15:14,678 --> 01:15:16,763
But if I find out, you'll see.

999
01:15:18,098 --> 01:15:21,685
- Are you better?
- It's pneumonia, believe me.

1000
01:15:21,894 --> 01:15:25,063
Stop moaning and take
the aspirins and milk.

1001
01:15:25,272 --> 01:15:26,857
Shouldn't he inhale first?

1002
01:15:27,107 --> 01:15:28,775
Wait, I’ll get the bottles.

1003
01:15:29,818 --> 01:15:31,069
His feet are freezing!

1004
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:34,198
And his forehead's burning.
Now, sit up.

1005
01:15:35,616 --> 01:15:38,368
Breathe deeply,
this will really help.

1006
01:15:43,916 --> 01:15:46,251
It reminds me
of the water I swallowed.

1007
01:15:46,460 --> 01:15:48,378
Give him the milk
and aspirins.

1008
01:15:57,221 --> 01:15:58,972
Now, sweat it out.

1009
01:15:59,431 --> 01:16:01,183
No, he's freezing.

1010
01:16:01,517 --> 01:16:04,102
Don't worry, love.
He'll soon warm up.

1011
01:16:04,811 --> 01:16:06,271
Thank you so much.

1012
01:16:07,648 --> 01:16:09,566
You're very kind.

1013
01:16:09,816 --> 01:16:11,485
We'll let him sleep.

1014
01:16:11,652 --> 01:16:13,612
- Get well.
- Keep covered up.

1015
01:16:37,970 --> 01:16:40,138
- Health and the Republic!
- Health!

1016
01:16:40,472 --> 01:16:44,309
- Down with the clergy!
- Want me to get out and hit you?

1017
01:16:48,981 --> 01:16:53,485
He doesn't know me. Tomorrow
I’ll burn his church again.

1018
01:16:55,696 --> 01:16:58,073
- See you tomorrow.
- What do you mean?

1019
01:16:59,324 --> 01:17:00,951
Aren't you going home?

1020
01:17:01,201 --> 01:17:03,912
I’ve renounced my religion,
turned Republican,...

1021
01:17:04,121 --> 01:17:05,789
...and damned the clergy.

1022
01:17:06,123 --> 01:17:08,458
Am I supposed to go home,
kiss my mother,...

1023
01:17:08,709 --> 01:17:11,753
...and say my prayers
before I go to bed?

1024
01:17:12,004 --> 01:17:13,839
No, I’m staying here.

1025
01:17:14,047 --> 01:17:17,884
- All right. Where will you sleep?
- On the sofa.

1026
01:17:44,953 --> 01:17:47,080
- It's me, your love.
- What is this?

1027
01:17:47,289 --> 01:17:49,916
- You'll waken Luz.
- What do you want?

1028
01:17:50,167 --> 01:17:51,501
You're so warm.

1029
01:17:52,461 --> 01:17:55,172
Know what? We don't
have to get married.

1030
01:17:55,380 --> 01:17:57,799
In the Republic
there'll be free love.

1031
01:17:58,050 --> 01:17:59,509
Free love?

1032
01:18:00,052 --> 01:18:03,305
Someone said so at the meeting.
Ask your father.

1033
01:18:06,642 --> 01:18:07,392
What?

1034
01:18:07,643 --> 01:18:08,727
What's going on?

1035
01:18:11,271 --> 01:18:14,107
It's this selfish lump.
He wants free love.

1036
01:18:14,316 --> 01:18:18,153
You pig! That's why
you became a Republican!

1037
01:18:18,612 --> 01:18:20,238
Rocio! Let me explain!

1038
01:18:20,781 --> 01:18:22,032
Rocio, open the door!

1039
01:18:22,282 --> 01:18:26,244
We're finished forever.
Do you hear me? Forever!

1040
01:18:28,288 --> 01:18:29,956
I take it all back!

1041
01:18:31,208 --> 01:18:32,751
I won't renounce.

1042
01:18:34,086 --> 01:18:36,338
Roman, Catholic, Apostolic!

1043
01:18:39,174 --> 01:18:43,136
And never a Republican!
I’m a Carlist till I die!

1044
01:18:45,806 --> 01:18:49,559
Did you see that? Getting
into my bed like a ghost.

1045
01:18:50,394 --> 01:18:52,938
So what? If you're going
to marry him...

1046
01:18:53,313 --> 01:18:56,108
You're crazy.
Don't even mention it.

1047
01:18:56,608 --> 01:18:58,402
I want everyone to know!

1048
01:19:02,322 --> 01:19:03,699
I take it all back!

1049
01:19:05,033 --> 01:19:08,495
Our fathers died for God,
for fatherland and King.

1050
01:19:08,745 --> 01:19:11,081
For that same cause
we too shall die.

1051
01:19:11,331 --> 01:19:12,874
Die then, you idiot!

1052
01:19:14,543 --> 01:19:17,796
Cost what it may,
King Don Carlos...

1053
01:19:18,130 --> 01:19:21,299
...must enter through
the gates of Madrid.

1054
01:19:22,634 --> 01:19:23,885
At last!

1055
01:19:24,928 --> 01:19:27,597
- Where are you going?
- For some water.

1056
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:34,813
Not the river.

1057
01:19:35,230 --> 01:19:37,190
No, I can't swim.

1058
01:19:38,150 --> 01:19:40,652
I can't swim. I can't swim.

1059
01:19:42,696 --> 01:19:45,532
Clara... Clara...
Not the river!

1060
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:53,832
Lie down. Take it easy.

1061
01:19:54,583 --> 01:19:55,917
Not the river.

1062
01:19:58,086 --> 01:19:59,254
The hay loft.

1063
01:20:00,088 --> 01:20:01,131
The hay loft.

1064
01:20:03,884 --> 01:20:05,343
I love you, Violeta.

1065
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:09,639
I want to marry Rocio.

1066
01:20:11,892 --> 01:20:12,934
Rocio...

1067
01:20:14,394 --> 01:20:15,228
Clara...

1068
01:20:16,271 --> 01:20:17,355
Violeta...

1069
01:20:17,689 --> 01:20:18,982
What about me?

1070
01:20:22,819 --> 01:20:24,070
No, not the water!

1071
01:21:11,076 --> 01:21:13,829
In a mystical country,...

1072
01:21:14,079 --> 01:21:16,122
...there lived
an old artist,...

1073
01:21:16,373 --> 01:21:18,625
...who had all his wealth...

1074
01:21:18,875 --> 01:21:21,336
...in a magic flute.

1075
01:21:21,545 --> 01:21:24,130
The wretched flutist...

1076
01:21:24,381 --> 01:21:26,508
...was so very poor...

1077
01:21:26,758 --> 01:21:29,511
...that he slept
in the tree-tops,...

1078
01:21:29,761 --> 01:21:31,638
...because he had no home.

1079
01:21:31,972 --> 01:21:34,516
And the birds in the forest...

1080
01:21:35,350 --> 01:21:37,561
...came to wake him up.

1081
01:21:37,769 --> 01:21:39,104
And the birds...

1082
01:21:39,479 --> 01:21:42,649
...in the forest
came to wake him up.

1083
01:21:43,650 --> 01:21:48,113
And then the old flutist
sang in turn,...

1084
01:21:48,321 --> 01:21:53,076
...saying to the birds
with great pride...

1085
01:21:58,415 --> 01:21:59,541
Amalia!

1086
01:22:17,183 --> 01:22:18,143
Mother!

1087
01:22:19,686 --> 01:22:20,770
It's Mother!

1088
01:22:29,154 --> 01:22:32,782
...l too have flown
through life,...

1089
01:22:33,450 --> 01:22:37,621
...with no destination
and no nest in which to mate.

1090
01:22:41,625 --> 01:22:44,252
And you may sing...

1091
01:22:44,461 --> 01:22:46,212
...your love laments.

1092
01:22:46,838 --> 01:22:49,716
I will sing
of the bitterness...

1093
01:22:49,925 --> 01:22:52,510
...that lies within my heart.

1094
01:23:58,827 --> 01:24:01,997
Do you see, Danglard?
Prettier every year.

1095
01:24:03,748 --> 01:24:04,874
Amalia!

1096
01:24:06,543 --> 01:24:07,794
Manolo!

1097
01:24:24,644 --> 01:24:27,981
The operetta finished?
Tell him, darling.

1098
01:24:28,231 --> 01:24:31,026
Tell him how I had
America at my feet.

1099
01:24:31,276 --> 01:24:31,943
Tell us.

1100
01:24:32,152 --> 01:24:35,447
Indescribable successes
in Buenos Aires,...

1101
01:24:36,281 --> 01:24:39,034
...Montevideo,
Santiago de Chile,...

1102
01:24:39,284 --> 01:24:41,119
...Rio de Janeiro,
Caracas.

1103
01:24:41,369 --> 01:24:44,706
In Mexico they wanted
to carry me on their shoulders.

1104
01:24:44,914 --> 01:24:46,332
I refused, " naturellement".

1105
01:24:46,666 --> 01:24:50,045
- To avoid any groping, I suppose.
- Really, Dad.

1106
01:24:50,378 --> 01:24:52,047
No, he is right.

1107
01:24:52,255 --> 01:24:55,842
- You're an Othello.
- Of course, "Et j'en suis fier".

1108
01:24:56,176 --> 01:24:57,635
And you're right, dammit.

1109
01:24:57,886 --> 01:25:00,013
Are you going to tell them?

1110
01:25:00,388 --> 01:25:03,516
Packed theaters,
contracts extended,...

1111
01:25:03,850 --> 01:25:05,310
...tons of flowers.

1112
01:25:05,685 --> 01:25:06,936
Did you get rich?

1113
01:25:07,270 --> 01:25:10,190
He did.
I am an artiste.

1114
01:25:10,398 --> 01:25:12,233
Huge expenses...

1115
01:25:13,026 --> 01:25:16,279
- The French toast is delicious.
- Wonderful.

1116
01:25:16,529 --> 01:25:18,156
When did you learn to cook?

1117
01:25:18,531 --> 01:25:19,449
Who them?

1118
01:25:19,699 --> 01:25:23,078
Fernando made them. He was
a cook in the seminary.

1119
01:25:23,703 --> 01:25:27,373
Handsome, polite, helpful.

1120
01:25:28,500 --> 01:25:30,460
This young man is a jewel.

1121
01:25:31,002 --> 01:25:33,254
It was time
you had a proper friend.

1122
01:25:33,713 --> 01:25:36,674
I hope you're not a drinker.

1123
01:25:37,008 --> 01:25:37,884
No, ma'am.

1124
01:25:38,927 --> 01:25:40,178
Wonderful.

1125
01:25:40,428 --> 01:25:41,679
Now, please excuse me.

1126
01:25:41,930 --> 01:25:45,266
The journey was tiring
and I wish to rest.

1127
01:25:46,893 --> 01:25:51,064
- See you later, my love.
- I’ll stay with Manolo.

1128
01:25:52,607 --> 01:25:55,568
- And our presents?
- Later, when I unpack.

1129
01:25:55,777 --> 01:25:58,613
- Your daughter is selfish.
- It's her age.

1130
01:25:59,447 --> 01:26:00,824
A kiss, Violeta.

1131
01:26:01,449 --> 01:26:02,826
Have a good rest.

1132
01:26:03,535 --> 01:26:05,995
You poor little thing.
So young and...

1133
01:26:06,371 --> 01:26:08,331
But I feel wonderful!

1134
01:26:08,540 --> 01:26:12,794
Listen to me.
Enjoy yourself, life is short.

1135
01:26:14,838 --> 01:26:18,007
Thank you for breakfast.
It was delicious.

1136
01:26:18,967 --> 01:26:19,592
Coming?

1137
01:26:19,968 --> 01:26:21,219
No, not you.

1138
01:26:23,346 --> 01:26:24,305
What about me?

1139
01:26:25,056 --> 01:26:28,059
Go for a walk,
take some air,...

1140
01:26:28,268 --> 01:26:30,603
...and enjoy nature.

1141
01:26:38,611 --> 01:26:39,654
" Non e giusto!"

1142
01:26:40,488 --> 01:26:41,656
" Non e giusto!"

1143
01:26:45,201 --> 01:26:49,539
- Mr. Danglard, don't get upset.
- I knew this would happen.

1144
01:26:49,789 --> 01:26:51,332
Would you like a drink?

1145
01:26:53,001 --> 01:26:54,460
Why is he crying?

1146
01:26:54,794 --> 01:26:57,672
Idiot! Can't you see
he's Mother's lover?

1147
01:27:02,510 --> 01:27:05,346
Don't go, Mr. Danglard.
That'll be worse.

1148
01:27:13,313 --> 01:27:14,939
What a hurry you're in.

1149
01:27:15,690 --> 01:27:17,150
Just wait...

1150
01:27:19,444 --> 01:27:22,697
I can't. I've been waiting
for almost a year.

1151
01:27:22,947 --> 01:27:24,199
Amalia...

1152
01:27:24,449 --> 01:27:26,576
Christ, what a nuisance.

1153
01:27:30,038 --> 01:27:31,289
What is it?

1154
01:27:31,623 --> 01:27:36,002
Listen, wouldn't it be better
if you and I had a rest now?

1155
01:27:36,252 --> 01:27:40,298
No, and if you make a scene
I’ll leave you for Manolo.

1156
01:27:40,548 --> 01:27:41,591
No, don't do that!

1157
01:27:42,342 --> 01:27:44,886
Listen, I won't be long.

1158
01:27:45,428 --> 01:27:48,598
Why torture yourself
when we have forever.

1159
01:27:48,848 --> 01:27:49,599
Really?

1160
01:27:49,933 --> 01:27:51,309
I swear that we do.

1161
01:27:51,726 --> 01:27:53,394
But now, go away.

1162
01:27:53,645 --> 01:27:55,188
Don't be too long.

1163
01:27:59,317 --> 01:28:00,985
I feel sorry for him.

1164
01:28:01,194 --> 01:28:05,031
I can understand him.
But he has to understand me.

1165
01:28:07,659 --> 01:28:11,079
Do you think
you're going to be able?

1166
01:28:11,287 --> 01:28:13,248
Am I going to be able?

1167
01:28:17,168 --> 01:28:18,628
Am I able or not?

1168
01:28:19,170 --> 01:28:20,922
I’ll say you are.

1169
01:28:21,297 --> 01:28:23,132
And at your age too.

1170
01:28:44,612 --> 01:28:47,031
- Who's that?
- Mother's manager.

1171
01:28:47,240 --> 01:28:50,368
- Great. Introduce me.
- Forget that and help us.

1172
01:28:50,702 --> 01:28:52,495
Well, introduce me later.

1173
01:28:52,829 --> 01:28:54,163
I haven't forgiven you.

1174
01:28:54,414 --> 01:28:58,376
But I don't want Mother
to know we've broken up.

1175
01:28:58,626 --> 01:29:01,296
- Don't worry
- And stop kissing me.

1176
01:29:01,504 --> 01:29:02,588
Danglard!

1177
01:29:02,839 --> 01:29:06,175
You said you'd just
be a minute. Four hours...

1178
01:29:06,426 --> 01:29:08,469
...and forty seven minutes!

1179
01:29:08,803 --> 01:29:09,971
You timed it?

1180
01:29:10,305 --> 01:29:13,474
You are not a gentleman!
You have no right...

1181
01:29:13,725 --> 01:29:16,686
...to do this to me."Vous me
devez une explication!"

1182
01:29:17,020 --> 01:29:20,273
- And you'll have one. Wait.
- Wait longer?

1183
01:29:20,523 --> 01:29:24,068
Poor Amalia is worn out,
let her sleep a little.

1184
01:29:24,277 --> 01:29:25,820
He says it so happily!

1185
01:29:26,154 --> 01:29:27,822
Your father has no shame!

1186
01:29:28,281 --> 01:29:31,534
You're right, Mr. Danglard.
Dad, the Republic has won!

1187
01:29:31,743 --> 01:29:33,703
- Is it definite?
- Absolutely!

1188
01:29:34,078 --> 01:29:36,914
- The town's gone crazy!
- Let's go celebrate!

1189
01:29:37,457 --> 01:29:38,916
Go get the flag!

1190
01:29:39,167 --> 01:29:41,210
I don't care about
your Republic!

1191
01:29:41,461 --> 01:29:42,920
I want an explanation!

1192
01:29:43,671 --> 01:29:46,007
What explanation do you want?

1193
01:29:46,466 --> 01:29:48,009
You're asking me?

1194
01:29:48,259 --> 01:29:50,428
I, who am wasting my fortune...

1195
01:29:50,762 --> 01:29:53,723
...so she can be happy
and sing?

1196
01:29:54,766 --> 01:29:57,518
You mean,
the tour of America...

1197
01:29:58,770 --> 01:30:00,313
A disaster.

1198
01:30:00,563 --> 01:30:04,108
Why don't they forbid it
once and for all?

1199
01:30:04,359 --> 01:30:04,859
What?

1200
01:30:05,109 --> 01:30:05,860
Operetta!

1201
01:30:07,904 --> 01:30:09,364
I’ve lost thousands.

1202
01:30:09,989 --> 01:30:13,826
The worst thing is,
when I’ve no more money...

1203
01:30:14,035 --> 01:30:15,453
...your wife will leave me.

1204
01:30:15,787 --> 01:30:19,457
No, she won't do that.
Amalia really loves you.

1205
01:30:20,792 --> 01:30:21,876
You think so?

1206
01:30:22,085 --> 01:30:23,044
She told me.

1207
01:30:23,586 --> 01:30:25,755
So why does she have to...

1208
01:30:26,089 --> 01:30:30,009
No, Danglard. If you weren't
so blinded by passion...

1209
01:30:30,218 --> 01:30:32,553
...you'd see that
I’m the cuckold.

1210
01:30:32,887 --> 01:30:33,262
You?

1211
01:30:33,596 --> 01:30:34,347
Of course!

1212
01:30:35,515 --> 01:30:37,058
Perhaps you're right.

1213
01:30:37,308 --> 01:30:41,354
Except for you, Amalia has
never been unfaithful to me.

1214
01:30:42,021 --> 01:30:44,148
Go and give her a kiss.

1215
01:30:44,399 --> 01:30:46,984
But, believe me,
you don't deserve her.

1216
01:31:00,665 --> 01:31:01,916
Gee up, Lucero!

1217
01:31:02,125 --> 01:31:05,294
The King has only
got a paper crown.

1218
01:31:05,628 --> 01:31:08,297
Berenguer took away
his gold one!

1219
01:31:08,631 --> 01:31:12,802
Why did I throw him out?
He tried to get into my bed!

1220
01:31:13,136 --> 01:31:14,011
You were right.

1221
01:31:14,262 --> 01:31:17,348
Because men, especially
men like Juanito,...

1222
01:31:17,557 --> 01:31:19,809
...once they've deflowered
a girl,...

1223
01:31:20,143 --> 01:31:21,811
...that's the end of it.

1224
01:31:22,061 --> 01:31:23,813
- You are a...?
- Of course!

1225
01:31:24,230 --> 01:31:26,107
What about you, Violeta?

1226
01:31:27,066 --> 01:31:28,025
May I?

1227
01:31:28,901 --> 01:31:32,155
What a nuisance!
Now what is it?

1228
01:31:32,488 --> 01:31:35,950
Nothing. I just wanted
you to know I'm here.

1229
01:31:36,284 --> 01:31:38,453
All right, I know.

1230
01:31:38,870 --> 01:31:41,747
Now will you let me
enjoy my daughters?

1231
01:31:41,998 --> 01:31:44,834
Of course.
But you know that I’m here.

1232
01:31:47,795 --> 01:31:51,591
See? If I met a man like him,
I might even consider it.

1233
01:31:51,799 --> 01:31:54,260
You've got him
round your little finger.

1234
01:31:54,594 --> 01:31:57,221
If I could have done that
with your father!

1235
01:31:57,430 --> 01:32:00,391
No, dear. Marriage wouldn't
suit you at all.

1236
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:02,560
You weren't born for that.

1237
01:32:02,894 --> 01:32:06,063
I mean, men are all selfish.

1238
01:32:06,397 --> 01:32:09,942
You should find a nice girl
Who'll love you,...

1239
01:32:10,151 --> 01:32:12,195
...and keep house for you.

1240
01:32:13,446 --> 01:32:15,031
Now, you...

1241
01:32:15,239 --> 01:32:17,992
Don't any men
come into your shop?

1242
01:32:18,242 --> 01:32:20,161
Of course they do!

1243
01:32:20,369 --> 01:32:23,998
But they're old.
Only old people have money.

1244
01:32:24,248 --> 01:32:25,291
What will you do?

1245
01:32:25,541 --> 01:32:30,379
You realize that if you don't
stay pretty they won't bother?

1246
01:32:30,630 --> 01:32:31,380
And you?

1247
01:32:31,839 --> 01:32:35,801
What do you say, my love?
I’ll kiss you to pieces.

1248
01:32:36,928 --> 01:32:39,096
Nobody pays me any attention.

1249
01:32:39,639 --> 01:32:41,307
And they're all selfish.

1250
01:32:41,641 --> 01:32:42,975
Didn't you realize?

1251
01:32:43,226 --> 01:32:44,268
What?

1252
01:32:45,019 --> 01:32:47,396
- Don't tell her!
- Mother, she's in love!

1253
01:32:47,730 --> 01:32:49,106
- You be quiet!
- With whom?

1254
01:32:49,815 --> 01:32:51,400
You'll all be sorry!

1255
01:32:52,568 --> 01:32:55,446
Who do you think?
With Fernando.

1256
01:32:55,988 --> 01:32:57,740
With the cook?

1257
01:33:20,179 --> 01:33:21,013
How is it?

1258
01:33:30,356 --> 01:33:31,315
Like it?

1259
01:33:32,858 --> 01:33:34,986
It's better than Higinio's.

1260
01:33:35,528 --> 01:33:37,989
Are you stupid? Have some tact.

1261
01:33:38,823 --> 01:33:40,783
See? Always scolding me!

1262
01:33:41,117 --> 01:33:42,285
What's the matter?

1263
01:33:43,119 --> 01:33:45,663
It's because Clara's husband
drowned here.

1264
01:33:45,913 --> 01:33:47,373
It's all right.

1265
01:33:48,708 --> 01:33:49,667
Let me try.

1266
01:33:56,632 --> 01:33:57,758
It's delicious!

1267
01:33:58,718 --> 01:34:00,177
Higinio's wasn't as good.

1268
01:34:07,810 --> 01:34:10,354
Why is the child
in such a tizzy?

1269
01:34:10,605 --> 01:34:13,024
Why do you think?
She's just spoiled.

1270
01:34:13,232 --> 01:34:15,401
Here are the basics
for the salad.

1271
01:34:15,943 --> 01:34:18,195
Has Violeta caught anything?

1272
01:34:18,946 --> 01:34:20,823
She hasn't come back yet.

1273
01:34:22,033 --> 01:34:25,703
I brought Mother along.
She's turned Republican!

1274
01:34:26,746 --> 01:34:27,705
I made this,...

1275
01:34:28,039 --> 01:34:29,165
...as the Bourbon is gone.

1276
01:34:29,373 --> 01:34:31,876
For the red and yellow,
I used jam.

1277
01:34:32,084 --> 01:34:34,503
But I had to use beetroot
for the purple.

1278
01:34:34,837 --> 01:34:37,006
Thank you on behalf
of the Republic.

1279
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:40,217
Republic! It'll be communism!

1280
01:34:40,551 --> 01:34:41,594
Don't say that!

1281
01:34:42,053 --> 01:34:43,012
It's true.

1282
01:34:43,471 --> 01:34:45,598
I’m heading back to Paris.

1283
01:34:46,474 --> 01:34:50,978
Yes, and I could sing
in New York, my lifelong dream.

1284
01:34:51,187 --> 01:34:54,607
With new settings and costumes,
and an orchestra...

1285
01:34:54,940 --> 01:34:57,151
...of at least
ninety musicians.

1286
01:34:57,485 --> 01:35:00,905
But Amalia, that will be
very expensive.

1287
01:35:01,113 --> 01:35:04,241
You'll soon recoup it
when they realize...

1288
01:35:04,992 --> 01:35:08,162
...Broadway is a washout
compared to the operetta.

1289
01:35:21,884 --> 01:35:24,553
Is Dona Amalia
a cabaret singer?

1290
01:35:29,975 --> 01:35:31,060
Leave me be!

1291
01:35:31,811 --> 01:35:35,147
What did I do?
Look, I'm worried about you.

1292
01:35:36,982 --> 01:35:37,858
Luz...

1293
01:35:38,651 --> 01:35:40,611
Leave me be, you're a pig!

1294
01:35:41,028 --> 01:35:42,196
But why?

1295
01:35:43,447 --> 01:35:46,409
- You always agree with them!
- With who?

1296
01:35:47,451 --> 01:35:49,286
Rocio! Clara! Violeta!

1297
01:35:50,121 --> 01:35:51,914
And as you don't like me...

1298
01:35:53,624 --> 01:35:54,709
I don't like you?

1299
01:35:55,418 --> 01:35:57,712
But I’ve liked you since
I first saw you!

1300
01:35:57,920 --> 01:36:01,090
Then why are you always
after those three?

1301
01:36:01,340 --> 01:36:02,800
You think I’m blind?

1302
01:36:03,634 --> 01:36:05,177
That's different.

1303
01:36:05,720 --> 01:36:08,097
Oh, yeah? Well, you can
go with them!

1304
01:36:14,145 --> 01:36:16,397
Don't you see it's you I love?

1305
01:36:17,356 --> 01:36:18,774
- Who, me?
- Yes, you.

1306
01:36:19,442 --> 01:36:20,234
Idiot!

1307
01:36:29,660 --> 01:36:31,036
Then...

1308
01:36:31,579 --> 01:36:33,038
What's going on?

1309
01:36:42,465 --> 01:36:44,425
My poor baby!

1310
01:36:58,689 --> 01:36:59,940
What are you watching?

1311
01:37:00,399 --> 01:37:02,568
They make such a nice couple.

1312
01:37:09,533 --> 01:37:11,368
First love...

1313
01:37:11,619 --> 01:37:15,080
So pure, so chaste,
so spiritual.

1314
01:37:22,630 --> 01:37:24,381
Spiritual, did you say?

1315
01:37:25,508 --> 01:37:27,760
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!

1316
01:37:28,010 --> 01:37:30,596
He's not to deflower her!

1317
01:37:30,805 --> 01:37:32,264
Damn seminarian.

1318
01:37:33,641 --> 01:37:36,477
- Are you crazy?
- It's just to scare them.

1319
01:37:39,230 --> 01:37:42,274
Now, to get them married!

1320
01:39:16,952 --> 01:39:17,995
But Luz...

1321
01:39:19,038 --> 01:39:20,497
I have to be sure.

1322
01:39:21,540 --> 01:39:24,501
- Sure of what?
- That you love me.

1323
01:39:25,961 --> 01:39:27,212
You know I do.

1324
01:39:29,465 --> 01:39:32,092
I don't want it to be
like with them.

1325
01:39:33,344 --> 01:39:34,219
Who?

1326
01:39:34,553 --> 01:39:36,305
With my sisters.

1327
01:39:39,141 --> 01:39:40,893
It's different with you.

1328
01:39:42,061 --> 01:39:44,313
That's what I want
to be sure of.

1329
01:39:45,356 --> 01:39:46,398
Come on.

1330
01:39:51,987 --> 01:39:53,948
After, if you don't love me,...

1331
01:39:54,782 --> 01:39:57,534
...there's still time
for you to leave.

1332
01:39:58,369 --> 01:40:00,746
And I’ll never tell anyone.

1333
01:40:05,793 --> 01:40:10,130
But first I want you to do
with me what you did with them.

1334
01:40:43,622 --> 01:40:46,166
- What's happened?
- Something awful.

1335
01:40:47,042 --> 01:40:48,002
It's awful.

1336
01:40:48,210 --> 01:40:50,295
- But what is it?
- Don Luis...

1337
01:40:54,717 --> 01:40:56,593
God's punishment, Manolo!

1338
01:41:01,849 --> 01:41:03,475
This is dreadful!

1339
01:41:14,570 --> 01:41:17,823
How could he hang himself?
He loved to eat.

1340
01:41:45,350 --> 01:41:47,644
" He who take his own life...

1341
01:41:48,353 --> 01:41:50,814
...removes his fear of death."

1342
01:41:56,195 --> 01:41:58,155
I think Shakespeare
said that.

1343
01:42:15,923 --> 01:42:17,674
Come on, hurry up.

1344
01:42:18,092 --> 01:42:20,052
- How do I look?
- Beautiful.

1345
01:42:30,896 --> 01:42:32,689
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!

1346
01:42:35,567 --> 01:42:38,112
- Now what do we do?
- Don't worry.

1347
01:42:39,446 --> 01:42:42,825
As Spain is now
a secular Republic,...

1348
01:42:43,242 --> 01:42:45,327
...consider
yourselves married.

1349
01:42:48,372 --> 01:42:53,127
Juanito, get the magistrate
to come and sort it out.

1350
01:42:56,255 --> 01:42:58,006
Manolo is right.

1351
01:42:58,257 --> 01:43:02,010
If you postpone the wedding,
We'll miss the boat.

1352
01:43:02,261 --> 01:43:05,931
We can't do that.
We open in Buenos Aires.

1353
01:43:06,849 --> 01:43:09,017
But I won't get to sing
" Ave Maria".

1354
01:43:09,268 --> 01:43:11,228
And I wanted so much
to do it.

1355
01:43:12,146 --> 01:43:13,105
Give her a kiss.

1356
01:43:13,355 --> 01:43:16,024
I’m waiting for
my first grandchild.

1357
01:43:29,413 --> 01:43:31,540
- Hurry, it's leaving!
- Come on!

1358
01:43:31,790 --> 01:43:33,167
Give me a kiss, Dad!

1359
01:43:33,375 --> 01:43:36,670
- Mother, write to us.
- Of course I will.

1360
01:43:37,296 --> 01:43:39,464
And find yourself a husband.

1361
01:43:51,685 --> 01:43:53,770
I hope you'll be very happy.

1362
01:43:56,982 --> 01:43:58,150
Very happy.

1363
01:44:02,946 --> 01:44:06,408
Take care of her or your
brother-in-law will fix you.

1364
01:44:09,620 --> 01:44:11,079
And I’m to be godfather.

1365
01:44:11,455 --> 01:44:12,706
You idiot!

1366
01:44:13,248 --> 01:44:14,416
Get on, it's moving.

1367
01:44:16,335 --> 01:44:20,297
Love brings pain,
but you had a good time.

1368
01:44:24,927 --> 01:44:27,012
What a rascal you are.

1369
01:44:33,352 --> 01:44:34,311
Goodbye!

1370
01:45:14,768 --> 01:45:18,355
To leave is to die a little,
the poet said.

1371
01:45:18,563 --> 01:45:20,357
I think it's the opposite.

1372
01:45:20,691 --> 01:45:22,985
The one left behind
dies completely.

1373
01:45:23,193 --> 01:45:25,570
Don't be silly.
Give me a kiss.

1374
01:45:27,322 --> 01:45:30,367
Have a good trip.
Give me a hug, Danglard.

1375
01:45:30,701 --> 01:45:33,287
As many as you want, my friend.

1376
01:45:43,714 --> 01:45:44,673
A kiss...

1377
01:45:46,008 --> 01:45:48,885
We're so sorry to be going,
aren't we?

1378
01:45:49,928 --> 01:45:52,097
Don't go then. Stay here.

1379
01:45:52,306 --> 01:45:53,974
It's for Fernando's future.

1380
01:45:55,017 --> 01:45:59,187
You're right. America is
the land of opportunities.

1381
01:46:00,105 --> 01:46:01,189
Get in the car.

1382
01:46:05,569 --> 01:46:08,238
Remember what I said when...

1383
01:46:08,947 --> 01:46:11,616
...I thought you were
in love with Violeta?

1384
01:46:12,659 --> 01:46:15,412
About gaining a son-in-law,
losing a friend?

1385
01:46:17,664 --> 01:46:18,623
That's it.

1386
01:46:20,459 --> 01:46:22,002
I’ll always be your friend.

1387
01:46:22,961 --> 01:46:24,421
Go on, get in.

1388
01:46:37,476 --> 01:46:38,727
Goodbye, Manolo.

1389
01:47:13,720 --> 01:47:15,347
Get up there, Lucero.
