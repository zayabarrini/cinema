1
00:02:47,727 --> 00:02:48,793
Great!

2
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,060
Wow!

3
00:02:50,195 --> 00:02:51,195
That's incredible.

4
00:02:51,329 --> 00:02:54,821
There's got to be
7 or 8 feet up there.

5
00:02:54,899 --> 00:02:56,833
And 80 years of dust.

6
00:02:56,901 --> 00:02:58,732
Look at all this height.

7
00:02:58,836 --> 00:03:00,030
With our bedroom upstairs,

8
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:01,400
we'd have all this space.

9
00:03:01,673 --> 00:03:02,765
For what?

10
00:03:02,874 --> 00:03:04,398
Just space.

11
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,334
1...

12
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:09,070
2...

13
00:03:09,214 --> 00:03:10,272
3!

14
00:03:12,016 --> 00:03:13,016
And 4?

15
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:16,980
And 5?

16
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:20,914
Watch it. Watch it.

17
00:03:21,059 --> 00:03:23,357
God, this place is huge.

18
00:03:23,461 --> 00:03:24,792
Wow.

19
00:03:26,197 --> 00:03:27,494
It's beautiful.

20
00:03:27,732 --> 00:03:29,165
God!

21
00:03:29,267 --> 00:03:31,758
You guys, it's
absolutely incredible.

22
00:03:31,869 --> 00:03:33,359
Incredible.

23
00:03:33,471 --> 00:03:36,372
A little paint,
you could sell this tomorrow

24
00:03:36,474 --> 00:03:37,941
and double your money.

25
00:03:38,042 --> 00:03:40,203
Carl, you're obsessed.

26
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:42,074
A little bit.

27
00:03:42,213 --> 00:03:43,339
Whoa, look!

28
00:03:46,117 --> 00:03:48,051
Hey, it's an Indian head penny.

29
00:03:48,152 --> 00:03:49,813
1898.

30
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:53,880
It's a good omen.

31
00:03:55,426 --> 00:03:56,916
You're the good omen.

32
00:04:01,099 --> 00:04:03,033
Oh, it's so great.

33
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:15,445
I had Rose
move your 3:00 to 4:00.

34
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:17,446
Gary Allen called
late yesterday.

35
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:19,015
He has to see you

36
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:21,448
about the final painting bids
for the loft.

37
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:24,020
3:00 is the only time
he can make it.

38
00:04:25,423 --> 00:04:26,754
Sam?

39
00:04:29,994 --> 00:04:31,291
Huh? Oh, I'm sorry.

40
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:34,297
Relax. This isn't brain surgery
you're going into.

41
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:37,300
Pitching these Japanese guys
makes me so nervous.

42
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:39,131
Sam

43
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:41,569
you're going to be great, OK?

44
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:44,137
What am I supposed to say?

45
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:45,402
I can't tell them

46
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:47,978
my Swedish pompom girl joke,
you know.

47
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:50,611
Those are great.
Where'd you get those?

48
00:04:50,882 --> 00:04:52,179
Nice, huh? Molly.

49
00:04:52,283 --> 00:04:54,615
What do you think? Are they me?

50
00:04:54,886 --> 00:04:56,615
Man, look at that. A Testarossa.

51
00:04:56,888 --> 00:04:57,616
Whoa.

52
00:04:57,889 --> 00:04:58,617
Ouch.

53
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:00,255
Pay off your Mustang first.

54
00:05:10,835 --> 00:05:12,166
How are you feeling?

55
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,760
What did the doctor say?

56
00:05:13,838 --> 00:05:15,772
He said it was contagious,

57
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,171
that it was really...

58
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:18,299
No.

59
00:05:18,409 --> 00:05:21,901
He said I shouldn't
be coming in today.

60
00:05:22,046 --> 00:05:23,411
What about the rash?

61
00:05:24,882 --> 00:05:25,906
The rash?

62
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:27,050
Mm-hmm.

63
00:05:27,185 --> 00:05:28,516
The rash is, um

64
00:05:28,586 --> 00:05:30,053
also incredibly contagious.

65
00:05:30,188 --> 00:05:32,088
He said they've
both been spreading.

66
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:33,350
No.

67
00:05:36,661 --> 00:05:38,822
On your genitals again?

68
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:39,963
Yeah.

69
00:05:40,098 --> 00:05:42,032
Yeah, right on the genitals.

70
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,499
Basically everywhere.

71
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:46,125
He said that I
shouldn't touch anyone.

72
00:05:47,405 --> 00:05:48,895
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

73
00:05:53,044 --> 00:05:54,044
You're sick.

74
00:05:54,078 --> 00:05:54,942
I know.

75
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:55,943
Morning, Paul.

76
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,411
Morning, Carl, Sam.

77
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:58,506
Hey, Paul.

78
00:05:58,616 --> 00:05:59,981
Morning, Mr. Wheat.

79
00:06:00,084 --> 00:06:01,428
Morning, Susan.
You're looking good.

80
00:06:01,452 --> 00:06:02,452
Sam?

81
00:06:02,587 --> 00:06:04,145
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

82
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:07,421
Here it is.

83
00:06:07,558 --> 00:06:08,558
Thanks.

84
00:06:11,062 --> 00:06:12,062
Morning, Sam.

85
00:06:12,196 --> 00:06:14,096
Morning. Listen,
the Kobiashi people...

86
00:06:14,198 --> 00:06:15,995
They're already here.

87
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,294
They're early.

88
00:06:17,402 --> 00:06:18,426
I know.

89
00:06:18,536 --> 00:06:21,437
Come here. How long
have they been here?

90
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:23,029
About 10 minutes.

91
00:06:23,107 --> 00:06:24,438
Andy Dillon called

92
00:06:24,542 --> 00:06:28,034
and says he needs $900,000
transferred to Albany by 10:00.

93
00:06:28,146 --> 00:06:29,170
By 10:00?

94
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,338
Yes.

95
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:33,474
Carl?

96
00:06:33,618 --> 00:06:34,949
Yeah?

97
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:40,179
Dillon needs 900,000
in Albany by 10:00.

98
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:43,226
Can you transfer it
to his payroll account?

99
00:06:43,294 --> 00:06:45,228
I'll need your Mac code.

100
00:06:45,296 --> 00:06:46,320
OK.

101
00:06:51,736 --> 00:06:53,226
Discretion, right?

102
00:06:53,304 --> 00:06:54,362
Got it.

103
00:06:54,472 --> 00:06:57,236
You bet. I'll do it right now.

104
00:06:57,308 --> 00:07:05,308
Bill, I'll call you back.

105
00:07:09,921 --> 00:07:11,650
OK, OK, that's fine.
That's fine.

106
00:07:11,923 --> 00:07:13,015
That's fine!

107
00:07:14,659 --> 00:07:16,593
Aw, man, it's too far out.

108
00:07:18,296 --> 00:07:20,196
Can you get this, man?

109
00:07:20,298 --> 00:07:22,198
Where are you guys from,

110
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,200
the New York City Ballet?

111
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:29,936
Almost.

112
00:07:33,177 --> 00:07:34,337
Oh!

113
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:35,946
Saved your life!

114
00:07:36,047 --> 00:07:37,047
You shit.

115
00:07:37,114 --> 00:07:38,308
You scared me to death.

116
00:07:38,449 --> 00:07:39,916
Why'd you do that?

117
00:07:40,017 --> 00:07:42,349
It's better than seeing
this gorgeous body

118
00:07:42,453 --> 00:07:43,920
splattered all over the place.

119
00:07:44,021 --> 00:07:45,215
Look out.

120
00:07:51,562 --> 00:07:53,996
Sam? Molly? You guys home?

121
00:07:54,065 --> 00:07:55,396
Did you invite Carl?

122
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,398
Slave labor.

123
00:07:56,501 --> 00:07:57,399
- Carl?
- What?

124
00:07:57,502 --> 00:07:58,400
Hurry. Help.

125
00:07:58,503 --> 00:07:59,697
Oh, my God.

126
00:07:59,971 --> 00:08:01,495
Grab the bottom.

127
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:03,096
Want this down here?

128
00:08:03,174 --> 00:08:04,937
Right here?

129
00:08:05,042 --> 00:08:06,373
Watch your toes.

130
00:08:06,477 --> 00:08:08,468
Where do you want this?

131
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:10,547
Uh, in the bedroom.

132
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:15,017
God, this place looks great.

133
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:16,119
Yeah.

134
00:08:16,254 --> 00:08:17,585
You like it, huh?

135
00:08:17,688 --> 00:08:19,588
Like is hardly the word.

136
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:22,158
I didn't know it would be
this beautiful.

137
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:23,624
Molly, what about her?

138
00:08:23,728 --> 00:08:26,629
Leave her there
until we get the rest in.

139
00:08:26,731 --> 00:08:28,198
What are these?

140
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:30,199
Oh, let me show you.

141
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:32,201
Help me lift this up.

142
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:33,201
Here?

143
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:34,202
Voila!

144
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:35,203
Wow.

145
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:36,637
What do you think?

146
00:08:36,741 --> 00:08:38,641
It's fantastic. I love it.

147
00:08:40,077 --> 00:08:42,375
Sam, what's
this chair doing here?

148
00:08:42,513 --> 00:08:44,981
What do you mean?
I love that chair.

149
00:08:45,116 --> 00:08:47,209
I know, but we discussed this...

150
00:08:47,351 --> 00:08:48,682
I've had it forever.

151
00:08:48,786 --> 00:08:51,687
When I watch TV, I sit in it.

152
00:08:51,789 --> 00:08:53,256
This chair is ugly.

153
00:08:53,357 --> 00:08:54,255
So?

154
00:08:54,358 --> 00:08:56,292
And it doesn't go with anything.

155
00:08:56,394 --> 00:08:57,725
It goes with me.

156
00:08:57,795 --> 00:08:59,228
You're right. It does.

157
00:09:01,065 --> 00:09:02,362
We'll paint it.

158
00:09:02,466 --> 00:09:03,763
We'll what?

159
00:09:13,277 --> 00:09:14,335
Are you OK?

160
00:09:15,479 --> 00:09:16,810
Mm-hmm. I'm fine.

161
00:09:20,484 --> 00:09:22,611
What's the matter?

162
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,153
Nothing.

163
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:30,127
You worried about the promotion?

164
00:09:32,463 --> 00:09:34,090
No, not really.

165
00:09:43,741 --> 00:09:44,765
Then what?

166
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,740
Is it moving in together?

167
00:09:46,811 --> 00:09:48,472
No.

168
00:09:52,617 --> 00:09:54,209
I don't know. It's

169
00:09:54,318 --> 00:09:56,115
a lot of things.

170
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:03,159
I just don't want
the bubble to burst.

171
00:10:05,429 --> 00:10:06,828
Seems like, uh

172
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:11,896
whenever anything good
in my life happens,

173
00:10:12,169 --> 00:10:15,229
I'm just afraid
I'm going to lose it.

174
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:22,170
I love you.

175
00:10:22,313 --> 00:10:24,213
I really love you.

176
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:28,878
Ditto.

177
00:10:31,989 --> 00:10:33,388
The pilot first reported trouble

178
00:10:33,524 --> 00:10:35,389
when the number two engine blew,

179
00:10:35,526 --> 00:10:38,859
the one in the tail
of the plane...

180
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:41,295
Oh, Jesus, another one?

181
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:44,791
Oh, don't watch that.

182
00:10:46,671 --> 00:10:49,162
I should cancel my L.A. trip.

183
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:52,299
These things always
happen in threes.

184
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:54,401
Sam, get serious.

185
00:10:54,545 --> 00:10:56,843
Besides, you lead
a charmed life.

186
00:10:56,981 --> 00:10:58,915
Oh, yeah? So did they.

187
00:11:00,584 --> 00:11:01,710
It's amazing.

188
00:11:01,819 --> 00:11:03,377
Just like that.

189
00:11:03,487 --> 00:11:04,681
Blackout.

190
00:11:59,477 --> 00:12:01,775
♪ Oh ♪

00:16:10,794 --> 00:16:12,125
A glitch. What's up?

251
00:16:12,229 --> 00:16:15,130
The Greenberg and White accounts...
I can't get in.

252
00:16:15,232 --> 00:16:16,563
The Mac code isn't working.

253
00:16:16,667 --> 00:16:17,861
Oh, I changed it.

254
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:18,867
Why?

255
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:21,598
Nothing. I want to
nose around a bit.

256
00:16:21,705 --> 00:16:23,036
Is something wrong?

257
00:16:24,174 --> 00:16:25,903
Can you keep a secret?

258
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:29,640
Yeah, sure.

259
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:30,906
What's up?

260
00:16:31,048 --> 00:16:33,516
There's too much money
in these accounts.

261
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:35,584
Too much money?
That's impossible.

262
00:16:41,325 --> 00:16:44,089
Sam, this is going
to take you hours.

263
00:16:44,194 --> 00:16:45,684
Let me do this.

264
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:47,127
It's already taken me hours.

265
00:16:47,197 --> 00:16:48,687
Let me figure it out.

266
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:50,130
No, that's OK.

267
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,134
It's like a vendetta now.

268
00:16:52,202 --> 00:16:54,136
Thanks, though. I appreciate it.

269
00:16:54,204 --> 00:16:55,228
OK.

270
00:16:55,339 --> 00:16:58,274
If you start to go blind,
give a shout.

271
00:16:58,342 --> 00:17:00,810
OK. Adios.

272
00:17:00,911 --> 00:17:04,142
Listen, what are you
and Moll doing tonight?

273
00:17:04,281 --> 00:17:07,182
We're going to the theater
to see Macbeth.

274
00:17:07,284 --> 00:17:09,252
She likes the guys in tights.

275
00:17:09,553 --> 00:17:10,884
You want to go?

276
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:12,012
No, thanks.

277
00:17:12,122 --> 00:17:13,749
I want a full report, though.

278
00:17:13,857 --> 00:17:14,915
Later.

279
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:16,050
Yeah.

280
00:17:21,698 --> 00:17:23,029
Well, I loved it.

281
00:17:23,133 --> 00:17:25,624
I was spellbound the whole time.

282
00:17:25,702 --> 00:17:27,033
I could tell.

283
00:17:27,137 --> 00:17:28,627
So could everyone else

284
00:17:28,705 --> 00:17:31,196
with that resonating
snore of yours.

285
00:17:36,313 --> 00:17:38,781
Did I tell you
what Melissa said?

286
00:17:38,882 --> 00:17:40,213
Yeah, about six times.

287
00:17:40,317 --> 00:17:41,784
It wasn't six times.

288
00:17:41,885 --> 00:17:44,217
Quit being so blase about this.

289
00:17:44,321 --> 00:17:45,811
This is really important.

290
00:17:45,889 --> 00:17:48,221
I'll have two pieces
in her gallery.

291
00:17:48,325 --> 00:17:52,261
The New York Times
reviews her gallery all the time.

292
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:53,852
Molly, The New York Times

293
00:17:53,931 --> 00:17:55,865
is just some
frustrated little critic

294
00:17:55,933 --> 00:17:59,198
with pimples on his ass
who flunked art school.

295
00:17:59,303 --> 00:18:00,668
Who cares what they think?

296
00:18:00,771 --> 00:18:03,103
About eight million
readers, that's who.

297
00:18:03,173 --> 00:18:07,007
Nah, they're just
reading the sports page.

298
00:18:07,111 --> 00:18:09,011
Your work is really beautiful.

299
00:18:09,146 --> 00:18:10,613
It really is.

300
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:11,738
Thanks.

301
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:14,180
It shouldn't matter
what anyone else thinks,

302
00:18:14,284 --> 00:18:15,751
just what I think.

303
00:18:20,824 --> 00:18:23,156
I want to marry you, Sam.

304
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:24,591
What?

305
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:26,958
What?

306
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,622
Yep.

307
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:30,996
I've been thinking about it.

308
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:33,559
I've been thinking
about it a lot,

309
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:36,798
and I think we
should just do it.

310
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:38,670
You're serious.

311
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:40,141
Yeah.

312
00:18:43,947 --> 00:18:45,676
What's that look for?

313
00:18:50,287 --> 00:18:53,723
You never wanted
to talk about it.

314
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:05,197
Do you love me, Sam?

315
00:19:05,302 --> 00:19:08,328
Well, what do you think?

316
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:10,368
Why don't you ever say it?

317
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:13,940
What do you mean?
I say it all the time.

318
00:19:14,044 --> 00:19:15,375
No, you say "ditto,"

319
00:19:15,646 --> 00:19:17,705
and that's not the same.

320
00:19:19,349 --> 00:19:22,250
People say I love you
all the time,

321
00:19:22,352 --> 00:19:24,786
and it doesn't mean anything.

322
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:30,291
You know, sometimes
you need to hear it.

323
00:19:31,662 --> 00:19:33,425
I need to hear it.

324
00:19:35,199 --> 00:19:36,223
Let's go.

325
00:19:44,908 --> 00:19:46,239
What should we do?

326
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,800
Let me handle it.

327
00:19:47,945 --> 00:19:49,242
What do you want?

328
00:19:49,379 --> 00:19:51,279
Your wallet... give it to me!

329
00:19:51,381 --> 00:19:54,407
Sam, just give it to him.

330
00:19:56,053 --> 00:19:59,147
OK, just take the money.
Just leave...

331
00:19:59,223 --> 00:20:00,986
No, Sam...

332
00:20:01,058 --> 00:20:02,992
You son of a bitch!

333
00:20:05,229 --> 00:20:06,992
Sam, don't!

334
00:20:08,298 --> 00:20:09,788
Somebody help us!

335
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,959
Jesus Christ, Sam!

336
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,797
Just get off him.

337
00:20:14,905 --> 00:20:16,497
Somebody!

338
00:20:16,773 --> 00:20:18,468
Somebody help us!

339
00:20:18,742 --> 00:20:20,334
Sam, just let...

340
00:20:21,545 --> 00:20:23,342
Sam, stop it.

341
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,947
Stop it, Sam!

342
00:20:45,235 --> 00:20:46,395
Molly?

343
00:20:49,072 --> 00:20:50,403
Molly, he got...

344
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,374
Sam...

345
00:21:02,853 --> 00:21:05,048
Baby, hold on.

346
00:21:05,155 --> 00:21:07,089
You're going to be OK.

347
00:21:09,259 --> 00:21:10,487
Somebody?

348
00:21:10,794 --> 00:21:12,352
Somebody?

349
00:21:12,462 --> 00:21:14,327
Somebody help us!

350
00:21:14,431 --> 00:21:15,830
Oh, Sam.

351
00:21:17,834 --> 00:21:19,165
Oh, my God.

352
00:21:19,269 --> 00:21:21,169
Oh, Sam, come on.

353
00:21:21,271 --> 00:21:22,829
Hold on, baby.

354
00:21:22,939 --> 00:21:25,237
Someone's going to come.

355
00:21:25,309 --> 00:21:27,937
You're going to be OK.

356
00:21:37,854 --> 00:21:39,446
Somebody!

357
00:21:39,523 --> 00:21:42,219
Somebody help me!

358
00:21:42,326 --> 00:21:44,317
Please, anybody!

359
00:21:44,461 --> 00:21:46,429
Help me. Please help me.

360
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:48,498
Take it easy, all right?

361
00:21:50,133 --> 00:21:51,464
We'll help you, OK?

362
00:21:51,535 --> 00:21:54,163
Molly? Molly?

363
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:55,363
Molly?

364
00:21:58,508 --> 00:21:59,532
OK.

365
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:01,072
All right. All right.

366
00:22:01,144 --> 00:22:02,338
Molly?

367
00:22:02,479 --> 00:22:03,946
What should we do?

368
00:22:04,047 --> 00:22:05,071
Aah!

369
00:22:07,417 --> 00:22:08,315
Aah!

370
00:22:08,418 --> 00:22:11,615
Aah!

371
00:22:13,256 --> 00:22:15,156
What's happening?

372
00:22:16,259 --> 00:22:17,851
What's...

373
00:22:17,994 --> 00:22:19,154
Is he breathing?

374
00:22:22,933 --> 00:22:25,128
I don't know if he's breathing.

375
00:22:26,203 --> 00:22:28,603
Don't die, Sam. Hold on.

376
00:22:28,872 --> 00:22:30,897
Hold on, baby. Hold on.

377
00:22:31,007 --> 00:22:32,338
Oh, my God.

378
00:22:49,126 --> 00:22:50,991
Come on, man.

379
00:22:51,094 --> 00:22:52,391
All right.

380
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:54,691
Here we go.

381
00:22:54,931 --> 00:22:56,523
1...

382
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,500
Come on, baby.

383
00:22:58,602 --> 00:23:01,070
Sam, don't you leave me.

384
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:02,604
Sam, hold on!

385
00:23:03,874 --> 00:23:05,068
Sam...

386
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:06,335
Oh, Sam...

387
00:23:08,578 --> 00:23:09,909
Jesus...

388
00:23:56,626 --> 00:23:59,493
Miss Jensen, if you'll just step
this way, please.

389
00:24:16,646 --> 00:24:19,240
So, what happened to you?

390
00:24:20,383 --> 00:24:21,383
What?

391
00:24:21,518 --> 00:24:23,418
You're new, huh? I could tell.

392
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,545
Are you talking to me?

393
00:24:25,655 --> 00:24:27,122
Relax. It ain't like before.

394
00:24:27,224 --> 00:24:30,159
It's a whole new ball of wax.

395
00:24:30,293 --> 00:24:32,158
Who are you?

396
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:34,162
I'm waiting for my wife.

397
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:37,165
She's in the cardiac wing.
She's fighting it.

398
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:47,538
Shot, huh?

399
00:24:47,644 --> 00:24:49,009
That'll do it every time.

400
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:51,614
Poor bastard.

401
00:24:51,748 --> 00:24:54,342
You may as well get used to it.

402
00:24:54,484 --> 00:24:56,816
You could be here
for a long while.

403
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:03,456
Come here.
I'll tell you a secret.

404
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,050
Doors ain't so bad.

405
00:25:05,161 --> 00:25:07,061
Zip, zap... they ain't nothing.

406
00:25:07,163 --> 00:25:09,063
You'll see. You'll catch on.

407
00:25:09,165 --> 00:25:11,497
This patient's fibrillating.
Let's move it.

408
00:25:11,568 --> 00:25:14,002
Give me the paddles.

409
00:25:14,104 --> 00:25:16,004
He ain't going to make it.

410
00:25:16,106 --> 00:25:18,074
I've seen it a million times.

411
00:25:18,174 --> 00:25:19,505
He's a goner.

412
00:25:19,576 --> 00:25:21,066
He's still fibrillating.

413
00:25:21,177 --> 00:25:22,201
Clear.

414
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:26,179
You see?

415
00:25:26,249 --> 00:25:27,580
Here they come.

416
00:25:31,521 --> 00:25:33,182
Lucky bastard.

417
00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:36,225
It could have been
the other ones.

418
00:25:36,293 --> 00:25:38,557
You never know.

419
00:25:58,848 --> 00:25:59,848
Who are...

420
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:07,084
No!

421
00:26:13,196 --> 00:26:14,254
Aah!

422
00:26:14,397 --> 00:26:15,728
God help me.

423
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,231
Oh, God

424
00:26:19,302 --> 00:26:20,633
help me.

425
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:29,779
"I am sunk in the abysmal swamp

426
00:26:29,846 --> 00:26:31,780
where there is no foothold.

427
00:26:31,848 --> 00:26:34,646
I have reached
the watery depths.

428
00:26:34,751 --> 00:26:37,686
The flood overwhelms me.

429
00:26:37,821 --> 00:26:41,279
"I am wearied with calling."

430
00:26:41,358 --> 00:26:44,816
As we say farewell
to our friend Sam Wheat,

431
00:26:45,128 --> 00:26:47,460
we are reminded of his kindness

432
00:26:48,932 --> 00:26:51,457
his generosity,

433
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:54,594
his buoyancy of spirit.

434
00:26:54,671 --> 00:26:56,298
All that we treasure...

435
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:58,738
Our loved ones,

436
00:26:58,842 --> 00:27:00,104
our friends,

437
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:02,201
our body,

438
00:27:02,345 --> 00:27:05,041
our mind...

439
00:27:05,181 --> 00:27:07,513
Are but on loan to us.

440
00:27:07,617 --> 00:27:10,552
We must surrender them all.

441
00:27:10,687 --> 00:27:13,622
We are all travelers
on the same road,

442
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:16,250
which leads to the same end.

443
00:27:19,829 --> 00:27:23,321
As our loved one
enters eternal life,

444
00:27:23,466 --> 00:27:26,094
let us remember
that love, too, is eternal.

445
00:27:27,837 --> 00:27:30,305
That although we will miss him,

446
00:27:30,407 --> 00:27:32,432
our love will light the void

447
00:27:32,509 --> 00:27:34,443
and dispel the darkness.

448
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:16,342
I picked up your shirts today.

449
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:19,614
I don't know why.

450
00:28:23,793 --> 00:28:27,456
Mr. Reynolds told me
to tell you hello.

451
00:28:30,467 --> 00:28:32,458
I broke into tears.

452
00:28:35,705 --> 00:28:38,606
It's like I think
about you every minute.

453
00:28:38,708 --> 00:28:41,871
It's like I can still feel you.

454
00:28:51,588 --> 00:28:53,783
I'm here, Moll.

455
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:04,265
Floyd, what's the matter, kitty?

456
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:05,732
What's the matter?

457
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:08,804
Crazy cat.

458
00:29:12,942 --> 00:29:14,637
Sam?

459
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,414
That's really stupid.

460
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:32,217
I love this picture.

461
00:29:32,328 --> 00:29:33,260
It's great.

462
00:29:33,329 --> 00:29:36,389
Office.

463
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:46,074
Let me see that.

464
00:29:46,876 --> 00:29:47,808
It's, um...

465
00:29:47,877 --> 00:29:49,367
Sam's address book.

466
00:29:49,512 --> 00:29:50,512
Right.

467
00:29:56,553 --> 00:29:57,884
Dave Brubeck. Newport, '88.

468
00:29:57,987 --> 00:29:59,477
Should I toss them?

469
00:29:59,556 --> 00:30:00,488
No.

470
00:30:00,557 --> 00:30:04,516
No? Molly, we hated
that concert.

471
00:30:04,661 --> 00:30:05,525
Hey.

472
00:30:05,662 --> 00:30:08,688
Oh. You wanted to save those?

473
00:30:08,832 --> 00:30:10,356
Rolaids?

474
00:30:10,466 --> 00:30:12,991
Molly, what are you doing?

475
00:30:20,743 --> 00:30:24,509
I just miss him, Carl.

476
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:25,979
Me, too.

477
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:29,911
Carl?

478
00:30:30,019 --> 00:30:30,917
Yeah?

479
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,510
Wait a minute. Wait.

480
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:33,520
What?

481
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:34,920
Not that one.

482
00:30:35,024 --> 00:30:36,514
Which? Oh, I'm sorry.

483
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:38,924
I didn't mean to put
that on there.

484
00:30:39,062 --> 00:30:40,552
That's OK.

485
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,996
Hey, Moll, why don't you come?

486
00:30:43,099 --> 00:30:44,589
It's like summer outside.

487
00:30:44,667 --> 00:30:47,932
No, I'm really not up for it.

488
00:30:48,037 --> 00:30:49,937
Just for a walk.

489
00:30:50,006 --> 00:30:51,496
I don't want to.

490
00:30:51,608 --> 00:30:53,667
You can't stay in all day.

491
00:30:53,776 --> 00:30:54,936
It's not healthy.

492
00:30:55,044 --> 00:30:57,035
Carl, I can't do it!

493
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:59,978
Molly, you're not
the one who died.

494
00:31:02,118 --> 00:31:04,052
I'm sorry.

495
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,587
Don't apologize.

496
00:31:05,722 --> 00:31:07,917
Shit.

497
00:31:11,628 --> 00:31:13,391
Maybe you're right.

498
00:31:13,529 --> 00:31:15,019
Maybe just a short one.

499
00:31:15,131 --> 00:31:17,099
That a girl.

500
00:31:19,435 --> 00:31:20,595
I'm sorry.

501
00:31:20,703 --> 00:31:22,864
Don't worry about it.

502
00:31:22,972 --> 00:31:24,371
Molly!

503
00:32:24,033 --> 00:32:26,558
What are you doing here?

504
00:32:26,703 --> 00:32:29,001
You bastard.

505
00:32:31,274 --> 00:32:34,209
You son of a bitch!

506
00:32:49,993 --> 00:32:52,223
What do you want?

507
00:32:53,529 --> 00:32:55,019
Molly?

508
00:32:56,199 --> 00:32:58,997
Molly, get out!

509
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:00,126
Oh, my God.

510
00:33:04,907 --> 00:33:08,172
No, Molly! Look, no, no, please!

511
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:11,511
Molly!

512
00:33:11,614 --> 00:33:12,774
Molly, he's got a gun!

513
00:33:13,916 --> 00:33:16,146
Hi, kitty. Hi.

514
00:33:16,252 --> 00:33:18,550
You hurt her...

515
00:33:43,346 --> 00:33:44,540
Aah!

516
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,874
Shit!

517
00:33:48,184 --> 00:33:50,084
Is somebody there?

518
00:33:50,186 --> 00:33:52,780
Hello?

519
00:33:54,257 --> 00:33:55,588
Hello?

520
00:35:10,333 --> 00:35:11,823
Oh, my God!

521
00:35:13,603 --> 00:35:15,332
Let go! What are you doing?

522
00:35:16,973 --> 00:35:18,167
Aah!

523
00:35:20,676 --> 00:35:22,576
Like trains?

524
00:35:32,822 --> 00:35:35,188
Stay out! This is mine!

525
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:54,166
Shit.

526
00:37:04,447 --> 00:37:06,915
It's me. I couldn't get it.

527
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:09,348
She came home.

528
00:37:09,452 --> 00:37:11,920
Give me a couple of days, man.

529
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:13,420
I'll go back.

530
00:37:13,522 --> 00:37:15,217
Relax.

531
00:37:15,324 --> 00:37:16,814
I'll get it.

532
00:37:18,261 --> 00:37:19,785
Get what?

533
00:37:22,298 --> 00:37:23,788
Who are you?

534
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:26,164
What do you want from us?

535
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:32,170
No.

536
00:37:32,275 --> 00:37:36,211
You stay away from her.

537
00:37:36,279 --> 00:37:37,746
Do you hear me?

538
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:41,008
Stay away from her!

539
00:38:04,273 --> 00:38:05,399
And

540
00:38:05,508 --> 00:38:08,238
teddy bear, teddy bear,
turn around,

541
00:38:08,377 --> 00:38:09,810
teddy bear, teddy bear,

542
00:38:09,979 --> 00:38:11,776
touch the ground.

543
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:44,306
Rosa Santiago?

544
00:38:50,486 --> 00:38:51,851
Please be seated.

545
00:39:07,603 --> 00:39:10,538
Our sister will be with us soon.

546
00:39:12,875 --> 00:39:15,400
Sister Oda Mae,

547
00:39:15,544 --> 00:39:19,503
grant us the gift of
your all-seeing presence.

548
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:22,310
Appear before us now.

549
00:39:27,957 --> 00:39:29,982
Mrs. Santiago?

550
00:39:30,192 --> 00:39:32,126
Buenos dias.

551
00:39:32,228 --> 00:39:34,526
I'm Oda Mae Brown.

552
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:37,154
I understand you wish
to contact your husband.

553
00:39:37,266 --> 00:39:38,164
Si.

554
00:39:38,267 --> 00:39:40,565
I believe
he'll be with us today.

555
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:41,931
Thank you.

556
00:39:42,037 --> 00:39:42,969
Thank you.

557
00:39:43,038 --> 00:39:45,097
But you know, Mrs. Santiago,

558
00:39:45,207 --> 00:39:48,108
there's no telling
about that other world,

559
00:39:48,244 --> 00:39:51,179
so you've got to be
a believer, Mrs. Santiago.

560
00:39:51,313 --> 00:39:52,644
Are you a believer?

561
00:39:52,915 --> 00:39:56,214
Si. Si, I believe. I believe.

562
00:39:56,318 --> 00:39:57,649
Then let us begin.

563
00:40:19,475 --> 00:40:20,635
I can't.

564
00:40:20,743 --> 00:40:23,712
I can't. It's too difficult.

565
00:40:23,979 --> 00:40:27,312
I can't make contact.
I don't feel his vi...

566
00:40:27,416 --> 00:40:28,713
No, wait!

567
00:40:28,984 --> 00:40:30,645
I'm feeling something.

568
00:40:30,753 --> 00:40:36,157
Did he know someone
by the name of Anna?

569
00:40:37,793 --> 00:40:39,385
Consuelo?

570
00:40:39,495 --> 00:40:41,554
Lucita?

571
00:40:41,664 --> 00:40:43,063
Julietta?

572
00:40:43,165 --> 00:40:44,598
Josefina? Linda?

573
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:45,631
Maria?

574
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:48,464
ISi! His mama!

575
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:50,061
She is Maria!

576
00:40:50,172 --> 00:40:54,336
Yes! Praise God, I knew
he was with his mama.

577
00:40:54,443 --> 00:40:56,104
Oh, my God.

578
00:41:00,616 --> 00:41:03,210
It's too difficult.
It's two of them.

579
00:41:03,319 --> 00:41:05,617
I'm not sure I can do that.

580
00:41:05,721 --> 00:41:07,154
It's so trying.

581
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:09,554
Oh, I pay more. How much?

582
00:41:09,658 --> 00:41:10,556
How much?

583
00:41:10,659 --> 00:41:11,557
$20.

584
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:14,561
Way to go. Milk her
for every penny.

585
00:41:30,246 --> 00:41:35,707
Huh. Yes, I... I believe
we can start again.

586
00:41:48,397 --> 00:41:50,831
- Praise the Lord.
- Praise the Lord.

587
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:54,763
- Thank you, Jesus.
- Thank you, Jesus.

588
00:42:10,219 --> 00:42:11,516
Welcome, Mrs. Santiago.

589
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:15,647
You're fortunate today.
The spirits are churning.

590
00:42:15,724 --> 00:42:16,782
My husband?

591
00:42:17,059 --> 00:42:18,219
Have mercy!

592
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:19,692
Oh, yeah? Where?

593
00:42:22,064 --> 00:42:23,656
Julio?

594
00:42:23,766 --> 00:42:25,358
Yes!

595
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:28,299
I feel his vibration.

596
00:42:28,404 --> 00:42:30,065
Ooh!

597
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:33,399
I see him!

598
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:36,376
How is he? How does he look?

599
00:42:36,478 --> 00:42:37,672
Oh, he's a handsome man.

600
00:42:39,615 --> 00:42:40,741
Handsome?

601
00:42:40,883 --> 00:42:44,284
Mrs. Santiago,
in Our Father's kingdom,

602
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:46,251
we're all handsome.

603
00:42:46,322 --> 00:42:48,813
Oh, Julio.

604
00:42:48,924 --> 00:42:50,516
Julio's coming towards us.

605
00:42:50,626 --> 00:42:53,390
I see him! He's coming!

606
00:42:53,462 --> 00:42:54,895
He's there!

607
00:42:57,533 --> 00:43:00,559
He's dressed in a black suit.

608
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:03,535
Black suit?

609
00:43:03,606 --> 00:43:07,042
It could be blue.

610
00:43:07,142 --> 00:43:09,667
What a crock of shit.

611
00:43:09,812 --> 00:43:11,245
Who is that?

612
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:13,245
Julio! Where are you?

613
00:43:13,315 --> 00:43:14,247
Julio? Julio?

614
00:43:14,316 --> 00:43:16,079
Did you hear it?

615
00:43:16,185 --> 00:43:17,675
Damn! Where are you?

616
00:43:17,786 --> 00:43:18,718
Julio?

617
00:43:18,787 --> 00:43:20,186
Who are you?

618
00:43:20,289 --> 00:43:22,189
Whoa!

619
00:43:22,291 --> 00:43:23,519
You can hear me?

620
00:43:23,626 --> 00:43:25,685
Don't you hear him?

621
00:43:25,794 --> 00:43:27,261
I don't believe this.

622
00:43:27,363 --> 00:43:29,354
Hey, you, my name's Sam Wheat.

623
00:43:29,498 --> 00:43:32,433
Can you hear me?
Sam Wheat. Say my name.

624
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:33,796
Leave me alone!

625
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:35,267
Say it! Sam Wheat!

626
00:43:35,337 --> 00:43:37,737
Talk to me, Oda Mae.
Say something!

627
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:39,239
Sam Wheat!

628
00:43:41,310 --> 00:43:43,278
Jesus.

629
00:43:43,379 --> 00:43:45,279
- Sam Wheat?
- Sam Wheat?

630
00:43:45,347 --> 00:43:46,678
I swear, no more cheating.

631
00:43:46,782 --> 00:43:48,682
I'll do anything.
I'll do penance,

632
00:43:48,784 --> 00:43:50,684
but make that guy go away!

633
00:43:50,786 --> 00:43:51,684
No way.

634
00:43:51,787 --> 00:43:52,787
Aah!

635
00:43:59,495 --> 00:44:00,757
It's OK.

636
00:44:02,498 --> 00:44:03,829
It's OK.

637
00:44:05,834 --> 00:44:07,301
All right, sister.

638
00:44:07,403 --> 00:44:08,870
Thank you.

639
00:44:09,171 --> 00:44:11,230
Yeah, you're all right.

640
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:13,274
My mother and my mother's mother

641
00:44:13,342 --> 00:44:14,673
both had the gift.

642
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:18,269
They always said I had it,
but I never did.

643
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:19,711
I never had it.

644
00:44:19,815 --> 00:44:21,715
They told me all about it.

645
00:44:21,817 --> 00:44:25,719
But now that I got it,
I don't think I want it.

646
00:44:25,821 --> 00:44:27,311
Go away. Find somebody else.

647
00:44:27,389 --> 00:44:29,914
Somebody else?
You're out of your mind.

648
00:44:30,192 --> 00:44:31,523
I'm getting there fast.

649
00:44:31,694 --> 00:44:33,924
She hit her head
harder than we think.

650
00:44:34,196 --> 00:44:37,290
She was talking to nobody
before she hit her head.

651
00:44:37,399 --> 00:44:38,730
Sister can do that.

652
00:44:38,834 --> 00:44:40,358
Where exactly are you?

653
00:44:40,502 --> 00:44:41,833
Standing right beside you.

654
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:46,899
Well, honey, we're right here.

655
00:44:47,009 --> 00:44:48,499
Are you white?

656
00:44:48,577 --> 00:44:49,577
What?

657
00:44:49,678 --> 00:44:50,542
White?

658
00:44:50,679 --> 00:44:51,976
You're white, aren't you?

659
00:44:52,281 --> 00:44:53,578
Know what I think?

660
00:44:53,682 --> 00:44:55,411
I'll call the doctor right now.

661
00:44:55,517 --> 00:44:57,815
I knew it. A white guy. Why me?

662
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:00,286
Listen, damn it.
You're going to help me.

663
00:45:00,389 --> 00:45:02,220
There's a woman
named Molly Jensen.

664
00:45:02,324 --> 00:45:03,655
She's in terrible danger.

665
00:45:03,726 --> 00:45:06,388
The man who killed me
broke into our apartment,

666
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:08,429
and he's going to go back.

667
00:45:08,530 --> 00:45:09,861
You've got to warn her.

668
00:45:09,932 --> 00:45:12,867
What makes you think
she'll listen to me?

669
00:45:12,968 --> 00:45:14,868
It's just a phone call.

670
00:45:16,739 --> 00:45:17,831
Look

671
00:45:20,242 --> 00:45:22,210
you're all I've got.

672
00:45:22,311 --> 00:45:25,337
Now, I'm not leaving
until you help me.

673
00:45:25,447 --> 00:45:28,382
I don't care how long it takes,

674
00:45:28,450 --> 00:45:30,384
'cause I can talk forever.

675
00:45:43,665 --> 00:45:44,859
Hello?

676
00:45:44,967 --> 00:45:46,901
Uh, hi. Is this Molly Jensen?

677
00:45:46,969 --> 00:45:47,901
Yes.

678
00:45:47,970 --> 00:45:49,460
My name's Oda Mae Brown.

679
00:45:49,571 --> 00:45:51,471
I'm a spiritual reader
and advisor.

680
00:45:51,573 --> 00:45:54,633
A friend of yours gave me
a message for you.

681
00:45:54,743 --> 00:45:57,234
I know this sounds crazy,
but it's not.

682
00:45:57,346 --> 00:45:59,940
You got to believe me.
Just don't be afraid.

683
00:46:00,249 --> 00:46:02,012
Who is this?

684
00:46:02,284 --> 00:46:04,946
I got a message from Sam.

685
00:46:05,053 --> 00:46:07,283
What?

686
00:46:07,389 --> 00:46:10,483
Sam Wheat? He asked me to call.

687
00:46:11,593 --> 00:46:12,924
I told you.

688
00:46:12,995 --> 00:46:13,927
Go there.

689
00:46:13,996 --> 00:46:15,930
Forget it.
I'm not going anywhere.

690
00:46:16,031 --> 00:46:18,898

00:46:58,707 --> 00:47:00,868
just don't sing anymore.

710
00:47:04,012 --> 00:47:05,445

00:47:08,016 --> 00:47:09,916

713
00:47:10,018 --> 00:47:12,452
I never come downtown.
I hate downtown.

714
00:47:12,588 --> 00:47:14,488
She's probably not even there.

715
00:47:14,590 --> 00:47:16,057

716
00:47:16,325 --> 00:47:17,325
Oh.

717
00:47:17,392 --> 00:47:18,825
Woof.

718
00:47:18,927 --> 00:47:20,918
Which building is it?

719
00:47:22,030 --> 00:47:23,520
Uh, push 3.

720
00:47:25,033 --> 00:47:26,625
See? Nobody's there.

721
00:47:26,768 --> 00:47:28,099
She's there. Just wait.

722
00:47:28,370 --> 00:47:30,668
I did everything I said I'd do.

723
00:47:30,772 --> 00:47:32,103
I pressed the button.

724
00:47:32,374 --> 00:47:33,807

Hello?

730
00:47:40,949 --> 00:47:42,382
Molly...

731
00:47:42,517 --> 00:47:43,848
Shh! She can't hear you.

732
00:47:43,952 --> 00:47:45,385
Hi, I'm Oda Mae.

733
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:48,421
I called you about
your friend Sam Wheat?

734
00:47:49,524 --> 00:47:51,389
I told you.

735
00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:00,330
Hey, Molly! Molly Jensen.

736
00:48:00,435 --> 00:48:03,302
I know you're up there.
I know you hear me.

737
00:48:03,405 --> 00:48:05,703
I'm down here.
Sam wants to talk to you.

738
00:48:05,807 --> 00:48:07,775
This is for real.

739
00:48:07,876 --> 00:48:09,776
Remember the starfish
in Montego Bay?

740
00:48:09,912 --> 00:48:13,040
How would I know that
if he wasn't here?

741
00:48:13,181 --> 00:48:15,649
Hey, Molly, I know
about the green underwear

742
00:48:15,784 --> 00:48:17,684
that you wrote your name on.

743
00:48:17,786 --> 00:48:20,880
I'd never get over that,
I tell you that.

744
00:48:20,989 --> 00:48:23,924
I know about
the picture in Reno.

745
00:48:23,992 --> 00:48:25,550
Hey, Molly!

746
00:48:25,661 --> 00:48:28,994
Ask her about the sweater
she knitted in the closet

747
00:48:29,131 --> 00:48:30,598
that's too big.

748
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:35,033
He asked me to remind you
of the sweater in the closet

749
00:48:35,137 --> 00:48:36,934
that you knitted that's too big.

750
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:39,132
Four sizes.

751
00:48:40,676 --> 00:48:43,008
Hey, you hear me talking to you?

752
00:48:43,145 --> 00:48:44,612
I hear you.

753
00:48:44,713 --> 00:48:46,408
Shut up. Nobody's
talking to you.

754
00:48:46,515 --> 00:48:47,846
Ever hear of a phone?

755
00:48:47,950 --> 00:48:49,679
Want to kiss my butt?

756
00:48:49,785 --> 00:48:52,117
I'm not staying
down here all day.

757
00:48:52,187 --> 00:48:53,119
Thank God.

758
00:48:53,188 --> 00:48:54,678
Aw, man, shut up.

759
00:48:54,790 --> 00:48:57,122
Molly! I'm going to count to 3,

760
00:48:57,192 --> 00:48:59,558
and I'm out of here.

761
00:48:59,628 --> 00:49:00,890
1, 2, 3.

762
00:49:02,898 --> 00:49:04,388
No, Oda, wait.

763
00:49:04,466 --> 00:49:05,398
No.

764
00:49:05,467 --> 00:49:06,729
It's Molly.

765
00:49:13,408 --> 00:49:14,898
Molly?

766
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:19,945
I'm Oda Mae Brown.

767
00:49:24,052 --> 00:49:25,883
I don't know you or Sam,

768
00:49:25,988 --> 00:49:28,479
but let me tell you what he did.

769
00:49:28,557 --> 00:49:30,491
He kept me up all night

770
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:32,151
singing I'm Henry
The Eighth, I Am.

771
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:35,923
That's how he got me
to go out with him.

772
00:49:36,031 --> 00:49:37,225
Look, I'm sorry.

773
00:49:37,532 --> 00:49:39,432
I just... I just don't believe

774
00:49:39,534 --> 00:49:42,628
in this life after death stuff.

775
00:49:42,704 --> 00:49:44,035
Well, tell her she's wrong.

776
00:49:44,139 --> 00:49:46,664
He says you're wrong.

777
00:49:46,742 --> 00:49:48,676
You're talking to him right now?

778
00:49:48,744 --> 00:49:51,975
He just asked me to tell you
that you're wrong.

779
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:53,547
So where is he?

780
00:49:53,682 --> 00:49:57,049
I can't see him.
I can only hear him.

781
00:49:57,152 --> 00:49:59,586
I'm right here.

782
00:49:59,721 --> 00:50:01,882
That doesn't help, Sam.

783
00:50:01,990 --> 00:50:05,016
I'm holding her hand.

784
00:50:05,093 --> 00:50:07,220
He says he's holding your hand.

785
00:50:17,272 --> 00:50:18,603
What are you doing?

786
00:50:18,874 --> 00:50:22,605
What do you think
you're doing to me?

787
00:50:22,711 --> 00:50:25,976
If you think I'm here for
my health, you're crazy.

788
00:50:26,114 --> 00:50:28,981
Sam's dead, OK? He's dead.

789
00:50:29,084 --> 00:50:30,984
Tell her I love her.

790
00:50:31,086 --> 00:50:33,020
He says he loves you.

791
00:50:34,656 --> 00:50:37,090
Sam would never say that.

792
00:50:37,192 --> 00:50:38,124
Say ditto.

793
00:50:38,193 --> 00:50:39,683
What the hell is ditto?

794
00:50:39,795 --> 00:50:40,921
Ditto!

795
00:51:10,158 --> 00:51:11,921
To tell you the truth,

796
00:51:11,993 --> 00:51:14,325
I don't know how I'm doing this.

797
00:51:14,596 --> 00:51:15,927
Confidentially,
nothing like this

798
00:51:15,997 --> 00:51:17,931
has ever happened to me before.

799
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:19,364
I mean, nothing.

800
00:51:19,634 --> 00:51:21,363
Now I can't turn it off.

801
00:51:23,738 --> 00:51:25,797
Is this him? Is this you?

802
00:51:25,907 --> 00:51:26,805
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

803
00:51:26,908 --> 00:51:28,671
Huh. Cute.

804
00:51:28,777 --> 00:51:30,301
White, but cute.

805
00:51:30,445 --> 00:51:32,879
What I don't understand is,

806
00:51:32,981 --> 00:51:34,676
why did he come back?

807
00:51:34,816 --> 00:51:36,147
I don't know.

808
00:51:36,218 --> 00:51:37,685
Why is he still here?

809
00:51:37,819 --> 00:51:39,719
He's stuck, that's what it is.

810
00:51:39,821 --> 00:51:41,152
He's in between worlds.

811
00:51:41,223 --> 00:51:42,747
You know, it happens sometimes

812
00:51:42,858 --> 00:51:45,190
that the spirit gets
yanked out so quick

813
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:46,750
that the essence still feels

814
00:51:46,862 --> 00:51:48,193
it has work to do.

815
00:51:48,263 --> 00:51:49,696
Would you stop rambling?

816
00:51:49,798 --> 00:51:51,095
I'm just answering her question.

817
00:51:51,233 --> 00:51:52,700
He's got an attitude now.

818
00:51:52,801 --> 00:51:54,792
I don't have an attitude.

819
00:51:54,936 --> 00:51:56,836
Yes, you do have an attitude.

820
00:51:56,938 --> 00:51:58,218
We're having
a little discussion.

821
00:51:58,306 --> 00:52:00,103
If you didn't have a attitude,

822
00:52:00,208 --> 00:52:01,971
you wouldn't have
raised your voice.

823
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:03,567
God damn it, Oda Mae...

824
00:52:03,712 --> 00:52:04,974
Don't you god damn me.

825
00:52:05,113 --> 00:52:07,308
Don't you take
the Lord's name in vain.

826
00:52:07,415 --> 00:52:08,780
Would you relax?

827
00:52:08,884 --> 00:52:10,784
You relax. You're the dead guy.

828
00:52:10,886 --> 00:52:12,786
Want me to help? You apologize.

829
00:52:12,888 --> 00:52:13,786
Jesus Christ!

830
00:52:13,889 --> 00:52:14,947
I'm leaving.

831
00:52:15,056 --> 00:52:17,354
Nobody talks to me like that,
you understand?

832
00:52:17,425 --> 00:52:18,915
Now, you better apologize.

833
00:52:19,027 --> 00:52:20,358
I'm sorry.

834
00:52:20,428 --> 00:52:21,360
I apologize.

835
00:52:21,429 --> 00:52:22,987
OK?

836
00:52:23,098 --> 00:52:25,862
Now, would you sit down?

837
00:52:25,967 --> 00:52:26,865
Please?

838
00:52:26,968 --> 00:52:29,095
He's apologized.

839
00:52:30,305 --> 00:52:33,240
I need you to tell
Molly what I'm saying,

840
00:52:33,308 --> 00:52:36,243
but you have to tell her
word for word.

841
00:52:36,344 --> 00:52:39,802
Yes. He wants me to tell you
what he's saying

842
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:42,041
word for word.

843
00:52:46,988 --> 00:52:48,285
Molly, you're in danger.

844
00:52:48,390 --> 00:52:51,291
You can't just
blurt it out like that.

845
00:52:51,393 --> 00:52:53,088
And quit moving around,
will you?

846
00:52:53,195 --> 00:52:54,685
You're making me dizzy.

847
00:52:54,796 --> 00:52:57,196
I'll just tell her
in my own way.

848
00:52:57,332 --> 00:53:00,824
Molly, you in danger, girl.

849
00:53:00,936 --> 00:53:02,870
What are you talking about?

850
00:53:02,938 --> 00:53:05,031
I know the man who killed me.

851
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:06,664
He knows who killed him.

852
00:53:06,775 --> 00:53:09,335
His name's Willy Lopez.
I know where he lives.

853
00:53:09,477 --> 00:53:11,377
He's a Puerto Rican,
Willy Lopez.

854
00:53:11,479 --> 00:53:12,912
He knows where he lives.

855
00:53:12,981 --> 00:53:13,913
Write it down.

856
00:53:13,982 --> 00:53:15,313
You write it down.

857
00:53:15,417 --> 00:53:16,884
I ain't no damn secretary.

858
00:53:16,985 --> 00:53:17,985
Just do it!

859
00:53:18,019 --> 00:53:19,350
Argh!

860
00:53:19,454 --> 00:53:21,888
He's so testy.

861
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:24,925
What is it you want me to write?

862
00:53:25,026 --> 00:53:27,824
It's 303 Prospect Place,
apartment 4-D.

863
00:53:27,929 --> 00:53:29,260
303 Prospect Place?

864
00:53:29,331 --> 00:53:30,331
Yeah.

865
00:53:30,365 --> 00:53:32,390
That's my neighborhood.

866
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:34,434
Molly, he's got my wallet,

867
00:53:34,502 --> 00:53:35,992
he's got my key,

868
00:53:36,104 --> 00:53:37,435
and he was in here.

869
00:53:37,505 --> 00:53:40,872
He's got his wallet
and key and was here.

870
00:53:40,976 --> 00:53:42,876
Yesterday after your
walk with Carl,

871
00:53:42,978 --> 00:53:45,310
you talked to Floyd,
took off your clothes...

872
00:53:45,413 --> 00:53:46,880
All right, all right.

873
00:53:47,015 --> 00:53:49,210
When you came in
after your walk with Carl,

874
00:53:49,317 --> 00:53:51,251
he saw everything.

875
00:53:51,353 --> 00:53:53,821
Go to the police.
It was a setup.

876
00:53:53,922 --> 00:53:55,856
I was murdered.

877
00:53:55,957 --> 00:53:58,926
He says go to the police.
He was murdered.

878
00:53:59,027 --> 00:54:00,304
There's somebody else involved...

879
00:54:00,328 --> 00:54:03,161
I don't want no more
to do with this.

880
00:54:03,265 --> 00:54:04,755
Where are you going?

881
00:54:04,866 --> 00:54:07,801
I'm leaving, I did everything
I said I'd do.

882
00:54:07,869 --> 00:54:09,928
And don't be following me.

883
00:54:10,038 --> 00:54:11,938
I'm finished. I mean it.

884
00:54:12,007 --> 00:54:14,339
Have a nice life.
Have a nice death.

885
00:54:14,442 --> 00:54:15,442
Goodbye.

886
00:54:18,146 --> 00:54:20,512
Molly, there is no one
on earth besides you

887
00:54:20,782 --> 00:54:23,910
who wants this
to be true more than me,

888
00:54:24,019 --> 00:54:26,283
but you got to be
rational about this.

889
00:54:26,388 --> 00:54:29,448
Sam is no more
in this room than...

890
00:54:29,557 --> 00:54:35,154
Look, I understand the
need to hang on to him,

891
00:54:35,263 --> 00:54:38,232
I really do, but this is absurd.

892
00:54:38,333 --> 00:54:42,326
I know this seems absurd,
but it had to be real.

893
00:54:42,437 --> 00:54:44,371
You believed some
fortune-teller from Brooklyn

894
00:54:44,439 --> 00:54:46,430
who shows up at your door?

895
00:54:46,541 --> 00:54:49,442
I watched her have
a conversation with him.

896
00:54:49,544 --> 00:54:51,808
I don't buy it, Moll,
not for a minute.

897
00:54:51,946 --> 00:54:54,107
What about the things she knew?

898
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:55,807
What things?

899
00:54:55,950 --> 00:54:59,545
The photo Sam took of me
on our trip to Reno.

900
00:54:59,821 --> 00:55:01,413
Carl, we were alone.

901
00:55:01,523 --> 00:55:04,981
And the green underwear
that I wrote my name in.

902
00:55:08,196 --> 00:55:10,756
She said Sam knew
who killed him.

903
00:55:10,899 --> 00:55:14,164
Yeah, that he was set up.

904
00:55:14,235 --> 00:55:16,203
This is getting deranged.

905
00:55:16,271 --> 00:55:17,761
We're off the deep end.

906
00:55:17,872 --> 00:55:20,033
She had a name and an address...

907
00:55:20,108 --> 00:55:21,040
Willy Lopez.

908
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:23,441
303 Prospect Place,
apartment 4-D.

909
00:55:24,979 --> 00:55:26,310
This is sick.

910
00:55:26,414 --> 00:55:27,904
Oh, Carl.

911
00:55:28,049 --> 00:55:29,983
This is really sick.

912
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:32,119
Oh, God.

913
00:55:32,187 --> 00:55:33,518
Molly, I don't understand

914
00:55:33,621 --> 00:55:35,521
how you could... you could

915
00:55:38,193 --> 00:55:40,093
swallow this crap. I mean

916
00:55:40,195 --> 00:55:42,527
this guy may not even exist.

917
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:45,565
Maybe she's just
trying to use you

918
00:55:45,667 --> 00:55:48,227
to set someone up.

919
00:55:48,370 --> 00:55:50,338
You're right.

920
00:55:50,472 --> 00:55:51,939
You're absolutely right.

921
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:54,941
That's what I got to find out.

922
00:55:55,043 --> 00:55:57,375
What do you mean, find out?

923
00:55:57,512 --> 00:56:00,572
She said Sam wants me
to go to the police.

924
00:56:00,882 --> 00:56:03,214
Sam wants you to
go to the police?

925
00:56:03,318 --> 00:56:06,082
Jesus, Moll. Are you
out of your mind?

926
00:56:06,154 --> 00:56:08,486
What are you going
to tell the police?

927
00:56:08,590 --> 00:56:10,080
That some storefront psychic

928
00:56:10,158 --> 00:56:12,490
has been communing
with the dead?

929
00:56:12,594 --> 00:56:15,085
Do you know what
that sounds like?

930
00:56:15,163 --> 00:56:17,495
You're talking ghosts here,
for Christ's sake.

931
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:20,198
I'm sorry.

932
00:56:20,301 --> 00:56:23,065
This stuff just really
gets to me,

933
00:56:23,171 --> 00:56:24,069
you know?

934
00:56:24,172 --> 00:56:26,470
It's OK if you don't believe me.

935
00:56:26,574 --> 00:56:28,064
I'm trying to, Molly.

936
00:56:31,646 --> 00:56:33,238
Look

937
00:56:33,381 --> 00:56:36,282
if it'll make you
feel any better,

938
00:56:36,384 --> 00:56:40,514
I'll go check this out, OK?

939
00:56:40,622 --> 00:56:43,523
I want you to try
and get some sleep.

940
00:56:43,625 --> 00:56:44,523
OK?

941
00:56:44,626 --> 00:56:46,491
All right.

942
00:56:47,629 --> 00:56:49,529
I'll call you in the morning.

943
00:56:49,631 --> 00:56:50,631
OK.

944
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:19,652
Be careful.

945
00:57:33,575 --> 00:57:34,473
Carl.

946
00:57:34,576 --> 00:57:37,477
What the hell
are you doing here?

947
00:57:38,780 --> 00:57:40,680
Who you been talking to, Willy?

948
00:57:40,782 --> 00:57:43,216
"Talking to"?
What the hell do you mean?

949
00:57:43,351 --> 00:57:45,546
Some woman knows
all about you, everything.

950
00:57:45,620 --> 00:57:47,554
Where's she getting it from?

951
00:57:47,622 --> 00:57:50,113
I haven't said
a word to anybody.

952
00:57:50,225 --> 00:57:52,557
She knows your name
and where you live.

953
00:57:52,627 --> 00:57:55,095
A lot of women
know where I live.

954
00:57:55,196 --> 00:57:57,096
This is not a joke.

955
00:57:57,198 --> 00:57:59,132
She knows about the murder.

956
00:57:59,234 --> 00:58:01,532
I want you to find this bitch,

957
00:58:01,636 --> 00:58:03,126
whoever she is,

958
00:58:03,238 --> 00:58:05,138
and I want you to...

959
00:58:07,075 --> 00:58:09,373
Just get rid of her, OK?

960
00:58:09,477 --> 00:58:13,971
I've got $4 million stuck
in a god damn computer.

961
00:58:14,115 --> 00:58:16,413
If I don't get those codes,

962
00:58:16,518 --> 00:58:19,419
if that money is not
transferred soon...

963
00:58:22,123 --> 00:58:23,613
I'm

964
00:58:23,725 --> 00:58:24,725
dead.

965
00:58:24,792 --> 00:58:26,282
We're both dead.

966
00:58:26,394 --> 00:58:28,658
Why not tell them
you only launder money

967
00:58:28,763 --> 00:58:30,253
the first of the month?

968
00:58:30,331 --> 00:58:32,162
What the hell is wrong with you?

969
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:34,632
Is everything a joke?

970
00:58:34,769 --> 00:58:36,430
You killed a man.

971
00:58:36,571 --> 00:58:37,681
You were supposed
to steal his wallet.

972
00:58:37,705 --> 00:58:40,139
- Was that a joke?
- I did you a favor.

973
00:58:40,241 --> 00:58:41,572
That was a freebie.

974
00:58:42,777 --> 00:58:46,008
Look, these are
drug dealers, OK?

975
00:58:46,147 --> 00:58:48,479
Just don't blow this for me.

976
00:58:48,550 --> 00:58:51,417
I've risked my job.
I could go to jail.

977
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:54,682
$80,000 of that money is mine.

978
00:58:58,059 --> 00:58:59,287
Look, just

979
00:58:59,394 --> 00:59:02,056
let me have the key
to Sam's apartment.

980
00:59:02,163 --> 00:59:04,723
I'll get the address book
myself, OK?

981
00:59:30,658 --> 00:59:33,092
You god damn bastard!

982
00:59:33,194 --> 00:59:34,194
Why?

983
00:59:34,295 --> 00:59:36,729
Why? You were my friend!

984
00:59:39,133 --> 00:59:41,499
I had a life, god damn you.

985
00:59:41,636 --> 00:59:43,297
I had a life!

986
00:59:52,347 --> 00:59:55,612
Look, I don't even believe
in this stuff myself.

987
00:59:55,717 --> 00:59:57,184
But she was real.

988
00:59:57,285 --> 01:00:00,880
You think I'd come down here
if it wasn't real?

989
01:00:02,290 --> 01:00:03,290
You know,

990
01:00:03,324 --> 01:00:06,623
you told me if I had
any new information

991
01:00:06,728 --> 01:00:08,218
that I should come.

992
01:00:08,296 --> 01:00:09,627
So here I am.

993
01:00:13,801 --> 01:00:15,735
I know how this sounds.

994
01:00:15,803 --> 01:00:17,737
I hear myself saying it,

995
01:00:17,805 --> 01:00:19,739
and I want to cringe.

996
01:00:19,807 --> 01:00:22,776
But this woman knew things
she couldn't have known.

997
01:00:22,844 --> 01:00:25,335
Things Sam only said to me.

998
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:28,472
OK, according to this
psychic lady,

999
01:00:28,616 --> 01:00:32,950
there are ghosts and spirits
all over the place

1000
01:00:33,187 --> 01:00:34,950
watching us all the time?

1001
01:00:35,189 --> 01:00:36,189
Huh?

1002
01:00:38,726 --> 01:00:41,661
Hell, I'm never going
to get undressed again.

1003
01:00:41,729 --> 01:00:42,661
Excuse me.

1004
01:00:42,730 --> 01:00:45,665
I got more
important things to do.

1005
01:00:56,577 --> 01:00:58,841
The guy's name is Willy Lopez.

1006
01:00:58,980 --> 01:01:02,313
All I'm asking you to do
is check it out.

1007
01:01:02,450 --> 01:01:03,781
OK. Wait here.

1008
01:01:03,851 --> 01:01:07,582
Let me see if the guy's
got a record, all right?

1009
01:01:07,689 --> 01:01:09,418
Great.

1010
01:02:11,919 --> 01:02:13,477
What are you doing?

1011
01:02:13,588 --> 01:02:15,613
Where's the file on Willy Lopez?

1012
01:02:15,723 --> 01:02:17,213
There isn't one.

1013
01:02:17,291 --> 01:02:19,225
He was probably
some old boyfriend

1014
01:02:19,293 --> 01:02:21,625
she was trying to get even with.

1015
01:02:21,729 --> 01:02:23,629
This psychic woman's
got a record

1016
01:02:23,731 --> 01:02:26,222
that goes back a long way.

1017
01:02:26,334 --> 01:02:27,232
1967,

1018
01:02:27,335 --> 01:02:28,825
Shreveport,

1019
01:02:28,936 --> 01:02:29,960
forgery

1020
01:02:30,271 --> 01:02:32,603
selling false I.D.

1021
01:02:32,740 --> 01:02:35,368
Served one year, 1971.

1022
01:02:35,476 --> 01:02:38,343
Baton Rouge, arrested for fraud.

1023
01:02:38,479 --> 01:02:42,540
Numbers racketeering,
served 10 months, 1974.

1024
01:02:42,650 --> 01:02:44,083
Look, this is impossible.

1025
01:02:44,318 --> 01:02:46,513
It goes on and on.

1026
01:02:46,621 --> 01:02:48,521
She knew things, private things.

1027
01:02:48,623 --> 01:02:51,023
Now, how could she
have known all that?

1028
01:02:51,125 --> 01:02:53,616
A lot of times
they read the obits.

1029
01:02:53,694 --> 01:02:56,959
She just had to see
the word "banker"... boom.

1030
01:02:57,031 --> 01:02:59,465
Hell, they even go
through your... garbage

1031
01:02:59,567 --> 01:03:01,558
to find things they can use...

1032
01:03:01,702 --> 01:03:03,033
Letters, old papers.

1033
01:03:03,271 --> 01:03:04,602
It doesn't take much.

1034
01:03:05,706 --> 01:03:06,706
No.

1035
01:03:08,810 --> 01:03:10,300
It was real.

1036
01:03:13,014 --> 01:03:15,005
She knew about a

1037
01:03:15,316 --> 01:03:16,613
a sweater I knitted.

1038
01:03:18,753 --> 01:03:20,015
And songs we sang.

1039
01:03:25,059 --> 01:03:27,323
Our trip to Montego Bay.

1040
01:03:29,831 --> 01:03:30,889
I'm sorry.

1041
01:03:31,032 --> 01:03:33,500
I know this is hard.

1042
01:03:33,601 --> 01:03:35,933
People want so much to believe.

1043
01:03:36,037 --> 01:03:36,935
They're grieving,

1044
01:03:37,038 --> 01:03:38,369
they're vulnerable,

1045
01:03:39,740 --> 01:03:41,867
and they will give anything

1046
01:03:41,976 --> 01:03:43,466
for one last moment.

1047
01:03:43,544 --> 01:03:44,875
Believe me.

1048
01:03:45,012 --> 01:03:47,810
These people know
what they're doing.

1049
01:03:47,915 --> 01:03:50,349
I know how you must feel,

1050
01:03:50,484 --> 01:03:53,385
but you know
you can press charges.

1051
01:03:57,091 --> 01:03:58,091
No.

1052
01:04:01,996 --> 01:04:02,996
Thank you.

1053
01:04:17,578 --> 01:04:19,842
Oh, God, let this be it.

1054
01:04:32,593 --> 01:04:33,593
Yes.

1055
01:04:45,806 --> 01:04:46,738
Hello.

1056
01:04:46,807 --> 01:04:48,138
Eddie? It's Carl Bruner.

1057
01:04:48,409 --> 01:04:49,137
What's up?

1058
01:04:49,410 --> 01:04:50,410
Everything's fine.

1059
01:04:50,444 --> 01:04:51,741
Just, we're all set.

1060
01:04:51,846 --> 01:04:54,713
Let me know what
you want me to do.

1061
01:04:54,815 --> 01:04:56,715
Want you to transfer the money

1062
01:04:56,817 --> 01:04:58,114
from the 12 separate accounts

1063
01:04:58,219 --> 01:05:00,139
into a single account
under the name Rita Miller.

1064
01:05:00,688 --> 01:05:02,019
OK.

1065
01:05:02,089 --> 01:05:04,023
Tomorrow at five minutes
before closing,

1066
01:05:04,091 --> 01:05:05,922
3:55 p.m.,

1067
01:05:06,027 --> 01:05:09,929
transfer the full account to
the First Island Bank of Nassau,

1068
01:05:10,031 --> 01:05:12,727
registry number 486-9580.

1069
01:05:12,867 --> 01:05:14,767
Call us when it's done.

1070
01:05:14,869 --> 01:05:16,359
OK. I've got it.

1071
01:05:16,437 --> 01:05:17,870
Just tell Mr. Balistrari

1072
01:05:18,005 --> 01:05:20,769
that there won't be
any more problems, OK?

1073
01:05:20,875 --> 01:05:22,365
Yeah. I'll do that.

1074
01:05:22,443 --> 01:05:23,443
Thank you.

1075
01:05:23,477 --> 01:05:24,774
Good work, Carl.

1076
01:06:24,271 --> 01:06:26,762
Molly, why can't you hear me?

1077
01:06:26,841 --> 01:06:28,468
I need you.

1078
01:06:40,688 --> 01:06:42,019
Who is it?

1079
01:06:42,089 --> 01:06:43,579
It's Carl, Molly.

1080
01:06:43,691 --> 01:06:44,691
No.

1081
01:06:44,759 --> 01:06:46,090
Don't open it, Molly.

1082
01:06:46,193 --> 01:06:47,683
He's a murderer.

1083
01:06:47,762 --> 01:06:48,694
Hi.

1084
01:06:48,763 --> 01:06:49,695
Hey.

1085
01:06:49,764 --> 01:06:51,095
I know it's late.

1086
01:06:51,198 --> 01:06:52,961
I'm sorry to disturb you.

1087
01:06:53,067 --> 01:06:55,627
I've been thinking
about you all day,

1088
01:06:55,736 --> 01:06:59,035
and I feel really lousy
about what happened last night.

1089
01:06:59,106 --> 01:07:00,471
This supernatural thing just...

1090
01:07:00,574 --> 01:07:02,633
Don't worry about it. It's OK.

1091
01:07:02,743 --> 01:07:03,903
No, it's not.

1092
01:07:04,011 --> 01:07:06,946
You needed me to hear you,
and I didn't.

1093
01:07:07,048 --> 01:07:09,949
I wasn't there for you,
and that was

1094
01:07:10,051 --> 01:07:11,678
that was wrong.

1095
01:07:11,786 --> 01:07:13,117
It's just, I...

1096
01:07:14,755 --> 01:07:16,086
I just...

1097
01:07:16,190 --> 01:07:19,159
I want you to know
that I'm your friend.

1098
01:07:19,226 --> 01:07:20,750
Thanks, Carl.

1099
01:07:20,861 --> 01:07:22,692
You were never our friend.

1100
01:07:22,763 --> 01:07:25,095
That really means a lot to me.

1101
01:07:25,232 --> 01:07:27,860
Me, too. I brought you
some Japanese apple pears.

1102
01:07:28,002 --> 01:07:29,492
I know you like them.

1103
01:07:31,238 --> 01:07:32,136
Thanks.

1104
01:07:32,239 --> 01:07:33,706
That's very sweet.

1105
01:07:33,808 --> 01:07:36,003
Could I come in for a second?

1106
01:07:36,110 --> 01:07:38,544
It's just been
one of those days.

1107
01:07:38,646 --> 01:07:39,806
Maybe some coffee?

1108
01:07:39,947 --> 01:07:41,141
Yeah. Come on in.

1109
01:07:41,282 --> 01:07:42,909
No, Molly.

1110
01:07:43,050 --> 01:07:44,950
You seem a little tense.

1111
01:07:45,052 --> 01:07:46,542
Are you OK?

1112
01:07:46,654 --> 01:07:47,985
No. I'm fine.

1113
01:07:48,089 --> 01:07:50,990
It's just... What can I tell you?

1114
01:07:51,092 --> 01:07:52,582
It's been tough.

1115
01:07:52,660 --> 01:07:54,890
It just still hurts so much.

1116
01:07:54,995 --> 01:07:56,292
You lying snake.

1117
01:07:56,397 --> 01:07:59,264
And on top of it,
it's stuff at work.

1118
01:07:59,533 --> 01:08:01,592
They've given me
my own accounts,

1119
01:08:01,735 --> 01:08:03,032
which is good,

1120
01:08:03,137 --> 01:08:06,629
but I just haven't really
had time to adjust,

1121
01:08:06,740 --> 01:08:08,537
kind of absorb everything.

1122
01:08:12,813 --> 01:08:14,075
It's no big deal.

1123
01:08:17,084 --> 01:08:18,084
Yeah.

1124
01:08:24,325 --> 01:08:27,294
Can I have just
a little more cream?

1125
01:08:28,362 --> 01:08:29,556
Yeah.

1126
01:08:30,965 --> 01:08:32,023
Oh, shit.

1127
01:08:32,166 --> 01:08:34,634
Jesus. I can't believe
I did that.

1128
01:08:34,735 --> 01:08:35,929
Are you all right?

1129
01:08:36,036 --> 01:08:37,970
Yeah, I'm fine.

1130
01:08:38,038 --> 01:08:38,936
Oh, God.

1131
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:41,303
Let me throw that in the washer.

1132
01:08:41,408 --> 01:08:44,206
Don't worry about it.
It's OK. It's just...

1133
01:08:44,345 --> 01:08:45,812
You want another shirt?

1134
01:08:45,913 --> 01:08:48,347
No. It'll dry.
It'll just take a minute.

1135
01:08:48,449 --> 01:08:49,916
There you go.

1136
01:08:53,154 --> 01:08:54,416
Where were you today?

1137
01:08:54,688 --> 01:08:57,714
I thought you were going
to come into the bank

1138
01:08:57,825 --> 01:08:59,156
and sign those papers?

1139
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:01,922
I was supposed to,
but I didn't have time.

1140
01:09:02,029 --> 01:09:04,998
I went to the police.

1141
01:09:11,372 --> 01:09:12,372
You did?

1142
01:09:12,673 --> 01:09:14,573
Wow. What did you tell them?

1143
01:09:14,675 --> 01:09:15,972
What did they say?

1144
01:09:16,076 --> 01:09:17,566
It was awful.

1145
01:09:18,879 --> 01:09:20,779
I felt really stupid.

1146
01:09:20,881 --> 01:09:24,180
They brought out a file
on this woman and...

1147
01:09:24,251 --> 01:09:26,185
At least 10 inches thick.

1148
01:09:27,321 --> 01:09:28,913
A ripoff artist, huh?

1149
01:09:29,023 --> 01:09:30,081
No, Molly.

1150
01:09:31,892 --> 01:09:33,792
You know, the sad thing

1151
01:09:35,429 --> 01:09:37,363
is that I believed her.

1152
01:09:37,464 --> 01:09:38,931
Molly

1153
01:09:41,001 --> 01:09:43,060
sometimes we need to believe.

1154
01:09:44,672 --> 01:09:46,003
Why? What's the point?

1155
01:09:46,073 --> 01:09:48,473
Molly, it's not easy to face
the realities of life sometimes.

1156
01:09:49,910 --> 01:09:51,969
You got to give yourself that.

1157
01:09:52,112 --> 01:09:56,811
What you've got to remember
is the love that you guys felt.

1158
01:09:56,917 --> 01:09:59,249
You got to remember
how good Sam was.

1159
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:01,811
You were everything
to him, Molly.

1160
01:10:01,922 --> 01:10:03,253
You were his life.

1161
01:10:18,038 --> 01:10:19,369
I feel so alone.

1162
01:10:28,082 --> 01:10:29,413
You're not alone.

1163
01:10:29,516 --> 01:10:30,516
OK?

1164
01:10:31,785 --> 01:10:34,185
You got your work.
You're incredibly talented.

1165
01:10:34,288 --> 01:10:35,288
You're young.

1166
01:10:35,322 --> 01:10:37,517
You're fantastically gorgeous.

1167
01:10:39,226 --> 01:10:41,558
I don't know
what's real anymore.

1168
01:10:42,830 --> 01:10:45,298
I don't know what to think.

1169
01:10:48,535 --> 01:10:50,230
Just think about Sam.

1170
01:10:52,906 --> 01:10:55,773
Think about the time
you guys had together.

1171
01:10:57,011 --> 01:10:58,842
How wonderful that was.

1172
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:01,206
Yeah.

1173
01:11:02,416 --> 01:11:05,351
Let your feelings out,
Moll. It's OK.

1174
01:11:05,486 --> 01:11:07,920
Life turns on a dime.

1175
01:11:09,423 --> 01:11:10,423
You know?

1176
01:11:12,126 --> 01:11:13,126
I mean

1177
01:11:14,261 --> 01:11:15,819
people think that

1178
01:11:15,929 --> 01:11:18,955
they're there forever, that there's
always going to be tomorrow,

1179
01:11:19,099 --> 01:11:20,396
but that's bullshit.

1180
01:11:20,534 --> 01:11:22,468
Sam taught us that.

1181
01:11:23,971 --> 01:11:26,303
You have to live for now.

1182
01:11:28,942 --> 01:11:30,068
For today.

1183
01:11:50,164 --> 01:11:51,062
I can't.

1184
01:11:51,165 --> 01:11:52,063
I'm sorry.

1185
01:11:52,166 --> 01:11:53,166
It's OK.

1186
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:55,862
I... I... I can't.
It's just too soon.

1187
01:11:55,969 --> 01:11:56,901
It's OK.

1188
01:11:56,970 --> 01:11:58,870
You've been great, Carl.

1189
01:12:01,909 --> 01:12:03,843
But I need you to leave.

1190
01:12:03,911 --> 01:12:05,208
I understand totally.

1191
01:12:05,346 --> 01:12:06,346
Please.

1192
01:12:11,952 --> 01:12:15,149
Could we just have dinner
tomorrow night? Just talk?

1193
01:12:15,255 --> 01:12:17,587
Can I interest you in that?

1194
01:12:18,959 --> 01:12:19,983
Yeah.

1195
01:12:20,094 --> 01:12:20,992
Sure.

1196
01:12:21,095 --> 01:12:22,095
Great.

1197
01:13:30,297 --> 01:13:31,297
Hey.

1198
01:13:35,936 --> 01:13:38,268
Get off my train!

1199
01:13:38,372 --> 01:13:39,270
No.

1200
01:13:39,373 --> 01:13:41,136
Get off!

1201
01:13:41,208 --> 01:13:42,232
Get off!

1202
01:13:42,342 --> 01:13:43,138
Get off!

1203
01:13:43,210 --> 01:13:44,507
Get off!

1204
01:13:44,611 --> 01:13:45,976
Get off!

1205
01:13:46,079 --> 01:13:47,205
Get out of here!

1206
01:13:47,347 --> 01:13:48,347
Get off!

1207
01:13:48,482 --> 01:13:49,380
No.

1208
01:13:49,483 --> 01:13:51,383
Show me how you do that.

1209
01:13:51,485 --> 01:13:53,715
I'm not leaving
till you teach me.

1210
01:13:53,987 --> 01:13:54,987
Get off!

1211
01:13:55,088 --> 01:13:56,112
No.

1212
01:13:56,223 --> 01:13:57,223
Get off!

1213
01:14:04,198 --> 01:14:06,632
You stubborn asshole.

1214
01:14:06,733 --> 01:14:08,223
Ha ha ha.

1215
01:14:08,335 --> 01:14:09,666
What are you doing?

1216
01:14:09,736 --> 01:14:11,670
What the hell are you doing?

1217
01:14:11,738 --> 01:14:13,228
What am I doing?

1218
01:14:13,340 --> 01:14:15,672
You're trying to move it
with your finger.

1219
01:14:15,742 --> 01:14:18,074
You can't push it. You're dead.

1220
01:14:26,587 --> 01:14:28,521
It's all in your mind.

1221
01:14:28,589 --> 01:14:32,081
The problem with you
is you still think you're real.

1222
01:14:32,192 --> 01:14:34,092
You think you're
wearing those clothes?

1223
01:14:34,194 --> 01:14:36,424
You think you're crouched
on that floor?

1224
01:14:36,530 --> 01:14:37,428
Bullshit!

1225
01:14:37,531 --> 01:14:40,022
You ain't got a body
no more, son!

1226
01:14:40,133 --> 01:14:41,464
It's all up here!

1227
01:14:41,568 --> 01:14:43,058
You want to move something,

1228
01:14:43,136 --> 01:14:45,468
you got to move it
with your mind!

1229
01:14:45,572 --> 01:14:47,062
You got to focus!

1230
01:14:47,140 --> 01:14:49,074
How? How do you focus?

1231
01:14:49,142 --> 01:14:51,542
I don't know how you focus.

1232
01:14:51,678 --> 01:14:53,168
You just focus.

1233
01:14:56,483 --> 01:14:58,246
How did you do that?

1234
01:14:58,318 --> 01:15:00,548
You got to take
all your emotions,

1235
01:15:00,621 --> 01:15:03,351
all your anger, all your love,
all your hate,

1236
01:15:03,423 --> 01:15:04,754
and push it way down

1237
01:15:05,025 --> 01:15:06,617
into the pit of your stomach

1238
01:15:06,727 --> 01:15:09,218
and let it explode
like a reactor. Pow!

1239
01:15:11,465 --> 01:15:12,465
OK.

1240
01:15:12,499 --> 01:15:13,499
OK.

1241
01:15:18,405 --> 01:15:19,997
Don't laugh.

1242
01:15:44,731 --> 01:15:46,289
Way to go, kid.

1243
01:15:46,433 --> 01:15:47,764
I did it.

1244
01:15:49,536 --> 01:15:51,060
I did it.

1245
01:15:51,204 --> 01:15:52,501
Way to go.

1246
01:15:59,513 --> 01:16:02,380
From your gut, like I told you.

1247
01:16:05,352 --> 01:16:08,287
Give it time.
What else have you got?

1248
01:16:15,796 --> 01:16:18,287
How long have you been here?

1249
01:16:20,500 --> 01:16:22,627
Since they pushed me.

1250
01:16:22,769 --> 01:16:24,259
Someone pushed you?

1251
01:16:24,371 --> 01:16:25,599
Yeah, someone pushed me.

1252
01:16:25,706 --> 01:16:27,105
Who?

1253
01:16:27,207 --> 01:16:28,504
You don't believe me?

1254
01:16:28,609 --> 01:16:31,476
You think I fell?
You think I jumped?

1255
01:16:31,578 --> 01:16:33,045
Well, fuck you!

1256
01:16:33,180 --> 01:16:34,670
It wasn't my time!

1257
01:16:34,815 --> 01:16:36,715
I wasn't supposed to go!

1258
01:16:36,817 --> 01:16:39,285
I'm not supposed to be here!

1259
01:16:41,822 --> 01:16:43,517
Oh.

1260
01:16:44,891 --> 01:16:46,085
Oh.

1261
01:16:48,428 --> 01:16:52,558
Oh, I'd give anything
for a drag.

1262
01:16:52,699 --> 01:16:54,860
Just one drag.

1263
01:16:55,168 --> 01:16:56,726
Are you all right?

1264
01:16:56,870 --> 01:16:59,498
Who are you?
Why are you hounding me?

1265
01:16:59,606 --> 01:17:01,574
Who sent you?

1266
01:17:03,644 --> 01:17:05,441
Who sent you?

1267
01:17:07,614 --> 01:17:09,138
Leave me alone.

1268
01:17:09,282 --> 01:17:10,613
Leave me alone!

1269
01:17:10,717 --> 01:17:12,844
Leave me alone!

1270
01:17:56,430 --> 01:17:57,430
Yes!

1271
01:18:12,779 --> 01:18:14,246
You need to concentrate,

1272
01:18:14,347 --> 01:18:15,678
'cause if you concentrate,

1273
01:18:15,782 --> 01:18:17,249
you'll probably rouse him.

1274
01:18:17,350 --> 01:18:18,681
What's his name again?

1275
01:18:18,785 --> 01:18:19,683
Orlando.

1276
01:18:19,786 --> 01:18:20,786
Orlando.

1277
01:18:20,887 --> 01:18:23,720
Orlando. Orlando.
Is there an Orlando here?

1278
01:18:23,824 --> 01:18:24,722
I'm here.

1279
01:18:24,825 --> 01:18:25,723
He's here.

1280
01:18:25,826 --> 01:18:27,157
Oda Mae, I...

1281
01:18:27,260 --> 01:18:28,158
Sam.

1282
01:18:28,261 --> 01:18:29,592
Excuse me. I'm Orlando.

1283
01:18:29,663 --> 01:18:31,153
The line's over there.

1284
01:18:31,264 --> 01:18:33,164
Where did these ghosts
come from?

1285
01:18:33,266 --> 01:18:34,631
You can hear them, too?

1286
01:18:34,701 --> 01:18:37,636
I hear them in the morning
and the evening.

1287
01:18:37,704 --> 01:18:39,331
They're coming into the shower.

1288
01:18:39,473 --> 01:18:42,442
Did you tell every spook
you met about me?

1289
01:18:42,542 --> 01:18:45,238
I got spooks from Jersey
coming in here.

1290
01:18:45,378 --> 01:18:47,938
There's stuff going on
you wouldn't believe.

1291
01:18:48,048 --> 01:18:49,982
It's amazing.
You're really doing it.

1292
01:18:50,250 --> 01:18:51,012
I know.

1293
01:18:51,251 --> 01:18:52,912
Can you hurry this up?

1294
01:18:53,019 --> 01:18:55,249
Oh, chill out. Chill out.

1295
01:18:55,355 --> 01:18:56,686
I need your help.

1296
01:18:56,757 --> 01:18:58,691
There's something we need to do.

1297
01:18:58,792 --> 01:19:01,158
I'm not doing anything
else with you, Sam.

1298
01:19:01,261 --> 01:19:03,161
You're holding on to a life

1299
01:19:03,263 --> 01:19:04,628
that doesn't want you anymore.

1300
01:19:04,731 --> 01:19:06,892
It doesn't want you.
Give up the ghost.

1301
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:08,934
Are you speaking to me?

1302
01:19:09,002 --> 01:19:10,936
Does it look like it?

1303
01:19:11,004 --> 01:19:13,632
You're supposed to be
concentrating, aren't you?

1304
01:19:13,774 --> 01:19:15,264
You going to try it?

1305
01:19:15,342 --> 01:19:16,536
Thank you very much.

1306
01:19:16,643 --> 01:19:18,975
Sam, are you going
to get out of here?

1307
01:19:19,246 --> 01:19:19,974
Uh-uh.

1308
01:19:20,247 --> 01:19:21,578
Fine, then stay there.

1309
01:19:21,681 --> 01:19:22,579
Excuse me.

1310
01:19:22,682 --> 01:19:23,580
Excuse me.

1311
01:19:23,683 --> 01:19:24,945
You ready now?

1312
01:19:25,051 --> 01:19:26,484
Let's do it.

1313
01:19:26,620 --> 01:19:28,952
I got to talk to you now.

1314
01:19:29,055 --> 01:19:30,522
I've got a plan.

1315
01:19:30,624 --> 01:19:34,253
All we got to do is we can...

1316
01:19:34,361 --> 01:19:35,487
Oda Mae?

1317
01:19:42,435 --> 01:19:43,697
Oda Mae.

1318
01:19:46,406 --> 01:19:47,406
Ortisha?

1319
01:19:48,775 --> 01:19:50,743
Orlando. Is that you?

1320
01:19:50,811 --> 01:19:53,780
Ortisha, where you at?
I can't hardly see.

1321
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:54,744
Here. Sh-She's here.

1322
01:19:54,848 --> 01:19:58,284
In front of you. I'm right here.

1323
01:20:01,822 --> 01:20:05,087
Damn, baby, what did
you do to your hair?

1324
01:20:07,327 --> 01:20:08,760
Orlando, you like it?

1325
01:20:08,862 --> 01:20:11,387
It's autumn sunrise.

1326
01:20:13,900 --> 01:20:17,392
Get out of me,
you son of a bitch.

1327
01:20:20,507 --> 01:20:23,101
Don't you ever do that
to me again.

1328
01:20:23,343 --> 01:20:24,469
Orlando?

1329
01:20:24,611 --> 01:20:25,942
Ugh!

1330
01:20:26,046 --> 01:20:28,514
I can barely move.

1331
01:20:28,648 --> 01:20:30,445
You should know
better than that.

1332
01:20:30,550 --> 01:20:32,575
Jumping into bodies
wipes you out.

1333
01:20:32,719 --> 01:20:33,617
Everybody out.

1334
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:35,017
What happened to Orlando?

1335
01:20:35,121 --> 01:20:37,646
Where's the insurance policy?

1336
01:20:37,757 --> 01:20:39,088
Are you deaf?

1337
01:20:39,192 --> 01:20:41,558
I said everybody out!

1338
01:20:41,661 --> 01:20:42,821
Everybody out!

1339
01:20:42,929 --> 01:20:44,419
Get out! Get out!

1340
01:20:44,531 --> 01:20:45,862
Everybody get out!

1341
01:20:57,777 --> 01:20:59,438
Get out.

1342
01:20:59,546 --> 01:21:00,808
You the fortune-teller?

1343
01:21:00,947 --> 01:21:02,414
Who are you?

1344
01:21:02,549 --> 01:21:03,846
That's an interesting question.

1345
01:21:05,051 --> 01:21:06,712
Why don't you tell me?

1346
01:21:06,820 --> 01:21:07,844
Willy.

1347
01:21:07,954 --> 01:21:09,353
Willy?

1348
01:21:09,456 --> 01:21:11,048
Prospect Place Willy?

1349
01:21:11,157 --> 01:21:13,057
Get out of here fast.

1350
01:21:24,938 --> 01:21:27,099
Oda Mae! Sister! Sister!

1351
01:21:28,842 --> 01:21:31,174
I'm all right. I'm all right.

1352
01:21:33,580 --> 01:21:35,946
We're in trouble,
so you got to help.

1353
01:21:36,049 --> 01:21:38,950
What do you mean we?
You're already dead.

1354
01:21:39,052 --> 01:21:41,452
These people
are trying to kill me.

1355
01:21:41,554 --> 01:21:42,885
And they'll be back.

1356
01:21:42,956 --> 01:21:45,891
Why don't you just find
a house to haunt?

1357
01:21:45,959 --> 01:21:48,450
Get some chains and
rattle them or something.

1358
01:21:48,561 --> 01:21:50,722
I have a plan, and it will work,

1359
01:21:50,830 --> 01:21:52,661
but get some of your fake I.D.s.

1360
01:21:52,766 --> 01:21:53,960
Forget it.

1361
01:21:54,100 --> 01:21:57,536
If you do this, they'll
never bother you again.

1362
01:22:02,542 --> 01:22:03,634
Scout's honor.

1363
01:22:04,978 --> 01:22:06,468
All right.

1364
01:22:06,613 --> 01:22:08,171
What do I have to do?

1365
01:22:08,448 --> 01:22:10,382
What exactly do I have to do?

1366
01:22:12,118 --> 01:22:14,052
You got a nice dress?

1367
01:22:16,523 --> 01:22:19,720
I don't see what's wrong
with what I'm wearing.

1368
01:22:19,793 --> 01:22:23,126
Sorry. I made a joke.
I love your shoes.

1369
01:22:23,229 --> 01:22:25,720
I don't know anything
about banking.

1370
01:22:25,799 --> 01:22:28,131
Oda Mae, would you just relax?

1371
01:22:28,268 --> 01:22:29,758
Listen, I'm nervous.

1372
01:22:29,836 --> 01:22:31,770
I'll get you through it.

1373
01:22:31,838 --> 01:22:34,204
Your fake driver's
license is great.

1374
01:22:34,474 --> 01:22:37,773
Oh, Sam. I don't think
I should do this.

1375
01:22:37,911 --> 01:22:40,846
Straight ahead.
A stairway that says new accounts.

1376
01:22:40,947 --> 01:22:42,847
I ain't giving them money.

1377
01:22:42,949 --> 01:22:44,883
Do what I say. Don't talk.

1378
01:22:45,952 --> 01:22:47,283
Tell her you're here

1379
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:50,853
to fill out a signature
card for a new account.

1380
01:22:50,957 --> 01:22:55,223
I'm here to fill out
a signature card for a new account.

1381
01:22:55,328 --> 01:22:57,228
Do you know your account number?

1382
01:22:57,330 --> 01:22:58,888
926-31043.

1383
01:22:58,999 --> 01:22:59,761
926...

1384
01:22:59,866 --> 01:23:00,866
31043.

1385
01:23:00,900 --> 01:23:02,595
31043.

1386
01:23:04,237 --> 01:23:05,135
Rita Miller.

1387
01:23:05,238 --> 01:23:06,136
Who?

1388
01:23:06,239 --> 01:23:07,137
Rita Miller.

1389
01:23:07,240 --> 01:23:08,240
Rita Miller.

1390
01:23:08,274 --> 01:23:09,764
Didn't you sign a card

1391
01:23:09,843 --> 01:23:11,140
when you opened the account?

1392
01:23:11,277 --> 01:23:13,768
Carl Bruner opened it
for you by phone

1393
01:23:13,880 --> 01:23:15,780
and asked you to come in today.

1394
01:23:15,882 --> 01:23:18,646
Carl Bruner opened it
for me by phone.

1395
01:23:18,718 --> 01:23:20,845
Now he's asked me
to come in today.

1396
01:23:22,155 --> 01:23:23,486
Is that right?

1397
01:23:23,590 --> 01:23:25,057
Yeah.

1398
01:23:25,158 --> 01:23:30,994
All right. Just sign this
card on the bottom line, please.

1399
01:23:31,097 --> 01:23:33,998
May I use your pen?
Thank you so much.

1400
01:23:39,339 --> 01:23:41,239
No, no, no! Rita Miller.

1401
01:23:41,341 --> 01:23:43,673
I'm so sorry.

1402
01:23:43,743 --> 01:23:45,108
You know, I...

1403
01:23:45,211 --> 01:23:48,044
I need another one.
I signed the wrong name.

1404
01:23:52,986 --> 01:23:56,251
Make sure it goes up to
the third floor file

1405
01:23:56,356 --> 01:23:58,847
because you have
a transaction to make.

1406
01:23:58,958 --> 01:24:01,722
Make sure this goes
to the third floor file.

1407
01:24:01,828 --> 01:24:04,194
I have a transfusion to make.

1408
01:24:04,264 --> 01:24:05,162
A what?

1409
01:24:05,265 --> 01:24:06,789
Let's go.

1410
01:24:06,900 --> 01:24:10,165
You know what I mean.
Can I keep this pen?

1411
01:24:10,270 --> 01:24:12,238
Uh... uh, yes, sure.

1412
01:24:12,539 --> 01:24:14,063
Thank you so much.

1413
01:24:15,175 --> 01:24:18,076
Bye-bye. I just love these pens.

1414
01:24:18,178 --> 01:24:21,670
What do you want to
keep the pen for?

1415
01:24:22,816 --> 01:24:24,147
Carl Bruner speaking.

1416
01:24:24,250 --> 01:24:25,717
Hi, Carl.

1417
01:24:25,819 --> 01:24:26,717
Mr. Balistrari.

1418
01:24:26,820 --> 01:24:29,755
Balistrari? Carl, it's me, John.

1419
01:24:29,823 --> 01:24:34,157
John. John, sorry, um,
what... what... what... what's up?

1420
01:24:34,260 --> 01:24:36,751
I've got the info
on the Bradley portfolio.

1421
01:24:36,830 --> 01:24:37,728
Oh, right.

1422
01:24:37,831 --> 01:24:40,163
I'll pick it up
later, all right?

1423
01:24:40,266 --> 01:24:41,961
I'll be here till 6:00.

1424
01:24:46,973 --> 01:24:50,773
I don't suppose I can
talk you into losing the hat.

1425
01:24:50,877 --> 01:24:52,208
You keep messing with me,

1426
01:24:52,345 --> 01:24:53,778
you'll be here by yourself.

1427
01:24:53,913 --> 01:24:59,195
Shh. Now tell the guard
you're here to see Lyle Ferguson.

1428
01:24:59,219 --> 01:25:02,052
Hi. I'm here to see
Lyle Ferguson, please.

1429
01:25:02,155 --> 01:25:04,089
Do you have an appointment?

1430
01:25:04,157 --> 01:25:06,091
No, I'm here for my health.

1431
01:25:06,159 --> 01:25:08,093
Tell him Rita Miller's here.

1432
01:25:08,161 --> 01:25:10,652
You... You just tell him
Rita Miller's here.

1433
01:25:10,763 --> 01:25:11,661
One moment.

1434
01:25:11,764 --> 01:25:12,662
Don't embellish.

1435
01:25:12,765 --> 01:25:14,198
Jawohl.

1436
01:25:14,300 --> 01:25:15,733
Excuse me?

1437
01:25:19,372 --> 01:25:21,863
Now, listen.
This guy Ferguson's a real jerk.

1438
01:25:21,975 --> 01:25:23,875
I've known him for five years,

1439
01:25:23,977 --> 01:25:25,877
and he still thinks my name's...

1440
01:25:26,012 --> 01:25:27,274
Why are you whispering?

1441
01:25:27,413 --> 01:25:29,574
Just be quiet and listen.

1442
01:25:29,716 --> 01:25:31,047
He's a social moron.

1443
01:25:31,151 --> 01:25:33,847
Just tell the guard
Ferguson knows you.

1444
01:25:33,953 --> 01:25:36,854
You spent time with him
and his wife Shirley

1445
01:25:36,956 --> 01:25:39,857
at the Brewsters' Christmas
party last year. Got it?

1446
01:25:39,959 --> 01:25:41,984
What is this in regards to?

1447
01:25:42,095 --> 01:25:43,995
What? He doesn't remember me?

1448
01:25:44,097 --> 01:25:45,997
Oh, we spent all that time

1449
01:25:46,099 --> 01:25:49,330
at the Brewsters' Christmas
party last year.

1450
01:25:49,469 --> 01:25:50,959
It was beautiful.

1451
01:25:51,037 --> 01:25:54,006
A big old tree and thousands
of presents everywhere.

1452
01:25:54,073 --> 01:25:55,073
It...

1453
01:25:56,943 --> 01:25:58,308
Gas.

1454
01:25:59,412 --> 01:26:02,279
I get a little gas
from time to time.

1455
01:26:02,348 --> 01:26:03,815
That's all. Gas.

1456
01:26:04,951 --> 01:26:06,248
Quit poking me!

1457
01:26:06,352 --> 01:26:07,785
Well, don't overdo it.

1458
01:26:07,921 --> 01:26:09,821
Now, listen. This'll be easy.

1459
01:26:09,923 --> 01:26:13,017
Ferguson was so drunk,
he could've had a conversation

1460
01:26:13,126 --> 01:26:15,356
with Tina Turner
and not remember.

1461
01:26:19,732 --> 01:26:21,393
I don't know, Sam.

1462
01:26:21,701 --> 01:26:22,998
Here we go.

1463
01:26:26,372 --> 01:26:27,304
Hello. Hello.

1464
01:26:27,373 --> 01:26:28,738
Uh, yes.

1465
01:26:30,343 --> 01:26:31,833
Of course, yes.

1466
01:26:31,945 --> 01:26:34,413
Well, uh, it's been
a... a long time.

1467
01:26:34,714 --> 01:26:35,408
Long time.

1468
01:26:35,715 --> 01:26:38,047
Ask how Bobby
and Snooky are doing.

1469
01:26:38,117 --> 01:26:40,051
How are Bobby and Snooky doing?

1470
01:26:40,119 --> 01:26:42,679
Fine. Fine. Thank you.

1471
01:26:42,789 --> 01:26:44,120
Thank you for asking.

1472
01:26:44,224 --> 01:26:49,059
Uh, and how is your, uh, family?

1473
01:26:49,162 --> 01:26:51,255
Oh, couldn't be better.

1474
01:26:51,364 --> 01:26:52,922
Well... wonderful.

1475
01:26:53,032 --> 01:26:54,932
Tell him you've been wondering

1476
01:26:55,034 --> 01:26:57,400
how they did on the
Gibraltar securities.

1477
01:26:57,470 --> 01:26:58,960
I was just wondering,

1478
01:26:59,072 --> 01:27:01,836
how did you do on
the Gibraltar securities?

1479
01:27:01,941 --> 01:27:03,203
The Gibraltar securities?

1480
01:27:03,309 --> 01:27:07,177
Well, it looks like we topped out
on that one, huh?

1481
01:27:07,247 --> 01:27:08,179
Sure did.

1482
01:27:08,248 --> 01:27:09,180
Sure did.

1483
01:27:09,249 --> 01:27:11,046
That was a useful tip.

1484
01:27:11,117 --> 01:27:12,277
Good old Randy.

1485
01:27:12,385 --> 01:27:15,252
Good old Randy. Got a
good old head on his shoulders.

1486
01:27:15,355 --> 01:27:16,481
Her shoulders.

1487
01:27:16,756 --> 01:27:18,087
Her shoulders.

1488
01:27:18,191 --> 01:27:19,191
Randy.

1489
01:27:19,259 --> 01:27:21,727
So, what, um

1490
01:27:21,828 --> 01:27:23,261
what brings you here today?

1491
01:27:23,363 --> 01:27:24,853
You're closing an account.

1492
01:27:24,964 --> 01:27:26,295
I'm closing an account.

1493
01:27:26,399 --> 01:27:29,095
Do you have your account number?

1494
01:27:29,235 --> 01:27:30,099
Yes?

1495
01:27:30,236 --> 01:27:31,134
Yes.

1496
01:27:31,237 --> 01:27:32,135
Yes.

1497
01:27:32,238 --> 01:27:33,136
926-31043.

1498
01:27:33,239 --> 01:27:36,003
926-31043. Is that right?

1499
01:27:36,109 --> 01:27:37,007
Yeah.

1500
01:27:37,110 --> 01:27:38,304
Good.

1501
01:27:46,452 --> 01:27:49,944
Well, Rita, it looks like
you'll be withdrawing

1502
01:27:50,023 --> 01:27:52,218
$4 million from us today.

1503
01:27:52,325 --> 01:27:53,792
$4 million!

1504
01:27:53,893 --> 01:27:55,793
Say yes. Say yes!

1505
01:27:55,862 --> 01:27:56,794
Is that correct?

1506
01:27:56,863 --> 01:27:57,795
Yes.

1507
01:27:57,864 --> 01:28:00,128
Yes. Yes, uh, yes!

1508
01:28:00,233 --> 01:28:02,030
Yes, that's correct.

1509
01:28:02,135 --> 01:28:03,727
Easy, easy.

1510
01:28:03,870 --> 01:28:08,967
Yes. Well, how
would you like that?

1511
01:28:09,075 --> 01:28:11,043
10s and 20s.

1512
01:28:11,144 --> 01:28:12,144
Pardon?

1513
01:28:12,178 --> 01:28:13,770
Tell him a cashier's check.

1514
01:28:13,913 --> 01:28:16,245
I think better
a cashier's check.

1515
01:28:16,349 --> 01:28:18,146
A cashier's check. Fine.

1516
01:28:18,251 --> 01:28:20,151
Well, of course, uh, you know,

1517
01:28:20,253 --> 01:28:22,153
we require identification
from everyone.

1518
01:28:22,255 --> 01:28:23,745
Oh, I see.

1519
01:28:23,856 --> 01:28:25,153
It's just procedural.

1520
01:28:25,258 --> 01:28:26,953
Yes. I...

1521
01:28:36,836 --> 01:28:37,564
Thank you.

1522
01:28:37,837 --> 01:28:40,305
Well, I'll, uh,
I'll be right back.

1523
01:28:42,108 --> 01:28:43,405
$4 million!

1524
01:28:43,509 --> 01:28:44,509
Shh!

1525
01:28:49,048 --> 01:28:52,381
Yeah, get me the
First Island Bank of Nassau.

1526
01:28:52,452 --> 01:28:53,885
It's on the Rolodex.

1527
01:29:03,296 --> 01:29:07,790
Well, we have some, uh,
things for you to sign here.

1528
01:29:07,867 --> 01:29:10,836
This officially
closes the account.

1529
01:29:10,903 --> 01:29:12,837
And, uh, here you are.

1530
01:29:12,905 --> 01:29:14,236
Now sign Rita Miller.

1531
01:29:14,340 --> 01:29:15,432
Mm-hmm.

1532
01:29:16,909 --> 01:29:20,345
Rita Miller. That's my name.

1533
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:24,314
My name. Rita Miller. My name.

1534
01:29:24,417 --> 01:29:26,817
That's my name.

1535
01:29:26,919 --> 01:29:27,817
Molly, hi.

1536
01:29:27,920 --> 01:29:28,818
Hi.

1537
01:29:28,921 --> 01:29:32,049
Oda Mae, I'll be right back.

1538
01:29:32,158 --> 01:29:33,420
Just anywhere?

1539
01:29:33,526 --> 01:29:34,424
Right here.

1540
01:29:34,527 --> 01:29:35,527
Right.

1541
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:41,492
Fine.

1542
01:29:41,601 --> 01:29:44,035
The, uh, check.

1543
01:29:45,438 --> 01:29:47,338
This, uh...

1544
01:29:47,440 --> 01:29:49,203
Here you are.

1545
01:29:49,275 --> 01:29:53,211
The person you need
is right down on the end.

1546
01:29:56,416 --> 01:30:00,318
Mama took the money that
she made in the oil wells,

1547
01:30:00,420 --> 01:30:02,911
and she sunk it into gas pumps.

1548
01:30:02,989 --> 01:30:04,684
You know, how they have
at the gas station?

1549
01:30:06,426 --> 01:30:07,916
It's very, very lucrative.

1550
01:30:07,994 --> 01:30:08,926
Oda Mae

1551
01:30:08,995 --> 01:30:10,326
it really adds up.

1552
01:30:10,430 --> 01:30:11,988
Say goodbye.

1553
01:30:12,098 --> 01:30:14,430
It's been a pleasure
doing business with you.

1554
01:30:14,534 --> 01:30:17,230
Now, may I keep the pen?

1555
01:30:17,336 --> 01:30:20,362
Say good night to Bobby
and Snooky for me.

1556
01:30:20,506 --> 01:30:21,404
Bye-bye.

1557
01:30:21,507 --> 01:30:23,407
Why are you rushing me?

1558
01:30:27,780 --> 01:30:29,611
What is wrong?

1559
01:30:31,083 --> 01:30:32,175
Oh.

1560
01:30:39,091 --> 01:30:40,422
Excuse me. Lyle?

1561
01:30:40,526 --> 01:30:41,993
Oh, yes. Uh...

1562
01:30:42,061 --> 01:30:42,993
Molly.

1563
01:30:43,062 --> 01:30:44,654
Molly.

1564
01:30:44,730 --> 01:30:46,994
Jensen. The woman you were
just doing business with...

1565
01:30:47,099 --> 01:30:48,031
Yeah?

1566
01:30:48,100 --> 01:30:49,431
What did she want?

1567
01:30:49,569 --> 01:30:52,037
Did it have anything
to do with Sam?

1568
01:30:52,138 --> 01:30:54,368
Sam? Why, no. No.

1569
01:30:54,440 --> 01:30:56,772
That was Oda Mae Brown, right?

1570
01:30:57,043 --> 01:30:58,772
No. Her name was Rita Miller.

1571
01:30:59,078 --> 01:31:00,568
She was closing an account.

1572
01:31:00,713 --> 01:31:02,078
Is there a problem?

1573
01:31:03,416 --> 01:31:06,908
No, I guess not. Thank you.

1574
01:31:36,449 --> 01:31:38,974
Carl, is something wrong?

1575
01:31:39,118 --> 01:31:41,416
Is somebody playing
with the computers?

1576
01:31:41,521 --> 01:31:42,419
What?

1577
01:31:42,522 --> 01:31:44,422
One of my accounts is closed.

1578
01:31:44,524 --> 01:31:46,014
Which account? What's wrong?

1579
01:31:46,125 --> 01:31:48,423
You want me to call someone?

1580
01:31:48,528 --> 01:31:50,018
No, it's OK.

1581
01:31:50,129 --> 01:31:52,097
I can do it. I got it.

1582
01:31:55,334 --> 01:31:56,631
$4 million!

1583
01:31:56,769 --> 01:31:59,738
What am I going to
do with this money?

1584
01:32:00,039 --> 01:32:01,768
I'm going to buy the block.

1585
01:32:02,041 --> 01:32:05,772
I'm going to make my sister
go to a fat farm.

1586
01:32:06,078 --> 01:32:08,410
I'm going to buy the building.

1587
01:32:08,481 --> 01:32:09,812
I've got an idea.

1588
01:32:10,082 --> 01:32:10,810
Please donate.

1589
01:32:11,083 --> 01:32:13,677
Take the check
out of your purse.

1590
01:32:13,819 --> 01:32:17,255
Right. I should put it
where nobody can get it.

1591
01:32:17,356 --> 01:32:18,687
No. No. Endorse it.

1592
01:32:18,791 --> 01:32:21,692
If I endorse it,
then if I drop it,

1593
01:32:21,794 --> 01:32:23,284
somebody will get it.

1594
01:32:23,362 --> 01:32:26,354
I never said you were
going to get the money.

1595
01:32:26,465 --> 01:32:29,263
It's blood money.
I was killed for this money.

1596
01:32:29,402 --> 01:32:30,733
Now, endorse the check.

1597
01:32:30,836 --> 01:32:33,396
What are you going
to do with it?

1598
01:32:35,107 --> 01:32:36,472
Look over there.

1599
01:32:36,542 --> 01:32:39,136
To your left.

1600
01:32:41,414 --> 01:32:44,645
You don't think
I'm giving this $4 million

1601
01:32:44,717 --> 01:32:46,651
to a bunch of nuns.

1602
01:32:46,719 --> 01:32:49,187
If you don't,
they'll track you down.

1603
01:32:49,322 --> 01:32:50,653
Get rid of it.

1604
01:32:50,723 --> 01:32:52,315
Sam, you're killing me!

1605
01:32:52,425 --> 01:32:53,756
It's $4 million!

1606
01:32:53,859 --> 01:32:55,292
You'll go to heaven.

1607
01:32:55,394 --> 01:32:57,692
I don't want to go to heaven.

1608
01:32:57,797 --> 01:33:00,095
I want to cash the check.

1609
01:33:03,235 --> 01:33:04,099
Hello.

1610
01:33:04,236 --> 01:33:05,567
You'll thank me later.

1611
01:33:05,671 --> 01:33:07,229
How are you doing?

1612
01:33:08,874 --> 01:33:10,808
Now, endorse it "Rita Miller."

1613
01:33:11,077 --> 01:33:11,805
I know.

1614
01:33:12,078 --> 01:33:14,808
Make it out
to St.Joseph's shelter.

1615
01:33:15,114 --> 01:33:17,844
I can't believe
you're making me do this.

1616
01:33:22,922 --> 01:33:24,856
Now give it to her.

1617
01:33:24,924 --> 01:33:27,415
I want to feel it one more time.

1618
01:33:27,526 --> 01:33:29,426
Give the lady the check.

1619
01:33:29,528 --> 01:33:30,528
I will!

1620
01:33:31,931 --> 01:33:33,455
Hand her the check.

1621
01:33:33,566 --> 01:33:35,591
You can do it.

1622
01:33:37,570 --> 01:33:38,867
Give her the check.

1623
01:33:39,138 --> 01:33:40,901
I will!

1624
01:33:43,743 --> 01:33:46,712
Bless you, child. Bless you.

1625
01:33:52,618 --> 01:33:54,415
Give it to her.

1626
01:33:54,487 --> 01:33:57,388
Let go. Let go!

1627
01:33:58,491 --> 01:33:59,491
Shit.

1628
01:34:03,429 --> 01:34:05,761
I'm proud of you, Oda Mae.

1629
01:34:05,865 --> 01:34:09,357
I don't care. Stay away
from me from now on.

1630
01:34:09,435 --> 01:34:12,370
What is that nun going
to do with it?

1631
01:34:12,471 --> 01:34:15,372
Leave me alone.
Never talk to me again.

1632
01:34:15,474 --> 01:34:17,408
I think you're
wonderful, Oda Mae.

1633
01:34:53,012 --> 01:34:55,879
Go ahead, search.
You'll never find it.

1634
01:34:57,550 --> 01:34:59,745
They're going to kill you, Carl.

1635
01:34:59,852 --> 01:35:01,319
You and Willy.

1636
01:35:01,454 --> 01:35:03,354
You're going to be fertilizer.

1637
01:35:03,456 --> 01:35:07,358
They're going to bury you
right next to Jimmy Hoffa.

1638
01:35:08,661 --> 01:35:09,958
Yoo-hoo!

1639
01:35:51,003 --> 01:35:53,494
Who's doing that?

1640
01:35:53,572 --> 01:35:55,039
Who's doing that?

1641
01:36:09,889 --> 01:36:10,787
Hey.

1642
01:36:10,890 --> 01:36:11,788
Hi.

1643
01:36:11,891 --> 01:36:14,359
I thought we were having dinner.

1644
01:36:14,460 --> 01:36:16,360
I know, Moll. I'm sorry.

1645
01:36:16,462 --> 01:36:17,793
I just forgot.

1646
01:36:17,897 --> 01:36:19,797
Had trouble at the bank.

1647
01:36:19,899 --> 01:36:21,799
Forgot? I wish you'd called.

1648
01:36:21,901 --> 01:36:24,495
I've been really worried.

1649
01:36:24,637 --> 01:36:27,367
Listen, Molly.
I got to ask you about something.

1650
01:36:27,506 --> 01:36:29,838
Yeah. He needs
to borrow $4 million.

1651
01:36:29,909 --> 01:36:32,844
When you said that you
thought Sam was here,

1652
01:36:32,945 --> 01:36:34,879
that he was talking to you,

1653
01:36:34,947 --> 01:36:36,881
what did he say to you?

1654
01:36:36,949 --> 01:36:39,417
What does that have to do
with anything?

1655
01:36:39,552 --> 01:36:40,917
Just listen to me.

1656
01:36:41,020 --> 01:36:45,354
This psychic lady, I want
to know what she told you.

1657
01:36:45,457 --> 01:36:46,457
Stop this.

1658
01:36:48,561 --> 01:36:51,894
It doesn't matter.
It wasn't real.

1659
01:36:51,964 --> 01:36:54,455
What the hell happened
to you tonight?

1660
01:36:54,567 --> 01:36:56,467
Does this have anything to do

1661
01:36:56,602 --> 01:36:59,503
with her being
at the bank today?

1662
01:37:02,374 --> 01:37:03,705
The bank?

1663
01:37:03,809 --> 01:37:07,575
Yeah. Ferguson said
she closed an account.

1664
01:37:07,713 --> 01:37:10,614
Her name isn't even
Oda Mae Brown.

1665
01:37:10,716 --> 01:37:12,616
It's Rita Miller or something.

1666
01:37:15,721 --> 01:37:17,985
Carl, are you all right?

1667
01:37:20,526 --> 01:37:22,551
It's just my stomach. It's

1668
01:37:22,628 --> 01:37:24,391
um...

1669
01:37:24,463 --> 01:37:26,055
Jesus.

1670
01:37:26,131 --> 01:37:30,067
Do you have any, like, some
Pepto-Bismol or something?

1671
01:37:30,336 --> 01:37:31,064
Cyanide...

1672
01:37:31,337 --> 01:37:32,668
Uh, yeah. It's upstairs.

1673
01:37:32,771 --> 01:37:34,705
Sit down. I'll get it.

1674
01:37:40,980 --> 01:37:41,878
What's wrong?

1675
01:37:41,981 --> 01:37:44,814
Does little Carl
have a tummy ache?

1676
01:37:44,917 --> 01:37:46,384
What are you doing?

1677
01:37:51,423 --> 01:37:53,755
Now do you believe in ghosts?

1678
01:37:56,562 --> 01:37:58,655
I'll set the place on fire,

1679
01:37:58,764 --> 01:37:59,958
I swear to God.

1680
01:38:07,473 --> 01:38:09,065
I'll cut her throat.

1681
01:38:09,141 --> 01:38:10,438
Carl.

1682
01:38:11,677 --> 01:38:14,976
I swear to God.
I'll cut her throat.

1683
01:38:17,950 --> 01:38:19,713
I need that money,

1684
01:38:19,818 --> 01:38:22,150
and I want it tonight at 11:00.

1685
01:38:22,388 --> 01:38:24,720
If that psychic does
not bring it here,

1686
01:38:24,823 --> 01:38:26,501
Molly is dead. OK?

1687
01:38:26,525 --> 01:38:27,014
Molly is dead. OK?

1688
01:38:27,126 --> 01:38:29,617
Carl, who are you talking to?

1689
01:38:29,695 --> 01:38:31,856
Nothing. Now, Molly,
listen to me.

1690
01:38:31,964 --> 01:38:35,559
I can't explain this now,
but there's a problem, OK?

1691
01:38:35,668 --> 01:38:36,999
Something at the bank.

1692
01:38:37,069 --> 01:38:38,559
Carl, you're scaring me.

1693
01:38:38,704 --> 01:38:40,638
I'll come back about 11:00.

1694
01:38:40,739 --> 01:38:42,070
Why? Why not now?

1695
01:38:42,174 --> 01:38:43,903
Molly, look, I'll come back.

1696
01:38:44,009 --> 01:38:45,499
Like 11:00, OK?

1697
01:38:45,577 --> 01:38:47,909
I'm sorry to do
this to you, Molly,

1698
01:38:48,047 --> 01:38:49,947
but it's important. Got to go.

1699
01:38:50,049 --> 01:38:51,141
Oda Mae!

1700
01:38:53,752 --> 01:38:54,752
Ahh!

1701
01:38:54,853 --> 01:38:56,184
I'm Arsenio Hall.

1702
01:38:56,255 --> 01:38:58,746
Don't try to adjust
your television.

1703
01:38:58,857 --> 01:39:00,381
I'm black.

1704
01:39:00,492 --> 01:39:02,824
I want to watch Love Connection.

1705
01:39:02,895 --> 01:39:04,385
I love Love Connection.

1706
01:39:04,496 --> 01:39:06,396
I love that man on there.

1707
01:39:06,498 --> 01:39:07,396
That's Arsenio.

1708
01:39:07,499 --> 01:39:08,397
So?

1709
01:39:08,500 --> 01:39:09,831
You love Love Connection,

1710
01:39:09,902 --> 01:39:11,802
send your picture in there.

1711
01:39:11,904 --> 01:39:12,802
She did.

1712
01:39:12,905 --> 01:39:14,839
They just haven't answered yet.

1713
01:39:14,907 --> 01:39:15,839
Oda Mae?

1714
01:39:15,908 --> 01:39:16,840
Sam?

1715
01:39:16,909 --> 01:39:18,536
Not again.

1716
01:39:18,677 --> 01:39:21,145
They want the check,
and they're coming for you.

1717
01:39:21,447 --> 01:39:24,746
The check you said they
would never know about?

1718
01:39:24,850 --> 01:39:26,181
Oda Mae, what's happening?

1719
01:39:26,452 --> 01:39:27,452
Sam?

1720
01:39:27,586 --> 01:39:28,883
Get out of here!

1721
01:39:28,988 --> 01:39:29,886
Now! Go!

1722
01:39:29,989 --> 01:39:33,220
Put the damn remote down.
Come on.

1723
01:39:42,468 --> 01:39:44,868
Knock on the doors.

1724
01:39:45,004 --> 01:39:46,904
Help! Help!

1725
01:39:47,006 --> 01:39:48,906
It's an emergency. Let us in.

1726
01:39:49,008 --> 01:39:50,498
Who are you kidding?

1727
01:40:00,019 --> 01:40:00,917
Open up!

1728
01:40:01,020 --> 01:40:02,453
You can't come in.

1729
01:40:02,588 --> 01:40:04,112
The cat don't like visitors.

1730
01:40:04,189 --> 01:40:06,680
She'll pee all over.

1731
01:40:15,034 --> 01:40:17,093
They're going to get us.

1732
01:40:18,971 --> 01:40:20,131
Where's Sam?

1733
01:40:20,272 --> 01:40:21,933
The bitch just left.

1734
01:40:22,041 --> 01:40:23,531
I'll check downstairs.

1735
01:40:35,587 --> 01:40:36,587
Carl?

1736
01:41:21,300 --> 01:41:22,824
Aah!

1737
01:41:26,638 --> 01:41:27,764
Willy!

1738
01:41:36,682 --> 01:41:39,845
Hey, man. You got
a serious problem, man.

1739
01:42:01,940 --> 01:42:03,874
Help me!

1740
01:42:03,976 --> 01:42:05,034
Help!

1741
01:42:13,252 --> 01:42:15,311
Willy!

1742
01:42:40,712 --> 01:42:43,408
I heard the car.
I was standing right there.

1743
01:42:43,715 --> 01:42:46,183
You could hear it across town.

1744
01:42:55,494 --> 01:42:57,086
Sure, they snuffed him.

1745
01:42:57,196 --> 01:42:59,061
Yeah, yeah.

1746
01:43:00,966 --> 01:43:03,025
That dude is dead.

1747
01:43:08,707 --> 01:43:10,402
You're dead, Willy.

1748
01:43:32,030 --> 01:43:33,725
Aah! Aah!

1749
01:43:33,832 --> 01:43:38,326
No! No! No!

1750
01:43:38,437 --> 01:43:40,371
Aah!

1751
01:43:40,505 --> 01:43:42,496
Help me!

1752
01:44:04,396 --> 01:44:06,296
Tell the driver to hurry.

1753
01:44:06,398 --> 01:44:09,299
Yo, man, you want
to step on it, please?

1754
01:44:09,401 --> 01:44:12,336
Lady, I'm driving
as fast as I can.

1755
01:44:20,112 --> 01:44:21,204
Problems?

1756
01:44:29,054 --> 01:44:30,385
Carl, is that you?

1757
01:44:30,489 --> 01:44:32,300
No. It's me, Oda Mae. Listen.

1758
01:44:32,324 --> 01:44:32,949
No. It's me, Oda Mae. Listen.

1759
01:44:33,058 --> 01:44:35,390
Molly, I know what you
think of me,

1760
01:44:35,494 --> 01:44:37,860
but you are in serious danger.

1761
01:44:37,963 --> 01:44:40,295
I got Sam here. We got to talk.

1762
01:44:40,365 --> 01:44:42,492
Get the hell out of here.

1763
01:44:42,601 --> 01:44:44,091
I'm calling the police.

1764
01:44:44,169 --> 01:44:45,568
Tell her to do it.

1765
01:44:45,837 --> 01:44:48,271
Fine. We want you
to call the police.

1766
01:44:48,407 --> 01:44:49,897
Let us in.

1767
01:44:50,008 --> 01:44:50,906
No.

1768
01:44:51,009 --> 01:44:52,408
Look, don't you get it?

1769
01:44:52,544 --> 01:44:54,978
Sam wasn't just accidentally killed.
He was murdered.

1770
01:44:55,080 --> 01:44:58,413
He found out Carl was
laundering money at the bank.

1771
01:44:58,517 --> 01:45:00,280
This guy Carl is dangerous.

1772
01:45:00,385 --> 01:45:02,285
He tried to kill me.

1773
01:45:02,387 --> 01:45:04,878
He's going to try
to kill you, too.

1774
01:45:04,990 --> 01:45:06,753
You're in deep trouble.

1775
01:45:06,825 --> 01:45:09,157
Why are you doing this to me?

1776
01:45:09,261 --> 01:45:11,752
Why are you doing this to me?

1777
01:45:11,830 --> 01:45:14,162
Why are you doing this to me?

1778
01:45:14,266 --> 01:45:16,860
I can't... I just can't...

1779
01:45:16,968 --> 01:45:18,088
Oda Mae. Oda Mae, tell her

1780
01:45:19,338 --> 01:45:23,832
tell her she's wearing the shirt
that I spilled the margarita on

1781
01:45:23,942 --> 01:45:26,843
and the earrings
I gave her for Christmas.

1782
01:45:26,978 --> 01:45:30,311
Sam says you're wearing the shirt
he spilled the margarita on

1783
01:45:30,382 --> 01:45:33,317
and the earrings he
gave you for Christmas.

1784
01:45:39,057 --> 01:45:40,388
Don't you see?

1785
01:45:40,492 --> 01:45:42,983
I'm not a fake. Not about this.

1786
01:45:47,899 --> 01:45:49,230
Give me a penny.

1787
01:45:49,334 --> 01:45:50,232
What?

1788
01:45:50,335 --> 01:45:52,963
Push a penny under the door.

1789
01:45:53,071 --> 01:45:54,971
Push a penny under the door?

1790
01:45:55,073 --> 01:45:56,073
Do it.

1791
01:46:33,645 --> 01:46:35,272
Tell her it's for luck.

1792
01:46:35,414 --> 01:46:37,314
Sam says it's for luck.

1793
01:47:12,484 --> 01:47:15,385
We're between Green
and Mercer on Prince.

1794
01:47:15,487 --> 01:47:18,388
The gray building across
from the post office.

1795
01:47:18,490 --> 01:47:19,388
Thanks, Sergeant.

1796
01:47:19,491 --> 01:47:20,958
Please hurry.

1797
01:47:21,059 --> 01:47:22,390
We'll be waiting.

1798
01:47:22,494 --> 01:47:24,962
All right. They're on their way.

1799
01:47:25,063 --> 01:47:26,063
Good.

1800
01:47:27,499 --> 01:47:29,967
So, what do we do now?

1801
01:47:30,068 --> 01:47:31,262
Just wait.

1802
01:47:41,413 --> 01:47:42,903
Is Sam here?

1803
01:47:44,716 --> 01:47:45,716
Sam?

1804
01:47:47,419 --> 01:47:48,909
I'm sitting beside her.

1805
01:47:50,989 --> 01:47:52,422
He's sitting right beside you.

1806
01:48:02,734 --> 01:48:04,634
Sam, can you feel me?

1807
01:48:06,505 --> 01:48:07,938
With all my heart.

1808
01:48:09,241 --> 01:48:11,141
Says with all his heart.

1809
01:48:23,288 --> 01:48:24,619
I'd give anything

1810
01:48:24,723 --> 01:48:27,283
if I could just
touch you once more.

1811
01:48:30,395 --> 01:48:32,727
He says he wishes
he was alive again

1812
01:48:32,998 --> 01:48:34,761
so he could touch you.

1813
01:48:38,503 --> 01:48:39,503
Me, too.

1814
01:48:56,588 --> 01:48:58,783
OK. OK. Look.

1815
01:48:59,057 --> 01:49:00,251
You can use me.

1816
01:49:01,726 --> 01:49:02,658
Use you?

1817
01:49:02,727 --> 01:49:04,524
You can use my body.

1818
01:49:04,629 --> 01:49:06,187
Use your body?

1819
01:49:06,298 --> 01:49:08,766
Just do it quick
before I change my mind.

Molly!

Molly, are you home?

1847
01:52:18,623 --> 01:52:19,623
It's Carl.

1848
01:52:19,724 --> 01:52:21,351
Molly!

1849
01:52:21,459 --> 01:52:22,653
Fire escape.

1850
01:52:30,368 --> 01:52:31,665
What's happening to me?

1851
01:52:36,074 --> 01:52:37,074
Molly?

1852
01:52:38,743 --> 01:52:39,743
Molly?

1853
01:52:48,586 --> 01:52:49,586
Molly!

1854
01:52:50,688 --> 01:52:52,019
Son of a bitch!

1855
01:53:05,403 --> 01:53:06,403
Come on.

1856
01:53:09,908 --> 01:53:11,398
Oh. Look. Look.

1857
01:53:12,744 --> 01:53:14,268
Oh. Let's go. Let's go.

1858
01:53:14,412 --> 01:53:15,412
All right.

1859
01:53:24,756 --> 01:53:25,688
Molly!

1860
01:53:25,757 --> 01:53:27,691
Just get away from us, Carl.

1861
01:53:31,496 --> 01:53:32,394
Molly!

1862
01:53:32,497 --> 01:53:33,828
You're just a liar.

1863
01:53:33,932 --> 01:53:36,332
Listen to me.
This woman's a thief.

1864
01:53:36,434 --> 01:53:37,628
She's a con artist.

1865
01:53:37,735 --> 01:53:39,362
Why are you doing this?

1866
01:53:39,437 --> 01:53:40,631
Don't listen to her.

1867
01:53:41,773 --> 01:53:42,773
Stop!

1868
01:53:42,907 --> 01:53:45,808
Just get away from us, Carl.

1869
01:53:45,910 --> 01:53:47,400
I've called the police.

1870
01:53:54,652 --> 01:53:55,846
Oh!

1871
01:53:56,988 --> 01:53:57,988
Shit.

1872
01:53:58,056 --> 01:53:59,421
Unh! Oh!

1873
01:54:00,458 --> 01:54:02,449
Why are you doing this?

1874
01:54:02,560 --> 01:54:03,891
Don't interfere! She's a thief!

1875
01:54:06,097 --> 01:54:08,327
All right. Give me the check.

1876
01:54:08,433 --> 01:54:09,331
Carl, no!

1877
01:54:09,434 --> 01:54:10,731
Out of this, Molly!

1878
01:54:17,742 --> 01:54:20,302
Keep out of this, Molly!

1879
01:54:20,478 --> 01:54:21,740
Give me the check!

1880
01:54:21,880 --> 01:54:23,347
Get off of me!

1881
01:54:27,886 --> 01:54:29,114
Where is it?

1882
01:54:29,387 --> 01:54:30,479
Where is it?

1883
01:54:30,588 --> 01:54:32,078
Where is it, god damn it?

1884
01:54:32,190 --> 01:54:33,680
I gave it away.

1885
01:54:33,791 --> 01:54:34,791
You're lying.

1886
01:54:34,859 --> 01:54:38,386
Don't... lie to me, god damn it!

1887
01:54:40,431 --> 01:54:41,431
The check.

1888
01:54:54,545 --> 01:54:55,807
Watch out, Sam!

1889
01:54:55,947 --> 01:54:58,415
I swear to God I'll kill her!

1890
01:55:03,621 --> 01:55:05,589
Now, just

1891
01:55:05,690 --> 01:55:06,622
look.

1892
01:55:06,691 --> 01:55:09,159
Just give me the check, Sam, OK?

1893
01:55:09,427 --> 01:55:11,918
I promise you I'll let her go

1894
01:55:12,030 --> 01:55:14,794
if you just give it to me. OK?

1895
01:55:16,567 --> 01:55:17,567
Sam?

1896
01:55:19,871 --> 01:55:20,871
Sam?

1897
01:56:03,514 --> 01:56:04,514
Aah!

1898
01:56:38,082 --> 01:56:39,082
Sam?

1899
01:56:41,886 --> 01:56:43,786
Oh, Carl.

1900
01:56:43,855 --> 01:56:44,855
What?

1901
01:57:09,147 --> 01:57:10,580
What?

1902
01:57:14,552 --> 01:57:15,746
Aah!

1903
01:57:17,822 --> 01:57:19,221
Ooh! Help!

1904
01:57:23,995 --> 01:57:27,897
Aah!

1905
01:57:52,390 --> 01:57:54,187
Are you two all right?

1906
01:57:58,830 --> 01:57:59,830
Sam?

1907
01:58:02,700 --> 01:58:03,700
Molly?

1908
01:58:06,270 --> 01:58:07,760
I can hear you.

1909
01:58:44,775 --> 01:58:45,935
Oh, God.

1910
01:59:33,958 --> 01:59:35,687
Sam?

1911
01:59:35,793 --> 01:59:37,727
They're waiting for you, Sam.

1912
01:59:49,173 --> 01:59:50,663
I'll miss you.

1913
01:59:52,343 --> 01:59:54,402
Your mother would be proud.

1914
01:59:54,712 --> 01:59:58,011
I'm going to miss you, too, Sam.

1915
01:59:58,115 --> 01:59:59,446
You're all right.

1916
02:00:01,385 --> 02:00:02,818
Bye, Oda Mae.

1917
02:00:04,722 --> 02:00:05,722
Bye, Sam.

1918
02:00:28,779 --> 02:00:30,076
I love you, Molly.

1919
02:00:32,783 --> 02:00:34,842
I've always loved you.

1920
02:00:41,592 --> 02:00:42,592
Ditto.

1921
02:01:03,981 --> 02:01:05,312
It's amazing, Molly.

1922
02:01:06,984 --> 02:01:08,417
The love inside

1923
02:01:08,552 --> 02:01:10,486
you take it with you.

1924
02:01:22,566 --> 02:01:23,566
See ya.

1925
02:01:31,475 --> 02:01:32,475
See ya.

1926
02:01:51,896 --> 02:01:53,090
Bye.
