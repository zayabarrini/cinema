4
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:22,583
I’ve been sending
him photos.

5
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:25,291
Jason is very happy
with your work.

6
00:01:25,333 --> 00:01:27,666
But he feels you’re quite slow.

7
00:01:28,708 --> 00:01:31,541
Good work takes time. Right?

8
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:33,583
I’ll talk to Jason.

9
00:01:33,666 --> 00:01:37,125
You can move in by Christmas.
No stress.

10
00:01:37,416 --> 00:01:40,875
- The plastering will start right away.
- It must.

11
00:01:40,958 --> 00:01:44,250
He plans to stay here
during the holidays.

12
00:01:44,958 --> 00:01:47,333
Of course. It’ll be done by then.

13
00:01:47,416 --> 00:01:48,625
What’s the character’s name?

14
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Padmini.

15
00:01:50,541 --> 00:01:53,875
- Late as usual!
- You’re late too.

16
00:01:54,458 --> 00:01:55,625
Hurry, get in.

17
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:05,708
Hurry up!

18
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:06,916
Hurry up! Get down quickly.

19
00:02:10,416 --> 00:02:11,916
Mind your step.

20
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:16,041
Cijin, careful with those masks.

21
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:18,791
- Isn’t this beautiful?
- When did you take it?

22
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:21,041
Don’t leave anything
behind in the van.

23
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,500
Got everything, Aji?

24
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:43,125
'THE PLAY'

25
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:50,416
Finally! I thought you’d
end up serving me on stage.

26
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:53,541
Anjali, does this look good?

27
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:55,291
Yes! It’s good!

28
00:02:58,333 --> 00:02:59,958
I’ve stuck it together,
Don’t put it on now. Let it dry.

29
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,250
Don’t wear it. Let it dry.

30
00:03:02,541 --> 00:03:04,416
- I’m going.
- Where to?

31
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:06,083
I haven’t got my flowers yet.

32
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:08,125
Keep me company.

33
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:10,958
You want me to get
an earful from sir?

34
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:21,166
He’s a young boy.

35
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:22,333
That was not nice.

36
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:26,541
I’ve seen crooks much younger
than him. You have no idea.

37
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:36,291
So, you're going to
tell her today?

38
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:38,208
It's been a bad day.

39
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,875
- But I should tell her, right?
- You must!

40
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:43,541
Debts can wait,
but never love.

41
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:45,083
Tell her! She’ll say yes.

42
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,208
I’m bored of the same
damn veg food.

43
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:48,958
Madan, put in a word for me.

44
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,083
Yeah! I read it fully.

45
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:52,000
How about an omelette with it?

46
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:53,791
Bro, I’ll call tomorrow

47
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:55,875
Let’s meet in person. Okay?

48
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:57,291
You’re finally here.

49
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:59,708
You’ll be fine in five minutes.

50
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:02,875
Vinay!

51
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,541
Do I get an interview?

52
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:07,291
- No idea.
- I wanted to say something.

53
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:10,416
Prasanth, you made me panic!

54
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:12,625
I stressed you out, right?

55
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:14,458
Don’t linger on! Go
put on your make-up!

56
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:18,500
I’m glad you didn’t forget it.
Here.

57
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Keep this!

58
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:24,375
This is all my stuff. Not yours.

59
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:26,208
Your stuff is over there.

60
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:31,166
I don't take milk tea.
Any black tea?

61
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:33,375
Whose phone is it?
I’m charging mine.

62
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:34,541
That’s mine. Don’t unplug it.

63
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:37,041
- My phone has died.
- Mine’s got just 20% battery.

64
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:38,666
My phone's dead.

65
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:40,541
Thank you.

66
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:45,000
Jolly, buy a mosquito repellent.
Didn’t you all get bitten last night?

67
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:46,583
- What’s your name?
- Manikandan.

68
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:48,291
Hey, I wasn't bitten.

69
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:52,125
Non-vegetarians have
a higher body heat.

70
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,958
That attracts mosquitoes.

71
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:57,000
What’s wrong?
Why are you so serious?

72
00:04:57,791 --> 00:04:58,791
It's nothing.

73
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:03,208
- Nervous about the performance?
- No.

74
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:07,291
Why is there only
one lady in this play?

75
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:09,666
- This play is like that…
- Sir…

76
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:10,875
Is it about to start?

77
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:12,583
No, no. Carry on.

78
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:14,916
See...

79
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:16,875
Cijin might pull some stunt.

80
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:20,125
- To check the girl out.
- Let him try.

81
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:24,208
Look at the camera. Smile.

82
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:25,916
- All good?
- Yeah.

83
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:27,375
Ready?

84
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:29,541
It’s not fair to click a
selfie without the hero.

85
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:30,833
Come!

86
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:33,166
He's only interested in
being photographed.

87
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,000
Move.

88
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:38,708
I came to get you.
Sir is looking for you.

89
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:41,041
- Why?
- What's the matter?

90
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:43,625
- I don’t know.
- He seems really upset.

91
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,666
I’ve been longing to take
a picture with Selvan.

92
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:47,750
Come on.

93
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,625
Say cheese, everyone.

94
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:52,208
Hari, you’re blocking the others.

95
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:55,166
Really? That’s because you’re
short. Move to the back.

96
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:58,083
Give it to me. Once more.
Now everyone, smile.

97
00:05:58,583 --> 00:05:59,916
Look here and smile.

98
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:02,250
I can’t fit everyone
in the frame.

99
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:04,750
It doesn't have a wide angle!
Whose bloody phone is this?

100
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:06,958
You’ve got a terrible phone.

101
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:09,791
Let me try mine.

102
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:11,375
See? Look here.
Now look!

103
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:13,250
See the difference?

104
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:14,583
Can someone click it
for god-sake?

105
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:18,875
Shorties come forward.
Aji and Anjali, come to the front.

106
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,791
Vinay. You, too.

107
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:23,750
Just take the picture.
Don’t get on my nerves!

108
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:24,833
Click the photo.

109
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:29,333
Such unnecessary
inferior feelings.

110
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:32,541
- To hell with the photo.
- Everybody, smile!

111
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,291
You can only
expand on the possibilities...

112
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:39,958
and the suggestive structures
the playwright allows you to.

113
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:41,583
- Sir.
- Yes, Cijin?

114
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:42,750
Hari said you called me.

115
00:06:42,791 --> 00:06:45,791
It’s fun when young
boys play such tricks.

116
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:47,958
But you’re a father to
a three-year-old.

117
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:49,083
Goodness!

118
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:51,083
You’ve seen the girl, right?
Now, go.

119
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:53,958
- Hari said you called me.
- Go!

120
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:03,291
Don’t you dare do
such pranks again!

121
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:05,125
Who the fuck are you!

122
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,500
Are you threatening me?

123
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:14,041
Did I startle you? Did I?

124
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:16,458
Come on, you are a man!

125
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:18,250
Don’t get scared so easily.

126
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:20,375
- What's going on?
- Nothing, Aji.

127
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:21,916
- We’re having fun.
- Leave him alone.

128
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:23,625
Just fun. What a shame.

129
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:27,000
Slowly turn around. Lower
your head and bend backwards.

130
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,625
Stretch again…
to the other side.

131
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:34,666
And when we slowly
come closer to this position,

132
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:36,875
Our shadows will look like
we’re kissing.

133
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:38,000
Right?

134
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:44,833
I have nothing new to say.

135
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:48,416
For the next hour and a half...

136
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:51,125
Keep your minds focused
on your characters...

137
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:52,708
onstage and offstage.

138
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:55,916
Don't be complacent, thinking you've
played the role over forty times.

139
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:58,291
Jolly, mind your neck.

140
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,208
Don’t roll it too much.

141
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:02,750
Keep in mind that we soon
have to perform in Delhi.

142
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:04,041
That’s all.

143
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:05,791
Do your best. It’ll turn out well.

144
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:08,333
- Sir, I want to say something.
- Please.

145
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:12,083
A few of my filmmaker
friends have agreed to come.

146
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:14,875
I’m not sure they will. But
I’ve asked them to come.

147
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,875
And there are some
foreigners as well.

148
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:19,541
So, If you...

149
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:20,875
I mean, if we...

150
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:24,916
perform well, many of us
will benefit. Got it?

151
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:27,416
As sir said, let's do it well.
All the best!

152
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:28,458
All the best

153
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:48,041
Kapilan!

154
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:49,833
I’m not Kapilan!

155
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,750
I’m Devadathan!

156
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:55,125
You can’t be Devadathan!

157
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,208
Your words are unpleasant

158
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:00,083
And your body
lacks that fragrance

159
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:02,583
♪ I resist! ♪

160
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:05,083
♪ I resist your fragrance
and your bond. ♪

161
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:07,708
♪ Go away! ♪

162
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:09,708

163
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:11,083
Merciless!

164
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:13,958
Did I not marry you?

165
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:17,833
Is your womb not bearing
my child?

166
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:19,833
♪ Have mercy on me. ♪

167
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:23,458
♪ I’m your consort. ♪

168

Liar!

169
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:28,333
I won’t be carried away
by your demonic ways.

170
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:29,708
I belong to him!

171
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:33,875
To the valiant and majestic,

172
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:35,708
Devadathan!

173
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:38,375

181
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:47,000
I have endured decades of penance

182
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:49,333
Acquired wisdom from
all the Vedas

183
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:56,041
I have mastered
and embodied all arts

184
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:59,500
But Kapilan! You can never
be as great as Devadathan

185
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:00,625
Why not?

186
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:05,041
Your ego is louder
than your hymns

187
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:07,125
Sever it!

188
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:18,791
Sever everything that
smells of the ego.

189
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,166
- What’s the matter?
- I'll tell you.

190
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,041
He has our photos from the play.

191
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,916
But he’ll only share them
if we pay him.

192
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:00,583
So we’re paying him handsomely!

193
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:04,041
- Go on.
- 181613

194
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:07,541
Got it?

195
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:11,125
Still holding onto her photo?
Beware of Nandan.

196
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:12,958
Give me the damn phone!

197
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:15,875
Done? Okay! See you.

198
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:17,875
We watch all your
movies. You are awesome!

199
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:20,250
- She’s your biggest fan!
- Thank you so much.

200
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:22,333
Please stop playing the villain
and play the hero instead.

201
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:24,500
Yea, they are coming soon!

202
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:27,333
Hope you liked
the play. Thank you!

203
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:35,333
The director is here.

204
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:40,250
- Is everyone here?
- Yes, Sir.

205
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:42,583
They are Hari’s friends.

206
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:44,583
Chris Trevor...

207
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:45,791
and his wife Emily.

208
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Hello.

209
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:49,500
They wanted to congratulate
you in person.

210
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:52,125
You can tell them. Please.

211
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:57,500
I’ve seen a few plays here in
India but this one really stands out.

212
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,250
Very rooted and yet
very contemporary.

213
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:04,166
I mean, it’s such a spectacle.

214
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:07,625
You know... the
lights, the music.

215
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:11,041
This man, what a director!

216
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:12,958
What a Director!

217
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:15,791
- Selvan, did you understand?
- What was that end bit?

218
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:17,791
As if you got any of it!

219
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:20,958
He said the play was wonderful.
Say thanks. Relax!

220
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:22,333
Thank you, Sir.

221
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:25,666
So, where’s the
lady of the play?

222
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:27,291
Anjali!

223
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:28,333
Hi!

224
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:33,333
You know... I think I have a
bias to the lady of the play.

225
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:38,541
I think she outdid
all of you men.

226
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:42,125
Were you dancing
or flying, darling?

227
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:43,750
Sorry?

228
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:46,250
Were you dancing or flying?

229
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:51,500
She’s saying we men
weren’t as good as Anjali.

230
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:53,958
Come on, Madan!

231
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:57,500
Anjali has been in this
group from a very young age.

232
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:59,541
Sixteen or seventeen?

233
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:02,208
- Sixteen.
- Sixteen? Wow! Very nice!

234
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:05,041
- Vinay also.
- We… We both came together.

235
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:07,041
- We were in school.
- Okay…

236
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,708
- Hari.
- Yeah?

237
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:11,500
Should you tell them about
the dinner... Or should I?

238
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,708
Yeah, I will.

239
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:16,750
They have a
property in Fort Kochi.

240
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,250
Great ambience!

241
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:21,583
So they are here to invite all
of us to spend the night there.

242
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:23,958
They plan to throw us a party.

243
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:25,625
That sounds great!

244
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:28,625
They don’t have any guests
tonight. It’s fully vacant.

245
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:31,666
So we'll all sleep there
and part in the morning.

246
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:33,750
You are a sweetheart Hari!

247
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:35,750
Let’s have a ball tonight!

248
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:38,291
Awesome!
Great!

249
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:44,458
Anjali!

250
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:47,208
You frightened me, Prasant!

251
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:48,875
- Congrats!
- For what?

252
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:51,291
Everyone is talking
about your performance.

253
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:51,791
Oh.

254
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:53,166
You were fantastic!

255
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:56,208
I feel good about it too.

256
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:58,250
Everything somehow
fell into place, right?

257
00:14:58,458 --> 00:14:59,458
True.

258
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:02,583
Are you free?

259
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,416
I have something to tell you.
Just two minutes.

260
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:08,583
Ah, I am free...

261
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:12,125
But I must return Shajitha
her clothes right away.

262
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:13,791
No problem.

263
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:15,583
- We’ll talk later?
- It’s okay.

264
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:16,708
Okay.

265
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:20,875
It’s fine. We’ll take an Uber.

266
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:25,041
- It’s too late.
- 7.45 is not too late.

267
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:28,000
Invites like these don’t come often.

268
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:30,291
Don’t be a spoilsport.
Go with them.

269
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:33,083
Oh no! You guys are stinking.

270
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,458
Spray it on!

271
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:38,125
Let me spray him first.
He’s too smelly.

272
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:39,666
Your perfume gives me an itch.

273
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:41,291
That's enough!

274
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:43,458
Prashanth! Come here.

275
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:45,875
Doesn’t this belong to Hari?

276
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:47,541
So what? It's mine now.

277
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:53,000
Jolly. Three bottles of booze?
Aren’t you tempted?

278
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,958
I am.

279
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,500
But I promised her I wouldn’t drink.

280
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:57,666
Don’t get bullied by her.

281
00:15:57,666 --> 00:16:00,375
Athira made you quit smoking
for two years, remember?

282
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:02,750
Don’t talk about that bitch.

283
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:04,958
But you still keep
the bitch’s photo.

284
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:07,541
Aren’t you worried?

285
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:09,708
What if Nandan sees it?

286
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:11,125
I don't care.

287
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:12,916
He made us pose for it.
He took the photo.

288
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:14,500
He clicked it as well.

289
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:15,708
Jolly!

290
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:17,375
That's a lot of booze.

291
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:20,208
Are you sure that sir will go
with the foreigners?

292
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:22,166
I don’t want to drink
in his presence.

293
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:25,000
He’ll go for sure. He wouldn’t
want to curb our freedom.

294
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:26,125
Let's go.

295
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:29,625
The place looks beautiful.

296
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:32,333
Oh! Thank you so much.
I’m happy to hear that.

297
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:36,041
This is Maria. She will be
your caretaker for tonight.

298
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:40,958
And please make yourselves at
home and really enjoy yourselves.

299
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:44,541
- And we’ll be seeing you in the morning.
- Sure!

300
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:47,375
And just Hari… make sure
nobody eats on the bed.

301
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:49,875
Sure, sure! Guess he caught
your standards.

302
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:51,541
And... One more thing.

303
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:53,458
What is this?

304
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:55,500
- Have fun, guys!
- Wow!

305
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:57,208
Thank you, Chris.
Thank you so much!

306
00:16:57,291 --> 00:16:58,291
More booze!

307
00:16:58,791 --> 00:16:59,625
Thank you so much!

308
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:03,708
Aha, is she already in bed?

309
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:06,666
Why don’t you look around?

310
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:08,416
I don’t want to.

311
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:11,416
I’m sleepy. I don't want
to see the place.

312
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:13,708
We're raising a monk here.

313
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:14,958
Right?

314
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:17,166
I’ll sleep on the couch.

315
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:19,791
You two can sleep
peacefully in the bed.

316
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,208
I’m happy you came.

317
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:26,166
No need for sacrifices. We three
will easily fit in the bed.

318
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,583
You’re sleeping in the bed.

319
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:30,083
Okay!

320
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Yes?

321
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:39,458
Sir, do you think Hari is better
than me in the role?

322
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:42,000
No. I don't have
any such thoughts.

323
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:45,666
It took me 14 years to
play the hero’s role.

324
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:49,458
And to give that to somebody
who’s been with us only for two years..

325
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:54,500
Agreed, he’s a film actor...
But he’s an amateur in theatre.

326
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:59,666
You said you were going to just
try him out for a stage or two.

327
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:01,166
But this was the ninth.

328
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:05,625
Before he joined us, we hardly
performed three plays in a year.

329
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:09,458
Once I made him the hero, this is
the ninth show in 7 months.

330
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:14,958
He has great value in the market.
He’s a real crowd puller.

331
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:22,958
He’s the reason you all are
better paid now.

332
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:25,875
So...

333
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:28,541
I better shed my
hopes, right sir?

334
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:29,958
Vinay.

335
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:32,625
You’re only thinking about yourself.

336
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:35,708
All right, sir.

337
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:45,250
Listen. Deposit it on the 7th.
Not before.

338
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,208
They should pay me on the 5th.

339
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:49,291
Bank it on the 7th to be
on the safe side.

340
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:51,958
You never know with
film folk and money.

341
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:54,458
Hey...

342
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:56,208
Thank you.

343
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:58,541
This is a huge help.

344
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:01,750
I’ll return it. But give me some time.

345
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:05,375
Never mind! Take your own time.

346
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:07,125
But do me a favour.

347
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:11,083
Don't tell the others for God’s sake.

348
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:13,208
Or dozens will come borrowing.

349
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:15,375
Come on, time for a drink.

350
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:23,125
Can I tell you something?

351
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:26,541
Hari has many movies releasing.

352
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,583
Sure he’ll quit theatre soon.

353
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:31,666
I don’t think he’ll turn up
for the Delhi show either.

354
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:36,208
I don’t want that role
because of his generosity.

355
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,500
Oh my! Somebody is
seriously dejected.

356
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:42,791
I have the right medicine for you.

357
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:02,958
Better?

358
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:06,166
That is some medicine!

359
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:07,416
It’s a Steroid.

360
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:09,416
Only one dose though.

361
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:23,416
Six months. Or a year.
Take your time.

362
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:26,666
I’ll wait for you.

363
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:32,458
One minute.

364
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:39,666
It’s Shajitha. I should answer.

365
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:42,583
She must be looking for you.
She’ll get suspicious about us.

366
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:44,416
Well, let her.

367
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:48,750
- You don’t have a problem with that?
- No.

368
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:51,208
- No problem?-
- Not at all.

369
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:56,416
Come on, sing!
Let’s make it fun!

370
00:20:56,416 --> 00:20:58,875
Set the pitch!
Pitch is everything.

371
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,666
Hey Jolly, play the
pitch on that speaker.

372
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:03,791
- Wait.
- You smoking already?

373
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:06,041
- Did you ask for vodka?
- Yeah.

374
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:08,000
- This is the last one.
- Whatever!

375
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:11,250
The speaker is connected
to someone’s phone.

376
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:14,541
- Let me check.
- Whose phone is this?

377
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,791
- Never mind! Just sing!
- Okay, okay.

378
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Pour me a drink.

379
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:24,708
A lake shore full of romance

380
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:31,250
Long ago, one evening,
as the sky turned red

381
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:32,291
Superb!

382
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:38,375
A beautiful woman,
wearing a halo

383
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:43,000
Bloomed like a morning flower

384
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:48,750
And spread into my soul

385
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:51,500
Your turn!

386
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:55,333
Girl, why won’t you smile?

387
00:21:56,791 --> 00:22:00,166
Who doesn’t smile?

388
00:22:00,958 --> 00:22:02,000
Why won’t you, girl?

389
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:03,416
Who are you, girl?

390
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:05,708
Girl, why won’t you smile?

391
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:17,250
Is it because you have
no anklet bells?

392
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:21,666
Is it because you have
no nose-ring?

393
00:22:21,666 --> 00:22:23,500
Why doesn’t this girl smile?

394
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:45,000
- You drank vodka?
- No, whisky.

395
00:23:27,875 --> 00:23:29,500
That was wonderful!

396
00:23:29,791 --> 00:23:32,333
There’s no point in asking me
the same thing again and again.

397
00:23:32,375 --> 00:23:34,291
I’m stone sober! I promise.

398
00:23:34,333 --> 00:23:36,000
Okay. Who’s there?

399
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:37,208
Everyone.

400
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:38,416
See.

401
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:41,291
- Can you see?
- Oh! Anjali drinks?

402
00:23:41,416 --> 00:23:43,833
Sure! She can drink like a fish.

403
00:23:44,583 --> 00:23:45,583
Wait.

404
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:49,791
- I’ll put Shajitha on. She’ll tell you.
- Is he drunk, Shajitha?

405
00:23:49,833 --> 00:23:52,208
He hasn’t touched
a drop. Don’t worry.

406
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:53,916
I don’t trust these guys.

407
00:23:54,125 --> 00:23:55,625
He doesn’t break his promises.

408
00:23:55,916 --> 00:23:56,958
- Right, Jolly?
- Yeah!

409
00:23:57,416 --> 00:23:59,500
What else? When
are you coming back?

410
00:24:02,583 --> 00:24:04,541
- Hello.
- Hi.

411
00:24:04,666 --> 00:24:06,166
How are you?- I’m fine.

412
00:24:06,166 --> 00:24:07,625
You have nothing better to do?

413
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,333
Ask Anjali to wear
her clothes properly.

414
00:24:11,041 --> 00:24:13,750
You need to give men their space.
Or they get sneaky.

415
00:24:14,041 --> 00:24:15,916
You and I know him well!

416
00:24:16,291 --> 00:24:18,708
Look at her! Dead drunk
but still standing.

417
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:21,500
How’s life in Bhopal? Is it good?

418
00:24:21,541 --> 00:24:22,125
It's fine.

419
00:24:22,208 --> 00:24:26,125
This little pond beckons me.

420
00:24:26,541 --> 00:24:27,541
Oh God!

421
00:24:27,583 --> 00:24:29,375
A show is about to begin here.

422
00:24:29,375 --> 00:24:32,458
I can’t wait any more.

423
00:24:32,625 --> 00:24:33,833
Bye bye!

424
00:24:34,333 --> 00:24:35,375
Whose phone is this?

425
00:24:43,125 --> 00:24:44,250
He jumped in!

426
00:24:52,291 --> 00:24:54,416
Hey, no. I'll jump in on my own.

427
00:24:54,458 --> 00:24:56,708
- Come, Aji.
- I’ll jump in myself.

428
00:24:56,791 --> 00:24:58,208
Don't push!

429
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:02,666
Prashanth!

430
00:25:02,791 --> 00:25:04,750
- No, the cheque is in my pocket.
- Put it away then!

431
00:25:05,458 --> 00:25:06,958
Why are you hiding in that corner?

432
00:25:07,041 --> 00:25:08,041
No way!

433
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,500
Hey…!

434
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:10,750
Hey!

435
00:25:11,375 --> 00:25:13,041
No. I don't know how to swim!

436
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:15,750
Hey you!

437
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:19,083
Hey!

438
00:25:22,166 --> 00:25:23,625
What the hell have you done?

439
00:25:23,625 --> 00:25:27,250
What’s with you, man?
It’s just fun. Let’s enjoy.

440
00:25:27,375 --> 00:25:29,875
What’s your problem?
Look at her!

441
00:25:34,125 --> 00:25:37,583
Damn it! I'm sober again.
The pool was a bad idea.

442
00:25:38,333 --> 00:25:41,125
- In the mood for another drink?
- Always!

443
00:25:41,166 --> 00:25:44,166
I saw more bottles in Hari’s car.
But I don't feel like asking him.

444
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:46,958
- In his car, right?
- Yes.

445
00:25:47,416 --> 00:25:49,250
We can get it without asking.

446
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:52,625
- We only need the car keys, right?
- Right.

447
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,041
Let's see.

448
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:58,708
Common, the game is not over yet.

449
00:25:58,750 --> 00:25:59,583
Bye.

450
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:13,250
Anjali!

451
00:26:14,041 --> 00:26:14,541
Yeah.

452
00:26:14,833 --> 00:26:16,000
Can you spare a moment?

453
00:26:19,416 --> 00:26:21,875
It’s something personal.

454
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:28,125
Prasanth… shame on you.

455
00:26:29,208 --> 00:26:31,208
I know what you’re about to say.

456
00:26:32,166 --> 00:26:34,833
I can’t think of you like in that way.

457
00:26:37,125 --> 00:26:39,750
Forget about it. Right now.

458
00:26:42,541 --> 00:26:44,000
Let me go sleep.

459
00:26:44,125 --> 00:26:45,541
I’m really tipsy.

460
00:26:55,208 --> 00:26:57,666
Hari, can I have a cigarette?

461
00:26:58,083 --> 00:26:59,375
I don’t have any.

462
00:27:00,541 --> 00:27:03,208
Come on! I feel like a smoke.

463
00:27:03,375 --> 00:27:05,375
When I feel like it, I never get one.

464
00:27:08,083 --> 00:27:09,125
Here you go.

465
00:27:11,166 --> 00:27:12,333
But it’s empty.

466
00:27:12,375 --> 00:27:13,500
I told you!

467
00:27:15,583 --> 00:27:17,458
Come on. Give me a cigarette.

468
00:27:18,291 --> 00:27:20,041
There’s a packet in the car.

469
00:27:20,083 --> 00:27:21,083
Take it.

470
00:27:21,833 --> 00:27:23,083
But where are the keys?

471
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:26,125
In that basket on the dining table.

472
00:27:26,208 --> 00:27:28,833
Take only one.

473
00:27:29,625 --> 00:27:31,166
I’m happy with one.

474
00:27:33,166 --> 00:27:34,333
Goodness Delna!

475
00:27:34,458 --> 00:27:36,750
Hari was talking nonsense.
I can’t help it.

476
00:27:37,541 --> 00:27:39,041
I’m stone cold sober!

477
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:42,791
Please take my call.
We can talk about it.

478
00:27:43,375 --> 00:27:44,958
Please… just take the call.

479
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:52,250
Fuck it!

480
00:28:19,708 --> 00:28:23,666
"The Bluetooth device is
connected successfully."

481
00:28:51,583 --> 00:28:52,583
Hey...

482
00:28:53,583 --> 00:28:57,166
She has a mild fever.
I haven't turned on the AC.

483
00:28:57,375 --> 00:28:58,750
No problem. Take a rest.

484
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:27,916
We’re leaving in half an hour.

485
00:29:28,041 --> 00:29:29,291
Get ready soon!

486
00:29:29,916 --> 00:29:31,500
Shajitha, wake your husband up.

487
00:29:31,541 --> 00:29:33,541
I’ll wake the girl up.

488
00:29:33,833 --> 00:29:36,750
Chris and Emily will be here soon.
A quick thanks and we’re off.

489
00:29:36,791 --> 00:29:37,958
Gotta get back to work.

490
00:29:38,583 --> 00:29:42,041
Anjali left early this morning.
She took a cab around 5.30.

491
00:29:42,416 --> 00:29:44,333
She said there was
an emergency at work.

492
00:29:44,333 --> 00:29:46,250
- At 5.30 a.m.?
- Yes.

493
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:50,708
- Is the little one sick?
- She has a fever.

494
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Okay, then.

495
00:29:56,916 --> 00:30:01,083
“The person you’re calling is
not responding. Please try later."

496
00:30:26,666 --> 00:30:27,666
Hey.

497
00:30:27,875 --> 00:30:29,583
I spoke to your father-in-law...

498
00:30:30,625 --> 00:30:33,625
He wants to claim half of the
wedding expenses from you.

499
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:35,250
I’m happy to pay.

500
00:30:36,875 --> 00:30:38,708
What he’s asking for is fair.

501
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:40,958
But I need some more time.

502
00:30:41,083 --> 00:30:42,875
Don’t worry about that, Vinay...

503
00:30:43,291 --> 00:30:45,833
Dad is just annoyed about
our divorce plans.

504
00:30:47,583 --> 00:30:49,500
Give it a week and things
will calm down.

505
00:30:49,541 --> 00:30:53,625
Same with the court! 6 months of
counseling is just to cool people down.

506
00:30:53,833 --> 00:30:55,833
But if you both
plan to wave it off-

507
00:30:56,125 --> 00:30:57,125
'Anjali New'

508
00:30:58,041 --> 00:31:01,541
This divorce could be mutual for you.

509
00:31:02,791 --> 00:31:05,416
Families need time to
let things sink in.

510
00:31:05,916 --> 00:31:08,000
Go ahead with the counselling.

511
00:31:08,875 --> 00:31:11,666
We don’t intend
to trouble anyone.

512
00:31:22,791 --> 00:31:23,791
Bloody hell!

513
00:31:24,041 --> 00:31:26,458
You should've told me
that very morning.

514
00:31:26,541 --> 00:31:28,416
I would’ve cornered
that bastard.

515
00:31:29,166 --> 00:31:31,458
I’ve been calling you
for the last two days!

516
00:31:31,666 --> 00:31:34,208
Why the hell didn’t you pick up?

517
00:31:34,416 --> 00:31:35,583
You never pick up!

518
00:31:36,458 --> 00:31:38,666
Seriously? You’re
taking it out on me now?

519
00:31:42,416 --> 00:31:44,875
I still haven’t recovered
from the shock!

520
00:31:44,916 --> 00:31:46,083
I understand.

521
00:31:47,291 --> 00:31:51,291
Anjali, leave it to me.
I know what to do.

522
00:31:53,208 --> 00:31:55,708
He’s the one who should
leave the group. Not you.

523
00:31:55,875 --> 00:31:57,291
I promise I’ll get him kicked out.

524
00:31:57,375 --> 00:31:59,541
Vinay, please. I don’t want all that.

525
00:31:59,625 --> 00:32:02,416
I don’t want to tell
anyone about it.

526
00:32:03,041 --> 00:32:06,541
That’s the last thing I want.

527
00:32:06,583 --> 00:32:08,750
You don’t have to
say a thing. I’ll do it.

528
00:32:09,666 --> 00:32:12,125
But… you are sure
it was him, right?

529
00:32:14,333 --> 00:32:15,916
You want to see some proof?

530
00:32:22,375 --> 00:32:23,375
Madan.

531
00:32:23,916 --> 00:32:26,458
Sudha will do the dishes
and prepare food too.

532
00:32:28,208 --> 00:32:31,041
Let her know if you want her
to come every day.

533
00:32:34,166 --> 00:32:36,666
The clothes are all over
on the bed upstairs.

534
00:32:37,375 --> 00:32:39,791
Fold them when you get time.

535
00:32:40,958 --> 00:32:42,625
- Here.
- It’s okay, madam.

536
00:32:42,666 --> 00:32:43,916
Come on! Give him too.

537
00:32:49,416 --> 00:32:50,291
Madam.

538
00:32:50,333 --> 00:32:52,083
Madam, is your husband
is a theatre actor?

539
00:32:52,125 --> 00:32:53,750
I saw his photo in the papers
the other day.

540
00:32:53,833 --> 00:32:56,708
Don't be silly! It’s just a hobby.

541
00:32:56,791 --> 00:32:58,458
Have you heard ofThe Hindu?

542
00:32:58,625 --> 00:33:00,458
He worked there as an editor
for many years.

543
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,291
Sorry Madam... I didn’t
mean it in a bad way.

544
00:33:02,375 --> 00:33:05,666
Now go ahead and bitch about me
in your canteen.

545
00:33:05,791 --> 00:33:08,000
Still eating? Open the door!

546
00:33:11,458 --> 00:33:14,500
Hey Vinay! It’s been ages!
What’s up?

547
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:16,708
All good! Where are you headed?

548
00:33:16,916 --> 00:33:18,291
I’m off to Calicut for a raid.

549
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:21,625
I might get a promotion
if things go well.

550
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:23,291
I must go. I’m getting late.

551
00:33:26,583 --> 00:33:27,708
Is Madan home?

552
00:33:27,791 --> 00:33:30,583
He’s inside. Trying to
butter up the Gods.

553
00:33:30,833 --> 00:33:31,833
See you.

554
00:33:42,875 --> 00:33:44,333
So, why aren’t you
saying anything?

555
00:33:44,375 --> 00:33:45,958
I’m in shock.

556
00:33:47,208 --> 00:33:49,541
I don’t mind taking this up.

557
00:33:50,375 --> 00:33:52,625
But isn't it wrong
to tell everyone...

558
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:54,750
that she spoke
to 'me' about this?

559
00:33:54,875 --> 00:33:59,083
Try to understand. She’s trying
to get legal help.

560
00:33:59,666 --> 00:34:02,416
I’ve calmed her down somehow.

561
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:06,375
She’s in no state to talk about it.

562
00:34:07,083 --> 00:34:10,166
She was devastated
when she spoke to me.

563
00:34:10,458 --> 00:34:13,583
You’re right. It’ll be torture
for her to keep repeating the story.

564
00:34:13,625 --> 00:34:17,708
Correct! You are the most senior
in our group.

565
00:34:18,125 --> 00:34:20,625
They’ll take it seriously
only if you address this issue.

566
00:34:20,625 --> 00:34:22,416
Only then will we have a solution.

567
00:34:26,125 --> 00:34:27,208
Isn't this a starfruit?

568
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:28,250
Yes.

569
00:34:31,708 --> 00:34:33,333
Madan, who are you calling?

570
00:34:34,875 --> 00:34:36,041
Anjali...

571
00:34:36,791 --> 00:34:39,208
I don’t want to trouble you, my dear.

572
00:34:39,791 --> 00:34:41,250
Vinay is here.

573
00:34:42,375 --> 00:34:44,208
He has told me everything.

574
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:46,666
I’ll call a group meeting tomorrow.

575
00:34:46,791 --> 00:34:48,000
We’ll make a decision.

576
00:34:50,125 --> 00:34:53,916
It did happen, right?

577
00:34:54,375 --> 00:34:55,916
That’s all, my dear.

578
00:34:58,083 --> 00:34:59,833
Now she has
spoken to ‘me’! Right?

579
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:02,583
Tomorrow is a Sunday.
We’ll call everyone here.

580
00:35:02,916 --> 00:35:03,875
Sounds good.

581
00:35:03,916 --> 00:35:07,791
Aji. It’s a tiny balloon-like thing.

582
00:35:08,208 --> 00:35:10,083
It’s called a saccular aneurysm.

583
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:13,833
The risk of a rupture is high
since it’s in the brain.

584
00:35:13,875 --> 00:35:16,916
It can go unruptured for a lifetime,

585
00:35:17,541 --> 00:35:19,000
but in your case...

586
00:35:19,041 --> 00:35:21,125
Compared to the previous scan,
the bulge has widened.

587
00:35:21,125 --> 00:35:22,833
The bulging has widened.

588
00:35:22,875 --> 00:35:24,208
That’s why it is risky.

589
00:35:24,291 --> 00:35:26,541
But why does it have
to be in my head?

590
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,375
There could be multiple factors.

591
00:35:30,625 --> 00:35:32,000
Hypertension is one.

592
00:35:32,041 --> 00:35:33,583
- You used to smoke, right?
- Yeah.

593
00:35:33,583 --> 00:35:35,125
Smoking can be a major cause.

594
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:38,750
Could be hereditary...
or even stress...

595
00:35:38,791 --> 00:35:41,375
Let's call it fate.

596
00:35:41,458 --> 00:35:43,666
What can I do about it, doctor?

597
00:35:49,708 --> 00:35:51,541
Drivers don't get to choose
their holidays, Madan.

598
00:35:52,333 --> 00:35:55,250
Okay, I'll check with my boss.

599
00:35:56,958 --> 00:35:58,250
Athira…

600
00:35:58,333 --> 00:36:01,458
Don’t lean on that headrest.
Your hair is dripping with oil.

601
00:36:01,541 --> 00:36:02,916
If Sir finds out...

602
00:36:03,583 --> 00:36:04,958
I’ll lose my job!

603
00:36:05,541 --> 00:36:06,916
Who was that on the phone?

604
00:36:07,041 --> 00:36:08,458
Seems fishy.

605
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:10,875
Say that again?
Intermittent fasting.

606
00:36:10,958 --> 00:36:15,375
Avoid sugar completely. In one month
your belly fat will melt like butter.

607
00:36:15,625 --> 00:36:16,208
Really? One minute.

608
00:36:21,416 --> 00:36:22,416
Hello Madan.

609
00:36:23,333 --> 00:36:25,000
I’m at the temple. Shall I call you back?

610
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:27,291
Okay, tell me fast!

611
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:32,833
I’ll come straight from the shop.
I’ll pick up Santhosh on the way.

612
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:37,000
I’ll come by 11.30. See you there.
Okay.

613
00:36:38,875 --> 00:36:40,625
Doctor, let me tell
you something now.

614
00:36:42,208 --> 00:36:45,291
You say I'll be done in 20 minutes
if the balloon bursts. Let it be.

615
00:36:45,708 --> 00:36:47,250
There’s something
fascinating about that.

616
00:36:48,166 --> 00:36:52,291
I don’t have the time or
the money for treatment.

617
00:36:52,375 --> 00:36:55,541
Let’s pretend this conversation
never happened.

618
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:59,291
- I hope everyone’s been called.
- Did you call Selvan?

619
00:36:59,708 --> 00:37:00,708
Oh!

620
00:37:00,791 --> 00:37:04,166
Ask him not to tell that asshole,
or there’ll be chaos.

621
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:07,583
Why isn't he called?
I don’t understand.

622
00:37:09,125 --> 00:37:10,041
All right.

623
00:37:10,083 --> 00:37:10,583
Hey!

624
00:37:10,791 --> 00:37:14,541
One thing at a time! Finish your
call, then massage me.

625
00:37:17,666 --> 00:37:19,583
- Vinay!
- Yes?

626
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,750
Once we raise it in the group,
there’s no going back.

627
00:37:24,125 --> 00:37:26,250
He will defend himself, I’m sure.

628
00:37:27,125 --> 00:37:28,791
I hope Anjali won't back out.

629
00:37:28,833 --> 00:37:31,083
What nonsense!

630
00:37:31,125 --> 00:37:33,916
She was about to call the police
and post it on Facebook.

631
00:37:33,958 --> 00:37:35,916
Why the hell would she back out?

632
00:37:36,125 --> 00:37:38,625
I'm just anxious.

633
00:37:39,833 --> 00:37:40,833
Alright!

634
00:37:41,166 --> 00:37:42,750
Goodnight. See you tomorrow.

635
00:37:43,166 --> 00:37:44,166
Goodnight.

636
00:37:49,916 --> 00:37:50,958
Listen.

637
00:37:51,333 --> 00:37:53,333
First let’s find out
what it’s all about.

638
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:56,333
We’ll only buy booze
if everyone contributes.

639
00:37:57,166 --> 00:37:58,291
No need to buy booze.

640
00:37:59,416 --> 00:38:00,416
Why not?

641
00:38:01,583 --> 00:38:03,083
I said, no need to 'buy' booze.

642
00:38:04,083 --> 00:38:05,708
-Isn’t that Madan’s friend?
-I think so.

643
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:09,500
Madan, the sealant has worn out.
I’ve fixed it for now.

644
00:38:09,708 --> 00:38:11,750
Don’t use the toilet today.

645
00:38:12,083 --> 00:38:13,750
This photo is sharp.

646
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:16,666
-Cijin looks very pleased.
-No other paper has featured it.

647
00:38:17,416 --> 00:38:20,875
- Such a fantastic write-up!
- Hey, when did you get here?

648
00:38:21,291 --> 00:38:22,708
You guys were smoking there, right?

649
00:38:22,791 --> 00:38:24,791
I just passed by right in front of
you. Didn't you see me?

650
00:38:28,958 --> 00:38:30,250
Everyone's happy.

651
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:32,375
Madan!

652
00:38:32,708 --> 00:38:34,000
Sit down.

653
00:38:35,041 --> 00:38:36,291
Selvan! Grab a chair.

654
00:38:37,041 --> 00:38:37,625
Is everyone here?

655
00:38:37,791 --> 00:38:39,666
I'll try my best.

656
00:38:39,791 --> 00:38:40,875
Is Prasanth here?

657
00:38:41,333 --> 00:38:42,000
Not yet.

658
00:38:42,333 --> 00:38:44,916
- Jolly, call Prasanth.
- No need. I’m here.

659
00:38:44,958 --> 00:38:46,791
Bad traffic on the bridge.

660
00:38:46,875 --> 00:38:48,958
Forget the story. Sit down.

661
00:38:49,166 --> 00:38:50,583
Be careful. It’s hot.

662
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:59,083
Why a steel glass for me?
Stop such distinctions.

663
00:38:59,208 --> 00:39:01,875
I made coffee just for him
and he still complains!

664
00:39:01,958 --> 00:39:03,333
Don't drink it then.

665
00:39:03,375 --> 00:39:06,458
Aji, sit here. I can't stand his face.

666
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:08,000
Grow up guys!

667
00:39:11,416 --> 00:39:12,500
What was that?

668
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:14,375
A coconut fell on the roof.

669
00:39:16,666 --> 00:39:19,500
Madan, now tell us
why we are here.

670
00:39:19,583 --> 00:39:21,333
Everyone’s curious.

671
00:39:22,708 --> 00:39:23,750
-Tell.
-OK.

672
00:39:24,208 --> 00:39:25,250
Is everyone here?

673
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,333
I told you all that Hari is busy with
a shoot and can’t come.

674
00:39:32,291 --> 00:39:36,791
Truth is - I didn’t call him because
this meeting is about him.

675
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:38,375
What is it?

676
00:39:38,666 --> 00:39:41,458
- Something has happened.
- What?

677
00:39:41,791 --> 00:39:43,541
Anjali came to see me yesterday.

678
00:39:43,583 --> 00:39:45,541
- She came here?
- Yes.

679
00:39:45,791 --> 00:39:50,875
Last Sunday we were all
at the resort, right?

680
00:39:51,625 --> 00:39:56,875
Anjali told me that Hari
misbehaved with her that night.

681
00:39:58,583 --> 00:39:59,583
Misbehaved?

682
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:04,208
Misbehaved - as in? Did he
insult her or something?

683
00:40:04,541 --> 00:40:06,916
Such matters can be
brought to a compromise.

684
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,875
But this is something even worse.

685
00:40:09,291 --> 00:40:12,583
While she was asleep,
that filthy prick groped her.

686
00:40:12,666 --> 00:40:13,916
What the...!

687
00:40:21,708 --> 00:40:24,750
Wonderful! This was the one thing
that has never happened in our group.

688
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:25,458
Check it off now.

689
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:28,416
When you took Hari’s name, I knew
something nasty had happened.

690
00:40:28,541 --> 00:40:30,458
But when did this happen?

691
00:40:30,541 --> 00:40:31,750
Sudheer, I told you…

692
00:40:31,791 --> 00:40:34,666
She hasn't taken my call for the
last three days.

693
00:40:35,375 --> 00:40:36,458
Now I know why.

694
00:40:36,875 --> 00:40:38,458
I can't believe he'd do such a thing.

695
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:40,125
But he did.

696
00:40:40,125 --> 00:40:42,333
Madan, what exactly did she tell you?

697
00:40:42,625 --> 00:40:48,875
Around 2.30 at night, she was
sleeping on a sofa by the window.

698
00:40:49,625 --> 00:40:52,958
Not sure if he was just passing
by, or he went there deliberately.

699
00:40:53,791 --> 00:40:54,750
But that's when it happened.

700
00:40:54,833 --> 00:40:56,958
He put his hand through the
window and groped her.

701
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,500
So it happened in her sleep?

702
00:40:58,916 --> 00:41:00,000
Not when she was awake?

703
00:41:00,083 --> 00:41:01,541
She was asleep.

704
00:41:01,708 --> 00:41:03,041
So she didn’t see who it was.

705
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:05,125
She clearly saw
him running away.

706
00:41:05,458 --> 00:41:08,791
Did she say the window was open?

707
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:13,625
Cijin, he’s not a cop to
cross-examine her.

708
00:41:13,791 --> 00:41:16,208
- Can only cops ask such questions?
- It was silly anyway.

709
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:21,750
Listen… he is well
capable of doing that.

710
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:25,000
I was once his driver right,
hoping to be in the movies.

711
00:41:25,125 --> 00:41:28,125
Such bawdy jokes he was into.
I can't tell you.

712
00:41:28,666 --> 00:41:30,791
Stop talking rot!

713
00:41:31,541 --> 00:41:34,208
I’m gonna belt this bugger one day.

714
00:41:34,583 --> 00:41:36,416
How do we face her again?

715
00:41:38,833 --> 00:41:39,958
Wonderful!

716
00:41:40,083 --> 00:41:42,541
A girl who’s been with us
for 16 years

717
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:45,083
was groped by an asshole who
joined us only two years ago,

718
00:41:45,208 --> 00:41:47,208
and we’re being frivolous about it?

719
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:50,750
Exactly! Bring him here and
let’s beat the shit out of him.

720
00:41:50,958 --> 00:41:54,541
Aji, there’s no point in being
emotional about it.

721
00:41:54,958 --> 00:41:57,916
We've just heard about it.
We should discuss more.

722
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Right!

723
00:41:59,791 --> 00:42:01,458
Discussions are
our forte, right?

724
00:42:01,625 --> 00:42:02,666
Santhosh...

725
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:06,916
She’s the only one in this group
who cares to call me to check on me.

726
00:42:07,041 --> 00:42:08,833
So yes, I am emotional
about this.

727
00:42:08,916 --> 00:42:10,791
Beat him up if you want.

728
00:42:11,166 --> 00:42:14,250
But it must be a unanimous
decision. That’s my point.

729
00:42:14,291 --> 00:42:15,666
Santhosh, listen to this...

730
00:42:15,875 --> 00:42:19,125
if he did it, he didn’t care that
we were all there that night.

731
00:42:19,333 --> 00:42:24,083
We are just buffoons for him.

732
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:27,041
- Guess you had a slip of tongue!
- What?

733
00:42:27,375 --> 00:42:28,666
You said 'if' he did it.

734
00:42:29,166 --> 00:42:31,000
So we need to
make sure he did it.

735
00:42:31,458 --> 00:42:32,125
Oh!

736
00:42:32,708 --> 00:42:34,208
What are you trying to say?

737
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:37,166
Are you saying he
didn’t do it to her?

738
00:42:37,708 --> 00:42:39,250
We are not arguing about that.

739
00:42:39,333 --> 00:42:41,250
But a mere
accusation isn't enough.

740
00:42:41,375 --> 00:42:44,708
When it comes to Anjali,
that’s more than enough.

741
00:42:46,458 --> 00:42:48,916
See, we're dealing
with a serious matter.

742
00:42:49,458 --> 00:42:51,416
She was in tears when
she told me about it.

743
00:42:51,541 --> 00:42:54,458
The girl is in a state of shock.
Try and understand that.

744
00:42:54,708 --> 00:42:56,375
Hey! Where are you going?

745
00:42:56,541 --> 00:42:57,916
Carry on. I’ll be right back.

746
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,875
Prasanth, we are
discussing something serious.

747
00:43:01,041 --> 00:43:02,375
I feel uneasy after hearing all this.

748
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:03,541
I need a smoke.

749
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:08,083
Another excuse
for him to smoke!

750
00:43:09,166 --> 00:43:09,916
Hey.

751
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:11,250
Hey Jolly.

752
00:43:11,291 --> 00:43:15,208
Hari and you were sharing the
same room that night, right?

753
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:18,333
- Hari, Sanosh and me.
- We shared the same room.

754
00:43:18,458 --> 00:43:20,708
- Was he very drunk?
- Somewhat.

755
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:23,583
That’s it! A sober mind
would not do such a thing.

756
00:43:23,916 --> 00:43:25,958
We should stop drinking.

757
00:43:26,208 --> 00:43:29,875
You’ve all been drinking
too much recently.

758
00:43:29,958 --> 00:43:31,083
And you know it.

759
00:43:31,166 --> 00:43:33,416
He didn’t do it
because he was drunk.

760
00:43:33,916 --> 00:43:36,708
The truth is that alcohol
brought out his true nature.

761
00:43:36,791 --> 00:43:38,166
Exactly!

762
00:43:38,166 --> 00:43:39,958
We were all drunk,
for that matter.

763
00:43:40,083 --> 00:43:42,166
You and I don’t drink.

764
00:43:43,666 --> 00:43:45,041
Were you drunk, Jolly?

765
00:43:45,083 --> 00:43:46,791
- He quit drinking.
- Right!

766
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,333
Except for us three,
all the others were drunk.

767
00:43:50,666 --> 00:43:51,958
Anjali was drunk too.

768
00:43:53,791 --> 00:43:54,333
So what?

769
00:43:54,458 --> 00:43:57,333
Just reminding you since
you were doing a count.

770
00:43:59,666 --> 00:44:00,958
Yeah, she was drunk too.

771
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:04,375
This wasn’t the first time
we’ve partied together.

772
00:44:04,583 --> 00:44:06,875
Have we ever
misbehaved with her?

773
00:44:06,916 --> 00:44:08,166
Forget about misbehaving...

774
00:44:08,208 --> 00:44:10,750
Has any one of us even thought
of her in that way?

775
00:44:14,291 --> 00:44:15,208
No right?

776
00:44:16,625 --> 00:44:18,041
So don’t blame it on alcohol.

777
00:44:18,958 --> 00:44:20,166
Blame it on him.

778
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:26,291
- Madan, did she tell you in person?
- Yes, she did.

779
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:27,333
When?

780
00:44:27,791 --> 00:44:30,458
Yesterday. Why make him repeat it?

781
00:44:33,083 --> 00:44:37,416
I’m not being suspicious…
But I disagree with something...

782
00:44:38,541 --> 00:44:42,083
Today is Sunday.
It happened last Sunday.

783
00:44:42,833 --> 00:44:47,708
Why did it take her so long to tell us?
She could’ve told one of us the next day.

784
00:44:48,125 --> 00:44:49,916
Why did she keep silent
for a whole week?

785
00:44:51,458 --> 00:44:53,583
What’s that fucking question?

786
00:44:54,916 --> 00:44:57,375
Someone groped her breasts.
Damn it!

787
00:44:57,458 --> 00:45:00,708
It wasn’t a purse she lost to
sing out to you the next day.

788
00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:03,500
Who talked about breasts?
Madan never said anything.

789
00:45:03,791 --> 00:45:04,875
He’s mouthing off at me!

790
00:45:04,958 --> 00:45:05,958
You dumbhead!

791
00:45:05,958 --> 00:45:10,208
That’s what groping means!
Does Madan have to spell it out?

792
00:45:10,208 --> 00:45:12,500
I can call you names too.
Don’t you dare!

793
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:13,541
Out with it!

794
00:45:13,583 --> 00:45:15,041
- Cijin...
- Tell him!

795
00:45:15,083 --> 00:45:19,083
I don't like his tone.
Wait, let me finish.

796
00:45:19,125 --> 00:45:20,958
He sounded wrong
from the beginning!

797
00:45:21,083 --> 00:45:23,458
There are seniors here.
Let them talk.

798
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:25,375
Who are you to talk?

799
00:45:25,458 --> 00:45:27,041
This was meant to be a
damn discussion.

800
00:45:27,166 --> 00:45:29,208
- Leave it, man.
- Stop bossing around!

801
00:45:29,625 --> 00:45:31,541
- You sit.
- Sit down.

802
00:45:31,750 --> 00:45:34,125
Sit down. Let’s talk it through.

803
00:45:34,333 --> 00:45:36,166
You veterans discuss it then.

804
00:45:36,208 --> 00:45:37,541
- Cijin... Stop it.
- Tell him!

805
00:45:38,208 --> 00:45:39,750
- We always do this.
- Sit down.

806
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:44,291
Is it over now?
Done with the drama?

807
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:48,833
Let me tell you what I think.

808
00:45:49,458 --> 00:45:53,541
If this ever goes public,
we’ll all die of shame.

809
00:45:54,375 --> 00:45:57,083
Both Anjali and
Hari are dear to us.

810
00:45:57,333 --> 00:45:59,041
So we should call them here.

811
00:45:59,083 --> 00:46:02,500
Talk to them and then
reach a compromise.

812
00:46:03,250 --> 00:46:05,916
That’s my opinion. Now don’t
jump down my throat.

813
00:46:06,041 --> 00:46:08,541
Santhosh, we've gathered
here to speak our minds.

814
00:46:08,583 --> 00:46:09,916
So let’s talk.

815
00:46:11,666 --> 00:46:13,041
Sudheer, why are you so silent?

816
00:46:13,083 --> 00:46:14,083
Sudheer.

817
00:46:14,291 --> 00:46:17,416
He should be expelled at once.

818
00:46:18,625 --> 00:46:20,375
Don't we have
'Arangu's' letterhead?

819
00:46:20,375 --> 00:46:23,166
Write the dismissal matter,
get it sealed by Sir.

820
00:46:23,166 --> 00:46:25,375
Give Hari his notice.
That's the first step.

821
00:46:26,708 --> 00:46:28,708
Other investigations can wait.

822
00:46:30,833 --> 00:46:33,041
This is my decision.
Not my opinion.

823
00:46:33,125 --> 00:46:35,125
Don’t go. Sit down.

824
00:46:35,166 --> 00:46:38,958
I’m not going anywhere.
I need a smoke.

825
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,916
Or I might feel like beating
him up myself.

826
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:45,458
Don’t be long. Ask Prasanth to
come back inside.

827
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:47,458
Madan! Sudheer is right.

828
00:46:48,083 --> 00:46:49,916
We can’t have Hari
in the group anymore.

829
00:46:50,375 --> 00:46:52,666
Sudheer looks as if we
did something wrong.

830
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,916
Remember the havoc he created
in Hyderabad in Jolly’s name?

831
00:46:57,375 --> 00:46:58,750
In the end he’s
always the good one.

832
00:46:58,791 --> 00:46:59,791
Santhosh!

833
00:47:00,875 --> 00:47:04,000
The idea of compromising was so naive.

834
00:47:04,875 --> 00:47:06,333
I use that with kids at school.

835
00:47:06,416 --> 00:47:12,833
By compromise, I didn’t mean
baby talk or gentle advice.

836
00:47:13,250 --> 00:47:15,208
This should not come out.
No matter what.

837
00:47:15,291 --> 00:47:18,666
If this ever did - it would mean
the end of our group.

838
00:47:19,250 --> 00:47:20,416
Bear that in mind.

839
00:47:23,541 --> 00:47:26,500
We just heard about it,
and we're gonna dismiss him?

840
00:47:26,541 --> 00:47:27,583
Is it right?

841
00:47:27,833 --> 00:47:29,750
Sudheer is our close friend,

842
00:47:30,208 --> 00:47:32,333
but I don’t support his suggestion.

843
00:47:32,625 --> 00:47:34,125
This is precisely what we want.

844
00:47:34,416 --> 00:47:35,833
Everyone should talk freely.

845
00:47:36,125 --> 00:47:37,875
And give their opinions.

846
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:43,500
Madan, when it comes to something
like this, we need to clarify things.

847
00:47:43,791 --> 00:47:45,625
So it isn’t right to fly into a rage.

848
00:47:45,875 --> 00:47:49,208
Can we think for the girl now?

849
00:47:49,666 --> 00:47:51,666
A little empathy
would be good.

850
00:47:52,333 --> 00:47:53,333
Madan!

851
00:47:53,666 --> 00:47:54,875
Isn’t that the inverter sound?

852
00:47:54,916 --> 00:47:56,375
The battery is low, I guess.

853
00:47:56,416 --> 00:47:57,583
Where is it?
I’ll take a look.

854
00:47:57,666 --> 00:47:59,625
It’s upstairs.
I’ll show you.

855
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:02,958
What’s with Prasanth today?

856
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:05,208
He is usually very outspoken.

857
00:48:07,250 --> 00:48:08,583
What was all that noise?

858
00:48:08,791 --> 00:48:10,625
Cijin and Vinay are arguing.

859
00:48:10,958 --> 00:48:12,458
Well, Cijin has got a sharp tongue.

860
00:48:13,208 --> 00:48:15,000
I was thinking
of calling Anjali.

861
00:48:15,958 --> 00:48:18,458
Not now. Let's first
come to a decision.

862
00:48:20,333 --> 00:48:23,916
So yes, Hari called me a
couple of days back.

863
00:48:24,291 --> 00:48:27,250
He asked if I knew any caterers
for his kid’s birthday party.

864
00:48:27,791 --> 00:48:31,166
He seemed very casual.
He didn’t sound awkward at all.

865
00:48:31,625 --> 00:48:33,416
Yes. He called me too.

866
00:48:33,458 --> 00:48:35,708
Random chat.

867
00:48:35,833 --> 00:48:39,041
And some movie gossip as usual.

868
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:41,083
I was all ears.

869
00:48:41,416 --> 00:48:44,291
After we returned from the
resort, he called me too.

870
00:48:44,416 --> 00:48:46,833
He wanted to know the
price of a folk drum.

871
00:48:47,166 --> 00:48:49,416
Like you said,
he sounded relaxed.

872
00:48:50,250 --> 00:48:51,833
I am wondering.

873
00:48:51,958 --> 00:48:54,875
Is it possible to be so casual,
after doing such an obscene thing?

874
00:48:55,583 --> 00:48:58,750
It doesn’t make sense.
I have my doubts.

875
00:48:59,166 --> 00:49:00,958
That’s called good acting!

876
00:49:01,250 --> 00:49:03,000
You didn’t get it?

877
00:49:03,083 --> 00:49:08,416
He called you guys to see whether
you had heard anything.

878
00:49:09,208 --> 00:49:11,458
Let Madan come.
I have something to say.

879
00:49:12,583 --> 00:49:14,625
He’s a very tricky man.

880
00:49:14,708 --> 00:49:16,958
How long has he
been in our group?

881
00:49:17,041 --> 00:49:20,041
- Two-and-a-half-years.
- Two-and-a-half-years...

882
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:22,333
He grabbed the hero’s
role in no time at all.

883
00:49:22,375 --> 00:49:23,375
Not a simple task.

884
00:49:23,791 --> 00:49:26,458
Vinay used to play
the hero so well.

885
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,541
Hari has ruined it.

886
00:49:28,708 --> 00:49:30,500
No, Aji.

887
00:49:31,125 --> 00:49:33,333
The group did benefit
from his arrival..

888
00:49:35,208 --> 00:49:36,416
Jolly, What’s the problem?

889
00:49:36,875 --> 00:49:40,416
The battery water must’ve dried up.
We've to remove the casing.

890
00:49:40,583 --> 00:49:43,416
Jolly, is Hari’s marriage in trouble?

891
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:44,833
How would I know?

892
00:49:46,125 --> 00:49:47,375
You see them often.

893
00:49:47,416 --> 00:49:48,416
Come on, Cijin...

894
00:49:48,625 --> 00:49:51,791
Fixing their plumbing doesn't mean
I know about their personal problems.

895
00:49:52,291 --> 00:49:55,083
I do my job, get paid
and go home.

896
00:49:55,166 --> 00:49:57,208
I don’t pry into their lives.

897
00:49:58,833 --> 00:50:01,000
There are no lights blinking.

898
00:50:02,625 --> 00:50:05,291
Please check it tomorrow.
Power cuts are common here.

899
00:50:05,458 --> 00:50:06,458
Don’t forget. Okay.

900
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
All right.

901
00:50:08,958 --> 00:50:09,958
- Is it broken?
- It needs fixing.

902
00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:12,041
Yeah... needs fixing.

903
00:50:13,666 --> 00:50:15,750
Madan, you must be sterner.

904
00:50:16,333 --> 00:50:17,750
They are going haywire.

905
00:50:17,875 --> 00:50:19,375
Did you hear them carry on
about compromise?

906
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:22,875
We can only present the problem.
We can't decide for them.

907
00:50:23,166 --> 00:50:24,291
Let them speak!

908
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:32,500
Why did you put on an act
when I started talking?

909
00:50:32,583 --> 00:50:34,291
An act? Meaning?

910
00:50:34,958 --> 00:50:37,958
“Did Hari insult her or something?”

911
00:50:38,041 --> 00:50:40,916
I had to pretend I was
hearing it for the first time.

912
00:50:41,625 --> 00:50:43,625
Yes, but don’t overdo it.

913
00:50:45,541 --> 00:50:47,000
Here. I found it.

914
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:49,458
If this ever came out,

915
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:53,166
we’ll never get a female artist
agreeing to joining our group.

916
00:50:53,291 --> 00:50:59,458
No one fancies acting on stage
anymore as it is.

917
00:50:59,583 --> 00:51:01,750
Do you think she’ll
keep quiet about this?

918
00:51:02,916 --> 00:51:05,583
She’s won’t let it go.
if it happened at all.

919
00:51:05,750 --> 00:51:07,708
What do you mean 'if it happened'?

920
00:51:07,791 --> 00:51:09,041
Would she lie
about such a thing?

921
00:51:10,125 --> 00:51:13,208
- She would. She could.
- Right, Santhosh?

922
00:51:13,375 --> 00:51:14,583
Don't be silly.

923
00:51:14,666 --> 00:51:17,250
I know what you’re talking about.
This is far from it.

924
00:51:17,291 --> 00:51:18,416
What’s that story?

925
00:51:19,041 --> 00:51:20,291
It happened long ago.

926
00:51:20,375 --> 00:51:22,958
Aji and Selvan know about it.
Remember the marriage issue?

927
00:51:23,041 --> 00:51:23,750
Oh that...

928
00:51:23,833 --> 00:51:24,875
Don’t you know, Sudheer?

929
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,500
Not until someone tells me.

930
00:51:27,291 --> 00:51:28,291
I’ll tell you.

931
00:51:29,041 --> 00:51:30,541
It happened four years ago.

932
00:51:30,666 --> 00:51:33,333
I received a marriage proposal
from Anjali’s cousin's family.

933
00:51:34,208 --> 00:51:35,916
I met the family and
we liked each other.

934
00:51:35,958 --> 00:51:36,958
It was almost confirmed.

935
00:51:38,208 --> 00:51:40,250
After two weeks
they rejected me.

936
00:51:40,458 --> 00:51:41,500
You know why?

937
00:51:42,208 --> 00:51:45,708
Anjali didn’t want it to happen.

938
00:51:46,125 --> 00:51:48,666
Tell them what she said about me.

939
00:51:49,083 --> 00:51:52,083
She said he has a bad temper
and smokes weed all the time.

940
00:51:52,708 --> 00:51:54,416
I hadn’t touched that shit in all my life.

941
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:56,000
How did you know that Anjali said it?

942
00:51:56,083 --> 00:51:58,041
Her brother told me.
He was a friend.

943
00:51:58,125 --> 00:51:59,416
Didn’t you confront her?

944
00:51:59,708 --> 00:52:03,083
What for? She was not interested
in having me in her family.

945
00:52:03,166 --> 00:52:05,791
So she put an end to it.
And I didn’t persist.

946
00:52:06,958 --> 00:52:07,750
This is what...

947
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:12,250
Ah, these women! They always
think about what benefits them.

948
00:52:13,166 --> 00:52:14,791
You’re screwed if you trust them.

949
00:52:14,875 --> 00:52:15,916
Sanosh!

950
00:52:16,666 --> 00:52:18,666
It’s better to avoid such statements.
You shouldn’t talk like that.

951
00:52:18,750 --> 00:52:21,000
But that’s been my experience.
I’m a martyr!

952
00:52:21,041 --> 00:52:24,416
Whatever! Don’t drag your
personal affairs into this discussion.

953
00:52:24,458 --> 00:52:28,833
You’d be fired if you spoke
like that in an office.

954
00:52:28,916 --> 00:52:30,750
I am not getting
fired here, am I?

955
00:52:30,833 --> 00:52:33,416
Stop talking like that anywhere.

956
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:35,333
I have my freedom of speech.

957
00:52:35,416 --> 00:52:38,500
Yes, you do. But freedom comes
with a sense of responsibility.

958
00:52:38,583 --> 00:52:41,666
You can patronize the kids
at your school. But not me.

959
00:52:42,125 --> 00:52:43,416
The inverter isn't working.

960
00:52:43,666 --> 00:52:45,000
Nothing’s wrong
with the battery.

961
00:52:45,125 --> 00:52:46,458
Call the electricity board.

962
00:52:46,791 --> 00:52:49,291
I can call, but they won't pick up.

963
00:52:49,333 --> 00:52:51,916
Then let's sit outside.
It’s too hot in here.

964
00:52:52,041 --> 00:52:53,375
That’s right.
Let’s go.

965
00:53:26,958 --> 00:53:29,833
Sudheer, wasn't she in Shajitha's
room that night?

966
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,583
- Yes.
- Did Shajitha know anything?

967
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:33,291
- Did she say something?
- Exactly!

968
00:53:33,375 --> 00:53:35,875
Usually, the roommate
will come to know.

969
00:53:35,916 --> 00:53:37,958
What do you mean ‘usually’?

970
00:53:38,583 --> 00:53:41,208
- Have you ever been groped?
- Why would anyone grope me?

971
00:53:41,291 --> 00:53:43,041
- I am a man!
- Really?

972
00:53:43,125 --> 00:53:44,500
What do you mean usually...

973
00:53:44,583 --> 00:53:46,541
- Stop bickering about everything.
- Leave it.

974
00:53:48,250 --> 00:53:49,541
When I spoke to Shajitha,

975
00:53:49,791 --> 00:53:51,000
She said that

976
00:53:51,166 --> 00:53:53,041
Anjali was worried about
something at work

977
00:53:53,041 --> 00:53:56,250
so she took an uber and left very early.

978
00:53:56,291 --> 00:53:58,291
- Nothing else?
- No, that’s all she said.

979
00:53:58,458 --> 00:54:02,041
So the next step is to inform
Sir as soon as possible.

980
00:54:02,166 --> 00:54:04,541
Exactly! Let him
take a decision.

981
00:54:04,625 --> 00:54:08,500
No, Selvan. We should decide
and then let him know.

982
00:54:08,583 --> 00:54:12,458
Anjali would not have told Madan
if she wanted sir to decide.

983
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:13,625
She wanted us to decide.

984
00:54:13,708 --> 00:54:16,541
We must tell sir the matter
this evening.

985
00:54:16,666 --> 00:54:18,166
He’s flying out tomorrow.

986
00:54:18,208 --> 00:54:20,500
- To Nepal?
- Yeah, Nepal.

987
00:54:20,708 --> 00:54:22,541
So let’s not drag this out.

988
00:54:22,666 --> 00:54:25,333
Tell me your decision
about Hari, one by one.

989
00:54:25,458 --> 00:54:26,916
- Can I ask something?
- Yes.

990
00:54:27,083 --> 00:54:28,708
You are very close to Anjali,

991
00:54:28,750 --> 00:54:30,791
why didn’t she tell you first?

992
00:54:31,041 --> 00:54:32,375
Exactly what I had in mind!

993
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:34,416
But who am I to ask, right?

994
00:54:35,791 --> 00:54:37,458
Yes, we are very close.

995
00:54:38,583 --> 00:54:40,125
She tried calling me several times.

996
00:54:40,208 --> 00:54:43,625
I was in the middle of counseling,
I couldn’t take the call.

997
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:48,458
I had no clue she was calling
to tell me about this.

998
00:54:49,375 --> 00:54:50,708
Come on!
How would he know?

999
00:54:51,250 --> 00:54:53,958
Now tell me what
to do with Hari.

1000
00:54:54,666 --> 00:54:56,500
I've already told you.
Expel him!

1001
00:54:57,250 --> 00:55:00,708
People should know we expelled him
as soon as we found out.

1002
00:55:00,833 --> 00:55:04,166
A girl accuses someone and
we chuck him out immediately.

1003
00:55:04,458 --> 00:55:05,833
Is that right?

1004
00:55:06,416 --> 00:55:08,375
Did you just say 'a girl'?

1005
00:55:08,416 --> 00:55:09,500
Hey, Sanosh!

1006
00:55:09,625 --> 00:55:10,833
Is Anjali just any girl?

1007
00:55:10,875 --> 00:55:12,041
She's one of us!

1008
00:55:12,166 --> 00:55:16,291
We must hear his side of the story
before deciding. That’s all I meant.

1009
00:55:16,375 --> 00:55:19,291
Do you mean to expel him
permanently? Or temporarily?

1010
00:55:19,375 --> 00:55:20,500
What's on your mind, Sudheer?

1011
00:55:20,583 --> 00:55:22,166
He should be expelled forever.

1012
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:26,125
I don't support that. I agree
what he did was despicable.

1013
00:55:26,333 --> 00:55:27,625
He deserves to be punished.

1014
00:55:27,708 --> 00:55:31,333
So suspend him for six months
or a year.

1015
00:55:31,666 --> 00:55:34,541
And when she has calmed down
and is willing to forgive him,

1016
00:55:34,750 --> 00:55:36,708
we’ll bring him back.
This is what I think.

1017
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:39,666
Yea right!
Jesus Christ is back I guess.

1018
00:55:39,708 --> 00:55:42,208
Forgive him! Like hell.
Wake up, man.

1019
00:55:42,250 --> 00:55:45,708
Stop arguing. I was only
voicing my opinion.

1020
00:55:45,791 --> 00:55:47,666
I’m doing the same thing.

1021
00:55:47,833 --> 00:55:49,875
He doesn’t deserve
to be forgiven.

1022
00:55:49,916 --> 00:55:51,666
He must be expelled.
That’s what I believe.

1023
00:55:51,708 --> 00:55:53,416
Sure! Everyone knows your reasoning.

1024
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:55,625
Stop it, Santhosh!
Let's not digress.

1025
00:55:55,666 --> 00:55:58,250
No, no. Wait. Say that again?

1026
00:55:58,333 --> 00:56:00,250
Why should I say?
It's no secret.

1027
00:56:00,916 --> 00:56:05,291
Oh! I was wondering why
no one brought it up before.

1028
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,875
You mean I have grudge against
Hari for taking my lead role.

1029
00:56:08,958 --> 00:56:10,500
That’s it, right?

1030
00:56:11,166 --> 00:56:15,458
Even if it involved my own father,
my opinion wouldn’t change.

1031
00:56:15,541 --> 00:56:16,541
He should be expelled.

1032
00:56:17,416 --> 00:56:18,416
Bullshit.

1033
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:20,833
Okay! Okay! Next.

1034
00:56:21,208 --> 00:56:22,208
Jolly?

1035
00:56:22,583 --> 00:56:25,041
Don’t cross-question
when someone's speaking.

1036
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:29,291
- Go ahead, Jolly.
- Let others talk. I’ll tell you later.

1037
00:56:29,625 --> 00:56:31,458
I see it in a different light.

1038
00:56:31,833 --> 00:56:35,708
In a way, we played a part in
what Hari did to Anjali.

1039
00:56:35,708 --> 00:56:37,750
- What part?
- You want to know?

1040
00:56:37,791 --> 00:56:39,791
He’s been with us for
over two years now.

1041
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:44,583
If Hari still had the mind to grope
a fellow actor, we better quit theatre

1042
00:56:44,583 --> 00:56:49,625
and do some farming instead.
That's more dignified.

1043
00:56:49,666 --> 00:56:52,166
- Can I tell you something?
- Let me finish. Don’t interrupt.

1044
00:56:52,208 --> 00:56:54,541
We never considered him
one of us.

1045
00:56:54,666 --> 00:56:56,791
That’s why this happened.

1046
00:56:57,041 --> 00:56:59,708
Doesn’t matter what
sort of a person he is.

1047
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:04,208
We are a theatre group, yet we failed
to bring about a change in him.

1048
00:57:04,541 --> 00:57:06,125
Let's accept that first.

1049
00:57:06,166 --> 00:57:09,208
How is it possible to know a person
inside out? Be practical.

1050
00:57:09,250 --> 00:57:11,083
You said not to cross-question.

1051
00:57:11,083 --> 00:57:12,125
Let him speak.

1052
00:57:12,166 --> 00:57:14,166
I didn’t ask you to
know him inside out.

1053
00:57:14,333 --> 00:57:16,791
I meant that our art
hasn’t reformed him.

1054
00:57:17,083 --> 00:57:18,083
Got it?

1055
00:57:19,583 --> 00:57:20,833
Have you finished?

1056
00:57:21,750 --> 00:57:23,750
- Yes.
- What are you trying to say?

1057
00:57:23,875 --> 00:57:27,041
- Should we throw him out or not?
- Throw him out or keep him?

1058
00:57:27,750 --> 00:57:29,958
Isn’t there something
better we can do, as artists!

1059
00:57:31,125 --> 00:57:32,125
Selvan…

1060
00:57:32,250 --> 00:57:33,875
Forget art and crap!

1061
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,041
Can’t you think like a commoner?

1062
00:57:36,125 --> 00:57:40,500
That’s what we’re doing. If this had
happened in a flat or a club,

1063
00:57:40,750 --> 00:57:43,750
how would a commoner react?

1064
00:57:43,750 --> 00:57:45,750
Is being a commoner enough
is my question.

1065
00:57:45,833 --> 00:57:48,791
Your principles are
easier said than done!

1066
00:57:48,875 --> 00:57:50,375
Put yourself in her place.

1067
00:57:50,416 --> 00:57:52,333
I have only one thing to say.

1068
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:54,750
He groped her today. He’ll do
something worse tomorrow.

1069
00:57:54,875 --> 00:57:57,375
He’s that kind of man.
You don’t really know him well.

1070
00:57:57,916 --> 00:57:58,916
Prasanth.

1071
00:57:59,166 --> 00:58:00,750
Don’t ask me, Madan.

1072
00:58:01,083 --> 00:58:03,250
I’ll go with the group’s decision.

1073
00:58:03,750 --> 00:58:05,000
I have nothing else to say.

1074
00:58:05,250 --> 00:58:05,958
Cijin.

1075
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:08,458
Hari has insulted me a lot.

1076
00:58:08,750 --> 00:58:10,250
I really don't like him.

1077
00:58:10,791 --> 00:58:12,875
But we can’t just go by
what she says.

1078
00:58:12,958 --> 00:58:14,833
- So what can we do?
- Prove it!

1079
00:58:15,125 --> 00:58:18,041
Let things clear up.
Don’t rush into a decision.

1080
00:58:18,125 --> 00:58:20,708
Prove it? Who should
prove it to whom?

1081
00:58:20,833 --> 00:58:22,708
She should prove
to us that he did it.

1082
00:58:22,791 --> 00:58:24,375
Don’t you want any proof??

1083
00:58:24,458 --> 00:58:25,708
What a great idea!

1084
00:58:25,791 --> 00:58:29,458
After what she has gone through,
she must now prove it?

1085
00:58:29,750 --> 00:58:33,416
A girl was groped in the middle of
the night. What proof do you want?

1086
00:58:33,541 --> 00:58:35,041
I don't know... Like...

1087
00:58:35,208 --> 00:58:38,833
Sudheer’s wife was in her room
that night. She can be a witness.

1088
00:58:39,041 --> 00:58:41,500
Did the resort have CCTV?

1089
00:58:41,875 --> 00:58:42,958
Have any of you seen it?

1090
00:58:48,625 --> 00:58:50,916
CCTV! Bullshit!

1091
00:58:52,333 --> 00:58:53,750
Who’ll check the CCTV?

1092
00:58:53,958 --> 00:58:56,500
We’d have to call the police.
They won’t give us the footage.

1093
00:58:57,250 --> 00:59:01,416
For the sake of the group, it's best
we don’t drag the police into this.

1094
00:59:01,666 --> 00:59:02,708
Am I right, Sudheer?

1095
00:59:02,750 --> 00:59:03,750
Absolutely!

1096
00:59:04,166 --> 00:59:06,166
There are a few things
you should know.

1097
00:59:06,833 --> 00:59:08,583
If she files a case
against him,

1098
00:59:08,583 --> 00:59:10,625
it falls under Section 354, which
is a non-bailable offence.

1099
00:59:10,666 --> 00:59:11,916
He’ll be arrested.

1100
00:59:12,250 --> 00:59:15,541
Once they arrest Hari and since
we were all there too,

1101
00:59:15,833 --> 00:59:19,750
the police will question all of us.
Think about it.

1102
00:59:20,833 --> 00:59:26,208
Madan, he hasn’t acted in many
movies but he’s already a celebrity.

1103
00:59:26,333 --> 00:59:30,333
If this news leaks out,
the media will love it.

1104
00:59:30,583 --> 00:59:34,000
Our group’s name will be said
a thousand times in the news.

1105
00:59:34,583 --> 00:59:38,250
We’re lucky she didn’t take
the matter to the police.

1106
00:59:38,375 --> 00:59:39,375
Okay, then.

1107
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,625
I've said everything I had to.
I have an online meeting now.

1108
00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:46,000
Maximum twenty minutes.
Carry on with the discussion.

1109
00:59:46,458 --> 00:59:49,000
- Jolly hasn’t said anything.
- What’s your decision?

1110
00:59:49,166 --> 00:59:51,583
I’m not sure what to say.

1111
00:59:51,625 --> 00:59:53,083
Why not?

1112
00:59:53,291 --> 00:59:54,375
Remember.

1113
00:59:54,458 --> 00:59:57,708
We once had a meeting
like this in Hyderabad

1114
00:59:57,750 --> 01:00:00,791
to remove me from the group.
I had messed up.

1115
01:00:01,583 --> 01:00:03,000
Hari was in the meeting too.

1116
01:00:03,750 --> 01:00:05,458
But you guys didn’t
throw me out that day.

1117
01:00:05,625 --> 01:00:07,583
- You gave me another chance.
- So?

1118
01:00:07,916 --> 01:00:11,208
How can I ask someone who
supported me to leave the group?

1119
01:00:11,708 --> 01:00:12,291
Oh!

1120
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:14,666
Jolly, you just got into a brawl.
This is sexual harassment.

1121
01:00:14,708 --> 01:00:16,666
How can you compare?
He’s talking nonsense.

1122
01:00:16,708 --> 01:00:18,750
- I know that.
- Then what?

1123
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,125
Whatever the group decides,
I am for it.

1124
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:24,458
So, who wants Hari to be expelled?

1125
01:00:25,458 --> 01:00:26,208
Vinay.

1126
01:00:26,416 --> 01:00:29,291
Nandan, Aji, Sudheer

1127
01:00:29,708 --> 01:00:31,333
and me. Total 5.

1128
01:00:31,625 --> 01:00:34,541
Make it 6. I can’t deal
with the police and stuff.

1129
01:00:34,833 --> 01:00:36,583
That makes it 6.
Five left.

1130
01:00:36,708 --> 01:00:39,625
Prasanth and Jolly said they’ll
stand by the group's decision.

1131
01:00:39,708 --> 01:00:41,416
How lame!

1132
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,041
They should have
their own opinion.

1133
01:00:44,875 --> 01:00:47,291
It’s okay. Give them time to think.

1134
01:00:47,833 --> 01:00:51,708
So, order your lunch on Swiggy.

1135
01:00:52,916 --> 01:00:54,583
Come on. Let’s go smoke.

1136
01:00:54,916 --> 01:00:55,750
Hey.

1137
01:00:55,916 --> 01:00:57,125
Call me too.

1138
01:00:57,250 --> 01:00:58,375
We are one when we smoke.

1139
01:01:18,958 --> 01:01:19,791
Dude...

1140
01:01:20,041 --> 01:01:22,583
Cijin and Sanosh
are stupidly stubborn.

1141
01:01:22,666 --> 01:01:23,541
Yeah.

1142
01:01:25,166 --> 01:01:28,666
Madan is putting on a great
act. How did you convince him?

1143
01:01:28,833 --> 01:01:32,791
He knew I couldn’t pull it off.

1144
01:01:34,708 --> 01:01:38,291
Did you see how Santosh
brought up my issue with Hari?

1145
01:01:40,041 --> 01:01:42,041
Does Madan know that I know?

1146
01:01:42,375 --> 01:01:44,208
No, he doesn't! Don’t
give him that impression.

1147
01:01:44,250 --> 01:01:45,250
No, never.

1148
01:01:47,375 --> 01:01:48,208
Come.

1149
01:01:49,541 --> 01:01:50,375
Listen…

1150
01:01:50,416 --> 01:01:52,333
Do they know you
came here yesterday?

1151
01:01:52,458 --> 01:01:54,583
No one will know unless you tell them.

1152
01:02:00,041 --> 01:02:01,291
Prasanth!

1153
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:02,458
Over here.

1154
01:02:02,833 --> 01:02:05,125
- Rice for lunch, alright?
- Yes, with chicken.

1155
01:02:05,541 --> 01:02:06,791
We're screwed anyway.

1156
01:02:06,916 --> 01:02:09,250
Madan won't allow
meat in the house.

1157
01:02:09,333 --> 01:02:12,000
-Where did you get this?
-I always have it stocked up.

1158
01:02:21,666 --> 01:02:23,250
Here's to a truce!

1159
01:02:25,083 --> 01:02:28,583
Don't worry about Madan,
I got it from his secret stash.

1160
01:02:29,166 --> 01:02:31,958
Oh Vodka. So it won't reek.

1161
01:02:36,458 --> 01:02:37,000
Cijin!

1162
01:02:37,208 --> 01:02:38,750
Don't take it to heart.

1163
01:02:38,791 --> 01:02:41,583
I said it in the heat
of the moment. Sorry.

1164
01:02:41,916 --> 01:02:43,208
I'm sorry.

1165
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,083
I was puzzled when you lashed out.

1166
01:02:46,125 --> 01:02:48,958
I’m sorry too. I think
I got on your nerves.

1167
01:02:51,208 --> 01:02:53,625
I heard you talking about
the marriage proposal.

1168
01:02:53,750 --> 01:02:54,916
What you believe is not true.

1169
01:02:54,958 --> 01:02:58,333
Anjali never had a problem with you.

1170
01:02:58,500 --> 01:02:59,416
Then?

1171
01:02:59,416 --> 01:03:04,000
Her cousin sister was seeing
a Muslim guy.

1172
01:03:04,458 --> 01:03:06,500
Since Anjali knew you personally,

1173
01:03:06,583 --> 01:03:09,333
her cousin begged
her to cook up a story,

1174
01:03:09,958 --> 01:03:12,541
so her parents would call it off
themselves.

1175
01:03:12,625 --> 01:03:14,708
Anjali had to finally give in.

1176
01:03:15,708 --> 01:03:17,541
Really?

1177
01:03:17,916 --> 01:03:20,166
Why would I lie?

1178
01:03:20,291 --> 01:03:22,208
Anjali could've told me.

1179
01:03:22,291 --> 01:03:25,375
I did tell her that, but she
was scared.

1180
01:03:25,750 --> 01:03:27,666
He really liked that girl...

1181
01:03:27,750 --> 01:03:30,333
and back then he was
he was new to the group.

1182
01:03:30,666 --> 01:03:34,125
She wasn't sure how he’d react.

1183
01:03:34,250 --> 01:03:37,750
So all that led to the
lovely family I now have.

1184
01:03:38,166 --> 01:03:39,833
That's the spirit!

1185
01:03:40,041 --> 01:03:42,958
You've taken a load off my mind.

1186
01:03:46,041 --> 01:03:48,333
Santhosh, isn't Neha
in the 9th grade now?

1187
01:03:48,375 --> 01:03:51,416
No. She's in the 11th grade.

1188
01:03:51,750 --> 01:03:53,875
If Hari had done this to Neha,

1189
01:03:53,958 --> 01:03:58,750
would you suspend him for six
months and take him back again?

1190
01:04:01,375 --> 01:04:02,958
Would you?

1191
01:04:07,916 --> 01:04:10,125
Hello. Laurels Cottage?

1192
01:04:11,791 --> 01:04:13,250
Am I speaking to Maria?

1193
01:04:14,750 --> 01:04:17,833
Thirteen of us stayed
there last Sunday.

1194
01:04:17,916 --> 01:04:19,916
Yes. That's right.

1195
01:04:20,583 --> 01:04:25,375
I forgot my watch there by mistake -
on the table next to the step.

1196
01:04:25,458 --> 01:04:27,458
Did you find it?

1197
01:04:28,041 --> 01:04:29,541
Oh you didn't?

1198
01:04:29,958 --> 01:04:32,125
It was an expensive watch.

1199
01:04:32,625 --> 01:04:35,416
Oh no! Never
meant you took it.

1200
01:04:36,791 --> 01:04:39,416
Did you have any guests
there this week?

1201
01:04:41,625 --> 01:04:44,708
I see. Do you have CCTV
by any chance?

1202
01:04:47,541 --> 01:04:50,250
I don't have anything
against her, she's really cool.

1203
01:04:50,333 --> 01:04:54,333
But shouldn't we ask him before
making such an important decision?

1204
01:04:54,458 --> 01:04:55,500
That's just my point.

1205
01:04:55,583 --> 01:04:58,958
All right! What will happen
if you asked him?

1206
01:04:59,625 --> 01:05:00,833
I have no idea.

1207
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
He will never accept it.

1208
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:06,333
Then Anjali will be forced
to take legal action.

1209
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:10,625
The news spreads and
our group will suffer.

1210
01:05:10,666 --> 01:05:12,750
If we expel him, won't he
make it into an issue?

1211
01:05:12,875 --> 01:05:15,833
Never! It will put an end
to his movie career.

1212
01:05:16,333 --> 01:05:18,083
He keeps quiet, we keep quiet.

1213
01:05:18,125 --> 01:05:21,500
If this ever leaks out, world
should only know one thing.

1214
01:05:21,750 --> 01:05:26,916
We expelled him as soon as
we knew about it.

1215
01:05:27,208 --> 01:05:28,875
That’s what is best for the group.

1216
01:05:29,125 --> 01:05:32,541
Think about it! You need to
think about the group as well.

1217
01:05:35,166 --> 01:05:36,916
“Respected Sir,

1218
01:05:37,041 --> 01:05:39,375
“As you know, after our play
this past Sunday,

1219
01:05:39,416 --> 01:05:43,000
“we actors had a party at
the cottage in Fort Kochi.

1220
01:05:43,041 --> 01:05:46,041
“Yesterday Anjali complained
to Madan,

1221
01:05:46,208 --> 01:05:47,208
“the group coordinator,

1222
01:05:47,250 --> 01:05:50,083
“that Hari sexually assaulted
her that night.

1223
01:05:50,166 --> 01:05:52,541
“The complaint was that Hari groped
Anjali's breast

1224
01:05:52,666 --> 01:05:54,916
“while she was sleeping near
the window.

1225
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,583
“In a meeting held here today
with the other members,

1226
01:05:57,625 --> 01:06:00,041
“it has been confirmed
that the complaint is true.

1227
01:06:00,125 --> 01:06:02,583
“Sir, this is a serious case
of sexual harassment

1228
01:06:02,625 --> 01:06:05,291
“which could destroy the
very foundation of our group.

1229
01:06:05,458 --> 01:06:08,500
“Therefore, we request you
as director

1230
01:06:08,583 --> 01:06:12,000
“to immediately expel
Hari from the group.”

1231
01:06:12,083 --> 01:06:15,875
“Sir, Everyone will sign this letter
with full conviction

1232
01:06:15,916 --> 01:06:18,791
“that you will stand by us
in this decision.

1233
01:06:19,291 --> 01:06:20,791
“Yours sincerely…”

1234
01:06:20,916 --> 01:06:22,500
Sounds good.

1235
01:06:22,625 --> 01:06:24,333
That's why I made
him read it out.

1236
01:06:24,416 --> 01:06:26,041
Isn’t this enough?

1237
01:06:26,166 --> 01:06:28,708
Yes. We will tell sir personally anyway.

1238
01:06:29,125 --> 01:06:32,125
Give the letter only after
you’ve spoken to sir directly.

1239
01:06:32,250 --> 01:06:35,291
This is just a formality.
Nothing more.

1240
01:06:35,583 --> 01:06:37,166
I have signed.

1241
01:07:03,250 --> 01:07:05,500
Gotta see Hari after all this!

1242
01:07:06,458 --> 01:07:07,458
Filthy dog!

1243
01:07:09,625 --> 01:07:13,083
Personally I don't agree with this.

1244
01:07:14,708 --> 01:07:18,125
But I don't want to cause
trouble for the group.

1245
01:07:22,875 --> 01:07:25,125
Another friendship comes
to an end.

1246
01:07:36,416 --> 01:07:38,916
You have heard the letter once.

1247
01:07:40,291 --> 01:07:42,833
I don't mind signing it.
This is for sir, right?

1248
01:07:42,875 --> 01:07:43,416
Yes.

1249
01:07:44,375 --> 01:07:46,875
-Shouldn't we inform Anjali about this?
-Yes.

1250
01:07:46,916 --> 01:07:49,541
Madan will let her know
once we’re done.

1251
01:07:51,458 --> 01:07:52,875
That's not enough, Madan.

1252
01:07:53,041 --> 01:07:56,833
She should only know that
this decision was unanimous.

1253
01:07:56,916 --> 01:08:00,083
So we feel that we should
call her here and tell her directly.

1254
01:08:00,291 --> 01:08:02,791
By “we” do you mean the two of you?

1255
01:08:02,833 --> 01:08:05,916
Sanosh, Cijin, Selvan and I
are of the same opinion.

1256
01:08:06,541 --> 01:08:07,500
Okay!

1257
01:08:07,666 --> 01:08:11,125
Santhosh, we'll let her know.
But why bring her here?

1258
01:08:11,166 --> 01:08:13,041
That's not how it is, Vinay.

1259
01:08:13,125 --> 01:08:17,541
Initially, a few of us had different
views about this matter.

1260
01:08:18,333 --> 01:08:22,333
That’s part of a discussion
and she shouldn't know that.

1261
01:08:22,666 --> 01:08:25,791
She should know that we
made this decision together.

1262
01:08:26,083 --> 01:08:29,375
Why create heroes and villains?

1263
01:08:29,375 --> 01:08:30,208
That's not needed.

1264
01:08:30,625 --> 01:08:33,500
Come on! She's never going to
know what we discussed here.

1265
01:08:33,541 --> 01:08:36,375
- Don't make egoistical decisions!
- You can't say that.

1266
01:08:37,041 --> 01:08:38,625
What about the Jolly incident?

1267
01:08:38,666 --> 01:08:42,500
Madan, Sudheer and Hari were
the saints who forgave him.

1268
01:08:42,833 --> 01:08:45,250
And we became the
bad guys. Ask him.

1269
01:08:45,333 --> 01:08:46,250
Jolly won't deny it.

1270
01:08:46,375 --> 01:08:48,875
Whatever! It is not right
to call Anjali here.

1271
01:08:48,875 --> 01:08:51,041
-Why not?
-She'll have a hard time facing us.

1272
01:08:51,250 --> 01:08:53,166
Same for us as well.

1273
01:08:53,291 --> 01:08:55,875
What is there to explain anyway?

1274
01:08:55,916 --> 01:08:58,875
Cijin, just sign it if you care.

1275
01:09:00,333 --> 01:09:04,416
Anyway, don't even think of
calling Anjali here.

1276
01:09:04,750 --> 01:09:06,750
You don't decide that.

1277
01:09:08,250 --> 01:09:12,000
Santhosh said: "'Selvan'
is of the same opinion".

1278
01:09:12,291 --> 01:09:13,833
I am Selvan.

1279
01:09:13,833 --> 01:09:15,750
I asked them to call her here.

1280
01:09:15,875 --> 01:09:17,791
Only if she is okay with it.

1281
01:09:18,250 --> 01:09:20,250
I'll call her.

1282
01:09:22,125 --> 01:09:24,666
All right. Do whatever you want!

1283
01:09:24,791 --> 01:09:25,875
Sudheer!

1284
01:09:25,916 --> 01:09:27,625
Stop there, Sudheer!

1285
01:09:28,083 --> 01:09:30,375
First comes Sir, then me, then Aji.

1286
01:09:30,541 --> 01:09:32,541
Know where you stand!

1287
01:09:32,875 --> 01:09:35,708
See this! It's fully dyed!

1288
01:09:35,958 --> 01:09:39,375
Don't force me to prove my seniority.

1289
01:09:41,750 --> 01:09:44,833
She'll take my call. I'm sure.

1290
01:09:46,583 --> 01:09:50,250
Call her only if she'll be
relieved to see all of us.

1291
01:09:50,458 --> 01:09:51,500
Of course, Aji.

1292
01:09:51,791 --> 01:09:54,250
Only if she is
comfortable coming.

1293
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,458
Let me call her.

1294
01:09:59,375 --> 01:10:02,625
I’ll put it on the speaker,
so everyone can hear it.

1295
01:10:13,458 --> 01:10:14,291
Hello.

1296
01:10:14,625 --> 01:10:16,958
-Selvan?
-Yes, it’s me, dear.

1297
01:10:17,416 --> 01:10:19,250
Madan has told us everything.

1298
01:10:19,541 --> 01:10:23,083
We have all made a
decision on that matter.

1299
01:10:23,375 --> 01:10:27,291
We want to tell you of
our decision in person.

1300
01:10:27,291 --> 01:10:30,333
Can you please come here?
To Madan's house.

1301
01:10:30,375 --> 01:10:32,500
I’ll be there. No problem.

1302
01:10:32,625 --> 01:10:35,750
Hope you don't mind coming?-No, no. I'll be there.

1303
01:10:35,791 --> 01:10:37,875
I'm at a friend's house in Thevara.

1304
01:10:38,041 --> 01:10:39,875
I’ll be there in an hour and a half.

1305
01:10:39,958 --> 01:10:41,833
Okay, Okay.

1306
01:10:41,958 --> 01:10:43,958
At Madan's house.-Okay.

1307
01:10:44,833 --> 01:10:45,666
Okay.

1308
01:10:46,666 --> 01:10:48,208
So that's sorted!

1309
01:10:48,333 --> 01:10:50,208
Now let's eat.

1310
01:10:54,666 --> 01:10:57,750
Under these circumstances asking
her to come alone isn’t right.

1311
01:11:00,708 --> 01:11:03,625
Vinay, can you go and pick her up?

1312
01:11:03,958 --> 01:11:05,625
You can take my car.

1313
01:11:07,041 --> 01:11:08,541
I'll go.

1314
01:11:08,875 --> 01:11:10,958
No problem.

1315
01:11:12,791 --> 01:11:15,208
Don't answer their calls again!

1316
01:11:15,250 --> 01:11:18,041
I messaged you on WhatsApp
and kept waiting for your response.

1317
01:11:18,083 --> 01:11:20,291
I just saw the message, Vinay.

1318
01:11:21,583 --> 01:11:23,458
My phone was in Serah's room.

1319
01:11:30,125 --> 01:11:32,541
- That's enough!
-Yeah, I'm done.

1320
01:11:32,958 --> 01:11:35,833
Who'll play Vinay's role when
Vinay plays Hari's role in Delhi?

1321
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,541
Hey. Yes, darling?

1322
01:11:39,416 --> 01:11:41,333
I'll be a bit late.

1323
01:11:42,041 --> 01:11:44,000
We'll have to hire more actors.

1324
01:11:44,791 --> 01:11:46,458
Remember Sharath? He is good.

1325
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:48,625
Sanosh! Bring my phone here!

1326
01:11:52,625 --> 01:11:54,500
Madan, it's Hari.

1327
01:11:55,875 --> 01:11:57,333
Call you later.

1328
01:11:58,166 --> 01:11:59,458
Bring it here.

1329
01:12:03,416 --> 01:12:04,958
Put it on speaker.

1330
01:12:06,458 --> 01:12:09,208
- Hey brother!
- Yes?

1331
01:12:09,458 --> 01:12:13,000
I've got helluva news for you.
Life changing news.

1332
01:12:13,375 --> 01:12:16,208
Spit it out!- Not on the phone!

1333
01:12:16,583 --> 01:12:18,333
-Are you at home?
-Yes!

1334
01:12:18,416 --> 01:12:21,166
I’m at Aluva. Give me 10 minutes.
I'll be there.

1335
01:12:22,458 --> 01:12:24,500
I’m about to go out.

1336
01:12:24,625 --> 01:12:26,291
I have to meet someone.

1337
01:12:27,041 --> 01:12:28,833
Can we talk on the phone?

1338
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,083
I'm in a hurry too.

1339
01:12:30,166 --> 01:12:32,708
I’m on my way
to a movie location.

1340
01:12:32,708 --> 01:12:34,416
You'll be shocked
if you hear about it.

1341
01:12:34,458 --> 01:12:36,000
Hang on for 10 minutes.

1342
01:12:38,541 --> 01:12:40,000
What? What's he talking about?

1343
01:12:40,083 --> 01:12:41,166
Who knows?

1344
01:12:41,208 --> 01:12:43,125
-Is he coming here?
-You heard him!

1345
01:12:43,291 --> 01:12:47,791
- Why did you call him here?
- He called. Not me.

1346
01:12:47,958 --> 01:12:49,083
Stop arguing!

1347
01:12:49,125 --> 01:12:51,166
Our plans will go awry if he comes now.

1348
01:12:51,208 --> 01:12:53,375
Do something quickly!
Take all of this away.

1349
01:12:53,791 --> 01:12:57,791
He said ten minutes, right? Let's hide
our shoes and our bikes.

1350
01:12:57,833 --> 01:12:59,208
Be quick!

1351
01:12:59,333 --> 01:13:02,958
- Keep everything behind the house.
- Let's hide in that room.

1352
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,583
Not in that room. What if
he wants to use the toilet?

1353
01:13:05,708 --> 01:13:07,791
Let's go upstairs.

1354
01:13:09,041 --> 01:13:11,333
All of you stay in
the room, upstairs.

1355
01:13:11,416 --> 01:13:14,625
Where are you running to?
Help me with the chairs.

1356
01:13:17,458 --> 01:13:19,500
Why hide? Why not ride away
on our bikes?

1357
01:13:19,583 --> 01:13:21,208
Nine people in three bikes?

1358
01:13:21,333 --> 01:13:23,208
Come on, let's triple ride!

1359
01:13:23,291 --> 01:13:27,000
We don't know which way he'll come.
We might run into him.

1360
01:13:38,833 --> 01:13:41,500
-Jolly, is this Vinay's?
-Yeah! Bring that too.

1361
01:13:44,916 --> 01:13:46,791
Take away that glass.

1362
01:13:47,208 --> 01:13:48,458
Shit. It's locked!

1363
01:13:48,541 --> 01:13:50,916
Jolly, come here,
we'll have to lift it. Cijin!

1364
01:13:52,208 --> 01:13:53,541
Come on, fast.

1365
01:14:01,833 --> 01:14:03,791
Put your phones on silent.

1366
01:14:15,416 --> 01:14:18,500
"The Bluetooth device is
connected successfully"

1367
01:14:24,083 --> 01:14:26,291
Your lucky day!

1368
01:14:29,041 --> 01:14:31,166
-Thank me first.
-What is it?

1369
01:14:31,541 --> 01:14:34,041
Hold your horses and first say thanks.

1370
01:14:34,250 --> 01:14:36,375
Alright... Thanks. Tell me now.

1371
01:14:36,625 --> 01:14:38,083
Come.

1372
01:14:38,333 --> 01:14:39,833
Have you got a passport?

1373
01:14:42,833 --> 01:14:44,791
Tell me if you have a passport.

1374
01:14:44,791 --> 01:14:45,958
Yes... why?

1375
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:48,208
In that case...

1376
01:14:48,458 --> 01:14:51,083
get ready for a three-month
trip to Europe.

1377
01:14:51,291 --> 01:14:53,500
Not just you. We’re all going.

1378
01:14:53,791 --> 01:14:57,708
Our play is soon going international.

1379
01:14:58,250 --> 01:14:59,583
Are you drunk?

1380
01:15:02,291 --> 01:15:04,291
You think I'm drunk?

1381
01:15:06,750 --> 01:15:08,583
I'm sober as a judge.

1382
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:10,375
But...

1383
01:15:10,666 --> 01:15:11,666
I'll drink...

1384
01:15:13,666 --> 01:15:15,125
tomorrow night.

1385
01:15:15,375 --> 01:15:18,250
We'll all have a party!

1386
01:15:20,541 --> 01:15:22,041
I don't understand.

1387
01:15:23,208 --> 01:15:24,958
You didn't get me?

1388
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:28,083
It's something I've been
trying for a long time.

1389
01:15:28,708 --> 01:15:30,291
Remember those foreigners?

1390
01:15:30,458 --> 01:15:32,125
Chris and Emily!

1391
01:15:32,166 --> 01:15:35,375
They were so impressed with our play.

1392
01:15:35,416 --> 01:15:38,208
They called me up this morning
and said they have a surprise.

1393
01:15:38,250 --> 01:15:41,000
I went to see them.
This was their offer:

1394
01:15:41,625 --> 01:15:45,166
Next January, February, March...

1395
01:15:45,291 --> 01:15:48,750
They are taking our
team for a trip to England.

1396
01:15:50,166 --> 01:15:51,875
Stunned, right?

1397
01:15:52,208 --> 01:15:56,750
Eighteen shows in three months.
That means six shows a month.

1398
01:15:58,083 --> 01:16:00,083
Not just England...

1399
01:16:00,333 --> 01:16:02,583
Finland, Denmark...

1400
01:16:02,916 --> 01:16:03,791
Norway.

1401
01:16:03,833 --> 01:16:05,416
And maybe France.

1402
01:16:06,208 --> 01:16:09,333
Three months make ninety days.

1403
01:16:09,625 --> 01:16:12,666
Say the play takes 18 days,
we'll still have 72 days left.

1404
01:16:12,750 --> 01:16:13,958
In those seventy-two days,

1405
01:16:13,958 --> 01:16:17,000
We’ll have the greatest time
we’ve ever had.

1406
01:16:17,250 --> 01:16:18,583
The best part is,

1407
01:16:18,791 --> 01:16:20,708
We’ll all be paid well.

1408
01:16:20,833 --> 01:16:24,125
Not a couple of thousands. But
800 thousand Rupees per head.

1409
01:16:24,416 --> 01:16:26,041
And 1.5 million Rupees for Sir.

1410
01:16:26,041 --> 01:16:28,291
Fortune is smiling on us all.

1411
01:16:28,458 --> 01:16:31,000
-Are they really serious?
-Come on, man!

1412
01:16:31,083 --> 01:16:34,541
They even showed me the
British government's invitation letter.

1413
01:16:36,583 --> 01:16:37,416
One minute.

1414
01:16:41,666 --> 01:16:44,500
Oh no! It's Deepak. The controller

1415
01:16:45,125 --> 01:16:46,500
Give me a moment.

1416
01:16:46,666 --> 01:16:47,708
Yes, Deepak..

1417
01:16:47,833 --> 01:16:51,833
I'll be right there.
I'll apologise to him.

1418
01:16:54,625 --> 01:16:57,750
My co-star is waiting.
Let him wait, right?

1419
01:16:59,791 --> 01:17:01,916
Aren’t you happy with my news?

1420
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,833
I am... I'm stunned.

1421
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:07,375
We'll get to perform at
the London National Theatre.

1422
01:17:07,458 --> 01:17:10,916
-We'll be in London for eight days.
-This is quite something.

1423
01:17:11,041 --> 01:17:12,208
Did you inform Sir?

1424
01:17:12,291 --> 01:17:14,750
No. I spoke to him over phone
but didn't mention it.

1425
01:17:14,833 --> 01:17:16,750
I prefer to tell him in person.

1426
01:17:16,833 --> 01:17:19,666
-He's flying to Nepal tomorrow.
-I know. That's why I came.

1427
01:17:19,750 --> 01:17:23,708
I'll see him tonight.
You should come with me.

1428
01:17:23,791 --> 01:17:24,458
Sure.

1429
01:17:24,750 --> 01:17:26,250
January?

1430
01:17:26,416 --> 01:17:28,375
January will be here in a blink.

1431
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:31,291
But only Prasanth and
I have the passport.

1432
01:17:31,291 --> 01:17:32,375
That's no problem.

1433
01:17:32,416 --> 01:17:35,250
It takes less than a month to get one.

1434
01:17:35,333 --> 01:17:37,500
-Don't tell the others about this.
-No, no.

1435
01:17:37,625 --> 01:17:40,625
Let Sir tell everyone.
That's how it should be.

1436
01:17:41,166 --> 01:17:44,875
I came to you because I couldn't
contain my excitement.

1437
01:17:45,125 --> 01:17:46,208
Deepak is calling.

1438
01:17:46,250 --> 01:17:49,000
Forget it. He's just checking
in with me. Let's go.

1439
01:17:49,208 --> 01:17:50,500
I'm leaving now.

1440
01:17:50,541 --> 01:17:52,583
Oops! Forgot my phone.

1441
01:17:53,833 --> 01:17:58,500
I'll give you a call around 8 p.m. OK?

1442
01:17:58,708 --> 01:18:05,833
Meet me at Oberon Mall.
We'll go to Sir's place together.

1443
01:18:08,333 --> 01:18:10,375
-Wait a minute.
-Yes?

1444
01:18:11,291 --> 01:18:14,083
Three months of travel means…

1445
01:18:14,125 --> 01:18:16,458
-Does it include Anjali?
-Come on, man!

1446
01:18:16,541 --> 01:18:18,541
She's our one and only heroine!

1447
01:18:19,041 --> 01:18:22,458
My wife might come too.
Not sure yet.

1448
01:18:22,708 --> 01:18:24,416
Anjali will get some company.

1449
01:18:29,875 --> 01:18:32,458
Look at you!
You look dazed.

1450
01:18:32,708 --> 01:18:34,625
Don't tell anyone for God’s sake.

1451
01:18:34,750 --> 01:18:36,416
Keep it quiet for one more day.

1452
01:18:36,541 --> 01:18:38,541
See you at 8. Let's go.

1453
01:18:46,125 --> 01:18:48,791
Hello, Madan. Hope you're well.

1454
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:52,208
-Wasn’t he the movie star?
-Yes. Hari.

1455
01:18:52,333 --> 01:18:54,250
I didn't know his name.

1456
01:18:54,416 --> 01:18:57,500
So... I'm not asking
for votes from you.

1457
01:18:57,708 --> 01:19:01,750
All I promise is - I'll never spoil
my father’s reputation.

1458
01:19:16,708 --> 01:19:18,291
Why are you all so silent?

1459
01:19:19,041 --> 01:19:20,291
Say something.

1460
01:19:20,583 --> 01:19:22,416
We're not destined for good things.

1461
01:19:24,875 --> 01:19:26,083
Don't say that.

1462
01:19:26,541 --> 01:19:28,291
It's easy to say such things.

1463
01:19:28,833 --> 01:19:31,625
We're trying to kick him out
and he's trying to fly us out!

1464
01:19:35,833 --> 01:19:36,833
Is Anjali here?

1465
01:19:37,166 --> 01:19:38,166
She's inside.

1466
01:19:38,541 --> 01:19:40,041
Sit down. I'll call her.

1467
01:19:40,083 --> 01:19:41,500
No, I'll go in.

1468
01:19:44,916 --> 01:19:46,458
We need time to think.

1469
01:19:46,458 --> 01:19:47,666
Anjali shouldn't come now.

1470
01:19:47,666 --> 01:19:49,958
Madan, call Vinay quickly.

1471
01:19:49,958 --> 01:19:52,541
Stop him, if he hasn't reached.

1472
01:19:52,583 --> 01:19:53,833
- I'll call him.
- Madan...

1473
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,250
They insisted on bringing her here.

1474
01:19:56,250 --> 01:19:57,250
Never mind!

1475
01:20:02,583 --> 01:20:03,625
Where are you?

1476
01:20:05,166 --> 01:20:06,166
What about Anjali?

1477
01:20:08,458 --> 01:20:10,416
Nothing. I just called to see,
if you'd got there.

1478
01:20:11,375 --> 01:20:12,916
How long before you're back?

1479
01:20:14,708 --> 01:20:15,708
Okay.

1480
01:20:16,500 --> 01:20:17,500
Okay.

1481
01:20:17,541 --> 01:20:18,541
What did he say?

1482
01:20:19,416 --> 01:20:20,958
No luck. They've already met.

1483
01:20:20,958 --> 01:20:21,958
Damn it!

1484
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,791
Why did Selvan call me?

1485
01:20:26,291 --> 01:20:28,958
You sound like you're the
wrongdoer.

1486
01:20:30,041 --> 01:20:31,583
Calm down first.

1487
01:20:34,083 --> 01:20:38,291
So why did Selvan... call me?

1488
01:20:39,250 --> 01:20:42,375
I didn't tell you, because
you were with Serah.

1489
01:20:43,125 --> 01:20:45,708
We've decided to kick that
asshole out of the group.

1490
01:20:46,208 --> 01:20:48,083
They want to tell you in person.

1491
01:20:48,500 --> 01:20:51,208
They want to convince you
that they're all on your side.

1492
01:20:52,166 --> 01:20:53,250
Simple as that.

1493
01:20:56,583 --> 01:20:57,916
Shouldn't we think it through?

1494
01:20:58,333 --> 01:20:59,708
Aji, shouldn't we think it through?

1495
01:20:59,708 --> 01:21:01,375
Let's go outside and think.

1496
01:21:01,375 --> 01:21:03,125
We'll have a smoke too. Come.

1497
01:21:03,125 --> 01:21:04,291
Come on!

1498
01:21:04,333 --> 01:21:05,708
Prashanth. Come on.

1499
01:21:05,750 --> 01:21:07,333
Sudheer! One minute.

1500
01:21:07,833 --> 01:21:08,833
Come here.

1501
01:21:09,125 --> 01:21:11,250
So when Madan brought it up,

1502
01:21:11,875 --> 01:21:14,916
I stood there like I'd heard it
for the first time.

1503
01:21:16,041 --> 01:21:17,166
I didn't get you.

1504
01:21:17,750 --> 01:21:20,500
Just pretend that you didn't
tell me anything.

1505
01:21:20,708 --> 01:21:22,416
You told Madan.

1506
01:21:22,458 --> 01:21:23,458
That's it.

1507
01:21:24,666 --> 01:21:26,500
Vinay, why are you doing this?

1508
01:21:26,541 --> 01:21:28,333
It's you I talked to.

1509
01:21:29,250 --> 01:21:30,500
That's right.

1510
01:21:30,583 --> 01:21:32,625
But after some thought,

1511
01:21:32,666 --> 01:21:35,000
I believed it was better that
I don't get directly involved.

1512
01:21:39,833 --> 01:21:41,791
I'm not sure about it.

1513
01:21:41,875 --> 01:21:43,000
I have a doubt.

1514
01:21:43,416 --> 01:21:45,000
Take a look at this photo.

1515
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,875
- Recognise the person?
- Yeah.

1516
01:21:47,875 --> 01:21:49,041
Look at the time.

1517
01:21:52,750 --> 01:21:54,041
How can that be?

1518
01:21:55,750 --> 01:21:56,750
Listen...

1519
01:21:57,083 --> 01:22:00,375
No woman would ever lie
about something like this.

1520
01:22:01,041 --> 01:22:03,166
Don't try to act the detective!

1521
01:22:04,250 --> 01:22:05,250
Got it?

1522
01:22:06,291 --> 01:22:08,166
Such ridiculous findings!

1523
01:22:11,625 --> 01:22:13,125
- Hello.
- Hello.

1524
01:22:13,166 --> 01:22:15,791
Hello. Hello. Sudheer sir?

1525
01:22:16,041 --> 01:22:17,666
Why is it connected to that?

1526
01:22:18,208 --> 01:22:19,333
Hold on!

1527
01:22:19,375 --> 01:22:20,791
Yes, I can hear you!

1528
01:22:21,708 --> 01:22:23,166
Can you disconnect it?

1529
01:22:23,166 --> 01:22:25,666
I can hear you...

1530
01:22:27,291 --> 01:22:29,041
Yeah. Tell me.

1531
01:22:30,500 --> 01:22:35,000
You said you gave it some thought
and decided to not get involved.

1532
01:22:36,375 --> 01:22:37,875
What were those thoughts?

1533
01:22:41,208 --> 01:22:42,583
I was thinking about us.

1534
01:22:43,208 --> 01:22:44,958
I didn't want you to know.

1535
01:22:45,166 --> 01:22:48,791
Cijin, Santhosh and Sudheer
suspect our relationship.

1536
01:22:48,916 --> 01:22:51,416
I felt it from the way they spoke.

1537
01:22:51,833 --> 01:22:54,833
What's wrong if they find out
about us?

1538
01:22:55,958 --> 01:22:57,333
It would be awesome!

1539
01:23:00,958 --> 01:23:02,833
If they come to know.

1540
01:23:02,875 --> 01:23:07,333
They'll say, this was a plot you and
I made to kick Hari out of this group.

1541
01:23:08,166 --> 01:23:10,333
Not just now,

1542
01:23:10,375 --> 01:23:13,041
But, we dated for four years
before you got married.

1543
01:23:13,166 --> 01:23:15,666
Even then, you didn't want
anyone to know about us.

1544
01:23:16,041 --> 01:23:17,916
Why are you bringing that up now?

1545
01:23:17,916 --> 01:23:20,041
We've never spoken about it.

1546
01:23:20,083 --> 01:23:22,083
I doubt we ever will.

1547
01:23:22,333 --> 01:23:25,125
You've never been
sure of me, right?

1548
01:23:29,500 --> 01:23:33,291
Anjali, let me get done
with my divorce first.

1549
01:23:33,375 --> 01:23:35,166
Then I promise we'll tell
everyone.

1550
01:23:35,208 --> 01:23:36,208
Will that do?

1551
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:38,000
Will that do?

1552
01:23:38,083 --> 01:23:39,083
Yeah.

1553
01:23:45,750 --> 01:23:47,875
I'm going to say something.

1554
01:23:47,875 --> 01:23:49,625
I'll admit it's terrible.

1555
01:23:50,125 --> 01:23:52,541
An opportunity like this won't
come our way again.

1556
01:23:52,541 --> 01:23:53,750
Think about it.

1557
01:23:53,791 --> 01:23:55,500
Should we forget it for an
issue like this?

1558
01:23:55,541 --> 01:23:57,875
We're not chameleons, are we?

1559
01:23:58,750 --> 01:24:01,750
Not long ago you all signed to
expel him, right?

1560
01:24:01,750 --> 01:24:03,416
I told you to think it through.

1561
01:24:03,416 --> 01:24:06,791
The letter to Sir is still
on the table.

1562
01:24:07,083 --> 01:24:08,291
We haven't sent it yet.

1563
01:24:08,333 --> 01:24:09,666
This is God's plan.

1564
01:24:09,666 --> 01:24:12,208
That the foreigners would
make us this offer,

1565
01:24:12,208 --> 01:24:15,208
and that Hari would tell Madan today.

1566
01:24:15,208 --> 01:24:17,458
It's God's will!

1567
01:24:17,500 --> 01:24:20,083
There was something wrong
with our decision.

1568
01:24:20,083 --> 01:24:23,583
For over ten years we've
worked in the theatre,

1569
01:24:23,625 --> 01:24:26,125
have we ever visited anywhere nice?

1570
01:24:26,166 --> 01:24:28,250
Once in a blue moon we go to
Delhi or Hyderabad.

1571
01:24:28,291 --> 01:24:31,583
This is a 90-day trip across
five countries, dammit.

1572
01:24:31,583 --> 01:24:35,166
Forget the places.
How much is each paid?

1573
01:24:35,208 --> 01:24:36,666
- Six?
- Eight.

1574
01:24:37,375 --> 01:24:39,375
800 thousand Rupees!

1575
01:24:39,375 --> 01:24:42,000
That's beyond our wildest dreams.

1576
01:24:42,041 --> 01:24:47,250
I hardly earn a few hundred a day.

1577
01:24:47,416 --> 01:24:48,583
With this kind of money,

1578
01:24:48,625 --> 01:24:50,916
I could build a small house...

1579
01:24:51,750 --> 01:24:53,458
and get married and be
free of debt.

1580
01:24:53,541 --> 01:24:56,458
800,000 rupees is a
fortune for us.

1581
01:24:56,500 --> 01:24:58,125
I'm not the only one.

1582
01:24:58,166 --> 01:25:00,083
Aji, how much do you earn a day?

1583
01:25:00,083 --> 01:25:01,875
Jolly, why take a census now?

1584
01:25:01,916 --> 01:25:03,083
No, let him talk.

1585
01:25:03,166 --> 01:25:04,333
Aji! Tell us.

1586
01:25:04,333 --> 01:25:06,125
What do you expect from
a fuel station?

1587
01:25:06,125 --> 01:25:07,458
8,000 rupees max.

1588
01:25:07,500 --> 01:25:08,708
Just eight thousand!

1589
01:25:08,833 --> 01:25:10,625
- What about you?
- Twelve.

1590
01:25:10,750 --> 01:25:12,250
Your wife is pregnant, right?

1591
01:25:12,291 --> 01:25:14,041
A baby will soon arrive.

1592
01:25:14,500 --> 01:25:16,416
Sanosh, what about you?

1593
01:25:16,625 --> 01:25:18,791
We're all in the same boat!

1594
01:25:18,833 --> 01:25:20,416
We all need money.

1595
01:25:20,458 --> 01:25:21,916
Stop digging into it!

1596
01:25:21,958 --> 01:25:23,833
You're not like us!

1597
01:25:23,875 --> 01:25:25,791
You own a travel agency.

1598
01:25:25,791 --> 01:25:27,416
Travel agency, my foot!

1599
01:25:28,166 --> 01:25:30,583
I have a debt of 1.4 million
rupees!

1600
01:25:30,916 --> 01:25:33,500
I don't even earn half your income.

1601
01:25:33,500 --> 01:25:37,291
Lost my office because I
couldn't pay back the lenders.

1602
01:25:37,333 --> 01:25:40,708
So don't lecture me about money.

1603
01:25:40,750 --> 01:25:42,208
They'll be here soon.

1604
01:25:42,250 --> 01:25:45,375
Decide what we're going to
tell her.

1605
01:25:45,416 --> 01:25:48,500
We have no other
option but to expel him.

1606
01:25:48,541 --> 01:25:52,000
Brother... this can
change our lives forever.

1607
01:25:52,041 --> 01:25:54,000
Why should we suffer if he groped her?

1608
01:25:54,041 --> 01:25:56,708
If we don't fire him,
Anjali will sue him.

1609
01:25:56,708 --> 01:25:58,958
He'll be arrested and we'll
all be in a mess.

1610
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:02,875
If that happens, do you think
they'll still take us to England?

1611
01:26:02,916 --> 01:26:04,750
Use your head!

1612
01:26:05,375 --> 01:26:06,625
Look at this!

1613
01:26:07,083 --> 01:26:08,500
This is a cheque Hari gave me.

1614
01:26:08,541 --> 01:26:09,583
150,000 rupees!

1615
01:26:09,625 --> 01:26:12,708
I tore it up before signing
that letter.

1616
01:26:12,750 --> 01:26:14,708
You almost had that money.

1617
01:26:14,708 --> 01:26:16,875
Why tear it up in such a hurry?

1618
01:26:16,916 --> 01:26:17,958
You know why!

1619
01:26:17,958 --> 01:26:20,750
I can't take his money and
stab him in the back.

1620
01:26:20,791 --> 01:26:23,541
Yeah! Well, now suffer.

1621
01:26:23,541 --> 01:26:26,000
Say the cheque got torn and
he'll write you another.

1622
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:27,666
That's not a problem.

1623
01:26:27,708 --> 01:26:29,416
Come back to the matter at hand.

1624
01:26:29,458 --> 01:26:32,125
There's only one solution –
compromise.

1625
01:26:32,125 --> 01:26:33,958
We need them both.

1626
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:37,458
Sudheer might say I'm naive.

1627
01:26:38,291 --> 01:26:42,166
There's no doubt that
this is a great opportunity.

1628
01:26:42,625 --> 01:26:46,000
London's National Theatre is a
prestigious place

1629
01:26:46,041 --> 01:26:47,666
to perform.

1630
01:26:48,083 --> 01:26:51,041
And countries like Denmark
and Norway

1631
01:26:51,083 --> 01:26:53,041
are extremely beautiful.

1632
01:26:53,083 --> 01:26:55,041
- Must-see places.
- Needless to say!

1633
01:26:55,083 --> 01:26:56,875
I don't blame you,

1634
01:26:56,875 --> 01:27:00,625
if you've changed your mind
about Anjali now.

1635
01:27:00,958 --> 01:27:04,000
Stop saying 'you'!
Start saying 'we'!

1636
01:27:04,041 --> 01:27:06,208
Let's tell her about the trip.

1637
01:27:06,250 --> 01:27:08,708
What if she changes her mind?

1638
01:27:08,708 --> 01:27:10,625
She'll blow your head off!

1639
01:27:10,666 --> 01:27:12,416
- Santhosh!
- Yes?

1640
01:27:12,416 --> 01:27:14,791
Can we find a compromise?

1641
01:27:15,166 --> 01:27:17,166
It's possible.

1642
01:27:17,208 --> 01:27:19,166
What he did was
definitely wrong.

1643
01:27:19,208 --> 01:27:22,333
But the way she dresses isn't right either.

1644
01:27:22,333 --> 01:27:24,166
I've told her that many times.

1645
01:27:24,208 --> 01:27:26,208
She says I'm regressive.

1646
01:27:27,208 --> 01:27:28,208
Listen.

1647
01:27:28,666 --> 01:27:30,208
I have a plan.

1648
01:27:30,958 --> 01:27:34,541
We must tell Anjali that
we're going to fire Hari.

1649
01:27:34,583 --> 01:27:36,416
But Sir should
not know about it.

1650
01:27:36,416 --> 01:27:39,708
Don't show him our letter either.

1651
01:27:39,750 --> 01:27:43,916
Madan and Hari should go
and see Sir tonight.

1652
01:27:43,916 --> 01:27:47,541
The three of you should then
meet the foreigners

1653
01:27:47,541 --> 01:27:49,583
and make things official.

1654
01:27:50,250 --> 01:27:53,250
After that, Madan has
to do one more thing,

1655
01:27:53,291 --> 01:27:54,708
put a story in the newspaper

1656
01:27:54,750 --> 01:27:57,000
saying our Arangu group is going on

1657
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:58,583
an international trip.

1658
01:27:58,625 --> 01:28:00,916
Include the foreigners'
names as well.

1659
01:28:00,958 --> 01:28:03,583
Then that becomes public news.

1660
01:28:03,666 --> 01:28:07,166
Only then should Sir know about
the Anjali-Hari issue.

1661
01:28:07,208 --> 01:28:09,458
It should look like she came
to us for help,

1662
01:28:09,458 --> 01:28:11,750
and we had no choice,

1663
01:28:11,791 --> 01:28:13,875
but to exclude Hari from
the trip.

1664
01:28:14,416 --> 01:28:15,625
Got it?

1665
01:28:16,166 --> 01:28:17,333
No.

1666
01:28:18,333 --> 01:28:20,000
Come on, Madan.

1667
01:28:20,041 --> 01:28:22,333
We came to know of it today.

1668
01:28:22,333 --> 01:28:24,125
Assume we never came to know.

1669
01:28:24,166 --> 01:28:27,500
What if Anjali had told you
this next week?

1670
01:28:28,291 --> 01:28:30,416
If this plan works,

1671
01:28:30,416 --> 01:28:31,583
Aji...

1672
01:28:31,625 --> 01:28:35,541
we get to go on the trip and
kick Hari out as well.

1673
01:28:35,583 --> 01:28:37,833
Only he can be so crooked.

1674
01:28:37,875 --> 01:28:39,833
Nandan, your idea is great.

1675
01:28:39,875 --> 01:28:42,166
- But it won't work.
- Why not?

1676
01:28:42,208 --> 01:28:45,500
Hari is really close to these foreigners.

1677
01:28:45,541 --> 01:28:49,625
They made this offer
because of their love for him.

1678
01:28:49,625 --> 01:28:52,666
Not because of our play's
greatness.

1679
01:28:52,708 --> 01:28:55,291
They won't take us anywhere
without him.

1680
01:28:55,333 --> 01:28:56,791
One thing is sure,

1681
01:28:56,791 --> 01:28:59,791
having both Anjali and Hari
back is an impossibility.

1682
01:28:59,791 --> 01:29:01,458
If that's ever going to happen,

1683
01:29:01,458 --> 01:29:03,416
Anjali has to forgive Hari first.

1684
01:29:03,416 --> 01:29:05,166
There's only one
way to do that...

1685
01:29:05,208 --> 01:29:06,916
The seniors of our group,

1686
01:29:06,916 --> 01:29:10,541
Aji, Madan, Selvan
and Sudheer...

1687
01:29:10,625 --> 01:29:14,416
the four of you should go to her
and apologise on his behalf.

1688
01:29:14,458 --> 01:29:16,708
Go down on your
knees if you must.

1689
01:29:16,750 --> 01:29:20,250
She'll forgive him because
she has a soft spot for you.

1690
01:29:20,250 --> 01:29:23,458
But don't mention the trip.

1691
01:29:23,458 --> 01:29:26,333
She should know all that as
something that happened later.

1692
01:29:26,375 --> 01:29:27,500
It's worth thinking about.

1693
01:29:27,541 --> 01:29:29,375
There's no time to think!

1694
01:29:29,375 --> 01:29:30,416
They'll be here any minute.

1695
01:29:30,416 --> 01:29:31,500
Let her come.

1696
01:29:31,500 --> 01:29:33,666
I'll talk to her. I don't mind.

1697
01:29:33,666 --> 01:29:35,291
All the seniors should
talk to her.

1698
01:29:35,333 --> 01:29:37,583
Since it's a great opportunity
for the group,

1699
01:29:39,083 --> 01:29:41,000
I'll apologise on behalf of
that rascal.

1700
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,875
I won't apologise on his behalf.

1701
01:29:44,291 --> 01:29:47,083
We have a senior
here, let him do that.

1702
01:29:48,333 --> 01:29:50,208
Aji, what do you think?

1703
01:30:43,208 --> 01:30:45,333
How can I face them?

1704
01:30:46,458 --> 01:30:48,375
I feel uneasy.

1705
01:30:49,458 --> 01:30:52,666
Then why did you agree to
come when Selvan called?

1706
01:30:53,041 --> 01:30:55,416
When he suddenly called,

1707
01:30:56,125 --> 01:30:59,416
how could I say no to such seniors?

1708
01:31:04,333 --> 01:31:06,166
Anjali, I forgot to tell you...

1709
01:31:08,250 --> 01:31:12,208
Yesterday, Madan asked if
you were sure it was Hari.

1710
01:31:12,583 --> 01:31:14,541
And if you'd seen him.

1711
01:31:14,541 --> 01:31:16,750
I said you saw him.

1712
01:31:19,041 --> 01:31:21,375
They're not going
to ask you anything.

1713
01:31:21,583 --> 01:31:25,083
But in case they ask, you should
say you saw him that night.

1714
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:32,000
Stop the car.

1715
01:31:34,458 --> 01:31:36,166
Stop the car, I said.

1716
01:31:48,333 --> 01:31:49,416
What's wrong?

1717
01:31:49,458 --> 01:31:51,458
I cannot lie.

1718
01:31:52,166 --> 01:31:54,666
Why did you say something
like that to Madan?

1719
01:31:55,250 --> 01:31:58,166
I didn't mean to say it, Anjali.

1720
01:31:58,208 --> 01:32:00,666
He asked me clearly:

1721
01:32:00,666 --> 01:32:02,750
"Did she see him or not?"

1722
01:32:02,791 --> 01:32:04,791
I said it on the spur
of the moment.

1723
01:32:05,250 --> 01:32:06,875
He wouldn't have taken it
any further,

1724
01:32:06,875 --> 01:32:09,875
if he thought you had not
seen Hari.

1725
01:32:09,875 --> 01:32:12,833
That's why I told you, Vinay.

1726
01:32:13,291 --> 01:32:15,083
I don't want to tell anyone else.

1727
01:32:15,291 --> 01:32:17,250
I'll just leave the group.

1728
01:32:17,250 --> 01:32:18,833
I don't get it.

1729
01:32:18,875 --> 01:32:23,125
He groped you and you're
leaving the group?

1730
01:32:23,375 --> 01:32:25,375
He should leave the group.

1731
01:32:27,875 --> 01:32:28,708
Vinay,

1732
01:32:28,750 --> 01:32:30,875
if something like this happens
in a place

1733
01:32:30,916 --> 01:32:33,083
we think is the safest-

1734
01:32:33,083 --> 01:32:35,583
it's devastating.

1735
01:32:35,625 --> 01:32:37,625
It's not the same place any more.

1736
01:32:38,291 --> 01:32:40,333
That's why I said I'll leave.

1737
01:32:40,625 --> 01:32:42,375
I understand, Anjali.

1738
01:32:42,416 --> 01:32:43,958
But if that rascal leaves,

1739
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,250
it'll be the same safe
place again.

1740
01:32:46,458 --> 01:32:47,583
Whatever...

1741
01:32:49,375 --> 01:32:53,041
I'm not willing to
lie just to prove it.

1742
01:32:55,250 --> 01:32:56,416
Anjali.

1743
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,750
Did he grope you?

1744
01:33:01,458 --> 01:33:03,375
Don't look at me like that!

1745
01:33:03,416 --> 01:33:05,666
- Did he grope you or not?
- Yes.

1746
01:33:05,666 --> 01:33:08,583
- Did you see him?
- No.

1747
01:33:08,583 --> 01:33:12,458
You only have that crap that
fell from his pocket as proof.

1748
01:33:12,500 --> 01:33:14,166
Not just that.

1749
01:33:15,125 --> 01:33:17,125
I'm sure it was him.

1750
01:33:17,125 --> 01:33:19,125
That same scent.

1751
01:33:20,708 --> 01:33:23,583
Only I'll believe it, Anjali.

1752
01:33:23,583 --> 01:33:26,708
When we present it to the group,
it won't be enough.

1753
01:33:27,625 --> 01:33:29,416
The group is only standing with
us because

1754
01:33:29,458 --> 01:33:31,333
they think you saw him.

1755
01:33:31,375 --> 01:33:34,625
Did I ever say I wanted people
on my side?

1756
01:33:37,208 --> 01:33:39,000
I don't understand
what your problem is.

1757
01:33:39,041 --> 01:33:42,750
What are we supposed to do
after an incident like this?

1758
01:33:42,791 --> 01:33:47,208
Nothing? I asked you to file a
case against him, but you didn't.

1759
01:33:47,625 --> 01:33:49,375
I asked you to put a post against
him on Facebook

1760
01:33:49,375 --> 01:33:50,541
and you didn't do that either.

1761
01:33:50,583 --> 01:33:52,750
Now you don't want to tell the group?

1762
01:33:55,250 --> 01:33:57,583
What should I do? Act
alongside someone

1763
01:33:57,625 --> 01:33:59,500
who groped you for the rest of my life?

1764
01:34:01,125 --> 01:34:03,708
That's why I said there's
no need for all this.

1765
01:34:04,083 --> 01:34:06,791
I want to believe nothing
happened to me.

1766
01:34:06,875 --> 01:34:08,875
I don't want to be reminded of it.

1767
01:34:12,041 --> 01:34:13,458
Okay, Anjali.

1768
01:34:15,416 --> 01:34:17,333
It was my mistake.

1769
01:34:18,916 --> 01:34:22,208
Tell them that you didn't see him.

1770
01:34:22,875 --> 01:34:24,875
I'll be a liar before Madan.

1771
01:34:24,916 --> 01:34:26,416
I'll tell them,

1772
01:34:26,416 --> 01:34:29,583
I was the one who made
Madan say that.

1773
01:34:29,583 --> 01:34:32,750
So you won't be the only one
leaving the group.

1774
01:34:40,083 --> 01:34:44,208
A tiny balloon, the doctor said.

1775
01:34:44,208 --> 01:34:45,625
It might not burst.

1776
01:34:45,666 --> 01:34:48,750
But if it bursts, I'll be done
in twenty minutes.

1777
01:34:48,750 --> 01:34:49,791
Oh!

1778
01:34:49,916 --> 01:34:51,458
What are you saying?

1779
01:34:51,500 --> 01:34:54,125
We should treat it.

1780
01:34:54,125 --> 01:34:56,166
I said not to do anything.

1781
01:34:56,208 --> 01:34:58,875
To be honest, I didn't feel anything
when I heard the doctor.

1782
01:34:59,916 --> 01:35:04,583
I thought I had no more desires
left in life.

1783
01:35:05,375 --> 01:35:09,333
But, after Hari talked
about the trip,

1784
01:35:09,375 --> 01:35:11,625
I felt a whim to
see those places...

1785
01:35:11,666 --> 01:35:16,541
And die happily on that trip.

1786
01:35:16,583 --> 01:35:18,541
A crazy desire, right?

1787
01:35:19,291 --> 01:35:22,708
Aren't you thinking thinking
how terrible I am?

1788
01:35:22,750 --> 01:35:26,875
To roam the world at
the mercy of that bastard!

1789
01:35:31,791 --> 01:35:34,625
Leave it if she's willing
to compromise.

1790
01:35:34,625 --> 01:35:38,208
If she doesn't budge...

1791
01:35:38,250 --> 01:35:40,250
show her this.

1792
01:35:40,958 --> 01:35:42,166
Let's go.

1793
01:35:55,583 --> 01:35:57,791
Get the umbrella from the back.

1794
01:36:14,208 --> 01:36:18,291
How many more lies must I tell
to prove it happened?

1795
01:36:18,375 --> 01:36:20,625
I told this to Madan...

1796
01:36:20,666 --> 01:36:22,625
I saw Hari.

1797
01:36:23,125 --> 01:36:25,583
Now what more?

1798
01:36:25,625 --> 01:36:30,500
This isn't some story we made up
to trap an innocent man.

1799
01:36:30,500 --> 01:36:32,083
Is it?

1800
01:36:35,958 --> 01:36:37,333
We'll go in?

1801
01:36:43,041 --> 01:36:44,500
I'll text it to you.

1802
01:36:44,541 --> 01:36:47,000
My phone's charging upstairs.
Just tell me.

1803
01:36:47,041 --> 01:36:53,375
LE-VI-TI-RA-CETAM

1804
01:36:53,375 --> 01:36:54,708
250 MG

1805
01:36:54,708 --> 01:36:55,958
LEVITIRACETAM

1806
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:59,250
- Quite a name!
- I might collapse without it.

1807
01:36:59,250 --> 01:37:01,250
I'll go and buy it.

1808
01:37:02,916 --> 01:37:05,041
Aji... they're here.

1809
01:37:12,250 --> 01:37:13,250
Come outside.

1810
01:37:13,291 --> 01:37:15,125
I've got something to tell you.

1811
01:37:15,166 --> 01:37:17,250
Would you like some tea?

1812
01:37:17,291 --> 01:37:18,250
No, Madan.

1813
01:37:18,291 --> 01:37:20,000
- Some water?
- No.

1814
01:37:20,041 --> 01:37:22,208
Then go upstairs.

1815
01:37:22,208 --> 01:37:23,583
We'll talk there.

1816
01:37:27,458 --> 01:37:29,750
Hey! It's already 7.

1817
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:31,041
Not going to the temple today?

1818
01:37:31,041 --> 01:37:33,666
No. A friend is taking over.

1819
01:37:43,250 --> 01:37:45,041
I sent her upstairs.

1820
01:37:45,750 --> 01:37:48,208
Choose your words wisely.

1821
01:37:49,041 --> 01:37:51,625
Tell her we've
decided to fire him.

1822
01:37:52,416 --> 01:37:54,666
And as we planned-

1823
01:37:54,666 --> 01:37:56,666
play the apology card.

1824
01:37:56,708 --> 01:37:59,041
Don't mention the trip.

1825
01:37:59,041 --> 01:38:00,708
Who is going to apologise?

1826
01:38:00,750 --> 01:38:02,375
Aji can do it.

1827
01:38:02,625 --> 01:38:05,041
What about Vinay?
We should tell him.

1828
01:38:05,041 --> 01:38:06,333
Nandan is telling him.

1829
01:38:06,375 --> 01:38:07,958
Is she upstairs?

1830
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:09,458
Yes. She is.

1831
01:38:09,500 --> 01:38:10,750
Aji, let's go.

1832
01:38:13,458 --> 01:38:15,041
800 thousand!

1833
01:38:15,083 --> 01:38:16,750
800000! For each of us!

1834
01:38:16,750 --> 01:38:20,291
Stop saying it over
and over! I heard you!

1835
01:38:22,875 --> 01:38:26,125
Are they going to tell her about it?

1836
01:38:26,125 --> 01:38:28,583
No, no. They're looking to reach
a compromise.

1837
01:38:28,625 --> 01:38:30,875
A compromise? Don't
even think of it!

1838
01:38:30,875 --> 01:38:33,708
She'll dump me for that reason alone.

1839
01:38:42,416 --> 01:38:45,458
Never thought you'd
ask me such a thing!

1840
01:38:45,500 --> 01:38:46,875
No, dear...

1841
01:38:46,916 --> 01:38:50,666
We even prepared his dismissal letter.

1842
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:55,000
It only occurred to us after
we called you here.

1843
01:38:55,208 --> 01:38:57,666
Forgive him this once and it won't
break up the group.

1844
01:38:57,666 --> 01:38:59,458
If Sir finds out, he'll
be upset.

1845
01:38:59,500 --> 01:39:02,291
- It was my idea that they ask you.
- Yes.

1846
01:39:02,333 --> 01:39:03,583
Yeah, Aji told us.

1847
01:39:03,583 --> 01:39:06,791
Do you think it'll make any difference,
Aji?

1848
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:12,333
Is it true that she wanted
to take legal action?

1849
01:39:13,916 --> 01:39:17,583
No. I just made that up
and told Madan.

1850
01:39:17,625 --> 01:39:20,375
He's not as bad as you think,
my dear.

1851
01:39:20,416 --> 01:39:23,041
There's never been a complaint
against him.

1852
01:39:23,041 --> 01:39:25,500
This happened
because he was drunk.

1853
01:39:25,541 --> 01:39:27,666
Try and forgive him.

1854
01:39:27,666 --> 01:39:29,375
We are just asking you.

1855
01:39:29,375 --> 01:39:33,166
Forget it if you can't.
We'll hand the letter to Sir.

1856
01:39:37,500 --> 01:39:39,083
Bullshit.

1857
01:39:39,625 --> 01:39:41,375
Absolute bullshit!

1858
01:39:48,083 --> 01:39:50,291
- There's one other option, Madan.
- Tell me.

1859
01:39:50,333 --> 01:39:52,166
Let him stay. I'll quit.

1860
01:39:52,166 --> 01:39:54,666
No, no.

1861
01:39:54,666 --> 01:39:58,541
Either expel him, or
reach a compromise.

1862
01:39:58,583 --> 01:40:01,500
Don't say that word again.
It's so cheap.

1863
01:40:01,541 --> 01:40:04,666
You may vent it out,
But don't call Aji “cheap”.

1864
01:40:04,708 --> 01:40:07,333
I said that word is cheap.
Not Aji.

1865
01:40:07,333 --> 01:40:10,875
Sudheer, it's not fair what
we're asking of her.

1866
01:40:10,916 --> 01:40:13,250
She has the right to speak
her mind.

1867
01:40:13,291 --> 01:40:15,041
We're not defending him.

1868
01:40:15,208 --> 01:40:17,541
You're more important to us.

1869
01:40:19,416 --> 01:40:22,583
I can't imagine
meeting him again.

1870
01:40:23,666 --> 01:40:26,041
I need time to think.

1871
01:40:26,583 --> 01:40:28,250
Think about it, dear.

1872
01:40:28,500 --> 01:40:30,000
Take your time.

1873
01:40:30,208 --> 01:40:33,166
Also think, if you
were at fault too.

1874
01:40:33,166 --> 01:40:34,416
What fault?

1875
01:40:34,458 --> 01:40:37,750
I mean... Men lose
it when they're drunk.

1876
01:40:37,791 --> 01:40:39,541
They don't care even if it's
a family member.

1877
01:40:39,541 --> 01:40:43,833
I warned you many times not
to drink with men.

1878
01:40:44,500 --> 01:40:45,583
I see...

1879
01:40:46,541 --> 01:40:48,875
Shut your mouth, Selvan.

1880
01:40:50,125 --> 01:40:51,833
I've made up my mind.

1881
01:40:51,875 --> 01:40:53,875
You say I'm equally to blame.

1882
01:40:54,458 --> 01:40:56,000
But he did it to me, right?

1883
01:40:56,833 --> 01:40:58,541
I'll deal with it.

1884
01:40:58,583 --> 01:41:00,041
To hell with compromise!

1885
01:41:00,083 --> 01:41:02,250
Anjali, my dear. Wait.

1886
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:05,583
Anjali, wait.

1887
01:41:07,500 --> 01:41:08,708
Let's talk about it.

1888
01:41:08,708 --> 01:41:10,583
There's nothing more to talk
about, Santhosh.

1889
01:41:10,625 --> 01:41:13,666
Selvan says he did it because
I was drinking with all of you.

1890
01:41:13,875 --> 01:41:16,458
That's not what I meant,
my dear.

1891
01:41:16,750 --> 01:41:19,333
You didn't let me explain fully.

1892
01:41:19,333 --> 01:41:21,416
Is that what I meant to say, Aji?

1893
01:41:21,416 --> 01:41:23,958
Look at this.
His dismissal letter.

1894
01:41:24,083 --> 01:41:27,166
We're not bluffing you.
Look at everyone's signature.

1895
01:41:27,166 --> 01:41:29,000
Read it calmly.

1896
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:30,666
Selvan is old-fashioned.

1897
01:41:30,666 --> 01:41:33,083
We don't share his views.

1898
01:41:34,583 --> 01:41:38,041
We took the decision as soon
as Madan told us the matter.

1899
01:41:38,083 --> 01:41:40,875
Did we even ask you for details?

1900
01:41:40,875 --> 01:41:43,791
We trusted what you said.

1901
01:41:43,833 --> 01:41:47,291
If you trust me so much, why
ask me to forgive him?

1902
01:41:47,291 --> 01:41:48,291
Just to check...

1903
01:41:48,333 --> 01:41:53,750
If we have other options
than just kick him out?

1904
01:41:53,791 --> 01:41:58,041
We discussed whether, as artists,
we could take a different stance.

1905
01:41:58,041 --> 01:42:01,833
I said we'd let her decide.

1906
01:42:02,583 --> 01:42:05,000
I don't want to be a damn artist!

1907
01:42:05,041 --> 01:42:08,500
I can never face him or
share the stage with him again.

1908
01:42:08,541 --> 01:42:11,625
She's making a simple point.

1909
01:42:11,625 --> 01:42:13,958
Why on earth can't you
understand?

1910
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,166
I don't want anyone to
understand, Vinay.

1911
01:42:16,166 --> 01:42:17,875
It happened to me.

1912
01:42:17,916 --> 01:42:19,916
So I'll handle it somehow.

1913
01:42:28,541 --> 01:42:29,583
Anjali...

1914
01:42:30,708 --> 01:42:33,041
Just look at everyone.

1915
01:42:33,083 --> 01:42:36,291
They're scared stiff. So am I.

1916
01:42:36,333 --> 01:42:39,041
We're scared you'll tell people
and report it to the police.

1917
01:42:39,083 --> 01:42:41,541
That's the only reason
we decided to fire him.

1918
01:42:41,583 --> 01:42:44,375
Nothing to do with trust,
as Cijin put it.

1919
01:42:44,416 --> 01:42:48,166
Santhosh, speak for yourself.
Don't talk for the others.

1920
01:42:48,208 --> 01:42:49,750
That's what everyone thinks.

1921
01:42:49,750 --> 01:42:51,458
Did anyone see him do it?

1922
01:42:51,500 --> 01:42:53,291
We haven't even asked Hari.

1923
01:42:53,416 --> 01:42:54,750
Fear! That's it!

1924
01:42:54,791 --> 01:42:56,541
- You might be a coward!
- Yes, I am!

1925
01:42:56,583 --> 01:42:59,000
We're not cowards like you.
We're fighting for justice.

1926
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
Sanosh is right.

1927
01:43:04,958 --> 01:43:06,458
What exactly happened?

1928
01:43:06,500 --> 01:43:09,208
How did it happen?
When did it happen?

1929
01:43:09,250 --> 01:43:10,791
No one is even allowed to ask.

1930
01:43:10,833 --> 01:43:12,208
It's a sin to ask!

1931
01:43:15,125 --> 01:43:17,000
Just swallow the story, whole.

1932
01:43:19,083 --> 01:43:20,875
What do you want to know?

1933
01:43:20,916 --> 01:43:22,958
I'll tell you everything!

1934
01:43:23,083 --> 01:43:25,041
And you can all be happy.

1935
01:43:27,250 --> 01:43:30,708
Vinay, this is exactly the
scene I wanted to avoid!

1936
01:43:30,750 --> 01:43:34,125
You don't have to answer
to anybody, Anjali.

1937
01:43:34,125 --> 01:43:35,875
Those who want to, will
believe it.

1938
01:43:36,583 --> 01:43:38,333
Are you all mad?

1939
01:43:38,791 --> 01:43:41,416
Then why not tell
her the real matter.

1940
01:43:42,833 --> 01:43:44,625
Prashanth, what do you mean?

1941
01:43:44,666 --> 01:43:46,500
Mind your tongue.

1942
01:43:46,500 --> 01:43:48,958
Stop this bloody drama.

1943
01:43:50,541 --> 01:43:53,000
She's not here to be insulted.

1944
01:43:54,041 --> 01:43:56,500
Come on, Anjali! Let's go!

1945
01:43:56,541 --> 01:43:58,166
Anjali, one minute.

1946
01:43:59,583 --> 01:44:00,875
Can I ask you one question?

1947
01:44:00,958 --> 01:44:02,083
Just one question.

1948
01:44:03,166 --> 01:44:06,291
Madan said it happened
at 2.30 in the night.

1949
01:44:06,333 --> 01:44:07,708
Is that true?

1950
01:44:07,875 --> 01:44:09,083
- Yes.
- Okay.

1951
01:44:13,875 --> 01:44:15,333
Look at this photo.

1952
01:44:15,375 --> 01:44:17,375
Everyone should see this.

1953
01:44:20,375 --> 01:44:22,875
Delna and I had
a fight that night.

1954
01:44:22,916 --> 01:44:25,458
She video-called me that night
and I clicked it.

1955
01:44:25,500 --> 01:44:27,125
I mean... took a screenshot.

1956
01:44:27,833 --> 01:44:29,541
Look, who this is.

1957
01:44:30,458 --> 01:44:31,666
Come and see.

1958
01:44:31,708 --> 01:44:33,708
It's Hari. Sleeping.

1959
01:44:34,166 --> 01:44:35,458
Fast asleep.

1960
01:44:35,500 --> 01:44:36,916
Now look at the time.

1961
01:44:36,958 --> 01:44:38,666
2.12

1962
01:44:38,708 --> 01:44:40,625
Going by what Anjali said-

1963
01:44:40,666 --> 01:44:44,041
Did he walk in his sleep
and do it?

1964
01:44:50,458 --> 01:44:52,875
We've been talking since
the morning.

1965
01:44:52,875 --> 01:44:53,791
Why didn't you show this
to us before?

1966
01:44:53,833 --> 01:44:57,000
I just noticed it now, when
I was checking my chat.

1967
01:44:57,958 --> 01:44:59,666
Show me.

1968
01:45:09,125 --> 01:45:11,708
This photo is a problem, Anjali.

1969
01:45:15,541 --> 01:45:17,833
So what do you want me to say?

1970
01:45:17,875 --> 01:45:19,250
That's enough!

1971
01:45:20,541 --> 01:45:22,166
Keep him in the group.

1972
01:45:22,208 --> 01:45:25,250
Anjali! You're under no obligation
to convince anyone.

1973
01:45:25,291 --> 01:45:28,250
That's not right, Vinay.
We decided to fire Hari.

1974
01:45:28,291 --> 01:45:31,041
That calls for some obligation.

1975
01:45:31,041 --> 01:45:32,833
- Right, Madan?
- Yeah.

1976
01:45:34,500 --> 01:45:35,583
See...

1977
01:45:35,666 --> 01:45:37,916
There was no
such need until now.

1978
01:45:38,708 --> 01:45:41,333
But this photo is
quite confusing.

1979
01:45:42,333 --> 01:45:44,750
Can I ask you something
if you don't mind?

1980
01:45:44,791 --> 01:45:46,416
You were fast asleep.

1981
01:45:46,458 --> 01:45:48,625
Did you see him clearly?

1982
01:45:48,625 --> 01:45:49,875
You're stooping so low.

1983
01:45:49,916 --> 01:45:51,375
So be it!

1984
01:45:51,375 --> 01:45:54,166
I want to know how someone
who was sleeping in my room,

1985
01:45:54,166 --> 01:45:56,916
till 2.12 that night, could get
there at 2.30?

1986
01:45:56,958 --> 01:45:59,041
To hell with your time tricks.

1987
01:45:59,041 --> 01:46:02,291
Whether he came walking
or flying is irrelevant.

1988
01:46:02,333 --> 01:46:03,875
She saw him. And that's enough!

1989
01:46:03,916 --> 01:46:05,750
Why are you throwing a fit?

1990
01:46:05,750 --> 01:46:07,291
Jolly had a doubt.

1991
01:46:07,291 --> 01:46:09,541
And it's a reasonable doubt.

1992
01:46:09,541 --> 01:46:10,791
Let her speak.

1993
01:46:10,791 --> 01:46:12,791
She needs no lawyer.

1994
01:46:14,958 --> 01:46:17,625
Madan, please come. I have to
discuss something with you.

1995
01:46:17,625 --> 01:46:19,625
Why tell a secret now?

1996
01:46:19,625 --> 01:46:21,916
This is a group
discussion, right?

1997
01:46:21,958 --> 01:46:24,416
Anjali, leave if you want to.

1998
01:46:24,958 --> 01:46:27,833
I will not force you to answer
their questions.

1999
01:46:27,875 --> 01:46:29,041
You can leave...

2000
01:46:29,041 --> 01:46:32,916
But don't complain that
no-one believed what you said.

2001
01:46:32,958 --> 01:46:34,625
Enough, Santhosh!

2002
01:46:34,666 --> 01:46:37,208
Learn how to talk to
a woman first.

2003
01:46:38,041 --> 01:46:39,083
My dear.

2004
01:46:39,083 --> 01:46:41,083
For the group's sake...

2005
01:46:41,958 --> 01:46:44,541
Can you tell them, just like
you told me;

2006
01:46:44,541 --> 01:46:46,125
What happened that night?

2007
01:46:46,250 --> 01:46:49,458
It will put an end to all
their doubts.

2008
01:46:57,375 --> 01:46:58,958
That night-

2009
01:46:59,083 --> 01:47:01,458
after playing cards,
I went to my room.

2010
01:47:02,708 --> 01:47:04,083
What time?

2011
01:47:05,708 --> 01:47:07,125
I don't remember.

2012
01:47:07,125 --> 01:47:08,375
Don't remember.

2013
01:47:08,375 --> 01:47:09,958
Okay, continue.

2014
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,166
I got very tired by night...

2015
01:47:13,041 --> 01:47:15,083
Should be the drinks,

2016
01:47:16,375 --> 01:47:18,458
I was feeling dizzy as well.

2017
01:47:19,208 --> 01:47:20,875
I went to bed soon.

2018
01:47:22,750 --> 01:47:24,125
After I fell asleep…

2019
01:47:24,166 --> 01:47:25,750
Where did you sleep?

2020
01:47:25,833 --> 01:47:27,416
Let her speak, Santhosh.

2021
01:47:31,083 --> 01:47:33,041
There was a sofa in the room.

2022
01:47:33,041 --> 01:47:34,916
That's where I slept.

2023
01:47:37,500 --> 01:47:39,083
After I slept...

2024
01:47:43,125 --> 01:47:46,416
It was after about
twenty minutes...

2025
01:47:50,666 --> 01:47:54,000
Aren't you ashamed to make
her say it again and again?

2026
01:47:56,291 --> 01:47:58,458
She doesn't have to.

2027
01:47:59,375 --> 01:48:01,458
You said he put his hand
through the window.

2028
01:48:01,500 --> 01:48:03,958
So the window was open?

2029
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:05,375
Yes.

2030
01:48:06,458 --> 01:48:10,166
It was an a/c room. Then why
did you leave the window open?

2031
01:48:10,166 --> 01:48:13,708
Shamna wasn't feeling well.

2032
01:48:13,750 --> 01:48:15,916
So Shajitha asked me not
to turn the a/c on.

2033
01:48:15,958 --> 01:48:18,541
That's why I left the window open.

2034
01:48:19,041 --> 01:48:20,041
Okay.

2035
01:48:20,583 --> 01:48:22,916
So you were asleep when
this happened?

2036
01:48:25,833 --> 01:48:28,416
Anjali, we believe everything
you've said.

2037
01:48:29,291 --> 01:48:32,041
But how could this person, seen
in the photo fast asleep,

2038
01:48:32,083 --> 01:48:34,916
know you were sleeping
on the sofa?

2039
01:48:34,958 --> 01:48:37,666
How did he know the window
was open?

2040
01:48:41,333 --> 01:48:43,625
We saw him go to the terrace several times,

2041
01:48:43,625 --> 01:48:45,833
saying his phone was out
of range.

2042
01:48:46,333 --> 01:48:48,791
And her room was on the way
to the terrace.

2043
01:48:48,791 --> 01:48:50,291
He might have done it
on the way.

2044
01:48:51,041 --> 01:48:53,750
Come on. What are you trying
to prove?

2045
01:48:54,583 --> 01:48:56,250
Nothing to prove.

2046
01:48:57,041 --> 01:48:58,708
I have a strong doubt,
that's all.

2047
01:48:59,291 --> 01:49:00,833
You were very drunk that night.

2048
01:49:01,958 --> 01:49:03,166
Fast asleep as well.

2049
01:49:03,625 --> 01:49:05,250
Shajitha didn't see anything either.

2050
01:49:06,208 --> 01:49:09,041
I think it was a
'Tactile Hallucination'.

2051
01:49:09,041 --> 01:49:10,125
What crap is that?

2052
01:49:10,166 --> 01:49:12,375
Look it up on Google.

2053
01:49:12,416 --> 01:49:17,875
It's more like an illusion of
somebody touching or pushing...

2054
01:49:17,916 --> 01:49:19,625
It stems from fear.

2055
01:49:19,666 --> 01:49:22,958
Alcohol aggravates
it. That's all.

2056
01:49:23,916 --> 01:49:25,083
Right!

2057
01:49:25,083 --> 01:49:27,125
The whole thing was an illusion.

2058
01:49:27,208 --> 01:49:31,375
What he did to me, and how
I was scared till morning.

2059
01:49:31,375 --> 01:49:32,708
It was all my imagination.

2060
01:49:33,625 --> 01:49:37,208
Being shut up at home, not going
to the workplace-

2061
01:49:37,250 --> 01:49:39,250
it was all just in my head, right?

2062
01:49:42,041 --> 01:49:45,458
Anjali, seeing this photo
made me doubt.

2063
01:49:46,583 --> 01:49:49,541
Now just tell us that you
actually saw him.

2064
01:49:49,583 --> 01:49:50,708
We trust you.

2065
01:49:52,958 --> 01:49:54,875
Did you really see
Hari running away?

2066
01:50:12,166 --> 01:50:13,583
No.

2067
01:50:13,583 --> 01:50:14,625
I didn't see him.

2068
01:50:14,625 --> 01:50:15,458
What?

2069
01:50:15,500 --> 01:50:18,083
- What nonsense are you saying?
- You didn't see him?

2070
01:50:18,083 --> 01:50:19,375
I didn't see him.

2071
01:50:19,416 --> 01:50:21,375
But I'm sure it was him.

2072
01:50:21,416 --> 01:50:23,750
- We've been fools!
- Enough talking!

2073
01:50:23,791 --> 01:50:26,125
She didn't see him, dammit!

2074
01:50:26,125 --> 01:50:28,250
Then why the hell
did you lie to Madan?

2075
01:50:28,291 --> 01:50:29,875
Too bad, Anjali.

2076
01:50:29,916 --> 01:50:33,708
Imagine if we'd taken her word
for it and fired him.

2077
01:50:33,750 --> 01:50:34,875
Tell us the truth.

2078
01:50:34,916 --> 01:50:38,041
Sudheer, not to play
a detective, right?

2079
01:50:38,041 --> 01:50:38,666
Anjali!

2080
01:50:38,708 --> 01:50:41,041
Don't be intimidated by their questions.

2081
01:50:41,041 --> 01:50:42,916
You said you saw
him. Just say it again.

2082
01:50:42,958 --> 01:50:44,041
She said she didn't.

2083
01:50:44,041 --> 01:50:45,250
Stop coaxing her.

2084
01:50:45,958 --> 01:50:47,208
We need to know.

2085
01:50:47,208 --> 01:50:49,875
Why did you tell such a
made-up story?

2086
01:50:49,916 --> 01:50:51,916
It's not made up.

2087
01:50:52,791 --> 01:50:53,833
Here. It fell out of the pocket

2088
01:50:53,833 --> 01:50:55,541
of the man who ran away.

2089
01:50:56,750 --> 01:50:59,541
You all know
whose key it is, right?

2090
01:51:00,833 --> 01:51:02,083
Not only that.

2091
01:51:02,125 --> 01:51:04,791
The horrid smell of his perfume
was all over the place.

2092
01:51:05,958 --> 01:51:08,541
- Isn't that Hari's?
- Yeah.

2093
01:51:09,375 --> 01:51:10,916
That is his key.

2094
01:51:24,625 --> 01:51:26,500
Then how did the photo
make sense?

2095
01:51:26,500 --> 01:51:28,500
You saw what time it was
in the screenshot.

2096
01:51:28,500 --> 01:51:29,333
Cijin!

2097
01:51:29,375 --> 01:51:31,875
- What?
- Come here.

2098
01:51:40,625 --> 01:51:43,083
How did she get that key?

2099
01:51:43,125 --> 01:51:44,125
No idea.

2100
01:51:44,916 --> 01:51:46,958
If you stare at me,
I'll stare at you too.

2101
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:48,833
How did she get that key?

2102
01:52:11,500 --> 01:52:13,541
What is this, Nandan?
I called you so many times.

2103
01:52:14,666 --> 01:52:17,125
I can't see you. Out of network?

2104
01:52:20,625 --> 01:52:22,916
Wow! Perfect timing.

2105
01:52:24,208 --> 01:52:25,916
Living happily, right?

2106
01:52:27,791 --> 01:52:29,291
She's right.

2107
01:52:29,333 --> 01:52:32,500
Hari threw a tantrum that morning
over the missing car keys.

2108
01:52:32,541 --> 01:52:33,791
That's true.

2109
01:52:33,833 --> 01:52:36,666
Someone had come from the
workshop to tow the car away.

2110
01:52:37,583 --> 01:52:42,250
They say, the truth will always
come out.

2111
01:52:42,791 --> 01:52:46,916
Or God will not drop the
key out of his pocket in time.

2112
01:52:46,958 --> 01:52:48,625
- Isn't it?
- Definitely!

2113
01:52:48,666 --> 01:52:52,000
There is enough evidence to
believe that Hari did it.

2114
01:52:52,875 --> 01:52:54,125
But, Anjali...

2115
01:52:54,166 --> 01:52:57,958
Why did you lie to Madan that
you saw him running away?

2116
01:52:59,041 --> 01:53:01,125
Sudheer, it's almost like
she did see him.

2117
01:53:01,125 --> 01:53:04,166
There's no such thing as
“almost seeing”.

2118
01:53:04,166 --> 01:53:05,750
She saw him or she didn't.

2119
01:53:05,750 --> 01:53:08,000
Answer the question, Anjali.

2120
01:53:08,041 --> 01:53:10,458
Why did you say you saw him?

2121
01:53:10,458 --> 01:53:11,833
Even after I said I saw him,

2122
01:53:11,875 --> 01:53:16,166
you asked me to forgive and
compromise.

2123
01:53:17,125 --> 01:53:18,500
What was that?

2124
01:53:18,541 --> 01:53:20,541
Tactile hallucination!

2125
01:53:21,333 --> 01:53:22,666
Cool!

2126
01:53:26,416 --> 01:53:29,458
What medicine is that, Aji?
It was hard to find.

2127
01:53:29,458 --> 01:53:31,083
It's not easily available.

2128
01:53:31,125 --> 01:53:33,458
Vinay, can you drop
me at the bus stop?

2129
01:53:33,500 --> 01:53:36,083
Okay. Give Hari this key.

2130
01:53:37,166 --> 01:53:42,333
I have no intention of filing a
police case or going public.

2131
01:53:42,375 --> 01:53:45,500
I want to believe this
has not happened to me.

2132
01:53:47,041 --> 01:53:48,166
I...

2133
01:53:48,166 --> 01:53:50,166
I just want to sleep.

2134
01:53:50,875 --> 01:53:54,041
So right now, I've decided
to quit the group-

2135
01:53:54,083 --> 01:53:55,166
Anjali, one moment!

2136
01:53:58,791 --> 01:54:00,375
It wasn't Hari...

2137
01:54:00,416 --> 01:54:02,083
It was him! It was this creep,
who groped you!

2138
01:54:02,083 --> 01:54:04,083
How dare you, fucking asshole!

2139
01:54:04,083 --> 01:54:06,083
Let go of my hand!

2140
01:54:08,083 --> 01:54:09,083
Leave me!

2141
01:54:10,291 --> 01:54:11,791
This key is your proof.

2142
01:54:11,791 --> 01:54:12,875
Right?

2143
01:54:12,916 --> 01:54:14,500
Isn't this key the proof?

2144
01:54:14,541 --> 01:54:16,458
Hari and I were in the
same room that night.

2145
01:54:16,500 --> 01:54:17,666
That night,

2146
01:54:17,666 --> 01:54:21,125
he wanted cigarettes and he
took the key from Hari.

2147
01:54:21,125 --> 01:54:22,250
Did you see me?

2148
01:54:23,541 --> 01:54:24,500
Yes, I did.

2149
01:54:24,541 --> 01:54:26,500
The key went missing after that.

2150
01:54:26,541 --> 01:54:27,750
I remember it well.

2151
01:54:27,750 --> 01:54:30,250
I remember clearly that you took
the key.

2152
01:54:30,291 --> 01:54:33,166
Just a second. Just a second.

2153
01:54:33,208 --> 01:54:34,458
Nandan…

2154
01:54:34,500 --> 01:54:36,458
Is there any truth in
what Sanosh is saying?

2155
01:54:36,500 --> 01:54:38,416
What are you implying?

2156
01:54:38,416 --> 01:54:39,583
Am I crazy?

2157
01:54:39,583 --> 01:54:41,583
He's settling a score!

2158
01:54:42,125 --> 01:54:43,583
Nandan.

2159
01:54:43,583 --> 01:54:46,416
Stop blabbering and answer
my question.

2160
01:54:46,458 --> 01:54:49,375
Did you take the key from
him or not?

2161
01:54:49,416 --> 01:54:50,958
No!

2162
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:52,166
Listen...

2163
01:54:52,208 --> 01:54:53,666
Stop lying.

2164
01:54:53,708 --> 01:54:55,333
Tell us the truth.

2165
01:54:55,458 --> 01:54:59,208
It is true that he said there
were cigarettes in the car...

2166
01:54:59,958 --> 01:55:03,958
He said he had left his car keys
in a basket on the dining table.

2167
01:55:03,958 --> 01:55:07,041
I went to get them.
But there was nothing there.

2168
01:55:07,083 --> 01:55:08,541
A while back, Jolly said

2169
01:55:08,583 --> 01:55:10,958
he saw you going to Anjali's
room at midnight.

2170
01:55:11,541 --> 01:55:13,500
Why did you go there?

2171
01:55:14,250 --> 01:55:16,625
Why would I go to Anjali's?

2172
01:55:18,250 --> 01:55:20,791
Yes. I had a slight headache.

2173
01:55:20,833 --> 01:55:24,291
I went there to see if Shajitha
had any medicine.

2174
01:55:24,291 --> 01:55:25,583
He's the one!

2175
01:55:25,625 --> 01:55:26,958
See!

2176
01:55:26,958 --> 01:55:29,500
I just made up
that jolly saw him.

2177
01:55:30,625 --> 01:55:33,750
But he was quick with
the 'headache' story!

2178
01:55:33,750 --> 01:55:35,541
You bloody bastard!

2179
01:55:35,583 --> 01:55:38,500
Are you fucking with me?

2180
01:55:38,541 --> 01:55:40,708
Leave him...
Vinay... Leave him...

2181
01:55:41,916 --> 01:55:44,291
And did you get the medicine?

2182
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:46,000
No.

2183
01:55:46,541 --> 01:55:49,333
Shajitha didn't have any medicine.

2184
01:55:49,666 --> 01:55:51,666
That means you saw Shajitha?

2185
01:55:52,458 --> 01:55:54,375
I'll check with her.

2186
01:55:59,291 --> 01:56:01,416
Twenty years at the newspapers.

2187
01:56:01,416 --> 01:56:03,416
I've dealt with bigger assholes
than you.

2188
01:56:03,416 --> 01:56:05,750
It's written all over your face.

2189
01:56:05,750 --> 01:56:08,458
You'd better stop lying
and tell us the truth.

2190
01:56:11,291 --> 01:56:14,125
Am I the liar?
You filthy bugger.

2191
01:56:14,166 --> 01:56:16,750
Answer me, you dickhead!

2192
01:56:16,791 --> 01:56:19,458
You are the only one who
is lying.

2193
01:56:19,500 --> 01:56:21,500
Let go, dammit!

2194
01:56:22,375 --> 01:56:25,041
I've got something to tell
you all.

2195
01:56:25,041 --> 01:56:28,375
Anjali never came to Madan
or said anything to him.

2196
01:56:28,375 --> 01:56:31,000
She said everything
to him... To Vinay.

2197
01:56:33,041 --> 01:56:35,708
Anjali did not even see Madan.

2198
01:56:35,708 --> 01:56:37,250
Know that?

2199
01:56:38,291 --> 01:56:40,250
Vinay has been
here since yesterday.

2200
01:56:40,250 --> 01:56:42,250
He told the whole story to Madan.

2201
01:56:42,250 --> 01:56:45,250
And he recounted it to us.

2202
01:56:45,291 --> 01:56:47,750
Anjali never spoke to Madan.

2203
01:56:47,791 --> 01:56:49,750
It's all rubbish!

2204
01:56:49,791 --> 01:56:52,666
He somehow wanted
to kick Hari out.

2205
01:56:52,666 --> 01:56:55,708
That's the thing. And...

2206
01:56:55,708 --> 01:56:59,208
You'd better not force me
to say more!

2207
01:56:59,250 --> 01:57:00,541
Got it?

2208
01:57:02,625 --> 01:57:06,208
Madan, was it Vinay who told
you everything?

2209
01:57:06,208 --> 01:57:07,916
He is a liar.

2210
01:57:09,375 --> 01:57:11,333
No. That's the truth.

2211
01:57:12,666 --> 01:57:14,416
I told everything to Vinay.

2212
01:57:15,416 --> 01:57:17,833
Hear that? Did everyone hear it?

2213
01:57:17,875 --> 01:57:21,750
Vinay didn't talk about it
because of the friction

2214
01:57:21,791 --> 01:57:23,166
between him and Hari.

2215
01:57:26,750 --> 01:57:28,000
When did she say this?

2216
01:57:28,041 --> 01:57:31,041
How could I have talked about it?

2217
01:57:31,083 --> 01:57:32,083
Okay.

2218
01:57:32,125 --> 01:57:33,250
You saw it today.

2219
01:57:33,291 --> 01:57:36,291
Santhosh immediately brought
up my issue with Hari.

2220
01:57:37,708 --> 01:57:39,583
That's why I asked Madan
to address it.

2221
01:57:39,583 --> 01:57:42,500
You shouldn't have
fooled us, Madan.

2222
01:57:42,541 --> 01:57:45,000
I did it for the good of the group.

2223
01:57:45,041 --> 01:57:47,000
Is that a crime?

2224
01:57:47,041 --> 01:57:49,625
What did Shajitha say?
Did she see Nandan?

2225
01:57:50,875 --> 01:57:52,458
Why are you hesitating?

2226
01:57:52,458 --> 01:57:54,000
What did Shajitha say?

2227
01:57:54,041 --> 01:57:55,291
If it's about Nandan...

2228
01:57:55,416 --> 01:57:57,291
Yes, he went to her to
get the tablet.

2229
01:57:58,833 --> 01:58:00,625
Everyone should listen.

2230
01:58:00,666 --> 01:58:02,666
Especially you!

2231
01:58:04,041 --> 01:58:07,000
Anjali. Didn't you doubt me?

2232
01:58:10,291 --> 01:58:12,708
We'll settle scores later.

2233
01:58:15,041 --> 01:58:18,666
Shajitha said something
else too.

2234
01:58:21,500 --> 01:58:23,750
I'm not sure how to tell you.

2235
01:58:30,541 --> 01:58:32,041
Our daughter saw it, she said.

2236
01:58:35,125 --> 01:58:39,041
She saw Anjali
and Vinay kissing.

2237
01:58:40,666 --> 01:58:42,291
What's that?

2238
01:58:42,375 --> 01:58:43,791
What nonsense!

2239
01:58:45,083 --> 01:58:47,958
I'm just telling you what
Shajitha said.

2240
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:49,041
What?

2241
01:58:49,083 --> 01:58:51,541
Anjali and I were seen kissing?

2242
01:58:51,583 --> 01:58:53,291
Did you hear that, Anjali?

2243
01:58:53,291 --> 01:58:54,916
Hilarious!

2244
01:58:54,916 --> 01:58:57,416
How much will you twist
this case?

2245
01:58:57,416 --> 01:58:58,208
Vinay...

2246
01:58:58,208 --> 01:59:01,125
I haven't completely believed
what my daughter has said.

2247
01:59:01,750 --> 01:59:04,041
If it didn't happen, just forget it.

2248
01:59:04,041 --> 01:59:06,333
Do I even have to tell you that?

2249
01:59:09,166 --> 01:59:10,708
We kissed, it seems!

2250
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:14,750
This is the problem with your generation.

2251
01:59:15,416 --> 01:59:18,916
If a man and woman get close,
you go looking for a scandal.

2252
01:59:18,916 --> 01:59:20,833
You talk about it too.

2253
01:59:20,833 --> 01:59:23,708
Today has been such a day.

2254
01:59:23,708 --> 01:59:26,291
Or she would have whacked you
for the things you've said.

2255
01:59:27,833 --> 01:59:31,000
Listen! My wife and I
are still married.

2256
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:32,166
So,

2257
01:59:32,166 --> 01:59:35,541
I don't need to find a relationship
elsewhere.

2258
01:59:36,583 --> 01:59:37,833
And that too with her.

2259
01:59:39,875 --> 01:59:41,541
Kissing, it seems!

2260
01:59:44,041 --> 01:59:46,125
I got it now.

2261
01:59:46,166 --> 01:59:48,166
It clicked with me now.

2262
01:59:49,500 --> 01:59:51,750
Want to know what your daughter saw?

2263
01:59:51,791 --> 01:59:53,958
The scene where Devadatta and
Padmini kisses

2264
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:55,500
in the shadow play.

2265
01:59:55,708 --> 01:59:57,000
That's what she saw.

2266
01:59:57,041 --> 01:59:58,250
Rubbish!

2267
02:00:00,750 --> 02:00:01,750
Got it, sorry.

2268
02:00:02,625 --> 02:00:03,625
Sorry.

2269
02:00:05,083 --> 02:00:09,291
There's no point saying sorry
after talking such nonsense.

2270
02:00:10,791 --> 02:00:13,250
Anjali, he had said such baseless
stuff and you -

2271
02:00:13,250 --> 02:00:16,041
Enough is enough, Vinay.
Stop it!

2272
02:00:17,541 --> 02:00:19,666
How many more lies must I tell?

2273
02:00:19,708 --> 02:00:22,041
Who else should I fear?

2274
02:00:22,083 --> 02:00:24,333
I'm done. Listen.

2275
02:00:24,375 --> 02:00:27,333
He and I have been in a
relationship for the past one year.

2276
02:00:30,125 --> 02:00:34,208
I don't know what the kid saw
but we kissed at the resort that day.

2277
02:00:34,208 --> 02:00:35,500
Not just that day.

2278
02:00:35,541 --> 02:00:37,541
It's happened many times before.

2279
02:00:39,708 --> 02:00:42,208
Because we love each other.

2280
02:00:42,208 --> 02:00:45,291
I know this is a
complex relationship.

2281
02:00:48,458 --> 02:00:50,750
But we are in love.

2282
02:00:52,250 --> 02:00:54,125
He might be afraid of you all.

2283
02:00:54,166 --> 02:00:56,166
I used to be too.

2284
02:00:56,791 --> 02:00:57,916
Not anymore.

2285
02:01:00,333 --> 02:01:02,625
Haven't I asked you
a thousand times?

2286
02:01:02,625 --> 02:01:07,458
If there's anything
between you and her?

2287
02:01:07,458 --> 02:01:09,250
Take your hands off, Prashanth!

2288
02:01:09,291 --> 02:01:10,666
This is none of your business.

2289
02:01:10,708 --> 02:01:14,000
So, I was in love with someone,

2290
02:01:14,500 --> 02:01:17,291
who was sleeping with a
married man.

2291
02:01:17,333 --> 02:01:19,833
Wow! That's another love story!

2292
02:01:19,875 --> 02:01:22,875
Selvan, didn't I tell you?

2293
02:01:22,875 --> 02:01:24,875
They are an item.

2294
02:01:26,250 --> 02:01:27,708
What a show!

2295
02:01:27,750 --> 02:01:31,291
Bringing the key.
Making Madan talk about it all.

2296
02:01:31,333 --> 02:01:34,791
We all decide to fire Hari.

2297
02:01:35,416 --> 02:01:38,500
Do you idiots get it?

2298
02:01:38,541 --> 02:01:43,000
This was all a drama they both
played to get Hari out.

2299
02:01:43,750 --> 02:01:47,250
I don't think anyone groped her.

2300
02:01:48,583 --> 02:01:52,333
Anjali, are you happy now?

2301
02:01:53,041 --> 02:01:55,833
I told you they would say this.

2302
02:01:55,833 --> 02:01:59,291
Keep telling the truth. Go on.

2303
02:02:04,041 --> 02:02:08,250
Do you all think I was lying
about what happened to me?

2304
02:02:14,875 --> 02:02:17,583
You don't have to believe it.

2305
02:02:18,416 --> 02:02:21,083
Do you think I was lying, Aji?

2306
02:02:26,208 --> 02:02:29,250
First you said it was Hari.
We believed it.

2307
02:02:29,250 --> 02:02:32,291
Then it was Nandan.
We believed that too.

2308
02:02:32,333 --> 02:02:36,000
How can we believe something
that you didn't even see?

2309
02:02:36,083 --> 02:02:41,916
What if tomorrow you get a
feeling that I did it?

2310
02:02:41,958 --> 02:02:43,958
What do we do then?

2311
02:03:54,625 --> 02:03:58,500
I've been following you for
ten minutes.

2312
02:03:58,625 --> 02:04:00,208
Say something.

2313
02:04:05,416 --> 02:04:07,291
You won't get a damn bus,
standing here.

2314
02:04:07,291 --> 02:04:09,291
Let me drop you home.

2315
02:04:14,375 --> 02:04:17,875
Anjali, please say something.

2316
02:04:20,791 --> 02:04:23,666
All that is over, Vinay.

2317
02:04:23,708 --> 02:04:25,708
I quit Arangu.

2318
02:04:26,833 --> 02:04:31,291
I begged you to tell them
that you saw him.

2319
02:04:33,083 --> 02:04:35,958
I did not see him, Vinay!

2320
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,000
That's why I said 'I did not
see him'.

2321
02:04:39,333 --> 02:04:41,458
Did you notice something?

2322
02:04:41,458 --> 02:04:43,958
None of them even asked that.

2323
02:04:44,041 --> 02:04:45,041
What?

2324
02:04:45,208 --> 02:04:47,708
If it was not Hari, who was it?

2325
02:04:48,250 --> 02:04:50,750
None of them asked that.

2326
02:04:55,958 --> 02:05:01,083
When I think about it now,
I feel you were right.

2327
02:05:02,541 --> 02:05:04,916
Nothing happened to you.

2328
02:05:04,916 --> 02:05:06,958
No-one did anything to you.

2329
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:09,958
Don't you want to
believe the same?

2330
02:05:09,958 --> 02:05:11,958
That is enough.

2331
02:05:13,333 --> 02:05:14,958
To tell the truth,

2332
02:05:14,958 --> 02:05:18,916
there was no need for us
to tell Madan.

2333
02:05:18,958 --> 02:05:20,958
Not us. I mean, me.

2334
02:05:22,541 --> 02:05:24,708
What do you really think?

2335
02:05:24,708 --> 02:05:26,708
Could it have been Hari?

2336
02:05:27,958 --> 02:05:31,625
I was so confused when Jolly
showed that photo.

2337
02:05:32,458 --> 02:05:35,333
What do you think, Anjali?

2338
02:05:37,166 --> 02:05:39,333
I don't know.

2339
02:05:39,375 --> 02:05:42,500
But when I saw everyone
defending Hari-

2340
02:05:42,541 --> 02:05:46,250
I felt Hari's presence in
that house.

2341
02:05:48,125 --> 02:05:51,166
Your instincts are right.

2342
02:05:51,166 --> 02:05:54,625
When I came to pick you up,

2343
02:05:54,666 --> 02:05:57,041
something happened there.

2344
02:05:57,083 --> 02:05:58,333
What?

2345
02:06:05,416 --> 02:06:06,916
I see...

2346
02:06:07,541 --> 02:06:09,416
So, I didn't leave the group.

2347
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,333
They kicked me out, right?

2348
02:06:14,333 --> 02:06:16,666
To go on that trip, you said.

2349
02:06:16,708 --> 02:06:19,125
Not exactly.

2350
02:06:19,166 --> 02:06:23,250
They just got dazzled by
the offer.

2351
02:06:23,291 --> 02:06:25,583
When Nandan told me about it,

2352
02:06:25,625 --> 02:06:28,208
I felt like beating his brains out.

2353
02:06:29,375 --> 02:06:31,875
Then I thought over it.

2354
02:06:31,916 --> 02:06:37,041
When a driver, or a plumber,
or a gas-station worker...

2355
02:06:37,041 --> 02:06:39,875
is hit with such a huge offer-

2356
02:06:39,916 --> 02:06:43,125
How else would they react?

2357
02:06:45,625 --> 02:06:47,833
What is the Chef thinking?

2358
02:06:49,041 --> 02:06:51,041
I...

2359
02:06:51,083 --> 02:06:52,500
But I'm sure of one thing.

2360
02:06:52,541 --> 02:06:57,750
If we're going on this trip,
we won't go without you.

2361
02:06:57,791 --> 02:06:59,708
I'm sure of that.

2362
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:16,875
What is it?

2363
02:07:32,875 --> 02:07:34,375
Anjali.

2364
02:07:39,458 --> 02:07:41,125
Anjali!

2365
02:07:43,375 --> 02:07:45,666
All because I showed the
screengrab at that time.

2366
02:07:45,708 --> 02:07:48,333
That was the twist in the tale.

2367
02:07:48,375 --> 02:07:50,333
I have a request to make you all.

2368
02:07:50,375 --> 02:07:52,250
Hari mustn't be told anything.

2369
02:07:52,250 --> 02:07:53,708
At least, till we finish the tour.

2370
02:07:53,750 --> 02:07:55,583
Not just Hari, no one should know.

2371
02:07:55,583 --> 02:07:57,958
How can you take things so lightly?

2372
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:00,416
She could be at the police station.

2373
02:08:00,416 --> 02:08:02,000
You guys have no clue about
girls these days.

2374
02:08:02,041 --> 02:08:04,000
Let her go to the police.

2375
02:08:04,041 --> 02:08:05,458
We'll deal with it.

2376
02:08:05,458 --> 02:08:07,375
She hasn't seen the person.

2377
02:08:07,416 --> 02:08:08,541
On top of that, she was drunk.

2378
02:08:08,583 --> 02:08:11,041
And the only proof she had
was that key.

2379
02:08:11,083 --> 02:08:12,875
She left that on the table right here.

2380
02:08:12,916 --> 02:08:16,708
Sanosh, don't worry about the CCTV.

2381
02:08:16,750 --> 02:08:20,416
I called them. They don't
have CCTV.

2382
02:08:20,458 --> 02:08:22,291
I must say this.

2383
02:08:22,291 --> 02:08:25,291
We are the worst buggers.

2384
02:08:25,333 --> 02:08:26,958
I think everything she said
was true.

2385
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:29,458
Either Hari or someone from
our group groped her.

2386
02:08:29,500 --> 02:08:30,791
No doubt about that.

2387
02:08:30,833 --> 02:08:32,458
Then, it must be you.

2388
02:08:32,458 --> 02:08:34,625
Nonsense!

2389
02:08:34,625 --> 02:08:37,541
Madan, you have any intention
of calling Hari?

2390
02:08:38,375 --> 02:08:41,791
You walk towards the dead guy...

2391
02:08:41,833 --> 02:08:44,875
You take off your hat,
you kneel.

2392
02:08:44,916 --> 02:08:46,583
It's an aerial shot.

2393
02:08:46,625 --> 02:08:49,041
That's the film's interval point.

2394
02:08:49,041 --> 02:08:50,333
Sir.

2395
02:08:50,333 --> 02:08:52,875
- Time for the shot?
- No. It's Madan.

2396
02:08:52,875 --> 02:08:55,541
- Is this okay?
- It's good.

2397
02:08:55,583 --> 02:08:58,791
- You should've hung up.
- He kept calling.

2398
02:08:58,833 --> 02:08:59,916
Answer the call, Hari.

2399
02:08:59,958 --> 02:09:01,958
He has been calling
for some time.

2400
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:04,916
You were disturbed even
when he called earlier.

2401
02:09:04,916 --> 02:09:06,875
No disturbance at all, sir.

2402
02:09:06,875 --> 02:09:09,125
Madan is from our drama team.

2403
02:09:11,291 --> 02:09:13,166
A few months back, Madan
calls me up one night

2404
02:09:13,166 --> 02:09:16,041
and says a friend from Australia...

2405
02:09:16,083 --> 02:09:19,000
has a plan to make me
the hero of his movie.

2406
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:21,500
And that I should come to
his hotel immediately.

2407
02:09:21,541 --> 02:09:23,750
I was far away, at my wife's house.

2408
02:09:23,750 --> 02:09:25,541
It was raining cats and dogs.

2409
02:09:25,583 --> 02:09:27,583
Yet I rushed over,

2410
02:09:28,833 --> 02:09:33,333
Playing the 'hero' is any actor's
dream. Isn't it?

2411
02:09:33,375 --> 02:09:35,166
But when I got to the hotel,

2412
02:09:35,208 --> 02:09:38,083
there was no friend, no
Australia. Nothing.

2413
02:09:38,125 --> 02:09:40,833
Madan was there,
drinking with his friends.

2414
02:09:40,875 --> 02:09:41,750
Oh.

2415
02:09:41,791 --> 02:09:43,041
He made a bet with them...

2416
02:09:43,041 --> 02:09:47,375
that he could bring a movie guy
anytime at his will.

2417
02:09:47,375 --> 02:09:49,708
I didn't say a word then.

2418
02:09:49,750 --> 02:09:52,000
But you don't forget
such things.

2419
02:09:52,041 --> 02:09:54,208
I paid him a visit this morning.

2420
02:09:54,208 --> 02:09:55,833
Good things come in threes.

2421
02:09:55,833 --> 02:09:57,000
Call him one last time.

2422
02:09:57,041 --> 02:09:58,041
I'll call.

2423
02:09:58,166 --> 02:10:01,208
Vinay, the farther you stand,
the more you're left out.

2424
02:10:02,458 --> 02:10:07,416
His eyes lit up when he heard
about Europe and the money.

2425
02:10:08,125 --> 02:10:09,333
Poor guy.

2426
02:10:09,333 --> 02:10:11,166
He lives off his wife's money.

2427
02:10:13,541 --> 02:10:14,916
There! He's calling again.

2428
02:10:15,375 --> 02:10:16,916
Put it on speaker phone.

2429
02:10:19,291 --> 02:10:21,166
Time to break the news, I guess.

2430
02:10:21,666 --> 02:10:22,958
Just a minute.

2431
02:10:26,208 --> 02:10:27,916
Hello. What's up?

2432
02:10:27,916 --> 02:10:29,291
Hey, Hari.

2433
02:10:29,333 --> 02:10:33,041
Shouldn't we go meet Sir tonight?

2434
02:10:33,208 --> 02:10:35,125
Meet Sir? Why?

2435
02:10:35,125 --> 02:10:38,375
To talk about the European trip?

2436
02:10:38,375 --> 02:10:44,000
How about we go to
Australia instead?

2437
02:10:44,541 --> 02:10:47,458
Then, we can meet your
producer friend,

2438
02:10:47,500 --> 02:10:49,833
who was to cast me as a hero.

2439
02:10:52,208 --> 02:10:54,541
Europe, it seems!

2440
02:10:54,541 --> 02:10:58,166
You thought I'd forgive
your 'producer prank'?

2441
02:10:58,208 --> 02:10:59,166
Listen...

2442
02:10:59,208 --> 02:11:00,583
Hope you haven't told the
others about the trip.

2443
02:11:00,666 --> 02:11:01,958
Don't. You'll just get humiliated.

2444
02:11:01,958 --> 02:11:04,333
You tricked me, and I tricked you.

2445
02:11:04,375 --> 02:11:06,291
Tit for tat!
We're even now.

2446
02:11:06,333 --> 02:11:09,041
Don't take it to heart.
Go to bed now.

2447
02:11:09,125 --> 02:11:10,958
Good night.

2448
02:11:11,833 --> 02:11:14,458
That was downright awful!

2449
02:11:14,458 --> 02:11:16,708
This is just fantastic!

2450
02:11:16,708 --> 02:11:18,541
We asked for it!

2451
02:11:18,583 --> 02:11:19,791
We really asked for it!

2452
02:11:19,791 --> 02:11:23,125
Great! We totally deserve it!

2453
02:11:23,333 --> 02:11:24,625
You deserved this!

2454
02:13:03,583 --> 02:13:08,916
Salim says he did it, because
I partied with you all.

2455
02:13:11,458 --> 02:13:14,500
I'm not ready for any
compromise.

2456
02:13:14,500 --> 02:13:16,000
Sophia!

2457
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:19,375
How could Kapil, who
was asleep

2458
02:13:19,375 --> 02:13:21,875
in my room at 2.12,
grope you?

2459
02:13:21,875 --> 02:13:23,583
Did he walk in his sleep?

2460
02:13:23,583 --> 02:13:25,875
Did we ever ask you for
any details?

2461
02:13:26,250 --> 02:13:30,125
As artists, can't we do better,
than firing Kapil?

2462
02:13:30,166 --> 02:13:33,333
How many times have I told
you not to get drunk?

2463
02:13:33,375 --> 02:13:35,083
Just swallow the story, whole.

2464
02:13:35,125 --> 02:13:37,500
Something tells me, that it
was a hallucination.

2465
02:13:39,250 --> 02:13:41,458
Sophia, you can leave, if
you want.

2466
02:13:41,500 --> 02:13:44,208
But don't complain that
no-one believed you.

2467
02:13:44,250 --> 02:13:47,000
I don't need to have a relationship
elsewhere.

2468
02:13:47,333 --> 02:13:48,875
I don't think anyone groped her.

2469
02:13:48,875 --> 02:13:52,000
This was all a drama, they
played to get Kapil out.

2470
02:13:55,750 --> 02:13:57,208
You don't have to believe
anything.

2471
02:13:58,416 --> 02:13:59,958
Do you think so, Alex?

2472
02:14:02,750 --> 02:14:05,958
First, you said, it was Kapil.

2473
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:07,083
We believed that.

2474
02:14:08,708 --> 02:14:11,125
Shouldn't we go meet
those foreigners?

2475
02:14:11,250 --> 02:14:13,250
To discuss the trip to America?

2476
02:14:31,708 --> 02:14:33,041
Sophia.

2477
02:14:34,125 --> 02:14:35,958
You shouldn't leave our group.

2478
02:14:36,833 --> 02:14:38,666
I did it.

2479
02:14:39,250 --> 02:14:41,125
I don't know what came
over me.

2480
02:14:41,666 --> 02:14:43,666
I had never thought of you
like that.

2481
02:14:44,541 --> 02:14:45,833
But...

2482
02:14:46,958 --> 02:14:48,375
I'm the one who did it.

2483
02:14:53,625 --> 02:14:55,750
- Have you told the others?
- No.

2484
02:14:55,791 --> 02:14:58,916
I'll tell everyone now that
I did it.

2485
02:14:59,958 --> 02:15:02,333
Don't you want to see me?

2486
02:15:08,416 --> 02:15:09,791
No.

2487
02:15:10,875 --> 02:15:12,500
I don't want to see you.

2488
02:15:13,500 --> 02:15:14,708
Go back.

2489
02:15:16,166 --> 02:15:17,916
Don't tell everyone.

2490
02:15:19,291 --> 02:15:20,708
No one should know anything.

2491
02:15:20,708 --> 02:15:21,875
No.

2492
02:15:21,916 --> 02:15:23,125
No, Sophia.

2493
02:15:23,125 --> 02:15:25,250
I can't live with the guilt
any more.

2494
02:15:25,250 --> 02:15:27,708
- You must see me.
- No!

2495
02:15:27,750 --> 02:15:30,541
I said, you may go!

2496
02:15:31,541 --> 02:15:33,250
I don't want to know who
you are.

2497
02:15:34,583 --> 02:15:38,958
For me - you and the other eleven
are one and the same.

2498
02:15:51,166 --> 02:15:55,000
I now invite the writer,
director and actor,

2499
02:15:55,041 --> 02:15:56,875
Anjali Balan onto the stage.

2500
02:15:56,875 --> 02:15:59,333
Let's welcome her with a big
round of applause.

2501
02:16:03,416 --> 02:16:05,291
Let Anjali speak now.

2502
02:16:05,750 --> 02:16:09,166
I think you can start by introducing
your team mates.

2503
02:16:12,208 --> 02:16:15,666
Thank you for being such a
wonderful audience.

2504
02:16:15,708 --> 02:16:20,083
I can't begin to tell you how
overwhelming it was to...

2505
02:16:20,125 --> 02:16:23,041
Write and direct this play.

2506
02:16:24,875 --> 02:16:27,875
Let me introduce my
12 teammates.

2507
02:16:29,041 --> 02:16:30,375
Althaf.

2508
02:16:33,583 --> 02:16:35,166
Aadil.

2509
02:16:37,541 --> 02:16:39,083
Akash.

2510
02:16:40,708 --> 02:16:41,875
Amal.

2511
02:16:44,458 --> 02:16:45,791
Adithyan.

2512
02:16:48,333 --> 02:16:49,833
Rajesh.

2513
02:16:52,041 --> 02:16:53,166
Sharath.

2514
02:16:55,416 --> 02:16:56,750
Vyshak.

2515
02:16:58,958 --> 02:17:00,333
Krishnajith.

2516
02:17:02,291 --> 02:17:03,833
Vipin.

2517
02:17:06,291 --> 02:17:07,500
And Jithin.
