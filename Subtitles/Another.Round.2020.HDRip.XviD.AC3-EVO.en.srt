1
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,958
What is youth?
A dream

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,500
What is love?
The content of the dream

3
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:39,083
- Ready for the Lake Race?
- Yeah!

4
00:00:39,125 --> 00:00:41,750
3, 2, 1... go!

5
00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:47,708
You must drink a full case
on the race around the lake.

6
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:50,250
One beer per person
at each bench.

7
00:00:57,541 --> 00:01:01,041
Each team has an umpire
who ensures the case is brought back.

8
00:01:01,083 --> 00:01:04,916
The umpire is not allowed
to drink the beers.

9
00:01:07,416 --> 00:01:11,500
If you vomit as a team,
one minute will be deducted.

10
00:01:11,541 --> 00:01:13,666
Wait, wait...

11
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,958
When you return to the bench,
you drink the last beer.

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,791
The winner gets the bottle deposits.

13
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:07,916
Take it down a notch.

14
00:02:09,208 --> 00:02:11,875
Show some consideration.

15
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:16,541
Get over here.

16
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:56,166
A film by
Thomas Vinterberg

17
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,291
They call him Fjonk.

18
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:13,791
Red hair, Thor's hammer necklace.
It was him and his friend.

19
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:17,083
- Where did he get the handcuffs?
- We don't know.

20
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:22,458
But he cuffed the poor ticket inspector
to a rail, and then they partied on.

21
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:26,750
It's okay to have fun,
but it's gone overboard.

22
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:32,250
Maybe we should have a zero-alcohol
policy all of next semester.

23
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:33,666
Right.

24
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:39,250
- How do they intend to uphold that?
- It's like shutting down the Freetown.

25
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:44,500
- Sune, you'll do the warm-up today.
- Yes.

26
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:49,500
- Come.
- Okay. Follow me. Let's go.

27
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:54,250
Speed it up.

28
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:59,666
- No cutting corners.
- Right...

29
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:06,541
Looking good.

30
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:18,541
Open to the page of

31
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:29,250
'In Denmark I Was Born'.
Open your books. Come on.

32
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:34,833
Let's hear how rusty you are.
Yes.

33
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:42,458
<i>In Denmark I was born,
here my home is...</i>

34
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:46,083
What is psychology?

35
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:50,041
Can anyone tell me what psychology is?

36
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:56,333
Psychology is the scientific study
of human psychological processes -

37
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:59,541
- which is what we'll work on
the coming year.

38
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:03,500
Why do we behave, experience
and react as we do?

39
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:15,791
And the Industrial Age
is the period in world history -

40
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:19,375
- when Western societies -

41
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:23,125
- based on
their technological progress -

42
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:29,958
- started the process that created
the foundation for the modern world.

43
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:34,541
The invention of new technology...

44
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:37,750
Excuse me.
Weren't we talking about Churchill?

45
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:41,750
Yes, that's right.
Let's focus on that.

46
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:45,166
Churchill, the World War...
let's focus on that.

47
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:48,583
- World War 2?
- No, World War 1.

48
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:52,375
And thus... the Industrial Age.

49
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:58,833
- So, Churchill was First Lord of...
- This has gone bonkers.

50
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:04,208
Malthe, is there another lesson
you have to attend right now?

51
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:13,666
- Did you hand in your report?
- Yes.

52
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:18,625
- Did it feel good?
- It was okay.

53
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:32,708
Okay, I'm off.
I'm on nights all week.

54
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,958
- Anika?
- See you tomorrow.

55
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:39,291
Anika...

56
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:44,750
- Have I become boring?
- What do you mean?

57
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:48,541
Do you find me boring?

58
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:52,125
Compared to what?
When you were young or...?

59
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:54,250
Yes.

60
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:05,791
You're not the same Martin
I first met.

61
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:09,375
Right... okay.

62
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:25,875
Martin?

63
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:30,125
You have the seniors
in history, right?

64
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:32,125
Yes.

65
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:35,833
Uhm, they've tried to reach you
on school-intra.

66
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:41,125
They want to meet with you.
Are you available this afternoon?

67
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:43,708
Yes...

68
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,416
Sure, that's fine.

69
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:49,166
What's it about?

70
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:51,333
Just talk to them.

71
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:01,875
Oh, hi. I thought I'd just be meeting
with a couple of you.

72
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:06,375
We've gathered those of us
who could on such short notice.

73
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:09,458
Yes... well...

74
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,500
So, here I am.

75
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:17,958
Our children may be called upon
to do an exam in history with you.

76
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
- We need to talk about that.
- Of course.

77
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:29,250
There's great pressure -

78
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:33,541
- on the admittance requirements
to the universities they want to attend.

79
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:38,500
So it's not exactly good news
if they have to take an exam with you.

80
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:40,666
I see.

81
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:44,958
I need you to elaborate on that.

82
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:51,708
It's so uncomfortable to say this...
but a C+ really drags down your average.

83
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:55,416
It's History A,
so it counts double.

84
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:59,375
And you seem so indifferent...

85
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:04,541
No, I'm not indifferent.

86
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:11,875
It's not easy to learn when you've got
your head stuck in your phone.

87
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:14,583
Maybe you should...

88
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:25,208
But I'll take note of it
and try to work something out.

89
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:31,083
Whether that means another teacher or...

90
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:33,916
I'd like to say something.

91
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:37,208
What you said about
the Easter Crisis...

92
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:40,458
Totally confusing. Right?

93
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:55,625
Jonas! Please put back the bike
when you borrow it.

94
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:59,916
- But I didn't. Ask Kasper.
- I never touched it.

95
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:06,833
- Where are you going?
- To Nikolaj's 40th. Didn't I tell you?

96
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:10,250
Oh, right.
Fine.

97
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:16,708
It won't be late.
I'll take the car.

98
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,708
Okay.

99
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:30,083
- Anika, do you have a minute...
- Look, just stop it. There's pizza.

100
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:32,166
Just get one out.

101
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:35,166
- See you.
- See you later.

102
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:37,833
Bye, Martin!

103
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:43,458
Okay, I'm off now, boys.

104
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:46,541
Where are you going?

105
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:51,833
Out to dinner. Nikolaj's birthday.
Didn't I tell you?

106
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:54,708
Dunno.

107
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:57,375
It won't be late.

108
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:01,833
Mom's on night duty,
and there's pizza in the freezer.

109
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:06,583
- Hello? Pizza in the freezer.
- Sure.

110
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:32,333
Tommy?
So, are we leaving?

111
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:37,791
- Never saw you in a suit before.
- It's from the days with Mette.

112
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:40,166
The socks, too?

113
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:44,000
What?
Oh, right. No one'll notice.

114
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:48,750
How's she doing?
Mette.

115
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:51,166
Mette?

116
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:55,041
I don't know.

117
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:58,166
It has to pee.
It can hardly walk anymore.

118
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:00,791
There...

119
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:07,625
There, Laban.
That's right.

120
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:11,375
Yeah... there.
Have a little pee.

121
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:14,125
I just need to help it get started.

122
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:17,458
There, a little pee.

123
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:23,000
Good boy.

124
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:24,916
I'm driving. A soda, please.

125
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:27,958
- No lemon.
- No lemon, very well.

126
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,291
I have a bit of work to do
for tomorrow.

127
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:34,291
- The rest of us are having bubbles.
- Sounds great.

128
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:38,083
I have a champagne here from 2013.

129
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:41,500
There you go, a nice glass for you.

130
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:45,916
What characterizes this champagne
is the mineral notes.

131
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:50,791
If you close your eyes,
you'll envision ripe French fields.

132
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:55,708
- Damn, this is good.
- Draft beer and champagne.

133
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,541
Wait with the beer, okay?

134
00:12:57,583 --> 00:13:01,041
But how are you? You're 40 today!

135
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:04,875
Okay... How the hell am I?

136
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:08,666
I can't complain.
I have a beautiful wife -

137
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:12,416
- I live by the sea,
and she's loaded.

138
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:17,666
We have three kids who sleep in our bed
and pee on us every night.

139
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:20,833
- I never sleep anymore.
- Come on...

140
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:22,583
It's true.

141
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:26,708
Let's shelf that for a second
and say congratulations and cheers.

142
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:29,708
- Cheers.
- Martin, this is great.

143
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,833
- Too bad you're so sensible.
- Cheers.

144
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:35,916
It is, but the question is
what's sensible.

145
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:38,791
More nonsense from you?

146
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:41,791
Yes.
I mean, it's not from me as such.

147
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:46,583
There's this Norwegian philosopher
and psychiatrist, Finn Skårderud...

148
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:51,708
- You're so lame.
- Look. He thinks it's sensible to drink.

149
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:55,291
- When you drive?
- All the time.

150
00:13:55,333 --> 00:14:01,083
He claims humans are born with a blood
alcohol content that's 0.05% too low.

151
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:04,666
- Okay.
- But it's interesting.

152
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:09,541
Just to be clear... So 0.05%...
How much is 0.05%?

153
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:15,416
1-2 glasses of wine, and
you should maintain it at that level.

154
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:18,541
So you should just keep drinking?

155
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:25,041
Yes. His claim is that
when you have a 0.05% BAC -

156
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:28,291
- you're more relaxed -

157
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:31,458
- and poised -

158
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:35,208
- and musical and open.

159
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,208
More courageous in general.

160
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:42,458
I could use a little more
self-confidence and spirit.

161
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:48,791
We all could. And isn't that what
you struggle with at school, Martin?

162
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:51,916
- What?
- The problem in your class.

163
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:53,833
Peter mentioned...

164
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:57,791
I just mentioned the school situation.

165
00:14:58,541 --> 00:14:59,833
Okay.

166
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:06,208
- Listen, not to stick my nose in...
- Don't worry about it. It's fine.

167
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:11,333
But I don't know...
whether those things are related?

168
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:21,291
- Those kids just need to behave.
- Totally. A kick in the butt.

169
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:24,708
- Exactly.
- Martin, you're the man in charge.

170
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:28,125
Bury them in homework
and assignments and whatnot!

171
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:31,083
Paper, boom. Curriculum, boom.

172
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:34,125
Finished off with a talking-to.
They like it.

173
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:36,875
Right, Nikolaj?

174
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:43,166
I think it's about something else.
I think it's a bit bigger than that.

175
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:48,125
I think your problem with the class
is more banal.

176
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:53,000
I think you lack self-confidence.
And joy.

177
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:57,083
- I think that's what it's about.
- Okay.

178
00:15:57,125 --> 00:16:00,916
If I may interrupt?
We'll now serve the caviar.

179
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:05,208
Tonight we will serve
a Baerii caviar.

180
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:09,291
It's from Northern Europe,
locally harvested in Germany.

181
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:14,791
- We usually serve a vodka...
- And you'll also do that today.

182
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:18,250
This vodka would put
a smile on the Tsar's face.

183
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:22,875
It's an Imperia from Russia,
wheat-fermented and cooled -

184
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:29,958
- which crystallizes the water, giving
the vodka a velvety and rich texture.

185
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,875
That'll take us above the 0.05%.
Tommy?

186
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:36,458
- Thank you.
- There you go.

187
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:40,458
- I'll take the vodka...
- No, leave the bottle!

188
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:44,125
- Can you feel it...
- Jeez!

189
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:46,666
It's entering your blood stream.

190
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:51,375
You feel all warm inside as it spreads.
It has quite a punch.

191
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:56,750
Martin, come on. Russia was built
by people who drink vodka and drive.

192
00:16:56,791 --> 00:17:01,958
Grab some caviar and vodka.
You can drive home in a couple of hours.

193
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,416
No need to get worked up over that.

194
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:06,750
Cheers.

195
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:10,791
- Cheers.
- Listen... This is...

196
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:14,666
- This is amazing.
- This is great.

197
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:17,333
I told you! You and your beer.

198
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:20,583
I prefer draft beer.
What's wrong with that?

199
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:24,000
Nothing, but it's his 40th...

200
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:21,208
We've arrived at the main course.
Should we take a look at wines?

201
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:27,083
Yes, let's. We'll have a really, really,
really good glass of wine for Martin.

202
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:31,666
I have for you a Jérome Chezeaux,
a friend of the house.

203
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:34,916
A wine from the Burgundy district.
2011.

204
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:40,000
And as Robert Parker writes
in his 95-point rating -

205
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:45,083
- this wine encapsulates
the Burgundy spirit.

206
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:53,750
Thank you. I think we could use
a refill over there.

207
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:56,833
- Is it good?
- Very.

208
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:03,833
- There you go.
- Thank you.

209
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:10,000
Martin, what's up?
What going on?

210
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:19,375
Not much.

211
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:27,000
I don't do much.
I don't see many people.

212
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:33,708
How are you and Anika doing?

213
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:39,416
She works nights a lot, so...

214
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:44,333
I don't see her much either.

215
00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:00,666
There, there...
Take it easy, Martin.

216
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:05,166
I don't know how I ended up like this.

217
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:07,625
- I'm sorry.
- Don't worry about it.

218
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:15,875
- Have you considered someone else?
- No, I haven't.

219
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:21,833
She is... the mother of my children.

220
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:27,166
And she looked after my dad
when he died.

221
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:36,250
The plan was to hold
each other's hands when we get old.

222
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:42,666
We'll just have to see.

223
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:49,458
I'm sorry.

224
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:56,666
Martin, 12 years ago, when I came
to the school, you were a big man -

225
00:20:56,708 --> 00:21:01,041
- heading for a research position.
We were all talking about you.

226
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:05,208
You had a grant and a PhD
all lined up, damn it!

227
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:12,000
- You did apply, didn't you?
- No. The kids were little and...

228
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:16,916
- I already told you all this, Tommy.
- Right. You did.

229
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:25,833
When I met him,
he was just a little shit.

230
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:31,416
Roaming the streets in jeans
acting tough as all hell.

231
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:36,083
- And he took dancing lessons...
- Seriously?

232
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:41,083
- Dancing lessons? Was it ballet?
- Hey! It was jazz ballet.

233
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:44,250
- Jazz ballet, give me a fucking break.
- I did.

234
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:48,041
You took jazz ballet lessons...
So how's that going?

235
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:51,333
Shut up, some people
take up pottery.

236
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:57,125
He was out of this world.
It was totally professional.

237
00:21:57,166 --> 00:22:01,708
Hey, hey, hey!
Martin, you're a beautiful man.

238
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:05,750
And you can dance.
Not bad. Let's see it.

239
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:09,375
It was crazy when you did the...

240
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:14,458
Go on, show us.

241
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:18,458
One time. One.
On the floor.

242
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:22,166
- Oh, I did my back in.
- Come on, Martin!

243
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:26,666
- Come on, show us something.
- Tommy, you know all the moves.

244
00:22:26,708 --> 00:22:30,250
- Show it again.
- Do it yourself, man!

245
00:22:30,291 --> 00:22:32,458
What the hell, okay.

246
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:37,250
It was something like... and down
and like this!

247
00:22:37,291 --> 00:22:42,125
- Boom! Never saw it coming! Thank you.
- Cheers!

248
00:22:43,208 --> 00:22:46,041
Let's go!

249
00:22:46,083 --> 00:22:49,750
- No running!
- Martin, you're lifting...

250
00:22:49,791 --> 00:22:52,666
No running!

251
00:22:52,708 --> 00:22:55,625
- One foot on the ground at all times!
- Like this.

252
00:22:57,541 --> 00:22:59,750
1, 2, 3...

253
00:23:02,208 --> 00:23:06,833
- Hey! I didn't know what it was about!
- Next!

254
00:23:06,875 --> 00:23:12,041
- You're twice his weight!
- Next. Come on.

255
00:23:12,083 --> 00:23:14,041
1, 2, 3...

256
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,833
Get him down!
Get him down!

257
00:24:07,708 --> 00:24:10,250
- Hi.
- Hi.

258
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:12,458
Hello there.

259
00:25:22,541 --> 00:25:26,500
Okay, so I've gone over
the curriculum...

260
00:25:29,833 --> 00:25:34,375
Hello! Concentrate, please.
Good.

261
00:25:34,416 --> 00:25:40,500
I've gone over our curriculum, and we've
been through the historic challenges -

262
00:25:40,541 --> 00:25:43,208
- of the in... indru...

263
00:25:44,666 --> 00:25:46,083
... indrusti...

264
00:25:47,041 --> 00:25:51,666
... caused by the industrialization.

265
00:25:51,708 --> 00:25:55,916
So let's go over
the curriculum together -

266
00:25:55,958 --> 00:25:59,166
- and get an overview of it.

267
00:26:05,791 --> 00:26:07,875
Martin!

268
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:15,250
Thanks for the other day.
What a night!

269
00:26:18,416 --> 00:26:21,000
What are you doing?

270
00:26:21,041 --> 00:26:22,666
I can't drive.

271
00:26:27,875 --> 00:26:31,583
It was 0.05%, right?
Just wanted to try it out.

272
00:26:35,208 --> 00:26:40,416
- Hi, honey. I'm taking Martin home.<i>
- Why?</i>

273
00:26:40,458 --> 00:26:43,750
- Hi, Amalie.
- He can't drive...

274
00:26:44,833 --> 00:26:48,541
His car's in the shop,
so I'm giving him a lift.

275
00:26:48,583 --> 00:26:52,541
<i>But we need milk,
toilet paper, diapers -</i>

276
00:26:52,583 --> 00:26:57,166
<i>- and straw for the rabbit cage.
Okay?</i>

277
00:26:57,208 --> 00:26:59,666
Copy that.
Kisses, honey. Bye.

278
00:27:03,208 --> 00:27:06,541
- Call the guys.
- I just wanted to try it.

279
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:10,666
There's a bigger perspective here.
Call Tommy.

280
00:27:11,333 --> 00:27:13,541
We're on our way.

281
00:27:13,583 --> 00:27:17,666
- Because Nikolaj has lost his mind.
- No!

282
00:27:17,708 --> 00:27:22,833
Martin is a brave man who's decided
he wants to do something with his life!

283
00:27:22,875 --> 00:27:25,458
We're coming now.
He hung up.

284
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:28,416
- What the hell?
- Calm down.

285
00:27:28,458 --> 00:27:34,750
I just took a couple of sips, leaned
back and felt what that was like.

286
00:27:34,791 --> 00:27:39,958
- So let's have a drink?
- No. So how was the class?

287
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:45,666
Well... I had
some verbal motor challenges.

288
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:49,416
So basically -

289
00:27:49,458 --> 00:27:54,458
- we're testing out
the Skårderud hypothesis.

290
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:57,375
- Collecting evidence.
- Exactly.

291
00:27:57,416 --> 00:28:00,708
What if you get so wasted
you can't talk?

292
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:03,250
I had no problem talking.

293
00:28:03,291 --> 00:28:09,041
We're not the first people in the world
to drink a little alcohol during the day.

294
00:28:09,083 --> 00:28:13,958
Hemingway, for instance, he drank every
day until 8 p.m., and then stopped -

295
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,416
- so that he was fit to write the
next day. And his work was masterful.

296
00:28:18,458 --> 00:28:23,500
So if we're doing this,
I guess that'll be our approach.

297
00:28:23,541 --> 00:28:26,875
I think it's exciting.

298
00:28:28,208 --> 00:28:30,416
So do I.

299
00:28:34,416 --> 00:28:39,125
But we'll write a brilliant
psychological essay about it -

300
00:28:39,166 --> 00:28:42,041
- so that it isn't altogether
foolishness.

301
00:28:43,166 --> 00:28:45,916
- Okay.
- What do we write?

302
00:28:45,958 --> 00:28:49,166
A study of
Finn Skårderud's hypothesis -

303
00:28:49,208 --> 00:28:52,500
- that man is born with
a deficit of 0.05% BAC.

304
00:28:52,541 --> 00:28:56,166
And now what the trial will consist of.

305
00:28:56,208 --> 00:29:02,125
Daily consumption of alcohol
aspiring to uphold a level of 0.05%...

306
00:29:02,166 --> 00:29:06,916
With the aim of collecting evidence
of psychological -

307
00:29:06,958 --> 00:29:10,625
- verbal motor
and psycho-rhetorical effects -

308
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:16,416
- and study of increased
social and professional performance.

309
00:29:16,458 --> 00:29:20,041
- We only drink during work hours.
- Okay.

310
00:29:20,083 --> 00:29:23,083
It'll have to be.

311
00:29:23,125 --> 00:29:28,041
Like Hemingway. No drinking
after 8 p.m. or during the weekend.

312
00:29:37,833 --> 00:29:40,541
What...
Otto, for God's sake.

313
00:29:40,583 --> 00:29:44,250
Damn it... Otto.

314
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:50,250
Look! Damn it, Otto. You have
to speak up when you have to pee.

315
00:29:50,291 --> 00:29:55,541
- Mom, I peed!
- Shh! Not now. You'll wake them.

316
00:29:55,583 --> 00:30:00,750
Tell me before you pee. Not after.
And no yelling.

317
00:30:01,375 --> 00:30:03,500
Listen... telling me after...

318
00:30:03,541 --> 00:30:07,041
Why are you yelling?
I've slept all of 20 minutes!

319
00:30:07,083 --> 00:30:12,375
You're waking the whole house. I haven't
slept through the night in 3 years!

320
00:30:12,416 --> 00:30:16,041
- What's that?
- It's piss!

321
00:30:16,083 --> 00:30:21,333
- Why didn't he pee before bedtime?
- What an annoying thing to ask.

322
00:30:21,375 --> 00:30:27,916
- Do it yourself, if you're so clever.
- I intend to. Are you okay, sweetie?

323
00:30:29,041 --> 00:30:33,708
- Nikolaj, breakfast is ready!
- Coming. Start without me.

324
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:45,541
Nikolaj!

325
00:31:10,083 --> 00:31:15,875
Malthe, put your phone away unless
you want to share it with all of us?

326
00:31:15,916 --> 00:31:19,416
- Uhm, no.
- Fine. Put it away.

327
00:31:19,458 --> 00:31:22,041
And close the door.

328
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,166
We're having a test today.

329
00:31:31,208 --> 00:31:34,291
I'd like to see where we're at.

330
00:31:35,875 --> 00:31:39,708
- Josephine. Isn't your name Josephine?
- Yes.

331
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:43,500
The rest of you, pay attention.
What I'm about to talk about -

332
00:31:43,541 --> 00:31:48,250
- we've already been through this year,
or last year.

333
00:31:56,250 --> 00:32:02,541
Josse, there's an election with three
candidates, so who do you vote for?

334
00:32:02,583 --> 00:32:06,458
- Do you follow?
- Yes.

335
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:12,750
Number 1: He is partially paralyzed
from polio. He has hypertension.

336
00:32:12,791 --> 00:32:17,833
He's anemic and suffers from
an array of serious illnesses.

337
00:32:17,875 --> 00:32:24,833
He lies if it suits his purpose and
consults astrologists on his politics.

338
00:32:24,875 --> 00:32:29,666
He cheats on his wife, chain-smokes
and drinks too many martinis.

339
00:32:29,708 --> 00:32:35,333
Number 2: He's overweight,
and he's already lost three elections.

340
00:32:35,375 --> 00:32:39,583
He's had a depression
and two heart attacks.

341
00:32:39,625 --> 00:32:45,458
He's impossible to work with
and smokes cigars non-stop.

342
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:50,291
And every night when he goes to bed, he
drinks incredible amounts of champagne -

343
00:32:50,333 --> 00:32:55,916
- cognac, port, whisky and adds
two sleeping pills before dozing off.

344
00:32:55,958 --> 00:32:58,833
The last one, number 3:

345
00:32:58,875 --> 00:33:02,833
He's a highly decorated war hero.
He treats women with respect.

346
00:33:02,875 --> 00:33:08,958
He loves animals, never smokes
and only has a beer on rare occasions.

347
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,958
Josse, who do you vote for?

348
00:33:13,541 --> 00:33:17,500
- The last one.
- The last one. Number 3.

349
00:33:17,541 --> 00:33:20,833
- And the rest of you?
- Yes, number 3.

350
00:33:20,875 --> 00:33:24,666
Oh boy! You just discarded...

351
00:33:25,791 --> 00:33:29,041
... Franklin D. Roosevelt.

352
00:33:29,083 --> 00:33:35,708
Winston L. Churchill. And thankfully
you elected this guy.

353
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,458
Hitler?!

354
00:33:39,541 --> 00:33:46,541
Focus! It's funny, but there's a point
to this, which is important -

355
00:33:46,583 --> 00:33:49,958
- and which I hope
you'll understand some day.

356
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,833
The world is never as you expect.

357
00:33:55,541 --> 00:34:00,666
Oh, we'll be busy, but let's see
if we can't make this work.

358
00:34:00,708 --> 00:34:03,458
Jason, page 83.

359
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:07,083
<i>In Denmark I was born</i>

360
00:34:07,125 --> 00:34:10,583
<i>here my home is</i>

361
00:34:11,291 --> 00:34:15,041
<i>from there my roots...</i>

362
00:34:15,083 --> 00:34:18,333
Stop!
Stop, stop.

363
00:34:18,375 --> 00:34:24,500
It sounds like a Christmas party
at a swinger club. Come on.

364
00:34:24,541 --> 00:34:30,750
Klara, seriously. You sing divinely,
but it's not about me hearing you.

365
00:34:30,791 --> 00:34:34,791
It's about you listening to each other.

366
00:34:34,833 --> 00:34:37,208
Stand up.

367
00:34:38,791 --> 00:34:41,708
Close your eyes.

368
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:47,541
Try to be completely...

369
00:34:48,458 --> 00:34:50,416
... calm.

370
00:34:50,458 --> 00:34:54,000
And plant your feet -

371
00:34:54,041 --> 00:34:58,625
- solidly on the ground and...

372
00:35:07,541 --> 00:35:11,458
There! Open your eyes.

373
00:35:12,666 --> 00:35:15,500
Good morning.

374
00:35:17,416 --> 00:35:23,291
Now we will sing with our ears,
our hearts, with our souls.

375
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:28,375
And... hold hands for a second.

376
00:35:28,416 --> 00:35:31,916
Let the energy flow through you.

377
00:35:31,958 --> 00:35:35,291
There. Find the common pulse.

378
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:38,541
I'll give you the note.

379
00:35:41,583 --> 00:35:46,250
<i>In Denmark I was born</i>

380
00:35:46,291 --> 00:35:50,708
<i>here my home is</i>

381
00:35:51,791 --> 00:35:54,958
<i>from there my roots</i>

382
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:00,083
<i>and there my world extend.</i>

383
00:36:01,083 --> 00:36:06,833
<i>You windswept Danish strand</i>

384
00:36:06,875 --> 00:36:12,541
<i>where ancient chieftain's barrow</i>

385
00:36:12,583 --> 00:36:17,625
<i>stands close to apple orchard</i>

386
00:36:17,666 --> 00:36:22,125
<i>hop and mallow.</i>

387
00:36:22,166 --> 00:36:27,125
<i>Therefore you I love</i>

388
00:36:27,166 --> 00:36:35,625
<i>Denmark, my native land.</i>

389
00:36:47,541 --> 00:36:51,000
- So?
- There's something to it, huh?

390
00:36:51,041 --> 00:36:56,125
Definitely.
I was thinking you can sniff it.

391
00:36:56,166 --> 00:37:01,375
Then it won't be on your breath,
and I think it'll have greater effect.

392
00:37:01,416 --> 00:37:05,458
I don't know...
Don't forget to take notes.

393
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:09,208
- Tommy?
- I don't know where he is.

394
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:12,375
- Nikolaj, where's Tommy?
- He's off today. Coaching youngsters.

395
00:37:12,416 --> 00:37:15,916
Have some water,
and we'll get back to it.

396
00:37:17,333 --> 00:37:20,916
So, Specs, did your parents forget
to give you water again?

397
00:37:20,958 --> 00:37:23,250
Okay.

398
00:37:23,291 --> 00:37:26,041
No, you can't have this.

399
00:37:26,083 --> 00:37:30,208
Hjalte! Come here.
Give Specs a sip.

400
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:33,958
Why don't you give him a sip?

401
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,958
Listen, Hjalte, if you want to play
in the matches -

402
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,250
- you'll be a good sport
and give Specs a sip.

403
00:37:42,291 --> 00:37:48,750
If I'm to spend my spare time on you
little pissants, you better behave.

404
00:37:48,791 --> 00:37:52,833
Yeah! Spread out, play each other.

405
00:37:52,875 --> 00:37:54,916
Pay attention to each other!

406
00:37:56,500 --> 00:38:01,708
They're hard on you, huh, Specs?
Stay here with me, okay?

407
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:03,958
Yeah. Take a little break.

408
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,500
Great!

409
00:38:06,541 --> 00:38:08,875
And pass it back. Yes!

410
00:38:25,791 --> 00:38:29,083
- Hi.
- Hi.

411
00:38:29,125 --> 00:38:33,375
- You're drinking wine?
- I guess I am.

412
00:38:33,416 --> 00:38:37,041
- Did you sleep until now?
- Yes.

413
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:43,500
- Are the boys home for dinner?
- I don't really know.

414
00:38:43,541 --> 00:38:46,208
I'll make enough for the four of us.

415
00:38:49,541 --> 00:38:54,583
Can I get you anything?
Coffee? Wine? Both?

416
00:38:54,625 --> 00:38:58,458
- Coffee, please.
- Coffee.

417
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:02,416
- Jonas is almost as tall as me.
- Really?

418
00:39:02,458 --> 00:39:06,000
He's missing this much.
Don't tell him.

419
00:39:06,041 --> 00:39:11,041
He'll have to discover it himself.
He'll be out of control.

420
00:39:26,375 --> 00:39:31,625
- Have you talked about fall vacation?
- I think we'll just stay home.

421
00:39:31,666 --> 00:39:37,583
- Those of us who don't have plans.
- Or we could go canoeing.

422
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:40,291
- What?
- We've always done that.

423
00:39:40,333 --> 00:39:43,791
- Yes, eight years ago.
- Yes! It's been too long.

424
00:39:43,833 --> 00:39:48,708
The fresh air will do the boys good,
and maybe we should... What's up?

425
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:50,958
Nothing.

426
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:56,000
But I could ask you the same thing.
What's up with you?

427
00:39:56,041 --> 00:39:59,625
Nothing.
I just want to go on fall vacation.

428
00:40:25,458 --> 00:40:27,666
I'd better get ready.

429
00:41:05,666 --> 00:41:08,541
Hello?
Hey...

430
00:41:09,625 --> 00:41:12,541
- Hi, Tommy.
- Hi.

431
00:41:14,458 --> 00:41:18,250
- Look what I found.
- What the hell's that?

432
00:41:18,291 --> 00:41:19,958
Booze.

433
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:25,583
- Where the hell does that come from?
- Beats me.

434
00:41:25,625 --> 00:41:30,250
Not many teachers
have keys to this place.

435
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:35,208
I may have forgotten to lock up, but...
And there's a newspaper.

436
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:38,708
Let me see.
Yeah, you're right, dammit.

437
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:45,291
Someone's been having a nice time.
And look over here. A hip flask.

438
00:41:45,333 --> 00:41:50,333
- Mogens, did you inform the principal?
- No, not yet.

439
00:41:50,375 --> 00:41:53,875
- You didn't?
- No, not yet.

440
00:41:53,916 --> 00:41:56,875
And here's another one.

441
00:41:56,916 --> 00:42:02,000
Have any of you seen students
drinking on the school premises?

442
00:42:02,041 --> 00:42:05,625
During school hours.

443
00:42:05,666 --> 00:42:10,458
Some bottles were found
in the gym depot.

444
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:15,625
No? I don't assume anyone here has
a problem I should know about?

445
00:42:19,041 --> 00:42:22,458
- Phew!
- I'm sorry about the depot.

446
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:25,000
I didn't know anyone went there.

447
00:42:26,041 --> 00:42:29,666
- We have to be careful.
- Yeah.

448
00:42:32,291 --> 00:42:35,000
I haven't felt this good in ages.

449
00:42:35,041 --> 00:42:39,250
Something's happening.
Even when I'm sober.

450
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:46,333
I think there's more to this.
Maybe even going a bit higher.

451
00:42:52,916 --> 00:42:56,083
I think that's exciting.

452
00:42:56,125 --> 00:42:59,500
Peter, nobody found out.

453
00:42:59,541 --> 00:43:04,583
I haven't been teaching this well
in ages.

454
00:43:04,625 --> 00:43:07,750
I just know there's more to it.

455
00:43:07,791 --> 00:43:12,458
Something more unreserved?

456
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:16,583
Yes. We don't know if we'll react
the same way to the same BAC.

457
00:43:16,625 --> 00:43:19,166
True.

458
00:43:19,208 --> 00:43:24,666
Peter, you love Klaus Heerfordt.
He was a very gifted pianist.

459
00:43:24,708 --> 00:43:27,000
- Put him on, would you?
- Sure.

460
00:43:27,041 --> 00:43:33,666
He could only play at the exact point
of being neither drunk nor sober.

461
00:43:33,708 --> 00:43:36,708
And he was absolutely brilliant.

462
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:41,333
And you want to take this
to the Tchaikovsky level.

463
00:43:41,375 --> 00:43:43,916
Yes.

464
00:43:43,958 --> 00:43:50,166
But I don't know if we'll all react the
same way to the same BAC. Peter...

465
00:43:50,208 --> 00:43:53,958
- Let's have a drink and find out.
- Easy now.

466
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,750
- Are we or are we not alcoholics?
- We're not alcoholics.

467
00:43:58,791 --> 00:44:03,416
We decide when we want to drink.
An alcoholic can't help himself.

468
00:44:03,458 --> 00:44:08,375
Exactly. I give you Klaus Heerfordt
and one of his drinking buddies.

469
00:44:59,541 --> 00:45:01,375
It's huge.

470
00:45:01,416 --> 00:45:05,458
Well?
What do we write down?

471
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:07,833
Part 2.

472
00:45:07,875 --> 00:45:10,708
The Individual BAC.

473
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:17,541
A daily consumption of alcohol
at a variable and individual level -

474
00:45:17,583 --> 00:45:22,666
- in order to achieve optimal
professional and social performance -

475
00:45:22,708 --> 00:45:28,083
- and the ensuing collection of evidence
of psychological -

476
00:45:28,125 --> 00:45:31,791
- and psycho-rhetorical effects.

477
00:45:31,833 --> 00:45:34,541
Who goes first?

478
00:46:05,916 --> 00:46:09,958
Well... That's the question...

479
00:46:25,083 --> 00:46:26,750
Greetings...

480
00:46:26,791 --> 00:46:30,416
... dear, young friends.

481
00:46:30,458 --> 00:46:34,125
I wish all of you a Happy New Year.

482
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:39,250
See you.

483
00:46:39,291 --> 00:46:41,375
Bye, Martin.

484
00:48:05,208 --> 00:48:08,375
Churchill liked his alcohol...

485
00:48:28,208 --> 00:48:30,458
Thanks.

486
00:48:44,208 --> 00:48:46,125
Whoops!

487
00:48:49,583 --> 00:48:52,583
What the hell is going on?

488
00:48:56,416 --> 00:48:58,708
Mornin'.

489
00:49:03,666 --> 00:49:05,291
Oops.

490
00:49:07,916 --> 00:49:11,041
Martin, are you okay?

491
00:49:11,083 --> 00:49:16,458
I'll handle it.
It's just a nosebleed. There.

492
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:18,625
Martin, here we go.

493
00:49:18,666 --> 00:49:22,125
- Am I bleeding?
- We'll add some compression.

494
00:49:22,166 --> 00:49:26,625
You're bleeding a bit.
Yeah, there it is.

495
00:49:26,666 --> 00:49:30,541
Just stick it up there. Up.

496
00:49:35,250 --> 00:49:36,958
Cool.

497
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,708
Take that with you.

498
00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:42,833
No worries. He's fine.

499
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,625
Okay, let's do this.

500
00:50:00,666 --> 00:50:06,541
Can you guess what you have in common
with these three gentlemen?

501
00:50:07,333 --> 00:50:11,791
- Girls, too?
- Yes, the girls, too.

502
00:50:11,833 --> 00:50:16,625
And for those of you who've been asleep
for the past 18 years, this is:

503
00:50:16,666 --> 00:50:21,625
General Grant, Ernest Hemingway
and good old Winston Churchill.

504
00:50:21,666 --> 00:50:24,666
What do you have in common with them?

505
00:50:25,875 --> 00:50:30,833
You drink like pigs.
Every week, all year round.

506
00:50:30,875 --> 00:50:35,125
A lot of alcohol, so let me
ask you a few questions.

507
00:50:35,166 --> 00:50:39,750
Jason, you're a feisty one.
How much do you drink in a week?

508
00:50:41,375 --> 00:50:43,333
I don't know.

509
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:48,000
You can tell me, I won't tell anyone.

510
00:50:48,041 --> 00:50:53,958
National Board of Health recommends
max. 14 units for men and 7 for women.

511
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:58,708
Jason, Jason, Jason, do you drink more
or less than recommended?

512
00:50:58,750 --> 00:51:03,041
Well... I drink Thursday, Friday
and Saturday...

513
00:51:05,333 --> 00:51:07,083
... and a bit on Sunday.

514
00:51:07,125 --> 00:51:10,125
And Wednesday, if there's
a Champion's League game on.

515
00:51:10,166 --> 00:51:11,625
So how much?

516
00:51:11,666 --> 00:51:17,625
14-15 drinks Thursday, Friday, Saturday.
And 4-5 Sunday and Wednesday.

517
00:51:17,666 --> 00:51:23,458
- So how much is that in a week?
- In a good week 50-55.

518
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:26,875
- What was that?
- 55.

519
00:51:26,916 --> 00:51:32,416
55. Okay. Caro?
What are the rules of the Lake Race?

520
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:37,458
- Is the question understood?
- Yes.

521
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:43,208
You race around the lake and drink
a case of beer against the clock.

522
00:51:43,250 --> 00:51:46,541
- And if you vomit?
- As a team?

523
00:51:46,583 --> 00:51:48,291
There's a rule?

524
00:51:48,333 --> 00:51:51,791
You get a time deduction,
but if you vomit alone...

525
00:51:51,833 --> 00:51:55,375
They add time, got it.
Okay, show of hands.

526
00:51:55,416 --> 00:51:58,875
How many of you take part
in the Lake Race?

527
00:51:58,916 --> 00:52:01,750
Everyone.

528
00:52:01,791 --> 00:52:04,916
I swear, no one could tell.

529
00:52:04,958 --> 00:52:08,750
This is interesting because
we're talking about Churchill -

530
00:52:08,791 --> 00:52:13,333
- and besides writing 37 books
in 58 volumes -

531
00:52:13,375 --> 00:52:17,625
- painting over 500 paintings, receiving
the Nobel Prize in literature -

532
00:52:17,666 --> 00:52:23,500
- and winning WW2 as one of the world's
greatest commanders, he also said:

533
00:52:23,541 --> 00:52:28,250
"I never drink before breakfast."

534
00:52:28,291 --> 00:52:33,083
So, when you run around
totally wasted -

535
00:52:33,125 --> 00:52:38,166
- throwing up in bushes and alleys,
don't feel alone -

536
00:52:38,208 --> 00:52:40,958
- because you're in great company.

537
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,833
Grant, Hemingway and old Winston -

538
00:52:44,875 --> 00:52:50,875
- could kick your ass in the Lake Race.
But the question is:

539
00:52:50,916 --> 00:52:55,458
If you're to take a history exam, which
one of you ambitious youngsters -

540
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:58,625
- will flunk big time,
and who will pass?

541
00:52:58,666 --> 00:53:03,625
In other words, who will do as
Hemingway and blow his brains out -

542
00:53:03,666 --> 00:53:07,791
- and who will win a world war?

543
00:53:17,958 --> 00:53:21,750
Josse, help me out here.
You know all about D-Day, right?

544
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:24,708
To the board, go on.

545
00:53:26,208 --> 00:53:30,958
Give me three good reasons
for D-Day's success.

546
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,291
D-Day was the day -

547
00:53:34,333 --> 00:53:38,083
- the Allied Forces
landed on a French beach.

548
00:53:38,125 --> 00:53:43,541
- Yes, where?
- Normandy.

549
00:53:43,583 --> 00:53:47,625
- See you, Martin.
- See you.

550
00:53:50,666 --> 00:53:54,708
I've booked a canoe trip.

551
00:53:59,541 --> 00:54:02,291
Martin?
Martin...

552
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:09,041
- What level are you at?
- Around 0.1, I think.

553
00:54:10,125 --> 00:54:12,916
Fantastic.

554
00:54:21,416 --> 00:54:25,875
Nooooo :( Said yes to a shift.
Didn't think you meant it

555
00:54:29,833 --> 00:54:32,083
Seriously?

556
00:54:35,541 --> 00:54:38,833
Can't you change it?

557
00:54:42,416 --> 00:54:45,291
See you tomorrow.

558
00:55:46,416 --> 00:55:48,875
Sigrid... the quote.

559
00:55:50,708 --> 00:55:54,250
"To dare is
to lose one's footing momentarily."

560
00:55:54,291 --> 00:55:57,958
"Not to dare is to lose oneself."

561
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,958
Are you ready?

562
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,375
Stand up.

563
00:56:02,416 --> 00:56:07,083
Hand to your heart.
You too, Specs.

564
00:56:07,125 --> 00:56:11,416
<i>A lovely land is ours</i>

565
00:56:11,458 --> 00:56:15,916
<i>with beeches green about her</i>

566
00:56:15,958 --> 00:56:22,458
<i>encircled by the sea
encircled by the sea.</i>

567
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:25,250
Off you go!

568
00:56:26,333 --> 00:56:27,708
Hjalte!

569
00:56:27,750 --> 00:56:30,500
Boys!
I'm busy over here.

570
00:56:30,541 --> 00:56:33,708
Finish up already!
Hjalte! Finish it!

571
00:56:34,458 --> 00:56:38,708
Goddammit!
Come again.

572
00:56:42,416 --> 00:56:45,291
Pass to Huxi!

573
00:56:45,333 --> 00:56:46,583
Hjalte, nice pass.

574
00:56:53,916 --> 00:56:57,166
Okay, listen up, boys.

575
00:56:57,208 --> 00:57:00,583
Hjalte! Pass the ball to Kasper.

576
00:57:00,625 --> 00:57:04,416
Go on! Run!
Huxi, pass to Bror!

577
00:57:04,458 --> 00:57:08,583
Pass to Specs now!
That's right!

578
00:57:08,625 --> 00:57:11,458
Run, Specs!
Come on!

579
00:57:27,125 --> 00:57:28,833
Awesome!

580
00:57:43,333 --> 00:57:46,083
Tommy!
You're the best coach in the world!

581
00:57:48,125 --> 00:57:51,125
A sliding tackle!

582
00:57:51,166 --> 00:57:54,333
You can totally do
a sliding tackle on this!

583
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:00,625
- Is that allowed?
- Sliding tackle!

584
00:58:00,666 --> 00:58:03,375
Sliding tackle.

585
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:08,458
Are you afraid of my sliding tackle?

586
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:10,500
Take this! Yes!

587
00:58:18,541 --> 00:58:23,583
I wish I had a couple of kids
running around in the garden.

588
00:58:25,208 --> 00:58:27,333
I'd have liked that.

589
00:58:28,125 --> 00:58:33,416
But you get all wound up and start
tidying up whenever you meet a woman.

590
00:58:34,250 --> 00:58:39,166
- Just calm the fuck down.
- That won't get me any kids, Tommy.

591
00:58:40,916 --> 00:58:45,333
You've got your students.
They're gonna remember you forever.

592
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:50,166
They're gonna forget all about us
the moment they're out the door.

593
00:59:03,750 --> 00:59:06,208
Hi, Sebastian.

594
00:59:15,875 --> 00:59:18,875
Hey. Are you okay?

595
00:59:18,916 --> 00:59:22,083
Yeah, I was just studying.

596
00:59:22,125 --> 00:59:27,708
I may not teach psychology,
but you sure don't look okay.

597
00:59:27,750 --> 00:59:30,083
What's going on?

598
00:59:31,666 --> 00:59:34,291
- Love troubles?
- What?

599
00:59:35,958 --> 00:59:40,666
I've had my heart broken
a couple of times.

600
00:59:40,708 --> 00:59:42,791
Sit down.

601
00:59:43,583 --> 00:59:48,000
- But know this about girls...
- Peter, it's not that.

602
00:59:49,750 --> 00:59:53,083
- What, then?
- All this.

603
00:59:56,250 --> 00:59:59,541
School, homework, grades...

604
01:00:01,250 --> 01:00:05,958
- I broke down during exams last year.
- You're worried about exams already?

605
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:09,208
I have to be.
I can't repeat another year.

606
01:00:09,250 --> 01:00:11,291
Hey...

607
01:00:15,708 --> 01:00:18,000
It's horrible being here again.

608
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:25,833
As long as I get a B+ average,
I can get into medical school.

609
01:00:26,666 --> 01:00:29,291
But right now I'll be lucky to pass.

610
01:00:36,791 --> 01:00:40,666
Ever considered having a drink
before the exam?

611
01:00:40,708 --> 01:00:43,791
- What?
- Just a shot.

612
01:00:43,833 --> 01:00:48,041
Or maybe two,
to take the edge off your anxiety -

613
01:00:48,083 --> 01:00:50,166
- and to loosen your tongue.

614
01:00:50,208 --> 01:00:54,500
I know it sounds crazy,
but I won't tell anyone.

615
01:00:54,541 --> 01:00:59,666
- Go! We're way too close.
- Come on!

616
01:00:59,708 --> 01:01:03,541
- Well done, Mom.
- They're falling apart in boat 1.

617
01:01:04,666 --> 01:01:08,166
- We weren't ready!
- Go, go, go!

618
01:01:08,833 --> 01:01:13,000
- This is nice.
- That one over there, it's flat.

619
01:01:13,750 --> 01:01:16,333
- Are we there?
- Sure, just a bit lopsided.

620
01:01:19,041 --> 01:01:23,958
- Want us to carry some of your load?
- Stop gloating, Martin.

621
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,583
Want me to grab the water?

622
01:01:31,625 --> 01:01:34,000
Put it in here.

623
01:01:34,041 --> 01:01:36,708
- In here?
- Yes, just...

624
01:01:36,750 --> 01:01:42,541
Oh no.
I want another partner.

625
01:01:42,583 --> 01:01:47,833
- Why do you and Mom get the big tent?
- And why are we so deep in the woods?

626
01:01:47,875 --> 01:01:50,625
- Yessir!
- Yes!

627
01:01:50,666 --> 01:01:54,250
- Does it live in Africa?
- No.

628
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:00,958
- Does it live in...
- Is it a...

629
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:05,541
- Don't skip my turn.
- We're in for a long night.

630
01:02:05,583 --> 01:02:09,583
- Is it a sea cow?
- A what?

631
01:02:09,625 --> 01:02:13,000
- You're supposed to narrow it down.
- I am.

632
01:02:13,041 --> 01:02:16,375
Does it live in the Swedish woods?

633
01:02:18,125 --> 01:02:21,666
- Does it live on the savannah?
- No.

634
01:02:21,708 --> 01:02:24,125
It doesn't live on the savannah.

635
01:02:24,166 --> 01:02:27,291
If it doesn't live on the savannah
nor in the Swedish woods -

636
01:02:27,333 --> 01:02:31,000
- it must be a cuckoo.
A cuckoo.

637
01:02:31,041 --> 01:02:35,583
- A cookie?
- A cuckoo. It's a bird.

638
01:02:35,625 --> 01:02:37,916
- Is that it?
- No.

639
01:02:38,833 --> 01:02:42,083
- You're supposed to narrow it down.
- Don't you get it?

640
01:02:42,125 --> 01:02:45,208
- I get it!
- Does it live in the water?

641
01:02:45,250 --> 01:02:49,291
Each time I ask,
I have one option less the next time.

642
01:02:49,333 --> 01:02:54,000
So now you're down
to 1,224,000,000 animals.

643
01:02:54,041 --> 01:02:57,208
- Come on, Kasper.
- A salmon.

644
01:03:22,958 --> 01:03:24,916
What's happening?

645
01:03:30,375 --> 01:03:32,208
- Are you crying?
- Yes.

646
01:03:32,250 --> 01:03:34,166
Why?

647
01:03:35,875 --> 01:03:39,291
I think I've missed you, that's all.

648
01:03:49,833 --> 01:03:51,833
Me too.

649
01:04:07,875 --> 01:04:10,125
I've missed us.

650
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:14,541
For a long time.

651
01:04:19,333 --> 01:04:21,875
Maybe too long.

652
01:04:43,166 --> 01:04:47,791
What do you have in store for us?
Are we having a drink first?

653
01:04:47,833 --> 01:04:51,625
I spoke to a senior psychologist
at a leading hospital -

654
01:04:51,666 --> 01:04:56,375
- about a chapter he entitled
'Harmful Consumption of Alcohol'.

655
01:04:56,416 --> 01:04:59,083
- For a longer period of time.
- So you want us to stop?

656
01:04:59,125 --> 01:05:05,125
No. I'd like for us to examine
the entire spectrum of alcohol.

657
01:05:05,166 --> 01:05:07,750
I mean, if we're to do a report?

658
01:05:07,791 --> 01:05:10,791
Skårderud talks about 'ignition'.

659
01:05:10,833 --> 01:05:14,125
After 7-10 units -

660
01:05:14,166 --> 01:05:18,166
- you either get tired and go home -

661
01:05:18,208 --> 01:05:23,333
- or you get a restless mouth:
The more you get, the more you want.

662
01:05:23,375 --> 01:05:26,000
You want to drink anything all the time.

663
01:05:26,041 --> 01:05:30,000
I'd like for us to drink
to the point of ignition...

664
01:05:30,791 --> 01:05:33,916
... and beyond.

665
01:05:33,958 --> 01:05:37,833
I'm talking about
the ultimate catharsis.

666
01:05:37,875 --> 01:05:40,125
Total oblivion.

667
01:05:40,166 --> 01:05:43,500
- I think I'm getting off here, boys.
- Really?

668
01:05:43,541 --> 01:05:48,208
I think it's time to get back
to my family.

669
01:05:48,250 --> 01:05:50,125
I'm game.

670
01:05:51,208 --> 01:05:56,583
- What are you up to? Are you drunk?
- No, we're not.

671
01:05:56,625 --> 01:05:58,333
- Sure?
- Yes.

672
01:05:58,375 --> 01:06:02,458
We're off to capoeira
and then to my Dad's -

673
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:06,333
- while you goof off
or whatever the hell you do.

674
01:06:06,375 --> 01:06:09,291
Remember to shop for tomorrow.
Fresh codfish.

675
01:06:09,333 --> 01:06:11,500
- Sure.
- Fresh cod.

676
01:06:11,541 --> 01:06:14,916
Fresh cod it is. Bye, kids.

677
01:06:14,958 --> 01:06:17,291
Have fun at capoeira.

678
01:06:18,250 --> 01:06:20,916
- Fresh cod.
- Fresh cod.

679
01:06:22,166 --> 01:06:25,458
- Coming, Tommy?
- Yes.

680
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:29,708
- Have we got everything? Booze?
- It's all in here.

681
01:06:29,750 --> 01:06:34,083
We'll start with this.
Peychaud's bitters.

682
01:06:34,125 --> 01:06:37,166
- Alcohol-free?
- It's all alcohol!

683
01:06:37,208 --> 01:06:40,541
Seven, eight...
Add four lumps of sugar.

684
01:06:40,583 --> 01:06:44,750
- Got it.
- Crush them. We need some ice.

685
01:06:44,791 --> 01:06:48,000
- This is all very elaborate, isn't it?
- No.

686
01:06:48,041 --> 01:06:50,875
We might as well drink
surgical spirit, then.

687
01:06:50,916 --> 01:06:56,291
- What are you having?
- Sazerac. 5 cl bourbon, 1 cl absinthe.

688
01:06:56,333 --> 01:06:59,375
The jazz musicians in New Orleans
created it -

689
01:06:59,416 --> 01:07:02,166
- to look like a watered-down cocktail.

690
01:07:02,208 --> 01:07:05,666
But it's <i>pure</i> alcohol.
I mean, it's...

691
01:07:05,708 --> 01:07:09,708
- Why do you rotate the glass?
- To coat it with absinthe.

692
01:07:09,750 --> 01:07:12,000
Then add this.

693
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:17,333
And now for the magic touch.
Hand me the orange.

694
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:22,875
You cut off a slice.
The peel contains a fragrant oil.

695
01:07:22,916 --> 01:07:26,416
- I don't need it.
- Oh yes. Just rub it on the edge.

696
01:07:26,458 --> 01:07:29,916
- Smell that.
- I'll grab that. Is it all done?

697
01:07:29,958 --> 01:07:34,333
Hey, wait for the rest of us.
Cheers.

698
01:07:38,625 --> 01:07:40,458
Holy crap!

699
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:43,541
Well, what are we gonna write?

700
01:07:43,583 --> 01:07:45,541
Part 3.

701
01:07:49,958 --> 01:07:52,125
The maximum BAC.

702
01:07:52,166 --> 01:07:57,666
Study of high alcohol intake
aspiring to reach maximum level -

703
01:07:57,708 --> 01:08:00,416
- with special focus
on observation of -

704
01:08:00,458 --> 01:08:04,500
- emancipating psychological effects.

705
01:08:04,541 --> 01:08:07,208
The study is conducted in private -

706
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:11,375
- to avoid negative interference
from and with the surroundings.

707
01:08:11,416 --> 01:08:15,250
- Here's another round.
- Martin, don't you want a drink?

708
01:08:15,291 --> 01:08:18,375
- I'll pass.
- Don't you want a drink?

709
01:08:18,416 --> 01:08:20,041
There you go.

710
01:08:24,083 --> 01:08:26,250
- See you.
- Cheers.

711
01:08:27,708 --> 01:08:32,333
Holy crap.
I've never tasted anything like it.

712
01:08:33,916 --> 01:08:35,500
Holy crap.

713
01:08:35,541 --> 01:08:39,416
- It's fucking strong.
- But also, good.

714
01:08:41,041 --> 01:08:43,458
Are you sure about that, Martin?

715
01:08:46,166 --> 01:08:47,875
There you go.

716
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:52,416
Holy crap. What is this?

717
01:08:52,458 --> 01:08:54,541
Cheers!

718
01:08:54,583 --> 01:08:56,250
Cheers.

719
01:09:35,208 --> 01:09:38,125
- How's the dancing?
- Gone to hell.

720
01:09:38,166 --> 01:09:39,541
Martin!

721
01:09:45,458 --> 01:09:47,166
There we go.

722
01:09:50,625 --> 01:09:52,125
Cheers!

723
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,916
Down, down, down.

724
01:10:29,958 --> 01:10:33,333
- I'm not downing it. Just a swig.
- Cheers.

725
01:10:34,458 --> 01:10:37,375
We need to go higher.
To the top!

726
01:10:59,250 --> 01:11:00,375
Martin.

727
01:11:07,041 --> 01:11:09,583
Where is the fresh codfish?

728
01:11:09,625 --> 01:11:13,291
I'm afraid we're out of fresh.
We've only got frozen.

729
01:11:13,333 --> 01:11:16,541
Why haven't you got fresh cod -

730
01:11:16,583 --> 01:11:21,208
- when all months with an R in them
are cod months?!

731
01:11:21,250 --> 01:11:23,375
Well, it may be in season...

732
01:11:23,416 --> 01:11:25,166
Hey! Hello!

733
01:11:30,250 --> 01:11:32,375
Hey, listen.

734
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:40,625
I once caught a cod with
my bare hands. I just grabbed it...

735
01:11:42,333 --> 01:11:44,833
- It was like...
- There it is.

736
01:11:47,750 --> 01:11:49,750
- What the fuck are you doing?
- It's right there.

737
01:11:49,791 --> 01:11:54,250
I'll catch a crab ...
And I'll use the crab to catch the cod.

738
01:11:54,291 --> 01:11:58,541
We have to stick to the rules.

739
01:11:58,583 --> 01:12:01,416
Always put on a life jacket.

740
01:12:01,458 --> 01:12:04,125
Why can't you swim?
You're a gym teacher.

741
01:12:04,166 --> 01:12:05,541
I teach gym, not...

742
01:12:05,583 --> 01:12:09,708
- Forget the cod. Let's go out.
- Coming.

743
01:12:09,750 --> 01:12:12,375
- Come on.
- Coming!

744
01:12:12,416 --> 01:12:16,833
- Peter!
- Not again!

745
01:12:16,875 --> 01:12:19,250
Shut up!

746
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,125
See you in town!

747
01:12:44,125 --> 01:12:47,708
<i>Oh, what a jolly night!</i>

748
01:13:08,625 --> 01:13:10,875
We gotta eat. Gotta eat.

749
01:13:10,916 --> 01:13:13,750
1,000 kroner for some fish 'n' chips.

750
01:13:13,791 --> 01:13:15,791
2,000... 3,000.

751
01:13:15,833 --> 01:13:19,083
Take your money. Drop it.

752
01:13:19,125 --> 01:13:21,791
So I'll eat it.

753
01:13:21,833 --> 01:13:23,416
Don't do that.

754
01:13:25,625 --> 01:13:29,500
- Karen, give me 47 47s.
- That's a Christmas beer.

755
01:13:29,541 --> 01:13:31,333
47 47s!

756
01:13:31,375 --> 01:13:33,833
- Last round!
- Tommy...

757
01:13:39,333 --> 01:13:44,291
You've had your fill of beer, dearie.
Good night and sleep tight.

758
01:13:47,833 --> 01:13:50,708
Last round!

759
01:13:51,625 --> 01:13:54,458
Get down from there!

760
01:13:54,500 --> 01:13:58,041
He just wants to show us
his jazz ballet moves.

761
01:13:58,916 --> 01:14:01,583
Dance...!

762
01:14:11,250 --> 01:14:13,500
Are you coming?

763
01:14:21,208 --> 01:14:23,208
Coming?

764
01:15:26,750 --> 01:15:31,375
Ew, Nikolaj, you just pissed!
Gross!

765
01:15:31,416 --> 01:15:32,500
Aw!

766
01:15:32,541 --> 01:15:37,375
- What's happening, Mom?
- Dad just peed in the bed.

767
01:15:37,416 --> 01:15:41,291
- Ew, that's gross.
- Christ, just how drunk are you?

768
01:15:41,333 --> 01:15:45,083
Hey, calm down.
Do we even know...

769
01:15:45,125 --> 01:15:49,750
- Otto pees on me, too.
- You're so far out.

770
01:15:49,791 --> 01:15:52,416
Let's go watch some TV.

771
01:15:53,708 --> 01:15:56,291
Is it time to get up? Now?

772
01:16:00,875 --> 01:16:04,416
- Nikolaj, what are you doing?
- Checking to see if I can drive.

773
01:16:04,458 --> 01:16:07,791
Drive? That's the baby monitor!

774
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:12,125
- Help me get up.
- Hell no.

775
01:16:14,208 --> 01:16:17,208
You're not fit to look
after your kids anymore.

776
01:16:17,250 --> 01:16:21,416
There, there, sweetie.

777
01:16:21,458 --> 01:16:25,458
Deal with this mess by yourself.
We're going to my sister's.

778
01:16:26,666 --> 01:16:28,833
Nikolaj, do you understand?!

779
01:16:58,500 --> 01:17:02,583
- Hello. It's the neighbor.
- He's bleeding.

780
01:17:02,625 --> 01:17:08,125
- Look, go back in...
- And bring Kenya. Get him up.

781
01:17:10,833 --> 01:17:13,041
I can't...

782
01:17:13,083 --> 01:17:16,125
Come on, get up.

783
01:17:16,166 --> 01:17:18,583
I'll take him from here.

784
01:17:19,750 --> 01:17:23,875
- Hi, Jonas.
- This isn't our house, Dad.

785
01:17:23,916 --> 01:17:25,625
Let's go home.

786
01:17:26,458 --> 01:17:30,458
- Just hang on...
- Hey, take it easy.

787
01:17:32,708 --> 01:17:34,333
Okay.

788
01:18:18,625 --> 01:18:22,625
You have to explain to the children
what happened, Martin.

789
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
Okay.

790
01:18:29,416 --> 01:18:32,625
Well, I got a little drunk yesterday.

791
01:18:37,333 --> 01:18:42,458
But Dad, you've been drunk
for a while, haven't you?

792
01:18:42,500 --> 01:18:43,208
Yes.

793
01:18:44,458 --> 01:18:46,625
Everybody knows now, I think.

794
01:18:52,458 --> 01:18:56,291
- Please go to your rooms.
- But we just sat down.

795
01:18:56,333 --> 01:18:58,125
Now.

796
01:19:11,833 --> 01:19:14,833
What's going on, Martin?

797
01:19:15,541 --> 01:19:18,375
I don't recognize you anymore.

798
01:19:19,291 --> 01:19:23,375
I haven't recognized you
for a long time.

799
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,541
We don't talk anymore.

800
01:19:30,666 --> 01:19:35,000
10 minutes on a vacation,
and then you're gone again.

801
01:19:36,083 --> 01:19:38,541
- Says you.
- Yes.

802
01:19:38,583 --> 01:19:41,583
You've been shutting me out for years.

803
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:43,666
Okay.

804
01:19:43,708 --> 01:19:47,750
I couldn't care less
if you drink with your friends.

805
01:19:47,791 --> 01:19:51,125
That's not the point.

806
01:19:51,166 --> 01:19:54,791
This entire country drinks
like maniacs anyway.

807
01:19:55,750 --> 01:20:00,041
Don't you see that our problem is
that you're never really present?

808
01:20:00,083 --> 01:20:02,583
You're completely invisible!

809
01:20:04,166 --> 01:20:08,041
And when you have fun,
it's with someone other than me.

810
01:20:15,958 --> 01:20:20,375
Are you also having fun
with someone other than me?

811
01:20:21,375 --> 01:20:25,625
Do you have fun
with someone other than me?

812
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:30,875
Martin, I couldn't just...

813
01:20:36,458 --> 01:20:40,125
I couldn't just sit here
and wait for you.

814
01:20:44,041 --> 01:20:46,750
Don't sit here and wait for me.

815
01:20:46,791 --> 01:20:48,291
Just get out.

816
01:20:49,125 --> 01:20:51,708
Get out of here.

817
01:20:53,541 --> 01:20:55,000
Get out.

818
01:20:55,708 --> 01:20:58,666
Get the hell out of here!

819
01:20:58,708 --> 01:21:02,750
What the hell are you saying to me?
What are you saying to me?

820
01:21:05,833 --> 01:21:08,875
Nobody has to wait for me.

821
01:21:10,958 --> 01:21:13,625
Nobody has to wait for me!

822
01:22:23,666 --> 01:22:29,916
Study of Skårderud's theory that man is
born with an alcohol level 0.05% too low

823
01:22:29,958 --> 01:22:32,583
ends here...

824
01:22:46,041 --> 01:22:50,208
Due to immense,
negative social effects -

825
01:22:50,250 --> 01:22:52,708
- and danger of ...

826
01:22:52,750 --> 01:22:56,625
Alcoholism.

827
01:23:41,375 --> 01:23:46,583
I've called for this extraordinary
meeting on very unpleasant grounds.

828
01:23:46,625 --> 01:23:50,166
I hope you've had
a nice Christmas break.

829
01:23:51,333 --> 01:23:54,666
I have received consistent reports
that one or more of the faculty -

830
01:23:54,708 --> 01:23:59,125
- for some time now have been
consuming alcohol on our premises.

831
01:23:59,166 --> 01:24:01,791
During the day.

832
01:24:04,291 --> 01:24:09,500
So far, I've dismissed it
as pure fiction, but I...

833
01:24:10,500 --> 01:24:15,208
- I'm running late...
- But...

834
01:24:33,041 --> 01:24:35,166
Tommy.

835
01:24:36,666 --> 01:24:40,125
- Tommy, what's up?
- Just a little tired...

836
01:24:45,041 --> 01:24:48,666
- Maybe we should...
- I'll sit down here.

837
01:25:02,458 --> 01:25:07,375
Too many students nowadays
are little boys -

838
01:25:07,416 --> 01:25:11,500
- struggling to...

839
01:25:14,125 --> 01:25:17,083
Go ahead... Sorry.

840
01:25:22,958 --> 01:25:24,291
Tommy!

841
01:26:19,416 --> 01:26:21,416
Laban.

842
01:26:24,125 --> 01:26:30,000
Hey, Laban,
did you see who stopped by, huh?

843
01:26:30,041 --> 01:26:31,458
Damn!

844
01:26:31,500 --> 01:26:36,416
Give me a hug, old buddy.

845
01:26:37,916 --> 01:26:42,125
- What the hell... did you clean up?
- Yes.

846
01:26:42,166 --> 01:26:46,875
- There's some pasta in the fridge.
- Do you want to join me?

847
01:26:46,916 --> 01:26:51,125
I'll... I'll just set the table.

848
01:26:52,125 --> 01:26:56,416
- I think I have a couple of cold ones.
- Tommy...

849
01:26:56,458 --> 01:26:59,875
- Better leave them.
- Yeah, better to leave them.

850
01:26:59,916 --> 01:27:04,416
That thing at school, what a mess.
I won't do it again.

851
01:27:04,458 --> 01:27:08,041
I know I've been spaced out -

852
01:27:08,083 --> 01:27:11,250
- but boy, it's been fun.

853
01:27:12,208 --> 01:27:14,333
It did you good.

854
01:27:15,958 --> 01:27:20,958
You were all fired up
and laid back at the same time.

855
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,833
- How's your back?
- The same.

856
01:27:24,875 --> 01:27:29,791
It'll get better.
Soon you'll be doing this and this.

857
01:27:30,958 --> 01:27:33,041
Tommy, take it easy.

858
01:27:33,791 --> 01:27:38,166
Yeah right.
I'll take it easy.

859
01:28:01,416 --> 01:28:03,625
But Martin...

860
01:28:05,958 --> 01:28:08,833
You don't all have to stop by
all the time.

861
01:28:08,875 --> 01:28:12,125
I'd rather you didn't.

862
01:28:12,166 --> 01:28:16,416
I've got a handle on things.
I promise to call the school.

863
01:28:16,458 --> 01:28:18,958
Okay. Fine.

864
01:28:20,708 --> 01:28:23,083
Let's keep in touch, okay?

865
01:28:37,333 --> 01:28:39,333
What?

866
01:28:42,750 --> 01:28:44,708
This isn't worth anything.

867
01:28:45,625 --> 01:28:47,625
What do you mean?

868
01:28:49,958 --> 01:28:52,666
You don't want this.

869
01:28:56,458 --> 01:28:59,833
But I'm rooting for you, Martin.

870
01:28:59,875 --> 01:29:02,208
And for Anika. You know?

871
01:29:03,875 --> 01:29:06,541
Martin and Anika.

872
01:29:08,083 --> 01:29:10,833
It's always been you two.

873
01:29:11,750 --> 01:29:14,666
And I know you love her, right?

874
01:29:16,291 --> 01:29:18,875
Chin up, old buddy.

875
01:29:18,916 --> 01:29:22,541
Promise me that?
That's how I remember you.

876
01:29:25,583 --> 01:29:27,958
You can do anything.

877
01:29:28,958 --> 01:29:31,916
Okay. Thanks.

878
01:29:33,666 --> 01:29:36,416
But keep in touch, okay?

879
01:30:10,708 --> 01:30:12,000
Hi.

880
01:30:15,125 --> 01:30:16,833
Well...

881
01:30:25,500 --> 01:30:27,833
Would you like something?

882
01:30:31,166 --> 01:30:34,541
Hi.
Would you like something to eat?

883
01:30:34,583 --> 01:30:38,000
Just a glass of white wine
for me, please.

884
01:30:38,041 --> 01:30:42,125
- The house wine, yes.
- Chilled.

885
01:30:42,166 --> 01:30:44,500
I'm not hungry.

886
01:30:48,291 --> 01:30:52,333
Kasper is okay
with two birthday parties.

887
01:30:53,125 --> 01:30:55,541
- One at your place and one at mine.
- Good.

888
01:30:55,583 --> 01:30:59,500
- So you could invite your mom.
- I could do that.

889
01:31:02,750 --> 01:31:06,958
- That is why you wanted to meet, right?
- Yes.

890
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:10,958
I also wanted to...

891
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:14,708
That's good. Fine. Good.

892
01:31:22,833 --> 01:31:25,083
I miss you.

893
01:31:25,875 --> 01:31:30,500
- I'd like to...
- One glass of the house white wine.

894
01:31:35,583 --> 01:31:38,541
- I'd like to apologize.
- Please...

895
01:31:42,250 --> 01:31:46,166
I haven't been okay for a long time.

896
01:31:48,208 --> 01:31:51,916
When I look at you now,
I can't help thinking about -

897
01:31:51,958 --> 01:31:56,958
- how many years I've wasted
on feeling like that. So I apologize.

898
01:31:58,708 --> 01:32:01,458
You said I'd pushed you away.

899
01:32:01,500 --> 01:32:04,500
- If that's true, then...
- I can't do this.

900
01:32:04,541 --> 01:32:08,791
- It's the biggest mistake of my life.
- I can't do this.

901
01:32:08,833 --> 01:32:12,250
I thought we were going to discuss
Kasper's birthday and practicalities.

902
01:32:12,291 --> 01:32:14,750
I just want to...

903
01:32:17,708 --> 01:32:23,333
Talk about Kasper's birthday
or practicalities, or else I'm leaving.

904
01:32:32,375 --> 01:32:35,750
Can I just say that -

905
01:32:35,791 --> 01:32:38,916
- I wish we were still together?

906
01:32:38,958 --> 01:32:42,458
Getting on with our lives.
We always could.

907
01:32:42,500 --> 01:32:45,625
- That's a long time ago.
- No, it isn't.

908
01:32:45,666 --> 01:32:48,208
Martin, that's a long time ago.

909
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:55,625
We're not a 100 years old.
I'm right here.

910
01:32:57,666 --> 01:33:01,041
You're right there looking so beautiful.

911
01:33:04,291 --> 01:33:07,000
It's not too late.
We have many years.

912
01:33:10,791 --> 01:33:12,750
Anika...

913
01:33:14,250 --> 01:33:16,625
And I love you.

914
01:33:18,083 --> 01:33:20,208
I'm sorry.

915
01:33:20,250 --> 01:33:22,875
You love me?

916
01:33:31,250 --> 01:33:32,708
I can't.

917
01:33:38,083 --> 01:33:40,041
I'm sorry.

918
01:33:45,666 --> 01:33:47,125
Anika...

919
01:33:48,416 --> 01:33:51,041
- I have to go now.
- Stay.

920
01:33:53,250 --> 01:33:55,791
Can't you wait a bit?

921
01:33:57,166 --> 01:33:59,625
Can I have my coat, please?

922
01:34:19,333 --> 01:34:23,083
- Good morning, Martin.
- Good morning.

923
01:34:36,166 --> 01:34:39,333
So, you have a history exam.

924
01:34:42,041 --> 01:34:43,208
Well...

925
01:34:44,250 --> 01:34:48,250
I can't give you anymore,
but then we have...

926
01:34:48,291 --> 01:34:52,041
We have covered some stuff.

927
01:34:52,833 --> 01:34:57,208
- Some stuff? Why do you say that?
- What do you mean?

928
01:34:57,250 --> 01:35:02,000
- Haven't we covered everything?
- Sure.

929
01:35:03,416 --> 01:35:06,083
It's like you changed gears.

930
01:35:07,083 --> 01:35:09,541
Yeah, I guess I did.

931
01:35:09,583 --> 01:35:11,458
We're totally ready.

932
01:35:14,291 --> 01:35:16,083
Okay.

933
01:35:16,125 --> 01:35:18,208
Thanks, Malthe.

934
01:35:19,125 --> 01:35:21,250
I'm glad to hear it.

935
01:35:22,291 --> 01:35:27,000
Well, happy studying.
And good luck with the exam.

936
01:35:28,625 --> 01:35:31,333
Sebastian, you're next.

937
01:35:39,958 --> 01:35:42,500
Pick a number, please.

938
01:35:44,291 --> 01:35:47,583
- What number did you get?
- Three.

939
01:35:49,291 --> 01:35:54,291
Sebastian. You didn't get
your topic. It's Kierkegaard.

940
01:35:54,333 --> 01:35:57,500
- I can't.
- Sure you can.

941
01:35:57,541 --> 01:36:02,041
- No.
- Stop it. You'll do great.

942
01:36:03,833 --> 01:36:07,125
- Do you remember anything?
- Not a thing.

943
01:36:07,166 --> 01:36:08,791
You're tensing up.

944
01:36:17,041 --> 01:36:20,583
- Drink this.
- I thought you quit.

945
01:36:20,625 --> 01:36:24,666
Go on, take a swig.
But don't make a habit of it.

946
01:36:25,666 --> 01:36:28,791
Have another swig.

947
01:36:29,541 --> 01:36:31,791
Give me some, too.

948
01:36:35,583 --> 01:36:38,083
Damn. It's force majeure.

949
01:36:40,500 --> 01:36:45,125
A human being,
according to Kierkegaard -

950
01:36:45,166 --> 01:36:51,333
- is a synthesis
of the spirit and the body.

951
01:36:57,083 --> 01:37:00,208
Sebastian, have a sip of water.

952
01:37:00,250 --> 01:37:03,250
Just to collect your thoughts.

953
01:37:20,583 --> 01:37:23,958
The concept of anxiety, was it?

954
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:30,125
Well, Kierkegaard's concept of anxiety
illustrates -

955
01:37:30,166 --> 01:37:36,875
- how a human being deals
with the notion of failing.

956
01:37:36,916 --> 01:37:41,583
- And even more importantly?
- With having failed.

957
01:37:41,625 --> 01:37:45,958
You must accept yourself as fallible -

958
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:49,833
- in order to love others and life.

959
01:37:49,875 --> 01:37:53,250
Sebastian, can you give us an example?

960
01:37:54,083 --> 01:37:57,541
Yes. I myself have failed.

961
01:38:02,500 --> 01:38:05,333
Down you go.

962
01:38:06,250 --> 01:38:09,000
Come here, Laban.

963
01:38:36,083 --> 01:38:41,958
<i>I love this variegated world</i>

964
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:47,000
<i>despite its need and strife</i>

965
01:38:47,958 --> 01:38:53,750
<i>to me the Earth is beautiful</i>

966
01:38:53,791 --> 01:38:58,250
<i>as back in the patriarchs' time.</i>

967
01:38:59,791 --> 01:39:05,916
<i>I have cried like others from pain</i>

968
01:39:05,958 --> 01:39:10,458
<i>because my bubble burst...</i>

969
01:39:11,166 --> 01:39:13,791
You got a B.

970
01:39:13,833 --> 01:39:17,416
<i>But the bubble isn't the world</i>

971
01:39:17,458 --> 01:39:22,541
<i>it's not the world that's curst.</i>

972
01:39:24,083 --> 01:39:26,375
Well done, Sebastian.

973
01:39:28,041 --> 01:39:32,458
Congratulations.
Now get out there and party.

974
01:39:35,333 --> 01:39:41,208
<i>If we had nothing to fight for</i>

975
01:39:41,250 --> 01:39:47,583
<i>what would then you and I be?</i>

976
01:39:47,625 --> 01:39:53,208
<i>And that's why I love this world</i>

977
01:39:53,250 --> 01:39:59,000
<i>despite its need and strife</i>

978
01:39:59,041 --> 01:40:04,875
<i>to me the Earth is beautiful</i>

979
01:40:04,916 --> 01:40:10,000
<i>as it was at creation's time.</i>

980
01:41:25,833 --> 01:41:28,208
- Hi, Martin.
- Hi, Peter.

981
01:41:30,416 --> 01:41:33,416
- Let's... I mean, as we're pallbearers.
- Right.

982
01:43:00,708 --> 01:43:05,416
<i>A lovely land is ours</i>

983
01:43:05,458 --> 01:43:09,958
<i>with beeches green about her</i>

984
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:18,000
<i>encircled by the sea,
encircled by the sea.</i>

985
01:43:18,041 --> 01:43:22,583
<i>Her hills and vales are manifold.</i>

986
01:43:22,625 --> 01:43:27,583
<i>Her name, of old, is Denmark</i>

987
01:43:27,625 --> 01:43:31,250
<i>and she is Freya's home</i>

988
01:43:31,291 --> 01:43:34,916
<i>and she is Freya's home.</i>

989
01:44:31,166 --> 01:44:32,958
To Tommy.

990
01:44:47,916 --> 01:44:50,875
What would Tommy have done now?

991
01:45:13,333 --> 01:45:15,541
Hi. I've spoken to Kasper.

992
01:45:16,666 --> 01:45:19,208
- A table for three?
- Thanks.

993
01:45:20,666 --> 01:45:25,875
- Would you like to start with a drink?
- Well...

994
01:45:25,916 --> 01:45:28,125
A drink?

995
01:45:29,250 --> 01:45:32,541
I need a Juvé y Camps.

996
01:45:47,458 --> 01:45:50,166
- How are you doing?
- Well...

997
01:45:51,208 --> 01:45:54,208
I think a lot about that guy.

998
01:46:05,708 --> 01:46:09,291
How are things at home?
Has the dust settled?

999
01:46:09,333 --> 01:46:11,166
- I think so.
- Great.

1000
01:46:11,208 --> 01:46:15,458
It's like we have
a new kind of connection.

1001
01:46:15,500 --> 01:46:20,875
Really? Did the kids move out? Or
are they sleeping through the night now?

1002
01:46:20,916 --> 01:46:24,375
Well, it helps
that I've stopped wetting the bed.

1003
01:46:24,416 --> 01:46:28,000
It's the little things
that make all the difference.

1004
01:46:28,041 --> 01:46:30,416
Good tip.

1005
01:46:30,458 --> 01:46:33,041
I think we're doing fine.

1006
01:46:33,083 --> 01:46:38,250
Even Amalie has finally admitted -

1007
01:46:38,291 --> 01:46:42,583
- that we've come a long way.

1008
01:46:42,625 --> 01:46:46,208
... I miss you too

1009
01:46:47,625 --> 01:46:52,333
- I'll have some more shrimps.
- Why do shrimps have roe, anyway?

1010
01:46:52,375 --> 01:46:56,416
- Nobody likes it.
- I could live on roe.

1011
01:46:57,166 --> 01:47:01,500
- Are you scared of getting fat?
- Not at all.

1012
01:47:01,541 --> 01:47:07,083
After three dinner dates with that
woman, you're all cocky. Did you hear?

1013
01:47:07,125 --> 01:47:10,625
- Peter's dating some broad.
- Who?

1014
01:47:10,666 --> 01:47:13,166
- Did you go to the Christmas bash?
- Yes.

1015
01:47:13,208 --> 01:47:15,916
She was interested in church modes.

1016
01:47:15,958 --> 01:47:20,291
So I took her to the woodwork room
and put her in a clamp -

1017
01:47:20,333 --> 01:47:25,083
- and then I gave her
a bit of the old D sharp...

1018
01:47:25,125 --> 01:47:27,625
You're so lame!

1019
01:47:27,666 --> 01:47:30,916
It's that little pottery sub,
you know.

1020
01:47:30,958 --> 01:47:35,583
Pottery?!
She's a skilled art teacher.

1021
01:47:36,875 --> 01:47:38,750
But she is.

1022
01:47:38,791 --> 01:47:42,583
- Why do you call her little?
- She is little.

1023
01:47:43,708 --> 01:47:46,458
A lot...

1024
01:47:46,500 --> 01:47:49,666
My mouth is so dry
I could sandblast a bike.

1025
01:47:49,708 --> 01:47:53,791
Waiter!
We'd like the wine list.

1026
01:47:58,375 --> 01:48:00,416
There come the graduates.

1027
01:48:00,458 --> 01:48:04,083
You're right!
There come our graduates!

1028
01:48:06,583 --> 01:48:09,125
Congratulations!

1029
01:48:23,500 --> 01:48:28,625
I think Tommy is rooting for you and me.

1030
01:48:40,375 --> 01:48:44,000
Me too...

1031
01:49:05,583 --> 01:49:07,000
Cheers!

1032
01:49:26,916 --> 01:49:29,125
What are you doing?!

1033
01:49:42,250 --> 01:49:44,916
Did you see them throwing me
into the air?

1034
01:49:44,958 --> 01:49:47,500
They threw me into the air.

1035
01:49:51,291 --> 01:49:54,625
Down! Down! Down!

1036
01:50:09,875 --> 01:50:11,833
Martin.

1037
01:50:12,958 --> 01:50:16,708
Now is the time.
Let's dance! Come on.

1038
01:50:17,166 --> 01:50:21,833
Now! Show me the old moves.
