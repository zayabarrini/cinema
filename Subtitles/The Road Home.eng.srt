1
00:00:46,112 --> 00:00:48,410
<i>My father died suddenly.</i>

2
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:50,745
<i>I only found out last night.</i>

3
00:00:50,817 --> 00:00:53,411
<i>The mayor called to tell me.</i>

4
00:00:53,486 --> 00:00:55,420
<i>I couldn't believe it.</i>

5
00:00:56,589 --> 00:00:59,752
<i>My hometown is in the mountains...</i>

6
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:01,794
<i>a village called Sanhetun.</i>

7
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:04,455
<i>I left to work in the city.</i>

8
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:07,989
<i>So busy I haven't been home in years.</i>

9
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:11,669
<i>My father was</i>
<i>the village schoolteacher.</i>

10
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:14,172
<i>He taught there all his life.</i>

11
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:17,209
<i>I am an only child.</i>

12
00:01:17,277 --> 00:01:19,768
<i>The only one from our village</i>
<i>who went to college.</i>

13
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:26,548
<i>I am very worried about my mother.</i>

14
00:02:01,888 --> 00:02:04,152
Come in and rest a while.

15
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:06,556
I've got to get back.

16
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:09,060
Thank your boss again for me.

17
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,154
- Thank you.
- Good-bye.

18
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,543
Mother?

19
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:31,576
- Mother?
- Yusheng.

20
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:34,745
Mayor, Uncle Xia.

21
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:39,053
I saw the car and
knew you were back.

22
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:40,717
Come in.

23
00:02:40,793 --> 00:02:42,590
It's warmer inside.

24
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:51,293
Please. Sit down.

25
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:54,898
I couldn't tell you much
over the phone.

26
00:02:54,974 --> 00:02:57,374
Now you're here
I can explain everything.

27
00:02:58,811 --> 00:03:01,075
It's the schoolhouse.

28
00:03:01,147 --> 00:03:05,049
For many years your father
has wanted to rebuild it...

29
00:03:05,118 --> 00:03:08,212
but there were always
reasons we couldn't.

30
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:11,724
He brought it up
again recently...

31
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:15,318
and the village agreed.

32
00:03:16,462 --> 00:03:19,727
We have the materials we need
but not enough money.

33
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:23,758
Your father's mind was set.
He was determined to find the money.

34
00:03:23,836 --> 00:03:27,636
He began traveling around,
trying to borrow the money.

35
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:30,073
He went all over the county.

36
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:32,873
If he thought there was a chance,
he'd go after it.

37
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:36,507
On the last trip,
on his way home...

38
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:39,347
he ran into a snowstorm,
a big blizzard.

39
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:41,717
He was stuck in the storm,
and he got sick.

40
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:44,689
He was too sick to be moved.
That made him more anxious.

41
00:03:44,757 --> 00:03:47,317
He was in bad shape
when he got back...

42
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:49,759
so we took him to the hospital.

43
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:53,560
They examined him,
said he had a heart problem.

44
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:55,692
We've known your dad
all these years.

45
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:59,431
Who knew he had
a heart condition?

46
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:01,700
They tried treating him,
but it was no use.

47
00:04:01,774 --> 00:04:05,301
He fought,
but he didn't make it.

48
00:04:05,378 --> 00:04:07,107
Where is my father now?

49
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:10,445
At the provincial hospital,
in the morgue.

50
00:04:10,516 --> 00:04:13,041
That's why we wanted
you to return.

51
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:15,144
To tell you all this.

52
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:20,589
Last time I spoke with him
he seemed fine.

53
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:24,061
It was a bad storm.

54
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:29,227
At his age,
it was too much for him.

55
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:34,035
It would have been
hard on anyone.

56
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:37,543
The village wants
to arrange a car...

57
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:40,545
to bring your father back.

58
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:45,414
Bring him back here to bury him.

59
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:48,852
That's what we planned.

60
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:53,317
That's fine. Go ahead.

61
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:55,793
But there is a problem.

62
00:04:55,862 --> 00:05:01,129
Your mother doesn't
want to use a car.

63
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,930
She wants your father
to be carried back.

64
00:05:04,003 --> 00:05:05,800
What do you mean?

65
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:11,276
She wants the coffin
brought back on foot...

66
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:14,780
so your father
won't forget his way home.

67
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:17,213
It's an old tradition,
a superstition.

68
00:05:17,283 --> 00:05:19,911
And she wants to walk with us.

69
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:24,115
- So let's do it.
- We want to.

70
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:28,024
He was our village teacher.
Everyone respects him.

71
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:31,461
But our young people
have all left for the city.

72
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:33,465
They've gone away to work.

73
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:35,763
Only old people
and children are left.

74
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:40,397
We thought of using a tractor.

75
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:42,771
We could make the trip
in half a day.

76
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:45,902
You must help
your mother decide.

77
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:49,606
I appreciate your concern.

78
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:51,877
I will talk it over with her.

79
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:53,885
- Good.
- Where is she?

80
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:59,721
Probably at the schoolhouse.

81
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:03,023
She's there every day
since he died.

82
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:06,293
- She won't listen to anyone.
- She just sits there.

83
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,300
- Is she okay?
- I think so.

84
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,336
I am only afraid...

85
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:13,133
- The old schoolhouse?
- Yes.

86
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,504
I'll go to her.

87
00:06:43,302 --> 00:06:44,826
Mother.

88
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:47,065
It's so cold.
Let's go home, okay?

89
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:50,302
Your father is dead.

90
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:55,480
Let's go home.

91
00:07:01,687 --> 00:07:05,020
You will never see him again.

92
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:28,539
Get on the bed
where it's warm.

93
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:39,190
Bring me my loom.

94
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:42,523
What for?

95
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:47,661
- I want to weave something.
- Weave what?

96
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:50,634
A cloth for your father's coffin.

97
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:54,201
Don't trouble yourself.

98
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:57,242
Why don't we go buy one instead?

99
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,574
I don't want to buy one.

100
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:05,545
That loom is so old.

101
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:08,280
It's been broken for years.

102
00:08:08,354 --> 00:08:10,481
Why can't we fix it?

103
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:17,919
You need rest, Mother.
You must be so tired.

104
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:20,591
I have to make this cloth.

105
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:24,769
Can't I just buy one?

106
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:27,965
No! Just bring me the loom.

107
00:08:58,771 --> 00:09:01,968
The only loom
left in the village...

108
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,976
is this one of your mother's.

109
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,012
She's guarded it like a treasure.

110
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:12,574
Looks like she's
determined to use it.

111
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:14,745
Just like the funeral procession.

112
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:19,780
Carrying the dead is an old custom.

113
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:22,885
Over the mountains...

114
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:26,728
across the river,
past the crossroads.

115
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:28,733
And we shout at him along the way.

116
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:31,235
What do we say?

117
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:33,670
We tell him
this is the road home.

118
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:36,936
Everyone yells at him,
so that he remembers his way home.

119
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:38,636
It's an old tradition.

120
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:41,179
Is it really so difficult...

121
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:44,739
to do as my mother wishes?

122
00:09:44,817 --> 00:09:47,308
It is a problem, yes.

123
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:50,219
We don't have the manpower.

124
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:53,315
All our young people have left.

125
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:57,626
No one has followed this custom...

126
00:09:57,697 --> 00:09:59,927
since the Cultural Revolution.

127
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,381
<i>I don't want her</i>
<i>to work like this...</i>

128
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,248
<i>but I don't know</i>
<i>how to stop her.</i>

129
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:22,287
<i>The funeral procession...</i>

130
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:25,347
<i>seems all that matters to her now.</i>

131
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:39,138
I know about your wishes
for the funeral.

132
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:42,301
I know about your wishes
for the funeral.

133
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,935
Yes.

134
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:48,469
Is there some other way
to arrange it?

135
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:52,181
I know it won't be easy.

136
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:56,116
But your father
lived here for 40 years.

137
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:03,395
He taught many
generations of kids.

138
00:11:03,462 --> 00:11:06,863
He worked very hard.
Long, long hours.

139
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:12,597
The town should give him
something back.

140
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,867
The mayor agrees with you.

141
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,874
How about this?

142
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:20,776
We can walk alongside...

143
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,973
with the coffin
pulled by a tractor.

144
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:25,381
We'd still be with him, right?

145
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:27,419
It's not the same.

146
00:11:29,555 --> 00:11:35,152
I want your father
carried back by the men.

147
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:41,363
If they won't help...

148
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:47,935
we'll get someone who will.

149
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:58,045
Please don't work anymore.

150
00:11:58,117 --> 00:12:02,144
I have to.
I have to finish it.

151
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:05,884
You are tired.
Get some rest, okay?

152
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:09,223
You sleep in
your father's study.

153
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:12,230
I have to finish this.

154
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:15,557
<i>This picture was taken the year</i>
<i>my parents married.</i>

155
00:13:17,396 --> 00:13:20,229
<i>My father was not</i>
<i>from the village.</i>

156
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,995
<i>He came here to teach.</i>

157
00:13:23,068 --> 00:13:25,730
<i>The story of</i>
<i>my parents'courtship...</i>

158
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:28,399
<i>is well known in the village.</i>

159
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:32,911
<i>Practically everyone here</i>
<i>has heard about it.</i>

160
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,808
<i>My mother had just</i>
<i>turned eighteen.</i>

161
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:39,350
<i>My father was twenty.</i>

162
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:44,583
<i>My mother told me</i>
<i>my father arrived by horse cart.</i>

163
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,098
This is our new teacher.

164
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:34,139
His name is Luo,
Luo Changyu.

165
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:25,916
Is that Di?
What's all the racket for?

166
00:15:25,991 --> 00:15:28,186
Nothing.

167
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:33,664
Has the teacher arrived?

168
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:35,063
Yes.

169
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:39,366
It's about time
we got our own teacher.

170
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:42,330
What does he look like?

171
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:44,171
He's a young man.

172
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:49,738
A young teacher?
He must be talented.

173
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:54,146
- Where is he staying?
- At the village council office.

174
00:15:54,219 --> 00:15:59,122
That's good.
Where will he eat?

175
00:15:59,191 --> 00:16:02,649
He'll eat with
a different family each day.

176
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:07,722
When it's our turn,
we'll have to make a good meal.

177
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:14,029
What are you doing?

178
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:15,937
Nothing.

179
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:20,741
Seeing a teacher
has you changing clothes?

180
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:30,622
<i>My grandmother</i>
<i>was already blind by then.</i>

181
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:32,281
<i>Mother says when</i>
<i>Grandfather died...</i>

182
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:36,124
<i>Grandmother cried</i>
<i>until she went blind.</i>

183
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:40,398
<i>After Grandfather died...</i>

184
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:43,594
<i>there was only Mother</i>
<i>to look after Grandmother.</i>

185
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:47,400
<i>Grandmother's only wish</i>
<i>was to find a good husband for Mother.</i>

186
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:49,771
<i>She had many proposals...</i>

187
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:52,072
<i>but my mother</i>
<i>didn't like any of them.</i>

188
00:16:57,249 --> 00:17:01,709
<i>The schoolhouse was not yet built</i>
<i>when my father arrived.</i>

189
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:05,279
<i>The mayor enlisted</i>
<i>all the men's help.</i>

190
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,519
<i>According to our village custom...</i>

191
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:12,086
<i>a red cloth must be hung</i>
<i>in a new building.</i>

192
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:13,893
<i>It's hung on the ceiling beam</i>
<i>for good luck.</i>

193
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:16,196
<i>The cloth is called</i>
<i>the lucky red banner.</i>

194
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:19,760
<i>It must be woven by the village's</i>
<i>most beautiful maiden.</i>

195
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:23,968
<i>This task, of course,</i>
<i>fell to my mother.</i>

196
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:28,509
<i>Perhaps she was already</i>
<i>a little in love...</i>

197
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:31,913
<i>because the cloth she made</i>
<i>was especially fine.</i>

198
00:17:40,292 --> 00:17:43,227
<i>The village had</i>
<i>two wells back then.</i>

199
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:45,388
<i>The old well was</i>
<i>called the "front well."</i>

200
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:47,398
<i>The newer well was</i>
<i>called the "back well."</i>

201
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:52,904
<i>The new well was nearer the village,</i>
<i>so more people used that one.</i>

202
00:17:52,971 --> 00:17:55,269
<i>After my father arrived...</i>

203
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,968
<i>Mother started</i>
<i>to use the old well.</i>

204
00:17:58,043 --> 00:18:00,534
<i>She had to pass</i>
<i>the schoolhouse to get to it.</i>

205
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:58,235
<i>The village had another custom.</i>

206
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:00,237
<i>When putting up a new building...</i>

207
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:04,469
<i>each family prepared a dish</i>
<i>for the workers'lunch.</i>

208
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:06,568
<i>Everyone contributed.</i>

209
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:09,842
<i>Mother prepared</i>
<i>all her best dishes...</i>

210
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:13,476
<i>hoping Father</i>
<i>would eat what she made.</i>

211
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:38,205
<i>Back then when</i>
<i>something was built...</i>

212
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:42,145
<i>women were not</i>
<i>allowed to participate.</i>

213
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:45,206
<i>Superstition said</i>
<i>they would bring bad luck.</i>

214
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:49,186
<i>When they put up the school,</i>
<i>the village women could only watch...</i>

215
00:19:49,254 --> 00:19:51,222
<i>from a distance.</i>

216
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:20,981
- What did you make today?
- Steamed bread.

217
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,817
- What about you, Di?
- I made onion cakes.

218
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:27,017
I brought rice
steamed in lotus leaves.

219
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:29,151
Onion cakes are better.

220
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,389
Did you save some
for your boyfriend?

221
00:20:31,463 --> 00:20:33,397
Shut up!

222
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,358
Look at them.

223
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:39,598
They just pick up the first dish
they see. They don't know who made what.

224
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:41,332
I don't know who's eating mine.

225
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:43,601
Must be your husband!

226
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:50,915
Put them here.

227
00:21:47,673 --> 00:21:50,574
You're already done
with the banner?

228
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:54,169
I was going to come get it from you.
Give it to me.

229
00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:55,270
Okay.

230
00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:57,975
You'll save me a further trip.

231
00:21:58,884 --> 00:22:02,047
This is a beautiful banner.

232
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,748
The school is almost finished.

233
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:07,451
Chinese study will be
the first lesson.

234
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:13,658
- Is the teacher happy with the food?
- Yes.

235
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:16,428
- Does he eat what we make?
- Yes.

236
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:19,095
- He eats together with you?
- No.

237
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:21,139
He's a city gentleman.

238
00:22:21,206 --> 00:22:23,140
It's not proper for him
to eat with us.

239
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:25,005
So, how does it work?

240
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:29,377
We give him first pick
of the dishes.

241
00:24:00,705 --> 00:24:03,071
"In life..." Follow me.

242
00:24:03,141 --> 00:24:05,166
"In life..."

243
00:24:05,243 --> 00:24:07,734
"You must make goals."

244
00:24:09,181 --> 00:24:11,115
Start from the beginning.

245
00:24:13,051 --> 00:24:16,680
"One must learn to write."

246
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:20,919
"One must learn to write."

247
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:24,450
"One must learn arithmetic."

248
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:28,727
"One must learn arithmetic."

249
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:32,793
"Keep a journal faithfully."

250
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:37,137
"Keep a journal faithfully."

251
00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:41,168
"Know the present, know the past."

252
00:24:41,246 --> 00:24:44,943
"Know the present, know the past."

253
00:24:45,016 --> 00:24:46,950
<i>When I was young,</i>
<i>my mother told me...</i>

254
00:24:47,018 --> 00:24:50,249
<i>my father had a beautiful voice.</i>

255
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:54,156
<i>My mother never learned to write,</i>
<i>was never interested in school.</i>

256
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:57,787
<i>But she couldn't resist the sound</i>
<i>of my father's voice.</i>

257
00:24:57,863 --> 00:25:02,766
<i>She went by the school</i>
<i>every day after that.</i>

258
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:06,497
<i>For most, the novelty of the new school</i>
<i>wore off after a while...</i>

259
00:25:06,571 --> 00:25:08,630
<i>but not for my mother.</i>

260
00:25:08,707 --> 00:25:11,369
<i>For 40 years,</i>
<i>she came to listen...</i>

261
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:14,378
<i>and it became part of her life.</i>

262
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:20,114
"Know respect for your elders."

263
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:24,019
"Know respect for your elders."

264
00:25:39,571 --> 00:25:42,165
<i>Each day after school...</i>

265
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,936
<i>my father walked</i>
<i>some of his students home.</i>

266
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:49,572
<i>Knowing this,</i>
<i>my mother waited along the way.</i>

267
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:19,442
<i>The birds sing</i>
<i>with the beautiful sun</i>

268
00:26:23,515 --> 00:26:28,509
<i>Their songs wake</i>
<i>the beautiful flowers</i>

269
00:31:07,498 --> 00:31:09,329
Hey!

270
00:31:34,926 --> 00:31:37,394
- Who is she?
- That's Zhao Di.

271
00:31:38,463 --> 00:31:40,624
Is she from Sanhetun?

272
00:31:40,698 --> 00:31:42,427
Yes.

273
00:31:43,501 --> 00:31:46,766
Di, the teacher
is asking about you!

274
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:35,771
- You need water?
- Yes.

275
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:38,941
- Let me get it for you.
- No, that's okay.

276
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:41,815
- Let me do it.
- I can do it. Thanks.

277
00:33:41,886 --> 00:33:44,821
No, let me. Let me help you!

278
00:33:44,889 --> 00:33:47,915
You're the teacher.
You shouldn't bother.

279
00:33:47,992 --> 00:33:50,984
- Let me do it.
- No, no.

280
00:33:51,062 --> 00:33:52,495
Come on.

281
00:34:05,643 --> 00:34:08,942
Di, you're fetching
water as well?

282
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,187
Tomorrow it's our turn
to have you over.

283
00:34:24,262 --> 00:34:25,695
I know.

284
00:35:44,909 --> 00:35:46,843
<i>My father told me...</i>

285
00:35:46,911 --> 00:35:49,641
<i>the first time</i>
<i>he went to my mother's house...</i>

286
00:35:49,714 --> 00:35:51,739
<i>she stood in the doorway.</i>

287
00:35:52,683 --> 00:35:55,880
<i>Leaning against the door frame...</i>

288
00:35:55,953 --> 00:35:58,251
<i>she looked like</i>
<i>a figure in a painting...</i>

289
00:35:58,322 --> 00:36:01,314
<i>an image he would never forget.</i>

290
00:36:07,765 --> 00:36:11,826
- Is the teacher here?
- Yes.

291
00:36:11,903 --> 00:36:14,531
Your heavy footsteps
gave you away.

292
00:36:14,605 --> 00:36:16,835
Come in. Come here.

293
00:36:17,775 --> 00:36:20,175
My mother's eyesight
is not good.

294
00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:24,275
This teacher is very tall.

295
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:26,282
Sit down.

296
00:37:11,963 --> 00:37:16,297
Can't think when we last
had a man home for dinner.

297
00:37:16,367 --> 00:37:18,665
The food must taste good to you.

298
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:21,432
You sound like you're enjoying it.

299
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:25,704
How long have you been here?

300
00:37:25,776 --> 00:37:27,573
About a month.

301
00:37:27,645 --> 00:37:29,510
Have you gotten used to it?

302
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:32,913
- It's okay.
- That's good.

303
00:37:32,984 --> 00:37:36,977
- You're from the city?
- Yes, from East Gate.

304
00:37:37,054 --> 00:37:39,022
How did you choose Sanhetun?

305
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,921
After graduation,
I couldn't find work.

306
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:43,859
One day in the street
a man was signing people up.

307
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,919
I didn't know what for,
but I signed up anyway.

308
00:37:45,997 --> 00:37:47,931
And I ended up here.

309
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:50,229
- Do you regret it?
- No.

310
00:37:50,301 --> 00:37:52,292
Why?

311
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:54,304
I like it here.

312
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:59,107
Are you married?

313
00:37:59,176 --> 00:38:00,609
No.

314
00:38:00,678 --> 00:38:02,407
Are you engaged?

315
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,243
No.

316
00:38:10,755 --> 00:38:14,191
Di will do it.
Sit for a while.

317
00:38:28,506 --> 00:38:30,531
Do you remember this bowl?

318
00:38:30,608 --> 00:38:32,542
This design?

319
00:38:34,045 --> 00:38:35,637
No, I don't remember.

320
00:38:35,713 --> 00:38:37,977
Did you eat the food
brought to the site?

321
00:38:38,049 --> 00:38:39,516
Yes.

322
00:38:39,583 --> 00:38:42,814
Looks like Di's hard work
was wasted.

323
00:38:42,887 --> 00:38:46,015
You know...

324
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:48,251
when you were
building the school...

325
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:50,294
she made all her best dishes.

326
00:38:50,361 --> 00:38:52,693
She always used that bowl...

327
00:38:52,763 --> 00:38:55,288
hoping you would choose her dish.

328
00:38:55,366 --> 00:38:58,096
Even I wasn't allowed to help.

329
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:02,331
I remember now.

330
00:39:03,407 --> 00:39:04,635
You do?

331
00:39:04,709 --> 00:39:06,939
The bowl and your cooking
are familiar.

332
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:09,479
- So you ate from it before?
- Yes.

333
00:39:09,547 --> 00:39:12,175
You did? What did you eat?

334
00:39:17,154 --> 00:39:20,214
On the first day
I made onion cakes.

335
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:23,124
On the second,
scrambled eggs and onions on rice.

336
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:25,458
On the third day,
mushroom dumplings.

337
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:28,589
What a shame.
Three delicious meals.

338
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:30,691
And I love mushroom dumplings.

339
00:39:30,768 --> 00:39:32,793
I'll make you some
this afternoon.

340
00:39:33,804 --> 00:39:35,863
- That is too much to ask.
- No.

341
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:39,273
You've hardly finished lunch,
and you're planning the next meal.

342
00:39:39,343 --> 00:39:42,710
Di, show the teacher out.
He must be very busy.

343
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:45,146
Yes, I should go.

344
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:03,760
That red jacket of yours
is pretty on you.

345
00:40:03,834 --> 00:40:05,665
I remember it
from the day I arrived.

346
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:08,534
Don't forget to come back
for dumplings.

347
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:22,678
You shouldn't make the dumplings.

348
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:25,347
- Why not?
- You may regret it.

349
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:28,957
- Why?
- You don't understand.

350
00:40:29,026 --> 00:40:31,221
This teacher is a nice man...

351
00:40:31,295 --> 00:40:33,923
but he's out of our class.

352
00:40:33,998 --> 00:40:36,660
What are you talking about?
It's only dumplings.

353
00:40:36,734 --> 00:40:38,702
Don't play dumb.

354
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:40,498
I'm just being honest.

355
00:40:40,571 --> 00:40:43,233
You'd best forget about him.

356
00:41:07,832 --> 00:41:10,392
I will not go back!

357
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:13,062
You've got no choice!

358
00:42:53,837 --> 00:42:55,998
I came to say good-bye.

359
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:59,634
- Where are you going?
- Back to the city.

360
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:03,202
- What's happened?
- Nothing.

361
00:43:04,281 --> 00:43:08,479
I saw you argue with someone.
Was that what it was about?

362
00:43:08,552 --> 00:43:10,884
Who was he?
Why do you have to go back?

363
00:43:10,955 --> 00:43:14,322
It's no big deal. They just want
to ask me some questions. That's all.

364
00:43:14,391 --> 00:43:17,690
- Can't they ask you questions here?
- He says it's not up to him.

365
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:24,200
Will you come back?

366
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:27,533
Of course!
I have classes to teach.

367
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:29,300
When will you be back?

368
00:43:29,873 --> 00:43:32,535
By the 27 th at the latest.

369
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:35,374
On the 28th the school holiday starts.
I have to be back before that.

370
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:43,749
- Come in and eat something.
- I can't.

371
00:43:43,821 --> 00:43:46,654
I have things to do before I go.

372
00:43:48,525 --> 00:43:51,187
I really do.
That man is waiting for me.

373
00:43:51,261 --> 00:43:53,252
Tell him to come too.

374
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:55,491
You have to eat in any case.

375
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:02,238
Okay, I'll be back.

376
00:44:03,741 --> 00:44:05,333
I'll wait for you.

377
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:09,639
This is for you.

378
00:44:09,713 --> 00:44:12,341
To go with your red jacket.

379
00:44:22,126 --> 00:44:24,060
I'll be waiting.

380
00:44:37,908 --> 00:44:40,376
What is going on?
No more class?

381
00:44:40,444 --> 00:44:43,106
- He's in some political trouble.
- Political trouble?

382
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:45,307
I don't understand it either.
But maybe it's nothing.

383
00:44:45,382 --> 00:44:47,350
Said he might be back
in a day or two.

384
00:45:09,506 --> 00:45:11,440
The teacher's left.

385
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:19,845
- The teacher's left?
- Yes.

386
00:45:19,917 --> 00:45:22,750
- Just left?
- Just left with the mayor.

387
00:49:57,094 --> 00:50:00,222
<i>My mother retraced her steps</i>
<i>every day...</i>

388
00:50:00,297 --> 00:50:03,061
<i>searching back and forth.</i>

389
00:50:03,133 --> 00:50:06,159
<i>She had to find the clip</i>
<i>my father had given her.</i>

390
00:51:55,979 --> 00:51:57,913
Pottery repairs!

391
00:51:57,981 --> 00:52:00,472
Please come in.

392
00:53:33,610 --> 00:53:35,578
I charge for the nails I use.

393
00:53:35,645 --> 00:53:38,239
This will cost you
more than buying a new bowl.

394
00:53:38,315 --> 00:53:42,115
Just tell me how much
and I'll pay you.

395
00:53:42,185 --> 00:53:44,153
Is it a family heirloom?

396
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:46,280
No.

397
00:53:46,356 --> 00:53:48,483
It belonged to someone special?

398
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:51,254
You could say that.

399
00:53:51,328 --> 00:53:52,818
Who?

400
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:57,594
It's for my daughter.

401
00:53:57,667 --> 00:54:01,831
The man who used it left...

402
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:05,238
and took my daughter's heart
with him.

403
00:54:06,643 --> 00:54:10,579
I've put it back together again.

404
00:54:10,647 --> 00:54:13,275
I hope she'll be happy.

405
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:25,285
Pottery repairs!

406
00:54:51,087 --> 00:54:53,453
Di, what are you doing?

407
00:54:53,523 --> 00:54:57,357
Nothing. Just getting
a drink of water.

408
00:55:45,608 --> 00:55:47,576
1 times 8 equals 8.

409
00:55:47,644 --> 00:55:49,737
1 times 9 equals 9.

410
00:55:52,282 --> 00:55:54,512
2 times 2 equals 4.

411
00:55:54,584 --> 00:55:56,882
2 times 3 equals 6.

412
00:55:56,953 --> 00:55:59,148
2 times 4 equals 8.

413
00:55:59,222 --> 00:56:01,190
2 times 5 equals 10.

414
00:56:01,257 --> 00:56:04,420
2 times 6 equals 12.

415
00:56:04,494 --> 00:56:07,395
2 times 7 equals 14.

416
00:56:07,464 --> 00:56:09,989
2 times 8 equals 16.

417
00:56:10,066 --> 00:56:12,694
2 times 9 equals 18.

418
00:56:12,769 --> 00:56:14,964
Good.

419
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:17,939
3 times 3 equals 9.

420
00:56:19,008 --> 00:56:21,442
3 times 4 equals 12.

421
00:56:21,511 --> 00:56:24,207
3 times 5 equals 15.

422
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:26,874
3 times 6 equals 18.

423
00:56:26,950 --> 00:56:29,578
3 times 7 equals 21.

424
00:56:29,652 --> 00:56:32,746
3 times 8 equals 24.

425
00:56:32,822 --> 00:56:35,017
3 times 9 equals 27.

426
00:57:31,347 --> 00:57:33,315
<i>My father told my mother...</i>

427
00:57:33,383 --> 00:57:35,317
<i>when he was teaching the kids...</i>

428
00:57:35,385 --> 00:57:37,910
<i>he could always look up</i>
<i>and see the red banner.</i>

429
00:57:37,987 --> 00:57:39,921
<i>When he saw that banner...</i>

430
00:57:39,989 --> 00:57:42,423
<i>it reminded him of Mother</i>
<i>and her red jacket.</i>

431
00:57:43,259 --> 00:57:45,250
<i>The mayor kept insisting...</i>

432
00:57:45,328 --> 00:57:47,319
<i>that the ceiling</i>
<i>needed proper insulation...</i>

433
00:57:47,397 --> 00:57:49,627
<i>but my father never let him.</i>

434
00:57:49,699 --> 00:57:54,329
<i>That's why the school ceiling</i>
<i>was never completed.</i>

435
00:59:52,088 --> 00:59:55,251
<i>Mother sat in the classroom</i>
<i>for hours that day.</i>

436
00:59:55,325 --> 00:59:58,988
<i>The door was open,</i>
<i>and the mayor saw her there.</i>

437
00:59:59,062 --> 01:00:02,225
<i>He understood what that meant.</i>

438
01:00:02,298 --> 01:00:04,232
<i>Once he knew...</i>

439
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:06,894
<i>the news got round</i>
<i>the village quickly.</i>

440
01:00:06,970 --> 01:00:08,995
<i>Back then, arranged matches</i>
<i>were the rule.</i>

441
01:00:09,072 --> 01:00:12,041
<i>The freedom of falling in love</i>
<i>was unfamiliar.</i>

442
01:00:12,108 --> 01:00:14,702
<i>This was a first for our village.</i>

443
01:00:25,421 --> 01:00:28,618
<i>On the day my father</i>
<i>promised to return...</i>

444
01:00:28,691 --> 01:00:31,888
<i>my mother was waiting</i>
<i>from first light.</i>

445
01:00:31,961 --> 01:00:34,828
<i>She remembered his promise...</i>

446
01:00:34,897 --> 01:00:37,127
<i>that he would return on the 27th.</i>

447
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:40,192
<i>School vacation</i>
<i>began on the 28th.</i>

448
01:00:40,269 --> 01:00:43,102
<i>He had to be back before that.</i>

449
01:03:03,579 --> 01:03:08,778
It's so cold out. Where have you been?
Gone all day. Get warm on the bed.

450
01:03:18,961 --> 01:03:22,453
You're burning up!

451
01:03:55,298 --> 01:03:57,994
I know you went
to wait for the teacher.

452
01:03:58,067 --> 01:04:01,059
Everyone says he's in trouble
and won't be back.

453
01:04:01,137 --> 01:04:03,196
You've got to let go.

454
01:04:06,209 --> 01:04:08,370
I'm going to the city
to find him.

455
01:04:08,444 --> 01:04:11,902
Are you crazy? You're ill!

456
01:04:12,982 --> 01:04:15,849
Di! Come back!

457
01:04:56,859 --> 01:04:58,918
<i>My mother didn't make it</i>
<i>to the city.</i>

458
01:04:58,995 --> 01:05:01,259
<i>She fainted by the road.</i>

459
01:05:01,330 --> 01:05:05,357
<i>Someone saw her,</i>
<i>and they got word to the mayor.</i>

460
01:05:05,434 --> 01:05:09,302
<i>The mayor and my uncle</i>
<i>brought her home on a cart.</i>

461
01:05:10,473 --> 01:05:15,843
<i>The mayor said that day</i>
<i>my mother's hands were like ice.</i>

462
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:19,575
<i>While on the cart,</i>
<i>they wrapped her in a heavy blanket...</i>

463
01:05:19,649 --> 01:05:22,049
<i>but they couldn't</i>
<i>get her hands warm.</i>

464
01:05:27,823 --> 01:05:29,757
I don't think it's too serious.

465
01:05:29,825 --> 01:05:33,955
It's a bad chill,
but she is strong.

466
01:05:37,233 --> 01:05:41,693
Mayor, is the teacher coming back?

467
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:47,205
I don't know the answer.

468
01:05:47,276 --> 01:05:50,143
He should have been back by now.

469
01:05:52,281 --> 01:05:55,216
Maybe someone can write to him.

470
01:05:55,284 --> 01:05:57,809
I don't know how to help her...

471
01:05:58,888 --> 01:06:02,483
if he doesn't come back.

472
01:06:15,871 --> 01:06:18,362
"Spring is here."

473
01:06:18,441 --> 01:06:20,807
"It melts the snow."

474
01:06:23,746 --> 01:06:27,512
"The grass turns green."

475
01:06:27,583 --> 01:06:32,611
"The farmers sow."

476
01:06:32,688 --> 01:06:36,488
"The ox plow the field."

477
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:40,620
"The wild geese return."

478
01:06:40,696 --> 01:06:44,427
"The frogs begin to hop."

479
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:46,491
Di, you're awake.

480
01:06:46,569 --> 01:06:48,503
You've been sleeping
for two days.

481
01:06:48,571 --> 01:06:52,371
Di, the teacher is back.

482
01:06:53,809 --> 01:06:55,777
He came back yesterday.

483
01:06:55,845 --> 01:06:57,904
He came straight here.

484
01:06:57,980 --> 01:07:00,210
He sat with you for a long time.

485
01:07:00,282 --> 01:07:04,548
Isn't it good news?

486
01:07:04,620 --> 01:07:06,986
He came back for you.

487
01:07:08,057 --> 01:07:10,787
"Full of energy."

488
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:14,125
"Our spirit comes alive."

489
01:07:14,196 --> 01:07:18,929
"Our spirit comes alive."

490
01:07:19,001 --> 01:07:23,529
"It carries our wishes."

491
01:07:23,606 --> 01:07:29,169
"Full of hope."

492
01:07:29,245 --> 01:07:32,578
"Spring is here."

493
01:07:32,648 --> 01:07:38,245
"It melts the snow."

494
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:42,552
"The grass turns green."

495
01:07:42,625 --> 01:07:46,925
"The farmers sow."

496
01:07:46,996 --> 01:07:51,160
"The ox plow the field."

497
01:07:51,233 --> 01:07:55,567
"The wild geese return."

498
01:07:55,638 --> 01:08:01,440
"The frogs begin to hop."

499
01:08:01,510 --> 01:08:04,240
"Swallows start to sing."

500
01:08:09,285 --> 01:08:14,985
"Spring is the season to sow."

501
01:08:15,057 --> 01:08:19,721
"All starts to grow again."

502
01:08:20,963 --> 01:08:23,488
"The world is full of life again."

503
01:08:23,566 --> 01:08:25,193
Mr. Luo!

504
01:08:25,267 --> 01:08:28,293
Mr. Luo, Di is here to see you!

505
01:08:29,371 --> 01:08:31,532
Sir!

506
01:08:31,607 --> 01:08:33,837
Di is here!

507
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:41,839
<i>That evening,</i>
<i>my father had to leave again.</i>

508
01:08:41,917 --> 01:08:47,048
<i>When he heard about my mother,</i>
<i>he left the city without permission.</i>

509
01:08:47,123 --> 01:08:51,389
<i>He couldn't stand it any longer,</i>
<i>so he sneaked back.</i>

510
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:53,758
<i>For this disobedience...</i>

511
01:08:53,829 --> 01:08:58,061
<i>my parents were kept apart</i>
<i>for another two years.</i>

512
01:08:59,502 --> 01:09:01,834
<i>Someone told me...</i>

513
01:09:01,904 --> 01:09:06,000
<i>that on the day my father</i>
<i>finally returned...</i>

514
01:09:06,075 --> 01:09:09,806
<i>my mother put on her red jacket,</i>
<i>my father's favorite...</i>

515
01:09:09,879 --> 01:09:12,643
<i>and stood by the road</i>
<i>to wait for him.</i>

516
01:09:12,715 --> 01:09:17,049
<i>From that day on,</i>
<i>my father never left my mother again.</i>

517
01:09:34,937 --> 01:09:37,997
<i>This is the story</i>
<i>of my father and my mother.</i>

518
01:09:38,073 --> 01:09:41,702
<i>This road is part</i>
<i>of their love story...</i>

519
01:09:42,978 --> 01:09:47,415
<i>this road that leads</i>
<i>from the city to our village.</i>

520
01:09:47,483 --> 01:09:50,452
<i>Maybe because of the hope</i>
<i>it held for her...</i>

521
01:09:50,519 --> 01:09:54,216
<i>as she waited for</i>
<i>my father to return...</i>

522
01:09:54,290 --> 01:09:58,056
<i>she wants to walk this way</i>
<i>with him one last time.</i>

523
01:09:59,428 --> 01:10:03,296
Mr. Mayor?

524
01:10:03,365 --> 01:10:05,993
- Who is it?
- It's me, Yusheng.

525
01:10:12,308 --> 01:10:14,799
- You need to see me?
- Yes.

526
01:10:14,877 --> 01:10:18,506
Come in. Come in.
It's cold out there.

527
01:10:18,581 --> 01:10:20,811
How can I help you?

528
01:10:21,884 --> 01:10:24,512
I've thought it through.

529
01:10:24,587 --> 01:10:27,385
- I want to do as my mother wishes.
- To carry him back?

530
01:10:27,456 --> 01:10:30,425
It's still a problem though.

531
01:10:30,492 --> 01:10:32,460
The problem is
not enough men, right?

532
01:10:32,528 --> 01:10:36,259
How about this?
We'll hire men from the next village.

533
01:10:37,366 --> 01:10:39,459
That's a good idea.

534
01:10:40,836 --> 01:10:42,827
But how do we pay them?

535
01:10:42,905 --> 01:10:45,999
Just tell me how many men we need.

536
01:10:47,243 --> 01:10:51,043
For a short distance, only ten...

537
01:10:51,113 --> 01:10:53,206
but this is a long trip.

538
01:10:53,282 --> 01:10:56,376
I think we need about 16.

539
01:10:56,452 --> 01:10:59,580
We will need two shifts.
That's 32 men.

540
01:10:59,655 --> 01:11:03,147
And we'll need others
to carry chairs...

541
01:11:03,225 --> 01:11:06,991
so people can rest along the way.

542
01:11:07,062 --> 01:11:10,998
That comes to about 35, 36 men.

543
01:11:11,066 --> 01:11:13,500
How much per person?

544
01:11:13,569 --> 01:11:18,370
100 Yuan each should do.
That will do.

545
01:11:19,441 --> 01:11:21,238
35, 36 people.

546
01:11:21,310 --> 01:11:24,211
How much in total?

547
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:28,410
That's 3,500 or 3,600 Yuan.

548
01:11:28,484 --> 01:11:32,750
We need to buy cigarettes.

549
01:11:32,821 --> 01:11:37,349
And wine too.
Got to ward off the cold.

550
01:11:37,426 --> 01:11:41,385
We'll also want a little extra
for emergency use.

551
01:11:41,463 --> 01:11:47,095
Altogether, around 4,000 Yuan.

552
01:11:54,143 --> 01:11:58,102
Here's 5,000 Yuan.
Is that enough?

553
01:11:58,180 --> 01:12:00,114
It's more than enough.

554
01:12:46,261 --> 01:12:49,697
Mrs. Luo, come and see Mr. Luo.

555
01:12:49,765 --> 01:12:51,699
Please don't cry.

556
01:12:51,767 --> 01:12:54,463
Don't let tears fall on him.

557
01:13:04,580 --> 01:13:08,676
Mr. Luo, we are
going back to the village.

558
01:13:10,686 --> 01:13:13,382
<i>That day over 100 people</i>
<i>came to the ceremony.</i>

559
01:13:13,455 --> 01:13:17,255
<i>The mayor told me</i>
<i>they were my father's students.</i>

560
01:13:17,326 --> 01:13:22,127
<i>They heard about his death,</i>
<i>and they all came back.</i>

561
01:13:22,197 --> 01:13:25,462
<i>Many came from other towns.</i>

562
01:13:25,534 --> 01:13:28,697
<i>Some drove from the city.</i>

563
01:13:28,771 --> 01:13:32,969
<i>The mayor said some came</i>
<i>from as far as Guangzhou.</i>

564
01:13:33,041 --> 01:13:37,705
<i>Some tried but didn't make it in time</i>
<i>because of the snowstorm.</i>

565
01:13:38,847 --> 01:13:41,407
<i>I didn't recognize many of them.</i>

566
01:13:41,483 --> 01:13:43,644
<i>Many were older than me.</i>

567
01:13:43,719 --> 01:13:46,779
<i>I don't know when</i>
<i>my father taught them.</i>

568
01:13:46,855 --> 01:13:49,847
<i>I didn't know</i>
<i>how to address them.</i>

569
01:13:49,925 --> 01:13:53,793
<i>Anyway, as the mayor said,</i>
<i>they are all my father's students.</i>

570
01:13:56,632 --> 01:13:59,294
Take this money back.

571
01:13:59,368 --> 01:14:01,734
Why? Didn't you pay the men?

572
01:14:01,804 --> 01:14:07,265
They won't take it, not even the ones
we hired. No one wants the money.

573
01:14:07,342 --> 01:14:09,503
Take it back.

574
01:16:49,071 --> 01:16:51,539
<i>At my mother's request...</i>

575
01:16:51,607 --> 01:16:54,906
<i>my father was buried</i>
<i>next to the old well.</i>

576
01:16:54,977 --> 01:16:58,435
<i>The village has running water now,</i>
<i>so no one needs a well.</i>

577
01:16:58,513 --> 01:17:00,947
<i>No one draws water from it now.</i>

578
01:17:01,016 --> 01:17:05,976
<i>My mother says from this hill</i>
<i>my father can look down on the school.</i>

579
01:17:06,054 --> 01:17:09,956
<i>She asks to be buried next to him</i>
<i>when the time comes.</i>

580
01:17:19,368 --> 01:17:19,401
<i>After my father's funeral,</i>
<i>the mayor came...</i>

581
01:17:19,401 --> 01:17:21,301
<i>After my father's funeral,</i>
<i>the mayor came...</i>

582
01:17:21,370 --> 01:17:24,965
<i>to talk about</i>
<i>rebuilding the school.</i>

583
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:27,668
<i>The city has granted funds...</i>

584
01:17:27,743 --> 01:17:30,507
<i>and the village families</i>
<i>have donated money.</i>

585
01:17:30,579 --> 01:17:34,208
<i>He says we must fulfill</i>
<i>my father's wishes.</i>

586
01:17:34,282 --> 01:17:38,150
Your money. Give it to me.

587
01:17:44,393 --> 01:17:48,989
Mayor, we've saved
over the years.

588
01:17:50,932 --> 01:17:53,264
Take it to rebuild the school.

589
01:17:53,335 --> 01:17:57,203
I can't take it.

590
01:17:57,272 --> 01:18:00,969
With my husband gone,
you have to take it.

591
01:18:01,043 --> 01:18:03,705
All right. I'll take it then.

592
01:18:03,779 --> 01:18:07,476
You are the first
but surely not the last to help.

593
01:18:08,550 --> 01:18:10,916
<i>I am leaving tomorrow.</i>

594
01:18:10,986 --> 01:18:13,819
<i>Mother has asked me to go</i>
<i>to the schoolhouse one last time.</i>

595
01:18:13,889 --> 01:18:17,848
<i>My mother says</i>
<i>the next time I come back...</i>

596
01:18:17,926 --> 01:18:21,327
<i>the school we know will be gone.</i>

597
01:18:22,464 --> 01:18:26,662
Your father helped
build this school.

598
01:18:29,237 --> 01:18:31,933
He taught here so many years.

599
01:18:32,007 --> 01:18:36,205
Spent as much time
here as at home.

600
01:18:38,213 --> 01:18:41,649
Changyu, can you hear me?

601
01:18:41,717 --> 01:18:46,120
The mayor will
rebuild the school.

602
01:18:46,188 --> 01:18:52,616
They'll build a tall...

603
01:18:52,694 --> 01:18:57,290
and wonderful school...

604
01:18:58,934 --> 01:19:03,633
just as you wished.

605
01:19:04,706 --> 01:19:08,005
They will start
building next spring.

606
01:19:09,077 --> 01:19:12,274
You won't have
to worry anymore.

607
01:19:12,347 --> 01:19:15,510
When the school is completed...

608
01:19:15,584 --> 01:19:19,850
I will hang
a lucky red banner there.

609
01:19:25,861 --> 01:19:28,762
You can rest easy now.

610
01:19:36,171 --> 01:19:40,631
You know, your father
was a sincere man.

611
01:19:40,709 --> 01:19:45,408
He always wanted you
to become a teacher...

612
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:48,278
to take over for him.

613
01:19:48,350 --> 01:19:53,344
You went to
the teachers' college...

614
01:19:53,421 --> 01:19:55,719
but you never taught
a day of class.

615
01:19:55,791 --> 01:20:00,592
If you could teach
for one day...

616
01:20:00,662 --> 01:20:05,759
I think it would
make him happy.

617
01:20:07,169 --> 01:20:12,801
Then you can go back
to your life.

618
01:20:15,310 --> 01:20:19,974
Look, there's no teacher now...

619
01:20:22,217 --> 01:20:25,880
no sound of children
reciting their lessons.

620
01:20:25,954 --> 01:20:30,823
The mayor said a new teacher
was on the way.

621
01:20:33,895 --> 01:20:36,261
Not many teachers...

622
01:20:36,331 --> 01:20:41,598
would sound as good
as your father.

623
01:20:43,305 --> 01:20:46,103
After 40 years
I still love that voice.

624
01:20:48,176 --> 01:20:50,906
I can still hear it.

625
01:20:54,449 --> 01:20:56,974
Mother, I've been thinking.

626
01:20:57,052 --> 01:20:59,885
Why don't you come
to the city with me?

627
01:21:00,956 --> 01:21:03,550
No, thank you.

628
01:21:03,625 --> 01:21:06,890
I won't leave your father.

629
01:21:06,962 --> 01:21:11,228
How can I leave you here alone?

630
01:21:12,901 --> 01:21:14,926
Don't worry about me.

631
01:21:15,003 --> 01:21:17,563
I can take care of myself.

632
01:21:18,707 --> 01:21:21,301
Are you doing
all right in the city?

633
01:21:21,376 --> 01:21:24,607
Yes. Don't worry about me.

634
01:21:24,679 --> 01:21:26,806
Do you have a girlfriend?

635
01:21:27,883 --> 01:21:30,545
Let's not talk about it.

636
01:21:30,619 --> 01:21:33,986
You're not young anymore.

637
01:21:34,055 --> 01:21:36,319
Don't be so picky.

638
01:21:37,959 --> 01:21:39,893
Listen to me.

639
01:21:39,961 --> 01:21:43,954
Find yourself a nice girl...

640
01:21:44,032 --> 01:21:47,365
and bring her home to meet me.

641
01:21:52,007 --> 01:21:56,740
Your father's gone.

642
01:21:56,811 --> 01:22:00,338
He used to worry about you.

643
01:22:03,551 --> 01:22:07,544
Our children must leave home.

644
01:22:08,957 --> 01:22:13,417
We can't keep you here forever.

645
01:22:17,899 --> 01:22:20,697
As parents...

646
01:22:21,770 --> 01:22:23,863
we let you go...

647
01:22:23,939 --> 01:22:26,407
but we never stopped worrying.

648
01:22:27,676 --> 01:22:30,304
Your father...

649
01:22:30,378 --> 01:22:35,441
missed you so.

650
01:22:40,722 --> 01:22:45,091
Please don't cry.

651
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:49,426
With your father gone,
it's hard not to feel lonely.

652
01:22:54,502 --> 01:22:56,436
I know.

653
01:23:00,008 --> 01:23:05,537
You must work hard
and make a good life.

668
01:24:42,310 --> 01:24:44,278

669
01:24:44,345 --> 01:24:48,475
<i>I said it was for my mother</i>

670
01:24:48,550 --> 01:24:51,246
<i>I stood in my father's place...</i>

671
01:24:51,319 --> 01:24:54,516

672
01:24:54,589 --> 01:24:59,617

674
01:25:05,934 --> 01:25:08,459

675
01:25:08,536 --> 01:25:11,505
