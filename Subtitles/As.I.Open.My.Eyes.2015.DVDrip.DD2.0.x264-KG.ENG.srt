1
00:00:24,257 --> 00:00:28,763
TUNIS, SUMMER 2010

2
00:01:22,682 --> 00:01:23,490
Shall we go?

3
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:24,583
What's up?

4
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:26,597
Nothing, I'm bored...

5
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,120
Shall we go?

6
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:30,724
Farah!

7
00:01:50,343 --> 00:01:53,552
AS I OPEN MY EYES

8
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:57,477
Aloulou.

9
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:01,214
Take care.

10
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:07,492
I'd better go...

11
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,163
Stay a bit longer.

12
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:28,941
Farah.

13
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:44,760
Where were you?

14
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:46,862
I was going to the police!

15
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,566
What time is this? Why didn't you call?

16
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:50,902
Where were you?

17
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:55,574
Mom, I'm sorry...

18
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,642
Look, it wasn't my fault.

19
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,380
The car broke down.

20
00:04:03,476 --> 00:04:05,217
The tire had to be changed.

21
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:06,346
Shut up.

22
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:09,218
I'm going to bed.

23
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:11,420
Tomorrow's your A-level results.

24
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:18,425
I swear I didn't mean to...

25
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:20,470
Didn't mean to? You could've called!

26
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,562
- No battery...
- You didn't reply!

27
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:24,938
Battery? You get a taxi home!

28
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:27,978
Who... What were you doing?

29
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,544
- Please, Mom...
- No! Leave me alone!

30
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:32,583
Why are you doing this to me?

31
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,317
Stop! I won't listen to you anymore!

32
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:08,615
I'm studying... architecture!

33
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:09,708
And you?

34
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:15,717
Cool! A banker and an architect!

35
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:18,887
I make the plans and you... pay up!

36
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:30,039
About me?

37
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:33,406
My hair?

38
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:35,911
Blonde... with green eyes.

39
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:42,311
Wake up!

40
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:44,343
Farah!

41
00:05:45,411 --> 00:05:46,719
What?

42
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:50,693
I called for the results.
You passed with distinction!

43
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:51,858
Really?

44
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:53,589
Yes! Well done! Get up!

45
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,959
They'll all be here soon.

46
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:07,467
- First gig tomorrow...
- Will we get beer?

47
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:10,343
Yes, four on the house.

48
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:11,938
I'll have Farah's three!

49
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:15,042
This is her first beer!
A round of applause!

50
00:06:19,078 --> 00:06:20,489
Jouima!

51
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,802
From now on it's for real.

52
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,601
Thanks for the gig.

53
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:38,573
I'll be singing!

54
00:06:57,183 --> 00:06:58,924
What do you sing?

55
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:03,899
I don't sing.

56
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:05,628
I breathe,

57
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:06,829
I'm born,

58
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:07,996
I live!

59
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:10,095
I...

60
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:17,004
During the day, I suffocate, I sob...

61
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:19,004
dead.

62
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:23,043
When night falls... at dusk,

63
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:26,954
I come here, I meet my friend

64
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:28,855
and I start to come down,

65
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:32,486
the noose loosens and my voice is freed,

66
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:33,893
from deep inside.

67
00:07:33,986 --> 00:07:36,830
You know in another life, in another time,

68
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:38,527
I was a bird!

69
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:39,997
I used to sing.

70
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:43,938
I've been watching you for a while.

71
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,439
Only watching.

72
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:48,478
Not for... No!

73
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:49,672
Just watching.

74
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:53,040
- All right, Jghal?
- Yeah...

75
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,447
She sings too.

76
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,540
Get the lute.

77
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:56,883
Get the lute!

78
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,114
Music?

79
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:02,550
He's a good bloke, that guy.

80
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:08,594
Let's get the party going!

81
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:21,705
<i>When! See this world of closed doors.</i>

82
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:27,549
<i>In inebriation, I close my</i> eyes.

83
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:33,620
<i>And every time a girl appears to me.</i>

84
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:38,489
Sometimes she seems to be the same.

85
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:41,258
<i>But then she is another</i>

86
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:48,995
<i>in my mind her image is moving.</i>

87
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:55,106
<i>An</i> eye <i>in blossom and another wilting.</i>

88
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:58,040
Blue skies.

89
00:08:58,137 --> 00:09:01,209
<i>Tum green in the light.</i>

90
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:07,080
<i>Blacks, hazels, in anger,
shining, smiling.</i>

91
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:13,721
<i>As! Open my eyes,
I see those deprived.</i>

92
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:19,932
<i>Of work, of food and a life
outside their neighborhood.</i>

93
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:25,607
<i>Despised, aggrieved,
up to their eyes in problems.</i>

94
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:29,242
<i>They breathe
through the soles of their feet.</i>

95
00:09:32,104 --> 00:09:37,918
As! Open my eyes,
<i>I</i> see those retreating to exile.

96
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:43,920
<i>Crossing the ocean's immensity
on a pilgrimage to death.</i>

97
00:09:44,617 --> 00:09:50,158
<i>With the country's troubles
people lose their minds.</i>

98
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:56,797
<i>Looking for new troubles,
different from those they know.</i>

99
00:09:56,896 --> 00:10:02,574
<i>As! Open my eyes,
I see people who are extinguished.</i>

100
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:08,851
<i>Trapped in their sweat,
their tears are salty.</i>

101
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:15,159
<i>Their blood has been stolen
and their dreams have faded.</i>

102
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:18,854
<i>On their heads.</i>

103
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:21,192
<i>Castles are being built.</i>

104
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:40,207
You are beautiful!

105
00:10:45,711 --> 00:10:45,810
Have some roast meat. It's good.

106
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:48,121
Have some roast meat. It's good.

107
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:50,319
You must miss home cooking.

108
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,862
Hayet cooks me meals each week.

109
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:54,863
You have to heat them up.

110
00:10:55,721 --> 00:10:57,667
Why are you staying in Gafsa?

111
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:02,329
Ask for a transfer to Tunis
to be near your wife and daughter.

112
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:05,803
- I forgot the harissa!
- It's okay, I'll get it.

113
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:10,307
- This is delicious.
- Bon appétit.

114
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,879
Hayet, get him some bread.

115
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,747
He has bread, Mom.

116
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:17,377
Have some yourself then.

117
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:24,318
Mahmoud, your daughter needs you.

118
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:28,394
Studying medicine is very hard.

119
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:30,759
Medicine?

120
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,770
Is this why you had us come to Gabès?

121
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:37,307
You know what she wants to do.

122
00:11:38,964 --> 00:11:40,841
Not with those marks.

123
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:43,680
You did what you wanted.

124
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:44,804
That's different!

125
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:46,042
And why is that?

126
00:11:46,138 --> 00:11:49,017
Thank God, he sent you Mahmoud.

127
00:11:55,748 --> 00:11:57,955
Still no request for a transfer?

128
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:01,131
My position hasn't changed.

129
00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:03,458
And if you join the Party?

130
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:06,064
Everyone is joining.

131
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:09,869
I'm not everyone.

132
00:12:12,164 --> 00:12:15,702
We were young and idealists.
We've grown up. That's enough.

133
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,842
Anyway, things are not good in Gafsa.

134
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:21,316
There's tension.

135
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:28,456
Do you want me back home?

136
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:31,860
Farah needs her dad.

137
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:33,957
I miss you too.

138
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:49,471
Was that your bed?

139
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:57,513
I hope I'll have your dreams.
I'll remind you of them.

140
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:02,217
Night, guy».

141
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:03,884
- What?
- Good night!

142
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:05,519
You're drunk. I'll come too.

143
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:08,197
Even if you pay me, I'm not going home.

144
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:10,124
Madam...

145
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,828
I wish you a pleasant evening.

146
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:17,841
Have a good night.

147
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:33,448
Someone's there.

148
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:35,481
- No.
- I heard a noise.

149
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:36,992
It must be a cat.

150
00:13:37,082 --> 00:13:38,493
- Come on.
- A cat!

151
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:42,555
Can I sleep at yours?

152
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:44,300
I have to go home.

153
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:47,371
My mom told the cleaning lady to watch me.

154
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:51,802
As promised, a present...

155
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:53,069
I wonder what it is...

156
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:55,069
Beer?

157
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:56,402
Here.

158
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:59,142
- Before drinking you have to...
- Cheers!

159
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:01,407
You know that!

160
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:05,945
Yuck!

161
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:07,922
It's revolting.

162
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:09,424
<i>Share one'?
No.</i>

163
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,290
To each her cigarette.

164
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:13,522
You got a lighter?

165
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:18,260
“The husband's fires,
embraced and blazing.“

166
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:20,501
Bohrène, of course.

167
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:25,332
- Bohrène's the best.
- Go on. Tell me all.

168
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:27,035
If you only knew...

169
00:14:27,132 --> 00:14:28,406
Did he touch you?

170
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:31,040
Really?

171
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:33,339
- Are you ashamed?
- Why?

172
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:35,146
Did he touch you all over?

173
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:40,853
Articulate. Have you lost your tongue?

174
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:43,583
His name's Khalouda.

175
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,453
Khalouda? Khaled.

176
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:50,459
- That's his nickname...
- A nickname, already? Wow.

177
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,968
I told him my name's Senda.

178
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:56,432
Why? Ahlem's a pretty name.

179
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:59,076
I'm not telling him my name's Ahlem.

180
00:14:59,164 --> 00:15:02,941
Senda makes you think of
a blonde with green eyes.

181
00:15:06,138 --> 00:15:07,947
Are you drunk?

182
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:25,261
Who is this?

183
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:39,645
IT'S MONCEF.
IT'S ABOUT YOUR DAUGHTER.

184
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,941
I'LL COME ROUND THIS AFTERNOON.

185
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,459
Farah. Your mom's back.

186
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:51,619
You smell of beer. Get up.

187
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:09,209
You're back early. You okay?

188
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:11,276
I forgot something.

189
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:13,576
Are you all right?

190
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:18,485
How are Grandma Hamida and Dad?

191
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:22,423
Your grandma was moaning
because you weren't there.

192
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:25,025
Your dad misses you.

193
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,687
What are you doing today?

194
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:32,597
Rehearsing all day then I'll come home
and change for the gig.

195
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:34,398
Can you pick me up?

196
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:37,205
Can't I come tonight?

197
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:41,133
We already talked about that.
You wouldn't like it.

198
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:42,233
Okay.

199
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:45,310
But I want to meet your friends later.

200
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:46,644
Okay.

201
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:48,685
Go and get ready then.

202
00:16:51,477 --> 00:16:53,013
And don't forget...

203
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:57,293
we have to hand in
your form for university tomorrow.

204
00:16:57,383 --> 00:16:59,522
It's ready. It's on my desk. Take it.

205
00:16:59,618 --> 00:17:00,618
Good.

206
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:08,628
<i>From boredom, nothing survives.</i>

207
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:11,367
<i>Sober or inebriated.</i>

208
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:17,203
<i>Your head explodes from torpidity.</i>

209
00:17:17,302 --> 00:17:20,374
Neither remedy nor incense
have any effect.

210
00:17:23,575 --> 00:17:28,285
<i>Wherever you go
you're up against the wall.</i>

211
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:33,688
<i>You find yourself
turning, turning, turning.</i>

212
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:09,689
<i>From boredom, nothing survives
sober or inebriated.</i>

213
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:14,434
<i>You're overflowing with bad luck.</i>

214
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:19,366
Every night, every day.

215
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:32,111
<i>And should you rejoice
the sky falls in on you.</i>

216
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:38,759
<i>You get up, flee
and you're turning, turning.</i>

217
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:21,535
Keep going.

218
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:25,239
Take it from the top.

219
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:27,142
Ska, focus.

220
00:19:27,232 --> 00:19:29,576
Bohrène, why take it from the top?

221
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:30,703
We need the end.

222
00:19:30,802 --> 00:19:33,715
The end's not sorted.
Why do the whole thing?

223
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:36,208
There's an issue, find a solution.

224
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:37,810
What do you want me to change?

225
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:40,288
- That's your job.
- Really.

226
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:44,418
You're the singer. Adapt.
He can't change for you.

227
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:47,793
I've already tried and I can't.

228
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:50,389
The part's wrong.
Bohrène has to change it.

229
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:53,629
But the gig's tonight.

230
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:56,228
You want to play it tonight?

231
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:59,402
No, man, we'll carry on doing covers.

232
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:02,377
Are you crazy? All this work to do covers.

233
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:06,609
Farah's rig ht.
We need a week to finish it.

234
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:07,809
We'll never do it.

235
00:20:07,906 --> 00:20:09,783
Farah, that's enough.

236
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,446
What now? What did I say wrong?

237
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:13,945
What?

238
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,285
Aren't you afraid of anything?

239
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:18,759
I'm afraid of lnès.

240
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:27,396
- We said not at rehearsals.
- No one's here.

241
00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:28,971
Make up your mind.

242
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:32,470
No one must know,
not in front of the others.

243
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:34,874
- And I want a kiss.
- And you want a kiss?

244
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:39,705
Pest.

245
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:41,613
You don't know what you want.

246
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,279
See? You're fearless.

247
00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:05,863
Come over here.

248
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:10,277
We were supposed to practice
with the kids' clubs this summer.

249
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:12,610
Exactly. We're just keeping the kids.

250
00:21:12,704 --> 00:21:15,446
The rest is too much energy, movement...

251
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:18,443
The kids don't have cigarettes.

252
00:21:18,543 --> 00:21:20,523
It's Ramadan soon. Where will we go?

253
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:25,027
I've been told the bands have to go.
I'm just following the rules.

254
00:21:26,551 --> 00:21:29,998
Shit, the same problems all the time.

255
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:46,906
Go and do the bedroom.

256
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:17,644
I prefer not to talk here.

257
00:22:35,821 --> 00:22:38,802
I'm not sure I should
have come personally.

258
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:43,105
In these cases,
someone goes to talk to the parents.

259
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:52,975
Farah is hanging out with people
known to the police.

260
00:22:53,071 --> 00:22:55,950
If she carries on like them,
she'll be in trouble.

261
00:22:57,476 --> 00:22:59,615
You mean the people in her band?

262
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:04,550
Don't you have anything better to do?

263
00:23:04,649 --> 00:23:07,459
- You don't know them.
- I know my daughter.

264
00:23:11,456 --> 00:23:15,836
So you know, she was drunk in town
yesterday. In a men's bar.

265
00:23:17,028 --> 00:23:20,009
She sang as well.
A song about our country.

266
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:25,905
Hayet, you need
to look out for your daughter...

267
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:35,983
She reminds me of you at her age.

268
00:23:45,624 --> 00:23:46,967
What I'm telling you...

269
00:23:48,126 --> 00:23:49,696
is for her own good.

270
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:52,868
You should have sent someone else.

271
00:23:53,698 --> 00:23:55,006
Now leave my house.

272
00:23:59,504 --> 00:24:01,074
See this gentleman out.

273
00:24:09,481 --> 00:24:10,960
What's the matter, Hayet?

274
00:24:13,652 --> 00:24:15,791
- Farah went out yesterday?
- I don't know.

275
00:24:15,887 --> 00:24:16,729
You're lying.

276
00:24:16,822 --> 00:24:19,428
She was asleep. I wanted to see Khalouda.

277
00:24:19,524 --> 00:24:22,528
Stop lying. Khalouda.

278
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:25,801
Leave this house. You no longer work here.

279
00:24:25,897 --> 00:24:27,171
- Go on.
- Please.

280
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:28,945
Leave. Good-bye.

281
00:24:30,735 --> 00:24:31,735
Here she is...

282
00:24:32,704 --> 00:24:33,944
Can you ask her?

283
00:24:38,844 --> 00:24:40,221
Inès, from school.

284
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:43,218
Bohrène, her brother, the songwriter.

285
00:24:43,515 --> 00:24:45,222
Ali, the manager.

286
00:24:46,184 --> 00:24:48,687
Ska, drums. Sam I, the bass player.

287
00:24:48,787 --> 00:24:49,959
Get in.

288
00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:52,501
Can we drop Ali off near our house?

289
00:24:52,591 --> 00:24:54,696
We're not going home. Get in.

290
00:25:03,201 --> 00:25:04,703
What's the matter?

291
00:25:12,043 --> 00:25:13,488
Mom, what is it?

292
00:25:13,578 --> 00:25:16,252
So you drink and sing in bars now?

293
00:25:18,116 --> 00:25:21,097
- Where were you yesterday?
- Did Ahlem say that?

294
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:23,723
Ahlem's fired and that band is over.

295
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:24,994
Over? Meaning?

296
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,601
- Over.
- But the gig's tonight.

297
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:28,568
Forget that.

298
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:31,072
- What do you mean?
- You're not going! Now stop!

299
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:36,111
Don't do this to me.
They're counting on me. I have to go.

300
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:37,201
To shame me again?

301
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:40,113
Everything's bad and forbidden
and shames you!

302
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:43,118
I'm sick of this. You' re driving me nuts.

303
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,915
Don't talk to me like that!

304
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:55,188
I'm going.
It's your problem if you don't like it.

305
00:25:55,287 --> 00:25:56,766
"My problem?
Yep."

306
00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:13,044
Mom, what are you doing?

307
00:26:13,672 --> 00:26:14,810
What are you doing?

308
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:16,681
I'm sick of your dealings.

309
00:26:17,108 --> 00:26:19,554
Let's both of us finish with all that.

310
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:21,822
Please, Mom.

311
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:23,824
- Promise you won't go.
- Okay. Stop.

312
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:24,757
Promise.

313
00:26:24,849 --> 00:26:26,795
Okay, I promise. Please, stop.

314
00:26:26,885 --> 00:26:28,193
- Swear?
- I swear.

315
00:26:28,286 --> 00:26:29,560
Stop!

316
00:28:26,137 --> 00:28:27,878
Farah, what are you doing?

317
00:31:37,929 --> 00:31:38,634
Where are you going?

318
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:41,069
- I'm going home.
- Where? Come on.

319
00:31:41,165 --> 00:31:43,202
The gig's hardly started.

320
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:45,210
I'm going home.

321
00:31:46,004 --> 00:31:47,210
I have to go home.

322
00:31:47,305 --> 00:31:49,307
- Why?
- I've got worries.

323
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:52,513
We all have worries.
Why else would we play music?

324
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:57,287
No, I can't.

325
00:31:57,382 --> 00:31:59,419
But you're not a wimp.

326
00:32:00,618 --> 00:32:02,154
I'm sorry.

327
00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:08,899
Okay. Go home.

328
00:32:09,994 --> 00:32:11,268
But forget the band.

329
00:32:14,465 --> 00:32:15,535
And forget me.

330
00:32:15,633 --> 00:32:17,544
That has nothing to do with it.

331
00:32:40,491 --> 00:32:43,597
<i>My country.</i>

332
00:32:45,163 --> 00:32:47,336
<i>Oh, my country.</i>

333
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:52,073
<i>Land of dust.</i>

334
00:32:57,108 --> 00:33:03,389
<i>Your gates are closed
and bring misfortune.</i>

335
00:33:04,449 --> 00:33:08,124
<i>Tum up.</i>

336
00:33:11,723 --> 00:33:17,002
<i>Tum up the volume.</i>

337
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:20,031
<i>My country, land of dust.</i>

338
00:33:21,232 --> 00:33:23,735
<i>Your gates are closed
and bring misfortune.</i>

339
00:33:24,602 --> 00:33:26,513
<i>The starving are eating insults.</i>

340
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:36,586
<i>Your dogs' teeth are made of gold.</i>

341
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:40,060
<i>But the gums of the poor are toothless.</i>

342
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:43,696
<i>Tum up the volume.</i>

343
00:34:14,452 --> 00:34:16,454
<i>The thirsty beg to the good lord.</i>

344
00:34:17,488 --> 00:34:20,401
<i>Tomorrow,
they'll be exiled if destiny so wishes.</i>

345
00:34:33,638 --> 00:34:35,709
Thank you, that was Joujma.

346
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:37,840
Mom, don't be mad. Nothing happened to me.

347
00:35:43,174 --> 00:35:44,209
Forgive me.

348
00:35:52,283 --> 00:35:53,785
Please, talk to me.

349
00:36:23,915 --> 00:36:25,292
Do what you want.

350
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:28,155
Don't speak to me anymore.

351
00:36:28,252 --> 00:36:29,560
Don't come near me.

352
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:32,565
If you need anything, ask your dad.

353
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:34,867
Consider me dead.

354
00:36:48,439 --> 00:36:55,857
ONE MONTH LATER

355
00:37:17,635 --> 00:37:19,979
- All right?
- What do you mean all right?

356
00:37:20,271 --> 00:37:22,547
It's Ramadan. We're fasting with no money.

357
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,779
- Your telephone's switched off.
- No.

358
00:37:26,644 --> 00:37:28,487
There's been no bonus.

359
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,690
The bonus will be paid before Eid.

360
00:37:31,782 --> 00:37:33,557
Hey, ass-licker, shut up.

361
00:37:33,651 --> 00:37:35,790
Shut up. Let me talk to him.

362
00:37:35,886 --> 00:37:37,832
You'll get your bonus before Eid.

363
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:40,463
Go home.

364
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,400
Go, go.

365
00:37:55,673 --> 00:37:57,277
Get back to work.

366
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:04,251
You sold out.

367
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:10,425
<i>If you're on your way home,
bon appétit for the last time,</i>

368
00:38:10,521 --> 00:38:12,728
<i>for this year's Ramadan.</i>

369
00:38:12,823 --> 00:38:14,496
<i>Tonight is the night of doubt.</i>

370
00:38:14,592 --> 00:38:18,631
<i>The authorities will announce
according to the moon</i>

371
00:38:18,729 --> 00:38:21,335
<i>if tomorrow is Eid...</i>

372
00:38:54,965 --> 00:38:56,000
I missed you.

373
00:39:12,583 --> 00:39:14,324
Listen, everyone.

374
00:39:15,986 --> 00:39:18,057
I've got some great news.

375
00:39:19,423 --> 00:39:21,403
Farah's gotten into medical school.

376
00:39:30,067 --> 00:39:32,377
A doctor in the family at last.

377
00:39:40,144 --> 00:39:42,090
Here's the perfect gift.

378
00:39:55,126 --> 00:39:57,697
You want me to feel guilty
because I'm in Gafsa?

379
00:39:57,795 --> 00:39:58,795
No.

380
00:39:59,163 --> 00:40:02,042
Medical school is serious.

381
00:40:02,133 --> 00:40:04,511
What's musicology?

382
00:40:48,145 --> 00:40:49,624
I missed you.

383
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:20,174
What are you doing?

384
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:21,750
Checking you out.

385
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:22,840
Stop it.

386
00:42:25,576 --> 00:42:26,576
Hey, stop.

387
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:29,591
What? I've never seen a guy naked before.

388
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:30,920
I'm shy.

389
00:42:31,649 --> 00:42:32,684
Shy?

390
00:42:36,687 --> 00:42:38,792
Why are you so far away? Come here.

391
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:46,105
Can I come and live at yours?

392
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:50,773
I'd like to see you every morning...

393
00:42:54,171 --> 00:42:56,310
I can't take any more of her.

394
00:42:56,607 --> 00:42:58,917
We'll end up killing each other.

395
00:43:16,994 --> 00:43:20,305
<i>Like the bird of the night.</i>

396
00:43:21,365 --> 00:43:24,346
<i>I endured tests for toxicology.</i>

397
00:43:26,003 --> 00:43:29,177
<i>In a trance, they said.</i>

398
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:33,949
<i>This bird bears no fruit.</i>

399
00:43:35,012 --> 00:43:38,152
<i>Out of the community.</i>

400
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:42,263
<i>Heading straight for madness.</i>

401
00:43:44,755 --> 00:43:46,757
<i>He will never.</i>

402
00:43:48,158 --> 00:43:51,071
Be clean.

403
00:44:15,185 --> 00:44:17,791
<i>Like the bird of the night</i>

404
00:44:19,023 --> 00:44:22,061
<i>8 Sit the fuse.</i>

405
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:26,365
<i>You'll blind yourself they said.</i>

406
00:44:27,731 --> 00:44:30,712
<i>Do you think so? I answered.</i>

407
00:44:32,136 --> 00:44:35,276
<i>Perhaps ifs a Messing.</i>

408
00:44:37,041 --> 00:44:38,748
To see.

409
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:43,188
<i>Without hearing.</i>

410
00:45:06,003 --> 00:45:08,916
<i>Like the bird of the night.</i>

411
00:45:10,074 --> 00:45:13,055
<i>Generation after generation.</i>

412
00:45:14,344 --> 00:45:17,757
<i>I dream of a spark.</i>

413
00:45:18,782 --> 00:45:22,161
<i>Which reddens the sky</i>

414
00:45:23,754 --> 00:45:25,961
<i>of a day.</i>

415
00:45:27,191 --> 00:45:30,195
<i>Which no one has ever seen.</i>

416
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:03,962
<i>Like the bird of the night.</i>

417
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:07,773
<i>The tears of my heart are flowing.</i>

418
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:11,879
<i>I've seen a world destroyed.</i>

419
00:46:12,503 --> 00:46:16,383
<i>And deadly situations.</i>

420
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:19,883
<i>And so many hearts.</i>

421
00:46:21,178 --> 00:46:23,920
<i>Hearts that have been extinguished.</i>

422
00:46:41,331 --> 00:46:44,210
<i>Like the bird of the night.</i>

423
00:46:45,235 --> 00:46:48,216
<i>Fleeing the inevitable.</i>

424
00:46:49,273 --> 00:46:52,311
<i>Their guns are loaded.</i>

425
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:57,053
<i>Their dogs are enraged.</i>

426
00:46:58,348 --> 00:46:59,952
<i>We wonder.</i>

427
00:47:01,919 --> 00:47:04,456
<i>What they want to unleash.</i>

428
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:43,865
Ska was great. And Farah too.

429
00:47:43,961 --> 00:47:45,872
Thanks to my effects.

430
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:49,436
I want you just like that on stage.
The same energy.

431
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:51,877
You gotta make people cry.

432
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:55,581
I was nearly crying myself.
Go for it even more.

433
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:57,352
Even more.

434
00:47:57,875 --> 00:48:00,913
But we're dropping “My Country.“

435
00:48:01,011 --> 00:48:02,149
- Really?
- Why?

436
00:48:02,246 --> 00:48:04,157
It works great on stage.

437
00:48:04,248 --> 00:48:05,591
Too much of a hassle.

438
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:07,191
What's the problem?

439
00:48:07,284 --> 00:48:10,390
It went down okay once,
but it won't a second time.

440
00:48:10,487 --> 00:48:13,024
But people loved it.

441
00:48:13,123 --> 00:48:15,125
Bohrène, you know what I mean.

442
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:18,139
Ska, check the door.

443
00:48:19,363 --> 00:48:20,967
It's all right.

444
00:48:22,666 --> 00:48:25,078
Are we censoring ourselves?

445
00:48:25,168 --> 00:48:27,512
Censoring ourselves
rather than being stupid.

446
00:48:27,604 --> 00:48:30,380
Ali knows his job.
We should listen to him.

447
00:48:30,474 --> 00:48:34,354
Nothing's happened. Why change?
It makes no sense.

448
00:48:34,444 --> 00:48:35,884
- Cool it, Farah.
- It's ass-licking.

449
00:48:35,946 --> 00:48:37,516
But why? No.

450
00:48:37,614 --> 00:48:39,025
You say nothing's happened.

451
00:48:39,116 --> 00:48:41,494
You've been away a month. It's our music.

452
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:43,292
Why are you on my back?

453
00:48:43,387 --> 00:48:45,230
Is Farah your boss or what?

454
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:48,196
No one's my boss.

455
00:48:48,292 --> 00:48:51,205
Our music is about our country's problems

456
00:48:51,295 --> 00:48:54,606
and we're trying to convey a message.
We agree on that.

457
00:48:54,698 --> 00:48:55,698
We don't agree.

458
00:48:55,966 --> 00:48:58,572
So we just stay stuck in this garage?

459
00:48:58,669 --> 00:49:00,148
For how long?

460
00:49:00,504 --> 00:49:02,609
So what's the point of our music?

461
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:05,176
“Our country's problems.“

462
00:49:05,475 --> 00:49:09,389
I know you're militants,
you're great and strong.

463
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:14,087
But you know very well how hard it is
to get gigs and advances.

464
00:49:14,651 --> 00:49:18,030
People are starting to know our music.

465
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:21,125
It's gonna make problems for venue owners.

466
00:49:21,224 --> 00:49:24,068
And for us,
it will be the end of everything.

467
00:49:25,228 --> 00:49:26,639
Hang on, just a minute.

468
00:49:27,264 --> 00:49:29,266
Who could that be? Don't move.

469
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:37,645
She slept over at a girlfriend's.

470
00:49:39,343 --> 00:49:41,516
I'll get back to you.

471
00:49:43,513 --> 00:49:45,015
At least say sorry.

472
00:49:45,115 --> 00:49:46,321
- What?
- Say sorry.

473
00:49:46,416 --> 00:49:49,022
Who do you think you are?
You're in the way.

474
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:50,325
It's our fault.

475
00:49:55,258 --> 00:49:57,465
I can't go on living with Mom.

476
00:49:57,561 --> 00:50:01,031
I've got to find a place to live.

477
00:50:01,131 --> 00:50:02,576
- You're not moving.
- I can't go on.

478
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:06,136
We're not discussing it. Do you hear?

479
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:12,008
Listen to me.

480
00:50:14,311 --> 00:50:16,587
I'll talk to her about the band.

481
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,660
You'll study medicine for a year.

482
00:50:18,749 --> 00:50:19,749
What do you mean?

483
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:22,588
You know I can't force myself.

484
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:24,529
You know that.

485
00:50:25,222 --> 00:50:29,261
Yes, but musicology
won't get you anywhere in this country.

486
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:31,600
Try for a year. After that you'll see.

487
00:50:33,797 --> 00:50:37,074
But I'll hear no more
about you moving out.

488
00:50:37,768 --> 00:50:40,078
Are you listening? I'm talking to you.

489
00:50:44,274 --> 00:50:47,187
Okay, but tell Mom
I decide what I do and when.

490
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:49,353
- Okay.
- Sure?

491
00:52:04,154 --> 00:52:05,154
Come and dance.

492
00:52:05,222 --> 00:52:07,463
Stop it. Everyone's looking at you.

493
00:52:07,557 --> 00:52:09,127
Are you jealous or what?

494
00:52:12,329 --> 00:52:14,809
Here, I wrote this. It's new, read it.

495
00:52:14,898 --> 00:52:17,378
Okay, later. Come and dance.

496
00:52:18,168 --> 00:52:19,738
Please, they're staring at you.

497
00:52:19,836 --> 00:52:22,544
Oh, Bohrène, who cares? You know me.

498
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:23,709
Exactly...

499
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:25,252
What do you mean?

500
00:52:25,742 --> 00:52:27,346
What are you insinuating?

501
00:52:27,744 --> 00:52:31,658
If you want to say something, say it.
I don't like allusions.

502
00:52:31,748 --> 00:52:34,194
You do what you like. I'll do what I like.

503
00:52:34,284 --> 00:52:37,265
- Is that a threat?
- Don't come back crying to me.

504
00:53:08,418 --> 00:53:09,488
Hey, cool it.

505
00:53:09,586 --> 00:53:12,260
- It's just for fun.
- I'm with someone.

506
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:15,602
- Aren't you a feminist?
- A feminist?

507
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:17,729
I'm a feminist and you're a jerk.

508
00:53:17,827 --> 00:53:18,828
Bitch.

509
00:53:19,663 --> 00:53:21,802
I'll smack you in the face.

510
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:26,280
- Leave me alone.
- You hitting a girl?

511
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:28,371
If she wasn't a girl I would.

512
00:53:28,471 --> 00:53:29,916
We saw. Calm down.

513
00:53:32,576 --> 00:53:33,953
He's drunk.

514
00:53:58,935 --> 00:54:00,881
Get off me!

515
00:54:16,486 --> 00:54:18,363
“Hello, swallow.

516
00:54:19,656 --> 00:54:22,967
With your wild hair
and resounding opinions,

517
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:26,964
outrageous laugh,
your radical audacity...“

518
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,852
They lie even more than Ahlem.

519
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:41,445
I miss her so much.

520
00:54:42,846 --> 00:54:43,846
What's funny?

521
00:54:57,394 --> 00:54:58,873
I didn't do it for you.

522
00:54:59,362 --> 00:55:00,362
Term's begun.

523
00:55:00,764 --> 00:55:01,764
What's new?

524
00:55:02,499 --> 00:55:04,604
Just problems with my family.

525
00:55:04,701 --> 00:55:07,648
I spent Ramadan with them. It was hell.

526
00:55:07,737 --> 00:55:09,341
My brother took my money...

527
00:55:09,439 --> 00:55:12,682
Wasn't that so he could buy cows?

528
00:55:12,776 --> 00:55:14,949
Leila Ben Ali has a hand in everything.

529
00:55:15,045 --> 00:55:18,026
She gets milk for nothing.
So now it's chickens.

530
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:19,888
That's how it goes...

531
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:22,318
How's Khalouda?

532
00:55:25,522 --> 00:55:29,766
I lied to him, I said I was in Egypt.

533
00:55:31,661 --> 00:55:33,504
I told you she's a liar.

534
00:55:33,596 --> 00:55:34,666
Me, a liar?

535
00:55:34,764 --> 00:55:36,368
No, it's me.

536
00:55:36,466 --> 00:55:40,471
Oh, God, no, you're my super boss.

537
00:55:41,805 --> 00:55:42,909
Bootlicker.

538
00:55:46,776 --> 00:55:48,619
How's Bohrène?

539
00:55:49,512 --> 00:55:50,957
We had a fight...

540
00:55:51,815 --> 00:55:52,657
Why?

541
00:55:52,749 --> 00:55:53,989
Over something stupid.

542
00:55:55,385 --> 00:55:58,332
If you're not going
to ask me to marry you,

543
00:55:58,421 --> 00:56:00,867
erase my number...

544
00:56:04,094 --> 00:56:06,938
You know my address.

545
00:56:10,767 --> 00:56:12,747
If that doesn't get some action.

546
00:56:13,136 --> 00:56:15,946
He needs a shake to get him moving.

547
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:17,109
Where is she?

548
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:18,477
She's gone out.

549
00:56:20,076 --> 00:56:21,419
Where did she go?

550
00:56:21,511 --> 00:56:22,956
She's with the band...

551
00:56:26,149 --> 00:56:28,823
- Are they playing somewhere?
- I think so.

552
00:56:30,754 --> 00:56:33,360
And she and Bohrène had a fight?

553
00:56:33,456 --> 00:56:34,901
I don't think so.

554
00:56:38,528 --> 00:56:41,771
You don't know, you don't think so,
you're not sure...

555
00:56:41,865 --> 00:56:43,037
This wasn't the deal.

556
00:56:57,947 --> 00:56:59,585
Bohrène, wait...

557
00:56:59,682 --> 00:57:00,854
Can I talk to you?

558
00:57:01,484 --> 00:57:02,485
Please.

559
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:04,762
I'm sorry.

560
00:57:04,854 --> 00:57:06,026
Leave me alone.

561
00:57:06,122 --> 00:57:09,831
Forgive me, I was drunk,
I was a drag, I miss you...

562
00:57:10,126 --> 00:57:11,696
You shouldn't drink then.

563
00:57:11,795 --> 00:57:13,706
I don't like being humiliated.

564
00:57:14,497 --> 00:57:17,000
You're rig ht. Please, forgive me.

565
00:57:21,971 --> 00:57:24,611
- It's all over.
- What do you mean?

566
00:57:24,707 --> 00:57:25,708
What?

567
00:57:26,643 --> 00:57:29,522
- We go our separate ways.
- Nothing's over.

568
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:31,819
- That's it, Farah.
- No.

569
00:57:46,763 --> 00:57:46,895
As! Open my eyes,
<i>I</i> see those retreating to exile.

570
00:57:46,896 --> 00:57:51,641
As! Open my eyes,
<i>I</i> see those retreating to exile.

571
00:57:52,669 --> 00:57:57,209
<i>Crossing the ocean's immensity
on a pilgrimage to death.</i>

572
00:57:57,907 --> 00:58:03,050
<i>With the country's troubles,
people lose their minds.</i>

573
00:58:03,813 --> 00:58:08,523
<i>Looking for new troubles
different from those they know.</i>

574
00:58:09,085 --> 00:58:14,159
<i>As! Open my eyes,
I see people who are extinguished.</i>

575
00:58:14,858 --> 00:58:19,932
<i>Trapped in their sweat,
their tears are salty.</i>

576
00:58:20,563 --> 00:58:25,103
<i>Their blood has been stolen
and their dreams have faded.</i>

577
00:58:25,969 --> 00:58:30,645
<i>On their heads, castles are being built.</i>

578
00:59:11,814 --> 00:59:13,760
Hello, swallow.

579
00:59:13,850 --> 00:59:16,262
With your wild hair
and resounding opinions,

580
00:59:16,853 --> 00:59:19,197
outrageous laugh,
your radical audacity...

581
00:59:19,722 --> 00:59:20,826
How are you?

582
00:59:20,924 --> 00:59:23,871
You, who are so gentle and indifferent,

583
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:26,304
who evades accusations.

584
00:59:26,596 --> 00:59:30,271
Yet if I pull the thread, I find your hair

585
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:33,639
linking me to ten million people.

586
00:59:33,937 --> 00:59:34,938
Their crime?

587
00:59:35,038 --> 00:59:37,018
Loving you despite themselves.

588
00:59:37,106 --> 00:59:39,746
I'm neither thief nor criminal,

589
00:59:39,842 --> 00:59:41,685
nor even a smoker of joints.

590
00:59:41,778 --> 00:59:42,950
But I am addicted.

591
00:59:43,046 --> 00:59:45,686
I have ambition, I admit,
and I'll pay dearly.

592
00:59:45,782 --> 00:59:49,161
Too bad, I'm obstinate.
The wind will not divert me.

593
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:51,858
Standing before me in your green dress,

594
00:59:51,955 --> 00:59:54,060
you run through my blood, red vein.

595
00:59:54,157 --> 00:59:56,000
Shameless, I kiss you,

596
00:59:56,092 --> 00:59:59,665
touching this hair which lures me
suffocated by a sob.

597
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:02,038
For I am a miscreant, I believe in you.

598
01:00:02,131 --> 01:00:04,611
To kiss you is to pray for your eyes.

599
01:00:04,701 --> 01:00:07,807
I believe in a love,
not from books or the skies,

600
01:00:07,904 --> 01:00:10,885
a street love, bright red
in the dark of the night.

601
01:00:10,974 --> 01:00:14,945
It takes you, fails you, flows in you,
washing away till the end

602
01:00:15,044 --> 01:00:16,318
trash cans and their cats,

603
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:17,785
cop stations and their dogs,

604
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:21,259
wrapped in paper
to be sold for nothing on the market.

605
01:00:21,351 --> 01:00:22,659
And the boss will sing:

606
01:00:22,752 --> 01:00:27,360
Oh, my Leila, the people are complaining.

607
01:00:29,158 --> 01:00:33,300
And he escapes
by jumping over the palace wall.

608
01:00:33,396 --> 01:00:36,002
And we will celebrate
from Carthage to Medina.

609
01:00:36,099 --> 01:00:38,602
I stretch out on your lap taking the oud.

610
01:00:38,701 --> 01:00:41,978
They'll be you, Leila and me her fool.

611
01:00:42,071 --> 01:00:43,982
And we plunge into dignity.

612
01:00:44,073 --> 01:00:45,347
But dignity from where?

613
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:49,112
You're the problem,
the solution, freedom and condemnation.

614
01:00:49,212 --> 01:00:50,919
The poetical necessity for a song.

615
01:00:51,347 --> 01:00:53,327
So say hello to swallow.

616
01:00:53,416 --> 01:00:55,657
Tell me how to flee from you to you.

617
01:00:55,752 --> 01:00:58,392
I love you, but I won't wait for you.

618
01:01:27,250 --> 01:01:30,356
Ali,
I'm sick of always having to be careful.

619
01:01:30,453 --> 01:01:31,898
You're young, Farah.

620
01:01:31,988 --> 01:01:33,331
I'm not young.

621
01:01:34,090 --> 01:01:35,364
You're very young.

622
01:01:39,729 --> 01:01:40,799
I don't smoke that.

623
01:01:40,897 --> 01:01:42,706
Just a drag...

624
01:01:44,434 --> 01:01:45,434
<i>I'll try it.</i>

625
01:01:45,468 --> 01:01:46,947
It'll clear your head.

626
01:01:57,980 --> 01:02:00,187
Another drag.

627
01:02:02,785 --> 01:02:04,059
Come here.

628
01:02:37,820 --> 01:02:40,096
Sorry, Ali...

629
01:02:40,189 --> 01:02:42,430
I adore you. You're like a brother.

630
01:02:43,392 --> 01:02:45,338
And there's Bohrène.

631
01:02:48,397 --> 01:02:50,399
Bohrène's not holding back.

632
01:02:51,033 --> 01:02:52,512
You know I love him.

633
01:03:56,866 --> 01:03:59,210
I'm afraid for you. I can't go on.

634
01:03:59,302 --> 01:04:00,372
I'm tired.

635
01:04:03,139 --> 01:04:04,447
Please, stop.

636
01:04:05,441 --> 01:04:07,387
Everyone's scared for nothing.

637
01:04:07,476 --> 01:04:11,856
Not for nothing.
There are cops following you...

638
01:04:11,948 --> 01:04:14,326
ls that your latest story?

639
01:04:14,417 --> 01:04:18,092
Leave it. I'll study medicine,
so leave me alone.

640
01:04:19,922 --> 01:04:21,333
- Shall we play?
- No.

641
01:04:21,424 --> 01:04:22,424
Come on.

642
01:04:24,927 --> 01:04:26,838
We haven't seen Bohrène for 2 days.

643
01:04:26,929 --> 01:04:28,499
He's always late.

644
01:04:28,598 --> 01:04:30,134
We need to talk.

645
01:04:32,635 --> 01:04:34,137
What is it?

646
01:04:34,237 --> 01:04:36,877
<i>Mew worries...</i>

647
01:04:38,007 --> 01:04:39,213
Do you like it?

648
01:04:45,147 --> 01:04:46,956
What are you doing here?

649
01:04:47,049 --> 01:04:49,586
What's going on?

650
01:04:51,020 --> 01:04:52,556
Calm down... Hang on...

651
01:04:52,655 --> 01:04:55,329
I got beaten up all night, thanks to him.

652
01:04:55,424 --> 01:04:57,563
Happy now? Did you get to sing?

653
01:04:57,660 --> 01:04:59,230
What's going on?

654
01:05:00,129 --> 01:05:03,042
I saw what you've been filming.

655
01:05:03,132 --> 01:05:06,136
They beat me up as I watched your videos.

656
01:05:06,936 --> 01:05:08,609
This bastard's a cop.

657
01:05:11,073 --> 01:05:12,347
They were stolen.

658
01:05:12,441 --> 01:05:13,511
Stolen?

659
01:05:13,609 --> 01:05:16,988
And the camera filming
on the table was stolen too?

660
01:05:17,546 --> 01:05:19,423
- Stolen?
- Stolen.

661
01:05:22,485 --> 01:05:23,657
What a liar.

662
01:05:23,953 --> 01:05:26,399
Why do you say that? I can explain...

663
01:05:26,489 --> 01:05:27,524
Bastard.

664
01:05:27,623 --> 01:05:30,331
I thought you were my mate.

665
01:05:33,129 --> 01:05:35,109
They're setting us against each other.

666
01:05:35,197 --> 01:05:38,667
You betrayed us.
You traded our friendship.

667
01:05:39,468 --> 01:05:40,970
Get out of here.

668
01:05:43,439 --> 01:05:45,476
Take your shit and get out.

669
01:05:46,442 --> 01:05:48,615
Okay, you're a hero?

670
01:05:48,711 --> 01:05:51,089
You're all rich kids.

671
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:53,592
One call, it's over. You got out, huh?

672
01:05:53,683 --> 01:05:55,060
They fucked me over.

673
01:05:55,151 --> 01:05:56,289
Yeah.

674
01:05:56,719 --> 01:05:58,926
A hero and you're moaning?

675
01:05:59,021 --> 01:06:00,056
Aren't you a hero?

676
01:06:00,156 --> 01:06:01,464
Get out of here.

677
01:06:02,291 --> 01:06:03,361
Get out.

678
01:06:05,328 --> 01:06:07,171
Okay. Keep cool.

679
01:07:40,756 --> 01:07:43,362
Farah, I want to talk to you.

680
01:07:43,459 --> 01:07:45,461
- Here.
- No, keep it.

681
01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:50,574
I don't want to lose you.

682
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:52,477
Why did you do that?

683
01:07:55,137 --> 01:07:56,639
Farah, I'm protecting you.

684
01:07:56,739 --> 01:07:58,082
Let go of me.

685
01:07:59,175 --> 01:08:01,621
- Cool.
- Let me go. Don't touch me.

686
01:08:01,710 --> 01:08:03,519
Let me pass. Let go.

687
01:08:03,612 --> 01:08:06,616
It's not normal
that nothing's happened to you up to now.

688
01:08:10,553 --> 01:08:13,329
I can't be the only one protecting you.

689
01:08:47,189 --> 01:08:48,668
What are you doing here?

690
01:08:48,757 --> 01:08:50,293
I've come to sing.

691
01:08:50,392 --> 01:08:52,429
- The gig's canceled.
- Why?

692
01:08:52,528 --> 01:08:54,565
I don't know. We're not doing it.

693
01:08:54,663 --> 01:08:56,438
Look after the gear.

694
01:08:56,832 --> 01:08:59,779
Can you bring the car?

695
01:08:59,869 --> 01:09:01,212
Is everything out?

696
01:09:01,303 --> 01:09:02,509
I'm on it.

697
01:09:05,341 --> 01:09:06,581
I need to talk to you.

698
01:09:07,343 --> 01:09:08,413
Come with me.

699
01:09:13,315 --> 01:09:17,525
Go home. We've got enough problems
and it's going to get worse.

700
01:09:17,620 --> 01:09:20,191
Go home and be careful on the way.

701
01:09:33,903 --> 01:09:35,644
- Stop there.
- I'm playing.

702
01:09:35,738 --> 01:09:37,513
- The venue's closed.
- Why?

703
01:09:37,606 --> 01:09:39,347
Health and Safety.

704
01:09:39,441 --> 01:09:41,614
So the gig's canceled?

705
01:09:41,710 --> 01:09:44,486
You think that's funny? Now go home.

706
01:10:43,906 --> 01:10:46,477
Hey. Take your saucepans and get lost.

707
01:10:46,575 --> 01:10:47,747
Off you go.

708
01:10:58,554 --> 01:10:59,999
- Tozeur?
- No.

709
01:11:00,289 --> 01:11:01,859
- Sousse, Monastir?
- No.

710
01:11:02,992 --> 01:11:04,994
- Mahdia?
- No, Gafsa.

711
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:12,310
Gabès?

712
01:11:12,401 --> 01:11:13,401
No.

713
01:11:13,702 --> 01:11:15,010
Where do we go for Gafsa?

714
01:11:15,304 --> 01:11:16,476
This way.

715
01:11:20,276 --> 01:11:21,380
Where are you going?

716
01:11:21,477 --> 01:11:22,478
Gafsa.

717
01:11:29,551 --> 01:11:31,428
- Do you have a seat left?
- Yes.

718
01:11:33,389 --> 01:11:35,027
I'm going to buy water.

719
01:11:35,324 --> 01:11:36,667
Hurry up, he's leaving.

720
01:11:37,593 --> 01:11:39,470
- How much is it?
- 19 dinars 300.

721
01:11:40,796 --> 01:11:42,571
Please, look after her?

722
01:11:42,665 --> 01:11:43,837
Don't worry.

723
01:11:43,932 --> 01:11:45,309
She's young.

724
01:11:45,401 --> 01:11:47,813
- Is someone meeting her?
- Her father.

725
01:11:47,903 --> 01:11:49,644
You just need to drop her.

726
01:12:00,349 --> 01:12:01,521
I'll call her.

727
01:12:02,451 --> 01:12:04,795
- She's got a phone?
- Yes, I'm calling her.

728
01:12:05,521 --> 01:12:06,864
Do you have any space?

729
01:12:07,356 --> 01:12:09,734
Wait, I'll reimburse her.

730
01:12:11,860 --> 01:12:12,964
Just a minute.

731
01:12:13,062 --> 01:12:16,441
It's the last seat. I have to leave.

732
01:12:16,532 --> 01:12:18,034
Her cell's switched off.

733
01:12:18,334 --> 01:12:19,574
It's the last seat.

734
01:12:19,668 --> 01:12:21,545
May God protect you.

735
01:12:22,604 --> 01:12:23,776
This way, sir.

736
01:13:06,915 --> 01:13:08,394
Did you see my daughter?

737
01:13:33,409 --> 01:13:34,911
- You haven't seen her?
- Who?

738
01:13:35,010 --> 01:13:37,490
My daughter, she's wearing...

739
01:13:37,946 --> 01:13:39,448
a denim jacket...

740
01:14:16,785 --> 01:14:19,129
“Didn't come home.“ What's her name?

741
01:14:19,888 --> 01:14:20,889
Farah Kallel.

742
01:14:21,490 --> 01:14:23,629
Farah Kallel, 18.

743
01:14:23,992 --> 01:14:29,135
I'll check the hospitals.
Come back tomorrow morning.

744
01:14:29,231 --> 01:14:32,110
- Can't you check now?
- No, sorry.

745
01:14:32,201 --> 01:14:33,874
I finish in an hour.

746
01:14:33,969 --> 01:14:35,778
So, look now.

747
01:14:35,871 --> 01:14:37,873
What do you mean, so?

748
01:14:37,973 --> 01:14:39,680
It's late. Time to go.

749
01:14:39,775 --> 01:14:40,913
Good-bye, mad am.

750
01:14:47,049 --> 01:14:48,790
Wait a bit. I'll call you.

751
01:14:48,884 --> 01:14:50,830
Wait, I'll call you.

752
01:14:50,919 --> 01:14:52,023
Go ahead.

753
01:14:53,088 --> 01:14:57,559
If you have any news, let us know.

754
01:15:00,896 --> 01:15:03,706
As you can see, there's no news.

755
01:15:05,767 --> 01:15:07,246
Let me see your superior.

756
01:15:07,536 --> 01:15:10,983
There's no need. Come back tomorrow
Let's hope for good news.

757
01:15:13,609 --> 01:15:16,590
I see your boss
or I make a scandal about the money.

758
01:15:16,678 --> 01:15:18,589
- What?
- Yes.

759
01:15:19,047 --> 01:15:22,756
Trust my experience.
All's well. She'll be home soon.

760
01:15:22,851 --> 01:15:24,228
I can't tell you more.

761
01:15:25,254 --> 01:15:26,254
Okay.

762
01:15:26,588 --> 01:15:27,999
I know someone.

763
01:15:28,657 --> 01:15:31,103
He's high up
at the Ministry of the Interior.

764
01:15:31,627 --> 01:15:32,628
<i>I'll</i> call him.

765
01:15:32,728 --> 01:15:34,674
Go ahead. Maybe he'll help you.

766
01:15:35,564 --> 01:15:38,135
You're welcome, madam. May God help you.

767
01:15:38,233 --> 01:15:39,735
Come back when you wish.

768
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:47,117
Hayet, any news?

769
01:15:47,209 --> 01:15:48,119
No. And you?

770
01:15:48,210 --> 01:15:50,850
Mahmoud called, he wants you to call him.

771
01:15:52,848 --> 01:15:53,952
No trace of her.

772
01:15:54,683 --> 01:15:55,957
Not in the hospitals.

773
01:15:56,952 --> 01:15:58,556
Nowhere.

774
01:16:01,924 --> 01:16:03,801
I have a bad feeling.

775
01:17:44,693 --> 01:17:45,763
Hello.

776
01:17:47,062 --> 01:17:48,302
Are you okay?

777
01:17:49,798 --> 01:17:52,108
I've lost Farah...

778
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:54,237
She just disappeared.

779
01:17:55,070 --> 01:17:57,710
One minute she was there,
and then she was gone.

780
01:18:00,709 --> 01:18:04,816
Don't worry. We must act to protect her.

781
01:18:04,913 --> 01:18:06,221
Protect her from who?

782
01:18:06,314 --> 01:18:08,419
The cops have obviously got her.

783
01:18:08,717 --> 01:18:09,422
Which cops?

784
01:18:09,718 --> 01:18:11,061
It can't be anyone else.

785
01:18:11,153 --> 01:18:12,029
It'll be okay.

786
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:14,361
People listen to us,

787
01:18:14,456 --> 01:18:16,697
they follow us on Facebook.

788
01:18:16,792 --> 01:18:18,897
We're going to make a fuss.

789
01:18:19,294 --> 01:18:22,036
This mustn't be hushed up.

790
01:18:22,130 --> 01:18:23,803
It'll be okay... It will.

791
01:18:25,133 --> 01:18:27,807
If you know a lawyer,
you should contact him.

792
01:18:29,004 --> 01:18:31,314
Farah's a strong person. You know her.

793
01:19:18,453 --> 01:19:19,796
My daughter.

794
01:19:21,523 --> 01:19:23,230
- Where is she?
- Hayet.

795
01:19:23,325 --> 01:19:25,498
- Where's my daughter?
- Come inside.

796
01:19:29,397 --> 01:19:30,774
I warned you.

797
01:19:30,866 --> 01:19:32,004
Don't worry.

798
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:34,944
- They'll calm her and let her go.
- Calm her?

799
01:19:35,036 --> 01:19:37,414
Be careful. Don't call on my cell again.

800
01:19:39,007 --> 01:19:40,008
Calm her...

801
01:19:47,082 --> 01:19:49,187
What's he doing here?

802
01:19:49,284 --> 01:19:51,286
I called him.

803
01:19:51,386 --> 01:19:53,093
Get out.

804
01:20:03,865 --> 01:20:05,401
What's this about?

805
01:20:08,036 --> 01:20:09,447
He's my only contact.

806
01:20:09,538 --> 01:20:11,176
That lousy crook?

807
01:20:12,541 --> 01:20:13,383
Him?

808
01:20:13,475 --> 01:20:15,011
He can help us.

809
01:20:15,110 --> 01:20:16,214
Him, help us?

810
01:20:18,513 --> 01:20:20,083
I'm talking to you.

811
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:27,031
I hate him more than you.

812
01:20:27,856 --> 01:20:29,164
You shouldn't have.

813
01:21:33,922 --> 01:21:37,199
I didn't think you'd remember this place.

814
01:21:40,262 --> 01:21:41,366
Our place.

815
01:21:42,097 --> 01:21:44,134
How could I forget it?

816
01:22:01,016 --> 01:22:03,121
You don't need to do that...

817
01:22:05,487 --> 01:22:08,127
They'll transfer her here tomorrow.

818
01:22:09,324 --> 01:22:11,395
Go and don't leave without her.

819
01:22:14,296 --> 01:22:15,296
Thank you.

820
01:22:48,596 --> 01:22:51,076
Can you start again from the beginning?

821
01:22:56,638 --> 01:22:59,619
That text you recited,
where did it come from?

822
01:23:00,675 --> 01:23:02,279
Who wrote it?

823
01:23:02,677 --> 01:23:04,156
Talk.

824
01:23:08,083 --> 01:23:09,687
Who writes your songs?

825
01:23:12,687 --> 01:23:14,667
Open your fucking mouth!

826
01:23:18,393 --> 01:23:20,703
Who's Bohrène?

827
01:23:20,996 --> 01:23:22,270
Where does he come from?

828
01:23:22,697 --> 01:23:24,199
How did you meet him?

829
01:23:32,073 --> 01:23:34,553
We're on your side.
We're worried about you.

830
01:23:35,710 --> 01:23:37,155
Sit up straight.

831
01:23:39,581 --> 01:23:42,687
Your Bohrène's saying stuff about you
he shouldn't.

832
01:23:44,285 --> 01:23:46,356
Have a listen for yourself.

833
01:23:49,057 --> 01:23:51,128
<i>I am patient.</i>

834
01:23:51,526 --> 01:23:55,338
<i>Tell</i> me <i>how else I'd find a girl
who likes to get naughty.</i>

835
01:23:55,430 --> 01:23:58,138
<i>She wants it. Why wouldn't! Teach her?</i>

836
01:23:59,267 --> 01:24:03,374
<i>If that requires words of love...</i>

837
01:24:03,471 --> 01:24:05,542
<i>Why else would! Be so patient?</i>

838
01:24:05,640 --> 01:24:07,779
<i>She loves hiding pieces...</i>

839
01:24:08,076 --> 01:24:12,320
<i>The more dangerous it is,
the more she likes it.</i>

840
01:24:15,517 --> 01:24:17,793
See how he talks about you?

841
01:24:20,722 --> 01:24:23,225
- Keep still.
- Please. Don't touch me.

842
01:24:28,730 --> 01:24:29,730
What?

843
01:24:31,166 --> 01:24:34,079
What about me?
Let me do something nice for you.

844
01:24:34,169 --> 01:24:35,307
Leave me alone.

845
01:24:35,403 --> 01:24:36,473
Please, don't.

846
01:24:36,571 --> 01:24:38,482
Can't I do something nice for you?

847
01:24:42,177 --> 01:24:43,781
Please, don't touch me.

848
01:24:44,746 --> 01:24:46,817
Can't I do what I want?

849
01:24:47,115 --> 01:24:48,287
Put your hands down.

850
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:54,493
Shut up when I'm talking to you!

851
01:24:57,625 --> 01:24:59,434
Seems you like danger.

852
01:25:03,198 --> 01:25:05,337
Guadida, show her some danger?

853
01:25:05,433 --> 01:25:06,571
Sure thing.

854
01:25:12,140 --> 01:25:13,642
You can scream as much as you like.

855
01:25:13,741 --> 01:25:15,743
Scream. Go on, scream!

856
01:25:18,179 --> 01:25:20,659
Yell as much as you like.
No one can hear you.

857
01:25:21,783 --> 01:25:23,626
And sing as much as you like...

858
01:25:24,152 --> 01:25:25,460
till tomorrow morning.

859
01:25:26,488 --> 01:25:29,628
Would you like to sing a song for us?

860
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:33,298
Listen, Farah...

861
01:25:36,698 --> 01:25:38,109
Put your hands down!

862
01:25:38,199 --> 01:25:39,803
He said put them down.

863
01:25:41,269 --> 01:25:42,612
Look at me.

864
01:25:42,704 --> 01:25:44,809
- Look at me!
- Please...

865
01:25:47,742 --> 01:25:49,312
Do you smoke, Farah?

866
01:25:50,211 --> 01:25:51,349
You' re a liar too!

867
01:25:51,446 --> 01:25:53,585
Your blood tests are positive.

868
01:25:53,681 --> 01:25:54,681
Okay?

869
01:25:55,283 --> 01:25:56,660
Wanna go down for a year?

870
01:25:56,751 --> 01:25:58,321
You'll get a year.

871
01:25:58,620 --> 01:25:59,792
In prison.

872
01:26:00,688 --> 01:26:03,601
It's good training for danger.

873
01:26:04,192 --> 01:26:05,193
Okay?

874
01:26:07,428 --> 01:26:09,135
You do like danger?

875
01:26:09,497 --> 01:26:11,602
Prison's one big danger party.

876
01:26:12,367 --> 01:26:13,367
Sit up straight.

877
01:26:16,304 --> 01:26:18,181
You want to carry on singing?

878
01:26:20,642 --> 01:26:21,780
Do you?

879
01:26:22,477 --> 01:26:23,387
What do you say?

880
01:26:23,478 --> 01:26:24,479
Open your mouth.

881
01:26:25,380 --> 01:26:27,360
Do you want to go on singing?

882
01:26:27,448 --> 01:26:28,791
Huh? I didn't hear.

883
01:26:28,883 --> 01:26:29,918
Answer.

884
01:26:32,187 --> 01:26:34,189
Open it! Still want to sing?

885
01:26:34,289 --> 01:26:35,324
No.

886
01:27:32,947 --> 01:27:34,517
Look, Farah.

887
01:27:38,419 --> 01:27:40,899
Not this one. I like this one...

888
01:27:42,290 --> 01:27:45,601
You like this one.
You often wear this one.

889
01:27:48,396 --> 01:27:50,273
What about this one?

890
01:27:51,299 --> 01:27:53,336
You need a bit of color.

891
01:27:53,801 --> 01:27:55,747
Wear this one.

892
01:28:10,585 --> 01:28:11,620
Come on. Get up.

893
01:28:12,053 --> 01:28:14,863
You can't go on like this. Up you get.

894
01:28:19,894 --> 01:28:20,998
You smell awful.

895
01:29:03,538 --> 01:29:04,676
My sweetheart,

896
01:29:05,106 --> 01:29:06,380
talk to me.

897
01:29:07,508 --> 01:29:09,078
What did they do to you?

898
01:29:11,746 --> 01:29:13,316
What did they do?

899
01:29:14,449 --> 01:29:15,985
I don't recognize you.

900
01:29:16,584 --> 01:29:17,824
What is it?

901
01:29:18,553 --> 01:29:19,964
We could press charges.

902
01:29:21,122 --> 01:29:22,692
What did they do to you?

903
01:29:22,790 --> 01:29:24,997
Nothing we can press charges for...

904
01:30:14,041 --> 01:30:15,418
I'm here.

905
01:30:24,685 --> 01:30:27,461
I thought I'd never get out of there.

906
01:30:31,492 --> 01:30:32,664
You are out.

907
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:34,034
You're home.

908
01:30:35,062 --> 01:30:36,063
Try to forget.

909
01:30:36,664 --> 01:30:38,109
How can you accept that?

910
01:30:39,667 --> 01:30:40,702
I didn't.

911
01:30:45,039 --> 01:30:46,950
What can I do?

912
01:30:48,776 --> 01:30:50,016
I got used to it.

913
01:30:54,582 --> 01:30:56,789
When I was little,

914
01:31:00,121 --> 01:31:02,123
I was like you. Passionate.

915
01:31:08,930 --> 01:31:10,102
I felt I had wings.

916
01:31:10,998 --> 01:31:12,477
Rebel.

917
01:31:16,904 --> 01:31:19,009
And the man I loved...

918
01:31:19,807 --> 01:31:21,081
What happened to him?

919
01:31:25,813 --> 01:31:28,020
I lost my youth with him.

920
01:31:29,817 --> 01:31:31,854
I loved him and he loved me.

921
01:31:31,953 --> 01:31:33,193
We were beautiful.

922
01:31:40,795 --> 01:31:43,708
Then he followed the path they'd decided.

923
01:31:47,101 --> 01:31:49,138
It led him nowhere.

924
01:31:54,275 --> 01:31:56,152
So what did you do?

925
01:32:03,751 --> 01:32:05,094
I had you.

926
01:32:08,789 --> 01:32:10,962
You, who stops at nothing.

927
01:32:49,564 --> 01:32:51,009
I want to talk to you.

928
01:32:51,566 --> 01:32:52,567
Why?

929
01:32:56,637 --> 01:32:58,617
Why? What's the matter?

930
01:32:59,874 --> 01:33:02,753
What did they do to you?
Why are you hitting me?

931
01:33:03,778 --> 01:33:04,778
I'm talking to you.

932
01:33:07,048 --> 01:33:08,048
Tell me...

933
01:33:08,215 --> 01:33:09,717
Tell me what's up.

934
01:33:09,817 --> 01:33:10,887
Look at me.

935
01:33:16,190 --> 01:33:18,636
Don't go, Farah. I love you.

936
01:33:19,860 --> 01:33:21,601
You don't love me.

937
01:33:21,696 --> 01:33:22,696
I love you.

938
01:33:26,300 --> 01:33:27,711
And the band, Farah?

939
01:33:27,802 --> 01:33:29,110
What band?

940
01:33:29,837 --> 01:33:31,646
Are you serious?

941
01:34:03,137 --> 01:34:04,946
Work called.

942
01:34:05,039 --> 01:34:06,677
I'll have to go back.

943
01:34:10,945 --> 01:34:12,720
I don't want to leave you.

944
01:34:16,651 --> 01:34:19,257
I've asked for a transfer to Tunis.

945
01:34:21,055 --> 01:34:23,126
It will take a while...

946
01:34:25,960 --> 01:34:27,405
You signed up for the Party?

947
01:35:12,807 --> 01:35:15,185
<i>When! See this world</i>

948
01:35:18,412 --> 01:35:20,358
<i>of dosed doors.</i>

949
01:35:35,296 --> 01:35:37,173
<i>I'm inebriated.</i>

950
01:35:39,100 --> 01:35:41,478
<i>I</i> close my eyes.

951
01:35:51,245 --> 01:35:56,820
<i>And every time a girl appears to me.</i>

952
01:35:59,820 --> 01:36:02,426
<i>Sometimes I think it's her.</i>

953
01:36:02,523 --> 01:36:04,127
The same one.

954
01:36:06,761 --> 01:36:10,265
In the end, is it her?

955
01:36:10,765 --> 01:36:11,971
It is another.

956
01:36:15,870 --> 01:36:16,905
Sing.

957
01:37:12,259 --> 01:37:13,259
Sing.

958
01:37:59,907 --> 01:38:01,045
Continue.

959
01:38:02,910 --> 01:38:03,910
Continue.
