1
00:04:32,728 --> 00:04:34,958
- How are you?
- Okay.

2
00:04:35,028 --> 00:04:37,188
Your leg
will be fine.

3
00:04:37,233 --> 00:04:39,888
A lot of shrapnel came out.
I saved you the pieces.

4
00:04:39,968 --> 00:04:43,088
You are the prettiest girl
I've ever seen.

5
00:04:43,168 --> 00:04:44,928
I don't think so.
Here.

6
00:04:45,008 --> 00:04:48,599
- Would you kiss me?
- No. I'll get you some tea.

7
00:04:48,679 --> 00:04:52,579
- It would mean such a lot to me.
- Would it?

8
00:04:57,439 --> 00:04:59,889
Thank you.

9
00:05:03,224 --> 00:05:06,249
- I can't sleep.
- Would you kiss me?

10
00:05:06,329 --> 00:05:09,189
- You're so pretty.
- Will you tuck me in, please?

11
00:05:09,189 --> 00:05:11,989
Very funny.
Go to sleep now.

12
00:05:12,068 --> 00:05:15,038
- Where's the doctor?
- Don't ask.

13
00:06:36,289 --> 00:06:39,747
God, I hate giving blood.
Can't stand needles.

14
00:06:46,266 --> 00:06:49,201
Is there anybody
from Picton?

15
00:06:49,269 --> 00:06:52,295
Picton?
I don't know.

16
00:06:52,372 --> 00:06:56,400
I'd like to see somebody
from home before I go.

17
00:07:04,051 --> 00:07:06,986
- Do we have anybody from Picton?
- Why Picton?

18
00:07:07,054 --> 00:07:09,852
He's from there. Edge of Lake Ontario,
right, soldier?

19
00:07:09,924 --> 00:07:13,451
<i>That's where your sweetie's from,</i>
<i>isn't it? Around there?</i>

20
00:07:13,527 --> 00:07:16,223
Ask him what company
he's with.

21
00:07:16,297 --> 00:07:20,496
- Third Canadian Fusiliers.
- Third Canadian Fusiliers.

22
00:07:23,371 --> 00:07:25,669
Does he know
Captain McGan?

23
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:30,200
He bought it yesterday.
Shot to bits.

24
00:07:30,278 --> 00:07:32,838
- What did he say?
- Doesn't know him.

25
00:07:36,284 --> 00:07:39,185
<i>Hana, get down!</i>

26
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:45,119
He's dead. He's dead.

27
00:07:47,196 --> 00:07:50,324
He's dead.

28
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:52,367
He's dead.

29
00:09:16,021 --> 00:09:19,718
<i>Name, rank, serial number?</i>

30
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:21,817
<i>No, sorry.</i>

31
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:24,556
I think I was a pilot.

32
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:28,226
I was found in the planewreck
at the beginning of the war.

33
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:30,235
Can you remember
where you were born?

34
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:32,965
Am I being interrogated?

35
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:36,839
You should be trying to trick me,
make me speak German.

36
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,242
- Which I can, by the way.
- Why?

37
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:42,042
-<i>Are you German?</i>
- No.

38
00:09:42,115 --> 00:09:45,983
<i>How do you know you're not German</i>
<i>if you don't remember anything?</i>

39
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:48,748
Might-- Might I have
a sip of water?

40
00:10:00,801 --> 00:10:02,894
- Thank you.
- It's okay.

41
00:10:04,672 --> 00:10:07,106
I remember
lots of things.

42
00:10:07,174 --> 00:10:11,668
I remember her garden,
plunging down to the sea.

43
00:10:11,746 --> 00:10:15,113
- <i>Nothing between you and France.</i>
- This was your garden?

44
00:10:15,182 --> 00:10:18,118
- Or my wife's.
- <i>You were married then?</i>

45
00:10:18,186 --> 00:10:22,555
I think so. Although I believe that
to be true of a number of Germans.

46
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,694
<i>Look.</i>

47
00:10:26,762 --> 00:10:30,493
I have this much lung.

48
00:10:30,565 --> 00:10:32,999
The rest of my organs
are packing up.

49
00:10:33,068 --> 00:10:36,435
What could it possibly matter
if I'm a Tutankhamen?

50
00:10:36,505 --> 00:10:40,464
I'm a bit of...
toast, my friend.

51
00:10:40,542 --> 00:10:44,104
Sorry I can't help you.

52
00:10:58,461 --> 00:11:00,656
Are you all right?

53
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:03,756
I know you hate to be moved.
I'm sorry.

54
00:11:07,303 --> 00:11:10,467
Hana!

55
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:13,942
-Jan?
- Hana!

56
00:11:14,011 --> 00:11:17,845
There's meant to be lace in the next
village. The boys are gonna take me.

57
00:11:17,915 --> 00:11:20,315
- You don't have any money, do ya?
- No.

58
00:11:20,384 --> 00:11:22,079
-Just in case there's a sale.
- <i>No.</i>

59
00:11:22,152 --> 00:11:23,779
Hana, I know you do.
Come on.

60
00:11:23,854 --> 00:11:25,412
- No!
- Oh, come on.

61
00:11:25,489 --> 00:11:28,014
I swear to God,
this'll be the last time. I swear.

62
00:11:28,092 --> 00:11:30,686
She's a softie.
She loves me.

63
00:11:32,996 --> 00:11:36,160
I'll pay you back! I promise!

64
00:11:36,234 --> 00:11:39,101
I'm not sewing
anything else for you.

65
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:41,365
I love you!

66
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:44,670
Whoa!
Pienza, boys!

67
00:12:02,061 --> 00:12:03,995
<i>Get some water</i>
<i>over here!</i>

68
00:12:04,063 --> 00:12:08,193
Jan!
Oh, no!

69
00:12:09,602 --> 00:12:12,662
<i>Hana, where're</i>
<i>you going?</i>

70
00:12:12,738 --> 00:12:16,003
- Stay back!
- Stop, Hana!

71
00:12:17,109 --> 00:12:20,340
Stay--

72
00:12:23,782 --> 00:12:26,013
No!

73
00:12:26,086 --> 00:12:28,680
No!

74
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:16,036
- Hey! Hey!
- Don't move!

75
00:13:16,104 --> 00:13:18,072
Don't move!
Don't move!

76
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:20,370
Stand absolutely still!

77
00:13:20,442 --> 00:13:23,172
<i>You're walking in</i>
<i>a mine field!</i>

78
00:13:25,881 --> 00:13:28,349
Good.

79
00:13:28,417 --> 00:13:31,250
That's good.

80
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:34,448
Just stay still
for me...

81
00:13:34,523 --> 00:13:36,787
and we'll be fine.

82
00:13:38,594 --> 00:13:40,859
What are you doing?

83
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:44,093
What the bloody hell do
you think you're doing?

84
00:13:45,301 --> 00:13:48,236
<i>It's Jan's.</i>

85
00:14:15,499 --> 00:14:18,593
<i>Are you in pain?</i>
<i>Do you need something?</i>

86
00:14:18,669 --> 00:14:20,603
- Yes.
- Okay.

87
00:14:22,373 --> 00:14:25,035
Are you okay?

88
00:14:25,109 --> 00:14:28,374
- You and Jan were--
- We keep moving him
in and out of the truck.

89
00:14:28,445 --> 00:14:31,540
Why? He's dying.
What's the point?

90
00:14:31,616 --> 00:14:34,210
We can hardly leave him.
Do you mean leave him?

91
00:14:34,286 --> 00:14:36,880
No, no,
I don't mean leave him.

92
00:14:45,196 --> 00:14:48,825
This will help you.

93
00:14:50,635 --> 00:14:53,126
I must be a curse.

94
00:14:53,204 --> 00:14:56,697
Anybody who loves me...

95
00:14:57,843 --> 00:15:00,676
anybody who gets
close to me--

96
00:15:01,981 --> 00:15:04,211
Oh, I must be cursed.

97
00:15:09,555 --> 00:15:11,489
Which is it?

98
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:41,573
- When he dies, I'll catch up.
- It's not safe here.

99
00:16:41,651 --> 00:16:45,417
The whole country's crawling with
bandits, Germans & God knows what.

100
00:16:45,488 --> 00:16:47,979
- It's madness! I can't allow it.
- The war is over.

101
00:16:48,057 --> 00:16:49,957
How can it be
desertion?

102
00:16:50,026 --> 00:16:53,359
It's not over everywhere.
I didn't mean literally.

103
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:56,456
This is normal, a shock,
for all of us, Hana.

104
00:16:56,533 --> 00:16:59,934
I need morphine, a lot.
And a pistol.

105
00:17:04,742 --> 00:17:07,973
If anything ever happened to you,
I'd never forgive myself.

106
00:17:11,048 --> 00:17:13,812
We're heading
for Leghorn.

107
00:17:13,884 --> 00:17:16,182
''Livorno,''
the Italians call it.

108
00:17:16,253 --> 00:17:19,017
We'll expect you.

109
00:17:28,098 --> 00:17:30,033
Fine.

110
00:17:36,308 --> 00:17:38,742
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, ma'am.

111
00:17:42,013 --> 00:17:44,914
- Oh, Hana.
- I'll be okay.

112
00:17:44,983 --> 00:17:48,009
I'll catch up.
Good.

113
00:18:54,289 --> 00:18:57,190
What-- What was
all that banging?

114
00:18:57,258 --> 00:19:01,888
Are you-- Are you fighting rats
or the entire German army?

115
00:19:03,064 --> 00:19:07,364
No. I was repairing
the stairs.

116
00:19:07,435 --> 00:19:11,702
I found a library,
and the books were very useful.

117
00:19:11,774 --> 00:19:15,141
Before you find too many
uses for those books,

118
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:17,678
you might
read some to me.

119
00:19:17,746 --> 00:19:20,340
I think they're all in Italian,
but I'll look, yes.

120
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:23,078
- What about your own book?
- My book?

121
00:19:23,152 --> 00:19:26,246
Oh, yes,
the Herodotus.

122
00:19:26,322 --> 00:19:29,314
<i>Yes,you can read him.</i>

123
00:19:29,391 --> 00:19:32,383
Oh. I found plums.

124
00:19:32,461 --> 00:19:36,228
We have plums
in the orchard. There.

125
00:19:36,299 --> 00:19:39,097
We have an orchard.

126
00:19:39,169 --> 00:19:43,265
Herodotus is
the father of history.

127
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:46,036
- Do you know that?
- I don't know anything.

128
00:19:56,386 --> 00:19:58,320
Hmm.

129
00:20:06,397 --> 00:20:08,661
<i>It's a</i>--

130
00:20:08,733 --> 00:20:11,998
It's a very plum...

131
00:20:12,069 --> 00:20:14,037
plum.

132
00:21:38,692 --> 00:21:43,630
A mountain the shape
of a woman's back. Good, good.

133
00:22:07,722 --> 00:22:11,250
- Hello, Geoffrey!
- Madox, hello!

134
00:22:11,327 --> 00:22:14,763
- <i>Welcome to the expedition.</i>
- <i>How do you do? Geoffrey Clifton.</i>

135
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:16,229
Splendid to finally
meet you all.

136
00:22:16,298 --> 00:22:18,232
This is Dante D'Agostino and
Diggy Bermann, our archaeologist.

137
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,700
- Beautiful plane.
- This is Sharif Al Fouad, Egyptologist.

138
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:23,762
- And this is my wife, Katharine.
- Hello.

139
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:25,739
<i>We're your</i>
<i>new apprentices.</i>

140
00:22:25,808 --> 00:22:27,299
-<i>Welcome to the International Sand Club.</i>

141
00:22:28,377 --> 00:22:32,143
- To the International Sand Club.
- I'll get cups.

142
00:22:32,214 --> 00:22:34,649
- Marvelous plane. Did you look?
- Yes.

143
00:22:34,718 --> 00:22:37,778
Isn't it? A wedding present
from Katharine's parents.

144
00:22:37,854 --> 00:22:39,913
We're calling it
Rupert Bear.

145
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:42,390
- Hello. Geoffrey Clifton.
- Almasy.

146
00:22:42,459 --> 00:22:45,860
We can finally consign my old bird
to the scrap heap.

147
00:22:45,929 --> 00:22:48,397
<i>Mrs. Clifton,</i>
<i>I'd like to present...</i>

148
00:22:48,465 --> 00:22:51,400
- Count Almasy.
- Hello.

149
00:22:51,468 --> 00:22:54,301
Geoffrey gave me your monograph
and I was reading up in the desert.

150
00:22:54,371 --> 00:22:56,999
- Very impressive.
- Thank you.

151
00:22:57,073 --> 00:23:00,475
I wanted to meet the man who could
write a long paper with so few adjectives.

152
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:04,504
Well, a thing is still a thing,
no matter what you place in front of it.

153
00:23:04,582 --> 00:23:08,518
<i>Big car, slow car,</i>
<i>chauffeur-driven car.</i>

154
00:23:08,586 --> 00:23:11,521
-<i>Broken car.</i>
- It's still a car.

155
00:23:11,589 --> 00:23:14,888
- Not much use, though.
-<i>Love?</i>

156
00:23:14,959 --> 00:23:18,622
Romantic love,
platonic love, filial love.

157
00:23:18,696 --> 00:23:21,164
- Quite different things, surely.
- <i>Uxoriousness.</i>

158
00:23:21,232 --> 00:23:25,727
That's my favorite kind of love.
Excessive love of one's wife.

159
00:23:25,804 --> 00:23:28,004
- Now there you have me.

160
00:23:29,675 --> 00:23:32,269
- They're tourists.
- Absolute rot.

161
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:34,812
They're highly recommended
by the Royal Geographic Society.

162
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,871
She's charming and
has read everything.

163
00:23:36,949 --> 00:23:39,782
- He's meant to be a ruddy good flier.
- We don't need another pilot.

164
00:23:39,852 --> 00:23:41,877
He can make aerial maps
of the whole route.

165
00:23:41,954 --> 00:23:44,616
<i>You can't explore</i>
<i>from the air, Madox.</i>

166
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:47,682
<i>If you could explore from the air,</i>
<i>life would be very simple.</i>

167
00:23:48,694 --> 00:23:50,184
Contact.

168
00:23:52,265 --> 00:23:54,233
Contact.

169
00:25:10,947 --> 00:25:13,438
I should try
and move the bed.

170
00:25:13,516 --> 00:25:16,007
I want you to be able
to see the view.

171
00:25:16,085 --> 00:25:19,316
It's good. It's a view
from a monastery.

172
00:25:19,388 --> 00:25:22,846
- I can already see.
- How?

173
00:25:22,925 --> 00:25:25,655
- How can you see anything?
- No, no, not the window.

174
00:25:25,728 --> 00:25:28,424
I can't bear
the light anyway.

175
00:25:28,497 --> 00:25:30,988
I can see all the way
to the desert.

176
00:25:31,067 --> 00:25:32,968
I'm turning you.

177
00:25:33,036 --> 00:25:36,403
Exploring before the war,
making maps.

178
00:25:36,473 --> 00:25:38,138
Is there sand in my eyes?

179
00:25:38,138 --> 00:25:39,704
Are you cleaning sand from my ears?

180
00:25:39,776 --> 00:25:43,303
No sand.
That's your morphine speaking.

181
00:25:50,554 --> 00:25:53,682
I can see my wife
in that view.

182
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:59,152
Are you
remembering more?

183
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:02,495
- Could I have a cigarette?
- Are you crazy?

184
00:26:06,671 --> 00:26:11,438
Why-- Why are you so determined
to keep me alive?

185
00:26:11,509 --> 00:26:14,967
Because I'm a nurse.

186
00:27:03,863 --> 00:27:05,330
<i>Bravo.</i>

187
00:27:05,398 --> 00:27:07,992
We have an
old-fashioned tomato

188
00:27:08,068 --> 00:27:10,468
A Long Island potato

189
00:27:10,537 --> 00:27:13,666
<i>But yes</i>
<i>We have no bananas</i>

190
00:27:13,741 --> 00:27:16,005
<i>We have no bananas today</i>

191
00:27:28,989 --> 00:27:30,820
- <i>Next!</i>
- <i>Katharine!</i>

192
00:27:30,991 --> 00:27:33,926
''The King insisted that
he would find some way...

193
00:27:33,994 --> 00:27:35,985
''to prove beyond dispute...

194
00:27:36,063 --> 00:27:40,194
''that his wife
was fairest of all women.

195
00:27:40,268 --> 00:27:43,897
'''I will hide you in your room
where we sleep,' said Candaules--

196
00:27:43,972 --> 00:27:46,566
- said Candaules.''
- Candaules.

197
00:27:46,641 --> 00:27:49,269
''Candaules.''

198
00:27:49,344 --> 00:27:51,471
Candaules.

199
00:27:51,546 --> 00:27:52,539
Candaules tells Gyges

200
00:27:55,539 --> 00:27:55,617
that the Queen has
the same practice every night.

201
00:27:55,617 --> 00:27:58,586
She takes off
her clothes...

202
00:27:58,653 --> 00:28:02,589
and puts them on the chair
by the door to her room.

203
00:28:02,657 --> 00:28:05,126
<i>''And from where you stand,</i>

204
00:28:05,194 --> 00:28:08,721
<i>you will be able to gaze</i>
<i>on her at your leisure. '''</i>

205
00:28:10,166 --> 00:28:13,727
And that evening, it's exactly as
the King has told him.

206
00:28:13,803 --> 00:28:15,737
She goes
to the chair,

207
00:28:15,805 --> 00:28:17,932
removes her clothes
one by one,

208
00:28:18,007 --> 00:28:22,034
until she's standing naked
in full view of Gyges.

209
00:28:22,111 --> 00:28:26,775
And indeed, she was more lovely
than he could have imagined.

210
00:28:26,849 --> 00:28:30,445
But then,
the Queen looked up...

211
00:28:30,521 --> 00:28:34,651
and saw Gyges concealed
in the shadows.

212
00:28:34,725 --> 00:28:37,319
And although she said
nothing, she shuddered.

213
00:28:43,467 --> 00:28:45,697
And the next day,

214
00:28:45,769 --> 00:28:49,500
she sends for-- for Gyges
and challenged him.

215
00:28:49,573 --> 00:28:53,976
-<i>And hearing his story,</i>
<i>this is what she said.</i>
- Off with his head!

216
00:28:58,249 --> 00:29:01,275
She said, ''Either you
must submit to death...

217
00:29:01,352 --> 00:29:04,287
''for gazing on that
which you should not,

218
00:29:04,355 --> 00:29:06,880
''or else kill my husband
who has shamed me...

219
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:11,854
<i>and become King</i>
<i>in his place. ''</i>

220
00:29:14,065 --> 00:29:16,693
So Gyges kills the King,

221
00:29:16,768 --> 00:29:20,899
marries the Queen and becomes
ruler of Lydia for 28 years.

222
00:29:22,875 --> 00:29:24,809
The end.

223
00:29:27,446 --> 00:29:30,176
Shall I spin
the bottle?

224
00:29:30,249 --> 00:29:32,843
So, Geoffrey,
let that be a lesson to you.

225
00:29:32,918 --> 00:29:35,352
- D'Agostino!
- D'Agostino!

226
00:29:36,555 --> 00:29:38,989
<i>Are you asleep?</i>

227
00:29:40,059 --> 00:29:42,653
Yes.

228
00:29:42,728 --> 00:29:45,994
No. I'm dropping off.

229
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:31,443
Go away!

230
00:30:31,512 --> 00:30:34,140
Go! Go!

231
00:30:48,864 --> 00:30:50,832
<i>Buon giorno.</i>

232
00:30:52,034 --> 00:30:55,003
- <i>Hana?</i>
- What do you want?

233
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:58,005
I met your friend Mary.

234
00:30:58,073 --> 00:31:01,338
She said I should stop and see
if you were all right.

235
00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:06,212
<i>Apparently we're neighbors. My house</i>
<i>is two blocks from yours in Montreal.</i>

236
00:31:06,282 --> 00:31:08,978
<i>Cabot, north of Laurier.</i>

237
00:31:09,052 --> 00:31:11,919
- <i>Bonjour.</i>
- <i>Bonjour.</i>

238
00:31:14,223 --> 00:31:16,248
For you.

239
00:31:16,326 --> 00:31:18,521
<i>I'd like to take credit for it,</i>
<i>but it's from Mary.</i>

240
00:31:18,594 --> 00:31:22,189
My name is David Caravaggio,
but nobody ever called me David.

241
00:31:22,265 --> 00:31:26,861
Caravaggio they find
too absurd to miss out on.

242
00:31:26,936 --> 00:31:28,598
Oh!

243
00:31:28,672 --> 00:31:31,140
Oh!

244
00:31:31,208 --> 00:31:33,438
Oh, shit.
Stupid hands.

245
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:36,911
<i>Let me do that.</i>

246
00:31:42,653 --> 00:31:45,315
They're fresh.

247
00:31:45,389 --> 00:31:47,823
I haven't had
an egg in--

248
00:31:50,294 --> 00:31:52,819
Have you noticed
there are chickens?

249
00:31:52,896 --> 00:31:55,092
In Italy, you get chickens
but no eggs.

250
00:31:55,166 --> 00:31:57,964
In Africa, they're always eggs
but never chickens.

251
00:31:58,036 --> 00:32:01,472
- Who's separating them?
- You were in Africa?

252
00:32:01,539 --> 00:32:03,404
Yes, I was.

253
00:32:03,475 --> 00:32:06,444
So was my patient.

254
00:32:06,511 --> 00:32:09,503
Look, I'd like to
stay for a while.

255
00:32:09,581 --> 00:32:11,549
I have to do
some work here.

256
00:32:11,616 --> 00:32:14,983
<i>I speak the language.</i>
<i>There are partisans to be disarmed.</i>

257
00:32:15,053 --> 00:32:18,854
We embrace them and see
if we can relieve them of their weapons,

258
00:32:18,924 --> 00:32:20,983
you know,
while we hide.

259
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:24,621
I was a thief, so the army
thought I'd be good at it.

260
00:32:24,697 --> 00:32:27,495
- So you can shoot a pistol?
- No.

261
00:32:27,566 --> 00:32:30,433
Do you have a problem
with those?

262
00:32:32,271 --> 00:32:33,738
No.

263
00:32:33,806 --> 00:32:36,434
- I should look at them before you go.
- <i>Look.</i>

264
00:32:36,509 --> 00:32:38,909
It's a big place.
We needn't disturb each other.

265
00:32:38,978 --> 00:32:41,242
<i>I'll sleep in the stable.</i>

266
00:32:41,313 --> 00:32:43,338
It doesn't matter where I sleep.
I don't sleep.

267
00:32:43,416 --> 00:32:46,511
I don't know what Mary told you
about me, but I don't need company.

268
00:32:46,586 --> 00:32:49,680
I don't need
to be looked after.

269
00:32:53,827 --> 00:32:57,058
There is a man
downstairs.

270
00:32:57,130 --> 00:33:00,531
He brought us eggs.
He might stay.

271
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:03,467
Why?
Can he lay eggs?

272
00:33:03,537 --> 00:33:05,630
He's Canadian.

273
00:33:05,705 --> 00:33:07,155
Why are people always so happy

274
00:33:07,155 --> 00:33:09,733
when they collide with
one from the same place?

275
00:33:09,811 --> 00:33:12,712
What happened in Montreal when
you passed a man in the street?

276
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:15,874
Did you invite him
to live with you?

277
00:33:17,285 --> 00:33:19,583
He needn't
disturb you.

278
00:33:19,654 --> 00:33:22,214
He can't.
I'm already disturbed.

279
00:33:25,159 --> 00:33:29,061
There's a war. Where you come from
becomes important.

280
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:32,691
<i>Why? I hate that idea.</i>

281
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,809
Ah!
It's gonna work.

282
00:33:41,877 --> 00:33:44,471
<i>Gently.</i>

283
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:50,518
Can I help?

284
00:33:50,586 --> 00:33:52,486
It's finished.

285
00:33:52,554 --> 00:33:54,818
So, you're our
Canadian pickpocket?

286
00:33:54,890 --> 00:33:57,552
<i>Thief</i> I think
is more accurate.

287
00:33:57,626 --> 00:34:02,223
I understand you were in Africa.
Whereabouts?

288
00:34:02,298 --> 00:34:04,892
Oh, all over.

289
00:34:04,968 --> 00:34:08,233
All over?

290
00:34:08,304 --> 00:34:11,831
I kept trying to cover
a very modest portion and still failed.

291
00:34:11,908 --> 00:34:14,877
-<i>Are you leaving us?</i>
- Yes.

292
00:34:14,944 --> 00:34:17,504
Now's our opportunity
to swap war wounds.

293
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:20,879
Then I'm definitely going.

294
00:34:24,454 --> 00:34:27,288
Does she have
war wounds?

295
00:34:27,358 --> 00:34:29,588
I think anybody
she ever loves...

296
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:31,958
<i>tends to die on her.</i>

297
00:34:32,029 --> 00:34:35,055
-<i>Are you planning to be the exception?</i>
- <i>Me?</i>

298
00:34:35,132 --> 00:34:37,430
<i>I think you've got...</i>

299
00:34:37,501 --> 00:34:39,799
the wrong end
of the stick, old boy.

300
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:42,634
<i>So...</i>

301
00:34:42,706 --> 00:34:44,640
<i>Caravaggio.</i>

302
00:34:44,708 --> 00:34:47,973
Hana thinks
you invented your name.

303
00:34:48,045 --> 00:34:50,639
And you've
forgotten yours.

304
00:34:50,714 --> 00:34:55,846
I said that no one would ever invent
such a preposterous name.

305
00:34:55,921 --> 00:34:58,253
And I said you can
forget everything,

306
00:34:59,824 --> 00:35:02,793
but you never forget
your name.

307
00:35:02,861 --> 00:35:05,227
Count Almasy.

308
00:35:05,297 --> 00:35:07,629
<i>That name mean</i>
<i>anything to you?</i>

309
00:35:07,699 --> 00:35:10,065
<i>Or Katharine Clifton?</i>

310
00:35:18,678 --> 00:35:20,612
Oh, I'm sorry.

311
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:23,843
- How much did you pay?
- Oh, hello.

312
00:35:23,916 --> 00:35:27,818
They don't see foreign women
in this market. How much did you pay?

313
00:35:27,887 --> 00:35:30,583
Um, ¢G7, ¢G8, I suppose.

314
00:35:30,656 --> 00:35:33,090
- Which store?
- Why?

315
00:35:33,159 --> 00:35:36,526
You've been cheated.
Oh, don't worry, we'll take it back.

316
00:35:36,596 --> 00:35:38,530
I don't want
to take it back.

317
00:35:38,598 --> 00:35:41,830
- This is not worth ¢G8.
- It is to me.

318
00:35:41,902 --> 00:35:44,393
- Did you bargain?
- I don't care to bargain.

319
00:35:44,471 --> 00:35:46,666
That insults them.

320
00:35:48,275 --> 00:35:51,972
I don't believe that. I think
that you're insulted by me somehow.

321
00:35:52,045 --> 00:35:55,412
I'd be very happy to obtain
the correct price for this.

322
00:35:55,482 --> 00:35:58,178
I apologize
if I appear abrupt.

323
00:35:58,251 --> 00:36:00,651
I'm rusty at social graces.

324
00:36:05,092 --> 00:36:07,117
How do you find Cairo?

325
00:36:07,195 --> 00:36:10,995
- Did you visit the pyramids?
- Excuse me.

326
00:36:11,065 --> 00:36:13,727
Or the Sphinx?

327
00:36:16,938 --> 00:36:21,272
<i>Latitude, 25, 33.</i>
<i>Longitude, 25, 1 6.</i>

328
00:36:21,342 --> 00:36:25,278
<i>We attempt to drive northeast of Kofer,</i>
<i>we'll leave our bones in the desert.</i>

329
00:36:25,346 --> 00:36:27,780
- I disagree.
- You're Hungarian. You always disagree.

330
00:36:27,849 --> 00:36:29,908
- Good evening, gentlemen.
- Good evening.

331
00:36:29,984 --> 00:36:32,077
- How is your charming wife?
- <i>Marvelous.</i>

332
00:36:32,153 --> 00:36:34,452
She's in love
with the hotel plumbing.

333
00:36:34,523 --> 00:36:36,650
<i>She's either in the swimming pool.</i>
<i>She swims for hours.</i>

334
00:36:36,725 --> 00:36:39,660
She's a fish. It's quite incredible.
Or she's in the bath.

335
00:36:39,728 --> 00:36:42,856
Actually, she's just outside.

336
00:36:44,266 --> 00:36:46,496
Chaps only
in the Long Bar.

337
00:36:50,939 --> 00:36:52,907
Mrs. Clifton.

338
00:36:52,975 --> 00:36:57,435
<i>You'll have to forgive us. We're not</i>
<i>accustomed to the company of women.</i>

339
00:36:57,513 --> 00:37:01,211
Not at all. I was thoroughly
enjoying my book.

340
00:37:01,284 --> 00:37:04,151
- The team is in mourning, darling.
- Oh, really?

341
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:07,553
I'm afraid we're not having much luck
obtaining funds for the expedition.

342
00:37:07,624 --> 00:37:09,558
Oh. Well, what'll you do?

343
00:37:09,626 --> 00:37:12,060
More modest expedition,
or even wait a year.

344
00:37:12,128 --> 00:37:15,120
- It's a disaster.
- Remind our families we still exist.

345
00:37:15,198 --> 00:37:17,189
Good heavens,
are you married, Madox?

346
00:37:17,267 --> 00:37:20,395
Very much so.
We all are.

347
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:22,904
-<i>Save my friend Almasy here.</i>
- I feel much better.

348
00:37:22,972 --> 00:37:26,704
Don't you, darling?
We were feeling rather self-conscious.

349
00:37:26,777 --> 00:37:28,904
Let's toast, then.
Absent wives.

350
00:37:28,979 --> 00:37:31,709
- Absent wives.
- And present ones.

351
00:37:31,782 --> 00:37:33,409
And future ones.

352
00:37:54,473 --> 00:37:56,407
Thank you.

353
00:37:56,475 --> 00:37:59,273
Excuse me.
May I?

354
00:38:13,925 --> 00:38:17,327
- Why did you follow me yesterday?
- I'm sorry. What?

355
00:38:17,396 --> 00:38:19,990
After the market,
you followed me to the hotel.

356
00:38:20,066 --> 00:38:24,196
I was concerned. A woman in that
part of Cairo, a European woman.

357
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:26,761
- I felt obliged to.
- You felt obliged to?

358
00:38:26,839 --> 00:38:29,706
As the wife of
one of our party.

359
00:38:29,776 --> 00:38:32,836
So why follow me?
Escort me, by all means.

360
00:38:32,912 --> 00:38:36,177
But following me
is predatory, isn't it?

361
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:22,020
Could I ask you
to move?

362
00:39:23,097 --> 00:39:25,224
I'm sorry, but I--

363
00:39:27,035 --> 00:39:30,004
I'm sorry.
Of course.

364
00:39:30,071 --> 00:39:33,007
- <i>It's just when you move.</i>
- How stupid of me.

365
00:39:33,075 --> 00:39:37,705
- I can't really bear the pressure--
- Are you all right?

366
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:40,112
I was dreaming.
Awful.

367
00:40:30,868 --> 00:40:32,802
Hana.

368
00:40:35,506 --> 00:40:39,101
Hana, are you
all right?

369
00:40:39,176 --> 00:40:41,770
Leave me alone.

370
00:41:02,834 --> 00:41:05,098
You're in love with him,
aren't you?

371
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:08,230
<i>Your poor patient.</i>

372
00:41:08,307 --> 00:41:11,242
<i>You think he's a saint</i>
<i>because of the way he looks.</i>

373
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:14,405
I don't think he is.

374
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,778
I'm not so
in love with him.

375
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:21,149
I'm in love with ghosts.

376
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:24,314
So is he.
He's in love with ghosts.

377
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:26,688
What if I told you
he did this to me?

378
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:33,195
How could he have?
When?

379
00:41:33,266 --> 00:41:35,826
I'm one of his ghosts,
and he wouldn't even know it.

380
00:41:35,902 --> 00:41:39,805
- I don't know what that means.
-<i>Ask your saint who he is.</i>

381
00:41:40,808 --> 00:41:43,140
Ask him
who he's killed.

382
00:41:46,413 --> 00:41:50,850
Please, don't creep
around this house.

383
00:41:50,918 --> 00:41:53,318
<i>See, I don't think</i>
<i>he's forgotten anything!</i>

384
00:41:53,387 --> 00:41:56,254
<i>I think he</i> wants <i>to forget!</i>

385
00:41:58,192 --> 00:42:00,490
<i>Gentlemen, to mapmaking.</i>

386
00:42:00,561 --> 00:42:02,461
To mapmaking!

387
00:42:02,529 --> 00:42:04,896
And a special thank you
to Geoffrey and Katharine,

388
00:42:04,966 --> 00:42:09,164
without whose fund-raising heroics,
we'd still be kicking our heels.

389
00:42:09,237 --> 00:42:11,671
- To arm-twisting.
- Arm-twisting.

390
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:15,836
Did Katharine say Geoffrey
has to fly back to Cairo?

391
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:18,674
Return the favor.
Take a few photographs for the army.

392
00:42:18,747 --> 00:42:21,147
Oh, um, what kind
of photographs?

393
00:42:21,216 --> 00:42:23,150
Portraits.

394
00:42:23,218 --> 00:42:25,686
The brigadier,
the brigadier's wife,

395
00:42:25,754 --> 00:42:29,782
the brigadier's dog, brigadier
by the pyramids, brigadier breathing.

396
00:42:29,859 --> 00:42:32,350
<i>And I shall,</i>
<i>of course, be bereft.</i>

397
00:42:32,428 --> 00:42:35,261
I'll finally be able to
explore the Cairo nightlife.

398
00:42:35,331 --> 00:42:38,266
I shall produce an authoritative guide
to the zinc bars and--

399
00:42:38,334 --> 00:42:41,064
I want to say <i>hareems.</i> Are we
in the right country for <i>hareems</i>?

400
00:42:41,137 --> 00:42:43,105
<i>Harems.</i>

401
00:42:48,210 --> 00:42:50,770
- Bye, my love.
- Travel safe.

402
00:42:50,846 --> 00:42:53,110
Catch up
in a week.

403
00:42:55,752 --> 00:42:59,085
Clifton, safe journey.

404
00:42:59,156 --> 00:43:03,422
You too. Good luck.
Glad the funds have turned up.

405
00:43:03,493 --> 00:43:06,462
Clifton.

406
00:43:09,566 --> 00:43:12,160
This is probably
none of my business.

407
00:43:12,235 --> 00:43:15,068
Your wife.

408
00:43:15,138 --> 00:43:18,437
- Think it's appropriate to leave her?
- Appropriate?

409
00:43:18,508 --> 00:43:22,275
Well, the desert is, it's, uh--
for a woman, it's very tough.

410
00:43:22,346 --> 00:43:24,610
I wonder if it's
not too much for her.

411
00:43:24,682 --> 00:43:27,173
Are you mad? Katharine loves it here.
She told me yesterday.

412
00:43:27,251 --> 00:43:30,277
- All the same, were I you--
- I've known Katharine
since she was three.

413
00:43:30,354 --> 00:43:33,050
We were practically brother and sister
before we were man and wife.

414
00:43:33,124 --> 00:43:35,558
I think I'd know what is and what isn't
too much for her.

415
00:43:35,626 --> 00:43:38,459
I think
she'd know herself.

416
00:43:38,529 --> 00:43:40,497
Very well.

417
00:43:40,565 --> 00:43:43,466
Why are you people
so threatened by a woman?

418
00:44:26,112 --> 00:44:28,307
I have come to love...

419
00:44:28,381 --> 00:44:32,181
that little tap of the
fingernail against the syringe.

420
00:44:33,253 --> 00:44:35,984
Tap.

421
00:44:36,056 --> 00:44:38,923
Tap.

422
00:44:38,993 --> 00:44:40,927
Tap.

423
00:45:01,650 --> 00:45:05,279
Stop playing! Please, stop playing.

424
00:45:09,958 --> 00:45:12,893
I don't have the key
to that door. You--

425
00:45:15,830 --> 00:45:19,095
The Germans were here.
The Germans were all over this area.

426
00:45:19,167 --> 00:45:21,635
They left mines
everywhere.

427
00:45:21,703 --> 00:45:24,194
And pianos were their
favorite hiding places.

428
00:45:24,272 --> 00:45:26,707
I see.
Sorry.

429
00:45:32,014 --> 00:45:35,780
Then maybe you're safe
as long as you only play Bach.

430
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:39,450
He's German.

431
00:45:40,656 --> 00:45:43,352
Is something funny?

432
00:45:43,426 --> 00:45:45,826
No. I'm sorry.

433
00:46:00,444 --> 00:46:02,742
I've met you before.

434
00:46:02,813 --> 00:46:06,305
I don't think so.

435
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:18,529
Look. See?

436
00:46:18,596 --> 00:46:21,622
Move that,
and no more Bach.

437
00:46:21,699 --> 00:46:25,135
Lieutenant!
Are you all right, sir?

438
00:46:25,203 --> 00:46:27,671
<i>Fine, Sergeant.</i>

439
00:46:27,739 --> 00:46:29,639
So you're working
with the Italians.

440
00:46:29,707 --> 00:46:31,800
Yeah, trying to get them
to give up their weapons.

441
00:46:31,876 --> 00:46:34,572
<i>I was a thief,so the army</i>
<i>thought I'd be good at it.</i>

442
00:46:34,646 --> 00:46:37,046
<i>I like the Italians.</i>

443
00:46:37,115 --> 00:46:39,413
<i>He wants us to move out.</i>

444
00:46:39,484 --> 00:46:42,977
He says there could be
50 more mines in the building.

445
00:46:43,055 --> 00:46:47,424
<i>He thinks I'm mad</i>
<i>because I laugh at him.</i>

446
00:46:47,493 --> 00:46:50,485
He's Indian.

447
00:46:50,562 --> 00:46:54,396
- He wears a turban.
- No, he's Sikh.

448
00:46:54,466 --> 00:46:56,900
<i>Ifhe wears a turban,</i>
<i>he's Sikh.</i>

449
00:46:56,969 --> 00:46:58,994
I'll probably marry him.

450
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:02,268
Really?
That's sudden.

451
00:47:02,341 --> 00:47:04,332
My mother
always told me...

452
00:47:04,410 --> 00:47:08,142
I would summon my husband
by playing the piano.

453
00:47:14,354 --> 00:47:18,290
- I liked it better when
there were just the two of us.
- Why? Is he staying?

454
00:47:18,358 --> 00:47:21,088
With his sergeant,
a Mr. Hardy.

455
00:47:22,462 --> 00:47:26,421
We should charge.
Doesn't anyone have a job to do?

456
00:47:26,499 --> 00:47:30,435
They have to clear all the roads
of mines. That's a big job.

457
00:47:30,503 --> 00:47:33,701
<i>In that case, I</i>--
<i>I suppose we can't charge.</i>

458
00:47:33,774 --> 00:47:36,265
No, we can't.

459
00:47:39,146 --> 00:47:41,614
Thank you.

460
00:48:21,356 --> 00:48:23,790
Flat foot floogee
with the floy floy

461
00:48:28,698 --> 00:48:31,394
Flat foot floogee
with the floy floy

462
00:48:31,467 --> 00:48:33,992
Flat foot floogee
with the floy floy

463
00:48:34,070 --> 00:48:34,439
I've been thinking.

464
00:48:34,439 --> 00:48:38,439
How does someone
like you decide to come to the desert?

465
00:48:38,508 --> 00:48:40,408
What is it? You--

466
00:48:40,476 --> 00:48:43,741
You're doing whatever you're doing in
your castle, or wherever it is you live,

467
00:48:43,813 --> 00:48:47,476
and one day you say,
''I have to get to the desert,'' or what?

468
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:52,284
I once traveled with a guide
who was taking me to Faya.

469
00:48:52,356 --> 00:48:56,224
He didn't speak
for nine hours.

470
00:48:58,729 --> 00:49:03,428
<i>At the end of it, he pointed</i>
<i>at the horizon and said, ''Faya. ''</i>

471
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:06,435
That was a good day.

472
00:49:17,081 --> 00:49:19,641
Actually, you sing.

473
00:49:21,486 --> 00:49:23,977
- What?
- You sing.

474
00:49:24,055 --> 00:49:26,523
All the time.

475
00:49:26,591 --> 00:49:28,718
- I do not.
- Ask Al Auf.

476
00:49:30,094 --> 00:49:32,062
Al Auf!.

477
00:49:43,976 --> 00:49:46,968
<i>You'd better be ready</i>
<i>about half past 8:00</i>

478
00:49:47,046 --> 00:49:49,241
Remember, honey
Don't be late

479
00:49:49,315 --> 00:49:53,081
'Cause I'll be there
when the band starts playing

480
00:49:53,152 --> 00:49:55,177
Gonna dance off
both my shoes

481
00:49:55,254 --> 00:49:57,654
When they play
theJelly Roll blues

482
00:49:57,723 --> 00:50:02,490
<i>Tomorrow night at the</i>
<i>dark-town strutter's ball</i>

483
00:50:15,008 --> 00:50:17,602
Give me your hand.

484
00:50:19,513 --> 00:50:21,447
Thanks.

485
00:51:57,581 --> 00:52:00,311

<i>Madox!</i>

- Come quickly! I've found something!
- What is it?

489
00:52:07,925 --> 00:52:11,884
D'Ag! Bermann!
Quick!

490
00:52:29,114 --> 00:52:31,105
My God.

491
00:52:32,817 --> 00:52:35,081
They're swimming.

492
00:52:40,126 --> 00:52:42,560
<i>They're swimming.</i>

493
00:53:11,324 --> 00:53:13,383
Ow!

494
00:53:16,229 --> 00:53:19,596
- You okay?
- Yeah.

495
00:53:44,797 --> 00:53:46,958
<i>How do you explain...</i>

496
00:53:47,032 --> 00:53:50,297
to someone who has
never been here,

497
00:53:50,369 --> 00:53:54,898
feelings which seem
quite normal?

498
00:53:57,978 --> 00:54:01,311
I don't know,
my friend.

499
00:54:01,381 --> 00:54:03,906
I don't know.

500
00:54:07,387 --> 00:54:09,685
- Aaah!
- Kamal!

501
00:54:09,756 --> 00:54:11,849
<i>Bermann,</i>
<i>what are you doing?</i>

502
00:54:11,925 --> 00:54:14,052
Bermann!

503
00:54:15,829 --> 00:54:18,024
Watch out!
Watch out!

504
00:54:27,842 --> 00:54:31,278
- Get them out of the car!
- Let me help!

505
00:54:31,345 --> 00:54:33,711
Almasy,
are you all right?

506
00:54:33,781 --> 00:54:36,841
Yes, yes,
I'm fine.

507
00:54:38,486 --> 00:54:41,512
My wrist!
Ah!

508
00:54:55,203 --> 00:55:00,038
I'll be back as quick as I can,
36 hours at the outside.

509
00:55:00,108 --> 00:55:02,372
Try to get
an additional radiator.

510
00:55:02,444 --> 00:55:07,347
We can store it between here
and Pottery Hill. And a better jack.

511
00:55:07,416 --> 00:55:10,875
- We planned badly.
- Bermann?

512
00:55:24,334 --> 00:55:26,234
Safe journey.

513
00:55:28,905 --> 00:55:30,998
Now what?

514
00:55:31,074 --> 00:55:34,305
<i>Let's get all</i>
<i>this stuff off.</i>

515
00:55:34,377 --> 00:55:37,347
- I'll stay behind, of course.
- Certainly not.

516
00:55:37,414 --> 00:55:40,349
- I caused the problem. I shall stay.
- You can't. None of you can.

517
00:55:40,417 --> 00:55:43,284
<i>No, I insist. There clearly</i>
<i>isn't room for all of us.</i>

518
00:55:43,354 --> 00:55:46,323
I'm the least able to dig, and I'm
not one of the walking wounded.

519
00:55:46,390 --> 00:55:48,324
It's only one night.

520
00:55:48,392 --> 00:55:51,828
If I remain, it's the most effective
method of persuading my husband...

521
00:55:51,895 --> 00:55:55,331
to abandon whatever he's doing
and come and rescue us.

522
00:55:55,399 --> 00:55:57,993
- All right.
- Come on, let's get going.

523
00:56:42,248 --> 00:56:45,649
I thought you might like to
paste them into your book.

524
00:56:52,392 --> 00:56:54,860
<i>Well, we</i>--

525
00:56:54,928 --> 00:56:57,396
We took
photographs.

526
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:01,897
There's no need.

527
00:57:03,036 --> 00:57:05,596
No, really.
I'd like you to have them.

528
00:57:05,672 --> 00:57:08,163
Well, there's really no need.
This is, um--

529
00:57:08,241 --> 00:57:12,041
<i>This is just a scrapbook.</i>
<i>They are too good.</i>

530
00:57:12,112 --> 00:57:15,843
I should feel obliged.
Thank you.

531
00:57:30,498 --> 00:57:33,626
And that would be unconscionable,
I suppose, wouldn't it?

532
00:57:33,701 --> 00:57:36,295
To feel any obligation.

533
00:57:39,507 --> 00:57:42,442
Yes, of course it would.

534
00:58:11,908 --> 00:58:14,433
You should come
into the shelter.

535
00:58:14,511 --> 00:58:16,502
I'm quite all right,
thank you.

536
00:58:16,579 --> 00:58:20,447
- Look over there.
- What am I looking at?

537
00:58:20,517 --> 00:58:22,883
Do you see what's happening
to them, the stars?

538
00:58:22,952 --> 00:58:26,444
- They're so untidy.
I was trying to rearrange them.
- <i>No, no.</i>

539
00:58:26,523 --> 00:58:28,491
Over there.

540
00:58:32,495 --> 00:58:35,090
<i>In a few minutes,</i>
<i>there'll be no stars.</i>

541
00:58:35,165 --> 00:58:37,531
The air
is filling with sand.

542
00:59:40,666 --> 00:59:44,295
- This is not very good, is it?
- No.

543
00:59:47,707 --> 00:59:51,337
- Will we be all right?
- Yes.

544
00:59:51,411 --> 00:59:53,345
Yes.

545
00:59:54,348 --> 00:59:56,612
Absolutely.

546
00:59:56,683 --> 01:00:00,050
''Yes'' is a comfort.
''Absolutely'' is not.

547
01:00:16,204 --> 01:00:19,571
<i>Let me tell you</i>
<i>about winds.</i>

548
01:00:19,641 --> 01:00:22,508
<i>There is a, a whirlwind</i>
<i>from southern Morocco,</i>

549
01:00:22,577 --> 01:00:24,841
the Aajej,

550
01:00:24,912 --> 01:00:28,678
against which the Fellahin
defend themselves with knives.

551
01:00:30,418 --> 01:00:34,354
And there is a,
a Ghibli from Tunis.

552
01:00:34,422 --> 01:00:36,754
- A Ghibli?
- A Ghibli.

553
01:00:36,824 --> 01:00:40,590
Which rolls and rolls
and rolls and produces a--

554
01:00:40,662 --> 01:00:44,121
a rather strange nervous condition.

555
01:00:46,301 --> 01:00:50,328
And then there is the,
the Harmatten,

556
01:00:50,406 --> 01:00:55,207
a red wind, which mariners call
''the sea of darkness.''

557
01:00:56,478 --> 01:00:58,469
And red sand
from this wind...

558
01:00:58,547 --> 01:01:01,448
has flown as far as
the south coast of England,

559
01:01:01,517 --> 01:01:03,951
apparently producing...

560
01:01:04,019 --> 01:01:07,421
showers so dense that they were
mistaken for blood.

561
01:01:07,490 --> 01:01:10,254
Fiction!

562
01:01:10,326 --> 01:01:14,353
We have a house on that coast
and it has never rained blood.

563
01:01:14,431 --> 01:01:17,366
No, it's all true.
Herodotus, your friend.

564
01:01:17,434 --> 01:01:19,698
- My friend.
- Your fri--

565
01:01:19,769 --> 01:01:22,363
He writes about it...

566
01:01:22,439 --> 01:01:25,897
and he writes about...

567
01:01:25,975 --> 01:01:29,376
a, a wind, the Simoon,

568
01:01:29,446 --> 01:01:32,143
which a nation thought
was so evil,

569
01:01:32,216 --> 01:01:35,652
they declared war on it
and marched out against it.

570
01:01:37,021 --> 01:01:39,353
In full battle dress.

571
01:01:41,559 --> 01:01:44,426
<i>Their swords raised.</i>

572
01:02:08,754 --> 01:02:12,690
Katharine, Katharine, I need
to get out your side, quickly.

573
01:02:12,758 --> 01:02:15,124
A car!
Let me out!

574
01:02:15,193 --> 01:02:17,957
Of course.
I'm sorry.

575
01:02:18,029 --> 01:02:20,259
Ridiculous
to fall asleep!

576
01:02:20,332 --> 01:02:22,391
Unforgivable!

577
01:02:22,467 --> 01:02:24,902
Damn!
The flare!

578
01:02:26,272 --> 01:02:28,206
Stop!
Over here!

579
01:02:28,274 --> 01:02:30,504
<i>Here!</i>

580
01:02:30,576 --> 01:02:32,067
- Stop!

581
01:02:33,146 --> 01:02:36,274
Madox!

582
01:02:36,349 --> 01:02:39,750
<i>Madox! Madox!</i>

583
01:02:53,267 --> 01:02:55,462
Our tracks
have disappeared.

584
01:02:55,536 --> 01:02:59,028
Madox will calculate how many miles.
He'll soon turn around.

585
01:03:04,011 --> 01:03:06,980
Could I ask you,
please, to...

586
01:03:07,047 --> 01:03:10,483
paste your paintings
into my book.

587
01:03:10,551 --> 01:03:12,746
<i>I</i>-- <i>I should like</i>
<i>to have them.</i>

588
01:03:12,820 --> 01:03:15,289
I should be honored.

589
01:03:18,959 --> 01:03:21,122
- The others!

590
01:03:22,297 --> 01:03:24,788
- Oh, God.
- <i>Quick!</i>

591
01:03:28,903 --> 01:03:32,737
Oh, how awful!
We've got to get them out.

592
01:03:32,807 --> 01:03:35,537
Quick!
Get the other shovel!

593
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:42,117
Am I a terrible coward
to ask how much water we have left?

594
01:03:42,184 --> 01:03:46,143
A little in our can. We have, uh, water
in the radiator, which can be drunk.

595
01:03:46,222 --> 01:03:50,420
And, uh, that's not cowardly at all.
It's extremely practical.

596
01:03:50,492 --> 01:03:53,859
We, uh-- Oh, come on!
Come on!

597
01:03:55,429 --> 01:03:57,956
- There's also a plant.

598
01:03:58,033 --> 01:04:02,402
I've never seen it,
but I believe you can cut a piece
the size of a heart from this plant,

599
01:04:02,471 --> 01:04:05,908
and the next morning it'll be filled
with a delicious liquid.

600
01:04:05,976 --> 01:04:09,810
Find that plant,
cut out its heart.

601
01:04:13,750 --> 01:04:16,685
Here.

602
01:04:22,025 --> 01:04:24,391
Here's the window.

603
01:04:24,461 --> 01:04:27,430
<i>Clear the glass. I'll clear the door.</i>
<i>Mind your hands.</i>

604
01:04:27,497 --> 01:04:30,558
It's okay. We're here.

605
01:04:30,635 --> 01:04:33,195
Come on,
clear it quickly.

606
01:04:35,273 --> 01:04:38,265
Hang on.
Coming.

607
01:04:46,617 --> 01:04:50,747
- I've got it. I've got it.
- Help them out. Here.

608
01:06:00,961 --> 01:06:03,327
<i>Katharine.</i>

609
01:06:08,168 --> 01:06:10,102
<i>Water.</i>

610
01:06:26,354 --> 01:06:28,652
<i>Geoffrey's not in Cairo.</i>

611
01:06:32,060 --> 01:06:34,893
He's not actually
a buffoon.

612
01:06:34,963 --> 01:06:36,955
The plane wasn't
a wedding present.

613
01:06:37,033 --> 01:06:39,729
It belongs
to the British government.

614
01:06:39,802 --> 01:06:43,169
They want aerial maps
of the whole of North Africa.

615
01:06:43,239 --> 01:06:46,003
So I think
he's in Ethiopia.

616
01:06:48,077 --> 01:06:51,274
In case you're counting
on his sudden appearance.

617
01:06:55,317 --> 01:06:57,945
And the marriage.

618
01:06:58,020 --> 01:07:00,284
Is that a fiction?

619
01:07:02,759 --> 01:07:05,353
No, the marriage
isn't a fiction.

620
01:07:10,367 --> 01:07:12,427
- Oh, thank God.

621
01:07:13,503 --> 01:07:15,528
Thank God.

622
01:07:15,605 --> 01:07:18,665
Madox.
It's Madox.

623
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:26,747
Am I K. in your book?

624
01:07:26,817 --> 01:07:29,082
I think I must be.

625
01:07:51,776 --> 01:07:53,768
<i>Chapter one.</i>

626
01:07:53,846 --> 01:07:58,476
<i>''He sat in defiance of municipal orders</i>
<i>astride the gun Zamzammah</i>--<i>''</i>

627
01:07:58,550 --> 01:08:02,111
<i>I can't read these words. I can't</i>
<i>read them. They stick in my throat.</i>

628
01:08:02,187 --> 01:08:04,587
<i>Because you're</i>
<i>reading it too fast.</i>

629
01:08:04,656 --> 01:08:07,454
- Not at all.
- <i>You have to read Kipling slowly.</i>

630
01:08:07,526 --> 01:08:11,360
<i>Your eye is too impatient.</i>
<i>Think about the speed ofhis pen.</i>

631
01:08:11,430 --> 01:08:14,456
What is it?
''He sat, comma,

632
01:08:14,533 --> 01:08:17,730
<i>''in defiance of</i>
<i>municipal orders, comma,</i>

633
01:08:17,803 --> 01:08:20,773
''astride the gun
Zamzammah...

634
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:24,606
on her brick--''
What is it?

635
01:08:24,677 --> 01:08:27,510
''Brick platform, opposite the old
Ajaib-Gher.''

636
01:08:27,580 --> 01:08:32,415
<i>''The wonder house, comma,</i>

637
01:08:32,485 --> 01:08:36,080
as the natives called
the Lahore Museum.''

638
01:08:36,156 --> 01:08:39,421
<i>It's still there, the cannon,</i>
<i>outside the museum.</i>

639
01:08:39,492 --> 01:08:40,292
Made of metal cups and bowls

640
01:08:40,292 --> 01:08:43,363
taken from every household in
the city as tax,

641
01:08:43,363 --> 01:08:45,628
then melted down.

642
01:08:45,699 --> 01:08:49,760
Then later, they fired
the cannon at my people,

643
01:08:49,837 --> 01:08:53,603
comma,
the natives.

644
01:08:53,674 --> 01:08:55,608
Full stop.

645
01:08:57,678 --> 01:08:59,612
What exactly
is it you object to?

646
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:02,581
The writer,
or what he's writing about?

647
01:09:02,650 --> 01:09:06,518
What I really
object to, Uncle,

648
01:09:06,587 --> 01:09:08,885
is your finishing
all my condensed milk.

649
01:09:08,956 --> 01:09:11,892
And the message everywhere in
your book, however slowly I read it,

650
01:09:11,960 --> 01:09:15,088
that the best thing for India
is to be ruled by the British.

651
01:09:15,163 --> 01:09:18,530
Hana, we have discovered
a shared pleasure, the boy and I.

652
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:21,160
- Arguing about books?
- <i>Condensed milk.</i>

653
01:09:21,236 --> 01:09:23,466
One of the truly
great inventions.

654
01:09:23,538 --> 01:09:26,439
I'll get
another tin.

655
01:09:26,508 --> 01:09:30,137
I didn't like that book either.
It's all about men.

656
01:09:30,212 --> 01:09:33,670
Too many men.
Just like this house.

657
01:09:33,748 --> 01:09:37,185
You like him, don't you?
Your voice changes.

658
01:09:37,253 --> 01:09:39,687
No, I don't
think it does.

659
01:09:39,755 --> 01:09:42,246
Anyway,
he's indifferent to me.

660
01:09:42,325 --> 01:09:45,453
<i>I don't think</i>
<i>it's indifference.</i>

661
01:09:45,528 --> 01:09:48,019
- <i>Hana was just telling me,</i>
<i>you're indifferent...</i>
- Hey!

662
01:09:48,097 --> 01:09:50,190
to her cooking.

663
01:09:51,667 --> 01:09:53,658
Well, I'm indifferent
to cooking.

664
01:09:53,736 --> 01:09:56,534
Not Hana's cooking
in particular.

665
01:09:56,606 --> 01:09:59,871
Have either of you tried
condensed milk sandwiches?

666
01:10:01,945 --> 01:10:04,846
They're very good
with salt.

667
01:10:25,402 --> 01:10:27,667
Welcome back, Madam.

668
01:10:40,351 --> 01:10:42,342
Will you not come in?

669
01:10:42,420 --> 01:10:44,615
No.

670
01:10:44,689 --> 01:10:47,749
- <i>I should go home.</i>
- Will you please come in?

671
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:50,894
Mrs. Clifton.

672
01:10:53,399 --> 01:10:56,027
Don't.

673
01:10:56,101 --> 01:10:58,069
I believe
you still have my book.

674
01:11:14,119 --> 01:11:16,144
Thank you.

675
01:12:40,343 --> 01:12:43,278
You still have
sand in your hair.

676
01:13:06,703 --> 01:13:09,638
It wouldn't be
make-believe

677
01:13:09,706 --> 01:13:13,107
If you believe in me

678
01:13:13,177 --> 01:13:16,669
Without your love

679
01:13:16,747 --> 01:13:19,113
I'm impressed
you can sew.

680
01:13:19,183 --> 01:13:21,117
Good.

681
01:13:28,193 --> 01:13:30,821
You sew very badly.

682
01:13:30,895 --> 01:13:33,227
Well, you don't
sew at all.

683
01:13:33,298 --> 01:13:35,232
A woman should
never learn to sew,

684
01:13:35,300 --> 01:13:37,894
and if she can,
she shouldn't admit to it.

685
01:13:45,677 --> 01:13:48,703
Close your eyes.

686
01:13:48,780 --> 01:13:51,807
It makes it harder still.

687
01:13:54,620 --> 01:13:56,554
Hmm.

688
01:14:00,025 --> 01:14:02,289
When were you
most happy?

689
01:14:02,361 --> 01:14:05,057
Now.

690
01:14:06,432 --> 01:14:08,730
And when were you
least happy?

691
01:14:11,303 --> 01:14:13,294
Now.

692
01:14:18,211 --> 01:14:20,076
- What do you love?
- What do I love?

693
01:14:20,146 --> 01:14:24,173
- Say everything.
- Let's see.

694
01:14:24,251 --> 01:14:26,344
- Water.
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

695
01:14:28,655 --> 01:14:31,351
- Fish in it.

696
01:14:31,424 --> 01:14:34,325
And hedgehogs.
I love hedgehogs.

697
01:14:34,394 --> 01:14:36,328
And what else?

698
01:14:36,396 --> 01:14:39,331
Marmite.
I'm addicted.

699
01:14:41,102 --> 01:14:44,401
And baths.
But not with other people.

700
01:14:49,110 --> 01:14:51,169
Islands.

701
01:14:53,281 --> 01:14:55,715
And your handwriting.

702
01:14:57,685 --> 01:15:00,711
- Mmm.
- I could go on all day.

703
01:15:00,788 --> 01:15:02,779
Go on all day.

704
01:15:10,799 --> 01:15:13,131
My husband.

705
01:15:15,070 --> 01:15:17,504
And what do you
hate most?

706
01:15:21,143 --> 01:15:23,407
A lie.

707
01:15:24,713 --> 01:15:27,910
What do you
hate most?

708
01:15:31,154 --> 01:15:33,748
Ownership.

709
01:15:33,823 --> 01:15:35,916
Being owned.

710
01:15:37,093 --> 01:15:39,857
When you leave,
you should forget me.

711
01:16:09,994 --> 01:16:13,452
-<i>Who is this?</i>
-<i>Don't you recognize me?</i>

712
01:16:13,530 --> 01:16:17,261
Is it you? So fat.

713
01:16:22,374 --> 01:16:24,638
- Hmm.
- <i>That's a Christmas cracker.</i>

714
01:16:24,709 --> 01:16:26,802
<i>Firecracker.</i>

715
01:16:26,878 --> 01:16:29,813
- This isn't your handwriting, is it?
- <i>Yes, it is.</i>

716
01:16:31,383 --> 01:16:34,147
''December 22nd.

717
01:16:34,219 --> 01:16:37,711
''Betrayals in war
are childlike...

718
01:16:37,789 --> 01:16:40,952

01:16:41,026 --> 01:16:45,292

01:16:46,431 --> 01:16:48,696

<i>For the heart</i>

722
01:16:56,509 --> 01:16:59,535
''For the heart
is an organ of fire.''

723
01:17:03,949 --> 01:17:07,214
I love that.

724
01:17:07,286 --> 01:17:09,277
I believe that.

725
01:17:10,589 --> 01:17:12,524
K?

726
01:17:13,894 --> 01:17:16,829
- Who is K?
- <i>K...</i>

727
01:17:18,131 --> 01:17:20,565
is for Katharine.

728
01:17:31,211 --> 01:17:33,304
Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas!

729
01:17:39,287 --> 01:17:42,518
- Say you're sick.
- What? No.

730
01:17:42,590 --> 01:17:45,559
Say you're feeling faint.
The heat.

731
01:17:45,626 --> 01:17:48,493
- No.
- I can't work.

732
01:17:48,563 --> 01:17:52,829
- I can't sleep.
- <i>Katharine.</i>

733
01:17:52,900 --> 01:17:55,061
Coming.

734
01:17:56,604 --> 01:17:59,937
I can't sleep. I wake up shouting
in the middle of the night.

735
01:18:00,007 --> 01:18:04,342
- Geoffrey thinks it's the
thing in the desert, trauma.
- I can still taste you.

736
01:18:07,916 --> 01:18:10,885
- Fill up this. It's empty.
- Oh.

737
01:18:10,953 --> 01:18:14,821
I try to write,
with your taste in my mouth.

738
01:18:18,093 --> 01:18:21,028
Swoon.

739
01:18:21,096 --> 01:18:23,724
They'll catch you.

740
01:18:26,435 --> 01:18:29,701
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!

741
01:18:39,649 --> 01:18:42,880
- Come along with me now!
- Merry Christmas, everyone!

742
01:18:42,952 --> 01:18:44,943
Merry Christmas!

743
01:18:45,021 --> 01:18:47,956
- <i>Katharine! Oh, my goodness!</i>
- Oh.

744
01:18:48,024 --> 01:18:50,049
<i>Fetch a chair.</i>

745
01:18:50,126 --> 01:18:52,094
No, I'm fine.

746
01:18:52,162 --> 01:18:54,427
- It's this heat. It's terrible.
- Is she all right?

747
01:18:54,498 --> 01:18:57,331
- She's quite all right.
- Oh, good.

748
01:18:57,401 --> 01:19:00,165
- Are you pregnant?
- Oh, I don't think so, no.

749
01:19:00,237 --> 01:19:02,228
How romantic.

750
01:19:02,306 --> 01:19:04,638
With Fiona, I fell over
every five minutes.

751
01:19:04,708 --> 01:19:07,802
Ronnie christened me
''Lady Downfall.''

752
01:19:07,878 --> 01:19:12,042
Do you know, I think I might go inside
and sit down for a few minutes.

753
01:19:12,116 --> 01:19:15,210
- I'll come with you.
- No, I'll be all right. You stay here.

754
01:19:15,286 --> 01:19:17,618
Are you sure?

755
01:20:03,402 --> 01:20:07,839
<i>Silent night</i>

756
01:20:07,907 --> 01:20:12,208
<i>Holy night</i>

757
01:20:12,279 --> 01:20:16,181
<i>All is calm</i>

758
01:20:16,250 --> 01:20:20,949
<i>All is bright</i>

759
01:20:21,021 --> 01:20:25,651
<i>Round yon virgin</i>

760
01:20:25,726 --> 01:20:28,661
<i>And her child</i>

761
01:20:41,976 --> 01:20:47,312
Silent night

762
01:20:47,382 --> 01:20:51,375
Holy night

763
01:20:51,452 --> 01:20:56,685
<i>All is calm</i>

764
01:20:56,758 --> 01:21:00,785
<i>All is bright</i>

765
01:21:30,694 --> 01:21:37,896
Sleep in heavenly peace

766
01:21:40,837 --> 01:21:43,431
Happy Christmas!

767
01:21:45,809 --> 01:21:50,269
God save our
gracious king

768
01:21:50,347 --> 01:21:53,044
- Have you seen Katharine?
- What?

769
01:21:53,117 --> 01:21:55,381
- It's Clifton under here.
- <i>Oh.</i>

770
01:21:55,453 --> 01:21:58,320
No, I haven't. Sorry.

771
01:21:59,390 --> 01:22:03,292
<i>Send him victorious</i>

772
01:22:03,361 --> 01:22:06,558
Darling,
I just heard.

773
01:22:08,232 --> 01:22:10,666
You poor sausage.
Are you all right?

774
01:22:10,735 --> 01:22:13,329
I'm fine.
I'm just too hot.

775
01:22:13,404 --> 01:22:15,872
Lady H thought you
might be pregnant.

776
01:22:15,940 --> 01:22:19,934
I'm not pregnant. I'm just hot.
Too hot, like you.

777
01:22:20,012 --> 01:22:22,981
I'm sweltering,
in fact.

778
01:22:25,584 --> 01:22:28,849
Come on,
I'll take you home.

779
01:22:28,920 --> 01:22:33,482
Can we really go home?
I can't breathe.

780
01:22:33,558 --> 01:22:37,426
<i>I am dying for green.</i>
<i>Anything green, or rain.</i>

781
01:22:37,496 --> 01:22:42,628
It's Christmas and it's all--
Oh, I don't know.

782
01:22:47,273 --> 01:22:51,369
If you asked me, I'd go home tomorrow.
If you wanted.

783
01:22:51,444 --> 01:22:55,403
Darling, you know we can't go home.
There might be a war.

784
01:23:00,720 --> 01:23:04,156
Oh, Geoffrey,
you do so love a disguise.

785
01:23:04,223 --> 01:23:06,214
I do so love you.

786
01:23:08,662 --> 01:23:10,596
Mmm.

787
01:23:11,865 --> 01:23:14,800
- What do you smell of?
- What?

788
01:23:16,804 --> 01:23:21,070
Marzipan. I think you've
got marzipan in your hair.

789
01:23:21,141 --> 01:23:23,632
No wonder
you're homesick.

790
01:23:45,333 --> 01:23:47,267
Is it you?

791
01:23:48,336 --> 01:23:49,769
What?

792
01:23:51,072 --> 01:23:53,063
If I said ''Moose''--

793
01:23:53,141 --> 01:23:56,110
Moose?
Who the hell's Moose?

794
01:23:58,948 --> 01:24:01,007
I look different.

795
01:24:01,083 --> 01:24:03,517
Why shouldn't you?

796
01:24:09,592 --> 01:24:11,651
<i>I heard your breathing.</i>

797
01:24:11,727 --> 01:24:15,686
I thought it was the rain.
I'm dying for rain.

798
01:24:15,764 --> 01:24:18,995
Well, I'm dying anyway,
but I--

799
01:24:19,068 --> 01:24:22,401
I long for
the rain on my face.

800
01:24:22,471 --> 01:24:25,498
First wedding anniversary,
what do you call it?

801
01:24:25,575 --> 01:24:29,033
Ha, I don't know.
Paper?

802
01:24:29,112 --> 01:24:32,411
<i>Is it?</i>
<i>I don't know.</i>

803
01:24:32,482 --> 01:24:34,416
Paper.

804
01:24:35,484 --> 01:24:36,850
- Paper?

805
01:24:36,920 --> 01:24:39,081
Darling, it's me.
Listen, I'm sorry, something's come up.

806
01:24:39,156 --> 01:24:41,784
- Oh, no.
- Now don't sulk.
I'll be back tomorrow evening.

807
01:24:41,858 --> 01:24:44,691
I'm going to sulk, and I'm not moving
till you get back here.

808
01:24:44,761 --> 01:24:46,786
Promise?
That's good.

809
01:24:46,863 --> 01:24:49,297
Okay, my sausage,
I love you.

810
01:24:52,303 --> 01:24:55,238
- I didn't know you were going anywhere.
- I'm not.

811
01:24:55,306 --> 01:24:59,709
I'm going to surprise her. It's our
anniversary. She's forgotten, of course.

812
01:24:59,777 --> 01:25:02,177
What's the symbol of your first
anniversary? I should get something.

813
01:25:02,246 --> 01:25:04,214
<i>Is it cotton or paper?</i>

814
01:25:04,282 --> 01:25:07,342
Your first anniversary? I thought you
two'd been married for donkey's years.

815
01:25:07,418 --> 01:25:10,683
We've been friends for donkey's years.
Best friends.

816
01:25:10,755 --> 01:25:13,690
She was always crying on
my shoulder about somebody.

817
01:25:13,758 --> 01:25:17,695
I finally persuaded her to settle
for my shoulder. A stroke of genius.

818
01:25:20,098 --> 01:25:23,158
- Moose, are you there?
- <i>Yes.</i>

819
01:25:23,235 --> 01:25:27,171
- First anniversary. Is that cotton?
- Uh, is what cotton?

820
01:25:27,239 --> 01:25:30,003
First wedding anniversary.

821
01:25:30,075 --> 01:25:32,771
Your first anniversary
is... paper.

822
01:25:45,758 --> 01:25:48,886
- Stop.
- Please?

823
01:25:48,962 --> 01:25:50,953
S-- Stop here.

824
01:25:51,030 --> 01:25:53,294
- Here?
-<i>Just stop right here.</i>

825
01:25:53,366 --> 01:25:55,493
Yes, sir.

826
01:26:31,539 --> 01:26:33,871
This--
What is this?

827
01:26:35,343 --> 01:26:37,777
It's a folk song.

828
01:26:37,846 --> 01:26:40,906
-<i>Arabic.</i>
- No, no, it's Hungarian.

829
01:26:42,884 --> 01:26:45,375
My <i>daijka</i> sang it to me.

830
01:26:45,453 --> 01:26:49,184
When I was a child
growing up in Budapest.

831
01:26:56,197 --> 01:26:58,189
It's beautiful.

832
01:26:58,267 --> 01:27:00,428
Hmm.

833
01:27:00,503 --> 01:27:02,869
What's it about?

834
01:27:02,938 --> 01:27:04,929
<i>Szerelem</i> means love.

835
01:27:05,007 --> 01:27:08,238
And the story--
Well, there's, um,

836
01:27:08,311 --> 01:27:10,871
this Hungarian count.

837
01:27:10,946 --> 01:27:12,937
He's a wanderer.
He's a fool.

838
01:27:13,015 --> 01:27:17,213
<i>And for years he's on</i>
<i>some kind of a quest for...</i>

839
01:27:17,286 --> 01:27:19,720
who knows what.

840
01:27:19,789 --> 01:27:25,592
And then one day, he falls under the
spell of a mysterious English woman,

841
01:27:25,662 --> 01:27:29,393
a harpy, who beats him
and hits him.

842
01:27:29,466 --> 01:27:33,061
And he becomes her slave
and he sews her clothes and worships--

843
01:27:33,136 --> 01:27:35,127
Stop!
Stop it!

844
01:27:35,205 --> 01:27:37,799
Stop! You're always
beating me.

845
01:27:37,874 --> 01:27:39,899
Bastard.

846
01:27:39,976 --> 01:27:42,274
You bastard!
I believed you!

847
01:27:42,346 --> 01:27:45,747
You should be
my slave.

848
01:27:51,356 --> 01:27:56,089
I claim this
shoulder blade--

849
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:59,960
No, wait. No, I want--
Turn over.

850
01:28:00,031 --> 01:28:04,024
I want this, this--
this place.

851
01:28:06,504 --> 01:28:09,166
I love this place.
What's it called?

852
01:28:11,876 --> 01:28:14,744
This is mine.

853
01:28:14,813 --> 01:28:19,147
I'm going to ask the king permission
to call it the Almasy Bosphorus.

854
01:28:22,321 --> 01:28:25,449
I thought we were
against ownership.

855
01:28:34,099 --> 01:28:36,499
I can stay tonight.

856
01:28:42,809 --> 01:28:44,970
Madox knows,
I think.

857
01:28:45,044 --> 01:28:47,706
He keeps talking about
Anna Karenina.

858
01:28:47,781 --> 01:28:51,342
I think it's his idea
of a man-to-man chat.

859
01:28:51,418 --> 01:28:54,148
Well, it's my idea
of a man-to-man chat.

860
01:28:59,826 --> 01:29:03,193
This is a different world,
is what I tell myself.

861
01:29:06,367 --> 01:29:08,801
A different life.

862
01:29:10,538 --> 01:29:14,065
And here
I'm a different wife.

863
01:29:16,744 --> 01:29:19,269
Yes.

864
01:29:19,346 --> 01:29:22,838
Here you are
a different wife.

865
01:29:59,222 --> 01:30:02,157
Oh, they're darling.
What are they? Thimbles?

866
01:30:02,225 --> 01:30:05,319
Yes, and they're
quite old.

867
01:30:05,394 --> 01:30:07,521
It's full of saffron.

868
01:30:07,597 --> 01:30:11,294
Just in case you think
I'm going to give it to you
to encourage your sewing.

869
01:30:19,008 --> 01:30:21,443
I don't care
to bargain.

870
01:30:22,913 --> 01:30:25,575
That day, did you follow me
to the market?

871
01:30:25,649 --> 01:30:27,913
Yes, of course.

872
01:30:34,024 --> 01:30:36,686
Shall we be
all right?

873
01:30:36,760 --> 01:30:38,694
Yes.

874
01:30:39,696 --> 01:30:41,630
Yes.

875
01:30:44,234 --> 01:30:46,226
Absolutely.

876
01:30:46,304 --> 01:30:48,238
Oh, dear.

877
01:30:49,574 --> 01:30:52,873
<i>As dancing</i>
<i>cheek to cheek</i>

878
01:30:52,944 --> 01:30:55,879
<i>Oh, I love to go out fishing</i>

879
01:30:58,850 --> 01:31:02,013
<i>But I don't enjoy it</i>
<i>half as much</i>

880
01:31:02,086 --> 01:31:05,146
<i>As dancing cheek to cheek</i>

881
01:31:05,223 --> 01:31:07,623
<i>Dance with me</i>

882
01:31:07,692 --> 01:31:10,525
-<i>I want my arms about you</i>

883
01:31:10,595 --> 01:31:13,656
<i>The charm about you</i>

884
01:31:13,732 --> 01:31:18,294
<i>Will carry me through</i>
<i>to heaven</i>

885
01:31:18,370 --> 01:31:21,965
<i>I'm in heaven</i>

886
01:31:22,041 --> 01:31:28,344
<i>And my heart beats</i>
<i>so that I can hardly speak</i>

887
01:31:31,317 --> 01:31:34,343
<i>And I seem to find</i>
<i>the happiness I seek</i>

888
01:31:34,386 --> 01:31:39,848
When we're off together
dancing cheek to cheek

889
01:31:41,728 --> 01:31:44,925
- Thought you'd never wake up.
- What?

890
01:31:46,199 --> 01:31:48,895
- Where did you find that?
- I liberated it.

891
01:31:48,969 --> 01:31:53,565
- I think that's called looting.
- No one should own music.

892
01:31:53,640 --> 01:31:55,073
- Who wrote the song?
- Irving Berlin.

893
01:31:55,141 --> 01:31:56,574
- For?
- <i>Top Hat.</i>

894
01:31:56,643 --> 01:31:58,873
Is there a song
you don't know?

895
01:31:58,945 --> 01:32:02,245
<i>Nope.</i>
<i>He sings all the time.</i>

896
01:32:02,316 --> 01:32:06,047
Good morning. Did you know that?
You're always singing.

897
01:32:06,120 --> 01:32:08,987
I've been told before.

898
01:32:09,056 --> 01:32:12,583
Kip's another one.

899
01:32:17,597 --> 01:32:19,225
- ''Wang Wang Blues.''

900
01:32:19,300 --> 01:32:21,063
You're incredible.

901
01:32:29,678 --> 01:32:31,942
- Good mornin', Miss.
- Hello.

902
01:32:32,014 --> 01:32:34,778
<i>You saved my life.</i>

903
01:32:34,850 --> 01:32:38,411
I haven't forgotten.

904
01:32:38,487 --> 01:32:41,251
<i>I thought you were</i>
<i>very, very tall.</i>

905
01:32:41,323 --> 01:32:45,487
You seemed so big
and... giant.

906
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:48,256
I felt like a child
who can't keep her balance.

907
01:32:48,330 --> 01:32:52,130
- A toddler.
- A toddler.

908
01:33:15,892 --> 01:33:18,327
My hair was long
at some point.

909
01:33:21,598 --> 01:33:25,864
I've forgotten what
a nuisance it is to wash.

910
01:33:28,172 --> 01:33:31,300
Try this. I found
a great jar of it.

911
01:33:31,375 --> 01:33:33,309
Olive oil.

912
01:33:33,377 --> 01:33:35,311
Thank you.

913
01:33:43,855 --> 01:33:46,688
Is this for my hair?

914
01:33:46,758 --> 01:33:49,852
Yes, for your hair.

915
01:33:57,936 --> 01:34:00,632
There was a general
who wore a patch...

916
01:34:00,705 --> 01:34:03,572
over a perfectly
good eye.

917
01:34:03,641 --> 01:34:06,769
<i>The men fought</i>
<i>harder for him.</i>

918
01:34:12,485 --> 01:34:15,886
Sometimes I think
I could get up and dance.

919
01:34:17,022 --> 01:34:19,183
What's under
your mittens?

920
01:34:25,297 --> 01:34:27,322
What's under
your mittens?

921
01:34:49,422 --> 01:34:51,856
He's waiting for you.

922
01:34:51,925 --> 01:34:53,415
I'll see you
tonight?

923
01:34:56,363 --> 01:34:58,661
Look, Moose, we need you
to stay in Tobruk.

924
01:34:58,732 --> 01:35:02,760
I know it's a bit of a short straw,
butJerry's got our maps, you know.

925
01:35:02,837 --> 01:35:05,704
And now they're getting
their spies into Cairo using our maps.

926
01:35:05,773 --> 01:35:08,435
They'll get Rommel into Cairo
using our maps.

927
01:35:08,509 --> 01:35:10,502
The whole of the desert's like a
bloody bus route

928
01:35:10,502 --> 01:35:12,104
and we gave it to 'em!

929
01:35:12,180 --> 01:35:14,114
Any foreigner

930
01:35:14,182 --> 01:35:16,742
''Welcome to the Royal Geographic.
Take our maps.''

931
01:35:16,818 --> 01:35:18,752
Old Madox went mad,
you know.

932
01:35:18,820 --> 01:35:20,879
- Did you know Peter Madox?
- Yeah.

933
01:35:20,955 --> 01:35:23,549
Magnificent explorer.
Thanks, Aicha.

934
01:35:23,624 --> 01:35:26,287
And after he found out
he'd been betrayed by Almasy.

935
01:35:26,361 --> 01:35:28,625
His best friend.

936
01:35:28,697 --> 01:35:31,427
Absolutely destroyed
the poor sot.

937
01:35:51,154 --> 01:35:53,418
<i>Hey, Commandant,</i>
<i>stay in line!</i>

938
01:36:06,069 --> 01:36:08,435
-<i>Jah.</i>

939
01:36:11,541 --> 01:36:15,500
Hello, little Tommy.
Little baby, hello.

940
01:36:16,881 --> 01:36:19,179
- <i>Recognize him? British friend?</i>
- No.

941
01:36:19,250 --> 01:36:22,242
Aaah!

942
01:36:24,688 --> 01:36:27,316
- Get up!
- No!

943
01:36:27,391 --> 01:36:29,325
<i>Get up at once!</i>

944
01:36:29,393 --> 01:36:32,328
<i>No, I don't have a boyfriend.</i>

945
01:36:32,396 --> 01:36:34,956
<i>I don't know anybody!</i>

946
01:36:35,032 --> 01:36:37,523
Halt!

947
01:36:37,601 --> 01:36:41,538
<i>No! No!</i>

948
01:36:50,649 --> 01:36:53,243
<i>David Caravaggio.</i>

949
01:36:53,318 --> 01:36:57,015
- No.
- <i>This was taken in Cairo</i>
<i>at British headquarters.</i>

950
01:36:57,088 --> 01:36:59,818
July '41 .

951
01:36:59,891 --> 01:37:02,018
And so was this.

952
01:37:02,093 --> 01:37:05,494
August '41 .
And this.

953
01:37:05,563 --> 01:37:07,532
February '42.

954
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:10,364
It's possible.

955
01:37:10,436 --> 01:37:13,735
I was buying or selling something.
I've been to Cairo many times.

956
01:37:13,806 --> 01:37:17,708
You are a Canadian spy
working for the Allies.

957
01:37:17,777 --> 01:37:19,171
Moose.

958
01:37:28,020 --> 01:37:30,250
<i>Jah?</i>

959
01:37:30,323 --> 01:37:33,259
Can you get me a doctor?
I'm sick.

960
01:37:33,327 --> 01:37:36,763
<i>I'm leaking blood!</i>

961
01:37:36,830 --> 01:37:38,798
You want a doctor?

962
01:37:38,865 --> 01:37:40,958
I've been askin'
for weeks, months--

963
01:37:41,034 --> 01:37:43,127
We don't have a doctor.

964
01:37:43,203 --> 01:37:45,569
But we do have a nurse.

965
01:37:45,639 --> 01:37:47,903
Sure, great.
A nurse would be great.

966
01:37:50,043 --> 01:37:54,275
Look, give me something.
A name, a code.

967
01:37:54,348 --> 01:37:57,044
So we can all
get out of this room.

968
01:37:58,586 --> 01:38:00,952
I can't think
in this heat.

969
01:38:01,022 --> 01:38:04,617
- It's too hot.
- I slept with a girl.

970
01:38:06,327 --> 01:38:08,955
I've got a wife
in Tripoli.

971
01:38:09,030 --> 01:38:13,524
<i>A girl comes up and points</i>
<i>at you,you only see trouble.</i>

972
01:38:13,601 --> 01:38:14,798
-<i>Fire!</i>

973
01:38:18,306 --> 01:38:20,570
<i>I'll tell you what</i>
<i>I'm going to do.</i>

974
01:38:20,641 --> 01:38:23,304
This is your nurse,
by the way.

975
01:38:23,379 --> 01:38:26,177
She's Muslim, so she'll understand
all of this.

976
01:38:26,248 --> 01:38:30,207
What's the punishment for adultery?
Let's leave it at that.

977
01:38:30,285 --> 01:38:33,743
You're married and you were

978
01:38:33,743 --> 01:38:35,290
fucking another woman,
so that's, uh--

979
01:38:35,290 --> 01:38:38,191
Is it the hands that are cut off?

980
01:38:38,260 --> 01:38:41,195
Or is that for stealing?
Does anyone know?

981
01:38:41,263 --> 01:38:44,460
Well, you must know.
You were brought up in Libya, yes?

982
01:38:44,533 --> 01:38:47,001
- Don't cut me.
- Or was it Toronto?

983
01:38:48,570 --> 01:38:50,005
- Ten fingers.

984
01:38:50,073 --> 01:38:52,007
How about this?

985
01:38:52,075 --> 01:38:54,805
You give me a name for every finger.
It doesn't matter who.

986
01:38:54,878 --> 01:38:57,847
<i>I get something,</i>
<i>you keep something.</i>

987
01:38:57,914 --> 01:39:00,212
- <i>I'm trying to be reasonable.</i>
- Don't cut me. Come on!

988
01:39:04,554 --> 01:39:06,613
Are thumbs fingers?

989
01:39:14,732 --> 01:39:17,462
- I get no help from these people.
- Telephone.

990
01:39:17,535 --> 01:39:21,631
<i>I'm sick of this room, I'm sick of</i>
<i>this heat and I'm sick of this phone!</i>

991
01:39:29,146 --> 01:39:31,011
-<i>Ah! The Geneva Convention!</i>

992
01:39:31,082 --> 01:39:34,415
Hey, come on!
You can't do that!

993
01:39:34,485 --> 01:39:36,976
- Come over here.
- I'll give you names.

994
01:39:37,054 --> 01:39:40,218
- <i>You!</i>
- <i>I'll give you names!</i>

995
01:39:40,292 --> 01:39:42,317
- Come on!
- What names did you say?

996
01:39:42,394 --> 01:39:46,888
<i>Aaah! Aaah! Let me think!</i>
<i>Just let me think!</i>

997
01:39:46,965 --> 01:39:50,196
<i>I can't think! I know them!</i>
<i>Please, let me think!</i>

998
01:39:50,268 --> 01:39:52,532
I promise!
Oh, please, please, no!

999
01:39:52,604 --> 01:39:55,732
- What name did you say? I knew them!
- Come on!

1000
01:39:55,807 --> 01:39:59,072
- I can't think of any names!
Not my hands! Oh, dear God!
- <i>What are you waiting for?</i>

1001
01:39:59,144 --> 01:40:02,204
Jesus Christ!
Jesus Christ, no!

1002
01:40:02,280 --> 01:40:04,841
I promise!
Oh, please, not my hands!

1003
01:40:04,917 --> 01:40:09,013
<i>No!Jesus!</i>
<i>Jesus! Oh, dear God!</i>

1004
01:40:09,088 --> 01:40:10,953
- <i>Please don't cut me!</i>
- Come on!

1005
01:40:11,023 --> 01:40:13,617
Aaah!
No!

1006
01:40:13,693 --> 01:40:15,854
<i>Please don't cut!</i>

1007
01:40:15,928 --> 01:40:20,831
<i>Don't!</i>

1008
01:40:20,900 --> 01:40:24,495
<i>The man who took my thumbs?</i>

1009
01:40:24,570 --> 01:40:28,563
<i>I found him eventually.</i>
<i>I killed him.</i>

1010
01:40:28,641 --> 01:40:31,236
The man who took my photograph?
I found him too.

1011
01:40:31,311 --> 01:40:35,509
That took me a year.
He's dead.

1012
01:40:35,582 --> 01:40:37,846
Another man
showed the Germans...

1013
01:40:37,918 --> 01:40:40,716
a way to get
their spies into Cairo.

1014
01:40:40,787 --> 01:40:44,052
I've been
looking for him.

1015
01:40:44,124 --> 01:40:46,888
<i>You can't get through there.</i>
<i>It's impossible.</i>

1016
01:40:46,960 --> 01:40:49,360
<i>I was looking again</i>
<i>at Bell's old maps.</i>

1017
01:40:49,429 --> 01:40:51,556
<i>If we can find a way</i>
<i>through the Wadi,</i>

1018
01:40:51,632 --> 01:40:54,430
<i>we can drive</i>
<i>straight into Cairo.</i>

1019
01:40:54,501 --> 01:40:57,300
- This whole spur is a real possibility.
-<i>So on Thursday,</i>

1020
01:40:57,372 --> 01:41:00,068
you don't trust Bell's map, Bell was
a fool, Bell couldn't draw a map.

1021
01:41:00,141 --> 01:41:02,974
But on Friday,
he's suddenly infallible.

1022
01:41:03,044 --> 01:41:05,945
- And where are the expedition maps?
- In my room.

1023
01:41:06,014 --> 01:41:08,448
Those maps belong to
His Majesty's Government.

1024
01:41:08,516 --> 01:41:09,549
They shouldn't be left lying around for

1025
01:41:09,549 --> 01:41:11,349
any Tom, Dick or Harry
to have sight of.

1026
01:41:11,419 --> 01:41:14,013
What on earth's
the matter with you?

1027
01:41:14,088 --> 01:41:17,319
Don't be so bloody naive!
You know there's a war breaking out!

1028
01:41:24,433 --> 01:41:26,628
This arrived this morning.

1029
01:41:26,702 --> 01:41:28,966
''By order of
the British Government,

1030
01:41:29,038 --> 01:41:33,407
all international expeditions
to be aborted by May, 1 939.''

1031
01:41:36,845 --> 01:41:40,337
What do they care
about our maps?

1032
01:41:40,416 --> 01:41:42,884
What do we find
in the desert?

1033
01:41:42,952 --> 01:41:45,546
Arrowheads,
spears.

1034
01:41:45,621 --> 01:41:48,557
In a war, if you own the desert,
you own North Africa.

1035
01:41:48,625 --> 01:41:51,287
Own the desert?
Ha!

1036
01:41:52,362 --> 01:41:56,059
Um, Madox?
That place--

1037
01:41:58,501 --> 01:42:01,664
That place at the base
of a woman's throat.

1038
01:42:03,273 --> 01:42:06,800
<i>You know,</i>
<i>the hollow here.</i>

1039
01:42:06,876 --> 01:42:09,174
Does it have
an official name?

1040
01:42:11,248 --> 01:42:14,980
For God's sake, man,
pull yourself together.

1041
01:42:25,496 --> 01:42:28,431
<i>Nowhere is there any</i>
<i>wild patriotic excitement,</i>

1042
01:42:28,499 --> 01:42:30,558
<i>but everywhere there is</i>
<i>a deep hatred of war.</i>

1043
01:42:30,635 --> 01:42:33,297
<i>The answer lies</i>
<i>with one man,</i>

1044
01:42:33,371 --> 01:42:36,933
<i>and the solid mass of the crowd</i>
<i>surging round his car...</i>

1045
01:42:37,009 --> 01:42:40,706
<i>are a symbol that the British people are</i>
<i>more firmly of one mind today...</i>

1046
01:42:40,779 --> 01:42:44,010
<i>than at any other time</i>
<i>in our history.</i>

1047
01:42:49,154 --> 01:42:52,214
<i>There's a great to-do</i>
<i>in Sandown Bay,</i>

1048
01:42:52,291 --> 01:42:56,125
<i>with rowing and sailing, and no</i>
<i>end of sport for every water baby.</i>

1049
01:42:58,964 --> 01:43:01,728
Sorry.

1050
01:43:04,637 --> 01:43:07,367
I can't--
I can't do this.

1051
01:43:10,743 --> 01:43:14,179
I can't do this.
I can't do this anymore.

1052
01:43:42,810 --> 01:43:45,074
I'd better go now.

1053
01:43:47,514 --> 01:43:49,948
Say goodbye here.

1054
01:43:50,017 --> 01:43:53,715
I'm not agreeing. Don't think
I'm agreeing, because I'm not.

1055
01:43:53,788 --> 01:43:55,813
Any minute now,
he'll find out.

1056
01:43:55,890 --> 01:43:57,881
We'll barge into someone.
It'll kill him.

1057
01:43:57,959 --> 01:44:00,052
Don't go over it again,
please.

1058
01:44:10,939 --> 01:44:13,635
Katharine?

1059
01:44:17,579 --> 01:44:19,810
I--

1060
01:44:19,882 --> 01:44:22,976
I just want you
to know I'm--

1061
01:44:23,052 --> 01:44:25,714
I'm not missing you yet.

1062
01:44:28,057 --> 01:44:31,959
You will.
You will.

1063
01:45:03,827 --> 01:45:07,263
I believe I'm rather late.

1064
01:45:08,632 --> 01:45:11,158
Good.
We're all here.

1065
01:45:11,235 --> 01:45:15,365
<i>A toast to the</i>
<i>International Sand Club.</i>

1066
01:45:15,440 --> 01:45:17,840
May it soon resurface.

1067
01:45:17,909 --> 01:45:19,809
The International Sand Club.

1068
01:45:19,877 --> 01:45:24,905
misfits, buggers, fascists and fools.

1069
01:45:24,982 --> 01:45:27,576
God bless us, every one.
Oops!

1070
01:45:27,652 --> 01:45:31,247
Mustn't say ''International.''
Dirty word, filthy word.

1071
01:45:31,322 --> 01:45:34,587
<i>His Majesty, die Fuhrer,</i>
<i>il duce</i>--

1072
01:45:34,659 --> 01:45:36,127
Sorry.
What's your point?

1073
01:45:36,195 --> 01:45:39,221
And the people here don't want us.
You must be joking.

1074
01:45:39,298 --> 01:45:43,257
Egyptians are desperate to get rid of
the colonials. Isn't that right, Fouad?

1075
01:45:43,335 --> 01:45:46,634
<i>Some of their best people</i>
<i>getting down on their hands and knees,</i>

1076
01:45:46,705 --> 01:45:49,196
begging to be spared
the Knighthood.

1077
01:45:49,274 --> 01:45:52,732
Isn't that right? Hmm?
Isn't that right, Sir Ronnie?

1078
01:45:52,811 --> 01:45:56,645
What's my point?
Oh, I've invented a new dance.

1079
01:45:56,715 --> 01:45:58,808
<i>Anybody up for it?</i>
<i>It's called</i>--

1080
01:45:58,884 --> 01:46:01,445
It's called
the Bosphorus Hug.

1081
01:46:01,521 --> 01:46:03,216
Madox?

1082
01:46:03,289 --> 01:46:07,749
<i>Bermann?</i>
<i>You'll dance with me? Hmm?</i>

1083
01:46:07,827 --> 01:46:10,762
D'Ag.
Come on, Daggers.

1084
01:46:10,830 --> 01:46:13,321
<i>Let's eat first.</i>
<i>Sit down.</i>

1085
01:46:16,169 --> 01:46:19,570
<i>We'll bathe at Brighton</i>
<i>The fish you'll frighten</i>

1086
01:46:19,639 --> 01:46:22,403
<i>When you're in</i>
<i>your bathing suit so thin</i>

1087
01:46:22,475 --> 01:46:25,069
We'll make the shellfish grin
Fin to fin

1088
01:46:25,144 --> 01:46:28,137
<i>They're playing it far too slowly,</i>
<i>but these were the words,</i>

1089
01:46:28,215 --> 01:46:31,981
actually, before
they were cleaned up.

1090
01:46:32,052 --> 01:46:35,146
Might be a song for you,
Mrs. Clif--

1091
01:46:35,222 --> 01:46:37,656
<i>You either shut up</i>
<i>or go home! You're completely blasted!</i>

1092
01:46:37,725 --> 01:46:40,523
- Sit down!
- Absolutely right! Shut up! Shut up!

1093
01:46:40,594 --> 01:46:45,031
<i>Sorry. Sorry.</i>
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

1094
01:46:45,099 --> 01:46:47,795
I can't think
what came over me.

1095
01:46:47,868 --> 01:46:50,860
Lashings of apologies...

1096
01:46:50,938 --> 01:46:53,134
all around.

1097
01:47:25,708 --> 01:47:27,175
Thank you.

1098
01:47:37,219 --> 01:47:40,484
- Why were you holding his collar?
- What?

1099
01:47:40,556 --> 01:47:43,993
''What''? That boy.
That little boy.

1100
01:47:44,061 --> 01:47:47,224
You were holding his collar.
You were gripping his collar. What for?

1101
01:47:47,297 --> 01:47:49,765
Hmm?
Is he next?

1102
01:47:49,833 --> 01:47:52,495
Are you going to drag him
into your little room? Where is it?

1103
01:47:52,569 --> 01:47:54,469
Is this it?

1104
01:47:54,538 --> 01:47:56,802
- Don't do this.
- I've watched you.

1105
01:47:56,873 --> 01:47:59,239
I've watched you
at garden parties,

1106
01:47:59,309 --> 01:48:01,573
on verandas,
at the races.

1107
01:48:01,645 --> 01:48:05,604
- How can you... stand there?
- Please.

1108
01:48:05,682 --> 01:48:08,550
How can you
ever smile,

1109
01:48:08,620 --> 01:48:12,647
as if your life
hadn't capsized?

1110
01:48:14,325 --> 01:48:16,793
You know why?

1111
01:48:19,397 --> 01:48:21,388
Dance with me.

1112
01:48:22,467 --> 01:48:24,867
No.

1113
01:48:24,936 --> 01:48:27,905
Dance with me.

1114
01:48:27,972 --> 01:48:30,907
I want to touch you.

1115
01:48:30,975 --> 01:48:34,912
I want the things which are mine,
which belong to me.

1116
01:48:38,283 --> 01:48:41,775
Do you think you're the
only one who feels anything?

1117
01:48:41,854 --> 01:48:44,823
Is that what
you think?

1118
01:49:03,643 --> 01:49:06,669
Why don't you go?

1119
01:49:06,746 --> 01:49:10,409
- Get some sleep.
- Would you like me to?

1120
01:49:17,290 --> 01:49:20,123
Good night.

1121
01:50:24,694 --> 01:50:26,628
<i>Hana.</i>

1122
01:50:31,701 --> 01:50:33,999
Kip.

1123
01:51:07,884 --> 01:51:11,115
Just wait.
Don't look at anything yet.

1124
01:51:33,844 --> 01:51:35,903
Wait.

1125
01:51:52,229 --> 01:51:54,322
Kip!

1126
01:53:15,049 --> 01:53:17,381
Oh, thank you!

1127
01:53:18,386 --> 01:53:20,513
Mmm!

1128
01:53:34,168 --> 01:53:38,128
If one night I didn't come
to see you,

1129
01:53:39,641 --> 01:53:42,201
what would you do?

1130
01:53:42,277 --> 01:53:45,110
I try not
to expect you.

1131
01:53:47,983 --> 01:53:52,044
Yes, but if it
got late and...

1132
01:53:52,120 --> 01:53:54,748
I hadn't shown up?

1133
01:53:56,191 --> 01:53:59,558
Then I'd think
there must be a reason.

1134
01:54:00,629 --> 01:54:03,064
You wouldn't come
to find me?

1135
01:54:05,401 --> 01:54:08,962
Hmm. That makes me
never want to come here.

1136
01:54:13,843 --> 01:54:16,107
Then I'd tell myself,

1137
01:54:16,179 --> 01:54:19,444
he spends all day
searching.

1138
01:54:19,515 --> 01:54:22,450
In the night,
he wants to be found.

1139
01:54:27,857 --> 01:54:30,793
I do. I do want you
to find me.

1140
01:54:31,862 --> 01:54:34,296
<i>I do want</i>
<i>to be found.</i>

1141
01:54:51,815 --> 01:54:54,410
I was looking for
Lieutenant Singh.

1142
01:54:54,486 --> 01:54:58,547
- He's sleeping.
- Only we've got to go to work.

1143
01:54:58,623 --> 01:55:01,091
I'll tell him.

1144
01:55:02,293 --> 01:55:04,887
What is it?
Is it a mine?

1145
01:55:04,963 --> 01:55:07,693
It's a bomb
by a viaduct.

1146
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,662
- Does he have to go?
- Beg pardon?

1147
01:55:11,736 --> 01:55:15,672
What if you couldn't find him?
Sergeant, not today. Not this morning.

1148
01:55:15,740 --> 01:55:19,677
- What's happening? Am I needed?
- Afraid so, sir.

1149
01:55:20,746 --> 01:55:23,840
<i>Don't go.</i>
<i>I'm frightened.</i>

1150
01:55:23,916 --> 01:55:26,885
This is what I do.

1151
01:55:26,952 --> 01:55:29,944
I do this
every day.

1152
01:55:48,942 --> 01:55:50,933
Hardy!

1153
01:55:51,011 --> 01:55:54,174
Serial number
K-K-I-P...

1154
01:55:54,247 --> 01:55:57,045
2-6-0-0.

1155
01:55:57,117 --> 01:56:00,109
<i>K-K-I-P2600, sir!</i>

1156
01:56:00,187 --> 01:56:02,678
I'll get the oxygen.

1157
01:56:59,014 --> 01:57:02,007
<i>Hardy, what's happening?</i>

1158
01:57:02,085 --> 01:57:05,054
<i>Can't see, sir!</i>
<i>It's from the road!</i>

1159
01:57:06,589 --> 01:57:09,888
Corporal?

1160
01:57:09,959 --> 01:57:13,360
Tanks, sir!
I don't know what it's about!

1161
01:57:13,429 --> 01:57:16,364
- Stop 'em!
- Stop!

1162
01:57:17,432 --> 01:57:18,798
- Stop!

1163
01:57:18,868 --> 01:57:22,269
- Hardy!
- Stop! Stop!

1164
01:57:22,338 --> 01:57:24,431
What is this,
a bloody carnival?

1165
01:57:24,507 --> 01:57:26,533
The fuse has snapped!

1166
01:57:26,610 --> 01:57:30,444
<i>What's happened? Is it armed?</i>

1167
01:57:32,114 --> 01:57:33,881
- Hang on a second.

1168
01:57:33,951 --> 01:57:35,816
<i>I'll be right with you.</i>

1169
01:57:35,886 --> 01:57:39,253
<i>Can you see</i>
<i>the detonator, sir?</i>

1170
01:57:39,323 --> 01:57:42,156
You've got to cut it, sir.
That frost won't last.

1171
01:57:43,527 --> 01:57:46,496
Stop! Stop!
Slow down!

1172
01:57:50,701 --> 01:57:54,103
Stop! Stop!
Slow down!

1173
01:57:54,172 --> 01:57:56,936
- Go away!
- Yes, sir.

1174
01:57:57,008 --> 01:58:00,774
- This is making me incredibly angry.
- I know, sir.

1175
01:58:01,846 --> 01:58:03,905
<i>Watch out!</i>
<i>That'll burn!</i>

1176
01:58:03,982 --> 01:58:05,813
Ow!

1177
01:58:10,722 --> 01:58:13,122
<i>Can you feel 'em?</i>

1178
01:58:23,069 --> 01:58:25,537
Cut it, sir.

1179
01:58:25,605 --> 01:58:28,096
- <i>You've gotta cut it!</i>
- I don't even know if
this is the right wire.

1180
01:58:28,174 --> 01:58:31,769
<i>Choose.Just choose a loop</i>
<i>and cut it.</i>

1181
01:58:54,034 --> 01:58:57,561
Get a blanket! Spaulding, get a
blanket for Lieutenant!

1182
01:58:57,638 --> 01:59:01,165
Sarge! Sarge!
It's over, sir! It's over!

1183
01:59:01,241 --> 01:59:04,233
-Jerry's surrendered!
- Yeah-ha!

1184
01:59:09,250 --> 01:59:11,184
Sir, congratulations.

1185
01:59:13,021 --> 01:59:18,152
<i>Heaven</i>
<i>I'm in heaven</i>

1186
01:59:18,226 --> 01:59:20,956
Kip? Kip?

1187
01:59:21,029 --> 01:59:22,963
Kip!

1188
01:59:23,031 --> 01:59:26,831
<i>And my heart beats</i>
<i>so that I can hardly speak</i>

1189
01:59:26,901 --> 01:59:32,032
<i>And I seem to find</i>
<i>the happiness I seek</i>

1190
01:59:32,106 --> 01:59:34,405
Hey, we're goin' home!

1191
01:59:34,476 --> 01:59:39,470
<i>When we're out together</i>
<i>dancing cheek to cheek</i>

1192
01:59:42,215 --> 01:59:44,047
- It's raining.

1193
01:59:48,357 --> 01:59:52,123
<i>And the cares that hung</i>
<i>around me through the week</i>

1194
01:59:54,897 --> 02:00:02,600
<i>Seem to vanish like</i>
<i>a gambler's lucky streak</i>

1195
02:00:02,672 --> 02:00:06,904
<i>When we're out together</i>
<i>dancing cheek to cheek</i>

1196
02:00:09,713 --> 02:00:13,205
<i>Oh, I love to</i>
<i>climb a mountain</i>

1197
02:00:13,283 --> 02:00:16,719
<i>And to reach</i>
<i>the highest peak</i>

1198
02:00:16,786 --> 02:00:20,552
<i>But it doesn't thrill me</i>
<i>half as much</i>

1199
02:00:20,623 --> 02:00:24,115
-<i>As dancing cheek to cheek</i>

1200
02:00:28,032 --> 02:00:30,500
Kip, come and
dance with us.

1201
02:00:30,568 --> 02:00:32,798
- Later.
- <i>Oh, come on.</i>

1202
02:00:35,639 --> 02:00:39,473
Clap now.

1203
02:00:39,543 --> 02:00:41,738
Yeah.

1204
02:00:57,929 --> 02:01:00,989
<i>Come on, Sarge!</i>
<i>Let's raise that flag!</i>

1205
02:01:01,066 --> 02:01:03,432
Hardy's coming!

1206
02:01:04,569 --> 02:01:07,003
Here comes the bomb squad!

1207
02:01:13,578 --> 02:01:15,706
Hey, where's my helmet?

1208
02:01:15,782 --> 02:01:18,842
Go on,
Sergeant Hardy!

1209
02:01:27,560 --> 02:01:30,358
Bring 'em home!

1210
02:01:30,429 --> 02:01:33,159
Hardy! Hardy! Hardy!

1211
02:01:38,304 --> 02:01:42,173
What was that?

1212
02:01:45,145 --> 02:01:47,579
<i>I'm never going</i>
<i>to forgive myself.</i>

1213
02:01:47,648 --> 02:01:50,173
<i>I'm never going</i>
<i>to bloody forgive myself.</i>

1214
02:01:53,520 --> 02:01:56,751
Sergeant Hardy, sir.
It was booby-trapped.

1215
02:01:56,824 --> 02:02:00,555
They was runnin' up the Union Jack, sir,
up on that statue.

1216
02:02:00,627 --> 02:02:02,227
- It just went off, sir.

1217
02:02:03,931 --> 02:02:07,333
Sergeant Hardy climbed up,
Sir,just for a lark, sir.

1218
02:02:07,402 --> 02:02:09,461
It should've been me.
It was my idea.

1219
02:02:09,537 --> 02:02:12,768
- Sir, you don't wanna look.
- Ooh.

1220
02:02:12,841 --> 02:02:14,866
Who's that girl?

1221
02:02:14,943 --> 02:02:17,741
His fiancee, sir.

1222
02:02:17,812 --> 02:02:22,010
- Hardy's?
- He kept it a bit dark.

1223
02:02:30,124 --> 02:02:32,059
Kip?

1224
02:02:33,128 --> 02:02:35,426
Kip, it's me.

1225
02:02:36,632 --> 02:02:39,567
<i>I'm so sorry about</i>
<i>what happened.</i>

1226
02:02:40,903 --> 02:02:44,031
<i>Can I talk to you?</i>
<i>Kip?</i>

1227
02:02:45,808 --> 02:02:48,743
Kip, why won't
you talk to me?

1228
02:02:51,947 --> 02:02:54,211
Oh, Kip.

1229
02:02:58,221 --> 02:03:00,655
Oh, let me come in!

1230
02:03:26,984 --> 02:03:30,317
<i>Hana tells me you're leaving.</i>

1231
02:03:30,388 --> 02:03:32,822
<i>There's going to be trials.</i>

1232
02:03:32,890 --> 02:03:35,154
<i>They want me to interpret.</i>

1233
02:03:35,226 --> 02:03:38,093
<i>Don't they know</i>
<i>I'm allergic to courtrooms?</i>

1234
02:03:42,600 --> 02:03:44,534
So...

1235
02:03:46,337 --> 02:03:48,602
I come across
the hospital convoy.

1236
02:03:48,674 --> 02:03:51,666
<i>They're looking</i>
<i>for this stuff.</i>

1237
02:03:51,743 --> 02:03:54,109
<i>This nurse, Mary,</i>

1238
02:03:54,179 --> 02:03:56,613
<i>tells me about</i>
<i>you and Hana...</i>

1239
02:03:56,682 --> 02:03:59,116
<i>hiding in some</i>
<i>monastery in</i>--

1240
02:03:59,184 --> 02:04:02,415
What do you call it?
Retreat?

1241
02:04:02,487 --> 02:04:04,887
How you came
out of the desert...

1242
02:04:04,957 --> 02:04:09,223
and you were burned
and you didn't remember your name,

1243
02:04:09,294 --> 02:04:11,888
but you knew the words
to every song that ever was...

1244
02:04:11,964 --> 02:04:15,867
a copy of Herodotus.

1245
02:04:15,935 --> 02:04:18,495
And it was filled...

1246
02:04:18,571 --> 02:04:20,835
with letters and cuttings.

1247
02:04:22,041 --> 02:04:24,475
Then I knew it was you.

1248
02:04:27,113 --> 02:04:29,707
Me?

1249
02:04:40,227 --> 02:04:42,161
I saw you...

1250
02:04:42,229 --> 02:04:47,189
<i>writing in that book</i>
<i>at the embassy in Cairo...</i>

1251
02:04:48,802 --> 02:04:52,761
when I had thumbs
and you had a face...

1252
02:04:52,840 --> 02:04:54,831
and a name.

1253
02:04:54,908 --> 02:04:56,842
<i>I see.</i>

1254
02:04:58,245 --> 02:05:00,543
Before you went
over to the Germans,

1255
02:05:00,614 --> 02:05:04,148
<i>before you found a way to get</i>
<i>Rommel's spy across the desert</i>

1256
02:05:04,148 --> 02:05:05,348
<i>and inside British headquarters.</i>

1257
02:05:05,420 --> 02:05:07,718
He took some
pretty good photographs.

1258
02:05:07,789 --> 02:05:11,190
I saw mine in that
torture room in Tobruk.

1259
02:05:11,259 --> 02:05:15,593
So, it made an impression.

1260
02:05:15,663 --> 02:05:20,100
I had to get back to the desert.
I'd made a promise.

1261
02:05:20,168 --> 02:05:22,261
The rest meant
nothing to me.

1262
02:05:22,337 --> 02:05:24,828
What did you say?

1263
02:05:24,906 --> 02:05:28,398
That the rest...
meant nothing to me.

1264
02:05:28,476 --> 02:05:31,037
There was a result
to what you did.

1265
02:05:31,113 --> 02:05:34,640
It wasn't just another expedition.
It did this.

1266
02:05:34,717 --> 02:05:37,686
<i>If the British hadn't</i>
<i>unearthed that photographer,</i>

1267
02:05:37,753 --> 02:05:39,846
<i>thousands of people</i>
<i>could have died.</i>

1268
02:05:39,922 --> 02:05:43,483
Thousands of people <i>did</i> die.
Just different people.

1269
02:05:43,559 --> 02:05:47,723
- Yes, like Madox.
- What?

1270
02:05:47,797 --> 02:05:50,595
You know he shot himself,
your partner,

1271
02:05:50,666 --> 02:05:53,260
- <i>when he found out you were a spy.</i>
- What?

1272
02:05:55,539 --> 02:06:00,135
Madox thought
I was a spy? No.

1273
02:06:00,210 --> 02:06:03,407
<i>No, I was never a spy.</i>

1274
02:06:03,480 --> 02:06:06,040
It's ghastly.
It's like a witch hunt.

1275
02:06:06,116 --> 02:06:08,550
Anybody remotely foreign
is suddenly a spy.

1276
02:06:08,618 --> 02:06:11,109
- So watch out.
- Right.

1277
02:06:11,188 --> 02:06:14,521
We didn't care about
countries, did we?

1278
02:06:14,591 --> 02:06:17,424
Brits, Arabs,
Hungarians, Germans--

1279
02:06:17,494 --> 02:06:19,758
None of that mattered, did it?
It was something finer than that.

1280
02:06:19,830 --> 02:06:22,698
Yes, it was.

1281
02:06:24,168 --> 02:06:27,262
I'll leave the plane
in Kufra oasis.

1282
02:06:27,338 --> 02:06:29,806
-<i>So, if you need it</i>--
- Right.

1283
02:06:29,874 --> 02:06:32,570
<i>Hard to know</i>
<i>how long one's talking about.</i>

1284
02:06:32,643 --> 02:06:36,374
We might all be back
in a month or two.

1285
02:06:39,684 --> 02:06:41,652
Hmm.

1286
02:06:45,357 --> 02:06:49,953
I have to teach myself not to
read too much into everything.

1287
02:06:50,028 --> 02:06:53,555
It comes of too long having to read
so much into hardly anything at all.

1288
02:06:59,104 --> 02:07:02,335
Good-bye, my friend.

1289
02:07:07,813 --> 02:07:09,872
There is no God.

1290
02:07:09,948 --> 02:07:13,248
But I hope someone
looks after you.

1291
02:07:15,088 --> 02:07:18,546
In case you're
still wondering,

1292
02:07:18,625 --> 02:07:21,651
this is called
a suprasternal notch.

1293
02:07:25,565 --> 02:07:29,057
Come and visit us in Dorset
when all this nonsense is over.

1294
02:07:35,008 --> 02:07:37,204
You'll never come
to Dorset.

1295
02:07:46,820 --> 02:07:50,586
<i>So,you didn't know</i>
<i>Madox shot himself.</i>

1296
02:07:53,761 --> 02:07:55,695
No.

1297
02:07:55,763 --> 02:07:58,459
And you didn't kill
the Cliftons?

1298
02:08:06,408 --> 02:08:08,376
Sh--

1299
02:08:14,649 --> 02:08:16,583
She--

1300
02:08:19,721 --> 02:08:22,588
She die--

1301
02:08:22,657 --> 02:08:24,648
She--
I can't.

1302
02:08:28,664 --> 02:08:30,598
Well,

1303
02:08:31,801 --> 02:08:34,395
maybe I did.

1304
02:08:38,507 --> 02:08:41,271
Maybe I did.

1305
02:08:47,717 --> 02:08:50,515
<i>I was packing up</i>
<i>our base camp...</i>

1306
02:08:50,586 --> 02:08:53,317
<i>at the Cave of Swimmers.</i>

1307
02:08:53,390 --> 02:08:58,054
<i>Clifton had offered to fly down</i>
<i>from Cairo to collect me.</i>

1308
02:08:58,128 --> 02:09:01,154
<i>He flew like</i>
<i>a madman always,</i>

1309
02:09:01,231 --> 02:09:03,791
<i>so I</i>--
<i>I took no notice.</i>

1310
02:09:12,409 --> 02:09:13,467
Aaah!

1311
02:09:40,336 --> 02:09:42,363
- Katharine?

1312
02:09:42,440 --> 02:09:46,275
Dear God, Katharine,
what are you doing here?

1313
02:09:46,345 --> 02:09:49,781
I can't get out.
I can't move.

1314
02:09:53,319 --> 02:09:55,787
''Surprise,''
he said.

1315
02:09:57,189 --> 02:09:59,851
Poor Geoffrey.

1316
02:09:59,925 --> 02:10:04,658
He knew. He must've
known all the time.

1317
02:10:04,730 --> 02:10:08,166
He was shouting, ''I love you, Katharine.
I love you so much.''

1318
02:10:10,637 --> 02:10:13,071
Is he badly hurt?

1319
02:10:14,708 --> 02:10:16,835
I have to
get you out.

1320
02:10:16,910 --> 02:10:19,344
- Please don't move me.
- I have to get you out.

1321
02:10:19,412 --> 02:10:23,178
- It hurts too much.
- I know, darling, I know. I'm sorry.

1322
02:10:23,249 --> 02:10:25,183
Come on.

1323
02:10:26,453 --> 02:10:28,785
Now!

1324
02:10:46,941 --> 02:10:49,273
Why did you hate me?

1325
02:10:49,343 --> 02:10:51,277
What?

1326
02:10:53,781 --> 02:10:56,409
Don't you know
you drove everybody mad?

1327
02:10:56,484 --> 02:10:59,977
Shh.
Don't talk.

1328
02:11:00,055 --> 02:11:02,353
You speak so many
bloody languages...

1329
02:11:02,424 --> 02:11:04,858
and you never
want to talk.

1330
02:11:10,966 --> 02:11:14,265
- <i>You're wearing the thimble.</i>
- Of course.

1331
02:11:14,336 --> 02:11:16,896
You idiot.

1332
02:11:16,972 --> 02:11:20,635
I always wear it.
I've always worn it.

1333
02:11:20,709 --> 02:11:23,143
I've always loved you.

1334
02:11:58,882 --> 02:12:00,873
It's so cold.

1335
02:12:00,951 --> 02:12:03,476
I know.
I'm sorry.

1336
02:12:05,756 --> 02:12:08,190
I'll make a fire.

1337
02:12:12,396 --> 02:12:15,263
<i>Did you get Geoffrey</i>
<i>out of the plane?</i>

1338
02:12:15,332 --> 02:12:18,234
- Yes, I did.
- <i>Good. That's good. Thank you.</i>

1339
02:12:23,074 --> 02:12:25,338
Listen to me,
Katharine.

1340
02:12:25,410 --> 02:12:27,901
You've broken
your ankle...

1341
02:12:27,979 --> 02:12:30,504
and I'm going to have
to try and bind it.

1342
02:12:30,582 --> 02:12:33,142
I think you've also
broken your wrist...

1343
02:12:33,218 --> 02:12:36,813
and maybe some ribs, which is why
it's hurting you to breathe.

1344
02:12:36,888 --> 02:12:39,482
<i>I'm going to have to</i>
<i>walk to El Taj.</i>

1345
02:12:39,557 --> 02:12:43,392
Although, given all the traffic
in the desert these days,

1346
02:12:43,462 --> 02:12:47,091
I'm bound to bump into
one army or another.

1347
02:12:47,166 --> 02:12:50,602
<i>And then I'll come back</i>
<i>and you'll be fine.</i>

1348
02:12:50,669 --> 02:12:52,728
You promise?

1349
02:12:52,805 --> 02:12:55,899
<i>I wouldn't want</i>
<i>to die here.</i>

1350
02:12:57,076 --> 02:12:59,544
I don't want to die
in the desert.

1351
02:13:03,282 --> 02:13:06,217
I've always had a rather
elaborate funeral in mind.

1352
02:13:08,188 --> 02:13:10,554
<i>Particular hymns.</i>

1353
02:13:10,624 --> 02:13:13,559
And I know exactly
where I want to be buried.

1354
02:13:15,028 --> 02:13:18,725
In our garden,
where I grew up...

1355
02:13:18,798 --> 02:13:21,858
with a view of the sea.

1356
02:13:21,935 --> 02:13:24,733
So promise me
you'll come back for me.

1357
02:13:24,804 --> 02:13:27,432
I promise...

1358
02:13:27,507 --> 02:13:29,771
I'll come back for you.

1359
02:13:31,177 --> 02:13:34,045
I promise...

1360
02:13:34,115 --> 02:13:37,414
I'll never leave you.

1361
02:13:40,988 --> 02:13:43,479
You have plenty
of water...

1362
02:13:43,558 --> 02:13:45,719
and, um, food.

1363
02:13:45,793 --> 02:13:49,388
I'll open them
for you.

1364
02:13:54,201 --> 02:13:56,226
A good read.

1365
02:13:59,908 --> 02:14:01,933
Don't waste this.

1366
02:14:05,581 --> 02:14:08,015
Will you bury Geoffrey?

1367
02:14:12,854 --> 02:14:14,981
I know he's dead.

1368
02:14:17,559 --> 02:14:19,823
I'm sorry, Katharine.

1369
02:14:21,830 --> 02:14:23,765
I know.

1370
02:14:30,940 --> 02:14:34,205
Every night...

1371
02:14:34,277 --> 02:14:36,643
I cut out my heart.

1372
02:14:41,150 --> 02:14:43,448
But in the morning
it was full again.

1373
02:14:51,128 --> 02:14:53,062
Darling.

1374
02:14:54,698 --> 02:14:56,689
My darling.

1375
02:15:23,762 --> 02:15:26,993
<i>You'd better be ready</i>
<i>about half past 8:00</i>

1376
02:15:27,065 --> 02:15:29,329
Now, honey
Don't you be late

1377
02:15:29,401 --> 02:15:32,302
I'm going to be there
when the band starts playing

1378
02:15:32,370 --> 02:15:34,463
Remember
When we get there, honey

1379
02:15:34,539 --> 02:15:37,167
An invitation
to the strutter's ball

1380
02:15:37,242 --> 02:15:39,370
A very swell affair

1381
02:15:39,445 --> 02:15:41,879
All the highbrows
will be there

1382
02:15:41,947 --> 02:15:45,610
I'll be down to get you
in a taxi, honey

1383
02:15:45,685 --> 02:15:49,849
<i>I stopped at noon</i>
<i>and at twilight.</i>

1384
02:15:49,922 --> 02:15:54,382
<i>Three days there on foot,</i>
<i>I told her,</i>

1385
02:15:54,460 --> 02:15:58,396
<i>and three hours</i>
<i>back by car.</i>

1386
02:16:00,466 --> 02:16:03,094
<i>Don't go anywhere.</i>

1387
02:16:04,103 --> 02:16:06,038
<i>I'll be back.</i>

1388
02:16:09,009 --> 02:16:11,273
<i>I'll be back.</i>

1389
02:16:28,095 --> 02:16:30,394
Just walked in
from the desert, sir.

1390
02:16:31,632 --> 02:16:34,032
<i>Morning.</i>

1391
02:16:46,781 --> 02:16:49,841
Dear golly, where have
you come from then?

1392
02:16:50,918 --> 02:16:53,284
There's been an accident.

1393
02:16:53,354 --> 02:16:55,915
I need a doctor...

1394
02:16:55,991 --> 02:16:59,324
to come with me,
and I need to borrow this car.

1395
02:16:59,394 --> 02:17:01,328
I'll pay,
of course.

1396
02:17:01,396 --> 02:17:05,298
- And I need-- I need morphine.
- May I see your papers, sir?

1397
02:17:05,367 --> 02:17:07,562
What?

1398
02:17:07,636 --> 02:17:10,969
If I could just see
some form of identification.

1399
02:17:11,039 --> 02:17:14,531
I'm sorry, I'm not making sense.
Forgive me, I-- I'm not--

1400
02:17:14,610 --> 02:17:17,101
I've been walking and--

1401
02:17:17,179 --> 02:17:22,049
A woman is badly injured
at the Gilf Kabir, the Cave of Swimmers.

1402
02:17:22,118 --> 02:17:24,814
<i>I'm a member of the</i>
<i>Royal Geographical Society.</i>

1403
02:17:24,888 --> 02:17:27,550
Right.

1404
02:17:27,624 --> 02:17:31,060
Now, if I could...
just take your name.

1405
02:17:34,063 --> 02:17:38,727
Count Laszlo de Almasy.

1406
02:17:40,970 --> 02:17:45,031
''Almasy.'' Would you mind
spelling that for me?

1407
02:17:45,108 --> 02:17:48,306
- Look, listen to me, will you?
- What nationality would that be?

1408
02:17:48,379 --> 02:17:52,577
A woman is dying.
My wife is dying.

1409
02:17:52,650 --> 02:17:56,848
I have been... walking--

1410
02:17:58,222 --> 02:18:00,816
<i>I have been walking</i>
<i>for three days.</i>

1411
02:18:00,891 --> 02:18:03,359
I do not want
to spell my name.

1412
02:18:03,427 --> 02:18:06,658
- I want you to give me this car.
- I understand you're agitated.

1413
02:18:06,730 --> 02:18:09,893
Perhaps if you'd like to sit down,
I can radio back to H.Q.

1414
02:18:09,967 --> 02:18:14,928
No. No, don't--
Don't radio anybody!

1415
02:18:15,006 --> 02:18:18,237
Just give me
the fucking car!

1416
02:19:18,205 --> 02:19:22,403
Stop the car, please.
A woman is dying!

1417
02:19:22,476 --> 02:19:25,001
Listen, Fritz, if I have to listen
to another word from you,

1418
02:19:25,078 --> 02:19:27,103
I'm going to give you
a fucking good hiding!

1419
02:19:27,180 --> 02:19:29,775
Fritz? What are you
talking about, Fritz?

1420
02:19:29,851 --> 02:19:31,284
Well, that's your name,
isn't it?

1421
02:19:31,352 --> 02:19:33,343
Count Fuckin' Asshole
Von Bismarck!

1422
02:19:33,421 --> 02:19:36,151
- What's that supposed to be, Irish?
- Please!

1423
02:19:36,224 --> 02:19:40,160
You have to listen!
Katharine!

1424
02:19:40,228 --> 02:19:42,958
<i>Katharine!</i>

1425
02:19:54,710 --> 02:19:57,008
Excuse me.

1426
02:19:57,079 --> 02:20:01,015
- I also need to use the lavatory.
- You'll have to wait.

1427
02:20:01,083 --> 02:20:04,883
- It's urgent.
- Sarge!

1428
02:20:04,954 --> 02:20:08,117
Sarge,Jerry wants
to use the lav.

1429
02:20:08,190 --> 02:20:10,522
Says it's urgent.

1430
02:20:12,594 --> 02:20:16,030
- Where are we going, please?
- Oh, up north to the coast.

1431
02:20:16,098 --> 02:20:18,567
Benghazi.
Soon be there.

1432
02:20:18,635 --> 02:20:20,660
<i>You can get your boat</i>
<i>back home then.</i>

1433
02:20:20,737 --> 02:20:25,197
All right, go on then.
Here, you take him.

1434
02:20:25,275 --> 02:20:28,676
I've been up and down
this bloody train all day.

1435
02:20:43,893 --> 02:20:45,987
It doesn't open.

1436
02:20:59,577 --> 02:21:02,944
Aaah!

1437
02:21:55,935 --> 02:21:58,062
<i>So yes,</i>

1438
02:21:59,572 --> 02:22:02,667
she died because of me.

1439
02:22:05,479 --> 02:22:07,743
Because I loved her.

1440
02:22:11,351 --> 02:22:13,615
Because I--

1441
02:22:16,723 --> 02:22:19,317
Because I had
the wrong name.

1442
02:22:29,270 --> 02:22:33,604
- And you never got back to the cave?
- <i>I did get back.</i>

1443
02:22:33,675 --> 02:22:36,542
I kept my promise.

1444
02:22:37,745 --> 02:22:41,044
<i>I was assisted</i>
<i>by the Germans.</i>

1445
02:22:41,116 --> 02:22:43,482
<i>There was a</i>--
<i>a trade.</i>

1446
02:22:43,551 --> 02:22:46,952
<i>I had our expedition maps.</i>

1447
02:22:47,021 --> 02:22:50,115
<i>And after the British</i>
<i>made me their enemy,</i>

1448
02:22:50,191 --> 02:22:54,094
<i>I gave their enemy</i>
<i>our maps.</i>

1449
02:23:06,509 --> 02:23:09,137
<i>So I got back</i>
<i>to the desert...</i>

1450
02:23:09,211 --> 02:23:11,679
<i>and to Katharine...</i>

1451
02:23:11,747 --> 02:23:14,045
<i>in Madox's English plane...</i>

1452
02:23:14,116 --> 02:23:16,517
<i>with German gasoline.</i>

1453
02:23:21,024 --> 02:23:23,686
When I arrived
in Italy,

1454
02:23:23,760 --> 02:23:26,456
on my medical chart
they wrote,

1455
02:23:26,530 --> 02:23:29,328
''English Patient.''

1456
02:23:29,399 --> 02:23:32,095
Isn't that funny?

1457
02:23:32,169 --> 02:23:35,570
After all that,
I became English.

1458
02:23:39,042 --> 02:23:43,070
You get to the morning and the
poison leaks away, doesn't it?

1459
02:23:46,651 --> 02:23:48,915
Black nights.

1460
02:23:52,990 --> 02:23:56,255
- I thought I would kill you.
- You can't kill me.

1461
02:23:57,628 --> 02:23:59,892
I died years ago.

1462
02:24:03,868 --> 02:24:06,530
No, I can't
kill you now.

1463
02:24:25,691 --> 02:24:28,819
We've been posted.
North of Florence.

1464
02:24:34,801 --> 02:24:38,737
I was thinking yesterday--

1465
02:24:38,805 --> 02:24:41,330
yesterday--

1466
02:24:41,407 --> 02:24:43,875
The patient and Hardy.

1467
02:24:43,943 --> 02:24:46,275
They're everything
that's good about England.

1468
02:24:47,447 --> 02:24:49,915
I couldn't even say
what that was.

1469
02:24:51,818 --> 02:24:55,914
We didn't exchange
two personal words,

1470
02:24:55,989 --> 02:24:58,652
and we've been together
through some terrible things.

1471
02:24:58,726 --> 02:25:01,092
<i>Some terrible things.</i>

1472
02:25:01,161 --> 02:25:05,291
He was engaged
to a girl in the village.

1473
02:25:05,366 --> 02:25:07,960
I mean--

1474
02:25:08,035 --> 02:25:12,199
And us,
he never once--

1475
02:25:12,273 --> 02:25:17,677
He didn't ask me if I could spin
the ball at cricket or Kamasutra or--

1476
02:25:31,026 --> 02:25:33,654
I don't even know
what I'm talking about.

1477
02:25:33,728 --> 02:25:36,663
You loved him.

1478
02:27:00,418 --> 02:27:02,386
Katharine.

1479
02:27:15,901 --> 02:27:18,529
I'm still here.

1480
02:27:19,972 --> 02:27:22,600
You'd better be.

1481
02:27:22,674 --> 02:27:25,472
Don't depend on it,
will you?

1482
02:27:26,779 --> 02:27:30,146
That little bit of air
in my lungs,

1483
02:27:30,215 --> 02:27:33,913
each day
it gets less and less.

1484
02:27:35,388 --> 02:27:37,720
Which is all right.

1485
02:27:37,791 --> 02:27:40,225
It's quite all right.

1486
02:27:42,328 --> 02:27:45,695
I've been speaking
to Caravaggio,

1487
02:27:45,765 --> 02:27:48,700
my research assistant.

1488
02:27:48,768 --> 02:27:52,295
He tells me there's a ghost
in the cloisters.

1489
02:27:53,673 --> 02:27:56,199
I can join him.

1490
02:27:58,345 --> 02:28:01,075
-<i>Hana!</i>
- It's the boy.

1491
02:28:25,307 --> 02:28:27,741
I'll always
go back to that church.

1492
02:28:28,743 --> 02:28:31,371
Look at my paintings.

1493
02:28:35,417 --> 02:28:37,817
I'll always
go back to that church.

1494
02:28:39,855 --> 02:28:43,188
So one day we'll meet.

1495
02:30:32,872 --> 02:30:34,806
Thank you.

1496
02:30:46,686 --> 02:30:48,950
Read to me,
will you?

1497
02:30:54,829 --> 02:30:57,263
<i>Read me to sleep.</i>

1498
02:31:20,288 --> 02:31:22,950
<i>''My darling,</i>

1499
02:31:23,025 --> 02:31:25,789
<i>''I'm waiting for you.</i>

1500
02:31:25,861 --> 02:31:29,160
<i>''How long is a day</i>

1501
02:31:29,231 --> 02:31:31,495
''Or a week?

02:31:39,941 --> 02:31:42,341
''The fire is gone now...

1503
02:31:42,411 --> 02:31:45,404
and I'm horr--
horribly cold.''

1504
02:31:47,283 --> 02:31:50,047
<i>I really ought</i>
<i>to drag myself outside,</i>

1505
02:31:50,119 --> 02:31:52,781
<i>but then</i>
<i>there'd be the sun.</i>

1506
02:31:52,855 --> 02:31:55,119
<i>I'm afraid</i>
<i>I waste the light...</i>

1507
02:31:55,191 --> 02:31:58,456
<i>on the paintings</i>
<i>and on writing these words.</i>

1508
02:32:01,731 --> 02:32:03,631
<i>We die.</i>

1509
02:32:03,700 --> 02:32:05,861
''We die.

1510
02:32:05,935 --> 02:32:09,735
''We die rich with

''tastes we have swallowed,

''bodies we have entered...

1514
02:32:18,382 --> 02:32:21,749
<i>Fears we've hidden in,</i>

1515
02:32:21,819 --> 02:32:24,083
<i>like this wretched cave.</i>

1516
02:32:30,060 --> 02:32:32,654
<i>I want all this</i>
<i>marked on my body.</i>

1517
02:32:34,998 --> 02:32:37,968
<i>We're the real countries.</i>

1518
02:32:38,036 --> 02:32:40,561
<i>Not the boundaries</i>

1519
02:32:40,638 --> 02:32:43,232
<i>the names of powerful men.</i>

1520
02:32:54,085 --> 02:32:58,021
<i>I know you'll come and carry me</i>

1521
02:33:05,929 --> 02:33:08,899
<i>That's all I've wanted,</i>

1522
02:33:08,969 --> 02:33:12,904
<i>to walk in such</i>

<i>with friends.</i>

1524
