1
00:00:10,101 --> 00:00:11,936
<i>A bit more.</i>

2
00:00:16,858 --> 00:00:18,676
<i>Georgette, hold her
so she doesn't fall.</i>

3
00:00:18,776 --> 00:00:20,236
<i>I've got her...</i>

4
00:00:20,737 --> 00:00:21,738
<i>That's it!</i>

5
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:24,057
<i>Sasha, I saw you peeking.</i>

6
00:00:24,157 --> 00:00:25,516
<i>No, not true.</i>

7
00:00:25,616 --> 00:00:27,310
<i>Denise, stop teasing your cousin.</i>

8
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:28,453
<i>Closer...</i>

9
00:00:28,703 --> 00:00:30,079
<i>Over here!</i>

10
00:00:32,498 --> 00:00:33,900
<i>You're getting warmer!</i>

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,168
<i>You got it.</i>

12
00:00:36,878 --> 00:00:38,004
<i>Open your eyes!</i>

13
00:00:40,048 --> 00:00:42,342
Happy birthday, Sasha!

14
00:00:42,925 --> 00:00:44,552
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

15
00:00:51,434 --> 00:00:54,479
The guy at the store said
it's the best book for beginners.

16
00:01:06,491 --> 00:01:08,476
Did she have secret lessons?

17
00:01:08,576 --> 00:01:13,998
No, this the first time
she's ever touched a piano, I think?

18
00:01:14,666 --> 00:01:16,000
Must be in her blood.

19
00:01:20,171 --> 00:01:22,156
Sounds like another gift!

20
00:01:22,256 --> 00:01:24,384
For real?
Should I answer?

21
00:01:24,801 --> 00:01:27,036
I thought we said
no other gifts.

22
00:01:27,136 --> 00:01:29,472
I'm allowed to spoil her.
She's my only niece.

23
00:01:30,098 --> 00:01:32,684
No, Denise,
that's for me!

24
00:01:33,935 --> 00:01:35,753
It is I,
Rico the Rooster!

25
00:01:35,853 --> 00:01:38,356
Honk my snout
and I'll twist and shout.

26
00:01:38,606 --> 00:01:40,091
A clown!

27
00:01:40,191 --> 00:01:41,192
Yup.

28
00:01:46,656 --> 00:01:47,657
Hello.

29
00:01:47,907 --> 00:01:50,076
Welcome, Mr. Rico.

30
00:01:53,997 --> 00:01:55,832
Left, then right.

31
00:01:56,082 --> 00:01:58,710
Swing all around,
left, right.

32
00:02:04,465 --> 00:02:05,883
With your hands.

33
00:02:06,843 --> 00:02:08,136
Don't get dizzy now!

34
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:19,355
And a round of applause.

35
00:02:20,398 --> 00:02:22,734
Aren't clowns
supposed to be funny?

36
00:02:23,776 --> 00:02:27,572
Well... the art of clowning is vast.

37
00:02:30,408 --> 00:02:31,601
I can do magic.

38
00:02:31,701 --> 00:02:33,953
-Do you like magic?
-Yes, magic!

39
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:37,273
OK, I need...

40
00:02:37,373 --> 00:02:39,709
An item from
my magic trunk.

41
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:44,339
If I can find it...

42
00:02:46,424 --> 00:02:47,742
These are handcuffs.

43
00:02:47,842 --> 00:02:49,302
Rico's gonna
put them on,

44
00:02:49,677 --> 00:02:51,704
then lock himself
in the magic trunk.

45
00:02:51,804 --> 00:02:54,457
In less than a minute
he'll hop out,

46
00:02:54,557 --> 00:02:56,976
his hands free
and with a new hairdo.

47
00:02:59,937 --> 00:03:02,065
You can close the trunk.

48
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:20,750
I can't take this anymore.
When do we eat him?

49
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,710
I'm starving!

50
00:03:25,588 --> 00:03:27,840
Rico needs your help now.

51
00:03:29,258 --> 00:03:32,078
Sweetie, I know
your gift is amusing, but...

52
00:03:32,178 --> 00:03:33,621
he'll also be tasty.

53
00:03:33,721 --> 00:03:35,014
We have your back.

54
00:03:35,431 --> 00:03:36,724
Come.

55
00:03:39,227 --> 00:03:40,311
I'm suffocating.

56
00:03:40,645 --> 00:03:42,797
Help me, I'm gonna...

57
00:03:42,897 --> 00:03:45,191
Rico's claustrophobic!

58
00:03:47,485 --> 00:03:49,262
Rico's claustrophobic!

59
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:52,056
Come, we'll do it together.

60
00:03:52,156 --> 00:03:53,850
C'mon Sasha, I'm hungry.

61
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:55,810
It's her gift, be patient.

62
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:58,496
Your fangs will
come in on their own.

63
00:03:58,871 --> 00:03:59,872
Come!

64
00:04:00,748 --> 00:04:01,833
Thank you!

65
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:04,168
-What's going on?
-Stop screaming.

66
00:04:04,585 --> 00:04:06,587
Let me go!

67
00:04:18,641 --> 00:04:20,935
Her roots are long enough.

68
00:04:22,437 --> 00:04:24,022
Everything's there...

69
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:26,733
So why didn't they come out?

70
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,401
No clue.

71
00:04:29,944 --> 00:04:32,780
It could be
a nervous system thing.

72
00:04:39,037 --> 00:04:40,955
Daddy!

73
00:04:41,456 --> 00:04:44,208
It's all right, monkey,
we're right here.

74
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:49,113
Daddy, take this off.
I don't like it!

75
00:04:49,213 --> 00:04:50,798
Enough! Stop this!

76
00:04:52,634 --> 00:04:56,471
Dammit, I could crucify
this bloody clicker!

77
00:05:02,518 --> 00:05:04,562
This is extremely unusual.

78
00:05:07,398 --> 00:05:10,218
We should be seeing a reaction
in the hypothalamus

79
00:05:10,318 --> 00:05:12,320
when stimulated
by acts of violence.

80
00:05:13,154 --> 00:05:16,891
Instead, it's her
ventromedial prefrontal cortex

81
00:05:16,991 --> 00:05:18,743
that's all lit up.

82
00:05:25,667 --> 00:05:27,026
What does it mean?

83
00:05:27,126 --> 00:05:30,321
It means that the girl's compassion
is triggered

84
00:05:30,421 --> 00:05:32,674
by images of humans dying.

85
00:05:34,342 --> 00:05:35,510
Not her hunger.

86
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:40,473
Given all you've told me

87
00:05:40,974 --> 00:05:43,167
there's a good chance
that your daughter

88
00:05:43,267 --> 00:05:45,879
is suffering
from post-traumatic stress.

89
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:46,963
Told you.

90
00:05:47,063 --> 00:05:49,883
We couldn't know
she'd get attached to Rico the Rooster.

91
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:52,468
Couldn't we?
She empathizes with rocks.

92
00:05:52,568 --> 00:05:55,722
You must acknowledge
that your daughter needs help.

93
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:56,806
What can we do?

94
00:05:56,906 --> 00:06:00,785
Have you noticed Sasha
having obsessive thoughts?

95
00:06:05,915 --> 00:06:08,960
I'd like to keep her here
so we can probe a bit deeper.

96
00:06:12,755 --> 00:06:14,298
Aurélien, wait.

97
00:06:14,549 --> 00:06:15,800
Wait here.

98
00:06:18,469 --> 00:06:20,371
No way I'm gonna
leave her here.

99
00:06:20,471 --> 00:06:22,916
We know nothing
about post-traumatic stress.

100
00:06:23,016 --> 00:06:24,250
I know my daughter.

101
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,878
She just needs time.
Everyone has their own pace.

102
00:06:26,978 --> 00:06:30,840
It won't fix itself, the longer we wait
the more she'll be impaired.

103
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,358
"Impaired?" Come on.

104
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:35,361
Our job is to raise
an independent child.

105
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:39,782
It's also our job not to force her
into something she's not ready for.

106
00:06:42,785 --> 00:06:44,245
Come, Sasha.

107
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:10,213
Georgette...

108
00:07:10,313 --> 00:07:13,441
I won't be hunting for all of us
for the next 200 years.

109
00:07:16,944 --> 00:07:21,658
I said, I won't be hunting for all of us
for the next 200 years.

110
00:07:23,117 --> 00:07:24,994
What do you mean?
I hunt too.

111
00:07:26,954 --> 00:07:28,498
What?
I went on Monday.

112
00:07:29,499 --> 00:07:30,499
Wow.

113
00:07:31,376 --> 00:07:32,710
Congrats.

114
00:10:33,224 --> 00:10:34,918
We're out of baggies.

115
00:10:35,018 --> 00:10:37,103
I know, your mom'll go soon.

116
00:10:43,151 --> 00:10:45,862
MAN, THE THINKING ANIMAL

117
00:11:05,923 --> 00:11:09,160
We're not helping her
by letting her empty the fridge!

118
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:11,746
Hunting for two or for three,
what's the difference?

119
00:11:11,846 --> 00:11:13,581
I'm sick of you
saying that.

120
00:11:13,681 --> 00:11:17,293
-What should we do then?
-There's a million things we could do!

121
00:11:17,393 --> 00:11:19,879
Like what, take away
her piano until she eats?

122
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:23,132
-Maybe then she'd try!
-Her piano is all that she has.

123
00:11:23,232 --> 00:11:25,802
She would finally hunt, Aurélien!

124
00:11:25,902 --> 00:11:29,113
I'll never force my daughter
to kill against her will!

125
00:12:49,986 --> 00:12:52,655
Jump, or else
help me with the brats.

126
00:12:55,533 --> 00:12:56,617
I'm coming.

127
00:12:58,286 --> 00:12:59,787
Idiot.

128
00:13:27,482 --> 00:13:29,651
My shoes stink,
gimme new ones.

129
00:13:31,569 --> 00:13:33,054
This man was here first.

130
00:13:33,154 --> 00:13:35,098
-It's my birthday.
-Happy birthday.

131
00:13:35,198 --> 00:13:36,891
But there's a line, you know.

132
00:13:36,991 --> 00:13:38,893
-Let her go ahead.
-What's the problem?

133
00:13:38,993 --> 00:13:42,355
My shoes smell like cheese
and he won't gimme new ones.

134
00:13:42,455 --> 00:13:45,024
It's not your shoes that stink,
kitten,

135
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:47,502
it's my colleague Paul here
who doesn't shower.

136
00:13:47,794 --> 00:13:50,905
Don't worry, he'll give you
new ones now, right?

137
00:13:51,005 --> 00:13:52,799
Thanks Mr. Big Cheese.

138
00:13:53,549 --> 00:13:55,468
"Mr. Big Cheese."

139
00:14:17,907 --> 00:14:19,784
See you, Nacho Man.

140
00:18:19,482 --> 00:18:20,984
We need to talk.

141
00:18:22,443 --> 00:18:24,195
Are you OK, monkey?

142
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:28,700
You sure?

143
00:18:29,617 --> 00:18:31,494
Yes, why?

144
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:38,459
You'd tell us if you had
dark thoughts, eh?

145
00:18:39,377 --> 00:18:40,920
Of course.

146
00:18:41,504 --> 00:18:43,798
Then why did I find this
in your room?

147
00:18:45,174 --> 00:18:46,534
Food is dangerous.

148
00:18:46,634 --> 00:18:49,595
You could die! Tell me you
weren't planning on eating this.

149
00:18:50,805 --> 00:18:53,933
I wasn't. Someone gave it to me.
I don't know why I kept it.

150
00:18:54,475 --> 00:18:56,394
-Sasha, your fangs...
-You have fangs?

151
00:18:58,479 --> 00:18:59,856
I know.

152
00:19:00,189 --> 00:19:03,234
-That's very good news!
-No, I don't want them.

153
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:08,781
Lock me up. I'm never leaving
this house again. Please.

154
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,297
Have a seat, Sasha.

155
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,813
We've given it some thought.

156
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:47,862
We think it would be best
if you went to live with Denise.

157
00:19:51,074 --> 00:19:52,725
But why?

158
00:19:52,825 --> 00:19:54,894
Because this is not...

159
00:19:54,994 --> 00:19:57,272
This environment is not conducive
to learning.

160
00:19:57,372 --> 00:20:00,792
I won't give her so much
as a drop of blood. I promise.

161
00:20:02,794 --> 00:20:04,671
It's just until you learn.

162
00:20:05,004 --> 00:20:07,615
Your mother and I...
we might not always be around.

163
00:20:07,715 --> 00:20:10,368
It's an acquired taste.
You'll end up enjoying it.

164
00:20:10,468 --> 00:20:12,912
I don't need to kill people
to know I won't like it.

165
00:20:13,012 --> 00:20:15,039
You don't kill them,
but you do eat them.

166
00:20:15,139 --> 00:20:17,417
If you do this,
I'll die of hunger.

167
00:20:17,517 --> 00:20:19,502
Enough
with the blackmail!

168
00:20:19,602 --> 00:20:21,437
Cadavers don't grow on trees.

169
00:20:21,729 --> 00:20:24,649
You have your fangs,
you can do it.

170
00:20:26,985 --> 00:20:28,486
Sorry, Sasha.

171
00:20:30,154 --> 00:20:31,239
It's non-negotiable.

172
00:21:55,907 --> 00:21:57,659
Make yourselves comfortable, boys.

173
00:21:59,786 --> 00:22:02,372
I picked up some hitchhikers.

174
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:08,878
Pick your favourite. I'll hang him up
and show you how to bleed him.

175
00:22:09,796 --> 00:22:11,297
No, thanks,
I'm not hungry.

176
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:14,008
What's behind your back?

177
00:22:15,218 --> 00:22:16,219
Nothing.

178
00:22:19,931 --> 00:22:22,417
Hey, Denise,
what are these hooks for?

179
00:22:22,517 --> 00:22:25,144
Let me show you, boys.

180
00:22:30,817 --> 00:22:32,694
Do you like being tied up?

181
00:22:36,656 --> 00:22:37,865
Who's first?

182
00:22:38,533 --> 00:22:40,368
-Huh... me?
-Great.

183
00:22:42,662 --> 00:22:43,771
You, over there.

184
00:22:43,871 --> 00:22:45,106
What's the safe word?

185
00:22:45,206 --> 00:22:46,524
No need for that.

186
00:22:46,624 --> 00:22:47,817
Let go of me!

187
00:22:47,917 --> 00:22:50,336
I'll just pull on this chain here...

188
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:53,865
Do you like it?

189
00:22:53,965 --> 00:22:55,383
No! Stop!

190
00:22:57,302 --> 00:23:01,931
A LITTLE HELP
FOR YOUR FIRST WEEK. LOVE, DAD.

191
00:23:51,481 --> 00:23:52,940
Where are my baggies?

192
00:23:55,318 --> 00:23:57,512
-What did you do with them?
-What time is it?

193
00:23:57,612 --> 00:23:59,764
-Where are they?
-Shut up!

194
00:23:59,864 --> 00:24:01,157
They're all gone.

195
00:25:02,343 --> 00:25:04,387
Dunk these in your shoes,
Nacho Man!

196
00:25:06,097 --> 00:25:07,640
Come on, Mr. Big Cheese!

197
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:10,768
Look, my new ad!

198
00:25:11,102 --> 00:25:12,128
JEANS YOUR LIFE

199
00:25:12,228 --> 00:25:13,980
Omigod, you're so sexy!

200
00:25:15,857 --> 00:25:17,091
Too bad you're dumb!

201
00:25:17,191 --> 00:25:19,677
Shut up, asshole!
You got no future.

202
00:25:19,777 --> 00:25:20,862
No dick either.

203
00:25:27,535 --> 00:25:30,997
Guys! Drop it or
I'll tie you to the roof with it!

204
00:25:31,372 --> 00:25:33,082
Back on the post now!

205
00:25:35,626 --> 00:25:36,961
What, Paul?

206
00:25:43,384 --> 00:25:45,537
Listen up, everyone!

207
00:25:45,637 --> 00:25:47,956
That's it with all
this forgetting business.

208
00:25:48,056 --> 00:25:51,376
I told you. Next one to forget
their shoes plays in slippers.

209
00:25:51,476 --> 00:25:53,061
Careful, I knit them myself!

210
00:25:56,648 --> 00:25:58,775
Phentex for latecomers too.

211
00:25:59,025 --> 00:26:00,260
I feel generous.

212
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,427
Seriously?

213
00:26:01,527 --> 00:26:04,405
Everyone, let's get started!

214
00:26:13,331 --> 00:26:15,541
I look like a freakin' idiot
because of you.

215
00:26:16,668 --> 00:26:18,570
Yo, Team Slipper.

216
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:21,197
You playing,
or baking us some biscuits?

217
00:26:21,297 --> 00:26:23,241
Henry, stop messing around.

218
00:26:23,341 --> 00:26:25,702
Watch out,
I'm about to start handing out F's.

219
00:26:25,802 --> 00:26:28,496
Can I at least switch partners?
He sucks shit.

220
00:26:28,596 --> 00:26:30,515
That's what you get for being tardy!

221
00:26:30,765 --> 00:26:32,642
Move it, Paul. Let's go. Serve!

222
00:26:34,018 --> 00:26:37,563
Pull your head out of your ass
or I'll choke you with these slippers.

223
00:26:49,242 --> 00:26:50,868
What's the matter now?

224
00:26:59,669 --> 00:27:00,670
There!

225
00:27:35,496 --> 00:27:37,941
Understood, Paul?
You have to apologize.

226
00:27:38,041 --> 00:27:40,626
-I can't, it's dead.
-That's not funny.

227
00:27:40,918 --> 00:27:43,071
Some of our students
are traumatized.

228
00:27:43,171 --> 00:27:46,950
Watching a classmate slaughter
an innocent animal like that was brutal.

229
00:27:47,050 --> 00:27:49,118
I just put it out of its misery.

230
00:27:49,218 --> 00:27:51,955
You're the one
who smashed it to the ground!

231
00:27:52,055 --> 00:27:56,017
Seems like my son was defending
his class from flying vermin.

232
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:58,728
I'm not seeing the problem here.

233
00:27:58,978 --> 00:28:02,924
In my 30 years of service,
I've never seen anything like this.

234
00:28:03,024 --> 00:28:05,260
A kid killing an animal
in class!

235
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,928
First time for everything.

236
00:28:07,028 --> 00:28:09,280
Don't bother me again
with trivialities.

237
00:28:10,698 --> 00:28:12,700
Come on, Paul.

238
00:28:14,744 --> 00:28:18,539
What if he attacks a student next time?

239
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,041
Excuse me?

240
00:28:21,209 --> 00:28:23,945
When a child starts hurting animals

241
00:28:24,045 --> 00:28:25,838
who can tell where it'll end?

242
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:29,033
My son is not a murderer.

243
00:28:29,133 --> 00:28:31,678
I wouldn't kill anyone
other than myself.

244
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:05,069
I know you weren't a fan
of group sessions.

245
00:29:05,169 --> 00:29:08,381
But I need you
to give them another shot, okay?

246
00:29:12,885 --> 00:29:14,637
I think it might help.

247
00:29:17,682 --> 00:29:18,683
If you say so.

248
00:29:34,782 --> 00:29:36,242
Seatbelt?

249
00:29:40,997 --> 00:29:43,499
It wasn't me, I swear!

250
00:29:48,421 --> 00:29:51,991
Don't tell me you're not tempted
to kill at least one of them.

251
00:29:52,091 --> 00:29:54,844
Gotta bounce, douchebags!

252
00:30:15,198 --> 00:30:17,533
-I was gonna get it.
-What's your name?

253
00:30:18,826 --> 00:30:19,952
JP.

254
00:30:21,245 --> 00:30:24,624
Wanna have some fun
before bed, JP?

255
00:30:28,711 --> 00:30:30,129
Yeah.

256
00:30:33,716 --> 00:30:37,136
We can start this real nice and easy
in the hot tub.

257
00:30:37,929 --> 00:30:40,290
Did I tell you I have a hot tub?

258
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:42,558
Yep. It's the first thing you told us.

259
00:30:47,271 --> 00:30:50,233
How about you Sasha?
You like scotch?

260
00:30:50,817 --> 00:30:51,843
No.

261
00:30:51,943 --> 00:30:54,178
My dad's got a nice collection.

262
00:30:54,278 --> 00:30:57,140
Or maybe cigars are more your thing?

263
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,434
I've got some real Cuban Montecristos.

264
00:30:59,534 --> 00:31:02,328
Oh, we're pretty easy.
We like everything.

265
00:31:04,247 --> 00:31:06,416
<i>Viva la vida de loca!</i>

266
00:31:10,795 --> 00:31:13,339
When I say, "Yeah,"
you go, "Yeah," OK?

267
00:31:28,438 --> 00:31:30,465
Girls, I know it won't be easy,

268
00:31:30,565 --> 00:31:33,318
but we've got to keep quiet.

269
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:36,404
My dad's a real light sleeper.

270
00:31:45,246 --> 00:31:46,981
Go for the jugular,

271
00:31:47,081 --> 00:31:49,442
and keep feeding
until he stops moving.

272
00:31:49,542 --> 00:31:51,544
We don't want JP around
for 300 years.

273
00:31:51,878 --> 00:31:53,338
I can't do it.

274
00:31:54,589 --> 00:31:56,366
Sasha, this is it.

275
00:31:56,466 --> 00:31:58,843
Get out and bite him.

276
00:31:59,427 --> 00:32:00,912
Go! Now's the time.

277
00:32:01,012 --> 00:32:02,622
-I can't.
-I believe in you.

278
00:32:02,722 --> 00:32:04,958
-I can't.
-Go. That's enough.

279
00:32:05,058 --> 00:32:07,101
I can't and I won't!

280
00:32:08,811 --> 00:32:10,396
I won't do it.

281
00:32:15,234 --> 00:32:18,196
Then watch me
so the trip's not a total waste.

282
00:32:22,659 --> 00:32:24,327
Is your cousin OK?

283
00:33:00,238 --> 00:33:01,781
What are you doing?

284
00:33:05,410 --> 00:33:06,494
No...

285
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:47,470
HIT A ROUGH PATCH?
SOS SUICIDE IS HERE TO HELP

286
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:13,621
DEPRESSION & SUICIDE
ANONYMOUS

287
00:35:40,732 --> 00:35:42,091
Greetings.

288
00:35:42,191 --> 00:35:43,901
Take a seat and we'll start.

289
00:35:46,362 --> 00:35:48,406
A new face!

290
00:35:49,365 --> 00:35:51,200
Welcome.
What's your name?

291
00:35:52,869 --> 00:35:55,330
Nice to meet you Sasha,
and welcome.

292
00:35:56,289 --> 00:35:59,042
Would anyone like
to share their week?

293
00:35:59,459 --> 00:36:00,877
Yes?

294
00:36:01,419 --> 00:36:04,422
Sorry.
I wanted to thank Chantal,

295
00:36:05,882 --> 00:36:08,451
for the <i>Happylight</i>,
thank you.

296
00:36:08,551 --> 00:36:11,721
-My pleasure.
-It really helped.

297
00:36:12,013 --> 00:36:15,850
I'm usually useless
in the fall.

298
00:36:16,309 --> 00:36:18,770
But now, I've already
updated my resume.

299
00:36:19,062 --> 00:36:20,588
Congrats!

300
00:36:20,688 --> 00:36:24,300
...in bed the night before my race.

301
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:28,071
I felt something
touching my feet.

302
00:36:29,238 --> 00:36:31,057
I thought,

303
00:36:31,157 --> 00:36:35,620
could it be my mother
who wanted to

304
00:36:36,746 --> 00:36:38,398
wish me good luck?

305
00:36:38,498 --> 00:36:39,649
Oh, come on.

306
00:36:39,749 --> 00:36:43,294
Just because you can't see something
doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

307
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:45,822
Renaude,
I believe you.

308
00:36:45,922 --> 00:36:47,574
-Thanks.
-And I think...

309
00:36:47,674 --> 00:36:49,008
Thank you.

310
00:36:51,135 --> 00:36:55,039
Just a reminder that
we're not here to judge.

311
00:36:55,139 --> 00:36:57,892
We need to respect
everyone's beliefs.

312
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:01,688
Sasha, you haven't spoken yet.

313
00:37:02,855 --> 00:37:05,566
Is there anything
you'd like to share?

314
00:37:24,127 --> 00:37:27,547
Basically,
I'm in a very delicate position

315
00:37:29,924 --> 00:37:33,136
where I'm forced to do bad things.

316
00:37:35,179 --> 00:37:37,790
I'm not sure I understand.

317
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:40,501
What kind of bad things?

318
00:37:40,601 --> 00:37:43,062
That's not important
because I'm not doing it.

319
00:37:47,442 --> 00:37:49,861
The problem is if I don't do it,

320
00:37:51,404 --> 00:37:52,780
I'll die.

321
00:37:56,242 --> 00:37:57,727
The more I think about it

322
00:37:57,827 --> 00:38:00,413
the more I know
it's for the best.

323
00:38:02,415 --> 00:38:04,317
It's good that you came.

324
00:38:04,417 --> 00:38:08,446
We're here to help and remind each other
that death is not the solution.

325
00:38:08,546 --> 00:38:09,839
I disagree.

326
00:38:15,511 --> 00:38:17,055
Sometimes,

327
00:38:17,805 --> 00:38:20,933
death can be an interesting solution.

328
00:38:23,811 --> 00:38:25,605
Example.

329
00:38:26,272 --> 00:38:27,857
I don't enjoy life.

330
00:38:29,067 --> 00:38:30,693
And

331
00:38:31,194 --> 00:38:33,363
I'd gladly give mine up
for a good cause

332
00:38:34,489 --> 00:38:36,574
if one ever comes around.

333
00:39:07,146 --> 00:39:09,799
-Paul, are you OK to go home?
-Yes.

334
00:39:09,899 --> 00:39:11,859
-Good night, then.
-Good night.

335
00:39:36,384 --> 00:39:39,012
Did you mean what you said?

336
00:39:40,179 --> 00:39:41,889
Yeah.

337
00:39:55,361 --> 00:39:57,155
Hey, Denise?

338
00:39:58,239 --> 00:40:00,450
Ever been to Machu Picchu?

339
00:40:03,036 --> 00:40:04,037
Huh?

340
00:40:05,455 --> 00:40:07,040
-Huh, Denise?
-No.

341
00:40:09,208 --> 00:40:13,212
A little pisco sour and ceviche
on the beach sure sounds nice.

342
00:40:14,213 --> 00:40:17,967
I hope you had your fill of ceviche
'cause you'll never taste it again.

343
00:40:26,809 --> 00:40:28,353
Coming?

344
00:40:35,902 --> 00:40:38,029
Aren't you going
to introduce us?

345
00:40:38,655 --> 00:40:41,366
Paul, my cousin Denise.
Denise, Paul.

346
00:40:41,908 --> 00:40:43,184
Pleased to meet you.

347
00:40:43,284 --> 00:40:45,286
And I'm JP.

348
00:40:46,496 --> 00:40:47,897
<i>Mi casa es tu casa, bro!</i>

349
00:40:47,997 --> 00:40:49,274
This is not your <i>casa.</i>

350
00:40:49,374 --> 00:40:51,568
And what did we say
about speaking Spanish?

351
00:40:51,668 --> 00:40:52,652
No?

352
00:40:52,752 --> 00:40:54,295
Make yourself at home, Paul.

353
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:56,756
We'll be in my room.

354
00:41:00,885 --> 00:41:02,553
Denise, look.

355
00:41:03,721 --> 00:41:05,098
Denise.

356
00:41:06,349 --> 00:41:07,517
Whoa.

357
00:41:48,766 --> 00:41:50,226
Been playing long?

358
00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:52,312
Forty-three years.

359
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,733
How old are you?

360
00:41:57,483 --> 00:41:58,901
Sixty-eight.

361
00:41:59,444 --> 00:42:01,221
What's your life expectancy?

362
00:42:01,321 --> 00:42:03,431
-Depends.
-On what?

363
00:42:03,531 --> 00:42:04,849
Several factors.

364
00:42:04,949 --> 00:42:07,101
Well, approximately then.

365
00:42:07,201 --> 00:42:09,620
I know my aunt Victorine
is 375 years old.

366
00:42:09,954 --> 00:42:13,207
She's 375?
That's a lot.

367
00:42:14,375 --> 00:42:16,919
Are there retirement homes
for vampires?

368
00:42:18,212 --> 00:42:20,590
Not that I know of, no...

369
00:42:23,551 --> 00:42:25,845
Well, you certainly don't look 68.

370
00:42:28,306 --> 00:42:30,041
It's because we age more slowly.

371
00:42:30,141 --> 00:42:32,310
What happens
if you go in the sun?

372
00:42:32,769 --> 00:42:34,103
We shrivel up.

373
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:37,774
And do crosses shrivel you up too?

374
00:42:38,066 --> 00:42:39,926
-It's more like an allergy.
-To church?

375
00:42:40,026 --> 00:42:41,427
You could say that.

376
00:42:41,527 --> 00:42:43,237
I'm allergic to dust mites.

377
00:42:47,408 --> 00:42:49,494
Nice collection!

378
00:42:54,123 --> 00:42:56,751
I'm a collector myself!
Rocks and minerals.

379
00:42:58,544 --> 00:43:01,714
Geodes are my favourites.
I've got a knack for spotting 'em.

380
00:43:08,763 --> 00:43:11,808
And if you had to choose just one,
on your deathbed?

381
00:46:37,722 --> 00:46:39,932
-Should I take off my sweater?
-No.

382
00:46:46,022 --> 00:46:47,774
Tilt your head.

383
00:46:52,362 --> 00:46:54,072
Maybe I'll close my eyes.

384
00:46:54,322 --> 00:46:55,615
Good idea.

385
00:47:00,703 --> 00:47:03,831
Don't worry,
I have a high tolerance for pain.

386
00:47:28,898 --> 00:47:30,525
I'm just... I'll be right back.

387
00:48:08,146 --> 00:48:10,189
-What's going on?
-Nothing.

388
00:48:11,149 --> 00:48:14,010
Hey, this isn't some youth hostel.
Okay?

389
00:48:14,110 --> 00:48:16,763
Bad enough I'm stuck
with this dud because of you.

390
00:48:16,863 --> 00:48:19,224
-Now get back in there and finish him.
-I know.

391
00:48:19,324 --> 00:48:21,809
Your docile friend Paul
is already in your room.

392
00:48:21,909 --> 00:48:23,686
Want me to do it for you?

393
00:48:23,786 --> 00:48:25,563
-No.
-I can do it for you.

394
00:48:25,663 --> 00:48:27,540
I'll get it done.

395
00:48:30,335 --> 00:48:32,403
Let's try with the lights off.

396
00:48:32,503 --> 00:48:36,507
Or I could lie down,
to give you clear access to my throat.

397
00:48:37,717 --> 00:48:39,218
Is there anything you'd like?

398
00:48:39,636 --> 00:48:40,678
What?

399
00:48:41,888 --> 00:48:43,306
A dying wish.

400
00:48:45,141 --> 00:48:47,060
-I dunno.
-Dying wishes are crucial.

401
00:48:50,188 --> 00:48:52,590
-I don't have one.
-Everyone has one.

402
00:48:52,690 --> 00:48:53,816
Yeah?

403
00:48:56,986 --> 00:48:58,513
I never thought about it.

404
00:48:58,613 --> 00:49:00,615
-I'd be much more comfortable.
-For real?

405
00:49:03,076 --> 00:49:04,243
Well...

406
00:49:05,453 --> 00:49:07,163
I'd love to tear Henry a new one.

407
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:12,001
Let's tear Henry a new one.

408
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,551
What are you doing?

409
00:49:21,010 --> 00:49:22,328
You're leaving?

410
00:49:22,428 --> 00:49:24,581
We're off to fulfil
his dying wish.

411
00:49:24,681 --> 00:49:26,849
His dying wish?

412
00:50:04,137 --> 00:50:06,347
He might be in the back.
Wait here?

413
00:50:57,732 --> 00:50:58,983
Miranda?

414
00:51:00,026 --> 00:51:02,820
Paul! Thank God!
Can you sort the shoes?

415
00:51:03,529 --> 00:51:05,723
Sorry. Not working.
Where's Henry?

416
00:51:05,823 --> 00:51:08,701
Fucker called in sick
to go to Jonathan's party.

417
00:51:10,536 --> 00:51:13,122
Help me. They're getting angry.

418
00:51:15,667 --> 00:51:17,068
Can't. I'm with someone.

419
00:51:17,168 --> 00:51:19,921
C'mon! I can't do
every fucking thing by myself!

420
00:51:21,047 --> 00:51:22,090
Just that one group.

421
00:51:23,716 --> 00:51:25,426
Hey there beautiful Miranda.

422
00:51:25,927 --> 00:51:28,471
Another pitcher
of Long Island Iced Tea, please.

423
00:51:29,347 --> 00:51:32,308
Can't you just drink beer
like everyone else?

424
00:52:02,338 --> 00:52:04,048
What the fuck? My beer!

425
00:52:44,630 --> 00:52:46,382
Sorry for the wait.

426
00:52:46,716 --> 00:52:49,344
Henry bailed so I had
to handle the shoe counter.

427
00:52:51,679 --> 00:52:53,097
Do you know where he went?

428
00:52:54,557 --> 00:52:56,142
He's at a party.

429
00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:58,936
Okay, so let's go.

430
00:53:12,408 --> 00:53:13,951
Seriously, no.

431
00:53:15,370 --> 00:53:18,081
I can't tell him to fuck off
in front of everybody.

432
00:53:23,294 --> 00:53:25,213
If you don't do it,
I can't kill you.

433
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:29,968
I guess I can think up
another dying wish.

434
00:53:31,219 --> 00:53:32,303
Like what?

435
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:34,289
I don't know.

436
00:53:34,389 --> 00:53:37,183
Anything that won't leave me
dying of shame.

437
00:53:37,684 --> 00:53:40,436
I almost shat myself
on the way to the bowling alley.

438
00:53:41,437 --> 00:53:43,856
Maybe you could practise
on someone else?

439
00:53:44,190 --> 00:53:45,733
Might boost your confidence.

440
00:54:26,607 --> 00:54:28,109
I came to tell you...

441
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:31,612
Take your jeans and shove 'em,
Mélissa Bessette!

442
00:54:36,576 --> 00:54:38,536
Shit! They wrecked your ad!

443
00:54:39,829 --> 00:54:41,414
C'mon!

444
00:54:51,799 --> 00:54:53,009
Whatcha doin' here?

445
00:54:53,468 --> 00:54:55,428
You like F's?
Well, F you, Mr. Goyette!

446
00:54:59,474 --> 00:55:01,042
That's leather, you little turd!

447
00:55:01,142 --> 00:55:03,269
Stop, stop!

448
00:55:05,647 --> 00:55:06,898
Stop!

449
00:55:08,441 --> 00:55:09,442
Come back here!

450
00:55:16,824 --> 00:55:18,660
Paul?
What do you want?

451
00:55:23,164 --> 00:55:24,165
What's that?

452
00:55:26,209 --> 00:55:28,086
Go to hell, Mrs. Gauvin!

453
00:55:33,383 --> 00:55:34,717
Paul!

454
00:55:37,595 --> 00:55:39,597
You pick up this bat right now!

455
00:56:11,337 --> 00:56:13,214
I killed it! Don't you think?

456
00:56:31,232 --> 00:56:32,525
You OK?

457
00:56:36,988 --> 00:56:39,157
How long have you been suicidal?

458
00:56:44,787 --> 00:56:46,497
That's a very good question.

459
00:56:51,377 --> 00:56:53,087
Since forever, I think.

460
00:56:56,924 --> 00:57:00,553
I was even born with the umbilical cord
around my neck.

461
00:57:02,138 --> 00:57:04,682
I thought humans feared death.

462
00:57:06,934 --> 00:57:09,646
I think people
are just afraid of suffering.

463
00:57:18,112 --> 00:57:19,697
Or of being alone.

464
00:57:28,706 --> 00:57:31,292
Do you mind if we make one last stop?

465
00:57:55,984 --> 00:57:57,944
Don't worry,
my mom's at work.

466
00:58:38,109 --> 00:58:39,902
I'm almost done.

467
00:59:28,701 --> 00:59:30,328
Now I'm ready.

468
00:59:36,417 --> 00:59:39,045
MOM

469
00:59:46,052 --> 00:59:47,620
You're home early.

470
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:49,138
Nope.

471
00:59:50,807 --> 00:59:52,809
What are you still doing up?

472
00:59:54,310 --> 00:59:55,645
Nothing.

473
00:59:57,021 --> 00:59:58,523
I'm going to a party.

474
00:59:59,107 --> 01:00:00,817
-A party?
-Yup.

475
01:00:01,901 --> 01:00:04,320
-With people and loud music?
-Right. A party.

476
01:00:10,702 --> 01:00:12,662
Mom, this is Sasha.

477
01:00:14,497 --> 01:00:17,959
Oh, I didn't know
you brought a friend home.

478
01:00:21,337 --> 01:00:23,923
It's a real pleasure
to meet you, Sasha.

479
01:00:26,592 --> 01:00:28,303
I'm Sandrine.

480
01:00:29,470 --> 01:00:31,055
His mother.

481
01:00:31,848 --> 01:00:33,391
Charmed.

482
01:00:38,730 --> 01:00:39,814
Okay.

483
01:00:42,817 --> 01:00:45,236
Well... Goodbye.

484
01:00:45,987 --> 01:00:47,238
Yeah.

485
01:00:59,083 --> 01:01:00,126
I love you.

486
01:01:01,878 --> 01:01:03,379
I love you too.

487
01:01:08,843 --> 01:01:10,511
Have fun, eh?

488
01:02:02,605 --> 01:02:04,607
How you doin' bro?

489
01:02:07,276 --> 01:02:08,720
Where's your drink.

490
01:02:08,820 --> 01:02:10,196
There he is.

491
01:02:13,616 --> 01:02:15,368
Wish me luck.

492
01:02:19,580 --> 01:02:22,709
Oh shit! Nacho Man
is in the house!

493
01:02:23,334 --> 01:02:25,628
Paulo, Paulo, Paulo!

494
01:02:26,004 --> 01:02:28,589
Your mother let you out, Paulie boy?

495
01:02:30,299 --> 01:02:32,969
It's like I can see through your skin.

496
01:02:33,636 --> 01:02:35,638
I got a riddle for you, Paulie.

497
01:02:36,472 --> 01:02:39,934
What do you call cheese
that isn't yours?

498
01:02:42,103 --> 01:02:43,855
Nacho cheese.

499
01:02:44,272 --> 01:02:45,648
Good answer!

500
01:03:07,045 --> 01:03:08,087
Fuck off!

501
01:03:08,338 --> 01:03:10,631
What a fucking sicko!

502
01:03:12,842 --> 01:03:14,927
-He's bleeding!
-Come on.

503
01:03:16,721 --> 01:03:18,473
Come back here, asshole!

504
01:03:39,702 --> 01:03:41,329
What are you doing?

505
01:04:14,904 --> 01:04:16,906
You need to feed.

506
01:04:17,532 --> 01:04:19,058
I've already cut myself.

507
01:04:19,158 --> 01:04:20,159
No.

508
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:29,652
Are you mad because I bit Henry?

509
01:04:29,752 --> 01:04:32,030
Because that was purely circumstantial.

510
01:04:32,130 --> 01:04:35,158
I didn't mean to steal your thunder.
I was sort of inspired.

511
01:04:35,258 --> 01:04:37,343
That has nothing to do with it.

512
01:04:40,722 --> 01:04:44,350
You're a vampire,
it's normal for you to kill people.

513
01:04:44,892 --> 01:04:47,186
I can't, my fangs won't come out.

514
01:04:49,522 --> 01:04:51,691
But I've seen them.

515
01:04:53,568 --> 01:04:55,945
It only happened once.

516
01:05:01,159 --> 01:05:03,077
Should we re-enact the scene?

517
01:05:03,828 --> 01:05:06,456
-I can crash into a tree.
-It's pointless.

518
01:05:08,624 --> 01:05:10,126
Don't worry.

519
01:05:13,671 --> 01:05:15,548
I want to die.

520
01:05:16,632 --> 01:05:18,718
Then why are you still here?

521
01:05:27,769 --> 01:05:29,228
Spotted the asshole!

522
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:48,147
Wait.

523
01:05:48,247 --> 01:05:49,899
You little bitch!

524
01:05:49,999 --> 01:05:51,376
Watch me bite you back!

525
01:05:53,753 --> 01:05:56,673
I should've pushed you off the roof
a long time ago, retard!

526
01:06:00,093 --> 01:06:01,135
Stop!

527
01:06:06,849 --> 01:06:08,643
Get him, Henry!

528
01:06:09,519 --> 01:06:10,519
Stop!

529
01:06:10,979 --> 01:06:12,480
I'll break your fucking teeth!

530
01:06:12,855 --> 01:06:14,357
Let him go!

531
01:06:17,068 --> 01:06:18,069
Asshole!

532
01:06:18,403 --> 01:06:20,071
Not biting anymore, eh?

533
01:06:22,865 --> 01:06:24,659
Try eating your cheese now!

534
01:06:25,535 --> 01:06:26,953
Get him!

535
01:06:29,414 --> 01:06:30,832
Finish him off, man.

536
01:06:32,875 --> 01:06:34,585
I'm gonna rip your face off!

537
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:56,107
Guys, what are you doing?

538
01:07:32,435 --> 01:07:33,645
You did it.

539
01:07:38,191 --> 01:07:39,776
We gotta hide the body.

540
01:07:42,654 --> 01:07:43,863
Go.

541
01:07:45,907 --> 01:07:47,909
I'm not leaving you alone.

542
01:07:48,618 --> 01:07:50,495
You have to leave.

543
01:07:52,789 --> 01:07:54,916
-Will I see you in group?
-LEAVE!

544
01:08:22,025 --> 01:08:24,804
-Swear that you've done it.
-Where's your shovel?

545
01:08:24,904 --> 01:08:27,532
-I knew you weren't a sissy.
-We have to hurry.

546
01:08:29,449 --> 01:08:30,451
Who's this?

547
01:08:32,787 --> 01:08:34,122
That's not Paul.

548
01:08:35,206 --> 01:08:36,791
No. It's Henry.

549
01:08:37,125 --> 01:08:38,583
Who's Henry?

550
01:08:44,007 --> 01:08:45,007
C'mon!

551
01:08:48,845 --> 01:08:49,846
Lift.

552
01:08:52,056 --> 01:08:53,641
Fold his legs.

553
01:08:55,435 --> 01:08:56,476
Push.

554
01:08:58,270 --> 01:08:59,564
That's good.

555
01:09:05,695 --> 01:09:07,864
Your friend.
What'd you do with him?

556
01:09:08,406 --> 01:09:10,074
I don't wanna talk about it.

557
01:09:11,993 --> 01:09:13,786
Here. Have a wet wipe.

558
01:10:44,335 --> 01:10:46,921
No time for breaks.
Sun'll be up in three hours.

559
01:10:47,422 --> 01:10:50,550
-Help me, then.
-Your body, your grave.

560
01:10:58,391 --> 01:11:00,018
Fine, I'll give you a hand.

561
01:11:02,562 --> 01:11:05,048
But you gotta tell me
where your little Paul is.

562
01:11:05,148 --> 01:11:07,592
-What's the difference?
-Where'd you bury him?

563
01:11:07,692 --> 01:11:09,319
None of your business,
let me dig.

564
01:11:09,819 --> 01:11:11,429
What'd you do with him?

565
01:11:11,529 --> 01:11:12,613
Nothing!

566
01:11:13,156 --> 01:11:14,324
Sasha!

567
01:11:14,949 --> 01:11:17,644
You can't bring home a human
and not kill him after.

568
01:11:17,744 --> 01:11:18,911
He won't talk.

569
01:11:20,038 --> 01:11:21,497
I knew it.

570
01:11:22,457 --> 01:11:24,917
I'll take care of it.
Where does he live?

571
01:11:27,337 --> 01:11:28,463
Huh?

572
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:30,840
Where does he live?

573
01:12:07,335 --> 01:12:08,544
You OK?

574
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:17,428
Stop smiling.

575
01:12:18,012 --> 01:12:19,514
I'm not smiling.

576
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:31,092
Look, you're smiling again.

577
01:12:31,192 --> 01:12:32,302
It's just nerves.

578
01:12:32,402 --> 01:12:35,488
-My cousin really wants to kill you.
-I got that.

579
01:13:33,963 --> 01:13:36,466
What would your dying wish be?

580
01:13:42,096 --> 01:13:43,681
To see the sun.

581
01:14:29,102 --> 01:14:33,756
I made coffee. Then I realized vampires
don't drink coffee. So I drank it all.

582
01:14:33,856 --> 01:14:35,233
Sleep well?

583
01:14:36,526 --> 01:14:37,594
Yeah, you?

584
01:14:37,694 --> 01:14:39,971
No. But I explored
the 17 possible scenarios

585
01:14:40,071 --> 01:14:42,599
given we don't have passports,
can't speak English,

586
01:14:42,699 --> 01:14:46,561
I only have $525 in the bank and I threw
a dead bat at my principal's face.

587
01:14:46,661 --> 01:14:49,080
Honestly, we have no choice.

588
01:14:52,667 --> 01:14:54,752
-You have to turn me.
-No.

589
01:14:55,128 --> 01:14:57,155
-That way I can help you.
-With what?

590
01:14:57,255 --> 01:14:58,990
Killing consenting humans.

591
01:14:59,090 --> 01:15:01,701
There are tons of support groups
for suicidal people.

592
01:15:01,801 --> 01:15:02,827
No.

593
01:15:02,927 --> 01:15:05,496
I'm gonna be
such a creative humanist vampire.

594
01:15:05,596 --> 01:15:06,723
I have so many ideas.

595
01:15:08,224 --> 01:15:10,101
It's not that easy.

596
01:15:11,144 --> 01:15:13,604
-You'd never see daylight.
-I'm a homebody.

597
01:15:13,855 --> 01:15:16,049
-You couldn't eat.
-Eating is a waste of time.

598
01:15:16,149 --> 01:15:17,967
-Couldn't go to school.
-I hate it!

599
01:15:18,067 --> 01:15:19,694
What about your mother?

600
01:15:20,111 --> 01:15:22,071
-She'll understand.
-You can't tell her.

601
01:15:22,739 --> 01:15:25,783
We're vampires.
We can do whatever we want.

602
01:15:28,119 --> 01:15:30,246
It doesn't work like that, Paul.

603
01:15:30,997 --> 01:15:32,165
Please.

604
01:15:34,125 --> 01:15:37,920
It's the first time
I've ever really wanted something.

605
01:15:39,672 --> 01:15:41,716
My fangs
probably won't come in anyway.

606
01:15:42,342 --> 01:15:43,843
I thought about that too.

607
01:15:47,597 --> 01:15:52,393
Not to brag, but your fangs appear
every time you feared for my life.

608
01:15:54,020 --> 01:15:59,150
Just imagine your cousin
trying to kill me.

609
01:16:00,818 --> 01:16:02,612
That should work.

610
01:16:04,781 --> 01:16:06,532
What if it doesn't work?

611
01:16:10,870 --> 01:16:12,830
I'm willing to risk it.

612
01:16:25,718 --> 01:16:27,679
Can you give this to my mom?

613
01:16:29,472 --> 01:16:31,224
If things go wrong.

614
01:19:44,417 --> 01:19:48,546
POSSIBLE ESCAPE PLANS

615
01:19:52,759 --> 01:19:57,221
HUMANIST VAMPIRE SEEKING
CONSENTING SUICIDAL PERSON

616
01:20:32,882 --> 01:20:33,966
Daddy?

617
01:20:35,843 --> 01:20:39,263
-You turned him.
-What were you thinking?

618
01:20:39,764 --> 01:20:40,974
I said, "just you."

619
01:20:41,349 --> 01:20:43,226
We're all worried, sweetie.

620
01:20:52,235 --> 01:20:54,821
He's been struggling to breathe
for an hour.

621
01:20:56,322 --> 01:20:58,766
-He needs blood.
-And he'll be OK?

622
01:20:58,866 --> 01:21:00,602
I don't know,
but we're gonna try.

623
01:21:00,702 --> 01:21:02,729
-We could finish him off.
-Victorine!

624
01:21:02,829 --> 01:21:06,399
-No!
-We agreed to come here to help Sasha.

625
01:21:06,499 --> 01:21:11,045
We can't adopt a new relative
every time she needs a snack!

626
01:21:13,756 --> 01:21:15,758
We have standards!

627
01:21:16,050 --> 01:21:18,578
You might like me
if you give me a chance.

628
01:21:18,678 --> 01:21:20,914
I'm a person worth knowing.

629
01:21:21,014 --> 01:21:22,432
Right, Denise?

630
01:21:22,807 --> 01:21:25,143
You can't turn people
without consulting us.

631
01:21:25,810 --> 01:21:28,296
Paul's my friend,
he'd die for me.

632
01:21:28,396 --> 01:21:31,174
So, what are we waiting for?
Let's do it.

633
01:21:31,274 --> 01:21:33,968
I'd be happy to drive a stake
through his heart.

634
01:21:34,068 --> 01:21:38,072
JP, show us you're worthy
of being part of this family.

635
01:21:38,656 --> 01:21:41,576
Stick your pen
right into his heart.

636
01:21:45,038 --> 01:21:47,106
Don't touch him
or I'll stake you!

637
01:21:47,206 --> 01:21:50,944
Hold on. Nobody's driving
any stakes into anyone's heart.

638
01:21:51,044 --> 01:21:52,420
What's the matter with you?

639
01:21:52,712 --> 01:21:54,614
Paul was my decision, not yours.

640
01:21:54,714 --> 01:21:57,300
If you don't like it,
there's the door.

641
01:21:59,886 --> 01:22:01,913
I didn't realize you were so attached.

642
01:22:02,013 --> 01:22:03,831
A bag!
We need to feed him!

643
01:22:03,931 --> 01:22:05,516
-I don't have any!
-Who has blood?

644
01:22:07,226 --> 01:22:08,269
Move.

645
01:22:12,231 --> 01:22:13,299
What're you doing?

646
01:22:13,399 --> 01:22:14,859
Here, drink this.

647
01:22:16,402 --> 01:22:17,762
Hand over your baggies.

648
01:22:17,862 --> 01:22:20,682
-Not a chance.
-C'mon, we're not heartless!

649
01:22:20,782 --> 01:22:23,576
Come on Denise.
Give 'em your baggies.

650
01:22:32,377 --> 01:22:34,003
It's all I've got.
Figure it out.

651
01:22:40,635 --> 01:22:41,678
Here...

652
01:22:42,762 --> 01:22:44,180
Drink slowly.

653
01:22:44,472 --> 01:22:45,515
That's it.

654
01:22:48,309 --> 01:22:49,894
Do it slowly.

655
01:23:14,877 --> 01:23:17,463
Sorry for hitting you
with the shovel.

656
01:23:18,047 --> 01:23:20,341
It's OK,
I would've done worse.

657
01:23:24,512 --> 01:23:27,415
I really hope your friend
pulls through.

658
01:23:27,515 --> 01:23:30,059
But if he does,
you guys can't stay with me.

659
01:24:34,832 --> 01:24:36,125
Mom?

660
01:24:48,304 --> 01:24:52,125
She asked us to slow her morphine drip.
She wants to be awake.

661
01:24:52,225 --> 01:24:53,376
Her kids came by?

662
01:24:53,476 --> 01:24:55,311
Yeah, everybody did.

663
01:24:56,604 --> 01:24:58,231
She's waiting for you.

664
01:25:24,090 --> 01:25:25,383
Good evening, Françoise.

665
01:25:30,680 --> 01:25:33,558
Sandrine told us
you're ready for your concert.

666
01:25:43,526 --> 01:25:45,445
How's my hair?

667
01:25:50,658 --> 01:25:51,951
Perfect.

668
01:26:03,338 --> 01:26:04,547
Françoise...

669
01:26:08,343 --> 01:26:10,553
I got it from your garden.
