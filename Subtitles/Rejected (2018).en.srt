1
00:04:05,804 --> 00:04:09,304
She will fly to the sky...

2
00:04:12,695 --> 00:04:16,195
She'll be a bird, a bird...

3
00:04:28,285 --> 00:04:29,871
Fly.

4
00:04:44,877 --> 00:04:47,377
She said she would fly.

5
00:04:53,471 --> 00:04:54,931
She will.

6
00:05:42,137 --> 00:05:44,238
What do we do now?

7
00:05:45,642 --> 00:05:47,160
We've got to leave.

8
00:05:50,085 --> 00:05:52,051
Let's go back to the village.

9
00:05:53,887 --> 00:05:55,449
They'll kill us.

10
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,913
You'll need to be more vigilant than ever.

11
00:06:04,111 --> 00:06:06,507
Don't sleep or take Chisa.

12
00:06:34,748 --> 00:06:36,548
'House of Life'

13
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,560
It wasn't me.

14
00:12:07,503 --> 00:12:12,600
Mum, how long is it
since he's been a Servant of God?

15
00:12:15,846 --> 00:12:17,116
Who?

16
00:12:19,882 --> 00:12:22,397
The one who works in Dad's field.

17
00:12:28,254 --> 00:12:30,952
He came down from the mountain

18
00:12:31,573 --> 00:12:34,468
when you were 5 summers old.

19
00:12:37,144 --> 00:12:38,921
You were very little.

20
00:12:41,353 --> 00:12:45,671
I want to be like him,
tall, handsome and strong.

21
00:12:49,637 --> 00:12:51,905
You already are handsome.

22
00:12:54,249 --> 00:12:56,132
Maybe even too much.

23
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:09,561
From the apple didn't come the first sin,

24
00:13:12,474 --> 00:13:15,407
but rather the first

25
00:13:15,432 --> 00:13:18,155
stupid and pointless prohibition.

26
00:13:25,135 --> 00:13:28,635
It's only because the others were hungry.

27
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,343
Water is love.

28
00:14:40,342 --> 00:14:42,366
It is word of the Divine.

29
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:48,066
And five days before this event,

30
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:49,741
the old apostle Malopse,

31
00:14:50,226 --> 00:14:54,030
the One who transformed into a bird
to spy on Riva's sins

32
00:14:54,357 --> 00:14:59,089
will fly five times to warn of death

33
00:14:59,113 --> 00:15:02,084
for all eminent men.

34
00:15:02,249 --> 00:15:04,593
It is word of the Divine.

35
00:15:04,644 --> 00:15:05,983
Childhood

36
00:15:07,176 --> 00:15:09,538
is the Devil's playground.

37
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:13,593
Sin takes root in your little bodies

38
00:15:13,618 --> 00:15:15,340
with much ease

39
00:15:16,762 --> 00:15:20,022
and contaminates others with dark thoughts.

40
00:15:21,554 --> 00:15:23,835
I know about your thoughts, I know.

41
00:15:25,056 --> 00:15:27,241
Because I can read your minds.

42
00:15:28,467 --> 00:15:31,085
Innocence does not exist.

43
00:15:32,836 --> 00:15:35,552
Only ignorance does.

44
00:15:35,578 --> 00:15:36,335
Sir,

45
00:15:36,847 --> 00:15:39,655
how did they discover that the Chisa
was the flower of the Devil?

46
00:15:41,621 --> 00:15:44,499
We have now understoof the Truth.

47
00:15:45,019 --> 00:15:48,014
We have understood the evil it brings.

48
00:15:48,495 --> 00:15:51,655
It is the worst danger for men.

49
00:15:52,525 --> 00:15:54,662
Even worse than deth,

50
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:57,029
because it brings about spiritual death

51
00:15:57,073 --> 00:15:58,514
for those who touch the flower.

52
00:15:59,177 --> 00:16:00,381
And you all know that.

53
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:03,310
Like that flower,

54
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,474
hat seems so innocent just like you...

55
00:16:06,637 --> 00:16:08,893
But it is fed by the very blood

56
00:16:08,917 --> 00:16:11,475
of the Evil One who lives beneath us.

57
00:16:12,061 --> 00:16:15,065
It's there to tempt us
with its sweet taste.

58
00:16:15,089 --> 00:16:17,507
It is His own blood!

59
00:16:17,842 --> 00:16:20,396
Those who fell to temptation live

60
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:23,139
a life of solitude and rejection.

61
00:16:24,699 --> 00:16:26,697
But... The Devil's blood is sweet?

62
00:16:26,877 --> 00:16:27,803
Yes.

63
00:16:28,361 --> 00:16:31,029
But the Chisa was here before us men, no?

64
00:16:32,336 --> 00:16:34,174
From the creation of the world.

65
00:16:34,198 --> 00:16:36,139
So it was also evil before us?

66
00:16:36,889 --> 00:16:38,307
But... For hom was it bad then?

67
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:41,413
One should not even
think of these things!

68
00:16:41,438 --> 00:16:44,221
But they say that with Chisa
one sees the sky...

69
00:16:44,245 --> 00:16:47,226
and... the stars, and Truth.

70
00:16:47,251 --> 00:16:48,599
Who said this?

71
00:16:48,838 --> 00:16:50,287
The Devil Himself!

72
00:16:50,572 --> 00:16:53,158
It is Evil personified!

73
00:16:53,182 --> 00:16:55,514
It is the Devil in person!

74
00:16:56,514 --> 00:16:58,135
You want to see Truth,

75
00:16:58,159 --> 00:16:59,702
the truth of death?

76
00:17:00,207 --> 00:17:01,967
well then cut open your throat

77
00:17:01,992 --> 00:17:03,550
and you'll see the Truth!

78
00:17:03,586 --> 00:17:04,732
But have you tried it?

79
00:17:04,986 --> 00:17:06,768
How do they know if

80
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:08,170
no one has come back from death?

81
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:10,501
With your blood

82
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:12,474
the infection will be cured!

83
00:21:43,027 --> 00:21:45,496
- Get to the mountain, with the other dirt!
- Dad!

84
00:21:45,991 --> 00:21:47,871
- Go now!
- No!

85
00:21:53,927 --> 00:21:55,175
I don't want to go!

86
00:22:02,669 --> 00:22:04,370
Where will I go?

87
00:22:04,633 --> 00:22:06,169
To the mountain!

88
00:22:06,499 --> 00:22:09,222
I don't want to go there! Dad!

89
00:22:22,285 --> 00:22:23,831
How will I live?

90
00:22:24,312 --> 00:22:25,785
Along with the other filth.

91
00:22:38,987 --> 00:22:40,058
Please!

92
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:44,452
You did the needful.

93
00:23:44,824 --> 00:23:45,999
There was no option.

94
00:23:52,762 --> 00:23:55,202
It's been a while since I saw him
on the wrong path.

95
00:24:03,741 --> 00:24:06,819
Every child of this village
faces that danger.

96
00:24:09,257 --> 00:24:11,194
Our only way os to educate

97
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:14,179
the remaining ones as best we can.

98
00:24:16,975 --> 00:24:18,663
How was it for you?

99
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:29,999
It was the hardest moment of my life.

100
00:24:38,285 --> 00:24:39,538
And the most necessary.

101
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:16,861
Out of here, village beast!

102
00:27:18,015 --> 00:27:19,371
What are you stealing?!

103
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:23,079
Nothing, leave me. Just water.

104
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:25,799
Drink your own village water, you filth!

105
00:27:27,213 --> 00:27:28,381
Filth yourself,

106
00:27:28,405 --> 00:27:29,527
you're an Impure!

107
00:27:29,552 --> 00:27:31,590
Filth yourself, look at your face!

108
00:27:45,529 --> 00:27:47,472
He's been expelled, stupid.

109
00:29:01,127 --> 00:29:02,519
Come in.

110
00:30:38,668 --> 00:30:40,918
If you starve them to death,

111
00:30:41,024 --> 00:30:42,746
you'll soon be without servants.

112
00:30:43,761 --> 00:30:45,855
It's time we find a new procreator.

113
00:30:46,612 --> 00:30:48,996
We also need more variety
in the House of Life.

114
00:30:49,582 --> 00:30:51,887
Besides half of the women are with child.

115
00:30:53,034 --> 00:30:56,222
I thought that this time
we should fetch two girls.

116
00:30:58,519 --> 00:31:00,253
The agreement is unbreakable.

117
00:31:02,371 --> 00:31:03,281
Per year,

118
00:31:03,305 --> 00:31:05,316
one bleeding girl,

119
00:31:05,646 --> 00:31:06,636
and one boy

120
00:31:06,663 --> 00:31:08,492
 able to carry two buckets of water.

121
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,128
But who would complain

122
00:31:10,891 --> 00:31:12,292
since their protector has died?

123
00:31:13,362 --> 00:31:14,823
We'll send another.

124
00:31:18,978 --> 00:31:21,206
And who would go to that place
full of parasites?

125
00:31:22,415 --> 00:31:25,355
If we break the agreement, they could flee.

126
00:31:25,941 --> 00:31:28,046
And we'd be left without a place

127
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:29,347
to send out sinners.

128
00:31:30,454 --> 00:31:31,761
You'll both go

129
00:31:32,031 --> 00:31:33,198
soon and fetch

130
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,253
one male,

131
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:38,340
and one female.

132
00:33:38,418 --> 00:33:39,816
It was probably a wolf.

133
00:33:40,149 --> 00:33:41,902
It wasn't a wolf!

134
00:33:42,558 --> 00:33:43,613
It was a lunatic.

135
00:33:53,608 --> 00:33:54,464
Look,

136
00:33:54,696 --> 00:33:55,925
thanks for yesterday,

137
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:58,433
but I'm not your friend.

138
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:02,628
I'm going to leave soon.

139
00:34:59,815 --> 00:35:00,972
They're coming!

140
00:35:43,784 --> 00:35:45,496
Which girl bled this year?

141
00:35:47,736 --> 00:35:49,252
There were none this year.

142
00:35:50,301 --> 00:35:51,330
You lie!

143
00:35:52,109 --> 00:35:53,635
Come back next year!

144
00:35:54,949 --> 00:35:56,659
That was not the agreement!

145
00:35:57,362 --> 00:35:59,502
Or you hand over a girl and a boy

146
00:35:59,804 --> 00:36:01,244
or you all die.

147
00:36:01,787 --> 00:36:02,957
Take me!

148
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:08,494
To collect bunches of flowers?

149
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:16,596
If you don't bring us a bleeding girl,

150
00:36:17,104 --> 00:36:18,949
we'll burn everything here!

151
00:36:19,787 --> 00:36:21,034
Leave!

152
00:36:22,858 --> 00:36:24,221
Leave!

153
00:36:33,587 --> 00:36:35,087
Leave!

154
00:36:55,784 --> 00:36:57,159
Why don't we leave?

155
00:36:58,054 --> 00:36:59,776
Before they kill us all!

156
00:36:59,907 --> 00:37:01,407
If we leave they kill us as well.

157
00:37:01,432 --> 00:37:03,401
Where to? Here we have food!

158
00:37:04,085 --> 00:37:05,377
But that was the agreement.

159
00:37:05,666 --> 00:37:07,266
- A stupid agreement!
- I don't want to leave.

160
00:37:07,291 --> 00:37:08,237
I'd prefer to die here.

161
00:37:08,262 --> 00:37:09,299
We gain nothing that way.

162
00:37:09,468 --> 00:37:10,353
I agree.

163
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,600
Stop shouting!

164
00:37:22,643 --> 00:37:25,039
One day they see us stealing their corn

165
00:37:25,406 --> 00:37:26,463
and they'll kill us.

166
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:27,336
The corn?

167
00:37:28,653 --> 00:37:30,117
They all know you steal it!

168
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,000
They let you do it,

169
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:37,016
to make you stronger.

170
00:37:40,529 --> 00:37:41,727
And later use you.

171
00:37:47,315 --> 00:37:48,318
If you're witches,

172
00:37:49,003 --> 00:37:50,565
why don't you defend yourselves?

173
00:37:52,396 --> 00:37:53,935
I mean you have powers, right?

174
00:37:58,339 --> 00:38:00,045
Or that's what they say in the village.

175
00:38:05,222 --> 00:38:06,271
Yes...

176
00:38:07,471 --> 00:38:08,490
No...

177
00:38:12,315 --> 00:38:14,459
The thing is our teacher died recently.

178
00:38:18,654 --> 00:38:20,162
We still don't know very much.

179
00:38:49,767 --> 00:38:50,907
You shouldn't.

180
00:39:26,485 --> 00:39:29,735
They change the course of rivers,

181
00:39:33,013 --> 00:39:36,180
and the even the thoughts of men.

182
00:39:39,311 --> 00:39:42,811
They consumed all the blood of their land,

183
00:39:45,311 --> 00:39:47,407
and left them hollow.

184
00:39:51,271 --> 00:39:54,771
They spent hundreds of years writing

185
00:39:55,352 --> 00:39:56,266
guides,

186
00:39:56,902 --> 00:39:57,774
laws

187
00:39:58,503 --> 00:40:00,641
and rules for everyone.

188
00:40:05,017 --> 00:40:07,453
They invented beliefs

189
00:40:08,503 --> 00:40:09,776
to unite everyone

190
00:40:09,801 --> 00:40:11,500
in the same mistake.

191
00:40:14,706 --> 00:40:16,989
They filled libraries

192
00:40:17,013 --> 00:40:18,766
with their convictions.

193
00:40:19,714 --> 00:40:21,961
And demonstrations of their greatness.

194
00:40:24,609 --> 00:40:26,965
They would spend entire lives

195
00:40:26,989 --> 00:40:28,680
in this work.

196
00:40:29,728 --> 00:40:31,570
But it served no purpose.

197
00:40:33,167 --> 00:40:34,945
Nothing had purpose.

198
00:40:38,039 --> 00:40:39,757
Everything collapsed,

199
00:40:40,675 --> 00:40:42,156
like the waves clean

200
00:40:42,181 --> 00:40:43,773
the beach

201
00:40:43,978 --> 00:40:45,332
of detritus.

202
00:40:51,318 --> 00:40:54,593
Man always goes back to what he is

203
00:40:56,614 --> 00:40:58,507
and what he will always be:

204
00:41:03,665 --> 00:41:06,585
An agressive and confused animal.

205
00:41:15,212 --> 00:41:17,218
He's not dead, the animal.

206
00:41:23,790 --> 00:41:25,039
He has a name.

207
00:41:27,613 --> 00:41:28,890
He's called Kiva.

208
00:41:39,922 --> 00:41:40,968
Kiva.

209
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:52,297
It's really true what they say of you

210
00:41:53,741 --> 00:41:55,390
you really are witches.

211
00:42:12,027 --> 00:42:13,468
Look what I found.

212
00:42:16,412 --> 00:42:17,359
It's nice.

213
00:42:20,095 --> 00:42:22,343
Put it with the other stuff
for my big sculpture.

214
00:43:18,759 --> 00:43:19,539
I'm sorry ?

215
00:43:19,918 --> 00:43:21,007
What are you doing here?

216
00:43:23,058 --> 00:43:24,179
Sorry Dad.

217
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:27,859
Get back to the mountain!

218
00:43:32,627 --> 00:43:33,453
Mum!

219
00:43:35,394 --> 00:43:36,562
Go away!

220
00:43:36,942 --> 00:43:38,312
I don't know you!

221
00:43:38,987 --> 00:43:40,320
Mum, please.

222
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:05,476
You don't like me?

223
00:45:11,290 --> 00:45:12,617
I've got another friend.

224
00:45:13,612 --> 00:45:14,500
He's big,

225
00:45:15,035 --> 00:45:16,180
and protects me.

226
00:45:25,089 --> 00:45:26,821
He doesn't protect you at all.

227
00:45:37,741 --> 00:45:38,523
Take it.

228
00:45:39,297 --> 00:45:40,859
You'll understand everything with it.

229
00:45:42,587 --> 00:45:43,625
I know.

230
00:45:44,231 --> 00:45:46,406
 But we're too young for that.

231
00:46:57,698 --> 00:46:58,891
What is that?

232
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:04,041
They're coming to get us.

233
00:48:24,483 --> 00:48:25,311
Mum!

234
00:48:29,917 --> 00:48:30,850
Forgive me!

235
00:48:33,147 --> 00:48:34,740
You dirtied yourself with sin.

236
00:48:39,058 --> 00:48:40,131
Mum, stop!

237
00:48:44,217 --> 00:48:45,217
I'm sorry?

238
00:48:46,136 --> 00:48:47,469
I can clean myself.

239
00:48:55,461 --> 00:48:56,467
Mum!

240
00:48:57,414 --> 00:48:58,701
Leave me alone,

241
00:49:00,115 --> 00:49:01,483
son of the devil!

242
00:49:07,086 --> 00:49:08,071
Mum...

243
00:49:24,618 --> 00:49:25,547
Look at me!

244
00:49:41,660 --> 00:49:42,761
That I eat you?

245
00:49:45,530 --> 00:49:47,019
But you're very little.

246
00:50:49,201 --> 00:50:50,630
Why are you not scared of me?

247
00:50:52,018 --> 00:50:53,107
I'm a witch.

248
00:50:54,417 --> 00:50:55,544
And that spot?

249
00:50:57,636 --> 00:50:58,865
That's what you do to me.

250
00:51:00,428 --> 00:51:02,466
I know you think you're a witch,

251
00:51:03,205 --> 00:51:04,282
but you're not,

252
00:51:05,407 --> 00:51:06,396
You're good.

253
00:52:24,412 --> 00:52:26,427
Is that normal, that fire?

254
00:52:28,571 --> 00:52:29,935
That's not us,

255
00:52:30,904 --> 00:52:31,875
it's the insects.

256
00:52:32,522 --> 00:52:33,743
And the plants.

257
00:52:36,222 --> 00:52:37,818
And the flowers that fly?

258
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:40,708
And what if they want to?

259
00:52:44,412 --> 00:52:45,594
And the thunder?

260
00:52:47,329 --> 00:52:48,583
Kila got angry.

261
00:52:50,633 --> 00:52:51,872
Kila got angry?

262
00:52:52,188 --> 00:52:54,435
The only thing our teacher taught us...

263
00:52:57,052 --> 00:52:58,521
The more they hate us,

264
00:52:59,104 --> 00:53:00,412
the stronger we get.

265
00:53:05,982 --> 00:53:07,841
You mean you feed off their hate.

266
00:56:33,417 --> 00:56:34,823
Where is Joaquin?

267
00:56:38,715 --> 00:56:40,112
Where is Joaquin?

268
00:58:20,845 --> 00:58:21,962
Leave it there.

269
00:58:23,415 --> 00:58:24,970
So everyone can see evil.

270
00:58:57,962 --> 00:58:59,430
Give us the body back!

271
00:59:01,798 --> 00:59:03,594
This time we went too far,

272
00:59:04,344 --> 00:59:05,454
and you know it.

273
00:59:05,848 --> 00:59:07,754
What we know is that you're a hypocrite.

274
00:59:08,806 --> 00:59:10,809
If he wasn't your son, you wouldn't care.

275
00:59:10,833 --> 00:59:11,755
Hypocrite!

276
00:59:12,922 --> 00:59:14,251
It was his own seed.

277
00:59:15,529 --> 00:59:17,587
His own evil seed that came back to us!

278
00:59:19,007 --> 00:59:21,001
An infected one controls us.

279
00:59:24,294 --> 00:59:25,075
You

280
00:59:25,099 --> 00:59:26,688
took some Chisa!

281
00:59:27,009 --> 00:59:27,747
Chisa!

282
01:00:03,601 --> 01:00:05,210
For you Joaquin.

283
01:00:08,122 --> 01:00:09,522
For you.

284
01:00:54,318 --> 01:00:56,825
We are all butteflies.

285
01:01:04,715 --> 01:01:07,865
Earth is our crysalis.

286
01:01:12,763 --> 01:01:15,419
Some of us eat each other.

287
01:01:38,518 --> 01:01:39,736
Kila...

288
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:42,549
The storm is coming.

289
01:01:50,354 --> 01:01:51,268
Siri...

290
01:01:51,834 --> 01:01:52,768
Don't be angry.

291
01:01:54,893 --> 01:01:55,838
Kila...

292
01:01:57,081 --> 01:01:58,315
For you.

293
01:03:03,578 --> 01:03:04,914
We can hear everything.

294
01:03:39,262 --> 01:03:40,230
He's called

295
01:03:40,274 --> 01:03:41,156
Wada.

296
01:05:16,254 --> 01:05:17,176
Mum...

297
01:05:55,628 --> 01:05:57,667
You killed me with shame, son.

298
01:06:00,199 --> 01:06:01,522
I'm sorry mum.

299
01:06:03,415 --> 01:06:04,867
I didn't want to do it.

300
01:06:14,782 --> 01:06:16,003
You killed me...

301
01:08:59,327 --> 01:09:01,210
There's need for forgiveness.

302
01:09:02,762 --> 01:09:03,984
Forgive what?

303
01:09:05,202 --> 01:09:06,187
I'm prepared

304
01:09:07,051 --> 01:09:09,687
to forgive you all your evil

305
01:09:10,617 --> 01:09:12,046
if you come back to the village.

306
01:09:13,316 --> 01:09:14,622
If you come back altogether,

307
01:09:14,647 --> 01:09:16,132
they can't harm you.

308
01:09:16,398 --> 01:09:18,008
Sure, like with the other girls?!

309
01:09:21,547 --> 01:09:22,655
If you don't come,

310
01:09:23,090 --> 01:09:25,718
at least find a safer place.

311
01:09:25,895 --> 01:09:27,937
Why protect us if we're witches?

312
01:09:28,698 --> 01:09:31,124
That was only to frighten kids,

313
01:09:31,621 --> 01:09:32,976
to control them.

314
01:09:33,163 --> 01:09:34,554
You expelled me!

315
01:09:36,584 --> 01:09:38,077
I did nothing wrong!

316
01:09:42,952 --> 01:09:45,546
The village is in a state of hate.

317
01:09:47,022 --> 01:09:48,601
I control them no longer.

318
01:09:49,223 --> 01:09:51,108
You are the infected ones!

319
01:09:53,894 --> 01:09:55,335
All of you should die!

320
01:10:02,328 --> 01:10:04,633
If you come down, I'll forgive you.

321
01:10:38,519 --> 01:10:39,036
Remember:

322
01:10:39,919 --> 01:10:41,216
Water is Love.

323
01:10:42,972 --> 01:10:45,473
It is what joins you to the village.

324
01:10:59,259 --> 01:11:01,029
The Water joins us.

325
01:11:46,447 --> 01:11:48,282
We've gone too far.

326
01:11:49,045 --> 01:11:50,802
We're not acting properly.

327
01:11:51,872 --> 01:11:53,611
It's time to forgive them.

328
01:11:55,452 --> 01:11:57,154
We're not protecting anything

329
01:11:57,178 --> 01:11:58,165
acting like this.

330
01:11:59,056 --> 01:11:59,935
We're...

331
01:11:59,959 --> 01:12:01,068
Forgetting...

332
01:12:03,796 --> 01:12:05,587
of the objectives we had

333
01:12:05,782 --> 01:12:07,075
to fend off evail...

334
01:12:07,720 --> 01:12:09,025
Of which evil do you speak?

335
01:12:09,068 --> 01:12:10,025
Of yours?

336
01:12:11,138 --> 01:12:12,868
You went to the mountain

337
01:12:12,931 --> 01:12:14,671
You laid with the devils.

338
01:12:15,311 --> 01:12:16,993
You let them seduce you.

339
01:12:17,177 --> 01:12:19,154
And you ut your evil seed into them.

340
01:12:19,193 --> 01:12:20,697
You took the flower!

341
01:12:24,488 --> 01:12:26,325
Everything has taken the flower!

342
01:12:28,108 --> 01:12:29,251
And you know that!

343
01:12:33,380 --> 01:12:34,947
Let us take off our masks.

344
01:13:19,254 --> 01:13:20,707
Feel the hate!

345
01:13:26,743 --> 01:13:27,988
Feel the hate!

346
01:13:37,919 --> 01:13:39,240
Feel the hate!

347
01:14:56,419 --> 01:14:57,615
Feel the hate!

348
01:15:00,084 --> 01:15:01,622
The fountain has dried up.

349
01:15:05,224 --> 01:15:06,778
He brought us this evil!

350
01:15:09,098 --> 01:15:10,551
Feel the hate!

351
01:15:12,504 --> 01:15:14,019
Feel the hate!

352
01:16:26,628 --> 01:16:29,128
Some died

353
01:16:32,262 --> 01:16:34,988
but not yet underground.

354
01:17:21,621 --> 01:17:22,769
We know who

355
01:17:23,617 --> 01:17:24,988
stopped the flow.

356
01:17:30,085 --> 01:17:31,339
We need to go

357
01:17:33,960 --> 01:17:35,980
and finish them off

358
01:17:37,352 --> 01:17:38,331
once and for all.

359
01:19:36,962 --> 01:19:38,056
What are they doing here?

360
01:19:44,293 --> 01:19:45,458
Those witches...

361
01:19:53,244 --> 01:19:54,942
Give us the water back,

362
01:19:56,431 --> 01:19:57,911
and we'll leave you in peace.

363
01:19:59,340 --> 01:20:00,864
We won't come again.

364
01:20:42,736 --> 01:20:44,150
Let's get rid of them now.

365
01:21:07,410 --> 01:21:08,652
It's Chisa!

366
01:22:39,445 --> 01:22:40,257
It's lovely,

367
01:22:41,168 --> 01:22:41,960
thank you.

368
01:22:44,419 --> 01:22:45,132
Thank you.

369
01:22:50,338 --> 01:22:51,632
They're gone.

370
01:22:56,389 --> 01:22:57,913
We need to go down.

371
01:24:17,471 --> 01:24:18,806
They saw us,

372
01:24:20,346 --> 01:24:21,674
they judged us.

373
01:24:24,410 --> 01:24:25,630
they were dogs

374
01:24:25,655 --> 01:24:27,705
barking rabidly

375
01:24:29,846 --> 01:24:32,892
against free and solitary wolves

376
01:24:35,627 --> 01:24:38,205
that passed in front of their cages.
