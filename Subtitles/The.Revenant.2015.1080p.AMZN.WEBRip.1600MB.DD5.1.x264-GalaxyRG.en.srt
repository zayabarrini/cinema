1
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,940
Hawk.

2
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:11,480
...

3
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,820
Ah, shit.

4
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:37,330
Goddamn sumbitches.

5
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:42,330
The sumbitch got
shit for brains.

6
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,840
You seen Coulter?

7
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,340
Nope.

8
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,340
Listen up!

9
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:55,840
When them plews is cleaned,

10
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:58,360
I want you to hoop
'em up real tight.

11
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:02,350
Remember, we're not doing
no 15-pelt bales!

12
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:04,650
-     We're going 30-pelt bales!
- Fitzgerald!

13
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,440
Cap'n.

14
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:10,940
Where are we with the haul?
What are you thinking?

15
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:13,950
I'm thinking, whatever it is
they're hunting out there...

16
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:15,450
...I hope it don't need
another shot.

17
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,950
Make sure we're ready
to head out by dawn.

18
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:18,950
Been done by this morning.

19
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:20,450
I'd have liked
to be out by how,

20
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:22,450
but the men are too tired.

21
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:23,970
We're only a few days
from the fort.

22
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:25,960
We're trapped out.

23
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,460
All we have to worry
about is fresh meat
for the boys.

24
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,460
Well, you, uh, seen Coulter?

25
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:38,470
Hey, we took down
an elk. A big one.

26
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:39,970
We need help
to haul the meat back.

27
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:41,470
Let me know
when it's on the spit.

28
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:42,970
I'll help you
with it then.

29
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,990
Come on, I need your help.

30
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:47,980
We needed help when we
were loading them bales.

31
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,980
I been eating this damn
beaver meat so long...

32
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,980
...I'm starting to
miss my wife's cooking.

33
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:55,000
I'm starting
to miss your wife.

34
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:55,990
Shut up.

35
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:56,990
Help!

36
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,490
Help.

37
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:01,380
Is that Coulter?

38
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,380
You go get the Captain.

39
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,880
Jesus Christ.

40
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,390
Anybody see them?

41
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:11,390
Stay quiet.

42
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:12,890
Watch the ridge.

43
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,460
...

44
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:57,480
They got Thomas.

45
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:23,490
I can't see 'em.
I can't see 'em.

46
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,000
Get down!

47
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,000
We're surrounded!
They're everywhere!

48
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,000
Stay here! Stay here!

49
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:38,520
Paul, no!

50
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,020
They want us out
in the open.

51
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:52,520
Nobody move!
Stay where you are!

52
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,520
They want the pelts.

53
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,520
We got to get
on that boat right now

54
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:58,000
or we'll lose it all.

55
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,180
Get to the boat!
To the boat, son! Move!

56
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,180
Move, move!

57
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:28,190
Leave the furs!
Leave the furs!
To the boat!

58
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,730
Hawk!

59
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:02,720
Hawk!

60
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:04,690
Hawk!

61
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,920
Grab some pelts!
Come on, grab the pelts!

62
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:59,230
Grab the pelts!
Grab the pelts!

63
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:17,470
Give this
to my little girl.

64
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:19,800
You're coming with us.
I'll get help.

65
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,640
Leave the furs!
Leave the pelts!

66
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:32,660
Willman!

67
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:34,150
Lean on me.
Just keep going.

68
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:40,150
Get to the boat!

69
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,840
Fucking savage!

70
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:07,350
Get on the fucking boat!

71
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,360
Help!

72
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:32,870
Cut the rope!
Cut the rope!

73
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,390
Wait for Amos!

74
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:36,380
No! We go now!

75
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:37,880
Fire the cannon!

76
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:51,390
Don't leave! Wait!

77
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:55,370
and dust becomes flour...

78
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:56,870
...and when the morning
is clear...

79
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:01,390
...this child of God will meet
Jesus Christ himself. Amen.

80
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:17,740
You ready?

81
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:21,030
Hold still.

82
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:28,520
Where did you learn that?

83
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:31,030
My father was a doctor.
Bridger!

84
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:32,530
Captain,
we got a swarm of

85
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:35,030
tree niggers out here
waiting to finish the job.

86
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:41,170
Tell me you got
some kind of plan.

87
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:47,640
Glass?

88
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:51,130
Missouri's no good.

89
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:54,130
Not while the Ree's
running it.

90
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:55,630
We got to
get off this boat.

91
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:57,640
Oh, you want to
get off the boat?

92
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:01,140
Then what do we do, huh?

93
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,640
Take our furs
and sit out there
amongst the Ree

94
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,640
like a bunch of ducks?

95
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:09,150
Only safe thing to do
is track a new course
back up on land.

96
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:10,650
That'll add weeks
to the trip.

97
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:12,530
Better than floating
where they can
get eyes on us.

98
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:14,880
They got eyes on you
right now, son.

99
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:19,870
What I'm saying is
we stay on the boat.

100
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,840
Chart a course
toward the fort

101
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:23,380
and take our chances
on the water.

102
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:26,380
Glass knows
this territory best.

103
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,880
It's his job
to get us home safe.

104
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,420
Get us home safe?
                       Yeah.

105
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:31,890
Need I remind you
we already lost 32 men?

106
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:34,220
It's 33 now.
They were my men,
Fitzgerald.

107
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:36,720
I know how many I lost.

108
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:39,740
We do like Glass says.
That's the end of it.

109
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,540
We have to
set the boat loose.

110
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:57,530
If the Ree are tracking us,
they'll find it downriver.

111
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:59,030
Best course is to
hike inland to the Grand

112
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,130
and follow it to Fort Kiowa.

113
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,120
On foot?

114
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,620
It'll be winter
before we get there.

115
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:07,120
Yeah, unless
we come across a post,
trade for some horses.

116
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,120
Ain't no posts
that far over!

117
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,130
Captain, losing this boat
is a goddamn mistake.

118
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:15,130
The Ree ain't
that stupid.

119
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:17,630
We keep it,
we can lay it up
around Arrow's Peak.

120
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:19,630
Quit acting like you know
what you're talking about.

121
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,150
Ain't nobody
talking to you.

122
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,140
Who'd listen
to you anyway?

123
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:26,640
Can't find your way
out of your breeches
to take a shit.

124
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:30,140
All I'm saying is
Camp Rhulen is
just up the way.

125
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:32,160
We can hole up there.

126
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:33,650
We walk.

127
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:36,150
Yeah, I'm sure we will.

128
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:39,150
Wish my dad was a doctor.

129
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:41,660
Then he could've bought me
a captain's job.

130
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:43,160
What do we do, eh?

131
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:46,160
Pray these pelts ain't rotten
if we ever get back here?

132
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,160
Make sure
to mark this place.

133
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,660
We're leaving a fortune
under these rocks.

134
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:54,670
Glass, chart a course.

135
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:57,170
Tightest you can that
gets us around the Ree.

136
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:00,170
This ain't right.

137
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:06,180
We all know these furs
ain't gonna be here
by the time we come back.

138
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:09,180
There's no way we can
haul them all the way
to the fort.

139
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:12,190
Arikara are all through
the territory.

140
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:13,690
We'll want
our hands free.

141
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:15,190
We're gonna lose those pelts.

142
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:17,190
You rather keep the pelts
or your life?

143
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:18,690
Life?

144
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:21,200
What life you talking about?
I ain't got no life.

145
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,700
I just got living
and the only way I get that

146
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,200
is through these pelts.

147
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:27,700
Fuck!

148
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:33,220
Ain't no way I'm going home
after six months

149
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:35,710
working my ass off
like a mule...

150
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:39,210
...risking my neck,
men dying, and for what?

151
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:40,710
Damn near lost everything.

152
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,730
Job's been fucked
from the start!

153
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,220
There's the one been
fucking us.

154
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:49,720
You wonder how the Ree
got the dead drop on us...

155
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:53,240
...when Mr. Glass was
supposed to look out
for that very thing?

156
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:55,230
All them Pawnee
buddies of his.

157
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:58,230
Pawnee's as much against
the Ree as the rest of us.

158
00:16:58,230 --> 00:16:59,730
Yeah?

159
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,250
Well, what about his
little half-breed son?

160
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,240
What kind of savage
you think his mama was?

161
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,240
Oh, lay off the boy, Fitz.

162
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,250
All I'm saying is...

163
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:13,750
...a savage...is savage.

164
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,260
Hey, Glass...

165
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:25,760
...is it true what they say

166
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,260
about you shooting
a lieutenant

167
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:29,260
while living
with them savages?

168
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:35,770
Twenty-one dead soldiers
and 40 dead feathernecks.

169
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:38,770
But you and your boy the only
ones to walk out alive.

170
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:40,270
Kind of a miracle.

171
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,790
Shut up, Fitzgerald.

172
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:45,280
Is that what you did?

173
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,780
Shot one of your own
to save this little dog here?

174
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:52,800
Why? Was he playing with
this little boy's mama, huh?

175
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:55,290
Did he kill her?

176
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:58,790
Hey, you can quit
polishing that rifle
when I'm talking to you.

177
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:00,290
I'm working on it.

178
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:02,310
You can work on it
when I'm done talking
to you.

179
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,300
Look at me.

180
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,300
That's enough!

181
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,800
You're forgetting
your place, boy.

182
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:12,320
As far as I can tell,
my place is here

183
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:14,310
on the smart end
of this rifle.

184
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:16,810
You move along, Fitzgerald.

185
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:19,780
That's an order!

186
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:20,810
Listen!

187
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,830
There's only a couple hours
of light left.

188
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,820
We got to stash these pelts
and get rid of the boat.

189
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,700
Let's go!

190
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:09,910
Beckett!

191
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,920
Weston!

192
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,920
Why are
they not jumping?

193
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,420
It looks like
they changed their minds.

194
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:25,430
Smart sumbitches.

195
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:27,460
Smart.

196
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:35,970
I ought to be on that boat.

197
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,480
They did the right thing.

198
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:17,910
Was it the right decision?

199
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:20,330
Leaving the boat?

200
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:24,750
The Ree own that river.
They would've flanked us.

201
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:27,250
We stay east of the Grand
through the mountains,

202
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,750
we cut a week off our trip.

203
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:31,760
Lands are bone dry up there.
Nothing for the Ree to hunt.

204
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,260
Except us.

205
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,760
Except us.

206
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:46,770
Is it true
what Fitzgerald said?

207
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:49,270
Is that why you
came out here to the
edge of the world?

208
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,280
Glass?

209
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,780
I do like the quiet.

210
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,700
Your boy...

211
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,200
...he's seen a lot.

212
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,200
He got a mother
you need to get him back to?

213
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,040
Mr. Glass!

214
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:08,040
There are cubs here!

215
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:13,050
We got cubs here!

216
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,570
Christ Almighty.

217
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,560
He's down here!

218
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:28,570
- Keep your eyes open.
- There's bears around.

219
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:30,570
I need your help now!

220
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:35,570
Oh, my God.

221
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:40,390
Get me rags now!

222
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:43,880
Give me rags before
he bleeds out. Rags.

223
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:47,220
Prepare the kit. Bridger!
You hold that.

224
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:50,300
Easy. Oh, my God.

225
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:52,650
Got to give him
credit for taking that grizz
down with him.

226
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,720
He shouldn't have shot.

227
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:56,240
The place is crawling
with tree niggers.

228
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:58,730
That's enough!
That's enough!

229
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:00,730
We're still
in Ree territory.

230
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:02,600
He's one of our own men.

231
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:07,020
Scout a circle around us.
North and west.

232
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:08,400
Take those two with you.

233
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:10,420
Bill, Fryman,
you take south and east.

234
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:13,410
Watch for anyone that
might've heard that shot.

235
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:15,410
We have to stitch him up.

236
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:18,410
What about me? Captain?

237
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:19,930
You just stay here.

238
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,420
Hold it down.

239
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:22,920
I'm so sorry, Mr. Glass.

240
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:25,420
Bridger,
press down here.

241
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:27,920
He's bleeding
down here, too.

242
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:31,760
They're torturing the bastard.

243
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,050
The proper thing to do
would be...

244
00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:36,550
...to finish him off quick.

245
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:39,550
Unless he has a chance
of pulling through.

246
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:42,570
Pulling through?

247
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:45,060
You saw what that grizz
did to him.

248
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,560
He'll be dead
inside an hour.

249
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,560
Mmm-hmm.

250
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:52,070
Yeah, we all will be if he
don't quit wailing like that.

251
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:57,950
Toward you and
twist it into place.
I'll hold him. Go.

252
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,080
Pa.
        Hold him. Go.

253
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,330
Go!

254
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:03,660
Now!

255
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:11,250
He passed out.

256
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:13,750
I'll take advantage
and stitch up his neck.

257
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:15,770
Water.

258
00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:26,280
Bridger, tell the others
we'll camp here tonight.

259
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:24,280
I want everybody up
at the crack of dawn.

260
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,450
Carrying Glass
will be hard...

261
00:34:26,450 --> 00:34:29,500
...so we need to get ahead
as far as possible.

262
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:32,180
We'll divide into two groups.

263
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:35,340
Fitzgerald, Jones, Fryman,

264
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,760
you take the east side
of the river.

265
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,760
Anderson, you scout up front.

266
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,800
That claw don't
belong to you.

267
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:46,800
It ain't for me.

268
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:34,510
Stop!

269
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:04,640
Don't let him down!
Don't let him down!

270
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,220
Watch it.

271
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:19,820
How we gonna
make it up this?

272
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:21,310
Slow down.

273
00:36:21,310 --> 00:36:23,810
It's killing us, Captain!

274
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:33,320
Lift it, Bridger!

275
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,320
Goddamn it,
keep it steady.

276
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:36,340
Lift it up higher.

277
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:37,830
I am.

278
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:41,330
And heave!

279
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:44,830
I'll go up and pull.

280
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,560
My foot!

281
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,560
Enough of this shit!

282
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:57,560
We'll never make it across
like this, Captain.

283
00:36:57,570 --> 00:36:59,580
He's burning up.

284
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:04,070
Cap'n, you ain't doing us
nor him no favors...

285
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:07,070
...by letting him go on
suffering like this.

286
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,860
Captain, it's all
the same up here.

287
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:14,860
We're gonna have to go back.
Find another way.

288
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,870
Glass. Hugh.

289
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:28,380
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

290
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:30,880
Lay that rag over his eyes,
Mr. Bridger.

291
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,880
What?

292
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,380
Lay the rag over his eyes.

293
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:34,880
Wait!

294
00:37:34,890 --> 00:37:35,900
I'm sorry, Hugh.

295
00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:37,390
Sir, I can't do that.

296
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:38,890
How do we
get back without him?

297
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:40,890
Only he knows the way.

298
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:41,890
Lay the rag
over his eyes.

299
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:42,860
I can't.

300
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,390
Wait! How do we get back--

301
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,900
Lay it over his eyes!

302
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:52,400
Step back.

303
00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:57,920
Bridger, stop!
Bridger, Henry.

304
00:37:57,910 --> 00:37:59,910
Henry! Henry, please.

305
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:02,410
Captain. Captain.
Please. Please leave--

306
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:13,920
There's a $70 bonus

307
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,930
from the Rocky Mountain Fur
Company to the two men...

308
00:38:16,930 --> 00:38:18,930
...that stay with Glass
to see this through.

309
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:19,850
I'll stay!

310
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:22,430
Me, too.
Money or not, I'll stay.

311
00:38:23,930 --> 00:38:25,430
I'll need a third.

312
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:26,940
Sorry, Captain.

313
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:30,940
I have a family.
I'm not crazy.

314
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:33,940
Captain, three men
can't hold off
a party of Ree,

315
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:35,950
much less some boys.

316
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:38,950
Besides, $70 ain't
gonna buy nobody
a new set of ears.

317
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:40,950
A hundred, then.

318
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:43,950
This man is the only reason
we're still alive.

319
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:46,460
We were 45 men
when this started.

320
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:48,460
Now we're ten.
Almost nine.

321
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:50,460
He's my father.
He can have my share.

322
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:52,960
Mine, too.
He can have my share also.

323
00:38:57,470 --> 00:38:59,470
All right.

324
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:00,970
If Mr. Bridger
feels the same way,

325
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:02,470
I'll lag behind with them.

326
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:03,970
You?
            Yep.

327
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:05,980
You already lost
my share of the pelts...

328
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:09,980
...so I got no choice
but to make it up
by some other means.

329
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:12,980
Sticking around
for another day or two
don't make no difference.

330
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:15,480
$300...at least I get to
go home with something.

331
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:19,000
Glass is to be cared
for until, understood?

332
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:21,490
Yeah. You have my word.
I understand.

333
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:24,490
You boys get him
down off this slope

334
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,510
and somewhere safe
before dark.

335
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:28,500
Fitzgerald.

336
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,500
Glass is to be cared for
as long as necessary.

337
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,500
And a proper burial
when it's time.

338
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:37,020
He's earned it.

339
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:39,010
I understand.

340
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:44,510
You hurt yourself?

341
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,530
I'll be fine.

342
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:33,600
<i>Three hundred bucks</i>

343
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,520
<i>goes a long way
toward retirement.</i>

344
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:38,520
<i>Go down to Texas, find me
a decent piece of land,</i>

345
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,990
<i>and start pissing
in the wind.</i>

346
00:42:41,490 --> 00:42:44,490
Get me the hell out of this
godforsaken place.

347
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:50,630
Ree done that to you?

348
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:53,620
I'm just asking.

349
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:56,620
Yeah, they done it.

350
00:42:57,120 --> 00:43:00,630
They took their sweet time
with it.

351
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:01,630
At the start,
I didn't feel nothing.

352
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:03,630
I just heard the sound...

353
00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:07,630
...of the knife scraping
against my skull and...

354
00:43:07,630 --> 00:43:09,130
...them all laughing
and whooping

355
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:11,650
and hollering and whatnot.

356
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:13,140
Then the blood came.

357
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:16,140
It was cold. It started
streaming down my face,

358
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:17,640
in my eyes, and...

359
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:19,650
...breathing it in.

360
00:43:19,650 --> 00:43:21,650
Choking on it.

361
00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:24,650
That's when I felt it.

362
00:43:25,650 --> 00:43:28,150
Yeah, felt all of it.

363
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:30,670
I got my head turned
inside out.

364
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:32,660
Jesus.

365
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:35,160
Them Indians
down Texas way...

366
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:38,160
...they may rob you,
but they ain't gonna
take your topknot.

367
00:43:39,170 --> 00:43:40,680
When was it?

368
00:43:44,170 --> 00:43:48,170
Goddamn it, will you quit
that noise now, will you?

369
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:50,690
Quit it.

370
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:17,700
<i>I'm falling further back</i>

371
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:20,040
<i>from Henry and the boys
on account of tending to you.</i>

372
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:25,880
Got to get up
the damn mountain,

373
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:28,380
but winter keeps
chasing us down.

374
00:44:31,390 --> 00:44:33,900
If you ready
to take the sacrament...

375
00:44:35,890 --> 00:44:37,390
...I can do that for you.

376
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:44,900
What you holding to, Glass?

377
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:49,400
You know...

378
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:51,900
...it would be better...

379
00:44:52,410 --> 00:44:55,420
...if you were to take that
last breath of yours now...

380
00:44:55,410 --> 00:44:56,910
for all of us.

381
00:44:59,410 --> 00:45:01,910
Now you hung tough.

382
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,430
And that's something.

383
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:05,920
I'm begging you.

384
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:07,920
Them Ree are so close
I can smell 'em.

385
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,920
You can smell 'em, too.

386
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:12,930
You got to think of your boy.
All right?

387
00:45:12,930 --> 00:45:14,930
'Cause you're gonna kill him.

388
00:45:14,930 --> 00:45:16,430
You'll kill us all.

389
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:25,940
I can muzzle you if you like.

390
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:28,440
Take away this suffering
quick and easy.

391
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:30,940
No one ever has to know
that you give up.

392
00:45:32,450 --> 00:45:35,960
All you have to do is blink
if you want me to do that.

393
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:43,970
Save your boy and blink.

394
00:45:53,970 --> 00:45:55,970
You just have to blink.

395
00:46:00,970 --> 00:46:03,480
Yeah. There it is.

396
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:05,480
You'd best hope
the good Lord'll

397
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:07,480
get His ass here quick, huh?

398
00:46:11,490 --> 00:46:14,000
Maybe He'll forgive
your sins, maybe not.

399
00:46:13,990 --> 00:46:15,990
Thus I do commend thee
to the Lord.

400
00:46:17,490 --> 00:46:21,990
Through Jesus Christ the Lord
of all reality and mercy...

401
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,510
...and the Father
and the Creator,
I hold thee--

402
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:28,000
Get away! Get away!

403
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,470
You okay? Jim! Jim! Help!

404
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:45,020
Help!
Calm down.

405
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:47,020
Jim! Help!

406
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:49,520
Don't shout!
You're gonna get
us all killed!

407
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:52,020
Keep away! I'll tell
the Captain what you did.

408
00:46:52,530 --> 00:46:53,540
They'll hang you!

409
00:46:53,530 --> 00:46:56,530
They'll hang you!
Jim, help!

410
00:46:56,530 --> 00:46:58,530
We have an understanding.

411
00:47:01,450 --> 00:47:04,090
What's fucking wrong
with you people?

412
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:16,060
Shit.

413
00:48:17,190 --> 00:48:19,190
I got one beaver, Hawk.

414
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:22,700
Breathing changed?

415
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:26,200
I hadn't noticed.

416
00:48:27,590 --> 00:48:29,590
Damn, he's cold as ice.

417
00:48:31,090 --> 00:48:33,090
Here you go, Mr. Glass.

418
00:48:33,090 --> 00:48:35,590
This will help you.
Keep you warm.

419
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:38,600
It's all right.

420
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:41,600
Where's Hawk?

421
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:44,600
He ain't with you?

422
00:48:45,610 --> 00:48:46,620
No.

423
00:48:46,610 --> 00:48:48,110
No?

424
00:48:53,110 --> 00:48:55,110
I understand, Mr. Glass.

425
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:58,630
It's all right.
I think I'll get
a fire going.

426
00:48:58,620 --> 00:49:01,120
Yeah.
Sounds like a good idea.

427
00:49:07,630 --> 00:49:08,630
Hawk!

428
00:49:12,170 --> 00:49:13,260
<i>Hawk!</i>

429
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:36,610
Shh. Ree.

430
00:49:36,610 --> 00:49:39,610
There's about 20 of them
down by the creek.

431
00:49:39,610 --> 00:49:43,610
They're headed this way.
Grab your shit and let's go.

432
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:47,620
Shit. What do we do?

433
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:49,620
Run, right now.

434
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:51,120
What about Hawk?

435
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:53,120
He ain't our problem
no more.

436
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:54,620
We can't just leave him.

437
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:56,120
Either he's gutted
or scalped.

438
00:49:56,130 --> 00:49:59,140
And if he ain't
he can find us, can't he?

439
00:49:59,130 --> 00:50:00,600
What about Glass?

440
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:03,630
He ain't our problem.
Like us, he's on his own.

441
00:50:03,630 --> 00:50:05,630
We made a promise
to the Captain.

442
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:07,650
A proper burial
when the time was needed.

443
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:09,640
He needs that rifle!

444
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:13,640
He couldn't do nothing
with it if you tarred it
to his hand.

445
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:15,640
We can't do this.

446
00:50:15,650 --> 00:50:17,160
We got no fucking choice.

447
00:50:17,150 --> 00:50:19,150
No, we can't.
Look at him.

448
00:50:21,650 --> 00:50:23,620
All right, shit,
then, buddy.
Get him up.

449
00:50:24,150 --> 00:50:25,150
You want to take him?

450
00:50:28,660 --> 00:50:29,570
Come on now!

451
00:50:30,130 --> 00:50:32,660
Easy. Slowly, Fitz.
Easy with him.

452
00:50:35,170 --> 00:50:36,680
Just get your shit.

453
00:50:36,670 --> 00:50:38,170
Get your shit!

454
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:40,640
Shut up.

455
00:50:44,670 --> 00:50:45,670
Shut up!

456
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:47,680
Hold up!

457
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:52,180
Fitz. What are you doing?

458
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:54,180
What does it look like?

459
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:56,690
Proper burial.
Like you wanted.

460
00:50:56,690 --> 00:50:58,690
No, not like this.

461
00:50:58,690 --> 00:51:00,660
Why not?

462
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:03,160
He's alive, Fitz.
He's alive.

463
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:06,710
So shoot him.

464
00:51:19,710 --> 00:51:21,710
I have to go. I have to go.

465
00:51:22,710 --> 00:51:25,710
I'm sorry, Mr. Glass.
I'm sorry.

466
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:28,230
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
-

467
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:44,370
Captain! This way!

468
00:51:45,370 --> 00:51:47,370
There's a path down here!

469
00:51:49,370 --> 00:51:51,370
There ain't shit down there!

470
00:51:51,370 --> 00:51:52,820
We got to climb over!

471
00:51:52,830 --> 00:51:54,390
Glass said to stay east!

472
00:51:54,380 --> 00:51:56,880
Glass can go to hell!

473
00:51:57,380 --> 00:51:58,880
What's the map say?

474
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:01,380
Keep climbing.
We climb, Captain.

475
00:52:01,890 --> 00:52:02,890
We keep climbing.

476
00:52:02,890 --> 00:52:04,900
Till we reach Old Gabe.

477
00:52:08,890 --> 00:52:10,390
We climb.

478
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:15,410
We got to wait for Murph.
       Yeah. You wait for him.

479
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:17,900
Captain?

480
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:21,400
Sir...

481
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:24,410
...Murphy says there's
a way down there.

482
00:52:24,410 --> 00:52:25,910
Who we following?

483
00:52:25,910 --> 00:52:27,410
You follow who you want!

484
00:52:27,910 --> 00:52:29,410
I'm going up!

485
00:52:30,410 --> 00:52:31,910
Stubby, keep going up!

486
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:33,930
Murph! Come here!

487
00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:12,440
Fire's done.

488
00:57:13,450 --> 00:57:15,450
I can't even feel my feet.

489
00:57:17,450 --> 00:57:20,450
Didn't we put enough distance
between us and them Ree?

490
00:57:20,950 --> 00:57:23,460
A dozen Ree can make twice
as good time as we can.

491
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:24,960
Twenty.
What?

492
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:29,460
You said you saw
twenty Ree.

493
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:31,460
Yeah? What you talking about?

494
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:37,470
You woke me up.
Mmm-hmm.

495
00:57:37,470 --> 00:57:39,970
You said you saw
twenty Ree by the creek.

496
00:57:39,970 --> 00:57:42,970
Well, yeah, twenty,
a dozen, it don't matter.

497
00:57:42,980 --> 00:57:46,490
I wasn't gonna hang around
counting fucking feathers.

498
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:50,980
As a matter of fact...

499
00:57:52,990 --> 00:57:56,500
...what was you doing
down by the creek
all by yourself?

500
00:57:56,490 --> 00:57:58,490
I'd already brought up
plenty of water.

501
00:58:00,490 --> 00:58:02,490
Hey!

502
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:06,010
Answer me, Fitzgerald.
I asked you a question.

503
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:09,000
Don't question me
on account of
you feel guilty.

504
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,500
Answer me or I'll
blow your head off.

505
00:58:12,010 --> 00:58:14,520
You got
a short-term memory, boy.

506
00:58:14,510 --> 00:58:18,510
Your ass would be floating
around the Missouri right now
if it wasn't for me.

507
00:58:20,510 --> 00:58:22,510
You want to ask questions?

508
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:25,030
What you want to ask?
If you want to know, ask it.

509
00:58:25,020 --> 00:58:26,520
Hmm?

510
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:28,020
You want to know
why you left

511
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:30,020
Mr. Glass back there
for dead, huh?

512
00:58:30,020 --> 00:58:33,530
Or why you left your little
boyfriend running around?

513
00:58:33,530 --> 00:58:36,530
You want to know
if he's still alive?

514
00:58:36,530 --> 00:58:39,030
I'll tell you why.
It's 'cause you ain't
a man yet.

515
00:58:39,030 --> 00:58:41,530
It's 'cause you was
scared shitless.

516
00:58:41,530 --> 00:58:43,030
You're scared now.

517
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:44,000
The Ree.

518
00:58:44,540 --> 00:58:45,490
What of them?

519
00:58:46,540 --> 00:58:48,040
Tell me, did you see 'em?

520
00:58:48,540 --> 00:58:49,460
Put your rifle down.

521
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:50,830
Did you see the Ree?

522
00:58:52,830 --> 00:58:53,800
No.

523
00:58:55,330 --> 00:58:57,330
Not a single one.

524
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:02,850
You fucking lied to me?
You lied to me!

525
00:59:07,340 --> 00:59:09,810
I had to scare some
sense into you, boy.

526
00:59:09,810 --> 00:59:12,350
Glass was dead.
Hawk we don't know about.

527
00:59:12,350 --> 00:59:15,350
No point in either
of us dying either,
you understand?

528
00:59:15,350 --> 00:59:17,850
The way I see it,
I saved your life twice now.

529
00:59:17,850 --> 00:59:20,360
I ought to be God to you.

530
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:23,860
And God giveth...
and God taketh away.

531
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:28,360
...

532
00:59:31,370 --> 00:59:32,870
Lucky fucker.

533
00:59:33,870 --> 00:59:37,370
Next time you want to
shoot somebody...

534
00:59:37,370 --> 00:59:38,870
...you might
want to use powder,

535
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:40,890
prime your rifle.

536
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:47,380
Come on. Let's git.
Grab your shit.

537
01:14:27,100 --> 01:14:28,610
Who did this?

538
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:29,600
I don't know.

539
01:14:37,610 --> 01:14:40,120
Could be Captain
Leavenworth's boys.

540
01:14:41,610 --> 01:14:43,110
Mmm. Yeah.

541
01:14:44,610 --> 01:14:47,610
Put some eyes on the back
of your head.

542
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:53,620
These Injuns ain't never
as dead as you think they are.

543
01:14:54,120 --> 01:14:55,620
Look at 'em, huh?

544
01:14:55,620 --> 01:14:58,130
They're always
stealing our shit.

545
01:15:34,250 --> 01:15:36,760
We got horses over here!

546
01:15:40,750 --> 01:15:42,250
Hey, Bridger.

547
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:49,260
We got horses!

548
01:15:54,770 --> 01:15:57,270
What you want to do
about these pigs?

549
01:16:03,780 --> 01:16:06,790
The Lord's on our side, kid.

550
01:16:14,500 --> 01:16:16,500
You all right there, kid?

551
01:16:16,510 --> 01:16:19,220
Your head in the right place?

552
01:16:19,210 --> 01:16:20,290
I guess.

553
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:28,270
I can't help thinking about
whether we did the right--

554
01:16:28,770 --> 01:16:30,270
Ain't our place to wonder.

555
01:16:30,270 --> 01:16:33,770
The good Lord got us
on a road whether
we choose it or not.

556
01:16:37,730 --> 01:16:40,740
My pop, he weren't
a religious man, you know?

557
01:16:40,730 --> 01:16:42,730
If you couldn't grow it,
kill it, or eat it,

558
01:16:43,230 --> 01:16:46,730
he just plain old
didn't believe in it.

559
01:16:46,740 --> 01:16:50,210
And this one time he head on
up the old Saba hills.

560
01:16:50,210 --> 01:16:52,220
San Saba hills?

561
01:16:52,740 --> 01:16:56,240
He joined a couple Texas
Ranger buddies of his to hunt.

562
01:16:56,750 --> 01:16:59,720
Pretty routine. He done it
like a hundred times before.

563
01:16:59,710 --> 01:17:02,750
Should have been a 3-day kill,
but on the second day,

564
01:17:02,750 --> 01:17:05,250
it all went fucked.

565
01:17:05,250 --> 01:17:07,750
Somehow that night
he lost his buddies.

566
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:09,270
And to top it off...

567
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:12,810
...them Comanches went
and took the horses.

568
01:17:12,810 --> 01:17:15,310
So he was starving
and delirious...

569
01:17:15,310 --> 01:17:19,320
...and he crawls up
into this mott, this...

570
01:17:19,320 --> 01:17:21,770
...group of trees out
in the middle of nowhere

571
01:17:21,770 --> 01:17:24,320
just sticking up
in this ocean of scrub...

572
01:17:24,820 --> 01:17:26,820
...and he found religion.

573
01:17:27,780 --> 01:17:30,750
At that moment, he told me...

574
01:17:30,750 --> 01:17:32,840
...he found God.

575
01:17:34,830 --> 01:17:35,750
Uh-huh.

576
01:17:39,290 --> 01:17:42,340
And it turns out that God...

577
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:45,340
...He's a squirrel.

578
01:17:46,290 --> 01:17:48,850
Yeah. A big, old meaty one.

579
01:17:51,850 --> 01:17:55,270
"I found God," he used to say.

580
01:17:55,270 --> 01:17:58,360
"And while sitting there
and basking in the glory

581
01:17:58,360 --> 01:18:00,310
"and sublimity of mercy..."

582
01:18:01,860 --> 01:18:04,360
"...I shot and ate
that son of a bitch."

583
01:18:13,820 --> 01:18:14,820
Mmm.

584
01:18:16,830 --> 01:18:20,300
Yeah. You might want to
close your eyes, kid.

585
01:27:18,450 --> 01:27:19,950
Grizzly.

586
01:27:22,950 --> 01:27:24,450
Grizzly.

587
01:30:00,030 --> 01:30:03,030
Yeah!
There she is.

588
01:30:04,530 --> 01:30:07,030
We did it.

589
01:30:07,030 --> 01:30:09,540
You ought to be
proud of yourself, boy.

590
01:30:10,540 --> 01:30:11,540
Yeah.

591
01:30:11,540 --> 01:30:12,540
We followed orders.

592
01:30:12,540 --> 01:30:15,040
We just skipped
the funeral part.

593
01:30:15,540 --> 01:30:18,540
Don't go down there and
start growing no conscience.

594
01:30:18,550 --> 01:30:20,060
'Cause sure as night'll come

595
01:30:20,050 --> 01:30:23,050
they'll have us swinging
from a couple ropes.

596
01:30:23,050 --> 01:30:25,020
We did what we had to do.

597
01:30:53,300 --> 01:30:55,750
<i>We had the extra
day so we managed to dig...</i>

598
01:30:55,750 --> 01:30:57,330
...a little deeper,
lay rocks on top

599
01:30:57,340 --> 01:30:59,010
so scavengers
couldn't get at him.

600
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:02,560
It was done right and all.
He was buried right.

601
01:31:03,640 --> 01:31:05,140
Sir, can we--

602
01:31:05,140 --> 01:31:07,640
The truth is that...

603
01:31:07,650 --> 01:31:10,660
...when Hawk disappeared,
I was worried about savages.

604
01:31:10,650 --> 01:31:14,650
And I was ready to get,
to move on out.

605
01:31:14,650 --> 01:31:18,650
Yeah, but, Bridger here
argued to stay.

606
01:31:19,160 --> 01:31:21,160
He argued to stay...

607
01:31:21,160 --> 01:31:24,660
...so he could at least
build a cross or something...

608
01:31:24,660 --> 01:31:26,160
...to put on top
of Glass's grave,

609
01:31:26,660 --> 01:31:29,670
and that's what he did.
That's what we did.

610
01:31:29,670 --> 01:31:32,170
I'm glad you pulled
your weight, Mr. Bridger.

611
01:31:32,170 --> 01:31:33,670
He more than pulled
his weight, Captain.

612
01:31:33,670 --> 01:31:36,670
This man here,
he was my partner.

613
01:31:42,180 --> 01:31:46,180
Am I to assume that
the agreed arrangement
did not change?

614
01:31:46,180 --> 01:31:49,190
Uh, fortunately for me,
it did not.

615
01:31:49,190 --> 01:31:50,190
Mmm-hmm.

616
01:32:11,380 --> 01:32:12,920
Thank you...

617
01:32:12,910 --> 01:32:17,000
...for your courage,
honor, and service.

618
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:19,970
Deal or no deal,
Mr. Bridger,

619
01:32:19,970 --> 01:32:22,220
you deserve something
for what you did.

620
01:32:22,220 --> 01:32:23,720
Thank you.

621
01:32:33,810 --> 01:32:38,230
Kid's been beating himself up
awful bad the whole trip.

622
01:32:41,160 --> 01:32:43,250
We all saw
the shape Glass was in.

623
01:32:43,240 --> 01:32:45,740
There was no more
to be done. Right?

624
01:32:46,240 --> 01:32:46,990
Yeah.

625
01:32:48,780 --> 01:32:50,160
We all saw him.

626
01:44:21,520 --> 01:44:23,020
Shh...

627
01:44:25,030 --> 01:44:26,490
Don't make a sound.

628
01:46:06,660 --> 01:46:08,540
- May I join you?
- Yes.

629
01:46:08,550 --> 01:46:11,140
Yeah?
Yes.

630
01:46:11,130 --> 01:46:14,830
I was wondering when
we might be getting
paid for that haul.

631
01:46:14,830 --> 01:46:16,840
'Cause them pelts
we collected

632
01:46:17,340 --> 01:46:19,340
are still out there,
you know...

633
01:46:19,340 --> 01:46:21,810
...under a couple foot
of dirt and snow.

634
01:46:21,810 --> 01:46:23,340
But that ain't my fault.

635
01:46:23,840 --> 01:46:26,850
I'm waiting for
Captain Leavenworth
to arrive with his army.

636
01:46:27,350 --> 01:46:28,850
Then we'll have
enough men...

637
01:46:28,850 --> 01:46:32,350
...to shoot some civilization
into those fucking Arikara

638
01:46:32,350 --> 01:46:33,850
and get back our pelts.

639
01:46:33,850 --> 01:46:36,860
All right. All right.

640
01:46:36,860 --> 01:46:39,360
When's that supposed
to happen?

641
01:46:39,360 --> 01:46:40,860
I don't know.

642
01:46:40,860 --> 01:46:43,360
But until then,
nobody gets paid.

643
01:46:45,870 --> 01:46:47,840
Listen here, all right?

644
01:46:47,830 --> 01:46:51,870
I was hired to trap 'em.
I wasn't hired to guard 'em.

645
01:46:51,870 --> 01:46:56,630
The way I see it,
now you, you got a safe.

646
01:46:56,630 --> 01:46:58,210
It's probably
full of money.

647
01:46:58,710 --> 01:47:01,210
You signed a contract
to protect your boss

648
01:47:01,210 --> 01:47:04,220
and your boss's property.

649
01:47:04,220 --> 01:47:05,720
And that safe
isn't full anymore.

650
01:47:05,720 --> 01:47:08,220
It's short about $300.

651
01:47:08,220 --> 01:47:11,220
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

652
01:47:11,220 --> 01:47:13,230
It means,
according to my records...

653
01:47:13,230 --> 01:47:15,230
...you purchased more goods
on the expedition

654
01:47:15,230 --> 01:47:18,230
than what you are
owed by the company.

655
01:47:22,240 --> 01:47:24,750
Now, Happy New Year,
Fitzgerald.

656
01:56:30,700 --> 01:56:33,700
Fryman!
White man at the gate!

657
01:56:46,430 --> 01:56:47,930
Speak English.

658
01:56:47,930 --> 01:56:49,930
I have no weapon.

659
01:56:49,940 --> 01:56:51,950
Open her up!

660
01:56:51,940 --> 01:56:53,440
Get the Captain!

661
01:56:53,440 --> 01:56:54,720
<i>Where are your men?</i>

662
01:56:55,810 --> 01:56:57,560
All dead.

663
01:56:57,560 --> 01:56:58,860
Who was he?

664
01:56:58,860 --> 01:57:01,360
I don't know.
Something to eat, please?

665
01:57:01,360 --> 01:57:03,360
Food comes at a price.

666
01:57:04,370 --> 01:57:05,370
I have no money.

667
01:57:05,370 --> 01:57:07,370
Then you don't eat.

668
01:57:07,370 --> 01:57:09,870
Give back some of them
stolen pelts you buy
from the Injuns.

669
01:57:09,870 --> 01:57:11,870
Not now, Jones.
                    Huh?

670
01:57:11,870 --> 01:57:13,880
Silver. How is this? Silver.

671
01:57:16,880 --> 01:57:18,380
This all you got?

672
01:57:20,380 --> 01:57:22,380
We was nine.

673
01:57:22,390 --> 01:57:25,400
My friend,
he die in the snow.

674
01:57:25,390 --> 01:57:27,890
And the other was...

675
01:57:27,890 --> 01:57:29,890
...kill by wolf.
I see it.

676
01:57:29,890 --> 01:57:32,390
By wolf, yeah, kill.

677
01:57:32,400 --> 01:57:34,910
Where'd you get this?

678
01:57:34,900 --> 01:57:36,400
Canteen.

679
01:57:36,400 --> 01:57:39,400
He drop it.
He kill Toussaint,
he drop it--

680
01:57:39,400 --> 01:57:41,400
Who? Who?

681
01:57:41,400 --> 01:57:43,400
I don't know.
I don't see.

682
01:57:44,410 --> 01:57:45,860
It could be Hawk.

683
01:57:48,440 --> 01:57:49,940
Yeah, could be.

684
01:57:49,950 --> 01:57:51,960
That half-breed runt
couldn't steal no horse.

685
01:57:51,950 --> 01:57:53,780
-      Maybe it was Weston.
- Or Beckett.

686
01:57:54,030 --> 01:57:55,120
How far from here?

687
01:57:55,120 --> 01:57:56,620
Thirty mile.

688
01:57:56,620 --> 01:57:58,620
Northwest,
near the Yellowstone.

689
01:57:58,620 --> 01:58:00,120
The Yellowstone!

690
01:58:00,120 --> 01:58:02,620
Get the horses saddled.
Torches and supplies.

691
01:58:02,630 --> 01:58:04,640
Ten dollars a man.

692
01:58:04,630 --> 01:58:06,090
Anderson, you stay here.

693
01:58:06,100 --> 01:58:09,140
Yes, sir.
Feed him and watch him.

694
01:58:10,630 --> 01:58:12,130
I'll get you a drink.

695
01:58:27,780 --> 01:58:29,400
When we get to
the Yellowstone,

696
01:58:29,400 --> 01:58:30,990
we split into two groups!

697
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:44,500
Hawk!

698
01:58:44,500 --> 01:58:46,470
Hawk, you out there?

699
01:58:53,810 --> 01:58:55,890
Whoa! Whoa!

700
01:59:03,400 --> 01:59:04,990
Keep your guard up!

701
01:59:07,070 --> 01:59:08,520
Eyes in front!

702
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:21,500
Who are you?

703
01:59:21,500 --> 01:59:23,500
Beckett? Is that you?

704
01:59:35,520 --> 01:59:36,470
Glass?

705
01:59:37,850 --> 01:59:38,850
Glass!

706
01:59:39,440 --> 01:59:40,940
Jesus Christ!

707
01:59:40,940 --> 01:59:42,940
Jesus Christ,
what happened?

708
01:59:43,440 --> 01:59:44,940
Where is he?

709
01:59:47,950 --> 01:59:50,950
Jones, take him. Go.

710
01:59:50,950 --> 01:59:53,900
I'm riding ahead.
Bill, take Bridger.

711
01:59:54,900 --> 01:59:56,400
Take Bridger!

712
02:00:10,500 --> 02:00:11,500
Have you seen Fitzgerald?

713
02:00:11,500 --> 02:00:12,500
No, sir.

714
02:00:18,840 --> 02:00:20,810
Get up. Get up!

715
02:00:20,810 --> 02:00:22,850
You seen Fitzgerald?
                   No, sir.

716
02:00:22,850 --> 02:00:23,810
Fitzgerald?

717
02:00:33,830 --> 02:00:35,290
Whoa, easy.

718
02:00:35,280 --> 02:00:36,830
Where did he go?

719
02:00:37,330 --> 02:00:38,830
Who?

720
02:00:38,830 --> 02:00:40,330
Fitzgerald.
Where did he go?

721
02:00:40,330 --> 02:00:41,830
I have no idea.

722
02:00:41,830 --> 02:00:43,330
Tell me or
I'll take your head off.

723
02:00:43,340 --> 02:00:44,850
I swear to God--

724
02:00:45,840 --> 02:00:47,340
Tell me. Tell me!

725
02:00:47,340 --> 02:00:48,840
Texas!

726
02:00:48,840 --> 02:00:50,840
He said he was
going to Texas.

727
02:00:50,840 --> 02:00:52,840
He said he was
gonna reenlist.

728
02:00:52,850 --> 02:00:54,860
Then he started
talking about property.

729
02:00:54,850 --> 02:00:56,350
"A decent piece of land."

730
02:00:56,850 --> 02:00:58,850
He's heading for Texas.
That's all I know.

731
02:00:59,350 --> 02:01:00,350
Stay here.

732
02:01:03,720 --> 02:01:05,310
Fitzgerald!

733
02:01:06,810 --> 02:01:07,810
Fitzgerald!

734
02:01:36,560 --> 02:01:38,020
Goddamn it!

735
02:01:41,060 --> 02:01:43,060
Goddamn it!

736
02:01:43,060 --> 02:01:46,060
Jones!
Get the Captain!

737
02:01:46,070 --> 02:01:47,070
Fryman!

738
02:01:47,070 --> 02:01:48,530
Open the gate!

739
02:01:48,520 --> 02:01:50,070
Open it up!

740
02:01:52,070 --> 02:01:53,520
Murphy,
get the Captain.

741
02:02:00,030 --> 02:02:03,530
Get him to the doctor. Now!

742
02:02:04,030 --> 02:02:07,030
You said he was dead!
You said he was dead!

743
02:02:07,540 --> 02:02:08,540
I thought he was, I swear!

744
02:02:10,540 --> 02:02:12,040
He lied to me!

745
02:02:12,040 --> 02:02:13,370
You're a liar.

746
02:02:13,590 --> 02:02:16,180
You left him out there!

747
02:02:17,130 --> 02:02:19,180
Say the Lord's Prayer.

748
02:02:19,180 --> 02:02:21,180
Say the Lord's Prayer!

749
02:02:22,180 --> 02:02:24,690
Our Father,
Who art in heaven.

750
02:02:24,690 --> 02:02:26,690
Who art--
I can't!

751
02:02:27,190 --> 02:02:28,690
Shut up! Shut up!

752
02:02:28,690 --> 02:02:30,190
From here out,

753
02:02:30,190 --> 02:02:31,690
you're a prisoner
charged with treason!

754
02:02:31,690 --> 02:02:34,200
Take him to the cage!
Take him to the cage

755
02:02:34,700 --> 02:02:36,700
or you'll hang
alongside him!

756
02:02:36,700 --> 02:02:38,620
I thought he was gonna die!

757
02:02:40,040 --> 02:02:41,880
Fitz lied to me!

758
02:02:42,710 --> 02:02:44,130
I couldn't help him!

759
02:02:48,240 --> 02:02:49,240
Glass!

760
02:02:49,250 --> 02:02:51,090
Fitz lied to me!

761
02:03:21,490 --> 02:03:22,490
How is he?

762
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:24,510
He'll be fine,
but there is swelling.

763
02:03:24,500 --> 02:03:25,500
He needs to rest.

764
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,000
I'll be back
to check up on him.

765
02:03:37,510 --> 02:03:39,010
He ran off, didn't he?

766
02:03:48,050 --> 02:03:50,050
Bridger's telling the truth.

767
02:03:52,060 --> 02:03:53,970
How's that?

768
02:03:53,980 --> 02:03:58,070
Fitzgerald lied to him.
He was just following orders.

769
02:03:59,570 --> 02:04:03,080
He wasn't there when
Fitzgerald stabbed
my boy to death.

770
02:04:07,660 --> 02:04:09,660
Is that what happened?

771
02:04:11,330 --> 02:04:13,290
He killed Hawk.

772
02:04:17,250 --> 02:04:18,830
I need a horse and gun.

773
02:04:18,830 --> 02:04:22,340
No, you need
to rest and eat.
I'm going after him.

774
02:04:22,340 --> 02:04:24,840
No.

775
02:04:24,840 --> 02:04:26,840
You'll never find him
without me.

776
02:04:26,840 --> 02:04:29,840
If we wait till morning
he'll get away.

777
02:04:29,850 --> 02:04:31,360
No, he won't.

778
02:04:32,350 --> 02:04:33,850
He's afraid.

779
02:04:35,350 --> 02:04:38,320
He knows how far
I came for him.

780
02:04:39,360 --> 02:04:40,870
Same as that elk.

781
02:04:40,860 --> 02:04:44,360
When they get afraid,
they run deep into the woods.

782
02:04:44,360 --> 02:04:48,830
I got him trapped.
He just doesn't know it yet.

783
02:04:48,830 --> 02:04:51,420
How can you be so sure?

784
02:04:51,420 --> 02:04:54,420
'Cause he has
everything to lose.

785
02:04:56,370 --> 02:04:58,960
All I had was that boy.

786
02:04:59,960 --> 02:05:02,460
And he took him away from me.

787
02:05:05,460 --> 02:05:07,970
I can't let you
go back out there.

788
02:05:07,970 --> 02:05:09,470
Not again.

789
02:05:12,970 --> 02:05:15,470
I ain't afraid to die anymore.

790
02:05:17,480 --> 02:05:19,490
I done it already.

791
02:05:24,980 --> 02:05:26,980
I'm going with you.

792
02:06:42,360 --> 02:06:44,360
That's his horse,
all right.

793
02:06:46,950 --> 02:06:49,450
No way he could've ridden him
through the night.

794
02:06:49,950 --> 02:06:51,950
How far ahead?

795
02:06:51,950 --> 02:06:54,460
Half a day at the most.

796
02:06:54,460 --> 02:06:56,460
Could be Ree.

797
02:06:56,460 --> 02:06:58,960
If they aren't his,
we lose him.

798
02:06:59,460 --> 02:07:02,960
Unless he reenlisted
so he could justify
killing again...

799
02:07:03,470 --> 02:07:05,980
...these tracks
right here are his.

800
02:07:15,890 --> 02:07:18,760
<i>I can't remember
my wife's face.</i>

801
02:07:18,760 --> 02:07:21,270
<i>Last week,
she was still with me.</i>

802
02:07:22,770 --> 02:07:24,770
<i>Now she's gone.</i>

803
02:07:27,490 --> 02:07:31,080
I worry I won't recognize her
when I get back home.

804
02:07:43,170 --> 02:07:45,760
Is it true
you killed an officer?

805
02:07:50,210 --> 02:07:53,760
I just killed the man
who was trying to kill my son.

806
02:08:12,570 --> 02:08:13,570
Smoke.

807
02:08:15,070 --> 02:08:16,570
How close?

808
02:08:21,080 --> 02:08:23,580
No more than
a mile up that way.

809
02:08:23,580 --> 02:08:27,080
I'm gonna head up to the west.
You go down to the east.

810
02:08:27,080 --> 02:08:30,580
Let's see if we can
find some tracks.

811
02:08:30,590 --> 02:08:33,100
And if it's the Ree?

812
02:08:33,090 --> 02:08:35,090
If it's the Ree,
you turn right back around

813
02:08:35,090 --> 02:08:37,090
and meet me back here.

814
02:10:05,100 --> 02:10:08,270
Now, I wouldn't expect
to find a man
of your stature...

815
02:10:08,270 --> 02:10:09,770
...so far away from his stove

816
02:10:09,770 --> 02:10:11,520
on a morning
as cold as this, Captain.

817
02:10:11,520 --> 02:10:12,600
You lost?

818
02:10:13,110 --> 02:10:15,620
I'm here to take you back
to Fort Kiowa...

819
02:10:15,610 --> 02:10:18,110
...where you will be
tried for murder.

820
02:10:18,110 --> 02:10:19,610
Is that so?

821
02:10:19,610 --> 02:10:22,750
I ain't crazy
about your plan.

822
02:10:22,750 --> 02:10:24,530
Besides,
I got one of my own.

823
02:17:52,950 --> 02:17:55,450
We had a deal, Glass!

824
02:17:59,120 --> 02:18:01,120
I tried to tell your boy,
all right?

825
02:18:01,620 --> 02:18:04,570
I tried to tell him,
but he wouldn't listen

826
02:18:04,580 --> 02:18:06,170
and he kept on screaming.

827
02:18:06,160 --> 02:18:08,660
He was gonna get
everybody killed.

828
02:18:10,170 --> 02:18:13,180
But you and me...
we had a deal.

829
02:18:15,170 --> 02:18:17,840
You know what
happened out there.

830
02:18:18,340 --> 02:18:21,310
And on my soul,
the Lord...He knows...

831
02:18:21,310 --> 02:18:22,890
...what happened out there.

832
02:18:25,900 --> 02:18:27,400
There was no deal.

833
02:18:30,900 --> 02:18:32,770
You killed my boy.

834
02:18:35,860 --> 02:18:38,360
Well, maybe you should've
raised a man,

835
02:18:38,360 --> 02:18:40,160
instead of some
girlie little bitch.

836
02:18:51,870 --> 02:18:53,370
Goddamn it.

837
02:21:16,650 --> 02:21:20,650
You came all this way
just for your revenge, huh?

838
02:21:23,160 --> 02:21:26,660
Well, you enjoy it, Glass.

839
02:21:26,660 --> 02:21:29,660
'Cause there ain't nothing
gonna bring your boy back.

840
02:21:32,170 --> 02:21:33,670
No, it won't.
