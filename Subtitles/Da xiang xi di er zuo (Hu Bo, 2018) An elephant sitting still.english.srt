1
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:26,840
He told me the other day...

2
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:38,170
... there is an elephant in Manzhouli.

3
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:46,210
It sits there all day long.

4
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,460
Perhaps some people keep
stabbing it with forks.

5
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:06,880
Or maybe it just enjoys sitting there.

6
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,090
I don't know.

7
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:25,630
People gather there,
watching it sitting still.

8
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,420
They feed the elephant food.

9
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:38,000
but it takes no notice.

10
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:52,090
He told me that before.

11
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:57,290
What did he say?

12
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:03,000
You are stepping on my pants.

13
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,090
What did he say?

14
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,000
Same thing.

15
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,210
Give me some water.

16
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:55,399
What's the smell?

17
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,670
Who opened the freaking window?

18
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,899
I'm closing it now.

19
00:03:00,099 --> 00:03:02,899
It's too late!
Now the apartment is stinky!

20
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:05,340
A lousy day starts again!

21
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,819
It's the kitchen window.

22
00:03:45,019 --> 00:03:46,040
What?

23
00:03:46,789 --> 00:03:48,989
The smell comes in
through the kitchen window.

24
00:03:49,189 --> 00:03:51,170
No one cleans the garbage down there.

25
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,439
It's much better than your bedroom!

26
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:56,670
The dumpster smells better
than your nasty room!

27
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:03,489
Where's my gift card?

28
00:04:03,689 --> 00:04:05,170
No idea.

29
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:09,689
You used it the other day.
Where is it now?

30
00:04:09,889 --> 00:04:11,130
Check the cupboard.

31
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:13,939
It's not there.

32
00:04:14,139 --> 00:04:15,670
Well, I don't know.

33
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:17,819
He stole it.

34
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:19,170
I didn't.

35
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:22,939
You gave a 20% off to
customers at the supermarket.

36
00:04:23,139 --> 00:04:25,390
You then spent the kickback
at Internet cafés!

37
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,819
I did not.

38
00:04:27,019 --> 00:04:30,460
What else can you do?
You little piece of crap.

39
00:04:33,259 --> 00:04:35,359
No one wants the same
lecture every morning.

40
00:04:35,559 --> 00:04:37,840
Am I wrong?

41
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:41,609
Go to your Grandma's. You're gross.

42
00:04:41,809 --> 00:04:43,739
I'd have gone there already
if there's heat in her place.

43
00:04:43,939 --> 00:04:45,529
We don't have heat either!

44
00:04:45,729 --> 00:04:50,710
You are stinking this place out!

45
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,630
Get out.

46
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:23,840
Carry the bag.

47
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,170
I'm off.

48
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,570
You're not allowed to burn it here.

49
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,630
Then where?

50
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:44,210
I don't care. Not in this neighborhood!

51
00:05:44,989 --> 00:05:46,739
But these are from the neighborhood.

52
00:05:46,939 --> 00:05:47,890
You deaf?

53
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,630
You can't burn it here!

54
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:52,170
Burn it right here!

55
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:56,210
Who do you think you are?

56
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:00,880
Burn it right here!

57
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,420
Come down here You piece of crap!

58
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:09,899
I'm your Daddy.

59
00:06:10,099 --> 00:06:12,040
Get down here!

60
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:18,840
Get lost.

61
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,880
Till tonight.

62
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:33,290
No way.

63
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,819
Why?

64
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:37,920
I'm leaving for work.

65
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,170
Sometimes when you smoke.

66
00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:00,250
your skin peels off.

67
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:04,340
and blood will remain on the cigarette.

68
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,750
You see?

69
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,170
So?

70
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:21,000
You didn't give me the water I asked.

71
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,630
I have to leave.

72
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:29,170
Suit yourself.

73
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,380
You used the gift card for cigarettes.

74
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:53,390
I didn't.

75
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:56,630
What did you buy then?

76
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:01,630
It's not even yours.
You picked it up on the street.

77
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:01,840
School district housing

78
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:07,170
is triple the price of normal housing.

79
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:11,540
Of course it's not necessary.

80
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,920
But our daughter will go
to a less qualified school.

81
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:20,380
She might be bullied.

82
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:28,630
I can't watch my kid going to the
terrible high school where I'm working.

83
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:34,239
So school district housing is the
only option for a better education.

84
00:09:34,439 --> 00:09:35,390
Your feet.

85
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:41,841
But our money can only afford
a small school district apartment.

86
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:43,029
Keep it tight.

87
00:09:43,229 --> 00:09:45,710
We can't all move in.

88
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,960
There's not enough space.

89
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:58,630
That's why we want to
send you to a nursing home.

90
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:03,420
You always think.

91
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:06,830
we want to abandon you that way.

92
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:08,100
Your instep.

93
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:15,819
Why do I have to stretch in the morning?

94
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:18,939
Frequent training
makes you a good dancer.

95
00:10:19,139 --> 00:10:22,319
They say I'm good enough.

96
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:24,250
You can do better.

97
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,210
What for?

98
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:30,920
Straighten up your back.

99
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:38,565
The school forbids us to
tutor students outside.

100
00:10:38,765 --> 00:10:42,670
My own student told on me once.

101
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,025
Private schools don't
have these restrictions.

102
00:10:48,225 --> 00:10:50,340
But it offers no
welfare guarantee either.

103
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:55,420
It's not an iron bowl in the long run.

104
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:57,000
Hold on.

105
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:01,290
It's possible to transfer

106
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:03,660
to a branch school,

107
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,340
but takes a lot of effort.

108
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:08,609
Our school acquired a private school

109
00:11:08,809 --> 00:11:11,380
and founded this so-called branch school.

110
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:16,460
The pay is good

111
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:21,500
but it sounds less decent.

112
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:25,210
I'm still thinking about it.

113
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:29,010
Shoulder.

114
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:31,529
Good.

115
00:11:31,729 --> 00:11:32,680
Shoulder.

116
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,180
Good.

117
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,040
Good, go on.

118
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:45,670
I can't keep my dog at nursing homes.

119
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,960
I can't go there.

120
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:50,069
OK, I understand.

121
00:11:50,269 --> 00:11:53,189
Let Grandpa help me with the stretching.
He's good at it.

122
00:11:53,389 --> 00:11:54,880
Concentrate.

123
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,420
Dad, please be more considerate.

124
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:05,880
She doesn't even have a
place to do her homework.

125
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:09,630
She can't always write
on your sewing machine.

126
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:13,920
This is my apartment.

127
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:42,340
Dad, please stop.

128
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,239
We didn't mean it that way.

129
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:49,590
This is not the first
time you brought it up.

130
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:52,340
We are not forcing you.

131
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:28,130
I saw your mother.

132
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,250
What happened?

133
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:35,029
He slashed my bicycle tires.

134
00:15:35,229 --> 00:15:36,710
Why did you bring it here?

135
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:41,840
My Dad will beat me up if he knows it.

136
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:52,000
What's your plan?

137
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:55,880
I don't know.

138
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,420
Let's see what he's up to.

139
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:04,670
Buy him a new phone?

140
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,500
Why should I? I didn't take it.

141
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,460
The whole mess will be over.

142
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:19,170
I'm not afraid of him.

143
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,130
I'm equipped.

144
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:26,210
Good for you.

145
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:33,790
I took my Dad's gun.

146
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:36,340
from his curio collection.

147
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:38,220
He thought I didn't know.

148
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:40,320
I found it a couple of years ago.

149
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,290
What are you going to do with it?

150
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:09,000
Wanna try?

151
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:20,460
You got anything?

152
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:32,170
What's that? Fried churrio?

153
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:41,689
My Dad used to interrogate
people with this.

154
00:17:41,889 --> 00:17:44,090
It leaves no marks.

155
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,840
Your bike.

156
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:16,420
Who's that?

157
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:19,420
It's me.

158
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:30,960
I forgot my shoes.

159
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,750
They are in the cabinet.

160
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:54,340
Somebody else is home?

161
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:55,819
No.

162
00:18:56,019 --> 00:18:57,540
Why are you back?

163
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:00,290
I'm picking up my stuff.

164
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,590
Are you leaving?

165
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,300
What?

166
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:09,250
Or are you staying home?

167
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:21,170
Those are your shoes?

168
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:32,040
Yes.

169
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,710
The water is leaking in the toilet!

170
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:44,090
The toilet is leaking!

171
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:10,170
What?

172
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:18,960
The toilet is leaking again.
It's all flooded.

173
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,500
You did it?

174
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:28,170
It's the third time.

175
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:31,420
Call someone to fix it.

176
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:35,130
or use a basin, OK?

177
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:46,380
Your cake is there.

178
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,880
You stepped on it?

179
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:20,790
No.

180
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:26,540
I bought it for you and you crushed it?

181
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:29,090
No, I didn't.

182
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:33,970
I walked two freaking miles.

183
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:39,590
There was no 24-hour bakery store around.

184
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:47,960
I told you I didn't step on it!

185
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:18,460
Where's my contract?

186
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:23,040
Find it and read for me.

187
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:29,380
You hear me?

188
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,460
He wanted to beat up Yu Shuai.

189
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,740
But ended up kneeling down by the river,
singing a lullaby.

190
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:15,109
How did you know?

191
00:29:15,309 --> 00:29:16,710
I was on the other side.

192
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:41,960
Keep rolling.

193
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:49,989
Do you have it on you?

194
00:29:50,189 --> 00:29:51,710
I didn't take it.

195
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,540
Yes.

196
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:57,500
but you stole it.

197
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:01,420
No, I did nothing.

198
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,670
Everyone else's stuff
was right over there.

199
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:14,090
Why were you there?
You don't play basketball.

200
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:19,960
You thought you could fool me?

201
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,920
I didn't steal it. I have my own phone.

202
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,840
What did you see?

203
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:40,750
Stay the hell out of it.

204
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:50,710
He's useless.

205
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:56,689
Why not call you Grandpa.
He practices Tai-chi right?

206
00:30:56,889 --> 00:30:59,000
P...Piss off.

207
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:09,750
I'll come back during the break.

208
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:13,290
Meet me at the stairs.

209
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:16,630
Don't let me come to you.

210
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:19,460
Let's go.

211
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:33,380
I will pay for the broken desk.

212
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:40,040
You were right.
I shouldn't have messed with him.

213
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:43,250
I should've bought him a new one.

214
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:37,670
Here's the money for the desk.

215
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:44,780
Our school is going to be demolished.

216
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,680
What?

217
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:52,710
This is the worst school in town.

218
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:55,739
They are building up a new neighborhood.

219
00:32:55,939 --> 00:32:58,000
Our school is merging with another one.

220
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:02,250
This stupid building will be gone.

221
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:06,855
What about us?

222
00:33:07,055 --> 00:33:08,630
You?

223
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:12,250
You go wherever you're supposed to go.

224
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,989
And you?

225
00:33:19,189 --> 00:33:20,420
Me?

226
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:23,189
I'll have a new office
in the new school.

227
00:33:23,389 --> 00:33:25,630
Larger, more comfortable.

228
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:29,189
You guys will go to the
worst high school in the city.

229
00:33:29,389 --> 00:33:33,250
When you graduate, most of you
will become street food vendors.

230
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:41,790
Keep the money.

231
00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:44,420
Have some fun at the Internet café.

232
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:50,000
Why are you so positive
about your future?

233
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:59,750
Tell that mopping boy to come in.

234
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:17,000
Vice dean asked for you.

235
00:34:21,390 --> 00:34:23,790
The world is a wasteland.

236
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:26,210
What?

237
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:31,085
A quote from this book. I'm moved.

238
00:34:31,285 --> 00:34:33,170
You are... moved?

239
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:49,290
Did you pay for the desk?

240
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,170
For History class?

241
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:56,720
Yep.

242
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:06,170
Why don't you go inside?

243
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:10,750
Wanna stand for a while.

244
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,920
Do you want to meet me
later this afternoon?

245
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:25,850
Where?

246
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:27,340
Monkey park.

247
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,170
I can't. I have other things.

248
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:38,420
What things?

249
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:45,170
You don't have anything to do?
Why always go there?

250
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:51,170
I've got my own business as well.

251
00:36:54,010 --> 00:36:55,840
Like what?

252
00:36:56,890 --> 00:36:58,960
Feeding monkeys?

253
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,880
No.

254
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,040
You shouldn't have messed with Yu Shuai.

255
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:15,790
He has a brother. Everyone knows that.

256
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:17,880
His brother can kill you.

257
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,540
That'd be perfect.

258
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,960
What do you want?

259
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:46,000
I've seen worse. They didn't
force you out of your home yet.

260
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:50,109
I know the place.

261
00:38:50,309 --> 00:38:52,029
I know the place.

262
00:38:52,229 --> 00:38:56,670
Tolerable food, TV sets.

263
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:00,430
But you have to smoke secretly.

264
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:04,710
My old badminton fellow is there.

265
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:09,910
Why ask? You're bored at home?

266
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:12,880
I thought your granddaughter
is close to you.

267
00:39:19,869 --> 00:39:20,819
Mister.

268
00:39:21,019 --> 00:39:24,029
Have you seen a big white dog?

269
00:39:24,229 --> 00:39:26,399
It's white, huge, like this big,
and long hair. Have you seen it?

270
00:39:26,599 --> 00:39:27,239
No.

271
00:39:27,439 --> 00:39:29,069
I saw it.

272
00:39:29,269 --> 00:39:31,439
Running north.

273
00:39:31,639 --> 00:39:32,779
North where?

274
00:39:32,979 --> 00:39:35,340
Towards that bridge.

275
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:40,090
Are you able to look after the kid?

276
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,720
They won't allow me.

277
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:47,710
My hands tremor sometimes.

278
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:52,920
Then you are useless to them.

279
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:58,290
I bet you have to leave anyways.

280
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:03,130
They won't even pay for your
residential fees if they're not happy.

281
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:03,340
The police came.

282
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:12,590
You know what.

283
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:17,340
it wasn't because of me.

284
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:22,840
He bought this apartment

285
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:26,380
because you made him do it.

286
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:31,420
He had a lousy pay.

287
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:43,130
What else can he do with that pay?
So he jumped off the building.

288
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:49,630
I don't care what you think.

289
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:02,670
It was his own decision. I'm not guilty.

290
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:11,340
He was paying for your vanity.

291
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:18,130
You're the one who should've jumped off.

292
00:42:28,390 --> 00:42:31,670
I can't believe I'm
talking to you about this.

293
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:44,319
Did anyone ask about it?

294
00:42:44,519 --> 00:42:45,950
They'd better not ask.

295
00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:49,340
Or I'll tell them it was
you that pushed him off.

296
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:07,210
Why do you look so sad?

297
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:13,130
Because he's dead?

298
00:43:14,970 --> 00:43:17,130
Because I'm heartless?

299
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:23,840
Or all the problems coming up?

300
00:43:31,930 --> 00:43:34,899
They called his Mom.

301
00:43:35,099 --> 00:43:36,609
She has booked a flight.

302
00:43:36,809 --> 00:43:38,670
She will come to you.

303
00:43:39,090 --> 00:43:41,170
You were his only friend.

304
00:43:42,930 --> 00:43:45,000
Understood?

305
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:08,250
You gave him the money?

306
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:12,920
He didn't take it.

307
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:16,250
He said our school is closing.

308
00:44:17,010 --> 00:44:19,130
How come?

309
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:27,040
He said we're going to
be street food vendors.

310
00:44:29,090 --> 00:44:31,840
No. He lied to you.

311
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:38,670
I know.

312
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:42,630
But I think it makes sense.

313
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:48,290
What were you doing with Huang Ling?

314
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:59,130
She said Yu Shuai's
brother could kill us.

315
00:45:19,970 --> 00:45:22,750
You have the balls to come with him?

316
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:29,340
Tell me your thoughts.

317
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:33,210
He didn't steal it.

318
00:45:37,050 --> 00:45:41,340
You were not there.

319
00:45:43,590 --> 00:45:46,920
But I know he's not a thief.

320
00:45:50,430 --> 00:45:53,880
But my phone is missing.

321
00:45:57,300 --> 00:45:59,670
Maybe someone else took it.

322
00:46:06,510 --> 00:46:09,250
Maybe your Dad took it.

323
00:46:12,090 --> 00:46:18,710
What did he take from my
family that got him fired?

324
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:28,670
Did he bribe you?
So you stand up for him?

325
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:35,775
Be careful.
The school might kick you out as well.

326
00:46:35,975 --> 00:46:38,380
So you can stay home with Daddy.

327
00:46:39,590 --> 00:46:41,899
Fine. I'll buy you a new phone.

328
00:46:42,099 --> 00:46:43,840
Buy your ass!

329
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:47,989
What about my old files?

330
00:46:48,189 --> 00:46:50,359
Let him buy one. Give him an out.

331
00:46:50,559 --> 00:46:55,750
Shut up. They asked for it.

332
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:58,880
We did nothing.

333
00:47:04,050 --> 00:47:05,920
How do you want to end this?

334
00:47:14,930 --> 00:47:20,130
You two sing a lullaby on your knees.

335
00:47:21,010 --> 00:47:23,960
Buy me a new phone later.

336
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:27,670
No way.

337
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:37,989
You think you're the boss?

338
00:47:38,189 --> 00:47:39,290
No.

339
00:47:40,090 --> 00:47:42,670
Then stay out of his business.

340
00:47:47,510 --> 00:47:49,340
You are nothing.

341
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:58,340
What are you?

342
00:47:59,510 --> 00:48:02,920
You stupid jackass.

343
00:48:03,970 --> 00:48:09,340
Your mother sells clothes in the
mining area. Everybody knows that.

344
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:17,670
Did I tell you to leave?

345
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:22,739
You wanna fight with that damn stick?

346
00:48:22,939 --> 00:48:25,590
You wanna get yourself killed?

347
00:51:07,090 --> 00:51:08,420
Hey.

348
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:10,340
Who's this?

349
00:51:11,890 --> 00:51:13,130
It's me.

350
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:16,130
You changed your number?

351
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:20,540
No.

352
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:26,040
No. I'll be gone for a while.
You know, some stuff.

353
00:51:26,970 --> 00:51:28,500
Really?

354
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:33,090
What're you doing today?

355
00:51:33,970 --> 00:51:37,460
I have a busy schedule.

356
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:45,170
Fine. Just grab a bite.

357
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:48,880
What's that?

358
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:55,340
I have a call.

359
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:57,029
I can't.

360
00:51:57,229 --> 00:51:59,960
I have a business dinner.

361
00:52:09,590 --> 00:52:12,130
Send me the address. I can wait.

362
00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:19,210
You're annoying.

363
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:23,170
You're right. Life is annoying.

364
00:52:58,590 --> 00:52:59,920
What now?

365
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:02,420
Someone beat up Yu Shuai at school.

366
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:08,090
So? You want me to fight back?

367
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:11,290
Why are you so shameless?

368
00:53:12,430 --> 00:53:15,130
Why?

369
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:18,840
Have you no shame?!

370
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:46,710
Don't go over there! OJ! Come!

371
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:54,460
Go away.

372
00:53:57,640 --> 00:53:58,750
Go away.

373
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:54,880
Have you seen a big white dog?

374
00:55:56,390 --> 00:55:58,090
Like this.

375
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:03,210
Hey, I'm talking to you.

376
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:07,210
Did you hear me?

377
00:56:09,340 --> 00:56:10,779
Watch your ass!

378
00:56:10,979 --> 00:56:12,670
You shitty punk!

379
00:56:27,010 --> 00:56:28,790
I forgot my homework.

380
00:56:51,390 --> 00:56:52,750
Where's my money?

381
00:56:53,550 --> 00:56:55,255
I put it under the mattress.

382
00:56:55,455 --> 00:56:56,545
I don't know.

383
00:56:56,745 --> 00:56:58,325
It was there this morning.

384
00:56:58,525 --> 00:57:00,090
That's not your money.

385
00:57:01,390 --> 00:57:02,710
It's my money.

386
00:57:03,550 --> 00:57:07,590
No, it's not.
Have you earned a single penny?

387
00:57:08,180 --> 00:57:10,540
That's the lucky money from Grandma.

388
00:57:11,930 --> 00:57:12,930
Ugh.

389
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:26,540
Where are you going?

390
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:19,290
(Missing Dog)

391
00:59:30,140 --> 00:59:32,880
Where do they live?

392
00:59:56,090 --> 00:59:59,189
That's enough. Go back inside.

393
00:59:59,389 --> 01:00:02,130
Go back inside.

394
01:00:36,970 --> 01:00:39,750
No one calls the fucking cops!

395
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:47,090
Now tell me about it.

396
01:01:02,340 --> 01:01:04,750
It was scary.

397
01:01:05,510 --> 01:01:07,880
They didn't even wipe off the blood.

398
01:01:14,550 --> 01:01:18,000
They shared the picture in a group chat.

399
01:01:18,340 --> 01:01:20,170
What should we do?

400
01:01:23,050 --> 01:01:25,380
Why're you crying?

401
01:01:26,390 --> 01:01:28,710
I don't know what to do.

402
01:01:32,010 --> 01:01:37,460
It's none of your business.

403
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:51,670
Time for class.

404
01:01:54,340 --> 01:01:56,250
Go back to your seats.

405
01:03:35,220 --> 01:03:37,710
You know what happened?

406
01:03:40,010 --> 01:03:42,540
Not the fighting part.

407
01:03:43,550 --> 01:03:45,630
You two are close?

408
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:49,670
Just fine.

409
01:03:53,430 --> 01:03:57,170
Why did Wei Bu beat up Yu Shuai?

410
01:03:59,590 --> 01:04:02,250
Yu Shuai believed that Li
Kai had stolen his phone.

411
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:04,920
Wei Bu tried to help him out.

412
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:08,790
Can't be that simple.

413
01:04:11,930 --> 01:04:14,250
That's all.

414
01:04:16,050 --> 01:04:21,630
You're asking as if you care.

415
01:04:22,510 --> 01:04:27,710
Because it would get me involved.

416
01:04:28,510 --> 01:04:31,880
The boss would ask me about it.

417
01:04:32,470 --> 01:04:36,290
In the end it's always my business.

418
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:42,880
Students' problems are my problems.

419
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:52,590
If you stay out of it,
nothing will change.

420
01:04:53,430 --> 01:04:54,840
I know.

421
01:04:55,510 --> 01:04:59,590
But I'll get into trouble.

422
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:07,000
Things work like that.

423
01:05:07,390 --> 01:05:10,170
If anything happens,
everyone gets into trouble.

424
01:05:10,970 --> 01:05:14,790
But we keep running into troubles.

425
01:05:20,430 --> 01:05:23,290
We have to close down
the school early today.

426
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:29,290
Last night my Mom...

427
01:05:33,300 --> 01:05:34,710
Mr. Li.

428
01:05:35,180 --> 01:05:42,380
I want Wei Bu's address and phone number.

429
01:06:26,970 --> 01:06:32,250
(Great Circus in Manzhouli)

430
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:07,250
Granny!

431
01:07:10,930 --> 01:07:12,340
Granny!

432
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:19,000
Granny?

433
01:07:20,390 --> 01:07:21,840
Granny?

434
01:12:33,340 --> 01:12:35,250
I'm cooking.

435
01:12:35,970 --> 01:12:39,819
Where's your Mom?

436
01:12:40,019 --> 01:12:41,840
Grandma passed away.

437
01:12:42,300 --> 01:12:45,989
Oh, I didn't know.

438
01:12:46,189 --> 01:12:48,630
Now you know.

439
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:51,630
What do you mean?

440
01:12:53,010 --> 01:12:55,040
Nothing.

441
01:12:56,220 --> 01:12:58,670
You only visit her when you need money.

442
01:12:59,390 --> 01:13:04,710
It's your nephew.

443
01:13:05,510 --> 01:13:06,920
Go and check on your Mom.

444
01:13:07,180 --> 01:13:10,590
You're not going anywhere.

445
01:13:11,260 --> 01:13:14,040
Call his father.

446
01:13:14,890 --> 01:13:16,880
Don't leave.

447
01:15:07,300 --> 01:15:10,359
Who's that?

448
01:15:10,559 --> 01:15:12,290
It's me.

449
01:15:18,760 --> 01:15:20,899
Who are you looking for?

450
01:15:21,099 --> 01:15:24,040
You have a big white dog?

451
01:15:24,590 --> 01:15:26,840
Where is it?

452
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:29,630
It bit my dog.

453
01:15:30,090 --> 01:15:31,899
He saw Pipi?

454
01:15:32,099 --> 01:15:35,450
He said Pipi bit his dog.

455
01:15:35,650 --> 01:15:37,920
But where is Pipi?

456
01:15:38,590 --> 01:15:39,899
It killed my dog

457
01:15:40,099 --> 01:15:42,710
I'm asking about Pipi.

458
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:46,290
Is this your dog?

459
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:49,489
Turn off the gas first.

460
01:15:49,689 --> 01:15:52,540
Ask him about Pipi!

461
01:15:54,260 --> 01:15:56,609
Do you have any proof
that my dog killed yours?

462
01:15:56,809 --> 01:15:58,989
Pipi doesn't bite other dogs.

463
01:15:59,189 --> 01:16:01,000
Shut up.

464
01:16:03,970 --> 01:16:08,000
There was a huge white
dog running in the streets.

465
01:16:10,260 --> 01:16:14,290
But it doesn't have to be my dog.

466
01:16:15,340 --> 01:16:17,670
I have a witness.

467
01:16:17,989 --> 01:16:18,939
Who?

468
01:16:19,139 --> 01:16:24,290
An old lady.
She once saw your wife walking that dog.

469
01:16:28,010 --> 01:16:29,989
I have to find it first.

470
01:16:30,189 --> 01:16:32,500
And confirm what you said.

471
01:16:35,180 --> 01:16:38,170
I went to the vet's.

472
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:41,290
My dog is dead.

473
01:16:47,970 --> 01:16:50,250
How much do you want?

474
01:16:51,220 --> 01:16:55,340
I'm not going to pay the vet's bills.

475
01:16:57,220 --> 01:17:03,130
I'm coming to tell you
that your dog killed mine.

476
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:10,290
What do you want?

477
01:17:12,050 --> 01:17:13,910
How much money do you want?

478
01:17:14,110 --> 01:17:17,069
How much is it worth?

479
01:17:17,269 --> 01:17:19,590
Your dog must have bitten mine, right?

480
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:21,670
Did I ask you for any money?

481
01:17:23,430 --> 01:17:25,899
You wanna blackmail me, isn't it?

482
01:17:26,099 --> 01:17:27,279
What are you up to?

483
01:17:27,479 --> 01:17:28,899
Look

484
01:17:29,099 --> 01:17:31,109
I crashed into a car a
few days ago and got out.

485
01:17:31,309 --> 01:17:33,279
That driver didn't get
a single penny from me.

486
01:17:33,479 --> 01:17:35,710
You think you can rip me off now?

487
01:18:10,390 --> 01:18:12,790
My cue is here.

488
01:18:17,260 --> 01:18:19,790
My cue is here.

489
01:18:25,079 --> 01:18:26,029
This one?

490
01:18:26,229 --> 01:18:28,590
No, the Aomi one.

491
01:18:31,090 --> 01:18:33,000
Can't tell.

492
01:18:35,510 --> 01:18:37,029
This one?

493
01:18:37,229 --> 01:18:39,170
It's carved with words.

494
01:19:02,300 --> 01:19:04,670
Can I exchange it for some cash?

495
01:19:05,140 --> 01:19:07,819
You can ask the owner.
This one is worth 800 Yuan.

496
01:19:08,019 --> 01:19:09,645
I only want 500.

497
01:19:09,845 --> 01:19:12,110
I'll get it back as soon as I have money.

498
01:19:13,550 --> 01:19:17,290
I can't do that. The owner is not here.

499
01:19:20,180 --> 01:19:21,750
400 Yuan will also do.

500
01:19:23,140 --> 01:19:27,630
Come on. I don't have a say.

501
01:19:43,220 --> 01:19:46,540
- I saw a boy at the counter.
- Shut up.

502
01:19:54,970 --> 01:19:58,170
Hello, auntie.

503
01:19:59,890 --> 01:20:01,790
I heard about it.

504
01:20:04,220 --> 01:20:07,460
You should've told me to
pick you up at the airport

505
01:20:10,300 --> 01:20:12,210
I'll meet you at the police station.

506
01:20:13,300 --> 01:20:15,630
I'm coming.

507
01:20:25,890 --> 01:20:27,989
There was a boy coming for his cue.

508
01:20:28,189 --> 01:20:31,590
He might be the one you're looking for.

509
01:20:53,590 --> 01:20:56,130
Where's the kid?

510
01:21:01,590 --> 01:21:03,920
Let's go to the monkey park.

511
01:21:18,090 --> 01:21:20,790
An ambulance was at the school today?

512
01:21:22,760 --> 01:21:24,489
Yes.

513
01:21:24,689 --> 01:21:26,500
What happened?

514
01:21:29,470 --> 01:21:31,340
No idea.

515
01:21:33,010 --> 01:21:35,170
No idea?

516
01:21:36,300 --> 01:21:38,569
A student called Wei
Bu hit Yu Weipeng's son.

517
01:21:38,769 --> 01:21:40,610
The kid is in the hospital now.

518
01:21:41,640 --> 01:21:44,130
That Wei Bu got himself
into huge trouble.

519
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:48,880
What are you so happy about?

520
01:21:49,220 --> 01:21:51,500
I'm not.

521
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:56,420
Don't use my foundation.

522
01:21:58,180 --> 01:22:00,130
I didn't.

523
01:22:02,010 --> 01:22:05,170
Makeup is for grown-ups,
not for you kids.

524
01:22:06,489 --> 01:22:07,439
I did not.

525
01:22:07,639 --> 01:22:09,460
I know you have.

526
01:22:30,390 --> 01:22:32,170
Don't get yourself pregnant

527
01:22:37,470 --> 01:22:38,859
I'm giving you a warning

528
01:22:39,059 --> 01:22:39,779
I have a colleague

529
01:22:39,979 --> 01:22:41,565
who didn't warn her kid in advance.

530
01:22:41,765 --> 01:22:44,040
Then they were in big trouble.

531
01:22:48,590 --> 01:22:50,489
You make me sick.

532
01:22:50,689 --> 01:22:52,710
Stop pretending.

533
01:22:56,970 --> 01:23:00,750
Does shaming me make you happy?

534
01:24:00,510 --> 01:24:02,540
Stop right here.

535
01:24:31,300 --> 01:24:33,029
I saw it.

536
01:24:33,229 --> 01:24:34,960
What?

537
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:37,710
How did it die?

538
01:24:37,970 --> 01:24:39,319
A dog bit it.

539
01:24:39,519 --> 01:24:41,250
Somebody else's dog?

540
01:24:41,590 --> 01:24:42,670
Yes.

541
01:24:43,180 --> 01:24:45,170
What happened?

542
01:24:46,970 --> 01:24:49,130
Why ask?

543
01:24:51,140 --> 01:24:52,710
I need some money.

544
01:24:54,050 --> 01:24:55,790
You want money from me?

545
01:24:56,140 --> 01:24:58,880
It's borrowing. I will return it.

546
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:01,880
Why not ask your parents?

547
01:25:02,930 --> 01:25:06,500
I got into some trouble.
I can't call them now.

548
01:25:07,250 --> 01:25:08,609
But I don't have any money.

549
01:25:08,809 --> 01:25:13,005
I sleep on the balcony.
I can't offer you anything.

550
01:25:13,205 --> 01:25:16,109
I know. I just want to borrow some.

551
01:25:16,309 --> 01:25:17,939
Take a look at this cue.

552
01:25:18,139 --> 01:25:19,649
It cost me over 1,000.

553
01:25:19,849 --> 01:25:21,529
You can ask around in any pool room.

554
01:25:21,729 --> 01:25:23,790
You can keep it as a guaranty.

555
01:25:24,090 --> 01:25:26,170
What do I need this for?

556
01:25:27,340 --> 01:25:29,250
This is the best thing I have

557
01:25:29,470 --> 01:25:31,130
I'll buy it back.

558
01:25:32,680 --> 01:25:35,819
I told you I don't have money.
I don't have my pensions.

559
01:25:36,019 --> 01:25:38,090
You have the wrong person.

560
01:25:39,930 --> 01:25:41,149
I do understand.

561
01:25:41,349 --> 01:25:42,569
Try someone else.

562
01:25:42,769 --> 01:25:44,710
Take a look at this.

563
01:25:44,970 --> 01:25:46,750
Just leave.

564
01:25:48,050 --> 01:25:49,239
Hey.

565
01:25:49,439 --> 01:25:53,670
Where's my dog? Did you kill it?

566
01:25:53,970 --> 01:25:56,670
His dog did it?

567
01:25:58,220 --> 01:26:02,210
Let's go to the police!
Or I'll come down to get you!

568
01:26:22,220 --> 01:26:24,420
What are you up to?

569
01:26:24,640 --> 01:26:26,460
What are you up to?

570
01:26:30,180 --> 01:26:33,670
I can scratch your car all over

571
01:26:34,180 --> 01:26:36,149
and not give you a damn penny for it.

572
01:26:36,349 --> 01:26:38,500
Come if you dare.

573
01:26:41,550 --> 01:26:44,090
Come on.

574
01:26:45,930 --> 01:26:47,040
I won't stop you!

575
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:52,760
Do it!

576
01:26:54,970 --> 01:26:56,790
Come on. Do it!

577
01:27:04,640 --> 01:27:06,590
Do it!

578
01:27:11,300 --> 01:27:15,250
Stop. I didn't hurt your dog.

579
01:27:24,220 --> 01:27:27,290
A truck will kill you both!

580
01:27:53,050 --> 01:27:55,340
I have to go.

581
01:28:20,640 --> 01:28:22,210
I don't need it.

582
01:28:22,760 --> 01:28:24,279
Take it.

583
01:28:24,479 --> 01:28:26,500
You can sell it for some cash.

584
01:28:27,090 --> 01:28:30,090
I can't carry it with me.

585
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:39,960
Do you know Manzhouli?

586
01:28:42,220 --> 01:28:43,380
Yes

587
01:28:44,260 --> 01:28:46,210
I'm going there.

588
01:28:52,300 --> 01:28:54,630
There's an elephant sitting there.

589
01:28:59,680 --> 01:29:02,130
Why does it matter to you?

590
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:07,540
It doesn't.

591
01:29:42,290 --> 01:29:44,069
I want to go and see for myself

592
01:29:44,269 --> 01:29:45,239
I'll go with you.

593
01:29:45,439 --> 01:29:47,210
Don't bother.

594
01:30:06,890 --> 01:30:08,960
I didn't tell them you were here.

595
01:30:11,590 --> 01:30:13,710
You're clean.

596
01:30:19,140 --> 01:30:21,210
You don't have to worry.

597
01:30:21,890 --> 01:30:23,880
How's that?

598
01:31:50,510 --> 01:31:53,290
I heard about this two hours ago.

599
01:32:24,050 --> 01:32:27,790
I could've picked you up at the airport.

600
01:32:33,300 --> 01:32:35,460
I want a cigarette.

601
01:32:54,470 --> 01:32:56,790
Have a new one.

602
01:33:13,930 --> 01:33:16,000
It's so tall.

603
01:34:32,640 --> 01:34:34,420
Aren't you cold?

604
01:34:37,800 --> 01:34:40,210
Was it because Li Kai stole the phone?

605
01:34:41,300 --> 01:34:43,170
He didn't steal it.

606
01:34:52,340 --> 01:34:54,290
How do you know?

607
01:34:54,590 --> 01:34:56,590
I just know it.

608
01:35:11,970 --> 01:35:14,670
What's your plan?

609
01:35:16,090 --> 01:35:18,540
I'm going to buy a ticket.

610
01:35:20,970 --> 01:35:22,670
To where?

611
01:35:25,220 --> 01:35:26,880
Manzhouli.

612
01:35:38,720 --> 01:35:41,710
Go back. It's not that serious.

613
01:35:43,140 --> 01:35:44,540
You don't get it.

614
01:35:46,260 --> 01:35:48,380
What do you want me to do?

615
01:35:52,430 --> 01:35:54,340
You want to join me?

616
01:35:59,010 --> 01:36:01,840
Give me a break.

617
01:36:02,470 --> 01:36:05,090
My Mom just asked me about you.

618
01:36:06,140 --> 01:36:09,340
I don't know where she got the news.

619
01:36:13,800 --> 01:36:16,529
What will you do in Manzhouli?

620
01:36:16,729 --> 01:36:18,210
There will be something.

621
01:36:18,470 --> 01:36:22,460
Look around. Everyone's alive.

622
01:36:25,550 --> 01:36:28,239
It's dangerous for me to come here.

623
01:36:28,439 --> 01:36:31,170
I'll be done if they know it.

624
01:36:31,720 --> 01:36:33,340
No one will know.

625
01:36:38,140 --> 01:36:40,790
Why did you hit him?

626
01:36:48,340 --> 01:36:50,130
I didn't know it until today

627
01:36:50,470 --> 01:36:53,340
that my dad was fired
because he took bribes.

628
01:36:56,090 --> 01:36:58,710
What's that got to do with your fight?

629
01:37:07,050 --> 01:37:10,795
I hit him when I heard it.

630
01:37:10,995 --> 01:37:13,290
It's just natural.

631
01:37:14,840 --> 01:37:16,739
I didn't feel anything

632
01:37:16,939 --> 01:37:19,880
I don't care whether Li Kai
stole the phone or not.

633
01:37:21,930 --> 01:37:23,880
I'm his friend.

634
01:37:25,550 --> 01:37:27,460
I did what I have to do

635
01:37:29,890 --> 01:37:32,210
I've no idea why it ended up like this.

636
01:37:33,680 --> 01:37:35,750
So?

637
01:37:41,140 --> 01:37:45,460
I didn't beat him.
He fell down the staircase.

638
01:37:48,090 --> 01:37:51,000
Then why did you escape?

639
01:37:56,720 --> 01:37:58,920
Are you going to Manzhouli with me?

640
01:37:59,340 --> 01:38:00,529
I can do part-time.

641
01:38:00,729 --> 01:38:03,420
I've worked every summer vacation.
All kinds of work.

642
01:38:04,890 --> 01:38:06,880
You can come back if you want.

643
01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:15,750
Let's see what you're capable of.

644
01:38:18,760 --> 01:38:20,920
You can play shuttlecock.

645
01:38:21,340 --> 01:38:25,000
Yes, I can do that.

646
01:38:27,140 --> 01:38:29,939
So you can perform shuttlecock-kicking
in Manzhouli.

647
01:38:30,139 --> 01:38:32,710
People will give you money for that.

648
01:38:32,970 --> 01:38:35,340
You can settle there then.

649
01:38:41,050 --> 01:38:43,130
Are you making fun of me?

650
01:38:52,340 --> 01:38:56,290
No, just stating the fact.

651
01:38:57,390 --> 01:38:59,460
That is sarcasm.

652
01:39:00,970 --> 01:39:02,630
You were right though.

653
01:39:04,260 --> 01:39:06,130
I can only play shuttlecocks.

654
01:39:13,680 --> 01:39:15,590
You've won prizes for that.

655
01:39:16,430 --> 01:39:17,470
Yes.

656
01:39:17,670 --> 01:39:19,210
Meaning you're really good.

657
01:39:19,970 --> 01:39:21,920
Not at all.

658
01:39:22,390 --> 01:39:26,420
Everyone can waste their
time on any meaningless shit.

659
01:39:28,300 --> 01:39:30,630
It even makes you look
like a freaking pro.

660
01:39:34,970 --> 01:39:37,420
So why shuttlecock?

661
01:39:42,930 --> 01:39:45,590
Because other things
make me feel even worse.

662
01:39:56,590 --> 01:39:58,460
You're leaving?

663
01:39:59,470 --> 01:40:00,470
Yep.

664
01:40:01,470 --> 01:40:03,460
What happened?

665
01:40:04,550 --> 01:40:05,750
Nothing.

666
01:40:11,720 --> 01:40:16,920
I just can't go with you. It's not good.

667
01:40:18,050 --> 01:40:19,290
Really.

668
01:40:26,500 --> 01:40:27,899
You don't have to run away.

669
01:40:28,099 --> 01:40:29,130
Just leave.

670
01:41:10,390 --> 01:41:11,920
You play pool?

671
01:41:12,970 --> 01:41:14,840
Entry level.

672
01:41:43,800 --> 01:41:48,380
That asshole.

673
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:08,750
Cut the bullshit!

674
01:43:14,430 --> 01:43:15,500
Smash it!

675
01:44:20,890 --> 01:44:23,130
This is the cue.

676
01:44:23,430 --> 01:44:24,790
Aomi.

677
01:44:26,680 --> 01:44:29,090
He showed it off in the pool room.

678
01:44:29,800 --> 01:44:32,840
Who knows where he's
stolen the money for this.

679
01:44:36,050 --> 01:44:37,540
Is this yours?

680
01:44:37,930 --> 01:44:39,380
Yes.

681
01:44:40,510 --> 01:44:42,500
Wanna play with me?

682
01:44:43,220 --> 01:44:45,420
Not today.

683
01:44:47,340 --> 01:44:49,210
When are you free?

684
01:44:53,680 --> 01:44:54,859
Dad, what's going on?

685
01:44:55,059 --> 01:44:56,750
Get out!

686
01:44:58,050 --> 01:44:59,359
You deaf?

687
01:44:59,559 --> 01:45:02,000
Is that you, Grandpa?

688
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:09,090
There's a name on it.

689
01:45:13,840 --> 01:45:16,340
Let's save some time.

690
01:45:16,590 --> 01:45:18,590
Where did you get this?

691
01:45:22,510 --> 01:45:26,790
What are you going to
do when you find him?

692
01:45:32,680 --> 01:45:34,720
He beat up a piece of trash

693
01:45:34,920 --> 01:45:36,880
and that piece of trash is my brother.

694
01:45:37,840 --> 01:45:39,630
What do you think I should do?

695
01:45:40,930 --> 01:45:42,880
A piece of trash brother?

696
01:45:43,930 --> 01:45:46,290
That's right.

697
01:45:48,970 --> 01:45:51,130
A piece of trash.

698
01:45:53,550 --> 01:45:55,000
Yes.

699
01:46:25,140 --> 01:46:26,859
I'm going to the train station.

700
01:46:27,059 --> 01:46:29,630
Keep an eye on him. Don't let him go.

701
01:47:08,970 --> 01:47:10,210
Watch this.

702
01:47:14,970 --> 01:47:16,180
Let him take a look.

703
01:47:17,720 --> 01:47:22,630
Hey old man, watch this.

704
01:47:30,590 --> 01:47:34,210
Grandpa are you there?

705
01:47:35,390 --> 01:47:36,359
Cut the crap!

706
01:47:36,559 --> 01:47:37,859
Don't mess with us.

707
01:47:38,059 --> 01:47:39,840
Piss off.

708
01:47:49,090 --> 01:47:51,130
Where's the puppy?

709
01:48:06,590 --> 01:48:10,210
Come back home Grandpa!

710
01:48:20,890 --> 01:48:22,040
Come here.

711
01:48:23,220 --> 01:48:25,420
He wants a copy for himself.

712
01:48:32,180 --> 01:48:34,170
You two, come to the train station.

713
01:48:34,970 --> 01:48:36,790
I have something else to do.

714
01:51:07,220 --> 01:51:10,210
That's the dean from my brother's school.

715
01:51:14,010 --> 01:51:16,130
What's your brother's name?

716
01:51:17,260 --> 01:51:21,170
Yu Shuai. You know him?

717
01:51:22,890 --> 01:51:24,960
Heard of him.

718
01:51:27,010 --> 01:51:29,250
That's your girlfriend inside?

719
01:51:30,220 --> 01:51:34,840
No. I don't have other things to do.

720
01:51:37,470 --> 01:51:39,920
You have to be careful.

721
01:51:42,390 --> 01:51:44,380
About what?

722
01:51:46,220 --> 01:51:49,250
Don't be good-for-nothing
when you're at my age.

723
01:51:55,390 --> 01:51:58,960
What's the difference
if you're of any use?

724
01:52:08,640 --> 01:52:12,130
You should go inside and punch that dean.

725
01:52:13,720 --> 01:52:15,500
He is the vice dean.

726
01:52:16,640 --> 01:52:18,790
You'd go inside if he were the dean?

727
01:52:22,390 --> 01:52:25,340
There's no difference. I wouldn't dare.

728
01:52:36,220 --> 01:52:43,750
You should let her know that
you came by, and you saw it.

729
01:52:45,260 --> 01:52:47,210
Why's that?

730
01:52:57,050 --> 01:53:00,380
Or you will be just like
this freaking trash can.

731
01:53:28,430 --> 01:53:31,790
(You're screwed)

732
01:56:03,220 --> 01:56:05,210
What's going on?

733
01:56:13,090 --> 01:56:17,880
Group chat.
They have nothing better to do.

734
01:56:24,840 --> 01:56:27,590
The school didn't call the police. Why?

735
01:56:29,470 --> 01:56:32,000
The fight?

736
01:56:32,890 --> 01:56:35,290
Better settle it privately.

737
01:56:36,680 --> 01:56:39,939
Yu's family has a car dealership.

738
01:56:40,139 --> 01:56:46,040
Settling it privately is the best
way out, for Wei Bu or for the school.

739
01:56:47,760 --> 01:56:50,590
His brother is looking for Wei Bu.

740
01:56:51,590 --> 01:56:53,880
That's fine.

741
01:56:54,970 --> 01:56:57,040
Wei Bu hit him.

742
01:56:57,340 --> 01:56:59,340
He has to pay for that.

743
01:57:01,260 --> 01:57:03,460
Nothing serious.

744
01:57:12,720 --> 01:57:15,920
What do people make of
things happening to them?

745
01:57:16,800 --> 01:57:22,460
What do you mean?

746
01:57:24,800 --> 01:57:30,630
I don't think Wei Bu
knew what he was doing.

747
01:57:33,180 --> 01:57:36,880
He surely didn't.

748
01:57:38,180 --> 01:57:43,565
When I was at school,
there was a guy in class.

749
01:57:43,765 --> 01:57:47,795
One day, I saw him with a
stray cat at the riverside.

750
01:57:47,995 --> 01:57:50,210
He found some stones.

751
01:57:50,680 --> 01:57:55,710
And he slowly smashed the cat to death.

752
01:57:58,220 --> 01:57:59,960
And then?

753
01:58:02,090 --> 01:58:04,569
He was often bullied back then.

754
01:58:04,769 --> 01:58:06,670
His grades sucked as well.

755
01:58:07,260 --> 01:58:12,540
Teachers said that he had no future.

756
01:58:13,720 --> 01:58:18,710
But these had nothing to
do with him killing the cat.

757
01:58:22,180 --> 01:58:29,460
He was just happy doing it.

758
01:58:36,430 --> 01:58:39,210
And you were watching as he did it?

759
01:58:40,050 --> 01:58:41,250
Yep.

760
01:58:43,800 --> 01:58:48,420
I wanted to stop him.
That was the right thing to do.

761
01:58:48,800 --> 01:58:51,460
But if I did

762
01:58:51,720 --> 01:58:54,880
I would have something to do with it.

763
01:58:55,140 --> 01:58:59,420
So I just watched.

764
01:59:01,470 --> 01:59:08,540
I have to admit that I enjoyed
watching the whole thing.

765
01:59:12,760 --> 01:59:15,670
Why are you telling me this?

766
01:59:22,430 --> 01:59:24,739
I want you to know.

767
01:59:24,939 --> 01:59:29,899
Daily routines have always been the same
across different ages.

768
01:59:30,099 --> 01:59:33,040
You don't have to be confused.

769
01:59:34,470 --> 01:59:39,000
People will get it over time.

770
01:59:46,640 --> 01:59:49,170
Can I get myself?

771
01:59:58,140 --> 02:00:02,359
Life just won't get better.

772
02:00:02,559 --> 02:00:06,920
It's all about agony.

773
02:00:07,300 --> 02:00:11,630
That agony has begun since you were born.

774
02:00:12,840 --> 02:00:16,069
You think that a new place
will change your fate?

775
02:00:16,269 --> 02:00:19,040
It's bullshit.

776
02:00:20,010 --> 02:00:23,540
New place, new sufferings.

777
02:00:27,340 --> 02:00:29,460
You understand?

778
02:00:31,760 --> 02:00:37,880
No one truly knows about existence.

779
02:00:52,180 --> 02:00:55,500
Where should I go if school is closed?

780
02:01:02,890 --> 02:01:06,460
Find another one.

781
02:01:20,550 --> 02:01:22,750
You're not divorced.

782
02:01:23,720 --> 02:01:26,630
I saw you pick up your kid.

783
02:01:37,300 --> 02:01:41,170
We're separated.

784
02:01:52,970 --> 02:01:58,170
Easy. I was kidding.

785
02:02:02,720 --> 02:02:05,290
What are you worried about?

786
02:02:08,640 --> 02:02:11,670
Nothing

787
02:02:12,970 --> 02:02:15,750
I'm quite at ease at the moment.

788
02:03:59,220 --> 02:04:02,380
It's been there for a while.

789
02:04:15,300 --> 02:04:19,750
Where's the puppy, Grandpa?

790
02:04:20,340 --> 02:04:22,420
It's dead, right?

791
02:04:24,220 --> 02:04:27,170
Is the puppy dead?

792
02:04:29,430 --> 02:04:31,210
It's an old dog.

793
02:04:32,220 --> 02:04:34,340
I can take her to school.

794
02:04:35,970 --> 02:04:44,250
Dad, don't be too sad.

795
02:04:44,470 --> 02:04:47,045
It's no easy thing keeping a pet.

796
02:04:47,245 --> 02:04:50,239
Even harder if it gets sick.

797
02:04:50,439 --> 02:04:53,130
The vets are really expensive.

798
02:04:56,760 --> 02:05:00,819
What have you got yourself into?

799
02:05:01,019 --> 02:05:04,460
It's OK. I can handle it.

800
02:05:06,800 --> 02:05:09,710
It's not that bad.

801
02:05:11,220 --> 02:05:13,590
You can go to the nursing home now.

802
02:05:14,050 --> 02:05:18,710
I just called them.

803
02:05:19,010 --> 02:05:22,000
An army commander lives there.

804
02:05:22,220 --> 02:05:25,630
You two will get along well.

805
02:05:31,260 --> 02:05:33,739
No rush.

806
02:05:33,939 --> 02:05:37,040
Just think about it.

807
02:05:38,640 --> 02:05:40,210
Let's have dinner.

808
02:05:41,890 --> 02:05:43,630
I ate already.

809
02:05:51,840 --> 02:05:55,460
It's a nice cue. Where did you get it?

810
02:05:56,340 --> 02:05:59,960
Come down here you old piece of crap!

811
02:06:05,340 --> 02:06:07,630
Get your butt down here!

812
02:06:11,220 --> 02:06:14,380
Shall we call the police?

813
02:06:19,800 --> 02:06:21,670
Fine.

814
02:08:00,340 --> 02:08:02,399
Thank you both.

815
02:08:02,599 --> 02:08:06,170
Thank you for taking care of this.

816
02:08:10,260 --> 02:08:11,920
Bye.

817
02:08:40,470 --> 02:08:42,170
What's wrong?

818
02:08:44,930 --> 02:08:46,630
Nothing.

819
02:08:50,260 --> 02:08:52,750
Why're you looking at me?

820
02:08:56,550 --> 02:08:59,040
Then where should I look?

821
02:09:00,140 --> 02:09:04,920
Who knows.
I don't like people staring at me.

822
02:09:07,140 --> 02:09:09,090
Come on.

823
02:09:16,550 --> 02:09:19,040
I'll grab a bite.

824
02:09:41,390 --> 02:09:43,755
You just left a restaurant

825
02:09:43,955 --> 02:09:46,590
I didn't eat much.

826
02:09:50,930 --> 02:09:53,170
What are you doing here?

827
02:09:54,300 --> 02:09:56,420
Hanging out with you.

828
02:10:00,720 --> 02:10:03,210
You just came?

829
02:10:06,840 --> 02:10:09,380
I feel relaxed with you.

830
02:10:20,340 --> 02:10:22,670
It's not going to work out between us.

831
02:10:23,470 --> 02:10:25,645
We're not the same kind of people.

832
02:10:25,845 --> 02:10:28,590
It'll get us nowhere no
matter how many times you try.

833
02:10:34,140 --> 02:10:36,750
Then who is your kind?

834
02:10:39,430 --> 02:10:41,710
Not you at least.

835
02:10:44,760 --> 02:10:49,130
We don't understand each other.

836
02:10:52,550 --> 02:10:54,750
Awesome, that sounds really complicated.

837
02:10:59,220 --> 02:11:00,250
Here it is, again.

838
02:11:02,090 --> 02:11:06,670
Your attitude is so annoying.

839
02:11:07,800 --> 02:11:10,210
You make me feel uncomfortable.

840
02:11:35,470 --> 02:11:38,170
I slept with my friend's
wife this morning.

841
02:11:40,680 --> 02:11:45,750
He found out and jumped off the building.

842
02:11:48,090 --> 02:11:51,130
I have to stay away for a while.

843
02:11:59,140 --> 02:12:01,210
Why are you doing this?

844
02:12:04,800 --> 02:12:06,960
Because you refused to see me.

845
02:12:11,220 --> 02:12:16,210
I won't change my mind.

846
02:12:20,840 --> 02:12:24,430
I'm telling you because
it's all your fault.

847
02:12:24,630 --> 02:12:27,090
It's because of you that he's dead.

848
02:12:33,970 --> 02:12:35,775
What's the matter with you?

849
02:12:35,975 --> 02:12:36,970
Ah!

850
02:12:41,930 --> 02:12:43,250
Get out.

851
02:12:43,640 --> 02:12:45,040
Out!

852
02:12:52,090 --> 02:12:53,710
Get the hell out!

853
02:12:56,930 --> 02:12:58,250
Don't move!

854
02:12:59,010 --> 02:13:00,670
Don't freaking move!

855
02:14:16,690 --> 02:14:18,359
A professor boards a fishing boat.

856
02:14:18,559 --> 02:14:21,109
He asks the fisherman
if he understands poetry.

857
02:14:21,309 --> 02:14:22,399
The fisherman says no.

858
02:14:22,599 --> 02:14:25,505
The professor says
"your life is reduced to half".

859
02:14:25,705 --> 02:14:28,689
Then he asks if the
fisherman understands music.

860
02:14:28,889 --> 02:14:30,290
He says no again.

861
02:14:30,510 --> 02:14:33,900
The professor says "then the
other half of your life is gone".

862
02:14:34,220 --> 02:14:37,109
The fisherman asks if the
professor knows how to swim.

863
02:14:37,309 --> 02:14:39,000
The professor says he can't

864
02:14:39,260 --> 02:14:41,290
"then your whole life is gone."

865
02:14:41,550 --> 02:14:44,630
And the professor is
thrown into the water.

866
02:15:55,789 --> 02:15:56,739
Hello?

867
02:15:56,939 --> 02:15:59,040
Have you checked our group chat?

868
02:15:59,300 --> 02:16:01,170
Hurry up.

869
02:16:03,090 --> 02:16:05,880
The message that just came in.

870
02:16:06,720 --> 02:16:09,290
It was already in other
group chats yesterday.

871
02:16:54,510 --> 02:16:56,040
What happened?

872
02:17:33,430 --> 02:17:34,670
Who filmed this?

873
02:17:38,220 --> 02:17:39,960
I don't know

874
02:17:43,970 --> 02:17:46,090
I'm ruined.

875
02:17:52,930 --> 02:17:54,340
Well.

876
02:18:04,470 --> 02:18:08,620
That guy at the restaurant
with the note...

877
02:18:08,820 --> 02:18:11,880
was stalking us?

878
02:18:14,140 --> 02:18:16,819
These clips began to spread yesterday.

879
02:18:17,019 --> 02:18:20,250
Why are people so freaking nosy?

880
02:18:20,550 --> 02:18:23,489
Why are people so evil?

881
02:18:23,689 --> 02:18:26,779
And they're so young!

882
02:18:26,979 --> 02:18:32,210
Somebody will come get you
when you're minding your own business.

883
02:18:43,430 --> 02:18:45,540
Why are you cursing?

884
02:19:02,760 --> 02:19:04,340
Just go.

885
02:19:05,970 --> 02:19:10,840
You ruined me.
I can't transfer to the new school now.

886
02:19:31,800 --> 02:19:35,090
Take your things.

887
02:20:36,140 --> 02:20:38,630
Why did you go back?

888
02:20:40,510 --> 02:20:46,130
How the hell should I know.

889
02:20:46,930 --> 02:20:49,750
Don't talk to me like that.

890
02:20:51,890 --> 02:20:58,170
Fine. I don't care about anyone, OK?

891
02:21:02,390 --> 02:21:05,630
I don't know if my
brother is dead or not.

892
02:21:06,470 --> 02:21:09,840
Either I'm going to
find that little brat

893
02:21:10,760 --> 02:21:13,880
or I'm going to see my
brother at the hospital.

894
02:21:15,760 --> 02:21:18,630
Then why are you here?

895
02:21:20,340 --> 02:21:23,070
Didn't I tell you?
I have to go away for a while.

896
02:21:23,930 --> 02:21:25,210
I'm leaving tonight.

897
02:21:35,930 --> 02:21:37,840
You'd better go now.

898
02:21:44,510 --> 02:21:46,210
Where were we?

899
02:21:47,390 --> 02:21:48,960
What?

900
02:21:49,720 --> 02:21:54,710
You said your friend died because of me.

901
02:21:55,180 --> 02:21:57,420
Yes.

902
02:21:58,720 --> 02:22:00,500
Tell me about it.

903
02:22:01,430 --> 02:22:03,210
About what?

904
02:22:04,390 --> 02:22:07,920
He killed himself because of me.

905
02:22:09,050 --> 02:22:11,250
I don't see any connections.

906
02:22:14,340 --> 02:22:16,670
You rejected me.

907
02:22:17,930 --> 02:22:20,790
So I went to his place
and slept with his wife.

908
02:22:21,340 --> 02:22:23,460
Then he jumped off the building.

909
02:22:26,930 --> 02:22:29,040
So I can't say no to you?

910
02:22:29,800 --> 02:22:32,250
You believe you're somebody, don't you?

911
02:22:33,890 --> 02:22:36,460
You started all this mess.

912
02:22:40,800 --> 02:22:43,840
You're playing innocent or what?

913
02:23:20,970 --> 02:23:27,880
My life is like a dumpster.

914
02:23:28,760 --> 02:23:31,380
Garbage keeps piling up.

915
02:23:32,930 --> 02:23:37,590
They come one after another.
You can never clean it up.

916
02:23:41,180 --> 02:23:47,130
Everybody is the same.

917
02:23:49,050 --> 02:23:52,130
You think you're the only
one that can't take it?

918
02:23:56,470 --> 02:23:59,710
You're always very blunt
when it comes to me.

919
02:24:00,970 --> 02:24:03,420
Because you won't let me go.

920
02:24:03,669 --> 02:24:05,569
It wasn't like this from the beginning.

921
02:24:05,769 --> 02:24:08,920
That's right.

922
02:24:10,220 --> 02:24:13,750
But it didn't last long.

923
02:24:16,050 --> 02:24:17,840
I started to feel uncomfortable.

924
02:24:18,590 --> 02:24:21,880
Yes, you told me that.

925
02:24:22,260 --> 02:24:24,109
That's right.

926
02:24:24,309 --> 02:24:27,040
No one ever feels comfortable.

927
02:24:29,590 --> 02:24:31,250
It's only you.

928
02:24:40,140 --> 02:24:42,090
Do you feel comfortable?

929
02:24:46,260 --> 02:24:47,790
Why do you ask?

930
02:24:49,930 --> 02:24:53,170
You are faking it.

931
02:24:54,840 --> 02:24:57,090
The way you are.

932
02:24:57,890 --> 02:25:00,040
You make that up.

933
02:25:01,010 --> 02:25:04,170
Actually you're no different
than any other women.

934
02:25:06,390 --> 02:25:08,500
You're so dark.

935
02:25:09,760 --> 02:25:11,590
All the same.

936
02:25:14,260 --> 02:25:16,590
Who gives you the right to say that?

937
02:25:22,090 --> 02:25:27,170
I'm watching you, everyday.

938
02:25:27,890 --> 02:25:30,630
See how you present yourself.

939
02:25:32,050 --> 02:25:39,500
Skiing, scuba diving...
all that middle-class stuff.

940
02:25:42,680 --> 02:25:45,090
Look around.

941
02:25:45,340 --> 02:25:48,090
What's the point of faking
a middle-class life?

942
02:25:54,140 --> 02:25:57,590
You don't have to sound bitter
because I don't want to sleep with you.

943
02:26:04,050 --> 02:26:06,290
Yeah, probably

944
02:26:22,950 --> 02:26:25,169
I'm going to Manzhouli
to check out something.

945
02:26:25,369 --> 02:26:26,320
Wanna come with me?

946
02:26:26,640 --> 02:26:27,920
Not interested.

947
02:26:29,720 --> 02:26:33,170
You don't wanna know
what I want to see there?

948
02:26:36,760 --> 02:26:38,880
I'm going to tell you anyway.

949
02:26:39,800 --> 02:26:42,290
The funniest thing I've ever heard.

950
02:26:45,140 --> 02:26:49,040
There's this elephant in a zoo.

951
02:26:49,550 --> 02:26:52,540
It just sits there all day long.

952
02:26:53,050 --> 02:26:55,340
What's fun about that?

953
02:27:01,930 --> 02:27:04,460
The suicide guy told me one week ago.

954
02:27:09,010 --> 02:27:11,630
You're not interested?

955
02:27:14,590 --> 02:27:17,460
I'm not going anywhere with you.

956
02:27:25,260 --> 02:27:28,040
Why are you standing here?

957
02:27:31,340 --> 02:27:33,130
I can leave.

958
02:28:19,300 --> 02:28:23,880
Be my guest. I'm going to the hospital

959
02:28:26,470 --> 02:28:32,920
to check out a dumbass, his crazy mother

960
02:28:34,300 --> 02:28:36,420
and an old wretch.

961
02:28:38,550 --> 02:28:41,000
You're not leaving with me?

962
02:28:41,590 --> 02:28:43,670
Why?

963
02:28:45,720 --> 02:28:48,670
I don't want to leave you alone.

964
02:28:52,340 --> 02:28:55,380
Cut the crap.

965
02:30:51,890 --> 02:30:53,290
Who is it?

966
02:30:53,680 --> 02:30:55,750
You need to do me a favor.

967
02:30:56,430 --> 02:30:59,630
Where are you? We were looking for you.

968
02:31:00,090 --> 02:31:02,880
The shopping mall near the hospital.

969
02:31:07,220 --> 02:31:08,529
Did you see him?

970
02:31:08,729 --> 02:31:10,819
Take you hands off me.

971
02:31:11,019 --> 02:31:12,359
Don't stumble over.

972
02:31:12,559 --> 02:31:14,250
At the entrance.

973
02:31:18,220 --> 02:31:21,939
We're supposed to meet up here.
But he didn't tell me when.

974
02:31:22,139 --> 02:31:24,290
Where's he now?

975
02:31:24,640 --> 02:31:27,090
I'll look over there.

976
02:31:40,800 --> 02:31:45,840
I can't find him.

977
02:31:46,510 --> 02:31:49,420
Let's go upstairs.

978
02:31:50,680 --> 02:31:52,540
Let's go upstairs.

979
02:32:19,430 --> 02:32:22,040
Let's check on different spots.

980
02:32:34,260 --> 02:32:36,630
Wei Bu! Where were you?

981
02:32:39,760 --> 02:32:43,960
Wei Bu! Take your hands off me!

982
02:32:49,430 --> 02:32:53,670
Let me go! Wei Bu!

983
02:32:58,970 --> 02:33:01,840
You freaking sold me out!

984
02:33:02,050 --> 02:33:06,930
I only told your parents.
They could help you out.

985
02:33:07,130 --> 02:33:09,500
They're the only ones you can go to.

986
02:33:10,640 --> 02:33:12,649
Did I say not to tell anybody?

987
02:33:12,849 --> 02:33:14,590
Did I or didn't I?

988
02:33:15,840 --> 02:33:17,710
You piece of crap!

989
02:33:18,430 --> 02:33:24,170
Yes, that's right.

990
02:33:24,760 --> 02:33:26,250
What's right?

991
02:33:26,970 --> 02:33:29,069
The way you are.

992
02:33:29,269 --> 02:33:33,000
I tried to help you out,
but you don't give a damn.

993
02:33:33,220 --> 02:33:36,029
No one gives a damn about me.

994
02:33:36,229 --> 02:33:37,069
What do you mean?

995
02:33:37,269 --> 02:33:39,340
I am nothing!

996
02:33:46,470 --> 02:33:48,920
What was your plan then?

997
02:33:50,430 --> 02:33:52,290
Send my Dad to take me away?

998
02:33:52,840 --> 02:33:55,210
Keep me safe in prison?

999
02:33:57,640 --> 02:34:00,399
Yu Cheng went to your place
and smashed a lot of stuff.

1000
02:34:00,599 --> 02:34:03,090
They're worried.

1001
02:34:11,590 --> 02:34:14,210
They can't help.

1002
02:34:20,970 --> 02:34:23,290
You were wrong the whole time.

1003
02:34:25,010 --> 02:34:27,460
I stole that cellphone.

1004
02:34:32,720 --> 02:34:34,920
He shot a lot of videos on his phone.

1005
02:34:35,340 --> 02:34:40,880
He recorded me taking a piss.

1006
02:34:50,240 --> 02:34:52,189
You said you hadn't stolen the phone.

1007
02:34:52,389 --> 02:34:54,149
Because I lied to you.

1008
02:34:54,349 --> 02:34:58,710
I'd rather buy him a new one
than let him keep the video.

1009
02:35:11,300 --> 02:35:13,590
You worthless punk.

1010
02:35:14,800 --> 02:35:20,290
I'm probably the last
person to see who you are.

1011
02:35:24,970 --> 02:35:27,420
There're other videos on his phone.

1012
02:35:28,930 --> 02:35:31,480
Like Huang Ling with the
vice dean at a karaoke bar.

1013
02:35:35,930 --> 02:35:37,790
You shouldn't have beaten him up.

1014
02:35:38,260 --> 02:35:42,590
He's a coward. A little scare will do.

1015
02:35:43,390 --> 02:35:49,170
Now it's all screwed up.

1016
02:36:02,760 --> 02:36:05,210
You're saying I screwed this up?

1017
02:36:06,260 --> 02:36:07,790
Yes you did.

1018
02:36:09,470 --> 02:36:14,630
I've told you this.

1019
02:36:15,800 --> 02:36:18,000
I'm not scared of anything.

1020
02:36:19,390 --> 02:36:21,380
I can do anything.

1021
02:36:22,760 --> 02:36:25,170
I'll do fine without you.

1022
02:36:37,840 --> 02:36:40,710
Where the hell can you go?

1023
02:36:45,430 --> 02:36:47,710
You will freaking rot in here.

1024

(Nursing Home - Visiting Hours)

1025
02:38:10,640 --> 02:38:12,960
I want to take a look.

02:44:13,010 --> 02:44:15,239
There's a Yu Shuai here...

1029
02:44:15,439 --> 02:44:17,790
how's he doing?

1030
02:44:22,340 --> 02:44:25,040
There's a Yu...

(Surgical Department Zone 1)

1032
02:45:41,590 --> 02:45:44,040
Shut up.

1033
02:45:45,550 --> 02:45:47,210
What have you done?

1034
02:45:47,720 --> 02:45:49,960
Don't yell at me.

1035
02:45:51,010 --> 02:45:55,670
Look at him! He's lying there!

1036
02:46:00,800 --> 02:46:05,069
Why not call the police?

1037
02:46:05,269 --> 02:46:09,090
Arrest that asshole!

1038
02:46:13,140 --> 02:46:16,960
I've looked for him all day.
I'm not stupid.

1039
02:46:21,680 --> 02:46:25,040
Once you beat him almost deaf!

1040
02:46:25,470 --> 02:46:29,460
You and your gang abused him!

1041

Oh crap, not again!

1042
02:46:34,680 --> 02:46:37,040
Get out!

1043
02:48:14,800 --> 02:48:17,399
Hey kiddo. Throw that shuttlecock over!

1044
02:48:17,599 --> 02:48:19,460
Come on!

1045
02:48:20,010 --> 02:48:21,819
Hey! You prick!

1046
02:48:22,019 --> 02:48:23,149
Screw you.

1047
02:48:23,349 --> 02:48:24,359
What did you say? Say it again?

1048
02:48:24,559 --> 02:48:25,899
I said screw you! You hear that?

1049
02:48:26,099 --> 02:48:27,399
Come over here!

1050
02:48:27,599 --> 02:48:29,939
You'll be dead! I'll kill you!

Wait right there, you little brat!

Come over and I'll kill you!

1053

Stop. That's enough.

1054
02:48:41,760 --> 02:48:43,210
Let go!

1055
02:48:44,640 --> 02:48:46,569

Damn you! You piece of trash!

1059

Stay right there if you dare.

1060
02:48:54,479 --> 02:48:58,029
Stay right there!

1061
02:48:58,229 --> 02:49:00,689
Come back!

1062
02:49:00,889 --> 02:49:03,290
It's not worth it.

1063
02:50:35,800 --> 02:50:38,899
You're a scumbag!

1064
02:50:39,099 --> 02:50:42,170
You're the most disgusting
thing I've ever seen!

Damn you!

Tickets?

1069
02:52:34,340 --> 02:52:35,630
Where to?

1070
02:52:36,050 --> 02:52:37,819
Manzhouli

1071
02:52:38,019 --> 02:52:39,710
I have tickets to Manzhouli.

1072
02:52:40,590 --> 02:52:42,670
I can line up here.

1073
02:52:43,180 --> 02:52:45,239
A couple of tour groups
were here earlier.

1074
02:52:45,439 --> 02:52:47,840
You won't get a ticket in two hours.

1075
02:52:51,970 --> 02:52:53,750
You're home.

1076
02:52:58,760 --> 02:53:03,090
That deputy chief tried
to touch me over dinner.

1077
02:53:04,659 --> 02:53:05,609
He ain't nothing.

1078
02:53:05,809 --> 02:53:08,670
He pretended to be drunk.

1079
02:53:10,800 --> 02:53:13,000
What good could he do for me?

1080
02:53:14,260 --> 02:53:16,399
That bald good-for-nothing.

1081
02:53:16,599 --> 02:53:18,630
I want to tell you something.

1082
02:53:19,390 --> 02:53:21,790
He was talking big.

1083
02:53:22,180 --> 02:53:24,840
Says he wanted to buy all
the medicine I'm selling.

1084
02:53:27,140 --> 02:53:29,840
What for?

1085
02:53:30,550 --> 02:53:33,420
I can sell it to anybody.

1086
02:53:36,430 --> 02:53:38,340
I want to tell you something.

1087
02:53:39,050 --> 02:53:41,500
Where did you come back from?

1088
02:53:49,340 --> 02:53:52,540
The vice dean at the school
has been very nice to me.

1089
02:53:53,260 --> 02:53:54,920
Really nice.

1090
02:53:56,970 --> 02:53:59,920
I feel much more comfortable
with him than at home.

1091
02:54:08,300 --> 02:54:10,590
Did he sleep with you?

1092
02:54:17,260 --> 02:54:18,835
Why?

1093
02:54:19,035 --> 02:54:21,500
Why what?

1094
02:54:33,970 --> 02:54:36,660
You've messed up my life.

1095
02:54:36,860 --> 02:54:40,000
Every morning I have to pick
up your clothes from the floor.

1096
02:54:40,220 --> 02:54:43,380
If they're stained,
I'm the one that does the laundry.

1097
02:54:43,680 --> 02:54:47,880
I always smell of delivered food.
It takes time to clean the smell.

1098
02:54:49,090 --> 02:54:53,090
Did he screw you?

1099
02:55:02,300 --> 02:55:05,040
I enjoy hanging out at his place.

1100
02:55:05,470 --> 02:55:09,500
It's clean and tidy.
I don't need to clean it up.

1101
02:55:11,890 --> 02:55:14,790
Can you let me finish?

1102
02:55:26,720 --> 02:55:28,380
Go ahead.

1103
02:55:42,890 --> 02:55:45,420
Somebody leaked a video of us.

1104
02:55:48,550 --> 02:55:51,090
But we haven't done anything out of line.

1105
02:55:53,590 --> 02:55:56,040
Everybody from school knows it.

1106
02:55:59,840 --> 02:56:02,250
You're going to be famous.

1107
02:56:24,970 --> 02:56:27,630
What should I do?

1108
02:56:29,970 --> 02:56:32,170
What do you want me to do?

1109
02:56:33,470 --> 02:56:36,630
To sleep with that baldy
and sign the sales contract?

1110
02:56:42,970 --> 02:56:47,090
You're the most selfish and
disgusting person I know.

1111
02:56:51,590 --> 02:56:56,210
No,
that person is thousands of miles away.

1112
02:56:58,220 --> 02:57:02,399
Go and find him!

1113
02:57:02,599 --> 02:57:05,939
You find this apartment dirty?
Send for a cleaner!

1114
02:57:06,139 --> 02:57:07,710
Find a cleaner!

1115
02:57:07,970 --> 02:57:10,590
I have my own work to do!

1116
02:57:11,090 --> 02:57:12,779
You just do some shitty homework?

1117
02:57:12,979 --> 02:57:15,670
No time to find a cleaner?

1118
02:57:38,630 --> 02:57:40,689
I'll go and sleep with that baldy.
Happy?

1119
02:57:40,889 --> 02:57:43,529
Yes! I'm calling him right away!

1120
02:57:43,729 --> 02:57:46,250
I'll tell him myself.

1121
02:57:47,090 --> 02:57:50,630
My daughter is much younger.

1122
02:57:58,140 --> 02:58:01,210
You make me sick.

1123
02:58:07,220 --> 02:58:09,420
Same here.

1124
02:58:12,590 --> 02:58:16,250
You know nothing about life.

1125
02:58:18,890 --> 02:58:22,859
I don't have time to
give you what you like

1126
02:58:23,059 --> 02:58:26,840
I'm living this messy life myself.

1127
02:58:34,720 --> 02:58:37,000
My life's miserable.

1128
02:58:41,510 --> 02:58:43,960
But it's not because of me.

1129
02:58:47,340 --> 02:58:49,250
It's always been like this

1130
02:58:53,340 --> 02:58:58,710
I'm like this, you're like this.

1131
02:59:03,510 --> 02:59:05,500
It's always been like this.

1132
02:59:43,890 --> 02:59:45,210
Where're you going?

1133
03:00:14,430 --> 03:00:16,250
Who is it?

1134
03:00:21,220 --> 03:00:23,170
Where's your daughter?

1135
03:00:24,390 --> 03:00:26,939
She's not home. You can talk to me.

1136
03:00:27,139 --> 03:00:28,399
You know what's going on?

1137
03:00:28,599 --> 03:00:30,130
I just learned.

1138
03:00:32,390 --> 03:00:38,500
Well, a good mother you are.

1139
03:00:39,590 --> 03:00:42,109
My daughter is a victim.

1140
03:00:42,309 --> 03:00:44,290
Victim?

1141
03:00:46,840 --> 03:00:49,040
Victim?

1142
03:00:50,300 --> 03:00:52,630
Your husband is her teacher.

1143
03:00:53,180 --> 03:00:59,380
Yes, Mr. Teacher. It's your turn.

1144
03:01:00,300 --> 03:01:04,835
Calm down. We can talk it through.

1145
03:01:05,035 --> 03:01:08,645
Talk? Talk about what?

1146
03:01:08,845 --> 03:01:13,500
Like how this 17-year-old little slut
hooked up with my man?

1147
03:01:14,680 --> 03:01:17,210
I'm gonna take a look at her.

1148
03:01:21,680 --> 03:01:24,590
Only two rooms in this shithole, right?

1149
03:01:26,890 --> 03:01:28,279
Open the door!

1150
03:01:28,479 --> 03:01:30,700
You can talk to me.

1151
03:01:30,900 --> 03:01:34,439
Don't stand in my way!
Get out, you dirty brat!

1152
03:01:34,639 --> 03:01:36,960
Who do you think you are?

1153
03:01:37,220 --> 03:01:40,460
Coming here for shit like this!

1154
03:01:42,260 --> 03:01:45,170
Stop making a scene.

1155
03:01:46,300 --> 03:01:49,545
Come out Ling. You'll be fine.

1156
03:01:49,745 --> 03:01:51,439
Shut the hell up!

1157
03:01:51,639 --> 03:01:55,420
I should bring our son and
let him see who you are.

1158
03:01:56,470 --> 03:02:02,750
Now you know shame? I'll kick
the door in if you don't open it!

1159
03:02:26,050 --> 03:02:30,920
Why do you have to embarrass everybody?

1160
03:02:32,180 --> 03:02:34,130
Embarrass?

1161
03:02:39,590 --> 03:02:41,460
I'm the most embarrassed one!

1162
03:02:44,800 --> 03:02:51,670
I'm the most embarrassed
one in all of you!

1163
03:05:04,470 --> 03:05:05,739
Where are you going?

1164
03:05:05,939 --> 03:05:07,960
Manzhouli?

1165
03:05:09,970 --> 03:05:11,819
Any rides going there?

1166
03:05:12,019 --> 03:05:13,340
Any?

1167
03:05:28,220 --> 03:05:30,630
One adult ticket.

1168
03:05:32,680 --> 03:05:35,380
One child.

1169
03:06:24,550 --> 03:06:26,920
You sold me a fake ticket.

1170
03:06:29,970 --> 03:06:32,090
We've never met.

1171
03:06:32,890 --> 03:06:36,210
It's a fake ticket. Gimme my money.

1172
03:06:46,220 --> 03:06:47,710
Where's the ticket?

1173
03:06:47,970 --> 03:06:49,670
Confiscated.

1174
03:06:51,680 --> 03:06:55,630
Well then, how do I tell if
this is a blackmail or not?

1175
03:06:56,930 --> 03:07:01,790
You're lying.
I bought your ticket a couple hours ago.

1176
03:07:05,390 --> 03:07:10,170
There're a million passengers at
the station. You got the wrong guy.

1177
03:07:13,090 --> 03:07:16,920
I know the place where you
get your tickets. Not here.

1178
03:07:36,970 --> 03:07:38,710
What do you want?

1179
03:07:38,970 --> 03:07:42,750
Give me back my money
or I'll call the cops.

1180
03:07:43,970 --> 03:07:48,290
Cops? Well...

1181
03:07:48,760 --> 03:07:53,840
I'm not the person taking your money

1182
03:07:54,510 --> 03:07:57,170
I'm also the victim.

1183
03:07:58,180 --> 03:08:02,040
Follow me and let's get your money back.

1184
03:08:23,640 --> 03:08:26,239
Why did you sell fake tickets?

1185
03:08:26,439 --> 03:08:28,960
Bring the money with you.

1186
03:11:23,260 --> 03:11:25,605
Give me your ID.

1187
03:11:25,805 --> 03:11:28,170
Why?

1188
03:11:31,800 --> 03:11:33,439
Are you stupid?

1189
03:11:33,639 --> 03:11:38,040
You don't need an ID to buy a ticket?

1190
03:12:03,090 --> 03:12:07,250
Now give me half the ticket fare
and I'll get you a new ticket.

1191
03:12:10,050 --> 03:12:15,840
I know it's a fake one.
I want my money back.

1192
03:12:20,470 --> 03:12:24,200
You little shit.
Never gotten on a train before, huh?

1193
03:12:24,400 --> 03:12:29,920
Running away from home is fun, huh?

1194
03:12:48,140 --> 03:12:52,380
You know what? I can kill you.

1195
03:12:53,390 --> 03:12:56,040
Stop there.

1196
03:12:57,090 --> 03:12:58,989
You're Wei Bu?

1197
03:12:59,189 --> 03:13:00,590
No.

1198
03:13:02,760 --> 03:13:04,750
That's a fake name.

1199
03:13:06,930 --> 03:13:10,899
Watch him and call Yu Cheng now.

1200
03:13:11,099 --> 03:13:13,920
He's been looking for him.

1201
03:15:19,470 --> 03:15:21,170
Grandpa.

1202
03:15:24,090 --> 03:15:27,090
I'm taking you to where
I served as a soldier.

1203
03:15:28,340 --> 03:15:30,340
Okay.

1204
03:15:35,840 --> 03:15:39,130
Should we tell Mom?

1205
03:15:42,340 --> 03:15:45,000
Do you want to?

1206
03:15:45,510 --> 03:15:47,290
No.

1207
03:15:53,340 --> 03:15:55,500
Lets go then.

1208
03:17:14,090 --> 03:17:16,500
My brother is dead.

1209
03:17:21,590 --> 03:17:23,540
What are you thinking?

1210
03:17:28,050 --> 03:17:29,880
What?

1211
03:17:32,680 --> 03:17:35,319
If you're standing on a
tall building's balcony.

1212
03:17:35,519 --> 03:17:37,460
what would come up to your mind?

1213
03:17:49,640 --> 03:17:51,380
I would think

1214
03:17:53,800 --> 03:17:56,210
what else I can do.

1215
03:18:05,680 --> 03:18:07,750
What?

1216
03:18:11,720 --> 03:18:14,250
What else I can do.

1217
03:20:42,720 --> 03:20:44,590
Hello.

1218
03:20:45,390 --> 03:20:47,750
Auntie.

1219
03:20:51,550 --> 03:20:53,750
I was there this morning.

1220
03:20:57,470 --> 03:21:00,130
I was at his apartment.

1221
03:21:02,970 --> 03:21:04,880
Right.

1222
03:21:06,840 --> 03:21:08,790
Right.

1223
03:21:09,260 --> 03:21:11,500
I watched him jump off.

1224
03:22:11,930 --> 03:22:14,090
Where are you running off to?

1225
03:22:15,550 --> 03:22:17,170
Manzhouli.

1226
03:22:23,970 --> 03:22:26,000
What for?

1227
03:22:29,800 --> 03:22:31,380
To see an elephant.

1228
03:23:23,890 --> 03:23:25,920
You don't have any money.

1229
03:23:26,340 --> 03:23:28,210
I spent it on a fake ticket.

1230
03:23:31,430 --> 03:23:33,189
You have his ID card?

1231
03:23:33,389 --> 03:23:35,460
Yes.

1232
03:23:36,720 --> 03:23:39,290
Go and buy him a ticket.

1233
03:24:42,390 --> 03:24:44,750
Now you've killed someone.

1234
03:24:45,800 --> 03:24:49,960
Somebody will get you anyway.
I don't have to do it.

1235
03:25:10,720 --> 03:25:12,670
Right.

1236
03:25:31,550 --> 03:25:37,170
I don't like my brother.

1237
03:25:39,970 --> 03:25:42,170
But my parents do.

1238
03:25:43,510 --> 03:25:46,170
Because he's like a little pussy.

1239
03:25:47,300 --> 03:25:51,460
It was an accident.
I didn't intend to hurt him.

1240
03:25:57,340 --> 03:26:01,540
Accident or not, does it matter?

1241
03:26:23,470 --> 03:26:26,040
I don't like him.
But he's still my brother.

1242
03:26:28,140 --> 03:26:31,170
I have to deal with this.

1243
03:26:38,090 --> 03:26:43,710
If my Dad had caught you,
you'd be half dead by now

1244
03:26:44,510 --> 03:26:47,090
and then sent to a juvy.

1245
03:26:49,590 --> 03:26:52,040
That'll be a lot of fun.

1246
03:26:55,640 --> 03:26:57,500
Why do you help me?

1247
03:27:09,050 --> 03:27:12,840
I told you I don't like anybody.

1248
03:27:13,720 --> 03:27:15,775
They all suck.

1249
03:27:15,975 --> 03:27:18,090
Why let me go?

1250
03:27:28,970 --> 03:27:31,540
None of you business.

1251
03:27:33,260 --> 03:27:35,790
You'll get the ticket soon. Just leave.

1252
03:27:39,340 --> 03:27:41,840
I called the police!

1253
03:27:49,180 --> 03:27:53,250
Yu Cheng, let go of him!

1254
03:27:57,510 --> 03:28:01,130
Oh, you are that peeing boy!

1255
03:28:02,890 --> 03:28:08,670
I repeat, Yu Cheng. Let him go!

1256
03:28:17,760 --> 03:28:20,540
I'm not scared of you!

1257
03:28:25,010 --> 03:28:27,210
Stay out of this.

1258
03:28:31,970 --> 03:28:36,540
I didn't tell anyone. Just the police.

1259
03:28:40,470 --> 03:28:42,790
You sent him the location?

1260
03:28:54,010 --> 03:28:56,420
What the hell is that?

1261
03:29:05,430 --> 03:29:10,590
Go! Yu Shuai is dead. I'm not going!

1262
03:29:13,760 --> 03:29:16,340
I'll cover you!

1263
03:29:20,340 --> 03:29:23,040
Oh, he wants to cover you.

1264
03:29:41,090 --> 03:29:45,540
What's that in your hand?
You little snitch.

1265
03:29:51,760 --> 03:29:54,710
Go back to your Mom.
You shouldn't be here.

1266
03:29:55,640 --> 03:30:00,590
Come on! Run!

1267
03:30:04,680 --> 03:30:06,920
Come on!

1268
03:31:09,470 --> 03:31:11,500
He asked for it.

1269
03:31:20,300 --> 03:31:23,090
I didn't upload the video.

1270
03:31:27,510 --> 03:31:29,340
What video?

1271
03:31:30,260 --> 03:31:36,960
The one with Huang
Ling and the vice dean.

1272
03:31:51,300 --> 03:31:53,670
You didn't have to end
up the same way I did.

1273
03:31:58,840 --> 03:32:00,500
You don't get it.

1274
03:32:06,680 --> 03:32:08,880
Get what?

1275
03:32:13,180 --> 03:32:15,340
They are afraid of me.

1276
03:32:17,890 --> 03:32:21,000
Most people won't feel this
proud throughout their lives.

1277
03:32:26,680 --> 03:32:31,500
You made it. They're all afraid of you.

1278
03:32:32,680 --> 03:32:34,750
You're a hero.

1279
03:32:35,010 --> 03:32:36,920
Go.

1280
03:32:40,510 --> 03:32:43,750
You're all going to hell.

1281
03:32:44,510 --> 03:32:47,000
All of you!

1282
03:33:37,090 --> 03:33:39,170
Come on,

1283
03:33:41,760 --> 03:33:46,000
do your homework before you use it!

1284
03:34:08,180 --> 03:34:09,920
The world is just disgusting.

1285
03:37:05,760 --> 03:37:08,040
The train is cancelled.

1286
03:37:59,840 --> 03:38:04,630
The bus can only make
a transfer in Shenyang.

1287
03:38:07,430 --> 03:38:09,920
Then we'll find other ways.

1288
03:38:15,470 --> 03:38:17,340
Shenyang it is.

1289
03:38:21,470 --> 03:38:23,380
Two tickets would do.

1290
03:38:25,510 --> 03:38:26,870
I'm going back.

1291
03:38:27,070 --> 03:38:31,040
You lied to me, Grandpa.

1292
03:38:36,640 --> 03:38:38,380
Where are you going?

1293
03:38:43,180 --> 03:38:49,630
HoMy dog is dead.
No more defense against the nursing home.

1294
03:38:59,340 --> 03:39:00,739
Don't cry.

1295
03:39:00,939 --> 03:39:03,460
Why not?

1296
03:39:07,800 --> 03:39:09,920
Because...

1297
03:39:11,970 --> 03:39:14,710
No reason.

1298
03:39:20,550 --> 03:39:23,290
You can go wherever you want.

1299
03:39:24,590 --> 03:39:26,130
Yes, you can.

1300
03:39:28,840 --> 03:39:34,880
However, you'll find nothing different.

1301
03:39:41,300 --> 03:39:44,540
I learned this when I've
wasted most of my life away.

1302
03:39:45,800 --> 03:39:52,170
So I have to sugar-coat it.

1303
03:39:56,510 --> 03:39:59,500
"There must be a difference."

1304
03:40:00,800 --> 03:40:02,840
Do you understand?

1305
03:40:04,680 --> 03:40:05,790
I do.

1306
03:40:08,340 --> 03:40:10,170
No, you don't.

1307
03:40:12,680 --> 03:40:14,750
You're looking for something else.

1308
03:40:18,220 --> 03:40:21,040
Well the best solution is

1309
03:40:22,680 --> 03:40:25,040
you're right here

1310
03:40:27,760 --> 03:40:31,170
and you look over to the other side.

1311
03:40:33,760 --> 03:40:37,090
You believe that it
must be better than this.

1312
03:40:39,930 --> 03:40:42,090
But you can't go.

1313
03:40:45,640 --> 03:40:47,290
By not going

1314
03:40:48,340 --> 03:40:51,250
you learn to live with it here.

1315
03:41:26,430 --> 03:41:28,500
Let's go and take a look...
