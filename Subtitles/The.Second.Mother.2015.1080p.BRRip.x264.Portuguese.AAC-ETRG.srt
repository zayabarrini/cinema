1
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,000
<i>Fabinho, look who is here!</i>

2
00:02:01,433 --> 00:02:04,172
- Where's Maggie?
- Little Maggie.

3
00:02:04,233 --> 00:02:05,768
Little Maggie, Little Maggie.

4
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:09,333
Maggie, now you're going
to see the greatest champion. Come.

5
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:11,741
The greatest Olympic champion.

6
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,709
Let's get in the pool!

7
00:02:13,766 --> 00:02:15,300
Come to the pool!

8
00:02:15,366 --> 00:02:16,469
Look.

9
00:02:16,533 --> 00:02:18,306
The toy is going to drown.

10
00:02:18,366 --> 00:02:20,344
I want to see you save him.
Go!

11
00:02:20,399 --> 00:02:21,706
- Poor toy.
- It's cold!

12
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:24,471
Cold? Don't be a wimp!

13
00:02:24,533 --> 00:02:26,670
It's warmish. Go!

14
00:02:26,733 --> 00:02:29,040
- Can you watch me?
- I'm watching you!

15
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:31,634
- Swim with me?
- Me? Gee.

16
00:02:32,066 --> 00:02:33,941
I don't have a swimsuit.

17
00:02:42,832 --> 00:02:45,436
- Look.
- I'm looking!

18
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:49,308
Very good!

19
00:02:49,366 --> 00:02:51,139
Convince her.

20
00:02:51,466 --> 00:02:53,966
Say her mommy misses her terribly.

21
00:02:57,466 --> 00:02:59,535
Oh, my love.

22
00:03:00,533 --> 00:03:02,840
Oh, mommy's treasure.

23
00:03:03,533 --> 00:03:05,408
Are you being good?

24
00:03:06,032 --> 00:03:08,237
Obeying Sandra?

25
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,168
Done.

26
00:03:11,633 --> 00:03:14,406
Don't talk to me like that.
I'm your mother!

27
00:03:14,466 --> 00:03:17,034
Talk to me properly.

28
00:03:17,533 --> 00:03:19,840
I called just to hear your voice.

29
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:22,568
OK.

30
00:03:22,633 --> 00:03:25,008
I love you.

31
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,009
Bye.

32
00:03:27,466 --> 00:03:30,501
- Who did you say you love?
- My daughter.

33
00:03:30,832 --> 00:03:34,367
- Where is she?
- Oh, far away.

34
00:03:41,866 --> 00:03:45,504
- And where is my mom?
- She's working, love.

35
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,038
What time is she coming back?

36
00:03:49,099 --> 00:03:50,736
I don't know.

37
00:03:52,533 --> 00:03:54,511
Oh, my God.

38
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:06,033
THE SECOND MOTHER

39
00:04:24,032 --> 00:04:25,533
Fabinho.

40
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:26,799
Fabinho-

41
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:29,003
Go away! Go away, Maggie!

42
00:04:29,066 --> 00:04:31,442
You're going to wake them up!

43
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:37,275
This juice is warm.
I'll fix that.

44
00:04:40,866 --> 00:04:43,276
Gee, how can-

45
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:45,776
I can't believe this.

46
00:04:45,832 --> 00:04:52,607
How can a person get the ice
and put the tray back empty?

47
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:54,507
What a mean person.

48
00:04:55,899 --> 00:04:57,639
Makes me mad!

49
00:04:57,699 --> 00:05:02,871
See, I'm a calm person,
off the charts, super-duper.

50
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:05,004
But when I see this-

51
00:05:05,066 --> 00:05:07,544
Only bad people do such things.

52
00:05:07,899 --> 00:05:09,275
All right.

53
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:10,776
Val.

54
00:05:11,866 --> 00:05:14,071
Remember that Bruna girl
I told you about?

55
00:05:14,132 --> 00:05:15,700
The cute one!

56
00:05:16,099 --> 00:05:17,668
Look.

57
00:05:18,633 --> 00:05:21,440
She dumped me with two texts!
Again!

58
00:05:21,765 --> 00:05:24,403
The world's full of stupid women.

59
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:29,972
Do you think
I'm going to die a virgin?

60
00:05:30,032 --> 00:05:33,169
What a pea-brained idea!
This Bruna girl-

61
00:05:33,233 --> 00:05:35,472
A handsome boy like you.

62
00:05:36,099 --> 00:05:38,667
There's not a boy
like you in Brazil!

63
00:05:39,266 --> 00:05:43,108
With these big blue eyes,
you look like the English prince.

64
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:45,371
What's the youngest one called?

65
00:06:22,699 --> 00:06:25,405
Dr. Carlos, it's 11:00, all right?

66
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:28,774
Will this noisy pandemonium
never end, Antônio?

67
00:06:28,832 --> 00:06:31,538
- I'm not serving lunch!
- Gee, Val!

68
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:36,103
And does he eat?
Take away his booze, then he'll work.

69
00:06:36,832 --> 00:06:40,208
A saint around the house,
a devil at school, dunno.

70
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:41,971
He's biting the other kids.

71
00:06:42,032 --> 00:06:44,135
He hasn't pooped in five days.

72
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:47,405
Of course he hasn't! You only give
this boy Cerelac, Cerelac, Cerelac.

73
00:06:47,765 --> 00:06:51,437
Only Cerelac.
You gotta give him fruits, real food.

74
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:55,467
But he likes it, poor thing!

75
00:06:55,533 --> 00:06:58,840
"He likes it."
Kids can't choose stuff.

76
00:06:58,899 --> 00:07:01,672
You're spoiling Wallace.

77
00:07:03,032 --> 00:07:05,839
Easier said than done.
It's hard to raise a kid on your own.

78
00:07:06,632 --> 00:07:10,372
I want to see him smile
when I'm home.

79
00:07:17,266 --> 00:07:18,971
Sorry, Val.

80
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,273
- Are you finished?
- Yes, thank you.

81
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:30,106
Anything else?

82
00:07:30,866 --> 00:07:33,470
Bring me another guarana, please.

83
00:07:33,799 --> 00:07:36,038
- Is that all?
- Yes, thanks.

84
00:07:36,099 --> 00:07:38,702
My food wasn't any good.
You didn't eat anything.

85
00:07:40,599 --> 00:07:42,100
Anything!

86
00:07:44,799 --> 00:07:47,538
Oh! It was guarana he wanted.

87
00:07:48,299 --> 00:07:49,742
Guarana.

88
00:08:03,299 --> 00:08:05,299
Did you take your medicine,
Dr. Carlos?

89
00:08:05,366 --> 00:08:07,536
I did. Thanks.

90
00:08:09,565 --> 00:08:13,169
- R$ 250 to prescribe serum.
- For God's sake.

91
00:08:13,233 --> 00:08:16,234
- Why have a dog?
- It's for safety!

92
00:08:16,299 --> 00:08:18,970
- C'mon! Safety? A soft dog like that.
- Can I have another one?

93
00:08:19,032 --> 00:08:22,067
She'll lick the thief
and leave wagging her tail.

94
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:25,206
- Only one?
- Give me some onion!

95
00:08:25,266 --> 00:08:27,743
- Two pieces of meat?
- Of course!

96
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:30,936
- I don't eat salad. No purple things.
- Gimme.

97
00:08:32,233 --> 00:08:35,234
Get out, dog!
The dog's licking everything. Gross.

98
00:08:37,499 --> 00:08:39,000
Oh, little baby.

99
00:08:40,899 --> 00:08:42,808
- Maggie-
- Where's the <i>farofa</i>, Val?

100
00:09:01,532 --> 00:09:04,340
Val, I'm leaving.

101
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:05,899
Oh, kid.

102
00:09:07,233 --> 00:09:08,608
Smell it.

103
00:09:10,999 --> 00:09:12,499
Good, right?

104
00:09:14,233 --> 00:09:16,836
- God bless you, honey.
- See you on Wednesday. Amen.

105
00:09:33,499 --> 00:09:36,103
If he said it's not his, then it isn't.

106
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:38,201
- Is it yours, Carlos?
- It's not mine. God forbid.

107
00:09:38,266 --> 00:09:39,868
Val, bring us ice cream, please.

108
00:09:39,932 --> 00:09:41,493
- Of course it's not mine!
- Yes, ma'am.

109
00:09:41,499 --> 00:09:43,205
- It isn't yours, is it?
- Of course not.

110
00:09:43,266 --> 00:09:44,607
We have also smoked pot.

111
00:09:44,665 --> 00:09:47,371
You think your father
and I have never smoked pot?

112
00:09:49,099 --> 00:09:51,304
Of course I have, but-

113
00:09:51,366 --> 00:09:53,809
- OK, Mom.
- I never went crazy, smoking this much.

114
00:09:53,866 --> 00:09:56,434
What can I do
if you don't believe me?

115
00:09:56,499 --> 00:10:00,409
If you're saying it isn't yours,
I believe you.

116
00:10:00,465 --> 00:10:01,966
So you believe it's not his?

117
00:10:02,032 --> 00:10:04,737
We're having a moment here.
Why would he-

118
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:07,436
Right! I'm giving him
the opportunity to talk.

119
00:10:07,499 --> 00:10:10,841
You can smoke pot if you want, my love.
But not this much.

120
00:10:10,899 --> 00:10:12,672
Mom, if it were mine, I'd say it.

121
00:10:12,732 --> 00:10:15,972
- It could be a prank from a friend.
- A friend, sure.

122
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:18,475
Give me some ice cream, please.

123
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:21,902
OK! So, you'll keep telling me
it's not yours?

124
00:10:22,266 --> 00:10:23,766
Then I'm throwing it away.

125
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:26,570
Can I?

126
00:10:26,632 --> 00:10:29,872
If it's not yours, Carlos's or mine,
then I'll trash it.

127
00:10:29,932 --> 00:10:33,375
- Do it.
- Whatever you want.

128
00:10:48,299 --> 00:10:50,106
- More?
- It's delicious.

129
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:51,666
Did you like it, Fabinho?

130
00:10:51,732 --> 00:10:54,369
I'm going to get some syrup.
Excuse me.

131
00:10:56,765 --> 00:10:58,401
Val.

132
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:02,572
- Do we have syrup?
- He said it's not his.

133
00:11:08,066 --> 00:11:10,066
Can you get it for me, please?

134
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:25,336
Shallow-head.

135
00:11:25,398 --> 00:11:28,933
- Window, window, door, bell!
- Stop it.

136
00:11:28,999 --> 00:11:31,306
I'm too big for this.
Stop it, Val.

137
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:34,509
<i>He's so cute</i>

138
00:11:34,565 --> 00:11:37,805
<i>He's so sweet</i>

139
00:11:37,866 --> 00:11:41,037
<i>And he's Val's little boy</i>

140
00:11:41,099 --> 00:11:44,304
<i>He's so cute</i>

141
00:11:45,332 --> 00:11:47,571
What are you doing, Val?

142
00:11:48,233 --> 00:11:50,540
Oh! Finally learned
to clean your ears!

143
00:12:15,966 --> 00:12:17,466
Yes?

144
00:12:18,298 --> 00:12:19,799
Hi?

145
00:12:22,233 --> 00:12:23,733
Hello?

146
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:32,399
Hello!

147
00:12:33,499 --> 00:12:35,000
Who is it?

148
00:12:41,966 --> 00:12:43,466
Hi.

149
00:12:45,332 --> 00:12:48,242
I can't hear. Jéssica?

150
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:51,504
Hi, honey.

151
00:12:52,432 --> 00:12:53,933
Hi.

152
00:12:54,365 --> 00:12:56,173
What is it?

153
00:12:59,066 --> 00:13:00,839
Oh, God.

154
00:13:02,265 --> 00:13:03,971
No way.

155
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:09,041
But to São Paulo?

156
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:13,504
Don't do this to your mom.
You're kidding.

157
00:13:16,699 --> 00:13:19,404
No, no!
I like the idea. It's great.

158
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:22,299
But there's-

159
00:13:22,699 --> 00:13:27,609
But it's too late.
Fabinho already signed up ages ago.

160
00:13:28,832 --> 00:13:30,400
He's also going-

161
00:13:30,765 --> 00:13:32,401
On the Internet?

162
00:13:33,765 --> 00:13:35,401
You can do that?

163
00:14:00,832 --> 00:14:03,332
- I'm leaving.
- Where are you going all dressed up, Val?

164
00:14:03,398 --> 00:14:05,899
Fabinho, mind your own business!

165
00:14:06,465 --> 00:14:08,841
Show some respect!

166
00:14:11,732 --> 00:14:14,266
- Dona Bárbara.
- Hi.

167
00:14:15,232 --> 00:14:18,301
- I have to talk to you, ma'am.
- Smelling good, huh?

168
00:14:18,365 --> 00:14:20,138
- My goodness.
- It's perfume.

169
00:14:20,198 --> 00:14:22,699
Tell me, is the lasagna ready?

170
00:14:22,765 --> 00:14:26,208
It is. It's in the oven.
It was too hot to put it in the freezer.

171
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:27,607
OK then. Thanks, love.

172
00:14:27,665 --> 00:14:30,575
Get here early on Monday.
It's my birthday dinner.

173
00:14:30,632 --> 00:14:32,507
- And you think I would forget?
- OK?

174
00:14:32,565 --> 00:14:34,509
- Thanks, see you.
- And the-

175
00:14:34,565 --> 00:14:37,168
- See you, love.
- Bye.

176
00:14:37,232 --> 00:14:38,938
Get off me, Maggie.

177
00:14:38,999 --> 00:14:41,203
Honestly, Maggie.

178
00:15:20,765 --> 00:15:26,675
When did Pamela come
to live with you?

179
00:15:26,732 --> 00:15:29,539
- Four years.
- Gee! Already?

180
00:15:37,532 --> 00:15:39,601
And is it working out?

181
00:16:14,499 --> 00:16:16,170
Fabinho.

182
00:16:16,232 --> 00:16:18,767
Fabinho, it's almost 7:00.

183
00:16:41,232 --> 00:16:43,039
- Hi.
- Hi.

184
00:16:43,098 --> 00:16:45,167
Excuse me,
we're filming an interview here.

185
00:16:45,232 --> 00:16:47,107
Could you make less noise, please?

186
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:49,640
- Forgive me.
- Thank you.

187
00:17:13,098 --> 00:17:16,565
You are a woman people follow,
a trendsetter.

188
00:17:16,632 --> 00:17:18,132
A little bit.

189
00:17:18,465 --> 00:17:20,238
Define style.

190
00:17:20,965 --> 00:17:23,000
There's no secret to style, you know.

191
00:17:23,065 --> 00:17:25,134
You don't have to make it up.

192
00:17:25,198 --> 00:17:30,165
Style is knowing yourself,
accepting yourself.

193
00:17:30,499 --> 00:17:34,170
And that's why I believe
style is being who you are.

194
00:17:34,232 --> 00:17:37,233
Wonderful.
You really are "Bárbara."

195
00:17:37,298 --> 00:17:39,640
- Thank you, dear.
- Thank you, darling.

196
00:17:39,932 --> 00:17:41,876
- It's been a pleasure.
- My pleasure.

197
00:17:41,932 --> 00:17:44,136
- And happy birthday!
- Thank you so much.

198
00:17:44,198 --> 00:17:45,699
And cut!

199
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:47,937
- Thanks, everyone!
- Thank you!

200
00:17:47,998 --> 00:17:50,340
- Try to come tonight.
- Sure. Thanks!

201
00:17:50,398 --> 00:17:52,842
- For the party. Thank you, Bárbara.
- You're welcome, love.

202
00:17:53,765 --> 00:17:57,800
- Call Janaína when the show is aired.
- Sure, sure.

203
00:17:57,866 --> 00:18:00,275
- We're just going to wrap.
- Take your time.

204
00:18:00,332 --> 00:18:02,071
OK. Thanks.

205
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:06,170
Happy birthday, Dona Bárbara.

206
00:18:07,065 --> 00:18:09,737
- Oh, thanks, Val.
- All the best.

207
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:12,276
I wish you a super-duper year!

208
00:18:12,332 --> 00:18:14,674
I need luck.

209
00:18:14,732 --> 00:18:16,732
Look.
It's not a big deal.

210
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:19,743
You bought me a present, woman?
Thank you.

211
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:22,436
- Can I open it?
- Please do.

212
00:18:22,499 --> 00:18:23,908
Let's see, let's see.

213
00:18:23,965 --> 00:18:25,602
The owner of the store said
it's selling well.

214
00:18:25,665 --> 00:18:27,700
- Really? Selling well?
- Very well!

215
00:18:27,765 --> 00:18:30,140
Look at that!

216
00:18:30,198 --> 00:18:32,574
- Wow!
- It matches your outfit.

217
00:18:32,632 --> 00:18:35,166
Look how beautiful. Awesome.

218
00:18:35,232 --> 00:18:37,210
- Do you like it?
- I do.

219
00:18:37,265 --> 00:18:42,573
So let's put it away
and save it for a special occasion.

220
00:18:42,632 --> 00:18:45,803
- OK.
- You can take it and put it away.

221
00:18:47,198 --> 00:18:50,903
Dona Bárbara,
I really need to talk to you.

222
00:18:50,965 --> 00:18:52,307
Tell me.

223
00:18:52,665 --> 00:18:54,336
Jéssica called me on Thursday.

224
00:18:54,398 --> 00:18:56,137
- Who's Jéssica?
- My daughter.

225
00:18:56,198 --> 00:18:57,642
Oh! Your daughter!

226
00:18:57,699 --> 00:19:01,165
- And Jéssica wants to-
- Wait. Just a minute, Val.

227
00:19:01,232 --> 00:19:02,574
Hello?

228
00:19:02,998 --> 00:19:04,499
Hi, Léo, how are you?

229
00:19:04,965 --> 00:19:06,466
I don't know, love!

230
00:19:06,532 --> 00:19:09,907
No-
Call Janaína and check with her.

231
00:19:09,965 --> 00:19:11,341
OK? I don't-

232
00:19:11,665 --> 00:19:13,301
It's true.

233
00:19:13,365 --> 00:19:16,036
Thank you, dear.

234
00:19:16,098 --> 00:19:19,076
Bye! Bye.

235
00:19:20,965 --> 00:19:23,000
So, Jéssica...

236
00:19:24,131 --> 00:19:26,131
wants to come to São Paulo
to stay with me.

237
00:19:26,198 --> 00:19:30,301
You don't say!
That's great, Val!

238
00:19:30,365 --> 00:19:33,036
- What is she going to do here?
- Apply for university.

239
00:19:33,098 --> 00:19:35,235
Wow!
What does she want to study?

240
00:19:35,898 --> 00:19:37,876
- I don't know, ma'am.
- No?

241
00:19:37,931 --> 00:19:39,432
No, ma'am.

242
00:19:39,499 --> 00:19:43,238
I wanted to check with you if,
just at the beginning...

243
00:19:43,298 --> 00:19:47,709
she could stay here until-
until we find a place.

244
00:19:47,765 --> 00:19:50,606
Of course she can!

245
00:19:50,665 --> 00:19:53,801
You're almost family!

246
00:19:53,865 --> 00:19:55,673
You helped me raise Fabinho!

247
00:19:55,732 --> 00:19:57,936
Such an unresolved issue.

248
00:19:57,998 --> 00:20:00,670
When was the last time you saw her?

249
00:20:00,732 --> 00:20:02,232
More than 10 years ago.

250
00:20:02,765 --> 00:20:04,743
God!

251
00:20:04,798 --> 00:20:06,435
At first, I couldn't visit her.

252
00:20:06,499 --> 00:20:09,840
You remember the problems
with the father, so I couldn't.

253
00:20:10,398 --> 00:20:13,205
But even after I got rid
of that evil spirit...

254
00:20:13,265 --> 00:20:15,675
I'd call her and call her...

255
00:20:15,998 --> 00:20:19,135
but she never wanted to talk to me.

256
00:20:19,198 --> 00:20:22,335
She was there,
they told her it was me...

257
00:20:22,398 --> 00:20:24,603
and she would say,
"I'm out! I'm out!"

258
00:20:24,665 --> 00:20:26,506
I hadn't spoken to her
in over three years.

259
00:20:26,565 --> 00:20:28,906
It was weird her calling
saying she wanted to come.

260
00:20:29,965 --> 00:20:33,875
- Are you looking for a place for the two of you?
- Yes.

261
00:20:33,931 --> 00:20:36,807
I'm looking for a cot to rent.

262
00:20:36,865 --> 00:20:38,741
I'm just asking.
It's not that I want-

263
00:20:38,798 --> 00:20:41,504
She can stay
for as long as you need.

264
00:20:42,465 --> 00:20:46,136
I appreciate it. I'm going
to get a mattress to put in my room.

265
00:20:46,198 --> 00:20:49,574
Get a nice one.
I insist on paying.

266
00:20:49,632 --> 00:20:51,439
Let me know how much
and I'll give you the money.

267
00:20:51,499 --> 00:20:54,102
You're too kind, Dona Bárbara.
You're like a mother to me.

268
00:20:54,165 --> 00:20:56,575
Mom? Oh, come on.
Don't forget to make the mousse cake, OK?

269
00:20:56,632 --> 00:20:58,166
Double the recipe.

270
00:20:58,232 --> 00:20:59,971
See you, love. Bye.

271
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:01,532
Bye.

272
00:21:07,365 --> 00:21:09,968
"TRIX Home.

273
00:21:10,432 --> 00:21:14,274
Includes six espresso mugs
with saucers...

274
00:21:14,332 --> 00:21:16,173
plus one tray plus one thermos."

275
00:21:16,831 --> 00:21:18,831
Let me see how it works.

276
00:21:19,165 --> 00:21:20,904
You put them like this.

277
00:21:21,632 --> 00:21:23,802
But it's mismatched.

278
00:21:24,898 --> 00:21:28,865
One black, one white.

279
00:21:29,532 --> 00:21:31,476
White.

280
00:21:32,098 --> 00:21:33,939
Black.

281
00:21:33,998 --> 00:21:35,635
Another black.

282
00:21:36,698 --> 00:21:38,301
Done!

283
00:21:38,565 --> 00:21:40,236
Beautiful.

284
00:21:40,298 --> 00:21:41,832
And here-

285
00:21:43,398 --> 00:21:45,205
Oh! It's mismatched.

286
00:21:45,931 --> 00:21:49,307
White.
This is how they like it.

287
00:21:49,898 --> 00:21:51,773
So modern!

288
00:21:57,198 --> 00:21:59,107
Gee. What about the thermos?

289
00:22:00,165 --> 00:22:01,666
Where should it-

290
00:22:04,265 --> 00:22:06,607
What about the thermos?

291
00:22:06,665 --> 00:22:08,006
Gee.

292
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:13,167
The thermos is-

293
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:15,204
So I'll have to take one away.

294
00:22:17,198 --> 00:22:19,540
But if I lay the thermos...

295
00:22:20,499 --> 00:22:22,238
I'll have to take out a mug.

296
00:22:23,098 --> 00:22:25,633
It's the only way.

297
00:22:27,532 --> 00:22:29,907
But that's not presentable.

298
00:22:31,198 --> 00:22:33,198
In the picture-

299
00:22:33,698 --> 00:22:35,108
There is the thermos!

300
00:22:35,165 --> 00:22:38,371
It must be set with the thermos!

301
00:22:40,398 --> 00:22:42,069
I'm hiding this mug!

302
00:23:41,432 --> 00:23:43,773
Only one, all right, Skull?

303
00:23:44,198 --> 00:23:46,698
- Are you saying no to your fiancé, Val?
- Only one!

304
00:23:46,764 --> 00:23:49,174
Have some respect
and go get a haircut!

305
00:24:29,098 --> 00:24:32,564
- What is it, Dona Bárbara?
- Val, for God's sake! Not this one.

306
00:24:32,631 --> 00:24:35,473
Where did this come from?
I said we'd take this to Guarujá.

307
00:24:35,531 --> 00:24:38,873
Get that white wooden one...

308
00:24:38,931 --> 00:24:40,966
the one I brought from Sweden.
Please.

309
00:24:41,031 --> 00:24:43,339
But you said to save it
for a special occasion.

310
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:44,739
Yeah, OK.

311
00:25:48,564 --> 00:25:50,065
Val?

312
00:25:51,965 --> 00:25:54,273
Dear Lord!

313
00:26:04,098 --> 00:26:06,133
A little gift for you.

314
00:26:06,431 --> 00:26:09,308
You look so beautiful, beautiful,
beautiful, beautiful!

315
00:26:09,365 --> 00:26:10,774
Thanks.

316
00:26:10,831 --> 00:26:12,740
Oh, my God.

317
00:26:13,098 --> 00:26:14,734
Look at you!

318
00:26:15,498 --> 00:26:18,533
- Are you hungry, honey?
- No, I'm cool.

319
00:26:18,598 --> 00:26:20,304
Did you get scared?

320
00:26:21,298 --> 00:26:25,208
No. I have something here
for you from Sandra.

321
00:26:28,098 --> 00:26:30,575
- Do you want it now?
- What's this?

322
00:26:31,165 --> 00:26:34,006
- Let me give it to you before I forget.
- Oh, my love.

323
00:26:34,065 --> 00:26:37,009
She asked me to give it to you.
It's coconut candy.

324
00:26:37,065 --> 00:26:39,702
- I love this candy!
- It smells good.

325
00:26:40,464 --> 00:26:43,341
I know which one it is.
The one she often sends, the "jawbreaker."

326
00:26:44,165 --> 00:26:45,471
- Let's go?
- Yes.

327
00:26:45,531 --> 00:26:47,271
Let's go home, this way.

328
00:26:47,698 --> 00:26:50,403
- Don't you want to eat anything?
- No, I'm cool.

329
00:26:50,464 --> 00:26:53,341
Are you sure?
Can I carry something for you?

330
00:26:53,397 --> 00:26:55,705
- Or push?
- No, I've got the cart.

331
00:26:56,731 --> 00:26:59,039
You look so nice.

332
00:27:07,332 --> 00:27:08,832
And your father?

333
00:27:09,865 --> 00:27:11,365
What about him?

334
00:27:12,498 --> 00:27:14,942
Well, your father, how is he?

335
00:27:16,898 --> 00:27:18,933
He's not talking to me.

336
00:27:18,998 --> 00:27:20,942
What did you do?

337
00:27:22,831 --> 00:27:24,070
It's nonsense.

338
00:27:24,131 --> 00:27:27,597
If he's not talking to you,
it isn't nonsense.

339
00:27:38,564 --> 00:27:41,133
- Do you like it?
- Yeah.

340
00:27:41,198 --> 00:27:45,074
- What is this place?
- Marginal Tietê.

341
00:27:45,131 --> 00:27:47,972
- The Tietê River.
- I know it!

342
00:27:50,598 --> 00:27:54,940
This is Largo da Batata.

343
00:27:56,165 --> 00:27:58,143
I've heard of it.

344
00:27:58,198 --> 00:28:01,142
They say there are more people from
the Northeast here than in the Northeast itself.

345
00:28:01,198 --> 00:28:02,766
That was before!

346
00:28:02,831 --> 00:28:07,775
But now to build a subway station here,
look, they've concreted everywhere.

347
00:28:07,831 --> 00:28:10,468
I don't know what this is.
Surely not a square.

348
00:28:10,531 --> 00:28:12,032
There isn't a single bush.

349
00:28:12,098 --> 00:28:14,701
They've concreted everywhere.

350
00:28:14,764 --> 00:28:16,969
We used to dance <i>forró</i> here.

351
00:28:17,031 --> 00:28:21,169
Lots of people, bars,
great stores. But now-

352
00:28:21,232 --> 00:28:23,334
- Did you use to come here?
- I did!

353
00:28:23,397 --> 00:28:25,432
Raimunda and I.

354
00:28:25,498 --> 00:28:28,204
Look at that. What is that?
It's not a square!

355
00:28:29,664 --> 00:28:31,767
It's not-
I don't know what it is.

356
00:28:31,831 --> 00:28:34,241
How long until we get there?

357
00:28:34,564 --> 00:28:37,940
Around 10 minutes.

358
00:28:40,297 --> 00:28:44,106
They're dying to meet you.
Really looking forward to it.

359
00:28:45,397 --> 00:28:46,898
Who?

360
00:28:46,965 --> 00:28:49,374
Dona Bárbara, Dr. Carlos...

361
00:28:50,764 --> 00:28:52,435
Fabinho.

362
00:28:52,498 --> 00:28:54,067
The whole gang.

363
00:28:58,764 --> 00:29:01,367
We can go there some other time.

364
00:29:01,731 --> 00:29:03,675
No, we're going now.

365
00:29:05,397 --> 00:29:07,807
But I just got here, Val. I'm tired.

366
00:29:07,865 --> 00:29:11,274
We can go some other time.

367
00:29:11,331 --> 00:29:14,071
No. We're going now.

368
00:29:15,098 --> 00:29:17,098
I live there.

369
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:20,499
What do you mean, you live there?

370
00:29:21,297 --> 00:29:23,536
Are you taking me
to your bosses' home?

371
00:29:24,131 --> 00:29:27,734
I live where I work. I've told you.

372
00:29:28,764 --> 00:29:31,174
You live in their back room?

373
00:29:33,364 --> 00:29:35,001
You're gonna love Fabinho.

374
00:29:35,065 --> 00:29:38,270
No, Val, for God's sake.
I can't believe this.

375
00:29:41,631 --> 00:29:43,041
Calm down, calm down.

376
00:29:43,098 --> 00:29:45,007
You're taking me
to someone else's home.

377
00:29:48,098 --> 00:29:52,065
So, this is my place.

378
00:29:53,698 --> 00:29:55,198
See?

379
00:29:55,764 --> 00:29:58,799
There's a TV
and everything in place.

380
00:29:59,531 --> 00:30:03,498
The bed. Oh, let me show you
the brand new mattress...

381
00:30:03,564 --> 00:30:06,474
she had me buy for you.
First-class.

382
00:30:07,297 --> 00:30:08,741
Here.

383
00:30:08,798 --> 00:30:13,140
The sheets and towels,
everything you need. All right?

384
00:30:13,197 --> 00:30:15,436
I don't know if the mattress will fit.

385
00:30:15,764 --> 00:30:17,605
Of course it will.

386
00:30:18,331 --> 00:30:20,502
Let's air the room.

387
00:30:21,531 --> 00:30:24,532
- Let me pull it out.
- We can do it later.

388
00:30:24,598 --> 00:30:27,439
No. See? Done!

389
00:30:27,865 --> 00:30:30,036
Now we just need to make the bed.

390
00:30:30,098 --> 00:30:34,235
Now, you're looking at it.
Do you like it?

391
00:30:34,297 --> 00:30:37,639
This is a citrus squeezer.

392
00:30:37,998 --> 00:30:39,839
This is a mixer.

393
00:30:39,898 --> 00:30:42,103
This is a fan.

394
00:30:42,164 --> 00:30:44,540
A good one, unlike this one here.

395
00:30:44,598 --> 00:30:47,804
I bought all of this
for our new home.

396
00:30:47,865 --> 00:30:49,138
Right.

397
00:30:51,498 --> 00:30:53,567
Where am I going to study here?

398
00:30:53,865 --> 00:30:56,638
They're here.
They're here!

399
00:31:30,998 --> 00:31:32,805
Finished, Fabinho?

400
00:31:33,564 --> 00:31:35,337
- Fabinho?
- Yeah.

401
00:31:35,764 --> 00:31:37,673
- Are you eating more, Carlos?
- No, no.

402
00:31:37,731 --> 00:31:40,106
- Val!
- Yes?

403
00:31:40,164 --> 00:31:42,199
You can clear the table, please.

404
00:31:42,831 --> 00:31:44,467
I'm coming.

405
00:31:51,965 --> 00:31:54,636
- Excuse me.
- Thanks, Val.

406
00:31:55,431 --> 00:31:58,841
- Is she here?
- Jéssica? Yes, she is.

407
00:31:59,297 --> 00:32:01,741
- Let me get this, Fabinho.
- Bring her here!

408
00:32:01,798 --> 00:32:03,104
- I'll go get her.
- Thanks, Val.

409
00:32:03,164 --> 00:32:05,040
- I'm curious.
- I'll call her.

410
00:32:07,965 --> 00:32:10,272
- Jéssica?
- She's so happy.

411
00:32:10,331 --> 00:32:12,003
How sweet.

412
00:32:15,564 --> 00:32:17,064
Come, honey!

413
00:32:19,364 --> 00:32:20,899
Here, Dona Bárbara.

414
00:32:20,965 --> 00:32:23,101
- Look how pretty!
- Jéssica.

415
00:32:24,197 --> 00:32:27,232
- These are for you.
- Oh, my God.

416
00:32:27,297 --> 00:32:29,935
- Thank you.
- Welcome, nice to meet you!

417
00:32:29,998 --> 00:32:32,373
- You shouldn't have!
- Thank you.

418
00:32:32,431 --> 00:32:37,136
We like your mom a lot.
She's very important to us and so are you.

419
00:32:37,197 --> 00:32:38,800
- How are you, Jéssica?
- Make yourself comfortable.

420
00:32:38,865 --> 00:32:41,172
This is Dr. Carlos, Fabinho.

421
00:32:41,231 --> 00:32:43,470
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

422
00:32:43,531 --> 00:32:45,440
Did you know São Paulo?

423
00:32:46,064 --> 00:32:50,531
Only by pictures, the Internet, movies.

424
00:32:50,865 --> 00:32:53,240
She speaks like Val
when she first got here.

425
00:32:54,464 --> 00:32:56,601
- What's this?
- Very similar.

426
00:32:57,130 --> 00:32:59,631
Tell them, Jéssica.
She brought coconut candy.

427
00:32:59,698 --> 00:33:04,301
- Wow. Well, thank you.
- Actually, we call it "jawbreaker."

428
00:33:04,364 --> 00:33:07,570
- I'm gonna have some.
- No, I won't even-

429
00:33:07,631 --> 00:33:10,234
I can't even get close to it.
I'll get fat just by looking at it.

430
00:33:10,297 --> 00:33:11,866
- This is delicious.
- Looking good.

431
00:33:11,931 --> 00:33:13,272
Delicious.

432
00:33:13,664 --> 00:33:16,403
Your mom told us you're
here to apply for university.

433
00:33:16,464 --> 00:33:18,533
- Right.
- What do you want to study?

434
00:33:18,598 --> 00:33:20,906
- Architecture.
- Really?

435
00:33:20,965 --> 00:33:23,238
- At FAU?
- Yeah.

436
00:33:24,598 --> 00:33:26,576
What's the problem, Dona Bárbara?

437
00:33:26,631 --> 00:33:29,268
It's just that FAU is one
of the toughest colleges to get in.

438
00:33:29,331 --> 00:33:31,900
- Is it tough, Dona Bárbara?
- There's a lot of competition.

439
00:33:32,297 --> 00:33:35,070
- So I heard.
- But was school any good there?

440
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:38,768
The education there?
No, not really.

441
00:33:38,831 --> 00:33:40,331
Poor thing!

442
00:33:40,397 --> 00:33:43,068
But I've always had help.

443
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:45,665
I met a history teacher...

444
00:33:45,731 --> 00:33:47,834
João Emanuel,
who helped me a lot, all of us.

445
00:33:47,898 --> 00:33:49,966
How did he help?

446
00:33:50,997 --> 00:33:54,032
He was very critical about things...

447
00:33:54,097 --> 00:33:59,007
so he told us some very
important things, made us think.

448
00:33:59,064 --> 00:34:02,736
He turned our brains on,
set up a theater group.

449
00:34:03,164 --> 00:34:05,164
And why architecture?

450
00:34:07,997 --> 00:34:10,066
Why did you choose it?

451
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:13,537
There are a lot of reasons.

452
00:34:13,598 --> 00:34:17,235
I've always liked to draw.
It's easy for me.

453
00:34:17,664 --> 00:34:20,574
And my Uncle Adejar is a contractor.

454
00:34:20,631 --> 00:34:23,938
Adejar, Adevicto and Ademar,
the three brothers.

455
00:34:24,364 --> 00:34:29,172
I used to help him,
and I also learned a bunch of things.

456
00:34:29,231 --> 00:34:33,039
I drew the plan of a house
that even got built.

457
00:34:33,097 --> 00:34:35,302
- Wow! Very impressive.
- Very good.

458
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:37,433
I think it's important for me
to have a diploma.

459
00:34:37,498 --> 00:34:39,339
- Sure.
- And I believe architecture...

460
00:34:39,397 --> 00:34:41,636
is an instrument of social change.

461
00:34:41,698 --> 00:34:44,141
See?
Our country is really changing.

462
00:34:44,197 --> 00:34:46,936
- Cool.
- Very good.

463
00:34:47,698 --> 00:34:49,334
Good luck.

464
00:34:55,731 --> 00:34:58,868
The house is somewhat modernist,
isn't it?

465
00:34:59,331 --> 00:35:01,400
But not exactly.

466
00:35:01,464 --> 00:35:03,840
What a smart daughter, huh, Val?

467
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:08,534
You have to see her grades.
All straight As!

468
00:35:08,598 --> 00:35:11,166
- Val, can you bring me a glass of water?
- Yes, sir.

469
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:15,836
I'm not smart. I'm curious.

470
00:35:15,897 --> 00:35:17,807
Isn't it the same thing?

471
00:35:20,164 --> 00:35:23,301
I really wanted to read this book here.
I was looking for it.

472
00:35:23,364 --> 00:35:26,604
Do you have time to read
apart from studying?

473
00:35:28,197 --> 00:35:30,197
- I like to read.
- Thanks, Val.

474
00:35:31,264 --> 00:35:33,572
So take it and read it.

475
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:35,704
- Can I?
- Sure.

476
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:37,736
Come see the pool.

477
00:35:47,464 --> 00:35:50,635
Val, can you turn on
the pool lights, please?

478
00:35:58,164 --> 00:36:00,199
The most beautiful thing, isn't it?

479
00:36:00,664 --> 00:36:02,232
It is.

480
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:07,699
I like to read too.

481
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:11,065
Fabinho is also a very good student.
Aren't you, Fabinho?

482
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:13,540
- Isn't he, Dr. Carlos?
- He is.

483
00:36:19,531 --> 00:36:21,202
Let's see Fabinho's?

484
00:36:38,564 --> 00:36:40,508
They're all suites.

485
00:36:43,164 --> 00:36:46,699
Look, Jéssica.
Fabinho and Mickey.

486
00:36:47,197 --> 00:36:49,436
Fabinho was this big
when I arrived here.

487
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:51,498
So cute!

488
00:36:51,564 --> 00:36:53,508
Famous Fabinho.

489
00:36:53,564 --> 00:36:55,599
Famous Jéssica.

490
00:36:57,231 --> 00:36:59,072
What about that door?

491
00:37:01,231 --> 00:37:02,833
It's the guest room.

492
00:37:02,897 --> 00:37:05,102
Yeah, the guest room.

493
00:37:06,097 --> 00:37:08,041
Do you want to see it?

494
00:37:25,997 --> 00:37:27,498
Another suite?

495
00:37:31,664 --> 00:37:34,574
Look!
What a comfortable mattress!

496
00:37:34,631 --> 00:37:37,199
Jéssica, get up.

497
00:37:37,264 --> 00:37:38,764
I'm sorry, Dr. Carlos.

498
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:41,274
A great mattress like this
and no one sleeps in here?

499
00:37:41,664 --> 00:37:45,164
- Because it's the guest room.
- So this is where I'm staying!

500
00:37:45,231 --> 00:37:47,436
- What? Have you lost your mind?
- Do you want to stay here?

501
00:37:47,498 --> 00:37:49,100
- For God's sake, for God's sake!
- It's OK.

502
00:37:49,164 --> 00:37:50,869
- For God's sake!
- Do you?

503
00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:53,306
- I think it would be good for studying.
- Bárbara!

504
00:37:53,364 --> 00:37:55,364
No, Jéssica.
You're staying with me in my room.

505
00:37:56,830 --> 00:37:59,672
- What it's it?
- Jéssica is staying here.

506
00:38:01,064 --> 00:38:02,064
OK.

507
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:05,631
She should stay in my room,
as we had already agreed.

508
00:38:05,698 --> 00:38:09,835
Dona Bárbara bought a brand
new mattress, a very good one.

509
00:38:09,897 --> 00:38:13,205
- Here's the remote control.
- It's still wrapped.

510
00:38:13,264 --> 00:38:15,935
Please, Dr. Carlos,
she can stay with me.

511
00:38:15,997 --> 00:38:17,804
- She won't disturb anyone.
- Make yourself comfortable.

512
00:38:17,864 --> 00:38:20,138
OK, I'm going to get my things.

513
00:38:20,197 --> 00:38:22,765
Jéssica, stop being pushy! Pushy!

514
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:24,774
But he's inviting me, Val.

515
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:26,590
Because you said,
"That's where I'm staying!"

516
00:38:42,164 --> 00:38:45,506
Oh, it's you.

517
00:38:46,631 --> 00:38:48,506
I can't sleep, Val.

518
00:38:48,564 --> 00:38:50,905
Oh, no, Fabinho. I'm tired.

519
00:38:50,964 --> 00:38:54,272
- OK, but I'm going to sleep here, OK?
- OK, but we're not going to chat...

520
00:38:54,331 --> 00:38:56,400
'cause tomorrow I wake up early.

521
00:38:58,397 --> 00:39:00,033
What's wrong with you?

522
00:39:00,797 --> 00:39:04,935
Dunno, I can't sleep.
I'm staying here with you.

523
00:39:08,464 --> 00:39:10,203
Up here, like this.

524
00:39:10,663 --> 00:39:12,141
Fabinho.

525
00:39:13,531 --> 00:39:14,940
What?

526
00:39:17,097 --> 00:39:18,802
What about Jéssica?

527
00:39:20,697 --> 00:39:22,607
Jéssica what?

528
00:39:23,197 --> 00:39:25,072
What did you think of her?

529
00:39:27,231 --> 00:39:28,902
A bit strange.

530
00:39:31,464 --> 00:39:33,203
What do you mean?

531
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:37,331
I don't know. Too sure of herself.

532
00:39:38,663 --> 00:39:40,971
You're right.
She's too sure of herself.

533
00:39:41,763 --> 00:39:43,934
You're right. Sure of herself.

534
00:39:43,997 --> 00:39:46,100
With those eyes of hers...

535
00:39:47,397 --> 00:39:50,840
looking at everyone
as if she were the president.

536
00:39:57,097 --> 00:39:58,597
Fabinho?

537
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:00,540
What?

538
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:22,431
Val?

539
00:40:39,197 --> 00:40:40,731
Val?

540
00:41:03,697 --> 00:41:05,198
Good morning.

541
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:08,231
Good morning.

542
00:41:11,663 --> 00:41:13,198
Were you with your mother?

543
00:41:13,797 --> 00:41:16,036
- I haven't seen her today.
- No?

544
00:41:16,097 --> 00:41:18,234
Do you know where she could be?

545
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:20,474
She must be sleeping.

546
00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:23,872
I went to her room and knocked,
but she didn't answer.

547
00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:34,074
Have you had breakfast?

548
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:36,470
I've just woken up.

549
00:41:44,763 --> 00:41:46,570
Do you want to eat?

550
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:48,131
Let me see.

551
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:51,438
Excuse me.
Look, we have bread.

552
00:41:53,097 --> 00:41:55,768
White bread, whole wheat bread.

553
00:41:56,097 --> 00:41:58,132
Let me get a mat for you.

554
00:42:01,331 --> 00:42:02,831
Have a seat.

555
00:42:02,897 --> 00:42:05,000
What do you want to drink?

556
00:42:08,231 --> 00:42:11,606
- What kind of juice is that?
- Sweet lime.

557
00:42:12,964 --> 00:42:15,999
- You're not having it?
- I can make you some. Do you want it?

558
00:42:17,130 --> 00:42:18,630
I do.

559
00:42:49,097 --> 00:42:51,097
Did you like it?

560
00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:54,732
- Yeah.
- Tasty, right?

561
00:42:54,797 --> 00:42:56,433
It's good for you.

562
00:43:07,064 --> 00:43:08,871
Damn it.

563
00:43:08,930 --> 00:43:11,567
Dona Bárbara,
this has never happened to me.

564
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:14,574
I think the alarm didn't go off.
I overslept.

565
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:16,801
- It's OK.
- What do you want? A piece of toast?

566
00:43:16,864 --> 00:43:19,308
- I've already had breakfast.
- I'm going to make you some toast.

567
00:43:19,364 --> 00:43:22,137
- It's OK. I'm leaving, Val.
- Dear God, Dona Bárbara.

568
00:43:22,197 --> 00:43:24,141
Your daughter loved the jam.

569
00:43:24,997 --> 00:43:26,565
Bye.

570
00:43:26,630 --> 00:43:28,131
What is this?

571
00:43:33,897 --> 00:43:37,171
Jéssica, who set the table?

572
00:43:37,630 --> 00:43:39,131
Bárbara did.

573
00:43:39,197 --> 00:43:42,504
It's not Bárbara.
It's Dona Bárbara.

574
00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:46,131
Come on, "Bárbara"!

575
00:43:46,197 --> 00:43:48,640
And you can't sit at their table.

576
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:52,108
- And which one is their table?
- This one.

577
00:43:52,797 --> 00:43:56,605
And where's the other one I can't see?
Am I supposed to eat standing up?

578
00:43:56,663 --> 00:43:58,300
She told me to sit here.

579
00:43:58,363 --> 00:43:59,898
Get out of there.

580
00:43:59,964 --> 00:44:01,999
I'm eating, wait.

581
00:44:06,331 --> 00:44:09,968
- Get out, Jéssica.
- I'm eating, Val. Let me finish.

582
00:44:10,497 --> 00:44:13,964
Oh, Lord.
What were you thinking?

583
00:44:14,763 --> 00:44:18,037
The maid's daughter sitting
at the bosses' table?

584
00:44:18,497 --> 00:44:20,634
They are not my bosses, Val.

585
00:44:21,563 --> 00:44:24,507
Hey. "Val"?
Can't you call me "Mom"?

586
00:44:24,930 --> 00:44:27,635
- I can.
- Much obliged.

587
00:44:33,997 --> 00:44:35,941
Done.

588
00:44:36,530 --> 00:44:39,099
Holy Mary,
I've never seen such a thing.

589
00:44:39,830 --> 00:44:42,069
You're crazy, totally clueless.

590
00:44:48,964 --> 00:44:51,373
Leave that there.
I'll do it. Go. Go!

591
00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:53,840
- I'm going to study in my room.
- Yes, go.

592
00:45:11,597 --> 00:45:13,269
Hi, honey.

593
00:45:15,130 --> 00:45:17,108
What do you want, love?

594
00:45:18,330 --> 00:45:21,070
- Juice.
- Don't you want a sandwich?

595
00:45:22,130 --> 00:45:23,267
I do.

596
00:45:34,864 --> 00:45:37,398
Put the ladder by the plant.

597
00:45:41,830 --> 00:45:44,240
Now. Quickly, Edna!

598
00:45:47,697 --> 00:45:48,936
Here.

599
00:45:49,897 --> 00:45:52,000
Pay attention. Pay attention.

600
00:45:52,064 --> 00:45:55,701
Pretend you're pruning.
I'll pretend I'm watering.

601
00:45:56,130 --> 00:45:57,869
And you spy on her.

602
00:45:58,864 --> 00:46:01,933
Pretend you're pruning.
I'll pretend I'm watering.

603
00:46:03,197 --> 00:46:05,038
Got it? Got it?

604
00:46:05,097 --> 00:46:08,041
Got it, but this ladder is wobbly.
Hold it for me.

605
00:46:11,097 --> 00:46:13,836
- She's reading.
- What is she doing?

606
00:46:13,897 --> 00:46:16,397
- She's reading. She's got a book.
- Reading?

607
00:46:16,463 --> 00:46:19,135
- She's reading.
- She must be studying then.

608
00:46:19,396 --> 00:46:20,999
She could be sleeping.
I can't see her face.

609
00:46:21,064 --> 00:46:23,371
She's studying. She's studying.

610
00:46:23,430 --> 00:46:26,533
Now she's up.
She's laying on the bed.

611
00:46:26,597 --> 00:46:29,768
Pretend you're pruning.
I'll pretend I'm watering.

612
00:46:33,197 --> 00:46:36,606
- And now, what is she doing?
- I don't know if she's going to sleep.

613
00:46:36,663 --> 00:46:39,223
- She got the book!
- Don't let her see you. Don't make her turn.

614
00:46:39,263 --> 00:46:42,037
- This girl is a little-
- Get down, get down.

615
00:46:42,097 --> 00:46:44,768
The whole day with a book,
it's easy to go crazy.

616
00:46:44,830 --> 00:46:47,273
Move the ladder, c'mon!
Gimme, gimme.

617
00:46:59,763 --> 00:47:01,297
Jéssica?

618
00:47:05,097 --> 00:47:06,665
Just a minute.

619
00:47:06,730 --> 00:47:09,106
- It's Mom, Jéssica.
- Wait.

620
00:47:13,864 --> 00:47:18,002
Look, this is Edna.
She works here with me.

621
00:47:18,064 --> 00:47:20,940
She's my little sister here
in São Paulo.

622
00:47:21,730 --> 00:47:23,469
- Nice to meet you.
- Everything OK?

623
00:47:24,997 --> 00:47:27,134
- She looks like you.
- Really?

624
00:47:27,630 --> 00:47:31,097
You think, do you?
I think she looks just like her father.

625
00:47:31,630 --> 00:47:34,006
Pretty, but skinny. Look.

626
00:47:36,130 --> 00:47:41,074
So, Edna needs
to get in there for a while...

627
00:47:41,396 --> 00:47:43,533
to vacuum the floor,
tidy up the bedroom.

628
00:47:43,597 --> 00:47:48,064
Don't worry, I've already tidied it up.
All is organized.

629
00:47:48,830 --> 00:47:49,864
So-

630
00:47:49,930 --> 00:47:53,203
But, Dona Bárbara is...

631
00:47:54,196 --> 00:47:57,800
very fussy about it.
I have to vacuum the room.

632
00:47:58,730 --> 00:48:01,072
- She's going to look at it later.
- Is she really?

633
00:48:01,129 --> 00:48:02,266
Sure, sure.

634
00:48:02,330 --> 00:48:04,137
So get your things and let's go upstairs.

635
00:48:04,196 --> 00:48:07,663
I'm studying, Val.
It's all set, the books and everything.

636
00:48:07,730 --> 00:48:11,503
No, get your books and come study
in the kitchen with me.

637
00:48:11,563 --> 00:48:15,302
- It's breezy up there.
- Edna is going to vacuum the room.

638
00:48:15,997 --> 00:48:18,167
- Let me get the rest of it, wait.
- Do that.

639
00:48:21,230 --> 00:48:24,072
I don't know which name is worse,
Claudiomir or Pingulim.

640
00:48:24,129 --> 00:48:27,403
I didn't like any,
but Pingulim sounds better.

641
00:48:27,930 --> 00:48:29,635
- Don't you think?
- Poor thing.

642
00:48:30,196 --> 00:48:32,697
- I think so.
- They are both awful.

643
00:48:32,763 --> 00:48:34,104
I know.

644
00:48:35,730 --> 00:48:37,639
So, are you enjoying São Paulo?

645
00:48:38,396 --> 00:48:40,135
I got here yesterday.

646
00:48:43,530 --> 00:48:45,940
Aren't you going
to help your mom at work?

647
00:48:47,096 --> 00:48:49,041
- Never mind.
- I can help. What can I do?

648
00:48:49,096 --> 00:48:51,904
No, keep on drawing,
keep on drawing, honey.

649
00:48:51,964 --> 00:48:53,464
Keep on drawing.

650
00:48:58,096 --> 00:49:01,563
- Hi, girls.
- Dr. Carlos!

651
00:49:01,897 --> 00:49:03,772
What do you want in my fridge?

652
00:49:04,230 --> 00:49:07,038
- I want some guarana.
- Guarana.

653
00:49:13,396 --> 00:49:16,636
- How was it at the club?
- It was hot, very hot.

654
00:49:16,697 --> 00:49:18,902
It's going to pour down.

655
00:49:18,964 --> 00:49:21,202
- Thank you.
- It's so hot.

656
00:49:22,697 --> 00:49:25,038
Dr. Carlos,
look how well she can draw.

657
00:49:25,096 --> 00:49:27,233
It isn't finished yet, Edna,
didn't I tell you?

658
00:49:27,296 --> 00:49:30,570
Let me see, let me see.

659
00:49:30,630 --> 00:49:33,073
- But it isn't finished.
- It's OK.

660
00:49:34,597 --> 00:49:37,074
Very good.
Did you take a course?

661
00:49:37,129 --> 00:49:40,006
- No.
- That's why you're good.

662
00:49:41,730 --> 00:49:43,605
Let's visit my atelier.

663
00:49:44,530 --> 00:49:46,474
- Can we, Val?
- Well, go.

664
00:49:46,530 --> 00:49:47,735
- Let's go.
- Can I?

665
00:49:47,797 --> 00:49:48,968
Yes.

666
00:49:49,930 --> 00:49:51,271
Come.

667
00:49:51,897 --> 00:49:55,238
- Val, can you serve lunch?
- Yes, sir. I was about to do that.

668
00:49:59,996 --> 00:50:01,338
Now we're done for.

669
00:50:02,096 --> 00:50:05,267
Once I spent six months
on a palette.

670
00:50:05,330 --> 00:50:06,774
Creating different colors?

671
00:50:06,830 --> 00:50:09,330
To get to the right colors.

672
00:50:09,396 --> 00:50:11,840
- This one is really beautiful.
- You think?

673
00:50:11,897 --> 00:50:13,374
I do.

674
00:50:14,597 --> 00:50:18,097
It's a pity it's kept in here.
It should be on a wall.

675
00:50:18,163 --> 00:50:20,607
- Put it up on yours.
- Oh, no.

676
00:50:20,663 --> 00:50:22,937
Seriously. Do you like it?

677
00:50:22,996 --> 00:50:24,996
- This one?
- Yeah.

678
00:50:25,797 --> 00:50:27,638
- It's really beautiful.
- So, it's a present.

679
00:50:29,230 --> 00:50:30,799
- For me?
- Yes.

680
00:50:30,864 --> 00:50:32,364
How am I going to carry it?

681
00:50:32,430 --> 00:50:34,738
You have to find a big car.

682
00:50:34,797 --> 00:50:36,138
Thanks.

683
00:50:37,430 --> 00:50:40,340
I don't even know how to wrap it
so it won't get damaged.

684
00:50:40,396 --> 00:50:41,669
I'll help you.

685
00:50:43,263 --> 00:50:45,002
I'm in love with it.

686
00:50:45,330 --> 00:50:47,865
Yeah? In love?

687
00:50:48,230 --> 00:50:50,003
Very beautiful.

688
00:50:51,730 --> 00:50:53,799
And why did you stop painting?

689
00:50:55,497 --> 00:50:58,498
I stopped painting
because I stopped smoking.

690
00:50:59,463 --> 00:51:01,065
I'm joking.

691
00:51:02,996 --> 00:51:06,133
There are more pictures here.
I think there's a picture of Val.

692
00:51:11,296 --> 00:51:12,865
Look.

693
00:51:16,697 --> 00:51:18,140
Cool.

694
00:51:19,497 --> 00:51:22,668
She looks like those
advertisement maids. All in white.

695
00:51:24,230 --> 00:51:28,265
I stopped painting because everyone
told me I was the one, you know?

696
00:51:28,330 --> 00:51:29,831
And I believed in it,
but I wasn't.

697
00:51:33,830 --> 00:51:36,637
I don't know.
A lot happened and I stopped.

698
00:51:36,697 --> 00:51:38,436
- Stopped working?
- Yeah.

699
00:51:38,497 --> 00:51:40,270
How do you make money?
Bárbara supports you?

700
00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:42,137
If Bárbara supports me?

701
00:51:42,196 --> 00:51:44,105
- Doesn't she?
- No.

702
00:51:44,929 --> 00:51:47,305
It's not so obvious,
but the money is mine.

703
00:51:47,630 --> 00:51:50,198
My father worked a lot,
made a lot of money...

704
00:51:50,263 --> 00:51:52,002
and I inherited it.

705
00:51:53,096 --> 00:51:55,836
Everybody dances, but I'm the DJ.

706
00:51:59,129 --> 00:52:00,436
Excuse me.

707
00:52:00,864 --> 00:52:02,239
Hi, Val.

708
00:52:02,630 --> 00:52:04,073
Lunch is served.

709
00:52:04,129 --> 00:52:06,038
- Already?
- Yes.

710
00:52:06,096 --> 00:52:08,005
Can Jéssica have lunch with me?

711
00:52:08,863 --> 00:52:10,535
- Jéssica?
- Yeah.

712
00:52:11,530 --> 00:52:14,973
- Are you inviting her?
- Of course I am. Come on, Val!

713
00:52:16,330 --> 00:52:18,103
Add another plate to the table.

714
00:52:18,396 --> 00:52:20,067
- Of course.
- What?

715
00:52:20,129 --> 00:52:22,164
- Of course.
- Oh, OK.

716
00:52:22,230 --> 00:52:26,003
And don't tell Bárbara I was smoking.
You know I hide in here to smoke.

717
00:52:26,063 --> 00:52:28,007
Don't worry.
Let's go. The food will get cold.

718
00:52:28,063 --> 00:52:31,064
- She beats me up!
- I want to come back to see the rest.

719
00:52:31,129 --> 00:52:32,198
We will.

720
00:52:47,263 --> 00:52:51,230
It has 11, 12, 13 floors.

721
00:52:51,763 --> 00:52:55,206
It's the Northeast Development Authority.

722
00:52:55,263 --> 00:52:59,173
It's a building that looks
like Copan I think.

723
00:53:00,630 --> 00:53:03,437
It's somewhat modernist.

724
00:53:03,497 --> 00:53:07,066
- I'd like to visit Copan.
- We have to go there.

725
00:53:07,129 --> 00:53:09,733
- Can we go there?
- Sure, we can arrange it.

726
00:53:17,796 --> 00:53:20,468
- Val.
- Yes?

727
00:53:21,029 --> 00:53:22,973
- Val?
- I'm coming.

728
00:53:28,630 --> 00:53:31,767
- Can you clear the table?
- The omelet was very good.

729
00:53:31,829 --> 00:53:33,171
Very good.

730
00:53:36,230 --> 00:53:38,071
- Let me help you.
- No, let Val do it.

731
00:53:38,129 --> 00:53:40,630
- I can take it.
- No, let Val do it. Val does it.

732
00:53:55,396 --> 00:53:57,805
Can you bring us
some coffee, Val?

733
00:53:57,863 --> 00:53:59,807
Is there anything sweet, Val?

734
00:53:59,863 --> 00:54:01,932
Bring us some ice cream.

735
00:54:05,896 --> 00:54:07,169
What?

736
00:54:13,896 --> 00:54:15,965
"Is there anything sweet?"

737
00:54:28,263 --> 00:54:31,002
- Really? Did you like it?
- Yes. It was very good.

738
00:54:34,563 --> 00:54:37,439
- Thanks, Val.
- No, Val, not this one.

739
00:54:37,497 --> 00:54:39,137
Bring the one with chocolate and almonds.

740
00:54:40,096 --> 00:54:41,631
Fabinho's?

741
00:54:41,697 --> 00:54:43,265
Fabinho's?

742
00:54:43,330 --> 00:54:45,467
Everything in this house
is ours, and Jéssica's.

743
00:54:45,530 --> 00:54:47,166
The other one,
chocolate with almonds.

744
00:54:47,230 --> 00:54:50,969
- Fabinho's ice cream?
- Chocolate with almonds.

745
00:55:02,263 --> 00:55:04,831
When Fabinho asks
for his ice cream-

746
00:55:07,996 --> 00:55:11,031
- Do you like beans?
- I love them.

747
00:55:11,096 --> 00:55:14,131
- One can't live without beans.
- I love it too.

748
00:55:14,196 --> 00:55:15,867
I'll serve it, Val.

749
00:55:17,563 --> 00:55:20,632
Looks good. Must be tasty.

750
00:55:20,696 --> 00:55:22,231
This one is good.

751
00:55:22,729 --> 00:55:24,173
Thank you.

752
00:55:25,063 --> 00:55:27,268
- I can do it.
- Leave it to me.

753
00:55:43,463 --> 00:55:46,134
- You never had this one?
- Never.

754
00:55:46,196 --> 00:55:47,935
These small bowls.

755
00:56:06,330 --> 00:56:08,807
"Is there anything sweet?", she asked.

756
00:56:08,863 --> 00:56:10,569
"Isn't there anything sweet?"

757
00:56:10,629 --> 00:56:12,198
Something sweet.

758
00:56:12,263 --> 00:56:15,332
She doesn't stand up
when you walk into the kitchen.

759
00:56:15,396 --> 00:56:17,305
Edna, please.

760
00:56:17,363 --> 00:56:19,534
I'm the one talking about Jéssica.

761
00:56:19,929 --> 00:56:23,237
You're not supposed to talk about Jéssica.
I'm talking about Jéssica.

762
00:56:24,597 --> 00:56:26,404
"Isn't there anything sweet?"

763
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:35,203
Visiting here and there with Dr. Carlos.

764
00:56:35,996 --> 00:56:37,667
It seems like-

765
00:56:38,662 --> 00:56:41,266
She doesn't have a clue, you know.

766
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:45,070
Damn it.

767
00:56:45,363 --> 00:56:46,704
Damn it.

768
00:56:47,796 --> 00:56:50,967
Edna, look at this.

769
00:56:51,497 --> 00:56:53,372
I scrubbed it so hard that-

770
00:56:53,430 --> 00:56:55,465
You're too nervous.
Let me fix this.

771
00:56:55,530 --> 00:56:57,837
We can use some superglue.

772
00:56:58,563 --> 00:57:00,541
Old stuff.

773
00:57:01,296 --> 00:57:05,831
The hallway, the dining room,
the living room, see?

774
00:57:06,896 --> 00:57:09,874
This belongs to this floor.

775
00:57:09,929 --> 00:57:12,533
To this side, on the lower floor...

776
00:57:13,129 --> 00:57:15,766
there's your bedroom.

777
00:57:16,263 --> 00:57:19,070
And why is it called a "plan"?

778
00:57:21,096 --> 00:57:22,937
Good question.

779
00:57:23,796 --> 00:57:25,740
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

780
00:57:25,796 --> 00:57:28,569
- I don't.
- Is that what you want to do?

781
00:57:29,562 --> 00:57:32,302
- Yeah, sort of.
- Val.

782
00:57:32,729 --> 00:57:34,401
- Not only that.
- Val?

783
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:35,963
Coming!

784
00:57:39,129 --> 00:57:40,936
Can you clear the table, please?

785
00:57:41,896 --> 00:57:44,204
Val, can you bring
my ice cream, please?

786
00:58:08,230 --> 00:58:10,105
Give me some, Val.

787
00:58:10,463 --> 00:58:12,701
This is Fabinho's!

788
00:58:12,762 --> 00:58:15,104
But he said I could have it.

789
00:58:15,163 --> 00:58:19,107
When they offer you
something that is theirs...

790
00:58:19,163 --> 00:58:21,107
they're being polite.

791
00:58:21,163 --> 00:58:24,266
They are sure we're going to say no.

792
00:58:30,129 --> 00:58:31,504
Thank you.

793
00:58:42,796 --> 00:58:46,263
If you are to have ice cream,
this is the one. This is ours.

794
00:59:23,863 --> 00:59:26,205
It's impressive, isn't it?

795
00:59:27,963 --> 00:59:31,805
There are endless buildings.
You never see the end of it.

796
00:59:35,363 --> 00:59:39,898
Sometimes I think
about something cool I saw on TV...

797
00:59:40,596 --> 00:59:47,200
a show about what would happen
if we ceased to exist.

798
00:59:47,662 --> 00:59:52,368
And, it said in 100 years
it would all be jungle again.

799
00:59:52,996 --> 00:59:55,338
Back to the way it was.

800
00:59:55,729 --> 00:59:59,673
I think it would be interesting.

801
01:00:02,496 --> 01:00:05,474
- 100 years?
- Not enough time, isn't it?

802
01:00:06,029 --> 01:00:08,506
Don't know if it was 100.
I can't remember.

803
01:00:13,363 --> 01:00:16,602
- Thank you for the tour. I really liked it.
- Don't mention it.

804
01:00:26,330 --> 01:00:28,364
I'm sorry, José Carlos.

805
01:00:29,796 --> 01:00:31,671
No, I am sorry.

806
01:00:36,562 --> 01:00:38,063
Hello?

807
01:00:38,629 --> 01:00:39,971
Yes?

808
01:00:40,263 --> 01:00:41,763
Hi, Janaína.

809
01:00:42,762 --> 01:00:44,263
What?

810
01:00:45,029 --> 01:00:46,734
Was it serious?

811
01:00:47,662 --> 01:00:49,435
But what happened?

812
01:00:51,029 --> 01:00:52,529
Is she OK?

813
01:00:53,462 --> 01:00:55,440
OK. I'm coming.

814
01:00:57,296 --> 01:01:00,535
- Bárbara's had an accident.
- Is it serious?

815
01:01:00,596 --> 01:01:03,631
- Apparently she's OK.
- So we'd better go.

816
01:01:04,496 --> 01:01:06,168
Yes, I have to go.

817
01:01:13,362 --> 01:01:15,431
She hit her head?

818
01:01:15,496 --> 01:01:17,270
She hurt her forehead.

819
01:01:17,329 --> 01:01:19,137
- Oh, God!
- And the shoulder.

820
01:01:19,196 --> 01:01:21,366
- She hurt her forehead?
- Forehead and shoulder.

821
01:01:21,429 --> 01:01:23,634
He said she was nervous.

822
01:01:23,996 --> 01:01:25,996
Dona Bárbara was nervous?

823
01:01:26,063 --> 01:01:29,529
Yeah, she crashed the car,
got scared.

824
01:01:29,596 --> 01:01:31,767
Really scary. God forbid!

825
01:01:36,762 --> 01:01:39,433
How do they manage
to have such clear water, Val?

826
01:01:39,496 --> 01:01:42,065
Don't even look
at this pool, Jéssica!

827
01:01:42,129 --> 01:01:44,572
- This is not for you.
- I didn't say anything.

828
01:01:44,629 --> 01:01:47,039
You didn't say it,
but you thought it. I know.

829
01:01:47,096 --> 01:01:48,698
Do you hear me?

830
01:01:49,796 --> 01:01:51,637
You never swam here?

831
01:01:51,696 --> 01:01:54,469
Why would I swim
in someone else's pool?

832
01:01:56,029 --> 01:01:58,302
- Never?
- Never.

833
01:01:58,362 --> 01:02:01,704
And if one day they invite you
to get into the pool...

834
01:02:01,762 --> 01:02:04,036
you'll say you don't have
a swimsuit, that you can't.

835
01:02:04,096 --> 01:02:06,630
- Got it?
- Got it.

836
01:02:06,696 --> 01:02:08,197
What's up, Val?

837
01:02:08,929 --> 01:02:11,805
- Valzinha!
- Get off me, Skull.

838
01:02:11,863 --> 01:02:15,239
- Oh, Skull, get out of here with this hair.
- My sweetheart.

839
01:02:15,629 --> 01:02:17,039
This hairy guy is Skull.

840
01:02:17,096 --> 01:02:19,664
Comb your hair
before you talk to my daughter.

841
01:02:20,362 --> 01:02:21,642
- How are you?
- This is Jéssica.

842
01:02:21,696 --> 01:02:23,503
- What's up?
- Charmed.

843
01:02:23,562 --> 01:02:24,972
- So, let's swim?
- Sure.

844
01:02:25,029 --> 01:02:27,302
These boys are hollow-heads.

845
01:02:28,896 --> 01:02:31,067
Won't you get in, Jéssica?

846
01:02:31,129 --> 01:02:32,731
The water is nice.

847
01:02:33,462 --> 01:02:35,269
I don't have a swimsuit.

848
01:02:40,063 --> 01:02:42,336
- Jump with your clothes on.
- But I'm dressed.

849
01:02:44,395 --> 01:02:48,135
I think it's your mom arriving.
It's Dona Bárbara.

850
01:02:48,529 --> 01:02:49,632
Stop!

851
01:02:52,329 --> 01:02:54,603
Stop it, stop it. No, no, no.

852
01:02:55,529 --> 01:02:57,007
Stop it, Fab!

853
01:03:16,462 --> 01:03:18,770
- Pull it up a bit?
- Yeah.

854
01:03:20,629 --> 01:03:22,402
Who's in the pool? Fabinho?

855
01:03:22,462 --> 01:03:25,235
- Fabinho and Skull.
- Oh, OK.

856
01:03:25,295 --> 01:03:27,171
They're both there.

857
01:03:28,529 --> 01:03:31,030
There's someone else there.
Who is it? Jéssica?

858
01:03:32,029 --> 01:03:35,234
No, Jéssica is waiting for me,
just looking.

859
01:03:35,295 --> 01:03:38,035
But, I'm going to check
what this noise is all about.

860
01:03:38,096 --> 01:03:39,596
Excuse me.

861
01:03:40,796 --> 01:03:42,467
No, stop it.

862
01:03:42,796 --> 01:03:45,797
Jéssica!
Get out of there, Jéssica!

863
01:03:47,262 --> 01:03:49,797
Jéssica, get out of there now!

864
01:03:50,729 --> 01:03:53,832
- Look, Dr. Carlos is right here!
- Fabinho!

865
01:03:53,896 --> 01:03:56,499
I don't know what's gotten into her
to plunge into the-

866
01:03:56,562 --> 01:03:57,938
I'm going there, Dr. Carlos.

867
01:03:57,996 --> 01:04:01,235
- Val, is she in the water?
- The workers are all looking. Fabinho!

868
01:04:02,662 --> 01:04:04,004
Carlos!

869
01:04:04,863 --> 01:04:06,670
Carlos, help me out here!

870
01:04:06,729 --> 01:04:09,297
José Carlos, help me out here!

871
01:04:10,096 --> 01:04:12,198
Oh, Fabinho!

872
01:04:12,996 --> 01:04:16,565
What a stupid prank!
Get her out of there.

873
01:04:16,629 --> 01:04:19,232
Jéssica! Jéssica!
Get out of there quickly.

874
01:04:19,295 --> 01:04:20,739
Get out, get out, Jéssica!

875
01:04:20,796 --> 01:04:23,501
Obey your mother!
She's talking to you!

876
01:04:23,562 --> 01:04:25,733
- Get out of the water.
- Obey your mother.

877
01:04:25,796 --> 01:04:27,330
You're gonna catch a cold.

878
01:04:27,395 --> 01:04:30,067
- Listen to Dr. Carlos and Dona Bárbara.
- I'm coming.

879
01:04:30,128 --> 01:04:33,334
Have you lost your mind? Get out.

880
01:04:35,929 --> 01:04:37,702
Jéssica...

881
01:04:38,496 --> 01:04:39,997
come on.

882
01:04:40,429 --> 01:04:42,873
- I'm coming.
- You're dragging your feet.

883
01:04:43,829 --> 01:04:45,102
Come, come.

884
01:04:45,162 --> 01:04:47,572
- No need to hold me like that.
- Come, Jéssica!

885
01:04:47,629 --> 01:04:50,573
I'm going to get a towel.

886
01:04:50,629 --> 01:04:52,732
Look at that, you're naked.
Are you crazy?

887
01:04:52,796 --> 01:04:55,535
- Fabinho, Fabinho.
- Yes?

888
01:04:55,596 --> 01:04:57,972
- Get up here, I want to talk to you.
- Mom, how embarrassing.

889
01:04:58,029 --> 01:05:00,666
Now, Fabinho. Now!

890
01:05:00,729 --> 01:05:02,673
- I'm coming.
- Listen to your mom, Fabinho.

891
01:05:02,729 --> 01:05:05,400
- Are you already high?
- High? What are you talking about?

892
01:05:05,462 --> 01:05:09,201
What am I talking about?
I was in an accident, did you know?

893
01:05:09,262 --> 01:05:11,900
I was unconscious,
taken to the hospital by ambulance.

894
01:05:11,963 --> 01:05:14,873
- I got seriously hurt!
- The doctor said you were fine!

895
01:05:14,929 --> 01:05:17,566
Is that why
you didn't even come see me?

896
01:05:17,629 --> 01:05:19,538
You didn't even come see me, dude.

897
01:05:19,596 --> 01:05:21,369
You don't give a damn about me.

898
01:05:21,429 --> 01:05:23,338
You didn't even come see me!

899
01:05:23,762 --> 01:05:25,205
Calm down, Mom.

900
01:05:25,262 --> 01:05:27,137
"Calm down." That's great.

901
01:05:27,195 --> 01:05:28,696
It hurts.

902
01:05:29,029 --> 01:05:30,506
OK?

903
01:05:33,229 --> 01:05:35,400
- Can I go?
- Yes.

904
01:05:36,362 --> 01:05:37,965
Well, bye.

905
01:05:41,395 --> 01:05:45,033
Do you have the pool guy's number?
Cláudio?

906
01:05:45,095 --> 01:05:46,903
Call him, please.

907
01:05:50,395 --> 01:05:52,373
- Do you have it?
- Yes.

908
01:05:53,762 --> 01:05:55,967
- Give it to me.
- It's ringing.

909
01:06:03,062 --> 01:06:04,369
Cláudio?

910
01:06:04,963 --> 01:06:07,099
Hi, it's Bárbara from Morumbi.

911
01:06:09,095 --> 01:06:11,903
I know, but I need you
to come tomorrow. Can you?

912
01:06:13,062 --> 01:06:14,699
We had a problem here.

913
01:06:16,429 --> 01:06:19,168
Come on, Meg, stop sniffing.

914
01:06:25,295 --> 01:06:29,171
Take a crap already!
Today I'm out of patience, even for you.

915
01:06:36,329 --> 01:06:39,239
But you did all you could
to be thrown in the pool.

916
01:06:39,295 --> 01:06:41,855
You weren't even there.
You don't know what you're talking about.

917
01:06:43,028 --> 01:06:45,632
- I want to leave this place.
- It'll be better.

918
01:06:45,696 --> 01:06:47,674
Didn't I tell you from the start?

919
01:06:47,729 --> 01:06:51,172
- It's not working.
- It really isn't. I warned you.

920
01:06:52,195 --> 01:06:54,173
I don't know where
you learned these things.

921
01:06:54,229 --> 01:06:57,173
What you can and cannot do.
Is there a handbook?

922
01:06:57,229 --> 01:06:59,138
How come? Who taught you that?

923
01:06:59,195 --> 01:07:02,105
They explained it to you
when you got here?

924
01:07:08,195 --> 01:07:09,696
Nobody has to explain that.

925
01:07:09,762 --> 01:07:12,535
You're born knowing it,
what you can and cannot do.

926
01:07:12,596 --> 01:07:16,699
- It's like you're from another planet.
- Who's born knowing it?

927
01:07:17,863 --> 01:07:21,238
- How are you?
- I'm fine, honey. So?

928
01:07:21,295 --> 01:07:24,000
So, did you check that room
in Campo Limpo?

929
01:07:24,062 --> 01:07:26,199
Yes, I talked to Diléia.

930
01:07:26,262 --> 01:07:28,797
It's R$ 400. Good price, huh?

931
01:07:28,863 --> 01:07:30,135
- Great!
- 400?

932
01:07:30,195 --> 01:07:32,639
- We're taking it, right?
- OK.

933
01:07:32,696 --> 01:07:35,105
- Yes, it's good.
- It's better this way. See you tomorrow.

934
01:07:35,162 --> 01:07:37,231
- Oh, yeah?
- Things aren't working out there.

935
01:07:37,295 --> 01:07:40,466
- What happened?
- I'll tell you some other time.

936
01:07:40,529 --> 01:07:42,063
Can you believe she got into the pool?

937
01:07:42,128 --> 01:07:43,765
- Let's go, Val.
- My goodness.

938
01:07:43,829 --> 01:07:45,465
- Dona Bárbara's pool.
- Come on.

939
01:07:45,529 --> 01:07:48,598
- Come back later so we can talk, Val.
- Raimunda, I'm about to go crazy.

940
01:07:48,662 --> 01:07:50,230
OK, bye.

941
01:08:31,962 --> 01:08:33,736
Let's do the following.
I'll take the photos...

942
01:08:33,796 --> 01:08:35,705
make a selection
and send them to you.

943
01:08:35,762 --> 01:08:37,262
I don't want you to get tired.

944
01:08:37,329 --> 01:08:39,329
- You have to look gorgeous.
- OK.

945
01:08:40,529 --> 01:08:42,632
Dona Bárbara, we're leaving.

946
01:08:42,696 --> 01:08:46,935
- OK. So you found a place?
- Sort of.

947
01:08:46,995 --> 01:08:50,769
- OK. Did you make the pie?
- Yes, ma'am.

948
01:08:51,662 --> 01:08:54,299
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

949
01:08:54,662 --> 01:08:57,162
Here we go. Excuse us.

950
01:08:58,062 --> 01:09:00,336
Good luck on the university's
entrance exam.

951
01:09:06,128 --> 01:09:07,867
Let's carry on.

952
01:09:07,928 --> 01:09:11,236
- Dr. Carlos, we're leaving.
- OK.

953
01:09:12,128 --> 01:09:14,834
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

954
01:09:15,596 --> 01:09:18,096
- It's been a pleasure.
- My pleasure.

955
01:09:18,162 --> 01:09:19,867
Well, let me-

956
01:09:22,195 --> 01:09:24,503
- No, Dr. Carlos. For God's sake!
- Val, buy her a little something.

957
01:09:24,562 --> 01:09:26,540
- Take it, buy her a little something.
- God! No!

958
01:09:26,596 --> 01:09:28,834
- You're making me uncomfortable.
- Not at all.

959
01:09:28,895 --> 01:09:30,532
I appreciate it.

960
01:09:31,995 --> 01:09:33,701
- See you.
- Bye.

961
01:09:44,962 --> 01:09:46,599
Everything OK there?

962
01:09:48,729 --> 01:09:51,707
- Here guys, let's get in.
- Come, Raimunda.

963
01:09:51,762 --> 01:09:53,569
You can take a look around.

964
01:09:53,629 --> 01:09:55,538
- Gee, is it here?
- Yeah.

965
01:09:55,596 --> 01:09:58,073
Funny, it doesn't look like home.

966
01:09:58,128 --> 01:10:00,504
Do people live here?
It looks like a hair salon.

967
01:10:00,562 --> 01:10:02,062
It used to be one.

968
01:10:02,128 --> 01:10:05,129
The person who used to live here made one.
That's why the big mirror.

969
01:10:05,195 --> 01:10:07,730
Raimunda,
these walls are in poor condition.

970
01:10:07,795 --> 01:10:09,467
Don't you think
the color looks tacky?

971
01:10:09,529 --> 01:10:11,302
Come on, woman, it looks beautiful.

972
01:10:11,362 --> 01:10:14,431
- We can paint it, Val.
- You think?

973
01:10:14,496 --> 01:10:16,201
- You can paint it.
- Yeah.

974
01:10:16,262 --> 01:10:20,434
This window airs the place
in the afternoon.

975
01:10:20,496 --> 01:10:23,337
There are grids everywhere, very safe.

976
01:10:23,395 --> 01:10:27,203
The shower is brand new
and very good.

977
01:10:27,762 --> 01:10:29,966
- We'll take it.
- OK.

978
01:10:30,028 --> 01:10:32,563
- Did you like it?
- It's OK, Val.

979
01:10:32,629 --> 01:10:35,368
- I have to talk to the Peruvian guy.
- We'll make it work.

980
01:10:35,429 --> 01:10:37,566
- 400 bucks?
- Be nice to him and it'll work.

981
01:10:37,629 --> 01:10:39,538
Let's go there and talk to him.

982
01:10:39,596 --> 01:10:41,096
I said I wanted it. Just a second.

983
01:10:41,162 --> 01:10:43,436
Raimunda,
didn't you tell him I wanted it?

984
01:10:43,496 --> 01:10:44,996
I did.

985
01:10:45,062 --> 01:10:46,937
- Raimunda told him.
- He even said the price.

986
01:10:46,995 --> 01:10:49,905
The problem is that
there was no deposit.

987
01:10:49,962 --> 01:10:51,803
What deposit?
I hadn't even seen the place!

988
01:10:51,862 --> 01:10:55,068
How can someone make a deposit
without seeing the place?

989
01:10:55,128 --> 01:10:58,299
Listen, I'm going to make
a real effort here.

990
01:10:58,362 --> 01:11:01,033
- I'm going to find you a place.
- Can we see something today?

991
01:11:01,095 --> 01:11:03,664
- Not today, but-
- I came to stay.

992
01:11:03,728 --> 01:11:05,400
Let me stay with you today, Pamela.

993
01:11:05,462 --> 01:11:08,803
Edmilson is coming this week.

994
01:11:08,862 --> 01:11:10,602
- Only for tonight.
- I can't.

995
01:11:10,662 --> 01:11:12,606
- Don't be like that.
- Edmilson has only one day off.

996
01:11:12,662 --> 01:11:15,572
- Just so I have a place to sleep tonight.
- Only one day off.

997
01:11:15,629 --> 01:11:17,106
He's coming. It won't work.

998
01:11:17,162 --> 01:11:19,640
- Calm down, Jéssica.
- I don't want to go back.

999
01:11:19,696 --> 01:11:22,264
- Jéssica, please, just a week.
- We had agreed to stay here today.

1000
01:11:22,329 --> 01:11:24,806
It'll be quick.
Are they treating you badly?

1001
01:11:24,862 --> 01:11:27,500
- It's not like that!
- Is it Dr. Carlos?

1002
01:11:27,562 --> 01:11:30,335
- Fabinho? Didn't you like him?
- That's not what I'm saying.

1003
01:11:30,395 --> 01:11:32,168
Dr. Carlos is even pampering her.

1004
01:11:32,229 --> 01:11:33,729
Carlos.

1005
01:11:35,596 --> 01:11:38,335
- José Carlos!
- Hi.

1006
01:11:48,562 --> 01:11:54,006
- Right, Val?
- Dr. Carlos, it's just for a week.

1007
01:11:54,062 --> 01:11:55,506
It's no problem at all, Val.

1008
01:11:55,562 --> 01:11:57,800
Thank you so much.

1009
01:11:57,862 --> 01:11:59,465
The owner didn't keep his word.

1010
01:11:59,529 --> 01:12:02,370
Stay for as long as you need.
No problem.

1011
01:12:02,795 --> 01:12:06,069
Thank you.
It won't be long, Dona Bárbara.

1012
01:12:06,128 --> 01:12:07,470
Yeah, OK.

1013
01:12:07,529 --> 01:12:10,132
Listen, you won't believe
what I saw in the pool.

1014
01:12:10,195 --> 01:12:12,230
A rat, Val. Can you believe it?

1015
01:12:12,295 --> 01:12:14,603
- Oh, no, Dona Bárbara.
- A rat. I screamed from up here.

1016
01:12:21,761 --> 01:12:23,262
You're back.

1017
01:12:25,395 --> 01:12:28,430
- Didn't work out with the room?
- It didn't.

1018
01:12:32,895 --> 01:12:34,532
Want some water?

1019
01:12:34,596 --> 01:12:36,301
I've got some here.

1020
01:12:45,695 --> 01:12:47,866
You know, this house here is-

1021
01:12:49,529 --> 01:12:51,404
It's like it was yours.

1022
01:12:53,229 --> 01:12:55,366
Anything you need.

1023
01:12:56,496 --> 01:13:01,099
The house felt empty
without you, you know?

1024
01:13:05,529 --> 01:13:06,972
Thank you.

1025
01:13:08,529 --> 01:13:11,405
Do you believe in reincarnation?

1026
01:13:16,162 --> 01:13:19,299
I don't know.
I've never thought much about it.

1027
01:13:19,362 --> 01:13:23,772
I don't. I think this
is our only time here.

1028
01:13:25,995 --> 01:13:31,962
So sometimes we say things
that might sound crazy.

1029
01:13:32,028 --> 01:13:34,267
But maybe not saying it...

1030
01:13:35,728 --> 01:13:40,672
would be crazy too,
if this is my only chance.

1031
01:13:45,862 --> 01:13:47,897
Would you marry me?

1032
01:13:55,496 --> 01:13:57,371
Marry me.

1033
01:13:58,229 --> 01:14:00,672
I'll take you anywhere you want.

1034
01:14:15,462 --> 01:14:17,167
It's a little hot in here, right?

1035
01:14:21,362 --> 01:14:23,600
I'm sorry, José Carlos.

1036
01:14:23,661 --> 01:14:25,969
- I don't know what to say.
- No, no. Please, forgive me.

1037
01:14:26,028 --> 01:14:28,938
Yes. Say yes.

1038
01:14:29,995 --> 01:14:31,529
Say yes.

1039
01:14:33,062 --> 01:14:35,131
- Marry me.
- No.

1040
01:14:35,195 --> 01:14:39,264
- Sorry. I'm just-
- I... don't understand.

1041
01:14:39,329 --> 01:14:41,102
Sorry.

1042
01:14:41,429 --> 01:14:44,270
It was a joke.

1043
01:14:44,795 --> 01:14:46,864
- Only a joke?
- Yeah, yeah.

1044
01:14:46,928 --> 01:14:48,701
Holy shit!

1045
01:14:48,761 --> 01:14:51,568
Sorry. It was a joke.

1046
01:15:03,995 --> 01:15:07,700
My cousin never comes to São Paulo,
but she's coming now.

1047
01:15:07,761 --> 01:15:10,898
And since Jéssica had
already left the guest room...

1048
01:15:10,962 --> 01:15:13,031
I told her she could stay here.

1049
01:15:13,095 --> 01:15:17,335
So I'm gonna need you
to get Jéssica out of there.

1050
01:15:17,395 --> 01:15:19,100
- That's fine.
- OK?

1051
01:15:19,162 --> 01:15:22,662
- She's going to my room.
- OK, ask her to leave the room today.

1052
01:15:22,728 --> 01:15:25,968
- Yes, ma'am.
- So we have time to organize everything.

1053
01:15:26,028 --> 01:15:27,630
- It's settled then.
- OK?

1054
01:15:27,695 --> 01:15:30,468
- Don't worry about it.
- Thank you, Val.

1055
01:15:30,962 --> 01:15:33,667
- But ask her to leave today, OK?
- Yes, ma'am.

1056
01:15:33,728 --> 01:15:36,332
- OK, thanks.
- I have to check on the food.

1057
01:16:04,728 --> 01:16:08,104
Can't we open this window, Val?
It's hot as hell!

1058
01:16:08,395 --> 01:16:11,998
If you do it, it'll be just as hot
and the mosquitoes will get in.

1059
01:16:12,062 --> 01:16:15,437
Honestly, Val,
I don't know how you can take it.

1060
01:16:17,661 --> 01:16:19,730
How I can take what?

1061
01:16:20,062 --> 01:16:23,199
Being treated
like a second-class citizen.

1062
01:16:23,495 --> 01:16:25,201
This is worse than India.

1063
01:16:25,262 --> 01:16:27,637
Don't give me this
complicated India talk.

1064
01:16:27,695 --> 01:16:29,536
You're a stuck-up person.
That's what you are!

1065
01:16:29,595 --> 01:16:31,198
This is really fucked up.

1066
01:16:31,262 --> 01:16:33,171
Watch your mouth!

1067
01:16:33,229 --> 01:16:35,298
I don't like bad words!

1068
01:16:37,928 --> 01:16:40,667
You think you're special.
You think you're better than everyone else.

1069
01:16:40,728 --> 01:16:42,501
You think you're superior.

1070
01:16:42,561 --> 01:16:46,505
I don't think I'm better, Val.
I just don't think I'm worse. Got it?

1071
01:16:46,561 --> 01:16:49,596
- You'll make me lose my job.
- Fuck it!

1072
01:16:49,661 --> 01:16:52,935
Watch your mouth.
Wash your mouth out with soap!

1073
01:16:52,995 --> 01:16:54,495
Show some respect.
I'm your mother.

1074
01:16:54,561 --> 01:16:58,233
You're not my mother. Sandra raised me.
You had nothing to do with it.

1075
01:16:58,295 --> 01:17:02,330
Look here! Sandra raised you
with the money I sent every month...

1076
01:17:02,394 --> 01:17:04,838
to pay for your school, your dentist.

1077
01:17:04,895 --> 01:17:06,497
Sandra got the good part.

1078
01:17:06,561 --> 01:17:08,664
Sandra got to be with you...

1079
01:17:08,728 --> 01:17:11,797
while I was here working,
sweating, do you hear me?

1080
01:17:12,329 --> 01:17:14,397
Now, Sandra is your mother.

1081
01:17:14,461 --> 01:17:18,633
- Who paid Sandra's bills every month?
- Enough, Val! Fuck!

1082
01:17:20,295 --> 01:17:22,102
I'm tired, you know.

1083
01:17:22,162 --> 01:17:26,731
Tired of listening to this kind of talk.
Really tired.

1084
01:17:30,394 --> 01:17:32,998
Things are fine. I'm studying.

1085
01:17:36,162 --> 01:17:38,162
But let me ask you...

1086
01:17:39,128 --> 01:17:40,901
how's he doing?

1087
01:17:43,195 --> 01:17:45,036
Does he ask about me?

1088
01:17:48,361 --> 01:17:49,771
Really?

1089
01:17:52,528 --> 01:17:54,131
I wanted to see that.

1090
01:17:55,728 --> 01:17:57,865
I'm gonna let you sleep.

1091
01:17:58,328 --> 01:18:00,328
Talk to you later.

1092
01:18:02,528 --> 01:18:04,437
OK, see you.

1093
01:18:12,162 --> 01:18:13,798
Do you wanna smoke?

1094
01:18:15,028 --> 01:18:16,528
I do.

1095
01:18:26,294 --> 01:18:27,863
This is a good one.

1096
01:18:36,328 --> 01:18:38,328
So they drained the pool, huh?

1097
01:18:39,328 --> 01:18:41,567
My mom said she saw a rat in here.

1098
01:18:42,761 --> 01:18:45,329
I don't know. It's dangerous.
We could get sick.

1099
01:18:48,595 --> 01:18:50,096
Yeah, right.

1100
01:18:56,095 --> 01:18:57,766
Are you a virgin?

1101
01:19:01,661 --> 01:19:03,639
What kind of question is that?

1102
01:19:06,495 --> 01:19:08,268
Do I look like a virgin?

1103
01:19:09,461 --> 01:19:11,064
I don't know.

1104
01:19:11,761 --> 01:19:13,397
If you do-

1105
01:19:13,461 --> 01:19:15,496
- You look like a virgin!
- Me?

1106
01:19:15,561 --> 01:19:16,971
Yeah!

1107
01:19:17,328 --> 01:19:19,136
I don't only look like one.

1108
01:19:20,995 --> 01:19:23,871
- I'm not, OK?
- Of course not.

1109
01:19:29,261 --> 01:19:31,137
Do you think I'm a rat?

1110
01:19:31,528 --> 01:19:32,938
What?

1111
01:19:35,461 --> 01:19:37,133
Fuck.

1112
01:19:56,028 --> 01:19:57,835
I think I know already!

1113
01:19:58,595 --> 01:20:01,005
- You do?
- I think I do.

1114
01:20:01,062 --> 01:20:02,801
- But I don't.
- Could it be?

1115
01:20:03,962 --> 01:20:05,598
I'm totally lost.

1116
01:20:06,761 --> 01:20:08,363
You'll see.

1117
01:20:18,162 --> 01:20:19,833
There!

1118
01:20:22,062 --> 01:20:23,698
- It's FAU.
- Yes, it's FAU.

1119
01:20:25,294 --> 01:20:27,772
- It's where you're going to study, right?
- Yeah.

1120
01:20:28,595 --> 01:20:30,698
It's where I'd like to.

1121
01:20:30,761 --> 01:20:33,000
"Architecture and urbanism."

1122
01:21:03,528 --> 01:21:05,802
I'm going to take Maggie out. Come!

1123
01:21:05,862 --> 01:21:07,305
Come, Maggie!

1124
01:21:07,661 --> 01:21:09,138
Maggie.

1125
01:21:12,194 --> 01:21:13,604
Come.

1126
01:21:13,661 --> 01:21:17,434
Maggie stinks. She plunges into
the puddle and stays kind of wet.

1127
01:22:09,628 --> 01:22:12,105
That's why Fabinho's
ice cream doesn't last.

1128
01:22:17,127 --> 01:22:21,572
I've told you this is Fabinho's ice cream.
How stubborn of you.

1129
01:22:23,294 --> 01:22:25,294
My apologies, Dona Bárbara.

1130
01:22:27,328 --> 01:22:29,328
I've told her many times.

1131
01:22:36,728 --> 01:22:39,467
Since when has
my great-grandmother's tray been broken?

1132
01:22:43,094 --> 01:22:46,163
Val, it may not look like it,
but this is still my home.

1133
01:22:46,695 --> 01:22:49,468
Come here.
I want to talk to you.

1134
01:22:57,027 --> 01:23:01,335
Dona Bárbara,
just tell me where to fix it.

1135
01:23:01,394 --> 01:23:04,304
I'll take it there.
I'll do it. I'll pay for it.

1136
01:23:04,361 --> 01:23:05,896
- No, Val, that's not it.
- I'll pay for it.

1137
01:23:05,962 --> 01:23:08,200
Val, that's not the problem.

1138
01:23:10,394 --> 01:23:13,133
- The entrance exam is tomorrow, right?
- Yes, ma'am.

1139
01:23:13,194 --> 01:23:16,400
- And then she's leaving, right?
- Yes, she will, ma'am.

1140
01:23:16,761 --> 01:23:18,534
So while she's still here...

1141
01:23:18,595 --> 01:23:20,334
I want to ask you...

1142
01:23:21,294 --> 01:23:24,636
to make sure she's never
on this side of the kitchen door.

1143
01:23:24,695 --> 01:23:27,036
Yes ma'am. Not a step
on that side of the kitchen door.

1144
01:23:27,094 --> 01:23:28,868
Exactly, not a step
on this side of the kitchen door.

1145
01:23:28,928 --> 01:23:31,405
- Yes, ma'am.
- You can go. Thank you.

1146
01:23:41,094 --> 01:23:43,299
You don't know where Pamela lives!
It's far.

1147
01:23:43,361 --> 01:23:45,566
How are you going
to get there now?

1148
01:23:45,628 --> 01:23:48,333
- There's no way you can do that.
- I'll find a way.

1149
01:23:48,394 --> 01:23:50,463
Difficult girl.
Don't go, Jéssica, for God's sake.

1150
01:23:50,528 --> 01:23:53,267
I don't have the stomach
for this shit you take.

1151
01:23:53,328 --> 01:23:56,033
Leave this for now.
You've got your exam tomorrow.

1152
01:23:56,094 --> 01:23:59,903
I've got better things
to do than take this shit.

1153
01:23:59,961 --> 01:24:03,030
If you have the stomach
to stay here, do it! I'm out!

1154
01:24:03,094 --> 01:24:05,470
- Jéssica, you're not-
- You should've defended me!

1155
01:24:05,528 --> 01:24:08,994
Jéssica, you're not going
with such rain! Oh, God!

1156
01:24:09,061 --> 01:24:10,471
And how are you getting there?

1157
01:24:10,528 --> 01:24:12,937
I'll find a way!
I'm not afraid of water.

1158
01:24:12,994 --> 01:24:14,904
But where you're going-

1159
01:24:14,961 --> 01:24:18,064
Go back inside, Val! Go back.

1160
01:24:18,127 --> 01:24:21,662
- Have you lost your mind?
- Leave me alone!

1161
01:24:21,728 --> 01:24:26,297
- Go back inside!
- Tomorrow is your exam! You'll miss it!

1162
01:24:28,027 --> 01:24:30,027
Good luck!

1163
01:24:31,927 --> 01:24:34,269
May Jesus be with you.

1164
01:24:51,661 --> 01:24:53,332
Dear God.

1165
01:24:59,428 --> 01:25:02,235
- Let's go? I'm worried!
- OK, let's go.

1166
01:25:02,294 --> 01:25:05,329
- Maybe there'll be traffic.
- So let's get going. I'll call the driver.

1167
01:25:05,394 --> 01:25:07,702
You don't want any more coffee?
It's still early!

1168
01:25:07,761 --> 01:25:10,482
- I don't want to risk being late.
- What if we got stuck in traffic?

1169
01:25:10,495 --> 01:25:13,336
- An accident, traffic. Who knows?
- OK then.

1170
01:25:13,394 --> 01:25:15,736
- Right? So let's go.
- OK!

1171
01:25:16,328 --> 01:25:18,272
My bag is right in there.

1172
01:25:20,628 --> 01:25:24,629
- Did you get a cereal bar or something?
- Yes, I did.

1173
01:25:26,828 --> 01:25:28,362
Good luck.

1174
01:26:56,894 --> 01:26:59,395
- Very difficult.
- But do you think you did well?

1175
01:26:59,461 --> 01:27:01,336
- What's up, Son?
- I can't possibly know, Mom!

1176
01:27:01,394 --> 01:27:03,338
- The answer key just came out.
- Already?

1177
01:27:03,394 --> 01:27:05,338
- Yes. Let me open it here.
- Difficult?

1178
01:27:05,394 --> 01:27:07,463
Which was your exam?

1179
01:27:07,528 --> 01:27:10,267
- Letter Q.
- Q? Wait, let me find it here.

1180
01:27:10,328 --> 01:27:12,499
Did you see Jéssica, Fabinho?

1181
01:27:12,561 --> 01:27:14,436
Sorry, Val. I didn't.

1182
01:27:14,495 --> 01:27:16,995
Let's see here.
Val, will you excuse us?

1183
01:27:18,595 --> 01:27:20,163
- Can we start?
- Yes.

1184
01:27:20,228 --> 01:27:23,331
- 1C, did you get it right?
- Yeah.

1185
01:27:24,328 --> 01:27:26,397
- 2D.
- Got it.

1186
01:27:26,994 --> 01:27:28,336
3B.

1187
01:27:28,894 --> 01:27:31,395
It's OK. 4A.

1188
01:27:32,094 --> 01:27:33,163
No?

1189
01:27:33,228 --> 01:27:35,729
- Mom, keep talking and then-
- OK. 5E.

1190
01:27:35,794 --> 01:27:37,466
You got nervous.

1191
01:27:39,328 --> 01:27:41,272
You knew everything, didn't you?

1192
01:27:41,328 --> 01:27:43,033
You got nervous.

1193
01:27:46,394 --> 01:27:48,269
Shit, Val, by two points.

1194
01:27:48,328 --> 01:27:51,737
It's so unfair.
Chin up. Life goes on.

1195
01:27:51,794 --> 01:27:55,000
- Fabinho.
- You can try again next year.

1196
01:27:55,061 --> 01:27:57,335
Excuse me.
Look how devastated he is.

1197
01:27:57,394 --> 01:27:59,372
Don't be like that, Son.

1198
01:28:00,428 --> 01:28:02,337
It's no use now.

1199
01:28:09,328 --> 01:28:12,602
Cheer up.
It's done now.

1200
01:28:16,927 --> 01:28:18,428
Come here.

1201
01:28:27,194 --> 01:28:30,536
Wow, Fabinho.
Why will you hug Val and not me?

1202
01:28:31,261 --> 01:28:33,864
Val thinks I'm smart.
You think I'm dumb.

1203
01:28:33,927 --> 01:28:37,098
I don't think you're dumb, Son.

1204
01:28:37,694 --> 01:28:39,400
Maybe...

1205
01:28:39,461 --> 01:28:42,371
you didn't succeed because
you don't know what you want.

1206
01:28:42,428 --> 01:28:44,769
You just weren't committed.

1207
01:28:44,827 --> 01:28:46,464
Excuse me, Dona Bárbara.

1208
01:28:46,961 --> 01:28:49,633
Dona Bárbara,
I can't even talk, so nervous I am.

1209
01:28:49,694 --> 01:28:53,070
- What is it?
- Oh, God, Jéssica called.

1210
01:28:53,495 --> 01:28:56,530
- Do you know how many points she scored?
- How many?

1211
01:28:56,595 --> 01:28:59,731
Do you know
how many points she scored?

1212
01:29:00,328 --> 01:29:03,397
- Sixty-eight points!
- Sixty-eight?

1213
01:29:03,461 --> 01:29:06,064
Jéssica passed the entrance exam!

1214
01:29:06,994 --> 01:29:09,699
- Jéssica passed.
- Wow, 68.

1215
01:29:09,760 --> 01:29:12,204
- Look how nervous I am!
- Wow. Congratulations, Val.

1216
01:29:12,261 --> 01:29:14,398
- Thank you.
- Congratulations, Val.

1217
01:29:14,894 --> 01:29:17,463
- Jesus.
- Sixty-eight?

1218
01:29:17,528 --> 01:29:21,767
- I just can't believe it!
- Neither can I. It's amazing, isn't it?

1219
01:29:21,827 --> 01:29:23,567
So-

1220
01:29:23,627 --> 01:29:26,401
Impressive.
Very good. Sixty-eight is very good.

1221
01:29:26,461 --> 01:29:28,802
She said 68.

1222
01:29:30,961 --> 01:29:32,870
But, Val...

1223
01:29:32,927 --> 01:29:36,371
don't get too excited because
that was only the first-level exam.

1224
01:29:36,428 --> 01:29:38,269
- I know, ma'am.
- There's going to be another exam...

1225
01:29:38,328 --> 01:29:40,465
and the second level is much harder.

1226
01:29:40,861 --> 01:29:42,770
- I know.
- So-

1227
01:29:42,827 --> 01:29:47,329
She told me she scored 68 points,
which is a lot.

1228
01:29:47,394 --> 01:29:49,394
- No, it's very good!
- Sixty-eight!

1229
01:29:49,461 --> 01:29:53,269
But she'll have to go
through the second exam. If she fails-

1230
01:29:53,328 --> 01:29:56,601
- God willing, she'll pass the second exam.
- Of course she will.

1231
01:29:56,660 --> 01:30:00,161
And Fabinho will too, next year!

1232
01:30:00,228 --> 01:30:04,001
Right, Fabinho?
Don't be sad, my treasure.

1233
01:30:06,961 --> 01:30:08,870
Life goes on, Fabinho.

1234
01:30:09,361 --> 01:30:12,339
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1235
01:30:14,061 --> 01:30:15,868
Sixty-eight.

1236
01:30:17,027 --> 01:30:19,062
- It's a lot, isn't it?
- Yeah.

1237
01:30:19,794 --> 01:30:21,567
She studied.

1238
01:30:23,528 --> 01:30:26,199
She wouldn't do anything else.

1239
01:30:30,794 --> 01:30:33,398
If you want to pass, you have to study.

1240
01:30:33,461 --> 01:30:35,063
You have to study.

1241
01:30:36,861 --> 01:30:38,362
Come on.

1242
01:32:28,127 --> 01:32:29,627
Jéssica?

1243
01:32:31,794 --> 01:32:33,295
Honey.

1244
01:32:37,094 --> 01:32:40,697
It's Mommy.
I'm calling to say good night.

1245
01:32:44,328 --> 01:32:49,329
To say good night
and to say I'm really proud of you.

1246
01:32:51,394 --> 01:32:52,894
Now-

1247
01:32:54,228 --> 01:32:56,399
Guess where I am?

1248
01:33:01,927 --> 01:33:03,427
Can you hear it?

1249
01:33:06,328 --> 01:33:08,328
I'm in the pool!

1250
01:33:11,328 --> 01:33:15,170
Right, I am!

1251
01:33:19,393 --> 01:33:22,599
I'm very happy!

1252
01:33:23,727 --> 01:33:25,796
See you. Listen.

1253
01:33:29,393 --> 01:33:31,338
Mommy loves you.

1254
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:35,396
See you.

1255
01:34:16,627 --> 01:34:19,434
Dr. Carlos, it's 11:00 already.

1256
01:34:19,494 --> 01:34:21,995
- Come in, Val.
- Excuse me.

1257
01:34:27,327 --> 01:34:28,896
Did you take your medicine?

1258
01:34:28,961 --> 01:34:32,666
Yes. I want to congratulate you
for Jéssica.

1259
01:34:32,727 --> 01:34:34,205
Gee.

1260
01:34:34,261 --> 01:34:36,397
You raised her very well.

1261
01:34:36,460 --> 01:34:37,961
Me?

1262
01:34:44,627 --> 01:34:46,468
I also want...

1263
01:34:48,327 --> 01:34:50,327
to make an apology.

1264
01:34:50,393 --> 01:34:52,133
For what?

1265
01:34:53,228 --> 01:34:54,899
You know.

1266
01:35:03,527 --> 01:35:06,596
I'm staying in bed a little longer.

1267
01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:10,004
But-

1268
01:35:10,061 --> 01:35:12,800
What can I do for you?
Do you want anything?

1269
01:35:12,861 --> 01:35:14,429
I just want to sleep.

1270
01:35:15,660 --> 01:35:17,002
Gee.

1271
01:35:27,627 --> 01:35:29,571
Tell her the news!

1272
01:35:29,627 --> 01:35:31,536
Didn't I tell you?

1273
01:35:31,594 --> 01:35:34,129
I'm going to spend six months abroad,
living by myself.

1274
01:35:34,627 --> 01:35:36,128
- Where?
- In Australia, Val.

1275
01:35:36,194 --> 01:35:37,194
In Australia, Val.

1276
01:35:37,260 --> 01:35:39,829
- Oh, God, how far!
- Here, look.

1277
01:35:39,894 --> 01:35:42,997
- There's an amazing English course there.
- Look how pretty.

1278
01:35:43,061 --> 01:35:46,834
I don't like it. I'll miss him so much.
Six months without seeing him?

1279
01:35:46,894 --> 01:35:49,099
- Look at this beach.
- Dear Lord!

1280
01:35:49,161 --> 01:35:52,434
- Beautiful.
- Really beautiful.

1281
01:35:52,494 --> 01:35:55,802
- We're looking for a place to stay.
- But it's too far.

1282
01:35:56,127 --> 01:35:57,968
God! It's really far.

1283
01:35:58,027 --> 01:36:00,334
- Look!
- Looks like Recife.

1284
01:36:12,627 --> 01:36:14,571
Look how nice.

1285
01:36:16,293 --> 01:36:20,931
It's crochet. I bought it from Joelma,
who lives with Pamela.

1286
01:36:21,393 --> 01:36:24,599
Look how things
are getting into place.

1287
01:36:26,627 --> 01:36:28,400
God writes straight
with crooked lines.

1288
01:36:28,460 --> 01:36:31,064
This house is much better
than the other one, isn't it Jéssica?

1289
01:36:35,861 --> 01:36:37,998
Jéssica, you are still mad at me.

1290
01:36:39,227 --> 01:36:42,398
- You have to understand my side, honey.
- And you should have defended me.

1291
01:36:42,460 --> 01:36:44,132
Didn't I?

1292
01:36:44,994 --> 01:36:47,699
I'm not going to talk about it.
I don't wanna fight again.

1293
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:49,635
Dear God.

1294
01:36:57,861 --> 01:36:59,861
I thought you were so pretty.

1295
01:37:01,527 --> 01:37:04,596
So rich, with tons of presents
when you visited me.

1296
01:37:06,694 --> 01:37:09,002
You have no idea how much
I've suffered because of you.

1297
01:37:09,061 --> 01:37:11,302
And you don't know how much
I've suffered because of you.

1298
01:37:11,360 --> 01:37:13,304
You suffered because you wanted to.

1299
01:37:13,927 --> 01:37:16,768
You'd go there full of gifts,
saying this and that...

1300
01:37:16,827 --> 01:37:18,998
and then leave me there
like an idiot asking...

1301
01:37:19,061 --> 01:37:21,868
"Where is Mommy?
What time is she coming back?"

1302
01:37:23,727 --> 01:37:27,398
You don't know the half of it.
Ask your dad one day!

1303
01:37:29,227 --> 01:37:31,967
Fucking shit! Ten years, Val!
For God's sake!

1304
01:37:32,027 --> 01:37:33,834
Why didn't you go back?

1305
01:37:36,627 --> 01:37:39,628
You have no idea of my agony.
The more I didn't go...

1306
01:37:39,694 --> 01:37:44,638
the more anxious I got.
It got harder to go back.

1307
01:37:46,460 --> 01:37:49,336
But I'll tell you something.
One day, God forbid-

1308
01:37:49,393 --> 01:37:52,462
One day
you'll understand your mother!

1309
01:38:00,994 --> 01:38:02,801
Who's this boy?

1310
01:38:06,560 --> 01:38:09,004
Jéssica, I'm asking you
who this boy is.

1311
01:38:10,027 --> 01:38:13,062
Jéssica, why won't
your father talk to you?

1312
01:38:13,126 --> 01:38:15,934
I don't understand
why your father won't talk to you!

1313
01:38:19,061 --> 01:38:21,937
I'm asking who this boy is, Jéssica.

1314
01:38:26,594 --> 01:38:28,094
It's Jorge.

1315
01:38:28,427 --> 01:38:30,302
I don't know who Jorge is.

1316
01:38:34,227 --> 01:38:36,603
- It's my son!
- Please no, Jéssica.

1317
01:38:36,660 --> 01:38:39,638
Jéssica, I can't believe this!

1318
01:38:40,061 --> 01:38:42,265
And why didn't you tell me?

1319
01:38:42,327 --> 01:38:45,635
We weren't even talking, Val.
How was I going to tell you such a thing?

1320
01:38:45,694 --> 01:38:48,934
Did you leave the boy there?
Did you leave the boy there?

1321
01:38:48,994 --> 01:38:53,233
I did, Val! How was I going to study,
take exams with the boy here?

1322
01:38:53,293 --> 01:38:55,202
My God!

1323
01:38:56,527 --> 01:38:59,869
- Won't you bring him?
- I will.

1324
01:39:01,494 --> 01:39:03,938
- When I can!
- So cute.

1325
01:39:04,927 --> 01:39:06,996
- When?
- Whenever I can!

1326
01:39:11,126 --> 01:39:13,866
- Thanks, Val.
- Be careful with the suitcase.

1327
01:39:13,927 --> 01:39:15,199
Don't worry.

1328
01:39:15,260 --> 01:39:19,227
My God, a boy like you going
to the end of the world!

1329
01:39:19,994 --> 01:39:22,835
My love, my treasure!

1330
01:39:26,260 --> 01:39:28,670
Let's go, Son. We're late.

1331
01:39:29,327 --> 01:39:31,327
- Bye, Val. See you.
- Bye-bye.

1332
01:39:31,393 --> 01:39:33,234
Don't eat junk food.

1333
01:39:33,827 --> 01:39:37,703
Take care, my love.

1334
01:39:41,060 --> 01:39:42,629
I love you!

1335
01:40:23,794 --> 01:40:25,203
Give me.

1336
01:40:41,861 --> 01:40:45,327
But, Val, why?
Are you mad at me?

1337
01:40:45,393 --> 01:40:48,837
No, I want to quit.
I quit.

1338
01:40:48,894 --> 01:40:52,929
But Val, why so suddenly?
Are you mad at me?

1339
01:40:52,993 --> 01:40:54,665
No, ma'am.

1340
01:40:55,360 --> 01:40:59,270
No, Dona Bárbara.
It's-It's me, really.

1341
01:41:00,227 --> 01:41:03,637
Is it the gossiping? Or is Vandré,
the driver, saying things you don't like?

1342
01:41:03,694 --> 01:41:06,297
- No, no. It's not Vandré.
- If he's trying to-

1343
01:41:07,427 --> 01:41:10,166
No, ma'am. It's just-

1344
01:41:11,594 --> 01:41:14,435
It's just me.

1345
01:41:14,960 --> 01:41:17,905
- That's it.
- Do you want a raise?

1346
01:41:17,960 --> 01:41:21,200
- No, ma'am. It's not money.
- We can give you a raise.

1347
01:41:21,260 --> 01:41:23,101
Dona Bárbara, it's not about the money.

1348
01:41:23,160 --> 01:41:24,933
Not about the money, ma'am.

1349
01:41:28,026 --> 01:41:29,629
I feel...

1350
01:41:31,026 --> 01:41:32,766
that I need-

1351
01:41:34,960 --> 01:41:36,960
I need to...

1352
01:41:37,360 --> 01:41:39,360
stay with my daughter.

1353
01:41:39,993 --> 01:41:42,870
Take care of her. Be with her.

1354
01:41:45,060 --> 01:41:46,561
I see.

1355
01:41:47,893 --> 01:41:49,838
- You're right.
- Aren't I?

1356
01:41:52,293 --> 01:41:53,895
Oh, Val.

1357
01:41:57,193 --> 01:41:59,068
OK. I understand.

1358
01:42:00,327 --> 01:42:01,862
I understand.

1359
01:43:23,627 --> 01:43:24,865
Here!

1360
01:43:30,926 --> 01:43:32,666
This one too.

1361
01:43:35,560 --> 01:43:38,436
- There's this crap here.
- Leave it here.

1362
01:43:39,126 --> 01:43:40,865
- Thanks, Vandré!
- Don't mention it.

1363
01:43:40,926 --> 01:43:42,961
- I appreciate it.
- Call me if you need me.

1364
01:43:43,026 --> 01:43:45,197
Bye, you two, all the best!

1365
01:43:54,360 --> 01:43:56,894
What are you doing here
on a Thursday?

1366
01:44:01,793 --> 01:44:03,203
Bye.

1367
01:44:04,160 --> 01:44:05,695
I quit.

1368
01:44:09,527 --> 01:44:12,437
- You're kidding, Val.
- No, I'm serious.

1369
01:44:12,494 --> 01:44:14,130
Really?

1370
01:44:17,694 --> 01:44:19,728
I don't believe it myself.

1371
01:44:20,793 --> 01:44:22,930
Wow.

1372
01:44:22,993 --> 01:44:24,993
Boil some water.

1373
01:44:26,793 --> 01:44:29,964
- Let's have some coffee.
- OK!

1374
01:44:32,893 --> 01:44:35,962
What now?
Have you thought about the future?

1375
01:44:37,393 --> 01:44:38,893
Don't know.

1376
01:44:39,793 --> 01:44:41,703
I'll find away.

1377
01:44:45,759 --> 01:44:47,998
Take a massage course.

1378
01:44:48,660 --> 01:44:51,865
Doesn't Fabinho say
I'm the best masseuse ever?

1379
01:44:52,627 --> 01:44:54,127
Who knows?

1380
01:44:56,560 --> 01:44:58,196
It's a good idea.

1381
01:45:07,726 --> 01:45:10,637
- Look how pretty.
- I like it.

1382
01:45:10,693 --> 01:45:12,864
- Modern, isn't it?
- It is.

1383
01:45:12,926 --> 01:45:14,870
It's all different.

1384
01:45:15,193 --> 01:45:18,535
Black on white, white on black.

1385
01:45:20,260 --> 01:45:22,397
Different, just like you.

1386
01:45:22,726 --> 01:45:24,227
Nice.

1387
01:45:25,960 --> 01:45:27,767
- Modern.
- Right.

1388
01:45:29,494 --> 01:45:31,971
Look at the thermos. How lovely.

1389
01:45:32,659 --> 01:45:34,694
Lovely, lovely.

1390
01:45:38,093 --> 01:45:39,798
Chic.

1391
01:45:47,627 --> 01:45:49,070
What?

1392
01:45:52,659 --> 01:45:54,898
I stole it from Dona Bárbara.

1393
01:45:55,260 --> 01:45:57,260
You cannot be serious, Val.

1394
01:45:58,693 --> 01:46:00,069
Seriously?

1395
01:46:17,594 --> 01:46:19,662
Jéssica, now we-

1396
01:46:21,560 --> 01:46:25,436
Now that I'm home,
that we're home...

1397
01:46:28,826 --> 01:46:30,735
I was thinking.

1398
01:46:38,293 --> 01:46:40,066
Go get Jorge!

1399
01:46:42,360 --> 01:46:44,167
Bring my grandson.

1400
01:46:45,494 --> 01:46:47,472
I'll pay for the ticket.

1401
01:46:48,926 --> 01:46:50,597
Plane ticket!

1402
01:46:52,460 --> 01:46:54,199
Go get your son.

1403
01:46:56,860 --> 01:46:58,167
Go.

1404
01:46:59,793 --> 01:47:01,737
You really are a quick one,
aren't you?

1405
01:47:01,793 --> 01:47:04,862
Putting the cart
in front of the horse.

1406
01:47:07,960 --> 01:47:09,960
Are you going
to take care of him, Mother?

1407
01:49:08,659 --> 01:49:11,660
