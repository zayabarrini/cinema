That's why he's here.

And this is a special book.

It was the book my father used
to read to me when I was sick,

00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:43,968
and I used to read it
to your father.

Chapter one.

42
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:26,139
Buttercup was raised on a
small farm in the country of Florin.

43
00:02:26,605 --> 00:02:29,393
Her favourite pastimes
were riding her horse

44
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:32,396
and tormenting the farm boy
that worked there.

45
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:36,733
His name was Westley,
but she never called him that.

46
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,281
Isn't that
a wonderful beginning?

47
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:42,075
[GRANDSON]
Yeah, it's really good.

48
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:46,872
Nothing gave Buttercup as much
pleasure as ordering Westley around.

49
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:50,122
Farm Boy,
polish my horse's saddle.

50
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:53,082
I want to see my face
shining in it by morning.

51
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,164
As you wish.

52
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:01,424
[GRANDFATHER] 'As you wish'
was all he ever said to her.

53
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:06,722
Farm Boy, fill these with water.

54
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:10,221

As you wish.

56
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:18,779
That day,
she was amazed to discover

57
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:21,027
that when he was saying,
'As you wish, '

58
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:23,155
what he meant was,
'I love you.'

59
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:30,541
And even more amazing was the day
she realized she truly loved him back.

00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:27,555
Westley had no money
for marriage,

71
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:29,849
so he packed his few
belongings and left the farm

72
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,847
to seek his fortune
across the sea.

It was a very emotional time
for Buttercup.

happens to you?

every day?

[GRANDFATHER] Westley
didn't reach his destination.

84
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:22,403
His ship was attacked
by the Dread Pirate Roberts,

85
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:25,151
who never left captives alive.

that Westley was murdered...

Murdered by pirates is good.

What is that you're ripping?

reaches the castle,

And when you are, the
Prince will see you all hanged.

worrying about is your own.

Stop doing that! We can
all relax. It's almost over.

You are sure nobody's follow us?

As I told you,

00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:42,511
it would be absolutely, totally

No one in Guilder knows
what we've done

have gotten here so fast.

Out of curiosity,
why do you ask?

No reason. Suddenly, I
just happen to look behind us

What?

Probably some local fisherman out
for a pleasure cruise at night through

If you're in such a hurry, you
could lower a rope or a tree branch,

or find something useful to do.

I could do that.
I've got some rope up here.

But I do not think
you would accept my help,

[GRUNTING] No good.
I've known too many Spaniards.

275

We'll wait... wait... wait
until you're ready.

Again, thank you.

I do not mean to pry,

281
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:39,885
but you don't by any chance happen
to have six fingers on your right hand?

282
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:43,843
Do you always begin
conversations this way?

283
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:47,517
My father was slaughtered
by a six-fingered man.

284
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:55,809
He was a great sword maker,
my father.

285
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:58,853
When the six-fingered man appeared
and requested a special sword,

286
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:00,734
my father took the job.

287
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:04,985
He slaved a year
before he was done.

288
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:16,455
I've never seen its equal.

289
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:20,880
The six-fingered man
returned and demanded it,

290
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:24,303
but at one-tenth
his promised price.

291
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:26,889
My father refused.

292
00:20:26,976 --> 00:20:31,140
Without a word, the six-fingered
man slashed him through the heart.

293
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:33,892
I loved my father.

294
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:37,647
So, naturally, I challenged
his murderer to a duel.

295
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:40,149
I failed.

296
00:20:41,699 --> 00:20:44,532
The six-fingered man
leave me alive.

297
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:47,490
But he gave me this.

298
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,664
How old were you?

299
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:53,333
I was 11 years old.

300

When I was strong enough,

301
00:20:56,797 --> 00:21:00,165
I dedicated my life
to the study of fencing.

302
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:05,174
So, the next time we meet,
I will not fail.

303
00:21:06,557 --> 00:21:10,221
I will go up to the
six-fingered man and say,

but study swordplay?

than study, lately.

You see, I cannot find him.

It has been 20 years now.
I'm starting to lose confidence.

00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,915
I just work for Vizzini
to pay the bills.

311
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:37,039
There's not a lot of money
in revenge.

312
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:42,214
Well, I certainly hope
you find him someday.

313
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,462
You're ready then?

314
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,322
Whether I am or not,
you've been more than fair.

315
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:48,714
You seem a decent fellow.
I hate to kill you.

316
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:51,425
You seem a decent fellow.
I hate to die.

317
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:54,602
Begin.

318
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:29,087
You are using Bonetti's
defence against me, huh?

319
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:32,048
I thought it fitting,
considering the rocky terrain.

320
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:34,884
Naturally, you must expect
me to attack with Capo Ferro.

321
00:22:35,229 --> 00:22:39,097
Naturally. But I find that Thibault
cancels out Capo Ferro, don't you?

I admit that you are
better than I am.

Then why are you smiling?

Pick up one of those rocks.
Get behind the boulder.

In a few minutes, the man in black
will come running around the bend.

Well, I haven't fought
just one person for so long.

386

I've been specializing
in groups,

battling gangs for local
charities, that kind of thing.

Why should that make
such a... difference?

Well, you see,
you use different moves

390

[GRUNTING] when you're
fighting half a dozen people

391
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:04,764
than when you only have to be
worried about one.

I do not envy you the headache
you will have when you awake.

But in the meantime, rest
well and dream of large women.

and find out who is right
and who is dead.

But it's so simple.

All I have to do is divine
from what I know of you.

Are you the sort of man

who would put the poison into
his own goblet or his enemy's?

445

Now, a clever man would put
the poison into his own goblet

446
00:31:51,493 --> 00:31:54,736
because he would know that only a great
fool would reach for what he was given.

447
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:58,869
I'm not a great fool, so I can clearly
not choose the wine in front of you.

448
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,412
But you must have known
I was not a great fool.

You would've counted on it, so I can
clearly not choose the wine in front of me.

Not remotely.

452
00:32:08,677 --> 00:32:12,090
Because iocane comes from
Australia, as everyone knows,

453
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,797
and Australia is entirely
peopled with criminals,

454
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:17,178
and criminals are used to
having people not trust them,

as you are not trusted by me,

456

the wine in front of you.

a dizzying intellect.

Yes. Australia.

461
00:32:28,697 --> 00:32:31,337
And you must have suspected I
would have known the powder's origin,

00:32:31,408 --> 00:32:33,775
so I can clearly not choose
the wine in front of me.

You'd like to think that,
wouldn't you?

465

You've beaten my giant, which
means you're exceptionally strong,

466
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:42,783
so you could've put the poison
in your own goblet,

467
00:32:42,878 --> 00:32:44,358
trusting on your strength
to save you,

468
00:32:44,463 --> 00:32:47,125
so I can clearly not choose
the wine in front of you.

469
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:51,004
But you've also bested my Spaniard,
which means you must've studied,

470
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:54,086
and in studying, you must
have learned that man is mortal,

471
00:32:54,181 --> 00:32:57,390
so you would've put the poison
as far from yourself as possible,

472
00:32:57,476 --> 00:33:00,389
so I can clearly not choose
the wine in front of me.

00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:03,642
You're trying to trick me into
giving away something. It won't work.

It has worked!
You've given everything away.

00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:07,182
I know where the poison is.

476
00:33:07,277 --> 00:33:08,438
Then make your choice.

477

637

Good night, Westley.
Good work.

Sleep well. I'll most likely
kill you in the morning.

639
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:14,376
It was a fine time for me. I
was learning to fence, to fight,

640
00:43:14,467 --> 00:43:16,333
anything anyone would teach me.

641
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:18,964
And Roberts and I
eventually became friends.

642
00:43:19,097 --> 00:43:20,383
And then it happened.

What? Go on.

644
00:43:23,392 --> 00:43:26,009
Roberts had grown so rich
he wanted to retire,

645
00:43:26,104 --> 00:43:29,222
so he took me to his cabin
and told me a secret.

646
00:43:31,526 --> 00:43:33,893
I am not the Dread
Pirate Roberts, he said.

647
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:35,442
My name is Ryan.

648
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:38,113
I inherited the ship from the
previous Dread Pirate Roberts,

649
00:43:38,199 --> 00:43:40,190
just as you
will inherit it from me.

650
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:43,367
The man I inherited it from was not
the real Dread Pirate Roberts either.

651
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:47,618
His name was Cummerbund. The
real Roberts has been retired 15 years

652
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:49,949
and living like a king
in Patagonia. Thank you.

653
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:52,501
Then he explained the name
was the important thing

654
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:54,499
for inspiring
the necessary fear.

655
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:58,549
You see, no one would surrender
to the Dread Pirate Westley.

656
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:02,178
So, we sailed ashore,
took on an entirely new crew,

657
00:44:02,265 --> 00:44:04,176
and he stayed aboard
for a while, as first mate,

658
00:44:04,392 --> 00:44:06,508
all the time calling me Roberts.

659
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:08,718
Once the crew believed,
he left the ship,

660

and read it again to me tomorrow.

1428
01:33:18,343 --> 01:33:20,300
As you wish.

1429
01:35:16,294 --> 01:35:18,877
[STORYBOOK LOVE PLAYING]

1430
01:35:22,175 --> 01:35:26,419
Come my love
I'll tell you a tale

1431
01:35:26,971 --> 01:35:31,431
Of a boy and girl
and their love story

1432
01:35:32,435 --> 01:35:37,225
And how he loved her Oh, so much

1433
01:35:37,565 --> 01:35:42,150
And all the charms
she did possess

1434
01:35:43,071 --> 01:35:47,816
Now this did happen
once upon a time

1435
01:35:48,409 --> 01:35:52,994
When things were not so complex

1436
01:35:53,498 --> 01:35:58,243
And how he worshipped
the ground she walked

1437
01:35:58,336 --> 01:36:00,748
And when he looked in her eyes

1438
01:36:00,838 --> 01:36:03,671
He became obsessed

1439
01:36:04,342 --> 01:36:09,428
My love is like
a storybook story

1440
01:36:09,514 --> 01:36:14,634
But it's as real
as the feelings I feel

1441
01:36:14,936 --> 01:36:19,976
My love is like
a storybook story

1442
01:36:20,358 --> 01:36:25,353
But it's as real
as the feelings I feel

1443
01:36:25,905 --> 01:36:30,570
It's as real
as the feelings I feel

1444
01:36:40,586 --> 01:36:46,502
He said, Don't you know
I love you, oh, so much

1445
01:36:47,010 --> 01:36:51,345
And lay my heart
at the foot of your dress?

1446
01:36:51,431 --> 01:36:57,052
She said, Don't you know
that storybook loves

1447
01:36:57,854 --> 01:37:02,599
Always have a happy ending?

1448
01:37:03,276 --> 01:37:07,895
Then he swooped her up
just like in the books

1449
01:37:08,364 --> 01:37:12,779
And on his stallion
they rode away

1450
01:37:13,619 --> 01:37:18,580
My love is like
a storybook story

1451
01:37:18,916 --> 01:37:23,956
But it's as real
as the feelings I feel

1452
01:37:24,213 --> 01:37:29,549
My love is like
a storybook story

1453
01:37:29,635 --> 01:37:34,721
But it's as real
as the feelings I feel

1454
01:37:35,266 --> 01:37:40,102
It's as real
as the feelings I feel
