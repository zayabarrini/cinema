1
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,430
No!

2
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:33,430
There she is.
There she is.

3
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,440
There she is.

4
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:34,890
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

5
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:39,390
<i>I've traveled over
half our state
to be here tonight.</i>

6
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,910
<i>I couldn't get away sooner
because my new well
was coming in</i>

7
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:44,900
<i>at Coyote Hills
and I had to see about it.</i>

8
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:47,900
<i>That well is now flowing
at 2,000 barrels</i>

9
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:51,910
<i>and it's paying me
an income of $5,000 a week.</i>

10
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:55,410
I have two others drilling
and I have 16 producing
at Antelope,

11
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:59,910
so, ladies and gentlemen,
if I say I'm an oilman,
you will agree.

12
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:05,420
Now, you have
a great chance here,

13
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:08,420
but bear in mind
you could lose it all
if you're not careful.

14
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:10,840
Out of all men
that beg for a chance
to drill your lots,

15
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:14,350
maybe one in 20
will be oilmen.

16
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:15,350
The rest will be
speculators,

17
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:18,350
that's men trying
to get between you
and the oilmen

18
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:21,850
to get some of
the money that ought,
by rights, come to you.

19
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:24,860
Even if you find
one that has money
and means to drill,

20
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:27,360
he'll maybe know
nothing about drilling.

21
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,360
He'll have to
hire the job out
on contract,

22
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,360
and then you're
depending on
a contractor,

23
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,860
who'll rush
the job through

24
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:35,880
so he can get
another contract
just as quick as he can.

25
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,370
This is the way
that this works.

26
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:40,370
What is your offer?
We're wasting time.

27
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:42,370
Please!

28
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:47,880
I do my own drilling.

29
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,920
And the men that work
for me, work for me,
and they are men I know.

30
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,920
I make it
my business to be there
and to see their work.

31
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,920
I don't lose my tools in
the hole and spend months
fishing for them.

32
00:15:58,920 --> 00:15:59,920
I don't botch
the cementing off

33
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:03,940
and let water in the hole
and ruin the whole lease.

34
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:05,900
I'm a family man.

35
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,400
I run a family business.

36
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,900
This is my son
and my partner,
H.W. Plainview.

37
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:16,410
We offer you the bond
of family that very few
oilmen can understand.

38
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:21,410
I'm fixed like
no other company
in this field

39
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:24,920
and that's because
my Coyote Hills well
has just come in.

40
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,420
I have a string of tools
all ready to put to work.

41
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,420
I can load a rig onto trucks
and have them here in a week.

42
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,920
I have business connections,
so I can get the lumber
for the derricks.

43
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:36,940
Such things go by friendship
in a rush like this.

44
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:40,930
And this is why
I can guarantee
to start drilling

45
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:43,930
and to put up
the cash to
back my word.

46
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,450
I assure you,
ladies and gentlemen,

47
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,940
no matter what
the others promise to do,

48
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:51,940
when it comes
to the showdown,
they won't be there.

49
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:57,460
Sit down! Sit down,
you have no right...

50
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:59,570
Let us discuss
what the man has to say.

51
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:01,070
Prescott, do you
trust this man?

52
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:02,570
Let's discuss
what he has to say.

53
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:04,570
There's logic
to what he's saying.

54
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:08,130
How does he know?
My lot is there!

55
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:11,130
Two or three years,
it could be ten years!

56
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:13,130
We gain nothing
by losing our heads!

57
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:14,630
Look at that
well out there!

58
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:17,130
Nobody's
losing their heads.

59
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:19,650
You have no business
being here!

60
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,310
Sit that woman down, sir!

61
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:26,310
You can sit down.

62
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:29,980
Mr. Plainview!
Please, Mr. Plainview.

63
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:31,980
No, Mr. Plainview!
No, where are you going?

64
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,480
I don't need
the lease. Thank you.

65
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:35,000
But we need you.

66
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:37,490
Too much confusion.
Thank you for your time.

67
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:38,990
No, no, there's
no confusion.

68
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:42,990
I wouldn't take
the lease if you
gave it to me as a gift.

69
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:56,520
<i>Mr. Bankside,
I'm not going to
waste your time.</i>

70
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:59,010
<i>I'd certainly appreciate it
if you didn't waste mine.</i>

71
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:03,630
Now, if you wish to sign with
me, we can have a well
drilling within 10 days.

72
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:07,630
Your lot is
further north from
the discovery well up here.

73
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:10,200
That means
we'll probably
have to dig deeper.

74
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:12,690
And if there's as much oil
here as I think there is,

75
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:15,690
it'll be harder to reach,
but once we find it,
we can take it right out.

76
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:20,200
We have to act quickly,
because very soon
these fields will be dry.

77
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,700
I need you to know
what you want to do.

78
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:26,200
Now, because of the distance
from the discovery well,

79
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,210
I'll pay you
a smaller royalty
than you'd get down there

80
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:32,210
but I'm prepared to give you
a $1,000 bonus on your lot.

81
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:33,710
What kind of royalty
are you talking about?

82
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:38,720
One-sixth,
plus a guarantee to start
drilling within 10 days.

83
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,720
Now, that's something
you won't find
anywhere else.

84
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:52,730
What age are
your children, ma'am?

85
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:55,400
Ten and twelve.

86
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:59,770
Mr. Plainview,
a question, sir.
Where is your wife?

87
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,740
She died in childbirth,
Mrs. Bankside.

88
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,740
So it's just me
and my son now.

89
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,620
It's coming in, boss!

90
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,620
Hear it?

91
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:46,230
Mr. Plainview?

92
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:47,730
Yes?

93
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:52,240
Are you Daniel Plainview?

94
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,240
Yes.

95
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,760
What can I
do for you?

96
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,250
You look for oil.

97
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,250
That's right.

98
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:08,260
What do you pay for
a place that has it?

99
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,760
Well, that depends.

100
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,260
What does it
depend on?

101
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:16,260
On a lot of things.

102
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:21,270
If I told you I knew a place
that had oil where land
could be bought cheaply,

103
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:24,270
what do you think
that would be worth?

104
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:25,770
Oh, I think that

105
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,290
you should let me know
what you know

106
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,280
and then we'll try
and work something out.

107
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,700
Can I sit down?
Please.

108
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:50,210
What church
do you belong to?

109
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,220
I...

110
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:02,730
I enjoy all faiths.
I don't belong to one
church in particular.

111
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:06,730
I like them all.
I like everything.
Where are you from?

112
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:08,230
That would be
telling you.

113
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:10,230
That's what I
want to sell you.

114
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,240
What are you
doing in Signal Hill?

115
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,740
We have oil,
and it seeps
through the ground.

116
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:20,240
Do you want to pay me
to know where it is?

117
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,760
Just 'cause
there's something
on the ground

118
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,250
doesn't mean
there's anything
beneath it.

119
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:26,250
Why did Standard Oil
buy up land?

120
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:30,750
Is it in California?

121
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:33,270
Maybe.

122
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,760
How much land
did they buy?

123
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:38,180
I'd like it better
if you didn't think
I was stupid.

124
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:49,190
Why did you
come to me?

125
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:51,190
You just brought
this well in.

126
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:53,190
That's right.

127
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,710
Yes, so just give me
$500 in cash right now

128
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:00,200
and I'll tell you
where it is.

129
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,700
I'll tell you
what I'll do, son.
I'll give you $100 now,

130
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:07,710
and if it proves to
be a promising lease,
then give you a $1,000 bonus.

131
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:09,680
Six hundred dollars.

132
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,680
Tell me one thing
to help me decide.

133
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,180
What else have you
got up there?

134
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,800
What do you grow?

135
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:20,800
We have a big ranch,
but it's mostly rocks.

136
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:23,320
Plant things.
Nothing will grow
but weeds.

137
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:24,690
What makes
you think it's up?

138
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:28,150
Is there sulfur around?
Or alkali deposits?

139
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:31,370
Alkali nearby.
I don't know sulfur.

140
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:39,290
Is that your son?

141
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:41,290
Yes.

142
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:43,830
Hi.
        Hi.

143
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:50,090
Who are you?
I'm Fletcher Hamilton.

144
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:52,100
Nice to meet you, son.
What's your name?

145
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:53,590
What do you do?

146
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:56,890
I work with
Mr. Plainview.

147
00:22:57,390 --> 00:22:59,390
Here's $500, son.

148
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:03,400
You tell me
something worth hearing,
this money's yours.

149
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:10,950
I come from a town
called Little Boston
in Isabella County.

150
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:17,580
This is us, here.
Spur station here
at Little Boston.

151
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:20,580
The Sunday ranch
is what you're
looking for.

152
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,080
There's a sheep trail
that takes you there.

153
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:26,090
It's a mile out of town
headed west, not far.

154
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:30,090
Just through a small pass here
near the base of the hills.

155
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:34,090
You'll pass a church
and just follow
the sheep trail.

156
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,110
Where's Standard
buying up?

157
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,100
Here and here.

158
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,100
Your family name
is Sunday, yes?
            That's right.

159
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,600
How many's
in your family?

160
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:48,120
My father and
mother and sisters
and my brother Eli.

161
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:50,610
How many sisters
do you have?
      Two.

162
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:53,110
What's your name?
                 Paul.

163
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:56,620
Does any of your family
know about the oil that
you say is there?

164
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:58,120
I don't know.

165
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:00,620
My uncle always said
there was oil there,

166
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:03,120
but I don't know
what they heard
or what they think.

167
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,620
What do you grow?

168
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:07,140
It's goats.
It's a goat farm.

169
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:10,130
I told you,
nothing grows
but weeds.

170
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:12,630
Is there water?
         It's salty.

171
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:16,050
You drill a well,
it's hard not
to get saltwater.

172
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:21,570
The oil is there.
I'm telling you.

173
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:29,570
I want to go now, so...
You can stay tonight.

174
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:31,570
No, I want to go now.
I want to leave.

175
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:35,070
Listen, Paul.

176
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:40,080
If I travel all the way
out there and I find that
you've been lying to me,

177
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,080
I'm going to find you
and I'm going to take
more than my money back.

178
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,080
Is that all right
with you?

179
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:48,080
Yes, sir.
All right, then.

180
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:50,100
Nice luck to you.
God bless.

181
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:52,090
And to you,
young man.

182
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:33,690
- There's someone coming.
- Thank you, Mary.

183
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,700
Good evening.

184
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,200
Good evening.

185
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:53,710
My name's Daniel Plainview.
This is my son, H.W.

186
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:56,710
Are you hunting?
Hunting for quail.

187
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:59,720
We're told there might be
a good place to camp up
near the Sunday ranch.

188
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,720
This is the Sunday ranch.
You can camp here.

189
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:05,010
Thank you.
Do you have water?
              Yes.

190
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:07,510
We heard
there was an earthquake
up here a few days ago.

191
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:09,510
Is that right?
Yes.

192
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:11,510
Your family?

193
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:13,510
Yeah, all fine.
Thank you.

194
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,020
We have goat's milk,
if you'd like.

195
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:18,520
That would be fine.

196
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:22,020
Now,

197
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:26,040
if we set our tent
away over there,

198
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:28,030
we'd be out of
your way over there.

199
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:29,030
That's fine.

200
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:31,530
Ruth! Help these men
and bring them some water.

201
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:33,030
No! H.W.

202
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:38,540
Mr. Plainview,
would you like
that milk now?

203
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:40,040
That would be fine.
Thank you.

204
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,540
Mary! Bring them
some milk.

205
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:44,040
My family will
help you set up
your tent.

206
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:46,560
No, please.
We set ourselves on
this camping trip.

207
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:48,550
We have to do
the camping.

208
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:50,050
Hurry up!

209
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:54,550
Do you have bread?

210
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:57,060
We have potatoes.

211
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:58,560
Potatoes would be nice,
thank you.

212
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,060
I'll have them
boil you up
some potatoes.

213
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:02,560
That's all right.
I thought maybe
we'd make a fire.

214
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:05,070
I wanted to work
with my son on
making a fire.

215
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:06,980
All right. My son,
Eli, will bring you
some wood.

216
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:09,000
Thank you so much
for your hospitality,
Mr. Sunday.

217
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:09,990
Yes.

218
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:11,490
And we'll be
out of your way.

219
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:13,990
We're just hunting
        for quail.
Yes.

220
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:18,500
I'm sorry we
don't have any bread.
                 No, no, no.

221
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:21,000
Corn doesn't fill out
in the hills here.
It's mostly rock.

222
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:24,000
We don't have room
to raise the grain.

223
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:30,020
Thank you,
young lady.

224
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,580
My name is Eli.

225
00:28:58,090 --> 00:29:00,100
Yes, you're Eli Sunday.

226
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:02,590
Welcome.

227
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:08,090
H.W.
  Eli.

228
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,600
You're hunting quail?

229
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,100
That's right.

230
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:22,610
We will bring dinner.

231
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:24,610
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

232
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:48,980
Dad!

233
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,980
Dad, look at my shoe.

234
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:20,010
That's earthquake oil.
Set loose.

235
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:44,580
<i>So...</i>

236
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:47,590
<i>So?</i>

237
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:50,590
<i>So, so.</i>

238
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:54,680
<i>If there's anything here,
we take it to the sea.</i>

239
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:58,680
What we do is we build
a pipeline to Port Hueneme
or Santa Paula,

240
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,180
it's about 100 miles,

241
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:04,860
and we do a deal
with Union Oil.
This is what we do.

242
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:07,870
Then we don't need
the railroads and their
shipping costs anymore.

243
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:09,360
You see?

244
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,360
Yeah.

245
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,860
You see that?

246
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:17,130
Yeah.

247
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,120
Then we're making money.
We're making the real money.

248
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:21,120
What we should be making.
Not just...

249
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:23,620
Not just throwing it away
on shipping costs.

250
00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:26,140
Otherwise,
it's just mud.

251
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:33,050
How much are we
going to pay them?

252
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:35,050
Who's that?

253
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:40,070
The Sunday family.

254
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:43,060
I'm not going to
give them oil prices.

255
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,260
I'll give them
quail prices.

256
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:55,190
If we could
take a few minutes,

257
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:58,690
there's something
I'd very much like to
talk with you about.

258
00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:02,200
Mother, would you
take the girls
outside, please?

259
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:17,210
I believe in
plain speaking, so...

260
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:21,710
This is a beautiful ranch.
I love hunting for quail.

261
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:24,730
My boy has been sick,
you know.
He needs fresh air.

262
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:28,220
Doctors all say
he needs plentiful
fresh air.

263
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,720
So,

264
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:37,730
what would you say
would be a fair price
for this lot, Abel?

265
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:41,230
To buy this place?
    That's right.

266
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,240
Take a moment.

267
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:55,680
I'm sorry.
I don't know.
        Six dollars an acre.

268
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:59,170
Six dollars?
Thank you, Eli.

269
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:01,170
And then with
the improvements

270
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:03,170
to the ranch over
the years at $500...

271
00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:05,680
I'd like to offer you
$3,700 for this ranch.

272
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:09,180
That's $3,700.
                     No.

273
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:11,680
The Lord has sent
this man here, Eli.

274
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,180
Yes, I believe He has.

275
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:15,180
My offer to you
is $3,700.

276
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:17,200
What is it that
brought you here, sir?

277
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:20,190
The Good Lord's guidance.

278
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:21,690
Now, of course, within that...
           What about our oil?

279
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:23,450
...we're going to
develop a lease.

280
00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:26,460
What's that?

281
00:34:26,450 --> 00:34:27,950
What about our oil?

282
00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:30,950
Uh, what about it?

283
00:34:31,450 --> 00:34:33,450
We have oil here.
That's worth something.

284
00:34:33,450 --> 00:34:35,960
Oh, do you have someone
who can drill for it?

285
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,960
Do you think
there's oil here?
           I know there is.

286
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:40,460
It's very
expensive to drill.

287
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:42,460
To get it up and
out of the ground.
You ever tried that before?

288
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:44,460
How much is it?
Costly.

289
00:34:44,970 --> 00:34:47,980
Well, our oil sits right up
on top of the ground.

290
00:34:48,970 --> 00:34:50,470
I believe that's
called seepage.

291
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:52,470
Doesn't necessarily mean
there's anything underneath.

292
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:54,470
What would you
        give us for it?
I don't know.

293
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,990
Something you don't know.

294
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:57,480
That's right.

295
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:02,870
What would you like, Eli?

296
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:07,040
Ten thousand dollars.

297
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,620
For what?

298
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:14,130
For my church.

299
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,570
That's good.

300
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:30,310
That's a good one.

301
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:34,480
Well, uh...

302
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:37,980
If we decide to drill
for oil and if the well
begins to produce,

303
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:40,000
I'll give your church
a $5,000 signing bonus.

304
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:41,490
Ten thousand.

305
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:43,490
Do you want to find
someone else that's going
to come here and drill, Eli?

306
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:46,490
Make the investment
and do all the hard work
that goes into it?

307
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:50,500
I can just as easily
hunt for quail on another
ranch as I can here, so...

308
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,500
Though I'll happily be
a supporter of your church
for as long as I can.

309
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,500
For the bonus only.

310
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:02,840
Now, as it happens,
I do have some connections
in the drilling business

311
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,340
who might help
get us started.

312
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:06,770
How do you feel
about this, Abel?

313
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,530
Yes. What Eli says.

314
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:13,020
Well, good! Let's draw up
some contracts and let's...

315
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:15,020
Let's give it a try.

316
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:19,360
Appreciate your help
with this, Eli.

317
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,240
-         Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

318
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,740
Real estate?
Yes.

319
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:35,630
Yes, I'd like to
talk to you.

320
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:37,630
I'm looking for
some land.

321
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:40,130
I just bought
the Sunday ranch.

322
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:42,130
And, well,

323
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:44,670
where's the map?

324
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:47,670
Where are the hills
behind the Sunday ranch?

325
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:51,170
That's here.
It's the Bandy tract.
He has over 600 acres.

326
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:55,690
Bandy, 600.

327
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,180
What about this?

328
00:36:57,180 --> 00:37:02,180
A.C. Maude, Blodget,
Redlick, Carr.

329
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:04,690
What's it held at?

330
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:06,190
Six dollars an acre.

331
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:08,690
Six.

332
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:10,690
What about this?

333
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:14,200
That's the Belvins,
and that could
be got, I'm sure.

334
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,700
Can everything
around here be got?

335
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:21,000
Sure.

336
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:49,070
Paul Sunday turned out
to be a good friend of ours.

337
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:51,070
That's right.

338
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:55,570
Well, you get here
just as soon as you can.

339
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:58,070
Bring Fred English.

340
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,210
Good enough.

341
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,580
Thank you, porter.

342
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:08,050
H.W., how are you?
Fine, and you?

343
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:09,890
Pretty good.
            Where's your dad?
He's inside.

344
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:11,670
You fellas are
a long way from
Signal Hill.

345
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:13,560
Hello, Plainview.
Hello, Gene.

346
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,980
Good to see you.
   Charlie.

347
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,640
On your way
somewhere else?

348
00:38:17,650 --> 00:38:20,660
Passing through.
Looking around.

349
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:23,680
Funny to see you.
Funny, isn't it?

350
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:26,490
You boys are a regular
family business.

351
00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:27,990
You boys are
a little late.

352
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:30,990
What did you find?
I found some
interesting prospects.

353
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:32,490
Hmm.

354
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:33,490
Did you hear
Standard bought up?

355
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:36,530
Mostly in the north, so far.
          That's what I hear.

356
00:38:36,530 --> 00:38:40,030
I'm gonna tell you, Gene,
if you're gonna
make a play, look east.

357
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:42,540
I'd rather it be you
than someone else.

358
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:45,200
This mud around here
has been taken.

359
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:49,050
It must be easy when you
have such a cute face
to carry around with you.

360
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,040
Telling me how
handsome my son is?

361
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:52,270
Well, that I am.

362
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:54,260
That's very nice.
Thank you.

363
00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:55,780
Good luck, Gene.
                Take care.

364
00:38:55,770 --> 00:38:57,050
Like I said, go east.

365
00:38:57,970 --> 00:39:00,270
H.W.

366
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:02,970
I'll be your lawyer
if you need to
draw up a contract.

367
00:39:02,970 --> 00:39:04,890
Make sure you don't
get swindled, boy.

368
00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:07,230
Get half what
your dad's making.

369
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:19,250
How's that?

370
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,420
What are those men doing?

371
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:41,100
They're just guys
that are working for us.

372
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:43,610
They're just
looking around.

373
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,930
How much money
can we make?

374
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,370
I don't know.
It depends.

375
00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:00,910
One thousand dollars?

376
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:12,540
Mary said that
her father beats her
if she doesn't pray.

377
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:21,630
Mary, she's the, uh,
smaller one?

378
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:25,640
Yes, she is.

379
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:41,950
Everyone here?
      Very successful.

380
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:43,960
But?

381
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:47,460
There were a few
vacant lots and
one holdout.

382
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:48,960
Who?
  William Bandy.

383
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,960
...eight. Who's he?

384
00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:52,980
He's an old man
who homesteaded here.

385
00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:55,970
Lives with his grandson.
He said he'd like
to speak with you.

386
00:40:55,970 --> 00:40:57,470
Is he here?

387
00:40:57,470 --> 00:41:00,470
No, he'd like you to
come visit with him.

388
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:02,480
He's boosting his price.

389
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:05,980
He said he'd like to
speak with whoever
is doing the buying.

390
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,480
Well, let him wait.
He'll come around.
Let's go.

391
00:41:16,490 --> 00:41:18,490
Ladies and gentlemen?

392
00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:21,490
Ladies and gentlemen.

393
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:25,010
Thank you so much
for visiting with us
this evening.

394
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,830
Now, I've traveled across
half our state to be here
and to see about this land.

395
00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:33,290
<i>Now, I daresay some
of you might have heard</i>

396
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:37,290
<i>some of the more
extravagant rumors
about what my plans are,</i>

397
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:40,300
<i>so I just thought
you'd like to
hear it from me.</i>

398
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:43,300
<i>This is the face.
It's no great mystery.</i>

399
00:41:45,850 --> 00:41:50,860
<i>I'm an oilman,
ladies and gentlemen,</i>

400
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:54,360
<i>I have numerous concerns
spread across this state.</i>

401
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:57,860
<i>I have many wells
flowing at many thousand
barrels per day,</i>

402
00:41:57,870 --> 00:42:01,880
<i>so I like to think of
myself as an oilman.</i>

403
00:42:01,870 --> 00:42:03,870
<i>As an oilman,
I hope that
you'll forgive</i>

404
00:42:03,870 --> 00:42:08,370
<i>just good old-fashioned
plain speaking.</i>

405
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:12,000
<i>Now, this work that we do
is very much
a family enterprise.</i>

406
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,510
<i>I work side by side
with my wonderful son, H.W.</i>

407
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,000
<i>I think one or two of you
might have met him already.</i>

408
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,000
<i>And I encourage my men
to bring their families,
as well.</i>

409
00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:26,020
<i>Of course, it makes
for an ever so much more
rewarding life for them.</i>

410
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:30,010
<i>Family means children,
and children means education.</i>

411
00:42:30,010 --> 00:42:34,020
<i>So, wherever we set up camp,
education is a necessity,</i>

412
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:36,020
<i>and we're just so happy
to take care of that.</i>

413
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:38,850
So let's build
a wonderful school
in Little Boston.

414
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:40,870
These children are
the future that
we strive for,

415
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:44,360
and so they should have
the very best of things.

416
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:46,360
Now, something else,

417
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:50,370
and please don't be insulted
if I speak about this. Bread.

418
00:42:50,370 --> 00:42:52,870
Let's talk about bread.

419
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:56,370
Now, to my mind, it's an
abomination to consider

420
00:42:56,370 --> 00:43:00,880
that any man, woman,
or child in this
magnificent country of ours

421
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:05,180
should have to look upon
a loaf of bread as a luxury.

422
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:07,180
<i>We're going to dig
water wells here,</i>

423
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:08,680
<i>and water wells
means irrigation.</i>

424
00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:11,200
<i>Irrigation means cultivation.</i>

425
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:15,190
<i>We're going to raise crops
here where before it just
simply wasn't possible.</i>

426
00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:17,860
<i>You're going to have
more grain than you'll
know what to do with,</i>

427
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:19,860
<i>and bread will
be coming right
out of your ears, ma'am.</i>

428
00:43:21,370 --> 00:43:26,160
<i>New roads, agriculture,
employment, education.</i>

429
00:43:26,650 --> 00:43:28,650
These are just
a few of the things
we can offer you,

430
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:30,670
and I assure you,
ladies and gentlemen,

431
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:32,710
that if we do find oil here,

432
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:36,210
and I think there's
a very good chance
that we will,

433
00:43:36,210 --> 00:43:41,220
this community of yours
will not only survive,
it will flourish.

434
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:46,310
I'd be happy to
answer any questions
that you might have. Yes?

435
00:43:46,310 --> 00:43:49,060
Will the new road
lead to the church?

436
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:53,930
That'll be the first
place that it leads.
Thank you, Eli. Anyone else?

437
00:43:53,930 --> 00:43:57,850
Well, if anything comes up,
I'm pretty easy to find.
You just come visit with me.

438
00:43:57,850 --> 00:44:00,020
Thank you so much
for your time,
and good night.

I'll bring them up

Good morning.
Good morning.

00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:26,500

Everything's good.

All the men are
provided for?

462
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:31,470
Of course.

463
00:46:33,470 --> 00:46:35,310
Spirits seem high.

464
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:41,180
Is there anything
that you need from me?

465
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:47,020
Anything the church
can do for you?

466
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:48,520
I don't believe so.
No. Thank you.

467
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:51,020
I understand you've
asked the people
to gather around

468
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:52,520
and watch the well
begin tomorrow.
Is that right?

469
00:46:53,030 --> 00:46:55,030
That's right.
I will bless the well.

470
00:46:56,530 --> 00:46:59,200
Before you begin,
you should introduce me.

471
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,700
You'll see me walk up
towards the oil well,
and when I...

472
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:03,200
The derrick.

473
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:07,210
You'll see me walk up,
and then you could
say my name.

474
00:47:07,210 --> 00:47:09,120
When you walk up?

475
00:47:09,130 --> 00:47:13,140
Yes. You'll see me walk up,
and then you could say,

476
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:18,630
"The proud son of
these hills who tended
his Father's flock,"

477
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:21,310
and then you
could say my name.

478
00:47:22,310 --> 00:47:24,820
That's fine.

479
00:47:24,810 --> 00:47:28,560
And what happens then?
Well, then we start the drill.

480
00:47:31,570 --> 00:47:35,080
It's a simple blessing,
Daniel, but an important one.

481
00:47:35,570 --> 00:47:38,570
It's just a few words.
It won't take long.

482
00:47:39,570 --> 00:47:40,570
What time?

483
00:47:40,570 --> 00:47:42,070
What time's
good for you, Eli?

484
00:47:42,580 --> 00:47:43,840
4:00.

485
00:47:43,830 --> 00:47:45,330
Well, let's make it
4:00 then.

486
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:48,330
My thanks for your visit.

487
00:47:48,330 --> 00:47:50,220
Good day. Thank you.

488
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:07,600
Afternoon,
everyone.

489
00:48:08,850 --> 00:48:10,850
Come with me.

490
00:48:15,990 --> 00:48:19,490
I thank you all so much
for visiting with us
at this time.

491
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:21,510
I've had the pleasure of
meeting some of you

492
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:23,500
and I hope very much in
the months to come,

493
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:26,500
I'll be able to visit with
each and every one of you.

494
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,500
I'm better at digging
holes in the ground
than making speeches,

495
00:48:29,510 --> 00:48:31,020
so let's forget the speech
for this evening,

496
00:48:31,510 --> 00:48:33,040
just make it
a simple blessing.

497
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:35,040
You see, one man
doesn't prospect
from the ground.

498
00:48:35,050 --> 00:48:39,060
It takes a whole
community of good people,
such as yourselves,

499
00:48:39,050 --> 00:48:42,050
and this is good.
We stay together.

500
00:48:42,550 --> 00:48:44,350
We pray together,
we work together,

501
00:48:44,350 --> 00:48:47,220
and if the Good Lord
smiles kindly on
our endeavor,

502
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:49,730
we share in
the wealth together.

503
00:48:52,230 --> 00:48:54,230
Now, before we spud in
Mary's Well Number One,

504
00:48:54,230 --> 00:48:57,730
named for the lovely
Miss Mary Sunday,
here by my side,

505
00:48:57,730 --> 00:49:00,870
a proud daughter
of these hills,

506
00:49:00,870 --> 00:49:04,570
I'd just like to say God bless
these honest labors of ours,
and, of course,

507
00:49:04,570 --> 00:49:06,580
God bless you all.

508
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:08,080
Amen.

509
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:09,080
Now go.

510
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:15,800
Won't be a minute.

511
00:49:19,310 --> 00:49:21,150
Fast as you can, H.W.

512
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:26,680
Are you ready
to do this?

513
00:49:36,490 --> 00:49:38,990
That's it,
ladies and gentlemen!

514
00:49:43,110 --> 00:49:47,030
Al Rose has very generously
provided some refreshments
for this occasion

515
00:49:47,030 --> 00:49:49,530
out of his own pocket.
Thank you, Al.

516
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:55,040
If you'll all just
care to help yourselves,
I'll be back in a minute.

517
00:51:07,950 --> 00:51:09,660
Mary. Oh...

518
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,750
Mary Sunday.

519
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:16,840
Do you like
your new dress?

520
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:18,340
Yes. Thank you.

521
00:51:18,340 --> 00:51:22,090
You're welcome.
I thought you'd like it.

522
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:24,220
Are you happy
I came here?

523
00:51:24,210 --> 00:51:26,210
Yes.

524
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:30,390
Your daddy doesn't
hit you anymore,
does he? Does he now?

525
00:51:30,890 --> 00:51:33,390
Better not, right?

526
00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:35,890
I'll take care of you.

527
00:51:36,890 --> 00:51:39,390
No more hitting, right?

528
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:41,910
No more hitting. Now go.

529
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:45,280
Go and play some more
and don't come back.

530
00:51:54,410 --> 00:51:55,910
Daniel?

531
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:03,430
It's okay, H.W.
Go back to sleep.
Go on. Go back to sleep.

532
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:07,420
Daniel.

533
00:52:09,430 --> 00:52:10,940
Daniel.

534
00:52:13,930 --> 00:52:14,930
Daniel!

535
00:52:16,430 --> 00:52:17,930
Daniel!

536
00:52:17,930 --> 00:52:18,930
What?

537
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:22,940
Lost a man
down the well.

538
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:29,860
What man?
Joe Gundha.

539
00:52:31,870 --> 00:52:34,380
Did I know him?
No.

540
00:52:34,370 --> 00:52:35,250
What happened?

541
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:44,510
Pick it up.

542
00:52:45,010 --> 00:52:46,510
Set the brake.

543
00:52:47,010 --> 00:52:47,930
Tie it down.

544
00:52:47,930 --> 00:52:49,050
Tie it on.

545
00:52:53,770 --> 00:52:54,640
Shit!

546
00:52:56,890 --> 00:53:00,390
God damn it.
Where's the body?

547
00:53:00,390 --> 00:53:01,890
They're
fishing it out now.

548
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:03,410
All right.

549
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:07,900
Where's the bit?

550
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:09,400
It's on the deck.

551
00:53:52,610 --> 00:53:55,610
Clean him up.
Put some clothes on him.

552
00:53:56,620 --> 00:53:58,120
And...

553
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:01,120
Set up a tent.

554
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:06,120
Anyone goes down
into the cellar,
you tell somebody. Yes?

555
00:54:06,130 --> 00:54:07,640
Yes, sir.
            Yes, sir.

556
00:54:11,130 --> 00:54:13,550
Shut down till midday.

557
00:54:44,830 --> 00:54:49,880
And I had a vision.
Yes, last night,
I had a vision

558
00:54:50,390 --> 00:54:52,890
and I felt God's breath
move through me.

559
00:54:56,890 --> 00:55:00,900
And it rolled down
into my stomach.

560
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:04,900
It sloshed around.

561
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:09,900
And my stomach
spoke in a whisper,
not a shout,

562
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:17,410
"Touch this woman
with your hands
and caress her." Yes.

563
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:23,920
My dear Mrs. Hunter,

564
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:27,420
you have arthritis,
don't you?

565
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:29,420
Yes, I do, Eli.
Yes.

566
00:55:29,430 --> 00:55:34,440
The devil is in your hands,
and I will suck it out.

567
00:55:34,430 --> 00:55:38,930
Now, I will not
cast this ghost out
with a fever

568
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:43,950
for the new spirit inside me
has shown me I have
a new way to communicate.

569
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:48,360
It is a gentle whisper.

570
00:55:54,870 --> 00:55:57,370
Get out of here, ghost.

571
00:55:57,370 --> 00:55:58,870
Cast out.

572
00:55:59,870 --> 00:56:02,370
Get out of here, ghost.

573
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:06,380
Get out.

574
00:56:06,380 --> 00:56:09,380
Get out of here, ghost.

575
00:56:11,380 --> 00:56:14,890
Get out of here, ghost.

576
00:56:14,890 --> 00:56:18,890
...and enter this
woman's body now.
    Get out of here, ghost.

577
00:56:18,890 --> 00:56:22,890
Get out of here.
Don't you dare turn
around and come back.

578
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:26,400
For if you do,

579
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:32,400
all the armies of my boot
will kick you in the teeth

580
00:56:32,410 --> 00:56:35,920
and you will be cast up
and thrown in the dirt

581
00:56:35,910 --> 00:56:38,410
and thrust back
to perdition!

582
00:56:38,410 --> 00:56:42,410
And as long as
I have teeth,
I will bite you,

583
00:56:42,420 --> 00:56:46,430
and if I have no teeth,
I will gum you!

584
00:56:46,420 --> 00:56:50,340
And as long as
I have fists,
I will bash you!

585
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:55,010
Now, get out of here, ghost!
Get out of here, ghost!

586
00:56:55,010 --> 00:56:58,010
Get out of here, ghost!

587
00:57:01,430 --> 00:57:03,440
And it left!

588
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:05,850
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

589
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:09,860
Praise the Lord
and his holy days!
Praise God!

590
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:13,360
Amen! Thank you.
Thank you, Jesus.
       Thank you, God.

591
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:16,870
My dear Mrs. Hunter.

592
00:57:20,070 --> 00:57:21,570
Dance with me.

593
00:57:23,070 --> 00:57:24,570
Aw!

594
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:27,090
Dance.

595
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,510
Thanks for coming.
  It was a wonderful sermon.

596
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:34,000
Will I see you tomorrow?
          Yes.

597
00:57:39,010 --> 00:57:40,010
Eli.

598
00:57:42,510 --> 00:57:45,510
Had a tragedy at
the well last night.

599
00:57:46,510 --> 00:57:48,510
Yes, I heard.

600
00:57:48,510 --> 00:57:50,520
Joe Gundha was a man
of considerable faith.

601
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:52,520
So if you wish to
say a few words,

602
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:55,020
his burial is
at noon tomorrow.

603
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:58,020
Daniel, this accident
could have been avoided.

604
00:57:58,020 --> 00:58:00,530
It is terrible to
think of that well

605
00:58:00,530 --> 00:58:02,030
working away out there...
           These men work
           in 12-hour shifts.

606
00:58:02,030 --> 00:58:03,530
...unblessed.
        They need their rest.

607
00:58:03,530 --> 00:58:05,530
If they don't have it,
they start to make
stupid mistakes.

608
00:58:05,530 --> 00:58:08,030
I've seen the men drinking.
Don't you think that has
something to do with this?

609
00:58:08,030 --> 00:58:10,030
We need these men
well-rested to
bring in this well.

610
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:12,050
They can't get that
if they're up here
listening to your gospel,

611
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:14,540
and then the well can't
produce and blow gold
all over the place.

612
00:58:14,540 --> 00:58:16,540
I wish I had more time
with Joe Gundha.

613
00:58:16,540 --> 00:58:18,040
More could have been done.

614
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:23,050
Then the well can't
produce and blow gold
all over the place.

615
00:58:28,970 --> 00:58:31,470
Now, would you see to it
that his personal possessions

616
00:58:31,470 --> 00:58:33,980
find their way
back to his family, please?

617
00:58:33,980 --> 00:58:35,980
Thank you.

618
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:38,980
Heard you were planning
some renovations.

619
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:41,980
Yes, our congregation
is growing strongly.

620
00:58:42,990 --> 00:58:44,500
We need more room.

621
00:58:44,990 --> 00:58:46,990
That was one goddamn
hell of a show.

622
00:58:48,490 --> 00:58:50,990
We were happy to
have you, Daniel.

623
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:46,360
Gas, gas, gas!

624
01:00:55,330 --> 01:00:58,590
Lights out! Wait here.
Wait here. Lights out!

625
01:01:08,350 --> 01:01:10,350
Put that fire out!

626
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:41,160
Is he hurt? H.W.!
Hand him down to me!

627
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:48,000
Hand him down!
                        Here.

628
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:53,840
Got him?
            I've got him!

629
01:02:01,150 --> 01:02:02,650
Oh, God.

630
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:19,580
Come on.

631
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:33,100
Open the door.

632
01:02:48,060 --> 01:02:51,570
Let go. There you go.
You're safe. You're safe.

633
01:02:51,570 --> 01:02:56,820
You're safe now.
I got you here.
You're safe. Let go, son.

634
01:02:56,820 --> 01:02:59,820
Tell me where it hurts.
Tell me where it hurts.
Tell me where...

635
01:02:59,830 --> 01:03:01,340
- Did you see this?
- No.

636
01:03:01,330 --> 01:03:02,830
Tell me where it hurts.

637
01:03:02,830 --> 01:03:05,250
Where does it hurt you?
Where does it hurt you?

638
01:03:05,250 --> 01:03:06,750
I can't hear my voice.

639
01:03:06,750 --> 01:03:09,830
Were you hit
in the head?

640
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:11,850
Were you hit
in the head? Tell me!

641
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:14,140
You have to tell me
if you were!

642
01:03:14,140 --> 01:03:16,510
I can't hear my voice.

643
01:03:25,350 --> 01:03:28,350
I have to go and
deal with this now.
You wait here for me.

644
01:03:28,350 --> 01:03:29,850
You understand?
You wait here for me.

645
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:31,870
I'll be back.
I'll be back
in a minute.

646
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:33,410
Wait here.
Don't leave!

647
01:03:33,580 --> 01:03:35,090
I'm going to
take care of you. Wait.

648
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:38,110
Stay here, son.
I'm going to fix this.

649
01:03:38,110 --> 01:03:40,110
Don't leave!
  You're going to be fine!
  Wait for me here!

650
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:41,460
Hold him down.
Hold him down.

651
01:03:41,450 --> 01:03:43,000
Don't leave!

652
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:48,010
Got to break
the cables, Daniel!

653
01:03:48,010 --> 01:03:50,010
Get me a hammer!

654
01:03:56,520 --> 01:03:58,030
Get me a hammer!

655
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:02,520
Here you go.

656
01:04:27,630 --> 01:04:29,130
Get back!

657
01:05:06,700 --> 01:05:08,200
Michael!
Sir!

658
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:10,710
Take Dave and two
of the fellas,
pick up some hoses...

659
01:05:10,710 --> 01:05:14,460
Billy, protect the roof.
Don't wait before
it gets too hot.

660
01:05:37,070 --> 01:05:39,580
What are you looking
so miserable about?

661
01:05:39,570 --> 01:05:42,570
There's a whole ocean
of oil under our feet!

662
01:05:42,570 --> 01:05:45,570
No one can get at it
except for me.

663
01:06:31,870 --> 01:06:33,870
H.W. okay?

664
01:06:34,870 --> 01:06:36,370
No, he isn't.

665
01:06:38,380 --> 01:06:39,880
Where is he?

666
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:40,880
Mess room.

667
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:09,600
Ah.

668
01:08:20,110 --> 01:08:24,120
That's enough now.
That's enough, H.W.
That's enough.

669
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:29,620
Do you hear me?
Can you hear me in there?

670
01:08:35,130 --> 01:08:37,130
That's enough.

671
01:08:49,390 --> 01:08:51,890
- Grab his legs.
- I have his legs.

672
01:08:51,890 --> 01:08:53,890
No. Nope.
No, lad.

673
01:08:59,650 --> 01:09:01,190
Give me that.

674
01:09:05,490 --> 01:09:06,770
Steady. That's it.

675
01:09:06,780 --> 01:09:09,290
Easy, boy. Easy.
                Soon be over.

676
01:09:09,280 --> 01:09:13,280
Yeah, and that's good.
Now the other side.
Turn him over.

677
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:17,840
Almost done.

678
01:09:21,670 --> 01:09:23,620
That's it.

679
01:09:23,630 --> 01:09:26,390
Come here.
It's over. It's over.

680
01:11:32,770 --> 01:11:35,770
Who do we know
in San Francisco

681
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:39,780
or Los Angeles,
who could work with...

682
01:11:42,280 --> 01:11:46,280
You know, we could...
Someone, a teacher for H.W.

683
01:11:50,290 --> 01:11:53,790
How could you
figure out that?

684
01:11:53,790 --> 01:11:57,800
Now, call...
God damn it,
what's his name?

685
01:11:57,800 --> 01:12:01,300
Bob Brody
in San Francisco?

686
01:12:01,300 --> 01:12:04,300
Call Bob Brody
and get someone
down here.

687
01:12:11,030 --> 01:12:13,030
I'll do it right away.

688
01:13:20,710 --> 01:13:22,760
When do we get
our money, Daniel?

689
01:13:28,890 --> 01:13:32,520
Aren't you a healer?
And a vessel for
the Holy Spirit?

690
01:13:32,530 --> 01:13:35,570
When are you coming over
and make my son hear again?

691
01:13:35,560 --> 01:13:37,230
Can't you do that?

692
01:13:37,230 --> 01:13:38,950
If you had let
me bless the well,
this wouldn't have happened.

693
01:13:38,950 --> 01:13:40,450
Daniel.

694
01:13:40,450 --> 01:13:41,950
You shouldn't have
done that.

695
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:47,460
You owe the Church of
the Third Revelation $5,000

696
01:13:47,460 --> 01:13:50,290
as part of the arrangement
that we made!

697
01:14:00,340 --> 01:14:05,230
Don't even try it,
you little runt!
You splash around in here.

698
01:14:11,810 --> 01:14:13,820
That's it,
that's it.

699
01:14:25,830 --> 01:14:28,330
I'm going to
bury you underground, Eli.

700
01:14:30,330 --> 01:14:32,330
Oh. Oh.

701
01:14:32,340 --> 01:14:35,350
I'm going to
bury you underground.

702
01:15:06,740 --> 01:15:09,550
You are a stupid man, Abel.

703
01:15:11,460 --> 01:15:15,830
You've let someone
come in here and
walk all over us.

704
01:15:18,330 --> 01:15:22,830
You let him in
and do his work here,

705
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:26,930
and you are a stupid man
for what we could have had.

706
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:30,930
I followed
His word, Eli.
I tried.

707
01:15:30,930 --> 01:15:33,430
You didn't do
anything but sit down.

708
01:15:34,930 --> 01:15:37,430
You're lazy,
and you're stupid.

709
01:15:40,940 --> 01:15:45,440
Do you think God
is going to save you
for being stupid?

710
01:15:47,830 --> 01:15:50,660
He doesn't save
stupid people, Abel.

711
01:15:53,870 --> 01:15:58,510
I will tear you apart
for what you've done,
you stupid man!

712
01:15:58,500 --> 01:16:01,010
How did he come here?
Do you really know? I know!

713
01:16:01,010 --> 01:16:03,510
Son, don't do this, please!
                  Be quiet!

714
01:16:03,510 --> 01:16:08,510
Shut your mouth, Abel!
It was your stupid son!

715
01:16:09,010 --> 01:16:13,020
It was Paul who told him
to come here. I know it.

716
01:16:13,020 --> 01:16:14,520
He went to him and he said,

717
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:19,520
"My stupid, weak father
will give away his lots.

718
01:16:19,530 --> 01:16:23,040
"Go and take him."
And you let it happen.

719
01:16:27,530 --> 01:16:30,530
A stupid father
to a stupid son.

720
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:38,090
Get out of there!

721
01:17:08,490 --> 01:17:10,490
Can I help you?

722
01:17:11,990 --> 01:17:13,490
Daniel?

723
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:15,510
Who's that?

724
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:17,500
My name is Henry.

725
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,500
Yeah?

726
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,000
I'm Henry.

727
01:17:23,510 --> 01:17:26,020
What can I do for you?

728
01:17:28,510 --> 01:17:32,510
I'm Henry Plainview.
I'm from Fond du Lac.

729
01:17:34,930 --> 01:17:38,940
I'm your brother,
from another mother.

730
01:17:40,940 --> 01:17:42,940
Ernest is my father.

731
01:17:47,450 --> 01:17:48,950
Who are you?

732
01:17:49,950 --> 01:17:51,450
Henry.

733
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:20,480
Mary Branch?
Is that your mother?

734
01:18:20,980 --> 01:18:22,980
Yes, sir,
that's right.

735
01:18:24,980 --> 01:18:30,490
I read about your
gusher in the paper,
about your success.

736
01:18:30,490 --> 01:18:33,490
You heard
about my strike?
You just show up?

737
01:18:34,490 --> 01:18:36,410
Our father's dead.

738
01:18:37,910 --> 01:18:41,420
Ernest died, I heard.
I wanted to find you.

739
01:18:41,420 --> 01:18:42,920
When?

740
01:18:42,920 --> 01:18:46,420
Three months ago.
I got a letter
from Annabelle.

741
01:18:47,420 --> 01:18:49,420
My sister,
Annabelle?

742
01:18:51,430 --> 01:18:52,930
Where is she?

743
01:18:53,430 --> 01:18:54,930
Still at home.
Fond du Lac.

744
01:18:56,930 --> 01:19:00,430
You came all the way
from Wisconsin to
tell me this?

745
01:19:00,440 --> 01:19:03,450
I'm coming from
New Mexico.
I've been there.

746
01:19:04,940 --> 01:19:06,440
I came to find you.

747
01:19:07,940 --> 01:19:09,940
Did you know about me?

748
01:19:17,950 --> 01:19:20,960
Do you have
identification?

749
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:22,960
Do you have
this letter?

750
01:19:46,230 --> 01:19:48,230
Where are you
          coming from?
From New Mexico.

751
01:19:48,230 --> 01:19:50,820
Yes, I know,
but from where?

752
01:19:50,820 --> 01:19:54,820
Silver City.
I've been there
for two years.

753
01:19:54,820 --> 01:19:59,830
I was trying drilling
of my own for years.

754
01:19:59,830 --> 01:20:04,330
Getting leases in Texas.
Louisiana.

755
01:20:04,330 --> 01:20:06,330
Anything that produced?

756
01:20:06,340 --> 01:20:09,350
No.
Not like your success, no.

757
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:18,600
Are you married?
No.

758
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:23,600
I spent time in jail.
I had a stretch of
very bad time.

759
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:28,110
I had nothing.
I was picked up
in Louisiana.

760
01:20:28,110 --> 01:20:32,110
I worked on a chain gang
for six months
building roads.

761
01:20:32,610 --> 01:20:35,610
That was a very hard time.

762
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:41,120
Are you married?

763
01:20:42,620 --> 01:20:45,070
What were you
in jail for?

764
01:20:45,070 --> 01:20:49,580
Believe it or not,
for all the terrible things
I've gotten myself into,

765
01:20:49,580 --> 01:20:53,080
when they picked me up,
I hadn't done anything.

766
01:20:53,080 --> 01:20:57,080
But I've done
my share of things

767
01:20:59,090 --> 01:21:01,590
that shouldn't
be talked about.

768
01:21:24,410 --> 01:21:27,410
Drink it.
Drink it!

769
01:22:10,040 --> 01:22:11,040
Come on.

770
01:22:42,740 --> 01:22:44,240
So...

771
01:22:48,750 --> 01:22:50,750
What do you want, Henry?

772
01:22:53,250 --> 01:22:54,750
Nothing.

773
01:22:57,760 --> 01:22:59,760
If you can
spare something,

774
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:01,760
I can work for
you in any way.

775
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:07,260
I know I'll keep moving,
before long, to get back
to Fond du Lac.

776
01:23:07,270 --> 01:23:09,780
Do you have
any money?
                        Some.

777
01:23:10,770 --> 01:23:12,770
Not much.
Just answer me directly.

778
01:23:12,770 --> 01:23:16,770
You say "nothing,"
then you say you'd
like to stay and work.

779
01:23:16,780 --> 01:23:21,790
And it's better, I'd just
like to hear you say
you'd like to be here.

780
01:23:22,780 --> 01:23:24,780
I'd like to be here.

781
01:23:30,210 --> 01:23:35,720
I'm a good worker.
I worked cable tool rigs,
built railroads.

782
01:23:37,710 --> 01:23:39,710
I won't need any favors.

783
01:23:44,720 --> 01:23:46,220
Good.

784
01:24:11,580 --> 01:24:13,860
<i>What did
my mother know?</i>

785
01:24:16,370 --> 01:24:18,670
<i>I don't know.</i>

786
01:24:18,670 --> 01:24:23,370
<i>I don't know if she knew
and looked the other way,
if she never knew.</i>

787
01:24:25,880 --> 01:24:27,880
<i>Why did you leave?</i>

788
01:24:29,880 --> 01:24:32,880
<i>I know you didn't
get on with our father.</i>

789
01:24:38,190 --> 01:24:41,690
I worked for
Geological Survey
and went to Kansas.

790
01:24:44,200 --> 01:24:47,210
I couldn't stay there.
I just couldn't.

791
01:24:48,700 --> 01:24:51,700
I don't like to
explain myself.

792
01:24:57,710 --> 01:24:59,710
Are you an
angry man, Henry?

793
01:25:00,210 --> 01:25:02,710
About what?

794
01:25:02,710 --> 01:25:06,220
Are you envious?
Do you get envious?

795
01:25:07,720 --> 01:25:09,640
I don't think so, no.

796
01:25:14,140 --> 01:25:16,640
I have a competition in me.

797
01:25:17,650 --> 01:25:20,160
I want no one else
to succeed.

798
01:25:25,150 --> 01:25:27,150
I hate most people.

799
01:25:27,160 --> 01:25:29,670
That part of me
is gone.

800
01:25:30,660 --> 01:25:33,660
Working and not succeeding,

801
01:25:33,660 --> 01:25:37,660
all my failures
have left me...

802
01:25:40,670 --> 01:25:42,670
I just don't care.

803
01:25:44,170 --> 01:25:48,680
Well, if it's in me,
it's in you.

804
01:25:48,680 --> 01:25:54,180
There are times when
I look at people and
I see nothing worth liking.

805
01:25:59,690 --> 01:26:04,190
I want to earn enough money
I can get away from everyone.

806
01:26:09,110 --> 01:26:11,620
What will you do
about your boy?

807
01:26:19,120 --> 01:26:20,620
I don't know.

808
01:26:22,630 --> 01:26:25,130
Maybe it'll change.

809
01:26:25,130 --> 01:26:27,630
Does your sound
come back to you?
I don't know.

810
01:26:27,630 --> 01:26:29,630
Maybe no one knows that.

811
01:26:29,630 --> 01:26:31,640
Doctor might not know that.

812
01:26:31,640 --> 01:26:33,640
Where's his mother?

813
01:26:39,640 --> 01:26:42,650
I don't want to talk
about those things.

814
01:26:46,150 --> 01:26:48,150
I see the worst
in people, Henry.

815
01:26:50,160 --> 01:26:54,170
I don't need to
look past seeing them
to get all I need.

816
01:26:56,160 --> 01:27:00,160
I've built up my
hatreds over the years,
little by little.

817
01:27:04,170 --> 01:27:07,170
Having you here gives me
a second breath of life.

818
01:27:08,670 --> 01:27:11,170
I can't keep
doing this on my own

819
01:27:14,680 --> 01:27:19,680
with these people.

820
01:27:59,390 --> 01:28:01,840
Daniel! Daniel,
wake up! Daniel!

821
01:29:39,570 --> 01:29:40,570
Uh...

822
01:29:44,080 --> 01:29:47,580
Just have to go
and have a word
with the conductor.

823
01:29:48,580 --> 01:29:50,580
I'll be right back.

824
01:29:50,590 --> 01:29:55,600
You stay here.
You understand?
You stay here.

825
01:29:56,590 --> 01:29:58,590
I'll be right back.

826
01:30:50,100 --> 01:30:50,820
H.W.!

827
01:30:50,810 --> 01:30:52,930
No! No!

828
01:30:54,430 --> 01:30:55,930
No!

829
01:31:05,440 --> 01:31:07,440
Tilford!
         Plainview.

830
01:31:07,450 --> 01:31:09,460
This is my brother,
Henry Plainview
from Fond du Lac.

831
01:31:09,950 --> 01:31:11,450
H.M. Tilford.
Pleasure.

832
01:31:11,450 --> 01:31:13,950
Henry Plainview.
J.J. Carter.

833
01:31:15,950 --> 01:31:17,450
So...

834
01:31:17,460 --> 01:31:18,970
Shall we?
Yes.

835
01:31:27,470 --> 01:31:28,890
How's your boy?

836
01:31:29,880 --> 01:31:30,880
Thank you for asking.

837
01:31:30,890 --> 01:31:32,900
Is there anything
we can do?

838
01:31:33,390 --> 01:31:35,270
Thanks for asking
is enough.

839
01:31:37,280 --> 01:31:39,150
So what are your plans?

840
01:31:41,150 --> 01:31:44,160
Is this about buying up
my tracts here?

841
01:31:44,150 --> 01:31:45,650
Yes.

842
01:31:45,650 --> 01:31:48,290
The cable was about
my Coyote Hills lease.

843
01:31:48,290 --> 01:31:50,290
We'd like that, too.

844
01:31:50,290 --> 01:31:52,790
What's your offer
on Coyote Hills?

845
01:31:52,790 --> 01:31:55,040
We'll offer
150,000 for
full title.

846
01:31:55,040 --> 01:31:58,040
That's a deal.
What's next?

847
01:31:58,050 --> 01:32:02,890
You have 11,000 acres
in Little Boston.
You have one proven well

848
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:04,330
that was damaged...
I have three wells proven.

849
01:32:04,340 --> 01:32:08,850
You haven't been
paying attention.
That's three proven wells.

850
01:32:12,840 --> 01:32:14,840
We'll make you a millionaire
while you're sitting here

851
01:32:14,850 --> 01:32:17,360
from one minute
to the next.

852
01:32:18,850 --> 01:32:21,850
And what else
would I do
with myself?

853
01:32:23,350 --> 01:32:25,360
Are you asking me?

854
01:32:25,360 --> 01:32:27,360
What else
would I do
with myself?

855
01:32:28,360 --> 01:32:30,860
Take care of your son.

856
01:32:32,360 --> 01:32:34,860
I don't know
what you would do.

857
01:32:37,290 --> 01:32:39,800
If you were me
and Standard offered
to buy what you had

858
01:32:39,790 --> 01:32:42,540
for a million dollars,
why? So, why?

859
01:32:44,040 --> 01:32:45,540
You know why.

860
01:32:45,540 --> 01:32:47,040
Yeah, you fellas
should just scratch
around in the dirt

861
01:32:47,050 --> 01:32:48,050
and find it like
the rest of us,

862
01:32:48,550 --> 01:32:50,550
instead of buying up
someone else's hard work.

863
01:32:50,550 --> 01:32:52,720
I've scratched
around the dirt, son.

864
01:32:52,720 --> 01:32:54,720
You going to change
your shipping costs?

865
01:32:54,720 --> 01:32:56,220
We don't dictate
shipping costs.

866
01:32:56,220 --> 01:32:57,720
That's railroad business.

867
01:32:57,720 --> 01:33:00,720
Oh, you don't
own the railroads?

868
01:33:05,230 --> 01:33:08,230
'Course you do.
Of course you do.

869
01:33:09,730 --> 01:33:12,240
Where you going
to put it all?

870
01:33:13,240 --> 01:33:14,740
Where?

871
01:33:16,240 --> 01:33:20,740
Build a pipeline?
Make a deal with
Union Oil? Be my guest.

872
01:33:20,750 --> 01:33:22,260
But if you
can't pull it off,

873
01:33:22,250 --> 01:33:27,330
you've got an ocean
of oil under your feet
with nowhere to go.

874
01:33:27,340 --> 01:33:32,350
Why not turn it over to us?
We'll make you rich.

875
01:33:32,340 --> 01:33:34,340
You spend time
with your boy.

876
01:33:35,840 --> 01:33:37,840
It's a great discovery.

877
01:33:38,850 --> 01:33:40,850
Now, let us help you.

878
01:33:50,160 --> 01:33:53,160
Did you just tell me
how to run my family?

879
01:33:53,160 --> 01:33:55,660
It might be more
important now that
you've proven the field

880
01:33:55,660 --> 01:33:57,660
and we're offering
to buy you out.

881
01:33:57,670 --> 01:33:59,680
One night
I'm going to come to you,
inside of your house,

882
01:33:59,670 --> 01:34:02,920
or wherever you're sleeping,
and I'm going to
cut your throat.

883
01:34:02,920 --> 01:34:04,920
What?

884
01:34:04,920 --> 01:34:06,290
What are you talking about?
Have you gone crazy?

885
01:34:06,290 --> 01:34:07,790
Did you hear
  what I said?
I heard what you said,

886
01:34:07,790 --> 01:34:10,290
why did you say it?
You don't tell me
about my son.

887
01:34:10,300 --> 01:34:12,310
Why are you acting insane
and threatening
to cut my throat?

888
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:15,850
You don't tell
           me about my son.
I'm not telling you anything!

889
01:34:15,850 --> 01:34:16,850
I'm asking you
to be reasonable.

890
01:34:17,350 --> 01:34:19,690
If I've offended you,
I apologize.

891
01:34:19,690 --> 01:34:21,720
You'll see what I can do.

892
01:34:29,500 --> 01:34:33,980
This parcel here is
the 3,000-acre ranch
owned by B.L. Harper.

893
01:34:33,990 --> 01:34:36,500
This is San Luis
Obispo County land.

894
01:34:36,490 --> 01:34:38,490
And from here to the coast,
it's all Union Oil.

895
01:34:38,490 --> 01:34:41,490
What's this?
Why don't I own this?

896
01:34:44,500 --> 01:34:47,010
Why don't I own this?

897
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:50,000
That's the Bandy tract.

898
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:53,000
He was the holdout,
when we were
doing the buying.

899
01:34:53,500 --> 01:34:55,510
He had hoped to
speak with you.

900
01:35:00,010 --> 01:35:03,510
Can't you just
build the pipeline
around this tract?

901
01:35:06,520 --> 01:35:10,520
Can I build around 50 miles
of Tehachapi mountains?

902
01:35:10,520 --> 01:35:13,520
Don't be thick in
front of me, Al.

903
01:35:13,520 --> 01:35:17,530
I can go to him again.
    No, I'll go and talk
    to the man.

904
01:35:17,530 --> 01:35:20,530
I'll talk to him.
Show you how it's done.

905
01:35:24,540 --> 01:35:27,050
All right.
Pack it up, Henry.

906
01:35:36,880 --> 01:35:38,880
How big is his room?

907
01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:40,880
He's sharing
with another boy.

908
01:35:41,390 --> 01:35:43,900
Who?
      An older boy.
      About 12.

909
01:35:43,890 --> 01:35:47,390
He's been there
for a year.
Named Ballard.

910
01:35:52,400 --> 01:35:53,400
How big is the room?

911
01:35:53,900 --> 01:35:56,900
Oh, it's a fair size.
Got enough space.

912
01:35:58,900 --> 01:36:02,240
Are you taking Henry
with you to meet Union Oil?

913
01:36:15,420 --> 01:36:17,420
Are you the son
of William Bandy?

914
01:36:17,420 --> 01:36:18,920
Grandson.

915
01:36:19,420 --> 01:36:20,920
Is he here?
No, he's out.

916
01:36:20,930 --> 01:36:22,440
Where is he?

917
01:36:22,430 --> 01:36:25,260
Told you, he's out.
Now, what do you want?

918
01:36:28,820 --> 01:36:32,820
I'm Daniel Plainview.
I want to talk with him
about his property.

919
01:36:32,820 --> 01:36:34,820
About what?

920
01:36:34,820 --> 01:36:37,770
I believe I'll talk
with him about that.

921
01:36:38,280 --> 01:36:40,790
You're that oilman,
aren't you?
          That's right.

922
01:36:40,780 --> 01:36:42,530
We don't want you
drilling out here.

923
01:36:42,530 --> 01:36:46,170
I don't want it either.
Now, when will he be back?

924
01:36:46,170 --> 01:36:47,670
Few days.

925
01:36:47,670 --> 01:36:50,040
Tell him I'd like
to speak with him.
Not about drilling.

926
01:36:50,040 --> 01:36:52,540
And I'll be back
in a week.

927
01:39:11,260 --> 01:39:13,260
Put that in a glass case.

928
01:39:14,270 --> 01:39:16,780
Here's to Union Oil.

929
01:39:17,270 --> 01:39:18,270
Hundred miles of pipeline,

930
01:39:18,270 --> 01:39:20,770
and all the independent
producers of this great state.

931
01:39:20,770 --> 01:39:21,520
Cheers.

932
01:39:46,760 --> 01:39:49,630
<i>There's that house
in Fond du Lac</i>

933
01:39:51,640 --> 01:39:54,650
<i>that John Hollister built.
    Do you remember it?
Mmm.</i>

934
01:39:57,780 --> 01:40:01,290
I thought as a boy
that was the most beautiful
house I'd ever seen,

935
01:40:01,280 --> 01:40:03,280
and I wanted it.

936
01:40:03,780 --> 01:40:06,070
I wanted to live in it.

937
01:40:06,070 --> 01:40:07,570
And eat in it.

938
01:40:08,570 --> 01:40:10,070
And clean it.

939
01:40:13,070 --> 01:40:17,580
And even as a boy,
I wanted to have children
to run around in it.

940
01:40:19,210 --> 01:40:21,710
You can have anything you'd
like now, Daniel.

941
01:40:22,720 --> 01:40:24,720
And you should.

942
01:40:25,220 --> 01:40:27,220
Where are you
going to build it?

943
01:40:27,220 --> 01:40:29,720
Here, maybe.
Near the ocean.

944
01:40:32,730 --> 01:40:35,140
Would you make it
look like that house?

945
01:40:40,150 --> 01:40:42,900
I think if I saw
that house now,
it'd make me sick.

946
01:40:50,030 --> 01:40:52,530
We can eat and
get some women.

947
01:40:55,580 --> 01:40:57,580
Take them to
the Peachtree dance.

948
01:41:01,090 --> 01:41:05,040
I say get liquored up
and take them to
the Peachtree dance.

949
01:41:08,050 --> 01:41:09,560
Yeah.

950
01:42:28,380 --> 01:42:30,890
Can I have
some money, please?

951
01:42:37,890 --> 01:42:40,400
Can I have
some money, please?

952
01:43:29,440 --> 01:43:31,940
I want you to
tell me something.

953
01:43:35,940 --> 01:43:37,940
What?

954
01:43:37,950 --> 01:43:41,460
What's the name of the farm
next to the Hill House?

955
01:43:52,380 --> 01:43:56,880
What was the name of the farm
next to the Hill House?

956
01:44:00,890 --> 01:44:03,900
I can't remember...
Who are you?

957
01:44:06,890 --> 01:44:08,390
I'll leave, Daniel.

958
01:44:10,390 --> 01:44:11,890
Who are you?

959
01:44:15,400 --> 01:44:16,730
I'm no one.

960
01:44:17,650 --> 01:44:20,150
Just let me
get up and go.

961
01:44:22,660 --> 01:44:24,660
Do I have a brother?

962
01:44:28,660 --> 01:44:33,670
I met a man
in King City who said
he was your brother.

963
01:44:36,050 --> 01:44:39,560
We were friends
for months.

964
01:44:40,560 --> 01:44:42,560
Working in King City.

965
01:44:45,060 --> 01:44:48,060
And he wanted
to make his way
to you, Daniel.

966
01:44:49,070 --> 01:44:51,070
We didn't have any money.

967
01:44:56,070 --> 01:44:58,570
He died of tuberculosis.

968
01:44:59,580 --> 01:45:01,580
He wasn't harmed.

969
01:45:02,580 --> 01:45:05,080
Wasn't killed,
nothing bad.

970
01:45:06,580 --> 01:45:09,090
But he told me about you,

971
01:45:12,090 --> 01:45:14,590
and I just took his story,

972
01:45:18,100 --> 01:45:20,110
used his diary.

973
01:45:23,600 --> 01:45:24,600
Daniel.

974
01:45:26,100 --> 01:45:29,610
Daniel, I'm your friend.

975
01:45:31,610 --> 01:45:34,110
I'm not trying to hurt you.

976
01:45:34,110 --> 01:45:35,480
Never.

977
01:45:36,480 --> 01:45:38,280
Just survive.

978
01:45:38,650 --> 01:45:39,650
No!

979
01:48:49,670 --> 01:48:51,170
Who is it?

980
01:48:52,180 --> 01:48:53,690
I'm Bandy.

981
01:49:06,610 --> 01:49:08,610
Yes. Yes.

982
01:49:09,110 --> 01:49:10,110
Um...

983
01:49:10,610 --> 01:49:12,610
William Bandy.

984
01:49:15,620 --> 01:49:18,540
Yeah, I'd like to
lease your land.

985
01:49:21,040 --> 01:49:24,540
I had asked for you
to come and talk
to me before.

986
01:49:24,540 --> 01:49:26,590
When you were
leasing land.

987
01:49:28,100 --> 01:49:30,110
That's right, yes.

988
01:49:31,600 --> 01:49:34,270
My boy's been
very sick, you know.

989
01:49:35,270 --> 01:49:37,770
This was before
your boy got sick.

990
01:49:40,770 --> 01:49:45,440
Now, I know that
you would like to
build a pipeline

991
01:49:45,450 --> 01:49:48,460
through my property.

992
01:49:48,450 --> 01:49:50,480
Is that right,
what I've heard?

993
01:49:50,480 --> 01:49:52,480
It's absolutely right.
And, uh,

994
01:49:52,990 --> 01:49:53,990
well...

995
01:49:55,490 --> 01:49:58,740
Eight inch pipe.
It could be buried
with your consent.

996
01:49:58,740 --> 01:50:01,240
I guarantee you
absolutely no disruption...

997
01:50:01,250 --> 01:50:02,760
God.

998
01:50:04,250 --> 01:50:06,970
God has told me
what you must do.

999
01:50:11,470 --> 01:50:14,090
And what is that?

1000
01:50:14,090 --> 01:50:18,140
You should be washed
in the blood of Jesus Christ.

1001
01:50:19,650 --> 01:50:21,650
Oh, but I am.

1002
01:50:23,150 --> 01:50:26,150
I have been washed,
Mr. Bandy. I have been.

1003
01:50:26,150 --> 01:50:28,850
It's your only way
to salvation.

1004
01:50:29,360 --> 01:50:31,860
And your only way
for what you want.

1005
01:50:33,860 --> 01:50:37,530
You can take it
at the Church of
the Third Revelation.

1006
01:50:39,530 --> 01:50:41,530
I'll pay you $3,000.

1007
01:50:44,540 --> 01:50:46,960
I'd like you to be
part of our church.

1008
01:50:48,960 --> 01:50:50,960
I'll pay you $5,000.

1009
01:50:51,930 --> 01:50:53,430
Be baptized.

1010
01:50:54,930 --> 01:50:58,930
Be forgiven for the sin
that you've done.

1011
01:51:02,940 --> 01:51:07,940
What sin are you
referring to, Mr. Bandy?

1012
01:51:08,950 --> 01:51:11,070
My sin of drilling?

1013
01:52:01,780 --> 01:52:05,780
<i>I truly wish
everyone could be
saved, don't you?</i>

1014
01:52:05,790 --> 01:52:07,800
<i>Yes.</i>

1015
01:52:07,790 --> 01:52:11,290
<i>I am afraid that's
just not the case.</i>

1016
01:52:11,290 --> 01:52:15,790
The doctrine of
universal salvation
is a lie, is it not?

1017
01:52:15,800 --> 01:52:18,810
It's a lie.
It's a lie.

1018
01:52:18,800 --> 01:52:23,300
I wish everyone could be
saved, but they won't.
No, they won't.

1019
01:52:23,300 --> 01:52:27,220
You will never
be saved if you...

1020
01:52:27,220 --> 01:52:29,220
Reject the blood.

1021
01:52:30,230 --> 01:52:32,230
Good.

1022
01:52:32,230 --> 01:52:36,730
Now, is there a sinner here
looking for salvation?

1023
01:52:39,240 --> 01:52:41,250
A new member?

1024
01:52:45,210 --> 01:52:47,210
I'll ask it again.

1025
01:52:49,380 --> 01:52:51,880
Is there a sinner here
looking for God?

1026
01:52:51,880 --> 01:52:53,550
Yes.

1027
01:52:53,550 --> 01:52:54,550
Oh.

1028
01:52:57,550 --> 01:52:58,550
Allow me.

1029
01:53:01,060 --> 01:53:03,890
Thank you for coming,
brother Daniel.

1030
01:53:05,900 --> 01:53:08,410
Thank you, Eli.

1031
01:53:08,900 --> 01:53:13,900
We have a sinner with us here
who wishes for salvation!

1032
01:53:13,900 --> 01:53:17,410
Daniel, are you a sinner?
               Yes.

1033
01:53:17,410 --> 01:53:20,410
The Lord can't
hear you, Daniel.

1034
01:53:20,410 --> 01:53:24,910
Say it to him. Go ahead
and speak to him.
It's all right.

1035
01:53:24,920 --> 01:53:27,430
Yes.
Down on your knees.

1036
01:53:27,420 --> 01:53:29,420
Pray to him.

1037
01:53:30,420 --> 01:53:34,920
Look up to the sky
and say it.

1038
01:53:37,260 --> 01:53:40,260
What do you
want me to say?

1039
01:53:40,760 --> 01:53:45,270
Daniel, you've come here
and you've brought
good and wealth,

1040
01:53:45,270 --> 01:53:49,270
but you have also brought
your bad habits
as a backslider.

1041
01:53:49,270 --> 01:53:53,780
You've lusted after women,
and you have abandoned
your child.

1042
01:53:53,780 --> 01:53:56,780
Your child,
that you raised,
you have abandoned

1043
01:53:56,780 --> 01:53:59,280
all because he was sick
and you have sinned.

1044
01:53:59,780 --> 01:54:01,780
So say it now.
I am a sinner.

1045
01:54:01,790 --> 01:54:03,800
I am a sinner.
Say it louder.

1046
01:54:03,790 --> 01:54:06,790
I am a sinner.
        I am a sinner.

1047
01:54:06,790 --> 01:54:08,790
Louder, Daniel!
I am a sinner!

1048
01:54:08,790 --> 01:54:11,630
I am a sinner.
I am sorry, Lord.

1049
01:54:11,630 --> 01:54:14,130
I am sorry, Lord.
I want the blood.

1050
01:54:14,130 --> 01:54:17,420
I want the blood.
           You have abandoned
           your child.

1051
01:54:18,420 --> 01:54:19,420
I have abandoned my child.

1052
01:54:19,420 --> 01:54:21,920
I will never backslide.
     I will never backslide.

1053
01:54:21,920 --> 01:54:24,920
I was lost,
but now I am found.

1054
01:54:25,430 --> 01:54:28,940
I was lost,
      but now I'm found.
I have abandoned my child.

1055
01:54:30,930 --> 01:54:33,930
Say it.
Say it.

1056
01:54:33,930 --> 01:54:37,440
I abandoned my child.
Say it louder.
Say it louder!

1057
01:54:37,440 --> 01:54:39,440
I've abandoned my child!

1058
01:54:40,440 --> 01:54:42,940
I've abandoned my child!

1059
01:54:42,940 --> 01:54:44,940
I've abandoned my boy!

1060
01:54:44,950 --> 01:54:48,460
Now beg for the blood!

1061
01:54:48,950 --> 01:54:50,450
Just give me the blood, Eli.
Let me get out of here.

1062
01:54:50,450 --> 01:54:53,450
Give me the blood, Lord,
and let me get away!

1063
01:54:53,450 --> 01:54:57,460
Do you accept Jesus Christ
as your Lord and Savior?

1064
01:54:57,460 --> 01:55:00,430
Yes, I do.
Get out of here, devil!

1065
01:55:00,430 --> 01:55:03,050
Out, devil! Out, sin!

1066
01:55:03,550 --> 01:55:06,050
Let me feel the power
of the Lord, Eli.
           Do you accept

1067
01:55:06,050 --> 01:55:10,050
the Church of
the Third Revelation
as your spiritual guide?

1068
01:55:11,560 --> 01:55:15,570
Get out of here, ghost!
    Where is your Lord, Eli?

1069
01:55:15,560 --> 01:55:19,560
Get out! Go back
where you belong!
 Where is he? There he is!

1070
01:55:20,030 --> 01:55:23,530
Do you accept
Jesus Christ
as your Savior?

1071
01:55:23,530 --> 01:55:25,030
Yes, I do.

Welcome to the fold,
brother Plainview.

1081
01:56:14,370 --> 01:56:16,870
Welcome,
brother Daniel. God bless you.

1082
01:56:17,870 --> 01:56:19,200
God bless you.

1083
01:56:22,710 --> 01:56:24,710
- Hallelujah.
- Amen.

1084
01:56:24,710 --> 01:56:27,210
Welcome home,
brother.

1085
01:56:27,210 --> 01:56:30,720
That's enough.
 That's enough, now.

1086
01:56:33,020 --> 01:56:37,020
He must take the spirit
in on his own.

1087
01:56:40,030 --> 01:56:42,030
We have a new member.

1088
01:56:42,030 --> 01:56:44,030
Yes, brother.
Hallelujah.

1089
01:56:44,030 --> 01:56:46,030
- Hallelujah.
- Amen.

1090
01:56:48,030 --> 01:56:50,540
My sweet Mary.
Mr. Plainview
has been generous

1091
01:56:50,540 --> 01:56:53,040
enough to make
a $5,000 donation

1092
01:56:53,540 --> 01:56:56,540
to the church
which we are
still waiting for.

1093
01:58:08,650 --> 01:58:11,650
Oh, that does me good.
That does me good.

1094
01:58:14,150 --> 01:58:15,650
Welcome home, son.

1095
01:58:18,160 --> 01:58:20,160
Welcome home, son.

1096
01:58:24,660 --> 01:58:26,160
This here's
George Reynolds.
Teacher from the deaf school.

1097
01:58:26,670 --> 01:58:29,670
- Mr. Plainview.
- Fletcher.

1098
01:58:32,170 --> 01:58:34,170
You're
too heavy for me.

1099
01:58:37,180 --> 01:58:41,100
Do you
want to get something to eat?

1100
01:58:41,100 --> 01:58:45,600
That's the pipeline, see?
All the way to the sea.

1101
01:59:06,620 --> 01:59:08,120
Come here.

1102
01:59:15,130 --> 01:59:17,130
I love you, son.

1103
01:59:18,640 --> 01:59:21,150
Let's take
a look at you.

1104
01:59:23,140 --> 01:59:26,140
All right. That's it,
that's it. That's it.

1105
01:59:43,040 --> 01:59:44,540
Uh...

1106
01:59:50,050 --> 01:59:53,550
Let's get some
decent food
inside of you.

1107
01:59:53,550 --> 01:59:57,390
That's all we need here
is a good, strong,
expensive meal.

1108
01:59:57,890 --> 01:59:59,390
You hungry?

1109
02:00:00,390 --> 02:00:01,840
Waiter?
Yes, sir.

1110
02:00:01,850 --> 02:00:04,860
Two steaks, a whiskey,
and water for him.

1111
02:00:06,350 --> 02:00:08,850
And goat's milk.
          Very good, sir.

1112
02:00:15,860 --> 02:00:19,360
We're going to have
this teacher help you.

1113
02:00:19,360 --> 02:00:23,870
He's going to help take care
of all of this. Understand?

1114
02:00:23,870 --> 02:00:26,700
'Cause I need you.
Need your help.

1115
02:00:26,700 --> 02:00:30,670
Got everything we need now
to build this company.
Come here.

1116
02:00:38,470 --> 02:00:40,360
Good afternoon.

1117
02:00:56,480 --> 02:00:58,480
How are you doing?
  It's nice to see
  you again.

1118
02:00:58,490 --> 02:01:01,500
We need four.
I'll have them
right up.

1119
02:01:05,580 --> 02:01:07,090
Good afternoon, Daniel.
      Oh, Tilford.

1120
02:01:07,580 --> 02:01:08,580
Good afternoon.

1121
02:01:10,580 --> 02:01:13,500
Hello! H.M. Tilford!

1122
02:01:13,500 --> 02:01:16,000
You don't have to shout.

1123
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:19,500
Pleasure.

1124
02:01:23,980 --> 02:01:27,480
Ah,
it's good to be
in Little B.

1125
02:01:27,480 --> 02:01:31,650
Could use some
        rain out here.
Yeah, we could.

1126
02:01:31,650 --> 02:01:34,900
There we go.
 R.J., how's
 the London broil?

1127
02:01:34,900 --> 02:01:37,410
Believe we ordered
these drinks before
those people.

1128
02:01:37,910 --> 02:01:39,910
R.J., tell us.
How's the London broil?

1129
02:01:39,910 --> 02:01:41,940
Excuse me,
gentlemen. Sorry.

1130
02:01:43,950 --> 02:01:47,920
I am sorry about
that, sir. I'll have
your steaks right out.

1131
02:01:57,930 --> 02:02:00,430
So that green
    turtle soup is fantastic.
Is it?

1132
02:02:00,430 --> 02:02:02,430
It's delicious.

1133
02:02:07,440 --> 02:02:08,440
Sounds good to me.

1134
02:02:09,940 --> 02:02:13,940
So Standard offered us
a million dollars for
the Little Boston leases.

1135
02:02:13,940 --> 02:02:16,950
I told H.M. Tilford
where he could shove that.

1136
02:02:16,950 --> 02:02:19,450
And we made a deal
with Union!

1137
02:02:19,450 --> 02:02:21,950
On the pipeline!

1138
02:02:21,950 --> 02:02:25,450
And that whole ocean of oil
underneath our fields.

1139
02:02:25,460 --> 02:02:27,000
...$150,000.
                     Yes.

1140
02:02:26,990 --> 02:02:29,490
We needed
the money to drill.

1141
02:02:29,490 --> 02:02:31,990
- Who is this guy?
-        I go out       to meet him.

1142
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:33,510
He's getting oil
on the property.

1143
02:02:33,500 --> 02:02:34,800
We're trying to
make a claim on it.

1144
02:02:34,800 --> 02:02:36,800
Offered him
a million dollars.

1145
02:02:36,800 --> 02:02:40,300
Turned us down flat.
Well, I'm hungry.

1146
02:02:40,300 --> 02:02:44,810
Orange fritters,
mashed potatoes, green peas.

1147
02:02:44,810 --> 02:02:47,310
All the way around?
All right.

1148
02:02:50,310 --> 02:02:51,810
Hold on.

1149
02:02:55,320 --> 02:02:57,820
I want you to
look over there.

1150
02:02:57,820 --> 02:03:00,820
Daniel, let me introduce...
Look over there. You see?

1151
02:03:00,820 --> 02:03:02,820
That's my son.
See him?

1152
02:03:02,830 --> 02:03:05,340
Yes.
Do you see?

1153
02:03:07,830 --> 02:03:09,830
I see him.

1154
02:03:09,830 --> 02:03:12,830
You don't tell me
how to raise my family.

1155
02:03:14,840 --> 02:03:18,340
I told you not to tell me
how to raise my family.

1156
02:03:19,840 --> 02:03:21,840
Daniel...

1157
02:03:22,850 --> 02:03:24,720
So what do you see?

1158
02:03:26,720 --> 02:03:29,730
I'm very happy for
          you that the deal...
Yes, I made a deal with Union.

1159
02:03:29,720 --> 02:03:32,220
My son is happy.
He's safe.
             Congratulations.

1160
02:03:32,220 --> 02:03:35,720
I'm taking care
of him now, so...
                   Excellent.

1161
02:03:36,730 --> 02:03:39,740
You look like a fool,
don't you, Tilford?

1162
02:03:44,230 --> 02:03:45,730
Yes.

1163
02:03:45,740 --> 02:03:47,250
Yes.

1164
02:03:49,240 --> 02:03:50,740
Yes, you do.

1165
02:03:51,740 --> 02:03:53,240
Excuse me,
gentlemen.

1166
02:03:53,240 --> 02:03:56,240
Oh, excuse me, gentlemen.
Excuse him, gentlemen.

1167
02:04:00,250 --> 02:04:02,750
I told you what
I was going to do.

1168
02:04:13,310 --> 02:04:14,310
My son.

1169
02:04:32,330 --> 02:04:35,870
Mr. Sunday, I understand
that you're leaving
our fair community.

1170
02:04:35,870 --> 02:04:37,370
Yes, I'm going
on a mission.

1171
02:04:37,370 --> 02:04:38,870
Where you going?

1172
02:04:39,370 --> 02:04:41,590
Oildale, Taft,
and then on to
Bakersfield.

1173
02:04:41,590 --> 02:04:44,090
Well, I want you to know...

1174
02:04:44,090 --> 02:04:46,090
Three quarters
of an hour.

1175
02:04:46,100 --> 02:04:47,610
...you done
a great job for us.

1176
02:04:47,600 --> 02:04:49,100
Thank you.
You will be in
my prayers.

1177
02:04:49,100 --> 02:04:50,350
I thank you very much.

1178
02:04:50,680 --> 02:04:53,690
Union Oil Company,
Santa Paula, California.

1179
02:07:02,730 --> 02:07:06,730
"The woman saith unto him,
'Sir, give me this water

1180
02:07:08,240 --> 02:07:12,520
"'and I shall thirst not,
neither come hither to draw.'"

1181
02:08:54,010 --> 02:08:55,510
Come in, come in.

1182
02:09:22,570 --> 02:09:25,070
Can we be alone?

1183
02:09:25,070 --> 02:09:28,580
This is my closest associate.
He hears everything.

1184
02:09:35,640 --> 02:09:38,060
I'd prefer
to speak to you in private.

1185
02:09:38,050 --> 02:09:40,560
You can't speak.

1186
02:09:41,060 --> 02:09:43,060
So why don't you
flap your hands about

1187
02:09:43,060 --> 02:09:46,890
and have what's-his-name
tell me where you've been.

1188
02:09:54,570 --> 02:09:57,410
Or do you think
I don't know?

1189
02:10:12,170 --> 02:10:15,170
This is hard
for me to say.

1190
02:10:15,170 --> 02:10:19,680
I'll tell you first,
I love you very much.

1191
02:10:22,800 --> 02:10:26,800
I've learned to
love what I do
because of you.

1192
02:10:30,310 --> 02:10:31,820
I'm leaving here.

1193
02:10:33,360 --> 02:10:35,860
I'm going to Mexico.

1194
02:10:35,860 --> 02:10:38,860
I'm taking Mary,
and I'm going to Mexico.

1195
02:10:40,780 --> 02:10:42,780
I miss working outside.

1196
02:10:43,790 --> 02:10:45,800
I miss the fields.

1197
02:10:48,290 --> 02:10:50,790
It'll only be for a time,

1198
02:10:51,790 --> 02:10:54,300
for me to do
my own drilling

1199
02:10:55,800 --> 02:10:58,300
and start my own company.

1200
02:11:00,800 --> 02:11:04,810
It's time to
make a change.

1201
02:11:18,770 --> 02:11:20,910
This makes you
my competitor.

1202
02:11:25,240 --> 02:11:27,360
No. No,
it's not like that.

1203
02:11:27,360 --> 02:11:29,700
It is like that, boy.

1204
02:11:31,580 --> 02:11:33,580
Your own company, huh?

1205
02:11:33,590 --> 02:11:35,100
That's right.

1206
02:11:37,590 --> 02:11:39,420
In Mexico?

1207
02:11:40,790 --> 02:11:42,340
Yes.

1208
02:11:42,340 --> 02:11:47,350
You are making
such a misstep.
So, what are you doing?

1209
02:11:48,880 --> 02:11:53,390
I know you and I
have disagreed
over many things.

1210
02:11:53,390 --> 02:11:57,890
I'd rather keep
you as my father
than my partner.

1211
02:11:57,890 --> 02:11:59,310
Then say it.

1212
02:11:59,310 --> 02:12:01,310
If you've got something
to say to me, then say it.

1213
02:12:01,310 --> 02:12:03,810
I'd like to hear you speak
instead of your little dog.

1214
02:12:23,220 --> 02:12:25,720
I'm going to
Mexico with my wife.

1215
02:12:26,720 --> 02:12:28,720
I'm going away from you.

1216
02:12:34,850 --> 02:12:37,350
That wasn't so hard, was it?

1217
02:12:39,350 --> 02:12:42,350
Killing us with
what you're doing.

1218
02:12:44,860 --> 02:12:48,410
You're killing my image
of you as my son.

1219
02:12:48,410 --> 02:12:51,950
You are stubborn.
You won't listen.

1220
02:12:51,950 --> 02:12:54,370
You're not my son.

1221
02:12:54,370 --> 02:12:57,750
Please don't say that.
I know you don't mean it.

1222
02:12:57,750 --> 02:13:01,760
It's the truth.
You're not my son.
You never have been.

1223
02:13:03,260 --> 02:13:04,760
You're an orphan!

1224
02:13:07,880 --> 02:13:09,880
Did you ever
hear that word?

1225
02:13:11,630 --> 02:13:13,800
Tell him what I said.

1226
02:13:14,300 --> 02:13:17,300
You operated here
today like one.

1227
02:13:18,810 --> 02:13:21,060
I should have seen
this coming.

1228
02:13:22,390 --> 02:13:27,620
I should have known that,
under this all,
these past years

1229
02:13:27,620 --> 02:13:31,120
you've been building
new hate for me,
piece by piece.

1230
02:13:31,120 --> 02:13:34,620
I don't even know
who you are because
you have none of me in you.

1231
02:13:34,620 --> 02:13:37,630
You're someone else's.

1232
02:13:39,160 --> 02:13:42,660
This anger.
Your maliciousness.

1233
02:13:43,500 --> 02:13:46,500
Backwards dealings with me.

1234
02:13:48,500 --> 02:13:52,510
You're an orphan
from a basket in
the middle of the desert.

1235
02:13:54,980 --> 02:13:56,980
And I took you for
no other reason

1236
02:13:56,980 --> 02:13:59,480
than I needed
a sweet face to buy land.

1237
02:14:01,320 --> 02:14:03,320
Did you get that?

1238
02:14:04,320 --> 02:14:06,320
So now you know.

1239
02:14:09,660 --> 02:14:14,110
Look at me!
You're lower
than a bastard.

1240
02:14:33,930 --> 02:14:35,470
Mmm-hmm.

1241
02:14:38,970 --> 02:14:43,470
You have none of me in you.
You're just a bastard
from a basket.

1242
02:14:53,040 --> 02:14:57,550
I thank God
I have none of you in me.

1243
02:15:02,380 --> 02:15:06,880
Not my son.
Just a little piece
of competition.

1244
02:15:08,380 --> 02:15:10,890
Bastard from a basket.

1245
02:15:12,890 --> 02:15:15,390
Bastard from a basket!

1246
02:15:23,400 --> 02:15:26,350
You're a bastard
from a basket!

1247
02:16:28,580 --> 02:16:30,580
<i>Get up, Mr. Daniel.</i>

1248
02:16:35,090 --> 02:16:36,590
<i>Mr. Daniel.</i>

1249
02:16:38,640 --> 02:16:41,140
Mr. Daniel,
you've got a visitor.

1250
02:16:44,650 --> 02:16:46,650
Wake up, Mr. Daniel.

1251
02:16:49,150 --> 02:16:50,650
Sir?

1252
02:17:04,170 --> 02:17:06,180
You can leave us now.

1253
02:17:14,680 --> 02:17:15,680
Daniel.

1254
02:17:19,180 --> 02:17:20,180
Daniel.

1255
02:17:22,600 --> 02:17:26,100
Daniel Plainview,
the house is on fire!

1256
02:17:30,610 --> 02:17:33,610
Brother Daniel,
it's Eli.

1257
02:17:43,620 --> 02:17:47,630
Yes, it is.
Yes, it is.

1258
02:17:49,630 --> 02:17:51,630
I'll make us a drink.

1259
02:17:57,640 --> 02:18:01,140
Oh, your home is a miracle.

1260
02:18:02,640 --> 02:18:04,010
It's beautiful.

1261
02:18:05,010 --> 02:18:07,010
God bless it.

1262
02:18:07,010 --> 02:18:11,020
I've been spreading
His word far and wide.

1263
02:18:12,520 --> 02:18:14,320
Far and wide.

1264
02:18:15,740 --> 02:18:18,740
So much travel for Him.

1265
02:18:23,330 --> 02:18:25,830
I've been working in radio.

1266
02:18:28,500 --> 02:18:33,500
Yes, so much...
So much has been happening.

1267
02:18:33,510 --> 02:18:39,190
To be here and find you
and see you well is wonderful.

1268
02:18:39,180 --> 02:18:41,680
And we have
a chance to catch up.

1269
02:18:54,730 --> 02:18:56,730
No. Thank you so much.

1270
02:19:09,790 --> 02:19:11,290
Oh.

1271
02:19:14,800 --> 02:19:16,800
My brother.

1272
02:19:17,800 --> 02:19:21,300
Daniel, my brother
by marriage.

1273
02:19:23,220 --> 02:19:27,220
We're such old friends.
So much time.

1274
02:19:33,930 --> 02:19:36,930
Things go up,
things go down,

1275
02:19:36,940 --> 02:19:41,450
but at least
the Lord is always around.

1276
02:19:42,770 --> 02:19:45,780
We've seen ups and downs,
haven't we?

1277
02:19:49,360 --> 02:19:52,620
Are things down
for you right now, Eli?

1278
02:19:53,620 --> 02:19:55,120
No. No.

1279
02:19:57,620 --> 02:20:00,120
But I do come
with some sad news.

1280
02:20:02,130 --> 02:20:04,630
Perhaps you remember
Mr. Bandy?

1281
02:20:07,130 --> 02:20:11,390
Mr. Bandy has
passed on to the Lord.

1282
02:20:11,390 --> 02:20:15,390
He lived to be 99 years old,
God bless him.

1283
02:20:15,390 --> 02:20:17,390
Mr. Bandy has a grandson.

1284
02:20:17,390 --> 02:20:20,390
Have you met
his grandson,
William?

1285
02:20:20,400 --> 02:20:24,910
William Bandy is one of
the finest members we have

1286
02:20:24,900 --> 02:20:27,900
at the Church of
the Third Revelation.

1287
02:20:27,900 --> 02:20:30,990
He's eager to
come to Hollywood
to be in movies.

1288
02:20:32,490 --> 02:20:34,490
He is very good-looking.

1289
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:40,010
And I do think
he will have success.

1290
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:42,500
That's wonderful.

1291
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:47,050
Would you like me
to speak with him?

1292
02:20:53,980 --> 02:20:58,980
Daniel, I'm asking
if you'd like
to have business

1293
02:20:58,980 --> 02:21:01,490
with the Church of
the Third Revelation

1294
02:21:01,490 --> 02:21:05,490
in developing this lease
on young Bandy's
1,000-acre tract.

1295
02:21:07,990 --> 02:21:09,990
I'm offering you to drill

1296
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:13,510
on one of the great
undeveloped fields
of Little Boston.

1297
02:21:13,500 --> 02:21:16,000
I'd be happy to
work with you.

1298
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:18,000
You would?

1299
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:22,010
Yes, yes, of course.
That's wonderful.

1300
02:21:22,010 --> 02:21:25,010
But there is
one condition
for this work.

1301
02:21:25,010 --> 02:21:26,510
All right.

1302
02:21:28,510 --> 02:21:32,430
I'd like you to tell me
that you are a false prophet.

1303
02:21:37,560 --> 02:21:40,570
I'd like you to
tell me that you are,

1304
02:21:40,560 --> 02:21:44,060
and have been
a false prophet.

1305
02:21:44,060 --> 02:21:46,560
And that God is
a superstition.

1306
02:21:52,570 --> 02:21:54,820
But that's a lie.

1307
02:21:57,130 --> 02:22:00,140
It's a lie.
I cannot say it.

1308
02:22:14,260 --> 02:22:16,760
When can we begin to drill?
                  Very soon.

1309
02:22:16,760 --> 02:22:18,260
How long will it take
to bring in the well?

1310
02:22:18,260 --> 02:22:20,260
It shouldn't take long.

1311
02:22:20,270 --> 02:22:23,780
I would like
a $100,000
signing bonus,

1312
02:22:23,770 --> 02:22:27,270
plus the five
that is owed to me
with interest.

1313
02:22:27,770 --> 02:22:29,570
That's only fair.

1314
02:22:35,450 --> 02:22:39,950
I am a false prophet,
and God is a superstition.

1315
02:22:40,450 --> 02:22:43,370
If that's what you believe,
then I will say it.

1316
02:22:43,370 --> 02:22:45,370
Say it like you mean it.

1317
02:22:45,370 --> 02:22:47,370
Daniel.

1318
02:22:47,380 --> 02:22:49,720
Say it like
it's your sermon.

1319
02:22:52,630 --> 02:22:54,630
Don't smile.

1320
02:23:00,140 --> 02:23:02,140
I am a false prophet.

1321
02:23:02,140 --> 02:23:05,640
God is a superstition.
    Why don't you stand up?

1322
02:23:08,650 --> 02:23:10,650
Put your glass down.

1323
02:23:22,660 --> 02:23:26,660
I am a false prophet.

1324
02:23:26,670 --> 02:23:29,480
God is a superstition.
             Eli, stop.

1325
02:23:29,970 --> 02:23:32,970
Just imagine this
is your church here

1326
02:23:32,970 --> 02:23:35,470
and you have a full
congregation, so...

1327
02:23:37,480 --> 02:23:41,490
I am a false prophet.
God is a superstition.

1328
02:23:41,480 --> 02:23:44,310
Say it again.

1329
02:23:44,320 --> 02:23:48,330
I am a false prophet.
God is a superstition.

1330
02:23:48,320 --> 02:23:49,320
They can't hear you
at the back.

1331
02:23:49,320 --> 02:23:52,820
I am a false prophet.
God is a superstition.

1332
02:23:52,820 --> 02:23:54,320
Say it again.

1333
02:23:54,330 --> 02:23:58,840
I am a false prophet!
God is a superstition!

1334
02:23:58,830 --> 02:24:00,830
Say it again.

1335
02:24:00,830 --> 02:24:04,420
I am a false prophet!
God is a superstition!

1336
02:24:05,420 --> 02:24:07,920
Those areas
have been drilled.

1337
02:24:11,040 --> 02:24:12,540
What?

1338
02:24:12,540 --> 02:24:15,050
Those areas,
they've been drilled.

1339
02:24:16,550 --> 02:24:18,050
No, they haven't.

1340
02:24:18,050 --> 02:24:20,550
Yes, it's...

1341
02:24:20,550 --> 02:24:22,140
It's called drainage, Eli.

1342
02:24:22,140 --> 02:24:26,640
See, I own everything
around it, so, of course,
I get what's underneath it.

1343
02:24:28,140 --> 02:24:31,650
But there are no
derricks there.

1344
02:24:31,650 --> 02:24:34,150
This is the Bandy tract.
Do you understand?

1345
02:24:34,150 --> 02:24:36,650
Do you understand, Eli?

1346
02:24:36,650 --> 02:24:40,150
That's more to the point.
Do you understand?

1347
02:24:40,160 --> 02:24:46,170
I drink your water.
I drink it up every day.

1348
02:24:46,660 --> 02:24:50,660
I drink the blood of Lamb
from Bandy's tract.

1349
02:24:56,050 --> 02:24:58,220
You can sit down again.

1350
02:25:16,240 --> 02:25:17,740
Oh, Daniel.

1351
02:25:20,750 --> 02:25:21,760
Daniel.

1352
02:25:25,750 --> 02:25:27,250
Please.

1353
02:25:29,750 --> 02:25:32,260
I am in desperate times.

1354
02:25:32,260 --> 02:25:33,760
I know.

1355
02:25:34,260 --> 02:25:37,260
I need a friend.
  Yes. Of course, you do.

1356
02:25:37,260 --> 02:25:38,760
I've sinned.

1357
02:25:40,770 --> 02:25:43,780
I need help.
I'm a sinner.

1358
02:25:43,770 --> 02:25:48,770
I've let
the devil grab hold of me
in ways I never imagined.

1359
02:25:48,770 --> 02:25:50,020
I'm so full of sin.

1360
02:25:50,030 --> 02:25:53,540
The Lord sometimes
challenges us,
doesn't He, Eli?

1361
02:25:53,530 --> 02:25:55,530
Oh, yes, He does, Daniel.
             Yes, He does.

1362
02:25:55,530 --> 02:25:58,530
Yes, He does!

1363
02:25:58,530 --> 02:26:01,540
Yes, He does!

1364
02:26:01,540 --> 02:26:06,990
He's completely failed
to alert me to the recent
panic in our economy.

1365
02:26:07,490 --> 02:26:09,490
And this...
            Oh, dear.

1366
02:26:09,490 --> 02:26:16,500
I must have this, Daniel.
I must, I must,
I must have this.

1367
02:26:16,500 --> 02:26:18,500
My investments have...

1368
02:26:18,500 --> 02:26:24,010
Daniel, I won't bore you,
but if I could grab the
Lord's hand for help I would,

1369
02:26:24,010 --> 02:26:27,010
but He does these
things all the time.

1370
02:26:27,010 --> 02:26:31,010
These mysteries
that He presents,
and while we wait...

1371
02:26:32,020 --> 02:26:34,520
While we wait
for His word!

1372
02:26:34,520 --> 02:26:37,320
Because you're not
the chosen brother, Eli.

1373
02:26:39,820 --> 02:26:43,830
'Twas Paul
who was chosen.

1374
02:26:44,330 --> 02:26:47,330
He found me and told me
about your land.
You're just a fool.

1375
02:26:47,330 --> 02:26:48,830
Why are you
talking about Paul?

1376
02:26:48,830 --> 02:26:50,330
I did what your
brother couldn't.

1377
02:26:50,340 --> 02:26:52,850
Don't say this to me.
              I broke you
              and I beat you.

1378
02:26:53,840 --> 02:26:56,840
It was Paul
told me about you.

1379
02:26:56,840 --> 02:27:01,340
He's the prophet.
He's the smart one.
He knew what was there

1380
02:27:01,350 --> 02:27:03,860
and he found me
to take it out
of the ground.

1381
02:27:03,850 --> 02:27:07,850
Know what
the funny thing is?
Listen, listen.

1382
02:27:07,850 --> 02:27:12,860
I paid him $10,000
cash in hand.
Just like that.

1383
02:27:12,860 --> 02:27:16,360
He has his own company now.
Prosperous little business.

1384
02:27:16,360 --> 02:27:18,360
Three wells producing,
$5,000 a week.

1385
02:27:21,870 --> 02:27:25,870
Stop crying,
you sniveling ass.
Stop your nonsense.

1386
02:27:26,870 --> 02:27:29,870
You're just
the afterbirth, Eli.

1387
02:27:29,870 --> 02:27:30,870
No.

1388
02:27:30,880 --> 02:27:33,390
That slithered out
on your mother's filth.

1389
02:27:33,380 --> 02:27:34,880
No.

1390
02:27:34,880 --> 02:27:39,300
They should've put
you in a glass jar
on the mantelpiece.

1391
02:27:40,800 --> 02:27:44,300
Where were you
when Paul was suckling
at his mother's teat?

1392
02:27:44,310 --> 02:27:45,820
Where were you?

1393
02:27:46,310 --> 02:27:48,310
Who was nursing you,
poor Eli?

1394
02:27:48,810 --> 02:27:50,810
One of Bandy's sows?

1395
02:27:50,810 --> 02:27:53,810
That land has been had.
Nothing you can
do about it. It's gone.

1396
02:27:53,820 --> 02:27:56,330
If you would just
take this lease...
                    You lose.

1397
02:27:56,320 --> 02:27:59,320
Drainage!

1398
02:28:00,320 --> 02:28:04,320
Drainage, Eli, you boy.

1399
02:28:05,330 --> 02:28:08,330
Drained dry.
I'm so sorry.

1400
02:28:09,330 --> 02:28:11,330
If you have a milkshake

1401
02:28:12,330 --> 02:28:14,330
and I have a milkshake,

1402
02:28:14,340 --> 02:28:15,850
and I have a straw,
there it is.

1403
02:28:15,840 --> 02:28:17,840
That's the straw,
you see?

1404
02:28:17,840 --> 02:28:19,340
Watch it.

1405
02:28:20,840 --> 02:28:27,600
Now my straw
reaches across the room

1406
02:28:29,100 --> 02:28:31,600
and starts to
drink your milkshake.

1407
02:28:32,600 --> 02:28:36,610
I drink your milkshake!

1408
02:28:38,610 --> 02:28:40,110
I drink it up!

1409
02:28:40,110 --> 02:28:42,030
Don't bully me, Daniel.

1410
02:28:44,650 --> 02:28:47,150
Did you think
your song and dance

1411
02:28:47,150 --> 02:28:49,950
and your superstition
would help you, Eli?

1412
02:28:49,950 --> 02:28:55,160
I am the Third Revelation.
I am who the Lord has chosen.

1413
02:28:57,160 --> 02:28:59,410
Daniel!
Because I'm smarter
than you!

1414
02:28:59,410 --> 02:29:01,830
I'm older!

1415
02:29:01,830 --> 02:29:03,830
I'm your old friend,
Daniel!

1416
02:29:03,840 --> 02:29:05,930
I'm not a false prophet...
            Help me! Help me!

1417
02:29:06,420 --> 02:29:08,590
...you sniveling boy!

1418
02:29:08,590 --> 02:29:12,090
I am the Third Revelation!

1419
02:29:12,090 --> 02:29:15,260
I am the Third Revelation!

1420
02:29:15,260 --> 02:29:18,260
I told you
     I would eat you.
We're family!

1421
02:29:18,270 --> 02:29:20,780
I told you
I would eat you up!

1422
02:29:20,770 --> 02:29:23,270
We're brothers!
We're brothers!

1423
02:29:29,780 --> 02:29:32,780
Daniel, please forgive me.
I beg you.

1424
02:29:36,420 --> 02:29:38,700
That's it. That's it.

1425
02:30:41,100 --> 02:30:42,350
Mr. Daniel?

1426
02:30:50,160 --> 02:30:52,160
I'm finished.
