1
00:01:32,326 --> 00:01:32,891
Hiya, Stel.

2
00:01:32,993 --> 00:01:33,926
Hello.

3
00:01:38,666 --> 00:01:39,431
Hello, Stella.

4
00:01:39,533 --> 00:01:40,265
Hello.

5
00:02:04,058 --> 00:02:07,092
Stella's got a fella!

6
00:02:07,194 --> 00:02:08,660
Only
he don't know it.

7
00:02:08,762 --> 00:02:09,628
Who?

8
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,330
You, that's who.

9
00:02:11,432 --> 00:02:13,365
My own sister, standing
out here every night making

10
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:15,267
a sap out of herself over a
guy who don't even know she's

11
00:02:15,369 --> 00:02:17,202
on Earth.
- You mind your own business!

12
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:19,104
Anyways, you don't know
what you're talking about.

13
00:02:19,206 --> 00:02:20,405
Oh, I don't, huh?

14
00:02:20,508 --> 00:02:21,840
I suppose you doll
up every night

15
00:02:21,942 --> 00:02:23,342
and wait out here
to welcome me home.

16
00:02:23,444 --> 00:02:25,110
Why, of course.

17
00:02:25,212 --> 00:02:27,012
Oh, gee, thanks.

18
00:02:27,114 --> 00:02:28,380
I must give you a
kiss for that one.

19
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:29,214
Now stop it!

20
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:30,549
Take your dirty hands off of me!

21
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:33,252
Ah, you're
just like all the rest.

22
00:02:33,354 --> 00:02:35,354
There's fingers nearly chopped
off at the mill every time

23
00:02:35,456 --> 00:02:36,922
he passes.

24
00:02:37,024 --> 00:02:38,590
But he don't look
at none of 'em.

25
00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:39,558
Why should he?

26
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,727
Mill hands.

27
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:44,963
Hey, wait a minute.

28
00:02:45,065 --> 00:02:47,199
There's some nice girls
that's mill hands.

29
00:02:47,301 --> 00:02:48,400
Where do you get off?

30
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:49,635
What's the matter
with a mill hand?

31
00:02:49,737 --> 00:02:51,036
I work in the mill.

32
00:02:51,138 --> 00:02:52,171
I'm a mill hand, and your
father's a mill hand!

33
00:02:52,273 --> 00:02:53,238
All right, all
right, don't yell.

34
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,506
The neighbors know it.
- Yeah?

35
00:02:54,608 --> 00:02:55,574
Well, maybe he don't,
so I'll tell him!

36
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:56,408
Hey!
- Stop that!

37
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,610
Here, stop this!

38
00:02:58,712 --> 00:02:59,745
What's the matter with you two?

39
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:01,280
You used to get along.

40
00:03:01,382 --> 00:03:03,815
Yeah, but that was before
she started taking a business

41
00:03:03,918 --> 00:03:05,984
course to improve herself.

42
00:03:06,086 --> 00:03:08,253
It's done her a lot
of good, all right.

43
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:10,789
She ain't satisfied
with none of us anymore.

44
00:03:10,891 --> 00:03:11,690
Supper!

45
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:12,691
What'd you say, Mom?

46
00:03:12,793 --> 00:03:13,725
Supper's ready!

47
00:03:13,827 --> 00:03:15,060
Yeah, so am I. Come on, Pop.

48
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:19,731
Come on, Stel.

49
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:20,632
I'll be in in a minute.

50
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:46,124
The childhood sweetheart
of young Stephen Dallas,

51
00:03:46,227 --> 00:03:48,227
a sweetheart until
that tragic hour

52
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:50,963
when his millionaire father,
bankrupt and ill, committed

53
00:03:51,065 --> 00:03:52,564
suicide.

54
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:55,767
Two days later Stephen Dallas
disappeared, leaving behind him

55
00:03:55,869 --> 00:03:59,671
a note saying that he was trying
to make a life somewhere else.

56
00:04:04,311 --> 00:04:06,878
Harvard graduate and crewman
disappeared immediately

57
00:04:06,981 --> 00:04:08,213
after his father's death.

58
00:04:08,315 --> 00:04:10,415
Millionaire playboy
left without a penny.

59
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:29,101
Don't be late, Charlie.

60
00:04:33,741 --> 00:04:34,606
What is it?

61
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:35,674
Your lunch.

62
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:37,075
Oh, that's
right, get funny.

63
00:04:37,177 --> 00:04:38,310
You know what I mean.
What's in it?

64
00:04:38,412 --> 00:04:39,945
Oh, just a little
turkey and dressing.

65
00:04:40,047 --> 00:04:40,979
That's all I had today.

66
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:43,882
Wait a minute.

67
00:04:43,984 --> 00:04:45,784
Baloney again.

68
00:04:45,886 --> 00:04:47,085
And apple butter.

69
00:04:47,187 --> 00:04:49,288
Baloney and apple
butter, apple butter

70
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:51,356
and baloney, that's all I get.

71
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:52,791
Well, I ain't going
to take it no more.

72
00:04:52,893 --> 00:04:54,693
It's all right with me,
you can do without it.

73
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:55,827
Oh, I can, huh?

74
00:04:55,929 --> 00:04:56,795
Charlie, I'll
fix you something.

75
00:04:56,897 --> 00:04:58,130
Oh, don't baby him, Mom.

76
00:04:58,232 --> 00:04:59,364
Baby me?

77
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:00,866
I'm old enough to
earn money, ain't I?

78
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:03,001
A man could have a home of
his own on what I'm making!

79
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:06,071
Charlie, wait a minute.

80
00:05:06,173 --> 00:05:09,841
Oh, what do you want to
egg him on for, Stella?

81
00:05:09,943 --> 00:05:12,210
You know that Jenkins girl's
just dying to get him.

82
00:05:12,313 --> 00:05:13,412
Well, let her, then.

83
00:05:13,514 --> 00:05:15,080
If that's the only
ambition he's got,

84
00:05:15,182 --> 00:05:16,481
there's nothing you
can do about it.

85
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:19,384
I don't know what
we'd do without him.

86
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:20,752
I'm going to fix up
something for him to eat

87
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:23,221
and you can leave it for
him on your way down.

88
00:05:23,324 --> 00:05:25,824
He'll starve first.

89
00:05:36,403 --> 00:05:38,737
Maybe you're right, Mom.

90
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:41,506
I'll take it down to him.

91
00:05:41,608 --> 00:05:43,008
I'll run over to
the delicatessen

92
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:44,309
after and get him
something nice.

93
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:45,610
Will you?

94
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,718
Yeah.

95
00:06:27,121 --> 00:06:28,887
Hey, the boss just phoned.

96
00:06:28,989 --> 00:06:29,855
He's in Millhampton Junction.

97
00:06:29,957 --> 00:06:31,323
He just got in.

98
00:06:31,425 --> 00:06:32,991
He said to tell you the
contract with Parker Company's

99
00:06:33,093 --> 00:06:34,259
right in his vest pocket.

100
00:06:34,361 --> 00:06:35,594
He's chirping over
the phone like a bird.

101
00:06:35,696 --> 00:06:36,995
He says he'll be
here in a few minutes

102
00:06:37,097 --> 00:06:40,198
but just wanted to tell you.

103
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,834
Hey, ain't you interested?

104
00:06:42,936 --> 00:06:44,069
Yes, yes, I'm--

105
00:06:44,171 --> 00:06:45,737
I'm glad Mr. Beamer
got the contract.

106
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:46,905
Well, you ought to be.

107
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:48,440
He was chirping like a bird.

108
00:06:48,542 --> 00:06:50,642
Like a bird, you know the
way he does on the telephone.

109
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:52,778
Yes, sir, he said to put you
down for a raise this week.

110
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,313
And you could have
that vacation now.

111
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:56,348
How's that?

112
00:06:59,286 --> 00:07:01,219
I don't need a vacation now.

113
00:07:01,321 --> 00:07:03,121
I've no place to go.

114
00:07:03,223 --> 00:07:03,989
Huh?

115
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:04,823
Oh, oh, nothing.

116
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:06,625
Nothing.

117
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:03,348
I beg your pardon.

118
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:05,750
Could you tell me where I
could find Charlie Martin?

119
00:08:05,853 --> 00:08:06,785
Charlie Martin?

120
00:08:06,887 --> 00:08:08,587
Yes, he works on
the carding machine.

121
00:08:08,689 --> 00:08:09,588
Oh, yes.

122
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:10,856
The-- the carding machines.

123
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:13,825
Well, why, they're
closed down just now.

124
00:08:13,927 --> 00:08:16,328
He'd be out in the
yard most likely.

125
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,929
I'll tell you what you do.

126
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:19,331
You go right back through the
corridor the way you came in,

127
00:08:19,433 --> 00:08:23,301
and instead of coming
up those stairs,

128
00:08:23,403 --> 00:08:24,970
there's a big gate down there.

129
00:08:25,072 --> 00:08:28,006
And if you go right through
that gate, and the path

130
00:08:28,108 --> 00:08:30,842
leads right down past
that first big building.

131
00:08:30,944 --> 00:08:32,410
And just as you turn
around the corner,

132
00:08:32,513 --> 00:08:34,980
the men usually have their--

133
00:08:35,082 --> 00:08:37,249
Yes?

134
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:39,551
Well, er-- it's sort
of dirty down there.

135
00:08:39,653 --> 00:08:40,886
Maybe I'd better send for him.

136
00:08:44,658 --> 00:08:45,957
Won't you sit down?

137
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:48,727
Thank you.

138
00:08:48,829 --> 00:08:49,761
McCarthy!

139
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:50,729
Yes, sir.

140
00:08:50,831 --> 00:08:52,030
Find Charlie Martin
and send him in.

141
00:08:52,132 --> 00:08:52,864
Yes, sir.

142
00:08:52,966 --> 00:08:53,698
Right away.

143
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,372
He'll be right in.

144
00:09:00,474 --> 00:09:03,174
Thank you.

145
00:09:03,277 --> 00:09:04,576
Good morning,
Dallas, good morning.

146
00:09:04,678 --> 00:09:07,145
Mr. Beamer, congratulations
on that contract.

147
00:09:07,247 --> 00:09:08,313
How do you do, Mr. Beamer?

148
00:09:08,415 --> 00:09:10,815
How do you do?

149
00:09:10,918 --> 00:09:11,750
Stella Martin?

150
00:09:11,852 --> 00:09:13,318
Martin's girl?

151
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:16,922
You're all grown
up, and so pretty.

152
00:09:17,024 --> 00:09:17,923
Isn't she, Dallas?

153
00:09:18,025 --> 00:09:19,424
Yes.

154
00:09:19,526 --> 00:09:22,427
Say, how long have you
two known each other?

155
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:25,497
Well, we, ah,
haven't really met.

156
00:09:25,599 --> 00:09:26,998
Oh, excuse me.

157
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,466
Mr. Dallas, this is Miss Martin.

158
00:09:28,569 --> 00:09:29,401
Miss Martin, Mr. Dallas.

159
00:09:29,503 --> 00:09:30,235
How do you do?

160
00:09:30,337 --> 00:09:31,603
How do you do?

161
00:09:31,705 --> 00:09:33,071
My brother forgot
his lunch and I

162
00:09:33,173 --> 00:09:35,540
didn't want him to go without,
so I brought it to him.

163
00:09:35,642 --> 00:09:36,575
That's a nice girl.

164
00:09:36,677 --> 00:09:37,742
Good to your brother.

165
00:09:37,844 --> 00:09:39,277
Good to your father,
too, I'll bet.

166
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:42,314
I wish I had somebody thinking
so much of me, eh, Dallas?

167
00:09:44,518 --> 00:09:45,450
He ain't there, Mr. Dallas.

168
00:09:45,552 --> 00:09:46,451
They said he went out to eat.

169
00:09:46,553 --> 00:09:47,752
Oh, thank you.

170
00:09:47,854 --> 00:09:49,521
Oh, that's too bad,
after all your trouble.

171
00:09:49,623 --> 00:09:52,591
Oh, I suppose it was
all my fault. I was late.

172
00:09:52,693 --> 00:09:55,527
Well, it wouldn't do him
any harm to wait, would it?

173
00:09:55,629 --> 00:09:57,295
I'll bet sometimes he's late.

174
00:09:57,397 --> 00:09:59,397
Never mind, don't you worry.

175
00:09:59,499 --> 00:10:00,966
Let's see what you've got.

176
00:10:01,068 --> 00:10:03,234
Maybe we can make believe
that you brought it to us.

177
00:10:03,337 --> 00:10:04,269
Eh, Dallas?

178
00:10:04,371 --> 00:10:07,005
Well, it isn't anything much.

179
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:07,839
Oh!

180
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:13,645
Mm!

181
00:10:13,747 --> 00:10:14,679
Make this yourself?

182
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:15,347
Mm-hm.

183
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:16,281
Dallas?

184
00:10:16,383 --> 00:10:17,115
Thank you.

185
00:10:17,217 --> 00:10:18,283
You do.

186
00:10:18,385 --> 00:10:20,318
I hope they're not too dry.

187
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,953
I forgot to bring
anything to drink.

188
00:10:22,055 --> 00:10:23,021
I have some milk here.

189
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:24,155
Oh, fine.

190
00:10:24,257 --> 00:10:24,923
I'll
get some glasses.

191
00:10:25,025 --> 00:10:25,757
Can I help you?

192
00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:26,958
Thank you.

193
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:30,595
Say, you're some
cook, aren't you?

194
00:10:30,697 --> 00:10:31,830
Oh, wait, please.

195
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:40,205
I hate glasses that don't shine.

196
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:41,039
Don't you?

197
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:42,407
Mm.

198
00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:45,010
Mm-hm.

199
00:11:26,586 --> 00:11:29,854
Care to go?

200
00:11:31,491 --> 00:11:32,190
Mm-hm.

201
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:33,024
You ready?

202
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:37,195
Hello, Stella.

203
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:38,063
Hello.

204
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:42,934
Hello, Steve.

205
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:44,002
Hiya, Ned.

206
00:11:44,104 --> 00:11:45,203
Don't forget, the
missus will be expecting

207
00:11:45,305 --> 00:11:46,504
you over for that good meal.

208
00:11:46,606 --> 00:11:47,338
You bet.

209
00:11:47,441 --> 00:11:48,339
Very soon.

210
00:11:48,442 --> 00:11:50,041
You going there for dinner?

211
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:54,612
Gee, you who could
be at the River Club.

212
00:11:54,715 --> 00:11:55,814
Look, look.

213
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:57,982
Hmm, that's the
second time this week.

214
00:11:58,085 --> 00:12:00,218
I saw them in the drugstore
together the other night.

215
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,586
You mind your own business.

216
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,526
Do you mind our being
talked about, Stella?

217
00:12:08,628 --> 00:12:09,394
Mind?

218
00:12:09,496 --> 00:12:10,895
I mind?

219
00:12:10,997 --> 00:12:12,263
Oh, no.

220
00:12:12,365 --> 00:12:15,633
It's just that-- well, I can't
believe you like seeing me,

221
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:17,435
when you could be out
with all the swells.

222
00:12:17,537 --> 00:12:19,170
I want to be with you.

223
00:12:19,272 --> 00:12:20,605
I like being with you.

224
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:25,477
Um, could I--

225
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:27,112
could I take your arm?

226
00:12:27,214 --> 00:12:28,513
I mean, is that all right?

227
00:12:28,615 --> 00:12:29,380
Is that considered--

228
00:12:35,155 --> 00:12:37,622
I want to be like all the
people you've been around.

229
00:12:37,724 --> 00:12:39,824
Educated, you know,
and speaking nice.

230
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:42,227
Don't be like anyone else.

231
00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:43,361
I like you the way you are.

232
00:12:43,463 --> 00:12:44,963
No, I don't want
to be like me.

233
00:12:45,065 --> 00:12:46,664
Not like the people
in this place,

234
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:48,633
but like the people
in the movie.

235
00:12:48,735 --> 00:12:51,503
You know, doing everything
well-bred and refined.

236
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:52,937
And dull.

237
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:53,805
Stay as you are.

238
00:12:53,907 --> 00:12:55,240
Don't pretend, Stella.

239
00:12:55,342 --> 00:12:58,476
Anyway, it isn't
really well-bred

240
00:12:58,578 --> 00:13:00,111
to act the way you aren't.

241
00:13:00,213 --> 00:13:02,514
But I've wanted to be
different ever since I met you.

242
00:13:02,616 --> 00:13:04,916
And if I was around you
long enough, I could be.

243
00:13:05,018 --> 00:13:07,519
Why, I could learn
to talk like you

244
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:10,688
and act like you,
and pretty soon I--

245
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:13,858
well, you know, you've
done a lot for me

246
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,660
even in these couple of weeks.

247
00:13:15,762 --> 00:13:17,896
You've done a lot for me, too.

248
00:13:17,998 --> 00:13:21,166
I was very lonely the day
you walked in the office.

249
00:13:21,268 --> 00:13:22,133
Oh, no, I--

250
00:13:22,235 --> 00:13:23,001
no thanks.

251
00:13:23,103 --> 00:13:23,768
I don't smoke.

252
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:26,304
And I don't drink, either.

253
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:28,706
I was lonely and unhappy and--

254
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:29,607
and then you--

255
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:31,176
Yes?

256
00:13:39,619 --> 00:13:43,788
Oh, I-- I shouldn't have.

257
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:45,990
You won't have any
respect for me.

258
00:13:46,092 --> 00:13:50,528
Not for girls who let men
kiss them whenever they want.

259
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,263
I-- I mean, I don't let--

260
00:13:52,365 --> 00:13:57,802
I mean-- well, girls
shouldn't, unless they--

261
00:13:57,904 --> 00:14:02,907
well, unless they
know a man is serious.

262
00:14:13,286 --> 00:14:15,820
Hiya, Mom.

263
00:14:15,922 --> 00:14:17,589
Ain't she got home yet?

264
00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:20,458
No.

265
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,127
Does the old man know?

266
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:23,962
Hello, Pop.

267
00:14:24,064 --> 00:14:25,296
What time did Stella get home?

268
00:14:25,398 --> 00:14:26,197
Huh?

269
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:27,699
Oh, oh that was about--

270
00:14:27,801 --> 00:14:29,467
well, that was around,
oh, I don't know.

271
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:30,768
But she woke me up.

272
00:14:30,871 --> 00:14:32,337
Hey, Mom, how about
the coffee, huh?

273
00:14:32,439 --> 00:14:33,371
And Pop's, too.

274
00:14:33,473 --> 00:14:35,073
Tell Stella I want to see her.

275
00:14:35,175 --> 00:14:37,375
Gee, Pop, it was
kind of late, you know.

276
00:14:37,477 --> 00:14:38,209
Let her sleep.

277
00:14:41,414 --> 00:14:43,915
Tell Stella I want to see her.

278
00:14:44,017 --> 00:14:44,749
Yes.

279
00:14:53,026 --> 00:14:54,893
Why-- why, she ain't here.

280
00:14:54,995 --> 00:14:57,095
I wonder where she
could have gone so early.

281
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,399
She ain't slept there!

282
00:15:01,501 --> 00:15:02,967
I guess she spent the
night with Carrie Jenkins.

283
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:04,235
It was raining kind
of hard, you know.

284
00:15:04,337 --> 00:15:05,470
She didn't go out
with Carrie Jenkins, why

285
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:07,205
should stay the night with her?

286
00:15:07,307 --> 00:15:09,908
When she gets home, you
tell her to take her things

287
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:11,776
and be out of here before
I get back, I mean it.

288
00:15:13,013 --> 00:15:14,178
Oh, now, listen,
Pop, you can't.

289
00:15:14,281 --> 00:15:15,146
You got to give her
a chance to explain.

290
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:15,847
You shut up!

291
00:15:15,949 --> 00:15:17,248
Tell her what I said.

292
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:18,783
All right, then, I guess
that goes for me, too.

293
00:15:18,885 --> 00:15:20,418
Charlie, finish your coffee.

294
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,786
I'll talk to your pa.

295
00:15:21,888 --> 00:15:23,655
I don't want any coffee,
or any part of this dump

296
00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:24,522
from now on.

297
00:15:24,624 --> 00:15:25,423
I'm through!

298
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:30,929
I'll tell you later.

299
00:15:31,031 --> 00:15:33,131
Oh, gee, Stella,
where you been?

300
00:15:33,233 --> 00:15:34,532
You know, the old
man's been all--

301
00:15:34,634 --> 00:15:35,667
Look, Charlie, look!

302
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:37,068
- Married?
- Uh-huh!

303
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:37,802
Oh, Stel!

304
00:15:37,904 --> 00:15:39,103
Oh, my gosh.

305
00:15:39,205 --> 00:15:42,173
Aw, gee, Mr. Dallas,
that's swell.

306
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:42,840
Hey, Ma!

307
00:15:42,943 --> 00:15:44,175
Hey, Ma, she's here.

308
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:45,009
She's married.

309
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:45,710
Hey, Ma!

310
00:15:45,812 --> 00:15:46,511
Hey, Pop, it's OK now.

311
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:47,345
She's here.

312
00:16:05,098 --> 00:16:06,564
We're here, Agnes.

313
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:09,133
My, oh, my, you sure is!

314
00:16:09,235 --> 00:16:10,535
And there it is!

315
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:11,936
Yes, ma'am.

316
00:16:12,038 --> 00:16:13,571
Who do it look like?

317
00:16:13,673 --> 00:16:16,174
Let me
see who you look

318
00:16:16,276 --> 00:16:18,042
like, your pappy or your mammy.

319
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:19,711
Go ahead, Agnes,
and open the door.

320
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:21,546
You'll have plenty of
time for that later on.

321
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:22,380
Yes'm.

322
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:24,082
Yes, ma'am.

323
00:16:24,184 --> 00:16:27,518
I know who's gonna be boss
'round here from now on.

324
00:16:36,196 --> 00:16:39,464
Oh, gosh, home never
looked so good to me.

325
00:16:39,566 --> 00:16:40,698
Poor Stella.

326
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,966
Oh, I didn't mind.

327
00:16:42,068 --> 00:16:44,235
It was just the hospital
got on my nerves.

328
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:46,371
And that darn doctor, trying
to make me stay another week.

329
00:16:46,473 --> 00:16:48,473
Well, but Stella, he just
thought it would be better--

330
00:16:48,575 --> 00:16:49,507
Better for who?

331
00:16:49,609 --> 00:16:50,775
It was just to get your money.

332
00:16:50,877 --> 00:16:52,310
I felt as good the
next day as I ever did,

333
00:16:52,412 --> 00:16:56,381
and maybe better than
I had for a while.

334
00:16:56,483 --> 00:16:58,850
Oh, Stephen, why didn't
you bring him to me?

335
00:16:58,952 --> 00:17:01,486
The days wouldn't have
seemed half so long.

336
00:17:01,588 --> 00:17:03,521
Gosh, I thought everybody
had forgotten me.

337
00:17:03,623 --> 00:17:06,457
Now, Mrs. Dallas, I
think we'll get you to bed.

338
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,558
Bed?

339
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,160
I just got up.

340
00:17:09,262 --> 00:17:12,463
Haven't you seen enough of me
in bed for the past three weeks?

341
00:17:12,565 --> 00:17:14,065
Seems like three years to me.

342
00:17:14,167 --> 00:17:17,101
You'll soon find you're not
as strong as you think you are.

343
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:19,170
You must remember I've had
a great deal of experience

344
00:17:19,272 --> 00:17:20,571
in these maternity cases.

345
00:17:20,673 --> 00:17:21,472
Experience?

346
00:17:21,574 --> 00:17:22,974
What do you think I had?

347
00:17:23,076 --> 00:17:25,309
Tell me, why is it doctors
and nurses and husbands

348
00:17:25,412 --> 00:17:26,778
always seem to
think they know more

349
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,446
about this maternity business?

350
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:30,648
Don't you think a mother learns
anything in that little room

351
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:31,883
they wheel them into?

352
00:17:31,985 --> 00:17:33,518
Or is that just a
kindergarten class?

353
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:34,919
Oh, Mrs. Dallas.

354
00:17:35,021 --> 00:17:36,487
Let me tell you something,
I picked up quite a

355
00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:37,955
little experience in that room.

356
00:17:38,058 --> 00:17:40,425
And it wasn't out
of books, either.

357
00:17:40,527 --> 00:17:41,259
Experience.

358
00:17:44,597 --> 00:17:45,663
Stephen!

359
00:17:45,765 --> 00:17:46,531
Stephen!

360
00:17:46,633 --> 00:17:47,832
Yes, dear?

361
00:17:47,934 --> 00:17:51,135
A dance at the River
Club tomorrow night.

362
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:53,104
I think I can wear
my blue dress.

363
00:17:53,206 --> 00:17:54,539
I'll let it out a
little at the top.

364
00:17:54,641 --> 00:17:58,743
But Stella, you don't
want to go dancing already.

365
00:17:58,845 --> 00:18:00,244
Before I went
to the hospital, I

366
00:18:00,346 --> 00:18:02,380
was stuck in this house
for four solid months

367
00:18:02,482 --> 00:18:03,714
without going anywheres.

368
00:18:03,817 --> 00:18:05,550
And we just got
into the River Club.

369
00:18:05,652 --> 00:18:08,286
All my life I've just about
died to go to the real places

370
00:18:08,388 --> 00:18:10,455
and get in with the right
crowd, and when I got a chance

371
00:18:10,557 --> 00:18:12,056
and get started, I
have to give it all up.

372
00:18:12,158 --> 00:18:13,491
Oh, we'll go next time.

373
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:14,792
Well, I
don't want to go next time,

374
00:18:14,894 --> 00:18:16,227
I want to go this time.

375
00:18:16,329 --> 00:18:19,430
Aw, Stephen, I won't
dance much, I promise.

376
00:18:19,532 --> 00:18:21,566
Gee, I just want to get
a wave and a manicure

377
00:18:21,668 --> 00:18:24,035
and get all dressed up
again, and go hear some music

378
00:18:24,137 --> 00:18:28,272
and forget all about doctors
and hospitals and nurses.

379
00:18:28,374 --> 00:18:30,541
And babies?

380
00:18:33,913 --> 00:18:36,647
Mm, aw.

381
00:18:36,749 --> 00:18:39,717
Aw, but Steven, please.

382
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:49,894
Well, you're a
wonderful dancer, Mr. Munn!

383
00:18:49,996 --> 00:18:52,029
Well, if I'm any
judge of horseflesh,

384
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:53,664
you don't shake a
mean leg yourself.

385
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:58,402
Hello!

386
00:18:58,505 --> 00:18:59,704
Hello.

387
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:01,472
Who's that she's dancing with?

388
00:19:01,574 --> 00:19:02,240
He's pretty good, too.

389
00:19:02,342 --> 00:19:04,041
I-- I really don't know.

390
00:19:04,144 --> 00:19:05,543
His name is Munn.

391
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:07,478
He has something to
do with horse races.

392
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,847
The girls invite him
over for golf, and he--

393
00:19:09,949 --> 00:19:13,184
he gives them tips!

394
00:19:13,286 --> 00:19:15,186
How'd you come to get hooked
up to a table like that?

395
00:19:15,288 --> 00:19:17,021
Oh, they're some business
friends of my husband's.

396
00:19:17,123 --> 00:19:18,523
Business friends?

397
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:19,790
What is he, an undertaker?

398
00:19:24,264 --> 00:19:26,697
Oh, why don't you get him to
ditch that bunch of moss bags

399
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:27,865
and come over and join us?

400
00:19:27,967 --> 00:19:29,834
Spencer Chandler's table?

401
00:19:29,936 --> 00:19:31,836
Well, we don't even know him.

402
00:19:31,938 --> 00:19:34,172
Well, that won't take long.

403
00:19:34,274 --> 00:19:35,740
You know what he said
after our first dance?

404
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:36,974
No, what?

405
00:19:37,076 --> 00:19:38,409
He said, Ed-- he
always calls me Ed.

406
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:40,478
He said, Ed, you can pick
winners on a dance floor

407
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:41,946
better than you
can on a racetrack.

408
00:19:42,048 --> 00:19:43,714
Yeah?

409
00:19:43,816 --> 00:19:45,783
Aw, go on, don't red-apple me.

410
00:19:45,885 --> 00:19:46,918
No, on the level.

411
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,252
Come on, I'll prove it to you.

412
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:52,023
Well, I'd, um, I have
to ask Stephen first.

413
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:52,924
Stephen?

414
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:53,791
Yes?

415
00:19:53,893 --> 00:19:54,959
Come here.

416
00:19:55,061 --> 00:19:56,761
Excuse me.

417
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:57,762
Yes?

418
00:19:57,864 --> 00:19:59,630
Stephen, this is Mr. Munn.

419
00:19:59,732 --> 00:20:00,865
Howya?

420
00:20:00,967 --> 00:20:02,733
Mr. Chandler,
Spencer Chandler,

421
00:20:02,835 --> 00:20:05,303
wants us to come
over to his table.

422
00:20:05,405 --> 00:20:06,637
I'm sorry, we're just leaving.

423
00:20:06,739 --> 00:20:07,672
Leaving?

424
00:20:07,774 --> 00:20:08,973
Why, it's only quarter after.

425
00:20:09,075 --> 00:20:10,107
I know, but
that's late for us.

426
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,142
Aw, come just for a nightcap.

427
00:20:11,244 --> 00:20:13,010
Oh, yes, Stephen, please.

428
00:20:13,112 --> 00:20:14,412
I'm afraid we
can't, thank you.

429
00:20:14,514 --> 00:20:15,246
Good night.

430
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:20,051
Hm.

431
00:20:20,153 --> 00:20:21,919
Good night.

432
00:20:22,021 --> 00:20:23,120
I'll get the things.

433
00:20:27,293 --> 00:20:29,093
He dug down in his
pocket, got his last cent,

434
00:20:29,195 --> 00:20:30,628
and the horse came in
and paid 20 to one!

435
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,163
- 20 to one!
- What do you think of that?

436
00:20:36,769 --> 00:20:37,735
Oh, dear, I--
I--

437
00:20:37,837 --> 00:20:38,736
Did you lose something?

438
00:20:38,838 --> 00:20:39,670
Well, yes, I--

439
00:20:39,772 --> 00:20:40,571
What was it?

440
00:20:40,673 --> 00:20:41,439
May I help you?

441
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:42,340
Oh, I remember.

442
00:20:42,442 --> 00:20:45,142
I gave it to Mr., uh, pardon me.

443
00:20:49,515 --> 00:20:50,181
What do you think of that?

444
00:20:50,283 --> 00:20:51,415
What a story.

445
00:20:51,517 --> 00:20:52,583
Say, Ed.

446
00:20:52,685 --> 00:20:54,685
Did you give me back
my handkerchief?

447
00:20:54,787 --> 00:20:55,653
You never gave it to me.

448
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:56,854
Oh, I must have lost it.

449
00:20:56,956 --> 00:20:57,755
Well, here.

450
00:20:57,857 --> 00:20:58,756
Take mine.

451
00:20:58,858 --> 00:21:00,157
Oh, no, no, didn't mean I--

452
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,459
Well, wait a minute.

453
00:21:01,561 --> 00:21:02,627
I want you to meet a
friend of mine, Stella.

454
00:21:05,398 --> 00:21:07,431
Mr. Chandler, this
is Mrs. Dallas.

455
00:21:07,533 --> 00:21:08,065
How do you do?

456
00:21:08,167 --> 00:21:09,634
How do you do?

457
00:21:09,736 --> 00:21:11,235
Say, Spence, I want you to
prove something to her for me.

458
00:21:11,337 --> 00:21:12,370
Didn't you say I could
pick 'em on a dance floor

459
00:21:12,472 --> 00:21:14,038
as good as on the track?
- Mm-hm.

460
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,373
But I wouldn't
feel too flattered.

461
00:21:15,475 --> 00:21:17,041
Munn hasn't given me a
winner in over a month.

462
00:21:18,111 --> 00:21:18,843
Will you sit down?

463
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:20,177
Oh, thank you.

464
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,680
Mrs. Dallas, I'd like
you to meet Miss Terry.

465
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:24,715
Oh, I believe your
wife lost something

466
00:21:24,817 --> 00:21:26,117
and she thought maybe Mr.--

467
00:21:26,219 --> 00:21:27,084
Mr. Munn.

468
00:21:27,186 --> 00:21:28,019
Mr. Munn might know.

469
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:28,853
Well, thank you.

470
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:33,224
Oh, Stephen.

471
00:21:33,326 --> 00:21:34,492
Stephen, this is Mr. Chandler.

472
00:21:34,594 --> 00:21:35,893
Mr. Chandler, my husband.
- How do you do?

473
00:21:35,995 --> 00:21:37,061
Mr. Chandler just
asked me to dance.

474
00:21:37,163 --> 00:21:38,462
You don't mind.

475
00:21:38,564 --> 00:21:39,430
I'm sorry, my wife's
just out of the hospital.

476
00:21:39,532 --> 00:21:40,431
She should be home in bed.

477
00:21:40,533 --> 00:21:41,932
Oh, well, we'll hurry then.

478
00:21:42,035 --> 00:21:42,767
Come on.

479
00:21:48,941 --> 00:21:50,941
Mr. Dallas, you wouldn't
like to sit down and have

480
00:21:51,044 --> 00:21:51,909
a little snifter, would you?

481
00:21:52,011 --> 00:21:53,444
No, thank you.

482
00:22:11,197 --> 00:22:11,929
Thank you.

483
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,713
What have I done this time?

484
00:22:28,815 --> 00:22:31,182
All right, I'll
take my usual lecture.

485
00:22:31,284 --> 00:22:32,516
Go ahead, begin.

486
00:22:32,618 --> 00:22:35,019
Stella, I asked you not
to wear those earrings.

487
00:22:35,121 --> 00:22:37,421
That cheap imitation necklace.

488
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:41,225
You took them off, you agreed,
then after we got there you

489
00:22:41,327 --> 00:22:42,259
came out of the dressing room--

490
00:22:42,362 --> 00:22:43,694
Now, Stephen.

491
00:22:43,796 --> 00:22:46,030
I'm perfectly willing to
let you tell me how to talk

492
00:22:46,132 --> 00:22:48,299
and how to act, but
please don't give

493
00:22:48,401 --> 00:22:50,034
me pointers on how to dress.

494
00:22:50,136 --> 00:22:53,871
Allow me at least to know more
about one thing than you do.

495
00:22:53,973 --> 00:22:58,409
After all, I've always been
known to have stacks of style.

496
00:22:58,511 --> 00:23:00,945
You should have heard Ed Munn,
and he's been around a bit,

497
00:23:01,047 --> 00:23:01,979
too.

498
00:23:02,081 --> 00:23:05,416
He's traveled further and he--

499
00:23:05,518 --> 00:23:07,618
all right then, farther,
whichever it is.

500
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,953
I don't care.

501
00:23:09,055 --> 00:23:12,189
Gosh, I have to think twice
every time I open my mouth.

502
00:23:12,291 --> 00:23:14,091
And Spencer Chandler
didn't seem to have

503
00:23:14,193 --> 00:23:15,860
to turn the other way, either.

504
00:23:15,962 --> 00:23:18,562
And he only happens to
be one of The Chandlers.

505
00:23:18,664 --> 00:23:20,431
Stella, please.

506
00:23:20,533 --> 00:23:22,400
Don't say things like that.

507
00:23:22,502 --> 00:23:23,701
Remember you're my wife now.

508
00:23:23,803 --> 00:23:25,970
Oh, and can't
look at another man!

509
00:23:26,072 --> 00:23:27,004
That isn't the point at all.

510
00:23:27,106 --> 00:23:28,639
Oh-ho, that's a laugh.

511
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:31,976
An affair between Spencer
Chandler and I. Well,

512
00:23:32,078 --> 00:23:33,944
I am coming up in the world!

513
00:23:41,587 --> 00:23:45,289
Stella, can't you, won't
you try to understand?

514
00:23:45,391 --> 00:23:48,225
Please listen to me
this time, please.

515
00:23:48,327 --> 00:23:50,194
The fake jewelry's
not important.

516
00:23:50,296 --> 00:23:51,762
Chandler's not important.

517
00:23:51,864 --> 00:23:54,465
None of these things
matter in themselves.

518
00:23:54,567 --> 00:23:55,800
But what's to become of us?

519
00:23:55,902 --> 00:23:58,669
That is important.

520
00:23:58,771 --> 00:23:59,537
Yes, dear.

521
00:23:59,639 --> 00:24:01,739
Stella, why did you marry me?

522
00:24:04,377 --> 00:24:06,143
Because I was crazy
about you, silly.

523
00:24:06,245 --> 00:24:09,046
And I-- I still am, only--

524
00:24:09,148 --> 00:24:10,581
only you just don't
seem to ever--

525
00:24:10,683 --> 00:24:13,117
Once, a long time ago, you
said you were crazy to learn

526
00:24:13,219 --> 00:24:15,653
everything, become someone.

527
00:24:15,755 --> 00:24:16,954
Didn't you?

528
00:24:17,056 --> 00:24:18,789
Yes, Stephen.

529
00:24:18,891 --> 00:24:20,424
Please listen to me.

530
00:24:20,526 --> 00:24:22,560
I'm only telling you
this because I love you.

531
00:24:25,398 --> 00:24:26,664
Beamer wants to
send me to New York

532
00:24:26,766 --> 00:24:28,866
to handle the sales
department there.

533
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:30,601
I want to go.

534
00:24:30,703 --> 00:24:33,204
And I want to take you with me.

535
00:24:33,306 --> 00:24:34,705
But I want you to
make an effort.

536
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:40,744
I want you to try to be
what you wanted to be.

537
00:24:40,847 --> 00:24:44,815
Give up a few things for me,
and try to adapt yourself--

538
00:24:44,917 --> 00:24:46,484
Adapt myself?

539
00:24:46,586 --> 00:24:49,420
Give up a few things?

540
00:24:49,522 --> 00:24:52,356
What have I been doing
ever since I met you?

541
00:24:52,458 --> 00:24:54,492
And I'm getting a
little sick of it, too.

542
00:24:54,594 --> 00:24:57,628
How would it be for you to do
a little adapting for a change?

543
00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:00,264
I don't see you
giving up anything.

544
00:25:00,366 --> 00:25:01,966
And I'll tell you
one more thing.

545
00:25:02,068 --> 00:25:03,467
I'm not going to New York.

546
00:25:03,569 --> 00:25:05,002
I'm certainly not
going to leave here

547
00:25:05,104 --> 00:25:07,972
just when I'm beginning to
get in with the right people.

548
00:25:08,074 --> 00:25:09,206
Now, Stella.

549
00:25:09,308 --> 00:25:11,108
You-- you go on
and go to New York.

550
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:14,245
I want to stay here.

551
00:25:14,347 --> 00:25:15,579
Well, can you beat that?

552
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:17,982
Laying here wide awake,
waiting for her dinner

553
00:25:18,084 --> 00:25:19,483
and not a squawk out of her.

554
00:25:28,561 --> 00:25:30,461
Gosh, Carrie.

555
00:25:30,563 --> 00:25:32,463
You know, I used to think
girls at the mill were crazy

556
00:25:32,565 --> 00:25:34,365
when they got married and
right off the bat started

557
00:25:34,467 --> 00:25:35,666
having kids.

558
00:25:35,768 --> 00:25:37,935
But honest, Stella,
would you want any more?

559
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:40,504
Sure, if I could have
another one like her.

560
00:25:40,606 --> 00:25:42,339
She's been a regular pal to me.

561
00:25:42,441 --> 00:25:44,208
Since Stephen's been
away in New York so much,

562
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:45,809
I hardly know I have a husband.

563
00:25:45,912 --> 00:25:47,778
Why, he's only been here
three times this summer,

564
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,213
and then it was
only account of her.

565
00:25:49,315 --> 00:25:51,448
He's crazy about her.

566
00:25:51,551 --> 00:25:53,918
And who wouldn't be?

567
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,619
Oh, look at her!

568
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:58,522
Wiping it up at her
age, can you beat that?

569
00:25:58,624 --> 00:26:00,457
She's the spit of her old man!

570
00:26:03,329 --> 00:26:04,762
Now, who is that?

571
00:26:04,864 --> 00:26:06,897
Agnes?

572
00:26:06,999 --> 00:26:09,199
Well, is this all
the welcome I get?

573
00:26:09,302 --> 00:26:10,034
Ed!

574
00:26:10,136 --> 00:26:12,736
Of all people!

575
00:26:12,838 --> 00:26:14,939
Oh gosh, I'm glad to see you!

576
00:26:15,041 --> 00:26:16,407
And I you.

577
00:26:16,509 --> 00:26:19,543
I haven't seen you for ages.

578
00:26:19,645 --> 00:26:21,412
Get a load of that kid.

579
00:26:21,514 --> 00:26:23,180
Has she grown or am I crazy?

580
00:26:23,282 --> 00:26:25,649
Come on.

581
00:26:25,751 --> 00:26:28,185
Oh gee, Stella, she looks
more like you every time.

582
00:26:30,523 --> 00:26:32,456
You remember Uncle
Ed, don't you, darling?

583
00:26:32,558 --> 00:26:34,024
Well, I remember you.

584
00:26:35,194 --> 00:26:35,926
Oh!

585
00:26:36,028 --> 00:26:36,894
Ed!

586
00:26:36,996 --> 00:26:37,728
Oh!

587
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:38,796
How's that?

588
00:26:38,898 --> 00:26:41,999
Oh, Ed, you shouldn't
have done this!

589
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:44,401
Oh, don't she look
like a little queen?

590
00:26:44,503 --> 00:26:46,637
All in gold and turquoise.

591
00:26:46,739 --> 00:26:48,205
Edna!

592
00:26:48,307 --> 00:26:49,673
You want a drink, don't you?

593
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:50,774
Sure.

594
00:26:50,876 --> 00:26:52,276
And if you don't mind,
I'll peel this coat.

595
00:26:52,378 --> 00:26:53,777
Oh, sure, go ahead.

596
00:26:53,879 --> 00:26:55,145
What'll it be?

597
00:26:55,247 --> 00:26:57,314
Well, you know me, Stella,
I ain't partic', so long as it

598
00:26:57,416 --> 00:26:58,616
don't jump up and bite me.

599
00:26:58,718 --> 00:27:00,451
But I've been drinking bourbon.

600
00:27:00,553 --> 00:27:01,485
What have you been drinking?

601
00:27:01,587 --> 00:27:02,519
Oh, nothing.

602
00:27:02,622 --> 00:27:03,821
But I'll take bourbon.

603
00:27:05,091 --> 00:27:07,091
Aw, gee, Stel, you
oughta been along.

604
00:27:07,193 --> 00:27:08,859
Or maybe you've been
having too much fun here.

605
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:11,295
Gosh, Ed, I haven't been out
of the house for two months.

606
00:27:11,397 --> 00:27:12,196
Been sick?

607
00:27:12,298 --> 00:27:13,731
No, but-- I don't know.

608
00:27:13,833 --> 00:27:15,866
I don't seem to get any fun
out of a good time anymore.

609
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:17,768
All the time I'm out,
I'm thinking of her

610
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:23,173
and what she's doing and how
soon I can get back to her.

611
00:27:23,275 --> 00:27:24,642
Well, here's
hoping I'll always

612
00:27:24,744 --> 00:27:28,178
be around at the right time.

613
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,013
What are you drinking?

614
00:27:29,115 --> 00:27:30,114
Sarsaparilla.

615
00:27:30,216 --> 00:27:34,451
Stealing
the kids' drinks, huh?

616
00:27:34,553 --> 00:27:36,253
Did you ever catch her
sneaking your oatmeal?

617
00:27:37,289 --> 00:27:38,489
Hey, can I pick her up?

618
00:27:38,591 --> 00:27:39,523
Sure, go ahead!

619
00:27:42,695 --> 00:27:45,029
Come on to your uncle Ed.

620
00:27:45,131 --> 00:27:46,196
Gotcha, girl.

621
00:27:46,298 --> 00:27:47,731
Come on.

622
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:50,067
Ain't you got a big
smile for your uncle Ed?

623
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:51,068
Of course she has.

624
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:52,069
Come on, darlin'.

625
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:53,437
Smile for uncle Ed.

626
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:55,806
Edna?

627
00:27:57,109 --> 00:27:58,375
Edna!

628
00:27:58,477 --> 00:27:59,777
I'll get it.

629
00:27:59,879 --> 00:28:02,980
If I could only see her
open that door just once.

630
00:28:03,082 --> 00:28:06,116
Come on, darlin'.

631
00:28:07,486 --> 00:28:08,385
Come on, darling.

632
00:28:09,755 --> 00:28:12,356
STELLA AND ED COAXING

633
00:28:23,436 --> 00:28:25,736
Stella?

634
00:28:25,838 --> 00:28:30,407
Oh, um-- oh, you
remember Mr. Munn.

635
00:28:30,509 --> 00:28:31,642
How do you do?

636
00:28:31,744 --> 00:28:32,676
And Carrie Jenkins.

637
00:28:32,778 --> 00:28:34,244
Yes, how do you do.

638
00:28:34,346 --> 00:28:35,079
How do you do?

639
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:40,284
I think I'll be getting along.

640
00:28:43,155 --> 00:28:44,254
Yes, darling.

641
00:28:44,356 --> 00:28:46,190
That's a fine baby you've
got there, Mr. Dallas.

642
00:28:46,292 --> 00:28:47,391
Thank you.
I think so.

643
00:28:47,493 --> 00:28:48,392
I gotta be going too, Ed.

644
00:28:48,494 --> 00:28:51,528
Oh, me, too.

645
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:55,165
Yeah, just a minute,
I'll see you to the door.

646
00:28:55,267 --> 00:28:57,167
Listen, Stella,
you call me soon, will you?

647
00:28:57,269 --> 00:28:58,001
Yeah.

648
00:28:58,104 --> 00:28:58,702
All right.

649
00:28:58,804 --> 00:29:00,237
Thanks for a good time.

650
00:29:00,339 --> 00:29:01,071
Bye.

651
00:29:05,311 --> 00:29:08,412
Stella, I can't have
our child living this way.

652
00:29:08,514 --> 00:29:09,847
What's wrong this time?

653
00:29:09,949 --> 00:29:11,482
It's not just this time.

654
00:29:11,584 --> 00:29:13,016
It's every time I--

655
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:14,485
What do you mean, because
there was a couple of drinks?

656
00:29:14,587 --> 00:29:16,120
Well, what's wrong with that?

657
00:29:16,222 --> 00:29:18,555
Coming in here with that
icebergy way of yours.

658
00:29:18,657 --> 00:29:20,023
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to be rude.

659
00:29:20,826 --> 00:29:22,760
But she's my child, too.

660
00:29:22,862 --> 00:29:24,194
And I won't have this.

661
00:29:24,296 --> 00:29:26,497
I hadn't wanted to take
Laurel away from you, but--

662
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:29,233
if you--

663
00:29:29,335 --> 00:29:32,402
Take her away from me?

664
00:29:32,505 --> 00:29:34,204
What are you talking about?

665
00:29:34,306 --> 00:29:36,006
How dare you say such a thing?

666
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:37,141
Give her to me!

667
00:29:37,243 --> 00:29:38,208
Now, Stella.

668
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,743
- Give her to me, I say!
- Stella, please.

669
00:29:39,845 --> 00:29:40,911
You mustn't do this, now.
- Give her to me!

670
00:29:41,013 --> 00:29:41,745
Stella!

671
00:29:41,847 --> 00:29:42,880
Watch out, you're hurting her!

672
00:29:42,982 --> 00:29:43,547
Stella.

673
00:29:43,649 --> 00:29:44,681
Get off.

674
00:29:47,553 --> 00:29:49,653
Did he frighten
Mummy's little girl?

675
00:29:49,755 --> 00:29:52,222
Oh, don't you cry.

676
00:29:52,324 --> 00:29:53,357
Mummy's right here.

677
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:54,591
Mummy won't let
anybody hurt you.

678
00:30:03,068 --> 00:30:03,934
There, there.

679
00:30:06,572 --> 00:30:08,906
You're here with Mummy, and
nobody in the whole world

680
00:30:09,008 --> 00:30:11,875
is ever going to take you away.

681
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:12,743
Nobody.

682
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:15,746
Nobody.

683
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:38,602
Thank you.

684
00:30:38,704 --> 00:30:40,404
Boy.

685
00:30:40,506 --> 00:30:42,039
The whole thing.

686
00:30:43,275 --> 00:30:45,108
Would you like to
include one of those, too?

687
00:30:45,211 --> 00:30:48,979
No, she's a little too grown
up for that now, I'm afraid.

688
00:30:49,081 --> 00:30:51,181
Come on fellas,
Mother's ready.

689
00:30:51,283 --> 00:30:52,282
Come on, boys.

690
00:30:52,384 --> 00:30:54,518
Mother, he rows it himself!

691
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:56,553
Aw, can't we wait
until he winds it again?

692
00:30:56,655 --> 00:30:58,522
I want you to see how it goes.

693
00:30:58,624 --> 00:30:59,923
Thank you, Mr. Dallas.

694
00:31:00,025 --> 00:31:01,425
You'll send those
right away, won't you?

695
00:31:01,527 --> 00:31:02,259
Yes.

696
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:03,627
Stephen?

697
00:31:03,729 --> 00:31:05,062
Helen.

698
00:31:05,164 --> 00:31:06,697
Oh, Stephen!

699
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:08,232
Oh, I'm so glad to see you.

700
00:31:08,334 --> 00:31:09,499
Oh, and you.

701
00:31:09,602 --> 00:31:10,734
Oh, boys, come.

702
00:31:10,836 --> 00:31:13,036
Come here, please.

703
00:31:13,138 --> 00:31:14,104
Stephen, these are my sons.

704
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:15,272
How do you do,
young gentlemen?

705
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:16,640
How do you do?

706
00:31:16,742 --> 00:31:18,542
Oh, this is Mr.
Dallas, whom your mother

707
00:31:18,644 --> 00:31:20,510
has known for such a long time.

708
00:31:20,613 --> 00:31:21,712
John.
- John.

709
00:31:21,814 --> 00:31:22,779
How do you do?
Lee.

710
00:31:22,882 --> 00:31:24,081
Lee.
- How do you do?

711
00:31:24,183 --> 00:31:25,215
And Cornelius.
Cornelius.

712
00:31:25,317 --> 00:31:26,250
- How do you do?
- Con.

713
00:31:26,352 --> 00:31:28,418
He doesn't like to
be called Cornelius.

714
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,753
I do, too.

715
00:31:29,855 --> 00:31:32,422
It was my father's name.

716
00:31:32,524 --> 00:31:33,557
Was?

717
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:34,892
Con's the man
of the family now.

718
00:31:34,994 --> 00:31:37,361
And he looks after us
all so beautifully,

719
00:31:37,463 --> 00:31:38,662
his father would be very proud.

720
00:31:38,764 --> 00:31:39,930
That's splendid.

721
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:41,098
Nothing but the finest
care in the world

722
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,499
would be good enough
for your mother.

723
00:31:42,601 --> 00:31:44,167
Oh, but Stephen,
tell us about you.

724
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:45,869
Oh, I gave up all
thought of ever seeing

725
00:31:45,971 --> 00:31:48,272
you again such a long time ago.

726
00:31:48,374 --> 00:31:49,506
What are you doing here?

727
00:31:49,608 --> 00:31:51,041
Well, if you mean New
York, I'm in business here.

728
00:31:51,143 --> 00:31:52,276
If you mean the store,
I'm here buying birthday

729
00:31:52,378 --> 00:31:53,243
presents for my daughter.

730
00:31:53,345 --> 00:31:54,077
Your daughter?

731
00:31:54,179 --> 00:31:56,513
Oh, Stephen!

732
00:31:56,615 --> 00:31:57,681
There she is.

733
00:31:57,783 --> 00:31:58,582
Ooh, pretty!

734
00:31:58,684 --> 00:31:59,449
Oh, she's lovely.

735
00:31:59,551 --> 00:32:00,417
Thank you.

736
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:01,685
Oh, when may we meet her?

737
00:32:01,787 --> 00:32:02,519
And her mother?

738
00:32:02,621 --> 00:32:03,854
They're not here.

739
00:32:03,956 --> 00:32:05,255
You see, Laurel goes to
school up near Boston

740
00:32:05,357 --> 00:32:06,456
and her mother spends
all of her time with her.

741
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:07,858
Oh.

742
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,726
Oh, I have so many things
to hear, and to tell.

743
00:32:09,828 --> 00:32:11,061
Can you lunch with us?

744
00:32:11,163 --> 00:32:13,864
Well, I should be back
at the office by now.

745
00:32:13,966 --> 00:32:16,099
We'd be glad to have you,
Mr. Dallas, if you don't

746
00:32:16,201 --> 00:32:17,367
mind carrying your own tray.

747
00:32:17,469 --> 00:32:18,969
John's been saving
up for a whole month

748
00:32:19,071 --> 00:32:20,470
in order to take us for lunch.

749
00:32:20,572 --> 00:32:21,438
It's his treat.

750
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:22,906
That's all right.

751
00:32:23,008 --> 00:32:25,275
I got enough for one more,
if you don't eat too much.

752
00:32:26,145 --> 00:32:27,978
How about it, Mr. Dallas?

753
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,713
Well, I guess I can't
refuse an offer like that.

754
00:32:29,815 --> 00:32:31,581
Oh, good.

755
00:32:31,684 --> 00:32:33,817
If you run short,
I'll lend you a couple dollars.

756
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:36,887
Gee, thanks.

757
00:32:36,989 --> 00:32:40,257
Oh, books again.

758
00:32:40,359 --> 00:32:42,559
Sometimes I've got a good
mind to write and tell him

759
00:32:42,661 --> 00:32:44,294
she can get books
from the library,

760
00:32:44,396 --> 00:32:48,432
but there's no place where you
can get a fur coat for nothing.

761
00:32:48,534 --> 00:32:54,538
Boy, what I wouldn't
give to see her in one.

762
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,405
Oh, well.

763
00:32:55,507 --> 00:32:56,840
Here.

764
00:32:56,942 --> 00:32:58,241
Hide them with the rest and
let me get on with this,

765
00:32:58,344 --> 00:32:59,710
or it won't be
ready for Christmas,

766
00:32:59,812 --> 00:33:00,844
let alone her birthday.

767
00:33:04,416 --> 00:33:05,248
Hello, Gladys.

768
00:33:05,351 --> 00:33:05,949
Where's Mother?

769
00:33:06,051 --> 00:33:07,351
Now, let me see.

770
00:33:07,453 --> 00:33:09,219
Uh, she's-- um, she's--

771
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:11,254
Hello, Mother.

772
00:33:11,357 --> 00:33:12,589
Hello darling.

773
00:33:12,691 --> 00:33:14,458
Mother, Miss Phillibrown,
my teacher, came home with me.

774
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,059
She wants to see you.

775
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:17,627
Oh, Lolly, if I'd only known,
I could have fixed up a little.

776
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:18,462
Look at me, I'm a sight!

777
00:33:18,564 --> 00:33:19,763
But you look fine!

778
00:33:19,865 --> 00:33:21,465
Oh, no, look at the
things all-- oh, dear.

779
00:33:24,036 --> 00:33:26,303
Mother, this is
Miss Phillibrown.

780
00:33:26,405 --> 00:33:27,504
Oh.

781
00:33:27,606 --> 00:33:28,505
How do you do, Mrs. Dallas?

782
00:33:28,607 --> 00:33:29,806
Pleased to meet you.

783
00:33:29,908 --> 00:33:31,141
Won't you sit down?

784
00:33:31,243 --> 00:33:35,078
Oh, really, I haven't
a minute, but thank you.

785
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,647
Laurel, my dear, I wonder if
I might have a glass of water.

786
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:38,782
- Oh, of course.
- You too, Mother?

787
00:33:38,884 --> 00:33:40,050
No.

788
00:33:40,152 --> 00:33:41,218
Maybe she'd rather
have some sarsaparilla.

789
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,352
I have some on ice.
- No, thank you.

790
00:33:42,454 --> 00:33:43,687
All right.

791
00:33:43,789 --> 00:33:45,022
She's such a darling.

792
00:33:45,124 --> 00:33:46,323
You know, I didn't want
to talk in front of her

793
00:33:46,425 --> 00:33:48,458
in case she might
be disappointed.

794
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:51,561
I spend the weekends in Boston,
and I wonder if you would let

795
00:33:51,663 --> 00:33:53,397
me borrow Laurel for this one.

796
00:33:53,499 --> 00:33:56,433
I, um, I couldn't get
her ready this time,

797
00:33:56,535 --> 00:33:58,035
but if you'd ask her again--

798
00:33:58,137 --> 00:34:00,637
oh, Lolly thinks the world and
all of you, Miss Phillibrown.

799
00:34:00,739 --> 00:34:02,472
I know she'd have
a wonderful time.

800
00:34:02,574 --> 00:34:06,143
Seeing some decent shows,
I mean, not just movies.

801
00:34:06,245 --> 00:34:09,546
Well, I had in mind the
galleries and museums.

802
00:34:09,648 --> 00:34:10,847
She seemed so interested.

803
00:34:10,949 --> 00:34:12,049
Oh, yeah.

804
00:34:12,151 --> 00:34:13,350
Yeah, she's crazy
about that stuff.

805
00:34:13,452 --> 00:34:15,385
She gets that stuff
from her father.

806
00:34:15,487 --> 00:34:17,154
Her father?

807
00:34:17,256 --> 00:34:19,623
You see, I've only
heard about you.

808
00:34:19,725 --> 00:34:21,091
Oh.

809
00:34:21,193 --> 00:34:23,193
Well, of course, she don't
see as much of her father.

810
00:34:23,295 --> 00:34:25,362
Mr. Dallas's business
keeps him in New York.

811
00:34:25,464 --> 00:34:26,596
Oh, really?

812
00:34:26,698 --> 00:34:27,998
But I always spend his
vacation with him, don't I,

813
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,099
Mother?
- Uh-huh.

814
00:34:29,201 --> 00:34:30,434
Up in Maine, in the woods.

815
00:34:30,536 --> 00:34:31,334
Have you ever been there?

816
00:34:31,437 --> 00:34:31,968
No.

817
00:34:32,071 --> 00:34:33,637
Oh, it's beautiful!

818
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:35,839
Your mother has just given
her permission for you to spend

819
00:34:35,941 --> 00:34:38,341
a weekend with me in Boston.

820
00:34:38,444 --> 00:34:39,276
When?

821
00:34:39,378 --> 00:34:40,811
Very soon.

822
00:34:40,913 --> 00:34:44,648
Oh, thank you
Miss Phillibrown!

823
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:45,816
Well, I really must go.

824
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:49,453
Oh, must you?

825
00:34:49,555 --> 00:34:50,654
Goodbye, Mrs. Dallas.

826
00:34:50,756 --> 00:34:51,555
Goodbye.

827
00:34:51,657 --> 00:34:52,389
Come again, won't you?

828
00:34:52,491 --> 00:34:54,057
Thank you.

829
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:55,192
Goodbye, Laurel, dear.

830
00:34:55,294 --> 00:34:58,095
Goodbye, Miss Phillibrown.

831
00:34:58,197 --> 00:34:59,930
Oh, Mother, isn't
she the nicest?

832
00:35:00,032 --> 00:35:00,964
Yes, darling.

833
00:35:01,066 --> 00:35:02,199
Did you ask her to the party?

834
00:35:02,301 --> 00:35:02,899
No.

835
00:35:03,001 --> 00:35:03,733
Do you think she'd come?

836
00:35:03,836 --> 00:35:04,568
Of course.

837
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:05,402
Why not?

838
00:35:08,006 --> 00:35:08,905
Mother!

839
00:35:09,007 --> 00:35:10,474
For the party?

840
00:35:10,576 --> 00:35:12,843
Lolly!

841
00:35:12,945 --> 00:35:14,177
What did you do that for?

842
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:15,479
You're always sticking your--

843
00:35:15,581 --> 00:35:16,913
Oh, Mother, I'm sorry.

844
00:35:18,784 --> 00:35:21,485
Oh, come here, darling.

845
00:35:21,587 --> 00:35:23,520
I didn't mean it.

846
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:27,791
You know how I always
fly off, and well, I

847
00:35:27,893 --> 00:35:29,126
wanted it to be a surprise.

848
00:35:33,899 --> 00:35:37,067
Well, now that
you've seen it, you

849
00:35:37,169 --> 00:35:38,969
may as well slip
it on and let me

850
00:35:39,071 --> 00:35:41,838
fit you instead of this thing.

851
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:42,806
Dummy.

852
00:35:42,908 --> 00:35:43,907
Oh, it's blue!

853
00:35:44,009 --> 00:35:44,741
Mm-hm.

854
00:35:55,988 --> 00:35:56,720
There.

855
00:36:02,227 --> 00:36:03,727
Oh, Mother, it's beautiful!

856
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:05,996
Careful, don't
mash the ruffles.

857
00:36:06,098 --> 00:36:08,565
Now, oh, yeah, I forgot.

858
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:09,399
This goes here.

859
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:10,233
Oh, no.

860
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:11,401
Oh yes, it gives it some snap.

861
00:36:11,503 --> 00:36:12,669
No, please.

862
00:36:12,771 --> 00:36:14,204
Oh, for heaven's sake,
you're just like your father.

863
00:36:14,306 --> 00:36:15,572
You want everything as
plain as an old shoe.

864
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:16,840
Plain?

865
00:36:16,942 --> 00:36:18,408
With all these beautiful
handmade ruffles?

866
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,110
Now turn around.

867
00:36:20,212 --> 00:36:22,078
Yes, the length's all right,
it's just the sleeves.

868
00:36:22,181 --> 00:36:25,782
All right, take it off
and let me get on with it.

869
00:36:25,884 --> 00:36:26,683
Yoo-hoo!

870
00:36:26,785 --> 00:36:27,817
What's going on there?

871
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:28,952
Come on in, Ed!

872
00:36:29,054 --> 00:36:31,955
No, Mother, wait
till I get out!

873
00:36:32,057 --> 00:36:33,623
What is this, a
Follies dressing room?

874
00:36:33,725 --> 00:36:34,524
Mother please!

875
00:36:34,626 --> 00:36:36,626
Oh, what's the matter?

876
00:36:36,728 --> 00:36:38,195
He shouldn't see me like this!

877
00:36:38,297 --> 00:36:40,363
For heaven's sake, Ed's known
you since you were knee high

878
00:36:40,465 --> 00:36:42,065
and seen you with
hardly anything on.

879
00:36:42,167 --> 00:36:43,400
Yes, and even less than that.

880
00:36:43,502 --> 00:36:45,001
Now, what have you got
to hide from your uncle?

881
00:36:45,103 --> 00:36:46,036
You've got nothing to
hide, come on, let me see.

882
00:36:46,138 --> 00:36:46,937
Mother, make him stop, please!

883
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:47,971
Oh, Ed, stop!

884
00:36:48,073 --> 00:36:49,272
Lolly, don't be a little fool.

885
00:36:49,374 --> 00:36:50,874
- Come on, let me--
- No!

886
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:55,278
Oh, Ed, I wish you
wouldn't tease her like that.

887
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:56,580
You know she don't like it.

888
00:36:56,682 --> 00:36:57,948
I know, but I get a
kick out of a young one

889
00:36:58,050 --> 00:36:59,849
being so finicky.

890
00:36:59,952 --> 00:37:02,819
Well.

891
00:37:02,921 --> 00:37:05,121
Your car downstairs?
- No.

892
00:37:05,224 --> 00:37:06,423
No, it's in the shop, why?

893
00:37:06,525 --> 00:37:07,324
Oh.

894
00:37:07,426 --> 00:37:09,025
Well, I wanted to go to town.

895
00:37:09,127 --> 00:37:11,261
I wanted to get the
decorations for the party.

896
00:37:11,363 --> 00:37:12,629
Well, why not go
in on the train?

897
00:37:12,731 --> 00:37:14,397
I'll tell you, we'll
take the kids, see a show

898
00:37:14,499 --> 00:37:15,599
and have dinner.

899
00:37:15,701 --> 00:37:17,534
No, I don't want her
to know what I'm getting.

900
00:37:17,636 --> 00:37:21,671
Oh, I see.

901
00:37:21,773 --> 00:37:23,740
I guess I could show you
a better time without her.

902
00:37:23,842 --> 00:37:24,708
Ed!

903
00:37:30,382 --> 00:37:31,414
How long will you be?

904
00:37:31,516 --> 00:37:32,682
I gotta run down to the corner.

905
00:37:32,784 --> 00:37:33,917
I won't be long.

906
00:37:34,019 --> 00:37:34,884
Well, unless you've
got a drink here.

907
00:37:34,987 --> 00:37:36,953
I've got sarsaparilla.

908
00:37:37,055 --> 00:37:40,190
I'll meet you at the corner.

909
00:37:44,263 --> 00:37:46,396
Sarsaparilla.

910
00:37:46,498 --> 00:37:49,232
Honest, Stel, some of
the things I do for you.

911
00:37:49,334 --> 00:37:50,800
You'll like it when
you get used to it.

912
00:37:50,902 --> 00:37:52,402
And it's good for you, too.

913
00:37:58,043 --> 00:37:58,975
What's that?

914
00:37:59,077 --> 00:38:00,210
Well, you can read, can't you?

915
00:38:00,312 --> 00:38:01,044
Itch powder?

916
00:38:01,146 --> 00:38:02,112
Shh!

917
00:38:05,851 --> 00:38:09,085
Things are just a little
too quiet around here.

918
00:38:09,187 --> 00:38:09,953
Oh, Ed, you're not--

919
00:38:10,055 --> 00:38:11,421
Hey, can I see that?

920
00:38:11,523 --> 00:38:13,323
Great jumpin' catfish, what's
the name of that horse?

921
00:38:13,425 --> 00:38:14,858
- What's the matter?
- Nothing's the matter.

922
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,026
I got a ticket on it.
Oh, ho!

923
00:38:16,128 --> 00:38:18,528
Kokomo wins!

924
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:19,362
I'm rich!

925
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:21,231
Well, let me shake your hand.

926
00:38:21,333 --> 00:38:22,599
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

927
00:38:22,701 --> 00:38:23,667
Congratulations!

928
00:38:23,769 --> 00:38:24,634
Thank you.

929
00:38:24,736 --> 00:38:25,769
I'm awfully glad.

930
00:38:25,871 --> 00:38:26,970
Why, listen, I stand to
win $20,000 or $30,000.

931
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:27,837
- Good.
- No fooling.

932
00:38:27,939 --> 00:38:29,005
What's the matter?

933
00:38:29,107 --> 00:38:30,473
Have a cigar.

934
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:33,009
Oh, what happened?

935
00:38:33,111 --> 00:38:33,910
Have a cigar.

936
00:38:34,012 --> 00:38:35,111
Sir!

937
00:38:35,213 --> 00:38:36,146
Oh, I beg your
pardon, you want gum.

938
00:38:36,248 --> 00:38:37,013
Here, we got all parts here.

939
00:38:37,115 --> 00:38:37,814
Thank you very much.

940
00:38:37,916 --> 00:38:38,948
Thank you, lady.

941
00:38:39,051 --> 00:38:40,116
Say, that was great luck.

942
00:38:40,218 --> 00:38:41,418
Why, did you
see what happened?

943
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,419
Yeah!

944
00:38:42,521 --> 00:38:44,521
He won $30,000
on a horse race!

945
00:38:44,623 --> 00:38:45,822
You're kidding.

946
00:38:45,924 --> 00:38:46,856
Really?

947
00:38:46,958 --> 00:38:48,425
Watch 'em commence.

948
00:38:57,235 --> 00:38:58,735
I can't stand it!

949
00:39:05,177 --> 00:39:06,676
Another one of 'em
just bit the dust.

950
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:09,646
Stop, you're killing me!

951
00:39:16,955 --> 00:39:18,521
Look at the old girls.

952
00:39:18,623 --> 00:39:20,924
They're doing a sister act.

953
00:39:21,026 --> 00:39:22,125
They must have rehearsed.

954
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:30,433
Hey, Stella.

955
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:31,101
Stella!

956
00:39:31,203 --> 00:39:33,203
What's so funny?

957
00:39:46,785 --> 00:39:47,751
Oh, come on, look.

958
00:39:47,853 --> 00:39:48,618
There are two down there.

959
00:39:51,289 --> 00:39:52,589
Gee, Ed, you're a card.

960
00:39:52,691 --> 00:39:54,724
I don't see how you can
keep such a straight face.

961
00:39:54,826 --> 00:39:57,627
Oh, well, what's a little
kidding among friends?

962
00:39:57,729 --> 00:39:59,095
- He's that the father?
- No.

963
00:39:59,197 --> 00:40:00,497
No, it can't be.

964
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:03,032
She particularly said her
husband was in New York.

965
00:40:05,837 --> 00:40:08,872
Such women don't
deserve to have children.

966
00:40:08,974 --> 00:40:10,907
Well, there's only one
way to drink sarsaparilla,

967
00:40:11,009 --> 00:40:13,176
and that's so it don't
taste like sarsaparilla.

968
00:40:13,278 --> 00:40:14,077
Do you mind?

969
00:40:14,179 --> 00:40:14,911
No.

970
00:40:15,013 --> 00:40:15,745
Want some?

971
00:40:15,847 --> 00:40:16,579
Uh-uh.

972
00:40:16,681 --> 00:40:18,915
Laurel's such a lovely child.

973
00:40:19,017 --> 00:40:20,216
I don't know what to think.

974
00:40:20,318 --> 00:40:22,852
Why, Mary Ann's been
asked to her party.

975
00:40:26,158 --> 00:40:27,924
Ah, Stel.

976
00:40:28,026 --> 00:40:29,592
Why don't you scratch
that first entry of yours

977
00:40:29,694 --> 00:40:31,461
and give somebody else a chance?

978
00:40:31,563 --> 00:40:32,729
Honest, I'd do anything for you.

979
00:40:32,831 --> 00:40:34,063
Please don't, Ed.

980
00:40:34,166 --> 00:40:35,732
It's like I told you.

981
00:40:35,834 --> 00:40:39,068
It's not personal,
only, well, I don't

982
00:40:39,171 --> 00:40:42,705
think there's a man living that
could get me going anymore.

983
00:40:42,808 --> 00:40:45,842
Oh, I don't know, I
guess Lolly just uses up

984
00:40:45,944 --> 00:40:48,878
all the feelings I've got
and I don't seem to have

985
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:52,048
any left for anybody else.

986
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:54,017
You got plenty for me, Stel.

987
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:56,352
Why can't we go on as we are?

988
00:40:56,455 --> 00:40:58,021
Gosh, I don't know
what I'd have done

989
00:40:58,123 --> 00:40:59,289
without you some
of the times when

990
00:40:59,391 --> 00:41:01,491
Lolly was back with Stephen.

991
00:41:01,593 --> 00:41:05,261
You're such a good sport
and such a lot of fun.

992
00:41:05,363 --> 00:41:07,430
Well, I guess you
know what you're doing.

993
00:41:10,068 --> 00:41:11,868
What's the matter?

994
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:13,102
Say, do you know what?

995
00:41:13,205 --> 00:41:14,237
I think I got some
of that stuff on me.

996
00:41:14,339 --> 00:41:15,271
Now, would that be a hit?
I have!

997
00:41:15,373 --> 00:41:16,172
Oh!

998
00:41:16,274 --> 00:41:18,007
Oh, Stel, it's all over.

999
00:41:18,109 --> 00:41:18,975
Here.

1000
00:41:27,719 --> 00:41:29,285
Gladys, You nearly ready?

1001
00:41:29,387 --> 00:41:30,653
I'll just have to let her in.

1002
00:41:30,755 --> 00:41:31,688
I'm ready.

1003
00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:32,322
Mm-mm!

1004
00:41:32,424 --> 00:41:33,223
Mrs. Dallas!

1005
00:41:33,325 --> 00:41:34,491
Do I look all right?

1006
00:41:34,593 --> 00:41:36,025
You know, none of
them have ever seen me

1007
00:41:36,127 --> 00:41:38,027
and she's always telling all
of them how beautiful I am.

1008
00:41:38,129 --> 00:41:39,596
Honey, you sure
can live up to it.

1009
00:41:39,698 --> 00:41:41,130
Yeah, but if I live
through this day,

1010
00:41:41,233 --> 00:41:42,332
I'm going to get
me another corset.

1011
00:41:42,434 --> 00:41:43,633
Mother?
- Yeah, coming, dear.

1012
00:41:53,078 --> 00:41:55,945
Mother!

1013
00:41:56,047 --> 00:41:57,547
However did you do it?

1014
00:42:00,418 --> 00:42:02,886
Oh, and you, Mother.

1015
00:42:02,988 --> 00:42:06,623
You look beautiful!

1016
00:42:06,725 --> 00:42:07,457
Do I?

1017
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:13,429
And look, favors!

1018
00:42:13,532 --> 00:42:14,931
Oh, now, don't
pull them, they pop

1019
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:17,033
and have little hats inside.

1020
00:42:17,135 --> 00:42:18,268
And the little baskets!

1021
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:19,969
And I put candies
in with the nuts.

1022
00:42:20,071 --> 00:42:22,338
And the placecards,
Mother, they're beautiful.

1023
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,573
Where did you get them?

1024
00:42:23,675 --> 00:42:27,143
Oh, I sit there
and you sit here.

1025
00:42:27,245 --> 00:42:28,378
And Miss Phillibrown
next to me,

1026
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,647
and Flo Bell, and Alice May.

1027
00:42:30,749 --> 00:42:33,283
Uh-huh.

1028
00:42:33,385 --> 00:42:34,617
Mother?

1029
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:38,087
Mother, could I see the cake?

1030
00:42:38,189 --> 00:42:42,225
Oh, all right, go ahead.

1031
00:42:42,327 --> 00:42:44,427
Oh, look!

1032
00:42:44,529 --> 00:42:47,263
One, two, three,
four, five, six--

1033
00:42:48,233 --> 00:42:49,599
Here somebody is!

1034
00:42:49,701 --> 00:42:50,266
Lolly!

1035
00:42:50,368 --> 00:42:52,235
Lolly!

1036
00:42:52,337 --> 00:42:53,336
Lolly, let Gladys go.

1037
00:42:53,438 --> 00:42:54,170
All right.

1038
00:42:54,272 --> 00:42:55,204
Gladys.

1039
00:42:55,307 --> 00:42:56,806
Now remember what I told you.

1040
00:42:56,908 --> 00:42:59,175
Yeah.

1041
00:42:59,277 --> 00:43:01,444
Lolly, no, no.

1042
00:43:01,546 --> 00:43:02,745
Is this the
Dallas residence?

1043
00:43:02,847 --> 00:43:03,546
Yes.

1044
00:43:03,648 --> 00:43:05,882
Sign here, please.

1045
00:43:05,984 --> 00:43:06,516
Thank you.

1046
00:43:06,618 --> 00:43:07,483
Thank you.

1047
00:43:11,289 --> 00:43:12,722
It's for you, Lolly.

1048
00:43:12,824 --> 00:43:14,490
Don't you forget to say Miss
Laurel in front of people.

1049
00:43:14,593 --> 00:43:15,458
Yes, ma'am.

1050
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:17,427
What is it?

1051
00:43:17,529 --> 00:43:18,461
It's from Miss Phillibrown.

1052
00:43:18,563 --> 00:43:19,696
She can't come.

1053
00:43:19,798 --> 00:43:21,431
Well, what does she say?

1054
00:43:21,533 --> 00:43:23,700
"Laurel, dear, I'm sorry
it is impossible for me

1055
00:43:23,802 --> 00:43:26,402
to come to your party, but I'm
thinking of you this afternoon

1056
00:43:26,504 --> 00:43:29,439
and I hope you will
not be disappointed.

1057
00:43:29,541 --> 00:43:31,441
Sincerely, your friend
Margaret Phillibrown."

1058
00:43:31,543 --> 00:43:33,743
Oh, that's too bad.

1059
00:43:33,845 --> 00:43:35,478
Oh, I do you
wish she could have

1060
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:37,880
come just to see everything.

1061
00:43:37,983 --> 00:43:39,015
And you.

1062
00:43:39,117 --> 00:43:43,186
Oh, well, I'll fix up
again for her sometime.

1063
00:43:43,288 --> 00:43:45,321
Most likely the girls will
have a better time without her.

1064
00:43:45,423 --> 00:43:47,357
I guess they see enough
of her in school.

1065
00:43:47,459 --> 00:43:48,825
I know I did my teachers.

1066
00:43:48,927 --> 00:43:50,493
Oh, but everyone
loves Miss Phillibrown.

1067
00:43:50,595 --> 00:43:53,429
Gladys, take these, please.

1068
00:43:53,531 --> 00:43:57,333
Well, anyway, it'll
make an even number.

1069
00:43:57,435 --> 00:43:59,569
Sure!

1070
00:43:59,671 --> 00:44:01,971
Come on, we'll wait
in the other room.

1071
00:44:02,073 --> 00:44:03,539
You sit over there.

1072
00:44:13,918 --> 00:44:14,584
No!

1073
00:44:14,686 --> 00:44:16,753
No, let Gladys go.

1074
00:44:16,855 --> 00:44:17,654
Remember what I told you?

1075
00:44:17,756 --> 00:44:18,521
Miss Dallas' residence?

1076
00:44:18,623 --> 00:44:19,689
That's right.

1077
00:44:21,926 --> 00:44:25,528
Miss Dallas' residence.

1078
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:27,797
OK, I'll tell her.

1079
00:44:27,899 --> 00:44:29,098
Who was it?

1080
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,067
It was Miss Cheeny and she
says Alice May can't come.

1081
00:44:31,169 --> 00:44:31,901
Who?

1082
00:44:34,739 --> 00:44:36,205
Alice May Cheeny.

1083
00:44:36,307 --> 00:44:37,807
She sits next to me in school.

1084
00:44:40,845 --> 00:44:41,611
Oh.

1085
00:44:47,452 --> 00:44:49,118
Uh, it'll make the
table look better.

1086
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:51,020
It won't be so crowded.

1087
00:44:54,025 --> 00:44:55,124
I'll fix it.

1088
00:45:33,832 --> 00:45:35,298
I think I better make
some more biscuits,

1089
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:36,365
don't you, Miss Dallas?

1090
00:45:36,468 --> 00:45:38,367
The others is all dried up.

1091
00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:39,302
Yes.

1092
00:45:39,404 --> 00:45:40,369
Yes, let's do that.

1093
00:45:40,472 --> 00:45:41,738
That's a very good idea.

1094
00:45:44,776 --> 00:45:48,010
You know, Mother, they're
not coming or they'd be here.

1095
00:45:48,113 --> 00:45:52,248
Oh, Lolly, you
don't think that--

1096
00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:53,850
We'll go in together.

1097
00:46:39,597 --> 00:46:42,732
I never know what to look for,
you change so much each time.

1098
00:46:42,834 --> 00:46:43,833
Do I look older?

1099
00:46:43,935 --> 00:46:44,467
Older?

1100
00:46:44,569 --> 00:46:46,502
You're a young lady.

1101
00:46:46,604 --> 00:46:48,437
Evidently your
wardrobe's going up, too.

1102
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:50,206
Oh, I have a costume
for everything.

1103
00:46:50,308 --> 00:46:51,440
Fine.

1104
00:46:51,543 --> 00:46:52,775
Because we have a
wonderful invitation

1105
00:46:52,877 --> 00:46:54,710
to spend our whole time
together in the most

1106
00:46:54,813 --> 00:46:55,778
beautiful place in the world.

1107
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:57,013
- Better than Maine?
- Mm-hm.

1108
00:46:57,115 --> 00:46:57,847
Where?

1109
00:46:57,949 --> 00:46:58,948
Mm-hm.

1110
00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:01,384
You'll see.

1111
00:47:01,486 --> 00:47:02,718
Hello.

1112
00:47:02,821 --> 00:47:04,587
Martha, this
is my daughter, Laurel.

1113
00:47:04,689 --> 00:47:06,923
How do you do?

1114
00:47:07,025 --> 00:47:12,995
Oh, Daddy, it's so beautiful.

1115
00:47:13,097 --> 00:47:13,830
Hello, Laurel.

1116
00:47:13,932 --> 00:47:15,131
This is Mrs. Morrison, Laurel.

1117
00:47:15,233 --> 00:47:15,765
How do you do?

1118
00:47:15,867 --> 00:47:16,766
So glad to see you.

1119
00:47:16,868 --> 00:47:19,669
I'm so glad to see you, too.

1120
00:47:19,771 --> 00:47:21,237
Michael, this is Laurel.

1121
00:47:21,339 --> 00:47:23,406
We've been waiting
and waiting to meet.

1122
00:47:24,909 --> 00:47:26,809
Now, don't overdo it.

1123
00:47:26,911 --> 00:47:29,212
Oh, he's such a nice dog.

1124
00:47:29,314 --> 00:47:30,613
Where are the boys?

1125
00:47:30,715 --> 00:47:32,548
I believe they're still down
at the stables, Mrs. Morrison.

1126
00:47:32,650 --> 00:47:33,950
Ah, well, tell them
their surprise is here.

1127
00:47:34,052 --> 00:47:35,885
You don't mind being
a surprise, do you?

1128
00:47:35,987 --> 00:47:36,853
No.

1129
00:47:36,955 --> 00:47:38,020
Come on, Mike,
we'll go fetch 'em.

1130
00:47:38,122 --> 00:47:38,821
Come on, boy.

1131
00:47:38,923 --> 00:47:42,258
I'll show Laurel her room.

1132
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:43,092
Oh.

1133
00:47:48,166 --> 00:47:49,065
It's lovely.

1134
00:47:59,143 --> 00:48:00,009
How sweet.

1135
00:48:02,947 --> 00:48:04,480
Now, if you let
me have your keys,

1136
00:48:04,582 --> 00:48:06,349
I'll have Martha unpack you.

1137
00:48:06,451 --> 00:48:07,350
Oh, I can do it.

1138
00:48:13,892 --> 00:48:15,658
I'll take your coat.

1139
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:16,993
Yes, thank you.

1140
00:48:20,231 --> 00:48:21,130
And your hat?

1141
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:31,507
Oh, everything!

1142
00:48:31,609 --> 00:48:33,876
Oh, I like nice closets, too.

1143
00:48:33,978 --> 00:48:35,311
We'll hang this here.

1144
00:48:41,452 --> 00:48:42,184
There.

1145
00:48:47,959 --> 00:48:50,493
Oh, I'm so glad you
brought your riding clothes.

1146
00:48:50,595 --> 00:48:53,296
It was one of the things on my
list, to ride in Central Park.

1147
00:48:53,398 --> 00:48:57,033
Well, we'll be
using them here, too.

1148
00:48:57,135 --> 00:48:59,568
Oh, and so many
pretty dresses.

1149
00:48:59,671 --> 00:49:02,605
What fun your mother must
have choosing them for you.

1150
00:49:02,707 --> 00:49:04,707
She makes them all.

1151
00:49:04,809 --> 00:49:05,541
She does?

1152
00:49:05,643 --> 00:49:06,509
Uh-huh.

1153
00:49:06,611 --> 00:49:08,611
Oh, how clever!

1154
00:49:08,713 --> 00:49:10,613
Oh, what a lucky girl you are.

1155
00:49:10,715 --> 00:49:12,548
And how lucky she is, too.

1156
00:49:12,650 --> 00:49:15,351
All boys want to
wear are overalls.

1157
00:49:16,754 --> 00:49:18,421
Ah, well, I suppose
you want to freshen up.

1158
00:49:18,523 --> 00:49:20,589
But don't change.

1159
00:49:20,692 --> 00:49:23,392
I'll run down and see that your
father has his tea, because he

1160
00:49:23,494 --> 00:49:25,795
has to get right back to town.

1161
00:49:25,897 --> 00:49:27,563
You come down when
you're ready, and don't

1162
00:49:27,665 --> 00:49:28,864
keep the boys waiting too long.

1163
00:49:28,967 --> 00:49:32,234
Thank you.

1164
00:49:32,337 --> 00:49:35,371
PARTY MUSIC,
INDISTINCT CONVERSATION

1165
00:49:53,992 --> 00:49:55,925
They won't acknowledge
that they like you yet, they

1166
00:49:56,027 --> 00:49:57,259
haven't got as far as that.

1167
00:49:57,362 --> 00:49:59,996
But have you noticed the
hair brushing and collar

1168
00:50:00,098 --> 00:50:01,163
wearing that's been going on?

1169
00:50:01,899 --> 00:50:03,799
I have.

1170
00:50:03,901 --> 00:50:05,768
Mother!

1171
00:50:05,870 --> 00:50:08,204
Am I too little to
dance with Laurel?

1172
00:50:08,306 --> 00:50:08,904
Did she say so?

1173
00:50:09,007 --> 00:50:11,340
No, but Con did.

1174
00:50:11,442 --> 00:50:13,642
Well, if I wanted
to dance with Laurel,

1175
00:50:13,745 --> 00:50:16,579
I think I'd ask her, not Con.

1176
00:50:16,681 --> 00:50:19,215
I will.

1177
00:50:19,317 --> 00:50:19,849
Big intrigue.

1178
00:50:23,454 --> 00:50:24,720
Let me have it.

1179
00:50:24,822 --> 00:50:25,688
You'll drop it.

1180
00:50:25,790 --> 00:50:28,624
I will not.

1181
00:50:28,726 --> 00:50:29,592
I'm carrying it.

1182
00:50:29,694 --> 00:50:31,327
I want to carry it.

1183
00:50:31,429 --> 00:50:33,162
Goodbye, Laurel.
It's been fun, hasn't it?

1184
00:50:33,264 --> 00:50:34,196
Oh, yes.

1185
00:50:34,298 --> 00:50:35,731
Oh, we look forward
to the next time.

1186
00:50:35,833 --> 00:50:39,035
I've had such a lovely time,
I don't know how to thank you.

1187
00:50:56,354 --> 00:50:57,253
Bye!

1188
00:50:57,355 --> 00:50:58,254
Goodbye!

1189
00:50:58,356 --> 00:51:00,623
Goodbye!

1190
00:51:00,725 --> 00:51:03,592
Oh, aren't they the nicest boys?

1191
00:51:03,694 --> 00:51:04,760
I think so.

1192
00:51:04,862 --> 00:51:06,495
How did you like Mrs. Morrison?

1193
00:51:06,597 --> 00:51:09,331
I think she's the
loveliest lady I ever knew.

1194
00:51:09,434 --> 00:51:10,299
Do you, Laurel?

1195
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:10,933
Do you really?

1196
00:51:11,035 --> 00:51:12,401
Oh, I mean--

1197
00:51:12,503 --> 00:51:16,338
I mean-- of course, I
mean except my mother.

1198
00:51:20,411 --> 00:51:22,311
Mother, how nice!

1199
00:51:23,781 --> 00:51:25,714
It's a little stuffy,
I'm going to open a window!

1200
00:51:25,817 --> 00:51:27,683
All right.

1201
00:51:31,522 --> 00:51:32,254
You happy?

1202
00:51:32,356 --> 00:51:33,556
Mm.

1203
00:51:33,658 --> 00:51:34,857
Well, I guess I'll shove off.

1204
00:51:34,959 --> 00:51:36,892
You two got lots to
talk about, and-- say,

1205
00:51:36,994 --> 00:51:38,160
where are you going to eat, Ed?

1206
00:51:38,262 --> 00:51:39,195
Me?

1207
00:51:39,297 --> 00:51:40,362
Oh, I don't know, I
ain't very hungry.

1208
00:51:40,465 --> 00:51:42,164
I thought maybe I'd
stop in at, uh--

1209
00:51:42,266 --> 00:51:45,601
Well, uh, why don't you come
back and have dinner with us?

1210
00:51:45,703 --> 00:51:46,802
You only bought two chops.

1211
00:51:46,904 --> 00:51:47,870
Sure, one for you
and one for Lolly.

1212
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,640
Oh, say, I'm so happy I
couldn't even look at a meal.

1213
00:51:51,742 --> 00:51:52,842
Fine.
About what time?

1214
00:51:52,944 --> 00:51:53,676
Oh, an hour.

1215
00:51:53,778 --> 00:51:54,510
Good.

1216
00:51:54,612 --> 00:51:55,911
So long, Lollipops.

1217
00:51:56,013 --> 00:51:59,148
I'll come back and tie
on the nose bag with you.

1218
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:00,449
Want me to bring anything?

1219
00:52:00,551 --> 00:52:01,317
No.

1220
00:52:01,419 --> 00:52:02,251
No thanks, Ed.

1221
00:52:05,957 --> 00:52:07,389
Oh, Mother, why did you?

1222
00:52:07,492 --> 00:52:09,458
I thought we were going to
have a nice, quiet time alone.

1223
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:13,796
Oh, so did I, Lolly, darling,
but things haven't been going

1224
00:52:13,898 --> 00:52:15,898
so good for poor Ed
lately, not that you

1225
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,433
never know it to hear him talk.

1226
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:21,237
But you remember that bit watch
and chain he used to wear?

1227
00:52:21,339 --> 00:52:24,573
Well, they're-- they're
just not there anymore.

1228
00:52:24,675 --> 00:52:25,441
I'm sorry.

1229
00:52:28,579 --> 00:52:29,812
Gladys!

1230
00:52:29,914 --> 00:52:31,347
Oh, she's not here anymore.

1231
00:52:31,449 --> 00:52:32,181
I let her go.

1232
00:52:32,283 --> 00:52:33,382
Mother!

1233
00:52:33,484 --> 00:52:36,218
Oh, well, what did I
need with anybody around?

1234
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:38,187
Oh Mother, you shouldn't have.

1235
00:52:38,289 --> 00:52:40,022
Besides, I was glad
to have something to do

1236
00:52:40,124 --> 00:52:42,958
to help pass the time away.

1237
00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:43,826
You know what I did?

1238
00:52:43,928 --> 00:52:45,027
What?

1239
00:52:45,129 --> 00:52:46,295
I saved enough
money out of her wages

1240
00:52:46,397 --> 00:52:49,965
to pay a deposit on
a fur coat for you.

1241
00:52:50,067 --> 00:52:51,367
Mother, you didn't.

1242
00:52:51,469 --> 00:52:52,568
Mm-hm.

1243
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:55,004
Well, you're just going
to get it right back.

1244
00:52:55,106 --> 00:52:56,639
I don't want a fur
coat now, Mother.

1245
00:52:56,741 --> 00:52:59,141
Besides, none of the girls I
met at Mrs. Morrison's were

1246
00:52:59,243 --> 00:53:00,276
allowed to have them yet.

1247
00:53:00,378 --> 00:53:00,910
Oh no?

1248
00:53:01,012 --> 00:53:02,745
No.

1249
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:05,214
Oh.

1250
00:53:05,316 --> 00:53:07,650
Here.

1251
00:53:07,752 --> 00:53:12,354
Mother, you know what
I've been thinking?

1252
00:53:12,456 --> 00:53:13,923
Would it cost too
awfully much for us

1253
00:53:14,025 --> 00:53:16,158
to have a house with
our own front door,

1254
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:19,428
and a little garden and flowers
and a room for each of us?

1255
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:21,263
Oh, just in case
sometimes we wanted

1256
00:53:21,365 --> 00:53:23,532
somebody to stay all night.

1257
00:53:23,634 --> 00:53:26,602
Oh, Mother, not a great
big expensive house

1258
00:53:26,704 --> 00:53:30,406
like Mrs. Morrison's, but
just a little, tiny place.

1259
00:53:30,508 --> 00:53:33,709
Say, tell me about
this Mrs. Morrison.

1260
00:53:33,811 --> 00:53:34,677
What's she like?

1261
00:53:34,779 --> 00:53:36,579
Oh, Mother, she's lovely.

1262
00:53:36,681 --> 00:53:43,152
She's sort of-- well, she
reminds me of a flower

1263
00:53:43,254 --> 00:53:45,254
that grows up in Maine.

1264
00:53:45,356 --> 00:53:49,024
All pale and delicate,
but strong, too.

1265
00:53:49,126 --> 00:53:50,559
I don't know what you call it.

1266
00:53:50,661 --> 00:53:52,962
Oh, gracious, Lolly, I don't
care what kind of a flower

1267
00:53:53,064 --> 00:53:54,363
she looks like!

1268
00:53:54,465 --> 00:53:57,733
Is she tall or short, dark
or light, fat or thin?

1269
00:53:57,835 --> 00:53:59,068
How old is she?

1270
00:53:59,170 --> 00:54:02,104
Well, she doesn't seem
to be any special age.

1271
00:54:02,206 --> 00:54:04,974
You know, she's like
one of those goddesses

1272
00:54:05,076 --> 00:54:07,176
in my mythology book that way.

1273
00:54:07,278 --> 00:54:08,978
Oh, come now.

1274
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:11,847
You can tell whether
she's 20 or 40.

1275
00:54:11,949 --> 00:54:14,516
Oh, she's not 40, no.

1276
00:54:14,619 --> 00:54:17,519
Well, I'd guess
maybe she's about 25.

1277
00:54:17,622 --> 00:54:21,724
And how did your father
happen to meet this goddess?

1278
00:54:21,826 --> 00:54:23,158
Mother, it's like a story.

1279
00:54:23,261 --> 00:54:24,460
Con told me all about it.
- Con?

1280
00:54:24,562 --> 00:54:25,160
Mm-hm.

1281
00:54:25,263 --> 00:54:26,862
Is that her husband?

1282
00:54:26,964 --> 00:54:28,063
Oh, no, he's dead.

1283
00:54:28,165 --> 00:54:29,465
Didn't I write you?

1284
00:54:29,567 --> 00:54:31,634
Dead, is he?

1285
00:54:31,736 --> 00:54:33,102
Well, that's convenient.

1286
00:54:33,204 --> 00:54:34,069
Oh no, it isn't.

1287
00:54:34,171 --> 00:54:35,671
It isn't a bit convenient.

1288
00:54:35,773 --> 00:54:38,741
Because when Mr. Morrison died,
he left a whole lot of houses

1289
00:54:38,843 --> 00:54:41,977
and horses and money and things,
and Mrs. Morrison has to look

1290
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:44,313
out for them all by herself.

1291
00:54:44,415 --> 00:54:47,449
You know, she said she wouldn't
know what to do without Father

1292
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:49,351
to help her and advise her.

1293
00:54:49,453 --> 00:54:51,020
Yeah.

1294
00:54:51,122 --> 00:54:53,656
I can just imagine.

1295
00:54:53,758 --> 00:54:54,790
Oh, I just remembered.

1296
00:54:54,892 --> 00:54:55,924
I've got some snapshots of her.

1297
00:54:56,027 --> 00:54:57,993
Aw, no, Lolly, I--

1298
00:54:58,095 --> 00:54:59,528
I just want to look at you.

1299
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:00,996
Oh, but Mother, I want you
to see her, she's beautiful.

1300
00:55:01,098 --> 00:55:01,997
No--

1301
00:55:02,099 --> 00:55:03,432
You'll be crazy about her!

1302
00:55:09,006 --> 00:55:11,140
The funny thing about her
is she's not only beautiful

1303
00:55:11,242 --> 00:55:12,408
when she's all
dressed, but even when

1304
00:55:12,510 --> 00:55:14,176
she wakes up in the morning.

1305
00:55:14,278 --> 00:55:16,412
She spends hardly
any time on her face.

1306
00:55:16,514 --> 00:55:18,881
Once I saw her put soap
and water right on it.

1307
00:55:18,983 --> 00:55:22,184
Well, all I can say is there
are different kinds of skin.

1308
00:55:22,286 --> 00:55:23,519
And besides, with
her money, she don't

1309
00:55:23,621 --> 00:55:26,355
have to worry about her looks.

1310
00:55:26,457 --> 00:55:30,192
Say, are those real pearls
she's got slung around her neck?

1311
00:55:30,294 --> 00:55:31,593
Mother, look
what you're doing!

1312
00:55:31,696 --> 00:55:32,795
What?

1313
00:55:32,897 --> 00:55:34,029
You're getting cold
cream all over her picture!

1314
00:55:34,131 --> 00:55:35,097
Oh, I didn't mean it, Lolly.

1315
00:55:35,199 --> 00:55:35,931
Oh, give it to me!

1316
00:55:36,033 --> 00:55:36,965
I'm sorry!

1317
00:55:55,586 --> 00:55:56,485
I'll do it.

1318
00:56:22,813 --> 00:56:24,246
Oh,
jingle bells, jingle bells.

1319
00:56:25,316 --> 00:56:27,082
Jingle all the--

1320
00:56:32,456 --> 00:56:36,258
Hello, Lollipops!

1321
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:37,993
Merry Christmas.

1322
00:56:38,095 --> 00:56:38,994
Merry Christmas.

1323
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:45,134
Here
is your mistletoe,

1324
00:56:45,236 --> 00:56:46,869
now where's the kiss?

1325
00:56:46,971 --> 00:56:47,770
Where's the kish?

1326
00:56:47,872 --> 00:56:48,604
Mother!

1327
00:56:48,706 --> 00:56:50,439
Ed!

1328
00:56:50,541 --> 00:56:51,540
Stella!

1329
00:56:51,642 --> 00:56:53,175
Go on, run along, go inside.

1330
00:56:53,277 --> 00:56:54,443
No, no, no, no.

1331
00:56:54,545 --> 00:56:55,878
Ed Munn, what do
you mean by showing up

1332
00:56:55,980 --> 00:56:57,479
around here in this condition?
You get out of here!

1333
00:56:57,581 --> 00:56:59,448
Shh, Stella, Stella,
I got something for you.

1334
00:57:08,259 --> 00:57:09,725
I-- I've been robbed.

1335
00:57:09,827 --> 00:57:12,027
Why, if I thought that
anybody would take--

1336
00:57:12,129 --> 00:57:14,663
Oh.

1337
00:57:14,765 --> 00:57:15,497
Oh!

1338
00:57:17,635 --> 00:57:21,036
Here you are, my dear, and
a very Merry Christmas.

1339
00:57:21,138 --> 00:57:22,404
No thanks, Ed.
I can't take it.

1340
00:57:22,506 --> 00:57:23,772
I wouldn't know
what to do with it.

1341
00:57:23,874 --> 00:57:24,873
Huh?
Oh.

1342
00:57:24,975 --> 00:57:26,208
What to do with it.

1343
00:57:26,310 --> 00:57:29,044
Cook it!

1344
00:57:29,146 --> 00:57:30,012
No, you run along.

1345
00:57:30,114 --> 00:57:31,346
Give it to somebody else.

1346
00:57:31,449 --> 00:57:32,381
What, me give my
chicken to somebody else?

1347
00:57:32,483 --> 00:57:33,916
You think I'm going to do that?

1348
00:57:34,018 --> 00:57:35,083
I'm gonna take it, I'm gonna
stick it, I'm gonna take it

1349
00:57:35,186 --> 00:57:36,218
and I'm gonna put it in--

1350
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:38,787
Ed Munn, you
come out of there!

1351
00:57:45,196 --> 00:57:46,495
Ed!

1352
00:57:46,597 --> 00:57:48,530
What are you trying to
do, set the place on fire?

1353
00:57:48,632 --> 00:57:49,531
No.

1354
00:57:49,633 --> 00:57:52,901
Well, you're, uh--
cookin' a turkey.

1355
00:57:53,838 --> 00:57:56,205
Ed!

1356
00:57:56,307 --> 00:57:58,073
Get that thing out of here.

1357
00:57:58,175 --> 00:57:59,208
I say no.

1358
00:58:00,377 --> 00:58:01,844
I say yes.

1359
00:58:01,946 --> 00:58:03,345
Now, Stella, listen, don't
tell me how to cook a turkey.

1360
00:58:03,447 --> 00:58:04,880
I know how to cook a turkey.

1361
00:58:04,982 --> 00:58:05,814
Oh, Ed, no.

1362
00:58:05,916 --> 00:58:06,982
Now, come on.

1363
00:58:07,084 --> 00:58:07,816
Stel!

1364
00:58:07,918 --> 00:58:08,817
Stel, no!

1365
00:58:08,919 --> 00:58:10,052
Now, listen.

1366
00:58:10,154 --> 00:58:11,687
I know how the curkey should
be tooked, and so there.

1367
00:58:11,789 --> 00:58:14,890
Now, of course the feet
won't be very well done,

1368
00:58:14,992 --> 00:58:16,625
but then I don't care
for feet much anyway.

1369
00:58:16,727 --> 00:58:18,861
Oh, Ed, now, be reasonable.

1370
00:58:23,267 --> 00:58:23,999
Merry Christmas.

1371
00:58:24,101 --> 00:58:26,268
Father!

1372
00:58:26,370 --> 00:58:28,237
Oh, I'm so glad to see you!

1373
00:58:28,339 --> 00:58:30,539
Oh, and am I glad to see you.

1374
00:58:31,375 --> 00:58:34,443
What a nice surprise.

1375
00:58:34,545 --> 00:58:36,478
You should see the way I've
been running to the door.

1376
00:58:36,580 --> 00:58:38,413
I never dreamed of
anything so wonderful

1377
00:58:38,516 --> 00:58:40,449
as your bringing them yourself.

1378
00:58:40,551 --> 00:58:43,218
Ooh, what a lovely tree!

1379
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:44,520
Here you are.

1380
00:58:44,622 --> 00:58:46,188
Oh, thank you, Daddy.

1381
00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:50,359
I'll put them right here
while I go call Mother.

1382
00:58:50,461 --> 00:58:51,860
I'll take your coat and hat.

1383
00:58:54,832 --> 00:58:57,232
This
is a fine Christmas spirit,

1384
00:58:57,334 --> 00:58:58,867
that you don't have
anything in the house.

1385
00:58:58,969 --> 00:58:59,968
Ha!

1386
00:59:00,070 --> 00:59:02,037
Strawberry, now, there
you are, strawberry.

1387
00:59:02,139 --> 00:59:03,005
And lemon.

1388
00:59:03,107 --> 00:59:03,839
Ha!

1389
00:59:03,941 --> 00:59:05,674
Lemon and peach.

1390
00:59:05,776 --> 00:59:06,575
Ho, ho, ho!

1391
00:59:07,845 --> 00:59:08,577
What is this?

1392
00:59:08,679 --> 00:59:10,612
Ohh, this is more sarsaparilla.

1393
00:59:10,714 --> 00:59:12,414
Well, of all the
places I ever saw

1394
00:59:12,516 --> 00:59:13,815
where a man can't have any--

1395
00:59:13,918 --> 00:59:15,417
You go
inside and keep him company,

1396
00:59:15,519 --> 00:59:16,952
and I'll get dressed and
come in as fast as I can.

1397
00:59:17,054 --> 00:59:18,887
All right.

1398
00:59:18,989 --> 00:59:20,289
Hey, Stel!

1399
00:59:20,391 --> 00:59:22,090
What is all the
whispering over there?

1400
00:59:22,192 --> 00:59:23,225
You've got to go.

1401
00:59:23,327 --> 00:59:24,359
I've got company.
- Oh, company?

1402
00:59:24,461 --> 00:59:25,427
- Yes, come on.
- Having company?

1403
00:59:25,529 --> 00:59:26,461
Who's the company?

1404
00:59:26,564 --> 00:59:27,663
Never you mind, you just go.

1405
00:59:27,765 --> 00:59:28,664
Well, I'd like to
see the company--

1406
00:59:28,766 --> 00:59:30,499
No-- Ed!

1407
00:59:30,601 --> 00:59:31,433
Oh, Stella, now, listen.

1408
00:59:31,535 --> 00:59:32,434
Come on.

1409
00:59:32,536 --> 00:59:33,769
Oh, I'll tell you, Stella.

1410
00:59:33,871 --> 00:59:35,270
No, sir, I'm going to
sit right here until I

1411
00:59:35,372 --> 00:59:36,238
find out who the company is.

1412
00:59:37,174 --> 00:59:38,507
Ed, shh!

1413
00:59:38,609 --> 00:59:40,208
No you're not, you're gonna go.

1414
00:59:40,311 --> 00:59:43,312
Pushin' and shovin'!

1415
00:59:45,649 --> 00:59:46,548
ED
I think the company

1416
00:59:46,650 --> 00:59:47,783
would like the turkey, too.

1417
00:59:47,885 --> 00:59:49,518
It was the biggest
turkey I could find.

1418
00:59:49,620 --> 00:59:51,920
One of the finest
turks that the man had.

1419
00:59:52,022 --> 00:59:56,224
I never saw such a big
turkey in all my life.

1420
00:59:56,327 --> 00:59:58,860
Daddy, a
wristwatch, how lovely!

1421
00:59:58,963 --> 01:00:00,195
Do you
like it, darling?

1422
01:00:00,297 --> 01:00:01,363
Oh, yes!

1423
01:00:01,465 --> 01:00:02,497
You're
getting so grown up,

1424
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:05,167
I hardly know what
to buy for you.

1425
01:01:11,301 --> 01:01:13,535
Mother copied it from one
we saw in the window of a shop

1426
01:01:13,637 --> 01:01:14,970
in Boston.

1427
01:01:15,072 --> 01:01:16,638
You can hardly tell
the difference.

1428
01:01:16,740 --> 01:01:19,908
It is pretty, isn't it?

1429
01:01:20,010 --> 01:01:21,510
It was my best
present till you came.

1430
01:01:21,612 --> 01:01:24,446
Oh, you darling.

1431
01:01:24,548 --> 01:01:26,014
Stephen?

1432
01:01:26,116 --> 01:01:28,350
Well!

1433
01:01:28,452 --> 01:01:29,584
Merry Christmas, Stella.

1434
01:01:29,687 --> 01:01:33,422
Merry Christmas
to you, Stephen.

1435
01:01:33,524 --> 01:01:34,723
It's good to see you again.

1436
01:01:34,825 --> 01:01:36,058
Well, it's good to see you.

1437
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:36,958
Sit down.

1438
01:01:37,061 --> 01:01:38,960
Thank you.

1439
01:01:39,063 --> 01:01:40,595
Place looks
awfully nice, Stella.

1440
01:01:40,698 --> 01:01:42,130
You'll go to dinner with us?

1441
01:01:42,232 --> 01:01:44,399
Well, darling, I--

1442
01:01:44,501 --> 01:01:46,868
I came to ask your
mother a favor.

1443
01:01:46,970 --> 01:01:51,273
Stella, I was wondering if
you'd let me have Laurel

1444
01:01:51,375 --> 01:01:52,974
for the holidays this time.

1445
01:01:53,077 --> 01:01:55,110
I've never had a
place for her before.

1446
01:01:55,212 --> 01:01:58,447
This time we have an invitation
to spend with the Morrisons.

1447
01:01:58,549 --> 01:02:01,383
Oh.

1448
01:02:01,485 --> 01:02:04,352
Well.

1449
01:02:04,455 --> 01:02:05,921
Would you like to go, Lolly?

1450
01:02:06,023 --> 01:02:07,289
Yes.

1451
01:02:07,391 --> 01:02:08,724
Oh, that is, if--

1452
01:02:08,826 --> 01:02:10,792
Oh, I-- I think
it would be lovely.

1453
01:02:14,832 --> 01:02:16,031
When would you
want her, Stephen?

1454
01:02:16,133 --> 01:02:18,567
Well, my train leaves
in an hour, Stella.

1455
01:02:18,669 --> 01:02:21,169
I was hoping I could
take her back with me.

1456
01:02:21,271 --> 01:02:22,304
Today?

1457
01:02:22,406 --> 01:02:23,338
Oh, no, no.

1458
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:24,673
Not today, I couldn't, Father.

1459
01:02:24,775 --> 01:02:27,576
Mother and I had
something all planned.

1460
01:02:27,678 --> 01:02:31,379
Well, yes, we did, but--

1461
01:02:31,482 --> 01:02:35,016
well, we-- we could
do that anytime.

1462
01:02:44,161 --> 01:02:46,394
All right, come on,
we'll have to hurry.

1463
01:02:46,497 --> 01:02:49,898
You have to have your new coat,
and you want these things.

1464
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,166
I'll just get her started.

1465
01:02:51,268 --> 01:02:52,067
Excuse us.

1466
01:02:52,169 --> 01:02:52,901
Hurry.

1467
01:02:55,506 --> 01:02:57,339
There's your case there.

1468
01:02:57,441 --> 01:02:58,473
Will this do for the train?

1469
01:02:58,575 --> 01:02:59,674
Yes, that's fine.

1470
01:02:59,777 --> 01:03:00,675
Just pack what you
need now, and I'll

1471
01:03:00,778 --> 01:03:01,543
send your trunk on tonight.

1472
01:03:01,645 --> 01:03:03,745
All right, Mother.

1473
01:03:03,847 --> 01:03:06,481
She won't be very long.

1474
01:03:06,583 --> 01:03:08,316
This is for you, Stella.

1475
01:03:08,418 --> 01:03:09,885
Oh, thank you.

1476
01:03:12,790 --> 01:03:16,057
Stella, I'm awfully sorry.

1477
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:19,394
When I see all you've done
here, and you did have plans,

1478
01:03:19,496 --> 01:03:20,529
I didn't realize--

1479
01:03:20,631 --> 01:03:22,063
Oh, it wasn't
anything, really.

1480
01:03:22,166 --> 01:03:25,667
We were just going to a show
and dinner at the Bontonne.

1481
01:03:25,769 --> 01:03:27,235
This will be a
real treat for her.

1482
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:33,241
It's been so long
since I've seen you.

1483
01:03:33,343 --> 01:03:34,609
How have you been?

1484
01:03:34,711 --> 01:03:35,544
Well, thank you.

1485
01:03:35,646 --> 01:03:37,479
And you?

1486
01:03:37,581 --> 01:03:38,446
Oh, fine.

1487
01:03:38,549 --> 01:03:40,182
That's good.

1488
01:03:40,284 --> 01:03:44,486
It's too bad your
train leaves so early.

1489
01:03:44,588 --> 01:03:46,488
Stella, I--

1490
01:03:46,590 --> 01:03:47,789
I've been thinking.

1491
01:03:47,891 --> 01:03:50,859
I don't know why didn't
occur to me before.

1492
01:03:50,961 --> 01:03:53,061
But there's no earthly reason in
the world why you should spend

1493
01:03:53,163 --> 01:03:55,297
the day all alone
just because I've

1494
01:03:55,399 --> 01:03:58,333
been selfish and thoughtless.

1495
01:03:58,435 --> 01:03:59,568
There must be a later train.

1496
01:03:59,670 --> 01:04:00,468
Where's the telephone?

1497
01:04:00,571 --> 01:04:03,004
Shall we call and see?

1498
01:04:03,106 --> 01:04:05,407
Oh, yes.

1499
01:04:05,509 --> 01:04:06,975
Please.

1500
01:04:07,077 --> 01:04:07,776
Here.

1501
01:04:17,821 --> 01:04:21,423
Beacon Hill 3700, please.

1502
01:04:22,659 --> 01:04:23,458
Ooh!

1503
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:24,893
Fooled you, didn't I?

1504
01:04:24,995 --> 01:04:26,761
You put me out the back
door and I went all the way

1505
01:04:26,864 --> 01:04:28,330
around and came right in here!

1506
01:04:28,432 --> 01:04:31,600
Say, listen, just where
is all this company that I'm

1507
01:04:31,702 --> 01:04:33,001
being kicked out because of?

1508
01:04:33,103 --> 01:04:34,703
Because I'm gonna tell you this.

1509
01:04:34,805 --> 01:04:37,272
You're not gonna
feed 'em my turkey.

1510
01:04:37,374 --> 01:04:38,206
No sir.

1511
01:04:38,308 --> 01:04:39,374
Not to--

1512
01:04:39,476 --> 01:04:40,208
Oh.

1513
01:04:43,313 --> 01:04:45,580
I beg your pardon.

1514
01:04:45,682 --> 01:04:51,186
I guess-- aw.

1515
01:04:51,288 --> 01:04:52,787
I'm sorry, Stella.

1516
01:04:52,890 --> 01:04:53,822
I didn't mean to--

1517
01:04:57,327 --> 01:05:01,162
I guess I'll go now.

1518
01:05:01,265 --> 01:05:02,130
Mr. Dallas.

1519
01:05:12,242 --> 01:05:14,843
He had a little too
much Christmas, I guess.

1520
01:05:14,945 --> 01:05:16,778
He was here a
while ago and brought a turkey,

1521
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:21,016
and I had a terrible
time getting rid of him.

1522
01:05:21,118 --> 01:05:22,517
What did you find
out about the train?

1523
01:05:22,619 --> 01:05:24,753
Well, I'm afraid it
would be too late, Stella.

1524
01:05:24,855 --> 01:05:25,787
I'm sorry.

1525
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:31,326
I'm all ready.

1526
01:05:31,428 --> 01:05:32,494
Was I very long?

1527
01:05:32,596 --> 01:05:36,097
Not at all, darling.

1528
01:05:36,199 --> 01:05:36,898
Goodbye, Stella.

1529
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,900
I'll take good care of her.

1530
01:05:39,002 --> 01:05:40,869
Goodbye, Stephen.

1531
01:05:40,971 --> 01:05:42,070
Goodbye, Mother.

1532
01:05:46,977 --> 01:05:48,443
Goodbye, Stella.

1533
01:05:48,545 --> 01:05:49,611
Thank you for letting me go.

1534
01:05:49,713 --> 01:05:50,445
Bye.

1535
01:06:07,497 --> 01:06:08,763
Mrs. Dallas, Mr. Morley.

1536
01:06:08,865 --> 01:06:10,031
How do
you do, Mrs. Dallas?

1537
01:06:10,133 --> 01:06:11,800
Won't you sit down, please?

1538
01:06:17,074 --> 01:06:19,941
Mrs. Dallas, I wrote you a
letter, and in it I stated--

1539
01:06:20,043 --> 01:06:21,509
You don't have to
tell me what you stated,

1540
01:06:21,611 --> 01:06:23,044
just tell me what you meant.

1541
01:06:23,146 --> 01:06:25,413
Mrs. Dallas, it's only natural
to suppose that you should

1542
01:06:25,515 --> 01:06:26,982
wish to legalize your position.

1543
01:06:27,084 --> 01:06:28,583
Legalize my position?

1544
01:06:28,685 --> 01:06:30,118
Well, I've got our
marriage license.

1545
01:06:30,220 --> 01:06:32,787
Look here, Mr. Morley, what
are you trying to give me?

1546
01:06:32,889 --> 01:06:34,255
Your freedom.

1547
01:06:34,358 --> 01:06:35,824
A divorce.

1548
01:06:35,926 --> 01:06:40,095
Mr. Dallas feels, and I
can readily understand why,

1549
01:06:40,197 --> 01:06:41,863
that you might wish to remarry.

1550
01:06:41,965 --> 01:06:43,264
Remarry?

1551
01:06:43,367 --> 01:06:45,133
Listen, Mr. Morley, let's
get down to brass tacks.

1552
01:06:45,235 --> 01:06:48,570
I haven't the slightest
idea of ever remarrying.

1553
01:06:48,672 --> 01:06:53,508
Now, it don't happen by
any chance to be Mr. Dallas

1554
01:06:53,610 --> 01:06:55,310
who wishes to remarry, does it?

1555
01:06:55,412 --> 01:06:59,080
Well, assuming for the
moment that it does, surely

1556
01:06:59,182 --> 01:07:00,915
you could have no objection?

1557
01:07:01,018 --> 01:07:03,351
Your allowance
would be the same.

1558
01:07:03,453 --> 01:07:06,554
As a matter of fact, Mr. Dallas
might even be able to increase

1559
01:07:06,656 --> 01:07:07,555
the amount he's sending you.

1560
01:07:07,657 --> 01:07:08,857
I don't want any increases.

1561
01:07:08,959 --> 01:07:10,458
Let him keep it and let
me keep my daughter.

1562
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:14,029
Mrs. Dallas, Mr. Dallas has
no intention of any change

1563
01:07:14,131 --> 01:07:15,230
regarding your daughter.

1564
01:07:15,332 --> 01:07:16,798
Oh, he hasn't?

1565
01:07:16,900 --> 01:07:20,001
Then what's he been trying
to win her away for?

1566
01:07:20,103 --> 01:07:23,271
Taking her to fine hotels,
country places, townhouses!

1567
01:07:23,373 --> 01:07:25,073
Making her dissatisfied
with the kind of things

1568
01:07:25,175 --> 01:07:26,374
I've been giving her.

1569
01:07:26,476 --> 01:07:28,109
Does he think I don't
see what he's after?

1570
01:07:28,211 --> 01:07:30,145
Well, he'll never get away
with it and I'll tell you why.

1571
01:07:30,247 --> 01:07:32,247
Because I'm going to
give her the same things!

1572
01:07:32,349 --> 01:07:34,049
Everything her
heart's been set on.

1573
01:07:34,151 --> 01:07:36,484
Fine hotels, fancy friends,
she's going to have 'em all.

1574
01:07:36,586 --> 01:07:39,187
And I'm gonna give 'em to her
and he's gonna pay for 'em.

1575
01:07:39,289 --> 01:07:41,489
If he's got any extra increases,
he can just hand 'em over.

1576
01:07:41,591 --> 01:07:43,458
And if he don't, maybe
I'll get a lawyer

1577
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:45,660
and bring in the name of
that highfalutin' widow!

1578
01:07:45,762 --> 01:07:46,961
But Mrs. Dallas--

1579
01:07:47,064 --> 01:07:48,530
I won't keep you any
longer, Mr. Morley,

1580
01:07:48,632 --> 01:07:49,931
thank you very much.

1581
01:07:50,033 --> 01:07:51,666
Just see the check is
mailed to the same place.

1582
01:07:51,768 --> 01:07:54,569
That all the benefits I want.

1583
01:07:54,671 --> 01:07:57,138
No.

1584
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:58,540
Mm-mm.

1585
01:07:58,642 --> 01:07:59,574
This one'll do.

1586
01:07:59,676 --> 01:08:01,910
Look, put some more lace on it.

1587
01:08:46,356 --> 01:08:48,623
Nice one!

1588
01:08:48,725 --> 01:08:51,259
You're wonderful, Laurel!

1589
01:08:51,361 --> 01:08:53,661
Dick, you threw
me that last game.

1590
01:08:53,763 --> 01:08:54,896
Threw it?

1591
01:08:54,998 --> 01:08:56,331
The last one came
over like a bullet.

1592
01:08:56,433 --> 01:08:57,832
Is that any way to
treat your teacher?

1593
01:08:59,202 --> 01:09:00,502
That's the way to
take him over, Laurel!

1594
01:09:00,604 --> 01:09:01,736
What's the matter, Dick,
you losing your edge?

1595
01:09:02,839 --> 01:09:04,172
Laurel, this is Mrs. Clews.

1596
01:09:04,274 --> 01:09:05,607
I'm glad to know you.

1597
01:09:05,709 --> 01:09:06,574
How do you do, my dear?

1598
01:09:06,676 --> 01:09:07,775
You're improving rapidly.

1599
01:09:07,878 --> 01:09:08,710
My teacher.

1600
01:09:08,812 --> 01:09:10,111
Say, Laurel.

1601
01:09:10,213 --> 01:09:11,112
We're going to have Dad's
box for the polo game.

1602
01:09:11,214 --> 01:09:12,013
Won't you come with us?

1603
01:09:12,115 --> 01:09:14,015
Oh, I'd love to!

1604
01:09:14,117 --> 01:09:16,551
But I should spend the
afternoon with my mother.

1605
01:09:16,653 --> 01:09:17,452
See you dinner, then.

1606
01:09:17,554 --> 01:09:18,286
Fine.

1607
01:09:18,388 --> 01:09:19,387
Bye-bye.

1608
01:09:19,489 --> 01:09:20,922
How is your
mother today, dear?

1609
01:09:21,024 --> 01:09:22,457
Oh, she's much
better, thank you.

1610
01:09:22,559 --> 01:09:24,559
Couldn't Mrs. Clews and I
visit with her this afternoon

1611
01:09:24,661 --> 01:09:25,960
while you go to the polo?

1612
01:09:26,062 --> 01:09:26,861
Oh, yes.

1613
01:09:26,963 --> 01:09:28,296
That's an idea, mother.

1614
01:09:28,398 --> 01:09:30,498
You know, I've been looking
forward to meeting her.

1615
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:32,901
It's unfortunate that
she's been ill all the time.

1616
01:09:33,003 --> 01:09:33,868
What do you say, Laurel?

1617
01:09:33,970 --> 01:09:34,736
I'll have to ask Mother.

1618
01:09:34,838 --> 01:09:35,570
Come on.

1619
01:09:35,672 --> 01:09:37,071
All right.

1620
01:09:37,174 --> 01:09:38,406
I'll call you.

1621
01:09:38,508 --> 01:09:39,107
All right.

1622
01:09:44,414 --> 01:09:45,180
Mother!

1623
01:09:48,018 --> 01:09:50,084
Hello, darling.

1624
01:09:50,187 --> 01:09:51,819
Did you have a good time?

1625
01:09:51,922 --> 01:09:53,254
Oh, heavenly.

1626
01:09:53,356 --> 01:09:55,990
Mother, Richard's mother
and a Mrs. Clews I just met

1627
01:09:56,092 --> 01:09:57,692
want to go to the polo game.

1628
01:09:57,794 --> 01:10:00,495
And they want to spend
the afternoon with you.

1629
01:10:00,597 --> 01:10:03,431
Oh, and see me for the
first time in my nightgown?

1630
01:10:03,533 --> 01:10:04,065
Huh!

1631
01:10:04,167 --> 01:10:05,967
I should say not.

1632
01:10:06,069 --> 01:10:07,535
Me with a trunk
full of new clothes

1633
01:10:07,637 --> 01:10:10,772
my skin is just
itching to get next to.

1634
01:10:10,874 --> 01:10:12,507
Goodness gracious.

1635
01:10:12,609 --> 01:10:15,543
Oh, but you go along
and say I was asleep.

1636
01:10:15,645 --> 01:10:17,011
Oh, no, I won't
leave you alone again.

1637
01:10:17,113 --> 01:10:18,546
Oh, don't be silly.

1638
01:10:18,648 --> 01:10:20,348
There's no sense of the two
of us being cooped up here.

1639
01:10:20,450 --> 01:10:22,283
I'll be all right in a few days,
and then I'll get all fixed up

1640
01:10:22,385 --> 01:10:23,651
and meet your friends right.

1641
01:10:23,753 --> 01:10:27,522
You know what I was thinking?

1642
01:10:27,624 --> 01:10:30,525
The first night I'm able to
go down in the dining room,

1643
01:10:30,627 --> 01:10:33,861
we'll have this Richard and
his mother to dinner with us.

1644
01:10:33,964 --> 01:10:36,864
Would you like that?

1645
01:10:36,967 --> 01:10:37,799
Lolly?

1646
01:10:37,901 --> 01:10:38,766
Oh!

1647
01:10:41,137 --> 01:10:42,203
I knew you would.

1648
01:10:47,310 --> 01:10:48,309
Oh, now run along.

1649
01:10:48,411 --> 01:10:49,644
You mustn't keep him waiting.

1650
01:10:49,746 --> 01:10:50,278
Wear your blue jacket.

1651
01:10:50,380 --> 01:10:51,412
I love you in that.

1652
01:10:51,514 --> 01:10:52,247
All right.

1653
01:13:26,770 --> 01:13:27,535
Boy!

1654
01:13:27,637 --> 01:13:29,670
Oh, boy.

1655
01:13:29,773 --> 01:13:34,509
Listen, will you tell me which
lady is Mrs. Richard Grosvenor?

1656
01:13:34,611 --> 01:13:36,611
Mrs. Grosvenor's
not here, ma'am.

1657
01:13:36,713 --> 01:13:38,913
Oh, then please direct
me to the tennis court.

1658
01:13:39,015 --> 01:13:40,248
Maybe she's there.

1659
01:13:40,350 --> 01:13:42,617
You go just across the
lawn and down that path.

1660
01:13:42,719 --> 01:13:45,019
You mean sort of over
that way and down there?

1661
01:13:45,121 --> 01:13:45,853
Yes, ma'am.

1662
01:13:45,955 --> 01:13:46,888
Oh.

1663
01:13:46,990 --> 01:13:50,191
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

1664
01:13:50,293 --> 01:13:51,292
Here you are, young fellow.

1665
01:13:51,394 --> 01:13:52,427
Oh, that's all right.

1666
01:13:52,529 --> 01:13:53,060
Oh!

1667
01:13:53,163 --> 01:13:54,328
Don't be sill'.

1668
01:13:54,431 --> 01:13:55,363
Thank you.

1669
01:14:12,182 --> 01:14:12,947
Here goes a birdie.

1670
01:14:18,455 --> 01:14:19,587
Did I say birdie?

1671
01:14:19,689 --> 01:14:20,988
Well, whew!

1672
01:14:35,638 --> 01:14:37,505
Trying to cover it up, huh?

1673
01:14:37,607 --> 01:14:39,774
No, I'll wear it everywhere.

1674
01:14:43,279 --> 01:14:44,745
Did you see
the makeup on her?

1675
01:14:44,848 --> 01:14:45,880
And those shoes!

1676
01:14:45,982 --> 01:14:47,014
Why, I thought
she was wearing stilts!

1677
01:14:48,084 --> 01:14:48,883
Hello, there.

1678
01:14:48,985 --> 01:14:50,117
Hi, Dick, how are you?

1679
01:14:50,220 --> 01:14:50,952
Come on, move on.

1680
01:14:51,054 --> 01:14:52,119
Move down one seat.

1681
01:14:52,222 --> 01:14:53,187
Say, whatever
happened to you two?

1682
01:14:53,289 --> 01:14:54,322
We've been back hours.

1683
01:14:54,424 --> 01:14:55,523
Oh, we took a shortcut.

1684
01:14:55,625 --> 01:14:56,190
Yeah.

1685
01:14:59,395 --> 01:15:01,395
Say, Paul, you
sure missed the show.

1686
01:15:01,498 --> 01:15:02,697
What'll it be, Mr. Grosvenor?

1687
01:15:02,799 --> 01:15:03,764
What show?

1688
01:15:03,867 --> 01:15:05,766
Oh, that woman
on the tennis court.

1689
01:15:05,869 --> 01:15:07,502
Well, I'll have a
chocolate ice cream

1690
01:15:07,604 --> 01:15:09,637
soda with chocolate ice cream
and lots of whipped cream

1691
01:15:09,739 --> 01:15:10,338
on top.

1692
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:11,873
What about her?

1693
01:15:11,975 --> 01:15:13,841
Make mine the same, only
make it with vanilla ice cream

1694
01:15:13,943 --> 01:15:14,842
and leave off the goo.

1695
01:15:14,944 --> 01:15:16,143
OK.

1696
01:15:16,246 --> 01:15:17,478
I didn't know they
let that kind of woman loose

1697
01:15:17,580 --> 01:15:18,713
anymore.
- Happy?

1698
01:15:18,815 --> 01:15:20,848
You should
have seen the getup.

1699
01:15:20,950 --> 01:15:21,782
What a woman!

1700
01:15:21,885 --> 01:15:23,184
Say, maybe
Dick knows her.

1701
01:15:23,286 --> 01:15:24,652
Dick, she was looking
for your mother.

1702
01:15:24,754 --> 01:15:26,053
Yeah?

1703
01:15:26,155 --> 01:15:27,455
Weren't she a panic when
Pete lobbed one over the fence

1704
01:15:27,557 --> 01:15:29,290
and she started
chasing after it?

1705
01:15:30,660 --> 01:15:31,592
I never saw
her before, did you?

1706
01:15:31,694 --> 01:15:33,027
Who is she?
- I don't know.

1707
01:15:33,129 --> 01:15:35,062
I'd sure like to know where
she got that paint job.

1708
01:15:35,164 --> 01:15:37,098
Just
needs a new coat.

1709
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:38,165
Shh!

1710
01:15:47,076 --> 01:15:49,844
That's not a woman,
it's a Christmas tree.

1711
01:15:49,946 --> 01:15:50,478
And it walks!

1712
01:15:50,580 --> 01:15:51,746
Does it talk?

1713
01:15:51,848 --> 01:15:54,715
And how!

1714
01:15:54,817 --> 01:15:56,150
Good?

1715
01:15:56,252 --> 01:15:58,419
Mm, delicious.

1716
01:15:58,521 --> 01:15:59,687
That's the one there.

1717
01:15:59,789 --> 01:16:01,222
I heard her say to
Jimmy, "you ought to see

1718
01:16:01,324 --> 01:16:02,790
my little girl play tennis."

1719
01:16:02,892 --> 01:16:04,725
She must have
some little girl.

1720
01:16:04,827 --> 01:16:06,060
No, I don't like it.

1721
01:16:06,162 --> 01:16:08,062
Well, it is rather heavy.

1722
01:16:08,164 --> 01:16:09,230
Oh, let me see that one.

1723
01:16:09,332 --> 01:16:10,865
- This one?
- Yeah.

1724
01:16:10,967 --> 01:16:11,532
She's an ad!

1725
01:16:11,634 --> 01:16:13,267
An ad for what?

1726
01:16:13,369 --> 01:16:14,302
We'll see in a minute.

1727
01:16:14,404 --> 01:16:16,304
Wait'll her hat lights up.

1728
01:16:16,406 --> 01:16:17,238
You're all wrong.

1729
01:16:17,340 --> 01:16:18,673
It's a trailer.

1730
01:16:18,775 --> 01:16:21,142
Do you think that one
really suits my personality?

1731
01:16:21,244 --> 01:16:22,009
Yes, ma'am.

1732
01:16:22,111 --> 01:16:22,843
Decidedly.

1733
01:16:22,946 --> 01:16:23,978
You do?

1734
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:24,879
I'll take that.

1735
01:16:24,981 --> 01:16:26,447
Send it up to Room 214.

1736
01:16:26,549 --> 01:16:27,315
214.
Mm-hm.

1737
01:16:27,417 --> 01:16:28,149
Thank you.

1738
01:16:31,688 --> 01:16:35,256
Personality.

1739
01:16:35,358 --> 01:16:36,090
Hey, Pete.

1740
01:16:36,192 --> 01:16:36,958
Get her.

1741
01:16:41,464 --> 01:16:42,363
What's the matter?

1742
01:16:42,465 --> 01:16:44,198
I-- I must have lost my watch!

1743
01:16:45,435 --> 01:16:46,367
Wait a minute,
Laurel, you can't

1744
01:16:46,469 --> 01:16:47,668
go all the way back there now.

1745
01:16:47,770 --> 01:16:48,869
When did you see it
last, do you remember?

1746
01:16:48,972 --> 01:16:51,105
I-- I want to go,
please let me go!

1747
01:16:51,207 --> 01:16:52,440
Don't worry about it.

1748
01:16:52,542 --> 01:16:53,474
Let's finish our sodas first.

1749
01:16:53,576 --> 01:16:54,542
We'll find it.

1750
01:17:05,455 --> 01:17:07,321
There you are!

1751
01:17:07,423 --> 01:17:11,392
I've been looking
all over for you, I--

1752
01:17:11,494 --> 01:17:15,096
well, Lolly, what on earth--

1753
01:17:15,198 --> 01:17:16,764
Mother, we're going home.

1754
01:17:16,866 --> 01:17:17,531
Home?

1755
01:17:17,634 --> 01:17:19,567
What are you talking--

1756
01:17:19,669 --> 01:17:20,434
well, what's the matter?

1757
01:17:20,536 --> 01:17:21,268
What's happened?

1758
01:17:21,371 --> 01:17:22,503
Nothing.

1759
01:17:22,605 --> 01:17:26,040
Oh, I know.

1760
01:17:26,142 --> 01:17:28,876
My little Lolly's had a
quarrel with her young man.

1761
01:17:28,978 --> 01:17:30,945
Mother, please!

1762
01:17:31,047 --> 01:17:32,980
Oh, Lolly, don't
be a little goose.

1763
01:17:33,082 --> 01:17:34,081
I tell you what you do.

1764
01:17:34,183 --> 01:17:35,549
I'll call him up and
invite him to dinner,

1765
01:17:35,652 --> 01:17:36,984
make believe I don't
know anything about it.

1766
01:17:37,086 --> 01:17:39,086
I'll pretend you're not back
yet What's their number?

1767
01:17:39,188 --> 01:17:39,920
Mother!

1768
01:17:46,129 --> 01:17:47,061
I want to go home.

1769
01:17:49,799 --> 01:17:53,167
You want to go home?

1770
01:17:53,269 --> 01:17:57,271
Well- well, what about me?

1771
01:17:57,373 --> 01:18:02,243
Paying for two rooms all this
time and using only a bed.

1772
01:18:02,345 --> 01:18:03,310
Don't you think
I'd like a little

1773
01:18:03,413 --> 01:18:06,280
of the fun you've been having?

1774
01:18:06,382 --> 01:18:10,184
I should think you'd think of
somebody else besides yourself.

1775
01:18:10,286 --> 01:18:16,090
You know, I like nice people
and a little fun myself.

1776
01:18:16,192 --> 01:18:17,058
I'm sorry.

1777
01:18:20,530 --> 01:18:22,196
I don't see how your
pride would let you

1778
01:18:22,298 --> 01:18:24,098
show him you cared that much.

1779
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:27,134
If it was me, I'd stay on
just to show him that there's

1780
01:18:27,236 --> 01:18:28,536
other fish in the sea.

1781
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:33,574
Oh, Lolly.

1782
01:18:33,676 --> 01:18:36,944
It's only for you.

1783
01:18:37,046 --> 01:18:39,413
Well, you said yourself
this morning you'd never

1784
01:18:39,515 --> 01:18:42,383
been so happy in all your life.

1785
01:18:42,485 --> 01:18:45,186
And so was I, too.

1786
01:18:53,229 --> 01:18:54,295
Oh, dear.

1787
01:18:54,397 --> 01:18:55,129
Here.

1788
01:19:12,482 --> 01:19:15,449
Here you are, miss.

1789
01:19:15,551 --> 01:19:17,384
Thank you.

1790
01:19:17,487 --> 01:19:20,688
All aboard!

1791
01:19:26,662 --> 01:19:28,229
She said that as
sure as she lives--

1792
01:19:28,331 --> 01:19:29,597
Well, she's got my bag.

1793
01:19:29,699 --> 01:19:31,565
Oh, there she is.

1794
01:19:31,667 --> 01:19:32,533
Lynn!

1795
01:19:32,635 --> 01:19:33,434
Oh good heavens.

1796
01:19:33,536 --> 01:19:34,769
Did you have a blowout?

1797
01:19:34,871 --> 01:19:36,837
No, but just as I was
leaving, I met Ethel.

1798
01:19:36,939 --> 01:19:39,006
Oh, I can't get my breath.

1799
01:19:39,108 --> 01:19:40,741
Here, sit down.

1800
01:19:40,843 --> 01:19:42,710
But I want to tell you
what Ethel told me.

1801
01:19:42,812 --> 01:19:44,612
Do you remember that
funny-looking woman

1802
01:19:44,714 --> 01:19:46,113
parading around the
grounds this afternoon?

1803
01:19:46,215 --> 01:19:47,348
No, I didn't see her.
But Joan was--

1804
01:19:47,450 --> 01:19:48,382
I bet you didn't see her.

1805
01:19:48,484 --> 01:19:49,750
She can't be described.

1806
01:19:49,852 --> 01:19:51,318
You wouldn't believe it.

1807
01:19:51,420 --> 01:19:54,088
I'll tell you, she was quite
a number, dresses up to here,

1808
01:19:54,190 --> 01:19:57,291
and paint an inch thick,
and bells on her shoes

1809
01:19:57,393 --> 01:19:58,592
that tinkled all the time.

1810
01:19:58,694 --> 01:19:59,927
Oh, not bells.

1811
01:20:00,029 --> 01:20:01,428
And bracelets up
to here, that clanked.

1812
01:20:01,531 --> 01:20:03,697
You never saw such a sight.

1813
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:05,266
Anyway, do you know who she was?

1814
01:20:05,368 --> 01:20:06,267
Who?

1815
01:20:06,369 --> 01:20:07,401
Laurel Dallas' mother.

1816
01:20:07,503 --> 01:20:08,235
Laurel Dallas?

1817
01:20:08,337 --> 01:20:09,270
No!

1818
01:20:09,372 --> 01:20:10,504
Boy, I can't believe it.

1819
01:20:10,606 --> 01:20:11,772
You mean that
pretty little girl

1820
01:20:11,874 --> 01:20:12,807
Dick Grosvenor's been rushing?
Yes.

1821
01:20:12,909 --> 01:20:13,774
Didn't you know that?

1822
01:20:13,876 --> 01:20:15,376
But are you sure?

1823
01:20:15,478 --> 01:20:17,178
She seems so lovely and sweet.

1824
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:18,012
I know it.

1825
01:20:18,114 --> 01:20:19,280
Isn't it weird?

1826
01:20:19,382 --> 01:20:21,582
To have such a common-looking
creature for a mother.

1827
01:20:21,684 --> 01:20:22,817
Poor thing.

1828
01:20:22,919 --> 01:20:24,251
Poor nothing.

1829
01:20:24,353 --> 01:20:25,920
She's wearing Dick
Grosvenor's fraternity pin.

1830
01:20:26,022 --> 01:20:28,088
She won't be
wearing it long, I bet.

1831
01:20:28,191 --> 01:20:29,957
Not when Mrs.
Grosvenor hears about it.

1832
01:20:30,059 --> 01:20:31,325
Your bags
is ready, ladies.

1833
01:20:31,427 --> 01:20:32,159
Oh, all right.

1834
01:20:32,261 --> 01:20:32,993
Thank you.

1835
01:20:33,095 --> 01:20:34,295
I want to tell you about it--

1836
01:21:18,608 --> 01:21:19,874
Lollie?

1837
01:21:19,976 --> 01:21:21,876
It's lonely up there, mother.

1838
01:21:21,978 --> 01:21:25,846
I want to come down here
and cuddle with you.

1839
01:21:52,441 --> 01:21:54,408
I'd-- I--

1840
01:21:54,510 --> 01:21:56,644
I'd like to see Mrs. Morrison.

1841
01:21:56,746 --> 01:21:58,479
Was it in reference to--

1842
01:21:58,581 --> 01:21:59,313
I-- I couldn't say.

1843
01:21:59,415 --> 01:22:00,514
It's private.

1844
01:22:00,616 --> 01:22:02,449
And I-- I have to
see Mrs. Morrison.

1845
01:22:02,551 --> 01:22:04,485
What was the name, please?

1846
01:22:04,587 --> 01:22:09,290
Mrs. Dallas, Mrs.
Stephen Dallas.

1847
01:22:09,392 --> 01:22:10,257
Yes.

1848
01:22:16,399 --> 01:22:19,466
I will see if Mrs.
Morrison is at home.

1849
01:22:19,568 --> 01:22:20,935
Come with me, please.

1850
01:22:28,577 --> 01:22:30,077
Just wait in there, please.

1851
01:22:30,179 --> 01:22:31,478
Yeah.

1852
01:23:16,092 --> 01:23:18,993
Mrs. Dallas?

1853
01:23:19,095 --> 01:23:23,130
Are--
are you Mrs. Morrison?

1854
01:23:23,232 --> 01:23:25,299
Yes.

1855
01:23:25,401 --> 01:23:27,601
Oh, I, um--

1856
01:23:27,703 --> 01:23:32,306
I'm-- I'm sorry to bother
you in your home, but I--

1857
01:23:32,408 --> 01:23:33,374
Won't you sit down?

1858
01:23:33,476 --> 01:23:34,441
No.

1859
01:23:34,543 --> 01:23:35,676
What I have to say
won't take very long.

1860
01:23:35,778 --> 01:23:36,944
It's just that I--

1861
01:23:37,046 --> 01:23:38,846
Oh, well, we may as
well be comfortable.

1862
01:23:38,948 --> 01:23:42,783
It's so very warm.

1863
01:23:42,885 --> 01:23:44,852
Won't you take off your coat?

1864
01:23:44,954 --> 01:23:48,489
I-- I know you must
think it's funny,

1865
01:23:48,591 --> 01:23:50,090
me coming here like this.

1866
01:23:50,192 --> 01:23:54,661
I'm not going to beat around the
bush, but what I want to know

1867
01:23:54,764 --> 01:23:56,263
is, if--

1868
01:23:56,365 --> 01:24:00,334
if Stephen was free, if I got a
divorce like his lawyer wanted,

1869
01:24:00,436 --> 01:24:01,468
would--

1870
01:24:01,570 --> 01:24:05,639
would you two get married?

1871
01:24:05,741 --> 01:24:08,675
Yes, we would.

1872
01:24:08,778 --> 01:24:09,943
I'm sorry if it's unpleasant.

1873
01:24:10,046 --> 01:24:14,114
But I'd rather that
you knew the truth.

1874
01:24:14,216 --> 01:24:15,449
Yeah.

1875
01:24:15,551 --> 01:24:20,788
Um, well, what I wanted to
know is if you and Stephen did

1876
01:24:20,890 --> 01:24:24,792
get married, um--

1877
01:24:24,894 --> 01:24:26,026
well, what about Laurel?

1878
01:24:26,128 --> 01:24:28,429
Would you take her too?

1879
01:24:28,531 --> 01:24:31,832
Oh no, Mrs. Dallas.

1880
01:24:31,934 --> 01:24:33,467
I'm a mother.

1881
01:24:33,569 --> 01:24:35,936
Do you think I could ever
deprive another mother

1882
01:24:36,038 --> 01:24:37,204
of her only little girl?

1883
01:24:37,306 --> 01:24:39,139
Yeah, but if the
mother didn't want her--

1884
01:24:39,241 --> 01:24:46,413
I mean, if she couldn't
very well have her, well,

1885
01:24:46,515 --> 01:24:48,315
if it was inconvenient?

1886
01:24:48,417 --> 01:24:49,616
Inconvenient?

1887
01:24:49,718 --> 01:24:50,751
Yeah.

1888
01:24:50,853 --> 01:24:54,388
You see, Lollie's
growing up now.

1889
01:24:54,490 --> 01:24:57,858
And she-- well, she's
quite a responsibility.

1890
01:24:57,960 --> 01:25:00,727
Well, I don't understand.

1891
01:25:00,830 --> 01:25:03,030
Well, you see, it's this way.

1892
01:25:03,132 --> 01:25:04,698
From now on, there's
lots of things

1893
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:06,133
Lollie ought to begin having.

1894
01:25:06,235 --> 01:25:07,468
Oh, I don't mean money.

1895
01:25:07,570 --> 01:25:12,739
But dances and parties,
you know, good times.

1896
01:25:12,842 --> 01:25:15,175
And really, I--

1897
01:25:15,277 --> 01:25:17,444
I've never been much
at that sort of thing.

1898
01:25:17,546 --> 01:25:21,248
So I-- I feel that I've done
about all I can for her.

1899
01:25:21,350 --> 01:25:25,352
So I-- I thought that you being
so crazy about her father,

1900
01:25:25,454 --> 01:25:30,624
and she taking after him
so much, that well, if uh--

1901
01:25:30,726 --> 01:25:33,927
you and Stephen got
married, why, Lollie could

1902
01:25:34,029 --> 01:25:36,964
come and live with you and--

1903
01:25:37,066 --> 01:25:39,733
your name being Mrs.
Dallas, you see,

1904
01:25:39,835 --> 01:25:45,139
well, everybody would naturally
think she was your little girl.

1905
01:25:45,241 --> 01:25:51,645
And then when you went
places, you see, well--

1906
01:25:51,747 --> 01:25:58,485
you see, you're the kind
of a mother that any girl

1907
01:25:58,587 --> 01:26:00,854
would be proud of.

1908
01:26:02,758 --> 01:26:04,424
I didn't know anyone
could be so unselfish.

1909
01:26:04,527 --> 01:26:06,860
And I'll say one
thing, Mrs. Morrison,

1910
01:26:06,962 --> 01:26:08,662
you'd never be ashamed
of Lollie either.

1911
01:26:08,764 --> 01:26:09,796
Oh.

1912
01:26:09,899 --> 01:26:11,165
Everybody's just
crazy about her.

1913
01:26:11,267 --> 01:26:13,901
She-- well, she makes
a wonderful impression.

1914
01:26:14,003 --> 01:26:16,136
She's so refined and
elegant in her ways.

1915
01:26:16,238 --> 01:26:19,139
But oh, you already know that.

1916
01:26:19,241 --> 01:26:24,978
Anyway, she's--
well, anyway, she's--

1917
01:26:25,080 --> 01:26:27,447
well, she's crazy
about you already.

1918
01:26:27,550 --> 01:26:29,383
She don't talk as
much as she used to.

1919
01:26:29,485 --> 01:26:32,152
But that's because she thinks
I'm jealous or something.

1920
01:26:32,254 --> 01:26:35,455
And oh, I guess I was a little.

1921
01:26:35,558 --> 01:26:37,858
But I'm not anymore.

1922
01:26:37,960 --> 01:26:38,859
And you'll see.

1923
01:26:38,961 --> 01:26:42,629
In a little while, she'll--

1924
01:26:42,731 --> 01:26:46,733
well, in a little while she'll--

1925
01:26:46,835 --> 01:26:48,368
she'll forget all about me.

1926
01:26:48,470 --> 01:26:52,940
And it-- why, it won't
be any time before

1927
01:26:53,042 --> 01:26:57,744
she'll she'll love you just--

1928
01:26:57,846 --> 01:27:01,014
just you were her real mother.

1929
01:27:01,116 --> 01:27:03,150
And oh, Mrs. Morrison,
she's so wonderful.

1930
01:27:03,252 --> 01:27:04,084
You don't know.

1931
01:27:04,186 --> 01:27:06,186
I do know.

1932
01:27:06,288 --> 01:27:09,122
And I know that it hasn't
come only from her father.

1933
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:19,633
I have to go.

1934
01:27:19,735 --> 01:27:22,703
Lollie doesn't know
I've come here and I--

1935
01:27:22,805 --> 01:27:24,037
I don't want her to yet.

1936
01:27:24,139 --> 01:27:27,007
She-- she's awfully
funny underneath

1937
01:27:27,109 --> 01:27:28,809
and I've thought it all out.

1938
01:27:28,911 --> 01:27:32,679
It'll be better to just let her
come for the visit like always.

1939
01:27:32,781 --> 01:27:35,716
And-- and by that time
it'll all be over.

1940
01:27:35,818 --> 01:27:38,952
The-- divorce, I mean.

1941
01:27:39,054 --> 01:27:43,624
And-- and you can
break it to her.

1942
01:27:43,726 --> 01:27:45,525
It'll be easier that way.

1943
01:27:52,501 --> 01:27:53,166
Aboard!

1944
01:27:53,269 --> 01:27:54,034
Goodbye, darling.

1945
01:27:54,136 --> 01:27:55,702
- Goodbye.
- Go on.

1946
01:27:55,804 --> 01:27:56,570
Get inside.

1947
01:27:56,672 --> 01:27:57,471
Goodbye, mother.

1948
01:27:57,573 --> 01:27:58,438
Goodbye, dear.

1949
01:27:58,540 --> 01:27:59,306
Goodbye.

1950
01:28:04,580 --> 01:28:05,679
You'll write to me, won't you?

1951
01:28:05,781 --> 01:28:07,080
Oh, yes I will!

1952
01:28:07,182 --> 01:28:09,383
Now, have a nice time
and don't think about me!

1953
01:28:09,485 --> 01:28:11,151
Wear your new blue
dress tonight!

1954
01:28:11,253 --> 01:28:13,520
I want to see you
in my mind's eye.

1955
01:28:13,622 --> 01:28:14,655
All right!

1956
01:28:14,757 --> 01:28:15,489
Bye!

1957
01:28:15,591 --> 01:28:16,456
I love you!

1958
01:28:16,558 --> 01:28:18,825
Goodbye!

1959
01:28:18,927 --> 01:28:20,827
Goodbye, mother!

1960
01:28:20,929 --> 01:28:21,795
Goodbye!

1961
01:28:26,235 --> 01:28:28,101
Goodbye, mother!

1962
01:28:42,451 --> 01:28:43,717
It's a lot of fun, isn't it?

1963
01:28:43,819 --> 01:28:45,018
Yes.

1964
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:45,986
Haven't you really
ever played it before?

1965
01:28:46,088 --> 01:28:47,587
No, honestly, I haven't.

1966
01:28:47,690 --> 01:28:49,489
John wouldn't go to bed until
I promised to bring these in,

1967
01:28:49,591 --> 01:28:51,091
so you'd still have some
members of the family

1968
01:28:51,193 --> 01:28:52,225
to keep you company tonight.

1969
01:28:52,328 --> 01:28:53,694
Oh, how sweet.

1970
01:28:53,796 --> 01:28:54,961
Oh, that John.

1971
01:28:55,064 --> 01:28:56,163
And here's their breakfast.

1972
01:28:56,265 --> 01:28:57,731
Gosh, you sure
stand high with John.

1973
01:28:57,833 --> 01:29:00,567
Why, he won't let Lee and me
see him, let alone, feed him.

1974
01:29:01,770 --> 01:29:03,570
Well, I suppose it's
time young gentleman

1975
01:29:03,672 --> 01:29:05,639
removed themselves from
ladies boudoirs, eh, Con?

1976
01:29:05,741 --> 01:29:06,340
OK, dad.

1977
01:29:06,442 --> 01:29:07,207
Goodnight, sweetheart.

1978
01:29:07,309 --> 01:29:08,909
Goodnight, father.

1979
01:29:09,011 --> 01:29:10,243
Goodnight, darling,
and sleep well.

1980
01:29:10,346 --> 01:29:11,345
Goodnight dear, I will.

1981
01:29:11,447 --> 01:29:12,412
Thank you.
- Goodnight, Laurel.

1982
01:29:12,514 --> 01:29:13,680
I'll see you in the morning.

1983
01:29:13,782 --> 01:29:14,815
Right, Con.
Uh-huh.

1984
01:29:14,917 --> 01:29:15,882
Goodnight, mother.

1985
01:29:15,984 --> 01:29:18,585
I'll put these
in a safe place.

1986
01:29:18,687 --> 01:29:21,521
Oh, I never saw
father so happy before.

1987
01:29:21,623 --> 01:29:24,658
And you, dear, are you happy?

1988
01:29:24,760 --> 01:29:27,561
So very, for you both.

1989
01:29:27,663 --> 01:29:32,165
But I've been worrying and
worrying about something.

1990
01:29:32,267 --> 01:29:34,634
Why, what could
possibly be worrying you?

1991
01:29:34,737 --> 01:29:38,004
Well, I don't know
what to call you.

1992
01:29:39,274 --> 01:29:42,476
Oh, if that's all,
oh, I'm so glad.

1993
01:29:42,578 --> 01:29:45,145
Because I have something
to tell you which I hope

1994
01:29:45,247 --> 01:29:47,047
will make you just as
happy as it has me.

1995
01:29:47,149 --> 01:29:50,751
From now on, you're going to
be one of us reality, dear.

1996
01:29:50,853 --> 01:29:52,285
You're going to be a
member of this family

1997
01:29:52,388 --> 01:29:55,155
like Con and Lee and John.

1998
01:29:55,257 --> 01:29:56,690
They're your brothers.

1999
01:29:56,792 --> 01:29:59,926
And this is going to be your
home as much as it is theirs.

2000
01:30:00,028 --> 01:30:01,228
This, my home?

2001
01:30:01,330 --> 01:30:02,462
Yes, dear.

2002
01:30:02,564 --> 01:30:04,798
You're going to live with us.

2003
01:30:04,900 --> 01:30:05,999
Live here?

2004
01:30:06,101 --> 01:30:10,337
Here, the townhouse,
wherever we are.

2005
01:30:10,439 --> 01:30:12,172
Does it make you happy, Laurel?

2006
01:30:12,274 --> 01:30:16,576
Oh yes, it makes
me very happy.

2007
01:30:16,678 --> 01:30:19,045
To know-- to know that
you want me, and I--

2008
01:30:19,148 --> 01:30:21,715
I do love you all so very much.

2009
01:30:21,817 --> 01:30:24,117
But-- but I couldn't
leave my mother.

2010
01:30:24,219 --> 01:30:27,020
Oh, you won't be leaving her.

2011
01:30:27,122 --> 01:30:29,689
Your mother will
always be your mother.

2012
01:30:29,792 --> 01:30:32,926
I could never expect
or even want to take

2013
01:30:33,028 --> 01:30:34,528
her place in your heart.

2014
01:30:34,630 --> 01:30:36,229
You will visit her
whenever you like.

2015
01:30:36,331 --> 01:30:39,132
No, no, I couldn't.

2016
01:30:39,234 --> 01:30:42,636
Oh thank you ever and
ever so much, Mrs--

2017
01:30:42,738 --> 01:30:47,207
Laurel, your mother, your
father, all of us who love you,

2018
01:30:47,309 --> 01:30:48,508
feel it now that
you're getting older,

2019
01:30:48,610 --> 01:30:50,076
there are-- there
are many advantages

2020
01:30:50,179 --> 01:30:52,045
that we can give you.

2021
01:30:52,147 --> 01:30:53,079
I know.

2022
01:30:53,182 --> 01:30:55,449
I-- I know.

2023
01:30:55,551 --> 01:30:58,285
And I do thank you.

2024
01:30:58,387 --> 01:31:00,253
But I-- I'm sorry.

2025
01:31:00,355 --> 01:31:01,288
Goodnight, Con.

2026
01:31:01,390 --> 01:31:03,657
Goodnight, dad.

2027
01:31:03,759 --> 01:31:05,358
Father?

2028
01:31:05,461 --> 01:31:06,526
Yes, dear?

2029
01:31:09,498 --> 01:31:10,997
What is it, dear?

2030
01:31:11,099 --> 01:31:15,202
Father, you-- you don't mean
you thought that I could live

2031
01:31:15,304 --> 01:31:16,670
anywhere ever without mother?

2032
01:31:16,772 --> 01:31:20,440
Well, you've lived without me.

2033
01:31:20,542 --> 01:31:21,641
Your mother and I
are just changing

2034
01:31:21,743 --> 01:31:23,743
places for a while, that's all.

2035
01:31:23,846 --> 01:31:25,345
Isn't it fair for me to
have a little of what

2036
01:31:25,447 --> 01:31:26,913
she's had all these years?

2037
01:31:27,015 --> 01:31:28,748
But that's different, father.

2038
01:31:28,851 --> 01:31:30,150
You know it is.

2039
01:31:30,252 --> 01:31:32,752
I've been with mother all these
years because I needed her.

2040
01:31:32,855 --> 01:31:36,223
Now she needs me and-- and
you need me less than ever.

2041
01:31:36,325 --> 01:31:37,657
Oh, Laurel, don't say that.

2042
01:31:37,759 --> 01:31:39,359
I'm sorry, Laurel, if
you don't see that what

2043
01:31:39,461 --> 01:31:40,694
we've planned is for your good.

2044
01:31:40,796 --> 01:31:42,662
We thought it would
make you happy.

2045
01:31:42,764 --> 01:31:44,130
Your mother and I
have decided upon what

2046
01:31:44,233 --> 01:31:45,232
we think is best for you.

2047
01:31:45,334 --> 01:31:46,399
My mother, does she know?

2048
01:31:46,502 --> 01:31:47,968
Certainly.

2049
01:31:48,070 --> 01:31:50,403
We have your interests
equally at heart, haven't we?

2050
01:31:50,506 --> 01:31:53,206
We both feel that this
should be your home

2051
01:31:53,308 --> 01:31:54,307
for at least a few years.

2052
01:31:54,409 --> 01:31:56,042
I'm sorry, father.

2053
01:31:56,144 --> 01:31:59,779
But please understand, my
home will be with my mother

2054
01:31:59,882 --> 01:32:02,716
as long as I live.

2055
01:32:02,818 --> 01:32:03,884
Now, Laurel--

2056
01:32:03,986 --> 01:32:05,185
Oh, Stephen.

2057
01:32:05,287 --> 01:32:07,387
Laurel, you don't
understand, dear.

2058
01:32:07,489 --> 01:32:10,023
This was all your mother's
idea, her wish for you.

2059
01:32:10,125 --> 01:32:11,658
She planned it all herself.

2060
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:13,827
Your father had
nothing to do with it.

2061
01:32:13,929 --> 01:32:15,428
She came to see me and
we talked it all over.

2062
01:32:15,531 --> 01:32:16,963
My mother came to see you?

2063
01:32:17,065 --> 01:32:17,797
Yes, dear we felt--

2064
01:32:17,900 --> 01:32:18,565
When did she come?

2065
01:32:18,667 --> 01:32:19,966
Well, I don't know--

2066
01:32:20,068 --> 01:32:21,201
Was it just after we
got back from the Mirador?

2067
01:32:21,303 --> 01:32:22,969
Well, I believe it was.

2068
01:32:23,071 --> 01:32:23,870
But--

2069
01:32:23,972 --> 01:32:28,174
Oh, oh my poor mother.

2070
01:32:28,277 --> 01:32:30,443
My wonderful mother.

2071
01:32:30,546 --> 01:32:32,145
Oh, she wasn't asleep.

2072
01:32:32,247 --> 01:32:33,079
She wasn't.

2073
01:32:33,181 --> 01:32:35,048
She heard what they said.

2074
01:32:35,150 --> 01:32:36,416
Oh, I must go to her!

2075
01:32:36,518 --> 01:32:38,351
I must go to her at once!

2076
01:32:38,453 --> 01:32:39,586
Darling, tell us about it.

2077
01:32:39,688 --> 01:32:40,587
Now, now, sweetie--

2078
01:32:40,689 --> 01:32:42,522
Oh, oh, please daddy, help me.

2079
01:32:42,624 --> 01:32:44,391
I can't make my visit here.

2080
01:32:44,493 --> 01:32:46,092
I must go to my mother.

2081
01:32:46,194 --> 01:32:47,494
Don't, sweetheart.

2082
01:33:41,550 --> 01:33:43,617
Sure, you can see him.

2083
01:33:43,719 --> 01:33:47,320
That ain't meanin'
that he can see you.

2084
01:33:47,422 --> 01:33:49,923
Hey, Munn!

2085
01:33:50,025 --> 01:33:51,458
Somebody to see ya!

2086
01:34:07,409 --> 01:34:08,141
Ed?

2087
01:34:15,617 --> 01:34:16,816
Ed, wake up.

2088
01:34:16,918 --> 01:34:17,651
It's Stella.

2089
01:34:19,888 --> 01:34:22,956
Ed, it's me, Stella Dallas.

2090
01:34:23,992 --> 01:34:24,991
Hello, Stell.

2091
01:34:25,093 --> 01:34:27,093
Look, I still live
in the same old flat.

2092
01:34:27,195 --> 01:34:28,695
Oh yeah?

2093
01:34:28,797 --> 01:34:30,196
And I want you to take this,
get a Turkish bath and a shave

2094
01:34:30,298 --> 01:34:31,031
and come right over.

2095
01:34:31,133 --> 01:34:32,399
Do you understand?

2096
01:34:32,501 --> 01:34:34,167
Ed, do you understand?

2097
01:34:34,269 --> 01:34:35,001
Sure.

2098
01:34:36,104 --> 01:34:37,003
I got it.

2099
01:35:00,128 --> 01:35:00,860
Mother?

2100
01:35:04,499 --> 01:35:05,231
Mommy!

2101
01:35:11,907 --> 01:35:13,339
Mother?

2102
01:35:13,442 --> 01:35:14,174
Mother?

2103
01:35:31,560 --> 01:35:33,460
Mother.

2104
01:35:33,562 --> 01:35:34,861
Oh, mother.

2105
01:35:34,963 --> 01:35:37,430
Oh, Lollie, when
did you-- well,

2106
01:35:37,532 --> 01:35:39,833
whatever brought you back?

2107
01:35:39,935 --> 01:35:41,801
Mother, how could you think?

2108
01:35:41,903 --> 01:35:45,772
As if I could ever live
anywhere else but with you?

2109
01:35:45,874 --> 01:35:48,241
Oh, well, I thought
you'd like it for a while.

2110
01:35:48,343 --> 01:35:49,409
No, really.

2111
01:35:49,511 --> 01:35:51,678
You-- you always
seemed to have such

2112
01:35:51,780 --> 01:35:53,513
a good time with your father.

2113
01:35:53,615 --> 01:35:57,617
Yes, but-- but
good times, oh, they

2114
01:35:57,719 --> 01:36:00,053
aren't what make you belong.

2115
01:36:00,155 --> 01:36:03,857
It's-- it's the
other kind of times.

2116
01:36:03,959 --> 01:36:06,459
It's when you've
cried together and--

2117
01:36:06,561 --> 01:36:09,696
and when you've been
through things together.

2118
01:36:09,798 --> 01:36:15,835
Oh, that's when you
seem to love the most.

2119
01:36:15,937 --> 01:36:19,339
It-- it's different when you--

2120
01:36:19,441 --> 01:36:22,208
didn't they send the telegram?
they said they would.

2121
01:36:22,310 --> 01:36:24,711
Oh, most likely they tried
to deliver it and I was out.

2122
01:36:24,813 --> 01:36:26,613
I've been on the go
ever since you went.

2123
01:36:26,715 --> 01:36:28,681
Put those in water
for me, will you?

2124
01:36:28,784 --> 01:36:29,682
Oh, they're lovely.

2125
01:36:29,785 --> 01:36:31,718
Yeah, from an old admirer.

2126
01:36:31,820 --> 01:36:34,220
Ed Munn blew into town
and I've been stepping

2127
01:36:34,322 --> 01:36:35,221
out with him for a change.

2128
01:36:35,323 --> 01:36:36,055
Ed Munn?

2129
01:36:36,158 --> 01:36:36,756
Yeah.

2130
01:36:36,858 --> 01:36:38,057
Now, put 'em in water.

2131
01:36:38,160 --> 01:36:40,827
I want 'em all fixed
nice when he gets here.

2132
01:36:49,638 --> 01:36:51,638
Mother, you don't
mean that you and--

2133
01:36:51,740 --> 01:36:53,940
Lollie, haven't
you fixed them yet?

2134
01:36:54,843 --> 01:36:55,942
Give them to me.

2135
01:37:09,391 --> 01:37:11,291
Get some water.

2136
01:37:19,734 --> 01:37:21,234
That'll tickle him.

2137
01:37:25,740 --> 01:37:27,473
Lollie!

2138
01:37:27,576 --> 01:37:35,481
Mother, don't you remember a
long time ago, when he said--

2139
01:37:35,584 --> 01:37:37,083
and-- and you promised
about him that--

2140
01:37:37,185 --> 01:37:39,485
Oh, Lollie, I know
what you're driving at.

2141
01:37:39,588 --> 01:37:40,820
Now, let me tell you something.

2142
01:37:40,922 --> 01:37:44,424
I-- I've spent the best
years of my life on you.

2143
01:37:44,526 --> 01:37:47,193
A woman wants to be something
else besides a mother,

2144
01:37:47,295 --> 01:37:49,195
you know.

2145
01:37:49,297 --> 01:37:51,130
Well, you will know
when you get grown up.

2146
01:37:51,233 --> 01:37:53,566
You can't explain
everything to a child.

2147
01:37:53,668 --> 01:37:54,434
Now, go on.

2148
01:37:54,536 --> 01:37:55,602
Run along.

2149
01:39:06,341 --> 01:39:08,641
I'll come back
to stay if you still want me.

2150
01:39:08,743 --> 01:39:09,642
Still want you?

2151
01:39:09,744 --> 01:39:11,244
Laurel, my dear.

2152
01:39:11,346 --> 01:39:12,378
Don't.

2153
01:39:12,480 --> 01:39:13,212
Oh.

2154
01:39:16,685 --> 01:39:18,584
Father!

2155
01:39:20,655 --> 01:39:21,955
Tell me, dear,
what is it, angel?

2156
01:39:22,057 --> 01:39:23,523
What is it, darling?

2157
01:39:23,625 --> 01:39:24,924
Oh, daddy!

2158
01:39:25,026 --> 01:39:25,925
What is it, dear?

2159
01:39:26,027 --> 01:39:28,094
What is it, sweetheart?

2160
01:39:34,936 --> 01:39:38,604
I-- I thought it
was my sake she wanted

2161
01:39:38,707 --> 01:39:40,807
me to come and live with you.

2162
01:39:40,909 --> 01:39:44,377
And I was so glad and so proud.

2163
01:39:44,479 --> 01:39:45,778
But it wasn't.

2164
01:39:45,880 --> 01:39:48,348
It was for him.

2165
01:39:48,450 --> 01:39:50,316
She wanted to marry him!

2166
01:39:53,788 --> 01:39:54,687
Please don't cry, darling.

2167
01:39:54,789 --> 01:39:55,822
You knew him!

2168
01:39:55,924 --> 01:39:56,689
You knew?

2169
01:39:56,791 --> 01:39:57,523
Yes, I--

2170
01:39:57,625 --> 01:39:59,125
And she chose him!

2171
01:39:59,227 --> 01:40:03,296
Come, Laurel, come
upstairs with me, dear.

2172
01:40:03,398 --> 01:40:04,297
All right.

2173
01:40:09,904 --> 01:40:10,636
So long!

2174
01:40:10,739 --> 01:40:12,638
Thanks a lot!

2175
01:40:12,741 --> 01:40:13,606
Well, hello.

2176
01:40:13,708 --> 01:40:14,440
You back?

2177
01:40:14,542 --> 01:40:15,375
Gee, that's great.

2178
01:40:15,477 --> 01:40:16,209
Hello, Con.

2179
01:40:16,311 --> 01:40:17,310
Hello, Con.

2180
01:40:17,412 --> 01:40:19,445
Say, who do you
think brought me home?

2181
01:40:19,547 --> 01:40:20,480
Dick Grosvenor.

2182
01:40:20,582 --> 01:40:21,647
We were just talking about you.

2183
01:40:21,750 --> 01:40:22,849
Say, you wait here.
I'll go get him.

2184
01:40:22,951 --> 01:40:23,750
He's still in the driveway.

2185
01:40:23,852 --> 01:40:25,251
Oh, no, Con!
No, no!

2186
01:40:25,353 --> 01:40:27,153
Oh, i don't want to see him.
- It's fine.

2187
01:40:27,255 --> 01:40:27,954
Not now.

2188
01:40:28,056 --> 01:40:29,422
No, darling.

2189
01:40:29,524 --> 01:40:30,990
Oh, no, no, not yet.

2190
01:40:31,092 --> 01:40:32,291
You go on upstairs, dear.

2191
01:40:32,394 --> 01:40:33,726
We'll take of Dick.

2192
01:40:33,828 --> 01:40:34,861
Hey, Dick!

2193
01:40:34,963 --> 01:40:36,029
What?

2194
01:40:36,131 --> 01:40:37,196
Come on back!

2195
01:40:37,298 --> 01:40:38,331
Laurel's here!

2196
01:40:38,433 --> 01:40:39,899
- When did she get back?
- I don't know.

2197
01:40:40,001 --> 01:40:41,200
She was here when I got here.

2198
01:40:41,302 --> 01:40:42,735
How do
you do, Mrs. Dallas?

2199
01:40:42,837 --> 01:40:43,903
Good, how do you do?
- How do you do, Mr. Dallas.

2200
01:40:44,005 --> 01:40:44,904
I'm glad to see you again.

2201
01:40:45,006 --> 01:40:46,205
Oh, glad to see you, Dick.

2202
01:40:46,307 --> 01:40:48,074
Con
told me Laurel was here.

2203
01:40:48,176 --> 01:40:49,442
All right, fella'.

2204
01:40:49,544 --> 01:40:50,076
That's one on me.

2205
01:40:50,178 --> 01:40:51,244
No, she's here.

2206
01:40:51,346 --> 01:40:52,512
Hey mother, Laurel's
here, isn't she?

2207
01:40:52,614 --> 01:40:53,479
Yes, she's here.

2208
01:40:53,581 --> 01:40:54,514
Won't you stay for dinner?

2209
01:40:54,616 --> 01:40:56,482
Why, if I'm allowed as I am.

2210
01:40:56,584 --> 01:40:57,917
Of course.

2211
01:40:58,019 --> 01:40:59,118
If you don't mind, I'd
like to wash up too, please.

2212
01:40:59,220 --> 01:41:00,453
Sure.
Boy, come on up to my room, huh?

2213
01:41:00,555 --> 01:41:01,954
- Thank you, Con.
- Now, hurry up, will ya?

2214
01:41:02,057 --> 01:41:03,823
OK, dad.

2215
01:41:03,925 --> 01:41:05,725
Stephen.

2216
01:41:05,827 --> 01:41:07,860
Laurel is here.

2217
01:41:07,962 --> 01:41:10,997
She's here to stay.

2218
01:41:11,099 --> 01:41:13,966
Who's accomplished it?

2219
01:41:14,069 --> 01:41:17,170
Couldn't you read between
those pitiful lines?

2220
01:41:28,216 --> 01:41:29,916
Rugs.

2221
01:41:30,018 --> 01:41:31,918
I told you, those curtains
weren't to be drawn.

2222
01:41:32,020 --> 01:41:33,886
Open them, please.

2223
01:41:33,988 --> 01:41:35,421
Yes, madam.

2224
01:41:40,228 --> 01:41:40,960
Yes.

2225
01:41:45,233 --> 01:41:47,700
Now you must light the
candles, and we must hurry.

2226
01:41:47,802 --> 01:41:48,701
Yes, madam.

2227
01:41:53,141 --> 01:41:57,510
Come dear, it's
nearly time for our cue.

2228
01:41:57,612 --> 01:41:59,512
What's this?

2229
01:41:59,614 --> 01:42:02,281
Oh, my darling.

2230
01:42:02,383 --> 01:42:08,621
I was just thinking, I never
really thought that my mother--

2231
01:42:08,723 --> 01:42:12,024
I thought that she would
read about the wedding.

2232
01:42:12,127 --> 01:42:15,094
And even though she was
too far away to come,

2233
01:42:15,196 --> 01:42:16,896
at least she would write to me.

2234
01:42:16,998 --> 01:42:20,366
Oh my dear, do you
think if she knew,

2235
01:42:20,468 --> 01:42:24,170
any distance in the world
could keep her away?

2236
01:42:24,272 --> 01:42:27,440
Then you think she
just doesn't know?

2237
01:42:43,925 --> 01:42:45,825
Sorry, bu you
can't stand here.

2238
01:42:45,927 --> 01:42:48,027
We have to keep this clear.

2239
01:43:41,816 --> 01:43:43,115
Move along, please.

2240
01:43:43,218 --> 01:43:45,184
Break up the group here.

2241
01:43:51,726 --> 01:43:53,059
You too, lady.

2242
01:43:53,161 --> 01:43:54,460
Oh, please, let me see
her face when he kisses her,

2243
01:43:54,562 --> 01:43:55,127
please.

2244
01:44:28,463 --> 01:44:29,795
All right, well,
you've seen enough.

2245
01:44:29,897 --> 01:44:30,696
Come along.

2246
01:44:30,798 --> 01:44:31,797
Move along please, now.

2247
01:44:31,899 --> 01:44:33,633
Come on, clear the sidewalk.
