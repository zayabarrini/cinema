1
00:00:22,251 --> 00:00:26,001
CELINE AND JULIE GO BOATING

2
00:01:14,209 --> 00:01:18,626
<i>Usually, it began like this.</i>

3
00:02:12,126 --> 00:02:15,251
MAGIC

4
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:26,334
Fill out a card, please.

5
00:14:10,251 --> 00:14:13,209
<i>But the next morning...</i>

6
00:14:58,792 --> 00:15:00,209
Here...

7
00:15:00,292 --> 00:15:03,417
This is yours, Miss.

8
00:15:04,709 --> 00:15:06,792
Thank you, Sir.

9
00:15:07,584 --> 00:15:10,251
No, I won't have coffee.

10
00:15:33,626 --> 00:15:35,334
Not here.

11
00:15:35,959 --> 00:15:38,834
For you this time.

12
00:16:04,876 --> 00:16:08,667
Here, Lil, for your collection.

13
00:16:09,042 --> 00:16:11,626
- This one's from Borneo.
- Java?

14
00:16:11,792 --> 00:16:14,251
- Java good time?
- Sure.

15
00:16:14,417 --> 00:16:16,751
Better than Kilimanjaro before that.

16
00:16:25,542 --> 00:16:26,792
How's that?

17
00:16:27,084 --> 00:16:30,917
Past... future.

18
00:16:31,167 --> 00:16:33,792
Escape from prison, theatrical coup.

19
00:16:35,001 --> 00:16:37,417
The Chariot. New start. Conquest.

20
00:16:47,584 --> 00:16:49,834
It's your lucky day.

21
00:16:50,334 --> 00:16:53,876
- Oh, Death.
- No, it's affirmative.

22
00:16:55,917 --> 00:17:01,126
Movement, change, the end...
becoming radiance, triumph.

23
00:17:01,709 --> 00:17:04,417
Conquest. The Sun.

24
00:17:04,584 --> 00:17:06,584
How useless.

25
00:17:06,876 --> 00:17:09,126
Don't burn yourself.

26
00:17:12,334 --> 00:17:14,251
You do me now.

27
00:17:26,501 --> 00:17:31,959
The Past. The Hanged Man. Below is
above. Your future is behind you.

28
00:17:33,876 --> 00:17:38,292
And you plunge into the depths...
of night.

29
00:17:39,584 --> 00:17:41,001
My future...

30
00:17:43,667 --> 00:17:46,251
Your grandfather the hermit...
protects you.

31
00:17:47,459 --> 00:17:51,501
You don't move. You don't advance.

32
00:17:53,042 --> 00:17:55,917
You advance, but in total immobility.

33
00:17:56,084 --> 00:17:58,459
- Stagnation.
- Triumphal nevertheless.

34
00:17:58,709 --> 00:18:00,042
Despite the stagnation.

35
00:18:00,334 --> 00:18:03,751
So my future is in the present.

36
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:05,542
Exactly.

37
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:09,917
That's fine. I like paper.
I like the smell of wax.

38
00:18:13,667 --> 00:18:17,209
- It'll go better tomorrow.
- Let's hope so.

39
00:18:17,376 --> 00:18:20,334
Well, back to our places.

40
00:18:23,709 --> 00:18:26,042
Back to literature.

41
00:18:31,001 --> 00:18:31,959
Sir.

42
00:18:34,459 --> 00:18:37,001
You may smoke... discreetly.

43
00:20:44,376 --> 00:20:47,209
The children are being very noisy.

44
00:21:06,209 --> 00:21:09,084
Is "White Elephant" back?

45
00:21:09,584 --> 00:21:12,876
No, he's on a trip to Australia.

46
00:21:13,126 --> 00:21:16,792
Have "Naive Larks"...

47
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:20,542
...and "Ladies of Flajolie" gone?

48
00:21:21,126 --> 00:21:23,292
Like "Spiders in the Night.”

49
00:21:37,209 --> 00:21:39,709
"Death with a Blue Ribbon.”

50
00:21:41,792 --> 00:21:42,834
"Before the Mirror"?

51
00:21:49,084 --> 00:21:52,542
"Before the Mirror"... 11th July...

52
00:22:00,751 --> 00:22:02,876
1578.

53
00:25:19,876 --> 00:25:23,751
Madame Michelle, I told you not to
let your cats stray!

54
00:25:26,542 --> 00:25:28,626
Sorry, did I wake you?

55
00:25:32,501 --> 00:25:35,542
I thought it was them after me again.

56
00:25:37,376 --> 00:25:39,042
Don't you think you need a bed?

57
00:25:39,209 --> 00:25:43,376
I must wash... a shower...
I must take a shower.

58
00:25:45,292 --> 00:25:48,126
You had three phone calls
while I slept.

59
00:25:51,167 --> 00:25:53,251
First door on the left.

60
00:26:49,501 --> 00:26:51,417
It's wild.

61
00:26:51,959 --> 00:26:54,292
My last African safari...

62
00:26:56,876 --> 00:26:57,959
...was really wild.

63
00:27:01,917 --> 00:27:04,251
The heat was killing us.

64
00:27:09,917 --> 00:27:13,417
Hunting animals every day
in the savannah.

65
00:27:17,209 --> 00:27:19,292
I had a boa cockstrictor.

66
00:27:21,667 --> 00:27:23,459
A boa constrictor?

67
00:27:24,751 --> 00:27:28,209
Right! A boa cockstrictor
that stuck it to me.

68
00:27:34,917 --> 00:27:38,417
Not dangerous, I put him around
my neck.

69
00:27:55,209 --> 00:28:00,417
When the natives killed the biggest
tiger of all, they said...

70
00:28:04,584 --> 00:28:07,334
...it was the Bengali tiger.

71
00:28:10,334 --> 00:28:15,001
From Bengal, the region of Africa
we were in. Do you know it?

72
00:28:17,334 --> 00:28:19,334
It's a blue and brown bird.

73
00:28:20,376 --> 00:28:22,584
I was the Pigmy emperor's guest.

74
00:28:25,084 --> 00:28:29,751
But Zouba the Giantess was jealous.

75
00:28:30,126 --> 00:28:35,334
She wanted to marry the emperor
who'd given me the tiger-skin.

76
00:28:58,751 --> 00:29:01,626
But since he had given it to me...

77
00:29:01,667 --> 00:29:02,709
Not a bare skin?

78
00:29:04,126 --> 00:29:07,792
Zouba wanted to skin me.

79
00:29:10,751 --> 00:29:12,459
So I ran.

80
00:29:24,626 --> 00:29:28,709
I almost croaked coming back
from the jungle.

81
00:29:30,001 --> 00:29:32,084
I lived through hell.

82
00:29:32,626 --> 00:29:36,626
I lost my hair all over,
plucked clean.

83
00:29:38,084 --> 00:29:41,626
I was scared to death.
I was traumatoed.

84
00:29:41,834 --> 00:29:44,959
- Tomatoed?
- Yes, freaked out.

85
00:29:46,001 --> 00:29:51,209
I was invited to Hong Kong. A cool
place, I'll tell you some day.

86
00:29:52,042 --> 00:29:58,501
A Japanese guy there did
acoopuncture. He did it to me.

87
00:30:00,584 --> 00:30:02,459
After a month...

88
00:30:02,667 --> 00:30:08,917
...my hair grew back, red at first,
then the usual.

89
00:30:09,751 --> 00:30:11,667
Then I came back.

90
00:30:12,042 --> 00:30:15,584
- Who's he?
- That's Grégoire.

91
00:30:17,667 --> 00:30:19,917
Known as Guilou.

92
00:30:22,959 --> 00:30:27,126
A distant cousin from
childhood holidays.

93
00:30:30,667 --> 00:30:35,001
We were lovers, we had our
innocent games.

94
00:30:38,292 --> 00:30:40,542
Playing hospital, etcetera.

95
00:30:41,917 --> 00:30:45,834
On Sundays we'd get married in the
grass behind the presbytery.

96
00:30:46,459 --> 00:30:49,417
Naked as worms, solemn as popes.

97
00:30:50,876 --> 00:30:53,292
Now Guilou's back.

98
00:30:54,501 --> 00:30:56,709
He's written. I'm waiting.

99
00:30:58,417 --> 00:31:02,751
But he wants a white wedding
in church.

100
00:31:04,501 --> 00:31:06,251
What's this relic?

101
00:31:07,959 --> 00:31:10,251
A forgotten forget-me-not.

102
00:31:10,417 --> 00:31:11,959
Isn't it a marguerite?

103
00:31:14,667 --> 00:31:16,667
You're right, it's not a marguerite,
it's a daisy.

104
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:19,876
<i>It was a daisy.</i>

105
00:31:22,751 --> 00:31:24,834
We'll see to that.

106
00:31:57,959 --> 00:31:59,459
Mind if I use alcohol?

107
00:32:01,542 --> 00:32:04,042
Does it hurt you?

108
00:32:04,209 --> 00:32:06,126
It's all right.

109
00:32:16,917 --> 00:32:19,251
I have a first-aid certificate.

110
00:32:22,709 --> 00:32:24,626
How did that happen?

111
00:32:25,126 --> 00:32:29,584
I thought they were after me,
so I ran.

112
00:32:29,751 --> 00:32:31,667
I fell, I was scared.

113
00:32:33,751 --> 00:32:36,167
But who are they? Scared of what?

114
00:32:36,959 --> 00:32:40,584
I'd been hired to work in a house.

115
00:32:43,542 --> 00:32:47,292
Then two days ago... it was
fine until then...

116
00:32:47,459 --> 00:32:50,417
...two days ago I found in my room...

117
00:32:50,751 --> 00:32:53,501
...a bracelet with a foreign girl's
name on it.

118
00:32:56,667 --> 00:33:02,459
The girl before me, I thought,
so I took it to my master.

119
00:33:02,917 --> 00:33:08,292
When he saw it he turned pale.
I thought he'd hit me.

120
00:33:10,376 --> 00:33:13,834
He locked himself in his study
with his wife.

121
00:33:14,084 --> 00:33:19,751
She cried, he shouted, I listened.
Then the other woman came.

122
00:33:21,292 --> 00:33:24,792
So I went away.

123
00:33:27,626 --> 00:33:33,626
I kept out of the way, poked around,
looked in drawers...

124
00:33:34,251 --> 00:33:39,709
...and in one drawer I found
two passports...

125
00:33:40,042 --> 00:33:45,084
...with foreign names - one was
the name on the bracelet.

126
00:33:45,876 --> 00:33:48,584
But the photos were torn out.

127
00:33:50,042 --> 00:33:55,084
Yesterday, when I wanted to
go on looking...

128
00:33:55,876 --> 00:34:01,584
...drawers and cupboards were locked.
I tried to force a drawer.

129
00:34:02,292 --> 00:34:04,167
They caught me at it.

130
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:08,959
I ran away and now they're after me.

131
00:34:11,501 --> 00:34:12,584
Who are they?

132
00:34:15,042 --> 00:34:18,001
The master and the two women.

133
00:34:23,626 --> 00:34:26,167
What did you do in the house?

134
00:34:27,292 --> 00:34:28,834
Nanny.

135
00:34:30,126 --> 00:34:33,001
- There were children?
- Of course.

136
00:34:35,251 --> 00:34:38,417
- How many?
- One.

137
00:34:40,376 --> 00:34:41,501
A little girl?

138
00:34:47,584 --> 00:34:48,709
How old?

139
00:34:49,501 --> 00:34:52,376
Young, seven or eight.

140
00:34:58,792 --> 00:35:02,792
Were the women dark or fair?

141
00:35:02,959 --> 00:35:05,292
Dark and fair.

142
00:35:05,459 --> 00:35:09,626
I don't know their relationship,
they were very secretive.

143
00:35:13,126 --> 00:35:17,459
What did he look like? Grim?

144
00:35:19,001 --> 00:35:22,334
Him? Like your fish.

145
00:35:22,917 --> 00:35:24,376
Black.

146
00:35:30,376 --> 00:35:31,334
All done.

147
00:35:46,459 --> 00:35:48,167
Relax.

148
00:36:47,626 --> 00:36:50,751
I'd kill for a Bloody Mary!

149
00:37:46,917 --> 00:37:49,001
My head hurts.

150
00:37:52,667 --> 00:37:56,667
Relax. Lie down.

151
00:38:27,542 --> 00:38:30,667
Take this. Swallow it whole.

152
00:38:48,126 --> 00:38:50,834
What's the address of that house?

153
00:38:54,626 --> 00:38:57,584
<i>But the next morning...</i>

154
00:39:10,667 --> 00:39:14,042
Lil? It's Julie.

155
00:39:16,126 --> 00:39:18,042
No, not very well.

156
00:39:19,001 --> 00:39:24,209
I don't know... I'm not coming in
today... I'd rather...

157
00:39:25,751 --> 00:39:27,834
No, something popped up.

158
00:39:28,542 --> 00:39:32,459
I'd rather rest. I'll be in tomorrow.

159
00:39:39,917 --> 00:39:42,084
See you tomorrow.

160
00:40:13,917 --> 00:40:16,709
What was the address of that house?

161
00:40:17,501 --> 00:40:21,126
But... I told you yesterday.

162
00:40:24,084 --> 00:40:27,584
7 bis, rue du Nadir aux Pommes.

163
00:40:29,209 --> 00:40:30,959
That's it.

164
00:41:27,251 --> 00:41:30,292
Grégoire? Guilou!

165
00:41:32,751 --> 00:41:35,501
Yes, it's Julie.

166
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:40,917
I'm so happy to hear you.

167
00:41:41,959 --> 00:41:45,251
You sound so close. How odd.

168
00:41:45,417 --> 00:41:49,667
You're in Paris? Since when?
This morning?

169
00:41:51,584 --> 00:41:55,126
I want to see you. Yes, today.

170
00:41:56,334 --> 00:42:01,542
Three o'clock, St. Vincent Square.

171
00:42:04,667 --> 00:42:07,792
Kiss, kiss. See you soon.

172
00:42:28,709 --> 00:42:33,167
<i>To my Julie. The child has
become a man.</i>

173
00:43:43,626 --> 00:43:46,084
It seems people live here.

174
00:43:58,667 --> 00:44:01,709
Nestor! Fancy meeting you.

175
00:45:44,126 --> 00:45:46,209
Guess who.

176
00:45:48,042 --> 00:45:50,917
I recognize those gentle hands...

177
00:45:51,334 --> 00:45:56,126
...the sweetness of this skin,
the pulse of this breathing.

178
00:45:56,292 --> 00:45:58,376
Guilou, you haven't changed a bit.

179
00:46:19,542 --> 00:46:21,709
Do you remember that Monday...

180
00:46:22,042 --> 00:46:25,626
...when I wildly picked 313?

181
00:46:25,792 --> 00:46:30,667
311, because five of them were
dying purple crocuses.

182
00:46:33,084 --> 00:46:36,917
Those days of blind man's bluff,
when I couldn't find you.

183
00:46:37,167 --> 00:46:38,751
I had no dessert.

184
00:46:40,209 --> 00:46:45,501
Yet playing Hot and Cold you found
the farmer's wife hottest.

185
00:46:45,751 --> 00:46:50,959
Josette was always after me,
even in church after Mass.

186
00:46:55,209 --> 00:47:00,876
Has the presbytery lost none of
its charm?

187
00:47:03,126 --> 00:47:05,126
And the young girl...

188
00:47:05,376 --> 00:47:06,584
...none of her innocence?

189
00:47:46,792 --> 00:47:51,751
It's just as I'd imagined.
Nothing's changed.

190
00:47:54,876 --> 00:47:58,251
The cobwebs caressed our bare feet...

191
00:47:58,417 --> 00:48:02,667
...they were silky and soft.

192
00:48:05,167 --> 00:48:10,501
When I pressed you against the hedge
to kiss you, no one could see.

193
00:48:12,376 --> 00:48:17,001
Red mouth smeared... strawberries
crushed in milk...

194
00:48:17,459 --> 00:48:22,459
...sugared kisses, four o'clock,
snacks, heat...

195
00:48:22,709 --> 00:48:28,792
Kisses and rhubarb jam, cigarettes
stolen from Uncle Edouard...

196
00:48:29,417 --> 00:48:31,751
We blew blue smoke rings.

197
00:48:32,167 --> 00:48:36,542
The forget-me-not song...
white sun, brown stomachs...

198
00:48:36,709 --> 00:48:42,501
...the wind howled and we danced
and we loved... ecstasy!

199
00:48:42,667 --> 00:48:46,959
Ecstasy! Perverse and mystic
sodomization.

200
00:48:47,126 --> 00:48:51,792
Homosexual spleen in the barn,
disguised as Alsatians.

201
00:48:52,376 --> 00:48:56,501
Sodom, Gomorrah, teeth grinding,
loins burning...

202
00:48:56,751 --> 00:49:00,917
Hot lava... sleep...

203
00:49:01,334 --> 00:49:05,501
Sleeping, dying of kisses,
sleeping, kisses...

204
00:49:08,209 --> 00:49:11,084
Sleeping, kisses...

205
00:49:12,209 --> 00:49:14,459
Sleeping, kisses...

206
00:49:18,542 --> 00:49:20,626
Finish me off, my man-eater.

207
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:26,334
And now, dear friend, go jack off
among the roses.

208
00:49:30,167 --> 00:49:34,876
You have become an unspeakable
monster of vulgarity.

209
00:49:36,084 --> 00:49:40,751
I never want to see you again.
Goodbye forever, forever goodbye.

210
00:49:53,792 --> 00:49:57,792
It's from the man over there.
Go and thank him.

211
00:51:21,751 --> 00:51:22,792
Mademoiselle Julie?

212
00:51:22,959 --> 00:51:28,001
Mademoiselle Julie has gone far away,
I don't think she'll ever come back.

213
00:52:33,042 --> 00:52:34,959
Where to?

214
00:52:43,292 --> 00:52:46,417
Rue du Calvaire, in Montmartre.

215
00:53:46,084 --> 00:53:50,417
- Tonight you're going to get it.
- I'm going to get it?

216
00:53:53,459 --> 00:53:55,292
You'll be surprised.

217
00:53:55,459 --> 00:53:59,626
You go ahead; I'll go on
keeping my trap shut.

218
00:54:00,584 --> 00:54:02,834
Violins!

219
00:54:07,876 --> 00:54:11,626
If this keeps up, I'm leaving.

220
00:54:12,417 --> 00:54:13,959
I'm eating.

221
00:54:14,292 --> 00:54:17,417
Shut up. Let me tell you a story...

222
00:54:17,584 --> 00:54:21,501
...because compared to your
hang-ups mine are as nothing.

223
00:54:21,667 --> 00:54:24,542
I've met this girl.

224
00:54:25,584 --> 00:54:28,001
And I've dropped my boyfriends.

225
00:54:28,167 --> 00:54:32,709
Shut up! Listen! I've met this woman.

226
00:54:34,084 --> 00:54:38,001
An American. A genuine American.

227
00:54:38,167 --> 00:54:40,251
With butterfly sunglasses?

228
00:54:40,417 --> 00:54:45,376
A terrific young woman,
darling of the gossip columns.

229
00:54:45,542 --> 00:54:51,542
I live at her place. Listen!
I'm not joking.

230
00:54:51,709 --> 00:54:57,834
She has a pink swimming pool. I'll
invite you lot to swim some day.

231
00:54:58,501 --> 00:54:59,959
A heart-shaped pool.

232
00:55:01,417 --> 00:55:07,084
She wants to make me her pygma...
Shit! Her pyg...ma...lion.

233
00:55:07,334 --> 00:55:11,001
- Can we sunbathe?
- Naked.

234
00:55:11,251 --> 00:55:15,167
She's super-rich, her name's in
the papers all the time.

235
00:55:15,334 --> 00:55:19,334
She's taking care of me because
she says I've got something.

236
00:55:19,501 --> 00:55:24,084
She's going to make me a great
lady of the dance.

237
00:55:24,334 --> 00:55:27,042
- Introduce me.
- No, I've got first dibs.

238
00:55:27,209 --> 00:55:29,126
Me next, then.

239
00:55:30,709 --> 00:55:31,834
Is she attractive?

240
00:55:32,001 --> 00:55:34,584
You'll think so. I've been with her
for two days.

241
00:55:34,751 --> 00:55:38,834
How old is she? We've got to
picture her.

242
00:55:39,126 --> 00:55:41,209
- What colour hair?
- Red.

243
00:55:42,334 --> 00:55:44,334
Pale, with freckles.

244
00:55:44,501 --> 00:55:50,126
She gave me a massage.
Well, she has a masseur, he did it.

245
00:55:50,376 --> 00:55:52,209
He's slant-eyed.

246
00:55:52,376 --> 00:55:55,167
- Would she do me?
- She might do guys.

247
00:55:55,334 --> 00:56:00,792
I think she must have some big
political figure behind her.

248
00:56:01,001 --> 00:56:05,417
I don't know about politics,
but there's money for sure.

249
00:56:05,584 --> 00:56:07,584
No names, but that reminds me of...

250
00:56:07,751 --> 00:56:11,834
Yes, an American... he was big in
newspapers, she was like him...

251
00:56:12,001 --> 00:56:14,542
...a bit of a recluse...

252
00:56:14,709 --> 00:56:18,417
...except that my lady's
in the public eye.

253
00:56:18,709 --> 00:56:21,626
Like Marilyn was?

254
00:56:21,834 --> 00:56:24,334
What does your bitch do?

255
00:56:24,501 --> 00:56:27,042
My bitch? You're crazy!

256
00:56:27,292 --> 00:56:29,792
<i>You're not coming swimming.</i>

257
00:56:31,001 --> 00:56:33,001
She doesn't want slobs.

258
00:56:33,167 --> 00:56:34,501
I'm sure I know her.

259
00:56:34,667 --> 00:56:38,501
She's not a dyke, you know.

260
00:56:38,667 --> 00:56:41,626
She's just come from America?

261
00:56:41,792 --> 00:56:47,084
Yes, but she's got a pied-à-terre
in France that's an entire house.

262
00:56:47,251 --> 00:56:49,084
Where?

263
00:56:49,959 --> 00:56:52,542
She told me not to tell,
it's a secret.

264
00:56:52,709 --> 00:56:56,459
Your lady's making it all up.

265
00:56:56,626 --> 00:57:03,292
You're really stupid. She's broke.
She lies to get you to bed.

266
00:57:03,501 --> 00:57:09,376
Idiot! I've been to her place, seen
her money, she has servants.

267
00:57:09,542 --> 00:57:14,501
- Don't be so aggressive.
- I'm not. You're just jealous.

268
00:57:14,667 --> 00:57:17,376
Nobody cares about your American.

269
00:57:17,542 --> 00:57:20,751
You will when you see her.

270
00:57:21,001 --> 00:57:24,292
I wonder if there's a word of truth
in your story.

271
00:57:25,001 --> 00:57:31,626
Listen, Alice, it really is
Wonderland. I'm absolutely ecstatic.

272
00:57:32,292 --> 00:57:35,792
- Lucrezia is zero next to her.
- Tell Alice that!

273
00:57:36,126 --> 00:57:39,626
- I'm getting used to it.
- You're so disgusting.

274
00:57:39,959 --> 00:57:42,126
I'm good at making choices.

275
00:57:42,376 --> 00:57:47,834
- I have good taste, too.
- So have I, not like this lot.

276
00:57:48,542 --> 00:57:50,084
When did all this happen?

277
00:57:50,376 --> 00:57:52,084
Two days ago, stupid.

278
00:57:52,334 --> 00:57:56,167
- Two days... it's not true.
- I won't tell you anything, idiot.

279
00:57:57,126 --> 00:58:00,667
- Shut up!
- Don't get me mad!

280
00:58:00,959 --> 00:58:03,376
- What's the time?
- Six-thirty.

281
00:58:03,626 --> 00:58:05,542
I must buy make-up.

282
00:58:06,001 --> 00:58:07,626
Oh, my sister.

283
00:58:08,334 --> 00:58:10,584
'Bye, Miss Swanky.

284
00:58:15,084 --> 00:58:18,501
Mademoiselle, your fare please.

285
00:58:28,709 --> 00:58:31,501
This way.

286
00:58:31,751 --> 00:58:33,834
Did you have a good day?

287
00:58:35,167 --> 00:58:38,626
I don't remember a thing.

288
00:58:38,792 --> 00:58:40,376
I must get made-up.

289
00:58:53,459 --> 00:58:55,167
And now, the astonishing...

290
00:58:55,417 --> 00:58:59,084
...the amazing, awesome...

291
00:58:59,501 --> 00:59:02,376
...the shimmering...

292
00:59:02,626 --> 00:59:05,834
...the staggering, suggestive...

293
00:59:07,126 --> 00:59:11,751
...most scabrous... most scandalous...

294
00:59:12,417 --> 00:59:14,626
...sensational...

295
00:59:14,876 --> 00:59:16,584
...Mandragora!

296
01:02:30,959 --> 01:02:32,709
It's rigged.

297
01:02:33,667 --> 01:02:35,751
It's fake.

298
01:02:36,459 --> 01:02:37,834
It's fake, sweetie.

299
01:04:47,709 --> 01:04:52,126
What were you just telling me?
Is that your dream?

300
01:04:56,417 --> 01:04:57,542
We all have one...

301
01:04:57,709 --> 01:04:59,792
...deep down.

302
01:05:01,709 --> 01:05:03,167
Best kept there these days.

303
01:05:04,626 --> 01:05:10,709
Could you take the kid out tonight?
I'm too busy with my American.

304
01:05:10,876 --> 01:05:12,292
Where?

305
01:05:12,459 --> 01:05:16,459
I don't know, he'd have fun at the
movies. Right, Paulo?

306
01:05:16,626 --> 01:05:18,709
Would you like that, Paulo?

307
01:05:18,876 --> 01:05:20,626
Have you seen my gloves?

308
01:05:20,792 --> 01:05:23,584
Look what you've done.

309
01:05:26,084 --> 01:05:28,584
May I have a tissue, please?

310
01:05:32,334 --> 01:05:34,667
You all right? Your nose...

311
01:05:34,834 --> 01:05:41,042
Yes, but my skin's breaking out.
I'm sick of all this make-up.

312
01:05:43,376 --> 01:05:45,626
It goes with the job.

313
01:05:45,792 --> 01:05:48,584
I'll become a clown, a sad clown...

314
01:05:49,626 --> 01:05:52,751
...replace Old Père Julien.

315
01:05:54,376 --> 01:05:59,584
I'll get after them, really get up
their noses.

316
01:05:59,751 --> 01:06:01,417
They won't know you?

317
01:06:01,584 --> 01:06:06,292
They wouldn't anyway. They come for
my arse, not my mug.

318
01:06:06,459 --> 01:06:10,626
They doze and drink. Did you see
them tonight?

319
01:06:10,792 --> 01:06:16,709
I like the little pricks as long as
they pay. What are you doing?

320
01:06:17,542 --> 01:06:21,292
Is tomorrow's act ready? Quite ready?

321
01:06:22,959 --> 01:06:25,209
How about this?

322
01:06:26,751 --> 01:06:29,792
Yes, it's all right.

323
01:06:29,959 --> 01:06:34,417
But you should add some feathers...
behind.

324
01:06:34,584 --> 01:06:35,626
I have some.

325
01:06:35,792 --> 01:06:37,709
Green? Not up there!

326
01:06:37,876 --> 01:06:43,792
- She really could do it.
- Feathered Myrtille!

327
01:06:49,417 --> 01:06:53,667
- Hello, kids.
- Hello, Monsieur Dédé.

328
01:06:53,834 --> 01:06:58,542
- Céline, I've something to tell you.
- Tell me here, I have no secrets.

329
01:06:58,709 --> 01:07:01,834
It's good news. Come on.

330
01:07:04,959 --> 01:07:07,542
Wait two minutes for me.

331
01:07:08,001 --> 01:07:12,751
I'm fond of you. You're talented,
full of exuberance and promise.

332
01:07:15,042 --> 01:07:17,959
- I've got you on contract.
- And how!

333
01:07:18,167 --> 01:07:24,667
I'm negotiating a deal on it. A loss
for me, but good for your career.

334
01:07:25,626 --> 01:07:28,209
An international tour.

335
01:07:28,584 --> 01:07:32,917
Ankara, Istanbul, Baghdad, Beirut...

336
01:07:33,417 --> 01:07:37,084
- You're making fun of me.
- Not at all.

337
01:07:37,251 --> 01:07:40,876
In places like that, a great
French artist...

338
01:07:41,084 --> 01:07:44,626
...is worth gold, or better yet,
my dear, worth oil.

339
01:07:44,792 --> 01:07:47,501
I'll settle for oil, I mean gold.

340
01:07:47,667 --> 01:07:50,251
You'll see, you'll make some.

341
01:07:54,501 --> 01:07:59,626
Old Dédé told me that he's got
a tour for me.

342
01:07:59,834 --> 01:08:03,376
An international tour to Ankara,
Beirut...

343
01:08:03,542 --> 01:08:05,042
Wow, Beirut!

344
01:08:05,209 --> 01:08:08,167
It can't be true, I won't go...

345
01:08:08,501 --> 01:08:12,667
He says I'm worth oil, no, gold...
I don't know...

346
01:08:14,126 --> 01:08:16,084
Do you think it's a joke?

347
01:08:20,126 --> 01:08:23,792
- Who is this?
- My cousin.

348
01:08:24,834 --> 01:08:27,084
An American cousin.

349
01:08:27,751 --> 01:08:29,584
With a pool?

350
01:08:29,751 --> 01:08:34,626
Of course. Pink, heart-shaped.

351
01:08:53,792 --> 01:08:56,501
Shit, what's got into you?

352
01:08:57,126 --> 01:09:02,209
Nothing! I remember nothing!
It's no use.

353
01:09:02,501 --> 01:09:06,292
I thought I was doing well,
but nothing went right.

354
01:09:06,501 --> 01:09:13,167
You and your circles... you found me,
that's all, you were in shock.

355
01:09:13,334 --> 01:09:15,001
I don't know.

356
01:09:16,459 --> 01:09:19,667
I'm not getting anywhere.

357
01:09:21,667 --> 01:09:24,709
I don't remember anything.

358
01:09:25,584 --> 01:09:30,334
Look, you're just going...
you're going nuts, eh?

359
01:09:30,626 --> 01:09:32,876
Try. Force yourself.

360
01:09:33,042 --> 01:09:36,001
I am, but I'm getting nowhere.

361
01:09:36,709 --> 01:09:41,209
Look, let's start all over again.
Right?

362
01:09:41,542 --> 01:09:43,542
Try to remember from the moment...

363
01:09:43,709 --> 01:09:45,459
I do start again, it doesn't help.

364
01:09:45,626 --> 01:09:51,292
But start from where you happened
to show up at the club.

365
01:09:51,459 --> 01:09:53,542
Where did you find the taxi?

366
01:09:56,209 --> 01:10:02,126
All right, we'll start from zero.
This is going to be very funny.

367
01:10:14,376 --> 01:10:16,292
I was...

368
01:10:18,542 --> 01:10:19,917
You were...

369
01:10:20,084 --> 01:10:24,792
...pushed out of the house...
propelled.

370
01:10:26,501 --> 01:10:29,626
Then I was... all wobbly.

371
01:10:32,959 --> 01:10:36,917
I felt dizzy.

372
01:10:41,709 --> 01:10:46,209
I was pretty mixed up.

373
01:10:47,334 --> 01:10:50,667
Anyway, I managed to get to
the taxi...

374
01:10:51,584 --> 01:10:57,084
...and once in the taxi I took...

375
01:10:57,834 --> 01:11:03,167
...the sweet from my mouth and
put it in my purse.

376
01:11:03,334 --> 01:11:04,959
What sweet?

377
01:11:05,251 --> 01:11:07,126
This one.

378
01:11:21,376 --> 01:11:23,126
What's the matter?

379
01:11:25,209 --> 01:11:27,126
I see it.

380
01:11:30,417 --> 01:11:32,501
See what?

381
01:11:37,709 --> 01:11:43,084
It is a terrible vow. No one has the
right to make anyone swear it.

382
01:11:44,626 --> 01:11:49,417
Perhaps, but as witness I stand
surety for it.

383
01:11:50,209 --> 01:11:53,917
If you try to disregard it
I will stop you.

384
01:11:57,542 --> 01:12:02,084
Do you think so? Pretty things
do us no harm.

385
01:12:06,417 --> 01:12:08,501
If you say so...

386
01:12:10,001 --> 01:12:12,167
Do not say that word.

387
01:12:32,001 --> 01:12:35,709
You chose the wrong day for
trying to seduce Olivier.

388
01:12:35,917 --> 01:12:37,834
Even so...

389
01:12:39,709 --> 01:12:41,542
You pretend to be unaware of the vow.

390
01:12:41,792 --> 01:12:44,501
Don't go in there!

391
01:12:45,334 --> 01:12:48,417
Was it in the right or left
yesterday?

392
01:12:48,584 --> 01:12:50,501
I've forgotten.

393
01:12:56,126 --> 01:12:59,501
You could lose, but you always win.

394
01:12:59,709 --> 01:13:02,084
You know it is forbidden her.

395
01:13:18,626 --> 01:13:22,251
My own realm, my house, my garden...

396
01:13:22,626 --> 01:13:28,501
...my flowers, my travel books...
for me it was enough.

397
01:13:29,376 --> 01:13:32,584
It would have been enough for
the rest of my life.

398
01:13:33,459 --> 01:13:38,126
But they had to take it away.

399
01:13:38,417 --> 01:13:40,667
The master says it is hereditary.

400
01:13:40,834 --> 01:13:44,501
Well, the scent of these plants
doesn't help matters.

401
01:13:45,542 --> 01:13:47,709
Look what I've drawn for you.

402
01:13:48,042 --> 01:13:49,709
Madlyn...

403
01:13:59,084 --> 01:14:01,584
Blood ties must be renewed.

404
01:14:05,501 --> 01:14:08,459
Must I go on till this ghastly
story ends?

405
01:14:08,626 --> 01:14:12,542
My dear friend, what you have begun
you must complete.

406
01:14:33,251 --> 01:14:34,126
Miss Angèle.

407
01:14:41,334 --> 01:14:44,209
I've no idea where they came from.

408
01:14:44,917 --> 01:14:47,501
But it's odd, though.

409
01:14:50,459 --> 01:14:54,959
They mean something to me,
their faces are familiar.

410
01:14:56,376 --> 01:14:59,126
- They come from far away.
- Yes, they must.

411
01:14:59,292 --> 01:15:04,084
From very far, but they don't seem
at all travel-stained.

412
01:15:04,626 --> 01:15:07,292
Where do they come from?
Zanzibar, Mozambique...

413
01:15:08,167 --> 01:15:13,876
When you've finished with your zzzing
and your childishness...

414
01:15:14,084 --> 01:15:15,792
Look who's talking.

415
01:15:15,959 --> 01:15:21,792
I don't know if my mind went blank
or it's hazy dreams.

416
01:15:21,959 --> 01:15:24,042
It's a mishmash.

417
01:15:26,126 --> 01:15:31,417
It's like four petrified images
of puppets.

418
01:15:31,792 --> 01:15:35,751
Yes, puppets... but they shout...

419
01:15:35,959 --> 01:15:39,084
...eat sweets, faint...

420
01:15:39,251 --> 01:15:42,376
...tell stories...

421
01:15:42,542 --> 01:15:47,417
...fade from grey to blue...
and they swoon.

422
01:15:47,584 --> 01:15:49,917
Totter down stairs...

423
01:15:50,084 --> 01:15:56,584
...and to spice the sauce,
a little blood. Wonderful!

424
01:16:00,417 --> 01:16:04,084
- You know what?
- No, not yet. I'd rather not know.

425
01:16:04,792 --> 01:16:07,626
Why? It will be great.

426
01:16:10,751 --> 01:16:15,334
You don't know the best bit.
Hold on to your seat.

427
01:16:16,042 --> 01:16:19,417
You know the lady in white?

428
01:16:19,876 --> 01:16:23,001
She's my sister.

429
01:16:23,667 --> 01:16:28,709
My twin sister. We're as alike as
two peas in a pod.

430
01:16:29,334 --> 01:16:31,751
The one with none-too-clean hands?

431
01:16:32,876 --> 01:16:36,542
I'm broad-shouldered, but I won't
take all the blame.

432
01:16:36,709 --> 01:16:41,209
You know some pretty weird people.

433
01:16:41,751 --> 01:16:46,209
You should talk, sweetie, your lot
aren't so hot, either.

434
01:16:51,292 --> 01:16:54,084
You make do with what you have.

435
01:16:54,251 --> 01:16:56,334
What you have, you have to get.

436
01:16:57,209 --> 01:17:02,417
It's obvious you never had to eat
shit. The day you do, I'll laugh.

437
01:17:03,417 --> 01:17:05,459
To survive in this life...

438
01:17:05,709 --> 01:17:07,417
...you need dough.

439
01:17:07,626 --> 01:17:14,292
Pack it up, honey, don't make my cry.

440
01:19:42,501 --> 01:19:45,334
<i>But the next morning...</i>

441
01:19:53,376 --> 01:19:56,501
What's the address of your house?

442
01:19:56,751 --> 01:19:59,626
7 rue des Pommes?

443
01:20:02,542 --> 01:20:06,709
It's 7 bis...

444
01:20:08,542 --> 01:20:11,084
...rue du Nadir aux Pommes.

445
01:28:32,376 --> 01:28:34,459
I should have brought my saw.

446
01:29:33,917 --> 01:29:36,001
My Poupie!

447
01:29:36,501 --> 01:29:40,001
It can't be, I must be dreaming.

448
01:29:41,292 --> 01:29:43,209
How you've grown!

449
01:29:43,376 --> 01:29:45,042
After all these years.

450
01:29:45,209 --> 01:29:49,542
My little partridge, my bengali,
how glad I am to see you.

451
01:29:52,751 --> 01:29:54,334
Want your elevenses?

452
01:29:56,917 --> 01:30:02,542
You know, that morning when mother
came for me after all those years...

453
01:30:02,751 --> 01:30:04,626
A baker's dozen.

454
01:30:05,667 --> 01:30:09,751
...I had six months being
coddled by you...

455
01:30:11,251 --> 01:30:14,626
...then she told me Uncle had been
kidnapped by a playboy...

456
01:30:14,792 --> 01:30:17,751
...and taken by helicopter to
the Peloponnese.

457
01:30:18,542 --> 01:30:22,167
Your father did well to leave.

458
01:30:24,001 --> 01:30:26,084
God rest his soul.

459
01:30:28,001 --> 01:30:33,542
What's become of your mother,
with her problems and her men?

460
01:30:34,001 --> 01:30:35,626
I couldn't stand her.

461
01:30:36,084 --> 01:30:40,417
I liked my doll uncles, though...
they were so polite.

462
01:30:44,417 --> 01:30:47,334
Do you ever hear from her?

463
01:30:47,876 --> 01:30:53,751
She flits around, sends me a card
every few months.

464
01:30:54,292 --> 01:30:57,417
The last was from Java.

465
01:30:58,542 --> 01:31:01,084
So she is still the same.

466
01:31:04,876 --> 01:31:08,376
Poupie, do you remember?

467
01:31:09,042 --> 01:31:12,542
The little girl from the house
over there.

468
01:31:13,126 --> 01:31:18,417
After you left she was very ill.
After you left she became difficult.

469
01:31:18,584 --> 01:31:25,001
One day everyone left, I never saw
them again, they never came back.

470
01:31:25,292 --> 01:31:27,459
No news of them.

471
01:31:29,626 --> 01:31:31,959
She was my age.

472
01:31:33,126 --> 01:31:34,959
Their nurse scared you, remember?

473
01:31:39,959 --> 01:31:41,792
No one came back?

474
01:31:42,042 --> 01:31:46,042
Never. The shutters have been
closed ever since then.

475
01:31:47,501 --> 01:31:51,917
Perhaps an heir will come one day
and the shutters will be opened...

476
01:31:52,209 --> 01:31:55,834
...and I'll have some company.

477
01:31:58,542 --> 01:32:02,001
I'd like to see my old room.

478
01:32:02,709 --> 01:32:07,751
It's just as it was, with all your
dolls, I haven't touched it.

479
01:32:08,959 --> 01:32:11,042
I must go.

480
01:32:11,292 --> 01:32:13,042
Already?

481
01:32:13,459 --> 01:32:19,209
But now that I've found you,
I'll come for tea, I promise.

482
01:32:19,376 --> 01:32:23,376
- It's been too long.
- See you soon.

483
01:34:47,292 --> 01:34:48,376
It's broken.

484
01:34:48,667 --> 01:34:51,084
It's in pieces.

485
01:34:55,417 --> 01:34:56,667
Do I swallow them all?

486
01:34:56,917 --> 01:34:58,709
Absolutely not.

487
01:35:02,917 --> 01:35:05,459
You have to take them in order.

488
01:35:07,501 --> 01:35:09,542
There are five pieces.

489
01:35:09,917 --> 01:35:12,459
Well, start with the biggest...

490
01:35:13,584 --> 01:35:17,334
...and end with the teeny-weeny one.

491
01:35:18,501 --> 01:35:20,626
In order.

492
01:35:29,834 --> 01:35:31,626
The tissue will ruin it.

493
01:36:01,751 --> 01:36:06,459
If you only knew the memories
that dress brings back to me.

494
01:36:06,792 --> 01:36:08,376
The sea.

495
01:36:10,459 --> 01:36:11,667
The mountains.

496
01:36:11,834 --> 01:36:13,376
Both.

497
01:36:13,584 --> 01:36:15,042
The Borromean Islands?

498
01:36:15,209 --> 01:36:18,251
Yes, in the evening.

499
01:36:18,501 --> 01:36:22,959
The scent of the lemon trees,
the Kursaal orchestra.

500
01:36:25,209 --> 01:36:29,542
- She was so pale, so fragile.
- More than I?

501
01:36:29,709 --> 01:36:31,042
Out of my sight.

502
01:36:32,334 --> 01:36:35,459
Who? What? Is it...

503
01:36:36,876 --> 01:36:41,001
What out of her sight?
The dress or the girl?

504
01:36:43,167 --> 01:36:46,917
Are they the same ones?
They talk so strangely.

505
01:36:47,084 --> 01:36:50,292
It's a period thing, conventions.

506
01:36:51,251 --> 01:36:54,209
Grand tragedy.

507
01:36:55,584 --> 01:36:57,834
Reeking of mothballs.

508
01:36:58,376 --> 01:37:00,459
Let's continue.

509
01:37:01,042 --> 01:37:03,126
Medium big...

510
01:37:18,751 --> 01:37:23,792
- How is your hand?
- Better, but I must be careful.

511
01:37:23,959 --> 01:37:26,292
Every movement brings peril.

512
01:37:40,042 --> 01:37:42,709
Careful, they are fragile.

513
01:38:15,459 --> 01:38:17,501
Miss Angèle, come quickly.

514
01:38:18,917 --> 01:38:21,709
They're doing the same thing
as yesterday.

515
01:38:21,876 --> 01:38:25,167
- They'll do the same tomorrow.
- The same every day?

516
01:38:26,417 --> 01:38:29,167
- All-day screenings?
- Every day.

517
01:38:29,834 --> 01:38:33,167
So they're doing it in perpetuity.

518
01:38:34,709 --> 01:38:35,917
What next?

519
01:38:37,042 --> 01:38:38,917
My turn now.

520
01:38:41,376 --> 01:38:44,417
- What's up?
- Nothing.

521
01:38:51,292 --> 01:38:52,959
Hello, Madlyn.

522
01:38:56,584 --> 01:38:58,334
Did you sleep well?

523
01:38:59,209 --> 01:39:01,292
Today is a big day.

524
01:39:01,459 --> 01:39:03,792
I disapprove of these little games.

525
01:39:03,959 --> 01:39:07,542
Come, be a sport, Mademoiselle.

526
01:39:08,751 --> 01:39:11,001
What a heady scent.

527
01:39:11,167 --> 01:39:13,792
- Well?
- Well what?

528
01:39:13,959 --> 01:39:16,042
Don't keep me in suspense.

529
01:39:16,209 --> 01:39:17,959
Which hand?

530
01:39:19,834 --> 01:39:23,334
Was it the right or left yesterday?

531
01:39:23,501 --> 01:39:25,584
I've forgotten.

532
01:39:31,959 --> 01:39:34,376
You could lose, but you always win.

533
01:39:34,542 --> 01:39:37,876
You know it is forbidden her.

534
01:39:38,042 --> 01:39:42,709
Madlyn, I've told you not to
hide under the pillow.

535
01:39:43,251 --> 01:39:45,167
What do you mean?

536
01:39:45,751 --> 01:39:47,417
I don't understand.

537
01:39:47,834 --> 01:39:50,376
I've told you, the harm you do her.

538
01:39:50,542 --> 01:39:52,626
I do her no harm.

539
01:39:56,959 --> 01:39:59,376
Keep out of this, Olivier.

540
01:40:00,417 --> 01:40:03,126
I know better than you
how to handle her.

541
01:40:06,334 --> 01:40:08,584
I've cared for her for eight months.

542
01:40:13,084 --> 01:40:16,417
Let me decide; I know better
than you what I'm doing.

543
01:40:16,584 --> 01:40:19,542
Please lower your voices,
the child is resting.

544
01:40:21,626 --> 01:40:24,542
I don't know what I should think.

545
01:40:28,459 --> 01:40:30,126
Well, anyway...

546
01:40:33,084 --> 01:40:35,167
Think what you like.

547
01:40:55,376 --> 01:40:57,459
Today, I'm Angèle.

548
01:40:59,709 --> 01:41:01,792
Yesterday it was me.

549
01:41:02,251 --> 01:41:04,334
But it's still her?

550
01:41:05,876 --> 01:41:07,959
I wonder what she's up to.

551
01:41:08,751 --> 01:41:13,167
And him, what's he up to?
Who is he with?

552
01:41:13,876 --> 01:41:17,417
With Camille? With Sophie?

553
01:41:17,751 --> 01:41:22,792
With Camille and Sophie and Angèle.
What do those ladies want from him?

554
01:41:23,834 --> 01:41:28,001
That's what we may learn
in the next episode.

555
01:41:47,042 --> 01:41:51,001
What did you want to say?

556
01:41:51,542 --> 01:41:54,334
Nothing you don't already know,
Camille.

557
01:41:56,917 --> 01:42:00,584
You chose the wrong day for
trying to seduce Olivier.

558
01:42:00,751 --> 01:42:02,459
Is that all?

559
01:42:04,376 --> 01:42:08,917
You pretend to be unaware of the vow
he made when his wife died.

560
01:42:09,084 --> 01:42:10,376
What vow?

561
01:42:12,459 --> 01:42:16,001
My sister spent her time trapping
people with her vows.

562
01:42:16,209 --> 01:42:19,334
Don't insult that day when
you speak of her.

563
01:42:20,376 --> 01:42:24,334
But if I must repeat it all to you...

564
01:42:24,959 --> 01:42:27,834
Know that Natalie made him swear...

565
01:42:28,001 --> 01:42:31,626
...to safeguard the happiness of
their child, by not remarrying.

566
01:42:31,834 --> 01:42:34,959
This is something I've always known.

567
01:42:35,626 --> 01:42:38,417
I was there, I heard her.

568
01:42:38,751 --> 01:42:43,626
"Because I don't want Madlyn to
suffer what I suffered at her age.”

569
01:42:49,959 --> 01:42:52,084
It's a terrible vow.

570
01:42:52,376 --> 01:42:54,917
No one has the right to make anyone
swear it.

571
01:42:57,876 --> 01:42:59,251
Perhaps.

572
01:43:00,792 --> 01:43:04,126
But as witness I stand surety for it.

573
01:43:05,917 --> 01:43:09,417
If you try to disregard it
I will stop you.

574
01:43:12,001 --> 01:43:15,792
I promised Nathalie. Her wish
will be respected.

575
01:43:34,667 --> 01:43:36,209
Let us make a vow.

576
01:43:40,042 --> 01:43:43,501
Despite my vigilance, the key to
the red cupboard is missing.

577
01:43:43,709 --> 01:43:45,334
What key?

578
01:43:45,501 --> 01:43:47,167
Have you seen it?

579
01:43:52,709 --> 01:43:57,251
- Don't hit it off, do they?
- No, something's going on.

580
01:43:58,959 --> 01:44:04,334
I'd say one is a real slut.
For my money it's the blonde.

581
01:44:04,876 --> 01:44:10,792
All that mincing affectation is
an obvious cover-up.

582
01:44:12,876 --> 01:44:17,876
Any pro will tell you that blondes
are poison.

583
01:44:18,251 --> 01:44:25,167
She's too obviously guilty
for her to be guilty really.

584
01:44:28,126 --> 01:44:30,042
Funny thinking.

585
01:44:30,376 --> 01:44:33,501
We'll let the Judgement of Solomon
decide.

586
01:44:34,042 --> 01:44:41,001
The one who ends up
with the dong wins.

587
01:44:42,042 --> 01:44:44,126
Hold on.

588
01:44:49,334 --> 01:44:51,751
He hasn't one!

589
01:44:53,917 --> 01:44:56,251
He's a girlie!

590
01:45:00,667 --> 01:45:02,667
Another one!

591
01:45:08,126 --> 01:45:11,417
Monsieur wouldn't consider
the mountains?

592
01:45:12,001 --> 01:45:16,084
Olivier, a dreadful thing
has happened.

593
01:45:21,209 --> 01:45:23,751
Do not go in there!

594
01:46:01,917 --> 01:46:04,209
Do you think it could be...

595
01:46:08,001 --> 01:46:09,501
Angèle?

596
01:46:11,876 --> 01:46:14,542
<i>But the next morning...</i>

597
01:46:32,501 --> 01:46:34,959
- I'm ill.
- Me, too.

598
01:46:35,126 --> 01:46:38,876
- I want to sleep.
- Me, too. In fact I am sleeping.

599
01:46:39,042 --> 01:46:43,542
- My legs have had it.
- Mine, too. But who's going...

600
01:46:43,709 --> 01:46:45,626
You're smart.

601
01:46:45,792 --> 01:46:48,667
Who's going to go today?

602
01:46:48,834 --> 01:46:50,584
I'm going.

603
01:46:50,751 --> 01:46:56,751
You want to go? You're dying to go,
you're there already.

604
01:46:57,334 --> 01:46:59,709
It's not worth going.

605
01:46:59,876 --> 01:47:02,209
We have to be serious.

606
01:47:03,001 --> 01:47:07,501
Let's leave it to fate.

607
01:47:08,459 --> 01:47:10,542
Have you got a coin?

608
01:47:10,792 --> 01:47:12,542
I'll look in my shoe.

609
01:47:15,792 --> 01:47:17,334
No more money.

610
01:47:18,334 --> 01:47:21,584
Be sure to give me back my change.

611
01:47:24,417 --> 01:47:26,501
I'll eat it.

612
01:47:28,084 --> 01:47:30,584
It's Swiss chocolate.

613
01:47:33,709 --> 01:47:37,209
Heads I win, tails you lose.

614
01:47:40,334 --> 01:47:41,876
Damn!

615
01:47:42,042 --> 01:47:44,126
I'm struck dumb.

616
01:47:45,334 --> 01:47:48,126
Tails. You lost.

617
01:47:48,834 --> 01:47:50,751
How odd...

618
01:47:53,751 --> 01:47:56,626
I'm going to give you...

619
01:48:00,001 --> 01:48:02,001
A little massage?

620
01:48:05,334 --> 01:48:06,584
An emblem.

621
01:48:07,417 --> 01:48:10,251
- What colour?
- Pink.

622
01:48:10,417 --> 01:48:12,084
Mauve.

623
01:48:14,167 --> 01:48:17,626
- Marshmallow.
- A lovely red.

624
01:48:20,084 --> 01:48:22,001
My little tattoo.

625
01:48:22,167 --> 01:48:24,084
What are you doing?

626
01:48:24,417 --> 01:48:26,334
A double number.

627
01:48:26,501 --> 01:48:28,584
It tickles.

628
01:48:28,834 --> 01:48:31,709
Double 33.

629
01:48:34,501 --> 01:48:36,917
Don't cough.

630
01:48:37,876 --> 01:48:40,209
What do I do with it now?

631
01:48:40,376 --> 01:48:43,501
You can go there. Take your bicycle.

632
01:48:44,542 --> 01:48:48,292
Watch out for traffic.

633
01:48:48,459 --> 01:48:53,417
If I never come back, kiss Harold
goodbye for me.

634
01:48:58,459 --> 01:49:00,709
Stop staring at me, you.

635
01:49:00,876 --> 01:49:04,251
Powder your nose, it's shiny.

636
01:49:40,542 --> 01:49:45,834
The day is composed of four parts...

637
01:49:46,001 --> 01:49:50,334
...corresponding to the four seasons
and the four weeks of the month.

638
01:49:50,792 --> 01:49:55,542
Morning, or spring, time of promise.

639
01:49:55,751 --> 01:49:58,876
Noon, or summer, period of growth.

640
01:49:59,042 --> 01:50:03,792
Afternoon, or autumn, period of
realization.

641
01:50:18,126 --> 01:50:20,751
<i>This is Guilou.</i>

642
01:50:25,667 --> 01:50:29,917
<i>Julie? I've thought a good deal.</i>

643
01:50:31,334 --> 01:50:36,167
<i>We're through, since the day
before yesterday.</i>

644
01:50:38,959 --> 01:50:42,959
Is it really Grégoire?

645
01:50:43,126 --> 01:50:47,834
<i>I've decided you wanted it this way.</i>

646
01:50:48,876 --> 01:50:52,584
Let me get a word in edgeways.

647
01:50:52,834 --> 01:50:57,626
<i>That scene in the square... it was
you who wanted it to end badly.</i>

648
01:50:59,542 --> 01:51:01,251
<i>I'm joining the Trappists.</i>

649
01:51:01,542 --> 01:51:05,792
Is this a game? You're pulling my leg.

650
01:51:05,959 --> 01:51:07,626
<i>I'm joining the Trappists.</i>

651
01:51:07,876 --> 01:51:10,917
<i>We will never talk again.</i>

652
01:51:11,084 --> 01:51:14,917
You're talking to me now.
What's on your mind?

653
01:51:15,084 --> 01:51:18,209
If you want us to break up, we will.

654
01:51:18,376 --> 01:51:20,334
<i>We've broken up already.</i>

655
01:51:20,626 --> 01:51:25,334
<i>I just want to tell you that
it's your fault.</i>

656
01:51:25,501 --> 01:51:28,251
What's my fault?

657
01:51:28,459 --> 01:51:33,292
<i>We can only say goodbye.
So, goodbye.</i>

658
01:51:40,334 --> 01:51:43,459
A Trappist!

659
01:51:56,751 --> 01:52:02,459
Oh, shit! Go masturbate among the
daisies like a Gregorian gherkin!

660
01:52:30,251 --> 01:52:34,542
<i>To my Julie. The child has
become a nun.</i>

661
01:52:55,251 --> 01:52:58,376
He's clinging on.

662
01:53:15,376 --> 01:53:21,792
<i>Properties and powers of
baby dinosaurs' eyes.</i>

663
01:53:50,584 --> 01:53:55,917
<i>The favourite food of
the baby dinosaur...</i>

664
01:53:56,167 --> 01:54:00,876
<i>...who was a fastidious gourmet,
was clover.</i>

665
01:54:02,084 --> 01:54:07,834
<i>For maximum efficiency
use the minimum...</i>

666
01:54:10,334 --> 01:54:16,542
<i>...be a little bit clever,
replace it with clover.</i>

667
01:54:29,167 --> 01:54:32,042
Beirut? Mother?

668
01:54:37,417 --> 01:54:39,751
Excuse me.

669
01:54:40,376 --> 01:54:44,792
I interfered...

670
01:54:46,792 --> 01:54:49,917
Céline? She's out.

671
01:54:55,042 --> 01:55:00,167
It is important, I can see...

672
01:55:01,376 --> 01:55:04,917
Of course, you can count on me.

673
01:55:06,501 --> 01:55:09,001
I'll tell her.

674
01:55:13,959 --> 01:55:18,459
What's this? Where's the Mandragora?
Who are you?

675
01:55:18,667 --> 01:55:24,209
Don't get excited, it makes you
twitch. The Mandragora is out.

676
01:55:24,459 --> 01:55:26,709
She gave me the scoop.

677
01:55:27,001 --> 01:55:29,334
Don't worry, I'm show people.

678
01:55:29,501 --> 01:55:32,876
- Who are you, anyway?
- Haven't you heard?

679
01:55:34,292 --> 01:55:36,876
Not heard of the Kamakaze?

680
01:55:37,417 --> 01:55:40,542
Your guy - they're going to leave.

681
01:55:41,626 --> 01:55:46,584
- Do your best. Get a move on.
- Stay cool, it's in the bag.

682
01:56:26,542 --> 01:56:32,084
Excuse the delay. Artists, you know...

683
01:56:32,792 --> 01:56:35,751
The Mandragora is money in the bag.

684
01:56:50,584 --> 01:56:53,584
<i>Naive, I'm so naive.</i>

685
01:56:53,917 --> 01:56:56,626
<i>Red-headed miss, fingers of bliss.</i>

686
01:56:56,792 --> 01:57:01,834
<i>Naive, I 'm so naive.
When I see you, sirs...</i>

687
01:57:02,751 --> 01:57:08,667
<i>...if I want to make you sigh
I light up your eyes.</i>

688
01:57:09,001 --> 01:57:14,667
<i>If! want to do more
I just lay it on.</i>

689
01:57:15,709 --> 01:57:19,876
<i>Bluestocking, that's what I am.
Shady Miss, a touch like a kiss.</i>

690
01:57:22,126 --> 01:57:26,834
<i>Bluestocking, that's what I am.
When I see you, gadzooks!</i>

691
01:58:37,667 --> 01:58:41,542
<i>I have no heart, not even for a guy.</i>

692
01:58:41,709 --> 01:58:45,292
<i>Life's played tricks on me.</i>

693
01:58:45,459 --> 01:58:49,709
<i>When I pick up a man,
I say right away...</i>

694
01:58:50,167 --> 01:58:53,292
<i>...you'll be all right with me.</i>

695
01:58:56,209 --> 01:59:01,001
<i>But when he's through the door...</i>

696
01:59:02,834 --> 01:59:08,209
<i>...old loves come back once more.</i>

697
01:59:08,917 --> 01:59:13,084
<i>And memory reappears.</i>

698
01:59:13,834 --> 01:59:18,292
<i>Like a dream.</i>

699
01:59:21,751 --> 01:59:23,584
<i>A past that is mine...</i>

700
01:59:25,042 --> 01:59:28,709
<i>...and kills me.</i>

701
01:59:45,959 --> 01:59:49,542
Excuse me, but I...

702
01:59:50,126 --> 01:59:54,126
I always let myself be overcome by...

703
01:59:54,292 --> 01:59:59,334
...irrepressible waves of feeling.

704
02:00:02,959 --> 02:00:07,251
When I was childish...

705
02:00:08,292 --> 02:00:12,084
...they told me I was a real star...

706
02:00:12,459 --> 02:00:14,084
...a shooting star...

707
02:00:17,459 --> 02:00:20,876
...and a gloating star, because...

708
02:00:22,376 --> 02:00:26,417
...I had a big rayon tutu.

709
02:00:30,834 --> 02:00:35,001
They said I was suppleness itself...

710
02:00:36,042 --> 02:00:40,584
...because I could put my legs
around my neck.

711
02:00:43,084 --> 02:00:49,959
And now I want to express my
temperament, my spontaneity.

712
02:00:53,251 --> 02:00:55,334
I'm very lively.

713
02:00:59,126 --> 02:01:03,917
And... I can do... the sweet woman...

714
02:01:05,209 --> 02:01:08,251
...and the headstand woman...

715
02:01:08,876 --> 02:01:11,459
...on my little finger...

716
02:01:12,334 --> 02:01:14,959
...and the snake woman...

717
02:01:20,751 --> 02:01:22,834
Lots of other things.

718
02:01:26,917 --> 02:01:30,917
And you, anyway, what can you do?

719
02:01:31,417 --> 02:01:35,959
Yes, show me what you can do.

720
02:01:38,709 --> 02:01:44,126
You're here, ogling me.

721
02:01:44,459 --> 02:01:47,584
Ogling every inch of me.

722
02:01:50,709 --> 02:01:54,334
Behind refrigerated glasses.

723
02:01:56,626 --> 02:02:00,417
You're not worth a bean.

724
02:02:02,417 --> 02:02:06,917
Bunch of... pimps!

725
02:02:07,792 --> 02:02:13,084
Cosmic... cosmic twilight pimps!

726
02:02:13,959 --> 02:02:17,084
Voyeurs and perverts!

727
02:02:20,667 --> 02:02:22,834
What is all this?

728
02:02:25,334 --> 02:02:28,459
Come and get me.

729
02:02:28,917 --> 02:02:32,709
Come on! I'll show you!

730
02:02:33,084 --> 02:02:38,417
Want some fun, bunch of idiots?

731
02:02:43,667 --> 02:02:46,042
Come on, let's go!

732
02:02:47,251 --> 02:02:49,584
Oh, shit!

733
02:03:02,292 --> 02:03:06,876
Wait! It's a misunderstanding!

734
02:03:11,209 --> 02:03:13,751
It's nothing really.

735
02:05:13,917 --> 02:05:16,042
Wait till I get the hairs off.

736
02:05:16,209 --> 02:05:18,542
Right, both at once.

737
02:06:08,292 --> 02:06:11,876
- Good morning, Miss Angèle.
- Good morning, Madlyn.

738
02:06:38,959 --> 02:06:41,709
But why so violent?

739
02:06:43,376 --> 02:06:45,709
These flowers are so pretty.

740
02:06:46,042 --> 02:06:48,917
I thought I'd told Mademoiselle
Camille...

741
02:06:49,084 --> 02:06:54,084
...that the sweetest scents are
odours harmful to children.

742
02:06:56,667 --> 02:06:59,001
These plants are so pretty.

743
02:07:00,626 --> 02:07:03,751
I thought I'd told Mademoiselle
Camille...

744
02:07:03,959 --> 02:07:07,334
...that the sweetest scents are
odours harmful to children.

745
02:07:07,501 --> 02:07:09,167
Do you think so?

746
02:07:10,876 --> 02:07:13,334
Pretty things do us no harm.

747
02:07:14,792 --> 02:07:16,876
If you say so...

748
02:07:26,751 --> 02:07:28,959
Mademoiselle runs risks.

749
02:07:29,792 --> 02:07:34,417
I'll leave the roses to you,
because of their thorns.

750
02:07:35,792 --> 02:07:37,876
Goodness does not always do good.

751
02:07:45,959 --> 02:07:48,126
Mademoiselle runs risks.

752
02:07:48,542 --> 02:07:53,667
I'll leave the roses to you,
because of their thorns.

753
02:07:55,751 --> 02:07:58,542
Goodness does not always do good.

754
02:08:23,959 --> 02:08:27,376
- Am I disturbing you?
- You never disturb me.

755
02:08:29,084 --> 02:08:31,167
I was thinking...

756
02:08:32,292 --> 02:08:37,876
Today is Madlyn's first birthday
since her mother died.

757
02:08:39,792 --> 02:08:42,542
And as I look so much like
my sister...

758
02:08:42,709 --> 02:08:45,001
What are you saying?

759
02:08:46,209 --> 02:08:49,167
Olivier, give me the key to my trunk.

760
02:08:51,417 --> 02:08:54,542
I do not want to see
those dresses again.

761
02:08:56,876 --> 02:09:00,626
May I please have the key
to the little red chest?

762
02:09:08,751 --> 02:09:13,292
I understand your reluctance,
but perhaps today...

763
02:09:14,751 --> 02:09:17,292
Madlyn would be so happy.

764
02:09:19,376 --> 02:09:23,876
Look at me. Nathalie's dresses
would so become me.

765
02:09:24,751 --> 02:09:27,709
How lucky that we have
the same colouring.

766
02:09:28,209 --> 02:09:31,001
I don't know what I should think.

767
02:09:33,959 --> 02:09:36,792
I thought that today perhaps...

768
02:09:36,959 --> 02:09:39,584
...at last these dresses...

769
02:09:41,834 --> 02:09:43,834
...should be mine.

770
02:09:45,209 --> 02:09:49,209
Mother left them to whichever
one of us married first.

771
02:09:49,376 --> 02:09:54,251
Since my sister's death,
they've been locked away.

772
02:09:54,959 --> 02:09:58,751
They lie languishing in the attic.

773
02:09:59,626 --> 02:10:03,126
Wrapped in mothballs and rose leaves.

774
02:10:04,917 --> 02:10:11,084
Fashions return every twenty years,
I could wear them unaltered.

775
02:10:12,126 --> 02:10:13,709
Think of Madlyn.

776
02:10:15,251 --> 02:10:17,251
How happy she would be.

777
02:10:49,542 --> 02:10:51,459
Did you sleep well?

778
02:10:52,334 --> 02:10:54,501
Today is a big day.

779
02:10:56,251 --> 02:10:58,667
I disapprove of these little games.

780
02:10:58,834 --> 02:11:01,626
Come on, be a sport.

781
02:11:03,792 --> 02:11:05,584
What a heady scent.

782
02:11:05,876 --> 02:11:07,709
It's hotting up.

783
02:11:11,459 --> 02:11:14,626
Madlyn, I've told you not to
hide under the pillow.

784
02:11:14,792 --> 02:11:17,084
What is it, Olivier?

785
02:11:21,042 --> 02:11:23,751
I've told you, the harm you do her.

786
02:11:23,917 --> 02:11:26,001
I do her no harm.

787
02:11:29,917 --> 02:11:31,917
Keep out of this, Olivier.

788
02:11:32,167 --> 02:11:33,751
She won't get him?

789
02:11:37,626 --> 02:11:41,042
Please lower your voices,
the child is resting.

790
02:11:42,917 --> 02:11:45,459
I don't know what I should think.

791
02:11:48,542 --> 02:11:50,417
Think what you like.

792
02:12:12,459 --> 02:12:14,959
See, I told you.

793
02:12:16,167 --> 02:12:19,042
But I don't believe it.

794
02:12:30,167 --> 02:12:35,542
Someone's used my syringe again.
It's unthinkable and could be dangerous.

795
02:12:37,084 --> 02:12:39,542
Madlyn's still asleep,
should we wake her?

796
02:12:39,792 --> 02:12:42,667
He does not want her to be woken.

797
02:12:42,834 --> 02:12:45,626
He has spoken to you about it?

798
02:12:46,917 --> 02:12:50,042
No, I am the one who is troubled.

799
02:12:50,834 --> 02:12:53,709
These frequent naps...

800
02:12:57,501 --> 02:13:03,376
This sleepiness is abnormal.
He claims it is hereditary.

801
02:13:04,126 --> 02:13:08,126
The scent of the plants
certainly doesn't help.

802
02:13:08,917 --> 02:13:11,709
Sophie, look what I've drawn for you.

803
02:13:22,126 --> 02:13:24,209
Did I frighten you?

804
02:13:25,667 --> 02:13:28,167
Isn't my flower pretty?

805
02:13:30,084 --> 02:13:32,167
Do not say that word.

806
02:13:56,667 --> 02:14:00,667
If you only knew the memories
that dress brings back to me.

807
02:14:00,834 --> 02:14:04,209
- The sea, the mountains?
- Both.

808
02:14:05,251 --> 02:14:07,001
The Borromean Islands?

809
02:14:07,751 --> 02:14:10,459
She's not bad, you know.

810
02:14:10,626 --> 02:14:12,792
I know, I've seen it before.

811
02:14:13,167 --> 02:14:15,501
The Kursaal orchestra.

812
02:14:18,959 --> 02:14:22,251
She was so pale, so fragile.

813
02:14:22,542 --> 02:14:23,751
More than I?

814
02:14:25,042 --> 02:14:28,084
Who? What? Is it...

815
02:14:28,751 --> 02:14:33,459
That thing. You know quite well.

816
02:14:34,667 --> 02:14:37,126
Your whims again, Sophie.

817
02:14:51,334 --> 02:14:52,376
Come with me.

818
02:14:57,084 --> 02:14:59,167
I must talk to you.

819
02:15:21,709 --> 02:15:24,167
What do you want to say?

820
02:15:24,334 --> 02:15:27,542
Nothing you don't already know,
dear Camille.

821
02:15:27,709 --> 02:15:29,542
I'm listening.

822
02:15:31,167 --> 02:15:34,042
You chose the wrong day for
trying to seduce Olivier.

823
02:15:39,334 --> 02:15:42,834
Always the same thing. I'm bored.

824
02:15:43,084 --> 02:15:47,751
But if I must repeat it all to you...

825
02:15:48,126 --> 02:15:49,917
...know that Nathalie made him swear...

826
02:15:51,417 --> 02:15:54,792
Stop. I'm having fun, it's funny.

827
02:15:54,959 --> 02:15:57,126
You can tell me later.

828
02:16:00,001 --> 02:16:01,834
Good night.

829
02:16:03,417 --> 02:16:08,792
"Because I don't want Madlyn to
suffer what I suffered at her age.”

830
02:16:13,709 --> 02:16:15,792
It's a terrible vow.

831
02:16:17,292 --> 02:16:20,084
No one has the right to make anyone
swear it.

832
02:16:20,667 --> 02:16:23,167
What a bitch!

833
02:16:38,626 --> 02:16:42,542
Despite my vigilance, the key to
the red cupboard is missing.

834
02:16:42,709 --> 02:16:44,542
What key?

835
02:16:46,292 --> 02:16:48,251
Have you seen it?

836
02:16:56,334 --> 02:17:02,334
Tied around the neck of the bottle
was a label with the words DRINK ME.

837
02:17:04,167 --> 02:17:08,334
She drank it... the liquid
inside it...

838
02:17:09,376 --> 02:17:12,126
...and became tiny.

839
02:17:15,001 --> 02:17:16,292
Mummy!

840
02:17:22,126 --> 02:17:24,209
Help me.

841
02:17:29,751 --> 02:17:31,834
Take care of her.

842
02:17:59,209 --> 02:18:05,459
Don't be afraid, why hide? That was
Camille, it wasn't your mother.

843
02:18:06,834 --> 02:18:11,001
Don't be afraid. Would you like a
sweet? I have one.

844
02:18:18,709 --> 02:18:19,709
It's over.

845
02:18:20,876 --> 02:18:24,876
I'll never be able to... she hates me.

846
02:18:25,834 --> 02:18:28,376
I'll never get her to love me.

847
02:18:30,876 --> 02:18:32,709
I am tired.

848
02:18:34,167 --> 02:18:36,709
Discouraged again.

849
02:18:36,876 --> 02:18:40,876
It's just as it was ten, fourteen
years ago.

850
02:18:41,376 --> 02:18:46,084
When Nathalie and I were young.
She never loved me, either.

851
02:18:46,834 --> 02:18:49,209
But she was so clever.

852
02:18:50,584 --> 02:18:54,751
It was never Nathalie's fault,
it was always mine.

853
02:18:56,501 --> 02:19:01,417
"Why are you so shy, Camille?
Why aren't you more like your sister?

854
02:19:01,584 --> 02:19:06,459
"You must get out. Let's go dancing,
to the theatre, to the country.”

855
02:19:06,626 --> 02:19:09,001
"Come, Camille, come.”

856
02:19:09,167 --> 02:19:11,917
She was the first to say those things.

857
02:19:12,542 --> 02:19:15,667
But I was silent and refused
everything.

858
02:19:17,917 --> 02:19:21,501
Why? Why, they wondered?

859
02:19:22,001 --> 02:19:28,084
But I knew why. I knew what was
hidden behind her kindness...

860
02:19:28,584 --> 02:19:30,667
...her compassion.

861
02:19:31,917 --> 02:19:34,001
Yes, her compassion.

862
02:19:35,959 --> 02:19:40,584
She wanted to destroy me,
to make me disappear.

863
02:19:42,667 --> 02:19:44,209
And she...

864
02:19:55,167 --> 02:19:57,084
What a shock.

865
02:19:57,251 --> 02:19:59,501
I don't see anything now.

866
02:20:01,667 --> 02:20:04,792
Let's put them back in,
see what's next.

867
02:20:04,959 --> 02:20:09,584
Wait, I want a smoke. Interval, right?

868
02:20:09,751 --> 02:20:12,542
No, I'm going on.

869
02:20:12,709 --> 02:20:14,792
You can tell me about it.

870
02:20:15,126 --> 02:20:17,751
Wait, I'm coming, too.

871
02:20:17,917 --> 02:20:20,667
Coming? Hurry.

872
02:20:49,834 --> 02:20:54,209
You are very gloomy.
I don't like seeing you like this.

873
02:20:54,376 --> 02:20:58,542
Your concern touches me, Sophie,
but I have good reason.

874
02:20:59,417 --> 02:21:03,584
- Camille's appearance upset you?
- It does not concern Camille.

875
02:21:05,042 --> 02:21:06,876
I understand.

876
02:21:08,251 --> 02:21:10,876
It's what she has awakened in you.

877
02:21:12,417 --> 02:21:18,167
Don't think of the past, think of
today, the birthday we celebrate.

878
02:21:19,209 --> 02:21:23,001
Look. The doll I bought for Madlyn.

879
02:21:23,542 --> 02:21:25,459
I'm sure she'll like it.

880
02:21:27,417 --> 02:21:33,084
What would we have done without you?
You are a second mother to her.

881
02:21:36,042 --> 02:21:38,292
Everything I've done...

882
02:21:41,251 --> 02:21:44,001
...I've done for you, too, Olivier.

883
02:21:44,709 --> 02:21:46,459
Do not forget that.

884
02:21:47,834 --> 02:21:52,792
And I hoped that you could perhaps...
that we could...

885
02:21:52,959 --> 02:21:54,792
Alas, Sophie.

886
02:22:09,626 --> 02:22:12,334
Madlyn can draw us no closer.

887
02:22:13,001 --> 02:22:17,792
But is it what you wish?
I wanted to be sure.

888
02:22:22,542 --> 02:22:27,417
Nathalie's vow... I respect it
as much as you do.

889
02:22:29,834 --> 02:22:32,292
But you will hear of it no more.

890
02:22:39,209 --> 02:22:42,792
It's not much like I thought.

891
02:22:43,376 --> 02:22:45,459
Not at all.

892
02:22:56,084 --> 02:22:58,167
How is your hand?

893
02:22:58,334 --> 02:23:01,876
Better, but I must be careful.

894
02:23:03,001 --> 02:23:05,084
Every moment brings peril.

895
02:23:36,001 --> 02:23:38,584
Happy birthday, Madlyn!

896
02:23:44,001 --> 02:23:47,959
You know, inspiration is so fragile...

897
02:23:48,917 --> 02:23:53,626
You can't refuse.
Madlyn would be so happy.

898
02:23:53,959 --> 02:23:57,084
- Please, for us.
- You are cruel.

899
02:24:07,251 --> 02:24:09,001
A sonata.

900
02:24:11,084 --> 02:24:13,167
Another sonata.

901
02:24:16,876 --> 02:24:18,292
Classy.

902
02:24:20,876 --> 02:24:23,584
No, I don't know.

903
02:24:29,834 --> 02:24:31,917
I'll begin again.

904
02:24:36,584 --> 02:24:37,959
My injured hand...

905
02:25:04,459 --> 02:25:07,334
You are so beautiful, in that red.

906
02:25:07,667 --> 02:25:11,501
You are known as the greatest catch
in New England.

907
02:25:12,542 --> 02:25:15,042
I must put my glass down.

908
02:25:20,876 --> 02:25:24,751
It's divine. I'm tipsy.

909
02:25:25,876 --> 02:25:28,167
So beautiful, in that blue.

910
02:25:30,751 --> 02:25:33,376
Hold me close.

911
02:25:36,667 --> 02:25:41,876
I lived just for you, my heart
traced your footsteps.

912
02:26:02,751 --> 02:26:04,417
Naughty girl!

913
02:26:10,001 --> 02:26:11,917
The rogue.

914
02:27:02,792 --> 02:27:06,834
A lofty tower, a bewitched prince...

915
02:27:07,001 --> 02:27:10,584
...and a tree with daggers.

916
02:27:11,292 --> 02:27:13,376
And the Blue Bird!

917
02:27:13,542 --> 02:27:17,709
- What blue bird?
- Don't you know that story?

918
02:27:18,751 --> 02:27:20,834
It's very amusing.

919
02:27:21,001 --> 02:27:24,626
An bewitched prince tries to reach
his beloved in her prison tower.

920
02:27:24,834 --> 02:27:30,876
But a wicked witch has hidden knives
and razor blades in the trees.

921
02:27:31,084 --> 02:27:33,667
The bird is wounded...

922
02:27:33,917 --> 02:27:35,417
...and bleeds.

923
02:27:35,584 --> 02:27:38,376
Stop! All that blood.

924
02:27:38,542 --> 02:27:41,376
Blood ties should be renewed.

925
02:27:48,251 --> 02:27:51,292
Must I tell this ghastly story
to its end?

926
02:27:51,459 --> 02:27:55,209
My dear friend, what you have begun
you must complete.

927
02:27:57,459 --> 02:28:00,584
Excuse me, it's time for
the child to rest.

928
02:28:29,501 --> 02:28:31,501
Madlyn, be good.

929
02:28:41,709 --> 02:28:45,292
Don't worry, my dear,
you won't be disturbed.

930
02:28:48,834 --> 02:28:53,709
I rarely have the chance to tell you...

931
02:28:53,959 --> 02:28:56,917
...how satisfied I am with
your services.

932
02:28:57,084 --> 02:28:59,792
I am duly recompensed, sir.

933
02:28:59,959 --> 02:29:03,417
Not in the way I would like.

934
02:29:06,292 --> 02:29:12,126
Madlyn is fortunate...
very fortunate...

935
02:29:19,417 --> 02:29:21,501
I've run out.

936
02:29:23,751 --> 02:29:25,917
I've finished, too.

937
02:29:31,917 --> 02:29:34,501
Madlyn is very fortunate.

938
02:29:38,167 --> 02:29:41,709
- I'm so disappointed.
- Yes, but...

939
02:29:41,876 --> 02:29:46,292
- It's just padding.
- We still don't know who did it.

940
02:29:47,334 --> 02:29:50,667
We've learned nothing more.
What do we do?

941
02:29:50,834 --> 02:29:53,334
It's full of holes.

942
02:29:53,959 --> 02:29:57,334
I don't know, it's like
Gruyere cheese.

943
02:29:57,501 --> 02:30:02,126
We don't know the end. I hate that.

944
02:30:02,792 --> 02:30:07,584
Anyway, we're not going back.
I have an idea.

945
02:30:07,917 --> 02:30:10,001
At the library...

946
02:30:12,334 --> 02:30:14,417
The library?

947
02:32:25,167 --> 02:32:27,751
Take this off, I can't stand it.

948
02:32:37,209 --> 02:32:39,417
The sun's coming up.

949
02:32:56,834 --> 02:33:02,792
<i>A return to sources both natural
and temporal...</i>

950
02:33:03,584 --> 02:33:05,667
It's the beginning.

951
02:33:07,917 --> 02:33:11,042
<i>...of the four basic elements:</i>

952
02:33:12,584 --> 02:33:14,084
<i>Water.</i>

953
02:33:31,417 --> 02:33:33,084
<i>Air.</i>

954
02:33:37,667 --> 02:33:41,251
- You don't think it's polluted?
- I don't think so.

955
02:33:41,584 --> 02:33:46,292
Very gently, it's the most
fragile part.

956
02:33:49,126 --> 02:33:52,251
You can pour it all.

957
02:33:56,542 --> 02:33:58,251
<i>Earth.</i>

958
02:33:58,417 --> 02:34:00,334
<i>Clover.</i>

959
02:34:01,459 --> 02:34:03,542
How much?

960
02:34:05,542 --> 02:34:07,292
Two stalks.

961
02:34:09,876 --> 02:34:12,501
No, two big ones.

962
02:34:13,001 --> 02:34:15,459
The same size.

963
02:34:21,251 --> 02:34:22,917
<i>Fire.</i>

964
02:34:26,042 --> 02:34:30,209
<i>The fire will shoot out from the
four cardinal points...</i>

965
02:34:32,376 --> 02:34:36,542
<i>...and from its conflagration
you will obtain...</i>

966
02:34:36,709 --> 02:34:39,834
<i>...the memory potion...</i>

967
02:34:40,792 --> 02:34:45,042
<i>...called Herbal Wine by
the ancients.</i>

968
02:34:47,376 --> 02:34:49,667
Because of the clover.

969
02:34:50,001 --> 02:34:54,501
<i>P.S. Beware of side-effects.</i>

970
02:34:54,667 --> 02:34:56,959
<i>Take in small doses.</i>

971
02:35:11,876 --> 02:35:13,959
We'll start together.

972
02:35:52,042 --> 02:35:54,667
Can Harold have some?

973
02:35:54,834 --> 02:35:57,376
Just a drop.

974
02:36:02,376 --> 02:36:04,459
He swallowed it.

975
02:36:13,001 --> 02:36:14,792
It's good.

976
02:36:14,959 --> 02:36:18,001
Very good. Some more...

977
02:36:57,167 --> 02:37:01,167
Let's have another, it's a party.

978
02:37:03,251 --> 02:37:05,417
But I feel funny.

979
02:37:06,126 --> 02:37:07,834
I feel fine.

980
02:37:08,001 --> 02:37:09,751
Really fine.

981
02:37:13,417 --> 02:37:15,501
Mademoiselle runs risks.

982
02:37:20,709 --> 02:37:22,792
Compared to the sweets...

983
02:37:28,251 --> 02:37:32,917
Someone's used my syringe again.
It's unthinkable and could be dangerous.

984
02:37:34,126 --> 02:37:37,167
Madlyn's still asleep.
Should we wake her?

985
02:37:37,376 --> 02:37:40,376
He does not want her to be woken.

986
02:37:44,459 --> 02:37:46,751
Your whims again, Sophie.

987
02:38:10,167 --> 02:38:12,792
Help me.

988
02:38:14,084 --> 02:38:15,917
Take care of her.

989
02:38:31,542 --> 02:38:36,042
I knew what was hidden behind
her kindness, her generosity.

990
02:38:39,751 --> 02:38:44,042
She shone all the brighter to the
point of blinding them all.

991
02:38:49,042 --> 02:38:53,751
She knew how to destroy me,
make me disappear...

992
02:38:55,501 --> 02:38:57,292
...stifle me.

993
02:39:00,084 --> 02:39:03,042
I had my own realm.

994
02:39:03,834 --> 02:39:08,167
It was enough. My house, my flowers...

995
02:39:09,042 --> 02:39:13,876
...my picture books, my travel books...

996
02:39:16,917 --> 02:39:19,459
...but they had to take them away.

997
02:39:22,292 --> 02:39:25,001
"Your sister's getting married.”

998
02:39:27,584 --> 02:39:29,667
"Your sister's getting married.

999
02:39:30,917 --> 02:39:34,626
"They'll come to live here,
it's logical, it's family.

1000
02:39:34,792 --> 02:39:37,501
"And they love each other.

1001
02:39:37,917 --> 02:39:41,126
"They have secrets,
they must be left alone.

1002
02:39:43,584 --> 02:39:49,209
"Wouldn't you like to travel, Camille,
see the places you've dreamed of?

1003
02:39:50,709 --> 02:39:54,334
"Borneo, Shanghai...

1004
02:39:56,084 --> 02:39:59,042
"...Macao, the Sunda Islands?”

1005
02:39:59,709 --> 02:40:04,251
With gentle words they drove me out...

1006
02:40:05,084 --> 02:40:07,876
...and with so much money...

1007
02:40:08,126 --> 02:40:14,292
...I travelled a lot,
around the world twice.

1008
02:40:16,042 --> 02:40:20,626
But it was as if another was doing it.

1009
02:40:22,792 --> 02:40:28,001
Only at night was it I.

1010
02:40:29,584 --> 02:40:31,667
In my dreams.

1011
02:40:32,542 --> 02:40:37,042
Always the same dream,
the same house.

1012
02:40:38,251 --> 02:40:40,084
My house.

1013
02:40:40,876 --> 02:40:45,042
Now she's dead. I'm alive. Free.

1014
02:40:45,459 --> 02:40:47,542
<i>And it's my house.</i>

1015
02:40:48,667 --> 02:40:51,292
They won't drive me out again.

1016
02:40:52,584 --> 02:40:54,751
I'll do anything.

1017
02:40:57,542 --> 02:40:59,459
Anything.

1018
02:41:02,209 --> 02:41:05,709
The child will have to give in,
don't you think?

1019
02:41:09,167 --> 02:41:11,251
And blood ties?

1020
02:41:14,042 --> 02:41:17,834
They must be more important
than everything else.

1021
02:41:18,876 --> 02:41:22,001
They must be renewed.

1022
02:41:32,417 --> 02:41:34,084
They must.

1023
02:41:36,417 --> 02:41:38,667
Don't you think so, Angèle?

1024
02:42:00,542 --> 02:42:03,667
Why do you never answer, Angèle?

1025
02:42:23,542 --> 02:42:26,667
I have to recover, give me some more.

1026
02:43:07,834 --> 02:43:10,167
Blood ties must be renewed.

1027
02:43:27,959 --> 02:43:30,834
My head aches.

1028
02:43:32,834 --> 02:43:35,334
Everything's spinning.

1029
02:43:38,126 --> 02:43:43,334
Julie, I see you here... and there...

1030
02:43:45,084 --> 02:43:48,876
Why are you behind my back? There.

1031
02:43:50,001 --> 02:43:52,376
- Where?
- There.

1032
02:44:04,584 --> 02:44:07,709
Harold's tipsy, too.

1033
02:44:13,209 --> 02:44:15,709
Madlyn, be a good girl.

1034
02:44:21,959 --> 02:44:25,709
Don't worry, my dear,
you won't be disturbed.

1035
02:44:32,792 --> 02:44:37,751
Miss Angèle, I rarely have the
chance to tell you...

1036
02:44:38,209 --> 02:44:41,126
...how satisfied I am with
your services.

1037
02:44:41,334 --> 02:44:43,667
I am duly recompensed, sir.

1038
02:44:44,959 --> 02:44:48,001
Not in the way I would like.

1039
02:44:51,917 --> 02:44:56,084
Madlyn is so lucky to enjoy
your constant care.

1040
02:44:56,334 --> 02:44:58,917
Could Monsieur make propositions...

1041
02:45:00,084 --> 02:45:02,167
...that are more precise?

1042
02:45:02,751 --> 02:45:08,417
I had thought of taking Madlyn to
the sea. You could come with us.

1043
02:45:08,751 --> 02:45:14,667
Impossible! The mere sight of a fish
gives me amnesia.

1044
02:45:16,292 --> 02:45:20,459
Monsieur wouldn't consider
the mountains?

1045
02:45:25,334 --> 02:45:28,001
A dreadful thing has happened.

1046
02:45:32,167 --> 02:45:34,876
Do not go in there!

1047
02:45:40,917 --> 02:45:45,334
<i>You are quite mysterious,
my dear friend.</i>

1048
02:45:45,959 --> 02:45:51,167
<i>Your concern touches me, my sweet.</i>

1049
02:45:51,417 --> 02:45:57,126
<i>But I have reasons for this mystery.
Both our lives depend on it.</i>

1050
02:45:57,834 --> 02:46:01,917
<i>Has my coming troubled you?</i>

1051
02:46:06,167 --> 02:46:08,251
It's my turn.

1052
02:46:14,417 --> 02:46:18,251
<i>Your arrival awoke in me...</i>

1053
02:46:18,417 --> 02:46:22,834
<i>...another world that slumbered.</i>

1054
02:46:23,459 --> 02:46:26,584
<i>What you've done,
we've done together.</i>

1055
02:46:26,751 --> 02:46:30,042
<i>We have given birth to night.</i>

1056
02:46:34,709 --> 02:46:39,084
<i>What would I do without you?
I hope...</i>

1057
02:46:40,292 --> 02:46:42,792
<i>...that we might still gather...</i>

1058
02:46:43,042 --> 02:46:47,042
<i>...the stars of the Thousand
and One Nights.</i>

1059
02:46:47,417 --> 02:46:53,459
<i>I couldn't have done what I've done
but for your presence, my sweet.</i>

1060
02:46:54,709 --> 02:46:58,167
<i>This monstrous child...</i>

1061
02:47:03,042 --> 02:47:08,251
<i>Will you not reproach me for it
some day?</i>

1062
02:47:09,001 --> 02:47:14,834
<i>My sweet, nothing could
bring us closer.</i>

1063
02:47:17,001 --> 02:47:20,459
<i>My darling.</i>

1064
02:47:23,251 --> 02:47:26,626
<i>I wanted to hear you say it.</i>

1065
02:47:26,792 --> 02:47:31,167
<i>Our desires will crystallize
together.</i>

1066
02:47:35,334 --> 02:47:38,459
- I'm scared.
- Me, too.

1067
02:47:40,001 --> 02:47:44,417
- But we have no choice.
- We must do something.

1068
02:47:44,584 --> 02:47:47,084
- Let's go.
- We have to save her.

1069
02:47:47,459 --> 02:47:52,834
If we never come back,
what would we do?

1070
02:47:53,042 --> 02:47:56,167
Happily, we've still got...

1071
02:47:56,334 --> 02:47:59,459
...dinosaur eyes and clover.

1072
02:47:59,626 --> 02:48:02,584
We must save the kid at all costs.

1073
02:48:03,084 --> 02:48:07,626
- I want to get her out.
- We'll get her out.

1074
02:48:08,667 --> 02:48:12,626
We'll get her out,
but we can still be scared.

1075
02:48:12,834 --> 02:48:16,709
We can sleep, too, even if
we're scared.

1076
02:48:17,501 --> 02:48:21,667
I don't want to sleep,
I might dream if I sleep.

1077
02:48:26,542 --> 02:48:29,126
Everything's spinning.

1078
02:48:32,251 --> 02:48:34,959
I can't sleep.

1079
02:48:47,792 --> 02:48:50,501
I laugh when I'm afraid.

1080
02:48:52,126 --> 02:48:57,001
Me, too, when I'm sick.
I feel sick to my stomach.

1081
02:48:58,917 --> 02:49:01,001
Once upon a time...

1082
02:49:02,792 --> 02:49:04,917
Twice upon a time...

1083
02:49:05,084 --> 02:49:07,501
Thrice upon a time...

1084
02:49:08,292 --> 02:49:14,292
Only this time... it won't be
like that.

1085
02:49:15,126 --> 02:49:18,251
Not like the other times.

1086
02:49:18,709 --> 02:49:21,834
We'll get her.

1087
02:49:24,084 --> 02:49:26,792
Stop the engines.

1088
02:49:27,042 --> 02:49:29,876
<i>But the next morning...</i>

1089
02:50:06,251 --> 02:50:08,542
We've got here too early.

1090
02:50:09,917 --> 02:50:12,001
Time for a smoke.

1091
02:50:23,542 --> 02:50:25,876
- Clever.
- Clover.

1092
02:50:26,042 --> 02:50:28,251
- Clover.
- Clever.

1093
02:51:05,917 --> 02:51:08,167
First round to us.

1094
02:51:10,501 --> 02:51:12,001
I can't see straight.

1095
02:51:12,167 --> 02:51:13,709
Where?

1096
02:51:13,876 --> 02:51:16,751
Don't try to be clover.

1097
02:51:17,084 --> 02:51:19,459
Up the stairs!

1098
02:51:34,709 --> 02:51:36,626
A real morgue.

1099
02:51:36,792 --> 02:51:39,501
We'll run into stuffed ghosts.

1100
02:51:39,751 --> 02:51:41,834
What do we do?

1101
02:51:55,709 --> 02:51:58,251
You change, I'm going in.

1102
02:52:03,042 --> 02:52:05,709
You look like some crazy oyster-bird.

1103
02:52:06,584 --> 02:52:09,459
You think you're so clover.

1104
02:52:10,917 --> 02:52:16,459
I'll brighten your façade,
make oranges grow on an olive tree.

1105
02:52:21,251 --> 02:52:25,584
Miss... Angèle... Terre.

1106
02:52:26,709 --> 02:52:30,459
Mys.. tery... Angèle.

1107
02:52:31,167 --> 02:52:33,251
What do you mean?

1108
02:52:35,042 --> 02:52:39,501
- This woman's a drag queen.
- No, a defrocked nun.

1109
02:52:40,542 --> 02:52:44,709
Everything's spinning... my God!

1110
02:52:46,501 --> 02:52:49,709
Take a swig from the flask.

1111
02:52:52,584 --> 02:52:57,876
Time's spinning, too. I'll be late
for the camomile scene.

1112
02:52:58,042 --> 02:52:59,792
Here, take this.

1113
02:53:07,501 --> 02:53:10,751
Eye of lynx and wooden head.

1114
02:53:14,917 --> 02:53:17,001
I've forgotten my lines.

1115
02:53:19,917 --> 02:53:23,042
I thought I'd already told you...

1116
02:53:24,084 --> 02:53:28,792
...that the finest scents are
the best perfumes.

1117
02:55:30,251 --> 02:55:32,417
I've forgotten.

1118
02:55:39,084 --> 02:55:42,834
You could lose, but you always win.

1119
02:55:43,001 --> 02:55:44,917
You know it is forbidden her.

1120
02:55:45,084 --> 02:55:48,709
Madlyn, I've told you not to
hide under the pillow.

1121
02:55:49,667 --> 02:55:52,792
What do you mean? I don't understand.

1122
02:55:52,959 --> 02:55:56,376
- The harm you do her.
- I do no harm.

1123
02:55:57,209 --> 02:55:59,126
Keep out of this, Olivier.

1124
02:55:59,292 --> 02:56:02,959
I know better than you how to handle
her, eight months I've cared for her.

1125
02:56:05,751 --> 02:56:09,917
Let me decide. I know better
than you what I'm doing.

1126
02:56:11,876 --> 02:56:14,917
May I please have the key
to the red chest?

1127
02:56:15,876 --> 02:56:18,376
I don't know what I should think.

1128
02:57:00,084 --> 02:57:02,834
It's taking off.

1129
02:57:10,501 --> 02:57:13,459
I'm not a bit clover.

1130
02:57:14,501 --> 02:57:18,834
I let the silence in.
I mean, I mixed up two scenes.

1131
02:57:19,001 --> 02:57:23,501
- We've had it, they'll be on to us.
- They didn't notice.

1132
02:57:26,376 --> 02:57:33,251
And you, Miss Terre, have you some
juicy secrets to tell us?

1133
02:57:35,501 --> 02:57:38,459
Imagine, my dear.

1134
02:57:38,626 --> 02:57:44,709
I glimpsed Camille in the attic
rummaging in her things.

1135
02:57:44,876 --> 02:57:47,834
Did she say hello?

1136
02:57:48,001 --> 02:57:51,542
I sneezed. She didn't react.

1137
02:57:55,542 --> 02:57:58,251
They're up to their necks in this.

1138
02:57:58,417 --> 02:58:02,667
Act Two is about to begin.

1139
02:58:03,167 --> 02:58:05,251
See if the coast is clear.

1140
03:00:15,751 --> 03:00:18,417
Someone's used my syringe again.

1141
03:00:19,917 --> 03:00:23,542
It's incomprehensible and
totally shocking...

1142
03:00:24,834 --> 03:00:28,667
Is Madlyn still asleep,
should we wake her?

1143
03:00:29,001 --> 03:00:33,251
But he, caught between two fires...
Let her sleep.

1144
03:00:33,459 --> 03:00:37,084
He has spoken to you?
Has he said something to you?

1145
03:00:37,251 --> 03:00:41,792
No, it's me... I'm getting stuck...
these...

1146
03:00:41,959 --> 03:00:47,001
...these whiffs of... it's stifling.

1147
03:00:47,334 --> 03:00:50,959
Well, the scent of these plants
doesn't help things.

1148
03:00:51,167 --> 03:00:53,751
Sophie, look what I've drawn for you.

1149
03:01:02,792 --> 03:01:05,751
Excuse me, I didn't mean to
frighten you.

1150
03:01:06,792 --> 03:01:08,876
Isn't my flower pretty?

1151
03:01:09,042 --> 03:01:11,126
She's the mur... der... ess!

1152
03:01:21,376 --> 03:01:25,542
The bitch! Tea without sugar!

1153
03:01:40,876 --> 03:01:43,417
I didn't know I was so emotional.

1154
03:01:43,584 --> 03:01:48,459
The bastards! They didn't even
offer me champagne.

1155
03:01:50,334 --> 03:01:52,167
It's not funny.

1156
03:01:52,792 --> 03:01:56,084
Well, I've won our bet.

1157
03:01:57,834 --> 03:02:00,584
We'll discuss it when we're
through with this.

1158
03:02:02,334 --> 03:02:04,584
I thought I was done for.

1159
03:02:05,126 --> 03:02:09,292
Whether it's Sophie or Camille
makes no difference.

1160
03:02:09,459 --> 03:02:11,584
We'll continue as planned.

1161
03:02:15,251 --> 03:02:18,292
Help me.

1162
03:02:18,834 --> 03:02:21,959
Take care of her.

1163
03:03:01,959 --> 03:03:07,417
Do not hide under the pillow.
Don't be afraid.

1164
03:03:08,667 --> 03:03:12,834
It wasn't your mother,
it was Camille.

1165
03:03:13,667 --> 03:03:15,584
Do you want a sweet?

1166
03:03:17,251 --> 03:03:20,709
I have one here for you.

1167
03:03:22,209 --> 03:03:24,292
Open your mouth.

1168
03:03:27,417 --> 03:03:29,501
You'll sleep now.

1169
03:03:33,917 --> 03:03:38,001
My house, my garden, my flowers.

1170
03:03:39,459 --> 03:03:42,001
My travel books... I'm going to swoon.

1171
03:03:43,626 --> 03:03:46,917
It would have been enough...

1172
03:03:47,084 --> 03:03:50,584
"Your sister's getting married.

1173
03:03:51,167 --> 03:03:57,084
"They'll come to live here, it's
logical. They'll love each other.”

1174
03:04:00,042 --> 03:04:03,667
Lily-livered. Drink some potion.

1175
03:04:04,626 --> 03:04:09,084
"Wouldn't you like to travel, Camille,
see the places you've dreamed of?

1176
03:04:09,251 --> 03:04:13,584
"Shanghai, Macao, the Sunda Islands,
Borneo.”

1177
03:04:14,167 --> 03:04:19,126
They gave me gentle words and
money, lots of money.

1178
03:04:19,917 --> 03:04:22,001
I went around the world twice.

1179
03:04:34,667 --> 03:04:38,667
You're late. I've been waiting
for two minutes.

1180
03:04:38,834 --> 03:04:43,251
I had to answer a call of nature,
I'm not made of clover.

1181
03:04:45,001 --> 03:04:48,667
Anyway, don't worry, they won't
get us now.

1182
03:05:59,126 --> 03:06:03,667
Eye of lynx, we've got it made.

1183
03:06:17,001 --> 03:06:21,876
You are known as the greatest catch
in New England.

1184
03:06:22,292 --> 03:06:25,334
You're so beautiful, in that red.

1185
03:06:25,542 --> 03:06:28,459
You are so pallid, in that black.

1186
03:06:29,084 --> 03:06:32,042
I must put my glass down.

1187
03:06:37,001 --> 03:06:39,084
It's divine. I'm tipsy.

1188
03:06:39,251 --> 03:06:41,334
We're not in a melo any more.

1189
03:07:59,042 --> 03:08:01,542
Eeny, meeny, miny, mo!

1190
03:08:02,292 --> 03:08:05,001
Oh, great clover, it's your turn!

1191
03:08:31,376 --> 03:08:34,251
Excuse me, it's time for
the child's nap.

1192
03:08:41,876 --> 03:08:44,084
You'd lost your talisman.

1193
03:08:45,126 --> 03:08:47,876
Not that way, follow me.

1194
03:09:14,001 --> 03:09:15,542
Put your leg here.

1195
03:09:17,209 --> 03:09:18,792
Wait.

1196
03:09:22,084 --> 03:09:23,834
Together now.

1197
03:09:38,126 --> 03:09:42,209
It doesn't hurt to fall off the moon.

1198
03:09:42,417 --> 03:09:44,501
But we failed again.

1199
03:09:45,709 --> 03:09:48,209
The dinosaurs took back their eyes.

1200
03:10:05,334 --> 03:10:07,417
What shall we play now?

1201
03:10:07,667 --> 03:10:11,584
No more playing, ever.

1202
03:10:12,417 --> 03:10:16,501
We're going out.
We'll take you boating.

1203
03:11:11,542 --> 03:11:13,459
Got a smoke?

1204
03:12:42,626 --> 03:12:45,751
You've dropped your squirrel.
