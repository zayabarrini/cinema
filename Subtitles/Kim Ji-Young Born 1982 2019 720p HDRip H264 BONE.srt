1
00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.001
A cloud is over from the west

2
00:01:07.005 --> 00:01:11.169
Snow sleet in the central region

3
00:01:11.176 --> 00:01:12.837
But in the morning

4
00:01:12.844 --> 00:01:16.837
But some people will say that the problem is solved first

5
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.343
Would be better hope you all have a good day

6
00:01:23.354 --> 00:01:25.515
One more story

7
00:01:25.523 --> 00:01:27.514
I have been flying in the universe

8
00:01:41.206 --> 00:01:42.537
mom

9
00:01:46.377 --> 00:01:47.878
mom

10
00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:06.561
Hello there

11
00:02:09.067 --> 00:02:11.058
I don't know why

12
00:02:15.406 --> 00:02:19.900
That is not me

13
00:02:19.911 --> 00:02:21.572
It's my wife

14
00:02:22.247 --> 00:02:24.738
Then your wife must come in person

15
00:02:26.584 --> 00:02:29.747
I want to know first

16
00:02:38.596 --> 00:02:40.427
Ah Young

17
00:02:40.431 --> 00:02:41.762
Dear what's wrong

18
00:02:42.433 --> 00:02:43.764
do not know

19
00:02:45.103 --> 00:02:46.934
Don't you like it

20
00:02:46.938 --> 00:02:48.769
Didn't you go to the cram school?

21
00:02:48.773 --> 00:02:50.434
is it

22
00:02:50.441 --> 00:02:51.772
very scary

23
00:02:52.944 --> 00:02:56.277
Good luck

24
00:02:56.281 --> 00:02:57.612
Will hear

25
00:02:58.783 --> 00:03:00.284
So envious

26
00:03:00.285 --> 00:03:01.616
I also want to use the money my husband made

27
00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:03.951
Buy coffee and drink

28
00:03:03.955 --> 00:03:05.946
Then you marry

29
00:03:05.957 --> 00:03:08.949
You talked a little bit.

30
00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.291
I find it too difficult to go to work recently

31
00:03:10.295 --> 00:03:11.785
Or get married

32
00:03:11.796 --> 00:03:13.627
Aren't there Minister Kim?

33
00:03:13.631 --> 00:03:16.464
really

34
00:03:18.303 --> 00:03:20.134
mom

35
00:03:20.138 --> 00:03:22.129
Yes, mother will come

36
00:03:24.142 --> 00:03:25.973
mom

37
00:03:25.977 --> 00:03:27.968


38
00:03:28.646 --> 00:03:30.978


39
00:03:31.816 --> 00:03:32.805
Reason

40
00:03:32.817 --> 00:03:35.149
Well done, Ah Young.

41
00:03:35.987 --> 00:03:36.976
Here is dad

42
00:03:36.988 --> 00:03:37.977
father

43
00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:39.650
Hurry up and wash out

44
00:03:39.657 --> 00:03:40.817
Uh uh

45
00:03:43.161 --> 00:03:44.992
I want to bathe her

46
00:03:44.996 --> 00:03:45.985
Thanks

47
00:03:45.997 --> 00:03:47.487
You didn't eat dinner

48
00:03:50.668 --> 00:03:52.829
Here is dad

49
00:03:53.838 --> 00:03:54.998
Dad will bathe you

50
00:03:55.006 --> 00:03:55.995
Ok

51
00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:09.508
Did not take yours

52
00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.351
I'm fine, Oppa.

53
00:04:12.357 --> 00:04:13.847
Hurry up

54
00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:20.861
How is your wrist?

55
00:04:20.865 --> 00:04:22.696
Just use it too much

56
00:04:23.534 --> 00:04:25.525
Do you know what is really sad

57
00:04:25.536 --> 00:04:28.369
The doctor said that the rice is made with a rice cooker

58
00:04:28.373 --> 00:04:29.533
Clothes are washed in a washing machine

59
00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.531
Why does it hurt? Ask me like that

60
00:04:31.542 --> 00:04:32.873
really? Eat it all

61
00:04:32.877 --> 00:04:34.208
Are company employees easy because of the electronic products?

62
00:04:34.212 --> 00:04:35.372
Does work become easy?

63
00:04:36.214 --> 00:04:37.203
Yes

64
00:04:37.215 --> 00:04:39.376
Everything can make me sad lately

65
00:04:39.384 --> 00:04:40.874
Really strange. This one

66
00:04:42.053 --> 00:04:43.884
That is not strange

67
00:04:43.888 --> 00:04:46.379
Why does it hurt to talk to someone who hurts?

68
00:04:46.391 --> 00:04:47.551
This

69
00:04:47.558 --> 00:04:47.717

70
00:04:50.895 --> 00:04:51.054 

71
00:04:51.062 --> 00:04:51.221


72
00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:51.388


73
00:04:51.396 --> 00:04:51.555


74
00:04:51.562 --> 00:04:51.721


75
00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:51.888


76
00:04:56.234 --> 00:04:59.897
Let's go on a holiday

77
00:05:00.738 --> 00:05:02.399
Don't go to my house or your house

78
00:05:02.407 --> 00:05:04.568
Do you want to rest at home?

79
00:05:04.575 --> 00:05:06.406
I'm so tired recently

80
00:05:06.411 --> 00:05:08.572
Do you want to be trained by mother?

81
00:05:08.579 --> 00:05:11.070
And the person who works is me, not you

82
00:05:11.082 --> 00:05:13.073
It ’s not just this holiday season

83
00:05:13.084 --> 00:05:14.574
I'm really tired

84
00:05:14.585 --> 00:05:16.246
The thought of driving to Busan

85
00:05:16.254 --> 00:05:17.744
It's dark before me

86
00:05:20.258 --> 00:05:22.249
How good to say earlier

87
00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.919
What?

88
00:05:22.927 --> 00:05:24.918
I said when I was newly married 

89
00:05:24.929 --> 00:05:27.090
Every time my parents’ birthday passes,

90
00:05:27.098 --> 00:05:29.589
Every time the festival passes, it will be a bit tired

91
00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.591
When you said that two or three times a year would be fine.


92
00:05:31.602 --> 00:05:33.103
How can I do this?

93
00:05:33.104 --> 00:05:34.765
I still say this

94
00:05:34.772 --> 00:05:36.763
Didn't I go when I was pregnant?


95
00:05:38.609 --> 00:05:39.940
And if you don’t go

96
00:05:39.944 --> 00:05:41.445
Who would be gossiped

97
00:05:41.446 --> 00:05:42.936
Can you blame your own son

98
00:05:42.947 --> 00:05:44.448
They will blame me 

99
00:05:45.283 --> 00:05:46.272


100
00:05:48.119 --> 00:05:49.609
mom

101
00:05:51.622 --> 00:05:53.283

102
00:05:54.125 --> 00:05:55.786
Today is the first day of the Spring Festival holiday

103
00:05:55.793 --> 00:05:58.125
Roads are clear in most areas

104
00:05:58.129 --> 00:06:00.620
Better road condition than last year

105
00:06:00.631 --> 00:06:05.125
The long vacation lasted five days, so the traffic flow was dispersed.

106
00:06:05.136 --> 00:06:09.129
This Spring Festival Expressway

107
00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:11.472
After finishing these, make dumplings.

108
00:06:11.476 --> 00:06:13.307
Yes

109
00:06:13.311 --> 00:06:15.472
Why is there so much 

110
00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:16.640
Doing dumpling business

111
00:06:16.647 --> 00:06:18.308
Who can finish eating?

112
00:06:18.316 --> 00:06:19.305
What's wrong with you

113
00:06:19.317 --> 00:06:20.477
Making fuss 

114
00:06:20.485 --> 00:06:23.318
Recently, holiday takeaways are also selling very well.

115
00:06:23.321 --> 00:06:24.982
It tastes good too

116
00:06:24.989 --> 00:06:27.651
The family eats together once a year

117
00:06:27.658 --> 00:06:29.649
Is it necessary to order takeaway

118
00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:31.992
No, I'm afraid you will be affected.

119
00:06:32.497 --> 00:06:35.330
Are you worried about me 

120
00:06:40.338 --> 00:06:41.828
A lot of dishes  to wash

121
00:06:48.346 --> 00:06:49.506
Let me do it

122
00:06:49.514 --> 00:06:50.674
Go and wait

123
00:06:50.681 --> 00:06:55.516
My daughter-in-law really has a good husband.

124
00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:58.011
Mom, I make it at home

125
00:06:58.022 --> 00:06:59.853
I didn't say anything

126
00:06:59.857 --> 00:07:02.519
I said my son was handsome and I didn’t say anything to you

127
00:07:02.527 --> 00:07:04.017
Not that

128
00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:06.360
Mom, you should have more sons.

129
00:07:06.364 --> 00:07:08.696
Then there will be another daughter-in-law

130
00:07:08.699 --> 00:07:11.691
Dad, what are you doing? No more fuel?

131
00:07:12.537 --> 00:07:15.529
Kick the accelerator down

132
00:07:16.707 --> 00:07:18.538
Is this kid crazy

133
00:07:20.211 --> 00:07:23.874
Are you looking for an uncle?

134
00:07:25.049 --> 00:07:26.880

135
00:07:26.884 --> 00:07:28.875
What happened to you two today

136
00:07:59.417 --> 00:08:00.907
Mom

137
00:08:00.918 --> 00:08:03.409
Why don't you sleep more

138
00:08:04.589 --> 00:08:05.920
I got enough sleep

139
00:08:11.929 --> 00:08:14.090
Mom, do you have to cook all spinach?

140
00:08:14.098 --> 00:08:15.087
Yeah

141
00:08:16.434 --> 00:08:19.096
Ah I have something to give you

142
00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:25.101
I don't know if you like it or not

143
00:08:25.109 --> 00:08:26.770
Mom, what is this?

144
00:08:36.454 --> 00:08:39.446
Mom is so pretty.

145
00:08:39.457 --> 00:08:41.118


146
00:08:41.125 --> 00:08:42.786
Do you like patterns?

147
00:08:42.793 --> 00:08:45.956
I have a long queue to buy this.

148
00:08:45.963 --> 00:08:47.794
Thank you

149
00:09:11.489 --> 00:09:13.150
This is Ah Young's friend, Bolubu. 

150
00:09:16.994 --> 00:09:19.656

151
00:09:25.002 --> 00:09:26.993
Isn't it hot?

152
00:09:27.838 --> 00:09:28.998
Don't scorch

153
00:09:29.006 --> 00:09:32.498
Grandpa, look at this

154
00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:33.670
The luggage is packed and dry

155
00:09:33.678 --> 00:09:35.009
Hurry up after finishing this

156
00:09:35.012 --> 00:09:36.343
Okay, let's go first.

157
00:09:41.352 --> 00:09:43.513
Mother-in-law, here we are.

158
00:09:43.521 --> 00:09:45.182
Hurry up hurry up

159
00:09:45.189 --> 00:09:45.348

160
00:09:45.356 --> 00:09:45.515
Grandmother

161
00:09:45.523 --> 00:09:45.682

162
00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:45.849

163
00:09:45.856 --> 00:09:46.015

164
00:09:46.023 --> 00:09:46.182

165
00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:46.349

166
00:09:46.357 --> 00:09:46.516

167
00:09:46.524 --> 00:09:46.683

168
00:09:46.691 --> 00:09:46.850

169
00:09:46.857 --> 00:09:47.016
Grandmother

170
00:09:48.359 --> 00:09:48.518
Bought something on the way

171
00:09:48.526 --> 00:09:48.685

172
00:09:48.693 --> 00:09:48.852
I bought some on the way

173
00:09:48.859 --> 00:09:49.018

174
00:09:49.026 --> 00:09:49.185

175
00:09:49.193 --> 00:09:49.352

176
00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:51.191

177
00:09:51.195 --> 00:09:53.527
You can spend a lot of time exhausted

178
00:09:53.531 --> 00:09:55.362
Come in fast

179
00:09:55.366 --> 00:09:56.856
I'm afraid you are leaving

180
00:09:56.867 --> 00:09:57.196
Why do you buy so much?

181
00:09:57.201 --> 00:09:59.533

182
00:09:59.537 --> 00:10:02.529
Isn't a family reunion a festival?

183
00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:06.374
Ah Young Ah Young

184
00:10:06.377 --> 00:10:09.210
Like look at this. Look at this

185
00:10:09.213 --> 00:10:12.205
Oh my god

186
00:10:12.216 --> 00:10:14.207
When did you buy it?

187
00:10:14.218 --> 00:10:15.719
Just bought some

188
00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:17.210
What else

189
00:10:17.221 --> 00:10:19.052
it's beautiful

190
00:10:20.224 --> 00:10:22.556
Oh my god

191
00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:24.721
A daughter is the best

192
00:10:24.729 --> 00:10:25.559
Yes yes

193
00:10:25.563 --> 00:10:27.394
it's beautiful

194
00:10:27.398 --> 00:10:30.390
We are so happy.

195
00:10:30.401 --> 00:10:33.234
Aunt bought so many beautiful clothes

196
00:10:36.407 --> 00:10:37.738
She's still the cutest.

197
00:10:37.742 --> 00:10:39.232
Of course, she is so cute

198
00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:44.571
Mother-in-law, you know

199
00:10:44.582 --> 00:10:46.743
You are still the best

200
00:10:46.751 --> 00:10:48.412
You must have very tired today

201
00:10:48.419 --> 00:10:50.910
Yes, I did a lot

202
00:10:50.921 --> 00:10:52.912
By the way, make some oil cakes

203
00:10:52.923 --> 00:10:54.914
Bring chopsticks, spoon and scissors

204
00:10:54.925 --> 00:10:57.257
Mom, I can get it myself

205
00:10:57.261 --> 00:11:00.253
You're not at your in-laws.

206
00:11:00.264 --> 00:11:06.437
Ji Young, you are tired, come back to rest.

207
00:11:06.437 --> 00:11:07.267
Mom, I bought it well, right?

208
00:11:07.271 --> 00:11:10.263
Yes, it ’s great.

209
00:11:10.274 --> 00:11:12.105
Oh my princess, little princess, yeah

210
00:11:14.278 --> 00:11:16.109
My granddaughter is so cute

211
00:11:16.947 --> 00:11:18.107

212
00:11:18.616 --> 00:11:20.447
You deserve to be my granddaughter

213
00:11:20.451 --> 00:11:22.942
Pretty pretty

214
00:11:23.621 --> 00:11:26.112
Mom, honestly, do you miss me more or Da Hyung more?

215
00:11:26.123 --> 00:11:27.624
What are you talking about

216
00:11:29.126 --> 00:11:30.787
that's it

217
00:11:30.795 --> 00:11:32.626
I know

218
00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:33.961
mother-in-law

219
00:11:38.135 --> 00:11:42.299
Really want me to rest, just let me go home

220
00:11:43.307 --> 00:11:45.298
Isn't this what it should be?

221
00:11:45.309 --> 00:11:48.142
My mother will want to see her daughter happy at the festival, right?

222
00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:51.641
I also want to see my daughter

223
00:11:53.317 --> 00:11:55.478
What does this child say

224
00:11:55.486 --> 00:11:58.649
Since your daughter is here

225
00:11:58.656 --> 00:12:00.647
And let my daughter go.

226
00:12:00.658 --> 00:12:01.818
This

227
00:12:01.826 --> 00:12:04.317
You have to take care of your in-laws and leave.

228
00:12:04.328 --> 00:12:07.320
How sad should my family be?

229
00:12:07.331 --> 00:12:10.494
Ah Young, what are you doing?

230
00:12:10.501 --> 00:12:12.162
In-laws

231
00:12:12.837 --> 00:12:15.169
I am also a daughter

232
00:12:17.174 --> 00:12:20.337
This is for a reason, I will explain to you later

233
00:12:26.851 --> 00:12:28.011
This

234
00:12:37.361 --> 00:12:39.522
Oppa, I'm going to the bathroom

235
00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:41.691
Is it still far from the service area?

236
00:12:43.033 --> 00:12:45.194
I will stop at the next service area

237
00:12:48.038 --> 00:12:50.529
Ji Young is a little bit

238
00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:55.041
Not very uncomfortable

239
00:12:55.546 --> 00:12:58.538
Don't let mom call Ji Young.

240
00:12:58.549 --> 00:13:00.210
Oh got it

241
00:13:01.385 --> 00:13:04.718
Oh my god

242
00:13:04.722 --> 00:13:06.883
Can I help?

243
00:13:06.891 --> 00:13:08.222
No need

244
00:13:09.393 --> 00:13:11.725
Just don't let mom call

245
00:13:11.729 --> 00:13:12.889
Understood

246
00:13:12.897 --> 00:13:14.228
I will live in vain

247
00:13:14.231 --> 00:13:17.894
We care too little about Ji Young

248
00:13:17.902 --> 00:13:19.062
What should I do

249
00:13:19.069 --> 00:13:20.900
It's okay, no problem

250
00:13:20.905 --> 00:13:21.564
Bye

251
00:13:21.572 --> 00:13:23.062
Oh, I see

252
00:13:28.746 --> 00:13:30.737
How much longer

253
00:13:30.748 --> 00:13:32.579
Mom must be waiting.

254
00:13:35.586 --> 00:13:38.419
Are you tired?

255
00:13:38.422 --> 00:13:40.413
No, I miss mom

256
00:13:55.105 --> 00:13:57.096
We are so good

257
00:13:57.107 --> 00:13:59.098
Do you miss grandma

258
00:14:01.445 --> 00:14:04.608
Eun Young, get some rice wine for Mr. Jung

259
00:14:04.615 --> 00:14:05.946
Jiseok

260
00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:08.783
What did you ask me to do?

261
00:14:08.786 --> 00:14:10.117
I can get it myself

262
00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:11.951
No, I don't

263
00:14:11.956 --> 00:14:13.287
Jiseok

264
00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:14.951
Kim Eun Young. Kim Eun Young

265
00:14:17.127 --> 00:14:20.290
Brother-in-law, you know
How tired is it to be a man in this home?

266
00:14:20.297 --> 00:14:25.633
Hello, think about you. Since 1988,
you are enjoying the benefits

267
00:14:25.636 --> 00:14:28.628
That's me, but my son

268
00:14:28.639 --> 00:14:31.130
Dad, stop talking.

269
00:14:34.478 --> 00:14:37.970
But Ji Young has been sleeping

270
00:14:37.982 --> 00:14:39.313
I think she is tired

271
00:14:39.817 --> 00:14:40.806
Is it

272
00:14:40.818 --> 00:14:41.978
Did you catch it?

273
00:14:54.999 --> 00:14:58.491
Unnie, our country is as such a small country

274
00:14:58.502 --> 00:15:01.335
Yeah, the world is so big

275
00:15:01.338 --> 00:15:03.329
Let's make a mark on the country we want to go to

276
00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:05.331
OK, Ji Young is going to get the stickers

277
00:15:05.342 --> 00:15:06.172
Ok

278
00:15:07.845 --> 00:15:09.335
Unnie, which color do you choose?

279
00:15:09.346 --> 00:15:10.506
I choose green

280
00:15:10.514 --> 00:15:13.176
Then I choose purple

281
00:15:13.183 --> 00:15:15.344
I choose the United States.

282
00:15:15.352 --> 00:15:16.512
How about Unnie?

283
00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:19.853
I choose Sweden.

284
00:15:19.857 --> 00:15:21.848
Denmark 

285
00:15:21.859 --> 00:15:23.349
Finland

286
00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:26.022
Why are you going to these strange places?

287
00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:28.021
Because there are no Koreans there

288
00:15:28.032 --> 00:15:29.522
What do you mean?

289
00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:31.701
You don't need to know

290
00:15:32.036 --> 00:15:33.367

291
00:15:33.871 --> 00:15:34.860
Don't

292
00:15:34.872 --> 00:15:37.864
Noisy

293
00:15:37.875 --> 00:15:41.538
Why are you so noisy when you first moved here?

294
00:15:41.545 --> 00:15:44.378
Girls must be quiet

295
00:15:44.381 --> 00:15:46.542
Got it? come out.

296
00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:49.383
Help mom eat food

297
00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:54.050
what

298
00:15:56.727 --> 00:15:59.890
Grandma... grandma

299
00:15:59.897 --> 00:16:04.732
Unnie grabbed my candy and make it dirty

300
00:16:08.072 --> 00:16:11.405
How is your wedding?

301
00:16:11.408 --> 00:16:13.069
Oh oh

302
00:16:13.744 --> 00:16:16.577
Nothing

303
00:16:17.915 --> 00:16:20.076
You haven't come, he's quite dead! 

304
00:16:21.418 --> 00:16:23.579
I won't die forever

305
00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:29.081
Now that you're married, let's do it. 

306
00:16:30.594 --> 00:16:32.095
Misuk

307
00:16:32.096 --> 00:16:35.259
For your brothers to go to school, you have to suffer

308
00:16:35.265 --> 00:16:36.425
Really?

309
00:16:38.435 --> 00:16:40.096
Stop talking, mom.

310
00:16:43.941 --> 00:16:46.102
Hurry and go back after lunch.

311
00:16:46.777 --> 00:16:48.438
Ji Young, Eun Young

312
00:16:48.445 --> 00:16:49.776
Put the tableware

313
00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:50.940
Yes

314
00:16:54.118 --> 00:16:55.449
Mother-in-law

315
00:16:55.452 --> 00:16:56.953
Are you happy to move?

316
00:16:56.954 --> 00:16:59.445
I also go out and played for several days.

317
00:16:59.456 --> 00:17:03.950
Oh, because of my second son.

318
00:17:03.961 --> 00:17:06.293
Yes, son-in-law is amazing

319
00:17:07.965 --> 00:17:09.125
Mom, eat.

320
00:17:09.133 --> 00:17:10.464
Come and eat

321
00:17:11.301 --> 00:17:16.967
Anyway, there must be at least four men in the house.

322
00:17:16.974 --> 00:17:20.466
I hope my daughter can have a son again.

323
00:17:20.477 --> 00:17:23.469
This is all for your own good.

324
00:17:24.648 --> 00:17:27.981
Gave birth to Jiseok.

325
00:17:27.985 --> 00:17:29.646
Space r card

326
00:17:29.653 --> 00:17:30.642
Grandma

327
00:17:30.654 --> 00:17:33.646
Second Uncle and third uncle are unwilling to see you.

328
00:17:33.657 --> 00:17:34.988
You still likes your son so much?

329
00:17:34.992 --> 00:17:37.984
Hey, what did you say?

330
00:17:37.995 --> 00:17:40.657
Who did she follow?

331
00:17:41.165 --> 00:17:43.497
I will honor my mother.

332
00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:45.331
Ouch, this kid

333
00:17:45.335 --> 00:17:47.997
The small mouth is so sweet

334
00:17:48.005 --> 00:17:51.168
When you grow up, try to get married

335
00:17:51.175 --> 00:17:52.836
I won't say that by the time

336
00:17:52.843 --> 00:17:55.334
No, it ’s not

337
00:17:56.180 --> 00:17:58.842
Ji Young, eat more

338
00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:12.521
Auntie

339
00:18:12.529 --> 00:18:13.359
Are you ready?

340
00:18:14.031 --> 00:18:16.363
The most useless worry in the world 

341
00:18:16.366 --> 00:18:17.867
I was worried about Kim Eun Young.

342
00:18:18.869 --> 00:18:20.359
Everyone is together

343
00:18:22.372 --> 00:18:24.033
Is it any holiday today?

344
00:18:24.875 --> 00:18:28.709
Oh, our Kim Ji Young hasn’t woke up yet.

345
00:18:28.712 --> 00:18:30.873
She looks tired

346
00:18:30.881 --> 00:18:32.872
Jiseok, this pen

347
00:18:32.883 --> 00:18:35.044
Where did you find it

348
00:18:35.052 --> 00:18:36.542
Under the table

349
00:18:36.553 --> 00:18:40.887
Isn't that pen? When Dad went to England on a business trip

350
00:18:40.891 --> 00:18:42.882
Did you just buy it for Jiseok?

351
00:18:42.893 --> 00:18:44.554
It's a notebook for both of us

352
00:18:44.561 --> 00:18:46.062
It's also a British notebook

353
00:18:46.063 --> 00:18:47.724
Right, dad?

354
00:18:47.731 --> 00:18:49.232
Start again. Start again.

355
00:18:49.233 --> 00:18:50.564
Really

356
00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:57.730
Brother-in-law

357
00:18:57.741 --> 00:18:59.732
Be careful with Kim Ji Young

358
00:18:59.743 --> 00:19:01.404
She is super persistent

359
00:19:01.411 --> 00:19:04.073
I asked for that for ten years.

360
00:19:04.081 --> 00:19:06.572
But you didn’t get it you due to stubbornness

361
00:19:11.755 --> 00:19:13.416
Oppa, this is a little weird

362
00:19:13.423 --> 00:19:15.755
Um what 

363
00:19:15.759 --> 00:19:20.093
About Mom, why didn’t you give Gui this time?

364
00:19:23.934 --> 00:19:26.926
I said it’s not necessary.

365
00:19:26.937 --> 00:19:30.270
Why don't I remember?

366
00:19:30.941 --> 00:19:32.602
Always forgetting things recently

367
00:19:34.111 --> 00:19:36.443
Don’t you have amnesia after giving birth?

368 
00:19:38.949 --> 00:19:41.941
Someone in our group had a child not long ago

369
00:19:41.952 --> 00:19:45.786
He said his wife had postpartum depression

370
00:19:45.789 --> 00:19:47.620
What kind of disease? Is it very serious?

371
00:19:47.624 --> 00:19:49.785
It seems that you can’t just wait and see.

372
00:19:49.793 --> 00:19:52.626
Yeah, I read the news too.

373
00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:57.130
How about you?

374
00:19:57.134 --> 00:19:57.623

375
00:19:57.634 --> 00:19:58.623
Me?

376
00:19:58.635 --> 00:20:01.968
This should be fine

377
00:20:04.641 --> 00:20:07.633
I always think about the past

378
00:20:07.644 --> 00:20:10.636
I feel empty when the sun goes down

379
00:20:10.647 --> 00:20:12.308
But this is not always the case

380
00:20:15.319 --> 00:20:17.651
Otherwise, you can go to psychiatry.

381
00:20:17.654 --> 00:20:19.986
Why do you think I'm neurotic?

382
00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:22.481
Hey, who said it was mentally ill recently?

383
00:20:22.492 --> 00:20:25.325
Many people in our company go to a psychiatric clinic regularly

384
00:20:25.329 --> 00:20:27.320
Chat with a doctor

385
00:20:27.331 --> 00:20:31.165
Maybe you can sort out the feeling of chronic depression

386
00:20:34.171 --> 00:20:35.502
Then, should I go there?

387
00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:39.502
Ask why the heart is empty when the sun goes down

388
00:20:39.509 --> 00:20:41.170
Alright

389
00:20:41.178 --> 00:20:43.339
Colleagues say there is a nice place

390
00:20:43.347 --> 00:20:44.507
You go there

391
00:20:44.514 --> 00:20:46.675
I'll give you contact information. Okay?

392
00:20:58.028 --> 00:20:59.359
I am out of breath

393
00:20:59.363 --> 00:21:01.024
What happened to you recently?

394
00:21:41.405 --> 00:21:44.397


395
00:21:46.743 --> 00:21:48.074
Mom

396
00:21:48.078 --> 00:21:49.409
Welcome

397
00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:51.741
I am not the first customer

398
00:21:51.748 --> 00:21:54.239
Who cares about this recently?

399
00:21:54.251 --> 00:21:55.240
And our shop

400
00:21:55.252 --> 00:21:56.920
I like women as first customer.

401
00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:58.251
Is it?

402
00:21:58.255 --> 00:21:59.745
Dad, I took these,

403
00:21:59.756 --> 00:22:00.256
It is good

404
00:22:00.257 --> 00:22:01.246
I'm going out

405
00:22:01.258 --> 00:22:02.748
Careful on the road

406
00:22:02.759 --> 00:22:04.260
I heard she found a job this time

407
00:22:04.261 --> 00:22:06.752
Yes, it's so worrying.

408
00:22:40.797 --> 00:22:42.628
The planning team released the list

409
00:22:42.632 --> 00:22:43.621
Have you seen it?

410
00:22:43.633 --> 00:22:44.622
Yes

411
00:22:48.138 --> 00:22:49.628
Good morning

412
00:22:51.308 --> 00:22:52.468
Congratulations

413
00:22:52.476 --> 00:22:54.137
You have been selected into the planning team

414
00:22:54.144 --> 00:22:55.475
Congratulations

415
00:22:57.314 --> 00:22:58.804
I really don't want to go.

416
00:22:58.815 --> 00:23:01.147
Hey, it's you, who is chosen by Team Leader Kim.

417
00:23:01.151 --> 00:23:02.482
You have to feel honored.

418
00:23:02.486 --> 00:23:04.317
He only chose men.

419
00:23:04.321 --> 00:23:06.812
Team Leader is particularly fierce

420
00:23:06.823 --> 00:23:08.984
It's ruthless.

421
00:23:08.992 --> 00:23:11.483
Reinstated less than a month after giving birth.

422
00:23:11.495 --> 00:23:12.655
Who will take care of that child?

423
00:23:12.662 --> 00:23:15.153
Captain Kim lives with her mother

424
00:23:15.165 --> 00:23:18.657
Wow, isn't her husband amazing?

425
00:23:18.668 --> 00:23:20.169


426
00:23:20.170 --> 00:23:21.330
The child is taken care of by the mother

427
00:23:21.338 --> 00:23:23.329
Why is her husband amazing?

428
00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:25.331
It’s harder to living with in-laws.

429
00:23:25.342 --> 00:23:26.172
Interlude son-in-law

430
00:23:26.176 --> 00:23:27.336
What did you say?

431
00:23:29.346 --> 00:23:31.507
What are you going to do?

432
00:23:31.515 --> 00:23:32.504
Yes

433
00:23:39.022 --> 00:23:39.852
Is it done?

434
00:23:39.856 --> 00:23:41.016
Director Yang is here

435
00:23:41.525 --> 00:23:42.685
So fast

436
00:23:42.692 --> 00:23:44.523
Chatting with Team Leader

437
00:23:44.528 --> 00:23:45.688
Unnie

438
00:23:54.204 --> 00:23:57.037
Let's take advantage of the atmosphere of the Beijing Olympics

439
00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:59.031
How about sports stars Park Tae-hyun?

440
00:24:01.211 --> 00:24:03.372
He must be expensive

441
00:24:06.716 --> 00:24:09.378
Our team leader’s child is not that old

442
00:24:09.386 --> 00:24:11.377
No, he will go to middle school this year

443
00:24:11.388 --> 00:24:12.719
Middle school

444
00:24:12.722 --> 00:24:15.054
This is worse. This is worse.

445
00:24:15.058 --> 00:24:17.891
It's going to be a storm

446
00:24:17.894 --> 00:24:20.055
These children brought up by the mother

447
00:24:20.063 --> 00:24:22.224
The period of rebellion is very serious

448
00:24:22.232 --> 00:24:25.724
Well, my mother takes good care of it

449
00:24:25.735 --> 00:24:28.067
Grandma and mother are different

450
00:24:28.071 --> 00:24:30.562
The child must stay with his mother

451
00:24:30.574 --> 00:24:33.737
Otherwise, he will go wrong

452
00:24:33.743 --> 00:24:37.577
If the career is successful, how can the child ruin everything?

453
00:24:37.581 --> 00:24:39.071
Really worrying

454
00:24:42.419 --> 00:24:45.081
This feels good as a promotional word

455
00:24:45.088 --> 00:24:46.248
Because mother didn't bring up

456
00:24:46.256 --> 00:24:48.747
And the children's vitamins

457
00:24:48.758 --> 00:24:51.591
"Sweeping breath training prepared by mother's mind"

458
00:24:51.595 --> 00:24:52.425
It's better to say so

459
00:24:52.429 --> 00:24:54.920
I will be stung by moms at work in the future

460
00:24:54.931 --> 00:24:57.092
Then you have to hit me once.

461
00:25:01.104 --> 00:25:05.598
Team leader, this is a bit overdone, right?

462
00:25:10.447 --> 00:25:14.440
Chief Kim, I can’t afford to joke

463
00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:18.781
It’s scary, don’t do this

464
00:25:19.623 --> 00:25:23.115
That's why Team Leader Kim can survive to this day.

465
00:25:23.126 --> 00:25:26.118
This is a pity

466
00:25:26.129 --> 00:25:28.461
I should be born as a man, right?
 

467
00:25:31.134 --> 00:25:32.294
director

468
00:25:34.971 --> 00:25:36.472
OK, how about a meeting?

469
00:25:36.473 --> 00:25:37.804
Alright

470
00:25:40.977 --> 00:25:43.639
The strategy for this event

471
00:25:43.647 --> 00:25:48.141
Is to expand influence on digital media

472
00:25:48.151 --> 00:25:51.484
Compare to 10% of digital media advertising today

473
00:25:51.488 --> 00:25:53.319
Expanded to about 30%

474
00:25:53.323 --> 00:25:56.486
Actively participate in promotional activities

475
00:25:58.662 --> 00:26:00.493
Team Leader is so cool

476
00:26:00.497 --> 00:26:01.657
She talked to Director Yang with a smile.

477
00:26:01.665 --> 00:26:03.997
Terrible 

478
00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:05.501
You are dead 

479
00:26:05.502 --> 00:26:06.992
I was worried about 

480
00:26:07.003 --> 00:26:08.334
I am afraid of Director Yang being angry

481
00:26:08.338 --> 00:26:10.829
Then you have to beat me once.

482
00:26:11.841 --> 00:26:14.002
OK, how about a meeting?

483
00:26:14.010 --> 00:26:14.999


484
00:26:21.851 --> 00:26:25.014
Come to my office

485
00:26:25.021 --> 00:26:26.181
Yes


486
00:26:36.866 --> 00:26:37.855

487
00:26:39.035 --> 00:26:40.536
These words are good for journalists.

488
00:26:40.537 --> 00:26:42.198
Humor is just right

489
00:26:42.205 --> 00:26:44.696
You don’t need to modify it at all.

490
00:26:44.708 --> 00:26:46.539
Keep it up

491
00:26:46.543 --> 00:26:47.532
Thank you 

492
00:26:47.544 --> 00:26:48.533
Go back to work

493
00:26:50.213 --> 00:26:53.376
Is there anything else to note?

494
00:26:53.383 --> 00:26:55.874
I don't. I just ask you to come to praise you

495
00:27:07.397 --> 00:27:08.887
What's wrong?

496
00:27:08.898 --> 00:27:11.731
I thought you hated me.

497
00:27:13.570 --> 00:27:16.403
Why? Is it because of the planning team?

498
00:27:16.406 --> 00:27:18.067
Yes 

499
00:27:18.074 --> 00:27:20.565
Why didn't you take me to the planning team?n

500
00:27:25.081 --> 00:27:27.413
It's not because you are not strong enough

501
00:27:27.417 --> 00:27:30.909
The company hopes to form a long-term team

502
00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:35.084
But the female employee is to be on maternity leave
So it ’s hard to last long

503
00:27:35.091 --> 00:27:36.592
Even if I insist on adding you

504
00:27:36.593 --> 00:27:38.083
I'm afraid there will be a lot of burden

505
00:27:38.094 --> 00:27:40.585
No, I can do well

506
00:27:41.931 --> 00:27:44.422
Ji Young, do I look good to you? 

507
00:27:45.101 --> 00:27:46.261
Yes.

508
00:27:47.437 --> 00:27:49.428
What's good?

509
00:27:49.439 --> 00:27:52.272
I am not a good mother.

510
00:27:52.275 --> 00:27:55.108
Not a good wife, not a good daughter.

511
00:27:55.111 --> 00:27:56.442
But you are still cool

512
00:27:56.446 --> 00:27:58.277
Even if I get married and have children,

513
00:27:58.281 --> 00:28:00.772
I am confident that I can work well, just like you

514
00:28:02.452 --> 00:28:04.443
Bye

515
00:28:04.454 --> 00:28:05.443
Bye

516
00:28:06.456 --> 00:28:08.117


517
00:28:08.124 --> 00:28:09.785
Go to our house
Really?

518
00:28:09.793 --> 00:28:11.954
Mother, Eunsuk and Ms. Shuxi are both upset

519
00:28:17.634 --> 00:28:18.794
Ah Young's mother

520
00:28:19.469 --> 00:28:21.960
We are going to have a cup of tea together

521
00:28:21.971 --> 00:28:23.302
Come with us too

522
00:28:23.306 --> 00:28:26.469
Ah, I still have something

523
00:28:26.476 --> 00:28:29.309
Ah do you work?

524
00:28:31.981 --> 00:28:33.482
Young Ho is pretty good

525
00:28:33.483 --> 00:28:34.313
What awesome

526
00:28:34.317 --> 00:28:35.147
Let him try as an idol

527
00:28:35.151 --> 00:28:36.982
What idol?

528
00:28:36.986 --> 00:28:38.817
What's Ah Young's mother doing?

529
00:28:38.822 --> 00:28:40.483
Come and sit

530
00:28:40.490 --> 00:28:42.151
Do you have older children?
 

531
00:28:44.828 --> 00:28:46.989
That's the problem I solved 

532
00:28:48.164 --> 00:28:50.155
Come over and sit down
Come over

533
00:28:51.167 --> 00:28:52.498
How many hours do I have to solve? 

534
00:28:52.502 --> 00:28:56.666
The strange thing is that when solving math problems

535
00:28:56.673 --> 00:28:58.504
There will be dim sum

536
00:28:58.508 --> 00:29:00.169
Oh my god

537
00:29:00.176 --> 00:29:02.838
Young Ho's mother is a science student at Seoul National University.

538
00:29:04.848 --> 00:29:07.009
I don’t know why I studied so hard

539
00:29:07.016 --> 00:29:08.677
In order to teach Young Ho the multiplication

540
00:29:10.019 --> 00:29:11.520
One is so

541
00:29:11.521 --> 00:29:13.182
I just came over   

542
00:29:13.857 --> 00:29:16.519
But what is Ah Young's mother's major?

543
00:29:16.526 --> 00:29:18.357
Mine is Mandarin

544
00:29:19.362 --> 00:29:20.693
The novelist? 

545
00:29:20.697 --> 00:29:23.689
No, it’s just a dream at school

546
00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:26.533
After graduation, to work at a publicity company.

547
00:29:26.536 --> 00:29:28.197
That's it. 

548
00:29:28.204 --> 00:29:29.865
What is your profession?

549
00:29:29.873 --> 00:29:32.205
I'm studying for my family

550
00:29:32.208 --> 00:29:34.540
I took the performance department

551
00:29:34.544 --> 00:29:36.034
Yes

552
00:29:36.045 --> 00:29:37.546
Mirror, mirror

553
00:29:37.547 --> 00:29:40.209
Who is the most beautiful person in the world?

554
00:29:40.216 --> 00:29:42.207
Snow White

555
00:29:42.218 --> 00:29:44.049
I want to kill her

556
00:29:44.053 --> 00:29:46.044
Is your child okay?

557
00:29:46.055 --> 00:29:46.214

558
00:29:46.222 --> 00:29:46.381

559
00:29:46.389 --> 00:29:46.548

560
00:29:46.556 --> 00:29:46.715

561
00:29:46.723 --> 00:29:46.882
I am so angry that I will cry

562
00:29:48.057 --> 00:29:50.218
This act has some tricks

563
00:30:09.579 --> 00:30:10.739
After sending the child to school

564
00:30:10.747 --> 00:30:13.409
It’s just in the morning.

565
00:30:13.416 --> 00:30:16.249
If it weren't for a move, I would love to continue.

566
00:30:16.252 --> 00:30:18.743
It’s not too difficult to just look after the cash register.

567
00:30:19.756 --> 00:30:20.745
it is good

568
00:30:29.265 --> 00:30:30.596
Hello, Unnie

569
00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:32.601
Oh come on

570
00:30:32.602 --> 00:30:34.934
Good good

571
00:30:34.938 --> 00:30:36.929
Oh, Ah Young is so good

572
00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:38.931
She can speak now

573
00:30:38.942 --> 00:30:41.433
Is it so fast?

574
00:30:41.444 --> 00:30:43.105
Not a genius

575
00:30:43.112 --> 00:30:46.275
But like my Oppa, he is very talented in language.

576
00:30:46.282 --> 00:30:49.274
Um, it's Dae Hyun.

577
00:30:52.956 --> 00:30:56.119
Oh, Ah Young is so good

578
00:30:59.295 --> 00:31:00.956
You're almost there

579
00:31:00.964 --> 00:31:03.626
But Dae Hyun is too energetic, right?

580
00:31:03.633 --> 00:31:05.965
Why are you blaming my Oppa?

581
00:31:05.969 --> 00:31:07.459
He often helps me

582
00:31:07.470 --> 00:31:09.461
What does it mean to help you?

583
00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:12.130
right

584
00:31:13.309 --> 00:31:15.800
By the way, there is news

585
00:31:15.812 --> 00:31:18.144
Team leader Kim is resigning

586
00:31:18.147 --> 00:31:18.977
why

587
00:31:18.982 --> 00:31:20.813
Maybe she can't stand it

588
00:31:20.817 --> 00:31:23.980
Hey, what about it?
The problem is that you can't be promoted.

589
00:31:23.987 --> 00:31:26.478
I heard she want to start a company.

590
00:31:26.489 --> 00:31:28.480
Focus on the promotion team

591
00:31:28.491 --> 00:31:29.992
Feeling like Mi Jung is also going to go

592
00:31:29.993 --> 00:31:31.153
What about you?

593
00:31:31.828 --> 00:31:33.659
I was promoted this time

594
00:31:34.163 --> 00:31:35.664
So I want to see it again

595
00:31:35.665 --> 00:31:37.155
Congratulations congratulations

596
00:31:37.166 --> 00:31:38.155
congratulations

597
00:31:38.167 --> 00:31:40.658
What are you talking about?

598
00:31:40.670 --> 00:31:43.503
Male colleagues joined in the same period last year
Can all titles be changed?

599
00:31:43.506 --> 00:31:44.165
Jealous

600
00:31:44.173 --> 00:31:45.834
Just think about it, I'll be jealous again

601
00:31:47.343 --> 00:31:48.844
Anyway, I envy you

602
00:31:54.851 --> 00:31:57.843
You call Team Leader and try

603
00:31:57.854 --> 00:31:58.684
me?

604
00:31:58.688 --> 00:32:01.521
Yeah. You go back to work

605
00:32:01.524 --> 00:32:03.355
I can't

606
00:32:03.359 --> 00:32:05.520
Occasionally part-time

607
00:32:05.528 --> 00:32:07.689
I'm afraid it's hard to go to work.

608
00:32:08.531 --> 00:32:11.523
Okay then, don't go to work

609
00:32:11.534 --> 00:32:12.865
Hello, bring up Ah Young well

610
00:32:12.869 --> 00:32:14.860
That is also a great thing

611
00:32:15.538 --> 00:32:19.702
Ji Young, there you are. 

612
00:32:19.709 --> 00:32:21.700
I am a spinster

613
00:32:21.711 --> 00:32:23.872
Work hard all my life until I die

614
00:32:27.050 --> 00:32:29.211
Don't you think it's funny, I'm a spinster

615
00:32:29.218 --> 00:32:30.378
Funny

616
00:32:30.386 --> 00:32:32.718
Do you have to laugh?

617
00:32:32.722 --> 00:32:34.883
It is funny, Unnie

618
00:33:06.255 --> 00:33:07.756
Bye

619
00:33:09.258 --> 00:33:10.759
Ah, you are Ah Young's ....

620
00:33:12.929 --> 00:33:14.260
Are you ok?

621
00:33:15.098 --> 00:33:16.759
I thought I was running late

622
00:33:17.433 --> 00:33:18.593
Note again

623
00:33:19.435 --> 00:33:20.936
Ah Young

624
00:34:03.646 --> 00:34:04.635
What?

625
00:34:07.316 --> 00:34:08.305
Ok

626
00:34:11.154 --> 00:34:13.645
This rice is really getting worse

627
00:34:14.323 --> 00:34:16.655
Is it really hot?
What

628
00:34:16.659 --> 00:34:20.151
Look at this again

629
00:34:20.163 --> 00:34:21.994
What are you looking at

630
00:34:23.833 --> 00:34:25.164
It's nothing

631
00:34:27.170 --> 00:34:28.660
okay

632
00:34:35.845 --> 00:34:37.005
What are they looking at?

633
00:34:37.013 --> 00:34:38.503
Don't you know? 

634
00:34:38.514 --> 00:34:39.674
After nothing more than setting up a chat group

635
00:34:39.682 --> 00:34:41.183
Upload Erotic Photo

636
00:34:41.184 --> 00:34:42.344
Should be considered a beast

637
00:34:43.853 --> 00:34:45.343
Unreasonable

638
00:34:45.354 --> 00:34:46.343
so envious

639
00:34:46.856 --> 00:34:47.686
what?

640
00:34:48.357 --> 00:34:52.350
No, they have at least time to be ridiculous

641
00:34:52.361 --> 00:34:54.522
So feel envious

642
00:34:54.530 --> 00:34:56.361
Ouch, as long as I go home

643
00:34:56.365 --> 00:34:57.525
Children scramble for me to play with them

644
00:34:57.533 --> 00:34:59.034
Where is the final photo? I still have to see his wife's face

645
00:34:59.035 --> 00:35:01.026
That is, ten is dizzy, dizzy

646
00:35:02.205 --> 00:35:04.537
Suddenly depressed again

647
00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:07.532
I always feel like going to the hospital

648
00:35:09.545 --> 00:35:12.207
It would be better if I went to the hospital?

649
00:35:12.215 --> 00:35:13.876
I mean like depression

650
00:35:13.883 --> 00:35:15.214
You suffer too

651
00:35:16.052 --> 00:35:17.383
Let's go together 

652
00:35:17.386 --> 00:35:20.048
Hello, let's go and see together. 

653
00:35:20.056 --> 00:35:21.216
You've given a lot of evidence recently

654
00:35:21.224 --> 00:35:25.217
No, it's not me

655
00:35:25.228 --> 00:35:27.560
But my friend's wife thinks

656
00:35:27.563 --> 00:35:30.396
Occasionally makes him feel like they are

657
00:35:30.399 --> 00:35:33.391
What is it? Is it a ghost? Is it psycho?

658
00:35:33.402 --> 00:35:35.233
Not that kind of thinking

659
00:35:35.238 --> 00:35:36.569
That's crazy

660
00:35:37.406 --> 00:35:38.236
No no

661
00:35:38.241 --> 00:35:40.402
Does his wife know his status?

662
00:35:41.077 --> 00:35:44.410
I don’t know. My friend didn’t tell her.
Why?

663
00:35:47.583 --> 00:35:48.914
May be afraid.   

664
00:35:49.752 --> 00:35:50.912
Must be afraid

665
00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:52.410
If that person knows his situation,

666
00:35:52.421 --> 00:35:53.251
Will it get worse?

667
00:35:53.256 --> 00:35:54.746
Just right just right hey

668
00:35:54.757 --> 00:35:57.089
It’s a laughing stock to live with that kind of person

669
00:35:57.093 --> 00:35:59.254
Wait and see, that woman will be psycho soon

670
00:35:59.262 --> 00:36:01.753
Soon I will be carrying a sword or something

671
00:36:01.764 --> 00:36:03.265
Sooner or later, he will be stabbed.

672
00:36:03.266 --> 00:36:04.597
Weird

673
00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:07.091
Like a crazy woman

674
00:36:07.103 --> 00:36:09.594
Should be isolated from society.

675
00:36:09.605 --> 00:36:10.435


676
00:36:12.275 --> 00:36:14.106
Sorry, I thought it was empty

677
00:36:15.278 --> 00:36:17.109
Damn, what happened to him?

678
00:36:55.818 --> 00:36:58.480


679
00:37:00.990 --> 00:37:03.982
I said, do you want to go to the gym?

680
00:37:05.494 --> 00:37:07.485
How can there be time for that?

681
00:37:07.496 --> 00:37:08.827
It's for fitness

682
00:37:08.831 --> 00:37:11.322
Will make you feel better and help your health

683
00:37:14.837 --> 00:37:15.826
Oppa
 

684
00:37:17.006 --> 00:37:18.837
Then, I'll go to the bakery for a part-time job.
  

685
00:37:18.841 --> 00:37:20.172
Just across the road
  

686
00:37:22.011 --> 00:37:24.172
Do you want to do?
What?
  

687
00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:27.343
Ji Young, what's your situation now?
  

688
00:37:28.517 --> 00:37:31.850
No, you're tired of taking care of Ah Young
  

689
00:37:31.854 --> 00:37:33.185
Only in the morning
  

690
00:37:33.189 --> 00:37:34.019
Don't do it
  

691
00:37:34.023 --> 00:37:35.354
Should not be too tired

692
00:37:35.358 --> 00:37:37.189
No one wants you to do that part-time job

693
00:37:53.209 --> 00:37:54.039

694
00:37:57.213 --> 00:37:58.373
Ji Young,

695
00:37:58.881 --> 00:38:01.213
I stop you from doing what you want

696
00:38:01.217 --> 00:38:03.208
Let alone watch what you don’t want to do

697
00:38:03.219 --> 00:38:05.050
Your body is tired too

698
00:38:06.055 --> 00:38:06.885
I just thought

699
00:38:06.889 --> 00:38:10.222
Oppa, thank you.

700
00:38:10.226 --> 00:38:12.387
Thank you for caring about my body.

701
00:38:37.753 --> 00:38:38.913
Are you drinking?
  

702
00:38:54.603 --> 00:38:55.763
Are you angry?
 

703
00:38:58.107 --> 00:38:59.768
Don't you know how to drink?
  

704
00:39:07.283 --> 00:39:11.276
It seems you are angry
  

705
00:39:11.287 --> 00:39:12.618
Hello, Jung Dae Hyun
  

706
00:39:16.459 --> 00:39:19.792
Ji Young is suffering recently
  

707
00:39:19.795 --> 00:39:21.786
Although weaned, her body was a little relaxed
  

708
00:39:21.797 --> 00:39:23.788
But she was so anxious
  

709
00:39:24.467 --> 00:39:26.958
Talk to her more
  

710
00:39:26.969 --> 00:39:28.960
Well done, thank you
  

711
00:39:30.973 --> 00:39:31.473
Ji Young

712
00:39:31.474 --> 00:39:33.135
Hey, I know you like Ji Young 

713
00:39:33.142 --> 00:39:35.474
Stop calling, be careful.

714
00:39:36.145 --> 00:39:37.806
do not do that

715
00:39:37.813 --> 00:39:38.643
In your eyes

716
00:39:39.315 --> 00:39:43.979
I'm still the one who was so nervous and shivering in the midsummer
Are you still 20-year-old that Che Seung-yeon confessed?

717
00:39:45.154 --> 00:39:45.813

718
00:39:45.821 --> 00:39:45.980

719
00:39:45.988 --> 00:39:46.147

720
00:39:46.155 --> 00:39:46.314

721
00:39:46.322 --> 00:39:46.481

722
00:39:55.831 --> 00:39:59.164
Cha Seung Yeon is my college classmate.

723
00:40:00.503 --> 00:40:02.994
She is also the school senior of the mountaineering community that Ji Young joined.

724
00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:06.831
Ji Young likes Seung Yeon a lot.

725
00:40:07.843 --> 00:40:11.176
But something happened last year when she gave birth.

726
00:40:11.180 --> 00:40:13.341
It makes Ji Young sad for a long time.

727
00:40:14.517 --> 00:40:16.678
She has been depressed for a while.

728
00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:19.181
Is that the cause?

729
00:40:20.022 --> 00:40:22.855
Anyway, I want to see her in person.

730
00:40:43.712 --> 00:40:45.213
Oppa, really?

731
00:40:45.214 --> 00:40:47.705
A few days ago did I really drink? 

732
00:40:48.217 --> 00:40:49.206
Yes.

733
00:40:49.218 --> 00:40:51.209
Really?

734
00:40:51.220 --> 00:40:53.711
I wake up in the morning with cans on the nightstand

735
00:40:53.722 --> 00:40:56.054
I still have alcohol in my mouth

736
00:40:56.058 --> 00:40:57.719
But why am I not impressed?

737
00:40:57.726 --> 00:40:59.227
So be sure to check it out today

738
00:40:59.228 --> 00:41:00.217
Ok?

739
00:41:01.730 --> 00:41:03.231
Got it, let me go

740
00:41:03.232 --> 00:41:03.891
Definitely

741
00:41:03.899 --> 00:41:05.890
Okay, be careful, be late.

742
00:41:08.404 --> 00:41:10.235
Surely
I know

743
00:41:49.278 --> 00:41:50.939
  

744
00:41:50.946 --> 00:41:52.106
Mom are you in the shop?

745
00:41:52.114 --> 00:41:54.105
At this time, of course, in the shop

746
00:41:54.116 --> 00:41:56.277
Where is Ah Young?

747
00:41:56.285 --> 00:41:59.448
Yeah but
  

748
00:41:59.455 --> 00:42:01.286
Do you need a receipt?

749
00:42:01.290 --> 00:42:02.951
Ji Young, wait a minute

750
00:42:02.958 --> 00:42:04.619
Thank you for your patronage

751
00:42:05.794 --> 00:42:06.783
Ji Young

752
00:42:06.795 --> 00:42:09.628
Mother is busy now

753
00:42:09.632 --> 00:42:10.291
Ok

754
00:42:10.299 --> 00:42:12.961
By the way, come this weekend

755
00:42:12.968 --> 00:42:14.799
Of course

756
00:42:14.803 --> 00:42:16.794
But, Oppa have to attend a company seminar

757
00:42:16.805 --> 00:42:18.306
Ah I heard

758
00:42:18.307 --> 00:42:20.138
Welcome

759
00:42:20.142 --> 00:42:21.643
If it's okay, I'll hang up.

760
00:42:42.831 --> 00:42:44.992
Do you have to do this?

761
00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:45.989
Yes

762
00:42:49.171 --> 00:42:53.005
How much is the inspection fee?

763
00:42:53.509 --> 00:42:56.000
There are three checks to be done

764
00:42:56.011 --> 00:42:59.344
The cost is about 350,000

765
00:43:04.186 --> 00:43:05.847
So I came out

766
00:43:07.022 --> 00:43:09.013
Don't you know?

767
00:43:09.024 --> 00:43:10.184
what did you say?

768
00:43:12.528 --> 00:43:15.361
No, aren't you all registered?

769
00:43:15.364 --> 00:43:17.025
Do you know what the inspection fee is

770
00:43:17.032 --> 00:43:19.193 
I can't bear it, I'm not serious

771
00:43:19.201 --> 00:43:20.361
Ji Young, you

772
00:43:26.875 --> 00:43:27.864
Oppa

773
00:43:28.544 --> 00:43:30.375
Do I talk in my sleep?

774
00:43:30.379 --> 00:43:33.371
I don't understand. Why would you want me to go to the hospital?

775
00:43:33.382 --> 00:43:34.542
It's not

776
00:43:35.217 --> 00:43:39.711
Because you say forgetfulness and uneasiness

777
00:43:39.722 --> 00:43:40.882
No

778
00:43:40.889 --> 00:43:43.380
Usually forgetful after giving birth

779
00:43:43.392 --> 00:43:45.223
It's not that I'm upset.

780
00:43:45.227 --> 00:43:46.888
Blame me for talking

781
00:43:46.895 --> 00:43:48.726
Rest assured. I'm fine

782
00:44: 26.935 --> 00:44:28.095
Hello, Ji Young.

783
00:44:28.103 --> 00:44:30.435
Hey, I want to ask you something.

784
00:44:30.439 --> 00:44:31.770
Um what's up?

785
00:44:31.774 --> 00:44:34.265
Didn't Team leader Kim's phone change?

786
00:44:34.276 --> 00:44:35.265
of course

787
00:44:37.112 --> 00:44:38.773
The team leader is going back to the office

788
00:44:38.781 --> 00:44:40.442
Would you like her to answer the phone?
Not very convenient now

789
00:44:40.449 --> 00:44:42.440
No, no,  Unnie, I will hang up

790
00:44:43.118 --> 00:44:45.780
Yeah, come back later
Okay, ok, wait for me

791
00:44:45.788 --> 00:44:47.278
I will go out.

792
00:44:56.131 --> 00:44:58.463
Don't go to the toilet on the third floor

793
00:44:58.467 --> 00:44:58.626
Why? Why?

794
00:44:58.634 --> 00:44:58.793

795
00:44:58.801 --> 00:45:00.792

796
00:45:00.803 --> 00:45:02.634
Just listen to me

797
00:45:02.638 --> 00:45:05.129
You must tell me why.

798
00:45:05.140 --> 00:45:07.131
If not, I still have to go

799
00:45:07.643 --> 00:45:10.806
No, I'm going crazy

800
00:45:17.486 --> 00:45:18.646
Wait a minute

801
00:45:24.326 --> 00:45:25.657
Do you have a tablet?

802
00:45:29.665 --> 00:45:32.657
The third floor is broken. Go to another floor.

803
00:45:32.668 --> 00:45:36.502
No, I went to just now

804
00:45:36.505 --> 00:45:37.995
Unnie

805
00:45:38.006 --> 00:45:41.669
What's wrong with your face? Is it uncomfortable?

806
00:46:10.539 --> 00:46:11.528
Come here

807
00:46:19.214 --> 00:46:21.375
Did you say that the hidden camera is installed?

808
00:46:21.383 --> 00:46:22.213
Yeah

809
00:46:22.217 --> 00:46:23.377
What about that security guard?

810
00:46:23.385 --> 00:46:26.047
That bastard is the installer

811
00:46:26.054 --> 00:46:28.716
But the person I'm angry with is Mr. Wu.

812
00:46:28.724 --> 00:46:31.386
No. Since I found that photo on the Internet

813
00:46:31.393 --> 00:46:33.384
If you know it's our company, you should call the police.

814
00:46:33.395 --> 00:46:37.388
How can I sit it with my male colleagues?

815
00:46:38.567 --> 00:46:40.057
Too ridiculous

816
00:46:40.068 --> 00:46:42.229
I always go to the bathroom on the third floor

817
00:46:43.572 --> 00:46:47.235
I thought of going to the police station tomorrow to verify my photo

818
00:46:47.242 --> 00:46:49.233
My heart is terrible

819
00:46:49.244 --> 00:46:52.407
Honestly, everyone is comforting me

820
00:46:52.414 --> 00:46:54.905
But when I think of that bastard, I see my ass.

821
00:46:54.917 --> 00:46:56.748
I'm so mad at him

822
00:46:56.752 --> 00:46:58.583
This is terrible. 

823
00:46:58.587 --> 00:47:01.420
Hey, when we go to the bathroom,

824
00:47:01.423 --> 00:47:02.754
Must check it out

825
00:47:02.758 --> 00:47:05.090
Check for small holes

826
00:47:05.761 --> 00:47:07.752
Hey, who cares about those photos when you are in a hurry?

827
00:47:09.264 --> 00:47:09.923
Urinal

828
00:47:09.932 --> 00:47:12.093
Hey, how can you hold a urinal?

829
00:47:12.935 --> 00:47:13.765
Ji Young
 
830
00:47:13.769 --> 00:47:15.760
Are you using Ah Young with wet urine?

831
00:48:14.997 --> 00:48:17.830
Are you uncomfortable?

832
00:48:17.833 --> 00:48:18.993
Do you want to sit?

833
00:48:20.335 --> 00:48:21.495
No need.  

834
00:48:51.033 --> 00:48:52.022
Hey
Don't go

835
00:48:57.873 --> 00:49:00.706
Did you hear me calling you?

836
00:49:03.545 --> 00:49:06.378
Classmate

837
00:49:07.549 --> 00:49:10.040
As soon as you got off the car

838
00:49:14.389 --> 00:49:18.382
I am frightened

839
00:49:18.393 --> 00:49:20.054
it's okay, no problem

840
00:49:24.566 --> 00:49:27.057
Ji Young, Ji Young

841
00:49:27.069 --> 00:49:28.058
Dad

842
00:49:28.070 --> 00:49:29.731
What's up?

843
00:49:29.738 --> 00:49:31.228
It's okay now

844
00:49:36.078 --> 00:49:40.913
Why are you going to such a cram school?

845
00:49:41.583 --> 00:49:42.914
Replace it immediately

846
00:49:47.255 --> 00:49:49.416
You must be dressed appropriately

847
00:49:49.424 --> 00:49:51.415
It is hot and see how short the skirt is

848
00:49:52.094 --> 00:49:54.927
And don't smile at people

849
00:49:54.930 --> 00:49:57.763
I didn't smile, I don't even remember the guy's face

850
00:49:58.433 --> 00:49:59.764
That is the problem

851
00:49:59.768 --> 00:50:01.099
Why can't you remember?

852
00:50:01.103 --> 00:50:02.593
You should always pay attention

853
00:50:02.604 --> 00:50:04.595
Don't take it lightly and avoid that kind of person

854
00:50:04.606 --> 00:50:05.937
The guy came by himself

855
00:50:05.941 --> 00:50:07.431
Can he bear it?

856
00:50:07.442 --> 00:50:09.603
If you can't avoid. It is your own fault

857
00:50:10.779 --> 00:50:11.939
Got it?

858
00:50:22.124 --> 00:50:23.614
Are you ok?

859
00:50:25.460 --> 00:50:27.792
Ah yeah

860
00:50:52.154 --> 00:50:53.314
Ji Young

861
00:51:05.500 --> 00:51:07.001
Are you Ji Young?

862
00:51:10.839 --> 00:51:12.170
what are you talking about

863
00:51:19.181 --> 00:51:22.344
What's wrong with you?

864
00:51:29.024 --> 00:51:30.013
Mom

865
00:51:38.366 --> 00:51:40.698
I can't understand

866
00:51:40.702 --> 00:51:42.863
Why did you leave like that?

867
00:51:50.712 --> 00:51:52.873
God

868
00:51:54.382 --> 00:51:56.213
Really weird

869
00:51:58.720 --> 00:52:00.051
Sorry

870
00:52:00.722 --> 00:52:02.713
Also you said sorry. 

871
00:52:03.225 --> 00:52:04.715
What are you sorry about?

872
00:52:11.233 --> 00:52:13.064
I have to go back to the company

873
00:52:14.903 --> 00:52:17.394
Then I have to go back too

874
00:52:17.405 --> 00:52:21.239
You go back to my house, as long as you don't tell Ji Young

875
00:52:21.243 --> 00:52:23.734
I looked at her who was ill

876
00:52:25.080 --> 00:52:27.412
I'm thin-skinned

877
00:52:29.251 --> 00:52:30.741
Are you ok?

878
00:52:31.419 --> 00:52:32.579
Certainly

879
00:52:33.588 --> 00:52:36.921
Hey it's strange

880
00:52:36.925 --> 00:52:38.586
Why is she?

881
00:52:40.929 --> 00:52:42.590
Hey

882
00:52:55.777 --> 00:52:56.766
Hi, mother-in-law

883
00:52:56.778 --> 00:52:59.269
It's me. I'm in Seoul

884
00:52:59.281 --> 00:53:00.441
Are you in Seoul?

885
00:53:00.448 --> 00:53:02.109
I came over once

886
00:53:02.117 --> 00:53:03.948
I'm going back now

887
00:53:04.452 --> 00:53:05.441
Why don't you come and sit at home?

888
00:53:05.453 --> 00:53:07.444
Just go back

889
00:53:07.455 --> 00:53:09.787
I have something tomorrow, I have to go back

890
00:53:09.791 --> 00:53:12.123
The thing is..

891
00:53:12.127 --> 00:53:14.459
I know a Chinese medicine hospital is famous

892
00:53:14.462 --> 00:53:15.793
I'll prescribe some tonic and send it to you

893
00:53:15.797 --> 00:53:17.458
You have to eat on time

894
00:53:17.465 --> 00:53:19.956
I should prescribe it for you

895
00:53:20.635 --> 00:53:22.296
Eat well

896
00:53:22.304 --> 00:53:23.794
Looking at children and not eating on time

897
00:53:23.805 --> 00:53:25.636
It will hurt me

898
00:53:25.640 --> 00:53:26.629
Ok

899
00:53:26.641 --> 00:53:28.802
I hang up. Bye

900
00:53:28.810 --> 00:53:29.970
Ok

901
00:53:38.653 --> 00:53:41.144
Where is that blue muffler?

902
00:53:41.156 --> 00:53:42.646
It is hanged

903
00:53:43.491 --> 00:53:44.992
No upper left corner

904
00:53:52.834 --> 00:53:54.825
Why is the seminar today?

905
00:53:55.837 --> 00:53:56.997
Otherwise, I won't go

906
00:53:57.005 --> 00:53:58.165
Nevermind

907
00:54:04.512 --> 00:54:06.503
You should take a taxi. Promise me

908
00:54:07.349 --> 00:54:09.510
If you feel tired, just call me

909
00:54:09.517 --> 00:54:11.508
I'll call you, can you run over right away?

910
00:54:13.021 --> 00:54:15.512
Okay, hurry and be late

911
00:54:18.860 --> 00:54:19.849
I'm leaving

912
00:54:21.029 --> 00:54:23.691
Ah Young, dad is gone.

913
00:54:23.698 --> 00:54:24.687
kiss

914
00:54:51.726 --> 00:54:54.058
Your princess is wet.

915
00:54:59.734 --> 00:54:59.893
Sorry

916
00:54:59.901 --> 00:55:01.232


917
00:55:06.074 --> 00:55:07.564
Alright, alright

918
00:55:08.743 --> 00:55:10.074
Ah Young

919
00:55:19.421 --> 00:55:22.413
Wait a minute

920
00:56:01.463 --> 00:56:03.294
Mom goes to the toilet too

921
00:56:40.502 --> 00:56:43.835
The teacher's handwriting looks good

922
00:56:43.838 --> 00:56:46.500
I used to want to be a teacher
  

923
00:56:49.844 --> 00:56:52.677
Really

924
00:56:52.680 --> 00:56:55.342
When mom was in elementary school
Among the five siblings

925
00:56:55.350 --> 00:56:57.341
Mom's learning is the best

926
00:56:57.352 --> 00:56:59.684
Better than my sister-in-law

927
00:57:03.024 --> 00:57:06.357
But why didn't you go to be a teacher?

928
00:57:08.363 --> 00:57:12.197
To make money for my brothers to go to college

929
00:57:12.200 --> 00:57:14.361
What do you make?

930
00:57:16.871 --> 00:57:18.862
Mom is..

931
00:57:18.873 --> 00:57:21.364
Making clothes in Cheonggyecheon

932
00:57:26.548 --> 00:57:30.712
It's okay. The girls at that time were so white and vivid.

933
00:57:30.718 --> 00:57:32.549
All come here

934
00:57:33.721 --> 00:57:37.213
Then you can be a teacher now.

935
00:57:37.225 --> 00:57:40.888
Now, she's Ji Young's mother

936
00:57:40.895 --> 00:57:43.557
I have to take care of you

937
00:57:43.565 --> 00:57:45.897
Is it because of me, you can’t do it?

938
00:57:56.411 --> 00:57:57.571
mom

939
00:57:58.246 --> 00:57:59.736
You've slept

940
00:58:02.917 --> 00:58:04.578
Is the seaweed soup ready?

941
00:58:04.586 --> 00:58:05.746
Should I do it?

942
00:58:05.753 --> 00:58:07.084
No more. No more.

943
00:58:07.755 --> 00:58:10.588
Where are you, Ah Young?

944
00:58:11.426 --> 00:58:16.261
Eun Young scared me and made me do nothing

945
00:58:16.264 --> 00:58:18.596
What will she do?

946
00:58:18.600 --> 00:58:20.932
I should buy it if Kim Eunyoung

947
00:58:21.603 --> 00:58:24.595
I don't know. Jiseok called.

948
00:58:24.606 --> 00:58:26.096
Where's dad?

949
00:58:26.107 --> 00:58:29.270
Dad went to pick up the aunts,   

950
00:58:31.613 --> 00:58:34.104
You should be very tired to bring your child here.

951
00:58:34.616 --> 00:58:36.447
She pooped on the road 

952
00:58:37.285 --> 00:58:41.949
Whoops, Ah Young still poops

953
00:58:46.461 --> 00:58:51.296
You are just like my daughter

954
00:58:51.299 --> 00:58:52.459
Or to say

955
00:58:52.467 --> 00:58:57.461
You’re like my Oppa. You just touched your abs.

956
00:58:57.472 --> 00:58:59.463
What a fuss is drunk

957
00:59:01.643 --> 00:59:05.636
Yes
If she is someone's daughter or someone's sister

958
00:59:05.647 --> 00:59:08.639
These are all considered sexual harassment

959
00:59:08.650 --> 00:59:09.981
Do you understand?

960
00:59:09.984 --> 00:59:13.476
Maybe you will wear handcuffs.

961
00:59:20.995 --> 00:59:24.328
Why on earth do you have to attend this class?

962
00:59:24.332 --> 00:59:26.323
Where is the purpose?

963
00:59:26.334 --> 00:59:28.996
All because you want someone like you to provoke

964
00:59:29.003 --> 00:59:31.836
When you treat female employees, be safe

965
00:59:31.839 --> 00:59:33.500
The times have changed

966
00:59:33.508 --> 00:59:34.668
Abominable

967
00:59:36.678 --> 00:59:38.669
I should be born in the Joseon era

968
00:59:40.348 --> 00:59:43.340
Come here. Please leave me

969
00:59:45.353 --> 00:59:47.844
Why are there so many things to be careful about lately?

970
00:59:47.855 --> 00:59:50.688
It’s hot

971
00:59:51.693 --> 00:59:54.526
I think of my wife, my heart is very dull

972
00:59:56.864 --> 01:00:00.857
It’s better than my wife’s wishes.

973
01:00:00.868 --> 01:00:02.199
Parental leave

974
01:00:02.203 --> 01:00:06.037
Yes, my wife asked me to ask for parental leave.

975
01:00:06.040 --> 01:00:09.373
Otherwise, she gave all the money she made to the babysitter

976
01:00:09.377 --> 01:00:10.867
Go to work by herself

977
01:00:12.046 --> 01:00:13.877
So be it

978
01:00:13.881 --> 01:00:16.543
You go on like this
It's the same as Agent Park's end.

979
01:00:16.551 --> 01:00:19.543
When you come back, your desk is goodbye

980
01:00:19.554 --> 01:00:21.385
Did he retire? 

981
01:00:21.389 --> 01:00:22.879
How could that be said

982
01:00:22.890 --> 01:00:24.721
See the seniors taking parental leave

983
01:00:24.726 --> 01:00:27.559
They look all over their faces

984
01:00:27.562 --> 01:00:29.052
The atmosphere is like this

985
01:00:29.063 --> 01:00:30.394
Just feeling

986
01:00:31.566 --> 01:00:35.900
What on earth do you want me to do?

987
01:00:42.410 --> 01:00:44.571
This color is so pretty

988
01:00:47.582 --> 01:00:49.243
Thank you  Unnie

989
01:00:49.250 --> 01:00:49.909
how about it

990
01:00:49.917 --> 01:00:51.248
Nice mom

991
01:00:51.252 --> 01:00:55.245
Unnie, we are going to wear this elegant thing recently

992
01:00:55.256 --> 01:00:56.587
Of course

993
01:00:56.591 --> 01:00:59.754
That dress should be more gorgeous

994
01:00:59.761 --> 01:01:01.422
What's wrong? I'm fine.

995
01:01:01.429 --> 01:01:02.589
What good

996
01:01:02.597 --> 01:01:04.258
Ji Young

997
01:01:04.265 --> 01:01:08.599
No matter how difficult it is to raise a child, you must dress yourself up

998
01:01:08.603 --> 01:01:10.935
Women should be beautiful

999
01:01:10.938 --> 01:01:12.599
I'm pretty without clothes

1000
01:01:12.607 --> 01:01:15.269
What are you looking at?

1001
01:01:15.276 --> 01:01:17.608
Why is Jiseok not seeing anyone?

1002
01:01:17.612 --> 01:01:19.773
Yes, where did Jiseok go?

1003
01:01:21.115 --> 01:01:22.275
coming

1004
01:01:25.620 --> 01:01:27.110
Come over

1005
01:01:27.121 --> 01:01:29.282
What are these?

1006
01:01:29.957 --> 01:01:33.120
Are those made by Eun Young?

1007
01:01:33.127 --> 01:01:34.788
Where can I cook?

1008
01:01:34.796 --> 01:01:36.286
I found a gourmet restaurant

1009
01:01:36.297 --> 01:01:37.958
Why should you buy it

1010
01:01:37.965 --> 01:01:40.957
Mother makes some meals

1011
01:01:41.803 --> 01:01:44.465
On dad's birthday, mom will cook

1012
01:01:44.472 --> 01:01:47.305
Mother ’s birthday

1013
01:01:47.308 --> 01:01:48.297
Isn't it good

1014
01:01:48.309 --> 01:01:50.971
Yeah, the eldest daughter is the best

1015
01:01:53.481 --> 01:01:54.971
Jiseok, come here.

1016
01:01:57.819 --> 01:02:00.481
The daughters of this family are really special

1017
01:02:00.488 --> 01:02:02.479
Just order takeaway.

1018
01:02:02.490 --> 01:02:05.823
Why are you asking your younger brother to move things?

1019
01:02:06.828 --> 01:02:10.320
Where is he young? He is over thirty

1020
01:02:10.331 --> 01:02:13.664
Even if you have gray hair, youngest is the youngest.

1021
01:02:13.668 --> 01:02:15.329
You don’t know how to cherish your brother

1022
01:02:15.336 --> 01:02:16.837
Aunt, then me

1023
01:02:17.672 --> 01:02:19.503
I'll have a daughter too

1024
01:02:19.507 --> 01:02:20.997
Sons are useless

1025
01:02:21.008 --> 01:02:23.169
Watch them set the table for mom

1026
01:02:23.177 --> 01:02:24.838
So filial

1027
01:02:30.852 --> 01:02:33.013
Eun Young, aren't you planning to get married?

1028
01:02:33.020 --> 01:02:34.351
Aunt, stop talking.

1029
01:02:36.357 --> 01:02:40.020
It's good now. What should I do in the future?

1030
01:02:40.528 --> 01:02:43.361
Able to live by myself

1031
01:02:43.364 --> 01:02:45.195
Regardless of ability

1032
01:02:45.199 --> 01:02:47.531
I can live well by myself

1033
01:02:47.535 --> 01:02:51.869
You are so special

1034
01:02:51.873 --> 01:02:53.534
She is special

1035
01:02:53.541 --> 01:02:54.872
mom

1036
01:02:56.043 --> 01:03:01.037
No, I mean you are exceptional

1037
01:03:03.384 --> 01:03:04.885
Go to the dining table

1038
01:03:09.724 --> 01:03:10.554
Jiseok

1039
01:03:10.558 --> 01:03:11.718
Ok

1040
01:03:14.896 --> 01:03:17.387
What happened?
As soon as you wake up

1041
01:03:17.398 --> 01:03:18.729
Are you awake then? 

1042
01:03:19.734 --> 01:03:21.065
This this

1043
01:03:21.068 --> 01:03:22.729
Really

1044
01:03:28.409 --> 01:03:29.740
I haven't seen aunt for a long time

1045
01:03:29.744 --> 01:03:31.405
a bit tired

1046
01:03:31.412 --> 01:03:33.573
I said a family had a simple meal

1047
01:03:33.581 --> 01:03:35.412
Anyway, she has a lot to do

1048
01:03:35.416 --> 01:03:37.407
Unnie, you don't let it go

1049
01:03:37.418 --> 01:03:38.749
Aren't you tired?

1050
01:03:39.420 --> 01:03:40.250
Is this coffee?

1051
01:03:40.254 --> 01:03:42.745
I said, am I tired?

1052
01:03:42.757 --> 01:03:44.918
But what should I do to fight back?

1053
01:03:44.926 --> 01:03:47.417
Hey, isn't there that kind of character in the game?

1054
01:03:47.428 --> 01:03:49.419
The more they are beaten, the more the energy value rises

1055
01:03:50.765 --> 01:03:53.256
I asked them to play a role called Teacher Kim

1056
01:03:53.935 --> 01:03:55.266
Fun

1057
01:03:55.269 --> 01:03:58.261
People hit you like this

1058
01:04:01.442 --> 01:04:02.431


1059
01:04:02.944 --> 01:04:06.778
What's wrong with Jiseok?

1060
01:04:06.781 --> 01:04:08.612
How did you grow up like this?

1061
01:04:08.616 --> 01:04:10.777
Very cute

1062
01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:14.621
I miss grandma

1063
01:04:15.122 --> 01:04:18.114
How grandma doted on you..

1064
01:04:18.125 --> 01:04:21.117
She always say our Jiseok, our Jiseok

1065
01:04:21.128 --> 01:04:24.962
But our Jiseok
Grow up into a nice man

1066
01:04:24.966 --> 01:04:26.797
Are you popular?

1067
01:04:26.801 --> 01:04:27.961
I think so.

1068
01:04:29.637 --> 01:04:30.797
Kneel

1069
01:04:30.805 --> 01:04:31.794
What?

1070
01:04:31.806 --> 01:04:33.967
You made me

1071
01:04:33.975 --> 01:04:35.465


1072
01:04:35.476 --> 01:04:36.465
kneel

1073
01:04:37.311 --> 01:04:38.300
Ouch

1074
01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:41.971
It's so painful, Kim Eun Young.

1075
01:04:41.983 --> 01:04:43.974
What are the children doing?

1076
01:04:43.985 --> 01:04:45.145
Aunts are going back

1077
01:04:45.152 --> 01:04:46.653
OK, coming out now

1078
01:04:48.823 --> 01:04:48.982


1079
01:04:48.990 --> 01:04:49.149


1080
01:04:49.156 --> 01:04:49.315


1081
01:04:49.323 --> 01:04:49.482


1082
01:04:49.490 --> 01:04:49.649


1083
01:04:49.657 --> 01:04:49.816


1084
01:04:49.824 --> 01:04:49.983


1085
01:04:49.991 --> 01:04:50.150


1086
01:04:50.157 --> 01:04:50.316


1087
01:04:50.324 --> 01:04:50.483


1088
01:04:50.491 --> 01:04:51.150
Oops

1089
01:04:51.993 --> 01:04:53.824
I kicked them

1090
01:04:53.828 --> 01:04:55.489
Then he got on his knees

1091
01:04:55.663 --> 01:04:55.822


1092
01:04:55.830 --> 01:04:55.989
Unnie

1093
01:04:55.997 --> 01:04:57.328
Kim Eun Young, you really are

1094
01:04:57.331 --> 01:04:58.662
Be careful

1095
01:04:58.666 --> 01:05:00.497
This impulse will cause something big

1096
01:05:01.335 --> 01:05:03.667
I don't want to see you

1097
01:05:04.505 --> 01:05:06.496
Are you worried about me

1098
01:05:06.507 --> 01:05:09.340
Oh, you don't have to worry

1099
01:05:09.343 --> 01:05:11.334
I'm strong against that kind of person

1100
01:05:11.345 --> 01:05:13.677
Yes, when my Unnie was in high school

1101
01:05:13.681 --> 01:05:16.343
Partnered with friends to catch a seductive boat

1102
01:05:16.350 --> 01:05:20.343
Yeah, I caught him and gave him to the police.

1103
01:05:20.354 --> 01:05:22.686
Then I was taught a hard meal by the teachers

1104
01:05:22.690 --> 01:05:24.521
Schoolgirl doesn't know me

1105
01:05:26.027 --> 01:05:28.860
I cursed those teachers

1106
01:05:28.863 --> 01:05:30.524
But I became a teacher

1107
01:05:31.198 --> 01:05:33.189
Unnie, didn't you want to go to normal university?

1108
01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:33.859
What resistance

1109
01:05:33.868 --> 01:05:36.530
Yeah, my mother said that because of the situation at home,

1110
01:05:36.537 --> 01:05:38.869
So I went to the normal school and cried for a long time.

1111
01:05:38.873 --> 01:05:40.204
Really?

1112
01:05:42.543 --> 01:05:46.035
My father retired because of the economic crisis

1113
01:05:46.047 --> 01:05:48.709
You still have to learn

1114
01:05:48.716 --> 01:05:51.207
It ’s a good choice in every way.

1115
01:05:51.218 --> 01:05:53.379
I'm sorry because Jiseok and I coaxed

1116
01:05:54.221 --> 01:05:56.052
What are you doing?

1117
01:05:57.558 --> 01:06:00.049
You also wanted to be a writer or reporter

1118
01:06:00.061 --> 01:06:02.222
After all, I'm looking for a job.

1119
01:06:02.229 --> 01:06:04.220
Each other is a concession

1120
01:06:05.566 --> 01:06:07.227
Sensible

1121
01:06:08.736 --> 01:06:11.398
No I'm eating rice cake

1122
01:06:12.239 --> 01:06:13.900
Really naive

1123
01:06:21.248 --> 01:06:22.749
Do the students hate my  Unnie?


1124
01:06:22.750 --> 01:06:25.913
No, my popularity is really strong


1125
01:06:27.922 --> 01:06:29.082
Who?

1126
01:06:32.593 --> 01:06:34.424
What's wrong with your expression?

1127
01:06:34.428 --> 01:06:35.929
You are good

1128
01:06:35.930 --> 01:06:38.592
Stop it.

1129
01:07:23.144 --> 01:07:24.475
How are you?

1130
01:07:24.478 --> 01:07:26.969
Good. How are you?
 

1131
01:07:26.981 --> 01:07:27.970
OK

1132
01:07:27.982 --> 01:07:31.975
How are you doing?

1133
01:07:31.986 --> 01:07:33.817
It's been 26 months now


1134
01:07:34.989 --> 01:07:38.322
Although it’s hard to raise, it’s very cute, right?

1135
01:07:38.325 --> 01:07:39.314
Yes.


1136
01:07:40.995 --> 01:07:41.984
Team leader


1137
01:07:41.996 --> 01:07:43.156
what?
 

1138
01:07:43.998 --> 01:07:46.831
Are you surprised that I sent you a message

1139
01:07:58.179 --> 01:08:00.511
Ok join

1140
01:08:02.183 --> 01:08:03.013
me?

1141
01:08:03.017 --> 01:08:06.009
Yes, it's exactly the same as the work in previous company

1142
01:08:06.020 --> 01:08:09.183
But the monthly salary is only 80% of your previous salary.

1143
01:08:09.190 --> 01:08:11.522
But I will give you a guarantee

1144
01:08:12.026 --> 01:08:16.190
Monthly salary is not a problem, can I do it well?

1145
01:08:16.197 --> 01:08:17.528
I haven't worked for several years.

1146
01:08:18.866 --> 01:08:21.198
How did you become a coward?

1147
01:08:23.203 --> 01:08:26.036
Our company is small, are you dissatisfied? 

1148
01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:29.874
No, you can invite me, I'm very grateful to you.

1149
01:08:30.544 --> 01:08:32.205
Let's work together

1150
01:08:32.212 --> 01:08:34.214
Ah thank you

1151
01:08:37.051 --> 01:08:38.882
I will work hard

1152
01:08:39.553 --> 01:08:41.384
Ji Young's graduation day

1153
01:08:42.556 --> 01:08:44.547
How can we stop business temporarily?

1154
01:08:44.558 --> 01:08:47.220
Why not just open at night?

1155
01:08:47.895 --> 01:08:49.385
I don't know

1156
01:08:49.396 --> 01:08:51.887
I won't go anyway, I can't get a job anyway

1157
01:08:52.566 --> 01:08:55.057
You kid, you will regret it later

1158
01:08:55.069 --> 01:08:57.230
No graduation picture

1159
01:08:57.238 --> 01:08:58.899
Forget it, I won't regret

1160
01:08:58.906 --> 01:08:59.736
Ji Young

1161
01:08:59.740 --> 01:09:01.241
Stop talking

1162
01:09:01.242 --> 01:09:03.403
Don't do anything if you are so sad

1163
01:09:03.410 --> 01:09:05.742
Just w ait to get married

1164
01:09:05.746 --> 01:09:07.236
This suits you

1165
01:09:18.425 --> 01:09:20.586
What did you just say?
 

1166
01:09:21.095 --> 01:09:22.084
What time is it now?
 

1167
01:09:22.096 --> 01:09:24.758
He said such a cliché

1168
01:09:24.765 --> 01:09:26.926
Ji Young, you can't be quiet


1169
01:09:26.934 --> 01:09:28.765
You need to be lively


1170
01:09:28.769 --> 01:09:30.100
Did you hear?


1171
01:09:30.938 --> 01:09:32.428

 

1172
01:09:39.279 --> 01:09:40.439
Damn


1173
01:09:41.949 --> 01:09:43.940
Give me water


1174
01:09:45.119 --> 01:09:46.108
Really

1175
01:09:46.954 --> 01:09:49.115
What are you doing?

1176
01:09:49.123 --> 01:09:49.282

1177
01:09:49.290 --> 01:09:49.449

1178
01:09:49.456 --> 01:09:49.615

1179
01:09:49.623 --> 01:09:49.782


1180
01:09:49.790 --> 01:09:49.949


1181
01:09:49.957 --> 01:09:50.116


1182
01:09:50.124 --> 01:09:50.283


1183
01:09:50.291 --> 01:09:50.450


1184
01:09:50.457 --> 01:09:50.616


1185
01:09:50.624 --> 01:09:52.455
Um, it ’s all right

1186
01:10:00.634 --> 01:10:01.965
Hey

1187
01:10:04.305 --> 01:10:05.795
Daehan Planning?

1188
01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:07.971
Ok

1189
01:10:10.311 --> 01:10:13.474


1190
01:10:18.819 --> 01:10:21.652
Mom, I'm qualified.

1191
01:10:21.655 --> 01:10:23.156
Really?

1192
01:10:24.658 --> 01:10:26.159
is it?

1193
01:10:27.494 --> 01:10:30.486
What should I do, Unnie?

1194
01:10:32.499 --> 01:10:34.000
Good

1195
01:10:34.001 --> 01:10:35.491
Dad, you don’t support me either

1196
01:10:35.502 --> 01:10:37.834
Let's eat

1197
01:10:37.838 --> 01:10:38.827
We eat

1198
01:10:40.841 --> 01:10:42.001
You eat meat

1199
01:10:44.178 --> 01:10:45.338
eat more

1200
01:10:46.180 --> 01:10:47.340
Ah  Unnie

1201
01:10:48.015 --> 01:10:50.006
I met Team Leader and talked about work.

1202
01:10:50.017 --> 01:10:52.349
OK, but can you

1203
01:10:52.353 --> 01:10:53.843
Yeah, you have to work hard to make it happen

1204
01:10:53.854 --> 01:10:55.515
Yeah, try to do what you can

1205
01:10:55.522 --> 01:10:56.352
Ji Young, come on

1206
01:10:56.357 --> 01:10:57.517
understood

1207
01:11:25.552 --> 01:11:27.383
Is it my birthday today?

1208
01:11:27.388 --> 01:11:28.878
what?

1209
01:11:28.889 --> 01:11:31.050
Oppa, I found a job

1210
01:11:47.074 --> 01:11:49.235
Is Ah Young going to work all day?

1211
01:11:49.243 --> 01:11:51.074
Let her stay in the kindergarten all day

1212
01:11:51.078 --> 01:11:53.069
I think Ah Young will be very uncomfortable

1213
01:11:53.080 --> 01:11:54.570
I inquired about Baoma group

1214
01:11:54.581 --> 01:11:58.745
Between five and seven
It’s better to hire a babysitter

1215
01:12:00.587 --> 01:12:02.088
And government support for childcare

1216
01:12:02.089 --> 01:12:03.420
But that waiting time is too long

1217
01:12:03.424 --> 01:12:05.085
I sign up first

1218
01:12:05.926 --> 01:12:07.086
Ok

1219
01:12:11.265 --> 01:12:12.425
Oppa

1220
01:12:14.268 --> 01:12:16.429
Don't you want me to go back to work?

1221
01:12:18.439 --> 01:12:19.770
No

1222
01:12:20.774 --> 01:12:22.935
I'm afraid you and Ah Young will suffer

1223
01:12:24.278 --> 01:12:25.768
Then I won't go

1224
01:12:27.614 --> 01:12:31.277
No, if you are happy, I am happy

1225
01:12:41.462 --> 01:12:47.298
Ji Young

1226
01:12:48.135 --> 01:12:50.126

1227
01:12:56.977 --> 01:12:58.478
Are you angry?

1228
01:12:58.479 --> 01:12:59.810
Yes, I am.

1229
01:12:59.813 --> 01:13:02.646
Why should you care about that?

1230
01:13:02.649 --> 01:13:04.640
I'm hungry, can you cook for me?

1231
01:13:04.651 --> 01:13:07.484
Cook for me. Cook for me

1232
01:13:07.488 --> 01:13:08.648
Really?

1233
01:13:09.490 --> 01:13:10.821
Why are you in the presence of your in-laws?

1234
01:13:10.824 --> 01:13:13.315
What about our family plans?

1235
01:13:13.327 --> 01:13:15.318
Adults love to say this

1236
01:13:15.329 --> 01:13:17.160
Because there is nothing to talk about

1237
01:13:17.164 --> 01:13:18.825
Get married early when we're not married

1238
01:13:18.832 --> 01:13:20.493
When married, they urge us to have children

1239
01:13:20.501 --> 01:13:22.662
Having a son, they urge us to have a daughter

1240
01:13:22.669 --> 01:13:25.502
Having a daughter, they urge us to have a son

1241
01:13:27.007 --> 01:13:28.668
I have a good way

1242
01:13:28.675 --> 01:13:29.664
what?

1243
01:13:30.344 --> 01:13:31.333
Let's eat first

1244
01:13:31.345 --> 01:13:33.006
Forget it

1245
01:13:36.183 --> 01:13:40.176
To be tossed every time I go home
Give birth to one

1246
01:13:40.187 --> 01:13:41.347
what?

1247
01:13:41.355 --> 01:13:44.518
We'll have one, and I will take good care of you

1248
01:13:45.359 --> 01:13:49.022
It ’s like buying watermelon and oranges in the supermarket.

1249
01:13:49.029 --> 01:13:50.690
Anyway, we have to give birth

1250
01:13:50.697 --> 01:13:52.858
Rather than being urged to live,

1251
01:13:52.866 --> 01:13:55.528
Have a child
It can't affect our lives.

1252
01:13:56.537 --> 01:13:58.027
Could it be so?

1253
01:14:00.207 --> 01:14:01.697
I will help you well

1254
01:14:02.709 --> 01:14:04.540
Hey

1255
01:14:04.545 --> 01:14:06.877
I change her diaper

1256
01:14:07.548 --> 01:14:09.709
I think I have to change a lot

1257
01:14:09.716 --> 01:14:11.217
What would you change, Oppa?

1258
01:14:11.218 --> 01:14:12.378
me

1259
01:14:13.387 --> 01:14:16.049
I will of course change

1260
01:14:16.056 --> 01:14:20.390
I have to go home early, can't drink, can't see friends

1261
01:14:27.067 --> 01:14:29.558
If the child looks like you, it will be cute

1262
01:14:29.570 --> 01:14:31.561
Forget it. I'm depressed

1263
01:14:31.572 --> 01:14:33.062
You are depressed because you are hungry

1264
01:14:33.574 --> 01:14:35.906
I have low blood sugar. Hurry up and cook for me.

1265
01:14:35.909 --> 01:14:38.070
Oppa, I'm really depressed

1266
01:14:41.748 --> 01:14:45.411
Oppa, what makes you uncomfortable?

1267
01:14:46.086 --> 01:14:48.077
What are you doing?

1268
01:14:49.923 --> 01:14:53.256
Oppa, are you okay?

1269
01:14:53.260 --> 01:14:55.922
Let's try my waist

1270
01:14:57.097 --> 01:15:01.090
Create a baby for me

1271
01:15:01.101 --> 01:15:02.762
Let's have a child

1272
01:15:06.773 --> 01:15:09.435
Hey really? hey

1273
01:15:10.944 --> 01:15:12.605
Is she still here?

1274
01:15:13.280 --> 01:15:14.941
Seems to be

1275
01:15:14.948 --> 01:15:18.111
She used to be responsible for her work

1276
01:15:18.785 --> 01:15:21.447
After maternity leave,

1277
01:15:22.456 --> 01:15:24.447
She came to slacking

1278
01:15:28.295 --> 01:15:30.286
Sorry, the child has HFMD

1279
01:15:30.297 --> 01:15:31.457
Can't get him to kindergarten

1280
01:15:32.799 --> 01:15:35.131
Report on the analysis of industry trends yesterday
  

1281
01:15:35.135 --> 01:15:36.466
Come here quickly

1282
01:15:38.639 --> 01:15:39.970
What is this?

1283
01:15:41.141 --> 01:15:42.802
Mom told you to be quiet

1284
01:16:11.004 --> 01:16:13.495
Auntie will come here in the future.

1285
01:16:13.507 --> 01:16:14.667
Got it?

1286
01:16:14.675 --> 01:16:17.166
Come see goodbye to diapers

1287
01:16:18.345 --> 01:16:21.007
Ah Young, try it too, goodbye diapers

1288
01:16:21.014 --> 01:16:23.175
Goodbye good job

1289
01:16:35.028 --> 01:16:37.360
I didn't make a call

1290
01:16:37.364 --> 01:16:39.855
Really?

1291
01:16:39.866 --> 01:16:43.029
Well, I think it’s the same result.

1292
01:16:45.205 --> 01:16:47.696
Recruitment website did not contact 

1293
01:16:51.211 --> 01:16:52.542
Let me see

1294
01:16:59.720 --> 01:17:00.880
Should I 

1295
01:17:02.055 --> 01:17:03.556
take parental leave?

1296
01:17:04.891 --> 01:17:06.051
Oppa?

1297
01:17:06.059 --> 01:17:08.550
I will take care of Ah Young for one year before returning to work

1298
01:17:08.562 --> 01:17:10.553
Will there be a solution at that time?

1299
01:17:10.564 --> 01:17:12.896
Next year, 

1300
01:17:12.899 --> 01:17:14.890
She will adapt, too.

1301
01:17:15.736 --> 01:17:18.398
It ’s all brought up like this
I went to primary school in a flash. 

1302
01:17:18.405 --> 01:17:21.238
Can Oppa's company take parental leave?

1303
01:17:21.241 --> 01:17:23.232
Since there is a system, we should make good use of it

1304
01:17:24.244 --> 01:17:26.906
Don't worry, do what you want to do

1305
01:17:26.913 --> 01:17:28.744
I also take this opportunity to read the book   

1306
01:17:28.749 --> 01:17:30.740
Learn a little bit more

1307
01:17:31.752 --> 01:17:32.912
Oppa

1308
01:17:32.919 --> 01:17:36.912
Right, are you loving me more and more?

1309
01:17:36.923 --> 01:17:38.754 
I became more handsome, right? 

1310
01:17:40.427 --> 01:17:43.419
Ah Young, mother can go to work now

1311
01:17:43.430 --> 01:17:45.261
Tell your mother, Fighting

1312
01:17:45.265 --> 01:17:46.425
High five

1313
01:17:46.433 --> 01:17:47.923
Good picture

1314
01:18:15.962 --> 01:18:17.122
So happy

1315
01:18:19.966 --> 01:18:21.957
Ah Young, do you think

1316
01:18:21.968 --> 01:18:23.799
mom should call grandma?

1317
01:18:26.473 --> 01:18:29.806
Yeah
Mother-in-law, the Chinese medicine you delivered is arrived

1318
01:18:29.810 --> 01:18:31.141
Eh yes hey

1319
01:18:31.144 --> 01:18:34.136
After taking the Chinese medicine you made for me, I will work hard

1320
01:18:34.147 --> 01:18:39.312
What job are you going to work?

1321
01:18:39.319 --> 01:18:40.820
Boss who worked together before

1322
01:18:40.821 --> 01:18:42.482
Invite me to work at her

1323
01:18:43.990 --> 01:18:49.155
What are you talking about?

1324
01:18:49.162 --> 01:18:50.151
Yes?
  

1325
01:18:50.163 --> 01:18:51.994
Hey are you crazy?
  

1326
01:18:51.998 --> 01:18:53.329
Isn’t it too much?

1327
01:18:53.333 --> 01:18:54.322
Mother-in-law is not like this

1328
01:18:54.334 --> 01:18:55.835
My son has a bright future

1329
01:18:55.836 --> 01:18:57.827
Why are you so impulsive?

1330
01:18:57.838 --> 01:18:58.497
Mother-in-law

1331
01:18:58.505 --> 01:19:00.996
Don't want to listen, you hang me up

1332
01:19:13.687 --> 01:19:16.178
Ah my dear, mother, hello

1333
01:19:16.857 --> 01:19:20.520
How much can a baby's mother go out to make money?
  

1334
01:19:20.527 --> 01:19:27.023
If she want to work, shs can have a part-time job nearby.


1335
01:19:27.033 --> 01:19:31.197
How can she ask her husband to take parental leave?


1336
01:19:31.204 --> 01:19:34.367
Isn't it too much?

1337
01:1 9:34.374 --> 01:19:36.035
Mother-in-law

1338
01:19:36.042 --> 01:19:38.704
Ji Young should learn from my family.
  

1339
01:19:38.712 --> 01:19:41.374
She also worked hard

1340
01:19:41.381 --> 01:19:43.372
Ji Young gave birth to the child.


1341
01:19:43.383 --> 01:19:45.715
It's Ji Young who brought her own child.

1342
01:19:45.719 --> 01:19:47.710
Go to each other to support the test of life,

1343
01:19:47.721 --> 01:19:47.880
help each other live

1344
01:19:47.888 --> 01:19:50.880
He is slacking and he also has problems at work

1345
01:19:50.891 --> 01:19:53.052
Ji Young is not feeling well.

1346
01:19:54.060 --> 01:19:56.392
It seems you don’t know the problem

1347
01:19:56.396 --> 01:19:59.888
Mother-in-law, your daughter is abnormal now.

1348
01:20:03.904 --> 01:20:06.737
Haven't you heard about the festival last time?

1349
01:20:23.590 --> 01:20:25.751
Yeah, how can you tell like that, mother?

1350
01:20:25.759 --> 01:20:27.249
Hey me

1351
01:20:27.260 --> 01:20:29.091
See you so anxious

1352
01:20:29.095 --> 01:20:31.928
Isn't this about you?

1353
01:20:31.932 --> 01:20:33.763
Till when are you going to hide?

1354
01:20:33.767 --> 01:20:35.928
Mom, can you do this if you are sick?

1355
01:20:35.936 --> 01:20:38.598
It's too sad for you to say this

1356
01:20:39.272 --> 01:20:43.265
Maybe you want to let Ji Young who is sick go out to work

1357
01:20:43.276 --> 01:20:47.269
Ji Young works outside if she faints.

1358
01:21:00.293 --> 01:21:03.456
Mom, why are you suddenly going to the second Noona's house?

1359
01:21:03.463 --> 01:21:05.454
You will close the store before you go back

1360
01:21:06.299 --> 01:21:07.630
Mom phone

1361
01:21:21.147 --> 01:21:22.307
mother in law

1362
01:21:44.004 --> 01:21:45.494
Ji Young

1363
01:21:54.180 --> 01:21:56.512
I'm thinking about mom

1364
01:21:57.851 --> 01:21:59.842
It's all a lie. Right?

1365
01:21:59.853 --> 01:22:01.684
what?

1366
01:22:06.192 --> 01:22:09.025
What are you doing, mom? Anything w rong?

1367
01:22:10.030 --> 01:22:13.864
Nothing

1368
01:22:15.535 --> 01:22:19.027
I just miss you

1369
01:22:19.706 --> 01:22:24.700
Ji Young, eat on time

1370
01:22:24.711 --> 01:22:27.874
You have to be healthy to do everything

1371
01:22:27.881 --> 01:22:30.543
Mom will sort it out as soon as possible

1372
01:22:30.550 --> 01:22:33.386
Come here to help you look after Ah Young

1373
01:22:33.386 --> 01:22:34.887
Go to work

1374
01:22:37.724 --> 01:22:39.885
Mom will help you

1375
01:22:42.062 --> 01:22:44.223
Do what you want

1376
01:22:47.734 --> 01:22:49.224
Mom left first

1377
01:22:52.572 --> 01:22:53.732
I'm leaving

1378
01:22:55.742 --> 01:22:57.232
Misuk

1379
01:23:06.419 --> 01:23:07.750
Don't do that

1380
01:23:16.262 --> 01:23:18.753
When you were in your youth

1381
01:23:19.766 --> 01:23:21.927
To take care of your Oppas

1382
01:23:23.269 --> 01:23:25.931
Stepping on a sewing machine in Cheonggyecheon

1383
01:23:26.606 --> 01:23:28.437
Thin face

1384
01:23:28.775 --> 01:23:31.437
Whenever you get your salary back on time

1385
01:23:32.445 --> 01:23:34.777
Mom's heart is like cut by a knife

1386
01:23:45.125 --> 01:23:47.457
You were too good

1387
01:23:56.803 --> 01:23:59.795
You got your hands back like that with a sewing machine

1388
01:24:01.975 --> 01:24:04.808
Don't mention how heartbroken I am

1389
01:24:09.149 --> 01:24:12.983
I couldn't hug you well

1390
01:24:14.320 --> 01:24:17.153
I couldn't say a word of thanks, Misuk.

1391
01:24:19.325 --> 01:24:20.826
Sorry

1392
01:24:24.831 --> 01:24:29.165
Ji Young, even if she works hard,

1393
01:24:29.169 --> 01:24:31.660
You made her strong

1394
01:24:47.187 --> 01:24:48.677
My child

1395
01:24:53.693 --> 01:24:56.025


1396
01:24:57.697 --> 01:24:59.858
my baby

1397
01:25:06.206 --> 01:25:09.698


1398
01:25:09.709 --> 01:25:12.041
Jung son-in-law, how can my child be like this?

1399
01:25:13.046 --> 01:25:16.709
How could Ji Young become like this?

1400
01:25:21.721 --> 01:25:23.712
Ji Young, yeah

1401
01:25:23.723 --> 01:25:25.714
Oh, Ji Young.


1402
01:25:27.227 --> 01:25:29.889
Ji Young


1403
01:25:34.567 --> 01:25:37.559

  

1404
01:26:10.103 --> 01:26:11.263
mom
  

1405
01:26:15.108 --> 01:26:16.769
What happened?
  

1406
01:26:20.113 --> 01:26:21.273
Jiseok scared me.
  

1407
01:26:21.281 --> 01:26:23.943
He call me and tell me mom's sick.


1408
01:26:24.951 --> 01:26:27.283
What happened at Ji Young's?

1409
01:26:30.456 --> 01:26:31.787
Jiseok?
  

1410
01:26:38.798 --> 01:26:40.129
Is this medicine for mom?

1411
01:26:40.133 --> 01:26:42.465
No, your mom drank another.

1412
01:26:42.468 --> 01:26:47.462
This is a good medicine for men

1413
01:26:58.985 --> 01:27:01.317
What is it?

1414
01:27:01.321 --> 01:27:03.653
What is this stuff?

1415
01:27:03.656 --> 01:27:06.989
Is there only a son in your eyes?

1416
01:27:06.993 --> 01:27:08.324
Because she can't do anything she want

1417
01:27:08.328 --> 01:27:11.320
Ji Young is almost becoming an empty shell.

1418
01:27:11.331 --> 01:27:15.825
You still carelessly whispered in a bag with a limb

1419
01:27:15.835 --> 01:27:17.666
Are you still a father?

1420
01:27:17.670 --> 01:27:18.500
What's going on?

1421
01:27:18.504 --> 01:27:20.995
All the elders opened his son's hospital

1422
01:27:21.007 --> 01:27:22.338
I helped line a box

1423
01:27:22.342 --> 01:27:24.333
So 

1424
01:27:26.012 --> 01:27:28.173
If you want to buy a box

1425
01:27:28.181 --> 01:27:32.015
Why not buy for the daughters

1426
01:27:32.018 --> 01:27:35.510
Can the girls not get sick?

1427
01:27:43.696 --> 01:27:45.357
My child

1428
01:27:47.033 --> 01:27:48.864
My child

1429
01:27:50.870 --> 01:27:57.366
Ji Young, Ji Young

1430
01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:16.221
Um all photos

1431
01:28:17.063 --> 01:28:18.394
What?

1432
01:28:19.232 --> 01:28:21.723
I need a box

1433
01:28:22.902 --> 01:28:24.733
My daughter

1434
01:28:27.240 --> 01:28:29.572
Can you help with me on Sunday? 

1435
01:28:29.575 --> 01:28:32.908
Of course you can be busy

1436
01:28:35.248 --> 01:28:36.909
Ji Young, are you uncomfortable?

1437
01:28:38.251 --> 01:28:39.912
Where I am not comfortable? 

1438
01:28:39.919 --> 01:28:42.080
Not looking well

1439
01:28:42.088 --> 01:28:43.578
Recently a bit

1440
01:28:49.929 --> 01:28:54.263
 Unnie, I'm afraid I can't go to Team Leader Kim's company.

1441
01:28:54.267 --> 01:28:55.928
Why is it because of the child?

1442
01:28:55.935 --> 01:28:58.426
Yeah, there is no place to entrust Ah Young.

1443
01:28:58.438 --> 01:28:59.598
What Dae Hyun said?

1444
01:28:59.605 --> 01:29:01.436
Oppa said he would ask for parental leave.

1445
01:29:01.441 --> 01:29:03.773
Then it's fine

1446
01:29:03.776 --> 01:29:06.108
But  mother-in-law said it wouldn't work

1447
01:29:07.947 --> 01:29:11.781
Ji Young, isn't this fair?

1448
01:29:11.784 --> 01:29:12.773
You are also like your husband

1449
01:29:12.785 --> 01:29:14.946
Read books, walk into the society and work

1450
01:29:14.954 --> 01:29:17.286 
OK, pregnancy can be said to be impossible

1451
01:29:17.290 --> 01:29:19.622
Children can always be born 

1452
01:29:20.460 --> 01:29:22.291
 Unnie, is that easy to say?

1453
01:29:22.295 --> 01:29:24.786
Actually, mother-in-law didn't say anything wrong.

1454
01:29:24.797 --> 01:29:27.960
I can't earn as much as my Oppa when I go to work

1455
01:29:27.967 --> 01:29:30.629
The money I made

1456
01:29:30.636 --> 01:29:34.800
May not be enough to pay Ah Young nursery and nanny salary

1457
01:29:38.811 --> 01:29:40.472
Really depressing

1458
01:29:58.498 --> 01:29:59.487
Wait a little

1459
01:30:00.166 --> 01:30:01.497
Come

1460 
01:30:40.206 --> 01:30:43.369
Just sleep

1461
01:30:44.043 --> 01:30:45.704
Noisy

1462
01:30:54.220 --> 01:30:56.882
I'm going to talk to Team Leader in person

1463
01:30:58.391 --> 01:31:00.723
That I can't go to work

1464
01:31:04.564 --> 01:31:06.555
Think about it

1465
01:31:06.566 --> 01:31:08.397
No way, can't it?

1466
01:31:12.238 --> 01:31:14.229
Tired before reinstatement

1467
01:31:20.413 --> 01:31:22.574
Yeah, take a break

1468
01:31:23.583 --> 01:31:27.917
You also rest
I'll get better when Ah Young grows up

1469
01:31:28.921 --> 01:31:31.082
Is taking care of the child resting?

1470
01:31:34.260 --> 01:31:35.750
But right.

1471
01:31:36.596 --> 01:31:38.587
I know this is not good

1472
01:31:39.432 --> 01:31:41.263
But I can't stop speculating

1473
01:31:42.768 --> 01:31:44.099
Is Oppa like mother-in-law?

1474
01:31:44.103 --> 01:31:46.936
Don't want me to go to work

1475
01:31:46.939 --> 01:31:50.102
Did you regret taking parental leave?

1476
01:31:57.450 --> 01:32:00.112
Ji Young, it's definitely not the case.

1477
01:32:00.119 --> 01:32:02.610
I didn't think about taking childcare too hard

1478
01:32:02.622 --> 01:32:04.954
I really said that for your sake

1479
01:32:04.957 --> 01:32:07.619
Stop talking about it for me

1480
01:32:08.628 --> 01:32:10.459
To be honest, I don't believe it

1481
01:32:11.797 --> 01:32:13.958
You, mother-in-law and my family are the same

1482
01:32:13.966 --> 01:32:15.797
It's none of your business anyway

1483
01:32:15.801 --> 01:32:17.632
It's only me in war

1484
01:32:19.805 --> 01:32:23.969
Ji Young, calm down and listen to me

1485
01:32:26.145 --> 01:32:28.477
Didn't I tell you to go to the psychiatry?

1486
01:32:32.318 --> 01:32:33.808
you.

1487
01:32:37.823 --> 01:32:39.654
I am sick now

1488
01:32:43.829 --> 01:32:45.820
What do you mean?

1489
01:32:54.507 --> 01:32:56.668
Does that make you feel relieved?

1490
01:33:00.012 --> 01:33:02.003
Where am I sick? 

1491
01:33:07.853 --> 01:33:16.022
Ji Young, you occasionally become another person.

1492
01:33:32.878 --> 01:33:34.869
Ah Young

1493
01:33:34.880 --> 01:33:36.040
What are you doing dear?  

1494
01:33:36.048 --> 01:33:40.382
Daughter-in-law, it's Dahan today

1495
01:33:40.386 --> 01:33:44.550
Although it's not as cold as Osamu, the wind is quite cold

1496
01:33:44.557 --> 01:33:46.718
wear more clothes

1497
01:33:50.229 --> 01:33:52.561
Honey, you look like mother-in-law

1498
01:33:52.565 --> 01:33:56.399
Are you here, grandma?

1499
01:33:56.402 --> 01:33:58.063
Stop bullying

1500
01:35:03.302 --> 01:35:04.963
What should I start with? 

1501
01:35:08.140 --> 01:35:10.131
As long as I get treatment, right?

1502
01:35:16.816 --> 01:35:19.307
Fortunately, Ah Young is still young.

1503
01:35:20.486 --> 01:35:22.818
If she is sensible, she will find me strange. 

1504
01:35:25.658 --> 01:35:27.489
It’s not often 

1505
01:35:28.994 --> 01:35:30.655
Only occasionally

1506
01:35:36.168 --> 01:35:38.159
You must be very hard, Oppa. 

1507
01:35:40.005 --> 01:35:41.666
I'm still scared of 

1508
01:35:44.844 --> 01:35:47.005
I'm afraid you have gotten sick

1509
01:35:52.184 --> 01:35:54.345
I always think you are like this because of marrying me 

1510 
01:35:56.522 --> 01:35:58.683
It's all because of me,   

1511
01:36:20.379 --> 01:36:22.210
Put straight into the refrigerator


1512
01:36:22.214 --> 01:36:23.545
Put it all together


1513
01:36:23.549 --> 01:36:24.208
  
Ok

1514
01:36:24.216 --> 01:36:25.046
give

1515
01:36:25.885 --> 01:36:28.046
Take it, be careful not to spill
  

1516
01:36:28.053 --> 01:36:28.883
Ok

1517
01:36:33.893 --> 01:36:34.723
Hey

1518
01:36:34.727 --> 01:36:36.058
Oh Jiseok

1519
01:36:36.061 --> 01:36:37.221
dad

1520
01:36:37.897 --> 01:36:40.730
Oh, I'm going to the second noona's house for a side dish

1521
01:36:40.733 --> 01:36:42.564
What, what

1522
01:36:43.736 --> 01:36:45.567
What does second noona like?

1523
01:36:45.571 --> 01:36:46.560
Ji Young?

1524
01:36:47.239 --> 01:36:48.740
She likes bean paste bread

1525
01:36:49.909 --> 01:36:50.739
Red bean paste

1526
01:36:50.743 --> 01:36:51.573
Oh

1527
01:36:53.746 --> 01:36:54.906
What is going on with these breads?

1528
01:36:56.081 --> 01:36:57.241
To give it to you noona.

1529
01:36:57.249 --> 01:36:58.238


1530
01:36:58.250 --> 01:37:00.912
You will bring things when you come to my house
It's like becoming a person

1531
01:37:25.444 --> 01:37:26.775
Do you want bread?

1532
01:37:26.779 --> 01:37:28.770
Ah Young doesn't like to eat bean paste bread

1533
01:37:28.781 --> 01:37:30.112
She doesn't like this

1534
01:37:31.116 --> 01:37:33.277
Do you say you don't like bean paste bread?

1535
01:37:33.285 --> 01:37:34.274
Eat

1536
01:37:34.286 --> 01:37:35.787
I just pull out the red bean paste

1537
01:37:37.623 --> 01:37:39.955
What the hell?
Dad said you like to eat bean paste bread

1538
01:37:39.959 --> 01:37:41.790
It’s you who like to eat red bean paste

1539
01:37:41.794 --> 01:37:43.455
I like cream

1540
01:38:02.314 --> 01:38:03.474
what is this?

1541
01:38:03.983 --> 01:38:04.972
Give it to you

1542
01:38:11.323 --> 01:38:12.654
Can I take this?

1543
01:38:14.493 --> 01:38:16.984
Or wait for you to make money
Buy me a better one

1544
01:38:24.503 --> 01:38:26.004
You know it's obvious that you're doing this

1545
01:38:30.676 --> 01:38:31.836
I'm leaving

1546
01:38:34.179 --> 01:38:35.168
Ah Young

1547
01:38:38.517 --> 01:38:40.018
Go After dinner

1548
01:38:40.019 --> 01:38:41.179
I have an appointment

1549
01:38:48.527 --> 01:38:50.188
Don't get sick, Noona,

1550
01:38:51.363 --> 01:38:53.695
I'll finally hear you call me as Noona   

1551
01:39:00.372 --> 01:39:01.873
Jiseok, thanks.

1552
01:39:02.541 --> 01:39:04.202
Next time I will buy cream bread

1553
01:39:36.408 --> 01:39:37.909
Finally met? 

1554
01:39:38.577 --> 01:39:39.737
That is, 

1555
01:39:39.745 --> 01:39:42.578
The sick person is me

1556
01:39:42.581 --> 01:39:44.412
I am the last one to know

1557
01:39:44.416 --> 01:39:45.917
How do you feel?

1558
01:39:45.918 --> 01:39:47.909
I heard if I scared you afterwards.

1559
01:39:50.255 --> 01:39:51.586
I’m so scaed.

1560
01:39:51.590 --> 01:39:53.091
You know when I'm treating a patient

1561
01:39:53.092 --> 01:39:56.084
What is the hardest process?

1562
01:39:56.095 --> 01:39:59.428
The hardest part is getting the patient to sit in front of me

1563
01:40:00.099 --> 01:40:01.259
To come here

1564
01:40:01.266 --> 01:40:03.427
Sitting in front of the doctor

1565
01:40:03.435 --> 01:40:06.097
It means the treatment was successful

1566
01:40:06.105 --> 01:40:08.096
Just listening to you say that

1567
01:40:08.107 --> 01:40:09.938
Also makes me feel good

1568
01:40:33.632 --> 01:40:35.623
Yeah mom

1569
01:40:36.135 --> 01:40:37.295
Are you in the shop?

1570
01:40:37.302 --> 01:40:39.964
Um just came out

1571
01:40:39.972 --> 01:40:42.964
What about you? Have you had breakfast?

1572
01:40:42.975 --> 01:40:43.805
Yes

1573
01:40:43.809 --> 01:40:46.471
I ate it with Ah Young

1574
01:40:46.478 --> 01:40:47.979
How about you?

1575
01:40:47.980 --> 01:40:50.141
Your dad's breakfast is always on time

1576
01:40:50.149 --> 01:40:52.640
I will of course eat it

1577
01:40:59.825 --> 01:41:00.985
mom

1578
01:41:00.993 --> 01:41:02.324
Yes?

1579
01:41:03.162 --> 01:41:05.995
Mom, do you remember

1580
01:41:05.998 --> 01:41:07.488
When I was born?

1581
01:41:09.501 --> 01:41:14.165
Then of course, how can I not remember it?

1582
01:41:14.840 --> 01:41:17.001
The day you were born

1583
01:41:17.009 --> 01:41:20.342
The cherry blossoms in the sky are beautiful

1584
01:41:20.345 --> 01:41:23.508
I hurry to pack up and go to the hospital

1585
01:41:23.515 --> 01:41:25.847
Cherry blossoms flying

1586
01:41:25.851 --> 01:41:28.183
It’s like snow and goose feathers

1587
01:41:31.356 --> 01:41:33.187
I may be with you

1588
01:41:34.860 --> 01:41:37.852
The day Ah Young was born

1589
01:41:37.863 --> 01:41:39.694
It's snowing

1590
01:41:40.699 --> 01:41:42.690
I gave birth to such a beautiful daughter

1591
01:42:33.085 --> 01:42:34.746
Too bad

1592
01:42:51.103 --> 01:42:52.092
Come

1593
01:42:53.939 --> 01:42:56.772
What is the name of our company?

1594
01:42:56.775 --> 01:42:57.935
Is it good with me?

1595
01:42:57.943 --> 01:42:59.103
Superb

1596
01:42:59.111 --> 01:43:00.772
Don't lie to me

1597
01:43:01.947 --> 01:43:03.437
What is this?

1598
01:43:03.448 --> 01:43:05.439
Wish you business

1599
01:43:05.450 --> 01:43:06.439
Thanks

1600
01:43:14.126 --> 01:43:16.959
What are you doing as a guest?

1601
01:43:18.463 --> 01:43:20.795
It's a ghost

1602
01:43:20.799 --> 01:43:21.959
What's up?

1603
01:43:21.967 --> 01:43:23.298
talk about it

1604
01:43:24.136 --> 01:43:26.297
Team Leader Kim, I'm afraid it's difficult.

1605
01:43:26.305 --> 01:43:28.466
Why didn't you hire a babysitter?

1606
01:43:28.473 --> 01:43:29.303
Yes

1607
01:43:35.314 --> 01:43:37.976
How about doing a part-time job?

1608
01:43:37.983 --> 01:43:39.473
That's not OK

1609
01:43:41.486 --> 01:43:42.817
I

1610
01:43:44.156 --> 01:43:45.817
Get treatment in psychiatry

1611
01:43:48.660 --> 01:43:50.821
This time

1612
01:43:50.829 --> 01:43:53.491
People who don’t go to the hospital are even better.

1613
01:43:53.498 --> 01:43:56.331
This job requires a lot of field trips and meetings
How dangerous

1614
01:43:57.502 --> 01:44:00.164
If I talk nonsense during the meeting
What should we do?

1615
01:44:03.508 --> 01:44:05.999
When I'm fine enough to come to work

1616
01:44:06.011 --> 01:44:08.002
I will contact you again

1617
01:44:22.027 --> 01:44:23.187
Dr. 

1618
01:44:24.029 --> 01:44:27.521
I think it's good to live like this

1619
01:44:27.532 --> 01:44:29.864
As someone else's mom

1620
01:44:29.868 --> 01:44:31.529
Someone else's wife

1621
01:44:32.704 --> 01:44:34.865
I feel happy sometimes

1622
01:44:36.208 --> 01:44:37.869
But sometimes

1623
01:44:39.211 --> 01:44:41.873
I feel like I'm locked in somewhere

1624
01:44:47.052 --> 01:44:50.044
I always feel over the wall ~

1625
01:44:50.055 --> 01:44:53.218
I should be able to find the exit, but still return

1626
01:44:54.559 --> 01:44:56.720
Even if I find another way, I still run into a wall

1627
01:45:00.232 --> 01:45:04.396
Sometimes I want to say
Is there no exit from the beginning?

1628
01:45:04.403 --> 01:45:06.394
I'll be angry for this too

1629
01:45:06.405 --> 01:45:07.565
Yeah

1630
01:45:09.408 --> 01:45:11.239
But then I understood again

1631
01:45:14.746 --> 01:45:16.907
Actually all this is my fault.

1632
01:45:18.750 --> 01:45:22.083
Others should also find their own exit

1633
01:45:22.087 --> 01:45:24.419
I am just incapable of myself

1634
01:45:27.759 --> 01:45:29.750
Just outdated

1635
01:45:29.761 --> 01:45:32.093
It's not your fault.

1636
01:45:32.097 --> 01:45:34.429
Then why only I live so embarrassed?

1637
01:45:38.103 --> 01:45:41.266
When you were angry before?
How did you do it?

1638
01:46:16.975 --> 01:46:19.637
Why do so many women bring children here?

1639
01:46:20.479 --> 01:46:21.639
Really noisy 

1640
01:46:21.646 --> 01:46:23.807
I have to find a child-free area in the future.

1641
01:46:23.815 --> 01:46:26.306
Where's the child-free zone?

1642
01:46:26.318 --> 01:46:27.808
It's really noisy.
  

1643
01:46:28.987 --> 01:46:30.648
Assuredly
  

1644
01:46:33.158 --> 01:46:34.147
Oh wait
  

1645
01:46:34.159 --> 01:46:35.649
Why not?
  

1646
01:46:35.660 --> 01:46:36.649
Ah Young
  

1647
01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:43.331
In trouble
  

1648
01:46:45.670 --> 01:46:47.001
What a nuisance

1649
01:46:47.005 --> 01:46:49.838
How good it is to drink at home?
yes
  

1650
01:46:49.841 --> 01:46:51.502
How can I clean this up?


1651
01:46:52.344 --> 01:46:54.005
Really a mother worm
  

1652
01:46:54.012 --> 01:46:55.843
Hello, people will hear
  

1653
01:46:55.847 --> 01:46:57.508
Mom Worm is Mom Worm
  

1654
01:46:57.516 --> 01:46:59.677
Hello, this is really speechless.


1655
01:47:01.353 --> 01:47:02.513
Let's go drink in the park


1656
01:47:02.521 --> 01:47:03.852
Will be a little cold there

1657
01:47:03.855 --> 01:47:05.356
Better than here

1658
01:47:10.862 --> 01:47:12.693
Yeah it's too noisy here


1659
01:47:12.697 --> 01:47:14.028
That is to say

1660
01:47:14.032 --> 01:47:15.192
Excuse me

1661
01:47:17.702 --> 01:47:19.363
Do you know me?

1662
01:47:19.371 --> 01:47:20.030
what?

1663
01:47:20.038 --> 01:47:21.699
Why am I the mother worm?

1664
01:47:22.541 --> 01:47:24.372
Let's go

1665
01:47:25.210 --> 01:47:27.041
I ask you why I am a worm

1666
01:47:27.045 --> 01:47:29.036
No, I didn’t tell you.

1667
01:47:29.047 --> 01:47:31.208
Who did you say that to?

1668
01:47:31.216 --> 01:47:33.707
Come here for some coffee

1669
01:47:33.718 --> 01:47:36.710
You meet me for only about ten minutes.

1670
01:47:38.390 --> 01:47:41.052
Just know how much you know about me?

1671
01:47:43.562 --> 01:47:45.223
What kind of things have I experienced?

1672
01:47:45.230 --> 01:47:48.393
What kind of people have you met?

1673
01:47:48.400 --> 01:47:50.891
Do you know what you think?

1674
01:47:54.406 --> 01:47:56.067
I have only seen you once
Would you like me to evaluate you too?

1675
01:47:56.074 --> 01:47:58.065
Tell me what kind of person you are

1676
01:47:58.076 --> 01:48:00.067
What does this aunt say?

1677
01:48:00.078 --> 01:48:02.239
But it’s what we said ourselves.

1678
01:48:02.247 --> 01:48:05.239
Since you said it yourself
Please don't let me hear

1679
01:48:06.418 --> 01:48:09.251
Why spend energy to hurt others?

1680
01:48:09.921 --> 01:48:10.751
Let's go

1681
01:48:10.755 --> 01:48:11.414
Go
  

1682
01:48:11.423 --> 01:48:12.082
do not talk
  

1683
01:48:12.090 --> 01:48:13.751
Just leave
go

1684
01:48:13.758 --> 01:48:14.588
Let's go let's go
  

1685
01:48:14.593 --> 01:48:15.753
Hurry up
  

1686
01:48:26.938 --> 01:48:28.929
mom

1687
01:48:31.109 --> 01:48:32.098
mom


1688
01:48:32.110 --> 01:48:34.101
Mommy mommy


1689
01:48:34.112 --> 01:48:34.942
