1
00:00:37,955 --> 00:00:41,485
I'M STILL HERE

2
00:00:48,537 --> 00:00:53,960
DURING THE MILITARY DICTATORSHIP

3
00:01:16,018 --> 00:01:18,688
Go, Marcelo! Go. It's doing well!

4
00:01:25,544 --> 00:01:26,584
Great, Eliana!

5
00:01:30,508 --> 00:01:31,858
Go, go!

6
00:01:37,306 --> 00:01:38,306
Yeah!

7
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:40,807
That's great!

8
00:01:41,936 --> 00:01:43,536
Let's go! Yes! That's good, team!

9
00:01:47,617 --> 00:01:48,993
Whose cur is this?

10
00:01:49,811 --> 00:01:51,295
Guys, take him away. Take the dog.

11
00:01:57,018 --> 00:01:58,185
Is he yours?

12
00:02:01,122 --> 00:02:02,562
Marcelo!

13
00:02:04,775 --> 00:02:06,402
Hold him. He's messing up the game.

14
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:08,855
- He is cute.
- Beautiful.

15
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:11,346
- You should stay with him.
- I cannot.

16
00:02:12,133 --> 00:02:13,133
Hold on.

17
00:02:14,118 --> 00:02:17,079
Do you know what that boy's name is?
Ah, Marcelo!

18
00:02:18,664 --> 00:02:20,332
Look how cute our new puppy is.

19
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:23,044
Mom will not let him stay.
He's a flea-ridden.

20
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:25,369
- Where's she?
- I don't know.

21
00:02:25,713 --> 00:02:27,089
Give me some.

22
00:02:27,923 --> 00:02:30,676
She'll kill us if we get tanned
at the ballet, isn't, Nalu?

23
00:02:30,843 --> 00:02:32,553
That's why rice powder is for.

24
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,060
Let's go, come on!

25
00:02:46,942 --> 00:02:48,736
Be careful on the street, Marcelo!

26
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,243
Let's go, let's go!

27
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:01,193
Excuse me, excuse me.

28
00:03:06,128 --> 00:03:07,588
Oh, no, guys. Please, clean your feet.

29
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:08,730
I just swept the floor of the house.

30
00:03:09,381 --> 00:03:11,383
He's cute. Let me hold it.

31
00:03:11,884 --> 00:03:13,552
- And what mean this, boy?
- Our new puppy.

32
00:03:14,236 --> 00:03:17,244
A filthy dog, Marcelo.
Does your mom know about that?

33
00:03:17,765 --> 00:03:18,849
Is my Dad here?

34
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:22,491
In the office with Mr. Bocayuva.
Don't bother him, Marcelo.

35
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,020
- It's urgent.
- Wait... Don't go, Marcelo!

36
00:03:30,069 --> 00:03:32,863
It was crazy that we accepted a
project of the size.

37
00:03:33,114 --> 00:03:34,865
If it was easy we wouldn't
take it, would you?

38
00:03:35,466 --> 00:03:37,932
- You would take it, I know you.
- Ah, I would take it.

39
00:03:38,702 --> 00:03:40,079
- Dad?
- Come in.

40
00:03:40,955 --> 00:03:44,041
No, no, no. Dog in the house, no.

41
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:47,628
- No, no way.
- Can we stay with him, please?

42
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:49,463
- What did your mother say?
- She said to ask you.

43
00:03:50,673 --> 00:03:52,616
What's this got to do with me? Look at this.

44
00:03:54,093 --> 00:03:56,720
Can you take it with you?

45
00:03:56,862 --> 00:03:57,862
Me? No way.

46
00:03:58,147 --> 00:04:00,741
I have a tunnel to build.
And Dalal will kick me out of house.

47
00:04:02,935 --> 00:04:05,740
I think this little rascal here.

48
00:04:07,373 --> 00:04:08,733
Will be called...

49
00:04:10,025 --> 00:04:11,819
- Pimpão
- Let me see it.

50
00:04:12,153 --> 00:04:13,154
I know how do it.

51
00:05:16,425 --> 00:05:17,927
Wait, guys.

52
00:05:18,677 --> 00:05:19,678
What is this?

53
00:05:20,179 --> 00:05:21,180
Put out this. Hide it.

54
00:05:51,543 --> 00:05:55,881
- <i>Lean against the wall, I command.</i>
- <i>I've already given you my IDs.</i>

55
00:05:56,173 --> 00:05:57,766
- <i>What more do you want?</i>
- <i>Shut up!</i>

56
00:05:59,343 --> 00:06:01,303
You in the yellow car!

57
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:03,863
Park here.

58
00:06:04,098 --> 00:06:06,225
Stop here, here.

59
00:06:08,452 --> 00:06:10,319
<i>To wall, fuck! Hand in the wall!</i>

60
00:06:10,604 --> 00:06:12,815
Turn off the engine.

61
00:06:14,525 --> 00:06:16,151
Put that fucking camera down.

62
00:06:16,485 --> 00:06:19,530
Come on, get out of the car.

63
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:23,257
To the wall.

64
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:25,553
Put your hand on the hood.

65
00:06:25,577 --> 00:06:28,080
Let's go, hairy one, to the wall.

66
00:06:28,998 --> 00:06:31,792
- Shit, man! That's not necessary.
- Be quiet there, girl.

67
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:35,754
Turn around.

68
00:06:42,177 --> 00:06:44,138
Where are your IDs?

69
00:06:45,055 --> 00:06:47,099
- Wait, no need to push him.
- Be quiet!

70
00:06:47,558 --> 00:06:49,852
I'll get them, they're in the car.
Can I take them?

71
00:06:49,977 --> 00:06:51,520
Move! Move!

72
00:07:10,956 --> 00:07:12,207
Get your hair out your face.

73
00:07:13,584 --> 00:07:15,127
Get your hair out your face.

74
00:07:26,722 --> 00:07:30,934
TERRORIST KILLERS WANTED

75
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:45,616
Twice, yes. Babiu, the first is silver.

76
00:07:47,409 --> 00:07:50,746
What time will Veroca arrive from cinema?

77
00:07:50,888 --> 00:07:55,624
Calm down, she's coming.
They went to drop the kids off at home, ok?

78
00:08:00,672 --> 00:08:02,132
Cuchimbas, turn up the sound.

79
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,596
<i>Giovanni Bucher has his car
intercepted on the way to the embassy</i>

80
00:08:07,888 --> 00:08:10,474
<i>shorty before 9am today.</i>

81
00:08:11,617 --> 00:08:16,033
<i>The kidnappers captured the diplomat
after injuring his security guard,</i>1

82
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:21,341
<i>who was shot in the back of the head
and is hospitalized in serious condition.</i>

83
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:23,668
<i>In a quick and violent action,</i>

84
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:27,382
<i>eight men and one woman used
a Willys Aero model car</i>

85
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:32,652
<i>to block his car in the Laranjeira
neighborhood, in the South Zone...</i>

86
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:37,557
- Didn't they let this guy go away?
- No, darling, that was the German.

87
00:08:37,935 --> 00:08:39,668
- This one's Swiss.
- <i>...People nearby said,</i>

88
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:45,465
<i>after they heard gunshots, they saw a
two-door Volkswagen passing very fast</i>

89
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:48,665
<i>heading towards Flamengo.</i>

90
00:08:49,071 --> 00:08:52,015
<i>Pamphlets were left at the
scene of the action, signed</i>

91
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:55,274
<i>by responsible organization
for the kidnapping,</i>

92
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:58,627
<i>that calls itself
"National Liberation Alliance".</i>

93
00:08:59,398 --> 00:09:01,608
- Ah, he's cute.
- But you won't take care of him.

94
00:09:05,737 --> 00:09:09,783
- What is this?
- I'm still shaking. It was fucked up.

95
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,205
What happened, girl?

96
00:09:11,493 --> 00:09:13,377
Watch your mouth, Veroca.
Where were you?

97
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:17,833
I went to drop Helena off at home
and we were stopped by the police.

98
00:09:18,267 --> 00:09:21,167
The cops were aggressive, searching everyone.

99
00:09:21,645 --> 00:09:22,685
It was awful.

100
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:24,398
Another ambassador was kidnapped.

101
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,420
- Another?
- Yes. We saw on TV now.

102
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:27,899
Oh, Mother of God.

103
00:09:28,003 --> 00:09:30,088
Luckily, Pimpão has his
father's BBA card in the car.

104
00:09:30,164 --> 00:09:31,832
What is BBA mean?

105
00:09:31,856 --> 00:09:33,856
That's why is good to have a
lawyer in the family.

106
00:09:34,675 --> 00:09:37,428
- I wish I had that luck.
- It's Brazilian Bar Association, honey.

107
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:41,315
- Want me to fix your dinner?
- No Zezé, I'm not hungry, thank you.

108
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:44,451
- Mrs. Eunice, this girl is not eating.
- You're screwed.

109
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:48,332
Listen, go to talk to your dad, he was worried.

110
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:49,422
Gimme.

111
00:09:50,124 --> 00:09:51,557
This ambassador situation is crazy.

112
00:09:53,143 --> 00:09:54,143
Veroca, Veroca.

113
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:57,045
Look! Dad call him Pimpão.

114
00:09:57,472 --> 00:09:59,152
- Don't tell him.
- Did he leave already?

115
00:10:00,142 --> 00:10:01,543
He promised me a ride in the Dodge.

116
00:10:01,793 --> 00:10:03,879
- Another day.
- Oh, Wallaby. No.

117
00:10:04,313 --> 00:10:06,548
You're not going to be riding
in that playboy's car, no.

118
00:10:07,566 --> 00:10:13,472
Funny, I thought playboys drank
whiskey and smoked cigars all day...

119
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:16,975
No, sweetie, I'm the guy who
pays for your mid-afternoon film.

120
00:10:17,618 --> 00:10:19,298
What did you go to see?

121
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:21,286
<i>Blow-Up.</i>
The sound was shitty.

122
00:10:23,376 --> 00:10:25,544
Your mom got nervous when
you disappeared like that.

123
00:10:25,561 --> 00:10:27,787
Dad, what do you intend to do?
Lock me inside the house?

124
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:28,490
Notify us.

125
00:10:28,572 --> 00:10:30,898
It's not my fault if
many soldiers are catching...

126
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:32,922
Who want coffee?

127
00:10:34,736 --> 00:10:36,488
Dad, how many prisoners did they ask for now?

128
00:10:36,514 --> 00:10:39,747
- I don't know.
- Everyone go to bed. Now.

129
00:10:39,771 --> 00:10:41,771
No, I wanna finish watching the news.

130
00:10:41,795 --> 00:10:43,795
No, no, no. To bed.

131
00:10:43,819 --> 00:10:46,019
Marcelo, the dog goes in the garage.

132
00:10:50,343 --> 00:10:56,243
I'll call Dalva to see if Helena
arrived well. Sounds like it wasn't pretty.

133
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:26,978
Today, Dalva insisted again that
we go to London with them.

134
00:11:28,602 --> 00:11:30,802
But then she offered to take only Veroca.

135
00:11:32,626 --> 00:11:34,326
It's good idea.

136
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:36,050
- Do you think?
- I do.

137
00:11:36,074 --> 00:11:38,074
Next year, she'll start college. So...

138
00:11:38,098 --> 00:11:40,098
What?

139
00:11:40,122 --> 00:11:43,922
Do you think there is no chance that
Veroca won't get involved in trouble?

140
00:11:43,946 --> 00:11:45,946
The way she is.

141
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:50,770
Let's wait. Let them settle down first.

142
00:11:53,088 --> 00:11:55,088
Then we'll see. No rush.

143
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:59,417
No rush? Why are Gaspa and Dalva leaving?

144
00:11:59,441 --> 00:12:02,541
Gaspa's paranoid. Thinks he's being watched.

145
00:12:04,157 --> 00:12:09,757
Let's send her to there.
At least until this phase is over.

146
00:12:11,319 --> 00:12:12,619
It'll pass soon.

147
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:17,993
Do you remember her in the macrobiotic phase?

148
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:19,715
Lasted two weeks.

149
00:12:20,282 --> 00:12:24,122
Yeah, but no one gets arrested
for being macrobiotic, Rubens.

150
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,140
You're right.

151
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:30,140
I will talk to Gaspa.

152
00:12:30,269 --> 00:12:32,269
- Yeah?
- Yes, it's gonna be okay.

153
00:12:37,003 --> 00:12:38,636
- Hello?
- <i>Hello. It's Rubens Paiva?</i>

154
00:12:38,823 --> 00:12:41,290
- Yes.
- <i>I came to deliver a delivery.</i>

155
00:12:41,713 --> 00:12:45,829
Work, I'll go pick it up in my office.
Do you hang up for me, please?

156
00:13:08,497 --> 00:13:10,497
...Belfim Moreira, 80.

157
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:12,666
Exactly.

158
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:16,561
No, you can leave this at the office.

159
00:13:18,632 --> 00:13:20,632
Exactly, in the Downtown.
Do you know the address?

160
00:13:20,656 --> 00:13:22,656
<i>I know, you'll want know a lot...</i>

161
00:13:25,597 --> 00:13:27,777
Alright, I'm turning off.

162
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:33,995
What is this squirrel doing awake?

163
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:37,661
- I smelled your cigar.
- A better nose than Pimpão.

164
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:42,764
What is this for?

165
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,812
This is for doing math, measuring a liar's nose.

166
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:51,259
Who were you talking to?

167
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:56,386
Dad's on a secret mission.
Do you know what it is?

168
00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:00,426
I conclude that you have no chance
of winning against me at Foosball.

169
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:02,729
Your chances are zero.

170
00:14:03,277 --> 00:14:04,477
Can I prove that you're wrong?

171
00:14:04,803 --> 00:14:06,836
- Do you want to try it now?
- Come.

172
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:09,260
Won't cry so as not to wake all in the house.

173
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,483
- Wallaby, come please.
- I will.

174
00:14:11,632 --> 00:14:13,132
If you're going to cry, cry quietly.

175
00:14:13,562 --> 00:14:15,695
- Cry? I will not.
- Keep voice down.

176
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:19,037
- 1 vs 1. Dad?
- Let's go!

177
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,633
It's Brazil. Brazil knows.

178
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:23,678
Fuck, Marcelo! Go to sleep!

179
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:27,269
It's the beginning of the turning point. Come on.

180
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:30,981
Wash him properly, Marcelo. Wow, it's easy, guys.

181
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:33,468
Now he'll smell good.

182
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:38,173
You didn't answer me, eh?
Under your bed it's disgusting.

183
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:39,611
Because you slept with him dirty.

184
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,180
So, you slept...

185
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:03,252
You can meet an English boy.
Fall in love with the next John Lennon.

186
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,550
Guys, I'm going back to study Sociology.

187
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,096
But you don't have to decide now,
do you, sweetie?

188
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:12,946
Travel, enjoy it and when you come back, decide.

189
00:16:13,515 --> 00:16:14,875
I've already made up my mind, Mom.

190
00:16:15,684 --> 00:16:18,517
Rum raisin for my Mediterranean.

191
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:22,788
Very good. What did you call Mom?

192
00:16:22,974 --> 00:16:25,674
Son, it's a mix of Italian,
Spanish, Greek, and Turkish.

193
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:28,374
Your mother, the most beautiful
woman in the world.

194
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:29,738
Me.

195
00:16:31,383 --> 00:16:34,883
Veroca, Veroca. Find me an English boyfriend.

196
00:16:35,262 --> 00:16:37,082
- You can't date yet.
- Of course, I can date.

197
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:39,344
Veroca, will you miss me?

198
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:41,858
Of course I'll miss you, my love.

199
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:44,164
- And me?
- No.

200
00:16:47,293 --> 00:16:49,753
Oh, dear. Veroca. Poor boy.

201
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:51,793
I will, I will.

202
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,340
- This one is for you.
- Thank you, Dalva.

203
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:09,010
Veroca promised not to give you any trouble.

204
00:17:09,738 --> 00:17:11,604
She'll be no trouble at all.

205
00:17:12,157 --> 00:17:14,090
I can always go in her place.

206
00:17:15,118 --> 00:17:18,254
It's easier for me to take
the whole family there.

207
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:22,456
When our house is almost renovated,
we will travel there.

208
00:17:23,043 --> 00:17:27,715
Oh, please, Eunice. Once you move into
that house, you'll never leave Rio.

209
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:31,323
- Is this one for Babiu?
- Yeah, for Babiu.

210
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:33,609
And this one, I chose for you.

211
00:17:34,846 --> 00:17:35,846
Wow.

212
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:39,556
It's getting too dangerous here, Rubens.

213
00:17:40,185 --> 00:17:44,217
I won't wait to see it.
You should do the same and come with us.

214
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:48,078
I'm sending Veroca first to
see if it's not a scam.

215
00:17:48,777 --> 00:17:51,749
Offering shelter to an entire family in London?

216
00:17:52,489 --> 00:17:54,489
Hey, what is this? You are all my family, too.

217
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:03,260
You'll be back soon. To reopen the
bookshop and publishing house.

218
00:18:05,877 --> 00:18:07,810
It won't be long, you'll see.

219
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:12,297
Son of bitch.

220
00:18:16,588 --> 00:18:18,655
- I love you, man.
- I love you.

221
00:18:43,915 --> 00:18:45,595
Are you taking that all?

222
00:18:46,251 --> 00:18:47,371
Just this one.

223
00:18:50,421 --> 00:18:52,101
- Take it.
- Seriously?

224
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:55,116
Just don't let Eliana touch it.

225
00:18:58,972 --> 00:18:59,972
Vera?

226
00:19:01,099 --> 00:19:02,099
Yay.

227
00:19:04,586 --> 00:19:06,266
Don't spend this on disks, ok?

228
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:11,171
There you can buy a pair of boots, as good
boots are essential for the cold.

229
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:12,484
Thank you.

230
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:15,645
Mom, do you still have that brown coat?

231
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:18,756
- Which one?
- The fur-lined one.

232
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:25,509
- This one.
- This one.

233
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:30,910
- But it's so old.
- It's new yet.

234
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:35,940
A gift from your dad. Honeymoon in Bariloche.

235
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:38,039
Can I borrow it?

236
00:19:46,144 --> 00:19:51,964
You'd better behave there.
Dalva has enough on her mind.

237
00:19:52,567 --> 00:19:54,634
I can take care of myself, Mom.

238
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:59,446
All right. Take care of my coat,
then, I'll want it back.

239
00:19:59,991 --> 00:20:00,991
I promise.

240
00:20:03,578 --> 00:20:07,738
Don't run off right away.
I'll make a soufflé for you, young lady.

241
00:20:09,392 --> 00:20:10,392
Nalu!

242
00:20:12,295 --> 00:20:13,655
Come on! Come on!

243
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:19,676
Goal!

244
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:22,971
It's a goal!

245
00:20:25,225 --> 00:20:26,225
Look at him.

246
00:21:07,942 --> 00:21:10,378
Do you know if someone's
interested in this house?

247
00:21:10,445 --> 00:21:11,445
You, right?

248
00:21:11,505 --> 00:21:14,961
I'm looking for a place like
this, here, in South Zone.

249
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:20,984
Rubens hasn't even started the new house.
But I can introduce you to a great realtor.

250
00:21:21,531 --> 00:21:25,051
I want to. Our townhouse can't
handle the new students.

251
00:21:25,702 --> 00:21:28,630
I don't know how Dalal manages
to run a school alone.

252
00:21:29,047 --> 00:21:31,147
I don't have five children, right, Eunice?

253
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:33,757
- She has six if we count...
- Rubens.

254
00:21:34,669 --> 00:21:39,657
What a delicious smell. How do
you keep it from sticking to the pan?

255
00:21:40,842 --> 00:21:45,962
Beatriz I told you. You run a knife around
the edge, put it in a very hot oven and

256
00:21:46,865 --> 00:21:48,545
don't open it, that's it.

257
00:21:48,633 --> 00:21:50,333
- I can't believe.
- It's true.

258
00:21:50,527 --> 00:21:55,135
Look how sweet the girls are dancing.
It's good they don't understand French.

259
00:22:02,589 --> 00:22:05,589
- Did you see your sister?
- Isn't she in her room?

260
00:22:05,617 --> 00:22:07,837
- Take your hand off your mouth.
- It's already falling.

261
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:09,970
Let it fall on its own. Is anyone up there?

262
00:22:10,621 --> 00:22:11,621
No.

263
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:15,800
Brasília is a ticking time bomb.

264
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:18,469
The military will hit hard.

265
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:22,170
Seventy prisoners for an ambassador,
they're playing with fire.

266
00:22:23,193 --> 00:22:24,993
How are the things at the newspaper?

267
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,780
Worse by the day.

268
00:22:27,163 --> 00:22:30,243
I've never see a lot of people
exchanged for an ambassador.

269
00:22:30,401 --> 00:22:32,821
If they let these people go,
are they going to kill him?

270
00:22:36,022 --> 00:22:37,022
No, honey.

271
00:22:37,666 --> 00:22:41,110
I bet right now the ambassador is comfortable.

272
00:22:43,112 --> 00:22:45,846
- And he is.
- With a Moët & Chandon.

273
00:22:50,661 --> 00:22:52,995
Soufflé's in the oven. Who's hungry?

274
00:22:54,415 --> 00:22:56,149
Soufflé with Swiss cheese.

275
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:02,095
Eliana, wet bikini in the couch? Go change.

276
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:03,899
- It's too hot.
- No.

277
00:23:04,384 --> 00:23:06,448
- I told her. She doesn't listen.
- Veroca is not here.

278
00:23:06,511 --> 00:23:07,411
Never mind.

279
00:23:07,656 --> 00:23:09,789
Yesterday I nearly broke my arm.
When I was playing with them.

280
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:14,558
- I fell on my arm.
- Son, your stories are long and confusing.

281
00:23:15,253 --> 00:23:17,986
Tell this story for your father's honor.

282
00:23:18,265 --> 00:23:19,265
I'll ask for a blessing.

283
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:25,018
This girl is calmer, but this one I will...

284
00:23:27,716 --> 00:23:29,396
Have you ever repeated.

285
00:23:33,371 --> 00:23:35,971
Maybe I'll have to ask my old man to go.

286
00:23:47,844 --> 00:23:50,744
Dad, isn't this my party?
I get to pick the music.

287
00:23:51,722 --> 00:23:54,322
What is this peace and love
girl complaining about?

288
00:23:55,468 --> 00:23:57,735
You'll get tired of foreign music.
Shall we dance?

289
00:23:58,339 --> 00:24:00,039
Can I dance with this young lady?

290
00:24:00,131 --> 00:24:02,687
- Why are you asking him?
- I'm asking. Shall we dance?

291
00:24:03,276 --> 00:24:04,276
No way.

292
00:25:13,513 --> 00:25:16,521
Can you believe our Veroca's going away, alone?

293
00:25:17,475 --> 00:25:19,475
Soon it'll be just you and me.

294
00:25:24,982 --> 00:25:26,422
My tooth fell out!

295
00:25:35,826 --> 00:25:36,866
Babiu! Babiu!

296
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:44,250
Dad, what if someone finds it?

297
00:25:44,343 --> 00:25:46,643
Baby, not a chance. Look at
the size of the beach.

298
00:25:47,506 --> 00:25:49,186
What if we don't find it?

299
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:52,859
We will. I counted the steps from home to here.

300
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:05,328
Get ready, let's take a photo. Babiu! Babiu!

301
00:26:08,025 --> 00:26:10,292
Come, let's take a photo. Come here, Rubens.

302
00:26:10,404 --> 00:26:12,337
Get closer. Closer.

303
00:26:12,931 --> 00:26:14,031
Go, Rubens.

304
00:26:15,333 --> 00:26:18,213
Let's go, let's go. Come here, come here.

305
00:26:22,415 --> 00:26:23,815
Eunice, no, no. Let me do it.

306
00:26:23,967 --> 00:26:25,334
You have to be in the photo.

307
00:26:25,376 --> 00:26:26,656
- Really?
- Sure.

308
00:26:27,378 --> 00:26:28,378
Let's go.

309
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:31,519
Attention, get ready.

310
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:34,408
Nobody serious, okay? Go.

311
00:26:35,553 --> 00:26:37,819
Attention. "Ditch the Ditchtators"!

312
00:26:39,348 --> 00:26:41,028
One, two, three, and...

313
00:27:02,413 --> 00:27:03,933
I'll take it, Zezé.

314
00:27:06,417 --> 00:27:07,417
Hello?

315
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:10,029
He's not at home.

316
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:12,130
Who is it?

317
00:27:16,469 --> 00:27:17,469
Hello?

318
00:27:42,203 --> 00:27:44,469
Rubens, someone left this for you.

319
00:27:46,082 --> 00:27:47,762
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

320
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:55,807
TO RUBENS PAIVA
FROM VERA LENNON

321
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:12,626
"Guys, this is not just a letter, is a sensory
experience like the <i>Mutantes</i> concert."

322
00:28:15,736 --> 00:28:20,970
"This is our street, it's very funny
like <i>Blow-Up</i>. All the houses are similar."

323
00:28:22,618 --> 00:28:23,618
Me and the chimney.

324
00:28:25,246 --> 00:28:30,110
"Just the doors are different. It's kind
weird to spend Christmas without a beach."

325
00:28:30,769 --> 00:28:34,337
"But we discovered that there
are how to have fun in the cold."

326
00:28:34,589 --> 00:28:35,669
"We even made a snowman."

327
00:28:36,382 --> 00:28:40,222
- Look, it's Dalva!
- "Remind you of someone?"

328
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:48,350
"And how about this street? It was so exciting."

329
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:56,088
"Nalu. Can you believe my feet touched
the same ground as John Lennon?"

330
00:28:57,611 --> 00:28:59,839
"Hard to believe the Beatles
ever recorded here..."

331
00:29:00,231 --> 00:29:01,351
The bus, watch out!

332
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:06,456
- Look, my English boyfriend!
- You don't speak English, right?

333
00:29:10,708 --> 00:29:14,548
"Look at this musical shop.
I could camp out here."

334
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:20,862
"We stayed until closing.
I only bought one single, okay, Mom?"

335
00:29:23,137 --> 00:29:25,070
"It's not for me. It's for...

336
00:29:25,347 --> 00:29:26,347
Pimpão".

337
00:29:26,416 --> 00:29:30,256
- If it's any consolation.
- "He will enjoy this glam rock stuff".

338
00:29:31,289 --> 00:29:38,189
"I hope you're all well. Kisses,
miss you all, Vera 'Lennon'."

339
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:47,017
- Put it on again.
- Again?

340
00:29:47,828 --> 00:29:49,628
Wait, I'll rewind the tape.

341
00:29:49,915 --> 00:29:51,115
It's rewinding.

342
00:29:52,666 --> 00:29:54,346
Wait. Okay. It's done.

343
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:57,263
- Can I read this time, Dad?
- Yes, darling. Sure.

344
00:29:57,772 --> 00:29:58,892
- Ready?
- Can I go?

345
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:01,090
- Wait, I'll turn it off here.
- Can I start?

346
00:30:03,394 --> 00:30:06,994
"This is our house, it is very funny
because it's the same as others."

347
00:30:08,682 --> 00:30:14,290
"Really similar, like that ones in <i>Blow-Up</i>.
Just the doors are different."

348
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:17,340
Wait, just a second.

349
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:20,337
Get out of the way.

350
00:30:21,496 --> 00:30:23,896
"It's kind weird to spend
Christmas without the beach."

351
00:30:24,323 --> 00:30:27,303
"But snow is cool, too.
We even made our first snowman."

352
00:30:28,744 --> 00:30:29,744
"Remind you of someone?"

353
00:30:31,872 --> 00:30:33,272
"And how about this street?"

354
00:30:48,823 --> 00:30:52,791
If I don't organize these photos
I'll end up confusing myself.

355
00:30:55,271 --> 00:30:58,727
Love, can't we put air conditioning
in the kids' room?

356
00:30:59,441 --> 00:31:01,375
No. The house will be breezy.

357
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:05,745
There's a cobego wall, a big veranda.

358
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,467
- Pick it up, honey.
- I'm playing.

359
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:18,626
Hello?

360
00:31:21,422 --> 00:31:24,622
That's right, at the corner of
Almirante Guimarães.

361
00:31:25,676 --> 00:31:29,576
We'll be here all afternoon. Thanks.

362
00:31:33,434 --> 00:31:35,634
Is there a good movie at the Pax?

363
00:31:36,145 --> 00:31:38,281
No. We have dinner at Dalal's.
Boca didn't say it?

364
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:40,280
We can go to the movies afterward.

365
00:31:43,152 --> 00:31:45,952
- Ready for backgammon?
- I'm always ready.

366
00:31:49,992 --> 00:31:52,859
- Where are you going?
- I'll prepare lunch.

367
00:31:54,113 --> 00:31:55,113
Mr. Rubens?

368
00:31:55,489 --> 00:31:57,222
There are some men here...

369
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:00,740
What's going on?

370
00:32:01,378 --> 00:32:03,058
Congressman Rubens Paiva?

371
00:32:03,714 --> 00:32:06,414
There must be some mistake, I haven't
been in Congress for years now.

372
00:32:06,609 --> 00:32:09,009
There's no mistake, sir, you're coming with us.

373
00:32:09,111 --> 00:32:11,244
- Where to?
- To give a deposition.

374
00:32:11,989 --> 00:32:12,989
It's routine.

375
00:32:13,158 --> 00:32:15,291
A deposition about what, Rubens?

376
00:32:15,319 --> 00:32:16,519
It's all right.

377
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:19,810
- I just need to change.
- Of course.

378
00:32:20,064 --> 00:32:21,064
Go with him.

379
00:32:23,734 --> 00:32:25,334
Anyone else at home?

380
00:32:27,655 --> 00:32:32,687
Just my children. They're upstairs.
There's no need for weapons.

381
00:32:58,327 --> 00:33:00,307
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, honey.

382
00:33:00,731 --> 00:33:01,731
Where's Daddy?

383
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:03,914
He's in the bedroom.

384
00:33:03,984 --> 00:33:05,884
I'll get a glass of water in the kitchen.

385
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,060
I'll get it for you, Cristina.

386
00:33:08,154 --> 00:33:09,154
Good morning.

387
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:14,325
- Dad?
- Hi.

388
00:33:15,536 --> 00:33:16,536
- Dad?
- Here.

389
00:33:19,432 --> 00:33:20,872
Can I borrow this?

390
00:33:21,884 --> 00:33:24,484
Sure. Take it.

391
00:33:27,548 --> 00:33:28,748
Give me a kiss.

392
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:36,246
Where you going all dressed up?

393
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:42,152
Up to the office for a bit.

394
00:33:42,271 --> 00:33:43,791
But it's a holiday.

395
00:33:45,315 --> 00:33:49,547
I'm just going to help these gentlemen.
I'll be back soon, sweetie.

396
00:33:50,288 --> 00:33:51,288
Okay.

397
00:34:18,266 --> 00:34:22,042
Honey, I changed my mind.
Sleep at Cris's house and tomorrow

398
00:34:22,436 --> 00:34:24,703
you can go to ballet together, right?

399
00:34:25,147 --> 00:34:26,147
Thank you.

400
00:34:27,066 --> 00:34:29,366
Cristina, tell to Sebastião show up later.

401
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:30,510
I will.

402
00:34:31,195 --> 00:34:34,395
- Can I go with him?
- Your husband will be home soon.

403
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:46,083
I'll be back in time for the soufflé.

404
00:34:56,011 --> 00:34:57,691
Where's the deposition?

405
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:00,180
I don't have that information.

406
00:35:27,042 --> 00:35:28,722
And what about you all?

407
00:35:29,419 --> 00:35:31,419
We'll keep you company, ma'am.

408
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:52,156
- Mom?
- Hi, son. Did you sleep well?

409
00:35:53,902 --> 00:35:55,422
Who are these guys?

410
00:35:55,696 --> 00:35:58,429
They're from pest control. Are you hungry?

411
00:35:59,449 --> 00:36:01,129
Come 're, eat something.

412
00:36:03,871 --> 00:36:04,871
Chocolate?

413
00:36:05,581 --> 00:36:07,261
Is my Dad at the beach?

414
00:36:08,208 --> 00:36:10,875
He went out for a bit. He will back soon.

415
00:36:22,097 --> 00:36:24,497
Mrs. Eunice, I'm a bundle of nerves.

416
00:36:30,939 --> 00:36:32,619
Where's the extension?

417
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:35,683
One in the office and another upstairs.

418
00:36:44,786 --> 00:36:48,114
If it's for your husband,
say that he's out of town.

419
00:36:52,628 --> 00:36:53,628
Hello?

420
00:36:55,172 --> 00:36:56,172
Hi, Dalal.

421
00:36:58,008 --> 00:37:02,168
Yes, but today won't work. Cuz' Rubens
has to travel at the last minute.

422
00:37:03,739 --> 00:37:09,439
No, it's not serious. It's a family
matter, he'll be back tomorrow.

423
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,120
Okay. Give Boca my best.

424
00:37:22,115 --> 00:37:24,182
We haven't been introduced yet.

425
00:37:26,161 --> 00:37:27,161
I am Eunice.

426
00:37:28,789 --> 00:37:29,789
Schneider.

427
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:33,517
Are you gentlemen staying for lunch?

428
00:37:34,169 --> 00:37:36,436
No need to bother.

429
00:37:37,297 --> 00:37:38,297
I insist.

430
00:37:43,108 --> 00:37:46,692
<i>...This wave of car thefts that's
taking over the city.</i>

431
00:37:47,307 --> 00:37:50,443
<i>A car with an open door is
an invitation to crime.</i>

432
00:37:59,695 --> 00:38:00,815
Babiu, eat it.

433
00:38:15,168 --> 00:38:17,702
What exactly do you do, Mr. Schneider?

434
00:38:20,173 --> 00:38:21,853
I'm a parapsychologist.

435
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,240
A parapsychologist?

436
00:38:30,284 --> 00:38:32,617
Mom, why's the house all closed up?

437
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:34,570
Eliena, go take a shower, and then have lunch.

438
00:38:34,723 --> 00:38:37,323
After the game. I came to get the ball.

439
00:38:37,483 --> 00:38:39,163
No, not now, sweetie.

440
00:38:39,609 --> 00:38:43,193
- What is this?
- No one leaves till your dad comes back.

441
00:38:43,949 --> 00:38:45,429
Where did Dad go, Mom?

442
00:38:46,366 --> 00:38:47,366
Let's go to your room.

443
00:38:47,409 --> 00:38:49,209
But Mom, they're waiting for me at the net.

444
00:38:49,229 --> 00:38:51,509
- You can play later.
- Mom, I literally have the ball.

445
00:38:52,539 --> 00:38:53,539
No, Eliana.

446
00:38:54,108 --> 00:38:57,384
Mom, what is going on? Who are these guys?

447
00:38:57,470 --> 00:38:59,762
- Why can't I go out?
- Eliana, they took your father.

448
00:39:00,222 --> 00:39:02,555
- Where to?
- I don't know, sweetie.

449
00:39:02,683 --> 00:39:05,915
They said he had to answer a
few questions. I don't know where.

450
00:39:06,161 --> 00:39:08,761
- Are they policemen?
- I think they're from the army.

451
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:13,919
Calm down, honey.

452
00:39:16,989 --> 00:39:18,308
Do you know if he's okay or not?

453
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:25,303
It'll be okay. Just don't tell the little ones.

454
00:39:38,001 --> 00:39:40,868
Babiu. Can you help me here in the kitchen?

455
00:39:41,338 --> 00:39:42,338
Yeah.

456
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,759
That's enough, Marcelo.

457
00:40:16,665 --> 00:40:17,665
I'm going.

458
00:40:18,417 --> 00:40:21,317
Go to room, your sister is already in bed. Go.

459
00:40:22,121 --> 00:40:26,153
- Tomorrow we'll finish.
- Tomorrow, these gentlemen won't be here.

460
00:40:28,301 --> 00:40:29,301
You won.

461
00:40:31,513 --> 00:40:34,380
Is there anything else I
can do for you gentlemen?

462
00:40:35,058 --> 00:40:36,958
There' food in the fridge, if you're hungry.

463
00:40:38,562 --> 00:40:40,828
We'll get by all right, thank you.

464
00:40:43,442 --> 00:40:46,642
Could you call and check when
Rubens will be back?

465
00:40:47,362 --> 00:40:49,629
It's getting late and I'm worried.

466
00:40:50,323 --> 00:40:52,257
I can't do that, unfortunately.

467
00:40:58,498 --> 00:40:59,778
Let's go up to sleep.

468
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:11,701
- Mom, they're armed.
- I know, darling.

469
00:41:12,137 --> 00:41:14,737
- Can I sleep in your bed?
- Best stay with your siblings.

470
00:41:15,015 --> 00:41:16,015
Please.

471
00:42:20,539 --> 00:42:24,123
Just a shift change, Mrs. Eunice.
You can go back to bed.

472
00:42:26,378 --> 00:42:27,498
I'm not tired.

473
00:43:36,031 --> 00:43:37,031
Eliana?

474
00:43:37,991 --> 00:43:38,991
Sweetie.

475
00:43:40,201 --> 00:43:41,201
Is Dad back?

476
00:43:41,679 --> 00:43:45,579
No, honey. We will make a deposition, too. Okay?

477
00:43:47,459 --> 00:43:48,459
Me too?

478
00:43:49,044 --> 00:43:52,444
Yes, honey. Wear this clothes.
Don't worry, we'll be back soon.

479
00:44:12,108 --> 00:44:14,642
Stay with the children for me, please.

480
00:45:25,598 --> 00:45:27,198
Put this on, please.

481
00:46:02,945 --> 00:46:04,325
Where is my daughter?

482
00:46:05,898 --> 00:46:08,765
Eliana's outside.
Sorry about the hood, Mrs. Eunice.

483
00:46:09,768 --> 00:46:11,288
Do you accept this?

484
00:46:12,604 --> 00:46:14,204
Where is my husband?

485
00:46:17,677 --> 00:46:20,665
CONFIDENTIAL SUBJECT
MARIA L. EUNICE FACCIOLLA PAIVA

486
00:46:20,737 --> 00:46:22,237
How long have you been married?

487
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:23,970
I want to see him.

488
00:46:24,141 --> 00:46:26,008
Here it says eighteen years.

489
00:46:27,285 --> 00:46:30,573
Was your husband already an ally
of the communists when you two met?

490
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:35,766
My husband was in the Labor Party.

491
00:46:36,878 --> 00:46:38,678
I'd like to call my lawyer.

492
00:46:40,582 --> 00:46:42,882
No need. These are just routine questions.

493
00:46:43,426 --> 00:46:47,266
I'll only answer after I've seen
my daughter and my husband.

494
00:46:51,612 --> 00:46:56,432
He's upstairs. He's already told
us everything he knows.

495
00:46:56,615 --> 00:46:59,559
- He's waiting for you to confirm.
- To confirm, what?

496
00:47:00,235 --> 00:47:03,151
That he left the country in '64 for
conspiring against the revolution.

497
00:47:09,035 --> 00:47:15,931
Rubens was a congressman.
He was ousted and had to go into exile.

498
00:47:16,126 --> 00:47:19,606
But since he came back to Brazil, he
hasn't been involved in politics.

499
00:47:20,171 --> 00:47:23,179
So why is he still fraternizing with terrorists?

500
00:47:23,667 --> 00:47:24,667
He's not...

501
00:47:29,472 --> 00:47:31,739
<i>Motherfuckers, you're gonna kill me!</i>

502
00:47:41,301 --> 00:47:43,841
We've been keeping an eye on
comings and goings at your house

503
00:47:44,487 --> 00:47:46,167
for a while, Mrs. Eunice.

504
00:47:46,906 --> 00:47:49,240
We like to receive friends at home.

505
00:48:02,755 --> 00:48:05,022
And are any of those friends here?

506
00:48:33,369 --> 00:48:34,369
No.

507
00:48:41,711 --> 00:48:48,483
Mrs. Eunice, I'm trying to make sure
you can keep taking care of your home.

508
00:48:49,886 --> 00:48:53,662
Driving your children to school
and playing your backgammon.

509
00:48:55,308 --> 00:48:56,428
That's my job.

510
00:49:04,093 --> 00:49:05,893
How's Vera doing in London?

511
00:49:06,986 --> 00:49:08,986
Did you do something to my daughter?

512
00:49:09,405 --> 00:49:10,872
- Did she do something wrong?
- No.

513
00:49:11,532 --> 00:49:12,799
So, there's no need to worry.

514
00:49:24,128 --> 00:49:25,648
Shall we try again?

515
00:49:31,094 --> 00:49:32,374
Who is this here?

516
00:49:34,806 --> 00:49:35,806
Rubens.

517
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:39,280
See? It's not difficult.

518
00:49:40,561 --> 00:49:42,241
Who else do you know?

519
00:49:45,608 --> 00:49:46,808
Look carefully.

520
00:49:53,825 --> 00:49:56,291
Martha, my daughters' teacher.

521
00:49:56,911 --> 00:49:59,244
I don't know what she's doing there.

522
00:50:02,834 --> 00:50:04,970
Martha was intercepted at the airport, yesterday.

523
00:50:05,586 --> 00:50:09,074
Her son provides logistics for the
subversives fleeing to Chile.

524
00:50:12,593 --> 00:50:13,760
It can't be the same person.

525
00:50:14,595 --> 00:50:16,595
She brought letters to Rubens.

526
00:50:17,181 --> 00:50:20,957
I want to know how he gets
those letters to the terrorists.

527
00:50:24,731 --> 00:50:28,443
I already told you. Rubens has
no connection to terrorists.

528
00:50:28,985 --> 00:50:32,057
Mrs. Eunice, you need to rethink your behaviour.

529
00:50:40,913 --> 00:50:43,180
Am I going to see my daughter now?

530
00:50:44,385 --> 00:50:46,452
- What is this?
- It's protocol.

531
00:50:48,379 --> 00:50:50,487
But you said that if I answered
I'd see my family...

532
00:50:51,424 --> 00:50:52,524
We're not done yet.

533
00:50:59,015 --> 00:51:00,615
Is my daughter here?

534
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:03,426
- Is my daughter here?
- Mom?

535
00:51:03,603 --> 00:51:04,803
- Eliana!
- What's going on?

536
00:51:05,688 --> 00:51:09,272
- Sit down. Be quiet.
- They'll ask you a few questions.

537
00:51:09,567 --> 00:51:11,367
- Then we'll return home.
- Ma'am.

538
00:51:12,487 --> 00:51:13,927
She's my daughter!

539
00:51:16,491 --> 00:51:17,611
She's just a child.

540
00:51:18,743 --> 00:51:19,783
Just a child.

541
00:51:45,128 --> 00:51:47,128
Don't let them do anything to my daughter.

542
00:51:48,314 --> 00:51:51,114
Be quiet. Otherwise you'll annoy them more.

543
00:52:26,936 --> 00:52:28,376
Eliana, your turn.

544
00:52:55,965 --> 00:52:56,965
Name?

545
00:52:58,509 --> 00:53:00,243
How long have I been here?

546
00:53:00,386 --> 00:53:01,506
Say your name.

547
00:53:03,055 --> 00:53:04,095
Eunice Paiva.

548
00:53:04,682 --> 00:53:05,682
Full name.

549
00:53:07,018 --> 00:53:09,551
Maria Lucrécia Eunice Facciolla Paiva.

550
00:53:11,314 --> 00:53:13,247
I want to talk to my husband.

551
00:53:19,197 --> 00:53:20,717
Look one more time.

552
00:53:33,995 --> 00:53:35,675
I told you, I don't know.

553
00:53:35,997 --> 00:53:38,264
I just wanted to change my clothes.

554
00:53:38,925 --> 00:53:40,045
One more time.

555
00:53:58,103 --> 00:53:59,103
My daughter.

556
00:54:00,105 --> 00:54:01,145
Where is she?

557
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:03,739
I don't have that information.

558
00:54:06,202 --> 00:54:08,135
Do you recognize anyone else?

559
00:54:24,512 --> 00:54:26,645
- Eliana?
- Don't talk, be quiet.

560
00:54:26,999 --> 00:54:27,999
Eliana?

561
00:54:29,392 --> 00:54:31,658
Your daughter is not here anymore.

562
00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:39,092
She only stayed one night.

563
00:54:39,169 --> 00:54:41,169
And how long have I been here?

564
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:43,120
- Five days.
- My husband...

565
00:54:43,999 --> 00:54:46,332
His name is Rubens. Did you see him?

566
00:55:50,139 --> 00:55:51,499
<i>Shut the fuck up!</i>

567
00:56:04,487 --> 00:56:05,487
<i>A doctor.</i>

568
00:56:06,405 --> 00:56:07,925
<i>They need a doctor.</i>

569
00:56:14,038 --> 00:56:18,074
<i>Stop. For God's sake.
I don't know anything!</i>

570
00:56:20,711 --> 00:56:21,711
<i>I'm afraid!</i>

571
00:56:47,238 --> 00:56:48,238
Full name.

572
00:56:48,739 --> 00:56:51,139
Maria Lucrécia Eunice Facciolla Paiva.

573
00:57:23,899 --> 00:57:25,259
Where am I going?

574
00:57:25,901 --> 00:57:28,385
I just want you to know, ma'am,
that I don't agree with it.

575
01:00:58,530 --> 01:00:59,530
Sweetie.

576
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:02,700
Come here.

577
01:01:09,792 --> 01:01:10,992
Where were you?

578
01:01:16,757 --> 01:01:17,757
Calm down.

579
01:01:21,970 --> 01:01:23,904
Do you want to eat something?

580
01:01:28,477 --> 01:01:31,910
Your mom, just need to sleep a bit.

581
01:01:35,234 --> 01:01:38,134
Okay? Tomorrow we'll wake up and eat together.

582
01:01:43,117 --> 01:01:44,797
Mom, what's happening?

583
01:02:04,263 --> 01:02:05,263
Eliana?

584
01:02:07,683 --> 01:02:08,683
Eliana?

585
01:02:12,438 --> 01:02:14,038
- What?
- Mom is back.

586
01:02:15,774 --> 01:02:17,974
- And Daddy?
- No.

587
01:02:20,821 --> 01:02:22,341
Is she in her room?

588
01:02:22,990 --> 01:02:24,856
She asked that no one should go in.

589
01:02:31,623 --> 01:02:33,303
Can I sleep with you?

590
01:02:35,878 --> 01:02:36,878
Yes.

591
01:03:14,792 --> 01:03:18,376
I wanted to wait for you there,
but they wouldn't let me.

592
01:03:18,921 --> 01:03:19,921
Sorry.

593
01:03:27,095 --> 01:03:29,029
Did they do something to you?

594
01:03:32,768 --> 01:03:36,164
They asked a lot of questions,
but I said I didn't know anything.

595
01:03:40,817 --> 01:03:42,617
Did you see your dad there?

596
01:03:47,324 --> 01:03:48,791
It's in the paper that he escaped.

597
01:03:49,743 --> 01:03:50,743
Escaped?

598
01:03:51,411 --> 01:03:52,811
But Lino said it was a lie.

599
01:03:53,705 --> 01:03:56,341
- Was Lino here?
- No, I heard it at Boca's house.

600
01:03:57,042 --> 01:04:00,946
I go there every day after school,
we were trying to find you.

601
01:04:03,590 --> 01:04:04,590
Don't, Mom.

602
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:08,288
It's better not to use the telephone.
Let's go, I'm gonna with you.

603
01:04:09,179 --> 01:04:10,613
No, Eliana. You will go to school.

604
01:04:11,390 --> 01:04:14,214
- But Mom, I want to know what...
- Eliana, you will go to the school.

605
01:04:14,810 --> 01:04:19,290
- Mom, I'm already helping them.
- Your mom is taking care of this now.

606
01:04:20,148 --> 01:04:21,268
- Mom!
- Mommy!

607
01:04:21,817 --> 01:04:22,817
My babies.

608
01:04:27,364 --> 01:04:28,484
Where's Daddy?

609
01:04:30,276 --> 01:04:31,409
TERRORISTS RESCUE PRISONER

610
01:04:31,827 --> 01:04:35,793
This headline was created, Eunice. At least
now they can't deny that he was arrested.

611
01:04:36,415 --> 01:04:38,515
Did they deny Rubens' arrest?

612
01:04:39,251 --> 01:04:40,951
They said has nothing to do with the army.

613
01:04:41,628 --> 01:04:43,976
Same thing happened to the
<i>Pasquim</i> guys, and they're fine.

614
01:04:44,256 --> 01:04:47,064
Exactly. Vanished for two months, then released.

615
01:04:48,594 --> 01:04:50,902
The international community is watching closely.

616
01:04:51,555 --> 01:04:54,247
What about a photo?
Of the family without the father?

617
01:04:55,058 --> 01:04:56,758
It's good, sure. Put it on the cover.

618
01:04:57,728 --> 01:04:59,661
- We can't do that.
- Why not?

619
01:04:59,872 --> 01:05:03,480
The newspaper is getting worse, guys.
Only what the military wants comes out.

620
01:05:03,692 --> 01:05:07,532
I'm thinking <i>The New York Times</i>,
<i>Le Monde</i>. How's your French?

621
01:05:08,196 --> 01:05:10,976
- I don't know what to say.
- Tell them about your arrest.

622
01:05:11,617 --> 01:05:13,617
- Eliana, too.
- Didn't she want to come today?

623
01:05:13,735 --> 01:05:19,151
- No, I send her to school. Is she fine?
- Yes. She's fine. A little scared.

624
01:05:22,961 --> 01:05:26,953
Calm. Rubens is a former congressman.
Nothing will happen to him. Okay?

625
01:05:27,291 --> 01:05:30,363
We need to keep showing
that we're watching them.

626
01:05:30,886 --> 01:05:32,406
We need to do more.

627
01:05:32,804 --> 01:05:36,644
Yeah, but without any concrete
evidence that he was arrested

628
01:05:37,309 --> 01:05:39,442
there's not much else we can do.

629
01:05:40,888 --> 01:05:42,568
- And his car?
- What?

630
01:05:43,190 --> 01:05:46,582
His car is parked in the army lot. 
I saw it yesterday.

631
01:05:57,788 --> 01:06:01,564
Mrs. Eunice, Mr. Lino arrived.
Should I put some coffee on?

632
01:06:02,376 --> 01:06:04,056
No, I'm already leaving.

633
01:06:04,378 --> 01:06:08,538
I'll pick the kids up at school.
Just take care of lunch, please.

634
01:06:09,433 --> 01:06:11,900
- What would you like me to make?
- Whatever there is.

635
01:06:21,937 --> 01:06:24,881
<i>...Shoot some tear gas
in the middle of the mob</i>

636
01:06:25,224 --> 01:06:27,524
<i>Ain't be no oxygen folks are gonna drop</i>

637
01:06:27,809 --> 01:06:29,809
<i>An incendiary grenade
a fire-thrower flashes</i>

638
01:06:30,737 --> 01:06:35,001
<i>That troublemaking mob
gonna trample on its ashes...</i>

639
01:06:41,206 --> 01:06:46,326
This is a change of clothes and medicine.
My husband is diabetic, he needs this.

640
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:49,253
I told you, there's no Rubens here.

641
01:06:49,756 --> 01:06:52,290
Can you tell us where he's been taken?

642
01:06:52,384 --> 01:06:55,116
For that, you've got to put in
a request to the federal police.

643
01:06:55,196 --> 01:06:58,196
Okay, thank you. Can we
have the receipt, please?

644
01:07:10,235 --> 01:07:12,235
Where do we make that request?

645
01:07:12,821 --> 01:07:16,381
No use, they'll just deny it. We'll
have to go through the courts.

646
01:07:17,034 --> 01:07:20,554
At least now, with this,
I can file the habeas corpus.

647
01:07:21,663 --> 01:07:24,196
I would like to read it. Can I keep it?

648
01:07:25,792 --> 01:07:28,192
It's worse than Greek. Are you sure?

649
01:07:29,129 --> 01:07:30,129
Yes.

650
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:37,902
I'll pick up the children at school,
then I'll stop to the office to return it.

651
01:07:39,222 --> 01:07:40,902
No need, I have a copy.

652
01:07:41,725 --> 01:07:44,625
If there's any news, I'll let you know. Okay?

653
01:07:51,193 --> 01:07:53,459
I didn't know Rubens was diabetic.

654
01:07:54,089 --> 01:07:55,089
He is not.

655
01:08:40,102 --> 01:08:43,562
I only found out who the letters
were for when I met your husband.

656
01:08:44,079 --> 01:08:46,012
So. Did you see Rubens there?

657
01:08:46,406 --> 01:08:48,273
We were put in the same car.

658
01:08:48,583 --> 01:08:51,317
- Where did they take you?
- I don't know.

659
01:08:52,004 --> 01:08:56,292
- They covered our heads with a...
- A hood. They did it to me, too.

660
01:08:59,094 --> 01:09:02,870
What's so hard about putting them
back where they came from?

661
01:09:02,881 --> 01:09:06,073
Martha, you've got to make
a statement to the police.

662
01:09:06,476 --> 01:09:08,310
But it was the policemen who arrested us.

663
01:09:08,378 --> 01:09:10,378
I know, but now they're saying they didn't.

664
01:09:12,482 --> 01:09:15,874
Look Eunice, I'm sorry.
I can't get involved in this.

665
01:09:16,403 --> 01:09:19,411
You're the only person who saw Rubens there.

666
01:09:20,290 --> 01:09:21,970
You've got to help me.

667
01:09:22,793 --> 01:09:24,793
If I don't prove that I was arrested...

668
01:09:30,625 --> 01:09:32,492
You've got to leave, please.

669
01:09:33,395 --> 01:09:35,075
My husband's in danger, Martha.

670
01:09:37,215 --> 01:09:39,149
Everyone's in danger, Eunice.

671
01:09:57,194 --> 01:10:00,030
- I can walk there, Mom.
- No, that's enough, Ana Lúcia.

672
01:10:00,155 --> 01:10:02,055
Why did Daddy's car come back, but he didn't?

673
01:10:02,357 --> 01:10:05,390
- 'Cause he's still on a trip, my love.
- Isn't this his bag?

674
01:10:05,394 --> 01:10:07,094
Leave that bag there, Marcelo.

675
01:10:07,321 --> 01:10:09,188
I've been missing ballet for two weeks now.

676
01:10:09,348 --> 01:10:10,815
- Cris said I can go with her.
- No.

677
01:10:10,832 --> 01:10:13,104
From now on, you come straight home from school.

678
01:10:13,219 --> 01:10:14,886
And nobody goes out on their own anymore.

679
01:10:15,763 --> 01:10:17,863
- What about Eliana's volleyball?
- I quit the team.

680
01:10:18,715 --> 01:10:19,715
Why?

681
01:10:20,467 --> 01:10:22,400
I don't feel like practicing.

682
01:10:23,303 --> 01:10:26,563
<i>...The search for the terrorists
who carried out the kidnapping...</i>

683
01:10:26,634 --> 01:10:28,634
Mom. They're talking about the ambassador.

684
01:10:29,184 --> 01:10:31,017
That's not for children's ears, honey.

685
01:11:08,139 --> 01:11:09,499
Zezé, get inside.

686
01:11:12,018 --> 01:11:14,118
Do you know where the key to this gate is?

687
01:11:14,729 --> 01:11:17,596
Does it have a key? Let me see if it's here.

688
01:11:28,394 --> 01:11:31,061
Pimpão, come here. Come here, you rascal.

689
01:11:34,808 --> 01:11:36,808
You rascal, you cannot leave.

690
01:11:36,852 --> 01:11:39,152
Don't. Huh.

691
01:11:43,883 --> 01:11:46,183
Zezé, what about that car with those men in it?

692
01:11:46,886 --> 01:11:49,420
It's been there for days, Mrs. Eunice.

693
01:11:49,764 --> 01:11:51,444
But do they do anything?

694
01:11:51,850 --> 01:11:54,858
They just sit there. Staring over here all day.

695
01:11:59,816 --> 01:12:03,144
Your apron's frayed. I told you
to buy a new one.

696
01:12:03,945 --> 01:12:07,581
The cash ran out. I had to use it to
buy groceries while you were away.

697
01:12:08,199 --> 01:12:09,966
There wasn't enough for a new one.

698
01:12:10,577 --> 01:12:15,185
Of course. I will go to the bank and
withdraw some money and replace it.

699
01:12:15,915 --> 01:12:16,915
Mrs. Eunice?

700
01:12:17,626 --> 01:12:19,259
Could you see about my pay, too?

701
01:12:19,445 --> 01:12:22,189
I know you've got an awful lot on your plate,

702
01:12:22,340 --> 01:12:24,240
but Mr. Paiva only paid me through December.

703
01:12:25,617 --> 01:12:29,189
- I'm sorry, Zezé. I'll sort it out.
- Thank you.

704
01:12:43,485 --> 01:12:45,165
- Thank you.
- Have a sit.

705
01:12:49,708 --> 01:12:52,108
Rubens can call to authorize the withdrawal.

706
01:12:52,660 --> 01:12:55,194
There's no telephone in the mountains.

707
01:12:55,789 --> 01:12:59,129
He had to stay longer to monitor the works.

708
01:12:59,793 --> 01:13:02,737
Is there really no way that
you can help me, Ritor?

709
01:13:03,296 --> 01:13:07,392
I understand, but without his
signature there's nothing I can do.

710
01:13:11,430 --> 01:13:13,350
How's Miriam doing?

711
01:13:14,808 --> 01:13:16,268
She's doing well.

712
01:13:16,893 --> 01:13:19,837
We need to arrange to see each other sometime.

713
01:13:19,997 --> 01:13:20,997
Let's arrange it, yes.

714
01:13:23,566 --> 01:13:28,458
Well, I brought some dollars and
pounds I had at home.

715
01:13:30,865 --> 01:13:33,265
Can you exchange them for me, Ritor?

716
01:13:33,993 --> 01:13:36,981
For sure, Eunice. Just a minute.
I'm gonna call someone to help you.

717
01:13:37,580 --> 01:13:39,260
- Thanks.
- Excuse me.

718
01:13:56,141 --> 01:13:57,141
Mom?

719
01:14:53,740 --> 01:14:54,740
- Hi.
- Hi.

720
01:14:57,619 --> 01:14:59,752
- Do you know where Mom is?
- No.

721
01:15:02,957 --> 01:15:03,957
Can I have a drag?

722
01:15:06,252 --> 01:15:07,372
- No.
- Please.

723
01:15:07,962 --> 01:15:08,962
No.

724
01:15:12,091 --> 01:15:13,091
You meddler.

725
01:15:17,555 --> 01:15:19,235
Gilda called again today.

726
01:15:19,474 --> 01:15:23,062
She managed to get Vera on the
waiting list for a flight next week.

727
01:15:23,962 --> 01:15:26,162
By the way, a letter from Veroca.

728
01:15:28,316 --> 01:15:31,580
I think it'd be better if she
stayed a while longer.

729
01:15:33,863 --> 01:15:36,196
Do you know how much the ticket is?

730
01:15:36,407 --> 01:15:41,079
I'll deal with Rubens later.
He'd better come back soon, to fix this mess.

731
01:15:45,759 --> 01:15:47,119
Ah, son of bitch.

732
01:15:51,807 --> 01:15:52,807
Ok.

733
01:15:59,264 --> 01:16:03,472
Everyone in my house doesn't see their friends.

734
01:16:06,896 --> 01:16:08,696
Why did they arrest Rubens?

735
01:16:09,274 --> 01:16:10,314
I don't know.

736
01:16:13,278 --> 01:16:16,044
The politicians have no chance.
They're chasing anyone.

737
01:16:20,743 --> 01:16:23,610
You're not going to do that to me, are you?

738
01:16:24,781 --> 01:16:27,581
I've been to that place. I saw it.

739
01:16:31,296 --> 01:16:34,396
I deserve to know what Rubens was doing.

740
01:16:36,593 --> 01:16:37,873
Don't you think?

741
01:16:39,846 --> 01:16:40,846
I do.

742
01:16:46,686 --> 01:16:51,053
Eunice, there's no way to just stand by.

743
01:16:53,568 --> 01:16:55,901
Especially us. We know many people.

744
01:16:57,447 --> 01:17:00,113
Who has the means to help those in need.

745
01:17:03,119 --> 01:17:07,619
So me, Rubens, Gaspa, Raul...

746
01:17:07,933 --> 01:17:13,881
One talks to the foreign press, another
one provides shelter to people on the run,

747
01:17:14,756 --> 01:17:17,656
and deliver letters to families without news.

748
01:17:19,010 --> 01:17:20,877
Everyone does what they can.

749
01:17:22,263 --> 01:17:26,231
But we're not involved in the armed struggle.
Much less Rubens.

750
01:17:29,646 --> 01:17:34,922
So you decided not to say a word
to me, to Dalal, to Dalva.

751
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:39,887
- To protect us.
- Of course.

752
01:17:48,748 --> 01:17:50,615
And do you think Rubens will be released?

753
01:17:51,376 --> 01:17:53,756
I do. He'll be back soon.

754
01:17:58,508 --> 01:18:01,644
Come have dinner in my house.
Dalal will be glad.

755
01:18:03,179 --> 01:18:06,443
I'm not really in the mood.
Too many kids to raise.

756
01:18:09,018 --> 01:18:10,018
Thank you.

757
01:18:15,233 --> 01:18:19,713
"These photos are on the subway.
One out front, one inside the train."

758
01:18:22,740 --> 01:18:26,516
"On the day I was going to
a party at the Arraes' house..."

759
01:18:26,694 --> 01:18:27,694
Pass it on, Marcelo.

760
01:18:28,204 --> 01:18:30,471
"You won't believe who was there."

761
01:18:31,582 --> 01:18:32,742
- Who, Mom?
- Guess who?

762
01:18:35,128 --> 01:18:36,128
Caetano?

763
01:18:37,296 --> 01:18:38,296
Gil.

764
01:18:38,506 --> 01:18:39,546
Gilberto Gil!

765
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:43,900
"He was wearing polka-dot velvet pants."

766
01:18:44,595 --> 01:18:48,563
"A Bob Marley song started playing,
and he asked me to dance."

767
01:18:49,642 --> 01:18:50,922
- No way.
- Such a liar.

768
01:18:51,161 --> 01:18:52,261
"It was amazing."

769
01:18:53,187 --> 01:19:00,803
"I miss the beach, the soufflé, and
you all. I miss everything, Vera."

770
01:19:03,489 --> 01:19:05,169
- Is that it?
- That's it.

771
01:19:05,950 --> 01:19:06,990
Can I see it?

772
01:19:13,833 --> 01:19:15,353
Everyone stay here.

773
01:19:16,919 --> 01:19:17,919
Marcelo!

774
01:19:44,906 --> 01:19:45,906
Pimpão!

775
01:19:55,583 --> 01:19:57,583
What are you looking at?

776
01:20:00,087 --> 01:20:01,447
What do you want?

777
01:20:03,508 --> 01:20:05,488
Where is my husband?!

778
01:20:05,718 --> 01:20:08,598
Go away! Get out of here! Go away!

779
01:20:09,430 --> 01:20:10,430
Get out!

780
01:20:38,476 --> 01:20:41,776
Zezé, get me a blanket. Please.

781
01:21:21,085 --> 01:21:26,553
"The Brazilian exiles were asking
about Dad, Mom, and Eliana."

782
01:21:27,341 --> 01:21:30,797
"I didn't know what to say.
I got this awful feeling."

783
01:21:31,387 --> 01:21:33,587
"Why don't you tell me anything?"

784
01:21:34,181 --> 01:21:38,405
"I found out about your arrests
from the papers. What's going on?"

785
01:21:39,121 --> 01:21:41,121
"I want to go home soon."

786
01:21:43,107 --> 01:21:45,374
Why didn't you read the rest, Mom?

787
01:21:45,526 --> 01:21:47,459
Give me that letter, sweetie.

788
01:21:48,112 --> 01:21:50,912
No. You skipped the part about Dad and me.

789
01:21:51,724 --> 01:21:54,524
Everyone's talking about us.
Vera doesn't know what's going on.

790
01:21:54,619 --> 01:21:57,811
- Give me that letter!
- You are lying to us!

791
01:21:59,916 --> 01:22:01,196
Go to your room.

792
01:22:29,095 --> 01:22:31,495
SUPERIOR MILITARY COURT
HABEAS CORPUS

793
01:22:34,894 --> 01:22:38,118
EUNICE PAIVA IS RELEASED AND LAWYER
ASKS SPECIAL PRISON FOR RUBENS PAIVA

794
01:23:02,783 --> 01:23:06,283
HE IS NOT AT THE
DESIGNATED LOCATION

795
01:24:01,746 --> 01:24:05,906
"I still can't describe the excruciating
hours I spent in prison,

796
01:24:06,542 --> 01:24:10,382
but I can guarantee you that
I was there with your husband."

797
01:24:12,006 --> 01:24:16,422
"Although I couldn't see him, I heard
him say: Rubens Beyrodt Paiva."

798
01:24:18,804 --> 01:24:23,796
"Before I was transferred, I heard
his voice one last time, asking for water."

799
01:24:27,229 --> 01:24:30,301
"I pray that the family will be reunited soon."

800
01:24:31,692 --> 01:24:35,852
"Give my best to my former students
Vera, Eliana, and Ana Lúcia."

801
01:24:51,579 --> 01:24:52,579
- Lino?
- <i>Who is it?</i>

802
01:24:53,072 --> 01:24:56,205
It's me, Lino. I'm sorry about I'm calling late.

803
01:24:58,344 --> 01:25:01,736
We have proof that Rubens was arrested.

804
01:25:07,269 --> 01:25:10,169
I think there's still time for a swim. Anyone?

805
01:25:10,648 --> 01:25:12,648
It's kind of late. I'm hungry.

806
01:25:12,691 --> 01:25:16,227
Zezé, no need to cook. We're going for ice cream.

807
01:25:17,279 --> 01:25:18,446
- Look at this.
- Any chocolate?

808
01:25:18,565 --> 01:25:20,165
- C'mon, Marcelo.
- I want French fries.

809
01:25:21,067 --> 01:25:22,534
 I want a strawberry sundae.

810
01:25:50,020 --> 01:25:51,020
Mom!

811
01:25:53,983 --> 01:25:54,983
Mom!

812
01:25:59,822 --> 01:26:02,555
"Died in combat", Médici said.
That's all.

813
01:26:12,334 --> 01:26:13,934
Can you publish that?

814
01:26:16,630 --> 01:26:17,630
No. Not yet.

815
01:26:18,783 --> 01:26:21,250
They won't admit it officially.

816
01:26:24,555 --> 01:26:28,663
We have to talk to Lino. He'll know what to do.

817
01:26:30,728 --> 01:26:33,261
There's nothing we can do now, Eunice.

818
01:26:33,856 --> 01:26:35,216
What do you mean?

819
01:26:36,942 --> 01:26:42,758
We have to force them to admit it publicly.
A subpoena, a court order.

820
01:26:43,365 --> 01:26:46,885
We think we need to continue
to ask for Rubens' release.

821
01:26:48,913 --> 01:26:51,446
As if we didn't know nothing about him.

822
01:26:51,832 --> 01:26:52,832
What?

823
01:26:54,877 --> 01:26:58,269
To have someone parked outside
my house all day long?

824
01:27:00,382 --> 01:27:02,916
So my phone will keep on being tapped?

825
01:27:10,309 --> 01:27:11,669
You're not alone.

826
01:27:20,962 --> 01:27:22,002
What about the body?

827
01:27:26,033 --> 01:27:27,900
I have nothing more to say.

828
01:27:29,578 --> 01:27:31,645
But what do you think they did?

829
01:27:36,502 --> 01:27:37,802
Say it.

830
01:27:38,003 --> 01:27:39,437
I've heard it all, Eunice.

831
01:27:40,047 --> 01:27:44,975
They bury in the forest, dropped into
the sea from a helicopter, mass graves.

832
01:27:47,054 --> 01:27:51,214
It's all rumors. There's no way
to know, 'cause nobody will talk.

833
01:27:51,409 --> 01:27:53,509
They're afraid of disappearing, too.

834
01:28:02,528 --> 01:28:04,928
Do you mind if I don't walk you out?

835
01:28:10,327 --> 01:28:14,591
I'm sorry, I wish I were
the bearer of better news.

836
01:28:15,207 --> 01:28:16,207
I know.

837
01:28:30,014 --> 01:28:31,214
Bye, bye, guys.

838
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:33,800
What were you talking about?

839
01:28:35,185 --> 01:28:37,477
I came to bring something for
your mother, that's all.

840
01:28:37,705 --> 01:28:39,405
Did you find out where my Dad is?

841
01:28:39,773 --> 01:28:42,107
Not yet. Take care, okay?

842
01:28:49,658 --> 01:28:50,698
So boring.

843
01:28:51,202 --> 01:28:53,435
You're boring, go play with your doll.

844
01:28:53,829 --> 01:28:55,629
- You stupid.
- Oh, Marcelo?

845
01:28:59,209 --> 01:29:00,209
Mom?

846
01:29:01,712 --> 01:29:02,712
What, sweetie?

847
01:29:03,339 --> 01:29:05,272
Mommy, Marcelo broke my doll.

848
01:29:05,549 --> 01:29:06,669
Sit down here.

849
01:29:16,101 --> 01:29:17,381
Were you crying?

850
01:29:19,354 --> 01:29:20,354
No.

851
01:29:24,485 --> 01:29:25,485
I fixed it.

852
01:29:28,372 --> 01:29:30,172
Shall we have some ice cream?

853
01:29:30,282 --> 01:29:33,015
- Yeah.
- Tell your siblings to get ready.

854
01:29:38,832 --> 01:29:39,832
- You?
- P.

855
01:29:44,213 --> 01:29:45,213
G.

856
01:29:53,097 --> 01:29:54,097
- S?
- No.

857
01:29:56,433 --> 01:29:58,433
- Say, Babiu.
- R?

858
01:31:36,033 --> 01:31:37,073
Are you sure?

859
01:31:41,163 --> 01:31:45,643
If you wait till the deed is in order,
we can get a much better price.

860
01:31:46,251 --> 01:31:50,095
I've got too much to do. I prefer it this way.

861
01:31:50,839 --> 01:31:52,739
I can loan you money, that's no trouble.

862
01:31:53,967 --> 01:31:58,383
That piece of land is a gem, and
you can still build the house there.

863
01:32:05,145 --> 01:32:08,665
Thanks for managing to sell it
without the proper papers

864
01:32:14,655 --> 01:32:15,655
I'm sorry.

865
01:32:20,410 --> 01:32:22,277
I wish I could've done more.

866
01:32:28,043 --> 01:32:29,723
It wasn't your fault.

867
01:32:31,046 --> 01:32:37,974
If you need anything, anything at all,
for you or for the kids, just tell me.

868
01:32:42,266 --> 01:32:43,266
Of course.

869
01:32:47,646 --> 01:32:50,179
- Is that a deposit?
- It's withdrawal.

870
01:33:06,206 --> 01:33:07,206
Thanks.

871
01:33:30,856 --> 01:33:32,056
- Hi Zezé.
- Hi.

872
01:33:33,108 --> 01:33:34,975
- Can I come in?
- Of course.

873
01:34:22,574 --> 01:34:23,574
Lass?

874
01:34:48,266 --> 01:34:51,800
I missed you. You've grown up.

875
01:34:53,355 --> 01:34:56,299
- Hi, honey. I missed you.
- Me, too. So much.

876
01:34:59,277 --> 01:35:01,411
Do you know that Pimpão has died?

877
01:35:01,780 --> 01:35:03,460
- What?
- The dog.

878
01:35:04,074 --> 01:35:05,274
Ah, poor puppy.

879
01:35:05,867 --> 01:35:09,515
- Can I keep the brooch?
- Of course. As many as you want.

880
01:35:09,855 --> 01:35:11,588
Where are Nalu and Eliana?

881
01:35:12,165 --> 01:35:14,713
They stayed home to wait for
the reporters from <i>Manchester</i>.

882
01:35:15,010 --> 01:35:17,182
What do the staff of this magazine want at home?

883
01:35:17,263 --> 01:35:20,363
They'll take a family photo
for the next edition, honey.

884
01:35:27,806 --> 01:35:30,539
Look, I'll work some magic. Pay attention.

885
01:35:33,103 --> 01:35:34,103
Mom.

886
01:35:35,439 --> 01:35:36,439
What, honey?

887
01:35:37,983 --> 01:35:39,783
I left your coat in London.

888
01:35:39,985 --> 01:35:43,377
Helena insisted on keeping it.
So, I left it with her.

889
01:35:44,573 --> 01:35:45,573
All right.

890
01:35:46,742 --> 01:35:48,722
- Really?
- Yeah.

891
01:35:50,495 --> 01:35:53,362
She'll need the coat more than me in London.

892
01:35:55,459 --> 01:35:57,139
Are you all right, Mom?

893
01:35:58,587 --> 01:36:00,320
I am, honey. I'm all right.

894
01:36:02,549 --> 01:36:03,829
Have you heard any news?

895
01:36:04,176 --> 01:36:05,176
Verinha.

896
01:36:07,171 --> 01:36:10,051
In London, it's in all the papers.
Hasn't this been published anywhere?

897
01:36:10,090 --> 01:36:11,090
Sweetie!

898
01:36:17,063 --> 01:36:19,071
Get be closer, get closer to each other, please.

899
01:36:19,775 --> 01:36:23,743
- Is everyone in the picture?
- Yes. Get closer to each other.

900
01:36:24,062 --> 01:36:25,062
Closer. Yeah.

901
01:36:25,806 --> 01:36:26,806
Ready?

902
01:36:27,407 --> 01:36:29,707
Let's go. Three, two, one…

903
01:36:31,036 --> 01:36:32,216
You don't have to smile.

904
01:36:32,829 --> 01:36:33,829
Why not?

905
01:36:34,414 --> 01:36:36,781
- The editor asked for it.
- For what?

906
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,333
He asked for a photo that's more...

907
01:36:40,378 --> 01:36:41,898
A photo less happy.

908
01:36:43,048 --> 01:36:44,568
He wants a sad one?

909
01:36:46,259 --> 01:36:49,391
No, he doesn't want a sad one.
He wants a photo without smiling.

910
01:36:49,971 --> 01:36:51,491
He wants a sad one.

911
01:36:52,182 --> 01:36:53,622
We going to smile.

912
01:36:55,101 --> 01:36:56,101
Smile.

913
01:36:56,454 --> 01:36:58,626
How about serious?
Can we get serious for a second?

914
01:36:59,890 --> 01:37:00,890
Smile.

915
01:37:01,066 --> 01:37:02,506
Look here, please.

916
01:37:03,151 --> 01:37:04,151
Smile!

917
01:37:04,611 --> 01:37:05,611
Three, two, one.

918
01:37:07,572 --> 01:37:08,572
Another one.

919
01:37:13,995 --> 01:37:15,729
<i>I really don't understand,</i>

920
01:37:17,082 --> 01:37:23,778
<i>how in a country with a allegedly
functioning justice system,</i>

921
01:37:24,381 --> 01:37:31,777
<i>someone break into my house, take my
husband, a family father, an engineer away.</i>

922
01:37:32,055 --> 01:37:35,255
Throw him in jail, and
then simply say "he's gone".

923
01:37:36,476 --> 01:37:39,209
<i>The inquiry was recently archived, right?</i>

924
01:37:41,231 --> 01:37:44,098
My lawyer has filed a request to reopen it.

925
01:37:46,319 --> 01:37:49,683
<i>It is unacceptable for the State
to act in this way,</i>

926
01:37:49,865 --> 01:37:52,165
<i>which is protected by a
system of false news</i>

927
01:37:52,867 --> 01:37:58,291
<i>designed to cover up the unlawful
acts committed by its own agents.</i>

928
01:38:02,436 --> 01:38:03,476
Is Zezé off today?

929
01:38:03,796 --> 01:38:05,796
She doesn't work here anymore.

930
01:38:06,214 --> 01:38:08,548
- Why?
- We can't afford to pay her.

931
01:38:09,718 --> 01:38:11,851
She works at Dalal's school now.

932
01:38:12,596 --> 01:38:14,276
Let me help you, then.

933
01:38:14,931 --> 01:38:18,003
No need. Tomorrow you can start on the rotation.

934
01:38:20,937 --> 01:38:23,204
Let me get the dishes for you today, Eliana.

935
01:38:23,857 --> 01:38:24,977
If you insist.

936
01:38:27,861 --> 01:38:28,861
How are you?

937
01:38:33,309 --> 01:38:36,509
I heard that they took you along with Mom.

938
01:38:37,412 --> 01:38:39,448
Eliana, what's going on?
Nobody tells me anything.

939
01:38:40,040 --> 01:38:42,240
We can't talk about that at home.

940
01:38:42,567 --> 01:38:45,959
I wish I could've made a
welcome-home soufflé, honey.

941
01:38:46,713 --> 01:38:47,713
No need.

942
01:38:48,173 --> 01:38:50,973
But there was no time. Shall we have lunch?

943
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:55,120
What are we going to do now
that Veroca is back? I'm in her room.

944
01:38:55,597 --> 01:38:56,637
I don't care.

945
01:38:56,973 --> 01:38:59,707
Eliana can stay with Marcelo and Babiu...

946
01:39:00,477 --> 01:39:02,877
- No way.
- But you're already there.

947
01:39:04,439 --> 01:39:07,831
There's stuff in another room,
I can't put it in mine.

948
01:39:07,984 --> 01:39:10,184
Hey, there's no point in arguing.

949
01:39:11,529 --> 01:39:14,041
Nobody's going to have a
room of their own anymore.

950
01:39:14,199 --> 01:39:15,239
- Why?
- What?

951
01:39:17,452 --> 01:39:19,452
We're going back to São Paulo.

952
01:39:20,121 --> 01:39:21,801
- What?
- Are you serious?

953
01:39:22,082 --> 01:39:23,082
Yes, I am.

954
01:39:24,250 --> 01:39:28,250
Grandma and Grandpa are there, and your cousins.

955
01:39:29,381 --> 01:39:32,047
And you can stay with them now and then.

956
01:39:32,717 --> 01:39:34,984
Because I'm going back to college.

957
01:39:35,220 --> 01:39:36,900
- What?
- I'm not going.

958
01:39:37,472 --> 01:39:39,152
- Eliana.
- I'm not going.

959
01:39:39,808 --> 01:39:41,488
What about the new house?

960
01:39:42,143 --> 01:39:43,943
It'll have to wait a little, sweetie.

961
01:39:44,562 --> 01:39:45,762
What about Dad?

962
01:39:47,983 --> 01:39:50,716
Your Dad is a long process to understand.

963
01:39:52,646 --> 01:39:55,870
I know it's hard to understand, but
you'll just have to be patient.

964
01:39:55,949 --> 01:39:58,997
And what if he comes back and
we're not here anymore, Mom?

965
01:39:59,536 --> 01:40:03,824
This house is already rented out.
It's going to become a restaurant.

966
01:40:05,875 --> 01:40:09,567
I want each of you to pack your
things, and on Friday,

967
01:40:10,171 --> 01:40:12,705
a moving truck will pull up out front.

968
01:40:13,299 --> 01:40:14,899
We're going back to São Paulo.

969
01:40:24,436 --> 01:40:26,169
Marcelo, hand me the salt.

970
01:41:54,951 --> 01:41:56,231
- Bye, Wooden leg.
- Bye, João.

971
01:41:58,655 --> 01:41:59,855
Bye, Luquinhas.

972
01:42:06,079 --> 01:42:08,979
- Keep this for me?
- You'll be back, rascal?

973
01:43:01,017 --> 01:43:05,584
How did you find it? Only Daddy knew.

974
01:43:07,265 --> 01:43:10,598
I know a lot of things, too.

975
01:43:11,603 --> 01:43:12,603
Let's go.

976
01:43:14,522 --> 01:43:16,322
Nalu, have you seen Eliana?

977
01:43:16,441 --> 01:43:17,441
No.

978
01:43:24,365 --> 01:43:25,365
Eliana?

979
01:43:29,204 --> 01:43:30,204
Eliana?

980
01:43:35,919 --> 01:43:36,919
Eliana!

981
01:43:44,677 --> 01:43:45,677
Eliana?

982
01:43:52,727 --> 01:43:53,727
Sweetie?

983
01:46:00,480 --> 01:46:02,800
25 YEARS LATER

984
01:47:39,036 --> 01:47:40,076
CLASS OF 1977

985
01:47:53,134 --> 01:47:54,494
You got in early.

986
01:47:55,236 --> 01:47:58,469
Hi, honey. I rescheduled my flight.

987
01:47:59,348 --> 01:48:00,348
That's good.

988
01:48:01,559 --> 01:48:04,567
I'm going to eat out with Daniel.
Do you want to come?

989
01:48:04,770 --> 01:48:08,226
I can't, Babiu. I'll just heat
something up. Thank you.

990
01:48:13,988 --> 01:48:15,268
Was that recent?

991
01:48:17,992 --> 01:48:20,192
I can't handle you in those little airplanes.

992
01:48:20,411 --> 01:48:21,411
By land, it's impossible.

993
01:48:22,747 --> 01:48:26,843
It takes three days and the area
is swarming with land grabbers.

994
01:48:27,460 --> 01:48:30,126
I thought you kicked them out last time.

995
01:48:30,713 --> 01:48:31,713
Me, too.

996
01:48:35,160 --> 01:48:36,960
When do you leave tomorrow?

997
01:48:37,578 --> 01:48:39,845
Manuela will pick me up at six-forty.

998
01:48:40,065 --> 01:48:42,032
I haven't even started preparing my speech.

999
01:48:42,600 --> 01:48:45,092
I'll wake up early so we can
have breakfast together.

1000
01:48:54,946 --> 01:49:00,002
The legal tools we have to try to prevent
the illegal occupation of these areas,

1001
01:49:00,868 --> 01:49:04,644
and the entire region affected by
the Trans-Amazonian highway, are:

1002
01:49:06,040 --> 01:49:11,020
First, file for the annulment of fraudulent
contracts by land grabbers,

1003
01:49:12,588 --> 01:49:15,255
which Manuela and I did for the Pataxós.

1004
01:49:16,592 --> 01:49:19,126
Second, enforce the 1988's Constitution,

1005
01:49:20,555 --> 01:49:25,419
it requires the State to guarantee
Indigenous peoples' rights to their land.

1006
01:49:26,227 --> 01:49:27,994
There's an urgent phone call for you.

1007
01:49:31,148 --> 01:49:32,148
Hello?

1008
01:49:53,838 --> 01:49:56,304
Couldn't you comb your hair, Marcelo?

1009
01:49:56,590 --> 01:49:58,457
I already put on a tie, Mom.

1010
01:50:02,138 --> 01:50:04,271
Do you have the documents there?

1011
01:50:04,390 --> 01:50:05,390
Yes.

1012
01:50:09,061 --> 01:50:10,861
- Good morning, Marlon.
- Excuse me.

1013
01:50:12,215 --> 01:50:15,415
Let me introduce you my children.
Marcelo and Beatriz.

1014
01:50:16,902 --> 01:50:18,702
And your little one? Is he fine?

1015
01:50:18,946 --> 01:50:20,946
- He's fine and back at school.
- That's great.

1016
01:50:21,057 --> 01:50:22,524
- Give Ivone my best.
- Sure.

1017
01:50:22,742 --> 01:50:24,608
And ma'am, congratulations.

1018
01:50:28,456 --> 01:50:29,656
C'mon, Marcelo.

1019
01:50:30,783 --> 01:50:32,463
- So is it really here?
- Yes, ma'am.

1020
01:50:33,377 --> 01:50:35,949
Cristiane, can you get Mrs. Eunice file, please?

1021
01:50:36,505 --> 01:50:38,185
- Yes, I can.
- Thank you.

1022
01:50:45,115 --> 01:50:48,131
Marcelo, sorry to bother, but when
your mom said you'd be coming in...

1023
01:50:48,768 --> 01:50:51,568
- Do you mind signing it?
- Yeah, of course.

1024
01:50:52,313 --> 01:50:54,513
- It's Carla, right?
- Yes, Carla.

1025
01:50:55,483 --> 01:50:57,749
- Did you like it?
- I cried a lot.

1026
01:50:57,886 --> 01:50:58,886
Really?

1027
01:50:59,904 --> 01:51:01,770
It was supposed to be funny.

1028
01:51:02,323 --> 01:51:04,723
The story of your accident moved me.

1029
01:51:05,527 --> 01:51:06,547
<i>HAPPY OLD YEAR</i>

1030
01:51:07,161 --> 01:51:09,028
Was there too much swearing?

1031
01:51:09,830 --> 01:51:10,830
- No?
- No.

1032
01:51:11,407 --> 01:51:15,311
See? She's the only one who gets on
my case about my language.

1033
01:51:26,038 --> 01:51:28,405
DEATH CERTIFICATE
RUBENS BEYRODT PAIVA

1034
01:51:40,861 --> 01:51:44,061
The press is here, Mrs. Eunice.
Can I let them up?

1035
01:51:45,324 --> 01:51:46,324
Yes.

1036
01:51:48,235 --> 01:51:53,003
It's weird to feel relief
with a death certificate.

1037
01:51:54,208 --> 01:51:57,536
How did you deal with the void
left by your husband?

1038
01:51:59,296 --> 01:52:03,436
Forced disappearances were one of
the regime's cruelest acts.

1039
01:52:05,136 --> 01:52:10,384
A person is killed, and this condemn all
the rest to eternal psychological torture.

1040
01:52:10,975 --> 01:52:14,239
Don't you think that after
the return of democracy,

1041
01:52:14,520 --> 01:52:18,360
the government have more
urgent issues than fixing the past?

1042
01:52:19,150 --> 01:52:23,242
No. I think it's necessary
to compensate the families.

1043
01:52:23,904 --> 01:52:25,708
And do the most important thing:

1044
01:52:26,323 --> 01:52:30,109
Clarify and judge all crimes
committed during the dictatorship.

1045
01:52:30,661 --> 01:52:34,437
Otherwise, they will continue to be
committed with impunity.

1046
01:52:37,585 --> 01:52:38,585
A picture!

1047
01:52:48,679 --> 01:52:49,979
Mom, not the cheap stuff, eh?

1048
01:52:52,016 --> 01:52:53,056
Is this good?

1049
01:52:53,434 --> 01:52:55,834
After the third round, who can notice it?

1050
01:52:59,815 --> 01:53:02,215
Now that this is finally over,
how about you get retirement?

1051
01:53:02,443 --> 01:53:04,343
- Retirement, Marcelo?
- Take a break.

1052
01:53:05,070 --> 01:53:07,570
Come visit me and Daniel
in Bern, take a little rest.

1053
01:53:08,449 --> 01:53:10,582
The rest I want is on the beach.

1054
01:53:10,993 --> 01:53:12,193
Then go for it.

1055
01:53:15,122 --> 01:53:16,402
Mom, you did it.

1056
01:53:27,752 --> 01:53:29,032
The rum is good.

1057
01:53:29,320 --> 01:53:31,000
- It's good.
- I told you.

1058
01:53:32,631 --> 01:53:34,998
- You're not opening that now.
- I'm already opening it.

1059
01:53:35,226 --> 01:53:39,518
- No, I still have to organize this mess.
- The paper asked for a photo of Dad.

1060
01:53:41,440 --> 01:53:44,640
I'll call Vera. The kids
must be back from school.

1061
01:53:44,652 --> 01:53:47,185
- Send my love.
- And my best to Jorge.

1062
01:53:52,952 --> 01:53:54,632
Look, Pimpão and Zezé.

1063
01:53:57,540 --> 01:53:59,540
Do you remember when that was?

1064
01:54:01,794 --> 01:54:03,794
Was the on... Nalu's birthday?

1065
01:54:05,464 --> 01:54:07,664
No, Dalva and Gaspa aren't in it.

1066
01:54:12,313 --> 01:54:13,993
You, me and Daddy.

1067
01:54:28,028 --> 01:54:29,708
When did you bury him?

1068
01:54:32,392 --> 01:54:33,752
What do you mean?

1069
01:54:37,746 --> 01:54:40,613
The day you realized he wasn't coming back?

1070
01:54:48,757 --> 01:54:52,021
I think it was when I saw Mom
donating his clothes.

1071
01:54:53,512 --> 01:54:55,512
About a year and a half later.

1072
01:54:56,348 --> 01:54:57,348
Really?

1073
01:55:01,562 --> 01:55:02,762
What about you?

1074
01:55:05,774 --> 01:55:07,908
I think it was when we left Rio.

1075
01:55:08,986 --> 01:55:09,986
That soon?

1076
01:55:12,281 --> 01:55:13,281
I think so.

1077
01:55:15,409 --> 01:55:17,209
Seeing the house all empty.

1078
01:55:25,586 --> 01:55:27,186
Vera sends her love.

1079
01:55:28,964 --> 01:55:30,864
Shall we take a photo for your sisters?

1080
01:55:31,508 --> 01:55:32,508
Yup.

1081
01:55:32,660 --> 01:55:33,780
- When was that?
- That?

1082
01:55:39,558 --> 01:55:41,625
I think it was Vera's birthday.

1083
01:55:48,042 --> 01:55:49,575
Did you teach her how to use the timer?

1084
01:55:49,985 --> 01:55:50,985
We're about to find out.

1085
01:55:57,534 --> 01:55:58,534
Smile.

1086
01:56:26,271 --> 01:56:27,951
Do you need help, Mom?

1087
01:56:30,275 --> 01:56:32,675
Check it, I think it's all in order.

1088
01:56:34,530 --> 01:56:37,074
As soon as I get the grant, I'll pay you back.

1089
01:56:37,408 --> 01:56:39,088
It's all set out here.

1090
01:56:40,661 --> 01:56:43,994
Let's go, I don't want to get stuck in traffic.

1091
01:56:45,082 --> 01:56:47,082
Mom, you really don't need to.

1092
01:56:48,644 --> 01:56:50,644
- Daniel's coming to pick me up.
- Oh, okay.

1093
01:57:04,518 --> 01:57:05,518
Call me when you get in?

1094
01:57:06,963 --> 01:57:07,963
I will.

1095
01:57:08,781 --> 01:57:10,681
Are you going to see the doctor?

1096
01:57:10,758 --> 01:57:12,058
No.

1097
01:57:15,779 --> 01:57:16,899
I'll miss you.

1098
01:57:20,325 --> 01:57:21,445
Me too, honey.

1099
01:57:24,455 --> 01:57:25,495
Go get ready.

Blow a kiss to Daddy.

1106
02:02:13,027 --> 02:02:14,547
You not. Joaquim.

1107
02:02:15,813 --> 02:02:18,981
Marcelo, I have the one from
<i>Manchester</i>, the one at the beach...

1108
02:02:19,958 --> 02:02:22,025
I think I have the ones from college.

1109
02:02:22,169 --> 02:02:24,702
And from Brasília, are there any left?

1110
02:02:24,963 --> 02:02:27,907
I don't think so. None survived.

1111
02:02:28,800 --> 02:02:33,448
- But there's the one with the pigeons.
- That one it's great for the cover.

1112
02:02:33,472 --> 02:02:34,772
That's up to the publisher.

1113
02:02:35,182 --> 02:02:37,954
I'll check what I have, scan and send it to you.

1114
02:02:38,310 --> 02:02:40,918
Eliana, put them on a pen drive for me, please.

1115
02:02:41,521 --> 02:02:42,521
The soufflé!

1116
02:02:45,692 --> 02:02:50,300
Guys, a total failure, it deflated.
Watch out, it's hot. No jokes, okay?

1117
02:02:56,036 --> 02:02:58,103
A sorry sight, eh, Mrs. Eunice?

1118
02:02:58,255 --> 02:03:00,887
- If Mrs. Eunice had left the recipe...
- It's Mom's fault now.

1119
02:03:01,500 --> 02:03:05,800
Are you satisfied? Babiu brought
your chocolate ice cream.

1120
02:03:08,140 --> 02:03:09,340
Chico? Do you want to, right?

1121
02:03:11,093 --> 02:03:13,026
- I want it.
- I want it, too.

1122
02:03:14,137 --> 02:03:15,137
Juca.

1123
02:03:22,062 --> 02:03:26,222
- ...In the holiday, we've talked about it.
- When is the holiday?

1124
02:04:28,378 --> 02:04:31,245
- Raquel, can you bring Mom? Please.
- Okay.

1125
02:04:37,596 --> 02:04:38,596
It's here.

1126
02:04:40,515 --> 02:04:42,115
You'll get me drunk.

1127
02:04:43,844 --> 02:04:44,844
Thank you.

1128
02:04:45,479 --> 02:04:48,807
Mom seems less irritated,
doesn't she? She's calmer.

1129
02:04:49,774 --> 02:04:53,241
Yeah. I think so. Joaquim does her good.

1130
02:04:54,138 --> 02:04:57,218
We've been together for four months,
but I don't know if we're dating.

1131
02:04:57,366 --> 02:04:59,566
Juca said she has the best kiss in the town.

1132
02:05:00,327 --> 02:05:02,393
- What, Juca?
- It's a criteria.

1133
02:05:05,540 --> 02:05:08,252
- What do you mean, man?
- Did you have a date with this girl?

1134
02:05:08,435 --> 02:05:10,502
No. I'm joking. It was just him.

1135
02:05:11,129 --> 02:05:12,862
Tell me how she spent this week.

1136
02:05:13,506 --> 02:05:17,922
There are days when she's fine.
There are days when she's out of mind.

1137
02:05:26,203 --> 02:05:31,807
<i>...Twenty-one years of military regime
in Brazil and the countless crimes</i>

1138

<i>committed against those who opposed it.</i>

1139
02:05:34,903 --> 02:05:38,103
<i>The Commission heard over
twelve hundred witnesses,</i>

1145
02:06:05,350 --> 02:06:07,817
<i>Such as Marambaia, in Rio de Janeiro.</i>

1146
02:06:08,645 --> 02:06:14,137
<i>Some of these victims became icons of
resistance against the military regime,</i>

1147
02:06:15,803 --> 02:06:19,707
<i>like the journalist Vladimir Herzog,
the student Stuart Angel</i>

1148
02:06:20,407 --> 02:06:22,340
<i>and Congressman Rubens Paiva.</i>

1149
02:06:27,581 --> 02:06:33,157

two hundred others, has never been found.</i>

1154
02:07:32,520 --> 02:07:33,960
Are you all right?

1155
02:07:36,066 --> 02:07:37,666
Joaquim, where are you?

1156
02:07:41,988 --> 02:07:43,721
Okay, get ready, everyone.

1157
02:07:44,908 --> 02:07:46,588

1158
02:07:49,037 --> 02:07:50,037
