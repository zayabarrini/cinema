1
00:11:01,889 --> 00:11:03,766
Are you Henry?

2
00:11:06,769 --> 00:11:08,437
Yes.

3
00:11:08,521 --> 00:11:10,397
A girl named Mary called on the pay phone.

4
00:11:10,481 --> 00:11:13,484
Said she's at her parents'
and you're invited to dinner.

5
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,573
Oh, yeah?

6
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:30,751
Thank you very much.

7
00:17:36,533 --> 00:17:38,285
You're late, Henry.

8
00:17:45,959 --> 00:17:48,837
I didn't know if you
wanted me to come or not.

9
00:17:48,921 --> 00:17:50,797
Where have you been?

10
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:59,306
You never come around anymore.

11
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:15,989
Dinner's almost ready.

12
00:18:32,005 --> 00:18:33,757
Come on in.

13
00:18:59,741 --> 00:19:01,535
Hello there.

14
00:19:02,953 --> 00:19:04,621
Hello.

15
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:09,710
I'm very pleased to meet you.

16
00:19:13,755 --> 00:19:15,716
Sit down.

17
00:19:43,326 --> 00:19:45,078
It's Henry, isn't it?

18
00:19:47,581 --> 00:19:49,082
Yes.

19
00:20:07,684 --> 00:20:10,187
Mary tells me you're a very nice fellow.

20
00:20:11,438 --> 00:20:13,190
What do you do?

21
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,610
Oh, I'm on vacation now.

22
00:20:18,945 --> 00:20:21,323
What did you do?

23
00:20:26,953 --> 00:20:29,372
Well, I-I work at Lapelle's factory.

24
00:20:30,415 --> 00:20:31,917
I'm...

25
00:20:33,168 --> 00:20:35,212
I'm a printer.

26
00:20:35,295 --> 00:20:37,798
Hen-Henry's very clever at printing.

27
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,179
Yes, he sounds very clever.

28
00:20:54,439 --> 00:20:56,358
I thought I heard a stranger.

29
00:20:57,526 --> 00:20:59,069
We've got chicken tonight.

30
00:20:59,152 --> 00:21:01,571
Strangest damn things. They're man-made.

31
00:21:01,655 --> 00:21:04,491
Little damn things... smaller than my fist.

32
00:21:04,574 --> 00:21:06,326
They're new!

33
00:21:07,911 --> 00:21:09,412
I'm Bill.

34
00:21:10,789 --> 00:21:13,875
Hello. I'm Henry.

35
00:21:13,959 --> 00:21:16,128
Henry's at Lapelle's factory.

36
00:21:16,211 --> 00:21:17,879
Oh, printing's your business, huh?

37
00:21:17,963 --> 00:21:20,006
Plumbing's mine. Thirty years.

38
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:22,008
I've seen this neighborhood
change from pastures...

39
00:21:22,092 --> 00:21:23,802
to the hellhole it is now.

40
00:21:23,885 --> 00:21:25,887
I put every damn pipe in this neighborhood.

41
00:21:25,971 --> 00:21:27,597
- Dad!
- Bill!

42
00:21:27,681 --> 00:21:29,474
People think pipes grow in their home.

43
00:21:29,558 --> 00:21:31,434
Well, they sure as hell don't.
Look at my knees!

44
00:21:33,186 --> 00:21:34,646
Look at my knees!

45
00:21:34,729 --> 00:21:36,231
Bill, please.

46
00:21:37,899 --> 00:21:39,401
- Are you hungry?
- Bill.

47
00:23:57,414 --> 00:23:59,582
The-The girls have heard this before...

48
00:23:59,666 --> 00:24:02,419
but 14 years ago...

49
00:24:02,502 --> 00:24:05,422
I had an operation on my arm here.

50
00:24:05,505 --> 00:24:07,841
Doctors said I wouldn't be able to use it.

51
00:24:07,924 --> 00:24:10,218
"Well, what the hell
do they know?" I said.

52
00:24:10,302 --> 00:24:13,179
And I rubbed it
for a half hour every day...

53
00:24:13,263 --> 00:24:16,099
and I got so as I could move it a little.

54
00:24:16,182 --> 00:24:19,102
And then I got so as
I could turn a faucet.

55
00:24:19,185 --> 00:24:23,189
And pretty soon, I had my arm back again.

56
00:24:23,273 --> 00:24:25,859
Now I can't feel a damn thing in it.

57
00:24:25,942 --> 00:24:27,444
All numb.

58
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:35,493
I-I... I-I'm afraid to cut it, you know?

59
00:24:36,578 --> 00:24:39,873
Mary usually does the carving, but...

60
00:24:39,956 --> 00:24:43,126
maybe tonight you'll do it, Henry.

61
00:24:44,753 --> 00:24:46,504
All right with you?

62
00:24:51,801 --> 00:24:53,303
Of course.

63
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:58,600
I'd be happy to.

64
00:25:05,523 --> 00:25:08,568
Do I just, uh...

65
00:25:08,651 --> 00:25:10,362
just cut them up like regular chickens?

66
00:25:10,445 --> 00:25:13,114
Sure, just cut 'em up
like regular chickens.

67
00:26:08,128 --> 00:26:10,588
She'll be all right in a minute.

68
00:26:11,631 --> 00:26:14,509
Excuse me.

69
00:26:49,711 --> 00:26:51,713
Well, Henry, what do you know?

70
00:26:57,343 --> 00:26:58,845
Oh, uh...

71
00:26:59,929 --> 00:27:02,265
I don't know much of anything.

72
00:27:38,551 --> 00:27:41,471
Henry, may I speak to you a minute?

73
00:27:42,972 --> 00:27:44,557
Over here.

74
00:28:29,769 --> 00:28:32,564
Did you and Mary have sexual intercourse?

75
00:28:35,108 --> 00:28:37,360
Uh... Why?

76
00:28:37,443 --> 00:28:39,112
Did you?

77
00:28:41,072 --> 00:28:42,991
Why are you asking me this question?

78
00:28:43,074 --> 00:28:45,451
I have a very good reason.

79
00:28:45,535 --> 00:28:48,037
And now I want you to tell me.

80
00:28:50,957 --> 00:28:53,710
Oh, I-I'm very...

81
00:28:53,793 --> 00:28:55,503
I love Mary.

82
00:28:55,587 --> 00:28:59,716
Henry, I asked you if you and Mary
had sexual intercourse.

83
00:29:01,134 --> 00:29:03,052
Well, I don't... I don't think
that's any of your business.

84
00:29:03,136 --> 00:29:04,637
Henry!

85
00:29:06,931 --> 00:29:08,433
I'm sorry.

86
00:29:10,643 --> 00:29:15,023
You're in very bad trouble
if you won't cooperate.

87
00:29:21,821 --> 00:29:23,656
Well, uh, I...

88
00:29:26,451 --> 00:29:27,869
Mary!

89
00:29:27,952 --> 00:29:29,829
Mother!

90
00:29:31,956 --> 00:29:33,458
Answer me!

91
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,127
I'm too nervous.

92
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:38,713
There's a baby. It's at the hospital.

93
00:29:38,796 --> 00:29:40,298
Mom!

94
00:29:40,381 --> 00:29:42,258
And you're the father.

95
00:29:42,342 --> 00:29:44,260
But that's impossible. It's only been...

96
00:29:44,344 --> 00:29:46,721
Mother,
they're still not sure it <i>is</i> a baby.

97
00:29:46,804 --> 00:29:49,432
It's premature, but there's a baby.

98
00:29:49,515 --> 00:29:51,976
After the two of you are married,
which should be very soon...

99
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:54,228
you can pick the baby up.

100
00:29:59,108 --> 00:30:00,985
Oh.

101
00:30:07,033 --> 00:30:08,785
Ahh.

102
00:30:08,868 --> 00:30:11,871
Mom, he's got a nosebleed.

103
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:14,624
Oh.

104
00:30:16,459 --> 00:30:18,044
I'll get ice.

105
00:30:23,466 --> 00:30:26,177
You don't mind, do you, Henry?

106
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:28,888
I-I mean about getting married.

107
00:30:30,556 --> 00:30:31,974
Oh, no.

108
00:30:43,695 --> 00:30:45,905
This dinner's getting mighty cold.

109
00:36:38,799 --> 00:36:40,551
Was there any mail?

110
00:36:44,597 --> 00:36:46,057
No.

111
00:39:57,289 --> 00:39:59,583
Shut up!

112
00:40:03,796 --> 00:40:05,881
Shut up!

113
00:41:14,074 --> 00:41:16,702
I can't stand it! I'm going home!

114
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:23,334
What are you talking about?

115
00:41:23,417 --> 00:41:27,129
I can't even sleep. I'm losing my mind.

116
00:41:27,212 --> 00:41:30,507
You're on vacation now.
You can take care of it for a night.

117
00:41:32,509 --> 00:41:34,720
Well, you'll come back tomorrow?

118
00:41:35,721 --> 00:41:38,724
All I need is a decent night's sleep!

119
00:41:48,025 --> 00:41:51,612
Why don't you just stay home?

120
00:41:52,905 --> 00:41:54,907
I'll do what I want to do.

121
00:41:56,784 --> 00:42:00,579
And you better take real good care
of things while I'm gone!

122
00:45:27,536 --> 00:45:29,871
Oh, you <i>are</i> sick.

123
00:53:30,268 --> 00:53:31,936
Move over.

124
00:54:08,098 --> 00:54:09,891
Move... Move over.

125
00:54:10,892 --> 00:54:12,560
Move over!

126
00:58:22,185 --> 00:58:24,645
I locked myself out of my apartment.

127
00:58:41,746 --> 00:58:43,748
And it's so late.

128
00:59:44,642 --> 00:59:46,561
Where's your wife?

129
00:59:57,822 --> 01:00:00,825
She must've gone back
to her parents' again.

130
01:00:05,621 --> 01:00:07,623
I'm not sure.

131
01:01:02,929 --> 01:01:05,681
Can I spend the night here?

132
01:03:27,573 --> 01:03:30,660
# In heaven #

133
01:03:30,743 --> 01:03:34,330
# Everything is fine #

134
01:03:34,413 --> 01:03:37,458

# Everything is fine #

136
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:44,006
# In heaven #

137
01:03:44,090 --> 01:03:48,052
# Everything is fine #

138
01:03:48,135 --> 01:03:53,182
# You've got your good things #

139
01:03:53,265 --> 01:03:57,728
# And I've got mine #

140
01:04:00,856 --> 01:04:03,984
# In heaven #

141
01:04:04,068 --> 01:04:07,405
# Everything is fine #

142
01:04:07,488 --> 01:04:10,700
# In heaven #

143
01:04:10,783 --> 01:04:14,203
# Everything is fine #

144
01:04:14,286 --> 01:04:17,373
# In heaven #

145
01:04:17,456 --> 01:04:21,502
# Everything is fine #

146
01:04:21,585 --> 01:04:26,340
# You've got your good things #

147
01:04:26,424 --> 01:04:30,594
# And you've got mine #

148
01:04:34,181 --> 01:04:36,767
# In heaven #

149
01:04:36,851 --> 01:04:40,354
# Everything #

150
01:04:40,438 --> 01:04:42,523
# Is #

151
01:04:42,606 --> 01:04:46,610
# Fine ##

152
01:09:49,121 --> 01:09:51,623
Okay, Paul!

153
01:09:59,256 --> 01:10:01,258
Hiya, sonny. What do you got there?

154
01:10:26,241 --> 01:10:27,951
Counter, Paul!

155
01:12:45,756 --> 01:12:47,257
It's okay.
