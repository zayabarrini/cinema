2
00:01:00,676 --> 00:01:03,776
It's gonna be tough.
The case wasn't easy.

3
00:01:26,041 --> 00:01:27,141
You are going to see him tomorrow?

4
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:30,260
Yes, dad.

5
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,960
Say hi for me and
ask him to visit here.

6
00:01:35,335 --> 00:01:38,135
Ah! He might not wanna visit.

7
00:01:39,258 --> 00:01:41,676
Thank you.

8
00:03:04,877 --> 00:03:07,877
Gift of 7th Room.

9
00:03:09,121 --> 00:03:11,244
The sun and The moon!

10
00:03:11,838 --> 00:03:14,597
My baby, the baby,
the fairy has visited.

11
00:03:15,643 --> 00:03:16,966
What do you see?

12
00:03:19,215 --> 00:03:23,298
You have wide set eyes...
you have many brothers!

13
00:03:24,031 --> 00:03:26,531
Ah..I am the only child..

14
00:03:29,878 --> 00:03:33,678
That's why people call you greedy.

15
00:03:34,037 --> 00:03:38,044
You took all the luck from brothers
and sisters you must be lonely, right?

16
00:03:38,174 --> 00:03:40,074
I'm not lonely..

17
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:51,836
The guy you are seeing now is a
bastard, he's gonna hit your back

18
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,670
break up, you should break up!

19
00:03:54,963 --> 00:03:56,763
I don't have a boyfriend..

20
00:03:59,551 --> 00:04:02,670
I told you not to get a
schedule in the morning, bad brother!

21
00:04:10,993 --> 00:04:12,242
Father, money

22
00:04:14,194 --> 00:04:18,606
I told you not to come in when I am in
the middle of work, listen to me! Please!

23
00:04:20,715 --> 00:04:21,815
You are Bong Seon.

24
00:04:24,574 --> 00:04:25,574
What is she saying?

25
00:04:26,274 --> 00:04:27,022
You know my sister?

26
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:29,333
Of course, so well.

27
00:04:30,001 --> 00:04:30,601
Shin Bong Seon.

28
00:04:34,601 --> 00:04:35,201
What are you?

29
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:36,401
Huh?

30
00:04:36,961 --> 00:04:37,847
In bible,

31
00:04:39,047 --> 00:04:40,757
Then when lust hath conceived,

32
00:04:40,957 --> 00:04:41,757
it bringeth forth sin: and sin,

33
00:04:42,786 --> 00:04:43,886
when it is finished,

34
00:04:44,688 --> 00:04:46,721
bringeth forth death.

35
00:04:47,121 --> 00:04:49,121
- Amen.
- Amen.

36
00:04:53,036 --> 00:04:55,008
Generous God, father.

37
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:57,887
Generous God, father.

38
00:05:02,487 --> 00:05:05,390
- Why he has come?
- Why he has come?

39
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:15,241
Yea Seung?

40
00:05:15,536 --> 00:05:17,195
- Yea Seung?
- Jesus?

41
00:05:25,653 --> 00:05:29,394
It feels awkward to sit here,
I used to sit there front of the judge.

42
00:05:29,671 --> 00:05:30,680
Do you also feel like that?

43
00:05:31,827 --> 00:05:34,362
I did nothing wrong, why am I so nervous?

44
00:05:34,762 --> 00:05:37,165
Forget about the dark pasts, brothers.

45
00:05:37,365 --> 00:05:39,171
- Amen.
- Hallelujah

46
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,200
oh, sshiii..t..t..

47
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:52,317
Sheriff

48
00:05:53,217 --> 00:05:54,764
all of you changed nothing

49
00:06:02,072 --> 00:06:02,972
from now on,

50
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:06,074
Judicial Research and
Training Institute 21th,

51
00:06:07,074 --> 00:06:10,297
let's get started with Pre-Jury System.

52
00:06:11,297 --> 00:06:12,873
Prosecutor, defend the case.

53
00:06:16,373 --> 00:06:20,089
The undertrial, Lee Dong Gu,
kidnapped young Choi Ji yoeng,

54
00:06:20,389 --> 00:06:22,143
molested, smashed her with stone and

55
00:06:22,361 --> 00:06:23,221
cruelly killed her.

56
00:06:24,321 --> 00:06:26,747
This is already proven by
National Forensic Service.

57
00:06:27,547 --> 00:06:28,400
This trial,

58
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:31,400
there is no necessity
continuing this trial in any parts.

59
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:34,101
I rest my case.

60
00:06:35,901 --> 00:06:37,225
Lawyer, defend.

61
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:45,883
The obvious proof that he's talking
about, confirmed testimonies.

62
00:06:46,983 --> 00:06:47,683
These are

63
00:06:48,846 --> 00:06:50,477
the mistake of this trial.

64
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:51,377
Your honor,

65
00:06:51,877 --> 00:06:54,201
- The lawyer is in contempt of Court..
- Mistake?

66
00:06:54,935 --> 00:06:55,435
Yes

67
00:06:56,535 --> 00:06:58,549
the prosecutor on this case

68
00:06:58,849 --> 00:07:00,699
isn't the guy who had
been assigned to this case.

69
00:07:01,899 --> 00:07:03,599
This case, unlike other cases,

70
00:07:04,289 --> 00:07:06,789
he must look back the
evidences and situations on the day

71
00:07:08,195 --> 00:07:11,056
but he's defending based on trumped-up
litigation records and fraudulent data

72
00:07:12,156 --> 00:07:14,172
which is made by
detectives long time ago.

73
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:19,410
Oh, so the lawyer,

74
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:21,594
are you the lawyer

75
00:07:21,894 --> 00:07:22,975
who had been assigned to this case?

76
00:07:25,575 --> 00:07:26,075
Are you?

77
00:07:29,809 --> 00:07:30,309
No

78
00:07:33,336 --> 00:07:33,836
I rest my case.

79
00:07:35,113 --> 00:07:35,613
But

80
00:07:38,303 --> 00:07:39,306
I am sure that

81
00:07:41,906 --> 00:07:43,740
I was there.

82
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,871
You were there?

83
00:07:49,671 --> 00:07:50,171
Yes

84
00:07:51,306 --> 00:07:52,078
there..

85
00:07:53,278 --> 00:07:54,107
I was there.

86
00:07:55,707 --> 00:07:56,837
Your honor,

87
00:07:57,937 --> 00:07:59,498
statement I will be speaking from now,

88
00:08:00,598 --> 00:08:01,098
is definitely

89
00:08:02,404 --> 00:08:03,197
true.

90
00:08:06,671 --> 00:08:09,685
Where I can meet you?

91
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:13,116
It couldn't be a fate.

92
00:08:13,683 --> 00:08:16,483
Miracle sailor moon

93
00:08:17,607 --> 00:08:19,407
not gonna forgive you

94
00:08:20,107 --> 00:08:21,414
as a name of justice

95
00:08:23,935 --> 00:08:24,635

Yeah.

100
00:08:32,667 --> 00:08:33,167
Six hundred..

101
00:08:33,667 --> 00:08:34,451
Ten dollors ..

102
00:08:34,951 --> 00:08:36,446
Wah~ we are rich.

103
00:08:36,793 --> 00:08:37,833
Yeah, we are.

104
00:08:40,932 --> 00:08:41,432

00:08:52,341 --> 00:08:52,861
What's this!?

111
00:08:53,716 --> 00:08:55,816

- Yes, sir.

337
00:26:24,919 --> 00:26:26,109
Is this son of a bitch crazy?

338
00:26:26,493 --> 00:26:28,429

339
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,640

340
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,678
Is this all you prepared?

341
00:26:46,362 --> 00:26:48,405
What the hell??

342
00:26:54,245 --> 00:26:55,457
Don't sit that way

In return..

00:27:01,384 --> 00:27:02,200
Anything you need?

347
00:27:04,761 --> 00:27:06,261
It's okay, tell me

348
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:07,770
do you smoke?

349
00:27:09,298 --> 00:27:09,998
Smoking is bad..

350
00:27:13,498 --> 00:27:15,961
He doesn't know my bro well.

351
00:27:16,877 --> 00:27:20,687
Once he speaks, he keeps. If ever he doesn't?
That's an asshole

352
00:27:22,898 --> 00:27:26,937
whatevery he makes a promise,
he keeps. That's gangster.

353
00:27:27,618 --> 00:27:28,520
This is the definition

354
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:32,140
you are lucky huh?

355
00:27:32,864 --> 00:27:34,343
What do you need?

356
00:27:36,918 --> 00:27:37,418
Yea Seong

359
00:27:41,416 --> 00:27:41,916

360
00:27:42,809 --> 00:27:44,509
Je..Jesus?

361
00:28:19,441 --> 00:28:21,383
- Have the kids also joined the church choir?
- Sir?

362
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:26,614
Ah... It's the first time.
Aren't they cute?

363
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:34,811
Chief! Cheif!

364
00:28:35,853 --> 00:28:38,718
Head of department wants to see you
you should go see him now

365
00:28:38,718 --> 00:28:42,141
Go now. What's all this for!?

366
00:28:58,315 --> 00:28:59,655
Hold on there, Yea Seong.

367
00:29:14,595 --> 00:29:17,140
Ah, not this way, wrong way.

368
00:29:26,075 --> 00:29:28,493
- Are you okay?
- Yes

369
00:29:33,837 --> 00:29:34,337
I'm super fine

370
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:36,539
go first, I can take care of this

371
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:19,648
you are Jesus?

372
00:30:24,787 --> 00:30:25,687
Dad!!

373
00:30:35,998 --> 00:30:38,930
Without saying, you left

374
00:30:39,741 --> 00:30:40,841

375
00:30:41,577 --> 00:30:45,964
- I'm sorry..I did terrible.
- You know how I've been looking for you!?

376
00:30:45,964 --> 00:30:49,576
Why? Where have you been!?
Sorry..

377
00:30:49,704 --> 00:30:52,302
- Without telling me..
- I'm sorry.

378
00:30:53,145 --> 00:30:56,269
Yea Seong got thin..
You are so light, Yea Seong

379
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:59,709
- shhh..shh..quite.
- Thank you, thank you..

380
00:31:00,218 --> 00:31:02,799
- What the hell, we are so much in trouble now.
- Thank you.

381
00:31:03,267 --> 00:31:05,193
This can't be happening..think about it.

382
00:31:05,505 --> 00:31:09,152
If ever we get caught..
No special pardon, nothing! Not forever!

383
00:31:09,394 --> 00:31:12,260
- All of us! 2 years more to stay!!

384
00:31:14,246 --> 00:31:15,743
Sir, look sir!

387
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:25,965
Bro, bro!

388
00:31:39,765 --> 00:31:40,265
Bro.

389
00:31:41,352 --> 00:31:42,519

- Look.

Look what?

- In our room..
- Your room?

393
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,454
What's in your room?

394
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:02,546

Why the hell are you crying for a bread?

399
00:32:23,723 --> 00:32:27,416
Here, eat, eat more

400

I'm having a tough day

401
00:32:38,275 --> 00:32:38,775
Yea Seong.

404
00:32:55,143 --> 00:32:57,543

412
00:33:16,059 --> 00:33:17,250
Why are you here?

413
00:33:17,398 --> 00:33:20,212
- Dad isn't a bad guy?
- Yeah.

414
00:33:20,639 --> 00:33:22,339
Dad isn't a bad guy.

415
00:33:23,773 --> 00:33:26,944
This is a school, school!
Not a bad place

416
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:28,423
eat, eat

417
00:33:29,593 --> 00:33:32,592
this isn't a school..
This..prison, prison.

418
00:33:34,253 --> 00:33:35,153
All of them, bad guys.

419
00:33:36,255 --> 00:33:38,755
Dad didn't do anything bad

420
00:33:44,511 --> 00:33:47,333
Shit... all shit... shit...

421
00:33:53,577 --> 00:33:56,295
- why are you already here?
- The minister blacked out

422
00:33:56,801 --> 00:33:58,212
high blood pressure!!

423
00:34:01,854 --> 00:34:02,973
Move move!

424
00:34:04,355 --> 00:34:06,179
You said 2 hours!?

425
00:34:06,613 --> 00:34:10,140
- It's been only half an hour.
- Half an hour now... 2hours..

426
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:13,628
Yeah..yeah, yeah
Things don't go as you wished

427
00:34:14,106 --> 00:34:16,092
- go, go see you later.
- Yeah, yeah

00:34:24,472 --> 00:34:26,070

- Hey!!

431
00:34:26,851 --> 00:34:27,777
Be quiet!!

432
00:34:29,316 --> 00:34:32,116
If you don't leave now,
you have to be a seeker forever.

433
00:34:32,488 --> 00:34:34,156
Keep being like this,
you won't see your father anymore.

434
00:34:34,446 --> 00:34:36,448
- Get it?
- Lower your voice!

435
00:34:38,363 --> 00:34:40,763
Dad, can't I stay here?

436
00:34:41,063 --> 00:34:42,931
Nobody knows

437
00:34:43,274 --> 00:34:46,129
- nobody knows, nobody..
- You need to go to school, school!

438
00:34:46,382 --> 00:34:49,650
Not good to cut schooling
visit on weekends

439
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:52,147
I thought this is a school.

440
00:34:52,361 --> 00:34:55,061
This isn't a school, it's a prison.

441
00:34:55,588 --> 00:34:58,401
Prison, bad guys.
That's why, go to school.

442
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,351
You want her to be

443
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:05,544
- Like him?
- What the hell

00:35:06,346 --> 00:35:07,884

445
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:13,201
Yea Seong, school

446
00:35:14,227 --> 00:35:16,099
- Visit again.
- What visit again? Crazy?

447
00:35:16,577 --> 00:35:17,579
Is this a playground!?

448
00:35:19,683 --> 00:35:22,066
Angel (1004) will bring you back here again
(1004 pronunciation is same as Angel)

449
00:35:23,763 --> 00:35:24,263

What the hell..

453
00:35:41,847 --> 00:35:43,518
Shit, why me . What the heck!!

454
00:36:05,868 --> 00:36:07,632
- Eat a lot.
- Yeah.

455
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:18,765
You can eat? Now with this situation?
Delicious? Dying to eat!?

456
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:19,580
Delicious..

457
00:36:20,986 --> 00:36:22,386
- Good?
- Yes.

458
00:36:23,477 --> 00:36:25,377
Yea Seong, eat beans, bean

459
00:36:25,685 --> 00:36:27,985
- vitamin, vitamin.
- I don't like beans

460
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,600
you need to eat, open your mouth

461
00:36:30,077 --> 00:36:32,558
Why are you here if you
don't like to eat beans?

462
00:36:32,584 --> 00:36:34,280
They are not giving
enough food..

463
00:36:34,281 --> 00:36:35,567
That little kid is eating all

464
00:36:38,375 --> 00:36:40,475
bro, what's your plan?

465
00:36:41,294 --> 00:36:45,454
That's what life is, easy to get things in
hard to get things out.

466
00:36:45,454 --> 00:36:48,054
Old man, stop bullshitting
really..

467
00:36:48,936 --> 00:36:49,922
Eat, eat

468
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,740
Bro... Let's just confess..

469
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:53,579
Huh? Let's confess.

470
00:36:54,479 --> 00:36:55,902
If we confess, what do we get?

471
00:37:04,018 --> 00:37:06,262
- You wanna poop?
- Yes

472
00:37:06,662 --> 00:37:07,925

473
00:37:09,952 --> 00:37:12,152
what the fuck, eating and pooping!?

474
00:37:18,707 --> 00:37:20,968
Close the door before you poop!!

475
00:37:28,023 --> 00:37:30,237
Bro, let's send her out 2 days later

476
00:37:30,817 --> 00:37:31,620
- What?
- A day after tomorrow.

477
00:37:32,106 --> 00:37:34,411
- When, 2 days later?
- On religion event day.

478
00:37:34,686 --> 00:37:36,265
He has come, He has come

479
00:37:36,266 --> 00:37:38,747
friend, you're so briliant

480
00:37:39,574 --> 00:37:43,747
- no doubt the swindler is a genius.
- I said I'm not a swindler.

481
00:37:45,010 --> 00:37:46,444
- It's a gift!
- Gather, gather!

482
00:37:48,532 --> 00:37:51,116
Get things ready
on religion event day, okay?

483
00:37:51,509 --> 00:37:54,179
- Okay.
- Look at these kids!

484
00:37:54,386 --> 00:37:56,786
All by chances, you guys
always gather and talk huh?

485
00:37:57,437 --> 00:37:59,806
Do not gather! Get it?

486
00:38:00,168 --> 00:38:01,168
Yeah

487
00:38:05,892 --> 00:38:08,612
Monica, I had a tough day

488
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:12,805
Good night, see you later,
have a dream of me.

489
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:17,610
Man Bum, let's sleep

490
00:38:26,099 --> 00:38:27,056
I'm sorry, dad

491
00:38:27,591 --> 00:38:30,265
I asked you to buy the sailor moon bag..

492
00:38:31,394 --> 00:38:34,353
Dad will buy you the sailor moon bag
when I get out of here..

493
00:38:34,674 --> 00:38:38,579
Dad, speak louder and clearly to the judge,

00:39:54,512 --> 00:39:57,803
- You are freaking me out now..

512
00:39:58,484 --> 00:40:02,221
- I wish to have a girl here.

520
00:40:19,374 --> 00:40:21,674
Lie down. Sleep

Hey Chun Ho, what

Why! Yea Seong! Why!?

528
00:40:42,948 --> 00:40:45,748
I thought she might be cold
so I dressed her up

529
00:40:46,243 --> 00:40:49,593
- you are driving me crazy.
- This is a violation of human rights, huh?

530
00:40:49,793 --> 00:40:51,593
By the way, what is she wearing?

531
00:40:52,036 --> 00:40:52,836
It's Sailor Moon

532
00:40:53,185 --> 00:40:54,785
what? Sailor Moon?

533
00:40:58,556 --> 00:41:00,056
I won't forgive you

534
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:02,927
with a name of Justice!
( Sailor Moon line )

535
00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:08,503
- That's what Judges usually say.
- Ah... It's Judge Moon.

536
00:41:08,503 --> 00:41:11,726
- Judge Moon.
- No... you don't know this song?

537
00:41:19,748 --> 00:41:22,249
Don't!

538
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:26,395
Hey, sit!

Shaveling...?

550

You don't even know
who is Buddah and Jesus!?

551
00:43:19,062 --> 00:43:20,127

554
00:43:35,611 --> 00:43:36,711
Can you choose the picture...?

555
00:43:38,323 --> 00:43:39,139
I don't think I am..

556
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:40,740
Please

557
00:43:42,551 --> 00:43:43,866
- Give them to me.

558
00:43:51,208 --> 00:43:54,747
- Is the minister fine?
- Yes, he's fine now

559
00:43:55,175 --> 00:43:56,275

562
00:44:13,791 --> 00:44:17,191
They even check the room even 12 times in
a day what if they open the door and check?!

563
00:44:17,417 --> 00:44:19,585
What are you gonna do then? Huh?
What will happen? Huh?

564
00:44:20,435 --> 00:44:21,435
You dick

565
00:44:21,835 --> 00:44:25,273
even if you needed to shave her hair
you should have sent her out!

566
00:44:25,389 --> 00:44:28,854
Not allowed... No
shaving Yea Seong's hair..

567
00:44:29,254 --> 00:44:32,014

Why are you guys still up?

571
00:44:53,052 --> 00:44:53,752
Have you eaten?

572
00:44:56,276 --> 00:44:57,329
Nothing is here.

573
00:45:42,125 --> 00:45:45,426
Nobody knew about this!?
You think it makes a sense?

574
00:45:45,427 --> 00:45:46,982
No, listen sir..

575
00:45:47,282 --> 00:45:50,404
I definitely heard a girl's voice..

576
00:45:51,631 --> 00:45:53,656
Put on emergency alert,
check all the rooms!

577
00:45:54,203 --> 00:45:57,163
- Yes, sir
- Yea... Yea... Yea Seong?

578
00:45:57,322 --> 00:45:59,022
I hid the kid in the furniture room.

579
00:45:59,716 --> 00:46:01,941
Are you fucking crazy!?
Get her out of here right now!

580
00:46:01,941 --> 00:46:03,491
- Sir...?
- Later, after the rain stops..

581
00:46:03,491 --> 00:46:04,875

583
00:46:10,492 --> 00:46:11,842
- A cold?
- Yeah..

584
00:46:11,842 --> 00:46:14,095
Are you fucking saying
a cold at this situation!?

585
00:46:14,687 --> 00:46:16,687
Yea Seong doesn't have
an umbrella..umbrella..

586
00:46:19,261 --> 00:46:21,661
You fucking murdered someone's daughter
but you still wanna see your daughter!?

587
00:46:23,875 --> 00:46:25,875
It's not true..

588
00:46:26,291 --> 00:46:27,602
9482 ( his number in the prison )

589
00:46:29,343 --> 00:46:31,443
haven't killed..

590
00:46:36,978 --> 00:46:37,778
Bro..

591
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:42,040
As I see so far I think if we
say nothing, we won't be in any trouble

592
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:43,340
you son of..shut up

593
00:46:43,911 --> 00:46:44,411
okay..

594
00:46:44,711 --> 00:46:46,217
If we reveal about this,

595
00:46:46,517 --> 00:46:49,117
few of prison officers will be fired
what will they do to us, huh?

596
00:46:49,603 --> 00:46:51,786
- We got nothing to lose.
- Yeah.

597
00:46:52,225 --> 00:46:55,625
Yeah, those guards are also same as we are

598
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:56,839
sleeping with the enemy!

599
00:46:57,039 --> 00:46:57,868
Cooperation charge

600
00:46:58,827 --> 00:47:00,827
educated one is different from us

601
00:47:01,734 --> 00:47:03,134
cooperation charge ~

602
00:47:03,483 --> 00:47:05,599
I feel so relieved, amazing.

603
00:47:06,982 --> 00:47:09,782
Yea Seong's father must have been
sent to solitary confinement, right?

604
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:13,594
Put them down

605
00:47:13,994 --> 00:47:15,964

Fire, there's fire, fire!

613
00:48:44,114 --> 00:48:48,234
Chief! There's a guy.

614
00:48:48,234 --> 00:48:49,182
He set this!!

615
00:48:49,182 --> 00:48:51,731
The next room, she can visit

616
00:48:52,348 --> 00:48:53,868
You guys stopped him from visiting me!

617
00:48:54,425 --> 00:48:55,988

8038! we didn't let the girl in!

619
00:48:59,424 --> 00:49:00,376
You can't do this!

620
00:49:00,724 --> 00:49:01,860
Is my name 8038!?

621
00:49:02,593 --> 00:49:04,993
Call my name!! name!

622

Okay, I will call you with a name

623
00:49:10,410 --> 00:49:13,941
- Put..put it down.

625
00:49:22,545 --> 00:49:28,527
Hey, Baldy! You don't wanna go

626
00:49:28,528 --> 00:49:30,248
Why the fuck would I put this down for you?

627
00:49:31,538 --> 00:49:34,492
- Open the cells, get them to the yard.
- Yes, sir.

628
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:54,686
- You!
- Alright..put it down.

629
00:49:54,806 --> 00:49:58,932
- You stopped my father from visiting me!
- I will call your father so put it down!

630
00:50:03,116 --> 00:50:07,393
- I miss my father.
- Put it down, I said I will call your father.

631
00:50:10,398 --> 00:50:12,824
Really? Okay...
I'm putting it down.

632
00:50:13,808 --> 00:50:15,946
Thank you, chief. Thank you

633
00:50:16,709 --> 00:50:19,049

Fuck you

634
00:50:19,454 --> 00:50:21,702
I'm an orphan! You son of a bitches!

635
00:50:52,693 --> 00:50:55,335
Get out now!
You wanna die there!?

636
00:50:55,336 --> 00:50:57,925
Stay away from me unless you wanna die too!

637
00:51:04,557 --> 00:51:08,142
What the fuck, how...
Don't come closer! Don't!!

638
00:51:11,218 --> 00:51:13,903
He's dying..dying..
He's dying there.

639
00:51:14,337 --> 00:51:17,424
- Dying..
- Not my business! Shit!

640
00:51:59,839 --> 00:52:02,039
- What happened?
- What do you mean what happened?

641
00:52:02,636 --> 00:52:03,636
What a relief.

642
00:52:05,504 --> 00:52:06,904
If there wasn't a stammerer,

643
00:52:07,550 --> 00:52:09,405
you are at the funeral now.

644
00:52:11,606 --> 00:52:12,106
Who?

645
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:22,460
This dude has carried you on his back.
He must have inhaled a lot of gases

646
00:52:23,636 --> 00:52:25,636
with tears and nasal discharge.

647
00:52:26,088 --> 00:52:28,988
He said " help him, our chief
help him please".

648
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:34,040
By the way, is this guy really a kidnapper?
Is he?

649
00:52:35,483 --> 00:52:36,883
He said he didn't kidnap...

650
00:52:55,678 --> 00:52:56,678
hello

651
00:53:03,608 --> 00:53:04,908
take care.

She doesn't eat anything at all.

711
00:57:55,791 --> 00:57:57,391
I knew this will happen ..

712
00:57:59,406 --> 00:58:01,906
We can't support and take her anymore..

713
00:58:04,011 --> 00:58:07,630
Provinces are much better... government
supports provinces more than here..

714
00:58:17,319 --> 00:58:18,319
Mr..

Can't you just arrest me too?

00:58:34,193 --> 00:58:34,693

718
00:58:45,909 --> 00:58:48,407
This isn't right, chief

720
00:58:51,474 --> 00:58:54,127
Hey, you idiot

721
00:58:54,319 --> 00:58:56,219
I will be a farmer.

722
00:58:57,884 --> 00:58:58,584

00:58:59,817 --> 00:59:01,717

724
00:59:02,848 --> 00:59:03,648

732
00:59:54,607 --> 00:59:57,670
Is it a special day? Why are you
offering rice cake? Unusual..

733
00:59:57,897 --> 01:00:01,287
Before Chief leaves for a traning session,
he specially left it for room no.7.

734
01:00:02,923 --> 01:00:03,523

744
01:01:07,585 --> 01:01:08,129

01:01:36,277 --> 01:01:36,777

754
01:01:51,681 --> 01:01:53,581

755
01:01:55,981 --> 01:01:56,821
Why did you kill her?

756
01:02:03,879 --> 01:02:05,679
You read it for me please

757
01:02:05,991 --> 01:02:08,791

758
01:02:09,493 --> 01:02:13,183

759
01:02:13,436 --> 01:02:16,750

760
01:02:16,750 --> 01:02:18,868

761
01:02:19,422 --> 01:02:20,222
now..

762
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:23,660
Let me see..

763
01:02:24,866 --> 01:02:26,934
There's a butterfly
you see? Right?

764
01:02:28,138 --> 01:02:31,129
A butterfly was on my thigh
it was drawn on... before

765
01:02:34,380 --> 01:02:36,080
oh there's only one butterfly, right?

766
01:02:37,216 --> 01:02:38,232
Maverick, you know?

767
01:02:39,353 --> 01:02:41,953
The butterfly met a rat
so..bring it on

768
01:02:42,511 --> 01:02:43,511
brother, brother, brother...

770
01:02:48,158 --> 01:02:49,658

What's wrong with you ..

771
01:02:51,109 --> 01:02:54,709
Brother, there's no illiterate guy
in this generation, not in 2013.

772
01:02:55,881 --> 01:02:58,042
- There is no man who can't read.
- I know, go ahead!

773
01:02:59,246 --> 01:03:03,887
Even a dog, monkey, dolphin, orangutan and chimpanzee
can graduate from highschool after 3 months studying

774
01:03:04,248 --> 01:03:05,408
I know, who said they can't!?

775
01:03:08,190 --> 01:03:10,090
Illiterate? Is that a human?

776
01:03:11,190 --> 01:03:13,173
Do you know how many
percentage is illiterate!?

777
01:03:13,761 --> 01:03:15,661
There is no illiterate one
here in the room, brother.

778
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,100
When you say something,
know the facts first.

779
01:03:18,348 --> 01:03:20,545
- Okay, okay
- Where the hell is a guy who doesn't know how to read!?

780
01:03:20,545 --> 01:03:21,618
That's fucking idiot!

781
01:03:22,509 --> 01:03:24,663
I see! Don't be upset, it's your turn now.

782
01:03:27,343 --> 01:03:29,549
- What the...
- Who the hell doesn't know how to read!?

783
01:03:30,706 --> 01:03:35,556
- On cold winter, there's butterfly from the egg...
- Brother...

784
01:03:36,033 --> 01:03:36,781
I want it too.

785
01:03:38,333 --> 01:03:38,833
Want what?

786
01:03:40,449 --> 01:03:43,288
Listen, Yea Seong also got in here

787
01:03:44,127 --> 01:03:45,527
I also my want my baby here!!

788
01:03:47,300 --> 01:03:48,100
What the hell..

789
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:51,667
Is it the care of a day nursery here!?
You dumb

790
01:03:53,637 --> 01:03:55,657
you can't get out, the baby will be born

791
01:03:56,672 --> 01:03:58,472
you must be going crazy

792
01:03:59,021 --> 01:04:00,081
Look, look at this.

793
01:04:00,081 --> 01:04:02,581
21 weeks, after 21 weeks, she will be out

794
01:04:03,015 --> 01:04:05,315
Look, read this you son
of a bitch, I won't read.

795
01:04:10,044 --> 01:04:13,030
You don't know how to read, how to
deal with a baby you know nothing.

796
01:04:13,340 --> 01:04:14,842
You fucking assholes.

797
01:04:17,267 --> 01:04:19,898
- Why...
- You idi...

798
01:04:21,147 --> 01:04:22,031
you really wanna her here?

799
01:04:27,503 --> 01:04:28,203
Then..

800
01:04:29,405 --> 01:04:30,205
You also get a death sentence too

801
01:04:42,694 --> 01:04:45,645
of course, I do remember
don't even mention about the day

802
01:04:46,397 --> 01:04:47,997
emergency alert from the dawn.

803
01:04:48,574 --> 01:04:51,454
It wasn't just a daughter of police,
It was the daughter of Commissioner!

804
01:04:51,665 --> 01:04:55,669
Secretary of Interior even
ordered to close the case in a week!

805
01:04:56,162 --> 01:04:57,462
- Detective Park
- Brother!

806
01:04:58,462 --> 01:05:00,206
Can I see the case of Lee Yong Goo?

807
01:05:04,394 --> 01:05:05,294
No, brother..

808
01:05:07,083 --> 01:05:07,583
Let me see

809
01:05:09,583 --> 01:05:12,150
I am a policeman of the public, brother!

810
01:05:21,989 --> 01:05:24,098
Are you sure this is the
statement by Lee Yong Goo!?

811
01:05:25,344 --> 01:05:27,144
I don't know, I'm not the guy who got it

812
01:05:29,475 --> 01:05:30,475
I need a copy of this

813
01:05:31,762 --> 01:05:34,262
brother, I can't let you copy

814
01:05:36,032 --> 01:05:39,123
- then I will just take this!?
- Brother, please!

815
01:05:40,008 --> 01:05:40,808
I said no..

816
01:05:41,533 --> 01:05:42,894
You wanna see me getting fired!?

817
01:05:46,133 --> 01:05:48,633
You are doing this again really!?

818
01:05:50,307 --> 01:05:53,028
Because of that son of a bitches,
Jin Wook got kidnapped and murdered! Huh!?

819
01:05:56,558 --> 01:05:58,958
Wow! It's much smaller
than my telephone in my house!

820
01:05:59,693 --> 01:06:01,867
- Is that real?
- Of course, It's fake.

821
01:06:02,035 --> 01:06:02,535
It's real one!

822
01:06:03,535 --> 01:06:04,730
Can I touch?

823
01:06:06,230 --> 01:06:07,558
Don't press "send"

824
01:06:11,947 --> 01:06:12,947
what is "send"?

825
01:06:25,696 --> 01:06:28,032
Mr.!! Thank you Young Woon!

826
01:06:45,290 --> 01:06:49,247
Yeah, that's right
you can do it better!

827
01:06:49,938 --> 01:06:52,205
- Next, Apple.
- Apple.

828
01:06:53,502 --> 01:06:54,396
- Apple.
- Apple.

829
01:06:56,665 --> 01:06:59,758
- He's good after all the practices.
- Good boy

830
01:07:00,676 --> 01:07:02,153
"ple"

831
01:07:04,185 --> 01:07:04,729
put a line down

832
01:07:06,290 --> 01:07:06,790
down

833
01:07:07,735 --> 01:07:08,994
down down there.

834
01:07:12,845 --> 01:07:17,452
This one is "lion", LION!

835
01:07:17,719 --> 01:07:18,219
Idiot

836
01:07:18,695 --> 01:07:19,495
apple

837
01:07:20,066 --> 01:07:20,866
"p" in "ple"!

838
01:07:21,165 --> 01:07:22,652
You don't even know letter P!?

839
01:07:23,816 --> 01:07:26,637
How many days are you doing this huh?
You fucking idiot

840
01:07:26,637 --> 01:07:27,137
letter P.

841
01:07:27,830 --> 01:07:28,330
P!!!!!

842
01:07:28,690 --> 01:07:29,690
Don't you pee? Pee ~

843
01:07:29,790 --> 01:07:31,582
- even he knows it.
- You don't pee? Pee?

844
01:07:31,853 --> 01:07:32,737
He doesn't even pee, huh!?

845
01:07:45,673 --> 01:07:48,873
- Yes!!
- Correct!

846
01:07:50,043 --> 01:07:50,843
You son of a bitch

847
01:07:56,794 --> 01:07:58,694
you can even study highschool stuff now.

848
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:01,700
If I just knew how to read,
I would be a prosecutor.

849
01:08:04,948 --> 01:08:07,140
Don't you think they took the letter huh?

850
01:08:09,352 --> 01:08:10,352
He's right

851
01:08:10,752 --> 01:08:15,412
Women can't move easily when they are pregnant.
You think she has enough energy to write a letter?

852
01:08:16,186 --> 01:08:16,986
Don't worry, It's fine

853
01:08:24,577 --> 01:08:25,277
look

854
01:08:32,645 --> 01:08:33,145
what the hell

855
01:08:33,947 --> 01:08:34,447
what the!!

856
01:08:37,565 --> 01:08:38,886
Where the heck did you get this!?

857
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:40,420
I borrowed it from Young Woon.

858
01:08:40,861 --> 01:08:41,861
Isn't It a toy!?

859
01:08:43,599 --> 01:08:45,770
This isn't allowed here..but..

860
01:08:47,511 --> 01:08:49,511
- Try.
- Yes.

861
01:08:54,159 --> 01:08:56,436
- Put the antenna out.
- Antenna, antenna

862
01:08:57,703 --> 01:08:59,203
I think th..t..h..thi..this isn't working.

863
01:09:03,801 --> 01:09:05,401
It's not working.

864
01:09:05,801 --> 01:09:07,750
- It's weird.
- Why?

865
01:09:08,659 --> 01:09:12,348
- YeaSeong, is this...
- Close to the window, window!

866
01:09:15,078 --> 01:09:17,178
- I got a signal, signal!!
- Hello?

867
01:09:17,703 --> 01:09:20,174
He..hello?
Who the hell are you?

868
01:09:20,639 --> 01:09:22,537
- Hell...
- Did you call me to receive the fax!?

869
01:09:23,573 --> 01:09:25,668
It works, It's working
I am on the phone.

870
01:09:26,103 --> 01:09:27,426
- BongSuk.
- Honey...

871
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:32,360
I gave a birth myself

872
01:09:32,545 --> 01:09:34,045
stop crying, talk

873
01:09:36,162 --> 01:09:38,062
what the hell, It's not working again.

874
01:09:39,299 --> 01:09:41,646
This makes me crazy. Fuck!

875
01:09:41,646 --> 01:09:44,669
Work, work, work.
Why the hell isn't it working?

876
01:09:47,431 --> 01:09:48,231
Hey hey hey hey!

877
01:09:51,970 --> 01:09:52,670
Go away!

878
01:10:01,291 --> 01:10:02,212
I got a signal! Signal!

879
01:10:02,684 --> 01:10:04,415
- You hear me, honey?
- Signal, signal!

880
01:10:04,416 --> 01:10:06,315
Baby's crying, baby!!

881
01:10:06,316 --> 01:10:08,337
- Ask the baby to speak to dad.
- Dad?

882
01:10:09,403 --> 01:10:11,303
Baby, baby!

883
01:10:12,107 --> 01:10:12,607
It's me, dad

884
01:10:15,368 --> 01:10:16,248
she's smiling, smile!!

885
01:10:18,645 --> 01:10:22,805
- He's got all fingers and toes?
- Of course, he's a sleepy-head just like you.

886
01:10:22,806 --> 01:10:26,559
- Yeah? Is it he or she?
- Daughter!

887
01:10:27,807 --> 01:10:30,307
Brother, It's a daughter

888
01:10:31,801 --> 01:10:32,501
daughter, she..

889
01:10:35,221 --> 01:10:36,021
He's screwed up

890
01:10:36,140 --> 01:10:39,616
- are you happy honey?
- Yes

891
01:10:39,918 --> 01:10:42,279
where are you?
I'm so tired alone

892
01:10:42,472 --> 01:10:44,824
- listen, I can't talk to you longer.
- What?

893
01:10:44,824 --> 01:10:48,203
- Battery is weak now.
- Honey, what about her name!?

894
01:10:48,572 --> 01:10:50,407
- Name for her.
- Name, name, name...

895
01:10:50,607 --> 01:10:52,018
Name, name, name...

896
01:10:52,335 --> 01:10:54,572
You got Bong in your name,
Seon in "fairy" ( Korean ).

897
01:10:54,572 --> 01:10:58,046
Ah!! Bong Seon. Shin Bong Seon.

898
01:10:58,343 --> 01:11:01,350
Wrong, It's too wrong
what the heck is Shin Bong Seon.

899
01:11:01,731 --> 01:11:04,352
- I love you honey.
- I love you too, Seon yeo!

900
01:11:08,208 --> 01:11:09,290
Done? It's off

901
01:11:12,451 --> 01:11:13,055
thank you

902
01:11:14,514 --> 01:11:15,367
hey, stop crying, stop

903
01:11:15,801 --> 01:11:18,001
by the way, Young Woon?
Is he your boyfriend?

904
01:11:18,415 --> 01:11:20,542
- Is he handsome?
- Yes, he's reliable.

905
01:11:23,534 --> 01:11:24,980
You are also reliable to me.

906
01:11:29,098 --> 01:11:31,241
You are most reliable to me

907
01:11:31,748 --> 01:11:34,802
look at this
you can't see my hand!

908
01:11:39,356 --> 01:11:40,230
That's good.

909
01:11:40,930 --> 01:11:41,430
Mr. Lee Yong Goo

910
01:11:42,230 --> 01:11:44,633
- hello.
- You got a schedule for the next trial

911
01:11:46,636 --> 01:11:49,423
this one..
This trial is verdict

912
01:11:49,683 --> 01:11:52,434
- you, be prepared.
- Yeah, prepared

913
01:11:55,689 --> 01:11:57,101
hey Yong Goo.

914
01:11:57,411 --> 01:11:58,898
It's not time for you to jog now

915
01:11:59,602 --> 01:12:00,733
hey Lee Yong Goo

916
01:12:01,182 --> 01:12:02,459
that fucking crazy man

917
01:12:39,067 --> 01:12:42,463
fell down? Then what?
She just died like that!?

918
01:12:43,715 --> 01:12:46,615
Even I think it over and over,
it doesn't make sense.

919
01:12:47,791 --> 01:12:49,173
- Lee Yong Goo.
- Yeah.

920
01:12:49,173 --> 01:12:51,173
How was she lying down?

921
01:12:53,234 --> 01:12:55,812
She was just lying down
I was scared

922
01:12:57,859 --> 01:12:58,359
bro

923
01:12:59,259 --> 01:13:01,682
I think there's another guy
who tried to steal

924
01:13:02,127 --> 01:13:04,631
- the bag and killed her.
- Bullshit!

925
01:13:09,407 --> 01:13:12,584
- When you got there, she was lying down like this?
- Yeah.

926
01:13:12,826 --> 01:13:14,461
- Without any reason?
- Yeah.

927
01:13:21,213 --> 01:13:24,514
- Do you feel dying?
- Shit, my arm arm arm

928
01:13:24,716 --> 01:13:26,510
- it fucking hurts.
- Right?

929
01:13:27,166 --> 01:13:27,666
Arm

930
01:13:28,300 --> 01:13:31,565
usually when a person falls down,
they use their arm to support the body

931
01:13:32,597 --> 01:13:35,340
but in her, her backhead got broken

932
01:13:36,268 --> 01:13:38,202
why backhead!?

933
01:13:45,929 --> 01:13:49,133
- The bag, bag! SailorMoon bag!
- Yes!!

934
01:13:49,962 --> 01:13:52,124
Sailor Moon bag..

935
01:13:56,748 --> 01:13:57,436
Like this.

936
01:14:04,289 --> 01:14:09,455
- Yeah, it was the bag!
- When did it happen? What's the date of it!?

937
01:14:10,692 --> 01:14:14,626
- Feburary 27, 1:15 lunch shift.
- Okay, okay.

938
01:14:14,626 --> 01:14:20,727
- Feburary 27..
- On 27th!? It's my son-in-law's marriage!

939
01:14:23,152 --> 01:14:25,401
- What the fuck.
- Water isn't coming out

940
01:14:25,401 --> 01:14:27,896
what the!! fix it!!

941
01:14:28,002 --> 01:14:30,535
Pipe got frozed, we weren't
able to take a shower!

942
01:14:32,551 --> 01:14:35,455
- Yeah, he's right! Temp -18!
- Yes.

943
01:14:36,995 --> 01:14:38,195
She slipped on ice!

944
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:43,300
Yeah! That's it!

945
01:14:44,099 --> 01:14:46,099
In market, there are

946
01:14:46,543 --> 01:14:47,640
full of ices

947
01:14:49,348 --> 01:14:51,648
how about the scar on her forehead?

948
01:14:53,531 --> 01:14:55,265
I heard there was a brick

949
01:14:56,329 --> 01:14:59,089
- yeah... there was a brick.
- A brick?

950
01:15:01,547 --> 01:15:02,955
Yes, yes.

951
01:15:03,607 --> 01:15:05,714
If the girl fell down like this

952
01:15:17,953 --> 01:15:19,753
what a crazy...

953
01:15:20,253 --> 01:15:21,564
how the hell is this..

954
01:15:23,230 --> 01:15:25,859
Everything is clear now
but why did you take off her pants?

955
01:15:27,841 --> 01:15:30,572
First, loosen the belt

956
01:15:31,536 --> 01:15:33,564
- helps blood circulation.
- Blood circulation!?

957
01:15:33,864 --> 01:15:35,656
- Yes.
- Then why did you choke her?

958
01:15:36,355 --> 01:15:37,455
I didn't choke her neck

959
01:15:38,896 --> 01:15:39,396
second,

960
01:15:40,696 --> 01:15:43,002
give a pressure on the chest

961
01:15:47,171 --> 01:15:47,671
next

962
01:15:48,471 --> 01:15:49,647
free airway

963
01:15:50,396 --> 01:15:51,350
cover one's nose

964
01:15:51,869 --> 01:15:52,891
12 times in a minute,

965
01:15:54,182 --> 01:15:55,390
give the air in.

966
01:16:01,657 --> 01:16:03,657
Okay, you are doing great.

967
01:16:05,449 --> 01:16:05,949
Next?

968
01:16:08,280 --> 01:16:11,379
Wake up, get up
wake up, are you okay?

969
01:16:11,380 --> 01:16:13,291
- Wake up.
- Good

970
01:16:13,491 --> 01:16:16,009
you need to shake him
so that he can wake up

971
01:16:16,597 --> 01:16:17,197
so... next?

972
01:16:19,431 --> 01:16:21,418
Pinch or slap

973
01:16:23,723 --> 01:16:26,098
- sir, you don't need to slap him for real.
- He's alive now

974
01:16:26,402 --> 01:16:28,825
- what the..
- Yes, he's alive..alive..

975
01:16:30,213 --> 01:16:33,740
So... everybody, after me
repeat..

976
01:16:34,094 --> 01:16:36,238
CPR!

977
01:16:36,489 --> 01:16:40,051
- CPR?
- Yeah..that's right.

978
01:16:40,574 --> 01:16:43,143
CPR, It's right..right..

979
01:16:43,736 --> 01:16:46,385
Dead one is a daughter of the attorney general

980
01:16:47,245 --> 01:16:49,348
they can't afford the long time to investigate

981
01:16:49,348 --> 01:16:52,611
guys from up there will give a pressure a lot
guys from down wants a change to promote.

982
01:16:52,967 --> 01:16:55,550
Who can't see this situation, poor YongGoo
went there, got suspected of a guilt

983
01:16:56,777 --> 01:16:58,477
fuck, we will do help YongGoo's trial!

984
01:17:04,768 --> 01:17:05,663
I have an objection

985
01:17:06,763 --> 01:17:09,479
these witnesses are testifying
what hasn't been proven.

986
01:17:09,776 --> 01:17:13,703
The statements they just testified,
there are no lies in there.

987
01:17:14,834 --> 01:17:16,234
Is that right?

988
01:17:21,201 --> 01:17:22,723
- Mr. Choi Young Ho.
- Yes, sir

989
01:17:24,128 --> 01:17:25,080
what's your job?

990
01:17:29,493 --> 01:17:31,493
- Hallelujah, I'm a pastor.
- I'm talking about the past.

991
01:17:34,376 --> 01:17:41,388
I...I don't know when are you talking about ..
It's just like a small group, we used to play a soccer and..

992
01:17:41,388 --> 01:17:45,286
- You were a member of gang, right?
- Yes..

993
01:17:45,759 --> 01:17:48,850
- Your honor, he is asking things that aren't...
- How about Choi Chang Soo?

994
01:17:49,123 --> 01:17:55,583
Since I was young, I had a dream about,
a treasure and a treasure chest, deep in the sea

995
01:17:55,583 --> 01:17:58,141
oh you are with seven previous convictions!?

996
01:17:58,341 --> 01:17:59,076
I have objection.

997
01:17:59,992 --> 01:18:02,870
The presecutor is abusing the witness's past
in this trial.

998
01:18:03,806 --> 01:18:04,706
Rejected.

999
01:18:07,385 --> 01:18:12,040
Gangster and a guy who has seven previous convitions
do they have credibilities?

1000
01:18:13,091 --> 01:18:17,763
Bro, no..I mean sir?
Do we have any law in criminal law

1001
01:18:18,099 --> 01:18:24,034
like "don't listen and believe
whatever gangster and swindlers say?"

1002
01:18:25,290 --> 01:18:27,190
- None, but...
- Look.

1003
01:18:28,246 --> 01:18:30,966
So, gangsters

1004
01:18:31,166 --> 01:18:33,884
always make bullshits?
Is there any law there like this!?

1005
01:18:38,523 --> 01:18:39,067
None..

1006
01:18:40,323 --> 01:18:42,522
I'm done with examination of a witness..

1007
01:18:42,522 --> 01:18:44,196
It's not Examination! It's a questioning!

1008
01:18:44,394 --> 01:18:45,703
Am I a student!!?

1009
01:18:49,538 --> 01:18:51,738
- Quiet!
- Sorry sir.

1010
01:18:53,234 --> 01:18:55,939
Lawyer, do you have any other witness?

1011
01:18:56,339 --> 01:18:59,299
As the prosecutor wanted, I have
one who never commited a crime,

1012
01:19:00,032 --> 01:19:03,032
but served this country with honor.

1013
01:19:04,279 --> 01:19:06,118
I call him as a witness

1014
01:19:26,796 --> 01:19:28,832
in Sungnam prison, security Chief, I'm Jang Min Ha

1015
01:19:30,716 --> 01:19:33,091
- as you know, there is a prisoner in our...
- How have you been doing?

1016
01:19:38,511 --> 01:19:40,497
I believe that you have 3 meals in a day,

1017
01:19:43,807 --> 01:19:45,207
you will exercise everyday,

1018
01:19:47,107 --> 01:19:47,789
and after 9 PM,

1019
01:19:50,090 --> 01:19:51,090
you will go to bed.

1020
01:19:54,204 --> 01:19:54,704
Sir..

1021
01:19:56,599 --> 01:19:58,199
I can't ask you this but..

1022
01:19:59,199 --> 01:20:00,638
I'm asking you to investigate again.

1023
01:20:02,435 --> 01:20:03,993
While we are investigating again,

1024
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:08,340
someday the prisoner will be released from the prison, right?

1025
01:20:12,676 --> 01:20:13,176
Lee Yong Goo.

1026
01:20:16,776 --> 01:20:17,830
He's not the criminal

1027
01:20:23,577 --> 01:20:24,077
have you..

1028
01:20:26,877 --> 01:20:27,877
Lost a son or daughter before?

1029
01:20:35,365 --> 01:20:36,365
I have lost..

1030
01:20:40,732 --> 01:20:41,932
By my favorite prisoner..

1031
01:20:50,943 --> 01:20:54,435
The accused,
you kidnapped the girl Choi Ji Young

1032
01:20:54,435 --> 01:20:57,534
to revenge on the chief of the commissioner
Is that right?

1033
01:21:00,368 --> 01:21:02,420
Yeah... I followed.

1034
01:21:03,207 --> 01:21:04,107
SailorMoon bag

1035
01:21:05,851 --> 01:21:08,951
papa, just read exactly what they've wrote for you

1036
01:21:09,450 --> 01:21:10,909
- Yeah...
- Read.

1037
01:21:13,709 --> 01:21:14,399
Ji Young said

1038
01:21:15,599 --> 01:21:18,948
she will let me know where I can buy the sailormoon bag,

1039
01:21:20,148 --> 01:21:21,479
so I just followed

1040
01:21:21,879 --> 01:21:23,084
- good!
- You are doing great

1041
01:21:23,320 --> 01:21:26,423
have you took off the victim's pants
for sexual molestation?

1042
01:21:27,212 --> 01:21:27,932
Have you? Or not!?

1043
01:21:29,239 --> 01:21:32,458
Loosen the belt first to help blood circulation
- yes!

1044
01:21:38,572 --> 01:21:41,247
I can't recall what really happened.

1045
01:21:41,512 --> 01:21:44,271
Have you smashed her head
to kill her?

1046
01:21:44,529 --> 01:21:47,337
No... Ji Young fell down...

1047
01:21:49,361 --> 01:21:52,472
Look, Yong Goo. What did I say.

1048
01:21:52,472 --> 01:21:53,833
If you can't remember what to say?

1049
01:21:55,093 --> 01:21:55,793
I..

1050
01:21:59,639 --> 01:22:01,667
- I don't remember..
- Yes. That's how you do it!

1051
01:22:01,918 --> 01:22:03,451
I don't..I don't remember

1052
01:22:03,649 --> 01:22:05,356
- Happily.
- Happily.

1053
01:22:05,527 --> 01:22:07,429
Okay, good job!

1054
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:10,135
- A brick fell on her head.
- Have you seen it happening?

1055
01:22:10,135 --> 01:22:12,249
- I haven't...
- What's wrong with you!

1056
01:22:12,250 --> 01:22:14,845
- Even if you haven't seen it, you should pretend!
- Then..

1057
01:22:15,944 --> 01:22:18,158
I was doing CPR...

1058
01:22:19,340 --> 01:22:21,418
Hey... Yong Goo... Yong Goo!

1059
01:22:22,051 --> 01:22:23,751
Do it in the morning, morning!

1060
01:22:24,663 --> 01:22:25,163
Yeah...

1061
01:22:27,874 --> 01:22:28,874
your

1062
01:22:30,273 --> 01:22:31,173
honor,

1063
01:22:32,021 --> 01:22:32,721
I..

1064
01:22:34,821 --> 01:22:35,563
Am..

1065
01:22:36,763 --> 01:22:38,398
An intellectually handicapped person

1066
01:22:39,998 --> 01:22:42,660
detectives..hit me ..

1067
01:22:45,172 --> 01:22:46,172
Without asking..

1068
01:22:47,083 --> 01:22:49,901
- Try to read it.
- What's this all about?

1069
01:22:51,215 --> 01:22:52,806
Famous line, so famous!
I am the one who wrote!

1070
01:22:52,807 --> 01:22:55,246
Sign on it, sign!
Don't you get it dirty

1071
01:22:55,701 --> 01:22:56,840
don't eat it!

1072
01:22:59,854 --> 01:23:03,637
They said if I make a fingerprint on the paper,

1073
01:23:05,478 --> 01:23:06,885
they will send me to YeaSeong and buy me SailorMoon bag

1074
01:23:07,885 --> 01:23:12,217
so these statements

1075
01:23:15,341 --> 01:23:17,541
are forged

1076
01:23:17,641 --> 01:23:18,788
perfect! Ended the case!

1077
01:23:18,789 --> 01:23:23,379
- Great
- Good job!

1078
01:23:24,057 --> 01:23:25,757
Mr. Lee Yong Goo!

1079
01:23:26,159 --> 01:23:28,691
- Yeah?
- National lawyer is here for you

1080
01:23:30,931 --> 01:23:31,731
come on

1081
01:23:33,180 --> 01:23:34,580
anything you wanna eat?

1082
01:23:35,307 --> 01:23:37,044
I can do those things..

1083
01:23:38,597 --> 01:23:39,197
"Break time."

1084
01:23:40,652 --> 01:23:43,591
- Chocolate?
- Yeah. Delicious "break time".

1085
01:23:44,510 --> 01:23:46,810
You got a daughter, Lee Yea Seong?

1086
01:23:47,789 --> 01:23:50,910
Yeah, Lee Yea Seong, daughter of Lee Yong Goo
Lee Yea Seong is pretty

1087
01:23:52,387 --> 01:23:54,687
- you listen to me.
- Yeah..

1088
01:23:55,664 --> 01:24:00,251
The daughter's father is the chief of the commissioner
- yeah..

1089
01:24:04,678 --> 01:24:06,181
You know polices?

1090
01:24:07,417 --> 01:24:08,317
Yeah... police

1091
01:24:08,738 --> 01:24:11,909
- scary..police.
- Yeah... the head of those scary men.

1092
01:24:12,661 --> 01:24:14,361
He's really mad now.

1093
01:24:15,151 --> 01:24:17,448
He might do something to your daughter

1094
01:24:19,248 --> 01:24:19,948
yeah..

1095
01:24:21,405 --> 01:24:22,153
Fucking annoying..

1096
01:24:24,938 --> 01:24:25,656
Lawyer

1097
01:24:27,100 --> 01:24:27,900
lawyer

1098
01:24:30,325 --> 01:24:31,025
this is..

1099
01:24:32,635 --> 01:24:33,835
A petition from the prisoners

1100
01:24:36,114 --> 01:24:38,114
this shit doesn't help.

1101
01:24:42,424 --> 01:24:44,724
Even though you are a national lawyer,
isn't it too much?

1102
01:24:46,338 --> 01:24:47,939
You think It will change with an effort?

1103
01:24:51,522 --> 01:24:52,222
Try to look at this

1104
01:24:53,075 --> 01:24:54,106
look at this!

1105
01:24:54,511 --> 01:24:57,659
Lee Yong Goo isn't enough smart
to write this!

1106
01:24:58,379 --> 01:24:59,800
You still think he's the criminal!?

1107
01:25:20,624 --> 01:25:21,924
For Yea Seong..

1108
01:25:23,340 --> 01:25:24,840
Stay awake, focus..

1109
01:25:26,611 --> 01:25:27,111
Yeah..

1110
01:25:28,711 --> 01:25:29,811
I will go home, home..

1111
01:25:31,174 --> 01:25:31,674
Yeah..

1112
01:25:34,168 --> 01:25:36,368
Don't you worry, you can go home.

1113
01:25:37,286 --> 01:25:39,186
- Okay?
- Yeah.

1114
01:25:44,894 --> 01:25:45,894
Ji Young said..

1115
01:25:48,079 --> 01:25:49,179
She will let me know

1116
01:25:50,679 --> 01:25:53,084
where to buy Sailor Moon bag

1117
01:26:12,542 --> 01:26:17,482
- tell the prosecutor everything, okay?
- Okay..

1118
01:26:19,072 --> 01:26:19,991
Word at a time

1119
01:26:22,546 --> 01:26:24,868
the accused, Lee Yong Goo

1120
01:26:25,249 --> 01:26:27,849
have you kidnapped Choi Ji Young

1121
01:26:28,402 --> 01:26:31,937
to revenge on the chief of the commissioner who hit you?

1122
01:26:37,286 --> 01:26:38,286
I mean

1123
01:26:38,977 --> 01:26:41,511
have you kidnapped Choi Ji Young?

1124
01:26:41,512 --> 01:26:46,348
You sacrifice yourself for Yea Seong
You know what I mean?

1125
01:26:46,740 --> 01:26:48,355
You are a father!

1126
01:26:50,587 --> 01:26:55,299
Have you smashed her on purpose
because she resisted

1127
01:26:56,099 --> 01:26:58,053
from the sexual molestation?

1128
01:27:05,208 --> 01:27:06,927
I am asking you again

1129
01:27:07,700 --> 01:27:10,905
have you smashed her head with a brick?

1130
01:27:13,414 --> 01:27:15,239
- The accused?
- Yeah?

1131
01:27:16,006 --> 01:27:17,606
- Answer me.
- Yeah?

1132
01:27:20,609 --> 01:27:23,821
Be purged of sin

1133
01:27:26,259 --> 01:27:28,218
or else

1134
01:27:29,907 --> 01:27:31,307
I will do the same to your daughter

1135
01:27:49,019 --> 01:27:50,019
answer me.

1136
01:27:52,082 --> 01:27:52,582
Yeah??

1137
01:27:57,875 --> 01:28:03,809
Is it true that you smashed Choi Ji Young
who's resisting

1138
01:28:04,056 --> 01:28:07,156
on purpose?

1139
01:28:14,235 --> 01:28:15,835
I..I'm asking you again.

1140
01:28:16,458 --> 01:28:19,758
Have you smashed her head with a brick?

1141
01:28:28,279 --> 01:28:30,366
With a brick, have you smashed!?

1142
01:28:34,790 --> 01:28:35,646
- The accused!
- Yeah.

1143
01:28:36,352 --> 01:28:40,654
- Have you smashed!?
- Yes, I have ...Yes.

1144
01:29:09,292 --> 01:29:12,323
Yeah, I did it. It was me

1145
01:29:14,463 --> 01:29:17,046
Lee Yong Goo! What the hell are you saying

1146
01:29:17,838 --> 01:29:19,258
wake up!

1147
01:29:20,107 --> 01:29:20,607
Your honor,

1148
01:29:21,583 --> 01:29:24,858
the accused is having a problem meantally, emotionally
quiet

1149
01:29:25,358 --> 01:29:28,069
lawyer! Do something!

1150
01:29:30,180 --> 01:29:32,254
- I killed, I did.
- Lee Yong Goo, Are you crazy!?

1151
01:29:32,882 --> 01:29:34,677
You killed no one!!

1152
01:29:35,100 --> 01:29:37,547
Because of me
because of me, she died

1153
01:29:38,084 --> 01:29:39,084
I'm sorry.

1154
01:29:40,091 --> 01:29:41,592
- I'm sorry.
- What are you sorry for!?

1155
01:29:42,051 --> 01:29:44,030
Nobody is saying sorry to you

1156
01:29:44,426 --> 01:29:46,227
what the hell are you saying for!!?

1157
01:29:49,111 --> 01:29:53,435
Yea Seong, help her
my Yea Seong..

1158
01:29:54,491 --> 01:29:56,700
I did it, Help Yea Seong.

1159
01:30:21,021 --> 01:30:22,452
What the heck are you doing!?

1160
01:30:25,137 --> 01:30:25,837
You are a lawyer

1161
01:30:27,809 --> 01:30:29,709
lawyer isn't for this!!

1162
01:30:36,240 --> 01:30:37,029
Detectives in that time

1163
01:30:37,915 --> 01:30:41,803
they took only witness's statements,
they completely ignored the accused's statement

1164
01:30:41,803 --> 01:30:43,114
even if he denied it

1165
01:30:44,014 --> 01:30:45,371
Lee Yong Goo's statement had been forged,

1166
01:30:45,971 --> 01:30:48,890
they interrogated with violence
forced, threathened him

1167
01:30:48,890 --> 01:30:50,666
Forged... Also

1168
01:30:51,327 --> 01:30:53,214
the scar on Choi Ji Young's
forehead isn't the main reason.

1169
01:30:53,214 --> 01:30:57,612
But the proof that the broken backhead is the
main reason why she died had been also ignored.

1170
01:30:58,747 --> 01:31:01,170
Lee Yong Goo's statement which is submitted by prosecutor

1171
01:31:01,841 --> 01:31:04,355
includes that he choked
her neck but

1172
01:31:04,803 --> 01:31:07,917
autopsy result that proves
nothing was found of any pressure on her neck

1173
01:31:07,917 --> 01:31:10,512
had also been... ignored...

1174
01:31:10,812 --> 01:31:12,803
lawyer, last defense.

1175
01:31:14,539 --> 01:31:15,639
Your honor,

1176
01:31:16,742 --> 01:31:20,081
I ask for favorable arrangements
please.

1177
01:31:22,001 --> 01:31:23,990
The prosecutor,
demand a penalty.

1178
01:31:27,537 --> 01:31:29,637
Since the accused had admitted..

1179
01:31:30,528 --> 01:31:31,528
We demand

1180
01:31:32,165 --> 01:31:37,161
a death sentence
for Lee Yong Goo

1181
01:31:42,264 --> 01:31:44,998
your honor
the investigation was focused on proving if he's guilty or not

1182
01:31:46,327 --> 01:31:49,509
without considering all the situations he's got.
It was defintely

1183
01:31:49,509 --> 01:31:52,047
a unreasonable investigation.

1184
01:31:52,574 --> 01:31:55,280
They ignored a basic principle
which is presumption of innocence

1185
01:31:56,299 --> 01:31:58,090
the fact that the accused is an intellectually handicapped person and

1186
01:31:58,761 --> 01:32:01,161
the fact the accused loves his daughter so much,
they abused them

1187
01:32:02,012 --> 01:32:04,460
to give up all the situations he had
for his... daughter

1188
01:32:06,260 --> 01:32:07,794
for the expediency of investigative authority,

1189
01:32:08,294 --> 01:32:10,847
- He is falsely accused..
- We,

1190
01:32:11,833 --> 01:32:13,790
the justice department,

1191
01:32:14,590 --> 01:32:16,176
since the accused admitted all the crimes,

1192
01:32:17,076 --> 01:32:20,338
we come to a definite decision

1193
01:32:20,838 --> 01:32:21,896
that the demand of the prosecutor,

1194
01:32:22,839 --> 01:32:25,639
a death sentence for Lee Yong Goo

1195
01:32:26,791 --> 01:32:28,391
the accused Lee Yong Goo

1196
01:32:30,006 --> 01:32:31,275
is given a death sentence

1197
01:32:39,103 --> 01:32:40,103
thank you

1198
01:32:42,554 --> 01:32:43,554
thank you

1199
01:32:45,448 --> 01:32:46,448
thank you

1200
01:32:48,762 --> 01:32:50,262
I did it all wrong..I..

1201
01:32:56,596 --> 01:32:58,864
Help Yea Seong. Yea Seong...

1202
01:33:02,619 --> 01:33:03,619
I'm sorry.

1203
01:33:08,329 --> 01:33:09,779
That's why I, the lawyer

1204
01:33:14,487 --> 01:33:17,605
am here to clear his name

1205
01:33:19,895 --> 01:33:20,795
from the false charge

1206
01:33:23,449 --> 01:33:24,956
from a sentence of death

1207
01:33:27,176 --> 01:33:28,076
to make things ..

1208
01:33:30,908 --> 01:33:32,119
All clear for him..

1209
01:33:35,602 --> 01:33:38,602
The lady will also send me in piano academy

1210
01:33:39,595 --> 01:33:41,695
yeah... Piano.

1211
01:33:42,940 --> 01:33:45,040
Mr's house, they even have a Piano.

1212
01:33:45,637 --> 01:33:48,337
Dad, I will play a piano for you later

1213
01:33:48,982 --> 01:33:51,582
Yeah... Piano is good... Piano.

1214
01:33:53,307 --> 01:33:53,807
Dad.

1215
01:33:54,995 --> 01:33:56,695
Dad, you are not a bad guy?

1216
01:34:02,631 --> 01:34:03,581
- Mr. Lee Yong Goo.
- Yeah.

1217
01:34:07,248 --> 01:34:08,248
- Bye bye.
- Bye...

1218
01:34:29,448 --> 01:34:29,948
I told you.

1219
01:34:30,281 --> 01:34:32,281
It's good to cook in the house
unlike..

1220
01:34:32,661 --> 01:34:35,258
Much better to buy from the restaurants
this is so annoying..

1221
01:34:35,962 --> 01:34:39,518
For Yea Seong,
It feels like It's a festive season today

1222
01:34:39,822 --> 01:34:42,965
look, this is what Yea Seong made
dark one is better, right?

1223
01:34:45,601 --> 01:34:46,456
You also ..

1224
01:34:49,956 --> 01:34:52,258
Yea Seong, Yea Seong.

1225
01:34:55,454 --> 01:34:57,554
Hi dad.

1226
01:34:58,869 --> 01:35:00,569
Dad how are you doing?

1227
01:35:01,125 --> 01:35:03,280
- Is it a letter from Yea Seong?
- Letter from Yea Seong..

1228
01:35:07,602 --> 01:35:10,572
- Boom!!!
- Wow, 100!

1229
01:35:10,573 --> 01:35:11,994
Yea Seong... 100..

1230
01:35:14,630 --> 01:35:15,630
Great job, Yea Seong!!

1231
01:35:15,831 --> 01:35:18,491
When she gets older
I should let her try to be a model or actress

1232
01:35:19,536 --> 01:35:20,236
bullshit

1233
01:35:21,562 --> 01:35:22,919
the baby looks so funny

1234
01:35:24,317 --> 01:35:26,668
- that dude is...
- Too honest.

1235
01:35:27,229 --> 01:35:28,049
Sorry

1236
01:35:45,124 --> 01:35:51,108
(can you hear me)

1237
01:35:51,108 --> 01:35:53,108
chi..

1238
01:35:53,908 --> 01:35:55,408
Ef...

1239
01:35:55,873 --> 01:35:57,759
C...H... I..

1240
01:35:58,118 --> 01:35:59,818
E...F...

1241
01:36:10,591 --> 01:36:11,871
How many hours more do you need!

1242
01:36:18,342 --> 01:36:19,742
C...H...

1243
01:36:20,716 --> 01:36:23,769
I heard there will be a talent show
for prisoners.

1244
01:36:23,769 --> 01:36:25,768
Shouldn't we prepare for it?

1245
01:36:26,594 --> 01:36:28,094
Who's barking here!?

1246
01:36:28,561 --> 01:36:30,441
If we win the first, do they let us walk away!?

1247
01:36:31,465 --> 01:36:32,414
Yes, they will let us walk away.

1248
01:36:32,971 --> 01:36:34,671
One night outing with family

1249
01:36:35,029 --> 01:36:35,660
really!?

1250
01:36:36,039 --> 01:36:38,745
- Yea Seong.
- What should we do? Sing in chorus?

1251
01:36:39,509 --> 01:36:40,209
Let's sing..

1252
01:36:41,029 --> 01:36:42,468
- SailorMoon.
- Yeah, let's try sailormoon.

1253
01:36:42,468 --> 01:36:46,266
So childish.

1254
01:36:50,412 --> 01:36:52,683
Chief, this special pardon in chirstmas,

1255
01:36:53,684 --> 01:36:54,623
so many of them ..

1256
01:36:56,770 --> 01:36:58,470
Is it because of the end of the presiden

1257
01:36:59,598 --> 01:37:01,670
I guess so..

1258
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:05,340
We got so many ..to send..

1259
01:37:10,688 --> 01:37:11,188
Excuse me?

1260
01:37:13,680 --> 01:37:17,278
We got a schedule for 5482
December 23.

1261
01:37:23,662 --> 01:37:24,888
- Spider.
- Loud.

1262
01:37:25,588 --> 01:37:27,079
- Spider.
- Louder.

1263
01:37:27,627 --> 01:37:29,858
- Spider.
- How about this one?

1264
01:37:30,428 --> 01:37:30,928
What?

1265
01:37:32,919 --> 01:37:33,678
This one..

1266
01:38:01,053 --> 01:38:04,245
That's not what I can't..
Decide myself..

1267
01:38:05,779 --> 01:38:08,922
I need a permission first
from the principal.

1268
01:38:09,650 --> 01:38:10,810
This will be the last.

1269
01:38:12,653 --> 01:38:13,153
Yes?

1270
01:38:17,472 --> 01:38:19,072
Last day for Yea Seong to see her father..

1271
01:38:22,274 --> 01:38:23,174
Please..

1272
01:38:26,370 --> 01:38:27,342
Please allow..

1273
01:38:33,960 --> 01:38:34,960
What the fuck..

1274
01:38:36,210 --> 01:38:39,650
It's been only few days after the trial,
execution of a death penalty!? what the fuck..

1275
01:38:40,512 --> 01:38:42,312
We need to protest about this

1276
01:38:42,865 --> 01:38:46,712
even if the trial went that way,
This is totally against the law

1277
01:38:47,667 --> 01:38:50,754
what the hell ..order..
I should go first than him..

1278
01:38:51,404 --> 01:38:54,696
So many guys to go first
in this prison

1279
01:39:00,887 --> 01:39:03,287
we can't send YongGoo like this..

1280
01:39:05,420 --> 01:39:05,920
Hey Chun Ho.

1281
01:39:32,115 --> 01:39:34,679
This is to save a life
how's that sound?

1282
01:39:35,018 --> 01:39:37,856
Give me your area

1283
01:39:42,091 --> 01:39:44,036
- One.
- One.

1284
01:39:45,213 --> 01:39:46,753
What the heck

1285
01:39:47,706 --> 01:39:48,206
two

1286
01:40:07,130 --> 01:40:08,430
wor..wo..w..working?

1287
01:40:09,931 --> 01:40:11,131
Go back to work, work

1288
01:40:14,506 --> 01:40:18,830
you heard?
If you think a guy behind the curtain is your father,
