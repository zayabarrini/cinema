1
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:42,650
Go fuck yourself,
you son of a bitch. Bastard!

2
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,273
The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want.

3
00:00:46,274 --> 00:00:47,834
Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come.

4
00:00:47,858 --> 00:00:49,277
Thy will be done, you fuck!

5
00:00:49,443 --> 00:00:52,906
Give us this day our daily bread, as we
forgive those who trespass against us.

6
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:54,700
Jesus, Jesus the Nazarene.

7
00:00:55,128 --> 00:00:57,328
Jesus, the nazarene.
Go to hell. Go to hell. Go to hell.

8
00:00:57,329 --> 00:00:59,873
Hell! Hell! Hell! Hell!
Hell! Hell!

9
00:01:00,861 --> 00:01:03,501
Jim, you're not going to waste
the whole day lying around, are you?

10
00:01:03,502 --> 00:01:06,713
Ma, I'm up.
The loony alarm went off.

11
00:01:06,714 --> 00:01:10,010
Well, close the blinds. Don't look
at her and don't listen to her.

12
00:01:10,052 --> 00:01:11,052
How could I not?

13
00:01:11,596 --> 00:01:13,722
Jesus the Nazarene.

14
00:01:13,723 --> 00:01:15,891
Mary the whore.
Mary the hairdresser.

15
00:01:15,892 --> 00:01:17,612
Mary the hairdresser.
Our Father, Who art...

16
00:01:17,644 --> 00:01:18,436
Hey, lady!

17
00:01:18,437 --> 00:01:19,772
Shut up!

18
00:01:27,656 --> 00:01:30,410
<i>When I was young, about 8 or so,</i>

19
00:01:30,493 --> 00:01:32,536
<i>I tried making friends with God...</i>

20
00:01:32,537 --> 00:01:35,374
<i>By inviting him to my house
to watch the World Series.</i>

21
00:01:36,792 --> 00:01:38,169
<i>He never showed.</i>

22
00:02:18,508 --> 00:02:21,679
Too bad, Father.
I was just starting to enjoy myself.

23
00:02:24,307 --> 00:02:27,728
We can do it again tomorrow
if you like, Mr. Carroll.

24
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:45,039
You okay, Jim?
Does it hurt?

25
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,542
You want to
rub it for him, Pedro?

26
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:49,712
Jim, give it a rest.
You'll never beat him.

27
00:02:49,713 --> 00:02:51,296
The guy's a pervert.

28
00:02:51,297 --> 00:02:52,006
Did you hear him?

29
00:02:52,007 --> 00:02:54,167
"We can do it again tomorrow
if you like, Mr. Carroll."

30
00:02:54,843 --> 00:02:56,220
Let's cut out of here.
Come on.

31
00:03:06,857 --> 00:03:08,442
<i>♫ I was born in a pool♫</i>

32
00:03:08,443 --> 00:03:10,152
<i>♫ They made my mother stand♫</i>

33
00:03:10,153 --> 00:03:12,322
<i>♫ I spat on that surgeon♫</i>

34
00:03:12,323 --> 00:03:13,781
<i>♫ And his trembling hand♫</i>

35
00:03:13,782 --> 00:03:15,409
<i>♫ When I felt the light♫</i>

36
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:17,161
<i>♫ I was worse than bored♫</i>

37
00:03:17,162 --> 00:03:19,038
<i>♫ I stole a doctor's scalpel♫</i>

38
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:20,874
<i>♫ And I slit the cord♫</i>

39
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,960
<i>♫ I was a Catholic boy♫</i>

40
00:03:23,961 --> 00:03:26,339
<i>♫ I was redeemed through pain♫</i>

41
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,049
<i>♫ Not through joy♫</i>

42
00:03:31,262 --> 00:03:32,638
<i>♫ I was two months early♫</i>

43
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:34,306
<i>♫ They put me under glass♫</i>

44
00:03:34,307 --> 00:03:36,142
<i>♫ I screamed and cursed their children♫</i>

45
00:03:36,143 --> 00:03:37,644
<i>♫ When the nurses passed♫</i>

46
00:03:37,645 --> 00:03:39,145
<i>♫ I was convicted of theft♫</i>

47
00:03:39,146 --> 00:03:40,939
<i>♫ As I slid from the womb♫</i>

48
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,607
<i>♫ They led me straight from my mother♫</i>

49
00:03:42,608 --> 00:03:45,153
<i>♫ To a cell in the tombs♫</i>

50
00:03:45,862 --> 00:03:47,823
<i>♫ I was a Catholic boy♫</i>

51
00:03:47,824 --> 00:03:50,492
<i>♫ Redeemed through pain♫</i>

52
00:03:50,493 --> 00:03:52,037
<i>♫ Not through joy♫</i>

53
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:56,201
<i>♫ They starved me for weeks♫</i>

54
00:03:56,225 --> 00:03:57,793
<i>♫ They thought
they'd teach me fear♫</i>

55
00:03:57,794 --> 00:03:59,545
<i>♫ I fed on cellmates' dreams♫</i>

56
00:03:59,546 --> 00:04:01,422
<i>♫ It gave me fine ideas♫</i>

57
00:04:01,423 --> 00:04:03,174
<i>♫ When they cut me loose♫</i>

58
00:04:03,175 --> 00:04:04,634
<i>♫ The time had served me well♫</i>

59
00:04:04,635 --> 00:04:06,803
<i>♫ I'd made allies in heaven♫</i>

60
00:04:06,804 --> 00:04:09,015
<i>♫ Comrades in hell♫</i>

61
00:04:09,016 --> 00:04:11,892
<i>♫ I was a Catholic child♫</i>

62
00:04:11,893 --> 00:04:13,728
<i>♫ The blood ran red♫</i>

63
00:04:13,729 --> 00:04:21,729
<i>♫ The blood ran wild♫</i>♫

64
00:04:23,491 --> 00:04:26,703
Why, you little prick!
This is my new...

65
00:04:26,704 --> 00:04:28,944
Shit, guys, gotta get outta here.
I threw up on somebody.

66
00:04:28,968 --> 00:04:30,094
I'll get ya!

67
00:04:37,007 --> 00:04:38,009
You little prick!

68
00:04:40,678 --> 00:04:43,181
I'll fucking throw you
in the fucking river if I catch ya...

69
00:04:58,074 --> 00:04:59,242
Hey!

70
00:05:02,746 --> 00:05:05,498
What about the four of us
versus Wilt Chamberlain?

71
00:05:05,499 --> 00:05:06,792
He was the greatest of all time.

72
00:05:06,793 --> 00:05:07,544
Four of us?

73
00:05:07,545 --> 00:05:08,710
What are you gonna do, Pedro?

74
00:05:08,711 --> 00:05:10,471
Tie his shoes together
when he ain't looking?

75
00:05:10,506 --> 00:05:13,299
All right... How'bout the three
versus Wilt Chamberlain?

76
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,802
No problem.

77
00:05:14,969 --> 00:05:16,169
You're kidding, right, Mickey?

78
00:05:16,721 --> 00:05:19,099
No. He can't cover all of us
at the same time.

79
00:05:19,766 --> 00:05:21,268
You guys don't miss open jumpers.

80
00:05:21,269 --> 00:05:23,149
And you know who will be there
for the rebounds.

81
00:05:23,562 --> 00:05:26,274
Rebounds?
That freak is, like, 7 feet tall.

82
00:05:27,108 --> 00:05:28,652
Jim, I can rebound with anybody.

83
00:05:29,445 --> 00:05:31,965
You're sniffing too much of that shit,
that's what you're doing.

84
00:05:31,989 --> 00:05:34,616
Chamberlain would destroy all of us.
End of story.

85
00:05:34,617 --> 00:05:37,078
Alright. All we got to do
is move the ball around.

86
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:39,119
There's no way we don't win.
Will you tell this kid?

87
00:05:39,957 --> 00:05:41,877
Hey, Mickey, I think you could
beat him yourself.

88
00:05:41,901 --> 00:05:42,960
I don't think you need us.

89
00:05:42,961 --> 00:05:45,130
Perfect example... confidence.
I know I could beat him.

90
00:05:45,755 --> 00:05:47,007
Holy shit! Look at this place.

91
00:05:48,092 --> 00:05:50,219
I tell you what,
if our school was this nice,

92
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,380
I'd go more than once a week.

93
00:05:51,429 --> 00:05:52,430
You?

94
00:05:54,975 --> 00:05:56,560
We got a game today, gentlemen.

95
00:05:56,935 --> 00:05:58,688
Who's ready to play
some roundball?

96
00:05:59,814 --> 00:06:01,858
I said, who's ready
to play some ball?

97
00:06:02,651 --> 00:06:04,319
You give me that laid-back,

98
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,946
"I'm doing my own thing, Jack"
attitude out there today,

99
00:06:06,947 --> 00:06:09,909
and you're going to find yourself
watching the game from the bench.

100
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:14,081
No smoking, lggy...
stunts your growth.

101
00:06:14,748 --> 00:06:16,792
You want to be big and strong
like me, don't you?

102
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:17,961
Out.

103
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:21,381
No smoking,

104
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:24,093
and no pulling your peckers
before a game.

105
00:06:25,971 --> 00:06:28,598
Swifty, do you mind?
I'm taking a dump. Get outta here!

106
00:06:29,892 --> 00:06:31,143
Something die in there?

107
00:06:31,478 --> 00:06:32,478
<i>When we play our game...</i>

108
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,646
...so Pedro vomits
on his head, right?

109
00:06:34,647 --> 00:06:38,109
It goes all over his hair,
trickles down his neck.

110
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:39,550
Some gets in his eye.
He went nuts...

111
00:06:39,574 --> 00:06:41,488
Don't lie about it, either.

112
00:06:41,489 --> 00:06:43,282
What are you doing?

113
00:06:43,699 --> 00:06:44,992
We're signing a ball for Bobby.

114
00:06:44,993 --> 00:06:46,328
Can I sign?

115
00:06:46,703 --> 00:06:47,830
Yeah.

116
00:06:55,005 --> 00:06:58,676
"We're holding
your spot for you, kid.

117
00:06:59,302 --> 00:07:00,428
Swifty."

118
00:07:01,846 --> 00:07:02,931
All right.

119
00:07:04,725 --> 00:07:06,185
This one's for Bobby.

120
00:07:06,769 --> 00:07:08,354
All right.

121
00:07:11,274 --> 00:07:12,650
Who's better than we are?

122
00:07:12,651 --> 00:07:14,069
Nobody!

123
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,946
Alright! Go ahead.
Do some warm-ups.

124
00:07:15,988 --> 00:07:17,072
Pedro, you're in charge.

125
00:07:17,073 --> 00:07:19,117
You're my eyes and ears.

126
00:07:22,705 --> 00:07:23,915
- Hey, Jim?
- Yeah?

127
00:07:26,209 --> 00:07:28,127
That's a nice thing
you're doing for Bobby.

128
00:07:28,128 --> 00:07:30,047
Oh, thanks.
Thanks.

129
00:07:31,799 --> 00:07:33,008
You seen Neutron?

130
00:07:33,009 --> 00:07:36,805
I think he's talking to a scout from Saint
John's, as a matter of fact, upstairs.

131
00:07:38,014 --> 00:07:39,724
You want to play
college ball, don't you?

132
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:41,769
Yeah. Someday, I hope.
You know.

133
00:07:42,437 --> 00:07:43,687
Yeah.

134
00:07:43,688 --> 00:07:45,440
Scouts are sniffing
you out already.

135
00:07:45,441 --> 00:07:46,734
They like them young.

136
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:50,196
I'll tell you what.

137
00:07:50,738 --> 00:07:53,659
You come by sometime, and
we'll go over the schools together.

138
00:07:55,118 --> 00:07:56,661
Yeah. All right.

139
00:07:56,662 --> 00:07:59,498
Yeah. We'll get a pizza,
and we'll make a night of it.

140
00:08:01,167 --> 00:08:03,754
Um... actually, my nights are
kind of busy right now.

141
00:08:05,547 --> 00:08:06,590
Yeah.

142
00:08:06,882 --> 00:08:08,050
Homework and all, huh?

143
00:08:08,051 --> 00:08:09,594
Yeah. Yeah.

144
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:15,434
We were the hottest Catholic
high school team in New York City,

145
00:08:15,435 --> 00:08:17,853
on our way to the championship.

146
00:08:18,563 --> 00:08:20,398
We felt like nothing could stop us.

147
00:08:23,944 --> 00:08:25,362
<i>Yeah! Yeah!</i>

148
00:08:25,363 --> 00:08:26,864
Yes!
We're on our way.

149
00:08:26,865 --> 00:08:28,282
We're on our way.

150
00:08:28,283 --> 00:08:29,742
Let's go.
Let's go.

151
00:08:29,743 --> 00:08:31,369
Hands up.
Show me some defense.

152
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:32,788
Show me some defense.

153
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:34,749
Good steal.
Put it in. Put it in.

154
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:36,042
Yeah!

155
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:40,338
All right. All right.

156
00:08:40,339 --> 00:08:42,174
Way to go.

157
00:08:43,385 --> 00:08:45,094
Aw, geez.

158
00:08:45,095 --> 00:08:47,555
All right, Neutron.
Yes! Yes!

159
00:08:47,556 --> 00:08:48,641
To the hole, Jim.

160
00:08:51,352 --> 00:08:53,313
Whoa! Whoa!
What's going on?

161
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:56,357
Break it up!

162
00:08:56,358 --> 00:08:58,778
Come on. Hit him!
Beat that motherfucker!

163
00:09:03,116 --> 00:09:05,703
<i>- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- He fucking held me!</i>

164
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:07,070
This dude blows the whistle...

165
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,207
Slow it down!
Slow it down!

166
00:09:37,115 --> 00:09:38,700
You got to have presence
on the court...

167
00:09:39,284 --> 00:09:41,412
presence like a cheetah
rather than a chimp.

168
00:09:41,871 --> 00:09:42,871
They both got it,

169
00:09:42,872 --> 00:09:45,292
but chimpy got to jump
his nuts around all day to get it.

170
00:09:46,126 --> 00:09:49,046
Shy cheetah just moves
in total nonchalance

171
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:52,968
a sec or two in his sexy, slow strut.

172
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,930
Me, I play like a cheetah.

173
00:10:04,398 --> 00:10:05,690
<i>Let's go, Rangers...</i>

174
00:10:05,691 --> 00:10:06,274
Let's go!

175
00:10:06,651 --> 00:10:08,861
Let's go, Rangers, let's go!

176
00:10:15,327 --> 00:10:16,370
Yeah! Ooh!

177
00:10:32,014 --> 00:10:34,266
You got it!
It's ours. It's ours.

178
00:10:40,733 --> 00:10:42,025
Oh!

179
00:10:42,026 --> 00:10:43,026
Yeah!

180
00:10:43,027 --> 00:10:44,152
9, 8,

181
00:10:44,153 --> 00:10:45,195
7,

182
00:10:45,196 --> 00:10:46,072
6,

183
00:10:46,072 --> 00:10:46,990
5,

184
00:10:46,991 --> 00:10:48,074
4,

185
00:10:48,075 --> 00:10:48,825
3,

186
00:10:48,825 --> 00:10:49,409
2,

187
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:50,494
1!

188
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:52,621
Yay, Jim!
Oh, shit.

189
00:10:52,622 --> 00:10:54,373
That's my team!
That's my team!

190
00:10:57,378 --> 00:10:59,295
There's only two things
Swifty forbids...

191
00:10:59,296 --> 00:11:01,465
using the word "motherfucker"

192
00:11:01,466 --> 00:11:03,675
and stealing from the other team,

193
00:11:03,676 --> 00:11:05,429
as long as they're white.

194
00:11:05,971 --> 00:11:07,771
How much for that
group of winners over there?

195
00:11:07,795 --> 00:11:09,141
It's $34.90.

196
00:11:09,142 --> 00:11:10,601
$34.90?

197
00:11:11,436 --> 00:11:12,980
Changed the prices or something?

198
00:11:13,313 --> 00:11:14,313
No.

199
00:11:15,858 --> 00:11:17,401
Uh...

200
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,321
I'm a little short.

201
00:11:19,654 --> 00:11:21,655
Do me a favor.
Here. Take my watch,

202
00:11:21,656 --> 00:11:24,118
and I'll come back later
with the rest of the money.

203
00:11:26,162 --> 00:11:27,288
No.

204
00:11:27,872 --> 00:11:28,915
What do you mean, no?

205
00:11:29,165 --> 00:11:30,208
I'm sorry, sir.

206
00:11:30,209 --> 00:11:32,377
Those burgers are worth
more than the watch is.

207
00:11:33,254 --> 00:11:34,589
I'll be right back.

208
00:11:36,967 --> 00:11:38,969
I told you one burger each,
didn't I?

209
00:11:39,678 --> 00:11:43,056
It takes at least eight of these
to get filled up.

210
00:11:43,057 --> 00:11:44,617
Yeah. C'mon, Swifty.
We're growing boys.

211
00:11:44,641 --> 00:11:46,809
Growing boys?
We're hungry motherfuckers.

212
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:48,980
Funny, huh?

213
00:11:48,981 --> 00:11:50,690
I'm not driving you guys home.

214
00:11:50,691 --> 00:11:52,318
How's that for laughs?

215
00:11:58,618 --> 00:12:00,578
You ripped them off, didn't you?

216
00:12:07,294 --> 00:12:08,503
We're even now.

217
00:12:08,504 --> 00:12:10,304
Swifty, come on. How are
we going to get home?

218
00:12:10,328 --> 00:12:12,038
Face the music, pricks.

219
00:12:14,344 --> 00:12:16,220
What are we going to do?
They got the door blocked off.

220
00:12:16,221 --> 00:12:17,597
You afraid of these pussies?

221
00:12:17,598 --> 00:12:19,058
I ain't afraid of anybody.

222
00:12:25,149 --> 00:12:26,274
What's the problem?

223
00:12:26,275 --> 00:12:28,485
I'm going to ask you
this once. All right?

224
00:12:28,486 --> 00:12:30,530
Where's the stuff you stole from me?

225
00:12:31,073 --> 00:12:33,200
What are you talking about?

226
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:35,994
No, no, no. You're not going
to fuck with me, all right?

227
00:12:35,995 --> 00:12:39,541
Now, somebody stole my father's
ring from my locker, motherfucker.

228
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:42,205
You want me to cut you?
Is that what you want, there?

229
00:12:42,712 --> 00:12:43,838
There's no problem here.

230
00:13:08,534 --> 00:13:10,094
Hey, guys! Let's
get out of here, c'mon!

231
00:13:10,745 --> 00:13:13,498
You need a fucking army, huh?

232
00:13:14,124 --> 00:13:16,126
Come on! Come on!

233
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:28,767
Oh. Nice.
That from Bobo?

234
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:30,601
Ha ha ha!

235
00:13:30,602 --> 00:13:32,355
That's his father's ring.

236
00:13:35,149 --> 00:13:38,194
Hey, fellas.
Any of you looking for a date?

237
00:13:38,653 --> 00:13:40,238
Yeah. Me, sweetheart.

238
00:13:40,239 --> 00:13:42,031
Little horsy ride
in Central Park,

239
00:13:42,032 --> 00:13:43,116
maybe candlelight dinner?

240
00:13:43,993 --> 00:13:46,328
Why don't we skip right
to dessert, huh, baby?

241
00:13:46,329 --> 00:13:47,914
About $15?

242
00:13:47,915 --> 00:13:50,835
Fifteen bucks? I'll give you a quarter.
Let Pedro suck your tits.

243
00:13:51,669 --> 00:13:53,503
You don't have to be rude.

244
00:13:53,504 --> 00:13:55,090
Oh, I'm sorry.

245
00:13:55,423 --> 00:13:57,216
How about you, handsome, huh?

246
00:13:57,217 --> 00:14:00,554
You got $15... for a little head?

247
00:14:01,723 --> 00:14:03,890
Diane, do I look like
I need to pay for it?

248
00:14:03,891 --> 00:14:05,768
Yeah...

249
00:14:05,769 --> 00:14:06,979
you do.

250
00:14:07,396 --> 00:14:09,106
If it's worth it.

251
00:14:09,107 --> 00:14:10,774
Jimmy...

252
00:14:10,775 --> 00:14:14,362
Jimmy, I know you want some, honey.

253
00:14:15,405 --> 00:14:19,494
$15. I'll do you so good
you'll never forget it, baby.

254
00:14:20,078 --> 00:14:21,120
Hey, hey!

255
00:14:21,121 --> 00:14:22,288
Ooh!

256
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:24,166
That's a deal.

257
00:14:24,167 --> 00:14:25,793
Bargain from there.

258
00:14:26,711 --> 00:14:28,951
What do you say, guys?
You want to do it? All four of us?

259
00:14:29,507 --> 00:14:30,507
- Yeah.
- It's a deal.

260
00:14:30,508 --> 00:14:31,592
All four of us.

261
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:36,013
Aw, shit. This is all I got, Diane.

262
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,184
Here, have a pretzel.

263
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:41,853
- Get out of here.
- Beat it.

264
00:14:41,854 --> 00:14:43,147
Yeah, fuck you!

265
00:14:44,148 --> 00:14:46,568
Fucking dopehead.
You see what that shit does to you?

266
00:14:47,569 --> 00:14:49,237
Wow. Speaking
of dopeheads,

267
00:14:49,238 --> 00:14:52,075
is that Pedro's mother over there
slinging her wares again?

268
00:14:56,038 --> 00:14:57,164
It is!

269
00:14:58,999 --> 00:15:00,418
Hey, Peepee, where you going?

270
00:15:01,043 --> 00:15:03,243
Why do you have to be
such an asshole all the time, huh?

271
00:15:03,797 --> 00:15:05,964
Why is the little shoe
crying anyway?

272
00:15:05,965 --> 00:15:08,135
His mother's a sneaker.
His father's a loafer.

273
00:15:08,677 --> 00:15:10,388
Somebody's got to be a heel.

274
00:15:12,473 --> 00:15:13,600
Jim, where you going?

275
00:15:15,102 --> 00:15:16,228
Hey, Jim!

276
00:15:19,023 --> 00:15:20,315
Jim.

277
00:15:20,316 --> 00:15:22,027
Hey. Hey, man.

278
00:15:22,652 --> 00:15:23,652
What's up?

279
00:15:23,737 --> 00:15:25,822
You don't recognize me
with my new hairdo?

280
00:15:25,823 --> 00:15:28,576
It's nice. It's nice.
I like it.

281
00:15:29,411 --> 00:15:30,452
What's going on?

282
00:15:30,453 --> 00:15:31,914
- How are you?
- Good.

283
00:15:32,581 --> 00:15:34,832
Wow. Look at that.

284
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:36,001
You like it?

285
00:15:36,002 --> 00:15:38,086
Yeah, I'll tell you what.
When you get out of here,

286
00:15:38,087 --> 00:15:40,447
we'll all shave our heads and
look like a gang of skinheads.

287
00:15:40,632 --> 00:15:41,716
It's a deal.

288
00:15:41,758 --> 00:15:42,802
All right.

289
00:15:42,803 --> 00:15:44,135
I got something for you here.

290
00:15:44,136 --> 00:15:45,136
Yeah.

291
00:15:46,264 --> 00:15:48,016
Everyone on the team.

292
00:15:48,558 --> 00:15:50,728
Look right here...
even Swifty signed it.

293
00:15:51,604 --> 00:15:52,938
Thanks, man.

294
00:15:55,441 --> 00:15:58,986
You remember when I dunked on
that spade in Riverside Park?

295
00:15:58,987 --> 00:16:01,074
You always had good ups.

296
00:16:01,449 --> 00:16:02,449
Yeah.

297
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:05,120
Oh. I got something to
show you. Hold on.

298
00:16:05,162 --> 00:16:06,288
What?

299
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:11,586
Pedro got these
out of some lady's purse.

300
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:17,633
- She's doing it with a donkey.
- Oh, Jesus!

301
00:16:17,634 --> 00:16:19,512
Look at that schlong.
Look at that one.

302
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:21,973
Oh, I beat your record.

303
00:16:22,683 --> 00:16:24,141
How many times you choke it?

304
00:16:24,142 --> 00:16:25,434
Seven times.

305
00:16:25,435 --> 00:16:26,520
Bullshit.

306
00:16:26,521 --> 00:16:28,229
Seven times.

307
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:29,940
My mom thinks I have
a cold year-round

308
00:16:29,941 --> 00:16:32,110
because of all the tissues
around the house.

309
00:16:40,871 --> 00:16:42,748
You can keep those if you want.

310
00:16:43,665 --> 00:16:45,584
They're pumping
so much junk in me,

311
00:16:45,585 --> 00:16:48,755
I can't even get
a decent chubby.

312
00:16:54,386 --> 00:16:55,764
I got an idea.

313
00:16:58,475 --> 00:17:00,102
Come on. Let's go.

314
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:01,770
Where we going?

315
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:03,988
I'm getting you out of
this place, man. C'mon!

316
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,901
What are you, crazy, man?
I can't go anywhere.

317
00:17:06,902 --> 00:17:08,487
Here you go.

318
00:17:08,904 --> 00:17:12,408
I've known Bobby since I was 3.
He's my best friend.

319
00:17:13,243 --> 00:17:15,411
He was the best player
on our basketball team.

320
00:17:15,412 --> 00:17:17,832
Two years ago, he got leukemia.

321
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:20,377
He keeps fighting it off.

322
00:17:21,086 --> 00:17:22,670
I know Bobby's going to beat it.

323
00:17:23,463 --> 00:17:25,215
He could beat anything.

324
00:17:26,091 --> 00:17:27,302
Watch!

325
00:17:29,387 --> 00:17:31,639
Jim, you're going
to kill me, man.

326
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,308
If you let go, I swear...

327
00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:36,270
I swear I'll kill you, man.

328
00:17:36,937 --> 00:17:38,148
Watch the bump!

329
00:17:38,523 --> 00:17:40,566
What the hell happened
to forty deuce?

330
00:17:40,567 --> 00:17:44,153
Last time I was here, that theater
was playing Sperminator II.

331
00:17:44,154 --> 00:17:45,573
Oh, yeah.
I remember that.

332
00:17:46,574 --> 00:17:49,620
No, man. This whole block has been
done over by all these new artists.

333
00:17:50,245 --> 00:17:51,329
It's pretty cool, huh?

334
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:52,623
Yeah.

335
00:17:55,042 --> 00:17:56,962
They should put
your stuff up there.

336
00:17:58,463 --> 00:17:59,757
Yeah. Right.

337
00:18:00,591 --> 00:18:03,470
Still scribbling stuff in that
notebook of yours, ain't you?

338
00:18:04,095 --> 00:18:05,430
Of course.

339
00:18:06,556 --> 00:18:08,058
You bring anything for me?

340
00:18:08,892 --> 00:18:09,935
What, like to read?

341
00:18:10,227 --> 00:18:11,603
No, like to eat.

342
00:18:11,604 --> 00:18:13,231
What do you think?

343
00:18:13,981 --> 00:18:17,735
Yeah. I mean, I got this,
but it's not a big deal.

344
00:18:17,736 --> 00:18:20,321
I don't even remember writing it,
to tell you the truth.

345
00:18:20,322 --> 00:18:23,118
Yeah, Yeah. I'll be
the judge of this.

346
00:18:25,996 --> 00:18:27,915

347
00:18:28,499 --> 00:18:30,585

354
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:06,461
<i>♫ Didn't know where,
didn't know when...♫</i>

355
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,714
That's nice.

356
00:19:09,256 --> 00:19:11,674
<i>♫ Said that I'll go...
go learn♫</i>

357
00:19:11,675 --> 00:19:14,428
<i>♫ Put up my hand, wait my turn♫</i>

358
00:19:14,429 --> 00:19:16,556
<i>♫ But it never comes,
I have to shout out♫</i>

359
00:19:16,557 --> 00:19:17,890
<i>♫ That's life♫</i>

360
00:19:17,891 --> 00:19:19,269
<i>♫ And that's
what it's all about♫</i>

361
00:19:20,186 --> 00:19:22,438
<i>♫ So through the comfort
and the strife♫</i>

362
00:19:23,357 --> 00:19:25,775
<i>♫ What a life...♫</i>

363
00:19:32,367 --> 00:19:34,118
Get me out of here, Jim.

364
00:19:34,119 --> 00:19:36,330
What are you talking about, man?

365
00:19:37,206 --> 00:19:38,957
This was a stupid idea.

366
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:40,418
I don't feel so good.

367
00:19:44,256 --> 00:19:46,091
Well, can we wait
till the end of the show?

368
00:19:46,092 --> 00:19:49,096
Did you hear what I said?
I said get me the hell out of here!

369
00:20:17,421 --> 00:20:18,756
Hey, Bob, man...

370
00:20:20,007 --> 00:20:22,676
I'm really sorry, you know?
Next time, we'll go somewhere...

371
00:20:22,677 --> 00:20:24,388
Ain't gonna be
no next time, Jim.

372
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:41,658
I love it this way...

373
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:45,329
my feet against the tar,
which is soft from the spring heat,

374
00:20:45,746 --> 00:20:48,540
the slight breeze that runs
across your entire body,

375
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:50,127
especially your crotch.

376
00:20:51,461 --> 00:20:54,881
You feel an incredible power
being naked under a dome of stars

377
00:20:54,882 --> 00:20:59,137
while a giant city is dressed, dodging
cars all around you five flights down.

378
00:21:01,098 --> 00:21:03,725
I don't think of anything
while I'm doing the actual tugging,

379
00:21:03,726 --> 00:21:08,107
least of all the heavy sex fantasies
I have to resort to indoors.

380
00:21:09,441 --> 00:21:12,278
Just my own naked self
and the stars breathing down,

381
00:21:13,321 --> 00:21:14,865
and it's beautiful.

382
00:21:15,741 --> 00:21:18,243
Time sure flies when you're young
and jerking off.

383
00:21:20,663 --> 00:21:23,874
"Camp summer position.

384
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:25,960
Driver... taxi."

385
00:21:25,961 --> 00:21:30,049
Hey, that might be good.
You could get your license this summer.

386
00:21:31,259 --> 00:21:32,969
Oh, yeah, Mom.
That sounds really great.

387
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:35,681
Hey, get your own job,

388
00:21:36,014 --> 00:21:37,849
and if you don't
get it this summer,

389
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:40,352
you're coming to work
with me at the hotel.

390
00:21:40,353 --> 00:21:42,646
Mom, please. Why are you
so worried about this?

391
00:21:42,647 --> 00:21:43,940
Do I even ask you for money?

392
00:21:43,941 --> 00:21:45,692
No. I'm not worried
about the money.

393
00:21:45,693 --> 00:21:48,487
I want you to have
responsibility.

394
00:21:48,488 --> 00:21:51,407
I don't want you running
around the streets of New York.

395
00:21:51,408 --> 00:21:55,203
Idle time is
the devil's plaything, Jim.

396
00:21:55,204 --> 00:21:56,955
The devil's plaything, huh?

397
00:21:56,956 --> 00:21:58,541
Mm-hmm.

398
00:21:58,542 --> 00:22:01,545
That might be a cool title
for my first book. Thanks!

399
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:05,592
What are you talking about?
What are you writing?

400
00:22:06,718 --> 00:22:07,844
Here.

401
00:22:10,014 --> 00:22:11,306
Ooh. Um...

402
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:14,017
Ma, I'm not really that
hungry this morning, alright?

403
00:22:14,018 --> 00:22:16,187
- Come on. You got to eat something.
- I know...

404
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:17,313
Where you going?

405
00:22:17,314 --> 00:22:18,857
I'm going to shoot some hoops.

406
00:22:19,691 --> 00:22:22,277
Sometimes I feel like
something's chasing me,

407
00:22:22,278 --> 00:22:24,655
like there's some whacko
on a roof somewhere

408
00:22:24,656 --> 00:22:26,156
who could snuff me out
at any moment.

409
00:22:26,157 --> 00:22:29,619
And I feel this horrible fear.
Will I have time to finish...

410
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:31,581
The poems breaking loose
in my head?

411
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,169
Hey, white boy,

412
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:38,005
you ready for your beating?

413
00:22:38,006 --> 00:22:41,050
Don't let your mouth get you into
something your ass can't handle.

414
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:43,678
I'll shoot you for it.

415
00:22:47,975 --> 00:22:49,644
So it's going to be
like that, huh?

416
00:22:51,563 --> 00:22:52,856
I...

417
00:22:52,857 --> 00:22:54,566
don't think so.

418
00:22:56,278 --> 00:22:57,278
Yeah!

419
00:22:57,278 --> 00:22:58,196
All right, so you made one.

420
00:22:58,197 --> 00:23:00,531
Big deal.
You made one shot.

421
00:23:00,532 --> 00:23:01,741
Make another.

422
00:23:01,742 --> 00:23:05,162
<i>♫ The days are muzzled

432
00:23:40,622 --> 00:23:42,999
Yo, Jim! What's the score?
Come on. We got to go.

433
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,360
They don't keep score
in this game.

434
00:23:45,586 --> 00:23:47,797
Jim, come on.
We're losing the sun.

435
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:53,845
He's being a dick. You want me
to put a charge in his ass?

436
00:23:53,846 --> 00:23:54,680
Whatch this.

437
00:23:54,681 --> 00:23:55,765
Oh, look it, right here...

438
00:23:58,059 --> 00:24:01,354
Jim's secret diary
he's always writing in.

439
00:24:01,355 --> 00:24:03,565
Bet you he wrote
some shit about me.

440
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:07,111
Oh, right here.

441
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:08,614
"Spring... Mickey."

442
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:12,576
Hey, there I am, Jim says.

443
00:24:12,577 --> 00:24:15,871
"Mickey takes out a bottle
of carbonic cleaning fluid

444
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:18,291
and suggests we do
a little sniffing to get high."

445
00:24:18,833 --> 00:24:19,834
Whoo!

446
00:24:19,835 --> 00:24:23,505
"After four deep whiffs,
we're sailing someplace else."

447
00:24:23,506 --> 00:24:24,756
Mickey, what are you doing?

448
00:24:24,757 --> 00:24:26,509
"Bells ringing through my ears,

449
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:28,845
little lights
flashing through my eyes."

450
00:24:28,846 --> 00:24:30,889
Mickey, put that down,
all right?

451
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:32,224
"I pictured myself

452
00:24:32,225 --> 00:24:34,310
"paddling across a river
with black water,

453
00:24:34,311 --> 00:24:36,812
"only the canoe was going
backwards instead of forwards,

454
00:24:36,813 --> 00:24:40,525
"with clouds that had faces.
Laughing, spooky, fun-house laughs..."

455
00:24:40,526 --> 00:24:42,444
- Give it back, alright?
- What is that shit?

456
00:24:42,445 --> 00:24:44,614
Why do you have to be
such a schmuck, Mickey?

457
00:24:44,615 --> 00:24:45,782
What are you talking about?

458
00:24:45,783 --> 00:24:48,161
Don't you ever touch that again.
It's private.

459
00:24:49,495 --> 00:24:50,704
What's your problem?

460
00:24:50,705 --> 00:24:52,249
I'm... I'm sorry.

461
00:24:53,208 --> 00:24:56,628
He's writing about me,
I can't read about it? Jesus!

462
00:24:56,629 --> 00:24:58,338
Hey, Jim, come on.
We're gone.

463
00:24:58,339 --> 00:24:59,840
Yo, we got a cab!

464
00:24:59,841 --> 00:25:01,926
Hey, cabby! Hey, swami!

465
00:25:01,927 --> 00:25:03,970
So, Shakespeare,

466
00:25:03,971 --> 00:25:05,472
you going to finish the game?

467
00:25:06,182 --> 00:25:08,351
C'mon, Reggie, you know
this game never ends.

468
00:25:09,102 --> 00:25:10,354
See you later, all right?

469
00:25:12,606 --> 00:25:15,902
Every crowd has its little games
to prove if you're a punk or not.

470
00:25:16,694 --> 00:25:18,696
My cousin in Jersey
plays chickie,

471
00:25:18,697 --> 00:25:20,949
which is two cars
heading towards each other

472
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:22,743
at about 80 miles per hour.

473
00:25:23,452 --> 00:25:26,456
First driver to swerve
out of the way is, of course, chicken.

474
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:29,210
In Brooklyn,

475
00:25:29,211 --> 00:25:31,420
they make you press
a lit cigarette into your arm

476
00:25:31,421 --> 00:25:33,547
and have it burn all the way
down to the filter

477
00:25:33,548 --> 00:25:35,801
without the slightest flinch.

478
00:25:37,219 --> 00:25:38,511
Us, Manhattan boys,

479
00:25:38,512 --> 00:25:41,223
we jump off cliffs
into the Harlem River,

480
00:25:41,224 --> 00:25:45,520
which is literally shitty, because half a
million toilets flush into it every day.

481
00:25:45,687 --> 00:25:47,398
Whoo-oo!

482
00:25:48,774 --> 00:25:50,860
Yeah!

483
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:54,572
Oooh!

484
00:25:54,573 --> 00:25:56,074
Yeah!

485
00:25:57,118 --> 00:25:58,598
Hey, y'all, I carried the clothes up,

486
00:25:58,622 --> 00:26:00,245
but I ain't carrying them down.

487
00:26:00,246 --> 00:26:01,414
Peepee, this is you...

488
00:26:01,415 --> 00:26:03,667
all 33 pounds of you,
gone with the wind.

489
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:08,172
Wow. That's
a long way down.

490
00:26:08,173 --> 00:26:11,927
Devil's toe is no big deal.
We've all done it a million times.

491
00:26:12,761 --> 00:26:14,138
I never done it.

492
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,974
You never did it?

493
00:26:17,934 --> 00:26:19,353
Pedro, you never do nothing.

494
00:26:20,687 --> 00:26:22,230
You know who was awesome
on this rock?

495
00:26:22,231 --> 00:26:24,942
Bobby. That kids would do
back flips off this rock.

496
00:26:26,361 --> 00:26:27,361
Hey, Mickey.

497
00:26:28,405 --> 00:26:29,532
What?

498
00:26:29,949 --> 00:26:31,575
Don't talk about him
like he's dead.

499
00:26:32,451 --> 00:26:33,620
He's not dead.

500
00:26:36,999 --> 00:26:39,376
There goes the circle line.
Check it out.

501
00:26:42,047 --> 00:26:43,047
Whoo!

502
00:26:43,047 --> 00:26:43,882
Full moon!

503
00:26:43,883 --> 00:26:45,216
Whoo!

504
00:26:45,217 --> 00:26:46,550
Hey, yo!

505
00:26:46,551 --> 00:26:47,677
Whoo!

506
00:26:47,678 --> 00:26:49,220
Hey, circle this!

507
00:26:52,498 --> 00:26:54,018
Hey, I'm going.
Watch out, watch out...

508
00:26:54,019 --> 00:26:55,688
I'm going to show you
how to do it.

509
00:26:56,063 --> 00:26:59,275
Ye-ea-ah!

510
00:27:10,789 --> 00:27:12,081
That was a good jump.

511
00:27:12,082 --> 00:27:13,251
Oh, he's nuts.

512
00:27:17,255 --> 00:27:18,464
Hey, I'm going to walk down.

513
00:27:18,465 --> 00:27:20,466
What you talking about?
You can't walk down.

514
00:27:20,467 --> 00:27:22,135
There's no way to walk down.

515
00:27:22,136 --> 00:27:23,302
I ain't jumping.

516
00:27:23,303 --> 00:27:25,943
Pedro, your clothes are down there.
How you gonna get your clothes?

517
00:27:25,967 --> 00:27:27,761
You going to walk around
naked all day?

518
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:30,500
Pedro, if you don't jump,
Mickey's going to tease you so bad...

519
00:27:30,524 --> 00:27:33,194
You might as well just jump
and get it over with. Feel better.

520
00:27:34,985 --> 00:27:36,486
What the hell, right?

521
00:27:39,406 --> 00:27:40,865
Oh...

522
00:27:40,866 --> 00:27:42,076
shit...

523
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:43,160
Pedro!

524
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:44,286
Bad form.
Bad form.

525
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:47,123
Oh... My God!

526
00:27:47,124 --> 00:27:48,709
Oh, shit. Is he all right?

527
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:50,586
Pedro, you all right?

528
00:27:52,756 --> 00:27:54,090
You ready?

529
00:27:54,091 --> 00:27:55,341
Yeah.

530
00:27:55,342 --> 00:27:57,093
Listen, don't tell
the other guys,

531
00:27:57,094 --> 00:27:59,304
but when we leave here,
I got a surprise for you.

532
00:27:59,305 --> 00:28:01,015
Tell me what it is.

533
00:28:01,016 --> 00:28:03,936
It's a surprise. Trust me, all right?
Ouch, don't mess around, man...

534
00:28:05,042 --> 00:28:06,562
Alright, you ready?
Come on! You ready?

535
00:28:06,563 --> 00:28:09,149
- Let's jump.
- On three. Ready?

536
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:10,150
Uh-huh.

537
00:28:10,569 --> 00:28:11,737
1,

538
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:13,238
2,

539
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:14,824
3.

540
00:28:27,213 --> 00:28:28,465
Come on. Let's go.

541
00:28:31,218 --> 00:28:32,594
What's up, Manny?
How you doing?

542
00:28:32,595 --> 00:28:34,055
Fine.
Thank you, sir.

543
00:28:34,764 --> 00:28:36,140
This is my friend Jim.

544
00:28:36,141 --> 00:28:37,017
How you doing?

545
00:28:37,018 --> 00:28:39,226
I can't believe
I hit my head on that rock.

546
00:28:39,227 --> 00:28:40,563
It's killing me.

547
00:28:57,124 --> 00:28:59,543
Jim, um, this is Winkie.

548
00:28:59,544 --> 00:29:00,669
- Hi.
- How you doing?

549
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:02,005
Good.

550
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:06,176
And this...

551
00:29:06,177 --> 00:29:07,845
this is Blinkie.

552
00:29:08,722 --> 00:29:09,764
- Hi.
- Hi.

553
00:29:10,473 --> 00:29:13,810

00:29:21,653 --> 00:29:24,031
You're a very beautiful player.

558
00:29:24,907 --> 00:29:26,909
Very zen.

Yeah.

577
00:30:26,898 --> 00:30:30,360
This one's, uh, ribbed
for extra pleasure.

578
00:30:33,531 --> 00:30:35,116
So what are you waiting for?

579
00:30:35,117 --> 00:30:36,618
What do you mean?

580
00:30:38,036 --> 00:30:40,039
Take off your clothes.

581
00:30:41,957 --> 00:30:43,293
Well, uh...

582
00:30:44,377 --> 00:30:46,088

589
00:31:01,022 --> 00:31:03,859
White ship disappears in the
wave machine this morning.

590
00:31:05,069 --> 00:31:07,530
Your eyes got shut
with secret chains

591
00:31:08,823 --> 00:31:11,118
that pillow armies
eventually set free...

592
00:31:13,662 --> 00:31:16,249
like soft horses
through toy deserts.

593
00:31:35,021 --> 00:31:36,272
I love this mansion,

594
00:31:37,399 --> 00:31:39,568
though it's too many windows...

595
00:31:40,778 --> 00:31:42,822
to open halfway each morning...

596
00:31:44,699 --> 00:31:46,701
to close halfway each night.

597
00:33:00,498 --> 00:33:01,958
I looked at his body,

598
00:33:02,625 --> 00:33:04,961
and it was death
for the first time.

599
00:33:06,463 --> 00:33:09,508
His face was thin and wrinkled,
almost apelike.

600
00:33:10,427 --> 00:33:13,722
His hair, just gray patches
on his scalp.

601
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:18,228
He looked 60 years old,
and he was 16.

602
00:33:19,145 --> 00:33:21,482
Couldn't believe
how skinny he was...

603
00:33:21,732 --> 00:33:24,526
much skinnier than he was
in the hospital.

604
00:33:26,195 --> 00:33:29,866
It was like having the skeleton of someone
you knew put right in front of you.

605
00:33:33,204 --> 00:33:37,792
I felt dazed, like I'd just come out
of a four-hour movie I didn't understand.

606
00:33:39,962 --> 00:33:42,047
I kept thinking
about his face...

607
00:33:43,675 --> 00:33:44,967
and death...

608
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:48,096
what a cheat the
whole thing was.

609
00:33:49,806 --> 00:33:51,246
Hey, you guys remember
that Halloween

610
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:53,728
when Bobby filled that
paper bag with dog shit,

611
00:33:53,729 --> 00:33:56,105
lit it on fire and put it outside
Father Dunne's door,

612
00:33:56,106 --> 00:33:57,899
and we all hid
behind the dumpster?

613
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:58,900
Yeah.

614
00:33:59,735 --> 00:34:01,028
I could picture Father Dunne

615
00:34:01,029 --> 00:34:04,406
comming outside, stepping on that shit.
Picture him in the john...

616
00:34:04,407 --> 00:34:06,076
Scraping the shit
off his shoe like this.

617
00:34:07,869 --> 00:34:09,496
You think that'll
keep him out of heaven?

618
00:34:09,497 --> 00:34:11,917
Are you kidding?
Jesus Christ himself

619
00:34:12,125 --> 00:34:14,835
would have laughed at that.
It was hilarious!

620
00:34:14,836 --> 00:34:16,629
What about the time
at the formal

621
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:18,381
when Bobby got caught
in the bathroom

622
00:34:18,382 --> 00:34:20,551
with Mary Ann Dugan

623
00:34:20,552 --> 00:34:23,596
and McNulty came in
and busted him?

624
00:34:23,597 --> 00:34:25,306
He was, like, "Father, I swear.

625
00:34:25,307 --> 00:34:26,347
We weren't
doing anything."

626
00:34:26,371 --> 00:34:27,976
Meanwhile she's got
a giant wad of cum

627
00:34:27,977 --> 00:34:29,813
hanging off her face.

628
00:34:31,273 --> 00:34:33,943
I tell you, that kid
was definitely a pisser.

629
00:34:36,195 --> 00:34:37,696
It was weird
seeing him today, man.

630
00:34:37,697 --> 00:34:41,535
He was all shriveled up and wrinkled.
He looked like my grandfather.

631
00:34:43,579 --> 00:34:44,705
I'll tell you what, though.

632
00:34:44,706 --> 00:34:46,915
That kid was in so much pain,

633
00:34:46,916 --> 00:34:49,002
it's better off he died.

634
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,217
How the hell
would you know, Mickey?

635
00:34:56,553 --> 00:34:58,054
Did you go and visit him?

636
00:34:58,973 --> 00:35:00,182
Huh?

637
00:35:01,434 --> 00:35:03,228
Any of you guys
go and visit him?

638
00:35:06,815 --> 00:35:08,776
All right.
Then shut the fuck up.

639
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:12,529
Hey, Jim. Look at my brother's
girlfriend in the park.

640
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:14,090
She's sitting there, eating a sandwich.

641
00:35:14,091 --> 00:35:15,811
Next thing you know,
she's shot in the head.

642
00:35:15,835 --> 00:35:17,036
She's dead.
It's over.

643
00:35:17,286 --> 00:35:18,745
What about little Teddy Rayhill?

644
00:35:18,746 --> 00:35:20,539
Perfect example.

645
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:22,208
Remember that night
he was up on the roof,

646
00:35:22,209 --> 00:35:25,879
and he was doing poppers, having
a great time, laughing his ass off

647
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,130
He started walking backwards...

648
00:35:27,131 --> 00:35:30,260
Boom! He fell right off
the goddamn roof.

649
00:35:31,219 --> 00:35:32,554
It was meant to be, right?

650
00:35:33,472 --> 00:35:35,892
Fuck that, you guys!

651
00:35:36,059 --> 00:35:38,979
Bobby was the best fucking
guy around, you know that?

652
00:35:40,397 --> 00:35:42,150
What are you, a bunch of idiots?

653
00:35:45,361 --> 00:35:47,364
You don't even understand,
do you?

654
00:35:59,503 --> 00:36:01,130
Jim, you all right?

655
00:36:02,507 --> 00:36:03,759
Huh?

656
00:36:06,595 --> 00:36:10,057
Listen, maybe you should talk
to one of the priests.

657
00:36:10,766 --> 00:36:13,477
I don't know. Maybe...
Maybe they can help you out.

658
00:36:13,478 --> 00:36:14,980
Help me out?

659
00:36:15,898 --> 00:36:18,651
I wouldn't ask one of those
cocksuckers for directions.

660
00:36:20,611 --> 00:36:22,071
You know what?

661
00:36:22,072 --> 00:36:24,573
You guys need to
lighten the fuck up, all right?

662
00:36:24,574 --> 00:36:26,952
Let bygones be fucking bygones.

663
00:36:26,953 --> 00:36:29,539
Shitty fucking world.

664
00:36:44,932 --> 00:36:47,686
Live life to the fucking fullest.
You know what I mean?

665
00:36:49,438 --> 00:36:50,604
Shit happens, man.

666
00:36:50,605 --> 00:36:52,525
Shit fucking happens.

667
00:36:57,238 --> 00:36:58,699
Come on.
Let's go.

668
00:36:59,992 --> 00:37:01,285
Jim, come on.

669
00:37:01,786 --> 00:37:03,287
You're growing up,

670
00:37:03,288 --> 00:37:06,249
and rain sort of remains
on the branches of a tree

671
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:08,001
that will someday
rule the earth.

672
00:37:10,171 --> 00:37:11,631
And that's good
that there's rain.

673
00:37:12,632 --> 00:37:16,554
Clears the month of your
sorry rainbow expressions.

674
00:37:18,889 --> 00:37:21,851
And it clears the streets
of the silent armies

675
00:37:22,894 --> 00:37:24,521
so we can dance.

All sorts of characters were in the
storage-room shooting gallery.

I was just going to sniff a bag,

698
00:38:44,408 --> 00:38:45,618
but a guy says,

699
00:38:46,327 --> 00:38:50,207
"If you're going to sniff,
might as well pop it,

00:38:51,417 --> 00:38:55,046
and if you're going to pop it,
might as well mainline."

701
00:38:56,214 --> 00:38:57,299
I was scared of needles,

702
00:38:57,758 --> 00:38:59,468
but I gave in.

703
00:39:05,392 --> 00:39:07,811
It was like a long heat wave
through my body.

704
00:39:08,979 --> 00:39:14,611
Any ache or pain or sadness or guilty
feeling was completely flushed out.

705
00:39:35,803 --> 00:39:40,057
Look, Ma, I'm not in the mood for your
dime-store psychology, all right?

706
00:39:40,058 --> 00:39:41,893
Could you just please
leave me alone?

707
00:39:41,894 --> 00:39:43,185
I got a little sick, all right?

708
00:39:43,186 --> 00:39:45,355
We're not going to
live like this, Jim.

709
00:39:45,356 --> 00:39:48,818
We're not going to live like this.
I'm warning you! I'm telling you.

710
00:39:48,819 --> 00:39:49,985
Oh, God, Mom.

711
00:39:49,986 --> 00:39:51,655
You're always warning me,
aren't you?

712
00:39:51,656 --> 00:39:54,824
Blah, blah, blah.
You're always in my fucking ear.

713
00:39:54,825 --> 00:39:58,203
Blah, blah, blah.
You don't know anything.

714
00:39:58,204 --> 00:39:59,664
What are you talking about?

715
00:39:59,665 --> 00:40:01,833
Go clean toilets or whatever
the hell it is you do.

716
00:40:01,834 --> 00:40:03,711
When you're done,
clean this one.

717
00:40:04,295 --> 00:40:05,712
Don't talk like that!

718
00:40:05,713 --> 00:40:07,716
What's the matter with you?

719
00:40:11,554 --> 00:40:13,305
Gee whiz, Ma, you know...

720
00:40:13,306 --> 00:40:16,308
we got to have these
heart-to-heart talks more often.

721
00:40:16,309 --> 00:40:18,229
They're really good for us.

722
00:40:19,355 --> 00:40:20,440
I don't know you.

723
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:25,237
I don't believe
this is you, Jim.

724
00:40:26,363 --> 00:40:28,615
Please, Jim.
I don't know who you are.

725
00:40:28,616 --> 00:40:31,786
Yeah, I know. I was such
a good little boy, right...

726
00:40:31,787 --> 00:40:33,829
with such potential,
wasn't that it?

727
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:35,958
Is that what
you're going to say?

728
00:40:42,758 --> 00:40:45,719
Oh, Jim.
What's happening?

729
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,722
Jim, what's happening?

730
00:40:49,349 --> 00:40:52,476
First, it's
a Saturday-night thing,

731
00:40:52,477 --> 00:40:55,481
and you feel cool,
like a gangster or a rock star.

732
00:40:56,441 --> 00:40:58,526
It's just something
to kill the boredom, you know?

733
00:40:59,361 --> 00:41:01,947
They call it a chippie,
a small habit.

734
00:41:02,781 --> 00:41:06,201
It feels so good,
you start doing it on Tuesdays,

735
00:41:06,202 --> 00:41:08,080
then Thursdays.

736
00:41:09,331 --> 00:41:10,707
Then it's got you.

737
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:13,293
Every wise-ass punk
on the block says

738
00:41:13,294 --> 00:41:14,503
it won't happen to them,

739
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:16,465
but it does.

740
00:41:21,387 --> 00:41:22,513
Go do it!

741
00:41:22,514 --> 00:41:24,015
I ain't doing it.
I always do it!

742
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:27,519
I'll do it.
I'll do it.

743
00:41:30,106 --> 00:41:33,819
Excuse me, ma'am. Could you tell me
the fastest way to the subway?

744
00:41:34,653 --> 00:41:38,948
Yeah. That's the "B" train.
Go to this corner and make a left.

745
00:41:38,949 --> 00:41:39,949
It's right there.

746
00:41:40,202 --> 00:41:41,786
What are you doing?
Let go! Let go!

747
00:41:42,495 --> 00:41:44,248
Let go of that!

748
00:41:44,373 --> 00:41:46,542
Oh, my God!
What? Oh!

749
00:41:47,752 --> 00:41:50,213
- Help! No! No!
- What are you doing?

750
00:41:51,382 --> 00:41:52,508
Let's go!

751
00:42:00,642 --> 00:42:01,894
Come on!

752
00:42:05,982 --> 00:42:07,525
I don't feel like going in today.

753
00:42:09,612 --> 00:42:13,366
Father, is it all right
if I don't go in today?

754
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:16,203
Why? What are you
scared of?

755
00:42:16,495 --> 00:42:19,247
Nothing. I just don't
feel like it, that's all.

756
00:42:19,624 --> 00:42:24,545
I imagine you have more to confess
than anybody here.

757
00:42:24,546 --> 00:42:26,214
Unburden yourself.

758
00:42:35,517 --> 00:42:38,103
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

759
00:42:38,104 --> 00:42:42,150
It's been about four months
since my last confession.

760
00:42:42,484 --> 00:42:44,778
Yes, my son?

761
00:42:46,697 --> 00:42:48,449
Well, I don't know
where to start, Father.

762
00:42:50,201 --> 00:42:52,621
Have you taken the name
of Jesus Christ in vain?

763
00:42:52,746 --> 00:42:55,081
Yeah. Yeah, I have.

764
00:42:55,082 --> 00:42:57,167
Have you disrespected
your mother and father?

765
00:42:57,168 --> 00:42:58,418
Uh-huh.

766
00:42:58,419 --> 00:43:01,048
Have you stolen
or cheated your fellow man?

767
00:43:03,217 --> 00:43:05,135
Yeah, but I'm not proud of it.

768
00:43:05,136 --> 00:43:06,469
Have you had impure thoughts

769
00:43:06,470 --> 00:43:09,014
or engaged in impure deeds?

770
00:43:09,015 --> 00:43:10,725
Oh, Father, you have no idea.

771
00:43:10,726 --> 00:43:14,230
Is there something else that you
want to tell me in your own words?

772
00:43:15,857 --> 00:43:18,609
I've done all kinds
of crazy shit.

773
00:43:18,610 --> 00:43:20,696
Oh, excuse me, Father.

774
00:43:20,863 --> 00:43:22,407
Fuck, I'm s...

775
00:43:23,324 --> 00:43:24,617
Christ, I have a dirty mouth.

776
00:43:24,618 --> 00:43:26,161
Look, I'm...
I'm sorry about that.

777
00:43:26,953 --> 00:43:28,498
Will you just go on?

778
00:43:29,123 --> 00:43:30,374
10 Hail Marys,

779
00:43:30,708 --> 00:43:33,003
five Our Fathers.

780
00:43:35,923 --> 00:43:37,090
What do you mean?

781
00:43:37,091 --> 00:43:38,216
And that's it?

782
00:43:38,217 --> 00:43:39,594
That's my punishment?

783
00:43:44,057 --> 00:43:45,767
You know something?

784
00:43:46,728 --> 00:43:49,230
My friend Bobby,
he was the best,

785
00:43:49,855 --> 00:43:51,441
and he's dead.

786
00:43:54,070 --> 00:43:56,405
This sucks! You know that?
This really sucks.

787
00:43:57,115 --> 00:43:58,450
It's not fair, Father.

788
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:03,329
Your nose is running,

789
00:44:03,330 --> 00:44:05,249
your stomach cramps,

790
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:07,459
your legs feel like
they've played

791
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:09,796
six straight games
on top of each other,

792
00:44:10,505 --> 00:44:13,092
and the voice is always there
in the back of your head...

793
00:44:13,884 --> 00:44:17,013
"Just one more time.
Then we'll stop."

794
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:39,623
Quick to the ball. Quick to the ball.
Two hands. Good, Ignatius.

795
00:44:39,832 --> 00:44:42,918
Good. Good. Quick to the ball.
Two hands. Right behind you.

796
00:44:42,919 --> 00:44:44,639
Sir, all right if I use
the bathroom, Coach?

797
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,040
Jim, you got a bladder
like a woman.

798
00:44:46,064 --> 00:44:47,139
Let's go. Again.

799
00:44:47,926 --> 00:44:49,635
There we go. Right behind him.

800
00:44:49,636 --> 00:44:50,553
Right behind him.

801
00:44:50,554 --> 00:44:52,431
Quick to the ball.
Two hands. Two hands.

802
00:45:20,590 --> 00:45:21,674
Jim?

803
00:45:25,136 --> 00:45:26,637
I thought you were
taking a piss.

804
00:45:26,638 --> 00:45:27,889
Oh.

805
00:45:27,890 --> 00:45:29,530
What are you doing in here
every practice?

806
00:45:36,024 --> 00:45:37,734
Have you been
waiting for me, Jim?

807
00:45:38,778 --> 00:45:40,404
Giving me some kind of a signal?

808
00:45:42,449 --> 00:45:44,493
What are you
talking about, Swifty?

809
00:45:45,703 --> 00:45:47,038
Don't act surprised.

810
00:45:54,338 --> 00:45:55,839
Do we understand each other?

811
00:45:59,927 --> 00:46:02,138
It's not going to
happen, Swifty.

812
00:46:02,139 --> 00:46:03,641
Put the money away.

813
00:46:03,891 --> 00:46:05,142
You want more?

814
00:46:06,936 --> 00:46:08,563
Here.

815
00:46:09,731 --> 00:46:11,191
Just let me do it.

816
00:46:11,192 --> 00:46:13,319
Get the fuck out of my face!

817
00:46:14,654 --> 00:46:15,821
Take it easy, Jim.

818
00:46:15,822 --> 00:46:17,740
You can't blame me for trying.

819
00:46:19,868 --> 00:46:21,036
I made a mistake, all right?

820
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:24,206
Let's just pretend
it never happened.

821
00:46:24,207 --> 00:46:26,667
Things will go back to exactly
how they were before.

822
00:46:26,668 --> 00:46:27,919
Okay?

823
00:46:28,295 --> 00:46:31,132
Okay? Here,
keep the money.

824
00:46:31,882 --> 00:46:33,426
Keep the money.

825
00:46:34,135 --> 00:46:36,138
Just don't tell anybody,
all right?

826
00:46:39,016 --> 00:46:40,684
Good. Tell anybody
you want!

827
00:46:40,685 --> 00:46:43,438
Nobody's going to believe
a drughead like you, anyway.

828
00:46:43,439 --> 00:46:45,440
You think we don't know
what you've been doing?

829
00:46:50,404 --> 00:46:51,530
Give me the fucking money

830
00:46:51,531 --> 00:46:52,948
and get the fuck out of here.

831
00:46:52,949 --> 00:46:54,910
Get the fuck...
Get the fuck out here!

832
00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:56,912
Come on!
Get out of here!

833
00:47:04,213 --> 00:47:06,340
And you want to stop.
You really do.

834
00:47:06,341 --> 00:47:08,133
But it's like a dream.

835
00:47:08,134 --> 00:47:10,219
You can't stop dreams.

836
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:13,139
They move in crazy pieces,
any way they want to,

837
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:16,895
and suddenly,
you're capable of anything.

838
00:47:57,902 --> 00:47:59,195
Ha ha ha!

839
00:48:21,722 --> 00:48:23,891
No!

840
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:42,204
Wake up, Mr. Carroll!
It's later than you think.

841
00:49:03,313 --> 00:49:04,565
Oh. All right!

842
00:49:05,733 --> 00:49:07,400
- I need a lift.
- All right.

843
00:49:07,401 --> 00:49:08,612
What do you got?

844
00:49:09,529 --> 00:49:11,949
Three different pills.
Which are the ups?

845
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:14,951
I never asked. I thought
one of youse would know.

846
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:15,994
Oh, great.

847
00:49:15,995 --> 00:49:17,788
We look like pharmacists?

848
00:49:17,789 --> 00:49:20,166
I don't know what to take.

849
00:49:20,167 --> 00:49:21,250
What do we take?

850
00:49:21,251 --> 00:49:22,251
Let me see.

851
00:49:22,252 --> 00:49:24,046
The blacks and the reds
are the ups.

852
00:49:26,174 --> 00:49:28,092
I think the pink ones
are the ups.

853
00:49:28,093 --> 00:49:29,218
Why?

854
00:49:29,219 --> 00:49:31,764
'Cuz I associate pink
with lightness, you know?

855
00:49:33,057 --> 00:49:35,350
The black ones seem like
they'd knock you on your ass.

856
00:49:35,351 --> 00:49:37,146
They might be faded seconals.

857
00:49:38,105 --> 00:49:39,313
No, they're not faded.

858
00:49:39,314 --> 00:49:40,775
They'd be sticky.
They're not.

859
00:49:41,567 --> 00:49:42,943
That's bullshit.

860
00:49:42,944 --> 00:49:44,780
- Fuck your mother.
- My what?

861
00:49:45,781 --> 00:49:47,156
All right!
Calm down.

862
00:49:47,157 --> 00:49:48,450
Don't ever talk about my mother.

863
00:49:48,451 --> 00:49:50,785
Don't ever hit me
like that again.

864
00:49:50,786 --> 00:49:53,664
Come on! Alright!
Give me your hat.

865
00:49:53,665 --> 00:49:54,958
We got a game to play, alright?

866
00:49:54,959 --> 00:49:56,543
Just give me something.

867
00:49:57,294 --> 00:49:58,629
Hi, Neutron.

868
00:49:58,630 --> 00:49:59,797
Let me ask him.

869
00:50:00,423 --> 00:50:02,551
Neutron, you know
which ones are the ups?

870
00:50:04,595 --> 00:50:07,348
I think you should put that shit away
before Swifty comes in here.

871
00:50:08,182 --> 00:50:10,101
Why you acting like
such a square ass?

872
00:50:10,102 --> 00:50:11,852
Screw you, Mickey.

873
00:50:11,853 --> 00:50:14,689
Screw you, too,
Tough guy. Man.

874
00:50:14,690 --> 00:50:18,528
I'm just going to
take the black.

875
00:50:19,195 --> 00:50:20,196
You sure?

876
00:50:20,197 --> 00:50:22,240
Mm-hmm.
You got a better idea?

877
00:50:22,241 --> 00:50:25,411
Nope. Your guess
is as good as mine, Jimbo.

878
00:50:27,706 --> 00:50:30,167
It's on today.
50 rebounds.

879
00:50:30,751 --> 00:50:32,335
Good.

880
00:50:32,336 --> 00:50:33,962
Come on.
Let's go.

881
00:50:33,963 --> 00:50:36,757
I'm your friend now, right?

882
00:50:36,758 --> 00:50:38,260
What, I got to smack
you again, c'mon!

883
00:50:43,641 --> 00:50:45,268
Yeah, take your
little rat with you.

884
00:50:46,979 --> 00:50:48,479
- What's up, man?
- Hey, what's up?

885
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:49,856
Why are you acting like that?

886
00:50:49,857 --> 00:50:51,775
You know what's wrong.

887
00:50:51,776 --> 00:50:54,528
Used to be about getting high
and playing basketball.

888
00:50:54,529 --> 00:50:56,169
Now it's just about
getting high with you.

889
00:50:56,193 --> 00:50:57,324
You're blowing it, Jim.

890
00:50:57,325 --> 00:50:59,565
Oh, come on. I don't need to
hear this from you, Neutron.

891
00:50:59,743 --> 00:51:03,831
Yeah, you do, Jim! Listen, no, Jim!
I'm really proud of you, man.

892
00:51:03,832 --> 00:51:06,167
Everything's cool.
You look great.

893
00:51:06,168 --> 00:51:08,129
I'll see you in the NBA.

894
00:51:45,799 --> 00:51:47,718

00:51:50,555 --> 00:51:52,724

909
00:53:10,942 --> 00:53:11,984
Did you find it?

910
00:53:11,985 --> 00:53:14,071
No, Father. It's clean.
There's no drugs in there.

911
00:53:14,990 --> 00:53:15,990
Thank you, Officer.

912
00:53:15,991 --> 00:53:17,742
I told you
we didn't have nothing.

913
00:53:25,334 --> 00:53:28,671
You boys think you're
awfully smart, don't you?

914
00:53:28,672 --> 00:53:32,092
Well, you're both
suspended for a week!

915
00:53:32,093 --> 00:53:34,136
Ooh...

916
00:53:34,220 --> 00:53:36,597
And you'll never play
basketball here again.

917
00:53:36,598 --> 00:53:37,974
That you can count on.

918
00:53:38,766 --> 00:53:40,935
You can't kick me
off the team, Swifty.

919
00:53:40,936 --> 00:53:43,565
Oh? Why is that?

920
00:53:44,565 --> 00:53:46,527
'Cause I quit the team...

921
00:53:49,154 --> 00:53:52,575
and the school and this whole
faggot-ass scene, that's why.

922
00:53:54,619 --> 00:53:56,120
I could second that motion.

923
00:53:56,121 --> 00:53:58,457
Your resignations are accepted!

924
00:54:01,294 --> 00:54:03,296
Neutron, you coming with us?

925
00:54:04,047 --> 00:54:05,382
Huh?

926
00:54:07,134 --> 00:54:08,593
Yeah. That's
what I figured.

927
00:54:08,594 --> 00:54:10,721
Come on, man.
I'm fucking out of here.

928
00:54:14,768 --> 00:54:17,271
Don't worry, Swifty.
I'm not going to rat you out.

929
00:54:21,401 --> 00:54:23,528
And in the next life, Father,

930
00:54:23,529 --> 00:54:25,696
I'm going to have the paddle!

931
00:54:25,697 --> 00:54:27,158
Get out!

932
00:54:28,326 --> 00:54:30,244
Thanks a lot, Neutron.

933
00:54:30,245 --> 00:54:31,788
Thanks, man.

934
00:54:45,555 --> 00:54:47,640
I can't believe this, you know?

935
00:54:47,641 --> 00:54:50,560
I know.
What happened to the pills?

936
00:54:50,561 --> 00:54:53,188
We got kicked out
of the school, Mickey.

937
00:54:53,189 --> 00:54:55,389
Who cares, man? We lost the pills.
The cops took them...

938
00:54:55,413 --> 00:54:57,832
We can't play ball anymore.

939
00:54:59,947 --> 00:55:01,906
Jim, who cares
about school, man?

940
00:55:01,907 --> 00:55:04,869
We just lost $40 worth
of pharmaceuticals.

941
00:55:06,163 --> 00:55:07,705
I know what
happened to them, too.

942
00:55:07,706 --> 00:55:09,834
The cops, they take
that all the time.

943
00:55:10,376 --> 00:55:12,627
They either pop them themselves

944
00:55:12,628 --> 00:55:13,796
or they sell them.

945
00:55:13,797 --> 00:55:15,966
What's my mom going
to say, man? When I go home?

946
00:55:16,843 --> 00:55:18,552
She ain't gonna say nothing.

947
00:55:18,553 --> 00:55:21,153
You just tell her you're going
to school every day in the morning.

948
00:55:21,177 --> 00:55:23,137
Let's get out of here, man...

949
00:55:26,103 --> 00:55:27,856
Go get into something.

950
00:55:29,274 --> 00:55:32,151
You never sold any pills
at the schoolyard?

951
00:55:32,152 --> 00:55:33,237
No.

952
00:55:33,487 --> 00:55:37,324
So it's all a big conspiracy
against you. Right, Jim?

953
00:55:37,325 --> 00:55:39,076
Yeah. Maybe it is.

954
00:55:39,077 --> 00:55:40,954
Maybe it's not.

955
00:55:41,455 --> 00:55:43,373
You been missing these?

956
00:55:43,374 --> 00:55:46,461
What are you going to tell me...
they're vitamins?

957
00:55:47,921 --> 00:55:49,631
Oh, fuck you, Ma.

958
00:55:49,632 --> 00:55:50,799
What?!

959
00:55:51,383 --> 00:55:53,093
Get out of my house!

960
00:55:53,094 --> 00:55:55,012
Oh, is that what you want, Ma?

961
00:55:55,013 --> 00:55:58,391
Get out! You don't
talk to me that way!

962
00:55:58,392 --> 00:56:00,752
If that's what you want,
I'm fucking out of here. All right?

963
00:56:01,604 --> 00:56:03,230
What are you doing?

964
00:56:03,231 --> 00:56:05,024
I'm leaving!
What do you think?

965
00:56:05,025 --> 00:56:07,653
I wan you to take all your shit!
I'll help you. Here!

966
00:56:09,364 --> 00:56:10,364
You want me to leave?

967
00:56:10,364 --> 00:56:11,157
Yes. Get out!

968
00:56:11,158 --> 00:56:13,283
I'm out of here.
Get the fuck out of my way!

969
00:56:13,284 --> 00:56:15,870
This garbage is
going to kill you, Jim!

970
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:17,080
I'm gone!

971
00:56:17,081 --> 00:56:18,666
Gonna to kill you!

972
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:26,800
Don't you understand? I can't
watch you kill yourself?

973
00:56:26,801 --> 00:56:30,596
Ma, you're never going to
fucking see me again, alright?

974
00:56:30,597 --> 00:56:32,014
Just remember that.

975
00:56:32,015 --> 00:56:34,685
Don't say that, Jim.
Don't say that!

976
00:56:35,979 --> 00:56:37,856
It was a dream,
not a nightmare...

977
00:56:39,232 --> 00:56:41,234
a beautiful dream
I could never imagine

978
00:56:41,235 --> 00:56:42,903
in a thousand nods.

979
00:56:44,405 --> 00:56:45,947
I saw this girl next to me

980
00:56:45,948 --> 00:56:49,077
who wasn't beautiful
until she smiled,

981
00:56:50,663 --> 00:56:52,539
and I felt that smile come at me

982
00:56:52,540 --> 00:56:54,125
and heat waves following,

983
00:56:54,584 --> 00:56:58,171
soaking through my body
and out my fingertips

984
00:56:58,172 --> 00:56:59,840
in shafts of color.

985
00:57:01,133 --> 00:57:02,552
And I knew
somewhere in the world...

986
00:57:03,553 --> 00:57:05,848
somewhere...
that there was love for me.

987
00:57:28,458 --> 00:57:30,000
We just got to raise enough cash

988
00:57:30,001 --> 00:57:31,420
to keep our heads straight.

989
00:57:35,841 --> 00:57:38,093
Luckily, finding money
in New York

990
00:57:38,094 --> 00:57:41,307
is like getting laid
at the prom... easy.

991
00:57:51,276 --> 00:57:53,695
- Fuck it, Pedro!
- What's the matter with you?

992
00:57:53,696 --> 00:57:57,158
Jesus! Watch the road.
You could kill us all, c'mon!

993
00:57:57,159 --> 00:57:59,077
I get 1,500 bucks for this car.

994
00:57:59,078 --> 00:58:00,787
If it's whacked up,
it's worth nothing.

995
00:58:00,788 --> 00:58:02,998
We should buy shit in bulk, man

996
00:58:02,999 --> 00:58:05,126
We'll put it on the street
and make real money.

997
00:58:05,168 --> 00:58:06,586
That's 500 bucks a piece.

998
00:58:06,587 --> 00:58:08,755
We'll be on for days,
nights, weeks.

999
00:58:08,756 --> 00:58:11,133
Yeah, man.
I'd love to go to Puerto Rico,

1000
00:58:11,134 --> 00:58:13,803
soak up some rays, you know?

1001
00:58:13,804 --> 00:58:15,179
See my bitch?

1002
00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:17,265
That's what I'd like to do.

1003
00:58:17,266 --> 00:58:18,946
- What are you talking about?
- What bitch?

1004
00:58:18,970 --> 00:58:20,560
We haven't seen
a picture or nothing.

1005
00:58:20,561 --> 00:58:22,438
She's 500 pounds, Jim.

1006
00:58:22,439 --> 00:58:24,441
She got a mustache
thicker than her father.

1007
00:58:24,442 --> 00:58:27,360
No. That's your
mother, Mickey.

1008
00:58:27,361 --> 00:58:29,822
She does not exist.
Don't fool yourself.

1009
00:58:29,823 --> 00:58:31,950
Be careful.
I'm about to whack.

1010
00:58:35,371 --> 00:58:37,165
Oh, shit, man.

1011
00:58:41,294 --> 00:58:43,631
My brother's going to take care
of us and this car.

1012
00:58:46,718 --> 00:58:49,137
Pedro, wake the fuck up!

1013
00:58:49,930 --> 00:58:51,055
Pedro, come on, man!

1014
00:58:51,056 --> 00:58:53,517
You're going to get us killed,
what are you doing?

1015
00:58:53,518 --> 00:58:54,519
I got it, man.

1016
00:58:55,144 --> 00:58:56,478
You want me to drive?

1017
00:58:56,479 --> 00:58:59,023
Mickey, you better drive the car.
I'm serious, man.

1018
00:58:59,024 --> 00:59:02,278
Just don't blow my high. If there's a
scratch in the car, my brother'll kill me.

1019
00:59:33,190 --> 00:59:34,316
Yo, get out of the booth!

1020
00:59:37,487 --> 00:59:38,863
Get out the booth, huh?

1021
00:59:39,822 --> 00:59:40,991
Get out.

1022
00:59:41,909 --> 00:59:43,243
Fucking...

1023
00:59:43,787 --> 00:59:44,787
What's up? What's up?

1024
00:59:44,788 --> 00:59:46,388
Come on, I'm in a hurry.
Where's the car?

1025
00:59:46,412 --> 00:59:48,416
It's good to see you, too.
It's over here.

1026
00:59:48,417 --> 00:59:51,294
It's nice.
It's smokin'.

1027
00:59:51,295 --> 00:59:52,504
You tell me that?

1028
00:59:52,505 --> 00:59:53,713
It's everything you wanted.

1029
00:59:53,714 --> 00:59:55,883
Get your hands off.
You guys look like shit.

1030
00:59:55,884 --> 00:59:58,596
Oh, my God.

1031
00:59:59,430 --> 01:00:00,721
They're taking the car.

1032
01:00:00,722 --> 01:00:02,516
Show me the sign, man!

1033
01:00:02,517 --> 01:00:04,059
Show me the freaking sign!

1034
01:00:04,060 --> 01:00:05,853
It's right there.
You see?

1035
01:00:05,854 --> 01:00:07,481
It says "tow-away." Huh?

1036
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:09,816
You scumbags even read?

1037
01:00:09,817 --> 01:00:11,484
I should kick
all your punk asses!

1038
01:00:11,485 --> 01:00:12,820
Goddamn it!

1039
01:00:12,821 --> 01:00:14,141
I can get you
another car tonight.

1040
01:00:14,165 --> 01:00:16,281
Yeah? John Halligan is
waiting for this car.

1041
01:00:16,282 --> 01:00:17,784
I got him out
of bed with his wife.

1042
01:00:17,785 --> 01:00:19,345
You know how this
makes me fucking look?

1043
01:00:19,369 --> 01:00:20,369
Kenny, get off.

1044
01:00:24,001 --> 01:00:25,586
You're too stupid
to be my brother!

1045
01:00:26,461 --> 01:00:27,461
You're too stupid!

1046
01:00:28,339 --> 01:00:29,673
You want a piece of me, Carroll?

1047
01:00:29,674 --> 01:00:31,635
Back off! Back off!

1048
01:00:33,011 --> 01:00:34,680
- Kenny, no more!
- Mr. Tough Guy.

1049
01:00:35,389 --> 01:00:37,808
- Kenny, no more!
- Huh? Tough guy?

1050
01:00:47,278 --> 01:00:48,404
Give me a sip of your soda.

1051
01:00:58,208 --> 01:01:00,169
You wipe off the bottle
before you take a sip?

1052
01:01:00,461 --> 01:01:03,255
You don't even think twice
about sharing works with Mickey.

1053
01:01:04,340 --> 01:01:06,220
You think you'll catch something
from the bottle

1054
01:01:06,244 --> 01:01:07,553
you're not catch from a needle?

1055
01:01:07,803 --> 01:01:10,138
You mistake me for somebody
who gives a shit.

1056
01:01:11,224 --> 01:01:13,850
Headquarters...
home on and off

1057
01:01:13,851 --> 01:01:15,853
to every down-and-out
junkie and wino

1058
01:01:15,854 --> 01:01:18,190
from 14th Street to the Bowery.

1059
01:01:19,066 --> 01:01:20,984
It's like a fucking
all-star team.

1060
01:01:20,985 --> 01:01:22,486
Jimmy, the other day,

1061
01:01:22,487 --> 01:01:24,238
my mother's been ragging on me,

1062
01:01:24,239 --> 01:01:26,241
"Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.

1063
01:01:26,242 --> 01:01:28,576
"You've tried every other way.
Go to church.

1064
01:01:28,577 --> 01:01:30,329
Put yourself
in Christ's hands."

1065
01:01:30,330 --> 01:01:33,416
So I do it, man.
I figure, give it a shot.

1066
01:01:33,417 --> 01:01:34,458
I dig Jesus.

1067
01:01:34,459 --> 01:01:38,213
So, I go, man. High mass...
a choir and everything.

1068
01:01:38,214 --> 01:01:40,966
The first thing I see
on the right, the side altar,

1069
01:01:40,967 --> 01:01:44,387
are those little candles
in the red glass

1070
01:01:44,388 --> 01:01:46,807
that we used when
it was windy in the park

1071
01:01:46,808 --> 01:01:47,851
to cook up.

1072
01:01:48,476 --> 01:01:51,521
And then, this altar boy,
he's coming down the aisle

1073
01:01:51,522 --> 01:01:53,606
with this 6-foot candle.

1074
01:01:53,607 --> 01:01:57,319
I envision this
huge spoon above it, man,

1075
01:01:57,320 --> 01:02:00,406
with, like, shopping bags
full of dope inside of it.

1076
01:02:00,407 --> 01:02:02,659
And then the kicker comes, man.

1077
01:02:02,660 --> 01:02:05,329
The priest, he starts doing
the thing with the incense.

1078
01:02:05,330 --> 01:02:07,247
You know, starts wafting out.

1079
01:02:07,248 --> 01:02:08,917
I'm in the back.
It finally hits me.

1080
01:02:08,918 --> 01:02:11,586
"Where do I know
this smell from, man?

1081
01:02:11,587 --> 01:02:13,755
My room, man."

1082
01:02:13,756 --> 01:02:16,134
It's the smell exactly

1083
01:02:16,135 --> 01:02:19,429
of really primo dope cooking up.

1084
01:02:19,430 --> 01:02:20,889
Yeah?

1085
01:02:20,890 --> 01:02:23,934
Exactly the same.

1086
01:02:23,935 --> 01:02:25,728
So what happened next?

1087
01:02:25,729 --> 01:02:27,605
At that point, I split.

1088
01:02:27,606 --> 01:02:28,899
I went home,

1089
01:02:30,277 --> 01:02:32,820
I went inside my closet,

1090
01:02:32,821 --> 01:02:35,907
I got my stash out
of the inside pocket

1091
01:02:35,908 --> 01:02:38,870
of my sharkskin easter suit,

1092
01:02:39,579 --> 01:02:42,832
and I got stoned.

1093
01:02:42,833 --> 01:02:43,916
Ba bing...

1094
01:02:43,917 --> 01:02:46,295
ba bang.

1095
01:02:48,548 --> 01:02:50,425
I love a ritual.

1096
01:02:53,179 --> 01:02:55,347
Oh, Mary, if you can hear me...

1097
01:02:57,433 --> 01:03:02,271
I need you to fill
Jim's heart with love

1098
01:03:02,272 --> 01:03:05,735
because he really needs it now.

1099
01:03:10,449 --> 01:03:12,034
Oh, God...

1100
01:03:13,745 --> 01:03:16,539
please watch over my son.

1101
01:03:18,250 --> 01:03:20,627
He needs you now.

1102
01:03:24,591 --> 01:03:26,300
Just take care of him, okay?

1103
01:03:26,301 --> 01:03:28,012
I'll be okay.

1104
01:03:38,315 --> 01:03:40,609
I love you, Jim.

1105
01:03:40,610 --> 01:03:43,072
I love you.

1106
01:03:44,740 --> 01:03:48,160
Hey, you holding?
You straight, man?

1107
01:03:48,161 --> 01:03:49,912
Get out of here.

1108
01:03:49,913 --> 01:03:50,455
Come on.

1109
01:03:50,456 --> 01:03:51,873
No.

1110
01:04:03,762 --> 01:04:05,515
Hey, have you seen Falco?

1111
01:04:05,890 --> 01:04:08,809
Come on, man.
Are you holding anything?

1112
01:04:08,810 --> 01:04:11,522
Hey, Diane...
Come here, Diane.

1113
01:04:12,565 --> 01:04:14,233
- I'll take care of you, babe.
- Yeah?

1114
01:04:14,608 --> 01:04:18,070
Yeah. How about
some of this? Ha ha!

1115
01:04:18,071 --> 01:04:22,034
I wouldn't do you for a bag,
you fucking piece of shit.

1116
01:04:36,092 --> 01:04:37,677
Jim.

1117
01:04:37,678 --> 01:04:39,513
Jimmy.

1118
01:04:42,058 --> 01:04:43,977
You're looking good.

1119
01:04:43,978 --> 01:04:46,397
Who's your embalmer?

1120
01:04:47,816 --> 01:04:50,109
I want some of what you got.

1121
01:05:22,064 --> 01:05:23,482
Shh.

1122
01:05:33,077 --> 01:05:34,579
Check everything in this place.

1123
01:05:34,580 --> 01:05:38,710
Wow. I always wanted
to use these syrup pumps.

1124
01:05:42,422 --> 01:05:44,424
And these professional
ice-cream scoopers.

1125
01:05:53,435 --> 01:05:55,104
Oh, my God.

1126
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,418
Don't make me do it!

1127
01:06:14,419 --> 01:06:16,212
I'll do it!
I swear to God!

1128
01:06:23,346 --> 01:06:24,346
Jim, watch out.

1129
01:06:28,476 --> 01:06:30,271
Come on!

1130
01:06:32,816 --> 01:06:33,857
It's not opening.

1131
01:06:33,858 --> 01:06:35,692
They don't make them
like this anymore.

1132
01:06:35,693 --> 01:06:37,780
You got to get it from the side.

1133
01:06:38,447 --> 01:06:39,573
I got it!

1134
01:06:39,574 --> 01:06:40,658
Oh, cool.

1135
01:06:41,284 --> 01:06:42,576
Change!

1136
01:06:42,577 --> 01:06:44,246
Shit!

1137
01:06:44,830 --> 01:06:46,081
Let's get out of here.

1138
01:06:46,791 --> 01:06:48,458
It's locked.
We got to go out the back.

1139
01:06:48,459 --> 01:06:50,169
Pedro, let's get out of here!

1140
01:06:51,546 --> 01:06:53,631
What am I, hallucinating here?

1141
01:06:53,632 --> 01:06:55,550
Pedro, you'll get us caught.

1142
01:06:55,551 --> 01:06:57,303
The cops are going to come.

1143
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:03,101
Oh, you want to be tough, huh?

1144
01:07:03,102 --> 01:07:06,981
Go ahead... take another sip so I can blow
your fucking head all over the counter!

1145
01:07:07,190 --> 01:07:09,192
Go ahead, Pedro! Go ahead!

1146
01:07:09,860 --> 01:07:11,402
Come on, guys! Let's go.

1147
01:07:11,403 --> 01:07:13,863
Put that gun away!

1148
01:07:13,864 --> 01:07:15,144
Don't fuck with me,
motherfucker!

1149
01:07:15,145 --> 01:07:16,605
What the hell
are you doing, Mickey?

1150
01:07:16,606 --> 01:07:18,994
What the hell
did you do that for?

1151
01:07:18,995 --> 01:07:20,413
Let that little spic rot, man!

1152
01:07:20,414 --> 01:07:21,581
He'll get us caught.

1153
01:07:21,582 --> 01:07:24,169
Jim, the cops are coming.
Come on!

1154
01:07:24,961 --> 01:07:26,004
Jim!

1155
01:07:28,006 --> 01:07:29,383
Jim!

1156
01:07:30,259 --> 01:07:31,511
Pedro! Pedro!

1157
01:07:37,351 --> 01:07:38,686
Jim!

1158
01:07:41,022 --> 01:07:42,356
Freeze! Freeze!

1159
01:07:42,357 --> 01:07:44,526
On your stomach!
On your stomach!

1160
01:07:44,527 --> 01:07:47,279
I didn't do anything,
I'm telling you!

1161
01:08:21,737 --> 01:08:23,446
This is it, man.

1162
01:08:23,447 --> 01:08:25,992
That Jew got to keep
the money under his pillow.

1163
01:08:28,746 --> 01:08:31,038
Hey, Jim, I know
you're still mad about Pedro.

1164
01:08:31,039 --> 01:08:32,958
I couldn't do nothing, man.

1165
01:08:32,959 --> 01:08:34,159
He was going to get us caught.

1166
01:08:34,460 --> 01:08:36,630
Definitely shouldn't have
went that far.

1167
01:08:38,215 --> 01:08:40,301
What happened to you?
Your mother kick your ass?

1168
01:08:41,844 --> 01:08:43,012
Yeah, real funny.

1169
01:08:43,013 --> 01:08:45,181
Bring us a couple of Cokes,
will you?

1170
01:08:47,601 --> 01:08:48,977
You all right?

1171
01:08:48,978 --> 01:08:51,147
Hey, bartender,
move out of the way.

1172
01:08:51,356 --> 01:08:54,359
Jim, I'm getting sick.
I got to get some money to cop.

1173
01:08:58,031 --> 01:08:59,115
Jim.

1174
01:08:59,448 --> 01:09:00,909
You with me here?

1175
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:05,246
What the hell are you wa...

1176
01:09:05,247 --> 01:09:07,791
Oh, shit.

1177
01:09:07,792 --> 01:09:09,209
That's Neutron.

1178
01:09:09,210 --> 01:09:11,672
That's the all-American
high school game?

1179
01:09:12,965 --> 01:09:14,675
We could have played
in that game.

1180
01:09:16,553 --> 01:09:17,969
Who gives a shit?
Come on.

1181
01:09:17,970 --> 01:09:20,348
I'm waiting to hear back on a
scholarship from Saint John's...

1182
01:09:20,349 --> 01:09:22,469
I'm not sure about it, but
hopefully it will work out.

1183
01:09:22,493 --> 01:09:25,173
Jim, I'm starting to jones.
Gotta get out there. We need some money.

1184
01:09:26,106 --> 01:09:28,148
Jim, don't dwell on
these dreams, man.

1185
01:09:28,149 --> 01:09:29,235
Will you come on?

1186
01:09:31,737 --> 01:09:34,908
Meet you outside, man.
I'm getting sick.

1187
01:09:35,283 --> 01:09:36,743
You want to meet me out there?

1188
01:09:36,744 --> 01:09:38,537
Is it okay if I say
hi to my mom?

1189
01:09:39,371 --> 01:09:40,498
Hi, Mom.

1190
01:09:41,165 --> 01:09:42,875
- Thanks.
- Thanks a lot.

1191
01:09:45,671 --> 01:09:52,971
<i>♫ You don't know it,
but you're coming right along♫</i>

1192
01:09:55,933 --> 01:10:03,399
<i>♫ Please be strong♫</i>

1193
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:11,400
<i>♫ You don't know it,
but you're coming right along♫</i>♫

1194
01:10:20,254 --> 01:10:21,974
Hey, you! Stop!
You can't go in there! Stop!

1195
01:10:34,021 --> 01:10:35,021
What do you want?

1196
01:10:35,022 --> 01:10:36,772
You realize what time it is?

1197
01:10:36,773 --> 01:10:39,567
Yeah. Um... is Winkie
and Blinkie here?

1198
01:10:39,568 --> 01:10:41,361
Who the hell
are Winkie and Blinkie?

1199
01:10:41,362 --> 01:10:42,571
Hey, guys.

1200
01:10:42,572 --> 01:10:44,741
Lisa, Mel, you know this boy?

1201
01:10:45,159 --> 01:10:46,493
No, Daddy.

1202
01:10:47,369 --> 01:10:48,536
Come on.

1203
01:10:48,537 --> 01:10:49,663
All right.

1204
01:10:49,664 --> 01:10:51,832
Come on.
Get out of here.

1205
01:10:52,823 --> 01:10:55,503
- I'm sorry, Mr. Rubin. He got past me.
- Don't let it happen again.

1206
01:10:55,504 --> 01:10:57,024
It won't happen again.
Get out of here!

1207
01:11:00,969 --> 01:11:02,303
What? What?

1208
01:11:04,473 --> 01:11:05,640
Asshole.

1209
01:11:05,641 --> 01:11:07,851
Hey, fuck-up,
get fucking up, man!

1210
01:11:07,852 --> 01:11:10,897
- What's your problem, man?
- What's YOUR problem, mam?

1211
01:11:10,898 --> 01:11:12,481
You sold my girlfriend
some shit the other day.

1212
01:11:12,482 --> 01:11:14,609
You almost killed her.
What was it... rat poison?

1213
01:11:14,610 --> 01:11:16,987
It's not my fault your girl
can't handle her drugs.

1214
01:11:16,988 --> 01:11:19,323
I want my fucking $20 back, man.

1215
01:11:19,324 --> 01:11:22,578
Look, there's no money-back guarantees.
I'm not selling refrigerators here.

1216
01:11:22,912 --> 01:11:23,454
Oh, yeah?

1217
01:11:23,455 --> 01:11:26,665
I'll cut you a dynamite
deal on mexican shit.

1218
01:11:26,666 --> 01:11:28,877
Give me my $20,
or we'll go outside.

1219
01:11:29,878 --> 01:11:31,798
If we go outside, one of us
is going to get hurt.

1220
01:11:38,847 --> 01:11:41,224
I told you one of us
would get hurt.

1221
01:11:41,225 --> 01:11:42,268
Is that right?

1222
01:11:53,406 --> 01:11:56,201
It's been hard...
the writing... lately.

1223
01:11:57,453 --> 01:12:01,958
Terrible numbness,
then suddenly it comes...

1224
01:12:03,251 --> 01:12:07,006
in beautiful fragments
or terrible dreams...

1225
01:12:08,132 --> 01:12:09,551
like nods...

1226
01:12:11,427 --> 01:12:13,639
so high.

1227
01:13:16,630 --> 01:13:18,216
Uh!

1228
01:13:26,851 --> 01:13:29,312
Reggie, is that you?

1229
01:13:30,272 --> 01:13:32,149
Who the fuck do you think it is?

1230
01:13:35,570 --> 01:13:37,447
Ohh...

1231
01:13:41,326 --> 01:13:42,579
Don't worry,

1232
01:13:43,496 --> 01:13:45,540
you're not dead yet.

1233
01:13:59,515 --> 01:14:01,393
It's not bad.

1234
01:14:03,478 --> 01:14:04,730
Hey, give me that.

1235
01:14:13,448 --> 01:14:15,034
How come it's all wet?

1236
01:14:15,743 --> 01:14:18,371
Because you pissed on it.

1237
01:14:19,414 --> 01:14:21,458
I didn't say
you could read this.

1238
01:14:22,501 --> 01:14:24,628
What, have you been
digging through all my stuff?

1239
01:14:31,720 --> 01:14:34,390
I need... I got
to get out of here.

1240
01:14:35,725 --> 01:14:36,726
Where's my jacket?

1241
01:14:36,727 --> 01:14:38,895
You're welcome.

1242
01:14:43,693 --> 01:14:45,528
What the hell am I
thanking you for?

1243
01:14:45,987 --> 01:14:49,825
Because you was frozen in the snow
like a goddamn creamsicle.

1244
01:15:04,801 --> 01:15:06,595
Where is it?

1245
01:15:08,013 --> 01:15:09,641
What?

1246
01:15:10,975 --> 01:15:13,979
You know what the fuck I'm
talking about, Reggie! Where is it?

1247
01:15:17,316 --> 01:15:19,527
You mean this?

1248
01:15:21,530 --> 01:15:23,449
Huh?

1249
01:15:25,451 --> 01:15:26,953
Give it to me.

1250
01:15:29,956 --> 01:15:33,419
I'll cut your fucking throat, Reggie!
Give it to me, all right?

1251
01:15:33,877 --> 01:15:34,963
Just give it to me!

1252
01:15:45,350 --> 01:15:46,851
Oh, give it to me!

1253
01:15:46,852 --> 01:15:48,352
Give it to me!
I'm serious!

1254
01:15:48,353 --> 01:15:49,855
Give me it!

1255
01:15:51,148 --> 01:15:52,442
Give it to me!

1256
01:15:53,359 --> 01:15:54,611
Goddamn it!

1257
01:16:01,661 --> 01:16:03,579
I'll make you
an incredible offer.

1258
01:16:03,580 --> 01:16:06,082
I'm going to save your life
twice in one day, understand me?

1259
01:16:09,336 --> 01:16:12,132
You should have left me
in the fucking snow, man.

1260
01:16:14,301 --> 01:16:16,470
Give me the money
for my dope, too.

1261
01:16:18,806 --> 01:16:21,642
I'm not gonna suck your dick,
all right? Put that away.

1262
01:16:21,643 --> 01:16:23,477
Who the hell wants you
to suck their dick?

1263
01:16:23,478 --> 01:16:25,188
Goddamn it!

1264
01:16:25,189 --> 01:16:27,441
Look at yourself!
Just look at yourself.

1265
01:16:41,083 --> 01:16:42,708
Oh, Reggie...

1266
01:16:42,709 --> 01:16:44,586
it's okay.

1267
01:16:44,587 --> 01:16:46,379
Why are you doing this?

1268
01:16:46,380 --> 01:16:50,511
Because once upon a time, somebody helped
me, and I always pay what I owe.

1269
01:16:56,101 --> 01:16:57,394
Reggie.

1270
01:16:59,104 --> 01:17:01,774
Reggie, I just need a taste.

1271
01:17:03,109 --> 01:17:05,863
I just need a little
something, Reggie.

1272
01:17:07,572 --> 01:17:09,367
You don't understand.

1273
01:17:10,201 --> 01:17:11,661
It hurts, Reggie!

1274
01:17:14,289 --> 01:17:15,625
Ow!

1275
01:17:19,254 --> 01:17:21,255
Reggie, I got to go.

1276
01:17:21,256 --> 01:17:24,258
I got to go see my mom.

1277
01:17:24,259 --> 01:17:26,846
You got to let me
get out of here, Reggie.

1278
01:17:28,014 --> 01:17:29,765
Reggie!

1279
01:17:30,726 --> 01:17:34,021
It hur...
It hurts.

1280
01:17:36,774 --> 01:17:39,235
Aah! Shit!

1281
01:17:42,198 --> 01:17:44,451
Oh, boy...

1282
01:17:50,541 --> 01:17:53,335
<i>♫ Touch the taste
and taste the smell♫</i>

1283
01:17:53,336 --> 01:17:55,964
<i>♫ Smell the scent, all the gifts
you gave to me, baby♫</i>

1284
01:18:00,136 --> 01:18:04,473
<i>♫ The food of your brain♫</i>

1285
01:18:04,474 --> 01:18:07,602

<i>♫ I never come down...♫</i>

1289
01:18:31,757 --> 01:18:33,092
Reggie.

1290
01:18:34,176 --> 01:18:35,844
You got to give me it.

1291
01:18:35,845 --> 01:18:38,222
You got to give me it, Reggie.

1292
01:18:39,099 --> 01:18:41,225
Please! Oh!

1293
01:18:41,226 --> 01:18:43,729
Reggie, come on!

1294
01:18:59,247 --> 01:19:04,838

1296
01:19:10,344 --> 01:19:13,014
Wake up.
Can't sleep all day.

1297
01:19:15,225 --> 01:19:17,102
Oh. Thanks.

1298
01:19:29,075 --> 01:19:30,702
Jesus Christ.

1299
01:19:31,494 --> 01:19:32,996
What happened to you?

1300
01:19:32,997 --> 01:19:35,248
What does it look like?
Motherfucker shot me.

1301
01:19:35,249 --> 01:19:37,418
Woke my black ass up.

1302
01:19:38,920 --> 01:19:40,505
Shit.

1303
01:19:40,506 --> 01:19:42,965
Look, uh... I'll be back
in the morning, Jim.

1304
01:19:42,966 --> 01:19:44,593
You just stay cool.

1305
01:19:44,594 --> 01:19:46,052
You start to get panicky,

1306
01:19:46,053 --> 01:19:48,806
write about me
in that book of yours.

1307
01:19:48,807 --> 01:19:51,102
Actually, I was a little hurt
I wasn't mentioned.

1308
01:19:53,187 --> 01:19:55,314
You really like my writing,
huh, Reggie?

1309
01:19:55,315 --> 01:19:57,232
Damn, man, I told you
four times already.

1310
01:19:57,233 --> 01:19:59,945
What do you want me to do?
Bend over and kiss your ass?

1311
01:20:05,619 --> 01:20:08,120
Hey, Reg, do me a favor.

1312
01:20:08,121 --> 01:20:10,291
While you're out,
pick me up a bag.

1313
01:20:19,761 --> 01:20:22,180
<i>♫ The room is spinning round♫</i>

1314
01:20:23,222 --> 01:20:27,520
<i>♫ I may never come down♫</i>

1315
01:21:07,818 --> 01:21:09,278
I am alone.

1316
01:21:12,740 --> 01:21:14,034
Not just me.

1317
01:21:15,285 --> 01:21:16,328
We're alone...

1318
01:21:17,663 --> 01:21:19,623
alone forever.

1319
01:21:21,793 --> 01:21:24,504
And who's at the end of that
forever tunnel I run through,

1320
01:21:25,089 --> 01:21:27,716
up Fifth with the wallpaper
of skyscrapers?

1321
01:21:35,475 --> 01:21:38,271
I'm thinking, after all
those beautiful trips,

1322
01:21:40,857 --> 01:21:42,777
that this is one
of those bad ones.

1323
01:21:44,987 --> 01:21:46,280
Diane?

1324
01:21:47,490 --> 01:21:48,741
Hey!

1325
01:21:51,245 --> 01:21:53,205
Jim. Remember me?

1326
01:21:55,166 --> 01:21:56,416
Man, you look great.

1327
01:21:56,417 --> 01:21:58,420
Yeah, thanks.

1328
01:21:59,921 --> 01:22:01,882
Good to see somebody
from the old neighborhood...

1329
01:22:01,883 --> 01:22:04,051
What do you want, Jim?

1330
01:22:08,057 --> 01:22:09,974
- You holding anything?
- No.

1331
01:22:09,975 --> 01:22:11,811
Just like a 5 or something?

1332
01:22:12,729 --> 01:22:14,439
Just to tide me over, you know?

1333
01:22:15,315 --> 01:22:16,942
Please, Diane?
Come on.

1334
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:21,154
Yeah. For an old friend?
Why not?

1335
01:22:21,155 --> 01:22:23,616
I've been looking
all over for this.

1336
01:22:23,617 --> 01:22:26,077
Oh, you know what?
I only got a 20.

1337
01:22:26,787 --> 01:22:28,079
A 20 is good.

1338
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:29,455
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

1339
01:22:29,456 --> 01:22:32,001
A 20 is great, yeah.
That would help me out a lot.

1340
01:22:32,502 --> 01:22:34,004
- You want a 20?
- Yeah.

1341
01:22:34,755 --> 01:22:38,760
Why don't you go buy yourself
some pretzels, you asshole.

1342
01:22:39,302 --> 01:22:42,680
You bitch!
You're nothing but a whore!

1343
01:22:42,681 --> 01:22:44,474
I don't give a shit
about your clothes!

1344
01:22:44,475 --> 01:22:46,434
You're still a whore to me!

1345
01:22:46,435 --> 01:22:50,773
Yeah? Shut up. Look at you.
Oh, are you desperate now, baby?

1346
01:22:50,774 --> 01:22:52,025
Who's a whore now?

1347
01:22:52,026 --> 01:22:53,943
Don't talk to me like that,
you bitch!

1348
01:22:53,944 --> 01:22:56,448
Ha ha.
Who's laughing, stupid?

1349
01:22:57,949 --> 01:23:00,494
Don't play a game with me!
I know you!

1350
01:23:03,539 --> 01:23:04,790
Ah!

1351
01:23:08,545 --> 01:23:09,796
Shit.

1352
01:23:09,797 --> 01:23:11,382
Oh, man.

1353
01:23:15,720 --> 01:23:16,931
Shit.

1354
01:24:27,097 --> 01:24:35,097
Ha ha ha!

1355
01:25:08,856 --> 01:25:10,189
Mickey.

1356
01:25:10,190 --> 01:25:12,316
Mick, what's up, man?

1357
01:25:12,317 --> 01:25:13,402
Hey, what's up, man?

1358
01:25:13,403 --> 01:25:14,861
Did you get anything?

1359
01:25:14,862 --> 01:25:16,197
No, not a dime.
You score?

1360
01:25:16,198 --> 01:25:17,783
Yeah, I got something.

1361
01:25:18,076 --> 01:25:19,076
What'd you get?

1362
01:25:19,077 --> 01:25:20,869
About 35 bucks.

1363
01:25:20,870 --> 01:25:23,373
35? Where'd you
get it?

1364
01:25:25,166 --> 01:25:27,211
I robbed some fucking asshole
on the "D" train.

1365
01:25:28,045 --> 01:25:30,839
Dude, 35 will keep us on
for, like, two days.

1366
01:25:30,840 --> 01:25:34,010
Well, could we get some stuff, man?
I'm fucking... my head is...

1367
01:25:34,011 --> 01:25:36,554
I see some spics. I think we can score.
You wanna check it out?

1368
01:25:36,555 --> 01:25:40,016
- Yeah, alright.
- Come on. They're over here.

1369
01:25:40,017 --> 01:25:42,813
Why the fuck do we have to cop
on the street all the time?

1370
01:25:43,313 --> 01:25:45,649
My fucking nuts are
itching like crazy.

1371
01:25:45,650 --> 01:25:46,817
Think this is him?

1372
01:25:49,613 --> 01:25:51,114
Is your name Pino?

1373
01:25:52,741 --> 01:25:54,742
Listen... could we
get us some dope?

1374
01:25:54,743 --> 01:25:56,995
The dude over there
said you could help.

1375
01:25:56,996 --> 01:25:58,830
You want to cop some shit?

1376
01:25:58,831 --> 01:26:00,208
Let me see some cash.

1377
01:26:00,209 --> 01:26:01,209
I got it here.

1378
01:26:01,210 --> 01:26:02,793
Let me see.

1379
01:26:02,794 --> 01:26:04,463
Hey, no money without no taste.

1380
01:26:05,047 --> 01:26:06,841
You want a taste?

1381
01:26:06,842 --> 01:26:10,052
Don't worry.
Don't worry.

1382
01:26:10,053 --> 01:26:11,221
Hurry, man.

1383
01:26:11,222 --> 01:26:12,742
Come on.
There's fucking cops all over.

1384
01:26:12,766 --> 01:26:15,267
That's good, man.
That's good.

1385
01:26:15,268 --> 01:26:17,437
All right, listen...
4 for 35.

1386
01:26:17,438 --> 01:26:19,063
4 for 35, man?

1387
01:26:19,064 --> 01:26:20,314
Come on, man.
$5.00 short.

1388
01:26:20,315 --> 01:26:21,400
What's the big deal?

1389
01:26:21,401 --> 01:26:24,152
Ta bien, chico...
Toma, toma.

1390
01:26:24,153 --> 01:26:26,323
- You got four?
- Yeah.

1391
01:26:28,451 --> 01:26:29,826
We should taste this.

1392
01:26:29,827 --> 01:26:31,327
Where are we
going to cook it up?

1393
01:26:31,328 --> 01:26:32,580
I don't know about his guy.

1394
01:26:32,581 --> 01:26:34,165
No, he's cool.

1395
01:26:35,626 --> 01:26:36,709
Fuck, man!

1396
01:26:36,710 --> 01:26:38,211
What's the matter?

1397
01:26:38,212 --> 01:26:40,548
- Just taste it! Come on.
- What do you mean? I tasted it.

1398
01:26:42,091 --> 01:26:44,343
He beat us.
He fucking beat us.

1399
01:26:44,344 --> 01:26:45,594
I swear to fucking God...

1400
01:26:45,595 --> 01:26:46,596
Put that away!

1401
01:26:46,597 --> 01:26:47,931
I'm gonna kill this mother...!

1402
01:26:47,932 --> 01:26:49,532
- Come here, motherfucker!
- Put it away!

1403
01:26:53,981 --> 01:26:55,900
I'm going to fucking
kill you, you motherfucker!

1404
01:26:57,360 --> 01:26:59,904
Motherfucker, you're fucking dead,
you hear me?

1405
01:27:32,944 --> 01:27:34,236
Dude, don't make me do it.

1406
01:27:34,237 --> 01:27:35,237
Where's the money?

1407
01:27:38,493 --> 01:27:39,493
I want the money.
I want the money and the bags.

1408
01:27:39,494 --> 01:27:40,828
Where's the fucking money?

1409
01:27:40,829 --> 01:27:42,371
The fucking money!
I want it!

1410
01:27:42,372 --> 01:27:45,751
Aah!

1411
01:27:45,793 --> 01:27:48,546
No!

1412
01:27:50,506 --> 01:27:52,717
- Oh, shit!
- We fucking killed him!

1413
01:27:52,718 --> 01:27:54,468
What the fuck do you mean, we?

1414
01:27:54,469 --> 01:27:55,929
I didn't fucking touch him!

1415
01:27:55,930 --> 01:27:57,889
Don't put that shit on me!

1416
01:27:57,890 --> 01:28:01,101
He beat us, man!
He deserved it!

1417
01:28:01,102 --> 01:28:03,939
You went too far, Mickey!
Oh, shit!

1418
01:28:04,148 --> 01:28:05,189
Is he dead?

1419
01:28:05,190 --> 01:28:07,359
Of course he's fucking dead!
He fell six stories!

1420
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:08,485
Jim, come on.

1421
01:28:08,486 --> 01:28:12,366
Come on! Will you come one?
Jim, don't make me leave you here!

1422
01:28:15,828 --> 01:28:17,581
Oh, shit.

1423
01:28:28,886 --> 01:28:30,054

Get off of me!
What are you doing?

1431
01:29:20,113 --> 01:29:21,406
Who is it?

1432
01:29:21,908 --> 01:29:24,619
Ma... let me in.

1433
01:29:26,997 --> 01:29:28,958
Ma, let me in!

1434
01:29:44,559 --> 01:29:46,353
Please, Ma.

1435
01:29:53,445 --> 01:29:56,198
Ma? Hey, Ma?

1436
01:29:57,116 --> 01:29:58,116
Are you in there, Ma?

1437
01:29:59,035 --> 01:30:00,577
Ma, is that you?

1438
01:30:00,578 --> 01:30:01,538
Yeah.

1439
01:30:01,539 --> 01:30:04,041
Ma? Ma?

1440
01:30:05,752 --> 01:30:07,377
- Are you there?
- Yeah.

1441
01:30:07,378 --> 01:30:08,839
Hi.

1442
01:30:11,258 --> 01:30:13,134
Hi, Ma.

1443
01:30:13,135 --> 01:30:16,348
Hi. Hi.

1444
01:30:17,891 --> 01:30:20,686
Listen, I need you to
help me out, all right?

1445
01:30:22,020 --> 01:30:23,606
I need you to
give me some money.

1446
01:30:24,607 --> 01:30:26,484
Okay?

1447
01:30:27,194 --> 01:30:29,862
I need you to give me,
like, five doll...

1448
01:30:29,863 --> 01:30:32,240
Like, $20, something like that

1449
01:30:32,241 --> 01:30:33,492
because I'm in some trouble.

1450
01:30:36,997 --> 01:30:38,456
Ma?

1451
01:30:38,457 --> 01:30:40,208
Do you hear me, Ma?

1452
01:30:40,209 --> 01:30:42,795
Yeah, I hear you.
I can't help you.

1453
01:30:42,796 --> 01:30:43,796
Okay, listen,

1454
01:30:43,797 --> 01:30:46,425
what you got to do is give me
some money, okay?

1455
01:30:46,884 --> 01:30:48,553
Jim, I can't do that.

1456
01:30:49,762 --> 01:30:50,804
Why not?

1457
01:30:50,805 --> 01:30:54,683
Mom, you know I'm not
going to do anything with it.

1458
01:30:54,684 --> 01:30:57,479
I just need to go out of town
for a little while

1459
01:30:57,480 --> 01:30:59,022
'cause I got into some trouble,

1460
01:30:59,023 --> 01:31:00,108
and I need some help.

1461
01:31:01,359 --> 01:31:03,571
Okay? So, you got to
give me some money, Mom.

1462
01:31:04,029 --> 01:31:05,613
Can you hold my hand?

1463
01:31:05,614 --> 01:31:07,908
Yeah, I'll hold your hand.

1464
01:31:07,909 --> 01:31:10,245
Mom, can you give me
some money, please?

1465
01:31:11,497 --> 01:31:13,497
Mom, can you give me
some money, please?

1466
01:31:13,498 --> 01:31:15,458
Stop fucking around!

1467
01:31:15,459 --> 01:31:16,626
I can't.

1468
01:31:16,627 --> 01:31:20,005
Mom, give me some
fucking money, please!

1469
01:31:20,006 --> 01:31:22,425
What are you doing?
I'm your son!

1470
01:31:22,426 --> 01:31:23,927
I don't have any.

1471
01:31:23,928 --> 01:31:26,221
Mom, don't fuck
around like this!

1472
01:31:26,222 --> 01:31:28,015
Give me some money!

1473
01:31:28,016 --> 01:31:29,560
Mom!

1474
01:31:31,270 --> 01:31:35,359
Come on! Let me in
the fucking door!

1475
01:31:37,861 --> 01:31:40,114
Oh, God.

1476
01:31:43,368 --> 01:31:46,288
Oh, fuck.

1477
01:31:50,168 --> 01:31:52,420
Let me in.

1478
01:31:53,547 --> 01:31:55,966
I need some money.

1479
01:31:56,591 --> 01:31:58,885
I need some money real bad.

1480
01:31:58,886 --> 01:32:00,512
Ohh...

1481
01:32:00,513 --> 01:32:04,602
Oh, God.

1482
01:32:05,436 --> 01:32:07,939
Someone's breaking
into my apartment.

1483
01:32:09,065 --> 01:32:10,816
They have a knife.

1484
01:32:10,817 --> 01:32:12,360
Oh!

1485
01:32:12,361 --> 01:32:14,530
Mom!

1486
01:32:17,742 --> 01:32:20,662
You don't understand, Mom.

1487
01:32:21,705 --> 01:32:25,376
You don't know what
you're fucking doing to me.

1488
01:32:27,087 --> 01:32:29,673
Mom, I'm in pain.

1489
01:32:30,591 --> 01:32:34,928
How could you do this
to your son, you bitch?

1490
01:32:34,929 --> 01:32:38,349
You fucking bitch!

1491
01:32:38,350 --> 01:32:39,810
Ah!

1492
01:32:50,406 --> 01:32:53,535
Oh, let me in!

1493
01:32:54,369 --> 01:32:59,334
I'll do anything!
I'll be a good boy!

1494
01:33:00,293 --> 01:33:02,837
I'll be a good boy, mom,

1495
01:33:02,838 --> 01:33:05,590
if you let me in.

1496
01:33:06,467 --> 01:33:07,927
Get off me!

1497
01:33:08,844 --> 01:33:10,263
Get off!

1498
01:33:11,014 --> 01:33:12,015
No!

1499
01:33:13,642 --> 01:33:14,642
No!

1500
01:33:15,978 --> 01:33:17,480
You fuckers!

1501
01:33:17,772 --> 01:33:20,066
You're not going to do this!
Fuck you!

1502
01:33:20,943 --> 01:33:23,403
Ma! Don't do this!

1503
01:33:24,155 --> 01:33:25,281
Ma!

1504
01:33:30,537 --> 01:33:31,956
Ma!

1505
01:33:37,462 --> 01:33:38,714
Ma!

1506
01:33:42,010 --> 01:33:44,220
I got six months
in Riker's Island

1507
01:33:44,762 --> 01:33:47,432
for assault, robbery,

1508
01:33:48,225 --> 01:33:51,062
resisting arrest,
and possession of narcotics.

1509
01:33:52,063 --> 01:33:54,106
I sweated out a horrible cure

1510
01:33:54,107 --> 01:33:56,233
and stayed clean
the whole stretch

1511
01:33:56,234 --> 01:33:58,862
even though it's been easier
to get good junk in here

1512
01:33:58,863 --> 01:34:00,782
than it is on the street.

1513
01:34:01,908 --> 01:34:03,534
Shit, it's been hard, man.

1514
01:34:03,535 --> 01:34:05,578
All I've been doing
is reading these diaries

1515
01:34:05,579 --> 01:34:07,749
and wondering how the hell
I'm still alive,

1516
01:34:08,583 --> 01:34:10,376
and even if I care.

1517
01:34:11,587 --> 01:34:13,087
Suffice to say that I'm finished

1518
01:34:13,088 --> 01:34:15,590
with the asshole bandits
of shower-room rape,

1519
01:34:15,591 --> 01:34:18,302
and suffice to say
that those swine guards

1520
01:34:18,303 --> 01:34:20,347
won't draw blood
from my ankles again.

1521
01:34:21,056 --> 01:34:23,767
Suffice to say that I've been
just thinking about dumb stuff

1522
01:34:24,810 --> 01:34:29,483
like what a nice concept it is to have
a godmother and a godfather,

1523
01:34:29,983 --> 01:34:32,820
wondering who
my godparents might be.

1524
01:34:34,530 --> 01:34:35,990
My mom won't visit me here,

1525
01:34:36,283 --> 01:34:39,494
so I guess I'll just have to wait
till I get home to ask.

1526
01:34:47,087 --> 01:34:48,380
Jim?

1527
01:34:49,256 --> 01:34:50,299
Who's there?

1528
01:34:53,594 --> 01:34:54,847
It's me.

1529
01:34:56,181 --> 01:34:57,682
Pedro?

1530
01:34:59,977 --> 01:35:01,563
What's up, man?

1531
01:35:02,189 --> 01:35:03,397
Nothing. You know.

1532
01:35:03,398 --> 01:35:05,942
I... I hear you come here.

1533
01:35:05,943 --> 01:35:07,277
I just came by to say hi.

1534
01:35:07,278 --> 01:35:08,696
I'm sorry about that night

1535
01:35:08,697 --> 01:35:11,031
at the candy store
and everything.

1536
01:35:11,032 --> 01:35:13,272
It's all right. Reform school
turned out to be real cool,

1537
01:35:13,827 --> 01:35:15,579
so don't sweat it.

1538
01:35:17,540 --> 01:35:19,165
Did you hear about Mickey,
that scumbag?

1539
01:35:19,166 --> 01:35:21,086
He went and threw
some chump off a roof.

1540
01:35:22,254 --> 01:35:24,381
He's getting 5 to 15 years, man.

1541
01:35:24,382 --> 01:35:26,550
They tried him like an adult.

1542
01:35:27,219 --> 01:35:29,304
Shit.

1543
01:35:30,180 --> 01:35:32,349
I got a present for you, Jim.

1544
01:35:34,435 --> 01:35:36,603
A bag of the finest dope

1545
01:35:36,604 --> 01:35:37,940
in Manhattan.

1546
01:35:39,107 --> 01:35:40,233
You know, me and you?

1547
01:35:40,942 --> 01:35:42,278
Like old times?

1548
01:35:45,907 --> 01:35:47,492
I can't.

1549
01:35:49,662 --> 01:35:51,247
Come on.
It would be dynamite.

1550
01:35:53,249 --> 01:35:54,751
I got this thing to do.

1551
01:35:55,919 --> 01:35:58,088
Why don't you come check it out?

1552
01:35:59,006 --> 01:36:01,134
No. I'm going to go,
then, you know?

1553
01:36:02,176 --> 01:36:03,720
You know how it is.

1554
01:36:05,889 --> 01:36:07,808
Take care of yourself,
little man.

1555
01:36:25,580 --> 01:36:27,123
Know this.

1556
01:36:28,166 --> 01:36:30,335
There's different types
of users of junk.

1557
01:36:31,211 --> 01:36:32,962
You got your rich
dilettante square-ass

1558
01:36:32,963 --> 01:36:34,465
who dabbles now and then

1559
01:36:35,342 --> 01:36:37,718
and always has enough money
to run off to the Riviera

1560
01:36:37,719 --> 01:36:40,347
if he feels he's fucking around
to the danger point.

1561
01:36:41,974 --> 01:36:44,644
Street junkies
hate these pricks,

1562
01:36:45,269 --> 01:36:48,273
but they're always suckers,
and their money makes them tolerable.

1563
01:36:49,817 --> 01:36:51,693
Then you got
your upper-middle-class

1564
01:36:51,694 --> 01:36:53,320
Westchester preppies...

1565
01:36:54,114 --> 01:36:55,865
same as the others, basically.

1566
01:36:56,658 --> 01:36:59,577
What they're good for is opening
their mommy and daddy's eyes

1567
01:36:59,578 --> 01:37:01,038
to this social virus

1568
01:37:01,039 --> 01:37:02,789
and putting pressure
on the government

1569
01:37:02,790 --> 01:37:04,668
to do something about it.

1570
01:37:07,087 --> 01:37:08,756
Then there's us street kids.

1571
01:37:09,424 --> 01:37:12,511
Start fucking around very young,

1572
01:37:14,012 --> 01:37:15,890
13 or so...

1573
01:37:17,933 --> 01:37:20,269
We think we all
got it under control

1574
01:37:20,270 --> 01:37:23,190
and won't get strung out.

1575
01:37:24,233 --> 01:37:26,194
This rarely works.

1576
01:37:27,320 --> 01:37:29,322
I'm living proof.

1577
01:37:30,908 --> 01:37:34,369
But in the end,
you just got to see the junk

1578
01:37:34,370 --> 01:37:36,080
as another 9-to-5 gig.

1579
01:37:38,500 --> 01:37:42,338
The hours are just a bit more
inclined to shadows.
