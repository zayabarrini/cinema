1
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:12,091
<i>You little brats, get lost!</i>

2
00:02:18,264 --> 00:02:19,098
Hey!

3
00:02:53,132 --> 00:02:55,134
It should have been me!

4
00:02:55,551 --> 00:03:01,515
I should be the one
going to that Jap's house.

5
00:03:02,975 --> 00:03:04,852
You'll miss the train.

6
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:07,188
<i>Hurry.</i>

7
00:03:15,196 --> 00:03:20,117
PART ONE

8
00:03:44,934 --> 00:03:47,311
KOUZUKI NORIAKI

9
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,528
<i>Go back to sleep.</i>

10
00:03:56,987 --> 00:03:58,781
<i>We're still far from the house.</i>

11
00:04:38,988 --> 00:04:41,365
<i>Pleased to meet you. I am Okju.</i>

12
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:43,242
<i>This property has three buildings.</i>

13
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:45,536
<i>A Western-style wing designed
by an English architect</i>

14
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:48,038
<i>and a Japanese wing form the main house.</i>

15
00:04:48,831 --> 00:04:52,042
Not even in Japan is there
a building combining the two styles.

16
00:04:53,711 --> 00:04:59,008
It reflects Master's admiration
for Japan and England.

17
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:02,177
Next is the annex

18
00:05:02,261 --> 00:05:04,722
which Master had furnished as a library.

19
00:05:05,097 --> 00:05:06,849
Last, the servants' quarters.

20
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:09,268
As the Lady's handmaiden,
you won't sleep there.

21
00:05:10,144 --> 00:05:12,313
You may eat her leftover food,

22
00:05:12,396 --> 00:05:14,773
but tea leaves go to the kitchen girls.

23
00:05:14,857 --> 00:05:17,067
Used soap and oil are for the steward.

24
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:20,070
Anyone caught stealing
is expelled that day.

25
00:05:20,154 --> 00:05:22,448
I'm sure you wouldn't dare, Tamako.

26
00:05:23,115 --> 00:05:28,620
"Tamako" is you, by the way.
It's your name Okju in Japanese.

27
00:05:28,704 --> 00:05:30,664
Everything in this household
is Japanese style.

28
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:35,002
Use only Japanese to Master and the Lady.

29
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:38,672
- Call me Sasaki.
- Yes, ma'am.

30
00:05:42,343 --> 00:05:45,763
I don't trust new handmaidens.

31
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:47,765
Even though they greet you politely,

32
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:51,018
they are always the first to take scrolls
and run away when there's a fire.

33
00:05:56,231 --> 00:06:02,237
<i>The Lady's routine is simple.
She takes walks or reads for Master.</i>

34
00:06:03,739 --> 00:06:07,409
Among the richest men,
Master is the greatest book lover.

35
00:06:07,493 --> 00:06:10,662
And among book lovers, he is the richest.

36
00:06:10,746 --> 00:06:13,707
<i>His ties to the colonial government
even let us use electricity.</i>

37
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:15,376
In such a home,

38
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,297
you should know what's expected
of a maid like you.

39
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:25,886
Don't be alarmed at the blackouts.

40
00:06:51,412 --> 00:06:52,704
I sleep in here?

41
00:06:54,415 --> 00:06:57,251
Miss Hideko wakes easily
on account of her nerves.

42
00:06:58,001 --> 00:06:59,795
- She's behind this door?
- Sh!

43
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:00,898
<i>Mother!</i>

44
00:08:05,903 --> 00:08:07,571
<i>Mother!</i>

45
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:09,656
<i>Mother!</i>

46
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:12,493
Miss!

47
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,953
Miss, are you alright?

48
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:17,206
<i>Junko! Is that you?</i>

49
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:21,543
Junko was kicked out, Miss.
I'm the new girl.

50
00:08:21,627 --> 00:08:24,046
You must have had a bad dream.

51
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:27,716
You see that big cherry tree?

52
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:32,012
My aunt went mad and hanged herself there.

53
00:08:33,514 --> 00:08:35,516
<i>Sometimes on moonless nights,</i>

54
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,392
<i>my aunt's ghost</i>

55
00:08:37,476 --> 00:08:40,812
<i>dangles from that branch.</i>

56
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:55,369
Here, drink up.

57
00:08:59,248 --> 00:09:04,419
<i>When babies cry,
my auntie feeds them a spoonful of sake.</i>

58
00:09:09,508 --> 00:09:13,053
<i>Sweet bird, sweet bird</i>

59
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:17,099
<i>My sweet bluebird</i>

60
00:09:20,978 --> 00:09:27,067
<i>What scent is this, that fills my nose?</i>

61
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:58,265
Those fuckers.

62
00:10:00,684 --> 00:10:01,768
<i>This is Tamako.</i>

63
00:10:02,436 --> 00:10:04,730
I am at your service, Miss.

64
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:21,121
A reference letter from Lady Minami,
my last mistress.

65
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:27,919
So is this place to your liking?

66
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:33,175
The sun scarcely ever shines here.

67
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:35,093
Uncle won't permit it.

68
00:10:36,178 --> 00:10:38,680
<i>Sunlight causes books to fade.</i>

69
00:10:39,765 --> 00:10:42,309
One could never grow fond
of such a dreary place.

70
00:10:47,898 --> 00:10:50,025
Not a good liar, are you?

71
00:10:52,027 --> 00:10:54,988
We look alike.

72
00:10:56,031 --> 00:10:57,574
Don't you think?

73
00:10:57,658 --> 00:10:59,618
I'll take my leave.

74
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:04,748
My late aunt

75
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,708
and Mrs. Sasaki

76
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:10,962
tried very hard to teach me
of a mother's love.

77
00:11:12,798 --> 00:11:14,007
But not really.

78
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:26,978
My head aches
before every reading practice.

79
00:11:30,107 --> 00:11:31,525
Would you read it to me?

80
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:33,735
Pardon?

81
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,996
Oh, how kind of her.

82
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:48,875
Lady Minami said
such nice things about me!

83
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:49,793
Is that so?

84
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:58,218
You're a Japanese lady,
why don't you speak Japanese?

85
00:11:58,719 --> 00:11:59,886
I'm sick of it.

86
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:02,472
The books he makes me read
are all Japanese.

87
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:06,101
So read that for me.

88
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:20,157
"Dear Miss Izumi Hideko,

89
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:25,579
Count Fujiwara said
you're looking for a maid.

90
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:27,706
Maids are like...

91
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:29,750
a spoon... no...

92
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,378
are like chopsticks..."

93
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:40,010
Is it a spoon?

94
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,271
I don't know how to read, Miss.

95
00:12:54,316 --> 00:12:56,526
Not at all? What about Korean?

96
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:24,137
This is your name. Can't you read it?

97
00:13:30,811 --> 00:13:32,896
Reading can be learned,

98
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:36,316
and I don't care if you curse or steal.

99
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,535
But don't ever lie to me. Understood?

100
00:13:48,537 --> 00:13:49,663
Yes, Miss.

101
00:13:54,835 --> 00:13:55,669
She's my mother.

102
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:00,841
She's beautiful, quite the charmer!

103
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:04,386
<i>And me? Am I "quite the charmer"?</i>

104
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,766
Everyone says
I can't compare to my mother.

105
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:16,314
Count Fujiwara said...

106
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,900
So you've met the Count?

107
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:20,277
Pardon?

108
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,028
No, I've never met him...

109
00:14:22,946 --> 00:14:25,782
My aunt! I heard it from my aunt.

110
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:28,159
She was his nanny.

111
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,871
What did the Count say about me?

112
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:34,416
He said your face...

113
00:14:35,876 --> 00:14:40,130
Every night in bed he thinks
of your assets... your face.

114
00:14:43,258 --> 00:14:45,343
Why in bed, I wonder?

115
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:50,849
What's with your foot?

116
00:14:57,564 --> 00:14:59,232
I've nowhere to go.

117
00:15:00,317 --> 00:15:03,361
I've just stayed in this house
since coming to Korea when I was 5.

118
00:15:05,697 --> 00:15:09,492
But in new shoes, even paths
I always take seem different.

119
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:11,620
The ones from here

120
00:15:12,621 --> 00:15:14,497
<i>up to here should fit you.</i>

121
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:21,129
Why don't you pick something prettier?
Like this one.

122
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:25,091
It's time for reading practice.

123
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:28,178
- I'll go alone.
- <i>Miss?</i>

124
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,971
But it's raining.

125
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:51,034
At noon, come knock on the door. Okay?

126
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:55,747
<i>See you at--</i>

127
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:34,911
This is...

128
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:20,391
My new handmaiden.

129
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:23,228
The snake, the snake!

130
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:31,444
<i>You mustn't pass that point.</i>

131
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,947
Be warned!

132
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:37,033
The snake marks the "bounds of knowledge".

133
00:18:52,257 --> 00:18:55,510
He has a habit of licking the pen
when he's thinking hard.

134
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:57,637
He's not a dirty person.

135
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:02,809
What kind of a handmaiden
uses the umbrella for herself?

136
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:03,726
Pardon?

137
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,104
<i>Miss.</i>

138
00:19:06,563 --> 00:19:07,730
<i>Miss!</i>

139
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:13,903
<i>Miss.</i>

140
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:22,120
<i>I don't have an upset stomach.
It's okay.</i>

141
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:26,791
<i>It's because the books are so boring.</i>

142
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:30,795
You must read a ton of books.

143
00:19:30,879 --> 00:19:33,047
You must be so knowledgeable.

144
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:45,018
I'm sorry about the prank.

145
00:19:45,894 --> 00:19:46,936
I won't do it again.

146
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:49,189
Forgive me.

147
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:13,880
The Count?

148
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:15,924
Today?

149
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:22,305
No wonder you insisted on a bath.

150
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:25,141
When my aunt heard
a guest was coming,

151
00:20:25,225 --> 00:20:27,852
she dropped everything
and bathed her Baby Miss.

152
00:20:28,645 --> 00:20:33,149
Nothing made her happier than
when guests praised the baby's scent.

153
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,403
You are my Baby Miss.

154
00:20:39,322 --> 00:20:41,866
Auntie gives babies candy during baths

155
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:44,035
<i>to teach them how sweet bath time is.</i>

156
00:20:45,036 --> 00:20:45,870
What's wrong?

157
00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:51,209
One of my teeth must be sharp.
It keeps cutting me.

158
00:21:36,963 --> 00:21:38,381
<i>So this was the scent.</i>

159
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:38,608
It's smooth now.

160
00:22:54,415 --> 00:22:55,583
Welcome, sir!

161
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:09,514
You are too kind to greet me
like this upon my arrival,

162
00:23:09,597 --> 00:23:12,850
when the journey has left me so unkempt.

163
00:23:12,934 --> 00:23:14,268
Now your tedium is over.

164
00:23:14,685 --> 00:23:19,065
I'll ensure your painting lessons
are stimulating.

165
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:23,486
This must be Okju.

166
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:25,905
At your service, milord.

167
00:23:27,115 --> 00:23:30,618
You know if you fail,
it'll put me in an awkward position?

168
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:36,332
A decent bone structure for a Korean...

169
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:40,545
So, are you carrying out
your duties faithfully?

170
00:23:40,628 --> 00:23:43,131
<i>Thank you for introducing her.</i>

171
00:23:43,214 --> 00:23:47,969
<i>You found the perfect maid for me.</i>

172
00:23:50,513 --> 00:23:54,016
It was tough looking for one
that wasn't chubby.

173
00:23:54,976 --> 00:23:58,187
Take care of the lonely lady.

174
00:23:59,647 --> 00:24:00,481
Here.

175
00:24:21,127 --> 00:24:24,046
Count Fujiwara asks Miss Hideko
to kindly allow her maid Tamako

176
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:27,717
to be sent to his Lordship
for a brief errand.

177
00:24:36,184 --> 00:24:38,644
Did you call for me, milord?

178
00:24:38,728 --> 00:24:39,562
<i>You may enter.</i>

179
00:25:19,477 --> 00:25:21,562
You tried to fool me with a fake coin.

180
00:25:21,646 --> 00:25:23,147
How dare you?

181
00:25:28,361 --> 00:25:32,823
<i>You think I'm Tamako,
a poor Korean handmaiden.</i>

182
00:25:33,366 --> 00:25:36,244
<i>But my real name is Nam Sookee.</i>

183
00:25:36,786 --> 00:25:42,917
<i>Raised by Miss Boksun,
top purveyor of stolen goods.</i>

184
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,255
<i>I was able to tell a real coin
from a fake when I was 5.</i>

185
00:25:47,338 --> 00:25:50,424
<i>Then learned to forge stamps from Gugai,</i>

186
00:25:50,508 --> 00:25:54,095
<i>and pickpocketing from Kutan,</i>

187
00:25:54,929 --> 00:25:58,224
<i>but these babies will never
learn such useful skills.</i>

188
00:25:59,016 --> 00:26:01,310
<i>Abandoned as newborns,</i>

189
00:26:01,394 --> 00:26:04,522
<i>we'll wash and feed them,
then sell them to Japan.</i>

190
00:26:04,981 --> 00:26:06,816
<i>What meaningful work.</i>

191
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:11,237
<i>Instead of starving, they grow up
to be rich gentlemen and ladies.</i>

192
00:26:12,321 --> 00:26:16,993
<i>Kutan only breastfeeds her own kid.
I wouldn't be so miserly.</i>

193
00:26:17,451 --> 00:26:22,415
<i>I wish my breasts gave milk.
I'd breastfeed all of them.</i>

194
00:26:31,882 --> 00:26:32,967
<i>Count!</i>

195
00:27:03,414 --> 00:27:06,459
I'll tell you the story of an interpreter,

196
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:12,548
who bribed his way
into translating for high officials.

197
00:27:13,341 --> 00:27:17,637
After helping Japan annex Korea,
he got rights to a gold mine.

198
00:27:18,429 --> 00:27:20,598
<i>Now he wants to turn fully Japanese.</i>

199
00:27:22,224 --> 00:27:24,644
So he gets naturalized,

200
00:27:25,436 --> 00:27:28,522
marries the daughter
of a fallen Japanese noble,

201
00:27:29,065 --> 00:27:32,401
and adopts his wife's family name Kouzuki.

202
00:27:33,653 --> 00:27:37,907
Ba... bas...

203
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:42,995
That bastard builds a mansion,
fills it with books and antiques.

204
00:27:44,955 --> 00:27:48,542
He invites Japanese collectors
to his library,

205
00:27:48,626 --> 00:27:52,672
<i>holds readings of rare books,
and auctions the books off.</i>

206
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:56,050
He loves books and paintings
like his own flesh,

207
00:27:56,133 --> 00:27:57,551
<i>but he can't help parting with a few.</i>

208
00:27:58,052 --> 00:28:01,555
What to do, when he must sell,
but can't bear to?

209
00:28:01,639 --> 00:28:03,099
He sells a fake.

210
00:28:06,394 --> 00:28:11,148
He seeks out a specialist
to create intricate forgeries.

211
00:28:11,899 --> 00:28:13,943
Unlike him, this specialist...

212
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:16,487
is a real Japanese of noble birth!

213
00:28:18,531 --> 00:28:21,450
Count Fujiwara from Nagoya.

214
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:26,247
<i>So, who is this?</i>

215
00:28:27,707 --> 00:28:30,167
It's the wife. His Japanese wife.

216
00:28:31,877 --> 00:28:34,547
- You'll seduce her--
- Is she pretty?

217
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:37,425
The Jap wife died ages ago
with no children.

218
00:28:38,092 --> 00:28:42,596
But the dead wife's
dead sister's living daughter

219
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,140
performs those book readings.

220
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:45,433
But is she pretty?

221
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,102
She's an orphan. Her father was rich.

222
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:52,481
Soon she'll fall in love with me,
and we'll elope to Japan.

223
00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:54,358
After marrying her there

224
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:59,405
and inheriting her fortune,
I'll declare her insane

225
00:28:59,488 --> 00:29:01,449
and lock her up in a madhouse.

226
00:29:01,532 --> 00:29:02,742
<i>Right!</i>

227
00:29:03,701 --> 00:29:06,996
<i>Sookee will be my mouse,
work as her maid,</i>

228
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:09,498
eavesdrop on her sleeptalking,

229
00:29:09,582 --> 00:29:11,083
and hand her over to me.

230
00:29:11,751 --> 00:29:16,672
Stay by her side during the day
and gently persuade her to fall in love.

231
00:29:17,339 --> 00:29:18,340
<i>Love?</i>

232
00:29:19,175 --> 00:29:20,801
<i>What does a crook know about love?</i>

233
00:29:26,849 --> 00:29:29,560
What about her fortune?
Is she rich for sure?

234
00:29:30,644 --> 00:29:34,315
<i>Every night in bed
I think of her assets.</i>

235
00:29:34,899 --> 00:29:37,610
<i>1.5 million in cash. 300,000 in bonds.</i>

236
00:29:40,988 --> 00:29:43,991
The uncle is just a guardian.
It's Hideko's fortune.

237
00:29:44,366 --> 00:29:47,787
That's why Kouzuki
schemes to marry the girl.

238
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:50,539
To his w... wife's niece?

239
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:52,333
What a s... sick f... f...

240
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:54,001
Right, a sick fuck.

241
00:29:55,836 --> 00:29:58,297
So what's our share?

242
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,425
I'll share 50,000.

243
00:30:01,509 --> 00:30:03,719
Sookee also gets
the dresses and jewellery.

244
00:30:04,553 --> 00:30:06,430
I'll do it! Take me!

245
00:30:06,514 --> 00:30:09,683
My Japanese is better,
and I've worked as a maid before!

246
00:30:23,447 --> 00:30:25,032
On top of the fifty,

247
00:30:27,284 --> 00:30:30,788
I get dresses, jewellery
and my own 100,000.

248
00:30:33,499 --> 00:30:36,794
B... b... beautiful!

249
00:30:36,877 --> 00:30:39,713
I... I... I'm utterly speechless
in your presence!

250
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:44,593
If you stutter like that
and make your face go red,

251
00:30:45,052 --> 00:30:47,263
those uppity bitches will feel superior,

252
00:30:47,346 --> 00:30:49,348
and then they'll open up to you,
all right?

253
00:30:49,431 --> 00:30:51,141
Now, how to make your face go red.

254
00:30:51,225 --> 00:30:53,727
Listen carefully. Breathe in,

255
00:30:53,811 --> 00:30:56,021
pull in your stomach,

256
00:30:56,105 --> 00:30:59,066
pull your chin down
and tighten your butthole,

257
00:30:59,149 --> 00:31:01,443
then hold your breath
and swallow your saliva ten times.

258
00:31:01,944 --> 00:31:02,778
Get it?

259
00:31:04,154 --> 00:31:05,114
Let's just try it.

260
00:31:19,879 --> 00:31:23,340
Would you like to wear a navy kimono
with white peonies

261
00:31:23,424 --> 00:31:25,843
or a black kimono with cranes?

262
00:31:27,469 --> 00:31:30,055
Would you like to wear
a caterpillar patterned poop color

263
00:31:30,139 --> 00:31:32,558
or a poop patterned caterpillar color?

264
00:31:32,641 --> 00:31:36,353
<i>Don't ask! If you ask a question,
she'll start to think.</i>

265
00:31:36,854 --> 00:31:39,356
You think, and she doesn't.

266
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,609
That's how you control the Miss.

267
00:31:41,692 --> 00:31:42,693
All right?

268
00:31:42,776 --> 00:31:43,611
All right.

269
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:50,451
Here's the letter. Pay attention.

270
00:31:53,871 --> 00:31:55,831
"Dear Miss Izumi Hideko,

271
00:31:55,915 --> 00:32:00,711
Count Fujiwara has informed me
of your urgent need for a maid.

272
00:32:01,295 --> 00:32:04,632
A maid is like a pair of chopsticks.

273
00:32:04,715 --> 00:32:09,011
Her presence is little noted, but
her absence causes much distress."

274
00:32:11,096 --> 00:32:14,808
<i>Did my mom cry before they hanged her?</i>

275
00:32:15,434 --> 00:32:17,603
<i>Women who stole once</i>

276
00:32:18,646 --> 00:32:21,899
and got hanged cried.

277
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:23,692
They cried a lot.

278
00:32:26,028 --> 00:32:29,990
Your mother stole a thousand times,

279
00:32:30,074 --> 00:32:33,702
was caught just once and died once.

280
00:32:35,663 --> 00:32:36,789
Did she cry?

281
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,753
She laughed.

282
00:32:43,754 --> 00:32:46,674
Said she was lucky
to have you before dying

283
00:32:46,757 --> 00:32:49,051
and that she had no regrets.

284
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:54,598
You will surely become a brave thief.

285
00:33:07,027 --> 00:33:08,988
It should have been me!

286
00:33:10,406 --> 00:33:16,495
I should be the one
going to that Jap's house.

287
00:33:27,423 --> 00:33:29,091
Everyone's talking about you in Eunpo,

288
00:33:29,842 --> 00:33:32,845
how you'll be an even greater thief
than your mother.

289
00:33:33,429 --> 00:33:35,556
Who believes the words of a swindler?

290
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:41,395
When I give the signal,
"fully ripe",

291
00:33:41,478 --> 00:33:43,522
arrange for her and me to be alone.

292
00:33:43,605 --> 00:33:45,607
Then I'll gobble her up to the pit.

293
00:33:45,691 --> 00:33:48,944
She's so naive
she wouldn't know what a man wants

294
00:33:49,028 --> 00:33:51,405
even if he pulled on her nipples.

295
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:54,616
<i>So it's your job to tell her</i>

296
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:57,870
<i>that everything is because of me.</i>

297
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:01,123
"Oh my, since the Count arrived,

298
00:34:01,206 --> 00:34:03,876
your toenails are growing much faster!"

299
00:34:05,085 --> 00:34:07,004
<i>That sort of thing, all right?</i>

300
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:09,506
Here, a gift.

301
00:34:21,769 --> 00:34:24,229
Oh, he's so thoughtful!

302
00:34:25,856 --> 00:34:28,567
<i>That'll be mine
when she goes to the madhouse.</i>

303
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:33,072
<i>It pains my heart to see this poor girl.</i>

304
00:34:33,155 --> 00:34:35,699
Have you ever seen sapphires so blue?

305
00:34:39,495 --> 00:34:41,121
Let's take a look...

306
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:46,877
This isn't a sapphire, it's blue spinel.

307
00:34:50,297 --> 00:34:52,674
It's all right, Miss.
Spinels are expensive too.

308
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:55,135
How do you know?

309
00:34:55,928 --> 00:35:00,099
Oh, my Auntie...
I mean, Lady Minami taught me.

310
00:35:01,016 --> 00:35:02,476
But it's fine!

311
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:04,144
There's no need to be ashamed at all.

312
00:35:04,228 --> 00:35:06,814
Your average fence
can barely tell them apart.

313
00:35:06,897 --> 00:35:07,856
Is that so?

314
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:25,290
<i>Of all the things
I've washed and dressed,</i>

315
00:35:26,125 --> 00:35:28,252
<i>has anything been this pretty?</i>

316
00:35:30,504 --> 00:35:32,798
<i>I'd like to show her
to the people at home.</i>

317
00:35:34,383 --> 00:35:35,676
<i>What would they say?</i>

318
00:35:38,178 --> 00:35:39,471
<i>Probably this?</i>

319
00:35:42,891 --> 00:35:44,059
Mesmerizing!

320
00:35:44,143 --> 00:35:47,813
S... spellbindingly beautiful!

321
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:55,779
<i>He's shameless.</i>

322
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:04,413
The Count kept offering me wine.

323
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:12,546
<i>Does it feel okay?</i>

324
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:16,758
It's suffocating.
How do ladies wear such things?

325
00:36:17,718 --> 00:36:19,219
You think this is suffocating?

326
00:36:20,804 --> 00:36:22,598
Miss, you're killing me!

327
00:36:26,476 --> 00:36:29,188
<i>Dressed up, you look like a lady too.</i>

328
00:36:33,984 --> 00:36:35,402
I think I know

329
00:36:37,237 --> 00:36:39,072
what the Count meant.

330
00:36:40,991 --> 00:36:42,242
Your face...

331
00:36:44,203 --> 00:36:45,662
Every night in bed,

332
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,665
I think of your face.

333
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:54,213
Don't be silly, Miss.

334
00:37:02,012 --> 00:37:04,389
<i>Ladies truly are the dolls of maids.</i>

335
00:37:05,766 --> 00:37:09,895
<i>All these buttons are for my amusement.</i>

336
00:37:11,063 --> 00:37:13,482
<i>If I undo the buttons
and pull out the cords,</i>

337
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:18,528
<i>then the sweet things within,</i>

338
00:37:19,196 --> 00:37:21,531
<i>those sweet and soft things...</i>

339
00:37:23,951 --> 00:37:28,413
<i>If I were still a pickpocket
I'd slip my hand inside...</i>

340
00:38:01,697 --> 00:38:05,367
Miss, are you truly going
to marry your uncle?

341
00:38:09,121 --> 00:38:13,125
That's what he raised me for,
knowing he'd need my fortune.

342
00:38:14,251 --> 00:38:16,420
<i>There's a famous collector in France.</i>

343
00:38:16,503 --> 00:38:19,798
He'll be putting his entire library up
for auction.

344
00:38:19,881 --> 00:38:22,592
<i>The gold mine's proceeds
won't cover the cost.</i>

345
00:38:25,345 --> 00:38:29,016
If it were me, I'd sell books to buy gold,
not the opposite.

346
00:38:31,184 --> 00:38:34,396
Have you ever thought of
marrying someone else?

347
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:36,189
<i>Like Count Fujiwara, for example--</i>

348
00:38:36,273 --> 00:38:39,568
You're very nosy for a handmaiden.

349
00:39:07,429 --> 00:39:08,889
<i>For now,</i>

350
00:39:09,306 --> 00:39:11,433
<i>the Lady needn't go read
to the sick fuck,</i>

351
00:39:11,516 --> 00:39:13,477
<i>who wants to marry his wife's niece.</i>

352
00:39:15,604 --> 00:39:19,941
<i>Instead the fake Count goes
to the Library to make fake books.</i>

353
00:39:23,945 --> 00:39:27,699
<i>The Lady waits for her
2 o'clock art class,</i>

354
00:39:27,783 --> 00:39:29,076
<i>and waits...</i>

355
00:39:31,453 --> 00:39:33,663
<i>Poor girl,</i>

356
00:39:33,747 --> 00:39:36,124
<i>losing her heart to a fake.</i>

357
00:40:10,784 --> 00:40:12,452
<i>Please, Count!</i>

358
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:07,174
Sorry to be late.

359
00:41:07,883 --> 00:41:09,217
It's fine.

360
00:41:17,434 --> 00:41:21,730
Maybe I need more practice
to give it dimensionality.

361
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:24,316
Dimensionality... perhaps.

362
00:41:24,399 --> 00:41:27,819
Nonetheless, you have a vision
that transcends mere skill.

363
00:41:28,403 --> 00:41:31,573
<i>It's as if you see directly
into an object's essence.</i>

364
00:41:32,574 --> 00:41:36,661
For example, the fact that this peach
contains a lot of water.

365
00:41:37,746 --> 00:41:40,207
I hesitate to stand before you,

366
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:42,375
for fear that you might read my thoughts.

367
00:41:57,557 --> 00:41:58,850
That's enough for today.

368
00:42:05,774 --> 00:42:07,317
Almost fully ripe.

369
00:42:08,568 --> 00:42:09,402
<i>Already?</i>

370
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:15,325
<i>Damn...</i>

371
00:42:19,412 --> 00:42:20,580
Do you know what?

372
00:42:20,664 --> 00:42:24,376
Since the Count arrived,
your cheeks have grown flushed.

373
00:42:24,459 --> 00:42:25,377
Have they?

374
00:42:31,925 --> 00:42:34,219
How did your mother die?

375
00:42:35,845 --> 00:42:40,767
When I was a baby,
at a big house, she was hanged...

376
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:44,813
- I mean, she hanged--
- Hanged herself like my aunt, huh?

377
00:42:45,605 --> 00:42:47,357
Well, pretty much.

378
00:42:55,073 --> 00:42:59,286
She must have often hugged you
when she was alive, right?

379
00:43:03,748 --> 00:43:07,669
My mother died giving birth to me.

380
00:43:09,045 --> 00:43:15,552
So it's as if I strangled her myself.

381
00:43:17,554 --> 00:43:20,181
I wish I'd never been born.

382
00:43:24,561 --> 00:43:26,980
No baby is ever guilty of being born.

383
00:43:28,148 --> 00:43:30,442
If your mother thought
you could understand

384
00:43:30,525 --> 00:43:32,777
this is what she'd have said.

385
00:43:33,903 --> 00:43:37,198
That she was so lucky
to have you before dying,

386
00:43:38,283 --> 00:43:39,868
that she had no regrets.

387
00:43:46,916 --> 00:43:48,627
Wait here a moment, Miss.

388
00:43:50,170 --> 00:43:51,421
I'll go pick mushrooms.

389
00:43:53,673 --> 00:43:56,551
We'll have mushroom stew tonight,
you like that.

390
00:43:56,635 --> 00:43:58,136
I'll go with you.

391
00:43:59,304 --> 00:44:00,555
I'll be quick.

392
00:44:01,514 --> 00:44:02,557
Before it rains.

393
00:44:12,192 --> 00:44:13,026
Good girl--

394
00:44:18,365 --> 00:44:20,367
<i>What a coincidence.</i>

395
00:44:20,867 --> 00:44:22,035
<i>Indeed.</i>

396
00:44:22,494 --> 00:44:23,745
<i>May I sit next to you?</i>

397
00:44:51,022 --> 00:44:53,775
<i>The lady sits, shy and trembling.</i>

398
00:44:53,858 --> 00:44:56,695
<i>The gentleman is persistent.</i>

399
00:44:57,487 --> 00:45:01,157
<i>The perceptive maid
has stepped out for a moment.</i>

400
00:45:02,409 --> 00:45:04,661
<i>All is well, Sookee.</i>

401
00:45:05,453 --> 00:45:08,456
<i>Everyone's performing
their roles so damned well.</i>

402
00:45:10,458 --> 00:45:11,292
<i>Damn.</i>

403
00:45:17,132 --> 00:45:19,300
You know servants can't use this entrance!

404
00:45:28,143 --> 00:45:28,977
Hey!

405
00:45:34,649 --> 00:45:37,360
<i>I wish I'd never come here.</i>

406
00:45:40,196 --> 00:45:42,073
<i>It was wrong to come.</i>

407
00:45:43,908 --> 00:45:46,745
Tamako, you brought watercolors, right?

408
00:45:47,746 --> 00:45:49,581
Of course, milord!

409
00:45:49,664 --> 00:45:51,082
Watercolor paints and brushes--

410
00:45:51,166 --> 00:45:53,251
Go and get the oils.

411
00:45:53,334 --> 00:45:56,838
A day like this demands oils!

412
00:46:19,736 --> 00:46:20,779
Shit!

413
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:27,327
Lady!

414
00:46:29,204 --> 00:46:30,747
Milord!

415
00:46:44,761 --> 00:46:45,762
Lady...

416
00:47:07,534 --> 00:47:10,119
<i>A blackout! Bring a lantern.</i>

417
00:47:28,763 --> 00:47:31,266
<i>I need to think.</i>

418
00:47:32,183 --> 00:47:34,102
<i>I need to become rich,</i>

419
00:47:34,477 --> 00:47:38,815
<i>sail off to a distant harbor,
eat food I scarcely recognize,</i>

420
00:47:38,898 --> 00:47:41,609
<i>buy my fill of glittering baubles,
and...</i>

421
00:47:42,277 --> 00:47:43,820
<i>not think of Hideko.</i>

422
00:47:45,405 --> 00:47:46,906
<i>Never think of Hideko--</i>

423
00:48:15,101 --> 00:48:17,145
<i>I returned
and you didn't even come to me.</i>

424
00:48:18,563 --> 00:48:21,149
It was late, I must have fallen asleep.
My apologies.

425
00:48:22,901 --> 00:48:25,737
You know how hard it is
to do those readings?

426
00:48:26,696 --> 00:48:29,699
Must I remove my makeup
and change all by myself?

427
00:48:30,909 --> 00:48:32,911
I feel a nightmare coming. Sleep here.

428
00:48:58,937 --> 00:49:00,563
He proposed to me.

429
00:49:04,108 --> 00:49:05,360
On the 15th,

430
00:49:06,945 --> 00:49:10,949
when my uncle visits his mine,
he wants to elope to Japan.

431
00:49:13,993 --> 00:49:15,662
What did you say?

432
00:49:18,665 --> 00:49:20,375
I said I wasn't sure.

433
00:49:20,458 --> 00:49:21,292
Why?

434
00:49:22,293 --> 00:49:23,127
I'm scared.

435
00:49:24,295 --> 00:49:25,546
Of your uncle's anger?

436
00:49:28,299 --> 00:49:29,133
Of the Count.

437
00:49:31,803 --> 00:49:34,389
What's to be scared of? He's so kind.

438
00:49:37,058 --> 00:49:39,018
I don't know, I just feel it.

439
00:49:43,272 --> 00:49:45,942
It's like the reflex of pulling
your hand back from a flame.

440
00:49:49,779 --> 00:49:50,905
Tell me...

441
00:49:59,664 --> 00:50:01,541
What is it that men want?

442
00:50:05,253 --> 00:50:06,087
Pardon?

443
00:50:07,463 --> 00:50:11,009
I mean after getting married, at night...

444
00:50:14,846 --> 00:50:17,724
How would I know?
I'm practically a child

445
00:50:17,807 --> 00:50:21,686
with no mother.
There's no one here to...

446
00:50:27,859 --> 00:50:28,735
First.

447
00:50:31,362 --> 00:50:32,905
I guess we'd kiss?

448
00:50:36,034 --> 00:50:36,868
And?

449
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:40,580
He would hold you in his arms.

450
00:50:41,414 --> 00:50:42,248
Standing?

451
00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:46,919
Only when there's nowhere to lie down
or you're in a hurry.

452
00:50:47,003 --> 00:50:49,881
Normally you do it on the bed.

453
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:52,592
You'll know when it happens.

454
00:50:52,675 --> 00:50:54,719
It's just like drinking
for the first time.

455
00:50:54,802 --> 00:50:55,970
When it happens?

456
00:50:59,807 --> 00:51:00,641
But...

457
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:04,479
Could someone be like a blind person,

458
00:51:05,229 --> 00:51:09,108
not being able to feel it?

459
00:51:10,902 --> 00:51:12,153
<i>What the hell.</i>

460
00:51:12,779 --> 00:51:14,697
<i>I'll show her one thing
then put her to bed.</i>

461
00:51:17,492 --> 00:51:18,493
<i>Poor thing,</i>

462
00:51:18,576 --> 00:51:25,124
<i>alone in a strange country,
reading those useless books,</i>

463
00:51:25,875 --> 00:51:28,419
<i>without learning a single useful skill.</i>

464
00:51:46,104 --> 00:51:48,231
<i>Why does the candy taste different?</i>

465
00:51:49,899 --> 00:51:53,111
<i>The bitterness turns sour,</i>

466
00:51:53,194 --> 00:51:56,114
<i>the sourness turns sweet,</i>

467
00:51:56,739 --> 00:52:00,201
<i>the sweetness turns savoury...</i>

468
00:52:00,284 --> 00:52:01,786
How do you know all this?

469
00:52:03,162 --> 00:52:04,997
Do you have experience?

470
00:52:07,667 --> 00:52:10,753
My friend Kutan taught me.

471
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:13,673
Taught you? With words?

472
00:52:13,756 --> 00:52:16,092
Yes, only with words.

473
00:52:35,486 --> 00:52:36,946
So this is how it feels.

474
00:52:37,488 --> 00:52:40,199
That's what you will feel for the Count.

475
00:52:41,284 --> 00:52:42,201
Really?

476
00:52:42,910 --> 00:52:44,579
The Count, truly...

477
00:52:47,665 --> 00:52:50,543
He won't think
he's making love to a corpse?

478
00:52:52,503 --> 00:52:54,839
You know about my cold hands and feet.

479
00:52:55,590 --> 00:52:56,674
Really?

480
00:52:57,425 --> 00:52:58,259
Here.

481
00:53:07,143 --> 00:53:08,853
It feels just fine.

482
00:53:09,395 --> 00:53:10,229
You like it?

483
00:53:12,273 --> 00:53:15,109
Do it to me. I want to know how it feels.

484
00:53:19,614 --> 00:53:23,826
I'm sure he'll want to do this too.

485
00:53:24,452 --> 00:53:25,536
And then...

486
00:53:32,585 --> 00:53:34,253
It's so cute.

487
00:53:36,881 --> 00:53:38,925
If the Count sees this...

488
00:53:49,352 --> 00:53:52,271
Will he really be as tender as this?

489
00:53:53,272 --> 00:53:54,440
Of course.

490
00:53:54,523 --> 00:53:57,360
He'll also touch you like this.

491
00:53:57,777 --> 00:53:58,611
<i>And like this...</i>

492
00:54:02,573 --> 00:54:04,867
Keep doing what the Count will.

493
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:11,123
And this is what he'll say.

494
00:54:13,709 --> 00:54:17,004
"It's so soft, warm,

495
00:54:18,798 --> 00:54:20,549
wet, and...

496
00:54:21,259 --> 00:54:25,304
s... s... spellbindingly beautiful!"

497
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:47,827
<i>Okju.</i>

498
00:54:49,412 --> 00:54:52,748
<i>Hideko.</i>

499
00:54:55,543 --> 00:54:57,920
<i>Mom.</i>

500
00:54:59,797 --> 00:55:02,008
<i>Dad.</i>

501
00:55:03,509 --> 00:55:06,137
Now, the model must stay still.

502
00:55:06,971 --> 00:55:10,683
<i>Okju.</i>

503
00:55:14,770 --> 00:55:18,399
<i>- Hideko...
- Wait.</i>

504
00:55:18,482 --> 00:55:19,900
<i>Stop!</i>

505
00:55:20,568 --> 00:55:24,196
<i>...doesn't like it,
you damned scoundrel!</i>

506
00:55:26,073 --> 00:55:27,158
<i>Stop it!</i>

507
00:55:27,241 --> 00:55:28,367
I can't do this.

508
00:55:32,496 --> 00:55:33,581
Come here, Tamako.

509
00:55:37,835 --> 00:55:39,420
Find something else to keep you busy.

510
00:55:39,503 --> 00:55:40,629
Do you know what I mean?

511
00:55:50,806 --> 00:55:52,767
I have nothing else to do.

512
00:55:52,850 --> 00:55:56,145
My job is to look after the Lady.

513
00:56:07,573 --> 00:56:10,659
I spit it out without chewing!
All because of you!

514
00:56:10,743 --> 00:56:12,745
She's fully ripe! Fully ripe!

515
00:56:12,828 --> 00:56:14,455
If I miss this chance, I'm finished!

516
00:56:15,915 --> 00:56:18,292
Can you feel it?
How much I want it?

517
00:56:18,376 --> 00:56:23,339
After fighting so hard
to escape my garbage heap of a life,

518
00:56:23,422 --> 00:56:26,926
you think I'll let you ruin it, you bitch?

519
00:56:27,009 --> 00:56:32,264
Shall I tell the Lady
you're nothing but a lowly pickpocket?

520
00:56:32,348 --> 00:56:35,768
Fine, I'll have something to tell her too.

521
00:56:35,851 --> 00:56:39,897
That you're nothing but the son
of a lowly Korean farmhand and shaman--

522
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:41,357
Sookee.

523
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:43,484
Think of your family at home.

524
00:56:43,901 --> 00:56:47,613
Boksun raising babies with her bad back
and those two idiots.

525
00:56:47,696 --> 00:56:50,032
How will they feel
if you go home empty-handed?

526
00:56:50,408 --> 00:56:51,909
Want to ruin your mother's reputation?

527
00:56:52,368 --> 00:56:54,328
You should go home in glory.

528
00:56:59,875 --> 00:57:03,504
So don't push Hideko too hard.

529
00:57:03,587 --> 00:57:04,964
She's got no one on this earth.

530
00:57:05,047 --> 00:57:08,134
If you frighten her,
she'll close up hard as a clam.

531
00:57:11,345 --> 00:57:12,721
And please...

532
00:57:14,265 --> 00:57:18,811
Don't ever again put my hand
on your tiny joke of a cock.

533
00:57:28,070 --> 00:57:28,904
Oh my.

534
00:57:29,947 --> 00:57:32,867
Your toenails have grown faster
since the Count arrived.

535
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:34,452
How curious.

536
00:57:35,911 --> 00:57:39,874
Miss, doesn't it bother you not to know?

537
00:57:40,958 --> 00:57:43,919
How many ships sail on the wide sea,

538
00:57:44,753 --> 00:57:47,047
people leaving, people returning,

539
00:57:47,590 --> 00:57:49,800
those saying farewell
or welcoming people back.

540
00:57:50,301 --> 00:57:52,344
Where is the farthest you've traveled?

541
00:57:52,803 --> 00:57:53,888
The hill beyond the manor?

542
00:58:00,895 --> 00:58:05,065
My uncle will chase me wherever I go.

543
00:58:07,568 --> 00:58:09,820
This is how I lived my life.

544
00:58:12,364 --> 00:58:16,243
I could be content here,
if you are with me.

545
00:58:21,582 --> 00:58:24,126
<i>You can walk with me in new shoes,</i>

546
00:58:24,752 --> 00:58:26,420
<i>tell me stories,</i>

547
00:58:28,589 --> 00:58:32,301
and massage my feet.

548
00:58:34,803 --> 00:58:36,555
You're fortunate, Miss.

549
00:58:37,139 --> 00:58:40,601
The man who loves you
has the power to protect you.

550
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:42,686
That's rare.

551
00:58:43,687 --> 00:58:47,775
But I'm not sure... if I love him.

552
00:58:49,109 --> 00:58:50,152
You do love him.

553
00:58:54,114 --> 00:58:55,491
How do you know?

554
00:58:57,284 --> 00:58:59,328
You stare out the window all day,

555
00:59:00,496 --> 00:59:02,581
turn in your sleep and sigh,

556
00:59:05,417 --> 00:59:06,752
and your toenails...

557
00:59:06,835 --> 00:59:08,546
What if I said I don't love him?

558
00:59:09,797 --> 00:59:12,675
What if I said that I love someone else?

559
00:59:14,176 --> 00:59:18,514
<i>I have no one on this earth...</i>

560
00:59:19,139 --> 00:59:21,308
Would you still want me to marry him?

561
00:59:25,396 --> 00:59:26,730
You will love him.

562
00:59:42,496 --> 00:59:43,706
<i>Miss!</i>

563
01:00:31,253 --> 01:00:32,129
<i>In the end,</i>

564
01:00:32,212 --> 01:00:36,050
<i>Hideko accepted the proposal,
provided that I go to Japan too.</i>

565
01:00:36,717 --> 01:00:38,594
<i>The Count, after feigning annoyance
for a bit,</i>

566
01:00:38,677 --> 01:00:40,846
<i>nodded his head.</i>

567
01:00:42,681 --> 01:00:44,808
<i>On the day her Uncle left
to visit his mine,</i>

568
01:00:44,892 --> 01:00:49,396
<i>the Count pretended to go back
to Japan and hid nearby.</i>

569
01:01:02,409 --> 01:01:04,912
You'll have a week of freedom,

570
01:01:05,996 --> 01:01:10,542
but always remember the basement.

571
01:01:56,630 --> 01:01:57,798
<i>Miss!</i>

572
01:02:58,984 --> 01:03:05,824
<i>Thank you for traveling
on our ferry today.</i>

573
01:03:05,908 --> 01:03:11,371
<i>We will arrive at Shimonoseki
at 7:30 p.m.--</i>

574
01:03:18,462 --> 01:03:19,797
We're finally going home.

575
01:03:20,464 --> 01:03:23,592
- It's been three years...
- It's been a long time.

576
01:03:29,181 --> 01:03:31,350
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry.

577
01:04:44,172 --> 01:04:46,174
To not steal...

578
01:04:46,758 --> 01:04:48,468
To not steal...

579
01:04:48,844 --> 01:04:50,345
To not commit adultery...

580
01:04:50,721 --> 01:04:52,389
To not commit adultery...

581
01:04:53,348 --> 01:04:55,309
To not lie...

582
01:04:55,392 --> 01:04:57,686
To not lie...

583
01:06:34,199 --> 01:06:39,079
<i>Spider thread pulled into strings</i>

584
01:06:39,705 --> 01:06:44,001
<i>Strumming makes a zither sing</i>

585
01:06:44,584 --> 01:06:47,421
<i>Thousand woes</i>

586
01:06:54,469 --> 01:07:01,309
<i>Under the blue sky
Only the crows cry</i>

587
01:07:02,060 --> 01:07:07,024
<i>How sorrowful my zither</i>

588
01:07:07,107 --> 01:07:10,694
<i>My beloved zither...</i>

589
01:07:21,163 --> 01:07:23,123
Did you sleep well?

590
01:07:33,467 --> 01:07:34,468
Excuse me.

591
01:07:35,135 --> 01:07:36,636
Sorry.

592
01:07:41,433 --> 01:07:46,813
<i>The Count paid the innkeeper
to spy on us, afraid we might run off.</i>

593
01:07:46,897 --> 01:07:49,900
Why get dressed?
I've nothing to do anyway.

594
01:07:52,277 --> 01:07:54,071
<i>Things are moving too slowly.</i>

595
01:07:54,154 --> 01:07:57,616
<i>I fear Hideko might truly go mad.</i>

596
01:07:58,408 --> 01:08:00,368
Shall we play "maid", like before?

597
01:08:04,039 --> 01:08:07,584
<i>There is no sign of the Count
from morning to night.</i>

598
01:08:08,335 --> 01:08:12,339
<i>Certifying the marriage
and converting the inheritance to cash</i>

599
01:08:12,422 --> 01:08:13,757
<i>require much work, he says.</i>

600
01:08:53,046 --> 01:08:54,881
How could you be so cruel?

601
01:08:54,965 --> 01:08:58,301
You plucked the flower, now re-plant it.

602
01:08:58,385 --> 01:08:59,845
What do you want?

603
01:09:00,512 --> 01:09:03,723
Hurry up and throw her into the madhouse!

604
01:09:38,216 --> 01:09:39,843
<i>After a week,</i>

605
01:09:50,228 --> 01:09:51,521
<i>finally...</i>

606
01:10:38,860 --> 01:10:39,694
This way.

607
01:10:46,493 --> 01:10:47,869
They're from the madhouse.

608
01:10:47,953 --> 01:10:49,162
You know what to say.

609
01:11:04,219 --> 01:11:05,595
Who is that person?

610
01:11:06,471 --> 01:11:08,139
The Countess Lady Fujiwara.

611
01:11:08,223 --> 01:11:10,976
Her maiden name was Izumi Hideko.

612
01:11:12,769 --> 01:11:14,646
And who might you be?

613
01:11:14,729 --> 01:11:16,439
I am the Lady's handmaiden.

614
01:11:16,856 --> 01:11:18,692
- What's your name?
- It's Tamako.

615
01:11:20,193 --> 01:11:22,904
Then, what kind of treatment

616
01:11:23,655 --> 01:11:26,324
do you believe your Lady requires?

617
01:11:40,755 --> 01:11:44,134
She should be confined in a place

618
01:11:44,217 --> 01:11:50,056
where no one can harm her
and where she can do no harm.

619
01:11:54,686 --> 01:11:59,524
Just a few tests, then let's have
lamb chops at the Peace Hotel.

620
01:12:16,041 --> 01:12:18,001
It's almost over. Good work.

621
01:12:20,211 --> 01:12:21,880
Don't be frightened.

622
01:12:57,499 --> 01:12:59,584
<i>Good day, Countess.</i>

623
01:13:00,335 --> 01:13:01,920
<i>Do you remember me?</i>

624
01:13:05,465 --> 01:13:06,299
Countess?

625
01:13:15,975 --> 01:13:17,352
What is this?

626
01:13:17,435 --> 01:13:20,355
We mean you no harm, Countess.

627
01:13:20,855 --> 01:13:22,440
<i>We're going to look after you.</i>

628
01:13:23,858 --> 01:13:27,529
You've got the wrong person.
She is the Countess.

629
01:13:28,446 --> 01:13:30,323
Tell them, Your Lordship!

630
01:13:31,991 --> 01:13:35,829
<i>She still believes
she's a Korean handmaiden.</i>

631
01:13:37,580 --> 01:13:41,042
It's because her nanny was Korean.

632
01:13:41,751 --> 01:13:42,919
You scoundrel!

633
01:13:44,879 --> 01:13:46,881
Let go of me, you filthy bitches!

634
01:13:46,965 --> 01:13:50,593
<i>We do not use such language here,
your Ladyship.</i>

635
01:13:50,677 --> 01:13:51,970
Miss!

636
01:13:56,474 --> 01:14:00,895
My poor Lady, she's gone nuts.

637
01:14:01,855 --> 01:14:04,190
If it would be of any help,

638
01:14:04,274 --> 01:14:08,987
this is from her mother
and she used to cherish it

639
01:14:10,488 --> 01:14:12,365
before going mad.

640
01:14:16,828 --> 01:14:19,122
Such a considerate maid.

641
01:14:21,624 --> 01:14:24,961
<i>You may have thought that
Hideko was a fool.</i>

642
01:14:26,087 --> 01:14:27,297
<i>A fool... maybe not.</i>

643
01:14:28,882 --> 01:14:32,594
<i>I tell you, right from the start
Miss Izumi Hideko...</i>

644
01:14:35,597 --> 01:14:37,474
<i>had always been...</i>

645
01:14:37,891 --> 01:14:38,975
Miss!

646
01:14:39,976 --> 01:14:41,728
<i>...a rotten bitch.</i>

647
01:14:47,108 --> 01:14:47,942
PART TWO

648
01:14:48,026 --> 01:14:53,573
I'm not a rotten bitch!
No! No!

649
01:15:00,538 --> 01:15:02,373
Put it in your mouth, Hideko.

650
01:15:05,752 --> 01:15:06,961
Hold out your hand.

651
01:15:26,064 --> 01:15:29,025
Next time you feel like talking back,

652
01:15:29,484 --> 01:15:32,779
remember the taste of this metal bead.

653
01:15:38,993 --> 01:15:41,746
You'll sleep alone from tonight.

654
01:15:52,257 --> 01:15:54,592
- All right?
- Please give me a light.

655
01:15:54,968 --> 01:15:58,179
We've been ordered to save oil.

656
01:15:58,763 --> 01:16:00,431
You little brat.

657
01:16:00,515 --> 01:16:01,933
Speak Japanese!

658
01:16:04,811 --> 01:16:08,565
In there is a man the size of an ogre

659
01:16:08,648 --> 01:16:12,777
who can't stand
the sound of girls screaming.

660
01:16:13,403 --> 01:16:16,948
If he hears you, he'll burst
in through that door after you.

661
01:16:18,199 --> 01:16:19,325
And then?

662
01:16:23,162 --> 01:16:27,417
He'll smother you with his giant body,

663
01:16:27,834 --> 01:16:30,169
so you can't make a sound.

664
01:16:44,517 --> 01:16:45,602
Aunt.

665
01:16:46,269 --> 01:16:47,979
My, my.

666
01:16:49,522 --> 01:16:52,233
Scaring a little girl like that.

667
01:17:42,241 --> 01:17:43,534
<i>And me?</i>

668
01:17:45,244 --> 01:17:46,871
Am I pretty too?

669
01:17:50,875 --> 01:17:52,293
Look closely.

670
01:17:57,423 --> 01:17:59,509
Everyone says I can't compare

671
01:18:00,009 --> 01:18:04,138
to my big sister.

672
01:18:06,849 --> 01:18:07,684
<i>Day.</i>

673
01:18:08,309 --> 01:18:09,143
<i>Night.</i>

674
01:18:09,727 --> 01:18:10,561
<i>Day.</i>

675
01:18:11,312 --> 01:18:12,146
<i>Night.</i>

676
01:18:13,189 --> 01:18:14,315
<i>Man.</i>

677
01:18:14,732 --> 01:18:15,775
Woman.

678
01:18:16,609 --> 01:18:17,777
Man.

679
01:18:18,444 --> 01:18:19,362
Woman.

680
01:18:22,740 --> 01:18:23,574
Eye.

681
01:18:24,242 --> 01:18:25,243
Nose.

682
01:18:26,077 --> 01:18:27,161
Mouth.

683
01:18:27,912 --> 01:18:28,788
Ear.

684
01:18:29,872 --> 01:18:30,790
Shoulder.

685
01:18:31,624 --> 01:18:32,667
Nipple.

686
01:18:33,209 --> 01:18:34,210
Navel.

687
01:18:35,002 --> 01:18:35,837
Eye.

688
01:18:36,295 --> 01:18:37,422
Nose.

689
01:18:37,922 --> 01:18:38,965
Mouth.

690
01:18:39,632 --> 01:18:40,633
Ear.

691
01:18:41,050 --> 01:18:42,552
Shoulder.

692
01:18:42,635 --> 01:18:43,678
Nipple.

693
01:18:44,262 --> 01:18:45,304
Navel.

694
01:18:48,641 --> 01:18:49,892
Penis.

695
01:18:50,351 --> 01:18:51,644
<i>Vagina.</i>

696
01:18:57,567 --> 01:18:59,777
<i>P... penis.</i>

697
01:19:00,361 --> 01:19:01,654
Vagina.

698
01:19:38,024 --> 01:19:41,235
Do you think I won't understand
if you speak Korean?

699
01:19:44,197 --> 01:19:48,743
<i>I was going a bit crazy and wanted
everyone else to go crazy too.</i>

700
01:19:53,289 --> 01:19:56,501
<i>When Mrs. Sasaki
looked as crazy as I,</i>

701
01:19:56,584 --> 01:19:58,836
<i>life was more bearable.</i>

702
01:20:17,230 --> 01:20:20,983
I know you are a bit insane.

703
01:20:21,776 --> 01:20:25,029
It runs in your mother's family.

704
01:20:26,072 --> 01:20:28,533
That's why I'm training you,

705
01:20:28,616 --> 01:20:29,826
to set your mind right.

706
01:20:30,326 --> 01:20:35,164
If I fail, there's a place called
a "mental hospital" in Japan.

707
01:20:39,001 --> 01:20:41,712
Established by rational Germans,

708
01:20:41,796 --> 01:20:45,633
it's very effective in treating lunacy.

709
01:20:46,175 --> 01:20:49,929
They dig holes in the dirt,
put a patient in each one,

710
01:20:50,012 --> 01:20:51,430
and put lids on top.

711
01:20:51,514 --> 01:20:54,058
When the patients get better,
they get a leash,

712
01:20:54,141 --> 01:20:57,979
so they can crawl around like dogs.

713
01:21:25,381 --> 01:21:29,176
<i>The cherry tree that came with me
on the ship from Japan</i>

714
01:21:29,260 --> 01:21:30,928
<i>bloomed twice.</i>

715
01:21:32,597 --> 01:21:35,725
"When Jinlian finally took off
her clothes,

716
01:21:35,808 --> 01:21:39,020
Ximen-Qing-examined her-Jade-Gate...

717
01:21:39,103 --> 01:21:42,857
To-find-it-hairless-as-white-as-snow
and-as-smooth-as-jade..."

718
01:21:45,526 --> 01:21:47,445
You must pause between words.

719
01:21:48,654 --> 01:21:51,574
Don't read like a dog lapping
at his plate!

720
01:21:54,035 --> 01:21:56,871
Listen to your aunt read.

721
01:22:04,003 --> 01:22:08,674
"When Jinlian finally took off
her clothes,

722
01:22:08,758 --> 01:22:12,553
Ximen Qing examined her Jade Gate...

723
01:22:12,637 --> 01:22:14,055
DISCOVERING THE SECRET WELL

724
01:22:14,138 --> 01:22:18,225
...to find it hairless, as white as snow,

725
01:22:18,643 --> 01:22:20,770
and as smooth as jade.

726
01:22:21,228 --> 01:22:23,564
As tight as a drum,

727
01:22:24,065 --> 01:22:25,983
and as soft as silk.

728
01:22:27,151 --> 01:22:31,739
Once he drew apart the curtains of flesh,

729
01:22:33,157 --> 01:22:38,579
a scent of well-aged wine
emanated from within,

730
01:22:40,122 --> 01:22:45,169
and on fold upon fold
of the red velvet interior

731
01:22:45,586 --> 01:22:47,296
beads of dew were forming.

732
01:22:48,547 --> 01:22:53,761
Its center was dark and void,

733
01:22:54,428 --> 01:22:57,640
yet as if it had its own life,

734
01:22:58,224 --> 01:23:02,269
it twitched and twitched."

735
01:23:30,756 --> 01:23:34,969
<i>Everyone wanted to cut it down,
but my uncle refused.</i>

736
01:23:36,846 --> 01:23:41,517
<i>He said this tree from Mt. Fuji
had absorbed my aunt's soul.</i>

737
01:23:42,518 --> 01:23:48,107
<i>The servants whispered it was
due to the tree's high cost,</i>

738
01:23:48,190 --> 01:23:50,943
<i>but I think my uncle was right.</i>

739
01:23:51,694 --> 01:23:54,155
<i>You can tell from the cherry blossoms,</i>

740
01:23:54,613 --> 01:23:57,616
<i>which turned brighter
and bloomed longer.</i>

741
01:24:31,108 --> 01:24:33,319
<i>"Tell me, Juliette.</i>

742
01:24:33,694 --> 01:24:37,156
Do you wish for
this impetuous young knight to save you?

743
01:24:38,532 --> 01:24:40,701
<i>The duchess shook her head resolutely,</i>

744
01:24:46,373 --> 01:24:53,380
to my great disappointment.

745
01:24:55,883 --> 01:24:56,926
Now,

746
01:24:57,968 --> 01:25:00,054
my brave knight."

747
01:25:05,101 --> 01:25:07,144
<i>Oh, it's a new face!</i>

748
01:25:10,648 --> 01:25:11,982
<i>Now,</i>

749
01:25:12,066 --> 01:25:13,943
<i>my brave knight.</i>

750
01:25:15,528 --> 01:25:21,992
<i>When you see these old scars
and the fresh pink wounds,</i>

751
01:25:22,076 --> 01:25:23,786
<i>what do you feel?</i>

752
01:25:27,331 --> 01:25:29,834
I pity the poor woman.

753
01:25:29,917 --> 01:25:34,922
I wish to lick her and lick her,
caress her and caress her.

754
01:25:36,090 --> 01:25:38,300
If you pity her so,

755
01:25:39,135 --> 01:25:43,389
why not take her place
and let her whip you?

756
01:25:50,437 --> 01:25:54,400
<i>The duchess raised the whip
high in the air, and then...</i>

757
01:26:02,449 --> 01:26:04,243
And again...

758
01:26:11,750 --> 01:26:14,879
<i>My cock became painfully erect.</i>

759
01:26:20,801 --> 01:26:24,805
If she could be yours for ten minutes,

760
01:26:24,889 --> 01:26:26,724
what would you give in exchange?

761
01:26:27,641 --> 01:26:30,728
Whatever your heart desires.

762
01:26:31,228 --> 01:26:33,981
Anything in this whole wide world.

763
01:26:35,691 --> 01:26:39,236
<i>Once the duke untied me,</i>

764
01:26:39,320 --> 01:26:42,823
<i>I sat on the chair, pulled her to me,</i>

765
01:26:43,616 --> 01:26:47,745
and slid my cock into her cunt.

766
01:26:53,417 --> 01:26:56,420
<i>Oh, Juliette, Juliette...</i>

767
01:26:58,756 --> 01:27:03,594
<i>As I felt the duke approach from behind,</i>

768
01:27:03,677 --> 01:27:06,388
<i>a rope slithered around my neck.</i>

769
01:27:07,932 --> 01:27:10,684
<i>The duke slowly tightened the rope.</i>

770
01:27:11,101 --> 01:27:15,814
<i>Like a drowning man grasping at straws,</i>

771
01:27:15,898 --> 01:27:20,319
<i>I pulled the swirling currents
of her hair.</i>

772
01:27:21,487 --> 01:27:23,822
<i>Then the duke spoke.</i>

773
01:27:26,367 --> 01:27:28,953
<i>The ten minutes are almost up.</i>

774
01:27:39,129 --> 01:27:41,257
Slowly, my dear, said the Duchess...

775
01:27:41,715 --> 01:27:48,472
I haven't yet fully savored his pain.

776
01:27:54,436 --> 01:27:57,982
No, the knight cried, don't stop!

777
01:28:00,109 --> 01:28:03,362
Please let me die

778
01:28:03,445 --> 01:28:05,614
in the midst of this pain.

779
01:28:06,073 --> 01:28:08,534
In this suffocating pain.

780
01:28:52,161 --> 01:28:53,579
Is it Sade?

781
01:28:54,413 --> 01:28:56,081
It's Sade-esque.

782
01:28:56,623 --> 01:29:01,670
It is believed to be the same Japanese man
who wrote <i>The Lizard Skin.</i>

783
01:29:02,463 --> 01:29:07,051
It was acquired from a Japanese sailor
on a ship from Hamburg.

784
01:29:17,102 --> 01:29:20,397
Cheap hair and shabby clothes,

785
01:29:21,065 --> 01:29:23,484
old and worn down,

786
01:29:23,567 --> 01:29:26,987
a body foul with food waste
and human secretion.

787
01:29:28,906 --> 01:29:33,410
Can you imagine my joy when

788
01:29:34,703 --> 01:29:38,082
after such a journey,

789
01:29:38,582 --> 01:29:42,961
it sat on my shelf with its brothers?

790
01:29:43,045 --> 01:29:44,380
Even compared with an unopened

791
01:29:44,463 --> 01:29:47,674
first-edition of Milton's,
it wouldn't be outstripped.

792
01:29:49,593 --> 01:29:50,427
That's right.

793
01:29:51,178 --> 01:29:56,016
These are the babes
to whom I feel the most affection.

794
01:29:57,309 --> 01:30:03,273
It used to contain an elaborate
monochrome woodcut illustration,

795
01:30:05,567 --> 01:30:07,027
but as you can see...

796
01:30:07,111 --> 01:30:08,445
<i>So unfortunate.</i>

797
01:30:10,614 --> 01:30:14,785
If that were intact,
you could've named your price.

798
01:30:16,537 --> 01:30:20,916
The author felt words alone
could not fully describe the positions,

799
01:30:20,999 --> 01:30:24,711
and so included an illustration.

800
01:30:26,088 --> 01:30:29,341
In that regard,
before we start the bidding...

801
01:30:30,259 --> 01:30:31,135
Hideko!

802
01:30:31,635 --> 01:30:33,720
Why don't you show us this scene?

803
01:31:12,134 --> 01:31:15,137
PAIN IS A GARMENT

804
01:32:37,636 --> 01:32:39,012
<i>Beautiful!</i>

805
01:32:45,644 --> 01:32:47,771
See you again.

806
01:32:48,272 --> 01:32:50,524
Yes, thank you.

807
01:32:50,607 --> 01:32:53,443
Today's reading was outstanding.

808
01:32:54,111 --> 01:32:55,529
Yes, thank you.

809
01:32:56,238 --> 01:32:58,907
Especially the puppet!

810
01:33:27,185 --> 01:33:29,104
<i>You are of noble birth,</i>

811
01:33:29,187 --> 01:33:33,942
<i>yet you engage in the lowly work
of copying paintings.</i>

812
01:33:34,026 --> 01:33:37,279
There was a time

813
01:33:37,362 --> 01:33:40,365
when I dissipated my wit and skills
on gambling.

814
01:33:40,866 --> 01:33:44,328
Imagine the torment
of having so many women

815
01:33:44,411 --> 01:33:46,121
make advances on me,

816
01:33:46,204 --> 01:33:48,915
when I couldn't afford
to buy them a glass of Burgundy.

817
01:33:50,667 --> 01:33:54,671
Do the women here make advances on you?

818
01:33:55,505 --> 01:33:57,424
I look at women's eyes,

819
01:33:57,507 --> 01:33:58,675
only the eyes.

820
01:33:59,509 --> 01:34:03,138
<i>They turn their gaze away,</i>

821
01:34:03,221 --> 01:34:05,724
<i>but then they always look back.</i>

822
01:34:06,099 --> 01:34:08,935
It's a silent exchange
of question and answer.

823
01:34:09,895 --> 01:34:14,858
If I were to slide
under someone's covers tonight,

824
01:34:14,941 --> 01:34:19,363
only one woman here would refuse me.

825
01:34:20,489 --> 01:34:22,240
<i>Does that include Mrs. Sasaki?</i>

826
01:34:23,325 --> 01:34:29,414
Is she not your former wife?

827
01:34:29,915 --> 01:34:32,751
You left her to marry a Japanese woman.

828
01:34:33,251 --> 01:34:36,755
But the servants tell me
you still share a bed with her.

829
01:34:39,257 --> 01:34:41,802
Can I ask you something?

830
01:34:44,971 --> 01:34:46,139
<i>Of course.</i>

831
01:34:47,557 --> 01:34:52,229
You went so far as to abandon your wife,
why this urge to become Japanese?

832
01:34:54,856 --> 01:34:56,566
Because Korea is ugly

833
01:34:57,025 --> 01:34:59,861
and Japan is beautiful.

834
01:35:01,029 --> 01:35:04,199
Some Japanese say Japan is ugly,

835
01:35:04,282 --> 01:35:05,784
and Korea is beautiful.

836
01:35:06,368 --> 01:35:08,787
Beauty is cruel by nature.

837
01:35:08,870 --> 01:35:12,874
Korea is soft, slow, dull,
and therefore hopeless.

838
01:35:14,209 --> 01:35:18,630
Let's talk about that one woman
who would deny you.

839
01:35:22,008 --> 01:35:25,929
Does it include Mrs. Sasaki?

840
01:35:26,012 --> 01:35:28,014
Mrs. Sasaki...

841
01:35:30,308 --> 01:35:31,893
If I gave her the right signal,

842
01:35:31,977 --> 01:35:36,356
<i>she'd knock on my door
without her underwear.</i>

843
01:35:44,030 --> 01:35:46,116
My thoughts exactly.

844
01:35:48,285 --> 01:35:49,661
Then who is it?

845
01:35:50,245 --> 01:35:52,414
The one who would deny you?

846
01:35:54,916 --> 01:35:57,836
I heard you own the highest quality

847
01:35:57,919 --> 01:36:01,548
antique bookmaking tools
of the East and West,

848
01:36:02,382 --> 01:36:03,717
but I don't see them here.

849
01:36:04,092 --> 01:36:06,344
I'll show them to you later.

850
01:36:07,804 --> 01:36:13,643
Who is the one person to refuse you?

851
01:36:16,313 --> 01:36:21,026
I met Hideko's eyes by chance,
but she didn't look away.

852
01:36:21,109 --> 01:36:24,404
Indeed it was I, who shifted my gaze.

853
01:36:24,488 --> 01:36:25,572
<i>Hideko,</i>

854
01:36:26,198 --> 01:36:31,912
Will she make an appearance
in your lewd dreams tonight?

855
01:36:33,747 --> 01:36:36,833
<i>Even if honored with such a visit,</i>

856
01:36:37,417 --> 01:36:39,795
<i>I don't think I could consummate.</i>

857
01:36:40,337 --> 01:36:44,257
I would happily regret it
the moment I begin

858
01:36:44,758 --> 01:36:48,053
because her body
would be as cold as a waterfowl.

859
01:36:53,350 --> 01:36:55,685
That is the result of long training.

860
01:36:57,479 --> 01:37:00,816
<i>I heard you are engaged to her.</i>

861
01:37:04,986 --> 01:37:10,617
<i>If I'm not mistaken,
you are yet to have intercourse?</i>

862
01:37:11,743 --> 01:37:14,454
<i>Her eyes have no desire.</i>

863
01:37:14,871 --> 01:37:17,415
<i>It means her soul is dead inside.</i>

864
01:37:19,376 --> 01:37:21,127
<i>You should go easy on her training,</i>

865
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:25,298
<i>unless you enjoy making love
to a corpse.</i>

866
01:37:48,822 --> 01:37:50,282
Would you like a smoke?

867
01:37:58,957 --> 01:38:02,794
How did such a noble count

868
01:38:02,878 --> 01:38:07,048
fall into the grouty habit
of smoking cigarettes?

869
01:39:00,644 --> 01:39:04,272
This is my particular way
of possessing beauty.

870
01:39:05,899 --> 01:39:09,402
Hideko too must have received
painting lessons.

871
01:39:10,445 --> 01:39:12,113
No, she did not.

872
01:39:12,739 --> 01:39:17,035
I was too occupied teaching her
to read with correct diction.

873
01:39:18,286 --> 01:39:19,287
<i>Is that so?</i>

874
01:39:19,788 --> 01:39:21,957
In England, where I studied,

875
01:39:22,040 --> 01:39:28,088
all ladies were expected to produce
vibrant color and graceful lines,

876
01:39:29,255 --> 01:39:31,299
even in the less noble families.

877
01:39:50,402 --> 01:39:52,529
You have a phone call, sir.

878
01:39:53,405 --> 01:39:55,198
At this hour?

879
01:39:55,281 --> 01:39:56,950
<i>It's the Iwamura Bookstore.</i>

880
01:39:57,951 --> 01:39:59,285
Is that so?

881
01:39:59,369 --> 01:40:01,329
Excuse me a moment.

882
01:40:11,381 --> 01:40:12,924
You are mesmerizing.

883
01:40:14,843 --> 01:40:17,637
Men use the word "mesmerizing"

884
01:40:17,721 --> 01:40:20,682
when they wish to touch a lady's breasts.

885
01:40:21,641 --> 01:40:25,228
I'm familiar
with Western conversational etiquette.

886
01:40:27,439 --> 01:40:30,275
I do a bit of reading, you know.

887
01:40:30,984 --> 01:40:32,902
There was no calculation in what I said.

888
01:40:33,486 --> 01:40:37,907
It was a reflex,
like pulling one's hand from a flame.

889
01:40:39,325 --> 01:40:40,368
I'm no flame.

890
01:40:41,119 --> 01:40:44,622
I'm cold as a waterfowl, your Lordship.

891
01:40:50,503 --> 01:40:52,672
He will return soon.

892
01:40:52,756 --> 01:40:55,341
Mr. Iwamura only called
with a frivolous inquiry,

893
01:40:55,425 --> 01:40:57,469
at my request.

894
01:40:57,552 --> 01:41:01,181
There's an issue regarding
your future you should know.

895
01:41:01,264 --> 01:41:04,476
I'll wait by the stone lamp at midnight.

896
01:41:06,269 --> 01:41:09,397
<i>That Iwamura is a real fool.</i>

897
01:41:15,570 --> 01:41:17,405
Good night, Miss.

898
01:42:28,810 --> 01:42:30,937
My maid is asleep in the room next door.

899
01:42:31,020 --> 01:42:33,314
I don't fancy being
in scandalous rumors with you.

900
01:42:33,398 --> 01:42:36,943
<i>I saw Junko go to the servants' quarters
with her pillow.</i>

901
01:42:37,026 --> 01:42:39,154
Consider your reputation as a nobleman.

902
01:42:39,779 --> 01:42:41,573
<i>I'm no nobleman.</i>

903
01:42:41,656 --> 01:42:43,449
<i>I'm not even Japanese.</i>

904
01:42:43,533 --> 01:42:46,119
<i>Do you think it was easy for
a Korean farmhand's son to reach here?</i>

905
01:42:47,245 --> 01:42:50,748
After fifteen hard years in Japan,
I heard some things about you.

906
01:42:51,249 --> 01:42:53,126
Another three years were spent to prepare.

907
01:42:53,793 --> 01:42:56,671
I studied bookmaking
and learned to paint forgeries.

908
01:42:57,505 --> 01:42:59,549
All so that I could meet you.

909
01:42:59,924 --> 01:43:01,467
To seduce and marry you,

910
01:43:01,551 --> 01:43:04,053
to possess your father's inheritance,

911
01:43:04,679 --> 01:43:06,306
and then probably to get rid of you.

912
01:43:08,433 --> 01:43:09,934
But I knew as soon as I met you.

913
01:43:10,518 --> 01:43:12,353
For a man to seduce you would be--

914
01:43:14,898 --> 01:43:15,982
...impossible.

915
01:43:17,775 --> 01:43:21,112
So in place of seduction,
I decided to propose a deal.

916
01:43:22,530 --> 01:43:26,075
Most marriages are like being imprisoned,
but this one will free you.

917
01:43:26,910 --> 01:43:28,745
I'll rescue you from here,

918
01:43:28,828 --> 01:43:32,290
take you far away, and give you freedom.

919
01:43:33,791 --> 01:43:35,960
Of course, we'll split the money.

920
01:43:37,170 --> 01:43:38,546
Nonsense.

921
01:43:39,589 --> 01:43:42,508
Does marrying an old man
with a black tongue

922
01:43:42,926 --> 01:43:44,052
at your tender age makes sense?

923
01:43:44,135 --> 01:43:46,262
I won't marry anyone.

924
01:43:46,346 --> 01:43:47,680
What have you in mind?

925
01:43:53,645 --> 01:43:55,104
That's not proper.

926
01:43:55,647 --> 01:43:56,814
There's no beauty in that.

927
01:43:57,440 --> 01:43:59,692
If you kill yourself,
what of your fortune?

928
01:44:00,443 --> 01:44:04,614
That will be the sum of your efforts?
Your fortune going to that pervert?

929
01:44:05,281 --> 01:44:08,576
So he can buy 10 little girls
and teach them to read books?

930
01:44:10,662 --> 01:44:12,872
My uncle will find us somehow.

931
01:44:13,289 --> 01:44:14,707
Then he'll take us to the basement.

932
01:44:15,833 --> 01:44:16,918
Uncle.

933
01:44:18,044 --> 01:44:18,962
The basement?

934
01:44:19,045 --> 01:44:22,340
<i>It says here when people are hanged,</i>

935
01:44:22,423 --> 01:44:27,178
their tongues stick out
and faeces is expelled.

936
01:44:28,304 --> 01:44:32,350
But that day, aunt's mouth was shut

937
01:44:33,142 --> 01:44:35,061
and her bottom was clean.

938
01:44:36,604 --> 01:44:38,690
Do you want to go somewhere nice?

939
01:44:56,457 --> 01:45:00,295
I'll tell you in detail
what I did to your aunt

940
01:45:00,378 --> 01:45:02,130
after I caught her running away.

941
01:45:02,755 --> 01:45:07,302
So don't you ever think of running,
understood?

942
01:45:25,403 --> 01:45:26,946
That day I just watched and listened.

943
01:45:27,697 --> 01:45:31,200
But if I ever end up there again...

944
01:45:35,997 --> 01:45:37,332
This is highly concentrated opium.

945
01:45:37,832 --> 01:45:39,667
Three drops will make you sleep all day.

946
01:45:40,084 --> 01:45:42,587
Five drops will knock down a horse.

947
01:45:43,129 --> 01:45:44,881
If you crave death within five minutes,

948
01:45:45,840 --> 01:45:47,675
drink it all.

949
01:45:47,759 --> 01:45:51,095
If you carry this,
he can never take you to the basement.

950
01:45:51,179 --> 01:45:52,263
At least not alive.

951
01:45:53,431 --> 01:45:55,016
It'll be my wedding gift to you.

952
01:45:55,683 --> 01:45:57,393
It's more expensive than jewels.

953
01:46:09,072 --> 01:46:14,035
Bring a girl to be my maid.
One who could disappear and not be missed.

954
01:46:14,452 --> 01:46:16,162
<i>If a bit dense, all the better.</i>

955
01:46:16,245 --> 01:46:20,333
We'll send her to a madhouse
under my name.

956
01:46:22,752 --> 01:46:24,670
They dig a hole in the ground,

957
01:46:24,754 --> 01:46:27,590
put a patient in there and close the lid.

958
01:46:28,508 --> 01:46:31,094
I want my name to be buried in that hole.

959
01:46:32,136 --> 01:46:34,639
I can find you a new maid,

960
01:46:34,722 --> 01:46:36,933
but what do we do about Junko?

961
01:46:42,313 --> 01:46:47,276
You really think
I'm prettier than Miss Hideko?

962
01:46:48,694 --> 01:46:52,782
Sure, Hideko's pretty, and you're pretty.

963
01:46:52,865 --> 01:46:54,575
What? You speak Korean?

964
01:46:56,244 --> 01:46:57,703
You know...

965
01:46:58,788 --> 01:46:59,622
I learned it.

966
01:47:00,540 --> 01:47:02,583
To speak more easily with you.

967
01:47:04,377 --> 01:47:06,838
I really wanted to say this to you.

968
01:47:08,548 --> 01:47:10,091
You are just mesmerizing.

969
01:47:10,174 --> 01:47:11,592
Oh my gosh!

970
01:47:13,553 --> 01:47:15,138
You little tart!

971
01:47:20,268 --> 01:47:22,311
I can't!

972
01:47:22,687 --> 01:47:25,481
<i>If they catch me with a guest,
I'll be thrown out!</i>

973
01:47:26,607 --> 01:47:30,987
<i>Forget this wretched place.
Come live with me!</i>

974
01:48:18,034 --> 01:48:19,160
Oh, fucking hell!

975
01:48:20,077 --> 01:48:21,162
Fucking hell?

976
01:48:21,245 --> 01:48:22,622
Fucking hell...

977
01:49:13,548 --> 01:49:16,217
<i>The Count sent exactly what I ordered.</i>

978
01:49:16,300 --> 01:49:18,511
<i>Naive and a bit foolish.</i>

979
01:49:22,348 --> 01:49:24,600
We're alike, somehow.

980
01:49:25,309 --> 01:49:26,686
I heard you're an orphan, too.

981
01:49:30,982 --> 01:49:32,233
Mother!

982
01:49:43,494 --> 01:49:48,291
<i>Show Sookee your clothes
and jewellery at every opportunity.</i>

983
01:49:48,708 --> 01:49:53,087
<i>The material greed she got from her
mother will make her more gullible.</i>

984
01:49:53,170 --> 01:49:59,176
<i>P.S. Don't worry if she reads
this letter, she's totally illiterate.</i>

985
01:49:59,260 --> 01:50:00,761
Would you read it to me?

986
01:50:01,178 --> 01:50:02,263
Pardon?

987
01:50:03,431 --> 01:50:07,435
"...looking for a maid.
Maids are like...

988
01:50:08,519 --> 01:50:10,021
a spoon... no...

989
01:50:12,106 --> 01:50:14,567
are like chopsticks..."

990
01:50:18,487 --> 01:50:20,448
Is it a spoon?

991
01:50:20,531 --> 01:50:21,407
COUNTESS FUJIWARA HIDEKO

992
01:50:21,490 --> 01:50:24,285
This is your name. Can't you read it?

993
01:50:29,832 --> 01:50:31,167
What's with your foot?

994
01:50:35,713 --> 01:50:36,547
<i>Who did it?</i>

995
01:50:37,340 --> 01:50:39,342
<i>Who took Tamako 's shoe?</i>

996
01:50:46,724 --> 01:50:48,267
Apologize before all the servants!

997
01:50:52,229 --> 01:50:55,107
If she ever runs away
because of one of you,

998
01:50:55,191 --> 01:50:57,068
I'll strip you all naked
and throw you out!

999
01:50:58,861 --> 01:50:59,820
Fucking hell.

1000
01:51:04,700 --> 01:51:05,785
All smooth.

1001
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:14,210
Do you like the scent?

1002
01:51:15,252 --> 01:51:16,879
Do you want to come in?

1003
01:51:16,962 --> 01:51:17,797
Pardon?

1004
01:51:38,359 --> 01:51:39,944
<i>This must be Okju.</i>

1005
01:51:40,027 --> 01:51:42,947
At your service, milord.

1006
01:51:43,864 --> 01:51:47,451
<i>You know if you fail,
it'll put me in an awkward position.</i>

1007
01:51:52,581 --> 01:51:56,210
A decent bone structure for a Korean...

1008
01:51:59,672 --> 01:52:04,093
So, are you carrying out
your duties faithfully?

1009
01:52:07,805 --> 01:52:10,558
- What?
- <i>Thank you for introducing her.</i>

1010
01:52:11,100 --> 01:52:15,646
You found the perfect maid for me.

1011
01:52:16,731 --> 01:52:20,401
<i>It was tough looking for one
that wasn't chubby.</i>

1012
01:52:21,193 --> 01:52:24,447
<i>Take care of the lonely lady.</i>

1013
01:52:25,114 --> 01:52:25,948
<i>Here.</i>

1014
01:52:28,993 --> 01:52:31,912
<i>Becoming the lady's friend</i>

1015
01:52:31,996 --> 01:52:33,873
<i>and getting paid for it</i>

1016
01:52:34,331 --> 01:52:35,750
<i>is nothing to be ashamed of.</i>

1017
01:52:38,419 --> 01:52:40,171
<i>Isn't that right, Miss?</i>

1018
01:52:42,298 --> 01:52:43,966
There's no need to be ashamed at all.

1019
01:52:44,049 --> 01:52:46,343
Your average fence
can barely tell them apart.

1020
01:52:46,427 --> 01:52:48,429
Is that so?

1021
01:52:53,976 --> 01:52:55,978
<i>"I'm returning the earrings
you loaned me.</i>

1022
01:52:56,562 --> 01:52:59,440
<i>A woman might wager her fate
on such an exquisite pair.</i>

1023
01:53:00,649 --> 01:53:03,319
<i>I'm sure that
Sookee will try her very best</i>

1024
01:53:03,402 --> 01:53:07,782
<i>in order to see herself
wearing these in the mirror.</i>

1025
01:53:08,616 --> 01:53:12,119
I'll tell you how to keep her
from getting suspicious.

1026
01:53:12,203 --> 01:53:15,331
Keep her busy
until the day of the wedding.

1027
01:53:15,831 --> 01:53:17,958
Make her spend all her energy

1028
01:53:18,042 --> 01:53:20,377
on making you fall in love with me."

1029
01:53:22,296 --> 01:53:25,633
In other words,
don't fall in love with me so easily.

1030
01:53:36,477 --> 01:53:37,311
Mesmerizing!

1031
01:53:40,689 --> 01:53:41,524
Me?

1032
01:53:50,699 --> 01:53:53,160
Dressed up, you look like a lady too.

1033
01:54:01,460 --> 01:54:03,128
Almost fully ripe.

1034
01:54:12,888 --> 01:54:15,307
How did your mother die?

1035
01:54:15,808 --> 01:54:19,186
That she was so lucky
to have you before dying.

1036
01:54:20,020 --> 01:54:22,064
That she had no regrets.

1037
01:54:23,482 --> 01:54:27,570
<i>Is this the companionship
they write about in books?</i>

1038
01:54:30,531 --> 01:54:31,574
<i>I'll go pick mushrooms.</i>

1039
01:54:31,657 --> 01:54:35,452
<i>We'll have mushroom stew tonight,
you like that.</i>

1040
01:54:35,536 --> 01:54:36,912
<i>I'll go with you.</i>

1041
01:54:37,872 --> 01:54:38,706
I'll be quick.

1042
01:54:38,789 --> 01:54:39,790
Before it rains.

1043
01:54:53,512 --> 01:54:55,764
<i>What's with her?</i>

1044
01:55:04,231 --> 01:55:05,774
Men are disgusting.

1045
01:55:06,275 --> 01:55:09,153
How can they be so single-minded?

1046
01:55:09,737 --> 01:55:10,905
What's on my mind?

1047
01:55:12,197 --> 01:55:15,451
You don't really believe
that I crave your body, do you?

1048
01:55:17,578 --> 01:55:18,704
You do!

1049
01:55:18,787 --> 01:55:20,414
You read too many of those books.

1050
01:55:20,497 --> 01:55:22,291
If there's one thing I'm after, Miss...

1051
01:55:23,542 --> 01:55:28,547
It's not your eyes, your hands or ass,

1052
01:55:28,923 --> 01:55:31,508
it's your money, only that.

1053
01:55:32,051 --> 01:55:34,094
Of all that you have, money is the best.

1054
01:55:36,430 --> 01:55:39,725
It feels great being so rude
to a noble lady.

1055
01:55:40,476 --> 01:55:42,061
<i>What's with her?</i>

1056
01:55:42,728 --> 01:55:46,565
<i>Why does she stomp her feet,
expressing her anger,</i>

1057
01:55:46,982 --> 01:55:49,443
<i>sit up in the middle of the night
and sigh?</i>

1058
01:55:51,236 --> 01:55:55,324
<i>Every time she sees the Count,
her eyes seem to say,</i>

1059
01:55:56,116 --> 01:55:57,368
I despise you.

1060
01:55:58,661 --> 01:56:00,162
<i>Try to bear it.</i>

1061
01:56:00,245 --> 01:56:03,457
Only if she sees this
will she believe the proposal.

1062
01:56:23,060 --> 01:56:27,106
Think of me as that puppet,
and I'll imagine another woman.

1063
01:56:27,564 --> 01:56:29,608
What woman?

1064
01:56:32,194 --> 01:56:33,612
The duchess Juliette.

1065
01:56:36,573 --> 01:56:38,242
<i>Lady!</i>

1066
01:56:38,993 --> 01:56:40,494
<i>Milord!</i>

1067
01:56:46,208 --> 01:56:47,543
Lady...

1068
01:56:52,965 --> 01:56:56,552
<i>"The lady's emotions lay deep inside...</i>

1069
01:56:57,177 --> 01:56:59,680
<i>Jinlian could not fathom their depths.</i>

1070
01:57:01,724 --> 01:57:03,809
<i>Knowing this, Lady Sun</i>

1071
01:57:03,892 --> 01:57:08,022
<i>gave Jinlian four small silver balls.</i>

1072
01:57:08,105 --> 01:57:12,609
These are 'minling',
or 'bells of passion'.

1073
01:57:12,693 --> 01:57:16,071
<i>Place two in the lady's Jade Gate,</i>

1074
01:57:16,488 --> 01:57:19,700
<i>and the other two in yours.</i>

1075
01:57:22,202 --> 01:57:24,204
<i>Spread your legs apart</i>

1076
01:57:24,288 --> 01:57:26,790
<i>and like two scissors</i>

1077
01:57:26,874 --> 01:57:29,001
<i>trying to cut each other,
put them together.</i>

1078
01:57:29,376 --> 01:57:32,171
<i>When the lips below rub
against each another,</i>

1079
01:57:32,254 --> 01:57:34,298
<i>you'll hear a clear ringing sound."</i>

1080
01:57:34,381 --> 01:57:36,508
<i>A blackout! Bring a lantern!</i>

1081
01:57:36,592 --> 01:57:38,135
<i>Yes, sir!</i>

1082
01:57:38,218 --> 01:57:41,346
THE SOUND OF BELLS
ON A WINDLESS NIGHT

1083
01:57:43,182 --> 01:57:47,394
"'When do I put this in?'
asked Jinlian.

1084
01:57:48,228 --> 01:57:52,691
Does the lady breathe deeply
and swallow hard?

1085
01:57:54,109 --> 01:57:57,237
<i>Does she whisper sweetly in your ear,</i>

1086
01:57:57,321 --> 01:57:59,198
<i>and kiss you?</i>

1087
01:58:04,161 --> 01:58:06,246
Does she embrace you tightly

1088
01:58:06,330 --> 01:58:08,248
and caress your nipples?

1089
01:58:10,667 --> 01:58:15,214
Does her secret part become slippery

1090
01:58:16,507 --> 01:58:23,138
as she gently bites your shoulder?

1091
01:58:24,640 --> 01:58:27,851
<i>Then, put in the bells."</i>

1092
01:58:32,606 --> 01:58:34,983
<i>- Amazing!
- Indeed!</i>

1093
01:58:54,253 --> 01:58:56,088
It's so cute.

1094
01:59:01,885 --> 01:59:03,470
If the Count sees this...

1095
01:59:10,894 --> 01:59:13,272
Will he really be as tender as this?

1096
01:59:14,773 --> 01:59:16,024
Of course.

1097
01:59:16,108 --> 01:59:19,027
And he'll touch you like this...

1098
01:59:20,028 --> 01:59:21,155
And like this...

1099
01:59:29,913 --> 01:59:31,707
Tamako, keep doing

1100
01:59:32,791 --> 01:59:34,418
what the Count will.

1101
01:59:37,171 --> 01:59:38,338
The Count...

1102
01:59:38,839 --> 01:59:40,632
The Count...

1103
01:59:40,716 --> 01:59:43,302
He'll go crazy over this.

1104
01:59:45,637 --> 01:59:49,099
And this is what he'll say.

1105
01:59:51,351 --> 01:59:57,107
<i>"It's so soft, warm, wet, and...</i>

1106
02:00:01,111 --> 02:00:05,240
<i>s... s... spellbindingly beautiful!"</i>

1107
02:00:37,147 --> 02:00:40,067
Shall I teach you more, Miss?

1108
02:00:40,150 --> 02:00:42,527
Yes...

1109
02:00:43,111 --> 02:00:44,571
Teach me everything.

1110
02:01:29,533 --> 02:01:33,870
I wish that I had breast milk
so I could feed you.

1111
02:01:48,844 --> 02:01:50,595
Do you like it when I do this?

1112
02:01:52,264 --> 02:01:53,598
Do you like me?

1113
02:01:55,517 --> 02:01:58,270
Can you promise that you won't betray me?

1114
02:01:59,938 --> 02:02:01,857
I'll never...

1115
02:02:01,940 --> 02:02:02,858
never...

1116
02:02:04,234 --> 02:02:05,235
ever...

1117
02:02:19,750 --> 02:02:25,756
Miss, how could such an innocent...

1118
02:02:26,173 --> 02:02:27,883
You must be a natural.

1119
02:03:24,022 --> 02:03:24,856
Stop!

1120
02:03:27,484 --> 02:03:30,153
I spit it out without chewing!
All because of you!

1121
02:03:30,987 --> 02:03:32,656
<i>She's got no one on this earth.</i>

1122
02:03:32,739 --> 02:03:36,076
<i>If you frighten her,
she'll close up hard as a clam.</i>

1123
02:03:36,159 --> 02:03:37,702
<i>And please...</i>

1124
02:03:38,161 --> 02:03:43,125
Don't ever again put my hand
on your tiny joke of a cock.

1125
02:03:50,215 --> 02:03:51,216
<i>You see?</i>

1126
02:03:52,843 --> 02:03:55,512
If you don't give the impression
you want this marriage,

1127
02:03:55,595 --> 02:03:58,849
she may throw another fit
and refuse to go forward.

1128
02:03:58,932 --> 02:04:02,060
Be more convincing
when you pretend to love me.

1129
02:04:02,144 --> 02:04:03,228
I can't do it.

1130
02:04:03,603 --> 02:04:04,438
What?

1131
02:04:05,188 --> 02:04:06,523
I want to quit.

1132
02:04:08,692 --> 02:04:09,860
What's with you all today?

1133
02:04:11,570 --> 02:04:12,487
Why?

1134
02:04:13,613 --> 02:04:15,615
I hate everyone.
My mom, dad, aunt, uncle,

1135
02:04:15,699 --> 02:04:16,950
you and...

1136
02:04:22,831 --> 02:04:24,332
I don't like Sookee, either.

1137
02:04:24,416 --> 02:04:26,001
You feel sorry for her?

1138
02:04:29,379 --> 02:04:31,381
What is it with women?

1139
02:04:34,593 --> 02:04:38,180
You know what that poor Sookee said
about your Ladyship?

1140
02:04:38,763 --> 02:04:42,350
That you're too naive to get it
even if someone pulls on your nipples.

1141
02:04:42,434 --> 02:04:45,353
<i>That she was nice out of pity,
but you ate it up.</i>

1142
02:04:45,437 --> 02:04:47,147
<i>That you were so gullible!</i>

1143
02:04:47,230 --> 02:04:50,859
<i>That naive servant's face...</i>

1144
02:04:50,942 --> 02:04:53,278
Yes... you will love him.

1145
02:04:53,361 --> 02:04:56,406
If I say that I love someone else...

1146
02:04:57,824 --> 02:05:02,162
I have no one on this earth...

1147
02:05:02,746 --> 02:05:05,165
Would you still want me to marry him?

1148
02:05:05,582 --> 02:05:06,416
Yes.

1149
02:05:18,220 --> 02:05:19,137
<i>Miss!</i>

1150
02:05:41,910 --> 02:05:44,412
<i>I wish I'd never been born.</i>

1151
02:06:16,736 --> 02:06:19,948
<i>I wish I'd never been born.</i>

1152
02:06:39,884 --> 02:06:40,885
Let go.

1153
02:06:43,638 --> 02:06:46,683
Miss, I'm sorry!

1154
02:06:49,311 --> 02:06:50,145
Let go!

1155
02:06:50,812 --> 02:06:52,731
I'm sorry, Miss!

1156
02:06:53,106 --> 02:06:54,608
Don't die.

1157
02:06:54,691 --> 02:06:56,901
I'm sorry.

1158
02:06:58,862 --> 02:07:00,196
<i>What are you sorry about?</i>

1159
02:07:02,198 --> 02:07:06,786
I tried to trick you
into marrying that bastard.

1160
02:07:06,870 --> 02:07:09,914
I was going to put you
in a madhouse and run off.

1161
02:07:11,333 --> 02:07:15,253
Don't die. Don't get married, Miss!

1162
02:07:17,547 --> 02:07:21,009
Sookee, are you worried about me?

1163
02:07:26,640 --> 02:07:28,266
I'm worried about you.

1164
02:07:33,730 --> 02:07:36,399
How do you know my name?

1165
02:07:37,859 --> 02:07:39,986
You think you're tricking me?

1166
02:07:42,614 --> 02:07:43,990
You're the one being tricked.

1167
02:07:45,659 --> 02:07:47,869
You're the one bound for the madhouse.

1168
02:07:50,080 --> 02:07:52,540
<i>I was going to lock you up
in there under my name,</i>

1169
02:07:53,291 --> 02:07:56,169
then I'd become you
and run far away with him.

1170
02:08:01,257 --> 02:08:04,719
I won't say sorry,
since you tried to trick me too.

1171
02:08:12,018 --> 02:08:14,521
That fucking son of a bitch!

1172
02:08:16,981 --> 02:08:19,984
Oh, sorry Miss!

1173
02:08:20,902 --> 02:08:25,156
<i>"I hope this letter finds you well.
This is Sookee.</i>

1174
02:08:25,615 --> 02:08:30,078
<i>I'm writing to inform you
of a change in plans.</i>

1175
02:08:30,161 --> 02:08:35,375
<i>I decided to team up
with the Lady Hideko.</i>

1176
02:08:35,458 --> 02:08:38,753
<i>As such, I'm now in need
of all your help.</i>

1177
02:08:38,837 --> 02:08:41,840
<i>I'm enclosing an item
as advance payment."</i>

1178
02:08:41,923 --> 02:08:46,302
Always remember the basement.

1179
02:09:00,650 --> 02:09:02,610
Do you want to go somewhere nice?

1180
02:09:46,529 --> 02:09:48,823
<i>You didn't teach me to read Japanese.</i>

1181
02:10:11,387 --> 02:10:13,348
Did that bastard draw this?

1182
02:10:15,850 --> 02:10:20,814
Is this what you've been reading
to that dirty old man

1183
02:10:21,314 --> 02:10:22,690
and those gentlemen?

1184
02:12:29,400 --> 02:12:32,570
<i>The daughter of a legendary thief,</i>

1185
02:12:32,654 --> 02:12:34,864
<i>who sewed winter coats
out of stolen purses,</i>

1186
02:12:34,948 --> 02:12:38,117
<i>who was a thief, pickpocket
and swindler.</i>

1187
02:12:39,285 --> 02:12:41,788
<i>She is the savior who came
to tear my life apart.</i>

1188
02:12:42,413 --> 02:12:43,915
<i>My Tamako.</i>

1189
02:12:44,791 --> 02:12:45,792
<i>My Sookee.</i>

1190
02:14:07,415 --> 02:14:09,333
<i>How cruel can you be?</i>

1191
02:14:09,417 --> 02:14:12,670
<i>You plucked the flower, now re-plant it.</i>

1192
02:14:12,754 --> 02:14:14,756
<i>What do you want?</i>

1193
02:14:14,839 --> 02:14:17,967
<i>Hurry up and throw her
into the madhouse!</i>

1194
02:14:23,431 --> 02:14:24,932
You scoundrel!

1195
02:14:25,433 --> 02:14:27,685
Let go of me, you filthy bitches!

1196
02:14:29,228 --> 02:14:30,646
Miss!

1197
02:14:31,147 --> 02:14:32,648
Let go!

1198
02:14:34,400 --> 02:14:35,777
Miss!

1199
02:14:50,917 --> 02:14:51,918
I'm hungry.

1200
02:14:56,589 --> 02:15:01,135
<i>The first month,
I ordered a slim herringbone suit.</i>

1201
02:15:01,844 --> 02:15:04,889
The next month,
I wore it to dine at the Imperial Hotel.

1202
02:15:04,972 --> 02:15:05,807
PART THREE

1203
02:15:05,890 --> 02:15:08,810
Me, a colonial boy working
as a tout at a brothel.

1204
02:15:08,893 --> 02:15:11,979
Some Englishmen who frequented the brothel
recognized me.

1205
02:15:12,063 --> 02:15:15,650
I thought they'd call the maitre d'
and kick me out,

1206
02:15:16,400 --> 02:15:17,443
but what do you know?

1207
02:15:18,402 --> 02:15:22,782
They were amused I'd spend a month's pay

1208
02:15:22,865 --> 02:15:24,325
on one dignified meal.

1209
02:15:25,451 --> 02:15:27,745
<i>They started calling me "Count"</i>

1210
02:15:27,829 --> 02:15:29,664
<i>and taught me manners
to go with the name.</i>

1211
02:15:29,747 --> 02:15:31,749
<i>Frankly, I'm not that
interested in money itself.</i>

1212
02:15:32,333 --> 02:15:34,585
What I desire is, how shall I put it...

1213
02:15:35,753 --> 02:15:38,256
The manner of ordering wine
without looking at the price?

1214
02:15:38,714 --> 02:15:39,924
Something like that.

1215
02:15:51,936 --> 02:15:54,438
<i>Fourteen hours by train from Vladivostok</i>

1216
02:15:54,522 --> 02:15:56,524
<i>is the summer home
of a genuine Russian noble family.</i>

1217
02:15:56,607 --> 02:15:58,484
<i>All the furniture is set</i>

1218
02:15:58,568 --> 02:16:00,945
along with ankle-deep carpets.

1219
02:16:08,369 --> 02:16:09,704
Shall we marry there?

1220
02:16:15,168 --> 02:16:17,420
<i>In a few days,
I'll hear from the hospital.</i>

1221
02:16:19,338 --> 02:16:22,008
<i>That my wife Fujiwara Hideko
has died.</i>

1222
02:16:26,053 --> 02:16:28,681
You didn't just ask them to keep her?

1223
02:16:29,599 --> 02:16:32,894
I doubt Sookee would want
to live there very long.

1224
02:16:41,611 --> 02:16:42,653
Fuck!

1225
02:16:47,617 --> 02:16:49,243
<i>Bastard.</i>

1226
02:16:49,327 --> 02:16:52,747
I never said I wasn't a bastard.

1227
02:16:54,373 --> 02:16:58,628
<i>You'll become a colonial girl
named Nam Sookee.</i>

1228
02:16:58,711 --> 02:17:00,671
You know I'm an expert
at document forgery, right?

1229
02:17:00,755 --> 02:17:02,715
I arranged it with a photography studio.

1230
02:17:03,966 --> 02:17:07,720
From tomorrow,
we'll give Sookee a new life.

1231
02:17:07,803 --> 02:17:09,096
I'm glad.

1232
02:17:09,180 --> 02:17:10,848
<i>Marry me once again.</i>

1233
02:17:11,849 --> 02:17:13,434
This time as Nam Sookee.

1234
02:17:15,436 --> 02:17:17,355
You want another wedding night?

1235
02:17:23,778 --> 02:17:26,906
I think I slightly like you.

1236
02:17:30,409 --> 02:17:32,662
Poor Sookee, in a place like that

1237
02:17:33,955 --> 02:17:35,790
all by herself...

1238
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:41,087
Did such a thought ever cross your mind?

1239
02:17:41,545 --> 02:17:43,673
Not at all. Why should I pity her?

1240
02:17:44,173 --> 02:17:46,717
Where I come from,
it's illegal to be naive.

1241
02:17:47,468 --> 02:17:50,972
Where you come from, it's not naive
to fall in love with a business partner?

1242
02:17:51,055 --> 02:17:53,140
Of course. It's illegal.

1243
02:17:53,641 --> 02:17:56,978
So even if my love for you
leads me to ruin,

1244
02:17:57,561 --> 02:17:58,980
don't pity me.

1245
02:17:59,772 --> 02:18:00,606
<i>Love?</i>

1246
02:18:02,900 --> 02:18:04,694
What does a crook know about love?

1247
02:18:27,550 --> 02:18:30,094
Fire!

1248
02:18:39,687 --> 02:18:42,023
C... c... come this way!

1249
02:18:42,106 --> 02:18:44,483
This way!

1250
02:19:53,761 --> 02:19:56,597
Because you desired me,

1251
02:19:56,680 --> 02:19:58,933
and overcame all obstacles to reach me,

1252
02:19:59,016 --> 02:20:00,976
I have been born anew, it's true.

1253
02:20:02,561 --> 02:20:04,230
I'm grateful for that.

1254
02:20:06,607 --> 02:20:08,484
I'll allow a kiss.

1255
02:20:13,572 --> 02:20:14,407
No.

1256
02:20:14,824 --> 02:20:15,658
Why not?

1257
02:20:19,036 --> 02:20:21,080
I don't like kisses with conditions.

1258
02:20:21,163 --> 02:20:23,791
I never learned how to stop halfway.

1259
02:20:26,043 --> 02:20:31,382
After this I'll thrust in deep,
to your navel.

1260
02:20:32,466 --> 02:20:33,968
Please do that.

1261
02:20:37,680 --> 02:20:39,223
Those aren't the eyes of one who wants it.

1262
02:20:39,807 --> 02:20:42,435
<i>You know you can't deceive me
in such matters.</i>

1263
02:20:47,606 --> 02:20:51,694
If I could be yours for ten minutes,

1264
02:20:51,777 --> 02:20:53,028
what would you give in exchange?

1265
02:20:54,405 --> 02:20:56,699
Whatever your heart desires.

1266
02:20:56,782 --> 02:20:59,076
Anything in this whole wide world.

1267
02:21:23,934 --> 02:21:25,561
There's much I want to teach you.

1268
02:21:27,563 --> 02:21:30,316
You'll become a completely new woman.

1269
02:23:21,927 --> 02:23:24,847
It won't hurt.
You've seen it in those books.

1270
02:23:24,930 --> 02:23:28,767
In truth, women feel the greatest pleasure

1271
02:23:28,851 --> 02:23:30,519
when taken by force.

1272
02:23:31,061 --> 02:23:33,856
Now I'm going to rip your underwear.

1273
02:25:51,952 --> 02:25:54,079
Would you fetch those for me?

1274
02:26:04,089 --> 02:26:07,009
Okay, here we go.

1275
02:26:07,092 --> 02:26:09,011
One, two, three.

1276
02:26:50,511 --> 02:26:52,471
<i>Respected Uncle,</i>

1277
02:26:53,555 --> 02:26:55,390
<i>it always pained me</i>

1278
02:26:55,849 --> 02:26:58,560
<i>to see you straining
to speak flawless Japanese</i>

1279
02:26:58,644 --> 02:27:03,190
<i>before the Count from Nagoya
and even to quiver your voice</i>

1280
02:27:03,273 --> 02:27:06,360
<i>like a nobleman.</i>

1281
02:27:08,695 --> 02:27:14,743
<i>So I'm happy to inform you
that you no longer need do so.</i>

1282
02:27:15,911 --> 02:27:20,541
<i>That man is the son
of a Korean farmhand.</i>

1283
02:27:21,542 --> 02:27:25,879
<i>Oh, did my gift arrive safely?</i>

1284
02:27:26,964 --> 02:27:30,592
<i>Please tell this to my gift, in Korean.</i>

1285
02:27:31,510 --> 02:27:33,262
<i>I'm afraid that in real life,</i>

1286
02:27:34,346 --> 02:27:37,641
<i>no woman feels pleasure
at being taken by force.</i>

1287
02:27:38,058 --> 02:27:43,522
<i>But, for sending me Sookee
out of all the girls in the world,</i>

1288
02:27:43,605 --> 02:27:45,732
<i>I feel "slightly" grateful.</i>

1289
02:27:59,329 --> 02:28:02,666
You wished to see my bookmaking tools?

1290
02:28:03,292 --> 02:28:06,587
Don't just look,
experience them for yourself.

1291
02:28:07,588 --> 02:28:09,381
I'll choose five books that I cherish...

1292
02:28:10,090 --> 02:28:12,718
that I used to cherish more than anything.

1293
02:28:15,012 --> 02:28:17,180
Let's see... First,

1294
02:28:20,267 --> 02:28:22,352
<i>Confessions of a Whip</i>

1295
02:28:31,153 --> 02:28:32,446
<i>The Lizard Skin</i>

1296
02:28:44,958 --> 02:28:48,629
<i>Decadent Girls Who Sell Lingerie</i>

1297
02:28:57,971 --> 02:29:00,682
May I please smoke a cigarette, sir?

1298
02:29:01,767 --> 02:29:02,601
Sir.

1299
02:29:05,771 --> 02:29:06,980
<i>Bells and Balls</i>

1300
02:29:11,318 --> 02:29:12,945
<i>The Mortician's Bedroom</i>

1301
02:29:25,457 --> 02:29:28,085
How could you let a little girl fool you?

1302
02:29:31,463 --> 02:29:35,968
<i>But don't worry.
I'll catch them for you soon.</i>

1303
02:29:41,348 --> 02:29:44,101
I'll bind books with the skin
of those two bitches and you

1304
02:29:44,184 --> 02:29:48,230
and place them on the shelf.

1305
02:29:49,606 --> 02:29:54,861
I arranged so that no two girls
traveling together can leave Kobe.

1306
02:29:57,698 --> 02:29:59,866
Please change the destination to Shanghai.

1307
02:30:00,283 --> 02:30:03,370
Changing two tickets,
from Vladivostok to Shanghai.

1308
02:30:03,453 --> 02:30:05,205
Yes, that's correct.

1309
02:30:05,998 --> 02:30:06,957
<i>Show me your passports.</i>

1310
02:30:14,673 --> 02:30:16,133
Miss Nam Sookee?

1311
02:30:19,553 --> 02:30:20,762
<i>Mr. Go Pan-dol?</i>

1312
02:30:29,396 --> 02:30:31,857
You need to pay an additional 3 yen.

1313
02:30:32,482 --> 02:30:33,316
All right.

1314
02:30:37,988 --> 02:30:43,076
Hideko is a peach
that I left on the branch,

1315
02:30:43,744 --> 02:30:46,163
imagining what the taste will be like.

1316
02:30:46,955 --> 02:30:49,833
Would I have plucked it someday?

1317
02:30:50,500 --> 02:30:51,334
No.

1318
02:30:52,627 --> 02:30:57,007
I'm just an old man
who likes dirty stories.

1319
02:30:58,884 --> 02:31:02,012
Even listening to the same story,
people imagine different things.

1320
02:31:03,013 --> 02:31:06,016
Peering into each of those fantasies

1321
02:31:06,558 --> 02:31:09,519
was this old man's humble recreation.

1322
02:31:10,020 --> 02:31:13,106
What to do, now that it's all over?

1323
02:31:13,774 --> 02:31:16,151
You should at least tell me your story.

1324
02:31:17,986 --> 02:31:21,198
<i>How did that bitch Hideko taste?</i>

1325
02:31:22,282 --> 02:31:25,243
Was she fully ripe?
Tell me.

1326
02:31:28,246 --> 02:31:30,624
A cigarette might help my memory.

1327
02:31:31,792 --> 02:31:34,044
Right, right...

1328
02:31:34,836 --> 02:31:38,590
You have that silly penchant
for cigarettes?

1329
02:31:55,607 --> 02:31:59,319
So how was Hideko?

1330
02:32:05,617 --> 02:32:09,412
You have no windows here.

1331
02:32:13,166 --> 02:32:16,169
Sookee could be listening in.
Let's do our best.

1332
02:32:28,265 --> 02:32:29,516
<i>That's it, good.</i>

1333
02:32:42,028 --> 02:32:43,738
<i>What's this?</i>

1334
02:32:43,822 --> 02:32:46,199
You can't stop there, dear fellow.

1335
02:32:46,283 --> 02:32:48,618
So, where did you touch first?

1336
02:32:49,077 --> 02:32:49,911
<i>Her face?</i>

1337
02:32:52,706 --> 02:32:54,082
Her breasts?

1338
02:32:55,709 --> 02:32:57,711
Or straight for her
c... cunt?

1339
02:33:00,213 --> 02:33:01,631
Was it soft?

1340
02:33:02,507 --> 02:33:04,050
Did it tighten up?

1341
02:33:05,719 --> 02:33:07,554
Did it have many wrinkles?

1342
02:33:08,555 --> 02:33:10,724
Was it sufficiently wet?

1343
02:33:10,807 --> 02:33:14,311
How was the viscosity and transparency
of her vaginal secretion?

1344
02:33:15,770 --> 02:33:17,898
Please, one more cigarette, sir.

1345
02:33:44,883 --> 02:33:52,057
<i>Spider thread pulled into strings...</i>

1346
02:33:52,140 --> 02:33:55,894
<i>I dare say no book
has ever described</i>

1347
02:33:55,977 --> 02:33:58,980
<i>such a ferocious wedding night.</i>

1348
02:34:03,485 --> 02:34:07,113
<i>I thought I heard a nightingale sing.</i>

1349
02:34:41,940 --> 02:34:46,945
<i>And the clear, bright crimson blood...</i>

1350
02:34:56,079 --> 02:34:58,290
<i>Thus the Lady became my wife.</i>

1351
02:34:58,873 --> 02:35:02,836
<i>Coy one moment, bold the next...</i>

1352
02:35:06,506 --> 02:35:10,760
But how was she coy,

1353
02:35:11,344 --> 02:35:15,515
<i>how was she bold,
tell it to me in detail!</i>

1354
02:35:16,016 --> 02:35:19,394
A story is all about the journey.

1355
02:35:19,477 --> 02:35:21,187
You should know.

1356
02:35:23,315 --> 02:35:24,858
<i>Did she resist?</i>

1357
02:35:25,984 --> 02:35:28,361
So did you pinch her ass as punishment?

1358
02:35:28,820 --> 02:35:32,490
Or did she spit at you in contempt?

1359
02:35:33,616 --> 02:35:35,035
Or else...

1360
02:35:35,660 --> 02:35:37,829
Did she beg you to do it?

1361
02:35:38,872 --> 02:35:42,250
Like the lady in
<i>The Widow's Lapdog</i> ?

1362
02:35:45,795 --> 02:35:47,047
How dare you!

1363
02:35:47,464 --> 02:35:49,090
Hideko is my wife.

1364
02:35:49,674 --> 02:35:53,970
What kind of scoundrel rattles on
about his wedding night!

1365
02:37:30,233 --> 02:37:31,776
<i>It's odd...</i>

1366
02:37:33,194 --> 02:37:34,988
Your smoke.

1367
02:37:37,490 --> 02:37:40,910
It's cold, blue...

1368
02:37:42,370 --> 02:37:48,042
<i>and strangely beautiful.</i>

1369
02:37:49,586 --> 02:37:56,217
You too have become soft, slow and dull.

1370
02:37:57,969 --> 02:38:00,930
Mercury is most deadly
in its gaseous state.

1371
02:38:01,931 --> 02:38:03,766
One cigarette would have sufficed.

1372
02:38:07,979 --> 02:38:12,275
At least I will die with my cock intact.

1373
02:42:27,822 --> 02:42:33,327
THE HANDMAIDEN EXTENDED VERSION

1374
02:44:55,052 --> 02:44:59,265
<i>I hear a sound in the distance</i>

1375
02:44:59,348 --> 02:45:03,561
<i>that sounds like the steps of my love</i>

1376
02:45:03,644 --> 02:45:07,940
<i>An echo that makes my heart</i>

1377
02:45:08,024 --> 02:45:11,193
<i>skip a beat</i>

1378
02:45:12,278 --> 02:45:16,032
<i>But I wait all through the night</i>

1379
02:45:16,532 --> 02:45:20,453
<i>and my love never comes to me</i>

1380
02:45:20,828 --> 02:45:24,582
<i>There is no end to the heartache</i>

1381
02:45:25,082 --> 02:45:28,628
<i>that grips me in this hour</i>

1382
02:45:29,337 --> 02:45:33,132
<i>Waiting for the footsteps of</i>

1383
02:45:33,549 --> 02:45:36,719
<i>my dear love</i>

1384
02:45:37,970 --> 02:45:42,016
<i>Waiting for the footsteps of</i>

1385
02:45:42,099 --> 02:45:46,729
<i>my dear love</i>

1386
02:46:03,704 --> 02:46:07,750
<i>But then in my waiting heart</i>

1387
02:46:07,833 --> 02:46:12,171
<i>suddenly happiness overflows</i>

1388
02:46:12,254 --> 02:46:16,092
<i>There you are in the distance</i>

1389
02:46:16,509 --> 02:46:19,553
<i>coming to me</i>

1390
02:46:20,805 --> 02:46:25,017
<i>Filled with dreams of a new life</i>

1391
02:46:25,101 --> 02:46:29,313
<i>filled with happiness</i>

1392
02:46:29,397 --> 02:46:33,609
<i>Inside my waiting heart</i>

1393
02:46:33,693 --> 02:46:37,822
<i>flowers start to bloom</i>

1394
02:46:37,905 --> 02:46:41,742
<i>Come my lover, come to me</i>

1395
02:46:42,243 --> 02:46:45,454
<i>I missed you so</i>

1396
02:46:46,580 --> 02:46:50,751
<i>Let's dream of happy times</i>

1397
02:46:50,835 --> 02:46:55,214
<i>like long ago</i>

1398
02:47:12,273 --> 02:47:16,068
<i>Filled with dreams of a new life</i>

1399
02:47:16,569 --> 02:47:20,156
<i>filled with happiness</i>

1400
02:47:20,906 --> 02:47:25,036
<i>Inside my waiting heart</i>

1401
02:47:25,119 --> 02:47:28,664
<i>flowers start to bloom</i>

1402
02:47:29,415 --> 02:47:33,502
<i>Waiting for the footsteps of</i>

1403
02:47:33,586 --> 02:47:36,714
<i>my dear love</i>

1404
02:47:37,965 --> 02:47:41,719
<i>Waiting for the footsteps of</i>

1405
02:47:42,178 --> 02:47:46,307
<i>my dear love</i>
