A rice cooker, it's yours, Mrs. Koo?

149
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,990
像我們這些老古板
No, it's beyond us.

150
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:38,030
哪曉得買這種東西  是陳太太的
It's Mrs. Chan's.

151
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,950
我先生從日本帶回來的
My husband brought it from Japan.

152
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,330
我看挺好  所以介紹給顧太太
I wanted to show Mrs. Koo how good it is.

153
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,580
跳起來了  跳起來了
Now it's ready.

154
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,950
這回真行了  你看多方便
It's workable, you can see.

155
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:57,060
陳太太
Mrs. Chan.

156
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:00,990
麻煩你陳先生  下次幫我帶一個回來
Could Mr.Chan get me one next time?

157
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:02,110
好  沒問題
No problem.

158
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:05,590
周先生  你也應該買上一個
Mr.Chow, you should get one too.

159
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:09,920
你太太老是值夜班  有了它就方便多了
Your wife's so often late home.

160
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,950
麻煩陳先生不太好意思
I couldn't trouble Mr.Chan.

161
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:15,270
隔壁鄰居  無所謂啦
It's just neighborly, isn't it?

162
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,990
不要緊  他過兩天會再去
It's no trouble.

163
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:20,270
我叫他多帶一個回來
I'll ask him to buy another next time.

164
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:21,880
那么多謝你了
Thank you.

165
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:33,810
來  我們嘗嘗
Let's try the rice.

166
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:38,660
真不好意思  要你老遠帶電飯鍋給我
Mr.Chan, sorry to trouble you about the rice cooker.

167
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:40,910
順手的嘛  用不著客氣
It was really no trouble.

168
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:44,430
還沒付錢你  該多少錢  
How much do I owe you?

169
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:45,990
你太太已經給我了
Your wife has already paid me.

170
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:47,840
是嗎  
Really?

171
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,010
她沒告訴你  
She didn't tell you?

172
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,550
她這陣子值夜班
She's been working late shifts.

173
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:53,220
等她回來我已經睡了
Often I'm asleep when she gets back.

174
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:55,680
在酒店做事也真辛苦
It must be hard for her.

175
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:56,730
是啊
Yes.

176
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:58,580
陳太太還沒回來  
Mrs. Chan isn't back yet?

177
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:01,820
我想她快回來了  你有事找她  
She'll be back soon, you need to talk to her?

178
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,900
我有個朋友過兩天去新加坡
A friend needs to go to Singapore.

179
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:07,700
想看看陳太太的公司有沒有  便宜點的船票
I wonder if she could get a cheap ticket for him.

180
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:09,360
等她回來我告訴她
I'll ask when she gets back.

181
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:11,970
麻煩你們不好意思
I'm bothering you too much.

182
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:15,990
客什么氣  大家隔壁鄰居  應該的
Don't mention it, we're neighbors.

183
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:17,880
那么我先回去了
I'll leave you in peace.

184
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,910
怎么  找我  
Looking for me?

185
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:29,310
打著鑼找呢  整個上午到哪兒去了  
Damn right, where've you been?

186
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:30,820
什么事呀  
What's up?

187
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:32,980
陳太太打電話來
Mrs. Chan called.

188
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:35,480
說你把帽子忘在她公司了
you left a hat at her office.

189
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,370
我故意的  不然哪有機會多看她兩眼
I meant to, I wanted an excuse to go back.

190
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:40,200
早知你會來這一手
I know your tricks.

191
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,430
人家可是有老公的
She's married.

192
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:45,170
我當然知道她有老公
I know.

193
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:46,960
要不我還回來干嘛
That's why I left,

194
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,730
干脆搬到你那兒去
otherwise I'd move in next door.

195
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:51,440
說真的  幸好你老婆也是美人
If your wife wasn't so attractive,

196
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,140
要不然我可要替她擔心
she'd be a worried woman.

197
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,800
你當我是你啊
I'm not like you.

198
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,760
幫我打電話約陳太太
Please call Mrs. Chan for me.

199
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:02,960
說我明天上她公司拿帽子
I'll pick up the hat tomorrow.

200
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:04,520
順便請她喝茶
And take her to lunch.

201
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:06,280
你想得美
Dream on, I asked her to

202
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,570
我跟她說了  把帽子先拿回家
take the hat home.

203
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:10,110
明早我幫你帶回來
I'll bring it in tomorrow.

204
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,340
真泄氣  還是老朋友呢
You're kidding, some buddy you are.

205
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,230
索性我跟你回家去
Tell you what, let's go pick up now.

206
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,700
這個鐘點應該下班了
She should be off work by now.

207
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:19,940
一塊兒接她下班去
We can go together.

208
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:21,650
懶得跟你講
I don't have time for this.

209
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:23,410
阿周
Chow.

210
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,920
來啦  快走吧  我還要忙
Yes, get out of here, I'm busy.

211
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,800
這樣吧  我先走  在家等你
Then I'll wait at your place.

212
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:29,940
就這么說定了
That's all.

213
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:31,970
炳  炳
Ping, Ping.

214
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,270
周先生  顧先生在不在  
Mr.Chow, is Mr.Koo in?

215
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:45,380
他出去了  又忘了買報紙了  
He's out, forgot to buy the paper again?

216
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,830
是  我待會兒再來
That's right, I'll stop by later.

217
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,320
-我幫你找找看  -謝謝你
- Maybe I can find it for you. - Thank you!

218
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,730
-是這一張嗎  -是的
- This one? - Yes.

219
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:06,810
我以前也常看的  一天不看就不自在
I always loved those serials, hated to miss an episode.

220
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:08,710
是嗎  你也喜歡看武俠小說  
Really? You like them too?

221
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:12,160
迷過一陣子  我還想過自己寫
I even thought of writing one.

222
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,950
為什么沒寫
Why didn't you?

223
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:17,120
想來想去開不了頭  也就算了
I couldn't get started, so I gave up.

224
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:19,410
注定不是干這一行的
I wasn't born to write martial arts stories.

225
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,960
那些武俠小說我都留著  要看你拿去
But you can borrow from my collection any time.

226
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:25,100
不了  下回再麻煩你  謝謝你
Not now, maybe another time, thanks.

227
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,030
不客氣
You're welcome.

228
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:35,560
什么事  陳太太  
What is it, Mrs. Chan?

229
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:38,760
這些書還給周先生的  他在不在家  
I just want to return these to Mr.Chow is he in?

230
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:40,610
他好幾天沒回來
He's been away for a few days.

231
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,010
怎么回事  
Why?

232
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,290
兩夫妻吵架了
They had a quarrel.

233
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:48,000
你把書擱下吧  等周先生回來
Leave them with me.

234
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,510
我幫你還給他
I'll pass them back to him.

235
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:50,860
謝謝
Thank you!

236
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:01,090
不用了
Forget it.

237
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,740
今晚我值夜班
I'm on a replacement shift tonight.

238
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:05,550
你先回去吧
Talk to you later.

239
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:14,020
再說吧  今晚我會遲一點  你不用來接我了
No need to pick me up.

240
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:18,500
她已經走啦
She's already left.

241
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:22,910
是嗎  還想接她一塊吃夜宵
Really? I was going to take her out for supper.

242
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:26,590
她沒告訴你嗎  她今天早下班
Didn't she tell you she was off early today.

243
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:29,860
她老是這樣  顛三倒四的
She never remembers to tell me.

244
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,520
說不定已經回到家里了
Maybe she's home by now.

245
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:34,970
那我先走了
I'll be off, then.

246
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,650
好的  再見
Okay, bye!

247
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,070
你好
Hello!

248
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,280
你出院了嗎  
You're out of hospital?

249
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:19,230
先別說了  借我三十塊
Don't mention hospital, lend me $30.

250
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,320
干什么  
What for?

251
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,930
幫幫忙  名譽攸關
You gotta help me save face.

252
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:23,990
出了什么大事  
What's the big deal?

253
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:26,990
還不是那個阿海  那天來醫院看我
It's Ah Hoi's fault.

254
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,910
說有內幕消息  穩贏的
He gave me a racing tip, said it was a sure thing.

255
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,090
我看他那么有把握  線都來不及拆
Before they'd taken out the stitches.

256
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:35,470
一股勁跑出醫院  趕去馬場
I rushed from hospital to Race Course.

257
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:36,820
把老婆本都押上了
I bet everything I had

258
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,200
結果輸了個精光
and I lost my shirt.

259
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:40,800
活該  剛開完刀還要去賭
What did you expect?

260
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,800
我想負傷上陣  必有大運
I thought it was my lucky day.

261
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,230
誰知輸剩兩塊錢
Anyhow, I had only $2 left.

262
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:49,690
賭氣就跑去找貴妃
So I went to the whorehouse.

263
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,870
病到這樣子你還要去玩女人啊  
You were in no shape for sex.

264
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,580
想沖沖喜嘛
I thought it would improve for sex.

265
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:58,870
不是只剩兩塊錢  夠嗎  
What would $2 buy you?

266
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,190
我是常客  好商量  先賒著也可以的
I'm Kwai Fei's regular, she gives me credit.

267
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:05,640
這種事情也可以賒賬  
You can have in on credit?

268
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:06,890
把身份證押給她
I left my ID card and

269
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:09,210
說好兩三天后回去拿
said I'd be back to redeem it.

270
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:11,410
原以為這么一點錢很容易
I thought a few dollars would be back easy to rustle up.

271
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:13,950
誰知到現在還沒搞定  還過了期
But so far nothing. I'm way overdue.

272
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:15,200
那怎辦  
So?

273
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,100
怎辦  昨兒小四上去
Four Eyes was there yesterday.

274
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:19,150
可不就看見她拿著我那張身份證
Saw her waving my ID around in

275
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:20,190
到處讓人看
front of everyone.

276
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:21,170
你說衰不衰啊  
So embarrassing?

277
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,910
先別說了  給我三十塊
Anyway, lend me $30.

278
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:30,950
我只有那么多
This is all can spare.

279
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:34,990
留十塊  這些你拿去用
I need $10 for myself.

280
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:38,740
月初就還你
Pay you back next month.

281
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,630
-去吃宵夜  -還要吃宵夜  
- Let's have a late snack. - What?

282
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:45,040
一整天就吃了一碗云吞面  都快餓死了
All I've had today is some won-ton noodles.

283
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,050
等我寫好這一段吧
Let me finish writing this first.

284
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:53,050
有件事  我不知道要不要跟你說
I'm not sure I should tell you this.

285
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:54,370
什么事  
What?

286
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,540
昨天在街上看見你老婆
I saw your wife in the street yesterday.

287
00:18:57,910 --> 00:18:58,860
這有什么好奇怪的  
So what?

288
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:01,980
奇怪倒不奇怪
That is nothing,

289
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,650
不過她好像跟一個男人走在一起
but she was with some guy.

290
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,710
可能是她朋友
Probably a friend.

291
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:14,560
說得也對  我不過是隨便說說而已
Just thought you should know.

292
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:20,070
余小姐嗎  我是蘇秘書啊
Miss Yu? This is me.

293
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,820
何先生還在談事情
Mr.Ho's still in a meeting.

294
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,910
他說晚上恐怕不能跟你吃飯
he says he can't manage dinner.

295
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:28,820
是  我們這陣子很忙
Yes, we're very busy now.

296
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:37,330
好的  我會跟他說  再見
I'll, I'll ask Mr.Ho to call.

不如  到我家吃頓便飯

問他有沒有問題

00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:54,950
何太太打過電話來
Your wife rang,

339
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:56,980
說用不著回家去接她
you don't need to pick her up.

340
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:58,660
她在跟劉太太打牌

342
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,560
余小姐有一份禮物交給你
and there's a gift from Miss Yu.

343
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:08,050
她上來過  
She was here?

344
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,830
不  她找人送上來的
No, she had it sent over.

345
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:12,600
她說知道你今天生日  應酬多
She says she'll dine alone since it's your birthday.

346
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,710
所以不找你吃飯了
Please phone her

347
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:15,580
叫你有空再給她電話
when you have a moment.

348
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:20,870
-我幫你倒杯咖啡  -謝謝

領帶很漂亮
That tie looks good on you.

351

你看得出我換了領帶嗎  
You noticed?

352
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:57,420
我還以為差不多
It's much like the old one.

353
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,550
仔細看能看出來
You notice things if you pay attention.

354
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:14,980
我先走了
I'll be off now.

355
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:16,630
如果陳先生那邊有問題
If Chan has a problem,

356
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,670
打電話到天香樓找我
let me know at the restaurant.

357
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:20,460
怎么把領帶又換了  
Why did you change your tie?

358
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,420
我嫌那條太花俏了點兒
The new one was too showy.

359
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:24,200
還是換回原來的好
I should stick with my own.

360
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:25,620
記得鎖門啊
Don't forget to lock up.

361
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,990
對了  最近很少看見你先生
By the way, haven't seen your husband lately.

362
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:19,530
是呀  這陣子他公司有事  派了他出去
He's abroad now, on company business.

363
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,960
怪不得老在面攤碰見你
That's why I see you at the noodle stall.

364
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:25,520
一個人懶得煮飯
I don't like cooking for myself.

365
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:29,360
對了  你太太呢  最近也很少看見她
Haven't seen your wife lately either.

366
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:33,650
她媽媽身體不太舒服  回娘家陪陪她
Her mother's ill, she's at home with her.

367
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:35,980
難怪了
That explains it.

368
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:39,990
-晚安  -晚安
- Good night! - Good night!

369
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:42,650
陳太太  你回來就好了
Mrs. Chan, I'm glad you're back.

370
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,390
外面雨下得那么兇
It's raining so hard.

371
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:46,860
我還想打傘去接你呢
I was going to look for you with and umbrella.

372
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,370
不過是陣頭雨  你有心
You are too kind.

373
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,250
王媽  是誰  
Amah, who is it?

374
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:50,600
是陳太太
It's Mrs. Chan.

375
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:51,520
孫太太
Mrs. Suen.

376
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:53,700
哎呀  下那么大雨還出去呀
Caught in the rain? I said you could

377
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:56,890
大家自己人  早叫你一道吃
eat with us.

378
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,250
下回吧  慢慢打
Next time, Enjoy your game.

379
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:03,940
哎呀  她先生一天到晚在外頭
Her husband's always away.

380
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:06,680
她一個人孤伶伶怪可憐的
It's sad to see her to lonely.

381
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,220
出去買碗面  還穿得真漂亮
She dresses up like that to go out for noodle.

382
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:23,810
周先生  怎么到這邊來了  
Mr.Chow, What are you doing here?

383
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:26,360
我過來叫顧太太聽電話
Just calling Mrs. Koo to the phone.

384
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:29,280
這么晚  
You're late back.

385
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:31,280
剛看了場電影
I went to the picture.

386
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:33,860
我先回去了
I'll be going.

387
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,460
喂
Hello!

388
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:44,660

Yes, please hold on.

389
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:47,220
-是誰的電話  -陳太太的電話
- Who is it? - It's for Mrs. Chan.

390
00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:01,410
那么冒昧約你出來  是有點事想請教你
It must seem odd to ask you, out but I want to ask something.

391
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,330
你今天下午拿著的皮包
That handbag I saw you with this evening.

392
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:05,930
不知道哪里有的買  
Where did you buy it?

393
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,680
你為什么這樣問  
Why do you ask?

394
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:12,540
哦  我看款式很別致
It looked so elegant.

395
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:14,060
想買一個送給我太太
I want to get one for my wife.

396
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:19,580
周先生對太太真細心
Mr.Chow, you're so good to your wife.

397
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:24,020
那里  她這人很挑剔
Not really, my wife is so fussy.

398
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,560
過兩天她生日
Her birthday is two days away.

399
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:27,130
不知道買什么送給她才好
I don't know what to get her.

400
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,330
你可不可以幫我買一個  
Could you buy one for me to give her?

401
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:38,690
要是一模一樣的  她會不喜歡吧
Maybe she wouldn't want one just exactly the same.

402
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,190
說的也是  我倒也沒想到
You're right, I didn't think of that.

403
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:46,120
女人會介意  對吧  
Women would mind.

404
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,990
會的  特別是隔壁鄰居
Yes, especially since we're neighbors.

405
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:53,860
不知道會不會有別的顏色
Do they come in other colors?

406
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:58,710
那要問我先生才知道
I'd have to ask my husband.

407
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:00,660
為什么  
Why?

408
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:02,470
那皮包是我先生
He bought it for me

409
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:04,400
在外地工作的時候買給我的
on a business trip abroad.

410
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:06,820
他說在香港沒有賣的
They aren't on sale here.

411
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:12,140
那就算了吧
Then never mind.

412
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:20,530
其實
Actually.

413
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,260
我也有一件事情想請教你
I want to ask your something too.

414
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:25,880
什么事  
What?

415
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:29,060
你的領帶在哪里買的  
Where did you buy your tie?

416
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,220
我還真的不知道
I don't know where it came from.

417
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:36,000
我領帶全是我太太幫我買的
My wife buys all my ties.

418
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:37,540
是嗎  
Really?

419
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:44,510
我想起來了  有一次她公司派她出去
She bought this one

420
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:45,500
回來送給我的
on a business trip abroad.

421
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:47,760
她說香港沒有賣的
It's not on sale here.

422
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:50,860
倒有這么巧
What a coincidence!

423
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:54,790
是啊
Yes.

424
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:01,680
其實
Actually.

425
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:07,040
我先生也有條領帶跟你的一模一樣
My husband has one just like it.

426
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,580
他說是他老板送他的
He said it was a gift from his boss.

427
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:12,730
所以天天戴著
So he wears it every day.

428
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:20,240
我太太也有個皮包跟你那個一模一樣
Any my wife has a bag just like yours.

429
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,660
我知道  我見過
I know, I have seen it.

430
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,310
你想說什么
What are you getting at, actually?

431
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,000
我還以為只有我一個人知道
I thought I was the only one who knew.

432
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,130
不知道他們是怎樣開始的
I wonder how it began.

433
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:24,060
你這么晚不回家  你老婆不說你嗎  
It's late, won't your wife complain?

434
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,890
早習慣了  她不管我的
She's used to it, she doesn't care.

435
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:32,000
你呢  你老公不說什么嗎  
And your husband?

436
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,270
我想他早睡了
He must be asleep by now.

437
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:39,830
今晚別回去了
Shall we stay out tonight?

438
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:49,290
我老公不會這樣講的
My husband would never say that.

439
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:53,860
他會怎么講
What would he say?

440
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:56,260
就是不會講
Anyhow, he wouldn't say that.

441
00:31:58,150 --> 00:31:59,390
總有一個人先開口吧
Someone must have made the first move.

442
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:02,140
不是他是誰  
Who else could it be?

443
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:10,730
你這么晚不回家  你老婆不會問嗎  
It's late, won't your wife complain?

444
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:13,880
早習慣了  她不管的
She's used to it, she doesn't care.

445
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,800
你老公不會說什么嗎  
And your husband?

446
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,550
我想他早睡了
He must be asleep by now.

447
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,900
我真的說不出口
I can't say it.

448
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:48,790
我明白
I understand.

449
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,300
事到如今
After all, it's already happened.

450
00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:55,520
誰先開口有什么所謂
It doesn't matter who made the first move.

451
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,580
其實你知不知道你老婆是怎樣的人
Do you really know your wife?

452
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:34,300
你幫我點
You order for me.

453
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:35,830
為什么  
Why?

454
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,770
我想知道你老婆喜歡吃什么
I've no idea what your wife likes.

455
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,240
那么你丈夫喜歡吃什么
What about your husband?

456
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:37,210
吃得慣嗎  
Like it hot?

457
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:42,910
你老婆挺能吃辣的
Your wife likes hot dishes.

458
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,730
為什么打電話到我公司  
Why did you call me at the office today?

459
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,700
沒事做  想聽聽你的聲音
I had nothing to do, I want to hear your voice.

460
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:28,520
學得倒挺像我老公
You have my husband down pat.

461
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:30,160
油嘴滑舌
He's real sweet-talker.

462
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:59,140
你為什么不打電話給我  
Why didn't you call me today?

463
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:01,950
怕你會不高興
I was afraid you won't like it.

464
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,110
那么以后不要再打電話給我
Then don't call me again.

465
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:26,660
陳太太  陳先生有封信來了  你看看
Mrs. Chan, a letter from your husband.

466
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:30,160
不是我的  是隔壁周先生的
It's not for me, it's for Mr.Chow next door.

467
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,770
我看見信封上的日本郵票
The Japanese stamp made me think

468
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,370
以為是陳先生寄來
it was your husband.

469
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:36,680
原來不是
So I was wrong.

470
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:54,860
你老婆去了日本  
Your wife's in Japan?

471
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:58,380
你怎么知道
How did you know?

472
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:02,270
信里寫些什么  
What did she say in her letter?

473
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:04,380
沒什么
Nothing special.

474
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:08,260
有沒有說幾時回來  
Anything about when she'd be back?

475
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:11,350
沒有
No.

476
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:14,370
你猜他們現在在做什么  
What do you think they're doing right now?

477
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:53,340
-你沒事吧  -沒事
- Are you alright? - I'm fine.

478
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,270
麻煩你在前面停停車
Please pull up here.

479
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:57,990
干什么  
Why?

480
00:37:58,670 --> 00:37:59,990
我先下車
I'll get off first.

481
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:02,900
不好  我先下
No, let me.

482
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:08,480
-陳太太  -炳哥  你回來了  
- Mrs. Chan. - Ah Ping, you're back.

483
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:10,210
-是啊  -找周先生  
- Visiting. - Mr.Chow?

484
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:13,160
想找他喝茶  哪知道他病了
Yes, I thought we'd have lunch but he isn't well.

485
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,360
怎么回事  
What's wrong with him?

486
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:16,750
發燒  他老婆又不在家
He's got fever, he's all alone.

487
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:19,900
一個人怪可憐的  下去給他買點什么吃
So I'm gonna buy him something to eat.

488
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,830
街口那家店  賣的粥挺好的
The congee downstairs is quite good.

489
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:23,210
他不想吃粥
He doesn't want congee.

490
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:24,990
他想吃什么
What does he want?

491
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:27,870
他說嘴里淡得慌  想吃芝麻糊
Can't taste anything, so he wants sesame syrup.

492
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:29,120
真難纏
Damned troublesome.

493
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,160
王媽  王媽
Amah.

494
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,990
孫太太  王媽上天臺晾衣服去了
Mrs. Suen, she's hanging the washing on the roof.

495
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:41,270
你回來了
You're back.

496
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:42,990
這是剛上街回來  
Yes, you've been out?

497
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:46,610
是呀  下禮拜我媽過生日
My mother's birthday is coming up.

498
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:48,700
我帶她去買點布料做新衣
So I took her to buy some fabric.

499
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:50,770
跑了一整天  氣都喘不上來了
It took all day, I'm half dead.

500
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,790
順道燙了個頭發  好看嗎  
And I had my hair done, is it nice?

501
00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:54,720
很漂亮
Very nice!

502
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,530
你在煮什么  
What are you cooking?

503
00:39:57,650 --> 00:39:59,520
忽然想吃芝麻糊
I had a sudden craving for sesame syrup.

504
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:03,010
一大鍋你怎么吃呀
That whole pot is for you.

505
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:06,000
反正煮了  大家一塊吃吧
I thought I might as well make a potful.

506
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:08,460
你真客氣
You're so thoughtful.

507
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,990
-來一碗吧  -好啊
- Please try it. - I'll.

508
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:13,490
這么巧
What a coincidence.

509
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:15,130
是啊  上街嗎  
Going out?

510
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:18,990
整晚沒吃過東西了  下來吃碗面
I'll buy some noodles, I'm starving.

511
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:21,210
你餓不餓  一起啊  
Hungary? Will you join me?

512
00:40:21,650 --> 00:40:22,720
不了
No thanks.

513
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:25,110
這么晚才下班  
Just off work?

514
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:26,780
公司很忙  
You must be very busy.

515
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:30,810
就是沒事做  所以看了場電影
Actually, I've been to see a picture.

516
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,340
是嗎  好不好看  
Really? How was it?

517
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:35,100
馬馬虎虎
So-so.

518
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:36,930
我從前也愛看電影
I used to like going to the pictures.

519
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:39,360
你以前倒是挺多嗜好的
You had many hobbies before.

520
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:43,170
自己一個人  大把時間  想做什么就做什么
On your own, you are free to do lots of things.

521
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:45,270
結了婚就不一樣
Everything changes when you marry.

522
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:47,670
很多事情  一個人作不了主
It must be decided together.

523
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:49,160
對不對  
Right?

524
00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:54,000
有時候我會想  要是現在還沒有結婚
I sometimes wonder what I'd be.

525
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:54,990
不知會怎樣
if I hadn't married.

526
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:56,890
你也會這樣想嗎  
Have you ever thought of that?

527
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:01,830
可能會比較開心吧
Maybe happier.

528
00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:06,730
我以前都沒有想到婚姻
I didn't know married life would be.

529
00:41:06,770 --> 00:41:08,230
是這樣復雜
so complicated.

530
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:13,300
如果一個人  自己做得好就夠了
When you're single, you are only responsible to yourself

531
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:16,510
可是當兩個人在一起時
Once you're married,

532
00:41:17,090 --> 00:41:19,140
只有自己做得好是不夠的
doing well on your own is not enough.

533
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:25,990
別想太多了  等他們回來再說吧
Don't brood on it, maybe he'll be back soon.

534
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:31,080
你沒事啊  
What about you?

535
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,110
其實我跟你還不是一樣
Actually, we're in the same boat.

536
00:41:36,610 --> 00:41:37,990
我只是不去想
But I don't brood on it.

537
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:40,890
又不是我做錯
It's not my fault.

538
00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:44,150
何必每天問自己做錯了什么
I can't waste time wondering if I made mistakes.

539
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,420
浪費自己時間
Life's too short for that.

540
00:41:48,330 --> 00:41:49,540
我不想這樣下去
Something must change.

541
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,760
你有什么打算  
So what's your plan?

542
00:41:54,790 --> 00:41:57,250
這幾天我躺在床上翻武俠小說
I want to write a martial-arts

543
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,270
我想再寫  
serial...

544
00:41:58,410 --> 00:42:01,580
已經開了頭  過兩天讓你看
Actually, I've started one, I'll show it to you.

545
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:03,540
好啊
Great!

546
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:05,950
你這么喜歡看武俠小說
You like them too.

547
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
我們一起寫吧
so why not help me write it?

548
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:11,120
這怎么行  我只會看  哪里會寫
I wouldn't know how, I only read them.

549
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:12,930
試試看嘛
We would discuss it together.

550
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,680
那好吧  我盡量
Alright, I'll try my best.

551
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:20,000
還沒多謝你的芝麻糊呢
I never thanked you for the sesame syrup.

552
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:24,150
別客氣  小意思嘛
There's no need I was making it anyway.

553
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:26,750
說起來真巧
Amazing, I was craving for some

554
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,940
剛好那天我很想吃芝麻糊
sesame syrup that day.

555
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:31,190
是嗎  這么巧
Really? What's a coincidence.

556
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:33,520
是呀  就這么巧
It really was.

557
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:36,880
我先去吃點東西
I'll go for those noodles.

558
00:45:01,970 --> 00:45:04,120
老是這樣子  酒席吃到一半就醉倒
Again, halfway through dinner, he's drunk.

559
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:05,550
真討厭
Disgusting!

560
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:13,670
-早說別給他喝了  -我有啥辦法
- I told you to stop. - What can you do?

561
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:19,550
是我
It's me.

562
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:21,360
嚇死我了
You scared me.

563
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,240
怎樣  顧先生有沒有事  
How's Mr.Koo?

564
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
喝醉了吧
Drunk, as usual.

565
00:45:34,790 --> 00:45:35,890
怎會這樣早
I didn't expect them back so early.

566
00:45:38,550 --> 00:45:41,770
反正沒法子  不如先把面吃完再說
Since you're trapped here, finish the noodles.

567
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:46,930
我想他們坐一會兒就走
They'll probably go soon.

568
00:45:58,700 --> 00:45:59,610
加點湯嗎  
Want some soup?

569
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:04,420
要不要加點湯  
Want some soup?

570
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:18,590
孫太太  怎么在這邊打麻將  
Mrs. Suen, playing here tonight.

571
00:46:19,690 --> 00:46:21,980
顧太太說要看著她先生嘛
Yes, Mrs. Koo is dealing with her husband.

572
00:46:22,870 --> 00:46:25,310
早跟我說嘛  我來照顧他就行了
I could do that.

573
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:26,930
怎好意思呀
No, we should not trouble you.

574
00:46:29,170 --> 00:46:30,920
這樣高興  看來要玩到天亮
Think you'll play all night?

575
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:34,370
才不會  頂多八圈
No, we'll just play eight rounds.

576
00:46:39,150 --> 00:46:40,580
你猜他們會不會打到天亮  
They'll play till morning?

577
00:46:41,530 --> 00:46:42,920
孫太太說只打八圈
Mrs. Suen says only eight rounds.

578
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:45,250
你信不信  
You believe that?

579
00:46:51,550 --> 00:46:54,720
不如你瞌睡一會  他們散了我就叫你
You get some rest, I'll wake you when they leave.

580
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:56,770
那你呢  
And you?

581
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:58,650
我先把這段寫好
I have a chapter to finish.

582
00:47:12,850 --> 00:47:14,110
寫到哪兒  
Where have you got to?

583
00:47:14,890 --> 00:47:15,940
大醉俠出場
The drunken master just showed up.

584
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:18,280
怎么多了個大醉俠  
When did he get written in?

585
00:47:19,450 --> 00:47:20,700
剛想到的
Just now.

586
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:46,480
周先生  這樣早就出去啊
Mr.Chow, home so early?

587
00:47:46,690 --> 00:47:48,370
我下去買點吃的
I went out to buy some food.

588
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:49,610
你今天不用上班嗎  
No work today?

589
00:47:49,730 --> 00:47:51,450
有點不太舒服  告了一天假
I didn't feel so good, I'm staying home.

590
00:47:51,590 --> 00:47:53,660
不舒服還吃這么多糯米雞
A sick man shouldn't eat all that sticky rice.

591
00:47:53,890 --> 00:47:55,700
省得晚上再出去買
Some of it's for later.

592
00:47:55,870 --> 00:47:57,800
當心吃撐了
Don't stuff yourself.

593
00:47:58,820 --> 00:47:59,320
周先生
Good morning.

594
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:00,940
你早  散場了嗎  孫太太  
Good morning, finished your game?

595
00:48:00,990 --> 00:48:04,760
沒有呢  楊先生要辦公  讓他先走了
Not yet, but Mr.Yang has to work.

596
00:48:04,850 --> 00:48:06,820
不過蔡先生馬上就來
Mr.Tsai is coming to replace him.

597
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:09,870
有沒有幫我打電話回公司請假  
Did you call the office for me?

598
00:48:10,890 --> 00:48:11,680
打過了
Yes.

599
00:48:11,850 --> 00:48:12,760
你怎么說的
What did you tell them?

600
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:14,740
說你病了
That you weren't feeling well.

601
00:48:16,890 --> 00:48:18,200
他們有沒有問你是誰
Did them ask who you were?

602
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:19,620
沒有
No.

603
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:24,650
多半以為我是你丈夫吧
Probably took me for your husband.

604
00:48:25,990 --> 00:48:28,120
何先生知道他出門了
Mr.Ho knows that he's away.

605
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:30,700
就說他已經回來好了
Pretend he's come back.

606
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:41,170
都是自己嚇自己
Maybe we're being too cautious?

607
00:48:41,930 --> 00:48:43,340
平日我也常過來
I'm always round anyway.

608
00:48:43,990 --> 00:48:45,180
有什么好緊張的
We shouldn't have panicked.

609
00:48:47,710 --> 00:48:50,830
這很難說  他們突然之間回來
Well, they did turn up without warning.

610
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:52,450
不知道他們會怎么亂想
What would they assume?

611
00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:57,600
所以真的不能走錯一步
We can't put a foot wrong.

612
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:38,520
走吧
You can go.

613
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:06,400
-王媽  -陳太太  怎么這樣晚  
- Amah. - Mrs. Chan, you're back very late.

614
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,640
是呀  今天公司事情多
I had a lot of work today.

615
00:50:09,070 --> 00:50:11,540
怎么今早沒看見你上班  
I didn't see you leave this morning.

616
00:50:11,770 --> 00:50:13,860
今天很早約了媽媽喝茶
I had breakfast with my mother.

617
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:15,550
我出去的時候你還沒來
You weren't here when I left.

618
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:18,580
孫太太呢  
Where's Mrs. Suen?

619
00:50:18,990 --> 00:50:22,290
她搓麻將搓到天亮  才剛睡
Asleep, she played mahjong all day.

620
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:24,590
-別吵她了  -好的
- Be quiet, don't wake her. - Alright.

621
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:27,300
呀  陳太太  你的腳還好吧
Mrs. Chan, is your leg alright?

622
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:29,610
沒什么  新鞋子太窄  擠腳了
It's these new shoes.

623
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:17,240
干嘛請我吃飯  
Why a special dinner tonight?

624
00:51:18,070 --> 00:51:21,090
今天出稿費  你那一份你又不收
Since you won't take your share of

625
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:22,460
只好請你吃飯了
the writing fee.

626
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:24,690
其實不關我的事
None of my business.

627
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:26,250
我在旁邊打打邊鼓而已
All I did was give you some thoughts.

628
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:29,100
我也許會多寫一家報紙
Someone else is asking for a serial too.

629
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:31,420
今天有人打電話來約稿
There'll be more work soon.

630
00:51:31,650 --> 00:51:34,330
是嗎  那太好了
Really? So quickly.

631
00:51:34,430 --> 00:51:35,520
你應付得了嗎  
Isn't the workload too much?

632
00:51:36,030 --> 00:51:37,690
所以想找一個地方
That's why I'm looking for a new place.

633
00:51:39,290 --> 00:51:40,330
做什么  
What for?

634
00:51:41,580 --> 00:51:42,850
寫東西
To write in,

635
00:51:44,450 --> 00:51:46,140
這樣你以后上來都方便點嘛
it'll be more convenient.

636
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:48,760
雖然我們之間沒什么
There's nothing between us,

637
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:50,790
但是我不想別人誤會你
but I don't want gossip.

638
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:53,990
你覺得怎樣  
What do you think?

639
00:51:55,530 --> 00:51:57,450
太浪費了
Why waste money?

640
00:51:58,140 --> 00:51:59,950
其實都是你自己寫的
You don't need me,

641
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:02,270
何必多此一舉呢
you can write on your own.

642
00:52:42,170 --> 00:52:43,960
喂  找誰呀  
Who do you want?

643
00:52:44,270 --> 00:52:45,570
周慕云  
Chow Mo-Wan?

644
00:52:46,470 --> 00:52:47,790
他沒上班好幾天了
He hasn't been in for several days.

645
00:52:51,150 --> 00:52:53,340
我們也到處在找他
We're looking for him too.

646
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:57,550
你是哪位啊  
May I know who's calling?

647
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:01,810
要留個話嗎  
Any message?

648
00:53:03,270 --> 00:53:05,860
哦  不用謝  多掛來啊
It's no trouble, goodbye.

649
00:53:18,430 --> 00:53:20,520
這文件馬上送去會計部
Please get this to Accounts.

650
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:22,520
還有  冷氣機明天叫人來看看
And have the air-conditioner serviced tomorrow.

651
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:24,400
好  何先生
Mr.Ho.

652
00:53:26,170 --> 00:53:28,000
沒什么事了  你可以走了
No need to stay if everything's done.

653
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:30,100
-門我來鎖嘍  -好的
- I'll lock up. - Yes.

654
00:53:41,810 --> 00:53:42,410
喂
Hello?

655
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:49,850
你在哪里啊  
Where are you?

656
00:54:54,220 --> 00:54:55,600
我明天再來看你
I'll come again tomorrow.

657
00:54:56,550 --> 00:54:58,290
我歇兩天就沒事
No need, I'll be alright after some rest.

658
00:54:59,870 --> 00:55:01,690
不要緊  才一會兒功夫
It's no trouble.

659
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:04,620
我給你買點吃的  你想吃什么
I'll bring you some food, what would you like?

660
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:06,310
隨便
Whatever.

661
00:55:07,150 --> 00:55:10,190
那我就走了  你早點休息
Then I'll leave now, get some rest.

662
00:55:10,510 --> 00:55:11,950
回去給我個電話
Call me when you get home.

663
00:55:12,610 --> 00:55:15,520
用不著說話  響三聲就好
Let it ring three times then hang up.

664
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:17,790
好
Alright.

665
00:55:25,010 --> 00:55:26,320
我沒想過你會來
I didn't think you'd come.

666
00:55:30,550 --> 00:55:32,480
我們不會跟他們一樣的
We won't be like them.

667
00:55:34,730 --> 00:55:35,510
明天見
See you tomorrow.

668
00:57:51,910 --> 00:57:53,610
你老實告訴我
Tell me honestly.

669
00:57:56,260 --> 00:57:57,970
你外面是不是有個女人  
Do you have a mistress?

670
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:01,990
神經病
You're crazy.

671
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:06,510
誰跟你說的
Who told you I had?

672
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:08,330
你別管
Never mind who.

673
00:58:09,630 --> 00:58:11,110
你是不是有了個女人
Do you or don't you?

674
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:14,930
沒有
No.

675
00:58:20,890 --> 00:58:22,140
不要騙我
Don't lie.

676
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:28,240
你看著我  你看著我
Look at me.

677
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:32,620
我問你  你外面是不是有個女人  
I'm asking you, do you have a mistress.

678
00:58:37,830 --> 00:58:38,580
是
Yes.

679
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:46,190
你怎么了  
That's no reaction.

680
00:58:47,390 --> 00:58:49,940
他已經承認在外面有個女人
If he admits it outright,

681
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:52,510
你還打得這么輕
let him have it.

682
00:58:55,530 --> 00:58:57,750
我沒想到他會回答得這樣干脆
I wasn't expecting he would admit it so easily.

683
00:58:59,630 --> 00:59:01,180
我不知道該怎么辦
I didn't know how to react.

684
00:59:04,010 --> 00:59:05,120
再來一次吧
One more time, alright?

685
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,910
你老實回答我
Tell me frankly.

686
00:59:26,180 --> 00:59:27,700
你外面是不是有個女人  
Do you have a mistress?

687
00:59:31,890 --> 00:59:32,770
神經病
You're crazy.

688
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:39,770
誰跟你說的  
Who told you that?

689
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:44,990
你別管  你是不是有個女人  
Never mind that, do you or don't you?

690
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:51,480
沒有
No.

691
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:55,690
你不要騙我
Don't lie.

692
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:57,630
你告訴我
Tell me.

693
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:02,680
你看著我  是不是有個女人  
Look at me, do you have a mistress?

694
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:13,470
是
Yes.

695
01:00:40,310 --> 01:00:41,220
你沒事吧
Are you alright?

696
01:00:45,370 --> 01:00:47,440
我沒想到真的會這樣傷心
I didn't expect it to hurt so much.

697
01:00:57,300 --> 01:01:00,260
我試試而已  又不是真的
This is just a rehearsal.

698
01:01:03,110 --> 01:01:04,520
就算是真的他也不會認
He won't really admit it so readily.

699
01:01:05,820 --> 01:01:09,180
沒事的  別這樣
It's alright, don't take it so hard.

700
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:15,460
你最近好像應酬挺多的  
You've been out a lot lately

701
01:01:16,380 --> 01:01:17,340
是啊
Yes.

702
01:01:20,010 --> 01:01:23,320
年紀輕呢  出去散散心是應該的
It's right to enjoy yourself while you're young.

703
01:01:24,690 --> 01:01:25,760
不過得有分寸
But don't overdo it.

704
01:01:29,610 --> 01:01:30,760
你先生幾時回來  
When will your husband be back?

705
01:01:31,990 --> 01:01:32,980
他快回來了
Soon.

706
01:01:35,550 --> 01:01:39,000
等他回來呢  別再讓他老出門
In future, don't let him travel so much.

707
01:01:40,010 --> 01:01:42,920
兩夫妻經常分開呢  總不大好
A couple should spend time together.

708
01:01:44,230 --> 01:01:45,370
你說對嗎  
Don't you agree?

709
01:01:48,130 --> 01:01:49,120
晚安
Good night!

710
01:02:11,030 --> 01:02:12,100
你今天晚上過不過來  
Will you come over tonight?

711
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:13,920
做什么  
What for?

712
01:02:14,580 --> 01:02:16,460
這兩天給催稿  說我寫得慢
The editor's hounding me, he says I'm too slow.

713
01:02:17,380 --> 01:02:19,260
過來幫忙手啊  你幾點可以  
I need your help, when can you come?

714
01:02:20,930 --> 01:02:22,810
我想這陣子我不過來了
Not anytime soon.

715
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:24,550
怎么了  
Why not?

716
01:02:25,770 --> 01:02:27,990
昨晚回家  讓孫太太說了幾句
Mrs. Suen lectured me last night.

717
01:02:29,070 --> 01:02:29,860
她說你什么
What did he say?

718
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:31,660
我不想講
Rather not say.

719
01:02:32,830 --> 01:02:34,740
反正這陣子我們還是少點見面吧
We shouldn't see so much of each other.

720
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:48,710
陳太太  又要去買面啊  
Mrs. Chan, going out for noodles again?

721
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:50,200
今天不去了
Not tonight, I'll make myself something.

722
01:02:51,150 --> 01:02:52,500
隨便弄點什么吃的就算了
Join us, we're having vegetable won-tons.

723
01:03:00,590 --> 01:03:01,540
那好的
Alright.

724
01:05:33,290 --> 01:05:35,200
-何先生沒出去吃午飯  -沒有
- No lunch today, Mr.Ho? - No.

725
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:38,650
剛才有位周先生打電話找你
Now one Mr.Zhou call you.

726
01:05:39,570 --> 01:05:40,620
叫你回電話給他
He wants you to call him back.

727
01:05:44,490 --> 01:05:45,330
謝謝
Thank you.

728
01:06:18,270 --> 01:06:20,140
-下班啦  -是呀
- Back from work? - Yes.

729
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:24,910
-這真是大雨呀  -是呀
- Strange weather, isn't it. - Yes.

730
01:06:25,700 --> 01:06:26,570
在這兒站很久了  
Been here long?

731
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:28,070
一會兒罷了
Just a while.

732
01:06:31,250 --> 01:06:32,280
我想還得下好一會兒
I don't think it'll stop soon.

733
01:06:35,300 --> 01:06:36,130
你等等我
Wait for me.

734
01:07:05,100 --> 01:07:06,060
我送你回去
I'll see you home.

735
01:07:07,320 --> 01:07:10,350
讓人看見  又話多了
We'd better not be seen together.

736
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:13,430
那么你先回去
Then you go first.

737
01:07:16,290 --> 01:07:17,560
他們認得你的傘
If they see your umbrella.

738
01:07:18,140 --> 01:07:20,610
我撐著回去  不也一樣  
They'll know I was with you.

739
01:07:22,970 --> 01:07:24,320
這也是  我倒沒想到
I wasn't thinking.

740
01:07:28,190 --> 01:07:31,340
你先回去吧  我待一會兒就回
You go first, I'll wait a while.

741
01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:34,320
我陪你
I'll keep you company.

742
01:07:57,330 --> 01:07:58,210
你找過我  
Did you try to call me?

743
01:08:01,010 --> 01:08:02,600
還以為你同事忘了告訴你
I wasn't sure you got the message.

744
01:08:04,510 --> 01:08:05,420
想找你買張船票
Could you get me a boat ticker?

745
01:08:08,690 --> 01:08:09,680
你要去別的地方  
To where?

746
01:08:11,820 --> 01:08:12,810
阿炳來過很多信
Ah Ping wrote from Singapore.

747
01:08:14,450 --> 01:08:17,800
說那邊缺人手  要我去幫他忙
They're short of staff, he'd like me to go and help.

748
01:08:22,210 --> 01:08:23,120
打算去多久  
How long will you stay?

749
01:08:24,220 --> 01:08:26,290
不知道  去了再說吧
Don't know, I'll play it be ear.

750
01:08:31,770 --> 01:08:33,650
怎么突然會想去新加坡  
Why rush off to Singapore?

751
01:08:35,780 --> 01:08:36,690
想換一下環境...
A change of scene...

752
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:40,670
免得聽著太多的閑言閑語
I've had enough of the gossip.

753
01:08:43,130 --> 01:08:45,000
我們自己知道我們沒什么不就行了
We know it's not true, so why worry?

754
01:08:49,220 --> 01:08:50,260
原來我也這樣想
I used to think that too,

755
01:08:52,090 --> 01:08:53,280
所以不怕別人說閑話
and it didn't worry me.

756
01:08:57,270 --> 01:08:58,540
我相信我自己不會像他們那樣
I thought we wouldn't be like them.

757
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:04,370
原來會的
But I was wrong.

758
01:09:07,770 --> 01:09:09,230
我知道你不會離開你丈夫
You won't leave your husband.

759
01:09:12,590 --> 01:09:13,700
我想離開一下
So I'd rather go away.

760
01:09:21,350 --> 01:09:22,990
我沒有想過你真的會喜歡我
I didn't think you'd fall in love with me.

761
01:09:24,900 --> 01:09:25,890
我也沒有想過
I didn't either.

762
01:09:31,790 --> 01:09:33,760
我一直在想  他們是怎樣開始的
I was only curious to know how it started.

763
01:09:35,460 --> 01:09:36,500
現在我明白了
Now I know.

764
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:40,500
原來很多事情都這樣
Feelings can creep up just like that.

765
01:09:45,310 --> 01:09:46,320
我還以為自己沒有什么
I thought I was in control.

766
01:09:47,980 --> 01:09:49,900
但是開始擔心你丈夫幾時會回來
But I hate to think of our husband coming home.

767
01:09:51,450 --> 01:09:52,480
最好不要回來
I wish he'd stay away.

768
01:09:54,750 --> 01:09:55,860
我知道這樣想不對
I'm so bad.

769
01:10:00,010 --> 01:10:01,160
你能不能幫我一個忙
Will you do me one favour?

770
01:10:03,180 --> 01:10:04,030
做什么  
What?

771
01:10:05,980 --> 01:10:07,090
我想有點心理準備
I want to be prepared.

772
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:05,710
以后不要再找我了
You'd better not see me again.

773
01:11:11,310 --> 01:11:12,620
你老公他回來了  
Is your husband back?

774
01:11:13,940 --> 01:11:14,850
是啊
Yes.

775
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:18,470
我真沒用
Am I hopeless?

776
01:11:21,370 --> 01:11:22,320
不是啊
Not really.

777
01:11:33,220 --> 01:11:34,700
我不會再找你了
I won't see you again.

778
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:38,760
好好地守著你的丈夫
Keep a closer eye on your husband.

779
01:12:20,060 --> 01:12:20,890
別這樣
Please.

780
01:12:22,940 --> 01:12:24,530
說了試著的嘛
Don't be serious it's only a rehearsal.

781
01:12:26,570 --> 01:12:27,530
別哭
Don't cry.

782
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:33,620
這又不是真的
This isn't real.

783
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:26,030
我今天晚上不想回家
I don't want to go home tonight.

784
01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:55,810
陳美儀點給好朋友權仔和文文

785
01:13:56,210 --> 01:13:57,520
祝他們成功

786
01:13:57,860 --> 01:13:59,860
又點給同屋的張太太收聽
And Mrs. Cheung wishes the best to

787
01:14:00,420 --> 01:14:01,920
祝家庭幸福
her neighbors.

有一位在日本公干的陳先生

798
01:18:38,650 --> 01:18:39,920
你會不會帶我一起走  
Would you go with me?

799
01:18:54,950 --> 01:18:59,120
哈羅  周先生不在  他上班去了

01:19:02,990 --> 01:19:05,040
不用謝  拜拜
You're welcome.

802
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:36,150
是不是有人進過我房間  
Has anyone been in my room?

803
01:19:36,430 --> 01:19:37,340
沒有呀
No.

804

沒有  我丟了東西
Something's missing.

丟了什么呀
What?

806
01:20:11,150 --> 01:20:14,720
你知不知道  從前的人
In the old days.

807
01:20:15,490 --> 01:20:18,830
要是心里有了秘密  不想別人知道
If someone had a secret they didn't want to share.

808
01:20:19,540 --> 01:20:20,790
你知不知道他們會怎樣做  
You know what they did?

809
01:20:22,130 --> 01:20:23,280
我怎么知道  
Have no idea.

810
01:20:27,470 --> 01:20:29,220
他們會跑到山上找一棵樹
They went up to a mountain, found a tree.

811
01:20:31,390 --> 01:20:32,890
在樹上挖個洞
Carved a hole in it.

812
01:20:34,020 --> 01:20:35,600
然后把秘密全說進去
And whispered the secret into the hole.

813
01:20:37,160 --> 01:20:38,830
再用泥巴封起來
Then they covered it with mud.

814
01:20:40,950 --> 01:20:44,990
那秘密就永遠留在那棵樹里  沒人知道
And leave the secret there forever.

815
01:20:47,590 --> 01:20:51,430
這樣辛苦  找個女人發泄一下不更好
What a pain, I'd just go to get laid.

816
01:20:54,900 --> 01:20:55,890
誰都像你呀
Not everyone's like you.

817
01:20:58,030 --> 01:20:59,800
說得是呀  像我這樣的人
I'm just an average guy.

818
01:21:00,120 --> 01:21:01,900
是個直腸子  哪來的心事呀  
I don't have secrets like you?

819
01:21:02,330 --> 01:21:04,990
你可不同  什么都往心里擱
You bottle things up.

820
01:21:05,380 --> 01:21:06,510
說來聽聽嘛
Tell me something.

我哪有心事
I don't have secrets.

是啊  很久沒來這里看你
It's been a while.

835
01:25:05,390 --> 01:25:06,820
今天剛好經過這里
I was nearby

836

特意把船票帶給你

請你吃的
And a small gift.

838
01:25:10,630 --> 01:25:13,740
哎呀  上來坐坐就好了  還這樣客氣  又破費
You shouldn't have, it's nice just to see you.

839
01:25:13,820 --> 01:25:16,010
你看這屋里亂七八糟的
The place is in such a mess.

840
01:25:16,250 --> 01:25:17,120
你還在收拾啊  
Already started packing?

841
01:25:17,540 --> 01:25:19,500
已經收拾好幾天了
It's hopeless,

842
01:25:20,040 --> 01:25:23,650
東西太多  有些又舍不得扔
I can't bear to throw things away.

Eat with us, Mrs. Chan, I'm going to the market.

846
01:25:40,390 --> 01:25:42,870
不行呢  我還得回公司辦點事
I can't, I have work waiting.

847
01:25:44,570 --> 01:25:45,600
你干嘛急著走
Don't rush off,

848
01:25:46,540 --> 01:25:47,760
你不留在這兒吃飯
if you don't eat here.

849
01:25:48,210 --> 01:25:51,420
太太要不高興的  太太  
Mrs. Suen will be upset.

850
01:25:51,420 --> 01:25:52,920
噯  你替我倒杯茶來
Amah, pour me some tea too.

851
01:25:55,100 --> 01:25:56,300
陳先生好嗎  
How's your husband?

852
01:25:56,660 --> 01:25:58,000
挺好的  有心了
He's fine, thank you.

853
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:00,000
你打算走多久  
How long will you be away?

854
01:26:01,190 --> 01:26:02,240
我也不曉得
I don't know.

855
01:26:02,430 --> 01:26:04,690
要是住的慣呢我就不回來了
If I like it, I might stay.

856
01:26:05,860 --> 01:26:06,730
為什么  
Why?

857
01:26:06,980 --> 01:26:09,830
我女兒說現在香港這么亂
My daughter worries about the situation in Hong Kong.

858
01:26:09,880 --> 01:26:12,490
我自己一個人在這邊她不放心
She worry about I stay alone in Hong Kong.

859
01:26:12,590 --> 01:26:15,750
我倒是舍不得離開香港的
I don't want to leave.

860
01:26:15,780 --> 01:26:18,740
不過自從顧先生他們搬走了以后
Since the Koos left.

861
01:26:18,990 --> 01:26:22,110
搓麻將也沒搭伴
I don't have my mahjong partners anymore.

862
01:26:22,640 --> 01:26:28,220
想想呢  還是到美國去給女兒帶孩子算了
And my daughter needs help with her kids in the US.

863
01:26:31,620 --> 01:26:33,040
這房子怎么辦  
What about this place?

864
01:26:33,660 --> 01:26:36,110
正為了這個傷腦筋嘛
I'm not sure.

865
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:39,770
賣出去呢真不舍得
I don't want to sell it.

866
01:26:41,870 --> 01:26:43,400
想想還是租給人家吧
So I might rent it out.

867
01:26:44,250 --> 01:26:45,990
你打算租多少錢  
How much would you want?

868
01:26:46,790 --> 01:26:49,310
噯  你有意思租嗎  
You're interested?

869
01:26:49,470 --> 01:26:54,250
租給你我可就放心了  我便宜點租給你啦
You could have it at a discount.

870
01:26:54,860 --> 01:26:55,680
我想想看
I'll think about it.

871
01:26:56,030 --> 01:26:57,310
太太  吃茶
Mrs. Suen, your tea.

872
01:26:59,250 --> 01:27:01,700
對了  現在是什么人住在隔壁  
Who lives next door now?

873
01:27:02,100 --> 01:27:06,590
我也不大曉得  不像以前  都沒往來
I don't really know them.

874
01:27:06,720 --> 01:27:12,850
以前跟顧先生顧太太不知多熱鬧
The Koos were almost like family.

875
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:18,020
像一家人一樣  想起來也開心
It was so nice then.

876
01:27:18,200 --> 01:27:19,530
你說是嗎  
wasn't it?

877
01:27:20,040 --> 01:27:21,170
是啊
Yes.

878
01:27:22,930 --> 01:27:24,080
過來這邊坐
Let's sit over here.

879
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:51,590
你找哪位  
Yes?

880
01:27:52,370 --> 01:27:53,280
請問顧先生在不在  
Is Mr.Koo in?

881
01:27:53,880 --> 01:27:55,950
顧先生  搬了好久了
He moved long ago.

882
01:27:57,180 --> 01:27:58,160
知不知道搬到哪兒去了  
Do you know where he is?

883
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:00,590
你跟他很熟嗎  
You know him well?

884
01:28:02,100 --> 01:28:03,010
我從前住在這里
I used to live here.

885
01:28:04,860 --> 01:28:05,990
孫太太還住在隔壁嗎  
Is Mrs. Suen still next door?

886
01:28:07,030 --> 01:28:09,640
也搬了  現在亂成這樣
She's gone, it's too chaotic.

887
01:28:10,390 --> 01:28:11,890
能走的還不走嗎  
Everyone's running away.

888
01:28:12,950 --> 01:28:14,150
現在隔壁住著什么人  
So who lives there now?

889
01:28:15,210 --> 01:28:16,280
我也不太清楚
I am not sure.

890
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:18,580
好像就是一個女人帶著她兒子
A woman and her son.

891
01:28:19,880 --> 01:28:21,310
那小孩子蠻可愛的
The kid is cute.

892
01:28:24,730 --> 01:28:26,600
他菲律賓的地址我沒找著
No address in the Philippines.

893
01:28:27,730 --> 01:28:28,870
只有他兒子的電話
Just his son's phone number.

894
01:28:30,320 --> 01:28:32,310
-你拿回去  -這怎行

895
01:28:32,950 --> 01:28:33,980

-那么謝謝了  -慢走

-好了  -快點
- Okay. - Let's go.

899
01:29:15,200 --> 01:29:19,620
柬埔寨首都機場上
The presidential corps waits at Pochentong Airport.

900
01:29:20,210 --> 01:29:24,540
皇室人員上前
