they instigated the rebellion.

670
01:00:23,417 --> 01:00:25,292
I am also educated, Sir.

671
01:00:26,708 --> 01:00:28,388
But you seem rational.

672
01:00:29,542 --> 01:00:32,618
You are here, in the
heart of the British Empire

673
01:00:32,708 --> 01:00:36,292
making a good, honest,
lawful living like us.

674
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,867
You'll make a good salesman.

675
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:42,958
Thank you, Sir.

676
01:01:03,542 --> 01:01:05,167
H.S.R.A.

677
01:01:05,458 --> 01:01:08,577
Hindustan Socialist
Republican Association.

678
01:01:08,667 --> 01:01:11,083
Is this organization still active?

679
01:01:12,792 --> 01:01:15,250
HSRA... you used to be a member!

680
01:01:18,375 --> 01:01:19,735
Is Koppikar or...

681
01:01:19,875 --> 01:01:22,917
S.S. Johal a member? Hmm?

682
01:01:23,493 --> 01:01:26,193
You were associated with
Bhagat Singh too, didn't you?

683
01:01:26,283 --> 01:01:27,893
Don't talk about Bhagat Singh!

684
01:01:27,983 --> 01:01:30,183
He says let's not talk about him.

685
01:01:31,167 --> 01:01:33,625
I have your whole history here

686
01:01:34,750 --> 01:01:36,483
you might as well tell me.

687
01:01:37,792 --> 01:01:38,785
Now wake up man!

688
01:01:38,875 --> 01:01:42,243
They are not going to let you
walk away from this, this time!

689
01:01:42,333 --> 01:01:45,789
They are going to hang you
like they did Bhagat Singh!

690
01:01:49,583 --> 01:01:51,292
They call us 'Rebels'...

691
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:55,008
If asking for your rights,
is being rebellious…

692
01:01:55,333 --> 01:01:57,750
Then, yes, we are rebels!

693
01:01:58,458 --> 01:02:00,208
That was earlier,

694
01:02:00,708 --> 01:02:02,833
now they label us 'Terrorists!'

695
01:02:03,260 --> 01:02:06,460
There is a difference between
a terrorist and a revolutionary...

696
01:02:06,550 --> 01:02:08,230
A significant difference!

697
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:12,292
A revolutionary's action is symbolic

698
01:02:12,958 --> 01:02:15,042
meant to register a protest.

699
01:02:15,625 --> 01:02:18,625
Their motive is not to create fear.

700
01:02:19,708 --> 01:02:23,000
On the contrary, they inspire

701
01:02:23,417 --> 01:02:25,017
to fight for rights!

702
01:02:25,125 --> 01:02:26,725
People's own rights!

703
01:02:27,125 --> 01:02:30,167
Purpose of a revolutionary

704
01:02:30,333 --> 01:02:32,375
is to fight for freedom.

705
01:02:32,583 --> 01:02:34,183
And freedom for all!

706
01:02:34,625 --> 01:02:39,042
A true revolutionary has
to follow certain tenets.

707
01:02:40,083 --> 01:02:41,702
You cannot be prejudiced,

708
01:02:41,792 --> 01:02:43,000
nor communal,

709
01:02:43,625 --> 01:02:45,000
nor casteist.

710
01:02:46,135 --> 01:02:48,535
There is no economic
or social class difference.

711
01:02:48,625 --> 01:02:50,125
The only truth

712
01:02:51,333 --> 01:02:53,583
is equality.

713
01:02:54,375 --> 01:02:55,375
Equality!

714
01:02:56,250 --> 01:02:58,160
To treat all humans as equals,

715
01:02:58,250 --> 01:03:00,450
with a strong belief in humanity!

716
01:03:01,167 --> 01:03:04,292
There is a significant
difference, brother!

717
01:03:04,708 --> 01:03:06,750
-Yes, understood.
-Okay, Bhagat

718
01:03:07,458 --> 01:03:09,875
after freedom; What first?

719
01:03:10,125 --> 01:03:11,565
Oh! After freedom.

720
01:03:12,833 --> 01:03:15,625
I will watch a Chaplin film,

721
01:03:16,083 --> 01:03:18,042
buy an expensive British wine

722
01:03:18,167 --> 01:03:19,167
and…

723
01:03:20,333 --> 01:03:21,333
Ma'am -Me?

724
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,702
With a English lady by my side

725
01:03:23,792 --> 01:03:26,458
I will do the ball dance. [LAUGHTER]

726
01:03:28,375 --> 01:03:30,833
…then just eat and sleep.

727

[LAUGHTER]

728
01:03:33,125 --> 01:03:34,858
Then get up in the morning

729
01:03:35,583 --> 01:03:36,583
have a bath,

730
01:03:36,917 --> 01:03:39,500
and repeat the routine...[LAUGHTER]

731
01:03:42,167 --> 01:03:43,167
Ask him

732
01:03:44,417 --> 01:03:46,750
what was he doing when he was 23?

733
01:03:48,917 --> 01:03:52,708
He is asking what you were
doing when you were 23?

734
01:03:55,375 --> 01:03:57,575
What was I doing when I was 23...

735
01:03:59,333 --> 01:04:00,333
Tell me.

736
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,875
I was just married.

737
01:04:08,250 --> 01:04:10,450
We were expecting our first born.

738
01:04:12,292 --> 01:04:13,792
I was the

739
01:04:15,458 --> 01:04:18,333
youngest detective constable on the force.

740
01:04:19,875 --> 01:04:21,125
Happy days!

741
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,000
Hmm...

742
01:04:26,375 --> 01:04:28,833
So don't talk about Bhagat Singh!

743
01:04:30,583 --> 01:04:32,383
You know nothing about him.

"The two men responsible

both belonging to the Hindustan

'Down with imperialism' and
'Workers of the world unite, '

01:04:50,833 --> 01:04:54,535
Both men did not flee after the
act but willingly courted arrest.

With the Labour party watching closely

the ruling Conservatives
have decided to order strict

prosecution of the members

in Lahore and Saharanpur,

killing several members

including Sukhdev and Rajguru,

But cannot kill my ideas.

is unstoppable.

You will never earn your rights, unless

you rise up in protest

772

or fight the oppressors.

can be worse than slavery.

Freedom is our birth right,

777
01:06:00,792 --> 01:06:03,167
and therefore

778
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:07,167
we reject this oppressive regime.

779

And for the criticism
of resorting to violence.

We are not blood thirsty,

we do not harbour hate
toward any individual or country.

782

We are simply against the
exploitation of one by the other.

Most importantly

784
01:06:37,750 --> 01:06:40,833
we do not want our rights in piecemeal.

01:06:41,917 --> 01:06:45,493
Neither the illusion of semi-independence.

farmers, workers and students…

788

Depends, Sir.

No.

another river in the Punjab.

take people to the hospital…

1046
01:26:31,042 --> 01:26:34,114
that was a sign that it
was good for them to go.

1047
01:26:40,750 --> 01:26:44,500
So, you don't think it was brutal, Sir?

1048
01:26:46,208 --> 01:26:47,648
It was sufficient.

1049
01:26:49,917 --> 01:26:53,000
He was faced with a seditious mob.

1050
01:26:54,500 --> 01:26:55,958
He created fear,

1051
01:26:57,292 --> 01:26:58,972

1052

How can someone be so demonic?

1054
01:27:20,542 --> 01:27:23,583
He had absolutely no
remorse for what he did!

1055
01:27:25,083 --> 01:27:26,683
So you left the job?

1056

Otherwise I would have killed him.

1057
01:27:31,458 --> 01:27:34,410
But that would not have
registered as a protest.

1058
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:38,292
It would be construed as a
crime against an employer

1059
01:27:39,458 --> 01:27:44,375
and that would have tainted
the credibility of all workers.

1060
