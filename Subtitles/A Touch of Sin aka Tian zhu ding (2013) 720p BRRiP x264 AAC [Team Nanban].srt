00:00:04,594 --> 00:00:10,594
A Team Nanban (594mgnav) Release

1
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,527
Stop!

2
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:14,201
Mister, you got some money for us?

3
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,085
Come on.

4
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,051
Quick.

5
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,130
Quick!

6
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:32,322
WUJINSHAN (Black Gold Mountain)

7
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,202
Which way to Wujinshan?

8
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,361
You're here.

9
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,683
- Highway 307?
- This is it.

10
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,161
Dahai.

11
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,169
Whose trike is that outside?

12
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,969
I don't know.

13
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,445
No?

14
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,489
Sit down, Dahai.

15
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,281
It's been there two days.
No idea whose it is.

16
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,250
If no one wants it, I'll sell it.

17
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,687
So if the village chief's Audi A6
sat outside his house,

18
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,888
you'd sell that too?

19
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,041
What do you think?

20
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,408
His A6 belongs to everyone in the village.

21
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,241
He sold the state-owned coal mine
so he could afford it.

22
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,840
No wonder the car looks so familiar.

23
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,764
Those shiny wheels are actually mine.

24
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,081
You're smart.

25
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,645
Dahai.

26
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,848
A pity you weren't born earlier.

27
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,968
In the war years,

28
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,209
you'd surely have made general.

29
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,725
Just see what happens.

30
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,167
When I report to Beijing,

31
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,245
the chief and the new boss Jiao
will be hauling sand in prison.

32
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,609
Before you even get to Taiyuan,
the chief's men will catch you.

33
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,724
Why do you think I studied law?

34
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:03,088
The chief sold off
collectively owned property.

35
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,208
He accepted a bribe.

36
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,248
That'll get him 20 years.

37
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:11,041
As for your boss Jiao Shengli,
he's rolling in it, right?

38
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,681
<i>I'll</i> accuse him of polluting
and covering up accidents in the mine.

39
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,364
They'll close him down.

40
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,841
Believe it.

41
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:25,688
If the coal mine had gone to you,
you'd have been no different.

42
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,649
I would have.

43
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:32,328
Jiao's Maserati is parked in the yard.
Nobody uses it.

44
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,768
Drive it off and sell it.
Then you can buy us all a drink.

45
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,161
I don't want his fucking car.

46
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,761
- Sanming. Got the train ticket?
- Yes.

47
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:48,003
- Where are you going?
- To see my wife for New Year's.

48
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,162
That's romantic.

49
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,242
The police are here.

50
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,169
Stop eating.

51
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,603
Investigation.

52
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,286
Are all the migrant workers here?

53
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,691
Yes. What's wrong?

54
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,128
A murder in Shibawan.
The migrants have to be checked.

55
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,283
Get them all outside.

56
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,089
Hurry!

57
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,406
Chief.

58
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,641
Village Chief.

59
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:25,770
When you sold off the coal mine
you promised yearly dividends.

60
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,808
I said that in private.

61
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,723
I don't have time now.

62
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:33,168
Okay, explain it
to the Discipline Commission.

63
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,725
You've picked
the wrong time for a fight.

64
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,450
You'll be a loser your whole life.

65
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,607
- You won't discuss it?
- You talk too much.

66
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:14,127
Okay. People from Chongqing.

67
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,766
Over there.

68
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,126
Next.

69
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,369
He's making a run for it!

70
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,885
Damn animal!

71
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,167
What's up, Dahai?

72
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,084
I'm writing to the Discipline Commission

73
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,289
to complain about the chief
and Jiao Shengli.

74
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,726
Miss, a registered letter.

75
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,691
- To whom?
- Beijing. Zhongnanhai. The Commission.

76
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,491
I need the full address.

77
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,403
Zhongnanhai, Beijing.

78
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,689
That's not enough. I need the full address.

79
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:34,082
What? Everyone knows Zhongnanhai.

80
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,162
That's not enough.

81
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,130
Miss, are you siding
with the village chief?

82
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,521
Does he give you kickbacks?

83
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,605
Or are you Jiao's mistress?
Has he bought you a car?

84
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,762
You're crazy! Go away!

85
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,000
You two must be in league.

86
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,969
There's no justice!

87
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,280
No justice!

88
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,689
No justice.

89
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:11,205
All aboard! We're leaving, hurry!

90
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:14,124
Dahai, come on!

91
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,641
What's this for?

92
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,805
Greeting Boss Jiao.
One bag of flour per person.

93
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,485
Boss Jiao has a new private plane.
He's flying back from Hong Kong.

94
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,928
We're a welcoming group.
Everyone gets a bag of flour.

95
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,368
A plane?
Living on this earth isn't enough?

96
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,725
Were you at the coal mine
when the gun was fired?

97
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,370
Yes.

98
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,322
Who was the guy who ran away?

99
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,927
A loader in the coal yard. From Sichuan.

100
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,686
Why did he run? The killings in Shibawan?

101
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,922
He's an escaped prisoner.

102
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,169
Killed someone in his hometown.
He's been hiding here.

103
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,083
He thought they'd come for him.

104
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,561
He panicked and ran.

105
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:10,122
- Did they catch him?
- Of course.

106
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,210
- What happened in Shibawan?
- Don't you know?

107
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:20,968
Someone shot three guys yesterday.
Three dead in Shibawan.

108
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,611
- Who did it?
- I don't know.

109
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:28,527
Early this morning,
a bunch of armed police were in Shibawan.

110
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,522
I see.

111
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:38,367
Accountant Liu,
are your accounts up to date?

112
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:44,170
When Boss Jiao got hold of the coal mine

113
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,722
he said 40% of the profits
would go to the village.

114
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:52,402
How much do the last
14 years' dividends come to?

115
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,529
Listen, back in 2001,

116
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:59,167
the village committee
signed to sell the coal mine.

117
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,242
Who asked you to sell it?

118
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,607
Was the contract discussed?

119
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,921
We must keep our word.

120
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,961
But Jiao got so rich
he even bought a plane.

121
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,088
He's a hard worker.

122
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:19,321
Then tell me how much you
and the chief took in bribes.

123
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,562
Stop, please.

124
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:26,164
Tell me how much you took in bribes.

125
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,765
Open the door.

126
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:32,522
Devils like you are more evil
than the village chief and Jiao.

127
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:42,606
- Listen to me -
- Don't talk to me.

128
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:54,170
Everyone, repeat after me.

129
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,681
Welcome! Welcome!

130
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,330
A warm welcome!

131
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,085
Good.

132
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,208
Here's the plane!

133
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,763
Mr. Jiao, you've reached a new level.

134
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,525
Let's progress together.

135
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,841
Congratulations, ma'am.

136
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,684
Kids, the flowers.

137
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,087
Mr. Jiao, look this way.

138
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,126
A bit closer, please.

139
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:33,362
- Please say something, sir.
- Later.

140
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,042
How are you, Auntie?

141
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,809
Thanks for coming.

142
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,803
Long time no see.

143
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,486
- Shengli!
- Dahai.

144
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,642
Congratulations.

145
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,643
Thank you, Dahai.

146
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,848
You're a hard man to reach.

147
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,968
There's something I want to discuss.

148
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,048
Can you do me a favor?

149
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,043
Whatever you need, just ask.

150
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,963
Sponsor my journey to Beijing

151
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:15,442
to file accusations
against you and the village chief.

152
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,770
Sure, come and pick it up later.

153
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,207
Here, in front of all these villagers,

154
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,443
can't you discuss the village economy?

155
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,407
What are you staring at?

156
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,683
Xiao Bai, are you playing golf?

157
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:48,480
I'm here to compensate you
on behalf of the Shengli Group.

158
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,523
Case closed.

159
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,209
Where's your mother?

160
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,887
- Who are you?
- Don't you remember me?

161
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,726
I'm your uncle from Wujinshan.

162
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:04,202
Mom went out for food.
She'll be back soon.

163
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,325
Animal.

164
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,368
Where's your dad?

165
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,683
Out hunting “animals.”

166
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,842
On which mountain?

167
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,644
Jiaokou.

168
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,609
Dahai.

169
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,651
You've -

170
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,322
When did you get here?

171
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,085
I've been in town a couple of days.

172
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,688
Let's go inside.

173
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,885
Ganggang. Eat first, then homework.

174
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,962
Of course, Mom.

175
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,809
You're -

176
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,370
Tell me.

177
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,161
A while back,
I introduced you to a woman from Wangcun.

178
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,288
You were well matched.

179
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,566
But you -

180
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,723
Why didn't you date her, as arranged?

181
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:09,930
You never think about your life.

182
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,087
All you do is make accusations.

183
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:18,846
Even if your charges stick, you'll grow old.

184
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:22,766
I'm already old. But I don't care.

185
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,649
Don't be silly.

186
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,405
You're only middle-aged.

187
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,927
The kid's here.

188
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,287
I'm at fault here.

189
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,488
You really are hopeless.

190
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,530
I told you when we were still at school.

191
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:47,331
There's more to life than getting rich.

192
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:51,007
You want to be more evil
than Jiao Shengli?

193
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,321
How can you compare me with him?

194
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,562
If not him, then who?

195
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,842
You and he were classmates.

196
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:02,403
Look what he's made of himself
compared to us here.

197
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:07,722
You have your own place in Wujinshan.

198
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:13,682
But my husband and I
don't even have a home of our own.

199
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,005
Enough of this.

200
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:20,448
If you have time on your hands,
why not open a restaurant?

201
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,729
Or a shop?
To earn money and get married.

202
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:28,124
Your life belongs to you.
Stop caring what others do.

203
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:34,850
My dear, wait and see.

204
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:39,482
I can be more evil
than the village chief or Jiao.

205
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,003
Isn't that Mr. Golf?

206
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,721
- What did you call me?
- Mr. Golf.

207
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:20,247
Everyone calls you Mr. Golf now.
Didn't you know?

208
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,364
Mr. Golf!

209
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,645
I...

210
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,451
Lin Chong...

211
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,527
unsheathed my sword and, in anger,

212
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,444
slew two of Gao Qiu's henchmen.

213
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,000
Fortunately for me,

214
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,651
<i>Officer Chen gave me a document</i>

215
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,805
which enabled me to come to Mount Liang.

216
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,764
Good morning.

217
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,686
Dahai, good morning.

218
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,808
I want a word with your husband.

219
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,723
Go ahead.

220
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,010
Write.

221
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,369
Write what?

222
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:01,249
You know how much
the village chief embezzled.

223
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:04,728
- Write a confession.
- You're being ridiculous.

224
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,926
What are you doing? That's dangerous.

225
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,809
Write it down.

226
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,404
Write!

227
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,405
Write.

228
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,805
Shoot.

229
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,690
Shoot me here.

230
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:22,244
You're too much of a coward to kill me.

231
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:56,209
Village Chief. it's Liuliu.

232
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,248
I just started work.

233
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,882
What do you want done?

234
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:07,368
Okay, don't worry.
I'll do it this afternoon.

235
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,244
Mr. Golf.

236
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,482
- Where's the chief?
- At the temple.

237
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:18,569
What did you just call me?

238
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,326
Mr. Golf.

239
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:23,085
Isn't that your foreign name?

240
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,844
Little bastard.

241
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,604
What did you say?

242
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,329
- Dahai.
- Where are you off to?

243
00:33:56,400 --> 00:34:00,086
Fengjie. Going hunting?

244
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,924
Hunting animals.

245
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,962
Stop fooling around.

246
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,323
Calm down.

247
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:40,689
Let's sit down and talk.

248
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,969
We can sort it out.

249
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:04,762
Listen, don't be impulsive.

250
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,530
Let's sit down.

251
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,050
Bastard!

252
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,284
Dahai?

253
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,962
How can we fix this?

254
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,246
Just tell me.

255
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,805
Hey.

256
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,767
You got a light?

257
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,330
No.

258
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,162
Motorcycle taxi.

259
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,446
- Where to, buddy?
- The expressway.

260
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,443
Let's go.

261
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:02,402
<i>Our Mrs. Zhou here
worked hard to raise her children.</i>

262
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,727
<i>Now it's her 70th birthday,</i>

263
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:08,930
<i>so let's wish her happiness,
good health and a long life.</i>

264
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:15,091
<i>And now, let's welcome
her second son and his family,</i>

265
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,248
<i>with their birthday greetings.</i>

266
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:19,322
San'er is here!

267
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:23,361
The youngest son is back.

268
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:33,841
You're back.

269
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,922
Brother.

270
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,526
Why are you running off?

271
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,170
Come here.

272
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,400
Mother.

273
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,490
Don't cry.

274
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:11,048
Where did you come from?

275
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:17,367
I came by boat.

276
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:20,489
And before that?

277
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:27,449
I got your money transfers.

278
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:29,568
130,000 yuan in all.

279
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:34,009
That's right.

280
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:41,251
The most recent one came from Shanxi.

281
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:06,520
I earned it in Wuhan
and sent it from Shanxi.

282
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:13,849
I don't want your money.

283
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,888
Your brothers are coming.

284
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:16,245
Mother's birthday was on the 7th day
of the 11th lunar month.

285
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:20,450
But we two had to work that day.
We couldn't get home.

286
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:23,729
Our relatives couldn't get here either.

287
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,926
Since New Year is now
and many people come home,

288
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,571
we decided to celebrate today.

289
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:37,162
I'll go through it for you both.

290
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:40,365
For Mother's 70th birthday celebrations

291
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:46,322
we received gifts of money
totaling 10,270 yuan.

292
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:49,968
12 tables of guests.

293
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:54,090
To buy meat, vegetables,
wine and cigarettes,

294
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:59,007
the total cost
was 6,477 yuan and 33 cents.

295
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,083
I hired a host for 800 yuan.

296
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:05,891
Taking all expenses into account,

297
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:11,285
I had to spend 7,485 yuan and 42 cents.

298
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:13,567
That was the total cost.

299
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:20,003
What's left is 2,784 yuan and 58 cents.

300
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:24,090
This money, the way I see it,

301
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:27,289
should be shared
between us three and Mother.

302
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:28,885
A quarter each.

303
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:32,965
I've already divided it
into four equal shares.

304
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:36,371
- Right, Second Brother?
- Yes.

305
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:40,963
I don't need a share.
Give mine to Mother.

306
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:51,882
I bought ten packs of cigarettes.
A good brand.

307
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:55,768
There are nine left.

308
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:59,242
So, that makes three each.

309
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:06,841
As the oldest brother
I have to be impartial.

310
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:11,963
If you want your share to go to Mother,

311
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:14,687
give it to her yourself.

312
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:52,249
People usually worship the gods tomorrow.

313
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:56,127
I'm worshiping ghosts.

314
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:31,643
The gods were to blame.

315
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:35,802
If you have any grievances,
tell heaven about them.

316
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:40,888
Is Qinqin in Dongguan?
Didn't she come back with you?

317
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:43,440
She's gone to Zhongshan.

318
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:44,961
She won't be back.

319
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:49,121
She tested HIV positive.

320
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:51,609
AIDS?

321
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:54,646
Didn't she work in a factory?

322
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:59,006
Impossible to make a decent living.

323
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:03,644
Lili has a hair salon in Zhongshan,
so Qinqin went to work there.

324
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:09,083
She provided “special services.”
That's how she got AIDS.

325
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:10,726
Bloody...

326
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:13,324
you slept with her once.

327
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:15,926
You'd better have a check-up.

328
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,448
Don't talk crap.

329
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:21,842
Get a check-up, quick. Good luck with it.

330
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:26,847
What's your wife up to in Tianjin
while you're stuck here?

331
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:29,566
You should get her checked up.

332
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:31,881
- Maybe you have HIV.
- What?

333
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:34,088
You should keep your mouth shut.

334
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:36,208
You want to die?

335
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:39,171
Scumbag! Let's settle this right now!

336
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:42,331
Action? Let's see it, then.

337
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:46,007
Only 78 minutes to go
till the New Year bell.

338
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:49,490
Think you can take me?

339
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:27,124
- Shall we set off a firework?
- Great!

340
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:34,610
Watch.

341
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:08,845
Tickets to Guangzhou, 240 yuan.

342
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:12,003
Wuhan. Anybody for Wuhan?

343
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:18,364
Want a ticket?

344
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:21,444
- To Nanning?
- Yes, how many?

345
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:23,761
Where else?

346
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:25,444
Yichang.

347
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:31,362
One each for Guangzhou,
Yichang and Nanning.

348
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:34,250
Wait for me on the bridge.
<i>I'll</i> bring them.

349
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:37,130
- Be quick.
- Okay, wait for me.

350
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:42,930
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

351
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:47,244
<i>Chongqing Railway Station reminds you</i>

352
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:50,164
<i>that during this holiday congestion</i>

353
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:52,607
<i>it is strictly prohibited
to carry combustible materials</i>

354
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:56,526
<i>as well as firearms and knives.</i>

355
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:04,407
Will you go to Guangzhou,

356
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:06,482
Yichang.

357
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,764
Or Nanning?

358
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:32,207
You've looked in my bag?

359
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:42,208
Not sure yet. I'd like to go to Burma.

360
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:51,211
You can't stay here in the village?

361
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:04,401
It's boring.

362
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:08,566
What isn't boring?

363
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:16,043
Shooting guns isn't boring.

364
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,482
What would you do in Burma?

365
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:38,003
I'd buy a new fast-loading pistol.

366
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:46,045
You should buy a cell phone.
Then I could call you.

367
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:52,404
No way.

368
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:54,482
Too dangerous.

369
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:05,121
Can I help you?

370
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:08,688
Just looking.

371
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:20,283
Feel free.

372
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:24,289
- Where's the bathroom?
- Over there.

373
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:27,204
Can you watch my bag? I'll be right back.

374
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:29,408
All right.

375
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:22,410
- Go ahead and start the car.
- Be careful.

376
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:39,249
Xiaoyan.

377
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:42,483
- Where are you going?
- To get her immunized.

378
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:45,040
Time for her shot?

379
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:46,451
Afraid?

380
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:47,891
Say no.

381
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:50,361
- How are things?
- As usual.

382
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:51,720
Let's have tea sometime.

383
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:53,564
I'll call you.

384
01:01:58,120 --> 01:02:00,805
Driver, stop here.

385
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:05,885
Stop.

386
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:08,008
I can't, till the next rest area.

387
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:09,923
Stop here.

388
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:43,848
Traffic jam?

389
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:46,400
Small delay in Tianmen.

390
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:50,926
When did you get here?

391
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:53,124
Just now.

392
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:03,202
You're frowning.

393
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:10,125
To get to the station?

394
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:13,801
I booked a black car.
The driver's waiting.

395
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:22,647
Driver Wang? it's me.

396
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:24,449
Car booked for Xiaoyu.

397
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:26,648
You can come now.

398
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:28,290
Okay.

399
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:37,008
Did you tell her?

400
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:45,089
I started to.

401
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:48,449
What did you say?

402
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:52,050
I hinted.

403
01:04:55,720 --> 01:04:58,007
You're delaying again.

404
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:05,647
She must have understood.

405
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:16,521
Come to Guangzhou with me.

406
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:25,600
I've been with you so many years.

407
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:27,808
Why do I wait?

408
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:31,081
I accept things the way they are.

409
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:33,367
But I owe my parents an explanation.

410
01:05:56,600 --> 01:05:58,648
I want a baby.

411
01:06:06,680 --> 01:06:08,728
Let's go to Guangzhou together.

412
01:06:20,320 --> 01:06:24,803
Either you stay with your wife
and we separate,

413
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:29,090
or you divorce her and we live together.

414
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:32,809
You have to choose.

415
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:38,402
Let's go together.

416
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:49,130
Once you get back to Guangzhou,
<i>I'll</i> give you six months.

417
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:55,370
We can both think it over,
then make the decision.

418
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:42,410
Sir, there's a problem with your bag.

419
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:44,482
Please come to have it checked.

420
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:58,528
Open the bag.

421
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:09,409
You can't take this on the train.

422
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:12,888
- It's a fruit knife.
- It's not permitted.

423
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:16,442
- Why not?
- Regulations.

424
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:18,922
What if I eat an apple?

425
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,082
Eat it with the peel.

426
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:26,850
Give it to me, I'll take it.

427
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:29,443
Then you can't go.

428
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:31,446
I'm not going.

429
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:33,648
Or enter the station.

430
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:38,369
Forget the knife.

431
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:46,167
Your ID card?

432
01:08:57,400 --> 01:08:59,164
<i>I'll</i> leave first.

433
01:09:00,320 --> 01:09:03,130
Call me when you get there.

434
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:33,601
<i>This is your final call for train 934</i>

435
01:10:33,680 --> 01:10:39,050
<i>from Yichang East to Guangzhou East.</i>

436
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:53,729
<i>Fellow countrymen in Yuanshan village,</i>

437
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:56,963
<i>come and have a look!</i>

438
01:12:57,040 --> 01:12:59,691
<i>Roll up, roll up!</i>

439
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:03,606
<i>See the holy snakes. See the beauty.</i>

440
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:06,729
<i>A marriage is to be.</i>

441
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:09,963
<i>The holy snakes foretell weal and woe.</i>

442
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:12,771
<i>Roll up, roll up!</i>

443
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:16,731
<i>See the holy snakes. See the beauty.</i>

444
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:41,321
NIGHT-COMER SAUNA

445
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:16,043
Good evening, sir. Overnight or sauna?

446
01:14:21,200 --> 01:14:23,806
- Are you Xiaoyu?
- Yes.

447
01:14:23,880 --> 01:14:25,803
I'm Zhang Youliang's wife.

448
01:14:25,880 --> 01:14:27,450
Bitch!

449
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:55,242
Shameless whore! I'll beat you to death!

450
01:14:55,320 --> 01:14:59,450
Did your mother give birth to you
just to seduce my husband?

451
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:28,331
Number 11, your turn.

452
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:44,130
Thank you.

453
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:51,562
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

454
01:19:33,880 --> 01:19:36,247
You have been there a long time.

455
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:39,487
You know the ropes.

456
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:45,448
If you don't know the ropes here...

457
01:19:46,360 --> 01:19:48,442
you won't earn much.

458
01:19:50,040 --> 01:19:51,849
I'd rather stay here.

459
01:20:00,720 --> 01:20:03,644
When will this airport be finished?

460
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:07,488
They're working on the runway first.

461
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:11,804
When that's finished,
most of the workers will leave.

462
01:20:11,880 --> 01:20:13,882
I'll leave too.

463
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:22,325
Mom...

464
01:20:23,320 --> 01:20:26,005
I saw Dad in Yichang.

465
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:35,042
I don't want to hear about him.

466
01:20:58,440 --> 01:21:01,125
Incredible! How could this happen?

467
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:02,406
<i>At 8:38 p.m. yesterday,</i>

468
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:07,441
<i>the Beijing to Fuzhou train
reached Shangyu, in Wenzhou.</i>

469
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:12,162
<i>There it' ran in to a stationary train
going from Hangzhou to Fuzhou.</i>

470
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:18,088
<i>The collision caused the first four carriages
to plunge from the viaduct.</i>

471
01:21:18,160 --> 01:21:20,731
<i>Two carriages from the other train also fell.</i>

472
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:24,202
<i>The current death toll stands at 35.</i>

473
01:21:24,280 --> 01:21:28,046
<i>Nineteen have been identified.
They include two foreigners.</i>

474
01:21:28,120 --> 01:21:30,566
<i>In all, 210 people were injured.</i>

475
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:06,164
- Pay the toll.
- What toll?

476
01:22:06,240 --> 01:22:07,605
Transit fee, 10 yuan.

477
01:22:07,680 --> 01:22:10,604
- We work at the airport site.
- You're most liable.

478
01:22:10,680 --> 01:22:14,127
When your trucks pass through our town,
you leave potholes.

479
01:22:14,240 --> 01:22:16,004
From today you have to pay.

480
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:19,004
- I don't drive the trucks.
- It makes no difference.

481
01:22:32,360 --> 01:22:34,442
You work at the airport?

482
01:22:34,520 --> 01:22:37,126
<i>I'll</i> pay if you give me a receipt.

483
01:22:38,760 --> 01:22:40,603
Receipt?

484
01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:48,690
Receipt.

485
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:54,364
Take care of this guy.

486
01:23:17,160 --> 01:23:18,889
Stop it, you'll kill him!

487
01:23:20,920 --> 01:23:23,321
<i>Can an animal commit suicide?</i>

488
01:23:23,400 --> 01:23:26,688
<i>For those who think that humans</i>

489
01:23:26,760 --> 01:23:31,482
<i>are the only advanced creatures
on earth -</i>

490
01:23:34,840 --> 01:23:37,286
Xiaoyu, your shift's over.

491
01:23:38,360 --> 01:23:40,362
Did you know animals commit suicide?

492
01:23:40,440 --> 01:23:42,966
So they don't know the saying:

493
01:23:43,040 --> 01:23:45,646
Better to live miserable than die happy.

494
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:47,927
Animals wouldn't agree.

495
01:24:05,800 --> 01:24:08,121
Good evening, gentlemen.

496
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:14,486
Sauna or overnight?

497
01:24:18,120 --> 01:24:20,805
Sauna, then give us a room.

498
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:24,890
Sauna. Two guests for sauna.

499
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:41,331
Washing clothes?

500
01:25:41,400 --> 01:25:42,401
Yes.

501
01:25:43,400 --> 01:25:45,641
What's your employee number?

502
01:25:45,960 --> 01:25:47,564
I don't have one.

503
01:25:49,560 --> 01:25:51,403
Give me a massage.

504
01:25:54,200 --> 01:25:56,282
Please go to the third floor.

505
01:25:56,360 --> 01:25:59,489
- The masseuses are there.
- I want an untrained person.

506
01:25:59,560 --> 01:26:02,166
Give me a full set. I'll tip you.

507
01:26:03,720 --> 01:26:07,691
Sorry, sir, I'm a receptionist,
not a masseuse.

508
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:10,445
Receptionist? Then why are you up here?

509
01:26:12,840 --> 01:26:14,524
Sorry.

510
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:33,124
What do you mean by that?

511
01:26:33,200 --> 01:26:35,202
Nothing.

512
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:51,530
Don't look down on me.

513
01:26:51,640 --> 01:26:54,723
- You'll be well paid.
- Get out.

514
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:57,644
Fuck. Stop pretending.

515
01:26:58,280 --> 01:27:00,965
- I'll have you.
- I'm not a masseuse!

516
01:27:01,040 --> 01:27:04,089
Then why are you in a sauna?

517
01:27:04,160 --> 01:27:05,764
- Get out.
- Fuck.

518
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:08,320
You've had too many pretty boys, eh?

519
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:09,890
We can afford you.

520
01:27:09,960 --> 01:27:12,964
I'm not a prostitute.
Go home to your wives.

521
01:27:26,600 --> 01:27:29,843
- Now what?
- I'm having you!

522
01:27:30,680 --> 01:27:33,286
- No, you're not!
- I'm not?

523
01:27:35,080 --> 01:27:37,287
- I have money.
- Money can't buy everything!

524
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:40,682
I have money.
Isn't it good enough?

525
01:27:43,280 --> 01:27:45,681
It's not fucking good enough?

526
01:27:47,880 --> 01:27:50,360
I'll smother you in it!

527
01:27:50,440 --> 01:27:51,726
Not a prostitute?

528
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:54,280
I'll smother you in money!

529
01:27:57,040 --> 01:27:58,246
Bitch!

530
01:27:58,320 --> 01:28:00,800
I have fucking money!

531
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:04,885
Fuck!

532
01:28:05,720 --> 01:28:06,960
Fuck you!

533
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:09,566
Isn't my money good enough?

534
01:28:09,640 --> 01:28:11,847
It's not good enough?

535
01:28:14,320 --> 01:28:16,846
Not a prostitute? Who is, then?

536
01:31:42,760 --> 01:31:46,731
<i>Hello, this is
the 110 emergency call line.</i>

537
01:31:54,440 --> 01:31:56,761
I've killed someone.

538
01:33:04,160 --> 01:33:06,162
Hands off my phone.

539
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:08,610
Where's the GPS?

540
01:33:09,440 --> 01:33:12,444
You want GPS, buy a fucking BMW.

541
01:33:12,520 --> 01:33:16,525
I'm going to see my buddy in Dongguan.
I don't know the way.

542
01:33:16,840 --> 01:33:20,811
Get a motorcycle taxi and then a train.

543
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:22,882
A high-speed train?

544
01:33:23,480 --> 01:33:27,201
- Which town in Dongguan is it?
- Humen.

545
01:33:48,520 --> 01:33:50,727
What should I do?

546
01:33:52,280 --> 01:33:56,080
The company rules say:
“No small talk during working hours.”

547
01:33:56,160 --> 01:33:59,801
The accident today was your fault.

548
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:03,285
Agreed?

549
01:34:07,560 --> 01:34:11,087
The company will pay the medical fees.

550
01:34:11,160 --> 01:34:13,447
You'll pay for the man-hours.

551
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:17,447
It'll take two weeks for his hand to heal.

552
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:22,686
For that period your wages will go to him.

553
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:25,121
You'll work for him.

554
01:35:28,720 --> 01:35:34,762
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
the next stop will be Dongguan.</i>

555
01:35:48,280 --> 01:35:50,248
Hey, buddy.

556
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:31,841
He gets my wages while he's off.

557
01:36:31,920 --> 01:36:35,367
So if he's off for 100 days
he gets 100 days' wages from me.

558
01:36:35,440 --> 01:36:39,411
Shit.
That means you work for him.

559
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:41,807
So I ran away.

560
01:36:41,880 --> 01:36:45,680
Luckily I got paid not long ago
so I'm ahead.

561
01:36:45,880 --> 01:36:49,601
Come and work here.
The factory's recruiting.

562
01:36:49,680 --> 01:36:52,684
Basic pay is 1,200 yuan,
plus meals and a bed.

563
01:36:53,240 --> 01:36:55,402
What do most people get?

564
01:36:55,480 --> 01:36:57,482
About 2,500 yuan.

565
01:36:59,240 --> 01:37:01,083
Training?

566
01:37:01,280 --> 01:37:04,250
One week, without pay.

567
01:37:05,440 --> 01:37:07,886
Anything else going?

568
01:37:11,400 --> 01:37:14,563
You could be a waiter in Changping.

569
01:37:14,880 --> 01:37:16,291
A waiter?

570
01:37:16,360 --> 01:37:19,409
In a nightclub. The johns
are from Hong Kong and Taiwan.

571
01:37:19,520 --> 01:37:22,603
They tip well. But you gotta work nights.

572
01:37:23,920 --> 01:37:28,608
- Is it far?
- Nah. It's another town in Dongguan.

573
01:37:33,720 --> 01:37:35,688
Hello, Mr. Lau.

574
01:37:43,960 --> 01:37:47,601
This guy's from my village.
Please take care of him.

575
01:37:47,680 --> 01:37:50,524
- Your buddy?
- Sure, his name's Xiaohui.

576
01:37:50,600 --> 01:37:52,967
Xiaohui, get in.

577
01:37:55,360 --> 01:37:57,362
Call me if anything comes up.

578
01:37:57,440 --> 01:37:59,488
Nothing will.

579
01:37:59,600 --> 01:38:02,410
- Look after him.
- Sure.

580
01:38:08,600 --> 01:38:12,844
When a guest arrives,
don't call him “sir.”

581
01:38:12,920 --> 01:38:17,562
From now on
he's a “distinguished guest.”

582
01:38:17,800 --> 01:38:22,089
So you say, “Good evening,
distinguished guest. Welcome.”

583
01:38:22,160 --> 01:38:23,889
Now, after me.

584
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,241
Good evening, distinguished guest.

585
01:38:26,320 --> 01:38:31,645
Good evening, distinguished guest.
Welcome to The Golden Age.

586
01:38:32,080 --> 01:38:33,081
In Cantonese.

587
01:38:38,320 --> 01:38:40,163
In English.

588
01:38:46,840 --> 01:38:49,161
Show the guest to room 214.

589
01:39:04,240 --> 01:39:06,971
- What are you doing?
- I didn't see anything.

590
01:39:07,040 --> 01:39:08,849
What didn't you see?

591
01:39:08,960 --> 01:39:11,406
I didn't see anything.

592
01:39:12,440 --> 01:39:15,523
It's okay, I'm decent.

593
01:39:17,040 --> 01:39:18,804
New here?

594
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:24,566
- Name?
- Xiaohui.

595
01:39:25,920 --> 01:39:28,924
- From Hunan?
- How'd you know that?

596
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:32,243
Easy. I recognize your accent.

597
01:39:32,360 --> 01:39:34,601
I'm from Hunan too.

598
01:39:37,120 --> 01:39:38,884
Come here.

599
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:46,882
I'm Lianrong.

600
01:39:47,280 --> 01:39:49,726
It means “lotus seed.”

601
01:39:50,360 --> 01:39:52,488
Easy to remember.

602
01:39:52,560 --> 01:39:54,324
Delicious.

603
01:39:56,600 --> 01:39:59,410
We were meant to meet here.

604
01:40:00,160 --> 01:40:04,802
Lots of people are “meant to meet here.”

605
01:40:15,240 --> 01:40:17,288
Give me a hand.

606
01:41:36,280 --> 01:41:37,691
Sir.

607
01:41:42,640 --> 01:41:44,847
I'm in Dongguan.

608
01:41:45,960 --> 01:41:48,281
A painting by Xu Beihong?

609
01:41:48,360 --> 01:41:50,044
Buy it.

610
01:41:50,120 --> 01:41:52,521
Great investment.

611
01:41:54,200 --> 01:41:57,727
Okay, see you in Macao.

612
01:41:57,840 --> 01:41:59,808
We're done.

613
01:42:30,760 --> 01:42:33,889
- Slacking?
- No.

614
01:42:39,920 --> 01:42:41,888
Aren't you slacking?

615
01:42:41,960 --> 01:42:44,566
This room has great Wi-Fi.

616
01:42:48,080 --> 01:42:50,447
Are there many guests?

617
01:42:50,520 --> 01:42:52,727
On and off.

618
01:42:52,800 --> 01:42:56,850
We have a rush around 1:00,
another at 3:00

619
01:42:56,920 --> 01:42:59,491
and another at 5:00.

620
01:43:06,080 --> 01:43:08,970
It's snowing in Shanxi and Inner Mongolia.

621
01:43:09,040 --> 01:43:12,249
It can't be.
Here in Dongguan it's still 75 °F.

622
01:43:16,440 --> 01:43:18,090
Fuck.

623
01:43:19,360 --> 01:43:22,364
At the home of a land-bureau chief

624
01:43:22,440 --> 01:43:25,762
they found
more than 130 Louis Vuitton bags.

625
01:43:25,840 --> 01:43:28,081
Why did he buy so many?

626
01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:31,770
- He's a she.
- A lady needs that many?

627
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:34,207
As I said, she's a lady.

628
01:43:39,240 --> 01:43:41,288
Let's post a comment.

629
01:43:43,160 --> 01:43:47,404
- What to write?
- WTF.

630
01:43:50,640 --> 01:43:52,688
WTF.

631
01:43:52,760 --> 01:43:55,889
The bags were worth over 2 million yuan.

632
01:43:57,080 --> 01:43:59,242
Anything else?

633
01:44:02,440 --> 01:44:05,489
A mine explosion in Shanxi.

634
01:44:05,560 --> 01:44:09,087
- Dozens dead.
- Post a comment.

635
01:44:09,160 --> 01:44:12,687
- What?
- WTF.

636
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:19,326
WTF.

637
01:44:21,160 --> 01:44:22,764
What's your handle?

638
01:44:22,840 --> 01:44:26,322
On QQ, I'm Little Bird.

639
01:44:27,400 --> 01:44:31,803
- Is it really little?
- That's going too far.

640
01:44:31,880 --> 01:44:35,009
Just lending a hand.

641
01:44:35,120 --> 01:44:37,691
You're embarrassed.

642
01:44:38,240 --> 01:44:40,208
What's your handle?

643
01:44:42,800 --> 01:44:44,404
I forgot!

644
01:45:04,480 --> 01:45:05,925
They're not dead?

645
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:10,050
- You have fish?
- I'm going to set them free tomorrow.

646
01:45:12,560 --> 01:45:14,483
Are you a Buddhist?

647
01:45:15,560 --> 01:45:17,164
Yes.

648
01:45:17,680 --> 01:45:22,766
In this line of work,
the Cantonese call us “illicit traders.”

649
01:45:22,840 --> 01:45:27,084
So we need to do lots of good deeds
to be forgiven in our next life.

650
01:45:27,160 --> 01:45:30,403
Do you understand Little Bird?

651
01:45:34,160 --> 01:45:36,242
My handle is Fish Seeks Water.

652
01:47:06,720 --> 01:47:09,883
Welcome. Room 7 is here.

653
01:47:23,960 --> 01:47:27,487
<i>Now for the first lesson
in our</i> Quick <i>Cantonese series.</i>

654
01:47:27,560 --> 01:47:32,930
<i>When you meet the right guy
you'll know what to say in Cantonese.</i>

655
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:36,083
<i>When two people
are first drawn to each other,</i>

656
01:47:36,160 --> 01:47:39,846
<i>if the boy's bold enough,
he'll say, “I like you.”</i>

657
01:47:39,920 --> 01:47:42,810
<i>There are more girls than boys
in Dongguan,</i>

658
01:47:42,880 --> 01:47:47,124
<i>so ifs quite common for a girl
to approach a boy.</i>

659
01:49:34,840 --> 01:49:37,446
I only know one sentence in Cantonese.

660
01:49:39,640 --> 01:49:41,369
Say it.

661
01:49:46,520 --> 01:49:48,568
I like you very much.

662
01:50:11,360 --> 01:50:13,362
Let's leave Dongguan.

663
01:50:19,080 --> 01:50:21,367
Where will you take me?

664
01:50:27,160 --> 01:50:30,801
As long as you're coming,
anywhere will do.

665
01:50:38,040 --> 01:50:40,646
There's no true love in sex work.

666
01:50:40,720 --> 01:50:43,087
How well do you know me?

667
01:50:45,280 --> 01:50:47,521
I have a daughter.

668
01:50:50,400 --> 01:50:52,926
That day you saw me on the train,

669
01:50:53,040 --> 01:50:55,520
I was going to see her in Guangzhou.

670
01:50:57,560 --> 01:50:59,562
She's three.

671
01:51:02,920 --> 01:51:05,082
I have to raise her.

672
01:51:30,120 --> 01:51:31,929
Leaders' Train Room.

673
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:41,090
Come in.

674
01:51:41,160 --> 01:51:43,640
I want a conductor, not a nurse.

675
01:51:43,720 --> 01:51:47,042
Won't a nurse be good?
There's your health to consider.

676
01:51:47,120 --> 01:51:48,690
That's enough.

677
01:51:48,760 --> 01:51:51,764
Go look after sick comrades.

678
01:51:51,840 --> 01:51:55,208
- But -
- I'm in excellent health.

679
01:51:55,280 --> 01:51:56,770
Leave now.

680
01:51:56,840 --> 01:51:58,922
Please wait, then.

681
01:52:00,080 --> 01:52:02,970
- Your fruit, distinguished guest.
- Leave it there.

682
01:52:29,440 --> 01:52:33,161
Distinguished guest, may I serve you?

683
01:52:33,240 --> 01:52:35,925
Address me as Chief Leader.

684
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,241
Chief Leader.

685
01:52:38,320 --> 01:52:41,688
That's better. Let's set off.

686
01:52:49,840 --> 01:52:51,604
Where to?

687
01:52:51,680 --> 01:52:54,809
You don't know where we're going?

688
01:52:54,880 --> 01:52:57,451
Wherever you want, we'll go.

689
01:52:57,520 --> 01:53:01,605
Young people nowadays
have no sense of direction.

690
01:53:01,680 --> 01:53:04,923
Any recent innovations?

691
01:53:36,600 --> 01:53:38,364
Come here.

692
01:54:41,160 --> 01:54:43,242
Have fun, buddy.

693
01:54:48,240 --> 01:54:52,723
I have no place to go.
I came here to join you.

694
01:54:54,080 --> 01:54:55,889
Consider it carefully.

695
01:54:55,960 --> 01:55:01,000
Stick with it, no walking out,
or I'd lose face.

696
01:55:01,120 --> 01:55:02,770
I know.

697
01:55:59,160 --> 01:56:03,245
OASIS OF PROSPERITY

698
01:56:53,480 --> 01:56:56,529
- Are you new here?
- I'm a trainee.

699
01:56:56,600 --> 01:56:59,524
Hello. I'm your workshop supervisor.

700
01:56:59,600 --> 01:57:03,491
Welcome to a Fortune 500 company.
Work hard.

701
01:57:03,560 --> 01:57:08,327
Top employees win trips to Taiwan
and visits to our headquarters.

702
01:57:08,400 --> 01:57:09,481
Good luck.

703
01:57:09,560 --> 01:57:12,040
- Where are you from?
- Hunan. And you?

704
01:57:12,120 --> 01:57:13,770
Taiwan.

705
01:58:02,840 --> 01:58:04,729
Hey, Mom.

706
01:58:06,760 --> 01:58:09,843
Didn't I send you money not long ago?

707
01:58:11,920 --> 01:58:14,321
I changed jobs.

708
01:58:14,440 --> 01:58:17,410
We get paid at the end of the month.

709
01:58:20,520 --> 01:58:23,683
I just checked, I'm broke.

710
01:58:26,800 --> 01:58:31,362
Why would I lie?
I'm at the bank now, I just came out.

711
01:58:35,680 --> 01:58:39,844
I don't waste money.
I can't live on nothing.

712
01:58:39,920 --> 01:58:42,366
I'm not a bank robber.

713
01:58:57,960 --> 01:59:00,725
I really don't waste money.

714
01:59:36,760 --> 01:59:40,446
Thought you could skip work?
Chang Ling wants to see you.

715
02:02:45,160 --> 02:02:47,766
- Hu Yunyun?
- Here.

716
02:02:57,920 --> 02:03:01,561
- Your name is Zheng Xiaoyu?
- Yes.

717
02:03:02,040 --> 02:03:04,122
Your ID card?

718
02:03:15,040 --> 02:03:18,328
- You're from Hubei?
- Right.

719
02:03:19,240 --> 02:03:21,846
Are you familiar with our Shengli Group?

720
02:03:22,560 --> 02:03:25,450
From the Internet, I know a bit.

721
02:03:26,840 --> 02:03:31,129
This is Mrs. Jiao.
She currently chairs our company.

722
02:03:33,360 --> 02:03:36,364
Why have you come
all the way to Shanxi for a job?

723
02:03:38,680 --> 02:03:40,887
Do you have relatives here?

724
02:03:41,320 --> 02:03:42,924
No.

725
02:03:46,600 --> 02:03:49,444
You're a bit older
than the other applicants.

726
02:03:50,040 --> 02:03:52,520
What work experience do you have?

727
02:03:53,840 --> 02:03:57,765
I used to work
in a garment factory in Guangzhou.

728
02:03:57,840 --> 02:03:59,763
Guangzhou?

729
02:04:00,520 --> 02:04:03,285
Why did you leave Guangzhou?

730
02:04:04,520 --> 02:04:06,761
I wanted a new environment.

731
02:04:07,840 --> 02:04:11,367
Your name rings a bell.

732
02:04:12,520 --> 02:04:15,171
Is that problem behind you now?

733
02:04:18,120 --> 02:04:20,122
Yes, it is.

734
02:05:08,360 --> 02:05:15,721
<i>In court,
the magistrate changes his mind</i>

735
02:05:28,800 --> 02:05:31,087
<i>He brands me,
Su San, as a murderer</i>

736
02:05:31,160 --> 02:05:34,767
<i>I cannot defend myself</i>

737
02:05:34,880 --> 02:05:40,683
<i>I am forced to confess</i>

738
02:05:40,800 --> 02:05:43,804
<i>My tears flow</i>

739
02:06:01,480 --> 02:06:05,724
Su San! Do you understand your sin?

740
02:06:07,600 --> 02:06:11,924
Do you understand your sin?

741
02:06:13,880 --> 02:06:19,569
Do you understand your sin?

742
02:06:37,594 --> 02:06:43,594
