1
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:29,000
Four, five, six,

2
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:33,960
seven, eight. Now, girls...

3
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:48,910
Come on, girls. Anybody?

4
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,620
Anybody else?

5
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,420
Jenny, again.

6
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,840
Isn't it because Mr. Rochester's blind?

7
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,340
Yes, Jenny.

8
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:04,180
I've got an English essay to do
by tomorrow morning.

9
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:07,890
Right. So the only sound I want to hear
coming through the ceiling

10
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:10,890
is the sound of sweat
dripping onto textbooks.

11
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,020
-Cello?
-No cello.

12
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:16,270
I thought we agreed
that cello was my interest or hobby.

13
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,860
It already is your interest or hobby.

14
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:22,700
So when they ask you at the Oxford
interview, "What is your interest or hobby?",

15
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:25,030
you can say the cello
and you won't be lying.

16
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,830
But you don't have to practice a hobby.

17
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:29,620
A hobby is a hobby.

18
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,870
Can I stop going
to the youth orchestra, then?

19
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:35,210
No. No, no,
the youth orchestra's a good thing.

20
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:37,090
That shows you're a joiner-inner.

21
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:40,590
Yes, but I've already joined in.

22
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:42,470
So now I can stop.

23
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:48,560
No. No, that just shows the opposite,
don't you see?

24
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:52,020
No, that shows you're a rebel.
They don't want that at Oxford.

25
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,480
No. They don't want people
who can think for themselves.

26
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,560
No, of course they don't.

27
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,860
-All right, okay. Bye.
-Bye.

28
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:43,650
Jenny?

29
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:47,110
Should I wear, like, Sunday best?

30
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,910
Better, I'm afraid.

31
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:54,370
Just to show my father you're
un jeune homme sГ©rieux, not aTeddy Boy.

32
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,710
Oh, God. Right.

33
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:01,300
I'm going to go.
It's going to bucket down in a minute.

34
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:04,210
-Okay, right.
-I'll see you at the weekend.

35
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:07,220
-Bye, then.
-Bye.

36
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,140
-Sorry.
-Sorry.

37
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:12,060
Goodbye, my love.

38
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,520
Come on, come on.
Stop it now, stop it. That's enough.

39
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:26,110
Now look what you've done.

40
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:30,660
-The nice man's waiting for us.
-It fell off.

41
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:33,700
No, it didn't fall off. You kicked it off.
Now come on.

42
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:35,660
My sock's all wet.

43
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,430
Hello.

44
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:52,010
Look, if you had any sense,
you wouldn't take a lift from a strange man.

45
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:55,850
But I'm a music lover
and I'm worried about your cello.

46
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:59,900
So what I propose is you put it in my car
and walk alongside me.

47
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:05,820
How do I know
you won't just drive off with the cello?

48
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,280
Good point.

49
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:13,490
How much does a new cello cost? ВЈ10, ВЈ15?
I don't know.

50
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:15,910
Let's say 15.

51
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,710
No? All right.

52
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:21,630
Up to you.

53
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:32,680
And that?

54
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,680
-I'm David, by the way.
-Jenny.

55
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:41,100
Very good.

56
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:55,080
-How did the concert go?
-It was a rehearsal.

57
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,250
-The concert's next Thursday.
-What are you playing?

58
00:06:58,330 --> 00:06:59,620
Elgar.

59
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:03,750
I think it's a shame he spent so much time
in Worcester, don't you?

60
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,090
Because Worcester is too near Birmingham,
and you can hear that in the music.

61
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:11,340
There's a terrible Brummy accent in there,
if you listen hard enough.

62
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:16,300
Anyway, Elgar and the Jews
don't mix very well.

63
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:19,350
-I'm not a Jew.
-No, I am.

64
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,020
I wasn't accusing you.

65
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,360
Can I sit in the car with my cello?

66
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,240
Jump in.

67
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,460
I've never seen a car like this before.

68
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:48,250
It's a Bristol. Not many of them made.

69
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,970
-Where to, madam?
-I only live round the corner.

70
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,340
-Worse luck.
-I'll see what I can do.

71
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:16,110
I suppose cellists must go
to a lot of concerts?

72
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,490
We don't go to any concerts.

73
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:21,540
-We don't believe in them.
-They're real.

74
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,120
So people say.

75
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,750
-Smoke?
-I'd better not.

76
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,590
I live just up there.

77
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,800
Why don't we believe in them?

78
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,510
He'd say there's no point to them.

79
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,890
-Your father, this is?
-Oh, yes.

80
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:42,020
They're just for fun.

81
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:46,440
Apart from school concerts,
which are no fun at all, so we go to those.

82
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:48,520
They don't help you get on.

83
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:51,690
Which, of course,
is what's so wonderful about them.

84
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:54,650
-Anyway, you'll go one day.
-I know, I will.

85
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:59,450
If I get to university,
I'm going to read what I want

86
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:01,830
and listen to what I want,

87
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:05,410
and I'm going to look at paintings
and watch French films,

88
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:09,080
and I'm going to talk to people
who know lots about lots.

89
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:11,840
-Good for you.
-Yes.

90
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,800
-Which university?
-Oxford. If I'm lucky.

91
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,590
Did you go anywhere?

92
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,390
I study what I believe they call
"the university of life."

93
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:25,270
I didn't get a very good degree, though.

94
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:32,020
Well, thank you for driving me home.

95
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:42,200
-Are you all right? Have you got it?
-Yes, it's fine.

96
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:46,830
-Thank you.
-My pleasure.

97
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:27,370
I don't want to hear any French singing.

98
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:31,210
French singing wasn't on the syllabus
last time I looked.

99
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:34,540
-Battenberg?
-Thank you.

100
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:38,880
I actually like the crust. I'll take it.

101
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,680
So where are you applying, Graham?

102
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,800
I'm not sure yet.

103
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:45,810
When will you be sure?

104
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:48,640
You can't let the grass grow under your feet,
young man.

105
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:50,940
I might take a year off.

106
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:52,190
What for?

107
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:55,690
I don't know, maybe do some traveling.

108
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,190
That sort of thing.

109
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:00,900
Traveling?

110
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,740
What are you, a Teddy Boy?

111
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,950
You know she's going to Oxford, don't you?

112
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,960
If we get her Latin up to scratch.

113
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,380
So while she's studying English at Oxford,

114
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,630
you'll be the wandering Jew.

115
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:20,670
Mr. Millar, I'm not a Teddy Boy.

116
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:25,930
I'm an homme sГ©rieux jeune.

117
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:28,770
No. Yeah.

118
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:32,270
I'm a homme jeune sГ©rieux.

119
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:48,280
-They're for me.
-Who are they from?

120
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,420
-Gosh. Him.
-What's this?

121
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:58,840
Jack, I'm afraid Jenny's been sent
some flowers from a chap.

122
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,210
-A chap? What kind of chap?
-He's wishing me luck for tonight.

123
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,840
Is that all he's wishing you?
Where'd he get the money from?

124
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:07,180
-He earns it, I expect.
-Earns it? Why isn't he at school?

125
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:10,720
Can we just go? Otherwise the good luck
flowers will actually be responsible

126
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:15,100
for me actually missing the concert,
which would be ironic, n'est-ce pas?

127
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:21,570
-I don't like it.
-Objection noted.

128
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:23,150
-Jenny?
-Noted.

129
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,660
There's got to be 10 bobs' worth
of luck here. I mean...

130
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:30,540
That's a bit much for a schoolgirl, isn't it?
We can't leave it here.

131
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,750
Even I'd burgle a house
with flowers left outside.

132
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:34,500
They'll think we're made of money.

133
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:36,330
Thank you, Marjorie.

134
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:42,010
Camus doesn't want you to like him.
Feeling is bourgeois.

135
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:44,920
Being engagГ©e is bourgeois.

136
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:48,090
He kills someone
and he doesn't feel anything.

137
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:51,260
His mother dies
and he doesn't feel anything.

138
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:56,230
I wouldn't feel anything if my mother died.
Does that make me an existentialist?

139
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:58,020
No. That makes you a cow.

140
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:04,440
Well, after I've been to university,

141
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:08,530
I'm going to be French
and I'm going to Paris,

142
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:13,120
and I'm going to smoke
and wear black and listen to Jacques Brel,

143
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,460
and I won't speak, ever.

144
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,000
-Oh, crikey!
-What?

145
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,170
Wait here.

146
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,880
Hello!

147
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:35,270
Hello.

148
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:37,560
Thank you.

149
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:40,150
How did it go?

150
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,480
Fine, I think. I didn't mess my bit up.

151
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,700
Nobody got thrown out
of the orchestra afterwards.

152
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:50,200
Always the mark of a cultural triumph.

153
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,990
Listen, I'm glad I ran into you.
What are you doing on Friday?

154
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:56,120
-Going to school.
-I meant in the evening.

155
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,920
Of course. Nothing.

156
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Because I'm going to listen to some Ravel
in St. John's, Smith Square.

157
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:07,260
My friends Danny and Helen
would be coming, too, so it wouldn't be...

158
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:11,050
I'll tell you what, I'll come and pick you up,

159
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,470
and if your mother and father disapprove,

160
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,260
then you can have the tickets
and go with one of them.

161
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:16,520
-How does that sound?
-Thank you.

162
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,770
And I'd like to go with you.

163
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,560
7:00.

164
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,270
What are they saying?

165
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:28,070
And probably go for
a spot of supper afterwards.

166
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:31,160
-Supper?
-If you want to.

167
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:37,040
Well the thing is, we'll probably have eaten.

168
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,960
Well, if you'd like supper,

169
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:43,880
then perhaps on Friday you could not eat?

170
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,050
Yes. Of course.

171
00:14:58,310 --> 00:14:59,730
A spot of supper?

172
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:02,480
-You've heard of supper.
-We've heard of it, we've never eaten it.

173
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,230
So you're going to have
to tell us everything.

174
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,400
Otherwise it's not fair.

175
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,820
-I won't allow it!
-Fine.

176
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:12,030
-He's more than happy for you to take me.
-Fine, I will.

177
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:13,530
-Good.
-Well, where is it?

178
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,490
-Saint John's, Smith Square.
-Where's that?

179
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,080
I don't know. I'm sure we could find out.

180
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,700
It's in Westminster.
Right next door to the Abbey.

181
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:20,910
How'd you know that?

182
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,210
I had a life
before we were married, you know.

183
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:24,540
You soon put a stop to that.

184
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:26,590
-Well, there you are.
-Where are we?

185
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:29,510
We're near Westminster Abbey.
I'm not going all the way over there.

186
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:32,380
The trouble is,
that's where St. John's, Smith Square is.

187
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:34,470
There must be something on locally.
Where's the paper?

188
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:36,300
She wants to see someone who can play.

189
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:40,100
She doesn't want to see Sheila Kirkland
scratching away. I'll take her.

190
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:43,020
And how do you propose to get there?
RAF helicopter?

191
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:46,230
-That's him.
-Bloody hell !

192
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,400
Jack!

193
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:51,820
By the way, David's a Jew.
A wandering Jew. So watch yourself.

194
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,570
What does she mean by that?
I've never said anything like that.

195
00:15:56,660 --> 00:16:00,200
It's just an expression.
I've got nothing against the Jews.

196
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:02,830
Glad to hear it. Hello.

197
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,380
I didn't mean I've got nothing against you.
No, of course I do mean that.

198
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:09,420
-Dad.
-No. It's a... Sorry. It's just that...

199
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:14,800
You're not the sort of person
that I would be against.

200
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:17,180
Well, I wouldn't, because
I'm not the kind of person

201
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:20,470
who would be against people.

202
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:25,600
I'm Jack. This is my wife, Marjorie.

203
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,230
You didn't tell me you had a sister, Jenny.

204
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,900
Please.

205
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:37,450
You're a lucky man, Jack.

206
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:40,240
Yes, I suppose I am.

207
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:51,800
-This is lovely.
-Thank you.

208
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:55,760
I'm sorry, David. Would you like a drink?

209
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:59,510
I'd love one, Jack,
but we're running a little late.

210
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,430
If Jenny's ready, perhaps we'll shoot off?

211
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:07,480
Actually, David,
Dad has something he has to tell you.

212
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:14,030
No, no. Really.
It was just a question, a point of reference.

213
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:18,910
What's the best way to get to
St. John's, Smith Square from here?

214
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:21,280
It's a straight run, really.
Up to Hammersmith,

215
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:23,330
take the A4 through Kensington,
you're there.

216
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:26,040
-As simple as that?
-As simple as that.

217
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:28,710
-Shall I book us some tickets?
-No.

218
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,460
Well, have her back by 10:00, David.

219
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:36,420
I was hoping
she might come with me afterwards

220
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:39,300
for a spot of supper with my Aunt Helen.

221
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:41,470
Oh, well...

222
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:46,230
No, no. She's usually in bed by then.

223
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:49,980
What if I promise to have her back by 11:30?

224
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:53,690
Well, it's Friday night,

225
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:56,570
and you are going all the way
to the West End.

226
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:58,860
Thanks, Jack. I appreciate it.

227
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:00,820
All right.

228
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:04,410
-Bye.
-Bye-bye.

229
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,160
Have a nice time.

230
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,010
Come on.

231
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,350
Hello, hello.

232
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,720
Are we late?

233
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:27,520
No, I thought
we were going to miss the beginning,

234
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,770
and then it wouldn't be worth going in

235
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:30,690
and we could all go off dancing
or something.

236
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:33,730
Helen is one of the more reluctant members
of tonight's audience.

237
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,150
-Hello. Hello.
-Jenny, these are my friends,

238
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:37,320
Helen and Danny. Shall we?

239
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,200
-Hello.
-All right?

240
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,830
-Sorry.
-That's all right. It's lovely, isn't it?

241
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:53,000
It's beautiful. Where did you get it from?

242
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,500
I don't know. Chelsea, somewhere.

243
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:03,470
Yours is...
Well, good for this sort of concert, isn't it?

244
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:04,890
Thank you.

245
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:08,470
We should go shopping together one day,
you and I, if you want.

246
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,730
That would be nice.

247
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:15,440
But Chelsea,
c'est beaucoup trop cher pour moi.

248
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,320
Sorry?

249
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:21,070
I just said, "It's too expensive for me."

250
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,570
No, you didn't.
You said something completely different.

251
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:26,740
No, well... I said it in French.

252
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:28,410
In French. Why?

253
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:31,080
I don't know.

254
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:35,040
Well, Chelsea's too expensive
for me, too, really,

255
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:37,340
but we don't have to worry about that.

256
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:41,010
If you want something in Chelsea,
just get David to take you shopping.

257
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:43,840
Why would David want
to take me shopping?

258
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,940
I booked a table at Juliette's.
Will that kill the mood, do you think?

259
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,820
I hope so.

260
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,360
God, I always think
I'm going to my own funeral

261
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,820
when I listen to classical music.

262
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:46,910
That was classical, wasn't it?

263
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:49,530
Yes. Very classical.
As classical as you can get.

264
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:50,620
Juliette's it is, then.

265
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:54,540
Heaven forbid we should end the evening
reflecting on our own mortality.

266
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:17,810
Miles Davis, Sartre...

267
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:21,610
Extraordinary woman, GrГ©co.
Just like you, Helen.

268
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:26,570
What about Chante FranГ§oise Sagan?
Have you heard that one?

269
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:27,780
It's wonderful.

270
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:31,700
I've only got...
I think it's just called Juliette GrГ©co.

271
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,700
The one with the eyes on the sleeve?

272
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:37,000
I saved up and got my French Conversation
teacher to bring it back after Christmas.

273
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,790
-You've got a French Conversation teacher?
-Yes.

274
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:43,250
Is that why you suddenly speak French,
for no reason?

275
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,470
Have you never heard her sing?
She's marvelous.

276
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:48,720
You should see her in Paris,
though, not here.

277
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,550
David will take you.

278
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:55,810
-I'd love to. You'd fit right in.
-Better than here, really.

279
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:59,230
Isn't it wonderful to find a young person
who wants to know things?

280
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:01,810
There's so much I want you to see.

281
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,280
Are you all right to come and have a look

282
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,820
at that Pembroke Villas place
with me on Friday, Danny?

283
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:14,790
No, I can't. There's a Burne-Jones
coming up at Christie's on Friday.

284
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:16,250
Desperate to get my hands on it.

285
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:19,920
You're thinking of buying a Burne-Jones?
A real one?

286
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:23,000
I just have a feeling
the Pre-Raphaelites are going to take off.

287
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:25,380
-I love the Pre-Raphaelites.
-Do you?

288
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:28,670
Yes, of course.
Rossetti and Burne-Jones, anyway.

289
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:32,180
-Not Holman Hunt so much, he's so garish.
-Absolutely.

290
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,310
Why don't we all go to the auction together?

291
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:38,930
-Auction ! Gosh, how exciting.
-Yes, Friday morning.

292
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:43,520
Friday.

293
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,440
You're busy?

294
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:48,990
Well, yes.

295
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:59,120
-Are you sure you're busy?
-No. I'm sure I could rearrange.

296
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:02,290
That would be lovely.

297
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:18,580
What are you doing?

298
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:23,210
I can't get this casserole dish clean,
it's all burnt round.

299
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:24,920
It's 25 to 12:00.

300
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:28,960
We finished tea at 7:00.

301
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,960
I know what time it is.

302
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:33,970
How was your evening?

303
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:36,890
Best night of my life.

304
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:46,560
Night, Mum.

305
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:58,490
I think there were two violins,
one cello, two violas, a harp...

306
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,240
I don't want to hear about Ravel.

307
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:02,240
I want to know
what else was on the program.

308
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:04,830
It was nothing like that.
He was a perfect gentleman.

309
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,170
He just said he wanted to take me places
and show me things.

310
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:09,630
-Things!
-Plural. My God.

311
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:13,210
I knew that Jane Eyre
would eventually work its magic on you.

312
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:15,720
I'm assuming that's what
you're all so animated about.

313
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:19,140
-Of course.
-Jane Eyre and Jenny's new boyfriend.

314
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:20,510
He's not my new boyfriend.

315
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,430
That's true.
He's more of a man friend, actually.

316
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:25,560
-He's got a sports car, Miss Stubbs.
-It's maroon.

317
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,310
So could we call him a Mr. Rochester figure?

318
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,610
I think he must be as blind as Mr. Rochester.

319
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:33,860
You may or may not have noticed
I'm trying to steer the subject away

320
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:36,900
from Jenny's lurid love life
into the matter in hand.

321
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:38,360
And it is clear from this evidence

322
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:40,370
that most of you know
far too much about the former

323
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:42,450
and next to nothing about the latter.

324
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:46,210
Reluctantly, I have to admit
that Jenny is clearly an expert on both.

325
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:48,370
Excellent as always, Jenny.

326
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,930
-Hello.
-Hello.

327
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:25,080
Any further bids?

328
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,830
Sold, then, for 60 guineas.

329
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,250
Hello.

330
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:29,830
You're late.

331
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:34,550
We now turn to Lot 41.

332
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:37,970
The Tree of Forgiveness
by Sir Edward Burne-Jones.

333
00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:42,930
This is a rare opportunity to purchase
a key work of the Pre-Raphaelite movement.

334
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:45,390
Who will start me off at 100 guineas?

335
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:48,140
-Is it that one?
-Yes, that's the one.

336
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,020
50 guineas?

337
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:54,480
20 guineas? Thank you.

338
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,780
40? Thank you, sir.

339
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,030
-Do I hear 60?
-Really?

340
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:03,370
80 guineas? Thank you, sir.

341
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:06,620
Another one, madam? 100 guineas?

342
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:08,200
120?

343
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:14,130
No further bids?

344
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:16,250
-Your turn.
-What?

345
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:18,670
-Any further bids?
-Your turn.

346
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,010
-Any more?
-Quick!

347
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:23,340
120 guineas from the very eager,
new bidder.

348
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:27,890
140, madam? Thank you. 160 guineas?

349
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,310
180? Thank you.

350
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,560
200 guineas?

351
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:35,770
220?

352
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:40,400
Another one, madam?

353
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:50,660
Sold for 200 guineas. Thank you.

354
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:53,870
-Your name, please?
-Millar.

355
00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:58,840
Now we move on to Lot 42...

356
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:01,920
Thank you very much. I couldn't possibly
have bought it without you.

357
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:06,350
Just a couple of years ago,
you could pick one of them up for 50 quid.

358
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:10,020
-No one was interested.
-I would have been so interested.

359
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:13,600
As you can see, I just love things.

360
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:19,650
That's not a Lockey-Hill.

361
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:22,860
There aren't many people
who come in here and say that.

362
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:25,990
-No, certainly not me.
-It's beautiful.

363
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:27,070
-Do you play?
-Thank you.

364
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,160
I used to.

365
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,790
I vowed to myself that one day
I would own one of these,

366
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:31,790
and now I do own one,
I don't touch the bugger.

367
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:34,460
It's vulgar, really, putting it on display.

368
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:36,540
Give it to Jenny.

369
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:39,590
-I think that would be even more vulgar.
-Play for us, Jenny.

370
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:43,550
-No, one day when I'm good enough.
-She's good enough now.

371
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:46,590
David, you've never seen me play.

372
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:49,390
I can come and hear you in Oxford,
when you get there.

373
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:51,470
We should all go
and spend a weekend in Oxford.

374
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:54,480
Straw boaters, punting, cream teas...

375
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:57,230
-Boats.
-...antiquarian book shops.

376
00:28:57,310 --> 00:29:01,070
Bit of business, if we can find it.
What about next weekend?

377
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:03,150
Yes.

378
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,610
I wouldn't be allowed to do that.

379
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,370
I'll talk to them.

380
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:14,040
You're going to ask my father
if you can take me away for the weekend?

381
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,620
-He'd have you arrested.
-We'll see.

382
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,710
-I bet you can't.
-How much?

383
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:23,760
I'd be careful if I were you, Jenny.
You don't know who you're dealing with.

384
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,920
Half a crown.

385
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:27,340
You're on.

386
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:31,640
How do you know Danny?

387
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:35,770
You know, we kept bumping into each other.

388
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:38,770
Then we became pals,

389
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:41,400
and we've ended up doing
a bit of business together when it suits us.

390
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:45,030
-What kind of business?
-Property, a bit of art dealing.

391
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:49,490
Some buying and selling. This and that.

392
00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:00,580
-Right. I'll just be two ticks.
-Okay.

393
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:16,680
-Mr. Goldman, good to see you.
-Jolly good. Madam. All right.

394
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:25,230
-All right, I've got this one. And...
-Put me down !

395
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,320
Go on, then.

396
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,900
Sorry about that.

397
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,330
How do you know those negro people?

398
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:17,620
-They're clients.
-Clients?

399
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:21,290
Schvartzers have to live somewhere.

400
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:24,840
It's not as if they can rent
off their own kind, is it?

401
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:35,640
Test results for the Virgil translation.
We'll start from the bottom.

402
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:39,770
Patricia? Absent.

403
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:43,480
Margaret, 48%.

404
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:46,020
Jenny,

405
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,360
52%.

406
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:55,120
That would just about scrape a pass
in the exam proper.

407
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,080
Not good enough for Oxford candidates.

408
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:07,630
-It's her Latin, isn't it?
-Everyone's doing their best, Jack.

409
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,300
But what if everyone's best
isn't good enough?

410
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:12,130
What do we do then?

411
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,720
Well, perhaps the whole thing's
been a waste of money, anyway.

412
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,760
You don't mean that.

413
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:19,470
Well, what's she going to do
with an English degree?

414
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:22,480
If she's going to spend three years
playing that bloody cello

415
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,900
talking in French to a bunch of beatniks,

416
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:28,020
well, I'm just throwing
good money after bad.

417
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:32,240
She might meet a nice lawyer there, but she
could do that at a dinner dance tomorrow.

418
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:35,450
Because that's the point
of an Oxford education, isn't it, Dad?

419
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:38,280
It's the expensive alternative
to a dinner dance.

420
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:40,490
What about private tuition?

421
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:44,750
Can anybody hear me?
How much is this going to cost me?

422
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:47,380
Five shillings an hour.
Maybe a little more for A-level.

423
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:50,460
Five bob? We spend five bob here,
we spend five bob there.

424
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:52,210
Next thing you know,
that's our savings down the drain.

425
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:55,630
And what else are we spending five bob on?
What else are we spending six pence on?

426
00:32:55,720 --> 00:33:00,140
Nothing. No. Nothing.
All of this is free. This vase is free.

427
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:02,140
It was, actually.
It was a present from Auntie Vi.

428
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:06,270
That chair, this sofa, it's all free.
We didn't have to pay for any of it.

429
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:08,900
You see, that's the beauty of life, Jenny.

430
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:10,730
You don't have to pay for anything.

431
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:13,780
You know, there's a lovely Oxford tree
growing in the garden.

432
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:16,410
Lucky for you,
because that's Oxford taken care of.

433
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:20,160
And there's a whole orchard of school trees,
so that school is free,

434
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,790
and I think there's even
a private tuition tree in there.

435
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:24,750
-I'll just go and check, shall I?
-Jack!

436
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:27,000
That's all right, Marjorie.
Don't worry, I'll only be a second,

437
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:31,000
because I think there's a whole clump
of them surrounding the pocket money tree.

438
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:33,380
I'll just go and make sure
they're all nice and safe, shall I?

439
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:34,720
And by the way, you might be lucky.

440
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,680
There might be a man
with deep pockets growing out there,

441
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,720
because God knows
you're going to need one.

442
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:49,310
Well, you can always go
to secretarial college with Hattie.

443
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,480
-Oh, thanks.
-Charming !

444
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:56,530
-Oh, God. No.
-Hello.

445
00:33:56,610 --> 00:33:58,610
Hello, Graham.

446
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:01,870
I haven't seen you in ages.

447
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:09,540
It went a bit wrong, didn't it?
The tea party, I mean.

448
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:17,130
Was it because of the year off thing?
Because, I...

449
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:18,300
No!

450
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:23,970
I just have so much work to do
if I'm going to get the grades I need.

451
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:27,310
Yeah, she doesn't have time for boys.

452
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:37,240
-Bye, Graham !
-Bye.

453
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:53,040
And I'll tell you what the first thing
my grandfather did when he retired...

454
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,470
...was to say to my grandmother
when she expired.

455
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:05,010
-You do all the Goons?
-No, my Eccles is no good.

456
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:07,430
-Oh, no, you've got him.
-No, no.

457
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:10,310
I can't do it.

458
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:12,060
-Hello.
-This piece of paper.

459
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:16,780
Jenny.
David does the most fantastic Bluebottle.

460
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:20,490
-You came to see my parents?
-Why is that so hard to imagine?

461
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:24,240
Why are you drinking? It's not Christmas.

462
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:26,330
Well, there's a lot you don't know
about us, young lady.

463
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:29,200
-We had a life before you came along.
-That's true.

464
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:31,460
I'm only going on
what I've seen for the last 16 years.

465
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:35,880
I'm trying to think what you missed.
Nothing much comes to mind.

466
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:43,050
Anyway, I've got a huge pile
of Latin translation to do.

467
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:46,140
But you didn't tell us David went to Oxford.

468
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:50,680
-No! I didn't.
-For all the good it did me.

469
00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:53,190
-Isn't that funny?
-Extraordinary.

470
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:57,980
I was just telling Jack
that I'm going back next weekend.

471
00:35:58,070 --> 00:36:00,400
I go and visit my old English professor
every now and again.

472
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:04,320
See, that's what you need, Jenny.
Someone on the inside track.

473
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:07,530
-It's not always what you know, is it, David?
-Too true.

474
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:11,750
-Have you ever come across Clive Lewis?
-Dad's never come across anyone.

475
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:16,330
He wrote a children's book called
The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe

476
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:19,750
-that did very well, I believe.
-C. S. Lewis.

477
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,420
Well, to us he was just the old codger
who taught Medieval Literature,

478
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:24,840
but I came to know him very well.

479
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:27,800
We just got along.

480
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:31,770
Jenny used to devour those books.

481
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:33,690
I'd love to meet him.

482
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:41,690
I'm sorry, am I being slow on the uptake?

483
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:44,360
Would Jenny like to come at the weekend?

484
00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:49,280
Not this weekend,
but sometime perhaps, yes.

485
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:51,790
How often do you see him?

486
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:54,620
Not very often. Every couple of years.

487
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:58,290
Maybe next time.

488
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:01,760
Well, I suppose...

489
00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:06,050
Would she have to stay the night?

490
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:10,310
I wouldn't recommend driving home
after one of those Oxford dinners.

491
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:16,850
Clive could get her a room at the college.
It's easy enough.

492
00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:20,730
Seems like too good an opportunity
to pass up.

493
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:25,950
It wouldn't be a bother, would it, David?

494
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,240
Come on !

495
00:37:31,330 --> 00:37:34,410
Just putting a few things in a bag.
Don't worry!

496
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:45,090
Come on !

497
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:48,010
We're nearly ready. Be there in two ticks.

498
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,140
How can they only be nearly ready?

499
00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:55,850
I wouldn't be surprised
if three of them came out of there.

500
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:58,560
It's the only explanation.
They're making themselves a friend.

501
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:00,610
Ladies, come on, let's go!

502
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:04,110
There, have a look in the corner.
Open the door.

503
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:06,950
You should keep that one, if you want it.

504
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:11,910
-One can only wear so many in one day.
-Thank you.

505
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:15,450
What about tonight?
Have you got a pretty enough nightie?

506
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:19,790
Won't I be sharing a room with you?

507
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:22,000
You haven't slept with him?

508
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:25,550
-No.
-Good for you.

509
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:28,840
-Really, do you think so?
-Yes! Well, you're only 16.

510
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:33,510
-You don't want to get preggers, do you?
-No. No, I wouldn't let that happen.

511
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,220
I want to wait until I'm 17.

512
00:38:35,310 --> 00:38:38,230
-On my 17th birthday, hopefully.
-With David?

513
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:43,150
-Oh, golly, it will be with David, won't it?
-If that's what you want.

514
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:45,610
Anyway, I'll find you a nightie.

515
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:03,790
Shall we make a move?

516
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:34,780
-Can't we get out and have a look around?
-Later. If we have time.

517
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:38,290
-Imagine spending three years here.
-I know.

518
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,760
Why are university girls so strange-looking?

519
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:51,260
They can't all have started off that way,
can they?

520
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:54,720
I mean, most girls aren't born ugly,
but most girl students seem to be.

521
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,510
So there must be something
about these places

522
00:39:56,600 --> 00:40:00,020
that make you fat or spotty or short-sighted.

523
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:04,230
Well, when you look at it like that,
I mean, that's proper scientific analysis.

524
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:06,480
You can't argue with science.

525
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,820
I still don't quite understand
what you want to do when you get here.

526
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:12,650
I want to read English.

527
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:14,860
-Books.
-Sorry?

528
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:17,240
You want to read English books?

529
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:20,450
Reading English
is just another way of saying...

530
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:23,000
Don't worry, Jenny.
You're wasting your breath.

531
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:25,830
Anyway, tomorrow
we'll get more of a feel for the place.

532
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,710
Absolutely.
This place will be good for a little business.

533
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,550
All those little old ladies wandering around.

534
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:33,800
-Old ladies?
-This place is rife with stats.

535
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:38,010
Please explain what stats are.
You're always going on about them.

536
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:40,600
-It isn't very interesting.
-But you two are interested.

537
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,850
That's because we're not
very interesting either.

538
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,730
-Oh, no, they're not, really.
-It's true.

539
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:47,400
That's why we need you here.
To save us from ourselves.

540
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:50,730
Yeah, to put some intelligence and culture
into our brutal lives.

541
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:54,650
-Sing to us, sing to us.
-Please don't make me sing for you.

542
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:57,370
Please don't make us talk about work.

543
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:05,000
So, now, is he Clive, do you think, or C. S.?

544
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,790
I'm confused now.
I thought you made him up?

545
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,170
No, we...

546
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:11,050
Never mind.

547
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:15,630
"To dear Jenny,
with the pleasure of meeting you.

548
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:18,260
"Come and see me again soon, Clive."

549
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,180
Dirty old man.

550
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,560
So?

551
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:40,700
We've got these exact same curtains
at home.

552
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:43,040
Let's not talk about curtains.

553
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:46,790
You look beautiful.

554
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:49,880
David.

555
00:41:52,090 --> 00:41:54,510
There's something you should know.

556
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:00,350
I'm a virgin,

557
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:03,260
and I want to stay that way until I'm 17.

558
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:07,690
I think that's good. I think it's right.

559
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:18,820
We can still be romantic though, can't we?

560
00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:26,830
Yes, of course. As long as it's not actually...

561
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:28,120
Minnie.

562
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:30,960
Is that me?

563
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:36,050
Yes. You're my Minnie Mouse

564
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:40,970
and I'm your bubbalub.

565
00:42:44,010 --> 00:42:47,140
Okay. If that's what you want to do.

566
00:42:49,310 --> 00:42:51,100
-Minnie.
-Yes, David.

567
00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:55,650
Bubbalub.

568
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:06,580
May I have a look?

569
00:43:08,410 --> 00:43:09,830
Just a peek.

570
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:13,840
You just want to see them?

571
00:43:53,710 --> 00:43:55,040
Thank you.

572
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:16,560
-I think there's a house for sale around here.
-Really?

573
00:44:21,070 --> 00:44:22,900
Might be worth a look.

574
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:34,580
Jenny!

575
00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:37,000
-Aren't you coming?
-We don't go in.

576
00:44:37,090 --> 00:44:38,960
What are you talking about?

577
00:44:39,050 --> 00:44:41,510
Why don't you go and get
a nice cup of tea somewhere?

578
00:44:41,590 --> 00:44:42,760
Helen will look after you.

579
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:45,340
I don't need looking after,
thank you very much. David !

580
00:44:45,430 --> 00:44:48,720
I'm not going to tell you a second time.
Run along.

581
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:02,240
-Well, they won't be long, either way.
-Either way?

582
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:05,660
Well, sometimes they find something
and sometimes they don't.

583
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:09,950
And when they do find something,
we often have to leave quite quickly.

584
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:12,540
They can be quite naughty sometimes.

585
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:15,210
-Thank you.
-Cheerio.

586
00:45:15,290 --> 00:45:17,630
Catch. Careful. Careful.

587
00:45:19,590 --> 00:45:20,800
Come on.

588
00:45:21,710 --> 00:45:24,550
-Helen !
-Pass it back. Good.

589
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,350
-Jenny!
-What?

590
00:45:29,430 --> 00:45:33,140
You can stand there if you like,
but I wouldn't recommend it.

591
00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:51,660
Jenny!

592
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:56,790
Sorry about being
a little brisk back there, Jenny.

593
00:45:57,250 --> 00:46:00,330
It's just the way we do things. Silly, really.

594
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:18,310
Here, don't forget your case.

595
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:21,230
-Who's coming up for a drink?
-Me.

596
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:24,030
No, you go. I'll make my own way home.

597
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:36,870
Jenny!

598
00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:53,140
It's an old map. A Speed.

599
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:56,270
The poor dear didn't even know what it was.
What a waste.

600
00:46:56,350 --> 00:47:01,980
It shouldn't spend its life on a wall
in wherever the hell we were.

601
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:05,570
It should be with us.
We know how to look after it properly.

602
00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:09,240
-We liberated it.
-Liberated? That's one word for it.

603
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:12,570
Don't be bourgeois, Jenny.
You're better than that.

604
00:47:13,910 --> 00:47:17,910
You drink everything I put in front of you,
down in one,

605
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,500
then you slam your glass down on the bar
and ask for more.

606
00:47:21,580 --> 00:47:23,130
It's wonderful.

607
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:27,340
We're not clever like you
so we have to be clever in other ways,

608
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:31,970
because if we weren't,
there would be no fun.

609
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:36,430
We have to be clever with maps, and...

610
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,310
You want to know what stats are?

611
00:47:38,390 --> 00:47:41,890
Stats are old ladies
who are scared of colored people.

612
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:43,940
So we move the coloreds in,

613
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:47,280
and the old ladies move out,
and I buy their flats cheap.

614
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:50,240
That's what I do. So now you know.

615
00:47:51,990 --> 00:47:57,290
And, if you don't like it, I'll understand,

616
00:47:57,370 --> 00:48:01,790
and you can go back to Twickenham
and listen to the Home Service

617
00:48:03,210 --> 00:48:06,540
and do your Latin homework,

618
00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:10,170
but these weekends
and the restaurants and the concerts,

619
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:12,300
they don't grow on trees.

620
00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:18,310
This is who we are, Jenny.

621
00:48:40,330 --> 00:48:41,830
That's better.

622
00:48:58,140 --> 00:49:00,350
-Come on, you two.
-Come on up!

623
00:49:02,350 --> 00:49:04,190
You can have my olive.

624
00:49:06,150 --> 00:49:07,230
Come on.

625
00:49:23,750 --> 00:49:26,210
I suppose you have homework to do.

626
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:38,010
You have no idea
how boring everything was before I met you.

627
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:43,220
"Action is character,"
our English teacher says.

628
00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:46,980
I think it means
that if we never did anything,

629
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:48,980
we wouldn't be anybody.

630
00:49:50,150 --> 00:49:52,980
And I never did anything before I met you.

631
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:58,490
And sometimes I think no one's ever done
anything in this whole stupid country,

632
00:49:58,570 --> 00:50:00,160
apart from you.

633
00:50:37,110 --> 00:50:38,610
-Okay.
-Right.

634
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:44,580
There you are. Night.

635
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:02,010
Marjorie, look at this.

636
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:09,190
"Clive." Lucky girl.

637
00:51:10,270 --> 00:51:12,860
Never a dull moment with David, eh?

638
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:14,900
Better than that young man
you brought home for tea.

639
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:16,900
David's a lot older than Graham.

640
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:18,820
Graham could live to be 200 years old,

641
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:20,610
you'll never see him swanning around
with famous authors.

642
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:21,780
Hasn't got it in him.

643
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:24,030
Graham might become a famous author,
for all you know.

644
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:26,580
Becoming one
isn't the same as knowing one.

645
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:28,830
That shows you're well connected.

646
00:51:28,910 --> 00:51:31,250
A very impressive young man, your David.

647
00:51:31,330 --> 00:51:34,790
I must admit, life's a little brighter
with him around.

648
00:51:38,670 --> 00:51:40,970
Come on, girls, get a move on.

649
00:51:46,310 --> 00:51:48,180
What the hell are those?

650
00:51:48,270 --> 00:51:50,270
Russian Sobranies.

651
00:51:50,350 --> 00:51:51,440
Where did they come from?

652
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:55,560
Well, she probably bought them
from the Savoy, or Claridge's,

653
00:51:55,650 --> 00:51:58,230
or the opera or some fancy nightclub.

654
00:51:58,320 --> 00:51:59,820
Who knows with Jenny?

655
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:02,400
Paris. You can't buy them here.

656
00:52:02,490 --> 00:52:04,990
-You never bought them yourself?
-No, I never.

657
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:07,160
Shut up, you stuck-up cow.

658
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:12,540
But I'll bring you some back, if you like.

659
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,210
You are joking?

660
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:16,880
He's taking you to Paris?

661
00:52:17,750 --> 00:52:19,130
This term?

662
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:24,510
Wait. Isn't it your birthday next Thursday?

663
00:52:25,390 --> 00:52:27,140
Might be.

664
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:29,810
Oh, my God. Your birthday?

665
00:52:29,890 --> 00:52:33,730
I would not like to be you.
All those suppers you've had off of him.

666
00:52:35,270 --> 00:52:37,860
You've such a Victorian attitude
to sex, you two.

667
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:40,820
Your parents wouldn't let you
swan off like that, would they?

668
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:42,610
Well, we haven't told them yet.

669
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:45,110
But David will come up with some story.
He usually does.

670
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:46,740
Yeah, I've noticed that.

671
00:52:46,910 --> 00:52:50,910
Chanel perfume, Chanel perfume.
Chanel lipstick, Chanel lipstick.

672
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,290
Those funny cigarettes
you were smoking, Sobranies.

673
00:52:53,370 --> 00:52:55,040
Ten packets each.

674
00:52:55,710 --> 00:52:58,090
How much is the Chanel perfume?

675
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:03,050
Are you the girl going to Paris,
or are you not, because...

676
00:53:07,970 --> 00:53:09,640
Tina, top button.

677
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:14,770
Jenny, the headmistress
wants a word with you.

678
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:19,820
The legend of Mr. Rochester may have
traveled further than you intended.

679
00:53:20,110 --> 00:53:21,280
Come.

680
00:53:24,070 --> 00:53:25,490
Miss Millar.

681
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:34,040
We're all very excited
about your forthcoming trip to Paris.

682
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:37,120
Our excitement, indeed, knows no bounds.

683
00:53:37,210 --> 00:53:39,750
Some of us can talk of little else.

684
00:53:40,630 --> 00:53:42,800
An older man, I understand?

685
00:53:44,630 --> 00:53:46,970
A word of warning, Miss Millar.

686
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:52,430
There may well have been
the odd sixth form girl

687
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:56,770
who has lost an important part of herself,

688
00:53:56,850 --> 00:53:58,560
perhaps the best part,
while under our supervision.

689
00:53:58,650 --> 00:53:59,940
These things happen, regrettably.

690
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:03,980
If, however, we are made aware of that loss,
then of course the young lady in question

691
00:54:04,070 --> 00:54:05,780
would have to continue
her studies elsewhere.

692
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:08,570
If, that is, she still has any use for A-levels.

693
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:10,530
Do I make myself clear?

694
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:15,330
-Can I go now?
-If you would.

695
00:54:26,090 --> 00:54:28,260
What are you doing in there?

696
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:31,100
Well, I imagine
she's lighting the candles on my cake.

697
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:33,060
You're 17, not 250.

698
00:54:36,890 --> 00:54:40,600
-Thanks for inviting me.
-It was Marjorie's idea, not mine.

699
00:54:42,650 --> 00:54:45,360
-Not even Jenny's, for that matter.
-Dad !

700
00:54:49,110 --> 00:54:51,570
Well, blow them out
before the house burns down.

701
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:54,490
-Make a... Okay, just... Don't wait.
-Bravo.

702
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:01,540
-Who'd like a piece?
-Me, please.

703
00:55:01,630 --> 00:55:03,630
Well, come on. Come on. Presents.

704
00:55:03,710 --> 00:55:05,550
It doesn't matter...

705
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:12,970
It's a new Latin dictionary.

706
00:55:16,430 --> 00:55:18,890
Thank you. I needed a new one.

707
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:23,940
Oh, dear! Snap!

708
00:55:37,410 --> 00:55:40,330
Good grief! Jenny, you should see this!

709
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:42,540
-It's a special day.
-She's a special girl.

710
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:43,960
I know it.

711
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:47,960
Bit of help.

712
00:55:48,050 --> 00:55:50,170
Makes your dictionary
look a bit feeble, eh, Graham?

713
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:52,550
-Gosh !
-And these are for you.

714
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:55,350
-Hello, young man.
-David !

715
00:55:55,430 --> 00:55:58,470
-David, would you like a drink?
-I'd love one.

716
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:03,520
I'd best be going.
I've got a stack of homework to do, so...

717
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:05,190
Oh, well...

718
00:56:05,270 --> 00:56:07,570
-Thank you. Bye.
-Cheers.

719
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:10,360
-Bye, Mr. Millar.
-Cheerio, Graham.

720
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:11,780
Thank you.

721
00:56:12,490 --> 00:56:14,740
Wonderful to see you, Graham.

722
00:56:15,910 --> 00:56:18,290
-Goodbye, Jenny.
-Bye, Graham.

723
00:56:21,210 --> 00:56:23,790
-A little something warming?
-You know me so well.

724
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:25,710
-Can I open anything yet?
-Wait for me.

725
00:56:25,790 --> 00:56:28,130
Before you open that lot, I've got a surprise.

726
00:56:28,210 --> 00:56:30,800
Next weekend,
we're all going to CafГ© de Flore

727
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:33,880
-to celebrate Jenny's birthday.
-Lovely.

728
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:38,260
CafГ© de Flore
is in the Boulevard St. Germain, in Paris.

729
00:56:39,470 --> 00:56:42,680
-What do you mean, Paris?
-You know the one, Dad.

730
00:56:44,060 --> 00:56:45,810
No, no. No, no, no.

731
00:56:46,860 --> 00:56:50,650
No, no, we don't have any French money,
and besides, it's too...

732
00:56:51,570 --> 00:56:54,150
-Well, I don't think it would agree with me.
-Dad.

733
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:57,320
The French don't like us,
Jenny, you know that.

734
00:56:57,410 --> 00:56:58,990
John Sutton, from work,
he went there last year.

735
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:00,490
They were very rude to him.

736
00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:05,000
I don't want to spoil anyone's fun,
but it's just not for me, Europe.

737
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:09,170
-You'll have to go another time.
-You've just said you don't like Europe.

738
00:57:09,250 --> 00:57:11,260
So what's going to change?
It'll have to be Europe, won't it,

739
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:13,260
because it certainly won't be you.

740
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:15,090
-I'll take her.
-To the Continent?

741
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:17,260
-Why not?
-And leave me here on my own?

742
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:19,100
Oh, for God's sake!

743
00:57:28,690 --> 00:57:30,400
What do you think?

744
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:35,240
You know what Jenny's like
about France, Jack.

745
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:37,870
French films and books and music.

746
00:57:37,950 --> 00:57:39,450
-Of course I do.
-Sorry, yes.

747
00:57:39,530 --> 00:57:42,540
It goes without saying, she's your daughter.

748
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:48,960
Jenny likes to joke about how you're
a stick in the mud, and all the rest of it.

749
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:51,460
But I know that's not who you are.

750
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:55,050
Otherwise, she wouldn't be who she is.

751
00:57:56,220 --> 00:57:57,430
No.

752
00:57:57,510 --> 00:58:00,300
But I can also see
that I have acted out of turn,

753
00:58:00,390 --> 00:58:03,020
and I'm sorry.

754
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:18,070
What about your Aunt Helen?

755
00:58:26,290 --> 00:58:29,710
-An hour late.
-We'll make it. I promise.

756
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:34,880
-Okay, there's a flight at 8:00 in the morning.
-Good.

757
00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:48,940
There's no bed.

758
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:51,690
I pushed the boat out and got us a suite.

759
00:58:51,770 --> 00:58:52,980
A suite!

760
00:58:54,190 --> 00:58:57,240
If work stops us
from getting to Paris until tomorrow,

761
00:58:57,320 --> 00:59:00,070
then work can buy us a nice hotel room.

762
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:03,370
Anyway, it's a special occasion, isn't it?

763
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:07,580
I'd have thought tonight of all nights
we'd only need a bed.

764
00:59:24,470 --> 00:59:27,520
Hold on, one second. I've got something.

765
00:59:40,570 --> 00:59:43,910
I thought...
I thought we might practice with this.

766
00:59:45,410 --> 00:59:46,910
With a banana?

767
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:50,580
I thought we might get the messy bit
over with first.

768
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:51,830
What?

769
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:54,330
David !

770
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:58,340
I don't want to lose my virginity
to a piece of fruit!

771
01:00:00,170 --> 01:00:01,510
I'm sorry.

772
01:00:08,770 --> 01:00:10,930
I think the moment might have gone.

773
01:00:11,020 --> 01:00:14,100
-I think we should wait until Paris.
-I'm sorry.

774
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:16,860
Minnie.

775
01:00:19,650 --> 01:00:21,780
I'm an idiot. I'm sorry.

776
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:25,070
David,

777
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:29,450
if tomorrow night does happen,
it's only ever going to happen once.

778
01:00:29,540 --> 01:00:32,290
Why will it only ever happen once?

779
01:00:32,370 --> 01:00:35,210
Because the first time
can only ever happen once.

780
01:00:36,290 --> 01:00:39,420
So no baby talk.

781
01:00:41,010 --> 01:00:42,470
No "Minnie."

782
01:00:48,180 --> 01:00:51,560
Just treat me like a grownup.

783
01:00:53,310 --> 01:00:54,390
Okay?

784
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:04,400
I know. Let's go and sit in our sitting room.

785
01:01:05,570 --> 01:01:06,910
All right.

786
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:10,490
We'll order up some champagne.

787
01:01:21,420 --> 01:01:23,010
Room service?

788
01:02:52,350 --> 01:02:54,890
Do you still feel like a schoolgirl?

789
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:03,940
It wasn't too uncomfortable?

790
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:06,530
Not after the first bit.

791
01:03:08,990 --> 01:03:11,160
It's funny though, isn't it?

792
01:03:14,740 --> 01:03:17,750
All that poetry and all those songs

793
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:21,830
about something that lasts no time at all.

794
01:03:23,210 --> 01:03:24,290
Yeah.

795
01:03:27,170 --> 01:03:30,550
All your exercise books on my desk
in a pile, please.

796
01:03:33,350 --> 01:03:35,220
I bought this for you.

797
01:03:40,270 --> 01:03:42,270
That's very kind of you.

798
01:03:45,820 --> 01:03:47,730
But I can't accept it.

799
01:03:48,780 --> 01:03:50,070
Why not?

800
01:03:51,820 --> 01:03:55,120
It's because of people like you
that I plough through illiterate essays

801
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:57,580
by Sandra Lovell about her pony.

802
01:03:59,080 --> 01:04:02,080
But I know where this came from, Jenny,

803
01:04:02,170 --> 01:04:06,590
and if I took it,
I'd feel I would be betraying both of us.

804
01:04:21,810 --> 01:04:23,020
Jenny?

805
01:04:26,860 --> 01:04:30,610
You can do anything you want,
you know that.

806
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:33,070
You're clever and you're pretty.

807
01:04:36,490 --> 01:04:39,490
Is your boyfriend interested
in clever, Jenny?

808
01:04:41,370 --> 01:04:43,330
I'm not quite sure
what you're trying to tell me.

809
01:04:43,420 --> 01:04:46,540
I'm telling you to go to Oxford,
no matter what.

810
01:04:48,460 --> 01:04:51,510
Because if you don't, you'll break my heart.

811
01:04:58,220 --> 01:05:01,640
-Where did you go?
-Cambridge.

812
01:05:01,730 --> 01:05:04,270
Well, you're clever and you're pretty,

813
01:05:04,350 --> 01:05:08,770
so presumably, clever Miss Stubbs won,
and here you are with your pony essays.

814
01:05:08,860 --> 01:05:10,530
I don't know, these last few months,

815
01:05:10,610 --> 01:05:13,240
I've eaten in wonderful restaurants
and been to jazz clubs

816
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:17,240
and watched wonderful films,
heard beautiful music.

817
01:05:19,620 --> 01:05:20,910
Jenny, are you taking precautions?

818
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:24,080
-It's nothing to do with that.
-Isn't it?

819
01:05:24,170 --> 01:05:28,880
Maybe all our lives are going to end up
with pony essays, or housework.

820
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:30,630
And, yes, maybe we'll go to Oxford,

821
01:05:30,710 --> 01:05:32,340
but if we are all going to die
the moment we graduate,

822
01:05:32,420 --> 01:05:35,180
isn't it what we do before that counts?

823
01:05:40,180 --> 01:05:42,430
I'm sorry you think I'm dead.

824
01:05:44,690 --> 01:05:50,020
-I don't think you're dead, I just don't...
-I think you'd better go to your next class.

825
01:06:02,660 --> 01:06:04,200
Go, go, go, go!

826
01:06:07,210 --> 01:06:08,960
Well done, Jenny.

827
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:11,670
I've never won anything before,
not even at the Women's Institute raffle.

828
01:06:11,750 --> 01:06:13,880
I always bet on the sweetest-looking one,
and he always comes last.

829
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:15,970
-Let's go. Come on.
-Can we do it again? I'm feeling lucky.

830
01:06:16,050 --> 01:06:18,890
Come on, let's go, I don't want to miss him.
Pick up your 10 bob on the way out.

831
01:06:18,970 --> 01:06:20,680
I won 10 shillings!

832
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:23,430
Who is this man, anyway?

833
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:26,060
-Peter Rachman.
-Complete bastard.

834
01:06:26,140 --> 01:06:28,480
Why do we have to see him here?

835
01:06:28,560 --> 01:06:30,730
Because he's not the sort of chap
with an office.

836
01:06:46,910 --> 01:06:49,500
A bottle of your finest champagne, please.

837
01:06:49,580 --> 01:06:51,000
There he is.

838
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:58,260
Come on, Jenny, tell them your good news.
Don't be bashful.

839
01:06:58,340 --> 01:07:00,510
No. Be Sneezy.

840
01:07:00,590 --> 01:07:03,220
Jenny got two A's and a B
in her mock A-levels.

841
01:07:03,310 --> 01:07:05,560
Like everyone else
in this sophisticated establishment.

842
01:07:05,640 --> 01:07:08,640
-The B was in Latin.
-Seriously, congratulations.

843
01:07:08,730 --> 01:07:10,060
Excuse us.

844
01:07:15,610 --> 01:07:19,530
-Don't worry too much.
-About what?

845
01:07:20,450 --> 01:07:23,950
Someone told me that in about 50 years,
no one will speak Latin, probably.

846
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:27,330
Not even Latin people.
So don't worry about your B.

847
01:07:33,460 --> 01:07:35,420
He's even more of a bastard than I thought.

848
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:37,630
You wouldn't want him to marry your sister.

849
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:41,380
You wouldn't want to talk to him in a club,
come to that.

850
01:07:41,470 --> 01:07:45,680
You do know what you're doing, old chap,
with Jenny?

851
01:07:45,770 --> 01:07:47,680
This is the one, Danny.

852
01:07:48,310 --> 01:07:49,680
That's it?

853
01:07:51,190 --> 01:07:53,520
You can see she's different.

854
01:07:53,610 --> 01:07:56,020
I just don't want to see her hurt.

855
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:24,140
Have you bought
any more paintings recently?

856
01:08:24,220 --> 01:08:29,850
Have I? Yes! Picked up a little Piper.
Good one, I think.

857
01:08:29,930 --> 01:08:32,100
I'm still trying to work out
what makes good things good.

858
01:08:32,190 --> 01:08:36,980
-It's hard, isn't it?
-The thing is, Jenny, you know.

859
01:08:37,070 --> 01:08:39,480
Without necessarily being able
to explain why.

860
01:08:39,570 --> 01:08:43,700
See, you have taste.
That's not half the battle.

861
01:08:44,990 --> 01:08:46,830
That's the whole war.

862
01:09:08,350 --> 01:09:10,720
Jenny, we should go. It's late.

863
01:09:10,810 --> 01:09:12,140
-Really?
-Yes.

864
01:09:12,230 --> 01:09:16,980
Alas. One day school will be over forever,
and we can talk about art all night.

865
01:09:17,060 --> 01:09:21,320
-You're all right in a taxi, aren't you?
-Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

866
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:23,110
Let's go. Come on.

867
01:09:24,820 --> 01:09:26,160
Good night.

868
01:09:33,080 --> 01:09:34,410
Wait here.

869
01:09:40,300 --> 01:09:43,670
-David, what are you looking for?
-Just...

870
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:48,430
What are you doing?

871
01:09:50,350 --> 01:09:52,020
Will you marry me?

872
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:55,890
What were you looking for?

873
01:09:55,980 --> 01:09:58,190
I thought I had a ring.

874
01:09:58,270 --> 01:10:01,980
It wouldn't have been the right one,
but it would have done for tonight.

875
01:10:02,070 --> 01:10:03,400
Oh, David.

876
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:06,780
I'm serious.

877
01:10:12,620 --> 01:10:14,290
You're very sweet.

878
01:10:16,620 --> 01:10:18,290
What do you think?

879
01:10:25,300 --> 01:10:27,340
-Take me home.
-All right.

880
01:10:56,160 --> 01:11:00,080
They do need some looking after,
but nothing that will require too much work.

881
01:11:00,170 --> 01:11:02,710
Just leave them in your potting shed
for a couple of weeks

882
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:04,170
and they'll look after themselves.

883
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:05,630
Fine, the potting shed.

884
01:11:05,710 --> 01:11:08,930
Who does he think I am?
Prince Rainier of Monaco?

885
01:11:12,510 --> 01:11:15,850
What if I got married
instead of going to college?

886
01:11:15,930 --> 01:11:17,600
-Married?
-Married.

887
01:11:19,690 --> 01:11:21,980
Well, it would depend on who it was,
of course.

888
01:11:22,060 --> 01:11:25,650
-Would it? That's interesting.
-Well, of course it would.

889
01:11:25,730 --> 01:11:28,240
I wouldn't want you married off
just for the sake of it.

890
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:30,530
-Thanks.
-Has somebody asked you?

891
01:11:30,660 --> 01:11:32,530
-Yes.
-Who?

892
01:11:34,660 --> 01:11:37,750
-David?
-No. A man I just met walking his dog.

893
01:11:38,580 --> 01:11:41,120
-What did you tell him?
-Nothing yet.

894
01:11:42,460 --> 01:11:45,550
Do you have a choice, or is it too late?

895
01:11:45,630 --> 01:11:50,300
Of course she's got a choice!
An interesting one, too, eh?

896
01:11:50,380 --> 01:11:53,640
This is where you're supposed to say,
"But what about Oxford?"

897
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:56,010
Look at it another way.

898
01:11:56,100 --> 01:11:59,180
You wouldn't really need to go now,
would you?

899
01:11:59,270 --> 01:12:03,310
I wouldn't need to go?
Would you like to expand on that?

900
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:05,360
You'd be looked after.

901
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:09,650
All that Latin. All those essays.

902
01:12:09,740 --> 01:12:10,900
What was the point?

903
01:12:10,990 --> 01:12:13,490
Why didn't you just send me
prowling round nightclubs?

904
01:12:13,570 --> 01:12:15,620
It would have been less trouble
and I might have had more fun !

905
01:12:15,700 --> 01:12:19,000
I don't know about nightclubs,
I know about education.

906
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:21,830
Anyway, looks like it might have turned out
for the best.

907
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:23,000
How?

908
01:12:24,170 --> 01:12:28,000
He wouldn't want you if you were thick,
now would he?

909
01:12:28,090 --> 01:12:31,090
"May not an ass know
when the cart draws the horse?

910
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:33,680
"Sings. 'Whoop, Jug ! I love thee..."'

911
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:36,680
When it says "sings,"

912
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:38,850
it means you sing the line.

913
01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:42,890
Never mind. Right. Lear!

914
01:12:42,980 --> 01:12:49,190
"Does any here know me? This is not Lear.
Does Lear walk thus? Speak thus?

915
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:51,070
"Where are his eyes?

916
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:56,910
"Ha! Waking?
Who is it that can tell me who I am?"

917
01:12:56,990 --> 01:12:58,790
Miss! Me. I can.

918
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:02,290
Jenny.

919
01:13:03,540 --> 01:13:04,620
What?

920
01:13:07,460 --> 01:13:08,920
Take it off.

921
01:13:11,170 --> 01:13:15,840
Oh, my God ! Is that what I think it is?
I'm going to be a bridesmaid !

922
01:13:19,180 --> 01:13:20,850
You know the school rule on jewelry.

923
01:13:20,930 --> 01:13:22,640
Half the girls in this room
are wearing jewelry.

924
01:13:22,730 --> 01:13:25,900
Yes, but none of it's going
to ruin their lives.

925
01:13:27,690 --> 01:13:30,610
We have a difference of opinion about that.

926
01:13:33,490 --> 01:13:35,990
How far advanced
are these ridiculous plans?

927
01:13:36,070 --> 01:13:39,240
Have you set a date?
Have you decided on a church?

928
01:13:39,330 --> 01:13:42,830
We won't be getting married in a church.
David's Jewish.

929
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:45,710
Jewish?

930
01:13:47,670 --> 01:13:49,000
He's a Jew?

931
01:13:51,170 --> 01:13:53,880
You are aware, I take it,
that the Jews killed our Lord?

932
01:13:54,010 --> 01:13:57,470
And you're aware, I suppose,
that our Lord was Jewish?

933
01:13:58,510 --> 01:14:00,600
I suppose he told you that.

934
01:14:02,270 --> 01:14:05,230
We're all very sorry
about what happened during the war,

935
01:14:05,310 --> 01:14:10,400
but that's absolutely no excuse for that sort
of malicious and untruthful propaganda.

936
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:16,110
Anyway, I can see you're far more in need
of responsible advice than I realized.

937
01:14:17,110 --> 01:14:20,320
Nobody does anything worth doing
without a degree.

938
01:14:21,240 --> 01:14:25,410
Nobody does anything worth doing
with a degree. No woman, anyway.

939
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:27,330
So what I do isn't worth doing?

940
01:14:27,420 --> 01:14:30,460
Or what Miss Stubbs does,
or Mrs. Wilson, or any of us here?

941
01:14:30,540 --> 01:14:32,250
Because none of us would be here
without a degree.

942
01:14:32,340 --> 01:14:35,510
You do realize that, don't you? And, yes,
of course, studying is hard and boring.

943
01:14:35,590 --> 01:14:37,470
-Boring !
-I'm sorry?

944
01:14:37,550 --> 01:14:41,470
Studying is hard and boring.
Teaching is hard and boring.

945
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:45,220
So what you're telling me is to be bored
and then bored and finally bored again,

946
01:14:45,310 --> 01:14:47,190
but this time for the rest of my life?

947
01:14:47,270 --> 01:14:52,520
This whole stupid country is bored.
There's no life in it, or color, or fun.

948
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:54,820
It's probably just as well
the Russians are going

949
01:14:54,900 --> 01:14:56,490
to drop a nuclear bomb on us any day now.

950
01:14:56,570 --> 01:15:00,660
So my choice is
to do something hard and boring,

951
01:15:00,740 --> 01:15:07,410
or to marry my Jew
and go to Paris and Rome and listen to jazz,

952
01:15:07,540 --> 01:15:11,250
and read, and eat good food
in nice restaurants and have fun.

953
01:15:12,210 --> 01:15:14,340
It's not enough to educate us
anymore, Mrs. Walters.

954
01:15:14,420 --> 01:15:17,340
You've got to tell us why you are doing it.

955
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:23,800
It doesn't have to be teaching, you know.
There's the Civil Service.

956
01:15:28,270 --> 01:15:33,310
I don't wish to be impertinent, Mrs. Walters,
but it is an argument worth rehearsing.

957
01:15:34,860 --> 01:15:39,450
You never know. Someone else might want
to know the point of it all one day.

958
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:32,160
-Where did you find him? Why?
-I can't tell you that. I think he likes you.

959
01:16:32,250 --> 01:16:36,880
Do you like her? "Yes, I do like her."
You do? You don't remember?

960
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:38,960
It's Jenny.
You remember her from last time.

961
01:16:39,050 --> 01:16:41,380
"No, I don't." Yes, you do.

962
01:16:41,470 --> 01:16:44,050
Naughty thing. Pardon? That's revolting !

963
01:16:44,140 --> 01:16:46,260
You stick to your own species.

964
01:16:46,350 --> 01:16:50,180
He wants to kiss you, I think.
Was that naughty?

965
01:16:51,850 --> 01:16:53,350
We're engaged.

966
01:16:54,190 --> 01:16:57,480
-No! Really? Engaged?
-Yeah.

967
01:16:57,570 --> 01:16:59,650
-Show her.
-Yes, look.

968
01:16:59,740 --> 01:17:03,900
-Gosh. That's fantastic news.
-Thank you.

969
01:17:04,990 --> 01:17:06,120
Congratulations.

970
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:09,450
I knew you'd see sense about university.
You'll stay pretty now.

971
01:17:09,540 --> 01:17:10,870
Can I still read?

972
01:17:10,950 --> 01:17:13,250
Of course. But it doesn't have
to be books now, does it?

973
01:17:13,330 --> 01:17:16,630
Magazines will do just as well,
and you learn more from them, anyway.

974
01:17:16,710 --> 01:17:18,090
Helen.

975
01:17:18,170 --> 01:17:21,590
Well you won't be laughing, David,
when she goes all speccy and spotty.

976
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:32,140
Danny didn't seem very pleased
about our engagement.

977
01:17:32,230 --> 01:17:36,060
I noticed that, too.
I thought he might be a bit jealous.

978
01:17:36,150 --> 01:17:37,810
Jealous?

979
01:17:37,900 --> 01:17:40,190
We're going to keep him away from you.

980
01:17:47,320 --> 01:17:50,160
I mean, what is one supposed
to order as a starter, anyway?

981
01:17:50,240 --> 01:17:52,410
And how will I know
what is a starter and what isn't?

982
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:56,830
We've been through this, Dad.
It'll be quite clearly marked on the menu.

983
01:17:57,580 --> 01:17:59,540
Can't the three of you just go on your own
and leave me here?

984
01:17:59,630 --> 01:18:02,590
I'd be perfectly happy with a tin of salmon.

985
01:18:06,300 --> 01:18:07,800
-Hello.
-Hello.

986
01:18:13,100 --> 01:18:15,310
Ready? I think you'll like this place, Jack.

987
01:18:15,390 --> 01:18:17,520
Their wine list is as good
as anything I've seen in London.

988
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:19,440
Yes. Someone told me that.

989
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:22,440
David, probably.
Who else would it have been?

990
01:18:24,490 --> 01:18:26,070
Madame.

991
01:18:26,150 --> 01:18:28,030
I was hoping you'd take us in this.

992
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:30,240
You won't want to drive
in anything else after tonight.

993
01:18:30,330 --> 01:18:32,870
Mind you, it drinks petrol.

994
01:18:32,950 --> 01:18:35,750
I'm afraid we'll have to stop
on the way into town.

995
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:38,960
-I feel like Eamonn Andrews.
-Is that a good thing?

996
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:42,630
Eamonn Andrews is the poshest person
that Jack can imagine being.

997
01:18:57,890 --> 01:19:01,980
-How are you tonight, sir?
-Very well. Might as well fill her up.

998
01:19:03,650 --> 01:19:06,820
I'm going to make a quick call.
I'll be two ticks.

999
01:19:14,040 --> 01:19:17,830
Do you think I should offer
to help pay for the petrol?

1000
01:19:17,910 --> 01:19:20,580
Would he be insulted, do you think?

1001
01:19:20,670 --> 01:19:23,340
I know he said tonight was his treat,

1002
01:19:23,420 --> 01:19:25,170
but does that apply to the petrol,
do you think?

1003
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:27,170
I'm sure it does, Jack.

1004
01:19:34,810 --> 01:19:36,560
-Oh, no.
-Jack!

1005
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:38,350
It just came off.

1006
01:19:47,530 --> 01:19:49,950
-Put it on my bill.
-Thank you, sir.

1007
01:19:50,030 --> 01:19:51,280
Cheers.

1008
01:19:54,700 --> 01:19:56,370
Jenny. Jenny.

1009
01:19:57,790 --> 01:19:59,910
-Take us home.
-What's wrong?

1010
01:20:00,870 --> 01:20:03,170
I'm afraid there's been...
Jenny's had a bit of a shock.

1011
01:20:03,250 --> 01:20:04,250
What's happened?

1012
01:20:04,340 --> 01:20:08,590
It's just another one of David's
little muddles and misunderstandings.

1013
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:12,180
I don't want to hear another word
from anybody. Take us home. Now.

1014
01:20:12,260 --> 01:20:13,430
Right.

1015
01:20:24,690 --> 01:20:28,530
-You can take care of this, can't you, David?
-Go inside, Dad.

1016
01:20:32,950 --> 01:20:36,830
"Mr. and Mrs. David Goldman."
"Mr. and Mrs. David Goldman."

1017
01:20:36,910 --> 01:20:39,500
"Mr. and Mrs. David..." You're married !

1018
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:43,000
Legally, yes, but...

1019
01:20:43,080 --> 01:20:46,340
-When were you going to tell me?
-Soon.

1020
01:20:46,420 --> 01:20:49,420
It's just never seemed like the right time.

1021
01:20:52,550 --> 01:20:54,510
You seemed so happy, and I was happy.

1022
01:20:54,590 --> 01:20:59,520
You were living with your wife all this time,
round the corner.

1023
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:02,850
Byron Avenue. It's no wonder
we kept bumping into each other, is it?

1024
01:21:02,940 --> 01:21:05,600
-What number?
-34.

1025
01:21:11,530 --> 01:21:13,650
Don't be like this. Come on.

1026
01:21:17,450 --> 01:21:21,370
I have nothing. I didn't take my exams.

1027
01:21:22,460 --> 01:21:24,960
I... I left school.

1028
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
Where's it all gone now?

1029
01:21:30,460 --> 01:21:32,260
I can get a divorce.

1030
01:21:35,550 --> 01:21:38,180
Everything will turn out for the best.

1031
01:21:47,190 --> 01:21:48,900
Go and tell them.

1032
01:21:51,940 --> 01:21:55,070
Go and tell them,
and then go and tell your wife.

1033
01:21:55,820 --> 01:21:58,070
They won't listen now.

1034
01:21:58,160 --> 01:22:04,250
All right? I'll come round tomorrow
when everyone's feeling a bit calmer.

1035
01:22:04,330 --> 01:22:09,040
Please don't make me...
Please don't make me tell them on my own.

1036
01:22:09,130 --> 01:22:11,630
You owe me that much.
You owe them that much.

1037
01:22:11,710 --> 01:22:14,010
I owe them much more than that.

1038
01:22:20,640 --> 01:22:21,760
Hey...

1039
01:22:37,320 --> 01:22:40,620
Two minutes,
and then I'll come out and drag you in.

1040
01:23:38,220 --> 01:23:39,840
What's going on?

1041
01:23:43,510 --> 01:23:47,310
He's helping himself to some Dutch courage
before facing you.

1042
01:23:48,180 --> 01:23:51,060
Stolen Dutch courage, from the look of it.

1043
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:55,110
He has something he has to tell you.

1044
01:24:07,080 --> 01:24:08,750
He just drove off.

1045
01:24:15,090 --> 01:24:16,670
Can you tell us?

1046
01:24:19,090 --> 01:24:20,630
Jenny, please?

1047
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:29,060
I wouldn't worry about it too much.

1048
01:24:31,480 --> 01:24:33,980
-When I found out...
-Not now, Helen.

1049
01:24:43,030 --> 01:24:44,820
I tried to tell him.

1050
01:24:46,490 --> 01:24:50,160
I'm not speaking to him now,
if that's any consolation.

1051
01:24:53,080 --> 01:24:55,750
It's a funny world you people live in.

1052
01:24:57,170 --> 01:24:59,340
You both watched me carrying on
with a married man

1053
01:24:59,420 --> 01:25:01,170
and you didn't think it was worth
saying anything about it.

1054
01:25:01,260 --> 01:25:04,260
Yes, well, if you want that conversation...

1055
01:25:04,340 --> 01:25:09,180
You watched David and I help ourselves
to a map, and you didn't say much, either.

1056
01:25:36,710 --> 01:25:38,790
Come on, you, let's go.

1057
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:40,130
Good boy.

1058
01:25:48,100 --> 01:25:49,260
Hello.

1059
01:25:50,810 --> 01:25:54,480
Hello. Sorry, I think I've got
the wrong number. I was looking for my...

1060
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:56,940
I wanted... For my cello lesson.

1061
01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:03,240
Oh, no. Don't tell me.

1062
01:26:04,650 --> 01:26:08,070
Good God. You're a child.

1063
01:26:12,410 --> 01:26:16,000
You didn't know
about any of this, presumably?

1064
01:26:20,090 --> 01:26:21,750
No. They never do.

1065
01:26:26,380 --> 01:26:30,680
You're not in the family way, are you?
Because that's happened before.

1066
01:26:35,690 --> 01:26:37,440
Thank God for that.

1067
01:26:41,400 --> 01:26:43,280
No. No. You stay here.

1068
01:26:55,660 --> 01:26:58,080
-Did you see her?
-Yes, I saw her.

1069
01:26:59,290 --> 01:27:01,380
I didn't talk to her. There wasn't any need.

1070
01:27:01,460 --> 01:27:03,460
We have to have this out.

1071
01:27:05,130 --> 01:27:07,130
Well, if you won't do it, I will.
I'm still your father.

1072
01:27:07,220 --> 01:27:09,380
You're my father again now, are you?

1073
01:27:09,470 --> 01:27:13,640
And what were you when you encouraged
me to throw my life away?

1074
01:27:13,720 --> 01:27:16,350
Silly schoolgirls are always getting seduced
by glamorous older men.

1075
01:27:16,430 --> 01:27:18,350
But what about you two?

1076
01:27:48,130 --> 01:27:49,340
Jenny?

1077
01:27:56,310 --> 01:27:57,520
Jenny.

1078
01:28:02,440 --> 01:28:04,110
Jenny, I'm sorry.

1079
01:28:12,490 --> 01:28:15,120
I know I've made a mess of everything.

1080
01:28:22,750 --> 01:28:25,000
All my life I've been scared,

1081
01:28:26,920 --> 01:28:29,420
and I didn't want you to be scared.

1082
01:28:32,010 --> 01:28:34,720
That's why I wanted you to go to Oxford.

1083
01:28:35,890 --> 01:28:38,140
Then along came David.

1084
01:28:38,980 --> 01:28:43,230
He knew famous writers, he knew
how to get to classical music concerts,

1085
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:50,860
but he wasn't who he said he was.

1086
01:28:53,570 --> 01:28:56,240
He wasn't who you said he was, either.

1087
01:29:05,380 --> 01:29:08,960
The other day your mother and I were
listening to a program on the radio

1088
01:29:09,050 --> 01:29:11,510
about C. S. Lewis, and they said

1089
01:29:11,590 --> 01:29:14,260
that he'd moved to Cambridge in 1954.

1090
01:29:18,430 --> 01:29:21,100
I said, "Well they've got that wrong."

1091
01:29:24,230 --> 01:29:27,110
Our Jenny wouldn't have his name
in her book

1092
01:29:28,860 --> 01:29:30,940
if he'd moved to Cambridge.

1093
01:29:40,660 --> 01:29:43,790
There's a cup of tea
and some biscuits out here.

1094
01:30:16,780 --> 01:30:18,990
How do you think we can help?

1095
01:30:21,490 --> 01:30:25,160
I want to repeat my last year at school
and take my exams.

1096
01:30:26,830 --> 01:30:31,170
I got the impression, last time we spoke,
that you didn't see the point of school,

1097
01:30:31,250 --> 01:30:33,960
or of me, or of any of us here.

1098
01:30:34,050 --> 01:30:36,430
I know. I was stupid.

1099
01:30:36,510 --> 01:30:39,140
The life I want, there's no shortcut.

1100
01:30:41,470 --> 01:30:44,350
I know now that I need to go to university.

1101
01:30:45,690 --> 01:30:48,480
It gives me absolutely
no pleasure whatsoever

1102
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:52,570
to see our young schoolgirls
throwing their lives away.

1103
01:30:52,650 --> 01:30:55,570
Although, of course, you are not
one of our schoolgirls anymore.

1104
01:30:55,650 --> 01:30:57,900
Through your own volition.

1105
01:30:57,990 --> 01:31:00,700
I suppose you think I'm a ruined woman.

1106
01:31:02,870 --> 01:31:04,790
You're not a woman.

1107
01:31:06,460 --> 01:31:09,120
No, I'm afraid I think that the offer
of a place at this school

1108
01:31:09,210 --> 01:31:10,670
would be wasted on you.

1109
01:31:36,860 --> 01:31:38,070
Come in.

1110
01:31:40,570 --> 01:31:42,910
I didn't expect to see you again.

1111
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:52,420
This is lovely.

1112
01:31:53,250 --> 01:31:55,750
All your books and pictures and...

1113
01:31:57,470 --> 01:31:59,880
Paperbacks and postcards, Jenny.

1114
01:32:01,050 --> 01:32:03,260
That's all you need, isn't it?

1115
01:32:06,220 --> 01:32:08,020
Just somewhere to...

1116
01:32:17,320 --> 01:32:21,070
I'm sorry I said those silly things.
I didn't understand.

1117
01:32:25,620 --> 01:32:27,450
Let's forget about it.

1118
01:32:36,090 --> 01:32:37,590
A Burne-Jones.

1119
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:40,220
Do you like him?

1120
01:32:40,300 --> 01:32:42,470
I do. Still.

1121
01:32:44,640 --> 01:32:48,310
Still? You sound very old and wise.

1122
01:32:51,640 --> 01:32:55,480
I feel old, but not very wise.

1123
01:33:00,990 --> 01:33:03,240
Miss Stubbs, I need your help.

1124
01:33:08,830 --> 01:33:12,040
I was so hoping
that's what you were going to say.

1125
01:34:02,340 --> 01:34:04,050
Thank you, Marjorie.

1126
01:34:19,230 --> 01:34:20,900
It's from Oxford.

1127
01:34:56,100 --> 01:34:59,940
"It is my pleasure to inform you
that your application

1128
01:35:00,020 --> 01:35:04,360
"to read English at Oxford
has been accepted.

1129
01:35:04,440 --> 01:35:08,360
"On behalf of the Faculty of Arts,
the staff of the university

1130
01:35:08,450 --> 01:35:10,910
"look forward to welcoming you..."

1131
01:35:29,890 --> 01:35:32,430
So l went to read English books,

1132
01:35:32,510 --> 01:35:37,310
and did my best to avoid the speccy,
spotty fate that Helen had predicted for me.

1133
01:35:37,390 --> 01:35:42,400
I probably looked as wide-eyed,
fresh and artless as any other student.

1134
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:44,820
But I wasn't.

1135
01:35:46,650 --> 01:35:50,240
One of the boys I went out with,
and they really were boys,

1136
01:35:50,320 --> 01:35:53,320
once asked me to go to Paris with him.

1137
01:35:53,410 --> 01:35:58,000
And I told him I'd love to,
I was dying to see Paris.

1138
01:35:59,420 --> 01:36:03,120
As if I'd never been.
