1
00:00:28,917 --> 00:00:31,875
<i>Rock-paper-scissors.</i>

2
00:00:32,625 --> 00:00:35,333
Rock-paper-scissors.
Got you, fucking queer!

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,417
Nico.

4
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:39,333
Luis.

5
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:40,917
Cristian.

6
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:42,542
Diego, over here.

7
00:00:44,083 --> 00:00:45,208
Nahu.

8
00:00:47,042 --> 00:00:48,000
Mati, with us.

9
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:50,416
I don't know... Joaquin.

10
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,042
Manu, come on. Let's go.

11
00:00:59,417 --> 00:01:00,875
Let's go! I want you in there, man.

12
00:01:01,083 --> 00:01:02,583
Come on, come on!

13
00:01:03,351 --> 00:01:04,476
The ball is ours!

14
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:06,875
Look who's on our team.
Kick-off's on us.

15
00:01:28,083 --> 00:01:30,000
What about this red one?

16
00:01:30,375 --> 00:01:32,583
- I like it.
- Here.

17
00:01:34,333 --> 00:01:35,541
- Girls!
- What?

18
00:01:35,625 --> 00:01:38,083
I wanted to die when Gutiérrez
caught Rocío with the letter!

19
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,125
Oh my God! He's the worst!

20
00:01:40,167 --> 00:01:41,334
- It sucked!
- Terrible!

21
00:01:41,417 --> 00:01:43,334
I could never go back
to school after that.

22
00:01:43,875 --> 00:01:45,542
I forgot to tell you!

23
00:01:45,792 --> 00:01:48,375
I'm going to go to law school
in Buenos Aires after graduation.

24
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:51,333
Weren't you going to study to be a teacher
at the Manuel Belgrano?

25
00:01:51,458 --> 00:01:54,833
Yeah, but I thought about it,
and I like law better.

26
00:01:57,542 --> 00:01:59,625
- No, girls. Please, no.
- Yeah, come on!

27
00:01:59,792 --> 00:02:01,584
- Please, stay here.
- No.

28
00:02:02,667 --> 00:02:04,542
Please, don't leave me alone.

29
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,583
- We're going to the the bakery.
- We'll be right back.

30
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:11,083
- We've got cookies.
- I know, but Mora wants a pastry.

31
00:02:11,708 --> 00:02:13,083
You guys keep doing.

32
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,708
They're morons.
They're really stupid.

33
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:37,708
Gra...

34
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:40,083
you have a boyfriend.

35
00:02:40,667 --> 00:02:41,834
Yeah, I know.

36
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:44,666
And we're friends.

37
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:47,625
I don't understand what you mean.

38
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:52,333
Nothing.

39
00:02:52,667 --> 00:02:53,792
Forget it.

40
00:02:56,583 --> 00:02:57,583
Yes.

41
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:02,166
Alright, let's talk soon.
How's that sound?

42
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:04,250
Don't worry about it.

43
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:06,667
Yeah, let's talk. Bye.

44
00:03:13,667 --> 00:03:15,209
- Was that Carlos?
- Yes.

45
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:17,625
Carlos who?

46
00:03:18,292 --> 00:03:20,625
Carlos,
my friend from Buenos Aires.

47
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:24,000
The fat guy! He used to do magic tricks
with coins for you.

48
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:25,958
- Do you remember that?
- No.

49
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:27,749
- He was really little.
- Yeah, he was.

50
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,083
The one that did some time in jail?

51
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:30,500
- Luky...
- What?

52
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:32,000
Don't say that. And?

53
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:34,000
How is it my fault
that he's been in prison?

54
00:03:34,417 --> 00:03:36,875
Loren, do you remember
that he had a son about your age?

55
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:38,250
Remember?

56
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:40,083
There's a chance...

57
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:43,792
that his son
come here to stay with us for a while.

58
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:45,667
- For a visit?
- Yes...

59
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:47,625
For a visit...

60
00:03:47,917 --> 00:03:49,459
No. Not a visit...

61
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:51,667
Until things settle down a bit.

62
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:54,125
Do you have any idea
how long that could take?

63
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:56,833
- What happened?
- I'm not so sure.

64
00:03:56,917 --> 00:03:59,084
He called a couple of times today.

65
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:01,041
They had a problem.

66
00:04:02,167 --> 00:04:05,167
Did he mention anything about
when the accident took place?

67
00:04:05,417 --> 00:04:07,292
Yesterday or this morning.

68
00:04:07,417 --> 00:04:09,750
Accident?
Can you tell us something please?

69
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,166
We don't know much.

70
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:14,833
Just that a friend asked for a favor,
and we're trying to help out.

71
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:18,125
I'd love to help him, really.

72
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:21,250
But this doesn't feel right.

73
00:04:21,542 --> 00:04:23,084
I already told you what I think.

74
00:04:26,542 --> 00:04:28,000
I'll call him and tell him no then.

75
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:06,541
Hey...

76
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:08,625
Hi.

77
00:05:11,542 --> 00:05:13,792
Excuse me. I'm Caíto.

78
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:15,791
Caíto?

79
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:18,541
Carlos's son, your dad's friend.

80
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,500
- What's up? How are you?
- What's up?

81
00:05:24,523 --> 00:05:25,933
Do you want to come in?

82
00:05:27,323 --> 00:05:28,813
Sure. Why not?

83
00:05:33,263 --> 00:05:34,443
Thanks.

84
00:06:01,593 --> 00:06:04,363
- How's your dad doing?
- Not so good.

85
00:06:05,513 --> 00:06:07,113
His wife's son had a...

86
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:09,523
an accident and he's in the hospital.

87
00:06:13,263 --> 00:06:14,913
What happened to him? Is it bad?

88
00:06:16,393 --> 00:06:17,923
I think he's going to die.

89
00:06:21,173 --> 00:06:22,323
I'm sorry.

90
00:06:22,973 --> 00:06:24,203
What happened?

91
00:06:24,973 --> 00:06:26,743
We crashed the motorcycle.

92
00:06:35,983 --> 00:06:39,763
Hello! Caíto, look how big you are!

93
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,343
How are you? So cute!

94
00:06:42,473 --> 00:06:44,623
You're huge. Welcome.

95
00:06:45,713 --> 00:06:48,303
- He looks just like his dad, right?
- Just like him.

96
00:06:48,423 --> 00:06:50,383
- Identical.
- Amazing. When did you get here?

97
00:06:50,483 --> 00:06:51,883
A couple hours ago.

98
00:06:52,903 --> 00:06:55,013
- Good.
- We didn't think you'd...

99
00:06:55,813 --> 00:06:58,063
We weren't expecting you.
It's a real surprise.

100
00:06:58,463 --> 00:07:00,453
This is Lucas's room.

101
00:07:01,273 --> 00:07:03,153
You'll be just fine here.

102
00:07:06,613 --> 00:07:09,013
I guess you'll want
to put your things away.

103
00:07:09,193 --> 00:07:10,503
Maybe in here...

104
00:07:11,323 --> 00:07:13,883
No, this is all full.
Luky, would you empty out a drawer for him?

105
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:19,783
It'd be best if he weren't left alone.

106
00:07:21,133 --> 00:07:22,133
And...

107
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:26,213
that the's not alone in the house.

108
00:07:26,983 --> 00:07:27,983
That you...

109
00:07:28,423 --> 00:07:29,793
That you stay alert.

110
00:07:30,403 --> 00:07:33,863
But be subtle, you know?
We don't want him to feel watched, but...

111
00:07:34,063 --> 00:07:35,933
He shouldn't feel watched...

112
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:38,033
but I should watch him. Is that it?

113
00:07:38,223 --> 00:07:40,153
No. I didn't say you should watch him.

114
00:07:40,663 --> 00:07:41,933
Well, yeah. A little.

115
00:07:42,473 --> 00:07:43,643
The usual.

116
00:08:09,353 --> 00:08:11,023
How do you see yourself working here?

117
00:08:11,973 --> 00:08:12,973
Fine.

118
00:08:14,463 --> 00:08:15,833
Hang on a second.

119
00:08:23,133 --> 00:08:25,073
- How are you doing?
- Good, you?

120
00:08:25,233 --> 00:08:26,603
Good, you know.

121
00:08:27,263 --> 00:08:29,793
Caíto is in the car.
The boy I talked to you about.

122
00:08:32,183 --> 00:08:33,333
Foul, ref!

123
00:08:35,403 --> 00:08:36,403
Come on, kick it.

124
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:42,773
Come on, you play like a little girl.

125
00:08:46,343 --> 00:08:47,703
Pinching is off-limits.

126
00:08:51,663 --> 00:08:53,464
Loren, is that your new cell phone?

127
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:54,593
- Take it.
- Let me see.

128
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:57,413
What did we say about phones at the table?

129
00:08:57,513 --> 00:08:59,273
I was checking out
Loren's new phone.

130
00:08:59,473 --> 00:09:01,343
Did you finally buy it?

131
00:09:01,623 --> 00:09:03,193
- Yeah.
- How nice.

132
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:05,323
It has to be great,
being that expensive.

133
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:07,123
He used his savings to pay for it.

134
00:09:07,453 --> 00:09:08,453
Give me that.

135
00:09:09,143 --> 00:09:10,913
How did it go today?

136
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:15,000
Very good.
We had a meeting with the principal.

137
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:17,173
We left a note for her.

138
00:09:17,453 --> 00:09:20,523
- Use a napkin, honey.
- No. I'm embarrassed, we have guests.

139
00:09:20,753 --> 00:09:24,563
So what? Use a napkin,
or take your shirt off.

140
00:09:24,813 --> 00:09:26,523
What did the note say?

141
00:09:27,123 --> 00:09:30,573
You can't begin to imagine how hard
it was for all of us moms to agree.

142
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:34,875
Some said we should call the mother
and make her take responsibility and pay.

143
00:09:35,042 --> 00:09:36,959
Another mom said that we should request

144
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:40,667
a thorough report
by the school psychologists.

145
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:43,750
Some others wanted
the Department of Education to intercede.

146
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,166
Just imagine the madness...

147
00:09:46,292 --> 00:09:48,834
- "The mommies."
- Exactly.

148
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:51,333
I'm on the PTA at Loren's school.

149
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:54,792
And we're dealing with a serious issue.
One of the kids...

150
00:09:55,263 --> 00:09:57,193
One of the kids messed up really bad.

151
00:09:57,473 --> 00:09:59,083
So? What's the final decision?

152
00:09:59,213 --> 00:10:01,813
We all voted in favor
of expelling him.

153
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:05,723
- That bad?
- It's terrible, poor thing.

154
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:08,233
He's in your class, isn't he?
What's his name?

155
00:10:08,373 --> 00:10:10,573
- Ramiro.
- What's he like?

156
00:10:11,053 --> 00:10:13,293
He gets in trouble a lot,
but he's a nice kid.

157
00:10:13,393 --> 00:10:15,213
He's a nice kid. That's true.

158
00:10:15,403 --> 00:10:18,503
If you ask me, there are less drastic ways
to make him understand.

159
00:10:18,633 --> 00:10:20,383
He needs to be punished in some way.

160
00:10:20,563 --> 00:10:23,653
He messed up really bad,
he damaged school property.

161
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:27,323
"The school property"...
He just broke a window.

162
00:10:27,453 --> 00:10:29,053
That's school property.

163
00:10:29,413 --> 00:10:31,743
Not only that,
he broke into the school at night.

164
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:35,000
Did you know he was carrying
a bottle of alcohol and a box of matches?

165
00:10:35,073 --> 00:10:36,443
Did you know that?

166
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:39,458
The curse of the tomato sauce.

167
00:10:40,263 --> 00:10:42,693
- Told you!
- A ravioli landed on my pants.

168
00:10:42,963 --> 00:10:44,553
You're such a snitch!

169
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:47,433
The curse of the tomato sauce...

170
00:11:03,993 --> 00:11:05,543
Are you going out?

171
00:11:06,293 --> 00:11:08,993
I'm going to take a walk.
Do you want to come?

172
00:11:11,283 --> 00:11:13,393
It's a bit late to go out.

173
00:11:14,873 --> 00:11:16,743
It's just a little walk.
I'll be right back.

174
00:11:19,573 --> 00:11:21,773
Hang on.
I'll change and go with you, okay?

175
00:11:22,233 --> 00:11:23,233
Sure.

176
00:11:54,303 --> 00:11:56,453
We should leave soon, okay?

177
00:11:56,603 --> 00:11:58,083
You can go ahead.

178
00:12:00,953 --> 00:12:01,993
I'll wait for you.

179
00:12:11,843 --> 00:12:13,003
Do it behind your back.

180
00:12:13,703 --> 00:12:15,093
Like this.

181
00:12:16,843 --> 00:12:18,443
- I'll help you.
- Let's see...

182
00:12:27,343 --> 00:12:28,813
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

183
00:12:48,573 --> 00:12:49,853
Let it go, come on.

184
00:12:52,273 --> 00:12:53,663
What's up?

185
00:12:54,923 --> 00:12:55,923
Caíto.

186
00:12:57,013 --> 00:12:58,183
Caíto.

187
00:12:59,643 --> 00:13:01,103
We should go.

188
00:13:01,403 --> 00:13:02,463
We're leaving.

189
00:13:03,292 --> 00:13:05,750
- What are you doing?
- Drop the stick, we have to go.

190
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:07,208
What are you doing?

191
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:09,375
- We have to go, Caíto.
- What are you doing?

192
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:10,833
We're leaving.

193
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:36,803
Get up.

194
00:13:53,443 --> 00:13:54,443
It's alright.

195
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:45,458
BAD: 1/2 PILL
VERY BAD: 1 PILL

196
00:16:45,573 --> 00:16:48,223
DO NOT TAKE
MORE THAN 2 PILLS A DAY!

197
00:16:49,403 --> 00:16:52,903
What we're being told is:
"This is how you have to behave.

198
00:16:53,073 --> 00:16:54,513
This is how...

199
00:16:54,823 --> 00:16:56,543
life should be." Alright?

200
00:16:57,563 --> 00:17:02,413
The classic viewpoint states
that truth is exterior to art,

201
00:17:02,533 --> 00:17:04,913
but that this truth is also innocent.

202
00:17:05,103 --> 00:17:06,273
Lorenzo!

203
00:17:06,493 --> 00:17:07,753
Would you like a bed?

204
00:17:07,993 --> 00:17:10,193
- No, sorry.
- Okay.

205
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:12,203
Then a subject is created...

206
00:17:15,673 --> 00:17:18,303
Lu, go get Caíto.
Lunch is ready.

207
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:21,313
- I already did.
- Well, go again. Come on.

208
00:17:21,993 --> 00:17:23,623
Go.

209
00:17:30,503 --> 00:17:32,616
You two got into
some trouble last night.

210
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:35,377
What were you up to?

211
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:38,416
We went for a walk.

212
00:17:38,863 --> 00:17:39,863
Right...

213
00:17:41,023 --> 00:17:43,673
- What time did you come back?
- Really late.

214
00:17:52,543 --> 00:17:54,363
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

215
00:17:56,383 --> 00:17:57,823
Where did you go?

216
00:17:59,023 --> 00:18:01,893
We just went to a place nearby.

217
00:18:02,093 --> 00:18:03,763
Who gave you permission?

218
00:18:05,473 --> 00:18:07,223
We'll talk about it later, Lolo.

219
00:18:07,513 --> 00:18:09,053
Caíto, let me tell you something:

220
00:18:09,163 --> 00:18:12,633
you're new here,
maybe you don't know the house rules.

221
00:18:12,773 --> 00:18:15,603
Maybe it's different in your house,
but I'd like you to know that

222
00:18:15,683 --> 00:18:18,353
you have to ask for permission
to go out at night here.

223
00:18:18,493 --> 00:18:20,303
Right, mom. It was my bad, sorry.

224
00:18:20,417 --> 00:18:22,417
And it's not really allowed
to go out on a school night

225
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,958
because we have to study
or work the next day. And alcohol, never.

226
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:28,083
Am I clear?

227
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:31,625
- Yeah, mom. He got it.
- I'm talking to Caíto.

228
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:33,375
Is that clear, Caíto?

229
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:35,333
Yes.

230
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,125
Good.

231
00:18:49,223 --> 00:18:51,223
- What's up?
- Hey... Come in.

232
00:18:52,823 --> 00:18:53,823
Thanks.

233
00:19:06,383 --> 00:19:07,813
What´s with all these books?

234
00:19:08,263 --> 00:19:09,543
What about them?

235
00:19:10,643 --> 00:19:13,173
- Are they yours?
- Yeah. You want one?

236
00:19:25,993 --> 00:19:27,583
Look what my mom found.

237
00:19:30,103 --> 00:19:31,593
- Look.
- No way!

238
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:35,313
Check out those curls.

239
00:19:35,603 --> 00:19:37,173
And your bangs.

240
00:19:41,003 --> 00:19:42,473
We looked terrible.

241
00:19:45,403 --> 00:19:47,133
You went all crazy last night.

242
00:19:48,063 --> 00:19:50,463
I'm not telling you off.

243
00:19:51,373 --> 00:19:53,323
It's done, it's over.

244
00:19:53,933 --> 00:19:57,533
I have to admit
you scared the shit out of me.

245
00:19:58,113 --> 00:20:02,053
Since we'll be living together
for a couple of months, I thought...

246
00:20:02,683 --> 00:20:05,227
If you ever feel like talking
about your problems...

247
00:20:05,453 --> 00:20:07,423
- About your brother.
- He's not my brother.

248
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:09,263
Okay, the son of...

249
00:20:10,403 --> 00:20:12,043
Or maybe about other stuff...

250
00:20:12,233 --> 00:20:14,373
You can also talk to my parents.

251
00:20:14,513 --> 00:20:17,203
You may think
they're a bit uptight,

252
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:19,313
but they're actually pretty cool.

253
00:20:21,663 --> 00:20:23,923
Or we could find a therapist.

254
00:20:27,043 --> 00:20:28,133
I'm not crazy.

255
00:20:28,163 --> 00:20:30,623
You don't need to be crazy
to go to therapy.

256
00:20:30,923 --> 00:20:32,833
I think some day I'll go too.

257
00:20:34,763 --> 00:20:36,893
What I'm trying to say is that...

258
00:20:37,993 --> 00:20:40,343
it´s not good
to keep things inside,

259
00:20:41,163 --> 00:20:43,663
it's better to talk about them.

260
00:20:45,623 --> 00:20:47,083
- Alright.
- Okay.

261
00:20:47,813 --> 00:20:48,813
Cool.

262
00:21:08,753 --> 00:21:10,153
Need some help?

263
00:21:10,323 --> 00:21:12,073
No, it's fine. I've got it.

264
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:52,573
Watching your dad play
was quite something.

265
00:21:57,173 --> 00:21:59,303
You know, we were pretty...

266
00:21:59,723 --> 00:22:01,103
close.

267
00:22:02,073 --> 00:22:03,863
Buddies, pals.

268
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:07,693
Our life stories...

269
00:22:08,313 --> 00:22:10,243
were pretty similar.

270
00:22:17,293 --> 00:22:18,963
He was amazing, Carlitos!

271
00:22:19,933 --> 00:22:21,713
He made it to Division One.

272
00:22:27,133 --> 00:22:29,623
We had kids at the same time, you know?

273
00:22:29,763 --> 00:22:32,233
You were born...
You're one year older than Lorenzo.

274
00:22:35,593 --> 00:22:37,853
We were so young.

275
00:22:38,403 --> 00:22:41,953
We had no idea
what we were doing.

276
00:22:43,563 --> 00:22:46,263
We went from
thinking about girls, partying...

277
00:22:46,413 --> 00:22:48,143
to changing diapers.

278
00:22:50,433 --> 00:22:52,543
To earning a buck to buy milk.

279
00:22:57,703 --> 00:22:59,903
And then... you know what happened.

280
00:23:07,153 --> 00:23:08,653
Come with me.

281
00:23:20,433 --> 00:23:21,903
You want one?

282
00:23:56,683 --> 00:23:57,683
Thanks.

283
00:26:30,453 --> 00:26:32,233
Something to drink?

284
00:26:33,193 --> 00:26:34,193
No, thanks.

285
00:26:35,753 --> 00:26:36,753
Are you sure?

286
00:26:37,453 --> 00:26:38,763
I'm fine.

287
00:26:41,875 --> 00:26:42,875
So...

288
00:26:43,083 --> 00:26:44,166
Were you busy or anything?

289
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:47,375
No, I was going to call the girls,
see what they were up to.

290
00:26:47,625 --> 00:26:48,792
Should I call them?

291
00:26:49,083 --> 00:26:50,333
Sure, no problem.

292
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,208
What time will your parents be back?

293
00:26:57,375 --> 00:26:59,125
They won't be back till tonight.

294
00:27:01,693 --> 00:27:03,163
You want to sit here?

295
00:28:37,523 --> 00:28:39,043
Let's talk later.

296
00:28:39,513 --> 00:28:40,773
Sounds good.

297
00:28:43,573 --> 00:28:45,253
- Well, bye.
- Bye.

298
00:30:16,063 --> 00:30:17,063
What's up?

299
00:30:17,283 --> 00:30:19,423
<i>Hey, just wanted to see how you were.</i>

300
00:30:21,323 --> 00:30:22,653
We just saw each other.

301
00:30:23,843 --> 00:30:26,453
<i>Yeah, I know.
I kind of miss you.</i>

302
00:30:28,633 --> 00:30:29,633
You're nuts.

303
00:30:29,983 --> 00:30:32,713
<i>Also, I have something to tell you.</i>

304
00:30:34,613 --> 00:30:36,693
<i>I think I'm going to dump Matías.</i>

305
00:30:44,553 --> 00:30:46,373
Did you text him again?
Did you call?

306
00:30:46,493 --> 00:30:49,993
Yeah, I called him a bunch of times.
He's out of range.

307
00:30:50,103 --> 00:30:51,913
Maybe his bike broke down.

308
00:30:52,493 --> 00:30:54,353
Or he had an accident.

309
00:30:55,743 --> 00:30:56,743
I don't know.

310
00:30:57,223 --> 00:30:59,123
- With a truck.
- Lucas!

311
00:30:59,543 --> 00:31:01,073
That crashed right into him.

312
00:31:01,823 --> 00:31:03,753
Ran its four wheels over his head.

313
00:31:04,013 --> 00:31:07,083
- Stop!
- The ground is all flooded with blood.

314
00:31:07,313 --> 00:31:09,003
- Red.
- Lucas!

315
00:31:09,633 --> 00:31:11,293
- What?
- Stop it!

316
00:31:11,733 --> 00:31:14,363
Did you guys give him any money?

317
00:31:14,863 --> 00:31:15,863
No.

318
00:31:16,234 --> 00:31:18,704
Not even to buy a soda
if he's thirsty?

319
00:31:18,813 --> 00:31:23,170
If he wants something,
he asks for it and we buy it.

320
00:31:23,503 --> 00:31:24,543
I don't get it.

321
00:31:24,643 --> 00:31:27,963
I thought that was better.
He got really wasted the first night.

322
00:31:28,033 --> 00:31:31,213
- You never got drunk?
- What? I'm not Caíto!

323
00:31:31,313 --> 00:31:32,643
I don't know him that well.

324
00:31:32,743 --> 00:31:35,323
Was it a one-time thing?
Maybe it was, maybe it wasn't.

325
00:31:35,403 --> 00:31:36,593
Trust us.

326
00:32:02,333 --> 00:32:03,333
Nothing.

327
00:32:06,423 --> 00:32:10,273
I called the cops. They say
we have to wait 24 hours to file a report.

328
00:32:12,413 --> 00:32:13,813
What about the hospital?

329
00:32:14,263 --> 00:32:16,113
I called. Nothing.

330
00:32:22,693 --> 00:32:24,893
Does he have cell phone credit?

331
00:32:25,543 --> 00:32:26,663
I don't know.

332
00:32:28,563 --> 00:32:31,343
Let's go to the road post.
Maybe the cops saw him pass by.

333
00:32:31,623 --> 00:32:33,503
- Let's go.
- Okay, I'll come with.

334
00:32:33,613 --> 00:32:35,433
No. It's super late, honey.

335
00:32:35,553 --> 00:32:38,093
Go to bed.
You have school tomorrow, alright?

336
00:32:40,123 --> 00:32:41,293
Go to bed.

337
00:32:42,303 --> 00:32:43,883
Lolo, would you stay?

338
00:32:44,553 --> 00:32:47,373
Let me know if he turns up.
Call us.

339
00:32:47,833 --> 00:32:48,833
Yes.

340
00:33:08,503 --> 00:33:09,503
Hey.

341
00:33:11,663 --> 00:33:13,733
- What's up?
- Where were you?

342
00:33:15,503 --> 00:33:17,303
Around, biking.

343
00:33:18,313 --> 00:33:19,983
It's two in the morning.

344
00:33:21,883 --> 00:33:24,423
I went along the road,
all the way up...

345
00:33:24,643 --> 00:33:26,273
Down, up, I don't know...

346
00:33:26,453 --> 00:33:29,813
The area is nice
but I have no idea where I ended up.

347
00:33:36,203 --> 00:33:37,663
They're looking for you.

348
00:33:41,153 --> 00:33:42,523
Did they go to the cops?

349
00:33:42,783 --> 00:33:45,113
The cops, the hospital...

350
00:34:00,743 --> 00:34:02,273
They worry too much.

351
00:34:05,383 --> 00:34:09,333
I mean, they spend the whole day
worrying about what I do or don't do.

352
00:34:11,953 --> 00:34:13,423
I'm not used to that.

353
00:34:14,563 --> 00:34:17,163
I bet your dad would worry too.

354
00:34:18,743 --> 00:34:19,743
Wouldn't he?

355
00:34:22,493 --> 00:34:23,743
Caíto!

356
00:34:23,953 --> 00:34:25,403
Caíto, you're okay.

357
00:34:26,573 --> 00:34:30,043
Oh my God, we were so worried!

358
00:34:31,123 --> 00:34:32,763
What happened to you?
Where were you?

359
00:34:35,793 --> 00:34:36,863
Biking around.

360
00:34:39,053 --> 00:34:40,643
Biking around?

361
00:34:40,933 --> 00:34:43,643
- At this time of the night?
- I didn't realize.

362
00:34:47,783 --> 00:34:50,653
You didn't realize?
It was dark and you didn't realize?

363
00:34:52,053 --> 00:34:53,993
He made it to the fire hydrant.

364
00:34:54,443 --> 00:34:57,313
He must have taken a wrong turn.
He ended up in Perales.

365
00:34:57,593 --> 00:34:58,623
He got lost.

366
00:35:01,633 --> 00:35:03,013
Is that true?

367
00:35:06,883 --> 00:35:07,983
Yes.

368
00:35:10,033 --> 00:35:12,633
I'm glad you found the way
back home then.

369
00:35:29,093 --> 00:35:30,233
Are you asleep?

370
00:35:32,483 --> 00:35:33,483
What's wrong?

371
00:35:34,563 --> 00:35:35,563
Nothing.

372
00:35:35,953 --> 00:35:37,013
I couldn't sleep.

373
00:35:44,283 --> 00:35:45,553
Do you believe in God?

374
00:35:49,483 --> 00:35:50,483
Yes.

375
00:35:53,323 --> 00:35:54,323
I do,

376
00:35:54,853 --> 00:35:57,563
but I'm not sure
in same way that other people do.

377
00:35:58,753 --> 00:35:59,753
Well,

378
00:36:00,193 --> 00:36:01,513
Me neither.

379
00:36:02,303 --> 00:36:03,303
Why?

380
00:36:04,503 --> 00:36:06,243
I feel there is a god,

381
00:36:07,073 --> 00:36:09,273
but I don't trust religion.

382
00:36:11,583 --> 00:36:12,583
Right.

383
00:36:15,993 --> 00:36:18,653
Do you know anything about
the son of my dad's wife?

384
00:36:20,053 --> 00:36:21,593
Just what you told me.

385
00:36:23,553 --> 00:36:25,023
He had an accident.

386
00:36:27,663 --> 00:36:28,663
Right...

387
00:36:29,433 --> 00:36:31,503
Well, it was actually a fight.

388
00:36:32,453 --> 00:36:33,713
With who?

389
00:36:34,383 --> 00:36:35,643
Me.

390
00:36:37,843 --> 00:36:38,983
Why?

391
00:36:39,743 --> 00:36:41,793
He wanted me out of the house.

392
00:36:42,763 --> 00:36:44,673
Why would they want that?

393
00:36:45,563 --> 00:36:47,433
Because I skipped rent.

394
00:36:47,963 --> 00:36:50,233
Did you steal the rent money?

395
00:36:51,623 --> 00:36:52,623
No.

396
00:36:54,223 --> 00:36:55,583
You know Graciela?

397
00:36:56,593 --> 00:36:59,193
My dad's wife.
She hates my guts.

398
00:36:59,923 --> 00:37:01,193
She always has.

399
00:37:02,203 --> 00:37:04,853
She kept complaining
that I didn't study or work.

400
00:37:05,503 --> 00:37:08,473
One day, she said
that if I wanted to live in the house,

401
00:37:08,633 --> 00:37:10,243
I had to start bringing money in.

402
00:37:11,123 --> 00:37:12,823
That I had to start paying rent

403
00:37:13,043 --> 00:37:16,023
for the room I shared
with her son.

404
00:37:17,293 --> 00:37:18,793
He's a year younger than me,

405
00:37:19,033 --> 00:37:21,623
but he's 6.2 feet tall
and does kickboxing.

406
00:37:22,443 --> 00:37:23,973
He beat the shit out of me.

407
00:37:25,783 --> 00:37:28,363
So I grabbed an iron rod
from the backyard...

408
00:37:28,863 --> 00:37:30,303
and smashed his head with it.

409
00:37:30,443 --> 00:37:31,473
Are you kidding me?

410
00:37:31,563 --> 00:37:35,113
He should be happy
I didn't shoot his brains out with my gun.

411
00:37:35,743 --> 00:37:37,153
I controlled myself.

412
00:37:43,193 --> 00:37:45,603
You told me it's not good
to keep things inside.

413
00:37:46,983 --> 00:37:49,313
I'm telling this for the first time.

414
00:37:50,453 --> 00:37:51,763
It's okay,

415
00:37:52,113 --> 00:37:53,863
you just caught me off guard.

416
00:37:56,958 --> 00:37:59,083
My dad's wife reported me.

417
00:38:01,083 --> 00:38:02,500
That's one of the reasons I'm here.

418
00:38:04,542 --> 00:38:07,875
Don't worry,
I won't tell a soul.

419
00:38:09,625 --> 00:38:10,625
I know.

420
00:38:11,792 --> 00:38:13,167
Thanks.

421
00:38:42,873 --> 00:38:44,203
Is everything alright?

422
00:38:45,893 --> 00:38:47,293
No. Not really.

423
00:38:49,543 --> 00:38:51,993
Last night was a big deal.

424
00:38:52,343 --> 00:38:53,503
A really big deal.

425
00:38:54,433 --> 00:38:55,433
He got lost.

426
00:38:55,753 --> 00:38:57,623
Okay, let's say he got lost.

427
00:38:58,093 --> 00:39:01,173
Let's say he got lost,

428
00:39:01,263 --> 00:39:03,583
- but we had a terrible time.
- Yes.

429
00:39:05,123 --> 00:39:08,963
It's terrible. He's out on his bike now
and I'm so worried.

430
00:39:09,343 --> 00:39:11,483
What Mom is trying to say...

431
00:39:11,613 --> 00:39:15,433
is that Caíto is not a bad kid
or a bad person.

432
00:39:15,583 --> 00:39:16,583
- Right?
- Right.

433
00:39:16,763 --> 00:39:20,563
But we can't take responsibility for him,
we can't be responsible.

434
00:39:21,953 --> 00:39:23,143
I...

435
00:39:23,443 --> 00:39:25,649
I'm having a hard time
sleeping with Caíto.

436
00:39:26,303 --> 00:39:27,703
He's awake all the time.

437
00:39:28,613 --> 00:39:30,223
Well, but...

438
00:39:30,373 --> 00:39:31,963
We can't send him back home.

439
00:39:32,958 --> 00:39:33,958
Lolo...

440
00:39:35,583 --> 00:39:37,375
Really? What are we going to do?
Tell me.

441
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:40,541
Are you going to take care of him?
Can you be responsible?

442
00:39:55,593 --> 00:39:58,213
You can sleep here, and...

443
00:39:59,958 --> 00:40:01,750
I'll make it fit.

444
00:40:04,643 --> 00:40:06,763
During the day, we can put it in here,

445
00:40:06,863 --> 00:40:08,783
so it doesn't block the way, okay?

446
00:40:09,093 --> 00:40:10,093
Alright.

447
00:40:11,723 --> 00:40:13,903
Do you want to
leave your bag in the closet?

448
00:41:15,893 --> 00:41:17,283
Wake up, asshole.

449
00:41:17,723 --> 00:41:18,833
You have to wake up.

450
00:41:22,543 --> 00:41:24,873
- Come on, man! Take it!
- I don't know, man!

451
00:41:37,113 --> 00:41:38,253
Come on, get up!

452
00:41:39,723 --> 00:41:41,723
You have to go to work, come on.

453
00:41:45,023 --> 00:41:46,173
Come on, get up.

454
00:41:46,792 --> 00:41:49,709
I'm going to beat the shit out of you, man.
Cut it out, come on.

455
00:41:55,863 --> 00:41:58,153
No, it's late. We have to go.

456
00:41:58,693 --> 00:42:00,443
Here, open your mouth.

457
00:42:02,043 --> 00:42:03,043
Come on.

458
00:42:25,375 --> 00:42:26,625
It's freezing.

459
00:42:47,673 --> 00:42:48,833
Is that your mom?

460
00:42:49,113 --> 00:42:50,113
Yeah.

461
00:42:50,933 --> 00:42:52,813
You never mentioned her.

462
00:42:53,273 --> 00:42:54,313
Is she alive?

463
00:42:54,733 --> 00:42:55,823
Sort of.

464
00:42:57,633 --> 00:42:58,633
What do you mean?

465
00:43:00,813 --> 00:43:02,813
She sleeps all the time.

466
00:43:03,333 --> 00:43:05,433
She's on pills for depression.

467
00:43:05,633 --> 00:43:08,823
She lives with my grandparents.
She can't live alone.

468
00:43:14,313 --> 00:43:15,943
Come on, let's get in.

469
00:43:16,333 --> 00:43:18,733
It's dangerous.

470
00:43:18,983 --> 00:43:20,523
What could happen?

471
00:43:20,593 --> 00:43:22,853
It gets very deep,
and there are strong currents down there.

472
00:43:23,293 --> 00:43:25,743
Three tourists have died
from hypothermia right here.

473
00:43:29,113 --> 00:43:30,173
What is hypothermia?

474
00:43:30,272 --> 00:43:34,392
When your body temperature
suddenly drops.

475
00:43:35,518 --> 00:43:37,867
You pass out and drown
in less than a minute.

476
00:43:47,946 --> 00:43:49,352
I'm still going in.

477
00:43:49,539 --> 00:43:51,203
You can stay here if you want.

478
00:43:51,448 --> 00:43:54,233
Caíto, can I ask you a favor?

479
00:43:55,625 --> 00:43:56,500
No!

480
00:43:56,750 --> 00:43:58,000
Caíto!

481
00:43:58,733 --> 00:44:00,433
Can I ask you for one little favor?

482
00:44:00,623 --> 00:44:02,353
No, that's not a favor.

483
00:44:05,928 --> 00:44:07,226
You're right.

484
00:44:07,393 --> 00:44:09,187
It's none of my business.

485
00:44:09,643 --> 00:44:10,933
Bye.

486
00:44:11,493 --> 00:44:12,785
Bye.

487
00:44:33,243 --> 00:44:34,243
Wait up!

488
00:44:44,783 --> 00:44:46,733
- What's up?
- Hey, Andrés. What's up?

489
00:44:46,773 --> 00:44:47,913
Mario, how's it going?

490
00:44:48,023 --> 00:44:49,793
- Come on in, let's talk.
- Sure.

491
00:44:50,243 --> 00:44:52,043
- How is everything going?
- Good.

492
00:44:56,503 --> 00:44:57,683
Perfect.

493
00:44:57,993 --> 00:44:59,123
Do you want to count it?

494
00:44:59,713 --> 00:45:00,713
No, it's fine.

495
00:45:00,953 --> 00:45:02,323
Here's a whole month.

496
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:04,353
And here's the fee.

497
00:45:04,663 --> 00:45:07,913
This is for you, to keep track
of what you spend.

498
00:45:08,113 --> 00:45:09,833
So, this is October...

499
00:45:13,723 --> 00:45:14,723
Here...

500
00:45:18,633 --> 00:45:19,973
Are you happy?

501
00:45:22,733 --> 00:45:25,203
Caíto, that money is yours.

502
00:45:26,323 --> 00:45:27,323
It's for you.

503
00:45:27,633 --> 00:45:29,303
You earn it with work.

504
00:45:30,613 --> 00:45:33,013
You should be proud of yourself.

505
00:45:33,453 --> 00:45:35,953
When your dad finds out about
how much you've saved,

506
00:45:36,263 --> 00:45:37,933
he'll be proud too.

507
00:45:41,283 --> 00:45:43,133
He's going to want to borrow some...

508
00:45:44,513 --> 00:45:46,693
- to buy dope.
- What are you saying?

509
00:45:47,663 --> 00:45:49,973
That was before. It's different now.

510
00:45:50,793 --> 00:45:51,793
No.

511
00:45:53,673 --> 00:45:57,453
Don't buy that whole rehab image
he keeps trying to sell people.

512
00:45:58,463 --> 00:46:00,323
He's no saint.

513
00:46:16,813 --> 00:46:18,553
What songs do you know?

514
00:46:20,093 --> 00:46:23,243
None. But I can try and play one.

515
00:46:26,143 --> 00:46:27,643
What do you mean, none?

516
00:46:27,713 --> 00:46:30,963
I play classical guitar,
I only read sheet music.

517
00:46:32,523 --> 00:46:33,793
You're such a character.

518
00:46:35,053 --> 00:46:38,463
What's the point of learning to play guitar
if you don't know any songs?

519
00:46:38,602 --> 00:46:41,132
Classic guitar is the best way
to study music,

520
00:46:41,375 --> 00:46:43,625
and after that you can play
any song you want.

521
00:46:44,113 --> 00:46:45,283
But you don't know any.

522
00:47:19,203 --> 00:47:20,653
Have you read all of these?

523
00:47:21,853 --> 00:47:23,983
You're obsessed with them.

524
00:47:25,483 --> 00:47:26,913
You're such a nerd.

525
00:47:37,623 --> 00:47:39,003
Can I tell you a secret?

526
00:47:40,423 --> 00:47:41,503
Sure.

527
00:47:42,483 --> 00:47:44,773
Promise you'll keep it between us.

528
00:47:50,513 --> 00:47:51,513
What happened?

529
00:47:54,473 --> 00:47:55,873
It's my birthday today.

530
00:47:57,183 --> 00:47:59,693
You scared me! Happy birthday!

531
00:48:00,733 --> 00:48:02,003
Keep it down.

532
00:48:02,167 --> 00:48:04,834
Why didn't you tell me?
Let's celebrate!

533
00:48:06,073 --> 00:48:07,813
- No, wait.
- Yeah, let's celebrate.

534
00:48:08,013 --> 00:48:09,413
Don't tell anybody.

535
00:48:09,563 --> 00:48:10,563
Why not?

536
00:48:10,943 --> 00:48:12,353
Because it will make me feel...

537
00:48:12,673 --> 00:48:15,730
uncomfortable.
Besides, it's not that big a deal.

538
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:21,653
Just know it's party time.

539
00:48:23,913 --> 00:48:25,423
I don't have any nice clothes...

540
00:48:26,093 --> 00:48:27,693
Don't worry about it.

541
00:48:28,503 --> 00:48:29,773
Pick out a shirt.

542
00:48:34,167 --> 00:48:35,584
Come on, pick one!

543
00:48:47,993 --> 00:48:49,523
Happy birthday, dude.

544
00:49:10,663 --> 00:49:11,663
Hey...

545
00:49:13,683 --> 00:49:14,683
Thanks.

546
00:49:16,593 --> 00:49:17,593
You're welcome.

547
00:49:18,763 --> 00:49:19,763
I mean it.

548
00:49:45,103 --> 00:49:46,103
Wait.

549
00:49:46,323 --> 00:49:47,323
Let's make a deal.

550
00:49:48,603 --> 00:49:51,163
A deal? You already said yes.

551
00:49:51,693 --> 00:49:53,313
I know, but listen...

552
00:49:54,153 --> 00:49:56,023
If you guys come back tonight,

553
00:49:56,253 --> 00:49:59,013
I'll let you go
to grandma and grandpa's this summer

554
00:49:59,163 --> 00:50:01,030
for a whole month.

555
00:50:02,917 --> 00:50:05,209
No. Let it go, mom.

556
00:50:05,613 --> 00:50:06,613
Let it go.

557
00:50:06,783 --> 00:50:09,413
Don't worry, it'll be fine.
It's just one night.

558
00:50:09,667 --> 00:50:13,792
It'll be fine. And if it's not,
they'll call us and we'll go get them.

559
00:50:14,123 --> 00:50:16,163
- Don't worry.
- No. I do worry.

560
00:50:16,293 --> 00:50:18,563
That's the point, I worry.

561
00:51:12,203 --> 00:51:13,203
Hey...

562
00:51:14,403 --> 00:51:16,437
Let's stay one more day?

563
00:51:18,423 --> 00:51:21,693
I have to go to school
and you have to work.

564
00:51:24,653 --> 00:51:26,604
Besides, we don't have that much food.

565
00:51:27,063 --> 00:51:28,743
Who cares about food?

566
00:51:31,293 --> 00:51:32,303
Besides, look...

567
00:51:33,933 --> 00:51:35,043
Look what I've got.

568
00:51:36,623 --> 00:51:38,023
You know what it is, right?

569
00:51:38,443 --> 00:51:40,483
Of course I do. I'm not an idiot.

570
00:51:41,993 --> 00:51:42,993
But...

571
00:51:43,623 --> 00:51:44,963
Have you ever smoked?

572
00:51:46,073 --> 00:51:47,073
No.

573
00:51:47,253 --> 00:51:48,483
But I'm not into it.

574
00:51:50,523 --> 00:51:52,873
Cool. More for me then.

575
00:52:02,733 --> 00:52:05,523
Remember what you told me,

576
00:52:05,923 --> 00:52:08,373
about going to therapy some day?

577
00:52:08,573 --> 00:52:09,573
Yeah.

578
00:52:10,373 --> 00:52:11,373
What about it?

579
00:52:13,673 --> 00:52:15,483
What for? I mean...

580
00:52:16,243 --> 00:52:17,583
What's your problem?

581
00:52:18,773 --> 00:52:21,643
I don't think
I have one particular problem.

582
00:52:22,823 --> 00:52:25,943
But I guess there are some things
that could improve.

583
00:52:28,473 --> 00:52:29,473
Like what?

584
00:52:32,413 --> 00:52:33,413
I'm not sure...

585
00:52:34,823 --> 00:52:37,023
if it's something that specific.

586
00:52:38,373 --> 00:52:39,373
But...

587
00:52:40,643 --> 00:52:42,973
Some things are just not that clear to me.

588
00:52:47,083 --> 00:52:48,513
Name one.

589
00:52:50,083 --> 00:52:51,083
Let's see...

590
00:52:55,043 --> 00:52:56,043
Sometimes...

591
00:52:56,433 --> 00:52:59,363
even though I have people around me...

592
00:53:02,113 --> 00:53:03,813
I feel kind of lonely.

593
00:53:12,163 --> 00:53:13,533
Pussy.

594
00:53:15,823 --> 00:53:17,543
You're such an asshole.

595
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:20,743
I'm sorry.

596
00:53:21,903 --> 00:53:24,283
I thought you were going to say
something more serious.

597
00:53:54,893 --> 00:53:56,243
You're unbelievable!

598
00:53:56,553 --> 00:53:57,553
What?

599
00:53:58,833 --> 00:54:00,223
You're unbelievable!

600
00:54:00,693 --> 00:54:01,693
It's alright.

601
00:54:02,193 --> 00:54:04,123
I'm just freezing my balls off,
that's all.

602
00:54:04,973 --> 00:54:06,193
Do you know how to swim?

603
00:54:06,323 --> 00:54:08,153
- What?
- Do you know how to swim?

604
00:54:08,453 --> 00:54:09,453
No.

605
00:54:12,393 --> 00:54:13,393
Come on, get out.

606
00:54:15,513 --> 00:54:16,513
What's wrong?

607
00:54:18,453 --> 00:54:19,953
I got a cramp, it's gone now.

608
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:21,573
Get out!

609
00:54:24,683 --> 00:54:25,683
What's wrong?

610
00:54:41,493 --> 00:54:42,943
Motherfucking asshole!

611
00:55:05,063 --> 00:55:06,063
Caíto!

612
00:55:08,853 --> 00:55:09,853
Caíto.

613
00:55:19,203 --> 00:55:20,203
Caíto!

614
00:55:24,853 --> 00:55:25,863
Caíto!

615
00:55:30,823 --> 00:55:32,533
You scared me, asshole!

616
00:55:32,733 --> 00:55:33,903
Stop! What the hell?

617
00:55:34,133 --> 00:55:36,786
- What's wrong with you, moron?
- It was a prank.

618
00:55:37,543 --> 00:55:38,743
It was a prank!

619
00:55:39,043 --> 00:55:40,353
You're an asshole!

620
00:55:41,163 --> 00:55:42,413
Are you mad?

621
00:55:51,417 --> 00:55:53,000
Come on, it was a prank.

622
00:56:02,893 --> 00:56:05,483
Who gets into the water
with all their clothes on?

623
00:56:10,323 --> 00:56:11,993
I was holding my breath.

624
00:56:15,753 --> 00:56:16,973
Let's start a fire...

625
00:56:17,333 --> 00:56:18,373
to warm ourselves.

626
00:56:18,453 --> 00:56:20,343
It's not allowed to start a fire here.

627
00:56:22,203 --> 00:56:24,643
It's good
to break the rules once in a while.

628
00:56:41,483 --> 00:56:42,613
We're going home.

629
00:56:45,223 --> 00:56:46,433
Calm down.

630
00:56:47,833 --> 00:56:49,483
Get your things. We're leaving.

631
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:51,073
Why?

632
00:56:51,643 --> 00:56:54,583
Can't you see I'm freezing?
I want to take a shower.

633
00:56:55,773 --> 00:56:56,803
Fine.

634
00:56:56,923 --> 00:56:58,613
You can go ahead. I'm staying.

635
00:56:58,713 --> 00:57:00,723
The tent is mine and I'm taking it.

636
00:57:01,683 --> 00:57:03,733
"The tent is mine." You pussy!

637
00:57:13,783 --> 00:57:14,783
What are you doing?

638
00:57:16,623 --> 00:57:17,623
Give it back!

639
00:57:18,013 --> 00:57:19,193
Come on, give it back!

640
00:57:20,153 --> 00:57:21,913
If we stay, I'll give it back.

641
00:57:32,073 --> 00:57:33,073
Let's stay.

642
00:57:38,333 --> 00:57:39,333
No!

643
00:57:41,713 --> 00:57:43,563
What the hell
is wrong with you, asshole?

644
00:57:48,183 --> 00:57:50,323
It's not mine, it's from the library!

645
00:58:05,553 --> 00:58:06,863
You're an asshole!

646
00:58:38,753 --> 00:58:40,403
How much did your cell phone cost?

647
00:58:40,643 --> 00:58:41,983
I'll buy you a new one.

648
00:58:47,783 --> 00:58:48,943
You don't have to.

649
00:58:57,113 --> 00:58:59,073
I have a lot of money saved.

650
00:59:07,833 --> 00:59:09,443
You're strong, motherfucker.

651
00:59:11,523 --> 00:59:12,523
I'm sorry.

652
00:59:14,133 --> 00:59:15,603
It's alright.

653
00:59:17,143 --> 00:59:18,483
You had a fit.

654
00:59:20,483 --> 00:59:21,693
It happens.

655
00:59:23,583 --> 00:59:26,333
But acting on impulses is wrong.

656
00:59:29,667 --> 00:59:33,125
Smashing someone's head
with an iron rod is wrong.

657
00:59:38,793 --> 00:59:39,793
I'm sorry.

658
00:59:41,113 --> 00:59:42,113
It's fine.

659
00:59:45,883 --> 00:59:47,693
I wasn't trying to make excuses.

660
00:59:51,143 --> 00:59:53,403
I wasn't accusing you either.

661
00:59:55,733 --> 00:59:56,733
Not yet...

662
01:00:05,043 --> 01:00:06,813
Let me see. Give it to me.

663
01:00:16,243 --> 01:00:17,243
Hi, dad.

664
01:00:17,993 --> 01:00:19,773
Yeah, we're having a great time.

665
01:00:21,543 --> 01:00:23,373
Actually, we were thinking...

666
01:00:23,633 --> 01:00:25,433
about staying here one more night.

667
01:00:43,803 --> 01:00:44,973
Come on, man!

668
01:00:45,173 --> 01:00:46,783
One more time.

669
01:00:53,613 --> 01:00:55,553
You could remove the tip.

670
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:58,283
It's all wet with drool.

671
01:00:59,543 --> 01:01:01,573
- Wait.
- It will drag better now.

672
01:01:03,273 --> 01:01:04,273
Hey...

673
01:01:05,813 --> 01:01:07,193
It hasn't kicked in.

674
01:01:14,163 --> 01:01:15,483
Listen to this!

675
01:01:20,823 --> 01:01:22,893
What's wrong with you, pothead?
Come here.

676
01:01:37,083 --> 01:01:38,343
It's chilly.

677
01:02:21,853 --> 01:02:22,853
Hey...

678
01:02:24,143 --> 01:02:25,373
Close your eyes.

679
01:02:38,853 --> 01:02:40,113
Come on, close them.

680
01:03:12,353 --> 01:03:13,553
I love you, man.

681
01:03:13,813 --> 01:03:15,133
Me too.

682
01:03:31,353 --> 01:03:32,943
Where'd you get that t-shirt?

683
01:03:33,793 --> 01:03:34,793
It's Caíto's.

684
01:03:36,493 --> 01:03:38,953
He has only three, poor Caíto,
and you use them.

685
01:03:39,813 --> 01:03:42,603
What's the problem? He uses mine too.

686
01:04:01,683 --> 01:04:03,563
- Who's he talking to?
- His dad.

687
01:04:03,983 --> 01:04:04,983
Bye.

688
01:04:11,750 --> 01:04:13,333
- Is everything okay, Caíto?
- Yes.

689
01:04:13,875 --> 01:04:15,000
Good.

690
01:04:18,208 --> 01:04:19,791
It's stuffed squash.

691
01:04:20,292 --> 01:04:21,500
Home made, I made them.

692
01:04:23,833 --> 01:04:26,333
I remember how hard it was
to make Lucas eat veggies.

693
01:04:26,458 --> 01:04:27,666
Remember, Luky?

694
01:04:27,792 --> 01:04:29,792
It was huge battle, poor thing.

695
01:04:30,083 --> 01:04:32,583
That reminds me
of this one time when I was six,

696
01:04:32,708 --> 01:04:35,625
and you left me all alone until midnight,

697
01:04:35,833 --> 01:04:39,000
sitting and eating a slice of chard pie.

698
01:04:39,208 --> 01:04:40,333
And it was cold too.

699
01:04:40,667 --> 01:04:41,708
So?

700
01:04:42,417 --> 01:04:45,917
So, I ate a few bites
and we negociated.

701
01:04:47,417 --> 01:04:49,417
But you like vegetables now.

702
01:05:24,483 --> 01:05:25,483
Are you okay?

703
01:05:25,863 --> 01:05:26,903
Yes.

704
01:05:27,083 --> 01:05:28,413
I'm okay.

705
01:05:33,458 --> 01:05:34,958
Wait, let me help you.

706
01:05:59,283 --> 01:06:01,053
Do you want us to call a doctor?

707
01:06:02,223 --> 01:06:03,223
No!

708
01:06:04,203 --> 01:06:05,533
I'll be fine.

709
01:06:16,563 --> 01:06:17,983
Those pills...

710
01:06:18,253 --> 01:06:19,713
you have in your bag.

711
01:06:20,763 --> 01:06:22,303
Do you want to take one?

712
01:06:30,143 --> 01:06:32,203
- I'll go get water.
- No, no.

713
01:06:33,643 --> 01:06:34,913
No water.

714
01:06:43,153 --> 01:06:44,153
It's fine.

715
01:06:53,853 --> 01:06:55,903
From putting it under the sun. It's not...

716
01:06:56,013 --> 01:06:58,490
- If it's not breathing, I'm dead.
- Yeah.

717
01:06:58,843 --> 01:07:01,023
- That's it.
- Good morning.

718
01:07:01,273 --> 01:07:03,589
- Good morning.
- How are you doing, sweetie?

719
01:07:03,973 --> 01:07:05,843
What a face... Where's Caíto?

720
01:07:06,673 --> 01:07:08,413
He's not feeling very well.

721
01:07:09,573 --> 01:07:11,593
I think he should skip work today.

722
01:07:11,683 --> 01:07:14,073
We should let him rest a bit, I guess.

723
01:07:15,413 --> 01:07:16,783
Because he's...

724
01:07:18,083 --> 01:07:19,983
What do you mean skip work?

725
01:07:20,243 --> 01:07:22,093
He's not feeling good.

726
01:07:22,313 --> 01:07:23,313
I'll go see.

727
01:07:23,983 --> 01:07:28,127
- No, but he's really not feeling good.
- Don't worry, I'll go check on him.

728
01:07:31,683 --> 01:07:32,873
Caíto.

729
01:07:35,363 --> 01:07:36,913
Caíto, wake up.

730
01:07:37,621 --> 01:07:39,051
You have to go to work, come on.

731
01:07:39,353 --> 01:07:40,353
Let's go.

732
01:07:41,903 --> 01:07:42,903
Caíto!

733
01:07:45,703 --> 01:07:46,703
Is he drunk?

734
01:07:46,983 --> 01:07:48,403
He took some kind of pill.

735
01:07:48,763 --> 01:07:51,153
Some kind of pill? What kind of pill?

736
01:08:02,273 --> 01:08:03,273
What is this?

737
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:07,083
Lorenzo, why didn't you say anything?

738
01:08:07,333 --> 01:08:08,416
He was going really crazy.

739
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:10,667
Why didn't you wake me, us?

740
01:08:10,833 --> 01:08:12,416
What's wrong with you, son?

741
01:08:12,542 --> 01:08:13,792
Should we go to the hospital?

742
01:08:13,875 --> 01:08:16,458
No. He's going to be fine.
He's fine.

743
01:08:16,833 --> 01:08:19,375
How would you know he's going to be fine?
Do you know what this is?

744
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:23,083
Did you know that if you take two of these
you can die?

745
01:08:24,333 --> 01:08:25,458
He only took one.

746
01:08:25,625 --> 01:08:27,083
- I swear.
- What's going on?

747
01:08:27,250 --> 01:08:28,750
- It's nothing, honey.
- Nothing.

748
01:08:28,917 --> 01:08:31,209
It's time to go to school.
Are you all set?

749
01:08:31,333 --> 01:08:32,625
Let's go.

750
01:08:34,042 --> 01:08:36,250
- Is your bag all set?
- Yeah.

751
01:08:36,917 --> 01:08:37,917
Jacket?

752
01:08:39,333 --> 01:08:41,000
Scarf? It's chilly out.

753
01:08:45,875 --> 01:08:47,875
I think I'm going to stay home.

754
01:08:48,333 --> 01:08:49,333
What?

755
01:08:50,958 --> 01:08:52,750
I'd rather skip school today.

756
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:55,292
You'd rather skip school?

757
01:08:55,750 --> 01:08:58,250
Honey, let's go, please.
I'm having a bad day already.

758
01:08:58,303 --> 01:08:59,303
Yeah, come on. Let's go.

759
01:09:01,133 --> 01:09:04,163
- Lorenzo, get in the car, please! Now!
- I'm getting my bag!

760
01:09:10,653 --> 01:09:11,653
One minute.

761
01:09:13,573 --> 01:09:14,833
- Ready?
- Ready.

762
01:09:15,223 --> 01:09:16,223
Here.

763
01:09:17,313 --> 01:09:18,913
It's cold out. Put it on.

764
01:09:19,503 --> 01:09:21,993
No, I'd better stay.

765
01:09:22,463 --> 01:09:24,193
Alright, I really have to go.

766
01:09:33,193 --> 01:09:34,193
Hello.

767
01:09:35,003 --> 01:09:36,243
This is Lorenzo,

768
01:09:36,463 --> 01:09:37,663
Andrés's son.

769
01:09:38,063 --> 01:09:39,633
I was calling to let you know that...

770
01:09:39,833 --> 01:09:43,183
Caíto is not feeling very well.
He won't be coming in today.

771
01:09:44,883 --> 01:09:46,743
Yes, I'm sorry. Bye.

772
01:09:59,483 --> 01:10:00,733
Where did these come from?

773
01:10:02,133 --> 01:10:04,353
He's had them in his bag
since he got here.

774
01:10:05,533 --> 01:10:08,023
But I'd never seen him take one
until last night.

775
01:10:10,933 --> 01:10:12,233
What's this?

776
01:10:12,983 --> 01:10:15,223
- This was not prescribed by a doctor.
- No.

777
01:10:15,793 --> 01:10:17,793
I bet his dad gave it to him.

778
01:10:19,853 --> 01:10:21,393
How could you hide this from me?

779
01:10:21,593 --> 01:10:24,523
I didn't want you
to get mad at him.

780
01:10:26,792 --> 01:10:28,459
Am I a witch? Is that how you see me?

781
01:10:28,753 --> 01:10:30,083
No, mom.

782
01:10:30,273 --> 01:10:32,073
I didn't say you were a witch.

783
01:10:35,813 --> 01:10:37,093
You just assume.

784
01:10:46,893 --> 01:10:48,963
I know he means well.

785
01:10:49,193 --> 01:10:50,553
I really care about him, Lolo.

786
01:10:50,653 --> 01:10:52,253
You don't care about him.

787
01:10:52,633 --> 01:10:55,143
I do care about him.
Why would you talk to me like that?

788
01:10:55,513 --> 01:10:58,093
You try really hard to like him.

789
01:10:59,033 --> 01:11:00,763
You're nice to him.

790
01:11:04,553 --> 01:11:06,293
But he's Carlos's son.

791
01:11:07,433 --> 01:11:08,433
So?

792
01:11:08,683 --> 01:11:10,583
And you'll never accept that.

793
01:11:10,833 --> 01:11:12,163
Lolo...

794
01:11:39,673 --> 01:11:41,773
Do you know why
we came here in the first place?

795
01:11:42,123 --> 01:11:45,583
Yes.
To get dad away from his friends,

796
01:11:45,903 --> 01:11:47,503
and drugs.

797
01:11:47,993 --> 01:11:49,593
I'm glad that you know.

798
01:11:50,208 --> 01:11:51,458
You know it perfectly well.

799
01:11:51,792 --> 01:11:54,000
Did you also know
that I left my life there?

800
01:11:54,208 --> 01:11:56,041
I left my parents, my friends...

801
01:11:56,123 --> 01:11:59,103
I left everything
to came here and start from scratch.

802
01:11:59,973 --> 01:12:03,373
To this fucking cold, this wind...

803
01:12:03,833 --> 01:12:06,916
that won't stop blowing,
with two kids, a husband...

804
01:12:10,953 --> 01:12:12,273
I'm asking you one thing:

805
01:12:12,383 --> 01:12:15,703
next time you feel like judging me,
please try and be understanding.

806
01:12:15,803 --> 01:12:18,352
At least try with love, please.

807
01:12:21,223 --> 01:12:24,323
- I'm not judging you.
- Yes, you are.

808
01:12:24,433 --> 01:12:27,833
No.
I'm just trying to make you understand...

809
01:12:29,393 --> 01:12:31,455
that Caíto is not Carlos.

810
01:12:43,083 --> 01:12:44,393
Are you...

811
01:12:49,750 --> 01:12:51,792
Are you feeling...

812
01:12:52,583 --> 01:12:54,458
something special for him?

813
01:12:57,125 --> 01:12:59,167
Something special?

814
01:13:00,208 --> 01:13:02,208
- It's okay, Lolo.
- Mom...

815
01:13:03,458 --> 01:13:06,000
Please,
I don't want to talk about this now.

816
01:13:06,167 --> 01:13:07,667
You can tell me.

817
01:13:09,193 --> 01:13:12,063
Dad and I talked about it.
It's fine. It's...

818
01:13:12,243 --> 01:13:13,243
It's okay.

819
01:13:13,542 --> 01:13:14,917
- Mom...
- There's nothing wrong.

820
01:13:14,983 --> 01:13:16,613
Can I please ask you not to?

821
01:13:17,403 --> 01:13:19,113
You've never had a girlfriend, Lolo.

822
01:13:19,263 --> 01:13:21,062
- I don't want to talk about this.
- Trust me.

823
01:13:21,063 --> 01:13:23,362
- You don't trust me anymore?
- Listen to me when I talk.

824
01:13:23,363 --> 01:13:24,393
I'm listening.

825
01:13:24,903 --> 01:13:27,233
I don't want to talk about his now.

826
01:13:29,853 --> 01:13:31,453
Are you in love with Caíto?

827
01:13:31,903 --> 01:13:32,903
Mom!

828
01:13:33,083 --> 01:13:35,843
Can I please ask you?
I don't want to talk about this!

829
01:13:37,223 --> 01:13:38,633
There's nothing wrong with it.

830
01:13:38,963 --> 01:13:40,203
What are we talking about?

831
01:13:40,433 --> 01:13:42,213
You can trust me.

832
01:13:47,733 --> 01:13:49,642
I'm not in love.

833
01:13:50,683 --> 01:13:52,073
I just feel bad for him.

834
01:13:57,923 --> 01:13:59,143
That's it.

835
01:14:04,843 --> 01:14:05,843
Alright.

836
01:14:11,153 --> 01:14:14,213
If you're not going to school,
at least make lunch.

837
01:14:18,593 --> 01:14:20,393
If he wakes up, let me know.

838
01:14:25,633 --> 01:14:26,633
Wait.

839
01:14:27,743 --> 01:14:28,743
What?

840
01:14:50,563 --> 01:14:51,843
I love you.

841
01:14:54,693 --> 01:14:55,893
Me too.

842
01:14:56,373 --> 01:14:57,603
I'm sorry.

843
01:15:47,683 --> 01:15:48,823
You scared me.

844
01:15:50,423 --> 01:15:51,823
What are you looking for?

845
01:15:53,743 --> 01:15:55,703
I was just looking for some aspirin.

846
01:15:57,423 --> 01:15:58,823
There's no aspirin in there.

847
01:16:01,123 --> 01:16:02,833
But once I saw your mom...

848
01:16:03,163 --> 01:16:04,163
No.

849
01:16:08,203 --> 01:16:10,223
That's not the medicine cabinet.

850
01:16:17,003 --> 01:16:18,797
Maybe it was just that one time.

851
01:16:19,723 --> 01:16:20,723
No, Caíto.

852
01:16:33,723 --> 01:16:34,843
I saw her, dude.

853
01:16:36,063 --> 01:16:37,323
I'm not lying.

854
01:17:00,683 --> 01:17:02,203
What are you doing?

855
01:17:02,753 --> 01:17:03,753
Wait.

856
01:17:05,523 --> 01:17:06,593
Can we talk?

857
01:17:06,963 --> 01:17:08,593
What do you want to talk about?

858
01:17:09,313 --> 01:17:11,093
We can settle this ourselves.

859
01:17:13,643 --> 01:17:14,653
No.

860
01:17:21,913 --> 01:17:23,083
Give it to me!

861
01:17:24,003 --> 01:17:25,293
I will. Just wait.

862
01:17:25,383 --> 01:17:26,383
Give it to me!

863
01:17:26,384 --> 01:17:28,243
It's my phone!
You want to take it too?

864
01:17:28,283 --> 01:17:29,613
Who the fuck do you think you are?

865
01:17:29,783 --> 01:17:30,783
Stop!

866
01:17:30,983 --> 01:17:32,863
- I'll give it back.
- Give me my phone!

867
01:17:32,923 --> 01:17:34,012
Give me my phone!

868
01:17:34,013 --> 01:17:35,673
Wait, dude! I'll give it back.

869
01:17:35,903 --> 01:17:38,033
You're making a big deal
out of nothing.

870
01:18:31,983 --> 01:18:33,183
You want money?

871
01:18:33,357 --> 01:18:34,988
Here.

872
01:20:27,063 --> 01:20:28,273
Look.

873
01:20:30,073 --> 01:20:31,673
This is your dad's handwriting.

874
01:20:32,143 --> 01:20:33,603
It's all written down here.

875
01:20:34,843 --> 01:20:36,053
The month,

876
01:20:36,643 --> 01:20:37,843
and the amount...

877
01:20:38,403 --> 01:20:39,653
that goes to me.

878
01:20:39,933 --> 01:20:41,093
All here.

879
01:20:41,393 --> 01:20:42,763
Do the math.

880
01:20:44,373 --> 01:20:47,133
I wasn't trying to take
what's not mine!

881
01:20:47,383 --> 01:20:48,513
Couldn't you ask for it?

882
01:20:49,023 --> 01:20:50,793
They were going to ask me what is was for.

883
01:20:51,053 --> 01:20:52,053
So?

884
01:20:57,713 --> 01:20:59,582
They wouldn't haven given it to me.

885
01:21:00,103 --> 01:21:01,313
It's done now.

886
01:21:01,513 --> 01:21:02,813
You have money now.

887
01:21:03,313 --> 01:21:05,618
You don't need to explain yourself.

888
01:21:06,033 --> 01:21:07,373
It's not that simple.

889
01:21:11,193 --> 01:21:12,755
Some things have happened.

890
01:21:13,003 --> 01:21:14,253
I have to go.

891
01:21:16,153 --> 01:21:17,413
I can't stay.

892
01:21:18,583 --> 01:21:19,823
What happened?

893
01:21:22,813 --> 01:21:24,043
He died, right?

894
01:21:26,073 --> 01:21:27,333
He died.

895
01:21:31,903 --> 01:21:34,632
You're not making things right by leaving.

896
01:21:35,623 --> 01:21:37,242
My dad knows lawyers.

897
01:21:37,783 --> 01:21:39,124
They could help you.

898
01:21:39,643 --> 01:21:41,353
You were both in the fight, right?

899
01:21:41,713 --> 01:21:43,193
He kicked your ass too.

900
01:21:45,675 --> 01:21:47,805
You could explain yourself.

901
01:21:53,093 --> 01:21:54,505
Hang on a sec.

902
01:22:00,413 --> 01:22:01,413
Hi, mom.

903
01:22:02,913 --> 01:22:03,913
Yes.

904
01:22:05,883 --> 01:22:08,195
I was looking for something,
but I found it.

905
01:22:08,483 --> 01:22:09,483
See you.

906
01:22:11,993 --> 01:22:13,856
My mom is on her way.

907
01:22:15,653 --> 01:22:17,396
What do you want to do?

908
01:22:22,473 --> 01:22:24,673
I don't want to be an asshole to you guys.

909
01:22:25,923 --> 01:22:27,810
You've all been so nice to me.

910
01:22:30,393 --> 01:22:32,393
My parents will understand.

911
01:22:33,333 --> 01:22:35,000
I already have.

912
01:22:37,833 --> 01:22:39,625
What do you want to do?

913
01:22:49,783 --> 01:22:51,323
Come on, dude.

914
01:22:53,163 --> 01:22:54,643
Stay.

915
01:22:55,263 --> 01:22:56,883
Please.

916
01:23:00,875 --> 01:23:03,083
We'll figure it out.

917
01:23:05,375 --> 01:23:09,000
We could clean the place up fast
before my mom gets home.
