1
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:15,416
Shall I tell you a secret, Severine?

2
00:02:17,542 --> 00:02:19,499
I love you more every day.

3
00:02:19,667 --> 00:02:21,249
So do I, Pierre.

4
00:02:21,417 --> 00:02:23,333
You're everything to me,

5
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,708
but...
- But what?

6
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:28,958
I, too, wish
it could be perfect.

7
00:02:30,042 --> 00:02:33,083
- If only you were less cold.
- Oh, please, Pierre!

8
00:02:34,167 --> 00:02:35,999
I didn't mean to annoy you...

9
00:02:36,584 --> 00:02:38,666
You know how fond I am of you.

10
00:02:38,834 --> 00:02:41,041
What good is it to me?

11
00:02:43,042 --> 00:02:45,499
How unkind you can be sometimes!

12
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:48,124
I'm sorry.

13
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:56,499
Stop!

14
00:03:06,042 --> 00:03:07,249
Get out!

15
00:03:07,417 --> 00:03:08,833
Why?

16
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,333
Get out, I said!

17
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,833
Why?

18
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,249
- Come on.
- Leave me alone!

19
00:03:19,334 --> 00:03:21,624
Do as I said.

20
00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:32,208
How dare you?

21
00:03:32,667 --> 00:03:33,958
Let go of me!

22
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,374
You brutes!

23
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:42,916
It's not my fault.

24
00:03:43,084 --> 00:03:45,083
I'll explain!

25
00:03:46,834 --> 00:03:49,958
Don't be afraid to hurt
this little tart.

26
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:52,833
- Hurry up!
- Pierre, it's your fault too.

27
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,041
I can explain everything.

28
00:03:55,209 --> 00:03:58,458
Shut your mouth, Madame...
or I'll shut it for you.

29
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,791
Stop it!

30
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:11,124
Tell them to let me go!

31
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,499
Help!

32
00:04:19,084 --> 00:04:20,624
Shut up, slut!

33
00:04:23,292 --> 00:04:24,458
Come on!

34
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:31,374
Pull her up!

35
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:38,083
If you scream, I'll kill you.

36
00:04:38,917 --> 00:04:40,958
Pierre, please...

37
00:04:41,209 --> 00:04:42,999
I'm sorry.

38
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,291
Deeply sorry.

39
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:02,624
I beg of you,
don't let the cats loose!

40
00:05:19,459 --> 00:05:20,874
That's enough.

41
00:05:21,417 --> 00:05:23,999
- She's all yours.
- I love you, Pierre.

42
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:37,208
Severine,
what are you thinking about?

43
00:05:40,542 --> 00:05:42,208
Tell me...

44
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,166
About you...

45
00:05:46,334 --> 00:05:47,874
about us.

46
00:05:48,167 --> 00:05:49,833
We were driving in a coach.

47
00:05:51,042 --> 00:05:52,916
That coach again?

48
00:06:00,334 --> 00:06:02,249
I want to kiss you.

49
00:06:07,792 --> 00:06:09,333
You have to get up early.

50
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,333
- Why?
- To pack our bags.

51
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,541
Where are we going?

52
00:06:13,834 --> 00:06:16,249
It's a surprise for our anniversary.

53
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:19,333
We've been happily married
for a year now.

54
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,541
- May the sun always shine on us!
- What about the hospital?

55
00:06:22,709 --> 00:06:24,999
I want to forget it
for a few days...

56
00:06:25,167 --> 00:06:26,874
and think only of you.

57
00:06:33,334 --> 00:06:35,124
- Happy?
- Yes...

58
00:06:35,292 --> 00:06:39,374
especially when you're here.
I want you with me every minute.

59
00:06:54,709 --> 00:06:56,458
No, please!

60
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,583
Sleep well!

61
00:07:17,834 --> 00:07:19,666
Forgive me...

62
00:07:20,042 --> 00:07:22,458
You're so kind, so understanding.

63
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:24,833
- But I...
- It's nothing.

64
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:26,916
Go to sleep.

65
00:07:37,584 --> 00:07:39,666
Are you coming to the party?

66
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:42,208
I don't know.
Husson turns in early.

67
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:46,041
Let him sleep and come with us.
They said it'll snow later.

68
00:07:46,209 --> 00:07:48,124
I'd rather see the mesmerizer.

69
00:07:48,292 --> 00:07:50,874
- He does wonders.
- I wouldn't be put to sleep.

70
00:07:51,042 --> 00:07:54,666
Mesmerizers are not hypnotists.
They cause sunrises.

71
00:07:54,834 --> 00:07:58,166
A hypnotist plunges you
into darkness.

72
00:07:58,334 --> 00:08:00,583
Well, I'm off. See you later.

73
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:14,499
What time is it?

74
00:08:15,084 --> 00:08:17,958
Five o'clock.
If you're bored, you can go.

75
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:19,916
One is never bored in a bar.

76
00:08:20,084 --> 00:08:23,249
Not like in a church...
where you're alone with your soul.

77
00:08:24,667 --> 00:08:27,041
I'll tell you something pleasant.

78
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:29,624
I love you.

79
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,374
Your scars heal wonderfully!

80
00:08:33,542 --> 00:08:34,958
You bore me!

81
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:46,208
- Let's not go. She's with Husson.
- Too late. He's seen us.

82
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:49,083
What have you got against him?
He's interesting.

83
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,708
Think so? I don't like his looks.

84
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:53,249
Come on.

85
00:09:10,042 --> 00:09:11,499
I saw you passing,

86
00:09:11,667 --> 00:09:13,499


arm in arm.

87
00:09:13,667 --> 00:09:15,583
Just like newly-weds.

88
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,124
Ridiculous, perhaps?

89
00:09:17,292 --> 00:09:20,708
Not at all. Reassuring
in an everyday sort of way.

90
00:09:21,667 --> 00:09:25,791
And yet, Pierre,
you sometimes make me feel guilty.

91
00:09:26,334 --> 00:09:28,249
We are so different.

92
00:09:28,417 --> 00:09:31,041
Men like you are rare.

93
00:09:32,292 --> 00:09:33,999
Sincerely.

94
00:09:35,209 --> 00:09:37,374
Oh... Thank you.

95
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:49,416
What punishments I am missing!

96
00:09:49,667 --> 00:09:51,791
Why? Do you know them?

97
00:09:52,459 --> 00:09:53,916
Is that all you care for?

98
00:09:54,084 --> 00:09:56,666
All the rest's a waste of time.

99
00:09:56,834 --> 00:09:59,749
Maybe you should see a psychiatrist.

100
00:10:00,209 --> 00:10:03,624
Rich and idle,
his two main diseases.

101
00:10:04,167 --> 00:10:05,499
And hunting...

102
00:10:05,667 --> 00:10:09,083
Also, I'm particularly fond
of the working class.

103
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:12,791
I think of them when it snows,
with no furs, no hope, no nothing.

104
00:10:13,084 --> 00:10:14,708
You're very attractive, Severine.

105
00:10:14,917 --> 00:10:17,166
Your compliments are too subtle.
Be quiet.

106
00:10:17,334 --> 00:10:18,791
lmpossible!

107
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,333
I'm leaving you now.
Got a headache.

108
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,583
- Is it cold out?
- No.

109
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,291
I'll get some fresh air.
See you later, Renée.

110
00:10:27,459 --> 00:10:29,541
- See you later.
- Enjoy your walk.

111
00:10:34,084 --> 00:10:36,374
I like him. He's amusing.

112
00:10:36,709 --> 00:10:38,166
He's strange.

113
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:40,166
Worse than that...

114
00:11:01,542 --> 00:11:04,041
- I forgot to ask about Husson.
- He's well.

115
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:07,083
- You still see him?
- Yes, unfortunately.

116
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,166
Remember Henriette?

117
00:11:09,334 --> 00:11:10,749
Yes.

118
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:12,874
They say...

119
00:11:14,042 --> 00:11:16,166
They say she works in a brothel...

120
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:21,041
They say it's absolutely definite.
Several times a week.

121
00:11:22,209 --> 00:11:24,249
Henriette of all people!

122
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:27,208
You're so innocent.

123
00:11:28,792 --> 00:11:30,291
lmagine.

124
00:11:30,459 --> 00:11:32,249
A woman like us.

125
00:11:33,084 --> 00:11:35,249
Going with anybody!

126
00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:37,999
In those places,
one has no choice.

127
00:11:38,292 --> 00:11:40,791
Young and old, ugly and handsome...

128
00:11:41,542 --> 00:11:43,333
Even with someone you love...

129
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,291
it's not always pleasant.

130
00:11:45,459 --> 00:11:49,333
With strangers it must be horrible.
Do those places still exist?

131
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:52,208
Excuse me, ladies...

132
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:55,874
They exist, I can promise you that.

133
00:11:57,334 --> 00:11:59,624
But not like the pre-war days.

134
00:11:59,792 --> 00:12:02,458
No more red lights.

135
00:12:02,917 --> 00:12:06,166
Believe me, plenty of customers.

136
00:12:06,542 --> 00:12:08,416
I could show you half a dozen.

137
00:12:08,917 --> 00:12:10,958
It's part of myjob.

138
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:14,833
Been driving a cab for 20 years
and I've seen all sorts.

139
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:18,999
I was even beaten up twice.
It didn't do me any harm.

140
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:24,499
What's the matter with you?

141
00:12:24,792 --> 00:12:26,416
We're nearly there.

142
00:13:01,042 --> 00:13:03,249
These flowers came for you, Madame.

143
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:06,874
- Who sent them?
- M. Husson.

144
00:13:15,667 --> 00:13:17,583
Why did you put them here?

145
00:13:27,667 --> 00:13:29,416
I'll go and get a cloth.

146
00:13:29,959 --> 00:13:32,583
It won't make a mark.
It was fresh water.

147
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:03,458
What's the matter with me today?

148
00:14:04,167 --> 00:14:05,499
Come here, Severine!

149
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:13,874
Severine, are you coming or not?

150
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:26,666
Have you much more to do?

151
00:14:26,834 --> 00:14:28,708
Nearly finished.

152
00:14:41,542 --> 00:14:43,791
May I ask a silly question?

153
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:45,874
Go right ahead.

154
00:14:49,334 --> 00:14:51,083
Before you met me...

155
00:14:51,292 --> 00:14:54,166
did you often go to...
"houses"?

156
00:14:55,042 --> 00:14:56,624
"Houses"?

157
00:14:58,667 --> 00:15:01,999
Not often. Why?
Are you interested?

158
00:15:02,292 --> 00:15:04,541
Everything about you interests me.

159
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:08,166
I thought they'd been closed.

160
00:15:08,417 --> 00:15:10,458
They're undercover now.

161
00:15:11,542 --> 00:15:13,624
I can't imagine what it's like.

162
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:15,458
Listen, I've got work to do.

163
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:17,249
Please...

164
00:15:20,417 --> 00:15:22,624
Well, you go in.

165
00:15:22,917 --> 00:15:26,374
You choose a woman.
You spend half an hour with her.

166
00:15:27,292 --> 00:15:29,874
And you're depressed all day.

167
00:15:30,042 --> 00:15:31,874
That's how it is...

168
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:35,374
- "Semen retentum venenum est."
- Stop it!

169
00:15:36,417 --> 00:15:38,499
I don't want to hear any more.

170
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,791
What's the matter?

171
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:48,583
I've never seen you like this.
What's wrong?

172
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:51,291
I'm a little tired and on edge.

173
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:53,583
Go and rest.

174
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,249
Yes, you're right.

175
00:15:56,417 --> 00:15:57,583
Goodnight.

176
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,249
- Shall I come with you?
- No!

177
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,458
Yes, stay until I go to sleep.

178
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:09,374
Won't you ever grow up?

179
00:16:29,792 --> 00:16:31,791
I can't hit a thing.
Take my place.

180
00:16:31,959 --> 00:16:34,874
- Are you going?
- I'll wait for you inside.

181
00:16:45,542 --> 00:16:47,666
- How are you?
- All right.

182
00:16:47,834 --> 00:16:50,958
- You don't come here much any more.
- No.

183
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:52,541
See you later.

184
00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:00,833
The mysterious Henriette!

185
00:17:05,167 --> 00:17:07,333
The woman with two sides to her.

186
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:10,499
A double life.
It's very interesting.

187
00:17:10,667 --> 00:17:12,458
Renée told you?

188
00:17:13,084 --> 00:17:14,249
But why?

189
00:17:14,417 --> 00:17:16,458
For money... that's all.

190
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,583
Nearly all women who seek revenge
do it for money.

191
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:26,499
I'm very glad to see you.

192
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:28,374
I don't understand them.

193
00:17:28,917 --> 00:17:30,833
It's the oldestjob
in the world.

194
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,499
Nowadays it's done by phone.
Women who go to "houses" are rarer.

195
00:17:36,542 --> 00:17:37,833
You should know.

196
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,708
Yes, I used to go often.

197
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:45,333
I like the atmosphere.
Women completely enslaved.

198
00:17:45,959 --> 00:17:48,291
There was one near the Opera.

199
00:17:48,459 --> 00:17:50,999
But especially Madame Anaïs.

200
00:17:51,167 --> 00:17:54,708
11, Cité Jean de Saumur.
A very fond memory.

201
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:55,958
Are you mad?

202
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:59,749
It's nothing. "Cute compulsion"
as the English say.

203
00:18:00,042 --> 00:18:02,541
lnsignificant impulses.

204
00:18:02,709 --> 00:18:06,499
One day, I want to be with you
without your husband.

205
00:18:07,042 --> 00:18:10,041
I like Pierre,
but I'd rather him not be there.

206
00:18:19,584 --> 00:18:22,916
Madame Anaïs,
11, Cité Jean de Saumur.

207
00:20:43,792 --> 00:20:45,541
Madame Anaïs
Fashions

208
00:21:09,709 --> 00:21:10,999
What's the matter?

209
00:21:48,334 --> 00:21:51,291
- What do you want?
- I'd like to speak to you.

210
00:21:57,625 --> 00:21:59,916
Is it you who...?

211
00:22:00,084 --> 00:22:01,833
I am Madame Anaïs.

212
00:22:02,084 --> 00:22:04,624
I'd like to find out if...

213
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:07,333
Come. Let's have a talk.

214
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,083
Sit down.

215
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,791
- May I offer you a drink?
- No, thanks.

216
00:22:18,042 --> 00:22:20,499
- Cigarette?
- No, thank you. I don't smoke.

217
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:23,999
Don't be afraid.
Make yourself at home.

218
00:22:24,542 --> 00:22:27,166
I think I can help you.
Sit down.

219
00:22:30,834 --> 00:22:32,708
You're charming and fresh.

220
00:22:32,959 --> 00:22:34,999
Just what they like...

221
00:22:35,167 --> 00:22:37,791
It's difficult at the start but...

222
00:22:37,959 --> 00:22:40,333
when somebody needs money...

223
00:22:42,667 --> 00:22:44,624
We go fifty-fifty.

224
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,541
I have certain expenses.

225
00:22:47,709 --> 00:22:50,499
Thank you. But I must go.

226
00:22:51,667 --> 00:22:53,916
You're a little upset.

227
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:59,124
It's the first time
you've worked?

228
00:22:59,625 --> 00:23:01,666
It's not that bad.

229
00:23:02,125 --> 00:23:05,041
The other girls aren't here yet.

230
00:23:05,292 --> 00:23:07,166
You'll lose your button...

231
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:10,166
When can you begin?

232
00:23:10,334 --> 00:23:11,749
I'm not quite sure...

233
00:23:11,917 --> 00:23:13,249
This afternoon?

234
00:23:13,417 --> 00:23:16,124
Perhaps.
It would only be the afternoon.

235
00:23:16,292 --> 00:23:19,249
I must leave at five.
I really must.

236
00:23:20,167 --> 00:23:24,499
Two to five. That's fine.
But you must be punctual.

237
00:23:25,542 --> 00:23:27,749
I promise you
you'll be free at five.

238
00:23:29,667 --> 00:23:31,333
Goodbye. Excuse me.

239
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:34,083
See you at two, then.

240
00:23:52,834 --> 00:23:54,749
Anything wrong?

241
00:23:55,667 --> 00:23:59,041
I was just out shopping
and I wanted to see you.

242
00:23:59,417 --> 00:24:01,208
But you don't like hospitals.

243
00:24:01,375 --> 00:24:02,999
No, I don't.

244
00:24:03,167 --> 00:24:06,208
I don't want to be alone.
I'll take you to lunch.

245
00:24:06,375 --> 00:24:09,791
I told you. I'm lunching
with the head surgeon.

246
00:24:09,959 --> 00:24:11,916
- I know but...
- I'm sorry.

247
00:24:12,959 --> 00:24:15,958
Don't forget our dinner
with the Fevrets this evening.

248
00:24:17,209 --> 00:24:19,624
- Sorry to bother you.
- Bother me?

249
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:22,999
See you tonight. I'll be home
as soon as possible.

250
00:25:13,375 --> 00:25:15,291
I had given you up.

251
00:25:15,459 --> 00:25:18,208
You went off in such a hurry.

252
00:25:18,542 --> 00:25:21,291
I thought I had frightened you.
Come in.

253
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,458
Put your things in here.

254
00:25:30,292 --> 00:25:32,624
You'll see the others in a moment.

255
00:25:32,792 --> 00:25:35,249
Mathilde and Charlotte.

256
00:25:35,417 --> 00:25:37,333
Both charming.

257
00:25:38,084 --> 00:25:40,999
I'll only have
well brought up girls.

258
00:25:41,167 --> 00:25:43,124
And above all, cheerful.

259
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:46,624
I like them to enjoy their work.

260
00:25:48,042 --> 00:25:51,499
Last week, I had to let
a beautiful girl go.

261
00:25:51,667 --> 00:25:54,874
Much too vulgar... Pity.

262
00:26:00,792 --> 00:26:02,749
What's your name?

263
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,416
I don't want...

264
00:26:04,625 --> 00:26:07,041
I'm not asking for your real name.

265
00:26:07,459 --> 00:26:10,333
You don't imagine my name is Anaïs!

266
00:26:11,042 --> 00:26:13,958
We'll have a drink to celebrate.

267
00:26:15,292 --> 00:26:18,416
Just a tiny one.
Cherries in brandy.

268
00:26:19,209 --> 00:26:23,041
We must find you a name.
Something simple and pretty.

269
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:25,208
Easy to remember.

270
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:27,833
Let's think of one.

271
00:26:32,542 --> 00:26:36,124
That's Monsieur Adolphe.
One of our best clients.

272
00:26:36,959 --> 00:26:39,166
You'll see, very amusing.

273
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:44,124
I've an idea.
What if we call you "Belle de Jour"?

274
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,874
Since you only come
in the afternoon.

275
00:26:47,042 --> 00:26:47,874
All right.

276
00:26:51,709 --> 00:26:53,583
Don't be so nervous.

277
00:26:54,625 --> 00:26:56,166
Relax.

278
00:26:56,334 --> 00:26:59,083
You'll leave at five,
don't worry.

279
00:27:00,459 --> 00:27:02,458
Will somebody be waiting?

280
00:27:03,375 --> 00:27:05,249
A boyfriend?

281
00:27:05,834 --> 00:27:07,208
A husband?

282
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:10,333
Don't worry.
I'm not inquisitive.

283
00:27:10,792 --> 00:27:12,333
Give me a kiss.

284
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:18,458
The ladies are thirsty.

285
00:27:18,917 --> 00:27:20,583
Wait for me here.

286
00:27:32,167 --> 00:27:34,874
A new one!
And you're hiding her!

287
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:38,958
Bring her quick.
Or I'll get her myself.

288
00:27:53,084 --> 00:27:54,749
He's very funny.

289
00:27:54,917 --> 00:27:58,041
A candy manufacturer
from Bordeaux.

290
00:27:58,625 --> 00:28:00,958
He makes millions. Come on.

291
00:28:03,209 --> 00:28:07,083
If I don't get it every day,
I can't sleep.

292
00:28:07,834 --> 00:28:09,249
The other day,

293
00:28:09,417 --> 00:28:13,333
I had a colored girl.
What a party!

294
00:28:17,334 --> 00:28:19,291
This is Belle de Jour.

295
00:28:21,959 --> 00:28:23,499
I told you about the curtains.

296
00:28:23,667 --> 00:28:28,166
My respects of a quarter to three.
Have a glass of champagne.

297
00:28:28,334 --> 00:28:30,916
Anaïs, a bottle,
and make it snappy!

298
00:28:31,125 --> 00:28:34,749
You're lucky.
When you're new, they open a bottle.

299
00:28:34,959 --> 00:28:36,999
You must have smelt the champagne!

300
00:28:39,792 --> 00:28:42,291
Get acquainted.
I'll be right back.

301
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:49,499
What a woman!
Every bit of her's good!

302
00:28:49,667 --> 00:28:51,583
Forget it.
She's too respectable.

303
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:53,541
That's just it.

304
00:28:53,709 --> 00:28:56,208
This man. Can't stop him!

305
00:28:56,459 --> 00:28:58,166
What a character!

306
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:00,458
Pretty dress!

307
00:29:00,625 --> 00:29:04,166
But not convenient for a quick strip.
Right, Monsieur Adolphe?

308
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:07,458
Oh, no, she's great in that dress.

309
00:29:07,625 --> 00:29:10,458
Very refined. I like that.

310
00:29:10,625 --> 00:29:13,874
You might give me one like that.

311
00:29:14,042 --> 00:29:16,333
My name's not Rothschild, honey.

312
00:29:16,542 --> 00:29:17,916
Shame!

313
00:29:19,292 --> 00:29:21,083
What a cut.

314
00:29:22,084 --> 00:29:23,916
Look at the detail.

315
00:29:24,084 --> 00:29:26,333
It's all a matter of money.

316
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,666
You can't buy class.

317
00:29:28,834 --> 00:29:30,249
Here's the champagne.

318
00:29:31,709 --> 00:29:33,583
About time!
I was running dry!

319
00:29:38,167 --> 00:29:40,541
Leave it! That's a man's job.

320
00:29:40,834 --> 00:29:43,958
I'm the world's champion
cork-popper.

321
00:29:44,375 --> 00:29:45,999
What wrist action!

322
00:29:46,167 --> 00:29:49,291
I like ham and eggs.

323
00:29:49,584 --> 00:29:52,583
But I love best...

324
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:56,541
a pair of legs.

325
00:29:59,042 --> 00:30:01,166
Of course, it's too warm.

326
00:30:01,334 --> 00:30:03,916
Warm champagne is like tea.

327
00:30:04,084 --> 00:30:07,458
Had I known
I'd have put it in the freezer.

328
00:30:07,625 --> 00:30:09,624
But you knew I was coming.

329
00:30:09,792 --> 00:30:11,583
I didn't know Belle de Jour was.

330
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:14,958
To the most precious
health of all...

331
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:17,791
- Mine!
- And to Belle de Jour!

332
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:22,374
Okay, but a little warm.

333
00:30:23,375 --> 00:30:26,958
Mathilde, I've a present for you.

334
00:30:30,542 --> 00:30:32,749
- What is it?
- Have a look.

335
00:30:49,042 --> 00:30:51,749
He always comes up
with something new.

336
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:53,749
Here's to fun!

337
00:30:53,959 --> 00:30:56,666
That's how I am. I like fun.

338
00:31:03,334 --> 00:31:05,374
Well, Belle de Jour...

339
00:31:05,959 --> 00:31:07,541
You're mad at us?

340
00:31:09,584 --> 00:31:11,249
What's the matter?

341
00:31:18,084 --> 00:31:19,291
You'll see...

342
00:31:20,542 --> 00:31:23,083
We'll have a good time together.

343
00:31:29,334 --> 00:31:30,749
What's eating her?

344
00:31:30,917 --> 00:31:32,624
I'll talk to her.

345
00:31:33,167 --> 00:31:35,166
Don't rush her.
It's the first time.

346
00:31:35,334 --> 00:31:38,374
- That's what you think.
- But it is.

347
00:31:43,834 --> 00:31:46,916
- Who does she think she is?
- She's new.

348
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:50,374
You've made a hit already.

349
00:31:50,834 --> 00:31:53,791
Don't worry.
He's very easy-going.

350
00:31:54,667 --> 00:31:56,874
Do what he wants, that's all.

351
00:31:57,459 --> 00:31:59,166
- I want to go.
- What?

352
00:32:00,167 --> 00:32:02,583
How much longer are you going
to play this game?

353
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:04,708
Who do you think you are?

354
00:32:06,584 --> 00:32:08,166
Very well, I'm going...

355
00:32:09,875 --> 00:32:11,458
Leave me alone with her.

356
00:32:12,292 --> 00:32:14,958
What you need is a firm hand.

357
00:32:27,667 --> 00:32:28,874
Hi!

358
00:32:29,834 --> 00:32:31,333
Close the door.

359
00:32:35,667 --> 00:32:37,541
I've sent the others away.

360
00:32:37,709 --> 00:32:39,749
It's more intimate.

361
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,791
So...

362
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:45,249
They say it's your first time.

363
00:32:47,375 --> 00:32:51,833
Careful now. Don't tell me any lies.
I can tell.

364
00:32:53,334 --> 00:32:54,624
But...

365
00:32:54,792 --> 00:32:56,333
if it's true...

366
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,624
No need to be ashamed.

367
00:32:59,167 --> 00:33:02,916
Don't tell me
you're a virgin at your age...

368
00:33:04,959 --> 00:33:06,708
We'll soon find out.

369
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,833
Well now...

370
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,208
Do I frighten you?

371
00:33:11,625 --> 00:33:13,791
Is it my face you don't like?

372
00:33:14,792 --> 00:33:17,166
You'll have to get used to it.

373
00:33:22,042 --> 00:33:24,583
You won't get out of it like that.

374
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:28,041
Who do you think you are,
little bitch!

375
00:33:28,209 --> 00:33:30,666
Leading me on,
and then stopping me.

376
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:34,666
I've had enough of your playacting.

377
00:33:41,417 --> 00:33:43,124
That's better.

378
00:33:46,042 --> 00:33:49,541
So... it's rough stuff you need,
is it?

379
00:33:55,917 --> 00:33:58,833
Jack of Clubs is my gin card.

380
00:34:03,334 --> 00:34:05,458
Adolphe is taking his time.

381
00:34:05,625 --> 00:34:07,208
So he should!

382
00:35:45,417 --> 00:35:48,499
Where are you, Severine?
Are you ready?

383
00:35:51,042 --> 00:35:52,541
Oh, you're here.

384
00:35:52,709 --> 00:35:55,499
What's wrong?
Is something the matter?

385
00:35:56,834 --> 00:35:57,708
Are you ill?

386
00:36:03,417 --> 00:36:05,666
You don't have a temperature.

387
00:36:06,125 --> 00:36:10,333
- Should I send for someone?
- It's nothing. I was asleep.

388
00:36:11,042 --> 00:36:13,249
I had a headache.

389
00:36:13,917 --> 00:36:16,458
I took an aspirin and a bath.
I'll be all right.

390
00:36:16,625 --> 00:36:18,166
What time is it?

391
00:36:18,375 --> 00:36:22,208
Late. I'll phone
and tell the Fevrets not to wait.

392
00:36:22,375 --> 00:36:24,708
- Go without me.
- Certainly not.

393
00:36:24,917 --> 00:36:28,208
It's better if I stay
and I've some work to finish.

394
00:36:30,084 --> 00:36:32,208
Sleep well.

395
00:37:00,792 --> 00:37:02,458
How's the soup?

396
00:37:05,625 --> 00:37:08,416
It's cold and I can't warm it.

397
00:37:12,959 --> 00:37:15,041
Are bulls given names like cats?

398
00:37:15,209 --> 00:37:18,291
Yes. Most of them
are called Remorse

399
00:37:18,834 --> 00:37:21,833
except the last one.
He's called Expiation.

400
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,333
What time is it?

401
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:37,624
Between two and five.
But no later than five.

402
00:37:38,584 --> 00:37:41,041
- How's your wife?
- Very well, thank you.

403
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:43,291
- Where is she?
- Just there.

404
00:37:43,459 --> 00:37:45,708
- Want to say hello?
- With pleasure.

405
00:37:45,917 --> 00:37:47,541
How are you, piece of trash?

406
00:37:47,709 --> 00:37:50,208
Feeling all right, slut?

407
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:51,958
Scum!

408
00:37:52,209 --> 00:37:53,374
Swill!

409
00:37:53,709 --> 00:37:54,874
Rubbish!

410
00:37:55,042 --> 00:37:57,458
- Dung devourer!
- Sodomite!

411
00:37:57,792 --> 00:37:59,916
- Spermentress!
- Bitch!

412
00:38:01,292 --> 00:38:03,916
Pierre, stop! I love you.

413
00:38:07,959 --> 00:38:09,749
What do you want?

414
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,958
I... I wanted...

415
00:38:12,167 --> 00:38:13,833
To come back?

416
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:17,916
And then disappear again for a week
without a word...

417
00:38:18,084 --> 00:38:22,166
- Forgive me.
- There's the street for amateurs.

418
00:38:22,459 --> 00:38:24,124
Please...

419
00:38:25,917 --> 00:38:28,124
You're lucky to be dealing with me.

420
00:38:28,292 --> 00:38:31,374
Others would have
slammed the door on you.

421
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,499
I'm too kind-hearted.

422
00:38:37,625 --> 00:38:40,833
If you come back, you must behave.

423
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:44,166
Can I count on you every day?

424
00:38:44,417 --> 00:38:46,708
But only till five.

425
00:38:51,292 --> 00:38:53,916
I'm glad to see you back.

426
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:57,583
- Belle de Jour, how are you?
- Fine, thank you.

427
00:38:57,750 --> 00:39:00,583
- You ran out on us.
- Why didn't you come sooner?

428
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:03,249
- I couldn't.
- Give me your coat.

429
00:39:04,042 --> 00:39:05,874
A cute coat!

430
00:39:06,042 --> 00:39:08,124
I've a favor to ask of you.

431
00:39:08,292 --> 00:39:11,874
Could you lend it to me for Sunday?
I'll give it back on Monday.

432
00:39:12,042 --> 00:39:16,708
Well... I'm sorry,
but Sunday is a little difficult.

433
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:20,083
- Couldn't you...?
- It's OK. I saw it in ready-made.

434
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:23,333
Carducci!
Some people do themselves proud!

435
00:39:24,292 --> 00:39:25,791
Who are you?

436
00:39:27,917 --> 00:39:29,874
Are you sad to be back?

437
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:34,999
I come here because my fiancé
had an accident and can't work.

438
00:39:35,459 --> 00:39:38,416
He knows I come here.
But I love him.

439
00:39:39,125 --> 00:39:41,499
Of course I could get a job.

440
00:39:41,667 --> 00:39:43,916
- What would you earn?
- True.

441
00:39:45,084 --> 00:39:47,541
The professor will be here
any minute.

442
00:39:47,875 --> 00:39:49,958
You must meet him.

443
00:39:50,125 --> 00:39:52,999
- You're his type.
- Who is he?

444
00:39:53,417 --> 00:39:56,124
A famous gynaecologist.

445
00:39:56,334 --> 00:39:57,999
He has an international reputation.

446
00:39:58,167 --> 00:40:00,374
He's even operated in Copenhagen.

447
00:40:01,709 --> 00:40:04,666
There he is.
Explain things to her.

448
00:40:06,709 --> 00:40:08,499
It's dark already.

449
00:40:11,334 --> 00:40:14,999
You'll see, it's not difficult.
If only they were all like him!

450
00:40:16,709 --> 00:40:18,499
I have a new one.

451
00:40:18,667 --> 00:40:22,041
I think you'll like her.
A bit shy but...

452
00:40:22,209 --> 00:40:24,166
a real aristocrat.

453
00:40:25,417 --> 00:40:28,541
So much the better.
Send her to me.

454
00:41:50,792 --> 00:41:52,208
What are you doing?

455
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,833
Didn't they tell you?
Get dressed.

456
00:42:13,792 --> 00:42:15,458
Her Ladyship sent for me?

457
00:42:20,459 --> 00:42:23,083
Is Her Ladyship
not satisfied with me?

458
00:42:23,334 --> 00:42:24,624
Well...

459
00:42:25,167 --> 00:42:26,416
no...

460
00:42:35,625 --> 00:42:37,666
You belong in the kitchen...

461
00:42:38,834 --> 00:42:41,083
She's useless. Send me Charlotte.

462
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:42,541
Right away.

463
00:42:43,417 --> 00:42:44,833
You come with me.

464
00:42:52,459 --> 00:42:54,333
Charlotte, go to the professor.

465
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:56,458
Just a sec.
I'll finish undressing.

466
00:42:56,625 --> 00:42:59,208
Get in! It's not that difficult!

467
00:43:11,084 --> 00:43:12,458
Stand here!

468
00:43:15,792 --> 00:43:17,999
Watch how Charlotte does it.

469
00:43:18,167 --> 00:43:19,916
And be very quiet.

470
00:43:41,709 --> 00:43:43,374
Her Ladyship sent for me?

471
00:43:44,417 --> 00:43:46,666
Is Her Ladyship
not satisfied with me?

472
00:43:46,834 --> 00:43:48,999
You make a mess of everything.

473
00:43:50,125 --> 00:43:52,833
It's true. I do.

474
00:43:53,792 --> 00:43:57,249
But Her Ladyship is so kind
and so forgiving.

475
00:43:57,417 --> 00:43:59,624
- And so beautiful.
- Impudent!

476
00:44:02,834 --> 00:44:04,166
Look!

477
00:44:04,709 --> 00:44:07,166
You must be blind.
Can't you see?

478
00:44:07,334 --> 00:44:11,583
There's dust everywhere...
There! And there!

479
00:44:15,084 --> 00:44:16,583
I broke a vase...

480
00:44:16,792 --> 00:44:18,916
A vase! That's it!

481
00:44:19,084 --> 00:44:20,458
This time you're fired.

482
00:44:20,625 --> 00:44:24,333
No! I implore Her Ladyship
to keep me.

483
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:28,999
Keep me near her. I'll make up for it.
I'll be very careful, I swear.

484
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:32,624
- Not yet, Charlotte. Give it here!
- Oh, sorry.

485
00:44:33,334 --> 00:44:35,541
I implore Her Ladyship
to punish me...

486
00:44:35,917 --> 00:44:37,416
To beat me.

487
00:44:37,709 --> 00:44:39,416
But not to send me away.

488
00:44:39,584 --> 00:44:41,124
What are you doing?
You're disgusting.

489
00:44:41,292 --> 00:44:43,374
I'm not doing anything.

490
00:44:43,625 --> 00:44:45,791
I don't dare... alas!

491
00:44:45,959 --> 00:44:47,541
I ought not to say it...

492
00:44:47,709 --> 00:44:49,583
It's a secret...

493
00:44:50,042 --> 00:44:51,999
- I love you...
- What?

494
00:44:54,792 --> 00:44:56,124
I love you.

495
00:44:57,667 --> 00:44:59,541
And now that I have told you...

496
00:45:00,125 --> 00:45:02,333
of my great love...

497
00:45:03,709 --> 00:45:05,208
Kick me

498
00:45:05,417 --> 00:45:07,374
and spit on me.
Walk over my face.

499
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:12,916
You dirty old man.
You swine. I'll teach you...

500
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:25,916
Come on. Somebody's waiting.

501
00:45:28,209 --> 00:45:29,916
Well, did you see?

502
00:45:30,084 --> 00:45:31,624
What do you think?

503
00:45:32,292 --> 00:45:34,374
How can anyone sink so low?

504
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,624
I suppose you're used to it.
But I'm not.

505
00:45:45,125 --> 00:45:47,708
Not me, thank you.

506
00:45:52,209 --> 00:45:54,958
How about this one?

507
00:46:03,459 --> 00:46:04,874
What's this?

508
00:46:07,834 --> 00:46:11,249
That's no good here. Cash!

509
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:22,041
Very good. Off you go.

510
00:47:10,625 --> 00:47:12,374
Don't be afraid.

511
00:47:53,459 --> 00:47:54,999
- Did you work hard?
- Yes, mom.

512
00:47:55,167 --> 00:47:56,624
Have you been good?

513
00:47:56,792 --> 00:47:59,916
Say good afternoon to auntie.
Show her your grades.

514
00:48:01,459 --> 00:48:02,958
Hello, Cathy.

515
00:48:04,834 --> 00:48:06,624
Show me your report card.

516
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:10,833
Don't you say hello to me?

517
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,708
Hello, Miss Mathilde.

518
00:48:14,375 --> 00:48:17,916
I'll take you to the fair on Sunday.
Would you like that?

519
00:48:19,542 --> 00:48:21,749
7 in history, 9 in recital.
Very good.

520
00:48:28,250 --> 00:48:30,541
The professor wants an inkpot.

521
00:48:31,334 --> 00:48:33,624
- What's going on?
- He wants an inkpot.

522
00:48:33,792 --> 00:48:37,708
An inkpot? I haven't got one.

523
00:49:02,125 --> 00:49:04,624
Go upstairs and do your homework.

524
00:49:33,459 --> 00:49:35,916
That man would frighten me too.

525
00:49:36,875 --> 00:49:39,541
It must be painful sometimes...

526
00:49:41,459 --> 00:49:43,624
How would you know, Pallas?

527
00:50:30,125 --> 00:50:31,541
May I, Miss?

528
00:50:31,834 --> 00:50:33,291
Of course you may.

529
00:50:36,709 --> 00:50:38,166
Miss or Missus?

530
00:50:39,542 --> 00:50:41,124
Fine.

531
00:50:42,542 --> 00:50:43,958
What is your name?

532
00:50:44,125 --> 00:50:45,791
Belle de Jour.

533
00:50:45,959 --> 00:50:47,541
Charming!

534
00:50:47,709 --> 00:50:51,041
I had a cat
called Beauty of Twilight.

535
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,916
You come here often?

536
00:50:55,584 --> 00:50:57,458
Every day in my thoughts.

537
00:51:00,084 --> 00:51:02,208
A pleasant morning, isn't it?

538
00:51:02,375 --> 00:51:04,083
Yes, it is.

539
00:51:04,542 --> 00:51:07,666
I much enjoy the autumn sun.

540
00:51:08,125 --> 00:51:10,166
The black sun.

541
00:51:12,875 --> 00:51:15,208
You are very elegant.

542
00:51:17,084 --> 00:51:18,916
Do you like money?

543
00:51:20,250 --> 00:51:21,416
Yes.

544
00:51:21,834 --> 00:51:24,541
I'll give you a lot
if you come home with me.

545
00:51:24,709 --> 00:51:25,541
With you?

546
00:51:25,709 --> 00:51:29,166
Have no fear.
It's a sort of ceremony.

547
00:51:29,834 --> 00:51:33,291
A very moving religious ceremony
that means a lot to me.

548
00:51:33,625 --> 00:51:36,041
I am a man of another age...

549
00:51:36,334 --> 00:51:39,041
an age when there was
a feeling for death.

550
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,666
You would make me very happy
if you'd come.

551
00:51:44,042 --> 00:51:46,708
You're just the girl
I'm looking for.

552
00:51:47,875 --> 00:51:49,708
I live an hour away from Paris.

553
00:51:50,459 --> 00:51:52,083
Here's my card.

554
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,916
I will meet you at the station.

555
00:52:33,875 --> 00:52:36,374
Kindly put this on.

556
00:52:36,584 --> 00:52:38,291
What's it all about?

557
00:52:39,250 --> 00:52:41,958
Don't be alarmed.

558
00:52:42,750 --> 00:52:46,291
Those who preceded you
would like to come back.

559
00:52:46,792 --> 00:52:49,499
But the Duke is very strict
on this matter.

560
00:52:54,917 --> 00:52:56,791
Please walk this way.

561
00:53:45,667 --> 00:53:47,958
I brought you lilies...

562
00:53:48,667 --> 00:53:50,374
that you loved so much.

563
00:53:51,375 --> 00:53:52,999
How beautiful you are!

564
00:53:54,209 --> 00:53:56,291
Your skin is whiter...

565
00:53:57,959 --> 00:54:00,416
and your hair softer.

566
00:54:12,959 --> 00:54:14,958
My beloved daughter.

567
00:54:20,792 --> 00:54:22,916
Your face is cold.

568
00:54:24,584 --> 00:54:27,624
Do you remember...
we used to play here together?

569
00:54:28,250 --> 00:54:30,708
How we laughed and sang!

570
00:54:32,875 --> 00:54:35,666
Now you just lie there

571
00:54:36,250 --> 00:54:37,916
and say nothing.

572
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:41,916
I hope you have forgiven me.

573
00:54:42,417 --> 00:54:44,874
It's not my fault.
I loved you so much.

574
00:54:45,834 --> 00:54:48,416
Your Lordship,
shall I let the cats in?

575
00:54:48,625 --> 00:54:50,624
Go to hell with your cats!

576
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:57,499
We are quite alone.

577
00:54:59,209 --> 00:55:01,083
The doors are all closed.

578
00:55:07,792 --> 00:55:09,333
Now...

579
00:55:10,167 --> 00:55:12,541
your eyes will never open again.

580
00:55:13,584 --> 00:55:15,624
Your limbs are stiff.

581
00:55:17,417 --> 00:55:19,624
Worms are eating your heart.

582
00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:25,208
And this sickly odor
of dead flowers.

583
00:56:01,542 --> 00:56:03,791
Still here?
What are you waiting for?

584
00:56:03,959 --> 00:56:05,749
But it's raining and...

585
00:56:06,125 --> 00:56:07,791
So what?

586
00:56:09,209 --> 00:56:11,249
Get the hell out of here!

587
00:56:11,542 --> 00:56:12,999
Go on, out!

588
00:56:37,209 --> 00:56:38,749
Are you almost finished?

589
00:56:38,917 --> 00:56:40,166
Coming.

590
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:55,374
Shall I stay with you?

591
00:57:07,750 --> 00:57:10,083
I only wish you'd stay more often...

592
00:57:10,250 --> 00:57:11,916
of your own free will.

593
00:57:12,084 --> 00:57:14,749
I will, Pierre. Give me time.

594
00:57:14,917 --> 00:57:18,374
I always feel I'm imposing on you.

595
00:57:18,750 --> 00:57:20,624
Don't believe that.

596
00:57:20,792 --> 00:57:23,208
More and more
I want to be alone with you.

597
00:57:23,875 --> 00:57:25,833
You don't frighten me now.

598
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:30,458
I feel that I understand you better,
that I'm getting closer to you.

599
00:57:31,625 --> 00:57:33,916
Every day I love you more.

600
00:57:46,709 --> 00:57:48,208
Is Madame at home?

601
00:57:49,417 --> 00:57:51,624
- Whom shall I say?
- Monsieur Husson.

602
00:57:55,334 --> 00:57:57,583
Monsieur Husson to see you,
Madame.

603
00:57:58,292 --> 00:58:00,083
Tell him I'm not at home.

604
00:58:08,334 --> 00:58:10,416
Good afternoon, Miss. Thank you.

605
00:58:23,584 --> 00:58:26,041
How seductive you are!

606
00:58:27,084 --> 00:58:29,333
I feel like writing a letter.

607
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:31,124
I'd be delighted.

608
00:58:31,375 --> 00:58:33,083
But would you accept?

609
00:58:34,250 --> 00:58:35,791
There are too many people here.

610
00:58:35,959 --> 00:58:37,541
All the better!

611
00:58:37,709 --> 00:58:40,041
I must give you a receipt.

612
00:58:40,209 --> 00:58:41,708
I'm relying on it.

613
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,583
With that?

614
00:58:54,625 --> 00:58:56,208
What are they doing?

615
00:58:57,459 --> 00:59:00,749
Nothing. Just fooling around.
Have a look.

616
00:59:00,917 --> 00:59:02,624
No. You tell me.

617
00:59:03,959 --> 00:59:06,249
- He's taking an envelope.
- And?

618
00:59:07,459 --> 00:59:09,708
No... it's a packet of lily seeds.

619
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,874
Oh yes, I see.

620
01:00:07,417 --> 01:00:09,583
- What floor?
- Fourth.

621
01:00:15,250 --> 01:00:16,833
What are you doing?

622
01:00:17,834 --> 01:00:19,791
Help!

623
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:25,708
Don't do anything stupid.
You're crazy.

624
01:00:26,584 --> 01:00:28,166
Hurry up! Quickly!

625
01:01:19,750 --> 01:01:22,583
Well, Hippolyte!
How about that?

626
01:01:22,750 --> 01:01:25,333
Hello, Anaïs.
Can we come in?

627
01:01:26,125 --> 01:01:27,666
Of course.

628
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,208
Through there.

629
01:01:45,542 --> 01:01:47,666
- It's Hippolyte.
- From Murcia?

630
01:01:48,084 --> 01:01:50,249
I'd hoped we were rid of him.

631
01:01:50,625 --> 01:01:52,499
I don't know the other one.

632
01:01:52,917 --> 01:01:54,124
Who is Hippolyte?

633
01:01:54,292 --> 01:01:57,208
Who knows? A strange kind of guy.

634
01:01:57,875 --> 01:01:59,916
He spends money like water.

635
01:02:00,084 --> 01:02:02,499
But when he's broke,
he gets it free.

636
01:02:03,417 --> 01:02:05,833
Come along, girls.
All three of you.

637
01:02:14,750 --> 01:02:16,583
How's the little one?

638
01:02:17,375 --> 01:02:19,208
Is she ready to be kissed?

639
01:02:19,375 --> 01:02:22,166
I don't know, Sir.
She has to finish school.

640
01:02:22,334 --> 01:02:23,874
Great!

641
01:02:29,542 --> 01:02:31,124
You won't complain.

642
01:02:35,209 --> 01:02:36,666
What does that mean?

643
01:02:37,959 --> 01:02:39,291
How are you?

644
01:02:39,542 --> 01:02:41,833
- Okay, and you?
- We keep going.

645
01:02:42,209 --> 01:02:44,958
We haven't seen you for months.

646
01:02:45,125 --> 01:02:47,208
- We missed you a lot.
- Really?

647
01:02:47,375 --> 01:02:49,833
- Where were you?
- On a trip.

648
01:02:50,334 --> 01:02:51,791
New York.

649
01:02:54,875 --> 01:02:57,958
Put three bottles on ice.
Good ones.

650
01:02:58,334 --> 01:02:59,916
The best.

651
01:03:06,292 --> 01:03:08,958
What you miss most abroad

652
01:03:09,167 --> 01:03:10,874
is champagne.

653
01:03:14,792 --> 01:03:18,374
I've brought someone with me.
He's a buddy.

654
01:03:18,709 --> 01:03:21,166
Treat him... good.

655
01:03:21,584 --> 01:03:23,458
Of course we will.

656
01:03:25,917 --> 01:03:29,249
When we're alone, I'll tell you
a new story. You'll like it.

657
01:03:29,417 --> 01:03:31,249
You can keep it.

658
01:03:31,417 --> 01:03:32,791
Too bad for you.

659
01:03:34,834 --> 01:03:36,583
Get off. You're too heavy.

660
01:03:36,750 --> 01:03:38,208
Well I never...

661
01:03:38,417 --> 01:03:40,749
You scram too. You're tickling.

662
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:44,833
Come here, you.
The new girl.

663
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:53,083
Leave her to me.

664
01:03:59,084 --> 01:04:02,916
Take her, kid, if you want her.
Have fun. She's your age.

665
01:04:12,459 --> 01:04:14,791
I'd have slit my father's throat
for less.

666
01:04:15,042 --> 01:04:19,499
But friendship comes first.
We mustn't fight over una zorra.

667
01:04:24,209 --> 01:04:25,583
Say...

668
01:04:25,875 --> 01:04:27,249
Your friend seems timid.

669
01:04:27,417 --> 01:04:28,583
Timid isn't the word.

670
01:04:29,542 --> 01:04:32,208
The champagne's served.
Aren't you thirsty?

671
01:04:36,959 --> 01:04:39,624
- What's your name?
- Belle de Jour.

672
01:04:40,334 --> 01:04:41,708
What else?

673
01:04:42,084 --> 01:04:43,124
Nothing.

674
01:04:43,292 --> 01:04:44,583
Don't you trust me?

675
01:04:45,417 --> 01:04:47,208
I want to know your name.

676
01:04:48,875 --> 01:04:52,333
Aren't you here at night?
What do you do then?

677
01:04:54,084 --> 01:04:55,666
Nice boots!

678
01:05:01,667 --> 01:05:03,291
Your teeth...

679
01:05:03,459 --> 01:05:04,791
What happened?

680
01:05:05,459 --> 01:05:07,333
Knocked out in one blow.

681
01:05:09,709 --> 01:05:11,458
Does it bother you?

682
01:05:11,959 --> 01:05:13,666
Then make it fast.

683
01:05:18,959 --> 01:05:21,166
- How old are you?
- 23.

684
01:05:22,209 --> 01:05:23,916
Who protects you?

685
01:05:24,167 --> 01:05:25,499
What do you mean?

686
01:05:25,667 --> 01:05:27,124
Are you free or not?

687
01:05:28,542 --> 01:05:30,916
Make plenty of money?

688
01:05:31,917 --> 01:05:33,166
Yes, but...

689
01:05:33,375 --> 01:05:35,416
Don't tell me any lies.

690
01:05:35,792 --> 01:05:37,541
Keep your stockings on.

691
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:40,708
A girl once tried to strangle me.

692
01:05:41,584 --> 01:05:43,041
Poor thing...

693
01:05:43,209 --> 01:05:44,749
With you, it's free.

694
01:05:46,459 --> 01:05:47,999
Naturally!

695
01:05:48,292 --> 01:05:50,916
Many would like to be in your place.

696
01:05:52,084 --> 01:05:53,958
Still won't tell me your name?

697
01:05:55,209 --> 01:05:56,833
You don't talk much.

698
01:05:57,250 --> 01:06:00,374
Good. Can't stand girls
who chatter.

699
01:06:01,917 --> 01:06:03,666
Not bad.

700
01:06:05,709 --> 01:06:07,583
Shame you only have two of them.

701
01:06:08,042 --> 01:06:09,499
Let's see.

702
01:06:09,834 --> 01:06:11,249
Turn around.

703
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,833
What's that brown spot?

704
01:06:16,125 --> 01:06:17,499
A birthmark.

705
01:06:17,667 --> 01:06:19,874
Oh hell! I don't like that!

706
01:06:20,459 --> 01:06:21,999
Get dressed.

707
01:06:26,084 --> 01:06:28,499
Not cold enough, as usual.

708
01:06:28,667 --> 01:06:29,958
You read English?

709
01:06:30,125 --> 01:06:32,458
- Me? No.
- So why the paper?

710
01:06:32,834 --> 01:06:34,291
What's it to do with you?

711
01:06:38,250 --> 01:06:39,499
Enough!

712
01:06:40,334 --> 01:06:42,999
Take that one to the room.
I'll join you.

713
01:06:43,334 --> 01:06:45,083
The other's for Marcel.

714
01:06:47,292 --> 01:06:48,958
Who is your friend?

715
01:06:49,417 --> 01:06:52,791
He saved my life last year.
I love him like a son.

716
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,708
That's why I let him
have the blonde.

717
01:06:55,875 --> 01:06:57,416
Where does she come from?

718
01:06:57,584 --> 01:06:59,291
- Belle de Jour?
- Yes.

719
01:06:59,459 --> 01:07:01,208
Is she much in demand?

720
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:02,749
All the time.

721
01:07:03,167 --> 01:07:05,249
She not only has class but...

722
01:07:05,459 --> 01:07:07,041
What?

723
01:07:07,209 --> 01:07:08,916
She's a pearl.

724
01:07:16,792 --> 01:07:18,541
I thought you wanted to go.

725
01:07:19,209 --> 01:07:20,958
I'm glad I stayed.

726
01:07:21,209 --> 01:07:24,291
I'll tell you. You're my type.

727
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:29,666
Look at my hand.
It's still trembling.

728
01:07:33,875 --> 01:07:35,333
What's that?

729
01:07:36,250 --> 01:07:37,666
A buttonhole.

730
01:07:37,834 --> 01:07:40,083
- A knife wound?
- Possibly.

731
01:07:41,042 --> 01:07:42,624
Why do you come here?

732
01:07:42,834 --> 01:07:44,541
Don't ask me anything.

733
01:07:45,375 --> 01:07:47,999
I'd like to keep you till tonight
but I can't.

734
01:07:48,584 --> 01:07:50,624
I like you too, Marcel.

735
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,374
You'll come back?

736
01:07:52,584 --> 01:07:53,958
It's possible.

737
01:07:54,375 --> 01:07:57,083
- If you've no money, I can...
- Money!

738
01:07:57,917 --> 01:07:59,666
It's not money I need.

739
01:08:00,292 --> 01:08:01,749
You frighten me.

740
01:08:30,792 --> 01:08:33,124
- I can see you're bored.
- No.

741
01:08:33,292 --> 01:08:35,374
I just want to go back to Paris.

742
01:08:36,417 --> 01:08:38,583
You know you can tell me
everything,

743
01:08:38,750 --> 01:08:40,541
but you're hiding something.

744
01:08:42,167 --> 01:08:45,374
If only you'd confide in me,
perhaps I could help you.

745
01:08:45,542 --> 01:08:46,958
Confide what?

746
01:08:47,875 --> 01:08:49,624
That you love someone.

747
01:08:49,792 --> 01:08:51,499
Someone else?

748
01:08:52,292 --> 01:08:54,166
You know I couldn't.

749
01:08:55,250 --> 01:08:57,083
I suggested this holiday

750
01:08:57,250 --> 01:08:59,749
to find out if something
was keeping you in Paris.

751
01:08:59,917 --> 01:09:02,166
I was right.
You want to go back.

752
01:09:02,917 --> 01:09:04,999
Above all I feel...

753
01:09:05,375 --> 01:09:07,208
your aloofness.

754
01:09:07,459 --> 01:09:09,958
You're never really...
with me.

755
01:09:10,125 --> 01:09:11,458
Forgive me.

756
01:09:12,875 --> 01:09:14,541
It's probably my fault.

757
01:09:14,875 --> 01:09:16,999
You believe I don't love you?

758
01:09:17,292 --> 01:09:18,791
Yes, I think so.

759
01:09:24,459 --> 01:09:26,541
I don't know how to explain.

760
01:09:27,542 --> 01:09:30,499
There are many things
I don't understand myself.

761
01:09:30,709 --> 01:09:32,499
Things about myself.

762
01:09:33,042 --> 01:09:35,624
My feelings for you
have nothing to do with pleasure.

763
01:09:35,792 --> 01:09:37,458
It's much more than that.

764
01:09:37,625 --> 01:09:41,666
You may not believe this,
but I've never felt so close to you.

765
01:09:42,625 --> 01:09:44,166
You want to go back to Paris?

766
01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:46,499
But I'm not bored with you.

767
01:09:46,667 --> 01:09:48,499
Let's stay another week.

768
01:09:48,667 --> 01:09:51,833
No, we'll leave tomorrow.
I must go back anyway.

769
01:10:08,667 --> 01:10:09,999
See you soon.

770
01:10:11,292 --> 01:10:12,666
Troubles, Mr. Marcel?

771
01:10:12,834 --> 01:10:15,916
Never seen anyone
hooked like you are.

772
01:10:16,084 --> 01:10:17,208
Stop it, will you!

773
01:10:17,375 --> 01:10:20,749
Behaving like an imbecile,
not like a man.

774
01:10:29,542 --> 01:10:31,666
We waited for you Thursday.

775
01:10:32,459 --> 01:10:35,541
- So what?
- Next time, we won't wait. Get me?

776
01:10:35,959 --> 01:10:37,541
We nearly didn't come today either.

777
01:10:37,709 --> 01:10:38,791
Really?

778
01:10:39,459 --> 01:10:43,708
The inflation's lasted long enough.
We're sick of you and your goon.

779
01:10:44,375 --> 01:10:46,874
Not with that yellow rat.

780
01:10:47,834 --> 01:10:51,499
Please, gentlemen, go outside.

781
01:10:51,917 --> 01:10:53,833
Shut your trap!

782
01:10:55,209 --> 01:10:58,124
The snow.
We know you've got it.

783
01:11:04,542 --> 01:11:06,458
We're not keeping you.

784
01:11:09,125 --> 01:11:10,583
I'll settle with you
about the goon.

785
01:11:12,292 --> 01:11:13,833
As you like.

786
01:11:43,667 --> 01:11:46,458
Pierrot, an anisette.

787
01:11:55,959 --> 01:11:57,249
Where are you going?

788
01:11:57,417 --> 01:11:59,249
- To phone.
- Again?

789
01:12:03,334 --> 01:12:06,083
What a curse these women are!

790
01:12:06,250 --> 01:12:09,583
How right you are. He's hooked.

791
01:12:09,792 --> 01:12:13,458
It's cost him dearly.
It's always been his trouble.

792
01:12:13,625 --> 01:12:15,916
But I can't do anything.

793
01:12:16,084 --> 01:12:18,458
Hello, Anaïs. It's Marcel.

794
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,374
Any news?

795
01:12:22,167 --> 01:12:23,666
Since when?

796
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,583
Really?

797
01:12:27,625 --> 01:12:28,916
I'm on my way.

798
01:12:36,417 --> 01:12:39,499
He had his father on his back.

799
01:12:41,042 --> 01:12:43,583
Six letters with an A.

800
01:12:44,167 --> 01:12:46,499
Aeneas.

801
01:12:47,167 --> 01:12:50,416
You're right!
It often comes up in crosswords.

802
01:12:52,334 --> 01:12:55,208
Belle, it's him again.
He's waiting for you.

803
01:13:06,667 --> 01:13:08,874
Hello. How are you?

804
01:13:15,417 --> 01:13:17,999
Where have you been?
And why?

805
01:13:18,625 --> 01:13:21,083
I had to go away for a few days.

806
01:13:21,250 --> 01:13:23,958
- I'll explain.
- I'll explain too.

807
01:13:24,125 --> 01:13:26,333
And leave my signature.

808
01:13:33,250 --> 01:13:35,249
Don't mark my face.

809
01:13:39,250 --> 01:13:41,916
If you do that again,
I'll go away forever.

810
01:13:45,209 --> 01:13:47,041
Okay for this time.

811
01:14:12,417 --> 01:14:14,083
I missed you, you know.

812
01:14:15,459 --> 01:14:17,833
I shouldn't say this,
but I waited for you.

813
01:14:18,792 --> 01:14:21,833
Now I want to see more of you...
at night too.

814
01:14:22,292 --> 01:14:24,208
You can see me every day.

815
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:27,833
- You know I'm not free.
- I don't care.

816
01:14:41,792 --> 01:14:43,333
I don't understand.

817
01:14:44,542 --> 01:14:46,416
You seem to like being with me.

818
01:14:46,584 --> 01:14:49,624
Very much.
But it's not enough.

819
01:14:50,375 --> 01:14:52,458
You love the other guy?

820
01:14:53,959 --> 01:14:55,708
Why come here then?

821
01:14:55,917 --> 01:14:59,166
I don't know...
It's two different things.

822
01:15:24,375 --> 01:15:26,124
I'm starving.
Where shall we eat?

823
01:15:26,292 --> 01:15:28,333
Let's decide on the way.

824
01:15:28,542 --> 01:15:31,166
I won't be long. I'll be back by 3.

825
01:15:32,625 --> 01:15:35,041
I scarcely recognize you.

826
01:15:35,292 --> 01:15:38,624
- I'm so glad to see you smile.
- I certainly feel better.

827
01:15:38,792 --> 01:15:40,541
I've never seen you like this.

828
01:15:40,709 --> 01:15:42,499
- If only...
- What?

829
01:15:42,875 --> 01:15:46,083
Oh, nothing. But if only you had
some great news for me one day.

830
01:15:46,250 --> 01:15:48,833
- What do you mean?
- You know very well...

831
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:52,166
What I want most of all: a child.

832
01:16:07,792 --> 01:16:10,624
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing.

833
01:16:11,375 --> 01:16:14,666
This thing. I don't know why.
It's odd.

834
01:16:14,959 --> 01:16:17,916
- Nothing odd about it.
- No, you're right.

835
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:29,249
Hello, stranger!
I hardly recognized you.

836
01:16:29,542 --> 01:16:33,416
You forgot about us, didn't you?
We haven't seen you for ages.

837
01:16:34,042 --> 01:16:36,166
You haven't changed much.

838
01:16:36,334 --> 01:16:38,041
First door on the right.

839
01:16:42,292 --> 01:16:45,374
Come here, girls.
It's an old friend.

840
01:16:47,834 --> 01:16:50,208
Come along. Get moving.

841
01:16:55,292 --> 01:16:57,291
Yes, you're all lovely.

842
01:16:59,625 --> 01:17:01,874
- You flatter me.
- Not at all, Sir.

843
01:17:02,042 --> 01:17:03,833
I remember you very well.

844
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,999
Sometimes, I even dream of you.

845
01:17:08,167 --> 01:17:09,916
I don't care much for that.

846
01:17:10,167 --> 01:17:12,499
- Oh no, Sir.
- I insist.

847
01:17:17,709 --> 01:17:19,791
Hello, ladies.
Please sit down.

848
01:17:20,375 --> 01:17:23,541
Mathilde, Charlotte
and Belle de Jour.

849
01:17:24,084 --> 01:17:26,791
Belle de Jour? Original name.

850
01:17:28,584 --> 01:17:30,708
Shall I get you a drink?

851
01:17:31,167 --> 01:17:32,708
Later on.

852
01:17:34,209 --> 01:17:35,874
Nothing has changed here.

853
01:17:36,042 --> 01:17:38,624
Still the same simple,
friendly welcome.

854
01:17:39,292 --> 01:17:41,166
The same curtains...

855
01:17:42,375 --> 01:17:44,958
What happened
to the lion tamer girl?

856
01:17:46,959 --> 01:17:48,208
I don't know.

857
01:17:48,375 --> 01:17:50,499
The heating's turned on full?

858
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,458
You haven't changed either.

859
01:17:52,625 --> 01:17:54,583
And the armchair...

860
01:17:56,875 --> 01:17:58,416
It was snowing.

861
01:17:59,125 --> 01:18:01,374
Still the same unusual perfume.

862
01:18:01,542 --> 01:18:03,374
Faithful to jasmine...

863
01:18:03,917 --> 01:18:06,124
You'll stay for a while, I hope.

864
01:18:06,542 --> 01:18:08,749
All my life. I've plenty of time.

865
01:18:11,417 --> 01:18:13,958
I'd like to be alone
with Belle de Jour.

866
01:18:19,500 --> 01:18:21,374
No! I don't want to.

867
01:18:21,792 --> 01:18:23,333
What is this?

868
01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:25,083
Stay here!

869
01:18:27,709 --> 01:18:29,791
She's very nice...

870
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,249
But she can be a bit nervous.

871
01:18:36,667 --> 01:18:38,416
Pleased with yourself?

872
01:18:38,750 --> 01:18:41,041
You knew I was here.

873
01:18:41,459 --> 01:18:42,916
You are mistaken.

874
01:18:43,084 --> 01:18:45,916
It's your fault.
You gave me the address.

875
01:18:46,542 --> 01:18:48,708
- You're mistaken.
- Don't come near me

876
01:18:48,875 --> 01:18:51,124
or I'll jump out of the window.

877
01:18:57,709 --> 01:18:58,999
Is that your bed?

878
01:18:59,167 --> 01:19:01,041
You disgust me,
you know that.

879
01:19:01,209 --> 01:19:04,333
Yes, that's my bed.
What else do you want to know?

880
01:19:05,292 --> 01:19:07,083
You like being humiliated.

881
01:19:07,250 --> 01:19:08,708
I don't.

882
01:19:10,334 --> 01:19:12,124
Don't tell Pierre!

883
01:19:12,667 --> 01:19:15,624
I admire him more and more.

884
01:19:17,084 --> 01:19:19,166
Please, don't tell him.

885
01:19:19,709 --> 01:19:21,916
Try to understand.

886
01:19:22,125 --> 01:19:23,583
I'm lost.

887
01:19:24,125 --> 01:19:27,499
It happens in spite of me.
I can't resist.

888
01:19:28,542 --> 01:19:31,458
One day I shall have to pay
for my sins.

889
01:19:32,459 --> 01:19:34,833
But without this I could not live.

890
01:19:36,625 --> 01:19:38,541
Do whatever you want with me.

891
01:19:40,709 --> 01:19:42,291
Not now, in any case...

892
01:19:42,750 --> 01:19:47,166
What attracted me about you was...
your virtue.

893
01:19:47,375 --> 01:19:51,041
You were the wife of a boy scout.
That has all changed.

894
01:19:51,834 --> 01:19:53,999
I have principles.
I am not like you.

895
01:19:54,167 --> 01:19:57,166
I shall, of course,
say nothing to Pierre.

896
01:19:58,209 --> 01:20:01,583
But I have friends
who would be good customers.

897
01:20:03,292 --> 01:20:05,124
Forgive me.

898
01:20:05,459 --> 01:20:07,291
I really don't feel like it.

899
01:20:08,667 --> 01:20:10,708
Another time, perhaps.

900
01:20:10,875 --> 01:20:12,333
Who knows?

901
01:20:12,500 --> 01:20:14,541
I don't want to waste your time.

902
01:20:21,875 --> 01:20:25,624
This isn't for you. Buy some
chocolates for Pierre from me.

903
01:21:14,834 --> 01:21:16,874
All set? Go!

904
01:21:22,084 --> 01:21:23,541
Get ready.

905
01:21:24,084 --> 01:21:24,916
Fire!

906
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:05,874
He's gone already?

907
01:22:06,750 --> 01:22:08,583
I want to speak to you.

908
01:22:09,792 --> 01:22:10,999
Run along.

909
01:22:18,667 --> 01:22:20,499
- I must go away.
- When?

910
01:22:20,667 --> 01:22:23,249
- Now.
- You'll come back?

911
01:22:23,459 --> 01:22:25,458
- No, I won't.
- What?

912
01:22:26,584 --> 01:22:28,958
You might have told me
a little sooner.

913
01:22:29,125 --> 01:22:30,499
Aren't you happy here?

914
01:22:30,667 --> 01:22:32,499
Oh yes, only...

915
01:22:32,959 --> 01:22:34,541
Yes, I understand...

916
01:22:36,417 --> 01:22:38,041
It's Marcel.

917
01:22:38,959 --> 01:22:41,041
He was here just now.
He was furious.

918
01:22:41,209 --> 01:22:43,416
Nearly broke into your room.

919
01:22:44,209 --> 01:22:46,749
Something's not right.

920
01:22:47,625 --> 01:22:49,416
He's become too demanding.

921
01:22:49,584 --> 01:22:53,208
He wants you for himself
day and night.

922
01:22:57,334 --> 01:22:59,666
Always the same trouble with men.

923
01:23:00,917 --> 01:23:03,208
Go away. You're quite right.

924
01:23:03,959 --> 01:23:06,541
One of these days
there could be trouble.

925
01:23:07,625 --> 01:23:09,583
But I'll be sorry to lose you.

926
01:23:10,250 --> 01:23:12,291
Women like you are...

927
01:23:13,084 --> 01:23:16,416
- We got on well, you and me.
- Yes, that's true.

928
01:23:16,667 --> 01:23:20,541
Keep in touch if you can.
A phone call from time to time...

929
01:23:20,792 --> 01:23:22,374
would make me very happy.

930
01:23:22,625 --> 01:23:24,708
- Can't you give me an address?
- No.

931
01:23:26,209 --> 01:23:28,583
Well, too bad. What can I say?

932
01:24:39,167 --> 01:24:41,416
A gentleman to see you,
Madame.

933
01:24:41,625 --> 01:24:43,124
- Me?
- Yes, Madame.

934
01:24:43,625 --> 01:24:44,916
Do you know him?

935
01:24:45,084 --> 01:24:47,874
No, Madame.
He says it's urgent.

936
01:24:57,542 --> 01:24:59,916
- Do you have the catalogue?
- Yes, Madame.

937
01:25:00,084 --> 01:25:00,916
Sit down.

938
01:25:01,084 --> 01:25:02,708
Thank you, Maria.

939
01:25:04,375 --> 01:25:06,458
Good idea, asking for a catalogue.

940
01:25:09,334 --> 01:25:10,833
Nice place you have.

941
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,249
What are you doing here?
Go away!

942
01:25:13,417 --> 01:25:17,249
When I didn't see you any more,
I thought I'd pay you a visit...

943
01:25:17,459 --> 01:25:19,458
to see how you were.

944
01:25:20,250 --> 01:25:22,583
- How did you find me?
- Child's play.

945
01:25:23,125 --> 01:25:24,708
Your husband?

946
01:25:25,125 --> 01:25:27,874
Good-looking guy! Handsome!

947
01:25:29,125 --> 01:25:30,166
Much better than me.

948
01:25:30,334 --> 01:25:33,999
- Please go away!
- Don't worry. I won't make a fuss.

949
01:25:34,959 --> 01:25:37,208
I only wanted to know
why you left.

950
01:25:37,542 --> 01:25:40,583
- You hear?
- Don't shout. The maid will hear.

951
01:25:41,042 --> 01:25:42,874
Just go. He'll be back soon.

952
01:25:43,792 --> 01:25:46,166
You're not very hospitable.

953
01:25:46,500 --> 01:25:48,374
- What do you want?
- To see you again.

954
01:25:48,542 --> 01:25:51,208
It's impossible.
I'm never going back there!

955
01:25:56,500 --> 01:25:58,291
I'll give you three days.

956
01:25:58,542 --> 01:26:00,499
Find an excuse. Anything.

957
01:26:00,750 --> 01:26:03,874
I'll meet you at the Hotel du Bois.
Rue Fromentin.

958
01:26:04,584 --> 01:26:05,874
You'll stay the night.

959
01:26:06,084 --> 01:26:07,583
It's impossible.

960
01:26:12,667 --> 01:26:15,041
Then I'll wait for him.

961
01:26:17,625 --> 01:26:19,083
I've lots to tell him.

962
01:26:19,250 --> 01:26:21,499
- You wouldn't do that!
- I would.

963
01:26:21,667 --> 01:26:24,208
I didn't want to,
but you force me to.

964
01:26:25,334 --> 01:26:27,624
After all, maybe it's for the best.

965
01:26:28,250 --> 01:26:31,124
- I'd decided to tell him all, too.
- Is that so?

966
01:26:31,292 --> 01:26:33,458
He'd have found out sooner or later.

967
01:26:33,625 --> 01:26:35,749
A friend of ours saw me there.

968
01:26:36,125 --> 01:26:37,999
Anyhow, I've had enough.

969
01:26:40,167 --> 01:26:42,291
That's fine.
Let's wait for him.

970
01:26:42,500 --> 01:26:46,249
We'll tell him everything together.
I don't mind.

971
01:26:55,792 --> 01:26:57,291
Oh please!

972
01:26:57,667 --> 01:26:59,333
Go away before he comes.

973
01:27:12,667 --> 01:27:14,166
Don't be afraid.

974
01:27:14,959 --> 01:27:16,249
I'll go.

975
01:27:17,459 --> 01:27:20,041
I didn't believe you,
but I understand now.

976
01:27:25,250 --> 01:27:27,083
There's the obstacle.

977
01:27:35,792 --> 01:27:37,166
See you soon.

978
01:28:14,417 --> 01:28:15,749
See her?

979
01:28:15,917 --> 01:28:17,624
Leave me the car.

980
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,166
- Where are you going?
- I need it.

981
01:28:20,709 --> 01:28:23,124
Leave the car and get out.

982
01:28:23,625 --> 01:28:25,291
What are you up to?

983
01:28:26,875 --> 01:28:28,624
Get out, I tell you.

984
01:28:29,375 --> 01:28:32,583
This time, kid, I've had it.

985
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,749
Hey, I won't let you run off
like that!

986
01:30:50,042 --> 01:30:51,083
Well?

987
01:30:51,250 --> 01:30:53,374
The killer's dead.
The police are baffled.

988
01:30:53,542 --> 01:30:56,083
He hit the wrong guy
or else he was mad.

989
01:30:56,250 --> 01:30:58,166
- Who was he?
- A gangster.

990
01:30:58,334 --> 01:31:01,374
- It seems he had quite a record.
- That's odd.

991
01:31:01,542 --> 01:31:03,916
- And how's Sérizy?
- It's too early to say.

992
01:31:04,084 --> 01:31:05,999
His wife's in the waiting room.

993
01:31:27,459 --> 01:31:28,958
How is he?

994
01:31:29,125 --> 01:31:32,249
Too early to say.
But he'll live.

995
01:31:32,584 --> 01:31:35,333
- May I see him?
- No. He's still in a coma.

996
01:31:35,500 --> 01:31:36,833
Tomorrow, perhaps.

997
01:31:37,084 --> 01:31:40,416
Go home and get some rest.

998
01:31:40,584 --> 01:31:43,458
We'll keep you informed
every hour, I promise.

999
01:31:45,334 --> 01:31:46,833
Don't worry.

1000
01:31:51,084 --> 01:31:53,124
Come along.
I'll go with you.

1001
01:33:01,959 --> 01:33:04,374
I've sent Marie out
for the newspapers.

1002
01:33:04,584 --> 01:33:07,166
I'll read you the articles
that interest you.

1003
01:33:09,542 --> 01:33:11,666
Marie is very kind.

1004
01:33:11,834 --> 01:33:13,541
She likes you a lot.

1005
01:33:16,667 --> 01:33:18,708
Everybody's asking about you.

1006
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:22,499
You're much better.

1007
01:33:22,667 --> 01:33:24,749
The doctor is very optimistic.

1008
01:33:25,542 --> 01:33:28,458
You don't realize it,
but you're making great progress,

1009
01:33:28,625 --> 01:33:30,416
especially your eyes.

1010
01:33:31,875 --> 01:33:35,666
It's funny. Since your... accident,

1011
01:33:35,917 --> 01:33:37,499
I've not been dreaming.

1012
01:33:39,667 --> 01:33:42,208
It's time for your medicine.

1013
01:34:09,084 --> 01:34:11,958
Monsieur Husson.
To see Monsieur Sérizy.

1014
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:19,458
I'm coming.

1015
01:34:32,209 --> 01:34:34,083
I am very sorry to disturb you.

1016
01:34:34,584 --> 01:34:36,249
You want to see Pierre?

1017
01:34:36,417 --> 01:34:38,124
Just a moment.

1018
01:34:38,542 --> 01:34:41,333
He still can't speak. He is...

1019
01:34:41,625 --> 01:34:43,208
I know.

1020
01:34:43,459 --> 01:34:44,958
Sorry I didn't come sooner.

1021
01:34:45,125 --> 01:34:48,208
You know what I think of Pierre.
I was away on a trip.

1022
01:34:48,834 --> 01:34:50,291
A pretty dress!

1023
01:34:51,500 --> 01:34:54,208
Like a precocious schoolgirl.

1024
01:34:55,834 --> 01:34:58,916
- What will you tell him?
- Everything I know about you.

1025
01:35:00,334 --> 01:35:01,749
Keep calm!

1026
01:35:02,917 --> 01:35:06,791
He's paralyzed
and feels he's a burden to you.

1027
01:35:09,167 --> 01:35:11,958
That makes him ashamed,
because he thinks you're pure.

1028
01:35:12,125 --> 01:35:14,958
That's why I want to tell him
everything.

1029
01:35:16,334 --> 01:35:19,166
It will hurt him...
but it will be for the best.

1030
01:35:22,417 --> 01:35:25,041
Who could accuse me
of being cruel?

1031
01:35:28,084 --> 01:35:29,791
Show me in, please.

1032
01:35:32,375 --> 01:35:33,833
He's through there.

1033
01:35:39,500 --> 01:35:42,124
Do you want to be present?

1034
01:38:10,375 --> 01:38:11,791
What are you thinking about?

1035
01:38:14,625 --> 01:38:16,291
About you, Pierre.

1036
01:38:17,250 --> 01:38:18,958
I'm thirsty.

1037
01:38:38,209 --> 01:38:39,624
Shall I get some ice?

1038
01:38:39,792 --> 01:38:41,499
No, don't bother.

1039
01:38:43,292 --> 01:38:46,124
I think I can take
two weeks off in February.

1040
01:38:46,292 --> 01:38:48,708
- To go to the mountains?
- If you want.

1041
01:39:01,834 --> 01:39:03,541
Do you hear that?

1042
01:39:41,625 --> 01:39:44,458
Subtitling: Télétota
