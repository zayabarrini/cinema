NAGISA OSHIMA

3
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:24,041
Awake already?

4
00:01:24,168 --> 00:01:25,752
It's so cold.

5
00:01:25,878 --> 00:01:28,087
It's too early to get up.

6
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:30,923
Let's sleep a little longer.

7
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:35,052
I couldn't sleep all night.

8
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:37,597
I know.

9
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:42,310
I had the same problem
when I started here.

10
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:46,439
You're so stylish and refined.

11
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:49,817
What are you doing
working as a serving girl?

12
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:56,574
I took a liking to you
as soon as I saw you yesterday.

13
00:01:57,868 --> 00:01:59,494
Come on...

14
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:01,788
hold me tight.

15
00:02:02,498 --> 00:02:05,291
That tickles.

16
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:10,963
You have such
a beautiful body.

17
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:15,009
Don't you like women?

18
00:02:19,515 --> 00:02:21,015
In that case...

19
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:34,088
It's the same every morning
before he goes to the fish market.

20
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:13,586
- Let's play that association game.
- I'll go first.

21
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:15,546
Hairy legs.

22
00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:18,758
Crabs.

23
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:20,760
Chastity.

24
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,887
Men.

25
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:28,392
What are you kids up to?

26
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:31,062
Stop it!
Leave the poor man alone!

27
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:33,439
What are you doing here?

28
00:04:45,077 --> 00:04:46,619
How awful!

29
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:57,546
What are you doing?

30
00:04:57,673 --> 00:05:00,132
Get out of here,
you little brats!

31
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,349
It's you!

32
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,063
- What's gotten into you?
- Osaka -

33
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:15,815
Let her go!

34
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:17,984
Keep your filthy hands off her!

35
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:27,201
I can't remember.
What was your name?

36
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:31,831
Was it in Osaka?

37
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:35,626
Nagoya? Tokyo?

38
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:40,756
You were so cheerful and kind.

39
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:43,300
I was your customer.

40
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:45,720
Don't you remember me?

41
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:47,930
I've never seen you before.

42
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:49,932
I want you now!

43
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:52,143
Look, I have money!

44
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:10,661
Please, just this once.

45
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:13,998
You just won't give up.

46
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:26,719
- You haven't changed at all.
- Hurry up.

47
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:30,056
You really don't remember me?

48
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,766
Nope.

49
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:36,854
What's wrong? It's limp.

50
00:06:41,777 --> 00:06:43,110
Are you cold?

51
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:46,447
If you just let me see your...

52
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:48,949
What a pain!

53
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,636
You'll catch cold.

54
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:12,807
You'd better just forget it.

55
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:22,858
Go on now.

56
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:24,026
Don't stand there singing!
Hurry up!

57
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:25,444
Don't stand there singing!
Hurry up!

58
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,697
Where have you been?

59
00:07:28,824 --> 00:07:32,660
Stop dawdling
and take this in right away.

60
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:36,789
You're working in a proper inn.
It's not as easy as being a whore.

61
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,792
What are you staring at?

62
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:43,045
Stop it!

63
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:45,589
- Go to hell!
- Stop it!

64
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:47,800
I said stop!

65
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:53,472
- What's all this about?
- Once a whore, always a whore!

66
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:57,810
I'll kill her!

67
00:07:57,936 --> 00:07:58,811
Stop it!

68
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:02,148
So what if I was?
You think you're better than me?

69
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,732
Stop it!

70
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:05,609
You're to blame too.

71
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:08,320
Watch what you say!
We all have to work together.

72
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,656
I expect you both to apologize!

73
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:12,616
Out of my way!

74
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:21,709
What's going on?

75
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:25,129
It's practically a brawl in here.

76
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,674
Who are you?

77
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:30,926
You new here?

78
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:34,013
What's your name?

79
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:37,099
Sada.

80
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:41,687
Sada Abe.

81
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:47,526
Lucky you came when you did.
Now I wonder just where you were.

82
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:54,825
You've got such pretty hands.

83
00:08:56,161 --> 00:09:00,539
Why hold that knife when you
could be holding something else?

84
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:15,387
What a nice view.

85
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,480
No, don't stop.
Go on working.

86
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:33,822
Don't play with fire

87
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:38,577
I like the sway of your hips.

88
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:45,459
I bet you've broken
many a man's heart.

89
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,923
I will pierce you through

90
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:53,759
How many hearts
have you broken?

91
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:06,021
Master...

92
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:14,613
You're hurting my hand.

93
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:16,282
That hurts.

94
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,200
Master...

95
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:20,411
I'm a married woman -

96
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:23,205
I've heard all about it.

97
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:27,334
Your husband's business failed.

98
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:32,006
Now you both have to work.

99
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:33,799
That's right.

100
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:35,968
Must be hard.

101
00:10:39,014 --> 00:10:40,806
You're...

102
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,559
a woman with a past,
aren't you?

103
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:49,315
I only came here because I heard
this was an upstanding house.

104
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:52,359
Is that so?
Well, as you see...

105
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:57,323
I'm an upstanding man.

106
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:10,502
Aren't you done yet?
Hurry up!

107
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:18,510
Bonds

108
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:23,974
Between friends

109
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:33,192
Can never be broken

110
00:11:33,485 --> 00:11:36,445
Master,
are you alone tonight?

111
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:39,573
I stopped drinking out,

112
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,451
so tonight
I'll be your customer.

113
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:45,120
Why did you stop drinking out?

114
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,748
So I can do this instead.

115
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:12,272
Madam sent me.
She said there was a customer.

116
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:14,650
That's me.

117
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:18,028
What is this

118
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:20,948
Narrow path

119
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:28,497
See how wet you are?

120
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:33,919
Let's not waste time.
Come on.

121
00:12:58,069 --> 00:12:59,778
That feels so good.

122
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:07,995
If you go on, I'll -

123
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,209
What if the geisha comes?

124
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,462
We'll get in trouble.

125
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:19,840
- You want me to stop?
- No!

126
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,303
It's driving me mad.

127
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:27,389
How is it driving you mad?

128
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:29,641
How?

129
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:36,815
Good evening.

130
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:39,568
Thank you for sending for me.
I'm your geisha, Yaeji.

131
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:41,695
Just a moment, please.

132
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,573
I'm a bit busy right now.

133
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,826
Please take your time.

134
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:09,348
Come in, Yaeji.

135
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:16,021
Sorry I kept you waiting.

136
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:25,364
Good evening.

137
00:14:29,244 --> 00:14:31,745
What a lovely young girl!

138
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:39,878
In the white snow...

139
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:53,767
Where are you going?

140
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,395
To the toilet.

141
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:05,571
I'll be waiting.

142
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:08,740
I don't have to go
right this minute.

143
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:13,579
They say it feels better
with a full bladder.

144
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,425
Take your time.
There's no hurry.

145
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:30,846
But Master...

146
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:34,141
last night I -

147
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:37,603
It's all right.

148
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:40,772
I want you to feel good.

149
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,941
Your pleasure is enough.

150
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:48,238
I'm holding back for you.

151
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:19,478
You're going to make love
to your wife later, aren't you?

152
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:28,153
What a slut,
having sex every morning.

153
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:36,953
So you've seen us?
Have you been watching?

154
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:40,666
I won't let you go
until you've come.

155
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,419
Don't worry about that.

156
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:47,506
Let's take our time
and enjoy it.

157
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:54,888
But it's already dawn.

158
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,932
Who cares?

159
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:51,903
You're an unusual woman.

160
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:45,749
My hair

161
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:49,294
Is out of place

162
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:53,882
Only because

163
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:56,593
Of my pillow

164
00:18:57,345 --> 00:18:59,805
Yet I know

165
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:09,981
You don't believe me...

166
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:17,531
Master, I can't play anymore.

167
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:21,368
You have to keep playing.

168
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:26,957
I told my wife you'd be playing
the shamisen for me tonight.

169
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:30,794
If you stop,
she'll get suspicious.

170
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:33,630
Why don't you sing instead?

171
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:36,967
Just a little longer.

172
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:47,143
It's my job

173
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:51,773
It's a prostitute's life

174
00:19:52,775 --> 00:19:57,362
Forgive me

175
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:02,868
The warbler in the tree
by the shed

176
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:06,538
On the second branch
from the top

177
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:10,250
Sprinkled vinegar
with grass held in her beak

178
00:20:10,501 --> 00:20:15,714
And then laid 12 eggs

179
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:17,924
The first was a nightingale

180
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,885
The second was a kingfisher

181
00:20:20,011 --> 00:20:21,887
The third was a wren

182
00:20:22,013 --> 00:20:23,722
The fourth was a night crow

183
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,891
The fifth was a woodpecker

184
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,809
The sixth was a starling

185
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:31,563
The seventh was a plover

186
00:20:31,689 --> 00:20:33,398
The eighth was a pheasant

187
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:37,068
The ninth was a robin

188
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:40,155
The tenth and eleventh...

189
00:20:51,626 --> 00:20:52,626
Excuse me, ma'am.

190
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:55,462
I'm sorry to disturb you.

191
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:57,464
Oh, hello. What is it?

192
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:02,260
I'm sorry
if this is very sudden,

193
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:06,598
but I request permission
to leave your employ.

194
00:21:07,642 --> 00:21:10,560
Well, this is quite a surprise.

195
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:13,772
We can discuss it,
but for now please change this water.

196
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:11,454
I'm very happy with your work.

197
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:21,548
And you're very well-behaved.

198
00:22:24,427 --> 00:22:29,305
There's no reason
for you to leave us.

199
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:42,360
- Oh no.
- What is it?

200
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:44,571
I just got my period.

201
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,662
I don't mind.

202
00:23:16,604 --> 00:23:19,355
Good morning.
Your guests have arrived.

203
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:25,236
This is the first time
you'll see me completely naked.

204
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:28,031
Are you happy?

205
00:23:28,157 --> 00:23:30,033
Yes...

206
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:33,661
but the man
should undress first.

207
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:37,248
No, let me undress you first.

208
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,680
Your skin's so youthful.

209
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,391
It's practically glowing.

210
00:23:56,185 --> 00:23:58,269
You're utterly radiant.

211
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:04,400
Skin like this could suck
the blood right out of a man.

212
00:24:05,528 --> 00:24:07,487
You can't be serious.

213
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:09,614
You're the one
who devours women.

214
00:24:11,325 --> 00:24:15,620
I'm old. I want your youth
to rub off on me.

215
00:24:26,757 --> 00:24:30,385
Your skin's so soft.

216
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:33,721
I feel like sucking on it.

217
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,557
Silly.

218
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:40,562
I've brought your sake, sir.

219
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:45,775
Master, didn't you say
you'd stopped drinking out?

220
00:24:47,528 --> 00:24:49,654
This isn't out.

221
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:53,658
This is our home -
yours and mine.

222
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:56,786
I'm so happy
to hear you say that.

223
00:24:58,205 --> 00:25:02,292
How auspicious

224
00:25:02,543 --> 00:25:06,462
How auspicious

225
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:12,844
Young pine

226
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:17,849
Show us tonight

227
00:25:18,142 --> 00:25:20,018
Congratulations!

228
00:25:22,897 --> 00:25:30,737
How your branches flourish

229
00:25:30,988 --> 00:25:37,076
And your leaves grow thick

230
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:42,624
How auspicious

231
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:49,631
Your leaves grow thick

232
00:25:50,925 --> 00:25:53,843
What do I do with this?

233
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:56,346
Don't you know?

234
00:25:56,472 --> 00:26:00,058
I never had
a proper wedding before.

235
00:26:00,184 --> 00:26:04,729
If my bride had already
been properly wed,

236
00:26:04,855 --> 00:26:07,065
that would be quite a letdown.

237
00:26:08,317 --> 00:26:11,986
Indeed, tonight is our wedding.

238
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:15,031
So please rejoice with us,
all of you.

239
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:24,624
Keep playing

240
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:27,252
Let the music play

241
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:34,133
After the nuptial cups
comes the bridal bed.

242
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,636
Yes, they must consummate
their marriage.

243
00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:38,846
It's already been consummated.

244
00:26:38,973 --> 00:26:40,932
That was underhanded!

245
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:44,560
You may have had her before,
but on your wedding night,

246
00:26:44,687 --> 00:26:46,437
she'll be especially delicious.

247
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:48,106
Is that right?

248
00:26:49,275 --> 00:26:50,525
Really?

249
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:57,615
Shall we?

250
00:26:58,534 --> 00:27:00,618
Yes, Master.

251
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:02,954
Stop calling me "master."

252
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,623
Call me Kichi-san from now on.

253
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:10,712
Of course... Kichi-san.

254
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:14,132
Sada.

255
00:27:19,555 --> 00:27:23,891
Have the plums blossomed

256
00:27:25,227 --> 00:27:28,646
What's this?
You're trembling.

257
00:27:29,815 --> 00:27:31,649
What's the matter?

258
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:37,238
I don't know.
I'm shaking all over.

259
00:27:41,744 --> 00:27:43,369
If you'll excuse us...

260
00:28:03,057 --> 00:28:05,391
You seem awfully interested.

261
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:08,853
Come take a closer look.

262
00:28:08,979 --> 00:28:11,105
No, let me go!

263
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:14,609
Come now.
Surely you've seen it before.

264
00:28:14,735 --> 00:28:17,195
No, don't close your eyes.

265
00:28:17,363 --> 00:28:18,988
Look!

266
00:28:23,327 --> 00:28:25,453
Don't moan
with pleasure like that!

267
00:28:29,083 --> 00:28:32,835
It's not pleasure.
It's pain.

268
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:34,921
Kosome, it's your turn.

269
00:29:16,213 --> 00:29:17,755
It hurts!

270
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:25,346
In Kitahama

271
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:34,647
He came out

272
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:41,821
Into the cool of the evening

273
00:29:46,452 --> 00:29:52,039
A breeze from the river

274
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:56,294
Suddenly blew

275
00:29:56,545 --> 00:30:01,924
Through the peonies

276
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:10,641
He's a wild

277
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:16,147
And untamed lover

278
00:30:16,482 --> 00:30:22,653
Stay with us

279
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:27,867
Always

280
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:33,122
Kichi-san, where are you going

281
00:30:33,916 --> 00:30:38,002
To harvest the rice
in the fields

282
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:44,383
Take me with you

283
00:30:45,719 --> 00:30:50,056
You'll only get in my way

284
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:59,232
You wretched little monk!

285
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:02,860
May I make the bed now?

286
00:31:05,531 --> 00:31:07,865
Give us a little longer.

287
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:11,452
What time is it?

288
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:13,412
It's already noon.

289
00:31:13,622 --> 00:31:14,956
Really?

290
00:31:18,043 --> 00:31:19,544
Kichi-san.

291
00:31:21,797 --> 00:31:25,633
Kichi-san, it's noon already.

292
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:34,225
Good morning.

293
00:31:39,273 --> 00:31:42,358
Did you hold it all night?

294
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:44,652
Yes.

295
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:47,905
Couldn't you sleep?

296
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:50,950
I wasn't sleepy.

297
00:31:51,535 --> 00:31:53,244
I was too happy.

298
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:54,870
Really?

299
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:56,831
You're so young.

300
00:31:56,957 --> 00:32:00,001
How can you look
so fresh and lovely without sleep?

301
00:32:00,127 --> 00:32:02,169
You're radiant!

302
00:32:05,007 --> 00:32:08,426
I'm glad you're raring to go,
but give me a minute, okay?

303
00:32:08,552 --> 00:32:11,512
- Where are you going?
- To pee.

304
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:14,056
Why not do it here?

305
00:32:14,808 --> 00:32:16,225
Where?

306
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:19,812
Inside me.

307
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:21,272
You're crazy.

308
00:32:21,398 --> 00:32:25,109
I can't do both
at the same time.

309
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:27,695
Let's try and see.

310
00:32:29,615 --> 00:32:32,450
Can't you just wait
while I pee?

311
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:36,621
I've been waiting so long.

312
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:41,292
I see. Very well.

313
00:32:54,431 --> 00:32:57,767
Are you ever not wet?

314
00:32:58,226 --> 00:33:00,353
It's not like
I'm sick or something.

315
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:02,938
I know.

316
00:33:04,608 --> 00:33:06,317
You're adorable.

317
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:14,283
I was a little worried once,

318
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:17,620
so I went to see a doctor.

319
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:20,289
He said...

320
00:33:20,624 --> 00:33:24,085
I'm acutely sensitive.

321
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:26,504
Acutely sensitive?

322
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,632
Those are big words.

323
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:35,179
In any case, I love the fact
you're acutely sensitive.

324
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:59,036
Kichi-san...

325
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:01,956
put it in me now.

326
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:04,750
Not yet.

327
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:09,547
I said put it in.

328
00:34:47,669 --> 00:34:49,545
What's so funny?

329
00:34:50,172 --> 00:34:53,716
I was thinking
that the only time

330
00:34:53,842 --> 00:34:58,637
my dick can rest
is when I take a piss.

331
00:34:59,306 --> 00:35:01,265
That's right.

332
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:17,531
But after you're done,

333
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:20,451
you sure get hard again fast.

334
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:35,174
See?

335
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:38,052
Just like I said.

336
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:44,475
You're right.
It practically belongs to you.

337
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:46,519
It does belong to me.

338
00:35:48,021 --> 00:35:49,647
Tell me...

339
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:55,820
why does it get hard
so quickly?

340
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:00,032
Because...

341
00:36:02,077 --> 00:36:04,829
it knows you want it.

342
00:36:08,208 --> 00:36:11,168
I want it again now.

343
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:21,387
People can see us.

344
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:23,514
I don't care.

345
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:34,441
You sure are full of spunk,
granny.

346
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:37,361
I am with you two around!

347
00:36:52,127 --> 00:36:53,919
Let's say good-bye here.

348
00:36:54,421 --> 00:36:56,922
No. I'll walk you home.

349
00:36:59,718 --> 00:37:02,887
Leave it alone.
It hurts when I walk.

350
00:37:30,582 --> 00:37:32,750
What if the servants see us?

351
00:37:33,335 --> 00:37:35,336
It's hard again.

352
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:39,173
That's because you're holding it.
Let go.

353
00:37:39,299 --> 00:37:43,469
No, you have to take me
right here and now.

354
00:37:54,022 --> 00:37:56,357
Pardon me,
but I've brought your sake.

355
00:37:56,775 --> 00:37:58,275
Come in.

356
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:04,949
How unusual!
You're not in bed together.

357
00:38:08,954 --> 00:38:12,623
I can't get my young girls
to come in here.

358
00:38:13,959 --> 00:38:15,376
Why's that?

359
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:19,338
You're always
in the middle of -

360
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:21,090
Of what?

361
00:38:22,759 --> 00:38:25,469
Of me sucking your pee-pee.

362
00:38:35,188 --> 00:38:39,775
Ma'am, I have
to leave for a while,

363
00:38:39,901 --> 00:38:42,194
but I'll be back
tomorrow evening.

364
00:38:42,946 --> 00:38:47,908
Please keep an eye on him
so he doesn't go out.

365
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:50,160
You can count on me.

366
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:53,580
But what about geisha
coming here?

367
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:56,041
That's fine.

368
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:58,377
Really? Why?

369
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:13,183
Well? Do I look pretty?

370
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:20,024
You've lost weight.
Makes you even lovelier.

371
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:26,613
Oh, dear!

372
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:36,331
Kichi-san, you're still not tired?

373
00:39:39,127 --> 00:39:42,129
It's cruel to tempt
a woman my age with such a sight.

374
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:55,434
I know we need the money,

375
00:39:55,560 --> 00:40:00,230
but I get mad with jealousy
when I imagine you with another man.

376
00:40:00,774 --> 00:40:05,903
Are you really jealous?
That makes me happy.

377
00:40:06,905 --> 00:40:11,325
But he's just a school principal
and town alderman.

378
00:40:11,451 --> 00:40:14,536
Very upstanding.

379
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:18,082
You like 'em upstanding,
don't you?

380
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:20,918
I really do.

381
00:40:52,117 --> 00:40:57,704
Kichi-san, I'm taking
your kimono with me.

382
00:40:57,914 --> 00:40:59,248
Why?

383
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:04,461
To make sure
you don't go home.

384
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:09,466
Am I supposed
to go around naked?

385
00:41:12,137 --> 00:41:14,888
I'll lend you my robe.

386
00:41:17,267 --> 00:41:19,143
Try it on.

387
00:41:19,352 --> 00:41:20,894
All right.

388
00:41:24,649 --> 00:41:25,732
Well?

389
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:16,033
More sake, sir?

390
00:42:19,287 --> 00:42:21,205
Shall I pour more, sir?

391
00:42:27,212 --> 00:42:30,797
It isn't healthy
to eat so little.

392
00:42:30,924 --> 00:42:33,717
The two of you never eat.

393
00:42:36,054 --> 00:42:41,016
Sir, why don't you run away
before she gets back?

394
00:42:42,143 --> 00:42:45,687
If you stay,
she'll end up killing you.

395
00:42:47,148 --> 00:42:48,815
What are you doing?

396
00:43:16,261 --> 00:43:19,930
Master, do you mind
hurrying it up?

397
00:43:20,056 --> 00:43:23,433
It's hard for me
in the afternoon.

398
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:25,769
I said we didn't have
to do this.

399
00:43:25,937 --> 00:43:28,730
But I want to.

400
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:31,984
I was up all night
waiting for this.

401
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:34,820
I see you have yet
to mend your ways.

402
00:43:34,946 --> 00:43:39,366
You promised to try
to sleep alone.

403
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:42,202
It's different with you,

404
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:47,499
because I like
and respect you.

405
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:49,876
You understand, don't you?

406
00:43:56,759 --> 00:43:58,969
Sir, beat me!

407
00:44:00,388 --> 00:44:01,596
Slap me!

408
00:44:01,723 --> 00:44:03,181
- Sada!
- Slap me!

409
00:44:05,393 --> 00:44:06,852
Harder!

410
00:44:07,687 --> 00:44:09,021
Harder!

411
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:14,151
Now pinch me!

412
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:18,322
Don't stop!

413
00:44:18,948 --> 00:44:20,699
Harder!

414
00:44:21,826 --> 00:44:24,745
Now pull my hair!

415
00:44:28,541 --> 00:44:30,375
Harder!

416
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:34,129
Harder!

417
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:37,257
More!

418
00:44:38,885 --> 00:44:41,511
Harder!

419
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:43,221
But Sada...

420
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:29,226
Kichi-san!

421
00:45:34,399 --> 00:45:36,066
How have you been?

422
00:45:37,402 --> 00:45:39,653
- I've got money.
- Really?

423
00:45:39,779 --> 00:45:41,696
Let's go spend it.

424
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:54,835
I missed you so much.

425
00:45:57,046 --> 00:46:00,257
I'll never leave
your side again.

426
00:46:05,555 --> 00:46:09,933
Kichi-san,
can I put it in me again?

427
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:12,102
If you want.

428
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:16,606
You're so restless -
putting it in, taking it out.

429
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:23,280
That's good.

430
00:46:23,948 --> 00:46:25,699
Just like that.

431
00:46:26,451 --> 00:46:27,951
Really?

432
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:36,042
You look so happy,

433
00:46:36,419 --> 00:46:38,920
like a 16-year-old girl.

434
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:46,845
Watching your thing
go in and out of me

435
00:46:47,305 --> 00:46:49,890
makes me feel so good.

436
00:46:55,688 --> 00:46:57,397
It feels so good.

437
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:01,276
It feels so good.

438
00:47:41,067 --> 00:47:42,984
It feels so good.

439
00:47:43,986 --> 00:47:46,196
I feel like I'm drunk.

440
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,034
Kichi-san...

441
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:54,120
stay just like that.

442
00:48:03,548 --> 00:48:05,006
Sada...

443
00:48:05,633 --> 00:48:08,718
how was it
with your school principal?

444
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:14,224
Show me exactly
what you did.

445
00:48:19,188 --> 00:48:20,855
That tickles.

446
00:48:22,233 --> 00:48:24,484
Well, that's what I did.

447
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:26,695
To your principal?

448
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:37,747
"Sada, I just want you to think
seriously about your future."

449
00:48:46,507 --> 00:48:49,884
What about in this department?

450
00:48:50,219 --> 00:48:51,928
That?

451
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:54,681
He couldn't get hard at all.

452
00:48:54,974 --> 00:48:57,017
So what did you do?

453
00:48:58,436 --> 00:49:00,270
Don't get mad.

454
00:49:01,147 --> 00:49:05,942
I suddenly thought of you
and went into hysterics.

455
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:10,447
I don't know why...

456
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:15,493
but I asked him to slap me.

457
00:49:15,828 --> 00:49:19,247
And what did
your principal do?

458
00:49:26,839 --> 00:49:28,673
Slap me.

459
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:33,637
I'm sorry.

460
00:49:34,096 --> 00:49:35,639
Harder.

461
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:40,226
Harder.

462
00:49:41,687 --> 00:49:43,271
Harder!

463
00:49:47,652 --> 00:49:49,277
Harder!

464
00:49:53,574 --> 00:49:56,159
Harder!

465
00:50:29,568 --> 00:50:39,536
Come and look

466
00:50:41,414 --> 00:50:44,708
In the snow

467
00:50:46,711 --> 00:50:52,090
Even the birds

468
00:50:52,717 --> 00:50:57,595
Stay tucked in their nests

469
00:51:08,733 --> 00:51:13,111
They say true love means eating
food dipped in your lover's juices.

470
00:51:26,292 --> 00:51:28,126
It's delicious.

471
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:36,176
Sada...

472
00:51:36,552 --> 00:51:43,224
I'll do whatever it takes
to make you happy.

473
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:56,029
That's delicious too.

474
00:51:56,697 --> 00:51:59,324
And now...

475
00:52:02,286 --> 00:52:03,953
let's try this.

476
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:14,464
A woman's pussy
is her capital city

477
00:52:14,757 --> 00:52:19,719
Guarded by the pubic hair
lined up all around it

478
00:52:20,179 --> 00:52:22,722
Kichi-san, take it out!

479
00:52:23,098 --> 00:52:25,725
Take it out! Hurry!

480
00:52:25,851 --> 00:52:29,312
How can I
when you're sitting like that?

481
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:31,981
How does a hen lay an egg?

482
00:52:32,107 --> 00:52:33,650
Like this?

483
00:52:34,819 --> 00:52:36,319
That's right.

484
00:52:36,445 --> 00:52:39,989
If you strain too hard, you'll crush it.
Slowly and gently.

485
00:52:40,866 --> 00:52:45,829
Fighting like cats and dogs...

486
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:48,581
- That's it.
- That wasn't nice!

487
00:52:50,835 --> 00:52:53,503
Sada, we're not alone.

488
00:52:53,629 --> 00:52:55,421
I don't care.

489
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:03,096
- What's that for?
- To cut it off.

490
00:53:03,764 --> 00:53:05,098
You're crazy.

491
00:53:05,558 --> 00:53:08,184
So you can't use it at home.

492
00:53:08,352 --> 00:53:10,687
I already told you
I wouldn't.

493
00:53:11,230 --> 00:53:14,899
Well, you might.
That's why I'll cut it off.

494
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:17,902
Then you won't be able
to use it either.

495
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:23,449
That's why
I'll mount you like this

496
00:53:23,576 --> 00:53:26,452
and cut it off inside me.

497
00:53:27,288 --> 00:53:30,290
All right. Go ahead.

498
00:53:32,334 --> 00:53:33,877
It feels good.

499
00:53:34,837 --> 00:53:38,631
If I cut it off,
do you think you'd die?

500
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:41,134
Probably.

501
00:53:41,594 --> 00:53:43,678
I don't want you to.

502
00:53:46,891 --> 00:53:48,933
Don't worry. I won't.

503
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:52,729
I promised to stay with you
forever, didn't I?

504
00:53:52,855 --> 00:53:56,232
I'll set you up in a small inn.

505
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,027
I don't want
to be your mistress.

506
00:53:59,153 --> 00:54:01,946
I don't want to share you
with your wife.

507
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:04,991
We have to be together
all the time.

508
00:54:06,911 --> 00:54:10,079
Listen, Sada,
if we lived together,

509
00:54:10,205 --> 00:54:12,874
I'd be reduced to a skeleton.

510
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:17,003
So you don't want
to live together, is that it?

511
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:23,801
Fine. I'll live with you,
even if I become a skeleton.

512
00:54:23,928 --> 00:54:29,599
You sure?
Even worn down to a skeleton?

513
00:54:30,225 --> 00:54:31,726
I'm sure.

514
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:37,190
Now could you stop
threatening me with this?

515
00:54:37,316 --> 00:54:38,858
It's dangerous.

516
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:54,999
Now you'll grow a beard.

517
00:55:00,798 --> 00:55:05,134
Are you going to make love
to your wife again?

518
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:07,136
No.

519
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:09,472
Say you'll never do it again.

520
00:55:09,765 --> 00:55:11,474
I'll never do it again.

521
00:55:11,684 --> 00:55:14,560
"You can kill me
if I ever make love to her."

522
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:17,772
You can kill me
if I ever make love to her.

523
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:22,819
Kichi!

524
00:55:49,346 --> 00:55:52,515
- Shall we scare her?
- All right.

525
00:55:54,643 --> 00:55:56,519
I'm a ghost!

526
00:55:57,187 --> 00:55:59,605
- I'm the haunted parasol!
- I have one eye!

527
00:55:59,732 --> 00:56:01,899
And four legs!

528
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:08,489
Why don't you
make love to her?

529
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:11,200
She's not my type.

530
00:56:28,844 --> 00:56:32,430
I'm sorry,
but it's closing time.

531
00:56:35,768 --> 00:56:38,394
Old man,
you want to do it?

532
00:56:39,104 --> 00:56:43,775
You can have me
if you let us drink some more.

533
00:56:45,527 --> 00:56:49,447
Mine's only good
for peeing these days.

534
00:57:00,292 --> 00:57:04,045
Kichi,
don't ever leave me!

535
00:57:23,607 --> 00:57:25,525
I caught a little goblin.

536
00:57:31,865 --> 00:57:33,991
Now it's your turn.
Come here.

537
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:35,910
No.

538
00:57:36,036 --> 00:57:37,787
Then I'll come get you.

539
00:57:59,726 --> 00:58:02,145
Ouch! That hurts!

540
00:58:03,397 --> 00:58:06,274
That hurts.

541
00:58:29,590 --> 00:58:32,300
Could that have been
a burglar, dear?

542
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:34,385
Don't be silly.

543
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:36,888
A burglar wouldn't make
all that noise.

544
00:58:38,307 --> 00:58:40,766
Probably just some drunk.

545
00:58:41,476 --> 00:58:43,853
We can clean it up tomorrow.

546
00:58:50,027 --> 00:58:52,028
Do you think...

547
00:58:52,404 --> 00:58:54,363
it could have been her?

548
00:58:57,659 --> 00:58:59,493
Go to sleep.

549
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:20,890
Going back to her?

550
00:59:24,061 --> 00:59:27,730
You startled me,
appearing out of nowhere like that.

551
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:36,864
It's all right.

552
00:59:43,455 --> 00:59:51,045
Come and look

553
00:59:52,214 --> 00:59:55,424
In this snow

554
00:59:59,263 --> 01:00:01,639
Even the birds

555
01:00:02,015 --> 01:00:07,728
Stay tucked in their nests

556
01:00:13,151 --> 01:00:16,529
Lying in bed

557
01:00:21,285 --> 01:00:24,578
I open the lattice window

558
01:00:27,499 --> 01:00:31,711
With my pipe

559
01:00:41,054 --> 01:00:49,186
Come and look

560
01:01:05,454 --> 01:01:07,955
Master, you're wanted
on the phone.

561
01:01:08,707 --> 01:01:10,416
No!

562
01:01:10,542 --> 01:01:12,126
Get off me!

563
01:01:27,642 --> 01:01:28,976
Hello!

564
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:31,520
Welcome.

565
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:35,524
Damn you!

566
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:41,364
Damn you, Kichi!

567
01:01:41,907 --> 01:01:45,534
Tell me the truth!
You fucked her, didn't you?

568
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:50,498
If you want a reverse grip,
you'll need a thicker blade.

569
01:01:50,624 --> 01:01:52,917
You can't kill anyone like that.

570
01:01:53,043 --> 01:01:55,836
I meant to buy
a thicker blade.

571
01:01:55,962 --> 01:01:59,173
Then how'd you end up
with a carving knife?

572
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:02,051
There were people watching.

573
01:02:03,387 --> 01:02:06,055
You're crazy!

574
01:02:06,473 --> 01:02:09,392
How would anyone guess
what you wanted it for?

575
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:13,104
This is all
you ever think about.

576
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:15,189
Son of a bitch!

577
01:02:15,315 --> 01:02:19,110
You think I'm crazy because
I can't stop thinking about you?

578
01:02:20,946 --> 01:02:23,322
Take off your clothes!

579
01:02:23,615 --> 01:02:25,825
Wearing a kimono like this!

580
01:02:26,326 --> 01:02:28,119
Take it off or -

581
01:02:28,245 --> 01:02:30,121
Wait a minute.

582
01:02:30,247 --> 01:02:33,082
I can't take it off like this.

583
01:02:33,667 --> 01:02:36,502
Help me, will you?

584
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:46,095
Tell me:

585
01:02:48,557 --> 01:02:51,100
What did you do
in bed with your wife?

586
01:02:54,271 --> 01:02:57,648
Look, he's shaking his head:
"I didn't do anything."

587
01:02:57,774 --> 01:02:58,941
Apologize.

588
01:02:59,067 --> 01:03:02,987
"I have no reason
to apologize."

589
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:05,739
See?
- Bastard.

590
01:03:05,866 --> 01:03:09,118
He's a stubborn one.
I'll teach him a lesson.

591
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:11,036
Please do.

592
01:03:11,163 --> 01:03:13,289
Give him a good punishing.

593
01:03:49,493 --> 01:03:50,993
Ouch!

594
01:03:51,411 --> 01:03:53,996
- Does that hurt?
- It sure does.

595
01:03:56,666 --> 01:03:58,918
- What about that?
- Yes.

596
01:03:59,377 --> 01:04:01,754
Does it hurt
but feel good too?

597
01:04:02,130 --> 01:04:03,964
It hurts
but feels good too.

598
01:04:04,090 --> 01:04:06,133
Say, "Bite me harder."

599
01:04:06,259 --> 01:04:07,927
Bite me harder.

600
01:04:09,763 --> 01:04:12,723
- Does this feel good too?
- Yes.

601
01:04:14,142 --> 01:04:19,396
Fuck me harder!

602
01:04:29,658 --> 01:04:31,367
You like this?

603
01:04:32,077 --> 01:04:33,577
Yes.

604
01:04:34,621 --> 01:04:38,332
I'll do whatever you want.

605
01:04:39,417 --> 01:04:42,545
Forgive me for leaving you alone
these past three days.

606
01:04:43,547 --> 01:04:46,423
I thought I'd go mad!

607
01:04:46,550 --> 01:04:48,217
I'm sorry.

608
01:04:55,183 --> 01:04:57,810
Are you crying?

609
01:04:58,311 --> 01:04:59,853
Only because I'm happy.

610
01:04:59,980 --> 01:05:01,397
Look at me.

611
01:05:01,523 --> 01:05:04,733
I've never seen you cry before.
Let me see.

612
01:05:04,859 --> 01:05:07,152
- No!
- It's all right.

613
01:05:09,239 --> 01:05:12,408
Your tears are salty.

614
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:15,661
Damn you for making me
so happy.

615
01:05:16,454 --> 01:05:18,622
You're awful!

616
01:05:24,296 --> 01:05:27,256
- May I bring in your sake?
- Yes.

617
01:05:31,428 --> 01:05:35,973
Bring it over here.
We're fused together.

618
01:05:38,685 --> 01:05:41,729
- Don't you want anything to eat?
- No.

619
01:05:42,147 --> 01:05:45,232
A full stomach
makes you sleepy.

620
01:05:47,444 --> 01:05:49,903
Shall I clean up
the room a bit?

621
01:05:50,363 --> 01:05:52,323
There's a strange smell.

622
01:05:52,449 --> 01:05:54,908
We like that smell...

623
01:05:55,243 --> 01:05:56,869
don't we?

624
01:06:05,795 --> 01:06:10,007
Kichi,
don't fall asleep on me.

625
01:06:12,802 --> 01:06:17,514
I've heard it feels good
to choke each other

626
01:06:17,641 --> 01:06:19,642
when you're making love.

627
01:06:22,604 --> 01:06:25,939
When you clutched
my throat the other day,

628
01:06:26,650 --> 01:06:28,192
it felt really good.

629
01:06:28,318 --> 01:06:29,985
Really?

630
01:06:30,862 --> 01:06:33,572
Okay, then choke me.

631
01:06:33,698 --> 01:06:35,199
All right.

632
01:06:41,748 --> 01:06:43,499
Here goes.

633
01:06:45,543 --> 01:06:48,962
As you tighten up here,
you'll tighten down there too.

634
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:53,801
Am I hurting you?
- I'm fine.

635
01:06:54,928 --> 01:06:56,845
Squeeze tighter.

636
01:06:58,056 --> 01:07:00,182
How's that?

637
01:07:12,445 --> 01:07:13,862
What's wrong?

638
01:07:14,531 --> 01:07:16,949
Your face is beet-red.

639
01:07:17,367 --> 01:07:19,284
It's nothing.

640
01:07:19,494 --> 01:07:21,662
Squeeze harder.

641
01:07:21,788 --> 01:07:24,915
You sure?
It's gonna hurt.

642
01:07:25,041 --> 01:07:27,209
Don't get mad, okay?

643
01:07:37,178 --> 01:07:38,971
How's it feel?

644
01:07:42,267 --> 01:07:43,600
Good?

645
01:07:47,564 --> 01:07:51,900
I guess you have to approach death
to feel the height of ecstasy.

646
01:07:52,819 --> 01:07:56,572
Did you enjoy it?
- Not at all.

647
01:07:56,990 --> 01:07:59,742
You have to squeeze hard.

648
01:08:00,577 --> 01:08:05,038
I've had enough.
I don't like watching you suffer.

649
01:08:05,248 --> 01:08:08,709
Then let me try it on you.

650
01:08:16,426 --> 01:08:18,427
Shall I?

651
01:08:21,264 --> 01:08:22,806
Go ahead.

652
01:08:27,937 --> 01:08:29,688
You're tickling me.

653
01:08:29,814 --> 01:08:31,356
You scared?

654
01:08:31,566 --> 01:08:34,109
Not at all.
Go ahead.

655
01:08:40,492 --> 01:08:43,702
Your thing
just jerked inside me.

656
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:53,837
It keeps on twitching.

657
01:08:56,466 --> 01:08:58,467
I can't breathe.

658
01:08:59,469 --> 01:09:01,970
Go slow, okay?

659
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:07,100
All right.

660
01:09:18,822 --> 01:09:20,989
It feels so good.

661
01:09:23,326 --> 01:09:26,537
I can't stand it.
- Does it feel good?

662
01:09:30,041 --> 01:09:34,127
- I feel it twitching.
- Feel good?

663
01:09:37,465 --> 01:09:38,966
Yes.

664
01:09:49,936 --> 01:09:52,312
I can't stand it...

665
01:10:02,615 --> 01:10:05,033
It's moving around.

666
01:10:20,884 --> 01:10:23,051
I can't breathe.

667
01:10:32,562 --> 01:10:35,731
- The geisha won't come in here.
- Why?

668
01:10:35,899 --> 01:10:37,774
Because of your reputation.

669
01:10:37,901 --> 01:10:41,278
What? What are they
saying about us?

670
01:10:41,404 --> 01:10:43,906
- That you're perverts.
- What?

671
01:10:46,409 --> 01:10:48,702
Who cares
what they say, Sada?

672
01:10:48,912 --> 01:10:52,039
I care.
Why are we perverts?

673
01:10:52,248 --> 01:10:55,751
You're constantly
sucking on his thing.

674
01:10:55,919 --> 01:10:58,420
What's perverted about that?

675
01:10:58,546 --> 01:11:02,633
Why shouldn't a woman
adore her lover's body?

676
01:11:03,134 --> 01:11:05,761
Come back here!
- Let her be.

677
01:11:05,929 --> 01:11:08,764
- Who's talking about us?
- Everyone.

678
01:11:08,890 --> 01:11:12,392
Everyone?
You mean you, don't you?

679
01:11:12,852 --> 01:11:17,272
What do you think about us?
Tell me, damn it!

680
01:11:24,948 --> 01:11:26,281
Sada, stop it!

681
01:11:28,743 --> 01:11:31,828
That's enough now.

682
01:11:31,955 --> 01:11:33,956
Leave the poor girl alone.

683
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:39,252
Look, Sada...

684
01:11:39,754 --> 01:11:41,838
who cares if people
call us perverts?

685
01:11:44,092 --> 01:11:47,010
I want you to fuck her.

686
01:11:47,136 --> 01:11:50,097
Master, please don't.
I'll never be able to marry.

687
01:11:52,850 --> 01:11:54,393
Get out.

688
01:11:54,519 --> 01:11:57,145
He's too good for you anyway.

689
01:12:00,233 --> 01:12:02,609
Good evening.
My name is Kikuryo.

690
01:12:02,735 --> 01:12:05,445
- Your geisha has arrived.
- Thank you.

691
01:12:09,659 --> 01:12:13,996
My, you certainly
are a virile gentleman!

692
01:12:14,497 --> 01:12:16,123
What shall I play?

693
01:12:16,249 --> 01:12:19,626
Anything.
Just play with spirit.

694
01:12:22,922 --> 01:12:28,969
You treat me

695
01:12:29,846 --> 01:12:38,145
So hatefully

696
01:12:39,564 --> 01:12:44,609
Yet I cannot help
loving you

697
01:12:45,319 --> 01:12:48,864
Do I seem like
a pervert to you?

698
01:12:48,990 --> 01:12:50,657
Why do you ask?

699
01:12:50,783 --> 01:12:55,579
I can't get enough
of his body.

700
01:12:55,705 --> 01:12:59,624
That's natural for a woman.

701
01:12:59,876 --> 01:13:01,918
How old are you?

702
01:13:02,045 --> 01:13:04,880
I'm 68.

703
01:13:05,339 --> 01:13:09,634
Do you find him attractive?

704
01:13:09,761 --> 01:13:13,180
Oh yes, he's very charming.

705
01:13:13,306 --> 01:13:16,516
So you don't mind
watching us do this?

706
01:13:16,851 --> 01:13:19,478
It's a feast for the eyes.

707
01:13:19,937 --> 01:13:21,730
Would you...

708
01:13:22,732 --> 01:13:25,442
like him to make love to you?

709
01:13:44,587 --> 01:13:47,923
Ma'am, it feels so young.

710
01:16:32,088 --> 01:16:34,089
What's that?

711
01:16:39,470 --> 01:16:42,222
Granny pissed herself.

712
01:16:42,348 --> 01:16:44,266
What a mess.

713
01:16:44,433 --> 01:16:47,102
I hope she's not dead.

714
01:16:49,105 --> 01:16:51,439
You look all pale...

715
01:16:52,066 --> 01:16:54,192
like a corpse.

716
01:16:54,527 --> 01:16:56,903
Don't say that.
It could bring bad luck.

717
01:16:57,029 --> 01:16:58,780
It was awful.

718
01:16:58,948 --> 01:17:02,200
I felt like I was having sex
with my dead mother.

719
01:17:02,952 --> 01:17:05,078
Your mother died?

720
01:17:05,204 --> 01:17:08,581
Yes, when I was a child.
Yours?

721
01:17:08,708 --> 01:17:10,583
Three years ago.

722
01:17:10,710 --> 01:17:12,794
I wasn't there when she died.

723
01:17:13,462 --> 01:17:15,964
The next year,
I spent ten days

724
01:17:16,090 --> 01:17:18,967
taking care of my father
as he was dying.

725
01:17:19,093 --> 01:17:21,428
Once you're dead, that's it.

726
01:17:27,476 --> 01:17:30,186
- Sada.
- What?

727
01:17:32,481 --> 01:17:34,816
Let's be happy
together forever.

728
01:17:52,251 --> 01:17:56,171
Let's say good-bye here.
I must say...

729
01:17:56,339 --> 01:17:59,883
you don't smell
very good today.

730
01:18:00,009 --> 01:18:02,719
Like a dead rat
or something.

731
01:18:06,515 --> 01:18:12,062
Master, could we go away
to the hot springs for a week?

732
01:18:12,188 --> 01:18:13,563
Impossible!

733
01:18:13,689 --> 01:18:17,317
If anyone knew about us,
I'd have to shoot myself.

734
01:19:27,763 --> 01:19:31,099
What's wrong?
Why are you back so soon?

735
01:19:31,225 --> 01:19:33,893
Kichi, where did you go?

736
01:19:34,019 --> 01:19:37,939
You weren't here,
so they cleaned the room!

737
01:19:38,649 --> 01:19:43,319
I went for a haircut.
I didn't think you'd be back so soon.

738
01:19:43,446 --> 01:19:46,448
What? You bastard!

739
01:19:46,615 --> 01:19:49,200
How dare you go for a haircut

740
01:19:49,326 --> 01:19:51,619
while I'm out
earning your keep!

741
01:19:51,745 --> 01:19:53,163
Forgive me.

742
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:59,335
But you said you love
my neck when it's shaved.

743
01:20:00,838 --> 01:20:04,757
I love it so much
I want to slice it open.

744
01:20:09,513 --> 01:20:11,598
Please don't.

745
01:20:12,433 --> 01:20:15,101
Strangling me should suffice.

746
01:20:17,938 --> 01:20:20,482
Perhaps that's just what I'll do.

747
01:20:55,768 --> 01:20:59,354
Sada, that's dangerous.

748
01:21:05,486 --> 01:21:07,862
Want me to strangle you?

749
01:21:09,907 --> 01:21:12,450
No, but if it
gives you pleasure -

750
01:21:14,828 --> 01:21:17,038
Say, "I want you to strangle me."

751
01:21:17,873 --> 01:21:20,124
I want you to strangle me.

752
01:21:21,710 --> 01:21:22,710
All right.

753
01:21:27,216 --> 01:21:29,384
Don't pull too hard.

754
01:21:31,262 --> 01:21:33,263
Are you afraid?

755
01:21:33,681 --> 01:21:35,390
Yes.

756
01:21:37,059 --> 01:21:38,768
You say that...

757
01:21:40,187 --> 01:21:42,939
but you're actually happy,
aren't you?

758
01:22:16,140 --> 01:22:17,932
I'm going to strangle you.

759
01:23:33,384 --> 01:23:34,759
Pull tighter.

760
01:23:40,557 --> 01:23:42,183
You can pull tighter.

761
01:23:51,860 --> 01:23:53,986
Is it twitching?

762
01:23:55,656 --> 01:23:57,490
Really?

763
01:23:57,700 --> 01:23:59,200
Good.

764
01:23:59,326 --> 01:24:01,744
Pull as hard as you can.

765
01:24:05,791 --> 01:24:07,333
Harder.

766
01:24:29,815 --> 01:24:32,233
- What's wrong?
- Wait a minute.

767
01:24:35,028 --> 01:24:38,072
It was starting
to really feel good.

768
01:24:39,908 --> 01:24:44,412
I know: I'll tie you up.
Give me your hands.

769
01:25:05,392 --> 01:25:08,728
Don't you like being choked?

770
01:25:09,438 --> 01:25:11,063
I don't mind.

771
01:25:12,524 --> 01:25:15,943
If you fight it,
I'll pull even harder.

772
01:25:16,612 --> 01:25:19,739
I said I didn't mind, didn't I?

773
01:25:20,157 --> 01:25:24,368
My body is yours.
Do as you please with it.

774
01:25:24,495 --> 01:25:28,289
Then I'll start again.

775
01:25:34,254 --> 01:25:36,923
Go as slow as you can.

776
01:27:03,176 --> 01:27:04,886
Does it hurt?

777
01:27:11,226 --> 01:27:13,686
Does it feel good?

778
01:27:16,982 --> 01:27:21,527
Like I'm part of you.

779
01:27:22,988 --> 01:27:25,573
All I see is red.

780
01:27:27,576 --> 01:27:32,121
You're so quiet.

781
01:27:32,289 --> 01:27:33,915
It's a little scary.

782
01:27:34,249 --> 01:27:36,083
Say something.

783
01:27:37,336 --> 01:27:38,794
You idiot!

784
01:27:38,921 --> 01:27:43,382
How can I talk
when you're choking me?

785
01:27:47,429 --> 01:27:49,847
Don't worry about me.
Just enjoy yourself.

786
01:27:51,725 --> 01:27:53,976
Even if I kill you?

787
01:28:00,776 --> 01:28:02,318
All right.

788
01:28:03,487 --> 01:28:05,488
I'll kill you.

789
01:28:10,327 --> 01:28:12,286
I'll kill you.

790
01:28:16,959 --> 01:28:19,377
It feels so good.

791
01:28:22,589 --> 01:28:24,131
It feels so good.

792
01:28:30,055 --> 01:28:31,555
I'll kill you.

793
01:28:33,517 --> 01:28:35,101
I'll kill you.

794
01:28:42,859 --> 01:28:44,986
I'll kill you.

795
01:29:19,104 --> 01:29:21,564
Was it good?

796
01:30:20,165 --> 01:30:22,124
If you want it that badly,

797
01:30:22,751 --> 01:30:26,253
get on top of me,
though I might not keep it up.

798
01:30:27,756 --> 01:30:29,340
Are you sure?

799
01:32:58,531 --> 01:33:00,407
Does it hurt?

800
01:33:02,619 --> 01:33:05,829
Watch me while I sleep.

801
01:33:18,176 --> 01:33:22,638
If I fall asleep,
you'll choke me again, won't you?

802
01:33:26,268 --> 01:33:27,935
You want me to choke you?

803
01:33:33,400 --> 01:33:35,401
If you strangle me...

804
01:33:37,279 --> 01:33:39,863
don't stop midway.

805
01:33:40,240 --> 01:33:42,491
It's too painful afterward.

806
01:35:30,100 --> 01:35:31,850
Kichi-san.

807
01:35:44,823 --> 01:35:46,407
I'm starting now.

808
01:36:29,325 --> 01:36:31,702
Ready?

809
01:36:31,828 --> 01:36:33,662
Not yet.

810
01:36:34,205 --> 01:36:36,290
Ready?

811
01:36:36,583 --> 01:36:38,584
Not yet.

812
01:36:45,550 --> 01:36:48,510
Ready?

813
01:36:49,679 --> 01:36:51,972
Not yet.

814
01:36:52,640 --> 01:36:55,058
Ready?

815
01:36:55,477 --> 01:36:57,478
Not yet.

816
01:37:04,152 --> 01:37:06,236
Ready?

817
01:37:24,881 --> 01:37:27,341
Ready?

818
01:37:50,240 --> 01:37:53,617
Kichi-san!

819
01:38:03,795 --> 01:38:05,420
Kichi-san.

820
01:40:00,995 --> 01:40:04,998
SADA AND KICHI
TOGETHER FOREVER

821
01:40:16,636 --> 01:40:19,304
For the next four days,
Sada carried

822
01:40:19,430 --> 01:40:22,933
his severed organ
from one Tokyo inn to another.

823
01:40:23,476 --> 01:40:27,729
She was still smiling radiantly
when she was arrested.

824
01:40:28,564 --> 01:40:31,108
The story shocked
all of Japan.

825
01:40:31,234 --> 01:40:35,070
The sympathy of the public
made her strangely popular.

826
01:40:35,863 --> 01:40:39,863
These events
took place in 1936.
