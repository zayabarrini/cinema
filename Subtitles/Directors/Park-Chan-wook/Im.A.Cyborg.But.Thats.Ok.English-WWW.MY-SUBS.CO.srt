Young-goon before the incident?

24
00:02:15,674 --> 00:02:17,426
For instance, did she stop
eating suddenly?

25
00:02:17,593 --> 00:02:22,556
I'm afraid I didn't have time
to notice things like that

I'm so busy at the restaurant.

Truth is, my mother
was raised by Young-goon.

28
00:02:34,068 --> 00:02:35,236
Pardon me?

29
00:02:35,361 --> 00:02:41,826
No, I mean, my mother
raised Young-goon.

30
00:02:43,869 --> 00:02:46,122
- That's why the young one talks
- Three, push metal plate 2 x 23 in...

Could I meet her grandmother?

33
00:02:53,963 --> 00:02:57,133
She went to a home for Alzheimer's.

34
00:02:57,299 --> 00:02:59,635
She ate nothing but radish
for six months.

35
00:03:02,179 --> 00:03:05,433
- Radish?
- Like for pickled radishes.

Yes?

38
00:03:14,066 --> 00:03:20,739
70kg of tripe, did you get
the head meat, ears, liver, and womb?

39
00:03:21,282 --> 00:03:26,454
No, we need to get at least 100kg.
You know it's hard to get nowadays.

40
00:03:28,372 --> 00:03:29,832
When I was young,

41
00:03:29,999 --> 00:03:33,836
Once when I was little, I came home
early from school with a bad headache.

42
00:03:34,003 --> 00:03:37,131
- A head?
- Yeah, head meat.

43
00:03:37,298 --> 00:03:40,301
No, get 60kg of tongue.

44
00:03:41,051 --> 00:03:42,303
Yeah.

45
00:03:45,181 --> 00:03:51,228
It hurt so much that
as soon as I got home...

46
00:03:51,353 --> 00:03:53,522
I started calling from the yard!

47
00:03:55,483 --> 00:03:56,859
Mom!

48
00:03:58,861 --> 00:04:00,237

Five, fasten the insulator to
the speaker on the front case...

50
00:04:07,786 --> 00:04:12,416
Insulator, speaker, front case,
assemble the circuit board...

51

54
00:04:25,679 --> 00:04:27,139
She was...

55
00:04:28,057 --> 00:04:30,059
Feeding some mice.

00:04:43,697 --> 00:04:47,201
The smell was really bad
whenever she ate radishes.

61
00:04:47,368 --> 00:04:48,619
10 to 25...

62
00:04:48,744 --> 00:04:51,247
- Were they pet mice?
- Normal.

63
00:04:51,372 --> 00:04:53,332
They were strangers to me.

64
00:04:53,457 --> 00:04:56,627

My mother told me.

70
00:05:13,185 --> 00:05:15,938
She had a secret that
she really shouldn't tell.

71
00:05:16,105 --> 00:05:18,315
But she didn't want
to hide it anymore

72
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:22,027
That those mice were
my little brothers and sisters.

73
00:05:22,152 --> 00:05:26,532
'As much as you're my daughter,
so are these mice'

- Wires...

Did Young-goon know about
her grandmother's story, too?

82
00:05:53,142 --> 00:05:54,435
Bind it with duct tape.

- Young-goon?
- Tape.

84

Of course not.

85
00:05:59,773 --> 00:06:04,945
Mother probably felt a little
closer to the mice that day.

Young-goon is a human being.

94
00:06:47,863 --> 00:06:52,326

wouldn't have much to do...

I wonder if a kid like you
could take the food here.

101
00:07:33,951 --> 00:07:36,620
What could your parents
be thinking of, sending you here?

102
00:07:37,579 --> 00:07:40,332
After all, parents are always
the most important factor.

103
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:44,837
For girls,
it's especially the father.

104
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,840
Like for her over there.

105
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:58,225
They say 10 years ago,
a patient disappeared.

106
00:07:58,392 --> 00:08:03,355
His name was Oh Dong-soo and
he was thin and pale like rice paper.

107
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,316
And he was plagued
by non-stop hiccups.

108
00:08:06,775 --> 00:08:10,195
The staff, the military and police,
they searched everywhere for him

109
00:08:10,362 --> 00:08:14,116
They even had the hounds up
in the mountains.

110
00:08:15,784 --> 00:08:18,120
Said he was a dangerous psychopath.

111
00:08:22,082 --> 00:08:24,835
About a week went by...

112
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,923
before they realized this clock
was making hiccupping sounds

113
00:08:30,591 --> 00:08:37,264
He was comfortably
curled up in here, dead.

114
00:08:38,056 --> 00:08:39,600
Listen.

115
00:08:42,478 --> 00:08:43,812
That sound.

116
00:08:45,647 --> 00:08:48,025
I can't live
like this anymore.

117
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:51,320
Come over here.
Look at here.

118
00:08:51,487 --> 00:08:52,946
Believe it or not, kid.

119
00:08:53,071 --> 00:08:55,449
This is crazy!

120
00:08:55,574 --> 00:08:57,826
- Listen everyone, this is insane!
- Dae-pyong, calm down!

00:08:57,993 --> 00:09:01,038
Who put you up to this?
You thieving bastards!

122
00:09:01,163 --> 00:09:04,833
How dare you imprison a police
officer on duty! Bastards!

127
00:09:15,052 --> 00:09:17,429
He did it again.

128
00:09:20,682 --> 00:09:22,810
A police officer?
Who is he kidding?

129
00:09:22,976 --> 00:09:24,645
He's just a uniform freak.

130
00:09:25,562 --> 00:09:29,650
He put on a schoolgirl uniform,
killed his wife...

131
00:09:29,775 --> 00:09:31,318
And burned his house down.

132
00:09:32,569 --> 00:09:34,321
Let's change the subject.

133
00:09:35,489 --> 00:09:39,743
That guy in the mask, they say
he used to be really handsome.

134
00:09:39,868 --> 00:09:44,039
But after he was gang raped
in the army, he went mad.

135
00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:53,215
He blamed his handsome face and
burned it with cigarette butts.

136
00:09:54,383 --> 00:10:02,349
Then he sewed up his own anus.

137
00:10:05,394 --> 00:10:08,730
That man over there.

138
00:10:09,565 --> 00:10:12,359
He's a farmer from Kyung-san.

139
00:10:12,484 --> 00:10:16,029
A nice, quiet bachelor all his life,

140
00:10:16,196 --> 00:10:18,699
good to everyone in the village.

141
00:10:18,866 --> 00:10:23,912
But he fell in love with a calf
that he delivered himself.

142
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,915
Its name was Jenny, I think.

143
00:10:27,082 --> 00:10:30,210
He brought it into his room to live

144
00:10:30,377 --> 00:10:35,340
It couldn't talk, didn't have hands,
but he would wash its face.

145
00:10:35,465 --> 00:10:37,634
And listened to the radio with it,
and so on.

146
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:41,638
The town folk thought he was a freak
and had him put in here.

147
00:10:42,389 --> 00:10:48,353
But he really only loved
Jenny platonically.

148
00:10:59,656 --> 00:11:00,824
I'm depressed.

149
00:11:11,293 --> 00:11:13,921
Who's this chick?

150
00:11:15,797 --> 00:11:17,049
Huh?

151
00:11:19,384 --> 00:11:20,552
I don't know.

152
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:30,729
Sul-mi! You're not supposed to
take a patient around like this.

153
00:11:32,064 --> 00:11:35,943
Not my fault.
Someone left her with me.

154
00:11:37,152 --> 00:11:39,738
Don't be that way with me, doctor!

155
00:11:40,155 --> 00:11:44,952
You know I'm sick! You shouldn't
embarrass me like this.

156
00:11:51,667 --> 00:11:55,253
Did she tell you many stories,
Young-goon?

157
00:11:55,379 --> 00:11:57,839
The things she tells you...

158
00:11:57,965 --> 00:12:00,133
That's right! They're all lies!

159
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:07,140
Yes, they're all lies.
It's called mythomania.

160
00:12:07,265 --> 00:12:10,227
She has an illness that makes her
tell tall tales.

161
00:12:10,352 --> 00:12:14,648
She loses all her memory each time
she gets shock therapy

162
00:12:14,773 --> 00:12:18,819
So she makes up stories to
take the place of her memories.

163
00:12:44,177 --> 00:12:45,345
What's wrong?

164
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:47,347
She won't talk.

165
00:12:47,973 --> 00:12:50,017
Psychotic depression?

166
00:12:50,183 --> 00:12:54,146
Her grandmother was schizophrenic.
Thought she was a mouse.

167
00:12:55,689 --> 00:12:57,566
Was she afraid of her mother-in-law?

168
00:12:57,691 --> 00:12:58,942
How'd you know that?

169
00:12:59,901 --> 00:13:01,445
I once saw...

170
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,741
Two patients who thought
they were mice.

171
00:13:06,742 --> 00:13:08,910
They both said they were afraid
of their mothers-in-law.

172
00:13:10,871 --> 00:13:13,123
I don't know where to start with her.

173
00:13:13,248 --> 00:13:15,751
She won't stir a finger.

174
00:13:15,876 --> 00:13:17,753
Her eyes are out of focus.

175
00:13:54,873 --> 00:13:56,333
Hey kids!

176
00:13:56,958 --> 00:14:00,545
I'm here. You fluorescent lights.

177
00:14:01,588 --> 00:14:04,466
No use pretending
you don't understand me.

178
00:14:07,302 --> 00:14:10,263
Lights here aren't very friendly,
are they?

179
00:14:12,349 --> 00:14:18,105
No matter how tired you are,
it's bad manners not to say hello.

180
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:21,942
How are you,
after working all day?

181
00:14:33,995 --> 00:14:35,831
Really?

182
00:14:36,164 --> 00:14:37,457
Then...

183
00:14:37,582 --> 00:14:40,544
Perhaps some adlay tea, please?

184
00:15:14,077 --> 00:15:15,745
Thank you kindly.

185
00:15:28,675 --> 00:15:32,554
Maybe the lights in the wards
will be friendlier.

186
00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:34,222
Since they rest at night.

187
00:15:35,265 --> 00:15:38,935
So you knew from the beginning
that you're a light?

188
00:15:42,272 --> 00:15:45,650
I only found out later in life
that I'm a cyborg.

189
00:15:46,902 --> 00:15:51,323
The white 'uns came and took
my granny away in an ambulance.

190
00:15:52,157 --> 00:15:53,825
You know the white 'uns!

191
00:15:54,659 --> 00:15:56,203
They're all over the place here.

192
00:15:56,369 --> 00:16:00,123
They wear white-doctors, nurses...

193
00:16:00,248 --> 00:16:01,541
Granny!

194
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:03,710
Right, and orderlies!

195
00:16:04,586 --> 00:16:06,338
- She took the radish.
- Granny!

196
00:16:06,463 --> 00:16:09,216
But left her dentures.
So I ran after her with them.

197
00:16:09,966 --> 00:16:14,137
Granny needs them to eat radish.
She's a mouse, you know.

198
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,934
Just then, a bike came up
and took me.

199
00:16:20,769 --> 00:16:24,522
But a bike can't beat an ambulance.

200
00:16:24,648 --> 00:16:26,733
Even a kid in knickers knows that.

201
00:16:27,567 --> 00:16:31,529
So I bawled and you know
what the bike said?

202
00:16:31,655 --> 00:16:34,407
'A cyborg can beat anything'.

203
00:16:34,574 --> 00:16:37,452
'How come you don't know that
when you're a cyborg yourself?'

204
00:16:38,662 --> 00:16:41,915
So I had to pretend
I had always known.

205
00:16:42,582 --> 00:16:47,754
But the problem was I couldn't
catch up to the ambulance for real.

206
00:16:48,797 --> 00:16:53,134
So, ask me what I said
to the bike then.

207
00:16:53,677 --> 00:16:58,139
'Confounded fool,
I'm all out of battery, you moron'.

208
00:16:59,057 --> 00:17:01,101
So I endeavored to recharge
by listening

209
00:17:01,268 --> 00:17:03,937
to educationalbroadcasts
at the factory.

210
00:17:06,064 --> 00:17:08,817
I'm only fully recharged
when it lights up to here.

211
00:17:08,984 --> 00:17:12,237
But look, I'm almost on empty.

212
00:17:14,864 --> 00:17:20,745
I did as the broadcast told me,
and the ambulance brought me here.

213
00:17:22,163 --> 00:17:24,249
I'm a machine, but...

214
00:17:24,374 --> 00:17:29,629
I didn't come with an instruction
manual or a label on me anywhere.

215
00:17:31,756 --> 00:17:34,426
I still don't know what my purpose is.

216
00:17:35,343 --> 00:17:37,345
What was I made for?

217
00:17:44,769 --> 00:17:47,314
You didn't eat your lunch, did you?

218
00:17:49,983 --> 00:17:54,738
You won't be able to starve
yourself to death that way.

219
00:17:56,197 --> 00:18:00,827
The cafeteria ladies keep tabs
on everything you eat.

220
00:18:02,579 --> 00:18:06,124
A girl like you once tried
to starve herself to death.

221
00:18:06,249 --> 00:18:08,335
She was so enthusiastic.

222
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:15,633
But hospitals have
force-feeding machines.

223
00:18:17,385 --> 00:18:23,350
Doctors and professors meet
to confer on how to feed you...

224
00:18:25,477 --> 00:18:32,025
It's embarrassing to have them force
food up your nose in front of people.

225
00:18:33,693 --> 00:18:38,031
So that girl is still eating,
and alive and kicking.

226
00:18:38,948 --> 00:18:40,617
Sad, isn't it?

227
00:18:41,743 --> 00:18:43,411
So I was thinking...

228
00:18:44,871 --> 00:18:47,916
Want me to help you?

229
00:19:39,676 --> 00:19:43,054
Broadcast, broadcast!

230
00:19:43,179 --> 00:19:46,015
Brooadcast!

231
00:19:59,487 --> 00:20:04,117
Listen. There are some
really good messages.

232
00:20:15,003 --> 00:20:16,963
Time for meditation.

233
00:20:18,548 --> 00:20:24,304
Get up and listen to the hum of
the fridge in the middle of night

234
00:20:25,972 --> 00:20:28,016
On a cold winter morning.

235
00:20:28,975 --> 00:20:33,521
Feel the sound of the boiler
that has been running all night

236
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:41,237
They move us to tears because
they have a purpose of existence.

237
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:49,662
Think of the lighthouse's holy
and beautiful heart of love.

238
00:20:51,664 --> 00:20:54,334
To be continued.

239
00:21:00,048 --> 00:21:06,346
If only I had just one
purpose of existence, too.

240
00:21:15,271 --> 00:21:19,359
ll-soon, please, your mask!

241
00:21:23,196 --> 00:21:26,199
Will the pretty Gop-dahn
please explain?

242
00:21:26,366 --> 00:21:30,036
Our hospital has stabilizing rooms...

243
00:21:30,745 --> 00:21:35,708
for those who cause discomfort
to others or create safety issues.

244
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:39,254
And when it is deemed
a necessary treatment...

245
00:21:39,587 --> 00:21:43,007
- With the patient's consent.
- What consent?

246
00:21:43,174 --> 00:21:44,926
You told me to stay in
the stabilizing

247
00:21:45,093 --> 00:21:47,554
room until I gave my consent!

248
00:21:47,887 --> 00:21:49,931
I told you before that if you hit
others for no reason like that...

249
00:21:50,098 --> 00:21:53,851
You have to go in the stabilizing room.

250
00:21:53,977 --> 00:21:56,646
But ll-soon is a thief!

251
00:21:57,397 --> 00:22:02,735
A detestable and shameless psycho,
anti-social and schizophrenic!

252
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:04,821
Isn't that an attack
on his character?

253
00:22:04,946 --> 00:22:07,532
It's not an attack!
It's defense!

254
00:22:07,657 --> 00:22:10,034
He stole something
very important to me!

255
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:16,916
Alright, what did ll-soon steal
from you, Dae-pyong?

256
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:19,961
They all point to me
if anything goes missing.

257
00:22:20,086 --> 00:22:26,551
For the past 3 days, I can't
even receive a simple serve.

258
00:22:26,676 --> 00:22:31,514
While Park ll-soon won 5 games
just yesterday!

259
00:22:31,639 --> 00:22:38,104
With the unique service technique
that I developed 12 years ago!

260
00:22:40,857 --> 00:22:44,319
There's no point not stealing.
They all think I did it anyway.

261
00:22:44,485 --> 00:22:46,446
Come on, that's not true.

262
00:22:49,574 --> 00:22:51,951
...12 years ago!

263
00:22:56,497 --> 00:23:01,336
I see, you lost your ping-pong game.

264
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:03,838
It was about a month ago.

265
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:09,844
I suddenly lost my appetite
and couldn't eat.

266
00:23:11,179 --> 00:23:13,431
Think of what it did to my skin!

267
00:23:14,057 --> 00:23:19,020
ll-soon came and ate all my food.

268
00:23:19,187 --> 00:23:21,522
He's the one who stole the elastic
band around my waist

269
00:23:21,689 --> 00:23:22,649
for a whole week.

270
00:23:22,774 --> 00:23:24,442
The elastic band
for your pajamas?

271
00:23:24,567 --> 00:23:28,738
No, this skin colored elastic band
I was born with around my waist!

272
00:23:28,863 --> 00:23:30,239
Look at this.
It's all stretched out!

273
00:23:30,365 --> 00:23:32,950
Does he mean he was born
wearing pajamas?

274
00:23:34,077 --> 00:23:39,415
Then is ll-soon the one who stole
my memory, too?

275
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:41,417
You bastard!

276
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,837
You thief!

277
00:23:46,964 --> 00:23:49,425
- Give me back my ping-pong!
- You stretched my band!

278
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:52,220
Mr. Pajamas, please!

279
00:24:00,269 --> 00:24:05,942
I told you your mother
didn't leave because of you.

280
00:24:13,658 --> 00:24:15,827
Yeah, right!

281
00:24:16,744 --> 00:24:19,122
Then how come she never
called but once?

282
00:24:19,872 --> 00:24:21,541
To tell me not to forget to
brush my teeth before bed!

283
00:24:24,585 --> 00:24:26,546
Fine! I'll admit it!

284
00:24:27,588 --> 00:24:29,132
Last night, I stole Thursday.

285
00:24:30,466 --> 00:24:31,551
Whose Thursday?

286
00:24:39,475 --> 00:24:42,562
How can a person steal Thursday?

287
00:25:05,293 --> 00:25:07,920
Look, Thursday's panties are missing.

288
00:25:11,966 --> 00:25:14,260
Monday's are right here, where else?

289
00:25:15,386 --> 00:25:18,222
I had no idea.

290
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:20,808
He's really good.

291
00:25:21,768 --> 00:25:24,020
This is a fortuitous crossing of
paths, for sure.

292
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,608
I must find out more about this thief.

293
00:25:29,275 --> 00:25:34,739
I have this thing
I want someone

294
00:25:34,864 --> 00:25:38,618
to steal away from me.

295
00:25:41,996 --> 00:25:44,248
I don't know how I'll ever thank you.

296
00:25:53,841 --> 00:25:55,635
So sorry for being so slow!

297
00:26:14,195 --> 00:26:16,322
Hello, everyone!
How are you?

298
00:26:16,781 --> 00:26:18,950
- Have you had lunch?
- Sure.

299
00:26:20,701 --> 00:26:22,036
Yeah, I have.

300
00:26:22,995 --> 00:26:26,499
Have you had lunch?

301
00:26:27,458 --> 00:26:28,835
Don't skip the meal.

302
00:26:59,574 --> 00:27:00,700
Psycho.

303
00:27:08,583 --> 00:27:10,418
I'm not a psy-cho.

304
00:27:12,587 --> 00:27:14,130
I'm a cy-borg.

305
00:27:17,758 --> 00:27:20,344
Ah, I let slip.

306
00:27:21,095 --> 00:27:23,139
I promised Mom I wouldn't.

307
00:27:35,568 --> 00:27:40,448
Mom, I think I'm a cyborg.

308
00:27:49,081 --> 00:27:50,833
What's that?

309
00:27:51,083 --> 00:27:56,255
I think it's kind of like a robot?

310
00:28:02,678 --> 00:28:05,723
Have you missed a period?
Because you're a cybor?

311
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:10,937
Anything you want to eat?
Like radishes?

312
00:28:26,869 --> 00:28:30,456
Then it's okay.
Now go get some sleep.

313
00:28:32,375 --> 00:28:35,461
It's okay if you're a cybor.

314
00:28:36,671 --> 00:28:39,507
It won't interfere with
the way you live.

315
00:28:39,674 --> 00:28:41,634
Just don't let anybody know.

316
00:28:43,678 --> 00:28:49,016
Who would come to eat at a shop
where the daughter's a cybor?

317
00:28:49,558 --> 00:28:54,730
Cyborg, are you thinking of
your Granny?

318
00:28:55,564 --> 00:28:57,525
I certainly am.

319
00:28:58,693 --> 00:29:02,238
You aren't feeling sad, are you?

320
00:29:03,072 --> 00:29:06,659
No, why of course not!

321
00:29:07,368 --> 00:29:10,454
She's wondering about you, too...

322
00:29:10,788 --> 00:29:14,625
And why you haven't killed
the white 'uns yet.

323
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:19,213
She wonders why you don't bag
the white 'uns that dragged her away.

324
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:22,341
And bring her the dentures.

325
00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:24,343
But I...

326
00:29:26,971 --> 00:29:28,848
I don't have enough power.

327
00:29:30,474 --> 00:29:36,731
This charging method seems to
have its limitations.

328
00:29:37,273 --> 00:29:40,234
I hope it's not
because of sympathy.

329
00:29:40,401 --> 00:29:45,239
You know that sympathy is
the worst of the 7 Deadly Sins.

330
00:29:46,574 --> 00:29:47,825
No, really...

331
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:52,038
It's not because of sympathy.

332
00:29:53,372 --> 00:29:57,043
For your reference,
the other 6 are as follows.

333
00:29:57,585 --> 00:29:59,420
Being sad.

334
00:30:02,465 --> 00:30:03,841
Restlessness.

335
00:30:08,596 --> 00:30:09,722
Hesitating about anything.

336
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,643
Useless daydreaming.

337
00:30:17,104 --> 00:30:18,397
Feeling guilty.

338
00:30:22,443 --> 00:30:24,236
Thankfulness.

339
00:30:24,862 --> 00:30:28,324
The above was in
the order of evilness.

340
00:30:30,951 --> 00:30:32,119
Yes

341
00:30:33,162 --> 00:30:38,417
Useless daydreaming about whether
the white 'uns have grannies, too...

342
00:30:40,086 --> 00:30:45,758
Sympathy for their grannies
if the white 'uns died...

343
00:30:46,675 --> 00:30:51,222
And hesitating about killing them.
You must forego these sins.

344
00:31:03,859 --> 00:31:06,028
Floriculture Therapy

345
00:31:06,362 --> 00:31:07,738
Take your ping-pong back.

346
00:31:08,364 --> 00:31:11,742
It makes my butt itchy
every time I play.

347
00:31:15,162 --> 00:31:16,664
The right cheek.

348
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:19,041
Transfer!

349
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:52,825
- Go Dae-pyong!
- Go, doc!

350
00:31:56,579 --> 00:31:58,122
He is very polite.

351
00:31:58,539 --> 00:32:01,208
He's so humble he can't
even walk forwards.

352
00:32:02,543 --> 00:32:04,211
Court etiquette, he says.

353
00:32:10,759 --> 00:32:13,721
He thinks it's his fault
when anything goes wrong.

354
00:32:16,056 --> 00:32:17,558
Are you there?

355
00:32:18,767 --> 00:32:20,644
- Hello?
- What is it?!

356
00:32:20,769 --> 00:32:24,857
Just wondering if it was
my fault you lost?

357
00:32:27,985 --> 00:32:30,946
He happened to drive past
the scene of an accident...

358
00:32:31,071 --> 00:32:33,324
And he was convinced
it was his fault.

359
00:32:36,744 --> 00:32:39,622
He followed the victims around
apologizing.

360
00:32:39,747 --> 00:32:41,749
When they couldn't stand it
any longer...

361
00:32:41,874 --> 00:32:43,626
They reported him and
he was brought to this hospital.

362
00:32:45,252 --> 00:32:46,754
I said no!

363
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,840
It wasn't your fault, Duk-chun.

364
00:32:49,965 --> 00:32:54,637
It's my ping-pong!
It's too itchy to play!

365
00:32:57,765 --> 00:33:00,351
Duk-chun is an expert at saying
redundant things.

366
00:33:01,268 --> 00:33:06,398
Isn't ping-pong about
giving and receiving?

367
00:33:08,067 --> 00:33:10,819
I don't think so!

368
00:33:10,945 --> 00:33:15,824
Must one always receive
after giving?

369
00:33:16,784 --> 00:33:21,830
Can't there be ping-pong
where we only give?

370
00:33:29,463 --> 00:33:33,133
So it was my fault.

371
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:46,522
A cat is, above all,
a furry animal.

372
00:33:50,567 --> 00:33:55,322
Actually, my wife is furry, too.

373
00:33:59,868 --> 00:34:04,039
Isn't it obvious I'd become impotent

374
00:34:04,164 --> 00:34:06,166
with a furry wife?

375
00:34:06,875 --> 00:34:10,045
I'll hear from the judiciary soon.

376
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:12,423
I filed a suit against her.

377
00:34:13,257 --> 00:34:17,720
She hid that she's a furry monster
when we got married.

378
00:34:18,846 --> 00:34:24,935
Making a police officer impotent is
an obstruction of his duties.

379
00:34:33,277 --> 00:34:35,654
Alright, transfer!

380
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,207
Hello, there!

381
00:34:48,876 --> 00:34:51,337
How are you all doing?

382
00:34:52,463 --> 00:34:54,006
Have you had lunch?

383
00:34:54,173 --> 00:34:55,341
Hello!

384
00:34:55,466 --> 00:34:57,634
How are you? Hello!

385
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,719
Have you had lunch?

386
00:34:59,762 --> 00:35:00,929
Oh my god.

387
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:02,348
I'm so sorry.

388
00:35:02,473 --> 00:35:04,433
Are you okay?

389
00:35:04,558 --> 00:35:05,934
I'm so sorry.

390
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:08,145
- How can I tell you how sorry I am?
- I'm so tired!

391
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:10,647
I'm sorry I made you tired.

392
00:35:10,773 --> 00:35:13,650
Why do I always tire people out
like this? I'm sorry.

393
00:35:14,568 --> 00:35:18,530
I had a dream...

394
00:35:19,865 --> 00:35:25,537
To make amends to everyone
I've ever troubled.

395
00:35:28,874 --> 00:35:34,421
People should make amends
whenever they've caused trouble.

396
00:35:38,175 --> 00:35:39,551
But now...

397
00:35:40,386 --> 00:35:42,638
I've had all my politeness stolen.

398
00:35:43,972 --> 00:35:47,559
Now how am I supposed to apologize?

399
00:35:47,768 --> 00:35:52,022
Do you remember
where you lost it?

400
00:35:52,147 --> 00:35:56,026
You people don't know what
it's like to have troubled others!

401
00:35:56,151 --> 00:35:57,820
You bitch!

402
00:36:13,694 --> 00:36:15,446
Please steal it.

403
00:36:16,781 --> 00:36:18,532
My sympathy.

404
00:36:20,367 --> 00:36:21,744
Like Thursday.

405
00:36:21,869 --> 00:36:23,370
Sympathy?

406
00:36:24,205 --> 00:36:25,331
What's that?

407
00:36:25,956 --> 00:36:29,502
The feeling that stops me
from killing those I should.

408
00:36:31,879 --> 00:36:34,006
I keep thinking...

409
00:36:34,882 --> 00:36:36,842
What if I killed the white 'uns...

410
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:42,848
And they have grannies, too?
The poor grannies...

411
00:36:45,392 --> 00:36:46,519
Look, miss.

412
00:36:46,977 --> 00:36:49,146
When you speak to a person,

413
00:36:49,271 --> 00:36:51,649
You have to speak so that
the person can understand.

414
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,236
Well, sympathy is...

415
00:36:57,196 --> 00:37:01,826
My mom, aunt and uncle
shouldn't have acted that way!

416
00:37:02,243 --> 00:37:04,411
How could they have
so little sympathy?

417
00:37:05,579 --> 00:37:07,706
No one's a mouse because
they want to be a mouse.

418
00:37:07,873 --> 00:37:09,416
Don't even talk about moms!

419
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,128
I'm sorry.

420
00:37:14,672 --> 00:37:19,218
And if you keep asking me
to steal something...

421
00:37:19,385 --> 00:37:22,138
That's not stealing. It's just
taking what you're giving.

422
00:37:23,264 --> 00:37:24,849
Then what should I do?

423
00:37:24,974 --> 00:37:27,226
Well, when I...

424
00:37:29,603 --> 00:37:33,232
When I set out to steal
something from someone...

425
00:37:33,357 --> 00:37:36,318
I have to watch that person
stealthily for a few days.

426
00:37:37,069 --> 00:37:38,529
Can you do that?

427
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,906
No problem.

428
00:37:41,073 --> 00:37:45,536
I have to watch them stealthily
and find something I want to steal

429
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:50,541
Then I get the stealthy
desire to steal.

430
00:37:52,459 --> 00:37:54,044
Are you really up to this?

431
00:37:55,296 --> 00:37:56,547
You can trust me.

432
00:37:57,089 --> 00:37:59,466
Once I have the stealthy
desire to steal...

433
00:37:59,967 --> 00:38:02,553
It can only be completed if I steal
without the person's consent.

434
00:38:02,678 --> 00:38:04,513
They have to hate
my stealing from them.

435
00:38:04,638 --> 00:38:06,515
Can you do that for me?

436
00:38:08,058 --> 00:38:11,729
promise to hate it.
I beg of you to do it.

437
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:16,609
Since I walk backwards
she can't follow me...

438
00:38:16,775 --> 00:38:19,028
So she spends her time
talking to machines

439
00:38:19,153 --> 00:38:20,321
with those dentures in.

440
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:24,325
She holds her hand out to doctors
and nurses to shake hands...

441
00:38:24,992 --> 00:38:28,954
And she wants to very much
but then suddenly pulls away.

442
00:38:35,085 --> 00:38:37,630
She loathes it so much
her hands tremble.

443
00:38:39,173 --> 00:38:41,717
Why does she hold out her hand if
she dislikes shaking hands so much?

444
00:38:44,261 --> 00:38:46,513
She hasn't done much,
why is she so exhausted?

445
00:38:58,067 --> 00:38:59,818
Because she doesn't eat, no wonder.

446
00:39:42,194 --> 00:39:43,362
Coffee.

447
00:39:48,951 --> 00:39:50,119
Black.

448
00:39:56,875 --> 00:40:00,546
Are you over your flickering now?

449
00:40:16,186 --> 00:40:19,815
Lights, vending machine,
public phone, hiccup clock!

450
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:23,027
Have you seen my granny's dentures?

451
00:40:23,152 --> 00:40:27,614
You can't understand me
without the dentures, can you?

452
00:40:35,789 --> 00:40:38,417
Where are those dentures?

453
00:40:38,584 --> 00:40:42,046
Young-goon doesn't eat her food.

454
00:40:44,673 --> 00:40:47,259
Gop-dahn eats it.

455
00:40:47,384 --> 00:40:50,554
Young-goon doesn't eat her food.
P.S. Gop-dahn eats it.

456
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:59,938
For today's gathering,
we're talking about

457
00:41:00,064 --> 00:41:01,815
our most painful partings.

458
00:41:01,982 --> 00:41:05,527
How about you Duk-chun?

459
00:41:05,861 --> 00:41:06,820
Ready...

460
00:41:06,987 --> 00:41:10,240
My most painful parting was?

461
00:41:10,366 --> 00:41:11,450
My most painful parting was?

462
00:41:11,575 --> 00:41:15,537
My most painful parting was?

463
00:41:15,662 --> 00:41:16,830
Mother...

464
00:41:19,291 --> 00:41:20,459
fucker!

465
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,220
How about me, doctor?

466
00:41:31,553 --> 00:41:33,639
Sure! Ready?

467
00:41:33,764 --> 00:41:37,309
My most painful parting was?

468
00:41:40,479 --> 00:41:42,940
When I was 15 and my mom left home...

469
00:41:47,694 --> 00:41:50,239
She took the entire family set
of electrical toothbrushes...

470
00:41:51,073 --> 00:41:52,658
And left for good.

471
00:41:53,492 --> 00:41:56,662
After that, I became a thief.

472
00:42:21,979 --> 00:42:23,647
You damned thief!

473
00:42:39,955 --> 00:42:41,707
Take your politeness back, mister.

474
00:42:42,374 --> 00:42:46,420
Your walking backwards and
saying redundant things, all of it.

475
00:42:47,463 --> 00:42:51,425
But why? I don't want to.

476
00:42:52,092 --> 00:42:54,720
People can't follow me from behind!

477
00:42:55,596 --> 00:42:57,639
Here. Transfer!

478
00:43:16,074 --> 00:43:18,952
This news just in.

479
00:43:23,457 --> 00:43:28,253
She was moved to a nearby hospital
but never woke from her coma

480
00:43:36,386 --> 00:43:39,014
Granny is... critical?

481
00:43:42,476 --> 00:43:45,103
In critical condition...

482
00:43:45,854 --> 00:43:46,939
The white 'uns...

483
00:43:47,981 --> 00:43:50,526
Granny... earring...

484
00:43:54,571 --> 00:43:57,533
Oh... eating... radish...

485
00:43:58,867 --> 00:43:59,952
They don't like it.

486
00:44:00,994 --> 00:44:02,120
So...

487
00:44:02,996 --> 00:44:06,416
They won't let me give
her the dentures.

488
00:44:08,794 --> 00:44:11,922
My Granny... loves...

489
00:44:12,756 --> 00:44:14,424
radish... so much...

490
00:44:15,259 --> 00:44:18,136
I must... kill them... all.

491
00:44:20,472 --> 00:44:21,640
Confounded bastards...

492
00:44:27,771 --> 00:44:28,939
Please...

493
00:44:29,273 --> 00:44:30,524
Steal...

494
00:44:32,359 --> 00:44:33,527
My sympathy!

495
00:44:41,702 --> 00:44:43,161
Stop crying!

496
00:44:45,956 --> 00:44:47,124
Do you hate it?

497
00:44:49,042 --> 00:44:50,210
No?

498
00:44:53,755 --> 00:44:57,009
I told you that you must hate it!

499
00:45:04,766 --> 00:45:06,727
I hate it! I hate it! I hate it!

500
00:45:06,893 --> 00:45:08,645
I truly hate it!

501
00:45:14,985 --> 00:45:17,362
I'm taking away your sympathy.

502
00:45:18,655 --> 00:45:20,324
Alright, transfer!

503
00:45:28,457 --> 00:45:32,628
When I count to five and
snap my fingers, open your eyes.

504
00:45:34,087 --> 00:45:39,343
One, two, three, four.

505
00:45:39,468 --> 00:45:40,636
Five.

506
00:45:43,388 --> 00:45:45,349
No sympathy.

507
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:48,060
Young-goon!

508
00:46:09,164 --> 00:46:10,332
Young-goon?

509
00:46:43,490 --> 00:46:44,616
My battery...

510
00:46:46,868 --> 00:46:48,537
Battery is...

511
00:46:50,372 --> 00:46:51,623
Empty.

512
00:46:51,790 --> 00:46:52,958
Young-goon!

513
00:46:58,046 --> 00:46:58,922
Young-goon?

514
00:47:00,173 --> 00:47:01,299
Young-goon?

515
00:47:17,274 --> 00:47:18,442
Wang Gop-dahn!

516
00:47:19,276 --> 00:47:20,444
Gop-dahn!

517
00:47:24,698 --> 00:47:26,533
Tell me the truth

518
00:47:28,869 --> 00:47:32,497
Did you really eat
Young-goon's food?

519
00:47:34,541 --> 00:47:38,003
Beautiful Berne.

520
00:47:38,253 --> 00:47:42,507
Where the clear stream flows.

521
00:47:45,761 --> 00:47:47,846
How much more will
I have to practice...

522
00:47:48,972 --> 00:47:52,642
to get into the Edelweiss
Boys' and Girls' Choir?

523
00:47:53,477 --> 00:47:56,646
In my case, I have an elastic band
around my waist

524
00:47:56,772 --> 00:47:59,441
I always feel reassured
even in strange places.

525
00:47:59,983 --> 00:48:03,236
Stop, or our eyes will meet
and it will be scandalous.

526
00:48:04,654 --> 00:48:12,412
Red alpine roses.
Blooming in the dew.

527
00:48:12,579 --> 00:48:15,207
When my life reaches its end.

528
00:48:15,373 --> 00:48:17,751
The elastic band will be
stretched to its limit

529
00:48:18,752 --> 00:48:22,839
I've already been practicing for
31 years since I failed the audition.

530
00:48:22,964 --> 00:48:24,841
Snap! And I'll just go back...

531
00:48:25,175 --> 00:48:28,053
To where I started off originally.

532
00:48:28,261 --> 00:48:32,432
Das Obuh-lan-ya Obuh-lan.

533
00:48:32,599 --> 00:48:36,144
The beautiful mountains of Berne.

534
00:48:36,269 --> 00:48:43,235
Das Obuh-lan-ya Obuh-lan,
Oh, my love Berne...

535
00:48:44,277 --> 00:48:47,030
Do you think humans can
go against gravity?

536
00:48:48,865 --> 00:48:49,908
Do you think...

537
00:48:50,784 --> 00:48:52,035
humans can go...

538
00:48:52,953 --> 00:48:54,955
against gravity?

539
00:49:07,175 --> 00:49:09,052
I succeeded in my experiment!

540
00:49:18,061 --> 00:49:19,312
Sleep flying!

541
00:49:19,771 --> 00:49:24,025
Peppermint sherbet and
persimmon socks

542
00:49:24,651 --> 00:49:29,447
They create static electrical tension.

543
00:49:29,865 --> 00:49:33,118
And that makes the body float.

544
00:49:35,078 --> 00:49:37,038
Like superconducting
magnetically levitated trains.

545
00:49:37,163 --> 00:49:39,958
Watch. Here I go.

546
00:49:57,976 --> 00:50:02,439
Should avoid eating things like
chicken right before flying.

547
00:50:03,273 --> 00:50:07,444
Young-goon's always lying down
so I can't see her much these days

548
00:50:07,569 --> 00:50:10,655
Can you see me, Sul-mi?

549
00:50:11,865 --> 00:50:14,159
Partially, but...

550
00:50:16,786 --> 00:50:18,914
Why don't you take it off?

551
00:50:27,881 --> 00:50:29,716
What if I do and I'm invisible?

552
00:50:31,051 --> 00:50:33,219
My mom and dad used to act like
I wasn't there,

553
00:50:33,386 --> 00:50:35,013
even when I was.

554
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:37,349
That's why I'm good at stealing.

555
00:50:37,474 --> 00:50:38,934
Because people can't see
me sometimes.

556
00:50:39,768 --> 00:50:41,645
From the time I was 20,
I learned electrical wiring.

557
00:50:41,770 --> 00:50:44,856
I made good money,
but I got caught stealing a motorcycle.

558
00:50:44,981 --> 00:50:49,736
When I was being tried, the judge
said something only I could hear

559
00:50:49,903 --> 00:50:57,118
Defendant Park ll-soon
will eventually vanish into a dot.

560
00:50:58,870 --> 00:51:01,247
You shithead!

561
00:51:07,253 --> 00:51:08,546
Oh dear!

562
00:51:10,382 --> 00:51:13,051
I did all kinds of things in jail

563
00:51:13,176 --> 00:51:15,053
Because I felt like I was vanishing.

564
00:51:16,096 --> 00:51:17,931
I stole other people's
clothes to wear

565
00:51:19,182 --> 00:51:20,934
And I brushed my teeth diligently.

566
00:51:25,146 --> 00:51:28,233
Once your teeth start to go,
there's no turning back.

567
00:51:28,358 --> 00:51:29,609
That's true.

568
00:51:31,361 --> 00:51:33,321
I had a psych evaluation and...

569
00:51:33,446 --> 00:51:36,032
They said I'm schizophrenic
and anti-social.

570
00:51:36,866 --> 00:51:38,410
Anti-social?

571
00:51:39,577 --> 00:51:42,122
Like stealing and fighting
for no reason.

572
00:51:42,288 --> 00:51:45,625
And not having any sense of
guilt or sympathy.

573
00:51:46,376 --> 00:51:49,254
But I don't know why
they call me anti-social.

574
00:51:49,671 --> 00:51:53,633
I have my reasons for stealing.
I'm afraid I'll vanish.

575
00:51:54,384 --> 00:51:57,554
I'm anti-vanishing.

576
00:52:00,265 --> 00:52:02,642
They say there's no cure
for being anti-social.

577
00:52:02,767 --> 00:52:05,020
But the doctor says to have hope.

578
00:52:05,979 --> 00:52:09,024
Sometimes it goes away on its own
30 or 40 years later.

579
00:52:09,566 --> 00:52:12,318
Though usually that 30-40 years
are spent in prison...

580
00:52:12,652 --> 00:52:13,820
I see.

581
00:52:15,155 --> 00:52:17,741
I admit myself here because
I don't want to go to prison.

582
00:52:18,491 --> 00:52:18,992
Taxi!

583
00:52:19,075 --> 00:52:21,745
When I feel it coming on,
I head straight back here.

584
00:52:23,997 --> 00:52:26,750
This is my fifth hospitalization
in four years.

585
00:52:28,001 --> 00:52:32,005
With steady labor, I can manage
the hospital and medication costs.

586
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:37,135
But do you think I can hold out
for 40 years like this?

587
00:52:38,053 --> 00:52:39,804
Without vanishing into a dot?

588
00:52:45,477 --> 00:52:47,145
What do you think?

589
00:52:55,361 --> 00:52:56,529
Just...

590
00:52:59,074 --> 00:53:00,450
Give up hope.

591
00:53:02,994 --> 00:53:04,162
And...

592
00:53:07,373 --> 00:53:08,500
Keep your strength up!

593
00:53:15,381 --> 00:53:16,508
Strength?

594
00:53:17,383 --> 00:53:19,511
But Young-goon has no strength!

595
00:53:20,470 --> 00:53:23,431
I never thought you'd open up
about yourself like that.

596
00:53:24,182 --> 00:53:28,228
Well, you're getting
shock therapy today.

597
00:53:29,771 --> 00:53:30,939
Sul-mi?

598
00:53:32,190 --> 00:53:34,067
People tend to think

599
00:53:34,192 --> 00:53:37,445
that shock therapy is inhumane

600
00:53:37,570 --> 00:53:39,405
But it isn't really, ma'am.

601
00:53:39,864 --> 00:53:43,326
It's a widely used treatment for
depression or catatonia.

602
00:53:43,451 --> 00:53:44,536
I see.

603
00:53:44,661 --> 00:53:47,038
There are patients who don't eat.

604
00:53:47,247 --> 00:53:49,290
Because of auditory hallucinations,
delusions, or emotional distress.

605
00:53:49,624 --> 00:53:51,709
They usually start eating again

606
00:53:51,835 --> 00:53:54,587
after 2-3 days
when medicated.

607
00:53:55,421 --> 00:53:59,509
But Young-goon has such
serious side effects to medication.

608
00:54:01,052 --> 00:54:05,014
Young-goon doesn't eat,
sleep, or move.

609
00:54:05,140 --> 00:54:08,309
She throws up her medication.

610
00:54:08,434 --> 00:54:10,520
She's completely catatonic.

611
00:54:10,645 --> 00:54:13,606
Are there side effects
to shock therapy?

612
00:54:13,731 --> 00:54:16,192
There can be some memory loss.

613
00:54:16,317 --> 00:54:21,698
That loss is okay,
but please just make her eat again.

614
00:55:08,161 --> 00:55:09,329
ou get here?

615
00:55:11,998 --> 00:55:17,045
I should be getting merciless
as soon as possible...

616
00:55:19,839 --> 00:55:23,718
Since I'm the only one
you've got, Granny.

617
00:55:26,846 --> 00:55:28,640
Just wait.

618
00:55:29,682 --> 00:55:32,810
I'll get you your dentures

619
00:55:33,478 --> 00:55:35,021
And kill them all.

620
00:55:42,862 --> 00:55:43,738
What?

621
00:55:43,863 --> 00:55:46,449
The purpose of...

622
00:55:47,867 --> 00:55:49,160
What?

623
00:55:51,454 --> 00:55:53,706
Of existence is...

624
00:56:00,755 --> 00:56:02,423
Slowly.

625
00:56:06,469 --> 00:56:07,929
Granny.

626
00:56:08,471 --> 00:56:09,639
What?

627
00:56:12,558 --> 00:56:14,060
50%

628
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:15,937
60%

629
00:56:16,771 --> 00:56:18,231
70%

630
00:56:18,898 --> 00:56:20,358
80%

631
00:56:21,067 --> 00:56:22,652
90%

632
00:56:23,403 --> 00:56:25,113
Charging complete!

633
00:56:41,462 --> 00:56:42,630
Are you okay?

634
00:56:44,590 --> 00:56:45,842
Yes.

635
00:56:46,467 --> 00:56:47,844
Who am I?

636
00:56:49,387 --> 00:56:52,557
Dr. Choi Seul-ki

637
00:56:52,682 --> 00:56:54,350
Who's the president of Korea?

638
00:56:57,395 --> 00:57:00,023
It's okay. It'll come to you.

639
00:57:00,148 --> 00:57:03,526
That kind of memory skips back soon.

640
00:57:08,364 --> 00:57:10,533
I never knew in the first place.

641
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:17,332
What do you remember?

642
00:57:17,790 --> 00:57:19,751
Everything.

643
00:57:20,877 --> 00:57:25,423
It was quiet and I was hooked up
with wires all over me.

644
00:57:25,590 --> 00:57:27,759
What else?

645
00:57:27,884 --> 00:57:30,053
In the incubator.

646
00:57:32,138 --> 00:57:34,307
My granny told me.

647
00:57:35,141 --> 00:57:38,019
She said I was weak from birth

648
00:57:38,770 --> 00:57:44,734
They were afraid I'd die so
I was in an incubator for a while

649
00:57:46,361 --> 00:57:50,823
Electrical wires came all around
and raised me.

650
00:57:51,657 --> 00:57:52,950
Young-goon.

651
00:57:53,076 --> 00:57:56,829
Can you tell me why you won't eat?

652
00:57:57,663 --> 00:58:01,125
Do you hear voices
telling you not to eat?

653
00:58:01,292 --> 00:58:03,336
Are you worried the food
is poisoned?

654
00:58:03,503 --> 00:58:05,421
Do you want to starve
yourself to death?

655
00:58:05,755 --> 00:58:07,423
It's okay

656
00:58:07,548 --> 00:58:10,927
I sometimes
feel like dying, too.

657
00:58:14,555 --> 00:58:17,809
Why would a young lady
like you want to die?

658
00:58:18,684 --> 00:58:20,812
We must carry on living
through thick and thin.

659
00:58:25,483 --> 00:58:27,735
I can walk from here.

660
00:58:28,694 --> 00:58:30,530
I can feel my strength coming back.

661
00:58:33,866 --> 00:58:36,661
I feel like I've been born again.

662
00:59:09,193 --> 00:59:11,112
No hesitating about anything.

663
01:02:22,678 --> 01:02:24,639
No feeling guilty.

664
01:02:32,563 --> 01:02:37,234
'I feel so sorry for her
I could die'

665
01:02:40,780 --> 01:02:42,239
'Please take care...

666
01:02:42,948 --> 01:02:45,242
of Young-goon'.

667
01:02:48,579 --> 01:02:51,248
'I think I'm feeling'...

668
01:02:54,669 --> 01:02:59,423
'Sym... Sympathy for Young-goon?'

669
01:03:04,345 --> 01:03:07,014
You're saying you feel sympathy?

670
01:03:09,850 --> 01:03:12,436
Please steal Gop-dahn's
sleep flying method.

671
01:03:14,647 --> 01:03:18,734
She has developed
a strange way of flying.

672
01:03:19,151 --> 01:03:21,821
And she flies to Kyu-suk
every night and troubles him.

673
01:03:25,282 --> 01:03:28,536
I'll give you my voice in exchange.

674
01:03:30,496 --> 01:03:33,332
You're listening to me now so you

675
01:03:33,499 --> 01:03:38,212
can tell how beautiful my voice is.

676
01:03:41,257 --> 01:03:43,008
You think your voice
will be enough?

677
01:03:45,261 --> 01:03:46,512
Go on a hunger strike.

678
01:03:49,265 --> 01:03:53,310
Join in the strike, Eun-young.

679
01:04:06,782 --> 01:04:08,451
Steal Eun-young's voice for me.

680
01:04:09,201 --> 01:04:12,329
My flying socks are the second
most important thing to me.

681
01:04:12,955 --> 01:04:14,623
Next to my SK-ll cosmetics.

682
01:04:15,249 --> 01:04:16,625
Kyu-suk is mine.

683
01:04:19,462 --> 01:04:24,133
Can you tell me why you are
on a hunger strike?

684
01:04:26,552 --> 01:04:28,137
I think it's my fault.

685
01:04:29,555 --> 01:04:31,348
Please release Young-goon.

686
01:04:33,392 --> 01:04:35,519
Please release her soon.

687
01:04:35,978 --> 01:04:37,354
And you two stay apart!

688
01:04:39,273 --> 01:04:40,441
Everyone.

689
01:04:40,900 --> 01:04:44,028
Do you know why Young-goon
is in the stabilizing room?

690
01:04:44,653 --> 01:04:46,906
She hasn't eaten for
a long time

691
01:04:47,072 --> 01:04:49,116
and is very weak.

692
01:04:49,742 --> 01:04:54,538
So she has to eat under the careful
supervision of the staff.

693
01:04:57,750 --> 01:05:03,631
If she continues to starve
for 3 more days, Young-goon will die.

694
01:05:05,966 --> 01:05:07,927
Do you understand?

695
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:51,011
I told you taking food through
the nose tube would hurt.

696
01:05:51,762 --> 01:05:52,805
Let's.

697
01:05:56,976 --> 01:05:58,435
How delicious!

698
01:05:58,561 --> 01:06:01,939
Want to eat now without the tube?

699
01:06:26,171 --> 01:06:27,798
She says she doesn't want to eat!

700
01:06:29,341 --> 01:06:29,842
Let me go!

701
01:06:31,969 --> 01:06:33,637
She doesn't want to eat!

702
01:06:33,971 --> 01:06:35,139
Oh, my god! ll-soon!

703
01:06:36,056 --> 01:06:37,725
ll-soon, calm down.

704
01:06:38,559 --> 01:06:40,936
You can't force a patient
without their consent!

705
01:06:42,354 --> 01:06:45,357
She has the right not to eat!

706
01:06:53,782 --> 01:06:54,950
Young-goon!

707
01:06:56,493 --> 01:06:59,914
The vending machine says hi.

708
01:07:01,874 --> 01:07:10,341
Young-goon!

709
01:07:10,466 --> 01:07:11,842
Let her go!

710
01:07:14,178 --> 01:07:15,846
She doesn't want to eat.

711
01:07:18,682 --> 01:07:20,225
Let her go.

712
01:07:23,979 --> 01:07:25,856
She doesn't want to eat.

713
01:08:10,859 --> 01:08:12,027
Are you okay?

714
01:08:12,945 --> 01:08:14,321
I hope you didn't get hurt.

715
01:08:16,156 --> 01:08:19,535
Hold out your hand.

716
01:08:30,087 --> 01:08:31,547
Put them on

717
01:08:31,672 --> 01:08:35,259
Lie on your stomach with your
arms out and rub your feet hard.

718
01:08:36,677 --> 01:08:42,141
It makes static electrical tension
and makes your body float.

719
01:08:42,766 --> 01:08:44,101
You don't eat chicken, right?

720
01:08:44,852 --> 01:08:46,520
I'll start singing for you.

721
01:08:46,645 --> 01:08:49,648
When you start floating,
make yourself small.

722
01:08:50,149 --> 01:08:54,236
I went across the Switzerland
where all the yodlers be.

723
01:08:54,361 --> 01:08:58,032
I tried to run the mountains and they...

724
01:08:58,157 --> 01:09:01,744
I climb up in the mountains
when a clear sunny day

725
01:09:01,869 --> 01:09:05,456
I met a little Swiss girl
in a Swiss chalet.

726
01:09:05,581 --> 01:09:13,005
She taught me how to yodel.

727
01:09:13,172 --> 01:09:19,928
I will teach you how to yodel.

728
01:09:35,694 --> 01:09:39,239
I went across the Switzerland
where all the yodlers be

729
01:09:39,364 --> 01:09:43,035
I tried to run the mountains and they...

730
01:09:43,202 --> 01:09:46,705
I climb up in the mountains
when a clear sunny day.

731
01:09:46,872 --> 01:09:50,417
I met a little Swiss girl
in a Swiss chalet

732
01:09:50,542 --> 01:09:58,133
She taught me how to yodel.

733
01:09:58,258 --> 01:10:05,516
I will teach you how to yodel.

734
01:10:28,956 --> 01:10:31,208
This is the problem!

735
01:10:31,750 --> 01:10:33,127
Look at this face.

736
01:10:37,381 --> 01:10:39,550
It's natural men wouldn't
leave her alone.

737
01:10:48,892 --> 01:10:50,727
You're a cyborg, so you can't eat?

738
01:10:53,939 --> 01:10:55,816
You're a cyborg,
so you don't need to eat?

739
01:10:58,652 --> 01:11:00,612
I'll break down if I eat.

740
01:11:02,072 --> 01:11:03,448
Let's go and eat!

741
01:11:04,950 --> 01:11:07,119
Please, Young-goon?

742
01:11:07,578 --> 01:11:09,913
Come on

743
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:11,540
Let's eat! Why not?

744
01:11:12,374 --> 01:11:15,252
You're a cyborg but you can
still eat and be OK.

745
01:11:27,178 --> 01:11:28,805
Granny!

746
01:11:28,972 --> 01:11:32,725
Young-goon! My child!

747
01:11:32,850 --> 01:11:36,437
Young-goon!

748
01:11:42,860 --> 01:11:47,031
I didn't use them. I just held
them up to see how they looked.

749
01:11:50,702 --> 01:11:52,453
Your teeth will fall out.

750
01:11:53,496 --> 01:11:57,834
Use them only
when you really miss me.

751
01:12:00,044 --> 01:12:05,925
Look? My teeth all fell out
because of those dentures.

752
01:12:07,552 --> 01:12:12,140
You're lying! You didn't have any
in the first place!

753
01:12:15,393 --> 01:12:19,439
This confounded elastic band!

754
01:12:19,564 --> 01:12:22,358
My back is killing me.

755
01:12:22,483 --> 01:12:27,530
Young-goon, you have to let me go.

756
01:12:27,697 --> 01:12:30,033
Young-goon, my dear!

757
01:12:37,081 --> 01:12:40,209
Granny! Granny!

758
01:12:42,378 --> 01:12:43,755
The purpose of...

759
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:45,048
What?

760
01:12:46,382 --> 01:12:49,135
The purpose of existence is what?
Granny!

761
01:12:49,886 --> 01:12:52,430
Granny!

762
01:13:00,980 --> 01:13:03,066
She vanished into a dot.

763
01:13:05,652 --> 01:13:08,404
No being sad.

764
01:13:12,450 --> 01:13:17,246
She was cremated and
her ashes laid to rest.

765
01:13:19,666 --> 01:13:21,334
A week ago.

766
01:13:31,969 --> 01:13:37,058
I thought of you and
brought a spoonful.

767
01:13:43,356 --> 01:13:44,732
It's Granny.

768
01:14:00,081 --> 01:14:01,624
They got mixed up.

769
01:14:14,262 --> 01:14:15,430
Mom.

770
01:14:17,181 --> 01:14:18,933
It's Young-goon!

771
01:14:26,357 --> 01:14:30,653
You didn't tell the people here
you're a mouse, did you?

772
01:14:31,696 --> 01:14:36,159
I mean, a cybor, did you?

773
01:14:41,789 --> 01:14:45,209
You did... didn't you!

774
01:14:47,545 --> 01:14:51,007
How can you think only of yourself?

775
01:14:51,174 --> 01:14:56,554
A person can't just go around
saying everything they want to!

776
01:14:57,764 --> 01:14:58,931
Mom?

777
01:15:01,058 --> 01:15:02,226
Yes?

778
01:15:03,895 --> 01:15:06,230
There's something
I really want to say.

779
01:15:09,066 --> 01:15:10,234
What is it?

780
01:15:12,695 --> 01:15:14,530
Granny's dentures...

781
01:15:16,574 --> 01:15:18,701
You left them behind on purpose,
didn't you?

782
01:15:20,661 --> 01:15:23,122
So she couldn't eat radishes
at the sanitorium.

783
01:15:26,876 --> 01:15:35,343
Oh, woe, woe is me!

784
01:15:35,968 --> 01:15:42,558
Oh woe, woe is me!

785
01:16:01,786 --> 01:16:09,335
Oh woe, woe is me!

786
01:16:35,570 --> 01:16:39,031
Granny, I'm...

787
01:16:40,491 --> 01:16:47,456
I'm in a position where
being sad is forbidden...

788
01:19:18,482 --> 01:19:20,317
No restlessness.

789
01:19:23,571 --> 01:19:28,117
You have no energy because you let
Gop-dahn have all your food!

790
01:19:45,968 --> 01:19:47,636
White rice with...

791
01:19:49,263 --> 01:19:56,020
Plumes of steam coming up from it.

792
01:19:56,771 --> 01:19:59,440
No useless daydreaming
White winter rice...

793
01:19:59,565 --> 01:20:06,322
If a kebab comes along,
pull out the stick and eat it up.

794
01:20:10,576 --> 01:20:12,536
The persimmon spoke.

795
01:20:14,205 --> 01:20:16,332
I'm shy so...

796
01:20:16,707 --> 01:20:22,630
Please take me in one mouthful.

797
01:20:25,382 --> 01:20:31,639
Winter rice.
Granny's pickled radish.

798
01:20:33,682 --> 01:20:35,017
Spring rice.

799
01:20:36,185 --> 01:20:37,937
Summer rice.

800
01:20:39,480 --> 01:20:41,440
Fall rice.

801
01:20:59,875 --> 01:21:03,337
Silent rice.

802
01:21:04,088 --> 01:21:08,217
Holy rice.

803
01:21:09,093 --> 01:21:17,351
All is calm. All is rice.

804
01:21:18,102 --> 01:21:25,025
Round yon virgin mother and child.

805
01:21:26,152 --> 01:21:31,740
Eating noodles, tender and mild.

806
01:21:58,475 --> 01:22:00,102
Her looks are the problem.

807
01:22:01,061 --> 01:22:04,106
Oh, you heartbreaker!

808
01:22:17,661 --> 01:22:18,829
Young-goon?

809
01:22:19,079 --> 01:22:20,247
Young-goon!

810
01:22:23,292 --> 01:22:24,960
It's a rice-megatron.

811
01:22:26,170 --> 01:22:29,840
A device that converts food
calories into electrical energy.

812
01:22:30,799 --> 01:22:35,012
So when you eat rice,

813
01:22:35,179 --> 01:22:38,807
It'll compress and explode it

814
01:22:38,974 --> 01:22:40,643
into energy.

815
01:22:42,561 --> 01:22:45,439
Charging takes a long time.

816
01:22:45,564 --> 01:22:47,233
Food is best when you're in a hurry.

817
01:22:47,358 --> 01:22:51,153
Rice is sufficient for regular
everyday electric energy.

818
01:22:51,862 --> 01:22:54,156
Isn't it incredible?

819
01:23:07,461 --> 01:23:08,504
Here's the door.

820
01:23:09,755 --> 01:23:11,507
They're usually in back.

821
01:23:12,258 --> 01:23:13,425
Really?

822
01:23:17,263 --> 01:23:18,430
Now...

823
01:23:21,892 --> 01:23:23,644
Please remove your top.

824
01:23:23,769 --> 01:23:24,728
What?

825
01:23:28,399 --> 01:23:32,152
Please remove your top.

826
01:24:32,087 --> 01:24:34,965
I'll have to cut the skin
to open the door.

827
01:25:05,496 --> 01:25:06,622
I'm opening it.

828
01:25:10,167 --> 01:25:11,835
No wonder why.

829
01:25:13,003 --> 01:25:14,630
I get itchy there.

830
01:25:16,298 --> 01:25:20,427
It was because the door was there!

831
01:25:20,552 --> 01:25:24,640
It's open, so I'm putting in
my hand and attaching the device.

832
01:25:25,182 --> 01:25:26,225
Okay.

833
01:25:27,351 --> 01:25:28,519
I'm going in.

834
01:25:29,978 --> 01:25:32,439
Look at all that dust!

835
01:25:50,999 --> 01:25:55,337
I wish I could thank you
for all you've done.

836
01:25:56,380 --> 01:26:00,008
For stealthily stealing
my sympathy before, too.

837
01:26:01,969 --> 01:26:04,221
I'd like to, but...

838
01:26:05,055 --> 01:26:08,434
No thankfulness
I'm forbidden...

839
01:26:08,559 --> 01:26:11,437
by law to feel thankfulness.

840
01:26:25,367 --> 01:26:26,326
What?

841
01:26:26,452 --> 01:26:28,537
Pickled radish!

842
01:26:53,896 --> 01:26:57,566
One, hold the spoon
with your right hand.

843
01:27:05,657 --> 01:27:11,330
Two, take some rice
and bring it to your mouth.

844
01:27:19,588 --> 01:27:24,343
Three, open your mouth
and put the spoon in.

845
01:27:49,368 --> 01:27:51,245
What if I eat,

846
01:27:52,079 --> 01:27:54,623
And the rice-megatron doesn't work?

847
01:27:57,501 --> 01:28:00,629
I'll fix it.
I'm a technician, remember?

848
01:28:02,089 --> 01:28:06,009
Maybe not now, but what if it
breaks down later?

849
01:28:06,760 --> 01:28:08,220
Or after that?

850
01:28:11,557 --> 01:28:13,517
Call me.
I make house calls for repairs.

851
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:16,144
It's a warranty for life.

858
01:28:41,753 --> 01:28:45,716
Three, open your mouth
and put the spoon in.

859
01:29:10,490 --> 01:29:15,621
Four, close your mouth and
slowly pull the spoon out.

860
01:29:17,873 --> 01:29:19,041
Five.

861
01:29:19,875 --> 01:29:21,043
We're going to chew.

862
01:29:25,172 --> 01:29:28,425
Chew. Chew.

863
01:29:42,105 --> 01:29:43,231
Are you OK?

864
01:29:45,776 --> 01:29:48,528
Six, swallow.

865
01:29:56,870 --> 01:29:58,246
You can do it, Young-goon.

866
01:29:58,955 --> 01:30:04,628
When I count to five and snap,
you'll swallow.

867
01:30:05,671 --> 01:30:06,838
On five.

868
01:30:07,798 --> 01:30:09,132
Ready?

869
01:30:11,093 --> 01:30:12,260
One

870
01:30:15,180 --> 01:30:16,431
Two

871
01:30:18,767 --> 01:30:19,309
Three

872
01:32:27,479 --> 01:32:32,442
Granny liked listening to the radio.

873
01:32:33,860 --> 01:32:41,034
Me, too. I lose track of time
listening to the radio.

874
01:32:42,160 --> 01:32:48,625
But, she listened to
keep track of time.

875
01:32:50,961 --> 01:32:53,630
Because she was at home all day.

876
01:32:56,967 --> 01:33:02,264
We were listening to the 4:00 show
when mom came home.

877
01:33:03,682 --> 01:33:06,518
With my aunt and uncle.

878
01:33:12,566 --> 01:33:14,734
Young-goon, turn down the radio.

879
01:33:15,986 --> 01:33:17,320
What's that smell?

880
01:33:19,865 --> 01:33:22,117
For crying out loud!

881
01:33:24,369 --> 01:33:29,541
Eating radish all day,
of course it'd stink.

882
01:33:33,086 --> 01:33:35,755
I rest all day and come home to work

883
01:33:35,881 --> 01:33:37,340
with her here like this.

884
01:33:37,507 --> 01:33:41,011
I mean, work all day and
come home to rest.

885
01:33:41,177 --> 01:33:46,433
How could you bear living like this?

886
01:33:51,855 --> 01:33:54,858
Granny likes listening to the radio.

887
01:33:54,983 --> 01:33:56,818
She likes this one even more since...

888
01:33:56,985 --> 01:33:58,653
Her clever little Young-goon
made it for her.

889
01:33:58,778 --> 01:34:01,531
Mom, aunt, uncle! Shut up!

890
01:34:01,698 --> 01:34:03,325
We can't hear the radio.

891
01:34:04,576 --> 01:34:06,328
I said, turn down the radio!

892
01:34:06,494 --> 01:34:07,829
It's giving me a headache.

893
01:34:21,259 --> 01:34:24,721
Come on, the ambulance is waiting.

894
01:34:31,269 --> 01:34:34,022
We should have taken her to
the sanitarium way before!

895
01:34:45,951 --> 01:34:48,119
The purpose of existence is...

896
01:35:23,863 --> 01:35:25,115
Doctor?

897
01:35:26,574 --> 01:35:29,244
The secret of my existence.

898
01:35:31,579 --> 01:35:34,916
I have a secret
I'm not supposed to tell.

899
01:35:36,167 --> 01:35:38,253
Shall I tell you?

900
01:35:41,798 --> 01:35:46,428
The truth is, I'm...

901
01:36:05,989 --> 01:36:07,115
Young-goon.

902
01:36:09,367 --> 01:36:10,535
That tickles.

903
01:36:21,796 --> 01:36:24,174
So you're a cyborg, Young-goon!

904
01:36:27,552 --> 01:36:29,429
It must have been hard for you.

905
01:36:32,974 --> 01:36:36,519
It's okay, now I know.

906
01:36:37,479 --> 01:36:40,732
After knowing, trusting
is the more important thing.

907
01:36:41,357 --> 01:36:42,650
You trust me, right?

908
01:36:45,487 --> 01:36:49,949
But you know what's most important
after knowing and trusting?

909
01:36:52,077 --> 01:36:55,538
Eating. Eating food.

910
01:37:21,272 --> 01:37:22,440
Be?

911
01:37:23,483 --> 01:37:24,651
Me?

912
01:37:25,276 --> 01:37:26,444
Be?

913
01:37:27,403 --> 01:37:28,530
Nee?

914
01:37:29,405 --> 01:37:30,532
Nee!

915
01:37:30,782 --> 01:37:31,908
Knee.

916
01:37:34,577 --> 01:37:35,703
Next one.

917
01:37:41,084 --> 01:37:41,584
Da?

918
01:37:41,668 --> 01:37:42,836
A?

919
01:37:45,755 --> 01:37:48,049
Yo, Ra, A?

920
01:37:51,469 --> 01:37:52,428
A?

921
01:37:54,097 --> 01:37:55,140
Da?

922
01:37:56,391 --> 01:37:58,226
- Da?
- Da!

923
01:38:03,898 --> 01:38:08,611
You're a nuke bomb your purpose
zov existence zis...

924
01:38:09,362 --> 01:38:13,241
World zend.

925
01:38:13,366 --> 01:38:15,535
Knee da billion bolts.

926
01:38:19,789 --> 01:38:20,832
You're a nuke bomb.

927
01:38:20,957 --> 01:38:22,625
A nuke bomb?

928
01:38:23,293 --> 01:38:25,336
Purpose of existence zis..

929
01:38:28,089 --> 01:38:29,340
Zis...

930
01:38:32,886 --> 01:38:35,847
Purpose of existence is.

931
01:38:37,307 --> 01:38:41,019
World zend.

932
01:38:42,645 --> 01:38:47,817
Need a billion volts.

933
01:38:47,984 --> 01:38:52,030
Billion volts?
Need a billion volts. Nuke bomb.

934
01:38:56,576 --> 01:38:58,036
What's a zend?

935
01:39:01,873 --> 01:39:03,958
Who's Zend?

936
01:39:07,295 --> 01:39:08,463
Shut up!

937
01:39:44,958 --> 01:39:46,626
Perfect weather, isn't it?

938
01:39:51,673 --> 01:39:54,342
You shouldn't throw trash away
just anywhere.

939
01:40:03,059 --> 01:40:04,352
Why not?

940
01:40:07,188 --> 01:40:09,148
It'll all be over once I blow up.

941
01:40:10,483 --> 01:40:11,150
You're a nuke bomb. Your purpose of
existence is the world's end.

942
01:40:11,276 --> 01:40:11,943
Need a billion volts.

943
01:40:12,068 --> 01:40:14,862
Why would a young lady
like you blow up?

944
01:40:15,697 --> 01:40:17,365
We must carry on living
through thick and thin.

945
01:40:27,875 --> 01:40:30,420
Come on, hurry up!

946
01:40:42,890 --> 01:40:46,436
Think there's really a billion volts
in one bolt of lightening?

947
01:40:55,862 --> 01:41:01,909
Round yon virgin.

948
01:41:02,076 --> 01:41:05,330
Eating noodles.

949
01:41:06,289 --> 01:41:07,332
It's cold.

950
01:41:12,462 --> 01:41:13,755
The persimmon.

951
01:41:19,469 --> 01:41:21,262
The rice.

952
01:41:24,182 --> 01:41:26,517
Have you seen the cork for this?

953
01:41:26,768 --> 01:41:29,312
The person who throws away paper

954
01:41:29,479 --> 01:41:31,022
and gum any place probably lost it.

955
01:41:31,147 --> 01:41:32,732
What's he talking about?

956
01:41:34,984 --> 01:41:39,113
The precious wine got rain in it!

957
01:41:53,086 --> 01:41:54,337
What a waste!

958
01:42:05,473 --> 01:42:07,225
What if it doesn't hit me?

959
01:42:07,850 --> 01:42:09,018
Huh?

960
01:42:10,770 --> 01:42:15,316
Just, give up hope and...

961
01:42:27,078 --> 01:42:28,162
Let's keep our strength up!

962
01:42:40,258 --> 01:42:41,634
What do we do now?

963
01:42:44,178 --> 01:42:46,222
Let's just take off
our wet socks anyway.

964
01:43:37,273 --> 01:43:39,609
But they're not the only things wet.

965
01:43:58,878 --> 01:44:00,421
More than our socks are wet.
