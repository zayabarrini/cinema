1
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Dialogues subtitled in white are Korean.
<font color="#ffff00">Dialogues subtitled in yellow are Japanese.</font>

2
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,371
<font color="#ffff00">You little brats, beat it!</font>

3
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,521
Hey!

4
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,688
It should have been me!

5
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:26,602
I should be the one
going to that Jap's house.

6
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,362
You'll miss the train.

7
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,561
Hurry.

8
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:45,287
'PART ONE'

9
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,288
<font color="#ffff00">'Kouzuki Noriaki'</font>

10
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,163
<font color="#ffff00">Go back to sleep.</font>

11
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,407
<font color="#ffff00">We're still far from the house.</font>

12
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,401
<font color="#ffff00">Pleased to meet you. I am Okju.</font>

13
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,443
This property has three buildings.

14
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,608
A Western-style wing by
an English architect

15
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,684
and a Japanese wing form the main house.

16
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,766
Not even in Japan is there
a building combining two styles.

17
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:24,410
It reﬂects Master's
admiration for Japan and England.

18
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,325
Next is the annex

19
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,325
which Master had furnished as a library.

20
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,885
Last, the servants' quarters.

21
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,606
As the Lady's handmaiden,
you won't sleep there.

22
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,282
You may eat her leftover food,

23
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,642
but tea leaves go to the kitchen girls.

24
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,321
Used soap is for the steward.

25
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,166
Anyone caught pilfering
is expelled that day.

26
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,482
I'm sure you wouldn't dare, Tamako.

27
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,161
Huh.

28
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,924
"Tamako" is you.
Your name is Okju in Japanese.

29
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,685
We live in the Japanese style here.

30
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,601
Speak Japanese to the Master and Lady.

31
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,960
- Call me Sasaki.
- Yes, ma'am.

32
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,882
I don't trust new servants.

33
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,048
Even if they make a good impression,

34
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,364
if the house burns down, they'll
run away with a manuscript.

35
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,289
The Lady's routine is simple.

36
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:27,564
Taking a walk, or reading for Master.

37
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,805
Among the richest men,
Master is the greatest book lover.

38
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,764
And among book lovers, he is the richest.

39
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,049
His ties to the colonial government
even let us use electricity.

40
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,286
In such a home,

41
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,249
you know what's expected
of a maid like you?

42
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,367
Don't be alarmed at the blackouts.

43
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,761
I sleep in here?

44
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,564
Miss Hideko wakes easily
on account of her nerves.

45
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,491
She's behind this door?

46
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,561
Shh!

47
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,086
<font color="#ffff00">Mother!</font>

48
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,565
<font color="#ffff00">Mother!</font>

49
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,765
<font color="#ffff00">Mother!</font>

50
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,961
<font color="#ffff00">Miss!</font>

51
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,128
<font color="#ffff00">Miss, are you alright?</font>

52
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,484
<font color="#ffff00">Junko! Is that you?</font>

53
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,841
<font color="#ffff00">Junko was kicked out, Miss.
I'm the new girl.</font>

54
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,486
<font color="#ffff00">Seems you had a bad dream.</font>

55
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,965
<font color="#ffff00">You see that big cherry tree?</font>

56
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:57,440
<font color="#ffff00">My aunt went mad and
hanged herself there.</font>

57
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,928
<font color="#ffff00">Sometimes on moonless nights,</font>

58
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,764
<font color="#ffff00">my aunt's ghost</font>

59
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:06,447
<font color="#ffff00">dangles from that branch.</font>

60
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,809
<font color="#ffff00">Here, drink up.</font>

61
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:29,964
<font color="#ffff00">When babies cry, my auntie feeds them a spoonful of sake.</font>

62
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:38,605
<i>Sweet bird, sweet bird</i>

63
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,324
<i>My sweet bluebird</i>

64
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:52,407
<i>What scent is this that fills my nose?</i>

65
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,643
- What?
- Coming back from the toilet,

66
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,644
I saw a light going down the hallway.

67
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,124
That's it! They're meeting in her room.

68
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,731
Or else it's the ghost
of the cherry tree?

69
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,241
Those fuckers.

70
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,450
<font color="#ffff00">This is Tamako.</font>

71
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,331
<font color="#ffff00">I am at your service.
Miss...</font>

72
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,609
<font color="#ffff00">A reference letter
from Lady Minami, my last mistress.</font>

73
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,251
<font color="#ffff00">So is this place to your liking?</font>

74
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:58,245
<font color="#ffff00">The sun scarcely ever shines here.</font>

75
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,368
<font color="#ffff00">Uncle won't permit it.</font>

76
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,051
<font color="#ffff00">Sunlight causes books to fade.</font>

77
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,691
<font color="#ffff00">One could never grow fond of
such a dreary place.</font>

78
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,367
<font color="#ffff00">Not a good liar, are you?</font>

79
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:20,403
<font color="#ffff00">We look a bit alike.</font>

80
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,844
<font color="#ffff00">Are you also an orphan?</font>

81
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,451
<font color="#ffff00">- Uh...
- I'll take my leave.</font>

82
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,290
<font color="#ffff00">Whereas in my case,
my aunt and Mrs. Sasaki</font>

83
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:35,967
<font color="#ffff00">showed me how the love
of a mother...</font>

84
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,120
isn't worth a thing.

85
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,528
My head aches
before every reading practice.

86
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,805
Would you read it to me?

87
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:58,927
<font color="#ffff00">Pardon?</font>

88
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,051
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, how kind of her.</font>

89
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,841
<font color="#ffff00">Lady Minami said
such nice things about me!</font>

90
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,490
Is that so?

91
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:23,321
<font color="#ffff00">Miss, you're a Japanese lady,< /br>
why don't you speak Japanese?</font>

92
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,881
I'm sick of it.

93
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,249
The books he makes me read
are all Japanese.

94
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,527
So read that for me.

95
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,766
<font color="#ffff00">"Dear Miss Izumi Hideko,"</font>

96
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:50,684
<font color="#ffff00">"Count Fujiwara said
you're looking for a maid."</font>

97
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:53,241
<font color="#ffff00">"Maids are like..."</font>

98
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,249
<font color="#ffff00">"a spoon..."  no...</font>

99
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,884
<font color="#ffff00">"...are like chopsticks..."</font>

100
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,327
<font color="#ffff00">Or is it a spoon?</font>

101
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,887
I don't know how to read, Miss.

102
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,205
Not at all? What about Korean?

103
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,044
This is your name.

104
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,844
Can't you read it?

105
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,002
Reading can be learned,

106
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,801
and I don't care if you curse or steal.

107
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,560
But don't ever lie to me. Understood?

108
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,290
Yes, Miss.

109
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,331
My mom.

110
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,365
She's beautiful, quite the charmer!

111
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,565
And me? Am I also "quite the charmer"?

112
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,401
Everyone says I can't compare to my mother.

113
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,281
Count Fujiwara said...

114
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,883
So you've met the Count?

115
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,322
Pardon?

116
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,562
No, I never met him...

117
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:51,089
My aunt! I heard it from my aunt.

118
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,561
She was his nanny.

119
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,241
What did the Count say about me?

120
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,127
He said your face...

121
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,128
Every night in bed he
thinks of your assets...

122
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,765
Your face.

123
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,011
Why in bed, I wonder?

124
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,289
What's with your foot?

125
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,210
I've nowhere to go.

126
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,324
I've just stayed in this house
since coming to Korea at age 5.

127
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:34,440
But in new shoes,
even well-trodden paths feel fresh.

128
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,607
The ones from here

129
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,001
up to here should fit you.

130
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,046
Why not the prettiest ones?
Like these?

131
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,688
Time for reading practice.

132
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,851
I'll go alone.

133
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,922
Miss? But rain is falling.

134
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:14,643
At noon, come knock on the door.

135
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,161
Promise?

136
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,805
See you at...

137
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,326
What's this?

138
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,365
<font color="#ffff00">My new handmaiden.</font>

139
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,200
<font color="#ffff00">The snake, the snake!</font>

140
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,405
<font color="#ffff00">You mustn't pass that point.</font>

141
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,084
<font color="#ffff00">Be warned!</font>

142
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,650
<font color="#ffff00">The snake marks the
'bounds of knowledge'.</font>

143
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,967
He has the habit of licking his plume
when he thinks,

144
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,162
otherwise he's someone clean.

145
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,963
What kind of servant would
hog the umbrella like you?

146
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,042
Pardon?

147
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,601
Miss!

148
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,327
Miss!

149
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,842
<i>These books make me sick.</i>

150
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,082
They bore me to death.

151
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,162
Do you read so many books?

152
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,170
You'll become a professor
in no time then.

153
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,563
I'm sorry.

154
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,610
I won't do it again.

155
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,361
Pardon.

156
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,565
The Count?

157
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,366
Today?

158
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:47,411
That's why you insisted on a bath.

159
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:50,131
My aunt, when she heard
a guest was coming,

160
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:53,443
dropped everything
and bathed her baby, Miss.

161
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:58,482
Nothing made her happier than
when guests praised her baby's scent.

162
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,888
You are my baby, Miss.

163
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,090
Auntie gave the babies candy during baths.

164
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,811
To teach them that bath time is sweet.

165
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,610
What's wrong?

166
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,646
One of my teeth is sharp.
It keeps cutting me.

167
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,248
<i>So this was the scent.</i>

168
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,204
All smooth.

169
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,209
<font color="#ffff00">Welcome, sir!</font>

170
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,530
<font color="#ffff00">You are too kind to greet me
this way upon my arrival</font>

171
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:37,968
<font color="#ffff00">when the journey
has left me so unkempt.</font>

172
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,680
<font color="#ffff00">Now your tedium is over.</font>

173
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:44,164
<font color="#ffff00">I'll ensure your
painting lessons are stimulating.</font>

174
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,526
<font color="#ffff00">This must be Okju.</font>

175
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,121
<font color="#ffff00">At your service, milord.</font>

176
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:56,245
<font color="#ffff00">You know if you fail, it'll put me in an awkward position?</font>

177
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:01,044
<font color="#ffff00">A decent bone
structure for a Korean...</font>

178
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:05,646
<font color="#ffff00">So, are you carrying out
your duties faithfully?</font>

179
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,326
<font color="#ffff00">Thank you for your recommendation.</font>

180
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:13,168
<font color="#ffff00">You chose a perfect servant for me.</font>

181
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:19,247
<font color="#ffff00">You wouldn't want one who's too stupid.
I did my best.</font>

182
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:23,403
<font color="#ffff00">Take good care of our dear Lady.</font>

183
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:25,761
<font color="#ffff00">Take this.</font>

184
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,170
<font color="#ffff00">Count Fujiwara requests Miss Hideko
to kindly allow her maid Tamako</font>

185
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:52,841
<font color="#ffff00">to be sent to his Lordship
for a brief errand.</font>

186
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,569
<font color="#ffff00">- Did you call for me, milord?
- You may enter.</font>

187
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,608
<font color="#ffff00">Do you think you can fool me with this?</font>

188
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,250
<font color="#ffff00">Who do you take me for?</font>

189
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:58,401
<i>You think I'm Tamako,
a poor Korean handmaiden.</i>

190
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:01,808
<i>But my real name's Nam Sook-hee.</i>

191
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:08,206
<i>Raised by Miss Boksun,
top purveyor of stolen goods.</i>

192
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:12,410
<i>I was able at age 5
to tell a real coin from a fake.</i>

193
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:15,650
<i>Then learned to forge stamps from Gugai,</i>

194
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:19,446
<i>and studied pickpocketing from Kutan,</i>

195
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,647
<i>but these babies will never
learn such useful skills.</i>

196
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,527
<i>Abandoned as newborns,</i>

197
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,968
<i>we'll wash and feed them,
then sell them to Japan.</i>

198
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,209
<i>Such meaningful work.</i>

199
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,802
<i>Instead of starving, they grow up
gentlemen and ladies.</i>

200
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:42,691
<i>Kutan only breastfeeds her own kid.
I wouldn't be so miserly.</i>

201
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:47,647
<i>I wish my breasts gave milk.
I'd breastfeed all of them.</i>

202
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,530
Milord!

203
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,962
I'll tell you the story of an interpreter,

204
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:38,091
who bribed his way into
translating for high officials.

205
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:42,570
After helping Japan annex Korea,
he got rights to a gold mine.

206
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:46,644
Now he wants to turn fully Japanese.

207
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,608
So he gets naturalized,

208
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:53,922
marries the daughter
of a fallen Japanese noble,

209
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:58,245
and adopts his wife's family name Kouzuki.

210
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,566
Ba... ba... bas...

211
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:08,361
Bastard builds a mansion,
fills it with books and antiques.

212
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:14,046
He invites Japanese
collectors to his library,

213
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:18,404
holds readings of rare books,
and auctions the books off.

214
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,370
He loves books and paintings
like his own flesh,

215
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,329
but he can't help parting with a few.

216
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,967
What to do, when he must sell,
but can't bear to?

217
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,929
He sells a fake.

218
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:37,210
He seeks out a specialist
to create intricate forgeries.

219
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,282
Unlike him, this specialist...

220
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:42,164
<font color="#ffff00">is a real Japanese, of noble birth!</font>

221
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:47,169
<font color="#ffff00">Count Fujiwara from Nagoya!</font>

222
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:51,762
<font color="#ffff00">So, who is this?</font>

223
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:56,010
It's the wife. His Japanese wife.

224
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,925
- You'll seduce her...
- Is she pretty?

225
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:02,964
The Jap wife died ages
ago with no children.

226
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:08,048
But the dead wife's
dead sister's living daughter

227
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,570
performs those book readings.

228
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,766
But is she pretty?

229
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,091
An orphan. Her father was rich.

230
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:18,051
Soon she'll fall in love with me,
and we'll elope to Japan.

231
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,243
After marrying her there,

232
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:24,564
and inheriting her fortune,
I'll declare her insane

233
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,728
and lock her up in a madhouse.

234
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,041
Right!

235
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:36,049
Sook-hee will be my mouse,
work as her maid, eavesdrop on her,

236
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:42,291
stay by her side and gently
persuade her to fall in love.

237
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,727
<i>Love?</i>

238
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,801
<i>What does a crook know about love?</i>

239
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:55,409
What of her fortune? She's rich?

240
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,891
Each night in bed
I think of her assets.

241
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,290
1.5 million in cash. 300,000 in bonds.

242
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:09,762
The uncle is just a guardian.
It's Hideko's fortune.

243
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:13,600
That's why Kouzuki
schemes to marry the girl.

244
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,607
To his w... wife's niece?

245
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,926
What a s... sick f... f...

246
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,485
Right, a sick fuck.

247
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,447
So what's our share?

248
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,844
I'll share 50,000.

249
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,928
Sook-hee gets the dresses and jewelry.

250
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,802
<font color="#ffff00">I'll do it! Take me!</font>

251
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:35,282
<font color="#ffff00">My Japanese is better and
I worked as a maid!</font>

252
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,524
On top of the fifty,

253
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:56,525
I get dresses, jewelry and my own 100,000.

254
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:01,809
B...b...beautiful!

255
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:04,884
I'm flummoxed in your presence!

256
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:09,444
If you stutter like that
and make your face go red,

257
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,321
those uppity bitches will feel superior,

258
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,289
and then they'll open up to you, all right?

259
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,051
Watch how to make your face blush:

260
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:21,046
Breathe in deep and
squeeze your stomach tight,

261
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,204
lower your chin
and contract your asshole,

262
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,761
don't breath, and swallow
your saliva ten times.

263
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,207
Got it?

264
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,042
Go ahead.

265
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:48,443
<font color="#ffff00">The blue kimono
with the white peonies,</font>

266
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,001
<font color="#ffff00">or the black one with
the drawings of cranes?</font>

267
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,080
The shit-colored one with caterpillars,

268
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,527
or the caterpillar-colored one
with drawings of shit?

269
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,761
Don't ask her opinion!

270
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,480
Questions make her think.

271
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,441
You're the one who should be
thinking for her!

272
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:07,490
That's how you dominate your mistress,
got it?

273
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,041
<font color="#ffff00">Yes.</font>

274
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,960
Here's the letter. Pay attention.

275
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,883
"Dear Miss lzumi Hideko,"

276
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:26,001
"Count Fujiwara has informed me of
your urgent need for a maid."

277
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:29,643
"A maid is like a pair of chopsticks."

278
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:33,964
"You hardly notice them, but their
absence plunges you into disarray."

279
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,165
Did my mom cry before they hanged her?

280
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,124
Women who steal once

281
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:47,287
and are hanged always cry.

282
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,329
They even cry a lot.

283
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:55,011
Your mother stole a thousand times,

284
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:59,165
was caught just once, and died once.

285
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,171
Did she cry?

286
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,369
She laughed.

287
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,406
Said she was lucky to
have you before dying.

288
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:14,531
That she had no regrets.

289
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:20,204
Imagine what a good
thief you'll become!

290
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,367
It should have been me!

291
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:38,967
I should be the one
going to that Jap's house.

292
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,562
What a pity...

293
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,682
Everyone's talking about you in Eunpo.

294
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,204
How you'll be an even
greater thief than your mom. Hmm?

295
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:01,126
Who believes the talk of a swindler?

296
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:06,442
When I give the signal,
<font color="#ffff00">"fully ripe,"</font>

297
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,602
arrange for her and I to be alone.

298
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,603
Then I'll gobble her up to the pit.

299
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:14,924
She's so naive,
even if a man pulls on her nipples

300
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,331
she won't know what he wants.

301
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:22,722
So it's your job to tell her
that everything is because of me.

302
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,331
<font color="#ffff00">"Oh my, since the Count arrived,</font>

303
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:29,125
<font color="#ffff00">your toenails are growing much faster!"</font>

304
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:32,567
That sort of thing, all right?

305
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,290
Here, a gift.

306
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,691
Oh, he's so thoughtful!

307
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:54,089
<i>That'll be mine when
she goes to the madhouse.</i>

308
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:58,242
<i>It pains my heart to see this poor girl.</i>

309
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:01,284
Have you ever seen sapphires so blue?

310
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,924
Let's take a look...

311
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:12,360
This isn't a sapphire, it's blue spinel.

312
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,964
It's all right, Miss.
Spinels are expensive, too.

313
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,205
How do you know...

314
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,483
Oh, my Auntie...
I mean, Lady Minami taught me.

315
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,730
But it's fine!

316
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,364
No need to be ashamed at all.

317
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,966
Your average fence
can barely tell them apart.

318
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,610
Is that so?

319
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:50,804
<i>Of all the things
I've washed and dressed,</i>

320
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,807
<i>has anything been this pretty?</i>

321
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,491
<i>I'd like to show her to the people at home.</i>

322
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:00,721
<i>What would they say?</i>

323
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,050
<i>Probably this?</i>

324
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,201
<font color="#ffff00">Mesmerizing!</font>

325
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:13,251
<font color="#ffff00">S...s...spellbindingly beautiful!</font>

326
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:20,926
<i>Shameless bastard.</i>

327
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:29,805
The Count kept pushing wine on me.

328
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,721
<i>Does it feel okay?</i>

329
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:42,242
It's suffocating.
How do ladies wear such things?

330
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,451
You think this is suffocating?

331
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,368
Miss, you're killing me!

332
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,650
Dressed up,
you look like a lady, too.

333
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,089
I think I know

334
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,562
what the Count meant.

335
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,044
Your face...

336
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,249
Each night in bed,

337
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,408
I think of your face.

338
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,444
Don't be silly, Miss.

339
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:30,411
<i>Ladies truly are the dolls of maids.</i>

340
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:35,443
<i>All these buttons are for my amusement.</i>

341
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:39,085
<i>If I undo the buttons
and pull out the cords,</i>

342
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:43,728
<i>then, the sweet things within,</i>

343
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:47,251
<i>those sweet and soft things...</i>

344
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:53,888
<i>if I were still a pickpocket,
I'd slip my hand inside...</i>

345
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,442
Miss, are you truly
going to marry your uncle?

346
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:38,689
That's what he raised me for,
knowing he'd need my fortune.

347
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,647
There's a famous collector in France.

348
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:45,048
He'll be putting his entire library
up for auction.

349
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:48,084
The gold mine's proceeds
won't cover the cost.

350
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:54,326
If it were me, I'd sell books
to buy gold, not the opposite.

351
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:59,529
Did you ever think of
marrying someone else?

352
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,001
- Count Fujiwara for example...
- You!

353
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:05,004
You're quite curious for a servant.

354
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,687
<i>For now,</i>

355
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:39,002
<i>the Lady needn't go read to the sick fuck
who wants to marry his wife's niece.</i>

356
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:45,767
<i>Instead the fake Count goes
to the library to make fake books.</i>

357
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:52,966
<i>The Lady waits for her 2 o'clock art class,</i>

358
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,445
<i>and waits...</i>

359
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,007
<i>Poor girl,</i>

360
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,890
<i>losing her heart to a fake.</i>

361
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,611
<font color="#ffff00">Please, Count!</font>

362
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,251
<font color="#ffff00">Sorry to be late.</font>

363
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,087
<font color="#ffff00">It's no matter.</font>

364
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:46,684
<font color="#ffff00">Maybe I need more practice
to give it dimensionality?</font>

365
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:49,286
<font color="#ffff00">Dimensionality... perhaps.</font>

366
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:53,331
<font color="#ffff00">Nonetheless, you have a vision
that transcends mere skill.</font>

367
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:57,160
<font color="#ffff00">As if you see directly into
an object's essence.</font>

368
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:02,731
<font color="#ffff00">For example, the fact that
this peach contains a lot of water.</font>

369
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,286
<font color="#ffff00">I hesitate to stand before you</font>

370
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,971
<font color="#ffff00">for fear that you
might read my thoughts.</font>

371
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,683
<font color="#ffff00">That's enough for today.</font>

372
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,485
<font color="#ffff00">Almost fully ripe.</font>

373
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:34,921
<i>Already?</i>

374
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,561
<i>Damn...</i>

375
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,846
Do you know what?

376
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:49,561
Since the Count arrived,
your cheeks have grown ﬂushed.

377
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:50,647
Have they?

378
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,851
How did your mom die?

379
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:06,166
When I was a baby,
at a big house, she was hanged...

380
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:10,171
- I mean, she hanged...
- Hanged herself? Like my aunt.

381
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,688
Well, pretty much.

382
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:24,729
Still, while alive she hugged you a lot?

383
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:33,011
My mother died giving birth to me.

384
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:41,004
So it's as if I strangled her myself.

385
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,690
I wish I'd never been born.

386
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,849
No baby is ever guilty of being born.

387
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:55,767
If your mother thought
you could understand,

388
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:58,366
this is what she'd have said.

389
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:03,331
That she was so lucky
to have you before dying.

390
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,568
That she had no regrets.

391
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:14,407
Wait here a moment, Miss.

392
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:16,407
I'll go pick mushrooms.

393
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:21,730
We'll have mushroom stew tonight,
you like that.

394
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,524
I'll go with you.

395
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:25,850
I'll be quick.

396
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,210
Before it rains.

397
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:38,447
Good girl...

398
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:45,651
<font color="#ffff00">What a coincidence.</font>

399
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:47,207
<font color="#ffff00">Indeed.</font>

400
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:49,284
<font color="#ffff00">May I sit by you?</font>

401
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:19,290
<i>The lady sits, shy and trembling.</i>

402
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:22,005
<i>The gentleman is persistent.</i>

403
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:26,685
<i>The perceptive maid
has stepped out for a moment.</i>

404
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,728
<i>All is well, Sook-hee.</i>

405
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:33,883
<i>Everyone's performing
their roles so damned well.</i>

406
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:36,726
<i>Fucking hell.</i>

407
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,971
You know servants can't use this entrance!

408
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:54,481
Hey!

409
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:02,451
<i>I wish I'd never come here.</i>

410
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:07,322
<i>It was wrong to come.</i>

411
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:12,124
<font color="#ffff00">Tamako, you brought
watercolors, right?</font>

412
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,643
<font color="#ffff00">Of course, milord!</font>

413
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:16,170
<font color="#ffff00">Watercolour paints and brushes...</font>

414
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:18,282
<font color="#ffff00">Go and get the oils.</font>

415
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:21,927
<font color="#ffff00">A day like this demands oils, yes!</font>

416
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,041
Shit!

417
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,450
<font color="#ffff00">Lady!</font>

418
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:56,010
<font color="#ffff00">Milord!</font>

419
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:11,405
Lady.

420
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:35,001
<font color="#ffff00">A blackout! Bring a lantern.</font>

421
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:56,605
<i>I need to think.</i>

422
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:59,607
<i>I need to become rich,</i>

423
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:04,202
<i>sail off to a distant harbor,
eat food I scarcely recognize,</i>

424
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:07,323
<i>buy my fill of glittering baubles,</i>

425
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:09,402
<i>and not think of Hideko.</i>

426
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:12,728
<i>Never think of Hideko...</i>

427
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,926
I returned
and you didn't even come to me?

428
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:46,604
It was late, I must have slept.
My apologies.

429
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:51,050
You know how hard it is
to do those readings?

430
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:55,242
Must I remove makeup
and change clothes all by myself?

431
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:58,686
I feel a nightmare coming. Sleep here.

432
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:26,168
He proposed to me.

433
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:31,004
Next full moon,

434
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:36,842
when my uncle visits his mine,
he wants to elope to Japan.

435
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:41,162
What did you say?

436
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:45,683
I said I wasn't sure.

437
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:46,767
Why?

438
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:48,850
I'm scared.

439
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:51,483
Of your uncle's anger?

440
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:55,248
Of the Count.

441
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:59,844
What's to be scared of? He's so kind.

442
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:05,044
I don't know, I just feel it.

443
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:11,489
Like the reflex of pulling
your hand from a flame.

444
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:16,882
Tell me...

445
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:27,001
What is it that men want?

446
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:31,401
Pardon?

447
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:36,440
I mean, after getting married,
at night...

448
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:42,930
How would I know?
I'm practically a child.

449
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:47,005
With no mother. No one here to...

450
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:53,921
First,

451
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:58,004
I guess they'd kiss?

452
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,206
And then?

453
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:06,004
They hug each other.

454
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:07,925
Standing up?

455
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:12,009
When there's no bed or
they have to be quick.

456
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:15,004
Normally one does it on a bed.

457
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:19,845
Let yourself go without thinking.
It'll work itself out.

458
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,240
Without thinking?

459
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:29,801
Are there girls who feel nothing

460
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:34,210
like how blind people don't see?

461
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:37,889
<i>What the hell.</i>

462
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:40,361
<i>I'll show her one thing,
then put her to bed.</i>

463
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:43,761
<i>Poor thing,</i>

464
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:50,649
<i>alone in a strange country,
reading those useless books,</i>

465
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:53,891
<i>without learning a single useful skill.</i>

466
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:13,920
<i>Why does the candy taste different?</i>

467
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:18,369
<i>The bitter turned sour,</i>

468
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:21,922
<i>the sour turned sweet,</i>

469
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,482
<i>the sweet turned savory...</i>

470
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:27,568
How do you know all this?

471
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:30,648
You must have experience?

472
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:35,685
My friend Kutan taught me.

473
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:38,688
Taught you? In words?

474
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:41,328
Yes, only in words.

475
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,802
So this is how it feels.

476
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:05,491
That's what you will feel for the Count.

477
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:07,721
Really?

478
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:10,004
The Count, truly...

479
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:15,770
He won't think he's
making love to a corpse?

480
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:20,042
You know about my cold hands and feet.

481
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:21,881
Really?

482
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:23,847
Here.

483
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:34,089
Feels just fine.

484
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:35,721
You like it?

485
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:40,643
Do it to me. I want to know how it feels.

486
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,971
I'm sure he'll want to do this too.

487
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:50,801
And then...

488
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:59,763
It's so cute.

489
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:04,522
If the Count sees this...

490
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:17,564
Will he really be so tender as this?

491
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:19,680
Of course.

492
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:22,769
And he'll touch you like this.

493
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,802
And like this...

494
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:30,770
Keep doing it like the Count would.

495
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:36,250
And this is what he'll say.

496
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,004
<font color="#ffff00">It's so soft, warm,</font>

497
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,002
<font color="#ffff00">wet and...</font>

498
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:50,963
<font color="#ffff00">s..s..spellbindingly beautiful!</font>

499
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,241
<i>Okju.</i>

500
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:17,804
<i>Hideko.</i>

501
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:23,160
<i>Mommy.</i>

502
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:27,002
<i>Daddy.</i>

503
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:31,371
<font color="#ffff00">Now, the model must stay still.</font>

504
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:35,727
Okju.

505
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:43,129
- Hideko...
<font color="#ffff00">- Wait.</font>

506
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:44,806
<font color="#ffff00">Stop.</font>

507
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:49,680
<i>...doesn't like it, you damned scoundrel!</i>

508
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:52,486
<font color="#ffff00">Stop it!</font>

509
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:53,601
<font color="#ffff00">I can't do this.</font>

510
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:59,364
<font color="#ffff00">Come here, Tamako.</font>

511
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:04,730
<font color="#ffff00">Find some other job to do.</font>

512
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:06,484
<font color="#ffff00">You catch my meaning?</font>

513
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:18,128
<font color="#ffff00">I've no other job to do.</font>

514
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:21,448
<font color="#ffff00">My job is to look after the Lady.</font>

515
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:36,009
I spit it out without chewing!
All because of you!

516
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:38,042
She's fully ripe! Fully ripe!

517
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:39,730
If I miss this fortnight, I'm finished!

518
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:43,601
Can you feel it? How much I want it?

519
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:48,288
After fighting so hard to escape
my garbage heap of a life,

520
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:51,929
you think I'll let you
fuck it up, you bitch?

521
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:57,446
Shall I tell the Lady
you're nothing but a lowly pickpocket?

522
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:01,127
Fine, I'll have something to tell her too.

523
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:05,524
That you're nothing but the son
of a lowly Korean farmhand and shaman...

524
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:06,607
Sook-hee.

525
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:08,887
Think of your family at home.

526
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:13,006
Boksun raising babies with her bad back
with those two halfwits.

527
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:15,651
How will they feel
if you go home empty-handed?

528
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:17,643
Want to shit on your mother's legend?

529
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:19,921
You should go home in glory.

530
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,686
So don't push Hideko too hard.

531
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:30,046
She's got no one on this earth.

532
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:33,841
If you frighten her,
she'll close up hard as a clam.

533
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:37,811
And please...

534
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:44,924
Don't ever again put my hand
on your tiny joke of a cock.

535
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:54,481
Oh, my.

536
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:58,328
Your toenails have grown faster
since the Count arrived.

537
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:00,209
How curious.

538
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:05,171
Miss, doesn't it bother you not to know?

539
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:09,443
How many ships sail on the wide sea...

540
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,526
People leaving, people returning,

541
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:15,571
those saying "Farewell" or "Welcome back."

542
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:18,086
What's the farthest you've traveled?

543
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:19,730
The hill beyond the manor?

544
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:30,403
My uncle would follow me
to the ends of the Earth.

545
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:35,280
I've always lived like this.

546
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:41,730
I could be content here,
if you were with me.

547
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:49,604
We go for walks
wearing new shoes,

548
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:51,609
you tell me stories,

549
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:57,685
and you massage my feet like that.

550
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,968
You're fortunate, Miss.

551
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:06,331
The man who loves you
has the power to protect you.

552
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:08,328
That's rare.

553
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:12,965
But I'm not sure if I love him.

554
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:16,050
You do love him.

555
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:20,885
How do you know?

556
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:24,967
You stare out the window all day.

557
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:27,962
Turn in your sleep and sigh.

558
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:32,045
And your toenails.

559
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:34,162
Even if I say I don't love him,

560
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:38,044
if I say that I love someone else...

561
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:43,645
Me, who has no one on this earth...

562
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:47,125
Do you still want me to marry him?

563
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:52,682
You will love him.

564
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:09,011
Miss!

565
00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:57,321
<i>In the end,</i>

566
00:59:57,360 --> 01:00:01,570
<i>Hideko accepted the proposal,
provided that I come to Japan, too.</i>

567
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:04,451
<i>The Count, after feigning
annoyance for a bit,</i>

568
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:06,284
<i>nodded his head.</i>

569
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:09,848
<i>On the day her uncle
left to visit his mine,</i>

570
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:14,409
<i>the Count pretended to go back
to Japan and hid nearby.</i>

571
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:30,604
<font color="#ffff00">You'll have a week of freedom</font>

572
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:35,768
<font color="#ffff00">but always remember the basement.</font>

573
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:23,324

574
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:30,651
<font color="#ffff00">Thank you for travelling on
our ferry today.</font>

575

<font color="#ffff00">Sorry.</font>

592
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:09,803
<i>The Count paid the innkeeper to spy on us,</i>

593
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:11,763
<i>afraid we might run off.</i>

594
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:15,090
Why get dressed?
I've nothing to do anyway.

595

<i>Things are moving too slowly.</i>

596

<i>I fear Hideko might truly go mad.</i>

597
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:25,807
Shall we play 'maid', like before?

598
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:33,490
<i>From morning to night
we see no sign of the Count.</i>

599

<i>Certifying the marriage

<i>require much work, he says.</i>

601
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:20,089
How cruel can you be?

602
01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:23,442
You plucked the ﬂower, now re-plant it.

603
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:25,482
What do you want?

604
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:29,565
Hurry up and throw her into the madhouse!

<font color="#ffff00">This way.</font>

616
01:10:48,760 --> 01:10:51,366
<font color="#ffff00">do you believe your Lady requires?</font>

617
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:09,203
<font color="#ffff00">She should be confined in a place</font>

01:25:50,040 --> 01:25:52,441
<font color="#ffff00">what would you give in exchange?</font>

765
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:56,168
<font color="#ffff00">Whatever your heart desires.</font>

766
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:59,449
<font color="#ffff00">Anything in this whole wide world.</font>

767
01:26:00,840 --> 01:26:04,367
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Once the duke untied me,</i></font>

768
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:08,450
<font color="#ffff00"><i>"I sat on the chair, pulled her to me,"</i></font>

769
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:13,408
<font color="#ffff00">"and slid my cock into her cunt."</font>

770
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:21,444
<font color="#ffff00">" 'Oh, Juliette, Juliette...' "</font>

771
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:28,801
<font color="#ffff00">"As I felt the duke approach from behind,"</font>

772
01:26:28,840 --> 01:26:31,446
<font color="#ffff00">"a rope slithered around my neck."</font>

773
01:26:33,040 --> 01:26:36,169
<font color="#ffff00">"The duke slowly tightened the rope."</font>

774
01:26:36,240 --> 01:26:40,928
<font color="#ffff00">"Like a drowning man grasping at straws,"</font>

775
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:45,409
<font color="#ffff00">"I pulled the swirling
currents of her hair."</font>

776
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:49,126
<font color="#ffff00">"Then the duke spoke,"</font>

<font color="#ffff00">"' 'The 10 minutes are almost up.' "</font>

<font color="#ffff00">" 'Slowly, my dear,' said the Duchess."</font>

779
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:13,449
<font color="#ffff00">" 'I haven't yet fully savored his pain.' "</font>

784
01:28:17,360 --> 01:28:19,089
<font color="#ffff00">Is it Sade?</font>

785
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:21,841
<font color="#ffff00">It's Sade-esque.</font>

786
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:26,926
<font color="#ffff00">Believed to be the same Japanese
man who wrote "The Lizard Skin."</font>

787
01:28:27,680 --> 01:28:32,607
<font color="#ffff00">Acquired from a Japanese sailor
on a ship from Hamburg.</font>

788
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:45,323
<font color="#ffff00">Poorly printed, on low-quality paper...</font>

789
01:28:46,280 --> 01:28:48,567
<font color="#ffff00">used and torn,</font>

790
01:28:48,760 --> 01:28:52,128
<font color="#ffff00">stained from food
and human secretions...</font>

791
01:28:53,960 --> 01:28:58,648
<font color="#ffff00">I have a predilection
for this kind of little cherub.</font>

792
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:03,765
<font color="#ffff00">Can you imagine my joy when,</font>

793
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:08,209
<font color="#ffff00">after such a journey,
it sat on my shelf with its brothers?</font>

794
01:29:08,320 --> 01:29:12,769
<font color="#ffff00">An untouched 1st edition of Milton
wouldn't satisfy me more.</font>

795
01:29:14,760 --> 01:29:16,046
<font color="#ffff00">Yes.</font>

796
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:21,088
<font color="#ffff00">These are the babes
to whom I feel the most affection.</font>

797
01:29:22,520 --> 01:29:28,448
<font color="#ffff00">It used to contain an elaborate
monochrome woodcut illustration,</font>

798
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:32,211
<font color="#ffff00">but as you can see...</font>

799
01:29:32,320 --> 01:29:34,368
<font color="#ffff00">So unfortunate.</font>

800
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:40,562
<font color="#ffff00">If that were intact,
you could've named your price.</font>

801
01:29:41,720 --> 01:29:46,044
<font color="#ffff00">The author felt words alone could
not fully describe the positions,</font>

802
01:29:46,200 --> 01:29:49,807
<font color="#ffff00">and so included an illustration.</font>

803
01:29:51,120 --> 01:29:54,761
<font color="#ffff00">In that regard, before
we start the bidding...</font>

804
01:29:55,320 --> 01:29:56,321
<font color="#ffff00">Hideko!</font>

805
01:29:56,760 --> 01:29:59,525
<font color="#ffff00">Can you perform this scene?</font>

806
01:30:37,320 --> 01:30:40,244
<font color="#ffff00">'Pain is a Garment'</font>

807
01:32:02,920 --> 01:32:04,285
<font color="#ffff00">Beautiful!</font>

808
01:32:10,760 --> 01:32:12,728
<font color="#ffff00">See you again.</font>

809
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:14,567
<font color="#ffff00">Yes, thank you.</font>

810
01:32:15,720 --> 01:32:19,088
<font color="#ffff00">Today's reading was outstanding.</font>

811
01:32:19,320 --> 01:32:20,731
<font color="#ffff00">Yes, thank you.</font>

812
01:32:22,520 --> 01:32:24,329
<font color="#ffff00">Especially the puppet!</font>

813
01:32:52,360 --> 01:32:54,362
<font color="#ffff00">You are of noble birth,</font>

814
01:32:54,440 --> 01:32:58,843
<font color="#ffff00">yet you engage in the lowly work
of copying paintings.</font>

815
01:32:59,160 --> 01:33:02,369
<font color="#ffff00">There was a time when</font>

816
01:33:02,440 --> 01:33:06,047
<font color="#ffff00">I dissipated my wit and skills on gambling.</font>

817
01:33:06,120 --> 01:33:09,727
<font color="#ffff00">Imagine the torment
of having so many women</font>

818
01:33:09,800 --> 01:33:11,768
<font color="#ffff00">make advances on me,</font>

819
01:33:11,800 --> 01:33:15,122
<font color="#ffff00">when I couldn't afford to
buy them a glass of Burgundy.</font>

820
01:33:15,720 --> 01:33:20,169
<font color="#ffff00">Do the women here advance on you?</font>

821
01:33:20,680 --> 01:33:22,728
<font color="#ffff00">I look at women's eyes.</font>

822
01:33:22,760 --> 01:33:24,489
<font color="#ffff00">Only the eyes.</font>

823
01:33:24,640 --> 01:33:28,247
<font color="#ffff00">They turn their gaze away,</font>

824
01:33:28,400 --> 01:33:30,641
<font color="#ffff00">but then they always look back.</font>

825
01:33:31,240 --> 01:33:34,483
<font color="#ffff00">It's a kind of silent dialogue.</font>

826
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:39,881
<font color="#ffff00">If I were to slide under
someone's covers tonight,</font>

827
01:33:40,160 --> 01:33:44,131
<font color="#ffff00">only one woman here would refuse me.</font>

828
01:33:45,560 --> 01:33:47,881
<font color="#ffff00">Does that include Mrs. Sasaki?</font>

829
01:33:48,600 --> 01:33:50,762
<font color="#ffff00">Mrs. Sasaki...</font>

830
01:33:52,160 --> 01:33:54,640
<font color="#ffff00">Is she not your former wife?</font>

831
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:58,004
<font color="#ffff00">You left her to marry a Japanese woman.</font>

832
01:33:58,400 --> 01:34:02,610
<font color="#ffff00">But the servants tell me
you still share a bed with her.</font>

833
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:07,165
<font color="#ffff00">Can I ask you a question?</font>

834
01:34:10,080 --> 01:34:11,650
<font color="#ffff00">Go ahead.</font>

835
01:34:12,640 --> 01:34:15,007
<font color="#ffff00">You went so far as to abandon your wife,</font>

836
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:17,646
<font color="#ffff00">why this urge to become Japanese?</font>

837
01:34:20,040 --> 01:34:21,644
<font color="#ffff00">Because Korea is ugly,</font>

838
01:34:22,160 --> 01:34:25,050
<font color="#ffff00">and Japan is beautiful.</font>

839
01:34:26,320 --> 01:34:29,369
<font color="#ffff00">Some Japanese say Japan is ugly</font>

840
01:34:29,440 --> 01:34:31,488
<font color="#ffff00">and Korea is beautiful.</font>

841
01:34:31,560 --> 01:34:34,006
<font color="#ffff00">Beauty is cruel by nature.</font>

842
01:34:34,040 --> 01:34:37,965
<font color="#ffff00">Korea is soft, slow, dull,
and therefore hopeless.</font>

843
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:43,888
<font color="#ffff00">Tell me about this woman
who would resist you.</font>

844
01:34:47,200 --> 01:34:51,125
<font color="#ffff00">Does it include Mrs. Sasaki?</font>

845
01:34:51,240 --> 01:34:53,049
<font color="#ffff00">Mrs. Sasaki...</font>

846
01:34:55,520 --> 01:34:57,170
<font color="#ffff00">If I gave her the right signal,</font>

847
01:34:57,200 --> 01:35:01,603
<font color="#ffff00">she'd knock on my door
without her underwear.</font>

848
01:35:09,200 --> 01:35:11,282
<font color="#ffff00">My thoughts exactly.</font>

849
01:35:13,400 --> 01:35:15,209
<font color="#ffff00">Then who is it?</font>

850
01:35:15,320 --> 01:35:18,210
<font color="#ffff00">The one who would deny you?</font>

851
01:35:20,040 --> 01:35:23,044
<font color="#ffff00">I heard you own the highest quality</font>

852
01:35:23,080 --> 01:35:27,005
<font color="#ffff00">antique bookmaking tools of East and West,</font>

853
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:29,329
<font color="#ffff00">but I don't see them here.</font>

854
01:35:29,400 --> 01:35:31,846
<font color="#ffff00">I'll show them to you later.</font>

855
01:35:32,920 --> 01:35:35,491
<font color="#ffff00">This woman...</font>

856
01:35:37,400 --> 01:35:39,402
<font color="#ffff00">who is she then?</font>

857
01:35:41,480 --> 01:35:46,202
<font color="#ffff00">I met Hideko's eyes by chance,
but she didn't look away.</font>

858
01:35:46,280 --> 01:35:49,727
<font color="#ffff00">Indeed it was I who shifted my gaze.</font>

859
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:56,848
<font color="#ffff00">Will she make an appearance
in your lewd dreams tonight?</font>

860
01:35:59,040 --> 01:36:02,089
<font color="#ffff00">Even if honored with such a visit,</font>

861
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:04,927
<font color="#ffff00">I don't think I could consummate.</font>

862
01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:09,684
<font color="#ffff00">I would regret it as soon as I began.</font>

863
01:36:09,960 --> 01:36:13,806
<font color="#ffff00">Because her body
would be as cold as waterfowl.</font>

864
01:36:18,400 --> 01:36:21,563
<font color="#ffff00">The result of long training.</font>

865
01:36:22,560 --> 01:36:25,564
<font color="#ffff00">I heard you are engaged to her.</font>

866
01:36:30,080 --> 01:36:35,928
<font color="#ffff00">If I'm not mistaken,
you are yet to have intercourse?</font>

867
01:36:36,840 --> 01:36:39,730
<font color="#ffff00">Her eyes have no desire.</font>

868
01:36:40,040 --> 01:36:43,010
<font color="#ffff00">It means her soul is dead inside.</font>

869
01:36:44,440 --> 01:36:46,841
<font color="#ffff00">You should go easy on her training,</font>

870
01:36:46,960 --> 01:36:50,601
<font color="#ffff00">unless you enjoy making love to a corpse.</font>

871
01:37:13,880 --> 01:37:15,769
<font color="#ffff00">Would you like a cigarette?</font>

872
01:37:24,040 --> 01:37:27,931
<font color="#ffff00">How could a man with such refined tastes</font>

873
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:32,130
<font color="#ffff00">indulge in a pleasure
as vulgar as a cigarette?</font>

874
01:38:25,800 --> 01:38:29,646
<font color="#ffff00">My particular way of possessing beauty.</font>

875
01:38:31,080 --> 01:38:34,527
<font color="#ffff00">Hideko, too, must have
received painting lessons?</font>

876
01:38:35,480 --> 01:38:42,090
<font color="#ffff00">In fact, I was too occupied teaching
her to read with correct diction.</font>

877
01:38:43,400 --> 01:38:44,481
<font color="#ffff00">Dear me!</font>

878
01:38:44,760 --> 01:38:47,001
<font color="#ffff00">In England, where I studied,</font>

879
01:38:47,080 --> 01:38:52,962
<font color="#ffff00">all ladies were expected to produce
vibrant color and graceful lines,</font>

880
01:38:54,440 --> 01:38:56,363
<font color="#ffff00">even in the less noble families.</font>

881
01:39:15,640 --> 01:39:17,688
<font color="#ffff00">A phone call, sir.</font>

882
01:39:18,520 --> 01:39:20,443
<font color="#ffff00">At this hour?</font>

883
01:39:20,520 --> 01:39:22,568
<font color="#ffff00">It's the lwamura Bookstore.</font>

884
01:39:23,200 --> 01:39:24,201
<font color="#ffff00">Is that so?</font>

885
01:39:24,560 --> 01:39:26,562
<font color="#ffff00">Excuse me a moment.</font>

886
01:39:36,560 --> 01:39:38,483
<font color="#ffff00">You are mesmerizing.</font>

887
01:39:39,960 --> 01:39:41,644
<font color="#ffff00">Men use the word "mesmerizing"</font>

888
01:39:41,680 --> 01:39:46,004
<font color="#ffff00">when they wish to touch a lady's breasts.</font>

889
01:39:46,840 --> 01:39:50,890
<font color="#ffff00">I'm familiar with
Western conversational etiquette.</font>

890
01:39:52,600 --> 01:39:55,683
<font color="#ffff00">I do a bit of reading, you know.</font>

891
01:39:56,160 --> 01:39:58,527
<font color="#ffff00">There was no calculation in what I said.</font>

892
01:39:58,560 --> 01:40:03,691
<font color="#ffff00">It was a reflex, like pulling
one's hand from a ﬂame.</font>

893
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:05,811
<font color="#ffff00">I'm no flame.</font>

894
01:40:06,320 --> 01:40:09,722
<font color="#ffff00">I'm cold as waterfowl, your Lordship.</font>

895
01:40:15,720 --> 01:40:17,688
<font color="#ffff00">He will return soon.</font>

896
01:40:17,720 --> 01:40:20,724
<font color="#ffff00">Mr. lwamura only called
with a frivolous inquiry,</font>

897
01:40:20,800 --> 01:40:22,689
<font color="#ffff00">at my request.</font>

898
01:40:22,720 --> 01:40:26,088
<font color="#ffff00">There's an issue regarding your future
you should know.</font>

899
01:40:26,440 --> 01:40:29,728
<font color="#ffff00">I'll wait by the stone lamp at midnight.</font>

900
01:40:31,400 --> 01:40:34,882
<font color="#ffff00">That lwamura is a real fool.</font>

901
01:40:40,720 --> 01:40:42,961
<font color="#ffff00">Good night, Miss.</font>

902
01:41:53,960 --> 01:41:56,042
<font color="#ffff00">My maid is asleep in the room next door.</font>

903
01:41:56,120 --> 01:41:58,646
<font color="#ffff00">I don't fancy being
in scandalous rumors with you.</font>

904
01:41:58,720 --> 01:42:02,008
<font color="#ffff00">I saw Junko go to the servants' quarters
with her pillow.</font>

905
01:42:02,080 --> 01:42:04,481
<font color="#ffff00">Consider your reputation as a nobleman.</font>

906
01:42:04,960 --> 01:42:06,849
<font color="#ffff00">I'm no nobleman.</font>

907
01:42:06,920 --> 01:42:08,445
<font color="#ffff00">I'm not even Japanese.</font>

908
01:42:08,680 --> 01:42:11,604
Think it was easy for a Korean
farmhand's son to reach here?

909
01:42:12,160 --> 01:42:16,131
Fifteen hard years in Japan
before hearing about you.

910
01:42:16,160 --> 01:42:18,208
Another three years to prepare.

911
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:22,168
I studied bookmaking
and learned to paint forgeries.

912
01:42:22,680 --> 01:42:24,762
All so that I could meet you.

913
01:42:25,200 --> 01:42:26,725
To seduce and marry you,

914
01:42:26,760 --> 01:42:29,161
to possess your father's inheritance,

915
01:42:29,840 --> 01:42:31,888
and then probably to get rid of you.

916
01:42:33,640 --> 01:42:35,404
But I knew as soon as I met you.

917
01:42:35,640 --> 01:42:38,007
For a man to seduce you would be...

918
01:42:40,120 --> 01:42:41,610
Impossible.

919
01:42:43,040 --> 01:42:46,328
So in place of seduction,
I decided to propose a deal.

920
01:42:47,760 --> 01:42:51,287
Most marriages are prison,
but this one will free you.

921
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:53,968
I'll rescue you from here,

922
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:57,561
take you far away,
and give you freedom.

923
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,207
Of course, we'll split the money.

924
01:43:02,320 --> 01:43:04,049
Nonsense.

925
01:43:04,680 --> 01:43:09,242
Marrying an old man with a black tongue
at your tender age makes sense?

926
01:43:09,320 --> 01:43:11,322
I won't marry anyone.

927
01:43:11,560 --> 01:43:13,164
What have you in mind?

928
01:43:17,040 --> 01:43:18,041
Mmm.

929
01:43:18,840 --> 01:43:20,365
That's not proper.

930
01:43:20,680 --> 01:43:22,091
There's no beauty in that.

931
01:43:22,640 --> 01:43:24,881
If you kill yourself, what of your fortune?

932
01:43:25,520 --> 01:43:30,242
That will be the sum of your efforts?
Your fortune going to a pervert?

933
01:43:30,320 --> 01:43:34,450
So he can buy 10 little girls
and teach them to read books?

934
01:43:35,800 --> 01:43:38,087
My uncle will find us somehow.

935
01:43:38,320 --> 01:43:39,845
Then he'll take us to the basement.

936
01:43:40,880 --> 01:43:42,006
<font color="#ffff00">Uncle.</font>

937
01:43:42,880 --> 01:43:43,881
The basement?

938
01:43:44,120 --> 01:43:47,363
<font color="#ffff00"><i>It says here when people are hanged,</i></font>

939
01:43:47,640 --> 01:43:52,521
<font color="#ffff00">their tongues stick out
and feces is expelled.</font>

940
01:43:53,400 --> 01:43:57,246
<font color="#ffff00">But that day, Aunt's mouth was shut,</font>

941
01:43:58,240 --> 01:44:00,288
<font color="#ffff00">and her bottom was clean.</font>

942
01:44:01,720 --> 01:44:03,688
<font color="#ffff00">Want to go somewhere nice?</font>

943
01:44:21,600 --> 01:44:25,525
<font color="#ffff00">I'll tell you in detail
what I did to your aunt</font>

944
01:44:25,600 --> 01:44:27,523
<font color="#ffff00">after I caught her running away.</font>

945
01:44:27,800 --> 01:44:32,488
<font color="#ffff00">So don't you ever think of running,
understood?</font>

946
01:44:50,320 --> 01:44:52,527
That day I just watched and listened.

947
01:44:52,640 --> 01:44:56,247
But if I ever end up there again...

948
01:45:01,080 --> 01:45:02,764
Highly concentrated opium.

949
01:45:02,800 --> 01:45:05,087
Three drops will make you sleep all day.

950
01:45:05,120 --> 01:45:08,010
Five drops will knock down a horse.

951
01:45:08,080 --> 01:45:10,686
If you crave death within five minutes,

952
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:12,764
drink it all.

953
01:45:12,800 --> 01:45:16,202
If you carry this, he can never
take you to the basement.

954
01:45:16,240 --> 01:45:17,730
At least not alive.

955
01:45:18,520 --> 01:45:20,363
It'll be my wedding gift to you.

956
01:45:20,880 --> 01:45:22,723
It's more expensive than jewels.

957
01:45:34,320 --> 01:45:39,690
Bring a girl to be my maid.
One who could disappear and not be missed.

958
01:45:39,720 --> 01:45:41,370
If a bit dense, all the better.

959
01:45:41,480 --> 01:45:45,565
We'll send her to a madhouse
under my name.

960
01:45:47,880 --> 01:45:52,522
They say that the sick are
buried alive in pits.

961
01:45:53,640 --> 01:45:56,484
I want my name to be buried there.

962
01:45:57,400 --> 01:45:59,687
I can find you a new maid,

963
01:45:59,760 --> 01:46:01,728
but what do we do about Junko?

964
01:46:07,640 --> 01:46:12,362
<font color="#ffff00">You really think
I'm prettier than Miss Hideko?</font>

965
01:46:13,920 --> 01:46:17,766
Sure, Hideko's pretty,
and you're pretty.

966
01:46:18,080 --> 01:46:19,889
What? You speak Korean?

967
01:46:21,400 --> 01:46:22,811
You know...

968
01:46:23,840 --> 01:46:25,285
I learned it.

969
01:46:25,680 --> 01:46:28,445
To speak more easily with you.

970
01:46:29,600 --> 01:46:32,649
I really wanted to say this to you.

971
01:46:33,800 --> 01:46:35,290
You are just mesmerizing.

972
01:46:35,320 --> 01:46:36,606
Oh, my gosh!

973
01:46:38,800 --> 01:46:40,564
You little tart!

974
01:46:45,560 --> 01:46:47,562
I can't!

975
01:46:47,640 --> 01:46:50,564
If they catch me with a guest,
I'll be thrown out!

976
01:46:51,720 --> 01:46:55,805
Forget this wretched place.
Come live with me!

977
01:47:42,920 --> 01:47:44,285
Oh, fucking hell!

978
01:47:45,200 --> 01:47:46,281
Fucking hell?

979
01:47:46,360 --> 01:47:47,600
Fucking hell...

980
01:48:38,640 --> 01:48:41,405
<i>The Count sent exactly what I ordered.</i>

981
01:48:41,440 --> 01:48:43,886
<i>Naive and a bit foolish.</i>

982
01:48:47,720 --> 01:48:49,529
We look a bit alike.

983
01:48:50,480 --> 01:48:52,244
Are you also an orphan?

984
01:48:56,080 --> 01:48:57,650
<font color="#ffff00">Mother!</font>

985
01:49:08,640 --> 01:49:11,644
<i>Show Sook-hee your old clothes</i>

986
01:49:11,680 --> 01:49:13,762
<i>or jewelry at every opportunity.</i>

987
01:49:13,840 --> 01:49:18,164
<i>The material greed she got from her
mother will make her more gullible.</i>

988
01:49:18,200 --> 01:49:24,048
<i>P.S. Don't worry if she reads this
letter, she's totally illiterate.</i>

989
01:49:24,440 --> 01:49:25,851
Would you read it to me?

990
01:49:26,480 --> 01:49:27,402
<font color="#ffff00">Pardon?</font>

991
01:49:28,600 --> 01:49:30,443
<font color="#ffff00">"...said you're looking for a maid."</font>

992
01:49:30,520 --> 01:49:32,966
<font color="#ffff00">"Maids are like"</font>

993
01:49:33,480 --> 01:49:35,369
<font color="#ffff00">"a spoon..." No...</font>

994
01:49:37,280 --> 01:49:39,647
<font color="#ffff00">"Are like chopsticks..."</font>

995
01:49:43,600 --> 01:49:45,523
<font color="#ffff00">Is it a spoon?</font>

996
01:49:45,800 --> 01:49:46,642
'Countess Fujiwara Hideko'

997
01:49:46,720 --> 01:49:50,645
'Countess Fujiwara Hideko'
This is your name.
Can't you read it?

998
01:49:54,920 --> 01:49:56,684
What's with your foot?

999
01:50:00,880 --> 01:50:02,086
<font color="#ffff00">Who did it?</font>

1000
01:50:02,520 --> 01:50:05,091
<font color="#ffff00">Who took Tamako's shoe?</font>

1001
01:50:11,880 --> 01:50:14,167
<font color="#ffff00">Apologize before all the servants!</font>

1002
01:50:17,400 --> 01:50:20,404
<font color="#ffff00">If she ever runs away
because of one of you,</font>

1003
01:50:20,440 --> 01:50:22,807
<font color="#ffff00">I'll strip you all naked
and throw you out!</font>

1004
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:25,001
Fucking hell.

1005
01:50:29,840 --> 01:50:31,126
All smooth.

1006
01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:39,684
You like the scent?

1007
01:50:40,480 --> 01:50:41,891
Want to come in?

1008
01:50:42,080 --> 01:50:43,081
Pardon?

1009
01:51:03,640 --> 01:51:05,005
<font color="#ffff00">This must be Okju.</font>

1010
01:51:05,240 --> 01:51:08,050
<font color="#ffff00">At your service, milord.</font>

1011
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:12,800
<font color="#ffff00">You know if you fail,
it'll put me in an awkward position?</font>

1012
01:51:17,680 --> 01:51:21,321
<font color="#ffff00">A decent bone structure for a Korean...</font>

1013
01:51:24,840 --> 01:51:29,289
<font color="#ffff00">So, are you carrying out
your duties faithfully?</font>

1014
01:51:33,360 --> 01:51:36,125
<font color="#ffff00">Thank you for your recommendation.</font>

1015
01:51:36,280 --> 01:51:40,922
<font color="#ffff00">You chose the perfect servant for me.</font>

1016
01:51:41,840 --> 01:51:45,561
<font color="#ffff00">You wouldn't want one who's too stupid.
I did my best.</font>

1017
01:51:46,400 --> 01:51:49,847
<font color="#ffff00">Take good care of our dear Lady.</font>

1018
01:51:50,160 --> 01:51:51,082
<font color="#ffff00">Take this.</font>

1019
01:51:54,120 --> 01:51:56,885
<font color="#ffff00">There's no shame
in being rewarded</font>

1020
01:51:57,040 --> 01:52:00,965
<font color="#ffff00">for being a good companion
to the Lady.</font>

1021
01:52:03,520 --> 01:52:05,682
<font color="#ffff00">Isn't that right Ms. Hideko?</font>

1022
01:52:07,480 --> 01:52:09,244
No need to be ashamed at all.

1023
01:52:09,280 --> 01:52:11,601
Your average fence
can barely tell them apart.

1024
01:52:11,720 --> 01:52:13,802
Is that so?

1025
01:52:19,280 --> 01:52:21,442
<i>Returning the earrings you loaned me.</i>

1026
01:52:21,960 --> 01:52:25,009
<i>A woman might wager her fate
on such an exquisite pair.</i>

1027
01:52:26,040 --> 01:52:28,611
<i>I'm sure that Sook-hee will try her very best</i>

1028
01:52:28,720 --> 01:52:33,408
<i>in order to see herself
wearing these in the mirror.</i>

1029
01:52:33,920 --> 01:52:37,208
I'll tell you how to keep her
from getting suspicious.

1030
01:52:37,400 --> 01:52:40,609
Keep her busy until the
day of the wedding.

1031
01:52:41,120 --> 01:52:43,248
Make her spend all her energy

1032
01:52:43,280 --> 01:52:45,851
on making you fall in love with me.

1033
01:52:47,520 --> 01:52:51,366
In other words,
don't fall in love with me so easily.

1034
01:53:01,600 --> 01:53:03,090
<font color="#ffff00">Mesmerizing!</font>

1035
01:53:05,720 --> 01:53:06,801
Me?

1036
01:53:15,720 --> 01:53:18,121
Dressed up, you look like a lady, too.

1037
01:53:26,600 --> 01:53:28,409
<font color="#ffff00">Almost fully ripe.</font>

1038
01:53:38,040 --> 01:53:40,281
How did your mom die?

1039
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:44,447
That she was so lucky
to have you before dying.

1040
01:53:45,280 --> 01:53:47,328
That she had no regrets.

1041
01:53:48,560 --> 01:53:52,610
<i>Is this the companionship
they write about in books?</i>

1042
01:53:55,720 --> 01:53:57,370
I'll go pick mushrooms.

1043
01:53:57,400 --> 01:54:00,404
We'll have mushroom stew tonight,
you like that.

1044
01:54:00,640 --> 01:54:01,846
I'll go with you.

1045
01:54:02,840 --> 01:54:04,922
I'll be quick.

1046
01:54:18,840 --> 01:54:21,127
What's wrong with her?
Is it her period?

1047
01:54:29,480 --> 01:54:31,050
Men are disgusting.

1048
01:54:31,560 --> 01:54:34,325
How can they be so single-minded?

1049
01:54:34,920 --> 01:54:36,490
What's on my mind?

1050
01:54:37,360 --> 01:54:41,001
You don't really believe
that I crave your body?

1051
01:54:42,720 --> 01:54:43,881
You do!

1052
01:54:43,960 --> 01:54:45,644
You read too many of those books.

1053
01:54:45,720 --> 01:54:47,848
If there's one thing I'm after, Miss...

1054
01:54:48,640 --> 01:54:53,726
It's not your eyes, your hands or ass,

1055
01:54:54,080 --> 01:54:56,560
it's your money, only that.

1056
01:54:57,240 --> 01:54:59,925
Of all that you have, money is the best.

1057
01:55:01,560 --> 01:55:04,769
Feels great being so rude to a noble lady.

1058
01:55:05,560 --> 01:55:07,369

1059
01:55:08,080 --> 01:55:12,244
<i>Why does she stomp her feet,
expressing her anger,</i>

1060
01:55:12,320 --> 01:55:15,051
<i>sit up in the middle of the night
and sigh?</i>

<i>Every time she sees the Count,
her eyes seem to say...</i>

1062
01:55:21,360 --> 01:55:23,044
I despise you.

1063
01:55:23,920 --> 01:55:29,404
Try to bear it. Only if she sees this
will she believe the proposal.

1064
01:55:48,360 --> 01:55:52,081
Think of me as that puppet,
and I'll imagine another woman.

1065
01:55:52,680 --> 01:55:54,364
What woman?

1066
01:55:57,360 --> 01:55:59,362

Of course.

1112
02:00:05,440 --> 02:00:07,408
Yes...

1113
02:00:08,400 --> 02:00:10,402
Teach me everything.

1114
02:00:54,480 --> 02:00:59,520
I wish that I had breast milk
so I could feed you.

1115
02:01:14,120 --> 02:01:16,248
Do you like it when I do this?

1116
02:01:17,360 --> 02:01:18,850
Do you like me?

Can you promise that you won't betray me?

1118

I spit it out without chewing!
All because of you!

1125
02:02:56,080 --> 02:02:57,445
She's got no one on this earth.

1126
02:02:57,760 --> 02:03:01,003
If you frighten her,
she'll close up hard as a clam.

1127
02:03:01,280 --> 02:03:02,805
And please...

1128
02:03:03,240 --> 02:03:08,007
Don't ever again put my hand
on your tiny joke of a cock.

1129
02:03:15,360 --> 02:03:16,850
You see?

1130
02:03:17,840 --> 02:03:20,571
If you don't give the impression
you want this marriage,

1131
02:03:20,600 --> 02:03:23,922
she may throw another fit
and refuse to go forward.

1132
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:27,243
Be more convincing
when you pretend to love me.

1133
02:03:27,280 --> 02:03:28,566
I can't do it.

1134
02:03:28,600 --> 02:03:29,681
What?

1135
02:03:30,320 --> 02:03:31,765
I want to quit.

1136
02:03:33,120 --> 02:03:35,327
What's with you all today?

1137
02:03:36,600 --> 02:03:38,011
Why then?

1138
02:03:38,760 --> 02:03:42,731
I hate all of you. My mother, my aunt,
my uncle, you, and...

1139
02:03:45,480 --> 02:03:46,811
And?

1140
02:03:48,040 --> 02:03:49,451
I can't stand Sook-hee anymore either.

1141
02:03:49,520 --> 02:03:51,409
You feel sorry for her?

1142
02:03:54,560 --> 02:03:56,642
What is it with women?

1143
02:03:59,720 --> 02:04:03,691
You know what that poor
Sook-hee said about your Ladyship?

1144
02:04:03,880 --> 02:04:07,487
That you're too dense to get it
if someone pulls on your nipples.

1145
02:04:07,520 --> 02:04:10,490
That she was nice out of pity,
but you ate it up.

1146
02:04:10,520 --> 02:04:12,204
That you were so gullible!

1147
02:04:12,440 --> 02:04:15,808
That naive servant's face...

1148
02:04:16,080 --> 02:04:18,367
Yes, you will love him.

1149
02:04:18,560 --> 02:04:21,928
If I say that I love someone else...

1150
02:04:22,920 --> 02:04:27,289
Me, who has no one on this earth...

1151
02:04:27,920 --> 02:04:30,321
Do you still want me to marry him?

1152
02:04:30,920 --> 02:04:31,921
Yes.

1153
02:04:43,480 --> 02:04:44,606
Miss!

1154
02:05:07,360 --> 02:05:10,250
<i>I wish I'd never been born.</i>

1155
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:45,402
<i>I wish I'd never been born.</i>

1156
02:06:05,160 --> 02:06:06,241
Let go.

1157
02:06:08,880 --> 02:06:11,929
Miss, I'm sorry!

1158
02:06:14,520 --> 02:06:15,521
Let go!

1159
02:06:15,960 --> 02:06:17,928
I'm sorry, Miss!

1160
02:06:18,160 --> 02:06:19,924
Don't die.

1161
02:06:20,240 --> 02:06:21,924
I'm sorry.

1162
02:06:23,960 --> 02:06:25,849
What are you sorry about?

1163
02:06:26,960 --> 02:06:31,921
I tried to trick you
into marrying that bastard.

1164
02:06:31,960 --> 02:06:35,965
I was going to put you
in a madhouse and run off.

1165
02:06:36,680 --> 02:06:40,685
Don't die. Don't get married, Miss!

1166
02:06:42,840 --> 02:06:46,481
Sook-hee, are you worried about me?

1167
02:06:51,840 --> 02:06:53,524
I'm worried about you.

1168
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:02,129
How do you know my name?

1169
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:05,401
You think you're tricking me?

1170
02:07:07,800 --> 02:07:09,529
You're the one being tricked.

1171
02:07:10,800 --> 02:07:13,610
You're the one bound for the madhouse.

1172
02:07:15,360 --> 02:07:18,284
I was going to lock you up
in there under my name,

1173
02:07:18,320 --> 02:07:21,847
then I'd become you
and run far away, with him.

1174
02:07:26,520 --> 02:07:30,127
I won't say sorry,
since you tried to trick me, too.

1175

02:14:26,960 --> 02:14:27,563
The next month, I wore it to
dine at the Imperial Hotel.

1206
02:14:27,564 --> 02:14:30,759
'PART THREE'
The next month, I wore
it to dine at the Imperial Hotel.

1207
02:14:30,760 --> 02:14:30,851
'PART THREE'

1208
02:14:30,920 --> 02:14:34,003
Me, a colonial boy working
as a tout at a brothel.

1209
02:14:34,080 --> 02:14:37,243
Some Englishmen who frequented
the brothel recognized me.

1210
02:14:37,280 --> 02:14:40,921
I thought they'd call
the maitre d' and kick me out,

1211
02:14:41,440 --> 02:14:42,851
but what do you know?

1212
02:14:43,440 --> 02:14:48,002
They were amused I'd
spend a month's pay

1213
02:14:48,080 --> 02:14:49,605
on one dignified meal.

1214
02:14:50,440 --> 02:14:52,841
They started calling me Count

1215
02:14:52,920 --> 02:14:54,843
and taught me manners
to go with the name.

1216
02:14:54,880 --> 02:14:57,247
Frankly, I'm not that interested
in money itself.

1217
02:14:57,280 --> 02:14:59,931
What I desire is, how shall I put it...

1218
02:15:00,920 --> 02:15:03,651
The manner of ordering wine
without looking at the price?

1219
02:15:03,680 --> 02:15:05,045
Something like that.

1220
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:19,526
Fourteen hours by train from Vladivostok

1221
02:15:19,600 --> 02:15:21,841
is the summer home of
a genuine Russian noble family.

1222
02:15:21,842 --> 02:15:23,683
The villa is entirely furnished.

1223
02:15:23,684 --> 02:15:26,206
The carpets are very soft.

1224
02:15:33,520 --> 02:15:35,284
Shall we marry there?

1225
02:15:40,440 --> 02:15:42,647
<i>In a few days I'll hear from the hospital.</i>

1226
02:15:44,600 --> 02:15:47,126
That my wife Fujiwara Hideko has died.

1227
02:15:49,320 --> 02:15:53,803
You didn't just ask them to keep her?

1228
02:15:54,800 --> 02:15:58,202
I doubt Sook-hee would want
to live there very long.

1229
02:16:06,800 --> 02:16:08,689
Fuck!

1230
02:16:12,760 --> 02:16:14,125
<i>Motherfucker.</i>

1231
02:16:14,400 --> 02:16:18,200
I never pretended to be
anything but a crook, my dear!

1232
02:16:19,520 --> 02:16:23,445
You will soon become
the Korean servant Nam Sook-hee.

1233
02:16:23,920 --> 02:16:25,922
I'm a talented counterfeiter.

1234
02:16:26,040 --> 02:16:28,247
I arranged it
with a photography studio.

1235
02:16:29,080 --> 02:16:32,562
From tomorrow, we'll
give Sook-hee a new life.

1236
02:16:32,680 --> 02:16:34,170
I'm glad.

1237
02:16:34,360 --> 02:16:36,283
Marry me once again.

1238
02:16:37,040 --> 02:16:38,565
This time as Nam Sook-hee.

1239
02:16:40,480 --> 02:16:42,926
You want another wedding night?

1240
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:52,163
I think I like you, slightly.

1241
02:16:55,480 --> 02:16:58,006
Poor Sook-hee, in a place like that

1242
02:16:59,120 --> 02:17:01,168
all by herself...

1243
02:17:03,160 --> 02:17:05,970
Did such a thought ever cross your mind?

1244
02:17:06,560 --> 02:17:09,086
Not at all. Why should I pity her?

1245
02:17:09,160 --> 02:17:12,243
Where I come from,
it's illegal to be naive.

1246
02:17:12,480 --> 02:17:16,121
Where you come from, it's not naive
to fall in love with a business partner?

1247
02:17:16,160 --> 02:17:18,162
Of course. It's illegal.

1248
02:17:18,640 --> 02:17:22,167
So even if my love for
you leads me to ruin,

1249
02:17:22,600 --> 02:17:24,204
don't pity me.

1250
02:17:24,920 --> 02:17:26,126
Love?

1251
02:17:28,160 --> 02:17:30,208
What does a crook know about love?

1252
02:17:51,600 --> 02:17:53,364
What's that?

1253
02:17:54,160 --> 02:17:55,366
<font color="#ffff00">Fire!</font>

1254
02:18:04,080 --> 02:18:08,051
<font color="#ffff00">C...c...come this way!</font>

1255
02:18:08,080 --> 02:18:09,127
<font color="#ffff00">This way!</font>

1256
02:19:18,880 --> 02:19:21,770
Because you desired me

1257
02:19:21,920 --> 02:19:23,922
and overcame all obstacles to reach me,

1258
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:26,480
I have been born anew, it's true.

1259
02:19:27,760 --> 02:19:29,569
I'm grateful for that.

1260
02:19:31,600 --> 02:19:33,762
I'll allow a kiss.

1261
02:19:38,800 --> 02:19:39,961
No.

1262
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:41,047
Why not?

1263
02:19:44,160 --> 02:19:46,162
I don't like kisses with conditions.

1264
02:19:46,360 --> 02:19:49,250
I never learned how to stop halfway.

1265
02:19:51,160 --> 02:19:56,371
After this I'll thrust
in deep, to your navel.

1266
02:19:57,680 --> 02:19:59,364
Please do that.

1267
02:20:02,800 --> 02:20:04,882
Those aren't the eyes of one who wants it.

1268
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:08,004
You know you can't
deceive me in such matters.

1269
02:20:12,720 --> 02:20:16,884
<font color="#ffff00">If I could be yours
for ten minutes,</font>

1270
02:20:16,960 --> 02:20:18,962
<font color="#ffff00">what would you give in exchange?</font>

1271
02:20:19,560 --> 02:20:21,927
<font color="#ffff00">Whatever your heart desires.</font>

1272
02:20:21,960 --> 02:20:24,964
<font color="#ffff00">Anything in this whole wide world.</font>

1273
02:20:49,240 --> 02:20:51,527
There's much
I want to teach you.

1274
02:20:52,680 --> 02:20:55,843
You'll become a completely new woman.

1275
02:22:47,360 --> 02:22:50,045
It won't hurt.
You know from those books?

1276
02:22:50,120 --> 02:22:54,045
In truth, women feel the
greatest pleasure

1277
02:22:54,080 --> 02:22:56,048
when taken by force.

1278
02:22:56,360 --> 02:22:59,364
Now I'm going to rip your underwear.

1279
02:25:17,040 --> 02:25:19,805
Would you fetch those for me?

1280
02:25:29,240 --> 02:25:32,210
<font color="#ffff00">Okay, look here.</font>

1281
02:25:32,320 --> 02:25:34,243
<font color="#ffff00">One, two, three!</font>

1282
02:26:15,720 --> 02:26:17,722
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Respected Uncle,</i></font>

1283
02:26:18,840 --> 02:26:23,641
<font color="#ffff00"><i>it always pained me to see you straining</i></font>

1284
02:26:23,720 --> 02:26:28,601
<font color="#ffff00"><i>to speak flawless Japanese
before the Count from Nagoya,</i></font>

1285
02:26:28,680 --> 02:26:31,809
<font color="#ffff00"><i>and even to quiver your voice
like a nobleman.</i></font>

1286
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:40,406
<font color="#ffff00"><i>So I'm happy to inform you
that you no longer need do so.</i></font>

1287
02:26:41,360 --> 02:26:45,763
<font color="#ffff00"><i>That man is the son of a Korean farmhand.</i></font>

1288
02:26:46,760 --> 02:26:51,721
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Oh, did my gift arrive safely?</i></font>

1289
02:26:52,160 --> 02:26:55,607
<font color="#ffff00"><i>Please tell this to my gift, in Korean.</i></font>

1290
02:26:56,640 --> 02:26:58,449
<i>I'm afraid that in real life,</i>

1291
02:26:59,520 --> 02:27:03,047
<i>no woman feels pleasure
at being taken by force.</i>

1292
02:27:03,120 --> 02:27:08,684
<i>But, for sending me Sook-hee
out of all the girls in the world,</i>

1293
02:27:08,760 --> 02:27:11,206
<i>I feel "slightly" grateful.</i>

1294
02:27:24,520 --> 02:27:28,127
You wished to see my bookmaking tools?

1295
02:27:28,160 --> 02:27:32,165
Don't just look,
experience them for yourself.

1296
02:27:32,800 --> 02:27:35,121
I'll choose five books that I cherish...

1297
02:27:35,200 --> 02:27:38,204
...that I used to cherish more than anything.

1298
02:27:40,280 --> 02:27:41,281
Let's see...

1299
02:27:41,360 --> 02:27:42,327
First...

1300
02:27:45,520 --> 02:27:47,249
<font color="#ffff00">'Confessions of a Whip,'</font>

1301
02:27:56,480 --> 02:27:58,369
<font color="#ffff00">'The Lizard Skin,'</font>

1302
02:28:10,040 --> 02:28:13,044
<font color="#ffff00">'Decadent Girls Who Sell Lingerie,'</font>

1303
02:28:23,320 --> 02:28:26,164
May I please
smoke a cigarette, sir?

1304
02:28:27,040 --> 02:28:28,041
Sir.

1305
02:28:30,800 --> 02:28:33,087
<font color="#ffff00">'Bells and Balls,'</font>

1306
02:28:36,520 --> 02:28:38,443
<font color="#ffff00">'The Mortician's Bedroom.'</font>

1307
02:28:50,680 --> 02:28:53,524
How could you
let a little girl fool you?

1308
02:28:56,720 --> 02:29:00,725
<i>But don't worry.
I'll catch them for you soon.</i>

1309
02:29:06,480 --> 02:29:09,370
I'll bind two books with the skin
of these bitches.

1310
02:29:09,520 --> 02:29:13,320
And you, you'll be the third volume.

1311
02:29:14,720 --> 02:29:20,170
I arranged so that no two girls
traveling together can leave Kobe.

1312
02:29:22,880 --> 02:29:25,201
<font color="#ffff00">Please change the destination
to Shanghai.</font>

1313
02:29:25,240 --> 02:29:28,403
<font color="#ffff00">Changing two tickets,
from Vladivostok to Shanghai.</font>

1314
02:29:28,440 --> 02:29:30,249
<font color="#ffff00">Yes, that's correct.</font>

1315
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:32,684
<font color="#ffff00">Show me your passports.</font>

1316
02:29:39,720 --> 02:29:41,643
<font color="#ffff00">Miss Nam Sook-hee?</font>

1317
02:29:44,440 --> 02:29:46,329
<font color="#ffff00">Mr. Go Pan-dol?</font>

1318
02:29:54,600 --> 02:29:57,126
<font color="#ffff00">You need to pay an additional three yen.</font>

1319
02:29:57,520 --> 02:29:58,521
<font color="#ffff00">All right.</font>

1320
02:30:03,040 --> 02:30:04,087
Hideko was

1321
02:30:05,400 --> 02:30:08,609
like a peach that I looked at
on its branch.

1322
02:30:08,920 --> 02:30:11,526
I was content just
imagining its flavor.

1323
02:30:12,040 --> 02:30:14,850
Should I have bitten into it?

1324
02:30:15,640 --> 02:30:16,687
No, no.

1325
02:30:17,640 --> 02:30:22,441
I'm just an old man
who likes dirty stories.

1326
02:30:24,080 --> 02:30:28,324
Even listening to the same story,
people imagine different things.

1327
02:30:28,360 --> 02:30:31,682
Peering into each of those fantasies

1328
02:30:31,720 --> 02:30:34,769
was this old man's humble recreation.

1329
02:30:35,320 --> 02:30:38,369
What to do, now that it's all over?

1330
02:30:39,040 --> 02:30:41,361
You should at least tell me your story.

1331
02:30:43,280 --> 02:30:46,762
How did that bitch Hideko taste?

1332
02:30:47,480 --> 02:30:50,768
Was she fully ripe? Tell me.

1333
02:30:53,400 --> 02:30:56,290
A cigarette might help my memory.

1334
02:30:56,800 --> 02:30:58,768
Right, right...

1335
02:30:59,960 --> 02:31:03,760
You have that silly
penchant for cigarettes?

1336
02:31:20,800 --> 02:31:24,771
So how was Hideko?

1337
02:31:30,800 --> 02:31:34,805
You have no windows here?

1338
02:31:38,400 --> 02:31:41,643
Sook-hee could be listening in.
Let's do our best.

1339
02:31:53,400 --> 02:31:55,209
<i>That's it, good.</i>

1340
02:32:07,160 --> 02:32:08,571
<i>Why aren't you talking?</i>

1341
02:32:08,840 --> 02:32:11,047
You can't stop there,
dear fellow.

1342
02:32:11,280 --> 02:32:13,408
So, where did you touch first?

1343
02:32:14,200 --> 02:32:15,565
<i>Her face?</i>

1344
02:32:17,960 --> 02:32:19,246
Her breasts?

1345
02:32:20,800 --> 02:32:23,246
Or straight for her <font color="#ffff00">c...cunt?</font>

1346
02:32:25,280 --> 02:32:26,805
Was it soft?

1347
02:32:27,640 --> 02:32:29,324
Did it tighten up?

1348
02:32:30,760 --> 02:32:32,842
Did it have many wrinkles?

1349
02:32:33,880 --> 02:32:35,803
Was it sufficiently wet?

1350
02:32:35,840 --> 02:32:39,208
The viscosity and transparency
of her vaginal secretion?

1351
02:32:40,880 --> 02:32:43,531
Please, one more cigarette, sir.

1352
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:15,325
<i>Spider thread pulled into strings...</i>

1353
02:33:17,240 --> 02:33:22,565
<i>I dare say
no book has ever described</i>

1354
02:33:22,720 --> 02:33:24,722
<i>such a ferocious wedding night.</i>

1355
02:33:28,480 --> 02:33:32,769
<i>I thought I heard a nightingale sing.</i>

1356
02:34:06,960 --> 02:34:11,648
<i>And the clear,
bright crimson blood!</i>

1357
02:34:21,120 --> 02:34:23,487
<i>Thus the Lady became my wife.</i>

1358
02:34:23,920 --> 02:34:27,606
<i>Coy one moment, bold the next...</i>

1359
02:34:31,560 --> 02:34:36,248
But how was she coy,

1360
02:34:36,320 --> 02:34:40,450
how was she bold, tell it to me in detail!

1361
02:34:41,120 --> 02:34:43,930
A story is all about the journey.

1362
02:34:44,400 --> 02:34:46,801
You should know.

1363
02:34:48,320 --> 02:34:50,049
Did she resist?

1364
02:34:51,160 --> 02:34:53,766
So did you pinch her ass as punishment?

1365
02:34:54,040 --> 02:34:57,965
Or did she spit at you in contempt?

1366
02:34:58,400 --> 02:35:00,050
<font color="#ffff00">Or else...</font>

1367
02:35:00,760 --> 02:35:03,081
Did she beg you to do it?

1368
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:07,402
Like <i>the lady in
<font color="#ffff00">'The Widow's Lapdog?'</font></i>

1369
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:12,331
How dare you!

1370
02:35:12,360 --> 02:35:14,362
Hideko is my wife.

1371
02:35:14,800 --> 02:35:19,362
What kind of scoundrel rattles on
about his wedding night!

1372
02:36:55,440 --> 02:36:56,487
It's odd...

1373
02:36:58,400 --> 02:37:00,004
Your smoke.

1374
02:37:02,720 --> 02:37:05,883
It's cold, blue,

1375
02:37:07,400 --> 02:37:13,407
<font color="#ffff00">and strangely beautiful.</font>

1376
02:37:14,640 --> 02:37:21,569
You too have become soft,
slow and dull.

1377
02:37:23,160 --> 02:37:26,323
Mercury is most deadly
in its gaseous state.

1378
02:37:27,120 --> 02:37:29,441
One cigarette would have sufficed.

1379
02:37:33,160 --> 02:37:37,529
At least I will die with my cock intact.

1380
02:44:20,160 --> 02:44:24,370
<i>I hear a sound in the distance</i>

1381
02:44:24,440 --> 02:44:28,650
<i>that sounds like the steps of my love</i>

1382
02:44:28,720 --> 02:44:32,930
<i>An echo that makes my heart</i>

1383
02:44:32,960 --> 02:44:36,282
<i>Skip a beat</i>

1384
02:44:37,120 --> 02:44:41,603
<i>But I wait all through the night</i>

1385
02:44:41,640 --> 02:44:45,247
<i>And my love never comes to me</i>

1386
02:44:45,880 --> 02:44:50,124
<i>There is no end to the heartache</i>

1387
02:44:50,160 --> 02:44:53,846
<i>That grips me in this hour</i>

1388
02:44:54,440 --> 02:44:58,206
<i>Waiting for the footsteps of</i>

1389
02:44:58,640 --> 02:45:01,883
<i>My dear love</i>

1390
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:06,800
<i>Waiting for the footsteps of</i>

1391
02:45:07,200 --> 02:45:11,046
<i>My dear love</i>

1392
02:45:28,680 --> 02:45:32,890
<i>But then in my waiting heart</i>

1393
02:45:32,920 --> 02:45:37,209
<i>Suddenly happiness overflows</i>

1394
02:45:37,280 --> 02:45:41,490
<i>There you are in the distance</i>

1395
02:45:41,520 --> 02:45:45,320
<i>Coming to me</i>

1396
02:45:45,800 --> 02:45:50,044
<i>Filled with dreams of a new life</i>

1397
02:45:50,080 --> 02:45:53,926
<i>Filled with happiness</i>

1398
02:45:54,400 --> 02:45:58,246
<i>Inside my waiting heart</i>

1399
02:45:58,680 --> 02:46:02,401
<i>Flowers start to bloom</i>

1400
02:46:02,960 --> 02:46:06,760
<i>Come my lover, come to me</i>

1401
02:46:07,200 --> 02:46:10,727
<i>I missed you so</i>

1402
02:46:11,520 --> 02:46:15,081
<i>Let's dream of happy times</i>

1403
02:46:15,760 --> 02:46:19,890
<i>Like long ago</i>

1404
02:46:37,200 --> 02:46:41,410
<i>Filled with dreams of a new life</i>

1405
02:46:41,440 --> 02:46:45,286
<i>Filled with happiness</i>

1406
02:46:45,800 --> 02:46:49,600
<i>Inside my waiting heart</i>

1407
02:46:50,040 --> 02:46:53,806
<i>Flowers start to bloom</i>

1408
02:46:54,320 --> 02:46:58,120
<i>Waiting for the footsteps of</i>

1409
02:46:58,600 --> 02:47:02,082
<i>My dear love</i>

1410
02:47:02,920 --> 02:47:06,561
<i>Waiting for the footsteps of</i>

1411
02:47:07,200 --> 02:47:11,285
<i>My dear love</i>
