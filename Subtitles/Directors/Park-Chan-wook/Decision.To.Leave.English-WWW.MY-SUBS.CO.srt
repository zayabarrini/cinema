7
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,590
We should catch them.

- Yeah.

10
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:47,630
So G-goo came on his own,

00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,540
wanting a refund of a prepaid
card he bought last year?

12
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:52,920
Right. We don't normally do that.

13
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
But I told him I'd ask my boss,

Quite a shocking wife.

101
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:08,640
Tell her an autopsy is standard

102
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,430
for an unaccountable
death without witnesses.

103

104

I doubt my wife would
be shocked, either.

105
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:27,470
She'd say, "I knew it."

106
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,310
"That's why I didn't
want to marry a cop."

Is that easy enough?

112
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:47,760
Make it easier.

113
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:50,890
I told her to report it,

114
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:53,300
that broken ribs are
no laughing matter.

115
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:55,680
But then she just laughed again.

116
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:59,190
He's the neat, orderly type.

117

A lacerated scalp was
the cause of death.

128
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:44,640
His head bone was broken.
That's why he died.

129
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:46,360
He must've bled a lot,

130
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,670
but the rain washed it away,

131
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:49,310
fortunately.

132
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:52,770
He perished as he wished.

133
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:58,690
Isn't "perished" correct?

134
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:01,810
Did you see her laugh?

135
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:04,560
He was a very neat man.

00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:11,060
Song Seo-rae...

170
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:15,230
On Mondays, it's Granny Hae-dong!

171
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:17,730
And we called her that day.

172
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:18,970
Sorry,

173
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:20,900
but if patients can't
express themselves,

174
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,940
how can they answer the phone?

175
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:26,110
The caregiver answers!

176
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,860
How is Ms. Song's work performance?

177
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,410
The grannies all talk
about her like this.

178
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:40,690
"Is she a caregiver
or my granddaughter?"

179
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,230
She was a nurse, so
she's great at injections.

180
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,610
She's our company's ace.

181
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:54,240
That's a scary woman.

182
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:57,240
She took her ring off already.

183
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,530
Whereas grief envelops
some like a crashing wave,

184
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:10,740
there are some to
whom it spreads slowly,

185
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:13,650
like ink in water.

186
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,540
Tell me when your
poetry book comes out.

187
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,230
I'll buy a copy.

188
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:20,820
You don't know the bitterness of life.

189
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:24,180
Sure, weekends with your pretty wife

190
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:26,400
must be so bitter.

191
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,190
<i>It's hard to spend 12 hours a day</i>

192
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:31,490
<i>at my desk on illegal entry cases.</i>

193
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:33,780
<i>But just the thought
of scaling the rock face</i>

194
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:37,730
<i>makes my heart sing!</i>

195
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,030
They found someone else's DNA

196
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:45,070
under Ki Do-soo's fingernails.

197
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:49,230
We'll need an oral epithelial
cell sample from his wife.

198
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:52,280
"Oral epithelial cell sample"?

199
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:54,150
How do I make that phrase easy?

200
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:58,570
Just thinking about it

201
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:02,030
makes my stomach's
epithelial cells ache.

202
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:03,740
Go eat lunch.

203
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:06,150
Nothing too expensive!

204
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:53,820
Another person's DNA was found

205
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:56,580
under Ki Do-soo's fingernails.

206
00:15:56,660 --> 00:16:02,290
We need you to come to the
station now and give us your DNA.

207
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:04,250
<i>I can't.</i>

208
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:06,830
- Why not?
<i>- I'm working.</i>

209
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:08,380
Your husband died,

210
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:10,780
but you're already back at work?

211
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,200
Taking care of living old people

212
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:18,030
comes before my dead husband.

213
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,240
I see.

214
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:25,410
<i>But tailing is my specialty.</i>

215
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:26,560
Your grandmother raised you.

216
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,160
That's why it's your job.

217
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,490
Do it right.

218
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:35,450
Last Monday, what time did
Song Seo-rae leave your home?

219
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,740
Siri, play me a song.

220
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,870
"The Mist" by Chung Hoon-hee.

221
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,610
Isn't this song great?

222
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:50,530
Seo-rae put it on for me.

223
00:16:51,910 --> 00:17:00,330
♪ I walk alone ♪

224
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:06,200
♪ on the street ♪

225
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:10,780
♪ filled with mist ♪

226
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:16,200
♪ Is that your silhouette ♪

227
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:20,750
I didn't think you could come.

228
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,740
Thank you.

229
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,160
Why do you like Seo-rae so much?

230
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,290
Because she's pretty?

231
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:36,530
Because she doesn't take half
the apple off while peeling it.

232
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:41,120
I start praying on Friday night

233
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,360
for Monday to come quickly.

234
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:48,910
And sometimes, Monday
seems to come faster.

235
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:55,610
Siri, play me a song.

236
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:58,360
"The Mist" by Chung Hoon-hee.

237
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:02,330
Isn't this song great?

238
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,110
Seo-rae put it on for me.

239
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:09,240
We fought.

240
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:14,030
He said let's go to the mountain.
I said I hate the mountain.

241
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:15,550
He scratched his wife

242
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:18,370
for hating the mountain?

243
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:24,440
I'll call a female officer.

244
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:26,860
It's okay.

245
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:29,030
We need to take a photo.

246
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:41,740
It's okay.

247
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:52,610
It's okay.

248
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:04,150
I did it.

249
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,460
Because he just wasn't
understanding Korean.

250
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:11,010
After you hurt yourself,
did he understand?

251
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:12,660
At last.

252
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:15,500
What did he say when you hurt yourself?

253
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,460
You heartless woman.

254
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:30,040
Do-soo tried to stop me, like this...

255
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:33,250
So you're saying

256
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:37,580
that's why your DNA is under
your husband's fingernails?

257
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:40,670
Do you hate mountains that much?

258
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:52,370
<i>Confucius said,</i>

259
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:54,040
<i>"Wise people like water."</i>

260
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,670
<i>"Benevolent people like mountains."</i>

261
00:19:56,750 --> 00:20:00,170
<i>I am not benevolent. I like the sea.</i>

262
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,740
Me, too.

263
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,290
Sorry?

264
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:10,910
These are the dates you
went to the emergency room?

265
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:13,550
Did he hit you then

266
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:15,370
for not going to the mountain?

267
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:18,380
He was the solitary Korean person

268
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:22,740
to listen to my story and cry.

269
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,500
What Korean person?

270
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:29,000
Solitary?

271
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:39,210
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have laughed.

272
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,620
But your expression was so precise.

273
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:47,340
When I have no confidence in Korean,

274
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:49,290
I laugh.

275
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:02,120
I'll order dinner.

276
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,870
Everything okay?

277
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:30,370
Thank you. Did you eat?

278
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:31,660
No.

279
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:43,620
Isn't that the Shima Sushi
premium dinner combo?

280
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,210
Is that covered?

281
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:48,330
Damn!

282
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:20,160
Follow me.

283
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:28,530
We'll be coming back.

284
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:42,840
It's waterproof.

285
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:47,220
"Waterproof" means if it
gets wet, water won't come in.

286
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:53,300
Caregivers use many
waterproof products.

287
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,450
Be back in that room

288
00:22:58,530 --> 00:22:59,670
by 6:50.

289
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:02,920
The women's restroom
is that way, on the right.

290
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:49,040
On August 17th, 2015,

291
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:53,210
the Coast Guard caught a
group of Chinese nationals

292
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:57,000
stowed on a cargo
ship at Pyeongtaek Port.

293
00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:00,210
The other 37 were deported,

294
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:02,380
but only you remained in Korea.

295
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:07,710
Because I'm different from them.

296
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,670
My grandfather was

297
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:14,220
Gye Bong-seok of the Korean
Liberation Army in Manchuria.

298
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,920
What?

299
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,380
- Huh?
- Eh?

300
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:26,010
Thanks to Do-soo,

301
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:29,210
he got an Order of Merit
for National Foundation.

306
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:54,340
G-goo showed up at Oppa Internet Cafe.

307
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:56,170
Send Ms. Song home,

308
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:59,590
and check up on Gye
Bong-seok and his medal.

309
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:00,630

00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:45,090
Fighting you, I could tell
you can't kill someone.

335
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:48,510
It was San-o who killed Beom, right?

336
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:51,390
You guys will never catch San-o.

337
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:52,630
Why not?

338
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:55,800
His memories of juvie
are just too beautiful.

339
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:58,470
He'll kill himself

340
00:28:58,550 --> 00:29:01,380
and a bunch of you
rather than go to jail.

341
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,670
The suicidal type.

342
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:21,600
Didn't I tell you no brutality
if you work with me?

343
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:25,600
He injured a police officer!

344
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:29,020
I injured it while hitting him!

345
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:31,440
Why carry a gun

346
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,060
if you're too out of shape to run?

347
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:37,420
And don't do all the talking.

348
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,440
Make them talk!

349
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,140
Don't you listen to
them a little too much?

350
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,020
Take Song Seo-rae.

351
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,810
We should've gotten a search
warrant on her already.

352
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:50,280
Mee-jee, a true police
officer, checked the CCTV.

353
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:53,270
Seo-rae was filmed going in and
out of that granny's apartment.

354
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:01,060
Her alibi is solid.

355
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,900
Mee-jee,

356
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:06,480
didn't you say San-o
has a lot of women?

357
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:08,100
Make a list.

358
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:10,350
When they dated and so on.

359
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:13,020
And find their current addresses.

360
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,070
Why should such a beautiful woman

361
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:19,110
marry an old man in Korea?

362
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:22,230
If she's young,
beautiful, and a foreigner,

363
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:24,180
does that make her a murder suspect?

364
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:27,110
So you admit she's beautiful?

365
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:28,730
It's reverse discrimination.

366
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:30,580
What if she were not
female, not a foreigner

367
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:32,110
but just a Korean man?

368
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:35,100
Wouldn't you be staking her out?

369
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:37,900
Aren't stakeouts your hobby?

370
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:40,220
That and preaching.

371
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:02,310
Leaving the ice cream out,

372
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:03,400
sleeping uncomfortably

373
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,140
with the TV still on.

374
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:51,220
Good morning.

375
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,150
Good morning!

376
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:01,930
What's with the pleasant greeting?
You trying to confuse us?

377
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:04,560
I slept unusually well.

378
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,200
<i>Another crow?</i>

379
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,200
<i>To thank me for feeding you?</i>

380
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,660
<i>No need for that.</i>

381
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:17,650
<i>If you must give me a present,</i>

382
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:20,480
<i>bring me the head
of that kind detective.</i>

383
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:22,780
<i>That's what I want.</i>

384
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,400
Ice cream for dinner again.

385
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,690
Don't smoke after meals.

386
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,440
Crying... at last.

387
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:04,780
Good mor...

388
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,270
What?

389
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:18,650
Good morning, sir.

390
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:24,190
Are you still stuck on
that Guso Mountain case?

391
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:30,780
Wrap it up quickly and move
on to something bigger,

392
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,860
like the Jilgok District case!

393
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:36,690
God, he's frustrating.

394
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,200
You're wrapping up the
Guso Mountain case?

395
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,990
What's this Chinese document?

396
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,890
The investigation's not finished.

397
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,020
But there's no reason to expect murder.

398
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:21,900
I want to go catch the
Jilgok District murderer now.

399
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:24,450
Song Seo-rae is suspected of murder.

400
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:27,230
If she goes back to China,
she'll get a life sentence.

401
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:30,980
I even got it translated
and sent it to you.

402
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:38,350
How many of San-o's
girlfriends did you meet?

403
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:41,070
Meet them all in two
days and write up a report.

404
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:42,780
Damn it!

405
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:47,980
Hey!

406
00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:53,320
Look at this. She
killed her own mother!

407
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:01,190
What were you doing out in the cold?

408
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,820
Thinking how much I like the misty sea?

409
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:08,990
In Busan, there's the sea.
In Ipo, there's the sea...

410
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:11,450
I'm just a man of the sea!

411
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:13,040
Man of the sea, my butt.

412
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:15,070
You were born in downtown Seoul.

413
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:18,490
God, I want a cigarette.

414
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:25,610
Eliminate that dirty thought
before it's too late!

415
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:30,450
I'll get some bellflower root.

416
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:32,450
Chewing on it helped you quit.

417
00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:36,570
Hi, June? It's me.

418
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:38,410
Do you have any bellflower root?

419
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:42,210
My husband says he feels like smoking.

420
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:45,570
He must've forgotten
how hard it was to quit.

421
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,620
<i>SONG SEO-RAE</i>

422
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:00,950
<i>THOUGHTS?</i>

423
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,530
<i>THOUGHTS?</i>

424
00:37:04,610 --> 00:37:05,530
<i>THOUGHTS.</i>

425
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:10,620
<i>TELL ME YOUR THOUGHTS.</i>

426
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,710
<i>COME TO MY HOME.</i>

427
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:14,780
<i>ARE YOU KIDDING ME?</i>

428
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:35,900
You think you can order
a cop to your house?

429
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:40,240
Don't you come here often anyway?

430
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:43,740
So you killed your mother?

431
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:50,870
Homi Mountain

432
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:55,490
is in your grandfather's
hometown in Korea.

433
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:58,360
It belongs to him.

434
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,420
Go there,

435
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:04,560
to your mountain.

436
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:11,280
After killing me first.

437
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:13,860
Mom,

438
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:16,160
the reason I became a nurse was

439
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,160
to care for you professionally.

440
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,950
Now, you want me to

441
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:22,190
kill you professionally,

442
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:24,410
as a nurse?

443
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:28,120
So I did as she wished.

444
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,620
It took just four capsules of fentanyl.

445
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:33,530
And I kept four for myself.

446
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:37,950
Where is it? The fentanyl?

447
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:46,070
Open if you're curious.

448
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:58,320
Do-soo was suicide.

449
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:01,570
<i>I KNOW</i>

450
00:39:01,650 --> 00:39:04,240
<i>YOU ACCEPTED BRIBES
FROM ILLEGAL ALIENS</i>

451
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,070
<i>SO THEY CAN GET CITIZENSHIP...</i>

452
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:08,410
<i>IF YOU DON'T ANSWER,
I WILL REPORT YOU.</i>

453
00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:10,620
Fine.

454
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:15,070
Mr. Ki Do-soo

455
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:16,910
stared at people's faces

456
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:19,790
and stamped passports for 20 years

457
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:21,280
with a blank expression.

458
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,400
He didn't have a single friend.

459
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,740
Why marry a man...

460
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:42,830
<i>I spent ten days at sea
in the heat of summer</i>

461
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:44,670
<i>in a fish storage bin.</i>

462
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:46,840
<i>My face was like a skull,</i>

463
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,460
<i>smeared with feces.</i>

464
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:51,080
<i>I was rocking back and
forth like a mad person.</i>

465
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:00,080
<i>He saw me,</i>

466
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,660
<i>he smelled me,</i>

467
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:03,240
<i>and he listened to me.</i>

468
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:11,370
<i>Does your wife know whose home</i>

469
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:12,950
<i>you stare into late at night?</i>

470
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:16,380
"I cannot bear to live

471
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:18,540
with this false charge of corruption."

472
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:19,980
"Whatever it takes,"

473
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:22,290
"I will soon prove my innocence"

474
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:24,540
"and restore my honor."

475
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:27,600
It reads like a suicide note,

476
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:30,200
so I should've told the police,

477
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:32,750
but to expose my former boss...

478
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:34,790
- I see.
- I'm so sorry!

479
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:39,120
Suicide, you sure?

480
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,330
We got his suicide note!

481
00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:44,670
You're as bad as those other damn cops!

482
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:46,730
Come on.

483
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:48,210
He's our youngest-ever inspector.

484
00:40:48,290 --> 00:40:49,730
If he's as bad as
those other damn cops,

485
00:40:49,810 --> 00:40:50,990
I'll dance a jig.

486
00:40:57,790 --> 00:41:00,330
Of course, killing her mom

487
00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:03,080
isn't proof she killed her husband.

488
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:05,700
But you said it once yourself.

489
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:09,570
Killing is like smoking.

490
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:13,200
Only the first time is hard.

491
00:41:20,330 --> 00:41:21,330
Hello?

492
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:24,160
My apologies.

493
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:28,740
Hey, Soo-wan.

494
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:31,160
Soo-wan! Let's go.

495
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:32,870
Okay?

496
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:36,250
Come on, you idiot!

497
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:39,070
- Oh, hi!
- Get up.

498
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:43,120
What happened here?

499
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,750
- Let's go.
- Huh?

500
00:41:45,790 --> 00:41:48,370
Our inspector may look like a pushover,

501
00:41:48,450 --> 00:41:50,330
but he's fierce.

502
00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:53,210
- He'll catch you next time...
- Hey, let's go.

503
00:41:53,290 --> 00:41:55,090
So be wary

504
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,790
when you kill your next husband.

505
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:02,040
- Bro, your bag.
- Never mind that. Just come on!

506
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,500
Were my words easy enough?

507
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:07,460
I came all the way to Busan
because I respect you.

508
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:08,620
Don't.

509
00:42:08,910 --> 00:42:10,700
- Let me ask one thing.
- Don't.

510
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:13,210
Why did you buy her sushi?

511
00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:14,410
Shut up!

512
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:21,990
Could you...

513
00:42:33,330 --> 00:42:35,380
The case is closed.

514
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:39,070
You're no longer a suspect.

515
00:42:40,450 --> 00:42:41,990
Are you happy?

516
00:42:42,430 --> 00:42:45,870
Why would I be?

517
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:51,790
Yes, I'm happy.

518
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:54,970
Why?

519
00:42:57,670 --> 00:43:01,170
Well, now, we no longer...

520
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:02,550
We?

521
00:43:21,590 --> 00:43:23,590
Did you eat dinner?

522
00:43:25,090 --> 00:43:26,790
Yes.

523
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,590
Ice cream?

524
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:39,630
This is the "solitary"
Chinese food I can cook.

525
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,390
I do things at night
because of insomnia.

526
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:57,170
<i>CHINESE FOR BEGINNERS</i>

527
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:04,970
"Insomnia" means you can't sleep.

528
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,130
Unresolved cases.

529
00:44:22,210 --> 00:44:24,970
I never know when to take them down...

530
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:30,960
"Unresolved" means we
didn't catch the criminal.

531
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,880
Unresolved...

532
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:37,750
Do ants eat people?

533
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,170
Oh, that...

534
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:43,010
The first to appear are the blowflies.

535
00:44:43,090 --> 00:44:45,660
Whether it's day or night,
they arrive in ten minutes.

536
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:48,210
They consume blood or excretions

537
00:44:48,290 --> 00:44:51,340
and lay eggs in any wound or orifice.

538
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:52,970
When maggots hatch,

539
00:44:53,050 --> 00:44:55,000
that's when the ants
arrive to eat them.

540
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:58,420
After that are the beetles and wasps.

541
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:00,340
They all feast on the body.

542
00:45:14,410 --> 00:45:17,210
This is Chinese food?

543
00:45:20,630 --> 00:45:22,090
But the taste is good.

544
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:27,340
This is why you can't sleep.

545
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:31,210
Because those bleeding
photos are screaming wildly.

546
00:45:33,010 --> 00:45:36,500
That guy Beom was found on a
mountain a month after his death.

547
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:40,290
The hatchet that smashed
his head was next to him.

548
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:43,500
San-o. He's the killer for sure,

549
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:45,290
but we can't find him.

550
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:49,170
Whenever I have time, I look into him.

551
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:53,220
After interviewing a
dozen of his ex-girlfriends,

552
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:55,330
I feel like we're close.

553
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:00,000
He's been to jail?

554
00:46:00,330 --> 00:46:02,590
Yes, just for a month.

555
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:04,540
He thought some guy
was seeing his girlfriend,

556
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:06,290
so he beat him up.

557
00:46:06,370 --> 00:46:08,750
When he fears jail more than death?

558
00:46:10,710 --> 00:46:11,550
You're right.

559
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:14,510
He beat the guy,
knowing he'd go to jail...

560
00:46:14,590 --> 00:46:17,130
So he loves that woman more than death.

561
00:46:26,430 --> 00:46:27,880
Oh Ga-in?

562
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:46,800
He went up. Go!

563
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:48,340
Go!

564
00:46:51,430 --> 00:46:52,510
Bro!

565
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:57,050
I turned the cylinder!

566
00:47:01,390 --> 00:47:03,710
<i>Oh Ga-in lives far away.</i>

567
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:07,800
<i>She runs a beauty parlor in Gyeonggi.</i>

568
00:47:10,510 --> 00:47:12,210
Also, she's married.

569
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:28,260
In Korea, if a person
you love gets married,

570
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:31,140
does the love cease?

571
00:47:44,510 --> 00:47:47,090
Hey! San-o! San-o!

572
00:48:22,090 --> 00:48:28,100
You didn't kill Beom for money. Right?

573
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:29,720
I know everything.

574
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:31,590
During your month in jail,

575
00:48:31,670 --> 00:48:34,550
Beom made a move on Ga-in, right?

576
00:48:44,510 --> 00:48:47,380
Actually, I like a woman, too.

577
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,460
But her husband beats her.

578
00:48:51,710 --> 00:48:54,050
I want to kill that
jerk so much it hurts!

579
00:48:55,670 --> 00:48:59,180
Why is it that women
sleep with such trash?

580
00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:00,380
Though I'm trash, too.

581
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:02,090
Exactly!

582
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:06,840
But you're not trash.

583
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:11,380
You really love Ga-in, right?

584
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:14,760
You gave up everything for her!

585
00:49:15,090 --> 00:49:16,050
And...

586
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:31,880
Tell Ga-in...

587
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:38,730
"I went through hell because of you."

588
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:46,190
"But without you, my
life would be empty."

589
00:49:46,730 --> 00:49:48,440
Tell her that.

590
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:56,440
San-o, don't do it!

591
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:00,850
No need to tell her.

592
00:50:05,430 --> 00:50:06,640
<i>Are you okay?</i>

593
00:50:06,890 --> 00:50:09,520
<i>How could they expect you to drive home</i>

594
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:11,350
<i>after something like that?</i>

595
00:50:11,430 --> 00:50:12,480
<i>Shall I go to Busan?</i>

596
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:14,730
No, no need.

597
00:50:14,810 --> 00:50:17,860
<i>- Still, when you're depressed...</i>
- I'm not depressed.

598
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:20,470
<i>- Really?</i>
- I need to go to the bathroom.

599
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:22,640
<i>- Okay.</i>
- Bye.

600
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:35,230
<i>After a two-year search,</i>

601
00:50:35,310 --> 00:50:37,940
<i>he located the woman,
murdered her husband,</i>

602
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:41,390
<i>and subsequently began living with her.</i>

603
00:50:42,930 --> 00:50:44,100
Who is it?

604
00:50:45,930 --> 00:50:47,350
Honey?

605
00:50:48,430 --> 00:50:51,350
I told you you don't have to...

606
00:50:51,430 --> 00:50:53,220
Why are you here?

607
00:50:54,270 --> 00:50:55,810
To put you to sleep.

608
00:50:57,230 --> 00:50:59,430
Am I one of your grannies?

609
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:01,930
Will you massage my arms?

610
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:05,480
What are you doing?

611
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:10,140
You said you take them
down when you solve them.

612
00:51:25,850 --> 00:51:27,600
I'll burn my husband, too.

613
00:51:59,890 --> 00:52:02,100
This is so dark.

614
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:05,390
Still, it's pretty.

615
00:52:26,690 --> 00:52:28,720
What did you say I was?

616
00:52:31,850 --> 00:52:33,220
Say it in Chinese.

617
00:52:43,470 --> 00:52:44,430
Pretty.

618
00:52:49,470 --> 00:52:51,140
Your silhouette.

619
00:52:55,140 --> 00:52:58,010
Then let's leave that one.

620
00:53:03,730 --> 00:53:05,110
And this one.

621
00:53:05,570 --> 00:53:07,060
Leave this, too.

622
00:53:10,730 --> 00:53:12,270
And this one.

623
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:17,060
This one's better.

624
00:53:28,770 --> 00:53:31,860
Will you sleep soundly now?

625
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:34,780
I'm not sure.

626
00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:38,810
I have a method.

627
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:40,400
A method?

628
00:53:41,190 --> 00:53:42,850
The US Navy developed it,

629
00:53:42,930 --> 00:53:45,560
and I improved it.

630
00:53:46,310 --> 00:53:48,020
I served in the Korean Navy.

631
00:53:50,270 --> 00:53:53,190
What did the US Navy develop?

632
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:56,600
Close your eyes.

633
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:06,980
Why did you ask the cat for my head?

634
00:54:07,060 --> 00:54:08,150
Your head?

635
00:54:08,230 --> 00:54:09,940
What will you do with it?

636
00:54:11,650 --> 00:54:17,390
I said heart, not head.

637
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:22,150
Let's start.

638
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:30,860
Listen to my breathing.

639
00:54:31,820 --> 00:54:36,480
Match your breathing and mine.

640
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:53,360
Now, you go into the sea.

641
00:54:53,690 --> 00:54:55,730
You go deep.

642
00:54:59,310 --> 00:55:03,900
You are a jellyfish.

643
00:55:04,310 --> 00:55:07,850
You have no eyes or nose.

644
00:55:08,730 --> 00:55:11,480
You have no thoughts.

645
00:55:14,430 --> 00:55:15,560
No joy

646
00:55:16,190 --> 00:55:17,270
and no sadness.

647
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:19,770
You feel no emotion.

648
00:55:21,650 --> 00:55:23,890
As you push away the water,

649
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:27,860
you push away all that happened today

650
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:29,440
to me.

651
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:50,110
Korean women have
such soft hands, right?

652
00:55:51,190 --> 00:55:54,680
Don't caregivers wear gloves?

653
00:55:55,180 --> 00:55:56,810
It's so calloused.

654
00:56:00,610 --> 00:56:02,930
I liked it from the start,

655
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:07,060
that my detective was so dignified.

656
00:56:07,350 --> 00:56:09,650
Dignified for a cop, you mean?

657
00:56:12,530 --> 00:56:14,600
Dignified for a Korean?

658
00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:16,600
For a man?

659
00:56:20,610 --> 00:56:22,600
For a modern person.

660
00:56:26,740 --> 00:56:29,160
What era do you come from anyway?

661
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:31,660
The Tang Dynasty?

662
00:56:33,570 --> 00:56:36,650
Why is it you don't
ask me why I like you?

663
00:56:36,990 --> 00:56:39,240
Scared you'll think of it too much?

664
00:56:39,780 --> 00:56:41,920
From the start,

665
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,940
I knew we were of the same breed.

666
00:56:46,450 --> 00:56:48,910
When you said you'd look
at your husband's photo.

667
00:56:52,030 --> 00:56:53,610
That you didn't want "words."

668
00:56:56,320 --> 00:57:00,870
I always try to look
at things directly, too.

669
00:57:06,610 --> 00:57:08,530
Half the corpses at crime scenes

670
00:57:08,630 --> 00:57:11,120
have their eyes open.

671
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:13,320
I promise them

672
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:15,990
I'll catch the killer who
was the last thing they saw.

673
00:57:21,330 --> 00:57:25,150
What scares me are crime
scenes with lots of blood.

674
00:57:25,610 --> 00:57:27,410
Because of the smell.

675
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:38,910
That's why you carry hand
cream that smells nice?

676
00:57:43,940 --> 00:57:45,530
What else do you carry?

677
00:58:05,820 --> 00:58:07,950
What scares you, Seo-rae?

678
00:58:08,030 --> 00:58:10,160
You're a nurse, so it can't be blood.

679
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:11,770
High places.

680
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:17,530
Your pockets...

681
00:58:17,610 --> 00:58:19,700
Twelve on the jacket, six on my pants.

682
00:58:19,950 --> 00:58:21,610
Custom-made at my tailor.

683
00:58:21,690 --> 00:58:22,740
I solved a case for him once,

684
00:58:22,820 --> 00:58:24,110
so I get a discount.

685
00:58:24,190 --> 00:58:25,780
I have to go at once when I get called,

686
00:58:25,860 --> 00:58:27,490
so I wear these even on days off.

687
00:58:27,950 --> 00:58:30,160
People don't stop murdering
on the weekends, you know.

688
00:58:31,270 --> 00:58:32,530
But I don't wear the
same clothes every day.

689
00:58:32,610 --> 00:58:34,690
I have several pairs. I'm...

690
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:41,480
Clean.

691
00:58:43,530 --> 00:58:46,450
<i>She writes for hours</i>

692
00:58:46,530 --> 00:58:48,950

00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:50,730

00:58:51,110 --> 00:58:53,280
<i>Looks things up on her phone.</i>

695
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:56,700
<i>Perhaps translating with a dictionary?</i>

696
00:58:56,780 --> 00:58:58,990
<i>Watching TV again.</i>

697
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:01,440
<i>Talks to herself while watching.</i>

698
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:03,110
<i>Is it those historical shows</i>

699
00:59:03,190 --> 00:59:05,570
<i>that make her speech so classical?</i>

700
00:59:05,650 --> 00:59:07,740
<i>Ice cream for dinner again.</i>

701
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:10,740
<i>Don't smoke after meals.</i>

702
00:59:10,820 --> 00:59:13,440
<i>Crying... at last.</i>

703
00:59:17,780 --> 00:59:18,910
Damn it.

704
00:59:20,020 --> 00:59:21,520
I know you're swearing.

705
00:59:22,570 --> 00:59:24,530
In front of Buddha, no less...

706
00:59:36,110 --> 00:59:39,030
You delete the files
after a case is solved?

707
00:59:39,860 --> 00:59:41,150
Sure.

708
00:59:57,330 --> 00:59:59,070
The day your mother died?

709
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:05,580
It often helps to remember
numbers related to a case.

710
01:00:11,490 --> 01:00:13,450
Since the case is closed,

711
01:00:15,250 --> 01:00:16,710
I'll forget them.

01:00:54,750 --> 01:00:57,120
How do you know such an old song?

01:00:57,370 --> 01:00:59,480

Thirty leagues to the
east is Oil Mountain.

749

This mountain's peak
is so deeply hidden.

750
01:04:04,870 --> 01:04:07,250
For those who don't
seek it out, it's invisible.

You're a man,

01:04:09,830 --> 01:04:13,630
but your hands are
softer than Seo-rae's.

Seo-rae's hands are a bit rough.

These days, yes.

755
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:26,790
Her palms used to be as soft as lips.

Sirae, play me a song!

757

"The Mist" by... who is it?

758
01:04:36,870 --> 01:04:40,380
She doesn't listen to me these days.

759
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:44,250
The same phone as Seo-rae's.

760
01:04:44,330 --> 01:04:46,960
Sure, we bought them together.

761

828
01:11:35,850 --> 01:11:38,800
Is that why you sent him
those threatening letters?

829
01:11:42,890 --> 01:11:45,650
They would've come anyway.

830
01:11:45,730 --> 01:11:49,310
The bribes were all true.

831
01:11:49,390 --> 01:11:51,850
<i>IF YOU DON'T ANSWER,
I WILL REPORT YOU.</i>

832
01:11:53,850 --> 01:11:55,900
Then you must've forged his letter

833
01:11:55,980 --> 01:11:57,720
to the immigration office, too.

834
01:11:58,470 --> 01:11:59,540
The address on the envelope was

835
01:11:59,620 --> 01:12:00,970
in his handwriting.

836
01:12:02,140 --> 01:12:03,310
How did you do that?

837
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:28,680
<i>SENDER KI DO-SOO</i>

838
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:29,760
<i>RECIPIENT IMMIGRATION OFFICE</i>

839
01:12:32,100 --> 01:12:35,310
I just fixed the contents of his letter

840
01:12:36,550 --> 01:12:39,930
to give it a feel of a will.

841
01:12:40,010 --> 01:12:42,430
When you said Soo-wan was violent,

842
01:12:42,510 --> 01:12:44,020
that must've been a lie, too.

843
01:12:47,010 --> 01:12:49,930
If a policeman gets drunk
and enters a woman's home,

844
01:12:50,010 --> 01:12:51,890
isn't that violence?

845
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:57,240
Burning the photos,

846
01:12:57,620 --> 01:13:00,270
erasing my voice recordings.

847
01:13:00,350 --> 01:13:02,100
It must've been so easy.

848
01:13:02,350 --> 01:13:03,990
"Give it a feel" that you like me,

849
01:13:05,890 --> 01:13:08,640
and I do it all for you?

850
01:13:17,430 --> 01:13:20,300
Don't speak about our time that way.

851
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:22,650
Our time?

852
01:13:23,780 --> 01:13:25,310
What kind of time was that?

853
01:13:28,730 --> 01:13:33,650
The time I spent outside
your home each night?

854
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:38,600
The time I slept so well
listening to you breathe?

855
01:13:39,860 --> 01:13:42,690
The time I embraced you
and whispered I was happy?

856
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:02,070
You said I was dignified?

857
01:14:04,470 --> 01:14:06,810
You know where dignity comes from?

858
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:09,860
From pride.

859
01:14:11,150 --> 01:14:13,280
I was a proud police officer.

860
01:14:14,430 --> 01:14:15,770
But...

861
01:14:18,190 --> 01:14:19,810
I went crazy for a woman

862
01:14:24,350 --> 01:14:26,180
and ruined an investigation.

863
01:14:29,150 --> 01:14:30,480
Now...

864
01:14:34,980 --> 01:14:36,850
I'm completely shattered.

865
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:46,470
I bought Granny a new phone.

866
01:14:47,260 --> 01:14:48,650
The same model.

867
01:14:49,900 --> 01:14:51,360
She has no idea.

868
01:14:55,140 --> 01:14:56,940
Throw that phone in the sea.

869
01:15:00,690 --> 01:15:02,440
Someplace deep,

870
01:15:02,910 --> 01:15:05,020
where no one can find it.

871
01:15:42,350 --> 01:15:48,860
<i>SHATTERED</i>

872
01:15:48,940 --> 01:15:52,640
<i>1. RUINED OR BROKEN.</i>

873
01:16:12,310 --> 01:16:13,310
<i>THIRTEEN MONTHS LATER</i>

874
01:16:13,390 --> 01:16:16,810
The stress from losing
criminals and so on

875
01:16:16,890 --> 01:16:18,690
can cause sleep disorders.

876
01:16:19,060 --> 01:16:21,480
My first recommendation

877
01:16:21,970 --> 01:16:25,350
is to sunbathe 30 minutes before noon.

878
01:16:25,640 --> 01:16:26,890
You can wear clothes,

879
01:16:26,970 --> 01:16:28,810
but keep your eyes open...

880
01:16:29,270 --> 01:16:31,020
Doctor.

881
01:16:31,470 --> 01:16:33,890
You haven't worked
long in Ipo, have you?

882
01:16:37,020 --> 01:16:40,150
There's no sun in the morning.
Because of the fog.

883
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:47,280
You still have running water, right?

884
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:48,320
Of course.

885
01:16:48,910 --> 01:16:50,990
Take a foot bath before sleeping,

886
01:16:51,060 --> 01:16:53,950
and I'll prescribe
dopamine, so take that.

887
01:16:54,030 --> 01:16:55,740
If that still doesn't work,

888
01:16:58,780 --> 01:17:02,650
this instrument helps you breathe
through your nose as you sleep.

889
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:06,110
This here...

890
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:11,150
You know pomegranates
can delay menopause?

891
01:17:13,570 --> 01:17:15,780
Won't things be easier
for you after menopause?

892
01:17:16,070 --> 01:17:18,740
That's true, but still...

893
01:17:19,200 --> 01:17:20,730
Since you moved home,

894
01:17:20,810 --> 01:17:22,150
I feel healthier

895
01:17:22,230 --> 01:17:23,010
thanks to your cooking

896
01:17:23,090 --> 01:17:24,860
and these pomegranates.

897
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:27,200
So why are you withering away?

898
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:28,450
Withering?

899
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:30,360
Am I a pomegranate?

900
01:17:30,610 --> 01:17:33,450
June was shocked to see your photo.

901
01:17:33,530 --> 01:17:36,070
Said, "What happened to
your good-looking husband?"

902
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:40,030
I heard 56 percent of middle-aged
men are at risk of depression.

903
01:17:40,310 --> 01:17:42,320
June knows a guy who
took soft-shell turtle juice,

904
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:43,650
and it really helped

905
01:17:43,730 --> 01:17:45,490
with testosterone.

906
01:18:06,030 --> 01:18:09,770
I'm really happy with
you here in Ipo...

907
01:18:10,310 --> 01:18:12,070
I'm happy, too.

908
01:18:13,730 --> 01:18:17,360
You need murder and violence
in order to be happy.

909
01:18:27,150 --> 01:18:28,910
Where is your husband?

910
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:31,690
He ran off without me!

911
01:18:33,530 --> 01:18:34,490
You crazy jerk!

912
01:18:38,490 --> 01:18:40,440
Then what are all these?

913
01:18:41,730 --> 01:18:42,780
How could you buy this stuff

914
01:18:42,860 --> 01:18:45,070
without your husband?

915
01:18:45,780 --> 01:18:48,910
While you two live like this,

916
01:18:49,150 --> 01:18:51,320
my mom cries every day,

917
01:18:51,640 --> 01:18:54,320
begging me to kill her.

918
01:18:57,740 --> 01:18:59,060
What does the doctor say?

919
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:02,270
That she won't last a month.

920
01:19:04,900 --> 01:19:06,650
If my mom dies,

921
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:09,060
your damned husband...

922
01:19:18,810 --> 01:19:22,270
I told you I'd bear it
for just ten minutes.

923
01:19:22,900 --> 01:19:24,150
For your mother's sake.

924
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:27,740
Does she know you go
around beating up women?

925
01:19:29,150 --> 01:19:31,820
Does she know what your nickname is?

926
01:19:35,780 --> 01:19:37,240
If she dies,

927
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:40,610
I'll put her in the freezer

928
01:19:41,690 --> 01:19:43,280
and hold the funeral

929
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:45,530
until after I kill your husband!

930
01:19:50,860 --> 01:19:53,400
Those babies meant so much to me...

931
01:19:53,480 --> 01:19:54,990
Don't you worry now.

932
01:19:55,070 --> 01:19:58,190
Our captain here was the
nation's youngest inspector,

933
01:19:58,270 --> 01:20:00,310
an ace even in Busan!

934
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:05,110
Sir! The stolen goods
are 58 soft-shell turtles.

935
01:20:05,610 --> 01:20:07,370
What's the tally on damages?

936
01:20:07,450 --> 01:20:09,200
The market price is over 3,000 dollars!

937
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:11,950
What? Why so expensive?

938
01:20:12,450 --> 01:20:15,250
They help with depression
in middle-aged men.

939
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,910
You're a legend, Inspector!

940
01:20:18,240 --> 01:20:20,240
How could you know all that?

941
01:20:20,660 --> 01:20:22,830
- Tell them to turn off the lamps.
- Yes, sir.

942
01:20:24,040 --> 01:20:24,950
Hey, Ji-hyuk!

943
01:20:27,570 --> 01:20:29,490
<i>You're a fool!</i>

944
01:20:29,740 --> 01:20:35,200
<i>I told you not to come,
that you'd die here!</i>

945
01:20:38,280 --> 01:20:40,950
<i>What else can I do?</i>

946
01:20:41,030 --> 01:20:43,700
<i>- This is the sole way to see you.</i>
- This is the sole way to see you.

947
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:51,950
<i>Honey, pack your bags quick!</i>

948
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:53,370
Changed your number again?

949
01:20:53,450 --> 01:20:54,910
<i>Hurry up!</i>

950
01:20:54,990 --> 01:20:57,070
<i>Slappy found out your location!</i>

951
01:20:57,320 --> 01:21:00,040
<i>Oh, and next week, meet
with the Chinese clients.</i>

952
01:21:00,120 --> 01:21:01,540
<i>If I don't break through
on the Chinese front,</i>

953
01:21:01,620 --> 01:21:03,370
<i>I'm in trouble.</i>

954
01:21:03,450 --> 01:21:05,330
<i>Wait, I got a message.</i>

955
01:21:06,290 --> 01:21:08,950
<i>He came already?</i>

956
01:21:09,030 --> 01:21:11,740
<i>That's no face to be having
meetings with anyone.</i>

957
01:21:12,740 --> 01:21:15,790
<i>I love you. We're okay, right?</i>

958
01:21:15,870 --> 01:21:19,490
Whatever, let's move.

959
01:21:19,570 --> 01:21:23,330
<i>Yes, we'd better.
Since Slappy found you.</i>

960
01:21:23,620 --> 01:21:25,410
<i>Where should we move to?</i>

961
01:21:46,530 --> 01:21:49,120
- That's smoke, right?
- Smoke or fog.

962
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:52,040
Even if there's a real fire,
nobody will come out.

963
01:21:52,120 --> 01:21:54,200
Now that we're outside, let's smoke.

964
01:22:06,700 --> 01:22:09,620
People say you came here
after getting depression

965
01:22:09,700 --> 01:22:11,660
because you couldn't
stop a suspect's suicide.

966
01:22:13,620 --> 01:22:15,440
But I heard you recovered...

967
01:22:17,150 --> 01:22:18,860
Do I still look depressed?

968
01:22:21,740 --> 01:22:24,290
It's because I can't sleep. That's all.

969
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:26,950
He's wearing dress shoes?

970
01:22:27,820 --> 01:22:30,490
If you're not smoking,
why not go back in?

971
01:22:30,570 --> 01:22:32,700
For my sake, since I'm an outcast?

972
01:22:35,820 --> 01:22:37,860
At least the boonies are quiet, right?

973
01:22:39,740 --> 01:22:42,580
Smoke outside, will you?

974
01:22:47,990 --> 01:22:48,910
I love you!

975
01:23:21,410 --> 01:23:23,410
- What are you...
- I moved here.

976
01:23:23,490 --> 01:23:24,490
Why?

977
01:23:27,740 --> 01:23:29,370
There's nothing in this town.

978
01:23:29,660 --> 01:23:32,130
I like the mist.

979
01:23:32,670 --> 01:23:34,160
I'm Song Seo-rae.

980
01:23:34,750 --> 01:23:37,540
I'm Chinese, so my
Korean is insufficient.

981
01:23:40,840 --> 01:23:43,290
Honey, this is the detective

982
01:23:43,370 --> 01:23:45,080
who suspected me.

983
01:23:46,710 --> 01:23:50,840
I'm the next husband. Name's Im Ho-sin.

984
01:23:53,170 --> 01:23:54,620
Jang Hae-joon.

985
01:23:55,370 --> 01:23:56,870
What brings you to Ipo?

986
01:24:06,120 --> 01:24:08,370
I touched a fish.

987
01:24:11,960 --> 01:24:13,950
What brings you to Ipo?

988
01:24:14,620 --> 01:24:15,910
I moved here, too.

989
01:24:15,990 --> 01:24:17,870
My wife works here.

990
01:24:22,500 --> 01:24:24,250
I'm Ahn Jeong-ahn.

991
01:24:24,580 --> 01:24:27,290
People leave Ipo because of the fog.

992
01:24:27,370 --> 01:24:29,960
They don't come for it.

993
01:24:30,040 --> 01:24:32,950
Once you deal with the mold...

994
01:24:36,250 --> 01:24:37,920
Listen to you.

995
01:24:43,330 --> 01:24:46,420
Actually, we came
because of the reactor.

996
01:24:46,500 --> 01:24:48,460
Really? Why?

997
01:24:48,540 --> 01:24:50,670
- Is it "Red Alert"?
- Yes.

998
01:24:51,090 --> 01:24:54,370
You know the TV series
about the nuclear accident?

999
01:24:54,450 --> 01:24:55,960
So many Chinese women are dying

1000
01:24:56,040 --> 01:24:58,620
to visit the shooting location.

1001
01:24:58,870 --> 01:25:01,290
And she's a tour guide there.

1002
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:04,080
I realize it's your source of income,

1003
01:25:04,160 --> 01:25:06,670
so this may be a bit rude,

1004
01:25:06,750 --> 01:25:09,880
but we're not too keen on TV shows

1005
01:25:09,960 --> 01:25:11,670
that trade in such
baseless fearmongering.

1006
01:25:12,830 --> 01:25:14,790
That's where she works.

1007
01:25:14,870 --> 01:25:16,410
It's a sensitive topic.

1008
01:25:17,870 --> 01:25:21,040
Nuclear power plants are
actually completely safe.

1009
01:25:29,460 --> 01:25:31,460
You were on "Stock
Market TV," weren't you?

1010
01:25:31,540 --> 01:25:35,250
You've seen it! I'm a stock analyst.

1011
01:25:35,500 --> 01:25:38,250
Not an "analist" who likes rear ends.

1012
01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:50,750
You look younger than on TV.

1013
01:25:53,410 --> 01:25:56,290
The secret to my youth is a daily swim,

1014
01:25:56,370 --> 01:25:57,660
and for my secret to investing,

1015
01:25:58,010 --> 01:26:00,330
you can call me.

1016
01:26:00,630 --> 01:26:02,120
Can I have your card?

1017
01:26:23,160 --> 01:26:25,160
No need to run in this town.

1018
01:26:44,160 --> 01:26:46,410
She's pretty, that woman.

1019
01:26:47,160 --> 01:26:50,420
Her green dress was pretty.

1020
01:26:50,780 --> 01:26:52,660
Wasn't it blue?

1021
01:26:52,990 --> 01:26:54,290
Whatever.

1022
01:26:55,460 --> 01:26:59,050
A Chinese woman whose husband died...

1023
01:26:59,300 --> 01:27:01,540
Did you tell me about that case?

1024
01:27:04,130 --> 01:27:05,610
I heard about an old man

1025
01:27:05,690 --> 01:27:09,260
whose Chinese wife killed herself.

1026
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:12,750
There was that, too.

1027
01:27:13,300 --> 01:27:15,670
Did the husband murder her?

1028
01:27:16,010 --> 01:27:19,550
No, I suspected an innocent person.

1029
01:27:19,930 --> 01:27:21,840
That woman said you suspected her, too.

1030
01:27:22,670 --> 01:27:26,220
Yes, but her husband committed suicide.

1031
01:27:26,920 --> 01:27:29,880
You suspect a lot of
innocent people, honey.

1032
01:27:29,960 --> 01:27:32,460
That's why people hate us.

1033
01:27:34,050 --> 01:27:35,130
Us?

1034
01:27:36,920 --> 01:27:38,220
The police.

1035
01:27:59,580 --> 01:28:01,630
<i>ASSISTANT INSPECTOR YEO YEON-SOO</i>

1036
01:28:01,710 --> 01:28:04,420
Honey! Can you answer this?

1037
01:28:07,090 --> 01:28:08,340
Blood.

1038
01:28:10,170 --> 01:28:11,210
Hello?

1039
01:28:15,010 --> 01:28:16,170
Honey.

1040
01:28:17,510 --> 01:28:18,680
Congratulations.

1041
01:28:19,500 --> 01:28:20,540
What?

1042
01:28:21,210 --> 01:28:23,210
It's a murder case.

1043
01:28:28,920 --> 01:28:31,170
Estimated time of death, 11 a.m.

1044
01:28:31,250 --> 01:28:33,420
Stabbed 17 times.

1045
01:28:35,170 --> 01:28:38,050
Thirteen times in the
stomach and chest.

1046
01:28:38,130 --> 01:28:39,630
Four times in the back.

1047
01:28:39,710 --> 01:28:42,420
The wounds in the back were
while running away, I guess?

1048
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:46,090
Can a person run after
being stabbed 13 times?

1049
01:28:46,630 --> 01:28:50,500
And anyway, why is the
corpse in that position?

1050
01:28:50,920 --> 01:28:52,840
The wife was the first to find him.

1051
01:28:52,920 --> 01:28:55,090
Shall I bring her?

1052
01:29:34,550 --> 01:29:36,670
The suspect is left-handed.

1053
01:29:40,040 --> 01:29:41,250
Write this down!

1054
01:30:01,630 --> 01:30:03,260
Is this why you came to Ipo?

1055
01:30:03,340 --> 01:30:04,880
Am I such a pushover?

1056
01:30:07,920 --> 01:30:10,330
Am I so wicked?

1057
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:24,470
Listen to me, Ms. Song.

1058
01:30:25,560 --> 01:30:26,920
This time, your alibi

1059
01:30:28,240 --> 01:30:30,510
better be solid as a rock.

1060
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:37,360
You think the wife killed him?

1061
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:38,430
Why?

1062
01:30:38,760 --> 01:30:40,340
Because there are no signs

1063
01:30:40,420 --> 01:30:42,060
of forced entry or theft?

1064
01:30:42,430 --> 01:30:44,690
Because he was stabbed
haphazardly from the front,

1065
01:30:44,770 --> 01:30:47,840
suggesting a crime of passion
by an acquaintance?

1066
01:30:48,300 --> 01:30:50,970
Because the wife didn't
seem very shocked or sad?

1067
01:30:51,720 --> 01:30:55,140
That's because there are some
to whom grief comes crashing...

1068
01:30:56,020 --> 01:30:58,220
Why are you so inquisitive with me

1069
01:30:58,300 --> 01:31:00,390
and not with the others?

1070
01:31:04,640 --> 01:31:07,550
I know her from another
case, last year in Busan.

1071
01:31:08,260 --> 01:31:10,180
Her husband died then, too.

1072
01:31:10,260 --> 01:31:11,930
She killed him?

1073
01:31:13,640 --> 01:31:15,680
Sorry, the question just popped

1074
01:31:15,760 --> 01:31:17,550
into my head.

1075
01:31:17,630 --> 01:31:19,390
It was ruled a suicide,

1076
01:31:19,470 --> 01:31:21,020
but now, another husband died,

1077
01:31:21,100 --> 01:31:22,390
in my jurisdiction again!

1078
01:31:22,810 --> 01:31:24,060
But she's right-handed.

1079
01:31:25,220 --> 01:31:26,650
So we need to figure out

1080
01:31:26,730 --> 01:31:28,720
how she can be the murderer!

1081
01:31:33,890 --> 01:31:35,530
They said come to the station.

1082
01:31:36,190 --> 01:31:38,260
Can I get my handbag?

1083
01:31:41,100 --> 01:31:43,640
You went out for a walk,

1084
01:31:43,890 --> 01:31:46,390
but you left your phone
behind, so it can't be traced.

1085
01:31:46,470 --> 01:31:48,760
No way to prove your alibi, then?

1086
01:31:48,840 --> 01:31:50,600
It seems so.

1087
01:31:51,970 --> 01:31:53,640
You don't seem worried at all.

1088
01:31:55,380 --> 01:31:58,050
Did anyone hold a grudge
against your husband?

1089
01:31:59,130 --> 01:32:02,180
He did a lot of investing
with other people's money.

1090
01:32:02,260 --> 01:32:05,260
Recently, there were losses.

1091
01:32:05,340 --> 01:32:08,220
But he lived in a luxury villa.

1092
01:32:08,590 --> 01:32:11,640
He said to raise money, you
have to spend it visibly.

1093
01:32:15,090 --> 01:32:17,470
Why did you marry a man like that?

1094
01:32:19,930 --> 01:32:24,080
It was so I could make the decision

1095
01:32:25,490 --> 01:32:26,720
to leave another man.

1096
01:32:33,260 --> 01:32:36,090
Did you come to Ipo because
of any connections here?

1097
01:32:37,090 --> 01:32:39,760
Because we have no connections here.

1098
01:32:40,010 --> 01:32:43,600
If we did, creditors would find us.

1099
01:32:54,340 --> 01:32:57,300
You chose your husband
not for reasons of love.

1100
01:32:57,630 --> 01:33:00,640
That husband received various threats

1101
01:33:00,890 --> 01:33:02,560
and then died.

1102
01:33:02,890 --> 01:33:04,550
Just the same as last year.

1103
01:33:04,630 --> 01:33:05,800
What?

1104
01:33:07,010 --> 01:33:09,140
That husband was suicide,

1105
01:33:09,220 --> 01:33:11,470
and this husband was murder.

1106
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:16,220
Fine.

1107
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:20,240
In the same detective's jurisdiction,

1108
01:33:20,320 --> 01:33:22,590
but quite far apart from each other,

1109
01:33:25,050 --> 01:33:26,250
two husbands died

1110
01:33:26,270 --> 01:33:28,470
of suicide or murder.

1111
01:33:29,970 --> 01:33:31,650
If someone told me that,

1112
01:33:31,730 --> 01:33:33,960
I'd probably respond like this.

1113
01:33:35,220 --> 01:33:37,550
Wow, what a coincidence.

1114
01:33:38,890 --> 01:33:41,010
How would you respond?

1115
01:33:44,720 --> 01:33:46,310
Wow,

1116
01:33:47,940 --> 01:33:50,230
what a poor woman.

1117
01:34:36,100 --> 01:34:37,380
She had different clothes.

1118
01:34:37,460 --> 01:34:38,900
It was a blue dress.

1119
01:34:38,980 --> 01:34:40,310
With no coat.

1120
01:34:40,690 --> 01:34:41,820
You sure it was blue?

1121
01:34:42,310 --> 01:34:43,600
Not green?

1122
01:34:43,890 --> 01:34:45,390
Thank you.

1123
01:34:49,560 --> 01:34:51,440
It's blue all right.

1124
01:34:51,900 --> 01:34:53,770
What was she doing down there?

1125
01:35:05,310 --> 01:35:08,690
Why did you move here, really?

1126
01:35:10,310 --> 01:35:12,260
Why do you keep asking?

1127
01:35:12,720 --> 01:35:13,990
Is it so important to you

1128
01:35:14,070 --> 01:35:16,270
why I came?

1129
01:35:21,400 --> 01:35:23,350
Why is it important?

1130
01:35:27,680 --> 01:35:29,980
What else can I do?

1131
01:35:30,060 --> 01:35:31,360
This is the sole way to see you.

1132
01:35:39,560 --> 01:35:41,760
What did you wear on
your walk by the sea?

1133
01:35:43,930 --> 01:35:44,930
This.

1134
01:35:45,480 --> 01:35:46,600
That's a lie.

1135
01:35:47,390 --> 01:35:49,060
Where's the blue-green dress?

1136
01:35:49,310 --> 01:35:50,030
That looks blue one moment

1137
01:35:50,110 --> 01:35:51,660
and green the next?

1138
01:35:52,060 --> 01:35:53,770
With the sparkling buttons.

1139
01:35:54,020 --> 01:35:55,850
You looked so closely.

1140
01:35:59,600 --> 01:36:01,720
Where can it be?

1141
01:36:07,560 --> 01:36:09,520
Sorry I'm late!

1142
01:36:10,310 --> 01:36:11,430
Hello.

1143
01:36:13,260 --> 01:36:14,600
Did you see this?

1144
01:36:15,430 --> 01:36:18,560
Wow, a murder in our town!

1145
01:36:21,220 --> 01:36:23,980
I'm sleepy already. How
will I stay up all night?

<i>FAMOUS STOCK ANALYST FOUND DEAD IN IPO</i>

<i>I came back from my walk,</i>

01:37:48,490 --> 01:37:49,760

01:37:55,860 --> 01:37:57,240
under emergency arrest for murder.

1157
01:38:01,150 --> 01:38:05,150
I didn't want the police to
step on my husband's blood.

1158
01:38:07,110 --> 01:38:09,400
We've got her smartwatch, right?

1159
01:38:09,770 --> 01:38:11,190
Open up the voice recordings.

1160
01:38:11,650 --> 01:38:14,780
They must be in Chinese,
so find a translator.

1161
01:38:18,410 --> 01:38:20,570
Are you a male?

1162
01:38:20,650 --> 01:38:21,690
No.

1163
01:38:22,860 --> 01:38:25,070
Have you ever killed a person?

1164
01:38:26,190 --> 01:38:27,150
Yes.

1165
01:38:28,900 --> 01:38:32,570
Did you kill your husband Im Ho-sin?

1166
01:38:38,730 --> 01:38:40,440
No.

1167
01:39:03,610 --> 01:39:05,070
Inspector?

1168
01:39:07,690 --> 01:39:09,310
What are you doing here?

1169
01:39:22,360 --> 01:39:24,530
The transcript of the
smartwatch recordings.

1170
01:39:24,610 --> 01:39:27,810
And you asked us to check
the plates of cars near the villa

1171
01:39:27,890 --> 01:39:29,860
in recent days.

1172
01:39:30,110 --> 01:39:33,070
One of them was a man
defrauded by Im Ho-sin.

1173
01:39:33,320 --> 01:39:35,570
<i>And he's been arrested
twice for assault.</i>

1174
01:39:35,650 --> 01:39:37,940
<i>His name is Sa Cheol-seong.</i>

1175
01:39:38,020 --> 01:39:39,770
<i>I've never heard of that last time.</i>

1176
01:39:45,820 --> 01:39:47,190
Let go!

1177
01:39:50,480 --> 01:39:52,150
You okay? What are you doing?

1178
01:39:55,150 --> 01:39:56,810
Call me.

1179
01:39:59,060 --> 01:40:02,730
Call me, Mom!

1180
01:40:05,900 --> 01:40:07,850
Left-handed, right?

1181
01:40:09,560 --> 01:40:11,360
270,000 dollars.

1182
01:40:11,650 --> 01:40:13,300
That's what my mom earned

1183
01:40:13,380 --> 01:40:15,200
running a food cart for ten years

1184
01:40:15,280 --> 01:40:18,360
and then running her own Chinese
restaurant 18 hours a day.

1185
01:40:18,440 --> 01:40:20,530
She gave that money to Im Ho-sin.

1186
01:40:20,610 --> 01:40:22,780
At first, it was only 10,000 dollars.

1187
01:40:22,860 --> 01:40:24,220
But when dividends kept coming in,

1188
01:40:24,300 --> 01:40:25,610
she got excited

1189
01:40:25,690 --> 01:40:27,940
and threw it all in.

1190
01:40:28,230 --> 01:40:30,580
So that guy takes everyone's cash

1191
01:40:30,660 --> 01:40:32,830
and goes around staying in hotels,

1192
01:40:32,910 --> 01:40:34,230
gambling,

1193
01:40:34,310 --> 01:40:36,410
buying his wife clothes and handbags,

1194
01:40:36,490 --> 01:40:39,160
living like a king!

1195
01:40:39,820 --> 01:40:41,030
Ten million dollars.

1196
01:40:42,830 --> 01:40:45,000
My mom already had diabetes,

1197
01:40:45,370 --> 01:40:48,370
but after losing that
money, she collapsed,

1198
01:40:48,450 --> 01:40:50,620
and her kidneys gave out.

1199
01:40:50,990 --> 01:40:52,700
She couldn't get treated in time,

1200
01:40:52,780 --> 01:40:55,290
and they cut off all her toes!

1201
01:40:55,740 --> 01:40:58,490
You know why they call me Slappy?

1202
01:40:58,740 --> 01:41:00,550
Slap, slap...

1203
01:41:00,630 --> 01:41:02,370
my hand can really fly!

1204
01:41:02,450 --> 01:41:04,270
Slapping with my palm

1205
01:41:04,350 --> 01:41:05,820
hurts a lot less than punching,

1206
01:41:05,900 --> 01:41:07,490
so I can keep on hitting!

1207
01:41:08,530 --> 01:41:09,730
But...

1208
01:41:09,810 --> 01:41:11,750
if I don't kill Im Ho-sin,

1209
01:41:11,830 --> 01:41:13,210
can I call myself a man?

1210
01:41:13,290 --> 01:41:15,440
Do you know Song Seo-rae?

1211
01:41:15,740 --> 01:41:18,200
Did she ask you to kill him?

1212
01:41:18,660 --> 01:41:22,030
Give me a break.

1213
01:41:22,370 --> 01:41:25,610
I'm not a guy to take
orders from anyone else.

1214
01:41:25,690 --> 01:41:28,080
Song Seo-rae was a big help to me.

1215
01:41:28,160 --> 01:41:29,910
She must have no idea,

1216
01:41:29,990 --> 01:41:31,830
why it is that I found her

1217
01:41:31,910 --> 01:41:33,990
wherever she ran...

1218
01:41:38,490 --> 01:41:41,620
I took her phone

1219
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:45,740
and installed a tracking app.

1220
01:41:50,910 --> 01:41:53,620
What the hell?

1221
01:41:53,990 --> 01:41:57,530
Why did you sit him up? That's creepy.

1222
01:41:58,820 --> 01:42:00,490
You scumbag,

1223
01:42:00,570 --> 01:42:03,250
you want a slap in the face?

1224
01:42:03,330 --> 01:42:04,820
Have you lost your marbles?

1225
01:42:06,400 --> 01:42:07,780
I'll slap...

1226
01:42:12,200 --> 01:42:14,570
Sir, don't you feel happy?

1227
01:42:15,530 --> 01:42:16,650
Why should I?

1228
01:42:17,150 --> 01:42:20,700
We solved Ipo's first-ever murder case!

1229
01:42:20,780 --> 01:42:22,910
Where should we celebrate?

1230
01:42:23,280 --> 01:42:24,650
Solved?

1231
01:42:25,070 --> 01:42:26,740
Who said it's solved?

1232
01:42:26,820 --> 01:42:27,770
Now that we've got the suspect,

1233
01:42:27,850 --> 01:42:30,160
we can let Song Seo-rae go, right?

1234
01:42:30,490 --> 01:42:32,490
Just popped into my head.

1235
01:42:32,740 --> 01:42:34,530
<i>Suspects in the
soft-shell turtle burglary</i>

1236
01:42:34,610 --> 01:42:36,660
<i>fleeing on a motorcycle.</i>

1237
01:42:36,740 --> 01:42:39,530
<i>Approaching the community
center. Requesting backup.</i>

1238
01:42:53,410 --> 01:42:55,610
They're running away!

1239
01:42:56,450 --> 01:42:57,610
The turtles!

1240
01:43:01,200 --> 01:43:02,780
Hurry up!

1241
01:43:03,030 --> 01:43:05,190
Come here, you. Hold the sack!

1242
01:43:06,780 --> 01:43:08,410
Get the big ones first!

1243
01:43:08,490 --> 01:43:10,700
They've got a temper,
so watch your fingers!

1244
01:43:28,570 --> 01:43:30,660
I returned some stolen goods...

1245
01:43:34,190 --> 01:43:37,320
If the husband of a woman
my husband knows

1246
01:43:37,570 --> 01:43:41,240
calls me twice in the
middle of the night...

1247
01:43:43,480 --> 01:43:44,900
Did he call by mistake?

1248
01:43:46,440 --> 01:43:47,500
Is he hitting

1249
01:43:47,580 --> 01:43:49,700
on a married woman he just met?

1250
01:43:51,240 --> 01:43:54,120
I could just ignore it, but...

1251
01:43:54,200 --> 01:43:57,250
if he was killed not long after that?

1252
01:43:58,170 --> 01:43:59,370
Honey.

1253
01:44:06,660 --> 01:44:08,460
Did you kill him?

1254
01:44:16,580 --> 01:44:18,210
Did the two of you kill him?

1255
01:44:20,460 --> 01:44:22,490
Is your finger okay?

1256
01:44:23,620 --> 01:44:25,750
The number for Im
Ho-sin's burner phone.

1257
01:44:25,830 --> 01:44:28,120
Check the location on
the day he was killed.

1258
01:44:28,830 --> 01:44:30,670
<i>IM FOR "IMPACTFUL INVESTMENT"!
HO FOR "HOT TIPS"!</i>

1259
01:44:30,750 --> 01:44:33,620
<i>SIN FOR "SINGLE GREATEST ANALYST"!</i>

1260
01:44:34,870 --> 01:44:35,870
Inspector!

1261
01:44:36,410 --> 01:44:37,410
Yeah?

1262
01:44:42,910 --> 01:44:44,750
While Im Ho-sin was dead at home,

1263
01:44:44,830 --> 01:44:45,920
why was his phone being

1264
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,460
turned on and off here?

1265
01:44:49,330 --> 01:44:52,160
Raise your arm and
lift your hand a bit.

1266
01:44:52,740 --> 01:44:55,080
My arm hurts!

1267
01:44:58,620 --> 01:44:59,540
Stop!

1268
01:45:03,950 --> 01:45:05,460
She threw the phone.

1269
01:45:05,540 --> 01:45:07,540
Let's call the divers and search!

1270
01:45:07,830 --> 01:45:09,170
Is it deep there?

1271
01:45:09,420 --> 01:45:11,000
Will you snap out of it?

1272
01:45:11,240 --> 01:45:13,040
We caught the murderer!

1273
01:45:13,120 --> 01:45:15,040
We have evidence and a confession!

1274
01:45:15,450 --> 01:45:18,340
Will you please stop obsessing
about that woman?

1275
01:45:18,420 --> 01:45:20,540
Don't you feel sorry for her?

1276
01:45:38,620 --> 01:45:40,290
<i>He's wearing dress shoes?</i>

1277
01:45:40,780 --> 01:45:41,970
<i>Stubble?</i>

1278
01:45:42,050 --> 01:45:44,160
<i>He used to shave day and night.</i>

1279
01:45:44,540 --> 01:45:45,540
<i>Has he grown lazy?</i>

1280
01:45:46,370 --> 01:45:47,770
<i>He looks lifeless...</i>

1281
01:45:47,850 --> 01:45:50,950
<i>Because he can't meet me?</i>

1282
01:45:59,250 --> 01:46:02,080
<i>When he cooked that
bizarre Chinese food,</i>

1283
01:46:02,160 --> 01:46:03,870
<i>I smoked right next to him.</i>

1284
01:46:04,830 --> 01:46:06,460
<i>This man can't stand cigarettes.</i>

1285
01:46:07,080 --> 01:46:09,540
<i>Saying he loves me, empty words...</i>

1286
01:46:11,910 --> 01:46:13,410
<i>I remember the nights</i>

1287
01:46:13,490 --> 01:46:15,200
<i>he watched me.</i>

1288
01:46:17,120 --> 01:46:18,290
<i>It felt like</i>

1289
01:46:19,120 --> 01:46:20,990
<i>a trustworthy man</i>

1290
01:46:21,530 --> 01:46:24,040
<i>was staying awake to watch over me.</i>

1291
01:46:25,290 --> 01:46:27,170
<i>He's coming.</i>

1292
01:46:27,250 --> 01:46:28,420
<i>He'll ask me</i>

1293
01:46:28,500 --> 01:46:31,330
<i>is this why I came to Ipo.</i>

1294
01:46:31,410 --> 01:46:33,240
<i>What do I say?</i>

1295
01:46:35,040 --> 01:46:38,540
<i>Why do you keep crying, Song Seo-rae?</i>

1296
01:46:41,200 --> 01:46:42,280
<i>Should I answer him?</i>

1297
01:46:44,790 --> 01:46:45,700
<i>No...</i>

1298
01:46:47,710 --> 01:46:48,790
<i>He may</i>

1299
01:46:50,240 --> 01:46:51,580
<i>already know it.</i>

1300
01:46:53,160 --> 01:46:55,660
<i>He may not even ask.</i>

1301
01:46:59,780 --> 01:47:01,490
Is this why you came to Ipo?

1302
01:47:11,080 --> 01:47:12,370
<i>Hello.</i>

1303
01:47:12,870 --> 01:47:15,590
What was on that phone? Answer me.

1304
01:47:17,840 --> 01:47:19,330
Open the door now!

1305
01:47:20,250 --> 01:47:21,880
<i>I'm not there.</i>

1306
01:47:21,960 --> 01:47:23,130
Then where are you?

1307
01:47:23,840 --> 01:47:25,260
<i>Homi Mountain.</i>

1308
01:47:25,920 --> 01:47:27,240
<i>What was on Im Ho-sin's phone</i>

1309
01:47:27,330 --> 01:47:29,120
<i>that you had to throw it away?</i>

1310
01:47:29,540 --> 01:47:31,090
<i>Don't fall asleep.</i>

1311
01:47:31,380 --> 01:47:33,220
<i>Just a little bit farther.</i>

1312
01:47:33,300 --> 01:47:35,760
<i>There's no mist here.</i>

1313
01:47:37,260 --> 01:47:39,750
<i>Why did Im Ho-sin call my wife?</i>

1314
01:47:42,800 --> 01:47:47,050
<i>My mountain-loving mom often told me,</i>

1315
01:47:47,130 --> 01:47:49,670
<i>each time I felt upset...</i>

1316
01:47:51,340 --> 01:47:54,840
<i>if I go to Korea, my mountain is there.</i>

1317
01:47:58,420 --> 01:47:59,750
<i>Be honest with me.</i>

1318
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,310
<i>You knew that</i>

1319
01:48:02,390 --> 01:48:04,170
<i>Im Ho-sin wanted to
talk to my wife right?</i>

1320
01:48:04,710 --> 01:48:08,010
<i>In court, the government
took it from me,</i>

1321
01:48:08,090 --> 01:48:10,300
<i>but whatever anyone says,</i>

1322
01:48:10,380 --> 01:48:13,210
<i>in my heart, this is my mountain.</i>

1323
01:48:26,300 --> 01:48:29,040
Mom, Grandpa.

1324
01:48:30,750 --> 01:48:33,130
I brought a very trustworthy man.

1325
01:48:47,050 --> 01:48:48,500
Scatter these for me.

1326
01:48:49,670 --> 01:48:51,880
You know I'm scared of heights.

1327
01:49:00,460 --> 01:49:03,800
Why do I marry such men?

1328
01:49:05,590 --> 01:49:07,770
Because commendable men like you

1329
01:49:07,950 --> 01:49:10,670
won't marry me.

1330
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:12,880
For such a man to speak to me,

1331
01:49:12,960 --> 01:49:15,300
something on the scale
of murder has to happen.

1332
01:49:15,380 --> 01:49:17,250
Is this a time for jokes?

1333
01:49:30,130 --> 01:49:31,030
<i>After leaving me,</i>

1334
01:49:31,110 --> 01:49:34,050
<i>you never once slept soundly, right?</i>

1335
01:49:34,130 --> 01:49:35,550
<i>Even if you forced your eyes shut,</i>

1336
01:49:35,630 --> 01:49:37,870
<i>you kept thinking of me?</i>

1337
01:49:42,800 --> 01:49:45,300
<i>Didn't you feel this way, too?</i>

1338
01:49:52,670 --> 01:49:55,180
<i>That night you ran
into me in the market,</i>

1339
01:49:55,260 --> 01:49:58,210
<i>suddenly, you felt alive again?</i>

1340
01:49:59,540 --> 01:50:01,290
At last.

1341
01:50:06,660 --> 01:50:10,040
My hands are soft enough now?

1342
01:50:23,670 --> 01:50:26,250
For the past 402 days, I've...

1343
01:50:30,170 --> 01:50:31,960
You were...

1344
01:50:40,220 --> 01:50:41,720
But that doesn't change the fact

1345
01:50:41,800 --> 01:50:44,470
that I'm a cop and you're a suspect.

1346
01:50:47,760 --> 01:50:49,340
You know the word "suspect"?

1347
01:50:49,800 --> 01:50:51,800
Someone the police are watching.

1348
01:50:53,680 --> 01:50:55,510
I like that.

1349
01:50:57,720 --> 01:50:59,200
Treat me as you will,

1350
01:50:59,280 --> 01:51:01,640
like you always did...

1351
01:51:02,640 --> 01:51:04,270
As a suspect.

1352
01:51:08,260 --> 01:51:09,290
You're curious

1353
01:51:09,370 --> 01:51:10,890
why I like you, right?

1354
01:51:11,850 --> 01:51:13,560
Or did you say you weren't?

1355
01:51:16,170 --> 01:51:17,420
Seo-rae,

1356
01:51:20,640 --> 01:51:21,930
your body is very...

1357
01:51:23,930 --> 01:51:25,300
upright.

1358
01:51:26,720 --> 01:51:27,670
Few people have such posture

1359
01:51:27,750 --> 01:51:29,680
unless they're nervous.

1360
01:51:33,390 --> 01:51:36,550
I think it says a lot about you.

1361
01:51:55,420 --> 01:51:57,880
What happened to
the four fentanyl pills?

1362
01:52:17,430 --> 01:52:19,760
Carrying you all this time

1363
01:52:20,370 --> 01:52:22,560
has been heavy for me.

1364
01:52:26,090 --> 01:52:28,260
Goodbye, Grandpa.

1365
01:52:43,500 --> 01:52:47,050
Goodbye, Mom.

1366
01:53:16,550 --> 01:53:17,500
I told you to throw this

1367
01:53:17,580 --> 01:53:19,340
where no one can find it!

1368
01:53:23,050 --> 01:53:26,050
Re-investigate with this.

1369
01:53:26,130 --> 01:53:29,380
Go back to before you were shattered.

1370
01:53:53,380 --> 01:53:57,850
Maybe I went to Ipo

1371
01:53:57,930 --> 01:53:59,720
to become one of your unresolved cases.

1372
01:55:20,850 --> 01:55:23,140
- June!
- Yes?

1373
01:55:25,140 --> 01:55:26,590
Your first time seeing him?

1374
01:55:26,670 --> 01:55:28,940
June just got divorced.

1375
01:55:29,310 --> 01:55:32,260
I'm Lee June. I've
heard a lot about you.

1376
01:55:44,270 --> 01:55:46,020
It didn't snow here?

1377
01:55:46,390 --> 01:55:47,350
What?

1378
01:55:57,810 --> 01:55:59,650
What about that promise of ours?

1379
01:56:00,510 --> 01:56:01,430
What promise?

1380
01:56:01,550 --> 01:56:03,270
That we'd do it once a week

1381
01:56:03,350 --> 01:56:04,680
even when we hate each other.

1382
01:56:06,810 --> 01:56:08,440
Step aside, would you?

1383
01:56:20,800 --> 01:56:22,890
<i>Are you getting enough sleep?</i>

1384
01:56:23,930 --> 01:56:25,850
They did a test

1385
01:56:25,930 --> 01:56:28,560
and said I wake up 47 times per hour.

1386
01:56:30,090 --> 01:56:31,470
Can you believe that?

1387
01:56:34,310 --> 01:56:36,410
I'd like to exchange my sleep with you,

1388
01:56:36,490 --> 01:56:37,940
like batteries.

1389
01:56:41,260 --> 01:56:42,890
They say it's because I
breathe through my mouth.

1390
01:56:47,100 --> 01:56:50,350
They said to use a machine
to breathe through my nose.

1391
01:56:50,430 --> 01:56:52,180
There's a machine like that.

1392
01:56:54,810 --> 01:56:55,960
It's strange.

1393
01:56:56,040 --> 01:56:57,850
I breathe through my nose when awake.

1394
01:57:12,850 --> 01:57:15,220
That doesn't mean I snore, though.

1395
01:57:19,720 --> 01:57:21,140
I know.

1396
01:57:31,480 --> 01:57:34,400
Sunbathing... Vitamin D!

1397
01:57:35,490 --> 01:57:37,020
Good to see the sun, huh?

1398
01:57:37,400 --> 01:57:39,060
Thirty minutes are up.

1399
01:57:44,320 --> 01:57:46,820
I talked to the women
divers by the sea.

1400
01:57:46,900 --> 01:57:48,880
Told them to keep an eye out

1401
01:57:48,960 --> 01:57:50,550
while diving for abalone.

1402
01:57:51,150 --> 01:57:56,030
Think this can be restored?

On the day your mother died,

1425
01:59:14,930 --> 01:59:16,560
you met Song Seo-rae?

1426
01:59:17,560 --> 01:59:20,690
She visited the hospital
early in the morning.

1427
01:59:23,400 --> 01:59:25,210
<i>She said she felt so bad</i>

1428

<i>about my mom's condition</i>

<i>as a fellow Chinese.</i>

1430
01:59:31,980 --> 01:59:34,480
Did she bring any pills?

1431
01:59:35,110 --> 01:59:37,100
Something for her diabetes?

1432
01:59:38,060 --> 01:59:39,690
Blue-green capsules.

1433
01:59:40,100 --> 01:59:41,280
I don't know,

1434
01:59:41,560 --> 01:59:44,980
but she sure knew
how to treat a patient.

1435
01:59:45,360 --> 01:59:46,810
She massaged her here and there,

1436
01:59:46,890 --> 01:59:49,190
and my mom cheered right up.

1437
01:59:49,270 --> 01:59:51,810
So I left and went out for breakfast.

1438
01:59:52,610 --> 01:59:53,460
When I got back,

1439
01:59:53,540 --> 01:59:54,940
she was gone,

1440
01:59:55,570 --> 01:59:58,730
and my mom was lying back
comfortably with her eyes closed,

1441
01:59:58,810 --> 02:00:02,480
talking about how she felt so sleepy.

1442
02:00:03,570 --> 02:00:05,850
Then not long after...

1443
02:00:08,560 --> 02:00:10,530
Did her massage have anything

1444
02:00:10,610 --> 02:00:13,900
to do with my mom's passing?

1445
02:00:16,770 --> 02:00:18,260
Didn't Slappy say

1446
02:00:18,340 --> 02:00:21,020
he put a tracking app
on Seo-rae's phone?

1447
02:00:31,520 --> 02:00:32,820

1448
02:00:33,110 --> 02:00:35,140
<i>We restored your husband's phone.</i>

1449

<i>But there's no voice file.</i>

1450
02:00:38,310 --> 02:00:40,360
<i>It was Slappy who killed your husband,</i>

1451
02:00:40,610 --> 02:00:43,110
<i>but you killed Slappy's mother.</i>

1452
02:00:43,730 --> 02:00:45,070

1453
02:00:45,150 --> 02:00:47,640
<i>he'd kill your husband
if his mother died.</i>

1454
02:00:49,450 --> 02:00:50,990
<i>Your husband</i>

1455
02:00:51,280 --> 02:00:53,620
and Slappy's mother...

1456
02:00:56,650 --> 02:00:58,700
They both died because of me, right?

1457
02:01:03,990 --> 02:01:06,450
She'd have died soon anyway.

1458
02:01:06,530 --> 02:01:09,320
Why give her the fentanyl?

1459
02:01:10,160 --> 02:01:12,700
She thanked me for it.

1460
02:01:20,200 --> 02:01:23,370
What was the recording your
husband threatened to share?

1461

<i>Don't worry about that.</i>

<i>You've got the original?</i>

1464

What's the recording?

1465
02:01:33,870 --> 02:01:35,570
Your voice.

1466
02:01:35,990 --> 02:01:37,280
<i>What?</i>

1467
02:01:38,820 --> 02:01:42,200
Telling me you love me.

1468
02:01:46,320 --> 02:01:47,610
Me?

1469
02:01:49,740 --> 02:01:52,580
I liked it so much. I listened often.

1470
02:01:54,780 --> 02:01:57,070
<i>But my husband found out.</i>

1471
02:01:59,780 --> 02:02:01,780
<i>When did I say I loved you?</i>

1472
02:02:04,780 --> 02:02:06,030
<i>When was it?</i>

1473
02:02:22,280 --> 02:02:24,400
The moment you said you loved me,

1474
02:02:24,780 --> 02:02:26,030
your love ended.

1475
02:02:30,700 --> 02:02:33,020
And the moment your love ended,

1476
02:02:33,820 --> 02:02:35,440
my love began.

1477
02:02:36,610 --> 02:02:38,110
