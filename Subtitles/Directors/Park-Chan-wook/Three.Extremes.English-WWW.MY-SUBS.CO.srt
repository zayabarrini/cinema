1
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:35,992
The dream...

2
00:01:37,397 --> 00:01:43,129
always ends there.

3
00:02:15,668 --> 00:02:16,368
BOX

4
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:13,983
You still don't trust me, do you?

5
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:29,974
The box is too small...
I can't breathe.

6
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:14,239
I finished it.

7
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,515
Thank you very much

8
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:22,754
I'll go to the office and read it over.

9
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:41,272
Your handwriting is almost
as neat as typing.

10
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:47,946
I don't mean it should be typed, either.

11
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:54,716
I have to write by hand.

12
00:05:58,758 --> 00:06:02,350
I can't type...

13
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:08,533
You're left-handed, aren't you?

14
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:16,208
I've read so many manuscripts

15
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:19,100
I can tell

16
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:33,086
I'll be in touch then...

17
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:53,140
One thing...

18
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:57,543
I mean...

19
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,754
Your novels are doing very well.

20
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:06,886
Here, a small token.

21
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:35,864
Sis'?

22
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:42,700
Sister, dear?

23
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:50,214
It's you, isn't it?

24
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,076
It's me.

25
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,784
Kyoko...

26
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:04,452
Say something.

27
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:10,799
Sister!

28
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:45,294
It's hot... I'm burning...

29
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:55,102
It wasn't what you think!

30
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:57,549
It really wasn't!

31
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:58,848
It wasn't!

32
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:29,193
Shoko...

33
00:14:30,736 --> 00:14:34,772
you did well today.

34
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,041
A little reward.

35
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:48,415
Keep up the good work.

36
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:01,533
Kyoko, keep trying!

37
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:03,765
You'll be rewarded too.

38
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:37,346
Sensei.

39
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:49,166
I was looking...

40
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:52,036
looking for someone.

41
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:56,272
Someone?

42
00:18:01,146 --> 00:18:02,838
Who is it?

43
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:13,716
Can't I be him?

44
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:18,730
At least...

45
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:23,693
I'm here for you.

46
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:33,776
You do look like him.

47
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:48,852
Bear it for one night.

48
00:19:50,822 --> 00:19:53,725
I want to be you...

49
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:56,651
to sleep like you

50
00:19:56,995 --> 00:20:01,862
to have nice dreams.

51
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:09,002
What's going on?

52
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:26,623
Shoko, don't worry.

53
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,796
Shoko...

54
00:27:00,685 --> 00:27:02,582
Sister...

55
00:27:04,689 --> 00:27:06,279
I'm sorry.

56
00:27:11,997 --> 00:27:15,498
I didn't do it out of hatred.

57
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:22,205
It wasn't the necklace, either.

58
00:27:25,877 --> 00:27:29,140
I loved you so much, sis'

59
00:27:37,722 --> 00:27:42,282
I looked for you everywhere.

60
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:47,164
It's true.

61
00:27:49,968 --> 00:27:53,560
I loved you more than anyone in the world.

62
00:27:57,075 --> 00:27:59,040
More than anyone.

63
00:28:23,968 --> 00:28:25,592
Help me...

64
00:30:32,564 --> 00:30:33,995
So beautiful.

65
00:31:03,494 --> 00:31:06,062
I can't decide...

66
00:31:07,765 --> 00:31:10,595
which one of you is more beautiful...

67
00:31:14,772 --> 00:31:19,571
Shoko back then or you right now?

68
00:31:30,355 --> 00:31:32,218
Oh, Kyoko...

69
00:31:35,526 --> 00:31:37,561
Why did you do it?

70
00:31:37,862 --> 00:31:39,122
Don't...

71
00:31:44,836 --> 00:31:50,033
You thought I only loved your sister?

72
00:32:01,686 --> 00:32:03,686
Poor thing...

73
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:09,727
The heat was unbearable...

74
00:32:10,028 --> 00:32:11,186
Don't!

75
00:32:13,331 --> 00:32:16,093
She couldn't get out...

76
00:32:21,372 --> 00:32:24,236
- She's trapped...
- Don't!

77
00:32:29,847 --> 00:32:31,938
In that tiny box!

78
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:59,065
Look.

79
00:33:00,578 --> 00:33:01,940
Look!

80
00:33:03,781 --> 00:33:08,545
If you hadn't done it, she'd be here now!

81
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:19,328
I'm sorry... I'm sorry

82
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:27,864
I'm so sorry...

83
00:34:08,913 --> 00:34:13,882
I saved one for you too.

84
00:36:33,124 --> 00:36:36,819
Can't have one without the other.

85
00:36:38,129 --> 00:36:40,094
Shoko and Kyoko...

86
00:36:41,332 --> 00:36:44,458
Together, a perfect pair.

87
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:53,733
You're one and the same to me.

88
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:03,874
The dream...

89
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:11,386
always ends just there.

90
00:38:45,423 --> 00:38:46,785
Good morning.

91
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:53,324
Good morning.

92
00:38:57,468 --> 00:39:00,128
In reality...

93
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:07,243
we've been together since birth.

94
00:39:08,779 --> 00:39:12,382
I had a weird dream.

95
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:14,011
Me too.

96
00:39:32,803 --> 00:39:34,302
But then...

97
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,565
our dreams...

98
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:41,502
differ slightly.

99
00:41:45,094 --> 00:41:47,788
Mrs. Li? You're so beautiful.

100
00:41:48,131 --> 00:41:50,766
They say your dumplings
are the most expensive.

101
00:41:51,067 --> 00:41:53,260
Of course! Please come in.

102
00:41:55,205 --> 00:41:56,839
You've come in the right time!

103
00:41:57,140 --> 00:42:00,232
The water is just boiling, waiting for you.

104
00:42:07,016 --> 00:42:09,778
Actually, I know who you are

105
00:42:10,119 --> 00:42:13,222
I watched you on TV very often
when I first came to Hong Kong.

106
00:42:13,523 --> 00:42:14,523
You were the best!

107
00:42:14,824 --> 00:42:16,391
I quit acting a long time ago.

108
00:42:21,631 --> 00:42:23,221
Please, have a seat.

109
00:42:23,766 --> 00:42:25,458
Mrs. Li, guess how old I am.

110
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:34,872
I suppose...

111
00:42:35,612 --> 00:42:37,873
you're in your thirties at most

112
00:42:39,582 --> 00:42:43,243
I'm much older than that;
everyone calls me Aunt Mei.

113
00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:48,891
But you don't have any wrinkles.

114
00:42:49,192 --> 00:42:51,493
And I have fair skin, too

115
00:42:51,794 --> 00:42:55,022
I'm my own best advertisement.

116
00:42:56,266 --> 00:42:58,994
Your skin is great; I'm impressed.

117
00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:03,305
My dumplings are worth it.

118
00:43:03,606 --> 00:43:06,539
You get what you pay for.

119
00:43:58,928 --> 00:44:01,096
Mrs. Li...

120
00:44:01,397 --> 00:44:03,658
Want me to put in more cabbage?

121
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:05,965
It's up to you.

122
00:44:06,536 --> 00:44:07,696
The Northerners always say...

123
00:44:07,837 --> 00:44:11,674
"Good feeling comes from a nap,
good taste comes from a dumpling."

124
00:44:11,975 --> 00:44:15,340
Dumplings have existed in China
for more than 1400 years.

125
00:44:16,813 --> 00:44:18,714
But the Southerners still say...

126
00:44:19,015 --> 00:44:23,176
they're just dough stuffed
with meat, nothing special!

127
00:44:31,861 --> 00:44:35,297
I use high-gluten flour...

128
00:44:35,598 --> 00:44:37,766
for texture and chewiness

129
00:44:38,067 --> 00:44:41,036
I knead it fine...

130
00:44:41,337 --> 00:44:44,707
until it is like a peeled egg.

131
00:44:45,008 --> 00:44:48,874
Smooth, translucent, and soft.

132
00:44:53,016 --> 00:44:57,109
There's a secret to keep the
filling from leaking out.

133
00:45:39,629 --> 00:45:43,130
So that the juicy flavor
explodes in the mouth.

134
00:45:44,367 --> 00:45:46,201
Eat while it's warm

135
00:45:46,502 --> 00:45:49,605
I eat these often.

136
00:45:49,906 --> 00:45:51,997
Sometimes in soup...

137
00:45:52,308 --> 00:45:54,899
sometimes minced and steamed
with citrus peel.

138
00:46:07,757 --> 00:46:12,294
Just think of the results, not what it was.

139
00:46:30,146 --> 00:46:32,014
For women to rejuvenate...

140
00:46:32,315 --> 00:46:36,146
you must start from the inside
for the best result.

141
00:46:39,021 --> 00:46:41,954
Only my secret formula can do this.

142
00:46:47,530 --> 00:46:49,164
Let me sing for you.

143
00:46:49,465 --> 00:46:52,134
Well, it's kind of a custom of mine

144
00:46:52,435 --> 00:46:55,137
I often sing songs from my youth
after my customers eat.

145
00:46:55,438 --> 00:46:58,473
Take it as an entertainment; listen:

146
00:47:01,778 --> 00:47:09,451
"The water of Hung Lake is rough."

147
00:47:09,752 --> 00:47:17,452
"My home is on the shore."

148
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:25,460
"At dawn, boats go out with nets."

149
00:47:25,868 --> 00:47:33,568
"At dusk, they return loaded with fish."

150
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:41,049
"Wild ducks and lotus roots are here."

151
00:47:41,350 --> 00:47:45,888
"Autumns are bountiful with rice."

152
00:47:46,189 --> 00:47:53,228
"They say heaven is beautiful."

153
00:47:53,529 --> 00:48:01,229
"How can it compare with Hung Lake."

154
00:48:56,959 --> 00:48:58,686
You were already on a trip last week.

155
00:48:59,795 --> 00:49:02,090
You promised to stay for
our 15th anniversary

156
00:49:03,232 --> 00:49:05,527
I'm just going for a few days

157
00:49:06,502 --> 00:49:08,236
I'll try to come back early.

158
00:49:08,537 --> 00:49:10,571
It's boring here in the hotel.

159
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:14,575
We'll move into our new home as
soon as the renovation is over.

160
00:49:22,385 --> 00:49:24,505
See if there's anything else
we need in the new house.

161
00:49:27,723 --> 00:49:29,222
So many "zeroes"?

162
00:49:31,861 --> 00:49:33,724
You used to laugh a lot.

163
00:49:34,597 --> 00:49:36,460
Now even a big fat check
can't make you happy.

164
00:49:37,066 --> 00:49:38,233
You're not taking me along.

165
00:49:38,534 --> 00:49:42,001
Why should I be happy?

166
00:49:43,072 --> 00:49:44,673
I'll be gone for only 4, 5 days.

167
00:49:44,974 --> 00:49:46,507
And if more?

168
00:49:49,111 --> 00:49:51,736
I'll write you another check as a fine.

169
00:49:52,648 --> 00:49:54,739
Fines are for mistakes.

170
00:49:55,785 --> 00:49:57,147
Whatever.

171
00:50:00,923 --> 00:50:03,058
About that contract,
if you don't send over soon...

172
00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:04,559
I'm going to change my mind.

173
00:50:06,529 --> 00:50:10,224
Shenzhen, China.

174
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:22,244
I went through so much to get these.

175
00:50:22,545 --> 00:50:26,214
- They're stepping up the surveillance.
- Because some paparazzi have come

176
00:50:26,515 --> 00:50:28,139
Hong Kong media is so nosy.

177
00:50:28,451 --> 00:50:30,485
Just don't show up in the next two weeks.

178
00:50:30,786 --> 00:50:32,988
Even the locals can't get
a hold of the stock now.

179
00:50:33,289 --> 00:50:33,755
We'll see.

180
00:50:34,056 --> 00:50:36,647
- Thanks -This is for you

181
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:38,794
China-Hong Kong Border.

182
00:50:39,095 --> 00:50:40,162
This way, miss.

183
00:50:40,463 --> 00:50:41,393
This way, miss.

184
00:50:47,436 --> 00:50:48,935
- Put it through - Over there?

185
00:50:49,572 --> 00:50:51,469
- The lunchbox - Okay.

186
00:51:14,697 --> 00:51:15,786
Mrs. Li.

187
00:51:17,733 --> 00:51:19,698
Ever consider having children?

188
00:51:21,904 --> 00:51:24,940
We just can't; don't know if
it's his problem or mine...

189
00:51:25,241 --> 00:51:28,367
Don't worry, you'll soon
regain your youth...

190
00:51:29,745 --> 00:51:32,006
so as the heart of your man.

191
00:51:45,528 --> 00:51:48,028
Do you have more potent stuff
for faster results?

192
00:51:50,232 --> 00:51:53,502
The best are those in the 5th or 6th month.

193
00:51:53,803 --> 00:51:57,134
Have to remove it only by breaking
the water sac, then sliding it out.

194
00:51:57,673 --> 00:52:00,575
It's covered by a layer of creamy fat.

195
00:52:00,876 --> 00:52:04,139
The colors are defined;
you can even see the cranium.

196
00:52:05,781 --> 00:52:08,315
Its tiny limbs would still be moving around.

197
00:52:10,386 --> 00:52:12,921
It's only this small in the 1st trimester.

198
00:52:13,222 --> 00:52:17,122
But the meat would be too tough
by the third trimester.

199
00:52:17,493 --> 00:52:20,629
The 5th month ones are perfect, kitten-like.

200
00:52:20,930 --> 00:52:23,362
So cute and so nutritious.

201
00:52:24,166 --> 00:52:26,291
Let me show you

202
00:52:56,966 --> 00:52:59,334
I'm serving it pan-fried this time.

203
00:52:59,635 --> 00:53:02,966
We can always try some
other styles next time.

204
00:53:06,375 --> 00:53:09,444
What's this crunchiness about?

205
00:53:10,112 --> 00:53:13,982
It's okay, they have hands
and feet already, you know.

206
00:53:14,283 --> 00:53:15,383
And ears, too!

207
00:53:15,684 --> 00:53:16,618
Those were bones?

208
00:53:16,919 --> 00:53:18,887
Nah... their bones are hardly hard

209
00:53:19,188 --> 00:53:21,256
I'll just chop finer next time.

210
00:53:22,958 --> 00:53:25,424
Simmer in broth next
time; taste less greasy.

211
00:53:26,095 --> 00:53:29,130
Broth is good; it keeps all the juices.

212
00:53:30,332 --> 00:53:31,456
Are you done?

213
00:53:46,749 --> 00:53:47,816
This can't go on.

214
00:53:48,117 --> 00:53:49,047
Pardon?

215
00:53:50,085 --> 00:53:52,983
My skin is still flabby.

216
00:53:58,661 --> 00:54:00,362
No! It's much better!

217
00:54:00,663 --> 00:54:03,565
I need your most potent stuff.

218
00:54:03,866 --> 00:54:05,634
Trust me, I'll find it.

219
00:54:05,935 --> 00:54:08,026
It's time for me to sing.

220
00:54:08,904 --> 00:54:10,805
Suit yourself, but I must go.

221
00:54:11,106 --> 00:54:13,037
Bye, Mrs. Li.

222
00:54:14,009 --> 00:54:15,667
This way!

223
00:54:16,512 --> 00:54:18,513
Don't worry, I'll find it for you.

224
00:54:18,814 --> 00:54:19,748
Call me when you do.

225
00:54:20,049 --> 00:54:21,810
Trust me.

226
00:54:24,386 --> 00:54:25,919
Aunt Mei?

227
00:54:26,455 --> 00:54:27,222
You are...

228
00:54:27,523 --> 00:54:29,147
I'm a friend of Mrs. Kam.

229
00:54:29,825 --> 00:54:32,519
Oh, hello dear, c'mon in!

230
00:54:51,547 --> 00:54:53,381
From now on, you don't have to work anymore.

231
00:54:53,682 --> 00:54:54,616
And live off you?

232
00:54:54,917 --> 00:54:57,719
I can afford that, given you're
so slim and eat so little.

233
00:54:58,020 --> 00:55:01,886
- Not true; I love to eat.
- And you love to laugh, too.

234
00:55:06,462 --> 00:55:07,995
Relax.

235
00:55:09,098 --> 00:55:13,068
You're almost there; it's
been 18 hours already.

236
00:55:13,369 --> 00:55:14,766
Relax.

237
00:55:15,070 --> 00:55:18,333
You must try to relax, dear.

238
00:55:18,674 --> 00:55:20,809
Will she be all right?

239
00:55:21,110 --> 00:55:21,869
Of course.

240
00:55:22,711 --> 00:55:26,314
Try to relax.

241
00:55:26,615 --> 00:55:28,216
Your cervix has not fully dilated yet.

242
00:55:28,517 --> 00:55:31,051
Poor girl, you're not even fully grown.

243
00:55:35,024 --> 00:55:37,625
We women must protect ourselves.

244
00:55:37,926 --> 00:55:39,246
Don't let others bully you again.

245
00:55:41,764 --> 00:55:42,888
The water broke!

246
00:55:47,002 --> 00:55:47,802
It's okay.

247
00:55:48,103 --> 00:55:49,170
Don't be nervous.

248
00:55:49,605 --> 00:55:52,774
I swear it will be over in 10 seconds.

249
00:55:53,075 --> 00:55:54,506
Breathe deeply!

250
00:55:55,144 --> 00:55:56,978
Work with me, okay? Relax.

251
00:55:57,279 --> 00:55:59,176
Hold on...

252
00:56:03,485 --> 00:56:05,820
Relax...

253
00:56:06,121 --> 00:56:07,586
Cry if you want to.

254
00:56:08,123 --> 00:56:09,624
It's fully dilated!

255
00:56:09,925 --> 00:56:11,626
Stay calm! And on my count...

256
00:56:11,927 --> 00:56:14,689
One, two, three!

257
00:56:16,732 --> 00:56:17,628
Where are my tongs?

258
00:56:18,967 --> 00:56:20,227
Relax!

259
00:56:32,648 --> 00:56:34,181
Try to relax.

260
00:56:41,957 --> 00:56:43,024
Beautiful.

261
00:56:44,493 --> 00:56:46,194
Don't be sad, my dear.

262
00:56:46,495 --> 00:56:48,790
There's no more life in this baby.

263
00:57:12,921 --> 00:57:15,790
Want some snacks?

264
00:57:16,091 --> 00:57:17,954
I'll do steamed dumplings this time.

265
00:57:20,362 --> 00:57:22,453
Need some wine, too.

266
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:40,128
It was a boy.

267
00:59:41,069 --> 00:59:42,193
A boy?

268
00:59:44,573 --> 00:59:47,801
See that little thing?

269
00:59:50,412 --> 00:59:51,946
So beautiful and rare.

270
00:59:52,247 --> 00:59:54,616
Boys don't get aborted in China

271
00:59:54,917 --> 00:59:58,786
I didn't use any oxytocin, just a catheter.

272
00:59:59,087 --> 01:00:01,212
Drugs make it inedible.

273
01:00:02,424 --> 01:00:04,192
It will damage your nervous system.

274
01:00:04,493 --> 01:00:06,494
It's a first-born, the most nutritious.

275
01:00:06,795 --> 01:00:09,030
Nothing in this world
can beat this nutrition.

276
01:00:09,331 --> 01:00:11,966
The mother's a schoolgirl.

277
01:00:12,267 --> 01:00:14,902
Young and healthy.

278
01:00:15,203 --> 01:00:16,634
Then get working!

279
01:00:17,873 --> 01:00:19,065
What's the style today?

280
01:01:33,248 --> 01:01:37,580
This will make you feel like new.

281
01:01:57,472 --> 01:01:58,470
Hello?

282
01:02:14,222 --> 01:02:15,812
My husband broke his leg.

283
01:02:57,833 --> 01:03:01,630
Now you need me.

284
01:03:03,705 --> 01:03:08,105
Normally you wouldn't care where I go.

285
01:03:36,805 --> 01:03:38,497
You smell nice...

286
01:03:41,877 --> 01:03:43,774
look nice.

287
01:03:46,681 --> 01:03:48,612
You haven't touched me in ages.

288
01:03:59,327 --> 01:04:03,056
Thirsty? I'll get water.

289
01:06:38,887 --> 01:06:39,976
It's so hot in the street.

290
01:06:42,324 --> 01:06:43,791
And we must go to Mongkok next.

291
01:06:44,092 --> 01:06:46,360
Darn! I forgot about that.

292
01:06:46,661 --> 01:06:47,828
Two more trunks to move.

293
01:06:48,129 --> 01:06:50,720
- Woe is me -Big trunks, too.

294
01:06:51,599 --> 01:06:52,688
What's wrong?

295
01:06:54,936 --> 01:06:56,404
- What is this?
- What is it?

296
01:06:56,705 --> 01:06:59,239
- It's blood -My goodness!

297
01:07:01,142 --> 01:07:02,266
Here's a tissue.

298
01:07:02,610 --> 01:07:03,911
Whose blood is this?!

299
01:07:04,212 --> 01:07:06,580
Kate? Are you all right?

300
01:07:06,881 --> 01:07:09,116
Kate... What's going on?!

301
01:07:09,417 --> 01:07:12,850
Answer me, Kate! Answer me!

302
01:07:13,188 --> 01:07:18,191
Kate? Are you all right? What's going on?!

303
01:07:18,793 --> 01:07:20,561
Something is going on here.

304
01:07:20,862 --> 01:07:22,953
- She must have taken something.
- Definitely.

305
01:07:23,264 --> 01:07:24,922
Mrs. Li.

306
01:07:25,333 --> 01:07:27,799
You look fabulous! Absolutely radiant!

307
01:07:29,004 --> 01:07:31,834
- Talking behind my back?
- No!

308
01:07:32,507 --> 01:07:33,441
Just praising your look

309
01:07:33,742 --> 01:07:34,900
I'll catch up later.

310
01:07:37,412 --> 01:07:38,846
You're so late...

311
01:07:39,147 --> 01:07:41,716
Perhaps she finds herself a guru.

312
01:07:42,017 --> 01:07:44,652
Or better, "voodoo".

313
01:07:44,953 --> 01:07:48,284
That's scary!

314
01:07:50,158 --> 01:07:56,163
Mrs. Li, stop busying yourself, join us.

315
01:07:56,631 --> 01:07:58,265
- Bon appetite -Thanks.

316
01:07:58,566 --> 01:08:01,134
The food smells kind of fishy.

317
01:08:01,603 --> 01:08:02,803
Yes.

318
01:08:03,104 --> 01:08:04,505
Is it the beef?

319
01:08:04,806 --> 01:08:05,573
The beef?

320
01:08:05,874 --> 01:08:08,008
It's the fish, I think.

321
01:08:08,309 --> 01:08:10,077
Really?

322
01:08:10,378 --> 01:08:12,571
I don't think so.

323
01:08:12,881 --> 01:08:15,916
There is a strange smell here.

324
01:08:17,118 --> 01:08:19,049
Something wrong with the food?

325
01:08:23,391 --> 01:08:25,015
God, the smell is horrible

326
01:08:26,127 --> 01:08:28,252
I've forgot to check something! Excuse me.

327
01:08:30,698 --> 01:08:33,494
Why is she so tense?

328
01:09:06,862 --> 01:09:08,054
Aunt Mei?

329
01:09:09,164 --> 01:09:10,754
What was this "best stuff"?

330
01:09:12,134 --> 01:09:13,301
What did you feed me?

331
01:09:13,602 --> 01:09:15,932
The fetus was sick, wasn't it?
Or, poisonous?

332
01:09:16,238 --> 01:09:18,135
This baby was hard to find.

333
01:09:18,774 --> 01:09:23,378
Available only because his father
is also his grandfather.

334
01:09:23,679 --> 01:09:24,939
One in a million, you know.

335
01:09:25,314 --> 01:09:26,472
A child of an incest?

336
01:09:27,149 --> 01:09:29,217
A cursed child turns me to this?!

337
01:09:30,552 --> 01:09:35,282
A cursed child has extra
potency, I tell you.

338
01:09:36,893 --> 01:09:39,561
Hey! Mrs. Li, Hurry!

339
01:09:39,862 --> 01:09:43,523
Turn on the TV! Channel 2
is rerunning your series!

340
01:09:52,909 --> 01:09:55,978
"Heard you have a crush on
the baby face next door."

341
01:09:56,279 --> 01:09:57,846
"No..."

342
01:09:58,147 --> 01:10:00,015
- "You sure?" - "No..."

343
01:10:00,316 --> 01:10:01,876
"The one you said looks like Alan Tam."

344
01:10:02,919 --> 01:10:05,153
"I never said so!"

345
01:10:05,454 --> 01:10:07,715
Mrs. Li, you crying?

346
01:10:08,424 --> 01:10:11,193
Don't be sad; be strong.

347
01:10:11,494 --> 01:10:13,619
Good night, Mrs. Li.

348
01:10:57,373 --> 01:11:00,375
Headaches? And rashes?

349
01:11:00,676 --> 01:11:04,312
It's just nerves! You
should be happy instead!

350
01:11:04,613 --> 01:11:08,581
You're 2 months pregnant!
We've confirmed it.

351
01:11:10,086 --> 01:11:12,347
- You sure?
- Absolutely

352
01:11:12,922 --> 01:11:15,257
Peter, you told me I couldn't conceive!

353
01:11:15,558 --> 01:11:18,193
Not anymore! Now you can!

354
01:11:18,494 --> 01:11:20,896
- You sure there's no mistake.
- Not a chance.

355
01:11:21,197 --> 01:11:25,600
This is the best news
for both Mr Li and you!

356
01:11:25,901 --> 01:11:28,236
I'll prescribe something
to ease your tension.

357
01:11:28,537 --> 01:11:31,834
You'll be fine in a couple of days.

358
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:40,082
- Nurse - Yes, Dr. Wong.

359
01:11:40,383 --> 01:11:43,611
Mrs. Li's chauffeur will come
pick up her medication.

360
01:11:44,487 --> 01:11:45,588
How many days' prescription?

361
01:11:45,688 --> 01:11:48,882
- Give her a week's worth - Okay.

362
01:12:14,850 --> 01:12:15,939
Don't move!

363
01:12:19,488 --> 01:12:22,148
Dispatch, we've arrived at 2103.

364
01:12:22,691 --> 01:12:26,352
Victim is male, badly cut;
we need an ambulance.

365
01:12:27,163 --> 01:12:30,391
We have his wife under control.

366
01:12:47,283 --> 01:12:48,407
Tell them to hurry.

367
01:12:48,851 --> 01:12:52,216
The victim is alive, please hurry!

368
01:13:23,452 --> 01:13:24,985
So much stuff left.

369
01:13:26,956 --> 01:13:30,048
What are these... so well-hidden?

370
01:14:08,497 --> 01:14:12,397
Shenzhen, China.

371
01:17:19,837 --> 01:17:20,537
CUT

372
01:18:20,865 --> 01:18:22,728
Hello?

373
01:18:24,335 --> 01:18:26,096
Just a minute.

374
01:18:28,439 --> 01:18:30,268
There, alright.

375
01:18:31,008 --> 01:18:35,670
No, I'm not busy... I
was just having dinner.

376
01:18:36,614 --> 01:18:38,614
Have you eaten?

377
01:18:39,483 --> 01:18:41,847
I can't finish it.

378
01:18:43,454 --> 01:18:45,681
Yeah, I've left it frozen.

379
01:18:48,693 --> 01:18:51,887
My stomach doesn't feel so good.

380
01:18:54,165 --> 01:18:55,599
Anyway...

381
01:18:55,900 --> 01:19:00,404
It's been 3 months since I moved here,
aren't you going to come over?

382
01:19:00,705 --> 01:19:02,205
How about tomorrow?

383
01:19:02,506 --> 01:19:04,870
We can have breakfast together...

384
01:19:05,242 --> 01:19:07,833
if you don't mind cold leftovers.

385
01:19:11,916 --> 01:19:14,280
You really want to hear me play?

386
01:19:42,513 --> 01:19:44,444
My stomach is really bothering me!

387
01:19:45,049 --> 01:19:46,912
I feel nauseous!

388
01:19:48,452 --> 01:19:51,419
Perhaps the food is past
its expiration date.

389
01:20:01,565 --> 01:20:05,965
Darling, it's killing me!

390
01:20:53,484 --> 01:20:55,609
And...

391
01:20:59,957 --> 01:21:00,857
What's scene 29 again?

392
01:21:01,158 --> 01:21:03,026
- Good-bye, sir -Good-bye!

393
01:21:03,327 --> 01:21:05,647
Scene 29 is where Young-Chae
draws blood with a water pump.

394
01:21:05,763 --> 01:21:06,763
Right...

395
01:21:07,064 --> 01:21:09,325
- Good-bye, sir!
- Good-bye!

396
01:21:11,035 --> 01:21:15,005
If we push it back to the 13th...

397
01:21:15,306 --> 01:21:18,141
Shoot the remaining inserts
during the morning of the 8th...

398
01:21:18,442 --> 01:21:21,311
and I'll finish editing
before the night shoot.

399
01:21:21,612 --> 01:21:23,513
Then the crew can catch
some sleep in between.

400
01:21:23,814 --> 01:21:26,249
But you won't get any sleep at all!

401
01:21:26,550 --> 01:21:28,790
Better just one, than all sixty
of the crew losing sleep.

402
01:21:29,053 --> 01:21:30,347
Quite true.

403
01:21:30,688 --> 01:21:32,881
- Take care, sir!
- Yeah, you too!

404
01:21:33,958 --> 01:21:35,992
Kyung-ah, get the guys
to do the heavy work!

405
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:37,961
I heard you're going to Seoul.

406
01:21:38,262 --> 01:21:39,896
- Could you drop me off at Hanam City?

407
01:21:40,197 --> 01:21:40,897
- Good-bye, sir!

408
01:21:41,098 --> 01:21:41,798
- Good-bye!

409
01:21:41,999 --> 01:21:42,232
- Good-bye, sir!

410
01:21:42,533 --> 01:21:43,233
- Good-bye!

411
01:21:43,534 --> 01:21:44,968
Sir... the daggers we talked about.

412
01:21:45,269 --> 01:21:46,393
Good work!

413
01:21:48,239 --> 01:21:51,069
Good work everyone!

414
01:21:54,378 --> 01:21:58,710
I ran over from Studio 3 as
soon as I heard you're here.

415
01:21:59,083 --> 01:22:02,209
Did you read the scripts I sent you?

416
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:04,855
What do you think? Which one should I do?

417
01:22:05,156 --> 01:22:07,591
"Pink Panty", go for "Pink Panty."

418
01:22:07,892 --> 01:22:09,892
They say director Jang is
the John Waters of Korea.

419
01:22:10,060 --> 01:22:12,762
Still... don't you think his
film is a little sinister?

420
01:22:13,063 --> 01:22:17,534
- Kim Chang's film seems better.
- Director Kim Chang...

421
01:22:17,835 --> 01:22:20,570
His film only makes the director look good.

422
01:22:20,871 --> 01:22:23,166
The actors don't get noticed at all.

423
01:22:23,941 --> 01:22:26,703
Just don't waste your time on him.

424
01:22:27,044 --> 01:22:28,778
What about this...

425
01:22:29,079 --> 01:22:31,348
Trying something other than Mr. Nice Guy?

426
01:22:31,649 --> 01:22:33,876
Like a psycho-rapist-killer thing... huh?!

427
01:22:36,153 --> 01:22:37,083
Huh?!

428
01:22:37,855 --> 01:22:41,891
Don't worry, I ate already...
Just go back to your work.

429
01:22:42,426 --> 01:22:44,461
We can have breakfast together tomorrow

430
01:22:44,762 --> 01:22:47,695
I'll take care of it if you
don't mind cold leftovers.

431
01:22:48,899 --> 01:22:50,834
You should have come to see the set!

432
01:22:51,135 --> 01:22:52,802
It looks just like our house...

433
01:22:53,103 --> 01:22:56,400
Hey, I got the music for the film!
Listen to this...

434
01:24:23,494 --> 01:24:26,062
The rehearsal will end late!
Don't forget your veggie diet!

435
01:26:22,946 --> 01:26:24,536
You've got...

436
01:26:26,283 --> 01:26:29,250
such pretty hands, ma'am.

437
01:26:36,160 --> 01:26:38,561
There's jewelry in the bedroom!

438
01:26:38,862 --> 01:26:41,364
Take it all! Just don't hurt anyone!

439
01:26:41,665 --> 01:26:43,027
Please, let us go!

440
01:26:54,478 --> 01:26:56,443
Darn...

441
01:26:56,780 --> 01:27:01,151
You're not supposed to start
off with this kind of talk!

442
01:27:01,452 --> 01:27:06,922
You shouldn't have started begging
until... like 20 minutes later.

443
01:27:07,224 --> 01:27:11,594
"Wait"... till things fall apart first!

444
01:27:11,895 --> 01:27:14,531
You are, after all, the head of the house.

445
01:27:14,832 --> 01:27:22,532
If you're only capable of "begging"
from the onset...

446
01:27:23,407 --> 01:27:26,874
who else could your wife count on?

447
01:27:29,213 --> 01:27:35,251
Remember what happened when you
shot "Uninvited Guest" in 1998?

448
01:27:35,552 --> 01:27:40,589
When those gangsters
busted in on the shoot...

449
01:27:42,292 --> 01:27:43,760
"Stop it!"

450
01:27:44,061 --> 01:27:45,662
You shouted at them boldly!

451
01:27:45,963 --> 01:27:48,088
What happened to your guts now?

452
01:27:49,466 --> 01:27:50,867
Who are you?

453
01:27:51,168 --> 01:27:52,257
Who, me?

454
01:27:53,604 --> 01:27:56,264
Maybe you'll recognize me like this...

455
01:28:13,524 --> 01:28:14,955
Nope?

456
01:28:18,228 --> 01:28:20,796
Red Hunt! Huh?

457
01:28:44,521 --> 01:28:45,713
Water!

458
01:28:48,492 --> 01:28:49,923
Water!

459
01:28:51,929 --> 01:28:54,725
Water...

460
01:28:57,034 --> 01:28:59,102
What the hell!

461
01:29:00,737 --> 01:29:02,138
Ready, huh?!

462
01:29:02,439 --> 01:29:04,063
Action, huh?

463
01:29:07,277 --> 01:29:09,504
And... CUT!

464
01:29:26,063 --> 01:29:27,897
She's a pianist...

465
01:29:28,198 --> 01:29:31,995
I know that of course!
I've done my research.

466
01:29:32,469 --> 01:29:35,838
Got to be the pianist's fingers
for the "cut" to mean something.

467
01:29:36,139 --> 01:29:40,777
Only an idiot would want her toes instead!

468
01:29:41,078 --> 01:29:42,979
Honey!

469
01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:46,983
Honey, I'll... take care of this somehow.

470
01:29:47,284 --> 01:29:50,386
Honey, are you alright? It
hurts a lot, doesn't it?

471
01:29:50,687 --> 01:29:53,483
I still don't know what's going on...

472
01:29:54,057 --> 01:29:56,859
But I'm sure... we can
get out of this somehow.

473
01:29:57,160 --> 01:29:58,591
Just trust me, okay?

474
01:29:59,663 --> 01:30:01,030
Does it hurt a lot, honey?

475
01:30:01,331 --> 01:30:04,167
Try and bear it a little longer!
Do that for me, okay?

476
01:30:04,468 --> 01:30:05,899
It will be all over soon

477
01:30:06,970 --> 01:30:11,174
I'll... I'll make sure you can play again

478
01:30:11,475 --> 01:30:13,907
I love you, honey.

479
01:30:14,244 --> 01:30:16,972
Let's be strong.

480
01:30:17,314 --> 01:30:20,110
One way or another, I'll...

481
01:30:27,057 --> 01:30:28,590
I remember you now!

482
01:30:28,992 --> 01:30:29,854
Yeah?

483
01:30:31,862 --> 01:30:32,951
An Extra.

484
01:30:35,999 --> 01:30:41,127
I was in all five of your films, sir!

485
01:30:42,806 --> 01:30:45,575
You were such a kind man...

486
01:30:45,876 --> 01:30:49,445
unlike any other directors
I've ever worked with.

487
01:30:49,746 --> 01:30:53,349
So kind, no matter what mistakes I made.

488
01:30:53,650 --> 01:31:00,023
Remember the mob scene in "The Desert"?

489
01:31:00,324 --> 01:31:03,459
You were shooting the crowd
running in the distance.

490
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:06,362
Some moron knocked over
a hornet's nest as we ran

491
01:31:06,663 --> 01:31:10,358
I got stung, I freaked out
and I ruined the take.

492
01:31:10,867 --> 01:31:11,901
Naturally...

493
01:31:12,202 --> 01:31:15,505
The damn assistant director gave me hell.

494
01:31:15,806 --> 01:31:17,106
But then you said...

495
01:31:17,407 --> 01:31:20,977
How about using the time to set up
another take instead of yelling?

496
01:31:21,278 --> 01:31:23,312
It's not like he wanted to get stung.

497
01:31:24,981 --> 01:31:26,480
Is your neck okay?

498
01:31:38,428 --> 01:31:39,762
You were so sweet.

499
01:31:40,063 --> 01:31:44,930
But what's the use of all that?

500
01:31:46,503 --> 01:31:49,333
You don't even recognize me!

501
01:31:49,706 --> 01:31:51,007
Why are you doing this to me?

502
01:31:51,308 --> 01:31:53,509
What do you mean "Why"?

503
01:31:53,810 --> 01:31:57,641
"Because" this world is so fucked up!
That's why!

504
01:31:58,048 --> 01:32:00,216
Look at this, look!

505
01:32:00,517 --> 01:32:03,386
I didn't even know there are
houses like this in Korea!

506
01:32:03,687 --> 01:32:07,120
Lots of people are better off
than us! This house is merely...

507
01:32:09,192 --> 01:32:11,627
The rich people I've ever met...

508
01:32:11,928 --> 01:32:15,361
They're all scumbags, no respect for people.

509
01:32:15,799 --> 01:32:20,165
I don't even consider them as human beings.

510
01:32:21,938 --> 01:32:26,737
But you, you are a good man!

511
01:32:27,778 --> 01:32:32,248
That's so fucking unfair!

512
01:32:32,549 --> 01:32:35,818
You're rich, handsome,
educated in America...

513
01:32:36,119 --> 01:32:38,321
a genius director, and
you have a pretty wife!

514
01:32:38,622 --> 01:32:41,390
If you're also a "good"
man on top of that...

515
01:32:41,691 --> 01:32:45,488
what are guys like me supposed to get?!

516
01:32:47,397 --> 01:32:48,965
You know on TV shows...

517
01:32:49,266 --> 01:32:52,001
Only the poor folks are good people!
Never the rich!

518
01:32:52,302 --> 01:32:53,803
You've already got everything!

519
01:32:54,104 --> 01:32:56,973
Why do you have to corner us too?!

520
01:32:57,274 --> 01:32:59,742
Why are you a good man, too?

521
01:33:00,043 --> 01:33:03,746
You live well in this world and
you'll live well in heaven.

522
01:33:04,047 --> 01:33:07,617
Our lives suck and we're going to hell!

523
01:33:07,918 --> 01:33:12,622
This is totally outrageous!

524
01:33:12,923 --> 01:33:14,423
That's not true.

525
01:33:14,724 --> 01:33:16,684
"It's harder for a rich man
to get into heaven..."

526
01:33:16,960 --> 01:33:20,062
"than a camel to go through
the eye of a needle."

527
01:33:20,363 --> 01:33:21,083
It's in the Bible!

528
01:33:21,364 --> 01:33:23,125
Bullshit.

529
01:33:24,434 --> 01:33:27,230
It's easier for a rich man
to get into heaven...

530
01:33:27,637 --> 01:33:31,537
than putting a needle
into a camel's nostril!

531
01:33:33,143 --> 01:33:36,546
Face it, you've got no cause to sin.

532
01:33:36,847 --> 01:33:38,381
Of course I have.

533
01:33:38,682 --> 01:33:42,149
Then, prove it!

534
01:33:47,491 --> 01:33:48,591
What persistence

535
01:33:48,892 --> 01:33:50,186
I'm sorry...

536
01:34:03,540 --> 01:34:05,474
for being a good
person -Look at that!

537
01:34:05,775 --> 01:34:07,276
Look!

538
01:34:07,577 --> 01:34:10,111
What a good man?!

539
01:34:25,862 --> 01:34:28,965
I can let your wife go.

540
01:34:29,266 --> 01:34:31,667
On one condition...

541
01:34:31,968 --> 01:34:35,060
You have to kill someone right here!
Can you do that?

542
01:34:44,447 --> 01:34:46,482
I'll do as you wish.

543
01:34:46,783 --> 01:34:49,181
Let her go and I'll die in her place.

544
01:35:37,100 --> 01:35:39,168
You don't need to die.

545
01:35:39,469 --> 01:35:41,509
You just need to strangle
the little kid over there.

546
01:35:41,738 --> 01:35:44,507
If you don't, in every five minutes...

547
01:35:44,808 --> 01:35:46,976
I'll cut off another one
of your wife's fingers.

548
01:35:47,277 --> 01:35:50,608
Let's see how good you can stay!

549
01:35:53,750 --> 01:35:55,181
Ready...

550
01:35:55,585 --> 01:35:56,285
Go!

551
01:35:56,386 --> 01:35:57,586
Who is this kid?

552
01:35:57,887 --> 01:35:59,155
I don't know her either!

553
01:35:59,456 --> 01:36:02,457
Met her on my way here!
She looked bored so I brought her along.

554
01:36:29,653 --> 01:36:31,653
Guess what

555
01:36:32,022 --> 01:36:36,718
I've been dirt poor ever since I was a kid.

556
01:36:37,193 --> 01:36:42,465
My bastard father was always dead drunk.

557
01:36:42,766 --> 01:36:46,802
He beat the hell out of
us day in and day out.

558
01:36:47,103 --> 01:36:52,641
Needless to say my grades were bad.

559
01:36:52,942 --> 01:36:59,048
And this ugly face of mine could
get me nowhere near stardom.

560
01:36:59,349 --> 01:37:02,752
So you see, now I'm the one
who always gets drunk

561
01:37:03,053 --> 01:37:07,423
I go home and I kick my boy's ass.

562
01:37:07,724 --> 01:37:12,261
And, I beat my wife, too!

563
01:37:12,562 --> 01:37:14,797
When I sober up in the morning...

564
01:37:15,098 --> 01:37:17,533
and see that beat-up face of hers.

565
01:37:17,834 --> 01:37:20,403
Guess what I think of?

566
01:37:20,704 --> 01:37:23,204
Your face!

567
01:37:23,640 --> 01:37:29,245
Your nice handsome face overlapping hers...

568
01:37:29,546 --> 01:37:33,916
It makes perfect sense for a poor
kid to grow up to be a bastard...

569
01:37:34,217 --> 01:37:38,651
and a rich kid to grow up
to be a good man! That's fate!

570
01:37:47,864 --> 01:37:48,964
Damn it!

571
01:37:49,265 --> 01:37:50,466
Hell, no!

572
01:37:50,767 --> 01:37:53,199
No...

573
01:38:00,210 --> 01:38:02,574
Time flies.

574
01:38:12,589 --> 01:38:16,025
What should I do, honey? Whatever you say.

575
01:38:16,326 --> 01:38:17,290
Should I kill her?

576
01:38:18,328 --> 01:38:19,759
Don't kill her?

577
01:38:22,932 --> 01:38:28,060
What a decisive man, my goodness!
What a decisive man!

578
01:38:29,572 --> 01:38:33,542
Listen to me, life has many stages

579
01:38:33,843 --> 01:38:36,979
I went through many difficulties
before getting this far.

580
01:38:37,280 --> 01:38:41,484
It wasn't as easy as you think!
I didn't get it for free.

581
01:38:41,785 --> 01:38:42,952
Someone once said...

582
01:38:43,253 --> 01:38:46,021
"No time to blink, keep striving for..."

583
01:38:46,322 --> 01:38:48,624
Fuck that! I ain't stupid!

584
01:38:48,925 --> 01:38:50,359
It's a line from your own film!

585
01:38:50,660 --> 01:38:53,362
Jin says that to Rose in "Last Wish".

586
01:38:53,663 --> 01:38:57,433
Want me to follow suit?

587
01:38:57,734 --> 01:39:01,437
Remember the cabaret scene
in "Dancing Factory"?

588
01:39:01,738 --> 01:39:03,772
You wrote the song lyrics as well

589
01:39:04,073 --> 01:39:06,767
I did some dancing there, too.

590
01:39:33,336 --> 01:39:39,708
"I'm not going to listen
to your words anymore."

591
01:39:40,009 --> 01:39:43,345
"All are a pack of lies!
All out of hypocrisy!"

592
01:39:43,646 --> 01:39:51,118
"We'll make our own words."

593
01:39:53,790 --> 01:40:01,490
"We'll make our own truth."

594
01:40:03,633 --> 01:40:11,333
"I'm not going to listen
to your words anymore"

595
01:40:43,806 --> 01:40:45,737
I'm sorry little one.

596
01:40:46,409 --> 01:40:48,704
I really can't hold out

597
01:40:49,913 --> 01:40:51,241
I'm sorry!

598
01:40:56,085 --> 01:40:59,655
I ain't a good man...
You don't even know me!

599
01:40:59,956 --> 01:41:01,790
How can you prove that I'm a good man!

600
01:41:02,091 --> 01:41:05,126
The truth is...

601
01:41:05,728 --> 01:41:10,532
Whenever an actor ask for my advice

602
01:41:10,833 --> 01:41:13,663
I always persuade them not to
work with Director Kim Chang.

603
01:41:14,137 --> 01:41:15,499
Because...

604
01:41:18,441 --> 01:41:21,101
He's my sole rival.

605
01:41:21,611 --> 01:41:27,513
I can't stand that jerk having
any good actors in his films.

606
01:41:34,190 --> 01:41:38,124
You call this shit a confession?

607
01:41:38,428 --> 01:41:41,725
Do I look like an idiot to you?

608
01:41:43,333 --> 01:41:47,770
I've never said that you were a saint!

609
01:41:48,071 --> 01:41:52,801
Who the hell hasn't done a thing
as tedious as that?

610
01:41:53,176 --> 01:41:54,834
Give me a break.

611
01:41:56,479 --> 01:42:01,383
Let me show you what a confession really is.

612
01:42:01,684 --> 01:42:03,376
For example.

613
01:42:03,720 --> 01:42:06,755
Before I left home this
morning, I killed my wife

614
01:42:07,056 --> 01:42:09,147
I must have strangled her
for over 30 minutes.

615
01:42:10,626 --> 01:42:15,789
Her tongue hung out all the way
and she shitted everywhere.

616
01:42:16,733 --> 01:42:20,402
I was going to finish my son too,
but it was not that easy...

617
01:42:20,703 --> 01:42:24,534
I just couldn't do that...

618
01:42:26,676 --> 01:42:31,440
Now, that's what I call a confession!

619
01:42:32,081 --> 01:42:37,448
Your turn! Give me something nice and juicy.

620
01:42:40,456 --> 01:42:43,787
Wait! I'll talk! I'll talk!

621
01:42:49,298 --> 01:42:51,628
There's a wardrobe called Kyung-Ah.

622
01:42:54,170 --> 01:42:56,602
I offered to give her a ride home one day.

623
01:42:57,707 --> 01:43:00,275
I lied that her home was on my way.

624
01:43:02,245 --> 01:43:04,079
And then I drove her to a motel...

625
01:43:04,380 --> 01:43:08,348
We've been doing this for 3 years
already since "Bluebird".

626
01:43:12,355 --> 01:43:15,257
Love isn't a sin.

627
01:43:15,558 --> 01:43:17,993
We dropped by a motel tonight, too.

628
01:43:18,294 --> 01:43:21,124
Lakeside Motel, room 304.

629
01:43:22,465 --> 01:43:25,432
We did it twice in three hours... No

630
01:43:25,735 --> 01:43:27,928
three times in two hours

631
01:43:30,673 --> 01:43:32,468
I'm really sorry, honey.

632
01:43:34,210 --> 01:43:38,940
Shouldn't have told you this when
you're already suffering so much.

633
01:43:40,950 --> 01:43:42,745
It hurts a lot, doesn't it?

634
01:43:45,488 --> 01:43:46,816
But then...

635
01:43:51,627 --> 01:43:53,888
You shouldn't mind this.

636
01:43:54,664 --> 01:43:58,700
You've never had any real pains in
your life, and no worries either.

637
01:43:59,869 --> 01:44:02,631
Know why I like Kyung-Ah?

638
01:44:05,575 --> 01:44:11,980
Unlike you, she's smart and
we can talk about many things.

639
01:44:12,281 --> 01:44:15,217
As for you, I'd rather you
not to talk to me at all.

640
01:44:15,518 --> 01:44:20,021
All you care to talk about are
clothes and plastic surgery!

641
01:44:21,224 --> 01:44:23,325
When I make love to you...

642
01:44:23,626 --> 01:44:27,796
I'm not sure whether I'm holding
a woman or a bag of silicon.

643
01:44:28,097 --> 01:44:29,562
Guess how old my wife is.

644
01:44:32,468 --> 01:44:34,236
Just one year younger than me...

645
01:44:34,537 --> 01:44:36,605
but already a Botox junkie.

646
01:44:36,906 --> 01:44:38,808
Now her expression doesn't
change even if she smiles.

647
01:44:38,908 --> 01:44:41,343
What she has is not a face but a mask.

648
01:44:41,644 --> 01:44:44,012
And that mask yelps at me everyday

649
01:44:44,313 --> 01:44:46,648
"I love you, honey!"

650
01:44:46,949 --> 01:44:52,921
Mi-ran, be honest for just
this once in your life.

651
01:44:53,222 --> 01:44:55,357
Do you know what love is?

652
01:44:55,658 --> 01:44:57,793
Don't pity yourself for losing your fingers.

653
01:44:58,094 --> 01:45:01,230
They don't deserve any tears.

654
01:45:01,531 --> 01:45:03,599
Because you can play shit.

655
01:45:03,900 --> 01:45:05,468
Plus, you don't cook and you never clean...

656
01:45:05,568 --> 01:45:11,231
You hands have no use anyway
other than wearing jewelry.

657
01:45:12,575 --> 01:45:14,376
Listen.

658
01:45:14,677 --> 01:45:17,379
What is an artist without talent?

659
01:45:17,680 --> 01:45:18,914
"Nada."

660
01:45:19,215 --> 01:45:23,352
Not existing! A "nothing".

661
01:45:23,653 --> 01:45:31,285
Like a ring without a hole
or a square ball! Get it?

662
01:45:32,161 --> 01:45:35,330
If you can't play, it'll
be nice and quiet here.

663
01:45:35,631 --> 01:45:36,959
Also...

664
01:45:37,400 --> 01:45:40,492
It's so much lighter for
you to wave "Bye-bye"!

665
01:45:41,304 --> 01:45:43,201
No, no, no, not yet.

666
01:45:45,408 --> 01:45:49,569
There's something else
I've been trying to say...

667
01:45:50,413 --> 01:45:53,414
I've been holding it back
for a whole 10 years now.

668
01:45:54,584 --> 01:45:55,878
Curious?

669
01:45:58,487 --> 01:46:00,714
Screw you, bitch!

670
01:46:07,997 --> 01:46:10,565
Truth is, she has an affair too.

671
01:46:10,866 --> 01:46:13,535
Know the tenor she plays accompaniment for?

672
01:46:13,836 --> 01:46:15,971
He's her lover! Do you know?

673
01:46:16,272 --> 01:46:19,466
I saw it all when I was
following her around.

674
01:46:19,909 --> 01:46:24,241
Am I wrong? Speak up for yourself.

675
01:46:24,580 --> 01:46:27,816
Oh, I forgot you're gagged.

676
01:46:28,117 --> 01:46:30,786
But you can nod, can't you?

677
01:46:31,087 --> 01:46:35,146
Do what you should do!

678
01:46:37,660 --> 01:46:40,262
Ah... You already knew!

679
01:46:40,563 --> 01:46:42,631
Didn't you? Didn't you?

680
01:46:44,233 --> 01:46:46,028
How about this

681
01:46:47,169 --> 01:46:49,504
I'm kind of depressed.

682
01:46:49,805 --> 01:46:52,140
So if you really want to buy some time...

683
01:46:52,441 --> 01:46:54,409
you can try to make me laugh.

684
01:46:54,710 --> 01:46:58,013
Every time you succeed, I'll extend
the deadline for another 5 minutes.

685
01:46:58,314 --> 01:47:01,450
You've made good comedies.

686
01:47:01,751 --> 01:47:06,982
Now, you can try your hand on acting in one.

687
01:47:07,556 --> 01:47:08,782
Okay.

688
01:47:10,293 --> 01:47:11,426
Ready and...

689
01:47:11,727 --> 01:47:13,294
You son of a bitch!

690
01:47:13,929 --> 01:47:17,699
You... you've never seen me
losing my temper, right?

691
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,364
I'm going to show it to you now.

692
01:47:20,903 --> 01:47:22,771
You son of a bitch.

693
01:47:23,072 --> 01:47:27,042
Your dad was a moron and
he made you a loser.

694
01:47:27,343 --> 01:47:28,510
Is that my fault?

695
01:47:28,811 --> 01:47:31,013
Did I rob your blank?!

696
01:47:31,314 --> 01:47:34,449
Did I steal your wife?

697
01:47:34,750 --> 01:47:37,252
What do I have to do with
your unhappy existence?

698
01:47:37,553 --> 01:47:40,155
Shame on you, moron.

699
01:47:40,456 --> 01:47:45,186
Why don't you just kill yourself?
Your life is a waste of time anyway.

700
01:47:45,594 --> 01:47:47,321
Want me to make you laugh?

701
01:47:47,797 --> 01:47:50,432
Do you know who you're talking to?

702
01:47:50,733 --> 01:47:55,437
I'm Ryu Ji-ho, "the" Ryu Ji-ho!

703
01:47:55,738 --> 01:47:58,204
You're merely a lowlife extra!
Want me to make you... what?

704
01:47:59,008 --> 01:48:02,271
Get the hell out of here.

705
01:48:02,778 --> 01:48:05,247
Just untie me and go home!

706
01:48:05,548 --> 01:48:08,981
Go fix your son some
instant noodles, okay?!

707
01:48:12,455 --> 01:48:17,192
You've freaked me out and corrupted me!

708
01:48:17,493 --> 01:48:20,084
Your mission has been completed!

709
01:48:20,663 --> 01:48:22,731
I'll never mention what happened today.

710
01:48:23,032 --> 01:48:25,367
If you want her fingers this much...

711
01:48:25,668 --> 01:48:27,565
cut them all off!

712
01:48:28,104 --> 01:48:29,905
Or better, just cut off her hands!

713
01:48:30,206 --> 01:48:34,402
Why bother cutting off
her fingers one by one?

714
01:48:35,111 --> 01:48:38,246
Just finish it quickly and
get the hell out of here

715
01:48:38,547 --> 01:48:40,308
I want nothing more.

716
01:48:42,118 --> 01:48:43,276
No, wait!

717
01:48:55,531 --> 01:48:57,531
My closing statement.

718
01:50:01,664 --> 01:50:06,258
You've never gone for cheap laugh
like this in your comedies.

719
01:50:07,369 --> 01:50:11,006
You're so disappointing!

720
01:50:11,307 --> 01:50:12,704
Wait, wait!

721
01:50:13,175 --> 01:50:15,877
I was too wound up and... I made mistakes

722
01:50:16,178 --> 01:50:19,770
I swear I didn't mean to do so...
Wait! Wait!

723
01:50:23,319 --> 01:50:25,011
What are you doing now?

724
01:50:26,355 --> 01:50:28,013
What are you doing?

725
01:50:30,226 --> 01:50:32,226
Wait, wait, wait.

726
01:50:32,695 --> 01:50:34,854
Give me one more chance.

727
01:50:35,264 --> 01:50:38,366
Just give me one more try!
Please! I beg you!

728
01:50:38,667 --> 01:50:43,431
My pose was bad, and I couldn't
help making that kind of mistakes.

729
01:50:43,939 --> 01:50:45,541
Don't be so inflexible!
Just once more chance...

730
01:50:45,641 --> 01:50:46,935
Damn it.

731
01:50:50,513 --> 01:50:56,142
I shouldn't have given
you any false hope...

732
01:50:57,086 --> 01:51:00,622
Nowadays, if you get to
the hospital within 10 hours...

733
01:51:00,923 --> 01:51:03,514
they can reattach the fingers neatly.

734
01:51:13,903 --> 01:51:18,372
No! Wait! I'll do it! I'll kill her!
Look, I'm doing it now!

735
01:51:20,409 --> 01:51:21,509
You bastard!

736
01:51:21,810 --> 01:51:23,935
I said I was going to do it!

737
01:51:24,847 --> 01:51:27,211
Why didn't you wait?!

738
01:51:33,222 --> 01:51:38,059
You saw it too! You know I have no choice.

739
01:51:38,360 --> 01:51:40,262
Honey, I'm going to do it, okay?

740
01:51:40,563 --> 01:51:43,164
That was three... Three, so, seven...

741
01:51:43,465 --> 01:51:45,700
You'll keep your seven, honey!

742
01:51:46,001 --> 01:51:49,070
I'm not doing this because
I hate you, okay?

743
01:51:50,172 --> 01:51:53,508
You think I'm doing this
because I hate your wife?

744
01:51:53,809 --> 01:51:56,104
"Hate" is nobody's fault.

745
01:51:56,545 --> 01:52:02,450
For example, who do you think
she hates more right now?

746
01:52:02,751 --> 01:52:04,653
Me or you?

747
01:52:04,954 --> 01:52:07,614
Let's hear it!

748
01:52:08,791 --> 01:52:09,591
Kill her!

749
01:52:09,892 --> 01:52:12,893
Kill her! What are you waiting for, idiot?

750
01:52:13,262 --> 01:52:18,095
Kill her! Kill her!

751
01:52:22,638 --> 01:52:24,899
You see?

752
01:52:26,809 --> 01:52:32,245
Easy, ma'am.

753
01:52:32,615 --> 01:52:35,912
You probably will get one
finger left on each hand.

754
01:52:36,318 --> 01:52:40,377
He's got to give in by that time.

755
01:52:41,724 --> 01:52:44,659
You can still become a percussionist.

756
01:52:44,960 --> 01:52:48,291
No law against playing drums
with "Chopsticks".

757
01:52:49,264 --> 01:52:54,768
Common folks like me prefer
drum beats to music.

758
01:52:55,337 --> 01:52:58,429
No! No!

759
01:54:51,420 --> 01:54:56,583
You're right, better to
just cut off her whole hand.

760
01:55:01,463 --> 01:55:05,090
Damn time flies...

761
01:55:06,101 --> 01:55:07,902
47 seconds...

762
01:55:08,203 --> 01:55:10,100
46 seconds...

763
01:55:10,539 --> 01:55:12,340
- No!
- 45 seconds...

764
01:55:12,641 --> 01:55:16,677
44 seconds, 43 seconds

765
01:55:17,146 --> 01:55:21,049
42 seconds, 41 seconds

766
01:55:21,350 --> 01:55:25,119
40 seconds, 39 seconds

767
01:55:25,420 --> 01:55:29,286
38 seconds, 37 seconds

768
01:55:30,859 --> 01:55:34,162
36 seconds, 35 seconds...

769
01:55:34,463 --> 01:55:38,397
34 seconds, 33 seconds

770
01:55:38,934 --> 01:55:43,198
32 seconds, 31 seconds

771
01:55:43,705 --> 01:55:45,507
30 seconds, 29 seconds

772
01:55:45,808 --> 01:55:47,542
25 seconds...

773
01:55:47,843 --> 01:55:49,844
22 seconds...

774
01:55:50,145 --> 01:55:53,114
20 seconds, 19 seconds

775
01:55:53,415 --> 01:55:56,643
18 seconds, 17 seconds

776
01:55:57,386 --> 01:56:00,822
16 seconds, 15 seconds...

777
01:56:01,123 --> 01:56:03,057
14 seconds, 13 seconds

778
01:56:03,358 --> 01:56:06,694
12 seconds, 11 seconds

779
01:56:06,995 --> 01:56:08,289
10 seconds

780
01:56:08,931 --> 01:56:10,589
9 seconds

781
01:56:11,066 --> 01:56:12,997
8 seconds.

782
01:56:13,902 --> 01:56:16,027
- No!
- 7 seconds!

783
01:56:16,338 --> 01:56:17,370
6 seconds!

784
01:56:17,973 --> 01:56:19,165
5 seconds!

785
01:56:19,775 --> 01:56:20,864
4 seconds!

786
01:56:21,276 --> 01:56:22,502
3 seconds!

787
01:57:53,035 --> 01:57:54,397
Mr. Director...

788
01:57:55,304 --> 01:57:57,531
How about this?

789
01:58:01,510 --> 01:58:03,908
For example...

790
01:58:27,035 --> 01:58:28,898
You scumbags...

791
01:58:34,209 --> 01:58:36,209
I'll take revenge!

792
01:59:16,952 --> 01:59:18,644
I'm sorry

793
01:59:19,755 --> 01:59:23,154
I'm sorry; it can't be helped.

794
01:59:23,558 --> 01:59:26,422
I tried my best! You saw it all!

795
01:59:26,862 --> 01:59:28,830
Yes, you did!

796
01:59:29,131 --> 01:59:33,861
I have to do this for my wife, you know.

797
01:59:35,737 --> 01:59:38,362
I really love her.

798
01:59:39,141 --> 01:59:42,910
It's hard for a kid like you to understand.

799
01:59:43,211 --> 01:59:46,114
The world is filled with things
you can't get away from.

800
01:59:46,415 --> 01:59:49,109
No matter how hard you struggle...

801
01:59:49,651 --> 01:59:53,016
there are things
you're being forced to do.

802
01:59:56,358 --> 01:59:57,492
Dear...

803
01:59:57,793 --> 02:00:01,761
Alright, honey! Just wait a bit!
I'll take care of it!

804
02:00:02,798 --> 02:00:06,334
I'm sorry... really sorry...

805
02:00:08,503 --> 02:00:09,604
- I'm sorry...
- Ple... please!

806
02:00:09,704 --> 02:00:14,969
Don't rush me! I'm trying!
It'll be over soon!

807
02:00:17,779 --> 02:00:21,679
I'm sorry I shouted, honey;
you know I love you!

808
02:00:23,118 --> 02:00:26,988
I don't believe you have another man!
I don't care even if it's true!

809
02:00:27,289 --> 02:00:28,589
I'm going to forget it all.

810
02:00:28,890 --> 02:00:32,391
After all, I'm the head of the house.

811
02:00:33,995 --> 02:00:37,465
I must forget everything happened today

812
02:00:37,766 --> 02:00:39,600
I'll just think of it as a dream

813
02:00:39,901 --> 02:00:41,127
I love you, honey!

814
02:00:43,105 --> 02:00:49,343
I'm so sorry, kid! I'm truly sorry.

815
02:00:49,644 --> 02:00:51,302
Please forgive me.

816
02:00:51,746 --> 02:00:54,440
I love you, Mi-ran!

817
02:00:54,883 --> 02:00:58,619
Please forgive me, this grown-up...
this old man...

818
02:00:58,920 --> 02:01:04,925
Forgive me, you have to forgive me!

819
02:01:05,961 --> 02:01:10,327
Honey, I love you!

820
02:01:10,665 --> 02:01:18,365
Forgive me... I'm sorry, sorry!

821
02:01:22,577 --> 02:01:27,011
Forgive me...
