3
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,910
My ears hear what others cannot hear.

4
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:11,379
Small, faraway things people
cannot normally see are visible to me.

5
00:01:11,942 --> 00:01:15,755
These senses are the fruits
of a lifetime of longing.

6
00:01:16,248 --> 00:01:18,319
Longing to be rescued.

7
00:01:18,717 --> 00:01:19,889
To be completed.

8
00:01:21,386 --> 00:01:24,390
Just as the skirt needs the wind to billow...

9
00:01:24,556 --> 00:01:28,333
...I'm not formed by things
that are of myself alone.

10
00:01:28,493 --> 00:01:32,236
I wear my father's belt
tied around my mother's blouse.

11
00:01:33,466 --> 00:01:36,412
And shoes which are from my uncle.

12
00:01:38,336 --> 00:01:39,406
This is me.

13
00:01:43,976 --> 00:01:47,082
Just as a flower does not choose its color...

14
00:01:48,381 --> 00:01:51,362
...we are not responsible
for what we have come to be.

15
00:01:53,486 --> 00:01:56,729
Only once you realize this
do you become free.

16
00:01:57,256 --> 00:01:59,066
And to become adult...

17
00:01:59,726 --> 00:02:01,637
...is to become free.

18
00:03:41,698 --> 00:03:45,670
Richard! No!

19
00:03:52,576 --> 00:03:54,419
A family man...

20
00:03:54,578 --> 00:03:57,559
...devoted husband to his wife, Evelyn...

21
00:03:58,049 --> 00:04:01,292
...loving father to his daughter, India.

22
00:04:01,952 --> 00:04:04,990
He was a model to our town...

23
00:04:05,356 --> 00:04:08,930
...and of what it means to be a man
who walks through the world...

24
00:04:09,094 --> 00:04:13,439
...with openness, honesty and integrity.

25
00:04:15,533 --> 00:04:18,344
- India?
- Richard Stoker was taken from us...

26
00:04:18,503 --> 00:04:20,107
...by a cruel twist of fate.

27
00:04:20,272 --> 00:04:21,580
India?

28
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:25,449
The reasons for which
are unknown and unknowable.

29
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:29,080
By an accident
nobody would have predicted.

30
00:04:29,247 --> 00:04:32,694
It would have been impossible
for even an outstanding architect...

31
00:04:32,851 --> 00:04:34,353
...like Richard...

32
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:37,091
...to understand God's
great design.

33
00:04:48,568 --> 00:04:50,013
India?

34
00:04:52,539 --> 00:04:54,176
India.

35
00:04:57,677 --> 00:04:59,782
The guests will be here soon.

36
00:04:59,946 --> 00:05:02,723
Can you help
Mrs. McGarrick in the kitchen?

37
00:05:12,426 --> 00:05:13,461
Please?

38
00:05:16,764 --> 00:05:19,267
Don't do this to me, India.

39
00:05:19,433 --> 00:05:21,208
Not today.

40
00:05:34,181 --> 00:05:36,162
When they pried open his car...

41
00:05:36,317 --> 00:05:39,093
- ...you know, his body was burned...
- To a crisp.

42
00:05:39,254 --> 00:05:40,733
Terrible accident.

43
00:05:40,889 --> 00:05:42,994
Poor thing.
India was so close to her father.

44
00:05:43,158 --> 00:05:45,832
- Who's gonna look after her?
- She's still got her mother.

45
00:05:45,994 --> 00:05:49,134
- Her mother look after her?
Heh. More like the other way around.

46
00:05:49,297 --> 00:05:52,335
- You know what?
This whole accident is so strange.

47
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,021
Have you heard
all the rumors floating around...?

48
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,615
You don't think he meant
to drive off the bridge?

49
00:06:00,775 --> 00:06:03,256
- Why did he have to go two states away?
- I don't know.

50
00:06:03,412 --> 00:06:06,882
- Everything all right?
- Uh, yes, Mrs. McGarrick.

51
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:26,537
Now I'm wondering
if I kept them in the fridge too long.

52
00:06:26,702 --> 00:06:30,776
What do you think?
Was I too stingy with the paprika?

53
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:34,420
Mm? Ha, ha.

54
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:38,020
Your deviled eggs remind me
of when I was a little girl.

55
00:06:38,181 --> 00:06:43,654
Well, you may be all grown up,
but you still get eggshells all over the floor.

56
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,324
Have you outgrown your shoes?

57
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:54,469
Did you find your birthday present yet?

58
00:06:59,136 --> 00:07:01,241
I found the box, but it was empty.

59
00:07:01,739 --> 00:07:03,583
Are you sure?

60
00:07:03,742 --> 00:07:05,584
Did you check?

61
00:07:06,611 --> 00:07:08,318
Check again.

62
00:07:09,447 --> 00:07:13,555
Every year I thought it was my father
who left me shoes on my birthday.

63
00:07:14,386 --> 00:07:16,161
But all this time, it's been...

64
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:21,293
Tell me what it opens.

65
00:07:22,394 --> 00:07:23,498
How would I know?

66
00:07:25,664 --> 00:07:26,699
All right.

67
00:07:26,965 --> 00:07:28,309
That was my brother...

68
00:07:33,305 --> 00:07:37,186
You know, originally
they were part of a set of four...

69
00:07:37,343 --> 00:07:39,380
...but then I broke one as a kid.

70
00:07:39,545 --> 00:07:44,653
Now I'm seeing in this house
someone must have let another break.

71
00:07:44,816 --> 00:07:46,797
Unh. No, it wasn't me.

72
00:07:46,953 --> 00:07:50,799
When we, uh... When we moved in, it broke
as the housekeepers were unpacking it.

73
00:07:50,957 --> 00:07:52,334
- Ah.
- Mm-hm.

74
00:07:52,492 --> 00:07:55,963
India. Come and say hello
to your Uncle Charlie.

75
00:08:02,603 --> 00:08:05,482
India? Come over.

76
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,147
See you soon.

77
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:10,649
Hello, India.

78
00:08:13,547 --> 00:08:15,026
Come on.

79
00:08:17,418 --> 00:08:19,763
She hates to be touched. Heh.

80
00:08:19,921 --> 00:08:21,696
I'm her mother.

81
00:08:21,856 --> 00:08:23,698
What a curse, hm?

82
00:08:25,192 --> 00:08:27,331
You know, Charlie, Richard used to say...

83
00:08:27,494 --> 00:08:30,135
...that we had lost you
to the rest of the world forever.

84
00:08:30,298 --> 00:08:33,336
Why, India, you're white as a sheet.

85
00:08:33,868 --> 00:08:35,541
Is something wrong?

86
00:08:38,106 --> 00:08:39,483
Yes.

87
00:08:40,675 --> 00:08:41,983
My father is dead.

88
00:09:16,912 --> 00:09:18,823
How beautiful.

89
00:09:19,315 --> 00:09:24,197
Richard was so proud of India's hunting
that he stuffed every single thing she killed.

90
00:09:25,555 --> 00:09:28,161
What a tragic waste of life.

91
00:09:28,325 --> 00:09:30,566
These live particularly deep in the forest.

92
00:09:30,727 --> 00:09:33,264
They'd be very hard to catch.

93
00:09:35,532 --> 00:09:38,537
I guess Richard and India were a good team.

94
00:09:47,078 --> 00:09:49,024
Oh.

95
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:53,458
It's kind of disrespectful, him not
wearing black to his own brother's funeral.

96
00:09:53,618 --> 00:09:56,531
He must have come back today
from the Middle East or something.

97
00:09:56,687 --> 00:09:59,133
It's just part of a dig
in some old part of Istanbul?

98
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:02,794
- No, I think he was digging for
something quite different. Gold in Indonesia.

99
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,942
I really want to thank you
for your words this morning.

100
00:10:06,098 --> 00:10:09,306
- Well, you and Richard deserve every word.
- Oh.

101
00:10:39,499 --> 00:10:41,069
The wine's good.

102
00:11:07,761 --> 00:11:10,674
There you are. Come and join us.

103
00:11:10,865 --> 00:11:13,676
This is Richard's brother.

104
00:11:13,835 --> 00:11:14,869
Hello.

105
00:11:15,035 --> 00:11:16,378
- He's back.
- Nice to meet you.

106
00:11:16,537 --> 00:11:18,517
These are the Blooms,
good friends of ours.

107
00:11:18,672 --> 00:11:19,707
Good evening.

108
00:11:19,874 --> 00:11:21,716
I didn't know Richard had a brother.

109
00:11:21,743 --> 00:11:22,949
Nice to meet you.

110
00:11:23,111 --> 00:11:24,886
We're sorry for your loss.

111
00:11:25,046 --> 00:11:26,992
How did you know Richard?

112
00:11:32,888 --> 00:11:35,960
Got his doctorate from Oxford
when he was 24.

113
00:11:36,124 --> 00:11:37,524
Stoker sure had the brains.

114
00:11:37,659 --> 00:11:40,140
Yeah. Just look at India.

115
00:11:44,566 --> 00:11:45,601
Hello, again.

116
00:11:56,579 --> 00:11:59,788
Do you want to know why
you feel at a disadvantage right now?

117
00:12:01,417 --> 00:12:03,727
Because I didn't know
you existed until today?

118
00:12:04,353 --> 00:12:06,799
Because you're standing below me.

119
00:12:36,987 --> 00:12:39,058
You look like my father.

120
00:12:41,292 --> 00:12:43,533
I am so sorry.

121
00:12:44,729 --> 00:12:46,708
It's your loss too.

122
00:12:54,339 --> 00:12:56,250
Oh, um...

123
00:12:57,243 --> 00:12:59,654
In about 60 seconds,
your mother's gonna tell you...

124
00:12:59,811 --> 00:13:02,587
...that I'm gonna be
staying here for a while...

125
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:05,960
...but I want it to be your decision too.

126
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:08,594
Why?

127
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:12,133
Because...

128
00:13:13,324 --> 00:13:15,168
...it's important to me.

129
00:13:55,602 --> 00:13:57,947
This really is a beautiful garden.

130
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:02,312
The soil...

131
00:14:04,779 --> 00:14:06,349
...is so soft.

132
00:14:06,714 --> 00:14:08,387
Good for digging.

133
00:14:32,374 --> 00:14:35,480
I'm not exactly sure what you're driving at.

134
00:14:37,346 --> 00:14:39,326
I don't want any trouble.

135
00:14:39,481 --> 00:14:42,053
I am the only one
who would know anything about it.

136
00:14:42,218 --> 00:14:44,322
I did everything you asked of me.

137
00:14:44,486 --> 00:14:46,762
I kept you informed every year.

138
00:14:47,656 --> 00:14:52,265
I was your eyes, your ears,
your hands all this time.

139
00:14:52,428 --> 00:14:54,465
You're acting like you're in diapers now...

140
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:58,373
...and you've done this to me
ever since you were a child. I'm tired of it.

141
00:14:58,534 --> 00:15:00,241
- I am tired of it.
- All right.

142
00:15:12,348 --> 00:15:13,656
Mrs. McGarrick?

143
00:15:15,452 --> 00:15:17,363
Mrs. McGarrick?

144
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:23,271
Where is she?

145
00:15:23,427 --> 00:15:25,304
I haven't seen her yet.

146
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:27,907
Good morning.

147
00:15:31,735 --> 00:15:33,272
It's afternoon.

148
00:15:33,438 --> 00:15:36,442
Oh. I guess it is.

149
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:39,487
Do you think you could...?

150
00:15:41,246 --> 00:15:44,090
That's my girl. Thank you.

151
00:15:44,783 --> 00:15:46,194
Mm.

152
00:15:47,819 --> 00:15:49,822
What are you doing today?

153
00:15:51,289 --> 00:15:52,996
Thought I'd...

154
00:15:54,292 --> 00:15:56,272
...draw the curtains, stop the clocks...

155
00:15:56,428 --> 00:16:00,172
...cover the mirrors
and then retire to my room.

156
00:16:00,332 --> 00:16:02,312
Don't be morbid.

157
00:16:02,802 --> 00:16:04,906
Get rid of that dress. What is that?

158
00:16:05,503 --> 00:16:07,177
It's my mourning attire.

159
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,811
Why don't we get out of here, hm?

160
00:16:11,677 --> 00:16:13,953
Go shopping.
We could get some ice cream.

161
00:16:14,113 --> 00:16:18,186
In Victorian times, a widow was expected
to mourn her husband for two years.

162
00:16:19,018 --> 00:16:20,224
At least.

163
00:16:20,586 --> 00:16:22,293
- India.
- But in Ancient China...

164
00:16:22,455 --> 00:16:27,303
...they built a straw hut beside the grave
and lived there for three years doing nothing.

165
00:16:27,461 --> 00:16:31,067
You and me, ice cream, fresh air.

166
00:16:32,698 --> 00:16:35,145
Come on, all these years
of hunting trips with him...

167
00:16:35,302 --> 00:16:38,374
...and all I'm asking for
is one afternoon with me.

168
00:16:38,905 --> 00:16:41,442
That's what your father would have wanted.

169
00:16:44,845 --> 00:16:48,554
You know, your father and I
weren't always so distant.

170
00:16:50,016 --> 00:16:51,928
I miss when he was...

171
00:16:54,188 --> 00:16:55,724
...young.

172
00:19:11,364 --> 00:19:12,934
India!

173
00:19:16,035 --> 00:19:17,070
India!

174
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:38,398
Mature aroma.

175
00:19:38,725 --> 00:19:40,068
You chose a good year.

176
00:19:40,227 --> 00:19:42,070
You can't compare it to a younger wine.

177
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:44,435
Too tannic.

178
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:46,636
Not ready to be open.

179
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:50,111
You should have come with us, India.
Oh, the open top...

180
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:53,343
...the air. It felt so good.

181
00:19:53,508 --> 00:19:56,284
We stopped and Uncle Charlie
got some ice cream for you.

182
00:19:56,444 --> 00:19:59,391
One chocolate, one vanilla.

183
00:20:00,147 --> 00:20:01,252
Did I get it right?

184
00:20:02,183 --> 00:20:04,094
I like the swirl kind.

185
00:20:05,219 --> 00:20:08,496
Oh. You can make the swirl yourself,
you lazy thing.

186
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:10,734
Where's Mrs. McGarrick?

187
00:20:10,893 --> 00:20:12,236
She's still not here.

188
00:20:12,394 --> 00:20:14,600
What? What are we supposed to do?

189
00:20:15,663 --> 00:20:18,076
I'm not much in the kitchen.

190
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:20,344
I can cook a little.

191
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:22,772
No, you don't have to do that.

192
00:20:22,938 --> 00:20:24,349
I'd love to.

193
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:29,081
Charlie, who in the world are you?

194
00:20:31,513 --> 00:20:34,517
India, would you take these
down to the freezer, please?

195
00:20:38,121 --> 00:20:39,929
Do as your uncle tells you.

196
00:20:53,536 --> 00:20:55,106
- Thank you.
- Thank you, India.

197
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Hmun dang zawng aia tlawma

200
00:22:07,413 --> 00:22:09,324
Too cold down there?

201
00:22:12,518 --> 00:22:14,088
No.

202
00:22:32,873 --> 00:22:36,286
You know, there was a time...

203
00:22:36,476 --> 00:22:40,481
...Richard used to cook meals like this.
Ahem.

204
00:22:40,714 --> 00:22:42,716
Wasn't there, India?

205
00:22:43,116 --> 00:22:48,089
Oh. Phew. I'm sorry, of course.
That was before you were born.

206
00:22:50,958 --> 00:22:53,336
Where did you learn to cook like this,
Charlie?

207
00:22:54,162 --> 00:22:55,732
Madame Jacquin.

208
00:22:56,264 --> 00:23:00,906
She ran a Michelin-starred restaurant
outside of Toulouse called "L'Institution."

209
00:23:01,369 --> 00:23:04,407
- Hm. A female chef.
- Mm.

210
00:23:04,572 --> 00:23:07,815
In her opinion,
there was nothing a man could master...

211
00:23:07,976 --> 00:23:09,978
...that a woman couldn't make.

212
00:23:10,511 --> 00:23:11,820
What do you mean?

213
00:23:11,981 --> 00:23:14,518
It sounds better in French.

214
00:23:15,084 --> 00:23:19,156
Did I tell you on the way home?
Your French accent is perfect.

215
00:23:20,623 --> 00:23:24,366
One of the perks of a first-class education.
Heh.

216
00:23:24,526 --> 00:23:27,439
I could stay locked up in this house
for the rest of my life...

217
00:23:27,596 --> 00:23:31,442
...yet still speak impeccable French. Heh.

218
00:23:31,834 --> 00:23:35,407
I know you're not gonna spend
the rest of your life locked up in this house.

219
00:23:35,571 --> 00:23:38,951
How do you spend your days?
I want to know my brother's wife.

220
00:23:42,712 --> 00:23:45,385
Oh, I don't know where to start. Ha, ha.

221
00:23:46,116 --> 00:23:50,121
Charlie, you didn't even touch your food.

222
00:23:50,287 --> 00:23:52,961
Did you put poison
in the food just for us girls?

223
00:23:55,426 --> 00:23:57,132
But India ate everything.

224
00:23:59,062 --> 00:24:00,769
Practically licked it clean.

225
00:24:06,404 --> 00:24:07,849
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

226
00:24:08,005 --> 00:24:10,507
Now, can I get you anything else?

227
00:24:10,674 --> 00:24:13,485
Maybe some ice cream?

228
00:24:13,945 --> 00:24:15,356
No.

229
00:24:16,147 --> 00:24:18,058
"No, thank you."

230
00:24:19,517 --> 00:24:21,896
I mean, no, thank you.

231
00:24:25,222 --> 00:24:28,965
Would you like to
play something for us after dinner?

232
00:24:29,127 --> 00:24:30,902
I don't think so.

233
00:24:31,096 --> 00:24:32,131
Would you?

234
00:24:32,297 --> 00:24:33,970
India.

235
00:24:34,132 --> 00:24:36,202
I mean, no, thank you.

236
00:24:44,443 --> 00:24:46,354
Why didn't you tell me I had an uncle?

237
00:24:46,512 --> 00:24:50,186
Because I barely knew about Charlie myself.

238
00:24:50,349 --> 00:24:53,956
I mean, he's been traveling the world
for as long as I've known your father.

239
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:55,963
You know, he used to say to me:

240
00:24:56,489 --> 00:25:00,335
"What kind of family is family
that never comes home?"

241
00:25:02,095 --> 00:25:05,042
Let's stop talking about Richard. Excuse me.

242
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,907
I'm sorry.

243
00:25:44,538 --> 00:25:46,882
1994.

244
00:25:50,845 --> 00:25:52,882
The year you were born.

245
00:26:28,851 --> 00:26:30,695
What do you want from me?

246
00:26:31,088 --> 00:26:32,567
To be friends.

247
00:26:41,665 --> 00:26:44,043
We don't need to be friends.

248
00:26:47,604 --> 00:26:49,311
We're family.

249
00:26:50,874 --> 00:26:53,650
It takes time to observe attentively.

250
00:26:54,611 --> 00:26:57,218
Wait for the moment that our eyes...

251
00:26:57,381 --> 00:27:00,385
...finally penetrate the inside of the subject.

252
00:27:00,551 --> 00:27:01,961
Look, Marv...

253
00:27:02,119 --> 00:27:04,326
...see that flower?
The way it just hangs there?

254
00:27:04,488 --> 00:27:06,435
My eyes are penetrating
the inside of you.

255
00:27:06,591 --> 00:27:10,835
Observe carefully
and you'll note that this plant...

256
00:27:14,465 --> 00:27:16,138
Check out Pitts.

257
00:27:17,335 --> 00:27:18,973
I want you to really...

258
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:20,639
Hey.

259
00:27:24,176 --> 00:27:27,054
- Pitts.
- Yes, Mr. Feldman?

260
00:27:28,379 --> 00:27:31,340
Is there something you'd
like to share with the rest of the class?

261
00:27:31,383 --> 00:27:33,488
Yeah, I've got something I'd like to share.

262
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,598
With India.

263
00:27:55,774 --> 00:27:57,516
He's gorgeous.

264
00:28:24,004 --> 00:28:25,142
Hey.

265
00:28:28,576 --> 00:28:30,283
Come back.

266
00:28:52,133 --> 00:28:53,476
Mom?

267
00:29:19,395 --> 00:29:21,170
It's going to rain.

268
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:51,803
Mm. Relax.

269
00:29:53,297 --> 00:29:54,742
There.

270
00:29:58,736 --> 00:30:00,238
Curl your fingers.

271
00:30:02,707 --> 00:30:04,084
No.

272
00:30:04,242 --> 00:30:06,118
Watch me. You see?

273
00:30:09,847 --> 00:30:11,190
Oh.

274
00:30:11,349 --> 00:30:13,192
I'm teaching him piano.

275
00:30:13,351 --> 00:30:15,696
Uncle Charlie is a complete beginner.

276
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:19,066
Put on some dry clothes
and come play with us.

277
00:30:19,223 --> 00:30:24,173
Why don't you take a hot shower first
or you'll catch a cold. Come on. Here.

278
00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:29,601
Good morning, sweetie.

279
00:30:30,336 --> 00:30:33,044
Charlie cleared off the court yesterday.

280
00:30:33,205 --> 00:30:35,412
So we're just gonna walk on over.

281
00:30:36,275 --> 00:30:38,482
You don't want to come, do you?

282
00:30:38,644 --> 00:30:40,351
Hello, India.

283
00:30:41,213 --> 00:30:43,387
I took one of Richard's belts.

284
00:30:43,717 --> 00:30:46,390
- His whites are a little big.
- Mm.

285
00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:47,954
Ready?

286
00:30:48,554 --> 00:30:49,589
Let's go.

287
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:00,973
India?

288
00:31:01,468 --> 00:31:02,845
Oh.

289
00:31:03,002 --> 00:31:04,640
It's me.

290
00:31:04,804 --> 00:31:07,684
Come and give your Auntie Gin a hug.

291
00:31:17,251 --> 00:31:20,892
- What time did you get in, Gwendolyn?
- Around 4.

292
00:31:21,055 --> 00:31:23,501
Mm. That's right.

293
00:31:25,025 --> 00:31:26,129
And when do you fly out?

294
00:31:28,396 --> 00:31:31,002
That remains to be seen.

295
00:31:31,499 --> 00:31:34,037
I'd originally planned
to stay for only a day or two...

296
00:31:34,202 --> 00:31:37,978
...but now I'm thinking
I should stay a bit longer.

297
00:31:38,139 --> 00:31:40,380
Spend a little quality time with India.

298
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:44,119
Hm. How nice for her.

299
00:31:46,314 --> 00:31:48,521
- Charles?
- Auntie Gin.

300
00:31:48,683 --> 00:31:50,457
How long have you been here?

301
00:31:51,286 --> 00:31:52,788
Not long.

302
00:31:52,954 --> 00:31:57,164
We're so grateful that he's taken time away
from his commitments in Europe.

303
00:31:58,226 --> 00:32:00,173
- Europe?
- Yes.

304
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:20,490
Evie, dear, after dinner,
I was thinking perhaps you and I could talk.

305
00:32:21,117 --> 00:32:22,994
- We are talking.
- Alone.

306
00:32:23,152 --> 00:32:25,997
- About what?
- Like Richard, for instance.

307
00:32:26,156 --> 00:32:28,295
- Richard?
- Yes, Evie. Richard.

308
00:32:28,459 --> 00:32:30,199
My nephew, your late husband.

309
00:32:30,359 --> 00:32:32,737
I don't think I'll be forgetting his name
any time soon.

310
00:32:32,895 --> 00:32:38,676
Of course not. I just thought
there might be arrangements to be made.

311
00:32:39,303 --> 00:32:41,340
Things to be settled.

312
00:32:41,505 --> 00:32:46,045
Our lawyer has said none of this has anything
to do with you. You're not in the will.

313
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:49,589
No, dear, I mean something entirely different.

314
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:52,388
Like, for example...

315
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:57,362
...maybe we could talk about
your living here with Charlie like this.

316
00:32:59,958 --> 00:33:04,134
Auntie Gin isn't shy when it comes
to expressing her opinions about me.

317
00:33:04,295 --> 00:33:07,765
Like when Richard asked me to marry him.
What Auntie Gin might be surprised...

318
00:33:07,932 --> 00:33:11,709
...to learn is that those opinions
are neither wanted, needed, or appreciated.

319
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:14,214
- Evie...
- You come into my home and attack me...

320
00:33:14,372 --> 00:33:16,374
...at a time like this.

321
00:33:16,541 --> 00:33:18,078
Evie...

322
00:33:24,415 --> 00:33:27,590
I'm sure Auntie Gin didn't mean anything.

323
00:33:27,953 --> 00:33:29,899
You didn't mean anything by it, did you?

324
00:33:30,055 --> 00:33:31,625
No.

325
00:33:32,358 --> 00:33:35,271
No, of course not, Evie dear.

326
00:33:35,794 --> 00:33:40,334
Now, would either of you two
like to play something for us after dinner?

327
00:33:41,166 --> 00:33:42,839
No, thank you.

328
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:47,716
Good night, Auntie Gin.

329
00:33:48,741 --> 00:33:51,723
Don't mind Evie. She’s just tired. Oh, um...

330
00:33:51,878 --> 00:33:54,119
What was the name of your hotel again?

331
00:33:55,382 --> 00:33:58,852
- The Biltmore.
- The Biltmore.

332
00:34:00,688 --> 00:34:02,860
Maybe we could have breakfast together.

333
00:34:03,023 --> 00:34:04,730
- Just us girls.
- Oh, I'm not sure.

334
00:34:04,891 --> 00:34:06,495
Can you take her to the Biltmore Hotel?

335
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:09,073
I'll probably have a headache in the morning.

336
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:12,973
- Drive carefully.
- Auntie Gin, stay the night here.

337
00:34:13,501 --> 00:34:15,002
Oh.

338
00:34:17,304 --> 00:34:18,943
You made the evening much nicer.

339
00:34:19,106 --> 00:34:21,450
Oh, thank you, dear.

340
00:34:21,609 --> 00:34:27,322
But an old woman needs time on her own
to recover. Good night, sweet child.

341
00:34:28,983 --> 00:34:30,758
Call me.

342
00:34:39,628 --> 00:34:43,165
Are there any other hotels in town
besides the Biltmore?

343
00:34:43,431 --> 00:34:47,972
Even family ties
have no meaning when food is scarce.

344
00:34:48,136 --> 00:34:52,643
This one knows there is no room
for his brother in the hunt.

345
00:34:52,809 --> 00:34:58,815
While this sibling rivalry may seem cruel,
in the end, it is for the best.

346
00:34:59,781 --> 00:35:03,389
Each day in the hunt
brings the eagle closer to maturity.

347
00:35:09,659 --> 00:35:10,865
...and chicks of his own.

348
00:35:11,027 --> 00:35:15,305
The most patient of predators,
the black eagle can circle for hours...

349
00:35:15,465 --> 00:35:18,538
...waiting for the perfect moment to strike.

350
00:35:18,702 --> 00:35:23,514
The fish will provide much needed
nourishment for her growing chicks.

351
00:35:40,824 --> 00:35:43,998
I was wondering
if anyone had turned in a cell phone.

352
00:35:44,161 --> 00:35:48,507
I think I may have dropped it
when I was checking in.

353
00:35:49,166 --> 00:35:51,806
Are you absolutely certain?

354
00:35:52,403 --> 00:35:59,413
All right. Oh, wait, wait. Um,
what number do I have to press to dial out?

355
00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:02,587
Nine. Yes, I thought so.

356
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:05,316
Oh. Come on.

357
00:37:05,846 --> 00:37:08,656
The mountains
are no place for the faint of heart.

358
00:37:08,815 --> 00:37:12,286
The steep terrain and harsh climate
make a challenging climate...

359
00:37:12,453 --> 00:37:14,364
...for even the strongest of species.

360
00:37:23,264 --> 00:37:24,504
...wings are freedom.

361
00:37:26,834 --> 00:37:30,681
...while the eagle prefers to find its own meals,
there is nothing wrong in having a little help.

362
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:36,679
Any advantage in nature is to be appreciated,
and what the left...

363
00:37:39,181 --> 00:37:43,994
...a hearty meal for the hungry bird
who lived to hunt another day.

364
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:08,649
...thirteen pounds
and a wingspan of nearly 7 feet.

365
00:38:23,761 --> 00:38:26,764
You said you were staying
at the Biltmore Hotel...

366
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:28,968
...and yet, here you are.

367
00:38:30,501 --> 00:38:32,242
I even had to call the cab company.

368
00:38:41,879 --> 00:38:45,122
...prey does hot suspect
the hunter is circling high above...

369
00:38:45,984 --> 00:38:48,555
...and is taken completely by surprise.

370
00:38:55,827 --> 00:38:57,829
Oh.

371
00:39:38,105 --> 00:39:41,814
- Hey, yo, yo. Look who's here.
- No kidding?

372
00:39:41,975 --> 00:39:45,012
- Is it...? Is it true?
- Is it?

373
00:39:51,485 --> 00:39:52,566
Yo, check this out.

374
00:39:53,186 --> 00:39:55,987
- I'm telling you, she can talk, bro.
- Well, let's find out.

375
00:39:56,057 --> 00:39:58,559
- Oh, creepy, man.
- All right, shh, shh.

376
00:39:58,725 --> 00:40:00,534
Hey, Stoker.

377
00:40:03,363 --> 00:40:07,608
- Uh-oh. Ooh.
- Mm-mm.

378
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:11,581
- Hey, Stoker.
- Where you going?

379
00:40:11,738 --> 00:40:13,650
I'm talking to you.

380
00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:17,390
Or do you go by Stroker now?

381
00:40:17,545 --> 00:40:20,151
Because I hear
that's what your mom's been doing...

382
00:40:20,315 --> 00:40:21,659
...to your uncle.

383
00:40:23,584 --> 00:40:25,586
You been getting in on that?

384
00:40:27,956 --> 00:40:29,799
- What did you say?
- Ooh!

385
00:40:29,959 --> 00:40:32,906
- She speaks.
- "What did you say?"

386
00:40:34,196 --> 00:40:36,300
I think you heard me, Stroker.

387
00:40:36,764 --> 00:40:37,936
Say that again?

388
00:40:38,099 --> 00:40:40,910
- Uh-oh.
- Oh!

389
00:40:41,337 --> 00:40:45,308
All right. I think you'd better
watch your step, Stroker.

390
00:40:45,507 --> 00:40:48,045
You know what happens
to little girls who mess with me?

391
00:40:49,178 --> 00:40:51,055
Watch this.

392
00:40:54,683 --> 00:40:55,753
What's up, bitch?

393
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:59,430
- What's up?
- Ooh.

394
00:41:10,533 --> 00:41:12,535
- Hey, come here, you all right?
- Oh, my God.

395
00:41:12,702 --> 00:41:14,205
You okay?

396
00:41:14,505 --> 00:41:17,451
All right, Pitts. That's enough.

397
00:41:17,607 --> 00:41:18,745
Get out of here, Whip.

398
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:22,924
Follow the bouncing ball, jackass.

399
00:41:23,247 --> 00:41:25,625
She's not interested.

400
00:41:27,952 --> 00:41:29,157
Dude, let's just go.

401
00:41:30,521 --> 00:41:33,934
Yeah, like I enjoy wasting my time
on this bitch, anyways. Let's go.

402
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:37,203
- Freak.
- Sorry about that.

403
00:41:37,361 --> 00:41:39,433
He's an A-hole, okay? Just ignore him.

404
00:41:41,766 --> 00:41:43,211
Hey.

405
00:41:43,634 --> 00:41:45,409
Where you going?

406
00:42:14,167 --> 00:42:15,840
Too cold down there?

407
00:42:24,911 --> 00:42:28,017
India, would you take these down
to the freezer, please?

408
00:46:40,409 --> 00:46:44,357
That I had only sang to just a few

409
00:46:45,748 --> 00:46:51,495
She saw my silver spurs
And said let's pass some time

410
00:46:52,522 --> 00:46:58,403
And I will give to you
Summer wine

411
00:46:59,128 --> 00:47:04,010
Oh, summer wine

412
00:47:06,236 --> 00:47:12,778
Strawberries, cherries
And an angel's kiss in spring

413
00:47:13,110 --> 00:47:19,084
My summer wine is really
Made from all these things

414
00:47:19,350 --> 00:47:22,297
You stayed longer than I thought you would.

415
00:47:25,055 --> 00:47:27,036
You probably need to move on.

416
00:47:27,191 --> 00:47:32,504
And I will give to you
Summer wine

417
00:47:35,434 --> 00:47:37,504
You want me to leave?

418
00:47:40,405 --> 00:47:42,613
My eyes grew heavy

419
00:47:42,775 --> 00:47:43,810
Come on.

420
00:47:44,877 --> 00:47:47,357
You could return to Madame Jacquin.

421
00:47:49,614 --> 00:47:52,755
But I couldn't find my feet

422
00:47:53,919 --> 00:47:58,425
She reassured me
With an unfamiliar line

423
00:47:58,590 --> 00:47:59,660
Dance with me.

424
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,836
And then she gave to me

425
00:48:02,995 --> 00:48:04,872
I always end up leading.

426
00:48:06,799 --> 00:48:08,039
Well then, lead me, Evie.

427
00:48:14,274 --> 00:48:20,623
Strawberries, cherries
And an angel's kiss in spring

428
00:48:21,147 --> 00:48:26,257
My summer wine is really
Made from all these things

429
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:27,922
You know...

430
00:48:28,889 --> 00:48:29,992
...for me...

431
00:48:30,857 --> 00:48:33,565
...it doesn't matter who you are.

432
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:36,571
I feel the same.

433
00:48:38,766 --> 00:48:41,474
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

434
00:48:42,535 --> 00:48:44,914
It doesn't matter who I am for me, either.

435
00:48:48,676 --> 00:48:54,252
When I woke up
The sun was shining in my eyes

436
00:48:55,449 --> 00:49:01,457
My silver spurs were gone
My head felt twice its size

437
00:49:02,224 --> 00:49:08,106
She took my silver spurs
A dollar and a dime

438
00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:14,981
And left me cravin' for
More summer wine

439
00:49:15,670 --> 00:49:20,416
Oh, summer wine

440
00:49:35,992 --> 00:49:41,135
Oh, summer wine

441
00:49:54,411 --> 00:49:55,446
Whip.

442
00:50:00,217 --> 00:50:01,719
Hey.

443
00:50:02,686 --> 00:50:04,529
I just thought I...

444
00:50:05,923 --> 00:50:07,994
I've never been here before.

445
00:50:08,725 --> 00:50:10,569
Yeah, no kidding.

446
00:50:12,697 --> 00:50:15,267
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

447
00:50:15,499 --> 00:50:17,274
Have fun, bro.

448
00:50:29,047 --> 00:50:30,287
So...

449
00:50:31,716 --> 00:50:33,525
You wanna go inside?

450
00:50:37,122 --> 00:50:39,693
Then where would you like to go?

451
00:50:48,033 --> 00:50:52,209
India Stoker,
Middlebend straight-A student...

452
00:50:52,371 --> 00:50:55,648
...hanging out in the parking lot at Rockets?

453
00:50:55,808 --> 00:50:57,947
Doesn't really seem like you.

454
00:50:58,711 --> 00:51:00,816
Not that you would know.

455
00:51:02,382 --> 00:51:06,830
Well, I... I guess you're right. I wouldn't.

456
00:51:07,653 --> 00:51:09,724
It's just that, um...

457
00:51:10,089 --> 00:51:11,535
Yes.

458
00:51:12,425 --> 00:51:14,302
I know what you mean.

459
00:51:15,328 --> 00:51:16,739
Oh. yeah?

460
00:51:17,697 --> 00:51:19,268
How's that?

461
00:51:24,270 --> 00:51:26,409
Have you ever seen
a photograph of yourself...

462
00:51:27,407 --> 00:51:30,821
...taken when you didn't know
you're being photographed?

463
00:51:32,113 --> 00:51:35,525
From an angle you don't get to see
when you look in the mirror.

464
00:51:36,617 --> 00:51:39,325
And you think, "That's me.

465
00:51:40,154 --> 00:51:42,828
That's also me."

466
00:51:43,090 --> 00:51:44,467
Do you...?

467
00:51:45,227 --> 00:51:47,604
Do you know what I'm talking about?

468
00:51:49,130 --> 00:51:52,077
Yeah. I think I do.

469
00:51:58,807 --> 00:52:00,479
Well...

470
00:52:00,641 --> 00:52:02,952
...that's how I feel tonight.

471
00:52:04,646 --> 00:52:07,354
So you're surprised at yourself?

472
00:52:16,658 --> 00:52:19,868
You're not afraid of being touched anymore?

473
00:52:22,231 --> 00:52:24,336
Please don't spoil it.

474
00:53:11,281 --> 00:53:13,353
Holy shit.

475
00:53:13,718 --> 00:53:15,527
Everyone said you were crazy.

476
00:53:16,287 --> 00:53:19,028
But they have no idea, do they?

477
00:53:19,189 --> 00:53:21,329
I wanna go home now.

478
00:53:21,826 --> 00:53:23,499
Let me go.

479
00:53:23,661 --> 00:53:25,140
No, you don't.

480
00:53:25,296 --> 00:53:29,109
You opened this door,
and now you're gonna walk through it.

481
00:53:34,939 --> 00:53:36,282
- Shh!
- Oh...

482
00:53:36,441 --> 00:53:38,149
Quiet.

483
00:53:38,944 --> 00:53:40,719
Hold still.

484
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:43,360
This is not gonna hurt.

485
00:53:43,983 --> 00:53:45,427
Shit, what...?

486
00:53:45,583 --> 00:53:47,393
Unh! Ow! Oh, ow!

487
00:53:47,553 --> 00:53:48,930
Stop, stop, stop.

488
00:53:49,088 --> 00:53:51,329
I broke my... Ow.

489
00:53:51,490 --> 00:53:54,664
Glad I borrowed your dad's belt.
Mine would've been way too short.

490
00:53:54,828 --> 00:53:57,899
- Ow. Shit...
- All yours.

491
00:53:58,063 --> 00:54:01,510
- I'm seriously hurt. Shit.
- Shut up.

492
00:54:20,955 --> 00:54:24,026
Ow. Ow!

493
00:54:24,191 --> 00:54:27,195
India, stop. Ow. Ow.

494
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:29,534
India. Ow. Unh!

495
00:54:29,697 --> 00:54:31,836
Stop. Stop.

496
00:56:06,431 --> 00:56:09,502
INDIA: Aah. Unh!
- I'll kill you.

497
00:56:12,569 --> 00:56:14,311
I don't give a fuck...

498
00:59:22,968 --> 00:59:24,607
Strawberries, cherries

499
00:59:26,938 --> 00:59:28,645
Yes?

500
00:59:33,679 --> 00:59:35,249
Can I come in?

501
00:59:38,518 --> 00:59:40,497
Well, what time is it?

502
00:59:55,268 --> 00:59:57,407
Would you brush my hair?

503
00:59:59,239 --> 01:00:01,583
I was just going to bed.

504
01:00:04,978 --> 01:00:07,288
Then I'll brush yours.

505
01:00:11,009 --> 01:00:14,218
You're wearing the nightgown I bought you.

506
01:00:18,651 --> 01:00:22,154
Tonight I felt like wearing something silk.

507
01:00:22,587 --> 01:00:26,502
Now that I think about it,
I never brushed your hair...

508
01:00:27,026 --> 01:00:28,733
...did I?

509
01:00:29,195 --> 01:00:30,572
You were busy.

510
01:00:33,766 --> 01:00:34,904
With what?

511
01:00:36,035 --> 01:00:37,139
I don't know.

512
01:00:38,137 --> 01:00:40,617
You and your father
were always on your hunting trips.

513
01:00:40,773 --> 01:00:45,620
How could I compete with all of those
dead birds you constantly brought home?

514
01:00:45,778 --> 01:00:50,022
She reassured me
With an unfamiliar-

515
01:01:00,127 --> 01:01:02,266
I saw you in the dining room today.

516
01:01:03,630 --> 01:01:06,133
I don't know what you think you saw...

517
01:01:07,969 --> 01:01:10,347
...but nothing happened.

518
01:01:12,272 --> 01:01:15,617
You were so still,
I never even heard you there.

519
01:01:15,776 --> 01:01:18,018
Dad taught me that.

520
01:01:20,148 --> 01:01:21,684
Hunting.

521
01:01:25,153 --> 01:01:27,030
To wait.

522
01:01:30,358 --> 01:01:32,599
In silence.

523
01:01:37,433 --> 01:01:39,878
We wouldn't need food or drink.

524
01:01:41,035 --> 01:01:43,073
We would watch everything.

525
01:01:44,072 --> 01:01:47,383
The patterns of tree branches
spreading out...

526
01:01:48,510 --> 01:01:51,821
...the thousands of shapes clouds make.

527
01:01:52,714 --> 01:01:55,991
I could count the number of leaves on a tree
in five hours.

528
01:02:02,225 --> 01:02:05,364
I always thought Dad liked hunting.

529
01:02:05,561 --> 01:02:07,438
But tonight I realized he did it for me.

530
01:02:09,866 --> 01:02:13,006
He used to say, "Sometimes
you need to do something bad...

531
01:02:13,169 --> 01:02:16,309
...to stop you from doing something worse."

532
01:02:33,823 --> 01:02:38,136
Tomorrow, I'm gonna go
to the hairdresser...

533
01:02:38,295 --> 01:02:41,435
...after I clean out your father's study.

534
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:10,000

537
01:05:20,665 --> 01:05:22,644
Dear India, happy birthday.

538
01:05:22,799 --> 01:05:26,076
You are 5 years old today.
I wish I could be there for your party...

539
01:05:26,236 --> 01:05:29,616
...but your uncle is far away in Africa
taking pictures for the magazine.

540
01:05:29,774 --> 01:05:32,550
Dearest India, I'm writing this letter to you
from Florence.

541
01:05:32,710 --> 01:05:36,055
Yesterday, I circled Michelangelo's David
for hours. He carries a sling.

542
01:05:36,213 --> 01:05:38,420
His belted weapon over his left shoulder.

543
01:05:38,582 --> 01:05:41,995
- You are my dearest and only niece.
- My silent and invisible partner.

544
01:05:42,153 --> 01:05:45,101
And these are the lessons for you
in our many chapters together.

545
01:05:45,257 --> 01:05:46,861
- Dear India.
- Happy birthday again.

546
01:05:47,025 --> 01:05:48,901
I've missed your first teeth coming out.

547
01:05:49,060 --> 01:05:51,131
I'll never see the holes in your smile...

548
01:05:51,295 --> 01:05:53,656
...or how they will fill in
as you mature into a young lady.

549
01:05:53,799 --> 01:05:55,720
Greetings from
Saint-Ètienne, where

550
01:05:55,746 --> 01:05:57,795
everyone I meet insists
on kissing both cheeks.

551
01:05:57,936 --> 01:05:59,438
This custom of hugging and kissing.

552
01:05:59,604 --> 01:06:01,948
I think you, too, would find this uncomfortable.

553
01:06:02,107 --> 01:06:05,020
If I found it was you in an embrace,
I could make an exception.

554
01:06:05,177 --> 01:06:07,384
- I wonder if you would, too.
- Happy Valentine's.

555
01:06:07,546 --> 01:06:09,150
- Happy Halloween.
- Merry Christmas.

556
01:06:09,314 --> 01:06:12,592
- Though I never receive a letter...
- I see your messages in the stars.

557
01:06:12,752 --> 01:06:14,031
Or in the music I hear.

558
01:06:14,186 --> 01:06:18,157
It is a whistling tune from a lonely man
wandering in a foreign land.

559
01:06:18,323 --> 01:06:21,271
I sense things so acutely
until it becomes almost too much.

560
01:06:21,427 --> 01:06:23,964
I wonder if for you, too,
life is made difficult by...

561
01:06:24,130 --> 01:06:27,873
The fact that you can hear what others
cannot hear, see what they cannot see.

562
01:06:28,034 --> 01:06:31,504
I know that someday you'll be
very special, India, and you already are.

563
01:06:31,671 --> 01:06:35,118
- I know inside you feel some loneliness.
- Because you are the only one.

564
01:06:35,274 --> 01:06:39,121
Please know that I am
with you as we share the same blood.

565
01:06:39,279 --> 01:06:41,849
Tonight, I'll fall asleep as I try to imagine...

566
01:06:42,014 --> 01:06:45,018
...that you'll grow up and take over our name.

567
01:06:46,153 --> 01:06:47,689
How I want to meet you.

568
01:06:47,855 --> 01:06:51,701
- All my love, Charlie.
- All my love, Charlie.

569
01:08:12,943 --> 01:08:16,288
MAN: You've reached the Middlebend
Sheriff's Department non-emergency number.

570
01:08:16,446 --> 01:08:20,554
If this is an emergency,
please hang up and dial 911.

571
01:08:20,718 --> 01:08:24,894
Otherwise, please hold
for the next available operator.

572
01:08:27,490 --> 01:08:30,665
Middlebend Sheriff's Department,
how may I help you?

573
01:08:31,195 --> 01:08:32,640
Hello?

574
01:08:32,797 --> 01:08:34,367
Hello?

575
01:08:34,532 --> 01:08:36,170
Hello?

576
01:08:45,276 --> 01:08:48,952
My father had the exact same sunglasses.

577
01:08:54,552 --> 01:08:58,899
He wore them only when he was driving
so they were always in the glove compartment.

578
01:09:00,659 --> 01:09:04,335
Now I suppose they're all melted up,
along with the rest of the car.

579
01:09:05,163 --> 01:09:07,370
Please leave before my mother wakes up.

580
01:09:09,234 --> 01:09:12,307
Aren't you curious
about what happened to Richard?

581
01:09:14,474 --> 01:09:17,045
I'm curious
about what happened to Jonathan.

582
01:09:22,181 --> 01:09:25,651
That's an inseparable part
of what happened to Richard.

583
01:09:25,818 --> 01:09:30,199
Richard was completely taken with Jonathan.

584
01:09:30,357 --> 01:09:34,998
That summer, Jonathan had just learned
how to climb the stairs.

585
01:09:35,161 --> 01:09:36,538
Let's go again. Let's go.

586
01:09:36,696 --> 01:09:40,509
He couldn't resist climbing
any staircase he came across.

587
01:10:54,143 --> 01:10:58,251
It's been 20 years since your family
donated this building to Crawford.

588
01:10:58,415 --> 01:11:01,988
It may look old now,
but Charlie's room is still very comfortable.

589
01:11:02,753 --> 01:11:06,030
As you know,
he was the one who wanted to stay here.

590
01:11:06,189 --> 01:11:09,398
And he insisted on being discharged
on this day.

591
01:11:09,559 --> 01:11:11,232
Today.

592
01:11:12,729 --> 01:11:13,800
Welcome to my home.

593
01:11:17,100 --> 01:11:19,011
Away from home.

594
01:11:35,686 --> 01:11:37,791
Until we meet again.

595
01:11:47,865 --> 01:11:49,504
I'm so proud of you.

596
01:12:25,338 --> 01:12:28,012
It always was your favorite car.

597
01:12:31,679 --> 01:12:35,149
I think you're gonna love New York.

598
01:12:35,682 --> 01:12:37,389
I got you your own apartment.

599
01:12:39,686 --> 01:12:41,098
You see?

600
01:12:42,556 --> 01:12:44,763
Aren't we going to your house?

601
01:12:45,726 --> 01:12:48,002
Everything you need is in here.

602
01:12:50,431 --> 01:12:52,035
Why aren't we going to your place?

603
01:12:56,604 --> 01:12:58,050
I'm not gonna see India?

604
01:12:58,206 --> 01:12:59,327
Here are the keys.

605
01:12:59,407 --> 01:13:02,114
I think you'll see that I've taken care of
all the details.

606
01:13:03,043 --> 01:13:04,523
Why are you doing this to me?

607
01:13:04,545 --> 01:13:08,619
Do I really have to tell you something
you already know?

608
01:13:08,884 --> 01:13:10,659
Why can't I go?

609
01:13:10,819 --> 01:13:12,696
Charlie.

610
01:13:12,854 --> 01:13:14,492
Why not?

611
01:13:19,728 --> 01:13:21,469
Tell me.

612
01:13:23,866 --> 01:13:25,174
You listen very carefully.

613
01:13:25,334 --> 01:13:27,541
This is the most important thing.

614
01:13:28,270 --> 01:13:32,583
- If anything happens, you must call...
- You still love me, don't you, Richie?

615
01:13:34,477 --> 01:13:37,947
Yes, of course, I love you, Charlie.

616
01:13:40,651 --> 01:13:45,326
I just have to love you a little less now.
I can't have you...

617
01:13:45,488 --> 01:13:49,095
Near my India, my family.

618
01:13:49,259 --> 01:13:50,397
And I said:

619
01:13:51,128 --> 01:13:53,267
But I'm your family.

620
01:13:55,331 --> 01:13:58,404
What kind of family
is family you can't take home?

621
01:13:59,169 --> 01:14:01,274
- Jesus.
- Excuse me.

622
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:06,114
Jesus, Charlie.

623
01:14:30,902 --> 01:14:32,644
Are you okay?

624
01:14:34,138 --> 01:14:36,243
I'm fine, Richie.

625
01:14:37,575 --> 01:14:38,815
I'm fine now.

626
01:14:41,113 --> 01:14:42,456
Thank you for asking.

627
01:14:58,531 --> 01:14:59,566
Charlie?

628
01:15:02,001 --> 01:15:04,072
Unh. Oh, Charlie.

629
01:15:17,117 --> 01:15:19,825
Of course, I still love you, Richard.

630
01:15:21,187 --> 01:15:24,431
I just have to love you a little bit less now.

631
01:15:39,973 --> 01:15:41,885
Why now?

632
01:15:43,978 --> 01:15:45,389
Why come back now?

633
01:15:54,388 --> 01:15:56,561
The day I left Crawford...

634
01:15:57,158 --> 01:15:59,139
...the day your father had his accident...

635
01:15:59,661 --> 01:16:02,005
...what day was it, do you remember?

636
01:16:02,197 --> 01:16:03,733
Yes.

637
01:16:05,367 --> 01:16:06,970
I remember.

638
01:16:07,601 --> 01:16:08,945
What day was it?

639
01:16:11,473 --> 01:16:14,249
It was my 18th birthday.

640
01:16:24,086 --> 01:16:25,225
I was waiting.

641
01:16:26,322 --> 01:16:27,926
For you.

642
01:16:28,424 --> 01:16:29,801
Everything I've ever done.

643
01:16:31,894 --> 01:16:33,463
For you, India.

644
01:18:05,491 --> 01:18:07,869
Happy birthday, India.

645
01:18:16,002 --> 01:18:17,640
Yes, sheriff.

646
01:18:17,804 --> 01:18:21,513
I was hungry,
so I stopped by Rockets for some fries.

647
01:18:21,675 --> 01:18:26,523
I bumped into Whip at the parking lot
and we decided to go for a walk.

648
01:18:26,681 --> 01:18:29,628
At night? Those woods are dangerous.

649
01:18:29,784 --> 01:18:31,888
Oh, I wasn't scared.

650
01:18:32,052 --> 01:18:34,191
Not with Whip there.

651
01:18:34,956 --> 01:18:36,958
He's so strong.

652
01:18:38,059 --> 01:18:39,561
I see.

653
01:18:41,596 --> 01:18:46,341
So we had a very nice time.

654
01:18:49,637 --> 01:18:51,207
And then?

655
01:18:51,572 --> 01:18:54,076
And then I went home.

656
01:18:54,977 --> 01:18:57,456
I thought Whip said
he was heading home too.

657
01:18:57,612 --> 01:19:00,024
Any idea what time that was?

658
01:19:00,581 --> 01:19:02,619
Well, that was, uh...

659
01:19:03,986 --> 01:19:05,988
When did you eat the fries?

660
01:19:07,990 --> 01:19:09,094
Excuse me?

661
01:19:09,258 --> 01:19:12,364
Well, you said you went there
because you were hungry? Uh...

662
01:19:12,528 --> 01:19:19,276
And then, that is, after having a nice time,
you would have become even more hungry...

663
01:19:20,336 --> 01:19:22,975
...and if you went to eat some fries...

664
01:19:23,138 --> 01:19:27,144
...I could find some people that can remember
what time they saw you.

665
01:19:28,344 --> 01:19:30,085
I think I, um..

666
01:19:30,313 --> 01:19:31,883
I think I must have been...

667
01:19:32,048 --> 01:19:33,994
I must have been blushing.

668
01:19:34,150 --> 01:19:37,063
It was my first time outside with a boy.

669
01:19:37,220 --> 01:19:39,461
I didn't want to be seen.

670
01:19:39,622 --> 01:19:41,966
It was 8:30 when you came home.

671
01:19:42,125 --> 01:19:45,130
II Trovatore was playing on PBS.

672
01:19:45,296 --> 01:19:49,039
Yeah, when I came home,
my uncle was watching TV...

673
01:19:49,198 --> 01:19:51,337
...so I watched it with him.

674
01:19:51,501 --> 01:19:53,641
Um, just one moment.

675
01:19:53,804 --> 01:19:58,310
II Trovatore.

676
01:19:58,475 --> 01:20:01,046
What is it? It's a foreign movie?

677
01:20:01,211 --> 01:20:04,454
No. No, it's an opera by Verdi.

678
01:20:04,782 --> 01:20:07,592
- Would you like me to write it down?
- I'm fine.

679
01:20:08,619 --> 01:20:10,224
I do hope Whip's okay.

680
01:20:10,388 --> 01:20:12,368
Well, his folks are a mess.

681
01:20:12,524 --> 01:20:16,869
Then again, I have a feeling that he'll turn up.

682
01:20:17,261 --> 01:20:19,208
Boys that age...

683
01:20:19,698 --> 01:20:21,109
Well, you know how they are.

684
01:20:21,266 --> 01:20:23,246
- I'm sure I do.
- Heh.

685
01:20:23,401 --> 01:20:25,847
You will let me know if you hear anything,
won't you?

686
01:20:26,004 --> 01:20:27,450
Will do.

687
01:20:28,307 --> 01:20:30,013
Okay.

688
01:20:30,542 --> 01:20:32,613
Well, I'll be in touch.

689
01:20:32,777 --> 01:20:33,812
Goodbye, sheriff.

690
01:20:33,979 --> 01:20:35,890
Goodbye, sheriff.

691
01:20:40,753 --> 01:20:42,163
Oh.

692
01:20:43,788 --> 01:20:49,535
Oh, by the way, did your housekeeper
ever get in touch after leaving town so quick?

693
01:20:53,333 --> 01:20:54,778
No.

694
01:20:55,801 --> 01:20:57,439
She didn't.

695
01:20:57,870 --> 01:21:02,820
Strange how people
can just disappear on you.

696
01:21:15,622 --> 01:21:17,499
He'll be back.

697
01:21:20,328 --> 01:21:22,364
What are we going to do?

698
01:21:23,764 --> 01:21:29,340
I think we'll really love New York.

699
01:21:37,712 --> 01:21:39,692
When do we leave?

700
01:22:00,269 --> 01:22:02,145
I'm sorry.

701
01:22:09,044 --> 01:22:10,717
Tomorrow night.

702
01:23:29,729 --> 01:23:34,108
- Should we do it again?
- I'm hungry. Let's eat first.

703
01:23:43,576 --> 01:23:48,685
You know, I've often wondered
why it is we have children in the first place.

704
01:23:50,116 --> 01:23:53,620
And the conclusion I've come to is...

705
01:23:56,156 --> 01:24:00,729
...at some point in our lives,
we realize things are...

706
01:24:00,893 --> 01:24:03,738
They're screwed up beyond repair.

707
01:24:05,566 --> 01:24:08,479
So we decide to start again.

708
01:24:09,603 --> 01:24:11,981
Wipe the slate clean.

709
01:24:13,073 --> 01:24:14,950
Start afresh.

710
01:24:18,278 --> 01:24:20,349
And we have children.

711
01:24:21,883 --> 01:24:27,264
Little carbon copies we can turn to and say,
"You will do what I could not.

712
01:24:28,055 --> 01:24:31,833
You will succeed where I have failed."

713
01:24:34,062 --> 01:24:37,942
Because we want someone
to get it right this time.

714
01:24:45,273 --> 01:24:47,379
But not me.

715
01:24:52,247 --> 01:24:57,789
Personally speaking,
I can't wait to watch life tear you apart.

716
01:25:07,763 --> 01:25:09,572
India...

717
01:25:13,403 --> 01:25:15,314
...who are you?

718
01:25:18,307 --> 01:25:21,755
You were supposed to love me, weren't you?

719
01:25:46,970 --> 01:25:49,144
Come up to my room, please.

720
01:25:51,075 --> 01:25:53,715
I enjoyed your performance.

721
01:26:00,484 --> 01:26:03,192
India, go and pack a small bag.

722
01:26:03,354 --> 01:26:05,995
We'll be leaving shortly.

723
01:26:41,294 --> 01:26:42,705
I, uh...

724
01:26:44,564 --> 01:26:46,771
I came to say goodbye.

725
01:26:47,500 --> 01:26:49,378
I can't allow you to do this.

726
01:26:50,003 --> 01:26:51,038
Why not?

727
01:26:57,411 --> 01:27:02,588
There are little things one notices
along the way, but one suppresses because...

728
01:27:03,649 --> 01:27:04,719
Because?

729
01:27:06,120 --> 01:27:07,895
Why do you think?

730
01:27:11,125 --> 01:27:12,160
Love?

731
01:27:15,130 --> 01:27:17,131
Richard loved India.

732
01:27:18,465 --> 01:27:21,503
He would never have driven
so far away on her birthday.

733
01:27:22,202 --> 01:27:27,346
Not unless, for some reason he was called
away by someone he couldn't say no to.

734
01:27:30,110 --> 01:27:32,990
Auntie Gin
wanted to speak to me about you...

735
01:27:33,148 --> 01:27:36,493
...but she never did come back after that night,
did she?

736
01:27:39,354 --> 01:27:43,530
People disappear...

737
01:27:44,392 --> 01:27:46,394
...all the time.

738
01:28:07,851 --> 01:28:12,663
Have me instead,
but stay away from my daughter.

739
01:28:13,189 --> 01:28:14,497
She's of age.

740
01:28:14,657 --> 01:28:16,296
Of age for what?

741
01:28:16,827 --> 01:28:22,708
To live in this house on her own
while her mother finally travels the world.

742
01:28:22,865 --> 01:28:25,244
Don't you want to speak French in France?

743
01:28:26,970 --> 01:28:29,314
What are you suggesting?

744
01:28:39,282 --> 01:28:41,160
Come with me.

745
01:29:39,512 --> 01:29:40,547
India.

746
01:29:40,713 --> 01:29:42,249
India, come here and look.

747
01:29:51,392 --> 01:29:54,463
India, come here.

748
01:30:00,067 --> 01:30:03,014
India! Come here! Now!

749
01:32:47,006 --> 01:32:48,781
In a hurry?

750
01:32:49,976 --> 01:32:52,321
Know how fast you were going?

751
01:32:56,417 --> 01:32:58,020
Pardon?

752
01:33:02,356 --> 01:33:05,633
Effectively fast, Mister Sheriff.

753
01:33:09,698 --> 01:33:11,836
Effective for what?

754
01:33:13,300 --> 01:33:15,473
To get your attention.

755
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:26,000
