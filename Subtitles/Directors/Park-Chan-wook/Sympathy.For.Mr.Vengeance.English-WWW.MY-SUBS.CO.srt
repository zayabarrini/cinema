1
00:00:29,931 --> 00:00:33,833
I'm a good person. I'm a hard worker.

2
00:00:34,569 --> 00:00:37,367
My older sister is the only family I have.

3
00:00:37,605 --> 00:00:39,732
To put me through art school...

4
00:00:39,841 --> 00:00:43,072
she gave up college
and got a job at a factory.

5
00:00:43,811 --> 00:00:48,180
But then she fell seriously ill,
and had to quit.

6
00:00:48,749 --> 00:00:52,185
So I gave up art school and got a job.

7
00:00:52,887 --> 00:00:57,085
But recently I made a decision.

8
00:00:58,726 --> 00:01:02,321
I'm not sure whether to tell my sister
or not.

9
00:01:02,597 --> 00:01:05,464
I'm hesitating even as i write this letter.

10
00:01:06,868 --> 00:01:10,201
If I decide to do it...

11
00:01:10,371 --> 00:01:12,896
I'll be listening to the broadcast
with my sister.

12
00:01:14,609 --> 00:01:16,873
I can't speak with my mouth.

13
00:01:20,014 --> 00:01:25,384
I'm deaf and dumb.

14
00:01:29,056 --> 00:01:34,119
Please read this letter to my sister for me,
since I can't.

15
00:01:37,098 --> 00:01:39,692
Sis, you're listening?

16
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:41,829
You told me if you die...

17
00:01:41,936 --> 00:01:45,463
you want to be buried by the river
where we used to play.

18
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:48,500
All right, I'll do that.

19
00:01:49,043 --> 00:01:52,911
But that 'll be in 40 or 50 years' time.

20
00:01:53,281 --> 00:01:56,341
I'm going to save you.

21
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,543
Really, I swear.

22
00:01:59,687 --> 00:02:04,886
Actually,
I registered to donate my kidney today.

23
00:02:05,693 --> 00:02:07,661
I know you said not to...

24
00:02:07,828 --> 00:02:10,490
that you'd rather die than be a burden.

25
00:02:11,332 --> 00:02:15,098
But you know I never do
what I'm told. Ha ha ha.

26
00:02:27,682 --> 00:02:30,480
Why did you lie that your blood type is a?

27
00:02:31,852 --> 00:02:34,343
I'm telling you,
if the blood types don't match...

28
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,521
then we can't do a transplant!

29
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:46,759
You haven't had a blood test
since grade school, have you?

30
00:02:49,971 --> 00:02:54,067
If you can't pay the hospital bills,
take her home for now.

31
00:02:55,276 --> 00:02:57,938
Until we find a suitable donor.

32
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:03,817
Until then, just keep coming in for dialysis.

33
00:03:04,552 --> 00:03:05,610
Okay?

34
00:03:26,774 --> 00:03:29,504
Your blood type is b, b!

35
00:04:38,379 --> 00:04:43,316
Organs for sale

36
00:09:04,445 --> 00:09:07,972
- hey, come in!
- What's wrong with you?

37
00:09:10,384 --> 00:09:13,217
"What's wrong with you"? You, bitch.

38
00:09:13,487 --> 00:09:15,114
- You are all very lucky.
- Right, here's one.

39
00:09:15,255 --> 00:09:16,984
Yeah, that's right.

40
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:22,691
Man, what is that, that fucking... right?

41
00:09:22,863 --> 00:09:24,922
What's wrong? I wasn't going to hit you.

42
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:27,824
- What?
- Must I hold back?

43
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:38,278
The real estate guy must have thought
it'd be okay since i'm deaf.

44
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:39,905
If my sister can't sleep, then neither can i.

45
00:10:08,776 --> 00:10:10,505
Aw, fucking great!

46
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:12,669
Look here, shit.

47
00:10:40,207 --> 00:10:42,198
Shit, quiet, please.

48
00:11:01,061 --> 00:11:04,724
"The ruling" - by the revolutionary
anarchists' association

49
00:11:18,545 --> 00:11:21,105
we sentence you to death.

50
00:12:13,467 --> 00:12:14,957
I heard that...

51
00:12:17,204 --> 00:12:19,468
this happened in australia.

52
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:27,137
A man thought...

53
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:33,645
he had two heads.

54
00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:43,295
Two heads?

55
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:45,087
Yeah, two.

56
00:12:49,803 --> 00:12:51,998
And he kept getting headaches.

57
00:12:53,674 --> 00:12:58,543
With two heads,
he had headaches all the time.

58
00:13:01,648 --> 00:13:03,275
So you know what he did?

59
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:11,420
He shot...

60
00:13:12,993 --> 00:13:16,053
one of his heads.

61
00:13:23,537 --> 00:13:25,505
The left or the right?

62
00:14:11,918 --> 00:14:16,548
The left or the right?

63
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,835
Aren't you going to lunch?

64
00:14:37,077 --> 00:14:38,135
Come on...

65
00:14:38,478 --> 00:14:42,972
- we have to eat. Let's go.
- Let's go eat something.

66
00:16:53,747 --> 00:16:55,681
You've only got 10 million won?

67
00:16:58,718 --> 00:17:00,413
Well, first of all...

68
00:17:02,722 --> 00:17:06,021
you give us your kidney, then we'll do it.

69
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:12,197
You give us yours
and we'll get you one for your sister.

70
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:14,928
For 10 million won.

71
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,474
Got it?

72
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:56,175
Your blood type's b, right?

73
00:20:26,626 --> 00:20:27,927
21 days later

74
00:20:27,927 --> 00:20:29,622
congratulations! This is great.

75
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:32,960
Finding a donor this fast...

76
00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:35,764
is simply a miracle.

77
00:20:37,637 --> 00:20:41,266
The surgery's in a week...

78
00:20:42,142 --> 00:20:45,134
so have her admitted in five days.

79
00:20:47,981 --> 00:20:50,108
You have got 10 million won
in your account, right?

80
00:20:50,216 --> 00:20:52,309
Ha ha.

81
00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:54,853
So all your problems are solved.

82
00:20:56,456 --> 00:20:57,514
Isn't it great?

83
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:09,227
Are you happy now?

84
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:15,865
You idiot, you stupid fuck!

85
00:21:20,747 --> 00:21:23,580
That money would've saved your sister.

86
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:38,662
Why not?

87
00:21:41,701 --> 00:21:44,033
Now's not the time to be thinking that way.

88
00:21:44,137 --> 00:21:45,536
There's a saying:

89
00:21:46,906 --> 00:21:49,875
"Is a boiled pig afraid of boiling water?"

90
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:51,399
Besides...

91
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:55,580
then what are you going to do?
You've only got a week.

92
00:21:56,015 --> 00:22:00,247
You know how long it'll take
to find another donor?

93
00:22:14,501 --> 00:22:15,798
Is that her?

94
00:22:17,804 --> 00:22:19,135
She's cute.

95
00:22:24,177 --> 00:22:25,667
Must be a friend.

96
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,686
That's the bastard who fired you?

97
00:22:40,126 --> 00:22:41,491
Son of a bitch.

98
00:22:41,995 --> 00:22:44,555
That car's worth 10 years of your salary.

99
00:22:45,398 --> 00:22:47,923
That's why we need a revolution.

100
00:22:48,768 --> 00:22:51,464
So sick people will get free treatment...

101
00:22:51,804 --> 00:22:53,169
and you can get...

102
00:22:53,406 --> 00:22:58,867
any damned organ you need!

103
00:23:02,315 --> 00:23:07,184
The bad image kidnappers get
is because of kids getting killed.

104
00:23:07,754 --> 00:23:10,120
But we're different.

105
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:13,954
Give us the money,
and we'll return the kid pronto.

106
00:23:14,928 --> 00:23:17,123
Shit, I'm afraid she'll grow too fond of us.

107
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:19,528
Maybe she won't want to go home.

108
00:23:19,699 --> 00:23:21,633
She'll be playing with us all the time.

109
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:22,962
What fun!

110
00:23:23,269 --> 00:23:25,328
Won't have to go to school.

111
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:29,799
What?

112
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:31,568
What?

113
00:23:36,349 --> 00:23:38,340
It's summer vacation,
so she doesn't go to school anyway.

114
00:23:54,367 --> 00:23:55,391
Hey!

115
00:23:55,635 --> 00:23:58,866
But think about it from
her parents' point of view.

116
00:23:59,172 --> 00:24:01,732
They'll be so happy to see her again.

117
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:05,909
They'll love her even more,
and the family will be closer.

118
00:24:06,846 --> 00:24:11,044
We really need the money,
so we'll ask for exactly 26 million won.

119
00:24:11,618 --> 00:24:13,984
How conscientious is that, right?

120
00:24:16,823 --> 00:24:19,690
That money's nothing to them...

121
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:22,920
but for us it's a matter of life and death.

122
00:24:23,029 --> 00:24:24,257
Movement of capital...

123
00:24:24,364 --> 00:24:27,595
maximizes the value of money,
so it's not even a crime.

124
00:24:28,167 --> 00:24:29,725
Don't you think?

125
00:24:43,883 --> 00:24:45,248
In this world...

126
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:51,753
there are good kidnappings
and bad kidnappings.

127
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:54,520
A good kidnapping enlists...

128
00:24:54,627 --> 00:24:56,891
the parents' cooperation.

129
00:24:58,665 --> 00:25:00,064
If parents call the police...

130
00:25:00,199 --> 00:25:03,293
the kid dies.

131
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:05,999
The parents pay up...

132
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:11,204
and the kid gets returned.
Then nobody finds out about it.

133
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:16,781
That is why people think
all kidnappings are bad.

134
00:25:42,241 --> 00:25:43,503
Daddy!

135
00:25:44,377 --> 00:25:45,435
What?

136
00:25:45,578 --> 00:25:47,876
Can I go play at yoosun's house?

137
00:25:49,148 --> 00:25:50,172
No.

138
00:25:50,283 --> 00:25:53,343
Then will you buy me
a cell phone like yoosun's?

139
00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:56,518
Hey, president park!

140
00:25:56,622 --> 00:25:59,648
Why do you keep buying her stuff like that?

141
00:25:59,859 --> 00:26:02,555
Have some consideration
for your neighbors.

142
00:26:02,662 --> 00:26:03,856
Oops!

143
00:26:20,613 --> 00:26:21,671
Peng!

144
00:26:23,049 --> 00:26:24,573
President park!

145
00:26:24,784 --> 00:26:29,312
Sir, please help me! My wife ran off...

146
00:26:29,555 --> 00:26:31,853
and my children are hungry.

147
00:26:31,958 --> 00:26:33,721
I'm a founding employee.

148
00:26:33,826 --> 00:26:36,590
In six years I never missed a day of work.

149
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:41,760
You know the percentage
of faulty goods was 0.008%.

150
00:26:41,868 --> 00:26:43,460
0.008% only!

151
00:26:43,736 --> 00:26:45,328
Peng, what are you doing?

152
00:26:45,738 --> 00:26:47,763
I explained it to you already.

153
00:26:47,874 --> 00:26:49,865
And to come to my home...

154
00:26:59,285 --> 00:27:00,411
is he your staff?

155
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:01,644
Yes, engineer peng!

156
00:27:28,681 --> 00:27:30,774
I devoted myself to welding.

157
00:27:31,551 --> 00:27:35,783
I gave away my youth
to llshin electronics, you know?

158
00:28:23,102 --> 00:28:24,160
Daddy!

159
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:25,498
- Are you okay?
- Let go!

160
00:28:29,942 --> 00:28:31,432
- Honey!
- Let go.

161
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:36,471
- I'll go down with a welder.
- Yoosun!

162
00:28:38,684 --> 00:28:41,448
I devoted my life for llshin electronics.

163
00:28:45,157 --> 00:28:48,058
- Hey, let go.
- Kids are dying of starvation.

164
00:28:51,931 --> 00:28:53,865
- Let go of me and talk.
- What if I let you go?

165
00:28:54,166 --> 00:28:55,827
It's not going to work.

166
00:28:55,935 --> 00:28:56,959
Why?

167
00:28:58,304 --> 00:28:59,737
Look at him.

168
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:02,672
I was fired by the kid's father.

169
00:29:03,376 --> 00:29:08,245
I'll be the first person the police call in.

170
00:29:16,222 --> 00:29:17,917
Then what do we do?

171
00:29:23,129 --> 00:29:26,360
Defeat the communists

172
00:29:26,532 --> 00:29:29,660
what a big army!

173
00:29:30,036 --> 00:29:33,233
The way for korea is victory

174
00:29:33,339 --> 00:29:36,365
go forward! Go forward!

175
00:29:36,709 --> 00:29:39,974
Take a step forward towards democracy!

176
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:42,946
Go forward! Go forward!

177
00:29:43,382 --> 00:29:48,319
Take a step forward towards democracy!

178
00:29:48,421 --> 00:29:49,752
Put it down!

179
00:29:49,855 --> 00:29:53,518
Defeat the communists

180
00:29:53,626 --> 00:29:55,856
what a big army!

181
00:29:56,128 --> 00:30:00,531
The way for korea is victory

182
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:04,167
let's go to the victory

183
00:30:09,909 --> 00:30:13,743
let's go to the victory, yeah!

184
00:31:10,069 --> 00:31:11,502
By the way...

185
00:31:16,709 --> 00:31:19,269
how come daddy's friend is so poor?

186
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:21,938
What?

187
00:31:23,349 --> 00:31:24,816
Uh, that's...

188
00:31:24,984 --> 00:31:29,683
we spent a lot of money because i'm sick.

189
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:35,091
What hospital is your mother in?

190
00:31:39,098 --> 00:31:41,794
She doesn't know about the car accident.

191
00:31:41,967 --> 00:31:43,935
Her father said not to tell her.

192
00:32:11,297 --> 00:32:15,393
Daddy was too busy...

193
00:32:16,068 --> 00:32:18,263
so they got divorced.

194
00:32:22,408 --> 00:32:26,777
That's why he left me with you.

195
00:32:35,855 --> 00:32:36,913
Mine?

196
00:32:53,405 --> 00:32:54,702
Don't cry.

197
00:32:55,541 --> 00:32:56,735
Stop it!

198
00:33:36,315 --> 00:33:38,783
He wants to trade it for your doll.

199
00:33:51,664 --> 00:33:54,292
Daddy loves yoosun.

200
00:33:54,934 --> 00:33:57,926
Yoosun loves daddy, too.

201
00:33:58,204 --> 00:33:59,535
More than anything.

202
00:34:06,245 --> 00:34:08,076
I kidnapped yoosun.

203
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:11,240
She doesn't know it.
Send me 26 million won.

204
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:13,648
I'll be in contact.

205
00:35:52,685 --> 00:35:53,879
Hey.

206
00:36:03,228 --> 00:36:05,321
The people i'm most jealous of...

207
00:36:07,533 --> 00:36:09,763
are those girls...

208
00:36:10,102 --> 00:36:13,265
with mommies to braid their hair.

209
00:36:30,255 --> 00:36:33,554
Then come see me sometime.

210
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,320
Really?

211
00:36:54,747 --> 00:36:56,772
Call me anytime.

212
00:36:57,916 --> 00:37:01,317
I'm all alone, so i get bored.

213
00:37:35,421 --> 00:37:40,154
Go to geumho station,
wait outside exit three.

214
00:37:58,544 --> 00:38:01,377
What a big army!

215
00:38:05,517 --> 00:38:09,578
The way for korea is victory

216
00:38:09,688 --> 00:38:13,647
go forward! Go forward!

217
00:38:14,259 --> 00:38:17,387
Take a step forward towards democracy!

218
00:38:22,501 --> 00:38:26,335
Please stay inside the yellow line
as the train approaches...

219
00:39:35,274 --> 00:39:37,765
a discharge allowance

220
00:39:55,027 --> 00:39:59,430
he never said why
he missed work so often?

221
00:40:02,968 --> 00:40:06,631
Then he never went off for special training?

222
00:40:09,808 --> 00:40:13,710
Yes, last week from monday to thursday.

223
00:41:43,135 --> 00:41:46,901
Hey, toad, let's play hide-and-seek.

224
00:41:48,307 --> 00:41:52,539
Hoy, hoy, hoy! Rock, scissors, paper!

225
00:42:15,233 --> 00:42:16,894
She's washing.

226
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:53,094
Hey, porori!

227
00:42:57,175 --> 00:42:58,403
Toad...

228
00:43:02,047 --> 00:43:04,948
- you're captured.
- Hey, you!

229
00:43:09,755 --> 00:43:14,852
Give it! I'm watching cartoons!

230
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:16,554
Really.

231
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,195
- You're captured.
- Hey, porori!

232
00:43:25,704 --> 00:43:27,433
Here, here.

233
00:43:52,931 --> 00:43:55,866
Kidnapping is the worst thing
in the world. How would you...

234
00:43:55,967 --> 00:43:58,993
please send back yoosun asap.
This is my dying wish.

235
00:43:59,104 --> 00:44:01,163
I love you. Bye.

236
00:45:29,861 --> 00:45:32,056
Is anybody out there?

237
00:45:40,739 --> 00:45:42,570
Somebody help me!

238
00:49:51,389 --> 00:49:54,449
Go away! Go away!

239
00:50:06,671 --> 00:50:08,002
Ryu!

240
00:50:09,774 --> 00:50:10,968
Ryu!

241
00:50:18,716 --> 00:50:19,740
Ryu!

242
00:50:25,523 --> 00:50:26,683
Ryu!

243
00:50:37,769 --> 00:50:38,895
Ryu!

244
00:50:40,638 --> 00:50:41,798
Ryu!

245
00:50:42,707 --> 00:50:44,106
Ryu...

246
00:51:12,971 --> 00:51:14,268
ryu...

247
00:52:28,346 --> 00:52:31,406
no! The water's deep, even standing
it's far over my head.

248
00:53:58,903 --> 00:54:01,963
I now know why i thought
the water was deep.

249
00:54:02,073 --> 00:54:04,769
I hadn't gone back since being a kid.

250
00:54:04,876 --> 00:54:06,776
When i was a kid,
it was up over my head. Way over.

251
00:56:00,825 --> 00:56:03,293
Near seomjin river...

252
00:56:12,937 --> 00:56:16,771
have you ever done
anything to provoke anyone?

253
00:56:20,077 --> 00:56:23,012
Please think again.

254
00:56:25,883 --> 00:56:30,752
I always thought i lived an honest life.

255
00:56:36,527 --> 00:56:38,518
That's what everyone says.

256
00:56:39,931 --> 00:56:43,958
Excuse me, but what is your net worth?

257
00:56:46,871 --> 00:56:49,032
I'm a high school graduate...

258
00:56:49,707 --> 00:56:52,005
and i started as an electrical engineer.

259
00:56:56,247 --> 00:56:58,181
When the economy crashed...

260
00:57:00,351 --> 00:57:02,649
my wife left me.

261
00:57:09,994 --> 00:57:12,189
But why i don't understand...

262
00:57:15,766 --> 00:57:18,792
why didn't you call the police?

263
00:57:22,106 --> 00:57:25,769
I thought lots of kids were returned safely.

264
00:57:27,745 --> 00:57:29,736
If i do what they tell me.

265
00:57:32,016 --> 00:57:35,110
Sir, i checked...

266
00:57:35,319 --> 00:57:37,947
and it looks like they
used yoosun's cell phone.

267
00:57:38,122 --> 00:57:41,489
I called but they didn't answer,
so we can't locate them.

268
00:57:42,293 --> 00:57:44,921
This is yoosun's number, right?

269
00:57:51,302 --> 00:57:54,499
My wife gave it to her before she left.

270
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:04,811
Just a second, please.

271
00:58:11,789 --> 00:58:15,088
Yeah, i'm working.

272
00:58:17,762 --> 00:58:21,129
So an operation will take care of it?

273
00:58:26,270 --> 00:58:29,239
Where would I get 10 million won?

274
00:58:31,776 --> 00:58:33,767
What the hell am I supposed to do?

275
00:58:39,483 --> 00:58:42,452
At least our kid wasn't kidnapped
and killed.

276
00:58:44,088 --> 00:58:48,957
We're lucky, you know. 'cause we are poor.

277
01:00:11,475 --> 01:00:12,499
Saw.

278
01:00:27,625 --> 01:00:28,819
Hold it.

279
01:00:30,795 --> 01:00:31,989
One, two...

280
01:00:32,263 --> 01:00:33,389
three!

281
01:00:42,339 --> 01:00:43,363
Saw.

282
01:00:51,348 --> 01:00:52,815
That's not it.

283
01:00:54,351 --> 01:00:56,717
Lung has gone through its course.

284
01:01:39,497 --> 01:01:41,658
It looks like a woman's handwriting.

285
01:01:45,302 --> 01:01:46,667
Do you recognize it?

286
01:02:11,428 --> 01:02:13,123
Yoosun.

287
01:02:34,752 --> 01:02:37,186
Yoosun, mommy was wrong.

288
01:03:13,490 --> 01:03:15,082
Honey, wake up.

289
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:20,479
In the summer of 1996,
there was a stir outside.

290
01:04:22,259 --> 01:04:27,322
They captured an image of a spider that
lives in water, not on tree or between rocks.

291
01:04:27,531 --> 01:04:30,762
There has never been such occasion
in this country.

292
01:04:31,368 --> 01:04:33,836
It was discovered in a remote area...

293
01:04:34,638 --> 01:04:37,198
in kyunggi province, near yeonchun.

294
01:05:43,407 --> 01:05:44,601
Daddy...

295
01:05:45,743 --> 01:05:50,737
why didn't you give me
swimming lessons a bit earlier?

296
01:07:37,888 --> 01:07:40,220
I sold the company...

297
01:07:41,925 --> 01:07:43,984
and I put this house up for sale.

298
01:07:47,030 --> 01:07:48,224
That's...

299
01:07:52,369 --> 01:07:55,031
all the money I have.

300
01:08:17,194 --> 01:08:19,355
Well, there's nothing special about it.

301
01:08:20,964 --> 01:08:22,864
A brother and sister lived here.

302
01:08:24,001 --> 01:08:26,492
They don't know where they moved to.

303
01:08:31,608 --> 01:08:32,939
I'll look into it.

304
01:08:43,854 --> 01:08:46,322
Let's go. Nothing more to see here.

305
01:08:59,002 --> 01:09:00,902
You asked if i ever provoked anyone?

306
01:10:20,183 --> 01:10:21,878
Are you the father?

307
01:10:22,019 --> 01:10:23,850
Well, actually...

308
01:10:24,021 --> 01:10:27,422
I am. How is he?

309
01:10:32,295 --> 01:10:34,456
If i were a very optimistic doctor...

310
01:10:35,565 --> 01:10:37,328
i'd tell you...

311
01:10:39,703 --> 01:10:42,297
there was hope.

312
01:11:42,132 --> 01:11:45,101
When did you first know
we'd become like this?

313
01:11:47,070 --> 01:11:49,004
The moment our eyes met.

314
01:11:51,208 --> 01:11:52,607
You're like an ant.

315
01:11:53,009 --> 01:11:54,237
An ant?

316
01:11:55,212 --> 01:11:59,205
They say ants are psychic.

317
01:11:59,916 --> 01:12:03,909
They predict earthquakes and floods.

318
01:13:49,793 --> 01:13:51,761
That was baek hyun-jin's "affection"...

319
01:13:51,895 --> 01:13:55,262
requested by a man who signed
his name as "ryu of doksan-dong."

320
01:13:55,865 --> 01:13:58,026
Any of you remember this guy?

321
01:13:58,668 --> 01:14:00,363
He was deaf.

322
01:14:00,804 --> 01:14:05,070
He sent a postcard two months ago,
saying his sister was sick.

323
01:14:07,077 --> 01:14:09,602
Oh, no. She passed away.

324
01:14:10,747 --> 01:14:12,544
He says, "I'm the one who killed her.

325
01:14:12,649 --> 01:14:17,348
"My life has no meaning now."

326
01:14:18,622 --> 01:14:20,249
You shouldn't say that.

327
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:24,419
Would she want to see you like this?

328
01:14:25,328 --> 01:14:29,731
Don't forget she's watching you
from above.

329
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:33,565
I know you can't hear me...

330
01:14:33,670 --> 01:14:37,663
but me and our listening audience...

331
01:14:37,774 --> 01:14:39,435
are praying for you.

332
01:14:39,609 --> 01:14:40,906
Be strong.

333
01:14:41,478 --> 01:14:43,070
To help you out...

334
01:14:43,179 --> 01:14:46,876
I'll send you a new
maybell kimchi refrigerator.

335
01:14:47,083 --> 01:14:49,244
You didn't write an address...

336
01:14:49,519 --> 01:14:52,784
so if anyone listening to
this broadcast knows him...

337
01:14:52,889 --> 01:14:55,153
please let him know.

338
01:14:56,359 --> 01:15:00,489
We're waiting for such touching
stories from you, our viewers.

339
01:15:00,664 --> 01:15:05,431
If there's a story you want to tell,
send me a letter.

340
01:15:06,469 --> 01:15:09,370
Our address is seoul, yeongdungpo-gu...

341
01:15:09,472 --> 01:15:11,702
yeouido post office, box #87...

342
01:15:11,975 --> 01:15:14,739
c/o lee geum-hee.

343
01:15:15,679 --> 01:15:18,580
I kept them
because the pictures were pretty.

344
01:15:19,049 --> 01:15:21,517
I cried so much while reading them.

345
01:15:27,424 --> 01:15:31,258
But is he really a kidnapper?

346
01:15:34,064 --> 01:15:35,691
I shouldn't send him a gift, then.

347
01:15:36,032 --> 01:15:37,590
You haven't sent it, have you?

348
01:15:42,072 --> 01:15:46,532
Don't say anything. Just leave.

349
01:15:46,643 --> 01:15:50,443
Don't say anything. Just leave.

350
01:18:56,299 --> 01:18:58,460
Car: Matiz, seoul 3296
color: Orange

351
01:19:00,770 --> 01:19:04,297
he's mentally disabled, not stupid.

352
01:19:32,135 --> 01:19:34,126
President park, this is choi speaking.

353
01:19:40,944 --> 01:19:42,707
Since the autopsy results are out...

354
01:19:42,812 --> 01:19:44,439
and we checked the car...

355
01:19:44,881 --> 01:19:46,508
yes, I know that place.

356
01:19:48,384 --> 01:19:50,113
I'll see you there at 2:00.

357
01:19:50,486 --> 01:19:51,510
Yes.

358
01:20:06,402 --> 01:20:08,870
Yes, I'm calling about the sticker.

359
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:13,133
Yeah, the kidney transplant.

360
01:20:15,244 --> 01:20:16,268
Yes.

361
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:20,474
She wouldn't have lived long anyway.

362
01:20:21,718 --> 01:20:25,154
I searched through the hospitals
and found her file.

363
01:20:26,055 --> 01:20:27,079
Yes.

364
01:20:27,890 --> 01:20:31,587
I was lucky to receive an organ
from a brain-dead patient...

365
01:20:32,195 --> 01:20:33,753
but apparently they didn't
have enough money.

366
01:20:36,366 --> 01:20:37,731
President park...

367
01:20:39,135 --> 01:20:42,366
what I really want to ask is...

368
01:20:42,939 --> 01:20:46,636
what are you going to do
to the bastards when you find them?

369
01:20:47,043 --> 01:20:48,271
Kill him.

370
01:21:26,215 --> 01:21:29,651
Dismantle the conglomerates!

371
01:21:34,891 --> 01:21:37,121
Drive out american products!

372
01:21:42,331 --> 01:21:45,300
Destroy the new liberalism
that ruins the lives of the people!

373
01:21:52,709 --> 01:21:54,802
Drive out american products!

374
01:22:01,184 --> 01:22:04,381
Destroy the new liberalism
that ruins the lives of the people!

375
01:22:20,203 --> 01:22:21,636
I understand.

376
01:22:22,071 --> 01:22:24,938
I'll wire you the money tomorrow,
and then call you back.

377
01:22:39,489 --> 01:22:41,184
Destroy the conglomerates!

378
01:22:44,260 --> 01:22:45,727
Destroy the conglomerates!

379
01:22:47,697 --> 01:22:49,392
Drive out american products!

380
01:23:41,517 --> 01:23:43,144
Are you going far?

381
01:23:45,922 --> 01:23:46,946
Hell, yeah.

382
01:24:54,257 --> 01:24:57,351
Shit, you said I could go first!

383
01:26:01,324 --> 01:26:03,724
It's in an artery, chulseung.

384
01:26:06,629 --> 01:26:07,755
Don't take it out!

385
01:26:18,908 --> 01:26:19,932
Mom!

386
01:27:39,522 --> 01:27:42,582
The noodles were all soggy last time,
so i threw it out.

387
01:27:44,193 --> 01:27:45,888
Yeah, hurry.

388
01:28:00,643 --> 01:28:01,735
Huh?

389
01:29:11,614 --> 01:29:12,808
Where is the bastard?

390
01:29:14,450 --> 01:29:15,508
Fuck you.

391
01:29:42,845 --> 01:29:43,971
Where?

392
01:29:46,949 --> 01:29:48,143
Fuck you.

393
01:29:48,784 --> 01:29:50,752
Tell me, you bitch!

394
01:29:54,356 --> 01:29:55,414
Fuck!

395
01:30:55,217 --> 01:30:58,653
Next time, please don't order just one dish.

396
01:32:14,963 --> 01:32:16,123
Mister.

397
01:32:17,199 --> 01:32:21,431
We didn't kill yoosun on purpose.

398
01:32:23,972 --> 01:32:27,567
I'm sorry, we made a mistake.

399
01:32:29,645 --> 01:32:33,775
But i have something to tell you.

400
01:32:39,321 --> 01:32:43,587
I'm not just any ordinary person.

401
01:32:47,863 --> 01:32:49,956
If anything happens to me...

402
01:32:51,633 --> 01:32:54,761
my organization, a terrorist group...

403
01:32:56,839 --> 01:32:58,431
they'll kill you.

404
01:32:59,641 --> 01:33:02,701
For sure, 100%.

405
01:33:06,882 --> 01:33:08,645
I gave them your picture.

406
01:33:12,821 --> 01:33:16,757
If you want to live, just leave me.

407
01:33:18,360 --> 01:33:22,456
This is for your sake, honest.

408
01:33:28,203 --> 01:33:29,534
And then...

409
01:33:32,007 --> 01:33:33,304
i'm sorry.

410
01:33:36,945 --> 01:33:39,846
100%, really.

411
01:34:53,288 --> 01:34:56,189
She sat next to the deaf kid in first grade.

412
01:34:58,527 --> 01:35:00,859
Then she's deaf, too?

413
01:35:01,897 --> 01:35:02,886
No.

414
01:35:03,432 --> 01:35:06,196
Then how come she went
to the same school?

415
01:35:07,669 --> 01:35:09,261
What I mean is...

416
01:35:09,771 --> 01:35:14,265
she got expelled when
they found out she wasn't deaf.

417
01:35:15,210 --> 01:35:18,475
She went to college a bit,
and was a left-wing activist.

418
01:35:19,114 --> 01:35:22,709
She sneaked onto a boat once,
trying to reach north korea.

419
01:35:23,619 --> 01:35:24,643
And?

420
01:35:27,890 --> 01:35:30,256
She got caught by some fishermen.

421
01:35:30,926 --> 01:35:32,917
She was caught in the net.

422
01:35:33,862 --> 01:35:37,195
She's part of the
revolutionary anarchists' association.

423
01:35:37,799 --> 01:35:38,857
What?

424
01:35:39,034 --> 01:35:40,592
I mean, she was.

425
01:35:43,272 --> 01:35:46,799
Go talk to intelligence
and bring in a few of them.

426
01:35:47,442 --> 01:35:48,807
The problem is...

427
01:35:49,578 --> 01:35:53,776
she was the only member.

428
01:36:32,254 --> 01:36:34,586
Make way please, excuse me.

429
01:36:38,493 --> 01:36:40,188
Move aside, please.

430
01:36:44,633 --> 01:36:46,794
What's going on here?

431
01:36:59,448 --> 01:37:01,746
Excuse me, we're coming through.

432
01:37:27,509 --> 01:37:30,000
I'm sorry, you can't ride here.

433
01:37:42,491 --> 01:37:44,322
It's c-3.

434
01:37:44,726 --> 01:37:48,958
They found some of cha youngmi's
flyers at a crime scene.

435
01:37:50,866 --> 01:37:52,197
What scene?

436
01:37:53,301 --> 01:37:55,201
Three people were murdered.

437
01:41:24,613 --> 01:41:28,413
The organ dealers are dead!

438
01:41:29,017 --> 01:41:31,815
But their sides are cut open.

439
01:41:32,854 --> 01:41:36,620
You know what that means?
He took the kidneys!

440
01:41:38,627 --> 01:41:42,154
President park,
he seems like a real psycho.

441
01:41:42,264 --> 01:41:45,893
Killed three people by himself.
Is he really human?

442
01:41:46,501 --> 01:41:48,093
Give this up now.

443
01:41:49,304 --> 01:41:50,566
I'll return all your money.

444
01:49:11,079 --> 01:49:15,846
I know you're a good guy.

445
01:49:22,290 --> 01:49:23,780
So you know...

446
01:49:29,530 --> 01:49:32,192
the reason why...

447
01:49:35,670 --> 01:49:37,001
i have to kill you?

448
01:49:38,973 --> 01:49:40,065
Huh?

449
01:49:40,908 --> 01:49:42,034
Right?

450
01:51:53,474 --> 01:51:54,600
Hello?

451
01:51:55,076 --> 01:51:57,010
Inchon central hospital.

452
01:51:57,345 --> 01:52:00,041
This is peng yoonchol's father, right?

453
01:52:01,148 --> 01:52:03,673
He just died at 1.20.

454
01:52:03,784 --> 01:52:06,753
Please come in
to take possession of the body.

455
01:52:07,154 --> 01:52:10,351
The mortuary's on floor b2.

456
01:52:10,458 --> 01:52:12,392
You've got the wrong number.

457
01:52:12,493 --> 01:52:13,983
What?

458
01:55:20,481 --> 01:55:22,449
You guys, why are you...

459
01:55:33,060 --> 01:55:35,927
"the ruling." we sentence you to death.

460
01:56:20,040 --> 01:56:21,007
Mister...

461
01:56:24,345 --> 01:56:26,711
if anything happens to me...

462
01:56:28,215 --> 01:56:31,514
my organization, a terrorist group...

463
01:56:33,554 --> 01:56:35,249
they'll kill you.

464
01:56:36,123 --> 01:56:39,217
For sure, 100%.

465
01:56:41,428 --> 01:56:43,396
I gave them your picture.

465
01:56:47,428 --> 01:57:43,396
