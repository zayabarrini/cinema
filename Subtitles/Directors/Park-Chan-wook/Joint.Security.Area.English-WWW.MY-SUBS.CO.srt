00:00:09,617 --> 00:00:13,010
A Myung Film Production

2
00:00:13,781 --> 00:00:16,775
Director: PARK Chan-Wook

3
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,606
Starring: LEE Young-Ae

00:00:49,093 --> 00:00:51,734
LEE Byung-Heon

SHIN Ha-Kyun

8
00:01:43,704 --> 00:01:48,099
Three days have passed
since the hostilities at JSA.

9
00:01:48,388 --> 00:01:52,703
Efforts to hold a joint investigation
between the Koreas have failed...

10
00:01:52,792 --> 00:01:55,308
but negotiators recently
achieved a key breakthrough.

11
00:01:55,395 --> 00:01:59,437
Authorities from both countries
have agreed this afternoon...

12
00:01:59,518 --> 00:02:03,070
to collaborate
on the investigation with NNSC.

13
00:02:03,602 --> 00:02:06,072
While tensions have been running high...

14
00:02:06,164 --> 00:02:09,044
amid suspicions
of North Korea's nuclear programme...

15
00:02:09,127 --> 00:02:13,043
and advance of US naval vessels...

16
00:02:13,131 --> 00:02:14,929
into the East Sea.

17
00:02:15,013 --> 00:02:19,852
Spokesmen from both Koreas
have commented on the necessity...

18
00:02:19,937 --> 00:02:24,856
to resolve this issue
with caution in a reasonable way...

19
00:02:24,942 --> 00:02:27,981
so as to avoid having this trivial conflict
escalate into a war.

20
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:32,620
The subsequent agreement has
the NNSC dispatch judiciaries...

21
00:02:32,869 --> 00:02:37,788
with investigative experience
from Switzerland and Sweden.

22
00:04:01,511 --> 00:04:02,740
Scheisse!

23
00:05:52,933 --> 00:05:55,449
If a battle starts, then
shoot the bastards.

24
00:05:55,976 --> 00:05:57,729
You couldn't kill even one?

25
00:05:58,338 --> 00:06:00,900
You call yourself a soldier?

26
00:06:00,981 --> 00:06:03,577
I thought my primary mission was
to rescue Sgt. Lee.

27
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:04,732
- So...
- So?

28
00:06:05,825 --> 00:06:09,264
So that's why you couldn't aim straight?

29
00:06:09,589 --> 00:06:11,308
Was your order to shoot down trees?

30
00:06:11,391 --> 00:06:14,430
My order was to scare them off
and give cover to the rescue team.

31
00:06:14,513 --> 00:06:17,393
What? Hey, hey.

32
00:06:18,557 --> 00:06:22,473
- You sure you weren't the one scared off?
- I didn't want to start a war, sir.

33
00:06:22,561 --> 00:06:25,521
What? A soldier afraid of war?

34
00:06:26,044 --> 00:06:27,319
You stupid...

35
00:06:29,327 --> 00:06:30,647
What is it?

36
00:06:34,612 --> 00:06:36,012
Reporting, sir!

37
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:47,452
War doesn't break out that easily.
Dismissed.

38
00:06:48,465 --> 00:06:49,615
Yes, sir!

39
00:06:52,789 --> 00:06:54,348
This incident...

40
00:06:56,112 --> 00:06:58,069
isn't it rather obvious?

41
00:06:59,595 --> 00:07:01,712
Some commies kidnap our soldier...

42
00:07:02,197 --> 00:07:05,430
and claim he crossed over voluntarily.

43
00:07:07,282 --> 00:07:08,875
- Am I right?
- Correct, sir!

44
00:07:11,005 --> 00:07:13,237
Our boy... What's your name again?

45
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:18,280
- Sgt. Lee Soo-Hyuk, sir!
- Right, Soo-Hyuk.

46
00:07:19,213 --> 00:07:22,526
Let's wrap this up quickly
so Soo-Hyuk can take a leave of absence.

47
00:07:23,057 --> 00:07:26,894
Our boy here took out two of the bastards.

48
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,740
He's a hero!

49
00:07:30,744 --> 00:07:32,337
Wouldn't you say, Maj. Jean?

50
00:07:33,106 --> 00:07:35,827
Your opinion will be noted
in the investigation.

51
00:07:38,631 --> 00:07:43,072
The NNSC will now be taking custody
of the suspect.

52
00:07:45,037 --> 00:07:48,828
No South Korean military officials
may enter without my permission.

53
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:01,442
Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission?

54
00:08:05,376 --> 00:08:07,767
There are two kinds of people
in this world...

55
00:08:07,858 --> 00:08:11,217
commie bastards,
and the commie bastards' enemies.

56
00:08:12,222 --> 00:08:14,373
Neutral has no place here.

57
00:08:15,585 --> 00:08:17,178
You have to choose sides.

58
00:08:18,147 --> 00:08:19,900
You're from law school, right?

59
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:22,941
I trust you'll make a wise choice.

60
00:08:29,478 --> 00:08:32,040
I'm Maj. Sophie Jean from Switzerland.

61
00:08:32,641 --> 00:08:34,633
This is Capt. Persson from Sweden.

62
00:08:38,006 --> 00:08:40,476
He's still in shock.

63
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:43,682
He was hit with a blunt object.

64
00:08:43,771 --> 00:08:47,084
That bruise pretty much proves
that he was kidnapped.

65
00:08:55,302 --> 00:08:57,898
Deposition

66
00:10:39,438 --> 00:10:41,236
He looks like one of ours!

67
00:10:49,127 --> 00:10:50,561
Get down! Soo-Hyuk!

68
00:11:11,627 --> 00:11:15,418
South Korea's hostile provocation...

69
00:11:15,511 --> 00:11:18,346
to our North defence camp in JSA...

70
00:11:54,307 --> 00:11:57,187
Right over the Military Demarcation Line.

71
00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:00,067
Doesn't it seem a bit acted out?

72
00:12:03,755 --> 00:12:06,988
This is where Lt. Choi's body was found.

73
00:12:09,881 --> 00:12:14,481
And that's where Pvt. Jung fell.

74
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:20,729
A bunker...

75
00:12:26,256 --> 00:12:30,457
Puppet soldiers of the South,
stop intruding into the North.

76
00:12:33,823 --> 00:12:37,978
Pvt. Jung was a talented artist.

77
00:12:38,267 --> 00:12:40,942
He even won a prize in a national contest.

78
00:12:42,271 --> 00:12:46,153
He was popular among the soldiers
for drawing their girlfriends.

79
00:12:47,075 --> 00:12:50,114
Abundant Rice is Communism

80
00:12:50,198 --> 00:12:53,431
As soon as Lee Soo-Hyuk left our post...

81
00:12:53,521 --> 00:12:56,960
Southern soldiers stormed in as if on cue.

82
00:12:58,206 --> 00:13:02,202
It's very lucky that Sgt. Oh has survived.

83
00:13:02,289 --> 00:13:06,570
Otherwise the South
would have been spouting lies...

84
00:13:06,974 --> 00:13:09,206
shamelessly blaming it on us.

85
00:13:10,096 --> 00:13:12,487
That's exactly what they're saying now.

86
00:13:12,579 --> 00:13:14,730
Who's going to believe it?

87
00:13:15,141 --> 00:13:16,814
We have a witness.

88
00:13:25,311 --> 00:13:26,870
Don't get up.

89
00:13:27,713 --> 00:13:31,106
This is Maj. Jean from the NNSC.

90
00:13:38,282 --> 00:13:39,716
Are you okay?

91
00:13:40,725 --> 00:13:43,446
No big deal. It's nothing.

92
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:50,408
This is from a terrorist in Libya.
Sliced me with his knife.

93
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:55,734
Once in Egypt, I had to scrape out shrapnel
with a bayonet.

94
00:13:55,939 --> 00:13:57,089
Wanna see?

95
00:14:00,663 --> 00:14:02,017
Really?

96
00:14:02,705 --> 00:14:04,742
Shall we take a look?

97
00:14:10,312 --> 00:14:12,304
I'm glad you're okay.

98
00:14:14,276 --> 00:14:16,427
Now then, can you tell me about that night?

99
00:14:19,881 --> 00:14:21,793
It's all in my deposition.

100
00:14:22,283 --> 00:14:26,040
You mean the deposition you made
and signed while in a coma?

101
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:31,881
Stupid wench.

102
00:14:33,053 --> 00:14:35,364
What did you just say?

103
00:14:38,938 --> 00:14:42,775
Why is it you all have depositions,
but nobody will talk to me?

104
00:14:49,308 --> 00:14:51,904
Lieutenant, tell us about your vacation.

105
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:53,265
It was the same as any other.

106
00:14:53,352 --> 00:14:55,663
- Come on!
- It was nothing special.

107
00:15:24,861 --> 00:15:26,011
Get down!

108
00:16:13,846 --> 00:16:15,644
Shot twice.

109
00:16:15,928 --> 00:16:18,205
Once in the right chest...

110
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:21,204
crushing the ribs
and passing through the lung.

111
00:16:22,574 --> 00:16:24,725
But that wasn't the fatal shot.

112
00:16:33,664 --> 00:16:35,735
The second one was the real killer.

113
00:16:39,389 --> 00:16:42,542
Judging from the angle,
it was shot at point blank.

114
00:17:08,336 --> 00:17:09,770
As for the next one...

115
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,062
a total of eight shots.

116
00:17:15,943 --> 00:17:17,343
Unbelievable.

117
00:17:18,065 --> 00:17:21,583
Shot from such a close range,
they went right through him.

118
00:17:22,189 --> 00:17:25,308
The first shot hit his face,
probably killing him instantly.

119
00:17:25,632 --> 00:17:29,230
The rest were just shot into a dead body.

120
00:17:30,477 --> 00:17:31,672
Go ahead.

121
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:55,739
Lee Soo-Hyuk.

122
00:17:57,742 --> 00:17:59,859
Now there's a man.

123
00:18:01,825 --> 00:18:03,225
I can see that.

124
00:18:03,307 --> 00:18:05,504
Once while he was on duty...

125
00:18:05,869 --> 00:18:08,863
those guys over there cursed our president.

126
00:18:09,432 --> 00:18:10,991
Soo-Hyuk heard it.

127
00:18:11,074 --> 00:18:15,195
He took a rock and smashed their window.

128
00:18:16,439 --> 00:18:19,353
So I rounded up my men and then told him:

129
00:18:19,802 --> 00:18:21,953
"All right! Way to go!"

130
00:18:22,605 --> 00:18:26,237
Once he got left behind
on a search mission.

131
00:18:27,209 --> 00:18:29,360
Man, the squad was in uproar.

132
00:18:30,132 --> 00:18:34,732
Four hours later, he shows up again.

133
00:18:37,178 --> 00:18:41,140
Says he stepped on a mine
and had to dismantle it.

134
00:18:41,822 --> 00:18:43,222
Damn!

135
00:18:43,984 --> 00:18:45,941
Anyway, I knew then.

136
00:18:47,067 --> 00:18:50,426
This guy, he's unique.

137
00:18:51,551 --> 00:18:53,622
Nerves of steel, I tell you.

138
00:18:54,034 --> 00:18:55,787
Nam Sung-Shik...

139
00:18:56,075 --> 00:19:00,230
you were on duty with Sgt. Lee
on the day of the incident.

140
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,716
- Right?
- Yes, ma'am!

141
00:19:04,964 --> 00:19:06,762
I'm not deaf.

142
00:19:08,807 --> 00:19:11,323
Why did Sgt. Lee go out alone?

143
00:19:13,211 --> 00:19:15,362
An urgent call of nature.

144
00:19:16,054 --> 00:19:18,809
Can a soldier leave his post for that?

145
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:25,733
He said people with constipation...

146
00:19:26,303 --> 00:19:28,420
should seize a chance when it comes.

147
00:20:32,685 --> 00:20:34,039
These are blanks.

148
00:20:34,126 --> 00:20:36,847
Please load the gun as you would normally.

149
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:41,089
So you refuse to say anything?

150
00:20:45,216 --> 00:20:47,448
I visited Kaesong City and saw the corpses.

151
00:20:50,781 --> 00:20:55,415
If you just wanted to escape,
why'd you shoot a man eight times?

152
00:20:57,427 --> 00:21:00,501
I brought photos of the bodies.
Do you want to see them?

153
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:01,659
No.

154
00:21:02,632 --> 00:21:04,225
I don't want to see them.

155
00:21:06,396 --> 00:21:08,035
You've got a nice voice.

156
00:21:50,156 --> 00:21:53,595
Your platoon says
you're very quick with the gun.

157
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:56,958
Are you really that fast? Will you show me?

158
00:21:59,645 --> 00:22:03,482
It's not the speed
that's important in a battle.

159
00:22:06,611 --> 00:22:09,730
It's about how audaciously
you are carrying on in calm.

160
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:12,565
That's all.

161
00:22:15,499 --> 00:22:17,013
All right, then.

162
00:22:17,101 --> 00:22:20,574
Can you load the gun again,
just like before?

163
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:29,427
Are you really a Swiss soldier?

164
00:22:34,277 --> 00:22:39,116
Does Sgt. Lee talk much about army life?

165
00:22:40,763 --> 00:22:44,042
He tries to, but I don't let him.

166
00:22:44,606 --> 00:22:46,883
Has he ever talked about, for example...

167
00:22:46,968 --> 00:22:49,962
how he went on any missions...

168
00:22:50,051 --> 00:22:52,248
or if he got special training?

169
00:22:53,454 --> 00:22:54,854
Special training?

170
00:22:56,617 --> 00:22:58,097
Can you zip me up?

171
00:22:59,019 --> 00:23:03,174
Soo-Jung, you don't worry about Sgt. Lee?

172
00:23:05,265 --> 00:23:08,259
We're not really that serious.

173
00:23:11,071 --> 00:23:14,430
What kind of person is he, in a word?

174
00:23:15,675 --> 00:23:16,664
Well...

175
00:23:17,276 --> 00:23:20,236
Oh, you can tell by
how he treats my brother.

176
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:25,072
My brother never had many friends,
ever since we were kids.

177
00:23:25,764 --> 00:23:29,885
But after enlisting, things got
much better, thanks to Soo-Hyuk.

178
00:23:29,968 --> 00:23:32,119
He's very warm-hearted.

179
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:35,284
Probably because he grew up poor, like us.

180
00:23:35,373 --> 00:23:37,092
Wait a second.

181
00:23:37,215 --> 00:23:38,934
Your brother?

182
00:23:39,617 --> 00:23:41,210
You didn't know?

183
00:23:41,298 --> 00:23:44,417
Pvt. Nam Sung-Shik,
they're in the same platoon.

184
00:23:44,501 --> 00:23:47,495
He kept asking me to meet Soo-Hyuk,
so I did.

185
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:54,864
What?

186
00:23:55,431 --> 00:23:59,188
Is there something on my face?

187
00:24:00,957 --> 00:24:03,115
No, not at all.

188
00:24:26,651 --> 00:24:31,044
There were 11 bullet wounds
on the three North Korean soldiers.

189
00:24:31,773 --> 00:24:33,890
Ten bullets were recovered at the scene...

190
00:24:33,975 --> 00:24:36,809
but one was never found.

191
00:24:37,457 --> 00:24:38,936
It's a missing bullet.

192
00:24:40,258 --> 00:24:43,729
There were five left in your gun.

193
00:24:45,981 --> 00:24:49,862
If you add these up, 5 and 10 make 15.

194
00:24:51,224 --> 00:24:54,855
Since you aren't in the habit
of loading an extra bullet...

195
00:24:54,946 --> 00:24:58,827
fifteen matches the number you had
to begin with.

196
00:24:59,469 --> 00:25:00,663
Then...

197
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:04,266
what's this one bullet?

198
00:25:04,672 --> 00:25:08,029
It was neither shot by you
nor recovered later.

199
00:25:08,114 --> 00:25:11,027
Yet it pierced through a soldier's body.

200
00:25:13,357 --> 00:25:15,394
If someone hid the bullet...

201
00:25:15,478 --> 00:25:20,429
it means he's afraid it might reveal
whose gun fired it.

202
00:25:21,721 --> 00:25:26,114
In other words, there was someone else,
a fifth person at the scene.

203
00:25:28,725 --> 00:25:30,796
What do you think of my theory?

204
00:25:36,169 --> 00:25:40,562
Sometimes they set fires on the DMZ
for good visibility.

205
00:25:42,333 --> 00:25:45,930
One night we burned a reed field.

206
00:25:47,736 --> 00:25:53,371
And all the mines blew up like fireworks.

207
00:25:53,779 --> 00:25:55,371
Then, another time...

208
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:58,931
Was Pvt. Nam with you then, too?

209
00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:13,020
This is the Beretta you had
when you were rescued.

210
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:17,102
Everyone assumed that this was your gun.

211
00:26:19,794 --> 00:26:22,434
I requested an inquiry
on the serial number.

212
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:26,352
This gun belongs to Pvt. Nam.

213
00:26:27,998 --> 00:26:32,596
Pvt. Nam said his gun broke
during the rescue and fired only once.

214
00:26:37,123 --> 00:26:39,399
The Beretta M9 is an automatic...

215
00:26:39,485 --> 00:26:42,683
so the slide cocks back after each shot.

216
00:26:43,447 --> 00:26:45,404
It broke right here.

217
00:26:46,568 --> 00:26:49,481
You know all this, right?
You're the weapons expert.

218
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:54,045
I inspected the gun registered to you
that Pvt. Nam returned.

219
00:26:54,773 --> 00:26:57,527
An antimony-barium reaction
on the gun revealed...

220
00:26:58,255 --> 00:27:00,247
more than just gunpowder.

221
00:27:02,657 --> 00:27:04,215
Bloodstains.

222
00:27:13,223 --> 00:27:17,696
After the first shot,
the slide retracted and then stuck.

223
00:27:21,988 --> 00:27:25,778
And blood from the body
splattered right here.

224
00:27:28,872 --> 00:27:30,590
...and blood splattered right here.

225
00:27:33,635 --> 00:27:36,833
The analysis results matched
with Pvt. Jung's blood sample.

226
00:27:38,397 --> 00:27:40,354
The bloodstains right here...

227
00:27:41,439 --> 00:27:44,876
weren't visible,
and so they weren't wiped off.

228
00:27:50,604 --> 00:27:54,235
Sgt. Lee, have you heard
of the Keeler Polygraph?

229
00:27:55,847 --> 00:27:58,078
Also known as a lie detector.

230
00:28:14,537 --> 00:28:15,526
Yes?

231
00:28:59,803 --> 00:29:04,515
Our people are to protect
our one-of-a-kind Communism...

232
00:29:29,339 --> 00:29:34,290
Diamond Mountain is our mountain.

233
00:29:34,942 --> 00:29:36,455
Our leader...

234
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:41,820
would give all to our people...

235
00:29:52,192 --> 00:29:53,545
Thank you.

236
00:30:53,866 --> 00:30:56,540
Here's Checkpoint 2.

237
00:30:57,228 --> 00:31:00,221
And this is Checkpoint 3...

238
00:31:02,351 --> 00:31:04,183
What are the coordinates here again?

239
00:31:05,193 --> 00:31:07,185
If we're here...

240
00:31:07,594 --> 00:31:09,346
we're at Checkpoint 3, sir.

241
00:31:11,676 --> 00:31:13,314
Those coordinates aren't on the map.

242
00:31:30,767 --> 00:31:32,759
Are you saying we crossed over?

243
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:37,369
Give me that.

244
00:31:49,577 --> 00:31:51,090
We're fucked.

245
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:56,736
Retreat quickly, five o'clock!

246
00:32:42,207 --> 00:32:43,640
Sgt. Hwang!

247
00:32:45,408 --> 00:32:46,841
Lt. Choi!

248
00:32:50,531 --> 00:32:52,203
Help me.

249
00:32:53,893 --> 00:32:57,011
Snow base, snow base. 3-2, 3-2!

250
00:32:58,776 --> 00:33:00,494
3-1, 3-2!

251
00:33:31,074 --> 00:33:32,063
Shit!

252
00:34:45,796 --> 00:34:49,349
I told you not to bring that damn dog,
you stupid shit!

253
00:34:49,601 --> 00:34:51,959
- I didn't bring him!
- You shut up.

254
00:34:52,044 --> 00:34:53,843
I'm stepping on a mine.

255
00:34:58,132 --> 00:34:59,852
We could all die.

256
00:35:01,216 --> 00:35:03,288
Watch out! Careful, there.

257
00:35:04,821 --> 00:35:06,415
Don't come any closer!

258
00:35:07,225 --> 00:35:10,665
One more step, and I'll trip the wire.

259
00:35:11,911 --> 00:35:13,061
Hey!

260
00:35:22,645 --> 00:35:23,999
Hey, shitheads!

261
00:35:25,129 --> 00:35:27,122
You're just gonna leave me here?

262
00:35:29,815 --> 00:35:31,489
You told us to go.

263
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:38,375
I told not to come closer.
When did I tell you to leave, you fuckers!

264
00:35:43,754 --> 00:35:45,188
Would you save me?

265
00:35:51,324 --> 00:35:54,000
A grown man, crying like a baby...

266
00:36:11,191 --> 00:36:12,386
Sgt. Oh!

267
00:36:13,474 --> 00:36:14,989
What if...

268
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,991
Let's just go.

269
00:36:22,366 --> 00:36:23,402
Okay?

270
00:36:27,093 --> 00:36:29,485
Take it. It's a gift.

271
00:36:54,770 --> 00:36:57,971
- Let's go.
- You, too, puppy.

272
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,019
Watch yourself now.

273
00:37:04,864 --> 00:37:08,543
- About that mine...
- Don't live like that.

274
00:37:08,709 --> 00:37:11,385
- Why?
- Just out to save yourself.

275
00:37:11,713 --> 00:37:14,389
Well, it was just...

276
00:37:26,013 --> 00:37:27,208
Rabbit.

277
00:37:36,427 --> 00:37:37,702
Rabbit!

278
00:37:39,191 --> 00:37:41,024
We got your rabbit's dick over here!

279
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:18,634
How can we ever let our land
fall under foreign imperialism?

280
00:39:19,006 --> 00:39:20,201
MP

281
00:39:20,288 --> 00:39:25,243
Our Communist party is the greatest.
Our commander is the greatest.

282
00:39:25,855 --> 00:39:27,449
Hey.

283
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,979
Your shadow's over the line.

284
00:39:31,903 --> 00:39:32,973
Watch it.

285
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:53,244
You writing to Soo-Jung?

286
00:39:55,656 --> 00:39:56,851
Yeah.

287
00:40:06,631 --> 00:40:09,786
I didn't thank you enough
for your help last time.

288
00:40:09,875 --> 00:40:11,947
It was rude of me, brother.

289
00:40:12,198 --> 00:40:14,270
Oh, can I call you brother?

290
00:40:14,802 --> 00:40:16,954
I've always wanted a brother.

291
00:40:17,365 --> 00:40:21,124
After hearing "comrade" all the time...

292
00:40:21,491 --> 00:40:23,849
it's nice to be called brother.

293
00:40:24,254 --> 00:40:26,087
My hobby is baseball.

294
00:40:26,297 --> 00:40:29,178
I was a pitcher in high school.

295
00:40:37,432 --> 00:40:40,633
I'm enjoying the tape you sent me.

296
00:40:41,037 --> 00:40:45,878
Han Dae-Su was hard to take at first,
but I like it now.

297
00:40:46,885 --> 00:40:49,118
Kim Hyun-Shik is good, too.

298
00:40:50,730 --> 00:40:55,366
But don't you have any
female singers down there?

299
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,280
I didn't mean it.

300
00:42:13,362 --> 00:42:16,836
I thought I'd write to him, too, as a joke.

301
00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:21,163
I never thought he'd actually come.

302
00:42:21,253 --> 00:42:23,850
What kind of a crazy fool would...

303
00:42:28,142 --> 00:42:29,292
Goodbye, then.

304
00:42:30,986 --> 00:42:33,298
Wait, I didn't mean for you to go.

305
00:42:36,994 --> 00:42:38,793
You've done a great thing.

306
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:42,438
After half a century of division...

307
00:42:42,842 --> 00:42:45,963
you have breached our tragic history
of agony and disgrace...

308
00:42:46,047 --> 00:42:49,202
broken the dam to reunify our country.

309
00:42:49,291 --> 00:42:52,765
Comrade Lee Soo-Hyuk, we welcome you.

310
00:43:01,227 --> 00:43:02,742
Sorry.

311
00:43:20,413 --> 00:43:21,767
You got a promotion?

312
00:43:21,855 --> 00:43:24,931
Thanks to me,
you've lived to become sergeant, right?

313
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:27,892
If I died,
I'd have moved up to staff sergeant.

314
00:43:28,304 --> 00:43:31,345
Imagine if I'd had the guts
to remove my foot?

315
00:43:31,428 --> 00:43:33,068
I'm the one who saved your lives.

316
00:43:33,151 --> 00:43:35,303
You're full of shit.

317
00:43:36,355 --> 00:43:38,667
Move your army out of the way.

318
00:43:39,039 --> 00:43:42,240
Then we can go ahead
and beat those damn Yankees.

319
00:43:42,804 --> 00:43:45,925
Only two years and two months?

320
00:43:46,649 --> 00:43:50,852
Damn, we served for 13 years!

321
00:43:52,497 --> 00:43:54,775
I'm pretty quick with the gun.

322
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:57,781
I'm bored all the time so I practice a lot.

323
00:43:58,225 --> 00:43:59,979
That water pistol?

324
00:44:00,067 --> 00:44:02,664
Just quit pissing your pants around mines.

325
00:44:19,734 --> 00:44:22,410
Yeah, you're pretty fast.

326
00:44:27,104 --> 00:44:28,744
But have you...

327
00:44:39,801 --> 00:44:41,714
ever shot a man before?

328
00:44:43,126 --> 00:44:44,479
No.

329
00:44:44,887 --> 00:44:47,402
- I have, several times.
- All right.

330
00:44:50,811 --> 00:44:53,964
Okay, I got it. Put it down.

331
00:44:55,294 --> 00:44:57,809
Our comrade's been everywhere...

332
00:44:57,896 --> 00:45:02,177
Africa, the Middle East...
He trained soldiers for 10 years!

333
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:04,971
You didn't know, did you?

334
00:45:05,381 --> 00:45:07,054
That's right, huh?

335
00:45:07,503 --> 00:45:09,495
Hey, Sgt. Lee.

336
00:45:10,345 --> 00:45:14,499
It's not the speed
that's important in a battle.

337
00:45:15,309 --> 00:45:17,619
Combat skills? No such thing.

338
00:45:18,751 --> 00:45:23,066
It's about how audaciously
you are carrying on in calm.

339
00:45:24,595 --> 00:45:26,234
That's all.

340
00:45:26,917 --> 00:45:29,307
Then, what's a great soldier...

341
00:45:30,039 --> 00:45:33,192
like you doing guarding this post
at your age?

342
00:45:33,281 --> 00:45:35,477
Very calmly, of course...

343
00:45:39,486 --> 00:45:40,760
Hey!

344
00:45:41,687 --> 00:45:43,963
You still have that mine fuse I gave you?

345
00:45:44,409 --> 00:45:46,002
Don't lose it.

346
00:45:46,571 --> 00:45:49,804
Hold onto that
and even bullets will pass you by.

347
00:46:18,474 --> 00:46:19,702
Whoa!

348
00:46:20,435 --> 00:46:24,112
Why do you always go crazy
over American things?

349
00:46:24,478 --> 00:46:27,950
Try it, and you'll see
why Yankee stuff is so great.

350
00:46:29,282 --> 00:46:30,955
Must have been expensive.

351
00:46:31,763 --> 00:46:34,962
It's also good for picking stuff
out of your teeth.

352
00:46:44,933 --> 00:46:45,922
What the hell...

353
00:46:49,816 --> 00:46:51,569
Lay down.

354
00:46:52,218 --> 00:46:53,891
I said lay down!

355
00:47:20,038 --> 00:47:21,266
See?

356
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:24,432
I told you about this American shit.

357
00:47:35,089 --> 00:47:38,003
What are you doing there
away from your post?

358
00:47:38,091 --> 00:47:42,052
- It's not that, we were...
- You idiot!

359
00:47:44,896 --> 00:47:49,050
You think you're something
'cause you've been abroad?

360
00:48:03,469 --> 00:48:05,142
You think this is a playground?

361
00:48:05,230 --> 00:48:08,827
You're at the very frontline
of our republic! The frontline!

362
00:48:10,074 --> 00:48:12,794
Take that damn dog to the butchers.

363
00:48:13,036 --> 00:48:15,346
- Lunch for tomorrow.
- What?

364
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:20,034
Our people count on us.

365
00:48:22,723 --> 00:48:25,477
Don't let them down, got it?

366
00:48:40,456 --> 00:48:42,254
Take care of yourself.

367
00:48:44,779 --> 00:48:46,132
Go on.

368
00:48:51,063 --> 00:48:52,895
Watch out for land mines.

369
00:48:57,468 --> 00:48:58,821
Go!

370
00:48:59,829 --> 00:49:01,263
I said go!

371
00:49:04,393 --> 00:49:05,952
Hey!

372
00:49:07,835 --> 00:49:11,386
There's more food on the other side!

373
00:49:12,919 --> 00:49:14,876
That guy's so funny.

374
00:49:16,922 --> 00:49:18,959
- Sgt. Lee.
- Huh?

375
00:49:26,328 --> 00:49:28,160
You're really handsome.

376
00:49:29,170 --> 00:49:31,207
Tell me something I don't know.

377
00:49:31,892 --> 00:49:36,650
Spit it out.
You expect me to read your mind?

378
00:49:38,617 --> 00:49:41,337
Must be nice.
Only three months left to serve.

379
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:44,291
Nope, 87 days.

380
00:49:48,624 --> 00:49:51,698
I'm worried about the rest of my time here.

381
00:49:57,791 --> 00:50:01,627
You want me to introduce you to
some friends?

382
00:50:04,796 --> 00:50:06,070
Who?

383
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:11,989
No.

384
00:50:12,682 --> 00:50:13,956
Forget it.

385
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:35,897
Do I have to go?

386
00:51:36,702 --> 00:51:37,851
What?

387
00:51:40,545 --> 00:51:44,426
After half a century of division.

388
00:51:46,149 --> 00:51:50,782
Overcoming our history
of agony and disgrace...

389
00:51:52,433 --> 00:51:55,586
we're gonna open the dam
to reunification, okay?

390
00:51:58,157 --> 00:52:00,626
Could we maybe open it later?

391
00:52:11,487 --> 00:52:13,604
I've heard a lot about you.

392
00:52:13,848 --> 00:52:15,680
I'm Oh Kyung-Pil.

393
00:52:25,457 --> 00:52:27,449
Hey, Pvt. Nam.

394
00:52:40,347 --> 00:52:41,575
You feel warm.

395
00:53:05,526 --> 00:53:08,486
Feels warm.

396
00:53:15,813 --> 00:53:17,166
- Sgt. Lee.
- Yeah?

397
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:27,214
Come on.

398
00:53:27,661 --> 00:53:30,575
What's wrong with people
of the same blood...

399
00:53:30,664 --> 00:53:33,578
getting together and playing some games?

400
00:53:33,666 --> 00:53:37,981
Is that such a sin?
I mean, did we commit adultery?

401
00:53:38,149 --> 00:53:40,061
Or give up military secrets?

402
00:53:41,031 --> 00:53:42,863
We don't even know any secrets.

403
00:53:42,952 --> 00:53:44,432
Exactly!

404
00:54:58,607 --> 00:55:01,487
Yes.

405
00:55:04,211 --> 00:55:05,200
- Yes.
- Wow.

406
00:55:05,732 --> 00:55:09,204
Southern army, out of the way!

407
00:55:15,539 --> 00:55:16,767
That's it!

408
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:19,335
Oh, yeah!

409
00:55:19,421 --> 00:55:22,381
Damn, I told you we should use pebbles!

410
00:55:23,064 --> 00:55:25,181
What's so hard about this?

411
00:55:29,068 --> 00:55:31,060
Wow! It's erect!

412
00:55:52,165 --> 00:55:53,154
Brother.

413
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:55,360
Payoff time.

414
00:56:02,964 --> 00:56:07,979
My father died young.
So I'm the only man in the house.

415
00:56:10,798 --> 00:56:11,917
Wow.

416
00:56:12,846 --> 00:56:14,365
She's pretty.

417
00:56:15,498 --> 00:56:17,336
Is she really yours?

418
00:56:19,676 --> 00:56:23,811
Don't you have anyone, brother?
Come on, show us!

419
00:56:31,969 --> 00:56:35,419
Holy cow!

420
00:57:30,784 --> 00:57:33,789
What? Don't be ridiculous.

421
00:57:34,319 --> 00:57:39,255
But you remember what
that defected soldier said?

422
00:57:39,984 --> 00:57:42,908
Guards at the border are trained
to draw us to their side.

423
00:57:45,688 --> 00:57:47,492
You're wrong.

424
00:57:51,031 --> 00:57:52,835
He saved my life.

425
00:58:05,132 --> 00:58:07,862
Target US Army every day!

426
00:58:08,346 --> 00:58:11,236
Here we go. One, two, three...

427
00:58:12,203 --> 00:58:13,527
Brother.

428
00:58:14,774 --> 00:58:19,789
Why can't our republic make
a Choco-Pie like this?

429
00:58:23,371 --> 00:58:24,364
Brother!

430
00:58:24,456 --> 00:58:25,495
What?

431
00:58:28,835 --> 00:58:31,234
I was just wondering...

432
00:58:34,741 --> 00:58:36,500
You want to come down to the South?

433
00:58:43,298 --> 00:58:47,023
You can eat Choco-Pie till you burst.

434
00:58:56,394 --> 00:58:58,838
I mean, only if you want to.

435
00:59:03,264 --> 00:59:04,862
Lee Soo-Hyuk.

436
00:59:06,076 --> 00:59:09,400
I'm only going to say this once,
so listen well.

437
00:59:10,696 --> 00:59:12,740
My dream is...

438
00:59:13,870 --> 00:59:16,520
that one day, our republic...

439
00:59:17,325 --> 00:59:21,781
makes the best damn
sweets on this peninsula.

440
00:59:22,266 --> 00:59:23,624
Got it?

441
00:59:30,381 --> 00:59:33,305
Till then, all I can do is...

442
00:59:33,394 --> 00:59:36,124
dream about these Choco-Pie.

443
00:59:42,675 --> 00:59:45,599
Forget it. You've got a fancy mouth.

444
00:59:46,330 --> 00:59:48,134
What? Stop it.

445
00:59:50,107 --> 00:59:51,465
Don't!

446
00:59:52,236 --> 00:59:55,241
Sung-Shik, stop these commie bastards!

447
00:59:57,619 --> 01:00:00,783
You're breaking my balls.

448
01:00:26,183 --> 01:00:30,239
You don't need to rub it.
Just wipe it on with this.

449
01:00:30,522 --> 01:00:32,041
Take them off.

450
01:00:33,977 --> 01:00:36,296
First, shake it well like this.

451
01:00:36,387 --> 01:00:39,037
Then you just spread it on.

452
01:00:41,891 --> 01:00:46,107
This is how you do it. Like this.

453
01:00:46,672 --> 01:00:49,305
Then after it dries, do it again.

454
01:01:11,155 --> 01:01:13,066
Alert! Wake up call!

455
01:01:14,996 --> 01:01:16,190
Emergency!

456
01:01:18,358 --> 01:01:20,235
Hurry up. Stand your post!

457
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:23,959
Move your asses!

458
01:01:25,601 --> 01:01:27,080
This way!

459
01:01:28,763 --> 01:01:30,401
Get your ass down quick!

460
01:01:31,244 --> 01:01:33,679
What the hell are you waiting for?

461
01:01:34,045 --> 01:01:35,194
Hurry up!

462
01:01:35,286 --> 01:01:37,197
- Supply unit!
- Yes, sir!

463
01:01:41,649 --> 01:01:43,640
At 2:35 a.m...

464
01:01:46,011 --> 01:01:48,002
we obtained word...

465
01:01:48,252 --> 01:01:51,245
that Northern troops are massing
along the entire border.

466
01:01:52,894 --> 01:01:54,805
We're at Defcon 3.

467
01:02:09,142 --> 01:02:11,703
You chicken?

468
01:02:13,824 --> 01:02:16,419
Keep your cool, okay?

469
01:02:17,025 --> 01:02:20,063
Just think of it as shooting off a round.

470
01:02:20,147 --> 01:02:22,457
That's all it is, all right?

471
01:02:28,791 --> 01:02:31,306
Mines

472
01:04:10,679 --> 01:04:12,032
Sung-Shik...

473
01:04:15,121 --> 01:04:16,918
let's not go over anymore.

474
01:04:25,085 --> 01:04:27,839
It'll be Jung's birthday soon.

475
01:04:28,607 --> 01:04:30,723
And you're almost out.

476
01:04:33,009 --> 01:04:35,604
We should at least say goodbye.

477
01:04:48,176 --> 01:04:50,930
After I discharge...

478
01:04:53,699 --> 01:04:56,089
don't ever go there alone.

479
01:04:57,380 --> 01:04:58,449
Got it?

480
01:05:13,068 --> 01:05:14,945
Brother! That day...

481
01:05:15,909 --> 01:05:18,470
was the North really going to attack?

482
01:05:18,871 --> 01:05:20,782
How would I know?

483
01:05:21,832 --> 01:05:24,666
The Yankees were about to bomb us.

484
01:05:24,753 --> 01:05:26,266
We're supposed to just sit there?

485
01:05:27,274 --> 01:05:30,790
So don't make any nuclear arms or missiles.

486
01:05:31,156 --> 01:05:32,475
Do I make them?

487
01:05:33,918 --> 01:05:35,317
Why are you getting angry?

488
01:05:36,439 --> 01:05:38,749
Stop talking about war.

489
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:42,356
Everyone just write a
letter to your parents.

490
01:05:43,682 --> 01:05:45,115
And one to Soo-Jung, too.

491
01:05:47,524 --> 01:05:49,480
If war really broke out...

492
01:05:50,405 --> 01:05:53,478
would we have to shoot each other, too?

493
01:06:08,414 --> 01:06:11,691
How about we write each
other certificates or something?

494
01:06:12,776 --> 01:06:16,770
"We hereby certify
that Nam Sung-Shik served the republic.

495
01:06:16,858 --> 01:06:20,898
"Signed, Sgt. Oh Kyung-Pil
and Pvt. Jung Woo-Jin."

496
01:06:20,980 --> 01:06:22,652
Something like that.

497
01:06:23,061 --> 01:06:25,974
- Yeah, good idea!
- Right!

498
01:06:26,182 --> 01:06:28,252
What a load of bullshit.

499
01:06:29,103 --> 01:06:33,256
If Yankee bastards play their war games...

500
01:06:33,345 --> 01:06:36,782
border guards will be obliterated.
Zero chance of survival.

501
01:06:37,507 --> 01:06:41,501
Three minutes into the war,
both countries would be destroyed.

502
01:06:42,150 --> 01:06:46,589
A total wasteland. Don't you get it?

503
01:06:47,552 --> 01:06:49,783
I get it now.

504
01:06:55,796 --> 01:06:58,755
Man, this song reminds me of my mom.

505
01:07:01,519 --> 01:07:02,554
Tell me...

506
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:06,718
why did this singer have to die so young?

507
01:07:08,962 --> 01:07:10,156
Hey!

508
01:07:12,444 --> 01:07:14,036
Let's have a toast...

509
01:07:16,005 --> 01:07:17,802
to singer Kwang-Suk.

510
01:07:28,411 --> 01:07:30,880
Oh Kyung-Pil:
2 Chollima Street, Pyongyang.

511
01:07:31,012 --> 01:07:33,891
Jung Woo-Jin:
3 Yaksan, North Pyongyang Province.

512
01:07:40,377 --> 01:07:42,653
I can't get the right angle.

513
01:07:43,058 --> 01:07:45,014
What?

514
01:07:45,099 --> 01:07:47,409
Oh, nothing.

515
01:07:58,545 --> 01:08:00,776
Squeeze in a little.

516
01:08:04,228 --> 01:08:06,059
Perfect.

517
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:31,793
Aren't you going?

518
01:08:34,282 --> 01:08:35,397
Yeah.

519
01:08:40,645 --> 01:08:41,760
Let's go.

520
01:08:52,210 --> 01:08:53,928
You idiot.

521
01:08:54,451 --> 01:08:58,286
I taught you how to do it,
and you still screw it up?

522
01:09:00,654 --> 01:09:04,125
No matter what I do,
I can't get it to shine.

523
01:09:05,136 --> 01:09:06,330
Let me see.

524
01:09:07,257 --> 01:09:10,250
A soldier's got to get
it right the first time.

525
01:09:10,339 --> 01:09:12,808
I can't do this for you forever.

526
01:09:16,982 --> 01:09:18,017
Oh, wait.

527
01:09:26,386 --> 01:09:28,104
Happy birthday.

528
01:09:38,072 --> 01:09:39,710
Thank you, comrade.

529
01:09:41,554 --> 01:09:42,623
Brother.

530
01:09:44,234 --> 01:09:45,952
Oh... damn.

531
01:09:50,754 --> 01:09:53,063
You're crying.

532
01:09:53,674 --> 01:09:55,630
I can't help it.

533
01:09:57,874 --> 01:10:01,423
I have something for you guys, too.

534
01:10:01,674 --> 01:10:02,663
Yeah?

535
01:10:11,355 --> 01:10:13,391
Where did it go?

536
01:10:18,955 --> 01:10:20,183
What is it?

537
01:10:29,475 --> 01:10:32,114
What the hell did you eat?

538
01:10:32,755 --> 01:10:34,825
Open the door. Open it!

539
01:12:12,959 --> 01:12:14,074
Yes.

540
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:18,029
Yes.

541
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:23,959
What?

542
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:27,829
Why does he want to postpone
the cross-examination?

543
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:35,918
Then tell this to Gen. Pyo.

544
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,434
Whether Pvt. Nam takes a leap...

545
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:41,353
or Sgt. Lee falls into shock,
it's not my concern.

546
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:44,512
I don't have time to pamper the suspects.

547
01:12:44,601 --> 01:12:45,829
Understood?

548
01:14:36,085 --> 01:14:38,201
Here are your depositions.

549
01:14:38,285 --> 01:14:41,197
Read it and tell me if you want
to change anything.

550
01:14:48,925 --> 01:14:50,961
Oh! I'm sorry.

551
01:15:02,126 --> 01:15:03,115
This is correct.

552
01:15:03,766 --> 01:15:04,755
Yes.

553
01:15:16,367 --> 01:15:19,484
You recognize this? It's the crime scene.

554
01:15:21,847 --> 01:15:23,439
Lt. Choi Man-Soo.

555
01:15:24,807 --> 01:15:26,604
Sgt. Oh Kyung-Pil.

556
01:15:27,967 --> 01:15:29,605
And Pvt. Jung Woo-Jin.

557
01:15:31,407 --> 01:15:34,126
How many Southern soldiers
attacked the post?

558
01:15:34,847 --> 01:15:35,996
Only one.

559
01:15:37,447 --> 01:15:39,039
Are you sure?

560
01:15:40,447 --> 01:15:41,800
I'm sure.

561
01:15:44,128 --> 01:15:45,197
All right.

562
01:15:47,968 --> 01:15:49,720
This is Sgt. Lee Soo-Hyuk.

563
01:16:00,328 --> 01:16:02,000
Do you recognize him?

564
01:16:06,728 --> 01:16:07,956
A Southern puppet.

565
01:16:27,569 --> 01:16:28,922
What is this?

566
01:16:29,009 --> 01:16:30,362
What is going on here?

567
01:16:30,449 --> 01:16:33,885
This is another soldier presumed
to have been at the scene.

568
01:16:33,970 --> 01:16:37,121
He's in a coma,
so he couldn't make it today.

569
01:16:40,170 --> 01:16:41,888
"Presumed"?

570
01:16:41,970 --> 01:16:43,926
With what evidence?

571
01:16:44,010 --> 01:16:48,003
During his interrogation, when told
he would take a lie-detector test...

572
01:16:48,090 --> 01:16:51,321
Pvt. Nam attempted suicide on the spot.

573
01:16:51,410 --> 01:16:54,720
We have no choice but to consider this
as a confession.

574
01:16:54,810 --> 01:16:59,326
Therefore, I propose we start
the investigation all over again.

575
01:16:59,411 --> 01:17:01,322
We didn't come here to
listen to your stories.

576
01:17:01,411 --> 01:17:02,969
Please, stop!

577
01:17:30,212 --> 01:17:32,248
You son of a bitch!

578
01:17:36,772 --> 01:17:38,603
You capitalist bastard!

579
01:17:38,692 --> 01:17:40,603
You know how long I've waited for this?

580
01:17:40,692 --> 01:17:42,569
- Sergeant!
- Damn puppet!

581
01:17:43,212 --> 01:17:45,362
- You know how long?
- Comrade!

582
01:17:45,492 --> 01:17:46,607
Take your hands off!

583
01:17:46,732 --> 01:17:48,882
I'll show you the power of our republic!

584
01:17:49,852 --> 01:17:51,649
You capitalist pig!

585
01:18:11,493 --> 01:18:14,803
Son of a bitch! Traitor to the people!

586
01:18:14,893 --> 01:18:17,487
- Yankee puppet!
- Sergeant, Kyung-Pil!

587
01:18:17,574 --> 01:18:20,247
Long live the Chosun Labour Party!

588
01:18:21,334 --> 01:18:22,369
Our honoured leader...

589
01:18:22,454 --> 01:18:26,049
long live Supreme Commander Kim Jong-ll!

590
01:19:01,535 --> 01:19:02,888
Goodbye, sir!

591
01:19:26,496 --> 01:19:27,975
Panmungak

592
01:22:33,024 --> 01:22:35,939
Adieu, mademoiselle.

593
01:24:23,730 --> 01:24:26,532
I'm sorry to make you come.
I know you're still ill.

594
01:24:29,017 --> 01:24:33,653
This states my dismissal from
the JSA case from midnight tomorrow.

595
01:24:34,665 --> 01:24:37,182
I heard about your father.

596
01:24:52,491 --> 01:24:56,809
So you heard my father was
a North Korean general?

597
01:24:56,898 --> 01:24:58,572
How does that make you feel?

598
01:24:59,061 --> 01:25:00,621
Like a friend.

599
01:25:07,113 --> 01:25:09,232
I still have a bruise...

600
01:25:10,998 --> 01:25:13,196
but you seem okay.

601
01:25:15,885 --> 01:25:18,448
Your grip must be stronger than Sgt. Oh's.

602
01:25:22,255 --> 01:25:25,696
All right, the real show starts now.

603
01:25:25,780 --> 01:25:26,850
Watch carefully.

604
01:25:32,269 --> 01:25:36,791
As soon as I met Soo-Jung,
I knew I had seen her face before.

605
01:25:37,757 --> 01:25:41,880
And it wasn't hard to figure out
who she was.

606
01:25:43,405 --> 01:25:45,717
This is a picture drawn by Pvt. Jung.

607
01:25:47,772 --> 01:25:49,207
And this...

608
01:25:50,616 --> 01:25:52,609
This picture was found
on Pvt. Jung's body.

609
01:25:54,942 --> 01:25:58,826
If the missing bullet
broke Pvt. Nam's alibi...

610
01:26:00,310 --> 01:26:02,348
then this missing face...

611
01:26:02,433 --> 01:26:06,591
proves that the four soldiers
must have been friends.

612
01:26:14,370 --> 01:26:15,565
So?

613
01:26:17,695 --> 01:26:20,975
These are two completely different reports.

614
01:26:21,060 --> 01:26:24,136
Which one I submit is up to you.

615
01:26:30,113 --> 01:26:33,189
If you tell me the truth...

616
01:26:33,278 --> 01:26:37,162
I won't leave my successor
any of this information.

617
01:26:41,770 --> 01:26:43,410
Is that a threat?

618
01:26:44,935 --> 01:26:46,130
It's a deal, rather.

619
01:26:46,978 --> 01:26:50,771
I don't care whether
I go to jail or get a medal.

620
01:26:51,264 --> 01:26:53,097
So what can you offer me...

621
01:26:54,389 --> 01:26:56,508
if I tell you the truth?

622
01:27:00,317 --> 01:27:03,154
Something you tried to
protect till the end...

623
01:27:04,363 --> 01:27:06,356
Sgt. Oh's safety.

624
01:27:58,802 --> 01:28:01,080
Comrade Choi, please calm down.

625
01:28:01,166 --> 01:28:02,840
- I'll explain everything.
- What is this?

626
01:28:04,050 --> 01:28:05,485
What's going on here?

627
01:28:05,813 --> 01:28:08,125
Please, put the gun down.
You, too, Soo-Hyuk!

628
01:28:13,744 --> 01:28:15,543
You bastard!

629
01:28:15,907 --> 01:28:19,382
I put you on guard and you
screw around with these puppets?

630
01:28:20,394 --> 01:28:21,669
Arrest them now!

631
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:28,320
They came here to discuss coming up North.

632
01:28:29,407 --> 01:28:31,526
I'll take care of everything.

633
01:28:31,610 --> 01:28:34,127
Jung Woo-Jin, this is a direct order.

634
01:28:34,214 --> 01:28:37,574
These scumbags are our enemies.
Disarm them now.

635
01:28:38,821 --> 01:28:40,302
Shoot them!

636
01:28:43,748 --> 01:28:46,219
I'll take full responsibility. Don't move!

637
01:28:46,632 --> 01:28:48,352
Do what I say now...

638
01:28:48,435 --> 01:28:51,397
and I'll overlook this treasonable act.

639
01:28:54,403 --> 01:28:55,997
Do it now!

640
01:28:58,489 --> 01:29:00,209
Comrade Oh, I'm sorry.

641
01:29:08,664 --> 01:29:10,897
Soo-Hyuk...

642
01:29:10,987 --> 01:29:13,140
put your gun down.

643
01:29:13,231 --> 01:29:15,189
There's no other way.

644
01:29:18,518 --> 01:29:19,872
No.

645
01:29:21,242 --> 01:29:23,075
I'll help you come to the North.

646
01:29:23,165 --> 01:29:26,400
You can live with us in our republic, okay?

647
01:29:27,491 --> 01:29:28,607
All right?

648
01:29:30,656 --> 01:29:32,216
Put the gun down first and we'll talk.

649
01:29:32,298 --> 01:29:33,493
Fuck that!

650
01:29:34,982 --> 01:29:37,260
You know better.
This asshole can't be trusted.

651
01:29:38,227 --> 01:29:41,303
You said it yourself.
He's an ambitious prick.

652
01:29:42,754 --> 01:29:46,877
He'll kill us both
and say we infiltrated enemy territory.

653
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:49,079
I promise I'll protect you.

654
01:29:49,804 --> 01:29:51,033
You still don't trust me?

655
01:29:52,648 --> 01:29:54,881
Sung-Shik, you trust me. Talk to him.

656
01:29:58,577 --> 01:30:01,778
Could this be a trap?

657
01:30:01,861 --> 01:30:02,897
Soo-Hyuk, brother!

658
01:30:03,624 --> 01:30:07,417
You remember when Comrade Oh
saved you from the mine?

659
01:30:08,631 --> 01:30:09,667
Don't you?

660
01:30:11,235 --> 01:30:13,114
Please put the gun down, okay?

661
01:30:19,367 --> 01:30:20,517
Fuck it!

662
01:30:22,211 --> 01:30:25,127
Fuck this "brother" shit.

663
01:30:28,059 --> 01:30:29,334
We're enemies, after all.

664
01:30:42,080 --> 01:30:43,674
You said I was chicken, right?

665
01:30:44,283 --> 01:30:47,963
Fine, see if I can kill
this bastard or not.

666
01:30:48,810 --> 01:30:50,130
Just watch.

667
01:30:51,173 --> 01:30:52,368
Hey, Soo-Hyuk!

668
01:30:53,617 --> 01:30:57,410
We're all going to die this way.

669
01:30:58,664 --> 01:31:01,626
Let's start over.

670
01:31:05,554 --> 01:31:07,353
Put your guns down together.

671
01:31:08,118 --> 01:31:09,393
You, too, Woo-Jin!

672
01:31:17,652 --> 01:31:18,847
Just put them down.

673
01:31:21,097 --> 01:31:22,087
Down.

674
01:31:27,065 --> 01:31:28,739
Something's not right.

675
01:33:25,477 --> 01:33:27,914
Guard unit, respond! I repeat, respond!

676
01:33:37,094 --> 01:33:38,084
Sung-Shik!

677
01:34:27,568 --> 01:34:29,083
Listen carefully.

678
01:34:29,170 --> 01:34:30,969
Say you were kidnapped and then escaped.

679
01:34:31,053 --> 01:34:33,206
And you were never here. Got it?

680
01:34:33,296 --> 01:34:35,608
Now go. Hurry, there's no time!

681
01:34:37,703 --> 01:34:38,693
Go.

682
01:34:50,520 --> 01:34:51,920
Soo-Hyuk...

683
01:35:59,936 --> 01:36:01,417
Who the hell's that?

684
01:36:01,499 --> 01:36:03,173
He looks like one of ours!

685
01:36:08,508 --> 01:36:09,908
Sung-Shik!

686
01:36:43,076 --> 01:36:44,636
Get down!

687
01:37:25,375 --> 01:37:26,775
Flare bomb!

688
01:37:38,353 --> 01:37:40,186
Soo-Hyuk!

689
01:37:40,516 --> 01:37:43,317
Cover us! You bastards!

690
01:37:43,880 --> 01:37:45,793
Burn them down!

691
01:37:55,096 --> 01:37:58,410
Open the door! Get the door!

692
01:38:25,859 --> 01:38:29,493
So that's how Pvt. Jung
ended up dying on his birthday.

693
01:38:32,067 --> 01:38:34,185
I don't think about the dead.

694
01:38:38,316 --> 01:38:41,676
Do you think you can forgive Pvt. Nam
and Sgt. Lee?

695
01:38:50,733 --> 01:38:52,053
May I have one?

696
01:39:10,040 --> 01:39:13,320
If this had happened at a Southern post...

697
01:39:16,369 --> 01:39:18,282
I would have shot first.

698
01:39:30,869 --> 01:39:32,987
I heard you're being discharged.

699
01:39:36,757 --> 01:39:38,795
How does it feel to leave Panmunjom?

700
01:39:48,974 --> 01:39:52,209
Sgt. Lee is being sent
to Yongsan Hospital today.

701
01:39:53,580 --> 01:39:55,652
Do you have any messages for him?

702
01:40:24,623 --> 01:40:26,263
He's made good use of it.

703
01:40:26,746 --> 01:40:28,500
He said he's going to quit smoking.

704
01:40:29,510 --> 01:40:31,025
You know that missing bullet?

705
01:40:31,272 --> 01:40:34,986
Sgt. Oh threw it into the reservoir
with the cassette player.

706
01:40:40,125 --> 01:40:44,123
I guess I've left a stain on your career.

707
01:40:45,893 --> 01:40:47,009
It doesn't matter.

708
01:40:48,216 --> 01:40:50,209
That's what I chose.

709
01:40:53,063 --> 01:40:55,979
There was one inconsistency
in Sgt. Oh's testimony.

710
01:40:57,308 --> 01:40:59,380
He said Pvt. Nam didn't kill Pvt. Jung.

711
01:40:59,832 --> 01:41:01,745
It was you.

712
01:41:03,357 --> 01:41:04,552
It all happened so quickly...

713
01:41:04,639 --> 01:41:06,711
you must have remembered it wrong.

714
01:41:07,523 --> 01:41:09,960
Or Sgt. Oh made a mistake.

715
01:41:11,368 --> 01:41:15,525
But what does it matter
who shot a second quicker or later?

716
01:41:32,918 --> 01:41:36,119
I hope you get well soon.

717
01:44:52,635 --> 01:44:54,309
Thank you.
