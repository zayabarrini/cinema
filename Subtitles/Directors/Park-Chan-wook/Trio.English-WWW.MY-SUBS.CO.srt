00:01:18,757 --> 00:01:22,257
 <i>Until that day when the
waters of the East Sea run dry,</i>

3
00:01:22,486 --> 00:01:26,135
When you see this ocean,
what comes to mind?

4
00:01:29,645 --> 00:01:30,825
Eternal...

5
00:01:33,019 --> 00:01:34,682
Forgiveness.

6
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:37,304
The boss...

7
00:01:38,421 --> 00:01:39,858
is infuriated.

8
00:01:40,793 --> 00:01:45,209
<i>1,200 kilometres of splendid
rivers and mountains</i>

9
00:01:45,289 --> 00:01:49,636
 <i>covered with mugunghwa blossoms.</i>

10
00:01:51,726 --> 00:01:53,477
Is this real gold?

11
00:01:54,308 --> 00:01:55,341
Yes.

12
00:01:56,668 --> 00:01:57,980
And what's this?

13
00:01:59,178 --> 00:02:00,775
A four leaf clover.

14
00:02:01,684 --> 00:02:03,662
Don't use English, you arsehole.

15
00:02:03,713 --> 00:02:05,873
Why you wearing that <i>Rabbit Grass</i>?

16
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:07,829
You really don't know?

17
00:02:07,835 --> 00:02:09,231
You being clever?

18
00:02:10,011 --> 00:02:12,806
One day,
while Napoleon was on horseback,

19
00:02:12,895 --> 00:02:15,422
he saw a four-leaf clover...
I mean <i>Rabbit Grass</i>.

20
00:02:15,484 --> 00:02:17,441
Intrigued,
he got off his horse to pick it.

21
00:02:17,449 --> 00:02:20,050
And narrowly, a bullet just passed him.

22
00:02:20,469 --> 00:02:22,006
Why did the bullet pass him?

23
00:02:22,098 --> 00:02:23,674
Don't you know?

24
00:02:23,707 --> 00:02:25,384
Obviously, it was shot at him.

25
00:02:26,274 --> 00:02:27,272
'Obv..'

26
00:02:27,978 --> 00:02:29,079
'Obviously'?

27
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:31,107
You getting cocky, you little shit.

28
00:02:31,163 --> 00:02:33,767
And you! Can't you sing something else?

29
00:02:33,815 --> 00:02:35,453
That dumb ass.

30
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:37,045
Please forgive me.

31
00:02:37,224 --> 00:02:38,222
For what?

32
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,847
For being arrogant.

33
00:02:40,671 --> 00:02:41,669
For that?

34
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:43,728
And then?

35
00:02:44,214 --> 00:02:45,212
Then what?

36
00:02:46,161 --> 00:02:48,488
What piece of shit fired the bullet?

37
00:02:48,539 --> 00:02:50,081
You're so frustrating.

38
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,837
That's not important.

39
00:02:52,221 --> 00:02:54,754
Napoleon's life being
saved because of a four

40
00:02:54,827 --> 00:02:57,273
leaf <i>Rabbit Grass</i>
is what's important.

41
00:02:58,835 --> 00:03:00,957
I know, I get it you shit.

42
00:03:04,766 --> 00:03:06,862
Did your girlfriend give you this?

43
00:03:07,099 --> 00:03:08,097
Yes.

44
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,512
Is it a sign of her love?

45
00:03:11,242 --> 00:03:12,918
It's a symbol of luck.

46
00:03:13,469 --> 00:03:16,106
She gave it to me on Valentine's Day.

47
00:03:22,174 --> 00:03:23,504
Valentine.

48
00:03:25,335 --> 00:03:26,498
It's good.

49
00:03:27,414 --> 00:03:28,692
Don't you think?

50
00:03:32,562 --> 00:03:34,599
Ah, this arsehole,

51
00:03:35,812 --> 00:03:37,488
keeps using English.

52
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:20,867
This is made in Italy.

53
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:23,513
If buying new,
it's at least 3000 dollars...

54
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:25,715
This guy!

55
00:04:26,045 --> 00:04:28,020
Who are you trying to scam!

56
00:04:28,284 --> 00:04:29,987
Can't fool me.

57
00:04:30,598 --> 00:04:32,319
Just even at this place alone,

58
00:04:32,411 --> 00:04:35,313
I've been specialising in
instruments for 20 yrs.

59
00:04:36,493 --> 00:04:39,218
There's no way a horn is 3 grand!

60
00:04:40,573 --> 00:04:42,442
It's not a horn.

61
00:04:44,545 --> 00:04:46,367
It's an alto saxophone.

62
00:04:46,994 --> 00:04:48,112
Don't like it?

63
00:04:48,646 --> 00:04:49,923
Forget it then.

64
00:04:51,459 --> 00:04:53,811
'Blessed are the merciful,'

65
00:04:53,926 --> 00:04:56,345
 'for they will be shown mercy'

66
00:04:56,409 --> 00:04:57,534
Gospel of Matthew.

67
00:04:57,755 --> 00:04:59,192
Chapter 5, verse 7.

68
00:05:00,986 --> 00:05:02,671
I'm sorry to say but

69
00:05:02,912 --> 00:05:04,987
That cross and those pictures

70
00:05:05,082 --> 00:05:07,228
were all made from money.

71
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,315
You're not a believer?

72
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:17,539
I believe.

73
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:21,555
That's why I bought these cheap
artefacts to help out.

74
00:05:26,899 --> 00:05:29,664
The church I used to go to closed down.

75
00:05:31,604 --> 00:05:33,800
Please add 100 dollars more.

76
00:05:34,368 --> 00:05:36,629
I don't have medicine
money for my child.

77
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,676
You should pray. Pray.

78
00:05:40,324 --> 00:05:41,322
Okay.

79
00:05:41,546 --> 00:05:42,544
Fine.

80
00:05:43,703 --> 00:05:44,701
Then,

81
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,156
just play me a hymn

82
00:05:47,243 --> 00:05:49,209
gracefully right here.

83
00:06:47,207 --> 00:06:48,205
Here.

84
00:06:50,295 --> 00:06:52,091
Are you really a musician?

85
00:06:52,771 --> 00:06:54,402
Sure you didn't just steal that?

86
00:07:15,113 --> 00:07:16,918
You ordered food again?

87
00:07:25,496 --> 00:07:27,173
Why are you still here?

88
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:28,964
Please.

89
00:07:29,044 --> 00:07:30,375
Just for one day.

90
00:07:33,682 --> 00:07:36,901
How are you trying to borrow an
instrument that's for sale?

91
00:07:55,551 --> 00:07:56,549
You.

92
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,058
You.

93
00:08:06,254 --> 00:08:07,252
You too.

94
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,298
Excuse me.

95
00:08:16,912 --> 00:08:18,322
No sax player?

96
00:08:21,902 --> 00:08:23,479
Since Bong-Ju Lee passed away,

97
00:08:23,495 --> 00:08:25,991
no one has looked for a sax player.

98
00:10:22,128 --> 00:10:23,869
I put her in your hands,
mother-in-law.

99
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,632
Wake up and say goodbye
to your father.

100
00:12:13,922 --> 00:12:15,439
It's been awhile.

101
00:12:15,704 --> 00:12:17,573
How you like the place?
I found it recently.

102
00:12:17,686 --> 00:12:19,213
The girls are hot here right?

103
00:12:20,512 --> 00:12:22,112
Look at them there.

104
00:12:23,873 --> 00:12:25,513
I called your house but...

105
00:12:28,594 --> 00:12:31,469
Who calls the pager of a man
attempting to commit suicude?

106
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:33,707
Brother,

107
00:12:34,109 --> 00:12:36,304
you haven't broken that habit yet?

108
00:12:36,701 --> 00:12:39,561
Van Gogh had a suicide habit too
you brat.

109
00:12:40,218 --> 00:12:41,793
Next time you try it,

110
00:12:43,965 --> 00:12:45,517
turn off your pager first.

111
00:12:47,671 --> 00:12:49,517
Is Bong-Pal treating you well?

112
00:12:49,565 --> 00:12:52,035
How dare you call the
Chairman by his name.

113
00:12:53,043 --> 00:12:54,161
I don't know.

114
00:12:55,117 --> 00:12:57,312
School is more boring than I thought.

115
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:00,719
You know we can't endure boredom.

116
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:03,156
Just think this will be your
life long organisation

117
00:13:03,362 --> 00:13:04,645
 And dedicate yourself.

118
00:13:05,282 --> 00:13:07,151
They won't let me grow my hair.

119
00:13:07,753 --> 00:13:09,678
I can only wear black.

120
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:12,651
Fuck, are we wearing uniforms?

121
00:13:15,013 --> 00:13:17,064
How long are you
going to live like this?

122
00:13:18,836 --> 00:13:19,930
You know,

123
00:13:20,027 --> 00:13:22,400
I'm really trying hard
to be a good person.

124
00:13:22,451 --> 00:13:23,649
So don't be like that.

125
00:13:27,183 --> 00:13:29,179
I'll have a coffee too dear.

126
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,763
And what will you do now?

127
00:13:43,586 --> 00:13:44,980
Where was I?

128
00:13:45,052 --> 00:13:47,268
I said, what will you do now?

129
00:13:49,122 --> 00:13:50,799
Fuck, I'll do what I wanna do.

130
00:13:51,773 --> 00:13:53,343
Even if I'm starving,

131
00:13:53,394 --> 00:13:56,457
I won't eat rotten meat, and
live like the <i>Leopard of Kilimanjaro</i>.

132
00:13:57,821 --> 00:14:00,277
As it's a life of getting fucked anyway,

133
00:14:00,454 --> 00:14:02,883
I'm gonna do one big job
and live a long life.

134
00:14:06,851 --> 00:14:07,989
Brother, your IQ is 150

135
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,038
Mine is 80.

136
00:14:09,304 --> 00:14:11,100
I'll do all the dirty work.

137
00:14:11,203 --> 00:14:13,365
Just lend me your brains
and skills brother.

138
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:16,296
That brain of yours.

139
00:14:16,407 --> 00:14:18,062
Where are you going to use it.

140
00:14:19,355 --> 00:14:23,253
Honestly, why you're so smart now is
all because of me.

141
00:14:23,396 --> 00:14:24,761
When you were in the joint,

142
00:14:24,812 --> 00:14:27,363
how many books did I send you?

143
00:14:28,259 --> 00:14:29,272
Three.

144
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:31,528
Hyun-Sae Lee's comic 'Pongjjak',
vol. 1,2,3

145
00:14:32,311 --> 00:14:33,317
Is that so?

146
00:14:33,368 --> 00:14:34,514
I've graduated.

147
00:14:34,569 --> 00:14:35,932
In life,

148
00:14:37,014 --> 00:14:38,623
there's no graduating.

149
00:14:39,883 --> 00:14:41,400
I've dropped out then.

150
00:14:42,831 --> 00:14:43,829
Oh really.

151
00:14:44,689 --> 00:14:46,807
Should I make you return to school then?

152
00:14:59,933 --> 00:15:01,080
This arsehole,

153
00:15:01,173 --> 00:15:02,958
singing in English.

154
00:15:06,644 --> 00:15:07,682
What's this.

155
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:37,133
You pieces of shit.

156
00:15:37,372 --> 00:15:41,121
Stop whining and hand over
all the money you have.

157
00:15:41,882 --> 00:15:43,117
Fuck. Look at them cower.

158
00:15:43,245 --> 00:15:44,602
Brother, get up.

159
00:15:47,814 --> 00:15:48,835
Brother.

160
00:15:48,884 --> 00:15:51,746
We're going turn this fucked up
world upside down.

161
00:15:52,732 --> 00:15:53,730
Take it.

162
00:15:54,232 --> 00:15:55,230
Take it!

163
00:15:56,139 --> 00:15:57,816
Do you know what the meaning of life is?

164
00:15:57,946 --> 00:16:00,409
You can't come in like the wind,
and then leave like the dew.

165
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,498
That's life.

166
00:16:01,977 --> 00:16:03,689
Look at these arseholes.

167
00:16:03,753 --> 00:16:06,659
You're not gonna get up?
You're not? I said get up!

168
00:16:11,314 --> 00:16:13,908
You have to realise how lucky you are.

169
00:16:14,454 --> 00:16:15,974
Lift your heads up!

170
00:16:16,025 --> 00:16:17,833
Don't look.
If you look, they'll kill you.

171
00:16:18,119 --> 00:16:20,162
If we look,
he said they'll kill us.

172
00:16:20,366 --> 00:16:21,643
You, get up.

173
00:16:22,302 --> 00:16:23,937
Don't regret it while
watching TV later.

174
00:16:24,081 --> 00:16:26,211
I said, lift your head up!

175
00:16:26,261 --> 00:16:27,937
Move your hands away you bitch.

176
00:16:28,126 --> 00:16:29,124
Move. Move.

177
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:34,104
Open your eyes. Open your eyes.
Open your eyes!

178
00:16:37,765 --> 00:16:38,857
What?

179
00:16:45,014 --> 00:16:46,148
That's it.

180
00:16:46,496 --> 00:16:48,190
That's the way.

181
00:16:50,456 --> 00:16:52,601
They all should be more like you.

182
00:16:52,652 --> 00:16:54,029
Don't you think so brother?

183
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,393
What the fuck's up with him?

184
00:16:58,811 --> 00:17:00,381
Well, well, well.

185
00:17:00,888 --> 00:17:03,581
Leave the ones that love
music and books alone.

186
00:17:03,717 --> 00:17:05,197
Even if that's so...

187
00:17:21,645 --> 00:17:23,973
I'm going to strip search you later.

188
00:17:24,805 --> 00:17:28,382
If I find that you're hiding something,
you'll be sorry.

189
00:18:17,063 --> 00:18:19,129
You're not the only
smart one here brother.

190
00:18:19,216 --> 00:18:21,694
You've now been surpassed.

191
00:18:25,078 --> 00:18:26,076
Stop.

192
00:18:28,225 --> 00:18:31,693
Damn. I just oiled this.
Don't get your spit on here.

193
00:18:32,284 --> 00:18:33,282
Disgusting.

194
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,770
Honestly, I hope he doesn't return.

195
00:18:38,882 --> 00:18:40,307
I heard he stole the guns.

196
00:18:40,677 --> 00:18:42,770
Wasn't he a sniper for the paratroopers?

197
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:46,698
No, he was in the special forces.
Assassinating figures from Pyongyang.

198
00:18:47,461 --> 00:18:50,184
I doubt he'll come to the baths
carrying a gun though.

199
00:18:50,641 --> 00:18:54,715
He's not stupid enough to come to
his regular sauna while we're after him.

200
00:18:54,835 --> 00:18:56,511
I wouldn't be so sure.

201
00:18:56,617 --> 00:18:58,572
You heard what his IQ is.

202
00:19:01,052 --> 00:19:02,855
Ouch.
Be gentler.

203
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:06,388
I just want you to exfoliate me.
Not rip off my skin.

204
00:19:27,796 --> 00:19:30,551
Damn.
I thought they looked alike.

205
00:19:34,163 --> 00:19:36,350
Take it off.
Your pours are open now.

206
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:37,698
Okay.

207
00:19:47,084 --> 00:19:48,954
My muscles are burning.

208
00:19:52,139 --> 00:19:54,317
I've changed baths recently.
What do you think?

209
00:19:54,555 --> 00:19:55,878
Isn't it great here?

210
00:19:56,804 --> 00:19:59,212
Why is there so much
doodling on your body?

211
00:20:01,746 --> 00:20:03,164
These tattoos?

212
00:20:03,822 --> 00:20:07,592
These are nothing. There was even a guy
in the marines who tattooed his dick.

213
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:10,936
It was of a girl.

214
00:20:11,538 --> 00:20:14,266
Usually it looked like a
wrinkly grandma.

215
00:20:14,804 --> 00:20:18,862
But when he got erect
it turned into a tight young woman.

216
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:20,634
Even her eyes opened.

217
00:20:21,378 --> 00:20:22,376
Like this.

218
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,360
Fuck.

219
00:20:34,141 --> 00:20:35,937
Brother, let's rob a bank.

220
00:20:36,098 --> 00:20:37,572
 Or a Mint.

221
00:20:39,543 --> 00:20:43,148
Can't you ask me what I want to do
with the money we steal?

222
00:20:43,696 --> 00:20:45,053
What will you do?

223
00:20:48,107 --> 00:20:49,105
Well...

224
00:20:51,488 --> 00:20:53,657
That's a real hard question to answer.

225
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:59,802
I'm going to bribe a TV producer,
and work for a broadcaster.

226
00:21:01,556 --> 00:21:03,233
And why a broadcaster?

227
00:21:03,974 --> 00:21:06,498
Because getting on TV once
in my life is my dream.

228
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,343
Maybe as a comedian.

229
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:12,304
And what would you do
if you become a comedian?

230
00:21:14,976 --> 00:21:15,974
Make money.

231
00:21:18,651 --> 00:21:20,513
So your reason to make money,

232
00:21:20,775 --> 00:21:22,613
is to make more money.

233
00:21:23,709 --> 00:21:25,306
You think you can make people laugh?

234
00:21:27,448 --> 00:21:29,713
Didn't I tell you that
I got letters of encouragement

235
00:21:29,764 --> 00:21:31,614
after entering a
military talent competition?

236
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:34,659
I have so many good stories.

237
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:38,270
Have you heard the story about
the turtle that jerked off?

238
00:21:39,387 --> 00:21:41,248
When I was younger, I had a turtle.

239
00:21:41,406 --> 00:21:43,434
One day, the baby turtle said
to its mother,

240
00:21:43,498 --> 00:21:45,565
"What's jerking off mean?"

241
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:47,287
I know that one.

242
00:21:48,084 --> 00:21:49,454
Don't you have another joke?

243
00:21:51,722 --> 00:21:53,487
Don't dent my gun.

244
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:56,867
That crazy idiot.

245
00:21:57,259 --> 00:21:59,389
I'm not going to steal anymore.

246
00:22:10,222 --> 00:22:11,591
Have you seen my pager?

247
00:22:37,125 --> 00:22:38,592
Miss Ma Ri-Ah.

248
00:22:39,767 --> 00:22:41,284
Is your surname Ma?

249
00:22:41,805 --> 00:22:42,803
Yes.

250
00:22:43,739 --> 00:22:45,416
You're the only witness
who saw them.

251
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:47,542
Did you take a good look?

252
00:22:47,804 --> 00:22:48,802
Of course.

253
00:22:49,262 --> 00:22:50,670
And what did they look like?

254
00:23:13,494 --> 00:23:15,354
Please give me back my pager.

255
00:23:16,257 --> 00:23:17,445
I don't have it.

256
00:23:17,532 --> 00:23:18,530
What?

257
00:23:19,527 --> 00:23:20,885
A friend has it.

258
00:23:33,379 --> 00:23:34,603
Where is my pager?

259
00:23:36,552 --> 00:23:38,508
If I don't call her by tomorrow,

260
00:23:38,565 --> 00:23:40,827
she will take it to the police.

261
00:23:40,964 --> 00:23:42,936
There are a lot of
numbers on that pager.

262
00:23:43,016 --> 00:23:46,295
If something happens to my kid,
I'm meant to get paged.

263
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:47,905
We've given back your things.

264
00:23:47,936 --> 00:23:49,330
So what more do you want?

265
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,196
You have to go somewhere with me.

266
00:23:57,991 --> 00:23:59,741
What did I tell you.

267
00:24:00,716 --> 00:24:02,153
A bitch like this

268
00:24:03,652 --> 00:24:05,095
talking is useless.

269
00:24:07,403 --> 00:24:11,012
You won't know because
you haven't been in the army,

270
00:24:11,243 --> 00:24:14,419
That thing before,
it's a real gun.

271
00:24:14,736 --> 00:24:19,306
It's known to be a very powerful gun.

272
00:24:19,911 --> 00:24:20,909
I think.

273
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:23,828
To summarise,

274
00:24:24,025 --> 00:24:27,478
I'm not some petty
person that robs empty houses.

275
00:24:27,725 --> 00:24:28,730
You understand?

276
00:24:29,222 --> 00:24:32,199
This is why, these days
you gotta send broads to the army

277
00:24:33,158 --> 00:24:36,113
Let's split it 8 to both of you,
and 2 to me.

278
00:24:36,494 --> 00:24:38,346
The owners of the house
are really wealthy

279
00:24:38,988 --> 00:24:41,095
If you count their wallets,
the safe and cash,

280
00:24:41,468 --> 00:24:44,026
it's more lucrative
than robbing a store.

281
00:24:56,351 --> 00:24:58,413
You think Jazz is the only art?

282
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:02,362
Fuck, what you're doing now is art.

283
00:25:18,943 --> 00:25:20,947
Hey.
Hey!

284
00:25:21,072 --> 00:25:22,934
What the hell are you doing!

285
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:25,431
Who are you people?

286
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:26,485
Us?

287
00:25:26,536 --> 00:25:28,519
Brother.
This is real art right?

288
00:25:29,476 --> 00:25:30,950
When we came in, we were burglars.

289
00:25:31,001 --> 00:25:33,104
But when leaving, we could be robbers.

290
00:25:33,155 --> 00:25:34,640
I think these two are actors.

291
00:25:34,691 --> 00:25:36,105
He could be her teacher.

292
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:37,820
Porno actors.

293
00:25:39,857 --> 00:25:41,097
And how old are you kid?

294
00:25:41,448 --> 00:25:42,446
Seven...

295
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:44,388
Seventeen.

296
00:25:44,714 --> 00:25:46,231
Seventeen you say.

297
00:25:47,105 --> 00:25:51,103
You think this is okay? At your age,
you should be at junior athletic meets.

298
00:25:52,872 --> 00:25:53,870
And you!

299
00:25:54,278 --> 00:25:56,860
She's old enough to be your daughter.
What are you doing?

300
00:25:56,936 --> 00:25:59,512
How many times have you done it?
Tell me!

301
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:03,454
It makes sense when I say
you're old enough to be her father.

302
00:26:03,735 --> 00:26:05,414
Why are you taking off your mask?

303
00:26:06,188 --> 00:26:07,726
- We're fucked.
- <i>Hey, you're...</i>

304
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:09,347
What's going on here?

305
00:26:14,089 --> 00:26:15,095
Where's my child?

306
00:26:15,145 --> 00:26:16,694
<i>That child shouldn't
have been born.</i>

307
00:26:16,745 --> 00:26:18,777
- Child?
- Just tell me where my child is?

308
00:26:20,563 --> 00:26:22,310
There's nothing that
can be done now.

309
00:26:22,488 --> 00:26:23,779
Just tell me where my child is!

310
00:26:23,838 --> 00:26:24,933
"My child?"

311
00:26:24,984 --> 00:26:26,327
The baby is dead.

312
00:26:37,374 --> 00:26:38,372
What are you doing?

313
00:26:38,941 --> 00:26:39,999
- Let go.
- No.

314
00:26:40,071 --> 00:26:41,480
- Get out of the way.
- No I won't.

315
00:26:57,138 --> 00:26:59,201
I'm going to get the videotape.

316
00:26:59,724 --> 00:27:01,401
We've been filmed too.

317
00:27:43,916 --> 00:27:45,206
I know the baby is alive.

318
00:27:45,257 --> 00:27:46,316
Where's the baby?

319
00:28:05,966 --> 00:28:08,308
Teacher, your eyes see me.

320
00:28:09,338 --> 00:28:11,873
But those eyes are of someone

321
00:28:12,252 --> 00:28:14,320
itching to kill me.

322
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:33,125
<i>What time is it?</i>

323
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:34,808
<i>7 a.m.</i>

324
00:28:46,963 --> 00:28:49,440
These incompetents.
It's been daylight for a while.

325
00:28:49,588 --> 00:28:51,916
There's not an ounce of a DIY attitude.

326
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:07,286
Yeah what?

327
00:29:07,337 --> 00:29:08,695
<i>That's my phone.</i>

328
00:29:09,028 --> 00:29:10,705
You called just for that?

329
00:29:11,132 --> 00:29:12,715
You crazy fuck.

330
00:29:12,945 --> 00:29:15,763
My girlfriend saved money
for a year to buy that gift.

331
00:29:16,567 --> 00:29:18,100
If I don't get that back...

332
00:29:18,809 --> 00:29:19,930
I'll be dead soon.

333
00:29:20,102 --> 00:29:22,244
You idiot. Just buy the same phone.

334
00:29:22,295 --> 00:29:25,489
I can't replace that sticker
though you fucking arsehole.

335
00:29:27,581 --> 00:29:29,235
Fine. Fine.

336
00:29:29,506 --> 00:29:31,204
I'll return it
after I use it for a bit.

337
00:29:31,241 --> 00:29:33,754
Don't get too excited.
Go home and rest.

338
00:29:34,237 --> 00:29:36,352
But doesn't it hurt where
I hit you?

339
00:29:36,416 --> 00:29:38,768
It really fucking hurts
you fucking arsehole.

340
00:29:38,858 --> 00:29:41,752
How old are you to
be swearing all the time.

341
00:29:41,764 --> 00:29:43,721
Either way, I'm paying
that phone bill.

342
00:29:44,205 --> 00:29:45,859
You better not make
international calls.

343
00:29:46,263 --> 00:29:47,261
Also,

344
00:29:47,506 --> 00:29:50,438
Use 'collect calling' when phoning
interstate, when you can.

345
00:29:50,613 --> 00:29:53,709
If there's nothing to be done,
use 0-8-2 before calling.

346
00:29:53,845 --> 00:29:54,850
You understand?

347
00:29:55,435 --> 00:29:58,295
Alright. Alright.
Not that expensive anyway.

348
00:29:58,305 --> 00:30:01,115
<i>Just do it you fucking arsehole!</i>

349
00:30:02,876 --> 00:30:05,041
This dickhead.

350
00:30:27,578 --> 00:30:28,616
What's wrong?

351
00:30:29,042 --> 00:30:32,960
My dream was so boring,
I decided to wake up.

352
00:30:51,134 --> 00:30:52,654
<i>What did they look like?</i>

353
00:30:53,861 --> 00:30:55,036
The small guy...

354
00:30:55,628 --> 00:30:58,306
had short legs and red socks.

355
00:31:00,102 --> 00:31:02,498
He had beady eyes.

356
00:31:04,627 --> 00:31:06,526
He was very clumsy.

357
00:31:07,158 --> 00:31:08,459
And the tall one...

358
00:31:09,171 --> 00:31:11,745
He had slanted eyebrows and tired eyes.

359
00:31:16,156 --> 00:31:18,633
<i>Whenever he opened his mouth,
a lot of spit came out. </i>

360
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,641
You're not getting out?

361
00:31:46,675 --> 00:31:51,059
You know where I hate
going most in the world?

362
00:31:51,361 --> 00:31:54,702
Do you always have to make
it obvious that you were an orphan?

363
00:31:56,699 --> 00:32:00,104
It's not like you grew up in
a harmonious household.

364
00:32:00,184 --> 00:32:02,722
Anyway, all humans are orphans buddy.

365
00:32:03,356 --> 00:32:05,086
Because God has discarded us.

366
00:32:07,537 --> 00:32:09,214
I don't know about any god,

367
00:32:10,002 --> 00:32:12,742
but what I know is that
my mother discarded me.

368
00:32:20,875 --> 00:32:21,879
You want to die?

369
00:32:21,929 --> 00:32:23,199
This is our turf.

370
00:32:24,537 --> 00:32:27,151
We're busy kid, so go over there,
chew some gum and play.

371
00:32:28,108 --> 00:32:29,306
Move your car.

372
00:32:31,382 --> 00:32:33,757
There's a lot of space here.
What's the matter?

373
00:32:33,984 --> 00:32:35,553
Could you play somewhere else please?

374
00:32:35,671 --> 00:32:37,533
You go somewhere else lady.

375
00:32:38,008 --> 00:32:39,206
Why I oughta...

376
00:32:40,592 --> 00:32:42,189
Just wait a moment.

377
00:32:46,577 --> 00:32:47,934
Do you live here?

378
00:32:48,856 --> 00:32:50,186
Don't you have a mother?

379
00:32:50,284 --> 00:32:51,903
For fuck's sake.

380
00:33:02,863 --> 00:33:03,871
Hey kid,

381
00:33:03,922 --> 00:33:05,173
where's the director's office?

382
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:07,494
It's over there.

383
00:33:08,847 --> 00:33:09,845
<i>Thank you.</i>

384
00:33:36,174 --> 00:33:37,251
So,

385
00:33:37,592 --> 00:33:39,268
first, write an application,

386
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:41,964
then until it's approved,
visiting will be possible.

387
00:33:43,091 --> 00:33:44,095
Well,

388
00:33:44,308 --> 00:33:47,294
She's wanting to take her baby,
so what's this about visiting?

389
00:33:47,345 --> 00:33:48,483
You fucking arsehole.

390
00:33:48,594 --> 00:33:49,592
Fucking arsehole?

391
00:33:49,929 --> 00:33:51,253
You orphan bastard.

392
00:33:51,421 --> 00:33:52,656
How dare you cause a scene!

393
00:33:52,707 --> 00:33:53,725
What are you doing?

394
00:33:54,827 --> 00:33:56,617
You're lucky Pigface.

395
00:34:04,136 --> 00:34:05,142
God.

396
00:34:10,662 --> 00:34:13,236
As I was saying before,

397
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:16,848
you should adhere to this
rightful legal process.

398
00:34:17,116 --> 00:34:20,775
We can't give this child to just anyone.

399
00:34:33,285 --> 00:34:35,802
Is the mother of this child
just 'anyone'?

400
00:35:24,516 --> 00:35:26,845
Why are there so many
people giving up babies?

401
00:35:28,493 --> 00:35:30,401
Should I just raise this
one myself?

402
00:35:32,901 --> 00:35:35,205
All humans are orphans anyway.

403
00:35:38,057 --> 00:35:39,337
Have a nice day.

404
00:35:48,664 --> 00:35:49,942
It's just a toy.

405
00:35:50,136 --> 00:35:51,357
<i>Robbers!</i>

406
00:35:53,982 --> 00:35:55,879
They're robbers. Robbers!

407
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:01,407
We're police. Put your hands up.

408
00:36:01,457 --> 00:36:03,254
I'm...I'm a mother.

409
00:36:03,305 --> 00:36:04,687
Put your hands up.

410
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:20,030
Where did our bikes go?

411
00:36:20,866 --> 00:36:23,197
Hey kid.
Have you seen our motorbikes?

412
00:36:29,564 --> 00:36:31,831
Tell the baby to be quiet.

413
00:36:32,754 --> 00:36:35,033
Why is she crying?
She's met her mother.

414
00:36:36,671 --> 00:36:39,287
She must be hungry.
But she's not sucking on my breast.

415
00:36:40,012 --> 00:36:41,369
What are we to do...

416
00:36:43,841 --> 00:36:46,199
She's probably had powdered milk,
so won't want breast milk.

417
00:36:49,534 --> 00:36:52,125
Why isn't she sucking on
such a great thing.

418
00:36:53,113 --> 00:36:55,975
Me, I can't understand it at all.

419
00:37:10,964 --> 00:37:16,073
<i>This Mr Elephant's nose are his hands.</i>

420
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:22,803
<i>When you give him a snack,
he eats it with his nose.</i>

421
00:37:23,077 --> 00:37:24,939
Why did you steal this too?

422
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:28,488
When my daughter
sees me playing the saxophone,

423
00:37:28,654 --> 00:37:31,102
she thinks it looks like
an elephant's nose.

424
00:37:31,556 --> 00:37:34,215
That's why she loves
elephant stuffed toys.

425
00:38:11,524 --> 00:38:13,782
Don't be like that.
Just give it to me one time.

426
00:38:13,822 --> 00:38:15,499
I even found your child.

427
00:38:15,794 --> 00:38:18,526
In good conscious, shouldn't you
be giving me something like this?

428
00:38:20,291 --> 00:38:21,303
Just once.

429
00:38:21,857 --> 00:38:25,161
C'mon, let's just do it.
Just this once.

430
00:38:28,496 --> 00:38:29,517
What you glaring at?

431
00:38:30,622 --> 00:38:33,559
You think if you glare at me like that,
I won't be able to stick it in?

432
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:35,721
What are you going to stick in,
you idiot.

433
00:39:18,456 --> 00:39:19,454
Hey!

434
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:25,957
Are you a person!

435
00:39:26,591 --> 00:39:28,045
How can you do this to me!

436
00:39:29,899 --> 00:39:32,227
Just take it easy.
It's not what you think.

437
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:37,886
If a baby doesn't breast feed,
the breast can get stiff and painful.

438
00:39:37,918 --> 00:39:39,945
If not careful, women can get mastitis.

439
00:39:40,087 --> 00:39:41,703
- Therefore...
- That's why?

440
00:39:42,117 --> 00:39:44,262
That's why Ma Ri-Ah
asked me for this favour.

441
00:39:46,046 --> 00:39:47,048
Ma Ri-Ah.

442
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,594
Let's do the left one now.

443
00:39:57,618 --> 00:39:58,617
Mastitis...

444
00:40:14,719 --> 00:40:16,391
Me too. Me too.

445
00:40:17,452 --> 00:40:18,490
Hear me out.

446
00:40:20,267 --> 00:40:25,194
If we suck each breast,
it would be quicker. Right?

447
00:40:55,169 --> 00:40:58,220
70 cents plus 45 cents,

448
00:40:58,577 --> 00:40:59,741
times three.

449
00:41:02,542 --> 00:41:04,604
That will be 5 dollars and 55 cents.

450
00:41:04,891 --> 00:41:06,650
Wait a minute.
Why is it so expensive?

451
00:41:07,367 --> 00:41:10,782
70 cents times three.
Isn't that 2 dollars and 10 cents?

452
00:41:11,036 --> 00:41:14,260
It's 18 dollars and 50 cents
times three.

453
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:17,717
That will be 5 dollars and 55 cents.

454
00:41:18,161 --> 00:41:19,673
What times three?

455
00:41:19,777 --> 00:41:23,628
Like I said, It's 18 dollars
and 50 cents times three.

456
00:41:24,103 --> 00:41:27,613
Why are you charging $18.50
when the sign says 70 cents?

457
00:41:28,567 --> 00:41:31,622
That says the coffee price is 70 cents.

458
00:41:31,799 --> 00:41:34,269
Then the cup price is 45 cents.

459
00:41:34,407 --> 00:41:37,493
But in those cups,
the capacity is 2 cups of coffee.

460
00:41:37,727 --> 00:41:39,315
So I'm right.

461
00:41:39,538 --> 00:41:40,615
Fine then.

462
00:41:40,666 --> 00:41:42,215
So let's say 6 cups of coffee,

463
00:41:42,353 --> 00:41:44,501
then 6 times 7
equals 4 dollars 20 cents.

464
00:41:44,552 --> 00:41:46,379
But charging for cups,
what's that about?

465
00:41:47,164 --> 00:41:48,502
Isn't 6 times 7 isn't 47?

466
00:41:48,977 --> 00:41:50,610
Just stay out of this you idiot.

467
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:52,733
Mister, just stay out of this.

468
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:56,100
Miss. You seem not to know,

469
00:41:56,379 --> 00:41:58,446
but these 'Slushy' cups

470
00:41:58,784 --> 00:42:00,934
are expensive to begin with.

471
00:42:01,149 --> 00:42:03,184
And also, in our business,

472
00:42:03,235 --> 00:42:07,454
we see how many of these cups
are used, then calculate the price.

473
00:42:07,505 --> 00:42:08,825
You understand now?

474
00:42:08,876 --> 00:42:09,879
Brother,

475
00:42:10,273 --> 00:42:11,598
'slush' is English right?

476
00:42:14,733 --> 00:42:15,731
That's right.

477
00:42:15,782 --> 00:42:18,306
2 times 9 is 18 you arsehole.

478
00:42:18,602 --> 00:42:21,634
So you're saying that this
piece of shit cup is 45 cents each?

479
00:42:21,911 --> 00:42:22,910
Ridiculous.

480
00:42:23,241 --> 00:42:25,088
Bring out the manager you arsehole.

481
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:26,656
<i>What?</i>

482
00:42:26,853 --> 00:42:30,151
What? 'Arse..bitch...'
What did you say?'

483
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:32,972
You prick, do you have
a death wish?

484
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:35,040
Prick, I'm the manager!
Now what?

485
00:42:35,411 --> 00:42:37,544
You really want to die, don't you?

486
00:42:43,384 --> 00:42:45,041
This is hilarious.

487
00:42:45,752 --> 00:42:47,497
Stop talking shit.

488
00:43:21,328 --> 00:43:23,841
Many people are going home for
New Year's Day.

489
00:43:26,981 --> 00:43:30,368
Fuck, if they loved their hometown
so much, why did they leave.

490
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:34,832
Let's go to my hometown.

491
00:43:37,295 --> 00:43:38,787
Where's your hometown?

492
00:43:48,264 --> 00:43:50,462
Ah, my hometown smell

493
00:43:50,513 --> 00:43:51,741
's like shit.

494
00:43:54,743 --> 00:43:57,398
<i>Isn't the day too nice to
be so poor.</i>

495
00:44:00,558 --> 00:44:02,483
I'll stop giving the baby
powdered milk.

496
00:44:03,926 --> 00:44:06,840
After a couple of days, the
baby will have to have breast milk.

497
00:44:12,064 --> 00:44:15,874
Do you know the feeling of a mother
who can't breastfeed her child?

498
00:44:16,339 --> 00:44:18,098
Being breastfed is so
important for a baby.

499
00:44:20,454 --> 00:44:23,438
I thought that someday,
I would hold my baby in my arms,

500
00:44:23,626 --> 00:44:24,624
and look into her eyes,

501
00:44:24,675 --> 00:44:25,966
I waited for that day.

502
00:44:26,017 --> 00:44:27,017
Her 100th day.

503
00:44:28,398 --> 00:44:29,403
That's right.

504
00:44:30,424 --> 00:44:32,357
You said, it's the
baby's 100th day anniversary.

505
00:44:42,768 --> 00:44:45,089
Make sure you write it's
the baby's 100th day anniversary.

506
00:44:48,891 --> 00:44:49,889
What you think?

507
00:44:50,284 --> 00:44:51,476
Don't I look like him?

508
00:45:10,743 --> 00:45:13,393
Okay. Let's quickly shoot
while the baby's in a good mood.

509
00:45:13,444 --> 00:45:14,442
Assemble!

510
00:45:27,247 --> 00:45:28,847
Please look to the front.

511
00:45:29,701 --> 00:45:31,200
Hey Moustache! Not so close.

512
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:34,275
Look at me and smile!

513
00:45:41,203 --> 00:45:42,201
<i>Thank you.</i>

514
00:45:45,619 --> 00:45:47,616
<i>I feel like a real mother now.</i>

515
00:45:50,908 --> 00:45:54,433
<i>Did my mother have my 100th day
party before dumping me?</i>

516
00:45:56,076 --> 00:45:57,896
<i>If she were in circumstances to
have a party,</i>

517
00:45:58,135 --> 00:45:59,775
<i>you think she could abandon a child?</i>

518
00:46:03,407 --> 00:46:04,680
<i>And what did you do Brother?</i>

519
00:46:07,575 --> 00:46:09,124
<i>For my kid's 100th day party,</i>

520
00:46:09,558 --> 00:46:10,823
<i>I was in jail.</i>

521
00:46:22,842 --> 00:46:25,148
 Cheese.

522
00:46:31,511 --> 00:46:33,524
You trying to make your kid
into a chain smoker?

523
00:46:35,469 --> 00:46:36,880
This is my last one.

524
00:46:38,589 --> 00:46:40,328
Brother, have you quit smoking?

525
00:46:40,397 --> 00:46:41,762
I haven't seen you smoke recently.

526
00:46:41,813 --> 00:46:43,663
Smoking is a slow suicide.

527
00:46:44,659 --> 00:46:45,657
Oh, suicide?

528
00:46:46,247 --> 00:46:48,219
That must mean you have to smoke a
fuck ton then.

529
00:46:48,286 --> 00:46:50,379
A life has to burn bright.

530
00:46:51,523 --> 00:46:53,309
Anyway, you are a fearful person.

531
00:46:54,424 --> 00:46:57,020
You always say you will kill
yourself but you can't.

532
00:46:57,596 --> 00:46:59,234
It's all because of that.

533
00:46:59,411 --> 00:47:00,463
Crazy fool.

534
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:02,886
Okay, let's say goodbye now.

535
00:47:03,978 --> 00:47:05,921
Don't live in an
orphanage again kid.

536
00:47:06,126 --> 00:47:07,782
We were fortunate to
find your kid again,

537
00:47:07,845 --> 00:47:08,852
so raise her right.

538
00:47:10,445 --> 00:47:12,375
What do you mean by all that?

539
00:47:12,925 --> 00:47:14,692
We're going to the next job.

540
00:47:14,826 --> 00:47:16,371
And you're going to go
raise your kid.

541
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:18,839
Bye.

542
00:47:20,812 --> 00:47:22,749
You think you can raise a kid for free?

543
00:47:23,063 --> 00:47:24,317
Take me with you.

544
00:47:28,665 --> 00:47:31,157
<i>Let's say at the very least,
we rob a convenience store.</i>

545
00:47:31,369 --> 00:47:33,683
<i>One person takes the
customers and staff.</i>

546
00:47:33,827 --> 00:47:35,744
<i>One goes to the cash register.</i>

547
00:47:36,165 --> 00:47:37,920
<i>Then who's on lookout?</i>

548
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:40,669
<i>If the cops swarm in,
you wouldn't know.</i>

549
00:47:41,449 --> 00:47:43,414
<i>Let's say that's the case
for convenience stores.</i>

550
00:47:43,606 --> 00:47:44,808
<i>What about banks?</i>

551
00:47:45,023 --> 00:47:47,906
<i>One person for the security guards,
and one to collect the money.</i>

552
00:47:48,575 --> 00:47:52,457
<i>And then when a cop storms,
you get into a firefight. Then what?</i>

553
00:47:52,734 --> 00:47:53,788
Well, well, well.

554
00:47:54,264 --> 00:47:56,616
Look at these audacious fools.

555
00:47:57,829 --> 00:48:01,053
How could you rob
a bank with only two people?

556
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:15,973
<i>Should I go on?</i>

557
00:48:16,045 --> 00:48:17,383
<i>Stop it!</i>

558
00:48:18,793 --> 00:48:21,329
Why are you suddenly wanting
to rob a place like that?

559
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:24,054
Our objective are banks!
Banks! Banks!

560
00:48:26,059 --> 00:48:28,587
There's always an order to things.

561
00:48:29,959 --> 00:48:32,172
You need to put underwear
on first before your pants.

562
00:48:33,868 --> 00:48:36,260
Are you saying we should
rob an underwear shop?

563
00:48:36,561 --> 00:48:38,035
This idiot.

564
00:48:40,066 --> 00:48:42,063
<i>Firstly, it's a cash business.</i>

565
00:48:42,891 --> 00:48:46,270
<i>Secondly, Saturday and Sunday sales
are always kept in the safe.</i>

566
00:48:46,444 --> 00:48:48,544
<i>Thirdly, security is low.</i>

567
00:48:49,393 --> 00:48:53,234
Something definitely is in there,
seeing these men struggle so much.

568
00:48:56,025 --> 00:48:57,087
Here.

569
00:48:57,137 --> 00:49:00,374
What did I say, don't
look over that way.

570
00:49:02,345 --> 00:49:03,511
What should we do brother?

571
00:49:05,009 --> 00:49:06,007
Lay it down.

572
00:49:12,411 --> 00:49:15,253
Go over there and
put your heads to the floor.

573
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:21,606
Now it's time to show us
your skills, Brother.

574
00:49:27,469 --> 00:49:28,468
What's that?

575
00:49:39,636 --> 00:49:40,896
Is this a specialist skill too?

576
00:49:42,649 --> 00:49:43,860
I could do that too.

577
00:49:44,677 --> 00:49:48,127
You start at the simplest
place when cracking safes.

578
00:49:49,685 --> 00:49:50,683
Take note.

579
00:49:51,507 --> 00:49:53,185
These models of safes

580
00:49:54,685 --> 00:49:56,696
 have a weak back plate.

581
00:50:03,604 --> 00:50:04,602
What's this?

582
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:07,293
You had a lot of customers before.

583
00:50:08,414 --> 00:50:11,326
We had a lot of invited guests,
so there won't be a lot of cash.

584
00:50:13,179 --> 00:50:15,254
<i>But you have two cinemas here.</i>

585
00:50:16,692 --> 00:50:19,199
One cinema is for art films.

586
00:50:31,811 --> 00:50:33,541
Thank you very very much.

587
00:50:33,602 --> 00:50:38,125
The golden bell was rung
on table eight.

588
00:50:39,062 --> 00:50:44,896
Which means, what you've drank
until now will be paid by the table.

589
00:50:49,941 --> 00:50:53,857
<i>Also, we will have a special
performance from table 8 as well.</i>

590
00:50:53,908 --> 00:50:55,638
<i>Please come to the stage.</i>

591
00:50:56,597 --> 00:50:57,595
A round of applause.

592
00:51:16,510 --> 00:51:20,072
I have a younger brother.

593
00:51:25,498 --> 00:51:28,145
<i>We met at the 'Beehive Club' Cabaret.</i>

594
00:51:30,403 --> 00:51:33,992
<i>There, I was playing alto saxophone
in the band.</i>

595
00:51:35,292 --> 00:51:36,290
<i>And he was</i>

596
00:51:37,438 --> 00:51:38,466
<i>a tout.</i>

597
00:51:41,225 --> 00:51:43,079
<i>From the first moment we met,</i>

598
00:51:44,759 --> 00:51:46,436
<i>how should I say this,</i>

599
00:51:47,992 --> 00:51:51,098
<i>there was electricity between us.</i>

600
00:51:54,259 --> 00:51:55,265
And he's sitting...

601
00:51:55,918 --> 00:51:57,198
right there.

602
00:52:05,154 --> 00:52:08,093
<i>To be honest, I never
wanted to perform again.</i>

603
00:52:08,977 --> 00:52:12,195
<i>But for his family,
I want to perform.</i>

604
00:52:47,641 --> 00:52:48,640
Hey Ma Ri-Ah.

605
00:52:50,242 --> 00:52:52,325
Do you really not want to give <i>it</i> to me?

606
00:52:54,122 --> 00:52:55,121
In that case,

607
00:52:55,997 --> 00:52:56,995
what if we do this.

608
00:52:57,806 --> 00:52:59,979
You can have me. I'll give you
my body.

609
00:53:33,583 --> 00:53:35,263
Oh that stupid bitch.

610
00:53:35,602 --> 00:53:38,066
She's learnt something
important today.

611
00:53:38,667 --> 00:53:39,667
Isn't that right?

612
00:53:43,623 --> 00:53:45,243
Let's get some ramen.

613
00:53:46,259 --> 00:53:48,743
<i>We're nearly at the hotel.
Let's just eat there.</i>

614
00:53:50,430 --> 00:53:51,437
You're not eating?

615
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:53,085
Nope.

616
00:53:53,214 --> 00:53:55,224
<i>I'll just sleep here with the baby.</i>

617
00:53:55,637 --> 00:53:56,635
You do that then.

618
00:53:59,965 --> 00:54:01,403
You're not eating?

619
00:54:02,547 --> 00:54:04,881
<i>If you drink then have ramen,
you gain weight.</i>

620
00:54:18,173 --> 00:54:20,632
I'm starving. I can't resist.

621
00:54:23,619 --> 00:54:25,489
- Where's the baby?
- The baby?

622
00:54:26,767 --> 00:54:27,765
She's sleeping soundly.

623
00:54:35,301 --> 00:54:36,949
Stop you thieves!

624
00:54:37,554 --> 00:54:38,552
We've been robbed!

625
00:55:34,231 --> 00:55:35,358
It's all my fault.

626
00:55:36,019 --> 00:55:37,017
Shoot.

627
00:55:46,416 --> 00:55:50,116
Do something. She says she's going
to find the baby herself.

628
00:55:53,953 --> 00:55:56,312
Fuck. How did I fuck this up.

629
00:56:03,009 --> 00:56:04,118
Hey Ma Ri-Ah. Wait.

630
00:56:04,830 --> 00:56:06,597
We'll find the baby for you.

631
00:56:06,996 --> 00:56:08,048
Right Brother?

632
00:56:09,330 --> 00:56:12,659
- Just relax and have a cigarette.
- Get lost.

633
00:56:13,559 --> 00:56:15,888
Because all I want is to kill you.

634
00:56:28,034 --> 00:56:29,032
Brother.

635
00:56:31,810 --> 00:56:33,087
Wait in the car.

636
00:56:37,028 --> 00:56:38,337
Yeah, that's probably better.

637
00:56:39,118 --> 00:56:40,236
Hey Ma Ri-Ah.

638
00:56:40,518 --> 00:56:44,470
Listen to what he says.
I'll wait in the car, okay?

639
00:56:52,451 --> 00:56:54,994
I think I've done enough
finding your baby once.

640
00:56:55,056 --> 00:56:57,586
I can't always take
responsibility for you and your daughter.

641
00:56:58,831 --> 00:56:59,829
Just leave.

642
00:57:00,525 --> 00:57:02,566
I'm going to go my separate
ways with him too.

643
00:57:07,592 --> 00:57:09,514
Because I've had a realisation.

644
00:57:12,915 --> 00:57:14,911
Music, I can't give up yet.

645
00:57:27,343 --> 00:57:28,940
Where is this place?

646
00:57:30,067 --> 00:57:31,598
Where are we going?

647
00:57:35,432 --> 00:57:36,430
Brother!

648
00:57:43,448 --> 00:57:45,143
I'm here to collect something.

649
00:58:02,068 --> 00:58:04,075
Wait a minute.
Go back.

650
00:58:04,281 --> 00:58:05,841
What's wrong?

651
00:58:44,533 --> 00:58:46,391
- You thug.
- Put your hands up.

652
00:58:48,083 --> 00:58:49,157
You okay?

653
00:58:51,742 --> 00:58:53,229
<i>Brother, I said are you okay?</i>

654
00:58:53,514 --> 00:58:54,647
I'm okay.

655
00:58:57,745 --> 00:58:59,915
Fuck, what kind of granny is this?

656
00:59:00,153 --> 00:59:01,670
Put that down.
Now!

657
00:59:02,076 --> 00:59:04,633
You think I haven't been
fooled by a toy gun before?

658
00:59:04,684 --> 00:59:06,281
You have no chance.

659
00:59:07,552 --> 00:59:10,861
This is real.
You'll die really well if you get shot.

660
00:59:12,182 --> 00:59:14,379
If you don't scram,
I'm going to shoot again.

661
00:59:15,069 --> 00:59:16,155
Look at this old bat.

662
00:59:16,225 --> 00:59:17,445
Don't you watch TV these days?

663
00:59:17,496 --> 00:59:19,482
You haven't heard of the
armed robbers 'the Trio'?

664
00:59:19,533 --> 00:59:20,647
I don't watch the news!

665
00:59:21,177 --> 00:59:23,640
In Korea, only 'the Trio' carry guns.

666
00:59:23,691 --> 00:59:25,559
What trio?
There's only two of you!

667
00:59:28,158 --> 00:59:29,156
I mean...

668
00:59:30,245 --> 00:59:32,303
We were previously three.

669
00:59:32,970 --> 00:59:34,388
But Ma Ri-Ah has left.

670
00:59:37,838 --> 00:59:38,943
Drop the gun!

671
00:59:39,830 --> 00:59:41,994
You say it's a fake,
so why are telling me to drop it!

672
00:59:47,906 --> 00:59:48,911
You see.

673
00:59:49,418 --> 00:59:50,416
It's real.

674
00:59:52,761 --> 00:59:53,799
Are you okay?

675
00:59:55,004 --> 00:59:56,003
Move.

676
01:00:00,246 --> 01:00:01,546
Give me my saxophone.

677
01:00:04,293 --> 01:00:05,825
- I sold it.
- What?

678
01:00:07,069 --> 01:00:09,057
This says you couldn't sell it yet!

679
01:00:10,954 --> 01:00:12,797
I told you.
I thought it was stolen

680
01:00:14,924 --> 01:00:17,879
Take one from over there.
There are a lot of horns.

681
01:00:28,635 --> 01:00:29,633
Relax.

682
01:00:32,764 --> 01:00:34,085
You going to kill an old person?

683
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:37,738
Get the money.
I said, get the money!

684
01:00:44,568 --> 01:00:45,965
<i>No you can't!</i>

685
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:48,658
<i>You don't know how hard
I worked for the money.</i>

686
01:00:48,709 --> 01:00:49,751
<i>Be quiet!</i>

687
01:01:09,994 --> 01:01:12,762
There will be no more
scenes without tears.

688
01:01:56,282 --> 01:01:57,280
<i>Run!</i>

689
01:02:54,129 --> 01:02:55,806
Those sons of bitches!
Run!

690
01:03:37,173 --> 01:03:39,089
I'm tired. Should we just fight?

691
01:03:40,995 --> 01:03:42,781
No we'll get caught.

692
01:03:43,774 --> 01:03:47,074
Then what do we do?
My stomach hurts. I can't run anymore.

693
01:03:47,710 --> 01:03:48,988
Just follow me.

694
01:04:46,744 --> 01:04:47,743
Hey.

695
01:04:48,575 --> 01:04:50,096
Are you okay?

696
01:04:51,222 --> 01:04:52,220
Hey!

697
01:05:21,581 --> 01:05:22,619
Are you okay?

698
01:05:24,249 --> 01:05:25,926
Get a hold of yourself.

699
01:05:26,860 --> 01:05:28,537
- Get a hold of yourself.
<i>- Hey Mister!</i>

700
01:05:49,089 --> 01:05:50,766
You fucking arseholes.

701
01:06:02,944 --> 01:06:04,221
How's your head?

702
01:06:06,075 --> 01:06:08,471
My head has always been really hard.

703
01:06:10,117 --> 01:06:12,174
I'm worried because you don't have
external wounds.

704
01:06:13,336 --> 01:06:17,657
Later, if you feel drowsy or
you bleed from your ears, tell me.

705
01:06:18,709 --> 01:06:20,335
Because then it will be
really serious.

706
01:06:27,502 --> 01:06:28,500
What's wrong?

707
01:06:28,759 --> 01:06:30,126
Are you getting drowsy?

708
01:06:30,443 --> 01:06:34,776
This is the first time in my life,
someone's cared about me.

709
01:06:45,261 --> 01:06:46,354
What are you doing?

710
01:07:01,916 --> 01:07:02,937
Is this the right one?

711
01:07:07,781 --> 01:07:09,847
They're quick.
Get in.

712
01:07:13,858 --> 01:07:15,295
It stinks in here.

713
01:07:15,585 --> 01:07:18,395
Out of all things,
why did you steal a garbage truck.

714
01:08:16,527 --> 01:08:18,430
Do you believe in God?

715
01:08:33,348 --> 01:08:34,347
A little bit.

716
01:08:36,248 --> 01:08:39,298
This table will be perfect to play
cards and drink soju.

717
01:08:40,176 --> 01:08:41,174
Good carpet here too.

718
01:08:48,249 --> 01:08:49,247
Hey lady.

719
01:08:50,110 --> 01:08:52,020
Is there a TV or a deck of cards here?

720
01:08:53,335 --> 01:08:55,466
We don't have such things.

721
01:08:56,852 --> 01:08:57,923
Whatever then.

722
01:08:59,645 --> 01:09:01,217
No convenience store here?

723
01:09:02,197 --> 01:09:03,998
You should have gone to a hospital.

724
01:09:04,049 --> 01:09:06,794
You'd find a doctor, TV,
and store all there.

725
01:09:08,064 --> 01:09:10,328
And you can play cards in the mortuary.

726
01:09:10,918 --> 01:09:11,985
Is that so?

727
01:09:15,581 --> 01:09:16,598
You want my phone?

728
01:09:21,135 --> 01:09:22,604
Do you know Ma Ri-Ah well?

729
01:09:25,079 --> 01:09:28,046
You think I could become a nun
without knowing Ma Ri-Ah.

730
01:09:30,817 --> 01:09:31,815
I guess.

731
01:09:41,099 --> 01:09:42,097
Honey?

732
01:09:42,289 --> 01:09:44,890
- Is something wrong with our daughter?
- She's sick.

733
01:09:45,555 --> 01:09:48,154
Even the hospital
doesn't know what's wrong.

734
01:09:48,707 --> 01:09:51,627
I don't know. She keeps
asking for you.

735
01:09:52,285 --> 01:09:55,858
<i>Darling.
I miss you too. Come back quickly.</i>

736
01:09:56,499 --> 01:09:58,172
Put whoever is next to you
on the phone.

737
01:09:58,688 --> 01:10:00,628
Put on the men sent by
Bong-Pal!

738
01:10:01,158 --> 01:10:02,616
Did Bong-Pal send you?

739
01:10:05,659 --> 01:10:06,657
I'll go.

740
01:10:07,853 --> 01:10:09,454
Just don't lay a hand
on my daughter.

741
01:10:09,586 --> 01:10:12,314
My interest is not in you.

742
01:10:13,316 --> 01:10:15,142
For my boss, the guns are important.

743
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:19,500
And to me, that arsehole that
killed my brother is important.

744
01:10:20,879 --> 01:10:22,796
So, if you do as I say,

745
01:10:23,478 --> 01:10:26,073
I won't even touch a hair
on your daughter.

746
01:10:26,779 --> 01:10:27,777
Of course,

747
01:10:28,357 --> 01:10:29,893
even the hairs of your wife

748
01:10:31,945 --> 01:10:33,623
If you arrive alone,

749
01:10:34,048 --> 01:10:37,438
then, you could see this house
go up in flames.

750
01:10:42,478 --> 01:10:45,878
"He that is without sin among you,
let him first cast a stone at her".

751
01:10:45,929 --> 01:10:47,573
There are these words in the bible.

752
01:10:47,731 --> 01:10:48,730
My dear.

753
01:10:49,528 --> 01:10:52,699
Those words don't fit this situation.

754
01:10:54,425 --> 01:10:57,181
And also, those people are men.

755
01:11:01,015 --> 01:11:02,013
Actually...

756
01:11:03,407 --> 01:11:06,751
Can you tell me why
you abruptly left us then?

757
01:11:07,996 --> 01:11:09,834
I was pregnant.

758
01:11:11,023 --> 01:11:12,775
I only found out while I was here.

759
01:11:14,403 --> 01:11:15,401
However...

760
01:11:16,872 --> 01:11:19,185
It's fortunate you found out
during your training period.

761
01:11:19,706 --> 01:11:21,064
Who's the father?

762
01:11:44,453 --> 01:11:45,451
Hey Mister.

763
01:11:46,561 --> 01:11:48,375
Who? Me?

764
01:11:50,063 --> 01:11:51,062
Put it out.

765
01:11:52,171 --> 01:11:53,169
This?

766
01:12:02,317 --> 01:12:05,519
As Ma Ri-Ah asked a favour,
I'll give you some time.

767
01:12:05,989 --> 01:12:09,124
I'll report you at exactly midnight.
So leave by then.

768
01:12:11,929 --> 01:12:14,202
When our saviour was on the cross,

769
01:12:15,486 --> 01:12:17,759
two robbers were crucified next to him.

770
01:12:18,277 --> 01:12:19,503
The robber to the left,

771
01:12:19,686 --> 01:12:22,323
blasphemed against Christ until
the end and was abandoned.

772
01:12:22,568 --> 01:12:23,714
But the robber on the right,

773
01:12:24,175 --> 01:12:26,250
repented and was given salvation.

774
01:12:31,288 --> 01:12:34,283
You...
You told them we were robbers?

775
01:12:36,976 --> 01:12:38,482
Brother, we've been exposed.

776
01:12:42,855 --> 01:12:44,947
Where has this guy gone.

777
01:12:47,886 --> 01:12:48,933
What's this?

778
01:12:50,442 --> 01:12:54,345
- Is this where you take a dump?
- No, it's where you dump your sins.

779
01:13:01,169 --> 01:13:03,012
Brother, are you dumping your sins?

780
01:13:04,893 --> 01:13:05,891
What wrong?

781
01:13:06,258 --> 01:13:08,667
That's where you confess your sins.

782
01:13:13,977 --> 01:13:16,867
It's somewhere that has
nothing to do with me.

783
01:13:18,281 --> 01:13:19,360
Wait a minute.

784
01:13:21,048 --> 01:13:22,268
Have I sinned?

785
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:24,399
Have I?

786
01:13:24,909 --> 01:13:26,111
Have I sinned?

787
01:13:27,743 --> 01:13:28,804
Oh Sin.

788
01:13:31,970 --> 01:13:33,008
No I haven't.

789
01:13:39,923 --> 01:13:43,306
Leaving a baby in the car,
does that count as forgivable?

790
01:13:44,010 --> 01:13:45,026
Shut the door.

791
01:13:46,408 --> 01:13:47,406
What?

792
01:13:47,457 --> 01:13:49,853
I said, close the door you arsehole!

793
01:13:51,249 --> 01:13:53,898
Do you know who took the baby
and the money?

794
01:13:56,741 --> 01:13:58,098
If I knew that...

795
01:14:02,262 --> 01:14:03,939
You think I'd be here.

796
01:14:05,178 --> 01:14:09,863
When we went into the convenience store,
Ma Ri-Ah and a women made eye contact.

797
01:14:09,914 --> 01:14:11,591
She wore a red dress.

798
01:14:12,979 --> 01:14:14,496
She stole the car.

799
01:14:15,151 --> 01:14:18,346
Ma Ri-Ah purposely left
the ignition on in the car.

800
01:14:20,438 --> 01:14:22,308
I only put it together later.

801
01:14:23,489 --> 01:14:26,499
She worked together with
Ma Ri-Ah at the cafe.

802
01:14:32,089 --> 01:14:33,767
So what you're saying is...

803
01:14:34,018 --> 01:14:37,998
The one who stole Ma Ri-Ah's
baby is Ma Ri-Ah.

804
01:14:38,909 --> 01:14:39,907
No way.

805
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:43,275
Can't you use that thing
attached to your neck for once.

806
01:14:43,382 --> 01:14:45,636
You don't remember her
shooting at your dense head.

807
01:14:47,739 --> 01:14:51,031
If she had the money,
you think she'd be back here?

808
01:14:51,245 --> 01:14:54,985
Her kid she can pick back up from the
orphanage. She's been double-crossed.

809
01:14:58,147 --> 01:15:01,892
When we said goodbye, they
probably were meeting at the bus stop.

810
01:15:04,435 --> 01:15:05,774
But her friend disappeared.

811
01:15:06,310 --> 01:15:07,435
With just the money.

812
01:15:15,164 --> 01:15:16,681
What are you doing?

813
01:15:17,784 --> 01:15:19,648
Why are you packing the bag?

814
01:15:19,843 --> 01:15:20,841
Brother!

815
01:15:22,062 --> 01:15:24,352
Do something. He's going to leave.

816
01:15:24,409 --> 01:15:25,407
Brother.

817
01:15:26,746 --> 01:15:28,838
Shouldn't you listen what
Ma Ri-Ah has to say too?

818
01:15:29,567 --> 01:15:31,239
You can't go by yourself.

819
01:15:32,007 --> 01:15:33,306
We're a trio. Right?

820
01:15:33,607 --> 01:15:34,606
A trio?

821
01:15:35,506 --> 01:15:38,486
A trio of a suicidal man, a moron,
an unmarried mother.

822
01:15:40,324 --> 01:15:41,322
Brother.

823
01:15:42,403 --> 01:15:44,571
There's no such things
as friends or salvation.

824
01:15:46,651 --> 01:15:47,693
 This is cowardly.

825
01:15:48,181 --> 01:15:50,343
Why are you suddenly using me
as an excuse to run away?

826
01:15:52,321 --> 01:15:56,725
You got your sickness from your father,
and my daughter from me.

827
01:15:59,782 --> 01:16:02,572
It's now time to erase
these original sins.

828
01:16:05,228 --> 01:16:07,976
To let go of all the sins.

829
01:16:08,658 --> 01:16:09,656
<i>Brother!</i>

830
01:16:11,526 --> 01:16:12,804
Don't follow me.

831
01:16:14,610 --> 01:16:17,095
What are you both doing?
Are you all crazy?

832
01:16:21,523 --> 01:16:22,521
Don't go.

833
01:16:24,128 --> 01:16:25,981
Should I tell you a funny story?

834
01:16:26,062 --> 01:16:27,792
One day a masochist said,

835
01:16:28,287 --> 01:16:31,014
"I beg you please, please torture me."

836
01:16:31,094 --> 01:16:33,232
And then the sadist replied,

837
01:16:34,470 --> 01:16:35,468
"No."

838
01:16:35,490 --> 01:16:37,007
You can't shoot me.

839
01:16:37,951 --> 01:16:40,498
Because that would be such
a great gift to me.

840
01:16:42,486 --> 01:16:45,322
Would killing a suicidal man
be a blessing?

841
01:16:45,751 --> 01:16:46,802
Or a curse?

842
01:16:52,636 --> 01:16:54,500
Fuck, what did I do wrong to you?

843
01:16:55,029 --> 01:16:57,073
I believed in you. That's why I'm here.

844
01:16:57,763 --> 01:17:01,368
And what she did that. She came
back to save us. That makes it even.

845
01:17:05,593 --> 01:17:06,993
How righteous are you?

846
01:17:07,849 --> 01:17:09,362
You think you're that great?

847
01:17:09,879 --> 01:17:10,878
Sure.

848
01:17:11,425 --> 01:17:13,634
I'm an orphan and a moron.
So what?

849
01:17:15,712 --> 01:17:17,366
Now, even you will le...

850
01:17:19,576 --> 01:17:20,614
Even you will...

851
01:17:23,039 --> 01:17:25,169
Even now you will throw me away.

852
01:17:26,294 --> 01:17:27,292
Fine. Leave.

853
01:17:27,595 --> 01:17:29,098
Leave. You think I won't shoot.

854
01:17:29,376 --> 01:17:31,935
I'll shoot and kill all those who
betray me. Leave.

855
01:17:44,328 --> 01:17:46,125
I'm different from you two.

856
01:17:47,571 --> 01:17:49,169
I've got a home to return to.

857
01:17:49,803 --> 01:17:51,481
Did you just shoot at me?

858
01:17:52,050 --> 01:17:53,048
You shot.

859
01:17:53,810 --> 01:17:55,901
I'm going to kill you.

860
01:18:04,632 --> 01:18:05,910
If you follow me

861
01:18:07,704 --> 01:18:08,955
you'll be killed, you idiot.

862
01:18:15,183 --> 01:18:16,720
Where will you go now?

863
01:18:23,136 --> 01:18:24,895
Aren't we going to get your fucking kid?

864
01:18:28,306 --> 01:18:30,702
How can you say that about
your daughter?

865
01:18:35,772 --> 01:18:39,893
Your faces are in newspapers and
on TV. How will you travel?

866
01:18:41,154 --> 01:18:42,556
Here. Take this.

867
01:18:52,425 --> 01:18:54,102
You fucking arsehole!

868
01:18:55,375 --> 01:18:57,052
These fucking arseholes.

869
01:18:58,432 --> 01:18:59,648
I'm so hungry.

870
01:19:00,113 --> 01:19:01,493
What the fuck is all this?

871
01:19:02,261 --> 01:19:03,935
I want fried chicken.

872
01:19:04,827 --> 01:19:06,587
And roast sweet potatoes.

873
01:19:07,329 --> 01:19:09,162
Ma Ri-Ah, I'm hungry.

874
01:19:10,168 --> 01:19:11,166
Hey.

875
01:19:14,083 --> 01:19:16,546
I'm not doing this. I'm not doing this.

876
01:19:18,442 --> 01:19:19,800
What am I doing.

877
01:19:20,288 --> 01:19:22,418
Why did you tell me to cut my beard.

878
01:19:22,712 --> 01:19:25,446
<i>What a waste of my beard.
I'm not doing this anymore.</i>

879
01:19:26,017 --> 01:19:27,141
<i>I'm not doing this anymore</i>

880
01:19:45,327 --> 01:19:46,500
Is this your car?

881
01:19:46,864 --> 01:19:48,251
It's her dad's car.

882
01:19:49,187 --> 01:19:50,917
And what does her dad do?

883
01:19:52,042 --> 01:19:54,618
He's a monk, so that's why
he chose the colour grey.

884
01:19:57,417 --> 01:20:00,848
If her dad is a monk, then
I'm Mother Teresa, you fuck.

885
01:20:02,038 --> 01:20:03,950
You're about to find
Śarīras from my body soon.

886
01:20:08,847 --> 01:20:09,956
 You're not taking it off?

887
01:20:13,079 --> 01:20:14,528
You want me to sing more?

888
01:20:14,764 --> 01:20:16,627
It's probably best to stop.

889
01:20:17,663 --> 01:20:18,663
However...

890
01:20:20,904 --> 01:20:24,137
You will talk now about how painful
it was when you lost your virginity

891
01:20:27,539 --> 01:20:28,537
What's this?

892
01:20:29,789 --> 01:20:31,097
You haven't done it yet?

893
01:20:31,843 --> 01:20:34,257
You saying you're a virgin?
Want me to check?

894
01:20:34,787 --> 01:20:35,786
Hey you.

895
01:20:35,845 --> 01:20:38,212
If we take it off, it will reveal all.

896
01:20:42,301 --> 01:20:43,299
Now begin.

897
01:20:45,732 --> 01:20:47,625
It was Year 9 during summer vacation.

898
01:20:50,818 --> 01:20:51,873
That's good.

899
01:20:53,055 --> 01:20:54,208
And how old are you now?

900
01:20:55,266 --> 01:20:56,264
Twenty.

901
01:20:57,603 --> 01:20:59,599
You probably fooled around
plenty since then.

902
01:21:00,788 --> 01:21:02,040
Did you know about that?

903
01:21:02,876 --> 01:21:06,223
- You said I was your first.
- Go die somewhere you retard.

904
01:21:07,158 --> 01:21:09,756
How can you trust anyone
that sits down to piss.

905
01:21:15,619 --> 01:21:18,186
Can you die by getting
hit by a tear gas gun?

906
01:21:18,288 --> 01:21:20,356
Why do they use this,
when there are guns?

907
01:21:25,406 --> 01:21:26,972
A quick inspection please.

908
01:21:44,563 --> 01:21:46,113
- Honey.
- You must be tired.

909
01:21:46,248 --> 01:21:47,845
All's good at home?

910
01:22:11,403 --> 01:22:12,401
Cops.

911
01:22:12,583 --> 01:22:13,581
Fuck off.

912
01:22:25,235 --> 01:22:28,411
Soon the road splits into two.
Turn left.

913
01:23:11,651 --> 01:23:13,089
You piece of shit.

914
01:23:22,066 --> 01:23:23,424
Put the boss on.

915
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:27,944
We've caught the horn blower.

916
01:23:28,997 --> 01:23:31,193
No. It's a horn. A horn.

917
01:23:31,684 --> 01:23:32,682
Yes.

918
01:23:33,103 --> 01:23:34,101
He's alone.

919
01:23:34,399 --> 01:23:36,815
But I think he's brought the goods.

920
01:23:36,935 --> 01:23:37,933
Yes.

921
01:23:38,705 --> 01:23:41,181
Anyhow, let's wait
a little while longer.

922
01:23:42,791 --> 01:23:44,120
Wait a little longer please.

923
01:23:45,483 --> 01:23:47,250
- Hey.
- Yes, brother.

924
01:23:47,579 --> 01:23:48,946
This prick doesn't seem to know.

925
01:23:48,986 --> 01:23:51,228
Bring the bag, the bag.
It will be in there.

926
01:23:51,260 --> 01:23:52,378
Yes, brother.

927
01:23:56,354 --> 01:23:57,392
Here you are.

928
01:24:02,910 --> 01:24:03,908
What's this?

929
01:24:12,286 --> 01:24:14,385
That's an alto saxophone.

930
01:24:16,201 --> 01:24:18,229
Be quiet!
I'll kill her.

931
01:24:18,475 --> 01:24:21,026
Don't move. I'll kill her.
Don't come closer.

932
01:24:21,521 --> 01:24:22,639
<i>I'll kill her!</i>

933
01:24:40,306 --> 01:24:42,651
Have you been well, mother-in-law.

934
01:25:17,466 --> 01:25:18,465
Who are they?

935
01:25:18,516 --> 01:25:20,530
They're here after
hearing over the police radio.

936
01:25:20,581 --> 01:25:22,989
He's been wanted for crimes
committed for a few years.

937
01:25:23,332 --> 01:25:25,250
They're here
wanting to arrest him first.

938
01:25:29,256 --> 01:25:30,350
- Alright.
- Yes sir.

939
01:26:14,231 --> 01:26:15,696
Who the hell is this guy?

940
01:26:15,949 --> 01:26:17,201
At least his name.

941
01:26:18,644 --> 01:26:22,581
Don't talk to me so casually
just because you gave me a cigarette.

942
01:26:23,848 --> 01:26:26,361
You look younger than me.
Why don't you like it?

943
01:26:30,044 --> 01:26:31,977
You won't be able to find him ever.

944
01:26:34,762 --> 01:26:37,025
I don't really care if you
escape or don't.

945
01:26:38,238 --> 01:26:40,901
My concerns are for the
people in there.

946
01:26:42,208 --> 01:26:43,725
I like you mister.

947
01:26:43,776 --> 01:26:45,618
<i>Chief, we're getting into position.</i>

948
01:26:45,715 --> 01:26:46,803
How about this.

949
01:26:47,656 --> 01:26:50,160
Bring me a helicopter
and I'll let go of the hostages.

950
01:26:51,531 --> 01:26:53,605
When it arrives and we lift off,

951
01:26:54,422 --> 01:26:57,900
if I see any of you rats
within a 50 metre radius

952
01:26:59,049 --> 01:27:00,816
It all fucking ends.

953
01:27:00,867 --> 01:27:01,865
<i>Please keep talking.</i>

954
01:27:04,308 --> 01:27:06,693
If you escape,
send me a postcard.

955
01:27:08,053 --> 01:27:09,812
How about a lottery ticket instead.

956
01:27:10,961 --> 01:27:13,845
If anybody is lucky enough to
escape this situation,

957
01:27:14,642 --> 01:27:16,567
it's obvious that they will win.

958
01:27:16,766 --> 01:27:18,152
Is Ma Ri-Ah going too?

959
01:27:19,768 --> 01:27:21,266
<i>Please delay for longer.</i>

960
01:27:23,199 --> 01:27:26,194
I have a personal favour to ask.
Could you listen?

961
01:27:28,302 --> 01:27:31,217
Ma Ri-Ah has lost her baby.
Find it for her.

962
01:27:32,192 --> 01:27:33,650
A mother's pain is something,

963
01:27:33,919 --> 01:27:34,957
being an orphan,

964
01:27:35,789 --> 01:27:37,374
is really fucked up.

965
01:27:38,002 --> 01:27:39,041
<i>To your left.</i>

966
01:27:41,694 --> 01:27:43,132
<i>Please keep talking.</i>

967
01:27:47,542 --> 01:27:48,541
Yes.

968
01:27:49,458 --> 01:27:51,487
I think another person like
you entering the world

969
01:27:52,153 --> 01:27:53,436
is fucked up too.

970
01:27:53,717 --> 01:27:54,715
<i>More to the left.</i>

971
01:27:57,917 --> 01:27:59,596
<i>I'll now count to three before shooting.</i>

972
01:27:59,968 --> 01:28:01,085
<i>Starting now. One, </i>

973
01:28:01,143 --> 01:28:02,978
- I like you.
- <i>Two, three.</i>

974
01:28:03,035 --> 01:28:04,033
<i>Crouch down.</i>

975
01:28:04,084 --> 01:28:05,427
- Have a good one.
- <i>Crouch down.</i>

976
01:28:05,560 --> 01:28:06,558
 <i>Crouch down!</i>

977
01:28:08,693 --> 01:28:09,692
Hey Jae-Mi.

978
01:28:11,695 --> 01:28:12,693
Jae-Mi.

979
01:28:13,367 --> 01:28:14,405
Daddy's here.

980
01:28:14,619 --> 01:28:15,817
Open your eyes.

981
01:28:16,797 --> 01:28:17,796
Hey Jae-Mi.

982
01:29:12,413 --> 01:29:13,411
If you tell the police,

983
01:29:14,403 --> 01:29:15,703
your daughter dies.

984
01:29:17,130 --> 01:29:18,128
Now go.

985
01:30:03,403 --> 01:30:05,080
It's time to divvy it up.

986
01:30:13,535 --> 01:30:14,533
Here.

987
01:30:19,781 --> 01:30:21,413
Aren't you coming
for me later?

988
01:30:22,717 --> 01:30:24,194
You can give me the money then.

989
01:30:26,468 --> 01:30:28,758
They'll confiscate it if
I take it with me anyway.

990
01:30:37,227 --> 01:30:38,225
What's wrong?

991
01:30:44,635 --> 01:30:45,791
It's the first time,

992
01:30:47,583 --> 01:30:49,579
anyone's trusted me
with money matters.

993
01:31:03,557 --> 01:31:04,556
I trust you.

994
01:31:06,125 --> 01:31:07,855
That you'll find me again.

995
01:31:49,843 --> 01:31:51,091
Turn your head away.

996
01:31:57,382 --> 01:31:59,299
You're going to come find me right?

997
01:31:59,809 --> 01:32:00,807
Right?

998
01:33:16,940 --> 01:33:18,552
If you have this, I can find you.

999
01:33:19,837 --> 01:33:21,144
It's a good luck charm

1000
01:33:24,947 --> 01:33:25,955
Also,

1001
01:33:27,001 --> 01:33:27,998
And lastly

1002
01:33:28,981 --> 01:33:31,128
There's something I want to say
and something I want to hear from you.

1003
01:33:34,036 --> 01:33:35,556
Tell me what you want to say first.

1004
01:33:40,371 --> 01:33:41,482
Until two minutes ago,

1005
01:33:42,249 --> 01:33:43,247
I was a virgin.

1006
01:33:45,325 --> 01:33:46,323
What?

1007
01:33:47,916 --> 01:33:49,194
You're my first.

1008
01:33:50,197 --> 01:33:51,219
Fuck sake.

1009
01:33:53,692 --> 01:33:55,369
Now it's my turn to ask.

1010
01:33:56,825 --> 01:34:00,382
The thing that brother said at the
cathedral. That's all rubbish right?

1011
01:34:01,967 --> 01:34:02,966
Isn't it?

1012
01:34:05,200 --> 01:34:06,198
It's not.

1013
01:36:29,999 --> 01:36:32,476
Just in case my
mother tries to find me.

1014
01:36:32,997 --> 01:36:34,443
I'm an orphan.

1015
01:36:36,083 --> 01:36:37,880
Fuck, I can't do this shit.

1016
01:36:38,166 --> 01:36:39,553
<i>Fucking hell.</i>

1017
01:36:40,270 --> 01:36:41,882
Don't swear on tape.

1018
01:36:43,266 --> 01:36:47,128
How many times do I have to say,
I'm selling this to the TV stations.

1019
01:36:47,208 --> 01:36:49,782
Fine.
Talk to me informally then.

1020
01:36:52,090 --> 01:36:53,704
Respect the TV stations.

1021
01:36:57,645 --> 01:36:58,901
Let's start again.

1022
01:37:11,417 --> 01:37:12,415
Fine then.

1023
01:37:19,061 --> 01:37:20,383
Shall we get going.

1024
01:37:34,904 --> 01:37:36,519
They've changed. It's not him.

1025
01:37:44,022 --> 01:37:45,699
Fly you son of a bitch.

1026
01:39:58,837 --> 01:39:59,836
<i>Daddy!</i>

1027
01:40:08,655 --> 01:40:09,653
Daddy.
