1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:01:10,202 --> 00:01:16,664

3
00:01:23,956 --> 00:01:25,355
Hello? Who!?

4
00:01:25,725 --> 00:01:27,488
No. I'm sorry, I don't know anyone by that name

5
00:01:27,693 --> 00:01:29,752
No, listen, I get about a hundred customers a night

6
00:01:30,062 --> 00:01:31,324
I can't keep track of them all.

7
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:33,293
Do you know... well tell me what he likes to eat

8
00:01:33,632 --> 00:01:34,621
Cause I remember people by what they order

9
00:01:34,967 --> 00:01:36,764
Not by their names

10
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:38,664
"Meat Loaf? "

11
00:01:38,871 --> 00:01:41,602
Well, I know a Meat Loaf with Mashed Potatoes.

12
00:01:41,603 --> 00:01:43,171
I know Meat Loaf who likes

13
00:01:43,375 --> 00:01:47,038
Well, with Cheese Fries, Pouched Egg, Onion Rings

14
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,505
What? He doesn't like potatoes?

15
00:01:49,715 --> 00:01:53,082
Why don't you, well, yeah give me your number

16
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:54,946
And if I see him, I'll tell him to call you

17
00:01:55,454 --> 00:01:57,786
Yeah, I promise. I will. Ok bye

18
00:02:01,327 --> 00:02:03,192
He's 5'11 with dark brown hair

19
00:02:03,429 --> 00:02:05,989
Sorry, I can't think of any Meat Loafs with Cheese Fries

20
00:02:06,198 --> 00:02:07,893
or Onion Rings or Pouched Eggs

21
00:02:08,167 --> 00:02:10,397
Or Fried Fillet of Fish that match that description

22
00:02:10,836 --> 00:02:12,861
Last time we were here, I think he had the pork chops

23
00:02:13,272 --> 00:02:14,261
Oh why didn't you say so?

24
00:02:14,607 --> 00:02:17,075
That's because we supposedly have the best pork chops in the city

25
00:02:17,309 --> 00:02:17,866
You ever tried them?

26
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:18,872
No, I haven't

27
00:02:19,078 --> 00:02:20,909
Why not? What, are you religious or something?

28
00:02:21,914 --> 00:02:23,779
Listen, have you seen him or not?

29
00:02:25,184 --> 00:02:28,847
5'11 ". Dark brown hair. Pork chops

30
00:02:29,588 --> 00:02:31,988
I have actually. He came in here for dinner last night

31
00:02:32,358 --> 00:02:33,154
He ordered two pork chops

32
00:02:33,425 --> 00:02:35,916
One with mashed potatoes and one with string beans.

33
00:02:36,962 --> 00:02:38,122
I guess he was hungry

34
00:02:38,397 --> 00:02:39,762
No, he didn't eat both of them.

35
00:02:39,999 --> 00:02:41,933
Our portions are too big for a person to eat two

36
00:02:42,234 --> 00:02:44,327
No, one was for him and one was for his girlfriend

37
00:02:45,304 --> 00:02:46,965
Look! Just get to the point...

38
00:02:47,306 --> 00:02:48,967
Don't... Don't change the subject!

39
00:02:50,643 --> 00:02:52,508
Are you seeing someone else?

40
00:02:53,813 --> 00:02:54,802
Who is she?

41
00:02:58,017 --> 00:02:59,484
I hope you both drop dead!

42
00:03:20,005 --> 00:03:21,802
If someone comes in here looking for me

43
00:03:22,007 --> 00:03:23,167
give him these keys

44
00:03:23,876 --> 00:03:24,638
What do I tell him?

45
00:03:24,877 --> 00:03:26,139
Tell him he's an asshole!

46
00:03:31,417 --> 00:03:32,509
Taxi!

47
00:03:56,275 --> 00:03:57,833
Hey, did he pick up the keys?

48
00:03:58,577 --> 00:03:59,839
No, not yet

49
00:04:10,956 --> 00:04:12,355
Do you have an extra cigarette?

50
00:04:12,524 --> 00:04:13,491
Sure

51
00:04:15,761 --> 00:04:16,955
Rolled it myself

52
00:04:17,196 --> 00:04:18,060
Thanks

53
00:04:28,173 --> 00:04:29,197
You okay?

54
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:30,739
Yeah

55
00:04:32,344 --> 00:04:34,107
I haven't had one in a while

56
00:04:34,346 --> 00:04:36,007
I only smoke when I get stressed out

57
00:04:36,215 --> 00:04:37,079
Well, you shouldn't worry so much

58
00:04:37,483 --> 00:04:38,916
That way you'll avoid lung cancer

59
00:04:42,488 --> 00:04:43,750
Do you think she's pretty?

60
00:04:44,857 --> 00:04:45,516
Who?

61
00:04:45,724 --> 00:04:46,986
The girl he was in here with

62
00:04:48,494 --> 00:04:51,258
Oh, she was okay I guess... I mean

63
00:04:51,497 --> 00:04:53,829
Not the type I would prefer to have my pork chops with

64
00:04:54,133 --> 00:04:57,000
but "each man to his own", right?

65
00:04:57,903 --> 00:04:59,268
Yeah right

66
00:05:37,009 --> 00:05:37,873
Hello

67
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:39,134
Hey

68
00:05:46,719 --> 00:05:48,311
I need someone to talk to

69
00:05:53,225 --> 00:05:54,817
Do you think he'll pick up the keys?

70
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,420
I don't know

71
00:05:56,762 --> 00:05:59,060
I've had customers leaving keys here for years

72
00:05:59,298 --> 00:06:00,822
Sometimes they pick them up in a few days

73
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,193
Sometimes it takes a few weeks

74
00:06:03,736 --> 00:06:05,169
Well, what about most of the time?

75
00:06:05,404 --> 00:06:08,032
Most of the time, the keys stay in the jar

76
00:06:14,513 --> 00:06:15,946
Well why do you keep them?

77
00:06:16,415 --> 00:06:17,439
You should just throw them out

78
00:06:17,649 --> 00:06:18,638
No

79
00:06:19,952 --> 00:06:21,476
No I couldn't do that

80
00:06:23,088 --> 00:06:24,146
Why not?

81
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:26,719
If I threw these keys away

82
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:29,723
then those doors will be closed forever

83
00:06:29,995 --> 00:06:31,519
And that shouldn't be up to me to decide

84
00:06:32,931 --> 00:06:34,023
Should it?

85
00:06:39,671 --> 00:06:41,571
Guess I'm just looking for a reason

86
00:06:43,876 --> 00:06:46,276
Well, from my observations

87
00:06:47,613 --> 00:06:50,343
sometimes it's better off not knowing

88
00:06:50,682 --> 00:06:54,812
and other times there's no reason to be found

89
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,715
Everything has a reason

90
00:07:00,592 --> 00:07:02,150
It's like these pies and cakes

91
00:07:02,928 --> 00:07:04,395
At the end of every night

92
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:08,457
the cheesecake and the apple pie are always completely gone

93
00:07:08,667 --> 00:07:09,998
The peach cobbler

94
00:07:10,302 --> 00:07:13,100
and the chocolate mousse cake are nearly finished

95
00:07:13,272 --> 00:07:18,141
But there's always a whole blueberry pie left untouched

96
00:07:20,045 --> 00:07:21,876
So what's wrong with the blueberry pie?

97
00:07:22,081 --> 00:07:23,776
There's nothing's wrong with the blueberry pie

98
00:07:24,049 --> 00:07:25,073
It's just people make other choices

99
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:26,715
You can't blame the blueberry pie

100
00:07:26,985 --> 00:07:28,714
It's just no one wants it

101
00:07:30,856 --> 00:07:31,845
Wait!

102
00:07:33,725 --> 00:07:35,022
I want a piece

103
00:07:35,294 --> 00:07:36,318
With ice cream?

104
00:07:39,565 --> 00:07:40,532
Leave it to me

105
00:07:47,806 --> 00:07:48,795
Here we go

106
00:07:49,675 --> 00:07:50,869
I hope you enjoy it

107
00:07:51,076 --> 00:07:51,940
Thanks

108
00:08:09,828 --> 00:08:10,817
It's not bad

109
00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:11,961
Really?

110
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,858
You should try some

111
00:08:16,068 --> 00:08:18,696
No, I'm alright. I have my own

112
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:16,253
Will you tell me the stories behind those other keys?

113
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:19,497
What for?

114
00:09:21,667 --> 00:09:24,329
I just wondered how they all ended up here

115
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:29,307
Pick one

116
00:09:34,713 --> 00:09:38,444
Those belonged to a young couple a few years ago.

117
00:09:38,684 --> 00:09:39,810
They were naive enough to believe

118
00:09:40,085 --> 00:09:41,950
that they were gonna spend the rest of their lives together

119
00:09:43,422 --> 00:09:44,548
Well, what happened?

120
00:09:45,324 --> 00:09:46,621
Life happened

121
00:09:47,526 --> 00:09:49,289
Things happened. Yeah, time happened

122
00:09:50,929 --> 00:09:53,295
It's pretty much always the case more or less

123
00:09:55,634 --> 00:09:57,829
Or maybe one of them ran off with someone else

124
00:09:58,036 --> 00:09:59,901
Maybe the feelings just went away

125
00:10:06,511 --> 00:10:07,739
What about these?

126
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:10,648
Those belonged to a little old lady

127
00:10:10,882 --> 00:10:13,009
Her best friend would pick them up and come to visit her

128
00:10:13,252 --> 00:10:14,879
She dropped them off and I never saw her again

129
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,314
I presumed, I mean, she was pretty old

130
00:10:16,521 --> 00:10:19,046
I presumed she passed away or something

131
00:10:22,294 --> 00:10:23,693
What about these?

132
00:10:26,331 --> 00:10:28,959
These keys used to belong to a young lad

133
00:10:29,635 --> 00:10:31,125
from Manchester England

134
00:10:32,437 --> 00:10:34,405
who made plans and had dreams

135
00:10:34,606 --> 00:10:36,369
of running every marathon in this country

136
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:37,936
starting in New York

137
00:10:39,578 --> 00:10:42,046
He was going to write a journal about his experiences

138
00:10:42,414 --> 00:10:45,247
and ended up running a cafe.

139
00:10:46,852 --> 00:10:48,786
Later they were given to a Russian girl

140
00:10:50,422 --> 00:10:52,253
who loved collecting keys

141
00:10:53,258 --> 00:10:54,657
and watching sunsets

142
00:10:55,761 --> 00:10:59,197
Unfortunately, she loved sunsets more than the keys

143
00:10:59,498 --> 00:11:01,056
and ended up disappearing into one

144
00:11:03,468 --> 00:11:05,561
Why didn't you go looking for her?

145
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:13,234
When I was little

146
00:11:13,512 --> 00:11:15,742
me mum used to take me to the park on weekends

147
00:11:16,148 --> 00:11:17,945
She said if I ever got lost

148
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:21,849
I had to stay in one place so that she'd find me

149
00:11:22,187 --> 00:11:23,085
Does that work?

150
00:11:23,789 --> 00:11:24,983
Not really

151
00:11:25,891 --> 00:11:27,916
She got lost once looking for me

152
00:11:28,627 --> 00:11:30,117
Eh, you want some more ice cream?

153
00:11:30,662 --> 00:11:31,390
No thanks

154
00:11:31,596 --> 00:11:32,392
You sure?

155
00:11:32,631 --> 00:11:33,825
Yeah I'm fine. Thanks

156
00:12:15,207 --> 00:12:16,174
You're late

157
00:12:18,777 --> 00:12:20,005
Same as usual?

158
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:33,316
No thanks

159
00:12:39,931 --> 00:12:41,364
Can I have my keys back?

160
00:12:42,434 --> 00:12:43,867
Yeah, sure

161
00:12:48,173 --> 00:12:49,162
So...

162
00:12:50,442 --> 00:12:52,774
You two have patched things up then?

163
00:12:55,247 --> 00:12:56,179
Thanks

164
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,045
Lousy bloody camera

165
00:13:34,853 --> 00:13:35,785
Hey!

166
00:13:36,021 --> 00:13:38,581
Alright. Come on. Break it... Alright!

167
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:40,621
Take it outside. Take it out...

168
00:13:40,892 --> 00:13:41,415
None of your business cupcake!

169
00:13:41,726 --> 00:13:42,488
Don't start with me mate!

170
00:13:42,761 --> 00:13:44,092
Don't you start... Come here!

171
00:13:44,362 --> 00:13:45,260
Right you come here

172
00:13:45,664 --> 00:13:46,824
Get out of my place!

173
00:13:48,934 --> 00:13:50,561
Don't start with me!

174
00:13:50,802 --> 00:13:51,666
Get out!

175
00:13:52,404 --> 00:13:54,497
Hey you haven't paid yet!

176
00:14:16,728 --> 00:14:17,888
Can I have a tissue?

177
00:14:18,096 --> 00:14:18,960
What happened?

178
00:14:19,431 --> 00:14:20,295
Did he hit you?

179
00:14:20,499 --> 00:14:21,466
No!

180
00:14:21,766 --> 00:14:22,858
Well what?

181
00:14:24,202 --> 00:14:26,102
I got mugged on the subway

182
00:14:26,638 --> 00:14:28,606
I thought Pork Chop lived around here?

183
00:14:30,108 --> 00:14:31,268
He does

184
00:14:31,643 --> 00:14:33,474
What were you doing on the subway?

185
00:14:34,613 --> 00:14:35,671
Well...

186
00:14:36,581 --> 00:14:38,845
I just needed some time to prepare myself

187
00:14:40,952 --> 00:14:43,079
I was gonna get off in a few stops

188
00:14:44,556 --> 00:14:45,716
I don't know, I just

189
00:14:45,924 --> 00:14:47,755
The next thing I knew, I ended up in the Bronx

190
00:14:48,727 --> 00:14:51,059
That's a very interesting way to prepare yourself

191
00:14:57,302 --> 00:14:59,361
I've never been very good at confrontation

192
00:15:02,107 --> 00:15:03,802
Some people enjoy it

193
00:15:04,709 --> 00:15:05,801
Not me

194
00:15:10,448 --> 00:15:12,040
Hey, are you alright?

195
00:15:12,317 --> 00:15:13,614
Should we call the police or something?

196
00:15:16,988 --> 00:15:17,920
No

197
00:15:20,425 --> 00:15:22,586
No, he didn't get away with very much

198
00:15:23,929 --> 00:15:26,329
Especially after I kicked him in the balls

199
00:15:27,332 --> 00:15:28,321
You didn't

200
00:15:36,975 --> 00:15:38,704
Wait, what happened to you?

201
00:15:42,514 --> 00:15:44,641
I ate too much chocolate today

202
00:15:53,124 --> 00:15:54,489
What's wrong with your camera?

203
00:15:54,693 --> 00:15:55,785
Oh, I don't know

204
00:15:56,027 --> 00:15:59,087
It's been in a lousy mood these past few days

205
00:16:00,599 --> 00:16:03,500
It doesn't really keep people from stealing, does it?

206
00:16:03,802 --> 00:16:04,734
No

207
00:16:07,372 --> 00:16:08,498
Not really

208
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,834
But I like having it around, 'cause

209
00:16:14,179 --> 00:16:15,840
for me it's like my diary

210
00:16:16,448 --> 00:16:17,278
You know?

211
00:16:24,356 --> 00:16:26,551
Some nights, I watch the tapes back and

212
00:16:28,026 --> 00:16:30,517
I'm amazed at how much I've missed

213
00:16:31,963 --> 00:16:34,523
That's going on right in front of me

214
00:16:36,701 --> 00:16:38,430
You must have a lot of tapes

215
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,231
I don't keep them all

216
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,737
I'm not that weird

217
00:16:45,577 --> 00:16:47,044
Only the highlights

218
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:00,316
Can I take a look?

219
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:02,491
Sure

220
00:17:03,828 --> 00:17:04,817
Come around

221
00:21:17,882 --> 00:21:21,010
She left behind her set of keys and disappeared that night

222
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:31,328

223
00:21:58,856 --> 00:22:02,223
How do you say goodbye to someone you can't imagine living without?

224
00:22:03,828 --> 00:22:05,318
I didn't say goodbye

225
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,990
I didn't say anything

226
00:22:15,606 --> 00:22:16,971
I just walked away

227
00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:21,043
At the end of that night

228
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:24,077
I decided to take the longest way to cross the street

229
00:22:33,324 --> 00:22:34,621
Dear Jeremy

230
00:22:35,593 --> 00:22:37,458
As you can see by this postcard

231
00:22:37,695 --> 00:22:39,185
I'm now in Memphis, Tennessee

232
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:41,830
Hey Lizzy, hurry up with those damn pick-ups will ya!

233
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:42,489
Coming!

234
00:22:42,734 --> 00:22:43,257
Come on hustle it!

235
00:22:43,568 --> 00:22:45,593
It took me a long time to get here

236
00:22:45,937 --> 00:22:47,996
And I'm not sure how long I'll be staying

237
00:22:49,107 --> 00:22:51,701
During the day, I work at a diner downtown

238
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:54,605
I haven't been able to sleep at night

239
00:22:54,846 --> 00:22:57,815
so I've also taken a waitressing job at a bar

240
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:03,143
It's kind of a dive, but the tips are pretty good

241
00:23:03,654 --> 00:23:05,781
Working two jobs is exhausting

242
00:23:06,224 --> 00:23:07,953
But at least it keeps me busy

243
00:23:08,459 --> 00:23:12,088
and most importantly, it keeps my mind away from him

244
00:23:24,909 --> 00:23:27,434

245
00:23:43,961 --> 00:23:44,484
Hi girl

246
00:23:44,729 --> 00:23:45,627
Hey Sandy

247
00:23:46,397 --> 00:23:47,295
You going home?

248
00:23:48,132 --> 00:23:49,292
Let me put it this way

249
00:23:50,034 --> 00:23:51,433
I'm getting up out of here

250
00:23:53,571 --> 00:23:55,004
I wish I could go

251
00:23:55,373 --> 00:23:56,533
What's wrong?

252
00:23:56,741 --> 00:23:57,935
That guy at the bar

253
00:23:58,476 --> 00:24:00,103
I don't think he's ever gonna leave

254
00:24:01,479 --> 00:24:03,470
Oh you're talking about Arnie?

255
00:24:03,748 --> 00:24:04,646
Child, don't worry about him.

256
00:24:05,083 --> 00:24:06,710
He probably just lost track of time

257
00:24:06,951 --> 00:24:08,043
But now if you need to get going

258
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:10,150
You just bring his check to him, have him sign it

259
00:24:10,521 --> 00:24:11,681
Travis runs a tab for him

260
00:24:12,156 --> 00:24:13,487
Well, does he always stay this late?

261
00:24:14,092 --> 00:24:15,389
Always

262
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:17,589
You stick around here you see for yourself

263
00:24:18,329 --> 00:24:19,159
Have a good night darlin'

264
00:24:19,397 --> 00:24:20,921
You too. Good night

265
00:24:31,843 --> 00:24:33,140
Here's your check

266
00:24:50,795 --> 00:24:52,160
Just eight?

267
00:24:53,798 --> 00:24:56,631
I coulda sworn I had at least nine

268
00:24:57,602 --> 00:24:59,069
No, just eight

269
00:25:01,272 --> 00:25:02,637
Do you have a pen?

270
00:25:03,441 --> 00:25:04,465
Yeah

271
00:25:08,513 --> 00:25:10,140
I don't recognize you

272
00:25:10,781 --> 00:25:12,840
You new around here or something?

273
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:14,449
I just started a few nights ago

274
00:25:14,785 --> 00:25:15,911
Oh

275
00:25:22,627 --> 00:25:24,094
Have you got a name?

276
00:25:25,429 --> 00:25:26,418
Lizzie

277
00:25:26,731 --> 00:25:27,925
Lizzie

278
00:25:30,468 --> 00:25:33,835
Well, it's been a pleasure getting to know you Lizzie

279
00:25:36,574 --> 00:25:37,802
What do you mean?

280
00:25:38,109 --> 00:25:41,442
You won't be seeing much more of me from now on

281
00:25:41,879 --> 00:25:42,937
Why's that?

282
00:25:45,583 --> 00:25:49,383
Well I don't have much reason to come back here anymore

283
00:25:52,223 --> 00:25:54,316
Tonight was my last night of drinking

284
00:25:54,759 --> 00:25:55,521
Oh

285
00:25:58,062 --> 00:25:59,188
Yeah

286
00:26:01,199 --> 00:26:04,259
So, you just give that to Travis

287
00:26:05,636 --> 00:26:08,503
Tell him I'll cut him a check

288
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,007
Ok

289
00:26:16,414 --> 00:26:17,506
That's for you

290
00:26:18,516 --> 00:26:19,608
Thank you

291
00:26:24,422 --> 00:26:25,354
Bye

292
00:26:41,639 --> 00:26:42,867
Oh, hi

293
00:26:43,941 --> 00:26:45,272
Do you have a twin sister?

294
00:26:45,676 --> 00:26:46,608
No

295
00:26:47,612 --> 00:26:48,601
I wish I did

296
00:26:48,846 --> 00:26:51,406
Yeah? Well, I'm glad I don't have a twin

297
00:26:51,649 --> 00:26:52,980
One of me's plenty

298
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:59,853
Well, let's see I'm just gonna have the chicken fried steak

299
00:27:00,191 --> 00:27:01,158
and a side of string beans

300
00:27:01,959 --> 00:27:02,948
Ok

301
00:27:03,561 --> 00:27:04,585
Coming right up

302
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,764
Hey! Knock that crap off over there!

303
00:27:12,536 --> 00:27:14,333
This is a restaurant, not a damn dancehall!

304
00:27:23,047 --> 00:27:25,379
How come you're working so hard, Lizzie?

305
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:27,442
I'm trying to save up for a car

306
00:27:29,253 --> 00:27:30,481
Where are you going?

307
00:27:31,922 --> 00:27:35,221
Well, I don't have any specific destination in mind, but

308
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,360
I'm just gonna go until I run out of places to go

309
00:27:39,163 --> 00:27:40,357
I wish I could do that

310
00:27:40,564 --> 00:27:41,656
Here's your change

311
00:27:42,933 --> 00:27:44,423
You put that towards a Buick

312
00:27:45,136 --> 00:27:46,068
Thank you

313
00:27:51,909 --> 00:27:52,876
Hi

314
00:27:53,811 --> 00:27:55,142
Wait what are you doing here?

315
00:27:55,313 --> 00:27:55,836
What?

316
00:27:56,147 --> 00:27:57,239
What are you doing here?

317
00:27:57,581 --> 00:27:59,071
Oh, I'm celebrating

318
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:00,708
What are you celebrating?

319
00:28:00,951 --> 00:28:02,612
My last night of drinking!

320
00:28:04,789 --> 00:28:06,950
He's not giving you a hard time, is he?

321
00:28:07,925 --> 00:28:09,586
I think he just wants to talk

322
00:28:09,927 --> 00:28:13,419
That's funny, 'cause he almost never wants to talk

323
00:28:14,498 --> 00:28:15,988
He's not hitting on you, is he?

324
00:28:16,233 --> 00:28:18,929
No. I don't think it's like that

325
00:28:19,804 --> 00:28:20,600
It's too bad

326
00:28:20,838 --> 00:28:22,999
Be nice to see him take an interest in a woman

327
00:28:23,307 --> 00:28:24,069
I thought he was married

328
00:28:24,308 --> 00:28:27,800
Yeah, that's precisely the problem. He still thinks he is

329
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,348
Holy shit

330
00:28:50,267 --> 00:28:51,598
Travis, how's it hanging?

331
00:28:51,869 --> 00:28:53,769
Always a pleasure, Sue Lynne

332
00:28:54,338 --> 00:28:55,498
You always say that to me

333
00:28:55,806 --> 00:28:57,034
and I never know whether you mean it

334
00:28:57,675 --> 00:29:00,075
I'm just dropping in to use the ladies' room

335
00:29:00,745 --> 00:29:02,178
Do I have to buy a beer first?

336
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:04,644
Your money's no good here, Sue Lynne

337
00:29:41,619 --> 00:29:42,950
Have you got a moment?

338
00:29:43,254 --> 00:29:44,778
I got nothing to say to you

339
00:30:10,281 --> 00:30:11,305
Arnie?

340
00:30:15,252 --> 00:30:16,446
Arnie?

341
00:30:18,889 --> 00:30:20,015
Yeah?

342
00:30:26,897 --> 00:30:28,865
I know its none of my business

343
00:30:31,735 --> 00:30:34,397
but have you ever thought about cutting back.

344
00:30:35,673 --> 00:30:37,538
Have I thought about it?

345
00:30:55,659 --> 00:30:56,887
What are these?

346
00:31:00,097 --> 00:31:03,396
A group I go to sometimes, Lizzie,

347
00:31:05,436 --> 00:31:07,028
has this system.

348
00:31:11,442 --> 00:31:13,137
After a meeting,

349
00:31:13,677 --> 00:31:17,579
they invite the new people to come down and

350
00:31:18,549 --> 00:31:20,176
pick up a white chip.

351
00:31:25,623 --> 00:31:28,387
You take it as a symbol of your intention

352
00:31:30,094 --> 00:31:31,493
to stay sober.

353
00:31:36,066 --> 00:31:38,500
And if you

354
00:31:39,336 --> 00:31:41,770
slip up and drink again

355
00:31:45,109 --> 00:31:48,203
you got to come back and pick up another chip.

356
00:31:56,887 --> 00:31:59,321
This one is for ninety days.

357
00:32:01,926 --> 00:32:03,518
I got that far.

358
00:32:04,562 --> 00:32:05,859
Once.

359
00:32:18,776 --> 00:32:21,506
See all those white chips, Lizzie?

360
00:32:24,848 --> 00:32:28,545
I am the king of the white chip.

361
00:33:04,922 --> 00:33:06,219
Dear Jeremy.

362
00:33:06,957 --> 00:33:10,449
I thought about what Arnie said about the sobriety chips,

363
00:33:11,295 --> 00:33:13,786
how to focus your attention on something else

364
00:33:14,031 --> 00:33:15,862
in order to cure your addiction.

365
00:33:18,302 --> 00:33:23,205
If I was an addict, I'd choose blueberry pie as my chip.

366
00:33:28,545 --> 00:33:30,103
Writing to your boyfriend?

367
00:33:31,515 --> 00:33:33,574
No, just someone I know.

368
00:33:34,618 --> 00:33:36,449
Why not pick up the phone?

369
00:33:38,589 --> 00:33:40,716
Some things are better on paper.

370
00:33:41,525 --> 00:33:42,856
Oh you think so?

371
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:00,468
What are you doing?

372
00:34:02,413 --> 00:34:03,846
Well, you know

373
00:34:04,114 --> 00:34:06,344
I listened to what you said the other day.

374
00:34:07,184 --> 00:34:10,745
So I'm trying to write a letter to my wife.

375
00:34:12,289 --> 00:34:14,189
We don't talk to each other much anymore

376
00:34:14,425 --> 00:34:18,486
so I thought maybe I'd try your method.

377
00:34:48,625 --> 00:34:49,455
Randy!

378
00:34:50,527 --> 00:34:51,551
Oh my God!

379
00:35:03,006 --> 00:35:07,466
Arnie! Arnie! Stop! Arnie!

380
00:35:17,988 --> 00:35:19,956
Okay I got. Easy now, watch your back.

381
00:35:20,257 --> 00:35:20,985
You'll be alright, man!

382
00:35:37,007 --> 00:35:39,908
Hello, is that the Memphis Bar and Grill?

383
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:40,940
It is! Great.

384
00:35:41,111 --> 00:35:43,341
Listen, I wonder if you could help me please.

385
00:35:43,547 --> 00:35:46,641
I'm looking for a young woman called Elizabeth.

386
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:49,851
Yes. I realize that. I'm not calling to order your food.

387
00:35:50,187 --> 00:35:51,051
I'm sure it's delicious.

388
00:35:51,288 --> 00:35:55,088
I wonder, does a woman called Elizabeth work there?

389
00:35:55,325 --> 00:35:56,417
Elizabeth!

390
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:57,588
Elizabeth.

391
00:35:57,828 --> 00:35:58,954
That's what I said, Elizabeth.

392
00:35:59,196 --> 00:36:00,891
E- L-I-Z-A-B-

393
00:36:02,232 --> 00:36:03,358
No, alright, thank you.

394
00:36:03,567 --> 00:36:04,295
Thank you.

395
00:36:05,469 --> 00:36:07,733
Good God, it's Jeremy!

396
00:36:07,938 --> 00:36:08,734
Yeah it's me!

397
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:10,700
I never thought I'd hear your voice again.

398
00:36:10,908 --> 00:36:12,899
Well, you see I got your postcard and...

399
00:36:13,177 --> 00:36:14,405
This sounds ridiculous but...

400
00:36:14,645 --> 00:36:16,909
Well I traced every Memphis bar and grill.

401
00:36:17,314 --> 00:36:18,303
There must be at least ninety.

402
00:36:18,615 --> 00:36:20,014
I know its crazy and...

403
00:36:20,284 --> 00:36:22,946
I just wanted to say thanks for staying in touch.

404
00:36:23,153 --> 00:36:24,814
I miss you. I miss your company.

405
00:36:25,155 --> 00:36:27,180
I never thought I'd hear from you again!

406
00:36:28,992 --> 00:36:30,619
It's not really you is it?

407
00:36:31,061 --> 00:36:32,653
No I know you don't know me.

408
00:36:33,397 --> 00:36:34,989
But your name's Elizabeth.

409
00:36:35,933 --> 00:36:37,867
Well, I just... I just wanted

410
00:36:38,435 --> 00:36:40,699
I just wanted to say hello really, and...

411
00:36:41,004 --> 00:36:42,403
I wanted to speak to my friend.

412
00:36:43,607 --> 00:36:44,437
Yeah.

413
00:36:44,641 --> 00:36:47,235
No no, I don't want to order any fried chicken.

414
00:36:48,045 --> 00:36:49,171
Thanks.

415
00:36:50,147 --> 00:36:51,444
Thanks for listening.

416
00:36:52,649 --> 00:36:53,616
Bye.

417
00:36:57,154 --> 00:36:59,349
Goddamn son of a bitch...

418
00:37:00,524 --> 00:37:01,582
I need to talk to you!

419
00:37:01,825 --> 00:37:02,849
Not in here. Let's take this outside.

420
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:05,654
No! I want to talk about it right here!

421
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:09,490
So you feel more like a man now do you?

422
00:37:10,033 --> 00:37:12,228
You feel all big and strong.

423
00:37:13,237 --> 00:37:15,000
I mean you could have killed him!

424
00:37:15,239 --> 00:37:17,434
Yeah, no body ever said sleeping with someone else's wife

425
00:37:17,841 --> 00:37:18,739
was a safe vocation.

426
00:37:19,076 --> 00:37:20,873
Oh goddammit Arnie!

427
00:37:21,178 --> 00:37:22,975
We're, we're separated!

428
00:37:23,213 --> 00:37:24,475
I don't live with you anymore!

429
00:37:24,815 --> 00:37:25,713
I don't talk to you anymore!

430
00:37:26,049 --> 00:37:27,277
You are my goddamn wife!

431
00:37:27,551 --> 00:37:29,985
And I am still your goddamn husband!

432
00:37:30,187 --> 00:37:32,212
No, no you're not...

433
00:37:32,456 --> 00:37:33,548
Not anymore.

434
00:37:34,157 --> 00:37:35,556
Well then what am I?

435
00:37:36,994 --> 00:37:38,325
You're nothing.

436
00:37:39,529 --> 00:37:41,087
Nothing to me.

437
00:37:41,531 --> 00:37:44,227
Sue Lynne, please, please, please baby.

438
00:37:44,501 --> 00:37:46,435
Don't do this, don't do this to me.

439
00:37:46,637 --> 00:37:48,468
I love you, I love you so much.

440
00:37:48,805 --> 00:37:51,205
I just, I just need a little more time.

441
00:37:51,508 --> 00:37:53,135
Goddammit Arnie!

442
00:37:53,377 --> 00:37:55,845
No, no you gotta let me go.

443
00:37:56,113 --> 00:37:58,707
I can't do it anymore. You gotta let me go now.

444
00:37:59,082 --> 00:38:01,073
I'm gonna go, I'm restart my life

445
00:38:01,351 --> 00:38:03,182
and I'm gonna get me a job.

446
00:38:03,387 --> 00:38:04,820
You're gonna get a job, right?

447
00:38:05,088 --> 00:38:06,020
Yes I am.

448
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:07,814
You don't need a job...

449
00:38:08,158 --> 00:38:10,023
What with all those boyfriends of yours.

450
00:38:10,527 --> 00:38:12,620
All you gotta do is just start charging.

451
00:38:12,996 --> 00:38:14,896
You bastard!

452
00:38:15,899 --> 00:38:18,629
YOU GODDAMN BASTARD!

453
00:38:18,902 --> 00:38:20,199
You bastard Arnie!

454
00:38:20,537 --> 00:38:22,630
I'm through with you!

455
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,439
You hear me? I'm through!

456
00:38:25,142 --> 00:38:28,043
I'm through with you! It is over! It is over!

457
00:38:28,445 --> 00:38:29,776
You understand me?

458
00:38:43,694 --> 00:38:44,888
Sue Lynne,

459
00:38:45,762 --> 00:38:48,458
I swear to god, if you walk out of here,

460
00:38:48,932 --> 00:38:50,194
I'll kill you.

461
00:38:59,009 --> 00:39:00,203
Then what?

462
00:39:02,746 --> 00:39:05,214
Arnie, be calm now...

463
00:39:05,482 --> 00:39:07,177
you don't want to do this.

464
00:39:07,517 --> 00:39:08,950
It's over!

465
00:40:33,136 --> 00:40:34,433
It's too much.

466
00:40:34,671 --> 00:40:35,763
Nuh uh.

467
00:40:37,474 --> 00:40:39,806
No no no...

468
00:40:42,946 --> 00:40:46,643
You're saving up to buy a car, right?

469
00:40:49,453 --> 00:40:52,980
Well, I... I don't want you driving around in some

470
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:54,816
junker.

471
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:00,919
So some cop can pull you over for a failed inspection.

472
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:05,826
Thank you.

473
00:41:44,508 --> 00:41:45,532
Wait.

474
00:41:48,145 --> 00:41:49,271
You forgot these.

475
00:42:02,659 --> 00:42:05,219
Yeah... you can just get rid of those.

476
00:42:29,853 --> 00:42:31,684
The police said it was an accident.

477
00:42:32,289 --> 00:42:33,984
He couldn't see where he was going

478
00:42:34,291 --> 00:42:35,724
and he skidded off the road.

479
00:43:34,451 --> 00:43:35,850
Can you give me a vodka?

480
00:43:55,138 --> 00:43:58,039
This is my first drink in six years.

481
00:43:59,142 --> 00:44:01,770
Haven't touched the stuff for six years.

482
00:44:14,724 --> 00:44:16,385
Hey everybody!

483
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:19,652
Let's all drink to Arnie Copeland.

484
00:44:20,597 --> 00:44:23,065
He was guardian of our highways

485
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:27,430
and defender of our freedom!

486
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:39,943
Well, this stuff tastes pretty darn awful.

487
00:44:41,718 --> 00:44:44,346
But I guess nobody drinks it for the taste, right?

488
00:44:46,323 --> 00:44:47,551
Give me another one.

489
00:45:49,853 --> 00:45:51,548
Cheeseburgers?

490
00:45:55,925 --> 00:45:57,324
Whiskey?

491
00:45:59,696 --> 00:46:01,357
This isn't mine.

492
00:46:01,965 --> 00:46:03,398
It's Arnie's tab.

493
00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:22,618
What am I supposed to do with this?

494
00:46:24,421 --> 00:46:27,117
Put it in a frame and hang it on my wall?

495
00:46:32,295 --> 00:46:34,229
Travis wants you to settle it.

496
00:46:38,201 --> 00:46:39,600
Travis!

497
00:46:44,541 --> 00:46:47,237
What are you giving this to me for!?

498
00:46:48,745 --> 00:46:51,737
This is Arnie's tab, not mine!

499
00:46:52,449 --> 00:46:54,747
Why are you giving this to me!?

500
00:46:55,051 --> 00:46:56,211
He was your husband.

501
00:46:56,653 --> 00:46:58,280
Or does that matter at all?

502
00:46:58,588 --> 00:47:00,385
He's dead!

503
00:47:01,524 --> 00:47:04,982
So if you want your money, you better call his lawyer.

504
00:47:05,395 --> 00:47:06,794
Don't give this to me!

505
00:47:06,996 --> 00:47:09,294
Oh God, what a piece of work you are...

506
00:47:09,532 --> 00:47:12,160
God only knows what Arnie saw in you.

507
00:47:12,535 --> 00:47:15,299
I hate you Travis!

508
00:47:18,007 --> 00:47:19,599
I hate you...

509
00:47:24,581 --> 00:47:25,513
Lizzie!

510
00:47:25,748 --> 00:47:27,511
Make sure she gets home safe.

511
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:28,842
Go on now.

512
00:47:29,385 --> 00:47:30,409
Go on!

513
00:47:45,568 --> 00:47:47,399
Hey Sue Lynne?

514
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:52,334
Sue Lynne?

515
00:47:54,544 --> 00:47:55,806
It's late.

516
00:47:57,213 --> 00:47:59,078
Come on let me take you home.

517
00:48:15,598 --> 00:48:16,895
I was

518
00:48:18,101 --> 00:48:21,070
seventeen when he pulled me over.

519
00:48:24,474 --> 00:48:27,068
High as a kite.

520
00:48:29,679 --> 00:48:32,204
"You been drinking, Miss? "

521
00:48:34,651 --> 00:48:36,778
So I smiled.

522
00:48:38,621 --> 00:48:40,589
Bat my eyes.

523
00:48:44,093 --> 00:48:46,789
Who'd have thought we'd be married.

524
00:48:49,933 --> 00:48:52,197
In love with a cop,

525
00:48:53,736 --> 00:48:57,695
and stuck in this godforesaken town.

526
00:49:01,311 --> 00:49:04,405
He was so crazy about me.

527
00:49:07,517 --> 00:49:09,348
I couldn't breathe.

528
00:49:13,523 --> 00:49:15,354
So we tried

529
00:49:17,293 --> 00:49:20,194
drinking our way back into love.

530
00:49:23,266 --> 00:49:26,565
But it never made sense in the morning.

531
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:32,067
So I ran.

532
00:49:35,478 --> 00:49:38,276
And every time I came back,

533
00:49:39,282 --> 00:49:41,216
he was here.

534
00:49:42,285 --> 00:49:46,278
And he was still crazy about me.

535
00:49:50,526 --> 00:49:51,993
You know,

536
00:49:55,331 --> 00:49:59,097
I used to daydream about him dying.

537
00:50:03,239 --> 00:50:05,730
I thought it was the

538
00:50:06,909 --> 00:50:09,742
only way I'd get clear of him.

539
00:50:16,619 --> 00:50:18,519
You must have hated him.

540
00:50:21,991 --> 00:50:23,822
I didn't hate him.

541
00:50:28,498 --> 00:50:30,830
I just wanted him to

542
00:50:33,202 --> 00:50:34,794
let go of me.

543
00:50:37,573 --> 00:50:38,904
And...

544
00:50:42,345 --> 00:50:44,404
now that he has,

545
00:50:50,053 --> 00:50:52,749
it hurts me more than

546
00:50:55,858 --> 00:50:58,850
anything else in the whole world.

547
00:51:11,607 --> 00:51:13,666
This is where we met.

548
00:51:22,885 --> 00:51:25,854
Right here.

549
00:52:27,784 --> 00:52:29,775
Well, I heard you had a day job

550
00:52:31,654 --> 00:52:32,951
I'm saving for a car

551
00:52:33,222 --> 00:52:36,783
Well, I'm leaving town for good so

552
00:52:37,226 --> 00:52:39,160
I wanted to take care of a few things

553
00:52:39,395 --> 00:52:42,728
Arnie's tab came out to eight hundred dollars

554
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:46,768
I guess you can give it to Travis and

555
00:52:47,003 --> 00:52:48,402
he can mark the debt paid

556
00:52:49,972 --> 00:52:51,837
I'll give it to Travis tonight

557
00:52:53,009 --> 00:52:55,102
Shock might give him a heart attack

558
00:53:10,893 --> 00:53:12,952
I have a favor to ask you

559
00:53:16,532 --> 00:53:18,397
Could you keep his bill hanging?

560
00:53:21,804 --> 00:53:23,738
So they don't forget him too soon?

561
00:53:28,377 --> 00:53:29,241
OK

562
00:53:59,809 --> 00:54:03,404
I guess for Sue Lynne, leaving this town was like dying

563
00:54:07,283 --> 00:54:09,843
I wonder how people would remember Arnie

564
00:54:12,421 --> 00:54:15,117
When you're gone, all that's left behind are the memories

565
00:54:15,424 --> 00:54:17,221
you created in other people's lives

566
00:54:19,962 --> 00:54:22,260
or just a couple of items on a bill

567
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:33,573
I began receiving postcards from her regularly

568
00:54:34,543 --> 00:54:38,775
Instead of calling strangers, I decided to change my strategy

569
00:54:40,049 --> 00:54:42,950
It was tiring writing the same words over and over again

570
00:54:43,686 --> 00:54:46,348
but all worth it if only one of them reached her

571
00:55:05,007 --> 00:55:08,033
I always had the feeling I could say anything to you.

572
00:55:09,812 --> 00:55:12,303
Enclosed is a bill I've created for you

573
00:55:12,515 --> 00:55:14,346
in memory of our time together

574
00:55:16,886 --> 00:55:19,116
I wonder how you remember me

575
00:55:22,024 --> 00:55:24,549
As the girl who liked blueberry pies

576
00:55:28,230 --> 00:55:30,164
or the girl with the broken heart?

577
00:55:33,202 --> 00:55:35,693

578
00:56:54,517 --> 00:56:56,382
Still rolling your own cigarettes?

579
00:57:02,324 --> 00:57:03,291
You want one?

580
00:57:04,226 --> 00:57:05,193
Yeah

581
00:57:20,476 --> 00:57:21,875
Tastes different

582
00:57:23,079 --> 00:57:25,240
It's probably just been in my pocket too long

583
00:57:30,352 --> 00:57:33,150
It's a shame you can't smoke in cafes anymore

584
00:57:33,456 --> 00:57:35,151
You can't smoke anywhere anymore

585
00:57:36,992 --> 00:57:38,960
You should've changed the place

586
00:57:39,728 --> 00:57:41,628
It's not that much different

587
00:57:42,431 --> 00:57:43,898
I've been meaning to buy new chairs

588
00:57:44,133 --> 00:57:45,623
but I couldn't never find any that match

589
00:57:46,469 --> 00:57:48,096
the tables and the tiles

590
00:57:48,971 --> 00:57:50,199
Shouldn't be hard

591
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:53,704
Maybe you're just looking in the wrong places or

592
00:57:54,009 --> 00:57:56,239
maybe you're just sentimental

593
00:58:00,816 --> 00:58:02,215
You look lovely

594
00:58:02,518 --> 00:58:04,452
I'm starting to look like my mom

595
00:58:04,653 --> 00:58:06,211
It's better than looking like your dad

596
00:58:06,455 --> 00:58:07,683
I've seen photos of him

597
00:58:17,566 --> 00:58:19,329
You still have the keys?

598
00:58:21,604 --> 00:58:24,437
Yeah... I always remember what you said

599
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:26,733
about never throwing them away, about never

600
00:58:27,042 --> 00:58:29,943
closing those doors forever. I remember

601
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:34,772
Sometimes, even if you have the keys

602
00:58:35,551 --> 00:58:37,348
those doors still

603
00:58:37,887 --> 00:58:40,048
can't be opened, can they?

604
00:58:43,259 --> 00:58:45,022
Even if the door is open

605
00:58:45,261 --> 00:58:47,752
the person you're looking for may not be there, Katya

606
00:58:55,304 --> 00:58:57,534
A few years ago, I had a dream

607
00:58:59,341 --> 00:59:00,968
It began in the summer

608
00:59:01,310 --> 00:59:03,574
and was over by the following spring

609
00:59:05,915 --> 00:59:08,475
In between, there was as many unhappy nights

610
00:59:08,784 --> 00:59:10,217
as there were happy days

611
00:59:11,353 --> 00:59:14,083
Most of them took place in this cafe

612
00:59:17,159 --> 00:59:18,524
And then one night

613
00:59:18,727 --> 00:59:20,854
a door slammed and the dream was over

614
00:59:38,447 --> 00:59:40,108
I should be going

615
00:59:40,950 --> 00:59:43,214
I have to catch a flight in the morning

616
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:46,120
Thanks for the smoke.

617
00:59:54,496 --> 00:59:56,794
You know, I didn't even think you'd still be here

618
00:59:57,833 --> 00:59:58,925
Why'd you come?

619
01:00:03,572 --> 01:00:07,531
I guess I just wanted to see if I could remember

620
01:00:08,143 --> 01:00:09,701
what it felt like

621
01:00:21,857 --> 01:00:23,449
Goodbye, Jeremy

622
01:00:32,167 --> 01:00:33,327
Bye, Katya

623
01:00:46,749 --> 01:00:49,343

624
01:00:49,852 --> 01:00:50,784
Cocktails?

625
01:00:51,153 --> 01:00:52,177
A screwdriver, please

626
01:00:52,421 --> 01:00:53,115
Here you go

627
01:00:53,322 --> 01:00:54,550
Dear Jeremy

628
01:00:55,758 --> 01:00:58,454
I've always been fascinated by card players

629
01:00:59,762 --> 01:01:02,697
They risk everything on their instincts and their luck

630
01:01:04,533 --> 01:01:06,558
I wonder if I would be able to make the same moves

631
01:01:06,869 --> 01:01:08,200
in their position

632
01:01:09,505 --> 01:01:11,268
Or would I just fold?

633
01:01:13,342 --> 01:01:15,310
Sweetheart, do you mind?

634
01:01:18,681 --> 01:01:21,206
Uh-oh look at that

635
01:01:21,650 --> 01:01:23,242
She gets another one this kid

636
01:01:23,519 --> 01:01:24,543
You know Leslie you got that fancy Jag

637
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:26,285
you working on a Rolls Royce now?

638
01:01:27,823 --> 01:01:31,088
Aloha, you forgot to tip the waitress

639
01:01:31,460 --> 01:01:33,087
Actually I didn't forget dick

640
01:01:33,429 --> 01:01:34,327
Because I never tip

641
01:01:34,563 --> 01:01:36,087
What do you mean you never tip?

642
01:01:36,365 --> 01:01:37,730
I mean Harlan can afford to pay his own people

643
01:01:38,033 --> 01:01:38,795
I don't know why I have to

644
01:01:39,001 --> 01:01:40,468
You can be cheap or you can be lucky

645
01:01:40,703 --> 01:01:43,263
but you can't be both. Not in the long run

646
01:01:43,539 --> 01:01:45,029
Here ya go, toots

647
01:01:45,341 --> 01:01:47,832
That is from Mr. Aloha over there

648
01:01:48,310 --> 01:01:50,540
He's gonna pay me back, he doesn't know it yet

649
01:01:51,580 --> 01:01:52,410
Thanks

650
01:01:52,648 --> 01:01:54,172
Your luck just went south

651
01:01:55,484 --> 01:01:56,678
Who's blinds?

652
01:01:58,087 --> 01:02:01,682
Working long hours in the casino makes you lose track of the time

653
01:02:03,492 --> 01:02:06,052
And I'm never sure whether it's day or night

654
01:02:07,429 --> 01:02:11,195
But at least I don't have to worry about my sleeping problem anymore

655
01:02:12,568 --> 01:02:14,900
Somehow it's gone away

656
01:02:24,613 --> 01:02:26,274
How much you got left, sweet cheeks?

657
01:02:26,482 --> 01:02:27,540
Because that's what I bet

658
01:02:31,887 --> 01:02:33,081
Eighteen-twenty

659
01:02:35,858 --> 01:02:37,723
You on a big draw, Aloha?

660
01:02:38,227 --> 01:02:40,525
Because otherwise you're just about dead

661
01:02:52,007 --> 01:02:53,702
You are on a big draw

662
01:02:54,176 --> 01:02:55,666
Twelve outs twice

663
01:02:56,145 --> 01:02:57,305
You wanna do business?

664
01:02:57,613 --> 01:02:58,637
Make me an offer

665
01:02:58,881 --> 01:03:00,940
How about you take six hundred and I take a thousand

666
01:03:01,316 --> 01:03:02,510
and we gamble for the rest?

667
01:03:03,585 --> 01:03:04,847
I say I need more than that

668
01:03:05,053 --> 01:03:06,213
Doesn't seem fair to you?

669
01:03:06,455 --> 01:03:07,422
I feel like gambling

670
01:03:07,656 --> 01:03:08,816
So what do you want me to do?

671
01:03:09,258 --> 01:03:10,486
You heard the man.

672
01:03:11,093 --> 01:03:13,561
He wants to gamble. Deal

673
01:03:17,132 --> 01:03:20,590
Bet you wish you took that six hundred now,huh Aloha?

674
01:03:21,437 --> 01:03:23,337
Don't get too cocky little girl

675
01:03:23,539 --> 01:03:25,029
Five of hearts still in that deck

676
01:03:25,340 --> 01:03:26,466
Oh come on

677
01:03:27,609 --> 01:03:30,373
We can all dream, Aloha

678
01:03:30,846 --> 01:03:32,040
I wish you luck

679
01:03:33,348 --> 01:03:34,144
Why don't you deal the card?

680
01:03:34,316 --> 01:03:35,112
Fine

681
01:03:39,321 --> 01:03:41,585
Wait, wait, how did you do that?

682
01:03:42,257 --> 01:03:43,656
Ok I swear I wasn't cheating

683
01:03:44,026 --> 01:03:45,152
I had the deck in my hand

684
01:03:46,762 --> 01:03:48,423
Pass it to the sugardaddy here

685
01:03:48,997 --> 01:03:50,624
I'm telling my grandkids about that one

686
01:03:56,305 --> 01:03:57,636
Maybe

687
01:03:59,208 --> 01:04:02,006
A salad. That'd be healthy, right?

688
01:04:02,344 --> 01:04:04,335
I don't think I could get it down though

689
01:04:04,546 --> 01:04:06,138
All that chewing and swallowing

690
01:04:08,083 --> 01:04:10,244
Maybe I'll get some eggs

691
01:04:11,119 --> 01:04:12,313
Protein, right?

692
01:04:12,588 --> 01:04:13,612
How would you like them?

693
01:04:13,822 --> 01:04:16,052
Tied in a knot and nailed to the floor

694
01:04:16,425 --> 01:04:18,655
Or maybe you can just crack 'em over my head

695
01:04:19,027 --> 01:04:20,654
and let 'em trickle down my cheeks

696
01:04:24,233 --> 01:04:25,393
Beth

697
01:04:26,902 --> 01:04:29,166
Why don't I just go ask them right now?

698
01:04:32,841 --> 01:04:36,277
So who is gonna lend me a grand so I can get back in?

699
01:04:37,346 --> 01:04:40,645
Sam, come on, this is me we're talking about

700
01:04:41,383 --> 01:04:44,819
Why can't you just advance me the cash

701
01:04:45,053 --> 01:04:47,851
and I will wire you back the money within 24 hours

702
01:04:48,090 --> 01:04:50,251
You won't even have a chance to miss it

703
01:04:51,660 --> 01:04:52,786
Yeah?

704
01:04:53,161 --> 01:04:54,924
Well fuck you very much!

705
01:04:59,401 --> 01:05:00,629
Rough night, huh?

706
01:05:00,836 --> 01:05:02,133
You could say that

707
01:05:05,807 --> 01:05:07,536
How did you wind up in this hellhole?

708
01:05:07,776 --> 01:05:09,437
The bus just dropped me off here

709
01:05:09,678 --> 01:05:10,508
Where'd you come from?

710
01:05:10,712 --> 01:05:11,610
New York

711
01:05:11,847 --> 01:05:14,509
You came all the way here from New York on a bus?

712
01:05:15,117 --> 01:05:16,311
Sounds awful

713
01:05:17,619 --> 01:05:19,883
Actually, I was on quite a few of them

714
01:05:21,089 --> 01:05:22,784
You must love buses

715
01:05:23,292 --> 01:05:25,226
I wanna get a car but

716
01:05:25,794 --> 01:05:27,557
it's not easy saving money

717
01:05:28,263 --> 01:05:29,628
How much you got?

718
01:05:29,898 --> 01:05:32,560
About twenty-one, twenty-two hundred

719
01:05:37,739 --> 01:05:38,899
Hey Beth

720
01:05:41,944 --> 01:05:43,878
I've got a proposition for you

721
01:05:44,112 --> 01:05:45,636
What kind of proposition?

722
01:05:46,014 --> 01:05:47,606
See, I need a stake

723
01:05:48,984 --> 01:05:50,611
There's a man I could call in Vegas

724
01:05:50,919 --> 01:05:52,819
but I don't want to do that

725
01:05:53,255 --> 01:05:55,018
I'm gonna win that game

726
01:05:55,257 --> 01:05:57,350
I'm a stronger player than any of them

727
01:05:58,627 --> 01:06:01,323
If you give me a chance I'm gonna clean their clocks.

728
01:06:04,533 --> 01:06:06,000
How much do you need?

729
01:06:06,635 --> 01:06:09,126
Well your twenty two hundred would get me back in

730
01:06:09,738 --> 01:06:12,332
And then, once I cash out

731
01:06:13,508 --> 01:06:16,409
you'll get your money back plus a third of my winnings

732
01:06:17,012 --> 01:06:18,411
But what if you lose?

733
01:06:20,482 --> 01:06:24,418
If I lose, you get my car

734
01:06:25,253 --> 01:06:26,914
It's a brand new Jag

735
01:06:27,155 --> 01:06:28,452
This way

736
01:06:28,824 --> 01:06:29,916
whatever happens

737
01:06:30,158 --> 01:06:32,524
you've got your ass covered from here to Houston

738
01:06:36,898 --> 01:06:38,763
You got to give me a minute here

739
01:06:39,301 --> 01:06:40,734
It's been a long night

740
01:06:45,841 --> 01:06:48,401
I got an empty stomach. Just give me a minute

741
01:06:48,710 --> 01:06:49,972
You take your time

742
01:06:50,212 --> 01:06:52,680
I wouldn't want you choking on your food

743
01:06:55,150 --> 01:06:56,344
Shit it's cold!

744
01:06:56,551 --> 01:06:57,575
I know

745
01:07:31,787 --> 01:07:32,913
I'll do it

746
01:07:34,456 --> 01:07:36,014
Oh my, look who's back

747
01:07:36,925 --> 01:07:39,792
I thought you'd be halfway to Vegas in that fancy ass Jag of yours

748
01:07:40,028 --> 01:07:43,259
I figure why not let you pay for my gas

749
01:08:07,589 --> 01:08:09,022
Gotta raise again

750
01:08:10,625 --> 01:08:11,887
Five hundred

751
01:08:16,264 --> 01:08:17,959
Oh one of these days one of us is going to have

752
01:08:18,366 --> 01:08:19,628
something when you raise!

753
01:08:19,901 --> 01:08:22,165
Listen, why don't you just wink at me when that happens

754
01:08:22,504 --> 01:08:23,698
so I know, alright?

755
01:09:13,522 --> 01:09:14,386
Raise

756
01:09:17,492 --> 01:09:18,652
I'm all in

757
01:09:27,269 --> 01:09:28,634
You want to give me a count on that?

758
01:09:30,238 --> 01:09:33,401
Fifteen... Fifteen thirty-five

759
01:09:37,779 --> 01:09:38,939
Too rich for me

760
01:09:51,927 --> 01:09:53,087
I don't know what's worse

761
01:09:53,495 --> 01:09:55,258
That cute smile or that ugly shirt

762
01:09:59,467 --> 01:10:01,025
I'll give you some action

763
01:10:10,478 --> 01:10:11,410
Hey

764
01:10:13,815 --> 01:10:15,248
Hey, what happened?

765
01:10:16,117 --> 01:10:17,311
The car's yours

766
01:10:19,054 --> 01:10:20,715
You've got to give me a ride though

767
01:10:33,335 --> 01:10:34,359
So where we going?

768
01:10:34,569 --> 01:10:35,536
Vegas

769
01:10:42,010 --> 01:10:44,706
She said she knew some people in Vegas who could stake her

770
01:10:45,180 --> 01:10:46,579
get her started again

771
01:10:47,415 --> 01:10:49,906
But she didn't seem to be in a hurry to get there

772
01:10:56,458 --> 01:10:58,619
Hey Leslie, are you asleep?

773
01:11:00,228 --> 01:11:01,320
No

774
01:11:01,696 --> 01:11:04,790
I keep playing old poker hands in my head

775
01:11:06,301 --> 01:11:07,393
You?

776
01:11:07,802 --> 01:11:08,996
Same

777
01:11:09,838 --> 01:11:11,203
Except for the poker

778
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:13,130
What are you replaying?

779
01:11:14,643 --> 01:11:17,237
Just some stuff that happened back in New York

780
01:11:21,483 --> 01:11:23,883
Hey, the man you told me about in Vegas

781
01:11:24,119 --> 01:11:25,313
that could give you the money

782
01:11:25,921 --> 01:11:26,910
Yeah?

783
01:11:28,223 --> 01:11:29,087
Is he a boyfriend?

784
01:11:30,659 --> 01:11:31,683
No

785
01:11:32,661 --> 01:11:35,186
I haven't had very much luck with boyfriends

786
01:11:35,530 --> 01:11:36,724
I've had a few but

787
01:11:36,998 --> 01:11:39,489
none that I could ever ask for anything, let alone money

788
01:11:43,438 --> 01:11:46,464
Now you want to know who the man in Vegas is

789
01:11:46,841 --> 01:11:48,240
but you're too polite to ask

790
01:11:48,476 --> 01:11:49,465
No

791
01:11:50,845 --> 01:11:52,278
It's not important

792
01:11:54,182 --> 01:11:55,410
He's my father

793
01:11:56,284 --> 01:11:58,218
Taught me how to play poker

794
01:12:00,789 --> 01:12:02,814
He had me figuring odds around the same time

795
01:12:03,058 --> 01:12:05,026
other kids were learning how to count

796
01:12:05,794 --> 01:12:07,227
He used to tell people

797
01:12:07,462 --> 01:12:10,022
that I thought the number that came after ten

798
01:12:10,298 --> 01:12:11,458
was Jack

799
01:12:14,369 --> 01:12:18,772
So I can ask him for money or anything, but

800
01:12:21,509 --> 01:12:22,533
I won't

801
01:12:35,857 --> 01:12:39,623
Trust everyone but always cut the cards

802
01:12:39,794 --> 01:12:41,853
Best thing my father ever taught me

803
01:12:42,664 --> 01:12:44,029
You know what that means?

804
01:12:44,232 --> 01:12:46,894
It means never trust anybody

805
01:12:48,003 --> 01:12:49,436
If you're so good at reading people

806
01:12:49,671 --> 01:12:50,501
Then why did I lose?

807
01:12:50,672 --> 01:12:51,639
Yeah

808
01:12:51,973 --> 01:12:53,838
Because you can't always win

809
01:12:54,175 --> 01:12:56,700
You can beat players but you can't beat luck

810
01:12:57,679 --> 01:12:59,408
Sometimes your rhythm's off

811
01:12:59,848 --> 01:13:02,408
you read the person right but still do the wrong thing

812
01:13:02,684 --> 01:13:03,651
Because you trust them?

813
01:13:04,252 --> 01:13:06,618
Because you can't even trust yourself

814
01:13:07,522 --> 01:13:08,489
Shit

815
01:13:11,226 --> 01:13:12,659
Nobody I want to hear from

816
01:13:12,894 --> 01:13:13,553
Nobody?

817
01:13:13,828 --> 01:13:14,886
Nobody!

818
01:13:30,311 --> 01:13:31,869
How did you get this number?

819
01:13:32,147 --> 01:13:34,945
You know this is the third time this month I've have change it?

820
01:13:35,483 --> 01:13:37,917
Just leave me the hell alone! Stop calling!

821
01:13:41,056 --> 01:13:42,114
Dammit!

822
01:13:42,590 --> 01:13:44,182
Beth, answer it for me

823
01:13:44,826 --> 01:13:45,793
What do you want me to say?

824
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:48,087
Tell them its the wrong number and not to call again

825
01:13:48,296 --> 01:13:49,228
Okay

826
01:13:50,665 --> 01:13:51,757
Hello?

827
01:13:52,801 --> 01:13:54,291
Sorry, you have-

828
01:13:55,403 --> 01:13:56,631
From where?

829
01:13:58,339 --> 01:13:59,465
Okay

830
01:14:01,176 --> 01:14:03,041
Okay... you sure?

831
01:14:04,379 --> 01:14:06,813
Okay, thank you... bye

832
01:14:09,784 --> 01:14:12,082
It was someone from a hospital in Vegas

833
01:14:13,455 --> 01:14:15,150
They said your dad's there

834
01:14:16,157 --> 01:14:17,749
And they said he's dying

835
01:14:20,829 --> 01:14:21,989
Son of a bitch

836
01:14:23,531 --> 01:14:26,056
That man... always dying

837
01:14:35,577 --> 01:14:37,169
It's a trick, okay?

838
01:14:38,046 --> 01:14:39,741
He's pulled this on me before

839
01:14:40,181 --> 01:14:42,115
Says he has to see me, he's dying

840
01:14:42,350 --> 01:14:43,214
And then

841
01:14:43,551 --> 01:14:45,416
you know how many times I've fallen for that?

842
01:14:45,620 --> 01:14:47,918
But it was someone from the hospital that called it wasn't him

843
01:14:48,223 --> 01:14:49,315
So what Beth?

844
01:14:49,958 --> 01:14:51,255
You think he couldn't pay someone

845
01:14:51,526 --> 01:14:53,084
to make the phone call for him?

846
01:14:54,329 --> 01:14:57,492
I swear, is there anyone you don't trust?

847
01:14:58,833 --> 01:15:01,529
Well he must really want to see you to make up a story like that

848
01:15:27,162 --> 01:15:29,995
Geez, you are just dying to ask me something

849
01:15:30,465 --> 01:15:31,022
What?

850
01:15:31,332 --> 01:15:32,128
I didn't say anything

851
01:15:32,367 --> 01:15:34,130
You didn't have to. I can read you

852
01:15:34,369 --> 01:15:35,768
I can even guess what you wanna ask

853
01:15:37,472 --> 01:15:38,598
You wanna ask

854
01:15:39,874 --> 01:15:42,707
"What if he is dying? " "What if the message is legit? "

855
01:15:43,044 --> 01:15:44,011
Well what if he is?

856
01:15:47,949 --> 01:15:49,610
The thing is Beth

857
01:15:50,118 --> 01:15:51,380
I don't care

858
01:15:51,853 --> 01:15:53,343
He lives, he dies

859
01:15:54,222 --> 01:15:55,519
whatever

860
01:15:56,157 --> 01:15:57,715
I don't fucking care

861
01:16:07,302 --> 01:16:08,599
You're lying

862
01:16:30,892 --> 01:16:31,824
I'm not going in there

863
01:16:32,026 --> 01:16:32,754
What?

864
01:16:33,094 --> 01:16:35,585
I can't. What- what if I go in there

865
01:16:35,863 --> 01:16:38,491
and he's just sitting up in his room

866
01:16:38,833 --> 01:16:41,028
with his dead beat friends playing gin rummy

867
01:16:41,302 --> 01:16:45,534
or, I dunno, detoxing, getting a mole removed

868
01:16:45,873 --> 01:16:46,897
You know it's more serious than that

869
01:16:47,141 --> 01:16:49,200
No, I don't know that and neither do you

870
01:16:53,381 --> 01:16:56,248
Listen, you do me a favor. You go in there for me

871
01:16:56,484 --> 01:16:57,416
Me?

872
01:16:58,319 --> 01:16:59,411
Why me?

873
01:17:00,221 --> 01:17:03,816
Because you are safe. There's no way he can hurt you

874
01:17:04,626 --> 01:17:06,389
Go, c'mon

875
01:17:14,168 --> 01:17:15,100
Fine

876
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:27,377
I am sorry

877
01:17:28,149 --> 01:17:29,741
You know we tried to phone a couple days

878
01:17:29,984 --> 01:17:31,417
but couldn't seem to reach you

879
01:17:32,654 --> 01:17:33,916
He was-

880
01:17:34,289 --> 01:17:35,984
You should've come earlier

881
01:17:45,300 --> 01:17:46,892
He put you up to this!?

882
01:17:48,169 --> 01:17:49,534
How much he pay you huh!?

883
01:17:49,737 --> 01:17:50,726
Jesus

884
01:17:51,272 --> 01:17:52,967
You're so good at reading people?

885
01:17:53,241 --> 01:17:54,799
Can't you see it in my face!?

886
01:17:56,844 --> 01:17:58,971
Leslie, he's gone!

887
01:18:03,785 --> 01:18:05,184
You're lying

888
01:19:14,489 --> 01:19:15,615
Beth

889
01:19:17,158 --> 01:19:18,420
I can't give you the car

890
01:19:21,396 --> 01:19:22,385
Why?

891
01:19:23,631 --> 01:19:24,996
Because the car

892
01:19:27,668 --> 01:19:29,431
the car belonged to my father

893
01:19:33,174 --> 01:19:36,871
Look, he won big one day in a Hold'em game at the Riviera, and

894
01:19:38,713 --> 01:19:41,147
went out and bought the next day

895
01:19:41,382 --> 01:19:42,974
It was his pride and joy

896
01:19:45,753 --> 01:19:49,621
Til one day I stole his keys, and an hour later I stole his car

897
01:19:50,758 --> 01:19:52,350
I don't know why I did it

898
01:19:52,693 --> 01:19:53,751
Maybe I just

899
01:19:54,429 --> 01:19:56,454
wanted to see what he would do, you know?

900
01:19:56,731 --> 01:19:57,925
Was he gonna report it?

901
01:19:58,399 --> 01:20:00,367
Get his daughter arrested?

902
01:20:04,605 --> 01:20:06,539
He did something better than that

903
01:20:07,141 --> 01:20:09,735
He waited until he found out where I wound up

904
01:20:10,044 --> 01:20:11,102
One morning

905
01:20:11,345 --> 01:20:13,779
a FedEx guy comes with an envelope for me

906
01:20:14,015 --> 01:20:16,950
Inside the envelope's the title and registration of the car

907
01:20:21,289 --> 01:20:23,757
Son of a bitch signed it over to me

908
01:20:26,727 --> 01:20:27,785
So

909
01:20:28,529 --> 01:20:31,396
I'm gonna drive this car until it falls apart

910
01:20:31,666 --> 01:20:32,997
At least until I do

911
01:20:38,873 --> 01:20:40,841
So what am I supposed to?

912
01:20:42,076 --> 01:20:44,567
Well, Beth

913
01:20:45,746 --> 01:20:48,909
I told you I lost everything back at Harlan's, didn't I?

914
01:20:49,150 --> 01:20:50,174
Yeah

915
01:20:50,418 --> 01:20:53,512
Well, that's not exactly how it went down

916
01:20:54,755 --> 01:20:57,815
See, I beat that game on its ass, Beth

917
01:20:58,860 --> 01:21:01,192
I knocked them off their feet

918
01:21:02,230 --> 01:21:04,960
The cards turned just like I knew they would

919
01:21:05,233 --> 01:21:07,428
I read the other players just right

920
01:21:10,471 --> 01:21:12,496
I walked away with all their money

921
01:21:13,007 --> 01:21:14,269
So you lied to me

922
01:21:16,677 --> 01:21:18,474
Maybe I didn't want to share

923
01:21:19,046 --> 01:21:22,413
Maybe I just wanted to see how trusting and gullible you were

924
01:21:24,619 --> 01:21:27,611
Maybe I just wanted company. You know?

925
01:21:27,922 --> 01:21:29,583
It's a long ride, Beth

926
01:21:31,459 --> 01:21:33,222
I didn't want to go alone

927
01:22:12,433 --> 01:22:14,560
Can't do it. Thirty-five hundred's the best I can give ya

928
01:22:14,769 --> 01:22:16,964
Three thousand. That's my top

929
01:22:17,238 --> 01:22:19,570
Can't. Gotta have thirty-five hundred. Sorry

930
01:22:19,807 --> 01:22:21,365
Thirty-two hundred. Take it or leave it

931
01:22:21,642 --> 01:22:22,267
You know what?

932
01:22:22,510 --> 01:22:25,070
I'm sure we can find a better deal someplace else. Let's go

933
01:22:25,413 --> 01:22:27,472
I don't think you will, ladies. Suit yourselves

934
01:22:27,682 --> 01:22:28,649
Thank you!

935
01:22:30,585 --> 01:22:31,552
Don't look back

936
01:22:31,919 --> 01:22:32,783
Beth, where are you going?

937
01:22:33,054 --> 01:22:33,850
I want that car

938
01:22:34,055 --> 01:22:34,987
Beth not at that price!

939
01:22:35,389 --> 01:22:37,914
We can get it for three grand by the time we get to my car

940
01:22:38,759 --> 01:22:40,454
I don't think he's gonna come down

941
01:22:40,728 --> 01:22:42,787
And I think that's the car I want

942
01:22:43,898 --> 01:22:46,867
Have you learned nothing from your time with me?

943
01:22:47,435 --> 01:22:49,903
You have to stop taking people at their word!

944
01:22:50,838 --> 01:22:52,237
Maybe you should start

945
01:22:55,009 --> 01:22:56,408
You're hopeless

946
01:22:57,612 --> 01:22:58,772
You're hopeless too

947
01:23:15,596 --> 01:23:16,893
Dear Jeremy

948
01:23:17,465 --> 01:23:21,128
In the last few days, I've been learning how to not trust people

949
01:23:21,636 --> 01:23:23,228
and I'm glad I failed

950
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:36,306
Sometimes we depend on other people as a mirror

951
01:23:36,584 --> 01:23:39,280
To define us and tell us who we are

952
01:23:41,055 --> 01:23:44,286
And each reflection makes me like myself a little more

953
01:23:45,693 --> 01:23:47,160
Elizabeth

954
01:24:12,787 --> 01:24:14,152
Hello, Cafe Klyuch

955
01:24:14,422 --> 01:24:16,754

956
01:24:54,195 --> 01:24:56,720
Rent

957
01:25:42,176 --> 01:25:43,404
You still open?

958
01:25:44,178 --> 01:25:46,510
No reason for me to still be here if I wasn't

959
01:25:48,582 --> 01:25:51,244
I heard this place has the best coffee and pie in town

960
01:25:51,519 --> 01:25:52,417
Where'd you hear that?

961
01:25:53,554 --> 01:25:54,885
I get around

962
01:25:58,392 --> 01:25:59,586
You wanna come inside?

963
01:26:01,295 --> 01:26:02,227
It's cold

964
01:26:02,730 --> 01:26:04,493
What are you doing out here? It's freezing

965
01:26:04,732 --> 01:26:07,030
It's a beautiful night. I wanted to get some fresh air

966
01:26:08,536 --> 01:26:09,662
Have a seat

967
01:26:14,542 --> 01:26:15,975
Isn't this reserved?

968
01:26:16,744 --> 01:26:17,870
Reserved for you

969
01:26:24,084 --> 01:26:25,381
Want something to eat?

970
01:26:27,755 --> 01:26:29,848
Yeah, I'm starving

971
01:26:31,091 --> 01:26:32,353
What's good tonight?

972
01:26:33,460 --> 01:26:35,223
What about a steak?

973
01:26:36,263 --> 01:26:37,457
That sounds good

974
01:26:38,732 --> 01:26:39,960
Does it come with home fries?

975
01:26:40,167 --> 01:26:41,191
Or mashed

976
01:26:41,502 --> 01:26:42,662
They both sound good

977
01:26:43,204 --> 01:26:44,535
Half an order of both?

978
01:26:46,207 --> 01:26:48,607
I'll get the home fries with the steak, medium rare

979
01:26:48,876 --> 01:26:50,969
and a side of mashed potatoes

980
01:26:51,312 --> 01:26:52,506
Coming right up

981
01:27:05,092 --> 01:27:06,753
Learning something about me?

982
01:27:08,662 --> 01:27:10,493
There's something different about you

983
01:27:10,931 --> 01:27:12,523
Or maybe it's me that's changed

984
01:27:15,369 --> 01:27:16,802
Where are the keys?

985
01:27:17,004 --> 01:27:18,335
You don't keep them anymore?

986
01:27:20,207 --> 01:27:22,334
Been trying to give them back to their owners

987
01:27:22,710 --> 01:27:23,734
Do you want yours?

988
01:27:23,978 --> 01:27:26,606
No. I don't need them anymore

989
01:27:29,450 --> 01:27:30,747
What about your keys?

990
01:27:33,287 --> 01:27:34,515
I got rid of them

991
01:27:37,892 --> 01:27:38,881
Good night, Jeremy

992
01:27:39,126 --> 01:27:40,286
I'll see you tomorrow

993
01:27:55,175 --> 01:27:57,302
You know I came here the night I left

994
01:27:58,012 --> 01:28:00,139
but I didn't make it past the front door

995
01:28:03,984 --> 01:28:07,078
I almost walked in but I knew that if I did

996
01:28:07,354 --> 01:28:10,118
I would just be the same old Elizabeth

997
01:28:11,525 --> 01:28:13,550
I didn't want to be that person anymore

998
01:28:28,375 --> 01:28:29,569
Hope you enjoy it

999
01:28:39,687 --> 01:28:42,019
Are they still left untouched at the end of the night?

1000
01:28:42,289 --> 01:28:44,052
Yep, more or less

1001
01:28:46,093 --> 01:28:48,118
Then why do you keep making them?

1002
01:28:51,865 --> 01:28:54,163
Well I always like having one around just in case

1003
01:28:54,635 --> 01:28:57,229
you pop in and fancy a slice

1004
01:29:02,643 --> 01:29:04,941
Do you remember that last night you were here?

1005
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:09,348
When you practically ate an entire pie all by yourself?

1006
01:29:10,584 --> 01:29:11,642
Really?

1007
01:29:13,587 --> 01:29:16,317
I remember getting really drunk and

1008
01:29:16,623 --> 01:29:19,353
having a god awful hangover the next day

1009
01:29:20,294 --> 01:29:21,488
Nothing else?

1010
01:29:24,164 --> 01:29:26,598
No, nothing else

1011
01:29:31,905 --> 01:29:34,135
Or don't you have a tape I can watch?

1012
01:29:35,943 --> 01:29:37,877
I do... but...

1013
01:29:38,612 --> 01:29:40,170
I've watched it so many times

1014
01:29:40,414 --> 01:29:42,177
that the picture started fading to black and white

1015
01:29:42,516 --> 01:29:44,848
And now it's completely unwatchable

1016
01:29:45,019 --> 01:29:46,145
Must have been an interesting night

1017
01:29:46,220 --> 01:29:47,187
It was

1018
01:29:53,594 --> 01:29:55,960
Never seen a girl eat so much in all my life

1019
01:29:59,133 --> 01:30:00,259
Like this?

1020
01:30:03,704 --> 01:30:05,228
No, it was more like this

1021
01:30:13,514 --> 01:30:14,913
It's good pie

1022
01:31:42,636 --> 01:31:45,366
It took me nearly a year to get here

1023
01:31:47,741 --> 01:31:50,710
It wasn't so hard to cross that street afterall

1024
01:31:52,212 --> 01:31:55,477
It all depends on who's waiting for you on the other side

1025
01:31:56,305 --> 01:32:02,839
