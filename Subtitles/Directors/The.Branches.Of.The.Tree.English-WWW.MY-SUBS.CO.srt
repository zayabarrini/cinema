2
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:19,277
Come, I know you sit in
this room every morning.

3
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,751
That's why I did not go to
the garden and came here.

4
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,470
I have not spoken
to you for a long time.

5
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:38,275
Looking at the flowers? You know
today is a big day, Proshanto?

6
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,434
Your father is seventy years old today.

7
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,558
You don't have to remember that.

8
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,754
Leave it... leave it... Sit...

9
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,952
Why are you going over there?
I do not often meet you.

10
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,669
Sometimes I forget that
you are even staying here.

11
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,036
Where are they?

12
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:13,539
Your brothers wanted to
come but I stopped them.

13
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:23,277
All of them work. There is no
need to leave work and come.

14
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,919
Everybody works...
- What did you say?

15
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:34,518
Everybody works...
- You too used to...

16
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,062
You had bad luck, Proshanto...

17
00:03:38,063 --> 00:03:41,433
Do you know why you don't work?

18
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,390
You had been abroad to
study Minerology. Remember?

19
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:59,793
Wait...
if I can make you remember...

20
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:05,914
Saying "I don't work... I don't work"...
No need to feel sad about it.

21
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,933
Listen, listen carefully...

22
00:04:17,934 --> 00:04:20,475
Abroad... London...

23
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,498
You met with an accident. You had

24
00:04:24,499 --> 00:04:28,235
a severe head injury... Remember?

25
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,423
Doctor... Hopkins...

26
00:04:37,824 --> 00:04:42,352
Right. Hopkins saved you.

27
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,835
There was no hope of survival.

28
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:49,552
What a horrible time it was...

29
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:57,248
Your mother didn't even touch water
for ten days.

30
00:04:57,249 --> 00:04:59,553
I only saw darkness.

31
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:05,352
The moment we knew,
we made all the arrangements.

32
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,263
Passport... Tickets...

33
00:05:09,264 --> 00:05:14,278
Two days before leaving... A miracle...

34
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:20,633
We got news. The difficult time
was over and there was no fear.

35
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,630
You started recovering,

36
00:05:26,631 --> 00:05:32,196
returning to normalcy...
and got back home...

37
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:38,259
But, you couldn't work. Doctors tried...

38
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:41,632
but something was missing...

39
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,796
God gave us a lot...
and so we made our peace...

40
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:51,038
Among four brothers,
you were the most brilliant.

41
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:56,752
And only you said you will
live here and work here.

42
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,913
They never wanted to stay,
I never insisted.

43
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,351
You remained,
but as a different person.

44
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:11,358
Please do not mind Proshanto.

45
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,993
It's alright the way you live. You stay
in your room, listen to music...

46
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,678
I remember everything...
- What's that?

47
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:25,066
The tune, the music...

48
00:06:25,067 --> 00:06:31,037
Lots and lots of tunes...
It stays with me...

49
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,035
What's that tune?
Whose is it?

50
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,870
Maybe I won't understand...

51
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:25,115
No Sir... No Sir...
- You are still naughty.

52
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,796
Your friend Himanshu sent records
from abroad. Did you like them?

53
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,232
And how's the music system your
brothers gave you for your birthday?

54
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,192
Very good.
Very good...

55
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,074
What is called?
I really do not know...

56
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,514
Hi fi... Hi fi.

57
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:51,040
Maybe...
You know what they gave me?

58
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:55,190
Kashmiri shawl, silk sheets,

59
00:07:55,191 --> 00:07:58,238
Tussar payjama kurta...

60
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:03,759
A dhoti set with the
latest fashion big border.

61
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:09,471
And your sister-in law
knitted a woollen pullover too.

62
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:14,111
Manilal had been to Calcutta.
They sent it through him.

63
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:22,394
This evening there is public meeting.
I didn't tell you because...

64
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,830
No... No...
Baba... Baba...

65
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:34,800
Son...
I am here... Sit...

66
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,516
Lightning...
- Where?

67
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:43,276
The banyan tree... Here...
in front of me...

68
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:48,878
What are you saying these days...?
Have you turned into a saint?

69
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:53,839
Get ready... Get ready...

70
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:57,719
Okay. I will get ready.

71
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:02,675
I will get ready wearing my
birthday clothes. I will be ready.

72
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:10,400
The truth is I don't
like these felicitations...

73
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,772
I wish the old days
would come back...

74
00:09:15,773 --> 00:09:18,195
You four brothers...

75
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:23,714
Lovingly I call out to you.
Atul, Batul, Shamla, Shatul...

76
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:29,917
One is good, one is naughty,
one is quiet and one is smart.

77
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,997
I would return from the office
and would see... A bustling household...

78
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:42,960
And today the same house
is empty... Only three people...

79
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,036
The father is there but not quite.

80
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:51,320
Your mother wasn't...

81
00:09:51,326 --> 00:09:55,797
even fifty and went away.

82
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,710
The only consolation...
she did not suffer.

83
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,199
One by one,
all three sons went their way...

84
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:13,437
When I sit alone,
I feel miserable...

85
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:19,714
The days that were...
and what's left now...

86
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:23,839
The past is gone... Won't come back...
Be happy with what you have.

87
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,568
That's why I am here Proshanto.

88
00:10:33,569 --> 00:10:36,630
And I console myself...

89
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:44,100
I am lucky that my
three sons are doing well...

90
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:49,396
They took the family name
to the heights.

91
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,717
You know the reason for it?

92
00:10:55,080 --> 00:11:01,080
I used to believe in two
very old proverbs.

93
00:11:01,081 --> 00:11:02,998
Even now...

94
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:10,916
Work is worship.
Honesty is the best policy.

95
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,548
Oh... You remember that?

96
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,950
Work is worship.
Honesty is best policy...

97
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,633
I'm sorry Baba...

98
00:11:29,634 --> 00:11:32,838
My head... I...

99
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:41,439
I am talking to you after so many
days... Will you not listen to me?

100
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,094
Please forgive me, Baba...

101
00:11:46,095 --> 00:11:50,275
You talk... Very sorry... Talk...

102
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:57,077
My opinion and belief... The the way
the three sons were brought up...

103
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:01,996
They definitely believed in these proverbs.

104
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:06,911
And that is the reason for their success.

105
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,788
Everybody says these
are times of corruption...

106
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:17,077
I hear so many awful things...

107
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,552
You don't hear them. Money
is of two types. Do you know?

108
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:26,550
Two... Two...
There are two kinds of money...

109
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:30,910
Yes, one is white which is accountable.

110
00:12:30,911 --> 00:12:33,996
One black. Not accountable.

111
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,071
Honest money and dishonest money...

112
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:41,431
Anyway...
Money can be any type.

113
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,718
I will never believe...

114
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,835
Even if one wants to stay straight;
one cannot. And being straight...

115
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:53,038
Zero... Zero... Zero...

116
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,669
What's happening Proshanto?

117
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,757
Stop it, Proshanto!

118
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:31,643
I hurt you...

119
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:37,645
Please forgive me Proshanto.

120
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:45,920
Injustice...
Injustice... Injustice...

121
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,714
I have lost my head...

122
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:08,700
Sir... Sir...

123
00:14:08,718 --> 00:14:14,718
Nirupama Trust has sent three
gentlemen with bouquets...

124
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,913
Listen, I want to tell you one thing
Proshanto, because you're with me...

125
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:35,040
At least I can see
one of my son's faces.

126
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,956
Do you think it's a small thing?

127
00:14:39,957 --> 00:14:43,989
If you weren't here, how alone I'd be.

128
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:49,868
They come. Enquire. Take care of me.

129
00:14:49,869 --> 00:14:53,437
Love me... All this is fine.

130
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,958
But they cannot take my son's place.

131
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:00,694
You are not working...

132
00:15:00,695 --> 00:15:05,274
but you are my son... my blood...

133
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,676
You understand?

134
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,554
As long as you are with me,

135
00:15:13,555 --> 00:15:17,279
I'm at peace. Always remember this.

136
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:31,080
We can never pay
back our debt to him.

137
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:37,680
What we can do is let him know
our gratefulness toward him.

138
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:42,915
To execute this duty,

139
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:47,742
on his seventieth birthday,

140
00:15:47,743 --> 00:15:50,960
a memorable day...

141
00:15:50,995 --> 00:15:55,082
We, residents of this town

142
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:58,855
that is named after him,

143
00:15:58,856 --> 00:16:02,155
raised this function.

144
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:08,750
This great man,
who has done so much for us...

145
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:13,684
We have his blessings

146
00:16:13,685 --> 00:16:19,632
and for that we thank God.

147
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,874
Today we wish this great man

148
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:30,875
a heathy, eventful and active long life.

149
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:46,167
Everybody knows the
great literary maestro

150
00:16:46,168 --> 00:16:48,439
Mr. Jaidev Mukhopadhyay.

151
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:53,190
He has written
Mr. Anando Mohar's biography.

152
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:57,377
First he will read out passages

153
00:16:57,378 --> 00:17:01,870
from the book and then present it.

154
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:17,237
Respected Mr. Anando Mohan Majumdar...

155
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:23,112
Friends and companions...

156
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,950
I cannot tell how successful
I have been in my work.

157
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:32,949
To document this great man from

158
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:37,317
childhood to his ideals and aims...

159
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:41,501
To this township, which is a

160
00:17:41,502 --> 00:17:45,638
strange and unbelievable story

161
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:51,956
has not been an easy job.
I don't know how successful I have been.

162
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:57,360
The readers wil be the best judge.
But I can say one thing...

163
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:02,469
Without Mr. Anando Mohar's help,
this would not have been possible.

164
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:05,791
I am eternally...
- Are you feeling uncomfortable?

165
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:09,358
I now wish to present

166
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:12,991
my small gift to him...

167
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:27,888
I request this great man

168
00:18:27,889 --> 00:18:31,955
to say a few words...

169
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,596
Probir...
This is Dada.

170
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:01,277
What happened?
Baba... Heart attack.

171
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:05,109
You mean he is dead?
- No no he has survived.

172
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:09,766
He is at home. The
specialist is with him.

173
00:19:09,767 --> 00:19:12,351
And our Dr. Shom is there.

174
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:18,876
He is not serious...
But, you can understand at this age.

175
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:22,311
When did it happen?
- It happened this evening.

176
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:26,593
Jagdish Babu has been
trying to call since then.

177
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:31,032
Does Pratap know?
- Pratap's phone is not working.

178
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:34,140
He isn't far from you.

179
00:19:34,141 --> 00:19:40,035
If you could send a small
note with Bansilal...

180
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:45,757
I'll do that. But... we have to go...
- Of course...

181
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:51,512
Must... We must. We must go.
Tomorrow morning.

182
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:55,836
I have to go to the office.

183
00:19:55,837 --> 00:20:01,276
You come here by 10.30 with Pratap.

184
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:05,599
Uma will go. You,
Tapti, Dingu and Protap.

185
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:10,794
Six people and two cars.
No problem.

186
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:13,912
But...
- You want to know for how many days?

187
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,877
That we cannot say right now.

188
00:20:17,878 --> 00:20:20,951
Be prepared for seven days.

189
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,271
Okay?

190
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,919
How is he doing?

191
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:18,715
Both the doctors are here
and waiting for you.

192
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,469
He is Dr. Sahay.
Cardiologist.

193
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,831
I have heard a lot about you.

194
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,593
He's from Ranchi. Luckily he was
here for a case and we informed him.

195
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:36,996
Everything was arranged so quickly.

196
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:42,672
We decided to keep him at home.
- You will not believe it.

197
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:48,153
Medicine, oxygen, day
night nurse... Everyhing is arranged.

198
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,512
How do you find him?

199
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:55,639
We cannot say anything
for the next 72 hours.

200
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,076
But, we are doing our best.

201
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,989
Can we...
- He is under sedation...

202
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,988
You can see him tomorrow morning.
Okay?

203
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,590
He is my assistant, Amar Dey.
He is staying here.

204
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,711
If needed, he will help out.

205
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:20,238
Arrangements for your stay...
- Your Manager has put us in that room.

206
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,477
Can I take your leave?
- Are you going now?

207
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,797
I shall go now.
I will see you tomorrow.

208
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:31,349
Your father is highly respected.

209
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:59,992
Last night the telephone
was horrible. Unexpected...

210
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,435
I was there.
- Were you there?

211
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,029
At the reception?
- It happened in front of me.

212
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,629
That's why everything
could be arranged so quickly.

213
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:12,158
But, Dr. Sahay to be here...
It's just unbelievable...

214
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:17,070
Yes, in a small place...
Else it would be very difficult.

215
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,959
Otherwise... there isn't
another Cardiologist like him here.

216
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:25,359
We are very, very lucky.
- But he still has regular check-ups...

217
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:28,480
Yes. There is no complaint.

218
00:23:28,481 --> 00:23:32,591
Pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar...

219
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:38,670
Everything normal.
- Surprising. One can never tell...

220
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,236
Rest. You must be very tired.
I will be in that room.

221
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:58,560
Uma, please ask Laxman
to make some tea.

222
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,071
You sit Didi, I'll go.

223
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:05,632
Please keep quiet and
do not speak loudly.

224
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,872
Will you have a cup of tea?

225
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:13,101
I do not mind. Pratab?

226
00:24:13,802 --> 00:24:15,839
Yes, please.

227
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,919
Mezda will you have tea?

228
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,719
Will you have tea, Mezda?

229
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,905
Are you all okay?

230
00:24:32,906 --> 00:24:37,994
Softly, Mezda. Baba is sleeping.

231
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:44,800
Sleep. Sleep. Sleep.

232
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,192
Knits up the ravelled sleeve of care.

233
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,310
Baba,
why is the man doing this?

234
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:06,994
He is your Mejo Jetu.
Have you forgotten? He is not well.

235
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,397
Proshanto,
did you go to the reception?

236
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,127
No... No...

237
00:25:14,128 --> 00:25:20,128
I knew... I knew...

238
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,953
What do you know?

239
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:28,280
I know. I know...

240
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,998
Did you know,
Baba would suffer like this?

241
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,430
I know.

242
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,479
Will all of you have a bath?
Should I ask for hot water?

243
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:44,431
Yes please. So dusty...
- Ditto. For everyone...

244
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,357
Won't any of you meet him?
- Who?

245
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:54,108
Thakurda?
- I refuse to go...

246
00:25:55,720 --> 00:26:01,158
I cannot handle senility.
- He won't recognize us. No use.

247
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,396
Then I will go and see him...

248
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:23,234
Greetings Ma'am.
- How is he?

249
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,879
Better. Watch.

250
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:31,876
Please raise your hand, Khuda Babu.

251
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,638
Please raise your hand...

252
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,270
Don't you want
to wear your pullover?

253
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,118
Raise your hand...

254
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:46,357
Very good...
Very good...

255
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:51,754
Good... Good...

256
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,597
Let's wear it.

257
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:59,151
Put your arm in...
Good boy...

258
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,671
Good boy. Good boy.
Very good boy...

259
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:56,160
I am your grand daughter-in-law...
Grand daughter-in-law...

260
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,352
Understood?

261
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:08,032
I'll take your leave now.
I'll come tomorrow. May I go?

262
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:20,436
Grand daughter-in-law...

263
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:27,149
How is he?
- Like the last time.

264
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,757
Come let's go Dingu.

265
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:40,074
What an useless existence...

266
00:28:40,075 --> 00:28:45,359
He is now 93... Isn't it so, Proshanto?

267
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,359
Hasn't grandfather turned 93?

268
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:53,168
You all are working people.

269
00:28:53,169 --> 00:28:56,240
Work... Work is...

270
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,233
Tea is ready.
Please come here everyone...

271
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,675
How is your Hi fi doing?

272
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:09,274
Hi... Fine, very fine...

273
00:29:09,275 --> 00:29:12,150
Come Probir...

274
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,155
Enough.
Stop licking... Get up.

275
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:48,999
Today is the first day.
Please don't expect too much.

276
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,232
Laxman...
- As long as there's chicken...

277
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,318
Will you have some roti?

278
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:04,118
Thakurpo... Rice or Roti?

279
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,033
Rice?

280
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:14,194
Baba, when will we go back?
- When Grandpa gets better.

281
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,959
Enough...

282
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,634
Please have...
- No. I am not hungry.

283
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,990
You too come and eat.

284
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:51,373
Surprising. His health was perfect...

285
00:30:51,374 --> 00:30:53,952
Regular habits...

286
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:58,746
He never drank or smoked.

287
00:30:58,747 --> 00:31:04,318
You forget. He worked hard until 60.

288
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:08,035
Should I tell you something?
- Me?

289
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,071
Stop smoking.

290
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:14,199
You think I've never told him this?
Three years of the same thing...

291
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:18,877
What is the use of giving
up the thing I enjoy most!

292
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,953
Smoking reduces a lifespan...
Do you know that?

293
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:27,951
How long did Dada live?

294
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,280
Till the age of 80.
80 for sure, if not more.

295
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,470
Till the last day he
was drinking and smoking...

296
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,072
Should I serve you some vegetables,
Mezda?

297
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:57,200
What did you tell your office?
- Father's ill health...

298
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:01,030
Did you say how many days?
- How could I tell?

299
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:06,559
I too couldn't. Let's see
what Dr. Sahay has to say tomorrow.

300
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,192
Protap has finished eating.

301
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:21,037
What's wrong? We travelled 200 miles.
You didn't speak a word.

302
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:26,231
We are all worried about Baba.
But not like you.

303
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,677
Baba will be fine.

304
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:34,671
What did you say?
- Baba will be fine.

305
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:41,880
As if you know
everything from before.

306
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,552
Baba will be alright.

307
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:49,110
Bless you for saying so.

308
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:27,872
I was hoping there would
be some improvement this time.

309
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,981
It is not a curable illness.

310
00:33:30,982 --> 00:33:34,918
But this time he at least ate with us.

311
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:39,035
It would have been better to
put him in an institution.

312
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:44,314
Why? He is not troubling anyone.
And he isn't an insane person.

313
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:47,535
But still bad enough.

314
00:33:47,536 --> 00:33:52,155
Is this any time to listen to music?

315
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:08,040
Here Baba is ill and
look at his concern...

316
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,875
You forget that he is ill.

317
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,239
It's wrong to expect normal
behavior from him.

318
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,159
Only he knows
what rubbish he plays.

319
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,516
It is Bach.
- What?

320
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:23,792
Johann Sebastian Bach.
Have you not heard of him?

321
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:29,115
I've not only heard his name.

322
00:34:29,116 --> 00:34:33,355
I even know he fathered a lot of kids.

323
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,795
Very good!
Where did you get that from?

324
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:40,318
Readers Digest, Madam!

325
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:48,714
They are never wrong, you know!
How come you said Bach?

326
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,672
Dada came back from abroad with
this passion. Heard a lot of it.

327
00:34:55,120 --> 00:35:00,717
From 15 till I got married,
I heard only this music.

328
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:04,314
Did you like it?
- Very much...

329
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,839
Who's that?

330
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:16,870
Did you get the flask?
- No. But it doesn't make a difference.

331
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:20,115
I don't get thirsty in the
middle of a winter night.

332
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:26,710
Do you sleep well these days?
- No.

333
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,159
Tell me what is happening to you...

334
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,030
You don't hide anything from me...

335
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:38,669
Tell me... Please?
- There's nothing wrong with me. Leave me.

336
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,436
And switch off the
light as you go out.

337
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,793
Who are you?
- My name is Amar Dey.

338
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,518
He's my assistant.
He's staying here.

339
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:25,117
Here means?
- In the next room.

340
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,830
On your bed.
It's more comfortable than mine.

341
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:43,630
Can we see him?
- Your family has come to see you.

342
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:47,916
You can come and meet him.
One by one.

343
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:03,517
I can't bear to see you lying in bed.

344
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,516
I didn't think you would
have to bear this.

345
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:19,230
Are you fine?
- Yes Baba, we are all fine.

346
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:24,069
Now I'll go...
The others are waiting to meet you.

347
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,073
Proshanto...
Will you go...

348
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,473
Don't you want to meet Baba?

349
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,754
Probir...
You go in...

350
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:00,110
Get well soon, Baba.

351
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,278
Shall I go...

352
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:08,559
There's a long queue outside.

353
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:15,033
Protap... Your turn...

354
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,072
Bodi, you go in...

355
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,839
Okay. I will go.

356
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:34,476
We all are here Baba.
All of us want you to get well soon.

357
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:41,600
It feels so good to see you smiling.
Don't remain in bed for too long.

358
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:48,000
I can't bear to see you like this.
Get well soon.

359
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:55,557
Hey... Come...

360
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,672
Is this a new bed?

361
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,829
Yes...

362
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,996
When you get better,
we'll go to Mungadi.

363
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:07,432
Definitely.
Enough Dingu... Come here...

364
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:09,949
I'm going Dadu.
Okay...

365
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,719
I'm going Dadu.

366
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:21,073
I must go too... Until the evening.
- Thank you doctor.

367
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:27,833
Dr. Sahay... I was...

368
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,799
Ramdahin... Ramdahin...

369
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:04,878
Why did you let him out?

370
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,351
I went out for one minute,
sir...

371
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:17,477
Oh my old man... Come on...
Back to your room...

372
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,998
Sorry.
He is... your...

373
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:31,191
Grandfather. 93...

374
00:40:31,192 --> 00:40:35,634
Four generations...
Difficult to believe!

375
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:40,027
You know the case very well.

376
00:40:40,028 --> 00:40:42,999
Can you tell how long...

377
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,913
How long you have to stay.
- Exactly...

378
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:50,108
You see, my brothers and I
have to go back to work...

379
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:54,048
Mr. Majumdar, to be quite honest.

380
00:40:54,049 --> 00:40:57,917
Only after 3 weeks will we know for

381
00:40:57,918 --> 00:41:01,675
sure the patient is out of danger.

382
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:06,795
Three weeks?
- Three weeks.

383
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:11,180
Dr. Sahay, I have a suggestion...

384
00:41:11,181 --> 00:41:14,272
My younger brother, Probir.

385
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,238
Hello...
Yes, tell me...

386
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:23,600
The distance isn't much...

387
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:28,715
If we go back in a week...

388
00:41:28,716 --> 00:41:32,231
We can return if needed...

389
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,792
He is your father. I can't decide.

390
00:41:37,793 --> 00:41:43,148
I can give you my opinion as a doctor.

391
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:47,194
This is the general rule
for cases like this.

392
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:51,070
What you want to do
is up to you.

393
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:56,266
For one week, it is difficult

394
00:41:56,267 --> 00:42:00,030
to give any assurances.

395
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:04,549
It's just a five hour journey. We
can be called by phone.

396
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,219
Was this your suggestion?

397
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:13,439
As a matter of fact, yes.

398
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:25,137
Very well. As you deem fit.

399
00:42:25,138 --> 00:42:29,037
Let's hope for the best. Good bye.

400
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:31,754
Thank you doctor,
thank you so much.

401
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:35,956
What is it?
- A reporter from The Statesman.

402
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,589
Wants to meet you.
- Come on.

403
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:44,072
Please have a seat.

404
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:54,636
What can I do for you?
I'm a reporter from The Statesman.

405
00:42:54,920 --> 00:43:00,920
Bijon Sarkar. We got to know of
your father's illness from the PTI.

406
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:04,308
My editor called me about it.

407
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:10,357
Not much is known
about him in West Bengal.

408
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:15,153
He asked me to collect
facts to write a story.

409
00:43:15,154 --> 00:43:17,314
I reached here yesterday.

410
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:20,912
If you can...
- Sure. Go ahead.

411
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:23,351
Just a minute...

412
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:32,748
Can I tell you something about him first?
See if that's right.

413
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,479
Please go ahead.

414
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:42,421
The name of the place was Salgiri.

415
00:43:42,422 --> 00:43:46,596
Later it was known by Anandnagar.

416
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:52,392
In the year 1980, on his 60th birthday,
without his permission...

417
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:57,675
some VIP's took this decision.

418
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:02,869
And this was announced in
a public meeting in his honour.

419
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:06,073
Your father was born in Hazaribaug...
That's right.

420
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:10,114
Yes, My grandfather was teaching
English in St. Columbo school.

421
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:13,198
Your grandfather's name?
Abhoy Charan Majumdar.

422
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:20,072
Your father did his Matriculation
from there and came to Calcutta...

423
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:21,838
Yes.
City College.

424
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:27,960
After his BA, he joined
Orient Mica Works very soon.

425
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:33,476
Yes, with the recommendation of a friend,
he joined as an apprentice.

426
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:35,477
At the age of nineteen.

427
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:41,036
Now I want to know about
your father's progress.

428
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:47,560
Very simple! Overseer, Manager...

429
00:44:47,652 --> 00:44:53,153
General Manager... Partner.

430
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:57,628
Oh Great... Hop, skip and jump!

431
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:02,391
Actually, Baba was noticed by
the top guys from the start.

432
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:08,640
He was very intelligent
and extremely hard working.

433
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:13,639
To some extent, he was responsible
for the expansion of Mica Works.

434
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:19,880
Almost for everything.
It was during his General Manager days.

435
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:23,275
Increase in output,

436
00:45:23,276 --> 00:45:26,953
export, mine expansion...

437
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,675
New manufacturing units,

438
00:45:29,676 --> 00:45:33,594
upliftment of workers. All due to him.

439
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:39,992
He is also known and famous
for his humanitarian deeds.

440
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:46,159
Yes, schools, children's parks,

441
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:51,438
hospitals, etc.

442
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:57,680
Workers to date
treat him like God.

443
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:06,156
He started a small trust in memory
of my mother. Nirupama Trust.

444
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:10,279
A regular charitable organization.

445
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:15,570
Your father has numerous qualities.

446
00:46:15,571 --> 00:46:19,033
Which is the most striking?

447
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:25,277
Yes, without doubt...
his honesty...

448
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,749
Can you give an
example of such a case?

449
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:32,619
As an export firm, bribes

450
00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:37,119
are normal to get orders.

451
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:43,520
But Baba never
offered a single penny.

452
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:47,444
He used to say, the quality of our

453
00:46:47,445 --> 00:46:51,155
Mica will automatically get orders.

454
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:55,552
It used to happen.
- You are four brothers, right?

455
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:58,035
And sister?
- None.

456
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:03,270
Your mother?
- Passed away in 1973.

457
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:06,553
Thank you.
This is enough.

458
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:13,142
Very good. If you want more details,

459
00:47:13,143 --> 00:47:16,830
there is his biography by...

460
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:22,558
Jaidev Mukhopadhya
- Thank you.

461
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:29,231
Are you leaving?
- I'll just drop in at Col. Chaterjee's.

462
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:46,905
Listen... I am making coffee for Dada.

463
00:47:46,906 --> 00:47:49,632
If you want some, come up.

464
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:55,042
Hello... Sanyal?

465
00:47:55,043 --> 00:47:59,996
This is Majumdar from Ananadnagar...

466
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:05,718
I need to stay here for
a week or so longer...

467
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:11,791
Please manage everything. And listen,
don't forget Chimanlal's work.

468
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:16,670
That's very important.
In case you need to call...

469
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:22,319
The number here is 214... 214...

470
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:26,205
I'll hang up now. And listen,

471
00:48:26,206 --> 00:48:31,554
if you have to call,
this is the right time.

472
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:55,708
I saw Sezda going out.

473
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:59,953
He is a very restless person...
How long could he sit at home...

474
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:19,994
I won't go without knowing
what has happened to you.

475
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:26,556
I didn't expect this from you and
I cannot tolerate this behavior.

476
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,313
You must tell me.

477
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:34,353
I left my job.

478
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:38,159
What?
- You heard me.

479
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:43,675
Have you gone mad? You left a ten
year tenure? Such a good salary...

480
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:50,918
When did this happen?

481
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:58,040
December 6, 1989.

482
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:05,478
A month has passed and
you didn't tell me...

483
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:10,279
Sorry Bodi.
I did not want to worry you.

484
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:14,712
What was the reason? Please tell me.
I can't believe this!

485
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:18,782
Yes, I'll tell you everything.

486
00:50:18,783 --> 00:50:23,595
Why I took up the job; why I left it.

487
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,236
I'll tell you everything.

488
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:36,412
Baba wanted me to work with a good firm.

489
00:50:36,413 --> 00:50:39,795
I didn't disappoint Baba.

490
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:45,396
The reason for taking
up the job... was Baba.

491
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:54,479
Good work. Good salary.
Everything was fine.

492
00:50:57,080 --> 00:51:01,119
But in the past 10 years
I noticed something wrong.

493
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:07,023
I started wondering what

494
00:51:07,024 --> 00:51:11,835
was right and what was wrong.

495
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:19,117
I was doing something
that was hurting my conscience.

496
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:26,317
And in simple words...
I was not happy.

497
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:32,513
In the meantime if I see a person...

498
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:35,669
A person I know very closely...

499
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:40,956
And know him as an honest man...
Who, with one of his colleagues,

500
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:46,396
commits a heinous crime
by taking huge bribes.

501
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:51,430
Of lacs of rupees from a client.

502
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:54,932
It is impossible to work in

503
00:51:54,933 --> 00:51:58,837
the same office with such a person.

504
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:05,518
Is he Romenda?
- He is more than my brother...

505
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:11,676
And gave me the job...
- How did you know this?

506
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:16,303
The news leaks. I hear...

507
00:52:16,304 --> 00:52:19,634
And I run to him...

508
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:21,653
Romenda...

509
00:52:21,654 --> 00:52:25,717
No, no not 15... No...

510
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:33,400
Not 15... 18 would be okay.
18...

511
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:38,079
What time? Monday...

512
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:43,229
At my office... Around 4.30?

513
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:50,279
What is it?
- Romenda...

514
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:58,198
Please tell me just once
that you are doing this...

515
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:00,669
Doing what? Come sit.

516
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:05,278
Try to understand. Just once.
I laughed it off.

517
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:09,599
Even in death I cannot
believe this is true?

518
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:16,200
If you don't believe, don't.
Why are you getting so upset. Sit.

519
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:25,951
He casually told me the client's name...

520
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:33,670
The amount...
Where... When...

521
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:38,594
The people involved... I just...

522
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:47,515
Did you see the watch?

523
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:51,634
Rolex. Gold.
Brand new.

524
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:57,312
Yes...
- Do you know the price?

525
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,834
My head is spinning,
Romenda.

526
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:10,438
Why is it happening?

527
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:15,400
Why can't I recognise
you in this mask?

528
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:20,912
Why have you turned
into a different person.

529
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:23,435
Do you know why?

530
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:32,776
After being in this line for 10 years,

531
00:54:32,777 --> 00:54:36,716
you've remained an innocent babe.

532
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,755
So it's true...
You and Alokda...

533
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:46,076
Yes. True.

534
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:50,353
But Romen Datta will have
a single scratch on him.

535
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:57,196
Are you blind?
The times have changed.

536
00:54:57,360 --> 00:55:03,360
Your father's principles
do not work in today's world.

537
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:08,682
Whatever we are doing,

538
00:55:08,683 --> 00:55:12,756
is the law and rule.

539
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:16,714
If you can't stand it, leave.
You have no future here. Get out.

540
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:21,391
How terrible...

541
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,630
I've met him a few times.
I'd liked him.

542
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:33,636
You will like him now too.

543
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:39,198
You won't see it from the outside;
but inside... Cancer. Corruption.

544
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:42,110
Did you resign after this?

545
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,878
The very next day...

546
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:52,355
On the other hand I was proud
of standing against corruption.

547
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:57,996
But to lose such a good job?

548
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:01,072
Now what are you going to do?

549
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:06,592
I want to publish a magazine
that I'd mentioned to you.

550
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:12,470
The one in which you were
to write very boldly?

551
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:19,080
Yes, one wealthy person
is going to back me up...

552
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:23,799
What happened?

553
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,676
What happened?

554
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:37,077
What shall I write Bodi?

555
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:40,836
Whatever has happened in China.

556
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:46,558
Poland. Hungary. Romania.
Germany. Czechoslovakia.

557
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:50,351
I feel so confused.

558
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:55,956
Whom should I believe?
I myself do not know...

559
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:03,639
But you need a job to run the house...
Don't you need another job?

560
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:15,720
Have you heard of Kiran Kumar?
- Kiran Kumar?

561
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:20,748
There are two ads in the newspaper.
Obviously, you haven't read it.

562
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:27,560
New artiste Kiran Kumar
in the title role.

563
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:32,512
Did you join a "Jatra"?

564
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:39,434
No... Theater...
Professional theater.

565
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:45,277
It is a thousand times
better than the agency.

566
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:51,958
The theater owner, Santosh Pramanik
saw me in the office play.

567
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:59,280
You know when? 1983.
Even you've seen me then.

568
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:06,039
Gentleman had offered you work.

569
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:10,149
You have chosen wrong line.

570
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:15,714
I'd told him it was
impossible to leave my job.

571
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:20,189
He'd said, my doors are open for you.

572
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:23,758
When I went to him this time;
he was ecstatic.

573
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:30,951
But I want to tell you this, Bodi.
I didn't take this on thoughtlessly.

574
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:37,552
I really love acting.
- And you are really good at it.

575
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:39,639
Then why are you surprised?

576
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:46,877
I'm thinking of you. Of your family.
Anando Mujamdar's son...

577
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:52,950
Wearing make up and walking the stage...
Isn't it a little difficult?

578
00:58:55,280 --> 00:59:00,612
The new play will open
two Saturdays from now.

579
00:59:00,613 --> 00:59:02,994
The rehearsals are on.

580
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:09,834
Does theater have no politics?
- Tell me where it isn't.

581
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:13,273
But comparatively less in theater.
That I know.

582
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:15,074
Salary?

583
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:16,992
Okay for a bachelor.

584
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:24,513
But how long will you be unmarried?
For a man 34 is not too old.

585
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:30,833
Its painful for me to think there
is no one to care for you.

586
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:35,512
Bodi, I forgot to tell you one more thing...
Don't be angry.

587
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:38,997
What?

588
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:42,511
I met a girl.

589
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:51,560
Wonderful.
Who is she?

590
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:59,480
She's a researcher. Doing a
random survey before Elections.

591
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:04,872
She came for some
opinions related to that.

592
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:09,599
Met her then.
- What's her name?

593
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:14,192
Nandita.
Nandita Sen.

594
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:17,631
How old is she?
- 28.

595
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:24,749
Appearance doesn't matter to me;
but I'm still asking.

596
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:30,518
Is she good looking?

597
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:35,838
Intelligent?

598
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:43,108
A soulmate?

599
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:51,235
Then why the delay?

600
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:58,518
I told her, if I get fame in theater,
my income may increase.

601
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:01,593
Whatever has to happen will happen then.

602
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:04,079
Not before that.

603
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:20,390
What are you looking at?
- You.

604
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:24,862
With a new vision.

605
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:30,031
You don't know how happy I am.

606
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:40,554
I hope your wife
will be your friend...

607
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:47,280
If the wife is a friend;
does Bodi stop being one?

608
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:53,295
You will have your family...

609
01:01:53,296 --> 01:01:57,669
That's my biggest happiness.

610
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:06,479
My husband will never be a friend.
That's a fact.

611
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:13,080
But still,
I see a change in him.

612
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:19,633
For the better.
But he still goes to the races.

613
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:24,831
But he comes home
early and even drinks less.

614
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:30,305
The one thing I loved,

615
01:02:30,306 --> 01:02:36,233
his full bodied
laughter... Is coming back.

616
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:41,109
I don't know what the reason is.

617
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:48,800
But my uneasiness has eased a lot.

618
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:59,950
Once you are married. You will be away...
It's a fact. But that's natural.

619
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:06,840
I have no scarcity of occupation.

620
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:14,154
My biggest job is
bringing up my son.

621
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:19,478
I know that will reduce a lot
of the emptiness in my heart.

622
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:26,198
And without the luxury of friendship...

623
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:30,309
I will live the rest of my life.

624
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:42,918
Will you not take some Ghee,
brother.

625
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:48,517
What is the day today?
I forgot it's the 10th today.

626
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:50,279
Wednesday.

627
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:55,273
Calcutta is having races.
- Winter season.

628
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:59,792
You could not go this Saturday?

629
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:02,558
Why are you laughing?

630
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:06,427
Calcutta, Mumbai, Bangalore,

631
01:04:06,428 --> 01:04:10,389
Madras. Wherever a race is on...

632
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:14,150
Wherever you are;
you can bet.

633
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:15,508
What do you mean?

634
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:19,997
If you are in a village it won't
happen. You need a telephone.

635
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:24,553
Whom will you call.
- My bookie.

636
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:28,390
Bookie?
- Bookmaker...

637
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:31,837
Who plays for us...

638
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:35,950
On credit?
- Naturally!

639
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:56,139
The long distance business...

640
01:04:56,140 --> 01:05:00,794
Can you depend on these bookies?

641
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:05,789
Generally it's okay.
But sometimes it goes bad.

642
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:08,635
You have to take that risk.

643
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:10,793
What do you mean by risk?

644
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:14,551
You talk as if you
are going to play races...

645
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:17,030
I'll go for races.

646
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:20,077
Dingo babu is going for races.

647
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:22,789
Dingo go to your room.

648
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:27,519
Dingo go to your room. You are a good boy.

649
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:34,589
I am going.

650
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:42,552
What problems? We don't know.
- What is there to know?

651
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:46,475
Wait, it's interesting.

652
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:54,160
Suppose you called your
bookie and told him...

653
01:05:56,440 --> 01:06:00,319
To play a particular
horse for one lac.

654
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:07,473
Bookie did not listen to you...

655
01:06:07,474 --> 01:06:11,550
he gave the jockey 25 grand.

656
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:14,351
Your horse lost the race,
the bookie took 75 grand...

657
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:21,112
And you are left sucking your thumb.

658
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:28,071
Hear that? Still you will
say I want to play the races?

659
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:34,228
But I am convinced by one thing;

660
01:06:34,229 --> 01:06:37,591
gambling cannot make you rich.

661
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:41,918
There is no use
talking about all this, Dada.

662
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:46,351
Gambling is an age old practice of man.

663
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:48,916
Some are lucky; some are not.

664
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:55,398
Don't talk about Dharmraj.
- Never... I won't forget his state.

665
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:59,231
That is not my state,
as you can see.

666
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:03,990
But you have to agree
that it is a vice.

667
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:06,371
One hundred times.

668
01:07:06,372 --> 01:07:11,271
But the fact is I don't
hide it from anyone.

669
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:15,799
A whole world knows that
Prabir Mujamdar goes to the races.

670
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:24,269
But the race is not your actual income.
You have a business.

671
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:28,434
I hope you won't call that a vice too!

672
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:30,478
That depends.

673
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:37,635
Listen Dada...

674
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:44,600
Speculation doesn't
happen only in business.

675
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:49,032
Every level,
every profession has this...

676
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:54,390
Nobody can survive without
number two money. Impossible.

677
01:07:54,720 --> 01:08:00,720
Honesty does not pay.
You will perish.

678
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:07,038
You are General Manager of a company.
I'm a businessman.

679
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:11,559
There is no difference between us.

680
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:17,275
Both of us are looking
for dishonest money

681
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:23,760
What do you know about me?
We hardly meet twice or trice a year.

682
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:28,869
You want me to tell you
what I know about you?

683
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:34,188
Yes. Tell me.
- You are asking for it.

684
01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:36,716
I am telling you to,
so go ahead.

685
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:44,865
Tax.

686
01:08:44,868 --> 01:08:49,277
Whatever you get over
and above your salary...

687
01:08:50,240 --> 01:08:54,597
Are called perks.
I don't count that.

688
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:59,070
That amount doesn't fall
under the income tax slab.

689
01:09:01,280 --> 01:09:07,280
But whatever is your declared salary,

690
01:09:07,340 --> 01:09:09,631
it is taxable.

691
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:14,877
On which you have to pay tax

692
01:09:14,878 --> 01:09:19,033
which must be 10 to 12 thousand.

693
01:09:19,680 --> 01:09:22,035
Am I right?

694
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:25,835
Carry on.

695
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:29,957
Still, I know and a lot of
other people also know that...

696
01:09:31,160 --> 01:09:35,153
Apart from the company flat,
you have two houses...

697
01:09:36,280 --> 01:09:40,239
Apart from the company car;
you have two more. Both air conditioned.

698
01:09:41,360 --> 01:09:44,318
You have two colour TVs, both Japanese.

699
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:49,506
At your occasional party,

700
01:09:49,507 --> 01:09:53,991
you serve nothing but scotch.

701
01:09:55,440 --> 01:10:01,072
You had your daughter's wedding
reception in Fort Williams.

702
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:04,757
You invited 1500 people.

703
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:11,591
Swear and say, is it possible
without dishonest money?

704
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:14,511
The wealth you saved from income tax...

705
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:27,395
Proshanto...

706
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:38,509
Prashanto,
Prashanto, Prashanto...

707
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:53,352
Protap, do something.
Please do something...

708
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:03,597
Please Mezda calm down,
please calm down.

709
01:11:03,720 --> 01:11:06,393
Please Mezda...

710
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:09,875
Calm down...
Please Mezda...

711
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:26,155
Leave him...
I'll take care of him...

712
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:43,835
Did you see Proshanto's condition?

713
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:48,432
There is no place for him
except the mental asylum.

714
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:52,356
Will you not call this madness?

715
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:12,032
What is this?
Are you crying?

716
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:29,310
Listen, don't be childish.
Try and understand.

717
01:13:29,800 --> 01:13:34,874
There is nothing wrong in
whatever Probir said. It isn't wrong...

718
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:40,513
You heard about the tax.
Half the salary goes toward tax.

719
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:45,317
The way inflation is going up...
You don't have to tell...

720
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:47,755
You can understand
by the way we spend.

721
01:13:47,960 --> 01:13:52,272
5 years ago,
Hilsa was 25 rupees a kilo.

722
01:13:52,520 --> 01:13:55,318
Today it is touching a hundred rupees.

723
01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:03,871
Without the extra income,
we could not have lived in this style.

724
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:06,835
You have also been
brought up the same way.

725
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:13,310
No one thinks about it anymore.
It's become a way of life.

726
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:17,637
Have you forgotten
whose son you are?

727
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:22,032
I don't know what Baba will say...

728
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:27,798
I consider myself successful.

729
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:36,151
What Probir said about me...

730
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:42,190
Could I not have given him a reply?

731
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:45,314
Of all the bad vices he indulges in;
do I do that?

732
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:54,191
I invite people and offer scotch.
But I don't drink as much.

733
01:14:56,520 --> 01:14:59,353
I don't smoke and I don't gamble.

734
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:09,276
Have you heard a single
scandal about me to date?

735
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:16,396
I know only two places.
Office and home...

736
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:20,469
I sleep at 10 at night
and wake up at 5 in the morning.

737
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:23,832
Still you don't know
what your husband is?

738
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:28,957
Why can't we have a limited income?

739
01:15:28,958 --> 01:15:34,751
I too know about that money,
but can't we live without it?

740
01:15:36,280 --> 01:15:38,497
It is nothing, Uma.

741
01:15:38,498 --> 01:15:43,516
Nobody will talk ill
about Probodh Majumdar.

742
01:15:44,120 --> 01:15:49,148
But if there's one
car instead of three...

743
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:55,560
Or Indian alcohol instead of scotch...
Then people will talk...

744
01:16:02,920 --> 01:16:07,869
You mean there is
nothing called honesty?

745
01:16:08,160 --> 01:16:12,358
The way Baba had in his days?
Those days are gone.

746
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:18,718
You will feel bad to hear this.
It may trouble you.

747
01:16:20,040 --> 01:16:22,793
But trust me.

748
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:32,119
You are forgetting one thing, Uma.

749
01:16:33,560 --> 01:16:37,678
Did your husband ever give
you one moment of pain?

750
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:41,119
Tell me, please tell me...

751
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:44,756
Tell me...

752
01:16:57,400 --> 01:17:00,915
What are you looking at?
- You...

753
01:17:02,040 --> 01:17:04,713
Mrs. Probir Majumdar.

754
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:12,592
After the honeymoon, I never got a
chance to see you this closely.

755
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:15,715
Are you tired of that?

756
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:17,877
Did you hear such a thing?

757
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:22,795
Did Col. Chaterjee not arrange
any entertainment for you?

758
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:25,632
Such a good friend of yours...

759
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:32,079
He did propose...
- What did you say?

760
01:17:32,440 --> 01:17:34,635
No.
Thank you.

761
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:40,797
Surprising!
- Your husband is reformed now.

762
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:42,672
Don't you know that?

763
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:46,116
How has the impossible
become possible?

764
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:49,836
Look on your right;
you will know.

765
01:17:54,720 --> 01:17:57,996
Understand?
- I'm very happy.

766
01:17:59,960 --> 01:18:02,918
But I'm not happy about one thing.
- What?

767
01:18:03,480 --> 01:18:07,155
What did Dada do that you
spoke like that in Didi's presence?

768
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:10,514
Did you see the effect
of your words on Mezda?

769
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:17,993
I would not have said anything if
he wouldn't have initiated it.

770
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:21,997
What do you know about me?

771
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:28,198
I spilled the beans.
- You mean, Didi was not hurt?

772
01:18:29,320 --> 01:18:32,312
What do you want to say?
That Bodi knows nothing about Dada?

773
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:37,077
I know she worships him.
It shows in her every word and action.

774
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:41,115
I'm sure she doesn't know.
- Then I have done her a service.

775
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:45,674
If you live in a fool's paradise,
you have to repent.

776
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:50,395
What a problematic thing
this dishonest money is.

777
01:18:51,080 --> 01:18:54,550
Since you are saying this,
I want to tell you something.

778
01:18:54,680 --> 01:18:56,193
What is that?

779
01:18:56,360 --> 01:18:59,716
This dishonest money
was not at all required.

780
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:04,400
Meaning?
- If I would get my 1/4 share.

781
01:19:04,410 --> 01:19:07,870
What rubbish are you talking?
- It's not rubbish Tapti.

782
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:13,108
The last time I was here,
Baba said he had a will.

783
01:19:13,640 --> 01:19:15,676
Equal shares among four brothers.

784
01:19:16,440 --> 01:19:19,671
Do you know the kind of wealth
Anando Majumdar possessed?

785
01:19:20,520 --> 01:19:24,374
One portion of that will solve

786
01:19:24,375 --> 01:19:28,871
all problems and pay off all debts.

787
01:19:29,680 --> 01:19:35,073
The question is when.

788
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:40,671
When and how.
- Is this your reformed character?

789
01:19:41,080 --> 01:19:45,278
If you'd just a little love for Baba,
you would not have spoken like this.

790
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:47,829
Now I know he means nothing to you.

791
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:53,833
Baba never gave me a second glance.
I don't need to feel for him.

792
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:57,916
Baba did not like you,
you mean?

793
01:19:58,440 --> 01:20:02,069
Now he does. Because of you, Dingu.
And I am a success.

794
01:20:03,680 --> 01:20:06,240
I am talking 20 years back.
Baba sent Dada and Mezda to America.

795
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:13,348
When it was my turn,
why did the rule change?

796
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:18,271
Can you think of the humiliation?
He did not think about it at all.

797
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:24,430
Maybe he didn't think so as
academically you were not that good.

798
01:20:25,720 --> 01:20:30,350
I don't know what Baba
saw or did not in me.

799
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:36,505
The moment I knew I had to fend for myself,

800
01:20:36,506 --> 01:20:39,595
I did not wait for a moment.

801
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:44,462
I started earning and drinking at 22.

802
01:20:44,463 --> 01:20:47,269
Baba was responsible for both.

803
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:54,558
I had guts to stand on my feet.
And I made it.

804
01:20:58,200 --> 01:21:01,740
When I first met you, I was 28 and

805
01:21:01,741 --> 01:21:05,072
my monthly income was ten grand.

806
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:08,553
Because I had a good income,
I proposed to you.

807
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:14,951
Why I agreed, I don't know.
We had nothing in common.

808
01:21:16,440 --> 01:21:22,151
Besides the heart, there was
another attraction... Physical.

809
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:26,449
Have you forgotten what you've

810
01:21:26,450 --> 01:21:29,439
done in the last 12 years?

811
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:31,716
No. I haven't forgotten.

812
01:21:32,840 --> 01:21:35,298
But this too is true:

813
01:21:35,299 --> 01:21:41,032
that it's been five years
since our son was born.

814
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:44,480
How do I deny it?

815
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:48,934
If you are talking about affairs,

816
01:21:48,935 --> 01:21:51,915
then I too have nothing to say.

817
01:21:54,760 --> 01:21:56,478
Are you talking about Protap?

818
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:02,795
I'm no fool, Tapti.
- You are a fool.

819
01:22:03,120 --> 01:22:07,079
Protap is my friend and
nothing else. Nothing.

820
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:09,920
And for your information.

821
01:22:09,921 --> 01:22:13,953
Protap has met a girl he wants to marry.

822
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:19,555
Forgive me, Madam.

823
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:37,878
There is still time...

824
01:23:38,440 --> 01:23:41,193
What is the news?
- You did not go to sleep.

825
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:44,433
Not so early. Insomnia.

826
01:23:44,720 --> 01:23:48,269
What are you saying!
- Yes. I cannot sleep before two.

827
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:53,116
Cigarette?
I stopped.

828
01:24:01,400 --> 01:24:05,359
Being a cardiologist, you smoke?

829
01:24:10,400 --> 01:24:15,269
It's wrong. I accept it.
I'm trying to give it up.

830
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:20,710
Sit. I didn't get to know you.

831
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:27,872
Is your Dada playing the gramophone?

832
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:30,000
Mezda.

833
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,440
Dr. Som was saying
something about him.

834
01:24:35,442 --> 01:24:37,825
Most unfortunate.

835
01:24:37,826 --> 01:24:43,826
To be reduced to this
for such a promising man.

836
01:24:45,760 --> 01:24:50,117
He has always liked music.
He still does.

837
01:24:50,600 --> 01:24:56,277
It is surprising. I have not seeing
him going into Baba's room.

838
01:24:56,680 --> 01:25:01,959
He keeps to himself.
In his world.

839
01:25:05,240 --> 01:25:10,075
I could not believe,
I could see Baba so closely.

840
01:25:11,800 --> 01:25:14,075
I've hero-worshipped
him since childhood.

841
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:21,951
In school, he was the example
of Karmveer. The doer.

842
01:25:25,960 --> 01:25:30,584
Surprising. Even in this state,

843
01:25:30,585 --> 01:25:35,358
he enquires about my well being.

844
01:25:36,280 --> 01:25:38,715
Times have changed.

845
01:25:38,716 --> 01:25:43,072
You don't see such purity anymore.

846
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:45,831
What can one say?

847
01:25:49,320 --> 01:25:52,783
The state he is in,

848
01:25:52,784 --> 01:25:58,069
can anything happen, anytime?

849
01:26:06,840 --> 01:26:08,359
Would you like to go there?

850
01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:11,433
Can I go there?
- Of course. Go on.

851
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:19,273
Come on.

852
01:28:48,320 --> 01:28:49,912
Come.

853
01:28:54,160 --> 01:28:56,674
Reduce the volume.

854
01:29:10,280 --> 01:29:11,713
Has the bulb fused?

855
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,992
Did you do it deliberately...

856
01:29:21,560 --> 01:29:22,946
Sorry Mezda.

857
01:29:22,947 --> 01:29:27,795
You were listening to
music, I interrupted.

858
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:33,517
I just wanted to know one thing.
That...

859
01:29:36,720 --> 01:29:39,792
Are you alright?

860
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:45,451
Now... good...

861
01:29:45,452 --> 01:29:49,239
I feel good. Good...

862
01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:59,590
I left my job. I've joined
a professional theater group.

863
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:06,034
Profession... Work...

864
01:30:09,200 --> 01:30:11,270
No...

865
01:30:15,120 --> 01:30:17,509
When Baba knows
he will be very upset.

866
01:30:20,160 --> 01:30:23,550
That I did not keep the respect of
the Majumdar family, Mezda.

867
01:30:24,080 --> 01:30:26,219
No one...

868
01:30:26,220 --> 01:30:32,220
Nobody can... Everybody...

869
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:02,848
Sometimes I think... You sit

870
01:31:02,849 --> 01:31:06,598
quietly in your room... humming...

871
01:31:08,240 --> 01:31:10,502
Now we are here.

872
01:31:10,503 --> 01:31:16,158
How do you pass your
time? Do you go out?

873
01:31:16,920 --> 01:31:20,596
Grass is green.

874
01:31:20,597 --> 01:31:26,477
Sky is blue. Rose is red.

875
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:28,991
Do you go to the garden?

876
01:31:30,520 --> 01:31:35,179
Seven colours of the Rainbow.

877
01:31:35,180 --> 01:31:38,552
Seven notes of music.

878
01:31:39,320 --> 01:31:42,280
Do, Re, Mi,

879
01:31:42,281 --> 01:31:45,509
et cetera...

880
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:50,555
You love music,
don't you Mezda?

881
01:31:53,800 --> 01:31:58,479
The reason for my life...

882
01:31:58,480 --> 01:32:02,222
Light in darkness...

883
01:32:02,223 --> 01:32:06,713
The easier the better...

884
01:32:15,440 --> 01:32:17,910
Brothers...

885
01:32:17,911 --> 01:32:23,074
Brothers... Brothers...

886
01:32:33,280 --> 01:32:35,748
In a way,
you are better, Mezda.

887
01:32:43,440 --> 01:32:49,276
Where man is led today...
You don't need to see that.

888
01:32:51,400 --> 01:32:54,974
I know... I know... Darkness...

889
01:32:54,975 --> 01:32:58,317
Darkness... Black... Black...

890
01:32:58,960 --> 01:33:01,997
Mezda calm down. Mezda please...
Mezda please... Mezda please...

891
01:33:35,800 --> 01:33:41,158
Alone... Alone...

892
01:33:42,240 --> 01:33:47,075
Now you are not alone. I am here.
Your brother. Protap...

893
01:33:47,400 --> 01:33:51,029
One is me... the other is you...

894
01:33:57,440 --> 01:33:59,829
Why are you here?

895
01:34:02,080 --> 01:34:06,471
Working man...
why are you here?

896
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:08,518
I will go, Mezda...

897
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:13,673
Go... Go...

898
01:35:16,640 --> 01:35:18,835
How is the report now?

899
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:22,720
Very good.

900
01:35:22,721 --> 01:35:23,873
Dadu...

901
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:27,244
Come child. Come... Come...

902
01:35:29,245 --> 01:35:32,231
Are you well now?

903
01:35:32,322 --> 01:35:36,151
Much better. Much better.
- Morning...

904
01:35:36,920 --> 01:35:40,151
Please come in.
He's much better today.

905
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:43,558
Come in everyone...

906
01:35:52,840 --> 01:35:55,513
Today you are looking
much better. Baba.

907
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:59,709
We are going tomorrow.
If need be, we will come back.

908
01:36:00,080 --> 01:36:03,436
You had to suffer
too much all these days.

909
01:36:04,240 --> 01:36:07,550
Why so much sacrifice for an old man?

910
01:36:07,720 --> 01:36:12,271
You relax, Baba.
All the tension is over now.

911
01:36:12,560 --> 01:36:17,839
Take a break today.
Go and enjoy yourselves with an outing.

912
01:36:18,080 --> 01:36:21,914
All of you go and have good time.

913
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:26,634
We are all fine at home, Baba.

914
01:36:26,635 --> 01:36:29,956
It was no trouble, Baba.

915
01:36:30,160 --> 01:36:33,492
I know how difficult it is for

916
01:36:33,493 --> 01:36:36,713
a working person to sit idle.

917
01:36:37,200 --> 01:36:42,479
Go for a day's picnic.

918
01:36:42,720 --> 01:36:45,632
Mungadi?
- Yes. Mungadi.

919
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:51,899
Go where you all used to
when you were children.

920
01:36:51,900 --> 01:36:53,876
What is your opinion, Doctor?

921
01:36:54,200 --> 01:36:57,317
Why not,
you are much better today.

922
01:36:57,680 --> 01:37:01,719
You heard what the doctor said?
- Please don't talk so much Baba.

923
01:37:01,880 --> 01:37:04,387
If you don't listen,

924
01:37:04,388 --> 01:37:09,275
I will be disturbed. Would you like it?

925
01:37:09,520 --> 01:37:15,520
Okay. We'll think about it.
Come on.

926
01:37:26,560 --> 01:37:30,792
What should we do?
I am confused.

927
01:37:31,040 --> 01:37:33,838
Listen to Baba...
Listen to Baba...

928
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,958
I think it's better to keep
Baba happy at this stage.

929
01:37:37,120 --> 01:37:42,478
Anyway we have to eat; we can carry
some simple food to the picnic.

930
01:37:42,680 --> 01:37:44,511
Bread and boiled eggs.

931
01:37:46,160 --> 01:37:48,435
Protap,
would you like to come along?

932
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:53,034
If everyone's going...
- Mezda?

933
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:59,760
Okay. Let's go to the old picnic spot.
Our Dingoo Babu will be happy.

934
01:38:00,040 --> 01:38:02,395
Mungadi...

935
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:27,431
Mungadi... Mungadi...
Mama, I'm going that way...

936
01:38:27,680 --> 01:38:30,194
Don't go too far.
- No, I won't.

937
01:38:49,280 --> 01:38:51,919
This place has not
changed even a little bit.

938
01:39:49,160 --> 01:39:51,628
I've gone back 20 years in age.

939
01:39:51,920 --> 01:39:56,436
Continue... I haven't heard you
sing for so long. You've a sweet voice.

940
01:40:04,160 --> 01:40:09,280
It's been a long time since I stopped.
Before Dingu's birth.

941
01:40:10,720 --> 01:40:12,517
It just came to me here.

942
01:40:13,960 --> 01:40:18,590
You remember the last
time we were here.

943
01:40:19,560 --> 01:40:23,109
I think I was in
school at that time.

944
01:40:24,920 --> 01:40:30,920
You and Proshanto were in school.
Protap a baby.

945
01:40:31,200 --> 01:40:34,703
I went to Calcutta to

946
01:40:34,704 --> 01:40:39,039
study the same year. 1959.

947
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:43,471
We had a lot of fun at that time.

948
01:40:43,760 --> 01:40:46,115
What kind?
- Tongue twisters.

949
01:40:48,480 --> 01:40:52,712
What's that?
Tongue twisters.

950
01:40:53,360 --> 01:40:55,954
Words that twist your
tongue while speaking them.

951
01:40:56,160 --> 01:40:59,550
She sells sea shells
on the sea shore.

952
01:41:00,240 --> 01:41:02,598
That's a simple one.

953
01:41:02,599 --> 01:41:07,669
The one Baba used to
say was very difficult.

954
01:41:07,960 --> 01:41:10,713
That's in Bengali.
Listen.

955
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:15,079
Jale chun ta ja,
tele chul ta ja.

956
01:41:16,240 --> 01:41:18,913
Jale...
What is the rest?

957
01:41:19,440 --> 01:41:23,638
Jale chun ta ja,
tele chul ta ja.

958
01:41:24,800 --> 01:41:26,756
That is very simple.

959
01:41:26,880 --> 01:41:31,078
You have to say it very fast.

960
01:41:31,720 --> 01:41:33,995
Fast?
- Fast.

961
01:41:34,280 --> 01:41:36,430
Give it a try,
Bodi.

962
01:41:37,240 --> 01:41:41,597
Jale chun ta ja, tele chul ta ja.
- Now faster.

963
01:41:54,440 --> 01:41:56,510
Enough laughter.
Now you say it.

964
01:42:12,800 --> 01:42:16,759
That was very tough.
- Protap...

965
01:42:18,720 --> 01:42:20,517
Come and join us...

966
01:42:22,640 --> 01:42:27,270
Proshanto was the real talent.
- Really?

967
01:42:27,720 --> 01:42:32,589
You did not know him then.
Outstanding student.

968
01:42:33,440 --> 01:42:37,718
He was equally outstanding
in studies and games.

969
01:42:39,720 --> 01:42:45,158
Really. It's so sad.
The mere thought of it.

970
01:42:45,360 --> 01:42:47,351
There's coffee in the flask.
Anybody for coffee?

971
01:42:51,520 --> 01:42:55,991
Protap... Coffee?

972
01:42:57,560 --> 01:43:00,836
Me too.
Give me a little.

973
01:43:17,040 --> 01:43:20,794
Do you have some disease?
That you are running away from us?

974
01:43:26,320 --> 01:43:31,838
Coming to a picnic and brooding
silence all around. I don't like it at all.

975
01:43:32,160 --> 01:43:36,278
Please don't fight now.
Let him be quiet if he so wishes.

976
01:43:36,600 --> 01:43:40,798
It's been two days since
he's spoken to anyone. Is it right?

977
01:43:52,240 --> 01:43:54,993
He has gone to irritate Protap.

978
01:44:05,080 --> 01:44:08,868
You still call yourself a Marxist?

979
01:44:10,600 --> 01:44:15,879
Why this question?
Do you have absolutely any interest in it?

980
01:44:28,080 --> 01:44:31,595
Please sit with us...
Why are you keeping so aloof?

981
01:44:31,920 --> 01:44:34,480
Please come and sit.
Sit... Sit...

982
01:44:37,840 --> 01:44:41,674
How can we enjoy a picnic alone?

983
01:44:46,960 --> 01:44:51,431
Understood.
I think I've got it.

984
01:44:55,760 --> 01:45:01,278
He has stopped talking, considering
the condition of socialism. Right?

985
01:45:02,640 --> 01:45:05,632
Picnics and politics don't mix.

986
01:45:08,920 --> 01:45:11,309
That's right. Change the subject.
- What? Cinema?

987
01:45:11,440 --> 01:45:14,079
I have not seen a film in
a theater for a long time.

988
01:45:14,320 --> 01:45:18,552
Same here. These days movies
are watched at home.

989
01:45:18,760 --> 01:45:21,194
Protap do you watch films?

990
01:45:21,400 --> 01:45:24,510
I don't have a VCR. But if I hear

991
01:45:24,511 --> 01:45:27,714
of a good film, I go and watch it.

992
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,758
I love watching films.

993
01:45:30,759 --> 01:45:34,519
But he has no interest at all.

994
01:45:35,040 --> 01:45:38,350
I watch the Mahabharata.
I haven't missed a single episode.

995
01:45:38,680 --> 01:45:44,152
Oh Bodi. I watched one episode
and lost all interest.

996
01:45:44,680 --> 01:45:50,471
Mama...
I saw two lizards...

997
01:45:50,960 --> 01:45:54,236
Did you go very far?
No...

998
01:45:54,440 --> 01:45:57,876
Aren't you hungry?
- No. Not hungry.

999
01:45:58,080 --> 01:46:01,072
But we are soon going to have lunch.
Come back quickly.

1000
01:46:01,280 --> 01:46:03,236
Okay...

1001
01:46:21,680 --> 01:46:26,356
Your grumpy attitude isn't
going well with the picnic spirit.

1002
01:46:26,480 --> 01:46:28,675
Why are you
irritating him so much?

1003
01:46:29,040 --> 01:46:33,504
Baba's now fine. Yet he's quiet and mum.

1004
01:46:33,505 --> 01:46:36,071
Should we not know why?

1005
01:46:36,360 --> 01:46:40,831
Is there any problem in your agency?

1006
01:46:41,080 --> 01:46:43,203
I hear in the market

1007
01:46:43,204 --> 01:46:48,191
that they don't have as
much goodwill as before.

1008
01:46:51,320 --> 01:46:56,519
Come on Protap.
Open your mouth. Open up.

1009
01:46:59,520 --> 01:47:03,589
Okay... I'm tried of listening

1010
01:47:03,590 --> 01:47:06,437
to your one question.

1011
01:47:07,040 --> 01:47:11,716
Now listen.
I have resigned from my job.

1012
01:47:12,040 --> 01:47:13,632
Oh... Why?
- What?

1013
01:47:14,240 --> 01:47:16,071
Now the curtain raises.

1014
01:47:16,280 --> 01:47:20,671
Why did you do that?
Why?

1015
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:24,629
You would not
like to hear the reasons.

1016
01:47:24,840 --> 01:47:28,071
We will listen.
This is a serious matter. Tell.

1017
01:47:29,440 --> 01:47:31,556
Then listen.

1018
01:47:36,600 --> 01:47:42,600
The values and ethics in today's jobs
are not acceptable to me.

1019
01:47:43,280 --> 01:47:48,638
How man stoops
for dishonest money...

1020
01:47:49,160 --> 01:47:52,755
I have seen it
and my eyes have opened.

1021
01:47:53,280 --> 01:47:57,653
I don't have a job or business.

1022
01:47:57,654 --> 01:48:03,155
I don't want a dual life. I want peace.

1023
01:48:04,360 --> 01:48:10,037
I want to stay as far as possible
from corruption. I want a simple life.

1024
01:48:12,400 --> 01:48:16,871
And one more thing.
I have joined a professional theater.

1025
01:48:17,920 --> 01:48:22,005
This is meaningless coming from

1026
01:48:22,006 --> 01:48:26,749
a 34 year old of an affluent family.

1027
01:48:27,440 --> 01:48:32,150
There are many more like me who
don't live in your kind of world.

1028
01:48:32,800 --> 01:48:34,279
That's why you don't know them.
I want to be one of them.

1029
01:48:35,360 --> 01:48:40,514
Yes. You want to
come up like Baba.

1030
01:48:40,800 --> 01:48:46,397
Please Sezda, no double talk.
Don't take both names together.

1031
01:48:53,480 --> 01:48:59,157
Baba is a great man.
I don't come anywhere close to his deeds.

1032
01:48:59,360 --> 01:49:04,036
He achieved the peak from
scratch without a compromise.

1033
01:49:04,200 --> 01:49:09,035
What are we?

1034
01:49:09,200 --> 01:49:12,272
You have 3 houses and 2 cars;
does that make you exceptional?

1035
01:49:12,920 --> 01:49:18,517
We are ordinary. Mediocre.
You, me, Dada. All of us.

1036
01:49:18,960 --> 01:49:24,717
We have only taken,
not made any contribution... Nothing.

1037
01:49:26,080 --> 01:49:30,358
When we die...
nobody will remember us.

1038
01:49:30,840 --> 01:49:33,991
Enough... Please stop...
Let's eat now.

1039
01:49:34,520 --> 01:49:37,398
Dingu...
- Yes?

1040
01:49:37,640 --> 01:49:40,473
Come and eat...
- I'm coming...

1041
01:49:43,600 --> 01:49:47,798
Will you agree to one thing?
- What?

1042
01:49:48,480 --> 01:49:51,153
Are you not feeling light
after speaking you mind?

1043
01:49:51,960 --> 01:49:54,155
Yes.
I do.

1044
01:50:20,440 --> 01:50:23,989
How is he?
He's alright. Wants to meet you all.

1045
01:50:24,200 --> 01:50:27,431
We were anyway going to him.
Come.

1046
01:50:34,440 --> 01:50:38,115
We obeyed your orders, Baba.
- Did you enjoy yourselves?

1047
01:50:38,320 --> 01:50:39,833
Ask your daughters-in-law...

1048
01:50:40,120 --> 01:50:45,478
It was a great picnic.
- We really enjoyed ourselves.

1049
01:50:45,640 --> 01:50:50,430
And did you enjoy yourself, Dadu?
- I saw two lizards.

1050
01:50:50,840 --> 01:50:56,840
Now you can go back peacefully.

1051
01:50:56,842 --> 01:51:02,742
I don't think you need to come back.

1052
01:51:03,760 --> 01:51:05,671
What do you say, doctor?

1053
01:51:07,040 --> 01:51:08,951
That's what we all wish for.

1054
01:51:09,360 --> 01:51:13,528
These old bones are still very strong

1055
01:51:13,529 --> 01:51:17,358
Probodh. They will go on for long.

1056
01:51:17,720 --> 01:51:20,396
What are you saying, Baba.

1057
01:51:20,397 --> 01:51:24,512
We are at peace knowing you are with us.

1058
01:51:24,800 --> 01:51:28,759
Give me your hand.

1059
01:51:31,040 --> 01:51:33,554
I do not feel like going at all.

1060
01:51:35,520 --> 01:51:38,034
I could have stayed some more days.

1061
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:44,786
Baba says to go back without a worry...

1062
01:51:44,787 --> 01:51:47,239
But how can I not worry?

1063
01:51:50,200 --> 01:51:53,690
I'm worried about Protap.

1064
01:51:53,691 --> 01:51:58,437
He will do very well in theater.

1065
01:51:59,200 --> 01:52:03,113
I have seen his acting.
- That even I have.

1066
01:52:04,560 --> 01:52:07,639
But what he said today

1067
01:52:07,640 --> 01:52:11,557
is not pertaining to acting.

1068
01:52:11,920 --> 01:52:17,920
He spoke what he believes in.

1069
01:52:18,720 --> 01:52:22,793
There is not a single doubt about it.

1070
01:52:34,400 --> 01:52:39,076
You knew about Protap, right?
- Yes.

1071
01:52:41,240 --> 01:52:47,240
I knew from the
look on your face.

1072
01:52:49,160 --> 01:52:52,869
He really gave it to us.
He has guts.

1073
01:52:54,440 --> 01:52:58,194
Please note that your
1/4 share will not work.

1074
01:52:58,680 --> 01:53:00,668
I know it.

1075
01:53:00,669 --> 01:53:06,669
I'd forgotten they aren't corrupt.

1076
01:53:08,480 --> 01:53:10,152
That means your
debts won't be paid up.

1077
01:53:11,760 --> 01:53:15,309
Debts of habitual
gamblers never get paid.

1078
01:53:16,680 --> 01:53:20,309
Do you know what can happen?

1079
01:53:20,560 --> 01:53:22,755
What?

1080
01:53:24,680 --> 01:53:29,470
I can repay your debts.

1081
01:53:34,480 --> 01:53:39,190
How will it happen?
- It will happen... It will happen...

1082
01:53:39,840 --> 01:53:42,223
I'm trying...

1083
01:53:42,224 --> 01:53:46,439
Have a little patience.

1084
01:53:53,040 --> 01:53:55,547
Can't you?

1085
01:53:55,548 --> 01:53:59,559
Yes. I'll try.

1086
01:54:44,160 --> 01:54:49,314
Come Dadu, come.
- I have come before everyone.

1087
01:54:50,200 --> 01:54:54,352
You are a big boy now.
- Yes. I know many things too.

1088
01:54:54,560 --> 01:54:58,792
Many things?

1089
01:54:59,320 --> 01:55:03,916
Mama told me how
Tintin saw the Yeti.

1090
01:55:04,400 --> 01:55:07,597
You know Yeti?
- I know more too.

1091
01:55:07,760 --> 01:55:13,198
More?
- I know Mechamo, Windinbomb...

1092
01:55:13,480 --> 01:55:17,758
What is that?
- Windinbomb... where they play tennis.

1093
01:55:18,280 --> 01:55:22,876
I know honest and dishonest money.
- What?

1094
01:55:23,160 --> 01:55:26,516
I know honest and dishonest money.

1095
01:55:33,120 --> 01:55:36,749
How do you know?

1096
01:55:37,520 --> 01:55:40,432
Baba was talking to Jetu about it.
Very loudly. I heard everything.

1097
01:55:40,560 --> 01:55:45,839
You have dishonest money;
I have dishonest money...

1098
01:55:46,040 --> 01:55:47,678
I heard everything.

1099
01:55:47,840 --> 01:55:52,197
What do you have Dadu?

1100
01:55:57,760 --> 01:56:03,756
Baba,
we will leave now.

1101
01:56:04,200 --> 01:56:07,636
We've asked Jagdish Babu to call everyday.
We'll call you too.

1102
01:56:07,880 --> 01:56:13,671
You lost too much...

1103
01:56:14,080 --> 01:56:15,991
You don't have to think
about all that, Baba.

1104
01:56:16,360 --> 01:56:19,193
We should get news that
you are getting well.

1105
01:56:19,520 --> 01:56:22,193
We'll get going Baba.

1106
01:56:28,600 --> 01:56:30,352
I am going Dadu.

1107
01:56:36,320 --> 01:56:38,629
What happened?

1108
01:56:39,240 --> 01:56:42,683
I can't bear to see Baba like this.

1109
01:56:42,684 --> 01:56:45,634
I don't feel like leaving him.

1110
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:50,790
We will come back, if required.
- He looks so sad.

1111
01:56:50,960 --> 01:56:54,236
Don't cry Didi. Baba will be alright.
Don't worry.

1112
01:56:54,480 --> 01:56:57,836
Come on now.
Come...

1113
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:11,268
Okay Proshanto. Look after Baba.

1114
01:57:11,269 --> 01:57:13,269
We are leaving.

1115
01:57:18,200 --> 01:57:21,342
What did I hear...

1116
01:57:21,343 --> 01:57:25,880
What did I hear... What...

1117
01:57:36,800 --> 01:57:39,234
What did I hear...

1118
01:57:55,400 --> 01:58:00,110
Car... Car...
- Yes... Yes, it's a car.

1119
01:58:28,280 --> 01:58:29,480
Baba...

1120
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:48,000
Who? Proshanto... Please come...

1121
01:58:48,720 --> 01:58:54,238
Come closer.

1122
01:59:07,320 --> 01:59:11,880
You are my everything,

1123
01:59:11,881 --> 01:59:13,953
Proshanto.

1124
01:59:17,320 --> 01:59:22,075
You are my everything...

1125
01:59:53,520 --> 01:59:57,297
Shanti...

1126
01:59:57,298 --> 02:00:01,074
Shanti...

1127
02:00:02,305 --> 02:01:02,735
