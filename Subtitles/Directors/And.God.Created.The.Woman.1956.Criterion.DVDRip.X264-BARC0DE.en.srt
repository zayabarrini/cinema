1
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:54,692
GOD CREATED WOMAN

2
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:14,939
You have the feet of a queen.

3
00:03:15,842 --> 00:03:17,935
Mr. Carradine, you have
a devil of a nerve.

4
00:03:19,012 --> 00:03:20,377
l brought the apple.

5
00:03:20,947 --> 00:03:21,914
Which apple?

6
00:03:22,883 --> 00:03:23,941
The forbidden fruit.

7
00:03:25,085 --> 00:03:27,349
l said l might give you a car.

8
00:03:27,621 --> 00:03:28,952
You have a car for me?

9
00:03:30,524 --> 00:03:31,422
ls it here?

10
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:33,448
l came with it.

11
00:03:33,927 --> 00:03:34,951
What is it?

12
00:03:36,029 --> 00:03:37,963
A red Simca convertible.

13
00:03:38,365 --> 00:03:39,389
Where is it?

14
00:03:44,404 --> 00:03:45,530
You got me.

15
00:03:48,341 --> 00:03:49,365
Not yet.

16
00:03:53,713 --> 00:03:54,702
lt's pretty.

17
00:03:55,315 --> 00:03:56,475
You'll have the same one.

18
00:04:01,421 --> 00:04:03,719
With that mouth you can have
anything you want.

19
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:08,985
I'm a gold-digger.

20
00:04:09,396 --> 00:04:10,522
l don't think so.

21
00:04:15,535 --> 00:04:16,661
l'm in for it now.

22
00:04:18,772 --> 00:04:19,500
Hello, Mr. Carradine.

23
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:20,469
Good afternoon.

24
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,268
You should be at the bookstore.
Of course you'd rather

25
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:25,935
show yourself off naked
in front of men. Little slut!

26
00:04:26,947 --> 00:04:29,575
l take her out of the orphanage
and this is the thanks l get.

27
00:04:29,816 --> 00:04:30,612
But l work.

28
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:31,910
Fine way to work.

29
00:04:33,753 --> 00:04:35,311
lt's all my fault.

30
00:04:35,722 --> 00:04:37,053
Don't believe that,
Mr. Carradine.

31
00:04:37,724 --> 00:04:39,692
l am the one responsible for
making her late.

32
00:04:40,093 --> 00:04:41,890
l'd like to make it up to you.

33
00:04:42,062 --> 00:04:45,293
Please don't. The honor of
this house is not for sale.

34
00:04:45,799 --> 00:04:48,290
Honor is a delicate word...

35
00:04:48,935 --> 00:04:50,596
lt demands a lot of heart.

36
00:04:50,804 --> 00:04:51,736
Goodbye, Mr. Carradine.

37
00:05:14,861 --> 00:05:17,022
You were watching too,
you dirty old man.

38
00:05:17,397 --> 00:05:18,591
Well, l heard your voice.

39
00:05:21,601 --> 00:05:24,468
You won't laugh long!
l have a surprise for you.

40
00:05:25,472 --> 00:05:28,407
You know what people say about
you in town? You don't care.

41
00:05:28,642 --> 00:05:30,633
Well, l do. You little slut!

42
00:05:31,411 --> 00:05:32,639
Well, will you answer me?

43
00:05:34,381 --> 00:05:35,712
lf at least you
were a hard worker.

44
00:05:35,982 --> 00:05:38,314
Mrs. Marquand told me you waited
on her barefoot yesterday.

45
00:05:38,518 --> 00:05:39,644
ls that good salesmanship?

46
00:05:39,886 --> 00:05:41,012
Are you going to say something?

47
00:05:41,354 --> 00:05:42,844
-Will it make a difference?
-Definitely not.

48
00:05:42,989 --> 00:05:44,786
Then why should l?

49
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:47,684
Oh! You!

50
00:05:50,964 --> 00:05:53,626
l've got a nice surprise
for you.

51
00:06:22,395 --> 00:06:24,056
The architect and Mr. Roger
are in the office.

52
00:06:25,498 --> 00:06:27,363
l'm not sure if Jerome
mentioned it,

53
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,968
but l'd like to repaint the back
room. lt'll be ready for Easter.

54
00:06:30,737 --> 00:06:31,795
l trust you.

55
00:06:41,014 --> 00:06:42,072
l'm afraid l'm late.

56
00:06:42,382 --> 00:06:43,974
No problem. Working on
a new deal?

57
00:06:44,551 --> 00:06:47,418
Yes, and it's going well.
What about our project?

58
00:06:47,721 --> 00:06:48,710
Any problems?

59
00:06:48,888 --> 00:06:50,685
The site looks ideal.

60
00:06:51,024 --> 00:06:54,425
We'll build the casino
left of the road right here...

61
00:06:54,694 --> 00:06:57,026
and save the pinewoods
for the hotel.

62
00:06:57,564 --> 00:07:00,590
But you'll need to own all
the land up to the cape.

63
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:04,734
No problem there -
except for the Tardieu shipyard.

64
00:07:04,971 --> 00:07:06,438
Leave that glass alone.

65
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:10,441
You turn yellow when you drink
and l hate yellow.

66
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:13,376
How are the talks going
with the Tardieus?

67
00:07:13,613 --> 00:07:15,843
They don't want to sell. One of
the older brothers is against it

68
00:07:16,316 --> 00:07:16,907
Which one?

69
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:18,574
The eldest, the one who lives
in Toulon.

70
00:07:18,718 --> 00:07:20,015
He's coming in for the weekend.

71
00:07:20,553 --> 00:07:22,453
You'd best talk to him yourself.

72
00:07:26,893 --> 00:07:30,522
Antoine, check out that girl.
Her ass is a song.

73
00:07:42,642 --> 00:07:43,631
What's up?

74
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:44,868
l have a flat.

75
00:07:46,513 --> 00:07:47,537
l couldn't tell.

76
00:07:53,286 --> 00:07:55,686
Oh, you're so cute.
He's adorable.

77
00:07:57,757 --> 00:07:58,781
Antoine!!

78
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:04,619
You take the bus?

79
00:08:05,365 --> 00:08:06,559
l got a flat.

80
00:08:09,903 --> 00:08:11,530
Every time l see you, you're
more beautiful than the last.

81
00:08:12,038 --> 00:08:13,471
You should really stop.

82
00:08:16,509 --> 00:08:17,703
Are you having fun in Toulon?

83
00:08:18,278 --> 00:08:19,438
l'm working.

84
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:21,312
You should come back.

85
00:08:21,581 --> 00:08:22,843
l have a better future there.

86
00:08:22,982 --> 00:08:26,247
All the future does
is spoil the present.

87
00:08:31,457 --> 00:08:33,584
Here's the shipyard.
Are you getting off, Antoine?

88
00:08:36,996 --> 00:08:38,327
Are you going to the dance
tonight?

89
00:08:38,665 --> 00:08:39,791
l always do.

90
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,396
Good.

91
00:09:01,554 --> 00:09:02,748
What's for lunch?

92
00:09:03,823 --> 00:09:05,256
Goddamnit! Lentils again!

93
00:09:05,391 --> 00:09:06,858
lt's good for your health.

94
00:09:07,026 --> 00:09:08,857
Did you have a good trip?

95
00:09:09,329 --> 00:09:10,489
When l get a car,
it'll be better.

96
00:09:10,663 --> 00:09:12,460
-How's my son?
-Hi Mom.

97
00:09:15,568 --> 00:09:16,830
l can finally breathe here.

98
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:20,937
What's up with you?
You guys seem busy.

99
00:09:21,641 --> 00:09:23,541
Same old story,
not enough depth here.

100
00:09:23,676 --> 00:09:25,576
All the good jobs go to
the port's shipyard.

101
00:09:25,712 --> 00:09:28,306
-As long as you guys can eat.
-You're right, son.

102
00:09:28,681 --> 00:09:30,478
This one seems in pretty poor
shape.

103
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,650
Carradine wants to buy our land.

104
00:09:32,852 --> 00:09:34,251
Let him try.

105
00:09:34,487 --> 00:09:35,852
Maybe it wouldn't be
such a bad idea to sell.

106
00:09:36,022 --> 00:09:37,284
Never.

107
00:09:39,392 --> 00:09:42,486
l ran into Juliette on the bus.
She's a real woman now.

108
00:09:43,396 --> 00:09:46,388
l know, because the bus
was crowded.

109
00:09:46,566 --> 00:09:48,932
-She's got no shame, that girl.
-She's got something else.

110
00:09:49,402 --> 00:09:50,596
l hope you're not falling.

111
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:51,600
Why not?

112
00:09:52,472 --> 00:09:53,632
She hasn't waited for you.

113
00:09:53,806 --> 00:09:55,068
l never said l wanted to be
the first.

114
00:09:56,643 --> 00:09:58,770
Nobody even knows where
that tart is from.

115
00:09:58,912 --> 00:10:00,937
Her father was a captain
in the merchant marines.

116
00:10:01,281 --> 00:10:02,748
lt's no excuse for her faults.

117
00:10:03,516 --> 00:10:05,347
Her biggest fault is that
her parents are dead.

118
00:10:05,685 --> 00:10:07,016
You seem well-informed.

119
00:10:09,289 --> 00:10:11,985
Sometimes when l go
to the bookstore, we chat.

120
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:14,317
l can't wait for tonight.

121
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:15,688
You're such a romantic.

122
00:10:15,929 --> 00:10:16,953
He's so handsome.

123
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:18,590
Not enough to afford
to be broke.

124
00:10:18,765 --> 00:10:19,993
Better than your Rene.

125
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,928
Rene gives me presents.
One, two...

126
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:27,300
That's not it. You're doing
the Mambo. Let me show you.

127
00:10:35,815 --> 00:10:37,043
See, like this.

128
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:45,548
Eric Carradine came to see me.

129
00:10:47,026 --> 00:10:50,518
So, Mr. Tardieu, l'd like
to buy your shipyard.

130
00:10:50,964 --> 00:10:52,431
Yours isn't enough?

131
00:10:52,832 --> 00:10:56,700
l want to build a hotel.
All l need is your land.

132
00:10:57,103 --> 00:10:59,970
We live off that shipyard.
Nobody'll take it.

133
00:11:00,707 --> 00:11:03,540
Who's talking about taking?
l want to buy it.

134
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:04,936
l can give you 4 million.

135
00:11:05,345 --> 00:11:06,039
4 million...

136
00:11:06,346 --> 00:11:08,007
We wouldn't get very far.

137
00:11:08,648 --> 00:11:09,979
You could have
a little shop...

138
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,012
We're not grocers.

139
00:11:12,518 --> 00:11:14,986
lt might not be such a bad idea.
Your business is dying.

140
00:11:15,688 --> 00:11:16,655
What do you know?

141
00:11:16,889 --> 00:11:18,754
You had to take another job.

142
00:11:19,092 --> 00:11:20,286
That's my business.

143
00:11:22,362 --> 00:11:23,090
Of course.

144
00:11:23,529 --> 00:11:26,555
l need an answer within
two months. Think it over.

145
00:11:27,433 --> 00:11:28,331
l have.

146
00:11:28,601 --> 00:11:29,727
As you wish.

147
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:32,895
Goodbye gentlemen.
Thanks for coming down.

148
00:11:34,974 --> 00:11:35,963
You coming, Christian?

149
00:11:36,909 --> 00:11:41,608
Here kid. You can listen to it
at home.

150
00:11:42,648 --> 00:11:43,808
Thanks, Mr. Carradine.

151
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,717
People like him don't scare me.

152
00:11:48,955 --> 00:11:50,422
Maybe we shouldn't have come.

153
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:54,556
Hey, l scored a record.

154
00:11:54,894 --> 00:11:55,918
So what?

155
00:11:57,930 --> 00:11:59,557
Raise your offer.
They'll end up giving in.

156
00:11:59,732 --> 00:12:01,063
What are you saying?

157
00:12:01,734 --> 00:12:04,259
lf l give them 20 million
for a shipyard that's worth 2,

158
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:05,767
they'll smell a rat.

159
00:12:05,972 --> 00:12:07,872
lf certain people hear
that we're building a casino

160
00:12:08,007 --> 00:12:10,908
in St. Tropez, they'll get upset
and we may have trouble.

161
00:12:11,444 --> 00:12:12,809
l didn't ask for your opinion.

162
00:12:19,652 --> 00:12:20,846
You idiot! lt's cold!

163
00:12:21,387 --> 00:12:22,513
Come on, l'll warm you up.

164
00:12:24,557 --> 00:12:25,524
Hold this for me.

165
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:35,357
Look at how handsome Antoine is.

166
00:12:35,835 --> 00:12:36,824
l think he's ugly.

167
00:12:36,969 --> 00:12:38,300
But Denise told me...

168
00:12:40,907 --> 00:12:42,465
Hey, l'm taking root.

169
00:12:42,642 --> 00:12:44,303
l'll come back and water you.

170
00:12:52,952 --> 00:12:54,943
Denise, be a lamb and hold this
for me.

171
00:13:02,061 --> 00:13:03,289
Watch and learn.

172
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:05,354
l need a new face first.

173
00:13:05,865 --> 00:13:06,729
Why?

174
00:13:07,934 --> 00:13:10,334
Do you know the story about
the worm who loved a star?

175
00:13:10,803 --> 00:13:12,395
No. How does it end?

176
00:13:13,973 --> 00:13:14,837
Badly.

177
00:13:16,008 --> 00:13:17,498
l know the song about the
caterpillar

178
00:13:17,643 --> 00:13:18,769
who loves a butterfly.

179
00:13:19,412 --> 00:13:20,470
How does it end?

180
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:21,576
Well.

181
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:32,758
l don't feel like talking.

182
00:13:34,293 --> 00:13:37,353
But if l don't talk...
l want to kiss you.

183
00:13:43,302 --> 00:13:44,428
l am a fool.

184
00:13:45,071 --> 00:13:47,596
l waited a year before
l realized you were made for me.

185
00:13:48,908 --> 00:13:50,808
l've waited a year for you
to say that.

186
00:13:51,043 --> 00:13:52,010
Yes, but l have an excuse.

187
00:13:52,345 --> 00:13:53,334
What?

188
00:13:54,714 --> 00:13:55,772
You were a kid.

189
00:14:00,853 --> 00:14:01,979
l'm taking you to Toulon.

190
00:14:02,822 --> 00:14:04,756
Monday, you'll take
the bus with me.

191
00:14:09,428 --> 00:14:10,395
You don't believe me?

192
00:14:11,297 --> 00:14:12,286
We'll see.

193
00:14:12,965 --> 00:14:13,932
Can you come?

194
00:14:14,901 --> 00:14:16,425
l'll do whatever you want.

195
00:14:19,338 --> 00:14:20,600
Would you kiss me?

196
00:14:24,977 --> 00:14:25,944
Kiss me.

197
00:14:51,971 --> 00:14:54,804
She's not for us. Might as well
let Antoine have her.

198
00:14:56,042 --> 00:14:57,031
Come and dance.

199
00:14:57,343 --> 00:14:59,004
Go ahead. l always
get turned down.

200
00:14:59,712 --> 00:15:00,736
Your technique is all wrong.

201
00:15:00,913 --> 00:15:04,007
With women you always have to
be sure of yourself. Come on.

202
00:15:10,489 --> 00:15:11,922
You're lucky. l'm free
for this dance.

203
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,624
Do you want to dance?

204
00:15:21,901 --> 00:15:23,061
Hold this.

205
00:15:23,502 --> 00:15:24,935
l can't. l have to hold the bag.

206
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:38,380
This is my favorite tune.

207
00:15:40,853 --> 00:15:41,979
lt's the first time
l've heard it.

208
00:15:46,692 --> 00:15:47,624
Me too.

209
00:15:54,567 --> 00:15:55,465
Not here...

210
00:15:56,569 --> 00:15:57,763
l'll meet you at the harbor.

211
00:16:19,892 --> 00:16:21,450
You seem to be having fun.

212
00:16:21,627 --> 00:16:22,787
Have you ever known me not to?

213
00:16:23,362 --> 00:16:24,727
It seems to be going well
with Juliette.

214
00:16:24,864 --> 00:16:26,297
I'm going to have her tonight.

215
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:29,396
You don't waste any time
flirting, do you?

216
00:16:29,602 --> 00:16:31,593
Girls like Juliette are good
for one night

217
00:16:31,771 --> 00:16:33,932
then you forget them.

218
00:16:34,307 --> 00:16:35,569
What if she's a clinger?

219
00:16:36,008 --> 00:16:37,839
I'm going back to Toulon.
She'll forget.

220
00:16:39,378 --> 00:16:40,538
You'll have to tell her
something.

221
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,045
My boss wants me to marry
his niece.

222
00:16:42,882 --> 00:16:43,849
What about her?

223
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:45,610
It's everything she wants.

224
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:48,946
Wait for me.

225
00:17:52,518 --> 00:17:54,452
lt's my turn to pay you a visit.

226
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,952
l love such surprises. May l?
Miss Juliette...

227
00:17:59,658 --> 00:18:00,784
Hardy.

228
00:18:01,293 --> 00:18:02,521
Mrs. Vigier-Lefranc.

229
00:18:02,695 --> 00:18:03,593
Good evening.

230
00:18:04,697 --> 00:18:06,858
l bought it on the port.
l'll give you the address.

231
00:18:08,768 --> 00:18:11,760
Mr. Vigier-Lefranc,
Miss Juliette Hardy.

232
00:18:12,905 --> 00:18:14,338
Delighted.

233
00:18:14,473 --> 00:18:16,407
Don't look smart and change
that record.

234
00:18:23,516 --> 00:18:24,915
Eric, you're a lost cause.

235
00:18:26,652 --> 00:18:27,482
Really?

236
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,544
You're about to fall in love.

237
00:18:30,923 --> 00:18:32,254
How can you tell?

238
00:18:33,058 --> 00:18:35,526
When you look at her,
you don't seem as intelligent.

239
00:18:37,296 --> 00:18:38,854
Ever hear of Vigier sugar?

240
00:18:40,433 --> 00:18:43,493
That's me. Ever heard of Lefranc
vacuum cleaners?

241
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:45,628
That's me.

242
00:18:46,071 --> 00:18:48,699
Will you come and dance
the cha-cha?

243
00:18:48,974 --> 00:18:50,771
Never with a vacuum cleaner.

244
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:54,443
She'll never get anywhere.
She doesn't like money.

245
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:56,280
Marcel, you've had enough.

246
00:18:56,415 --> 00:19:01,944
Not yet. l'm okay. You'll see.
From ten steps away. One, two...

247
00:19:02,388 --> 00:19:03,946
lt's a cocktail
l invented myself.

248
00:19:05,324 --> 00:19:06,450
No thanks.

249
00:19:15,701 --> 00:19:16,929
ls he waiting for you?

250
00:19:17,903 --> 00:19:18,767
Fire!

251
00:19:19,772 --> 00:19:20,739
Missed.

252
00:19:21,974 --> 00:19:23,032
lt just caught me
off guard.

253
00:19:23,342 --> 00:19:27,836
You're bleeding. Let's put
some alcohol on it. Come on.

254
00:19:28,614 --> 00:19:31,515
Really, l do apologize...

255
00:19:31,817 --> 00:19:33,785
You've always been
a nasty drunk.

256
00:19:33,953 --> 00:19:35,818
l'm a clumsy drunk,
lt's not the same.

257
00:19:36,522 --> 00:19:37,511
Not for everyone.

258
00:19:42,695 --> 00:19:44,322
l thought l had alcohol.

259
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:46,397
l know a better treatment.

260
00:19:47,032 --> 00:19:48,021
What's that?

261
00:19:53,472 --> 00:19:56,373
lt's dangerous. You won't
ever forget me.

262
00:19:57,910 --> 00:19:59,275
l'll risk it.

263
00:20:19,932 --> 00:20:20,921
Why did you come?

264
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:24,633
l don't know. Or maybe l do.
Or maybe not.

265
00:20:24,803 --> 00:20:26,600
Don't ask stupid questions.

266
00:20:30,509 --> 00:20:31,703
What are you thinking about?

267
00:20:32,478 --> 00:20:36,346
Another useless question.
You can never answer the truth.

268
00:20:37,983 --> 00:20:39,678
l thought you could.

269
00:20:42,788 --> 00:20:44,050
ls he still there?

270
00:20:47,326 --> 00:20:48,418
Antoine?

271
00:20:54,967 --> 00:20:58,698
Yes. Does that bother you?

272
00:20:59,838 --> 00:21:01,032
l don't give a damn.

273
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,640
Get out of here.

274
00:21:26,065 --> 00:21:27,930
l hope she'll live.
Where is she?

275
00:21:28,534 --> 00:21:29,558
She's gone.

276
00:21:29,868 --> 00:21:31,597
Gone? Why?

277
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:35,863
Because she's brave enough to do
what she wants when she wants.

278
00:21:39,078 --> 00:21:40,875
Nice going! At least you don't
waste any time.

279
00:21:43,449 --> 00:21:47,044
I don't care,
I don't give a damn...

280
00:22:24,056 --> 00:22:25,353
You seem to like it.

281
00:22:28,394 --> 00:22:29,656
What got into you back there?

282
00:22:30,429 --> 00:22:31,088
Nothing.

283
00:22:35,334 --> 00:22:36,961
Shall l wait for you
at the bus stop tomorrow?

284
00:22:37,469 --> 00:22:38,561
l said l would take you with me.

285
00:22:38,704 --> 00:22:39,898
You didn't mean it.

286
00:22:40,673 --> 00:22:41,697
l did. You'll see.

287
00:22:49,581 --> 00:22:50,479
See you tomorrow.

288
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:53,112
Let's stay together tonight.

289
00:22:54,019 --> 00:22:55,418
Or else you won't take me?

290
00:22:56,555 --> 00:22:57,954
Don't be a child.
That has nothing to do with it.

291
00:22:58,590 --> 00:22:59,852
Then l'll see you tomorrow.

292
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,891
Are you taking the first bus?

293
00:23:03,829 --> 00:23:07,390
l'll wait at the crossroads.
Tell the driver to stop.

294
00:23:08,534 --> 00:23:09,592
Come on, stay.

295
00:23:37,996 --> 00:23:38,963
ls that her?

296
00:23:40,899 --> 00:23:42,093
Half past one!

297
00:23:42,634 --> 00:23:44,602
Did you guys miss me?

298
00:23:53,946 --> 00:23:55,038
You went dancing again?

299
00:23:55,581 --> 00:23:56,548
Until now?

300
00:23:56,882 --> 00:23:59,316
Tell me something...

301
00:23:59,451 --> 00:24:01,351
l do have something
to tell you in fact.

302
00:24:01,653 --> 00:24:04,019
l promised you a surprise.
Well, here it is.

303
00:24:05,591 --> 00:24:07,525
l am writing to the Welfare
Board reporting your behavior

304
00:24:07,659 --> 00:24:09,627
and am asking they take you
back at St. Mary's.

305
00:24:09,828 --> 00:24:11,056
You're going back to the
orphanage

306
00:24:11,463 --> 00:24:13,693
and you'll stay
until you're 21 .

307
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:17,266
That's all you have to say
for yourself. Heartless girl.

308
00:24:18,036 --> 00:24:19,594
l've had enough
of this menagerie.

309
00:24:19,738 --> 00:24:20,796
My house isn't a circus.

310
00:24:21,073 --> 00:24:22,836
Tomorrow that rabbit
will be stew.

311
00:24:23,909 --> 00:24:25,308
Well, we'll see.

312
00:24:32,985 --> 00:24:35,818
You're staying here.
Goodbye.

313
00:25:13,625 --> 00:25:14,683
Stop it.

314
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:25,260
Fly away...and watch out
for cats.

315
00:25:26,505 --> 00:25:27,904
You too...go on.

316
00:25:28,774 --> 00:25:32,767
Cities aren't for rabbits,
my poor Socrates. Run!

317
00:25:39,918 --> 00:25:43,012
Look, it's Juliette.
What's she doing out so early?

318
00:26:00,639 --> 00:26:01,970
Come back, l'm not leaving.

319
00:26:04,309 --> 00:26:06,334
Socrates, come back here.

320
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:13,277
What a dumb rabbit!

321
00:26:36,708 --> 00:26:38,039
She's been snooping around town
for three days.

322
00:26:38,343 --> 00:26:40,777
She asked me about you
this morning. l told her off.

323
00:26:41,013 --> 00:26:42,480
l wonder what she's after?

324
00:26:42,714 --> 00:26:44,841
l have an idea. You want to know
what it is?

325
00:26:46,551 --> 00:26:48,985
l understood when she asked me
about...

326
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,931
l'd like ''Home and Hearth''

327
00:27:03,902 --> 00:27:05,301
Just there, behind you.

328
00:27:20,919 --> 00:27:22,284
You gave me 1 0 francs too much.

329
00:27:26,591 --> 00:27:31,028
Shameless, impolite,
and also lazy.

330
00:27:32,898 --> 00:27:33,887
l was hoping to find excuses
for you,

331
00:27:34,066 --> 00:27:35,431
but l help but agree
with Mrs. Morin.

332
00:27:35,834 --> 00:27:37,995
-Excuses for what?
-Your behavior.

333
00:27:38,537 --> 00:27:40,027
-ls it your business?
-Absolutely.

334
00:27:40,339 --> 00:27:42,534
l've been put on your case
by the Welfare Board.

335
00:27:42,941 --> 00:27:46,001
l'll tell them that you're
a disgrace to the orphenage.

336
00:27:46,545 --> 00:27:48,672
l can't deny any of the rumors
l've heard.

337
00:27:50,449 --> 00:27:53,350
My child, l think there's only
one way to save yourself.

338
00:27:54,052 --> 00:27:57,317
Go see a doctor and have him
give you a certificate.

339
00:27:58,056 --> 00:27:59,455
What kind of certificate?

340
00:27:59,725 --> 00:28:02,819
lf you're a proper young lady,
l'll give you another chance.

341
00:28:05,397 --> 00:28:07,024
l didn't know love was
a disease.

342
00:28:09,001 --> 00:28:11,993
Anyway, you're not at risk.
You've had your vaccine.

343
00:28:15,574 --> 00:28:16,939
Your magazine. lt's paid for.

344
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:28,952
What do you want?

345
00:28:29,521 --> 00:28:30,954
''Le Provencal.''

346
00:28:33,325 --> 00:28:35,293
l want to get it myself.

347
00:28:39,798 --> 00:28:44,531
l'll give it to you, but first
give me a big kiss.

348
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:58,439
We can come in as close
to the shore as 50 strokes.

349
00:28:58,717 --> 00:29:00,651
Good. Have them stop the engine
in the middle of the bay.

350
00:29:01,286 --> 00:29:02,378
You studied law, didn't you?

351
00:29:03,622 --> 00:29:06,523
Suppose you're right and
they send the girl

352
00:29:06,658 --> 00:29:07,784
back to the orphanage..

353
00:29:07,959 --> 00:29:09,221
l can find out.

354
00:29:09,761 --> 00:29:10,819
How can we avoid this?

355
00:29:10,962 --> 00:29:13,522
lt's not easy. You can't really
buy them off.

356
00:29:13,665 --> 00:29:14,825
l mean legally.

357
00:29:14,966 --> 00:29:16,524
There's marriage or adoption.

358
00:29:16,968 --> 00:29:19,801
But that means a very close
investigation, police records,

359
00:29:20,439 --> 00:29:21,599
-integrity...
-l see.

360
00:29:21,773 --> 00:29:24,003
ln business, you use a dummy
and lay low.

361
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:28,841
Why not? All l care in the end
is that she stays here.

362
00:29:29,047 --> 00:29:30,275
Within your reach?

363
00:29:31,483 --> 00:29:32,643
There's that shipyard.

364
00:29:34,352 --> 00:29:37,651
l'm going to try again.
When is that moron coming back?

365
00:29:37,789 --> 00:29:39,313
Probably Sunday. lt's Easter.

366
00:29:57,442 --> 00:29:58,534
Did you speak to the Tardieus?

367
00:30:01,813 --> 00:30:03,781
There they are. lt'll be easier.

368
00:30:12,858 --> 00:30:14,587
l'm getting off. Wait for me
down the road.

369
00:30:16,962 --> 00:30:19,362
l saw your car yesterday.
lt's a Lancia, right?

370
00:30:19,564 --> 00:30:20,531
What will she do?

371
00:30:20,665 --> 00:30:23,065
220 km/hr. l'll let you try it.

372
00:30:23,435 --> 00:30:24,094
No kidding.

373
00:30:24,736 --> 00:30:25,998
Have you changed your mind yet?

374
00:30:26,638 --> 00:30:27,536
l'm stubborn.

375
00:30:27,672 --> 00:30:29,401
So am l. l'll raise my offer
by a million.

376
00:30:29,708 --> 00:30:30,902
There must be oil on that land.

377
00:30:31,042 --> 00:30:32,304
So what?

378
00:30:32,711 --> 00:30:34,838
lf l sold, my father would
turn over in his grave.

379
00:30:35,413 --> 00:30:37,711
Strange town. Nobody here
wants my money.

380
00:30:40,685 --> 00:30:42,050
Do you know what l just
found out?

381
00:30:42,721 --> 00:30:44,621
The Morins are sending Juliette
back to the orphanage.

382
00:30:44,789 --> 00:30:45,721
Does that make you happy?

383
00:30:45,857 --> 00:30:47,085
l wouldn't have waited a year.

384
00:30:49,594 --> 00:30:50,822
She's a kid.
She likes to play games.

385
00:30:51,329 --> 00:30:52,626
She likes to play house.

386
00:30:52,931 --> 00:30:54,626
She needs affection.

387
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:57,734
She needs someone to understand
and to guide her.

388
00:30:58,370 --> 00:30:59,667
She's leaving anyway.

389
00:30:59,971 --> 00:31:01,438
We can stop it.

390
00:31:01,573 --> 00:31:03,666
That wouldn't do anyone
any good.

391
00:31:04,476 --> 00:31:09,436
You say we can prevent her from
going back to the orphanage?

392
00:31:10,749 --> 00:31:11,681
How?

393
00:31:11,983 --> 00:31:15,419
We'd need a man to sacrifice his
freedom so she can keep hers.

394
00:31:16,588 --> 00:31:17,452
Marry her?

395
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:19,584
Marry Juliette?

396
00:31:19,724 --> 00:31:21,624
The poor guy would never get
a hat on over his horns.

397
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:24,021
She won't find a husband here,
believe me.

398
00:31:24,429 --> 00:31:25,453
How do you know?

399
00:31:34,839 --> 00:31:36,932
l'd like the Daily Herald.

400
00:31:37,342 --> 00:31:38,604
We only get it in the summer.

401
00:31:38,843 --> 00:31:40,470
No problem. l'll come back.

402
00:31:50,755 --> 00:31:52,347
lt's noon...l'm locking up.

403
00:31:57,629 --> 00:31:58,823
So you leave tomorrow.

404
00:32:01,399 --> 00:32:02,331
Are you sad?

405
00:32:17,816 --> 00:32:20,410
lf you found another job,
could you stay?

406
00:32:21,686 --> 00:32:22,778
Nothing can be done.

407
00:32:24,556 --> 00:32:25,716
Are you going home?

408
00:32:25,957 --> 00:32:27,822
No, l'm going to eat
on the jetty.

409
00:32:53,718 --> 00:32:55,015
What if you got married?

410
00:32:55,353 --> 00:32:56,479
Who would want me?

411
00:32:59,624 --> 00:33:00,955
Wouldn't you be a good wife?

412
00:33:01,726 --> 00:33:03,318
l like to have fun too much.

413
00:33:04,796 --> 00:33:06,730
Anyone as pretty as you would.

414
00:33:07,299 --> 00:33:10,530
l don't know. lt's always as if
l'm going to die tomorrow...

415
00:33:11,436 --> 00:33:14,530
Something inside me pushes me
to do silly things.

416
00:33:15,807 --> 00:33:18,742
What if you were in love?
Would that make a difference?

417
00:33:21,913 --> 00:33:23,039
Maybe....

418
00:33:25,083 --> 00:33:26,948
l've never spoken about myself
so much.

419
00:33:43,702 --> 00:33:44,760
Would you be my wife?

420
00:33:49,841 --> 00:33:51,775
l'm sure l could make you happy.

421
00:33:52,444 --> 00:33:53,570
No, we can't.

422
00:33:55,413 --> 00:33:56,675
What are you afraid of?

423
00:33:58,016 --> 00:33:59,483
Of myself.

424
00:33:59,951 --> 00:34:02,511
You're no worse than
anyone else. On the contrary...

425
00:34:03,621 --> 00:34:04,747
You don't know me.

426
00:34:08,626 --> 00:34:09,991
l don't want you to go back
to that place.

427
00:34:10,595 --> 00:34:11,892
Neither do l, Michel.

428
00:34:12,564 --> 00:34:14,828
l hate to think about it;
l know it'll be awful.

429
00:34:19,371 --> 00:34:21,305
l want so much for you
to be my wife.

430
00:34:28,513 --> 00:34:31,346
Can you imagine your mother's
face when you tell her?

431
00:34:34,619 --> 00:34:37,383
Never! She'll never be a part
of this family.

432
00:34:38,390 --> 00:34:40,324
l'm 21 . You can't stop me.

433
00:34:40,625 --> 00:34:43,890
Never! Do you hear me? Never!

434
00:34:44,329 --> 00:34:45,887
lt's boiling over...

435
00:34:48,466 --> 00:34:51,663
Take her if you want to...
but don't say l didn't warn you.

436
00:34:57,375 --> 00:34:59,366
You're really getting married?
To whom?

437
00:34:59,511 --> 00:35:00,603
Juliette.

438
00:35:10,889 --> 00:35:14,325
l beg you, Michel,
think this over carefully.

439
00:35:14,692 --> 00:35:19,061
That girl is like a wild animal.
She needs to be tamed.

440
00:35:19,998 --> 00:35:21,431
You're not a man yet.

441
00:35:23,968 --> 00:35:24,832
Ah, there you are!

442
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:26,931
lf Jeanne made up her mind
about buying that motor,

443
00:35:27,071 --> 00:35:28,504
we wouldn't always be late.

444
00:35:38,049 --> 00:35:38,981
Excuse us.

445
00:35:39,284 --> 00:35:40,808
Don't worry. Antoine
isn't even here yet.

446
00:35:40,985 --> 00:35:42,475
l thought he came in yesterday.

447
00:35:42,787 --> 00:35:44,687
His boss needed him at work.

448
00:35:49,427 --> 00:35:51,395
He wasn't at the town hall.
He won't come.

449
00:35:52,096 --> 00:35:54,621
We three have always
stuck together.

450
00:35:55,366 --> 00:35:56,492
He won't come.

451
00:36:00,772 --> 00:36:02,034
He was at the bus stop.
He's coming.

452
00:36:28,833 --> 00:36:33,429
Michel Tardieu, do you take
as your lawful wedded wife

453
00:36:33,771 --> 00:36:35,568
Juliette Christiane Hardy

454
00:36:35,707 --> 00:36:39,268
in accordance with the rites
of our Holy Church?

455
00:36:41,913 --> 00:36:45,781
Juliette Hardy, do you take
as your lawful wedded husband

456
00:36:45,917 --> 00:36:49,045
Michel Tardieu in accordance

457
00:36:49,387 --> 00:36:51,378
with the rites
of our Holy Church?

458
00:37:03,434 --> 00:37:05,265
Please join your right hands.

459
00:37:16,381 --> 00:37:18,349
You could have at least
stayed for dinner.

460
00:37:18,483 --> 00:37:20,474
l have to be at work at 8AM
tomorrow.

461
00:37:20,852 --> 00:37:23,320
Well, good luck kid.

462
00:37:32,664 --> 00:37:33,688
Are you angry with him?

463
00:37:33,898 --> 00:37:35,422
l hate him.

464
00:37:38,002 --> 00:37:40,402
At least you're not telling me
you're still in love with him.

465
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:53,976
Look, it's Juliette.

466
00:37:59,791 --> 00:38:01,850
Do the newlyweds want a drink?

467
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:03,449
Not tonight.

468
00:38:04,729 --> 00:38:06,822
Why didn't you invite us
to the wedding? Are you jealous?

469
00:38:07,999 --> 00:38:09,796
You better get used to sharing.

470
00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:15,497
The husband's wearing horns...

471
00:38:16,708 --> 00:38:17,402
Come on.

472
00:39:00,018 --> 00:39:03,419
Stop it. You'll kill him.
Are you crazy?

473
00:39:08,726 --> 00:39:10,660
l didn't know you were so brave.

474
00:39:13,731 --> 00:39:15,426
He's crazy to fight Rene.

475
00:39:18,636 --> 00:39:19,660
Can you walk?

476
00:39:35,019 --> 00:39:36,850
As soon as they're back,
we'll start eating.

477
00:39:37,388 --> 00:39:38,685
l think we're having chicken.

478
00:39:40,625 --> 00:39:41,523
Here they are!

479
00:39:43,895 --> 00:39:46,489
Michel! What happened?

480
00:39:46,731 --> 00:39:47,356
Nothing.

481
00:39:47,532 --> 00:39:48,396
He got into a fight.

482
00:39:48,533 --> 00:39:49,500
Michel in a fight?

483
00:39:50,268 --> 00:39:52,600
-We have to call a doctor.
-No.

484
00:39:52,737 --> 00:39:54,295
Start eating.
l'll take care of him.

485
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:57,471
Leave us alone, Mom.
Take care of the guests.

486
00:39:58,810 --> 00:40:00,300
He must have taken some beating.

487
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:02,671
l'm sure it's her fault.

488
00:40:03,047 --> 00:40:04,514
They're off to a good start.

489
00:40:28,372 --> 00:40:29,930
You're very handsome.
You know that?

490
00:41:26,831 --> 00:41:28,355
This is the first wedding party
l've attended

491
00:41:28,499 --> 00:41:29,659
without the newlyweds.

492
00:41:30,401 --> 00:41:31,959
Go see if your brother
needs anything.

493
00:41:32,303 --> 00:41:33,429
The door's locked.

494
00:41:33,771 --> 00:41:35,534
Try to get me a thigh.

495
00:41:38,609 --> 00:41:39,940
Do you think you'll be able
to love me?

496
00:41:40,077 --> 00:41:41,704
l love this.

497
00:41:43,881 --> 00:41:46,406
Do l have to cross the dining
room to go into the kitchen?

498
00:41:46,918 --> 00:41:49,580
Yes. Are you hungry?

499
00:42:27,558 --> 00:42:28,855
How is he?

500
00:42:29,293 --> 00:42:30,555
All right.

501
00:42:57,955 --> 00:42:59,388
Does he need anything?

502
00:42:59,590 --> 00:43:00,614
l'm taking care of him.

503
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:02,691
Good night.

504
00:43:23,881 --> 00:43:25,974
You're an early bird.

505
00:43:26,484 --> 00:43:28,748
l hear you're leaving us.
Going back to St. Tropez?

506
00:43:29,654 --> 00:43:30,643
That's right.

507
00:43:31,389 --> 00:43:32,856
What attracts you to that place?

508
00:43:33,691 --> 00:43:36,091
Your protege is married
from what l hear.

509
00:43:36,527 --> 00:43:39,052
You know l've got nothing
against married women.

510
00:43:39,897 --> 00:43:41,922
Eric, you're so cynical.

511
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:58,007
We never see you anymore.
Are you hiding?

512
00:43:58,582 --> 00:44:00,277
Set the table.
The boys are coming.

513
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:04,283
l used to flirt with Rene
to that tune.

514
00:44:05,523 --> 00:44:06,751
We're through, you know.

515
00:44:07,024 --> 00:44:07,956
Good.

516
00:44:08,793 --> 00:44:10,522
Listen to this. lt's terrific.

517
00:44:15,333 --> 00:44:18,734
You know, Eric's back.
His secretary has a crush on me.

518
00:44:19,870 --> 00:44:23,670
He wants to take me dancing
tonight. Eric's invited you.

519
00:44:24,642 --> 00:44:26,439
We can all go in his car.

520
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:29,910
You're stupid. Marriage
is not a convent.

521
00:44:30,781 --> 00:44:31,839
We're not deaf.

522
00:44:34,352 --> 00:44:35,512
Don't you like to go out
anymore?

523
00:44:36,354 --> 00:44:37,651
l'm dying to.

524
00:44:37,788 --> 00:44:38,812
l don't understand you.

525
00:44:39,824 --> 00:44:41,519
l'd like to make Michel happy.

526
00:44:41,926 --> 00:44:43,518
Come on, just tonight.

527
00:44:44,395 --> 00:44:45,987
lf l start, l won't be
able to stop.

528
00:44:46,964 --> 00:44:48,693
Listen, it's Gilbert Becaud.

529
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:50,465
Then what should l tell Eric?

530
00:44:51,669 --> 00:44:54,536
Tell him l don't like apples
anymore. He'll understand.

531
00:45:04,949 --> 00:45:06,780
Here you go Socrates.
l thought of you.

532
00:45:06,917 --> 00:45:07,906
What about me?

533
00:45:18,295 --> 00:45:18,989
A whiskey.

534
00:45:25,069 --> 00:45:26,798
Get me a Tellier at
the Ministry.

535
00:45:28,272 --> 00:45:29,933
The ministry agrees
in principle,

536
00:45:30,274 --> 00:45:31,639
but we have to move fast.

537
00:45:33,611 --> 00:45:35,704
Hello... Give me
Paris Littre 1 2-34.

538
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:38,480
We lose our option on
the commune's land in 3 days.

539
00:45:38,749 --> 00:45:42,742
l know. The trouble is news
of our plan are leaking out.

540
00:45:42,987 --> 00:45:43,954
You didn't talk, did you?

541
00:45:44,088 --> 00:45:45,316
l'd cut my tongue off first.

542
00:45:45,456 --> 00:45:46,548
At least we would be safe.

543
00:45:46,724 --> 00:45:50,626
All because 3 idiots refuse
to give up 50 yards of land.

544
00:45:51,862 --> 00:45:52,692
Come in.

545
00:45:57,068 --> 00:45:58,535
l told you to bring me the girl.

546
00:45:58,803 --> 00:45:59,792
She didn't want to come.

547
00:46:00,971 --> 00:46:02,268
You're a jackass.

548
00:46:02,773 --> 00:46:04,434
lf you're looking for Juliette,

549
00:46:04,608 --> 00:46:06,007
she comes in here
every afternoon.

550
00:46:06,610 --> 00:46:08,407
She plays songs on the jukebox.

551
00:46:09,647 --> 00:46:11,046
There's a useful kid.

552
00:46:17,555 --> 00:46:18,749
Give me 1 00 francs.

553
00:46:19,356 --> 00:46:20,550
l don't have anything on me.

554
00:46:23,694 --> 00:46:26,686
Mom!
Give Juliette 1 00 francs.

555
00:46:29,934 --> 00:46:31,060
l'm not a money tree.

556
00:46:31,602 --> 00:46:32,660
l'll give it back.

557
00:46:33,070 --> 00:46:34,367
This month, we're in debt.

558
00:46:35,806 --> 00:46:37,330
Of course, she doesn't care.

559
00:46:38,442 --> 00:46:39,909
We'll worry when
there's no money left.

560
00:46:40,277 --> 00:46:41,972
Why don't you work a little
for a change?

561
00:46:46,016 --> 00:46:50,453
But l do work.
l work at being happy.

562
00:46:54,391 --> 00:46:57,554
You're handsome. You
should smile all the time.

563
00:47:05,769 --> 00:47:07,703
l wonder where she goes
every day.

564
00:47:07,838 --> 00:47:09,237
You should keep an eye on her.

565
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:22,649
I hear only the sound
of your voice in the night

566
00:47:23,521 --> 00:47:30,359
Let's dance together
swaying to your words of love

567
00:47:30,895 --> 00:47:34,490
Slowly and again
and forever and ever

568
00:47:38,269 --> 00:47:45,505
Tell me something
my sweet darling

569
00:47:45,876 --> 00:47:48,436
Take me in your arms

570
00:47:48,579 --> 00:47:49,273
l'd love to.

571
00:47:49,413 --> 00:47:52,473
And smile

572
00:47:53,350 --> 00:47:56,751
I know, in this game

573
00:47:56,887 --> 00:48:00,789
You can steal my heart
and my life

574
00:48:00,958 --> 00:48:07,864
But tell me something sweet

575
00:48:24,348 --> 00:48:25,508
Are you happy?

576
00:48:25,983 --> 00:48:27,450
Of course.

577
00:48:27,651 --> 00:48:30,552
No, you aren't cut out
for this kind of life.

578
00:48:31,522 --> 00:48:33,285
l know you very well, you know.

579
00:48:33,857 --> 00:48:36,257
We're cast from the same mold,
you and l.

580
00:48:37,261 --> 00:48:39,456
You can lie...l can't.

581
00:48:39,863 --> 00:48:40,921
You'll learn.

582
00:48:43,367 --> 00:48:46,393
Let me ask you again:
Are you happy?

583
00:48:48,439 --> 00:48:49,531
l'm trying.

584
00:48:51,408 --> 00:48:52,705
Your husband is a fool.

585
00:48:53,310 --> 00:48:56,575
With a wife like you,
he should find money.

586
00:48:57,014 --> 00:48:58,003
How so?

587
00:48:58,415 --> 00:49:00,906
l'm offering it to him.
Why won't they sell?

588
00:49:02,653 --> 00:49:04,348
l am beginning
to understand them.

589
00:49:05,322 --> 00:49:08,223
As long as they own something,
they won't feel poor.

590
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:14,854
You're not stupid at all.
Of course...

591
00:49:15,399 --> 00:49:17,458
lt's Christopher Columbus' egg.

592
00:49:17,901 --> 00:49:19,926
My mistake was to
offer them money.

593
00:49:20,904 --> 00:49:25,238
l'll offer them a 30% stake
in the port's shipyard.

594
00:49:26,043 --> 00:49:27,374
We'll be rich?

595
00:49:28,679 --> 00:49:32,308
You'll live well.
Will l get my car?

596
00:49:43,794 --> 00:49:44,988
l'm still expecting a visit.

597
00:49:45,896 --> 00:49:47,420
l won't come anymore.

598
00:49:47,998 --> 00:49:50,023
Don't tell me you love
your husband.

599
00:49:52,436 --> 00:49:54,267
Have you ever seen him smile?

600
00:49:54,438 --> 00:49:55,928
You're worth more than a smile.

601
00:49:56,473 --> 00:49:58,031
Everything l love,
l've got here...

602
00:49:58,509 --> 00:50:03,310
The sea, the sun, the hot sand,
music...

603
00:50:03,714 --> 00:50:04,976
And eating.

604
00:50:06,350 --> 00:50:08,079
One day, you'll want more.

605
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:10,546
Perhaps.

606
00:50:11,388 --> 00:50:12,650
l'll wait.

607
00:50:13,924 --> 00:50:17,621
When your hair turns gray,
time is no object.

608
00:50:18,729 --> 00:50:20,424
Only the young are impatient.

609
00:50:22,766 --> 00:50:23,733
Are you angry?

610
00:50:27,471 --> 00:50:28,529
l don't like saying goodbye.

611
00:50:50,094 --> 00:50:56,932
Tell me something
my sweet darling

612
00:50:57,468 --> 00:50:59,561
Take me in your arms ...

613
00:51:00,971 --> 00:51:04,771
lt's a deal...
but on one condition

614
00:51:06,410 --> 00:51:08,878
l want to manage your shipyard.

615
00:51:12,349 --> 00:51:13,839
lt's the best way to protect
our investment.

616
00:51:14,051 --> 00:51:15,518
You won't lose out.

617
00:51:15,686 --> 00:51:18,018
l know how to manage a site
and l intend to make money.

618
00:51:18,455 --> 00:51:19,854
You'd be coming home?

619
00:51:33,303 --> 00:51:34,395
Take it or leave it.

620
00:51:35,739 --> 00:51:39,732
l accept. Let's sign
the contracts right away.

621
00:51:44,915 --> 00:51:46,439
l think it went pretty well.

622
00:51:47,718 --> 00:51:48,946
You were amazing, Antoine.

623
00:51:53,323 --> 00:51:54,483
We signed.

624
00:51:54,758 --> 00:51:58,785
We're rich, Juliette.
l can buy you anything you want.

625
00:51:59,730 --> 00:52:02,028
Antoine is coming home
to run the shipyard.

626
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:03,992
Say it isn't so.

627
00:52:04,301 --> 00:52:05,427
lt is. Everything's signed.

628
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:19,542
Antoine can't come back. l am
begging you to prevent this.

629
00:52:20,784 --> 00:52:24,049
Even if l could, it's too late.
The contracts are signed.

630
00:52:24,822 --> 00:52:28,349
l beg you, don't let him
come back.

631
00:52:30,327 --> 00:52:34,525
There's nothing l can do, kid.
ls it that serious?

632
00:52:48,679 --> 00:52:52,547
A brand new set. l'll have it
glued back together.

633
00:52:52,783 --> 00:52:54,512
Your little wife seems a bit
agitated lately.

634
00:52:55,385 --> 00:52:56,682
You should really take care
of her.

635
00:52:58,755 --> 00:53:02,316
Don't worry. He knows exactly
how to take care of me.

636
00:53:07,664 --> 00:53:09,461
At night, we're never bored.

637
00:53:16,306 --> 00:53:17,967
Hey, that's rated R.
l'm still here.

638
00:53:21,512 --> 00:53:22,809
l'm going to bed.

639
00:53:37,361 --> 00:53:38,555
Why are you waiting
to follow her up?

640
00:54:00,751 --> 00:54:01,843
Come in.

641
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:05,488
You know, the last foreman
worries me.

642
00:54:05,622 --> 00:54:07,021
The books aren't adding up.

643
00:54:07,925 --> 00:54:09,586
Are you sure? You have proof?

644
00:54:13,697 --> 00:54:15,528
We'll get up an hour early
to take inventory

645
00:54:15,666 --> 00:54:16,963
before the crew gets in.

646
00:54:17,834 --> 00:54:18,823
Good night.

647
00:54:21,071 --> 00:54:23,403
Are you done? You old maid.

648
00:54:24,808 --> 00:54:25,740
l forbid you to laugh.

649
00:54:38,322 --> 00:54:39,448
They seem to be having fun
next door.

650
00:54:41,658 --> 00:54:42,784
Your turn.

651
00:54:50,033 --> 00:54:52,433
Hey, it's your turn.

652
00:54:55,706 --> 00:54:57,674
They stopped talking.
They have better things to do.

653
00:54:57,808 --> 00:54:58,706
Shut up.

654
00:54:58,842 --> 00:55:01,811
They must have taken out
some brain matter

655
00:55:01,979 --> 00:55:02,946
to make you this tall.

656
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:05,271
Don't piss me off. You won't
enjoy what you'll get.

657
00:55:06,049 --> 00:55:08,779
They're the ones enjoying
themselves. My trick!

658
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:11,487
Juliette was made for you.

659
00:55:11,788 --> 00:55:14,018
Your brother had to marry her
to make you realize it.

660
00:55:15,058 --> 00:55:16,355
See.

661
00:55:17,761 --> 00:55:19,388
lt's a little late to be angry,
pal.

662
00:55:19,730 --> 00:55:21,698
Do what l do;
suffer with a smile.

663
00:55:21,999 --> 00:55:23,057
Get the hell out.

664
00:55:26,670 --> 00:55:28,900
Okay, but you owe me
2400 francs.

665
00:55:29,406 --> 00:55:30,430
We weren't playing for money.

666
00:55:30,674 --> 00:55:32,266
Now that you've lost,
you say that.

667
00:55:32,876 --> 00:55:34,571
Fine. Now go away. l've seen
enough of you.

668
00:55:34,778 --> 00:55:36,006
2400. Don't forget.

669
00:56:54,958 --> 00:56:56,289
Aren't you happy?

670
00:56:57,627 --> 00:56:59,390
Someone asked me that already.

671
00:57:02,432 --> 00:57:03,831
lf you've had enough,
just tell me.

672
00:57:05,469 --> 00:57:07,266
l was beginning to love you.

673
00:57:08,271 --> 00:57:09,704
So what happened?

674
00:57:10,006 --> 00:57:11,405
l'm scared.

675
00:57:17,347 --> 00:57:18,939
You're just a little kitten.

676
00:57:22,786 --> 00:57:24,481
You have to love me very much.

677
00:57:26,623 --> 00:57:28,284
l'm crazy about you.

678
00:57:28,658 --> 00:57:29,784
Then tell me.

679
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:33,295
Tell me you love me, that
l'm yours, that you need me.

680
00:57:33,930 --> 00:57:35,898
Kiss me, Michel.

681
00:57:51,047 --> 00:57:52,036
l'm scared.

682
00:57:52,649 --> 00:57:53,843
Of what?

683
00:57:54,718 --> 00:57:56,549
lt's difficult being happy.

684
00:58:15,939 --> 00:58:17,566
Everything okay?

685
00:58:17,808 --> 00:58:18,900
Just fine, sir.

686
00:58:19,042 --> 00:58:20,873
l have to go away for a while.

687
00:58:21,244 --> 00:58:22,336
Have a good trip.

688
00:59:08,625 --> 00:59:09,649
Are you crazy?

689
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:11,293
l'm shooting bottles.

690
00:59:11,628 --> 00:59:12,925
Where did you find this gun?

691
00:59:13,230 --> 00:59:16,222
ln the drawer. l love to shoot.
lt's exciting.

692
00:59:16,833 --> 00:59:17,857
l was down there.

693
00:59:18,235 --> 00:59:18,929
l didn't see you.

694
00:59:19,236 --> 00:59:20,396
You didn't miss me by much.

695
00:59:20,737 --> 00:59:22,796
lt's not funny.
l said that's enough.

696
00:59:23,907 --> 00:59:26,899
lt's fine to play the wild
child, but you're going too far.

697
00:59:27,944 --> 00:59:29,878
lf l were your husband
or your father,

698
00:59:30,013 --> 00:59:31,844
l'd give you a good spanking.

699
00:59:32,315 --> 00:59:33,282
Go ahead.

700
00:59:33,650 --> 00:59:35,311
Enough!

701
00:59:40,290 --> 00:59:41,257
What's going on?

702
00:59:41,625 --> 00:59:43,855
Your sister-in-law
thought it was a good idea

703
00:59:44,060 --> 00:59:45,755
to have target practice
on those bottles.

704
00:59:46,563 --> 00:59:47,757
You could have injured someone.

705
00:59:48,732 --> 00:59:50,927
All right, back to work...
You too.

706
00:59:51,368 --> 00:59:52,392
What are you doing here?

707
00:59:52,602 --> 00:59:54,433
l came to get you.
lt's 6 o'clock.

708
00:59:54,571 --> 00:59:54,969
Already?

709
00:59:55,272 --> 00:59:56,569
Go, but please
take her with you.

710
01:00:01,811 --> 01:00:04,075
How long do you think
this marriage will last?

711
01:00:04,514 --> 01:00:05,446
Are you interested
in our profits

712
01:00:05,582 --> 01:00:06,981
or in our family squabbles?

713
01:00:08,518 --> 01:00:09,576
Both.

714
01:00:10,487 --> 01:00:12,011
-Does she cry?
-Of course not.

715
01:00:13,757 --> 01:00:15,452
Maybe she does when
she's alone.

716
01:00:15,792 --> 01:00:17,020
She's too much of a bitch
for that.

717
01:00:19,095 --> 01:00:22,030
When it comes to female
psychology, my poor boy,

718
01:00:22,999 --> 01:00:24,830
you're stuck in the Stone Age.

719
01:00:31,675 --> 01:00:33,336
They're gonna bawl me out.

720
01:00:36,413 --> 01:00:37,437
Give me an orange.

721
01:01:54,557 --> 01:01:55,819
What are you doing here?

722
01:02:07,303 --> 01:02:08,292
Get out.

723
01:02:36,032 --> 01:02:37,363
Finally.

724
01:02:44,007 --> 01:02:45,099
Move over.

725
01:02:58,755 --> 01:03:00,313
Too bad l have no one to call.

726
01:03:00,924 --> 01:03:02,687
You'll have to see LeFaur
for the paint.

727
01:03:03,460 --> 01:03:04,757
l also have to see the lawyer.

728
01:03:04,894 --> 01:03:06,521
l won't be able to do everything
in one day.

729
01:03:06,696 --> 01:03:07,856
Are you going to Marseilles?

730
01:03:08,031 --> 01:03:09,430
Yes, for the day.

731
01:03:09,666 --> 01:03:10,894
l'm going with you.

732
01:03:11,034 --> 01:03:13,002
l'll be running all day.
You'll be bored.

733
01:03:14,437 --> 01:03:16,302
You have to get up at 6 o'clock.
l'm taking the first bus.

734
01:03:16,673 --> 01:03:17,605
l don't mind.

735
01:03:17,740 --> 01:03:21,699
Take this to the bank tomorrow...
it's starting to come in.

736
01:03:22,679 --> 01:03:24,647
-Who cares about money?
-Leave that alone.

737
01:03:34,858 --> 01:03:35,847
There's no one there.

738
01:03:38,895 --> 01:03:40,021
They must be deaf.

739
01:03:40,630 --> 01:03:41,927
lt's probably a wrong number,

740
01:03:42,365 --> 01:03:45,095
since we've only had the phone
since this morning.

741
01:04:11,661 --> 01:04:13,629
Carradine, you are
the incarnation of luck.

742
01:04:13,830 --> 01:04:14,990
You think, your Highness?

743
01:04:15,398 --> 01:04:17,923
You have money, power, women...

744
01:04:18,935 --> 01:04:19,663
Tell me.

745
01:04:19,802 --> 01:04:21,770
What does one have to do
to have a woman?

746
01:04:22,405 --> 01:04:23,633
You're asking me?

747
01:04:23,973 --> 01:04:25,463
1 ,800,000 francs.

748
01:04:25,608 --> 01:04:26,438
With the house?

749
01:04:26,609 --> 01:04:27,541
With the house.

750
01:04:27,677 --> 01:04:28,974
Banco only.

751
01:04:29,512 --> 01:04:32,413
lt depends on the woman.
Usually it takes jewels, furs...

752
01:04:32,682 --> 01:04:34,980
ln extreme cases,
a little mansion.

753
01:04:36,319 --> 01:04:38,549
Let's say you're passionately
in love with a woman.

754
01:04:38,821 --> 01:04:40,618
One night she comes
to see you...

755
01:04:41,291 --> 01:04:44,727
lnstead of having her, you see
someone else marries her.

756
01:04:45,728 --> 01:04:46,922
You call that luck?

757
01:04:47,330 --> 01:04:48,888
No, l call it good judgement.

758
01:04:49,432 --> 01:04:50,399
Perhaps.

759
01:05:02,045 --> 01:05:03,774
The bus leaves in half-an-hour.

760
01:05:05,882 --> 01:05:07,315
l'm sleepy.

761
01:05:08,451 --> 01:05:09,475
You not coming?

762
01:05:10,420 --> 01:05:11,887
l am.

763
01:05:20,296 --> 01:05:21,285
See you tomorrow.

764
01:05:34,911 --> 01:05:35,935
So how's everything?

765
01:05:36,279 --> 01:05:36,973
Good.

766
01:05:37,313 --> 01:05:39,577
Tomorrow, we'll have
the oxygen tanks.

767
01:05:40,350 --> 01:05:41,612
Where's the small boat?

768
01:05:41,751 --> 01:05:42,649
l don't know.

769
01:05:42,885 --> 01:05:44,580
Where's the small boat?

770
01:05:44,821 --> 01:05:45,913
Juliette took it.

771
01:05:46,089 --> 01:05:48,353
-Are you out of your mind?
-No. Why?

772
01:05:48,491 --> 01:05:50,288
The engine's faulty.
Where did she go?

773
01:05:50,493 --> 01:05:51,721
Toward the Camarat lighthouse.

774
01:06:34,737 --> 01:06:38,002
Stupid boat.

775
01:06:54,857 --> 01:06:57,690
Damn thing. Great boat
you got here.

776
01:07:27,623 --> 01:07:28,647
l have to take the boat back.

777
01:07:29,525 --> 01:07:31,322
Don't leave me.

778
01:07:54,283 --> 01:07:55,750
Don't leave me.

779
01:08:59,682 --> 01:09:01,309
Will you get up, you wet slob.

780
01:09:02,452 --> 01:09:03,783
Do you want me to carry you?

781
01:10:35,444 --> 01:10:36,741
Are you going to spend
the night here?

782
01:10:51,928 --> 01:10:53,020
What do you want?

783
01:10:54,664 --> 01:10:55,824
You're feverish!

784
01:10:56,098 --> 01:10:57,326
l think so.

785
01:10:58,034 --> 01:11:00,298
l'm always scared
when l have a fever.

786
01:11:01,904 --> 01:11:03,269
Stay with me.

787
01:11:04,073 --> 01:11:06,439
When l'm asleep, you can go.

788
01:11:07,710 --> 01:11:08,699
Don't worry.

789
01:11:10,746 --> 01:11:12,270
l'm miserable.

790
01:11:17,653 --> 01:11:18,847
Stop drinking.

791
01:11:25,528 --> 01:11:27,519
What's he doing up in her room?

792
01:11:49,518 --> 01:11:51,418
l understand everything now.

793
01:11:53,089 --> 01:11:55,057
You're in love with him.
lt was bound to happen.

794
01:11:55,424 --> 01:11:56,584
l don't love him.

795
01:11:57,793 --> 01:11:59,090
lt's like a disease.

796
01:12:00,062 --> 01:12:01,427
l was going to be happy
with Michel

797
01:12:01,564 --> 01:12:03,691
and now everything's ruined.

798
01:12:04,333 --> 01:12:06,267
You'll forget.

799
01:12:07,003 --> 01:12:09,437
lf only l could lie
like the others...

800
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:11,766
You'll forget.

801
01:12:13,542 --> 01:12:15,806
Both in the same day.
You could have waited.

802
01:12:16,278 --> 01:12:17,006
Bastard!

803
01:12:18,547 --> 01:12:19,878
You have no business here.

804
01:12:20,349 --> 01:12:22,283
l'm going to take judo lessons.
l'll teach you!

805
01:12:23,052 --> 01:12:24,485
Anyway, she got what she wanted.

806
01:12:27,390 --> 01:12:28,948
Maybe l wanted a friend.

807
01:12:45,708 --> 01:12:47,471
You're not a kid anymore.

808
01:12:48,978 --> 01:12:50,707
l'll make you some coffee.

809
01:13:02,792 --> 01:13:04,419
You're working already?

810
01:13:05,695 --> 01:13:07,322
l thought l'd find you
all asleep.

811
01:13:08,531 --> 01:13:10,396
I saw the lawyer last night
after dinner,

812
01:13:10,866 --> 01:13:11,992
so I took the first bus.

813
01:13:13,335 --> 01:13:15,360
I don't want to go see Juliette.
She must be asleep.

814
01:13:15,805 --> 01:13:16,863
l brought this for Mom.

815
01:13:17,006 --> 01:13:18,871
lt's just what she wanted
for her bedroom.

816
01:13:21,644 --> 01:13:22,474
Where are you going?

817
01:13:22,611 --> 01:13:23,600
To the yard.

818
01:13:23,746 --> 01:13:24,735
lt's way too early.

819
01:13:28,384 --> 01:13:29,874
What's wrong with Antoine today?

820
01:13:33,289 --> 01:13:35,484
l have to talk to you.

821
01:13:36,525 --> 01:13:37,457
About what?

822
01:13:40,996 --> 01:13:43,089
Your wife, my poor boy.

823
01:13:43,799 --> 01:13:45,289
What's wrong with her?

824
01:13:45,501 --> 01:13:47,526
She's fine. Come in...

825
01:14:02,051 --> 01:14:05,020
lt's best you know before
you make a fool of yourself.

826
01:14:06,489 --> 01:14:09,856
Your brother...she's off
to a good start.

827
01:14:12,962 --> 01:14:14,395
What should we do?

828
01:14:14,864 --> 01:14:16,354
You have to tell her to leave.

829
01:14:17,433 --> 01:14:21,267
lf she makes a fuss,
tell her we'll provide for her.

830
01:14:21,771 --> 01:14:23,830
But she has to leave now,
this morning.

831
01:14:32,848 --> 01:14:35,817
Here, l brought this
for you.

832
01:14:43,659 --> 01:14:45,024
l warned you.

833
01:15:25,367 --> 01:15:26,026
Where are you going?

834
01:15:26,335 --> 01:15:26,858
To find Juliette.

835
01:15:27,002 --> 01:15:29,527
Don't! Please...
she'll be the end of you.

836
01:16:05,407 --> 01:16:07,398
lsn't that the Esmeralda
coming in?

837
01:16:10,279 --> 01:16:11,746
That's Carradine's boat.

838
01:16:45,281 --> 01:16:46,646
You're lucky l stopped.

839
01:16:47,349 --> 01:16:48,043
Are you hurt?

840
01:16:49,985 --> 01:16:51,009
My goodness, she's smashed.

841
01:16:51,387 --> 01:16:52,354
This early?

842
01:16:58,761 --> 01:17:00,285
A brandy...double.

843
01:17:01,864 --> 01:17:03,024
Have you seen Lucienne?

844
01:17:03,365 --> 01:17:04,354
Not yet, no.

845
01:17:06,235 --> 01:17:07,930
She should be here shortly.
l'm supposed to meet her.

846
01:17:27,623 --> 01:17:28,681
Oh, it's awful!

847
01:17:31,026 --> 01:17:32,323
Another one...a double.

848
01:17:36,699 --> 01:17:40,032
Juliette almost had an accident.
She looked weird.

849
01:17:41,670 --> 01:17:42,864
She went into the
''Bar des Amis.''

850
01:17:43,639 --> 01:17:46,073
lt's none of my business, but
you shouldn't let her go there.

851
01:17:46,375 --> 01:17:47,933
What are you doing here?
You should be at work.

852
01:17:50,679 --> 01:17:51,941
Wait for me.
l'll be right there.

853
01:17:54,350 --> 01:17:55,009
What's the matter?

854
01:17:58,053 --> 01:17:59,315
l don't know.

855
01:18:00,322 --> 01:18:01,550
Did something happen?

856
01:18:03,859 --> 01:18:07,488
Am l crazy?
lt must be the fever.

857
01:18:08,697 --> 01:18:10,756
lt's stupid to go swimming
this time of year.

858
01:18:16,972 --> 01:18:19,941
Dying should be as easy
as swallowing this.

859
01:18:23,579 --> 01:18:25,012
l've got such a hangover.

860
01:18:27,016 --> 01:18:28,347
Have you seen Juliette?

861
01:18:29,918 --> 01:18:31,317
l've looked everywhere.

862
01:18:32,755 --> 01:18:34,450
There's a bar where
the whores go.

863
01:18:34,590 --> 01:18:35,852
You can find her there.

864
01:18:36,291 --> 01:18:37,019
Where?

865
01:18:37,726 --> 01:18:39,751
Shit, my head is pounding.

866
01:18:40,362 --> 01:18:41,522
Where is she?

867
01:18:42,898 --> 01:18:45,458
At the ''Bar des Amis.''
Getting hammered.

868
01:18:46,602 --> 01:18:47,569
Don't go.

869
01:18:50,072 --> 01:18:51,471
Forget about that bitch.

870
01:18:59,048 --> 01:19:00,640
l won't allow you
to call her that.

871
01:19:01,283 --> 01:19:02,580
Your bitch whore.

872
01:19:04,653 --> 01:19:07,315
Why whore? Did you pay
to have her?

873
01:19:07,656 --> 01:19:10,250
Yes. She cost me a boat.
l wasn't insured.

874
01:19:12,928 --> 01:19:14,452
What's the problem?
Do l need a shave?

875
01:19:25,474 --> 01:19:26,941
You're upset with me,
aren't you?

876
01:19:28,277 --> 01:19:29,835
Well, l'm glad you know.

877
01:19:31,013 --> 01:19:32,446
Who told you?

878
01:19:33,849 --> 01:19:35,373
Mom.

879
01:19:36,885 --> 01:19:37,943
She was right to do it.

880
01:19:45,461 --> 01:19:45,950
Forget her!

881
01:19:46,562 --> 01:19:48,962
Yesterday she was screaming
in my arms.

882
01:19:49,264 --> 01:19:50,253
Tomorrow, it'll be another.

883
01:19:50,432 --> 01:19:53,663
l don't care! She's my wife.
l want her back.

884
01:19:53,936 --> 01:19:55,631
l guarantee you won't leave
this place.

885
01:20:00,809 --> 01:20:02,743
You're not going to stay there
all day.

886
01:20:02,878 --> 01:20:05,506
Why not? lt'll give me time
to think.

887
01:20:06,782 --> 01:20:07,942
You're jealous.

888
01:20:08,083 --> 01:20:11,382
You'd rather she leave
than to see her in my arms.

889
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:13,080
You're insane.

890
01:20:14,022 --> 01:20:15,046
Let me through.

891
01:20:26,969 --> 01:20:28,698
That stuff only works
in detective movies.

892
01:20:29,371 --> 01:20:30,303
Give me the key.

893
01:20:43,685 --> 01:20:44,879
Go on, give me the key.

894
01:20:53,462 --> 01:20:54,793
Will you give the damn key?

895
01:20:55,797 --> 01:20:56,855
Stop it!

896
01:21:02,704 --> 01:21:04,729
What do you think you're
gonna do? Don't be a fool!

897
01:21:15,651 --> 01:21:16,845
Enough. Cut it out.

898
01:21:47,549 --> 01:21:50,882
Christian. Antoine's hurt.
ln the shed.

899
01:21:59,061 --> 01:22:01,655
Hello...yes, it's me.

900
01:22:03,498 --> 01:22:04,362
Excuse me.

901
01:22:05,267 --> 01:22:07,030
You're always typing
when l'm on the phone.

902
01:22:08,770 --> 01:22:10,397
l'm listening.

903
01:22:10,872 --> 01:22:12,703
l'm calling like you
asked me to.

904
01:22:13,942 --> 01:22:17,469
Something happened with
her husband. l'm not sure what.

905
01:22:18,647 --> 01:22:19,477
She's acting weird...

906
01:22:32,928 --> 01:22:34,020
What's that noise?

907
01:22:34,529 --> 01:22:36,429
lt's the ''Whiskey Club'' band
rehearsing.

908
01:22:36,765 --> 01:22:38,323
They're opening up
in a few days.

909
01:24:01,650 --> 01:24:02,947
Come dance?

910
01:24:34,449 --> 01:24:35,438
What's gotten into you?

911
01:24:35,584 --> 01:24:36,915
Can't you see l'm having fun?

912
01:24:37,052 --> 01:24:38,314
Come on. That's enough.

913
01:24:39,554 --> 01:24:42,318
Do you know a place where people
just want to dance and laugh?

914
01:24:42,524 --> 01:24:43,513
l'll take you there.

915
01:24:43,992 --> 01:24:44,822
ls it far away?

916
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:46,359
Halfway across the world.

917
01:24:46,795 --> 01:24:48,592
l'd like to stop thinking
completely...

918
01:24:49,898 --> 01:24:51,490
That's why l'm here Juliette.

919
01:26:19,554 --> 01:26:20,646
l'd like to speak to you.

920
01:26:33,869 --> 01:26:35,530
l am begging you, stop!

921
01:26:50,685 --> 01:26:51,652
Stop it.

922
01:27:30,325 --> 01:27:33,055
Juliette, please.

923
01:27:56,751 --> 01:27:57,979
Don't move.

924
01:27:58,286 --> 01:28:00,550
You fool! Can't you see
she loves you.

925
01:28:22,377 --> 01:28:24,311
You're lucky. You only made
a hole in my shirt.

926
01:28:27,882 --> 01:28:28,849
What's going on?

927
01:28:30,685 --> 01:28:31,743
Come with me.

928
01:28:32,921 --> 01:28:34,513
What got into you?
Are you mad?

929
01:29:02,951 --> 01:29:04,350
l can't drive.

930
01:29:05,286 --> 01:29:06,651
l'll take you to a doctor.

931
01:29:06,988 --> 01:29:09,479
Not here.
They'd tell the police.

932
01:29:11,593 --> 01:29:14,494
And the police don't know
anything about love.

933
01:29:14,729 --> 01:29:16,594
l have a friend who's a surgeon
in Nice.

934
01:29:37,719 --> 01:29:38,845
Very clever.

935
01:29:39,320 --> 01:29:41,015
No one is clever today.
Not even you.

936
01:29:41,656 --> 01:29:42,645
Why?

937
01:29:49,931 --> 01:29:52,456
You missed your only chance
to take her away.

938
01:29:53,568 --> 01:29:54,432
l know.

939
01:29:54,769 --> 01:29:56,703
You're no good at playing
Santa Claus.

940
01:29:57,272 --> 01:29:59,433
l'd rather play Santa Claus
than a puppet.

941
01:30:00,709 --> 01:30:02,904
That girl is made to destroy men.

942
01:30:03,978 --> 01:30:04,967
Are you afraid?

943
01:30:05,447 --> 01:30:08,007
Maybe for the first time
in my life.

944
01:30:10,585 --> 01:30:13,554
Poor Michel. He played
''loser wins'' with you.

945
01:30:14,289 --> 01:30:16,621
He's young. He might recover.

946
01:30:16,991 --> 01:30:19,084
But you're leaving St. Tropez.

947
01:30:19,627 --> 01:30:20,889
l know what l have to do.

948
01:30:21,329 --> 01:30:23,729
Let me give you some advice.

949
01:30:24,099 --> 01:30:26,465
Don't ever forget that
l'm the boss.

950
01:30:26,668 --> 01:30:29,102
l've broken much stronger men
than you.

951
01:30:29,838 --> 01:30:33,433
Let's get out of here. l don't
want to die in this wreck.
