1
00:01:03,731 --> 00:01:07,400
People have always
trusted me with their secrets,

2
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:11,154
but who do I trust with mine?

3
00:01:11,447 --> 00:01:14,949
You. Only you.

4
00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:49,650
The first day of a new term.

5
00:01:52,196 --> 00:01:55,448
Here come the local pubescent proles,

6
00:01:55,574 --> 00:02:01,579
the future plumbers and shop assistants
and doubtless the odd terrorist, too.

7
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:08,795
In the old days,
we confiscated cigarettes and wank mags.

8
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:11,798
Now it's knives and crack cocaine.

9
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:16,636
And they call it progress.

10
00:02:20,724 --> 00:02:22,850
Tony.

11
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:26,062
Mrs. Hart, art department.

12
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:31,317
In 1517 Martin Luther nails his 95 points
to a church door

13
00:02:31,443 --> 00:02:35,822
in Wittenberg.

14
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:41,285
Poison granny.

15
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:48,918
Piss off, you prick.

16
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:53,673
Before we begin, for those of you
who haven't delivered your reports,

17
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:57,969
please lob them in my general direction.
Thank you, Bill. Thank you, Mary.

18
00:02:58,095 --> 00:03:01,097
Thank you, John. Thank you, Elaine.

19
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:06,269
Ah. Has everyone met our new art teacher,
Sheba Hart?

20
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:10,189
I've asked Sheba to sit in on this meeting.
As you all know,

21
00:03:10,274 --> 00:03:15,194
I regard the arts as absolutely essential
to our policy of reform through nurture.

22
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:17,864
Thank you, Chris. Very good. Very good.

23
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:21,492
Thank you, Sue.
I say, that's a big one, isn't it?

24
00:03:21,577 --> 00:03:24,704
I'll be up till the crack of dawn!

25
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:28,124
Anyone else not handed
in their homework? Right, and...

26
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,084
Thank you.

27
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:33,170
Lovely. Thank you.

28
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:35,464
Barbara?

29
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:47,685
This is your report?
On the history department?

30
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:52,440
On its entire workings and your general
thoughts for its future development?

31
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,818
You'll find it's quite thorough, Headmaster.

32
00:03:57,696 --> 00:04:02,241
"The history department functions as one
would expect for a school of this intake.

33
00:04:02,326 --> 00:04:06,662
"Examination results
have been consistent for 30 years,

34
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:10,625
"below the national average
but above the level of catastrophe."

35
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:15,129
"Recommendation, no change necessary."

36
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,843
It took me most of the summer to write it.

37
00:04:23,347 --> 00:04:25,932
Hard to read the wispy novice.

38
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:27,934
Piss off, you prick.

39
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:31,187
Is she a sphinx, or simply stupid?

40
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:34,482
All right. Off the phone, please.
Give me the phone.

41
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:37,777
Artfully dishevelled today.

42
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:40,738
The tweedy tramp coat is an abhorrence.

43
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:44,617
It seems to say, "I'm just like you."

44
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:47,453
But clearly she's not.

45
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:50,539
A fey person, I suspect.

46
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:52,500
Fey.

47
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:55,461
Come on, come on, pass it.
Yes, I'm over here!

48
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:57,421
Yeah!

49
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:05,513
- Put your shirt on.
- I got the winner.

50
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:08,391
Glory be. Shirt!

51
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:15,356
She has certainly rippled the waters
of our stagnant pond.

52
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,441
They flock to her.

53
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:23,280
Even limp little Brian had a go.
Oh, the horror.

54
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:25,908
- Hiya.
- Oh, hello.

55
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:28,744
- That's a lovely blouse.
- What? Oh!

56
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:32,164
And Fatty Hodge has pounced on her.

57
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:34,792
A dubious double act,

58
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:38,045
the blonde and the pig in knickers.

59
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:41,465
I just went past the art studio.
It's like bloody Lord of the Flies.

60
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:42,717
Have they gone for her?

61
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:45,553
Torn her posters down.
There's a paint fight.

62
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:49,932
They're chanting, "Get your tits out
for the lads." Girls, too. It's carnage.

63
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,225
How was madam?

64
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:54,270
Lost it. "Stop it,
you little fucking bastards!"

65
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:58,357
- You should have stepped in.
- He didn't want to patronise the lady.

66
00:05:58,442 --> 00:06:01,318
This time next year
she'll be headmistress.

67
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:05,364
- Oh, Christ, will you shut up?
- Sorry. Sorry.

68
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:08,367
Char, anyone? Babs?

69
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:12,663
- Milk, no sugar.
- Sweet enough?

70
00:06:12,748 --> 00:06:16,459
- Evidently.
- Didn't her father invent inflation?

71
00:06:16,752 --> 00:06:19,295
- You what?
- Wasn't her dad that academic?

72
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:24,341
Donald whatsit. Economics bloke.
Invented the word "inflation".

73
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:26,927
Oh, yeah. I know who you mean.

74
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:30,389
I think you'll find that
Mrs. Hart's father was Ronald Taylor.

75
00:06:30,474 --> 00:06:32,933
He didn't invent inflation.

76
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:36,604
He devised a theory about
the relationship between inflation

77
00:06:36,772 --> 00:06:38,689
and consumer expectation.

78
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:47,740
Davis, get off him! Stop it!

79
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:51,160
- No, you're an arsehole.
- Stop it!

80
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:59,293
- Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
- Stop it! Stop it immediately!

81
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:03,756
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

82
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,176
You're going to hurt one another!
Now, stop it!

83
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:08,469
Davis, get off him!

84
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:11,013
Enough!

85
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:13,933
Outside! Now!

86
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:27,696
- Fuck off!
- Absolute silence. Absolute!

87
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:37,915
- Why were they fighting, Mrs. Hart?
- Their motive was unclear.

88
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:41,585
Davis, I know. You're a little thug.
Who might you be?

89
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:43,420
- Steven Connolly, Miss.
- What?

90
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:45,381
- Steven Connolly, Miss.
- Year?

91
00:07:45,549 --> 00:07:48,467
- Year 10, Miss.
- You're the naked footballer.

92
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:53,222
Why were you fighting?
It's a perfectly simple question.

93
00:07:53,557 --> 00:07:55,850
- Dunno, Miss.
- You don't know.

94
00:07:56,101 --> 00:08:00,062
One minute you're inert,
the next you're trying to castrate a pupil.

95
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,022
Nothing occurred
between these two states?

96
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:03,190
No.

97
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:06,485
Don't play the hero with me, Connolly. Yes?

98
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:09,572
Brain, mouth, speak.

99
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:15,244
He was saying stuff about Miss.
It was bang out of order.

100
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:19,290
- What did you say?
- I never said nothing, Miss.

101
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:23,460
"I didn't say anything."
What did he say? Come on!

102
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:26,922
He said she's a tart.
He said he gave her one up the arse.

103
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,133
Did you, indeed?

104
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:31,760
Odious boy. Apologise at once.

105
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:35,472
- Sorry, Miss.
- Deputy head in the morning.

106
00:08:35,891 --> 00:08:37,766
Get back inside, both of you.

107
00:08:43,607 --> 00:08:47,193
Little towers of testosterone.
You'll soon get used to them.

108
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:50,446
Thank you so much.

109
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:54,533
I'd better... Oh, I'm sorry.
We haven't met properly. I'm Sheba Hart.

110
00:08:54,618 --> 00:08:56,702
Barbara Covett.

111
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:04,668
Her voice is pure,
as if her mouth were empty and clean.

112
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:07,588
As if she'd never had a filling.

113
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:10,925
The complexion of a white peach.

114
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:13,719
One can almost see her veins.

115
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:17,640
Her trendy politics
are similarly transparent.

116
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:21,227
We serve them best
if we teach them to read, write and add.

117
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:23,812
They don't need to know
about basket weavers.

118
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:26,690
- Barbara's keen on the basics.
- When you started,

119
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:29,360
didn't you want to give them
a real education

120
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:33,781
to help them overcome
the poverty of their backgrounds?

121
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:38,744
Oh, yes, of course. But one soon learns
that teaching is crowd control.

122
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:41,372
Come here.
You know you're not supposed...

123
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:46,502
We're a branch of the social services.
Put that back, you.

124
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:51,590
Console yourself with the gems.

125
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:55,094
That's when it's satisfying.
You can make a real difference.

126
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:58,681
The rest is just cattle-prod and pray.

127
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:03,185
I can see why others are beguiled by her.

128
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:05,271
Oh, hello.

129
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:09,149
I wonder if she possesses
the requisite heft?

130
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:11,652
- Do you fancy a coffee?
- Yeah.

131
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:13,779
Sheba!

132
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:16,865
- Sorry.
- That's the year 11s. They're a nightmare.

133
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,868
Do you want to join us?
We're going for a quick coffee.

134
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:25,416
- I've got a bit of an announcement.
- You're leaving St George's?

135
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,959
No.

136
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:29,878
Oh, you're pregnant.

137
00:10:33,008 --> 00:10:34,800
That's fantastic.

138
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:38,304
Oh, congratulations. When are you due?

139
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:41,432
- June 7.
- A summer baby. How lovely.

140
00:10:41,516 --> 00:10:44,601
I can't believe nobody's noticed.
I'm 14 weeks.

141
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:46,562
Didn't you see how chunky I'm getting?

142
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,981
Didn't like to say. Where are you having it?

143
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:52,818
Homerton. It's really nice there.

144
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:55,029
Lovely, friendly nurses.

145
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:58,032
I'm going to find out at the next scan.
20 weeks.

146
00:11:00,535 --> 00:11:04,955
- Do you want to come to lunch on Sunday?
- Where?

147
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,375
To mine. To our house.

148
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:12,838
- Won't you be with the family?
- Oh, yes, but you're very welcome.

149
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:17,259
It's no big deal.
I'll just do a lasagne or something.

150
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:19,470
I adore lasagne.

151
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:26,643
Bliss. A merry flag on the Arctic wilderness
of my calendar.

152
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:31,065
One must make an effort
when one receives an invitation.

153
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:36,653
The art of it is seeming not to.

154
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:45,537
Lasagne tends to disagree with my bowels.

155
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:48,207
I'll ask for a small portion.

156
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:20,322
- Oh, I think I've got the wrong house.
- No, you're bang on. I'm Richard. Come in.

157
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:22,741
I'm sorry. I thought...

158
00:12:22,826 --> 00:12:25,119
That I'd be 20 years younger
and handsome.

159
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:27,413
- Bash!
- The kitchen's on fire!

160
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:30,249
Sorry if you were there long.
The bell's knackered.

161
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,085
- Hi, Barbara.
- Hello.

162
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:38,340
Oh, what a splendid room.

163
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:41,760
What can I get you?
We're semi-pro drinkers here. You name it.

164
00:12:41,845 --> 00:12:43,929
A dry sherry, please.

165
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:48,016
I think we might have
some apricot brandy knocking around.

166
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,269
- A dry white wine?
- Done.

167
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:52,688
Have a seat.

168
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:03,282
You must be Polly. I'm Barbara.

169
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:05,617
Hi, Barbara.

170
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:13,000
- Are you going somewhere?
- Excuse me?

171
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:15,961
- You're all poshed up.
- Oh.

172
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:18,547
I have an appointment.

173
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:21,258
Later, in town.

174
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:30,642
- Have you always lived here?
- Mum inherited it. It's her little joke.

175
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:34,396
I only married her for the property.
Morning.

176
00:13:35,607 --> 00:13:37,483
- Did Pete go?
- Mm.

177
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:41,320
- He was welcome to stay.
- He's not really into lunch.

178
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:43,780
Cheers.

179
00:13:45,617 --> 00:13:48,076
Mm. Are you interested in wine?

180
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:52,247
Only the drinking part. You?

181
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:55,542
I spent the summer on the Amalfi coast...

182
00:13:55,627 --> 00:14:00,255
Here's trouble. Now, now, now,
now, now, now, easy, Rocky! Easy.

183
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:02,341
Easy, peasy, wheezy.

184
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:08,639
I'd anticipated a suave young lawyer
and two perfect poppets.

185
00:14:08,932 --> 00:14:13,268
Not so. She's married
some crumbling patriarch.

186
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:15,312
He's nearly as old as me.

187
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:19,650
And then there's the daughter,
a pocket princess,

188
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:23,111
and finally a somewhat tiresome
court jester.

189
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:26,865
Ah, lovely. Thank you.

190
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:30,702
- I'm going to be a wizard.
- Oh.

191
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:35,332
- Is that when you're grown up?
- No. He's been cast in his school play.

192
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:38,502
I'm gonna wear a cape and my wand...

193
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:43,799
Amongst next year's cultural highlights,
I greatly look forward to Benjamin Hart

194
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:48,512
in the key role of "The Wizard", and I find
myself beside myself with anticipation.

195
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:50,722
A rogue image swam through me,

196
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:55,477
hubby's pruney old mouth
pursed at Sheba's breast.

197
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:06,488
After lunch,
a rather mortifying family tradition.

198
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:10,826
They do things differently
in bourgeois bohemia.

199
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:23,171
Oh! Thank you.

200
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:31,221
Come on. Come on.

201
00:15:31,306 --> 00:15:33,390
No.

202
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:00,334
- You ready?
- Watch out.

203
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:02,628
Yes!

204
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,005
He took me away for our anniversary.
It was years ago.

205
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:07,716
When we came back it was here,

206
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,384
as if by magic.

207
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:12,220
Oh!

208
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:15,807
It was supposed to be my studio, but

209
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:20,187
it's more of a refuge, really.

210
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:22,564
A room of one's own.

211
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:26,610
Is this you?

212
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:29,071
Mm.

213
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:31,365
It was.

214
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:35,243
Oh, I love these.

215
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:39,539
- Such vibrant colours.
- Take one. Take two. Have the lot, actually.

216
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:44,336
- I couldn't possibly.
- Honestly, no one else wants them.

217
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:47,381
I'll treasure them.

218
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:51,551
It must be exhausting,
running a family and teaching as well.

219
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:55,055
Oh, I can't wait for term to end.

220
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:58,767
Roll on Christmas and a month of sod all.

221
00:17:02,313 --> 00:17:06,108
I shouldn't have kidded myself
I could teach.

222
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:10,946
It's just that I've spent
the last ten years looking after Ben

223
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,865
and I was so desperate
to get out and do something,

224
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:19,121
and finally we get him into this great
local school and I'm free to work and...

225
00:17:20,081 --> 00:17:24,376
- You're gonna be a terrific teacher.
- Thanks.

226
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:28,964
But I'm bloody hopeless,
and everyone knows it.

227
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:31,133
Children are feral.

228
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,136
Don't let them sense your anxiety.

229
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:39,850
- How do you cope?
- Oh, I'm just a battle-axe.

230
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,978
I'm not popular, but they respect me.

231
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:48,275
Well, you're popular with me.
It's strange. I feel like I can talk to you.

232
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:51,278
She spoke of her vile mother,

233
00:17:52,155 --> 00:17:55,699
her grief over the death of her father,

234
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:58,994
the glory days when Richard
scooped her up

235
00:17:59,162 --> 00:18:05,167
and then jettisoned wife and children
for what she called a nonstop fuckfest.

236
00:18:06,169 --> 00:18:12,340
It's a peculiar trait of the privileged,
immediate incautious intimacy.

237
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:17,053
But Sheba went well beyond
the tendencies of her class.

238
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:20,682
She was utterly candid,

239
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:25,020
a novice confessing to the mother superior.

240
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:30,066
You know, marriage and kids,
I mean, it's wonderful,

241
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:33,403
but it doesn't give you meaning.

242
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:37,282
It gives you an imperative
but it doesn't help you...

243
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:42,204
My father always used to say,
you know, on the tube, "Mind the gap."

244
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:51,087
I don't know. It's just the distance
between life as you dream it

245
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:53,256
and

246
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:56,927
life as it is.

247
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:02,140
I know exactly what you mean.

248
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:12,025
A gold-star day.

249
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:16,571
I always knew we'd be friends.

250
00:19:16,948 --> 00:19:19,032
Our mutual reserve inhibited us,

251
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:23,787
but now it is manifest,
a spiritual recognition.

252
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,916
Many of you
will enjoy Christmas.

253
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:31,086
S and I share the ability

254
00:19:31,254 --> 00:19:35,966
to see through
the quotidian awfulness of things.

255
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:40,762
In a different, better age,

256
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:43,932
we would be ladies of leisure,
lunching together,

257
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:46,685
visiting galleries, travelling,

258
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:49,062
putting the world to rights.

259
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:52,941
We would be companions.

260
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:02,993
Christ by highest heaven adored

261
00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:06,538
Christ the everlasting Lord

262
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:09,583
Late in time behold him come

263
00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:12,919
Offspring of a virgin's womb

264
00:20:13,004 --> 00:20:16,214
It's taken. I'm saving it for Sheba.

265
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,465
Sorry.

266
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,634
Hail the incarnate Deity

267
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,846
Pleased as man with man to dwell

268
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:26,433
Jesus, Emmanuel

269
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:29,728
Hark! The herald angels sing

270
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:34,357
Glory to the newborn King

271
00:21:31,082 --> 00:21:33,500
Very good. Well done.

272
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:53,144
Hark! The herald angels sing

273
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:56,064
"Glory to the newborn King"

274
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,483
Hark! The herald angels sing

275
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:01,486
"Glory to the newborn King"

276
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,989
Hark! The herald angels sing

277
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:07,617
Glory to the newborn King

278
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,448
Ben, pop it in the car, sweetheart. Hello?

279
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:49,743
I need to speak to you
about Steven Connolly.

280
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:54,039
- Who?
- Let's not, shall we?

281
00:22:54,457 --> 00:22:58,251
Doubtless you're aware
you've committed a criminal offence.

282
00:22:58,586 --> 00:23:00,962
I'll be with you at five.

283
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:07,052
Let's go to the pub, OK?

284
00:23:10,264 --> 00:23:12,849
When will you tell them?

285
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,477
I need to know the circumstances.

286
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:18,146
You must inform me of everything.

287
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:24,402
Actually, you were there
when I first saw him.

288
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:27,197
I think you gave him a telling off.

289
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:30,325
I gave him a slight ticking off.

290
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:33,161
He dedicated his goal to me.

291
00:23:33,621 --> 00:23:36,331
It amused me, nothing more.

292
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:42,128
Then a few days later he came to see me.

293
00:23:42,505 --> 00:23:47,592
- Would you have a look at me drawings?
- I'll look in class. You do Art, don't you?

294
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:50,929
I'm not allowed. I'm special needs.

295
00:23:51,347 --> 00:23:54,099
I gotta do extra reading instead.

296
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:56,851
Did you do these at home?

297
00:24:05,528 --> 00:24:07,946
These are good.

298
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:10,323
You can draw.

299
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:16,830
If we pull strings for one child
the whole system will unravel.

300
00:24:16,914 --> 00:24:20,250
But he's talented.
He's found something he believes in.

301
00:24:20,334 --> 00:24:22,460
Well, they're all talented.

302
00:24:23,212 --> 00:24:26,422
You found your gem, as Sue would say.

303
00:24:26,507 --> 00:24:31,344
I said that I would teach him after school,
but only if he felt like it.

304
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:35,473
- It's our job, isn't it?
- Within specified hours and curriculum.

305
00:24:35,558 --> 00:24:39,310
Barbara, he came every day for two weeks.

306
00:24:40,271 --> 00:24:43,481
Yes, I was flattered, but more than that.

307
00:24:43,566 --> 00:24:47,068
I was excited to find someone
who wanted to learn.

308
00:24:47,153 --> 00:24:53,366
And he imagined this sort of helicopter
500 years ago. It does your brain in.

309
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:56,786
But surely you must have
suspected his motives?

310
00:24:56,871 --> 00:25:01,708
I sensed he had a little crush on me,
but so what?

311
00:25:01,792 --> 00:25:03,877
It was innocent.

312
00:25:03,961 --> 00:25:07,213
That's so much better.
You've absolutely got that knuckle.

313
00:25:07,298 --> 00:25:09,382
Nailed it.

314
00:25:11,177 --> 00:25:15,430
- Do that again, Miss.
- Don't be silly. Off you go.

315
00:25:16,807 --> 00:25:21,394
- What are you having for tea, Miss?
- Probably buy something on the way home.

316
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:23,563
- Are you a good cook?
- Not really.

317
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:25,732
You suck?

318
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:31,988
Go home, Steven.

319
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:45,710
- That's when you should have stopped it.
- I did.

320
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:47,962
I told him I wouldn't teach him any more.

321
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:51,174
But he refused to accept it.
He just kept coming back.

322
00:25:53,469 --> 00:25:55,553
Miss!

323
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:59,724
It began to feel like our secret,

324
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:04,604
and secrets can be seductive.

325
00:26:15,324 --> 00:26:19,160
- D'you wanna come for a walk?
- Absolutely not.

326
00:26:19,787 --> 00:26:23,039
I'm going home to my family.
As should you.

327
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:25,166
Miss!

328
00:26:28,337 --> 00:26:32,548
My dad's got the sack.
He's been taking it out on me.

329
00:26:32,633 --> 00:26:36,636
His father hit him.
He didn't tell his mum because she was ill.

330
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,765
- Does your mother know?
- Kidney disease.

331
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:44,769
- It's taking months for an operation.
- He was so vulnerable.

332
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:47,647
If he does it again, you tell me.

333
00:26:47,898 --> 00:26:50,066
Thanks, Miss.

334
00:26:51,068 --> 00:26:53,111
You're beautiful, Miss.

335
00:26:53,195 --> 00:26:54,946
You don't know how beautiful you are.

336
00:27:02,204 --> 00:27:06,249
I hadn't been pursued
like this for years.

337
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:11,212
I knew it was wrong and immoral
and completely ridiculous,

338
00:27:11,297 --> 00:27:14,007
but I don't know.

339
00:27:14,091 --> 00:27:16,634
I just allowed it to happen.

340
00:27:16,719 --> 00:27:18,761
The boy is 15!

341
00:27:21,307 --> 00:27:25,268
- But he's quite mature for his age.
- "But" is not a helpful word here.

342
00:27:26,854 --> 00:27:29,355
This is going to sound sick

343
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:37,196
but something in me felt entitled.
You know, I've been good all my adult life.

344
00:27:37,281 --> 00:27:41,784
I've been a decent wife,
dutiful mother, coping with Ben.

345
00:27:42,536 --> 00:27:46,664
This voice inside me kept saying,
"Why shouldn't you be bad?

346
00:27:46,749 --> 00:27:50,960
"You know, why shouldn't you transgress?
You've earned the right."

347
00:27:51,045 --> 00:27:52,545
I said get out, Denzel.

348
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:57,050
The rest of you get on
with your work, please.

349
00:27:57,134 --> 00:27:59,427
Hurry up.

350
00:28:26,622 --> 00:28:29,874
Sue phoned. OK if I meet her for a drink?

351
00:28:30,751 --> 00:28:33,669
Sure. I'll put bug-a-lugs to bed.

352
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:50,311
Evening, Miss.

353
00:29:21,343 --> 00:29:23,636
Make yourself comfortable.

354
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:27,807
It's incredibly important
we keep this secret.

355
00:29:30,853 --> 00:29:33,980
- Does anyone know you're here?
- No.

356
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:40,486
Miss.

357
00:29:40,571 --> 00:29:43,531
I'm no genius, but I ain't a dickhead.

358
00:29:44,283 --> 00:29:46,200
I won't tell no one.

359
00:29:46,535 --> 00:29:48,786
You can trust me.

360
00:29:51,582 --> 00:29:54,792
We'd both get into terrible trouble.

361
00:30:19,193 --> 00:30:22,487
It was easy, like having another drink

362
00:30:22,571 --> 00:30:25,448
when you know you shouldn't.

363
00:30:28,577 --> 00:30:30,828
Can I smoke, Miss?

364
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:35,416
You can do what you want,
but enough of this "Miss".

365
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:47,762
Were you a model once?

366
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:52,475
Well, you should have been.
You're well fit.

367
00:30:52,893 --> 00:30:55,019
Gosh, but don't I know it.

368
00:30:55,229 --> 00:30:57,522
You're into The Streets?

369
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:00,358
Well, my daughter is.

370
00:31:01,485 --> 00:31:04,278
Is she the same age as me?

371
00:31:04,488 --> 00:31:06,656
None of your beeswax.

372
00:31:11,453 --> 00:31:14,789
Well, anyway, the point is you're fit.

373
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:19,544
Well, so are you.

374
00:31:19,795 --> 00:31:25,174
You reckon? My sister thinks
I look like a bollock with measles.

375
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:29,470
You've done my brain in.

376
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:02,628
You wanna do it again?

377
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:06,007
What?

378
00:32:08,218 --> 00:32:10,177
Yes.

379
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:19,020
I wanna do it again.

380
00:32:20,689 --> 00:32:22,940
The day we met,

381
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:25,318
it had already begun?

382
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:28,904
Yes.

383
00:32:28,989 --> 00:32:31,490
Deputy head in the morning.

384
00:32:31,575 --> 00:32:35,745
Noble sentiment, Connolly.
Next time, words, not fists.

385
00:32:35,829 --> 00:32:37,955
Get inside, both of you.

386
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:44,503
- And you had further relations that day?
- We went to the art room.

387
00:32:44,588 --> 00:32:48,215
Well, I'm glad I was such an aphrodisiac.
I was trying to help you.

388
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:51,344
You did. I'm incredibly grateful.

389
00:32:51,428 --> 00:32:54,221
You've been such a good friend.

390
00:32:55,724 --> 00:32:58,184
Not reciprocated, it seems.

391
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:05,066
I desperately wanted to confess to you.

392
00:33:06,068 --> 00:33:07,902
But how could I?

393
00:33:08,779 --> 00:33:10,279
Barbara?

394
00:33:10,572 --> 00:33:14,075
It would have put you
in an impossible situation.

395
00:33:16,328 --> 00:33:18,704
I so wish I had.

396
00:33:18,914 --> 00:33:21,707
You would have made me see sense.

397
00:33:22,042 --> 00:33:25,586
And then I realised
my fury had blinded me.

398
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:29,924
There was a magnificent opportunity here.

399
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:33,344
Can we go inside? I'm absolutely freezing.

400
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:41,018
With stealth,
I might secure the prize long term,

401
00:33:41,103 --> 00:33:44,230
forever in my debt.

402
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:47,942
I could gain everything

403
00:33:48,318 --> 00:33:50,403
by doing nothing.

404
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:54,949
Look...

405
00:33:56,535 --> 00:34:01,414
I know you have to tell them.
You know, the head, the school.

406
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:05,042
All I ask is that you wait till the New Year.

407
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:10,423
I'm begging you. Please let me have
this Christmas with my family.

408
00:34:10,632 --> 00:34:13,926
Oh, you poor thing.

409
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:17,138
You've got yourself into a state?

410
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:20,558
I'm not going to report you.

411
00:34:21,435 --> 00:34:25,479
I want to help you,
to support you through this.

412
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:33,070
You're not going to tell?

413
00:34:35,365 --> 00:34:37,825
- You won't tell anyone?
- Who would it benefit?

414
00:34:37,993 --> 00:34:41,412
Not you or the boy,
and certainly not the school.

415
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:44,290
No, this is a private matter,

416
00:34:45,125 --> 00:34:48,043
and we must keep it so.

417
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:50,921
Yes.

418
00:34:56,386 --> 00:34:58,512
- Maybe I should resign.
- Oh, no.

419
00:34:58,597 --> 00:35:00,681
No, that might alert suspicion.

420
00:35:00,766 --> 00:35:06,061
No, you must stay at the school,
but the affair must end.

421
00:35:06,313 --> 00:35:08,647
Your solemn promise.

422
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:13,319
I can't help you if you don't promise.

423
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:16,447
I promise.

424
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:22,328
So you'll tell him straight after Christmas?

425
00:35:22,412 --> 00:35:25,080
- It's all for the best.
- I know.

426
00:35:25,165 --> 00:35:29,251
Thank you so much.
You've been so brilliant.

427
00:35:29,336 --> 00:35:32,087
And you'll tell me when it's done?

428
00:35:36,593 --> 00:35:39,136
Oh! You never said.

429
00:35:39,429 --> 00:35:42,181
Standard issue for spinsters.

430
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:45,476
She's been off her food.
I'm worried about her.

431
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:49,230
There's a terrific vet up the road.
He was great with Ben's rabbit.

432
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:55,236
- Got many people coming tomorrow?
- My lot, Richard's lot, including first wife.

433
00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:57,822
Oh. And your mother?

434
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,157
Oh, yes.

435
00:36:00,242 --> 00:36:02,993
- Well, happy Christmas.
- Yeah. You, too.

436
00:36:03,078 --> 00:36:05,621
Thank you so much.

437
00:36:05,789 --> 00:36:07,414
Courage, mon brave.

438
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:12,044
And bon voyage to her little leprechaun.

439
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:18,509
Sheba and I share
a deep understanding now.

440
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:22,930
No one can violate

441
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:25,599
our magnificent complicity.

442
00:36:25,767 --> 00:36:28,686
No! Wait till tomorrow! Stop.

443
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,606
You've been gone ages.

444
00:36:32,816 --> 00:36:34,108
Oh.

445
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:37,152
Barbara was a little... Some school thing.

446
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:40,281
- How's his nibs?
- Oh, still awake.

447
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:44,118
He's madly excited.
I said he could stay up for you.

448
00:36:44,578 --> 00:36:45,744
And Polly?

449
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:48,622
- Depressed.
- Oh.

450
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:50,583
Pete phoned.

451
00:36:50,876 --> 00:36:52,710
They had a row

452
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:55,379
and he's not coming tomorrow.

453
00:36:56,381 --> 00:37:01,594
- D'you think he's bad news?
- Well, these older men can be very dodgy.

454
00:37:19,029 --> 00:37:21,322
Did Daddy tell you?

455
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:28,245
He's gonna bin me, I know it.

456
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:30,414
You're very lovely, darling.

457
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:33,584
He's clever enough to appreciate it.

458
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:36,128
I'm fat as fuck, Mum.

459
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:40,716
He'll be back.

460
00:37:41,009 --> 00:37:43,010
I can't live without him.

461
00:37:43,303 --> 00:37:45,387
Oh...

462
00:37:47,557 --> 00:37:51,769
Her fetish for the boy
was simply her snobbery manifested.

463
00:37:51,853 --> 00:37:54,188
He's working class and he likes art,

464
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:57,441
as if he were a monkey
who just strolled out of a rainforest

465
00:37:57,525 --> 00:38:00,986
and asked for a gin and tonic.

466
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:09,286
Have you heard from
that friend of yours, Barbara?

467
00:38:09,371 --> 00:38:12,665
Bar? Wakey-wakey.

468
00:38:12,749 --> 00:38:16,585
Lorraine was asking if you'd heard
from that nice friend of yours.

469
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:18,754
- Who?
- Jennifer Dodd.

470
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:21,590
Oh.

471
00:38:21,675 --> 00:38:24,426
She left the school.

472
00:38:24,511 --> 00:38:27,137
She's teaching in a primary at Stoke.

473
00:38:27,889 --> 00:38:32,476
There's a chap, apparently.
I heard they're engaged.

474
00:38:36,189 --> 00:38:38,315
But it's true, it would be insane,
wouldn't it?

475
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,402
It's the most ridiculous time for him to sell.

476
00:38:41,486 --> 00:38:43,988
Well, that's what I said.

477
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:46,198
I know. He should give me a ring.

478
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:49,076
It's absolute madness for him.
I'm happy to...

479
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,120
There you are, darling.

480
00:38:51,204 --> 00:38:54,957
...Victorian parent or something.
I'm nothing of the kind!

481
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:58,293
Darling, can we have gravy?
There's no gravy. Sorry.

482
00:38:58,378 --> 00:39:00,963
Why can't we just have...

483
00:39:27,282 --> 00:39:30,117
God knows.
But this is what she's like.

484
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:34,580
Ever since Ronald died,
she's drifted inexorably.

485
00:39:34,664 --> 00:39:39,501
You see, her father was
an exceptional man. Exceptional.

486
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:42,046
Bathsheba's a loner, I'm afraid.

487
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:45,841
She's beautiful, thank God,
and it's got her through,

488
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:49,928
but it's not quite the same
as possessing substance.

489
00:39:58,271 --> 00:39:59,438
Happy Christmas.

490
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:02,191
What are you doing here?
Everyone's inside.

491
00:40:02,442 --> 00:40:05,027
Aren't you gonna open it?

492
00:40:09,991 --> 00:40:13,118
It's made of real fake gold.

493
00:40:16,498 --> 00:40:19,083
- Thank you.
- What's up?

494
00:40:19,501 --> 00:40:21,585
I haven't heard from you.

495
00:40:25,632 --> 00:40:27,841
I can't see you any more.

496
00:40:28,718 --> 00:40:30,677
I'm sorry. I...

497
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:33,764
I just can't. It's over.

498
00:40:35,058 --> 00:40:38,018
- Why?
- Bash?

499
00:40:38,103 --> 00:40:39,394
Bash!

500
00:40:40,063 --> 00:40:41,814
She's not here.

501
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:48,529
Was that your dad?

502
00:40:50,532 --> 00:40:51,865
No.

503
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:54,034
He's an uncle.

504
00:40:56,788 --> 00:41:00,833
- Do you wanna end it?
- Please don't look at me like that.

505
00:41:00,917 --> 00:41:03,377
- Have you gone off me?
- No.

506
00:41:04,671 --> 00:41:08,132
You should go. Please, don't make...

507
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:10,759
Just go.

508
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:33,490
She gave me what?

509
00:41:33,575 --> 00:41:37,035
- What colour are they?
- Is it Pete?

510
00:42:01,811 --> 00:42:05,480
I long to phone S, but it's late.

511
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:11,028
Poor girl, all alone with her awful family.

512
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:16,200
Our lives are acutely similar
in so many respects.

513
00:42:16,409 --> 00:42:19,077
Sis?

514
00:42:21,873 --> 00:42:23,832
Oh.

515
00:42:23,917 --> 00:42:27,711
Writing the old diary?
I can't imagine how you keep at it.

516
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:30,088
I'd have nothing to say.

517
00:42:31,841 --> 00:42:33,842
Aw.

518
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:37,596
Hello.

519
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:42,434
You know you're welcome
whenever you want, not just once a year.

520
00:42:43,728 --> 00:42:47,105
It's just that I'm rather busy
at the moment.

521
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:49,983
Your racy London life.

522
00:42:50,151 --> 00:42:52,444
I'm glad it's so full.

523
00:42:56,282 --> 00:43:00,035
I'm sorry about Jennifer. She was lovely.

524
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:06,583
Is there anyone else?
Someone else who's special?

525
00:43:07,669 --> 00:43:09,836
I don't know what you mean.

526
00:43:10,171 --> 00:43:12,589
I... I didn't mean to pry.

527
00:43:33,486 --> 00:43:34,820
Belated Christmas present.

528
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:37,531
Oh, thank you.

529
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:42,327
Oh, my word.

530
00:43:42,996 --> 00:43:44,788
Asprey.

531
00:43:58,553 --> 00:44:01,221
How is she?

532
00:44:03,224 --> 00:44:05,726
You are the most wonderful friend.

533
00:44:22,285 --> 00:44:24,703
Any good?

534
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:28,582
It's a masterpiece.

535
00:44:30,043 --> 00:44:32,794
Don't they teach you anything?

536
00:44:46,392 --> 00:44:48,643
We used to worship her.

537
00:44:57,987 --> 00:45:00,447
- Take it off.
- What's it for?

538
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:03,950
Just take it off, please. I'm still making it.

539
00:45:04,035 --> 00:45:06,119
Yeah, but why?

540
00:45:07,372 --> 00:45:10,290
- It's for my son.
- But he's 12, isn't he?

541
00:45:10,375 --> 00:45:13,418
He's got Down's syndrome.

542
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:19,466
You never said.

543
00:45:21,928 --> 00:45:23,637
Right.

544
00:45:25,223 --> 00:45:27,307
Sorry.

545
00:45:39,821 --> 00:45:41,613
Oh...

546
00:45:41,823 --> 00:45:43,865
Oh.

547
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:48,328
- I'm sure she's had a very happy life.
- Well, yes.

548
00:45:48,413 --> 00:45:51,373
She has. Thank you.

549
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:54,418
We can make her more comfortable
for the next few weeks,

550
00:45:54,502 --> 00:45:57,671
but it will be weeks rather than months.

551
00:45:58,798 --> 00:46:01,383
You've had a terrible shock.

552
00:46:03,344 --> 00:46:06,138
Where's Richard?
I don't want to disturb you.

553
00:46:06,347 --> 00:46:09,808
It's fine. Everyone's out.

554
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:15,856
Can they treat her?

555
00:46:16,232 --> 00:46:19,276
He says it's just a matter of weeks.

556
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:23,447
- She's only a pet.
- Oh, no.

557
00:46:23,531 --> 00:46:26,408
I cried for weeks
when our dog died. Weeks.

558
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:28,869
One does get so attached.

559
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:42,549
I should leave you in peace.

560
00:46:44,427 --> 00:46:46,511
Yeah.

561
00:46:56,481 --> 00:46:59,566
- I like that top. It suits you.
- Oh. Thanks.

562
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:06,907
When I was at school

563
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:12,078
if one of us had had some bad news
or was a bit down,

564
00:47:12,914 --> 00:47:14,915
we used to stroke each other.

565
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:20,420
You know, someone would do one arm
and someone else the other.

566
00:47:22,048 --> 00:47:24,257
It was a wonderful sensation.

567
00:47:24,425 --> 00:47:26,384
Did you do that at your school?

568
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:29,095
No.

569
00:47:29,347 --> 00:47:32,015
It's incredibly relaxing

570
00:47:33,434 --> 00:47:36,228
for the giver and the receiver.

571
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:45,570
- Close your eyes. No, no, really.
- Oh...

572
00:47:45,655 --> 00:47:48,156
It doesn't work if you don't.

573
00:48:26,404 --> 00:48:28,989
- There's a good girl.
- That's enough.

574
00:48:29,115 --> 00:48:33,493
- No, close your eyes.
- Look, I really think that's enough, Barbara.

575
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:44,963
There's someone in your garden!
He came over the wall.

576
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:48,174
It's probably the neighbour's boy,
lost his football.

577
00:48:48,259 --> 00:48:52,387
- No, he's going into the summer house!
- It's just a kid from next door. Forget it.

578
00:49:01,522 --> 00:49:06,318
Where are you? I've been dreaming
about your hot, sweet cunt all morning.

579
00:49:06,902 --> 00:49:08,612
Hello?

580
00:49:10,448 --> 00:49:13,575
- Hello?
- Richard's on his way home.

581
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:18,913
No, I can't. No, I can't. I'll call you.
Barbara! Barbara, I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

582
00:49:19,749 --> 00:49:22,542
I'm so sorry. Bar.

583
00:49:22,627 --> 00:49:25,128
I tried to end it, honestly. I just couldn't.

584
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:28,798
I risked everything for you,
and in return you humiliate me.

585
00:49:28,883 --> 00:49:33,470
I didn't mean to upset you. I need your help
more than ever. Please don't go like this.

586
00:49:33,554 --> 00:49:36,598
- You promised to end it. Why didn't you?
- Because I...

587
00:49:36,682 --> 00:49:38,475
What? You're in love?

588
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:42,979
And the child, do you imagine
he reciprocates your soppy feelings?

589
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:47,525
I dare say he's fascinated by the neurotic
compulsions of a middle-class lady

590
00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:49,819
- with marital problems.
- Bar...

591
00:49:49,904 --> 00:49:52,072
There's nothing crueller than boys.

592
00:49:52,156 --> 00:49:55,283
Once he's had his fill
he'll discard you like an old rag.

593
00:49:55,368 --> 00:49:56,618
You're not young!

594
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:01,665
I say this to help you. End it now.

595
00:50:03,751 --> 00:50:06,169
- Yeah. I'm thinking.
- Don't think. Do.

596
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:10,215
Do, do, do, do! Or shall I sit here
doing my nails till your husband returns?

597
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:14,052
- No, no, no! Please. I'll do it.
- Well, what are you waiting for?

598
00:50:36,701 --> 00:50:38,827
Mr. Connolly.

599
00:50:38,911 --> 00:50:42,914
I'm Mrs. Hart from St George's.
Steven's not in trouble.

600
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:47,377
- I need to talk to him about an art project...
- Oh, yeah. Come in. Come in.

601
00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:51,005
- Thank you.
- It's just upstairs there.

602
00:50:54,343 --> 00:50:58,304
It's good of you to give him extra lessons.
It's the first on your left.

603
00:50:58,389 --> 00:51:01,599
It's probably best to knock.

604
00:51:09,275 --> 00:51:14,446
- So that's your vicious father?
- You wanted a sob story, I gave it to you.

605
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:16,865
- You lied to me.
- Oh, sorry, Miss!

606
00:51:17,116 --> 00:51:19,159
You prefer it if I live in a shithole?

607
00:51:19,243 --> 00:51:21,369
And your mother?

608
00:51:21,454 --> 00:51:23,663
I think she's gonna pull through.

609
00:51:23,748 --> 00:51:26,833
What do you want?
What are you doing here?

610
00:51:30,212 --> 00:51:31,921
They're gonna expel me now!

611
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:35,383
No, they won't.
I'll get the blame if she tells.

612
00:51:35,843 --> 00:51:37,677
As if she won't!

613
00:51:38,012 --> 00:51:40,180
She likes me. She might not.

614
00:51:40,431 --> 00:51:43,850
Likes you how? Like that?
You giving her one and all?

615
00:51:44,059 --> 00:51:46,227
Why are you being so cruel?

616
00:51:46,562 --> 00:51:48,772
Why, Steven?

617
00:51:49,982 --> 00:51:52,942
I really like you. You're a nice person

618
00:51:53,027 --> 00:51:55,820
and you've been cool
and it's been great, OK?

619
00:51:55,905 --> 00:52:00,158
But it was supposed to be fun,
and now it's a serious thing.

620
00:52:02,411 --> 00:52:08,374
Whatever shit you're working out,
you know, your husband, your kid, you...

621
00:52:10,044 --> 00:52:12,295
I don't know.

622
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:14,672
I can't help you.

623
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:11,271
As my mother would have said,
the boy done her like a kipper.

624
00:53:13,232 --> 00:53:17,068
She has nowhere to turn but trusty old Bar.

625
00:53:24,618 --> 00:53:28,830
She mopes and mourns
for her pubescent paramour

626
00:53:31,125 --> 00:53:35,461
but she knows my interventions
have saved her life

627
00:53:36,797 --> 00:53:39,549
and she is sweetly grateful.

628
00:53:40,551 --> 00:53:44,846
Her betrayal hurt me
more than I dare show,

629
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:46,973
but I will forgive her

630
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:48,975
and heal myself in private.

631
00:53:50,519 --> 00:53:52,896
She's worth it, this one.

632
00:53:53,522 --> 00:53:55,815
She's the one I've waited for.

633
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:03,489
She's beginning to understand
that her dalliance with Master Connolly

634
00:54:03,574 --> 00:54:06,409
was a consequence of her dead marriage.

635
00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:11,748
It's a sham fuelled only
by the memory of former glories.

636
00:54:14,001 --> 00:54:16,961
Whereas we are going through the fire,

637
00:54:17,046 --> 00:54:21,883
forging our friendship
with a stronger bond each day.

638
00:54:23,427 --> 00:54:26,971
In fact, we are now entering

639
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:29,974
a delicate new phase.

640
00:54:30,935 --> 00:54:34,187
We are silently and stealthily

641
00:54:34,355 --> 00:54:38,858
negotiating the terms
of a life lived together.

642
00:54:40,027 --> 00:54:42,487
Now more than ever,

643
00:54:42,571 --> 00:54:45,865
we are bound by the secrets we share.

644
00:54:48,035 --> 00:54:54,540
I'm invited to drop in on them this summer
at their house in the Dordogne.

645
00:54:56,168 --> 00:54:58,419
I might just do that.

646
00:55:05,469 --> 00:55:09,055
I once sat here discussing Elgar
for three hours.

647
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:12,266
- God, who with?
- Oh, just a friend.

648
00:55:12,351 --> 00:55:15,979
Jennifer. This was our haunt.

649
00:55:19,608 --> 00:55:23,486
We were quite chummy for a while,
but poor thing,

650
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:27,824
- she suffered from a terrible depression.
- Oh.

651
00:55:27,908 --> 00:55:31,786
I tried to help, but she rather unravelled.

652
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:34,622
She became alarmingly deluded.

653
00:55:34,707 --> 00:55:37,291
Did she go to hospital?

654
00:55:37,376 --> 00:55:38,918
No.

655
00:55:39,003 --> 00:55:41,087
No, she got a job in Stoke.

656
00:55:42,256 --> 00:55:44,340
- When was this?
- Last summer.

657
00:55:44,425 --> 00:55:49,846
- But I feel I should have done more.
- I'm sure she knows you did your best.

658
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:52,015
Such a sensitive person.

659
00:55:52,683 --> 00:55:55,059
One conceals it, of course.

660
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:06,529
People languish for years with partners
who are clearly from another planet.

661
00:56:06,613 --> 00:56:11,451
We want so much to believe
that we've found our other.

662
00:56:12,661 --> 00:56:18,624
It takes courage to recognise the real
as opposed to the convenient.

663
00:56:20,544 --> 00:56:25,048
When I was young
I had such a vision of myself.

664
00:56:25,132 --> 00:56:31,137
I dreamed I'd be someone to be reckoned
with, you know, in the world.

665
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:33,639
But one learns one's scale.

666
00:56:38,437 --> 00:56:41,773
I've such a dread of ending my days alone.

667
00:56:41,857 --> 00:56:44,442
Yes. I... We all do.

668
00:56:44,526 --> 00:56:49,363
But recently I've allowed myself to think
that I may not be.

669
00:56:53,994 --> 00:56:56,287
Am I wrong?

670
00:56:59,291 --> 00:57:01,709
No.

671
00:57:14,973 --> 00:57:17,308
Do you want to stay?

672
00:57:17,392 --> 00:57:22,605
Sometimes people find it comforting
to see them at peace.

673
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:27,527
Would you like to come back
in 20 minutes to say goodbye?

674
00:57:35,786 --> 00:57:39,455
- Have you got your seat belt on?
- Oh, no. What the fuck?

675
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:42,917
- Oh, God, not her!
- Shut up. I won't be a minute.

676
00:57:43,001 --> 00:57:48,548
- Mum, don't get out of the car!
- Is it Portia? Oh, no.

677
00:57:49,716 --> 00:57:52,677
I've got to go back
to the vet's after it's done.

678
00:57:52,761 --> 00:57:55,179
Will you come with me? I can't on my own.

679
00:57:55,389 --> 00:57:59,892
Of course I would. It's just that
Ben's doing his play at his school...

680
00:57:59,977 --> 00:58:02,812
- Play?
- We're all going. We're late, actually.

681
00:58:02,896 --> 00:58:06,190
- Someone has died!
- I... I know.

682
00:58:07,067 --> 00:58:10,736
- And it's terribly sad.
- You owe me this!

683
00:58:10,821 --> 00:58:13,865
Ben, can't you make her vanish?
Use your wand.

684
00:58:13,949 --> 00:58:17,368
He's doing a show for
the first time in his life.

685
00:58:17,452 --> 00:58:20,079
That's your choice, is it?

686
00:58:21,081 --> 00:58:22,790
Why don't you come?

687
00:58:23,167 --> 00:58:25,334
I thought you understood
what friendship means.

688
00:58:26,086 --> 00:58:28,462
He's my child. He's my son.

689
00:58:29,423 --> 00:58:32,675
- He's just a little boy.
- Don't play the good mother with me.

690
00:58:32,926 --> 00:58:36,179
Could you tell me what's going on?
Is this some kind of coven?

691
00:58:36,263 --> 00:58:37,680
I can explain perfectly.

692
00:58:37,764 --> 00:58:39,974
Barbara's had some bad news
about her cat.

693
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:43,686
My condolences. Poor pussy.
Now, can I have my wife back, please?

694
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:46,189
- I don't like your tone.
- Why is she here?

695
00:58:46,273 --> 00:58:49,233
What kind of fucking spell
has she cast on you?

696
00:58:49,318 --> 00:58:53,821
- Ben is getting stressed. He's gonna blow!
- Oh, for God's sake. Get in the car!

697
00:58:53,906 --> 00:58:56,949
Give me a minute, will you?
I can handle this.

698
00:58:57,034 --> 00:58:59,368
I'm to be handled, am I? Like toxic waste?

699
00:58:59,453 --> 00:59:03,873
You see me on sufferance.
I'm an imposition to be tolerated.

700
00:59:03,957 --> 00:59:08,419
No, of course not. I love our time together.
I'm your good, good friend.

701
00:59:08,503 --> 00:59:10,087
Then stay with me.

702
00:59:10,172 --> 00:59:15,092
I would if I could. I'm desperately sorry
about Portia, but you can see, I have to go.

703
00:59:15,177 --> 00:59:19,055
Think very carefully, madam.
Be aware of the consequences.

704
00:59:19,139 --> 00:59:22,350
- Don't make this mean any more than it is.
- Stay with me.

705
00:59:24,019 --> 00:59:26,437
- I don't know what I'll do.
- Let's go!

706
00:59:26,521 --> 00:59:30,066
- Look, I'll call you, I promise.
- Come on!

707
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:37,031
They always let you down in the end.

708
00:59:37,699 --> 00:59:40,284
Jennifer said I was too intense.

709
00:59:40,369 --> 00:59:42,495
Meaning what, exactly?

710
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:46,249
That I am loyal in my friendships?

711
00:59:46,333 --> 00:59:49,669
That I will go to the ends of the earth
for someone I admire?

712
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:52,171
Shazam!

713
01:00:17,197 --> 01:00:19,907
Not disturbing you, am I?

714
01:00:21,994 --> 01:00:24,370
It's just...

715
01:00:24,871 --> 01:00:26,998
I need to talk to you about Mrs. Hart.

716
01:00:29,042 --> 01:00:31,794
- Sheba.
- Ah.

717
01:00:32,504 --> 01:00:34,547
It's a bit delicate.

718
01:00:34,923 --> 01:00:36,048
Can I come in?

719
01:00:49,604 --> 01:00:52,064
- Tea?
- Oh, lovely, thanks.

720
01:00:56,445 --> 01:00:59,071
You haven't got a biscuit?

721
01:01:05,329 --> 01:01:07,413
Cheers.

722
01:01:10,083 --> 01:01:13,669
- Would you like me to take your hat?
- Ah. Been up the Lane.

723
01:01:13,754 --> 01:01:16,130
White Hart Lane,
home of the mighty Spurs.

724
01:01:16,214 --> 01:01:19,592
- Were you victorious?
- Three-nil. Jermain Defoe. Get in there!

725
01:01:22,596 --> 01:01:26,265
My father was a supporter
of Charlton Athletic.

726
01:01:27,392 --> 01:01:29,894
Never seemed to give him any pleasure.

727
01:01:30,270 --> 01:01:31,771
Where's the moggy?

728
01:01:32,647 --> 01:01:34,065
She's dead.

729
01:01:35,567 --> 01:01:37,610
Oh, dear.

730
01:01:38,278 --> 01:01:41,530
Oh, my condolences. Aw.

731
01:01:44,368 --> 01:01:46,619
Oh, is this not a good time?

732
01:01:47,037 --> 01:01:49,163
It's a very good time.

733
01:02:01,468 --> 01:02:03,844
- Mrs. Hart.
- Yeah.

734
01:02:04,763 --> 01:02:06,764
It's just...

735
01:02:06,973 --> 01:02:10,101
Anything you tell me
will be in strictest confidence.

736
01:02:12,104 --> 01:02:16,065
Well, the thing is,
I was wondering if she's

737
01:02:17,818 --> 01:02:20,277
ever mentioned me.

738
01:02:21,696 --> 01:02:23,781
Does she ever mention me?

739
01:02:25,075 --> 01:02:28,494
Let me think. No, never.

740
01:02:29,371 --> 01:02:30,955
Actually, yes.

741
01:02:31,456 --> 01:02:34,708
She mentioned you had invested
in a new shirt last term.

742
01:02:34,918 --> 01:02:37,336
Splashed out at Nicole Farhi.

743
01:02:39,005 --> 01:02:44,468
Thing is, over the last few months...
Well, ever since I met her, really, I've...

744
01:02:45,762 --> 01:02:48,431
Brian, are you in love?

745
01:02:49,975 --> 01:02:54,186
- I've been a bit bloody obvious, haven't I?
- You've been utterly clandestine.

746
01:02:55,897 --> 01:02:58,858
- So she mentioned the shirt?
- You do know she's married?

747
01:02:58,984 --> 01:03:02,361
Yeah, but she's quite flirty,
and you never know with people, do you?

748
01:03:02,487 --> 01:03:05,739
- Indeed you don't.
- But...

749
01:03:06,032 --> 01:03:09,702
I wouldn't wanna make a move
if I'm just gonna get knocked back.

750
01:03:09,995 --> 01:03:14,498
What with staff politics and the head being
such a stickler, you have to be careful.

751
01:03:14,708 --> 01:03:16,250
It's a minefield.

752
01:03:16,626 --> 01:03:18,711
So would...

753
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:23,632
I mean, do you think
you could have a word with her

754
01:03:23,884 --> 01:03:27,344
and just suss the lie of the land?

755
01:03:29,181 --> 01:03:35,436
You'd like me to ask Mrs. Hart if she's
inclined to commit adultery with you?

756
01:03:38,523 --> 01:03:43,611
I don't want you to suffer more
than is necessary. No one should.

757
01:03:43,695 --> 01:03:49,742
I couldn't possibly speak for Mrs. Hart,
but instinct tells me

758
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:51,619
you might not be her type.

759
01:03:53,413 --> 01:03:56,165
She's got a type, then?

760
01:03:56,249 --> 01:03:59,752
Oh, it's no reflection
on your attractiveness.

761
01:04:00,545 --> 01:04:06,383
But my impression is that her preference
is for the younger man.

762
01:04:08,803 --> 01:04:11,555
Surprisingly young.

763
01:04:12,057 --> 01:04:13,599
Boys, I'm told.

764
01:04:15,143 --> 01:04:18,187
Naturally, she doesn't discuss
any of this with me.

765
01:04:18,563 --> 01:04:21,941
But I've been hearing some rather
alarming rumours about one in particular.

766
01:04:23,610 --> 01:04:27,071
Playground gossip,
staff room whispers and so on.

767
01:04:29,991 --> 01:04:32,952
You might know the boy in question.

768
01:04:36,331 --> 01:04:38,040
Steven Connolly.

769
01:04:39,584 --> 01:04:41,001
Year 10?

770
01:04:43,463 --> 01:04:46,048
I think the kettle's boiled.

771
01:04:47,133 --> 01:04:50,219
You say the words and it's done.

772
01:04:50,303 --> 01:04:52,346
Easy.

773
01:04:56,226 --> 01:04:59,228
Judas had the grace to hang himself,

774
01:04:59,312 --> 01:05:04,400
but only according to Matthew,
the most sentimental of the apostles.

775
01:05:06,403 --> 01:05:09,822
Is this the last night of her old life?

776
01:05:11,866 --> 01:05:15,953
I wonder how long my messenger will take.

777
01:05:16,830 --> 01:05:18,998
Thank you.

778
01:05:20,834 --> 01:05:24,670
People like Sheba think they know
what it is to be lonely,

779
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:30,342
but of the drip, drip of long-haul,
no-end-in-sight solitude,

780
01:05:31,261 --> 01:05:33,596
they know nothing.

781
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:39,435
What it's like to construct an entire
weekend around a visit to the launderette

782
01:05:39,519 --> 01:05:42,855
or to be so chronically untouched

783
01:05:43,398 --> 01:05:46,609
that the accidental brush
of a bus conductor's hand

784
01:05:46,693 --> 01:05:51,030
sends a jolt of longing
straight to your groin.

785
01:05:52,032 --> 01:05:53,949
Of this,

786
01:05:54,034 --> 01:05:58,704
Sheba and her like have no clue.

787
01:06:05,378 --> 01:06:09,465
Bar, I'm so sorry about today.

788
01:06:09,549 --> 01:06:12,593
It was an impossible situation.

789
01:06:12,677 --> 01:06:15,137
Richard's really sorry too.

790
01:06:15,221 --> 01:06:17,473
Poor you.

791
01:06:17,557 --> 01:06:19,642
But why not come for supper?

792
01:06:20,435 --> 01:06:23,187
Actually, I write quite quickly.

793
01:06:23,271 --> 01:06:26,357
It's the thinking that takes an eternity.

794
01:06:26,441 --> 01:06:31,111
But you're never satisfied. When
you're lecturing, you long for time to write,

795
01:06:31,363 --> 01:06:35,324
and when you've got it,
you yearn to be back with your students.

796
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:42,498
- More coffee, anyone?
- I'll have a slug.

797
01:06:42,832 --> 01:06:44,416
Barbara?

798
01:06:47,087 --> 01:06:48,587
No, thank you.

799
01:07:07,607 --> 01:07:09,441
- Yes?
- Are you her husband?

800
01:07:09,526 --> 01:07:12,236
- What? Whose?
- Don't you dick with me, mister!

801
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:14,405
Don't you dick me around! Where is she?

802
01:07:14,489 --> 01:07:17,574
Tell her Steven Connolly's mother
wants to see her now!

803
01:07:17,659 --> 01:07:20,411
- Excuse me!
- Maggie!

804
01:07:20,495 --> 01:07:23,580
- You slut! You fucking whore!
- Maggie!

805
01:07:24,124 --> 01:07:26,875
- How could you? How could you?
- Maggie! Maggie!

806
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:31,505
- He's only a child! A wee boy! He's a child!
- What the hell is going on?

807
01:07:31,589 --> 01:07:34,633
You ask your wife what's going on!
Ask her!

808
01:07:34,718 --> 01:07:38,053
- You perverted bitch! Bitch!
- Maggie!

809
01:07:38,138 --> 01:07:42,474
Come on. Leave them alone!
Come on, Maggie. Leave them alone.

810
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:47,730
- Bitch! You fucking...
- Leave them alone, Maggie.

811
01:07:47,814 --> 01:07:49,940
Come on. Leave them alone, eh?

812
01:07:50,024 --> 01:07:52,151
There's nothing for us here.

813
01:08:10,211 --> 01:08:12,963
It happened. It just happened.

814
01:08:13,047 --> 01:08:15,799
People make things happen.

815
01:08:15,884 --> 01:08:18,135
You think you're the only one
who's wanted someone young?

816
01:08:18,219 --> 01:08:21,138
Everyone sometimes,
everyone thinks about...

817
01:08:21,222 --> 01:08:23,766
But they deal with it!

818
01:08:24,309 --> 01:08:27,311
By the time I took my seat in the gods,

819
01:08:27,395 --> 01:08:30,522
the opera was well into its final act.

820
01:08:30,607 --> 01:08:33,025
- You're his teacher!
- And you were mine!

821
01:08:33,109 --> 01:08:35,986
I'm not justifying.
I'm not trying to justify it!

822
01:08:36,070 --> 01:08:37,821
You are so full of shit!

823
01:08:37,906 --> 01:08:40,908
It's totally different! You were 20.

824
01:08:41,326 --> 01:08:45,829
- He's 16 in May. He's not some innocent...
- Of course he's innocent!

825
01:08:45,914 --> 01:08:48,582
He's fucking 15!

826
01:08:48,666 --> 01:08:50,709
Are you insane?

827
01:08:50,794 --> 01:08:55,422
If you meant to destroy us, why not do it
with an adult? That's the convention.

828
01:08:55,507 --> 01:08:59,468
- It's worked for centuries.
- It wasn't about us. It...

829
01:08:59,552 --> 01:09:02,679
- Why?
- I just wanted him.

830
01:09:02,764 --> 01:09:05,432
- Why?
- I don't know!

831
01:09:05,683 --> 01:09:07,226
Well, find out!

832
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:30,415
- Sheba? And... No!
- Yep. Connolly, yes. Yes, honestly.

833
01:09:36,756 --> 01:09:39,883
My guilt is tempered with relief.

834
01:09:40,426 --> 01:09:45,013
She assumes the boy cracked
and told his mother all.

835
01:09:45,515 --> 01:09:47,891
Who am I to disabuse her?

836
01:09:48,518 --> 01:09:50,644
Oh, Brian. Brian.

837
01:09:50,728 --> 01:09:51,770
Brian.

838
01:09:51,855 --> 01:09:54,022
Brian, do stop a minute, please.

839
01:09:54,107 --> 01:09:56,441
Today, St George's School
is a solemn place.

840
01:09:56,526 --> 01:09:59,194
A source close to the school has indicated

841
01:09:59,279 --> 01:10:02,614
another member of staff
may have known of the relationship.

842
01:10:02,699 --> 01:10:07,619
This, however, is categorically denied
by the local authority.

843
01:10:07,704 --> 01:10:12,165
Had I known anything,
I would have informed you immediately.

844
01:10:12,250 --> 01:10:13,834
My loyalty is to the school.

845
01:10:13,918 --> 01:10:16,587
- Brian thinks you've known for months.
- Brian!

846
01:10:16,671 --> 01:10:20,090
- Then there is Sue...
- Will you run through the entire staff?

847
01:10:20,174 --> 01:10:23,927
If you knew and turned a blind eye,
you have enabled a crime.

848
01:10:24,012 --> 01:10:27,389
- I didn't, so I haven't.
- You're due for retirement next year.

849
01:10:27,473 --> 01:10:30,726
I think it would benefit everyone
if you take it early.

850
01:10:30,810 --> 01:10:33,520
So it's a witch hunt.
Salem comes to Islington.

851
01:10:33,605 --> 01:10:36,940
The stress of the job,
radical new ideas not to your taste...

852
01:10:37,025 --> 01:10:40,944
I've a radical idea. Your school,
your disaster. Why don't you resign?

853
01:10:41,029 --> 01:10:44,990
Because I am not the confidante
of a criminal!

854
01:10:45,825 --> 01:10:48,535
Now, tell me about your friendship
with Mrs. Hart.

855
01:10:48,620 --> 01:10:52,748
I think you'll find a close friendship
between consenting adults is legal,

856
01:10:52,832 --> 01:10:54,917
even under your regime.

857
01:10:55,168 --> 01:11:00,005
My record is beyond reproach. The majority
of the staff regard me as a moral guardian.

858
01:11:00,089 --> 01:11:06,053
I've just spoken to an ex-member
of our staff, another of your "close" friends.

859
01:11:06,930 --> 01:11:08,764
Jennifer Dodd.

860
01:11:11,017 --> 01:11:16,229
As you are aware, Jennifer became unwell.
That's why she had to leave the school.

861
01:11:16,314 --> 01:11:19,149
Jennifer threatened you
with a restraining order.

862
01:11:19,233 --> 01:11:21,360
That's nonsense.

863
01:11:22,528 --> 01:11:28,992
A fax from her solicitor. She didn't want
you within 500 yards of her by law!

864
01:11:29,077 --> 01:11:30,786
You call that a friendship?

865
01:11:30,995 --> 01:11:35,040
She told me that you sent her
fiancé a wreath!

866
01:11:38,211 --> 01:11:42,130
Now, we wouldn't want all this
to come out, would we?

867
01:11:42,215 --> 01:11:47,302
A lifetime of dedicated service
ending in shame and humiliation?

868
01:11:49,055 --> 01:11:51,682
It's your choice, Barbara.

869
01:12:58,666 --> 01:13:00,709
He knows it was me.

870
01:13:00,793 --> 01:13:03,754
Does she know, too?

871
01:13:03,838 --> 01:13:08,300
More than I can bear.
Is that why she's not returned my calls?

872
01:13:27,695 --> 01:13:31,031
Barbara, have you spoken
to Sheba Hart yet?

873
01:13:34,243 --> 01:13:40,499
- Why are you friends with a paedophile?
- Did you teach the boy at all?

874
01:13:40,583 --> 01:13:43,960
Barbara,
how's Sheba's husband taking all this?

875
01:13:44,212 --> 01:13:46,296
Barbarians.

876
01:13:48,591 --> 01:13:50,592
Sorry about your job.

877
01:13:50,843 --> 01:13:52,969
You see, the headmaster thought I knew.

878
01:13:53,846 --> 01:13:56,515
- Did you?
- No!

879
01:13:59,352 --> 01:14:01,436
Where is she?

880
01:14:01,521 --> 01:14:03,563
In her lair.

881
01:14:07,610 --> 01:14:10,320
Your boyfriend is younger than mine!

882
01:14:10,404 --> 01:14:11,988
He's not my boyfriend.

883
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:14,908
You slept with a child!

884
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:21,081
Oh, Jesus wept! The spectre at the feast.

885
01:14:21,165 --> 01:14:25,502
- You watch your tongue, madam.
- Frigging freak!

886
01:14:28,214 --> 01:14:30,674
Oh, there, there.

887
01:14:33,803 --> 01:14:35,887
Thanks for coming.

888
01:14:37,306 --> 01:14:39,891
I'm so sorry about school.

889
01:14:42,687 --> 01:14:45,272
Was he... Thank you. Was he awful to you?

890
01:14:52,947 --> 01:14:56,366
Listen, you could say no,
I'd completely understand,

891
01:14:56,450 --> 01:14:58,702
but Richard...

892
01:14:59,829 --> 01:15:04,624
He needs some time alone.
He's asked me to leave.

893
01:15:04,709 --> 01:15:08,753
Can I come and stay with you,
just for a few days?

894
01:15:11,257 --> 01:15:13,758
You're welcome for as long as you like.

895
01:15:24,896 --> 01:15:27,856
When's she coming out?

896
01:15:33,821 --> 01:15:36,114
Is Ben at school?

897
01:15:38,576 --> 01:15:40,619
Does he know what's happening?

898
01:15:41,370 --> 01:15:43,872
It's really none of your business.

899
01:15:45,583 --> 01:15:48,210
What about the kids?

900
01:16:10,191 --> 01:16:13,193
I knew who you were when we met.

901
01:16:14,487 --> 01:16:19,866
You were young, and I knew
it might get tough but I was prepared.

902
01:16:22,036 --> 01:16:26,998
You're a good mother, but at times
you've been a fucking lousy wife.

903
01:16:27,124 --> 01:16:29,292
Why didn't you come to me?

904
01:16:29,710 --> 01:16:32,671
You could have told me
how lonely you were.

905
01:16:32,755 --> 01:16:35,215
You never trusted me to help you.

906
01:16:35,925 --> 01:16:41,137
I'm not saying I was so fucking fabulous,
but I was here.

907
01:16:52,358 --> 01:16:55,193
There she is! There she is!

908
01:16:58,531 --> 01:17:03,868
This last month has been
the most delicious time of my life.

909
01:17:06,998 --> 01:17:10,208
Of course, we've had our ups and downs.

910
01:17:10,293 --> 01:17:15,797
The pressure is intense
when two women share their lives.

911
01:17:15,881 --> 01:17:20,719
But, oh, what marvelous intensity it is!

912
01:17:26,225 --> 01:17:28,310
It's the crone!

913
01:17:28,394 --> 01:17:31,771
- Barbara!
- Barbara! Barbara!

914
01:17:33,065 --> 01:17:34,816
Is Sheba coming out?

915
01:17:38,070 --> 01:17:41,281
Circumstances are not always ideal.

916
01:17:43,326 --> 01:17:45,452
The swinish press,

917
01:17:45,536 --> 01:17:48,580
the stringent bail terms,

918
01:17:48,664 --> 01:17:51,374
meetings with lawyers and so on.

919
01:17:51,459 --> 01:17:55,754
But all things considered,
we're coping admirably.

920
01:17:56,630 --> 01:18:00,383
In fact, gold stars abundant.

921
01:18:02,178 --> 01:18:07,682
The cuckold permits her
to see their children once a week.

922
01:18:07,933 --> 01:18:10,018
There are usually tears

923
01:18:10,102 --> 01:18:12,729
and fits of teenage tantrums, too.

924
01:18:14,357 --> 01:18:19,569
In time, she'll recognise
she's just not the mothering kind,

925
01:18:19,653 --> 01:18:22,822
and then Barbara will be there
to comfort her.

926
01:18:22,907 --> 01:18:26,242
Nurse, beloved friend,

927
01:18:26,327 --> 01:18:28,453
and wise counsel.

928
01:19:53,456 --> 01:19:55,123
The crone returneth!

929
01:19:55,207 --> 01:19:56,791
Were you pushed or did you jump?

930
01:19:56,876 --> 01:19:58,835
If you jumped, was it into a dyke?

931
01:19:58,919 --> 01:20:01,588
Is Sheba alive?
What have you done with her?

932
01:20:01,672 --> 01:20:05,467
How's the family
coping, Barbara?

933
01:20:05,718 --> 01:20:08,845
Barbara! Barbara! Barbara!

934
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:11,764
Sheba?

935
01:20:23,736 --> 01:20:26,654
What you say about me,

936
01:20:27,698 --> 01:20:30,450
about Richard...

937
01:20:32,036 --> 01:20:34,954
You're not fit to shine his shoes.

938
01:20:36,373 --> 01:20:38,458
And Ben and

939
01:20:39,502 --> 01:20:40,877
Polly,

940
01:20:40,961 --> 01:20:43,838
that I'd be happier without them?

941
01:20:49,011 --> 01:20:51,679
Why did you do it?

942
01:20:51,764 --> 01:20:54,516
Because I didn't help you collect your cat?

943
01:20:54,767 --> 01:20:56,851
You've cost me my family!

944
01:20:56,936 --> 01:20:59,145
Take some responsibility!

945
01:20:59,230 --> 01:21:05,485
I gave you exactly what you wanted. You'd
still be stuck in that marriage without me.

946
01:21:05,569 --> 01:21:07,487
- What?
- You can't accept it yet...

947
01:21:07,571 --> 01:21:11,699
- You think I wanted to be here with you?
- You need me! I'm your friend!

948
01:21:11,784 --> 01:21:14,702
You've put me in prison!
I could get two years!

949
01:21:14,787 --> 01:21:20,083
They'll fly by. I'll visit you every week.
We've so much life to live together.

950
01:21:20,167 --> 01:21:22,377
You think this is a love affair?

951
01:21:22,461 --> 01:21:24,337
A relationship?

952
01:21:24,421 --> 01:21:28,675
What, sticky gold stars
and a strand of my hair?

953
01:21:28,759 --> 01:21:31,386
And a receipt from Pizza Express?

954
01:21:31,470 --> 01:21:33,346
It's a flat in the Archway Road

955
01:21:33,430 --> 01:21:35,723
and you think you're
Virginia frigging Woolf!

956
01:21:35,808 --> 01:21:40,144
Where did you get my hair? Did you pluck it
from the bath with fucking tweezers?

957
01:21:40,229 --> 01:21:43,147
Don't you know it's rude
to read a person's diary?

958
01:21:43,232 --> 01:21:46,526
We're not companions. We're not friends.
You don't like me!

959
01:21:46,610 --> 01:21:51,155
That's not true. I only have
tender feelings for you, only love!

960
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:53,908
You're barking, fucking mad.
You don't know how to love.

961
01:21:54,159 --> 01:21:58,329
You have never your whole life.
Me, Jennifer Dodd...

962
01:21:58,414 --> 01:22:01,708
You're nothing but waste
and disappointment,

963
01:22:01,792 --> 01:22:04,002
you bitter old virgin!

964
01:22:04,086 --> 01:22:08,798
You're lonely for a reason.
They loathed you at school, all of them.

965
01:22:08,882 --> 01:22:13,136
I was the idiot who bothered, but only
because no one told me you're a vampire!

966
01:22:13,220 --> 01:22:16,598
So what is it, Bar?
You wanna roll around the floor like lovers?

967
01:22:16,682 --> 01:22:19,767
- You wanna fuck me?
- Please don't diminish our...

968
01:22:19,852 --> 01:22:22,812
- Our what? What?
- No! Give it back.

969
01:22:22,896 --> 01:22:28,026
I... I know you. Selfish and vain,
you think you have a divine right.

970
01:22:28,110 --> 01:22:32,030
You don't belong in the world,
you belong here! You big baby!

971
01:22:35,534 --> 01:22:43,750
Here I am!

972
01:23:25,084 --> 01:23:29,087
We never invited you
to the fucking Dordogne.

973
01:23:30,756 --> 01:23:35,343
I'm sorry, but you specifically said if I
happened to be in France I should drop in.

974
01:23:35,552 --> 01:23:37,762
We didn't mean it.

975
01:23:39,014 --> 01:23:41,099
Well, fine.

976
01:23:42,726 --> 01:23:44,977
I won't come, then.

977
01:23:46,438 --> 01:23:49,273
I asked you to lunch because I liked you.

978
01:23:50,401 --> 01:23:53,027
I would have been your friend.

979
01:24:00,869 --> 01:24:03,121
I need more than a friend.

980
01:26:21,385 --> 01:26:23,135
I knew her.

981
01:26:23,387 --> 01:26:25,429
Sorry?

982
01:26:25,639 --> 01:26:28,140
- I knew her.
- Really?

983
01:26:28,392 --> 01:26:29,725
Mm.

984
01:26:29,977 --> 01:26:33,312
- We taught at the same school.
- God.

985
01:26:33,772 --> 01:26:36,107
What was she like?

986
01:26:36,733 --> 01:26:38,609
A bit

987
01:26:39,194 --> 01:26:40,945
chilly.

988
01:26:42,239 --> 01:26:44,448
A touch furtive.

989
01:26:46,618 --> 01:26:49,036
A sort of absent person.

990
01:26:50,789 --> 01:26:53,708
Oh, but I didn't know her well. May I?

991
01:26:53,792 --> 01:26:55,877
Mm-hm.

992
01:27:01,758 --> 01:27:04,176
- Do you still teach?
- No, no.

993
01:27:05,095 --> 01:27:07,179
Retired.

994
01:27:08,265 --> 01:27:10,308
Thank goodness.

995
01:27:11,935 --> 01:27:14,812
- You...
- Oh.

996
01:27:15,564 --> 01:27:18,482
- Here.
- Thanks.

997
01:27:24,364 --> 01:27:27,033
- I love it here.
- Mm.

998
01:27:27,117 --> 01:27:30,161
It's spectacular at dusk.

999
01:27:35,876 --> 01:27:37,752
I'm Barbara.

1000
01:27:44,635 --> 01:27:46,177
Annabel.

1001
01:27:51,016 --> 01:27:54,185
I wonder, Annabel,

1002
01:27:54,269 --> 01:27:56,604
- do you like music?
- Oh, yes.

1003
01:27:56,688 --> 01:28:01,192
It's just that I've got tickets
for Handel's Water Music at the Albert Hall

1004
01:28:01,276 --> 01:28:02,443
on Saturday night.

1005
01:28:02,527 --> 01:28:05,112
You could bring a friend
if there's someone...

1006
01:28:05,364 --> 01:28:07,657
Oh, no. Oh, no. There isn't.

1007
01:28:07,741 --> 01:28:10,201
Well, there we are.
