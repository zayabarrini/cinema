00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:29,250
You know your stuff.

178
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:31,375
My mom was a nurse.

179
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,250
But first...

180
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:34,167
I have a ton of questions.

181
00:15:34,292 --> 00:15:35,667
Figures.

182
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:39,167
You said "worm." What did you mean?

183
00:15:39,292 --> 00:15:43,167
The worm is a giant force that dwells
beneath the Japanese islands.

184
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:44,750
It has no rhyme or reason.

185
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:47,583
Yet, it rages and shakes
the land if disturbed.

186
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:50,125
But you just beat it, right?

187
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,250
I only shut it away temporarily.

188
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:56,292
If we don't seal it with the
Keystone, it'll appear again.

189
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:59,167
You mean there'll be another earthquake?

190
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:02,042
It's my job to stop that from happening.

191
00:16:02,167 --> 00:16:03,417
Your job...

192
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,375
Hey, who exactly are yo...

193
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,667
Thanks for patching me up.

194
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,875
My name's Souta Munakata.

195
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,083
I-I'm Suzume Iwato.

196
00:16:19,042 --> 00:16:20,042
A cat...?

197
00:16:20,167 --> 00:16:22,833
Oh my gosh, this kitten's a toothpick.

198
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:25,125
One sec.

199
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:36,875
You must've been starving.

200
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:39,167
That earthquake was scary, huh?

201
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:42,500
So cute.

202
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:44,250
Want to become my cat?

203
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:45,333
Yeah.

204
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:50,542
Suzume... is kind.

205
00:16:50,667 --> 00:16:51,917
I like you.

206
00:16:53,917 --> 00:16:55,750
You... are in the way.

207
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:03,458
W-W-Whaaa...!?

208
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:05,500
Souta? Where are you?

209
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:15,916
What the...

210
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:17,125
...hell!?

211
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,583
Whaaaaa...!?

212
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:20,416
S-Souta?

213
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:22,333
Suzume...

214
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:23,791
What's happening?

215
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:27,708
Is this your doing!?

216
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:28,733
Come back here!

217
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:31,042
Dammit...!

218
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,292
What the...!?

219
00:17:41,667 --> 00:17:43,042
This can't be happening!

220
00:17:47,292 --> 00:17:48,250
No no no no!

221
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:49,275
Oh, Suzume.

222
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:50,275
Tamaki!

223
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:51,500
Sorry, stepping out!

224
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:53,042
Where are you going?

225
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,958
I came home early, worried about you.

226
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:56,983
The earthquake!?

227
00:17:57,042 --> 00:17:58,542
You didn't pick up your phone.

228
00:17:58,667 --> 00:17:59,958
Sorry! Missed it.

229
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:00,875
But, I'm okay.

230
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,042
H-Hey...

231
00:18:02,167 --> 00:18:04,417
Suzume! Answer me!

232
00:18:07,667 --> 00:18:08,917
Hey, a kitty!

233
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:21,042
What IS that?

234
00:18:21,167 --> 00:18:22,375
Excuse me!

235
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:26,667
What is even happening right now?

236
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,333
Hey, Suzume!

237
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:40,500
HEY!

238
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:41,750
Where...

239
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:43,167
...are you going!?

240
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:45,000
What the...!?

241
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,500
Ack!

242
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:54,792
I'm SO, SO sorry!

243
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:59,083
Thank you very much for your patience.

244
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:02,042
We have been given clearance to depart.

245
00:19:02,167 --> 00:19:04,500
We are now disembarking from the dock.

246
00:19:07,042 --> 00:19:08,000
Hey, did you see that?

247
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:09,625
- Yeah, I did.
- What the heck was that?

248
00:19:09,667 --> 00:19:10,250
A toy?

249
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:11,292
[NO PETS] You see that chair?

250
00:19:11,292 --> 00:19:12,333
[NO PETS] Very impressive.

251
00:19:12,792 --> 00:19:13,583
Where...

252
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:14,608
did you go!?

253
00:19:14,792 --> 00:19:16,583
My gosh...!

254
00:19:22,792 --> 00:19:24,167
Why do you run!?

255
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:26,333
What did you do to me!?

256
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,083
What are you!?

257
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:29,667
Answer me!

258
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:35,900
Oh no!

259
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:37,900
Suzume!

260
00:19:38,667 --> 00:19:39,667
See you.

261
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:45,917
Whaaaaat!?

262
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,792
Like I said...

263
00:19:54,917 --> 00:19:56,417
I'm spending the night at Aya's.

264
00:19:57,792 --> 00:19:58,542
I'm sorry.

265
00:19:58,667 --> 00:19:59,875
I'll be home tomorrow.

266
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,917
Now wait just one moment, Suzume.

267
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:04,667
You can stay over,

268
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:07,125
but why is the first aid kit in your room?

269
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,167
Did you have someone over?

270
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,500
I don't even want to think about it, but...

271
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:14,583
Are you seeing some good-for-noth...!

272
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:15,208
NO!

273
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:16,833
No boys! I'm hanging up!

274
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,750
Did you see that runnin' chair, missy?

275
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:26,775
No.

276
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:37,833
Souta.

277
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:40,167
This ship will reach Ehime by morning.

278
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:43,333
Looks like the cat's
ship is heading there too.

279
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:44,500
I see.

280
00:20:44,917 --> 00:20:46,583
I got some bread.

281
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:47,750
Thanks.

282
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:50,208
But I'm not hungry.

283
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:51,333
Okay.

284
00:20:57,583 --> 00:20:59,833
Um, why are you a chair?

285
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:03,250
Apparently, that cat placed a curse on me.

286
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:04,625
A curse!?

287
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:05,417
Are you okay?

288
00:21:05,542 --> 00:21:07,667
Does it hurt?

289
00:21:07,792 --> 00:21:09,292
I'm fine.

290
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,875
You're warm.

291
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,042
Still, I have to figure this out.

292
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:20,333
Souta, there's something bothering me.

293
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:23,000
A relic in the ruins...?

294
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:24,417
That's the Keystone!

295
00:21:24,542 --> 00:21:25,542
You removed it?

296
00:21:25,667 --> 00:21:27,708
Removed...?

297
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:28,750
Of course...

298
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:30,750
That cat is the Keystone!

299
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:32,875
How dare it leave its post.

300
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,458
What do you mean?

301
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:38,083
You set the Keystone
free, and now it's cursed me.

302
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:39,333
Oh no...

303
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:41,167
I'm so sorry, I...

304
00:21:41,917 --> 00:21:43,458
What should I do?

305
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:47,167
No.

306
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:50,625
It's my fault for not
finding the door sooner.

307
00:21:50,792 --> 00:21:51,875
This isn't on you.

308
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,667
But...

309
00:21:52,792 --> 00:21:55,375
Suzume, I'm a Closer.

310
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,667
A "Closer"?

311
00:21:57,125 --> 00:22:01,250
I close the open doors so
that disaster won't spread.

312
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:04,083
I travel across Japan doing that.

313
00:22:04,792 --> 00:22:07,917
It's our job as Closers.

314
00:22:08,667 --> 00:22:10,000
You're hungry, right?

315
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:11,375
Eat up.

316
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:19,958
We must turn the Keystone
back and banish the worm.

317
00:22:20,083 --> 00:22:23,625
Surely then, I'll return to my body.

318
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:26,917
So, don't worry.

319
00:22:27,667 --> 00:22:30,667
Tomorrow, you're going home.

320
00:22:42,292 --> 00:22:43,667
Mommy?

321
00:22:45,917 --> 00:22:47,583
Mommy!

322
00:22:49,208 --> 00:22:50,542
Mommy!!

323
00:22:50,667 --> 00:22:52,250
Where are you!?

324
00:23:14,125 --> 00:23:15,833
Souta?

325
00:23:16,542 --> 00:23:18,417
Do you always sleep like that?

326
00:23:32,625 --> 00:23:34,125
My heart's pounding.

327
00:23:35,333 --> 00:23:37,917
Thank you very much for riding
the Shikoku Orange Ferry today.

328
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,667
- Man it's hot.
- Finally!

329
00:23:39,708 --> 00:23:41,542
- You're goin' to Osaka?
- It's been a while.

330
00:23:41,625 --> 00:23:43,708
Yeah, but I'll spend the night somewhere.

331
00:23:43,792 --> 00:23:46,625
On behalf of the entire crew,
we hope to see you again.

332
00:23:46,708 --> 00:23:47,917
Suzume?

333
00:23:49,792 --> 00:23:51,750
Finally, you are up!

334
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:54,250
You wouldn't wake up,

335
00:23:54,375 --> 00:23:57,292
I was beginning to think
this was all a dream.

336
00:23:57,417 --> 00:23:59,458
I was asleep?

337
00:23:59,583 --> 00:24:01,208
Never mind.

338
00:24:01,333 --> 00:24:03,542
Now, how do we find that cat?

339
00:24:03,667 --> 00:24:05,750
We should ask around the harbor first.

340
00:24:06,292 --> 00:24:07,500
But where are we?

341
00:24:07,625 --> 00:24:08,750
Hey, you!

342
00:24:08,917 --> 00:24:10,292
It looks like...

343
00:24:10,417 --> 00:24:11,583
the edge of Ehime?

344
00:24:11,708 --> 00:24:13,083
Wow, we came a long way.

345
00:24:13,208 --> 00:24:16,667
Get on the next ferry, and
you can make it home tonight.

346
00:24:16,792 --> 00:24:18,125
- You should...
- Oh no!

347
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:18,750

Wh-Wh-Whoa...!

860
00:48:36,958 --> 00:48:37,875
Wait!

861
00:48:41,708 --> 00:48:42,608
Seriously!?

862
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,250
Mom...?

863
00:49:09,333 --> 00:49:11,750
Become the Keystone, and seal that worm!

864
00:49:12,375 --> 00:49:14,875
The Eastern Pillar alone will not hold.

865
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:15,458
Can't...

866
00:49:15,583 --> 00:49:16,333
Why!?

867
00:49:16,458 --> 00:49:18,500
I've entrusted this duty to you.

868
00:49:18,625 --> 00:49:20,083
What does that mean?

869
00:49:20,208 --> 00:49:21,500
You go away.

870
00:49:22,083 --> 00:49:24,250
Daijin's gonna play with Suzume.

871
00:49:24,583 --> 00:49:26,083
With Suzume?

872
00:49:30,542 --> 00:49:31,500
Suzume!

873
00:49:31,917 --> 00:49:33,500
What happened, Suzume!?

874
00:49:34,250 --> 00:49:35,150
What's going on?

875
00:49:35,375 --> 00:49:36,750
What do you see?

876
00:49:39,292 --> 00:49:41,083
Suzume!? Come back.

877
00:49:41,208 --> 00:49:42,250
You mustn't go in!

878
00:49:43,125 --> 00:49:44,250
Suzume!

879
00:49:53,250 --> 00:49:56,208
Suzume, you're inside a Ferris wheel!

880
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:00,208
Wake up! You're going to fall!

881
00:50:00,458 --> 00:50:01,375
Dammit.

882
00:50:01,667 --> 00:50:03,667
O Divine Gods who
dwell beneath this land...

883
00:50:06,667 --> 00:50:09,250
You have long protected
us for generations...

884
00:50:10,333 --> 00:50:13,292
Thy mountains and rivers...

885
00:50:13,417 --> 00:50:15,292
that we have long called our own...

886
00:50:15,375 --> 00:50:16,958
- (Whoa, it's so high up!)
- that we have long called our own...

887
00:50:16,958 --> 00:50:18,000
- (Cool!)
- that we have long called our own...

888
00:50:18,042 --> 00:50:19,242
(Don't have too much fun now.)

889
00:50:19,292 --> 00:50:20,812
(We should come here again, together!)

890
00:50:21,625 --> 00:50:23,708
(This is our anniversary. Let's come back.)

891
00:50:23,833 --> 00:50:27,542
(An amusement park on
our first date is so cliché!)

892
00:50:28,833 --> 00:50:31,458
(Daddy, let's come back again!)

893
00:50:33,958 --> 00:50:36,000
Suzume! Come!

894
00:50:36,583 --> 00:50:37,750
Souta?

895
00:50:50,167 --> 00:50:52,792
O Divine Gods who
dwell beneath this land...

896
00:50:52,917 --> 00:50:55,167
You have long protected
us for generations...

897
00:50:55,542 --> 00:50:58,250
Thy mountains and rivers...

898
00:50:59,125 --> 00:51:03,500
that we have long called our own...

899
00:51:03,667 --> 00:51:04,567
Now!

900
00:51:04,708 --> 00:51:06,333
I return to you!

901
00:51:17,708 --> 00:51:19,000
Where's Daijin?

902
00:51:19,417 --> 00:51:21,000
Gone. Again.

903
00:51:25,083 --> 00:51:26,042
Let's go inside.

904
00:51:29,625 --> 00:51:30,750
What's wrong?

905
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,208
I was so scared!

906
00:51:35,625 --> 00:51:37,125
You were amazing.

907
00:51:37,250 --> 00:51:38,500
Thank you.

908
00:51:42,375 --> 00:51:43,500
Suzume...

909
00:51:43,625 --> 00:51:46,625
What were you looking at, beyond the Gate?

910
00:51:48,458 --> 00:51:51,875
A bright night sky filled
with stars and fields...

911
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,417
The Ever-After.

912
00:51:53,542 --> 00:51:55,458
So you can see it...!?

913
00:51:55,875 --> 00:51:56,775
"Ever-After"?

914
00:51:56,833 --> 00:51:59,542
This world's other half,
where the worm dwells.

915
00:51:59,667 --> 00:52:02,167
And, where all time exists simultaneously.

916
00:52:02,333 --> 00:52:04,208
I could see it, but I couldn't go in.

917
00:52:04,875 --> 00:52:07,958
The Ever-After is
where all souls go to rest.

918
00:52:09,167 --> 00:52:12,125
It's not somewhere the living can reach.

919
00:52:12,708 --> 00:52:14,917
Not a place we're supposed to go.

920
00:52:16,708 --> 00:52:18,750
The troublemaker's back.

921
00:52:19,458 --> 00:52:21,792
Suzume, where were you!?

922
00:52:21,917 --> 00:52:23,708
Oh, um... I'm sorry.

923
00:52:23,833 --> 00:52:26,417
You had me worried sick!
Running off at this hour.

924
00:52:26,542 --> 00:52:28,250
Well, she's all right, isn't she?

925
00:52:28,375 --> 00:52:29,625
But...!

926
00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:32,167
How many times have we run away from home?

927
00:52:36,292 --> 00:52:38,625
Why don't we have a bite for now.

928
00:52:38,750 --> 00:52:40,083
Sorry...

929
00:52:40,875 --> 00:52:42,167
How about fried udon?

930
00:52:42,292 --> 00:52:44,042
Yeah! With a sunny side up on top.

931
00:52:44,167 --> 00:52:45,250
And tuna-mayo!

932
00:52:45,375 --> 00:52:45,792
Yeah.

933
00:52:45,917 --> 00:52:46,875
And you, Suzume?

934
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,958
We actually put potato salad on top.

935
00:52:49,083 --> 00:52:50,958
- Say what?
- On fried udon?

936
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:54,083
O-M-G.

937
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,875
Think about the calories.

938
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,458
Sooo hungry.

939
00:52:58,958 --> 00:53:00,208
Thanks for the meal!

940
00:53:04,208 --> 00:53:05,625
Delish!

941
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:06,792
I'll gain some weight.

942
00:53:06,917 --> 00:53:07,817
Needs a beer!

943
00:53:08,042 --> 00:53:08,942
Should we?

944
00:53:09,208 --> 00:53:10,792
After drinking all night?

945
00:53:11,083 --> 00:53:11,983
Sure, why not?

946
00:53:12,125 --> 00:53:13,625
Join us, Souta.

947
00:53:13,750 --> 00:53:15,708
Didn't expect the potato salad, though.

948
00:53:15,833 --> 00:53:17,208
- H-Hey!
- I'm making this for my boyfriend.

949
00:53:17,250 --> 00:53:18,708
What boyfriend?

950
00:53:18,833 --> 00:53:20,208
I'll have one in no time.

951
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:21,917
What's with that chair?

952
00:53:22,042 --> 00:53:23,083
Adorable.

953
00:53:23,208 --> 00:53:24,108
A kid's chair?

954
00:53:24,208 --> 00:53:25,542
Why are you on it?

955
00:53:25,667 --> 00:53:26,750
A Kobe souvenir...?

956
00:53:26,875 --> 00:53:28,458
You're not making any sense.

957
00:53:34,375 --> 00:53:36,208
They must've thought you were weird.

958
00:53:36,458 --> 00:53:37,792
Really?

959
00:53:37,958 --> 00:53:41,208
Do you travel like this all the time?

960
00:53:41,708 --> 00:53:42,708
Not all the time.

961
00:53:42,917 --> 00:53:44,292
I have a flat in Tokyo.

962
00:53:45,167 --> 00:53:48,375
After college, I plan to be a teacher.

963
00:53:49,583 --> 00:53:51,458
What!? You're a university student?

964
00:53:51,708 --> 00:53:52,608
Yeah?

965
00:53:52,708 --> 00:53:53,500
And... a job!?

966
00:53:53,625 --> 00:53:54,875
What about THIS job!?

967
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,250
Being a Closer has been
in my family for generations.

968
00:53:58,375 --> 00:53:59,583
I'll continue that.

969
00:54:00,417 --> 00:54:02,333
But it doesn't put food on the table.

970
00:54:02,458 --> 00:54:03,750
I see...

971
00:54:04,375 --> 00:54:05,708
But it's an important job.

972
00:54:06,167 --> 00:54:09,833
Most important jobs, people shouldn't see.

973
00:54:10,375 --> 00:54:12,458
I need to get back into my own body.

974
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:15,625
So I can continue this
and become a teacher.

975
00:54:20,167 --> 00:54:21,792
But... I'm already...

976
00:54:27,667 --> 00:54:29,042
Perhaps, I'm...

977
00:54:30,083 --> 00:54:32,500
already...

978
00:54:39,458 --> 00:54:41,292
It's getting farther.

979
00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:43,542
The light grows dimmer.

980
00:54:43,750 --> 00:54:45,417
And so do the voices.

981
00:54:45,708 --> 00:54:47,333
My body...

982
00:54:47,750 --> 00:54:49,208
My mind...

983
00:54:50,958 --> 00:54:52,125
It's so...

984
00:54:52,375 --> 00:54:53,292
Cold.

985
00:54:53,625 --> 00:54:54,583
I'm so cold.

986
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:57,250
Cold...

987
00:55:12,750 --> 00:55:13,792
Am I...

988
00:55:25,833 --> 00:55:27,167
Is this where...

989
00:55:27,375 --> 00:55:28,917
I meet my end?

990
00:55:37,958 --> 00:55:39,375
Souta?

991
00:55:40,333 --> 00:55:41,667
Souta!?

992
00:55:48,083 --> 00:55:48,983
Good morning.

993
00:55:49,042 --> 00:55:50,375
Took you long enough.

994
00:55:50,542 --> 00:55:53,458
Hey, there's another photo of Daijin.

995
00:55:54,208 --> 00:55:55,250
See?

996
00:55:56,208 --> 00:55:57,375
Suzume.

997
00:55:58,417 --> 00:55:59,317
Did...

998
00:55:59,583 --> 00:56:01,250
Did you just do something to me?

999
00:56:01,708 --> 00:56:02,750
Nope.

1000
00:56:03,833 --> 00:56:08,458
- The Chugoku Expressway south towards Okayama...
- I was counting on you to help me at the bar tonight, too.

1001
00:56:09,792 --> 00:56:11,667
Here, this is for you.

1002
00:56:12,458 --> 00:56:15,292
You look even more
like a runaway child now.

1003
00:56:16,167 --> 00:56:18,792
Rumi, thank you so much for everything.

1004
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:20,208
Mmhmm.

1005
00:56:20,750 --> 00:56:23,458
Just be sure to send word to your guardian.

1006
00:56:23,583 --> 00:56:24,483
I will.

1007
00:56:24,792 --> 00:56:25,458
Ah, crap!

1008
00:56:25,625 --> 00:56:27,458
I totally forgot about Tamaki.

1009
00:56:27,958 --> 00:56:28,958
55... unread messages?

1010
00:56:29,375 --> 00:56:30,625
She's coming to get me?

1011
00:56:30,750 --> 00:56:32,708
Suzume, you can make the next train.

1012
00:56:32,833 --> 00:56:34,708
Buy a ticket. Hurry!

1013
00:56:34,917 --> 00:56:36,750
The bullet train?

1014
00:56:36,875 --> 00:56:39,708
We know where Daijin is, so...

1015
00:56:39,917 --> 00:56:41,500
It's the quickest way, right?

1016
00:56:41,625 --> 00:56:42,875
To Tokyo, though?

1017
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,708
That'll take all my savings.

1018
00:56:45,042 --> 00:56:47,625
You better pay me back, Mr. College Man.

1019
00:56:47,792 --> 00:56:49,125
I gotcha.

1020
00:56:50,208 --> 00:56:51,958
Souta, look!

1021
00:56:52,292 --> 00:56:53,192
What is it?

1022
00:56:53,792 --> 00:56:55,583
This train is SO fast.

1023
00:56:55,875 --> 00:56:57,042
Cool!

1024
00:56:57,167 --> 00:56:58,292
Yeah... it's fast.

1025
00:56:58,542 --> 00:57:01,542
We will soon arrive at
Atami. The doors on the...

1026
00:57:02,708 --> 00:57:04,708
Souta, did we just...

1027
00:57:04,833 --> 00:57:05,750
What's wrong?

1028

01:16:39,875 --> 01:16:42,625
I wanted nothing more than to go myself...

1370
01:16:42,750 --> 01:16:46,875
but this old body of mine wouldn't listen.

1371
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:51,333
That's why I want to know
how to enter the Ever-After.

1372
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:54,500
Why?

1373
01:16:54,792 --> 01:16:56,958
Huh? Because... we have to save Souta!

1374
01:16:57,083 --> 01:16:58,917
That isn't necessary.

1375
01:16:59,042 --> 01:16:59,958
What?

1376
01:17:00,083 --> 01:17:03,458
Souta will spend decades now

1377
01:17:03,583 --> 01:17:07,125
as a Keystone housing the gods.

1378
01:17:07,250 --> 01:17:10,750
He is no longer of our realm.

1379
01:17:10,958 --> 01:17:12,208
How could...

1380
01:17:12,333 --> 01:17:13,500
But there must be a way to...

1381
01:17:13,625 --> 01:17:17,500
Are you trying to waste
my grandson's sacrifice?

1382
01:17:17,625 --> 01:17:18,525
What?

1383
01:17:18,583 --> 01:17:21,417
Who is the one who pierced the worm?

1384
01:17:21,667 --> 01:17:23,833
Did you, with Souta?

1385
01:17:23,958 --> 01:17:24,667
But that was...

1386
01:17:24,792 --> 01:17:26,000
ANSWER ME!

1387
01:17:26,125 --> 01:17:27,025
It was me!

1388
01:17:27,375 --> 01:17:28,667
I see.

1389
01:17:28,792 --> 01:17:30,417
That's fine!

1390
01:17:30,542 --> 01:17:33,833
If you didn't, millions would have died!

1391
01:17:33,958 --> 01:17:36,958
Take pride in your deed,
keep your mouth shut,

1392
01:17:37,083 --> 01:17:39,875
and return to whence you came!

1393
01:17:45,250 --> 01:17:49,583
This world is not for the ordinary.

1394
01:17:49,750 --> 01:17:52,708
Forget everything that happened.

1395
01:17:53,458 --> 01:17:55,375
How could I forget?

1396
01:17:55,500 --> 01:17:58,292
I'll open the underground Gate again.

1397
01:17:58,417 --> 01:18:00,625
What!? What are you saying?

1398
01:18:00,750 --> 01:18:02,250
I have to get in!

1399
01:18:02,375 --> 01:18:03,275
Impossible.

1400
01:18:03,333 --> 01:18:04,958
You cannot enter it there!

1401
01:18:05,083 --> 01:18:07,208
You mustn't open the Gate!

1402
01:18:07,333 --> 01:18:08,458
Wait!

1403
01:18:20,542 --> 01:18:23,000
The Ever-After is a beautiful place.

1404
01:18:23,125 --> 01:18:25,125
But it is the domain of the departed.

1405
01:18:25,417 --> 01:18:28,375
Does that not scare you?

1406
01:18:28,708 --> 01:18:30,208
It doesn't.

1407
01:18:30,500 --> 01:18:33,250
Whether one lives or
dies is a matter of luck.

1408
01:18:33,375 --> 01:18:35,000
I've always felt that way.

1409
01:18:35,458 --> 01:18:36,358
But...

1410
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:40,542
I'm afraid of a world without Souta.

1411
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:54,208
There is but one Gate through which
people may traverse in their lifetime.

1412
01:18:54,583 --> 01:18:57,250
You've been to the Ever-After before, no?

1413
01:18:57,667 --> 01:19:00,125
What did you see there?

1414
01:19:00,625 --> 01:19:02,000
That was...

1415
01:19:02,250 --> 01:19:04,000
A young version of myself.

1416
01:19:04,500 --> 01:19:07,667
And, my mom... who passed away.

1417
01:19:08,083 --> 01:19:14,250
I suspect you got lost in the
Ever-After when you were young.

1418
01:19:20,417 --> 01:19:24,750
You must find THAT Gate. From back then.

1419
01:19:35,250 --> 01:19:37,792
It has been far too long.

1420

1430
01:20:57,333 --> 01:20:58,708
To find a door.

Is this the guy who came to our house?

1451
01:21:30,250 --> 01:21:32,167
