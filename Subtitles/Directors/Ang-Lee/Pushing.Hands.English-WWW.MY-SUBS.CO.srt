1
00:07:11,751 --> 00:07:14,812
Jesus, oh!

2
00:07:17,324 --> 00:07:19,155
Oh God

3
00:07:21,628 --> 00:07:24,154
No metal in the microwave

4
00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:25,859
No metal!

5
00:09:43,925 --> 00:09:45,449
Martha, it's Robert

6
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,418
Just to let you know to keep an eye peeled

7
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:51,558
for the first reviews of
your breathlessly awaited first novel

8
00:09:51,834 --> 00:09:54,860
Word is, the Times is going to rave, rave, rave

9
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:56,132
Talk to you soon

10
00:11:51,136 --> 00:11:52,296
Thanks

11
00:12:01,414 --> 00:12:02,381
You look like shit

12
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:04,042
Where's Grandpa?

13
00:12:05,686 --> 00:12:07,677
He's so cute with the headphones on

14
00:12:08,022 --> 00:12:11,356
Hi Grandpa!

15
00:12:12,961 --> 00:12:15,020
Do you think he remembers me?

16
00:12:16,064 --> 00:12:17,999
Come on, it's a steal. You've got to see it.

17
00:12:18,034 --> 00:12:19,228
You'll have your own room to write in

18
00:12:19,268 --> 00:12:22,601
Grandpa can be out in the back chopping
bricks or whatever he does out there

19
00:12:22,638 --> 00:12:24,038
You'd never even know he existed

20
00:12:24,074 --> 00:12:25,006
I wish he didn't

21
00:12:25,109 --> 00:12:27,009
God, he's really getting you down

22
00:12:27,411 --> 00:12:29,276
From the way Alex has acted
for the last seven years

23
00:12:29,313 --> 00:12:30,746
you'd have thought he didn't have a father

24
00:12:30,781 --> 00:12:33,114
And then boom, a month ago
this shows up on the doorstep

25
00:12:33,385 --> 00:12:34,579
I haven't written a word since

26
00:12:34,986 --> 00:12:36,783
Well, Alex has got to get him out of here

27
00:12:37,155 --> 00:12:38,623
It's not that simple with Alex

28
00:12:38,657 --> 00:12:40,682
and frankly we can't afford
to get him his own place

29
00:12:40,993 --> 00:12:42,392
let alone buy a mansion

30
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:43,687
Of course you can

31
00:12:43,729 --> 00:12:45,664
especially if your mother's offer
is still good

32
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:48,100
Alex will never accept money from her
you know that

33
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:49,493
Work on him!

34
00:12:49,536 --> 00:12:52,301
For God sakes, Martha
you have a lot to learn about men

35
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:54,274
And you have a lot to learn about husbands

36
00:12:56,044 --> 00:12:56,635
Sorry

37
00:12:57,111 --> 00:12:59,603
It's okay. I'm getting a dog.

38
00:14:13,165 --> 00:14:14,154
Hi Alex!

39
00:14:16,603 --> 00:14:18,161
Smells good. Good Jimmy boy.

40
00:14:19,105 --> 00:14:20,572
Grandpa, I'm home

41
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,868
How's my boy!

42
00:14:24,478 --> 00:14:25,502
What's that?

43
00:14:25,746 --> 00:14:27,407
It's a book that I made for you

44
00:14:28,215 --> 00:14:29,648
Animals that change

45
00:14:31,586 --> 00:14:32,245
One day

46
00:14:32,287 --> 00:14:34,915
I saw the most weird thing

47
00:14:35,357 --> 00:14:38,850
It was a turtle and a fish and a rat

48
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:42,927
They were in a puddle of potion

49
00:14:44,167 --> 00:14:45,294
They grew

50
00:14:47,171 --> 00:14:50,197
They destroyed the universe. The end.

51
00:14:54,145 --> 00:14:55,772
Where does he get these ideas?

52
00:14:56,581 --> 00:14:58,641
Come on. Let's go get you
cleaned up for dinner

53
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:04,947
Dad, you shouldn't eat so much fat
at your age

54
00:15:06,893 --> 00:15:08,258
How are you today?

55
00:15:08,295 --> 00:15:09,592
Did you watch those tapes I rented for you?

56
00:15:09,629 --> 00:15:10,186
Terrible!

57
00:15:11,198 --> 00:15:12,392
I'll get you some Taiwanese tapes

58
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,692
They'll be just as bad

59
00:15:14,502 --> 00:15:16,197
Well, what about some Hong Kong kung-fu movies?

60
00:15:16,237 --> 00:15:17,226
The worst!

61
00:15:17,271 --> 00:15:19,398
Their kung-fu's a joke

62
00:15:20,409 --> 00:15:21,671
Dad! They're only acting

63
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:23,837
You're a Tai Chi professor
They can't compare

64
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:27,347
Damn, I can't learn English

65
00:15:28,251 --> 00:15:30,276
It's a disgrace to go back

66
00:15:31,287 --> 00:15:32,311
My life is going nowhere

67
00:15:33,991 --> 00:15:34,616
Dad

68
00:15:35,359 --> 00:15:37,190
It hasn't even been a month
since you retired and came to America

69
00:15:38,295 --> 00:15:39,421
Give yourself some time

70
00:15:48,841 --> 00:15:51,833
Jeremy come here
Come here you little rascal

71
00:15:52,345 --> 00:15:53,243
Come here

72
00:15:55,983 --> 00:15:57,883
Come here, Jeremy. Get off the couch

73
00:15:59,219 --> 00:16:01,278
I don't have time for this, come here

74
00:16:04,292 --> 00:16:05,623
Whoa!

75
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:08,026
My precious young man running bare naked!

76
00:16:09,565 --> 00:16:11,396
Let me see!

77
00:16:11,433 --> 00:16:12,900
The future of the Chu family
is depending on your little treasure

78
00:16:12,935 --> 00:16:14,334
What does he think he's doing?

79
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:14,961
That's all right

80
00:16:15,004 --> 00:16:17,269
Chinese elders must always
reassure themselves

81
00:16:17,307 --> 00:16:18,672
that their family name will go on

82
00:16:19,743 --> 00:16:21,711
Come on Jeremy, upstairs with you!

83
00:16:24,315 --> 00:16:25,304
She's afraid he'll catch cold

84
00:16:25,816 --> 00:16:27,340
Kids aren't made out of paper

85
00:16:46,874 --> 00:16:47,636
Thanks

86
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:52,605
Thanks

87
00:16:55,283 --> 00:16:56,648
No, thanks

88
00:16:58,554 --> 00:17:01,580
Why does this American woman
only eat vegetables?

89
00:17:02,758 --> 00:17:03,782
She's afraid of getting fat

90
00:17:04,293 --> 00:17:05,318
Why am I not fat?

91
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:08,364
On this Earth, there are two kinds of food

92
00:17:08,398 --> 00:17:12,392
Cereal and vegetables are 'yin'

93
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:15,969
and meat is 'yang'

94
00:17:16,507 --> 00:17:18,634
You must eat both to be balanced

95
00:17:18,676 --> 00:17:20,702
and to be healthy

96
00:17:20,746 --> 00:17:22,509
Alex, Linda came over today

97
00:17:22,548 --> 00:17:23,344
Great

98
00:17:23,882 --> 00:17:24,906
What's that supposed to mean?

99
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:26,350
Just great

100
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:28,952
What exactly do you have against her anyway?

101
00:17:29,356 --> 00:17:31,415
So what if she was a Maoist in college?

102
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:34,292
From Maoist revolutionary
to real estate baron

103
00:17:34,328 --> 00:17:36,558
If there's one thing worse
than a communist

104
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:39,031
it's an ex-communist
who's become a capitalist

105
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,369
Well, she's ready to do us quite a big favor

106
00:17:41,403 --> 00:17:44,395
Oh no. She's trying to sell us
a house again

107
00:17:44,439 --> 00:17:46,634
What's she mumbling about? Nothing

108
00:17:47,008 --> 00:17:48,408
Something about cigarette butts?

109
00:17:48,911 --> 00:17:49,468
What?

110
00:17:50,046 --> 00:17:51,980
Mommy said she wants to move out

111
00:17:52,014 --> 00:17:52,605
Quiet!

112
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:55,113
Alex, I'm talking to you

113
00:17:55,152 --> 00:17:56,847
Mommy, can I watch cartoons?

114
00:17:57,454 --> 00:17:58,443
Here

115
00:17:58,822 --> 00:17:59,948
put some meat on your bones!

116
00:18:00,491 --> 00:18:01,516
I don't want it, thank you

117
00:18:01,593 --> 00:18:03,458
Jeremy, finish your milk
and you can watch TV

118
00:18:04,396 --> 00:18:04,885
What did she say?

119
00:18:06,097 --> 00:18:07,655
If he finishes his milk, he can watch TV

120
00:18:20,547 --> 00:18:22,014
American people teach children

121
00:18:22,048 --> 00:18:24,916
everything's a deal, like doing business

122
00:18:24,952 --> 00:18:26,442
You should at least
take a look at the photos

123
00:18:26,487 --> 00:18:29,514
It's apparently a real steal
If children can't concentrate on eating

124
00:18:29,558 --> 00:18:31,549
what else can they concentrate on?
No, I don't want to look at any photos

125
00:18:31,593 --> 00:18:32,582
Yes, father

126
00:18:33,095 --> 00:18:34,653
And, these American cartoons

127
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:36,961
are only adding weirdness and violence

128
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,865
to this messed up world
Can I talk to you for five minutes?

129
00:18:39,002 --> 00:18:42,403
For children? It's just a mess

130
00:18:42,439 --> 00:18:46,740
Our sages said... Dad, eat!

131
00:18:52,517 --> 00:18:54,508
Don't get upset. I'm just afraid
your dinner's getting cold

132
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:56,751
What has he been babbling about?

133
00:18:56,788 --> 00:18:58,723
The violence in cartoons

134
00:18:59,225 --> 00:19:01,386
How can he complain
he's martial arts expert himself

135
00:19:01,427 --> 00:19:02,519
isn't that violence enough?

136
00:19:02,762 --> 00:19:03,751
Would you cut it out? Both of you!

137
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:08,534
Just eat

138
00:19:23,719 --> 00:19:26,518
You finish up. I'm going out for a smoke

139
00:20:13,776 --> 00:20:17,042
In America, you're so polite to kids
You think so?

140
00:20:17,648 --> 00:20:21,209
You don't treat kids as kids

141
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:24,549
It's not so simple

142
00:20:24,589 --> 00:20:25,817
It's called democracy

143
00:20:25,857 --> 00:20:28,018
No big and no little

144
00:20:28,126 --> 00:20:31,096
I see, you understand America
better than me

145
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:35,966
Chinese time

146
00:20:42,642 --> 00:20:44,201
Jeremy, stop playing

147
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,704
Come on, time for homework

148
00:21:02,565 --> 00:21:03,532
Alex

149
00:21:03,566 --> 00:21:05,762
The teachers' Putonghua is poor

150
00:21:05,803 --> 00:21:07,737
Is his Chinese school any good?

151
00:21:08,606 --> 00:21:10,870
Don't be too picky!

152
00:21:11,276 --> 00:21:13,073
We only have one Chinese school
around here

153
00:21:13,111 --> 00:21:15,045
Every weekend Jeremy learns some Chinese

154
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,172
I can play basketball

155
00:21:16,214 --> 00:21:17,545
and you get to teach Tai Chi

156
00:21:17,582 --> 00:21:19,141
Thank God for it!

157
00:21:19,652 --> 00:21:21,847
Let's follow what they teach

158
00:21:21,887 --> 00:21:23,582
Eh! Not like that

159
00:21:26,727 --> 00:21:28,922
Dad, I've got some things
to take care of

160
00:21:30,631 --> 00:21:32,293
Jeremy, come on

161
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:34,927
Grandpa will teach you an old Chinese rhyme

162
00:21:34,969 --> 00:21:37,631
On East West Street, North South Go

163
00:21:37,672 --> 00:21:39,937
Outside the gate, a man bites a dog!

164
00:21:39,975 --> 00:21:42,000
Grab the dog to hit a brick

165
00:21:42,044 --> 00:21:44,012
Watch out that brick might bite the hand

166
00:21:44,046 --> 00:21:45,707
Follow Grandpa

167
00:21:45,748 --> 00:21:47,842
On East West Street

168
00:21:47,884 --> 00:21:49,681
North South Go

169
00:21:49,719 --> 00:21:51,687
Outside the gate a man bites a dog

170
00:21:51,721 --> 00:21:54,350
Outside the gate a dog bites a man

171
00:21:54,692 --> 00:21:57,286
a man bites a dog!

172
00:21:59,363 --> 00:22:00,331
a man bites a dog!

173
00:22:24,726 --> 00:22:25,715
Shit

174
00:23:06,474 --> 00:23:07,873
Just one more sentence

175
00:23:16,318 --> 00:23:17,046
Okay

176
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:27,053
How's your computer virus?

177
00:23:27,731 --> 00:23:28,823
Almost killed

178
00:23:33,304 --> 00:23:35,795
And when can I start reading your new book?

179
00:23:37,776 --> 00:23:39,506
There is no new book, can't you tell?

180
00:23:40,246 --> 00:23:42,373
Shit Alex, are you as out of it
as your father?

181
00:23:47,053 --> 00:23:48,145
You don't know my father

182
00:23:50,056 --> 00:23:52,525
I have spent every single day

183
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:56,052
in the same room with that man
since he showed up here a month ago

184
00:23:58,232 --> 00:23:59,860
Alex, it's impossible

185
00:24:00,836 --> 00:24:02,269
He's taken over my work room

186
00:24:03,572 --> 00:24:05,267
I just don't have the space to think

187
00:24:05,307 --> 00:24:07,276
Not enough space?

188
00:24:08,511 --> 00:24:11,446
In China, this house is big enough
for four families

189
00:24:11,481 --> 00:24:14,815
Sure, but they'd speak the same language
so they could talk to each other

190
00:24:14,852 --> 00:24:17,412
Alex, he hasn't learned one word of English

191
00:24:17,521 --> 00:24:18,886
And what about you?

192
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:22,849
What have you done but make fun of him
treating him with disrespect?

193
00:24:22,894 --> 00:24:24,122
Alex, I tried

194
00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:26,488
I'm his only son. 
What do you want me to do?

195
00:24:27,065 --> 00:24:30,900
You could at least consider moving
into a bigger place. We can afford it

196
00:24:30,937 --> 00:24:31,528
No

197
00:24:32,138 --> 00:24:34,299
I don't see why we have to pay
for his insurance

198
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:36,275
let him eat us out of house and home

199
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:38,437
when we can't accept a little loan
from my mother

200
00:24:38,478 --> 00:24:42,210
It's not a little loan, it's a bribe
a big bribe and you know it

201
00:24:52,628 --> 00:24:54,858
You look a little freaked out here

202
00:25:01,538 --> 00:25:03,905
Come on, let's go to bed

203
00:25:16,956 --> 00:25:18,082
Good night, Alex

204
00:25:55,633 --> 00:25:57,692
Honestly Linda, I don't know why we're here

205
00:25:58,236 --> 00:26:00,228
Come on, let's explore

206
00:26:09,049 --> 00:26:10,016
Father and son

207
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:10,982
Father

208
00:26:58,772 --> 00:27:00,103
Sweep

209
00:27:03,077 --> 00:27:04,009
Step back

210
00:27:04,045 --> 00:27:06,070
Collect

211
00:27:06,114 --> 00:27:07,604
Hook

212
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:08,512
Step out

213
00:27:13,422 --> 00:27:14,514
Single whip

214
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:18,552
Play guitar

215
00:27:20,463 --> 00:27:21,327
Lean

216
00:27:24,402 --> 00:27:25,767
White crane spreads its wing

217
00:27:27,638 --> 00:27:28,662
Left hand ward off

218
00:27:28,706 --> 00:27:30,003
Right hand attack

219
00:27:33,011 --> 00:27:34,672
Excuse me, are you the instructor here?

220
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:38,011
I teach the cooking class

221
00:27:38,051 --> 00:27:39,279
My name is Chen and you?

222
00:27:40,086 --> 00:27:41,053
What's your name?

223
00:27:41,087 --> 00:27:41,610
Chu

224
00:27:42,155 --> 00:27:42,712
Master Chu

225
00:27:42,755 --> 00:27:45,054
Please, we're all friends here

226
00:27:45,092 --> 00:27:46,320
Don't call me master

227
00:27:46,693 --> 00:27:50,720
Mr. Chu, I don't know
what our headmaster's thinking

228
00:27:51,098 --> 00:27:55,058
my class is making dumplings, half-done

229
00:27:55,103 --> 00:27:57,264
Some workmen just came in
to do some repairs

230
00:27:57,305 --> 00:27:59,069
we have to leave

231
00:27:59,108 --> 00:28:01,076
I see you have plenty of space here

232
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:02,771
could we move in

233
00:28:02,812 --> 00:28:03,676
just this once?

234
00:28:04,213 --> 00:28:06,045
Dumplings can be moved in

235
00:28:06,083 --> 00:28:08,074
but they can't be moved out

236
00:28:08,385 --> 00:28:10,216
We've also got scallion pancakes
and spring rolls!

237
00:28:13,124 --> 00:28:14,853
Come on, let's help!

238
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,424
Thank you

239
00:28:16,761 --> 00:28:19,389
Sink your chest

240
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:20,659
Stretch your back

241
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:23,099
lmagine a string pulling up your head

242
00:28:23,135 --> 00:28:25,603
Sink lower your body

243
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,629
Master Chu

244
00:28:29,109 --> 00:28:30,633
don't torture the child!

245
00:28:30,677 --> 00:28:32,110
Look at all his weight

246
00:28:32,145 --> 00:28:33,305
How can he 'sink his chest'?

247
00:28:33,747 --> 00:28:35,374
Let him help me knead the dough

248
00:28:37,151 --> 00:28:38,846
Oh, it's so difficult

249
00:28:38,886 --> 00:28:41,856
Mrs. Chen, next week
I'll help you make dumplings

250
00:28:42,224 --> 00:28:43,156
Can I enroll?

251
00:28:43,592 --> 00:28:45,116
Next week, no dumplings

252
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,354
but General Tso's Special Chicken

253
00:30:00,246 --> 00:30:02,476
Master Chu, would you please demonstrate

254
00:30:02,515 --> 00:30:03,880
how to emit force with Pushing Hands?

255
00:30:04,217 --> 00:30:06,186
Okay, let's try

256
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:23,270
My God, would that hurt?

257
00:30:42,694 --> 00:30:45,527
Hey, Mr. Chu, try me

258
00:30:45,564 --> 00:30:46,826
You're too heavy

259
00:30:46,865 --> 00:30:50,233
So your kung-fu can only go so far!

260
00:30:50,637 --> 00:30:51,228
Okay

261
00:30:51,938 --> 00:30:56,376
Mr. Chu, can you take the fighting away?

262
00:30:56,844 --> 00:30:57,811
Don't you see these burners

263
00:30:57,845 --> 00:30:59,403
and the boiling water!

264
00:30:59,446 --> 00:31:00,936
It's alright if Heavyweight gets burned
but the dumplings!

265
00:31:00,981 --> 00:31:02,609
If you smash them
what're we going to eat?

266
00:31:02,984 --> 00:31:03,882
We'll eat roast piglet!

267
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,651
Oh, okay!

268
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:17,027
Far enough? I'm ready Master!

269
00:31:37,891 --> 00:31:39,916
What! Haven't you any eyes to see!

270
00:31:41,628 --> 00:31:43,290
Sorry...!

271
00:31:43,331 --> 00:31:44,355
I don't mean you!

272
00:31:44,598 --> 00:31:46,088
It's your Master who wasn't looking

273
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,731
of all the directions!

274
00:31:47,768 --> 00:31:49,793
Why did you throw Heavyweight
right smack on the dumplings!

275
00:31:49,837 --> 00:31:51,305
Excellent aim!

276
00:31:51,406 --> 00:31:53,397
Okay! No dumplings today!

277
00:31:53,442 --> 00:31:55,376
Instead, we'll have sandy crab
scalded noodle lump soup!

278
00:31:55,644 --> 00:31:57,442
I'm sorry

279
00:31:58,348 --> 00:31:59,337
It wasn't on purpose!

280
00:32:00,583 --> 00:32:01,880
It was on purpose

281
00:32:02,018 --> 00:32:04,009
Are you okay? It was on purpose!

282
00:32:04,421 --> 00:32:05,115
You got mad

283
00:32:05,422 --> 00:32:07,617
In front of all these people sooner or later

284
00:32:07,658 --> 00:32:11,059
I knew you'd show off!

285
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:13,457
Sorry...!

286
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,333
Okay! Don't stand there with a red face!

287
00:32:16,368 --> 00:32:17,995
Let's clean up!

288
00:32:18,336 --> 00:32:20,635
Everyone help!

289
00:32:20,673 --> 00:32:22,664
No more Tai Chi Chuan!
We'll make dumplings!

290
00:32:23,109 --> 00:32:24,872
Come... Did you hear that?

291
00:32:25,411 --> 00:32:26,970
Master says no more Tai Chi!

292
00:32:27,013 --> 00:32:29,504
Let's move

293
00:32:36,557 --> 00:32:38,889
Oh my, what's this shape?

294
00:32:39,427 --> 00:32:40,554
Hold on. Let me see your hands. Filthy!

295
00:32:40,596 --> 00:32:42,496
Men, all of you wash your hands

296
00:32:42,998 --> 00:32:44,761
Use soap! No dirty hands on my dumplings

297
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,427
Is that clear? Quick...

298
00:32:47,804 --> 00:32:49,795
Mr. Chu, sit!

299
00:32:49,839 --> 00:32:51,363
Let the young people stand

300
00:32:51,408 --> 00:32:52,375
Come and sit

301
00:32:55,079 --> 00:32:56,341
Not bad

302
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:58,371
Thin skin, plump stuffing, nice twist

303
00:32:58,883 --> 00:32:59,645
It's nothing

304
00:32:59,884 --> 00:33:02,353
Northerners like making things from dough

305
00:33:02,387 --> 00:33:04,719
Are you from Beijing? Yes.

306
00:33:05,023 --> 00:33:06,422
How long have you been here?

307
00:33:06,458 --> 00:33:07,390
Just over a month

308
00:33:08,561 --> 00:33:09,653
Are you used to it here?

309
00:33:10,062 --> 00:33:11,689
If I was would I be here messing around?

310
00:33:12,732 --> 00:33:14,597
Watch what you're saying, I'm here too

311
00:33:15,936 --> 00:33:16,960
I don't mean that

312
00:33:17,037 --> 00:33:19,471
America is a world for young people

313
00:33:20,107 --> 00:33:21,438
Are you also from Beijing?

314
00:33:21,475 --> 00:33:22,602
Do I seem like I am?

315
00:33:23,545 --> 00:33:25,604
By your accent, yes;
the way you look, no

316
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,539
That's right

317
00:33:27,215 --> 00:33:30,014
In 1949, I went with my husband to Taiwan
to escape the communists

318
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:33,012
And Mr. Chen is... He's dead

319
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:35,422
His name wasn't Chen

320
00:33:36,426 --> 00:33:38,917
Not long after we arrived in Taiwan
he got liver cancer and passed away

321
00:33:39,529 --> 00:33:40,962
I'm called Mrs. Chen

322
00:33:40,997 --> 00:33:42,555
because of my second husband

323
00:33:43,701 --> 00:33:44,565
Oh

324
00:33:45,536 --> 00:33:46,434
and Mr. Chen?

325
00:33:46,471 --> 00:33:48,564
He's dead too, just last year

326
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:52,542
Life and death, it's fate

327
00:33:52,578 --> 00:33:55,046
Riches and rags are given by the gods
You just accept it. Everything is destiny

328
00:33:55,581 --> 00:33:56,570
Sure...

329
00:33:57,750 --> 00:34:00,685
Earlier this year, I left Taiwan
and came to live with my daughter

330
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:04,452
Every Saturday, I bring my granddaughter
here to study Chinese

331
00:34:05,125 --> 00:34:06,990
Are you used to it here?

332
00:34:07,027 --> 00:34:08,085
How did you put it just now?

333
00:34:08,829 --> 00:34:10,923
If I wasn't so bored at home

334
00:34:10,966 --> 00:34:13,491
how could your Heavyweight
have smashed my dumplings?

335
00:34:13,568 --> 00:34:15,229
A computer couldn't have aimed
more accurately

336
00:34:15,904 --> 00:34:17,804
Destiny, it's all destiny

337
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:18,670
That's right!

338
00:34:27,518 --> 00:34:28,280
What kung-fu!

339
00:34:29,152 --> 00:34:29,914
What's the matter?

340
00:34:31,555 --> 00:34:33,786
Since last year sometimes
my right arm just gives out

341
00:34:34,592 --> 00:34:37,083
when I pick up something a little heavy

342
00:34:37,128 --> 00:34:38,095
it's helpless

343
00:34:38,496 --> 00:34:40,260
Have you seen a doctor? Yes

344
00:34:40,866 --> 00:34:42,925
Chinese doctors, western doctors

345
00:34:43,569 --> 00:34:46,539
accupressure, acupuncture
herbal remedies, shots, medicine

346
00:34:47,207 --> 00:34:49,698
I've tried everything
but getting a spell cast on me

347
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:51,709
I'm just old

348
00:34:52,312 --> 00:34:54,679
Mrs. Chen, I don't want to sound
like a self-promoter

349
00:34:54,715 --> 00:34:58,617
but practising Tai Chi will heal your arm

350
00:34:58,786 --> 00:35:00,152
Okay, spare me!

351
00:35:00,222 --> 00:35:01,849
Haven't I suffered enough in this life?

352
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:04,217
Practise? I won't be that stupid

353
00:35:04,259 --> 00:35:08,128
No, when you practise Tai Chi
your circulation and energy will flow

354
00:35:08,164 --> 00:35:10,530
I've let go, I'm not holding on

355
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:16,031
Energy must be released to me

356
00:35:16,774 --> 00:35:19,607
When its released there's no tension
and one feels at ease

357
00:36:55,019 --> 00:36:55,747
What's up?

358
00:36:55,787 --> 00:36:57,152
The review, I can't find it

359
00:37:11,705 --> 00:37:16,734
When you arrive at old age
everything is quiet

360
00:37:17,712 --> 00:37:21,240
There the gentle wind passes through
the pine forest

361
00:37:21,283 --> 00:37:23,717
15 minutes to practice, okay?

362
00:37:23,752 --> 00:37:28,781
When the moon is rising
and shining on the mountain

363
00:37:29,492 --> 00:37:35,022
I only want to go to the familiar forest
I reply with a simple fisherman's song

364
00:37:37,367 --> 00:37:38,095
Alex

365
00:37:39,136 --> 00:37:40,000
Yes?

366
00:37:40,037 --> 00:37:42,302
Does New York have a place
to mat Chinese calligraphy?

367
00:37:42,941 --> 00:37:43,737
Who's the present for?

368
00:37:44,843 --> 00:37:47,744
You know, last week
I smashed Mrs. Chen's dumplings

369
00:37:47,779 --> 00:37:50,749
I was so embarrassed
I want to give her this

370
00:37:50,816 --> 00:37:52,181
I'm just afraid she'll laugh
at my calligraphy

371
00:37:52,318 --> 00:37:53,751
Come on, Dad

372
00:37:53,786 --> 00:37:56,153
we know you're good

373
00:37:58,525 --> 00:37:59,753
What's the matter?

374
00:38:00,093 --> 00:38:01,287
They've ignored the book

375
00:38:01,328 --> 00:38:03,695
Just pretended it doesn't exist

376
00:38:03,731 --> 00:38:04,925
It'll be in next week

377
00:38:05,133 --> 00:38:06,191
What's a matter with her?

378
00:38:07,235 --> 00:38:08,293
There's no review of her book

379
00:38:08,736 --> 00:38:12,764
Years from now
we'll all be lying peacefully underground

380
00:38:12,808 --> 00:38:14,435
What's the big deal?

381
00:38:16,813 --> 00:38:19,247
Dad, when're we going? Coming

382
00:38:22,185 --> 00:38:23,152
What is it?

383
00:38:23,186 --> 00:38:25,849
A stomach cramp or something
Nothing important

384
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:27,448
Do you want to lie down on the couch?

385
00:38:36,168 --> 00:38:36,930
What's wrong with her?

386
00:38:36,968 --> 00:38:38,197
A stomach cramp

387
00:38:38,504 --> 00:38:40,904
Let me take a look. Make her lie down

388
00:38:42,341 --> 00:38:44,206
Dad says he wants to look at it

389
00:38:44,978 --> 00:38:46,912
He knows this kind of thing
He does?

390
00:38:47,314 --> 00:38:48,281
He's an expert

391
00:38:56,791 --> 00:38:59,283
She's too tense
something's wrong with her stomach

392
00:38:59,895 --> 00:39:02,261
You're too tight
Thanks for letting me know

393
00:39:02,898 --> 00:39:04,798
Tell her to relax

394
00:39:06,136 --> 00:39:07,364
Just relax

395
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:32,363
What happened? Mom!

396
00:39:32,398 --> 00:39:34,959
Oh my god! What have you done to me?!
Get away from me! Relax!

397
00:39:35,002 --> 00:39:36,060
What did you do to her?

398
00:39:36,103 --> 00:39:38,003
Her stomach's bleeding!
Quick get her to the hospital!

399
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,866
I want to go too.
Jeremy, be good

400
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:05,563
You broke Mama

401
00:40:14,146 --> 00:40:16,240
Jeremy wants a goldfish, right?

402
00:40:16,283 --> 00:40:17,944
Here's a big tail

403
00:40:23,424 --> 00:40:26,120
Big eyes and thick lips

404
00:40:36,638 --> 00:40:38,300
And wings

405
00:40:55,927 --> 00:40:57,485
What's Martha's condition?

406
00:40:57,529 --> 00:40:58,963
Her stomach was bleeding
She has to stay in the hospital

407
00:40:59,298 --> 00:41:00,424
How's Mommy?

408
00:41:01,033 --> 00:41:01,556
Oh

409
00:41:03,369 --> 00:41:05,531
Mommy's all right
She just needs a little rest, okay?

410
00:41:11,345 --> 00:41:12,938
I didn't do anything to her

411
00:41:12,981 --> 00:41:15,142
Her tension caused her stomach to bleed

412
00:41:16,951 --> 00:41:17,975
I know that

413
00:41:34,372 --> 00:41:36,966
Can I go to the hospital with you?

414
00:41:50,556 --> 00:41:51,181
Dad

415
00:41:52,658 --> 00:41:54,182
Is this the calligraphy you want matted?

416
00:41:55,529 --> 00:41:57,087
Go take care of Martha

417
00:41:57,131 --> 00:41:58,359
Don't bother about me

418
00:42:17,154 --> 00:42:19,816
Can I have some macaroni and cheese, please?

419
00:42:22,292 --> 00:42:24,488
Wait until Sunday
when your mother comes home, all right?

420
00:42:54,162 --> 00:42:56,153
Master Chu
Hello everybody!

421
00:42:56,465 --> 00:42:58,832
Master Chu, they tell me
your kung-fu is great

422
00:42:58,868 --> 00:43:01,462
Last week, you barely touched Mr. Sung
and you sent him flying

423
00:43:01,504 --> 00:43:03,472
And you threw Heavyweight
right on the dumplings

424
00:43:05,075 --> 00:43:07,566
Nah, where's Mrs. Chen then?

425
00:43:07,778 --> 00:43:10,713
I don't know. She's not coming anymore
I'm the new teacher

426
00:43:11,248 --> 00:43:12,181
Mrs. Chen not teaching? 
Yes

427
00:43:12,217 --> 00:43:13,844
Why?
I don't know

428
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:15,513
You can ask them

429
00:43:16,421 --> 00:43:19,050
Her family's going to that other school
north of here

430
00:43:19,091 --> 00:43:22,527
If you want to contact her, you can ask
the principal about her telephone number

431
00:43:23,896 --> 00:43:26,092
Okay, I'll go for my class

432
00:43:27,734 --> 00:43:30,635
Is this General Tso's Special Chicken?

433
00:43:31,104 --> 00:43:34,199
No, we aren't making chicken
This is to make 'eoly ice'

434
00:43:34,809 --> 00:43:36,470
'Eoly ice'? Yes

435
00:43:36,511 --> 00:43:39,275
Oily rice. Oh yes, OlLY RlCE!

436
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:47,781
Hey, do you want us to bring the oily
rice over so you can throw Heavyweight in?

437
00:44:15,622 --> 00:44:17,852
Alex, will you make a call for me?

438
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:22,926
Mrs. Chen's family doesn't come here anymore

439
00:44:23,464 --> 00:44:24,863
I still have to

440
00:44:24,899 --> 00:44:27,299
give her the calligraphy

441
00:44:34,476 --> 00:44:35,636
No one's home. It's their machine

442
00:44:38,748 --> 00:44:40,682
Yici Chen. This is Alex Chu

443
00:44:40,717 --> 00:44:42,776
My Dad has a present to give your mother

444
00:44:42,819 --> 00:44:44,151
Give us a call

445
00:44:44,188 --> 00:44:46,748
at 287-0425. Thanks

446
00:44:48,726 --> 00:44:50,627
How can you talk like that?

447
00:44:50,662 --> 00:44:51,856
Like what?

448
00:44:51,930 --> 00:44:54,592
I'm not going to the hospital
with you to see Martha

449
00:44:54,633 --> 00:44:56,225
Take me home to wait for the call

450
00:44:56,335 --> 00:44:58,236
Relax Dad, they're not going anywhere

451
00:44:58,271 --> 00:44:59,863
I can't communicate with Martha

452
00:44:59,906 --> 00:45:03,672
You'll be there for hours
and all I can do is stare into space

453
00:45:04,210 --> 00:45:04,905
Okay

454
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:09,213
Hey mister, don't kid me

455
00:45:09,617 --> 00:45:10,982
I never kid anybody

456
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:37,313
Hello... It's me

457
00:46:37,951 --> 00:46:40,419
Mrs. Chen?

458
00:46:42,055 --> 00:46:45,389
Why weren't you at school?

459
00:46:47,328 --> 00:46:48,352
Yes...

460
00:46:48,930 --> 00:46:51,627
Don't listen to my kid. What nonsense!

461
00:46:52,034 --> 00:46:53,661
It's not a present

462
00:46:54,436 --> 00:46:57,065
I'm still embarrassed

463
00:46:57,574 --> 00:46:59,439
about what I did to your class last week

464
00:47:04,348 --> 00:47:06,111
Okay. How about this?

465
00:47:07,385 --> 00:47:10,582
Tomorrow at 11:00 AM, my son's going to get
his wife at the hospital

466
00:47:10,621 --> 00:47:14,353
We'll come by at 10:30 AM

467
00:47:14,693 --> 00:47:16,558
Okay...

468
00:47:19,365 --> 00:47:21,833
It's nothing

469
00:47:21,868 --> 00:47:23,028
She has a small stomach problem

470
00:47:27,074 --> 00:47:29,474
Right, then

471
00:47:30,711 --> 00:47:32,441
see you tomorrow

472
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:03,438
Hello, Uncle Chu!

473
00:48:03,482 --> 00:48:05,177
Not at all. Welcome!

474
00:48:05,484 --> 00:48:06,746
Mother, they've come!

475
00:48:07,086 --> 00:48:07,882
How are you, Yici?

476
00:48:07,921 --> 00:48:10,617
Hi! Hi, Jeremy Hi, auntie

477
00:48:10,790 --> 00:48:12,621
Why are you all guarding the door?

478
00:48:12,659 --> 00:48:13,887
Come in, sit down!

479
00:48:13,927 --> 00:48:16,522
Sorry, we've got to get to the hospital
to pick up my wife

480
00:48:16,564 --> 00:48:17,622
Oh, you can't be late then

481
00:48:17,665 --> 00:48:18,893
Is your wife, all right?

482
00:48:20,167 --> 00:48:21,499
What am I talking about!

483
00:48:21,603 --> 00:48:23,036
She's getting out of the hospital

484
00:48:24,739 --> 00:48:26,036
Mr. Chu, how are you?

485
00:48:26,875 --> 00:48:30,437
Good, Mrs. Chen, at your new school

486
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,573
is there a cooking class?

487
00:48:32,782 --> 00:48:34,977
Not until I showed up

488
00:48:35,586 --> 00:48:36,678
There's a kung-fu class too

489
00:48:37,154 --> 00:48:38,451
But it's only Karate

490
00:48:38,889 --> 00:48:41,016
They don't have grace

491
00:48:41,058 --> 00:48:42,788
Better than Tai Chi Chuan

492
00:48:42,961 --> 00:48:45,930
they sound much tougher

493
00:48:46,564 --> 00:48:47,656
but they can't throw anywhere near
as far as you!

494
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:50,762
Dad, we'd better get going

495
00:48:51,270 --> 00:48:52,601
I planned for you to stay for lunch

496
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:53,662
but you've got to get to the hospital

497
00:48:53,973 --> 00:48:55,235
I won't keep you

498
00:48:55,274 --> 00:48:56,640
for dinner

499
00:48:56,877 --> 00:48:59,471
Next time.
Thanks and bye

500
00:49:01,882 --> 00:49:05,580
Uh, you stopped by today to?

501
00:49:06,087 --> 00:49:09,523
Ah! I forgot

502
00:49:10,626 --> 00:49:11,752
You shouldn't have. Thank you

503
00:49:12,094 --> 00:49:13,186
I'm going to hang it up right away

504
00:49:13,228 --> 00:49:15,162
It's nothing

505
00:49:15,697 --> 00:49:16,664
Drive carefully!

506
00:49:17,534 --> 00:49:18,626
Bye

507
00:49:19,202 --> 00:49:19,827
Good bye!

508
00:49:20,003 --> 00:49:20,662
Bye!

509
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:28,301
What's the rush!
We didn't even get the scroll open!

510
00:49:43,663 --> 00:49:44,527
Thanks!

511
00:50:24,343 --> 00:50:25,241
Toothache?

512
00:50:35,723 --> 00:50:38,692
There isn't much you can do,
but you sure have a lot of problems

513
00:50:46,601 --> 00:50:47,932
Mr. Philips called

514
00:50:47,969 --> 00:50:51,406
Jeremy received the lowest
reading score in the gifted class again

515
00:50:51,707 --> 00:50:53,766
That school is too distracting for him

516
00:50:53,809 --> 00:50:55,971
No Alex, we're too distracting for him

517
00:50:56,013 --> 00:50:57,947
He's only responding
to the situation at home

518
00:50:57,981 --> 00:50:58,879
Then change it!

519
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:09,224
What's your problem?

520
00:51:09,662 --> 00:51:10,321
What's your problem?

521
00:51:10,362 --> 00:51:11,158
I ain't got any problem

522
00:51:11,196 --> 00:51:12,686
Get back in the car, Alex!

523
00:51:13,165 --> 00:51:13,790
Shut up!

524
00:52:15,403 --> 00:52:16,802
Great

525
00:52:32,522 --> 00:52:33,113
Martha

526
00:52:33,823 --> 00:52:36,452
What do you want?
I'm going for a walk

527
00:52:36,494 --> 00:52:39,122
A walk? I don't know

528
00:52:39,163 --> 00:52:41,029
I don't want to see you getting lost

529
00:52:41,166 --> 00:52:41,928
Smoking

530
00:52:41,967 --> 00:52:43,366
You know, in a way
I'm kind of baby sitting you

531
00:52:43,401 --> 00:52:48,169
I'll just hang around here, I won't go far.
Do you understand what I'm saying to you?

532
00:52:48,207 --> 00:52:50,004
All right. Go ahead

533
00:52:51,811 --> 00:52:52,743
What do I care?

534
00:53:05,493 --> 00:53:08,860
Oh Jeremy, where'd you get those?

535
00:53:09,030 --> 00:53:10,498
Teddy gave them to me

536
00:53:10,866 --> 00:53:12,390
Well go put them away

537
00:53:14,170 --> 00:53:16,196
Go on. Go get yourself cleaned up

538
00:53:18,842 --> 00:53:19,365
Dad?

539
00:53:25,883 --> 00:53:27,817
What're you looking for?
Dad

540
00:53:27,852 --> 00:53:28,375
Where is he?

541
00:53:28,553 --> 00:53:29,212
Oh

542
00:53:29,887 --> 00:53:31,150
Where is he?

543
00:54:16,007 --> 00:54:17,167
Is he back? No

544
00:55:12,972 --> 00:55:14,405
Did you check with the police?

545
00:55:39,102 --> 00:55:42,538
Alex, I'm sorry
I should've been more careful

546
00:55:42,572 --> 00:55:45,041
But I'm... uh... with the book

547
00:55:46,010 --> 00:55:50,208
In some ways, your father is more and
more like a child cooped up here with me

548
00:55:50,247 --> 00:55:52,011
And I can't talk to him

549
00:55:52,751 --> 00:55:54,116
I was trying to write

550
00:55:55,687 --> 00:55:58,122
I had a feeling that
he was gonna get himself lost

551
00:55:59,325 --> 00:56:01,555
just like a kid
trying to get some attention

552
00:56:04,097 --> 00:56:07,033
I grew up believing
you should care for your parents

553
00:56:07,067 --> 00:56:08,432
the way they care for you

554
00:56:10,237 --> 00:56:11,967
My father is a part of me

555
00:56:13,008 --> 00:56:14,600
Why can't you accept that?

556
00:56:22,218 --> 00:56:25,016
I know. I tried

557
00:56:26,623 --> 00:56:28,056
Just leave me alone

558
00:57:55,124 --> 00:57:57,685
Oh my god. You've found him
Thanks God he's safe

559
00:57:57,861 --> 00:57:59,260
We're looking for a Mr. Alex Chu

560
00:57:59,762 --> 00:58:03,198
Alex is still out
looking for his father. I'm his wife

561
00:58:03,399 --> 00:58:05,868
Okay. Mr. Chu, you take care of yourself, now.
All right?

562
00:58:06,137 --> 00:58:07,399
Thank you very much officers

563
00:58:12,277 --> 00:58:15,246
Alex is still out looking for you
Are you hungry?

564
00:58:16,915 --> 00:58:17,745
Thirsty?

565
00:58:38,373 --> 00:58:39,864
You really should eat something

566
00:58:45,814 --> 00:58:50,252
I'm sorry too. Alex is furious

567
01:00:03,503 --> 01:00:06,996
Jesus! How did you get so drunk?

568
01:00:07,441 --> 01:00:09,773
Where did you go?

569
01:00:09,810 --> 01:00:11,403
I was just walking around

570
01:00:11,446 --> 01:00:14,415
and I lost sight of the church steeple
my landmark

571
01:00:15,517 --> 01:00:17,542
The police brought him back a couple of hours ago

572
01:00:19,355 --> 01:00:20,845
You're back, that's good

573
01:01:04,940 --> 01:01:08,308
What are you doing?...
What're you doing, Alex?

574
01:01:08,411 --> 01:01:09,309
Nothing

575
01:01:09,346 --> 01:01:11,780
I know this wall, it isn't thick

576
01:01:12,582 --> 01:01:14,710
What are you doing?

577
01:01:17,088 --> 01:01:17,918
Mommy

578
01:01:19,323 --> 01:01:21,485
Calm down...

579
01:01:27,866 --> 01:01:30,461
Jeremy, Daddy's not feeling well

580
01:01:30,503 --> 01:01:31,401
He'll be all right

581
01:01:32,839 --> 01:01:33,863
Let me talk to him

582
01:01:34,540 --> 01:01:38,739
Jeremy. Dad banged his head by accident

583
01:01:38,812 --> 01:01:39,938
Do you need a band aid?

584
01:01:40,414 --> 01:01:40,812
Okay

585
01:01:48,957 --> 01:01:52,894
Jeremy... is the good one

586
01:01:56,466 --> 01:01:59,594
who knows better than Mommy and Grandpa
how to care for Daddy

587
01:02:23,430 --> 01:02:26,423
I haven't seen you that drunk
since the night we got married

588
01:02:27,101 --> 01:02:28,864
That drunk?
Yeah

589
01:02:29,970 --> 01:02:32,769
Well, my head's clear now

590
01:02:32,808 --> 01:02:33,968
What're you mumbling about?

591
01:02:35,710 --> 01:02:37,473
I've made up my mind already

592
01:02:38,113 --> 01:02:39,046
About what?

593
01:02:40,149 --> 01:02:41,776
The old man has to go

594
01:02:42,652 --> 01:02:45,052
I'll send him to an old people's apartment

595
01:02:47,558 --> 01:02:48,525
Are you sure?

596
01:02:49,493 --> 01:02:51,518
I really don't have too much choice, do I?

597
01:02:55,133 --> 01:02:56,566
I'll go tell him right now

598
01:03:32,942 --> 01:03:33,840
Come in

599
01:03:36,714 --> 01:03:39,581
Dad, why didn't you get up
and exercise today?

600
01:03:43,622 --> 01:03:44,816
Aren't you feeling well?

601
01:03:47,526 --> 01:03:48,619
What's wrong?

602
01:03:48,661 --> 01:03:53,564
I probably caught cold
from being outside too long last night

603
01:03:57,905 --> 01:03:58,929
I'm going to call a doctor

604
01:03:59,306 --> 01:04:02,036
You've got important business at work

605
01:04:02,075 --> 01:04:04,306
Don't waste your time on me

606
01:04:04,812 --> 01:04:06,712
Come on Dad, cut it out!
You're never sick

607
01:04:07,215 --> 01:04:09,707
if you don't feel well
it must be serious

608
01:04:10,286 --> 01:04:11,810
I'll find a doctor for you

609
01:04:13,088 --> 01:04:17,048
Why get sick now?
The vital organs aren't in harmony

610
01:04:17,093 --> 01:04:19,721
The circulation's blocked
That's why I'm sick

611
01:04:43,256 --> 01:04:45,782
Dad, Ma's been gone for so many years

612
01:04:45,826 --> 01:04:47,691
and you've never wanted to look at her picture

613
01:04:48,596 --> 01:04:50,086
I couldn't face her

614
01:04:51,699 --> 01:04:52,894
Do you remember this scar!?

615
01:04:55,670 --> 01:04:57,604
The day when the red guards came to our house

616
01:04:58,340 --> 01:05:00,571
they knew they couldn't hurt me

617
01:05:01,110 --> 01:05:03,237
so they took it out on you and your mother

618
01:05:03,813 --> 01:05:05,337
I only had this one body!

619
01:05:06,149 --> 01:05:08,640
In protecting you
I couldn't protect your mother

620
01:05:09,386 --> 01:05:12,982
When they finally stopped their beating,
she was too gravely injured to survive

621
01:05:13,725 --> 01:05:16,819
In this one life
I can never face your mother again

622
01:05:16,861 --> 01:05:18,089
but I can face you!

623
01:05:18,830 --> 01:05:21,800
It's been so many years

624
01:05:21,834 --> 01:05:23,324
why talk about it now?

625
01:05:25,070 --> 01:05:26,594
I feel stifled

626
01:05:27,674 --> 01:05:28,868
Let me tell you something

627
01:05:28,908 --> 01:05:31,638
compared to loneliness, persecution is easy

628
01:05:32,746 --> 01:05:34,647
Look at how much hardship

629
01:05:35,149 --> 01:05:39,643
and injustice I've endured

630
01:05:39,687 --> 01:05:41,986
in the last 40 years

631
01:05:42,658 --> 01:05:45,718
Their tortures only inspired me
to perfect my kung-fu

632
01:05:47,129 --> 01:05:49,155
To study the Soft internal style of strength

633
01:05:49,198 --> 01:05:52,133
we pursue more refined states of being

634
01:05:52,368 --> 01:05:55,202
with the loss of tension
we attain concentration

635
01:05:55,239 --> 01:05:59,141
And from that one
we achieve carefree nothingness

636
01:05:59,176 --> 01:06:01,838
but this is nearly impossible to attain

637
01:06:03,415 --> 01:06:06,407
Yes, it's easy to have physical strength
but inner strength is harder to practise

638
01:06:06,451 --> 01:06:09,785
Go on, don't bullshit me!

639
01:06:12,725 --> 01:06:14,659
Okay, I'll go call a doctor

640
01:06:15,961 --> 01:06:20,126
Do me a favor
and call the Chinese school principal

641
01:06:20,167 --> 01:06:22,101
tell him I can't teach
the class on Saturday

642
01:06:23,271 --> 01:06:24,761
Okay. You'll go when you're better

643
01:06:24,806 --> 01:06:26,330
I'm not going anymore

644
01:06:26,941 --> 01:06:27,737
Why?

645
01:06:28,743 --> 01:06:31,770
The students always want me to show off
I hate that

646
01:06:32,481 --> 01:06:34,142
Then what will you do on the weekends?

647
01:06:34,850 --> 01:06:38,218
Why don't we change
to that school north of here

648
01:06:38,388 --> 01:06:39,855
You mean with Mrs. Chen?

649
01:06:40,090 --> 01:06:43,821
No! They say it'll be good
for Jeremy's studies

650
01:06:44,295 --> 01:06:47,025
I heard they're much stricter

651
01:06:48,699 --> 01:06:49,859
How about it?

652
01:06:57,876 --> 01:06:59,105
So did you tell him?

653
01:06:59,145 --> 01:07:01,477
He's sick. Caught a cold from last night

654
01:07:01,848 --> 01:07:02,405
I couldn't tell him

655
01:07:02,448 --> 01:07:03,437
I hope it's not serious

656
01:07:04,283 --> 01:07:05,215
No, I don't think so

657
01:07:05,886 --> 01:07:07,786
But I'd better take him to the doctor's

658
01:07:10,390 --> 01:07:11,322
I've got a great idea

659
01:07:11,358 --> 01:07:13,725
about what to do with him
without hurting anyone's feelings

660
01:07:15,730 --> 01:07:16,719
What's that?

661
01:07:20,269 --> 01:07:21,736
Just be patient

662
01:07:21,771 --> 01:07:25,036
Promise me, you'll be nice to him
for the time being

663
01:07:25,074 --> 01:07:26,838
Okay?
Go on!

664
01:07:37,889 --> 01:07:40,323
What?
Nothing

665
01:07:40,759 --> 01:07:42,556
Then why do you keep looking
at your watch?

666
01:07:43,762 --> 01:07:44,524
Nothing

667
01:07:51,070 --> 01:07:55,030
Hello... yes, I am. Yici

668
01:07:55,876 --> 01:07:57,844
How's the picnic?

669
01:08:00,781 --> 01:08:02,807
Sorry for bothering you again

670
01:08:02,884 --> 01:08:04,044
Yes, it's great weather

671
01:08:04,085 --> 01:08:05,882
and great for a picnic

672
01:08:06,321 --> 01:08:07,811
Unfortunately he doesn't have much energy now

673
01:08:07,856 --> 01:08:10,291
If he got sick again, it'll be trouble

674
01:08:10,927 --> 01:08:12,554
Take a break

675
01:08:13,796 --> 01:08:16,357
Say thank you to Chen Mama for me

676
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:17,833
Okay

677
01:08:17,868 --> 01:08:19,495
Don't hang up. Hold on

678
01:08:20,204 --> 01:08:21,831
Who said I'm sick?

679
01:08:22,540 --> 01:08:24,007
I didn't say sick, I said energy

680
01:08:24,475 --> 01:08:27,569
No energy - means you need to get out!

681
01:08:31,050 --> 01:08:33,575
My father says he's fine

682
01:08:33,619 --> 01:08:35,109
he'd like to get some exercise

683
01:08:35,554 --> 01:08:38,547
Let's use our plan then.
Okay

684
01:08:38,592 --> 01:08:42,323
Okay, that's settled then

685
01:08:42,362 --> 01:08:43,124
Bye

686
01:08:44,131 --> 01:08:45,359
Right

687
01:08:45,399 --> 01:08:47,094
How can it be healthy

688
01:08:47,134 --> 01:08:50,160
to stay home all the time!

689
01:09:07,992 --> 01:09:09,254
Ma, I've already had two

690
01:09:09,293 --> 01:09:10,225
Have more

691
01:09:11,128 --> 01:09:12,994
Here, Yi-yi. Thank you.

692
01:09:13,565 --> 01:09:14,964
Kids should eat more

693
01:09:16,935 --> 01:09:17,594
Jeremy

694
01:09:17,636 --> 01:09:18,603
No, thanks

695
01:09:19,906 --> 01:09:20,634
Have more!

696
01:09:20,907 --> 01:09:22,374
Help yourself, don't worry about him

697
01:09:22,942 --> 01:09:23,966
Have another piece No...

698
01:09:24,010 --> 01:09:25,375
There's lots of meat

699
01:09:25,411 --> 01:09:26,902
no point in saving it

700
01:09:27,614 --> 01:09:29,479
I have to leave some room for tonight

701
01:09:30,284 --> 01:09:31,444
It's the middle of the day

702
01:09:31,485 --> 01:09:33,283
You're a big man!

703
01:09:33,888 --> 01:09:34,320
Come on!

704
01:09:34,355 --> 01:09:35,982
I haven't eaten since yesterday morning

705
01:09:36,024 --> 01:09:37,616
I've been preparing for the dinner
you're cooking tonight

706
01:09:38,026 --> 01:09:38,993
You're a stupid one

707
01:09:40,195 --> 01:09:41,389
Nonsense! Here

708
01:09:42,164 --> 01:09:44,325
He's reaching middle age

709
01:09:44,366 --> 01:09:45,128
he's afraid of fat

710
01:09:45,167 --> 01:09:47,636
cholesterol, and high blood pressure
Give it to me

711
01:09:51,675 --> 01:09:52,573
Ma, again?

712
01:09:52,609 --> 01:09:54,271
Yes, damn it

713
01:09:55,146 --> 01:09:56,135
Can you give me a little massage?

714
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:03,246
Let me take a look

715
01:10:03,455 --> 01:10:06,515
How can I let you do that?

716
01:10:06,658 --> 01:10:07,420
It's okay

717
01:10:14,567 --> 01:10:15,626
Did you find the spot?

718
01:10:16,070 --> 01:10:17,298
This is the trouble

719
01:10:17,338 --> 01:10:19,431
If it's trouble, leave it alone.
No

720
01:10:19,540 --> 01:10:25,036
There's too little qi flow and too much blood

721
01:10:25,080 --> 01:10:27,913
This kind of problem
is called Mid-Spring Paralysis

722
01:10:27,949 --> 01:10:31,317
Now try to move the pinky toe on your left foot

723
01:10:37,094 --> 01:10:38,493
Did you feel that subtle pain?

724
01:10:40,097 --> 01:10:41,029
So, I was right

725
01:10:41,064 --> 01:10:42,929
When this illness gets serious

726
01:10:42,966 --> 01:10:45,936
you'll get a spasm under your knee,
a sore waist,

727
01:10:45,970 --> 01:10:48,268
you back will give out,
your neck will tense up,

728
01:10:48,306 --> 01:10:51,401
you won't be able to lift your arm,

729
01:10:51,443 --> 01:10:55,004
and your muscles will be stretched
between your armpits in one tight knot

730
01:10:55,514 --> 01:10:57,608
Enough! In a minute

731
01:10:57,650 --> 01:11:00,448
you'll be looking right through
at all my internal organs!

732
01:11:00,687 --> 01:11:01,585
Let me see

733
01:11:02,589 --> 01:11:04,056
It's her right shoulder that's stiff

734
01:11:04,090 --> 01:11:05,285
He knows!

735
01:11:05,326 --> 01:11:07,055
He was rubbing your left hand

736
01:11:07,094 --> 01:11:07,685
Shush!

737
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:32,054
It's burning.
Burning?

738
01:11:32,089 --> 01:11:33,523
Your meat, on the barbeque

739
01:11:36,361 --> 01:11:39,023
Why don't you pay attention
to your own business?

740
01:11:40,032 --> 01:11:41,021
Mr. Chu, thank you

741
01:11:42,068 --> 01:11:43,160
I've just begun

742
01:11:43,769 --> 01:11:46,398
You've got a complicated problem

743
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:48,169
It would take over a year of treatment
to get results

744
01:11:48,742 --> 01:11:51,176
What a bother!
Okay, don't break me apart

745
01:11:52,279 --> 01:11:55,681
Jeremy, let's go play frisbee

746
01:11:55,716 --> 01:11:56,683
Oh goody, goody

747
01:11:56,717 --> 01:11:58,116
I want to look now

748
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:00,782
Don't go too far, you hear me?
Okay

749
01:12:11,601 --> 01:12:14,126
Mr. Chu, your kung-fu is so powerful

750
01:12:14,170 --> 01:12:15,570
how do you manage
to have such elegant calligraphy?

751
01:12:15,739 --> 01:12:18,606
I'm ashamed to talk about it

752
01:12:19,210 --> 01:12:21,736
My grandfather
was a Ching Dynasty Scholar

753
01:12:21,780 --> 01:12:24,271
my father was one of the founders

754
01:12:24,316 --> 01:12:27,285
of the Nationalist government

755
01:12:27,552 --> 01:12:30,215
My son is a Ph. D. in computer science

756
01:12:30,256 --> 01:12:32,224
In the middle of this line

757
01:12:32,258 --> 01:12:35,159
there's worthless me

758
01:12:35,194 --> 01:12:37,129
Fate and circumstances

759
01:12:37,164 --> 01:12:40,099
pushed me to spend my life

760
01:12:40,601 --> 01:12:42,193
practising martial arts

761
01:12:42,269 --> 01:12:44,534
You shouldn't say that

762
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:49,404
I had bad health when I was a kid

763
01:12:49,444 --> 01:12:51,470
I'm an only son

764
01:12:51,514 --> 01:12:54,108
My family was worried

765
01:12:54,150 --> 01:12:57,143
They took one of the doctor's advice

766
01:12:57,187 --> 01:13:01,123
and made me practise kung-fu

767
01:13:01,291 --> 01:13:03,886
I couldn't take the hard styles

768
01:13:03,928 --> 01:13:08,262
I could only take the gentle styles
like Tai Chi Chuan

769
01:13:12,371 --> 01:13:15,738
Who would have thought that
a couple of years later

770
01:13:15,774 --> 01:13:18,801
I was completely vigorous and healthy

771
01:13:19,679 --> 01:13:21,374
At 30

772
01:13:21,414 --> 01:13:24,542
I won a national
Tai Chi Pushing Hands Championship

773
01:13:24,584 --> 01:13:27,145
Exercising the body and teaching students

774
01:13:27,688 --> 01:13:30,179
That's a relatively simple,
trouble-free life

775
01:13:31,258 --> 01:13:32,783
What's good?

776
01:13:32,827 --> 01:13:36,888
Since the communist liberation
I've been persecuted in every movement

777
01:13:37,199 --> 01:13:38,689
Let's not talk about it

778
01:13:38,734 --> 01:13:42,170
Teaching students has hurt me so much

779
01:13:42,205 --> 01:13:43,172
Yes

780
01:13:43,573 --> 01:13:46,168
Have you gone back to see your old home
and relatives since Taiwan loosened up?

781
01:13:46,743 --> 01:13:47,903
Last year

782
01:13:49,213 --> 01:13:50,737
I went back but I don't have any
close relatives, just a few nieces

783
01:13:50,781 --> 01:13:52,339
and nephews

784
01:13:53,718 --> 01:13:55,447
Still, a reunion with your family

785
01:13:56,187 --> 01:13:58,985
it must have been a happy time

786
01:13:59,224 --> 01:14:00,192
Not really

787
01:14:03,229 --> 01:14:05,356
When I left, they weren't born

788
01:14:06,532 --> 01:14:08,000
I felt like Santa Claus

789
01:14:08,435 --> 01:14:09,925
giving so many gifts

790
01:14:09,970 --> 01:14:11,232
None of them were born when I left!

791
01:14:12,305 --> 01:14:13,431
Beijing seemed to have

792
01:14:13,807 --> 01:14:15,537
lost its flavor

793
01:14:15,576 --> 01:14:17,703
the old warmth was gone

794
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:21,749
But I was very young when I left 40 years ago

795
01:14:22,851 --> 01:14:24,876
maybe my memories are mistaken

796
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:25,887
Anyway

797
01:14:26,822 --> 01:14:30,224
I don't know what it was

798
01:14:30,293 --> 01:14:31,954
everything seemed unreal. I couldn't
put my old and new impression together

799
01:14:32,362 --> 01:14:34,991
Your impressions are not mistaken

800
01:14:35,532 --> 01:14:36,624
Beijing has changed a lot

801
01:14:37,534 --> 01:14:38,364
Is that so?

802
01:14:39,336 --> 01:14:45,606
When I talk with you, I feel closer
to you than with my neighbors in Beijing

803
01:14:45,644 --> 01:14:46,440
Really?

804
01:14:47,646 --> 01:14:49,672
Relax, don't move

805
01:15:16,412 --> 01:15:17,675
Ma, you're still in one piece

806
01:15:18,048 --> 01:15:18,912
You child!

807
01:15:19,716 --> 01:15:21,707
We're going to take the kids up the hill

808
01:15:22,085 --> 01:15:23,416
Don't go too far.
Okay

809
01:15:24,388 --> 01:15:25,946
Don't leave us here!

810
01:15:25,990 --> 01:15:26,615
I'm going with you

811
01:15:27,291 --> 01:15:28,349
Ma, it's a steep climb

812
01:15:28,392 --> 01:15:29,256
You won't make it

813
01:15:29,293 --> 01:15:31,285
I'll take it slow

814
01:15:31,763 --> 01:15:33,856
Come on! Let's get everything cleaned up

815
01:15:33,899 --> 01:15:34,866
and put in the car

816
01:15:44,077 --> 01:15:46,774
Let the young folks go ahead

817
01:15:47,414 --> 01:15:48,381
You take it slow

818
01:15:48,849 --> 01:15:49,975
No, I'm fine

819
01:15:51,685 --> 01:15:53,916
How come your son-in-law
didn't come today?

820
01:15:56,524 --> 01:15:58,788
Gone... gone... a... way on a bus...

821
01:15:59,362 --> 01:16:00,351
business trip

822
01:16:00,396 --> 01:16:02,125
If he weren't away we wouldn't have you
over for dinner

823
01:16:04,100 --> 01:16:04,657
Don't mention him

824
01:16:04,700 --> 01:16:06,430
He makes me angry

825
01:16:07,070 --> 01:16:07,968
What about your daughter-in-law?

826
01:16:09,373 --> 01:16:11,136
Ah... let's go

827
01:16:20,786 --> 01:16:22,879
Chen Mama, it's too much for you
Let's go down

828
01:16:22,921 --> 01:16:24,149
Nonsense! Let's go!

829
01:17:03,435 --> 01:17:06,598
Don't run so fast, wait for me

830
01:17:07,439 --> 01:17:08,406
Hey!

831
01:17:13,446 --> 01:17:17,178
The young are so energetic

832
01:17:17,551 --> 01:17:20,019
They can't slow down. Let them go ahead

833
01:17:20,086 --> 01:17:22,486
I'll climb slowly with you. Why not
sit down and rest a bit

834
01:17:30,933 --> 01:17:33,163
I'm old, useless

835
01:17:33,202 --> 01:17:34,567
No one wants me

836
01:17:35,471 --> 01:17:38,032
We're out for fun
Why get mad at the kids?

837
01:17:39,576 --> 01:17:42,670
How can you be so developed in kung-fu
and not have any insight?

838
01:17:43,513 --> 01:17:45,106
They set us up

839
01:17:45,516 --> 01:17:46,073
Set us up?

840
01:17:47,451 --> 01:17:48,975
Your precious son came to our house last week

841
01:17:49,019 --> 01:17:51,544
and arranged for my daughter

842
01:17:52,057 --> 01:17:54,753
to call and invite you

843
01:17:55,460 --> 01:17:57,553
They thought I was taking a nap

844
01:17:57,596 --> 01:17:58,962
but I heard everything

845
01:18:00,032 --> 01:18:00,896
Can it be?

846
01:18:00,933 --> 01:18:01,991
How come

847
01:18:02,535 --> 01:18:04,526
at our age

848
01:18:05,839 --> 01:18:07,568
we don't have any self-respect?

849
01:18:07,608 --> 01:18:09,041
Letting two children manipulate us!

850
01:18:10,744 --> 01:18:12,575
What is this?

851
01:18:15,583 --> 01:18:18,177
I'm old and useless

852
01:18:27,831 --> 01:18:32,029
Son, thank you for your good will

853
01:18:32,068 --> 01:18:35,971
trying to fix me up with Mrs. Chen

854
01:18:36,007 --> 01:18:38,202
But we still have our pride
No need to drive me out

855
01:18:38,242 --> 01:18:39,573
I have the sense to leave on my own

856
01:18:40,111 --> 01:18:43,172
You know the saying
'It's easier to struggle together

857
01:18:43,215 --> 01:18:44,580
than to pass happy days together'

858
01:18:44,816 --> 01:18:46,181
I never imagined

859
01:18:46,218 --> 01:18:48,881
this would apply to us

860
01:18:49,556 --> 01:18:52,252
In China

861
01:18:53,192 --> 01:18:56,720
we managed to stay happily together
through so many bitter times

862
01:18:57,164 --> 01:18:59,530
but here in America, with so
many fine material things

863
01:18:59,567 --> 01:19:02,002
it seems there's no place in your home for me

864
01:19:02,604 --> 01:19:05,266
Comparing the two

865
01:19:05,307 --> 01:19:10,245
I can't help but recall the days
when you were a small, lovely boy

866
01:19:10,947 --> 01:19:11,936
Don't look for me

867
01:19:12,615 --> 01:19:15,311
Enjoy your life with your family

868
01:19:15,851 --> 01:19:17,547
I wish you all the best

869
01:19:17,854 --> 01:19:19,845
If you have time

870
01:19:19,890 --> 01:19:22,188
send my regards to Mrs. Chen
and her daughter

871
01:19:23,227 --> 01:19:26,822
The world is so big
I'll find a little room

872
01:19:27,365 --> 01:19:30,631
where I can spend my worthless old age

873
01:19:30,903 --> 01:19:33,235
Life passes before one's eyes like smoke.
Nothing but emptiness

874
01:19:33,272 --> 01:19:36,799
One shouldn't set one's heart on anything

875
01:19:36,842 --> 01:19:38,743
Father

876
01:19:49,590 --> 01:19:52,082
Thank you, come again

877
01:19:53,662 --> 01:19:54,321
Bye-bye

878
01:20:04,974 --> 01:20:06,374
Please, faster

879
01:20:06,410 --> 01:20:08,241
if I can't put out the soup
my other dishes can't go out

880
01:20:08,278 --> 01:20:09,745
I'll wash you a bowl

881
01:20:09,780 --> 01:20:10,769
Sorry

882
01:20:13,618 --> 01:20:14,209
Thanks

883
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:17,244
Old Chu, I beg you please, faster

884
01:20:17,288 --> 01:20:18,653
Coming...

885
01:20:21,927 --> 01:20:23,792
Why do you keep sending out
the take-out orders?

886
01:20:23,829 --> 01:20:25,763
There's guests at the tables
with nothing to eat!

887
01:20:25,798 --> 01:20:26,993
And a line around the block!

888
01:20:27,234 --> 01:20:28,724
We can't put out the food

889
01:20:29,102 --> 01:20:30,091
without dishes!

890
01:20:32,673 --> 01:20:35,142
Yesterday at the employment agency
you said you had experience!

891
01:20:35,176 --> 01:20:36,973
More or less

892
01:20:37,412 --> 01:20:39,710
I'm running a business to make money

893
01:20:39,747 --> 01:20:40,874
not to invite you for dinner

894
01:20:40,916 --> 01:20:42,315
What do you mean more or less
This is less!

895
01:20:42,418 --> 01:20:44,682
Yeah... don't get mad, I'm hurrying

896
01:20:46,355 --> 01:20:47,618
You have to soak the honey banana
ball plates in hot water

897
01:20:47,657 --> 01:20:50,626
Don't just scrape them!

898
01:20:50,660 --> 01:20:53,151
You break the plate, you pay for it!
Yes...

899
01:20:53,329 --> 01:20:54,261
Hey, Boss

900
01:20:54,297 --> 01:20:57,358
Do us a favor, let's quit selling
those dick-haired honey banana balls?

901
01:20:57,401 --> 01:20:59,665
It's hard for us to make and
hard for him to wash. It's not worth it

902
01:20:59,704 --> 01:21:01,639
I'll decide if it's worth it

903
01:21:01,673 --> 01:21:03,971
If you don't like making them
go work somewhere else

904
01:21:04,743 --> 01:21:06,404
Just a good-hearted suggestion

905
01:21:07,279 --> 01:21:07,904
Thanks!

906
01:21:08,748 --> 01:21:10,113
What are you three guys stuck here for?

907
01:21:10,149 --> 01:21:10,877
Waiting for bowls

908
01:21:11,317 --> 01:21:12,750
Can't you do something else while you wait?

909
01:21:12,785 --> 01:21:14,082
Are your brain dead?

910
01:21:14,253 --> 01:21:15,220
There's nothing else to do!

911
01:21:15,789 --> 01:21:16,687
Are the Mu Shu Pork pancakes steamed?

912
01:21:16,724 --> 01:21:17,748
In the steamer

913
01:21:17,791 --> 01:21:18,348
The pickled cabbage is out

914
01:21:18,392 --> 01:21:19,757
The wontons are boiling

915
01:21:19,793 --> 01:21:21,727
the forks are cleaned

916
01:21:21,762 --> 01:21:23,196
the tables are cleared
the checks are paid

917
01:21:57,136 --> 01:21:57,762
Chu

918
01:21:58,838 --> 01:21:59,930
here's today's pay

919
01:22:00,874 --> 01:22:01,431
Thank you

920
01:22:03,009 --> 01:22:05,171
This isn't working out

921
01:22:05,546 --> 01:22:06,513
Don't come tomorrow

922
01:22:06,847 --> 01:22:08,109
I'll find someone else

923
01:22:08,783 --> 01:22:10,751
Boss he's going okay now

924
01:22:11,152 --> 01:22:12,177
Enough

925
01:22:12,554 --> 01:22:14,351
No Problem

926
01:22:14,856 --> 01:22:16,084
there were enough dishes

927
01:22:16,124 --> 01:22:17,091
What do you mean enough dishes?
No problem?

928
01:22:17,125 --> 01:22:19,390
It was only after the dinner rush hour

929
01:22:19,428 --> 01:22:21,760
that thing returned to normal

930
01:22:21,798 --> 01:22:23,891
Don't plead for him because he's old

931
01:22:25,903 --> 01:22:27,530
Lots of young guys would fight for the chance

932
01:22:27,571 --> 01:22:29,471
to make 700 dollars a month washing dishes

933
01:22:29,506 --> 01:22:30,837
Why should I have an old man?

934
01:22:30,874 --> 01:22:32,775
I'm not running an old folks home

935
01:22:33,344 --> 01:22:36,108
Boss, please give me another chance

936
01:22:36,181 --> 01:22:38,581
We all have to start somewhere. Right?

937
01:22:41,587 --> 01:22:43,885
Okay... One more chance

938
01:22:43,923 --> 01:22:44,890
Thank you

939
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:14,760
Is Sergeant Warren there?

940
01:25:15,663 --> 01:25:18,598
It's Alex Chu... yes

941
01:25:19,734 --> 01:25:20,962
No?

942
01:25:26,108 --> 01:25:28,008
Thanks Sargeant. Bye bye

943
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:50,801
Linda. It's Alex

944
01:25:52,071 --> 01:25:56,167
Let's have a talk... about the house

945
01:26:00,747 --> 01:26:05,048
Hey, congratulations on your review:
You're a bold new voice in women's fiction

946
01:26:05,086 --> 01:26:06,110
Better late then never

947
01:26:06,154 --> 01:26:08,452
I'm really proud of you, although

948
01:26:08,489 --> 01:26:11,550
the whole thing makes me feel like I should quit
my job and become a painter

949
01:26:13,829 --> 01:26:16,059
In the meantime, all I do is eat

950
01:26:16,198 --> 01:26:17,165
Maybe you're pregnant

951
01:26:18,268 --> 01:26:21,431
Sure, if you believe in immaculate conception

952
01:26:23,740 --> 01:26:26,039
I'm even thinking of going to my high
school reunion to see

953
01:26:26,077 --> 01:26:27,772
if there's any aging jocks still available

954
01:26:28,079 --> 01:26:28,602
Linda!

955
01:26:30,414 --> 01:26:33,714
Well at least I have my work
How's yours coming?

956
01:26:34,219 --> 01:26:35,277
Two chapters this week

957
01:26:35,420 --> 01:26:37,786
Oh, more travails of sturdy pioneer women

958
01:26:38,256 --> 01:26:40,487
Actually, I've written in a Chinese family

959
01:26:40,526 --> 01:26:42,391
The father brought over to work
on the railroads

960
01:26:42,428 --> 01:26:45,090
Don't tell me you miss the old geezer?

961
01:26:45,666 --> 01:26:46,496
Of course not

962
01:26:47,067 --> 01:26:47,726
Runaway Grandpa

963
01:26:47,768 --> 01:26:50,134
I am gonna have nightmares
for the rest of my life

964
01:26:50,170 --> 01:26:52,638
imagining his face
on the side of my milk carton

965
01:26:53,208 --> 01:26:54,197
It's sad

966
01:26:55,110 --> 01:26:56,134
And Alex...

967
01:26:56,177 --> 01:26:57,144
He blames you, does he?

968
01:26:57,345 --> 01:27:01,282
No, he's just anxious. I blame myself

969
01:27:08,859 --> 01:27:10,417
How can I let you do this?

970
01:27:10,460 --> 01:27:12,325
You'd better do your own work

971
01:27:12,696 --> 01:27:14,221
Don't worry about me

972
01:27:14,265 --> 01:27:15,823
Once I get busy
I won't be able to help you anyway

973
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:18,095
Wu, thanks a lot

974
01:27:18,136 --> 01:27:19,501
but everyone's got work to do

975
01:27:19,537 --> 01:27:21,563
Don't treat me special. I'll manage

976
01:27:23,175 --> 01:27:25,507
Chu, this is for you, I got someone

977
01:27:26,211 --> 01:27:27,439
Boss, I've been doing all right

978
01:27:32,218 --> 01:27:34,345
Eight bowls, five plates

979
01:27:34,721 --> 01:27:35,882
it's only 6:30p.m.

980
01:27:36,257 --> 01:27:37,724
You need those two to help you

981
01:27:38,125 --> 01:27:39,183
What happens at 7:30

982
01:27:39,226 --> 01:27:41,923
when the guests are lined up outside the door?

983
01:27:42,130 --> 01:27:44,428
He didn't ask for help, we volunteered

984
01:27:44,633 --> 01:27:46,294
You volunteered, fine!
He asked for help, fine!

985
01:27:46,334 --> 01:27:48,598
I don't care. I can't take any risks tonight

986
01:27:48,637 --> 01:27:51,198
Liu go downstairs and get yourself an apron

987
01:27:52,542 --> 01:27:54,669
Here's ten dollars. Take it or leave it

988
01:27:54,744 --> 01:27:57,509
Boss, why do you have to treat
an old man this way?

989
01:27:57,915 --> 01:27:59,780
I'll wash faster

990
01:28:01,285 --> 01:28:03,117
Not just faster but clean too!

991
01:28:03,154 --> 01:28:05,145
Come on, cut the crap, go!

992
01:28:05,190 --> 01:28:07,385
This is money

993
01:28:08,159 --> 01:28:09,183
Have you heard that before?

994
01:28:10,596 --> 01:28:12,689
Probably not, being from the mainland

995
01:28:13,299 --> 01:28:15,824
I know everything's shared there.
Working more gets you nothing

996
01:28:15,868 --> 01:28:18,702
Four decades of such thinking produced

997
01:28:18,738 --> 01:28:19,568
all you lazy bums

998
01:28:21,408 --> 01:28:22,602
Who are you calling a lazy bum?

999
01:28:23,743 --> 01:28:25,405
Eh? What's wrong? You don't accept that?

1000
01:28:25,813 --> 01:28:28,281
Then go back to China and live off
your relatives. Go on!

1001
01:28:28,349 --> 01:28:29,441
No one's stopping you

1002
01:28:29,884 --> 01:28:31,876
I'm telling you, this is America

1003
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:33,444
There's no communal property

1004
01:28:33,488 --> 01:28:34,420
You have to earn everything

1005
01:28:34,456 --> 01:28:36,481
yourself!

1006
01:28:36,558 --> 01:28:38,925
If you want to be American
then why don't you go all the way

1007
01:28:38,962 --> 01:28:40,054
and buy a dishwasher

1008
01:28:40,096 --> 01:28:41,393
It'll wash faster and cleaner

1009
01:28:41,931 --> 01:28:45,925
Yeah! I'm offering you ten dollars

1010
01:28:45,970 --> 01:28:47,801
because I respect your age

1011
01:28:47,972 --> 01:28:49,701
I'm saving face for you

1012
01:28:49,740 --> 01:28:50,934
if you don't want that

1013
01:28:51,208 --> 01:28:52,267
I'll throw you out!

1014
01:28:53,378 --> 01:28:55,403
See if you can

1015
01:28:56,214 --> 01:28:58,341
Don't think I won't touch you
because you're old

1016
01:28:58,817 --> 01:29:00,285
Come try me!

1017
01:29:00,720 --> 01:29:03,985
If you can move me half a step
I won't say another word

1018
01:29:04,023 --> 01:29:05,957
I'll turn and leave

1019
01:29:06,226 --> 01:29:07,352
Don't

1020
01:29:12,599 --> 01:29:14,295
So the old geezer knows kung-fu

1021
01:29:14,669 --> 01:29:16,728
No wonder you dared be so arrogant with me!

1022
01:29:20,276 --> 01:29:22,244
Oww! Li, Wu, help me!

1023
01:29:22,745 --> 01:29:23,769
I'm not getting involved in this

1024
01:29:24,847 --> 01:29:26,872
Cooks, Chang, Chien, get over here!

1025
01:29:26,982 --> 01:29:29,315
Boss, this is none of our business

1026
01:29:29,819 --> 01:29:31,309
Do you want to keep working here?

1027
01:29:32,822 --> 01:29:33,686
Quick

1028
01:29:38,963 --> 01:29:41,558
Old Chu, don't get angry

1029
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:42,965
but we've all got families to take care of

1030
01:29:43,702 --> 01:29:45,067
We'll just move you half a step, okay?

1031
01:29:45,637 --> 01:29:47,400
Then the business will keep going
Everyone, thank you

1032
01:29:48,441 --> 01:29:49,908
Come on, careful now

1033
01:29:52,912 --> 01:29:53,810
Get him!

1034
01:29:54,847 --> 01:29:56,315
Liu, help out!

1035
01:29:56,350 --> 01:29:56,748
Wu, help!

1036
01:29:59,720 --> 01:30:00,880
Go and help

1037
01:30:21,645 --> 01:30:25,082
Chu, you're a hero. We can't move you

1038
01:30:25,116 --> 01:30:26,777
We brothers apologize

1039
01:30:28,386 --> 01:30:31,413
Boss Huang, we quit

1040
01:30:31,990 --> 01:30:37,053
Go find yourself some of those thick-
skinned types with big muscles

1041
01:30:37,096 --> 01:30:38,462
I can't take this

1042
01:30:40,467 --> 01:30:43,402
Hey, you can't all leave!

1043
01:30:44,805 --> 01:30:46,966
Okay! I'm calling every employment agency!

1044
01:30:47,007 --> 01:30:49,407
Don't think you'll work in New York again!

1045
01:30:49,944 --> 01:30:51,377
Fuck you!

1046
01:30:53,482 --> 01:30:55,814
All right tough guy!
The business is closed tonight

1047
01:30:55,851 --> 01:30:57,910
But I'm calling the cops on you!

1048
01:30:57,953 --> 01:31:00,821
I don't have a green card
You hired me illegally

1049
01:31:00,857 --> 01:31:02,381
They'll fine you three thousand dollars

1050
01:31:02,759 --> 01:31:03,487
I'm telling you

1051
01:31:03,526 --> 01:31:06,553
I'll move you without the cops!

1052
01:31:16,508 --> 01:31:18,499
Thank you, come again

1053
01:31:46,208 --> 01:31:49,076
Grab him! He's like an eel

1054
01:31:49,646 --> 01:31:50,613
He's like a slimy fish

1055
01:32:12,772 --> 01:32:14,706
Yeah, I've seen this kind before

1056
01:33:15,043 --> 01:33:17,238
Ten police officers from the Fifth Precinct

1057
01:33:17,279 --> 01:33:21,614
were injured earlier this evening
in a brawl inside a Chinatown restaurant

1058
01:33:21,651 --> 01:33:22,811
Helen Wong reports

1059
01:33:23,786 --> 01:33:26,221
Shirley, I'm standing
in front of the Lai Fu restaurant

1060
01:33:26,423 --> 01:33:27,321
The owner Frankie Huang

1061
01:33:27,357 --> 01:33:30,622
tried to fire his 70-year old dishwasher
here earlier this evening

1062
01:33:30,694 --> 01:33:32,753
But Huang got more than he bargained for

1063
01:33:32,796 --> 01:33:36,733
Because the man he tried to fire, Mr. Chu
refused to leave the restaurant

1064
01:33:36,834 --> 01:33:37,493
Alex

1065
01:33:37,535 --> 01:33:39,799
Police said that Mr. Chu is a Tai Chi master

1066
01:33:39,837 --> 01:33:43,569
and he let lose a 130 pounds
of martial arts fury

1067
01:33:43,609 --> 01:33:45,804
on more than a dozen of New York's finest

1068
01:33:45,978 --> 01:33:50,143
Now it appears that Mr. Chu's being led
out of the restaurant by police

1069
01:33:50,183 --> 01:33:55,588
and is being put into a squad car
and taken down to the precinct and arrested

1070
01:33:56,190 --> 01:34:00,024
Reporting live, this is Helen Wong
now back to you in the studio

1071
01:34:36,302 --> 01:34:38,362
He's been like this
ever since he came in

1072
01:34:38,705 --> 01:34:40,696
The entire time he's been here

1073
01:34:40,741 --> 01:34:43,677
he hasn't said anything
nor has he had anything to eat or drink

1074
01:34:44,812 --> 01:34:48,612
I tell you I don't know
if he's meditating or sleeping

1075
01:34:55,791 --> 01:34:56,985
If you don't mind me saying so Mr. Chu

1076
01:34:57,026 --> 01:34:59,359
it's, it's kind of depressing

1077
01:35:06,637 --> 01:35:08,696
I'll let you go in and talk to him

1078
01:35:09,073 --> 01:35:09,903
Thank you, Officer

1079
01:35:10,641 --> 01:35:11,266
Any time

1080
01:35:27,728 --> 01:35:28,752
Dad

1081
01:35:37,072 --> 01:35:40,975
Ah, attaining nothingness isn't easy

1082
01:35:43,746 --> 01:35:45,236
Dad, we've bought a new house

1083
01:35:46,015 --> 01:35:47,108
it's much bigger than the old one

1084
01:35:48,452 --> 01:35:49,316
What for?

1085
01:35:50,687 --> 01:35:52,086
I'm here to take you home

1086
01:35:52,122 --> 01:35:54,956
Home? Whose home?

1087
01:35:56,694 --> 01:35:58,059
My home is your home!

1088
01:35:59,197 --> 01:36:02,224
Forget it. I see clearly now

1089
01:36:03,268 --> 01:36:05,702
the only thing that matters
is that you have a happy life

1090
01:36:06,305 --> 01:36:08,740
If you want to show me some filial respect

1091
01:36:10,076 --> 01:36:11,475
get me

1092
01:36:12,145 --> 01:36:16,276
an apartment in Chinatown

1093
01:36:17,284 --> 01:36:21,915
Let me peacefully pass my days there
disciplining my spirit

1094
01:36:23,291 --> 01:36:24,781
In your free time bring the boy to see me

1095
01:36:25,260 --> 01:36:27,228
This way when we get together

1096
01:36:28,797 --> 01:36:32,859
there'll still be some good feelings

1097
01:36:35,438 --> 01:36:39,466
Dad

1098
01:36:40,043 --> 01:36:42,739
all these years I've studied and worked hard

1099
01:36:42,846 --> 01:36:44,906
and built my family

1100
01:36:45,750 --> 01:36:48,310
in order that one day 
I could bring you to America

1101
01:36:49,254 --> 01:36:51,849
so you could have some good days in your life

1102
01:36:53,459 --> 01:36:54,323
Dad!

1103
01:37:07,842 --> 01:37:10,106
Alex, can you give a hand up here?

1104
01:37:10,211 --> 01:37:12,510
Okay, coming up

1105
01:37:19,823 --> 01:37:20,790
Is this straight?

1106
01:37:21,591 --> 01:37:22,785
Lower in the left

1107
01:37:23,827 --> 01:37:25,021
Yeah, it's fine

1108
01:37:25,429 --> 01:37:27,363
Do you think he'll ever spend a night here?

1109
01:37:27,398 --> 01:37:31,061
Oh, yes. As long as Jeremy is here
Grandpa will visit

1110
01:37:31,268 --> 01:37:33,260
Jeremy wants to be a Tai Chi master

1111
01:37:33,305 --> 01:37:35,535
Why didn't you ever learn
any Tai Chi from your father?

1112
01:37:35,574 --> 01:37:39,238
You know, for Dad
Tai Chi was a way to escape from reality

1113
01:37:39,912 --> 01:37:42,779
Even when he did pushing hands, for him

1114
01:37:42,815 --> 01:37:44,840
it was a way to avoid other people

1115
01:37:45,084 --> 01:37:45,914
Pushing hands?

1116
01:37:46,553 --> 01:37:49,454
Yeah, it's like Tai Chi for two

1117
01:37:50,891 --> 01:37:52,950
A way of keeping your balance

1118
01:37:53,060 --> 01:37:54,961
while unbalancing your opponent

1119
01:37:54,996 --> 01:37:57,362
Like marriage... only kidding

1120
01:37:57,832 --> 01:37:59,322
Okay, you stand like this...

1121
01:38:01,370 --> 01:38:02,428
Balanced?
Yep

1122
01:38:02,538 --> 01:38:04,472
If you try to unbalance me

1123
01:38:04,506 --> 01:38:06,337
I simply avoid your energy

1124
01:38:06,375 --> 01:38:08,139
and turn it back on you

1125
01:38:13,116 --> 01:38:13,980
Relax

1126
01:38:16,587 --> 01:38:19,249
Don't resist and don't break contact

1127
01:38:21,927 --> 01:38:23,019
Feel it?

1128
01:38:24,963 --> 01:38:27,363
Step out and collect

1129
01:38:27,666 --> 01:38:31,068
Moving up on left

1130
01:38:31,905 --> 01:38:35,672
Collect and moving up

1131
01:38:36,110 --> 01:38:37,873
Turn to right

1132
01:38:37,912 --> 01:38:41,939
Hugging your back

1133
01:38:41,982 --> 01:38:44,645
Hand down

1134
01:38:45,620 --> 01:38:47,611
Turn back and attack

1135
01:38:48,423 --> 01:38:50,619
Get back

1136
01:38:50,660 --> 01:38:53,322
Spread your legs

1137
01:38:53,362 --> 01:38:56,526
Get in

1138
01:38:57,567 --> 01:38:58,431
Squat down

1139
01:38:59,236 --> 01:39:02,694
Collect

1140
01:39:04,008 --> 01:39:06,033
Swing hands and step forward

1141
01:39:07,045 --> 01:39:08,637
Moving forward

1142
01:39:09,948 --> 01:39:13,077
Get in and spread your fingers

1143
01:39:13,986 --> 01:39:15,977
Step back and collect

1144
01:39:16,989 --> 01:39:18,981
Hook

1145
01:39:19,559 --> 01:39:20,958
Get in

1146
01:39:21,928 --> 01:39:23,418
Sweep

1147
01:39:26,267 --> 01:39:27,427
Turn hands

1148
01:39:28,602 --> 01:39:30,001
Single whip

1149
01:39:35,677 --> 01:39:36,575
Very good...

1150
01:39:39,649 --> 01:39:41,742
Relax, relax your whole body

1151
01:39:52,062 --> 01:39:54,725
Relax your hips and get lower down

1152
01:39:57,235 --> 01:39:59,066
Relax...

1153
01:40:00,473 --> 01:40:03,101
Good, raise your arms up

1154
01:40:03,976 --> 01:40:05,409
Relax a little with your
eyes looking into the distance

1155
01:40:05,611 --> 01:40:09,013
Mrs. Chen, long time no see

1156
01:40:09,116 --> 01:40:11,107
You've come a long way to buy groceries

1157
01:40:11,151 --> 01:40:12,778
No, not far. I live in the area

1158
01:40:13,755 --> 01:40:14,949
Your daughter moved?

1159
01:40:14,989 --> 01:40:16,149
No, I moved

1160
01:40:16,991 --> 01:40:19,755
That's great! Living on your own, you're free

1161
01:40:19,794 --> 01:40:21,228
You can do whatever you want

1162
01:40:22,197 --> 01:40:24,529
I just finished shopping

1163
01:40:24,566 --> 01:40:27,626
saw it was early and decided
to stop by your class

1164
01:40:28,004 --> 01:40:30,097
How did you know I was teaching here?

1165
01:40:31,374 --> 01:40:33,137
Wow! Who doesn't know about
the hero old Mr. Chu

1166
01:40:33,176 --> 01:40:35,042
famous all over Chinatown

1167
01:40:36,347 --> 01:40:37,609
The TV news showed that you knocked flat

1168
01:40:37,648 --> 01:40:40,082
a gang of American police and Chinese hoodlums

1169
01:40:41,685 --> 01:40:42,983
From what I can see if

1170
01:40:43,021 --> 01:40:44,989
Tai Chi Chuan could be practised upside down

1171
01:40:45,023 --> 01:40:46,490
the ceiling of this old age centre

1172
01:40:46,525 --> 01:40:48,789
would be packed with your students

1173
01:40:49,529 --> 01:40:51,360
You're making fun of me!

1174
01:40:51,431 --> 01:40:53,058
I'm speaking the truth

1175
01:40:54,033 --> 01:40:54,727
did you make a fortune?

1176
01:40:55,468 --> 01:40:56,299
No way

1177
01:40:56,770 --> 01:41:00,536
Every morning I come here
and pass the time with the students

1178
01:41:01,675 --> 01:41:03,143
Anyway we old folks

1179
01:41:04,079 --> 01:41:06,639
have nothing but time to kill

1180
01:41:07,048 --> 01:41:09,642
I earn my own money

1181
01:41:09,751 --> 01:41:10,844
and don't take anybody's flack

1182
01:41:11,387 --> 01:41:14,015
That's why I always say

1183
01:41:14,056 --> 01:41:16,286
you can't hold everything inside

1184
01:41:16,325 --> 01:41:18,851
Sometimes you've got to lose your temper
to straighten things out

1185
01:41:19,129 --> 01:41:21,324
The kids are grown up

1186
01:41:22,065 --> 01:41:24,364
If we old folks don't
take care of ourselves

1187
01:41:24,402 --> 01:41:25,562
who will?

1188
01:41:27,105 --> 01:41:28,197
You're right

1189
01:41:29,273 --> 01:41:31,105
Is your shoulder better?

1190
01:41:31,176 --> 01:41:32,768
Better?

1191
01:41:33,112 --> 01:41:34,739
At my age, I just thank the heavens

1192
01:41:34,780 --> 01:41:36,247
that it doesn't get worse

1193
01:41:37,082 --> 01:41:38,345
I don't know kung-fu like you

1194
01:41:40,520 --> 01:41:42,215
But is it convenient living alone?

1195
01:41:43,389 --> 01:41:44,083
It's all right

1196
01:41:45,392 --> 01:41:47,155
My daughter comes to see me every two
or three weeks

1197
01:41:47,194 --> 01:41:50,288
when she goes shopping around here

1198
01:41:50,731 --> 01:41:52,256
she cooks and eats with me

1199
01:41:53,301 --> 01:41:57,328
Uhhhh. That's good. Alex
and his family do the same

1200
01:42:11,121 --> 01:42:12,383
You'd better take care of your students
I'm leaving now

1201
01:42:13,191 --> 01:42:14,453
When you're free, stop by

1202
01:42:15,226 --> 01:42:17,694
We're neighbours now

1203
01:42:17,729 --> 01:42:19,321
Well, take care

1204
01:42:20,199 --> 01:42:20,722
You too

1205
01:42:47,930 --> 01:42:48,693
Mrs. Chen!

1206
01:42:51,534 --> 01:42:52,501
Why did you come out?

1207
01:42:53,770 --> 01:42:55,295
To see if you had left

1208
01:42:56,173 --> 01:42:58,437
The sun is so pleasant today

1209
01:42:58,676 --> 01:42:59,734
I was thinking, I'm just one person

1210
01:42:59,910 --> 01:43:03,176
I could go home or stay out
both would be good

1211
01:43:03,215 --> 01:43:05,615
Anyway, standing here I got lost in thought

1212
01:43:05,784 --> 01:43:06,580
Where do you live?

1213
01:43:07,285 --> 01:43:09,379
I live in that building, number 1068

1214
01:43:10,256 --> 01:43:13,191
I live in that building, number 20101

1215
01:43:14,594 --> 01:43:15,788
Stop by for a visit sometime

1216
01:43:17,364 --> 01:43:18,592
Do you have anything to do this afternoon?

1217
01:43:20,334 --> 01:43:24,465
Uh... Nothing
