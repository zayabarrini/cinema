1
00:02:57,656 --> 00:03:00,489
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen!

2
00:03:00,593 --> 00:03:04,085
This train, originating from
New York's Grand Central Station...

3
00:03:04,196 --> 00:03:06,096
is back in service.

4
00:03:06,198 --> 00:03:08,689
Next stop will be
New Canaan, Connecticut.

5
00:03:08,801 --> 00:03:11,668
<i>New Canaan, Connecticut,
next stop.

6
00:03:25,584 --> 00:03:28,417
<i>In issue number 141 of The Fantastic Four...

7
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,717
<i>published in November 1973...

8
00:03:31,824 --> 00:03:35,988
<i>Reed Richards has to use
his antimatter weapon on his own son...

9
00:03:36,095 --> 00:03:40,031
<i>who Annihilus has turned into
a human atom bomb.

10
00:03:40,132 --> 00:03:42,726
<i>It was a typical predicament
for the Fantastic Four...

11
00:03:42,835 --> 00:03:45,702
<i>because they weren't
like other superheroes.

12
00:03:45,804 --> 00:03:47,704
<i>They were more like a family...

13
00:03:47,806 --> 00:03:50,741
<i>and the more power they had,
the more harm they could do to each other...

14
00:03:50,843 --> 00:03:52,834
<i>without even knowing it.

15
00:03:52,945 --> 00:03:55,345
<i>That was the meaning
of The Fantastic Four...

16
00:03:55,447 --> 00:03:59,383
<i>that a family is like
your own personal antimatter.

17
00:03:59,485 --> 00:04:04,252
<i>Your family is the void you emerge from
and the place you return to when you die.

18
00:04:05,691 --> 00:04:07,591
<i>And that's the paradox...

19
00:04:07,693 --> 00:04:09,593
<i>the closer you're drawn back in...

20
00:04:09,695 --> 00:04:11,822
<i>the deeper into the void you go.

21
00:04:37,022 --> 00:04:39,490
<i>The dilemma that Dostoyevsky...

22
00:04:39,591 --> 00:04:41,491
<i>claims here to have discovered...

23
00:04:41,593 --> 00:04:45,689
<i>goes to the very core
of Christianity's relationship...

24
00:04:45,798 --> 00:04:47,561
to the modern world.

25
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:49,634
But it is a dilemma that...
Yes, Libbets?

26
00:04:50,736 --> 00:04:55,139
<i>What Dostoyevsky is saying here
is that to be a Christian is to choose...

27
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,141
because you have to choose
of your own choice.

28
00:04:58,243 --> 00:05:01,406
<i>And since you can't choose to do good
because that'd be too rational...

29
00:05:01,513 --> 00:05:03,606
you have to choose to do bad.

30
00:05:03,716 --> 00:05:05,911
It's existential.

31
00:05:06,018 --> 00:05:09,510
<i>Thank you, Libbets.
That's a very compelling summary.

32
00:05:09,621 --> 00:05:12,852
<i>But, of course,
existentialism, as you said...

33
00:05:15,627 --> 00:05:18,494
Libbets? Hey.

34
00:05:18,597 --> 00:05:22,260
Dostoyevsky.
I'm also really a fan.

35
00:05:22,367 --> 00:05:24,665
<i>And what you were saying,
you know...

36
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:27,432
<i>Have you ever read The Idiot?

37
00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:29,439
<i>The Idiot?

38
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:33,272
<i>If you liked Notes from Underground,
you'll love The Idiot.

39
00:05:34,379 --> 00:05:36,279
Great. Thanks for the tip.

40
00:05:38,517 --> 00:05:40,485
<i>The Idiot.

41
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,584
<i>- I'm in love with Libbets Casey.
- Oh, come on.

42
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:47,682
She's a poor little rich girl.
Check out the jeans and fur look.

43
00:05:47,793 --> 00:05:50,523
And get a load of this.

44
00:05:50,629 --> 00:05:53,962
Her mom, step-dad and stepsisters are going
to Switzerland to ski over Thanksgiving break...

45
00:05:54,066 --> 00:05:55,966
and they didn't invite her.

46
00:05:56,068 --> 00:05:59,037
- How do you know this shit?
- They did it last year too.

47
00:05:59,138 --> 00:06:00,628
It's, like, traditional or something.

48
00:06:00,739 --> 00:06:03,367
They've got this humongoid place
in New York City...

49
00:06:03,475 --> 00:06:06,603
and she just holes up there
with a wad of cash.

50
00:06:06,712 --> 00:06:09,613
You think Francis is gonna
beat me to the punch here?

51
00:06:09,715 --> 00:06:13,947
Since he sleeps with every girl
you ever show an interest in...

52
00:06:14,052 --> 00:06:17,954
why don't you just keep
your Libbets fixation a secret from him?

53
00:06:18,056 --> 00:06:21,423
<i>You already told him.

54
00:06:25,764 --> 00:06:29,825
I hope you changed the water
in that bong from last night.

55
00:06:29,935 --> 00:06:33,769
The water, as you call it, is a special mixture
of amaretto and brandy...

56
00:06:33,872 --> 00:06:36,534
blended for just the exact
chemical interaction...

57
00:06:36,642 --> 00:06:39,873
with the last
of our precious Thai stick.

58
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:50,420
Waste not, Master Hood!
That was 20 for the bag!

59
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,985
I been thinking, Francis.

60
00:06:57,095 --> 00:07:01,657
You know, you are one
drug-addled, elitist freak.

61
00:07:01,767 --> 00:07:03,667
<i>And when the revolution comes...

62
00:07:03,769 --> 00:07:05,999
<i>I do not want to be
lined up with you and shot...

63
00:07:06,104 --> 00:07:09,631
because you are fucking ripe
for political reeducation.

64
00:07:09,741 --> 00:07:12,801
<i>- You know? Like in the fields.
- Let me enlighten you about something here.

65
00:07:12,911 --> 00:07:17,644
You and I exist on two opposite sides
of a great existential divide...

66
00:07:17,749 --> 00:07:20,149
that being your pathetic virginity
on the one hand...

67
00:07:20,252 --> 00:07:23,517
<i>and my astonishing number
of sexual conquests on the other.

68
00:07:23,622 --> 00:07:25,852
<i>You are simply jealous.

69
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:28,222
<i>Hood. Telephone.

70
00:07:28,327 --> 00:07:31,228
And remember, with your erogenous zones
lubricated as such with the mighty herb...

71
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:35,232
beware out there, because you drone on
like a motherfucker when you're stoned.

72
00:07:35,334 --> 00:07:37,302
Flame on, asshole.

73
00:07:45,978 --> 00:07:48,071
- Hello?
- Paul?

74
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,740
- Oh. Hi, Dad.
- Hey, guy.

75
00:07:50,849 --> 00:07:52,840
How's it going?
Everything all right up there?

76
00:07:52,951 --> 00:07:55,385
- Yeah. Everything's good.
- Well, good.

77
00:07:55,487 --> 00:08:00,151
Well, I'm just confirming
you'll be on the 4:40 on Wednesday, right?

78
00:08:00,259 --> 00:08:02,193
I'm gonna come Thursday.

79
00:08:02,294 --> 00:08:05,422
Well, you can't come on Thursday, Paul,
because Thursday's already Thanksgiving.

80
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:07,896
<i>But a record which
would only be disclosed...

81
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,230
<i>Well, that's the whole point
of the holidays, Raul.

82
00:08:10,335 --> 00:08:12,769
So you and your sister
can mope around the house...

83
00:08:12,871 --> 00:08:15,169
and your mother and I
can wait on you hand and foot...

84
00:08:15,274 --> 00:08:17,742
while the two of you
occasionally grunt for more food...

85
00:08:17,843 --> 00:08:19,936
from behind the hair in your faces.

86
00:08:20,045 --> 00:08:23,845
- Believe it or not, we actually enjoy it.
- Okay, okay, Dad.

87
00:08:23,949 --> 00:08:27,544
<i>- Good. Thanks, guy. Hang on a second.
- First, the investigation should be thorough.

88
00:08:27,653 --> 00:08:29,621
Wendy, you want to say hi
to your brother?

89
00:08:29,721 --> 00:08:32,747
<i>- And second, that if there were any military involvement...
- Wendy, come on!

90
00:08:32,858 --> 00:08:36,259
<i>We should get the facts out first.

91
00:08:36,361 --> 00:08:38,761
<i>As I said at my August 29
press conference last...

92
00:08:38,864 --> 00:08:42,493
- Charles.
- Charles, have you been keeping out of my shit?

93
00:08:42,601 --> 00:08:45,866
Have you refrained from entering
the sacred precincts of my room?

94
00:08:45,971 --> 00:08:48,838
I haven't touched your sh... stuff.

95
00:08:48,941 --> 00:08:51,432
- Are you watching this?
- Watching what?

96
00:08:51,543 --> 00:08:55,001
Nixon, doofus. It's incredible.
He should be shot.

97
00:08:55,113 --> 00:08:58,014
Hey. Drop the political
assassination stuff, please.

98
00:08:58,116 --> 00:09:02,610
He's a liar. Dean told him on March 21
about Kalmbach and Hunt...

99
00:09:02,721 --> 00:09:05,053
all about the payoffs
to the Watergate burglars.

100
00:09:05,157 --> 00:09:07,751
So you tell me where
the so-called Dean Report is.

101
00:09:07,859 --> 00:09:11,056
- But you can't because it doesn't exist.
- All right. The defense rests.

102
00:09:14,366 --> 00:09:16,493
- You want another?
- No, thank you.

103
00:09:17,536 --> 00:09:20,733
- We should be off.
- Got you.

104
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:23,364
<i>And the only person knows
that when the March 24th tape...

105
00:09:23,475 --> 00:09:26,342
Charles? Charles, calm down.
I wasn't in on it.

106
00:09:26,445 --> 00:09:29,710
It's gonna sink, and the entire country
will fall into anarchy.

107
00:09:29,815 --> 00:09:32,716
- And the Symbionese Liberation Army...
- Dinner's on the counter.

108
00:09:32,818 --> 00:09:35,753
We'll be at the Carvers'.
You know the number.

109
00:09:35,854 --> 00:09:38,687
- Paul, hi!
- Hi.

110
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:40,781
Hi. Is there
anything special you want?

111
00:09:40,892 --> 00:09:44,020
Any particular kind of food or snack
or anything we can stock up on?

112
00:09:44,129 --> 00:09:45,926
- Nope.
- No? You're all right?

113
00:09:46,031 --> 00:09:48,499
- Yeah, I'm good.
- Yeah? Okay. All right.

114
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,125
We'll see you next week. I love you.

115
00:09:51,236 --> 00:09:53,136
Me too.

116
00:09:53,238 --> 00:09:55,297
All right. Bye-bye.

117
00:09:55,407 --> 00:09:58,103
- All right, Wendy. We'll see you later.
- Asleep by 10:00.

118
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:00,110
I mean it, young lady.

119
00:10:00,212 --> 00:10:02,806
As a matter of fact
I have a practice...

120
00:10:02,914 --> 00:10:04,882
whenever I'm not too tired at night...

121
00:10:04,983 --> 00:10:07,349
<i>Of dictating my own recollections of the day.

122
00:10:07,452 --> 00:10:11,320
I think that, perhaps, will be the more
accurate record of history in the end.

123
00:10:15,394 --> 00:10:18,363
The dog jumps up on the barstool,
and he says, "Okay."

124
00:10:18,463 --> 00:10:22,297
<i>It was a benefit
for the A.C.L.U. or something.

125
00:10:22,401 --> 00:10:24,301
Harry Reems himself was there.

126
00:10:24,403 --> 00:10:27,201
<i>The man with the...
from Deep Throat.

127
00:10:27,305 --> 00:10:29,865
- The very one.
- Classic.

128
00:10:29,975 --> 00:10:32,569
<i>- Something about a First Amendment defense fund.
- Ted took me to see it.

129
00:10:32,677 --> 00:10:34,508
<i>- I'm sorry.
- Oh, Ted, how romantic.

130
00:10:36,581 --> 00:10:39,209
- I have to admit the movie didn't do much for me.
- That's nice, son.

131
00:10:39,317 --> 00:10:43,515
But being in that theater, surrounded by all
those horny, young college boys and perverts...

132
00:10:43,622 --> 00:10:45,920
<i>- I mean, there was something in the air.
- Oh!

133
00:10:46,024 --> 00:10:48,390
- Oh, I'm sorry! Jesus!
- It's okay, sweetie.

134
00:10:48,493 --> 00:10:50,893
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- No, no, no. No problemo, Mikey.

135
00:10:50,996 --> 00:10:53,089
<i>- Don't worry about it.
- It's okay, Mikey. No problem.

136
00:10:53,198 --> 00:10:55,996
<i>Rut the wine down.
Just leave the wine on the table.

137
00:10:56,101 --> 00:10:58,831
<i>- Go ahead on in the kitchen.
- It's fine. It's fine.

138
00:10:58,937 --> 00:11:02,168
<i>- Nice save, Mikey.
- Sandy, help your brother, okay?

139
00:11:02,274 --> 00:11:04,174
<i>It's just... It's nothing.

140
00:11:04,276 --> 00:11:07,712
It's fine. Thanks.

141
00:11:07,813 --> 00:11:10,281
<i>- You need help with that?
- We changed our couples group.

142
00:11:10,382 --> 00:11:12,407
<i>Now we're in some geriatric group.

143
00:11:12,517 --> 00:11:16,078
<i>Though I must admit
there are a couple of lookers.

144
00:11:16,188 --> 00:11:19,055
But you two are still
sticking it out with Dr. Pasmier?

145
00:11:19,157 --> 00:11:22,456
Oh, actually, Ben decided that...
Well, I mean we both decided...

146
00:11:22,561 --> 00:11:25,155
<i>I just... I just don't see
what the appeal is.

147
00:11:25,263 --> 00:11:27,823
I mean, like Ted said,
people go in there...

148
00:11:27,933 --> 00:11:30,458
<i>and they just get themselves
all worked up, and...

149
00:11:30,569 --> 00:11:33,231
<i>That's the point.
Then they go home and make up.

150
00:11:33,338 --> 00:11:35,238
But Elena and I, we don't...

151
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,570
we don't go in for
those sort of histrionics.

152
00:11:37,676 --> 00:11:40,304
<i>About the only big fight
we've had in years...

153
00:11:40,412 --> 00:11:42,744
was about whether or not
to go back into couples therapy.

154
00:11:42,848 --> 00:11:46,579
<i>It appears you won.

155
00:11:57,996 --> 00:12:01,090
- Oh, please don't.
- It's not a bother.

156
00:12:01,199 --> 00:12:03,429
<i>I insist.

157
00:12:03,535 --> 00:12:06,231
Don't touch them.

158
00:12:06,338 --> 00:12:08,499
Oh.

159
00:12:08,607 --> 00:12:11,337
<i>It's really quite all right.

160
00:12:14,246 --> 00:12:16,908
Of course.

161
00:12:23,688 --> 00:12:26,350
<i>And to think,
they met at a key party, of all things.

162
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:28,426
A key party?

163
00:12:28,527 --> 00:12:31,462
Oh, you know, it's a California thing.

164
00:12:31,563 --> 00:12:35,761
<i>That scuzzy husband of hers dragged her kicking
and screaming to one when they were out in L.A.

165
00:12:35,867 --> 00:12:38,802
You know, the men put
their car keys in a bowl...

166
00:12:38,904 --> 00:12:42,032
and at the end of the evening,
the women line up and fish them out.

167
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:44,836
<i>And whoever's they've got,
they go home with.

168
00:12:44,943 --> 00:12:48,743
<i>Anyhow, that's how she met this Rod person,
or whatever his name is.

169
00:12:48,847 --> 00:12:51,509
<i>He's left his wife,
she's packing for California...

170
00:12:51,616 --> 00:12:53,675
and Irwin is devastated.

171
00:12:53,785 --> 00:12:57,186
- It's so ironic.
- Ironic?

172
00:12:58,957 --> 00:13:01,517
<i>Well... Yes, ironic.

173
00:13:01,626 --> 00:13:03,526
His name's Rod.

174
00:13:11,069 --> 00:13:14,505
No, come on.
He's like a big, infected whitehead.

175
00:13:14,606 --> 00:13:16,506
<i>I would never.

176
00:13:16,608 --> 00:13:18,576
Shit. It's my parents.

177
00:13:21,413 --> 00:13:24,041
<i>He's so gross.

178
00:13:24,149 --> 00:13:28,518
My drumstick was still frozen
when you, you know, cut inside there.

179
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:32,488
Probably gonna get whatever that disease...

180
00:13:34,226 --> 00:13:36,558
I knew it. Watch this.

181
00:13:39,664 --> 00:13:43,691
<i>- Dad, stop it!.
- Get to sleep, young lady. I mean it.

182
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:46,697
Fascist.

183
00:13:46,805 --> 00:13:51,071
If I were a fascist, I would have sent you to one of
those Southern military academies a long time ago.

184
00:13:51,176 --> 00:13:53,610
Now get to bed!

185
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,980
Hey.

186
00:14:04,589 --> 00:14:07,080
Hey, kiddo.

187
00:14:07,192 --> 00:14:09,092
Sleep well?

188
00:14:09,194 --> 00:14:11,094
Good night, Dad.

189
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:46,930
Ben.

190
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:41,351
Reduce its cash position...

191
00:15:41,453 --> 00:15:43,421
especially during this period
of inflation.

192
00:16:03,308 --> 00:16:06,004
- Elena? Elena Hood, am I right?
- Yes?

193
00:16:06,111 --> 00:16:09,842
Reverend Edwards. Philip Edwards. You came by and checked
out the congregation a couple of times last year.

194
00:16:09,948 --> 00:16:13,816
Oh, yes. It was...
I ended up...

195
00:16:13,918 --> 00:16:17,684
No need to make excuses.
We're not for everyone, I know.

196
00:16:18,723 --> 00:16:22,454
But I did think for a time
that you might be someone who...

197
00:16:23,528 --> 00:16:27,362
Well, what I mean is that you didn't seem to
think what we were trying to do is laughable...

198
00:16:27,465 --> 00:16:29,990
like some of your fellow citizens
around hereabouts.

199
00:16:30,101 --> 00:16:32,296
No. No, I... I didn't think it
laughable at all. I...

200
00:16:32,404 --> 00:16:36,363
Perhaps you find in books
what I try to find in people.

201
00:16:37,909 --> 00:16:40,139
That sounds vaguely like an insult.

202
00:16:40,245 --> 00:16:44,614
Oh. My, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it that way at all.

203
00:16:44,716 --> 00:16:48,447
Perhaps I meant it simply
as a... a provocation.

204
00:16:49,788 --> 00:16:51,983
<i>She's a total Young Republican.

205
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:55,890
She said that you licked Dave Brewster's
weenie in the third floor bathroom.

206
00:16:55,994 --> 00:17:00,260
She's lying. I wouldn't touch
Dave Brewster's dick if you paid me.

207
00:17:00,365 --> 00:17:03,391
It's probably crawling with V.D.
from when he stuck it in her.

208
00:17:03,501 --> 00:17:06,766
<i>Which he did.

209
00:17:06,871 --> 00:17:10,034
<i>Well, Donna said that her brother
and all his stupid friends were talking...

210
00:17:11,676 --> 00:17:14,304
<i>Come on!.

211
00:17:14,412 --> 00:17:17,074
<i>Go on out. Come on!.

212
00:17:29,494 --> 00:17:31,689
<i>Man!

213
00:17:33,364 --> 00:17:35,559
<i>Stoner!.

214
00:17:35,667 --> 00:17:38,636
<i>- Come on. Let's play ball.
- Get it, get it!

215
00:17:40,772 --> 00:17:44,299
<i>I suppose my reluctance
was the group aspect of it.

216
00:17:44,409 --> 00:17:46,604
I've never been much of a joiner.

217
00:17:46,711 --> 00:17:49,737
Although I still consider myself
a somewhat religious person.

218
00:17:49,848 --> 00:17:52,316
Well, I, of course, flatter myself
that our church is not exactly...

219
00:17:52,417 --> 00:17:54,942
what most people would call
"organized religion."

220
00:17:55,053 --> 00:17:58,147
At times, it's the disorganization
that's liberating.

221
00:17:58,256 --> 00:18:02,590
Of course, I've begun to minister much more in
what one might call therapeutic environments...

222
00:18:02,694 --> 00:18:04,594
in small groups and couples...

223
00:18:04,696 --> 00:18:06,596
and one-on-one.

224
00:18:06,698 --> 00:18:08,290
My daughter.

225
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:23,647
I haven't been on a bike for years.

226
00:18:26,851 --> 00:18:29,046
When was the last time
you rode a bike?

227
00:18:30,221 --> 00:18:32,348
They say you never forget.

228
00:19:20,805 --> 00:19:23,239
- Hi, Wendy.
- Hey, Sandy.

229
00:19:23,341 --> 00:19:25,809
- Mikey was looking for you.
- Oh, yeah? Okay.

230
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:27,810
See ya.

231
00:20:21,733 --> 00:20:23,701
Want some gum?

232
00:20:25,169 --> 00:20:27,137
- Devil Dog?
- Chewing.

233
00:20:30,975 --> 00:20:33,102
Did you tell Sandy?

234
00:20:33,211 --> 00:20:35,179
Tell Sandy what?

235
00:20:37,081 --> 00:20:39,379
You didn't tell him either, did you?

236
00:21:47,018 --> 00:21:51,978
<i>We were golfing. You know, golfing to me
is something I'm supposed to enjoy.

237
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:54,285
And I was on
the goddamn golf team in college...

238
00:21:54,392 --> 00:21:56,451
so it's something
one would assume I do well.

239
00:21:56,561 --> 00:21:58,188
I used to do well.

240
00:21:58,296 --> 00:22:00,457
But basically, these days,
golfing for me...

241
00:22:00,565 --> 00:22:02,999
is like hoeing or plowing.

242
00:22:03,101 --> 00:22:04,898
It's like farming.

243
00:22:05,002 --> 00:22:09,371
And George Clair has obviously, in the mere
two years since he's been with the firm...

244
00:22:09,474 --> 00:22:13,240
he has obviously been taking
secret lessons with a golf pro.

245
00:22:13,344 --> 00:22:15,972
And I bet the entirety
of his disposable income...

246
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:20,983
has been dedicated
to humiliating me on the golf course.

247
00:22:21,085 --> 00:22:23,815
And the guy talks nonstop...

248
00:22:23,921 --> 00:22:26,583
throughout the entirety
of the miserable 18 holes...

249
00:22:26,691 --> 00:22:29,683
- Ben.
- On topics that are the supposed domain of my department.

250
00:22:29,794 --> 00:22:32,422
- Ben.
- Yeah?

251
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:34,430
You're boring me.

252
00:22:35,533 --> 00:22:37,967
I have a husband.

253
00:22:38,069 --> 00:22:41,197
I don't particularly feel
the need for another.

254
00:22:43,608 --> 00:22:47,044
You have a point there.
That's a very good point.

255
00:22:47,145 --> 00:22:49,773
We're having an affair. Right.

256
00:22:49,881 --> 00:22:51,872
An explicitly sexual relationship.

257
00:22:51,983 --> 00:22:54,645
Your needs, my needs.
You're absolutely right.

258
00:22:54,752 --> 00:22:57,812
You'd better get dressed.
The boys will be home soon.

259
00:22:57,922 --> 00:22:59,549
Gotcha.

260
00:23:39,864 --> 00:23:41,764
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, Wendy.

261
00:23:43,367 --> 00:23:46,336
It's funny. When I was in town,
I saw you on your bike.

262
00:23:46,437 --> 00:23:48,735
- With Mikey?
- Who?

263
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,740
- Nobody.
- Mikey Carver?

264
00:23:50,842 --> 00:23:52,810
Oh, we were just riding around.

265
00:23:54,612 --> 00:23:57,513
Well, you looked very free
when I saw you.

266
00:23:57,615 --> 00:24:01,642
As if I were seeing my own memories
of being a girl.

267
00:24:03,888 --> 00:24:06,356
There was something internal about it.

268
00:24:07,425 --> 00:24:09,325
Mom?

269
00:24:09,427 --> 00:24:12,521
- Are you okay?
- Of course, Wendy. I'm sorry.

270
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:15,599
You must think I'm ripe
to be checked into Silver Meadows.

271
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:19,431
<i>- You're not a psycho.
- People at Silver Meadows aren't psychos.

272
00:24:19,537 --> 00:24:22,904
I know. They're rich drug addicts
and celebrities.

273
00:24:25,676 --> 00:24:28,144
They need the money at school
for my band uniform.

274
00:24:29,313 --> 00:24:32,510
I thought you quit the band.
I never hear you practice anymore.

275
00:24:32,617 --> 00:24:34,744
Yeah, well,
I don't really need to practice.

276
00:24:34,852 --> 00:24:39,084
I just play a few notes anyway,
so I figured I'd just stay in.

277
00:24:40,291 --> 00:24:44,227
Well I'm sure your father and I would
love to hear what you're playing these days.

278
00:24:44,328 --> 00:24:46,728
Maybe after dinner?

279
00:25:05,783 --> 00:25:10,083
The Halfords have invited us
again this year.

280
00:25:10,187 --> 00:25:12,155
<i>You want to go?

281
00:25:12,256 --> 00:25:15,453
- What do you think?
- Well, it's a neighborhood tradition.

282
00:25:16,794 --> 00:25:18,921
I'm... I'm gonna go to bed.

283
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:22,488
- So early?
- Rough day. Good night.

284
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,659
Is that a new aftershave?

285
00:25:24,769 --> 00:25:27,738
Yeah. Musk or something.

286
00:25:27,838 --> 00:25:30,329
You like it?

287
00:25:31,575 --> 00:25:33,543
- Good night.
- Good night.

288
00:25:51,162 --> 00:25:53,596
<i>- Hey, Mikey?
- Yeah.

289
00:25:55,333 --> 00:25:58,564
- Geometry?
- Sure. Anything but this English.

290
00:25:59,637 --> 00:26:02,629
How come you're so good at math,
but not at English?

291
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:05,436
I'm not good at math.
Just good at geometry.

292
00:26:06,844 --> 00:26:09,142
It's, like, you know,
when they say "two squared"...

293
00:26:09,246 --> 00:26:11,510
you think it means
"two times two equals four"?

294
00:26:11,615 --> 00:26:14,015
But really, they really mean a square.

295
00:26:14,118 --> 00:26:17,576
It's really space.
It's not numbers. It's space.

296
00:26:17,688 --> 00:26:20,919
And it's perfect space,
but only in your head...

297
00:26:21,025 --> 00:26:24,119
'cause you can't draw a perfect square
in the material world.

298
00:26:24,228 --> 00:26:27,755
But in your mind,
you can have perfect space.

299
00:26:27,865 --> 00:26:29,492
You know?

300
00:26:30,968 --> 00:26:33,266
Yeah.

301
00:26:33,371 --> 00:26:35,999
But I just need some help
with my homework.

302
00:26:42,546 --> 00:26:45,845
Hey, guys. I'm back.

303
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:47,850
You were gone?

304
00:26:50,688 --> 00:26:53,486
Yeah, Mikey. Yup.

305
00:26:53,591 --> 00:26:56,788
I was in Houston working on
some great new ideas about silicon.

306
00:26:56,894 --> 00:26:58,828
<i>Comes from sand.

307
00:26:58,929 --> 00:27:01,591
It's a semiconductor.

308
00:27:01,699 --> 00:27:03,667
So how you guys doin'?
How's school?

309
00:27:03,768 --> 00:27:07,397
I don't know.

310
00:27:07,505 --> 00:27:10,235
Okay, I guess.

311
00:27:13,911 --> 00:27:15,811
All right.

312
00:27:41,038 --> 00:27:42,938
Good trip?

313
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,940
You bet.

314
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,838
- Jim.
- Oh.

315
00:27:50,948 --> 00:27:53,576
- Jesus.
- I'm sorry.

316
00:27:55,686 --> 00:27:57,916
Hell, we gotta trade this thing in
for a normal bed.

317
00:27:58,022 --> 00:27:59,990
Just be careful.

318
00:28:01,425 --> 00:28:03,325
Okay.

319
00:28:06,197 --> 00:28:08,995
Have you noticed anything
with Mikey lately?

320
00:28:10,401 --> 00:28:13,097
The kid seemed
a little out of it tonight?

321
00:28:13,204 --> 00:28:17,504
Tonight? Mikey's been out of it
since he was born.

322
00:28:21,045 --> 00:28:24,014
Guess the kid takes after me?

323
00:28:36,193 --> 00:28:39,162
"Molecules.

324
00:28:39,263 --> 00:28:43,063
"Because of molecules, we are connected
to the outside world from our bodies.

325
00:28:43,167 --> 00:28:45,965
"Like when you smell things,
because when you smell a smell...

326
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:47,970
"it's not really a smell.

327
00:28:48,072 --> 00:28:52,304
"It's part of the object
that has come off of it... molecules.

328
00:28:52,409 --> 00:28:55,572
"So when you smell something bad,
it's like, in a way, you're eating it.

329
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:57,806
<i>"This is why you should not
really smell things...

330
00:28:57,915 --> 00:29:01,009
<i>"in the same way you don't eat
everything in the world around you...

331
00:29:01,118 --> 00:29:04,815
"because, as a smell,
it gets inside of you.

332
00:29:04,922 --> 00:29:08,824
"So the next time you go to the bathroom
after someone else has been there...

333
00:29:08,926 --> 00:29:12,453
<i>remember what kind of molecules
you are, in fact, eating. ".

334
00:31:07,044 --> 00:31:09,706
Mrs. Hood. Mrs. Hood.
Did you forget something?

335
00:31:09,813 --> 00:31:13,772
- No. What?
- Why don't we just come on in here?

336
00:31:15,886 --> 00:31:18,411
I think maybe you forgot something.

337
00:31:24,194 --> 00:31:26,560
<i>To find yourself
in the Negative Zone...

338
00:31:26,664 --> 00:31:29,394
<i>as the Fantastic Four often do...

339
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:32,264
<i>means that all everyday assumptions
are inverted.

340
00:31:32,369 --> 00:31:35,065
<i>Even the Invisible Girl herself
becomes visible...

341
00:31:35,172 --> 00:31:38,039
<i>and so she loses
the last semblance of her power.

342
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:43,847
<i>It seems to me that everyone exists
partially on a Negative Zone level...

343
00:31:43,947 --> 00:31:45,881
<i>some people more than others.

344
00:31:45,983 --> 00:31:48,577
<i>In your life, it's kind of like
you dip in and out of it...

345
00:31:48,686 --> 00:31:52,452
<i>the place where things don't quite
work out the way they should.

346
00:31:52,556 --> 00:31:56,515
<i>But for some people, there's something
about the Negative Zone that tempts them...

347
00:31:56,627 --> 00:32:00,085
<i>and they end up going in,
going in all the way.

00:32:38,569 --> 00:32:42,005
Sandy! You idiotic little dope!

349
00:32:42,106 --> 00:32:45,837
You could blow yourself fucking sky-high
with this demented crap!

350
00:32:51,815 --> 00:32:53,908
Hey.

351
00:32:55,018 --> 00:32:58,181
Hey.

352
00:32:59,757 --> 00:33:02,521
I'll take this.

353
00:33:02,626 --> 00:33:04,753
You're not gonna tell Dad, are you?

354
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:08,198
Would it matter?

355
00:33:08,298 --> 00:33:10,596
What's this?

356
00:33:10,701 --> 00:33:14,068
You know, it's the whip.

357
00:33:14,171 --> 00:33:17,732
The one Uncle Frank got me
from Mexico.

358
00:33:17,841 --> 00:33:21,038
It's not packed with explosives, is it?

359
00:33:22,446 --> 00:33:23,913
No.

360
00:33:25,582 --> 00:33:27,948
Play with the whip.

361
00:33:30,554 --> 00:33:33,387
You turned them all down,
didn't you?

362
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:35,253
Well, I didn't love them.

363
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:37,827
<i>And isn't it a fact
that you turned them down...

364
00:33:37,928 --> 00:33:40,123
<i>because these men wanted a home?

365
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:42,721
- Hi, Wendy.
- Hi, Mrs. Carver.

366
00:33:42,833 --> 00:33:46,098
Mikey, have you heard the explosions
coming from the backyard?

367
00:33:46,203 --> 00:33:48,171
<i>Sir, I want children very much.

368
00:33:48,272 --> 00:33:51,207
- I don't know.
- Do you know what your brother's been up to?

369
00:33:51,308 --> 00:33:54,300
<i>- Was because you thought...
- I don't know.

370
00:33:54,411 --> 00:33:57,778
<i>He had a secret intention
not to want children?

371
00:33:57,881 --> 00:34:00,816
<i>That's not true I want... No, sir.

372
00:34:00,918 --> 00:34:02,943
I want children very much,
and so does Bill.

373
00:34:11,462 --> 00:34:13,794
<i>In the past you would go to a gynecologist...

374
00:34:13,897 --> 00:34:16,161
<i>to find out why
you couldn't have children.

375
00:34:16,266 --> 00:34:17,927
<i>Yeah, I went to a doctor.

376
00:34:18,035 --> 00:34:20,435
<i>- What's the name of the doctor?
- Dr. Morris.

377
00:34:20,537 --> 00:34:24,633
Then when that happened, you went
to another doctor and got a prescription.

378
00:34:24,741 --> 00:34:26,709
- Isn't that true?
- No, sir, that is not true.

379
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:30,075
- Excuse me. Don't you kids have homework?
- Thanksgiving break.

380
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:34,276
Madam, if you deny that, we have
a witness in the courtroom, another druggist.

381
00:34:34,384 --> 00:34:36,682
Take a look for yourself.
You're under oath.

382
00:34:36,787 --> 00:34:39,449
All right! I did! Is it a crime?

383
00:34:39,556 --> 00:34:43,185
No wonder the police can't find out
how the gang is transporting the stuff.

384
00:34:43,293 --> 00:34:45,693
They're using milk trucks.

385
00:34:56,907 --> 00:35:00,104
<i>They're leaving.
Return the scanner and follow the truck.

386
00:35:03,547 --> 00:35:05,845
Oh. After you.

387
00:35:05,949 --> 00:35:07,849
Well, you can...

388
00:35:07,951 --> 00:35:11,409
Hey, Sandy, what were you blowing up out there?
Your mom seemed pretty P.O. 'd.

389
00:35:11,522 --> 00:35:14,082
- All my model planes.
- The ones you built?

390
00:35:14,191 --> 00:35:16,716
Yeah. They were getting old.

391
00:35:16,827 --> 00:35:19,387
They couldn't fly anyhow.

392
00:35:19,496 --> 00:35:22,158
I'm gonna get a radio-controlled airplane
for Christmas.

393
00:35:22,266 --> 00:35:27,363
I'm gonna stuff it full of M-80s and fly it
into Mrs. Burgess's class and blow it up.

394
00:35:28,639 --> 00:35:31,608
Well, I have to go to the bathroom.

395
00:35:40,384 --> 00:35:43,080
I'll show you mine
if you show me yours.

396
00:36:16,987 --> 00:36:20,252
<i>This place is loaded with electronic bugs.

397
00:36:20,357 --> 00:36:23,986
<i>- It can't be transmitted.
- No, that would tell them that we're here.

398
00:36:51,488 --> 00:36:55,151
What do you want?
What do you want?

399
00:36:55,258 --> 00:36:57,658
Get out of here!

400
00:36:57,761 --> 00:36:59,558
<i>Get out!

401
00:37:09,106 --> 00:37:11,734
Wendy.

402
00:37:11,842 --> 00:37:13,969
A person's body is his temple.

403
00:37:14,077 --> 00:37:17,171
<i>This body is your first
and last possession.

404
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,680
Now, as your own parents
have probably told you...

405
00:37:19,783 --> 00:37:22,411
in adolescence
our bodies tend to betray us...

406
00:37:22,519 --> 00:37:27,149
and that's why in Samoa
and other developing nations...

407
00:37:27,257 --> 00:37:29,657
adolescents are sent out
into the woods unarmed...

408
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,923
and they don't come back
till they've learned a thing or two.

409
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:34,827
Do you understand?

410
00:37:45,375 --> 00:37:48,105
I don't ever wanna see you.

411
00:37:48,211 --> 00:37:50,179
Then why'd you come after me?

412
00:38:04,594 --> 00:38:07,995
<i>Elena? Can you give me a hand here?

413
00:38:12,335 --> 00:38:14,462
Oh!

414
00:38:14,571 --> 00:38:18,007
I'm trying to get this turkey
defrosted before tomorrow.

415
00:38:18,108 --> 00:38:20,008
There. Got it?

416
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:22,010
Can you take this?

417
00:38:24,114 --> 00:38:26,207
Sorry.

418
00:38:33,757 --> 00:38:35,725
Here.

419
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:42,194
You all right there?

420
00:38:42,299 --> 00:38:44,199
Oh, sure. I'm...

421
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:53,468
Did you remember
to pick up the cranberry sauce?

422
00:38:53,577 --> 00:38:56,478
Yes. Yes.

423
00:38:56,580 --> 00:39:00,311
Because you like it
on your turkey sandwiches.

424
00:39:00,417 --> 00:39:02,851
I do.

425
00:39:02,953 --> 00:39:04,648
I'm...

426
00:39:04,755 --> 00:39:06,450
Are... Are you...

427
00:39:06,556 --> 00:39:09,047
I... I think I...

428
00:39:12,162 --> 00:39:14,221
- Elena, you know...
- Ben.

429
00:39:14,331 --> 00:39:17,232
- I've been thinking...
- Ben, maybe no talking right now.

430
00:39:17,334 --> 00:39:19,802
If you start talking,
you're going to...

431
00:39:38,922 --> 00:39:41,823
Going to pick up Paul at the station.
You wanna come?

432
00:39:41,925 --> 00:39:44,985
- No.
- What you been up to?

433
00:39:45,095 --> 00:39:47,063
Nothing.

434
00:40:11,021 --> 00:40:12,989
Your trip okay?

435
00:40:30,874 --> 00:40:33,172
So, how's school treating you?

436
00:40:33,276 --> 00:40:35,369
It's good.

437
00:40:35,478 --> 00:40:38,276
- Classes?
- Fine.

438
00:40:38,381 --> 00:40:40,872
- Grades?
- All right.

439
00:40:42,485 --> 00:40:45,045
Anyone special? You know...

440
00:40:48,758 --> 00:40:51,158
Well, it's good to see you.

441
00:40:51,261 --> 00:40:53,661
We miss you around the house and all.

442
00:40:53,763 --> 00:40:57,221
But this... this... this St. Peter's,
it's top of the line, eh?

443
00:40:57,334 --> 00:40:59,302
Oh, yeah.

444
00:41:01,304 --> 00:41:05,741
You know, Paul, I was thinking,
this may be as good a time as any to...

445
00:41:06,977 --> 00:41:08,945
have a little talk...

446
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:12,348
about...

447
00:41:14,117 --> 00:41:16,017
- Well...
- About...

448
00:41:18,121 --> 00:41:23,423
Well, the whole gamut.
The facts of life...

449
00:41:23,526 --> 00:41:28,725
'Cause I tell you, there's things happening
that you're probably old enough to digest.

450
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:31,392
"Things."

451
00:41:32,669 --> 00:41:35,001
Well...

452
00:41:35,105 --> 00:41:37,096
things that happen between a...

453
00:41:39,542 --> 00:41:41,772
<i>Well...

454
00:41:41,878 --> 00:41:45,006
on the self-abuse front...

455
00:41:45,115 --> 00:41:47,015
And this is important.

456
00:41:47,117 --> 00:41:50,018
I don't think it's advisable
to do it in the shower.

457
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:52,020
It wastes water and electricity...

458
00:41:52,122 --> 00:41:55,114
and because we all expect you
to be doing it there in any case.

459
00:41:55,225 --> 00:41:58,353
<i>And not on... onto the linen.

460
00:41:58,461 --> 00:42:00,429
<i>Well, anyway...

461
00:42:00,530 --> 00:42:04,523
if you're worried about anything at all,
just feel free to ask and...

462
00:42:04,634 --> 00:42:06,602
we'll look it up.

463
00:42:07,671 --> 00:42:10,139
Dad, you know I'm 16.

464
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:14,438
Well, all the more reason
to be having this little heart-to-heart.

465
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,784
<i>Hi

466
00:42:25,889 --> 00:42:28,915
Paul I was wondering...

467
00:42:29,025 --> 00:42:31,926
could you do me a favor
and pretend I never said any of that?

468
00:42:32,028 --> 00:42:34,155
- Sure, Dad.
- Thanks.

469
00:42:35,398 --> 00:42:37,298
- Hi!
- Hello.

470
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,368
How are you?

471
00:42:46,076 --> 00:42:47,976
Hello, Charles.

472
00:42:48,078 --> 00:42:50,046
Greetings, Charles.

473
00:42:54,684 --> 00:42:58,415
How are the parental units
functioning these days?

474
00:42:58,521 --> 00:43:03,254
<i>Dad's doing his Up with People routine.
Mom really hasn't been saying much.

475
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:06,818
I don't know.
Dad seems a little weird. You know? Nervous?

476
00:43:06,930 --> 00:43:10,331
Yeah, well, wait till Mom
finally opens her mouth.

477
00:43:12,435 --> 00:43:15,461
Do you think they're headed
for, like, the dustbin of history?

478
00:43:15,572 --> 00:43:17,540
Divorce court?

479
00:43:18,975 --> 00:43:21,944
Well, they dropped out of
their couples' group therapy thing.

480
00:43:22,045 --> 00:43:24,206
Is that good or bad?

481
00:43:28,585 --> 00:43:30,712
May I operate
the telephonic apparatus?

482
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:32,845
Why don't you use
the one downstairs?

483
00:43:32,956 --> 00:43:36,016
I'm calling an individual, Charles,
in New York...

484
00:43:36,126 --> 00:43:38,924
confirming a social outing
for Friday night.

485
00:43:39,029 --> 00:43:41,190
Can I come?

486
00:43:41,297 --> 00:43:44,494
It's a one-on-one kinda date thing.

487
00:43:44,601 --> 00:43:47,001
- With who?
- Her name's Libbets.

488
00:43:47,103 --> 00:43:49,401
Libbets?
What kind of a name is Libbets?

489
00:43:49,506 --> 00:43:52,566
Is that my record?

490
00:43:52,675 --> 00:43:54,575
Yeah, but...

491
00:43:54,677 --> 00:43:57,646
<i>You have messed with my shit, Charles.

492
00:44:36,986 --> 00:44:39,887
Well, it's great
that we can all be together.

493
00:44:39,989 --> 00:44:42,924
<i>And this Thanksgiving
no yelling, no hysteria...

494
00:44:43,026 --> 00:44:45,460
especially with your grandpa
not here...

495
00:44:45,562 --> 00:44:47,894
although we miss him.

496
00:44:47,997 --> 00:44:50,898
So let's do it right.
Wendy, why don't you say grace?

497
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,730
<i>You used to love to say grace.
Remember?

498
00:45:00,610 --> 00:45:04,102
Dear Lord, thank you
for this Thanksgiving holiday...

499
00:45:04,214 --> 00:45:07,980
<i>and for all the material possessions
that we have and enjoy...

500
00:45:08,084 --> 00:45:11,781
and for letting us white people
kill all the Indians and steal their tribal lands...

501
00:45:11,888 --> 00:45:14,288
- And stuff ourselves like pigs...
- Okay. Okay.

502
00:45:14,390 --> 00:45:16,324
Even though children in Asia
are being napalmed...

503
00:45:16,426 --> 00:45:18,394
Jesus! Enough! All right!

504
00:45:20,930 --> 00:45:23,922
- Paul, roll?
- Thank you.

505
00:45:24,033 --> 00:45:26,001
Can I have the gravy?

506
00:45:27,570 --> 00:45:29,538
Thank you.

507
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:39,480
Thanks.

508
00:45:39,582 --> 00:45:41,482
Are you having one?

509
00:45:41,584 --> 00:45:43,552
In a bit.

510
00:45:55,899 --> 00:45:58,868
You know, I think Elena
might suspect something.

511
00:46:04,274 --> 00:46:07,243
Maybe it's all for the better.
You know?

512
00:46:08,778 --> 00:46:11,178
Yesterday at dinner she...

513
00:46:11,281 --> 00:46:13,340
Well, she didn't say anything.

514
00:46:13,449 --> 00:46:15,212
Has she acted funny to you?

515
00:46:15,318 --> 00:46:18,219
I mean, have you noticed anything?

516
00:46:18,321 --> 00:46:20,949
<i>Have I noticed anything?

517
00:46:21,057 --> 00:46:22,957
I'm not married to her, Benjamin, you are.

518
00:46:23,059 --> 00:46:26,119
I think you've probably a better vantage point
from which to observe her.

519
00:46:27,864 --> 00:46:32,062
Yeah, but I've been
working a lot lately and...

520
00:46:32,168 --> 00:46:35,103
No, that's not it. I...

521
00:46:35,205 --> 00:46:39,869
I guess maybe we're just
on the verge of... saying something.

522
00:46:41,611 --> 00:46:44,136
Saying something to each other.

523
00:46:44,247 --> 00:46:46,215
On the verge.

524
00:46:48,318 --> 00:46:50,286
I'll be back.

525
00:46:52,488 --> 00:46:54,683
Birth control.

526
00:46:55,959 --> 00:46:57,927
Right. Gotcha.

527
00:47:24,787 --> 00:47:26,687
Janey?

528
00:48:51,941 --> 00:48:53,909
No one's here.

529
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:00,348
I mean, we could just watch TV.

530
00:49:01,851 --> 00:49:03,751
Maybe we can mess around.

531
00:49:03,853 --> 00:49:07,050
You know? Only if you want to.

532
00:49:09,292 --> 00:49:11,260
I don't know.

533
00:49:12,562 --> 00:49:15,053
Why did you, with Sandy?

534
00:49:15,164 --> 00:49:17,064
I don't know.

535
00:49:17,166 --> 00:49:19,134
Do you like him?

536
00:49:20,570 --> 00:49:22,470
He worships you.

537
00:49:22,572 --> 00:49:24,540
What's that?

538
00:49:25,575 --> 00:49:27,975
- Oh, wow!
- Wendy.

539
00:49:32,982 --> 00:49:34,882
I won't take my pants off.

540
00:49:34,984 --> 00:49:37,919
I'll touch it,
but that's as far as it goes.

541
00:50:40,249 --> 00:50:42,149
<i>- When Worlds Collide.

542

<i>4:30 movie.
When Worlds Collide.

543
00:50:45,221 --> 00:50:47,815
What the hell are you kids
doing down here?

544
00:50:47,924 --> 00:50:50,154
What do you think we're doing, Dad?

545
00:50:50,259 --> 00:50:52,921
What do I think?

546
00:50:53,029 --> 00:50:55,589
I think you're probably...
touching each other.

547
00:50:55,698 --> 00:50:59,395
I think you're touching
that reckless jerk-off, for God's sake...

548
00:50:59,502 --> 00:51:02,232
<i>and I think he's trying
to get into your slacks!

549
00:51:02,338 --> 00:51:05,171
I think at 14 years of age
you're getting ready to give up your girlhood.

550
00:51:05,274 --> 00:51:07,970
- Hey, hang on there, Mr. Hood.
- Don't you direct a single word at me, Mikey.

551
00:51:08,077 --> 00:51:09,977
I don't wanna hear it.

552
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:13,571
<i>I'll be discussing this matter
with your parents very soon.

00:51:15,551 --> 00:51:18,281
- Talking to me, Dad?
- Who else would I be talking to?

555
00:51:18,387 --> 00:51:20,355
And take that thing off!

556
00:51:22,091 --> 00:51:25,185
Then forget all the stern dad stuff.

557
00:51:26,295 --> 00:51:30,095
I'm not interested in your smart remarks
right now, young lady.

558
00:51:30,199 --> 00:51:33,828
<i>Let's go. Right now!
You and I can discuss it on the walk home.

Look, kiddo, don't worry about it.

560
00:51:59,228 --> 00:52:01,128
I really don't care that much.

561
00:52:01,230 --> 00:52:03,630
I'm just not sure
he's right for you, is all.

562
00:52:06,969 --> 00:52:09,403
It's just, you develop a sense...

563
00:52:09,505 --> 00:52:11,496
when you're older...

564
00:52:11,607 --> 00:52:15,043
if things are gonna work out
or if they won't.

565
00:52:15,144 --> 00:52:17,704
And sometimes it's...

566
00:52:17,813 --> 00:52:19,781
not worth the mess.

567
00:52:24,453 --> 00:52:26,011
Your toes cold?

568
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:32,828
Come on. I'll carry you.

569
00:53:02,058 --> 00:53:04,959
Hey, should I dress
for the Halfords now, or...

570
00:53:05,061 --> 00:53:06,961
- Give me your...
- It's up to you.

571
00:53:07,063 --> 00:53:09,964
I'd like to go early
and leave pretty soon after that.

572
00:53:10,066 --> 00:53:11,966
I get you loud and clear.

573
00:53:12,068 --> 00:53:14,298
- Hey, you look nice.
- Thanks.

574
00:53:14,403 --> 00:53:16,462
So, where have you two been?

575
00:53:16,572 --> 00:53:19,564
You'll never guess where I found her.

576
00:53:19,675 --> 00:53:21,905
You found her?

577
00:53:22,011 --> 00:53:24,912
In the basement at Janey and Jim's...

578
00:53:25,014 --> 00:53:27,209
with that weirdo Mikey.

579
00:53:27,316 --> 00:53:29,614
Not even a TV on.

580
00:53:29,719 --> 00:53:33,450
And they're on the floor,
and he's got his trousers undone...

581
00:53:33,556 --> 00:53:36,252
though, thank goodness,
she was still dressed.

582
00:53:36,359 --> 00:53:39,021
Well, I really let him have it.

583
00:53:39,128 --> 00:53:41,426
And Wendy came home peacefully.

584
00:53:41,530 --> 00:53:44,431
So, what were you doing
in the Carvers' basement anyway?

585
00:53:44,533 --> 00:53:48,094
I was just dropping off a coffee cup.
Jim left it last time he was over.

586
00:53:48,204 --> 00:53:51,105
It was on the dash of the car.
You were, you know, reading.

587
00:53:51,207 --> 00:53:54,301
- I just wanted to catch some air.
- Oh, right, right. The mustache coffee cup.

588
00:53:54,410 --> 00:53:57,504
- The one that was sitting on the dash.
- Yeah. That one.

589
00:53:57,613 --> 00:53:59,581
That one.

590
00:54:17,199 --> 00:54:19,633
- See ya!
- Stay out of trouble.

591
00:54:19,735 --> 00:54:22,966

- 11:30.

Well, what's on your mind?
I mean, you...

619
00:56:16,252 --> 00:56:18,914
It wouldn't make for a pleasant evening,
if that's what you're after.

620
00:56:19,021 --> 00:56:20,989
I don't want to talk about it.

621
00:56:21,090 --> 00:56:22,990
Stupid mustache cup.

622
00:56:24,026 --> 00:56:26,586
- What do you mean?
- Don't be dim.

623
00:56:28,898 --> 00:56:31,332
I know you think I'm so dense.
You think I'm so dense...

624
00:56:31,433 --> 00:56:34,664
that now you want to be seen with your
dense wife at the cocktail party.

625
00:56:34,770 --> 00:56:37,933
<i>And you want me to shake hands with
your friends and make conversation...

626
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:41,601
<i>and you're not going to accord me
the respect of talking honestly about this.

627
00:56:41,710 --> 00:56:44,577
You don't really know
what this feels like.

628
00:56:48,083 --> 00:56:49,175
I didn't...

629
00:56:51,921 --> 00:56:54,788
Technically,
it's not what you're thinking, Elena.

630
00:56:54,890 --> 00:56:58,656
Please have the decency to at least
not tell me what I'm thinking.

631
00:57:55,384 --> 00:57:57,875
Oh, Ben! Elena! Wonderful.

632
00:57:57,987 --> 00:58:00,148
- Wonderful. Come in.
- Thank you. Great to see ya.

633
00:58:00,256 --> 00:58:04,022
- I just got lipstick...
- That's all right.

634
00:58:04,126 --> 00:58:07,425
Good to see you too.

635
00:58:07,529 --> 00:58:09,019
Would you care to play?

636
00:58:09,131 --> 00:58:11,656
<i>New this year.

637
00:58:11,767 --> 00:58:14,327
It's strictly volunteer, of course.

638
00:58:16,972 --> 00:58:18,940
You can put your coats
in the library if you like.

639
00:58:20,676 --> 00:58:24,942
Oh, damn. I've left the...

640
00:58:25,047 --> 00:58:26,378
- Oh, you've...
- In the car.

641
00:58:26,482 --> 00:58:28,347
<i>- Oh.
- Yeah.

642
00:58:28,450 --> 00:58:30,247
Oh. Right.

643
00:58:30,352 --> 00:58:34,049
<i>We'll... We'll be right back.

644
00:58:34,156 --> 00:58:36,249
Okay.

645
00:58:36,358 --> 00:58:39,156
Oh, Rob. The stuffed tomatoes.

646
00:58:55,811 --> 00:58:57,938
This just isn't
the best moment for this.

647
00:58:59,048 --> 00:59:01,209
I know. I know.

648
00:59:02,251 --> 00:59:05,049
- I had no idea.
- That this was going to be a key party?

649
00:59:05,154 --> 00:59:11,024
Yeah. Well, if we'd understood
we could've invented some sort of excuse.

650
00:59:11,126 --> 00:59:13,560
A key party.

651
00:59:14,930 --> 00:59:17,660
Did you see how stuffed
that bowl was already?

652
00:59:21,203 --> 00:59:23,103
Well?

653
00:59:26,375 --> 00:59:29,640
I think we're here,
and we don't have to stay. We...

654
00:59:29,745 --> 00:59:34,011
ought simply to put in an appearance,
and then we can head home.

655
00:59:35,718 --> 00:59:37,743
You have some marker.

656
00:59:37,853 --> 00:59:39,878
That's what I think.

657
00:59:39,989 --> 00:59:42,617
If you wanna know the truth,
you have some marker.

658
00:59:44,727 --> 00:59:47,787
And you're gonna put it on
the house keys so that Janey can find it.

659
00:59:47,896 --> 00:59:50,592
Then when I get back to the house,
I'm gonna find the two of you in there...

660
00:59:50,699 --> 00:59:53,964
and Wendy will be able to hear you,
and Paul will be back and he'll hear you.

661
00:59:54,069 --> 00:59:56,230
- And I'll catch you. That's what I think.
- Elena.

662
00:59:57,272 --> 01:00:00,036
It's not what you think.
It's not some big plot.

663
01:00:04,513 --> 01:00:06,572
Honestly, I... I...

664
01:00:13,922 --> 01:00:16,083
I don't feel good about it.

665
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:20,494
<i>I just...

666
01:00:22,965 --> 01:00:25,365
I don't know.

667
01:00:27,636 --> 01:00:30,298
Well, I'm really pleased
to hear a confession.

668
01:00:30,406 --> 01:00:33,967
Elena, you're just getting
wound up to get wound up.

669
01:00:36,745 --> 01:00:39,145
Let's just go to this fiasco.

670
01:00:39,248 --> 01:00:42,342
If that's what you want.
Let's just go on in.

671
01:00:42,451 --> 01:00:44,976
I'd rather talk
to anyone else but you.

672
01:00:50,759 --> 01:00:54,786
My dear, he wrote her out of the will,
and now her attorneys are...

673
01:00:54,897 --> 01:00:57,889
<i>- This has been goin' on for years... Her attorneys...
- Oh, Dot.

674
01:01:19,988 --> 01:01:21,888
- Ben.
- Hey, Jack.

675
01:01:21,990 --> 01:01:23,890
- How you doin'? You're soaked.
- Good to see ya.

676
01:01:23,992 --> 01:01:26,586
- Well...
- Hell of a night out there. You know my wife, Ronnie.

677
01:01:26,695 --> 01:01:29,061
- Yeah, nice to see you. I'm just gonna go...
- Hey, Benjie.

678
01:01:29,164 --> 01:01:31,098
- Hey, Mark. How you doin'?
- Good to see you.

679
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:34,260
Great to see you.
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

680
01:01:34,369 --> 01:01:36,303
Excuse me.
Hey, Maude. How are you?

681
01:01:36,405 --> 01:01:38,839
- Well, well, well. Ben.
- Pierce, how you doin'?

682
01:01:38,941 --> 01:01:42,240
- Did I see Elena?
- She's here, yeah. Just gonna get a drink.

683
01:01:42,344 --> 01:01:44,744
- Excuse me.
- Benjie.

684
01:01:46,682 --> 01:01:50,413
Clair. George Clair. What the hell
brings you to New Canaan?

685
01:01:50,519 --> 01:01:53,079
Well, it's the funniest thing.

686
01:01:53,188 --> 01:01:55,088
I've been talking
to some investors...

687
01:01:55,190 --> 01:01:58,182
little outside venture,
you understand, between you and me...

688
01:01:58,293 --> 01:02:01,888
About a scheme to manufacture
a new Styrofoam packaging.

689
01:02:01,997 --> 01:02:04,727
These little...
these peanut-like pieces...

690
01:02:04,833 --> 01:02:07,427
really keep an item free
from trauma during shipping.

691
01:02:07,536 --> 01:02:10,266
It's miraculous.
Anyway, it turns out...

692
01:02:10,372 --> 01:02:13,466
that the genius behind the whole project
is your neighbor, Jim Carver.

693
01:02:13,575 --> 01:02:15,475
How about that?

694
01:02:16,512 --> 01:02:19,948
Well, isn't that
a one-in-a-million coincidence?

695
01:02:20,048 --> 01:02:22,915
<i>A real dreamer, our Jim Carver, eh?

696
01:02:23,018 --> 01:02:27,546
Darn right. Listen, I'm gonna make
a break for the hors d'oeuvres guy.

697
01:02:27,656 --> 01:02:30,284
Right. See you
bright and early Monday a.m.

698
01:02:30,392 --> 01:02:32,792
Say, where's the wife?

699
01:02:32,895 --> 01:02:36,831
In Rhode Island with her folks.
I'm a free agent tonight.

700
01:02:42,204 --> 01:02:44,104
How are you?

701
01:02:57,719 --> 01:03:00,779
Oh, geez, Benjie.
Well, here you are.

702
01:03:00,889 --> 01:03:03,858
Damn right.
Where the hell were you?

703
01:03:03,959 --> 01:03:07,087
What are you talking about?

704
01:03:07,196 --> 01:03:10,290
Don't bullshit me around, Janey.

705
01:03:10,399 --> 01:03:12,458
Jesus Christ.

706
01:03:12,568 --> 01:03:16,197
I waited around for more than half an hour
in nothing but my boxer shorts and...

707
01:03:16,305 --> 01:03:18,899
- Ben, Janey.
- Oh, hi, Dorothy, Ted.

708
01:03:19,007 --> 01:03:22,738
What's all that about?
I mean, what the hell happened?

709
01:03:22,844 --> 01:03:26,302
A prior engagement overcame me.

710
01:03:27,683 --> 01:03:29,742
- What?
- Listen, Benjamin Hood...

711
01:03:29,851 --> 01:03:33,446
I have obligations that precede your...

712
01:03:33,555 --> 01:03:35,455
from before you showed up.

713
01:03:35,557 --> 01:03:39,391
I mean, one or two good-natured
encounters... that doesn't mean I'm...

714
01:03:40,495 --> 01:03:42,895
I'm not just some toy for you.

715
01:03:44,032 --> 01:03:46,694
When I remembered some chores
I wanted to get done before the party...

716
01:03:46,802 --> 01:03:48,702
I just did them, that's all.

717
01:03:48,804 --> 01:03:51,364
'Cause I wanted to get them done
before I saw Jimmy.

718
01:03:52,474 --> 01:03:54,374
Jimmy?

719
01:03:54,476 --> 01:03:57,036
Jimmy?
I'm not sure how to take this.

720
01:03:57,145 --> 01:03:59,340
What do you mean, Jimmy?
I thought you and your husband...

721
01:03:59,448 --> 01:04:02,781
How you take it isn't all
that interesting to me, Benjamin.

722
01:04:03,885 --> 01:04:05,785
I'm sorry.

723
01:04:10,659 --> 01:04:13,253
I just can't believe
you could be so...

724
01:04:27,209 --> 01:04:30,701
<i>Now approaching
our final stop, Grand Central Station.

725
01:04:30,812 --> 01:04:33,474
<i>Grand Central Station.

726
01:04:37,219 --> 01:04:39,210
Excellent. We were waiting.

727
01:04:41,690 --> 01:04:44,250
We?

728
01:04:45,727 --> 01:04:49,686
<i>You ought to read this, Hood.
Nixon, our leader.

All ye need know about

730
01:04:52,067 --> 01:04:54,934
- Check out the Checkers speech stuff.
- Francis.

731
01:04:56,138 --> 01:04:58,698
You're gonna leave the seeds in there?
In the binding like that?

732
01:04:58,807 --> 01:05:02,607
- All will be revealed, baby.
- May look like just ordinary rain, but don't be deceived, Dan.

733
01:05:02,711 --> 01:05:04,645
When this falls to the ground,
it's turning immediately...

734
01:05:04,746 --> 01:05:06,646
to the hard, slick and slippery stuff...

735
01:05:06,748 --> 01:05:08,648
<i>Significant sleet and rain.

Hey there, you young knight.
Can you check on the mead?

738
01:05:14,256 --> 01:05:17,123
Can you sally forth and
secure us some more mead?

739
01:05:17,225 --> 01:05:21,685
Moisture. Moisture.

740
01:05:28,303 --> 01:05:30,203
Fuck.

741
01:05:30,305 --> 01:05:32,500
<i>Maybe put something on my jacket.

01:05:32,607 --> 01:05:34,507
<i>Yeah.

<i>Oh, man. Everything's gonna freeze,

Yeah. Paul, are you
gonna get home okay?

748
01:05:54,896 --> 01:05:57,296
<i>Yeah.

749
01:05:57,399 --> 01:06:00,698
<i>More or less took the form
of offering to assist the surgeon...

Reverend Edwards.

you sleep the sleep of the just.

And whence has yon
virginal maiden absconded?

765
01:08:01,890 --> 01:08:05,382
Oh, into one of the other 20 or so
bathrooms they got in this place.

766

Check it out.
Not for the faint of heart.

<i>No candy for me?

771
01:08:30,051 --> 01:08:33,214
Well I don't... I don't...

772
01:08:33,321 --> 01:08:35,789
- What is it?
- Come on, Paulie. Share the wealth.

773
01:08:35,891 --> 01:08:39,349
- I mean, you copped 'em from her mom's stash anyway.
- Let's see.

774
01:08:39,461 --> 01:08:43,795
Libbets, you really shouldn't mix
and match. You know, with the beer.

775
01:08:43,899 --> 01:08:45,491
I'm gonna put 'em back.

776
01:08:46,968 --> 01:08:51,769
Oh, far out, Paulie. Hey, look,
these expired, like, five months ago.

777
01:08:51,873 --> 01:08:54,239
Think they're better aged?

778
01:08:54,342 --> 01:08:57,539
Maybe you should just have a half.

779
01:08:57,646 --> 01:09:00,046
Thanks for the advice, dad.

780
01:09:00,148 --> 01:09:02,116
<i>All right.

781
01:09:17,899 --> 01:09:20,026
- Benjie.
- Hey.

782
01:09:20,135 --> 01:09:22,126
Feelin' no pain.

783
01:09:23,805 --> 01:09:27,036
The Indian saying goes,
"Pain is merely an opinion."

784
01:09:30,078 --> 01:09:33,775
Hey, check it out.
Maria Conrad brought her son.

785
01:09:37,452 --> 01:09:41,320
I wish some of the gang
had brought their daughters.

786
01:09:50,732 --> 01:09:54,429
Thank you, Brian.

787
01:10:01,376 --> 01:10:04,868
- Hood residence.
- Your parents at that party?

788
01:10:04,980 --> 01:10:07,380
Yeah. Yours?

789
01:10:07,482 --> 01:10:10,883
You get in trouble?

790
01:10:10,986 --> 01:10:13,454
I don't know.
I can't really tell yet.

791
01:10:13,555 --> 01:10:16,547
Sorry if I got you into trouble.

792
01:10:16,658 --> 01:10:18,125
Yeah.

793
01:10:18,226 --> 01:10:20,786
- People start pollution.
- I'm gonna check out the ice storm.

794
01:10:20,895 --> 01:10:23,955
- People can stop it.
- Wanna come?

795
01:10:24,065 --> 01:10:26,932
<i>Maybe. I don't know.

796
01:11:05,373 --> 01:11:07,841
Where are you going?

797
01:11:07,942 --> 01:11:11,207
- Out.
- It's freezing.

798
01:11:11,312 --> 01:11:13,041
Yeah.

799
01:11:13,148 --> 01:11:15,343
Then why are you going?

800
01:11:15,450 --> 01:11:19,284
When it freezes, I guess that means
the molecules are not moving.

801
01:11:19,387 --> 01:11:21,446
So when you breathe,
there's nothing in the air...

802
01:11:21,556 --> 01:11:23,456
you know, to breathe into your body.

803
01:11:23,558 --> 01:11:26,391
The molecules have stopped.

804
01:11:26,494 --> 01:11:28,985
It's clean.

805
01:11:46,681 --> 01:11:51,641
When you're asking yourself
this question, "What is 'is'?" and...

806
01:11:51,753 --> 01:11:55,712
Oh, wait. This is the... the... the training
where they don't let you go to the bathroom.

807
01:11:55,824 --> 01:11:58,088
That was the hard part, but I did it.

808
01:11:58,193 --> 01:12:01,060
The foot.

809
01:12:01,162 --> 01:12:03,630
<i>The foot.

810
01:12:03,732 --> 01:12:06,064
Toe clipper man.

811
01:12:13,808 --> 01:12:18,745
I guess he's just really exhausted
from, you know, tests and stuff.

812
01:12:22,650 --> 01:12:24,618
Yeah.

813
01:12:27,822 --> 01:12:31,087
You know, Libbets...

814
01:12:31,192 --> 01:12:33,160
I really feel...

815
01:12:34,529 --> 01:12:37,123
you know, like,
a real connection to you.

816
01:12:37,232 --> 01:12:39,166
Yeah.

817
01:12:39,267 --> 01:12:42,134
- You don't even know me really.
- Sure I do.

818
01:12:42,237 --> 01:12:46,230
Like, your aura that you give off.

819
01:12:47,642 --> 01:12:49,610
My what?

820
01:12:51,679 --> 01:12:54,477
It's, like, very positive.

821
01:12:54,582 --> 01:12:56,550
And...

822
01:12:58,052 --> 01:13:00,816
I feel a real...

823
01:13:00,922 --> 01:13:03,618
special feeling for you.

824
01:13:03,725 --> 01:13:07,593
I have a special feeling
for you too...

825
01:13:09,130 --> 01:13:11,098
'cause I... I do...

826
01:13:11,199 --> 01:13:13,667
Special.

827
01:13:14,769 --> 01:13:18,170
- You do?
- Yeah.

828
01:13:18,273 --> 01:13:21,504
To me, you're just like a...

829
01:13:23,645 --> 01:13:27,137
I feel for you
like you're my o-own...

830
01:13:29,417 --> 01:13:31,317
You're just like a...

831
01:13:34,355 --> 01:13:36,687
- Brother.
- Brother.

832
01:13:39,594 --> 01:13:43,587
- Yeah, you're not alone with that line.
- I do.

833
01:13:45,266 --> 01:13:47,234
You are.

834
01:13:48,269 --> 01:13:50,760
Right. That's cool.

835
01:13:54,375 --> 01:13:57,902
So, how about we take
a bath together?

836
01:14:06,754 --> 01:14:08,722
You're funny.

837
01:14:08,823 --> 01:14:11,314
A bath.

838
01:14:11,426 --> 01:14:14,224
Like... Like a brother and sister.

839
01:14:22,804 --> 01:14:24,772
Oh, man.

840
01:14:27,876 --> 01:14:30,401
<i>I'm so wasted.

841
01:15:25,767 --> 01:15:27,735
Hello?

842
01:15:54,395 --> 01:15:56,295
Wendy?

843
01:15:56,397 --> 01:15:58,831
Sandy, you scared the shit out of me.

844
01:16:00,201 --> 01:16:02,362
What are you doing?

845
01:16:02,470 --> 01:16:05,064
I just thought I'd stop by.

846
01:16:05,173 --> 01:16:06,936
Mike's out.

847
01:16:08,042 --> 01:16:10,135
<i>I think he went to Silver Meadow...

848
01:16:10,244 --> 01:16:12,303
to see if you were
hanging around there.

849
01:16:13,414 --> 01:16:15,314
Yeah.

850
01:16:20,755 --> 01:16:23,451
Good night.

851
01:16:23,558 --> 01:16:26,356
Okay, everyone. We have
a little business to attend to now.

852
01:16:26,461 --> 01:16:32,263
So, everyone who'd like to stay,
please gather in the living room.

853
01:16:32,367 --> 01:16:34,733
Knock, knock.

854
01:16:37,939 --> 01:16:40,999
All right. Everybody, I've got the bowl.

855
01:16:41,109 --> 01:16:43,577
<i>We're gonna start now,
so nobody go anywhere.

856
01:16:43,678 --> 01:16:46,238
<i>I'm talking to you, Fred.

857
01:16:47,949 --> 01:16:50,941
<i>- Oh, my... Oh!.
- No, no.

858
01:16:58,626 --> 01:17:00,560
You ready to go?

859
01:17:02,764 --> 01:17:05,198
We're not going anywhere.

860
01:17:08,269 --> 01:17:10,066
<i>Don't go anywhere.

861
01:17:14,108 --> 01:17:17,009
<i>Mark? Mark, where'd you go?

862
01:18:08,563 --> 01:18:11,930
Check this out. He's supposed
to say all sorts of stuff...

863
01:18:12,033 --> 01:18:14,194
but he's kind of malfunctioned.

864
01:18:15,570 --> 01:18:18,403
Mayday! Mayday!
Get this message back to base!

865
01:18:18,506 --> 01:18:22,101
Same thing, again and again.

866
01:18:23,211 --> 01:18:25,577
<i>It's gonna get a lot
colder tonight, I predict.

867
01:18:25,680 --> 01:18:27,705
Maybe even a blackout.

868
01:18:27,815 --> 01:18:30,716
<i>Mayday! Mayday!
Get this message back to basel.

869
01:18:30,818 --> 01:18:32,752
<i>Do you have candles in your house?

870
01:18:33,855 --> 01:18:36,483
<i>I know where the candles are.

871
01:18:36,591 --> 01:18:39,492
And I know where every
emergency exit is on this floor.

872
01:18:45,399 --> 01:18:47,890
This knot's called
a hangman's noose.

873
01:18:49,971 --> 01:18:51,939
Let's hang him.

874
01:19:05,720 --> 01:19:07,950
He's dead.

875
01:19:08,055 --> 01:19:11,582
If it wasn't raining, we could
take him outside and blow him up.

876
01:19:11,692 --> 01:19:15,992
He wouldn't blow up.
He'd just get all mangled or twisted.

877
01:19:30,578 --> 01:19:34,947
Well, looks like someone
got to its private parts before us.

878
01:19:35,049 --> 01:19:37,313
Communist Vietcong.

879
01:19:38,419 --> 01:19:40,683
<i>He left it in the jungle.

880
01:19:47,328 --> 01:19:51,458
Can I get in your bed...
with you?

881
01:20:11,018 --> 01:20:13,646
Well?

882
01:20:14,922 --> 01:20:18,756
<i>What shall the order be?

883
01:20:23,464 --> 01:20:26,922
Alphabetical?
In order of appearance?

884
01:20:28,035 --> 01:20:31,334
Golf handicap.

885
01:20:32,440 --> 01:20:34,499
<i>Lowest handicap does the honors.

886
01:20:34,609 --> 01:20:38,238
<i>That'd be Benjie.

887
01:20:38,346 --> 01:20:40,576
<i>Ladies, isn't this really up to you?

888
01:20:42,683 --> 01:20:45,049
<i>It's up to one of us.

889
01:20:48,356 --> 01:20:50,551
Oh, hell, I'll go first.

890
01:20:50,658 --> 01:20:53,286
All right, all right.

891
01:20:53,394 --> 01:20:56,056
<i>That's it.

892
01:20:58,666 --> 01:21:01,066
<i>And the winner is?

893
01:21:05,806 --> 01:21:07,831
<i>Have fun. Have fun.

894
01:21:09,844 --> 01:21:11,903
<i>- Go get her, killer.
- This is great.

895
01:21:12,013 --> 01:21:13,480
Good night.

896
01:21:15,082 --> 01:21:17,141
<i>Good luck.

897
01:21:17,251 --> 01:21:20,243
<i>- Okay, here goes.
- Drive carefully.

898
01:21:20,354 --> 01:21:22,754
Okay, Pammy.

899
01:21:45,446 --> 01:21:47,914
Want a drink?

900
01:21:48,015 --> 01:21:51,075
- Vodka?
- You never tasted the stuff?

901
01:22:06,801 --> 01:22:08,701
Try again.

902
01:22:11,739 --> 01:22:14,207
Feels warm.

903
01:22:14,308 --> 01:22:17,436
One more shot?

904
01:22:30,124 --> 01:22:32,524
Under the covers?

905
01:22:50,077 --> 01:22:52,705
<i>Get 'em off.

906
01:23:19,273 --> 01:23:22,436
Have you ever had
a nocturnal emission?

907
01:23:24,645 --> 01:23:27,375
It's when you wake up
and you find this pool of sticky stuff...

908
01:23:27,481 --> 01:23:30,041
like after a sexy dream.

909
01:23:33,788 --> 01:23:36,552
They haven't told you
about this stuff yet?

910
01:23:36,657 --> 01:23:40,286
On what planet are you living on?

911
01:23:47,368 --> 01:23:49,359
I love you.

912
01:23:51,572 --> 01:23:53,506
That's nice.

913
01:23:53,607 --> 01:23:55,541
Are you drunk?

914
01:23:56,844 --> 01:23:59,369
I don't know.

915
01:23:59,480 --> 01:24:01,448
How do I know?

916
01:24:01,549 --> 01:24:04,245
I don't know either.

917
01:24:04,351 --> 01:24:07,684
You spin around
when you lie down, I think.

918

I don't think I'm spinning.

- Try again.
- No.

926

- No, no, that's...
- No, thanks.

927

<i>He's okay.

934
01:27:28,188 --> 01:27:31,624
He'll be okay. Come on.

935
01:27:31,725 --> 01:27:33,625
<i>You okay?

936
01:27:33,727 --> 01:27:35,695
<i>Ben?

937
01:27:38,432 --> 01:27:40,423
Sorry.

938
01:27:41,535 --> 01:27:43,662
Sorry.

939
01:27:43,771 --> 01:27:47,434
I... Maybe, the bathroom?

940
01:27:47,541 --> 01:27:49,441
<i>- Yeah, yeah.
- It's right down the hall.

941
01:27:49,543 --> 01:27:51,511
<i>Up we go.

942
01:27:51,612 --> 01:27:53,580
Hang on.

943
01:28:12,099 --> 01:28:14,067
Hold the train!

944
01:28:16,670 --> 01:28:18,638
Hold it!

945
01:28:37,925 --> 01:28:39,893
Watch your step.

946
01:28:46,834 --> 01:28:49,632
Well, I have to say I don't have
much faith that my car keys...

947
01:28:49,737 --> 01:28:51,705
are still in that bowl.

948
01:28:54,274 --> 01:28:58,404
It doesn't seem very safe
leaving your car keys laying around.

949
01:29:03,050 --> 01:29:04,950
Let me.

950
01:29:17,498 --> 01:29:19,466
Thanks, but...

951
01:29:21,135 --> 01:29:23,103
Oh, I don't think so.

952
01:29:24,872 --> 01:29:26,840
It's been kind of
a discouraging evening.

953
01:29:28,375 --> 01:29:31,902
Well, you couldn't have hoped for
much better when you came up the walk.

954
01:29:33,981 --> 01:29:37,280
Somehow it seemed different in
my imagination when I thought about it.

955
01:29:39,353 --> 01:29:41,412
Actually, I didn't
think about it at all really.

956
01:29:43,757 --> 01:29:45,952
You want some coffee or something?

957
01:29:54,034 --> 01:29:56,002
Elena...

958
01:29:57,271 --> 01:29:59,239
the fact that we're neighbors...

959
01:30:00,340 --> 01:30:02,308
close friends...

960
01:30:03,377 --> 01:30:05,777
well, it makes all this
seem a little strange...

961
01:30:05,879 --> 01:30:07,847
don't you think?

962
01:30:09,850 --> 01:30:14,947
My husband is probably
passed out in the bathroom.

963
01:30:15,055 --> 01:30:17,023
Or at least he wishes he were.

964
01:30:18,559 --> 01:30:23,223
I've been married to him for 17 years, and
I have no intention of going in there to get him.

965
01:30:25,532 --> 01:30:28,365
So, what I'm proposing is that...

966
01:30:28,468 --> 01:30:31,266
since your wife went off with a boy
and since you are here alone...

967
01:30:31,371 --> 01:30:33,464
I'm proposing that you and I
do what makes sense.

968
01:30:33,574 --> 01:30:36,042
Stay warm, pass some time.
That's all.

969
01:30:38,545 --> 01:30:40,740
Now don't make me feel
as if I'm being too forward.

970
01:30:40,848 --> 01:30:43,078
- If you don't...
- What the hey. Let's go for a drive.

971
01:30:44,117 --> 01:30:46,051
Okay.

972
01:30:51,425 --> 01:30:53,450
Oh, Jim! Hold on to me. Hold on.

973
01:31:00,100 --> 01:31:03,228
Maybe we shouldn't be driving.

974
01:31:03,337 --> 01:31:06,670
We're gonna go for a drive.
I think we should go for a drive.

975
01:31:17,651 --> 01:31:19,619
Thanks.

976
01:31:26,126 --> 01:31:28,788
We're gonna have to defrost this thing for a while.

977
01:31:57,858 --> 01:32:00,383
Do these seats go back?

978
01:32:39,433 --> 01:32:42,925
Oh!

979
01:32:45,238 --> 01:32:47,536
Oh, God.

980
01:32:50,844 --> 01:32:52,812
That was awful.

981
01:32:54,181 --> 01:32:56,479
Really awful.
I'm so sorry, Elena.

982
01:33:13,967 --> 01:33:15,935
Look.

983
01:33:16,036 --> 01:33:17,970
Can you wait here a sec?

984
01:33:19,806 --> 01:33:22,036
<i>I... I need to tidy up.

985
01:33:22,142 --> 01:33:26,841
Just a minute. I'll...
I'll be right back. Will you wait?

986
01:33:26,947 --> 01:33:28,938
Of course.

987
01:33:58,578 --> 01:34:00,546
Elena.

988
01:34:12,025 --> 01:34:13,993
Ben, I've got a ride home.

989
01:34:16,196 --> 01:34:19,290
Maybe you should sleep this one off
on the couch here.

990
01:34:20,367 --> 01:34:23,859
- I'll drive you.
- No. No, Ben. No.

991
01:34:23,970 --> 01:34:25,938
You're in no condition to drive.

992
01:34:28,108 --> 01:34:30,076
We'll talk in the morning, okay?

993
01:34:31,178 --> 01:34:33,578
You get some sleep
on the couch out there?

994
01:34:35,649 --> 01:34:38,345
I'll try.

995
01:34:38,452 --> 01:34:40,420
We'll talk in the morning.

996
01:34:41,855 --> 01:34:43,823
We'll talk in the morning.

997
01:35:16,022 --> 01:35:18,456
Shit!

998
01:35:20,494 --> 01:35:23,657
<i>- Jim, stop it. Stop it!.
- Easy does it. Easy.

999
01:35:30,036 --> 01:35:32,266
Are you okay?

1000
01:35:33,406 --> 01:35:35,340
Yeah, yeah. I'm all right.

1001
01:38:44,030 --> 01:38:45,759
Oh, no.

1002
01:39:49,362 --> 01:39:51,262
<i>When you think about it...

1003
01:39:51,364 --> 01:39:55,926
<i>It's not easy to keep from
just wandering out of life.

1004
01:39:56,035 --> 01:40:00,199
<i>It's like someone's always leaving
the door open to the next world...

1005
01:40:00,306 --> 01:40:03,742
<i>and if you aren't paying attention,
you could just walk through it...

1006
01:40:03,843 --> 01:40:06,505
<i>and then you've died.

1007
01:40:06,613 --> 01:40:10,413
<i>That's why in your dreams it's like
you're standing in that doorway...

1008
01:40:10,517 --> 01:40:14,112
<i>and the dying people
and the newborn people pass by you...

1009
01:40:14,220 --> 01:40:18,156
<i>and brush up against you as they come in
and out of the world during the night.

1010
01:40:19,192 --> 01:40:21,956
<i>You get spun around,
and in the morning...

1011
01:40:22,061 --> 01:40:25,155
<i>it takes a while to find
your way back into the world.

1012
01:40:28,368 --> 01:40:30,336
Yeah.

1013
01:40:37,477 --> 01:40:39,445
Phone's out.

1014
01:40:42,048 --> 01:40:44,016
Hope the pipes...

1015
01:40:46,986 --> 01:40:49,477
Oh, wow.

1016
01:40:50,523 --> 01:40:53,321
Why don't you put on some dry socks.

1017
01:40:53,426 --> 01:40:59,228
And there are some rain boots
in the guest closet back there.

1018
01:40:59,332 --> 01:41:01,630
- Last room downstairs.
- Thanks.

1019
01:41:20,119 --> 01:41:22,519
Get dressed.

1020
01:43:44,197 --> 01:43:46,961
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

1021
01:43:47,066 --> 01:43:52,299
This train, originating from New York's
Grand Central Station, is back in service.

1022
01:43:52,405 --> 01:43:55,135
Next stop will be
New Canaan, Connecticut.

1023
01:43:55,241 --> 01:43:57,675
New Canaan, Connecticut, next stop.

1024
01:44:28,741 --> 01:44:31,437
<i>Jim! Janey!

1025
01:44:40,787 --> 01:44:42,755
<i>Ben.

1026
01:44:54,901 --> 01:44:57,802
<i>Jim, he was just...

1027
01:44:58,905 --> 01:45:01,169
<i>up in Silver Lane.

1028
01:45:02,241 --> 01:45:04,209
<i>I think a power line...

1029
01:45:55,595 --> 01:45:57,563
Mikey.

1030
01:46:22,054 --> 01:46:24,022
<i>Oh, Mikey.

1031
01:48:48,100 --> 01:48:50,068
Ben.

1032
01:48:52,171 --> 01:48:54,571
Ben.
