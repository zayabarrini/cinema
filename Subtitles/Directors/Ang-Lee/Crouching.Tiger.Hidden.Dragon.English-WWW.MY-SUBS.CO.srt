1
00:01:05,316 --> 00:01:07,068
Master Li is here!

2
00:01:07,443 --> 00:01:10,196
<i>- Master Li is here!
- Master Li is here!</i>

3
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:26,170
Xiulian!

4
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,467
Xiulian! Li Mubai is here!

5
00:01:37,015 --> 00:01:38,766
- Master Li.
- Hello.

6
00:01:39,183 --> 00:01:42,061
- How's everything?
- Fine. Please come in.

7
00:01:53,531 --> 00:01:56,618
- Mubai. It's been a long time.
- It has.

8
00:01:57,577 --> 00:02:00,580
- How's business?
- Not bad. And how are you?

9
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:02,206
Fine.

10
00:02:06,502 --> 00:02:09,047
Monk Zheng came by
from the Wudang Mountain.

11
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:11,758
He said you were practicing
deep meditation.

12
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:17,597
The mountain must be so peaceful.
I envy you.

13
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,850
My work keeps me so busy
I hardly get a minute's rest.

14
00:02:23,019 --> 00:02:25,938
I broke it off.
I couldn't complete the training.

15
00:02:27,231 --> 00:02:30,735
Why? You're a Wudang disciple.
Training is everything.

16
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:37,575
During my meditation training,
I came to a place of deep silence.

17
00:02:38,618 --> 00:02:40,745
I was surrounded by light.

18
00:02:41,454 --> 00:02:44,415
Time and space disappeared.

19
00:02:45,792 --> 00:02:49,879
I felt I had come to a place
my master had never told me about.

20
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:55,510
- You were enlightened.
- Far from it.

21
00:02:56,052 --> 00:02:59,472
I didn't feel the bliss
of enlightenment.

22
00:02:59,555 --> 00:03:03,935
Instead, I was surrounded
by an endless sorrow.

23
00:03:05,395 --> 00:03:08,106
It was more than I could take.

24
00:03:08,898 --> 00:03:12,026
I couldn't go on. I failed.

25
00:03:13,361 --> 00:03:16,823
There was something pulling me
back into the world.

26
00:03:18,449 --> 00:03:19,909
What was it?

27
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:25,331
Something I can't seem to let go of.

28
00:03:29,377 --> 00:03:31,546
I see you're preparing to leave.

29
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:36,092
We're making a delivery to Beijing.

30
00:03:36,801 --> 00:03:40,805
Perhaps I could ask you
to deliver something to Bei-leye for me.

31
00:03:46,144 --> 00:03:49,272
The Green Destiny Sword?
You're giving it to Bei-leye?

32
00:03:49,355 --> 00:03:52,900
I am. He has always been
our greatest protector.

33
00:03:52,984 --> 00:03:55,945
I don't understand.
How can you part with it?

34
00:03:56,028 --> 00:03:58,406
It's been with you a long time.

35
00:03:59,574 --> 00:04:02,160
Too many men have died at its edge.

36
00:04:06,581 --> 00:04:08,374
It only looks pure

37
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:11,252
because blood
washes so easily from its blade.

38
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:15,214
You use it for just causes,
making you worthy of it.

39
00:04:17,717 --> 00:04:20,011
It's time for me to leave it behind.

40
00:04:21,053 --> 00:04:23,514
So what will you do then?

41
00:04:26,601 --> 00:04:28,603
Come with me to Beijing.

42
00:04:28,978 --> 00:04:31,939
You can give the sword to Bei-leye in person.

43
00:04:32,064 --> 00:04:34,692
It'll be just like old times.

44
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:39,739
I need to visit my master's grave.

45
00:04:40,573 --> 00:04:44,243
It's been many years since
he was murdered by Jade Fox.

46
00:04:44,327 --> 00:04:49,081
I have yet to avenge his death,
and yet I'm thinking of quitting.

47
00:04:49,707 --> 00:04:52,126
I must pray for his forgiveness.

48
00:04:52,794 --> 00:04:57,089
Catch up with me when you have finished.

49
00:04:57,423 --> 00:04:59,759
I can wait for you in Beijing.

50
00:05:00,885 --> 00:05:02,178
Perhaps.

51
00:05:09,811 --> 00:05:12,438
- Okay, you may pass.
- Thanks.

52
00:05:12,522 --> 00:05:14,398
Let's go into the city. We can rest
after we unload the shipment.

53
00:05:25,618 --> 00:05:28,246
Thank God everything is safe.
Much obliged, Miss Yu.

54
00:05:28,329 --> 00:05:31,624
Just doing my job.

55
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:35,628
Sun Security has been the best
since your father started it.

56
00:05:36,337 --> 00:05:40,591
You're a credit to his memory.

57
00:05:40,842 --> 00:05:44,095
- Thank you.
- It's the truth.

58
00:06:19,547 --> 00:06:22,258
This is Li's personal sword.

59
00:06:23,301 --> 00:06:26,929
A great hero is worthy of a great weapon.

60
00:06:27,263 --> 00:06:31,642
He is the only one in the world
worthy of it.

61
00:06:32,143 --> 00:06:35,062
It's too fine a gift. I cannot accept it.

62
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:39,150
The sword has brought Li Mubai
as much woe as glory.

63
00:06:39,483 --> 00:06:42,111
Li wants to leave these troubles behind.

64
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:45,364
Taking the sword will help him
leave his old way of life.

65
00:06:45,907 --> 00:06:48,951
I see. All right.
I'll act as the sword's custodian.

66
00:06:52,038 --> 00:06:54,040
Ninth Level Counsel, Governor Yu has arrived.

67
00:06:54,123 --> 00:06:55,708
I'll be right there.

68
00:06:56,334 --> 00:07:01,297
Thank you. You've always been
a great friend to Li and I.

69
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,966
No hurry to leave. Please feel at home.

70
00:07:04,383 --> 00:07:06,928
You'll stay the night as my guest.

71
00:07:07,845 --> 00:07:10,222
Now, Xiulian,

72
00:07:10,306 --> 00:07:14,226
tell me something,
and forgive me for prying.

73
00:07:14,977 --> 00:07:17,772
But your father was like a brother to me

74
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:21,025
and I think of you as my own daughter.

75
00:07:21,275 --> 00:07:23,486
Please, Bei-leye, what is it?

76
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:28,783
Li Mubai giving up his sword
and his warrior days,

77
00:07:29,575 --> 00:07:32,370
maybe he's hinting something to you.

78
00:07:33,245 --> 00:07:35,873
- I don't know.
- Don't be coy.

79
00:07:36,207 --> 00:07:39,085
I've known all along about
your feelings for each other.

80
00:07:39,168 --> 00:07:41,587
Neither of you have been brave enough

81
00:07:41,671 --> 00:07:45,341
to reveal your feelings to each other.

82
00:07:46,968 --> 00:07:49,679
So many years went wasted.

83
00:07:50,763 --> 00:07:52,890
Li Mubai and I aren't cowards.

84
00:07:52,974 --> 00:07:55,434
Maybe it isn't what you've thought.

85
00:07:57,436 --> 00:08:03,234
When it comes to emotions,
even great heroes can be idiots.

86
00:08:04,443 --> 00:08:08,614
If Li Mubai doesn't talk straight
next time you see him,

87
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:12,576
let me know, and <i>I'll</i> give him an earful

88
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:23,379
You will stay in this room.

89
00:08:29,343 --> 00:08:30,386
Miss?

90
00:08:35,725 --> 00:08:39,145
I am your guest here today.
I'm Governor Yu's daughter.

91
00:08:41,063 --> 00:08:43,983
This is Bei-leye's study. You are here to...

92
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:48,279
It's so crowded out there.
I was looking for a quiet place.

93
00:08:49,071 --> 00:08:53,242
I'm Bei-leye's head servant, De Lu.
This is another of our guests.

94
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:08,883
It's heavy for such a thin piece of metal.

95
00:09:09,133 --> 00:09:12,887
It's all in the hilt.
And that blade is no ordinary metal.

96
00:09:13,054 --> 00:09:16,307
Still, the sword is the lightest
of all weapons.

97
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:19,226
You're just not used to handling them.

98
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:21,729
But I have had much practice.

99
00:09:21,812 --> 00:09:24,065
As a child in the west, a garrison lived with us.

100
00:09:24,148 --> 00:09:26,400
They'd let me play with their weapons.

101
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:29,945
This scabbard is so beautiful.

102
00:09:31,447 --> 00:09:33,324
Beautiful and yet dangerous.

103
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:37,161
Once you've seen it tainted with blood,
its beauty is hard to admire.

104
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,623
It's 400 years old.

105
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:42,917
It's exquisite.

106
00:09:43,876 --> 00:09:46,378
You said this sword belongs to...

107
00:09:46,629 --> 00:09:48,964
My friend Li Mubai.

108
00:09:49,507 --> 00:09:51,425
He's given it to Bei-leye as a gift.

109
00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:54,011
Li Mubai! The famous warrior?

110
00:09:54,095 --> 00:09:58,224
I've heard so much about him.
Why would he give his sword to Bei-leye?

111
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:01,060
You're too young to understand.

112
00:10:02,895 --> 00:10:07,149
- You must be a sword fighter, too.
- Yes, but I prefer the broadsword.

113
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:11,320
Certain moves, however, call for a straight blade.

114
00:10:13,197 --> 00:10:14,573
Really.

115
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,745
It must be exciting to be a fighter, 
to be totally free!

116
00:10:20,162 --> 00:10:23,749
Even Jianghu society has rules.
Friendship, trust, integrity.

117
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:25,960
Always keep your promise.

118
00:10:26,085 --> 00:10:28,838
Without rules, we wouldn't survive long.

119
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,966
I've read all about people like you.

120
00:10:32,049 --> 00:10:34,969
Roaming wild,
beating up anyone who gets in your way!

121
00:10:35,052 --> 00:10:38,013
Writers have to write like that
to sell books.

122
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:40,933
You're just like the characters
in the stories.

123
00:10:41,058 --> 00:10:44,895
Sure, no place to bathe for days,
sleeping on flea-infested beds.

124
00:10:45,563 --> 00:10:47,773
Do they tell you all about that in those books?

125
00:10:47,857 --> 00:10:49,775
You know what I mean.

126
00:10:50,192 --> 00:10:54,196
I'm getting married soon,
but I haven't lived the life I want.

127
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:58,576
I've heard of your engagement.
Congratulations.

128
00:11:02,246 --> 00:11:06,000
It's the most important step
in a woman's life, isn't it?

129
00:11:07,585 --> 00:11:11,005
- You are not married, are you?
- What do you think?

130
00:11:11,422 --> 00:11:14,717
No. You couldn't roam around
freely if you were.

131
00:11:15,301 --> 00:11:17,678
I admit you're probably right.

132
00:11:50,044 --> 00:11:51,879
Go ahead, Governor.

133
00:12:03,349 --> 00:12:08,020
2 feet 9 inches long, 1.1 inch wide.

134
00:12:08,187 --> 00:12:11,482
The hilt is 8 inches long, 2.6 inches wide,

135
00:12:11,815 --> 00:12:15,569
0.7 inch thick, each side is 1.5 inches.

136
00:12:15,653 --> 00:12:18,197
With seven rubies missing from the hilt.

137
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:22,910
You can tell from the design that
it was made during the Qin Wu era.

138
00:12:22,993 --> 00:12:26,121
Engraved with a technique lost by
the time of the Han Dynasty.

139
00:12:26,205 --> 00:12:29,333
Your knowledge is remarkable.

140
00:12:31,043 --> 00:12:33,254
A sword by itself rules nothing.

141
00:12:33,462 --> 00:12:36,465
It comes alive only through
skilful manipulation.

142
00:12:37,091 --> 00:12:40,052
I see your point. Please continue, Bei-leye.

143
00:12:40,219 --> 00:12:43,013
The Imperial Court isn't the problem.

144
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:47,226
With royalty and officials everywhere

145
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:52,022
the Royal Guard keep security tight.

146
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:54,775
But Beijing is not like the Western provinces.

147
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:58,112
It's full of complex characters.

148
00:12:59,154 --> 00:13:02,199
Proceed with caution
in your quest for law and order.

149
00:13:02,283 --> 00:13:04,660
Don't depend only on the court.

150
00:13:04,743 --> 00:13:07,705
Keep some contacts
in the Jianghu underworld.

151
00:13:08,497 --> 00:13:10,582
It can ensure your position.

152
00:13:15,212 --> 00:13:18,674
Be strong yet supple.
This is the way to rule.

153
00:13:47,995 --> 00:13:49,371
Governess.

154
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:52,166
You may leave.

155
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:59,340
- Please sit.
- I've made a pair of silk pajamas.

156
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:02,301
- Want to change into them?
- Leave them there.

157
00:14:08,098 --> 00:14:10,726
I heard you met Yu Xiulian today.

158
00:14:11,602 --> 00:14:13,145
You know her?

159
00:14:14,355 --> 00:14:18,192
Your mother would not want you
consorting with her kind.

160
00:14:21,111 --> 00:14:23,572
I'll socialize with whomever I please.

161
00:14:23,781 --> 00:14:26,575
Don't invite danger
into your father's house.

162
00:14:29,745 --> 00:14:32,831
- I'm tired now!
- Go to bed then.

163
00:14:37,211 --> 00:14:39,922
Miss has grown up
and is getting married soon.

164
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:44,218
God knows what the future will bring.

165
00:14:45,177 --> 00:14:47,012
It'll be just the same.

166
00:14:47,846 --> 00:14:49,598
Enough, I'm tired.

167
00:14:54,353 --> 00:14:57,606
It's autumn now.
I'll shut the windows for you.

168
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:26,385
Chilly, eh?

169
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,673
Thief!

170
00:16:27,362 --> 00:16:30,324
Someone help! Catch the thief!

171
00:16:30,407 --> 00:16:32,242
He's on the rooftop!

172
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:37,664
The sword's been stolen! Someone help!

173
00:16:38,707 --> 00:16:40,959
He's on the roof! Stop, thief!

174
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:08,529
Catch him!

175
00:17:09,905 --> 00:17:11,698
Avenge my mother!

176
00:17:14,076 --> 00:17:17,037
What are you standing here for?
Go get him!

177
00:17:19,498 --> 00:17:22,251
Return the sword, and I'll let you go.

178
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:30,050
You've been trained at Wudang?

179
00:17:33,971 --> 00:17:36,723
We are street performers. You're wrong.

180
00:17:36,848 --> 00:17:39,518
- We're just practicing the stunts.
- Father-.

181
00:17:40,102 --> 00:17:43,188
Practicing? Who are you trying to fool?

182
00:17:43,772 --> 00:17:45,524
Where did they go?

183
00:17:56,952 --> 00:17:58,745
Governor Yu's house.

184
00:19:40,764 --> 00:19:42,349
Get down here!

185
00:19:58,532 --> 00:19:59,991
Give me the sword.

186
00:21:14,024 --> 00:21:16,359
Bei-leye awaits you in the great hall.

187
00:21:17,986 --> 00:21:19,446
I didn't get the sword back.

188
00:21:19,529 --> 00:21:23,283
But I'm sure the thief is in the Yu household.

189
00:21:23,366 --> 00:21:25,076
- How dare you!
- But I saw...

190
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,953
Enough! Get out!

191
00:21:38,632 --> 00:21:40,884
Has Governor Yu ever seen the sword?

192
00:21:41,301 --> 00:21:44,971
Yes, though I doubt he's involved in this.

193
00:21:45,555 --> 00:21:48,558
But the sword is somewhere
in his compound.

194
00:21:52,229 --> 00:21:56,358
Then someone's out to frame him.

195
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:59,903
We should get word
to Li Mubai about this.

196
00:22:04,825 --> 00:22:06,535
Watch your step, Madame Yu.

197
00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:12,040
- What is it?
- Someone's put Wanted posters up.

198
00:22:18,088 --> 00:22:19,548
Let me see.

199
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:30,267
Someone's after Jade Fox.
Preposterous, looking for her here!

200
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:50,787
- Best spear fighting in the world!
- The Yang School of Spear Fighting!

201
00:23:07,053 --> 00:23:09,931
- Where did they go?
- I really don't know.

202
00:23:10,891 --> 00:23:14,311
I saw them couple of days ago.
Probably gone by now.

203
00:24:05,695 --> 00:24:08,448
Miss, there's a Miss Yu Xiulian
asking to see you.

204
00:24:08,615 --> 00:24:11,451
- Our Lady is busy right now.
- I will tell her then.

205
00:24:11,534 --> 00:24:13,036
Show her in.

206
00:24:14,663 --> 00:24:15,830
Yes.

207
00:24:20,543 --> 00:24:23,213
This spells trouble.

208
00:24:25,215 --> 00:24:26,800
I have a guest now.

209
00:24:34,015 --> 00:24:36,184
This way please, Miss Yu.

210
00:24:42,232 --> 00:24:44,484
- I've missed you!
- How so?

211
00:24:44,567 --> 00:24:46,152
I have nothing to do.

212
00:24:53,034 --> 00:24:55,161
You're practicing calligraphy.

213
00:24:56,246 --> 00:24:59,416
I'll write your name. Just for fun.

214
00:25:25,942 --> 00:25:28,987
I never noticed that my name
looks like the word for sword.

215
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:32,866
You write gracefully.
Calligraphy is so similar to fencing.

216
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,952
Maybe it is. I wouldn't know.

217
00:25:37,954 --> 00:25:39,247
Please.

218
00:25:43,418 --> 00:25:46,629
Thank you for seeing me.
I hear your wedding day is near.

219
00:25:46,921 --> 00:25:49,132
You must be overwhelmed
with the preparations.

220
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:52,719
I'm hardly doing a thing.
The less I think of it, the better.

221
00:25:53,136 --> 00:25:57,932
My parents are arranging everything,
including the groom.

222
00:25:58,308 --> 00:26:02,312
Mother says the Gous
are a very powerful family.

223
00:26:02,729 --> 00:26:06,483
My marrying into this family
will give my dad's career a big boost.

224
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:10,236
It's a great fortune to marry
into such a noble family.

225
00:26:11,112 --> 00:26:15,283
Is it? Actually, I wish I were
like the great heroes in the books

226
00:26:15,658 --> 00:26:17,952
just like you and Li Mubai.

227
00:26:18,828 --> 00:26:20,497
Marriage is a good thing.

228
00:26:20,663 --> 00:26:23,083
But to be free to live my own life,

229
00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:26,836
to choose who I love
and love him in my own way.

230
00:26:28,171 --> 00:26:30,090
That's real happiness.

231
00:26:31,633 --> 00:26:35,470
- Think so? Let me tell you a story.
- About you and Li Mubai?

232
00:26:35,762 --> 00:26:39,599
Yes. I was once engaged
to be married when I was young.

233
00:26:41,017 --> 00:26:43,812
- Really?
- His name was Meng Si Zhao.

234
00:26:44,312 --> 00:26:47,023
He was a brother-by-oath to Li Mubai.

235
00:26:47,482 --> 00:26:49,692
One day,
while defending Li Mubai in battle

236
00:26:49,776 --> 00:26:53,029
he was killed by another man's sword.

237
00:26:53,947 --> 00:26:57,534
After Meng's sacrifice,
Li and I went through a lot together.

238
00:26:57,617 --> 00:26:59,661
Our feelings for each other grew stronger.

239
00:26:59,744 --> 00:27:03,915
But how could we dishonour Meng's memory?

240
00:27:04,124 --> 00:27:06,960
The freedom you talk about,
I too desire it,

241
00:27:07,293 --> 00:27:09,212
but I've never tasted it.

242
00:27:09,546 --> 00:27:12,048
It's not your fault, or Li Mubai's.

243
00:27:12,215 --> 00:27:15,552
Too bad for Meng,
but that's just the way things turn out.

244
00:27:17,554 --> 00:27:20,557
As a woman,
I still must abide by tradition

245
00:27:20,974 --> 00:27:25,520
even if I'm not an aristocrat like you.

246
00:27:26,146 --> 00:27:32,026
Don't distance us.
From now on, let's be sisters.

247
00:27:33,695 --> 00:27:38,366
All right. As a sister,
I hope you find real happiness.

248
00:28:14,694 --> 00:28:17,280
Miles and miles of nothing.

249
00:28:18,281 --> 00:28:22,076
Can't your father get an appointment
closer to civilization?

250
00:28:22,535 --> 00:28:23,953
This place!

251
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:28,625
Jiaolong, are you listening to me?

252
00:28:57,487 --> 00:28:58,821
Let's go!

253
00:29:22,887 --> 00:29:24,973
- Who are you?
- Dad!

254
00:29:25,056 --> 00:29:27,558
Hold it! I'm a friend!

255
00:29:31,354 --> 00:29:34,232
I don't care about your sword.

256
00:29:34,315 --> 00:29:38,695
- Why are you spying on the Yus?
- I'm looking for someone. Jade Fox.

257
00:29:39,529 --> 00:29:43,783
I'm a prefect from Shaanxi, 
Gansu district.

258
00:29:43,866 --> 00:29:47,829
This Jade Fox is a master criminal.
I hear she infiltrated the Yus.

259
00:29:48,037 --> 00:29:51,582
She must have come with them
when he transferred here.

260
00:29:52,041 --> 00:29:54,669
But I cannot just go in and catch her there.

261
00:29:54,752 --> 00:29:56,713
I have to lure her out.

262
00:29:56,796 --> 00:29:58,840
- This Jade Fox is a woman?
- You bet.

263
00:29:58,923 --> 00:30:01,134
Then leave her to me. Don't worry.

264
00:30:01,426 --> 00:30:04,053
Thank you, but I doubt you can handle her.

265
00:30:04,595 --> 00:30:08,641
My wife was quite skilled at martial arts.
Jade Fox killed her in four moves.

266
00:30:08,725 --> 00:30:13,396
It's both an official and a personal matter
to me.

267
00:30:14,897 --> 00:30:18,192
- Meatballs are ready!
- I'm more than ready for them.

268
00:30:18,943 --> 00:30:21,279
Wait, dad gets first dip!

269
00:30:23,906 --> 00:30:25,074
Hey!

270
00:30:26,075 --> 00:30:27,618
They are gone.

271
00:30:29,287 --> 00:30:30,663
What does it say?

272
00:30:30,747 --> 00:30:33,958
We'll settle this at midnight tonight
on Yellow Hill.

273
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:36,586
Good! The Fox is out of her hole.

274
00:30:38,504 --> 00:30:39,630
Please.

275
00:30:41,549 --> 00:30:43,801
Xiulian, look who's here.

276
00:30:49,682 --> 00:30:53,269
Bei-leye thinks it's not appropriate
to cast doubt on Governor Yu.

277
00:30:53,353 --> 00:30:56,981
But there is something amiss
in the Yu household. I'm investigating.

278
00:30:57,065 --> 00:30:58,608
What have you found?

279
00:31:11,204 --> 00:31:13,623
Jade Fox? Impossible!

280
00:31:13,956 --> 00:31:16,918
You'd always suspected
she'd fled to the west.

281
00:31:17,001 --> 00:31:19,295
I didn't think she'd dare 
come back to Beijing.

282
00:31:19,379 --> 00:31:23,049
Is there any place safer than
under the nose of Governor Yu?

283
00:31:25,134 --> 00:31:28,388
I shall avenge my master's death after all.

284
00:31:29,847 --> 00:31:32,266
But be careful, Mubai.

285
00:31:32,767 --> 00:31:34,936
Bei-leye requires discretion.

286
00:31:35,103 --> 00:31:37,688
Official business is already
difficult to resolve,

287
00:31:37,772 --> 00:31:41,359
it'd be a bigger mess
with your personal matters involved.

288
00:31:41,984 --> 00:31:44,862
And I don't know,
this flyer may not be reliable.

289
00:31:44,946 --> 00:31:46,948
It could be some sort of trap.

290
00:31:49,659 --> 00:31:52,036
- Did you see who posted it?
- No, it was done at night.

291
00:31:52,412 --> 00:31:54,539
It says Fox is hiding at Yu's.

292
00:31:54,956 --> 00:31:58,835
Bei-leye says the night of the theft
there was a fight in front of Yu's.

293
00:31:58,918 --> 00:32:00,920
Were you involved?

294
00:32:01,003 --> 00:32:04,173
No, that was Yoshi, 
Bei-leye's house guard.

295
00:32:04,257 --> 00:32:06,008
He followed the thief to the Yus.

296
00:32:06,092 --> 00:32:10,096
- Have you cross-examined him yet?
- Yoshi? No, not yet...

297
00:32:10,179 --> 00:32:13,099
But you have your men
watching over Yu's compound?

298
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:16,269
No, I'd already sent them back.

299
00:32:18,187 --> 00:32:20,565
You can blame me for losing the sword

300
00:32:20,648 --> 00:32:24,193
but trust me, I'll get it back soon
using my own methods.

301
00:32:25,862 --> 00:32:27,655
That's not what I meant.

302
00:32:27,738 --> 00:32:29,949
I don't care about the sword.

303
00:32:30,158 --> 00:32:33,619
What do you mean?
Didn't you come back here for it?

304
00:32:34,287 --> 00:32:37,415
I didn't know it was stolen until I got here.

305
00:32:38,916 --> 00:32:40,668
Then, why did you come?

306
00:32:42,879 --> 00:32:45,381
Well, we had talked...

307
00:32:48,926 --> 00:32:52,388
Pardon my intrusion.
Master Li, your room is ready.

308
00:32:54,807 --> 00:32:56,225
Thank you.

309
00:32:57,018 --> 00:32:58,895
Please, lead the way.

310
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:12,283
This Fox doesn't care much for punctuality.

311
00:33:12,366 --> 00:33:14,368
There's no sign of her.

312
00:33:22,251 --> 00:33:24,253
Halt! Show your face!

313
00:33:28,591 --> 00:33:30,885
Cai Qiu! You scum!

314
00:33:31,469 --> 00:33:33,888
Leave me alone or you'll 
pay with your life!

315
00:33:33,971 --> 00:33:36,557
That's what you think, old witch!

316
00:33:36,766 --> 00:33:39,936
If you surrender now, you'll suffer less.

317
00:33:40,228 --> 00:33:43,105
If you resist, I won't stop 
until you're dead.

318
00:33:43,272 --> 00:33:46,192
Father! Let me avenge my mother's death!

319
00:33:46,275 --> 00:33:48,528
You'll soon end up like her, 
you little whore!

320
00:33:48,611 --> 00:33:51,280
You'll pay for that, you old fox!

321
00:34:26,482 --> 00:34:27,650
Dad!

322
00:34:57,013 --> 00:35:00,516
- I'll Kill you! You ruined my life!
- Out of my way or I'll kill you too!

323
00:35:14,864 --> 00:35:17,241
Watch her hands! She'll paralyse you!

324
00:35:23,205 --> 00:35:24,832
Xiaomei!

325
00:35:33,299 --> 00:35:35,301
Die, you filthy dog!

326
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,722
An ambush! You cowards!

327
00:35:43,934 --> 00:35:46,103
- Dad, are you okay?
- I'm fine.

328
00:35:46,729 --> 00:35:49,565
The Wudang masters should have 
killed you long ago.

329
00:35:50,066 --> 00:35:52,193
You've had ten years too many, Jade Fox!

330
00:35:53,277 --> 00:35:55,613
You probably don't remember me.

331
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:58,574
But you remember my master.

332
00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:03,704
You infiltrated my clan while I was away.

333
00:36:03,788 --> 00:36:06,457
You poisoned my master
and stole the secret manual.

334
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:09,585
Now it's time for you to pay!

335
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,546
Your master had no respect for women.

336
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:15,675
I was good enough to sleep with
but not to teach.

337
00:36:15,758 --> 00:36:19,345
He deserved to die by a woman's hand!

338
00:36:59,635 --> 00:37:02,596
You stole the top secrets
of Wudang's martial arts.

339
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:05,766
But after ten years of training,
your moves are still undisciplined.

340
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:08,477
For you to die under a Wudang
sword today

341
00:37:10,354 --> 00:37:11,355
is no disgrace!

342
00:37:17,653 --> 00:37:20,823
My disciple! Fight with me!
We'll kill them all!

343
00:37:21,157 --> 00:37:25,075
- Fox has a disciple!
- Just let me get rid of that meddler!

344
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,002
Who are you?

345
00:37:34,962 --> 00:37:38,299
Why is the Green Destiny
in your possession?

346
00:37:38,883 --> 00:37:41,969
- What's it to you?
- My name is Li Mubai.

347
00:37:42,136 --> 00:37:44,513
The Green Destiny Sword is mine.

348
00:37:54,899 --> 00:37:57,234
Jade Fox can't be your master.

349
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:59,361
Where did you learn this "Xuan Piu" move?

350
00:37:59,445 --> 00:38:01,363
Just playing around.

351
00:38:06,911 --> 00:38:08,621
Who is your real master?

352
00:38:30,392 --> 00:38:33,062
- Let's go.
- I'll kill them once and for all.

353
00:38:37,733 --> 00:38:39,401
Let's go!

354
00:38:41,654 --> 00:38:42,738
Dad!

355
00:38:43,948 --> 00:38:45,074
Dad!

356
00:38:51,747 --> 00:38:52,790
Dad!

357
00:39:04,969 --> 00:39:06,512
This is Cai Qiu?

358
00:39:08,472 --> 00:39:12,059
My father. 
Prefect from Gansu, Cai Qiu.

359
00:39:13,769 --> 00:39:17,773
Homicide must be reported to Governor Yu.

360
00:39:18,607 --> 00:39:20,609
Particularly when the victim is an officer.

361
00:39:20,693 --> 00:39:24,238
Yet you say the killer is hiding 
out in Yu's compound?

362
00:39:25,656 --> 00:39:27,950
I'd stake my life on it, sir.

363
00:39:32,162 --> 00:39:33,706
Come with me.

364
00:39:35,499 --> 00:39:38,294
This needs to be resolved quickly,
before there is a scandal.

365
00:39:39,169 --> 00:39:42,131
I'll get into the Yu household and get her.

366
00:39:42,506 --> 00:39:45,426
I'll ferret out this Fox
and her gang in no time.

367
00:39:45,509 --> 00:39:50,139
Too dangerous. Yu is a court official
and in charge of security.

368
00:39:50,556 --> 00:39:53,058
This could ruin his reputation and career.

369
00:39:53,142 --> 00:39:55,477
It might also get Bei-leye in trouble.

370
00:39:57,479 --> 00:39:59,440
This calls for the utmost delicacy.

371
00:39:59,523 --> 00:40:05,112
Bei-leye, can you find some excuse
to invite Madame Yu and her daughter?

372
00:40:06,697 --> 00:40:08,490
What do you have in mind?

373
00:40:09,825 --> 00:40:13,078
The best way to trap a fox
is through her cubs.

374
00:40:16,206 --> 00:40:21,587
Oh, my! Bei-leye's wife is spoiling 
us with all these wedding gifts.

375
00:40:21,921 --> 00:40:24,924
She is being so considerate
to our daughter.

376
00:40:25,049 --> 00:40:28,344
I'm sorry she's not feeling well enough
to entertain you today.

377
00:40:28,427 --> 00:40:31,138
I heard Bei-leye has lost something.

378
00:40:31,347 --> 00:40:34,224
And now his wife is not feeling well.

379
00:40:34,725 --> 00:40:37,353
We know who stole the missing item.

380
00:40:40,356 --> 00:40:43,525
If the thief returns it

381
00:40:43,859 --> 00:40:47,196
I'm sure Bei-leye will pursue
the matter no further.

382
00:40:47,404 --> 00:40:48,906
That's good.

383
00:40:49,198 --> 00:40:53,369
It's an emparassment when the help 
can't keep their hands to themselves.

384
00:40:54,036 --> 00:40:57,790
Bei-leye knows that even well-meaning
people sometimes make mistakes.

385
00:40:57,873 --> 00:41:00,167
Some mistakes can ruin
not only themselves

386
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:02,586
but their entire family as well.

387
00:41:03,796 --> 00:41:05,714
But don't be too lenient.

388
00:41:05,923 --> 00:41:08,968
Yes, and I'm sure we will see
no mercy granted to the murderer

389
00:41:09,051 --> 00:41:11,303
who just turned up in Beijing.

390
00:41:11,553 --> 00:41:14,682
- A murderer?
- Yes,

391
00:41:14,848 --> 00:41:18,560
the very killer of Li Mubai's own master.

392
00:41:18,936 --> 00:41:22,856
Last night she killed an official
who had tracked her for many years.

393
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:25,567
A female criminal! Now that's news!

394
00:41:25,901 --> 00:41:28,904
You say she killed an officer?

395
00:41:29,405 --> 00:41:30,823
Yes, from the west.

396
00:41:30,906 --> 00:41:34,576
He went undercover as a street performer,
and followed her here.

397
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:38,998
I'm no detective, but maybe
the murderer and thief are the same.

398
00:41:39,289 --> 00:41:40,833
I doubt that.

399
00:41:41,417 --> 00:41:45,421
This particular thief is very unusual.

400
00:41:45,629 --> 00:41:48,590
And much smarter than a mere killer.

401
00:42:00,602 --> 00:42:04,940
- Jiaolong humbly greets you, Bei-leye.
- Hello, Mrs Yu.

402
00:42:05,274 --> 00:42:08,652
Let me introduce Li Mubai,
the renowned swordsman.

403
00:42:09,194 --> 00:42:11,989
It's a pleasure to meet you,
Mrs Yu, Ms Yu.

404
00:42:12,114 --> 00:42:14,616
Ms Yu is getting married soon.

405
00:42:17,286 --> 00:42:18,954
May your future be fortunate.

406
00:42:32,885 --> 00:42:34,887
Why don't you come in?

407
00:42:35,137 --> 00:42:39,475
- I'm standing guard.
- Come in. It's cold.

408
00:42:45,647 --> 00:42:49,151
Come in. We don't have to fear
Jade Fox if we're together.

409
00:43:13,842 --> 00:43:16,345
Isn't it a little late to be out?

410
00:43:19,181 --> 00:43:21,141
You can give the sword to me.

411
00:43:21,809 --> 00:43:23,685
I'll do as I please.

412
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:30,025
- Where's your master?
- None of your business!

413
00:43:56,552 --> 00:43:58,053
Had enough flying?

414
00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:03,267
You've got potential.

415
00:44:03,350 --> 00:44:07,229
You've studied the Wudang manual
but you do not understand it.

416
00:44:10,232 --> 00:44:12,734
You need a real master.

417
00:44:13,110 --> 00:44:15,696
A master like you? It's a meaningless title.

418
00:44:15,779 --> 00:44:17,406
You're right, it's all meaningless.

419
00:44:17,489 --> 00:44:20,492
School is meaningless,
the secret manual is meaningless

420
00:44:20,576 --> 00:44:23,579
even this sword.
It is just a state of mind.

421
00:44:24,621 --> 00:44:28,000
Don't talk like a monk
just because you're in a temple. Just fight!

422
00:44:28,083 --> 00:44:31,420
- Then tell me where Jade Fox is!
- Defend yourself!

423
00:44:45,475 --> 00:44:48,395
True sharpness is effortless.

424
00:45:05,621 --> 00:45:07,789
No growth without assistance.
No action without reaction.

425
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:11,126
No passion without control.

426
00:45:12,002 --> 00:45:13,795
Know your limits.

427
00:45:14,087 --> 00:45:16,798
Give yourself up and find yourself again.

428
00:45:17,966 --> 00:45:20,344
There is your first lesson.

429
00:45:25,474 --> 00:45:26,850
Go ahead.

430
00:45:28,685 --> 00:45:30,896
Why should I? You need practice.

431
00:45:30,979 --> 00:45:33,649
I can teach you to fight with the 
Green Destiny,

432
00:45:33,982 --> 00:45:36,777
but first you must learn 
to hold it in stillness.

433
00:45:39,321 --> 00:45:41,323
Why do you want to teach me?

434
00:45:42,866 --> 00:45:47,746
I've always wanted a disciple
truly worthy of the Wudang secrets.

435
00:45:49,873 --> 00:45:52,751
Aren't you afraid that I'd kill you
once I mastered it?

436
00:45:52,834 --> 00:45:56,088
That's a risk I'm willing to take
as your teacher.

437
00:45:56,171 --> 00:46:00,092
Deep down you're good. Even Jade Fox
hasn't been able to corrupt you.

438
00:46:01,969 --> 00:46:05,514
Wudang is a whorehouse!
Keep your lessons to yourself!

439
00:46:24,574 --> 00:46:27,494
You're home late, or should I say early?

440
00:46:30,372 --> 00:46:34,459
Why are you still here?
You've killed an official!

441
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:37,921
You'll bring ruin on my whole family.

442
00:46:38,213 --> 00:46:42,092
They wouldn't have tracked me here
if you hadn't stolen the sword.

443
00:46:42,509 --> 00:46:46,054
You're not a little girl any more.
Did you think stealing would be fun?

444
00:46:46,388 --> 00:46:48,390
That death is on your head 
as well as mine.

445
00:46:48,515 --> 00:46:50,559
Come with me, Jiaolong.

446
00:46:50,684 --> 00:46:53,103
You don't want to waste your life

447
00:46:53,562 --> 00:46:57,316
as the wife of some pompous bureaucrat.

448
00:46:57,858 --> 00:47:01,611
- As master and disciple, we will rule.
- I'll never live as a criminal.

449
00:47:01,737 --> 00:47:03,697
Stealing that sword already 
made you a criminal!

450
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:07,198
That was just for fun.
Why would I leave? Where would I go?

451
00:47:08,243 --> 00:47:11,830
Wherever we want.
We'll get rid of anyone in our way.

452
00:47:11,913 --> 00:47:14,041
- Even your father.
- Shut up!

453
00:47:14,124 --> 00:47:17,627
That's Jianghu way of life.
Kill or be killed.

454
00:47:18,253 --> 00:47:20,922
Exciting, isn't it?

455
00:47:25,052 --> 00:47:29,598
- I owe you nothing.
- Yes, you do!

456
00:47:31,350 --> 00:47:35,103
To have you as my disciple
is the thing in my life I'm most proud of.

457
00:47:42,152 --> 00:47:46,448
You think you've been teaching me
all these years from the manual?

458
00:47:46,948 --> 00:47:49,242
You can't even read.

459
00:47:51,244 --> 00:47:53,872
I studied the diagrams,
and you studied the words.

460
00:47:53,955 --> 00:47:56,041
You hid the details from me?

461
00:47:56,124 --> 00:48:00,212
You wouldn't have understood it
even if you knew how to read it.

462
00:48:00,337 --> 00:48:04,049
You know you've gone
as far as you can go.

463
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:07,844
I hid my skills from you because
I was afraid it would hurt you.

464
00:48:10,347 --> 00:48:13,350
If I hadn't seen you fight
with Li Mubai,

465
00:48:14,393 --> 00:48:17,813
I'd still be ignorant
of all you've hidden from me.

466
00:48:20,690 --> 00:48:21,900
Master.

467
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:26,947
I started learning from you
in secret when I was 1O.

468
00:48:27,364 --> 00:48:30,575
You enchanted me with the dream
of the Jianghu underworld.

469
00:48:30,659 --> 00:48:33,954
But once I realised I could surpass you,

470
00:48:34,704 --> 00:48:37,290
you can't imagine how frightened I was!

471
00:48:37,874 --> 00:48:41,586
I had no one to guide me,
no one to follow,

472
00:48:43,422 --> 00:48:45,298
no one to learn from.

473
00:48:47,384 --> 00:48:51,263
Believe me, my lessons aren't over yet.

474
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:07,047
Are you happy now that the sword is back?

475
00:50:08,507 --> 00:50:12,093
I admit, getting it back made me realise
how much I missed it.

476
00:50:13,970 --> 00:50:16,306
But it's no longer yours any more, is it?

477
00:50:16,389 --> 00:50:18,266
You gave it to Bei-leye.

478
00:50:20,185 --> 00:50:24,689
True. But I must borrow it 
for one final task.

479
00:50:25,565 --> 00:50:27,943
Jade Fox will die on its edge.

480
00:50:31,530 --> 00:50:36,076
Did you know what you were hiding
when you covered for that girl?

481
00:50:36,826 --> 00:50:40,288
My job was to recover the sword
without embarrassing anyone.

482
00:50:40,914 --> 00:50:45,669
I wasn't about to ruin her life,
or her father.

483
00:50:46,127 --> 00:50:47,629
You did your job well.

484
00:50:47,712 --> 00:50:51,216
The sword is back. But... this girl.

485
00:50:52,801 --> 00:50:54,678
I saw her last night.

486
00:50:56,638 --> 00:50:58,848
I knew she would intrigue you.

487
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:00,976
She needs controlling.

488
00:51:01,184 --> 00:51:03,812
She needs real direction and training.

489
00:51:04,521 --> 00:51:07,691
She's an aristocrat's daughter,
she's not one of us.

490
00:51:07,816 --> 00:51:13,321
It will all be over soon.
You'll kill Fox and Jiaolong will marry.

491
00:51:15,574 --> 00:51:19,536
That's not for her. She should come to 
Wudang and become a disciple.

492
00:51:20,996 --> 00:51:23,039
But Wudang doesn't accept women.

493
00:51:23,373 --> 00:51:26,001
For her, perhaps they could make
an exception.

494
00:51:26,084 --> 00:51:30,005
If not, left to her own, I'm afraid
she'll become a poisonous dragon.

495
00:51:30,630 --> 00:51:33,174
It's not our affair.

496
00:51:33,508 --> 00:51:37,637
Even if Wudang accepts her,
her husband might object.

497
00:51:41,683 --> 00:51:46,187
I thought by giving away the sword,
I could escape the Jianghu world.

498
00:51:46,521 --> 00:51:49,816
But the cycle of bloodshed continues.

499
00:51:51,693 --> 00:51:53,528
I had hoped so, too.

500
00:51:54,070 --> 00:51:57,198
I wish there were something
I could do to help you.

501
00:52:02,370 --> 00:52:05,040
Just be patient with me, Xiulian.

502
00:52:21,890 --> 00:52:23,099
Don't move!

503
00:52:26,686 --> 00:52:29,022
- Xiaohu!
- Jiaolong!

504
00:52:42,285 --> 00:52:44,412
You shouldn't have come.

505
00:52:46,414 --> 00:52:49,542
With all the traffic
on your rooftop these days

506
00:52:50,126 --> 00:52:54,089
it took me a while to get in here.
I can't wait any longer, Jiaolong.

507
00:52:54,214 --> 00:52:56,049
I was wrong to let you go.

508
00:52:57,384 --> 00:53:00,637
Come with me, back to the desert.
You'll be free there.

509
00:53:01,096 --> 00:53:03,098
You can do whatever you want.

510
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:08,728
<i>You have been looking for me all this time?</i>

511
00:53:31,334 --> 00:53:33,461
Jiaolong, stop playing with it.

512
00:53:34,796 --> 00:53:36,548
I won't break it, mother.

513
00:53:58,778 --> 00:53:59,988
Charge!

514
00:54:02,824 --> 00:54:03,992
Stop!

515
00:54:04,993 --> 00:54:06,578
It's Dark Cloud!

516
00:54:06,661 --> 00:54:08,580
Dark Cloud is coming!

517
00:54:24,304 --> 00:54:27,015
Lower the shade, don't be seen!

518
00:54:27,098 --> 00:54:29,100
Don't be afraid, Miss.

519
00:54:44,866 --> 00:54:47,202
Don't touch the women!

520
00:55:33,915 --> 00:55:36,042
Catch up! Come get it!

521
00:56:24,757 --> 00:56:25,800
Hey!

522
00:56:27,176 --> 00:56:29,846
Your mother will miss you.
Hurry back to her.

523
00:57:29,364 --> 00:57:30,657
Hey!

524
00:57:31,658 --> 00:57:34,452
She's mine! Leave her to me!

525
00:57:44,879 --> 00:57:47,840
- Let's take a break.
- Give me back my comb!

526
00:57:50,051 --> 00:57:52,387
Take a break.

527
00:57:53,888 --> 00:57:56,182
You're tired. You need rest.

528
00:58:02,230 --> 00:58:05,525
Your horse needs water.
There's a stream up here.

529
00:58:13,074 --> 00:58:15,743
Well, there was when I last visited.

530
00:58:22,709 --> 00:58:23,876
Your name?

531
00:58:25,169 --> 00:58:28,423
My name is Luo Xiaohu.
The Hans call me Dark Cloud.

532
00:58:29,215 --> 00:58:32,552
I'm not that tall or that big,
but I'm quick as lightning.

533
00:58:33,011 --> 00:58:34,178
Here.

534
00:58:45,898 --> 00:58:47,400
Give me my comb.

535
01:00:23,162 --> 01:00:25,915
If you like that, I can make you a bow.

536
01:00:26,374 --> 01:00:28,501
Great for hunting wild chicken.

537
01:00:28,709 --> 01:00:30,378
They're delicious.

538
01:00:35,883 --> 01:00:38,594
You need to eat something. Understand?

539
01:00:39,637 --> 01:00:42,640
That way, you'll have the strength to fight.

540
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:46,018
Understand?

541
01:00:55,278 --> 01:00:58,447
You'll slowly regain your strength.
Don't rush.

542
01:03:04,573 --> 01:03:07,868
You have a bad temper.
It's much better this way.

543
01:03:14,417 --> 01:03:15,876
You coward!

544
01:03:19,213 --> 01:03:22,633
You're still mad? 
At least you're speaking.

545
01:03:23,551 --> 01:03:25,177
What's your name?

546
01:03:26,762 --> 01:03:29,765
Pei? I didn't know the Hans 
had such beautiful names.

547
01:04:09,388 --> 01:04:13,642
Relax. If I wanted to do what you're 
thinking, I'd have done it already.

548
01:04:14,977 --> 01:04:17,104
You must be dying for a bath.

549
01:04:17,188 --> 01:04:20,483
The water source is far,
and difficult to get to.

550
01:04:21,317 --> 01:04:23,736
I managed to bring back some fresh water.

551
01:04:23,819 --> 01:04:26,364
You can wear my clothes
when you are done.

552
01:04:26,781 --> 01:04:28,324
They're clean.

553
01:04:44,465 --> 01:04:45,925
Don't worry.

554
01:04:48,302 --> 01:04:51,305
I'll sing a song, so you'll know where I am.

555
01:04:52,890 --> 01:04:55,893
After the bath, you will calm down a little.

556
01:04:57,144 --> 01:05:00,064
But promise me,
no more rocks on the head.

557
01:06:12,011 --> 01:06:16,223
- All this trouble, just for a comb?
- It's mine.

558
01:06:17,766 --> 01:06:21,896
And it's worth a lot to me.
But to a barbarian like you, it's nothing.

559
01:06:22,521 --> 01:06:25,983
Not true. I can use it
to pick fleas from my horse.

560
01:06:26,942 --> 01:06:29,570
By the way, I'm a real Manchurian.

561
01:06:32,156 --> 01:06:34,408
I'm sorry, I guessed wrong.

562
01:06:35,075 --> 01:06:37,161
I thought you were a Han.

563
01:06:39,288 --> 01:06:40,915
Give me back my comb.

564
01:06:45,169 --> 01:06:47,671
I don't take orders from anyone.

565
01:06:54,261 --> 01:06:55,804
Give it to me.

566
01:08:13,924 --> 01:08:16,844
<i>One night, when I was a boy</i>

567
01:08:16,927 --> 01:08:19,888
<i>I saw a thousand stars fall out of the sky.</i>

568
01:08:21,181 --> 01:08:24,143
<i>I remember thinking,
where did they all go?</i>

569
01:08:24,643 --> 01:08:27,771
<i>I'm an orphan.
I used to look for stars alone.</i>

570
01:08:29,773 --> 01:08:33,527
Maybe if I rode to the other end
of the desert, I'd find them.

571
01:08:35,654 --> 01:08:38,574
I've been riding in the desert ever since.

572
01:08:40,117 --> 01:08:42,703
And so that little boy became
a fearsome bandit.

573
01:08:42,786 --> 01:08:46,123
Couldn't find the stars, so now 
he robs young girls of their combs.

574
01:08:47,207 --> 01:08:50,210
Out there,
you're always fighting for survival.

575
01:08:51,253 --> 01:08:54,214
You have to gang up
just to stand a chance.

576
01:08:54,965 --> 01:08:57,885
Slowly, your gang becomes your family.

577
01:08:59,011 --> 01:09:02,222
All that Dark Cloud stuff
is just to scare people

578
01:09:02,306 --> 01:09:04,308
but it does make my life easier.

579
01:09:05,434 --> 01:09:08,103
So you are still the little boy at heart

580
01:09:08,187 --> 01:09:10,105
looking for fallen stars.

581
01:09:11,899 --> 01:09:17,613
A grown man, gazing at the sky, thinking that 
the brightest star has fallen at his side.

582
01:09:40,636 --> 01:09:43,347
Your father's men are looking for you.

583
01:10:13,544 --> 01:10:16,422
They're still out there, circling closer.

584
01:10:18,132 --> 01:10:19,717
They'll stop some day.

585
01:10:21,009 --> 01:10:23,971
They won't, and we'll be running forever.

586
01:10:26,140 --> 01:10:28,726
Don't send me back.

587
01:10:30,811 --> 01:10:32,271
You must decide.

588
01:10:32,604 --> 01:10:35,607
You might get tired of this

589
01:10:37,484 --> 01:10:39,820
and start missing your family.

590
01:10:40,988 --> 01:10:43,991
If we had a daughter,
we'd look for her, too.

591
01:10:44,158 --> 01:10:45,909
She'd miss us, too.

592
01:10:51,749 --> 01:10:55,377
Jiaolong, I want you to be mine forever.

593
01:10:57,379 --> 01:11:01,508
What if I make my mark on the world,
earn your parents' respect?

594
01:11:02,801 --> 01:11:06,764
We nomads have a legend. Anyone
who dares to jump from the mountain,

595
01:11:07,055 --> 01:11:09,224
Will have their greatest wish fulfilled.

596
01:11:09,975 --> 01:11:13,520
A long time ago, a man's parents were ill,
so he jumped.

597
01:11:14,938 --> 01:11:17,691
He didn't die, wasn't even wounded.

598
01:11:19,026 --> 01:11:22,196
He just floated away, far away,
never to return.

599
01:11:23,781 --> 01:11:25,824
He knew his wish had come true.

600
01:11:27,201 --> 01:11:29,536
If you believe in it, it will happen.

601
01:11:30,370 --> 01:11:32,456
I've asked Han people, they say,

602
01:11:32,915 --> 01:11:35,793
"A sincere heart will make
your dreams come true."

603
01:11:46,428 --> 01:11:48,055
Keep it safe.

604
01:11:49,306 --> 01:11:52,059
And return it to me
when we are together again.

605
01:11:54,603 --> 01:11:55,896
I will.

606
01:12:03,445 --> 01:12:07,241
If you don't return it to me,
I will have to chase you down.

607
01:12:07,991 --> 01:12:10,702
And next time, I won't go easy on you.

608
01:12:22,464 --> 01:12:25,926
<i>Wherever I went,
they always recognised me.</i>

609
01:12:26,718 --> 01:12:28,303
I really tried.

610
01:12:31,598 --> 01:12:35,435
I heard you came to Beijing.
I was afraid I'd never see you again.

611
01:12:36,436 --> 01:12:38,063
So I came.

612
01:12:39,147 --> 01:12:41,859
I can't let you get married like that.

613
01:12:45,112 --> 01:12:46,196
Go back.

614
01:12:47,197 --> 01:12:48,407
Jiaolong.

615
01:12:51,201 --> 01:12:54,204
- Don't ever come back.
- So it's over?

616
01:12:56,456 --> 01:12:57,624
Yes.

617
01:13:13,348 --> 01:13:15,601
We heard noises. Is everything all right?

618
01:13:15,684 --> 01:13:17,769
Fine. It was just a cat.

619
01:13:34,870 --> 01:13:37,331
You think Jade Fox will show up?

620
01:13:37,581 --> 01:13:39,333
She must be nearby.

621
01:13:39,917 --> 01:13:42,336
But I doubt she'll let herself be seen.

622
01:13:42,836 --> 01:13:48,258
We'll keep our eyes open.
She'll come for the girl sooner or later.

623
01:14:07,903 --> 01:14:09,738
Jiaolong!

624
01:14:17,412 --> 01:14:20,123
Go back to Xinjiang with me!

625
01:14:25,087 --> 01:14:29,508
Let go of me!

626
01:14:34,137 --> 01:14:35,389
You're mine!

627
01:14:35,889 --> 01:14:37,891
Go back to the desert with me!

628
01:14:50,737 --> 01:14:53,448
Jiaolong, come back to Xinjiang with me!

629
01:14:59,329 --> 01:15:03,041
- Tell me. Where is Jade Fox?
- Come with me. Hurry.

630
01:15:06,962 --> 01:15:10,757
You really thought she'd give it all up
and go back west with you?

631
01:15:12,300 --> 01:15:15,137
- She's mine.
- Whether she's yours or not

632
01:15:15,429 --> 01:15:19,099
you will be no good to her dead.
With Gou and Yu hunting you,

633
01:15:19,182 --> 01:15:21,935
it won't be long until
you're in their hands.

634
01:15:22,310 --> 01:15:24,271
I don't care any more.

635
01:15:26,106 --> 01:15:29,276
If you truly loved her,
you wouldn't say that.

636
01:15:31,445 --> 01:15:33,947
Don't you want to see her again?

637
01:15:36,450 --> 01:15:40,037
I'll write an introduction for you.
Take it to Wudang Mountain.

638
01:15:40,203 --> 01:15:42,456
Wait there for news from me.

639
01:15:44,708 --> 01:15:45,959
Okay.

640
01:15:54,342 --> 01:15:56,887
When will this end?

641
01:15:57,137 --> 01:15:59,973
They take it, put it back, and take it again.

642
01:16:00,140 --> 01:16:03,310
My home is turning into a warehouse.

643
01:16:04,311 --> 01:16:05,562
Come in.

644
01:16:07,355 --> 01:16:09,816
- Speak.
- Yu Jiaolong has run away.

645
01:16:10,150 --> 01:16:12,402
The groom found her missing.

646
01:16:12,486 --> 01:16:15,030
Governor Yu requests your assistance

647
01:16:15,489 --> 01:16:18,116
since you know
the Jianghu underworld so well.

648
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:21,203
He wants to find her
and keep her from harm.

649
01:16:22,245 --> 01:16:25,499
Bei-leye, leave this to us. Don't worry.

650
01:16:44,392 --> 01:16:46,353
What can I bring you?

651
01:16:48,188 --> 01:16:50,023
A clean cup.

652
01:17:04,538 --> 01:17:09,543
Hi there. May I ask your name?

653
01:17:10,627 --> 01:17:11,878
Long.

654
01:17:13,630 --> 01:17:16,550
It's young master Long. My apologies!

655
01:17:17,050 --> 01:17:19,386
I'm Iron Eagle Sung Ming.

656
01:17:20,053 --> 01:17:23,473
This is my fellow brother,
Flying Cougar Li Yun.

657
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:27,477
What brings you to Huai'an
and where are you headed, Master Long?

658
01:17:28,937 --> 01:17:31,064
Anywhere there's action.

659
01:17:31,231 --> 01:17:34,901
In that case,
perhaps we could be of assistance.

660
01:17:36,278 --> 01:17:37,821
Don't bother.

661
01:17:39,447 --> 01:17:41,908
You don't seem to have understood.

662
01:17:43,910 --> 01:17:45,745
And if I haven't?

663
01:17:47,080 --> 01:17:50,625
We have ways of helping you understand.

664
01:17:59,176 --> 01:18:01,761
Are you related to Li Mubai?

665
01:18:04,431 --> 01:18:06,600
He's my defeated foe.

666
01:18:25,160 --> 01:18:26,536
Some tea.

667
01:18:56,066 --> 01:18:57,359
Xiulian.

668
01:18:57,901 --> 01:19:00,737
Things we can touch have no permanence.

669
01:19:03,073 --> 01:19:04,866
My master used to say,

670
01:19:04,991 --> 01:19:07,827
"There's nothing we can hold onto
in this world.

671
01:19:09,579 --> 01:19:12,874
"Only by letting go can we
truly possess what is real."

672
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:18,004
Even to an old Taoist like you,
not everything is an illusion.

673
01:19:18,213 --> 01:19:21,800
When you were holding my hand just now,
wasn't that real?

674
01:19:24,386 --> 01:19:28,765
Your hand is rough and calloused.
The hand of a broadsword master.

675
01:19:29,224 --> 01:19:31,937
All these years, I've longed to 
touch it, and never had the courage.

676
01:19:35,772 --> 01:19:33,441
Xiulian, Jianghu is a world of
crouching tigers and hidden dragons.

677
01:19:38,525 --> 01:19:40,694
but so are human feelings.

678
01:19:40,902 --> 01:19:44,906
Swords and knives harbour unknown
perils, but so do human relationships.

679
01:19:46,199 --> 01:19:48,868
I gave away the Green Destiny
with sincerity.

680
01:19:49,035 --> 01:19:51,413
But it brought us more troubles.

681
01:19:51,538 --> 01:19:54,582
Repressing your feelings
will only make them stronger.

682
01:19:54,708 --> 01:19:56,418
I can't repress my desire.

683
01:19:57,711 --> 01:19:59,879
I want to be with you.

684
01:20:02,549 --> 01:20:04,259
Just sitting like this

685
01:20:05,969 --> 01:20:08,179
gives me a sense of peace.

686
01:20:26,740 --> 01:20:28,450
Please follow me.

687
01:20:30,285 --> 01:20:33,580
- I want a clean room.
- There are plenty of rooms.

688
01:20:35,623 --> 01:20:38,668
- What would you like to eat?
- Some steamed cod, fried ribs,

689
01:20:38,752 --> 01:20:41,212
meatballs, not too big, a little 
starchy, but keep the sauce light!

690
01:20:41,296 --> 01:20:44,674
And cabbage shark fin soup, mixed 
vegetables, and a bottle of warm rose wine.

691
01:20:44,758 --> 01:20:47,469
I have to order them from
a bigger restaurant.

692
01:20:47,594 --> 01:20:49,596
- Hurry then.
- Yes.

693
01:21:32,305 --> 01:21:33,681
It's him.

694
01:21:42,524 --> 01:21:44,692
I am Iron Arm Mi Dabiao.

695
01:21:44,984 --> 01:21:48,571
I heard a true master has arrived.

696
01:21:48,655 --> 01:21:50,949
I seek a lesson.

697
01:22:03,503 --> 01:22:05,004
Then it is a lesson you shall have!

698
01:22:25,358 --> 01:22:27,318
What kind of Iron Arm are you?

699
01:22:42,584 --> 01:22:46,671
That's amazing technique!
I am Flying sabre.

700
01:22:46,754 --> 01:22:49,382
Are you related to Southern Crane?

701
01:22:49,883 --> 01:22:52,844
Southern Duck?
I don't eat anything with two feet.

702
01:22:53,094 --> 01:22:55,430
Who could remember such lengthy names?

703
01:22:55,680 --> 01:22:56,723
You!

704
01:22:56,848 --> 01:23:01,686
If Li Mubai is your defeated foe,
why don't you know his master?

705
01:23:03,021 --> 01:23:04,272
Who are you?

706
01:23:05,398 --> 01:23:09,777
I'm called Shining Phoenix Mountain 
Gou Jun Sihung.

707
01:23:10,695 --> 01:23:14,115
Gou? I hate that name.

708
01:23:14,282 --> 01:23:16,701
It makes me want to vomit.

709
01:23:16,784 --> 01:23:21,247
For having that name, You'll be 
the first to taste my sword today!

710
01:23:43,603 --> 01:23:47,607
Hold it! Don't you know Monk Jing?

711
01:23:48,399 --> 01:23:51,027
A monk eating meat and not reading
scriptures? You need a lesson, too.

712
01:23:51,110 --> 01:23:55,281
- Who the hell are you?
- Who am I?

713
01:23:55,490 --> 01:23:56,741
I am...

714
01:23:56,824 --> 01:23:58,952
Be careful of her sword!

715
01:24:01,788 --> 01:24:04,624
...the invincible Sword Goddess

716
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:10,588
with the Green Destiny
that knows no equal!

717
01:24:15,468 --> 01:24:17,971
Be it Li or Southern Crane,

718
01:24:19,597 --> 01:24:22,267
lower your head and ask for mercy!

719
01:24:29,482 --> 01:24:31,818
I'm the dragon from the desert

720
01:24:40,952 --> 01:24:43,830
who appears from nowhere, 
and leaes no trace!

721
01:24:54,173 --> 01:24:57,510
Today I fly over Mount Emei,

722
01:24:59,679 --> 01:25:03,349
tomorrow, I'll topple Wudang Mountain!

723
01:25:18,823 --> 01:25:22,869
We politely asked for a friendly match,
but she showed no respect

724
01:25:23,077 --> 01:25:24,370
and started to reproach and attack us.

725
01:25:24,454 --> 01:25:28,124
My friends offered to come by
and teach her a lesson.

726
01:25:28,207 --> 01:25:30,376
Her sword is just too powerful.

727
01:25:30,543 --> 01:25:34,088
I've traveled far and wide,
but I've never met anyone that uncivilized.

728
01:25:34,172 --> 01:25:38,092
She kept accusing me of being
the brother of Gou Junpei.

729
01:25:38,509 --> 01:25:41,220
Who is this Gou Junpei, anyway?

730
01:25:43,056 --> 01:25:44,557
Her husband.

731
01:25:56,736 --> 01:26:00,615
Sun Security is nearby. Why don't you
go home and see how things are going?

732
01:26:00,698 --> 01:26:04,202
- What about you?
- l'll look around and catch up later.

733
01:26:04,577 --> 01:26:07,705
Not a bad idea.
Let's stay at Sun Security tonight.

734
01:26:07,789 --> 01:26:09,916
- Get a good night's sleep.
- Yes.

735
01:26:35,608 --> 01:26:37,276
- You are back.
- Yes.

736
01:26:41,948 --> 01:26:43,825
You're back, Master!

737
01:26:45,451 --> 01:26:47,870
- Hello guys. How's home?
- Things are fine.

738
01:26:47,954 --> 01:26:51,416
- You've been gone a while.
- Something came up. I leave tomorrow.

739
01:26:51,499 --> 01:26:53,543
- Ah Wei, your wife was due?
- Yes, a baby girl.

740
01:26:53,626 --> 01:26:56,713
- A girl? Good.
- I'd be happy if she grows up like you.

741
01:26:58,005 --> 01:27:00,925
- Mrs Wu.
- You're back!

742
01:27:01,342 --> 01:27:04,220
- How's the arm? Still sore?
- Much better.

743
01:27:04,721 --> 01:27:06,639
I've been worried about you.

744
01:27:07,890 --> 01:27:10,643
Mrs Wu,
Li Mubai is coming to stay the night.

745
01:27:12,145 --> 01:27:15,064
Really? I'll go and tidy up the room then.

746
01:27:44,260 --> 01:27:45,720
Sister Yu!

747
01:27:52,351 --> 01:27:55,521
Here, let's get you some proper clothes.

748
01:27:55,605 --> 01:27:59,150
I'm just borrowing them.
I'm not staying.

749
01:28:00,693 --> 01:28:04,197
You get around pretty well.
I don't think you need my clothes.

750
01:28:05,573 --> 01:28:09,202
I just happened to be around.
I wanted to see how you're doing.

751
01:28:10,703 --> 01:28:12,205
Sister...

752
01:28:15,041 --> 01:28:17,877
Now, now.
With all the trouble you've caused,

753
01:28:17,960 --> 01:28:20,713
now you know what Jianghu life
is really like.

754
01:28:20,797 --> 01:28:23,966
You came here,
that means you think of me as your sister.

755
01:28:24,050 --> 01:28:27,011
If so, let me give you some sisterly advice.

756
01:28:27,512 --> 01:28:31,098
You don't have to marry,
you can't just leave your parents.

757
01:28:31,641 --> 01:28:34,477
They forced me to marry.

758
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:38,523
Go back to your parents first.
Then you can decide about Xiaohu.

759
01:28:40,566 --> 01:28:42,360
You know about Xiaohu?

760
01:28:50,409 --> 01:28:53,329
He really loves you.

761
01:28:54,247 --> 01:28:58,209
Come back to Beijing with me.
We'll figure a way out for you.

762
01:29:02,547 --> 01:29:05,967
- Where is he now?
- Li Mubai has made arrangements.

763
01:29:07,552 --> 01:29:11,264
- Li Mubai?
- He sent him to Wudang Mountain.

764
01:29:12,849 --> 01:29:15,768
So, you're all working together
to set me up.

765
01:29:15,935 --> 01:29:18,104
Jiaolong, shut up! How dare you accuse us!

766
01:29:18,271 --> 01:29:20,773
From the beginning,
I knew you stole the Green Destiny!

767
01:29:20,857 --> 01:29:23,276
I've done nothing but protect you
and your family.

768
01:29:23,442 --> 01:29:25,945
And you've repaid me
with nothing but contempt.

769
01:29:26,028 --> 01:29:28,906
Li Mubai spared you,
and all you do is insult him.

770
01:29:28,990 --> 01:29:32,410
All we hoped for was a little peace,
and you've ruined it for us!

771
01:29:32,493 --> 01:29:34,579
You're no sister of mine!

772
01:29:36,831 --> 01:29:38,708
What do I care?

773
01:29:39,208 --> 01:29:41,794
You were never a real friend anyway.

774
01:29:41,878 --> 01:29:45,548
But I wonder,
how long could you last as my enemy?

775
01:29:48,301 --> 01:29:50,136
Put the sword down.

776
01:30:00,688 --> 01:30:01,981
Jiaolong!

777
01:30:05,151 --> 01:30:07,445
Everyone out. Shut the doors.

778
01:30:18,539 --> 01:30:20,625
Fine. Not friends. Not sisters.

779
01:33:34,570 --> 01:33:38,656
Don't touch it! That's Li Mubai's sword.

780
01:33:39,949 --> 01:33:42,201
Come and get it if you can.

781
01:33:42,743 --> 01:33:45,913
Without the Green Destiny,
you are nothing.

782
01:33:46,497 --> 01:33:49,625
Don't blame the weapon
if you can't defeat me.

783
01:33:53,129 --> 01:33:55,214
Go ahead. Take your pick.

784
01:33:56,048 --> 01:33:57,174
<i>I'll wait.</i>

785
01:33:59,552 --> 01:34:00,594
Anything you want.

786
01:34:55,816 --> 01:34:57,568
Give me the sword.

787
01:34:59,528 --> 01:35:00,613
Take it!

788
01:35:05,492 --> 01:35:06,660
Stop!

789
01:35:09,955 --> 01:35:11,624
You are not worthy of this sword.

790
01:35:11,874 --> 01:35:14,210
Not another lecture! On guard!

791
01:35:16,629 --> 01:35:20,424
- Stop yourself before I do.
- Only the sword will settle this.

792
01:35:56,043 --> 01:36:00,673
I held back at the monastery
because I wanted to see the real you.

793
01:36:06,262 --> 01:36:09,265
What do you know about seeing
a true heart?

794
01:37:51,116 --> 01:37:54,203
- What is it you want?
- What I have always wanted.

795
01:37:54,286 --> 01:37:55,996
To teach you.

796
01:38:28,612 --> 01:38:31,990
All right. If you can take back the 
sword in three moves

797
01:38:32,991 --> 01:38:35,035
I'll go with you.

798
01:38:39,123 --> 01:38:41,125
- Give it back!
- Bow to your master.

799
01:38:41,208 --> 01:38:43,460
- Never!
- Then you have no use for this sword.

800
01:39:58,952 --> 01:40:02,581
Sooner or later, they'd drag you
back to Beijing.

801
01:40:02,831 --> 01:40:06,627
Your parents value their reputation.
They'll never accept you again.

802
01:40:09,630 --> 01:40:14,218
What good's a home? You've gone so far.
Now we can go all the way together.

803
01:40:14,927 --> 01:40:17,012
You'll always be my Lady.

804
01:40:20,015 --> 01:40:23,936
After all, happiness is the most
important thing in life, isn't it?

805
01:40:24,144 --> 01:40:26,647
We'll be our own masters at last.

806
01:40:27,272 --> 01:40:30,400
All we have left is each other, right?

807
01:40:35,113 --> 01:40:37,032
Now lie down and rest.

808
01:40:59,888 --> 01:41:02,766
Crazy girl like that,
you should have killed her.

809
01:41:02,849 --> 01:41:04,977
I didn't have the heart to do it.

810
01:41:05,102 --> 01:41:07,271
Maybe Li Mubai can do it.

811
01:42:18,133 --> 01:42:20,510
Is it the girl or the sword you want?

812
01:42:40,864 --> 01:42:42,741
You've been drugged.

813
01:43:00,634 --> 01:43:02,344
Where's Jade Fox?

814
01:43:44,845 --> 01:43:46,555
What happened?

815
01:43:47,639 --> 01:43:49,516
Jade Fox drugged her.

816
01:43:50,058 --> 01:43:51,935
How did you get here?

817
01:43:54,104 --> 01:43:55,981
We followed Jade Fox.

818
01:43:58,900 --> 01:44:00,402
Watch out!

819
01:44:10,495 --> 01:44:11,913
Governess!

820
01:44:26,178 --> 01:44:28,138
And so you die.

821
01:44:30,390 --> 01:44:32,142
And so shall you.

822
01:44:40,484 --> 01:44:42,277
A poisoned needle!

823
01:44:45,989 --> 01:44:47,824
You deserve to die

824
01:44:49,576 --> 01:44:51,411
but the life I was trying to take

825
01:44:51,870 --> 01:44:54,289
was Jiaolong's.

826
01:44:56,166 --> 01:44:58,168
Ten years I devoted to you.

827
01:44:58,543 --> 01:45:00,587
But you deceived me!

828
01:45:01,671 --> 01:45:05,258
You hid the book's true meaning.
I never improved

829
01:45:06,676 --> 01:45:10,347
but your progress was limitless.

830
01:45:12,557 --> 01:45:14,559
You know what poison is?

831
01:45:15,310 --> 01:45:18,146
An eight-year-old girl who's full of deceit!

832
01:45:18,647 --> 01:45:20,357
That's poison!

833
01:45:24,361 --> 01:45:25,487
Jiaolong!

834
01:45:27,322 --> 01:45:28,824
My only love,

835
01:45:30,242 --> 01:45:31,743
my only enemy!

836
01:45:41,253 --> 01:45:44,548
You can't die! Tell us,
what poison did you use?

837
01:45:44,756 --> 01:45:46,383
What poison?

838
01:45:46,883 --> 01:45:49,427
You can't die, tell us the antidote!

839
01:45:49,719 --> 01:45:52,430
You can't let him die! Mubai can't die!

840
01:45:52,556 --> 01:45:54,891
- It's the Purple Yin Poison.
- What?

841
01:45:55,767 --> 01:45:59,104
Purple Yin Poison.
It goes straight to the heart.

842
01:46:02,023 --> 01:46:05,569
My blood will stop flowing
within two hours.

843
01:46:07,279 --> 01:46:10,282
It's the same poison that killed my master.

844
01:46:11,950 --> 01:46:15,203
- There's no antidote.
- There must be an antidote!

845
01:46:15,787 --> 01:46:19,457
Every living thing has its antithesis.
Why not this?

846
01:46:20,792 --> 01:46:23,545
There is. Fox taught it to me.

847
01:46:24,045 --> 01:46:28,466
The recipe isn't complicated, but the
ingredients are hard to find. It takes time.

848
01:46:35,473 --> 01:46:37,142
Please, trust me.

849
01:46:37,642 --> 01:46:40,812
As you have helped me, let me help him.

850
01:46:43,481 --> 01:46:45,442
All right. Hurry up.

851
01:46:45,984 --> 01:46:48,236
Maybe I can hold on for two hours.

852
01:46:48,320 --> 01:46:50,906
Ride my horse to headquarters.
They have the ingredients.

853
01:46:50,989 --> 01:46:53,491
Give this to Mrs Wu.
She'll help you. Hurry!

854
01:46:53,950 --> 01:46:57,329
Save your breath.
Guard your energy. I'll be back.

855
01:47:22,938 --> 01:47:24,606
Who is this?

856
01:47:26,900 --> 01:47:29,277
Mrs Wu! Where's Mrs Wu?

857
01:47:29,486 --> 01:47:30,820
Stop it!

858
01:47:32,197 --> 01:47:34,991
Yu gave me this
and told me to come to you.

859
01:47:36,117 --> 01:47:37,827
Let her come in!

860
01:47:51,716 --> 01:47:54,052
Mubai, hold on.

861
01:47:58,556 --> 01:48:00,350
Give me some hope.

862
01:48:25,250 --> 01:48:26,710
Xiulian.

863
01:48:28,253 --> 01:48:30,338
Don't waste your breath.

864
01:48:32,257 --> 01:48:34,217
My life is departing.

865
01:48:36,011 --> 01:48:38,096
I've only one breath left.

866
01:48:40,598 --> 01:48:43,268
Use it to meditate.

867
01:48:43,768 --> 01:48:48,273
Free yourself from this world
as you've been taught.

868
01:48:49,899 --> 01:48:54,070
Let your soul rise to eternity
with your last breath.

869
01:48:56,239 --> 01:48:59,409
Don't waste it on me.

870
01:49:02,871 --> 01:49:05,457
I've already wasted my whole life.

871
01:49:06,791 --> 01:49:09,627
I want to tell you
with my remaining strength

872
01:49:11,463 --> 01:49:13,798
that I love you. I always have.

873
01:49:49,584 --> 01:49:53,505
I would rather be a ghost, 
drifting at your side

874
01:49:54,923 --> 01:49:56,758
as a condemned soul,
than enter heaven without you.

875
01:49:59,511 --> 01:50:02,764
Even if I was banished
to the darkest place,

876
01:50:05,308 --> 01:50:06,518
my love

877
01:50:10,105 --> 01:50:13,983
will keep me from being a lonely spirit.

878
01:51:10,123 --> 01:51:11,583
He's gone?

879
01:51:40,904 --> 01:51:42,447
Yoshi,

880
01:51:43,114 --> 01:51:45,742
please take this sword back to Bei-leye.

881
01:51:52,957 --> 01:51:57,212
You may go to Wudang Mountain.
Xiaohu awaits you there.

882
01:51:58,671 --> 01:52:02,926
Promise me whatever path
you decide to take in this life,

883
01:52:04,093 --> 01:52:05,929
be true to yourself.

884
01:52:53,685 --> 01:52:54,852
Jiaolong!

885
01:53:55,705 --> 01:53:56,789
Jiaolong.

886
01:54:00,460 --> 01:54:03,129
Remember the story
you told me in the desert?

887
01:54:05,423 --> 01:54:08,426
Have faith, then the dreams will come true.

888
01:54:14,640 --> 01:54:16,392
Make a wish, Xiaohu.

889
01:54:18,936 --> 01:54:22,440
To be back be in the desert,
together again.
