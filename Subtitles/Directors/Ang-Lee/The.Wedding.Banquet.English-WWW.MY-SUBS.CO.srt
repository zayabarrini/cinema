responsible for

331
00:18:38,786 --> 00:18:41,756
whatever the fuck apocalyptic
coming out party

332
00:18:41,856 --> 00:18:43,490
you have planned for yourself.

333
00:18:43,591 --> 00:18:44,792
It's too much!

334
00:18:49,196 --> 00:18:50,598
Chris.

335
00:18:51,866 --> 00:18:53,367
I love you.

336
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:57,137
Isn't my proposal...

337
00:18:58,338 --> 00:19:00,708
throwing everything away...

338
00:19:02,744 --> 00:19:04,244
proof of that?

339
00:19:05,113 --> 00:19:06,948
Oh, that's beautiful.

340
00:19:07,048 --> 00:19:09,017
-Babe.
-It's romantic.

341
00:19:09,383 --> 00:19:11,519
There are other ways for you
to stay in the country

342
00:19:11,619 --> 00:19:13,487
while you sort your life out.

343
00:19:13,588 --> 00:19:17,091
You could enroll online at UW
and take a Photoshop class.

344
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:19,393
Or learn Google Sheets.

345
00:19:19,493 --> 00:19:21,361
That'll buy you a year
to figure--

346
00:19:21,461 --> 00:19:23,097
I don't want a year!

347
00:19:23,196 --> 00:19:25,900
I told you, I want a life.

348
00:19:26,266 --> 00:19:29,637
And I'm already so good
at Google Sheets!

349
00:19:32,239 --> 00:19:34,809
You shit-talk me
in front of our friends.

350
00:19:35,143 --> 00:19:37,277
Disrespect our relationship.

351
00:19:39,113 --> 00:19:41,348
As if a stupid green card
is the only thing

352
00:19:41,448 --> 00:19:43,383
I ever wanted from you.

353
00:19:49,157 --> 00:19:50,558
Wait, Min. Hold on.

354
00:19:50,658 --> 00:19:53,628
I only asked you to marry me...

355
00:19:55,395 --> 00:19:57,765
because I thought
you would say yes.

356
00:20:07,108 --> 00:20:10,011
Oh, my God.
You two are the same.

357
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:12,080
Just say something.

358
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,514
Min!

359
00:20:15,183 --> 00:20:16,918
[Chris] Oh, fuck.

360
00:20:17,819 --> 00:20:19,286
I'm sorry.

361
00:20:20,588 --> 00:20:24,125
It's okay.
We knew it would be difficult.

362
00:20:24,491 --> 00:20:26,393
Is Lee gonna try again?

363
00:20:27,061 --> 00:20:28,963
I don't think so.

364
00:20:30,098 --> 00:20:31,364
The expectation.

365
00:20:31,465 --> 00:20:33,233
The disappointment.

366
00:20:34,301 --> 00:20:36,336
It was really hard on her.

367
00:20:38,806 --> 00:20:42,275
You know, she asked me
if I would do it.

368
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:44,912
What? The IVF?

369
00:20:45,713 --> 00:20:47,048
[laughs]

370
00:20:47,148 --> 00:20:49,449
-Weird.
-I know.

371
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:52,019
Lee, I can see pregnant.

372
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,287
Min, I can see pregnant.

373
00:20:54,387 --> 00:20:56,991
But you? [laughs]

374
00:20:57,091 --> 00:20:59,127
I... whatever.

375
00:20:59,227 --> 00:21:02,196
Doesn't matter
if it's Lee or me.

376
00:21:02,295 --> 00:21:04,165
'Cause we don't have the money.

377
00:21:04,264 --> 00:21:05,833
So...

378
00:21:08,703 --> 00:21:10,705
Lee would be such a good mom.

379
00:21:12,707 --> 00:21:14,041
So would you.

380
00:21:17,277 --> 00:21:19,312
You have mother issues.

381
00:21:19,412 --> 00:21:22,083
It's not the same thing
as motherhood issues.

382
00:21:22,183 --> 00:21:24,484
Yeah, it actually is.

383
00:21:28,156 --> 00:21:32,492
So, are you gonna do long
distance with Min in Korea?

384
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,963
Uh... I don't know. I think...

385
00:21:36,329 --> 00:21:38,298
we'll just take it day by day.

386
00:21:38,398 --> 00:21:41,702
You've been taking it
day by day for five years.

387
00:21:41,803 --> 00:21:45,239
Min, birding instead
of finishing your dissertation.

388
00:21:45,338 --> 00:21:47,508
Queer theory takes the joy
out of being gay.

389
00:21:47,608 --> 00:21:49,744
You live in our garage.

390
00:21:49,844 --> 00:21:52,847
Okay, you gotta commit
to something at some point.

391
00:21:58,019 --> 00:21:59,654
God, we're fuckups.

392
00:22:00,822 --> 00:22:01,789
[Chris] Dick's!

393
00:22:01,889 --> 00:22:03,090
[laughing]

394
00:22:03,191 --> 00:22:04,324
[Angela] Dick's!

395
00:22:04,892 --> 00:22:07,228
[as Dracula]
I want to suck your dick.

396
00:22:07,327 --> 00:22:09,030
[laughing]

397
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:10,832
[as Dracula] I want more Dick's.

398
00:22:10,932 --> 00:22:13,267
[laughing]

399
00:22:13,366 --> 00:22:14,434
-Shh.
-Shh!

400
00:22:14,535 --> 00:22:16,771
Shut up. Shut up, you fool.
Shut up.

401
00:22:16,871 --> 00:22:18,806
-Let's do it.
-[snort laughs]

402
00:22:18,906 --> 00:22:21,474
-...teenagers or something.
-I think so too.

403
00:22:21,576 --> 00:22:24,411
Or that we were 50?
I can't tell.

404
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:27,014
-No in-between.
-No in-between.

405
00:22:31,351 --> 00:22:33,888
Do it. I dare you.

406
00:22:33,988 --> 00:22:35,488
Do what?

407
00:22:38,793 --> 00:22:39,894
Mm.

408
00:22:42,029 --> 00:22:44,665
No. Not again.

409
00:22:46,868 --> 00:22:48,368
Will you marry me?

410
00:22:48,468 --> 00:22:50,037
Min, I can't.

411
00:22:50,137 --> 00:22:51,205
Not you.

412
00:22:51,305 --> 00:22:52,840
I don't want to marry you
anymore.

413
00:22:53,541 --> 00:22:54,842
I want to marry her.

414
00:22:54,942 --> 00:22:55,843
Me?

415
00:22:55,943 --> 00:22:56,844
What?

416
00:22:58,746 --> 00:23:01,249
We're friends.
We help each other.

417
00:23:01,349 --> 00:23:02,750
Okay.

418
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:06,921
I heard all about the IVF,
and I'm so, so sad.

419
00:23:07,021 --> 00:23:09,290
But, until my grandfather
takes my money away,

420
00:23:09,389 --> 00:23:11,125
I have so much money.

421
00:23:11,225 --> 00:23:14,562
I want you to have some so you
and Lee can have a family.

422
00:23:15,363 --> 00:23:18,032
So, I have a proposal.

423
00:23:19,166 --> 00:23:23,470
You marry me, and I'll pay
for Lee to grow a baby.

424
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:26,473
You're joking, right?

425
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,910
He's joking, right?

426
00:23:30,278 --> 00:23:32,780
I mean, it's... It's an idea.

427
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,948
A very good one.

428
00:23:34,048 --> 00:23:35,650
No! This is absurd.

429
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:38,451
This is crazier
than you marrying me.

430
00:23:38,552 --> 00:23:40,254
You left me no choice.

431
00:23:40,354 --> 00:23:42,056
Okay, why is he proposing to me?

432
00:23:42,156 --> 00:23:43,357
You marry him.

433
00:23:43,658 --> 00:23:45,826
Hon, my entire career
is being gay.

434
00:23:45,927 --> 00:23:49,096
I don't think we would clear
the green card interview.

435
00:23:49,196 --> 00:23:50,331
I'm gay, too, remember?

436
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:52,366
Yeah, but you work
in a worm lab.

437
00:23:52,465 --> 00:23:54,168
You don't talk to anyone.

438
00:23:54,635 --> 00:23:57,204
I mean, you've been
with dudes before.

439
00:23:57,872 --> 00:23:59,006
[groans]

440
00:23:59,373 --> 00:24:02,510
-Okay, I can't marry him.
-I can't either.

441
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:04,645
Neither of you are marrying
my boyfriend.

442
00:24:04,745 --> 00:24:06,147
So, you do want to marry me?

443
00:24:06,247 --> 00:24:07,114
No!

444
00:24:07,214 --> 00:24:08,749
[sighs]

445
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:12,687
This is all very hard on my ego.

446
00:24:15,623 --> 00:24:17,658
[tender music playing]

447
00:24:17,758 --> 00:24:18,626
[grunts]

448
00:24:21,595 --> 00:24:23,130
I'm still mad.

449
00:24:24,065 --> 00:24:26,667
You look like a ghost.

450
00:24:29,603 --> 00:24:30,938
You're drunk.

451
00:24:33,341 --> 00:24:36,777
A hot, gay ghost.

452
00:24:39,714 --> 00:24:41,148
Are you smiling under there?

453
00:24:41,916 --> 00:24:42,883
Hmm?

454
00:24:48,155 --> 00:24:51,993
Just give me a minute
to figure stuff out.

455
00:24:52,093 --> 00:24:55,930
I will, I promise.
I just need some time.

456
00:25:13,381 --> 00:25:15,583
[Lee] Dad loved this house.

457
00:25:17,218 --> 00:25:19,820
This is what he spent
his life savings on.

458
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:20,955
[chuckles]

459
00:25:28,329 --> 00:25:30,531
When he bought it, he, um...

460
00:25:32,433 --> 00:25:34,301
He said, "Angeline.

461
00:25:34,668 --> 00:25:38,439
"We're keeping Duwamish land
in Duwamish hands.

462
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:43,177
They can burn our longhouses,
but they can't make us leave.

463
00:25:43,277 --> 00:25:44,945
This is ours forever."

464
00:25:50,918 --> 00:25:54,388
And when we moved in, he said
this was gonna be my room.

465
00:25:55,122 --> 00:25:58,759
If I ever had a kid,
it'd be their room someday too.

466
00:26:06,535 --> 00:26:08,135
Well, it's a good room.

467
00:26:09,136 --> 00:26:11,138
-Mm-hmm.
-Yeah.

468
00:26:12,573 --> 00:26:14,341
And it's a good house.

469
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:17,011
Yep.

470
00:26:19,046 --> 00:26:21,348
Good house with a fat mortgage.

471
00:26:25,686 --> 00:26:27,321
It's a home.

472
00:26:31,592 --> 00:26:33,127
Hey, leave it.

473
00:26:33,528 --> 00:26:35,863
What if I took up Min
on his offer?

474
00:26:37,164 --> 00:26:38,432
Come on.

475
00:26:38,533 --> 00:26:40,569
I'm serious. Stop.

476
00:26:40,935 --> 00:26:43,904
Look, I marry Min, he gives us
the money for the IVF.

477
00:26:45,906 --> 00:26:46,907
[scoffs]

478
00:26:47,675 --> 00:26:48,876
Angela.

479
00:26:49,443 --> 00:26:50,911
You're not serious.

480
00:26:51,011 --> 00:26:54,482
Look, I'm a hundred percent
serious.

481
00:26:54,583 --> 00:26:57,184
He wants to help us.
We should help him.

482
00:26:57,485 --> 00:26:58,553
Min needs his green card,

483
00:26:58,652 --> 00:27:00,321
and Chris needs help too.

484
00:27:00,421 --> 00:27:02,857
I mean, he needs time
to sort things out with Min.

485
00:27:04,692 --> 00:27:07,228
-Look, I--
-No, I can't.

486
00:27:07,328 --> 00:27:08,963
I can't ask you to do that.

487
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:13,434
If there's even
a one percent chance

488
00:27:13,535 --> 00:27:15,202
that this could work...

489
00:27:17,938 --> 00:27:20,040
I want you to try again.

490
00:27:28,382 --> 00:27:30,718
[knocking on door]

491
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:37,224
Okay. Yes.

492
00:27:38,125 --> 00:27:40,194
Yes... what?

493
00:27:40,294 --> 00:27:44,131
I'll marry you.
You'll pay for Lee's IVF.

494
