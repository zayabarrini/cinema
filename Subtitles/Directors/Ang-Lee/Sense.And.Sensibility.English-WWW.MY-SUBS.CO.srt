1
00:01:08,832 --> 00:01:11,387
Your son has arrived from London, sir.

2
00:01:15,071 --> 00:01:17,000
Father.

3
00:01:17,107 --> 00:01:18,968
John.

4
00:01:21,211 --> 00:01:24,147
You will find out
soon enough from my will...

5
00:01:24,247 --> 00:01:27,017
that the estate of Norland
was left to me...

6
00:01:27,117 --> 00:01:33,017
in such a way as prevents me from
dividing it between my two families.

7
00:01:33,123 --> 00:01:35,279
Calm yourself, Father.
This cannot be good for you.

8
00:01:35,391 --> 00:01:40,756
Norland in its entirety is, therefore...

9
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:43,157
yours by law...

10
00:01:43,266 --> 00:01:48,324
and I am happy for you and Fanny.

11
00:01:50,907 --> 00:01:52,699
But your stepmother...

12
00:01:53,409 --> 00:01:55,304
my wife and daughters...

13
00:01:55,411 --> 00:01:59,399
are left only £500 a year...
barely enough to live on.

14
00:01:59,682 --> 00:02:01,941
Nothing for the girls' dowries.

15
00:02:04,621 --> 00:02:07,710
You must help them.

16
00:02:08,725 --> 00:02:10,176
Of course.

17
00:02:10,293 --> 00:02:12,313
You must promise to do this.

18
00:02:15,165 --> 00:02:16,923
I promise, Father.

19
00:02:18,268 --> 00:02:20,288
I promise.

20
00:02:21,137 --> 00:02:24,033
Help them?
What do you mean, 'Help them"?

21
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:27,264
Dearest, I mean to give them £3,000.

22
00:02:27,377 --> 00:02:31,848
The interest will provide them
with a little extra income.

23
00:02:31,948 --> 00:02:35,606
Such a gift will certainly discharge
my promise to my father.

24
00:02:35,718 --> 00:02:38,807
Without question. More than amply.

25
00:02:38,922 --> 00:02:42,717
One had rather on such occasions
do too much than too little.

26
00:02:45,662 --> 00:02:48,114
Of course, he did not stipulate
a particular sum.

27
00:02:52,268 --> 00:02:54,925
£1,500 then. What do you say to 1,500?

28
00:02:55,038 --> 00:02:58,765
What brother on earth would do
half so much for his real sisters?

29
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:02,278
- Let alone half-blood?
- They can hardly expect more.

30
00:03:02,378 --> 00:03:06,901
There's no knowing what they expect.
The question is, what can you afford?

31
00:03:10,153 --> 00:03:12,639
A hundred pounds a year to their mother.

32
00:03:12,755 --> 00:03:16,914
Is that more advisable? It is better
than parting with 1,500 all at once.

33
00:03:17,026 --> 00:03:21,048
But if she should live longer than
15 years, we'd be completely taken in.

34
00:03:23,299 --> 00:03:27,196
People always live forever when
there is an annuity to be paid them.

35
00:03:29,706 --> 00:03:32,727
Twenty pounds now and then
will amply discharge my promise.

36
00:03:32,842 --> 00:03:34,703
Indeed.

37
00:03:34,811 --> 00:03:37,366
Although, I am convinced
that your father...

38
00:03:37,647 --> 00:03:40,406
had no idea of your giving them money.

39
00:03:40,683 --> 00:03:42,852
They will have 500 a year as it is.

40
00:03:42,952 --> 00:03:46,178
What on earth could four women
want for more than that?

41
00:03:46,289 --> 00:03:48,047
Their housekeeping will be nothing:

42
00:03:48,157 --> 00:03:52,228
no carriage, no horses, hardly any
servants, and they'll keep no company.

43
00:03:52,328 --> 00:03:54,780
Only conceive how comfortable
they will be.

44
00:03:55,698 --> 00:03:58,628
They will be much more able
to give you something.

45
00:04:21,658 --> 00:04:24,645
Marianne, could you play something else?

46
00:04:24,761 --> 00:04:27,384
Mama has been weeping since breakfast.

47
00:04:37,941 --> 00:04:40,837
I meant something
less mournful, dearest.

48
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:46,305
Reduced to the condition
of visitor in my home.

49
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:49,175
It is not to be borne, Elinor.

50
00:04:50,019 --> 00:04:51,811
We have nowhere to go.

51
00:04:51,921 --> 00:04:54,874
John and Fanny will be descending
from London any moment.

52
00:04:54,991 --> 00:04:57,113
Do you expect me to welcome them?

53
00:04:57,226 --> 00:04:58,848
Vultures.

54
00:05:12,642 --> 00:05:16,061
I will start making inquiries
for a new house at once.

55
00:05:18,247 --> 00:05:21,177
Until then, we must try
to bear their coming.

56
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:27,379
Margaret, are you there?
Please come down.

57
00:05:27,623 --> 00:05:29,745
John and Fanny will be here soon.

58
00:05:32,295 --> 00:05:37,057
Why are they coming to live at Norland?
They already have a house in London.

59
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:42,639
Because houses go from father to son,
dearest, not from father to daughter.

60
00:05:42,739 --> 00:05:44,668
It is the law.

61
00:05:46,042 --> 00:05:48,233
Come inside.
We could play with your atlas.

62
00:05:48,344 --> 00:05:51,763
It's not my atlas anymore.
It's their atlas.

63
00:05:58,654 --> 00:06:00,412
Do sit down.

64
00:06:01,758 --> 00:06:04,586
As you know, we are looking
for a new home.

65
00:06:04,694 --> 00:06:08,591
When we leave, we shall be able
to retain only Thomas and Betsy.

66
00:06:10,099 --> 00:06:13,257
We're very sorry
to have to leave you all...

67
00:06:13,369 --> 00:06:16,857
but we are certain that you will find
the new Mrs. Dashwood...

68
00:06:16,973 --> 00:06:18,868
a fair and generous mistress.

69
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:24,607
My only real concern is how long
it will take them to move out.

70
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:48,928
How is Mrs. Ferrars?

71
00:06:50,373 --> 00:06:52,302
My mother is always in excellent health.

72
00:06:52,408 --> 00:06:54,860
My brother Robert is
with her this season...

73
00:06:54,977 --> 00:06:57,031
and quite the most popular bachelor
in London.

74
00:06:57,146 --> 00:06:58,904
He has his own barouche.

75
00:07:03,786 --> 00:07:05,681
You have two brothers, have you not?

76
00:07:05,788 --> 00:07:09,981
Indeed, yes. Edward is the elder,
and Mama quite depends upon him.

77
00:07:10,093 --> 00:07:13,114
He's travelling from Plymouth shortly
and will break his journey here.

78
00:07:18,968 --> 00:07:21,193
If that is agreeable to you, of course.

79
00:07:22,038 --> 00:07:24,661
My dear John...

80
00:07:24,774 --> 00:07:26,669
this is your home now.

81
00:07:30,713 --> 00:07:34,303
Fanny wishes to know where the key
to the silver cabinet is.

82
00:07:34,417 --> 00:07:37,176
Betsy has it.
What does Fanny want with the silver?

83
00:07:37,286 --> 00:07:40,690
One can only presume
she wants to count it.

84
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:43,811
- What are you doing?
- Presents for the servants.

85
00:07:43,926 --> 00:07:46,014
Have you seen Margaret, by the way?

86
00:07:46,129 --> 00:07:49,184
I'm worried about her.
She's taken to hiding in odd places.

87
00:07:49,298 --> 00:07:53,195
Fortunate girl. At least she can escape
Fanny, which is more than we're able.

88
00:07:53,302 --> 00:07:56,198
You do your best.
You've not said a word to her.

89
00:07:56,305 --> 00:07:57,807
I have.

90
00:07:57,907 --> 00:07:59,836
I've said "yes" and "no."

91
00:08:14,157 --> 00:08:16,052
Good morning, Fanny.

92
00:08:18,794 --> 00:08:21,349
Good morning, Miss Marianne.

93
00:08:21,631 --> 00:08:25,028
How did you find the silver?
Was it all genuine?

94
00:08:25,134 --> 00:08:29,906
Pray, when may we expect the pleasure
of your brother's company?

95
00:08:30,006 --> 00:08:32,197
Edward is due tomorrow.

96
00:08:32,308 --> 00:08:36,365
My dear Mrs. Dashwood, in view of the
fact that he will not be with us long...

97
00:08:36,646 --> 00:08:40,149
would Miss Margaret be prepared
to give up her room for him?

98
00:08:40,249 --> 00:08:42,735
The view is quite incomparable
from her windows.

99
00:08:42,852 --> 00:08:45,782
I should so much like Edward
to see Norland at its best.

100
00:09:08,678 --> 00:09:13,099
Mrs. Dashwood, Miss Dashwood,
Miss Marianne...

101
00:09:13,216 --> 00:09:15,202
my brother Edward Ferrars.

102
00:09:17,286 --> 00:09:18,771
Do sit down.

103
00:09:22,792 --> 00:09:24,694
But where is Miss Margaret?

104
00:09:24,794 --> 00:09:28,589
I declare, I'm beginning to doubt
her existence. She must run wild.

105
00:09:28,698 --> 00:09:31,992
Pray forgive us, Mr. Ferrars.
My youngest is not to be found.

106
00:09:32,101 --> 00:09:34,724
She's a little shy
of strangers at present.

107
00:09:35,838 --> 00:09:37,573
Well, naturally.

108
00:09:37,673 --> 00:09:41,570
I'm shy of strangers myself,
and I have nothing like her excuse.

109
00:09:43,145 --> 00:09:45,370
How do you like your view?

110
00:09:48,251 --> 00:09:50,612
Very much.

111
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,912
Your stables are very handsome
and beautifully kept.

112
00:09:54,023 --> 00:09:57,693
Stables? Edward, your windows
overlook the lake.

113
00:09:57,793 --> 00:10:01,747
An oversight, Fanny, had led me
to one of the family rooms...

114
00:10:01,864 --> 00:10:06,319
but I've rectified the situation and am
happily installed in the guest quarters.

115
00:10:09,038 --> 00:10:10,660
Tea.

116
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:15,069
They're all exceedingly spoiled, I find.

117
00:10:15,177 --> 00:10:18,938
Miss Margaret spends all her time
up trees and under furniture.

118
00:10:19,048 --> 00:10:21,705
I've barely had a civil word
from Marianne.

119
00:10:22,918 --> 00:10:26,007
My dear Fanny,
they've just lost their father.

120
00:10:26,122 --> 00:10:28,415
Their lives will never
be the same again.

121
00:10:29,792 --> 00:10:31,687
That is no excuse.

122
00:10:35,665 --> 00:10:37,685
Library.

123
00:10:40,936 --> 00:10:42,990
These are mostly foreign.

124
00:10:43,806 --> 00:10:46,327
Indeed? Magnificent.

125
00:10:46,442 --> 00:10:48,667
I've never liked the smell of books.

126
00:10:48,778 --> 00:10:50,346
Well...

127
00:10:50,446 --> 00:10:52,739
No, it is the dust perhaps.

128
00:10:54,116 --> 00:10:56,307
I hear you have plans
for the walnut grove.

129
00:10:56,419 --> 00:11:01,079
Oh, yes. I shall have it knocked down
to make way for a Grecian temple.

130
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:05,087
Mm. That does sound extremely
interesting. Would you show me the site?

131
00:11:12,768 --> 00:11:15,027
Too expensive.

132
00:11:15,137 --> 00:11:17,692
We do not need four bedrooms.
We can share.

133
00:11:19,241 --> 00:11:20,726
This one, then.

134
00:11:21,711 --> 00:11:25,314
We have only £500 a year.

135
00:11:25,414 --> 00:11:27,809
I will send out more inquiries today.

136
00:11:32,755 --> 00:11:35,412
Pardon my intrusion...

137
00:11:35,691 --> 00:11:38,883
but I think I may have found
what you're looking for.

138
00:11:48,938 --> 00:11:51,197
Won't you come out, dearest?

139
00:11:51,307 --> 00:11:53,202
We haven't seen you all day.

140
00:11:53,309 --> 00:11:57,104
So later, of course,
we shall have to enlarge it.

141
00:11:57,213 --> 00:12:00,268
Mattocks will help you
adjust to our hours.

142
00:12:02,985 --> 00:12:04,846
Oh, Miss Dashwood.

143
00:12:06,222 --> 00:12:10,813
Forgive me. Do you, by any chance,
have a reliable atlas?

144
00:12:10,926 --> 00:12:13,913
- I believe so.
- Excellent.

145
00:12:14,029 --> 00:12:17,187
I wish to check the position
of the Nile.

146
00:12:17,299 --> 00:12:20,058
My sister tells me it is
in South America.

147
00:12:26,242 --> 00:12:28,797
She's quite wrong.

148
00:12:28,911 --> 00:12:31,602
I believe it is in Belgium.

149
00:12:31,714 --> 00:12:33,165
Belgium?

150
00:12:33,282 --> 00:12:36,406
Surely not. I think you must
be thinking of the Volga.

151
00:12:36,685 --> 00:12:39,308
- The Volga?
- Of course. The Volga...

152
00:12:39,422 --> 00:12:41,317
which, as you know, starts in...

153
00:12:41,424 --> 00:12:43,376
- Vladivostok and in...
- Wimbledon.

154
00:12:43,659 --> 00:12:46,020
Precisely.
Where the coffee beans come from.

155
00:12:47,196 --> 00:12:49,955
The source of the Nile is in Abyssinia.

156
00:12:51,834 --> 00:12:53,285
Is it?

157
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:56,826
How interesting. How do you do?

158
00:12:59,241 --> 00:13:01,777
Delighted to make your acquaintance.

159
00:13:01,877 --> 00:13:04,068
- It adjoins this property.
- Quite so.

160
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:07,133
It cannot be but
a most desirable addition.

161
00:13:07,249 --> 00:13:10,577
I will ride there tomorrow
and speak to... Who is it?

162
00:13:10,686 --> 00:13:12,855
Gibson.

163
00:13:12,955 --> 00:13:15,043
He ought to be pleased enough to sell.

164
00:13:15,157 --> 00:13:19,077
He will certainly ask for more than
it is worth. Do not be too eager.

165
00:13:19,195 --> 00:13:21,317
No. You're quite right.

166
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:24,622
We have no desire to lose it
to somebody else.

167
00:13:24,733 --> 00:13:26,685
I'll go tomorrow as planned.

168
00:13:26,802 --> 00:13:29,163
Merely inquire.

169
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:34,232
After all, there'll be
few enough offers.

170
00:13:34,343 --> 00:13:36,966
- The land thereabout is marshy.
- Lunge.

171
00:13:40,249 --> 00:13:43,873
It's possible we may get
some assistance from Mama.

172
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:50,853
Did I hurt you?

173
00:14:55,024 --> 00:14:57,078
Thank you. Forgive me.

174
00:14:59,261 --> 00:15:01,087
That was my father's favourite.

175
00:15:06,135 --> 00:15:08,571
Thank you so much for your help
with Margaret.

176
00:15:08,671 --> 00:15:11,123
She's quite changed since you came.

177
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,295
Not at all. I enjoy her company.

178
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:17,340
- Has she shown you the tree house?
- Not yet.

179
00:15:18,881 --> 00:15:20,571
Would...

180
00:15:20,683 --> 00:15:22,578
Would you do me the honour?

181
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,815
It is very fine out.

182
00:15:26,922 --> 00:15:28,851
With pleasure.

183
00:15:30,392 --> 00:15:32,844
Margaret has always wanted to travel.

184
00:15:32,962 --> 00:15:35,756
I know. She's heading
an expedition to China shortly.

185
00:15:35,864 --> 00:15:39,056
I am to go as her servant,
but only on the understanding...

186
00:15:39,168 --> 00:15:41,063
that I will be very badly treated.

187
00:15:42,071 --> 00:15:44,193
What will your duties be?

188
00:15:44,306 --> 00:15:48,795
Sword fighting, obviously,
administering rum and swabbing.

189
00:15:48,911 --> 00:15:51,602
Which of those duties
will take precedence for you?

190
00:15:51,714 --> 00:15:53,609
Swabbing, I would imagine.

191
00:16:00,856 --> 00:16:04,753
All I want... All I have ever wanted...
is the quiet of a private life...

192
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:07,847
but my mother is determined
to see me distinguished.

193
00:16:07,963 --> 00:16:09,824
- As?
- Anything.

194
00:16:11,367 --> 00:16:14,855
A great orator, a leading politician.
A barrister would serve...

195
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:18,367
as long as I drove a barouche
and dined in the first circles.

196
00:16:18,641 --> 00:16:20,365
What do you wish for?

197
00:16:21,977 --> 00:16:24,168
I've always preferred the Church...

198
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:26,606
but that is not smart enough for Mother.

199
00:16:26,715 --> 00:16:31,204
She prefers the army, but that is
a great deal too smart for me.

200
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:34,307
- Would you stay in London?
- I hate London.

201
00:16:34,423 --> 00:16:37,376
No peace. Country living is my ideal...

202
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:40,920
a small parish
where I might do some good...

203
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:44,154
keep chickens, give very short sermons.

204
00:16:49,838 --> 00:16:52,775
You talk of feeling idle and useless.

205
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:55,862
Imagine how that is compounded
when one has no hope...

206
00:16:55,978 --> 00:16:59,204
and no choice
of any occupation whatsoever.

207
00:17:01,283 --> 00:17:04,179
Our circumstances are,
therefore, precisely the same.

208
00:17:05,921 --> 00:17:08,214
Except that you will inherit
your fortune.

209
00:17:11,193 --> 00:17:13,088
We cannot even earn ours.

210
00:17:15,664 --> 00:17:18,093
- Perhaps Margaret is right.
- Right?

211
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,095
Piracy is our only option.

212
00:17:23,338 --> 00:17:25,267
What is swabbing exactly?

213
00:17:27,643 --> 00:17:31,370
"No voice divine the storm allayed,
no light propitious shone.

214
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:36,204
When snatched from all effectual aid,
we perished... perished, each alone.

215
00:17:37,419 --> 00:17:42,079
But I beneath a rougher sea
and whelmed in deeper gulfs than he."

216
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:44,610
No, Edward, listen.

217
00:17:44,727 --> 00:17:49,785
"No voice divine the storm allayed,
no light propitious shone.

218
00:17:49,898 --> 00:17:54,762
When snatched from all effectual aid,
we perished, each alone."

219
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:56,958
Can you not feel his despair?

220
00:17:58,373 --> 00:17:59,824
Try again.

221
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,669
"No voice divine the storm allayed...

222
00:18:08,717 --> 00:18:11,120
no light propitious shone.

223
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:14,173
When snatched from all effectual aid...

224
00:18:14,289 --> 00:18:17,014
we perished, each alone."

225
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:27,319
Look. This has just arrived.

226
00:18:29,838 --> 00:18:33,030
"I should be pleased to offer you
a home at Barton Cottage...

227
00:18:33,142 --> 00:18:35,037
as soon as you have need."

228
00:18:35,144 --> 00:18:37,232
It's from my cousin, Sir John Middleton.

229
00:18:37,346 --> 00:18:39,673
Even Elinor must approve the rent.

230
00:18:39,782 --> 00:18:41,802
Has Elinor not yet seen this?

231
00:18:41,917 --> 00:18:44,142
- I will fetch her.
- Wait. No.

232
00:18:44,253 --> 00:18:45,909
Let us delay.

233
00:18:46,021 --> 00:18:47,381
Why?

234
00:18:47,623 --> 00:18:50,815
I think... I believe...

235
00:18:50,926 --> 00:18:53,754
that Edward and Elinor
have formed an attachment.

236
00:18:53,862 --> 00:18:57,782
It would be cruel to take her away
so soon. Devonshire is so far.

237
00:18:59,101 --> 00:19:02,190
Why so grave? You disapprove her choice?

238
00:19:02,304 --> 00:19:04,740
By no means.

239
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,632
Edward is very amiable.

240
00:19:06,742 --> 00:19:08,728
Amiable? But?

241
00:19:09,845 --> 00:19:12,172
But there is something wanting.

242
00:19:12,281 --> 00:19:15,177
He's too sedate. His reading last night.

243
00:19:15,284 --> 00:19:18,942
Elinor has not your feelings.
His reserve suits her.

244
00:19:19,054 --> 00:19:20,880
Can he love her?

245
00:19:20,989 --> 00:19:25,580
Can the soul really be satisfied
with such polite affections?

246
00:19:25,694 --> 00:19:27,863
To love is to burn, to be on fire...

247
00:19:27,963 --> 00:19:30,620
Like Juliet or Guinevere or Eloise.

248
00:19:30,732 --> 00:19:32,627
They met rather pathetic ends.

249
00:19:32,734 --> 00:19:37,894
Pathetic? To die for love? How can you
say so? What could be more glorious?

250
00:19:38,006 --> 00:19:41,698
That may be taking your
romantic sensibilities a little far.

251
00:19:48,183 --> 00:19:51,705
"Is love a fancy or a feeling?

252
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:55,740
No. It is immortal as immaculate truth.

253
00:19:55,858 --> 00:19:59,949
It is not a blossom shed as soon
as youth drops from the stem of life...

254
00:20:00,062 --> 00:20:03,390
for it will grow in barren regions
where no waters flow...

255
00:20:03,665 --> 00:20:06,720
nor ray of promise
cheats the pensive gloom."

256
00:20:10,272 --> 00:20:12,775
What a pity Edward
has no passion for reading.

257
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:16,067
You asked him to read,
and then you made him nervous.

258
00:20:16,178 --> 00:20:18,073
- Me?
- Yes.

259
00:20:19,815 --> 00:20:22,718
Since your behaviour to him
is perfectly cordial...

260
00:20:22,818 --> 00:20:26,806
I must assume that you like him
in spite of his deficiencies.

261
00:20:26,922 --> 00:20:28,851
I think him...

262
00:20:28,957 --> 00:20:32,752
everything that is amiable and worthy.

263
00:20:34,096 --> 00:20:36,787
Praise indeed.

264
00:20:36,899 --> 00:20:42,137
But he shall have my unswerving devotion
when you tell me he is to be my brother.

265
00:20:42,237 --> 00:20:45,099
How shall I do without you?

266
00:20:45,207 --> 00:20:49,264
- Do without me?
- I'm sure you will be very happy.

267
00:20:49,378 --> 00:20:51,346
You must not live too far away.

268
00:20:51,446 --> 00:20:54,843
There is no question of...
That is, there is...

269
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:57,175
There is no understanding.

270
00:20:57,286 --> 00:20:59,181
Do you love him?

271
00:21:02,257 --> 00:21:06,382
I do not attempt to deny
that I think very highly of him...

272
00:21:06,628 --> 00:21:08,079
that I...

273
00:21:09,731 --> 00:21:11,819
greatly esteem him.

274
00:21:13,201 --> 00:21:16,723
- I like him.
- "Esteem him"? "Like him"?

275
00:21:16,838 --> 00:21:19,597
Use those words again,
and I shall leave this instant.

276
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:21,933
Very well. Forgive me.

277
00:21:22,044 --> 00:21:24,646
Believe my feelings to be stronger
than I have declared...

278
00:21:24,746 --> 00:21:27,073
but further than that
you must not believe.

279
00:21:29,818 --> 00:21:32,009
Is love a fancy or a feeling?

280
00:21:32,955 --> 00:21:34,713
Or a Ferrars?

281
00:21:34,823 --> 00:21:36,251
Go to bed.

282
00:21:38,327 --> 00:21:40,722
"I do not attempt to deny...

283
00:21:40,829 --> 00:21:42,815
that I think very highly of him...

284
00:21:43,832 --> 00:21:47,661
that I greatly esteem him...

285
00:21:49,805 --> 00:21:51,700
that I like him."

286
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:16,090
We're so happy that you chose
to invite Edward to Norland.

287
00:22:16,198 --> 00:22:19,720
He's a dear boy.
We're all very fond of him.

288
00:22:19,835 --> 00:22:21,787
We have great hopes for him.

289
00:22:21,903 --> 00:22:24,958
Our mother expects much
with regard to his profession.

290
00:22:25,073 --> 00:22:27,935
- Naturally.
- And in marriage.

291
00:22:28,043 --> 00:22:30,905
She's determined both
he and Robert will marry well.

292
00:22:31,013 --> 00:22:32,737
Of course...

293
00:22:32,848 --> 00:22:35,744
but I hope she desires them
to marry for love.

294
00:22:37,019 --> 00:22:39,278
Love is all very well...

295
00:22:39,388 --> 00:22:41,715
but we cannot
always rely on the heart...

296
00:22:41,823 --> 00:22:44,116
to lead us
in the most suitable direction.

297
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,262
You see, my dear Mrs. Dashwood...

298
00:22:47,362 --> 00:22:50,121
Edward is entirely the kind
of compassionate person...

299
00:22:50,232 --> 00:22:52,821
upon whom penniless women can prey.

300
00:22:52,934 --> 00:22:55,386
And having entered
into any understanding...

301
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:57,690
he would never go back on his word.

302
00:22:57,806 --> 00:23:00,201
He's simply incapable of doing so.

303
00:23:00,308 --> 00:23:02,601
But it would lead to his ruin.

304
00:23:03,879 --> 00:23:05,637
I worry for him so.

305
00:23:05,747 --> 00:23:08,973
My mother has made it plain that she'll
withdraw Edward's financial support...

306
00:23:09,084 --> 00:23:14,745
should he choose to plant his affections
in less exalted ground than he deserves.

307
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:20,080
I understand you perfectly.

308
00:23:25,901 --> 00:23:27,352
To Devonshire?

309
00:23:27,636 --> 00:23:31,158
My cousin, Sir John Middleton,
has offered us a house on his estate.

310
00:23:31,273 --> 00:23:33,225
Sir John Middleton?

311
00:23:33,341 --> 00:23:36,601
What is his situation?
He must be a man of some property.

312
00:23:36,711 --> 00:23:39,903
He's a widower. He lives with
his mother-in-law at Barton Park.

313
00:23:40,015 --> 00:23:42,069
It is Barton Cottage he offers.

314
00:23:42,184 --> 00:23:46,138
A cottage. How charming.
A little cottage is always very snug.

315
00:23:47,189 --> 00:23:51,280
But you will not leave
before the summer?

316
00:23:51,393 --> 00:23:56,815
We can no longer trespass upon your
sister's goodwill. We must leave soon.

317
00:23:56,932 --> 00:23:58,918
You will come and stay with us, Edward?

318
00:23:59,034 --> 00:24:00,895
I should like that very much.

319
00:24:01,002 --> 00:24:04,262
Edward has long been expected
in town by our mother.

320
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:06,932
Come as soon as you can.

321
00:24:07,909 --> 00:24:09,929
Remember, you're always welcome.

322
00:24:37,172 --> 00:24:39,067
Cannot you take him with you?

323
00:24:39,174 --> 00:24:41,069
We cannot possibly afford him.

324
00:24:43,411 --> 00:24:46,637
Perhaps he could make himself useful
in the kitchen.

325
00:24:47,782 --> 00:24:49,370
Forgive me.

326
00:24:53,054 --> 00:24:54,812
Miss Dashwood...

327
00:24:57,759 --> 00:24:59,210
Elinor...

328
00:25:00,729 --> 00:25:02,624
I must speak to you.

329
00:25:07,202 --> 00:25:11,099
There is something of great importance
that I need to...

330
00:25:12,941 --> 00:25:14,893
tell you...

331
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:18,338
about my education.

332
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:23,706
Your education?

333
00:25:23,818 --> 00:25:25,940
Yes.

334
00:25:26,054 --> 00:25:28,779
It was conducted...

335
00:25:29,925 --> 00:25:32,081
oddly enough, in Plymouth.

336
00:25:33,261 --> 00:25:35,918
- Indeed?
- Yes. Do you know it?

337
00:25:36,031 --> 00:25:37,926
Plymouth? No.

338
00:25:39,668 --> 00:25:41,688
Well...

339
00:25:41,803 --> 00:25:44,096
I was four years there...

340
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:47,797
in a school run by Mr. Pratt.

341
00:25:53,315 --> 00:25:55,335
Precisely. Yes. Pratt.

342
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:57,811
And...

343
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:00,007
while I was there...

344
00:26:00,922 --> 00:26:02,858
That is to say, he had a...

345
00:26:02,958 --> 00:26:05,217
has a...

346
00:26:07,896 --> 00:26:12,089
I've looked all over for you.
You're needed in London this instant.

347
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:15,722
- I'm leaving this afternoon.
- That will not do. Mama is adamant.

348
00:26:15,837 --> 00:26:17,766
You should leave at once.

349
00:26:21,076 --> 00:26:22,698
Excuse me.

350
00:26:55,176 --> 00:26:59,096
- Edward promised he'd bring the atlas.
- Did he?

351
00:27:00,982 --> 00:27:04,709
I'll wager he will do so
in less than a fortnight.

352
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,876
Dear Edward.

353
00:27:28,877 --> 00:27:32,296
Hello there, now. Welcome. Welcome.

354
00:27:32,414 --> 00:27:34,343
You poor creatures.

355
00:27:34,616 --> 00:27:36,909
There. Do you see? Just as I told you.

356
00:27:38,353 --> 00:27:40,976
- Sir John.
- Oh, how very kind.

357
00:27:48,963 --> 00:27:50,915
Dear ladies.

358
00:27:51,032 --> 00:27:54,269
Upon my word. Here ye are.

359
00:27:54,369 --> 00:27:57,822
Oh, Sir John,
your extraordinary kindness...

360
00:27:57,939 --> 00:28:00,300
No, none of that. Please. None of that.

361
00:28:00,408 --> 00:28:04,533
Here is my dear mama-in-law,
Mrs. Jennings.

362
00:28:04,646 --> 00:28:08,099
- Now get down, you dogs.
- This must be Miss Dashwood.

363
00:28:08,216 --> 00:28:10,737
Was your journey tolerable?
You poor souls.

364
00:28:10,852 --> 00:28:14,214
Why did you not come up
to the park first?

365
00:28:14,322 --> 00:28:17,946
- We saw you pass.
- I could not wait for you to come.

366
00:28:18,059 --> 00:28:21,863
- I made John call the carriage.
- Get down, dogs. She would not wait.

367
00:28:21,963 --> 00:28:24,324
We get so little company!

368
00:28:24,599 --> 00:28:27,256
I feel as if I know you already.

369
00:28:27,369 --> 00:28:30,272
- Delightful creatures.
- Are they not?

370
00:28:30,372 --> 00:28:33,860
And you know you must dine
at Barton Park every day.

371
00:28:33,975 --> 00:28:37,133
- Oh, Sir John, I cannot possibly...
- No, no, no.

372
00:28:37,245 --> 00:28:41,870
I would not brook refusals.
I'm quite deaf to them, you know.

373
00:28:41,983 --> 00:28:46,210
- I insist.
- Let us only settle in for two days.

374
00:28:46,321 --> 00:28:49,911
No, no, no, thanks. I beg you.

375
00:28:50,024 --> 00:28:51,919
I cannot bear it. Couldn't bear it.

376
00:28:56,231 --> 00:28:57,899
I declare.

377
00:28:57,999 --> 00:29:01,259
They are the loveliest girls
I ever set eyes on.

378
00:29:01,369 --> 00:29:05,096
Can you not get them married?
You must not leave it any longer.

379
00:29:05,206 --> 00:29:07,897
There are no young men hereabout
to woo them.

380
00:29:08,009 --> 00:29:09,801
Not a beau for miles.

381
00:29:09,911 --> 00:29:12,272
Come, Mama. Let us leave them in peace.

382
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:16,300
And send your man up to us for
the carriage as soon as you're ready.

383
00:29:16,584 --> 00:29:18,342
- Good-bye.
- Thank you.

384
00:29:18,586 --> 00:29:20,276
No, don't thank us.

385
00:29:20,388 --> 00:29:23,284
Good day to you. Don't thank us.

386
00:29:23,391 --> 00:29:25,786
Come on, boy. Come on, boy. Come on.

387
00:29:41,309 --> 00:29:43,204
Your feet are cold.

388
00:30:09,704 --> 00:30:13,624
What have you been doing? Your neck is
so dirty you could grow a potato on it.

389
00:30:14,409 --> 00:30:16,838
It's cold. I'm cold.

390
00:30:18,179 --> 00:30:20,165
- Hot.
- Thank you.

391
00:30:21,683 --> 00:30:23,134
Hot.

392
00:30:24,052 --> 00:30:26,641
How do you manage it?

393
00:30:28,656 --> 00:30:30,642
Where can Brandon be?

394
00:30:30,758 --> 00:30:33,094
Poor fellow. I hope he's not
lamed his horse.

395
00:30:33,194 --> 00:30:37,023
Colonel Brandon is the most
eligible bachelor in the county.

396
00:30:37,131 --> 00:30:39,652
- Yes, indeed.
- He's bound to do for one of you.

397
00:30:40,368 --> 00:30:43,230
Mind, I think he's a better age
for Miss Dashwood.

398
00:30:44,672 --> 00:30:48,296
But I dare say, she's left
her heart behind in Sussex, hmm?

399
00:30:50,011 --> 00:30:54,807
I see you, Miss Marianne.
I think I've unearthed a secret.

400
00:30:54,916 --> 00:30:57,846
You've sniffed one out already.
You're worse than my best pointer.

401
00:31:00,488 --> 00:31:02,041
What sort of man?

402
00:31:02,156 --> 00:31:05,211
Butcher, baker, candlestick maker?

403
00:31:05,326 --> 00:31:08,984
- I shall winkle it out of you.
- She's horribly good at winkling.

404
00:31:09,097 --> 00:31:13,222
You're in lonely country now.
We none of us have any secrets here.

405
00:31:13,334 --> 00:31:15,263
If we do, we do not keep them long.

406
00:31:18,373 --> 00:31:20,029
He's curate of the parish.

407
00:31:20,141 --> 00:31:22,662
Or perhaps a handsome lieutenant.

408
00:31:22,777 --> 00:31:25,764
Give us a clue. Is he in uniform?

409
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:28,002
He has no profession.

410
00:31:28,116 --> 00:31:31,410
No profession? He's a gentleman, then?

411
00:31:33,087 --> 00:31:35,915
You know perfectly well
there is no such person.

412
00:31:36,024 --> 00:31:39,216
There is, and his name begins with an F.

413
00:31:40,828 --> 00:31:44,156
An F, indeed.
Now there's a promising letter.

414
00:31:44,265 --> 00:31:46,319
F... F... Foster:

415
00:31:46,434 --> 00:31:48,056
- Here's one.
- Forrest.

416
00:31:48,169 --> 00:31:50,189
- Yes.
- Fotheringay. Foggarty.

417
00:31:50,305 --> 00:31:53,861
- Oh, yes. I... I... Fortescue.
- Fondant.

418
00:31:55,276 --> 00:31:59,765
Sir John, might I play your pianoforte?

419
00:32:00,915 --> 00:32:02,605
Yes, of course.

420
00:32:02,717 --> 00:32:04,236
My goodness.

421
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:07,942
Yes, we do not stand
upon ceremony here, my dear.

422
00:32:08,056 --> 00:32:11,646
- Please forgive her.
- An entertainment. I declare.

423
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:14,883
I cannot remember when
we last had a songbird here.

424
00:32:22,971 --> 00:32:26,299
That now lies sleeping

425
00:32:26,407 --> 00:32:29,667
Softly, softly

426
00:32:29,777 --> 00:32:32,798
Now softly

427
00:32:32,914 --> 00:32:38,677
Softly lies sleeping

428
00:32:39,454 --> 00:32:42,179
Sleep

429
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:45,652
Is a reconciling

430
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:51,057
A rest that peace begets

431
00:32:51,165 --> 00:32:54,357
Doth not the sun

432
00:32:54,469 --> 00:32:55,988
Rise smiling

433
00:32:56,104 --> 00:33:00,942
When fair at even he sets

434
00:33:01,042 --> 00:33:04,564
Rest you then

435
00:33:04,679 --> 00:33:07,768
Rest, sad eyes

436
00:33:07,882 --> 00:33:11,074
Melt not in weeping

437
00:33:11,185 --> 00:33:14,343
While she lies sleeping

438
00:33:14,622 --> 00:33:17,711
Softly, softly

439
00:33:17,825 --> 00:33:21,017
Now softly

440
00:33:21,129 --> 00:33:27,051
Softly lies sleeping

441
00:33:33,875 --> 00:33:37,203
Wasn't that love...
Brandon, where have you been?

442
00:33:37,311 --> 00:33:40,036
Come and meet
our beautiful new neighbours.

443
00:33:40,148 --> 00:33:43,601
What a pity you're late, Colonel.
You have not heard...

444
00:33:43,718 --> 00:33:46,307
our delightful songbird, Miss Marianne.

445
00:33:46,421 --> 00:33:48,873
A great pity, indeed.

446
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:52,114
May I present my dear friend
Colonel Brandon?

447
00:33:52,226 --> 00:33:57,022
We served in the East Indies together.
There's no better fellow in the world.

448
00:33:57,131 --> 00:33:59,267
Have you really been to the East Indies?

449
00:33:59,367 --> 00:34:01,819
- I have.
- What's it like?

450
00:34:01,936 --> 00:34:03,956
Like? Hot.

451
00:34:04,072 --> 00:34:09,630
- The air is full of spices.
- How lovely.

452
00:34:09,744 --> 00:34:13,197
Now it's your turn to entertain us.

453
00:34:13,314 --> 00:34:15,334
- Oh, Sir John, I don't...
- And I believe...

454
00:34:15,616 --> 00:34:18,876
I know what key you will sing in.

455
00:34:19,721 --> 00:34:21,172
F major.

456
00:34:35,636 --> 00:34:38,773
As for you, you have no right
to parade your assumptions...

457
00:34:38,873 --> 00:34:41,166
They're not assumptions. You told me.

458
00:34:42,844 --> 00:34:44,796
I told you nothing.

459
00:34:44,912 --> 00:34:46,807
I'll meet him when he comes.

460
00:34:46,914 --> 00:34:50,311
That's not the point. You don't speak
of such things before strangers.

461
00:34:50,418 --> 00:34:54,188
- But everyone else was.
- Mrs. Jennings is not everyone.

462
00:34:54,288 --> 00:34:57,412
I like her. She talks about things.

463
00:34:57,658 --> 00:35:00,747
- We never talk about things.
- Hush. Please.

464
00:35:00,862 --> 00:35:04,020
That is enough. If you cannot
think of anything appropriate...

465
00:35:04,132 --> 00:35:07,290
you will please restrict
your remarks to the weather.

466
00:35:11,405 --> 00:35:14,563
Surely they've got enough reeds
for Moses's basket by now.

467
00:35:14,675 --> 00:35:16,103
We've got lots.

468
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:21,075
Wrap your string around it.

469
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:24,145
I know it's tight.

470
00:35:53,147 --> 00:35:55,406
You know what they're saying, of course.

471
00:35:57,685 --> 00:36:01,207
Word is, you've developed
a taste for certain company.

472
00:36:01,322 --> 00:36:05,344
And why not?
A man like you in his prime.

473
00:36:05,593 --> 00:36:08,546
She'd be a very fortunate young lady.

474
00:36:08,663 --> 00:36:12,219
Marianne Dashwood would no more think
of me than she would of you.

475
00:36:12,333 --> 00:36:15,236
Brandon, my boy, do not think
of yourself so meanly.

476
00:36:15,336 --> 00:36:17,561
And all the better for her.

477
00:36:33,855 --> 00:36:35,374
Very good.

478
00:36:45,967 --> 00:36:50,104
Besotted. An excellent match.

479
00:36:50,204 --> 00:36:52,292
For he's rich, and she's handsome.

480
00:36:53,374 --> 00:36:55,303
How long have you known the colonel?

481
00:36:55,409 --> 00:37:00,535
Lord bless you. As long as ever I've
been here, and I came 15 years back.

482
00:37:00,648 --> 00:37:05,546
His estate at Delaford is but four miles
hence, and he and John are very thick.

483
00:37:05,653 --> 00:37:10,779
He has no wife and children,
for he had a tragic history.

484
00:37:11,759 --> 00:37:14,746
He loved a girl once.
Twenty years ago now.

485
00:37:14,862 --> 00:37:17,865
A ward to his family,
but they were not permitted to marry.

486
00:37:17,965 --> 00:37:21,555
- On what grounds?
- Money. Eliza was poor.

487
00:37:21,669 --> 00:37:23,860
When the father
discovered their amour...

488
00:37:23,971 --> 00:37:27,231
she was flung out of the house
and he was packed up into the army.

489
00:37:27,341 --> 00:37:30,271
I think he would've done himself
a harm if not for John.

490
00:37:31,913 --> 00:37:34,308
What became of the lady?

491
00:37:34,415 --> 00:37:37,607
She was passed from man to man.

492
00:37:37,718 --> 00:37:39,738
Disappeared from all good society.

493
00:37:40,922 --> 00:37:44,876
When Brandon came back from India,
he searched heaven knows how long...

494
00:37:44,992 --> 00:37:48,286
only to find her dying in a poorhouse.

495
00:37:48,396 --> 00:37:52,020
Once, I thought my daughter Charlotte
might've cheered him up...

496
00:37:52,133 --> 00:37:54,858
but she's better off where she is.

497
00:37:54,969 --> 00:37:57,626
But look at him now.

498
00:37:57,738 --> 00:37:59,326
So attentive.

499
00:38:02,576 --> 00:38:04,732
I think I shall try
an experiment on him.

500
00:38:04,845 --> 00:38:07,798
No, Mrs. Jennings, please.
Leave the poor colonel alone.

501
00:38:07,915 --> 00:38:11,778
No, my dear, it's just a thing.
All suitors need a little help.

502
00:38:12,887 --> 00:38:16,750
Colonel Brandon, we have not heard
you play for us of late.

503
00:38:16,857 --> 00:38:20,185
For the simple reason that you have
a far superior musician here.

504
00:38:20,294 --> 00:38:24,555
Perhaps you did not know that our dear
Brandon shares your passion for music.

505
00:38:24,665 --> 00:38:28,027
He plays the pianoforte very well.

506
00:38:28,135 --> 00:38:32,055
Oh, come. I thought you know
as many melancholy tunes...

507
00:38:32,173 --> 00:38:34,659
as Miss Marianne.

508
00:38:34,775 --> 00:38:36,670
You must play us a duet.

509
00:38:36,777 --> 00:38:39,206
Let us see you both side-by-side.

510
00:38:40,348 --> 00:38:42,971
I do not know any duets.

511
00:38:43,084 --> 00:38:44,979
Forgive me, Colonel.

512
00:38:51,959 --> 00:38:53,895
Are we never to have a moment's peace?

513
00:38:53,995 --> 00:38:57,187
The rent here may be low,
but we have it on very hard terms.

514
00:38:57,298 --> 00:38:59,887
Mrs. Jennings is a wealthy woman
with a married daughter.

515
00:39:00,001 --> 00:39:02,726
She has nothing to do
but marry off everyone else's.

516
00:39:02,837 --> 00:39:04,698
A parcel's arrived for you.

517
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:08,069
- Oh, look.
- Oh, my goodness.

518
00:39:08,175 --> 00:39:11,105
When did this arrive?
Can I open it, please?

519
00:39:11,212 --> 00:39:13,733
It is ridiculous. When is a man safe?

520
00:39:13,848 --> 00:39:17,802
- Age and infirmity do not protect him.
- Infirmity?

521
00:39:17,918 --> 00:39:19,870
If Brandon is infirm,
then I am at death's door.

522
00:39:19,987 --> 00:39:21,882
It is a miracle you're still alive.

523
00:39:21,989 --> 00:39:24,612
Did he not complain
of a rheumatism in his shoulder?

524
00:39:24,725 --> 00:39:27,348
"A slight ache,"
I believe was his phrase.

525
00:39:33,267 --> 00:39:37,062
But Edward said he would
bring it himself.

526
00:39:38,839 --> 00:39:42,736
"Dear Mrs. Dashwood, Miss Dashwood,
Miss Marianne and Captain Margaret...

527
00:39:42,843 --> 00:39:46,280
it gives me great pleasure to restore
this atlas to its rightful owner.

528
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:49,936
Business in London does not
permit me to accompany it.

529
00:39:50,051 --> 00:39:52,947
This is likely to hurt me
far more than it hurts you.

530
00:39:53,054 --> 00:39:56,190
For the present, my memories
of your kindness must sustain me.

531
00:39:56,290 --> 00:39:58,378
I remain your devoted servant.

532
00:39:58,626 --> 00:40:00,782
Always, E.C. Ferrars."

533
00:40:01,862 --> 00:40:03,814
Why hasn't he come?

534
00:40:03,931 --> 00:40:05,826
He says he's busy, dear.

535
00:40:05,933 --> 00:40:07,953
He said he'd come.

536
00:40:08,069 --> 00:40:10,938
- Why hasn't he come?
- I'm taking you for a walk.

537
00:40:11,038 --> 00:40:12,940
- I've been.
- You need another.

538
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,162
- It's going to rain.
- It won't rain.

539
00:40:15,276 --> 00:40:18,695
You always say that,
and then it always does.

540
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:22,603
I fear Mrs. Jennings is a bad influence.

541
00:40:30,391 --> 00:40:32,286
You must miss him.

542
00:40:33,394 --> 00:40:35,289
We are not engaged, Mama.

543
00:40:37,198 --> 00:40:40,686
But he loves you, dearest.
Of that I am certain.

544
00:40:40,801 --> 00:40:43,671
I am by no means assured
of his regard for me.

545
00:40:43,771 --> 00:40:48,192
Were he to feel such a preference,
I think we should be foolish to assume...

546
00:40:48,309 --> 00:40:52,213
that there would not be many obstacles
to his marrying a woman of no rank...

547
00:40:52,313 --> 00:40:54,139
who cannot afford to buy sugar.

548
00:40:54,248 --> 00:40:56,050
Your heart must tell you...

549
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:59,638
In such a situation, it is perhaps
better to use one's head.

550
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:12,183
- This can't be good for me.
- It's very good for you.

551
00:41:12,299 --> 00:41:14,785
- Stop complaining.
- It's giving me a cough.

552
00:41:14,902 --> 00:41:17,161
It is not giving you a cough.

553
00:41:17,271 --> 00:41:21,293
- Please can we go back?
- It's lovely. Come on. Catch up.

554
00:41:24,145 --> 00:41:26,199
Just over that fence...

555
00:41:26,313 --> 00:41:28,208
there's a field full of rabbits.

556
00:41:36,423 --> 00:41:39,182
Is there any felicity in the world
superior to this?

557
00:41:39,293 --> 00:41:41,882
- I told you it would rain.
- There's some blue sky.

558
00:41:41,996 --> 00:41:45,290
- Let us chase it.
- I'm not supposed to run.

559
00:41:51,705 --> 00:41:53,429
Are you hurt?

560
00:41:56,443 --> 00:42:00,781
I do not think I can walk.
You must run and fetch help.

561
00:42:00,881 --> 00:42:03,777
I will run as fast as I can.

562
00:42:23,837 --> 00:42:26,289
Don't be afraid. He's quite safe.

563
00:42:30,711 --> 00:42:32,162
Are you hurt?

564
00:42:32,913 --> 00:42:34,341
Only my ankle.

565
00:42:35,950 --> 00:42:38,778
Have I permission to ascertain
if there are any breaks?

566
00:42:59,306 --> 00:43:01,326
It is not broken.

567
00:43:01,609 --> 00:43:05,097
Now, can you put your arm about my neck?

568
00:43:09,049 --> 00:43:10,978
Allow me to escort you home.

569
00:43:16,657 --> 00:43:18,859
At last.

570
00:43:18,959 --> 00:43:21,753
She fell down, and he's carrying her.

571
00:43:21,862 --> 00:43:23,313
What?

572
00:43:24,765 --> 00:43:27,718
Oh, my darling. Are you hurt?

573
00:43:27,835 --> 00:43:29,730
It's a twisted ankle.

574
00:43:29,837 --> 00:43:32,232
- Do not be alarmed.
- It's not serious.

575
00:43:32,339 --> 00:43:35,809
I took the liberty of feeling the bone.
It's perfectly sound.

576
00:43:35,909 --> 00:43:38,862
- Sir, I cannot even begin to thank you.
- Please do not think of it.

577
00:43:38,979 --> 00:43:40,908
I'm honoured to be of service.

578
00:43:41,015 --> 00:43:42,637
Please, will you not be seated?

579
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:45,646
Pray, excuse me. I have no desire
to leave a water mark...

580
00:43:45,753 --> 00:43:49,616
but permit me to call tomorrow afternoon
and inquire after the patient?

581
00:43:49,723 --> 00:43:53,017
- We shall look forward to it.
- You're kind.

582
00:43:53,127 --> 00:43:54,783
- I'll show you out.
- Thank you.

583
00:43:56,830 --> 00:43:59,919
- Get the gentleman his hat.
- Thank you.

584
00:44:02,002 --> 00:44:04,727
His name.

585
00:44:04,838 --> 00:44:07,608
Could you tell us to whom
we are so much obliged?

586
00:44:07,708 --> 00:44:09,762
John Willoughby of Allenham
at your service.

587
00:44:11,378 --> 00:44:14,172
John Willoughby of Allenham.

588
00:44:16,750 --> 00:44:19,646
What an impressive gentleman.

589
00:44:19,753 --> 00:44:22,581
He lifted me as if I weighed
no more than a dried leaf.

590
00:44:22,690 --> 00:44:24,744
Is he human?

591
00:44:25,626 --> 00:44:27,179
Tell me if I hurt you.

592
00:44:27,294 --> 00:44:29,883
She feels no pain, Mama.

593
00:44:29,997 --> 00:44:33,067
Ask Betsy to make up
a cold compress, please.

594
00:44:33,167 --> 00:44:36,154
- Quickly as you can.
- Please don't say anything important.

595
00:44:36,270 --> 00:44:38,995
- Go on.
- Did you see him?

596
00:44:39,106 --> 00:44:41,001
He expressed himself well, did he not?

597
00:44:41,108 --> 00:44:42,810
With great decorum.

598
00:44:42,910 --> 00:44:44,668
And spirit and wit and feeling.

599
00:44:44,778 --> 00:44:46,206
And economy.

600
00:44:46,313 --> 00:44:47,866
Wait for me!

601
00:44:47,981 --> 00:44:49,603
He's coming tomorrow.

602
00:44:49,717 --> 00:44:51,305
You must change. You'll catch cold.

603
00:44:51,418 --> 00:44:53,313
What care I when there is such a man?

604
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:55,349
You will care when your nose swells up.

605
00:44:55,456 --> 00:44:57,385
You're right. Help me.

606
00:45:00,928 --> 00:45:03,323
Mr. Willoughby's well worth catching.

607
00:45:03,597 --> 00:45:06,550
Miss Marianne must not expect
to have all the men to herself.

608
00:45:06,667 --> 00:45:08,926
What do you know
of Mr. Willoughby, Sir John?

609
00:45:09,770 --> 00:45:11,071
Decent shot.

610
00:45:11,171 --> 00:45:13,240
There's not
a bolder rider in all England.

611
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:14,825
What's he like?

612
00:45:16,076 --> 00:45:18,801
What are his tastes,
his passions, his pursuits?

613
00:45:20,381 --> 00:45:22,333
Well...

614
00:45:22,616 --> 00:45:25,205
he has the smartest
little bitch of a pointer.

615
00:45:25,319 --> 00:45:27,214
Was she out with him yesterday?

616
00:45:27,321 --> 00:45:29,045
Where is Allenham?

617
00:45:29,156 --> 00:45:31,881
Allenham? Nice little estate,
three miles east.

618
00:45:31,992 --> 00:45:34,945
He is to inherit it
from an elderly relative.

619
00:45:35,062 --> 00:45:36,957
Lady Allen is the name.

620
00:45:43,804 --> 00:45:45,323
It's Colonel Brandon.

621
00:45:45,439 --> 00:45:47,800
I shall go outside and keep watch.

622
00:45:49,076 --> 00:45:50,698
Hello, Colonel.

623
00:45:50,811 --> 00:45:53,036
You're all on the lookout
for Willoughby, eh?

624
00:45:53,147 --> 00:45:56,839
Poor Brandon.
Will none of you think of him now?

625
00:45:56,950 --> 00:45:58,378
Come in.

626
00:46:00,687 --> 00:46:02,343
- Colonel.
- Good morning, Brandon.

627
00:46:02,623 --> 00:46:04,552
Good morning.

628
00:46:04,658 --> 00:46:06,553
How's the invalid?

629
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:10,113
Oh, thank you so much, Colonel.
Would you?

630
00:46:10,230 --> 00:46:13,592
I cannot think why you should
set your cap at Willoughby...

631
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:17,119
when you've already made
such a splendid conquest.

632
00:46:17,237 --> 00:46:20,607
I have no intention
of setting my cap at anyone.

633
00:46:20,707 --> 00:46:23,102
Mr. Willoughby, Lady Allen's nephew?

634
00:46:23,210 --> 00:46:25,731
Aye. He visits every year.

635
00:46:27,247 --> 00:46:31,151
And he has a very pretty estate
of his own, you know:

636
00:46:31,251 --> 00:46:34,306
Combe Magna in Somerset.

637
00:46:34,421 --> 00:46:36,782
If I were you,
I would not give him up...

638
00:46:36,890 --> 00:46:39,615
to a younger sister
for all this tumbling downhill.

639
00:46:39,726 --> 00:46:41,780
Marianne's preserver.

640
00:46:41,895 --> 00:46:43,619
Don't run.

641
00:46:43,730 --> 00:46:47,234
The man himself. Come.
We know when we're not wanted.

642
00:46:47,334 --> 00:46:49,354
Let us leave him to the ladies.

643
00:46:51,238 --> 00:46:53,030
Thank you for calling.

644
00:46:56,910 --> 00:46:58,812
The colonel and Sir John are leaving.

645
00:46:58,912 --> 00:47:02,570
Good-bye, Sir John.
Colonel, thank you for the flowers.

646
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:17,350
- How do you do, Colonel?
- How do you do, more like.

647
00:47:17,631 --> 00:47:20,060
Go on in. They're waiting for you.

648
00:47:20,167 --> 00:47:21,925
Come, Briar.

649
00:47:28,408 --> 00:47:30,337
Good day, Mr. Willoughby.

650
00:47:31,678 --> 00:47:33,129
Stop.

651
00:47:39,152 --> 00:47:41,581
What a pleasure to see you again.

652
00:47:41,688 --> 00:47:43,583
The pleasure is all mine, I assure you.

653
00:47:43,690 --> 00:47:45,642
I trust Miss Marianne
has not caught cold?

654
00:47:45,759 --> 00:47:48,655
- You found out my name.
- But of course.

655
00:47:48,762 --> 00:47:50,588
The neighborhood is crawling
with my spies.

656
00:47:51,398 --> 00:47:53,233
And since you cannot
venture out to nature...

657
00:47:53,333 --> 00:47:55,956
nature must be brought to you.

658
00:47:56,870 --> 00:47:59,095
Oh, how beautiful.

659
00:47:59,206 --> 00:48:00,896
These are not from the hothouse.

660
00:48:02,843 --> 00:48:06,706
Ah, I see mine is not the
first offering, nor the most elegant.

661
00:48:06,813 --> 00:48:09,709
I'm afraid I obtained those
from an obliging field.

662
00:48:09,816 --> 00:48:11,711
I've always preferred wildflowers.

663
00:48:11,818 --> 00:48:13,940
I suspected as much.

664
00:48:14,054 --> 00:48:15,949
- Put these in water?
- Yes. Excuse me.

665
00:48:16,056 --> 00:48:19,646
- Our gratitude is beyond expression.
- It is I who am grateful.

666
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:22,849
I've often passed this cottage
and grieved for its lonely state.

667
00:48:22,963 --> 00:48:26,860
Then the first news from Lady Allen
when I arrived was that it was taken.

668
00:48:26,967 --> 00:48:30,659
I felt a peculiar interest,
which nothing can account for...

669
00:48:30,771 --> 00:48:32,962
but my present delight in meeting you.

670
00:48:33,073 --> 00:48:35,594
- Pray, sit down.
- Thank you.

671
00:48:35,709 --> 00:48:38,264
Ah, who is reading
Shakespeare's sonnets?

672
00:48:38,378 --> 00:48:39,966
- I am.
- Marianne.

673
00:48:42,749 --> 00:48:46,146
- Marianne is reading them out to us.
- Which are your favourites?

674
00:48:46,253 --> 00:48:48,580
Without a doubt, mine is 116.

675
00:48:49,990 --> 00:48:53,819
"Let me not to the marriage
of true minds admit impediments.

676
00:48:53,927 --> 00:48:56,049
Love is not love which alters...

677
00:48:56,163 --> 00:48:57,318
when it alteration finds...

678
00:48:57,431 --> 00:49:00,327
or bends with the remover to remove."

679
00:49:01,802 --> 00:49:03,253
How does it continue?

680
00:49:03,370 --> 00:49:07,825
"Oh no: It is an ever-fixed mark
that looks on tempests..."

681
00:49:07,941 --> 00:49:09,563
- ...storms.
- Oh.

682
00:49:09,676 --> 00:49:11,070
Is it "tempests"?

683
00:49:11,178 --> 00:49:14,836
- I do believe it is "tempests."
- Let me find it.

684
00:49:14,948 --> 00:49:18,538
It's strange you should be reading
these, for I carry them always.

685
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:22,149
Oh, how beautiful.

686
00:49:30,364 --> 00:49:32,259
Until tomorrow then.

687
00:49:36,336 --> 00:49:38,925
And my pocket sonnets are yours...

688
00:49:39,039 --> 00:49:41,942
a talisman against further injury.

689
00:49:42,042 --> 00:49:44,801
Good-bye. Thank you.

690
00:49:50,617 --> 00:49:53,046
Good work.

691
00:49:53,153 --> 00:49:56,811
You've covered Shakespeare,
Scott, all forms of poetry.

692
00:49:56,923 --> 00:50:00,376
Another meeting will ascertain his views
on nature and romantic attachments.

693
00:50:00,627 --> 00:50:03,386
Then you will have
nothing left to talk about.

694
00:50:03,664 --> 00:50:05,933
I suppose I have erred against decorum.

695
00:50:06,033 --> 00:50:09,327
I should've been dull and spiritless
and talked only of the weather.

696
00:50:09,436 --> 00:50:14,061
No, but Mr. Willoughby can be
in no doubt of your enthusiasm for him.

697
00:50:14,174 --> 00:50:17,400
Why should he doubt it?
Why should I hide my regard?

698
00:50:17,678 --> 00:50:21,006
No particular reason.
Only that we know so little of him.

699
00:50:21,114 --> 00:50:23,305
Time alone does not determine intimacy.

700
00:50:23,417 --> 00:50:26,186
Seven years would be insufficient
to make some people acquainted...

701
00:50:26,286 --> 00:50:28,772
and seven days can be
more than enough for others.

702
00:50:28,889 --> 00:50:30,757
Or seven hours in this case.

703
00:50:30,857 --> 00:50:33,412
I feel I know Mr. Willoughby already.

704
00:50:33,694 --> 00:50:37,264
If I had more shallow feelings,
I could perhaps conceal them as you do.

705
00:50:37,364 --> 00:50:39,099
That is not fair.

706
00:50:39,199 --> 00:50:42,618
- I'm sorry. I did not mean...
- Do not trouble yourself.

707
00:50:47,674 --> 00:50:50,195
I do not understand her.

708
00:51:23,877 --> 00:51:25,203
Haven't you finished?

709
00:51:27,047 --> 00:51:28,373
Patience.

710
00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:43,848
Surely you're not going
to deny us beef as well as sugar?

711
00:51:43,964 --> 00:51:47,622
There is nothing under ten pence
a pound. We have to economize.

712
00:51:47,734 --> 00:51:49,663
Do you want us to starve?

713
00:51:51,037 --> 00:51:52,932
Just not to eat beef.

714
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:22,295
Slow down for the corner.

715
00:52:24,337 --> 00:52:27,028
Careful. You'll run someone down.

716
00:52:32,078 --> 00:52:33,666
Did you see that?

717
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:35,834
I do think they'll
be married before long.

718
00:52:35,949 --> 00:52:40,187
If there was any true impropriety in
my behaviour, I should be sensible of it.

719
00:52:40,287 --> 00:52:44,116
It has already exposed you
to some very impertinent remarks.

720
00:52:44,224 --> 00:52:46,415
Do you not begin to doubt
your own discretion?

721
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:50,848
If the remarks of Mrs. Jennings
are proof of impropriety...

722
00:52:50,964 --> 00:52:52,722
then we're all offending.

723
00:52:52,833 --> 00:52:55,854
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Colonel.

724
00:52:58,905 --> 00:53:01,596
Miss Dashwood. Miss Marianne.

725
00:53:02,075 --> 00:53:05,028
I come to issue an invitation.

726
00:53:08,215 --> 00:53:11,942
A picnic on my estate at Delaford.

727
00:53:12,052 --> 00:53:14,208
If you would care to join us...

728
00:53:14,321 --> 00:53:15,840
on Thursday next.

729
00:53:17,390 --> 00:53:21,151
Mrs. Jennings' daughter and her husband
are travelling up especially.

730
00:53:24,331 --> 00:53:26,283
We should be delighted.

731
00:53:28,401 --> 00:53:31,661
I will, of course, be including
Mr. Willoughby in the party.

732
00:53:33,406 --> 00:53:35,835
I should be delighted to join you.

733
00:53:41,448 --> 00:53:43,070
Good morning.

734
00:53:45,752 --> 00:53:47,806
The colonel has invited us to Delaford.

735
00:53:47,921 --> 00:53:52,182
Excellent. I understand you have
a fine pianoforte.

736
00:53:52,292 --> 00:53:54,881
A Broadwood grand.

737
00:53:54,995 --> 00:53:57,015
Then I shall be able
to play for you all.

738
00:53:57,130 --> 00:54:00,959
- We shall look forward to it.
- Good day. Walk on. Walk on.

739
00:54:01,902 --> 00:54:03,353
Good-bye.

740
00:54:13,647 --> 00:54:15,735
Your sister seems very happy.

741
00:54:15,849 --> 00:54:17,573
Yes.

742
00:54:17,684 --> 00:54:20,079
Marianne does not approve
of hiding her emotions.

743
00:54:21,922 --> 00:54:26,843
In fact, her romantic prejudices have
the tendency to set propriety at naught.

744
00:54:27,794 --> 00:54:29,723
She is wholly unspoiled.

745
00:54:29,829 --> 00:54:32,732
Rather too unspoiled in my view.

746
00:54:32,832 --> 00:54:36,752
The sooner she becomes acquainted
with the ways of the world the better.

747
00:54:41,975 --> 00:54:43,961
I knew a lady very like your sister...

748
00:54:44,077 --> 00:54:46,939
the same impulsive sweetness
of temper...

749
00:54:47,047 --> 00:54:51,377
who was forced into, as you put it,
"a better acquaintance with the world."

750
00:54:52,919 --> 00:54:56,316
The result was only ruination
and despair.

751
00:54:58,959 --> 00:55:01,252
Do not desire it.

752
00:55:04,998 --> 00:55:08,190
Colonel Brandon's lawn
is perfect for kite launching.

753
00:55:08,301 --> 00:55:11,288
We must have your sky kite.
Mind them pretty ribbons.

754
00:55:11,404 --> 00:55:13,026
Set that in there.

755
00:55:15,608 --> 00:55:19,312
Imagine my surprise when Charlotte
and her lord and master...

756
00:55:19,412 --> 00:55:23,707
appeared with our cousin Lucy,
the last person I expected to see.

757
00:55:23,817 --> 00:55:25,905
She probably came to join in the fun.

758
00:55:26,019 --> 00:55:29,347
There are no funds
for such luxuries at home, poor thing.

759
00:55:29,622 --> 00:55:32,916
I've not seen you for so long,
I couldn't resist the opportunity.

760
00:55:33,026 --> 00:55:37,185
You sly thing. It was the Dashwoods
she wanted to see, not Delaford.

761
00:55:37,297 --> 00:55:42,059
I have heard nothing but "Miss Dashwood
this, Miss Dashwood that."

762
00:55:42,168 --> 00:55:44,324
What do you think
now you do see them, Lucy?

763
00:55:44,437 --> 00:55:48,698
My mother has talked
of nothing else in her letters.

764
00:55:48,808 --> 00:55:52,068
- Are they the creatures she describes?
- Nothing like.

765
00:55:53,446 --> 00:55:57,350
You are quite rude today.
He used to be an M. P.

766
00:55:57,450 --> 00:56:00,403
It's fatiguing, for he's forced
to make everybody like him.

767
00:56:00,620 --> 00:56:03,914
- He says it's quite shocking.
- I never said anything so irrational.

768
00:56:05,058 --> 00:56:08,318
Mr. Palmer is so droll.
He's always out of humour.

769
00:56:08,595 --> 00:56:10,353
Oh. Here he comes.

770
00:56:10,630 --> 00:56:12,559
Now you shall see, Charlotte.

771
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:21,969
Hello.

772
00:56:22,876 --> 00:56:26,068
Come. You must meet
my daughter Charlotte. Mr. Palmer.

773
00:56:26,179 --> 00:56:27,664
How do you do?

774
00:56:27,781 --> 00:56:30,575
And our little cousin, Miss Lucy Steele.

775
00:56:30,683 --> 00:56:32,578
Welcome to our party, Miss Steele.

776
00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:35,208
- Turn about.
- Come round, boys.

777
00:56:36,423 --> 00:56:39,859
I know Mr. Willoughby extremely well.
It's not fair to say...

778
00:56:39,959 --> 00:56:42,896
May I beg a seat beside you?

779
00:56:42,996 --> 00:56:45,016
I've so longed
to make your acquaintance.

780
00:56:45,131 --> 00:56:47,253
I've heard nothing
but the highest praise of you.

781
00:56:48,168 --> 00:56:50,154
I would be delighted.

782
00:56:50,270 --> 00:56:53,166
But Sir John and Mrs. Jennings
are excessive in their compliments.

783
00:56:53,273 --> 00:56:55,168
- Oh, no.
- I'm sure to disappoint.

784
00:56:55,275 --> 00:56:58,137
It was from another source
I heard you praised...

785
00:56:58,244 --> 00:57:00,867
and one not at all inclined
to exaggeration.

786
00:57:01,681 --> 00:57:02,973
What can this be?

787
00:57:14,994 --> 00:57:16,889
- Colonel Brandon here?
- Over here.

788
00:57:16,996 --> 00:57:18,618
There he is.

789
00:57:27,006 --> 00:57:28,594
My horse, quickly.

790
00:57:28,708 --> 00:57:30,261
What's the matter?

791
00:57:30,376 --> 00:57:33,272
- I must away to London.
- No. Impossible.

792
00:57:33,379 --> 00:57:36,036
- Imperative.
- But we're all assembled.

793
00:57:36,149 --> 00:57:40,376
We cannot picnic at Delaford without
a host. Go up to town tomorrow.

794
00:57:40,620 --> 00:57:43,573
Or wait until we return.
You'd not be six hours later.

795
00:57:43,690 --> 00:57:46,745
I cannot afford to lose one minute.

796
00:57:46,860 --> 00:57:48,186
Forgive me.

797
00:57:48,294 --> 00:57:50,223
I hope it's nothing serious.

798
00:57:53,166 --> 00:57:55,618
Upon my soul, this is all very unusual.

799
00:57:55,735 --> 00:57:57,823
Just when I had the opportunity...

800
00:57:58,872 --> 00:58:02,132
Frailty, thy name is Brandon.

801
00:58:02,242 --> 00:58:05,078
There are some people
who cannot bear a party of pleasure.

802
00:58:05,178 --> 00:58:09,803
You're a very wicked pair.
Colonel Brandon will be sadly missed.

803
00:58:09,916 --> 00:58:11,242
Why...

804
00:58:11,351 --> 00:58:16,079
when he is a man that everyone speaks
well of and no one remembers to talk to?

805
00:58:16,189 --> 00:58:20,814
- Exactly.
- Nonsense. He's highly respected.

806
00:58:20,927 --> 00:58:23,880
- Enough censure in itself, hmm?
- Really, Willoughby.

807
00:58:26,032 --> 00:58:27,927
Come, come, Mr. Impudence.

808
00:58:28,034 --> 00:58:30,937
I know you and your wicked ways. Oh!

809
00:58:31,037 --> 00:58:33,940
Come, Miss Dashwood. Reveal your beau.

810
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:36,731
Let's have no secrets.
Let me winkle them out of you.

811
00:58:36,843 --> 00:58:40,262
- Hush.
- I do declare, Miss Marianne.

812
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:44,038
If I do not have you married by teatime,
I shall swallow my own bonnet.

813
00:58:45,418 --> 00:58:47,313
As if you could marry such a character.

814
00:58:48,254 --> 00:58:50,274
Why should you dislike him?

815
00:58:51,958 --> 00:58:55,047
Because he has threatened me with rain
when I wanted it fine.

816
00:58:56,429 --> 00:58:59,655
He has found fault with the balance
of my high flyer...

817
00:58:59,766 --> 00:59:02,628
and I cannot persuade him
to buy my mare.

818
00:59:02,735 --> 00:59:05,256
If it will be of any satisfaction
to you, however...

819
00:59:05,371 --> 00:59:07,994
to be told that I believe
his character...

820
00:59:08,107 --> 00:59:11,578
to be irreproachable,
then I'm ready to confess it.

821
00:59:11,678 --> 00:59:14,699
In return for such
a painful acknowledgment...

822
00:59:14,814 --> 00:59:17,608
you cannot deny me the privilege...

823
00:59:17,717 --> 00:59:20,613
of disliking him as much as I adore...

824
00:59:25,758 --> 00:59:27,687
this cottage.

825
00:59:29,195 --> 00:59:30,817
I have great plans...

826
00:59:30,930 --> 00:59:32,722
for improvements to it.

827
00:59:32,832 --> 00:59:36,320
Now, that I will never consent to.

828
00:59:36,603 --> 00:59:38,964
Not a stone must be added to its walls.

829
00:59:40,940 --> 00:59:43,563
Were I rich enough,
I would pull down Combe Magna...

830
00:59:43,676 --> 00:59:45,571
and rebuild it like this cottage.

831
00:59:45,678 --> 00:59:47,113
With dark narrow stairs...

832
00:59:47,213 --> 00:59:50,316
a poky hall and a fire
that smokes, I suppose.

833
00:59:50,416 --> 00:59:52,971
Especially the fire that smokes.

834
00:59:54,220 --> 00:59:56,581
For then I should be as happy
at Combe as I have been at Barton.

835
00:59:58,324 --> 01:00:01,982
This has one claim on my affections
that none other can possibly share.

836
01:00:04,163 --> 01:00:06,592
Promise me you'll never change it.

837
01:00:12,772 --> 01:00:14,997
I'm honoured that so fair
and virtuous a lady...

838
01:00:15,108 --> 01:00:19,267
should compromise her honour
by seeing me to the gate unaccompanied.

839
01:00:19,379 --> 01:00:22,138
That is exactly what Elinor would say.

840
01:00:22,248 --> 01:00:25,178
And she would be right.

841
01:00:25,285 --> 01:00:29,342
Miss Marianne, will you do me the honor
of granting me an interview tomorrow?

842
01:00:29,455 --> 01:00:33,216
- Alone?
- Oh, Willoughby, we're always alone.

843
01:00:33,326 --> 01:00:35,762
But there is...

844
01:00:35,862 --> 01:00:38,621
There's something very particular
I should like to ask you.

845
01:00:40,266 --> 01:00:41,888
Of course.

846
01:00:43,169 --> 01:00:46,327
I shall ask Mama
if I may stay behind from church.

847
01:00:47,774 --> 01:00:49,703
Thank you.

848
01:00:51,144 --> 01:00:53,198
Until tomorrow, then.

849
01:00:56,115 --> 01:00:58,010
Miss Marianne.

850
01:01:08,361 --> 01:01:10,730
O Virtue.

851
01:01:10,830 --> 01:01:13,658
Silently and with fear, enter Thou...

852
01:01:13,766 --> 01:01:16,821
into the hearts of all them
that hear me this day.

853
01:01:16,936 --> 01:01:18,865
Do you think he'll kneel down
when he asks her?

854
01:01:18,971 --> 01:01:21,400
The fear of Him
is the beginning of wisdom.

855
01:01:21,674 --> 01:01:26,095
- They always kneel down.
- Good understanding have all that do.

856
01:01:26,913 --> 01:01:29,308
Margaret, Margaret, come back.

857
01:01:29,415 --> 01:01:31,344
- Splendid sermon.
- Splendid.

858
01:01:31,451 --> 01:01:33,380
Oh, no!

859
01:01:38,124 --> 01:01:40,019
What is wrong, dearest?

860
01:01:41,461 --> 01:01:44,931
Willoughby, what is the matter?

861
01:01:45,031 --> 01:01:47,256
I must...

862
01:01:47,367 --> 01:01:51,355
Forgive me, Mrs. Dashwood. I'm sent...

863
01:01:51,471 --> 01:01:55,994
That is to say, Lady Allen has exercised
the privilege of riches...

864
01:01:56,109 --> 01:01:59,164
upon a dependent cousin
and is sending me to London.

865
01:01:59,278 --> 01:02:01,036
When? This morning?

866
01:02:01,147 --> 01:02:04,134
- Almost this moment.
- What a disappointment.

867
01:02:04,250 --> 01:02:07,942
But your business will not detain you
for long, I hope?

868
01:02:09,021 --> 01:02:10,916
You're very kind, but...

869
01:02:11,023 --> 01:02:15,228
I have no idea of returning
immediately into Devonshire.

870
01:02:15,328 --> 01:02:17,917
I'm seldom invited to Allenham
more than once a year.

871
01:02:18,030 --> 01:02:21,324
For shame. Can you wait
for an invitation from Barton Cottage?

872
01:02:23,269 --> 01:02:26,199
My engagements at present
are of such a nature...

873
01:02:27,039 --> 01:02:28,627
That is to say...

874
01:02:28,741 --> 01:02:31,262
I dare not flatter my...

875
01:02:31,377 --> 01:02:35,206
It is folly to linger.
I will not torment myself further.

876
01:02:37,016 --> 01:02:39,969
Willoughby, come back:

877
01:02:40,086 --> 01:02:44,279
Margaret, ask Betsy to make a cup
of hot tea for Marianne.

878
01:02:44,390 --> 01:02:47,411
- What is wrong, my love?
- Do not ask me questions.

879
01:02:47,660 --> 01:02:50,181
- Betsy:
- Please, let me be!

880
01:02:57,103 --> 01:02:59,055
They must have quarrelled.

881
01:02:59,172 --> 01:03:01,067
That is unlikely.

882
01:03:02,608 --> 01:03:04,332
Perhaps this Lady Allen...

883
01:03:04,610 --> 01:03:07,699
disapproves of his regard
for Marianne....

884
01:03:07,814 --> 01:03:09,709
and has invented an excuse
to send him away.

885
01:03:09,816 --> 01:03:12,940
Then why did he not say as much?

886
01:03:13,052 --> 01:03:15,743
It is not like Willoughby
to be secretive.

887
01:03:15,855 --> 01:03:18,376
- What is it you suspect him of?
- I can hardly tell you.

888
01:03:19,325 --> 01:03:22,187
- But why was his manner so guilty?
- What are you saying?

889
01:03:22,295 --> 01:03:25,157
That he's been acting a part
for all this time?

890
01:03:25,264 --> 01:03:28,217
- No, he loves her. I'm sure.
- Of course he loves her!

891
01:03:30,336 --> 01:03:34,097
Has he left her with any assurance
of his return?

892
01:03:34,207 --> 01:03:37,001
Cannot you ask her if he has proposed?

893
01:03:37,109 --> 01:03:41,131
Certainly not. I cannot force
a confidence, nor should you.

894
01:03:42,415 --> 01:03:46,039
We must trust her to confide in us
in her own time.

895
01:03:47,987 --> 01:03:51,611
There was something so underhand
in the manner of his leaving.

896
01:03:51,724 --> 01:03:54,227
- You are resolved to think the worst?
- I'm not resolved.

897
01:03:54,327 --> 01:03:56,882
I prefer to give him
the benefit of my good opinion.

898
01:03:56,996 --> 01:03:59,323
He deserves no less from all of us!

899
01:04:00,433 --> 01:04:03,363
Mama, I am very fond of Willoughby.

900
01:04:11,677 --> 01:04:13,572
She would not let me in.

901
01:04:51,250 --> 01:04:53,145
To sail us up the river.

902
01:04:54,987 --> 01:04:56,916
How will we travel on land?

903
01:05:00,326 --> 01:05:02,812
If only this rain would stop!

904
01:05:02,929 --> 01:05:04,585
If only you would stop.

905
01:05:06,232 --> 01:05:08,821
It was you who took her
off my hands, Mr. Palmer.

906
01:05:08,935 --> 01:05:11,888
And a very good bargain
you made of it too.

907
01:05:12,004 --> 01:05:15,662
Now I have the whip hand over you,
for you cannot give her back.

908
01:05:19,712 --> 01:05:22,315
Miss Marianne,
come and play a round with us.

909
01:05:22,415 --> 01:05:24,970
Looking out at the weather
will not bring him back.

910
01:05:25,084 --> 01:05:27,036
She ate nothing at dinner.

911
01:05:27,153 --> 01:05:29,207
We're all a little forlorn.

912
01:05:29,322 --> 01:05:31,945
London has swallowed our company.

913
01:05:32,058 --> 01:05:37,616
Dear Miss Dashwood,
perhaps we might have our discussion.

914
01:05:37,730 --> 01:05:39,565
Our discussion?

915
01:05:39,665 --> 01:05:42,754
There is a particular question
I've long wanted to ask you.

916
01:05:42,868 --> 01:05:44,820
But perhaps you'll think me impertinent?

917
01:05:44,937 --> 01:05:47,196
- I cannot imagine so.
- It is an odd question.

918
01:05:47,306 --> 01:05:49,258
- I have no wish to trouble you.
- Miss Steele...

919
01:05:49,375 --> 01:05:50,963
If only Mr. Willoughby...

920
01:05:51,077 --> 01:05:53,734
had gone home to Combe Magna,
we could have taken...

921
01:05:53,846 --> 01:05:56,332
Miss Marianne to see him,
for we live but half a mile away.

922
01:05:56,449 --> 01:06:00,608
- Five and a half.
- I cannot believe it.

923
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:05,084
You can see the place from our hill.
Is it really? I cannot believe it.

924
01:06:05,925 --> 01:06:07,854
Try.

925
01:06:08,861 --> 01:06:12,758
You have my permission to ask
any question, if that is of any help.

926
01:06:12,865 --> 01:06:15,124
Thank you.

927
01:06:15,234 --> 01:06:19,131
Are you at all acquainted
with your sister-in-law's mother?

928
01:06:19,238 --> 01:06:21,258
Mrs. Ferrars?

929
01:06:21,374 --> 01:06:24,065
With Fanny's mother?

930
01:06:24,176 --> 01:06:27,766
No, I have never met her.

931
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:31,183
You must think me strange for inquiring.

932
01:06:31,283 --> 01:06:34,213
If only I dared tell it.

933
01:06:35,421 --> 01:06:38,010
If she tells you aught
of the famous Mr. F...

934
01:06:38,124 --> 01:06:40,349
you must pass it on.

935
01:06:42,294 --> 01:06:44,689
Will you take a turn
with me, Miss Dashwood?

936
01:06:44,797 --> 01:06:46,692
Of course.

937
01:06:50,336 --> 01:06:52,663
I had no idea...

938
01:06:52,772 --> 01:06:56,362
that you were at all connected
with that family.

939
01:06:56,642 --> 01:07:00,039
I am certainly nothing
to Mrs. Ferrars at present...

940
01:07:00,146 --> 01:07:02,871
but the time may come...

941
01:07:02,982 --> 01:07:06,743
when we may be very
intimately connected.

942
01:07:07,853 --> 01:07:09,748
What do you mean?

943
01:07:13,359 --> 01:07:14,912
Do you have an...

944
01:07:15,027 --> 01:07:17,530
Do you have an understanding
with Fanny's brother Robert?

945
01:07:17,630 --> 01:07:19,616
The youngest?

946
01:07:19,732 --> 01:07:22,535
No. I never met him in my life.

947
01:07:22,635 --> 01:07:25,224
No, with Edward.

948
01:07:29,675 --> 01:07:33,299
Edward and I
have been secretly engaged...

949
01:07:33,412 --> 01:07:35,864
these five years.

950
01:07:39,251 --> 01:07:40,873
You may well be surprised.

951
01:07:42,288 --> 01:07:47,209
I should never have mentioned it if I
could not trust you to keep our secret.

952
01:07:47,326 --> 01:07:49,084
Edward would not mind...

953
01:07:49,195 --> 01:07:52,592
for he looks on you as his own sister.

954
01:07:55,267 --> 01:07:58,857
I'm sorry. We... Surely we...

955
01:08:01,807 --> 01:08:04,965
We surely do not mean
the same Mr. Ferrars.

956
01:08:05,077 --> 01:08:06,801
The very same.

957
01:08:06,912 --> 01:08:11,640
He was four years under the tutelage
of my uncle, Mr. Pratt, in Plymouth.

958
01:08:11,751 --> 01:08:13,873
Has he never spoken of it?

959
01:08:15,321 --> 01:08:17,648
I believe he has.

960
01:08:20,226 --> 01:08:22,028
I was very unwilling...

961
01:08:22,128 --> 01:08:24,319
without his mother's approval.

962
01:08:24,597 --> 01:08:27,118
But we loved each other
with too great a passion for prudence.

963
01:08:28,768 --> 01:08:31,562
Though you do not know him
as well as I...

964
01:08:31,670 --> 01:08:33,895
you must have seen his ability...

965
01:08:34,006 --> 01:08:36,868
to make a woman
sincerely attached to him.

966
01:08:39,111 --> 01:08:43,133
I cannot pretend it has not been
very hard on us both.

967
01:08:43,249 --> 01:08:46,702
We can scarcely meet above twice a year.

968
01:08:57,730 --> 01:09:01,559
- You seem out of sorts. Are you well?
- Perfectly well. Thank you.

969
01:09:01,667 --> 01:09:04,570
- I've not offended you?
- On the contrary.

970
01:09:04,670 --> 01:09:06,064
I cannot stand it.

971
01:09:06,172 --> 01:09:08,040
I must know what you are saying.

972
01:09:08,140 --> 01:09:09,932
If anyone finds out, it will ruin him.

973
01:09:10,042 --> 01:09:12,631
Promise me you'll not tell.

974
01:09:12,745 --> 01:09:15,581
Miss Dashwood is quite engrossed.

975
01:09:15,681 --> 01:09:18,133
- No secrets, Lucy.
- I give you my word.

976
01:09:19,718 --> 01:09:23,615
What can have fascinated you
to such an extent, Miss Dashwood?

977
01:09:23,722 --> 01:09:24,877
Tell us all:

978
01:09:24,990 --> 01:09:29,081
We were talking of London, ma'am,
and of all its diversions.

979
01:09:29,195 --> 01:09:33,286
- Do you hear that, Charlotte?
- While you were whispering...

980
01:09:33,399 --> 01:09:35,760
Charlotte and I have concocted a plan.

981
01:09:35,868 --> 01:09:37,854
It is the best plan in the world!

982
01:09:37,970 --> 01:09:42,630
I make for London shortly,
and I invite you, Lucy...

983
01:09:42,741 --> 01:09:44,761
and both the Misses Dashwood to join me.

984
01:09:44,877 --> 01:09:48,171
- Splendid idea.
- London:

985
01:09:50,416 --> 01:09:53,278
- Can I go?
- You're too young.

986
01:09:53,385 --> 01:09:58,023
I shall convey you to Chelsea, and we
will taste the delights of the season.

987
01:09:58,123 --> 01:10:02,316
- What say you?
- Please can I go? I'm 12 soon:

988
01:10:02,428 --> 01:10:06,732
Mr. Palmer, do you not long to have
the Misses Dashwood come to London?

989
01:10:06,832 --> 01:10:09,762
I came into Devonshire
with no other view.

990
01:10:11,170 --> 01:10:13,895
Mrs. Jennings, you are very kind.

991
01:10:14,006 --> 01:10:17,309
- But we cannot leave our mother.
- Your mother can spare you very well!

992
01:10:17,409 --> 01:10:20,237
- Of course I can!
- Of course she can!

993
01:10:20,346 --> 01:10:23,799
I could not be more delighted.
It is exactly what I would wish.

994
01:10:23,916 --> 01:10:26,846
I will brook no refusal, Miss Dashwood.

995
01:10:26,952 --> 01:10:29,221
Let us strike hands on the bargain.

996
01:10:29,321 --> 01:10:31,648
And if I do not have the three of you...

997
01:10:31,757 --> 01:10:36,087
married by Michaelmas,
it will not be my fault.

998
01:10:44,003 --> 01:10:48,424
I was never so grateful in all my life
as I am to Mrs. Jennings.

999
01:10:48,707 --> 01:10:52,866
I shall see Willoughby,
and you will see Edward!

1000
01:10:52,978 --> 01:10:54,907
Are you asleep?

1001
01:10:56,282 --> 01:10:59,303
With you in the room?

1002
01:10:59,418 --> 01:11:03,975
I do not believe you feel
as calm as you look. Not even you.

1003
01:11:04,089 --> 01:11:07,110
I will never sleep tonight.

1004
01:11:07,226 --> 01:11:10,782
What were you and Miss Steele
talking about so long?

1005
01:11:11,897 --> 01:11:13,792
Nothing of significance.

1006
01:11:19,371 --> 01:11:21,300
You must look after Mama:

1007
01:11:24,176 --> 01:11:26,162
We will!

1008
01:11:27,279 --> 01:11:29,208
Good-bye:

1009
01:11:32,451 --> 01:11:34,903
How do you think I live, poking about...

1010
01:11:35,020 --> 01:11:38,883
in that house by myself when I
have been used to having Charlotte...

1011
01:11:38,991 --> 01:11:40,749
until she had the baby?

1012
01:11:40,859 --> 01:11:43,152
I have written to Edward.

1013
01:11:43,262 --> 01:11:45,953
And yet I do not know
how much I may see of him.

1014
01:11:46,065 --> 01:11:49,154
Secrecy is vital.
He'll never be able to call.

1015
01:11:49,268 --> 01:11:51,789
I should imagine not.

1016
01:11:51,904 --> 01:11:54,231
It's so hard.
I believe my only comfort...

1017
01:11:54,340 --> 01:11:56,792
has been the constancy of his affection.

1018
01:11:56,909 --> 01:11:59,361
You're fortunate,
over such a lengthy engagement...

1019
01:11:59,478 --> 01:12:01,839
never to have had any doubts
on that score.

1020
01:12:01,947 --> 01:12:05,139
Oh. I'm of rather a jealous nature.

1021
01:12:05,250 --> 01:12:09,375
If he talked more
of one young woman than any other...

1022
01:12:09,655 --> 01:12:12,278
But he's never given a moment's alarm
on that count.

1023
01:12:14,393 --> 01:12:17,255
Imagine how glad he'll be
to learn that we are friends.

1024
01:12:24,336 --> 01:12:27,733
- There you are. Have you missed me?
- Very much, ma'am.

1025
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:30,643
You always say so, and I never believe
you. I trust everything's in order?

1026
01:12:30,743 --> 01:12:33,646
In good order, ma'am, though I might
suggest the ordering of coal.

1027
01:12:33,746 --> 01:12:35,648
Don't talk to me of coals.

1028
01:12:35,748 --> 01:12:38,269
There you are, Pooter.
Still alive, I see.

1029
01:12:38,384 --> 01:12:42,221
- Tea, Pigeon. Tea.
- Yes, ma'am.

1030
01:12:42,321 --> 01:12:44,807
Well, you do not waste any time.

1031
01:12:44,923 --> 01:12:47,148
Give it to Pigeon. He'll see to it.

1032
01:12:47,259 --> 01:12:51,597
- Come along dear.
- A letter. They're definitely engaged.

1033
01:12:51,697 --> 01:12:54,934
Mrs. Jennings says your sister
will buy her wedding clothes in town.

1034
01:12:55,034 --> 01:12:57,054
I know of no such plan.

1035
01:12:58,737 --> 01:13:03,101
John and Fanny are in town.
I think we shall be forced to see them.

1036
01:13:06,979 --> 01:13:08,874
See.

1037
01:13:12,751 --> 01:13:16,375
- I think it was for next door.
- Yes, you are right.

1038
01:13:16,622 --> 01:13:19,984
Marianne, do sit down
for two seconds together.

1039
01:13:20,092 --> 01:13:21,987
You're making me nervous.

1040
01:13:28,167 --> 01:13:33,225
- Good afternoon, sir.
- Is Miss Marianne here?

1041
01:13:33,338 --> 01:13:36,666
- Shh.
- Who shall I say is calling?

1042
01:13:36,775 --> 01:13:38,761
Very good, sir.

1043
01:13:38,877 --> 01:13:40,863
Oh, Elinor, it is Willoughby.

1044
01:13:42,714 --> 01:13:44,609
Indeed, it is.

1045
01:13:51,990 --> 01:13:54,613
Excuse me, Colonel.

1046
01:13:55,661 --> 01:13:57,385
Colonel.

1047
01:13:59,198 --> 01:14:01,855
What a pleasure to see you.

1048
01:14:01,967 --> 01:14:06,126
- Have you been in London all this while?
- Forgive me, Miss Dashwood.

1049
01:14:08,173 --> 01:14:11,035
I have heard reports through town...

1050
01:14:11,143 --> 01:14:12,969
that...

1051
01:14:15,380 --> 01:14:17,639
Tell me once and for all.

1052
01:14:19,251 --> 01:14:23,842
Is everything finally resolved
between your sister and Mr. Willoughby?

1053
01:14:26,925 --> 01:14:29,728
Colonel, though neither one
has informed me...

1054
01:14:29,828 --> 01:14:32,731
of their understanding...

1055
01:14:32,831 --> 01:14:36,250
I have no doubt
of their mutual affection.

1056
01:14:38,670 --> 01:14:40,394
Thank you, Miss Dashwood.

1057
01:14:42,908 --> 01:14:46,669
To your sister,
I wish all imaginable happiness.

1058
01:14:47,913 --> 01:14:49,307
To Mr. Willoughby...

1059
01:14:49,414 --> 01:14:54,074
that he may endeavour to deserve her.

1060
01:14:55,721 --> 01:14:57,172
What do you mean?

1061
01:15:00,225 --> 01:15:02,051
Forgive me, I...

1062
01:15:21,013 --> 01:15:24,137
Where is dear Edward, John?
We expect to see him daily.

1063
01:15:24,249 --> 01:15:27,338
- Who is "dear Edward," may I ask?
- Who, indeed?

1064
01:15:27,619 --> 01:15:30,913
My brother, Mrs. Jennings.
Mr. Edward Ferrars.

1065
01:15:31,023 --> 01:15:35,045
Indeed: Is that Ferrars with an "F"?

1066
01:15:41,333 --> 01:15:43,922
Are there any messages, Pigeon?

1067
01:15:44,036 --> 01:15:47,160
- No messages at all? No cards?
- None, ma'am.

1068
01:15:47,272 --> 01:15:50,634
I notice you do not inquire
for your messages.

1069
01:15:50,742 --> 01:15:52,762
No, indeed, for I do not expect any.

1070
01:15:52,878 --> 01:15:55,399
I have no... very little
acquaintance in town.

1071
01:16:13,932 --> 01:16:16,020
I don't want to hear another word
about the ham bone, Pigeon.

1072
01:16:16,134 --> 01:16:19,030
You and Cartwright
must sort that out between you.

1073
01:16:19,137 --> 01:16:21,123
No messages, ma'am.

1074
01:16:21,240 --> 01:16:26,662
Now, do not fret, my dear. I have
been told that this good weather...

1075
01:16:26,778 --> 01:16:29,982
is keeping many of our sportsmen
in the country at present.

1076
01:16:30,082 --> 01:16:34,319
But the frost will soon
drive them to town. Depend on it.

1077
01:16:34,419 --> 01:16:37,281
Of course. I had not thought of that.

1078
01:16:37,389 --> 01:16:39,750
Thank you, Mrs. Jennings.

1079
01:16:39,858 --> 01:16:42,060
And Miss Dashwood
may set her heart at rest...

1080
01:16:42,160 --> 01:16:44,282
for I overheard
your sister-in-law say...

1081
01:16:44,396 --> 01:16:48,225
she is to invite the elusive Mr. F
to the ball tonight!

1082
01:16:49,268 --> 01:16:53,359
Do be careful, dears.
The horses have been here.

1083
01:16:53,639 --> 01:16:56,626
Careful. It's beginning to rain also.

1084
01:16:56,742 --> 01:16:58,671
Now follow me.

1085
01:17:03,849 --> 01:17:05,744
Whoops.

1086
01:17:14,026 --> 01:17:16,012
Steady.

1087
01:17:17,896 --> 01:17:21,588
This is madness!
This is dribbling, babbling madness!

1088
01:17:29,608 --> 01:17:31,332
This is very merry!

1089
01:17:33,378 --> 01:17:36,331
- Oh, do you spy anyone we know?
- Not a soul.

1090
01:17:36,615 --> 01:17:38,373
Ask Mr. Palmer to look.
He has a better view.

1091
01:17:38,617 --> 01:17:42,139
Mr. Palmer, do you see anyone
of our acquaintance?

1092
01:17:42,254 --> 01:17:45,742
- Unfortunately not.
- How can you be such a tease?

1093
01:17:45,857 --> 01:17:49,618
There is Mrs. John Dashwood.
I can see her for myself.

1094
01:17:50,796 --> 01:17:53,658
Hello: Come along, my dears.

1095
01:17:58,970 --> 01:18:02,040
There you are!

1096
01:18:02,140 --> 01:18:04,626
- Mrs. Jennings.
- Goodness, how hot it is.

1097
01:18:04,743 --> 01:18:06,763
- Indeed.
- You're not alone, I trust?

1098
01:18:06,878 --> 01:18:09,637
Indeed, no. John is just gone
to fetch my brother.

1099
01:18:09,748 --> 01:18:11,650
They've been eating ices.

1100
01:18:11,750 --> 01:18:13,838
Your brother! I declare!

1101
01:18:13,952 --> 01:18:16,905
This is good news, indeed. At long last.

1102
01:18:18,757 --> 01:18:21,152
I declare, I shall faint clean away.

1103
01:18:21,259 --> 01:18:23,313
Mrs. Jennings, I am pleased to see you.

1104
01:18:24,629 --> 01:18:26,531
May I present my brother-in-law...

1105
01:18:26,631 --> 01:18:28,924
Mr. Robert Ferrars.

1106
01:18:35,273 --> 01:18:38,226
My dear ladies, we meet at last.

1107
01:18:41,613 --> 01:18:43,201
You must be the younger brother.

1108
01:18:43,315 --> 01:18:45,073
Is Mr. Edward not here?

1109
01:18:45,183 --> 01:18:47,169
Miss Dashwood here was counting on him.

1110
01:18:47,285 --> 01:18:48,907
He's far too busy...

1111
01:18:49,020 --> 01:18:52,007
for such gatherings and has
no special acquaintance here...

1112
01:18:52,124 --> 01:18:54,178
to make his attendance worthwhile.

1113
01:18:55,894 --> 01:18:59,222
I declare, I do not know
what the young men are about these days.

1114
01:18:59,331 --> 01:19:01,260
Are they all in hiding?

1115
01:19:01,366 --> 01:19:04,785
Come, Mr. Robert.
In the absence of your brother...

1116
01:19:04,903 --> 01:19:07,332
you must dance with our lovely
Miss Dashwood here.

1117
01:19:12,677 --> 01:19:15,334
It would be my honour.

1118
01:19:20,819 --> 01:19:22,611
And perhaps Miss Steele...

1119
01:19:22,721 --> 01:19:26,015
might consider reserving the allemande.

1120
01:20:07,199 --> 01:20:09,924
You reside in Devonshire,
I believe, Miss Dashwood?

1121
01:20:14,673 --> 01:20:16,397
In a cottage?

1122
01:20:19,878 --> 01:20:22,774
I am excessively fond of a cottage.

1123
01:20:25,250 --> 01:20:28,977
If I had any money to spare,
I should build one myself.

1124
01:20:43,869 --> 01:20:45,991
How do you do, Miss Dashwood?

1125
01:20:46,104 --> 01:20:48,795
I'm very well, thank you.

1126
01:20:48,907 --> 01:20:52,201
- How's your family?
- They're all extremely well.

1127
01:20:54,980 --> 01:20:57,068
Thank you for your kind inquiry.

1128
01:21:04,289 --> 01:21:05,911
Who is it?

1129
01:21:06,024 --> 01:21:08,749
She came in with Mrs. Jennings.

1130
01:21:08,860 --> 01:21:10,652
With Mrs. John Dashwood.

1131
01:21:13,665 --> 01:21:15,116
Good God, Willoughby.

1132
01:21:18,870 --> 01:21:21,061
Will you not shake hands with me?

1133
01:21:22,774 --> 01:21:24,669
How do you do, Miss Marianne?

1134
01:21:28,280 --> 01:21:30,141
What is the matter?

1135
01:21:30,248 --> 01:21:33,076
Why have you not come to see me?

1136
01:21:34,252 --> 01:21:38,013
Were you not in London?
Have you not received my letters?

1137
01:21:39,124 --> 01:21:43,021
I had the pleasure of receiving
the information you sent me.

1138
01:21:45,297 --> 01:21:49,786
For heaven's sake, Willoughby.
Tell me what is wrong.

1139
01:21:52,137 --> 01:21:54,328
Thank you. I'm most obliged.

1140
01:21:55,941 --> 01:21:59,030
If you will excuse me,
I must rejoin my party.

1141
01:22:12,223 --> 01:22:14,118
Ah, Willoughby.

1142
01:22:20,765 --> 01:22:24,093
Go to him, Elinor.
Force him to come to me instantly.

1143
01:22:24,202 --> 01:22:26,927
Marianne, you must come away.

1144
01:22:30,942 --> 01:22:33,030
Do you know them?

1145
01:22:33,144 --> 01:22:35,164
Acquaintances from the country.

1146
01:22:37,782 --> 01:22:41,736
Indeed. Wearing
their country fashions, I see.

1147
01:22:45,357 --> 01:22:47,411
Come away, dearest.

1148
01:22:56,368 --> 01:22:58,354
I do not understand.

1149
01:22:58,470 --> 01:23:01,195
- I must speak to him.
- There you are, my dear!

1150
01:23:01,306 --> 01:23:05,135
Oh, my goodness!
Come, dear. You need some air.

1151
01:23:11,416 --> 01:23:15,040
- She called out his name.
- John Dashwood's sisters.

1152
01:23:21,026 --> 01:23:23,228
- Come, dear. We must go.
- We're leaving so soon?

1153
01:23:23,328 --> 01:23:27,899
If I might be so bold, it would be
our pleasure to escort your charge home.

1154
01:23:27,999 --> 01:23:31,191
- How very kind.
- That is very handsome of you.

1155
01:23:31,302 --> 01:23:33,322
She actually sent him messages
during the night?

1156
01:23:33,438 --> 01:23:36,857
Yes, indeed.
Mr. Pigeon was not himself all day.

1157
01:23:47,285 --> 01:23:49,305
Marianne, please tell me.

1158
01:23:49,421 --> 01:23:51,890
Do not ask me questions.

1159
01:23:51,990 --> 01:23:54,078
You have no confidence in me.

1160
01:23:54,192 --> 01:23:58,317
This reproach from you?
You who confide in no one?

1161
01:24:00,632 --> 01:24:02,220
I have nothing to tell.

1162
01:24:02,333 --> 01:24:05,923
Nor I. Neither of us
have anything to tell.

1163
01:24:06,037 --> 01:24:09,593
I, because I conceal nothing, and you,
because you communicate nothing.

1164
01:24:17,916 --> 01:24:22,644
I wish Lady Charteris would limit her
invitation list. It was so warm.

1165
01:24:22,754 --> 01:24:24,649
I'm glad we left early.

1166
01:24:26,858 --> 01:24:29,185
There, now.

1167
01:24:33,732 --> 01:24:38,187
Lovers' quarrels are swift to heal.

1168
01:24:38,303 --> 01:24:42,724
That letter will do the trick.
Mark my words. I must be off.

1169
01:24:42,841 --> 01:24:47,796
I do hope he doesn't
keep her waiting much longer.

1170
01:24:47,912 --> 01:24:50,842
It hurts to see her looking so forlorn.

1171
01:24:50,949 --> 01:24:53,184
Pigeon!

1172
01:24:53,284 --> 01:24:56,874
What a welcome I had
from Edward's family.

1173
01:24:56,988 --> 01:25:00,783
I'm surprised you never mentioned
how agreeable your sister-in-law is.

1174
01:25:00,892 --> 01:25:03,344
And Mr. Robert. All so affable.

1175
01:25:03,595 --> 01:25:06,957
It is perhaps fortunate that
none of them knows of your engagement.

1176
01:25:07,065 --> 01:25:08,960
Excuse me.

1177
01:25:18,109 --> 01:25:20,698
"My dear madam, I'm at a loss...

1178
01:25:20,812 --> 01:25:25,073
to discover how
I could have offended you.

1179
01:25:25,183 --> 01:25:27,078
My esteem for your family
is very sincere...

1180
01:25:27,185 --> 01:25:30,980
but if I have given rise to a belief of
more than I felt or meant to express...

1181
01:25:31,089 --> 01:25:34,850
I shall reproach myself
for not having been more guarded.

1182
01:25:34,959 --> 01:25:38,117
My affections have long
been engaged elsewhere.

1183
01:25:38,229 --> 01:25:41,099
It is with great regret that I return
your letters and the lock of hair...

1184
01:25:41,199 --> 01:25:44,220
which you so obligingly
bestowed upon me.

1185
01:25:44,335 --> 01:25:46,230
I am..." Etcetera. "John Willoughby."

1186
01:25:51,342 --> 01:25:53,237
Dearest.

1187
01:25:56,247 --> 01:25:58,403
It is best to know
what his intentions are at once.

1188
01:25:58,683 --> 01:26:01,909
Think how you would have felt if your
engagement had continued for months...

1189
01:26:02,020 --> 01:26:03,915
before he chose to put an end to it.

1190
01:26:04,022 --> 01:26:06,713
We're not engaged.

1191
01:26:06,825 --> 01:26:11,917
But you wrote to him. I thought he left
you with some kind of understanding.

1192
01:26:12,030 --> 01:26:15,586
No, he's not so unworthy
as you think him.

1193
01:26:15,700 --> 01:26:19,188
Not so unworthy?
Did he tell you that he loved you?

1194
01:26:19,304 --> 01:26:21,773
Yes.

1195
01:26:21,873 --> 01:26:25,167
No. Never absolutely.

1196
01:26:25,276 --> 01:26:28,113
It was every day implied,
but never declared.

1197
01:26:28,213 --> 01:26:31,905
Sometimes I thought it had been,
but it never was.

1198
01:26:32,016 --> 01:26:33,968
He has broken no vow.

1199
01:26:34,085 --> 01:26:38,073
He's broken faith with all of us!
He made us all believe he loved you:

1200
01:26:38,189 --> 01:26:40,084
He did.

1201
01:26:41,693 --> 01:26:44,054
He loved me as I loved him.

1202
01:26:47,298 --> 01:26:51,218
I had to come straight up.
How are you, Miss Marianne?

1203
01:26:51,336 --> 01:26:54,630
Oh, poor thing. She looks very bad.

1204
01:26:54,739 --> 01:26:57,066
'Tis no wonder, for 'tis but too true.

1205
01:26:57,175 --> 01:27:02,301
I was told by Miss Morton, a friend,
he is to be married this month...

1206
01:27:02,580 --> 01:27:05,601
to a Miss Grey with £50,000:

1207
01:27:06,651 --> 01:27:09,740
Said I, "If 'tis true,
he is a good-for-nothing...

1208
01:27:09,854 --> 01:27:12,045
who's used my young friend
abominably ill...

1209
01:27:12,156 --> 01:27:14,813
and I wish with all my soul
that his wife...

1210
01:27:14,926 --> 01:27:17,014
might plague his heart out."

1211
01:27:17,962 --> 01:27:20,118
Oh, my dear.

1212
01:27:20,231 --> 01:27:22,888
He's not the only young man
worth having.

1213
01:27:23,001 --> 01:27:27,558
With your pretty face,
you'll never want for admirers.

1214
01:27:28,840 --> 01:27:30,166
There.

1215
01:27:30,275 --> 01:27:33,637
Better let her have her cry out
and have done with it.

1216
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:38,235
I will go look out something
to tempt her.

1217
01:27:40,151 --> 01:27:42,046
Does she care for olives?

1218
01:27:43,988 --> 01:27:45,849
I cannot tell you.

1219
01:27:53,298 --> 01:27:56,251
Apparently, they never were engaged.

1220
01:27:56,367 --> 01:28:00,705
Miss Grey has £50,000.
Marianne is virtually penniless.

1221
01:28:00,805 --> 01:28:03,792
She cannot have expected him
to go through with it.

1222
01:28:03,908 --> 01:28:06,895
But I feel for Marianne.
She will lose her bloom...

1223
01:28:07,011 --> 01:28:08,940
and end a spinster, like Elinor.

1224
01:28:11,349 --> 01:28:14,108
I think we might consider having them
stay with us for a few days.

1225
01:28:14,218 --> 01:28:19,048
- We are, after all, family. My father...
- My love.

1226
01:28:19,157 --> 01:28:23,077
I would ask them
with all my heart, but...

1227
01:28:23,194 --> 01:28:25,248
I've already asked Miss Steele
for a visit.

1228
01:28:26,364 --> 01:28:30,735
We cannot deprive Mrs. Jennings
of all her company at once.

1229
01:28:30,835 --> 01:28:33,993
We can invite your sisters
some other year, you know.

1230
01:28:34,105 --> 01:28:37,832
Miss Steele will profit far more
from your generosity.

1231
01:28:37,942 --> 01:28:41,634
- Poor girl.
- Excellent notion.

1232
01:28:46,617 --> 01:28:49,046
Colonel Brandon to see you,
Miss Dashwood.

1233
01:28:49,954 --> 01:28:52,042
Colonel.

1234
01:28:52,156 --> 01:28:54,608
Thank you so much for coming.

1235
01:28:55,727 --> 01:28:57,155
How is your sister?

1236
01:28:57,261 --> 01:28:59,656
I must get her home
as quickly as possible.

1237
01:28:59,764 --> 01:29:04,869
The Palmers can take us to their home,
which is but a day from Barton.

1238
01:29:04,969 --> 01:29:08,525
Permit me to accompany you and take you
straight on from Cleveland to Barton.

1239
01:29:08,639 --> 01:29:12,036
I confess that is precisely
what I had hoped for.

1240
01:29:13,144 --> 01:29:14,800
Marianne suffers cruelly.

1241
01:29:16,814 --> 01:29:18,709
What pains me most
is how hard she tries...

1242
01:29:18,816 --> 01:29:22,975
to justify Mr. Willoughby,
but you know her disposition.

1243
01:29:27,392 --> 01:29:30,880
Perhaps... I...

1244
01:29:32,130 --> 01:29:33,752
Would you allow me...

1245
01:29:33,865 --> 01:29:38,229
to relate some circumstances which
nothing but a desire of being useful...

1246
01:29:38,336 --> 01:29:41,289
You have something to tell me
of Mr. Willoughby?

1247
01:29:52,150 --> 01:29:53,772
When I quitted Barton last...

1248
01:29:56,054 --> 01:29:58,677
No, I must go further back.

1249
01:29:59,824 --> 01:30:01,275
No doubt...

1250
01:30:03,194 --> 01:30:06,283
No doubt, Mrs. Jennings
has apprised you...

1251
01:30:06,397 --> 01:30:09,816
of certain events in my past.

1252
01:30:09,934 --> 01:30:13,729
The sad outcome of my connection
with a young woman named Eliza.

1253
01:30:18,242 --> 01:30:21,980
What is not commonly known is that...

1254
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:26,740
twenty years ago, before she died,
Eliza bore an illegitimate child.

1255
01:30:28,352 --> 01:30:31,373
The father, whoever he was,
abandoned them.

1256
01:30:32,723 --> 01:30:35,593
As Eliza lay dying...

1257
01:30:35,693 --> 01:30:38,885
she begged me to look after the child.

1258
01:30:38,996 --> 01:30:40,948
I had failed Eliza in every other way.

1259
01:30:41,065 --> 01:30:44,621
I could not refuse her now.

1260
01:30:44,735 --> 01:30:48,132
I took the child... Beth is her name...

1261
01:30:48,239 --> 01:30:52,864
and placed her with a family in the
country where she would be looked after.

1262
01:30:52,977 --> 01:30:54,735
I saw her whenever I could.

1263
01:30:55,713 --> 01:31:00,441
She grew up so headstrong,
and God forgive me...

1264
01:31:00,651 --> 01:31:04,070
I indulged her,
I allowed her too much freedom.

1265
01:31:05,857 --> 01:31:07,979
Almost a year ago, she disappeared.

1266
01:31:08,092 --> 01:31:10,695
- Disappeared?
- I instigated a search.

1267
01:31:10,795 --> 01:31:13,953
But for eight months
I was left to imagine the worst.

1268
01:31:14,065 --> 01:31:16,756
At last, on the day
of the Delaford picnic...

1269
01:31:16,868 --> 01:31:19,957
I received the first news of her.

1270
01:31:21,172 --> 01:31:23,931
She was with child.

1271
01:31:25,977 --> 01:31:31,638
And the blackguard who had left her
with no hint of his whereabouts...

1272
01:31:32,884 --> 01:31:34,779
Oh, good God.

1273
01:31:37,855 --> 01:31:39,613
Do you mean Willoughby?

1274
01:31:43,427 --> 01:31:45,356
Before I could confront him...

1275
01:31:45,463 --> 01:31:49,383
Lady Allen had learned of his behaviour
and turned him from the house.

1276
01:31:49,667 --> 01:31:54,361
- He fled to London.
- He left us without any explanation.

1277
01:31:54,472 --> 01:31:57,664
Lady Allen had annulled his legacy.
He was left with next to nothing...

1278
01:31:57,775 --> 01:31:59,844
and in danger of losing Combe Magna...

1279
01:31:59,944 --> 01:32:01,998
and all the money that remained
to his debtors.

1280
01:32:03,214 --> 01:32:06,110
So he abandoned Marianne...

1281
01:32:06,217 --> 01:32:09,045
for Miss Grey and her £50,000.

1282
01:32:13,791 --> 01:32:16,220
Is Beth still in town?

1283
01:32:17,128 --> 01:32:20,183
She has chosen to return to the country
for her confinement.

1284
01:32:28,272 --> 01:32:30,997
I would not have burdened you,
Miss Dashwood...

1285
01:32:31,108 --> 01:32:35,267
had I not, from my heart believed
it might in time...

1286
01:32:35,379 --> 01:32:38,673
lessen your sister's regrets.

1287
01:32:48,659 --> 01:32:50,895
I have described Mr. Willoughby...

1288
01:32:50,995 --> 01:32:54,599
as the worst of libertines.

1289
01:32:54,699 --> 01:32:56,601
But I have learned from Lady Allen...

1290
01:32:56,701 --> 01:33:00,325
that he did mean to propose
that day, and therefore...

1291
01:33:01,372 --> 01:33:04,666
I cannot deny that his intentions
towards Marianne...

1292
01:33:04,775 --> 01:33:07,796
were honorable, and...

1293
01:33:10,214 --> 01:33:15,135
I feel certain that he would have
married her...

1294
01:33:15,253 --> 01:33:16,772
had it not been...

1295
01:33:17,421 --> 01:33:19,680
For the money.

1296
01:33:25,062 --> 01:33:27,932
Dearest, was I right to tell you?

1297
01:33:28,032 --> 01:33:29,961
Of course.

1298
01:33:32,870 --> 01:33:35,231
Whatever his past actions...

1299
01:33:35,339 --> 01:33:37,393
whatever his present course...

1300
01:33:37,675 --> 01:33:40,161
at least you may be certain
that he loved you.

1301
01:33:42,680 --> 01:33:44,404
But not enough.

1302
01:33:57,261 --> 01:34:00,885
Here is someone to cheer you up,
Miss Dashwood.

1303
01:34:03,901 --> 01:34:08,561
Oh, how is your dear sister,
Miss Dashwood?

1304
01:34:08,673 --> 01:34:10,575
Poor thing.

1305
01:34:10,675 --> 01:34:15,630
I do not know what I should do if a man
treated me with so little respect.

1306
01:34:15,746 --> 01:34:18,870
How are you enjoying your stay
with John and Fanny, Miss Steele?

1307
01:34:18,983 --> 01:34:21,913
I was never so happy in my entire life,
Miss Dashwood.

1308
01:34:22,019 --> 01:34:25,211
I believe your sister-in-law
has taken quite a fancy to me.

1309
01:34:25,323 --> 01:34:29,311
I had to come, for you cannot imagine
what has happened.

1310
01:34:29,427 --> 01:34:31,618
- No, I cannot.
- Yesterday...

1311
01:34:31,729 --> 01:34:35,148
I was introduced to Edward's mother:

1312
01:34:35,266 --> 01:34:37,889
She was a vast deal more than civil.

1313
01:34:38,002 --> 01:34:41,831
I have not yet seen Edward,
but I feel sure to very soon.

1314
01:34:42,740 --> 01:34:44,066
Come in.

1315
01:34:47,178 --> 01:34:50,404
There's a Mr. Edward Ferrars
to see you, Miss Dashwood.

1316
01:34:55,786 --> 01:34:58,716
Do ask him to come in.

1317
01:35:03,894 --> 01:35:05,345
This way, sir.

1318
01:35:33,924 --> 01:35:35,860
What a pleasure to see you.

1319
01:35:35,960 --> 01:35:38,754
- Miss Dashwood, how can I...
- You know Miss Steele, of course.

1320
01:35:44,902 --> 01:35:47,938
Indeed. How do you do, Miss Steele?

1321
01:35:48,038 --> 01:35:50,593
I am well, thank you, Mr. Ferrars.

1322
01:35:52,943 --> 01:35:54,394
Do sit down.

1323
01:36:02,052 --> 01:36:04,038
You must be surprised to find me here.

1324
01:36:04,155 --> 01:36:07,882
I expect you thought
I was at your sister's house.

1325
01:36:09,760 --> 01:36:12,690
Let me fetch Marianne.

1326
01:36:12,797 --> 01:36:14,885
She would be most disappointed
to miss you.

1327
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,725
Edward! I heard your voice.

1328
01:36:19,937 --> 01:36:23,129
- At last you found us.
- Forgive me, Marianne.

1329
01:36:23,240 --> 01:36:27,228
My visit is shamefully overdue.
You're pale!

1330
01:36:27,344 --> 01:36:29,296
You've not been unwell, I hope.

1331
01:36:29,413 --> 01:36:32,969
Do not think of me.
Elinor is well, you see.

1332
01:36:33,083 --> 01:36:35,672
That must be enough for both of us.

1333
01:36:35,786 --> 01:36:39,183
Indeed. And how do you enjoy London,
Miss Marianne?

1334
01:36:39,290 --> 01:36:43,153
Not at all. The sight of you
is all the pleasure it has afforded.

1335
01:36:43,260 --> 01:36:45,155
Is that not so, Elinor?

1336
01:36:48,132 --> 01:36:49,958
Why have you not come before?

1337
01:36:50,067 --> 01:36:53,020
I have been much engaged elsewhere.

1338
01:36:53,137 --> 01:36:55,396
Engaged elsewhere?

1339
01:36:55,673 --> 01:36:57,932
But what was that when there were
such friends to be met?

1340
01:36:58,042 --> 01:37:01,632
Perhaps you think young men never honor
their engagements, little or great.

1341
01:37:01,745 --> 01:37:03,105
No, indeed.

1342
01:37:03,280 --> 01:37:05,200
Edward is the most incapable
of being selfish...

1343
01:37:05,316 --> 01:37:08,337
of anyone I ever saw.

1344
01:37:11,088 --> 01:37:13,824
Edward, will you not sit?

1345
01:37:13,924 --> 01:37:16,217
Elinor, help me to persuade him.

1346
01:37:25,769 --> 01:37:27,905
Forgive me. I must take my leave.

1347
01:37:28,005 --> 01:37:30,935
- You've only just arrived.
- If you would excuse me...

1348
01:37:31,909 --> 01:37:34,338
I have an urgent commission
to attend to on Fanny's behalf.

1349
01:37:34,612 --> 01:37:38,805
In that case, perhaps you might
escort me back to your sister's house.

1350
01:37:41,986 --> 01:37:43,881
It would be an honour.

1351
01:38:04,275 --> 01:38:07,569
Why did you not urge him to stay?

1352
01:38:07,678 --> 01:38:10,540
He must have had his reasons for going.

1353
01:38:10,648 --> 01:38:13,169
His reason was, no doubt, your coldness!

1354
01:38:13,284 --> 01:38:16,237
If I were Edward, I would assume
you did not care for me at all.

1355
01:38:21,091 --> 01:38:25,682
Poor Miss Marianne looked very badly
the other day. If frightens me...

1356
01:38:25,796 --> 01:38:27,865
to think that I shall never marry.

1357
01:38:27,965 --> 01:38:31,657
Nonsense. You will marry far better
than either of the Dashwood girls.

1358
01:38:33,070 --> 01:38:36,273
But I have no dowry.

1359
01:38:36,373 --> 01:38:38,928
There are qualities
which will always make up for that...

1360
01:38:39,043 --> 01:38:41,131
and you have them in abundance.

1361
01:38:42,246 --> 01:38:45,176
It would not surprise me
if you were to marry far and away...

1362
01:38:45,282 --> 01:38:47,184
beyond your expectations.

1363
01:38:47,284 --> 01:38:49,372
I wish that might be so.

1364
01:38:52,256 --> 01:38:55,584
There is a young man.

1365
01:38:55,693 --> 01:38:58,214
Aha. I'm glad to hear of it.

1366
01:38:58,329 --> 01:39:00,698
Is he of good fortune and breeding?

1367
01:39:00,798 --> 01:39:02,727
Of both.

1368
01:39:02,833 --> 01:39:06,525
But his family would certainly
oppose the match.

1369
01:39:06,637 --> 01:39:10,261
Tush. They will allow it
as soon as they see you, my dear.

1370
01:39:11,375 --> 01:39:14,601
It is a very great secret.

1371
01:39:14,712 --> 01:39:16,614
I've told nobody in the world...

1372
01:39:16,714 --> 01:39:18,666
for fear of discovery.

1373
01:39:19,817 --> 01:39:22,770
I am the soul of discretion.

1374
01:39:23,887 --> 01:39:26,180
If I dared tell...

1375
01:39:27,992 --> 01:39:32,014
I can assure you,
I am as silent as the grave.

1376
01:39:37,234 --> 01:39:39,891
It's your brother Edward.

1377
01:39:40,004 --> 01:39:42,365
Viper in my bosom:

1378
01:39:42,640 --> 01:39:44,364
Get out:

1379
01:39:46,944 --> 01:39:48,839
Stop this!

1380
01:40:05,663 --> 01:40:08,388
Oh, my dears. What a commotion:

1381
01:40:08,666 --> 01:40:13,064
Mr. Edward Ferrars,
the very one I used to joke you about...

1382
01:40:13,170 --> 01:40:14,928
is engaged these five years...

1383
01:40:15,039 --> 01:40:17,093
to Lucy Steele.

1384
01:40:17,207 --> 01:40:19,159
Poor Mr. Ferrars. His mother...

1385
01:40:19,276 --> 01:40:21,312
who by all accounts is very proud...

1386
01:40:21,412 --> 01:40:25,901
has demanded that he break the
engagement on pain of disinheritance.

1387
01:40:26,016 --> 01:40:29,107
But he has refused
to break his promise to Lucy.

1388
01:40:29,219 --> 01:40:31,740
He has stood by her, good man...

1389
01:40:31,855 --> 01:40:33,613
and is cut off without a penny.

1390
01:40:33,724 --> 01:40:37,246
She has settled it all
irrevocably on Mr. Robert.

1391
01:40:37,361 --> 01:40:40,764
But I cannot stop. I must go to Lucy.
Your sister-in-law...

1392
01:40:40,864 --> 01:40:44,317
scolded her like any fury,
drove her to hysteria.

1393
01:40:46,236 --> 01:40:47,892
How long have you known?

1394
01:40:48,005 --> 01:40:50,901
Pigeon, I need the carriage
this instant!

1395
01:40:52,743 --> 01:40:55,400
Since the night Mrs. Jennings
offered to take us to London.

1396
01:40:55,679 --> 01:40:57,938
Why did you not tell me?

1397
01:40:58,048 --> 01:41:01,172
Lucy told me in strictest confidence.

1398
01:41:02,419 --> 01:41:05,247
- I could not break my word.
- But Edward loves you.

1399
01:41:05,355 --> 01:41:08,692
He made me no promises.
He tried to tell me about Lucy.

1400
01:41:08,792 --> 01:41:10,880
He cannot marry her.

1401
01:41:12,062 --> 01:41:14,685
Would you have him treat her even worse
than Willoughby has treated you?

1402
01:41:16,900 --> 01:41:19,125
But nor would I have him marry
where he does not love.

1403
01:41:19,236 --> 01:41:20,938
Edward made his promise long ago...

1404
01:41:21,038 --> 01:41:23,627
long before he met me.

1405
01:41:23,741 --> 01:41:25,932
Though he may harbor some regret...

1406
01:41:26,043 --> 01:41:28,996
I believe that he will be happy
in the knowledge...

1407
01:41:29,113 --> 01:41:32,202
that he kept his word.

1408
01:41:32,316 --> 01:41:36,839
After all that is bewitching...

1409
01:41:36,954 --> 01:41:41,225
in the idea of one's happiness
entirely depending on one person...

1410
01:41:41,325 --> 01:41:44,778
it is not always possible,
we must accept.

1411
01:41:45,796 --> 01:41:48,351
Edward will marry Lucy...

1412
01:41:48,465 --> 01:41:51,268
and you and I will go home.

1413
01:41:51,368 --> 01:41:54,389
Always resignation and acceptance.

1414
01:41:55,139 --> 01:41:58,934
Always prudence and honour and duty.

1415
01:41:59,042 --> 01:42:01,028
Elinor, where is your heart?

1416
01:42:02,846 --> 01:42:04,832
What do you know of my heart?

1417
01:42:04,948 --> 01:42:07,651
What do you know of anything
but your own suffering?

1418
01:42:07,751 --> 01:42:09,907
For weeks, Marianne,
I've had this pressing on me...

1419
01:42:10,020 --> 01:42:12,950
without being at liberty
to speak of it to a single creature.

1420
01:42:13,056 --> 01:42:17,249
It was forced on me by the very person
whose prior claims...

1421
01:42:17,361 --> 01:42:20,086
ruined all my hope.

1422
01:42:20,197 --> 01:42:22,626
I have endured her exaltation
again and again...

1423
01:42:22,733 --> 01:42:25,128
whilst knowing myself to be divided
from Edward forever.

1424
01:42:25,235 --> 01:42:27,255
Believe me, Marianne,
had I not been bound to silence...

1425
01:42:27,371 --> 01:42:31,200
I could have produced proof enough
of a broken heart even for you.

1426
01:42:58,302 --> 01:43:00,891
I have heard that
owing to his engagement...

1427
01:43:01,004 --> 01:43:05,868
your friend Mr. Ferrars has lost
his fortune Irrevocably to his brother.

1428
01:43:05,976 --> 01:43:08,701
Have I been rightly informed? Is it so?

1429
01:43:08,812 --> 01:43:11,970
It is indeed so.

1430
01:43:12,082 --> 01:43:14,375
Are you acquainted with Mr. Ferrars?

1431
01:43:15,619 --> 01:43:17,844
No, we have never met.

1432
01:43:19,823 --> 01:43:22,912
But I know only too well the cruelty...

1433
01:43:23,861 --> 01:43:25,312
the impolitic cruelty...

1434
01:43:25,429 --> 01:43:29,383
of dividing two young people
long attached to one another.

1435
01:43:33,070 --> 01:43:35,056
I have a proposal to make...

1436
01:43:35,172 --> 01:43:37,658
that should enable him to marry
Miss Steele immediately.

1437
01:43:39,710 --> 01:43:42,162
Since the gentleman
is close to your family...

1438
01:43:42,279 --> 01:43:44,401
perhaps you would be good enough
to mention it to him.

1439
01:43:49,019 --> 01:43:51,355
Colonel, I am sure he would be
only too delighted...

1440
01:43:51,455 --> 01:43:53,714
to hear it from your own lips.

1441
01:43:55,359 --> 01:43:56,912
I think not.

1442
01:43:58,295 --> 01:44:00,952
His behaviour has proved him proud.

1443
01:44:01,814 --> 01:44:04,335
In the best sense.

1444
01:44:06,670 --> 01:44:09,191
I feel certain this is the right course.

1445
01:44:16,013 --> 01:44:17,965
Mr. Edward Ferrars.

1446
01:44:29,059 --> 01:44:32,046
Thank you for responding
so promptly to my message.

1447
01:44:32,162 --> 01:44:34,648
I was most grateful to receive it.

1448
01:44:36,300 --> 01:44:40,322
God knows what you must think of me.
I have no right to speak, I know.

1449
01:44:40,437 --> 01:44:44,664
I have... I have good news.

1450
01:44:44,775 --> 01:44:46,260
Do please sit down.

1451
01:44:52,916 --> 01:44:57,007
I think you know of our friend
Colonel Brandon.

1452
01:44:57,120 --> 01:45:00,915
- Yes, I've heard his name.
- Colonel Brandon desires me to say...

1453
01:45:01,024 --> 01:45:04,546
that understanding
you wish to join the clergy...

1454
01:45:04,661 --> 01:45:07,750
he has great pleasure
in offering you the parish...

1455
01:45:07,864 --> 01:45:10,033
on his estate at Delaford...

1456
01:45:10,133 --> 01:45:13,029
in the hope that it may enable
you and Miss Steele to marry.

1457
01:45:16,640 --> 01:45:18,364
Colonel Brandon?

1458
01:45:20,143 --> 01:45:25,303
He is concerned for the cruel situation
in which you now find yourselves.

1459
01:45:28,952 --> 01:45:30,938
Colonel Brandon give me a parish?

1460
01:45:33,256 --> 01:45:35,151
Can it be possible?

1461
01:45:37,194 --> 01:45:41,285
The unkindness of your family makes you
astonished to find friendship elsewhere.

1462
01:45:47,037 --> 01:45:49,865
Not to find it in you.

1463
01:45:49,973 --> 01:45:53,165
I cannot be ignorant that it is
certainly to you that I owe this.

1464
01:45:53,276 --> 01:45:55,262
I'd... I feel it.

1465
01:45:55,379 --> 01:45:59,140
I would express it if I could,
but, as you know, I am no orator.

1466
01:45:59,249 --> 01:46:02,941
You are mistaken. You owe it
almost entirely to your own merit.

1467
01:46:03,053 --> 01:46:04,948
I've had no hand in it.

1468
01:46:09,926 --> 01:46:13,618
Colonel Brandon must be a man
of great worth and respectability.

1469
01:46:13,730 --> 01:46:16,057
Yes, he is the kindest and best of men.

1470
01:46:21,004 --> 01:46:25,026
May I ask why the colonel
did not tell me himself?

1471
01:46:26,376 --> 01:46:30,296
I think he felt it would be better
coming from a friend.

1472
01:46:36,887 --> 01:46:39,248
Your friendship has been
the most important of my life.

1473
01:46:45,662 --> 01:46:47,386
You will always have it.

1474
01:46:53,036 --> 01:46:54,931
Forgive me.

1475
01:46:56,640 --> 01:47:01,538
You honour your promises. That is
more important than anything else.

1476
01:47:01,645 --> 01:47:03,540
I...

1477
01:47:03,647 --> 01:47:06,668
I wish you both very happy.

1478
01:47:12,789 --> 01:47:14,718
Miss Dashwood.

1479
01:47:45,989 --> 01:47:50,148
What a stroke of luck for Lucy and
Edward to find a parish close to Barton!

1480
01:47:50,260 --> 01:47:55,318
We'll meet very often.
That will cheer you up, Miss Marianne.

1481
01:47:55,432 --> 01:47:59,727
I have never disliked a person so much
as Mr. Willoughby. Insufferable man!

1482
01:47:59,836 --> 01:48:02,698
To think we can see
his insufferable house from our hill!

1483
01:48:03,807 --> 01:48:07,226
I shall ask Jackson to plant
some very tall trees.

1484
01:48:07,344 --> 01:48:09,579
You will do nothing of the sort.

1485
01:48:09,679 --> 01:48:13,701
I hear Miss Grey's bridal gown
was everything of the finest.

1486
01:48:13,817 --> 01:48:15,712
Made in Paris, no less.

1487
01:48:25,795 --> 01:48:29,920
Oh, Mrs. Bunting:
We're in desperate need of tea!

1488
01:48:30,033 --> 01:48:32,554
- Thank you, Colonel.
- Mrs. Bunting, I am glad to see you.

1489
01:48:32,669 --> 01:48:35,360
What a journey we've had.
My bones are rattling still.

1490
01:48:35,639 --> 01:48:40,094
- How goes things?
- Very well.

1491
01:48:40,210 --> 01:48:43,004
I do not think she drew breath
from the moment we left London.

1492
01:48:43,113 --> 01:48:47,841
- I should have found another way.
- There was no other way.

1493
01:48:47,951 --> 01:48:51,609
But I will take a stroll.
A moment's peace, Elinor.

1494
01:48:51,721 --> 01:48:55,618
- I think it is going to rain.
- Miss Dashwood! Come and have some tea:

1495
01:48:55,725 --> 01:48:58,780
- It will not rain.
- You always say that, and then it does.

1496
01:48:59,729 --> 01:49:02,591
I shall keep to the garden,
near the house.

1497
01:49:07,003 --> 01:49:09,262
How can you say such a thing?

1498
01:49:22,219 --> 01:49:24,988
We're very proud
of our little Thomas, Colonel.

1499
01:49:25,088 --> 01:49:28,143
His papa has such a way with him.

1500
01:49:28,258 --> 01:49:33,179
I have seldom seen a father take to
a child so. Do not fear, Mrs. Bunting.

1501
01:49:41,738 --> 01:49:45,609
Hush: Oh, there you are, Miss Dashwood.

1502
01:49:45,709 --> 01:49:47,797
Come and meet little Thomas.

1503
01:50:04,728 --> 01:50:06,623
I cannot see Marianne.

1504
01:50:08,098 --> 01:50:09,993
Oh, there.

1505
01:50:46,403 --> 01:50:48,798
"Love is not love...

1506
01:50:48,905 --> 01:50:52,302
which alters when it alteration finds...

1507
01:50:53,410 --> 01:50:56,306
or bends with the remover to remove.

1508
01:50:58,748 --> 01:51:00,108
Oh, no.

1509
01:51:00,216 --> 01:51:04,020
It is an ever-fixed mark...

1510
01:51:04,120 --> 01:51:06,276
that looks on tempests...

1511
01:51:06,389 --> 01:51:09,012
and is never shaken."

1512
01:51:28,011 --> 01:51:31,147
She'll be wet through when she returns.

1513
01:51:31,247 --> 01:51:33,733
Thank you for pointing that out,
my dear.

1514
01:51:34,951 --> 01:51:38,855
Do not worry, Miss Dashwood.
Brandon will find her.

1515
01:51:38,955 --> 01:51:41,248
I think we can all guess where she went.

1516
01:51:52,168 --> 01:51:54,063
Oh, thank you.

1517
01:52:12,622 --> 01:52:15,313
She's not hurt,
but we must get her warm.

1518
01:52:17,360 --> 01:52:20,882
- Charlotte.
- The fire is lit in my room. Do hurry.

1519
01:52:23,066 --> 01:52:25,188
Higgins, fetch us some blankets.

1520
01:52:25,301 --> 01:52:27,059
And brandy.

1521
01:52:49,826 --> 01:52:52,221
I think Marianne may need a doctor.

1522
01:53:13,082 --> 01:53:15,944
You'll wear yourself out, Colonel.

1523
01:53:16,052 --> 01:53:19,949
Do not worry. A day or two in bed
will soon set her to rights.

1524
01:53:20,056 --> 01:53:23,350
You can rely upon Harris, Colonel.
I've never found a better physician.

1525
01:53:26,896 --> 01:53:29,883
- What is the diagnosis?
- It is an infectious fever...

1526
01:53:29,999 --> 01:53:31,587
that has taken far more serious hold...

1527
01:53:31,701 --> 01:53:34,096
than I would have expected
in one so young.

1528
01:53:34,204 --> 01:53:38,033
I would recommend the hasty removal
of your child, Mrs. Palmer.

1529
01:53:38,141 --> 01:53:40,400
Mrs. Bunting:

1530
01:53:48,351 --> 01:53:51,611
My dear Miss Dashwood.

1531
01:53:51,721 --> 01:53:54,150
I am more sorry than I can say.

1532
01:53:54,257 --> 01:53:56,760
If you would prefer me to stay,
I am at your service.

1533
01:53:56,860 --> 01:54:01,690
Mr. Palmer, that is very kind,
but Colonel Brandon...

1534
01:54:01,798 --> 01:54:04,660
and Dr. Harris will look after us.

1535
01:54:04,767 --> 01:54:07,026
Thank you for everything you have done.

1536
01:54:36,633 --> 01:54:38,926
She is not doing as well
as I would like.

1537
01:54:54,450 --> 01:54:56,379
What can I do?

1538
01:54:59,055 --> 01:55:00,881
Colonel, you have done so much already.

1539
01:55:00,990 --> 01:55:05,547
Give me an occupation, Miss Dashwood,
or I shall run mad.

1540
01:55:05,662 --> 01:55:07,921
She would be easier
if her mother were here.

1541
01:55:09,966 --> 01:55:11,588
Of course.

1542
01:55:54,644 --> 01:55:56,232
I must fetch more laudanum.

1543
01:55:57,347 --> 01:56:02,007
I cannot pretend that your sister's
condition is not very serious.

1544
01:56:08,925 --> 01:56:11,013
You must prepare yourself.

1545
01:56:12,228 --> 01:56:14,123
I will return very shortly.

1546
01:56:35,118 --> 01:56:37,047
Marianne, please try.

1547
01:57:00,309 --> 01:57:02,830
I cannot...

1548
01:57:02,945 --> 01:57:05,841
I cannot do without you.

1549
01:57:08,951 --> 01:57:10,846
Oh, please.

1550
01:57:13,589 --> 01:57:16,542
I have tried to bear everything else.

1551
01:57:16,659 --> 01:57:18,554
I will try.

1552
01:57:20,296 --> 01:57:23,055
Please, dearest.

1553
01:57:28,271 --> 01:57:30,166
Beloved Marianne.

1554
01:57:34,944 --> 01:57:36,839
Do not leave me alone.

1555
01:59:01,597 --> 01:59:03,025
My mother.

1556
01:59:12,809 --> 01:59:15,568
She is out of danger.

1557
01:59:21,918 --> 01:59:24,643
Oh, there, there, my love.

1558
01:59:24,754 --> 01:59:27,582
Oh, my Marianne.

1559
01:59:30,059 --> 01:59:32,989
- Where is Elinor?
- I'm here.

1560
01:59:33,095 --> 01:59:34,990
Dearest, I am here.

1561
01:59:41,170 --> 01:59:42,928
Colonel Brandon.

1562
01:59:50,613 --> 01:59:52,064
Thank you.

1563
02:00:20,710 --> 02:00:22,605
"Or weigh the thought...

1564
02:00:26,215 --> 02:00:31,011
But if the weight of these thou canst
not show, weigh but one word...

1565
02:00:31,120 --> 02:00:33,948
which from thy lips doth fall."

1566
02:00:35,858 --> 02:00:38,151
He certainly is not so dashing
as Willoughby...

1567
02:00:38,261 --> 02:00:41,123
but he has
a far more pleasing countenance.

1568
02:00:42,365 --> 02:00:46,023
There was something, if you remember,
in Willoughby's eyes at times...

1569
02:00:46,135 --> 02:00:48,030
that I did not like.

1570
02:00:50,106 --> 02:00:52,262
"It is no more at all.

1571
02:00:52,375 --> 02:00:56,397
Nor is the earth the lesse,
or loseth aught.

1572
02:00:56,679 --> 02:01:00,201
For whatsoever from one place
doth fall...

1573
02:01:00,316 --> 02:01:03,269
is with the tide unto another brought.

1574
02:01:05,254 --> 02:01:08,013
For there is nothing lost...

1575
02:01:08,124 --> 02:01:10,053
that may be found...

1576
02:01:11,394 --> 02:01:13,289
if sought."

1577
02:01:18,834 --> 02:01:20,990
Shall we continue tomorrow?

1578
02:01:21,103 --> 02:01:23,794
No, for I must away.

1579
02:01:23,906 --> 02:01:25,960
Away? Where?

1580
02:01:27,243 --> 02:01:30,037
That I cannot tell you.

1581
02:01:30,146 --> 02:01:31,768
It is a secret.

1582
02:01:36,385 --> 02:01:38,644
You will not stay away long?

1583
02:01:56,872 --> 02:01:58,323
There.

1584
02:02:00,843 --> 02:02:03,739
There I fell, and there
I first saw Willoughby.

1585
02:02:06,983 --> 02:02:09,879
Poor Willoughby.
He will always regret you.

1586
02:02:11,721 --> 02:02:15,618
But does it follow that having chosen me
he would have been content?

1587
02:02:17,426 --> 02:02:20,322
He would've had a wife he loved
but no money...

1588
02:02:22,164 --> 02:02:25,219
and might soon have learned to rank
the demands of his pocketbook...

1589
02:02:25,334 --> 02:02:27,957
far above the demands of his heart.

1590
02:02:32,274 --> 02:02:36,262
If his present regrets are half as
painful as mine, he will suffer enough.

1591
02:02:37,947 --> 02:02:40,206
Do you compare your conduct with his?

1592
02:02:43,819 --> 02:02:46,248
I compare it
with what it ought to have been.

1593
02:02:47,823 --> 02:02:50,685
I compare it with yours.

1594
02:03:02,238 --> 02:03:05,726
- Oh, Thomas.
- I fetched those beef fillets for you.

1595
02:03:07,410 --> 02:03:09,805
Beef is far less expensive in Exeter.

1596
02:03:09,912 --> 02:03:13,365
- Anyway, it's for Marianne.
- Thank you.

1597
02:03:13,649 --> 02:03:15,985
- Was Exeter crowded?
- It was indeed.

1598
02:03:16,085 --> 02:03:19,880
I spoke to Mrs. Braintree. She told me
Miss Pothington's had another stroke.

1599
02:03:21,023 --> 02:03:23,043
She has no sense or feeling.

1600
02:03:23,159 --> 02:03:27,216
Miss Murden has been obliged to turn
away Coles for his drunkenness.

1601
02:03:27,329 --> 02:03:30,782
Oh, and Mr. Ferrars is married,
but you know that.

1602
02:03:30,900 --> 02:03:32,658
But, Elinor, I Th...

1603
02:03:36,372 --> 02:03:39,200
Who told you that Mr. Ferrars
was married?

1604
02:03:39,308 --> 02:03:41,294
I seen Mrs. Ferrars myself:

1605
02:03:41,410 --> 02:03:43,862
Miss Lucy Steele as was.

1606
02:03:43,979 --> 02:03:47,239
She and Mr. Ferrars were stopping
in a chaise at the New London Inn.

1607
02:03:47,349 --> 02:03:50,006
I looked up as I passed by,
and I see it was Miss Steele...

1608
02:03:50,119 --> 02:03:51,911
so I took off my hat.

1609
02:03:52,021 --> 02:03:55,042
She inquired after you, ma'am,
and all you young ladies...

1610
02:03:55,157 --> 02:03:56,949
especially Miss Dashwood...

1611
02:03:57,059 --> 02:04:01,354
and begged me to give you
her and Mr. Ferrars' best compliments...

1612
02:04:01,630 --> 02:04:03,923
and how they'd send you
a piece of the cake.

1613
02:04:06,268 --> 02:04:09,995
- Did Mrs. Ferrars seem well?
- Oh, yes.

1614
02:04:10,106 --> 02:04:13,275
She was vastly contented, and since she
was always a very affable young lady...

1615
02:04:13,375 --> 02:04:15,930
I made free to wish her joy.

1616
02:04:17,313 --> 02:04:19,208
Thank you.

1617
02:04:28,858 --> 02:04:30,753
I can't...

1618
02:04:48,911 --> 02:04:50,601
It's for us:

1619
02:04:51,914 --> 02:04:56,107
- What is it?
- I'm not sure, but it's right heavy.

1620
02:04:56,785 --> 02:05:00,056
"I have found a small enough
instrument to fit the parlour.

1621
02:05:00,156 --> 02:05:03,993
I shall follow in a day or two, and I'll
expect you to have learnt the enclosed.

1622
02:05:04,093 --> 02:05:06,249
Your devoted friend,
Christopher Brandon."

1623
02:05:06,362 --> 02:05:08,621
Oh, my darling, look.

1624
02:05:08,731 --> 02:05:10,626
Oh, it fits perfectly.

1625
02:05:12,902 --> 02:05:14,660
Here you are.

1626
02:05:16,205 --> 02:05:17,895
Fetch some tea.

1627
02:05:18,807 --> 02:05:20,793
He must like you very much.

1628
02:05:20,910 --> 02:05:24,102
It is not just for me.
It is for all of us.

1629
02:05:32,788 --> 02:05:36,742
Or scorn or pity

1630
02:05:36,859 --> 02:05:39,345
On me take

1631
02:05:39,628 --> 02:05:41,352
I must

1632
02:05:41,630 --> 02:05:46,824
The true relation make

1633
02:05:46,936 --> 02:05:50,355
I am undone

1634
02:05:50,639 --> 02:05:54,593
Tonight

1635
02:05:54,710 --> 02:06:00,405
Love in a subtle dream disguised

1636
02:06:00,616 --> 02:06:05,947
Hath both my heart and me surprised

1637
02:06:08,757 --> 02:06:10,310
Whom never yet

1638
02:06:10,593 --> 02:06:13,022
He doth attempt awake

1639
02:06:13,128 --> 02:06:15,030
Here is Colonel Brandon.

1640
02:06:15,130 --> 02:06:18,083
When will he fell me

1641
02:06:18,200 --> 02:06:21,597
For whose sake

1642
02:06:26,375 --> 02:06:28,277
I don't think it is the colonel.

1643
02:06:28,377 --> 02:06:32,832
It must be. He said he would arrive today.
You must play your new song.

1644
02:06:36,952 --> 02:06:38,676
It is Edward.

1645
02:06:41,957 --> 02:06:44,318
Calm. We must be calm.

1646
02:06:47,396 --> 02:06:50,588
Edward's here. Sit down.

1647
02:06:50,699 --> 02:06:53,026
Sit. Shh. Not a word.

1648
02:06:58,140 --> 02:07:01,744
- Good afternoon, Mr. Ferrars.
- Good afternoon. Are the ladies home?

1649
02:07:01,844 --> 02:07:04,000
They are indeed. Come this way.

1650
02:07:06,815 --> 02:07:08,710
Mr. Ferrars for you.

1651
02:07:15,758 --> 02:07:17,687
What a pleasure to see you.

1652
02:07:35,077 --> 02:07:36,979
I trust I find you all well?

1653
02:07:37,079 --> 02:07:40,339
Thank you. We all are very well.

1654
02:07:46,422 --> 02:07:49,910
We've been enjoying very fine weather.

1655
02:07:50,025 --> 02:07:51,578
Well, we have.

1656
02:07:52,961 --> 02:07:57,723
Well, I'm glad to hear it.
The roads were very dry.

1657
02:08:02,905 --> 02:08:05,699
May I wish you great joy.

1658
02:08:07,676 --> 02:08:09,104
Thank you.

1659
02:08:25,594 --> 02:08:28,718
I hope you have left Mrs. Ferrars well.

1660
02:08:31,734 --> 02:08:33,993
Tolerably. Thank you.

1661
02:08:39,808 --> 02:08:42,363
Is Mrs. Ferrars at the new parish?

1662
02:08:45,180 --> 02:08:47,132
No, my mother is in town.

1663
02:08:48,417 --> 02:08:51,870
I meant to inquire after
Mrs. Edward Ferrars.

1664
02:08:55,357 --> 02:08:59,379
Well, then you... You've not heard?

1665
02:09:01,764 --> 02:09:05,559
I think you mean my brother.
You mean Mrs. Robert Ferrars.

1666
02:09:08,137 --> 02:09:10,089
Mrs. Robert Ferrars?

1667
02:09:10,873 --> 02:09:12,324
Yes.

1668
02:09:14,076 --> 02:09:15,527
I...

1669
02:09:16,645 --> 02:09:18,080
I received a letter...

1670
02:09:18,180 --> 02:09:20,803
from Miss Steele...

1671
02:09:20,916 --> 02:09:22,868
Mrs. Ferrars, I should say...

1672
02:09:24,753 --> 02:09:27,274
communicating to me...

1673
02:09:27,389 --> 02:09:32,287
the transfer of her affections
to my brother, Robert.

1674
02:09:32,394 --> 02:09:37,054
It seems they were
much thrown together in London...

1675
02:09:38,634 --> 02:09:43,225
and in view of the change
in my circumstances, I felt it...

1676
02:09:43,338 --> 02:09:47,133
only right that she be released
from our engagement.

1677
02:09:48,811 --> 02:09:52,139
At any rate, they were married
last week in Plymouth.

1678
02:09:58,020 --> 02:09:59,642
Then you...

1679
02:10:03,959 --> 02:10:05,251
are not married?

1680
02:10:40,429 --> 02:10:43,265
I met Lucy when I was very young.

1681
02:10:43,365 --> 02:10:46,420
Had I had an active profession,
I should never have felt...

1682
02:10:46,702 --> 02:10:50,139
such an idle and foolish inclination.

1683
02:10:50,239 --> 02:10:53,328
My behaviour at Norland
was very wrong...

1684
02:10:53,442 --> 02:10:57,134
but I convinced myself that you felt
only friendship for me...

1685
02:10:57,246 --> 02:11:01,007
and that it was my heart alone
that I was risking.

1686
02:11:01,283 --> 02:11:04,946
I've come here with no expectations...

1687
02:11:05,053 --> 02:11:08,211
only to profess now that
I am liberty to do so...

1688
02:11:09,424 --> 02:11:11,216
that my heart is...

1689
02:11:13,395 --> 02:11:15,290
and always will be...

1690
02:11:17,766 --> 02:11:19,592
yours.

1691
02:11:33,782 --> 02:11:35,350
He's sitting with her.

1692
02:11:35,450 --> 02:11:37,186
Come down.

1693
02:11:37,286 --> 02:11:39,875
- Will you stop that?
- What else?

1694
02:11:39,988 --> 02:11:41,644
Tell us.

1695
02:11:41,757 --> 02:11:45,176
Wait. He's kneeling down.

1696
02:13:06,308 --> 02:13:10,171
Throw the coins. Throw the coins.
