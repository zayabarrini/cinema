1
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:08,261
Don't jump in the pool.

2
00:02:08,329 --> 00:02:10,957
The water we put in next
week for the summer.

3
00:02:22,042 --> 00:02:23,907
...in South Vietnam
ground war.

4
00:02:23,978 --> 00:02:27,778
The U.S. command reports 148
Americans killed in the war last week,

5
00:02:27,848 --> 00:02:31,909
the lowest weekly figure in six months.
1,612 Americans were...

6
00:02:31,986 --> 00:02:34,181
...they barely look
like they've been warned.

7
00:02:34,255 --> 00:02:35,950
There was exchange
of fire south of

8
00:02:36,023 --> 00:02:38,287
the Sea of Galilee and
across the Suez Canal.

9
00:02:38,993 --> 00:02:42,394
These exchanges and raids are
now a daily part of Israeli life,

10
00:02:42,463 --> 00:02:44,693
and the country is
prepared for anything.

11
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:47,598
NBC news correspondent,
David Burrington, reports.

12
00:02:49,236 --> 00:02:51,295
In spite of all
the border turmoil,

13
00:02:51,372 --> 00:02:55,365
Israeli intelligence officers
do not expect all-out war this summer

14
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:57,876
unless the Arab
nations get reckless.

15
00:02:57,945 --> 00:02:59,776
And that's the
main worry here,

16
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:02,281
that Arab frustration
will suddenly explode...

17
00:03:05,119 --> 00:03:06,848
In a day
of intensive activity,

18
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,013
Captain Neil Armstrong
and his crew

19
00:03:09,089 --> 00:03:11,216
entered the final
phase of preparations

20
00:03:11,292 --> 00:03:14,227
for the July 16th
launch of Apollo 11.

21
00:03:14,762 --> 00:03:16,457
NASA officials report

22
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:19,897
that the third and final day of
launching pad tests proceeded smoothly,

23
00:03:19,967 --> 00:03:21,457
while inside
the training center,

24
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:25,437
the astronauts performed simulated
moon walks in their space suits.

25
00:03:28,042 --> 00:03:31,944
What? Excuse me.
I can't possibly stay.

26
00:03:32,012 --> 00:03:34,776
This establishment isn't
fit for human habitation.

27
00:03:34,848 --> 00:03:37,715
Fine, go. Yes, well,
here's your key.

28
00:03:37,785 --> 00:03:40,720
It didn't fit the lock,
but the door was open in any case.

29
00:03:41,455 --> 00:03:43,650
You went into the room?
I did, yes.

30
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:45,851
And now I must insist
on you returning my $8.

31
00:03:45,926 --> 00:03:48,121
After you already
used the room?

32
00:03:48,262 --> 00:03:50,457
What kind of scam
are you running?

33
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:51,896
And besides...

34
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,363
Well, this is ridiculous!

35
00:03:55,436 --> 00:03:56,960
The so-called air
conditioner was just

36
00:03:57,037 --> 00:03:58,937
an empty plastic
box in the window.

37
00:03:59,006 --> 00:04:03,102
The room was filthy. Indeed, I
discovered a small hair on the pillow.

38
00:04:03,177 --> 00:04:05,168
There wasn't even
a towel in the bathroom.

39
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,704
- Ma.
- What?

40
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:09,908
Please, we're late already.

41
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:12,918
My son,
thank God you're here.

42
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:15,511
This man is threatening me for a refund!

43
00:04:26,033 --> 00:04:29,093
I'm sorry. You're over $5,000
in arrears on the mortgage.

44
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:31,569
The home office is
breathing down my neck.

45
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:34,163
Mr. Spiers,
the El Monaco Resort...

46
00:04:34,241 --> 00:04:35,674
It's a resort now?

47
00:04:36,844 --> 00:04:39,836
...and Motel is my
parents' lifeblood.

48
00:04:39,913 --> 00:04:40,971
With the addition
of the swimming pool

49
00:04:41,048 --> 00:04:42,743
and these new town-wide
marketing initiatives...

50
00:04:42,816 --> 00:04:44,215
Initiatives?

51
00:04:45,552 --> 00:04:46,883
As you know,
I have been elected the President

52
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:48,080
of the Bethel
Chamber of Commerce.

53
00:04:48,155 --> 00:04:50,555
The youngest president
in their history.

54
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:54,321
We've decided to erect a tourist
information booth, right off 17B.

55
00:04:54,395 --> 00:04:55,657
I have agreed, on behalf
of the El Monaco,

56
00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:57,924
to lease at no cost some road
frontage to the endeavor,

57
00:04:57,998 --> 00:05:01,229
which should coincidentally drive heavy
tourist traffic right to our door.

58
00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:03,496
In addition...
Please, Elliot,

59
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,731
you know I do everything I can to help.

60
00:05:05,873 --> 00:05:08,034
We even bought one
of your paintings.

61
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:11,409
But don't try to sell me
on those singles weekends

62
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:13,537
or the culture festival
or whatever other schemes

63
00:05:13,614 --> 00:05:15,514
were supposed to dig
you out last summer.

64
00:05:15,582 --> 00:05:18,642
We've decided to go classical
with the festival this year,

65
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:21,654
maybe a string quartet,
more contemporary, like Morton Feldman?

66
00:05:21,722 --> 00:05:24,486
Very avant-garde. And we've got
a theater troupe in the barn.

67
00:05:24,558 --> 00:05:26,617
You have a theater
troupe in the barn?

68
00:05:27,895 --> 00:05:32,195
The Earthlight Players.
Vassar graduates, some of them.

69
00:05:32,266 --> 00:05:33,961
They live in the barn?

70
00:05:35,636 --> 00:05:37,126
They do everything
in the barn.

71
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:39,965
You haven't seen the sign?
What sign?

72
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,064
The sign in
front of the barn.

73
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:44,736
Mr. Spiers, my God, please.
We come here, begging,

74
00:05:44,812 --> 00:05:46,439
begging for mercy,
and what do you give us?

75
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:48,913
This fixation about the barn.
What is it with you and the barn?

76
00:05:48,982 --> 00:05:52,042
I was just... I'm an old woman,
Mr. Spiers. I've suffered.

77
00:05:52,119 --> 00:05:56,021
I walked here all the way
from Minsk, in Russia,

78
00:05:56,089 --> 00:06:00,150
in 20-foot snow drifts,
1,000 miles across Siberia.

79
00:06:00,227 --> 00:06:03,560
I escaped the pogroms,
the Tsar's secret police,

80
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:06,622
with nothing but cold
potatoes in my pockets.

81
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,134
Mrs. Teichberg, please...
And for what?

82
00:06:09,203 --> 00:06:12,297
For more persecution!
It's because we're Jewish.

83
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,897
I know it, isn't it?
Mrs. Teichberg, please.

84
00:06:14,975 --> 00:06:16,465
This is the Catskills.

85
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:19,535
Half the summer colonies are Jewish,
they're all our clients.

86
00:06:19,613 --> 00:06:23,913
Until the day they need you,
and then on goes the gas!

87
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:25,918
Ma,
calm down, please?

88
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,853
Jackson, just give us
a couple of months.

89
00:06:30,591 --> 00:06:33,458
The summer season's coming up,
I honestly do have some real money

90
00:06:33,527 --> 00:06:35,654
owed me from my interior
design business in the city.

91
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:39,793
Please?

92
00:06:41,702 --> 00:06:42,691
Please?

93
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:53,137
Mother-son ballroom class will
start immediately after, at 11:00.

94
00:06:53,213 --> 00:06:57,172
That's kinder-dancing for
the kiddies in 10 minutes.

95
00:06:57,251 --> 00:06:59,082
Dad, you gotta
get Ma to lay off

96
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:01,985
the Nazi stuff and
let me handle this.

97
00:07:02,055 --> 00:07:04,956
You think I can tell
your mother what to do?

98
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:09,492
I gotta get back to the city.
I'll see you Friday.

99
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:11,820
We'll get the money.

100
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:15,293
Let them take
this miserable dump.

101
00:07:15,369 --> 00:07:17,667
I'll die in peace,
in Florida.

102
00:07:28,148 --> 00:07:30,139
Mr. Tiber.
George.

103
00:07:30,217 --> 00:07:33,414
I admitted your sister some time ago.
Thanks.

104
00:07:33,487 --> 00:07:35,853
And some gentlemen
from the moving company.

105
00:07:35,923 --> 00:07:37,185
Oh, yeah.

106
00:07:39,927 --> 00:07:42,054
There you are.
Hi, Sis.

107
00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:48,124
How did it go
at the bank?

108
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:53,929
How do you think it went?
Till the end of the summer, that's it.

109
00:07:54,675 --> 00:07:56,302
What about the money
those mobsters owe you

110
00:07:56,376 --> 00:07:58,139
for that nightclub
you designed?

111
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:03,445
They have a surprisingly strict
policy about paying designers.

112
00:08:03,517 --> 00:08:04,882
They don't.

113
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:08,047
You want some
more paintings?

114
00:08:08,121 --> 00:08:11,420
No, I already have 10 of them.
And you know Joe hates them.

115
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:15,160
Of course you're broke,

116
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:18,459
after all the money you've sunk
into that hellhole of theirs.

117
00:08:18,532 --> 00:08:22,093
And I bet Ma's never even said
a word of thanks, has she?

118
00:08:22,636 --> 00:08:25,400
No, but I can sense it.

119
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:28,030
The special way she
sometimes looks at me

120
00:08:28,108 --> 00:08:30,542
with just her left eye,
you know.

121
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:33,608
Elliot. Now is your time

122
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,807
to go to California
like you've always wanted,

123
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:40,819
to paint and design. Be free,
stop throwing your life away up there.

124
00:08:42,222 --> 00:08:45,089
I can't give up on them now.
Why not?

125
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:47,991
I'm the one they
still want around.

126
00:08:48,128 --> 00:08:50,460
I guess that means they
love me more than you.

127
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:54,929
That must be a great
consolation to you.

128
00:09:08,081 --> 00:09:11,448
Dad, that's bleach
for laundry.

129
00:09:11,518 --> 00:09:14,419
It kills the germs.
What's the difference?

130
00:09:20,427 --> 00:09:23,555
Elli? What?
What are you doing with those sheets?

131
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:27,031
They're dirty.
Let me see. Nothing.

132
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,364
Those two, they didn't do nothing
in there. Shake them, put them back.

133
00:09:29,436 --> 00:09:31,597
But, Ma...
Electricity, detergent,

134
00:09:31,672 --> 00:09:33,731
who's paying
for all that?

135
00:09:38,211 --> 00:09:41,703
And you, theater girl,
get back in the barn!

136
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:45,350
All of you!

137
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:47,644
Lazy people.

138
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:54,087
Let's call to order.
Come on, everyone.

139
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:59,765
Last meeting, we all said we'd each
bring some new ideas to the table.

140
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:06,530
Well, okay.

141
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:11,240
We got a lot of dairy farms
around here, right?

142
00:10:11,912 --> 00:10:15,404
And a fair number of bulls.

143
00:10:15,482 --> 00:10:16,744
Okay, you've all
heard of the running

144
00:10:16,817 --> 00:10:19,183
of the bulls in
that town in Spain,

145
00:10:19,252 --> 00:10:21,550
Pampoona.
Pamplona.

146
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,851
Well, no one's doing
one in the Catskills.

147
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:26,220
Seems to be a big
draw over there.

148
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,327
It would be very amusing
to see all those Jews

149
00:10:30,397 --> 00:10:32,297
from Levitsky's
summer colony,

150
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:36,062
you know, the ones with the
black top hats and the curls,

151
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:39,572
running for their lives
chased by our local livestock.

152
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,931
Wouldn't that be
a wonderful sight!

153
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:46,735
We're writing it all down.

154
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:52,480
Any other ideas?
What about the monorail?

155
00:10:52,552 --> 00:10:54,952
Marge, you can't bring
that up in every meeting.

156
00:10:56,356 --> 00:10:57,721
I've written
to the Governor,

157
00:10:57,791 --> 00:11:00,225
but I think a letter from the
entire Chamber of Commerce

158
00:11:00,293 --> 00:11:02,318
would be much
more effective.

159
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:05,421
A monorail linking downtown
New York to White Lake

160
00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:08,229
would be a tremendous spur
to the local economy.

161
00:11:08,301 --> 00:11:10,929
Jesus. Look, people, I said I
would come back to these meetings

162
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:13,939
if you could stay out of cuckoo land,
just once.

163
00:11:14,574 --> 00:11:17,407
We have some serious local issues,
serious business to do.

164
00:11:17,477 --> 00:11:18,944
Such as?

165
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:20,546
For starters,

166
00:11:20,614 --> 00:11:22,081
I need a permit
for the town landing

167
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:24,674
for a fish-toss
tournament next month.

168
00:11:24,751 --> 00:11:28,619
I knew it. I knew it. You're just
back here for your own purposes.

169
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:32,647
Now, come on, Marge. All right,
let's see the application.

170
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:34,048
I got it here.

171
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:43,368
Yeah, that's all
in order. $1.

172
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:47,772
Here you go.

173
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:51,573
And I've got my
application for our annual

174
00:11:51,645 --> 00:11:54,079
El Monaco summer
music and art event,

175
00:11:54,147 --> 00:11:55,614
which will also inaugurate
the first season

176
00:11:55,682 --> 00:11:57,582
of the tourist
information kiosk.

177
00:11:57,651 --> 00:12:00,449
Annie, if your grandson and his
friends want to play again this year,

178
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,078
tell them to
give me a call.

179
00:12:03,356 --> 00:12:04,345
Okay.

180
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:07,586
Do I hear a motion to
approve these permits?

181
00:12:07,661 --> 00:12:10,960
I so move.
Okay. Seconded?

182
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,428
Seconded?

183
00:12:16,136 --> 00:12:18,934
Oh, for crying
out loud, seconded.

184
00:12:30,784 --> 00:12:32,251
Good night.
Good night.

185
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,384
Good night, Annie.
Night, Elliot.

186
00:12:37,891 --> 00:12:38,880
See you, Elliot.

187
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:40,415
Bye, everyone.
- Night, Elliot.

188
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:43,428
Good night, Carol. Fuck! Fuck!
Take him down, motherfuckers!

189
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:46,932
- Jesus!
- Billy, get back in the car.

190
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,161
What?
Back in the car.

191
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:54,006
Hey, Billy, you're back.
That's great.

192
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:56,431
Yeah.

193
00:12:58,178 --> 00:13:01,011
Staying with big brother Dan and
his beautiful wife Carol here

194
00:13:01,081 --> 00:13:02,241
till I get my own pad.

195
00:13:02,315 --> 00:13:03,680
Yeah, 'cause
little brother Billy

196
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,445
made a tiny little
pit stop in Bangkok

197
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:07,577
and blew all his Army pay.
Didn't he, Billy?

198
00:13:10,557 --> 00:13:14,960
Bangkok, man.
Fucking Bangkok.

199
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:17,529
Come on, we gotta go.

200
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,564
Great seeing you
back home, Billy.

201
00:13:44,357 --> 00:13:46,018
Hey, Elliot.
Dave.

202
00:13:46,092 --> 00:13:47,184
The usual?

203
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,818
Extra bacon, please.
You got it.

204
00:13:48,895 --> 00:13:50,294
Hey, Elliot.
Max.

205
00:13:50,363 --> 00:13:52,331
I hear you've moved
up here permanently.

206
00:13:52,465 --> 00:13:54,433
Just helping Mom and
Dad for the season.

207
00:13:55,635 --> 00:13:58,195
Well, I hope you have another
one of your festivals.

208
00:13:58,271 --> 00:14:01,434
Miriam and I just love listening
to your records out on that lawn.

209
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:04,341
Sure, Max. This year,
I'm going to try to get a live quartet.

210
00:14:04,411 --> 00:14:06,345
Looks like you're gonna have
some competition.

211
00:14:06,413 --> 00:14:09,007
What, there's a recall vote
down at the Chamber of Commerce?

212
00:14:09,716 --> 00:14:10,808
This says here
that Wallkill's

213
00:14:10,884 --> 00:14:12,818
gonna have
a music festival, too.

214
00:14:12,886 --> 00:14:14,444
Some hippie thing
got thrown out of Woodstock

215
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:16,921
so they've set
themselves up in Wallkill.

216
00:14:18,258 --> 00:14:20,453
Wow, Janis Joplin.

217
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:23,325
Guess that beats playing a
bunch of records on a lawn.

218
00:14:23,396 --> 00:14:26,627
Then again, it'll probably turn
into some kind of antiwar riot.

219
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,600
Let Wallkill have them.

220
00:14:29,669 --> 00:14:31,136
Extra bacon.

221
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:33,330
You want your receipt?

222
00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:34,532
Thanks, Dave.

223
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:36,438
See you later.
See you tomorrow, Max.

224
00:14:52,459 --> 00:14:54,051
No, no, no,
that's horrible.

225
00:14:56,162 --> 00:14:57,857
Tonight's dinner
will be roast turkey

226
00:14:57,998 --> 00:14:59,693
and for dessert,
an apple tart.

227
00:15:05,138 --> 00:15:06,662
I killed it!

228
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,571
That clock was
our mother's.

229
00:15:09,743 --> 00:15:11,734
Your mother.
Your mother.

230
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:15,645
Maybe I didn't break it.
Maybe it only looks like I broke it.

231
00:15:15,715 --> 00:15:20,049
Maybe we only think we exist,
when really we don't.

232
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,109
Hi, Elliot.

233
00:15:31,064 --> 00:15:32,156
Thank you, Elliot.

234
00:15:32,232 --> 00:15:33,790
It hasn't been touched
since my glory days

235
00:15:33,867 --> 00:15:35,892
in the Midwood
High School band.

236
00:15:37,537 --> 00:15:40,904
How's the show shaping up?
We're really getting into it.

237
00:15:40,974 --> 00:15:43,670
Great. Hope you guys
are prepared.

238
00:15:44,577 --> 00:15:46,943
You're probably gonna
outnumber the audience.

239
00:15:47,013 --> 00:15:49,777
Only takes one extra soul
to make it theater, man.

240
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:52,312
And theater
is transformation.

241
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:56,422
But it's hard,
concentrating.

242
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:59,117
Concentrating on?

243
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:03,086
We're just,
I don't know, hungry.

244
00:16:03,163 --> 00:16:04,926
Hungry? As in...

245
00:16:04,998 --> 00:16:09,025
Yeah,
as in hungry, you know.

246
00:16:09,102 --> 00:16:11,969
For, like, foodstuffs.

247
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:18,276
You don't have any potatoes or
sunflower seeds or anything?

248
00:16:19,846 --> 00:16:23,338
I can barter some very special grass.
No.

249
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:25,577
Me and grass,
you don't want to know.

250
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:29,115
But let me see what l
can steal from my mom

251
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:31,453
and you guys can pay us
after the first show.

252
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:34,219
Or not, I guess.

253
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:38,286
Front row seats, man.
On the house, for you.

254
00:16:39,032 --> 00:16:41,466
I'm bored!
I'm bored! I'm bored!

255
00:16:42,635 --> 00:16:44,364
That house was ours,
not his.

256
00:16:44,771 --> 00:16:45,829
But he took out
that mortgage,

257
00:16:45,905 --> 00:16:47,770
and now his wife
has all the money.

258
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:50,469
I can't take it any longer!
I can't! I can't!

259
00:16:50,944 --> 00:16:54,971
Please throw me out,
just throw me out! I can't take it!

260
00:17:12,565 --> 00:17:15,898
Hello?
- Hey, Elliot.

261
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:21,030
Steven, hi. What are you
doing calling long distance?

262
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:23,401
I just made bail.

263
00:17:23,476 --> 00:17:26,502
The pigs raided the bar again.
Can you believe it?

264
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:31,510
But you should come back. I think
we're going to have another riot.

265
00:17:31,584 --> 00:17:34,712
Come up here.
You can start a riot here in White Lake.

266
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:36,911
It would be wild.

267
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:40,056
I was just calling,
you know.

268
00:17:40,193 --> 00:17:42,593
New York hasn't been
as much fun without you.

269
00:17:42,662 --> 00:17:45,631
I mean, it hasn't been as depressing,
but, you know, in a fun way.

270
00:17:45,698 --> 00:17:48,633
So, me and Marcus, we're hitching
a ride with the art dealer.

271
00:17:48,701 --> 00:17:49,929
Do you remember him?

272
00:17:50,003 --> 00:17:52,972
The one with the doll collection?
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

273
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:56,372
We're moving to San Francisco, man.
You wanna join?

274
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:01,804
Elliot? You there?

275
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:05,475
Yeah, I'm still here.

276
00:18:07,187 --> 00:18:11,214
Hey, thanks for the call.
It's good to hear your voice.

277
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:16,058
And drop me a line
when you get there, okay?

278
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:18,019
Okay.

279
00:18:39,252 --> 00:18:42,949
Elli. There's something
moving in the bushes!

280
00:18:59,939 --> 00:19:02,601
Take cover, man.
Billy.

281
00:19:02,675 --> 00:19:05,109
What is it?
We're surrounded, man.

282
00:19:06,012 --> 00:19:07,946
Can't you feel it?

283
00:19:08,014 --> 00:19:10,107
It's like, when
the radio was busted,

284
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,343
and we fragged
that fucking sergeant,

285
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,645
so then they just
leave us out here.

286
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:18,552
But someone's gotta go back
and call in air support,

287
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:19,785
'cause I gotta
stay with O'Connor.

288
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:22,123
He doesn't have
any feet, man.

289
00:19:23,563 --> 00:19:25,087
It's okay, Billy.

290
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:27,697
The radio's working
in the office.

291
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:31,066
I can call from there.
And you can cover me, right?

292
00:19:32,605 --> 00:19:35,438
And I'll do some
recon with the squad,

293
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:39,171
they can send up
some reinforcements,

294
00:19:39,245 --> 00:19:41,805
and the VC
will never see me.

295
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:43,812
And I can call in
the coordinates.

296
00:19:43,883 --> 00:19:46,249
What the fuck you
talking about, Elliot?

297
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:48,386
I don't know.

298
00:19:50,423 --> 00:19:53,256
I thought maybe I could be in
your flashback or something.

299
00:19:54,227 --> 00:19:56,320
If it made you
feel any better.

300
00:19:57,664 --> 00:19:59,154
That's cool.

301
00:20:04,237 --> 00:20:05,761
You all right?

302
00:20:19,686 --> 00:20:21,779
Man, I am fucked up.

303
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:28,658
You think I should take those
pills they gave me at the VA?

304
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:31,460
I should probably just
take those fucking pills,

305
00:20:31,531 --> 00:20:34,295
but then I just
sleep all the time,

306
00:20:34,367 --> 00:20:38,133
and then there's the
fucking nightmares. Fuck.

307
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:48,276
Never thought l'd end up back here.
Me neither.

308
00:20:53,086 --> 00:20:56,214
I'm thinking,
maybe I should do another tour.

309
00:20:56,289 --> 00:20:58,519
That doesn't sound
like such a good idea.

310
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:05,054
Over in 'Nam, I'm fucking normal.
Do you know what I'm saying?

311
00:21:09,302 --> 00:21:10,792
Hey, you should join up.

312
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:12,167
Me?
Yeah.

313
00:21:12,238 --> 00:21:14,866
No. They wouldn't
take me even if I wanted.

314
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:16,738
Yeah?
Flat feet.

315
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:22,381
Right. Feet.

316
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:24,811
Fuck.

317
00:21:25,318 --> 00:21:28,378
Yeah, you're not fucking
normal, Elliot. No.

318
00:21:29,122 --> 00:21:30,714
I guess not.

319
00:21:35,495 --> 00:21:38,487
All I know is we're
fucking surrounded here.

320
00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:57,707
Eat.

321
00:22:25,011 --> 00:22:27,002
Thank you, Elliot.

322
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:30,879
For the backdrops you painted for all
of us. Everybody loves the colors.

323
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:34,044
It's like a mandala.
Actually, it's not like a mandala.

324
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:37,886
Well, the colors,
it's more like M&M'S.

325
00:22:38,591 --> 00:22:39,888
You're welcome, Dev.

326
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:43,221
Hey, you guys
want some? Cholent?

327
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:45,856
Uh...

328
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,362
Maybe next time.

329
00:22:51,304 --> 00:22:52,794
No, I'm cool.

330
00:22:55,074 --> 00:22:56,939
Hey, man,
what's up with this?

331
00:22:57,009 --> 00:22:58,943
The festival.
The locals killed it.

332
00:22:59,011 --> 00:23:00,239
They pulled the permit.

333
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:01,641
In Wallkill?

334
00:23:02,348 --> 00:23:05,715
- The Wallkillians killed it.
- Bummer, man.

335
00:23:06,552 --> 00:23:10,283
We were all hoping to score
some tickets and go over for it.

336
00:23:11,224 --> 00:23:15,991
Could have been beautiful.
Joan Baez, Grateful Dead, The Who.

337
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:18,826
Maybe even Dylan.
- Yeah, Dylan.

338
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:20,120
Dylan.

339
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:24,600
Can I get that
paper for a sec?

340
00:23:27,807 --> 00:23:29,934
Is everything
all right, Elliot?

341
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:36,171
Operator.

342
00:23:36,249 --> 00:23:38,376
Hi, Alice.
Can you connect me with something called

343
00:23:38,451 --> 00:23:41,716
the Woodstock Ventures
in New York City,

344
00:23:41,854 --> 00:23:44,880
a gentleman by
the name of Michael Lang.

345
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:49,390
Elli! What is this
with the sheets?

346
00:23:49,462 --> 00:23:52,124
What does it look like?
I'm making a big cross on the lawn!

347
00:23:52,198 --> 00:23:56,567
With the clean sheets?
Jake, our boy's gone crazy!

348
00:23:56,636 --> 00:23:59,571
Making a Ku Klux Klan
rally on our property!

349
00:23:59,639 --> 00:24:02,130
No, it's so they can find us.
Who?

350
00:25:08,874 --> 00:25:12,469
Hey, man.
Good to see you. Hi.

351
00:25:14,447 --> 00:25:16,642
You don't remember
me, Elli?

352
00:25:16,716 --> 00:25:19,685
Do we know each other?
Bensonhurst, 73rd Street.

353
00:25:19,752 --> 00:25:22,653
I lived down the street from you, man.
We played stickball.

354
00:25:22,722 --> 00:25:25,657
I'm Michael Lang,
you're Elli Teichberg.

355
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:29,521
Yeah, yeah, I kind of remember, yeah.
Mrs. Teichberg.

356
00:25:29,595 --> 00:25:33,998
Hey, it's Michael,
from the neighborhood. Excuse me.

357
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,692
You! Cover your parts!
We have company!

358
00:25:38,337 --> 00:25:43,331
In the barn. Get in the barn!
All of you! In!

359
00:25:44,143 --> 00:25:45,872
Get inside!
Far out.

360
00:25:47,647 --> 00:25:50,411
So, here we are.
Right.

361
00:25:50,483 --> 00:25:52,178
Yes, as I mentioned
on the phone...

362
00:25:52,251 --> 00:25:54,651
You have a permit.
That's very cool, Elli.

363
00:25:59,091 --> 00:26:00,558
It's a start.

364
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:03,058
Very cool.

365
00:26:04,163 --> 00:26:05,152
Please.

366
00:26:06,432 --> 00:26:07,421
Mr. Teichberg.

367
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:36,053
Hey, people!
Welcome to Elliot's place.

368
00:26:36,996 --> 00:26:38,759
Hey, Elli, can we
take a look around?

369
00:26:38,831 --> 00:26:41,163
Of course, I'll show
you the whole place.

370
00:26:51,577 --> 00:26:53,374
You've got some
open land here, right?

371
00:26:53,446 --> 00:26:55,937
Absolutely,
just up here and down.

372
00:27:05,925 --> 00:27:06,914
So...

373
00:27:24,744 --> 00:27:25,733
Shit!

374
00:27:29,582 --> 00:27:32,244
Michael, for Christ's sake,
it's a swamp.

375
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:36,485
Maybe we could get some bulldozers
in here and level it, right?

376
00:27:36,555 --> 00:27:38,523
You're kidding me.
He owns it.

377
00:27:39,125 --> 00:27:42,185
He's got a permit. He's the
President of the Chamber of Commerce.

378
00:27:42,261 --> 00:27:45,492
And because of that you wanna
drown thousands of kids in a swamp?

379
00:27:45,564 --> 00:27:47,964
Look, honestly, you guys can
do whatever you want to here.

380
00:27:48,033 --> 00:27:49,864
That's fine
with us, really.

381
00:27:49,935 --> 00:27:51,459
You could... For example,
you could detonate

382
00:27:51,537 --> 00:27:53,027
an incredible amount
of explosives

383
00:27:53,105 --> 00:27:55,369
and it would dry
everything out immediately.

384
00:27:55,441 --> 00:27:57,875
And then you could just compact
the ashes down, you know,

385
00:27:57,943 --> 00:28:00,207
and people could
sit on that.

386
00:28:02,581 --> 00:28:06,745
Radical thinking, Elliot.
I assume you got a permit for that, too?

387
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:11,679
Or... Okay,
we get some big cranes

388
00:28:11,791 --> 00:28:15,625
and hang, like, a parachute over the
field, and everyone could sit on it.

389
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:16,683
No?

390
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:19,664
How about you just
nuke the whole place?

391
00:28:19,732 --> 00:28:22,599
Hey, don't lose
that creativity, man.

392
00:28:26,605 --> 00:28:28,630
Jake, they are leaving!

393
00:28:30,776 --> 00:28:34,075
Elli, have you offered
accommodation to everyone?

394
00:28:34,146 --> 00:28:36,910
We may not have vacancy for everyone,
as the season is...

395
00:28:36,982 --> 00:28:41,009
Ma, they're not staying.
Stay! Stay! Look.

396
00:28:41,987 --> 00:28:44,785
My husband is
bringing refreshments.

397
00:28:44,857 --> 00:28:47,382
Here.
Thank you, Mrs. Teichberg.

398
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:52,163
Here. Try some of this.

399
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:56,827
It is the best chocolate milk in
New York. Made just down the road.

400
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,570
Have some water.
Or some chocolate milk.

401
00:29:06,178 --> 00:29:08,772
What's his name?
Or her. Lou.

402
00:29:09,782 --> 00:29:13,411
Wow. That is excellent
chocolate milk.

403
00:29:13,485 --> 00:29:16,181
Yeah, it comes from the local cows.
Far out.

404
00:29:17,156 --> 00:29:20,489
They eat local grass.
That must be some healthy grass.

405
00:29:21,427 --> 00:29:24,191
And there's a lot of it,
in big fields,

406
00:29:24,263 --> 00:29:26,254
just a couple of miles
down the road from us.

407
00:29:34,707 --> 00:29:37,733
I've always been a big supporter
of Elliot, here in Bethel,

408
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:40,574
and I always enjoy his
music festival every summer.

409
00:29:40,646 --> 00:29:45,276
That's why we're here. Miriam and
I donate the yogurt and the milk.

410
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:48,747
It's fate.

411
00:29:50,055 --> 00:29:51,181
It's beautiful.

412
00:29:52,024 --> 00:29:56,051
Although some of the local young people,
the music they play

413
00:29:56,128 --> 00:30:00,030
can be a little trying,
if you know what I mean, honestly.

414
00:30:00,099 --> 00:30:02,727
Yeah, but it's the effort that counts,
isn't it, Miriam?

415
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:04,701
And they do
enjoy themselves.

416
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:07,068
There's a lot of joy
in music, Mr. Yasgur.

417
00:30:07,873 --> 00:30:12,003
And we'd love to bring that joy to
your beautiful farm, wouldn't we?

418
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:19,916
Now, I know it's going to be
something of an imposition,

419
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:21,145
but we're more than
willing to do anything...

420
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:24,246
You say you want to
use these fields here?

421
00:30:24,323 --> 00:30:26,587
Then you'll be needing the
land beside the barns as well,

422
00:30:26,692 --> 00:30:29,217
I'm guessing,
for access to the roads.

423
00:30:29,295 --> 00:30:30,887
And parking.

424
00:30:30,963 --> 00:30:34,023
Probably best
across 17B.

425
00:30:34,099 --> 00:30:37,967
I own the piece down the road,
but there are a couple of lots.

426
00:30:38,938 --> 00:30:42,430
You'll probably want to avoid
dealing with the Browns.

427
00:30:42,574 --> 00:30:46,066
And you'll clean up after yourselves,
I'm hoping.

428
00:30:46,145 --> 00:30:47,476
Of course.

429
00:30:49,548 --> 00:30:50,674
Well,

430
00:30:53,319 --> 00:30:55,446
would $5,000
do it for you?

431
00:30:58,824 --> 00:31:00,052
Five?

432
00:31:00,125 --> 00:31:02,025
But you'll have to tidy up,
and you'll have to pay

433
00:31:02,094 --> 00:31:04,494
for any damaged crops,
of course.

434
00:31:11,337 --> 00:31:14,101
Sure, Max.
That sounds fine.

435
00:31:16,075 --> 00:31:18,270
Good. Wonderful.

436
00:31:19,411 --> 00:31:22,778
Well, why don't you all come into
the house for some chocolate milk?

437
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:25,574
Far out.

438
00:32:00,886 --> 00:32:02,547
You know, we're gonna need
a place for people to crash

439
00:32:02,621 --> 00:32:04,145
while we prepare
the festival.

440
00:32:04,223 --> 00:32:05,713
Your place looks
pretty cool.

441
00:32:05,791 --> 00:32:08,817
How many vacant rooms do you have
for the next couple of weeks?

442
00:32:10,195 --> 00:32:12,356
Well, it depends on
how you define room.

443
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:14,126
You know,
how many people can crash with you.

444
00:32:14,199 --> 00:32:15,598
What do you guys charge?

445
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:19,603
Let's see. It's $8 a night,
but that can be for doubles,

446
00:32:19,671 --> 00:32:21,639
and we give a weekly discount,
of course.

447
00:32:21,707 --> 00:32:25,837
Plus the cabins,
you can get cots, so four people,

448
00:32:25,911 --> 00:32:27,401
about 150, I'd say.

449
00:32:27,479 --> 00:32:30,243
You can get about 200 people.
Hey, man, let's make it easy.

450
00:32:30,315 --> 00:32:33,478
Why don't we just buy the El
Monaco out for the season?

451
00:32:33,552 --> 00:32:35,952
Just figure out the costs,
write it down, and we'll take a look.

452
00:32:36,021 --> 00:32:37,113
And if we don't
use all the rooms,

453
00:32:37,189 --> 00:32:38,383
you can rent out
the free ones.

454
00:32:38,457 --> 00:32:40,152
We need to keep some cleanup
crews around afterwards.

455
00:32:40,225 --> 00:32:41,522
And if you've got
some bigger spaces,

456
00:32:41,593 --> 00:32:43,060
for offices,
that kind of thing.

457
00:32:43,128 --> 00:32:45,426
We need to put in some phones and
have some space to park vehicles.

458
00:32:45,497 --> 00:32:47,158
You know where we're going?
Mmm-hmm.

459
00:32:50,602 --> 00:32:52,331
There you go.
That's the...

460
00:32:53,405 --> 00:32:56,465
Looks like we can work
with this, Elli. Cool.

461
00:32:57,109 --> 00:33:01,205
You know, I was thinking, I've got
that theater troupe in the barn.

462
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,941
A theater troupe
in the barn?

463
00:33:03,048 --> 00:33:06,779
Yeah, the Earthlight Players.
It's okay if they stay, right?

464
00:33:08,187 --> 00:33:10,382
Maybe you guys could find some
work for them or something.

465
00:33:10,456 --> 00:33:12,686
They could really
use the pay.

466
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:16,783
They're all hired, man.
Not a problem. Great. Thanks.

467
00:33:18,797 --> 00:33:22,130
And I hope you don't mind,
but we like to pay cash

468
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:26,101
in advance.

469
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:38,043
And not only that, he made me a local
community liaison for the festival,

470
00:33:38,117 --> 00:33:40,711
and we're going to be the
exclusive local ticket agency, too.

471
00:33:40,786 --> 00:33:44,483
They think at least 5,000 people
are gonna buy tickets, or more.

472
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:48,383
Five thousand coming
here to White Lake?

473
00:33:49,628 --> 00:33:51,493
Elli, you're an idiot.

474
00:33:51,563 --> 00:33:53,428
Twenty people, thirty,
okay, for a weekend.

475
00:33:53,499 --> 00:33:55,558
But 1,000, 5,000?
They'll steal everything.

476
00:33:55,634 --> 00:33:57,363
Ma... We'll be sued in
court by the neighbors.

477
00:33:57,436 --> 00:34:01,372
What kind of meshuga, hairy, barefoot
person comes here in a heliocoptic

478
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,874
that we should lay our good white
sheets on the grass and ruin them,

479
00:34:03,942 --> 00:34:06,274
and then plot and revolutionize
to take our hotel.

480
00:34:06,345 --> 00:34:07,710
Ma, he pays cash.

481
00:34:07,779 --> 00:34:09,804
Everyone pays cash here,
you shnook!

482
00:34:09,882 --> 00:34:12,373
No, Ma, really.
Open it.

483
00:34:13,752 --> 00:34:14,980
Open it.

484
00:34:19,124 --> 00:34:22,116
That's $5,000 for the rent, and another
$5,000 for my services as liaison.

485
00:34:22,194 --> 00:34:23,923
Plus, think of the money we're
gonna make off of commissions

486
00:34:23,996 --> 00:34:25,759
from the ticket sales!
And also...

487
00:34:30,669 --> 00:34:33,331
El Monaco lnternational
Casino and Bar Mitzvah Center.

488
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:35,339
Elliot?
Hey, Max.

489
00:34:35,407 --> 00:34:39,173
Hi. Well, the phone hasn't
stopped ringing since you left.

490
00:34:39,244 --> 00:34:40,905
And they're saying...
I know, wow.

491
00:34:40,979 --> 00:34:43,470
...thousands of people might
be coming to this thing. Yeah.

492
00:34:43,549 --> 00:34:45,380
Well, you know,
that's gonna cost

493
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:47,247
quite a bit to put
things back in order,

494
00:34:47,319 --> 00:34:51,016
and to get the cows situated and
so forth. I can understand, sure.

495
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:52,989
Now, Elliot,
you know I don't wish

496
00:34:53,058 --> 00:34:54,889
to mess up your festival.
You know that.

497
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,361
'Cause I think what was done to
those young people in Wallkill

498
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:02,093
was just plain wrong.
But I've been talking with Miriam,

499
00:35:02,167 --> 00:35:05,193
and we think if you could just
go back and tell those people...

500
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:08,569
How much? Seventy-five thousand.
Not a penny less.

501
00:35:10,576 --> 00:35:12,567
Okay, I'll let them know.

502
00:35:13,979 --> 00:35:16,470
Okay, good. Bye-bye.

503
00:35:20,052 --> 00:35:21,144
What?

504
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:25,020
Don't spend any of that money.
That was Max. The deal's off.

505
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:27,752
What? Impossible!

506
00:35:27,893 --> 00:35:30,555
Ma. Ma. Ma.

507
00:35:30,662 --> 00:35:33,825
Elli, don't try to stop her.
She can't get far.

508
00:35:35,534 --> 00:35:37,502
And I read in the papers,
you've already sold

509
00:35:37,569 --> 00:35:40,538
thousands of tickets,
and that's a lot.

510
00:35:40,606 --> 00:35:41,971
And so you'll be
needing to use,

511
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:45,066
practically, my whole place here,
not just the alfalfa fields.

512
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:47,873
Now, wait a second.
I mean, I could...

513
00:35:48,981 --> 00:35:52,815
I mean, I could buy a farm for the
kind of money you're asking for.

514
00:35:52,884 --> 00:35:54,442
I could buy five farms.

515
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:56,419
From what I read in
the papers, Mr. Roberts,

516
00:35:56,488 --> 00:35:58,786
you've already spent a
million dollars in Wallkill,

517
00:35:58,857 --> 00:36:01,951
and you've only got until
the 15th until your festival.

518
00:36:02,027 --> 00:36:04,427
Now, I'm sure a wealthy
young man such as yourself

519
00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:06,862
could, indeed,
buy a lot of farms.

520
00:36:06,932 --> 00:36:09,196
But that's neither here nor there.
All I'm saying is...

521
00:36:09,268 --> 00:36:13,034
Yeah, all you're saying is that
you've got us over a barrel.

522
00:36:14,273 --> 00:36:16,002
Well, if I didn't,
you wouldn't be on your second carton

523
00:36:16,074 --> 00:36:18,542
of chocolate milk
now, would you?

524
00:36:18,977 --> 00:36:22,276
But I tell you this, fellas, when
you make a deal with me, it's a deal.

525
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:24,781
Okay? So long as you promise
to put things back in order,

526
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:26,875
I'll stand by you 100%.

527
00:36:26,952 --> 00:36:28,180
These people
are my neighbors,

528
00:36:28,253 --> 00:36:29,811
and I know how
to deal with them.

529
00:36:29,888 --> 00:36:33,119
I won't let them run you off
like they did in Wallkill,

530
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:36,558
'cause this is my land,
and let's just see them try.

531
00:36:37,462 --> 00:36:41,193
Wow, Max, that is very cool.
And you're right.

532
00:36:41,566 --> 00:36:42,726
We're going to
have a lot of people

533
00:36:42,801 --> 00:36:44,166
come here and
enjoy your place.

534
00:36:44,236 --> 00:36:48,195
Michael, if I may,
I wouldn't describe $75,000 as cool.

535
00:36:48,273 --> 00:36:49,831
$5,000 is cool.

536
00:36:49,908 --> 00:36:52,103
Hey, it's your bread, guys.

537
00:36:52,177 --> 00:36:55,305
I'm just trying to put you
together here with Max's vision.

538
00:36:57,115 --> 00:37:01,643
Right. Look, Max, if we were
willing to consider doing this,

539
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,517
you're really gonna have to
let us make it work.

540
00:37:03,588 --> 00:37:07,547
Mike, listen, really,
if this doesn't shake out with Max...

541
00:37:07,626 --> 00:37:09,526
I'm sure we're
gonna be fine.

542
00:37:09,594 --> 00:37:13,052
John and Joel and Max,
they're all gonna come together.

543
00:37:13,932 --> 00:37:15,092
I can feel it.

544
00:37:17,202 --> 00:37:18,396
Good vibes.

545
00:37:19,638 --> 00:37:21,799
- He won't let them near it.
- Smithson? Who's Smithson?

546
00:37:21,873 --> 00:37:24,398
- I don't own the property down there.
- You don't own the property?

547
00:37:24,476 --> 00:37:26,535
I own this
and I own that,

548
00:37:26,611 --> 00:37:30,172
which reminds me, I'm sure you'll
be willing to put up a bond,

549
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:34,514
just in case there's damage.
I was thinking $75,000.

550
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:36,850
Fuck!
A $75,000 bond, too?

551
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:41,559
Can I ask you a question?
Please.

552
00:37:41,626 --> 00:37:45,687
Is Mike for real?
I mean, he's so relaxed.

553
00:37:46,598 --> 00:37:51,228
Michael, yeah,
he's totally real,

554
00:37:52,971 --> 00:37:55,098
so long as
the cash is real.

555
00:37:55,707 --> 00:37:57,732
And the cash is real so long
as John and Joel are real.

556
00:37:57,809 --> 00:38:01,210
And I guess John and Joel
are gonna stay real because,

557
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:05,511
between us,
they've already sold 100,000 tickets.

558
00:38:07,686 --> 00:38:11,383
And who wants 100,000 freaks
coming after them for refunds?

559
00:38:13,725 --> 00:38:15,420
So Mikey is trying
to sell those six acres.

560
00:38:15,494 --> 00:38:17,394
It's got a lake?
Yeah.

561
00:38:33,278 --> 00:38:36,042
Hey, Dave.
I'll have the usual.

562
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:40,148
Geez, sorry, Elliot.
I think we're out of the usual.

563
00:38:42,421 --> 00:38:47,518
Out of the usual?
Wow, that's unusual.

564
00:38:47,592 --> 00:38:50,527
For crying out loud, Elliot.
How could you?

565
00:38:53,865 --> 00:38:56,197
Okay, then I'll try
the waffles.

566
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:11,640
"To ensure three days of peace
and music, we've left Wallkill

567
00:39:11,716 --> 00:39:13,877
"and are now in
White Lake, New York.

568
00:39:13,952 --> 00:39:17,888
"Certain people of Wallkill decided
to try to run us out of town.

569
00:39:17,956 --> 00:39:23,553
"Our new site, it's twice the
size of our original site."

570
00:39:23,628 --> 00:39:25,391
You did this, Teichberg.

571
00:39:25,464 --> 00:39:27,398
You know what those hippies
are gonna do to our town?

572
00:39:27,466 --> 00:39:28,933
They'll be high on drugs.

573
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,730
Robbing us by day and
raping the cattle at night.

574
00:39:31,803 --> 00:39:35,432
- We ought to run you Jews out of town.
- You and Yasgur.

575
00:39:35,507 --> 00:39:38,533
- We're gonna boycott Yasgur's milk.
- Shut the hotel down, too.

576
00:39:40,679 --> 00:39:43,113
- Get out of here, you hippie.
- You're disgusting, Elliot.

577
00:39:47,285 --> 00:39:48,946
You know what, Elliot?
You're not the only...

578
00:39:50,489 --> 00:39:53,014
Elliot! God bless you.
Hi, Annie.

579
00:39:53,091 --> 00:39:54,922
You can't imagine
what happened this morning.

580
00:39:54,993 --> 00:39:57,826
What? I'm fully booked!
Every room!

581
00:39:57,896 --> 00:39:59,523
Yeah, me, too.
For the first time

582
00:39:59,598 --> 00:40:01,463
since Herb died.
Thank you, Elliot.

583
00:40:01,533 --> 00:40:03,194
You're welcome.
Thank you, Elliot.

584
00:40:09,174 --> 00:40:10,163
Hi.

585
00:40:15,447 --> 00:40:18,507
Those motherfuckers in there
wanna fuck you up, huh?

586
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:20,915
That seems to be
the sense I'm getting.

587
00:40:20,986 --> 00:40:26,322
Well, you're gonna have to carve
some fucking hearts out, man.

588
00:40:27,592 --> 00:40:30,026
Fry them on a stick
over a fire pit

589
00:40:30,095 --> 00:40:33,496
and then sit down and eat them,
before those motherfuckers

590
00:40:33,565 --> 00:40:35,692
do the aforesaid
fucking to you, man!

591
00:40:35,767 --> 00:40:37,200
Billy, can you just stop
with the motherfucking this

592
00:40:37,269 --> 00:40:39,294
and motherfucking that.
Please?

593
00:40:42,774 --> 00:40:44,901
Fuck.
Yeah. Fuck.

594
00:40:52,484 --> 00:40:54,975
This could really
be a down trip.

595
00:40:55,053 --> 00:40:58,045
My brother and his wife,
they're getting fucking organized.

596
00:40:58,123 --> 00:40:59,249
Then what should I do?

597
00:40:59,324 --> 00:41:02,851
Get fucking organized yourself.
Rally your troops.

598
00:41:03,929 --> 00:41:06,193
Do I have troops?
Fuck, yeah.

599
00:41:07,299 --> 00:41:10,791
You got your mom, don't you?
She's a fucking battalion.

600
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:15,531
And the Chamber of Commerce. This
whole thing is about commerce, right?

601
00:41:15,607 --> 00:41:18,007
Right on!
Right on.

602
00:41:20,545 --> 00:41:26,643
I'm off to HQ.
At ease, men... Man.

603
00:41:34,192 --> 00:41:37,719
Go fry those fuckers.
Elliot!

604
00:42:04,956 --> 00:42:06,617
We were in Wallkill.

605
00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:09,216
Hanging with some friends,
making the scene.

606
00:42:09,294 --> 00:42:12,923
Rapping on each other.
And they said this is where it's at.

607
00:42:12,998 --> 00:42:16,092
So we rode our thumbs up here.
Can you dig it?

608
00:42:17,736 --> 00:42:19,795
Elli, help.

609
00:42:20,372 --> 00:42:23,432
It's these two.
They want a hole.

610
00:42:23,508 --> 00:42:24,975
To dig their thumbs.

611
00:42:25,043 --> 00:42:28,604
After they hit each other,
they made a scene in Wallkill!

612
00:42:29,714 --> 00:42:31,079
What are they
talking about?

613
00:42:31,149 --> 00:42:34,585
Just looking to score,
you know, the magic tickets.

614
00:42:35,286 --> 00:42:38,312
Dad, get the tickets.
To the festival.

615
00:42:55,874 --> 00:42:58,900
Okay, Neil, we can see you coming
down the ladder now.

616
00:43:00,679 --> 00:43:02,704
Heading back up
to that first step.

617
00:43:02,781 --> 00:43:06,182
But it's adequate
to get back up.

618
00:43:06,885 --> 00:43:10,013
Roger. We copy.
Takes a pretty good little jump.

619
00:43:20,131 --> 00:43:22,691
Hey. Hi, Tisha.
What is it?

620
00:43:23,201 --> 00:43:25,533
You've got
a couple of visitors.

621
00:43:39,284 --> 00:43:41,343
Hello? What can
I do for you?

622
00:43:41,419 --> 00:43:42,647
Mr. Teichberg?
Yes.

623
00:43:42,721 --> 00:43:47,055
Here. That's 47 citations. Wiring,
plumbing, health code violations.

624
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:48,990
Quite a place
you've got here.

625
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:52,962
It's humble, but it's home.
Away from home, I mean.

626
00:43:53,031 --> 00:43:56,660
And here's 14 more fire code.
You're way over the occupancy limits.

627
00:43:56,735 --> 00:43:58,464
You've got five days
to pay up and repair

628
00:43:58,536 --> 00:44:00,629
or else we're shutting
you down for good.

629
00:44:00,705 --> 00:44:02,366
Have a nice day.

630
00:44:22,927 --> 00:44:24,155
What's going on?

631
00:44:24,229 --> 00:44:26,322
Your mother says we
can triple our money.

632
00:44:26,397 --> 00:44:28,092
Three times the rooms.

633
00:44:28,166 --> 00:44:29,633
You're kidding me.

634
00:44:29,701 --> 00:44:35,264
They don't seem to mind. Honest.
These people, they like it.

635
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:37,672
I'm finished here,
you start on the bunking.

636
00:44:37,909 --> 00:44:40,605
I don't know.
White Lake sounds better than Wallkill.

637
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:42,509
Don't ask me why
they call it Woodstock.

638
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:44,548
Everyone's gonna drive
to the fucking real Woodstock

639
00:44:44,616 --> 00:44:46,345
and be really bummed
when they get there.

640
00:44:46,417 --> 00:44:49,784
DOT's letting us put signage up.
Just not on the Thruway yet.

641
00:44:49,854 --> 00:44:51,378
But we're working on it.
We're gonna want to run lines

642
00:44:51,456 --> 00:44:52,480
all the way
back to the fence.

643
00:44:52,557 --> 00:44:53,854
Can you trench here?

644
00:44:53,925 --> 00:44:56,587
No, man. Everything,
water pipes, juice,

645
00:44:56,661 --> 00:44:58,219
all the cables
gotta run aboveground.

646
00:44:58,296 --> 00:45:00,423
I got the specs from Hanley,
for the speakers.

647
00:45:00,498 --> 00:45:01,692
That's a lot of juice.

648
00:45:01,766 --> 00:45:04,200
When Hendrix lights up, there won't
be a bird left in Sullivan County.

649
00:45:04,269 --> 00:45:06,601
Hey, I spoke to Wavy Gravy
and the Hog Farmers.

650
00:45:06,671 --> 00:45:07,695
Wavy?
Yeah.

651
00:45:07,772 --> 00:45:11,435
His real name's Hugh.
He's got 80 freaks, the Hog Farmers.

652
00:45:11,509 --> 00:45:13,773
They've got a commune
in the desert.

653
00:45:13,912 --> 00:45:16,176
They drop more acid
than Timothy Leary.

654
00:45:16,247 --> 00:45:18,579
There's 80 of them coming
in on a jumbo jet next week.

655
00:45:18,650 --> 00:45:21,881
Hey, man,
I can't find the keys to my room.

656
00:45:21,953 --> 00:45:23,352
Ask my mom.

657
00:45:23,922 --> 00:45:26,186
Hey, how's your room?
Fine, man.

658
00:45:26,257 --> 00:45:28,725
Trip tents?
Yeah, where the kids can come down...

659
00:45:28,793 --> 00:45:31,353
- From the trip.
- Wait, wait. What have you got here?

660
00:45:31,963 --> 00:45:32,952
No, no.
Don't put it down there.

661
00:45:33,031 --> 00:45:35,226
He and his people are willing
to work with you on security.

662
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:38,326
You know, they really like your
non-confrontational approach.

663
00:45:38,403 --> 00:45:41,429
You know,
they wanna call it a "Please Force."

664
00:45:41,873 --> 00:45:44,171
Not sure how Fabbri's
going to like that moniker.

665
00:45:44,242 --> 00:45:45,937
We're still going
to need real police.

666
00:45:48,379 --> 00:45:50,108
Hey, Mike,
do you have a second?

667
00:45:50,248 --> 00:45:51,977
I'm just feeling
a little anxious.

668
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:53,517
Did Tisha tell you about
these code violations?

669
00:45:53,585 --> 00:45:54,950
Hey, Elliot.
Just the man I wanted to see.

670
00:45:55,019 --> 00:45:56,350
You know,
I'm getting the feeling

671
00:45:56,421 --> 00:45:57,718
that we're really
going to be able to use

672
00:45:57,789 --> 00:45:59,017
your community
relations skills.

673
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:00,079
My what skills?

674
00:46:00,158 --> 00:46:01,625
Because, Elli,
the rumors are already swirling,

675
00:46:01,693 --> 00:46:04,127
and we need to put a local
face on the reality here.

676
00:46:04,195 --> 00:46:06,561
And you, Elli,
are a local face.

677
00:46:06,631 --> 00:46:08,929
I'm a local face, yes,
but about these violations.

678
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,991
There's not a hotel around for
miles that could pass inspection.

679
00:46:11,069 --> 00:46:13,833
Those inspector dudes?
Don't worry about that, Elli.

680
00:46:13,938 --> 00:46:17,237
Tisha told me all about those guys.
Just give us the papers.

681
00:46:17,308 --> 00:46:19,833
We've got some
heavy lawyers. Right?

682
00:46:22,013 --> 00:46:23,310
Heavy lawyers. Right.

683
00:46:23,381 --> 00:46:25,008
Because right now, Elli,
I need you to focus

684
00:46:25,083 --> 00:46:26,675
on the positive message
that we're sending.

685
00:46:26,751 --> 00:46:29,117
You know,
rapping with the local townspeople,

686
00:46:29,187 --> 00:46:31,587
finding some time
with some of the papers here.

687
00:46:31,656 --> 00:46:34,147
Wait, you mean like
a press conference?

688
00:46:34,225 --> 00:46:39,322
A press conference. Yeah.
Radical idea, Elli. I love it.

689
00:46:39,397 --> 00:46:41,922
No, actually, you don't.
Me and public speaking,

690
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,195
I can guarantee you,
not one of my strong suits.

691
00:46:44,269 --> 00:46:45,395
I'm speaking from
experience here.

692
00:46:45,470 --> 00:46:48,132
Hey, Michael. Hey.
I want you to meet somebody.

693
00:46:48,206 --> 00:46:49,605
Let me introduce
you to Reverend Don.

694
00:46:49,674 --> 00:46:51,301
He's helping with
our community outreach

695
00:46:51,376 --> 00:46:52,434
and he'd love it if
you could help him

696
00:46:52,510 --> 00:46:55,138
get to know the locals. Hi.
It's really great to meet you.

697
00:46:55,213 --> 00:46:56,373
I don't know how
much Michael's told you,

698
00:46:56,514 --> 00:46:57,708
but we're thinking
of putting on

699
00:46:57,782 --> 00:46:59,613
a little free concert
for the local people here,

700
00:46:59,684 --> 00:47:01,413
and we thought it
would be a great idea to

701
00:47:01,486 --> 00:47:03,010
include a scene from
your theater company.

702
00:47:03,087 --> 00:47:05,021
Do you think
they'd be open to it?

703
00:47:05,089 --> 00:47:09,116
Yeah, they'd love that.
But you said it's for the locals?

704
00:47:09,727 --> 00:47:12,218
Because the play's very contemporary.
Cool.

705
00:47:12,297 --> 00:47:15,061
Hey, hey, you guys,
the phones are alive.

706
00:47:18,236 --> 00:47:19,362
Mike.

707
00:47:22,507 --> 00:47:24,498
Hey, your dad wants you.

708
00:47:45,063 --> 00:47:47,759
I'll get some paint,
but they're just going to do it again.

709
00:47:47,832 --> 00:47:50,960
They set foot here again,
I break their heads.

710
00:47:51,135 --> 00:47:52,898
Dad, let me call...

711
00:47:52,971 --> 00:47:56,907
Call who? That little
putz in the green shirt,

712
00:47:57,008 --> 00:47:58,737
he's the son of
that state trooper.

713
00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:02,443
I could boil him and his
putz of a father in tar.

714
00:48:02,513 --> 00:48:06,210
Just, Dad, let's just get this
painted before Mom sees it.

715
00:48:06,284 --> 00:48:08,912
Then you can start
warming up the tar.

716
00:48:26,838 --> 00:48:27,998
Thanks.

717
00:48:28,106 --> 00:48:30,165
Put some more of
those in the cooler.

718
00:48:30,241 --> 00:48:32,300
Dad, this is all we got.

719
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:33,570
You didn't order more?

720
00:48:33,644 --> 00:48:35,976
I did. And I called Karpen's, too,
for the kitchen.

721
00:48:36,047 --> 00:48:37,674
I asked them all to
bring 10 times our usual.

722
00:48:37,749 --> 00:48:38,841
Well, when they
come tomorrow,

723
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:40,975
you tell them to
bring 20 times more.

724
00:48:41,052 --> 00:48:42,952
No, 30 times.

725
00:48:43,021 --> 00:48:45,421
Where are we
going to put it all?

726
00:48:45,990 --> 00:48:49,187
These people,
they eat and drink like animals,

727
00:48:50,361 --> 00:48:53,023
and there's more of
them every minute.

728
00:48:54,966 --> 00:48:58,629
It doesn't matter where we put it.
It'll be gone in a day.

729
00:49:00,338 --> 00:49:02,203
Yes?
- Couple of Buds, please.

730
00:49:02,273 --> 00:49:04,241
$2. Thank you.

731
00:49:08,646 --> 00:49:11,012
You got that thing working?
Yeah.

732
00:49:11,416 --> 00:49:12,940
Don't touch those wires.

733
00:49:13,017 --> 00:49:16,180
Let's see what you got to put on.
Nothing much.

734
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:30,559
Judy Garland live.
Haven't heard this in a long time.

735
00:49:34,472 --> 00:49:36,804
It's hard to
believe she's gone.

736
00:49:38,409 --> 00:49:40,604
Actually, I can believe it.
I met her once.

737
00:49:40,678 --> 00:49:42,703
Wow. Was she fun?

738
00:49:43,581 --> 00:49:45,310
She was brimming over.

739
00:49:47,118 --> 00:49:48,107
I'm Elliot.

740
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:52,985
Hey. Paul. Construction.
You seen the stage we're building?

741
00:49:53,057 --> 00:49:54,649
No.
It's huge.

742
00:49:54,725 --> 00:49:57,193
Wow. Do you want
another beer?

743
00:49:57,261 --> 00:49:59,252
No, thanks.
I've got a thing going

744
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:01,457
with some Lebanese Red
right now.

745
00:50:02,066 --> 00:50:04,728
Your old man doesn't mind
if we light up in here?

746
00:50:04,802 --> 00:50:07,464
He can't smell.
Too much roofing tar.

747
00:50:08,639 --> 00:50:09,731
Cool.

748
00:50:14,479 --> 00:50:15,605
Cool.

749
00:50:17,081 --> 00:50:19,413
More. More, come on.

750
00:50:20,718 --> 00:50:23,585
Okay, okay.
Good. Good, good, good.

751
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:30,550
- $40.
- Ma.

752
00:50:31,129 --> 00:50:35,589
Ma. Tisha says you're trying to charge
extra for pillows and soap again.

753
00:50:36,534 --> 00:50:38,399
We talked about this.

754
00:50:38,469 --> 00:50:40,061
Don't accuse me!

755
00:50:40,238 --> 00:50:43,071
I got nothing to sell anyway,
not even toilet paper!

756
00:50:43,141 --> 00:50:44,768
Which leads me to ask,
where do you think all these people

757
00:50:44,842 --> 00:50:46,776
you're renting space to are
going to do their business?

758
00:50:46,844 --> 00:50:49,074
You've got to stop, Ma.
Enough with the money.

759
00:50:49,147 --> 00:50:51,206
We just paid
off the mortgage.

760
00:50:51,282 --> 00:50:53,512
Think about it!
Can't you just be happy?

761
00:50:53,784 --> 00:50:55,911
What're you doing?
What're you doing?

762
00:50:55,987 --> 00:50:57,978
Hey!
No! No!

763
00:50:58,089 --> 00:51:00,922
No shtupping in the bushes!
Ma, come on.

764
00:51:01,926 --> 00:51:03,188
Come on.

765
00:51:03,961 --> 00:51:05,690
Excuse me, when does
the ticket office open?

766
00:51:05,763 --> 00:51:07,390
Not yet! Soon!

767
00:51:12,270 --> 00:51:15,603
Good morning.
You must be the lovely wife and child.

768
00:51:17,441 --> 00:51:18,465
What's up, Dad?

769
00:51:18,543 --> 00:51:20,238
We were just
telling your pops here

770
00:51:20,311 --> 00:51:23,712
it looks like you guys are
getting some nice business.

771
00:51:23,781 --> 00:51:24,873
Yeah?

772
00:51:24,949 --> 00:51:27,645
So, it looks like
you can use some help.

773
00:51:27,718 --> 00:51:29,845
He's talking
nonsense, Elli.

774
00:51:30,354 --> 00:51:35,382
Something about exclusive
transportation and security for $10,000.

775
00:51:39,063 --> 00:51:42,032
I get it. No, you don't get it.
We get it.

776
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:46,099
You got live entertainment
happening here, beverages, etcetera.

777
00:51:46,170 --> 00:51:51,506
Yeah. We cover the hotels around the
racetrack in Monticello. We cover you.

778
00:51:52,009 --> 00:51:54,136
And what if I say
you don't?

779
00:51:54,478 --> 00:51:57,413
Charlie, what do we
do if he says we don't?

780
00:51:57,481 --> 00:52:01,281
You're trespassers. Get out,
or I make you get out.

781
00:52:01,652 --> 00:52:03,017
Is that so?

782
00:52:03,688 --> 00:52:05,178
You hear this?

783
00:52:05,957 --> 00:52:07,891
Enough with these bums!

784
00:52:09,527 --> 00:52:11,290
Dad, what're you doing? Stop.

785
00:52:11,362 --> 00:52:13,956
- Hey, come on. Hey!
- No, stop!

786
00:52:16,968 --> 00:52:18,833
Come on, get...
Christ almighty!

787
00:52:28,579 --> 00:52:30,570
Go on.
Get out of here!

788
00:52:30,648 --> 00:52:33,173
Jesus! You people
are like animals.

789
00:52:34,585 --> 00:52:37,884
Get out!
Get out of my property!

790
00:52:39,056 --> 00:52:40,546
I'll show you!

791
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:43,956
Get off my property!

792
00:52:45,429 --> 00:52:48,421
Get out! Don't try
to come back here!

793
00:52:48,499 --> 00:52:50,763
Next time we
won't be so nice!

794
00:52:54,205 --> 00:52:57,902
My arthritis is killing me. I told
you not to stand at the bar all night.

795
00:52:57,975 --> 00:52:59,875
Dad, Ma,
you're superheroes.

796
00:53:01,045 --> 00:53:02,273
Far out.

797
00:53:02,346 --> 00:53:03,643
You didn't
tell me anything.

798
00:53:03,714 --> 00:53:06,012
How would you know what I tell you?
You're deaf.

799
00:53:37,615 --> 00:53:39,310
Hey, Elliot.
Hey.

800
00:53:39,517 --> 00:53:41,678
What do you think
of the mess we're making?

801
00:53:42,253 --> 00:53:44,847
It's...
Wonderful, isn't it?

802
00:53:44,922 --> 00:53:46,890
It is. Yeah, Max.

803
00:53:47,491 --> 00:53:49,925
I'm just sorry everyone in
town hates our guts now.

804
00:53:49,994 --> 00:53:52,053
Yours more than mine.
If that's even possible.

805
00:53:52,129 --> 00:53:55,621
Sorry? Hell,
these kids are fantastic.

806
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:58,794
I've heard more thank yous and
pleases in the past three days

807
00:53:58,869 --> 00:54:01,997
than I've heard in a
lifetime from those shmucks.

808
00:54:02,073 --> 00:54:04,541
And believe me,
no matter what they tell you,

809
00:54:04,608 --> 00:54:07,441
they're all trying to make
money off this thing, too.

810
00:54:07,511 --> 00:54:10,275
I saw Bob charge
a dollar to fill a bottle

811
00:54:10,348 --> 00:54:12,316
with water for
one of these kids.

812
00:54:12,383 --> 00:54:13,873
A dollar?
Yeah, can you believe it?

813
00:54:13,951 --> 00:54:17,648
A dollar. For water. Geez.

814
00:54:50,588 --> 00:54:52,317
Four extra.

815
00:54:54,225 --> 00:54:55,886
- Four.
- Yeah.

816
00:55:03,968 --> 00:55:06,835
Elliot. You're
Elliot Tiber, right?

817
00:55:06,904 --> 00:55:08,462
Yeah, that's me.

818
00:55:08,539 --> 00:55:10,803
How can I help you, Miss... Vilma.

819
00:55:10,875 --> 00:55:13,366
Vetty Von Vilma,
but you can call me Vilma.

820
00:55:13,444 --> 00:55:15,503
Vilma.
What brings you here?

821
00:55:15,579 --> 00:55:18,013
I'm supposed to
say hi from Steve.

822
00:55:18,082 --> 00:55:20,812
Steve?
From the Village?

823
00:55:20,885 --> 00:55:23,479
Steven?
He's gone now.

824
00:55:23,554 --> 00:55:26,853
Off to San Francisco with a flower
in his hair on his sugar daddy's lap.

825
00:55:26,924 --> 00:55:30,291
Yeah.
Actually, my ex-sugar daddy.

826
00:55:30,361 --> 00:55:33,159
Good riddance.
He does like them mean and rich,

827
00:55:33,230 --> 00:55:35,528
doesn't he, our Steven?
He's very...

828
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:39,592
Anyhow, he said you might be starting
some sort of a gay resort here.

829
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:44,073
Well, resorting as well as
reclining is my specialty.

830
00:55:44,141 --> 00:55:46,575
And as I was on my way to
visit my mother in Buffalo,

831
00:55:46,644 --> 00:55:48,407
I thought I'd stop by.

832
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:51,073
Look what I stumbled into.

833
00:55:51,148 --> 00:55:55,710
By the way, those clowns you and
your dear parents chased off...

834
00:55:55,786 --> 00:55:58,448
Not nice people. I know.

835
00:55:58,522 --> 00:56:01,889
I was playing the horses,
if you know what I mean,

836
00:56:01,959 --> 00:56:04,223
over by the racetrack
in Monticello.

837
00:56:04,295 --> 00:56:05,922
Nice bedroom community,
actually,

838
00:56:05,996 --> 00:56:08,794
until that bunch tried to
confiscate my earnings.

839
00:56:08,866 --> 00:56:11,630
You think they'll
be back? Here?

840
00:56:11,702 --> 00:56:16,196
All I can say is you need help.
What kind of help?

841
00:56:21,111 --> 00:56:22,442
Oh. Um...

842
00:56:22,513 --> 00:56:25,448
That's nothing.
You should see what I'm packing up here.

843
00:56:27,518 --> 00:56:28,985
My God.
I know.

844
00:56:29,053 --> 00:56:31,851
But keeping to the subject
at hand for the moment,

845
00:56:31,922 --> 00:56:36,359
you do need some real security around
here. And you're real security?

846
00:56:37,895 --> 00:56:39,988
What?
Well, you don't look...

847
00:56:40,064 --> 00:56:43,556
Okay, I may be a grandfather, but...
You're a grandfather?

848
00:56:43,634 --> 00:56:47,161
I married young, the night
before I shipped out for Korea.

849
00:56:47,238 --> 00:56:49,706
You were in Korea?
Semper fi, you little prick.

850
00:56:49,773 --> 00:56:51,502
Sergeant, U.S. Marine Corps.

851
00:56:52,309 --> 00:56:53,867
No kidding.
Yeah.

852
00:56:53,944 --> 00:56:54,933
Wow.

853
00:56:56,914 --> 00:57:01,783
That's me with the cigar.
The other one was the love of my life.

854
00:57:02,987 --> 00:57:04,454
Killed. Sniper.

855
00:57:05,222 --> 00:57:07,713
I went out on patrol,
found the Chinese pissant who did it,

856
00:57:07,791 --> 00:57:10,089
and broke his neck with my own hands.
Jesus.

857
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:11,491
Actually, I made
that last part up.

858
00:57:11,562 --> 00:57:13,291
But I would have if I'd gotten
a hold of the son of a bitch,

859
00:57:13,364 --> 00:57:15,389
and I'd do it today
if I found him.

860
00:57:17,601 --> 00:57:21,367
Vilma, you're hired.
Thank you.

861
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:23,963
Welcome aboard.
You won't regret it.

862
00:57:25,142 --> 00:57:29,340
Do you need some kind of uniform?
I've got uniforms, baby.

863
00:57:37,688 --> 00:57:38,677
Wow.

864
00:57:46,330 --> 00:57:49,891
Hey, Elliot.
She's a beautiful ride.

865
00:57:51,502 --> 00:57:53,402
Great way to
commute to Max's.

866
00:57:55,372 --> 00:57:58,830
That's a nice suit.
It's for the press. Conference.

867
00:57:58,909 --> 00:58:00,376
Sure.

868
00:58:01,579 --> 00:58:04,446
You okay?
A little nervous.

869
00:58:04,515 --> 00:58:05,846
Got just the thing.

870
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:12,855
You know, actually,
I'm feeling a little nauseous.

871
00:58:12,990 --> 00:58:15,925
Hey, grass is a perfect
cure for nausea.

872
00:58:17,027 --> 00:58:18,654
Really?
Seriously.

873
00:58:19,597 --> 00:58:20,586
Well...

874
00:58:23,434 --> 00:58:25,095
Yeah.

875
00:58:25,803 --> 00:58:28,271
It's good shit.
Very good shit.

876
00:58:32,209 --> 00:58:34,677
...and in these next few days
before the concert,

877
00:58:34,745 --> 00:58:36,872
we'll also provide
daily briefings

878
00:58:36,947 --> 00:58:39,006
and we're all here to
provide any follow up.

879
00:58:39,083 --> 00:58:42,917
But without further delay,
here is Mr. Elliot Tiber,

880
00:58:42,987 --> 00:58:44,477
the proprietor of
the El Monaco,

881
00:58:44,555 --> 00:58:46,682
President of the Bethel
Chamber of Commerce,

882
00:58:46,757 --> 00:58:50,625
and a community liaison for
Woodstock Ventures. Mr. Tiber.

883
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,934
Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen of the press.

884
00:58:58,002 --> 00:59:00,835
Do you have a legal permit
for the concert in White Lake?

885
00:59:03,107 --> 00:59:07,669
There will be a music and
arts festival held here on
August 15th, 16th, and 17th,

886
00:59:07,745 --> 00:59:10,213
part of my ongoing yearly
music and arts festivals

887
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:14,114
that have made White Lake
the truly international
cultural center that it is.

888
00:59:14,184 --> 00:59:16,152
As evidenced by the fact that you
wonderful ladies and gentlemen

889
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:18,347
of the press are
here to report on it.

890
00:59:18,422 --> 00:59:20,390
I have been proud to be the
artistic director of the festival

891
00:59:20,457 --> 00:59:22,322
in its prior incarnations,
and I hope that...

892
00:59:22,393 --> 00:59:25,021
Yes, but do you have a legal
permit for the concert?

893
00:59:28,232 --> 00:59:29,221
Of course.

894
00:59:30,034 --> 00:59:32,298
Need I remind you,
I am the President.

895
00:59:32,369 --> 00:59:35,736
I am the President of the
Bethel Chamber of Commerce.

896
00:59:35,806 --> 00:59:39,674
Would a leading civic leader such
as myself break his own laws?

897
00:59:39,743 --> 00:59:41,370
That doesn't make sense.

898
00:59:41,445 --> 00:59:43,845
Do you realize that the
police are now estimating

899
00:59:43,914 --> 00:59:48,044
that perhaps as many as 100,000
people will attend the concert?

900
00:59:48,118 --> 00:59:51,519
What will your people here in
White Lake think of 100,000 hippies

901
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:53,579
and what they
will do to the town?

902
00:59:55,793 --> 00:59:58,523
My people?
You say my people.

903
00:59:59,396 --> 01:00:02,559
Native White Lakians
cannot be considered people,

904
01:00:04,001 --> 01:00:06,367
you know,
mine or anyone else's.

905
01:00:09,506 --> 01:00:12,475
Can you tell us something
about these free programs

906
01:00:12,543 --> 01:00:14,738
for the local community
happening this week?

907
01:00:14,812 --> 01:00:17,872
Will there be a cap on the
number of tickets sold,

908
01:00:17,948 --> 01:00:21,679
and how will you deal with people
showing up without tickets?

909
01:00:24,922 --> 01:00:27,117
You are asking
about freedom.

910
01:00:27,925 --> 01:00:29,756
The very essence
of the enterprise,

911
01:00:29,827 --> 01:00:33,263
of all enterprise,
especially free enterprise.

912
01:00:34,198 --> 01:00:37,861
And freedom
could be considered,

913
01:00:37,935 --> 01:00:42,929
and is often considered, you know,
to be just another word for being free.

914
01:00:44,074 --> 01:00:49,034
Therefore, there will be
no train to freedom. Train
has already left the station.

915
01:00:51,949 --> 01:00:56,215
How can the music be free when the
people of White Lake are enchained?

916
01:00:56,954 --> 01:00:57,943
Huh?

917
01:00:58,021 --> 01:01:01,047
If one song is not free,
then all songs are not free.

918
01:01:01,125 --> 01:01:05,323
That is why we are going to free
all the songs in White Lake.

919
01:01:05,395 --> 01:01:08,193
Any idea what the hell
is going on here?

920
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:19,471
Wow, Elliot.
You stood strong up there.

921
01:01:19,543 --> 01:01:22,603
That freedom rap, yeah.
That was heavy.

922
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:27,343
Thanks, Mike. You smell good.
Like an apple fritter.

923
01:01:28,552 --> 01:01:29,849
Far out.

924
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:04,815
What's happening?

925
01:02:04,888 --> 01:02:08,187
Didn't you hear?
It's free, man.

926
01:02:08,692 --> 01:02:11,320
Come on.
The concert's free.

927
01:02:15,299 --> 01:02:18,564
Come on, let's go.
Stop. Here.

928
01:02:19,837 --> 01:02:21,600
That's it.
That's it.

929
01:02:22,806 --> 01:02:28,244
Come on. Let's go.
Let's go. Come on, let's go.

930
01:02:29,446 --> 01:02:30,435
Dad!

931
01:02:32,816 --> 01:02:33,805
Let's go.

932
01:02:36,553 --> 01:02:38,111
Come on.
We've got an artist here.

933
01:02:38,188 --> 01:02:42,420
He's been out here two hours already.
Won't budge.

934
01:02:42,492 --> 01:02:45,518
All right, come on.
Come here. Just wait.

935
01:02:46,864 --> 01:02:48,627
All right. Hold it!

936
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:05,344
Your dad says
you're a painter.

937
01:03:06,250 --> 01:03:08,081
When did he say that?

938
01:03:08,218 --> 01:03:13,588
I had him give me a tour
of the property, you know,
getting a lay of the land.

939
01:03:15,025 --> 01:03:18,552
He talked a lot about you,
about Brooklyn.

940
01:03:20,364 --> 01:03:26,269
He showed me some of his favorite
places, the oaks down by the lake.

941
01:03:27,871 --> 01:03:29,065
Nice.

942
01:03:29,139 --> 01:03:30,299
Wait.

943
01:03:30,741 --> 01:03:34,472
Are you sure that was my dad?
Maybe it was somebody else's?

944
01:03:38,115 --> 01:03:40,345
I mean, he doesn't have any
favorite places here, he hates it.

945
01:03:40,417 --> 01:03:41,714
He doesn't talk.

946
01:03:41,785 --> 01:03:46,882
I didn't say it was therapy or anything,
you know. It was just chatting.

947
01:03:46,957 --> 01:03:49,585
Chatting?
His mind must be going.

948
01:03:52,129 --> 01:03:55,496
Don't worry, Elliot.
I'll keep an eye on him.

949
01:03:56,500 --> 01:04:00,436
If he starts to laugh or smile
or anything suspicious like that,

950
01:04:00,504 --> 01:04:02,233
I'll let you know.

951
01:04:04,007 --> 01:04:05,872
Yeah. You do that.

952
01:04:11,381 --> 01:04:15,715
In fact, I have to go collect his bat,
we've got dawn patrol.

953
01:04:18,355 --> 01:04:19,549
Vilma?

954
01:04:23,894 --> 01:04:29,230
Does my dad know,
you know, what you are?

955
01:04:34,004 --> 01:04:35,232
Elliot.

956
01:04:36,540 --> 01:04:38,030
I know what I am.

957
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:42,242
That does make it easier for
everyone else, doesn't it?

958
01:04:54,124 --> 01:04:56,524
After the concert,
we've got tables set up near the barn.

959
01:04:56,593 --> 01:04:58,754
I understand your mother
is preparing her specialty.

960
01:04:58,829 --> 01:05:00,160
Cholent? Oh, no.

961
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:02,357
And the Ladies Auxiliary
has made dessert.

962
01:05:02,432 --> 01:05:04,195
We just have to make sure
somebody rations them.

963
01:05:04,267 --> 01:05:06,360
There's a lot of hungry
kids out there.

964
01:05:06,436 --> 01:05:09,530
Don, I just want to say,
I have a feeling.

965
01:05:09,606 --> 01:05:11,198
Feelings?
Feelings are good.

966
01:05:11,274 --> 01:05:14,402
Get over to the south field,
find what-is-his-name,

967
01:05:14,478 --> 01:05:15,809
and round up all those...

968
01:05:15,879 --> 01:05:18,814
They don't really know where
to put all the sunflower seeds.

969
01:05:18,882 --> 01:05:21,510
How many sunflower seeds
did they buy?

970
01:05:23,387 --> 01:05:27,790
How many sunflower seeds
can you get into the back of
a triple-axle trailer truck?

971
01:05:27,858 --> 01:05:30,190
I'm not sure. I'm sorry.
We actually have another meeting...

972
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:32,319
Everybody's working
hard for...

973
01:05:32,396 --> 01:05:33,693
Yes. Very hard.

974
01:05:34,398 --> 01:05:36,332
Hey, John.
That's him.

975
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:38,527
That's the prick who told
everyone that the concert's free.

976
01:05:38,602 --> 01:05:39,694
Fuck the alfalfa...

977
01:05:39,770 --> 01:05:42,933
Considering that we haven't managed
to build a ticket booth yet,

978
01:05:43,006 --> 01:05:44,439
can't really
argue with him.

979
01:05:44,508 --> 01:05:47,170
It's incredible. Knocking down
the walls, and all kinds of stuff.

980
01:05:47,244 --> 01:05:48,711
Well, we gotta make
some space in here, but...

981
01:05:48,779 --> 01:05:51,179
Doris? Doris,
he doesn't... Doris?

982
01:05:51,248 --> 01:05:53,341
He doesn't even know
what a purchase order is.

983
01:05:53,517 --> 01:05:55,212
I'm trying to help organize
moving everybody

984
01:05:55,285 --> 01:05:57,480
from here in the horseshoe
up to the site.

985
01:05:57,554 --> 01:06:00,387
Trucks, trailers,
everything, gotta go.

986
01:06:00,457 --> 01:06:01,924
Gonna miss this place.

987
01:06:01,992 --> 01:06:05,052
Yeah, well,
we'll keep some rooms here.

988
01:06:05,128 --> 01:06:08,359
The one concern is the big
towers for the speakers.

989
01:06:08,432 --> 01:06:11,458
They're not staying up?
No, they're good. Solid.

990
01:06:11,535 --> 01:06:16,871
It's just that if there's rain,
lightning, well, might get a little...

991
01:06:17,107 --> 01:06:18,574
A little what?

992
01:06:18,642 --> 01:06:20,337
Electrical.
We're working on it.

993
01:06:20,410 --> 01:06:23,140
Yeah, we don't wanna
fry too much of the audience.

994
01:06:23,213 --> 01:06:25,579
Yeah, that's a good point, Joel.
Thank you, John.

995
01:06:25,649 --> 01:06:29,016
Hey. It's August.
It's not gonna rain.

996
01:06:29,086 --> 01:06:31,452
Remember, okay?
Rice, bananas,

997
01:06:31,521 --> 01:06:33,819
anything that's gonna
keep them from shitting.

998
01:06:33,890 --> 01:06:36,222
Because I'm worried
about our toilet numbers.

999
01:06:53,710 --> 01:06:57,168
Now we're together nearly
every single day, singin'

1000
01:06:57,247 --> 01:07:00,648
Do wah diddy diddy
dum diddy do

1001
01:07:00,717 --> 01:07:04,084
We're so happy and that's
how we're gonna stay, singin'

1002
01:07:04,154 --> 01:07:06,452
Do wah diddy diddy
dum diddy do

1003
01:07:06,523 --> 01:07:11,051
No, no one stole the car,
I just gotta keep it for a few days.

1004
01:07:11,128 --> 01:07:12,561
Sure, it's legal.

1005
01:07:12,629 --> 01:07:16,963
Everything is fine, Mom. Don't worry.
I've met so many beautiful people here.

1006
01:07:17,267 --> 01:07:18,825
Whoa-oh

1007
01:07:18,902 --> 01:07:21,928
Do wah diddy diddy
dum diddy do

1008
01:07:22,005 --> 01:07:25,634
Do wah diddy diddy
dum diddy do

1009
01:07:25,709 --> 01:07:28,803
Do wah diddy diddy
dum diddy do

1010
01:07:36,620 --> 01:07:40,181
Thank you.
Hairy Pretzel, thank you.

1011
01:07:40,257 --> 01:07:42,589
It's so great that you have
let us share your music

1012
01:07:42,659 --> 01:07:45,685
with all your friends and your parents,
here in White Lake.

1013
01:07:45,762 --> 01:07:47,320
Now we would like
to introduce to you

1014
01:07:47,397 --> 01:07:50,457
the resident theater artists,
here at the El Monaco this summer,

1015
01:07:50,534 --> 01:07:52,126
the Earthlight Players,

1016
01:07:52,202 --> 01:07:55,501
who have adapted Anton Chekhov's
classic, Three Sisters,

1017
01:07:55,572 --> 01:07:59,406
to a contemporary,
happening interpretation,

1018
01:07:59,476 --> 01:08:03,242
and they would like now to share a
part of that experience with you.

1019
01:08:03,313 --> 01:08:05,781
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Earthlight Players.

1020
01:08:17,594 --> 01:08:22,327
Artifice and imagination!
Truth and fiction!

1021
01:08:23,266 --> 01:08:24,893
The players play!

1022
01:08:25,502 --> 01:08:29,734
But you, the audience,
you sit and judge.

1023
01:08:29,806 --> 01:08:31,740
- You sit and judge.
- You sit and judge.

1024
01:08:31,808 --> 01:08:35,141
But the revolution requires
the roles must be reversed!

1025
01:08:36,379 --> 01:08:39,212
The players
are the judges now.

1026
01:08:39,983 --> 01:08:44,682
Your revelry must end, and your
souls will be bared for all to see.

1027
01:08:45,322 --> 01:08:49,122
Christ who died for you,
but not for me!

1028
01:08:49,192 --> 01:08:50,853
Now we are Christ!

1029
01:08:51,728 --> 01:08:55,425
Our nakedness
will reveal your own.

1030
01:08:55,498 --> 01:08:59,229
- Indecent legions of decency!
- lndecent legions of decency!

1031
01:08:59,302 --> 01:09:02,203
Fascist pornographers!
Fascist pornographers!

1032
01:09:02,272 --> 01:09:05,139
Racist warmongers!
Racist warmongers!

1033
01:09:05,208 --> 01:09:08,507
Republican cocksuckers!
Republican cocksuckers!

1034
01:09:08,578 --> 01:09:10,478
Indecent legions of decency!
Indecent legions of decency!

1035
01:09:12,182 --> 01:09:14,446
- Fascist pornographers!
- Fascist pornographers!

1036
01:09:17,020 --> 01:09:18,988
Put your clothes back on.

1037
01:09:22,559 --> 01:09:24,686
Billy. Billy.
Jesus Christ.

1038
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:31,326
Racist warmongers!

1039
01:09:33,870 --> 01:09:38,068
Fascist pornographers!
Fascist pornographers!

1040
01:09:39,276 --> 01:09:40,265
Billy!

1041
01:09:41,444 --> 01:09:43,412
Billy!
Get your ass down here!

1042
01:09:44,147 --> 01:09:46,138
Get your ass down here!

1043
01:09:50,220 --> 01:09:51,380
Billy!

1044
01:10:54,918 --> 01:10:56,783
- Everything is gone...
- Annie?

1045
01:10:57,387 --> 01:10:59,446
Elliot. Namaste.

1046
01:10:59,522 --> 01:11:01,922
Hi, Elliot.
Namaste, dear Elliot.

1047
01:11:08,064 --> 01:11:09,497
- Hey, Georgette.
- How are we doing?

1048
01:11:09,566 --> 01:11:10,999
Hey, Elliot.
Hey, guys.

1049
01:11:13,870 --> 01:11:15,098
Hey.

1050
01:11:15,171 --> 01:11:16,900
Here.
Hey.

1051
01:11:16,973 --> 01:11:18,167
Thanks.
All right.

1052
01:11:18,241 --> 01:11:20,709
Where we going with these?
Barn.

1053
01:11:20,777 --> 01:11:24,713
Stan and your theater guy set
up some medical volunteers.

1054
01:11:24,781 --> 01:11:27,773
The combination of the bare
feet and the brown acid...

1055
01:11:27,851 --> 01:11:29,409
Real.
Yeah.

1056
01:11:30,453 --> 01:11:34,412
Anyway, I hope you don't mind,
we just were grabbing everything we can.

1057
01:11:34,491 --> 01:11:36,288
And your mom gave me
these blankets.

1058
01:11:36,359 --> 01:11:39,089
My mom? Gave?

1059
01:11:39,162 --> 01:11:41,460
Yeah. She's cool.

1060
01:11:52,308 --> 01:11:53,297
Hey.

1061
01:11:54,177 --> 01:11:55,405
Hey, Dad?

1062
01:11:56,813 --> 01:11:57,802
Dad.

1063
01:11:57,914 --> 01:12:00,280
The New York State Thruway
has been backed up all the way

1064
01:12:00,350 --> 01:12:02,614
from the George Washington
Bridge to the Catskills exits,

1065
01:12:02,685 --> 01:12:05,176
and from there,
it's basically a parking lot.

1066
01:12:05,255 --> 01:12:07,018
Police are now planning
to put into effect

1067
01:12:07,090 --> 01:12:10,184
a first-ever emergency
closing of the entire Thruway.

1068
01:12:10,727 --> 01:12:13,025
We go now to John Stevens,
who is in the field...

1069
01:12:13,096 --> 01:12:14,757
Ma, you okay?

1070
01:12:14,831 --> 01:12:16,765
The nisht-gute...

1071
01:12:16,833 --> 01:12:18,460
Evil!

1072
01:12:18,535 --> 01:12:21,163
You seen the chicken legs
on some of these hairy people?

1073
01:12:21,905 --> 01:12:23,736
Mom, they're kids,
not evil spirits.

1074
01:12:23,807 --> 01:12:25,035
You don't know!

1075
01:12:25,108 --> 01:12:29,306
They've made all the roads one-way
now, Elli, one-way just to Max's.

1076
01:12:29,379 --> 01:12:30,744
God forbid,
what if your father

1077
01:12:30,814 --> 01:12:32,679
should have a heart attack
from all this running around?

1078
01:12:32,749 --> 01:12:34,614
He couldn't get
to the hospital.

1079
01:12:35,418 --> 01:12:37,181
You're really worried
about him, aren't you?

1080
01:12:37,253 --> 01:12:40,654
Him? It's you
who brought this.

1081
01:12:40,723 --> 01:12:43,157
How will you live
with the guilt?

1082
01:13:03,713 --> 01:13:07,513
Hit him in the kisser,
hit him in the guts, nine, ten, out!

1083
01:13:16,192 --> 01:13:18,023
Hey. Give me three.

1084
01:13:18,495 --> 01:13:19,621
How you doing, Dad?

1085
01:13:19,696 --> 01:13:21,323
How should I be doing?

1086
01:13:21,397 --> 01:13:25,629
I haven't slept in three days, my hip
is killing me, and the beer's warm.

1087
01:13:26,669 --> 01:13:30,161
So, you're good? Yeah, I'm good.
Hand me that bottle.

1088
01:13:32,442 --> 01:13:33,636
You're ready for one?

1089
01:13:33,710 --> 01:13:36,042
I thought you'd never ask.

1090
01:13:38,014 --> 01:13:39,311
How you doing, kid?

1091
01:13:40,350 --> 01:13:43,808
I haven't slept in three days,
the beer's warm,

1092
01:13:43,887 --> 01:13:46,822
I'm actually not making this up,
but my hip is killing me.

1093
01:13:46,890 --> 01:13:48,187
So, you're good?

1094
01:14:10,113 --> 01:14:11,705
Come on, Elliot.

1095
01:15:15,378 --> 01:15:18,609
I'm standing near the intersection
of Route 17B and 55,

1096
01:15:18,681 --> 01:15:22,344
where state authorities now estimate
that perhaps half a million kids

1097
01:15:22,418 --> 01:15:24,249
have already made it
to the White Lake area,

1098
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:27,687
and there's another million trying to
get here who will just never make it,

1099
01:15:27,757 --> 01:15:31,420
putting upstate communities in an
uproar at this major hippie invasion.

1100
01:15:34,364 --> 01:15:35,353
Bob!

1101
01:15:36,032 --> 01:15:37,021
Bob!

1102
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:39,461
What's this all about?

1103
01:15:39,535 --> 01:15:43,471
We got the permit pulled, you idiot!
We're shutting this thing down!

1104
01:15:43,606 --> 01:15:46,666
But there's a half a million
people over at Max's.

1105
01:15:46,743 --> 01:15:48,005
How do you think
they're gonna react?

1106
01:15:48,077 --> 01:15:50,136
That's the same thing
the cops said...

1107
01:15:50,213 --> 01:15:53,478
Before they laughed at us
as if we were children.

1108
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:55,813
So we're doing it
ourselves!

1109
01:15:55,885 --> 01:15:56,977
Right.

1110
01:15:59,455 --> 01:16:00,820
Hi, Elliot!

1111
01:16:09,699 --> 01:16:10,688
Come on.

1112
01:16:11,934 --> 01:16:13,731
Not so tough anymore,
are you?

1113
01:16:13,803 --> 01:16:15,293
Come on, you.

1114
01:16:16,039 --> 01:16:17,336
Go to hell!

1115
01:16:19,242 --> 01:16:20,607
Fuck you, old man!

1116
01:16:20,677 --> 01:16:22,042
You get off my property,

1117
01:16:22,111 --> 01:16:24,079
you thugs.
- You faggot freak.

1118
01:16:29,285 --> 01:16:30,445
Hippie lover!

1119
01:16:38,995 --> 01:16:41,463
This is where
we rinse the sheets.

1120
01:16:46,135 --> 01:16:47,261
Hey, brother.

1121
01:17:04,821 --> 01:17:06,152
You hear that?

1122
01:17:07,623 --> 01:17:08,885
It's starting.

1123
01:17:27,577 --> 01:17:28,635
Elli,

1124
01:17:30,213 --> 01:17:31,874
you should go.

1125
01:17:33,015 --> 01:17:34,539
What?

1126
01:17:34,617 --> 01:17:35,709
To Max's.

1127
01:17:36,419 --> 01:17:37,511
I can't.
You guys would...

1128
01:17:37,587 --> 01:17:39,714
We can take care
of things here.

1129
01:17:40,757 --> 01:17:42,384
Dad...
- You go.

1130
01:17:44,427 --> 01:17:46,088
Go see this thing.

1131
01:17:47,663 --> 01:17:48,652
Go.

1132
01:17:49,565 --> 01:17:52,295
See what the center
of the universe looks like.

1133
01:18:00,476 --> 01:18:02,910
Yeah, sure.

1134
01:18:25,434 --> 01:18:26,423
Wow.

1135
01:18:27,637 --> 01:18:31,232
Bet you thought you were just gonna
drive right up to the thing, huh?

1136
01:18:31,374 --> 01:18:33,934
Actually, my family,
we own the motel here.

1137
01:18:34,010 --> 01:18:35,500
The El Monaco, huh?

1138
01:18:35,578 --> 01:18:38,547
So you're the guy they're all
blaming for bringing all this here.

1139
01:18:38,614 --> 01:18:42,141
Governor just declared this
whole county a disaster area.

1140
01:18:42,218 --> 01:18:46,917
Yeah, it's a disaster.
I'm the disaster guy, officially.

1141
01:18:47,323 --> 01:18:51,282
No kidding. I was looking
forward to just coming up here

1142
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:54,022
and clubbing a bunch of
hippies over the head.

1143
01:18:54,096 --> 01:18:56,860
But instead,
I don't know.

1144
01:18:56,933 --> 01:18:59,094
I must be getting
high off the fumes.

1145
01:18:59,168 --> 01:19:00,226
Peace, man.

1146
01:19:01,604 --> 01:19:03,765
See what I mean?

1147
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:05,000
Groovy.

1148
01:19:05,942 --> 01:19:08,035
I think I'm gonna head over
and check it all out.

1149
01:19:08,110 --> 01:19:10,908
On foot? It'll take you
all afternoon with this crowd.

1150
01:19:10,980 --> 01:19:12,140
Here.

1151
01:19:12,215 --> 01:19:13,273
Thanks.

1152
01:20:33,162 --> 01:20:34,390
Officer.

1153
01:20:36,432 --> 01:20:38,627
What do you say to all those
young men fighting in Vietnam

1154
01:20:38,701 --> 01:20:40,566
while you're here
enjoying yourselves?

1155
01:20:40,636 --> 01:20:43,969
We're waging peace, man.
We're teaching peace to the world.

1156
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:47,100
You think they're gonna understand that?
While they're bleeding and dying?

1157
01:20:47,176 --> 01:20:48,768
Why won't they...

1158
01:20:48,844 --> 01:20:50,812
Find your buddy, girls!

1159
01:20:57,420 --> 01:21:00,548
The innocent people
of North Vietnam...

1160
01:21:00,623 --> 01:21:02,989
- Bombs for peace!
- Bombs for peace!

1161
01:21:03,059 --> 01:21:05,152
War bombs for peace!
War bombs for peace!

1162
01:21:08,798 --> 01:21:10,527
Yeah,
dream on there, buddy.

1163
01:21:10,599 --> 01:21:12,157
Hey, it could happen.

1164
01:21:28,484 --> 01:21:30,918
I know you can do it.
Come on, just for fun.

1165
01:21:32,688 --> 01:21:35,282
Okay, thank you.
Thank you, Sister.

1166
01:21:35,458 --> 01:21:36,550
Peace to you.

1167
01:21:36,625 --> 01:21:37,785
Thank you.

1168
01:21:37,860 --> 01:21:39,384
God bless you.

1169
01:22:14,930 --> 01:22:16,761
Come on, burn them, sisters!

1170
01:22:16,832 --> 01:22:18,732
Burn your bras and read this!

1171
01:22:27,309 --> 01:22:28,867
You've gotta join
this demonstration.

1172
01:22:30,246 --> 01:22:33,340
Stop the pollution.
Keep our rivers clean.

1173
01:23:25,534 --> 01:23:27,161
Hey, man.

1174
01:23:28,237 --> 01:23:30,068
- Hey.
- Hey.

1175
01:23:30,139 --> 01:23:31,800
You look thirsty.

1176
01:23:32,908 --> 01:23:34,034
I am.

1177
01:23:38,314 --> 01:23:39,542
Thanks.

1178
01:23:49,992 --> 01:23:52,290
Have you guys been down
to see the festival yet?

1179
01:23:52,361 --> 01:23:55,023
We're cool,
and we'll get there again.

1180
01:23:55,464 --> 01:23:57,989
We got to the top of the hill,
and looked down at the sea,

1181
01:23:58,067 --> 01:24:02,731
and the tiny little people on stage with
their waves of tiny electric voices.

1182
01:24:02,805 --> 01:24:07,139
Like ants making thunder,
man. It was cool.

1183
01:24:08,310 --> 01:24:10,938
But you couldn't really tell
who was jamming down there.

1184
01:24:11,013 --> 01:24:12,173
And we left our trip
in the car.

1185
01:24:12,248 --> 01:24:16,548
And the shit they're passing
around down there, not quality.

1186
01:24:17,620 --> 01:24:19,349
Ours is beautiful.

1187
01:24:21,891 --> 01:24:25,622
I see you have California plates.
Is that where you're from?

1188
01:24:25,694 --> 01:24:27,218
There, and New Mexico...

1189
01:24:27,296 --> 01:24:28,923
And Oregon.

1190
01:24:29,899 --> 01:24:31,526
You're from everywhere.

1191
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:32,999
We're from everywhere.

1192
01:24:33,569 --> 01:24:35,469
You're from everywhere.

1193
01:24:36,172 --> 01:24:37,764
I'm from here.

1194
01:24:39,041 --> 01:24:40,633
You're from here, man.

1195
01:24:40,709 --> 01:24:41,767
That's so cool.

1196
01:24:44,046 --> 01:24:45,411
I guess so.

1197
01:24:46,215 --> 01:24:49,207
Man,
you're amazingly from here.

1198
01:24:54,757 --> 01:24:59,558
Here, man,
take a ride to here and now.

1199
01:25:00,629 --> 01:25:02,290
Eight miles high.

1200
01:25:05,034 --> 01:25:07,764
I'm actually
a little afraid of heights.

1201
01:25:12,341 --> 01:25:13,865
What the heck.

1202
01:25:33,128 --> 01:25:34,152
Hey.

1203
01:25:34,830 --> 01:25:36,422
Come on in, sit.

1204
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:12,492
So...

1205
01:26:14,136 --> 01:26:15,228
Yeah?

1206
01:26:16,472 --> 01:26:18,372
You sure that was acid?

1207
01:26:18,707 --> 01:26:20,140
I didn't really taste any...

1208
01:26:20,209 --> 01:26:22,143
It just takes a while.

1209
01:26:23,846 --> 01:26:26,815
Hey, let's listen to some
of our own sounds.

1210
01:27:55,571 --> 01:27:56,595
What? What's that?

1211
01:27:57,139 --> 01:27:59,630
Hey, it's okay.
Just breathe.

1212
01:27:59,708 --> 01:28:01,039
Hey, it's okay,
just breathe.

1213
01:28:01,110 --> 01:28:03,738
It's okay, just breathe.
Just breathe.

1214
01:28:25,367 --> 01:28:28,029
Hey, it's okay.

1215
01:28:29,705 --> 01:28:30,967
It's okay.

1216
01:28:52,461 --> 01:28:53,951
Just breathe.

1217
01:29:04,039 --> 01:29:05,700
Where are my arms?

1218
01:29:06,008 --> 01:29:08,408
Where's my arm?
It's right here.

1219
01:29:21,990 --> 01:29:23,480
Just breathe.

1220
01:30:25,020 --> 01:30:30,151
Hey. Let's go down to the ocean.
Let's go swim.

1221
01:32:21,970 --> 01:32:25,167
Elliot. You look well.

1222
01:32:26,375 --> 01:32:28,741
I want you to meet the ladies
from St. Paul's in Liberty.

1223
01:32:28,810 --> 01:32:30,710
They made 5,000 sandwiches!

1224
01:32:30,779 --> 01:32:32,440
Vilma,
don't exaggerate.

1225
01:32:32,547 --> 01:32:33,707
We made 4,000.

1226
01:32:33,782 --> 01:32:37,513
Honey, please. Anything more
than one is a miracle in my book.

1227
01:32:46,728 --> 01:32:50,357
My God! Look at him!
Where have you been all day and night?

1228
01:32:50,766 --> 01:32:52,563
How was the concert?

1229
01:32:53,702 --> 01:32:58,002
Well, I met some friends
on the way there.

1230
01:32:59,741 --> 01:33:02,471
It was great.
It was great.

1231
01:33:04,680 --> 01:33:06,477
Are you hungry?

1232
01:33:06,548 --> 01:33:07,606
I'm starving.

1233
01:33:23,098 --> 01:33:25,191
So I was thinking,
when this is over...

1234
01:33:25,267 --> 01:33:26,529
What a mess.

1235
01:33:27,035 --> 01:33:29,265
It'll take months
to clean up.

1236
01:33:31,039 --> 01:33:34,065
We can keep some of these
new people on, right?

1237
01:33:35,010 --> 01:33:37,103
We can afford the help now.

1238
01:33:39,781 --> 01:33:41,908
And with the place paid off,

1239
01:33:43,218 --> 01:33:46,676
maybe it's time you thought
about some permanent staff.

1240
01:33:48,356 --> 01:33:52,190
Some people to help run the place,
make some improvements.

1241
01:33:55,864 --> 01:33:58,594
What are you talking about?
That's why we have you.

1242
01:34:04,005 --> 01:34:07,497
I'm just saying. I was thinking when
this is over, with all the money now,

1243
01:34:07,576 --> 01:34:10,010
I could take a trip.
And where did you get those pajamas?

1244
01:34:10,078 --> 01:34:12,376
You're not going anywhere
dressed like that.

1245
01:34:21,623 --> 01:34:28,153
We've made brownies. Wonderful brownies.
Very special brownies. Elliot?

1246
01:34:29,264 --> 01:34:30,856
We'll take a pass.

1247
01:34:34,302 --> 01:34:35,462
Right.

1248
01:34:43,478 --> 01:34:45,173
You see, Jake?
That's just like him.

1249
01:34:45,247 --> 01:34:47,238
He doesn't want dessert,
but does he think to ask his mother?

1250
01:34:47,315 --> 01:34:49,545
You know what?
That's enough.

1251
01:34:49,985 --> 01:34:54,149
You know, I'm the only one here,
out of hundreds and hundreds

1252
01:34:54,222 --> 01:34:58,886
and hundreds of thousands of people,
who's having breakfast with his parents!

1253
01:35:01,096 --> 01:35:03,894
Do you think Janis Joplin's
mom is standing backstage
telling her to tuck her,

1254
01:35:03,965 --> 01:35:06,456
I don't know, her whiskey bottle
back into her pocket or something?

1255
01:35:06,535 --> 01:35:09,368
Or Jimi Hendrix's mom is
telling him to wash his hair?

1256
01:35:09,437 --> 01:35:12,634
I'm gonna lie down, then I'm going
to Max's and I'm gonna enjoy myself.

1257
01:35:12,707 --> 01:35:15,938
And you know what? Go ahead.
I'd love to see you eat a brownie.

1258
01:35:16,011 --> 01:35:17,774
You should have two!

1259
01:35:31,193 --> 01:35:32,285
Elli!

1260
01:35:49,311 --> 01:35:51,279
- Hey, Elliot.
- Hey.

1261
01:35:51,847 --> 01:35:53,610
See you guys later.

1262
01:36:10,432 --> 01:36:11,524
Billy?

1263
01:36:15,537 --> 01:36:17,630
Man,
I remember this hill.

1264
01:36:19,674 --> 01:36:23,201
Remember remember, or, like,
Vietnam flashback remember?

1265
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:27,248
Remember remember, man.

1266
01:36:29,451 --> 01:36:35,913
Homecoming. Senior year.
We fucking massacred Monticello.

1267
01:36:37,626 --> 01:36:42,290
I caught like three touchdown passes.
Rum and Cokes.

1268
01:36:44,532 --> 01:36:48,161
And we fucking tipped
three of Yasgur's cows,

1269
01:36:48,236 --> 01:36:51,865
man, right there,
at the top of that hill.

1270
01:36:54,576 --> 01:36:56,544
And Shirley Livingstone,

1271
01:36:58,113 --> 01:37:01,446
man, right there,
at the top of that hill.

1272
01:37:02,117 --> 01:37:04,312
Wait a second.
That was you?

1273
01:37:06,688 --> 01:37:07,712
Was.

1274
01:37:12,627 --> 01:37:13,651
Is.

1275
01:37:16,898 --> 01:37:20,061
And that's
the Shirley Livingstone,

1276
01:37:20,135 --> 01:37:21,932
the one who works
at the animal hospital?

1277
01:37:26,308 --> 01:37:27,366
Yeah.

1278
01:37:29,611 --> 01:37:31,408
We were engaged, man.

1279
01:37:37,986 --> 01:37:40,716
Come on, man.
I love this fucking hill.

1280
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:20,052
Billy!

1281
01:38:49,624 --> 01:38:51,353
I love this hill!

1282
01:38:51,426 --> 01:38:53,155
We love this hill!

1283
01:39:08,543 --> 01:39:11,011
The prodigal son returns.

1284
01:39:15,150 --> 01:39:16,708
Well, you know,

1285
01:39:19,754 --> 01:39:23,588
I didn't quite,
you know, go.

1286
01:39:25,794 --> 01:39:27,056
I got it.

1287
01:39:29,197 --> 01:39:31,859
I'm happy to see you,
Elliot. Come on.

1288
01:39:33,301 --> 01:39:36,293
I want you to meet some
very, very groovy people.

1289
01:39:41,476 --> 01:39:43,808
You gave them
the hash brownies?

1290
01:39:44,112 --> 01:39:46,444
They told me
you said I should.

1291
01:39:47,348 --> 01:39:48,838
How many?

1292
01:39:48,917 --> 01:39:50,009
Four each.

1293
01:39:59,327 --> 01:40:03,195
Elliot! My baby!

1294
01:40:04,399 --> 01:40:05,730
Her baby!

1295
01:40:09,304 --> 01:40:14,332
My little baby. My filthy baby boy.
Give Mamma some of that dirt.

1296
01:42:23,137 --> 01:42:24,195
Dad.

1297
01:42:26,107 --> 01:42:31,044
She got up in her sleep,
walked over there and...

1298
01:42:31,112 --> 01:42:33,012
What's with the money?

1299
01:42:33,781 --> 01:42:35,612
We've been depositing everything
that's come in this week.

1300
01:42:35,683 --> 01:42:37,878
Where did
all that come from?

1301
01:42:52,100 --> 01:42:53,124
Ma, what the hell?

1302
01:42:53,201 --> 01:42:55,260
Don't come near me,
you two.

1303
01:42:55,837 --> 01:42:57,896
But what...
This is mine.

1304
01:42:58,573 --> 01:43:00,768
It's my savings
for 20 years.

1305
01:43:02,343 --> 01:43:04,004
It's my savings.

1306
01:43:05,013 --> 01:43:09,313
Jesus,
how much you got there?

1307
01:43:10,251 --> 01:43:12,151
None of your business.

1308
01:43:19,594 --> 01:43:21,687
$97,000.

1309
01:43:24,732 --> 01:43:26,029
$97,000.

1310
01:43:27,135 --> 01:43:28,898
Dad, did you know
about this?

1311
01:43:28,970 --> 01:43:30,733
You think she'd tell me?

1312
01:43:38,946 --> 01:43:40,846
You'd have let
the bank foreclose?

1313
01:43:43,151 --> 01:43:45,449
Let me put all my earnings
into this place.

1314
01:43:47,689 --> 01:43:49,020
And you...

1315
01:43:53,161 --> 01:43:54,253
Elli.

1316
01:43:56,331 --> 01:44:00,734
Why does it matter?
We're rich now.

1317
01:44:30,465 --> 01:44:32,160
Elli, I was scared.

1318
01:44:38,840 --> 01:44:39,898
Mom.

1319
01:44:45,079 --> 01:44:47,707
I've got to fix your father his lunch.

1320
01:45:01,362 --> 01:45:03,762
- Hey, man.
- What do you think of the kids here?

1321
01:45:03,831 --> 01:45:08,097
I think it's great. I got one here
myself and I got one in Vietnam,

1322
01:45:08,169 --> 01:45:10,603
and I wish he were
here in the mud.

1323
01:45:22,283 --> 01:45:24,274
- Hey, Elliot.
- What?

1324
01:45:24,385 --> 01:45:27,320
Just come around.
Stay on the wood.

1325
01:45:35,496 --> 01:45:38,090
Yeah,
everything's electric now.

1326
01:45:42,970 --> 01:45:44,597
What are you up to?

1327
01:45:44,672 --> 01:45:47,266
Thought I'd try to see
the concert finally.

1328
01:45:49,143 --> 01:45:53,842
Maybe later.
They can't get anyone to play right now.

1329
01:45:53,915 --> 01:45:55,780
There's too many shocks.

1330
01:45:55,850 --> 01:45:56,874
That's a bummer.

1331
01:46:00,354 --> 01:46:02,151
How's your day going?

1332
01:46:03,591 --> 01:46:04,683
Uh...

1333
01:46:07,395 --> 01:46:08,521
Yeah.

1334
01:46:09,096 --> 01:46:13,931
No, no.
My family, you know...

1335
01:46:14,001 --> 01:46:15,025
Sorry.

1336
01:46:15,102 --> 01:46:19,471
It's trivial compared to what
you guys are going through.

1337
01:46:21,342 --> 01:46:25,472
Maybe it's the most important thing
happening in the whole universe.

1338
01:46:25,713 --> 01:46:27,476
How do you know?

1339
01:46:27,548 --> 01:46:31,075
I'm pretty sure it's trivial,
you know, in perspective.

1340
01:46:32,186 --> 01:46:35,952
Perspective is what
shuts out the universe.

1341
01:46:37,124 --> 01:46:39,991
Everyone with their
little perspective.

1342
01:46:41,429 --> 01:46:43,294
It keeps the love out.

1343
01:46:47,735 --> 01:46:53,935
I'm so tired. I'm starting to talk
like that swami what's-his-face.

1344
01:46:56,077 --> 01:46:57,305
Far out.

1345
01:47:03,251 --> 01:47:05,082
Anyway, I'll see you.

1346
01:47:45,927 --> 01:47:46,985
Yes?

1347
01:47:56,404 --> 01:47:57,769
Come on in.

1348
01:48:05,046 --> 01:48:06,673
You're up early.

1349
01:48:08,082 --> 01:48:09,709
I couldn't sleep.

1350
01:48:12,119 --> 01:48:13,381
Hey, Dad.

1351
01:48:16,290 --> 01:48:19,487
I was gonna come say goodbye.
I hope that's okay.

1352
01:48:22,697 --> 01:48:23,823
Listen.

1353
01:48:26,634 --> 01:48:27,623
Sit.

1354
01:48:44,919 --> 01:48:47,217
A month ago,
I was a dying man.

1355
01:48:50,858 --> 01:48:55,056
I would think to myself,
"It's nice of Elli to come back here

1356
01:48:55,129 --> 01:48:57,256
"to tend to a dying man."

1357
01:48:59,233 --> 01:49:02,293
Who knows?
Maybe tomorrow I'll be dead.

1358
01:49:05,106 --> 01:49:06,266
But now,

1359
01:49:09,543 --> 01:49:10,771
I'm alive.

1360
01:49:13,648 --> 01:49:15,172
You understand?

1361
01:49:18,252 --> 01:49:19,241
No.

1362
01:49:22,256 --> 01:49:28,126
It's because of you.
Because of you I'm alive.

1363
01:49:30,831 --> 01:49:35,165
And what should I want now,
but for you, my son, to live, too?

1364
01:49:37,571 --> 01:49:38,765
Huh?

1365
01:49:38,839 --> 01:49:40,898
That's not so much to ask.

1366
01:49:43,911 --> 01:49:46,004
No, it isn't.

1367
01:49:48,716 --> 01:49:53,119
They're all starting to leave,
the young people.

1368
01:49:55,690 --> 01:49:59,592
Who knows where?
They don't even know.

1369
01:50:01,495 --> 01:50:05,454
And now you're one of them.
You go.

1370
01:50:09,437 --> 01:50:14,170
I'll stay in touch.
I'll be back.

1371
01:50:17,878 --> 01:50:20,005
Yeah, sure you will.

1372
01:50:24,652 --> 01:50:26,142
Elliot.

1373
01:50:27,588 --> 01:50:29,317
My hip, my...

1374
01:50:43,404 --> 01:50:45,269
Elli, that business
with your mother...

1375
01:50:45,339 --> 01:50:47,330
Don't worry about it.

1376
01:50:48,609 --> 01:50:49,633
No.

1377
01:50:50,044 --> 01:50:53,878
Dad, can you just
tell me one thing?

1378
01:50:54,815 --> 01:50:56,043
What?

1379
01:50:56,117 --> 01:50:57,141
How have you done it?

1380
01:50:58,119 --> 01:51:01,987
I mean, how have you lived
with her more than 40 years?

1381
01:51:05,359 --> 01:51:06,724
I love her.

1382
01:52:13,761 --> 01:52:16,559
Hey, Mike.
Elli, you made it.

1383
01:52:16,931 --> 01:52:20,799
Yeah, finally.
It's amazing.

1384
01:52:21,769 --> 01:52:23,760
It's beautiful, isn't it?

1385
01:52:32,346 --> 01:52:36,749
Hey, thanks for calling and welcoming
us to your international resort, man.

1386
01:52:36,817 --> 01:52:40,446
The whole world came,
and now everyone's pulling together.

1387
01:52:41,822 --> 01:52:45,053
Yeah. It's all just like
you said, Mike, isn't it?

1388
01:52:47,795 --> 01:52:51,196
Yeah, three days
of peace and music.

1389
01:52:55,402 --> 01:52:56,926
So what happens now?

1390
01:52:58,606 --> 01:53:00,005
Man, who knows?

1391
01:53:01,342 --> 01:53:03,936
Everybody's gotta chase
the money now, right?

1392
01:53:04,011 --> 01:53:05,035
Yeah.

1393
01:53:05,112 --> 01:53:08,673
We're all probably gonna sue each other,
but that's cool.

1394
01:53:09,650 --> 01:53:11,413
We'll figure it out.

1395
01:53:13,821 --> 01:53:15,379
What about you?

1396
01:53:16,056 --> 01:53:19,787
I don't know.
I put all my stuff in my car.

1397
01:53:20,895 --> 01:53:24,228
Hey, that's a sign.

1398
01:53:31,672 --> 01:53:35,574
If your car moves, come look me up.
I'm going to San Francisco.

1399
01:53:35,643 --> 01:53:37,201
Me and Chip
and some of the guys,

1400
01:53:37,278 --> 01:53:40,338
we're gonna help out
with a truly free concert.

1401
01:53:40,614 --> 01:53:42,980
It's gonna be even more
beautiful than this one.

1402
01:53:43,050 --> 01:53:44,540
Wow.
Yeah.

1403
01:53:46,220 --> 01:53:48,211
The Rolling Stones.

1404
01:53:48,289 --> 01:53:49,313
Rolling Stones?

1405
01:53:50,057 --> 01:53:52,548
Yeah, Stones.

1406
01:53:56,096 --> 01:53:57,461
Beautiful.

1407
01:54:05,973 --> 01:54:07,338
Beautiful.

1408
01:54:10,911 --> 01:54:12,242
Beautiful.
