1
00:00:48,047 --> 00:00:50,390
THE TIN DRUM

2
00:02:12,307 --> 00:02:15,768
I'll begin long before
I ever existed.

3
00:02:17,062 --> 00:02:21,023
When the time came
for my poor mama to be born,

4
00:02:21,149 --> 00:02:24,568
my grandmother, Anna Bronski,

5
00:02:24,695 --> 00:02:29,281
a young and unsuspecting girl,
sat in her four skirts

6
00:02:29,408 --> 00:02:31,951
at the edge of a potato field.

7
00:02:32,077 --> 00:02:35,538
That was in 1899,

8
00:02:35,664 --> 00:02:38,290
in the heart of Kashubia.

9
00:02:40,002 --> 00:02:42,920
Something was moving
on the horizon,

10
00:02:43,046 --> 00:02:45,256
as if jumping about.

11
00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:06,986
I beg you!

12
00:03:47,778 --> 00:03:50,946
Anybody come this way?

13
00:03:51,073 --> 00:03:52,573
Name of Koljaiczek?

14
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:53,783
A firebug.

15
00:03:53,909 --> 00:03:55,993
Short with broad shoulders.

16
00:03:56,661 --> 00:04:00,414
I saw him.
Running like a bat out of hell.

17
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,957
Which way?

18
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:10,841
I don't believe it.

19
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:22,853
He's gone.

20
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:24,230
Must be in Bissau.

21
00:04:25,023 --> 00:04:26,107
If he's not here.

22
00:04:26,233 --> 00:04:27,358
Has to be one or the other.

23
00:04:27,484 --> 00:04:29,068
There's nowhere else.

24
00:04:32,155 --> 00:04:33,948
And now it's raining.

25
00:05:25,917 --> 00:05:27,877
All right, Koljaiczek.

26
00:05:28,003 --> 00:05:29,170
My name is Joseph.

27
00:05:46,938 --> 00:05:49,857
My grandfather was an arsonist.

28
00:05:50,692 --> 00:05:52,943
A repeat arsonist,

29
00:05:53,069 --> 00:05:57,865
because in all of West Prussia,
sawmills

30
00:05:57,991 --> 00:06:01,785
were the tinder for the blazing
nationalism of the Poles.

31
00:06:04,915 --> 00:06:09,418
Joseph and Anna
hid with the raftsmen

32
00:06:09,544 --> 00:06:12,004
for almost a year.

33
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:15,090
That's how long it took the police

34
00:06:15,217 --> 00:06:19,303
to catch up
with my grandfather.

35
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:23,682
Run!

36
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:40,074
Don't shoot him!

37
00:06:51,044 --> 00:06:53,629
After that dive,

38
00:06:53,755 --> 00:06:57,007
Koljaiczek was never seen again.

39
00:06:57,926 --> 00:07:00,761
Some say he drowned.

40
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:03,180
Others say

41
00:07:03,306 --> 00:07:05,140
he escaped to America,

42
00:07:05,267 --> 00:07:07,059
where, in Chicago,

43
00:07:07,185 --> 00:07:09,603
under the name of Joe Colchic,

44
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:11,939
he became a millionaire.

45
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:16,068
They say he made his pile in lumber,

46
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:19,405
in matches,

47
00:07:20,615 --> 00:07:25,160
and in fire insurance.

48
00:07:36,965 --> 00:07:38,882
As for my grandmother,

49
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,887
she sat year after year
in her four skirts,

50
00:07:44,014 --> 00:07:47,099
hawking her wares in the market.

51
00:07:49,227 --> 00:07:51,020
Geese!

52
00:07:51,146 --> 00:07:53,814
Not too fat and not too lean!

53
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,774
And she grew older.

54
00:07:57,694 --> 00:07:59,570
The First World War came,

55
00:07:59,696 --> 00:08:03,615
and instead of geese,
she had only turnips to sell.

56
00:08:17,005 --> 00:08:19,423
Turnips!

57
00:08:21,259 --> 00:08:24,470
My poor mama grew older too.

58
00:08:24,596 --> 00:08:27,973
She was worried
about her cousin Jan.

59
00:08:29,392 --> 00:08:31,477
Jan had been called to war,

60
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:34,396
but he wanted to be near her.

61
00:08:34,522 --> 00:08:36,940
- Name?
- Bronski, Jan.

62
00:08:37,067 --> 00:08:39,276
- Year?
- 1898.

63
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,779
Cough.

64
00:08:42,489 --> 00:08:44,073
Again.

65
00:08:47,202 --> 00:08:48,786
Rejected!

66
00:08:52,582 --> 00:08:55,751
No ass, no neck,
to the army I'm a wreck!

67
00:08:58,004 --> 00:09:00,214
For the first time, my mother

68
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:03,425
held her cousin Jan in her arms,

69
00:09:03,551 --> 00:09:05,052
and I doubt

70
00:09:05,178 --> 00:09:09,264
if they ever embraced more happily.

71
00:09:12,894 --> 00:09:16,647
This young wartime romance
was untroubled

72
00:09:16,773 --> 00:09:21,652
until the appearance of Mr. Alfred
Matzerath, born in the Rhineland.

73
00:09:21,778 --> 00:09:25,572
At the Silberhammer Hospital,

74
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:28,409
he was the favourite
of all the nurses.

75
00:09:29,786 --> 00:09:31,245
What did she say?

76
00:09:32,205 --> 00:09:35,749
She said you're a born cook,
Mr. Matzerath.

77
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:38,293
You know how to turn feelings
into soup.

78
00:09:56,479 --> 00:10:00,357
The war had spent itself.

79
00:10:00,483 --> 00:10:03,026
Danzig was declared a Free State.

80
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:06,822
The Poles
were given their own post office,

81
00:10:06,948 --> 00:10:10,659
where stamp collector
Jan Bronski went to work.

82
00:10:10,785 --> 00:10:13,078
Alfred Matzerath
also stayed in Danzig.

83
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:19,960
We Kashubians
have always been here.

84
00:10:21,004 --> 00:10:22,963
Long before the Poles,

85
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:25,466
and, naturally,
long before the Germans.

86
00:10:25,592 --> 00:10:28,177
That's old news, Jan.
Now we've got peace.

87
00:10:28,303 --> 00:10:30,179
Germans, Poles, Kashubians,

88
00:10:30,305 --> 00:10:32,097
we'll all live together in peace.

89
00:10:36,311 --> 00:10:38,061
I don't know.

90
00:10:39,272 --> 00:10:41,023
Well, you'll see.

91
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:51,658
The two men, so different

92
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:54,661
despite their similar feelings
for Mama,

93
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:56,872
liked each other,

94
00:10:56,998 --> 00:10:59,249
and from that trinity

95
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:02,920
they brought me, Oskar,
into the world.

96
00:11:05,673 --> 00:11:08,133
The Sun was in the sign of Virgo.

97
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:13,055
Neptune moved
into the tenth house of middle life,

98
00:11:13,181 --> 00:11:16,975
anchoring Oskar somewhere
between wonder and illusion.

99
00:11:49,425 --> 00:11:50,425
Push!

100
00:11:54,264 --> 00:11:55,889
Push, Agnes, push!

101
00:12:03,773 --> 00:12:05,816
It's coming!

102
00:12:05,942 --> 00:12:08,235
I first saw the light of this world

103
00:12:08,361 --> 00:12:11,488
in the form of a 60-watt bulb.

104
00:12:12,532 --> 00:12:14,366
Alfred!

105
00:12:14,492 --> 00:12:15,909
It's a boy!

106
00:12:25,003 --> 00:12:27,087
I knew it would be a boy,

107
00:12:28,298 --> 00:12:31,091
even if I sometimes said
it would be a girl.

108
00:12:36,014 --> 00:12:37,389
Not so hot.

109
00:12:37,515 --> 00:12:41,476
Crying and impersonating
a meat-coloured baby,

110
00:12:41,603 --> 00:12:45,147
I listened keenly
and with a critical ear

111
00:12:45,273 --> 00:12:47,649
to my parents'
first spontaneous reactions.

112
00:12:47,775 --> 00:12:49,276
He'll take over the business.

113
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:52,738
Now we know
what we're slaving for.

114
00:12:53,615 --> 00:12:56,408
When little Oskar is three years old,

115
00:12:56,534 --> 00:12:58,869
he shall have a tin drum.

116
00:12:58,995 --> 00:13:02,539
Only the prospect of the tin drum

117
00:13:02,665 --> 00:13:05,000
prevented me from expressing

118
00:13:05,126 --> 00:13:09,212
more forcefully
my desire to return to the womb.

119
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:12,883
Besides, my umbilical cord
had been cut.

120
00:13:13,009 --> 00:13:15,385
There was nothing more to be done.

121
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,738
And so it was that I could
hardly wait till my third birthday.

122
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:11,900
Oh, it's little Oskar.

123
00:14:12,026 --> 00:14:14,569
Want some more cake?

124
00:14:14,696 --> 00:14:17,072
Your mouth's filthy.

125
00:14:18,241 --> 00:14:20,325
Another sip, Grandma?

126
00:14:40,513 --> 00:14:42,597
We must learn to respect
our own body.

127
00:14:44,267 --> 00:14:45,642
Alex!

128
00:14:46,436 --> 00:14:50,147
The main thing
is a stable currency.

129
00:14:50,273 --> 00:14:53,024
And plenty to drink!

130
00:14:53,151 --> 00:14:57,070
So here's to the stable mark
and the three-pfennig roll!

131
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,951
To youth!

132
00:15:03,077 --> 00:15:04,619
And beauty!

133
00:15:06,706 --> 00:15:08,415
May I call you Gretchen?

134
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:11,126
Then I'll call her Lina.

135
00:15:12,253 --> 00:15:16,256
We won't be so young
when next we meet!

136
00:16:33,876 --> 00:16:35,502
September 12,

137
00:16:37,004 --> 00:16:39,923
1927.

138
00:16:40,049 --> 00:16:41,758
Next year, you'll be this big,

139
00:16:41,884 --> 00:16:44,553
and then this big,
and then this big,

140
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:46,054
and then as big as me.

141
00:16:48,766 --> 00:16:50,141
Fresh from the cellar.

142
00:16:50,268 --> 00:16:52,018
Here are the glasses.

143
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:02,654
Playing, Mr. Scheffler?

144
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,616
Go ahead. I'll just watch.

145
00:17:07,535 --> 00:17:09,119
Besides, it's my bedtime.

146
00:17:09,245 --> 00:17:10,412
He's always tired.

147
00:17:10,538 --> 00:17:13,248
You shouldn't have married a baker.

148
00:17:26,888 --> 00:17:31,683
It's been a long time since Grandma
let anyone under her skirts.

149
00:17:34,562 --> 00:17:36,730
I don't understand this game.

150
00:17:39,066 --> 00:17:40,984
Let's see where the jacks are.

151
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,835
Hey, cousin, you're out of diamonds!

152
00:17:59,629 --> 00:18:02,339
Don't argue. Play.

153
00:18:10,014 --> 00:18:11,890
I have two diamonds myself.

154
00:18:12,016 --> 00:18:13,475
How would I know?

155
00:18:17,521 --> 00:18:19,230
That day,

156
00:18:19,357 --> 00:18:21,775
reflecting on the grown-up world

157
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:25,904
and my own future,

158
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:28,573
I decided to call a halt,

159
00:18:28,699 --> 00:18:32,577
to stop growing then and there

160
00:18:32,703 --> 00:18:35,038
and remain a three-year-old,

161
00:18:35,164 --> 00:18:37,499
a gnome, once and for all!

162
00:19:15,705 --> 00:19:17,789
One, two, three...

163
00:20:15,389 --> 00:20:17,599
My God, there he is.

164
00:20:20,853 --> 00:20:22,729
He fell down the stairs!

165
00:20:28,486 --> 00:20:30,487
Why was the cellar door open?

166
00:20:31,572 --> 00:20:34,949
Alfred, it's your fault!
You left the cellar door open!

167
00:20:35,076 --> 00:20:37,994
I was just getting beer for everyone!

168
00:20:43,667 --> 00:20:45,794
Run and get the doctor.

169
00:20:49,215 --> 00:20:50,840
You! It's your fault!

170
00:20:50,966 --> 00:20:53,968
You left the cellar door open!

171
00:20:54,095 --> 00:20:55,595
Stop!

172
00:21:05,606 --> 00:21:06,898
Calm down!

173
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:11,861
My little Oskar...

174
00:21:15,116 --> 00:21:17,283
How could this have happened?

175
00:21:25,668 --> 00:21:29,963
Two weeks in bed
and Oskar will be as good as new.

176
00:21:33,092 --> 00:21:36,094
Just a slight concussion.

177
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:37,804
Plenty of compresses.

178
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:41,182
My fall was a complete success.

179
00:21:41,934 --> 00:21:43,268
The family story was:

180
00:21:43,394 --> 00:21:45,520
On his third birthday,

181
00:21:45,646 --> 00:21:48,857
our little Oskar
fell down the cellar stairs.

182
00:21:48,983 --> 00:21:50,817
He didn't break any bones,

183
00:21:50,943 --> 00:21:52,902
but he never grew again after that,

184
00:21:53,028 --> 00:21:55,154
not a fraction of an inch.

185
00:21:57,616 --> 00:22:00,660
That drum again.

186
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:10,461
There's my little Oskar,
all well again.

187
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:13,172
Morning!

188
00:22:40,868 --> 00:22:43,953
It's Poland's very first stamp,

189
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:45,788
over 100 years old.

190
00:22:45,915 --> 00:22:48,166
Lunch time!

191
00:22:50,544 --> 00:22:52,921
I have to go.

192
00:22:54,632 --> 00:22:57,383
Stay, he's cooked mushrooms.

193
00:22:57,509 --> 00:23:00,678
I'm on duty at the post office.

194
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:04,182
Not in the house, I said.

195
00:23:04,308 --> 00:23:06,559
Besides, it's broken.
You'll hurt yourself.

196
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:08,102
You staying for lunch?

197
00:23:08,228 --> 00:23:09,354
Post office time.

198
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,064
Let me have that.

199
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:13,524
If you hurt yourself,
it will be my fault again.

200
00:23:15,194 --> 00:23:17,403
See? I told you so.

201
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:23,701
Give me that drum
and I'll give you some chocolate.

202
00:23:24,912 --> 00:23:27,956
Let them have it.
I'll get you a new one.

203
00:23:28,082 --> 00:23:29,916
No! Oskar don't want!

204
00:23:30,042 --> 00:23:31,459
We'll see about that.

205
00:23:32,086 --> 00:23:34,045
Alfred, why must you always
use force?

206
00:23:35,005 --> 00:23:36,589
My drum!

207
00:23:53,232 --> 00:23:56,567
And thus I discovered
that my voice

208
00:23:56,694 --> 00:24:02,365
was capable of a scream
so high-pitched

209
00:24:02,491 --> 00:24:07,203
that no one dared
take my drum away.

210
00:24:08,455 --> 00:24:10,331
Shards bring luck.

211
00:24:10,457 --> 00:24:13,793
Because when my drum
was taken away,

212
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,294
I screamed,

213
00:24:15,421 --> 00:24:17,255
and when I screamed,

214
00:24:17,381 --> 00:24:20,299
valuable articles burst into bits.

215
00:24:50,998 --> 00:24:54,625
Is the black witch here today?

216
00:24:54,752 --> 00:24:57,045
No, no, no!

217
00:24:57,171 --> 00:24:59,964
She will make an evil brew

218
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:03,384
She will put you in her stew

219
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:06,304
And then she will devour you

220
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:08,973
Look, there she is!

221
00:25:17,024 --> 00:25:18,775
Things'll change around here!

222
00:25:18,901 --> 00:25:21,235
Beat it, damn kids!
I'm coming down!

223
00:25:52,059 --> 00:25:56,395
O glorious call of the sun...

224
00:26:18,544 --> 00:26:19,919
I'll take that one.

225
00:26:23,549 --> 00:26:27,802
Look, if you please,
at this extraordinary potato.

226
00:26:27,928 --> 00:26:31,305
This tumescent, luxuriant flesh,

227
00:26:31,431 --> 00:26:35,393
forever conceiving new shapes...

228
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:38,062
and yet so chaste.

229
00:26:39,064 --> 00:26:40,439
I love the potato

230
00:26:40,566 --> 00:26:42,942
because it speaks to me.

231
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:47,363
Yes, spuds are bigger this year
than last.

232
00:26:48,282 --> 00:26:49,699
What are you doing?

233
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,536
Oskar learn to write.

234
00:26:53,662 --> 00:26:58,541
Forget it.
You'll never learn to read and write.

235
00:26:58,667 --> 00:27:00,626
The great classics,

236
00:27:00,752 --> 00:27:02,879
the eternal truths,

237
00:27:03,005 --> 00:27:04,797
die unto life!

238
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:25,276
Hold it.
Now I've got all of you.

239
00:27:27,237 --> 00:27:31,073
For you on your first day of school.

240
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,825
Eyes this way, please.

241
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:46,881
My name is Spollenhauer,
and I am your teacher.

242
00:27:48,884 --> 00:27:52,303
And now, dear children,
do any of you know a song?

243
00:27:56,058 --> 00:27:58,100
You must be little Oskar.

244
00:27:58,227 --> 00:28:00,311
We've heard so much about you.

245
00:28:00,437 --> 00:28:02,188
You play that so well.

246
00:28:02,314 --> 00:28:05,191
Isn't our Oskar a fine drummer?

247
00:28:07,653 --> 00:28:10,529
But now let's put the drum away.

248
00:28:10,656 --> 00:28:13,282
It must be sleepy.

249
00:28:14,576 --> 00:28:17,828
After school,
you can have it back again.

250
00:28:22,501 --> 00:28:24,418
You're a naughty Oskar.

251
00:28:27,714 --> 00:28:30,675
I will now read you the schedule.

252
00:28:30,801 --> 00:28:35,012
Monday: Writing,
arithmetic, reading,

253
00:28:35,138 --> 00:28:36,931
religion.

254
00:28:37,057 --> 00:28:39,850
All together: Writing,

255
00:28:40,978 --> 00:28:42,395
arithmetic.

256
00:28:43,563 --> 00:28:45,314
Oskar, stop that!

257
00:28:46,233 --> 00:28:48,901
Religion.

258
00:28:57,327 --> 00:28:59,620
- Miss Spollenhauer.
- Oskar!

259
00:29:09,715 --> 00:29:12,425
- Miss... Miss Spollenhauer...
- Get out!

260
00:29:17,347 --> 00:29:19,098
Strange.

261
00:29:19,224 --> 00:29:20,975
Very strange.

262
00:29:21,101 --> 00:29:23,477
How old is he, did you say?

263
00:29:23,603 --> 00:29:25,062
Six, Doctor.

264
00:29:25,188 --> 00:29:28,065
Inge, kindly undress Oskar.

265
00:29:28,191 --> 00:29:31,819
How long is it
since he fell down the stairs?

266
00:29:31,945 --> 00:29:34,488
Three years on September 12.

267
00:29:34,614 --> 00:29:36,991
We'd better examine his spine again.

268
00:29:37,117 --> 00:29:38,951
Be a good boy.

269
00:29:39,077 --> 00:29:41,037
I'll give it right back.

270
00:29:41,913 --> 00:29:44,332
Oskar, give me your drum.
I'll hold it.

271
00:29:44,458 --> 00:29:47,793
See, you can't get out of your shirt.

272
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:49,795
Oskar, if you're not good,

273
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:52,298
the doctor won't make you well.

274
00:29:52,424 --> 00:29:56,218
Come, child. Give me the drum.

275
00:30:25,207 --> 00:30:26,791
Amazing.

276
00:30:33,924 --> 00:30:35,758
I shall write a paper

277
00:30:35,884 --> 00:30:40,054
about this
for one of our medical journals,

278
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:42,348
if you have no objection.

279
00:30:45,394 --> 00:30:46,727
Amazing.

280
00:30:56,071 --> 00:31:00,282
"The destructive force
of this local phenomenon

281
00:31:00,409 --> 00:31:03,661
"is such as to suggest

282
00:31:03,787 --> 00:31:08,707
"an anomalous formation
of the lower larynx

283
00:31:08,834 --> 00:31:12,628
"in little Oskar Matzerath.

284
00:31:13,505 --> 00:31:18,300
"Nor can we exclude the hypothesis

285
00:31:18,427 --> 00:31:22,513
"of a concomitant development
of the vocal cords."

286
00:31:22,639 --> 00:31:25,766
Did you hear that?
In a medical journal.

287
00:31:25,892 --> 00:31:28,519
Does the doctor say
why he won't grow?

288
00:31:29,563 --> 00:31:31,605
You'll have to ask him that.

289
00:31:32,691 --> 00:31:34,191
Why he won't grow!

290
00:31:34,317 --> 00:31:36,110
Cut it out.

291
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:38,529
He's yours as much as mine.

292
00:31:39,322 --> 00:31:40,698
If not more.

293
00:31:40,824 --> 00:31:43,159
Who left the cellar door open,
you or me?

294
00:31:47,664 --> 00:31:51,167
A, B, C, D, E,

295
00:31:51,293 --> 00:31:54,086
I'm a little headachy.

296
00:31:54,212 --> 00:31:57,214
F, G, H, I, J, K,

297
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:59,884
what will the doctor say?

298
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:02,803
L, M, N, O,

299
00:32:02,929 --> 00:32:05,306
I'm ready to go.

300
00:32:07,309 --> 00:32:10,144
P, Q, R, S, T,

301
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:12,521
feeling quite feisty.

302
00:32:13,607 --> 00:32:16,400
U, V, W, X,

303
00:32:16,526 --> 00:32:18,611
troubles will be axed.

304
00:32:19,571 --> 00:32:21,447
Y and Z,

305
00:32:21,573 --> 00:32:24,074
I'm off to bed!

306
00:32:26,286 --> 00:32:29,163
You're not listening, Oskar!

307
00:32:30,749 --> 00:32:32,958
Again.

308
00:32:33,793 --> 00:32:36,837
A, B, C, D, E,

309
00:32:36,963 --> 00:32:39,632
I'm a little headachy.

310
00:32:39,758 --> 00:32:42,760
F, G, H, I, J, K,

311
00:32:42,886 --> 00:32:44,178
what will...

312
00:32:45,889 --> 00:32:48,015
Oskar read!

313
00:32:48,141 --> 00:32:49,767
This isn't for you.

314
00:32:50,685 --> 00:32:51,685
Rasputin...

315
00:32:51,811 --> 00:32:54,772
Rashu, Rashu, Rapupin.

316
00:32:54,898 --> 00:32:56,357
O-skar.

317
00:32:57,025 --> 00:32:58,400
No:

318
00:32:58,527 --> 00:33:00,194
O-rgy.

319
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,655
Orgy! Oskar read!

320
00:33:21,049 --> 00:33:24,468
"All within me, said Rasputin,

321
00:33:24,594 --> 00:33:27,012
"is pure light

322
00:33:27,138 --> 00:33:29,598
"which will cleanse your sins.

323
00:33:29,724 --> 00:33:31,308
"Not surprisingly,

324
00:33:31,434 --> 00:33:35,062
"the ladies of the Court
flung themselves at the prophet."

325
00:33:36,231 --> 00:33:39,233
- Rasputin was...
- Is he making progress?

326
00:33:43,488 --> 00:33:45,364
What? You're reading Rasputin?

327
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:50,744
No danger he'll understand?

328
00:33:54,666 --> 00:33:58,210
I'm trying hard
but he learns nothing.

329
00:33:59,504 --> 00:34:01,088
Where are you up to?

330
00:34:02,424 --> 00:34:05,801
"The Gorokhova Street drawing room...

331
00:34:07,804 --> 00:34:12,349
"Rasputin was alone
with Irina and the Grand Duchess,

332
00:34:12,475 --> 00:34:14,602
"who smiled faintly.

333
00:34:14,728 --> 00:34:17,855
"A holy man is in our midst,
she whispered,

334
00:34:17,981 --> 00:34:22,651
"staring dreamily..."

335
00:34:24,195 --> 00:34:27,448
"They were drawn
into loving caresses.

336
00:34:30,577 --> 00:34:34,705
"He ignited their kisses.

337
00:34:35,832 --> 00:34:40,794
"The prophet's burning eyes
bewitched them all.

338
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:44,882
"Soon they collapsed
upon his chest."

339
00:34:46,092 --> 00:34:47,801
Have mercy!

340
00:34:50,513 --> 00:34:53,849
"His black beard grazed her breasts.

341
00:34:55,226 --> 00:34:59,647
"Voluptuous bodies
sprawled over the holy man..."

342
00:35:04,527 --> 00:35:06,695
You might wonder:

343
00:35:06,821 --> 00:35:09,531
To what shoddy background

344
00:35:09,658 --> 00:35:13,243
did this young man owe
his upbringing?

345
00:35:14,162 --> 00:35:17,748
But while my poor mama
and Gretchen Scheffler

346
00:35:17,874 --> 00:35:19,833
couldn't get enough of Rasputin,

347
00:35:19,959 --> 00:35:24,546
I discovered
Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.

348
00:35:24,673 --> 00:35:26,632
Elective Affinities.

349
00:35:27,717 --> 00:35:32,596
And thus I grew,
not in size but in spirit,

350
00:35:32,722 --> 00:35:36,350
torn between Rasputin and Goethe

351
00:35:36,476 --> 00:35:40,145
to the point of merging
the two books,

352
00:35:40,271 --> 00:35:45,734
following demonic passages
with more enlightened ones,

353
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:47,653
just like in real life.

354
00:36:02,961 --> 00:36:06,422
Uncle Heilandt,
come spit in the soup.

355
00:36:06,548 --> 00:36:09,216
Look what I found in the pond!

356
00:36:09,342 --> 00:36:10,843
Two frogs!

357
00:36:30,864 --> 00:36:33,741
They're still alive!

358
00:36:38,371 --> 00:36:40,622
Make Oskar taste the soup!

359
00:37:07,734 --> 00:37:09,401
Now it's your turn.

360
00:37:09,527 --> 00:37:11,487
You'll love it.

361
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:15,115
Open your mouth.

362
00:37:20,163 --> 00:37:21,872
Good, huh?

363
00:37:57,742 --> 00:38:01,745
My street and its backyards
hemmed me in.

364
00:38:01,871 --> 00:38:04,373
I longed for space

365
00:38:04,499 --> 00:38:06,750
and took every opportunity

366
00:38:06,876 --> 00:38:09,711
to escape the persecution
by the soup cooks

367
00:38:09,838 --> 00:38:13,006
by going into town

368
00:38:13,132 --> 00:38:16,051
alone or with Mama.

369
00:39:14,903 --> 00:39:17,404
Your drum's busted?

370
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:19,823
Want me to mend it?

371
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:23,327
No, he's getting a new one.

372
00:39:25,622 --> 00:39:27,122
My respects.

373
00:39:34,422 --> 00:39:35,964
Hello, Uncle Jan.

374
00:40:02,116 --> 00:40:03,617
I must leave you now.

375
00:40:04,786 --> 00:40:06,870
I have a few errands to run.

376
00:40:10,416 --> 00:40:13,126
This is for your drum, Oskar.

377
00:40:13,252 --> 00:40:14,336
Is it enough?

378
00:40:31,104 --> 00:40:33,021
Good day, Mr. Markus.

379
00:40:33,147 --> 00:40:35,023
Who do we have here?
Mrs. Matzerath.

380
00:40:35,149 --> 00:40:38,193
And little Oskar.
Here for a new drum?

381
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:40,445
Yes, Mr. Markus. Again.

382
00:40:40,571 --> 00:40:42,364
He's always at it.

383
00:40:42,490 --> 00:40:45,742
I never know
what day of the week it is,

384
00:40:45,868 --> 00:40:48,453
except when you come in.

385
00:40:48,579 --> 00:40:51,748
Then something tells me
it must be Thursday again.

386
00:40:52,917 --> 00:40:55,377
You have such beautiful hands.

387
00:40:55,503 --> 00:40:58,088
Worth their weight in gold.

388
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:02,509
See that box? Hand it to me.

389
00:41:05,263 --> 00:41:09,224
Look here, Mrs. Agnes.
Beautiful silk stockings.

390
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:10,684
Pure silk.

391
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:12,602
Fine quality.

392
00:41:13,271 --> 00:41:16,356
One, two, three pairs for you.

393
00:41:16,482 --> 00:41:18,775
They'll suit you fine,
it's a bargain.

394
00:41:18,901 --> 00:41:20,694
Much too expensive for me.

395
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:22,571
They're worth it.

396
00:41:22,697 --> 00:41:23,780
Maybe another time.

397
00:41:23,906 --> 00:41:27,075
I'll let them go for half a gulden.

398
00:41:27,869 --> 00:41:29,077
That cheap?

399
00:41:30,371 --> 00:41:32,664
No, Markus,
that's giving them away.

400
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:35,584
Take them,
and don't ask questions.

401
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:37,461
And now, Oskar,

402
00:41:37,587 --> 00:41:40,422
what can I do for the little prince?

403
00:41:41,716 --> 00:41:43,508
Oh, is it a new drum we need?

404
00:41:44,093 --> 00:41:47,721
Just choose one.
You know where they are!

405
00:41:48,556 --> 00:41:49,806
See, Oskar?

406
00:41:50,558 --> 00:41:52,017
He's so happy.

407
00:41:54,437 --> 00:41:57,355
Mr. Markus, could little Oskar

408
00:41:57,482 --> 00:41:59,649
stay with you for half an hour?

409
00:42:01,277 --> 00:42:03,487
I have some important errands.

410
00:42:03,613 --> 00:42:06,448
I'll watch him
like the apple of my eye.

411
00:42:06,574 --> 00:42:09,993
See to your important errands,
and don't worry.

412
00:42:10,119 --> 00:42:12,412
The little prince will stay with me

413
00:42:13,498 --> 00:42:16,541
while you take care
of your important errands,

414
00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:19,002
just like every Thursday.

415
00:47:28,396 --> 00:47:29,979
We're closing off the street!

416
00:47:56,048 --> 00:48:00,009
Danzig is
and always has been German.

417
00:48:01,804 --> 00:48:04,556
The Corridor is
and always has been German.

418
00:48:05,724 --> 00:48:08,059
All these territories owe

419
00:48:09,562 --> 00:48:12,439
their cultural development

420
00:48:12,565 --> 00:48:14,858
exclusively to the German people.

421
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:18,111
If not for the German people,

422
00:48:19,029 --> 00:48:22,532
these eastern territories
would have succumbed to barbarism.

423
00:48:34,879 --> 00:48:36,838
Have a nice stroll?

424
00:48:45,514 --> 00:48:48,892
Everyone can hear the Führer
but us!

425
00:49:06,952 --> 00:49:07,994
What's wrong with you?

426
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:10,955
I suffer from an illness.

427
00:49:11,081 --> 00:49:12,832
What is it?

428
00:49:13,709 --> 00:49:16,961
I've gone bird-brained!

429
00:49:36,398 --> 00:49:38,399
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

430
00:49:38,526 --> 00:49:40,860
the smallest of the small:

431
00:49:40,986 --> 00:49:43,863
Bebra and his midgets!

432
00:51:51,867 --> 00:51:53,284
My word!

433
00:51:55,037 --> 00:51:58,331
Now it's three-year-olds
who choose to stop growing.

434
00:52:00,626 --> 00:52:02,460
My name is Bebra.

435
00:52:05,130 --> 00:52:09,050
Directly descended
from Prince Eugene...

436
00:52:10,594 --> 00:52:14,931
whose father was Louis XIV,

437
00:52:15,057 --> 00:52:17,934
and not some Savoyard,
as has been claimed.

438
00:52:19,353 --> 00:52:22,063
On my tenth birthday,

439
00:52:22,189 --> 00:52:24,190
I stopped my growth.

440
00:52:25,734 --> 00:52:27,026
Better late

441
00:52:27,653 --> 00:52:29,112
than never.

442
00:52:32,950 --> 00:52:34,450
Tell me, my dear Oskar,

443
00:52:34,576 --> 00:52:37,036
you must be 14 or 15 now.

444
00:52:37,162 --> 00:52:38,788
Twelve and a half.

445
00:52:38,914 --> 00:52:40,415
No!

446
00:52:40,541 --> 00:52:42,333
And how old do you think I am?

447
00:52:44,628 --> 00:52:46,546
Thirty-five.

448
00:52:47,673 --> 00:52:50,007
Flatterer!

449
00:52:50,134 --> 00:52:52,844
I was 35 once.

450
00:52:52,970 --> 00:52:57,181
I shall be 53 in August.

451
00:52:57,307 --> 00:52:59,100
I could be your grandfather.

452
00:53:00,227 --> 00:53:04,522
- Are you an artist too?
- Not really. Although...

453
00:53:15,534 --> 00:53:18,786
...as you see, I can lay claim
to a certain artistry.

454
00:53:24,710 --> 00:53:27,462
You must join us. You must!

455
00:53:28,714 --> 00:53:30,298
You know, Mr. Bebra...

456
00:53:35,596 --> 00:53:37,346
...to tell the truth,

457
00:53:37,473 --> 00:53:40,725
I prefer to be
a member of the audience

458
00:53:40,851 --> 00:53:44,270
and let my little art
flower in secret.

459
00:53:45,189 --> 00:53:46,773
My dear Oskar,

460
00:53:47,858 --> 00:53:50,943
trust an experienced colleague.

461
00:53:51,069 --> 00:53:54,322
Our kind must never sit
in the audience.

462
00:53:54,448 --> 00:53:56,532
Our kind must perform

463
00:53:56,658 --> 00:53:57,950
and run the show,

464
00:53:58,076 --> 00:54:00,077
or it's the others that will run us.

465
00:54:02,247 --> 00:54:04,499
And the others are coming.

466
00:54:04,625 --> 00:54:06,793
They will take over the fairgrounds.

467
00:54:06,919 --> 00:54:10,546
They will stage torchlight parades.
They will build platforms

468
00:54:10,672 --> 00:54:12,256
and fill them,

469
00:54:12,382 --> 00:54:16,093
and from those platforms
preach our destruction.

470
00:54:22,142 --> 00:54:25,978
They're looking for you, dear friend.
But we will meet again.

471
00:54:26,104 --> 00:54:29,065
We're too little
to lose each other.

472
00:54:59,221 --> 00:55:00,972
They are coming!

473
00:55:31,461 --> 00:55:33,087
A radio!

474
00:56:00,198 --> 00:56:01,616
Thank you, Uncle Jan.

475
00:56:05,329 --> 00:56:07,580
These damn leggings
keep falling down!

476
00:56:07,706 --> 00:56:10,207
- Good morning, cousin.
- Good morning, Alfred.

477
00:56:10,334 --> 00:56:12,001
I need boots.

478
00:56:12,127 --> 00:56:13,794
You know they cost way too much.

479
00:56:13,921 --> 00:56:15,796
Or leather gaiters at least.

480
00:56:17,049 --> 00:56:18,674
How do I look?

481
00:56:20,552 --> 00:56:22,053
Going to the demonstration?

482
00:56:22,679 --> 00:56:24,180
At the fairground.

483
00:56:24,973 --> 00:56:26,682
A mass rally.

484
00:56:31,396 --> 00:56:34,065
Gauleiter Löbsack is speaking.

485
00:56:35,025 --> 00:56:36,692
And what a speaker he is.

486
00:56:37,819 --> 00:56:42,281
I tell you,
these are historic days.

487
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:46,035
A man can't stand aside.
Gotta join in.

488
00:56:49,247 --> 00:56:52,041
You should read the Danzig Sentinel.

489
00:56:53,001 --> 00:56:55,711
Your siding with Poland is crazy.

490
00:56:55,837 --> 00:56:57,838
I've told you a thousand times.

491
00:56:58,882 --> 00:57:00,800
I am a Pole.

492
00:57:00,926 --> 00:57:02,468
Think it over.

493
00:57:03,387 --> 00:57:05,262
Take your umbrella.
It looks like rain.

494
00:57:05,389 --> 00:57:08,557
An umbrella?
With this uniform?

495
00:57:10,310 --> 00:57:13,521
The stew is on.
Stir it now and then.

496
00:57:13,647 --> 00:57:15,147
It'll be done in 20 minutes.

497
00:57:15,273 --> 00:57:17,900
- Want a bite to eat before you go?
- No time.

498
00:57:18,026 --> 00:57:21,320
Duty is duty,
and schnapps is schnapps.

499
00:58:02,529 --> 00:58:03,821
Blue!

500
00:58:07,409 --> 00:58:09,160
Blue eyes!

501
00:58:10,037 --> 00:58:11,495
Oskar too.

502
00:58:12,789 --> 00:58:14,749
The Bronski family blue eyes!

503
00:58:15,625 --> 00:58:17,376
We share them, both of us...

504
00:58:20,505 --> 00:58:22,423
Jan, stop!

505
00:58:26,136 --> 00:58:27,762
I can no longer bear

506
00:58:28,930 --> 00:58:31,932
that he doesn't know.

507
00:58:40,484 --> 00:58:45,529
My dear fellow countrymen
and countrywomen

508
00:58:45,655 --> 00:58:49,867
from Danzig and Langfuhr,

509
00:58:49,993 --> 00:58:53,996
from Ohra, Schiedlitz and Praust,

510
00:58:54,873 --> 00:58:59,251
from the hills and from the lowlands,

511
00:58:59,377 --> 00:59:02,129
I know that you all

512
00:59:03,048 --> 00:59:07,551
cherish but one wish.

513
00:59:07,677 --> 00:59:10,221
It has been our heartfelt wish

514
00:59:11,681 --> 00:59:14,934
ever since the shameful
Versailles Diktat

515
00:59:15,060 --> 00:59:19,563
separated us from our beloved
German fatherland.

516
00:59:20,357 --> 00:59:24,735
And that wish is
to go home to the Reich!

517
00:59:34,579 --> 00:59:38,791
What is the meaning
of this Free State

518
00:59:39,835 --> 00:59:42,753
that was so generously
foisted on us?

519
00:59:45,132 --> 00:59:48,843
It means that our waterfront

520
00:59:48,969 --> 00:59:51,345
is crawling with Polacks.

521
00:59:51,471 --> 00:59:54,431
And in the middle
of our beloved Old City,

522
00:59:54,558 --> 00:59:58,227
they've stuck a Polish post office,

523
00:59:58,353 --> 01:00:00,604
a present we can do without!

524
01:00:06,403 --> 01:00:08,529
We Germans

525
01:00:08,655 --> 01:00:10,698
had post offices

526
01:00:10,824 --> 01:00:16,120
before the Poles even thought
of writing letters!

527
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:19,456
We taught them the alphabet!

528
01:00:21,668 --> 01:00:24,962
And now, dear party comrades,

529
01:00:25,088 --> 01:00:27,631
let us welcome
our guest from the Reich

530
01:00:27,757 --> 01:00:30,843
whom the Führer sent to greet us.

531
01:00:31,928 --> 01:00:38,434
Party comrade Albert Forster
has just arrived on the field!

532
01:05:39,694 --> 01:05:43,197
Hey, can you catch them
with a clothesline?

533
01:05:44,866 --> 01:05:46,283
Sure you can.

534
01:05:46,409 --> 01:05:49,077
Real fish, orjust old shoes?

535
01:05:49,204 --> 01:05:52,372
Suppose we take a look.

536
01:05:53,416 --> 01:05:55,250
Maybe something's there.

537
01:06:14,229 --> 01:06:16,188
Get the sack.

538
01:06:49,138 --> 01:06:51,473
You think they're fat?

539
01:06:53,059 --> 01:06:54,726
You should have seen them

540
01:06:54,852 --> 01:06:58,188
after the battle of Jutland,

541
01:06:59,148 --> 01:07:03,068
when we and the English...
See what I mean?

542
01:07:03,820 --> 01:07:06,154
"Proudly flies the Banner

543
01:07:06,281 --> 01:07:08,073
"Black-White-Red..."

544
01:07:08,199 --> 01:07:09,533
Get it?

545
01:07:10,243 --> 01:07:12,160
After the battle...

546
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,585
they were this thick, the eels.

547
01:07:31,806 --> 01:07:34,266
He wanted 1.50,

548
01:07:34,392 --> 01:07:36,393
but I gave him a gulden.

549
01:08:13,848 --> 01:08:17,100
Don't expect me
to touch your eels.

550
01:08:17,226 --> 01:08:19,436
Don't put on airs.

551
01:08:19,562 --> 01:08:22,397
I'll never eat fish again.
Certainly not eels.

552
01:08:22,523 --> 01:08:26,610
You've always eaten them
and you knew where they came from.

553
01:08:27,820 --> 01:08:29,029
Quiet!

554
01:08:29,864 --> 01:08:32,115
Stop that drumming
once and for all!

555
01:08:32,241 --> 01:08:33,367
Leave the child alone!

556
01:08:33,493 --> 01:08:34,785
And sit down!

557
01:08:34,911 --> 01:08:38,038
Who was to blame?
Who left the cellar door open?

558
01:08:38,164 --> 01:08:39,748
That's old news.

559
01:08:41,501 --> 01:08:44,586
See if they're not delicious.

560
01:08:44,712 --> 01:08:47,255
Come on. Dig in.

561
01:08:47,382 --> 01:08:50,509
Fresh eel with dill sauce,

562
01:08:51,344 --> 01:08:54,846
bay leaf
and a twist of lemon peel.

563
01:08:54,972 --> 01:08:57,683
Don't make her eat
if she doesn't want to.

564
01:08:57,809 --> 01:08:58,934
Keep out of this.

565
01:08:59,060 --> 01:09:02,187
Leave her alone.
She'll only vomit.

566
01:09:02,313 --> 01:09:04,439
I paid good money for these eels.

567
01:09:04,565 --> 01:09:07,067
Just try them.

568
01:09:07,193 --> 01:09:11,530
They've been well cleaned
and washed.

569
01:09:14,283 --> 01:09:17,619
No gall. Light, healthy liver.

570
01:09:17,745 --> 01:09:19,454
And so fresh!

571
01:09:24,502 --> 01:09:26,378
Oskar, sit down.

572
01:09:28,965 --> 01:09:30,841
I slaved over the stove for hours.

573
01:09:30,967 --> 01:09:33,885
Some people would be
very happy to eat my eels.

574
01:10:03,166 --> 01:10:04,833
I don't know what to do!

575
01:10:04,959 --> 01:10:06,877
Alfred, calm down.

576
01:10:07,003 --> 01:10:10,130
I can't talk to her.
And the fish is getting cold.

577
01:10:10,256 --> 01:10:12,090
Women are more sensitive.

578
01:10:12,842 --> 01:10:16,845
You talk to her.
If only she'd calm down.

579
01:12:17,174 --> 01:12:19,676
Shouldn't I warm them up at least?

580
01:12:55,129 --> 01:12:57,172
Don't do it with Bronski.

581
01:12:58,507 --> 01:13:01,760
He joined the wrong side when
he went with the Polish post office.

582
01:13:01,886 --> 01:13:04,054
Don't bet on the Poles.

583
01:13:04,180 --> 01:13:07,265
If you must bet, bet on the Germans.

584
01:13:07,391 --> 01:13:09,643
Sooner or later, they'll take over.

585
01:13:10,728 --> 01:13:13,980
Imagine when the Germans come
and you're stuck with Bronski,

586
01:13:14,106 --> 01:13:15,565
that meshugge Pole.

587
01:13:15,691 --> 01:13:19,027
You'll be in trouble then.

588
01:13:19,153 --> 01:13:22,405
Why not bet on Matzerath?

589
01:13:28,037 --> 01:13:33,291
Or, if you'd do me the great honour,
bet on me,

590
01:13:34,627 --> 01:13:36,294
Sigismund Markus,

591
01:13:36,420 --> 01:13:38,463
who was just baptized.

592
01:13:38,589 --> 01:13:40,590
No, Markus. Please!

593
01:13:40,716 --> 01:13:42,384
We could go to London

594
01:13:42,510 --> 01:13:45,679
like everybody else,
before the Germans come.

595
01:13:50,685 --> 01:13:52,310
Look. There he is.

596
01:13:53,229 --> 01:13:55,689
We'll take him with us to London.

597
01:13:55,815 --> 01:13:57,774
He'll live like a prince.

598
01:13:59,986 --> 01:14:02,862
Thank you, Markus,
but it's impossible,

599
01:14:02,989 --> 01:14:05,115
and not because of Bronski.

600
01:14:05,241 --> 01:14:08,702
I'm glad to hear that. I had a feeling
it wasn't because of him.

601
01:14:08,828 --> 01:14:10,912
Steer clear of Bronski,

602
01:14:11,038 --> 01:14:12,747
and stick to Matzerath.

603
01:15:29,533 --> 01:15:30,533
Come on.

604
01:15:32,536 --> 01:15:33,703
Play.

605
01:15:34,497 --> 01:15:35,789
One two, one two...

606
01:15:39,502 --> 01:15:41,211
You can't

607
01:15:41,337 --> 01:15:42,670
or you won't?

608
01:15:43,547 --> 01:15:45,006
Rascal!

609
01:15:45,132 --> 01:15:46,633
'Cause you can do everything else.

610
01:15:47,384 --> 01:15:51,221
I have sinned
in thought, word and deed.

611
01:15:51,347 --> 01:15:53,306
Alone or with others?

612
01:15:53,432 --> 01:15:54,891
With someone else.

613
01:15:55,017 --> 01:15:56,476
When and where?

614
01:15:57,269 --> 01:15:59,604
Thursdays, on the Tischlergasse.

615
01:15:59,730 --> 01:16:02,982
But, child,
that same filthy neighbourhood?

616
01:16:03,109 --> 01:16:04,734
I can't help it, Father.

617
01:16:04,860 --> 01:16:07,403
I try, but I can't.

618
01:16:07,530 --> 01:16:10,907
But the consequences,
my dear Mrs. Matzerath?

619
01:16:12,284 --> 01:16:13,952
They're already here, Father.

620
01:16:14,995 --> 01:16:16,621
They're already here.

621
01:16:25,381 --> 01:16:27,257
What do you think you're doing?

622
01:16:27,383 --> 01:16:28,550
Little brat.

623
01:16:38,102 --> 01:16:41,020
Father, what will I do
with the child?

624
01:16:42,356 --> 01:16:45,525
I love my little Oskar,

625
01:16:45,651 --> 01:16:48,570
but he's already 14.

626
01:16:48,696 --> 01:16:51,739
He's always in trouble,
and now this!

627
01:16:53,284 --> 01:16:56,578
Pray, Mrs. Matzerath, pray.

628
01:16:58,706 --> 01:17:00,832
Oskar, stop it.

629
01:17:06,547 --> 01:17:07,589
Agnes?

630
01:18:52,903 --> 01:18:56,030
What did I tell you?
Fish again.

631
01:18:57,116 --> 01:18:58,950
She doesn't eat.
She gulps it down.

632
01:18:59,076 --> 01:19:01,160
And she's surprised
it doesn't stay down.

633
01:19:01,287 --> 01:19:02,870
God, how can this be?

634
01:19:04,081 --> 01:19:06,207
This has been going on
for three weeks.

635
01:19:06,333 --> 01:19:08,584
First it was kippers and sardines.

636
01:19:08,711 --> 01:19:11,004
Now it's pickled herring.

637
01:19:12,881 --> 01:19:14,882
I've tried everything.

638
01:19:15,009 --> 01:19:16,676
I'm at the end of my rope.

639
01:19:17,636 --> 01:19:19,387
Why didn't you call me sooner?

640
01:19:34,486 --> 01:19:36,404
Agnes, tell me what's wrong.

641
01:19:40,617 --> 01:19:42,577
You know
fish doesn't agree with you!

642
01:19:43,704 --> 01:19:45,246
Take it from me.

643
01:19:45,372 --> 01:19:50,585
The Führer prefers
a single communist joining the party

644
01:19:50,711 --> 01:19:53,087
to one bourgeois bureaucrat...

645
01:19:59,345 --> 01:20:00,470
Doesn't want to live,

646
01:20:00,596 --> 01:20:02,055
doesn't want to die.

647
01:20:02,890 --> 01:20:04,891
I don't know.

648
01:20:06,643 --> 01:20:10,313
It's too much of everything,
and it keeps piling up.

649
01:20:12,941 --> 01:20:16,694
I used to say that too,
but I made it.

650
01:20:18,489 --> 01:20:20,156
Think it was easy

651
01:20:20,282 --> 01:20:23,326
when Koljaiczek, your father,

652
01:20:24,578 --> 01:20:26,621
disappeared under the timber

653
01:20:28,332 --> 01:20:30,208
and never came back?

654
01:20:30,334 --> 01:20:32,126
But at least he was gone!

655
01:20:32,252 --> 01:20:34,462
The man was gone, you say!

656
01:20:34,588 --> 01:20:36,839
How can you talk like that

657
01:20:36,965 --> 01:20:39,592
when you do it with two
and never get enough?

658
01:20:39,718 --> 01:20:41,636
That'll do, Mother!

659
01:20:41,762 --> 01:20:43,971
You're pregnant! So what?

660
01:20:45,265 --> 01:20:47,642
There's plenty of room here.

661
01:20:50,104 --> 01:20:52,230
When will it be?

662
01:20:53,482 --> 01:20:54,816
Never!

663
01:21:04,868 --> 01:21:06,744
I had no way of knowing!

664
01:21:16,922 --> 01:21:18,381
Help her.

665
01:21:26,932 --> 01:21:28,933
Why don't you want the child?

666
01:21:35,065 --> 01:21:37,316
It doesn't matter whose it is.

667
01:22:00,966 --> 01:22:02,258
No trumpet playing here.

668
01:22:02,384 --> 01:22:05,678
Go and blow that thing
with your Brown Shirts.

669
01:22:05,804 --> 01:22:08,306
Soon your blowing will all be over.

670
01:22:08,432 --> 01:22:10,433
- Nazi swine!
- Red pig!

671
01:23:32,766 --> 01:23:34,892
What are you doing here?

672
01:23:35,018 --> 01:23:37,061
You got no business here!

673
01:23:38,272 --> 01:23:40,815
Wanna know what you are?

674
01:23:41,984 --> 01:23:44,360
A kike.
That's what you are.

675
01:24:10,387 --> 01:24:12,388
See what they're doing to Markus,

676
01:24:12,514 --> 01:24:14,640
who was baptized
just like them?

677
01:24:17,728 --> 01:24:19,312
Is your drum broken?

678
01:24:20,397 --> 01:24:23,316
Come see me.
You'll have a new drum.

679
01:24:29,573 --> 01:24:31,991
A beautiful day!

680
01:24:32,117 --> 01:24:36,746
She's gone to the place
where everything's so cheap.

681
01:24:36,872 --> 01:24:38,873
Habemus dominum.

682
01:24:38,999 --> 01:24:41,375
Yes, Leo-Meshugge,
it's a beautiful day.

683
01:24:41,501 --> 01:24:43,544
An unforgettable day.

684
01:24:44,129 --> 01:24:45,880
I, too, have seen the Lord.

685
01:24:46,590 --> 01:24:48,466
You've seen the Lord?

686
01:25:09,154 --> 01:25:10,738
A beautiful day.

687
01:25:16,828 --> 01:25:20,748
The Lord has passed.

688
01:25:21,291 --> 01:25:22,667
He was in a hurry.

689
01:28:36,152 --> 01:28:38,863
There once was a drummer.

690
01:28:38,989 --> 01:28:40,698
His name was Oskar.

691
01:28:40,824 --> 01:28:45,703
He lost his poor mama,
who had eaten too much fish.

692
01:28:45,829 --> 01:28:48,998
There once was a gullible people

693
01:28:49,708 --> 01:28:52,418
who believed in Santa Claus.

694
01:28:52,544 --> 01:28:56,171
But Santa Claus was really

695
01:28:56,298 --> 01:28:58,257
the gas man!

696
01:29:34,794 --> 01:29:38,213
There once was a toy merchant.

697
01:29:39,591 --> 01:29:42,551
His name was Sigismund Markus,

698
01:29:44,679 --> 01:29:49,308
and he sold tin drums
lacquered red and white.

699
01:29:57,651 --> 01:30:00,903
There was once a drummer.

700
01:30:02,238 --> 01:30:04,114
His name was Oskar.

701
01:30:14,042 --> 01:30:17,211
There once was a toy merchant

702
01:30:17,337 --> 01:30:19,213
whose name was Markus...

703
01:30:20,507 --> 01:30:24,510
and he took all the toys
in the world away with him.

704
01:31:08,555 --> 01:31:11,223
German Danzig Sentinel!

705
01:31:24,738 --> 01:31:27,489
September 1, 1939.

706
01:31:29,367 --> 01:31:32,036
You know the date, I assume.

707
01:31:33,496 --> 01:31:36,206
That was when I committed
my second crime.

708
01:31:37,709 --> 01:31:40,252
For I, Oskar the drummer,

709
01:31:40,378 --> 01:31:44,256
not only drummed
my poor mama into her grave.

710
01:31:44,382 --> 01:31:45,674
I also dragged

711
01:31:45,800 --> 01:31:50,679
my poor uncle, and presumably
my father, Jan Bronski,

712
01:31:50,805 --> 01:31:53,098
to the Polish post office,

713
01:31:53,224 --> 01:31:56,060
so causing his death.

714
01:32:00,315 --> 01:32:02,649
Halt. You can't go through.

715
01:32:02,776 --> 01:32:05,235
Off limits. Nobody's allowed in.

716
01:32:07,906 --> 01:32:10,908
We only want to see Kobyella.

717
01:32:12,368 --> 01:32:14,286
He's a Pole! Stop him!

718
01:32:22,253 --> 01:32:23,670
It's high time.

719
01:32:23,797 --> 01:32:25,631
The ammunition's over there.

720
01:32:57,413 --> 01:32:59,206
What are you doing here?

721
01:32:59,332 --> 01:33:00,958
Kobyella. Repair drum!

722
01:33:01,084 --> 01:33:05,045
Impossible.
He has no time for you now.

723
01:33:10,927 --> 01:33:12,553
Go and hide somewhere, Oskar.

724
01:33:12,679 --> 01:33:15,013
I have to stay here.
Go on, hurry.

725
01:33:20,854 --> 01:33:22,688
September 1st.

726
01:33:22,814 --> 01:33:24,940
German territory was violated.

727
01:33:26,234 --> 01:33:28,694
Last night, for the first time,

728
01:33:28,820 --> 01:33:33,031
Poles opened fire on German soil

729
01:33:33,491 --> 01:33:36,034
with regular troops.

730
01:33:36,703 --> 01:33:41,165
Since 5:45 this morning
their fire has been returned.

731
01:34:04,939 --> 01:34:08,817
From now on,
bomb will be answered with bomb.

732
01:35:52,338 --> 01:35:53,588
The drum!

733
01:35:59,387 --> 01:36:01,305
Get down!

734
01:36:01,431 --> 01:36:04,474
Oskar, take cover!

735
01:36:06,019 --> 01:36:08,020
You can't stay here, Oskar.

736
01:37:08,873 --> 01:37:11,041
Kobyella, don't give up.

737
01:37:15,338 --> 01:37:18,382
I'll fasten you down.
Then you won't tip over.

738
01:38:07,098 --> 01:38:09,057
One play, 2 contras,

739
01:38:09,183 --> 01:38:12,686
3 schneiders, 4 times clubs
makes 48, or 12 pfennigs.

740
01:38:42,800 --> 01:38:45,886
Hey, don't be a spoilsport.

741
01:38:46,012 --> 01:38:47,679
I can't play by myself.

742
01:38:47,805 --> 01:38:49,764
Pull yourself together.

743
01:38:52,477 --> 01:38:54,019
Kobyella, what's wrong?

744
01:38:57,899 --> 01:38:59,191
Kobyella...

745
01:39:00,651 --> 01:39:02,694
Kobyella, I beg you!

746
01:39:04,489 --> 01:39:06,364
I've got a Grand Hand.

747
01:39:22,215 --> 01:39:23,548
Agnes!

748
01:39:23,674 --> 01:39:25,217
She's dead.

749
01:39:50,034 --> 01:39:51,576
We surrender!

750
01:39:53,079 --> 01:39:54,538
Don't shoot!

751
01:39:57,625 --> 01:39:59,209
Hold your fire!

752
01:41:26,505 --> 01:41:30,550
They filmed us for a newsreel

753
01:41:31,469 --> 01:41:33,887
that was shown
in all the movie houses.

754
01:41:34,013 --> 01:41:38,892
Oskar's experience
at the Polish post office in Danzig

755
01:41:39,018 --> 01:41:42,562
went down in history
as the first battle

756
01:41:42,688 --> 01:41:44,731
of World War II.

757
01:41:50,321 --> 01:41:52,405
The Hanseatic Free City of Danzig

758
01:41:52,531 --> 01:41:55,492
celebrated the union
of its brick Gothic

759
01:41:55,618 --> 01:41:58,411
with the greater German Reich.

760
01:42:00,331 --> 01:42:02,957
This is a big moment in your life.

761
01:42:03,084 --> 01:42:06,252
Keep your eyes open.
You'll have stories to tell!

762
01:42:06,379 --> 01:42:09,547
I think I'll faint if he looks at me!

763
01:42:09,674 --> 01:42:11,257
Here he comes!

764
01:42:29,485 --> 01:42:31,069
I have seen the Lord.

765
01:42:32,947 --> 01:42:34,280
Come with me.

766
01:42:35,199 --> 01:42:36,533
I'll show you something.

767
01:43:04,770 --> 01:43:07,021
They shot Jan Bronski?

768
01:43:11,110 --> 01:43:12,485
Over there.

769
01:43:19,326 --> 01:43:22,454
They gathered up

770
01:43:23,414 --> 01:43:25,874
all the cartridge cases.

771
01:43:26,792 --> 01:43:29,377
All but one.

772
01:43:30,588 --> 01:43:33,798
They always forget one.

773
01:43:56,697 --> 01:43:59,991
This is Maria.
She wants to work for you.

774
01:44:18,511 --> 01:44:22,096
You said you needed somebody
for the customers.

775
01:44:23,641 --> 01:44:25,809
Things can't go on like this.

776
01:44:27,561 --> 01:44:29,521
And for Oskar here.

777
01:44:30,439 --> 01:44:33,650
Hail Mary, full of grace...

778
01:44:43,244 --> 01:44:45,286
Lord, give us...

779
01:44:45,412 --> 01:44:47,622
...faith, and take me up to heaven.

780
01:44:54,421 --> 01:44:56,089
Have you gone to the bathroom?

781
01:44:59,051 --> 01:45:00,802
Another tune?

782
01:45:00,928 --> 01:45:03,346
"Mary, My Adoration."

783
01:45:33,711 --> 01:45:35,211
Go away!

784
01:45:51,729 --> 01:45:54,939
Disregarding
my anonymous infatuations,

785
01:45:56,066 --> 01:45:58,902
Maria was my first love.

786
01:47:30,786 --> 01:47:32,203
How old are you?

787
01:47:32,329 --> 01:47:33,830
Just turned 16.

788
01:47:33,956 --> 01:47:35,206
Me too.

789
01:47:37,876 --> 01:47:39,752
I can't believe it.

790
01:48:07,281 --> 01:48:09,449
Maria smelled of vanilla.

791
01:48:10,325 --> 01:48:12,076
I wondered why.

792
01:48:12,202 --> 01:48:14,704
Did she rub herself with some root?

793
01:48:15,831 --> 01:48:20,918
Was it some cheap perfume
that she sprayed herself with?

794
01:48:21,045 --> 01:48:23,421
Oskar resolved to find out.

795
01:50:08,068 --> 01:50:09,694
What are you doing?

796
01:50:17,995 --> 01:50:19,328
Hey, stop it!

797
01:50:39,183 --> 01:50:41,100
You little rascal.

798
01:50:41,226 --> 01:50:43,936
You dive in, not knowing a thing.

799
01:50:53,739 --> 01:50:56,866
As I predicted:

800
01:50:57,951 --> 01:51:02,538
France in five weeks.
Our boys reach the Channel

801
01:51:02,664 --> 01:51:05,499
and from there, a stone's throw away.

802
01:51:06,418 --> 01:51:08,377
One can spit at London.

803
01:51:08,503 --> 01:51:13,049
As for me: Promoted to cell leader.

804
01:51:13,175 --> 01:51:15,843
Let's drink to that!

805
01:51:16,970 --> 01:51:18,429
Where is that thing?

806
01:51:25,270 --> 01:51:28,314
- Coming back late?
- Could be, little one.

807
01:51:28,440 --> 01:51:30,691
Too many victories to celebrate.

808
01:51:35,072 --> 01:51:36,822
Here's your candy.

809
01:51:38,492 --> 01:51:39,951
You're all set.

810
01:51:40,077 --> 01:51:41,702
You can sleep with Maria.

811
01:51:41,828 --> 01:51:44,789
There's plenty of room
in my bed for Oskar.

812
01:51:44,915 --> 01:51:46,958
He's just a shrimp.

813
01:51:48,210 --> 01:51:50,795
Quick, Oskar, into the hay.

814
01:51:55,175 --> 01:51:56,968
Look. He's so happy.

815
01:54:45,095 --> 01:54:46,846
It's a quarter to.

816
01:54:46,972 --> 01:54:49,932
A little more. Just a little.

817
01:54:51,810 --> 01:54:53,436
But be careful.

818
01:54:53,562 --> 01:54:55,396
Don't worry.

819
01:55:00,444 --> 01:55:02,528
Almost. Almost.

820
01:55:03,697 --> 01:55:06,115
Just a little more.
But be careful!

821
01:55:06,241 --> 01:55:08,117
I am!

822
01:55:11,371 --> 01:55:12,413
Go away!

823
01:55:24,843 --> 01:55:26,135
Alfred, stop it!

824
01:55:26,261 --> 01:55:29,096
Is it the kid's fault
if you're not careful?

825
01:55:29,222 --> 01:55:32,933
Me? Who kept asking for more?

826
01:55:33,059 --> 01:55:37,271
I said, "Be careful.
It's coming soon."

827
01:55:37,397 --> 01:55:39,899
Never enough.
You're all the same.

828
01:55:40,775 --> 01:55:44,195
In, out, finished.
That's your idea of love.

829
01:55:44,321 --> 01:55:46,238
Well, go look for somebody else.

830
01:55:46,364 --> 01:55:49,116
Think I'm some kind of electric bell?

831
01:55:49,242 --> 01:55:51,535
And you never take precautions!

832
01:55:51,661 --> 01:55:55,122
Stop bawling. I'm fed up.

833
01:55:56,541 --> 01:55:59,210
Then go back
to your comrades, you jerk.

834
01:55:59,336 --> 01:56:02,880
I need a change, that's for sure.

835
01:56:03,006 --> 01:56:04,798
They're all quick squirters!

836
01:56:04,925 --> 01:56:07,468
Beat it!

837
01:56:07,594 --> 01:56:10,513
Get yourself a POW
if you're in heat.

838
01:56:10,639 --> 01:56:13,015
Maybe the Frog
that brings the beer.

839
01:56:13,141 --> 01:56:15,059
Maybe he'll satisfy you!

840
01:56:25,070 --> 01:56:28,614
I see love as something
more than smuttiness.

841
01:56:29,783 --> 01:56:32,576
Next time I'll play cards.

842
01:58:00,999 --> 01:58:03,375
You nasty little dwarf!

843
01:58:03,501 --> 01:58:05,878
You crazy midget!

844
01:58:06,004 --> 01:58:09,715
You belong in the loony bin,
you scumbag!

845
01:58:28,318 --> 01:58:30,486
Oskar, I didn't mean it.

846
01:59:01,976 --> 01:59:03,644
Now you'll have your own room.

847
01:59:03,770 --> 01:59:05,521
He'll soon be 17.

848
02:00:21,389 --> 02:00:23,307
They're doing fine in the East.

849
02:00:26,436 --> 02:00:28,187
Leningrad will fall any day.

850
02:00:28,313 --> 02:00:30,939
Kiev's more important
because of the oil.

851
02:00:31,065 --> 02:00:34,777
That was fast! Much faster
than in '15, when I was in the army.

852
02:00:34,903 --> 02:00:36,695
Moscow's the main thing.

853
02:00:38,448 --> 02:00:39,865
Alfred, you carve.

854
02:00:41,159 --> 02:00:43,327
What would we do
without Grandma?

855
02:00:44,454 --> 02:00:46,955
The Kashubians
are still good for something.

856
02:00:47,081 --> 02:00:49,708
Oh, if I could only be out there!

857
02:00:50,919 --> 02:00:53,754
But I'm needed on the home front.

858
02:00:53,880 --> 02:00:56,089
Moscow must be wiped out,

859
02:00:56,216 --> 02:00:58,801
or we'll have to feed
all those people.

860
02:00:58,927 --> 02:01:00,385
The Führer knows that.

861
02:01:01,221 --> 02:01:04,973
They've sent
my Herbert to the front.

862
02:01:06,810 --> 02:01:08,268
To make him fight.

863
02:01:08,394 --> 02:01:10,187
Disciplinary battalion...

864
02:01:11,356 --> 02:01:14,858
Starve 'em!
Starve all our enemies!

865
02:01:16,653 --> 02:01:19,321
- Breast or drumstick?
- Drumstick.

866
02:01:23,201 --> 02:01:24,993
It's nice and juicy.

867
02:01:25,119 --> 02:01:27,162
The nations of Europe
are all on our side.

868
02:01:27,288 --> 02:01:28,664
The stalwart Finns.

869
02:01:28,790 --> 02:01:30,624
No goose without sage!

870
02:01:30,750 --> 02:01:32,167
The Magyars, the Rumanians.

871
02:01:32,293 --> 02:01:35,128
Oskar, what a splendid feast.

872
02:01:39,634 --> 02:01:42,261
No goose, Greff?

873
02:01:42,387 --> 02:01:44,054
You know I don't eat meat.

874
02:02:12,041 --> 02:02:16,795
Now you've got a little brother.

875
02:02:16,921 --> 02:02:18,964
You'll soon be able to play with him.

876
02:02:19,090 --> 02:02:21,717
The butcher's son was killed.

877
02:02:21,843 --> 02:02:24,386
He got the Iron Cross first class.

878
02:02:24,512 --> 02:02:26,013
Second class!

879
02:02:29,559 --> 02:02:31,685
In any case, he's dead.

880
02:02:32,770 --> 02:02:34,938
Kurt, my son.

881
02:02:36,357 --> 02:02:38,859
You are definitely my son.

882
02:02:40,653 --> 02:02:43,196
When you're three,

883
02:02:43,323 --> 02:02:44,990
I'll give you a drum,

884
02:02:45,825 --> 02:02:48,160
and if you don't want to grow up,

885
02:02:48,286 --> 02:02:50,245
I'll show you how it's done.

886
02:03:02,717 --> 02:03:05,135
Come on up!

887
02:03:07,764 --> 02:03:10,223
You'll freeze out there!

888
02:03:20,401 --> 02:03:21,944
Want to come in?

889
02:03:48,179 --> 02:03:49,930
Come a little closer, Oskar.

890
02:03:51,766 --> 02:03:53,976
Come under the covers
where it's warm.

891
02:03:54,102 --> 02:03:55,602
It's dreadfully cold.

892
02:03:56,521 --> 02:03:58,689
Greff doesn't give us enough heat.

893
02:03:58,815 --> 02:03:59,982
Come in!

894
02:04:22,839 --> 02:04:24,840
Greff wants to harden his body.

895
02:04:26,592 --> 02:04:28,927
He loves youth and hard bodies,

896
02:04:29,053 --> 02:04:31,096
but he likes boys more than girls.

897
02:04:43,985 --> 02:04:46,236
My feet are frozen.

898
02:04:46,362 --> 02:04:48,155
A scout is never cold!

899
02:05:53,554 --> 02:05:54,805
Help!

900
02:06:47,775 --> 02:06:49,484
An autograph, please.

901
02:06:56,826 --> 02:06:59,286
May I make the same request?

902
02:07:00,830 --> 02:07:02,664
I loved your show.

903
02:07:11,090 --> 02:07:13,175
My dear Oskar!

904
02:07:14,302 --> 02:07:17,554
How glad I am
to see you again!

905
02:07:17,680 --> 02:07:19,764
Didn't I tell you?

906
02:07:19,891 --> 02:07:22,350
We're too little to lose each other.

907
02:07:23,686 --> 02:07:26,563
Splendid, splendid!
You haven't grown an inch.

908
02:07:28,566 --> 02:07:29,983
Roswitha!

909
02:07:32,737 --> 02:07:35,238
Permit me to introduce Oskar,

910
02:07:35,364 --> 02:07:38,158
an old friend
who sings glass to bits.

911
02:07:39,076 --> 02:07:41,369
Signorina Roswitha Raguna,

912
02:07:41,495 --> 02:07:43,955
the great somnambulist.

913
02:07:44,081 --> 02:07:46,750
The joy of our soldiers
on every front,

914
02:07:47,752 --> 02:07:49,377
and of my old age.

915
02:07:59,805 --> 02:08:02,682
You're surprised to see me
in this uniform,

916
02:08:03,768 --> 02:08:07,437
but the Propaganda Ministry
approached us

917
02:08:07,563 --> 02:08:09,439
and asked us to appear

918
02:08:09,565 --> 02:08:11,900
before the country's top leaders.

919
02:08:12,944 --> 02:08:14,778
Filthy politics!

920
02:08:14,904 --> 02:08:17,239
And now we entertain the troops.

921
02:08:36,759 --> 02:08:38,468
A present from Oskar.

922
02:08:49,021 --> 02:08:50,730
Join us, young man.

923
02:08:50,856 --> 02:08:52,023
Play your drum,

924
02:08:52,149 --> 02:08:55,777
sing light bulbs
and champagne glasses to bits.

925
02:08:55,903 --> 02:08:58,655
The German army of occupation
in fair France,

926
02:08:58,781 --> 02:09:01,658
in gay Paris, will thank you.

927
02:09:19,385 --> 02:09:22,679
Dear tin soldiers of Paris,

928
02:09:22,805 --> 02:09:26,641
Bebra's Front Line Theatre
will play for you,

929
02:09:26,767 --> 02:09:28,268
sing for you,

930
02:09:28,394 --> 02:09:31,229
and help you win the war!

931
02:09:41,365 --> 02:09:43,491
What are you thinking about?

932
02:09:45,077 --> 02:09:47,662
My grandmother's skirts.

933
02:09:59,425 --> 02:10:01,760
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

934
02:10:02,678 --> 02:10:05,096
for the first time in France,

935
02:10:05,222 --> 02:10:07,766
a newcomer to our program,

936
02:10:08,434 --> 02:10:10,685
the man with the secret weapon

937
02:10:10,811 --> 02:10:13,355
we have heard so much about:

938
02:10:14,273 --> 02:10:16,566
Oskar the drummer!

939
02:10:16,692 --> 02:10:20,612
Oskar the glass killer!

940
02:10:23,949 --> 02:10:25,283
Mazel tov.

941
02:10:45,638 --> 02:10:48,765
And now, Signorina Raguna,

942
02:10:48,891 --> 02:10:52,018
could you tell us,

943
02:10:52,144 --> 02:10:55,021
as well as the ladies and gentlemen
present tonight,

944
02:10:56,023 --> 02:10:58,608
the exact date of birth

945
02:10:58,734 --> 02:11:01,778
of Lieutenant Herzog?

946
02:11:03,114 --> 02:11:06,658
April 11,

947
02:11:07,576 --> 02:11:11,496
1915,

948
02:11:13,207 --> 02:11:14,666
in Bremen.

949
02:11:15,292 --> 02:11:17,001
That's right.

950
02:11:17,128 --> 02:11:18,336
And the place too.

951
02:11:19,797 --> 02:11:24,175
Signorina Raguna,
the great somnambulist!

952
02:11:27,680 --> 02:11:32,517
I see they're bringing him champagne.

953
02:11:32,643 --> 02:11:36,104
But you'll never drink it.

954
02:11:37,189 --> 02:11:38,189
Why not?

955
02:12:11,515 --> 02:12:13,433
All together!

956
02:12:13,559 --> 02:12:17,896
Is the black witch here today?
No, no, no!

957
02:12:39,293 --> 02:12:40,543
Don't be afraid.

958
02:12:40,669 --> 02:12:42,420
Nothing will happen.

959
02:12:49,345 --> 02:12:51,804
My little man...

960
02:13:24,922 --> 02:13:27,966
One corporal, five men,
nothing to report.

961
02:13:30,386 --> 02:13:32,095
Thank you.
At ease, Corporal.

962
02:13:32,221 --> 02:13:34,639
You see? Nothing to report.

963
02:13:35,558 --> 02:13:37,600
It's been this way for years.

964
02:13:37,726 --> 02:13:41,646
There's always the tide,
nature's contribution.

965
02:13:41,772 --> 02:13:43,982
That's what keeps our men busy.

966
02:13:44,900 --> 02:13:47,443
That's why we go on
building bunkers.

967
02:13:47,570 --> 02:13:50,029
You have faith in concrete?

968
02:13:50,155 --> 02:13:52,323
We haven't much faith in anything.

969
02:13:52,950 --> 02:13:54,075
Am I right, Corporal?

970
02:13:54,201 --> 02:13:56,494
Right, sir. In nothing!

971
02:13:56,620 --> 02:13:58,830
But still you mix and pour.

972
02:14:42,041 --> 02:14:44,167
Embrace, children.

973
02:14:44,293 --> 02:14:46,461
Today, we play on concrete.

974
02:14:47,212 --> 02:14:50,632
Tomorrow
it will make your teeth grind

975
02:14:50,758 --> 02:14:53,051
and spoil your kisses.

976
02:14:57,014 --> 02:15:00,308
Is the black witch here today?
No, no, no!

977
02:15:00,434 --> 02:15:03,478
She will make an evil brew,
she will put you in her stew

978
02:15:03,604 --> 02:15:05,188
And then she will devour you

979
02:15:05,314 --> 02:15:07,899
Is the black witch here today?
Yes, yes, yes!

980
02:15:08,025 --> 02:15:11,444
Look, there she is!

981
02:15:26,669 --> 02:15:28,711
A picnic in the open air!

982
02:15:30,673 --> 02:15:33,925
Nature gives us appetite!

983
02:15:37,554 --> 02:15:40,848
Real Hungarian salami. Wonderful!

984
02:15:40,974 --> 02:15:44,018
And chocolate from Holland!

985
02:15:44,812 --> 02:15:48,314
Enjoy your meal!

986
02:15:57,157 --> 02:15:58,658
Caviar!

987
02:16:00,744 --> 02:16:03,079
Rescued from Stalingrad.

988
02:16:43,912 --> 02:16:46,622
Tell me, Corporal Lankes.

989
02:16:46,749 --> 02:16:47,957
Over there I see...

990
02:16:48,876 --> 02:16:51,961
...five black spots on the beach.

991
02:16:55,716 --> 02:16:58,926
These are the nuns from Lisieux.
They come at low tide

992
02:16:59,052 --> 02:17:01,304
to pick up mussels and shrimp.

993
02:17:17,029 --> 02:17:19,030
Dora 7, Corporal Lankes speaking.

994
02:17:19,156 --> 02:17:23,910
Corporal, I see movement upfront!
Are you blind?

995
02:17:24,036 --> 02:17:25,953
They're nuns, Lieutenant.

996
02:17:26,079 --> 02:17:28,706
What if they were a fifth column?

997
02:17:28,832 --> 02:17:30,500
Yes, Lieutenant.

998
02:17:30,626 --> 02:17:33,544
Clear the beach!
It's off limits!

999
02:17:35,172 --> 02:17:37,507
They're just looking for shellfish.

1000
02:17:37,633 --> 02:17:39,050
I know them.

1001
02:17:39,176 --> 02:17:41,219
That's an order!

1002
02:17:41,345 --> 02:17:42,428
Yes, Lieutenant.

1003
02:19:23,030 --> 02:19:24,280
Come in!

1004
02:19:26,199 --> 02:19:28,159
Children! Quick!

1005
02:19:30,329 --> 02:19:32,163
The Americans are coming.

1006
02:19:53,435 --> 02:19:56,020
Oskar, I must have coffee!

1007
02:19:56,897 --> 02:19:59,523
Roswitha, we're leaving.

1008
02:20:48,073 --> 02:20:50,116
Roswitha,

1009
02:20:50,242 --> 02:20:53,244
I don't know how old you were.

1010
02:20:53,370 --> 02:20:56,414
I only know
that you smelled of cinnamon

1011
02:20:56,540 --> 02:20:58,958
and nutmeg.

1012
02:20:59,084 --> 02:21:02,336
You could see
into the hearts of men,

1013
02:21:03,296 --> 02:21:07,550
but not into your own heart.

1014
02:21:09,886 --> 02:21:11,804
Ah, dear Oskar,

1015
02:21:11,930 --> 02:21:15,349
we dwarfs and fools
shouldn't dance on concrete

1016
02:21:15,475 --> 02:21:18,019
that was poured for giants.

1017
02:21:23,608 --> 02:21:27,111
Good luck! And keep your chin up!

1018
02:22:15,160 --> 02:22:18,913
Hey, Kurt, Oskar's come back
for your birthday.

1019
02:22:20,707 --> 02:22:23,084
Your little brother
just turned three.

1020
02:22:23,210 --> 02:22:25,586
I brought you a present.

1021
02:22:50,904 --> 02:22:53,656
Are you allowed
to wear that uniform?

1022
02:22:55,325 --> 02:22:57,118
Where have you been?

1023
02:22:58,411 --> 02:23:00,037
We looked all over for you.

1024
02:23:00,163 --> 02:23:02,248
The police looked high and low.

1025
02:23:02,374 --> 02:23:05,918
We had to swear
we hadn't bumped you off.

1026
02:23:07,420 --> 02:23:09,755
Anyhow, you're back!

1027
02:23:10,715 --> 02:23:12,591
I'll prepare something to eat.

1028
02:23:12,717 --> 02:23:14,218
You must be starving.

1029
02:23:15,345 --> 02:23:17,429
I'll draw you a bath.

1030
02:23:19,015 --> 02:23:21,183
You've caused nothing but trouble.

1031
02:23:21,309 --> 02:23:23,352
They wanted to put you
in a clinic.

1032
02:23:23,478 --> 02:23:25,980
You deserve it,
running away as you did.

1033
02:23:30,026 --> 02:23:32,361
The Gestapo... Hide!

1034
02:23:51,214 --> 02:23:53,591
No news, gentlemen.

1035
02:23:53,717 --> 02:23:55,467
We're desperate.

1036
02:23:55,594 --> 02:23:58,846
The abnormal child has been sighted.

1037
02:23:58,972 --> 02:24:02,099
Here in Langfuhr?

1038
02:24:02,225 --> 02:24:05,853
You should have reported it,
not a neighbour.

1039
02:24:07,272 --> 02:24:09,773
As we had agreed.

1040
02:24:12,611 --> 02:24:15,487
The child
needs treatment.

1041
02:24:15,614 --> 02:24:17,615
He can't be seen
on the street anymore.

1042
02:24:18,200 --> 02:24:19,408
That may be, but...

1043
02:24:22,120 --> 02:24:27,333
As a Party member, you should share
the Führer's concern

1044
02:24:27,459 --> 02:24:29,168
for racial purity.

1045
02:24:29,294 --> 02:24:35,466
Here's the warrant to put the kid
in the clinic at Kohlhammer.

1046
02:24:39,679 --> 02:24:41,889
I won't let him be put away!

1047
02:24:42,015 --> 02:24:44,391
Mr. Matzerath, just sign here.

1048
02:24:44,517 --> 02:24:46,143
Never!

1049
02:24:46,269 --> 02:24:49,313
I promised my wife
on her deathbed.

1050
02:24:50,148 --> 02:24:52,316
I'm his father,

1051
02:24:52,442 --> 02:24:55,027
not the race bureau!

1052
02:24:56,404 --> 02:24:59,073
I've agreed with everything,
but this, never!

1053
02:25:00,200 --> 02:25:01,659
It's going too far.

1054
02:25:02,494 --> 02:25:04,536
I won't do it.

1055
02:25:05,413 --> 02:25:07,373
My own son...

1056
02:25:07,499 --> 02:25:10,000
They all say it should be done.

1057
02:25:13,338 --> 02:25:16,548
Obviously they don't have children.

1058
02:25:16,675 --> 02:25:18,425
Calm down.

1059
02:25:18,551 --> 02:25:20,219
You'll wake up the kid.

1060
02:25:25,433 --> 02:25:27,559
You think this means nothing to me?

1061
02:25:28,770 --> 02:25:32,106
But they all say
that's how it's done now.

1062
02:25:34,234 --> 02:25:37,653
Many have left,
nobody has ever come back.

1063
02:25:38,822 --> 02:25:42,032
Agnes would have never
put up with this.

1064
02:25:43,243 --> 02:25:47,538
Yes, but she was his mother,
and hoped he would get better.

1065
02:25:47,664 --> 02:25:49,039
You can see...

1066
02:25:51,668 --> 02:25:53,085
...that he hasn't.

1067
02:25:53,211 --> 02:25:56,046
He can neither live nor die.

1068
02:25:57,132 --> 02:25:58,632
No way!

1069
02:26:39,257 --> 02:26:41,842
Beethoven.
Now there was a genius.

1070
02:26:54,064 --> 02:26:56,690
What have they done with us?

1071
02:26:57,942 --> 02:27:00,486
Turn it off. It's all over.

1072
02:27:00,612 --> 02:27:02,029
Final victory!

1073
02:27:21,633 --> 02:27:26,428
Alfred, get rid of your party pin.
The Russkis will be here any minute.

1074
02:27:31,893 --> 02:27:34,395
Bury it under the potatoes.

1075
02:30:55,930 --> 02:30:57,848
Good morning to you.

1076
02:30:57,974 --> 02:30:59,975
Excuse me.

1077
02:31:00,101 --> 02:31:02,811
Is this the Matzerath grocery store?

1078
02:31:21,623 --> 02:31:23,874
And you are Mrs. Matzerath?

1079
02:31:32,216 --> 02:31:33,717
Luba,

1080
02:31:33,843 --> 02:31:35,385
look at the scale!

1081
02:31:36,262 --> 02:31:38,430
A real decimal scale!

1082
02:31:40,808 --> 02:31:42,142
A fuel tank,

1083
02:31:43,144 --> 02:31:45,312
a sausage spear...

1084
02:31:47,857 --> 02:31:49,775
And the cash register!

1085
02:31:52,487 --> 02:31:55,614
I'm Mr. Fajngold,

1086
02:31:55,740 --> 02:31:57,532
from Lemberg,

1087
02:31:57,659 --> 02:32:01,828
and this is my wife Luba

1088
02:32:02,830 --> 02:32:04,581
and my six children.

1089
02:32:04,707 --> 02:32:06,208
Berek,

1090
02:32:06,334 --> 02:32:07,417
Lev,

1091
02:32:09,420 --> 02:32:10,587
Jakub,

1092
02:32:12,173 --> 02:32:13,465
Mendel,

1093
02:32:14,550 --> 02:32:16,218
Leon...

1094
02:32:17,095 --> 02:32:18,845
and Sonya,

1095
02:32:18,971 --> 02:32:20,764
the apple of my eye.

1096
02:32:24,686 --> 02:32:26,978
Here are the documents.

1097
02:32:27,105 --> 02:32:30,273
Proving we can take over the shop.

1098
02:32:31,984 --> 02:32:35,028
If you'd like,
I could hire you as salesgirl.

1099
02:32:35,154 --> 02:32:39,408
You could stay with your children.

1100
02:32:40,284 --> 02:32:42,953
There is enough room.

1101
02:32:47,375 --> 02:32:48,959
Is that the cellar down there?

1102
02:32:50,837 --> 02:32:52,838
Can we go down?

1103
02:32:52,964 --> 02:32:54,464
If you don't mind.

1104
02:32:58,344 --> 02:33:00,595
Honey, soap.

1105
02:33:01,848 --> 02:33:03,807
Palmolive! It still exists.

1106
02:33:05,435 --> 02:33:09,563
Even flour.
Mr. Matzerath stocked up,

1107
02:33:09,689 --> 02:33:12,065
like a good shopkeeper.

1108
02:33:24,871 --> 02:33:26,705
Mr. Matzerath?

1109
02:33:36,591 --> 02:33:37,799
He was my husband.

1110
02:34:04,243 --> 02:34:05,786
He too was alive once.

1111
02:34:10,541 --> 02:34:12,542
My wife and children,

1112
02:34:13,836 --> 02:34:15,879
they too were lying there.

1113
02:34:16,005 --> 02:34:18,298
Before disappearing into the ovens

1114
02:34:19,967 --> 02:34:21,802
at Treblinka.

1115
02:34:21,928 --> 02:34:23,428
Only I...

1116
02:34:25,973 --> 02:34:27,724
survived,

1117
02:34:28,351 --> 02:34:32,312
spraying the dead
with bleach, chlorine, Lysol.

1118
02:34:35,817 --> 02:34:38,485
I was a disinfector in the camp.

1119
02:34:44,158 --> 02:34:47,953
Luba, help Mrs. Matzerath
wash the body.

1120
02:34:57,463 --> 02:34:58,505
Fajngold!

1121
02:35:09,725 --> 02:35:13,311
Hurry! I've still got shoes to sole.

1122
02:35:18,860 --> 02:35:20,318
His hand!

1123
02:35:21,737 --> 02:35:23,530
It doesn't hurt him now.

1124
02:35:35,334 --> 02:35:37,794
Hail Mary, full of grace...

1125
02:35:40,089 --> 02:35:43,133
Stop throwing stones!

1126
02:35:46,846 --> 02:35:49,723
Should I or shouldn't I?

1127
02:35:50,558 --> 02:35:53,602
You're 21.

1128
02:35:53,728 --> 02:35:54,936
Oskar!

1129
02:35:55,688 --> 02:35:58,231
Should you or shouldn't you?

1130
02:35:59,567 --> 02:36:02,152
You're an orphan.

1131
02:36:09,493 --> 02:36:12,287
I should, I must,

1132
02:36:12,413 --> 02:36:15,206
I will grow!

1133
02:36:29,055 --> 02:36:31,306
Kurt, now what have you done?

1134
02:36:49,325 --> 02:36:50,742
He's growing!

1135
02:36:55,623 --> 02:36:59,459
Look!
See how he's growing!

1136
02:36:59,585 --> 02:37:02,212
I have seen the Lord!

1137
02:37:24,443 --> 02:37:27,696
Just like a Kashubian.

1138
02:37:30,908 --> 02:37:33,243
Our heads were made
for hard knocks.

1139
02:37:34,829 --> 02:37:38,623
And now you're going West,
where things are better.

1140
02:37:40,668 --> 02:37:42,669
Only Grandma will stay here.

1141
02:37:43,921 --> 02:37:46,798
You can't move Kashubians
around like that.

1142
02:37:48,843 --> 02:37:51,553
They have to stay so other people

1143
02:37:53,472 --> 02:37:55,557
can clout them on the head.

1144
02:37:57,810 --> 02:38:00,270
We're not Polish enough

1145
02:38:01,272 --> 02:38:03,189
or German enough,

1146
02:38:03,315 --> 02:38:05,692
and they always want
everything just right.

1147
02:38:12,158 --> 02:38:13,408
Would you...

1148
02:38:14,577 --> 02:38:16,369
...marry me, Maria?

1149
02:38:18,414 --> 02:38:22,167
You wouldn't have to leave,
with the children.

1150
02:38:25,087 --> 02:38:26,421
It isn't possible.

1151
02:38:28,299 --> 02:38:30,383
Nothing works here.

1152
02:38:32,636 --> 02:38:34,054
It's all over.

1153
02:38:41,729 --> 02:38:44,064
Take this for the journey.

1154
02:38:45,441 --> 02:38:46,900
It's margarine

1155
02:38:47,860 --> 02:38:49,444
and artificial honey.

1156
02:38:50,863 --> 02:38:52,155
And some Lysol.

1157
02:38:52,281 --> 02:38:54,240
It's always useful.

1158
02:39:00,247 --> 02:39:02,082
We're going to the Rhineland,

1159
02:39:03,459 --> 02:39:05,335
to my sister's.

1160
02:39:06,337 --> 02:39:08,671
I understand.
Maybe it's better...

1161
02:39:09,882 --> 02:39:11,716
in the West.

1162
02:39:13,719 --> 02:39:15,220
Does it hurt?

1163
02:39:16,472 --> 02:39:18,598
I hope it's not water on the brain.

1164
02:39:19,683 --> 02:39:22,894
When he was three, he fell down
the stairs and stopped growing.
