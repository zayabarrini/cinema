I wrote for the piano.

and putting it into an opera I'm working on.

Would it interest -

164
00:19:40,412 --> 00:19:43,006
I shouldn't be able to pay you
much money at first, of course -

165

eight pounds a week and expenses.

166
00:19:47,786 --> 00:19:49,811

and come over to Covent Garden.

171

you'll destroy it immediately
and forget all about it.

Mr. Craster, I must ask you
to exercise in future...

340
00:31:38,329 --> 00:31:41,492
a little more control
over your natural ambitions.

341
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:45,933
Why you should have chosen Heart of Fire
for this early morning escapade -

00:31:46,037 --> 00:31:47,937
Good morning, gentlemen -

343
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:51,167
is a mystery
that I shall never hope to solve.

00:31:51,276 --> 00:31:54,643
May I see that wrong note
in the score, please?

345
00:31:57,448 --> 00:32:01,384
Mmm. However, there are
passages in Heart of Fire...

346
00:32:01,486 --> 00:32:04,580
which no one need be ashamed of.

347

who runs the ballet here.

Oh. Business or pleasure?

Oh, a bit of both.
What about you - shopping or slumming?

I would like to say to you today.

As you know,
the ballet is leaving on Saturday for Paris.

Now, I can't imagine
anything more enchanting...

379
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:48,172
than being able to invite you -
all of you - to accompany us there.

380
00:35:48,279 --> 00:35:51,180
But I'm afraid
this great pleasure must be denied me.

regretfully leave behind...

382
00:35:54,285 --> 00:35:57,686
I'd like to say just this -
please, don't be discouraged.

383
00:35:57,788 --> 00:36:01,690
The fact that we can't take you with us
doesn't mean that you are bad dancers.

384
00:36:01,792 --> 00:36:05,990
It means that this year, unfortunately,
we haven't got enough room.

508
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:39,431
and I've decided to give you a chance
and let you dance the principal part in it.

509
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:44,045
But there's one thing
I must tell you at once.

510
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:49,175
My belief in your possibilities
is not shared by my colleagues here.

511
00:49:53,623 --> 00:49:56,183
However, it is hardly necessary
for me to add...

512
00:49:56,293 --> 00:50:00,730
that, whatever their personal belief may be,
they will all give you their best.

513
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:03,527
The rest, of course, is up to you.

514
00:50:04,868 --> 00:50:07,666
Well, Miss Page, that's all.

515
00:50:07,771 --> 00:50:10,604
We shall start work
early tomorrow morning.

516
00:50:10,707 --> 00:50:14,268
I suggest you now forget all about
your party and go straight home to bed.

517
00:50:15,479 --> 00:50:17,709
Yes, I will.

518
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:24,654
And, Miss Page...

519
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:28,690
good luck.

520
00:50:28,792 --> 00:50:30,760
Thank you.

521
00:50:34,297 --> 00:50:36,197
- [Piano]
- Well, what happened?

522
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:40,367
I've got a part in a new ballet.

523
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:42,961
- [Continues]
- A new ballet? What ballet?

524
00:50:43,073 --> 00:50:45,268
The Red Shoes!

525
00:50:48,278 --> 00:50:50,439
Now listen to this, Mr. Craster.
It is impossible.

526
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:54,950
Well, I couldn't rewrite that bit,
could I?

527
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:57,486
- Why not?
- You didn't blue-pencil it.

528
00:50:57,587 --> 00:51:00,420
Horrors like that don't need to be blue-penciled.
They speak for themselves.

529
00:51:00,524 --> 00:51:03,425
Well, as a matter of fact,
I did have some ideas about that.

530
00:51:03,527 --> 00:51:06,087
Where are they, my dear fellow?
We need a score.

531
00:51:06,196 --> 00:51:08,255
If you'll allow me.

532
00:51:12,369 --> 00:51:14,269
Well, it's the church scene.

533
00:51:14,371 --> 00:51:16,601
Let's get rid
of this sentimental hymn tune...

534
00:51:16,706 --> 00:51:18,765
and take a foursquare chorale.

535
00:51:18,875 --> 00:51:20,775
Something like this.

536
00:51:27,717 --> 00:51:30,345
Then, I thought, all the way through,
we might have a church bell coming in.

537
00:51:41,832 --> 00:51:43,800
All of a sudden, the strings -

538
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:46,368
[Humming]

539
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:50,907
Then as the priest appears,
it's taken up with the brass.

00:51:51,007 --> 00:51:55,034

541
00:51:55,145 --> 00:51:57,375

542
00:51:59,583 --> 00:52:02,484
Shall I play you
"The Dance of the Red Shoes"?

543
00:52:08,859 --> 00:52:11,760
Thank you, Mr. Craster.
Thank you.

544
00:52:15,699 --> 00:52:18,065
This time, I want you
to change everything.

545
00:52:18,168 --> 00:52:20,636
I want a new score.

546
00:52:20,737 --> 00:52:23,467
There you are, Mr. Lermontov.

547
00:52:23,573 --> 00:52:26,235
And where's the orchestration?

548
00:52:26,343 --> 00:52:28,675
- When do you want it?
- Yesterday.

549
00:52:28,778 --> 00:52:31,008
You said you wanted to work, didn't you?
Then go home and work.

550
00:52:31,114 --> 00:52:33,309
I don't want to see your face anywhere
until you've finished it.

551
00:52:33,416 --> 00:52:35,111
You won't!

00:52:59,609 --> 00:53:01,702
Why aren't you in bed?

555
00:53:01,811 --> 00:53:05,247
- Oh, you gave me quite a fright.
- I meant to.

556
00:53:09,819 --> 00:53:11,719
Why aren't you in bed?

557
00:53:11,821 --> 00:53:14,722
I was ordered to, but I was
much too excited to sleep.

558
00:53:14,824 --> 00:53:17,554
- So here I am.
- Are you? I haven't seen you.

559
00:53:17,661 --> 00:53:20,687
- Thank you.
- By the way, you haven't seen me either.

560
00:53:20,797 --> 00:53:23,129
Has he sent you to bed too?

561
00:53:23,233 --> 00:53:27,169
No, I'm just working on the score
of my new ballet - The Red Shoes.

562
00:53:28,738 --> 00:53:31,434
Is that my ballet too?

563
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:34,066
Yes, I suppose it is.

[Train Approaching]

566
00:53:50,026 --> 00:53:52,927
I wonder what it feels like
to wake up in the morning...

567
00:53:53,029 --> 00:53:55,088
and find oneself famous.

568
00:53:55,198 --> 00:53:58,725
You're not likely to know
if you stay here talking much longer.

569
00:53:58,835 --> 00:54:00,735
So, good luck.

570
00:54:01,771 --> 00:54:03,671
Good luck.

[Piano]

573
00:54:54,257 --> 00:54:56,589
She's putting too much into it.

574
00:54:56,693 --> 00:54:58,820
Why don't you tell her, Grischa?

575
00:54:58,928 --> 00:55:01,158
Mind your own business.

576
00:55:01,264 --> 00:55:04,825
She has to dance with me
at the dance at the fair before this.

577
00:55:04,934 --> 00:55:06,868
And the big stuff still to come.

578
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:10,872
She can't dance everything full out.
She ought to know that.

579
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:13,636
How do you expect her
to know it, Ivan Ivanovitch...

580
00:55:13,743 --> 00:55:16,541
if you never once dance full out yourself
before the opening night?

581
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:26,183
Here are the designs
for the costumes, Boris.

582
00:55:26,289 --> 00:55:28,689
One moment.
Sit down, will you, please?

583
00:55:32,195 --> 00:55:35,687
I'm so sorry, Mr. Ljubov.
Something will have to be done about the music.

584
00:55:35,799 --> 00:55:37,994
She starts the pirouette
a beat too early.

585
00:55:38,101 --> 00:55:40,626
The tempo's wrong.
It's too fast.

586
00:55:40,737 --> 00:55:43,171
- It's the right tempo.
- Of course.

587
00:55:43,273 --> 00:55:45,605
Once more!

588
00:55:51,481 --> 00:55:53,540
- She'll be all right.

Still unconverted, Sergei?

591
00:55:57,854 --> 00:56:01,688
Well, of course,
she's a charming girl, but -

592
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:04,555
Oh, I know nothing about her charms,
and I care less.

593
00:56:04,661 --> 00:56:07,289
But I tell you, they won't wait till the end.
They'll applaud in the middle.

- [Laughing] Oh, come now.
- Sergei, I'll take a bet.

Oh, enough, enough!

596
00:56:16,172 --> 00:56:21,075
Miss Page, we are trying
to create something of beauty.

597
00:56:21,177 --> 00:56:24,169
Might I suggest that while you continue
to wave your arms like a scarecrow...

598
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:26,942
and bend your knees
like an old cart horse...

599
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:29,518
we are unlikely to succeed!

600
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:35,953
Well, well, it's a bet.

- [Chuckles]

609
00:57:24,374 --> 00:57:27,741
Well, at the moment, you look as if
you are finding it a little difficult.

610
00:57:27,844 --> 00:57:29,539
But when we open in two weeks' time...

611
00:57:29,646 --> 00:57:32,274
I hope you'll appear to be finding
the whole thing supremely simple.

612
00:57:34,651 --> 00:57:36,949
And don't forget,
a great impression of simplicity...

613
00:57:37,053 --> 00:57:40,955
can only be achieved
by great agony of body and spirit.

00:57:41,057 --> 00:57:43,685
- Voilà.
- Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

No.

628
00:58:22,966 --> 00:58:27,300
Yes. In this way, you should become
quite familiar with the music.

629
00:58:27,403 --> 00:58:30,031
Yes, I think I probably shall.

00:58:30,139 --> 00:58:33,302

Nothing but the music.

in lunchtime music, don't they?

just at the moment, please?

Let's take the ballroom scene.

641
00:59:12,982 --> 00:59:15,883
That's the most digestible
part of the score.

642
00:59:15,985 --> 00:59:17,919
The ballroom's out. It's been cut.

643
00:59:18,021 --> 00:59:22,549
Cut as a scene,
but it's still there in my score.

I wrote this dance for a ballroom.

645

Anyone who understands anything
about music will see a ballroom.

and you are not a horse.

- It's too fast.
- You would not find it too fast-

669

- Both of you!
- You would not find it too fast...

670
01:01:36,225 --> 01:01:39,592
if you would allow the slow passage to come
to an end before you start your pirouette.

671
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:42,221
My downbeat marks a pause.

N'est-ce pas?

- Impossible.

It's quite simple.

- I think it was the loveliest thing I've ever seen in my life.

And do you know
why it was impossible?

955
01:40:18,812 --> 01:40:22,179

nor her heart were in her work.

at your latest effort -

don't do any more work on the new ballet.

01:45:27,521 --> 01:45:30,217
I want you to tell me
why you've quarreled with Julian.

1016
01:45:30,324 --> 01:45:31,757
There's only three minutes.

1017
01:45:31,858 --> 01:45:34,918
May I suggest, Miss Page, that
such matters are hardly your business?

1018
01:45:37,898 --> 01:45:40,298
However, since you've gone
to all this trouble -

1019
01:45:43,637 --> 01:45:48,233
Mr. Craster's been unwise enough
to interfere with certain plans of mine.

1020
01:45:49,609 --> 01:45:52,077
And that is something I do not permit.

1021
01:45:53,413 --> 01:45:55,313
I thought once, Mr. Lermontov...

1022
01:45:55,415 --> 01:45:58,145
that there would be no room in my life
for anything but dancing.

1023
01:45:59,252 --> 01:46:01,652
You will think so again, my dear.

1024
01:46:01,755 --> 01:46:04,189
But if Julian goes, I shall go too.

1025
01:46:07,227 --> 01:46:09,252
And what exactly
do you intend to do?

1026
01:46:09,363 --> 01:46:13,493
- I shall dance somewhere else.
- Oh, yes.

1027
01:46:13,600 --> 01:46:16,068
That won't be very difficult
with the name I've given you -

1028
01:46:17,371 --> 01:46:21,102
always provided I release you
of your contract.

1029
01:46:22,376 --> 01:46:27,211
But even if I do,
will it be quite the same?

1030
01:46:28,982 --> 01:46:30,950
I have never pretended
to myself that it would.

1031
01:46:34,354 --> 01:46:37,414
I could make you
one of the greatest dancers...

1032
01:46:37,524 --> 01:46:40,391
the world has ever known.

1033
01:46:42,863 --> 01:46:47,527
- Do you believe that?
- Yes, I do.

1034
01:46:49,970 --> 01:46:51,870
And all that means nothing to you?

I hope you didn't work too hard.

to stop her doing anything.

She can dance when and where she likes.

1055
01:50:18,511 --> 01:50:21,912
- Except The Red Shoes.
- What about the boy?

1056
01:50:22,015 --> 01:50:25,280
That's different. Everything he's written
while under contract to me is mine.

1057
01:50:25,385 --> 01:50:29,549
That's in the contract. The Red Shoes
and his work so far on La Belle Meunière.

1058
01:50:29,656 --> 01:50:32,648
I am not interested
in anything else he may write.

1059
01:50:32,759 --> 01:50:36,820
But if you keep The Red Shoes in the repertoire,
you'll have to pay him royalties.

1060

anywhere else in the whole world.

Would you be satisfied
with anything less than the best?

1205
02:05:23,916 --> 02:05:26,384
If you would, you would never be
a great artist. Perhaps you never will.

a great dancer as well? Never.

since you snatched her away from me...

1208

for a chance to win her back?

1209
02:05:36,295 --> 02:05:38,820
- Because you're jealous of her.
- Yes!
