00:01:44,741 --> 00:01:49,906
<i>"Velázquez, past the age of 50,</i>
<i>no longer painted specific objects.</i>

2
00:01:50,113 --> 00:01:54,049
<i>He drifted around things</i>
<i>like the air, like twilight,</i>

3
00:01:54,251 --> 00:01:58,745
<i>catching unawares in the shimmering</i>
<i>shadows the nuances of color</i>

4
00:01:58,955 --> 00:02:03,619
<i>that he transformed into the invisible</i>
<i>core of his silent symphony.</i>

5
00:02:03,827 --> 00:02:06,261
<i>Henceforth, he captured only</i>

6
00:02:06,463 --> 00:02:11,400
<i>those mysterious interpenetrations</i>
<i>that united shape and tone</i>

7
00:02:11,601 --> 00:02:14,195
<i>by means of a secret</i>
<i>but unceasing progression</i>

8
00:02:14,404 --> 00:02:19,671
<i>that no convulsion or cataclysm</i>
<i>could interrupt or impede.</i>

9
00:02:19,876 --> 00:02:21,400
<i>Space reigns supreme.</i>

10
00:02:22,546 --> 00:02:25,743
<i>It's as if some ethereal wave</i>
<i>skimming over surfaces</i>

11
00:02:25,949 --> 00:02:30,545
<i>soaked up their visible emanations</i>
<i>to shape them and give them form</i>

12
00:02:30,754 --> 00:02:33,689
<i>and then spread them</i>
<i>like a perfume,</i>

13
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:35,915
<i>like an echo of themselves,</i>

14
00:02:36,126 --> 00:02:40,654
<i>like some imperceptible dust,</i>
<i>over every surrounding surface.</i>

15
00:02:41,197 --> 00:02:44,064
The world he lived in
was a sad one:

16
00:02:44,267 --> 00:02:47,862
A degenerate king,
sickly <i>infantes,</i>

17
00:02:48,071 --> 00:02:52,007
idiots, dwarfs, cripples,

18
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:55,405
clownish freaks
dressed as princes

19
00:02:55,612 --> 00:02:58,445
whose job it was
to laugh at themselves

20
00:02:58,648 --> 00:03:01,845
and amuse a court
that lived outside the law,

21
00:03:02,052 --> 00:03:06,455
caught in a web
of etiquette, plots and lies,

22
00:03:06,656 --> 00:03:10,023
bound by the confessional
and their own remorse.

23
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:15,026
Outside the gates,
the auto-da-fé and silence..."

24
00:03:17,801 --> 00:03:19,792
Listen to this, little girl.

25
00:03:22,372 --> 00:03:24,431
"A spirit of nostalgia prevails,

26
00:03:24,641 --> 00:03:27,041
yet we see none
of the ugliness or sadness,

27
00:03:27,243 --> 00:03:30,940
none of the gloom or cruelty
of this crushed childhood.

28
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:36,544
Velázquez is the painter
of the evening,

29
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:40,415
of open spaces and of silence,

30
00:03:40,624 --> 00:03:45,493
even when he paints
in broad daylight or in a closed room,

31
00:03:45,695 --> 00:03:49,256
even with the din of battle
or of the hunt in his ears.

32
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:52,563
As they seldom
went out during the day,

33
00:03:52,769 --> 00:03:55,738
when everything was drowned
in torrid sunshine,

34
00:03:56,006 --> 00:03:59,772
Spanish painters
communed with the evening."

35
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:02,175
Beautiful, isn't it, little girl?

36
00:04:02,379 --> 00:04:04,870
You're crazy to read her
things like that.

37
00:04:05,081 --> 00:04:08,244
Off to bed, sleepyhead!

38
00:04:08,451 --> 00:04:10,419
Why hasn't Odile
put them to bed?

39
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:13,953
Because <i>monsieur</i>
let her go off to the movies

40
00:04:14,157 --> 00:04:17,183
for the third time this week.

41
00:04:17,394 --> 00:04:20,727
"The third time this week."
Of course I did.

42
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:24,195
They're showing <i>Johnny Guitar.</i>
Good for her education.

43
00:04:24,401 --> 00:04:26,369
There are
too many idiots around.

44
00:04:26,569 --> 00:04:31,063
Hurry up. Frank and Paola
will be here any minute.

45
00:04:31,274 --> 00:04:34,038
I'm not going.
I'm staying home with the kids.

46
00:04:34,244 --> 00:04:37,407
No! Frank's bringing his niece.

47
00:04:37,614 --> 00:04:40,515
She can baby-sit
till we get back.

48
00:04:40,784 --> 00:04:43,275
She's a student.
She does it all the time.

49
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:47,520
His niece?
Knowing him, it's a call girl.

50
00:04:47,724 --> 00:04:49,191
I'm not going.

51
00:04:50,126 --> 00:04:52,458
You'll do as you're told.

52
00:04:52,662 --> 00:04:57,224
Papa will introduce you
to the managing director of Standard Oil.

53
00:04:57,434 --> 00:05:00,426
And I'll sue the TV people
for firing me.

54
00:05:00,637 --> 00:05:03,936
No, you won't.
You'd only lose.

55
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:08,338
And when someone finds you work,
you'll be good enough to take it.

56
00:05:08,545 --> 00:05:10,604
That's enough now.
Come on.

57
00:05:15,685 --> 00:05:17,812
You're not wearing a slip?

58
00:05:18,088 --> 00:05:22,752
No, I'm wearing my new
"Scandale" girdle. It's invisible.

59
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:27,555
"I've got that young look
with my 'Scandale' girdle!"

60
00:05:28,198 --> 00:05:30,393
<i>First there was Greek civilization.</i>

61
00:05:31,201 --> 00:05:32,793
<i>Then there was the Renaissance.</i>

62
00:05:32,936 --> 00:05:35,803
<i>Now we're entering</i>
<i>the Age of the Ass.</i>

63
00:05:36,573 --> 00:05:38,097
I'll show you around.

64
00:05:38,308 --> 00:05:39,798
She loves children.

65
00:05:40,143 --> 00:05:43,601
You can reach us at -
What's the number?

66
00:05:43,813 --> 00:05:45,781
225-70-01.

67
00:05:45,982 --> 00:05:48,644
- This is Frank's niece.
- Oh?

68
00:05:50,653 --> 00:05:52,211
Good evening.

69
00:05:55,658 --> 00:05:56,647
Hi.

70
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:00,455
Can't you say "BALzac 70-01"?
You don't know Balzac?

71
00:06:00,663 --> 00:06:05,191
Read <i>César Birotteau,</i> how the Fifth
Symphony pounded in his poor head.

72
00:06:05,401 --> 00:06:08,632
- What's eating you?
- Let's go, daddy-o.

73
00:06:08,838 --> 00:06:10,100
<i>Chapter Two.</i>

74
00:06:10,306 --> 00:06:14,174
<i>Surprise party at the home of</i>
<i>my wife's parents, Mr. And Mrs. Expresso.</i>

75
00:06:14,377 --> 00:06:17,073
<i>The Alfa Romeo</i>
<i>has great acceleration,</i>

76
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,840
powerful four-wheel
disc brakes,

77
00:06:20,049 --> 00:06:23,018
a luxurious interior,
and great traction.

78
00:06:23,219 --> 00:06:25,414
It's an exceptional touring car.

79
00:06:25,622 --> 00:06:28,557
It's safe, fast
and a pleasure to drive,

80
00:06:28,758 --> 00:06:31,226
with great response
and perfect balance.

81
00:06:32,829 --> 00:06:34,660
It's easy to stay fresh.

82
00:06:34,864 --> 00:06:38,095
Soap washes, cologne refreshes,
perfume perfumes.

83
00:06:38,368 --> 00:06:41,166
To combat underarm perspiration,

84
00:06:41,371 --> 00:06:44,807
I use Printil after my bath
for all-day protection.

85
00:06:45,008 --> 00:06:47,636
It comes
in a wonderfully fresh aerosol,

86
00:06:47,844 --> 00:06:50,438
as well as stick and roll-on.

87
00:06:51,281 --> 00:06:54,409
But the Oldsmobile Rocket 88
has even more to offer.

88
00:06:54,617 --> 00:06:57,677
Its meticulous design,

89
00:06:57,887 --> 00:07:00,253
its powerful yet simple lines,

90
00:07:00,456 --> 00:07:02,856
and its uncommon elegance
all prove

91
00:07:03,059 --> 00:07:06,392
that beauty isn't incompatible
with top performance.

92
00:07:08,398 --> 00:07:10,366
You look lonely.

93
00:07:15,471 --> 00:07:18,099
He's American.
He doesn't speak French.

94
00:07:19,609 --> 00:07:21,941
What's his name?
What's he do?

95
00:07:39,229 --> 00:07:41,026
Baudelaire. Very good.

96
00:07:44,567 --> 00:07:48,799
I've always wanted to know
exactly what cinema is.

97
00:08:26,609 --> 00:08:27,667
<i>My hairdo</i>

98
00:08:27,877 --> 00:08:32,280
stayed light and soft all day
thanks to Elnett Satin Spray.

99
00:08:33,683 --> 00:08:38,484
And now the spray brushes out
effortlessly, like it was never there.

100
00:08:39,489 --> 00:08:40,854
Soft.

101
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:47,796
My hair is like
strands of golden silk...

102
00:08:49,198 --> 00:08:50,631
shining...

103
00:08:51,701 --> 00:08:53,191
and clean.

104
00:08:53,403 --> 00:08:55,769
<i>Women must give up</i>

105
00:08:55,972 --> 00:08:59,430
filmy negligees
and romantic nightgowns.

106
00:09:00,977 --> 00:09:06,313
Outdoors or in bright light, lingerie
loses its allure and becomes indecent.

107
00:09:12,689 --> 00:09:14,782
Olympio's melancholy.

108
00:09:19,495 --> 00:09:21,292
Give me the keys
to the Lincoln.

109
00:09:21,564 --> 00:09:23,122
You're not staying?

110
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:25,162
No, I'm tired.

111
00:09:26,636 --> 00:09:29,901
I've got a mechanism
for seeing called eyes,

112
00:09:30,707 --> 00:09:33,005
for hearing called ears,

113
00:09:33,209 --> 00:09:35,200
for speaking
called a mouth.

114
00:09:36,079 --> 00:09:38,843
But they feel disconnected.

115
00:09:39,048 --> 00:09:40,879
They don't work together.

116
00:09:41,651 --> 00:09:44,484
A person should feel
like he's one individual.

117
00:09:44,921 --> 00:09:47,651
I feel like
I'm many different people.

118
00:09:49,292 --> 00:09:53,558
You talk too much.
It tires me out just listening to you.

119
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:56,162
You're right.
I talk too much.

120
00:09:56,366 --> 00:09:58,994
A man alone
always talks too much.

121
00:10:01,904 --> 00:10:03,667
I'll wait for you at home.

122
00:10:08,211 --> 00:10:10,372
<i>Next chapter:</i>

<i>Marianne Renoir.</i>

128
00:10:29,565 --> 00:10:31,157
You're still here?

129
00:10:41,711 --> 00:10:42,939
Sorry.

130
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:46,374
You missed the last train.
How will you get home?

131
00:10:46,582 --> 00:10:47,913
I don't know.

132
00:10:49,986 --> 00:10:51,578
You're all alone?

133
00:10:52,155 --> 00:10:54,521
I was bored, so I came home.

134
00:10:55,691 --> 00:10:58,524
Anything wrong?
You look depressed.

135
00:10:59,362 --> 00:11:03,731
Some days are like that.
Everyone you meet is an imbecile.

136
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:07,200
So you start
looking in the mirror

137
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:10,029
and wondering about yourself.

138
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,774
Come on.
I'll take you home.

139
00:11:25,354 --> 00:11:26,981
<i>Frank lent you his car?</i>

140
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:30,557
Yeah. Why?
Don't you like American cars?

141
00:11:30,827 --> 00:11:32,385
Sure.

142
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:36,922
Funny, our meeting
again like this.

143
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:41,793
- It's been four years.
- No, 51/2.

144
00:11:42,205 --> 00:11:43,934
It was in October.

145
00:11:44,807 --> 00:11:46,502
You're married now?

146
00:11:46,709 --> 00:11:50,577
Yes, to an Italian with money.
But she doesn't really interest me.

147
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:55,149
- Why don't you divorce?
- I wanted to, but I've grown too lazy.

148
00:11:55,351 --> 00:11:59,014
Like you pointed out once:

149
00:11:59,222 --> 00:12:02,020
To want something,
you have to be alive.

150
00:12:02,325 --> 00:12:05,055
Do you still teach Spanish?

151
00:12:05,261 --> 00:12:09,129
No, I was in television,
but I gave it up.

152
00:12:10,533 --> 00:12:13,434
What about you?
- Oh, nothing special.

153
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:16,868
You don't feel
like talking about yourself.

154
00:12:17,073 --> 00:12:19,871
A friend of mine saw you
in London two years ago.

155
00:12:20,076 --> 00:12:22,135
Are you still
with that American?

156
00:12:22,411 --> 00:12:24,538
No, that ended a long time ago.

157
00:12:24,747 --> 00:12:27,739
Have you known Frank long?

158
00:12:28,384 --> 00:12:31,319
Not really. Just casually.

159
00:12:31,654 --> 00:12:33,747
Mysterious as ever, I see.

160
00:12:34,357 --> 00:12:37,918
Like I said, I just don't like
talking about myself.

161
00:12:38,127 --> 00:12:40,687
Very well. Silence, then.

162
00:12:48,704 --> 00:12:52,003
<i>... a garrison massacred</i>
<i>by the Viet Cong,</i>

163
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:54,301
<i>who also lost 115 men.</i>

164
00:12:55,611 --> 00:12:58,045
Awful, isn't it?
It's so anonymous.

165
00:12:58,314 --> 00:12:59,474
What is?

166
00:12:59,749 --> 00:13:03,879
They say "115 guerrillas,"
and it means nothing to us.

167
00:13:04,153 --> 00:13:08,954
But each one is a man,
and we don't even know who he is,

168
00:13:09,158 --> 00:13:11,388
if he loves a woman,
if he has kids,

169
00:13:11,594 --> 00:13:14,620
if he prefers movies or plays.

170
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:19,267
We know nothing about them.
All they say is "115 killed."

171
00:13:20,303 --> 00:13:23,966
It's like photographs.
They've always fascinated me.

172
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:29,209
You see this frozen image of a guy
with a caption underneath.

173
00:13:29,478 --> 00:13:32,038
Maybe he was a coward.
Maybe he was a nice guy.

174
00:13:32,248 --> 00:13:34,580
But at the moment it was taken,

175
00:13:34,784 --> 00:13:39,118
no one can really say who he was,
what he was thinking about.

176
00:13:39,488 --> 00:13:42,082
His wife? His mistress?

177
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:45,021
The past? The future?
Basketball?

178
00:13:45,394 --> 00:13:47,385
No one will ever know.

179
00:13:49,098 --> 00:13:51,191
That's life for you.

180
00:13:51,467 --> 00:13:55,836
That's what makes me sad:
Life is so different from books.

181
00:13:56,606 --> 00:13:59,131
I wish it were the same:

182
00:13:59,809 --> 00:14:03,870
Clear, logical, organized.

183
00:14:04,814 --> 00:14:06,645
Only it isn't.

184
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:10,977
Yes, it is.
Much more than people think.

185
00:14:11,187 --> 00:14:12,950
No, Pierrot.

186
00:14:13,956 --> 00:14:16,481
For the last time,
my name's Ferdinand.

187
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:20,690
I know, but you can't sing
<i>My friend Ferdinand</i>

188
00:14:21,264 --> 00:14:25,030
Yes, you can.
You just have to want to, Marianne.

189
00:14:26,335 --> 00:14:27,962
I want to.

190
00:14:29,038 --> 00:14:31,438
I'll do anything you want.

191
00:14:33,242 --> 00:14:35,233
Me too, Marianne.

192
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,674
I'm putting my hand
on your knee.

193
00:14:42,018 --> 00:14:43,815
Me too, Marianne.

194
00:14:47,123 --> 00:14:49,387
I'm kissing you all over.

195
00:14:51,494 --> 00:14:53,291
Me too, Marianne.

196
00:14:58,301 --> 00:15:01,395
<i>You're so beautiful, my pet</i>

197
00:15:05,808 --> 00:15:07,332
We'll see.

198
00:15:07,777 --> 00:15:10,302
<i>Marianne Renoir.</i>

199
00:15:25,661 --> 00:15:27,891
On your feet, dead man!

200
00:16:07,002 --> 00:16:09,300
- You see? I was right.
- About what?

201
00:16:09,505 --> 00:16:11,905
You didn't believe
we'd always be in love.

202
00:16:12,108 --> 00:16:16,408
No, I never told you
I'd love you forever.

203
00:16:16,712 --> 00:16:18,509
<i>Oh, my love</i>

204
00:16:19,582 --> 00:16:24,485
<i>You never promised</i>
<i>to adore me all your life</i>

205
00:16:26,155 --> 00:16:29,283
<i>We never exchanged</i>
<i>such promises</i>

206
00:16:29,492 --> 00:16:32,893
<i>Knowing me</i>
<i>knowing you</i>

207
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:37,959
<i>We never thought</i>
<i>we'd be caught in love's web</i>

208
00:16:38,267 --> 00:16:41,168
<i>Fickle as we were</i>

209
00:16:42,037 --> 00:16:47,566
<i>But gradually</i>
<i>without a word between us</i>

210
00:16:47,777 --> 00:16:49,711
<i>Bit by bit</i>

211
00:16:51,714 --> 00:16:57,243
<i>Feelings arose between</i>
<i>our bodies mingled in delight</i>

212
00:16:59,255 --> 00:17:02,816
<i>Then words of love rose</i>
<i>to our naked lips</i>

213
00:17:03,025 --> 00:17:04,925
<i>Bit by bit</i>

214
00:17:07,062 --> 00:17:11,328
<i>Heaps of words of love</i>
<i>mingled gently with our kisses</i>

215
00:17:11,534 --> 00:17:13,764
<i>So many words of love</i>

216
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:21,969
<i>I never thought</i>
<i>I'd always want you</i>

217
00:17:22,178 --> 00:17:24,146
<i>Oh, my love</i>

218
00:17:24,847 --> 00:17:28,248
<i>We never thought</i>
<i>we could live together</i>

219
00:17:28,451 --> 00:17:30,442
<i>And not grow tired</i>
<i>of each other</i>

220
00:17:31,253 --> 00:17:33,380
<i>To wake up every morning</i>

221
00:17:33,589 --> 00:17:38,686
<i>Surprised to still be</i>
<i>so happy in the same bed</i>

222
00:17:39,995 --> 00:17:43,954
<i>And want nothing more</i>
<i>than that ordinary pleasure</i>

223
00:17:44,266 --> 00:17:47,360
<i>Of feeling so at ease</i>
<i>with each other</i>

224
00:18:02,651 --> 00:18:08,385
<i>But gradually</i>
<i>without a word between us</i>

225
00:18:08,591 --> 00:18:10,525
<i>Bit by bit</i>

226
00:18:12,628 --> 00:18:18,430
<i>Our feelings bound us tight</i>
<i>in spite of ourselves, never to let go</i>

227
00:18:20,769 --> 00:18:24,705
<i>Feelings stronger</i>
<i>than any words of love</i>

228
00:18:24,907 --> 00:18:26,807
<i>Known or unknown</i>

229
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:29,840
<i>Feelings so wild and strong</i>

230
00:18:30,045 --> 00:18:34,243
<i>That we never thought</i>
<i>were possible before</i>

231
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:39,581
<i>Don't ever promise</i>
<i>to adore me all your life</i>

232
00:18:40,523 --> 00:18:43,321
<i>Let's never exchange</i>
<i>such promises</i>

233
00:18:43,526 --> 00:18:46,689
<i>Knowing me</i>
<i>knowing you</i>

234
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:52,790
<i>Let's keep the feeling</i>
<i>that this love of ours</i>

235
00:18:53,002 --> 00:18:57,166
<i>Is a love with no tomorrow</i>

236
00:18:57,473 --> 00:19:02,604
Well, in 60 years, when we're dead,
we'll know if we were always in love.

237
00:19:02,811 --> 00:19:05,109
No, I know I love you,

238
00:19:05,314 --> 00:19:08,511
but I'm not so sure about you.

239
00:19:08,717 --> 00:19:10,981
I do, Marianne.

240
00:19:11,086 --> 00:19:13,111
Well, we'll see.

241
00:19:16,191 --> 00:19:18,250
<i>Your wife was here this morning.</i>

242
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:20,291
<i>I don't give a damn.</i>

243
00:19:20,496 --> 00:19:21,622
<i>That's not all.</i>

244
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:24,458
<i>I said I don't give a damn.</i>

245
00:19:24,667 --> 00:19:26,498
<i>- Marianne tells</i>
<i>- Ferdinand</i>

246
00:19:26,702 --> 00:19:27,600
<i>- a story</i>
<i>- all mixed up</i>

247
00:19:27,803 --> 00:19:30,567
<i>- I knew some people</i>
<i>- like in the Algerian war</i>

248
00:19:30,773 --> 00:19:32,001
<i>I'll explain everything</i>

249
00:19:32,207 --> 00:19:34,038
<i>wake from a bad dream</i>

250
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:27,192
<i>- Frank had the keys?</i>
<i>- I'll explain everything.</i>

251
00:20:27,396 --> 00:20:29,694
<i>- Were you in love with him?</i>
<i>- I'll explain everything.</i>

252
00:20:29,898 --> 00:20:32,332
<i>- Did he kiss you?</i>
<i>- I'll explain everything.</i>

253
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:26,912
<i>- A story</i>
<i>- all mixed up</i>

254
00:21:27,222 --> 00:21:29,452
<i>- leave in a hurry</i>
<i>- wake from a bad dream</i>

255
00:21:29,725 --> 00:21:31,522
<i>- I knew some people</i>
<i>- politics</i>

256
00:21:31,827 --> 00:21:33,351
<i>- an organization</i>
<i>- get away</i>

257
00:21:33,629 --> 00:21:35,290
<i>gun-running</i>

258
00:21:36,498 --> 00:21:38,830
<i>in silence... in silence</i>

259
00:21:41,203 --> 00:21:42,534
<i>in silence</i>

260
00:21:55,918 --> 00:21:58,045
<i>- It's me... Marianne.</i>
<i>- Did he kiss you?</i>

261
00:21:58,353 --> 00:21:59,752
<i>- A story</i>
<i>- all mixed up</i>

262
00:21:59,955 --> 00:22:02,389
<i>- I knew some people</i>
<i>- were you in love with him?</i>

263
00:22:02,591 --> 00:22:05,583
<i>- Use my apartment</i>
<i>- like in the Algerian war</i>

264
00:22:05,794 --> 00:22:07,261
<i>- my brother</i>
<i>- wake from a bad dream</i>

265
00:22:07,463 --> 00:22:10,796
<i>leave in a hurry... leave in a hurry</i>

266
00:22:10,999 --> 00:22:11,931
<i>- answer</i>
<i>- clobber him</i>

267
00:22:12,134 --> 00:22:13,226
<i>- argument</i>
<i>- garage</i>

268
00:22:13,435 --> 00:22:14,629
<i>- who is it?</i>
<i>- Down south</i>

269
00:22:14,837 --> 00:22:16,270
<i>- get away</i>
<i>- no money</i>

270
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,873
<i>It was time to leave</i>
<i>that rotten world anyway.</i>

271
00:22:21,076 --> 00:22:23,909
<i>We left Paris</i>
<i>on a one-way street.</i>

272
00:22:24,113 --> 00:22:25,842
<i>Recognizing two of her own,</i>

273
00:22:25,948 --> 00:22:28,246
<i>the Statue of Liberty</i>
<i>gave us a friendly wave.</i>

274
00:22:35,424 --> 00:22:38,484
- Put a tiger in my tank.
- We don't sell tigers.

275
00:22:38,694 --> 00:22:41,663
Then just shut up
and fill 'er up, pal.

276
00:22:59,114 --> 00:23:01,082
I'll look less suspicious.

277
00:23:12,628 --> 00:23:14,687
That'll be 4,900 francs.

278
00:23:15,497 --> 00:23:17,294
Check the water and oil, pal.

279
00:23:27,142 --> 00:23:29,076
Help me, dope!

280
00:23:36,518 --> 00:23:37,951
Shit! Another one!

281
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:42,680
I know a trick from Laurel and Hardy.
Get in the car.

282
00:23:42,891 --> 00:23:46,122
- Shame on you! Don't you have money?
- No, sir.

283
00:23:46,328 --> 00:23:48,888
Then get a job.
Or don't you want to work?

284
00:23:49,097 --> 00:23:52,260
- No, sir, we don't.
- Then how will you pay?

285
00:23:56,171 --> 00:23:58,833
Shit! There's one more left.
I'll handle him.

286
00:24:17,092 --> 00:24:18,719
I'm calling the police!

287
00:24:22,164 --> 00:24:24,155
<i>- Sum total</i>
<i>- it was an adventure film</i>

288
00:24:24,433 --> 00:24:25,798
The Crown of Blood

289
00:24:26,001 --> 00:24:27,559
<i>- Sum total</i>
- Tender is the Night

290
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:29,531
<i>It was a love story.</i>

291
00:24:29,738 --> 00:24:31,296
<i>It was a love story.</i>

292
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:34,131
- Tender is the Night
<i>- It was a love story.</i>

293
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:38,311
We'll find my brother eventually.

294
00:24:45,787 --> 00:24:48,483
Just what kind
of smuggling is he in?

295
00:24:48,924 --> 00:24:51,188
Oh, some stuff in Africa.

296
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,155
Angola, the Congo.

297
00:24:54,796 --> 00:24:57,492
I thought he did TV shows
in Monte Carlo.

298
00:24:57,699 --> 00:24:59,530
Yeah, that too.

299
00:25:03,572 --> 00:25:06,837
We've got to decide
where we're going.

300
00:25:08,076 --> 00:25:12,376
We talked about Nice,
then maybe Italy.

301
00:25:12,781 --> 00:25:17,878
Our money won't get us to Nice.
We'd better dump the Peugeot.

302
00:25:20,956 --> 00:25:23,390
Have you ever
killed a man, Pierrot?

303
00:25:23,592 --> 00:25:27,050
My name's Ferdinand.
Why do you ask?

304
00:25:29,298 --> 00:25:32,233
Because it's going
to turn your stomach.

305
00:25:34,236 --> 00:25:36,602
I wonder
what she told the cops.

306
00:25:38,206 --> 00:25:42,006
Maybe they haven't questioned her yet.
- Don't kid yourself.

307
00:25:42,277 --> 00:25:45,246
She told them
every nasty thing she could.

308
00:25:45,614 --> 00:25:47,605
With good reason.

309
00:25:47,816 --> 00:25:51,183
Anyway, I feel sorry for her.
- Sorry?

310
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:54,682
Guys like you are always sorry...

311
00:25:55,757 --> 00:25:57,748
but always too late.

312
00:26:17,479 --> 00:26:20,539
- What are you doing?
- Looking at myself.

313
00:26:20,749 --> 00:26:22,410
What do you see?

314
00:26:22,617 --> 00:26:26,417
A man about to drive
over a cliff at 60 mph.

315
00:26:29,091 --> 00:26:31,059
I see a woman

316
00:26:31,259 --> 00:26:35,491
in love with the man
about to drive over a cliff at 60 mph.

317
00:26:35,764 --> 00:26:37,732
Then let's have a kiss.

318
00:26:46,808 --> 00:26:49,800
<i>The next day</i>

319
00:26:50,012 --> 00:26:51,343
RENDEZVOUS WITH DEATH

320
00:26:51,546 --> 00:26:55,277
<i>- we find the Peugeot</i>
<i>- entering a town in central France</i>

321
00:26:55,484 --> 00:26:57,577
<i>- with its tank</i>
<i>- almost empty.</i>

322
00:26:57,786 --> 00:26:58,946
<i>- Marianne</i>
<i>- and Ferdinand</i>

323
00:26:59,154 --> 00:27:01,714
<i>- stop at a bar</i>
<i>- and order drinks</i>

324
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:03,651
<i>- wondering</i>
<i>- how to pay for them.</i>

325
00:27:03,859 --> 00:27:08,626
<i>- Their descriptions are on the radio.</i>
<i>- People eye them warily.</i>

326
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:12,994
<i>- Their descrip... descrip...</i>
<i>- People eye them... eye them warily.</i>

327
00:27:13,201 --> 00:27:14,532
<i>The people are:</i>

328
00:27:14,736 --> 00:27:16,966
Laszlo Kovacs, student,

329
00:27:17,172 --> 00:27:22,166
born on January 25, 1936,

330
00:27:22,377 --> 00:27:24,004
in Santo Domingo.

331
00:27:24,212 --> 00:27:26,703
Forced to flee
the American invasion.

332
00:27:26,915 --> 00:27:31,079
Now living in France
as a political refugee.

333
00:27:31,286 --> 00:27:35,950
France... the land of liberty,
equality and brotherhood.

334
00:27:36,158 --> 00:27:39,787
Viviane Blassel,
born on March 21, 1943, in Marseilles.

335
00:27:40,162 --> 00:27:44,724
I'm 22. I work at the perfume counter
at a department store in Auxerre.

336
00:27:44,933 --> 00:27:50,701
Eté, André, born on May 25, 1903,
in Marbouie, Eure-et-Loir.

337
00:27:50,906 --> 00:27:52,464
Age: 62.

338
00:27:52,674 --> 00:27:55,472
Present occupation: Film extra.

339
00:27:55,777 --> 00:27:58,712
<i>Let's tell stories.</i>
<i>The right words may move them.</i>

340
00:27:58,914 --> 00:28:01,041
<i>- About what?</i>
<i>- Anything at all.</i>

341
00:28:01,249 --> 00:28:05,686
<i>The fall of Constantinople,</i>
<i>or Nicolas de Staël committing suicide.</i>

342
00:28:05,954 --> 00:28:07,683
<i>Or William Wilson,</i>

343
00:28:07,889 --> 00:28:11,518
<i>who saw his double in the street</i>
<i>and couldn't rest till he'd killed him.</i>

344
00:28:11,726 --> 00:28:15,218
<i>When it was done,</i>
<i>he realized he'd killed himself,</i>

345
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:17,557
<i>while his double went on living.</i>

346
00:28:17,766 --> 00:28:20,360
<i>Okay. Maybe they'll give us</i>
<i>some money.</i>

347
00:28:20,569 --> 00:28:23,697
<i>Marianne, who had the eyes</i>
<i>of both Aucassin and Nicolette,</i>

348
00:28:23,905 --> 00:28:27,568
<i>told them about William of Orange's</i>
<i>nephew, the handsome Vivien,</i>

349
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:31,177
<i>who died fighting</i>
<i>30,000 Saracens.</i>

350
00:28:31,379 --> 00:28:33,142
<i>Bleeding from</i>
<i>a thousand wounds,</i>

351
00:28:33,348 --> 00:28:36,317
<i>he fought on alone,</i>
<i>for he swore not to retreat.</i>

352
00:28:36,518 --> 00:28:41,148
<i>Oh, young and gentle nephew,</i>
<i>why this vow so noble yet so mad?</i>

353
00:28:41,356 --> 00:28:44,689
<i>Ferdinand started</i>
<i>telling them about Guynemer,</i>

354
00:28:44,893 --> 00:28:46,656
<i>but they weren't listening,</i>

355
00:28:46,862 --> 00:28:49,626
<i>so he spoke of the summer,</i>

356
00:28:49,831 --> 00:28:53,665
<i>and of how lovers long</i>
<i>for the warm evening air.</i>

357
00:28:53,869 --> 00:28:57,862
<i>He spoke of man, and the seasons,</i>
<i>and unexpected encounters.</i>

358
00:28:58,773 --> 00:29:04,040
<i>But he told them never to ask</i>
<i>which came first, words or things,</i>

359
00:29:04,246 --> 00:29:06,476
<i>or what would come next.</i>

360
00:29:06,681 --> 00:29:09,809
<i>I feel alive,</i>
<i>and that's all that matters.</i>

361
00:29:33,708 --> 00:29:35,232
I've got an idea.

362
00:29:37,712 --> 00:29:40,704
We'll fake an accident.

363
00:29:52,627 --> 00:29:56,586
The police will think we're dead.
Okay, Pierrot?

364
00:29:56,798 --> 00:29:59,392
My name's Ferdinand.

365
00:29:59,601 --> 00:30:04,095
All we have to do is burn the car.
They'll think we died in the fire.

366
00:30:04,306 --> 00:30:09,334
- Always fire, blood and war!
- Hey, it wasn't my idea! Move it closer.

367
00:30:09,711 --> 00:30:12,509
It's gotta look real.
This isn't a movie.

368
00:30:14,516 --> 00:30:17,644
Closer! Hurry up!

369
00:30:23,592 --> 00:30:27,653
- No matches. Let's go.
- That's okay. Give me the gun.

370
00:30:30,832 --> 00:30:35,269
- The same make that killed Kennedy.
- Didn't you know that was me?

371
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:37,768
Out of the way.
- Wait a minute.

372
00:30:38,406 --> 00:30:40,033
Nice little fire.

373
00:30:41,276 --> 00:30:43,506
- Know what was in that suitcase?
- No. What?

374
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:46,579
The dollars you were looking for
in the apartment.

375
00:30:46,781 --> 00:30:49,375
Bastard!
You did that on purpose.

376
00:30:49,584 --> 00:30:50,881
That's right.

377
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:54,386
You know what we could've done
with that money?

378
00:30:54,656 --> 00:30:59,093
We could've gone to Chicago,
Las Vegas, Monte Carlo. You bastard!

379
00:30:59,361 --> 00:31:01,727
I'd have gone to Florence,
Venice and Athens.

380
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:04,330
Let's go.
Travel broadens the mind.

381
00:32:00,555 --> 00:32:03,353
<i>- Chapter Eight.</i>
- A Season in Hell.

382
00:32:03,558 --> 00:32:06,356
<i>- Chapter Eight.</i>
<i>- We crossed France</i>

383
00:32:06,561 --> 00:32:08,222
<i>- like shadows</i>
<i>- like a mirror</i>

384
00:34:15,390 --> 00:34:17,620
<i>- like shadows</i>
<i>- like a mirror</i>

385
00:34:17,826 --> 00:34:21,489
<i>I saw the café where Van Gogh</i>
<i>decided to cut off his ear.</i>

386
00:34:21,696 --> 00:34:25,063
<i>- You're a liar. What did you see?</i>
<i>- I saw...</i>

387
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,468
THE NICKEL-FOOTED GANG

388
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:32,939
Look, Pierrot, a Ford Galaxie.

389
00:34:33,141 --> 00:34:36,599
My name's Ferdinand.
Yeah, a '62.

390
00:34:38,146 --> 00:34:41,240
- Show me you're a man.
- Wait till I finish this.

391
00:34:41,449 --> 00:34:45,647
"After covering a good distance,
they came to the Bayorda desert,

392
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:49,048
which they had to cross
to reach Karthoum.

393
00:34:49,357 --> 00:34:52,087
'Darn! Not much shade! '
They grumbled,

394
00:34:52,293 --> 00:34:54,921
as they set out
across the scorching sand.

395
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:59,064
'We'd be better off in the cool shade
of a glass of lager."'

396
00:34:59,267 --> 00:35:02,259
Make up your mind
or I'll hitch a ride alone.

397
00:35:02,604 --> 00:35:05,095
All right.
Let's go, daddy-o.

398
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,025
A lube job, please.

399
00:35:29,364 --> 00:35:31,025
Where are the bathrooms?

400
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,559
Come on, Mimi.

401
00:35:44,012 --> 00:35:46,503
Hey, kid, how'd you like
to own a car like this?

402
00:35:46,714 --> 00:35:49,114
- Sure!
- Well, you never will.

403
00:36:22,951 --> 00:36:25,351
Marianne, his jacket.

404
00:36:28,289 --> 00:36:32,020
Hey, kid, how'd you like
to earn 10,000 francs?

405
00:37:16,704 --> 00:37:18,763
<i>The landscape</i>
<i>rose slowly before us.</i>

406

<i>Countless centuries fled</i>

407

Hey, my book!

Hurry!

410
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:23,197
LIFE

411
00:38:25,373 --> 00:38:27,807
- Well?
- Nothing special.

412
00:38:28,476 --> 00:38:29,966
They questioned her.

413
00:38:30,244 --> 00:38:34,146
She said she saw us
naked together in my bed.

414
00:38:34,482 --> 00:38:36,973
You see?
And you called me a liar.

415
00:38:37,185 --> 00:38:38,447
Nothing else?

416
00:38:38,753 --> 00:38:41,654
You still seem
awfully interested in her.

417
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:43,887
<i>Nothing at all happened.</i>

418

<i>I don't understand.</i>
<i>He's lost his mind.</i>

419
00:38:48,062 --> 00:38:51,964
Ditch a woman and she'll say
you've got a screw loose.

420
00:38:52,166 --> 00:38:54,794
Men are the same way.

421
00:38:56,037 --> 00:38:57,470
True.

422
00:38:57,872 --> 00:39:01,968
I don't know why,
but I'm picking up the scent of death.

423
00:39:02,176 --> 00:39:04,542
If you miss her, just say so!

424
00:39:04,746 --> 00:39:06,805
Cut it out!
You're getting on my nerves!

425
00:39:07,014 --> 00:39:09,608
I mean the scent of death
in the countryside, trees,

426
00:39:09,917 --> 00:39:11,680
women's faces, cars.

427
00:39:11,986 --> 00:39:16,980
We'll be in a hell of a fix without money.
We can't even get to Italy.

428
00:39:17,191 --> 00:39:18,886
We'll just stop anywhere.

429
00:39:23,865 --> 00:39:25,833
We'll just stop anywhere.

430
00:39:26,033 --> 00:39:28,160
And do what all day?

431
00:39:28,369 --> 00:39:32,237
No, let's find my brother.
He'll give us tons of dough.

432
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:38,174
Then we'll find ourselves
a high-class hotel and have some fun!

433
00:39:38,379 --> 00:39:41,246
- All she thinks about is fun.
- Who are you talking to?

434
00:39:41,449 --> 00:39:43,076
The audience.

435
00:39:44,218 --> 00:39:47,619
I told you so.
You're already sorry.

436
00:39:47,889 --> 00:39:51,052
You were crazy to do this.
- No, I'm in love.

437
00:39:51,325 --> 00:39:53,088
It's the same thing.

438
00:39:54,462 --> 00:39:57,590
I've decided never
to fall in love again.

439
00:39:58,065 --> 00:39:59,930
It's a disgusting habit.

440
00:40:00,134 --> 00:40:01,795
Don't say that.

441
00:40:09,644 --> 00:40:11,134
Don't say that.

442
00:40:11,445 --> 00:40:15,438
Ten minutes ago, I saw only death.
Now it's just the opposite. Look!

443
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:18,244
The sea, the waves, the sky.

444
00:40:19,253 --> 00:40:22,484
Life may be sad,
but it's always beautiful.

445
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:25,591
Suddenly I feel free.
We can do what we want.

446
00:40:25,793 --> 00:40:29,422
Watch:
Right... left... left... right.

447
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:31,129
Look at the fool!

448
00:40:31,399 --> 00:40:35,631
He's driving down a straight line
and has to follow it all the way.

449
00:40:35,937 --> 00:40:37,700
Oh, yeah? Watch this.

450
00:40:49,684 --> 00:40:50,912
<i>Chapter Eight.</i>

451

To Mystery Island,
like Captain Grant's children.

- To do what?
- Nothing. Just exist.

00:41:37,198 --> 00:41:40,395
- Doesn't sound like much fun.
- That's life.

462
00:41:42,803 --> 00:41:43,963
<i>Not at all.</i>

463
00:41:45,973 --> 00:41:48,373
<i>It's a good thing</i>
<i>I don't like spinach,</i>

464
00:41:48,643 --> 00:41:50,668
<i>because if I did, I'd eat it,</i>

465
00:41:50,945 --> 00:41:53,277
<i>and I can't stand the stuff.</i>

466
00:41:53,547 --> 00:41:55,606
<i>It's the same with you,</i>

467
00:41:55,816 --> 00:41:58,011
<i>only just the opposite.</i>

468
00:41:59,587 --> 00:42:03,887
<i>There was a film like that with</i>
<i>Michel Simon, where he fell for this girl-</i>

469
00:42:04,158 --> 00:42:08,424
<i>- Well, you wanted to start life over.</i>
<i>- I wasn't being mean.</i>

470
00:42:08,629 --> 00:42:10,790

<i>Yes, the end of the night.</i>

472
00:42:31,419 --> 00:42:33,910
Great view of the moon.

473
00:42:36,524 --> 00:42:39,516
- Doesn't look too special to me.
- To me it does.

474
00:42:39,727 --> 00:42:41,388
I see a man up there.

475
00:42:41,929 --> 00:42:46,093
Maybe Leonov,
or that American... White.

476
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:48,291
Yeah, I see him too.

477
00:42:48,569 --> 00:42:52,266
But he's not a Russki
or a nephew of Uncle Sam.

478
00:42:52,506 --> 00:42:54,269
I'll tell you who he is.
- Who?

479
00:42:54,542 --> 00:42:56,772
The moon's only inhabitant.

480
00:42:57,044 --> 00:43:01,003
You know what he's doing?
Getting the hell out.

481
00:43:01,215 --> 00:43:02,648
Why?

482
00:43:02,850 --> 00:43:04,249
- Look.
- Why?

483
00:43:04,585 --> 00:43:08,248
He's fed up.
He was glad to see Leonov land.

484
00:43:08,522 --> 00:43:13,255
Someone to talk to
after an eternity alone!

485
00:43:13,561 --> 00:43:17,429
But Leonov tried to stuff
his head full of Lenin.

486
00:43:17,698 --> 00:43:21,498
So when the American landed,
the guy fled to his camp.

487
00:43:21,769 --> 00:43:25,569
But the American right away
crammed a Coke down his throat

488
00:43:25,906 --> 00:43:29,205
after making him say thank you first,
so now he's really had it.

489
00:43:29,410 --> 00:43:33,039
He's letting the Americans and Russians
shoot it out. He's taking off.

490
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:35,681
- For where?
- Here.

491
00:43:35,883 --> 00:43:38,147
Because he thinks you're lovely.

492
00:43:39,153 --> 00:43:41,144
He admires you.

493
00:43:47,628 --> 00:43:53,430
I think your legs and breasts
are very moving.

494
00:43:57,238 --> 00:43:59,069
Fuck me.

All right.

I've got an idea for a novel:

591
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:02,889
Not to write
about people's lives anymore,

592
00:52:03,190 --> 00:52:08,287
but only about life - life itself.

593
00:52:09,029 --> 00:52:11,088
What lies in between people:

594
00:52:11,298 --> 00:52:16,565
Space, sound, and color.

595
00:52:17,404 --> 00:52:20,100
I'd like to accomplish that.

596
00:52:21,341 --> 00:52:24,105
Joyce gave it a try,

597
00:52:24,411 --> 00:52:29,110
but it should be possible
to do better.

I said five.

601
00:52:37,591 --> 00:52:41,118

Look.

602
00:52:41,328 --> 00:52:45,458
I said one record for every 50 books.
Music after literature!

603

609
00:53:09,389 --> 00:53:12,654
I'm sick of the sea,
the sun, the sand!

610

Sick of eating

If you want to get out of here,
we'll need money.

621
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:55,364
Lots of tourists
come over on the boat.

622
00:53:55,736 --> 00:53:57,727
We can steal from them.

623
00:53:57,938 --> 00:53:59,405
Come on, Pierrot.

624
00:53:59,606 --> 00:54:01,574
My name's Ferdinand.

625
00:54:02,876 --> 00:54:06,175
Come on. We've played
Jules Verne long enough.

626
00:54:06,446 --> 00:54:09,540
Let's go back
to our detective novel,

627
00:54:09,816 --> 00:54:13,411
with fast cars and guns
and nightclubs.

628
00:54:13,687 --> 00:54:15,314
Come on!

629
00:54:15,989 --> 00:54:18,617
Wait for me, Marianne!

630
00:54:21,061 --> 00:54:23,461
Does this brother of yours
really exist?

631
00:54:23,664 --> 00:54:26,724
It's funny how
you never believe me.

632
00:54:36,643 --> 00:54:38,042
Listen...

633
00:54:38,245 --> 00:54:43,649
if we find Fred and he gives us dough,
why don't we go to Miami Beach?

634
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:48,818
Deep down you're a coward.

635
00:54:49,156 --> 00:54:52,648
"Courage consists in remaining
inside oneself, close to nature,

636
00:54:52,859 --> 00:54:54,884
which is oblivious
to our crises."

637
00:54:55,162 --> 00:54:58,290
Will you hurry up?
The tourist boat's gonna leave.

638
00:54:58,498 --> 00:55:00,329
Wait. I've got an idea.

639
00:55:00,901 --> 00:55:02,698
Give me your lipstick.

640
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:13,512
"In the end...

641
00:55:14,481 --> 00:55:19,180
the only thing of any interest

642
00:55:19,486 --> 00:55:23,479
is the paths people take.

643
00:55:24,091 --> 00:55:27,822
The tragic part is that
even when they know

644
00:55:28,128 --> 00:55:32,155
where they're going
and who they are,

645
00:55:32,466 --> 00:55:34,764
everything is still a mystery."

646
00:55:35,102 --> 00:55:37,127
Like the scent of eucalyptus.

647
00:55:37,404 --> 00:55:39,702
- That's right.
- You bet it is.

648
00:55:39,906 --> 00:55:45,742
"And that mystery,
forever unsolved, is life."

649
00:55:46,012 --> 00:55:49,243
- Get a move on, Paul.
- Shut up, Virginia.

650
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:02,758
"We are dead men on parole.
And the trees?"

651
00:56:27,654 --> 00:56:29,986
"To earn a little money,

652
00:56:30,190 --> 00:56:34,752
we drew for the tourists -
modern-day slaves."

653
00:56:46,606 --> 00:56:48,574
Damn! Americans!

654
00:56:48,942 --> 00:56:51,570
It's okay.
We'll change our plan.

655
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:55,573
<i>- It's simple.</i>
<i>- What?</i>

656
00:56:55,782 --> 00:56:58,979
<i>We'll put on a play.</i>
<i>Maybe they'll give us some dollars.</i>

657
00:56:59,252 --> 00:57:02,449
<i>- What play?</i>
<i>- I don't know. Something they'll like.</i>

658
00:57:02,722 --> 00:57:05,555
<i>I've got it.</i>
<i>The Vietnam War.</i>

659
00:58:01,514 --> 00:58:05,473
"Uncle Sam's nephew
versus Uncle Ho's niece."

660
00:58:41,988 --> 00:58:44,149
A little something for the actors.

661
00:58:46,059 --> 00:58:48,527
- A dollar!
- Don't worry, Pierrot.

662
00:58:54,234 --> 00:58:55,792
Long live Kennedy!

663
00:59:02,575 --> 00:59:05,442
I threw them off our trail.
Let's go back.

664
00:59:05,712 --> 00:59:07,771
No, I'm going dancing.

665
00:59:09,382 --> 00:59:11,748
Come on.
You can go tomorrow.

666
00:59:12,052 --> 00:59:15,351
<i>Next chapter: Despair.</i>

667
00:59:15,622 --> 00:59:17,852
- I'm staying here.
- Okay. I'll go alone.

668
00:59:18,058 --> 00:59:19,047
<i>Hope.</i>

669
00:59:19,259 --> 00:59:20,283
You do that.

670
00:59:20,493 --> 00:59:21,687
<i>Remembrance of Things Past.</i>

671
00:59:21,895 --> 00:59:25,490
I heard there's a dance hall
across the water.

672
00:59:25,699 --> 00:59:27,564
I'm going dancing.

673
00:59:28,201 --> 00:59:30,567
If we get killed, too bad.

674
00:59:31,571 --> 00:59:34,267
They'll catch up with us.
So what?

675
00:59:35,608 --> 00:59:37,940
Tuesday I wanted
to buy a record player,

676
00:59:38,144 --> 00:59:41,773
but he spends
all our money on books.

677
00:59:41,982 --> 00:59:44,177
Oh, I don't really give a damn.

678
00:59:44,985 --> 00:59:47,419
But he can't even
understand that.

679
00:59:48,989 --> 00:59:51,423
I don't give a damn
about books

680
00:59:51,624 --> 00:59:55,151
or records or anything -
even money.

681
00:59:55,362 --> 00:59:57,387
I just want to live.

682
00:59:58,565 --> 01:00:00,897
<i>But he'll never understand that.</i>

683
01:00:02,302 --> 01:00:03,769
<i>To live.</i>

684
01:00:20,754 --> 01:00:23,587
<i>My fate line is short as can be</i>

685
01:00:24,791 --> 01:00:29,125
<i>My fate line is short as can be</i>

686
01:00:29,429 --> 01:00:33,593
<i>My palm is such an ill-fated thing</i>

687
01:00:33,867 --> 01:00:38,031
<i>I'm afraid of what tomorrow may bring</i>

688
01:00:38,605 --> 01:00:42,735
<i>My fate line, my fate line</i>

689
01:00:42,942 --> 01:00:46,605
<i>Darling, what do you think</i>
<i>of my fate line</i>

690
01:00:46,913 --> 01:00:50,280
<i>What does it matter</i>
<i>It's fine, just fine</i>

691
01:00:50,550 --> 01:00:54,850
<i>Your thigh line</i>
<i>is more in my line</i>

692
01:00:56,056 --> 01:00:58,115
<i>My fate line</i>

693
01:00:58,391 --> 01:01:01,155
<i>I love to hold it in my lap</i>

694
01:01:01,528 --> 01:01:03,325
<i>Your thigh line</i>

695
01:01:03,596 --> 01:01:05,655
<i>My fate line</i>

696
01:01:06,066 --> 01:01:09,035
<i>It's a feather in my cap</i>

697
01:01:23,450 --> 01:01:28,251
<i>Just look at my little fate line</i>

698
01:01:28,688 --> 01:01:32,647
<i>Just look at my little fate line</i>

699
01:01:33,059 --> 01:01:36,961
<i>Just look at destiny's call</i>

700
01:01:37,297 --> 01:01:41,324
<i>So small it's hardly there at all</i>

701
01:01:41,601 --> 01:01:45,560
<i>My fate line, my fate line</i>

702
01:01:45,839 --> 01:01:49,434
<i>Darling, what do you think</i>
<i>of my fate line</i>

703
01:01:49,709 --> 01:01:53,304
<i>What does it matter</i>
<i>It's fine, just fine</i>

704
01:01:53,646 --> 01:01:56,945
<i>Give me your hand</i>
<i>and don't say a word</i>

705
01:01:57,417 --> 01:02:00,545
<i>Your thigh line</i>
<i>- My fate line</i>

706
01:02:00,954 --> 01:02:03,445
<i>It's like a morning bird</i>

707
01:02:04,390 --> 01:02:07,791
<i>Your thigh line</i>
<i>- My fate line</i>

708
01:02:08,061 --> 01:02:11,360
<i>Frivolous bird, harbinger of fate</i>

709
01:02:32,418 --> 01:02:35,945
<i>Such a tiny little fate line</i>

710
01:02:36,356 --> 01:02:40,315
<i>Such a tiny little fate line</i>

711
01:02:40,627 --> 01:02:44,154
<i>Almost less than nothing</i>

712
01:02:45,098 --> 01:02:49,194
<i>Barely a tiny dot in my hand</i>

713
01:02:49,903 --> 01:02:53,839
<i>My fate line, my fate line</i>

714
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:57,635
<i>Darling, what do you think</i>
<i>of my fate line</i>

715
01:02:57,877 --> 01:03:01,472
<i>What does it matter</i>
<i>It's fine, just fine</i>

716
01:03:01,748 --> 01:03:05,343
<i>Every morning</i>
<i>I'm the happiest man</i>

717
01:03:06,219 --> 01:03:08,687
<i>Your thigh line</i>
<i>- My fate line</i>

718
01:03:08,955 --> 01:03:12,083
<i>A bird is singing in my hand</i>

719
01:03:12,292 --> 01:03:15,693
<i>Your thigh-</i>
<i>- line</i>

720
01:03:15,895 --> 01:03:18,329
<i>- My fate-</i>
<i>- line</i>

721
01:03:21,234 --> 01:03:25,102
Maybe I'm daydreaming.

722
01:03:26,105 --> 01:03:30,405
She makes me think of music.

723
01:03:30,910 --> 01:03:32,571
Her face.

724
01:03:34,214 --> 01:03:35,772
We have come

725
01:03:36,716 --> 01:03:39,947
to the age
of man and his double.

726
01:03:40,687 --> 01:03:45,021
We no longer need mirrors
to talk to ourselves.

727
01:03:50,797 --> 01:03:54,790
When Marianne says,
"It's a fine day,"

728
01:03:55,368 --> 01:03:57,461
what's she thinking about?

729
01:03:57,937 --> 01:04:01,873
All I have is that image of her

730
01:04:02,075 --> 01:04:04,942
saying, "It's a fine day."

731
01:04:05,211 --> 01:04:06,838
Nothing else.

732
01:04:10,984 --> 01:04:14,715
What good is it
figuring all this out?

733
01:04:16,489 --> 01:04:18,923
We are made of dreams,

734
01:04:19,125 --> 01:04:22,856
and dreams are made of us.

735
01:04:24,831 --> 01:04:27,163
It's a fine day, my love,

736
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:31,730
in dreams, in words and in death.

737
01:04:32,138 --> 01:04:35,198
It's a fine day, my love.
It's a fine day

738
01:04:35,275 --> 01:04:36,708
<i>in life.</i>

739
01:05:22,355 --> 01:05:25,415
- You know what I'm thinking?
- I couldn't care less.

740
01:05:26,526 --> 01:05:29,222
Let's not start that again.

741
01:05:29,896 --> 01:05:32,194
I said to leave me alone.

742
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:37,369
Besides, I'm not starting again.
I'm continuing.

743
01:05:44,477 --> 01:05:46,741
- Shit!
- What?

744
01:05:59,025 --> 01:06:01,084
Shit! Shit! Shit!

745
01:06:01,361 --> 01:06:03,158
What's the matter?

746
01:06:06,466 --> 01:06:09,162
Know what you should
write a novel about?

747
01:06:09,369 --> 01:06:11,132
No. What?

748
01:06:12,505 --> 01:06:16,839
This guy's strolling around Paris
when suddenly he sees Death.

749
01:06:17,043 --> 01:06:20,035
So he promptly heads south
to get away,

750
01:06:20,246 --> 01:06:22,714
because he figures
his time hasn't come yet.

751
01:06:22,915 --> 01:06:24,041
And then?

752
01:06:24,250 --> 01:06:26,912
He drives all night at top speed,

753
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:30,180
and the next morning,
when he reaches the coast,

754
01:06:30,857 --> 01:06:34,054
he crashes into a truck
and dies,

755
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:37,727
just when he thought
Death had lost his trail.

756
01:06:56,182 --> 01:06:59,310
- Let's hurry.
- We've got plenty of time.

757
01:06:59,519 --> 01:07:01,384
No, I'm afraid.

758
01:07:16,702 --> 01:07:18,329
You stay here.

759
01:07:22,175 --> 01:07:25,008
- So we meet again.
- What do you want?

760
01:07:27,980 --> 01:07:31,211
- I'll be back in five minutes.
- I'll beat him up if you want.

761
01:07:31,417 --> 01:07:34,545
No, I'll get rid of him
with a few lies.

762
01:07:35,121 --> 01:07:37,180
I have to find Fred, Pierrot.

763
01:07:37,390 --> 01:07:40,223
My name's Ferdinand.
Okay, okay.

764
01:07:58,211 --> 01:08:01,942
"...eroticism, in that sense, betrays...
nostalgia for continuity..."

765
01:08:10,790 --> 01:08:12,917
- Two beers.
- Two?

766
01:08:13,793 --> 01:08:18,162
So when I finish one,
I'll still have one left.

767
01:08:30,076 --> 01:08:31,839
Remember me?

768
01:08:33,312 --> 01:08:36,577
You stayed at my place
in Fontainebleau last year.

769
01:08:37,683 --> 01:08:39,708
I lent you 100,000 francs.

770
01:08:42,221 --> 01:08:45,384
You slept with my wife.
- Oh, right.

771
01:08:45,591 --> 01:08:48,492
- So you've come south?
- Yes, to the coast here.

772
01:08:48,694 --> 01:08:50,685
- Everything okay?
- Fine.

773
01:08:59,972 --> 01:09:01,599
<i>Mr. Griffon?</i>

774
01:09:11,450 --> 01:09:12,781
My name's Ferdinand.
Yes, it's me.

775
01:09:12,985 --> 01:09:14,714
I'm scared.

776
01:09:16,155 --> 01:09:18,180
They're out of their minds.

777
01:09:19,225 --> 01:09:21,159
I swear this isn't a joke.

778
01:09:54,527 --> 01:09:57,826
Tell me where
the money is or else.

779
01:10:01,968 --> 01:10:04,698
We'll give you electric shocks,

780
01:10:05,004 --> 01:10:07,666
like they did during the war.

781
01:10:11,577 --> 01:10:12,874
Or else...

782
01:10:14,246 --> 01:10:16,214
like in Vietnam...

783
01:10:18,317 --> 01:10:20,251
we'll strip you...

784
01:10:21,721 --> 01:10:26,090
put you in a bathtub
full of napalm...

785
01:10:33,065 --> 01:10:34,532
and set it on fire.

786
01:10:38,204 --> 01:10:39,603
<i>No, right now.</i>

787
01:10:39,905 --> 01:10:42,430
<i>You can caress me all over.</i>
<i>I'll be nice again.</i>

788
01:10:44,777 --> 01:10:46,404
Then come quick.

789
01:11:57,216 --> 01:11:58,945
We'll walk up.

790
01:12:37,857 --> 01:12:39,586
A glorious death for a little man.

791
01:13:10,890 --> 01:13:12,619
What are you doing here?

792
01:13:12,825 --> 01:13:15,658
I heard a noise.
I live downstairs.

793
01:13:18,364 --> 01:13:19,854
Let him have it.

794
01:13:39,084 --> 01:13:41,075
We'll use that trick of yours.

795
01:13:44,790 --> 01:13:47,054
You can't fight us, kid.

796
01:13:49,195 --> 01:13:52,164
What'd you do with the money
in the Peugeot?

797
01:13:53,632 --> 01:13:58,399
Take him in the bathroom
and use that trick you learned.

798
01:14:08,380 --> 01:14:10,507
We can't forget about the yacht.

799
01:14:10,716 --> 01:14:12,445
There aren't any towels.

800
01:14:12,651 --> 01:14:15,313
Use that little whore's dress.

801
01:14:19,258 --> 01:14:23,354
Just cover his head
so the water will cut off the air.

802
01:14:24,396 --> 01:14:27,490
I'll make this easy
and tell you what I know.

803
01:14:27,766 --> 01:14:31,429
Then I want a straight answer
to one question.

804
01:14:31,904 --> 01:14:35,305
I know your name
is Ferdinand Griffon.

805
01:14:35,574 --> 01:14:38,839
You were with Marianne
when she stabbed our friend Donovan,

806
01:14:39,178 --> 01:14:41,544
and you ran off with my $50,000.

807
01:14:41,814 --> 01:14:43,645
Ploom ploom tra-la-la.

808
01:14:44,083 --> 01:14:46,643
I've got nothing
against you personally.

809
01:14:46,852 --> 01:14:51,084
I'm sure she dragged you into this.
That's your business.

810
01:14:54,426 --> 01:14:56,053
As I was saying...

811
01:14:58,397 --> 01:15:02,527
I'm not interested in you.
It's her I want.

812
01:15:02,735 --> 01:15:06,034
Now, tell me where to find her
and the money.

813
01:15:06,238 --> 01:15:10,368
This is your last chance.
Tell me or we kill you.

814
01:15:10,776 --> 01:15:12,471
Ploom ploom tra-la-la.

815
01:15:31,797 --> 01:15:33,697
The Marquise dance hall.

816
01:15:33,899 --> 01:15:36,094
Maybe it's true, maybe not,

817
01:15:36,302 --> 01:15:39,066
but this chump's
not gonna say any more.

818
01:15:39,271 --> 01:15:41,068
We'll go have a look.

819
01:15:44,143 --> 01:15:46,077
The Marquise dance hall.

820
01:15:47,012 --> 01:15:48,980
We'll go have a look.

821
01:15:55,287 --> 01:16:00,088
"I've never understood...
Marianne's loyalty."

822
01:16:00,292 --> 01:16:03,193
<i>What a dreadful</i>
<i>5:00 in the afternoon.</i>

823
01:16:13,839 --> 01:16:16,000
<i>I don't want to see blood.</i>

824
01:16:17,609 --> 01:16:20,476
<i>What a dreadful</i>
<i>5:00 in the afternoon.</i>

825
01:16:22,581 --> 01:16:24,776
<i>I don't want to see blood.</i>

826
01:16:28,287 --> 01:16:30,380
<i>I don't want to see blood.</i>

827
01:16:30,589 --> 01:16:33,649
<i>What a dreadful</i>
<i>5:00 in the afternoon.</i>

828
01:17:37,189 --> 01:17:40,488
<i>- Next we find Ferdinand arriving in...</i>
<i>- Toulon.</i>

829
01:17:40,692 --> 01:17:43,752
<i>He wanders along the waterfront.</i>
<i>He's staying...</i>

830
01:17:44,029 --> 01:17:45,496
<i>at the Little Palace Hotel.</i>

831
01:17:45,764 --> 01:17:47,231
<i>- He looks for</i>
<i>- Marianne</i>

832
01:17:47,533 --> 01:17:50,661
<i>but he doesn't find her.</i>
<i>The days go by.</i>

833
01:17:50,936 --> 01:17:54,633
<i>Some afternoons,</i>
<i>he sleeps in all-day movies.</i>

834
01:17:54,907 --> 01:17:56,898
<i>He still keeps a diary.</i>

835
01:17:57,176 --> 01:18:00,339
<i>For words have the power</i>
<i>to disperse the shadows</i>

836
01:18:00,679 --> 01:18:02,943
<i>from around the objects they name.</i>

837
01:18:03,215 --> 01:18:05,206
<i>Even if it's compromised</i>
<i>in everyday life,</i>

838
01:18:05,484 --> 01:18:07,679
<i>language often retains</i>
<i>only what is pure.</i>

839
01:18:11,023 --> 01:18:12,718
"Sea"

840
01:18:14,193 --> 01:18:16,286
"soul"

841
01:18:17,629 --> 01:18:19,460
"bitter"

842
01:18:20,099 --> 01:18:21,794
"weapon"

843
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:27,165
<i>In Vietnam, the Da Nang base,</i>
<i>a major US stronghold,</i>

844
01:18:27,439 --> 01:18:29,134
<i>was attacked by the Viet Cong.</i>

845
01:18:29,441 --> 01:18:32,137
<i>Seven planes were destroyed</i>
<i>on the ground.</i>

846
01:18:32,411 --> 01:18:33,673
<i>In the jungle,</i>

847
01:18:33,879 --> 01:18:37,007
<i>US soldiers fought side by side</i>
<i>for the first time</i>

848
01:18:37,216 --> 01:18:39,207
<i>with South Vietnamese</i>
<i>and Australian forces</i>

849
01:18:39,418 --> 01:18:41,943
<i>against Viet Cong guerilla units.</i>

850
01:18:49,294 --> 01:18:53,731
<i>Despite this escalation, and the failure</i>
<i>of the Commonwealth peace mission,</i>

851
01:18:54,032 --> 01:18:58,196
<i>Harold Wilson stands ready</i>
<i>to participate in negotiations.</i>

852
01:19:09,448 --> 01:19:11,473
<i>Your story ends there.</i>

853
01:19:11,783 --> 01:19:14,377
<i>Yes, he turned away...</i>

854
01:19:15,954 --> 01:19:18,889
<i>leaving me bewildered.</i>

855
01:19:22,661 --> 01:19:25,221
<i>We were looking carefully</i>

856
01:19:25,797 --> 01:19:29,756
<i>for the moment when we had</i>
<i>abandoned the fictional character</i>

857
01:19:29,968 --> 01:19:33,802
<i>to return to the real one,</i>
<i>if it ever existed.</i>

858
01:19:40,779 --> 01:19:43,304
<i>I am Princess Aïcha Abadie,</i>

859
01:19:43,582 --> 01:19:47,518
<i>and despite my fragile,</i>
<i>doll-like appearance,</i>

860
01:19:47,819 --> 01:19:50,515
<i>I am a very</i>
<i>strong-minded woman.</i>

861
01:19:50,722 --> 01:19:54,283
<i>I don't like people getting in my way.</i>
<i>I want to be obeyed.</i>

862
01:19:54,493 --> 01:19:55,460
Your orders, Princess?

863
01:19:55,661 --> 01:19:57,822
I am Lebanese by adoption.

864
01:19:58,096 --> 01:20:02,692
In 1960 I married Emir Abadie,

865
01:20:02,968 --> 01:20:05,493
and I am queen of Lebanon in exile,

866
01:20:05,704 --> 01:20:10,368
for, as you know, my country
is currently a socialist republic.

867
01:20:10,676 --> 01:20:13,144
I am therefore
in Nice incognito,

868
01:20:13,412 --> 01:20:16,711
as my husband and I
have terrible enemies.

869
01:20:17,015 --> 01:20:20,348
There's a price
on our heads in Lebanon.

870
01:20:20,619 --> 01:20:24,578
I'm often the target
of machine-gun fire,

871
01:20:24,856 --> 01:20:28,587
which always misses me,
no doubt due to Allah's protection,

872
01:20:28,794 --> 01:20:33,288
because to marry the emir,
I had to convert to Islam.

873
01:20:33,498 --> 01:20:39,164
I've flown to Beirut twice
in my husband's space machine,

874
01:20:39,371 --> 01:20:42,807
and the marabout of Atla -

875
01:20:43,008 --> 01:20:44,999
Alexis, don't let me go flying off.

876
01:20:45,210 --> 01:20:48,839
The sea is choppy,
and you know how light I am.

877
01:20:57,189 --> 01:20:59,680
Help me, Ferdinand.

878
01:21:09,901 --> 01:21:12,426
Ferdinand,
we weigh anchor in an hour.

879
01:21:12,638 --> 01:21:13,730
Yes, Princess.

880
01:21:13,939 --> 01:21:16,464
Alexis, we're going into town.

881
01:21:21,246 --> 01:21:22,713
<i>Pierrot!</i>

882
01:21:40,165 --> 01:21:41,393
It's me.

883
01:21:41,867 --> 01:21:43,801
My name's Ferdinand.

884
01:21:44,002 --> 01:21:45,401
Hi.

885
01:21:45,604 --> 01:21:48,471
You don't seem
too surprised to see me.

886
01:21:49,141 --> 01:21:50,904
What are you doing here?

887
01:21:51,209 --> 01:21:55,305
I'm so happy.
I've found you at last.

888
01:21:57,649 --> 01:22:00,675
- Where are you staying?
- With you, you idiot!

889
01:22:00,986 --> 01:22:05,150
I'm staying with you.
I've looked all over for you.

890
01:22:09,728 --> 01:22:12,629
You should have waited
after you called me.

891
01:22:12,831 --> 01:22:14,731
I wanted to.

892
01:22:14,933 --> 01:22:18,027
I got away
before those men arrived.

893
01:22:18,303 --> 01:22:22,069
I ran to the dance hall
to warn you not to come,

894
01:22:22,274 --> 01:22:24,504
but I didn't see you,

895
01:22:24,710 --> 01:22:30,376
so I went back, and I saw
those men getting into the blue Ford.

896
01:22:30,582 --> 01:22:33,312
I thought they'd killed you.

897
01:22:34,786 --> 01:22:38,278
So I took off.
I didn't care where.

898
01:22:38,557 --> 01:22:43,256
I don't even remember where.
I was afraid to come back to the coast.

899
01:22:44,296 --> 01:22:49,734
Then one day I ran into Fred
in a bar in Toulon.

900
01:22:50,001 --> 01:22:53,402
It's true.
The Las Vegas bar, in Toulon.

901
01:22:53,605 --> 01:22:57,302
- How'd you know I was working here?
- That was by chance too.

902
01:22:58,343 --> 01:23:00,368
It's true.

903
01:23:02,547 --> 01:23:04,515
I believe you, liar.

904
01:23:04,783 --> 01:23:07,445
Why don't you ever believe
that I love you?

905
01:23:07,753 --> 01:23:09,880
I love you in my own way.

906
01:23:10,155 --> 01:23:11,782
That's just it.

907
01:23:12,357 --> 01:23:14,825
I'll prove it. Look.

908
01:23:15,026 --> 01:23:18,462
I went back to our beach
and got your notebook.

909
01:23:18,663 --> 01:23:19,994
Thanks.

910
01:23:20,465 --> 01:23:22,456
Look on the last page.

911
01:23:24,002 --> 01:23:27,199
There's a little poem
I wrote about you.

912
01:23:28,106 --> 01:23:30,836
"Tender and cruel...

913
01:23:31,109 --> 01:23:34,476
real and surreal...

914
01:23:34,679 --> 01:23:37,705
terrifying and funny...

915
01:23:37,916 --> 01:23:40,908
nocturnal and diurnal...

916
01:23:41,119 --> 01:23:44,247
usual and unusual...

917
01:23:44,990 --> 01:23:47,117
handsome as anything.
- Crazy Pierrot!"

918
01:23:47,325 --> 01:23:50,453
I told you my name's Ferdinand,
goddamn it!

919
01:23:50,662 --> 01:23:54,325
If you think you're tough
saying "goddamn it," you're wrong.

920
01:23:54,533 --> 01:23:56,558
God can go to -

921
01:23:56,768 --> 01:23:58,463
Don't talk like that.

922
01:23:58,970 --> 01:24:00,096
You should talk.

923
01:24:00,305 --> 01:24:03,297
We're wanted for murder.
You know what murder is?

924
01:24:03,508 --> 01:24:06,944
Sure. What about it?
Does it scare you?

925
01:24:08,747 --> 01:24:10,374
Answer me.

926
01:24:10,615 --> 01:24:14,449
I look at you and listen to you,
but that's not what counts.

927
01:24:14,753 --> 01:24:15,981
Thanks a lot.

928
01:24:16,288 --> 01:24:20,122
No, I mean this very moment -
which is already past.

929
01:24:20,392 --> 01:24:25,853
Oh, I don't know. It's the blue
of the sky, our relationship.

930
01:24:26,164 --> 01:24:27,825
I don't get it.

931
01:24:29,301 --> 01:24:31,531
I wish time would stand still.

932
01:24:32,370 --> 01:24:34,964
Look. I'm putting my hand
on your knee.

933
01:24:35,974 --> 01:24:39,876
That's a wonderful thing in itself.
That's life.

934
01:24:40,312 --> 01:24:43,406
Space, feelings.

935
01:24:45,050 --> 01:24:49,180
But instead I'm following you
back to our tale of sound and fury.

936
01:24:49,521 --> 01:24:52,786
But I don't care.
- Are you coming? Fred's waiting.

937
01:24:52,991 --> 01:24:56,290
Forget I said anything.
Let's go, daddy-o.

938
01:24:59,397 --> 01:25:02,628
I wonder what's keeping the cops.
We should be in jail by now.

939
01:25:02,834 --> 01:25:06,895
They're smart.
They let people destroy themselves.

940
01:25:35,534 --> 01:25:37,502
Why do you do things like that?

941
01:25:37,702 --> 01:25:41,229
I tell you I didn't kill him.

942
01:25:57,389 --> 01:26:00,586
It's funny we're still alive
after that parade of corpses.

943
01:26:00,792 --> 01:26:03,955
- Yeah - ho ho ho.
- Looks like <i>Pépé le Moko</i> around here.

944
01:26:04,162 --> 01:26:05,595
Who?

945
01:26:06,431 --> 01:26:08,558
<i>- Pépé le Moko.</i>
- Who's that?

946
01:26:08,833 --> 01:26:11,131
You sure don't know much.

947
01:26:16,875 --> 01:26:19,400
What about you?
You know what you are?

948
01:26:19,711 --> 01:26:21,941
I'm a man with sexual desires.

949
01:26:22,714 --> 01:26:24,113
Says you!

950
01:26:24,816 --> 01:26:28,809
I know who you are,
but you don't.

951
01:26:29,020 --> 01:26:30,282
It's true.

952
01:26:30,488 --> 01:26:35,221
I'm just a huge question mark
hanging over the Mediterranean horizon.

953
01:26:46,871 --> 01:26:50,204
"...their truth...
independent of us... our logic..."

954
01:26:51,776 --> 01:26:53,471
Are your parents still alive?

955
01:26:53,778 --> 01:26:57,009
Yes. They've never been apart.

956
01:26:57,382 --> 01:26:59,873
They were almost
separated once.

957
01:27:00,719 --> 01:27:03,745
Papa was leaving on a trip.
I can't remember where.

958
01:27:03,955 --> 01:27:05,980
Some short trip.

959
01:27:06,558 --> 01:27:09,959
They didn't have
money for two tickets.

960
01:27:10,362 --> 01:27:13,160
Mama went with him
to the bus stop,

961
01:27:13,732 --> 01:27:15,700
and they looked at each other,

962
01:27:15,900 --> 01:27:19,267
Mama from the sidewalk,
Papa from the window.

963
01:27:20,205 --> 01:27:24,369
Just as the bus started up,
Papa dashed to get off.

964
01:27:24,576 --> 01:27:26,771
He didn't want to leave Mama.

965
01:27:26,978 --> 01:27:32,143
While he got off in front,
she was getting on in back,

966
01:27:32,350 --> 01:27:34,648
because she didn't want
to leave his side.

967
01:27:34,853 --> 01:27:37,253
In the end, he didn't go.

968
01:27:37,455 --> 01:27:40,253
What did you do
when you worked in an elevator?

969
01:27:40,458 --> 01:27:44,155
Nothing.
I looked at people's faces.

970
01:27:44,362 --> 01:27:47,297
- Where was that?
- The Galeries Lafayette.

971
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:50,929
Why all these questions?

972
01:27:51,236 --> 01:27:53,295
I want to know
exactly who you are.

973
01:27:53,505 --> 01:27:56,338
I never knew,
not even five years ago.

974
01:27:56,541 --> 01:28:00,204
I'm just a sentimental girl,
that's all.

975
01:28:00,945 --> 01:28:03,709
Only a fool would make
a big mystery out of that.

976
01:28:03,915 --> 01:28:06,315
What's your brother do?

977
01:28:06,518 --> 01:28:09,544
I never know
when you're making things up.

978
01:28:10,121 --> 01:28:12,055
Oh, you know -

979
01:28:12,257 --> 01:28:14,225
What was he doing
in Tel Aviv?

980
01:28:17,095 --> 01:28:20,223
Listen: There's a war
going on in Yemen.

981
01:28:20,432 --> 01:28:22,832
You're really out of touch.

982
01:28:23,468 --> 01:28:26,699
He gets money
from the Royalists.

983
01:28:26,905 --> 01:28:29,897
Are those other men
with the Arab League?

984
01:28:30,275 --> 01:28:31,970
I don't know. Probably.

985
01:28:32,177 --> 01:28:34,304
Is there really
a troupe of dancers?

986
01:28:34,946 --> 01:28:36,777
What do you care?

987
01:28:36,981 --> 01:28:38,949
Why does he need a cover?

988
01:28:39,150 --> 01:28:42,142
Gun-running's practically
official business these days.

989
01:28:42,353 --> 01:28:45,049
- What do you care?
- Answer me.

990
01:28:45,256 --> 01:28:47,656
I'll tell you something.

991
01:28:48,059 --> 01:28:52,894
There are 3,600 seconds
in an hour.

992
01:28:53,832 --> 01:28:57,962
That makes
about 100,000 seconds in a day.

993
01:28:58,937 --> 01:29:02,134
In an average lifetime,
that makes...

994
01:29:03,641 --> 01:29:07,202
250 billion seconds.

995
01:29:08,279 --> 01:29:13,546
All in all, you and I have spent
about one month together.

996
01:29:14,252 --> 01:29:19,884
Add it up. I've only been
with you a few million seconds

997
01:29:20,191 --> 01:29:23,683
out of the 250 billion
that make up your life.

998
01:29:24,362 --> 01:29:26,057
It's not much.

999
01:29:26,264 --> 01:29:28,289
So I'm not surprised

1000
01:29:28,500 --> 01:29:31,162
we don't know
who each other is.

1001
01:29:47,018 --> 01:29:49,612
...5, 6, 7, 8.

1002
01:29:49,821 --> 01:29:51,846
You made it!

1003
01:29:53,658 --> 01:29:56,786
Will he do it?
- Yeah, anything I say.

1004
01:29:57,629 --> 01:29:59,688
<i>What a crazy set-up</i>

1005
01:30:00,899 --> 01:30:03,060
...6, 7, 8!

1006
01:30:07,906 --> 01:30:10,739
"To see clearly... reason... life."

1007
01:30:31,763 --> 01:30:33,458
What am I supposed to do?

1008
01:30:34,332 --> 01:30:35,993
Just do as you're told.

1009
01:30:36,301 --> 01:30:39,634
Keep your eyes and ears open
and you'll see.

1010
01:30:40,805 --> 01:30:43,239
Remember
the scent of eucalyptus?

1011
01:30:44,409 --> 01:30:47,435
<i>- With you it's always so complicated.</i>
<i>- No, it's simple.</i>

1012
01:30:47,645 --> 01:30:48,942
<i>Too much going on.</i>

1013
01:30:50,381 --> 01:30:52,406
<i>There's a little harbor,</i>
<i>like in a Conrad novel.</i>

1014
01:30:52,617 --> 01:30:55,518
<i>A sailboat,</i>
<i>like in Robert Louis Stevenson.</i>

1015
01:30:55,787 --> 01:30:58,255
<i>An old brothel, like in Faulkner.</i>

1016
01:30:58,556 --> 01:31:00,649
<i>A steward turned multimillionaire,</i>

1017
01:31:00,859 --> 01:31:02,850
<i>like in Jack London.</i>

1018
01:31:03,294 --> 01:31:06,058
<i>- With you it's always so complicated.</i>
<i>- No, it's simple.</i>

1019
01:31:06,264 --> 01:31:08,255
<i>Too much going on.</i>

1020
01:31:08,466 --> 01:31:12,664
<i>Two guys beat me up,</i>
<i>like in Raymond Chandler.</i>

1021
01:31:12,971 --> 01:31:16,202
<i>You and me and him -
<i>see how simple it is?</i>

1022
01:31:16,507 --> 01:31:17,565
<i>No, I don't see.</i>

1023
01:31:17,842 --> 01:31:19,036
<i>- They want to</i>
<i>- buy the yacht.</i>

1024
01:31:19,310 --> 01:31:20,402
<i>- The old man</i>
<i>- isn't French.</i>

1025
01:31:20,712 --> 01:31:22,270
<i>- My brother</i>
<i>- collects the money.</i>

1026
01:31:22,580 --> 01:31:24,013
<i>- The others</i>
<i>- don't know.</i>

1027
01:31:24,315 --> 01:31:25,407
<i>- They'll be</i>
<i>- furious.</i>

1028
01:31:25,683 --> 01:31:28,015
<i>They'll tail Fred.</i>
<i>We'll get rid of them.</i>

1029
01:31:28,219 --> 01:31:30,312
<i>- And then?</i>
<i>- Just do as you're told.</i>

1030
01:32:01,886 --> 01:32:03,911
<i>A woman can kill</i>
<i>lots of people easy.</i>

1031
01:32:04,122 --> 01:32:07,023
<i>Full breasts and soft thighs</i>
<i>don't mean</i>

1032
01:32:07,325 --> 01:32:11,989
<i>she can't kill everyone</i>
<i>to remain free or protect herself.</i>

1033
01:32:12,196 --> 01:32:16,223
<i>Just look at Cuba</i>
<i>or Vietnam or Israel.</i>

1034
01:32:31,516 --> 01:32:33,711
- I love you!
- Me too!

1035
01:33:42,653 --> 01:33:46,145
<i>Next chapter: Despair.</i>

1036
01:33:46,357 --> 01:33:47,688
<i>Next chapter:</i>

1037
01:33:47,892 --> 01:33:50,884
<i>Freedom... Bitterness.</i>

1038
01:34:11,215 --> 01:34:13,183
Seen a young woman around

1039
01:34:13,384 --> 01:34:15,511
like a Hollywood
movie star in Technicolor?

1040
01:34:16,087 --> 01:34:17,884
None of your business.

1041
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:24,050
You got it?

1042
01:34:24,529 --> 01:34:27,692
We all meet tonight as planned?

1043
01:34:32,603 --> 01:34:34,503
Some people saw me.

1044
01:34:35,573 --> 01:34:36,904
I don't understand.

1045
01:34:37,108 --> 01:34:39,201
Fred will look innocent now.

1046
01:34:39,477 --> 01:34:41,536
Why are you double-crossing me?

1047
01:34:45,149 --> 01:34:46,480
What's the matter?

1048
01:34:46,784 --> 01:34:50,720
Nothing. Just looking
at a woman who's tormenting me.

1049
01:34:50,922 --> 01:34:54,358
$50,000 would make
anyone nervous, Pierrot.

1050
01:34:54,559 --> 01:34:56,117
My name's Ferdinand.

1051
01:34:56,627 --> 01:35:00,563
Why did you kiss me earlier?
- I felt like it.

1052
01:35:03,267 --> 01:35:06,794
- Kiss me again.
- Not in front of everyone.

1053
01:35:08,873 --> 01:35:11,364
Why do you wear
such tight pants?

1054
01:35:11,576 --> 01:35:16,070
Listen. If you don't like it,
go back to Paris.

1055
01:35:16,814 --> 01:35:18,406
Kiss me.

1056
01:35:18,816 --> 01:35:20,511
Okay, I get it.

1057
01:35:21,185 --> 01:35:23,813
You know, it's bad luck
to double-cross us.

1058
01:35:24,088 --> 01:35:25,817
<i>Speak Not, Cassandra.</i>

1059
01:35:26,023 --> 01:35:28,423
- What?
- It's the title of this novel.

1060
01:35:28,626 --> 01:35:30,025
Stupid jerk.

1061
01:35:33,297 --> 01:35:34,855
Hey!

1062
01:35:35,066 --> 01:35:37,034
Marianne!
- What?

1063
01:35:37,235 --> 01:35:42,502
TWA, Nice airport, the 2:45 to Tahiti.
We just climb aboard.

1064
01:35:43,274 --> 01:35:45,242
Just the two of us, obviously.

1065
01:35:45,443 --> 01:35:47,308
Obviously.

1066
01:35:54,018 --> 01:35:55,645
Obviously.

1067
01:35:56,354 --> 01:35:58,083
French is funny.

1068
01:35:58,289 --> 01:36:01,258
Words say the opposite
of what they mean.

1069
01:36:01,526 --> 01:36:05,087
We say "obviously"
when things aren't obvious at all.

1070
01:36:05,296 --> 01:36:08,788
Like it wasn't obvious
that I'd find the old man

1071
01:36:09,100 --> 01:36:12,035
with a bullet-hole in his forehead.

1072
01:36:12,603 --> 01:36:14,628
Did you know
your brother would kill him?

1073
01:36:14,839 --> 01:36:16,602
It was none of my business.

1074
01:36:16,807 --> 01:36:18,968
I'd like to run off with you,

1075
01:36:19,310 --> 01:36:22,177
but Fred will find us
and get even.

1076
01:36:22,446 --> 01:36:25,313
I saw him get even
with a girl once.

1077
01:36:25,583 --> 01:36:27,642
I'll protect you.

1078
01:36:30,121 --> 01:36:33,249
Okay. But I have to go alone
or they'll suspect.

1079
01:36:33,524 --> 01:36:34,752
Okay, my beautiful.

1080
01:36:35,059 --> 01:36:36,583
Okay, my handsome.

1081
01:36:39,931 --> 01:36:44,527
Well, I'm off, since we have
nothing more to say.

1082
01:36:44,735 --> 01:36:46,862
Meet me in half an hour.

1083
01:36:48,739 --> 01:36:50,400
I'll count to...

1084
01:36:51,475 --> 01:36:53,102
137.

1085
01:36:54,845 --> 01:36:56,642
You're really crazy.

1086
01:37:01,953 --> 01:37:04,285
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...

1087
01:37:06,824 --> 01:37:08,314
The briefcase!

1088
01:37:08,626 --> 01:37:11,254
Start the car.
Trust me and I'll trust you.

1089
01:37:11,462 --> 01:37:13,623
...18, 19, 20, 21, 22...

1090
01:39:27,365 --> 01:39:28,957
Something wrong, pal?

1091
01:39:29,233 --> 01:39:31,895
It's that tune.

1092
01:39:32,169 --> 01:39:34,399
You have no idea
what it means to me.

1093
01:39:34,705 --> 01:39:36,070
You hear it?

1094
01:39:36,374 --> 01:39:38,604
No, I don't hear anything.

1095
01:39:39,443 --> 01:39:41,707
You wouldn't understand.

1096
01:39:41,979 --> 01:39:44,948
That tune's my whole life.

1097
01:39:45,483 --> 01:39:48,680
When I hear it, it just -

1098
01:39:49,086 --> 01:39:53,147
One day I was home.
It was playing on the radio.

1099
01:39:57,194 --> 01:40:02,860
She sat beside me,
this magnificent, beautiful woman.

1100
01:40:04,969 --> 01:40:06,937
I took her hand

1101
01:40:07,204 --> 01:40:11,106
and stroked the back of it,
like this.

1102
01:40:11,909 --> 01:40:16,107
I asked her...
<i>Do you love me</i>

1103
01:40:19,083 --> 01:40:22,109
She said no.

1104
01:40:22,686 --> 01:40:26,452
So I bought the record,
because that music just -

1105
01:40:29,126 --> 01:40:31,959
Like my own private case
of mass hysteria.

1106
01:40:32,396 --> 01:40:36,594
One day at home,
I put on the record.

1107
01:40:38,402 --> 01:40:40,632
It went around and around

1108
01:40:40,905 --> 01:40:43,669
in my head!
Everything was spinning!

1109
01:40:44,675 --> 01:40:47,940
She was beside me -
a different woman.

1110
01:40:48,212 --> 01:40:50,908
Not as pretty as the first...

1111
01:40:53,184 --> 01:40:57,484
but anyway,
I took her hand

1112
01:40:57,922 --> 01:41:03,326
and stroked it on the other side
this time, just for a change.

1113
01:41:04,161 --> 01:41:08,461
I asked...
<i>Do you love me</i>

1114
01:41:10,868 --> 01:41:13,336
And she said, "Oh, I do!"

1115
01:41:16,440 --> 01:41:20,536
But I didn't love her,
so I broke the record!

1116
01:41:23,447 --> 01:41:28,714
One day I turned on the radio,
and it was playing.

1117
01:41:28,919 --> 01:41:31,285
Why that song?
Why not something else?

1118
01:41:31,789 --> 01:41:36,055
She was beside me - no, other side,
'cause we were at her place.

1119
01:41:36,260 --> 01:41:38,421
This was a third woman.

1120
01:41:39,263 --> 01:41:44,200
I took her hand and stroked it -
on both sides, just to be done with it.

1121
01:41:44,401 --> 01:41:47,564
It was getting on my nerves.

1122
01:41:47,838 --> 01:41:51,296
I asked...
<i>Do you love me</i>

1123
01:41:52,877 --> 01:41:54,936
She said yes.

1124
01:41:57,147 --> 01:41:59,877
I asked,
"Will you give me your hand?"

1125
01:42:00,150 --> 01:42:03,210
She said, "You've been
holding it for ten minutes."

1126
01:42:03,420 --> 01:42:05,752
And she was right.

1127
01:42:07,992 --> 01:42:11,257
So I kept her and her hand
for ten years!

1128
01:42:13,364 --> 01:42:17,630
Ten years!
I can't stand that song anymore!

1129
01:42:18,002 --> 01:42:20,061
You hear it?

1130
01:42:20,271 --> 01:42:23,365
I can't stand it anymore.
You hear it?

1131
01:42:24,341 --> 01:42:28,300
That one, right there -
you don't hear it?

1132
01:42:29,413 --> 01:42:33,713
Tell me: Am I crazy?
Come right out and say it!

1133
01:42:33,918 --> 01:42:37,945
I want to hear you say it.
Say, "You're crazy!"

1134
01:42:38,155 --> 01:42:41,215
- You're crazy.
- That's more like it.

1135
01:42:50,534 --> 01:42:52,695
- Going to the island?
- Yes, sir.

1136
01:42:52,903 --> 01:42:55,463
- What's your boat called?
- The <i>Sawonga.</i>

1137
01:42:56,574 --> 01:42:58,974
Just <i>Sawonga's</i> you get me there!

1138
01:43:09,753 --> 01:43:12,881
So that song I hear isn't real?

1139
01:43:13,924 --> 01:43:16,654
That music
that's haunted me all my life?

1140
01:43:16,860 --> 01:43:19,727
That tenderness?
No! Insensitive man!

1141
01:43:21,231 --> 01:43:23,495
You missed the whole point!

1142
01:43:48,993 --> 01:43:51,120
<i>Do you love me</i>

1143
01:44:39,643 --> 01:44:43,101
<i>I held her close</i>
<i>and began to cry.</i>

1144
01:44:43,580 --> 01:44:47,209
<i>It was our first,</i>
<i>our only dream.</i>

1145
01:45:10,574 --> 01:45:12,872
Get me Paris, please.

1146
01:45:13,577 --> 01:45:16,102
BALzac 75-02.

1147
01:45:17,281 --> 01:45:19,875
You've forgotten Balzac too?

1148
01:45:21,018 --> 01:45:22,713
Yes, I'll wait.

1149
01:45:32,062 --> 01:45:33,723
It hurts.

1150
01:45:36,800 --> 01:45:38,859
You shouldn't have done it.

1151
01:45:51,915 --> 01:45:54,679
You shouldn't have done it.

1152
01:45:58,589 --> 01:46:01,183
Forgive me, Pierrot.

1153
01:46:01,859 --> 01:46:03,952
My name's Ferdinand.

1154
01:46:04,161 --> 01:46:05,924
It's too late.

1155
01:46:14,872 --> 01:46:19,400
"...dynamite, machine guns...
supply the rebels..."

1156
01:46:32,422 --> 01:46:34,652
Yes, I'll wait.

1157
01:46:47,404 --> 01:46:49,964
BALzac 75-02?

1158
01:46:50,741 --> 01:46:52,902
Is Mrs. Griffon there?

1159
01:46:54,978 --> 01:46:56,275
Who's this?

1160
01:46:56,980 --> 01:46:58,709
Is that you, Odile?

1161
01:46:59,817 --> 01:47:01,717
How are the children?

1162
01:47:03,520 --> 01:47:05,750
No, no. Nobody's calling.

1163
01:47:13,130 --> 01:47:15,098
"Art... death"

1164
01:47:50,534 --> 01:47:53,503
What I wanted to say -

1165
01:47:57,574 --> 01:47:59,201
What's the point?

1166
01:49:00,170 --> 01:49:03,662
What an idiot! Shit!
A glorious death -

1167
01:49:43,347 --> 01:49:44,939
<i>- It's ours again.</i>
<i>- What is?</i>

1168
01:49:45,148 --> 01:49:47,514
<i>- Eternity.</i>
<i>- That's just the sea, gone...</i>

1169
01:49:47,718 --> 01:49:49,515
<i>With the sun.</i>
