Make the most of this beautiful train.

30
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:50,229
That's it. Okay.

31
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:55,067
Yeah.

32
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:57,236
That's really great. Yeah, yeah.

33
00:03:57,321 --> 00:04:00,698
Okay, now, as I said before,
you're under no obligation to,

34
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:04,201
but you can if you want to,
give me a tiny, little twinkle.

35
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:06,996
Yeah, that is... lovely.

36
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,040
All right, a little bit closer.

37
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,752
As you were. Are you all right?

38
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:18,257
Hair's just a little bit...

39
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,719
That's it. And you've got
an eyelash on your nose.

40
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:23,054
We don't want that, do we?

41
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:25,848
It's supposed to be on your eye,
not on your snitch.

42
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:28,726
That's it! You've got a lovely smile
when you smile, haven't you?

43
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,394
Right, okay.

44
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,855
Now, you keep that lovely, gorgeous smile.

45
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:34,857
That's lovely.

46
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:39,654
I think that'll do for the time being.
Well done, Sarah. That's the easy bit.

47
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:03,302
- They make a noise, don't they?
- At least they can play out around here.

48
00:05:03,387 --> 00:05:05,137
I suppose so.

49
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:11,060
What is it?

50
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,436
Is that a suit?

51
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,314
It came as a combination.

52
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:17,024
Do they go together?

53
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:20,319
Well, if you think they do, they do.
And if you think they don't, they don't.

54
00:05:20,404 --> 00:05:21,404
It's nice.

55
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:28,995
Twenty-one in August.

56
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:31,539
She is.

57
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:34,375
I used to worry meself sick
when she played out.

58
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,627
She survived it, though, didn't she?

59
00:05:36,712 --> 00:05:38,337
All things considering.

60
00:05:38,422 --> 00:05:40,631
She's back on the streets now.

61
00:05:40,716 --> 00:05:41,757
I beg your pardon.

62
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:43,718
Well, she is, isn't she?

63
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:45,469
I don't half miss her.

64
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:47,138
I know.

65
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:50,850
How long is it since we've seen her?

66
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:54,437
Two and a half years.

67
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:58,983
- We could always ask her over.
- I'd like to.

68
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:02,111
For her birthday.
It's only a couple of months away.

69
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:04,780
What now?

70
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,909
"Hey, Roxanne,
what are you doing for your 21st?"

71
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:12,371
"I'm going over to my auntie
and uncle's house for my birthday treat."

72
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:15,833
It was only a suggestion.

73
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,711
She's probably doing her own thing.

74
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:22,923
I suppose we'd have to invite
Cynthia as well.

75
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:24,967
There's no show without Punch.

76
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:28,054
- I'm sure she'd like to see the place.
- Oh, I'm sure she would.

77
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:30,931
- She can't help it.
- Can't she?

78
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:36,020
It's about time we showed it off.

79
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:39,440
I mean, you've done a lovely job.

80
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:41,067
I think so.

81
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:50,034
I really must get down to see her.

82
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:53,662
- You speak to her on the phone, don't you?
- It's not the same thing, though, is it?

83
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:57,416
She's your sister.

84
00:06:57,501 --> 00:07:00,169
I'm really proud of that portrait.

85
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:03,631
I reckon that's the last time
she ever smiled.

86
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,347
I don't know what's got into you lately.

87
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:56,100
- You complaining?
- No.

88
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:57,852
Well, shut up, then.

89
00:07:57,936 --> 00:08:02,148
I sit here on me own for years on end,
can't get you to stop in at all.

90
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:03,983
- Now you never go out.
- Leave it out.

91
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:07,111
You've been sitting there for a month
with a face like a slapped arse.

92
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:09,822
Well, what's there to smile about?

93
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:16,579
Thought he might have
phoned at the weekend.

94
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:17,788
Who?

95
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:21,667
Who do you think?
I ain't heard from him for ages.

96
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,878
- He's busy, ain't he.
- We're all busy.

97
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:26,505
He's got his weddings and that.
It's the summer.

98
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:28,674
Out of sight, out of mind.

99
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:31,654
If you're that bothered, why don't you
ring him yourself? He's your brother.

100
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,971
I'm not running up me phone bill!

101
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,933
He knows where I am if he wants me.

102
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,856
He'd have had us up there to see it
by now, I expect, if it weren't for her.

103
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:47,109
Toffee-nosed cow.

104
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:52,031
What's he want with six bedrooms anyway?

105
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:06,253
What's all your mates doing tonight, then?

106
00:09:06,338 --> 00:09:07,963
I don't know. I ain't asked 'em.

107
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:14,511
You wanna get yourself a bloke.
That's what you wanna do.

108
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:18,349
I told you, I don't want to get anything.
I'm quite happy here, thank you very much.

109
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:21,310
When I was your age,
I could have had the pick of the crop.

110
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:22,853
Well, why didn't ya?

111
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:26,065
Because I lost my poor mother, that's why.

112
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:27,191
Oh, here we go.

113
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:31,028
I was stuck at home from the age of ten,
looking after Maurice and your grandad.

114
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,238
Yeah, we know.

115
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:37,409
Then I got saddled with you.
That was my downfall, darling.

116
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:39,119
I didn't ask to be born.

117
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:41,205
No, and I never asked
to have you, neither.

118
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:44,708
Well, you should have thought about that
before you dropped your knickers.

119
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:55,970
With... or without?

120
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:58,138
- I think without.
- Without?

121
00:09:58,223 --> 00:09:59,515
- Yeah.
- Okay.

122
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:02,476
What about this one?

123
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,895
Better with or without?

124
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,647
I think this time, it's with.

125
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:09,692
With?
All right, we'll pop this one in, then.

126
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,947
- I hear you're a really good runner.
- Yeah, cross-country.

127
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:16,699
Have you won anything?

128
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:19,076
Not yet. I've only just started.

129
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,453
Okay, then. Look up again.

130
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:25,916
Now, this is gonna blur a bit,
but just tell me what you can read. Okay?

131
00:10:27,002 --> 00:10:30,170
H-L-A-C-I.

132
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:32,756
- Right.
- And I can't read any more.

133
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:34,216
Okay, that's good.

134
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,303
Very good. I'm gonna do
your other eye now.

135
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:50,149
- You off, then?
- Yeah.

136
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:51,442
Got any plans for the weekend?

137
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:54,166
Well, I've got to go to my mum's house
and sort through her things.

138
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:55,404
- Oh, have you?
- Yeah.

139
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,573
- Hope it goes all right.
- Well, it's gotta be done.

140
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,241
- Yeah.
- Okay, then.

141
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:01,410
- Right. I'll see you on Monday.
- Yeah.

142
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,162
- Have a nice weekend.
- Cheers.

143
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:06,999
- Ooh! Enjoy the christening.
- I'll try.

144
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,625
- Okay, bye.
- Bye!

145
00:11:51,503 --> 00:11:53,670
It's ten past.
We've got to pick Shelattica up.

146
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:56,400
- What are you talking about?
- We've got ten minutes!

147
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:58,944
Listen, right? We've gotta sort
this out while we're here.

148
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:02,721
Look, basically, right,
it's you, one, here in this massive house.

149
00:12:02,806 --> 00:12:06,183
Thank you. We have got
two children, you understand?

150
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:07,768
- And we could have more.
- What?

151
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:09,478
We want to have more.

152
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:12,648
Listen, right?
You can't stay here on your own.

153
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:15,442
It's not fair, is it?
I mean, we can sell the house, can't we?

154
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:16,985
Sell the house and split the money.

155
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,550
Listen, you know what?
You could split this whole house in two.

156
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:22,616
You could split this into two flats
and it'd still be bigger than our place.

157
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,411
- Exactly.
- Split it in two? Can't split it.

158
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,783
Let's sort your tie out for you,
if I might.

159
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:07,471
- Looks just a little bit skew-whiffy.
- Skew-whiff again.

160
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:09,621
There it is. That's lovely.
Do you want the paper out?

161
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:11,457
- Yeah, yeah, okay.
- Cheers.

162
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,250
You ladies look gorgeous.

163
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:16,670
Hands together there. Really nice.

164
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:19,756
Okay, here we go.
Put your paper down there.

165
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:22,134
Right, and here we go. Okay, and...

166
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:25,053
- Do we say "cheese," Maurice?
- You can if you like.

167
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:27,556
You can. You can say "cheese."
You can say whatever you like.

168
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,767
But just give me a little ̶̶ That's it.

169
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:33,854
Oh, yeah. Very sweet.

170
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:36,148
Okay, that's lovely.

171
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:38,400
- So that took you 15 years, yeah?
- Yes.

172
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:40,152
- They give you a prize?
- No.

173
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:42,446
Not even
a stethoscope or something? Lovely.

174
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,114
Ooh, little baby.

175
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:46,969
- That's really lovely.
- I'm so glad he's got his eyes open.

176
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:51,205
Yeah, that's it.
And give him a look down. Lovely.

177
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:53,916
Are you gonna see that flea collar?
Are you gonna see that?

178
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,668
Don't worry about that.
You come out now. Come out.

179
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:58,879
- You just come of the way.
- That's it.

180
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:01,590
Pop out now. And out. And here we go.

181
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,717
I think I left the comb
in there that time.

182
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:06,595
- Lovely! Very good.
- Does he look good?

183
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:09,515
- He does look good, yeah. So do you.
- Oh, good. Yes, yes.

184
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:11,600
Thank you very much, Jane. That's lovely.

185
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:14,228
- It's for my auntie.
- Oh, right. Fond of you, is she?

186
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:17,147
- No, she's in India.
- Oh, right.

187
00:14:17,232 --> 00:14:18,982
Time I got married, innit?

188
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:22,277
Oh, I see.
Pick a bride time, is it?

189
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:24,488
I've told you, I don't want flash ̶̶

190
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:26,114
And... lovely!

191
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,786
I never thought I'd have any.

192
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:33,038
Fertility treatment.

193
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:35,499
It's a miracle.

194
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:38,669
Don't do that with your nose.
Now, stop it. Put it there.

195
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:41,046
Hello, Domi ̶̶
Now look at that lovely cat.

196
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,507
- Look over there. Look at that cat!
- It's lovely!

197
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:45,551
Oh, that's it.
Let him scratch it first.

198
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:48,554
Go on. That's it. That's it.

199
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:50,264
Lovely!

200
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:52,349
This is silly.

201
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:54,268
Ah, lovely! And that's it!

202
00:14:54,352 --> 00:14:56,144
Ah, thank you very much.

203
00:15:00,692 --> 00:15:02,859
- What do you think you're doing?
- Sorry.

204
00:15:02,944 --> 00:15:05,779
- Didn't you hear me?
- No, I didn't actually.

205
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:07,197
- Hiya.
- What?

206
00:15:07,282 --> 00:15:09,783
- Hiya.
- Mind out of the way!

207
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:26,425
- Want a drink?
- What?

208
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:30,095
If I want a drink,
I'll get it myself, thank you.

209
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:46,153
Since when was hoovering
a spectator sport?

210
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:52,136
- Can I have a glass too, please?
- I thought you didn't want a drink.

211
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,287
I've changed my mind. I'm having milk.
Not in a wine glass. Give me a highball.

212
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,748
- You don't put milk in a wine glass.
- There you go.

213
00:15:57,832 --> 00:15:59,791
- Thank you.
- That'll do you good.

214
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:02,002
- Meaning?
- Nothing.

215
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:04,921
Had a good day?

216
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:06,673
Scintillating.

217
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:12,387
I suppose you'll be starving as usual.

218
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:14,306
A little bit peckish, yeah.

219
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:19,394
- Do you want me to do something?
- Like what?

220
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:21,897
- Anything you like.
- No, I bloody well wouldn't.

221
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:25,067
- Fair enough.
- Oh, all right, then.

222
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:26,943
There's the fridge.

223
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:28,862
There's the freezer.

224
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:30,572
There's the hob.

225
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:33,575
There's the recipe books. Help yourself.

226
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:36,328
And don't make a mess.

227
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:47,714
Unless you fancy a takeaway.

228
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,060
- Not gonna smile, are you?
- No.

229
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:01,978
Okay, it's a free world.

230
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:04,773
Now, you're under no obligation,
but you can, if you want to,

231
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,775
give me a lovely big smile!

232
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,610
And thank you.

233
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:11,571
Oh, go on! Come on! Lovely!

234
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:14,700
You're under no obligation to,
but you can smile if you'd like.

235
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:16,368
Yes! Thank you.

236
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:18,120
- Did you smile, Mother?
- No.

237
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:20,956
That's it. To me. That's it.
Now look at each other.

238
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,874
That's it.

239
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,353
- Don't!
- Go on. Look up.

240
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:26,097
Keep your face up, 'cause you're allowed ̶̶

241
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:29,047
That's lovely!
Ah, you were closing your eyes.

242
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,115
Don't forget to burp it properly.

243
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,200
Give it a drop of gripe water.

244
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:01,747
We used to pour it down
Roxanne by the gallon.

245
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,042
She farted like a trouper.

246
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:08,086
Runs in the family.

247
00:18:11,174 --> 00:18:13,216
Would madam care to test the temperature?

248
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:15,594
I'm sure it'll be fine, thanks.

249
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:27,522
- Been bad, has it?
- It eased off at lunchtime.

250
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:29,399
Managed a couple of crackers.

251
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:33,153
It's unpredictable, isn't it?

252
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:35,989
No, it's not unpredictable.

253
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:39,868
- You've drawn the short straw, mate.
- You're telling me.

254
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:42,496
I wish it was unpredictable.

255
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,834
What are you gonna have for your tea?

256
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,629
- Do you know what I really fancy?
- What?

257
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:51,755
A steak.

258
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:56,051
You know I haven't
any steak in this house.

259
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,302
Don't worry about me.

260
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:59,262
You'll be keeling over
with a heart attack.

261
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:00,764
I'll do myself something later.

262
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:03,642
There's a chicken Kiev in the freezer.

263
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:07,437
Be a bit cold, wouldn't it?

264
00:19:07,522 --> 00:19:10,690
Anyway... I'm on a diet.

265
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,693
You're disgusting.

266
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:16,738
Okay, that's very good.
And we can see the ring perfectly.

267
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:21,034
All right, now, sir, if you'd just
bring your chin up. Just slightly.

268
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:23,161
That's perfect. That's brilliant.
All right, great.

269
00:19:23,246 --> 00:19:25,580
Sorry. Sorry.
Can you take your glasses off?

270
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:29,334
- I don't want to take my glasses off.
- Go on, take them off.

271
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:31,545
Doesn't matter.
Keep them on, take them off.

272
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:34,464
- No, he looks better without them.
- It's what I look like, okay?

273
00:19:35,216 --> 00:19:37,611
- All right, okay, and to me.
- One minute, please.

274
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:39,219
Can you take the cross out, please?

275
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:40,637
- Hmm?
- Take the cross out.

276
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:42,222
It was a gift. Take it out.

277
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:45,517
- I just think it looks awful.
- It doesn't look awful.

278
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:48,061
It looks awful because it's not gold.
I told you to buy gold.

279
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:51,731
Okay, right.

280
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,569
Okay, and to me, yeah.
Right. That's lovely.

281
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:58,196
Now, do you want to look happy or sad?
I don't mind. Whatever.

282
00:19:58,281 --> 00:20:01,324
And look at me, and lovely!

283
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:44,492
Hello, my name's Hortense Cumberbatch.

284
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:46,578
I got your letter. Hi.

285
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,499
Oh, right. Tuesday.

286
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:58,632
Hello?

287
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:05,180
Hortense! Hello.
Jennie Ford. Nice to meet you.

288
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,640
- Oh, hi.
- Come this way.

289
00:21:06,724 --> 00:21:08,444
- How are you? All right?
- Fine, thank you.

290
00:21:08,476 --> 00:21:10,644
Good. I'm sorry about this prison cell.

291
00:21:10,728 --> 00:21:13,063
We've been banging on about it
for years, but there you go.

292
00:21:13,147 --> 00:21:15,023
Have a seat. Make yourself at home.

293
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,737
Now, before we go any further,
have you got any ID?

294
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:22,989
- Passport, driving license?
- Yes.

295
00:21:23,074 --> 00:21:24,834
You'll have to get used
to all this red tape.

296
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:26,993
- Would you like a Rolo?
- No, thank you.

297
00:21:27,078 --> 00:21:28,536
- You sure?
- Yeah.

298
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:34,501
- There you go.
- Mm. Let's have a shifty.

299
00:21:36,504 --> 00:21:38,380
- That's great, Hortense.
- Thank you.

300
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:41,424
- You on your lunch break?
- Yeah, an extended one.

301
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:43,218
- Have you had any lunch?
- No, not yet.

302
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,971
No, me neither. So what do you do?

303
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:47,389
I'm an optometrist.

304
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:50,266
Oh, really? Oh, God.

305
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:53,353
That's one of those things you keep
putting off and putting off, isn't it?

306
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:55,772
And I've got to the stage now
with The Guardian crossword

307
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:58,775
where I'm I'm going like this,
so I think the time has come, don't you?

308
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:01,444
I'll have to pop in. You can give me
a test. Where do you live?

309
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:03,363
- Kilburn.
- Right, right.

310
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:05,448
- In a flat?
- Yes.

311
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:07,826
- You share?
- No, I live on my own.

312
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:09,577
Oh, right.

313
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:13,456
I lived on my own for about six years,
before I was married.

314
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:15,458
- It's all right, isn't it?
- Yeah.

315
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:17,168
Right, Hortense.

316
00:22:18,004 --> 00:22:20,130
Let's talk a little bit
about you, shall we?

317
00:22:20,214 --> 00:22:23,174
Now, obviously, you've been giving
a great deal of thought to things

318
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:25,468
and you've come to a decision,
which is good.

319
00:22:25,553 --> 00:22:29,472
But for me the question is, why now?

320
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:33,393
I just feel that
it's the right time, that's all.

321
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:36,730
Right, right.
You thinking about getting married?

322
00:22:36,814 --> 00:22:37,897
No.

323
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:39,691
- Do you have children?
- No.

324
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:42,193
- You're thinking about having children?
- No.

325
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:43,778
That's fair enough.

326
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:45,989
Are you sharing this with your parents?

327
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:49,034
Do they know that you're here today?
I mean, how do they feel about it?

328
00:22:49,118 --> 00:22:50,910
They're both dead, actually.

329
00:22:51,996 --> 00:22:52,996
Oh, right.

330
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:57,042
Yeah, Mum died two months ago now.

331
00:22:57,126 --> 00:23:00,503
Oh, that is recent.
I'm ̶̶ I'm sorry to hear that.

332
00:23:00,588 --> 00:23:03,256
- Was it sudden?
- Yeah.

333
00:23:05,593 --> 00:23:07,886
Perhaps that's what's
made you start on this.

334
00:23:08,596 --> 00:23:10,055
I don't know.

335
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:11,347
It's possible.

336
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:16,811
Well, I'm not trying to replace her.
She's irreplaceable. Well, they both are.

337
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:18,480
No, of course, of course.

338
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:23,693
And when you were growing up,
was it a happy environment?

339
00:23:23,778 --> 00:23:25,779
- Yes, very.
- Oh, good, good.

340
00:23:25,863 --> 00:23:27,530
And did you, um ̶̶

341
00:23:27,615 --> 00:23:30,909
Were you able to discuss
the fact that you'd been ̶̶

342
00:23:30,993 --> 00:23:33,161
No, it was never really an issue.

343
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,246
Right, right.

344
00:23:35,331 --> 00:23:37,457
- So you've only just found out?
- Oh, no.

345
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,000
They told me when I was little.

346
00:23:39,085 --> 00:23:41,445
Oh, good, good. And do you remember
how you felt about that?

347
00:23:41,504 --> 00:23:43,713
Well, it's not exactly
something you forget, is it?

348
00:23:43,798 --> 00:23:45,548
No, no.

349
00:23:45,633 --> 00:23:47,050
I'm sure it isn't.

350
00:23:49,053 --> 00:23:50,553
So, how did you feel?

351
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:55,308
Well, we all just
got on with it as a family.

352
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,726
Do you know what I mean?

353
00:23:57,645 --> 00:23:58,645
Yeah.

354
00:24:00,106 --> 00:24:01,689
Perhaps you should have discussed it.

355
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:06,319
My parents loved me
and that was all that matters.

356
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:08,071
Isn't it?

357
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:10,782
Yeah, yeah.

358
00:24:12,076 --> 00:24:15,954
So, now that we've got you here,
what are your expectations?

359
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:21,459
Basically, I just want to know.

360
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:24,170
Yeah, yeah, of course you do.

361
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:28,007
Let me share something with you, Hortense.

362
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:31,803
Somewhere out there,
and we don't know where,

363
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:33,388
is your birth mother.

364
00:24:34,056 --> 00:24:37,350
Now, she's probably married. Perhaps not.

365
00:24:38,352 --> 00:24:41,688
She may have other children.
She might be dead.

366
00:24:41,772 --> 00:24:44,399
She may even be in Australia or somewhere.
We just don't know.

367
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:48,528
But what we do know is that,
at the time she gave you up for adoption,

368
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:50,071
she was under the impression

369
00:24:50,156 --> 00:24:52,782
that she would probably
never see you again.

370
00:24:52,867 --> 00:24:55,618
Now, as I know you're very well aware,

371
00:24:55,703 --> 00:24:58,663
the law has changed since then
and you are now legally entitled

372
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:00,456
to seek your birth mother out.

373
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:02,083
But the snag is...

374
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:05,962
she may not want to see you.

375
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:12,177
So I don't want you to raise
your hopes too high at this stage.

376
00:25:12,261 --> 00:25:14,804
- Sure.
- Okay.

377
00:25:14,889 --> 00:25:16,556
Have a look at this.

378
00:25:17,683 --> 00:25:19,017
What is it?

379
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:21,477
It's all about you.

380
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:27,358
I tell you what.

381
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:32,238
I'll leave it with you
and I'll pop back in in a few minutes.

382
00:25:32,323 --> 00:25:35,116
- Can I get you anything?
- No. No, thank you.

383
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:48,773
How are you doing? All right?

384
00:26:58,242 --> 00:26:59,409
Thank you.

385
00:27:09,712 --> 00:27:11,796
Cynthia Rose Purley.

386
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:13,923
That's her.

387
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:18,303
Cynthia Rose.

388
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:19,929
It's a nice name, isn't it?

389
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:24,309
- That's her signature.
- Mm-hmm.

390
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:27,437
Does that feel strange?

391
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:32,525
Elizabeth.

392
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:34,569
That's my middle name.

393
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:36,404
They must have kept it.

394
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:39,407
Well, that would be
your birth name, you see?

395
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:41,242
Elizabeth Purley.

396
00:27:49,126 --> 00:27:52,378
Listen, is there any way
I could get a copy of these?

397
00:27:52,463 --> 00:27:54,922
No, those are the originals
and they're yours to keep.

398
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:57,342
That's your right under the 1975 Act.

399
00:27:57,426 --> 00:27:58,926
I've made copies upstairs.

400
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:06,768
I'll pop those in here for you.

401
00:28:09,438 --> 00:28:10,688
So...

402
00:28:12,358 --> 00:28:14,650
what we need to do now is...

403
00:28:17,613 --> 00:28:21,032
you go away and have a think.

404
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:24,202
And when the time's right,
and not before ̶̶

405
00:28:24,286 --> 00:28:26,371
you know, it's very much
in your own time ̶̶

406
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:31,042
come back to me, if that's what you want,
and we'll get the ball rolling.

407
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:37,006
Now, it can be a very long-winded process

408
00:28:37,091 --> 00:28:38,508
and, there's no two ways about it,

409
00:28:38,592 --> 00:28:41,177
it's a very traumatic journey
you're embarking on.

410
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:46,224
And there may be other people's
feelings to consider too.

411
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:50,395
So I'll wait to hear from you, okay?

412
00:28:52,773 --> 00:28:57,360
Now, you could decide
to trace your birth mother by yourself,

413
00:28:57,444 --> 00:28:59,445
if you wanted, but I wouldn't advise it.

414
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:03,908
We're a professional service,
and we know how to handle these things.

415
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:09,122
So I think you should
take advantage of us.

416
00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:19,590
- Hello.
- Oh, you're back! Hello.

417
00:29:19,675 --> 00:29:21,217
I think I found a mistake.

418
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:23,344
I'm sorry, I can't stop.
I'm really in a hurry.

419
00:29:23,429 --> 00:29:24,869
- Look, it says she's white.
- Sorry?

420
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:26,764
"Mother: White."

421
00:29:26,849 --> 00:29:30,476
Well, it's perfectly feasible
that your mother was white, isn't it?

422
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:34,439
Look, I'm sorry, Hortense.
Really, I've got to go.

423
00:29:34,523 --> 00:29:37,525
- I'm on an emergency case.
- Yes, but could this be a mistake?

424
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:39,944
I very much doubt it.

425
00:29:40,988 --> 00:29:44,365
Look, give me a ring in the morning and
we'll have a talk then, okay? I'm sorry.

426
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:52,623
Look at that.

427
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:55,001
Legs like a teenager.

428
00:29:55,085 --> 00:29:57,462
- Do you have to?
- You'd like a pair like that.

429
00:29:57,546 --> 00:29:59,338
What for?

430
00:29:59,423 --> 00:30:01,424
I'm known for my legs.

431
00:30:02,718 --> 00:30:04,552
If you've got it, flaunt it.

432
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:07,013
- Are you going out?
- Of course I ain't.

433
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:12,226
- Who's that?
- Well, I don't know.

434
00:30:13,562 --> 00:30:16,481
If it's what's-her-name,
you could ask her to come in.

435
00:30:16,565 --> 00:30:18,399
I don't even know who it is yet!

436
00:30:21,111 --> 00:30:22,820
What you doing here?

437
00:30:22,905 --> 00:30:24,864
Just come to see you.

438
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:26,824
Well, you can't come in. My mum's here.

439
00:30:27,493 --> 00:30:29,744
- Who is it?
- I'm going out.

440
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:33,623
Hello.

441
00:30:36,752 --> 00:30:39,086
You all right, sweetheart?

442
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:40,588
Would you get inside?

443
00:30:52,768 --> 00:30:56,354
- Nothing's changed much.
- No.

444
00:30:56,438 --> 00:30:58,731
Ain't your mum been
around looking after you?

445
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:01,275
She came around Sunday after mass.

446
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,402
Didn't take you long to mess it up again.

447
00:31:03,487 --> 00:31:05,196
She's laying off me a bit now, though.

448
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,698
- Well, I should think so too, at your age.
- Yeah.

449
00:31:07,783 --> 00:31:09,492
She should have a word with my mum.

450
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:12,537
I bet she misses you, though.

451
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:17,542
Fucking... do without it
altogether, I tell you.

452
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:19,335
Yeah, I know what you mean.

453
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:21,754
You and me, mate.
We're better off without 'em.

454
00:31:24,341 --> 00:31:25,466
Look...

455
00:31:26,343 --> 00:31:29,345
I'm sorry about... you know?

456
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:30,763
So you should be.

457
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:36,811
- Don't get all serious on me, Paul.
- No, no, I ain't.

458
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:38,437
Yes, you are, you fool.

459
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:42,108
I just missed you.

460
00:31:42,776 --> 00:31:43,985
How much?

461
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,904
- A lot.
- Just a lot?

462
00:31:46,989 --> 00:31:49,448
No. Yeah...

463
00:31:49,533 --> 00:31:51,409
Well, I might have missed you a bit.

464
00:31:53,203 --> 00:31:54,954
No, I've been going out of me head.

465
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:57,748
Same as that.

466
00:32:15,017 --> 00:32:17,018
Just so's you know,
I ain't staying the night,

467
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:18,728
not every time I come round.

468
00:32:19,396 --> 00:32:22,023
And I weren't in a strop before.
I was just speaking my mind.

469
00:32:22,107 --> 00:32:23,274
All right?

470
00:32:24,318 --> 00:32:25,818
Now, give us a snog.

471
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,062
- Hello, good afternoon.
- Hello.

472
00:34:25,147 --> 00:34:27,273
Thank you very much indeed.
Right, that's fine.

473
00:34:27,357 --> 00:34:29,442
- Is that to post or collect?
- Collect, please.

474
00:34:29,526 --> 00:34:31,986
Collect. Thanks very much.
That's six pounds, please, madam.

475
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,320
Six pounds.

476
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:35,239
Okay.

477
00:34:47,461 --> 00:34:49,837
- I saw her, you know?
- Did you?

478
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:51,630
Yeah.

479
00:34:51,715 --> 00:34:55,217
Eight o'clock in the morning, she's down
Harlesden buying her yam and banana.

480
00:34:55,302 --> 00:34:58,721
She's like,
"You got a boyfriend yet, Dionne?"

481
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:01,807
Nearly everyone who went to the funeral
reckoned they'd seen her

482
00:35:01,892 --> 00:35:04,143
and she'd given them some kind of sign.

483
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:06,979
"Me see your mother
two years before she dead,

484
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:11,901
and she hold on to me hand
and look in me eye as if she did know."

485
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:20,117
I mean, if she knew, I wish she'd told us.

486
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:23,412
You're getting better, though.

487
00:35:24,915 --> 00:35:26,415
It's a nice day.

488
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:29,168
Yeah.

489
00:35:33,715 --> 00:35:35,216
I don't know.

490
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:38,511
My head can't contain it all.
It's too soon.

491
00:35:41,056 --> 00:35:43,557
There's nothing rational about grief.

492
00:35:45,477 --> 00:35:47,520
Maybe you're crying for yourself.

493
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,649
- You been out much?
- No. I can't.

494
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:56,987
Some days, I'm completely vulnerable.

495
00:35:57,072 --> 00:35:59,156
I can feel everything.

496
00:35:59,241 --> 00:36:01,408
Other days, I'm numb.

497
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:04,286
- Do you want to come out with me?
- No.

498
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:08,958
- I've got stuff to sort out.
- What?

499
00:36:10,043 --> 00:36:11,377
Life.

500
00:36:14,089 --> 00:36:17,591
- Look, if there's anything I can do...
- No, thanks.

501
00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:19,093
I'll be all right.

502
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:21,637
Have you heard from Bernard?

503
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:23,097
No.

504
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:24,306
Yes!

505
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:27,935
- He sent a sympathy card.
- Hmm?

506
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:30,521
Which I thought was
a very nice thing to do.

507
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:38,946
I did something really bad.

508
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,824
Oh, no, I don't think
I can deal with no confession.

509
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:44,118
- Cleanse my soul!
- Mm-mmm.

510
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:45,786
- I did the do.
- Don't do it.

511
00:36:45,871 --> 00:36:47,371
- Did the deed.
- Did it.

512
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:49,164
With a complete stranger.

513
00:36:49,249 --> 00:36:51,417
- Nah! Who?
- Don't know who.

514
00:36:51,501 --> 00:36:55,254
- Well, what'd he look like?
- Don't know. He was in advertising.

515
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:58,465
Oh, Lord!

516
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:00,050
Did you use a condom?

517
00:37:00,135 --> 00:37:01,468
Yes.

518
00:37:01,553 --> 00:37:03,888
Did you use two?

519
00:37:03,972 --> 00:37:06,724
- Yes.
- One on top of the other?

520
00:37:06,808 --> 00:37:08,017
One after the other.

521
00:37:08,101 --> 00:37:09,351
Oh, God!

522
00:37:11,146 --> 00:37:12,563
Do you despair of me?

523
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:13,981
No.

524
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,316
Yes, you do.

525
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,568
I don't. Did you have a good time?

526
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:20,613
- Yeah.
- That's all that matters then, isn't it?

527
00:37:20,697 --> 00:37:22,615
Yeah.

528
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:28,954
I liked my mum as a person,
but I didn't know her.

529
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:32,499
- I wish I'd known her.
- She loved you.

530
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:35,377
Yeah, I know.
But that's not in debate, is it?

531
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:40,090
My mum, she resents me.

532
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:42,217
She kept you.

533
00:37:44,012 --> 00:37:46,472
She fed ya, she clothed you.

534
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:49,391
She didn't give you away.

535
00:37:50,477 --> 00:37:52,519
- She could have.
- I wish she had.

536
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:54,146
No, you don't.

537
00:37:57,776 --> 00:38:00,319
The thing is, they're so secretive.

538
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:02,404
It's that "back home" thing, you know?

539
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:04,823
"Come out. Big people are talking."

540
00:38:04,908 --> 00:38:06,408
That sort of vibe.

541
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:10,996
So you don't pursue things,
because you're brought up not to.

542
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:13,582
I just let them get on with it.

543
00:38:17,504 --> 00:38:21,215
All I seem to do is think about things
I wish I could have asked her.

544
00:38:21,758 --> 00:38:22,925
Like what?

545
00:38:26,513 --> 00:38:27,680
I don't know.

546
00:38:29,391 --> 00:38:31,392
There's stuff I wish I knew.

547
00:38:31,476 --> 00:38:34,019
- There's stuff I wish I didn't know.
- No.

548
00:38:35,897 --> 00:38:39,400
If you knew you had a limited amount
of time, you'd sort it out.

549
00:38:39,484 --> 00:38:41,986
You'd ask your mum questions,

550
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:44,571
regardless of whether she got vexed.

551
00:38:44,656 --> 00:38:49,118
Like, I don't know, what happened
between her and your dad, for example.

552
00:38:49,202 --> 00:38:51,787
No. She didn't make no effort for me,

553
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:54,039
so why should I be interested in her?

554
00:38:54,124 --> 00:38:56,458
And where's my dad anyway?

555
00:38:56,543 --> 00:38:58,961
I don't want to hear her
and Norbert having it off.

556
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:01,588
I don't want her to know
who I'm having it off with.

557
00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:03,799
And I don't want her to see me drunk.

558
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:06,301
I don't want her to know nothing about me.

559
00:39:06,386 --> 00:39:09,805
Maybe that's because you're frightened
that when you look at her,

560
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:12,182
you can see yourself in 20 years' time.

561
00:39:12,267 --> 00:39:13,600
Please.

562
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:15,686
We choose our parents.

563
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:17,980
How do you mean?

564
00:39:18,523 --> 00:39:21,191
We choose the parents in this life

565
00:39:21,276 --> 00:39:23,027
that can teach us something,

566
00:39:23,111 --> 00:39:26,113
so that when we go into the next life,
we'll get it right.

567
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:29,158
Jhoop!

568
00:39:29,242 --> 00:39:32,077
Of course, sometimes,
it don't work, does it?

569
00:39:37,751 --> 00:39:39,501
I'm gonna pop out for a couple of hours.

570
00:39:39,586 --> 00:39:41,795
- What time will you be back?
- 4:30.

571
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,256
- Okay. Have fun.
- Thanks.

572
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:48,886
Sorry to interrupt. Could you get me
a few of these things in?

573
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:50,929
- Right.
- I'm a bit low.

574
00:39:51,014 --> 00:39:52,514
I'll give them a ring.

575
00:40:36,476 --> 00:40:39,019
Seventy...

576
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:42,916
Hello.

577
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:44,960
Bloody hell.

578
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:47,004
What you doing here?

579
00:41:47,088 --> 00:41:49,298
I thought I'd come and see you.

580
00:41:49,382 --> 00:41:50,799
Where's Monica?

581
00:41:52,385 --> 00:41:53,969
She's at home, I think.

582
00:41:55,597 --> 00:41:58,557
- You gonna let me in, then?
- Yeah, of course!

583
00:42:03,104 --> 00:42:04,771
Do you want a cup of tea?

584
00:42:04,856 --> 00:42:06,106
Yes, please.

585
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:10,611
You all right, then?

586
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:11,778
Smashing.

587
00:42:12,739 --> 00:42:14,406
You been working down this way?

588
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:16,325
Yeah, around the back of Tower Bridge.

589
00:42:17,452 --> 00:42:20,120
If I'd known you was coming,
I'd have warmed up the seat.

590
00:42:20,205 --> 00:42:21,955
It's warm enough,
I should think.

591
00:42:31,341 --> 00:42:33,926
Does Monica know you've come round here?

592
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:36,136
No, I didn't know
I was coming meself.

593
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:40,098
- She's okay, then?
- Yeah, she's fine.

594
00:42:42,477 --> 00:42:44,061
She's busy with the house.

595
00:42:44,938 --> 00:42:46,521
What doing?

596
00:42:46,606 --> 00:42:49,233
I thought it was supposed to be
a new house, you said.

597
00:42:49,317 --> 00:42:50,567
Stenciling.

598
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:54,196
- What, drawing?
- No.

599
00:42:54,906 --> 00:42:58,242
Stencils on the wall. Decorating.

600
00:42:58,326 --> 00:43:00,285
You must have seen it in magazines.

601
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:02,454
It's very effective.

602
00:43:07,085 --> 00:43:08,585
Roxanne not in, then?

603
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:12,506
She's got some bloke in tow.

604
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:15,592
- Has she?
- Shifty-looking bleeder.

605
00:43:15,677 --> 00:43:17,970
Walks like a crab.

606
00:43:18,054 --> 00:43:19,763
- Your tea's there.
- Ta.

607
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:21,390
Do you want a sandwich?

608
00:43:21,474 --> 00:43:24,101
No, thanks. Is that what you're having?

609
00:43:24,185 --> 00:43:26,144
I only see her first thing in the morning.

610
00:43:26,229 --> 00:43:29,314
She comes in, grunts,
then buggers off to work.

611
00:43:29,399 --> 00:43:31,275
You should be glad she's got a fella.

612
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:34,319
I am glad, Maurice!
I want her to be happy.

613
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:38,740
But I'd like her to bring him round,
see who she's knocking about with.

614
00:43:38,825 --> 00:43:39,950
Just give her a bit of time.

615
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:42,160
You used to bring your girlfriends home.

616
00:43:42,245 --> 00:43:45,163
Front of the telly, laugh, drink.

617
00:43:45,248 --> 00:43:47,708
You didn't mind me sitting there, did you?

618
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:52,462
- What's her name? Never stopped talking.
- Tina.

619
00:43:52,547 --> 00:43:54,089
Tina.

620
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:55,924
And the other one,
wouldn't open her mouth.

621
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:00,721
- Maxine.
- That's it.

622
00:44:00,805 --> 00:44:03,390
Dad liked her, didn't he?

623
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:05,475
Nice thighs.

624
00:44:07,312 --> 00:44:08,854
So how's work, then?

625
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:12,441
Is it at the same place?

626
00:44:12,525 --> 00:44:14,109
Yeah.

627
00:44:14,193 --> 00:44:16,361
I gotta get her
something for her birthday.

628
00:44:16,446 --> 00:44:18,739
- It's her 21st, Maurice.
- August the 7th.

629
00:44:18,823 --> 00:44:20,532
I don't know what she wants.

630
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:24,077
- Apart from me under a bus.
- That's silly talk.

631
00:44:24,162 --> 00:44:25,287
Me head in the oven.

632
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:30,042
When you gonna come and see us, then?

633
00:44:30,126 --> 00:44:33,128
- Eh?
- You know, a bit of a get-together.

634
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:35,672
You can come on Roxanne's birthday.
We'll have some champagne.

635
00:44:35,757 --> 00:44:38,842
- What about Monica?
- She'll be there.

636
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:40,552
Won't she mind?

637
00:44:41,721 --> 00:44:42,888
No.

638
00:44:43,556 --> 00:44:46,266
- It's her idea, actually.
- Oh.

639
00:44:46,351 --> 00:44:49,019
- How do you fancy a barbecue?
- If you like.

640
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:51,104
Anyway, it's about time you saw the house.

641
00:44:51,189 --> 00:44:53,482
- Thought you was never gonna ask.
- I'm asking you now.

642
00:44:53,566 --> 00:44:56,777
- You've been there nearly a 12-month.
- Tell Roxanne.

643
00:44:57,487 --> 00:44:59,029
She might not want to come.

644
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:01,490
She'll say no just to spite me.

645
00:45:01,574 --> 00:45:03,408
Yeah, well, I demand her presence.

646
00:45:03,493 --> 00:45:05,494
- Tell her.
- What if she wants to bring him?

647
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:11,708
- Has he got a job, this bloke?
- Scaffolding, she says.

648
00:45:11,793 --> 00:45:13,001
Oh.

649
00:45:14,295 --> 00:45:16,380
That's very well paid.

650
00:45:16,464 --> 00:45:18,548
- Is it?
- Yup.

651
00:45:23,471 --> 00:45:24,971
Twenty-one.

652
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:29,935
I can't believe it, Maurice.

653
00:45:30,019 --> 00:45:32,896
I was carrying her
when I was 21, wasn't I?

654
00:45:36,401 --> 00:45:39,569
You was good with nappies.

655
00:45:39,654 --> 00:45:41,738
Those safety pins, though. Ooh.

656
00:45:41,823 --> 00:45:43,698
Never stabbed her though,
did you, darling?

657
00:45:43,783 --> 00:45:45,242
Stabbed meself a couple of times.

658
00:45:45,326 --> 00:45:47,327
Seventeen, weren't you?

659
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:51,957
I was.

660
00:46:22,071 --> 00:46:24,030
The place is still standing, then?

661
00:46:24,115 --> 00:46:27,492
Not for much longer.
You should see Dad's room.

662
00:46:27,577 --> 00:46:30,662
- What's up with it?
- It's like the Niagara Falls up there.

663
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:33,290
- What's it got, a leak?
- Yeah.

664
00:46:33,374 --> 00:46:35,125
Only when it's raining.

665
00:46:36,169 --> 00:46:37,419
I'll have a look.

666
00:46:41,257 --> 00:46:44,050
Nice to have a man about the place.

667
00:46:48,306 --> 00:46:50,557
Wish I had known you was coming.

668
00:47:01,986 --> 00:47:04,029
It's dry at the moment.

669
00:47:04,113 --> 00:47:06,239
The whole lot's gonna come down.

670
00:47:08,993 --> 00:47:11,703
Yeah, these look a bit dodgy,
I have to admit.

671
00:47:13,039 --> 00:47:15,081
- Are you up to date on the rent?
- Of course I am!

672
00:47:15,166 --> 00:47:17,936
Give him a ring, get him to do something
about it. It's his responsibility.

673
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:21,880
Don't be daft, Maurice.
He don't give a toss, does he?

674
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:24,633
I'll get someone to look at it.
And I'll pay.

675
00:47:29,055 --> 00:47:30,722
Look at all this junk.

676
00:47:32,475 --> 00:47:34,100
What you gonna do with it?

677
00:47:42,026 --> 00:47:44,361
Give us a cuddle, Maurice.

678
00:47:46,906 --> 00:47:49,908
Please, sweetheart.

679
00:47:57,083 --> 00:48:00,627
Why have you left it so bloody long?

680
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:05,924
Well, you know, it's ̶̶ it's work and ̶̶

681
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:09,719
There's nothing the matter
with your dialing finger.

682
00:48:09,804 --> 00:48:11,429
Well, you can ring me.

683
00:48:12,098 --> 00:48:14,307
You're always too busy, ain't you?

684
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:21,314
Look, um ̶̶

685
00:48:21,399 --> 00:48:23,066
Look, sit your yourself down.

686
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:26,236
You're the only one I've got, Maurice.

687
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:34,703
You love me, don't you?

688
00:48:37,832 --> 00:48:41,501
Hold me tight, Maurice, please.

689
00:48:43,963 --> 00:48:48,341
Sweetheart...

690
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:16,119
My little brother.

691
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:21,666
Look at you.

692
00:49:24,587 --> 00:49:26,755
That's the good life for you.

693
00:49:34,347 --> 00:49:36,514
When you gonna shave, eh?

694
00:49:38,017 --> 00:49:39,768
Slap your arse.

695
00:49:49,111 --> 00:49:51,154
Why don't you chuck it all out, eh?

696
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:55,241
I mean, look at it.

697
00:49:59,914 --> 00:50:02,332
Some of it hasn't been touched
since Mum died.

698
00:50:03,292 --> 00:50:06,002
Can you use anything, Maurice,
in your new house?

699
00:50:06,879 --> 00:50:08,880
To fill a space?

700
00:50:09,715 --> 00:50:10,924
No, thanks.

701
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:14,886
I thought I might move in here.

702
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:16,471
Front view.

703
00:50:17,181 --> 00:50:19,099
See the world go by.

704
00:50:26,941 --> 00:50:28,358
Remember this?

705
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:34,197
Yeah.

706
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:36,616
That's no use to you, is it?

707
00:50:36,701 --> 00:50:39,202
I don't think so.

708
00:50:39,912 --> 00:50:42,622
You ain't gonna make me
an auntie now, are you?

709
00:50:44,709 --> 00:50:46,334
Sweetheart?

710
00:50:52,967 --> 00:50:54,217
Listen, Cynth...

711
00:51:06,355 --> 00:51:08,022
I'd better be going.

712
00:51:21,495 --> 00:51:24,289
You'll let me know about the barbecue,
then, will you, sweetheart?

713
00:51:24,373 --> 00:51:27,542
Of course I will. Tell her if she
can't make it, I'll give her a clump.

714
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:30,670
- Not before I do.
- Hang on.

715
00:51:37,887 --> 00:51:41,723
- Shall I say hello to Monica for you?
- If you like, sweetheart.

716
00:51:43,559 --> 00:51:45,685
- There you go.
- Thanks, darling.

717
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:52,066
See you.

718
00:51:52,151 --> 00:51:53,318
Ta-ra.

719
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:20,762
What was your mum like when your dad died?

720
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:24,265
- What do you mean?
- How did she cope?

721
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:26,017
I don't know.

722
00:52:26,101 --> 00:52:27,727
Too young to remember.

723
00:52:29,688 --> 00:52:32,607
She just got on with it, I suppose,
like everybody else.

724
00:52:32,691 --> 00:52:34,484
Did you have to look after Craig?

725
00:52:35,778 --> 00:52:38,947
What, you mean like
your big sister looked after you?

726
00:52:39,031 --> 00:52:40,615
No, I did not.

727
00:52:44,078 --> 00:52:47,080
My dad never said a word
about my mum after she died.

728
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:48,623
That's men for you.

729
00:52:48,707 --> 00:52:50,083
I hated him for it.

730
00:52:53,671 --> 00:52:55,630
He must have been in real pain.

731
00:52:59,552 --> 00:53:01,219
Maybe he just couldn't share it.

732
00:53:07,226 --> 00:53:08,893
I didn't know what I felt.

733
00:53:12,815 --> 00:53:14,148
I still don't.

734
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:21,030
Cynthia's antics
couldn't have helped him much.

735
00:53:24,118 --> 00:53:25,243
Do you miss Craig?

736
00:53:25,911 --> 00:53:28,454
- Why would I miss Craig?
- Well, he's your brother.

737
00:53:28,539 --> 00:53:30,874
- He's in Saudi Arabia, isn't he?
- Yeah.

738
00:53:33,794 --> 00:53:36,796
Well, I don't exactly miss him.

739
00:53:38,924 --> 00:53:41,759
Why? Do you miss Cynthia?

740
00:53:46,599 --> 00:53:49,183
Do you think Roxanne's serious
about this scaffolder bloke?

741
00:53:49,268 --> 00:53:51,185
Well, she's only known him
for five minutes.

742
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:54,480
Mind you, I was married
at her age, wasn't I?

743
00:53:55,983 --> 00:53:58,276
I wonder if she knows.

744
00:53:58,360 --> 00:53:59,652
What, about us?

745
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:04,699
- What's there to know about us?
- You know what I mean.

746
00:54:07,995 --> 00:54:09,370
How would she know about that?

747
00:54:09,455 --> 00:54:12,248
- Unless you've told her.
- I haven't told her.

748
00:54:12,333 --> 00:54:14,542
- I hope Cynthia doesn't know either.
- She doesn't.

749
00:54:15,836 --> 00:54:17,170
That's all right, then.

750
00:54:20,424 --> 00:54:23,843
No, I meant if she knows about Cynthia.

751
00:54:23,928 --> 00:54:26,763
- You know, before she was born.
- I don't know.

752
00:54:29,141 --> 00:54:31,225
- I don't know.
- I mean, she's got a half-brother

753
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:32,977
or half-sister knocking about somewhere.

754
00:54:33,062 --> 00:54:35,688
- She's got a right to know.
- That's up to Cynthia.

755
00:54:37,775 --> 00:54:39,442
You'd never say anything, would you?

756
00:54:41,403 --> 00:54:43,988
- Of course not.
- Good.

757
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:48,034
Anyway, she must have told her.

758
00:54:48,869 --> 00:54:51,454
She never told her who her father was.

759
00:54:51,538 --> 00:54:53,122
None of us knew who he was.

760
00:54:55,334 --> 00:54:57,251
- I wonder if she ever misses him.
- Who?

761
00:54:57,336 --> 00:55:00,588
- Roxanne.
- Can't miss what you've never had.

762
00:55:00,673 --> 00:55:01,923
Can't you?

763
00:55:11,016 --> 00:55:13,017
I was gonna kill him.

764
00:55:16,438 --> 00:55:17,480
Poor Cynthia.

765
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:19,941
Saint Cynthia.

766
00:55:23,696 --> 00:55:25,488
- She tried her best.
- Did she?

767
00:55:25,572 --> 00:55:26,739
Yeah.

768
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:30,535
Yeah. She did.

769
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:34,622
She gave me a lot of love.

770
00:56:18,167 --> 00:56:20,084
What shall I tell him if he phones, then?

771
00:56:20,169 --> 00:56:21,335
- Who?
- Maurice!

772
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:24,922
- I don't know. Tell him what you want.
- Are you gonna bring your bloke or not?

773
00:56:25,007 --> 00:56:26,758
- No, I ain't!
- Have you asked him?

774
00:56:26,842 --> 00:56:28,342
No!

775
00:56:28,427 --> 00:56:30,720
- Hello?
- That'll be him now.

776
00:56:30,804 --> 00:56:32,722
- Hello?
- Let me talk to him.

777
00:56:32,806 --> 00:56:33,848
Shut it!

778
00:56:35,267 --> 00:56:37,518
Well, there ain't no one there.

779
00:56:37,603 --> 00:56:40,104
- Might be one of them perverts.
- Sweetheart!

780
00:56:40,189 --> 00:56:42,273
Will you stop going on
about this fucking barbecue?

781
00:56:42,357 --> 00:56:44,901
You're going to see him now, ain't you?
You can ask him!

782
00:56:44,985 --> 00:56:48,863
I don't even know if I want him to go,
and it ain't for ages anyway.

783
00:56:48,947 --> 00:56:50,448
See you later!

784
00:56:51,158 --> 00:56:53,659
- I, Zoe...
- I, Zoe...

785
00:56:53,744 --> 00:56:56,704
- take you, Darren...
- take you, Darren...

786
00:56:56,789 --> 00:56:58,748
- to be my husband...
- to be my husband...

787
00:56:58,832 --> 00:57:01,250
- to have and to hold...
- to have and to hold...

788
00:57:01,335 --> 00:57:03,920
- from this day forward...
- from this day forward...

789
00:57:04,004 --> 00:57:06,672
- for better or for worse...
- for better or for worse...

790
00:57:06,757 --> 00:57:09,383
- for richer or for poorer...
- for richer or for poorer...

791
00:57:09,468 --> 00:57:11,052
... in sickness and in health...

792
00:57:25,901 --> 00:57:29,028
Darren and Zoe
have given their consent

793
00:57:29,113 --> 00:57:32,406
and made their marriage vows
to each other.

794
00:57:32,491 --> 00:57:35,701
They have declared their marriage
by joining of hands

795
00:57:35,786 --> 00:57:38,579
and by the giving and receiving of rings.

796
00:57:38,664 --> 00:57:41,958
I therefore proclaim that they are

797
00:57:42,042 --> 00:57:44,877
husband and wife.

798
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:54,512
Ain't you seeing him tonight, then?

799
00:57:54,596 --> 00:57:56,722
I'm having an early night.

800
00:57:57,641 --> 00:58:00,143
- Keep me company?
- I've got a hangover.

801
00:58:01,562 --> 00:58:03,855
You should stop in more often.

802
00:58:07,276 --> 00:58:10,695
You are looking after yourself with him,
ain't you, sweetheart?

803
00:58:10,779 --> 00:58:13,990
- What do you mean?
- You know, taking care.

804
00:58:15,576 --> 00:58:20,079
I don't want to ask you nothing personal,
darling, but... you taking the pill?

805
00:58:20,164 --> 00:58:22,081
That is personal!

806
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:25,168
Why don't you bring him round?

807
00:58:25,252 --> 00:58:27,378
- Leave it out.
- I'd like to meet him!

808
00:58:27,462 --> 00:58:29,422
I wouldn't know him
if he stood up in me soup.

809
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:30,631
Don't hold your breath.

810
00:58:30,716 --> 00:58:33,759
You don't want to leave it up to him,
darling. Men are all the same.

811
00:58:33,844 --> 00:58:37,096
- Mum!
- I hope he uses a what's-name.

812
00:58:37,181 --> 00:58:39,307
- Condoms.
- Mind your own business!

813
00:58:39,391 --> 00:58:43,019
They can leak! You want to be careful!

814
00:58:43,103 --> 00:58:45,396
You're jealous, ain't you?

815
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:48,149
- Where is he tonight, anyway?
- I don't know.

816
00:58:48,233 --> 00:58:51,194
Most likely out giving somebody else one.

817
00:58:51,278 --> 00:58:54,822
That's how I got caught with you.
Running out of the pill.

818
00:58:54,907 --> 00:58:57,533
- You could have a coil fitted.
- Change the record!

819
00:58:57,618 --> 00:59:00,036
Dr. Mulholland, make an appointment.

820
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:02,288
- You'd suit the sponge.
- Keep your voice down!

821
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:04,957
I've got a dutch cap floating
around somewhere upstairs.

822
00:59:05,042 --> 00:59:06,375
You could have that.

823
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:08,836
Run it under the tap,
bit of talcum powder.

824
00:59:08,921 --> 00:59:11,797
- Where you going?
- I don't have to listen to this!

825
00:59:11,882 --> 00:59:13,257
Sweetheart!

826
00:59:16,011 --> 00:59:17,470
Roxanne!

827
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:21,265
Sweetheart, darling,
I'm only trying to help you!

828
00:59:21,350 --> 00:59:23,309
- Leave me alone.
- I'm your mother!

829
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:24,644
Get out of my room!

830
00:59:24,728 --> 00:59:27,605
It don't matter if you have a little baby.
I'll look after it.

831
00:59:27,689 --> 00:59:30,358
- I ain't getting pregnant!
- I'll give up me job.

832
00:59:30,442 --> 00:59:33,694
- It's nothing to do with you!
- Yes, it bloody is!

833
00:59:33,779 --> 00:59:35,780
I'm not having you dropping it at my door!

834
00:59:35,864 --> 00:59:38,324
- Jesus Christ!
- I'm sorry, darling!

835
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:42,370
Fuck off!
You make me sick, you stupid bitch!

836
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:07,687
Fuck!

837
01:00:41,722 --> 01:00:42,722
Hello?

838
01:00:42,806 --> 01:00:44,890
I'm sorry to trouble you,

839
01:00:44,975 --> 01:00:50,313
but I'm trying to locate a Cynthia Purley.

840
01:00:50,397 --> 01:00:53,524
Yes?

841
01:00:53,608 --> 01:00:55,651
Is that Cynthia Purley?

842
01:00:55,736 --> 01:00:57,194
Yes.

843
01:00:57,279 --> 01:00:59,030
Cynthia Rose Purley?

844
01:00:59,114 --> 01:01:00,364
Yes.

845
01:01:00,449 --> 01:01:03,034
<i>Of 76 Quilter Street?</i>

846
01:01:03,118 --> 01:01:05,828
Yes. What is it you want, darling?

847
01:01:07,414 --> 01:01:08,414
Hello?

848
01:01:10,459 --> 01:01:12,918
<i>Did you want Roxanne? She's gone out.</i>

849
01:01:13,003 --> 01:01:16,505
- No.
<i>- She ain't in any trouble, is she?</i>

850
01:01:16,590 --> 01:01:18,632
No, it's about Elizabeth.

851
01:01:18,717 --> 01:01:21,302
Elizabeth? Elizabeth who?

852
01:01:21,386 --> 01:01:23,012
<i>Elizabeth Purley.</i>

853
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:27,350
Oh! But she's dead.

854
01:01:29,394 --> 01:01:30,770
No, she isn't.

855
01:01:30,854 --> 01:01:33,439
<i>She is, darling. I should know.</i>

856
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:35,024
I should know.

857
01:01:35,108 --> 01:01:39,236
Look, sweetheart, she's me mother.
She went in 1961.

858
01:01:39,321 --> 01:01:42,490
No, I mean baby Elizabeth Purley.

859
01:01:43,158 --> 01:01:44,992
Baby Eliz...

860
01:01:48,372 --> 01:01:50,081
Who is this?

861
01:01:51,083 --> 01:01:54,710
<i>She was born on the 23rd of July, 1968...</i>

862
01:01:55,879 --> 01:01:59,048
<i>at... sorry about this.</i>

863
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:07,556
Yeah, at the Haven,
Wells Grange Avenue, Sutton Surrey.

864
01:02:11,144 --> 01:02:13,813
<i>Look, I'm sorry.
I know this must be a shock to you.</i>

865
01:03:19,796 --> 01:03:22,298
Listen, darling. What is it you want?

866
01:03:22,382 --> 01:03:23,757
I'm really sorry.

867
01:03:23,842 --> 01:03:26,844
<i>You mustn't come round here, sweetheart.</i>

868
01:03:28,555 --> 01:03:30,181
I didn't want to upset you.

869
01:03:30,265 --> 01:03:32,183
<i>You mustn't do that.</i>

870
01:03:32,267 --> 01:03:34,185
<i>And you mustn't phone, neither.</i>

871
01:03:34,269 --> 01:03:36,103
I just needed to know.

872
01:03:36,188 --> 01:03:40,441
Yes, but you can't come round,
'cause no one knows about you, see?

873
01:03:40,525 --> 01:03:43,277
<i>- Right.</i>
- Promise me you won't come round.

874
01:03:43,361 --> 01:03:44,403
Promise me!

875
01:03:44,488 --> 01:03:48,699
Look. I've got your address. If I wanted
to come round, I'd have done it already.

876
01:03:48,783 --> 01:03:51,744
I'm ever so sorry, sweetheart.

877
01:03:52,746 --> 01:03:55,164
I'm a little bit upset.

878
01:03:57,626 --> 01:03:59,877
<i>Promise me you won't come round.</i>

879
01:03:59,961 --> 01:04:01,462
All right, I promise.

880
01:04:01,546 --> 01:04:07,635
Thank you.

881
01:04:08,261 --> 01:04:09,595
Um...

882
01:04:11,431 --> 01:04:13,098
C-Can I meet you somewhere?

883
01:04:14,309 --> 01:04:16,644
Oh, I shouldn't think so, darling.

884
01:04:16,728 --> 01:04:18,979
See, I've got lots of, um...

885
01:04:19,064 --> 01:04:21,440
I've got lots of questions
I want to ask you.

886
01:04:21,525 --> 01:04:23,901
Yeah, well, I gotta go now.

887
01:04:23,985 --> 01:04:24,985
Please?

888
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:36,997
What's your name, anyway? Eh?

889
01:04:37,082 --> 01:04:40,000
<i>- Hortense.</i>
- Hortense?

890
01:04:40,085 --> 01:04:41,377
Yeah.

891
01:04:41,461 --> 01:04:43,254
<i>Hortense what?</i>

892
01:04:43,338 --> 01:04:44,755
Cumberbatch.

893
01:04:44,839 --> 01:04:48,259
Clumberbunch? That's a funny name, innit?

894
01:04:49,010 --> 01:04:50,469
Yeah, I suppose it is.

895
01:04:54,432 --> 01:04:55,766
Are you on the phone?

896
01:04:56,601 --> 01:04:59,270
Yeah. Uh, do you want
to take my number down?

897
01:04:59,354 --> 01:05:02,147
<i>Oh, I don't think I got a pencil.</i>

898
01:05:02,232 --> 01:05:03,399
I'll wait.

899
01:05:17,414 --> 01:05:18,455
I've got one.

900
01:05:19,666 --> 01:05:22,918
Um, it's 0171...

901
01:05:24,671 --> 01:05:26,422
219 ̶̶

902
01:05:26,506 --> 01:05:28,674
Sorry, 619...

903
01:05:29,551 --> 01:05:31,635
4840.

904
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:34,179
Yeah, ta-ra.

905
01:06:23,063 --> 01:06:24,313
Hello?

906
01:06:25,565 --> 01:06:28,359
- Hello?
- Do you want to meet me or not, then?

907
01:06:28,443 --> 01:06:29,985
Oh, hello.

908
01:06:30,070 --> 01:06:32,321
Yes or no, it's up to you.

909
01:06:32,405 --> 01:06:34,531
Well, yeah, of course I want to meet you.

910
01:06:35,158 --> 01:06:37,534
Well, then...

911
01:06:40,205 --> 01:06:41,622
Are you sure about this?

912
01:06:43,166 --> 01:06:44,583
<i>I mean, if you're not sure...</i>

913
01:06:44,668 --> 01:06:46,919
Where do you want to meet me?

914
01:06:47,003 --> 01:06:48,837
<i>Well, where would you like to meet?</i>

915
01:06:48,922 --> 01:06:52,007
I don't know. Anywhere.

916
01:06:52,092 --> 01:06:54,885
- Not here, though.
- No, of course not.

917
01:06:55,512 --> 01:06:57,012
Uh...

918
01:06:57,097 --> 01:07:00,224
What about outside Holborn tube station?

919
01:07:02,852 --> 01:07:04,144
Holborn.

920
01:07:05,689 --> 01:07:06,897
When?

921
01:07:07,774 --> 01:07:10,067
<i>What are you doing this Saturday coming?</i>

922
01:07:10,151 --> 01:07:13,112
Nothing. I'm never bloody doing anything.

923
01:07:13,196 --> 01:07:14,947
<i>Saturday, then.</i>

924
01:07:15,031 --> 01:07:16,115
What time?

925
01:07:16,950 --> 01:07:17,950
7:30?

926
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:19,618
<i>Half past seven.</i>

927
01:07:20,537 --> 01:07:24,039
<i>Now, listen,
you mustn't phone me here again.</i>

928
01:07:24,124 --> 01:07:25,874
<i>Do you understand me?</i>

929
01:07:25,959 --> 01:07:28,585
Otherwise, I won't come and meet you.

930
01:07:30,630 --> 01:07:32,965
Now, I'll see you on Saturday.

931
01:07:34,634 --> 01:07:36,135
Hello?

932
01:07:36,219 --> 01:07:39,263
Don't even know what you look like.

933
01:07:56,197 --> 01:07:57,698
- Hello, sweetheart.
- What's for tea?

934
01:07:57,782 --> 01:07:59,324
- Got you a bit of steak.
- What for?

935
01:07:59,409 --> 01:08:01,493
- Little treat for you.
- Ain't you having none?

936
01:08:01,578 --> 01:08:03,620
I'll just fry meself an egg.
Do you want a beer?

937
01:08:03,705 --> 01:08:05,497
- We ain't got none.
- I got you some.

938
01:08:05,582 --> 01:08:07,416
Oh, did you?

939
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:10,169
- You going out?
- No, I'm staying in.

940
01:08:18,887 --> 01:08:21,346
I'm gonna have a few early nights.

941
01:08:22,891 --> 01:08:24,558
I've decided.

942
01:09:26,538 --> 01:09:27,996
Excuse me.

943
01:09:28,081 --> 01:09:30,165
- What is it, sweetheart?
- Are you Cynthia?

944
01:09:31,668 --> 01:09:33,085
Yeah. How'd you know?

945
01:09:33,169 --> 01:09:35,128
Hello. I'm Hortense.

946
01:09:36,172 --> 01:09:38,173
What you talking about?

947
01:09:38,258 --> 01:09:40,968
Hortense Cumberbatch.
I spoke to you on the telephone.

948
01:09:42,512 --> 01:09:44,471
- What, that was you?
- Yeah.

949
01:09:46,140 --> 01:09:47,724
Oh, no!

950
01:09:47,809 --> 01:09:49,643
No, sweetheart.

951
01:09:49,727 --> 01:09:51,979
No, darling.

952
01:09:52,063 --> 01:09:54,565
You've been ringing the wrong person!

953
01:09:54,649 --> 01:09:56,108
Cynthia Purley.

954
01:09:56,734 --> 01:09:58,902
Where'd you get my name from, anyway?

955
01:09:58,987 --> 01:10:00,904
It's on my birth certificate.

956
01:10:00,989 --> 01:10:03,490
What you talking about,
on your birth certificate?

957
01:10:03,575 --> 01:10:04,658
It can't be!

958
01:10:04,742 --> 01:10:07,119
It's got your name and your address on it.

959
01:10:10,331 --> 01:10:11,415
There.

960
01:10:12,917 --> 01:10:14,793
No, that's all wrong, darling.

961
01:10:14,878 --> 01:10:17,713
They've made a mistake
down in the offices.

962
01:10:17,797 --> 01:10:20,757
You want to get down there,
get that sorted.

963
01:10:21,718 --> 01:10:24,720
- That's someone having a joke.
- I don't think so.

964
01:10:25,513 --> 01:10:27,598
Let me have a look at that.

965
01:10:34,522 --> 01:10:37,524
I'm ever so sorry, sweetheart.

966
01:10:39,444 --> 01:10:43,864
It must be a bit
of a disappointment, poor girl.

967
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:50,370
Look, I really think you
ought to see these documents.

968
01:10:50,997 --> 01:10:52,873
Why? What is it?

969
01:10:52,957 --> 01:10:57,878
Why don't we, uh, go somewhere
and have ̶̶ and sit down?

970
01:10:57,962 --> 01:11:00,714
No, I think I better be going, darling.

971
01:11:00,798 --> 01:11:03,634
Look, you've come all this way. Please.

972
01:11:05,511 --> 01:11:08,513
Let's go and have
a cup of tea or something.

973
01:11:08,598 --> 01:11:10,807
There's places down there.

974
01:11:12,393 --> 01:11:13,560
Come on.

975
01:11:25,698 --> 01:11:28,742
I hope you find your mum, sweetheart.

976
01:11:28,826 --> 01:11:30,118
You keep looking.

977
01:11:30,203 --> 01:11:32,412
- Go on.
- No, thanks. I don't smoke.

978
01:11:33,289 --> 01:11:34,706
Nor should you.

979
01:11:35,333 --> 01:11:37,626
My daughter smokes like a chimney.

980
01:11:38,252 --> 01:11:40,963
- You've got a daughter?
- Yeah.

981
01:11:44,008 --> 01:11:46,009
Ain't never been in here before.

982
01:11:48,096 --> 01:11:50,764
They shouldn't go
raising your hopes like that.

983
01:11:50,848 --> 01:11:52,182
It ain't fair.

984
01:11:54,102 --> 01:11:55,727
Is this your signature?

985
01:12:01,859 --> 01:12:03,443
This is stupid.

986
01:12:03,528 --> 01:12:06,446
I don't understand it.

987
01:12:06,531 --> 01:12:09,032
I mean, I can't be your mother, can I?

988
01:12:09,117 --> 01:12:11,827
- Why not?
- Well, look at me!

989
01:12:11,911 --> 01:12:13,328
What?

990
01:12:13,413 --> 01:12:16,039
Listen, I don't mean
nothing by it, darling,

991
01:12:16,124 --> 01:12:18,834
but I ain't never been
with a Black man in my life.

992
01:12:18,918 --> 01:12:21,086
No disrespect nor nothing.

993
01:12:22,005 --> 01:12:24,423
I'd have remembered, wouldn't I?

994
01:12:36,728 --> 01:12:39,104
Oh, bloody hell.

995
01:12:44,152 --> 01:12:48,780
Oh, Jesus Christ Almighty!

996
01:13:01,586 --> 01:13:04,838
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

997
01:13:12,972 --> 01:13:15,599
I'm so ashamed.

998
01:13:17,351 --> 01:13:19,144
You shouldn't be ashamed.

999
01:13:25,526 --> 01:13:27,527
I can't look at you.

1000
01:13:30,907 --> 01:13:32,324
I didn't know, sweetheart.

1001
01:13:32,408 --> 01:13:34,951
Honest, I didn't know.

1002
01:13:35,036 --> 01:13:36,286
What didn't you know?

1003
01:13:36,370 --> 01:13:39,122
I didn't know you was Black!

1004
01:13:40,875 --> 01:13:42,209
See, I ̶̶

1005
01:13:43,127 --> 01:13:46,588
I thought they got the dates all wrong.

1006
01:13:48,257 --> 01:13:52,469
All this time, I thought you
was born six weeks premature,

1007
01:13:52,553 --> 01:13:54,012
but you weren't!

1008
01:13:56,974 --> 01:13:58,600
You wasn't.

1009
01:14:07,485 --> 01:14:08,777
Who was he?

1010
01:14:10,196 --> 01:14:12,739
You don't wanna know that, darling.

1011
01:14:12,824 --> 01:14:13,949
I do.

1012
01:14:15,284 --> 01:14:19,579
Listen, I want to be honest with you,
but I can't tell you that, sweetheart.

1013
01:14:19,664 --> 01:14:27,664
I'm sorry.

1014
01:14:35,972 --> 01:14:37,472
Look at you.

1015
01:14:42,353 --> 01:14:46,189
I expect I'm a bit of a disappointment
to you, ain't I?

1016
01:14:46,274 --> 01:14:47,357
No.

1017
01:14:48,359 --> 01:14:50,652
You don't have to say that, darling.

1018
01:14:50,736 --> 01:14:52,028
I know.

1019
01:14:52,738 --> 01:14:56,533
You've been better off without me,
I can tell you that much.

1020
01:14:56,617 --> 01:14:58,952
I done you a good turn.

1021
01:15:01,831 --> 01:15:03,665
Your tea's getting cold.

1022
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:17,846
What's your mum like, then?

1023
01:15:19,515 --> 01:15:22,142
Does she mind you looking for me?

1024
01:15:22,226 --> 01:15:23,685
My mum died recently.

1025
01:15:23,769 --> 01:15:25,854
Oh, I'm sorry.

1026
01:15:27,815 --> 01:15:29,774
What about your dad?

1027
01:15:30,526 --> 01:15:31,860
He's dead and all.

1028
01:15:41,704 --> 01:15:43,246
Are you married?

1029
01:15:43,331 --> 01:15:46,625
No, no, um, I ain't, uh...

1030
01:15:47,543 --> 01:15:49,961
I ain't married, sweetheart.

1031
01:15:56,344 --> 01:15:58,261
- Are you?
- No.

1032
01:15:58,346 --> 01:16:00,889
I'll bet you've got a boyfriend,
though, ain't ya?

1033
01:16:00,973 --> 01:16:02,515
No, not at the moment.

1034
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:05,393
A nice-looking girl like you?

1035
01:16:11,067 --> 01:16:12,567
Have you got a boyfriend?

1036
01:16:12,652 --> 01:16:15,195
I give them all a wide berth.

1037
01:16:15,279 --> 01:16:18,281
They got me into enough trouble
in the past, ain't they?

1038
01:16:48,980 --> 01:16:50,397
You got a job, have you?

1039
01:16:50,481 --> 01:16:52,607
- Yeah.
- That's good.

1040
01:16:54,735 --> 01:16:56,027
What doing?

1041
01:16:56,112 --> 01:16:58,822
- I'm an optometrist.
- Eh?

1042
01:16:58,906 --> 01:17:00,407
I test eyes.

1043
01:17:01,075 --> 01:17:02,200
Optician.

1044
01:17:02,868 --> 01:17:04,536
Oh, yeah?

1045
01:17:06,747 --> 01:17:08,331
Well...

1046
01:17:10,793 --> 01:17:12,877
there's a turn up.

1047
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:16,214
What do you do?

1048
01:17:17,466 --> 01:17:19,426
I work in a factory.

1049
01:17:20,886 --> 01:17:22,345
Do you like it?

1050
01:17:22,430 --> 01:17:24,139
Pays the rent.

1051
01:17:27,435 --> 01:17:29,060
How about your daughter?

1052
01:17:31,188 --> 01:17:33,398
She works for the Council.

1053
01:17:34,442 --> 01:17:35,942
Have you got any sisters?

1054
01:17:36,027 --> 01:17:37,777
No, two brothers.

1055
01:17:38,404 --> 01:17:40,030
Are they, um...

1056
01:17:41,115 --> 01:17:42,282
adopted?

1057
01:17:42,366 --> 01:17:43,658
No.

1058
01:17:45,161 --> 01:17:46,953
What they do?

1059
01:17:47,038 --> 01:17:50,790
One's a computer salesman
and the other one's got his own garage.

1060
01:17:52,251 --> 01:17:56,338
I bet your mum
was proud of you, wasn't she?

1061
01:17:57,089 --> 01:17:58,256
Yeah, she was.

1062
01:17:58,341 --> 01:18:00,300
Yeah, of course she was.

1063
01:18:00,384 --> 01:18:02,260
I'd have been proud.

1064
01:18:14,690 --> 01:18:16,483
Why didn't you want to see me?

1065
01:18:17,568 --> 01:18:21,029
Well, 'cause nobody knows
about you, sweetheart.

1066
01:18:21,113 --> 01:18:24,032
I don't want to upset my daughter, do I?

1067
01:18:25,242 --> 01:18:27,327
I mean, when I was born.

1068
01:18:29,497 --> 01:18:31,122
I couldn't.

1069
01:18:32,708 --> 01:18:34,542
I was too upset, see?

1070
01:18:34,627 --> 01:18:36,878
They wanted me to look at you.

1071
01:18:36,962 --> 01:18:40,882
They wanted me to hold you,
but I couldn't. I just couldn't.

1072
01:18:42,968 --> 01:18:48,306
I didn't know if I was coming or going.
I was only a little girl meself, 16.

1073
01:18:49,433 --> 01:18:51,434
I didn't have no choice.

1074
01:18:53,312 --> 01:18:55,814
If I had seen you,
I'd have wanted to keep you.

1075
01:18:55,898 --> 01:18:58,983
You do believe me, don't you, sweetheart?

1076
01:19:06,409 --> 01:19:09,119
I don't blame you, darling.

1077
01:19:19,213 --> 01:19:21,256
You only just found out?

1078
01:19:21,340 --> 01:19:22,549
No.

1079
01:19:22,633 --> 01:19:24,551
I've known since I was seven.

1080
01:19:24,635 --> 01:19:28,138
- What, your mum and dad told ya, did they?
- Yeah, they did.

1081
01:19:29,348 --> 01:19:31,766
They sound like nice people.

1082
01:19:32,393 --> 01:19:33,601
Yeah.

1083
01:19:34,687 --> 01:19:38,022
My mum told me on the plane
on our way back from Barbados.

1084
01:19:38,941 --> 01:19:40,608
Little girl.

1085
01:19:42,820 --> 01:19:44,487
Was you upset?

1086
01:19:46,782 --> 01:19:49,075
I just looked out at the clouds.

1087
01:20:11,932 --> 01:20:13,892
Haven't you ever thought about me?

1088
01:20:14,685 --> 01:20:17,437
Yeah, of course I have.

1089
01:20:18,314 --> 01:20:21,691
But 'tain't no good
pining over what you ain't got, is it?

1090
01:20:23,235 --> 01:20:24,944
But didn't you think I'd look for you?

1091
01:20:26,155 --> 01:20:29,073
No, I didn't, as it happens.

1092
01:20:30,534 --> 01:20:32,577
Wish you hadn't bothered now, don't you?

1093
01:20:32,661 --> 01:20:34,370
No.

1094
01:20:34,997 --> 01:20:36,539
I'm glad.

1095
01:20:38,334 --> 01:20:41,377
I don't want to disrupt
your family or anything.

1096
01:20:42,254 --> 01:20:44,088
I just had to see you.

1097
01:20:47,176 --> 01:20:48,968
I had to know who you were.

1098
01:20:50,262 --> 01:20:51,387
Listen...

1099
01:20:52,765 --> 01:20:56,392
I want to wish you all the best,
sweetheart, whatever you do.

1100
01:20:57,102 --> 01:20:59,395
And I'll be thinking of you.

1101
01:21:38,185 --> 01:21:39,811
Bit quiet, ain't you?

1102
01:21:40,729 --> 01:21:41,938
What's up?

1103
01:21:43,065 --> 01:21:45,608
- Are you going out?
- Yeah, in a bit.

1104
01:21:46,735 --> 01:21:47,860
You feeling all right?

1105
01:21:47,945 --> 01:21:51,990
Oh, there's nothing the matter with me,
sweetheart. Nothing at all.

1106
01:21:54,994 --> 01:21:57,412
- Did you find anything today?
- Frozen chicken.

1107
01:21:59,290 --> 01:22:01,374
- What, in the road?
- No, in a bin.

1108
01:22:03,502 --> 01:22:05,169
Still cold.

1109
01:22:05,796 --> 01:22:07,255
Some dirty magazines.

1110
01:22:08,882 --> 01:22:10,925
- Do you bring them home?
- No.

1111
01:22:14,555 --> 01:22:16,514
Still, I suppose there are worse jobs.

1112
01:22:20,185 --> 01:22:22,312
Gotta laugh, ain't you, sweetheart?

1113
01:22:25,357 --> 01:22:26,441
Else you'd cry.

1114
01:22:59,099 --> 01:23:01,559
- Hello?
- Is that Hortense?

1115
01:23:01,644 --> 01:23:02,810
<i>Speaking.</i>

1116
01:23:03,395 --> 01:23:04,520
It's Cynthia.

1117
01:23:05,481 --> 01:23:06,564
Hello.

1118
01:23:07,650 --> 01:23:09,734
<i>I didn't think you'd be in.</i>

1119
01:23:09,818 --> 01:23:11,235
I am.

1120
01:23:12,780 --> 01:23:14,822
Well, I just, um,

1121
01:23:14,907 --> 01:23:17,075
wanted to ring up and say...

1122
01:23:17,826 --> 01:23:20,620
how nice it was
to meet you yesterday, that's all.

1123
01:23:21,538 --> 01:23:22,872
Thank you.

1124
01:23:24,291 --> 01:23:26,167
Been thinking about you all day.

1125
01:23:26,877 --> 01:23:28,503
I've been thinking about you.

1126
01:23:29,129 --> 01:23:31,005
Yeah, well, um...

1127
01:23:32,341 --> 01:23:34,342
I just wanted to say that.

1128
01:23:36,804 --> 01:23:38,346
Thank you.

1129
01:23:38,889 --> 01:23:42,141
I don't know what to say now.
Daft, ain't it?

1130
01:23:46,105 --> 01:23:47,397
Got home all right, did you?

1131
01:23:48,565 --> 01:23:49,816
Yeah, thank you.

1132
01:23:59,118 --> 01:24:00,910
What have you been doing today?

1133
01:24:00,994 --> 01:24:03,246
Oh, just out the back sunning meself.

1134
01:24:04,832 --> 01:24:06,249
<i>What you been doing?</i>

1135
01:24:06,333 --> 01:24:07,750
Just chilling out, really.

1136
01:24:07,835 --> 01:24:10,420
<i>- Yeah, hot, ain't it?</i>
- Yeah.

1137
01:24:13,173 --> 01:24:16,259
Well, that's all I wanted to say,
sweetheart.

1138
01:24:18,303 --> 01:24:19,846
Ta-ra, then.

1139
01:24:19,930 --> 01:24:21,681
I'd really like to see you again.

1140
01:24:23,267 --> 01:24:24,934
- Would you?
- Yeah.

1141
01:24:25,018 --> 01:24:26,394
Oh, that'd be nice.

1142
01:24:27,563 --> 01:24:28,980
Do you like Italian food?

1143
01:24:29,064 --> 01:24:31,649
Yeah. Eat anything, me.

1144
01:24:31,734 --> 01:24:33,776
Chinese, kebabs, the lot.

1145
01:24:36,029 --> 01:24:37,905
<i>- What?</i>
- Nothing.

1146
01:24:38,699 --> 01:24:39,699
It's great.

1147
01:24:58,093 --> 01:24:59,927
And...

1148
01:25:00,846 --> 01:25:03,264
Great. Other side, please.

1149
01:25:06,018 --> 01:25:08,186
And...

1150
01:25:08,896 --> 01:25:12,106
Lovely. So if you'd bring
your face round this way, please?

1151
01:25:12,191 --> 01:25:13,441
Can you shut the door, please?

1152
01:25:15,444 --> 01:25:16,736
Yeah, sure.

1153
01:25:22,242 --> 01:25:23,409
Sorry.

1154
01:25:25,954 --> 01:25:27,789
So who did your original photographs?

1155
01:25:27,873 --> 01:25:32,084
My dad, actually, but my solicitor
said that they weren't good enough.

1156
01:25:32,169 --> 01:25:34,504
Do you have a police photographer?

1157
01:25:34,588 --> 01:25:35,797
No.

1158
01:25:35,881 --> 01:25:37,715
I'm just gonna come in a bit closer,

1159
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:40,176
so I hope you don't
suffer from claustrophobia.

1160
01:25:40,260 --> 01:25:41,761
No, I don't, actually.

1161
01:25:41,845 --> 01:25:43,221
That's good.

1162
01:25:48,477 --> 01:25:51,145
Okay, so I'm just gonna move your ̶̶

1163
01:25:51,230 --> 01:25:53,314
- Thank you.
- Sorry.

1164
01:25:53,398 --> 01:25:54,565
That's great.

1165
01:25:56,193 --> 01:25:57,902
Okay, and...

1166
01:25:59,488 --> 01:26:00,905
A little bit closer.

1167
01:26:05,953 --> 01:26:07,286
Now...

1168
01:26:08,163 --> 01:26:09,956
I know this isn't very nice...

1169
01:26:11,083 --> 01:26:12,792
but it's gotta be done, hasn't it?

1170
01:26:15,087 --> 01:26:18,130
- I want them to look as bad as possible.
- Of course.

1171
01:26:20,092 --> 01:26:22,802
I lost my job. I was good at my job.

1172
01:26:22,886 --> 01:26:24,345
What did you do?

1173
01:26:25,347 --> 01:26:27,223
I'm a beauty consultant.

1174
01:26:28,725 --> 01:26:31,519
Okay, and if you'd just
bring your chin up. Put it up here.

1175
01:26:31,603 --> 01:26:33,813
Lovely and... that's it.

1176
01:26:36,608 --> 01:26:38,150
So what actually happened to you?

1177
01:26:40,904 --> 01:26:43,281
My seat belt was broken.
I went through the windscreen.

1178
01:26:45,617 --> 01:26:48,035
It wasn't my car. I wasn't driving.
It wasn't my fault.

1179
01:26:49,079 --> 01:26:51,080
- Yeah, you said.
- It wasn't!

1180
01:26:52,958 --> 01:26:53,958
You okay?

1181
01:26:55,127 --> 01:26:56,294
Mm-hmm.

1182
01:27:00,507 --> 01:27:02,174
Did the driver sustain any injuries?

1183
01:27:02,259 --> 01:27:03,759
No, unfortunately.

1184
01:27:04,928 --> 01:27:06,888
He's obviously not in your good books.

1185
01:27:06,972 --> 01:27:09,307
I haven't seen him since.
I don't want to see him, either.

1186
01:27:09,391 --> 01:27:11,225
Life isn't fair, is it?

1187
01:27:12,394 --> 01:27:14,812
Someone always draws the short straw.

1188
01:27:16,607 --> 01:27:18,733
Okay, that's very good. Yeah.

1189
01:27:20,819 --> 01:27:21,861
One more.

1190
01:27:24,448 --> 01:27:26,032
- Here's your receipt.
- Thank you.

1191
01:27:26,116 --> 01:27:28,409
Give us a ring in the morning,
we'll see what we can do.

1192
01:27:28,493 --> 01:27:31,120
- Fine.
- Bye, then.

1193
01:27:31,204 --> 01:27:32,997
Mind how you go.

1194
01:27:35,876 --> 01:27:38,336
Oh, Maurice, that's terrible.

1195
01:27:39,129 --> 01:27:40,880
How'd she do that, then?

1196
01:27:40,964 --> 01:27:42,131
Car crash.

1197
01:27:42,215 --> 01:27:45,051
Oh, she's so lovely.

1198
01:27:45,135 --> 01:27:48,137
- Not anymore, she isn't.
- It's tragic.

1199
01:27:48,221 --> 01:27:50,556
She's getting
some ear hole from that dosser now.

1200
01:27:50,641 --> 01:27:53,392
Oh, he's been looking at me.
Gives me the creeps.

1201
01:27:59,358 --> 01:28:00,608
I don't believe it.

1202
01:28:02,152 --> 01:28:04,445
How much money
do you think she'd get, then?

1203
01:28:05,197 --> 01:28:08,199
- What?
- Insurance.

1204
01:28:08,283 --> 01:28:11,285
Oh, if she's lucky, 15, 20 grand.

1205
01:28:11,370 --> 01:28:13,496
Don't know what I'd do
if it happened to me.

1206
01:28:14,581 --> 01:28:16,415
Think I'd kill meself.

1207
01:28:23,924 --> 01:28:25,758
- Hello.
- Hiya.

1208
01:28:25,842 --> 01:28:28,386
- Didn't expect to see you.
- Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

1209
01:28:28,470 --> 01:28:29,887
Hello, Monica!

1210
01:28:29,972 --> 01:28:31,138
Hi, Jane.

1211
01:28:32,265 --> 01:28:34,433
Just been for a facial.
I'm dying for a cup of tea.

1212
01:28:34,518 --> 01:28:36,727
- Over there.
- What?

1213
01:28:36,812 --> 01:28:39,105
- That bloke.
- What bloke?

1214
01:28:39,189 --> 01:28:41,273
- See who it is?
- What, by the lamppost?

1215
01:28:41,358 --> 01:28:44,527
Yeah.
It's Stuart Christian, isn't it?

1216
01:28:44,611 --> 01:28:45,861
No.

1217
01:28:45,946 --> 01:28:47,196
It is.

1218
01:28:48,365 --> 01:28:49,740
But he's in Sydney.

1219
01:28:49,825 --> 01:28:50,908
Is he?

1220
01:28:52,327 --> 01:28:54,078
He's coming over.

1221
01:28:54,162 --> 01:28:55,871
Doesn't look very well, does he?

1222
01:28:55,956 --> 01:28:57,206
It's that man!

1223
01:28:57,290 --> 01:28:59,083
It's all right, Jane.
We know him.

1224
01:28:59,167 --> 01:29:01,460
- Do ya?
- What does he want?

1225
01:29:01,545 --> 01:29:02,878
God knows.

1226
01:29:02,963 --> 01:29:06,257
- Well, it's over to you then, buster.
- Thanks very much.

1227
01:29:10,470 --> 01:29:12,013
Hello, Stuart.

1228
01:29:13,015 --> 01:29:15,850
Maurice.

1229
01:29:15,934 --> 01:29:17,351
Long time, no see.

1230
01:29:17,436 --> 01:29:18,728
Yeah.

1231
01:29:19,604 --> 01:29:21,063
How's things?

1232
01:29:21,148 --> 01:29:22,857
Fine, thanks. Fine.

1233
01:29:22,941 --> 01:29:24,108
Good.

1234
01:29:25,068 --> 01:29:26,402
You're looking well.

1235
01:29:27,487 --> 01:29:29,697
- You're still here, then?
- Yup.

1236
01:29:30,741 --> 01:29:31,949
Good.

1237
01:29:33,493 --> 01:29:35,661
I thought we'd lost you to Australia.

1238
01:29:36,329 --> 01:29:37,997
Well...

1239
01:29:41,835 --> 01:29:43,169
How's the wife and kids?

1240
01:29:43,253 --> 01:29:45,421
- Maureen.
- Monica. Haven't got any kids.

1241
01:29:45,505 --> 01:29:47,965
- Haven't you?
- No. She's great, thanks.

1242
01:29:49,259 --> 01:29:51,093
Good on you, mate.

1243
01:30:04,983 --> 01:30:08,194
- You still in the game?
- Look at all this.

1244
01:30:08,987 --> 01:30:10,529
What are you doing?

1245
01:30:11,698 --> 01:30:14,450
It's lost its style, Maurice.

1246
01:30:14,534 --> 01:30:15,993
Has it?

1247
01:30:16,078 --> 01:30:18,037
Looks like a dentist's waiting room.

1248
01:30:23,460 --> 01:30:25,377
I'd kill for a cup of tea.

1249
01:30:26,963 --> 01:30:32,301
If you're 21 or a millionaire, it's great.

1250
01:30:33,011 --> 01:30:37,223
Or you've got nine kids, you're fine.

1251
01:30:37,307 --> 01:30:38,682
Brilliant.

1252
01:30:38,767 --> 01:30:40,226
Open arms.

1253
01:30:41,061 --> 01:30:42,937
But for guys like you and me,

1254
01:30:43,730 --> 01:30:46,482
it doesn't matter
how good you are, forget it.

1255
01:30:48,860 --> 01:30:52,196
But it was an experience,
and now I'm back.

1256
01:30:52,280 --> 01:30:54,365
That's too bad.

1257
01:30:54,449 --> 01:30:56,784
You were full of such big plans as well.

1258
01:30:56,868 --> 01:30:58,494
Well, it's a big place.

1259
01:30:58,578 --> 01:31:01,497
- That's true.
- Too fucking big.

1260
01:31:03,375 --> 01:31:06,544
You're looking as gorgeous
as ever, Monica.

1261
01:31:09,005 --> 01:31:12,007
So, Stuart, you thinking
about setting up again?

1262
01:31:12,092 --> 01:31:13,509
No, forget it.

1263
01:31:14,344 --> 01:31:16,262
Too much of a pain.

1264
01:31:16,346 --> 01:31:18,764
You know what it's like, Maurice.

1265
01:31:18,849 --> 01:31:22,560
You sweat your balls off for years,
you try and make people happy,

1266
01:31:22,644 --> 01:31:24,270
and what do you get back?

1267
01:31:24,354 --> 01:31:25,479
Nothing.

1268
01:31:26,231 --> 01:31:27,231
Thanks.

1269
01:31:32,737 --> 01:31:35,823
And by the way, Stuart,
this is Jane, my assistant.

1270
01:31:35,907 --> 01:31:38,534
This is Mr. Christian,
the gentleman I bought the business from.

1271
01:31:38,618 --> 01:31:39,618
Hello.

1272
01:31:39,703 --> 01:31:41,328
Hiya, Jane.

1273
01:31:43,165 --> 01:31:44,665
I hope he's treating you well.

1274
01:31:45,375 --> 01:31:48,210
- He's all right.
- You can work for me anytime.

1275
01:31:48,295 --> 01:31:50,796
I'm all right where I am, thank you.

1276
01:31:57,721 --> 01:32:00,723
Your wife must have been
sorry to come back.

1277
01:32:00,807 --> 01:32:01,807
Which wife?

1278
01:32:03,643 --> 01:32:05,561
Oh, that bitch.

1279
01:32:06,313 --> 01:32:08,272
She never came out there
in the first place.

1280
01:32:09,733 --> 01:32:10,733
No?

1281
01:32:11,443 --> 01:32:13,360
So where are you living
at the moment, Stuart?

1282
01:32:13,445 --> 01:32:15,029
- Down at Grays.
- Essex?

1283
01:32:15,113 --> 01:32:17,239
Yeah, my mum's place.

1284
01:32:17,324 --> 01:32:20,367
- Must be nice for her.
- Having her boy to fuss over.

1285
01:32:20,452 --> 01:32:21,619
She's dead.

1286
01:32:23,371 --> 01:32:25,497
She died when I was still in Bangkok.

1287
01:32:26,208 --> 01:32:27,666
Oh...

1288
01:32:30,962 --> 01:32:33,547
- Sorry to hear that.
- That's a shame.

1289
01:32:34,424 --> 01:32:36,467
Didn't see much of her, anyway.

1290
01:32:38,386 --> 01:32:39,929
It's my dad I miss.

1291
01:32:43,433 --> 01:32:45,226
You win some, you lose some.

1292
01:33:04,913 --> 01:33:07,164
You must have had
some lovely weather in Australia.

1293
01:33:07,249 --> 01:33:08,249
Too hot.

1294
01:33:10,835 --> 01:33:14,255
It's too hot over there,
it's too cold over here.

1295
01:33:28,645 --> 01:33:30,312
Hasn't changed much in here.

1296
01:33:30,397 --> 01:33:31,897
Just a lick of paint.

1297
01:33:33,024 --> 01:33:34,608
Still got the Bronica, then?

1298
01:33:34,693 --> 01:33:35,776
Yup.

1299
01:33:37,487 --> 01:33:41,240
I should have thought you'd be able
to afford a Hasselblad by now, Maurice.

1300
01:33:41,324 --> 01:33:42,449
I can.

1301
01:33:44,703 --> 01:33:46,120
Well off, are you?

1302
01:33:46,204 --> 01:33:48,664
Surviving, mate.

1303
01:33:51,334 --> 01:33:52,459
Yeah.

1304
01:33:53,295 --> 01:33:56,422
You've done very well
out of my business, haven't you?

1305
01:33:56,506 --> 01:33:58,007
My business.

1306
01:33:58,091 --> 01:34:00,676
- No, it's my business, Maurice.
- No, Stuart, no.

1307
01:34:00,760 --> 01:34:03,429
Used to be your business.
I bought it from you. It's my business.

1308
01:34:03,513 --> 01:34:06,015
Listen. This was an antiques shop.

1309
01:34:06,099 --> 01:34:07,850
- That's right.
- There was nothing here.

1310
01:34:07,934 --> 01:34:08,976
That's right. I know.

1311
01:34:09,060 --> 01:34:12,438
I gave you my goodwill,
I gave you my clientele,

1312
01:34:12,522 --> 01:34:14,440
I gave you my fucking reputation.

1313
01:34:14,524 --> 01:34:16,650
You gave me nothing, Stuart.

1314
01:34:16,735 --> 01:34:18,777
With all due respect,
your client list was shit.

1315
01:34:18,862 --> 01:34:19,903
It wasn't.

1316
01:34:20,947 --> 01:34:22,448
I followed it up.

1317
01:34:22,532 --> 01:34:25,993
I wrote to them, I rang them,
I didn't get one bite.

1318
01:34:26,077 --> 01:34:29,371
Now, if there's any success in this shop,
it's down to me.

1319
01:34:29,456 --> 01:34:30,664
That's bollocks!

1320
01:34:30,749 --> 01:34:32,875
No, it's not bollocks, Stuart.
It's the truth.

1321
01:34:32,959 --> 01:34:35,461
- How many weddings do you do?
- Oh, enough.

1322
01:34:35,545 --> 01:34:38,047
- How many?
- Oh, about 40 a year.

1323
01:34:38,131 --> 01:34:40,466
- I used to do 140.
- What, personally?

1324
01:34:40,550 --> 01:34:43,260
No, not personally, no.
Nobody does them personally.

1325
01:34:43,345 --> 01:34:45,637
- I do.
- Well, then, you're a bloody fool.

1326
01:34:45,722 --> 01:34:47,848
You get people in, get them out there.

1327
01:34:47,932 --> 01:34:50,601
If the work's there, take it.
You gotta grab it while you can.

1328
01:34:50,685 --> 01:34:52,485
It's not in my interest
to get some tosser in.

1329
01:34:52,562 --> 01:34:55,356
I mean, I'll have no control.
He could fuck up my reputation.

1330
01:34:55,440 --> 01:34:56,982
I'm not a tosser!

1331
01:34:57,067 --> 01:34:59,193
- I didn't say you were.
- I'm not a fucking tosser!

1332
01:34:59,277 --> 01:35:00,444
I'm not talking about you.

1333
01:35:00,528 --> 01:35:03,008
- Don't call me a tosser!
- I wasn't talking about you, Stuart!

1334
01:35:04,532 --> 01:35:05,949
I can still do it!

1335
01:35:07,577 --> 01:35:09,203
I've still got an eye.

1336
01:35:10,205 --> 01:35:11,789
They can't teach you that.

1337
01:35:13,416 --> 01:35:15,125
I'm still a photographer!

1338
01:35:15,960 --> 01:35:17,127
Of course you are.

1339
01:35:22,842 --> 01:35:25,010
So if you want someone to help you out,

1340
01:35:25,845 --> 01:35:27,304
no worries, mate.

1341
01:35:32,602 --> 01:35:33,894
I'll be all right.

1342
01:35:34,521 --> 01:35:36,021
Right. Right, right.

1343
01:35:36,815 --> 01:35:39,316
I see what you're saying, Stuart, yeah.

1344
01:35:39,401 --> 01:35:40,901
I'll bear it in mind.

1345
01:35:40,985 --> 01:35:42,528
You can lend me a camera.

1346
01:35:42,612 --> 01:35:43,821
Yeah, sure.

1347
01:35:44,781 --> 01:35:46,323
I had mine nicked.

1348
01:35:53,915 --> 01:35:55,040
Yeah, great.

1349
01:35:57,836 --> 01:35:59,294
Thanks.

1350
01:35:59,379 --> 01:36:00,629
Sure.

1351
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:15,269
I thought we were
never gonna get rid of him.

1352
01:36:16,229 --> 01:36:18,147
There but for the grace of God.

1353
01:36:41,588 --> 01:36:43,255
Tea's on the table!

1354
01:36:43,339 --> 01:36:44,756
All right.

1355
01:36:51,848 --> 01:36:54,766
- Ain't you having none?
- No.

1356
01:36:54,851 --> 01:36:56,393
Why not?

1357
01:36:59,689 --> 01:37:01,023
I'm going out.

1358
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:03,817
Where are you going?

1359
01:37:08,364 --> 01:37:10,032
I'm off now then, sweetheart.

1360
01:37:10,116 --> 01:37:11,658
Ain't you gonna tell me where?

1361
01:37:11,743 --> 01:37:13,494
You never tell me where you're going.

1362
01:37:13,578 --> 01:37:15,037
You don't never go nowhere.

1363
01:37:15,121 --> 01:37:16,997
Well, I'm going somewhere tonight.

1364
01:37:17,081 --> 01:37:18,832
- Ta-ra.
- Have fun.

1365
01:37:18,917 --> 01:37:20,459
Don't wait up.

1366
01:37:26,424 --> 01:37:28,759
She's been acting right funny.

1367
01:37:28,843 --> 01:37:31,720
- Where's she gone?
- Who the fuck knows? She won't tell us.

1368
01:37:32,514 --> 01:37:34,181
He's all right, though, Maurice.

1369
01:37:34,265 --> 01:37:36,266
He's always got plenty
of wine in and that.

1370
01:37:36,351 --> 01:37:38,769
- We'll get well pissed.
- Yeah, nice one.

1371
01:37:43,691 --> 01:37:46,735
I'm a little bit shy of you,
to tell you the truth, sweetheart.

1372
01:37:46,819 --> 01:37:48,904
Of me? Oh, you shouldn't be.

1373
01:37:48,988 --> 01:37:51,782
And look at you, sitting there.

1374
01:37:52,450 --> 01:37:55,244
- You look like a model.
- Oh, do I?

1375
01:37:55,328 --> 01:37:57,955
I bet you was a pretty little girl.
Weren't you?

1376
01:37:58,039 --> 01:37:59,581
Yeah, lovely.

1377
01:38:01,834 --> 01:38:05,587
Don't do that. You'll stay like it.

1378
01:38:06,256 --> 01:38:09,174
Stop it! Don't spoil it.

1379
01:38:10,843 --> 01:38:13,303
I used to drive my mum mad pulling faces.

1380
01:38:13,388 --> 01:38:16,181
Did you? Bet she was a laugh, wasn't she?

1381
01:38:16,266 --> 01:38:17,349
No, not really.

1382
01:38:17,433 --> 01:38:19,226
Thought you said she was a midwife.

1383
01:38:19,310 --> 01:38:20,936
Yeah, she was.

1384
01:38:21,020 --> 01:38:24,523
Oh, I'd like to have been one of them.
I love babies.

1385
01:38:28,528 --> 01:38:30,946
- I'm sorry, darling.
- It's all right.

1386
01:38:32,073 --> 01:38:34,366
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1387
01:38:37,495 --> 01:38:40,455
- Is that all right for you?
- Yeah, it's lovely.

1388
01:38:40,540 --> 01:38:42,624
Wet, innit?

1389
01:38:43,585 --> 01:38:46,211
Where's this food, then? I'm ravishing.

1390
01:38:47,505 --> 01:38:48,922
What?

1391
01:38:53,970 --> 01:38:57,139
I've got so many things I want to ask you,
but I can't remember what they are.

1392
01:38:57,223 --> 01:38:59,600
Nice to have somebody to talk to, innit?

1393
01:39:00,852 --> 01:39:02,811
Give us your hand here.

1394
01:39:05,440 --> 01:39:08,442
God, you've got beautiful skin.

1395
01:39:09,611 --> 01:39:11,570
Right, let's have a look at you.

1396
01:39:12,780 --> 01:39:15,699
- What, can you read palms?
- I used to.

1397
01:39:16,993 --> 01:39:18,285
I ain't done it for years.

1398
01:39:18,369 --> 01:39:20,370
Nobody's interested no more.

1399
01:39:20,455 --> 01:39:23,707
Now, if I didn't know you,
I could see just by looking here

1400
01:39:23,791 --> 01:39:25,667
what a nice girl you are.

1401
01:39:26,377 --> 01:39:27,919
Big heart.

1402
01:39:28,004 --> 01:39:30,547
Oh, you're gonna live
to a ripe old age and all.

1403
01:39:32,050 --> 01:39:33,592
Let's have a look.

1404
01:39:33,676 --> 01:39:35,260
- Couple of kids.
<i>- Wow.</i>

1405
01:39:35,345 --> 01:39:37,846
- Do you want babies?
- I'm not sure, really.

1406
01:39:37,930 --> 01:39:39,264
Oh, don't you?

1407
01:39:39,349 --> 01:39:41,058
Maybe. I don't know yet.

1408
01:39:41,142 --> 01:39:43,226
Yeah, of course you do.

1409
01:39:44,354 --> 01:39:47,606
- What star sign are you?
- Leo. I'm on the cusp of Cancer.

1410
01:39:47,690 --> 01:39:49,232
When's your birthday?

1411
01:39:49,317 --> 01:39:53,987
Oh, it's the 23rd of July, ain't it?
You'd think I'd know that, wouldn't ya?

1412
01:39:56,074 --> 01:39:59,076
- That was the other day, wasn't it?
- Yeah, Sunday.

1413
01:39:59,160 --> 01:40:03,205
Well, why didn't you say nothing
when I phoned ya?

1414
01:40:03,289 --> 01:40:05,374
- It's not a big deal.
- Did you have a party?

1415
01:40:05,458 --> 01:40:07,793
- No.
- What'd you do, then?

1416
01:40:07,877 --> 01:40:11,505
Stayed in, read me book,
had a little drink.

1417
01:40:11,589 --> 01:40:13,215
- What, on your own?
- Yeah.

1418
01:40:13,925 --> 01:40:15,926
Oh...

1419
01:40:16,010 --> 01:40:19,012
Well, happy birthday
for Sunday, sweetheart.

1420
01:40:19,097 --> 01:40:20,972
Aw, thank you.

1421
01:40:22,767 --> 01:40:24,142
You're out now, ain't you?

1422
01:40:25,520 --> 01:40:29,314
- Yeah, in good company.
- With your mum.

1423
01:40:52,588 --> 01:40:55,132
You thought about
having some driving lessons?

1424
01:40:55,216 --> 01:40:57,467
- What for?
- I could get you some for your birthday.

1425
01:40:57,552 --> 01:40:58,927
Don't be stupid.

1426
01:40:59,011 --> 01:41:02,055
Get yourself a little motor. Eh?

1427
01:41:02,140 --> 01:41:03,849
Ain't you going out tonight?

1428
01:41:03,933 --> 01:41:06,560
- No.
- Why? What's happened?

1429
01:41:06,644 --> 01:41:08,270
- You going out?
- Yeah, later.

1430
01:41:08,354 --> 01:41:09,954
- Where are you going?
- Down to the pub.

1431
01:41:09,981 --> 01:41:12,607
- I hope you're taking care of yourself.
- What do you mean?

1432
01:41:12,692 --> 01:41:14,985
You don't want to go
getting knocked up, do ya?

1433
01:41:15,069 --> 01:41:17,028
Don't be so bloody cheeky.

1434
01:41:17,113 --> 01:41:18,613
Not at your age.

1435
01:41:39,969 --> 01:41:42,137
- All right?
- Missed a bit, darling.

1436
01:42:21,385 --> 01:42:22,677
Who's this?

1437
01:42:22,762 --> 01:42:25,013
Oh, don't start with that again.

1438
01:42:26,182 --> 01:42:27,808
Come on. Who is it?

1439
01:42:27,892 --> 01:42:29,601
- 'Tain't me, is it?
- No.

1440
01:42:29,685 --> 01:42:32,103
- Well, who?
- Sylvester Stallone.

1441
01:42:32,188 --> 01:42:36,399
I can't understand a word he says.

1442
01:42:36,484 --> 01:42:37,984
You like looking at him, though.

1443
01:42:38,069 --> 01:42:41,029
No, he ain't my sort.

1444
01:42:41,113 --> 01:42:43,573
- What is your type?
- What, film star?

1445
01:42:43,658 --> 01:42:45,951
- Yeah.
- Marlon.

1446
01:42:46,702 --> 01:42:48,954
I like a bloke with a bit of meat on him.

1447
01:42:50,540 --> 01:42:52,833
What sort of bloke do you go in for, then?

1448
01:42:52,917 --> 01:42:54,125
Hmm.

1449
01:42:55,878 --> 01:42:58,213
Intelligent, sensitive.

1450
01:42:58,297 --> 01:43:00,006
Well, don't you care what they look like?

1451
01:43:00,091 --> 01:43:02,551
Yeah, but they gotta have
something going on upstairs.

1452
01:43:04,053 --> 01:43:06,555
You only have Black boyfriends, do you?

1453
01:43:06,639 --> 01:43:07,681
Yeah.

1454
01:43:11,978 --> 01:43:14,729
How do you look after yourself, then?

1455
01:43:14,814 --> 01:43:16,648
You know, if you don't wanna have babies.

1456
01:43:19,110 --> 01:43:20,485
Condoms.

1457
01:43:20,570 --> 01:43:22,696
Oh, well, you just stop at that,
then, do you?

1458
01:43:22,780 --> 01:43:25,740
- Yeah, it's the best way, really.
- Well, you can't be too careful.

1459
01:43:25,825 --> 01:43:28,076
- Can you, these days?
- You gotta protect yourself.

1460
01:43:30,621 --> 01:43:32,581
It's my daughter's birthday next week.

1461
01:43:32,665 --> 01:43:34,541
- How old is she?
- Twenty-one.

1462
01:43:34,625 --> 01:43:37,419
- Nice age.
- Well, she's your sister now, really.

1463
01:43:37,503 --> 01:43:40,839
- Ain't she?
- Yeah, I suppose she is.

1464
01:43:43,509 --> 01:43:44,759
Does she look like you?

1465
01:43:44,844 --> 01:43:46,136
Yeah, a bit.

1466
01:43:46,888 --> 01:43:49,556
You look more like me than she does.

1467
01:43:50,474 --> 01:43:52,183
We're the same build.

1468
01:43:53,477 --> 01:43:55,520
What are her eyes like?

1469
01:43:55,605 --> 01:43:56,646
Blue.

1470
01:44:00,067 --> 01:44:02,360
My brother's doing a party for her.

1471
01:44:03,321 --> 01:44:05,697
That's nice.
At least it takes the strain off of you.

1472
01:44:05,781 --> 01:44:07,991
Yeah, well, there is that.

1473
01:44:09,327 --> 01:44:10,994
Shame you ain't coming, really.

1474
01:44:11,078 --> 01:44:13,330
- Ah.
- Meet your new family.

1475
01:44:14,373 --> 01:44:16,291
Oh, sweetheart...

1476
01:44:16,959 --> 01:44:19,002
I nearly forgot!

1477
01:44:20,671 --> 01:44:23,673
- Happy birthday for Sunday.
- Oh!

1478
01:44:23,758 --> 01:44:26,843
- Oh, you shouldn't have bothered.
- Oh, 'tain't nothing much.

1479
01:44:32,683 --> 01:44:33,892
Oh.

1480
01:44:33,976 --> 01:44:35,435
Oh, thank you.

1481
01:44:37,063 --> 01:44:38,939
Don't start crying.

1482
01:44:39,523 --> 01:44:41,399
Perhaps I should ask him.

1483
01:44:41,484 --> 01:44:43,443
- What?
- If I can take someone.

1484
01:44:43,527 --> 01:44:45,987
Oh, I don't know.
It's a family thing, isn't it?

1485
01:44:46,072 --> 01:44:47,864
Well, you are family, ain't you?

1486
01:44:47,949 --> 01:44:49,532
I'm proud of you.

1487
01:44:51,911 --> 01:44:54,496
Listen, Maurice, sweetheart,

1488
01:44:54,580 --> 01:44:56,790
I wanted to ask you a favor.

1489
01:44:56,874 --> 01:44:58,667
Go ahead. What's that, then?

1490
01:44:58,751 --> 01:45:00,543
You know the party Sunday?

1491
01:45:00,628 --> 01:45:02,420
<i>- Barbecue, yeah.</i>
- Yeah.

1492
01:45:03,297 --> 01:45:06,675
Can I bring a mate, sweetheart?

1493
01:45:09,553 --> 01:45:11,596
- Hello?
- Is it a bloke?

1494
01:45:11,681 --> 01:45:13,515
<i>Of course it ain't a bloke,
you silly bugger.</i>

1495
01:45:13,599 --> 01:45:15,600
Chance'd be a fine thing.

1496
01:45:15,685 --> 01:45:17,352
<i>Who is it, then?</i>

1497
01:45:17,436 --> 01:45:19,437
Oh, just someone at work.

1498
01:45:19,522 --> 01:45:21,648
We've been out a couple of times,

1499
01:45:21,732 --> 01:45:25,151
and I was meant
to have seen her Sunday, only I forgot.

1500
01:45:25,236 --> 01:45:26,486
<i>Is that all right, then?</i>

1501
01:45:26,570 --> 01:45:29,698
- I suppose so.
- What do you mean, you suppose so?

1502
01:45:29,782 --> 01:45:31,157
That'd be fine.

1503
01:45:31,242 --> 01:45:32,784
<i>Smashing.</i>

1504
01:45:32,868 --> 01:45:35,328
- I have to check it out, though.
- Check it out? Who with?

1505
01:45:36,706 --> 01:45:39,290
Listen, uh, if I don't phone you back,
bring her, all right?

1506
01:45:39,375 --> 01:45:41,209
I don't want to upset nobody.

1507
01:45:41,293 --> 01:45:42,919
<i>No, don't worry.</i>

1508
01:45:43,004 --> 01:45:44,129
Are you sure, then?

1509
01:45:44,213 --> 01:45:46,423
Yeah, yeah, no problem, yeah.

1510
01:45:46,507 --> 01:45:49,634
<i>Okay, then, sweetheart.
Looking forward to it.</i>

1511
01:45:49,719 --> 01:45:52,137
All right, yeah, well,
say hello to Roxanne for me.

1512
01:45:52,221 --> 01:45:54,139
Yeah. Ta-ra, then.

1513
01:45:54,223 --> 01:45:56,266
<i>All right, ta. Bye, Cynth.</i>

1514
01:45:57,351 --> 01:46:01,604
Listen, I spoke to my little brother today
and he says it's all right.

1515
01:46:01,689 --> 01:46:03,815
So do you wanna come, then?

1516
01:46:04,942 --> 01:46:06,234
Oh, I don't know.

1517
01:46:06,318 --> 01:46:08,778
I told him you was me mate.

1518
01:46:08,863 --> 01:46:10,864
I'd still feel a bit awkward.

1519
01:46:10,948 --> 01:46:14,534
<i>Oh, don't be daft, sweetheart.
You'll be with me, won't ya?</i>

1520
01:46:15,369 --> 01:46:16,578
It won't feel right.

1521
01:46:16,662 --> 01:46:18,872
I thought you wanted to come.

1522
01:46:19,540 --> 01:46:21,041
Yeah.

1523
01:46:21,125 --> 01:46:24,252
<i>Well, of course,
if you changed your mind...</i>

1524
01:46:25,421 --> 01:46:27,005
I was looking forward to it.

1525
01:46:27,089 --> 01:46:28,715
Oh, I know.

1526
01:46:29,592 --> 01:46:30,884
What do you think, then?

1527
01:46:31,677 --> 01:46:33,720
- All right, I'll come.
- You're coming?

1528
01:46:33,804 --> 01:46:36,222
- Yes.
- All right then, sweetheart.

1529
01:46:36,307 --> 01:46:38,767
Listen, I'll give you a ring
later in the week

1530
01:46:38,851 --> 01:46:40,451
and give you the address and everything.

1531
01:46:40,519 --> 01:46:41,728
Okay, then.

1532
01:46:41,812 --> 01:46:43,480
<i>Okay. Ta-ra, then!</i>

1533
01:46:43,564 --> 01:46:44,773
Bye-bye.

1534
01:46:49,820 --> 01:46:51,237
Jesus.

1535
01:46:53,824 --> 01:46:56,701
You should have just said yes.

1536
01:46:56,786 --> 01:46:59,954
Making me look like a...

1537
01:47:00,039 --> 01:47:01,664
I can hardly say no now.

1538
01:47:01,749 --> 01:47:03,416
It's up to you.

1539
01:47:03,501 --> 01:47:06,002
I don't know anything about this person,
whoever she is.

1540
01:47:06,087 --> 01:47:08,046
Some new mate.
They've been out a few times.

1541
01:47:08,130 --> 01:47:10,590
Two hysterical nutters.

1542
01:47:10,674 --> 01:47:12,258
I'm just glad she's got a friend.

1543
01:47:12,343 --> 01:47:14,594
I'm gonna have a great time.

1544
01:47:14,678 --> 01:47:16,763
I thought I'd ask Jane as well.

1545
01:47:16,847 --> 01:47:18,973
Anybody else you want to invite?

1546
01:47:19,058 --> 01:47:21,434
I've only got four garden chairs.

1547
01:47:23,312 --> 01:47:26,231
Oh, give us two of them painkillers.

1548
01:47:29,151 --> 01:47:30,360
There you go.

1549
01:47:31,612 --> 01:47:33,363
Do you fancy some fish and chips?

1550
01:47:34,532 --> 01:47:36,366
Don't be sarcastic.

1551
01:47:36,450 --> 01:47:38,701
I wasn't. Sorry.

1552
01:48:09,150 --> 01:48:10,608
Cheers, mate.

1553
01:48:18,784 --> 01:48:20,704
- There's a bell here.
- Don't do that!

1554
01:48:20,744 --> 01:48:22,745
- I've just done the knocker!
- All right!

1555
01:48:23,914 --> 01:48:25,665
Hello there.

1556
01:48:25,749 --> 01:48:27,292
Hello, sweetheart.

1557
01:48:27,376 --> 01:48:29,043
You got here in one piece, then?

1558
01:48:29,128 --> 01:48:31,171
Long time, no see.

1559
01:48:31,255 --> 01:48:33,047
Yes, that's right. Thank you.

1560
01:48:33,132 --> 01:48:35,300
- Hello, birthday girl!
- All right, Monica.

1561
01:48:35,384 --> 01:48:37,886
- Oh, look at you!
- This is Paul.

1562
01:48:37,970 --> 01:48:39,345
- Hello, Paul.
- How do you do?

1563
01:48:39,430 --> 01:48:41,110
Nice to meet you.

1564
01:48:41,182 --> 01:48:42,265
Oh, there's Maurice.

1565
01:48:44,018 --> 01:48:45,643
Now, come away in.

1566
01:48:47,813 --> 01:48:49,731
- Hi, Jane.
- Hello, Monica.

1567
01:48:53,152 --> 01:48:57,488
Oh, this is Jane. Maurice has just been
picking her up from the station.

1568
01:48:57,573 --> 01:49:00,366
Here he is! Hello, sweetheart!

1569
01:49:00,451 --> 01:49:02,535
- Hiya.
- You all right, Maurice?

1570
01:49:04,121 --> 01:49:05,246
I got you that.

1571
01:49:05,331 --> 01:49:07,171
- You didn't have to do that.
- It's all right.

1572
01:49:07,208 --> 01:49:08,499
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1573
01:49:08,584 --> 01:49:11,294
This is Paul. That's Maurice.

1574
01:49:11,378 --> 01:49:13,258
- Hello, mate.
- Ain't you got one for me, then?

1575
01:49:13,339 --> 01:49:16,507
- Yeah, of course I have.
- Hello, darling.

1576
01:49:16,592 --> 01:49:19,719
- Don't kill him.
- You've landed on your feet here.

1577
01:49:19,803 --> 01:49:21,596
Ain't you, Maurice?

1578
01:49:21,680 --> 01:49:23,097
This is Jane, my lovely assistant.

1579
01:49:23,182 --> 01:49:25,141
I talked to you on the phone,
ain't I, Jane?

1580
01:49:25,226 --> 01:49:27,101
- Yeah, that's right.
- Can I take your coats?

1581
01:49:27,186 --> 01:49:28,978
- Yes.
- What do you want to drink?

1582
01:49:29,063 --> 01:49:32,106
- Red, white, rosé, beer?
- Oh, I'll have white, Maurice.

1583
01:49:32,191 --> 01:49:33,858
Oh, thanks a lot. Cheers.

1584
01:49:33,943 --> 01:49:35,860
- Cynth?
- I'll have white please, Maurice.

1585
01:49:35,945 --> 01:49:37,278
- Jane?
- Rosé.

1586
01:49:37,363 --> 01:49:38,446
Okeydoke.

1587
01:49:40,366 --> 01:49:42,492
- Where's the friend, then?
- I have no idea.

1588
01:49:42,576 --> 01:49:44,452
Have you got an ashtray, darling?

1589
01:49:44,536 --> 01:49:46,955
There's one on the coffee table, Cynthia.

1590
01:49:47,039 --> 01:49:48,957
I didn't think you would have given up.

1591
01:49:49,041 --> 01:49:51,626
One of the few pleasures in life, Monica.

1592
01:49:51,710 --> 01:49:54,921
- These are very bright.
- Don't you like them?

1593
01:49:55,005 --> 01:49:57,382
Yeah, I'll just put them in a vase.

1594
01:50:00,427 --> 01:50:02,387
What you got that out there for?

1595
01:50:02,471 --> 01:50:04,138
We like it.

1596
01:50:04,223 --> 01:50:06,849
Well, don't laugh! It's stupid.

1597
01:50:06,934 --> 01:50:08,893
It's one of my early works.

1598
01:50:08,978 --> 01:50:10,144
Miserable little git.

1599
01:50:10,229 --> 01:50:12,313
He was fucking around
behind the camera.

1600
01:50:12,398 --> 01:50:14,315
Oi, mind your language, you little sod.

1601
01:50:16,110 --> 01:50:18,653
- So how's work, then?
- It's all right, yeah.

1602
01:50:18,737 --> 01:50:20,382
- Still enjoying it?
- Yeah, it's all right.

1603
01:50:20,406 --> 01:50:22,759
- When are you going to college again?
- Shut up about college.

1604
01:50:22,783 --> 01:50:24,594
- You're going to college, ain't you?
- No, I ain't.

1605
01:50:24,618 --> 01:50:27,430
- You should do. You got a good brain.
- I don't want to use it, though.

1606
01:50:27,454 --> 01:50:29,289
- Suit yourself.
- Yeah, I will.

1607
01:50:30,499 --> 01:50:33,584
- Paul's a scaffolder.
- Yeah, your mum said.

1608
01:50:33,669 --> 01:50:36,170
- I bet that's hard work, innit?
- Can be, mate.

1609
01:50:36,255 --> 01:50:38,798
- Yeah, especially in the winter.
- That's right.

1610
01:50:41,010 --> 01:50:43,636
I wanted to give it a Mediterranean feel.

1611
01:50:43,721 --> 01:50:46,180
- Well, it's a lovely kitchen.
- And this is the ̶̶ Oops.

1612
01:50:46,265 --> 01:50:49,350
- Oh, it's a big lavatory.
- This is the downstairs toilet.

1613
01:50:49,435 --> 01:50:51,853
Oh, that's handy, isn't it?
'Cause if you're in the garden ̶̶

1614
01:50:51,937 --> 01:50:54,147
Exactly. It's really convenient.

1615
01:50:54,231 --> 01:50:56,816
And I think the peach tones
make it quite tranquil.

1616
01:50:56,900 --> 01:50:58,192
Yeah.

1617
01:50:58,277 --> 01:51:00,778
So you know where it is if you need it.

1618
01:51:00,863 --> 01:51:02,697
Now, excuse me, Jane.

1619
01:51:02,781 --> 01:51:06,075
- This is the garage.
- I thought it was the cupboard.

1620
01:51:06,160 --> 01:51:08,703
- Is that a new car?
- Yes, that's my car.

1621
01:51:08,787 --> 01:51:10,788
What was the matter with your other one?

1622
01:51:10,873 --> 01:51:14,000
Nothing. I'll show you upstairs.

1623
01:51:20,049 --> 01:51:21,632
We'll start with this.

1624
01:51:22,885 --> 01:51:24,761
- Oh.
- There's the tank.

1625
01:51:24,845 --> 01:51:26,721
That's where I keep
my towels and bed linen.

1626
01:51:26,805 --> 01:51:30,016
- Just your airing cupboard.
- Hmm. It's not very capacious.

1627
01:51:30,100 --> 01:51:32,602
And this is Maurice's bathroom.

1628
01:51:32,686 --> 01:51:34,604
It's green! Matches your tank!

1629
01:51:34,688 --> 01:51:37,231
Are these all new carpets,
are they, sweetheart?

1630
01:51:37,316 --> 01:51:38,524
Oh, yes.

1631
01:51:39,985 --> 01:51:41,903
And this is the master bedroom.

1632
01:51:41,987 --> 01:51:44,781
Gosh, it's
more like the bridal suite.

1633
01:51:44,865 --> 01:51:46,324
It's beautiful!

1634
01:51:46,408 --> 01:51:48,826
I have always wanted a four-poster.

1635
01:51:48,911 --> 01:51:51,245
I can see Maurice
thrashing about in there.

1636
01:51:51,330 --> 01:51:52,622
It is a king-size.

1637
01:51:52,706 --> 01:51:54,624
Oh, it's like something
out of a fairy tale.

1638
01:51:54,708 --> 01:51:56,376
I bet this cost a bob or two.

1639
01:51:56,460 --> 01:51:58,002
Well, it certainly wasn't cheap.

1640
01:51:58,087 --> 01:52:00,254
And here's another lavatory!

1641
01:52:00,339 --> 01:52:02,507
Oh, that bathroom's mine. The en suite.

1642
01:52:02,591 --> 01:52:04,342
You've got
the one each, have you?

1643
01:52:04,426 --> 01:52:06,969
- That's nice, ain't it, Jane?
- It's like a hotel.

1644
01:52:07,054 --> 01:52:09,013
We don't want to be
tripping over each other.

1645
01:52:09,098 --> 01:52:11,391
Aw, you've got everything, Monica.

1646
01:52:13,060 --> 01:52:15,645
- So where's this friend, then?
- He's here, isn't he?

1647
01:52:15,729 --> 01:52:17,688
No. Your mum's.

1648
01:52:17,773 --> 01:52:18,940
What you talking about?

1649
01:52:19,024 --> 01:52:22,026
She rang me at the shop and asked me
if she could bring a friend from work.

1650
01:52:22,111 --> 01:52:24,278
- That's the first I've heard of it.
- Is it?

1651
01:52:24,363 --> 01:52:26,489
- Yeah.
- What, she's never mentioned it?

1652
01:52:26,573 --> 01:52:27,990
- No.
- Peculiar.

1653
01:52:28,075 --> 01:52:30,535
That must be who
she's been going out with.

1654
01:52:31,412 --> 01:52:33,329
She's a dark horse, isn't she?

1655
01:52:37,918 --> 01:52:39,460
- Hello.
- No, I'm sorry.

1656
01:52:39,545 --> 01:52:41,379
I'm a friend of Cynthia's.

1657
01:52:42,297 --> 01:52:44,298
Yes. Oh, yes, of course.

1658
01:52:44,383 --> 01:52:46,050
Hello, sweetheart!

1659
01:52:46,135 --> 01:52:47,362
- Hello.
- I thought you were ̶̶

1660
01:52:47,386 --> 01:52:49,512
Come on in!

1661
01:52:49,596 --> 01:52:51,514
That's me mate, Hortense.

1662
01:52:51,598 --> 01:52:53,558
- Hi.
- That's my brother's wife.

1663
01:52:53,642 --> 01:52:55,309
- Oh, pleased to meet you.
- Monica.

1664
01:52:55,394 --> 01:52:57,311
- Hello, Monica.
- But come on out the back.

1665
01:52:57,396 --> 01:53:00,148
- Meet me brother.
- Okay.

1666
01:53:00,858 --> 01:53:03,192
- Can I take your coat for you, um ̶̶
- Hortense.

1667
01:53:03,277 --> 01:53:04,819
- Hortense.
- Thank you.

1668
01:53:07,865 --> 01:53:09,907
This is me little brother, Maurice.

1669
01:53:09,992 --> 01:53:12,201
- Hello. Pleased to meet you, Maurice.
- How do you do?

1670
01:53:12,286 --> 01:53:14,996
Ain't that little, is he? That's Hortense.

1671
01:53:15,080 --> 01:53:16,497
- Hortense?
- Yeah, that's right.

1672
01:53:16,582 --> 01:53:19,500
And this is me daughter, Roxanne.

1673
01:53:19,585 --> 01:53:22,503
Oh, happy birthday. There you go.

1674
01:53:22,588 --> 01:53:24,630
Oh, you didn't have
to do that, sweetheart.

1675
01:53:24,715 --> 01:53:27,633
- It's okay.
- That's Paul, her intended.

1676
01:53:27,718 --> 01:53:29,886
- He ain't me intended.
- Pleased to meet you, Paul.

1677
01:53:29,970 --> 01:53:31,345
- And this is, um ̶̶
- Jane.

1678
01:53:31,430 --> 01:53:32,763
- Maurice's assistant.
- Hi.

1679
01:53:32,848 --> 01:53:34,576
- Very nice to meet you, Hortense.
- You too.

1680
01:53:34,600 --> 01:53:37,280
- That's nice, isn't it, sweetheart?
- What would you like to drink?

1681
01:53:37,352 --> 01:53:39,437
- Red, white, rosé?
- White wine, please.

1682
01:53:39,521 --> 01:53:41,481
- Thanks. That's really nice.
- You're welcome.

1683
01:53:41,565 --> 01:53:44,192
- We'll have it later.
- No, don't waste it!

1684
01:53:44,276 --> 01:53:46,235
I've got some for later
to have with the cake.

1685
01:53:46,320 --> 01:53:48,362
We thought you got lost.

1686
01:53:48,447 --> 01:53:50,364
Well, I took a couple of wrong turns.

1687
01:53:50,449 --> 01:53:52,369
- Did you come by minicab?
- No, she's got a car.

1688
01:53:52,451 --> 01:53:54,118
- That's really nice, that.
- Thanks.

1689
01:53:54,203 --> 01:53:55,369
- There you go.
- Thank you.

1690
01:53:55,454 --> 01:53:57,640
- Who wants a top up?
- I'll have one with you, Maurice.

1691
01:53:57,664 --> 01:53:59,373
- Not for me, thanks.
- You all right?

1692
01:53:59,458 --> 01:54:01,792
- Yeah, so far.
- Would you like a crisp, Hortense?

1693
01:54:01,877 --> 01:54:03,294
No, I'm fine, thanks.

1694
01:54:03,378 --> 01:54:06,088
I only met Paul
for the first time today, Hortense.

1695
01:54:06,173 --> 01:54:07,965
- Really?
- He's a scaffolder.

1696
01:54:08,050 --> 01:54:09,634
- Are you?
- Yeah.

1697
01:54:09,718 --> 01:54:10,968
Another one bites the dust.

1698
01:54:11,053 --> 01:54:13,429
That must be quite dangerous, Paul.

1699
01:54:13,514 --> 01:54:16,224
- Yeah, well, it can be.
- Here, come and lollop over here.

1700
01:54:16,308 --> 01:54:18,142
Do you have to go up really high?

1701
01:54:18,227 --> 01:54:19,560
Sometimes.

1702
01:54:21,480 --> 01:54:25,191
- Just you and the elements, really.
- Ever fallen off?

1703
01:54:25,275 --> 01:54:27,151
- Would you like a crudité?
- Thank you, no.

1704
01:54:27,236 --> 01:54:28,778
- I think I'll wait till later.
- Oh!

1705
01:54:29,404 --> 01:54:31,405
- So you work with me mum, yeah?
- Yeah.

1706
01:54:31,490 --> 01:54:33,324
- Not on the machines?
- No.

1707
01:54:33,408 --> 01:54:35,409
- You coming round tomorrow night, Paul?
- Mum.

1708
01:54:35,494 --> 01:54:37,286
- Well, it's ̶̶
- We're going out.

1709
01:54:37,371 --> 01:54:39,497
You'll come round before then, won't you?

1710
01:54:39,581 --> 01:54:42,041
- Have a drink? It's her 21st!
- It's no big deal!

1711
01:54:42,125 --> 01:54:43,960
Well, I ain't give you your present yet.

1712
01:54:44,044 --> 01:54:45,586
Chicken drumsticks.

1713
01:54:47,130 --> 01:54:49,173
- Do you want some salad, sweetheart?
- Yes, please.

1714
01:54:49,258 --> 01:54:50,299
I'll get you some.

1715
01:54:50,384 --> 01:54:52,426
You doing something
special tomorrow night, you two?

1716
01:54:52,511 --> 01:54:54,053
- No, down to the pub as usual.
- Oh?

1717
01:54:54,137 --> 01:54:55,763
Can we use fingers?

1718
01:54:55,847 --> 01:54:58,224
Use what you like.
Use your feet if you want.

1719
01:54:58,308 --> 01:55:00,101
You've a knife and fork there, Jane.

1720
01:55:00,185 --> 01:55:02,580
- It's a bit late now.
- What do you do at the factory, then?

1721
01:55:02,604 --> 01:55:04,438
This looks really lovely, Maurice.
Thank you.

1722
01:55:04,523 --> 01:55:07,316
- I hope it don't kill you.
- There's salad servers there, Cynthia.

1723
01:55:07,401 --> 01:55:08,943
- You ain't her boss, are you?
- No.

1724
01:55:09,027 --> 01:55:10,587
- Here you are, sweetheart.
- Thank you.

1725
01:55:10,612 --> 01:55:12,966
- Do you want some salad, Paul?
- No, I'm all right, thanks.

1726
01:55:12,990 --> 01:55:16,284
- It's good for you. Make you grow.
- He don't want none.

1727
01:55:16,368 --> 01:55:18,661
What about Jane? Does she want salad?

1728
01:55:18,745 --> 01:55:20,288
Yes, thanks very much.

1729
01:55:21,832 --> 01:55:23,374
What do you do then, Roxanne?

1730
01:55:23,458 --> 01:55:25,668
- I work for the Council.
- What, doing the dole?

1731
01:55:25,752 --> 01:55:27,378
- No, I'm a road sweeper.
<i>- Wow.</i>

1732
01:55:27,462 --> 01:55:28,588
- Are you?
- Yeah.

1733
01:55:28,672 --> 01:55:30,590
- Who's for a potato?
- She's got my plate.

1734
01:55:30,674 --> 01:55:32,694
- Here you are, sweetheart.
- One for you, Hortense?

1735
01:55:32,718 --> 01:55:34,885
- Yes, please.
- Yeah, I'll have some of that and all.

1736
01:55:34,970 --> 01:55:38,472
- Please.
- You do get girl road sweepers, don't ya?

1737
01:55:38,557 --> 01:55:40,683
- Right, burgers and bangers.
- Nice one.

1738
01:55:40,767 --> 01:55:42,602
Yeah, that's your one, Roxanne.

1739
01:55:42,686 --> 01:55:44,687
That's the one with your name on it.
The burnt one.

1740
01:55:44,771 --> 01:55:46,939
- Yeah.
- Potato for you, Paul?

1741
01:55:47,024 --> 01:55:48,733
- Please.
- There's a nice, big one.

1742
01:55:48,817 --> 01:55:50,651
- Here you are, darling.
- One for you, pet?

1743
01:55:50,736 --> 01:55:52,903
- No, ta.
- Shall I do you, Monica?

1744
01:55:52,988 --> 01:55:54,697
I can see to myself, thanks, Cynthia.

1745
01:55:54,781 --> 01:55:56,782
- Why don't you sit down?
- What about Maurice?

1746
01:55:56,867 --> 01:55:59,660
- Who's looking after the worker?
- Don't worry about me.

1747
01:55:59,745 --> 01:56:02,015
- I've been picking all evening.
- Whoops, sorry.

1748
01:56:02,039 --> 01:56:03,748
Your potato's on your plate there,
Cynthia.

1749
01:56:03,832 --> 01:56:06,584
- I'll have some salad.
- Can I have my tongs back, please?

1750
01:56:06,668 --> 01:56:08,169
- Oh, sorry.
- Got butter?

1751
01:56:08,253 --> 01:56:09,378
Yes, just a minute.

1752
01:56:09,463 --> 01:56:11,255
- May I have some mustard, Monica?
- Uh-huh.

1753
01:56:11,340 --> 01:56:14,175
Oh, you like the American,
don't you, Roxanne?

1754
01:56:14,259 --> 01:56:15,509
Yeah, ta.

1755
01:56:15,594 --> 01:56:18,054
All right, I'll just get some salad.

1756
01:56:19,765 --> 01:56:21,885
- Do you want some butter, Paul?
- All right, darling?

1757
01:56:21,933 --> 01:56:24,310
- Yeah, just waiting for the butter.
- There you go, Cynth.

1758
01:56:24,394 --> 01:56:26,937
- Oh, Maurice!
- That'll shut you up.

1759
01:56:27,022 --> 01:56:30,024
Oh? You having a steak, are you, Cynthia?

1760
01:56:30,108 --> 01:56:31,525
Yes, thank you, Monica.

1761
01:56:31,610 --> 01:56:33,611
Well, that'll put hairs on your chest.

1762
01:56:34,905 --> 01:56:37,448
Like some mustard?
Or would you prefer the French?

1763
01:56:37,532 --> 01:56:39,158
This looks lovely, Maurice.

1764
01:56:39,242 --> 01:56:40,868
Right. There you go, mate.

1765
01:56:40,952 --> 01:56:42,953
- Oh, thanks, darling.
- Half a cow for you.

1766
01:56:43,038 --> 01:56:44,914
Fucking hell, look at the size of that!

1767
01:56:44,998 --> 01:56:46,666
Oh, that's ridiculous.

1768
01:56:46,750 --> 01:56:48,542
There's enough there for all of us.

1769
01:56:48,627 --> 01:56:50,544
That'll put some color
in your cheeks, Paul.

1770
01:56:50,629 --> 01:56:52,672
Right. You sure no one else wants a steak?

1771
01:56:52,756 --> 01:56:55,091
- Well, ain't you having one?
- No, he's not, Cynthia.

1772
01:56:55,175 --> 01:56:58,094
- Not allowed.
- Would you like some mustard, Paul?

1773
01:56:58,178 --> 01:57:01,347
- Oh, it's lovely.
- Can't get rid of it, can you?

1774
01:57:01,431 --> 01:57:04,016
Oh, it's a real communal thing, eating.

1775
01:57:04,101 --> 01:57:05,267
Yes.

1776
01:57:06,561 --> 01:57:08,479
This is a lovely house.

1777
01:57:08,563 --> 01:57:09,980
Well, we like it.

1778
01:57:10,065 --> 01:57:13,275
- I'll show you around later if you want.
- Yeah, thanks. That would be nice.

1779
01:57:13,360 --> 01:57:15,069
Yeah, it's brilliant.

1780
01:57:16,321 --> 01:57:18,114
Do you live in a flat then, Hortense?

1781
01:57:18,198 --> 01:57:19,573
- Yeah.
- Yeah, it's her own.

1782
01:57:19,658 --> 01:57:21,409
She's got a mortgage and everything.

1783
01:57:21,493 --> 01:57:23,035
Whereabouts are you?

1784
01:57:23,120 --> 01:57:24,578
Kilburn.

1785
01:57:24,663 --> 01:57:27,623
That's a bit of a schlep, innit?
The Old Kent Road and back every day?

1786
01:57:27,708 --> 01:57:29,583
- I just get on the tube.
- She drives!

1787
01:57:30,919 --> 01:57:32,670
I drive to the station.

1788
01:57:33,964 --> 01:57:35,715
You've got a bedsit, ain't you, Paul?

1789
01:57:35,799 --> 01:57:37,675
- Yeah, that's right.
- Oh, that's a shame.

1790
01:57:37,759 --> 01:57:39,468
Wish I had a place of me own.

1791
01:57:39,553 --> 01:57:41,262
Do you still live at home, then?

1792
01:57:41,346 --> 01:57:42,888
No chance.

1793
01:57:42,973 --> 01:57:45,182
So, do you two work on the same machine?

1794
01:57:45,267 --> 01:57:48,352
No. I'm the only one on slits.

1795
01:57:48,437 --> 01:57:49,645
Hmm.

1796
01:57:52,149 --> 01:57:54,150
Do you choose
your own working hours then, Roxanne?

1797
01:57:54,234 --> 01:57:55,401
Not bloody likely.

1798
01:57:55,485 --> 01:57:57,695
Just biding her time
till you go to college, aren't you?

1799
01:57:57,779 --> 01:58:00,698
- I ain't going to college!
- Hortense went to college.

1800
01:58:00,782 --> 01:58:02,825
Mmm? What did you study?

1801
01:58:03,577 --> 01:58:04,869
Optometry.

1802
01:58:04,953 --> 01:58:06,120
What's that, then?

1803
01:58:06,204 --> 01:58:08,224
- It's to do with the eye, isn't it?
- That's right.

1804
01:58:08,248 --> 01:58:10,291
- Testing.
- Mmm.

1805
01:58:10,375 --> 01:58:13,586
- And you've given it all up now, have you?
- Not exactly.

1806
01:58:13,670 --> 01:58:16,338
What you doing working
in a cardboard box factory, then?

1807
01:58:17,799 --> 01:58:19,800
- I'm doing research.
- Oh.

1808
01:58:19,885 --> 01:58:21,135
That's interesting.

1809
01:58:22,137 --> 01:58:24,013
- What sort of research?
- Medical.

1810
01:58:24,097 --> 01:58:25,431
What, you looking at her head?

1811
01:58:25,515 --> 01:58:28,726
Take no notice.

1812
01:58:29,352 --> 01:58:31,479
There's nothing wrong with her head.

1813
01:58:31,563 --> 01:58:33,564
- Did you go to university?
- Yeah.

1814
01:58:33,648 --> 01:58:35,649
- Did you do a degree?
- Yes, I did.

1815
01:58:35,734 --> 01:58:37,985
She just looks at our eyes, don't you?

1816
01:58:38,069 --> 01:58:40,696
- Yes, I do.
- What for?

1817
01:58:40,781 --> 01:58:44,074
Well, you can tell a lot about people
from looking at their eyes.

1818
01:58:44,159 --> 01:58:45,659
- That's true.
- Can you?

1819
01:58:45,744 --> 01:58:47,495
Windows to your soul.

1820
01:58:47,579 --> 01:58:49,580
That's a nice way of putting it, Jane.

1821
01:58:49,664 --> 01:58:51,976
- It's true, though, ain't it?
- Right, who wants a top up?

1822
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:53,667
- Hortense?
- No, thanks. I'm driving.

1823
01:58:53,752 --> 01:58:55,503
- Yes, please, sweetheart.
- Yeah, Maurice.

1824
01:58:55,587 --> 01:58:57,087
Oi, greedy guts.

1825
01:58:57,172 --> 01:59:00,132
You want to take
a leaf out of her book, Paul.

1826
01:59:00,217 --> 01:59:02,593
- Lost his license.
- All right, Mum.

1827
01:59:02,677 --> 01:59:04,720
Why? Did you have an accident, Paul?

1828
01:59:04,805 --> 01:59:07,431
- I just had one too many, that's all.
- There you go.

1829
01:59:07,516 --> 01:59:09,099
The demon drink, eh?

1830
01:59:09,184 --> 01:59:10,944
Is that who you've been
going out with, then?

1831
01:59:11,019 --> 01:59:14,104
Yes. She thought I'd been seeing a bloke.

1832
01:59:14,189 --> 01:59:16,524
Could have been, I suppose.

1833
01:59:16,608 --> 01:59:19,693
- I can still turn a few heads.
- Turn stomachs.

1834
01:59:20,320 --> 01:59:22,738
Gee!

1835
01:59:22,823 --> 01:59:24,663
Got my fingers cut off now.
I was just playing.

1836
01:59:24,741 --> 01:59:26,242
Do you want one, Hortense?

1837
01:59:26,326 --> 01:59:28,452
Oh, well,
we might as well pop the lot, then.

1838
01:59:28,537 --> 01:59:31,163
- No!
- It's like a bonfire.

1839
01:59:31,915 --> 01:59:39,880
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

1840
01:59:39,965 --> 01:59:43,259
<i>♪ Happy birthday, dear stinker ♪</i>

1841
01:59:43,343 --> 01:59:45,094
Oh, yeah, Maurice, very funny.

1842
01:59:45,178 --> 01:59:47,763
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

1843
01:59:50,350 --> 01:59:52,309
- Nice one, champagne!
- Oh, I need my camera!

1844
01:59:52,394 --> 01:59:54,834
- Did anybody bring it in?
- I did. It's there, Monica.

1845
01:59:54,896 --> 01:59:56,939
- Do you have to, Monica?
- Of course I have to!

1846
01:59:57,023 --> 01:59:59,066
Watch where
you're pointing that, Maurice.

1847
01:59:59,150 --> 02:00:02,111
Right, all under cover? Okay. And...

1848
02:00:02,612 --> 02:00:03,863
Yeah!

1849
02:00:03,947 --> 02:00:07,116
Come on, blow your candles out, Roxanne.
Everybody else, gather around. Come on.

1850
02:00:07,200 --> 02:00:09,470
- Come on, darling.
- All right, Cynth, you tuck in there.

1851
02:00:09,494 --> 02:00:11,078
Okay, Hortense, in there.

1852
02:00:11,162 --> 02:00:13,873
- Right, come around here.
- Hurry up! It's burning me eyebrows off!

1853
02:00:13,957 --> 02:00:15,833
Right, make a wish. One big blow.

1854
02:00:15,917 --> 02:00:17,334
- And...
- Cheese!

1855
02:00:17,419 --> 02:00:19,169
Hey!

1856
02:00:19,254 --> 02:00:21,213
I hope your wish comes true, pet.

1857
02:00:21,298 --> 02:00:23,173
- Here, Roxy.
- Ta.

1858
02:00:23,258 --> 02:00:25,676
- Here you are, Cynth.
- Here you are, sweetheart.

1859
02:00:25,760 --> 02:00:27,887
- That's nice.
- And Paul.

1860
02:00:28,972 --> 02:00:31,140
All right. Cynth again.

1861
02:00:31,224 --> 02:00:34,059
Thank you, Maurice.
Oh, this is living, ain't it?

1862
02:00:34,144 --> 02:00:36,395
Yeah. Thank you.

1863
02:00:36,479 --> 02:00:37,855
One for me.

1864
02:00:37,939 --> 02:00:39,106
All right.

1865
02:00:40,609 --> 02:00:42,443
On you go, then.

1866
02:00:42,527 --> 02:00:44,194
Oh, yeah. Okay.

1867
02:00:44,279 --> 02:00:45,446
Uh...

1868
02:00:47,198 --> 02:00:49,450
I would like to propose a toast

1869
02:00:49,534 --> 02:00:52,578
to Roxanne on her 21st birthday.

1870
02:00:53,371 --> 02:00:56,916
Now it's all legal
and twice as boring for it.

1871
02:00:57,542 --> 02:00:59,585
Mind you, it's been legal
since you were 18 anyway.

1872
02:00:59,669 --> 02:01:02,796
- So I don't know what I'm talking about.
- Happy birthday, sweetheart.

1873
02:01:02,881 --> 02:01:04,131
- Ta.
- To Roxanne.

1874
02:01:05,425 --> 02:01:06,675
Happy birthday.

1875
02:01:13,183 --> 02:01:14,683
- There you go.
- What's that?

1876
02:01:14,768 --> 02:01:17,603
- Book token.
- Don't be stupid.

1877
02:01:21,107 --> 02:01:22,733
Fucking hell, Maurice.

1878
02:01:22,817 --> 02:01:23,817
Thanks!

1879
02:01:23,902 --> 02:01:25,742
Yeah, well,
it's your 21st, isn't it?

1880
02:01:25,820 --> 02:01:27,279
Thanks, Monica!

1881
02:01:28,031 --> 02:01:30,199
Happy birthday, pet.

1882
02:01:30,283 --> 02:01:31,992
Don't spend it all in the one shop.

1883
02:01:32,077 --> 02:01:33,577
Here, happy birthday.

1884
02:01:33,662 --> 02:01:36,455
Wish I'd brought my present with me now.

1885
02:01:37,165 --> 02:01:39,685
You can give it to her tomorrow,
can't you? That's her birthday.

1886
02:01:39,751 --> 02:01:41,669
Don't expect I shall see her tomorrow.

1887
02:01:41,753 --> 02:01:43,921
Are you gonna sit down, darling?

1888
02:01:44,005 --> 02:01:47,591
Yes, come and sit down.
Everybody have some cake. Hortense?

1889
02:01:47,676 --> 02:01:49,760
- Jane?
- Where am I going?

1890
02:01:49,844 --> 02:01:51,220
Anywhere you like.

1891
02:01:52,430 --> 02:01:54,139
Uh, here. Have a chair.

1892
02:01:54,224 --> 02:01:56,725
- Come on the end, Paul.
- Hortense.

1893
02:01:56,810 --> 02:01:58,018
Thank you.

1894
02:02:01,606 --> 02:02:02,773
Where's the bathroom?

1895
02:02:03,400 --> 02:02:05,442
It's just through this way, darling.

1896
02:02:05,527 --> 02:02:08,447
Yeah, it's the door straight
ahead, and the light's on the left.

1897
02:02:34,806 --> 02:02:36,306
She's a nice girl.

1898
02:02:37,058 --> 02:02:38,976
Yeah, she is, Maurice.

1899
02:02:39,686 --> 02:02:41,937
- Seems very pleasant.
- Yeah, she's all right.

1900
02:02:42,022 --> 02:02:44,189
- How are you doing, Paul?
- All right.

1901
02:02:44,274 --> 02:02:46,400
- Is your shirt dried off now?
- Yeah.

1902
02:02:51,156 --> 02:02:52,990
She takes after her mother.

1903
02:02:54,034 --> 02:02:55,117
Does she?

1904
02:02:55,827 --> 02:02:57,161
Do you know her as well?

1905
02:02:58,163 --> 02:03:00,164
Work at the factory, does she?

1906
02:03:01,875 --> 02:03:03,500
You're looking at her.

1907
02:03:04,085 --> 02:03:05,210
Eh?

1908
02:03:05,295 --> 02:03:07,337
She's my daughter.

1909
02:03:13,887 --> 02:03:15,137
What's the matter with ya?

1910
02:03:15,221 --> 02:03:16,722
Maurice...

1911
02:03:17,724 --> 02:03:19,224
it's me daughter.

1912
02:03:20,435 --> 02:03:22,311
Don't be stupid.

1913
02:03:22,937 --> 02:03:25,064
She's had too much to drink.

1914
02:03:28,943 --> 02:03:30,402
She can't be the one that...

1915
02:03:34,282 --> 02:03:35,282
What?

1916
02:03:37,327 --> 02:03:39,661
Hortense, sweetheart...

1917
02:03:41,164 --> 02:03:43,540
she's your sister.

1918
02:03:46,878 --> 02:03:47,920
What?

1919
02:03:49,672 --> 02:03:52,299
That's her half-sister, Paul.

1920
02:04:02,852 --> 02:04:06,438
- You eat the cake, sweetheart.
- Thanks.

1921
02:04:07,690 --> 02:04:09,942
- What's the matter?
- I'm all right, darling.

1922
02:04:15,365 --> 02:04:17,074
I told 'em.

1923
02:04:23,790 --> 02:04:26,333
Tell them who you are, sweetheart.

1924
02:04:30,338 --> 02:04:32,172
It wasn't supposed to happen like this.

1925
02:04:32,257 --> 02:04:35,592
Yeah, well, it has, ain't it?
So you tell 'em. Go on.

1926
02:04:40,098 --> 02:04:41,306
Is it true?

1927
02:04:41,891 --> 02:04:43,392
Yes, it is.

1928
02:04:46,020 --> 02:04:49,982
- You never told her, then.
- I'm sorry, darling.

1929
02:04:50,900 --> 02:04:52,776
Will someone tell me
what the fuck's going on?

1930
02:04:52,861 --> 02:04:55,404
She's your sister!

1931
02:04:58,449 --> 02:04:59,616
Maurice?

1932
02:05:03,246 --> 02:05:04,246
Monica?

1933
02:05:06,166 --> 02:05:08,792
I always said she had a right to know.

1934
02:05:11,462 --> 02:05:14,423
No, Roxanne, sweetheart, darling!
Darling, please.

1935
02:05:14,507 --> 02:05:16,592
Don't touch me or I will smack you,
you slag!

1936
02:05:16,676 --> 02:05:18,218
You fucking slag!

1937
02:05:18,303 --> 02:05:21,471
Ain't it enough you had one bastard!
You had to have two and all!

1938
02:05:21,556 --> 02:05:23,891
Stop it! Roxanne?

1939
02:05:23,975 --> 02:05:25,017
Roxanne?

1940
02:05:26,227 --> 02:05:29,021
Sit down, darling. Sit down, Paul.

1941
02:05:34,402 --> 02:05:37,613
- Cynthia, I think I should go.
- No, I don't want you to go, darling.

1942
02:05:37,697 --> 02:05:39,031
You sit down.

1943
02:05:40,158 --> 02:05:41,617
Eat your cake, Jane.

1944
02:05:42,368 --> 02:05:44,411
You don't half choose
your moments, Cynthia.

1945
02:05:44,495 --> 02:05:47,164
Well, when's the right moment, Maurice?

1946
02:05:47,248 --> 02:05:48,582
You tell me that.

1947
02:05:49,626 --> 02:05:51,626
- Paul, get my coat. We're going.
- Don't go, Roxy.

1948
02:05:51,669 --> 02:05:53,856
- Why didn't you tell me, Maurice?
- I thought you knew.

1949
02:05:53,880 --> 02:05:55,839
- You used to tell me everything!
- I'm sorry.

1950
02:05:55,924 --> 02:05:58,634
- Well, you fucking well let me down!
- Oh, don't say that.

1951
02:05:58,718 --> 02:06:01,053
As for you, well, thanks for the present.

1952
02:06:01,137 --> 02:06:03,597
You've ruined my party
and I hope you're happy!

1953
02:06:04,307 --> 02:06:06,099
Roxy. Roxanne!

1954
02:06:27,247 --> 02:06:31,792
She don't mean it, darling.
She's just a little bit upset.

1955
02:06:49,519 --> 02:06:51,399
- Where are you going?
- I don't know.

1956
02:06:53,606 --> 02:06:56,441
This has all been a bit of a shock,
innit? Hey?

1957
02:06:56,526 --> 02:06:58,860
Look, I don't get it.
Did you know about her?

1958
02:06:59,821 --> 02:07:01,613
I always thought she'd had a boy.

1959
02:07:01,698 --> 02:07:03,338
- She's a slag.
- No, she's not.

1960
02:07:03,366 --> 02:07:06,243
- Yes, she fucking is.
- She loves you. We all love you.

1961
02:07:08,162 --> 02:07:09,830
- Are you coming back?
- No.

1962
02:07:09,914 --> 02:07:11,373
- You've got to.
- Why should I?

1963
02:07:11,457 --> 02:07:14,084
- You've got to face up to it.
- Face up to what?

1964
02:07:19,340 --> 02:07:21,341
She's left her card.

1965
02:07:22,468 --> 02:07:24,636
Oh, well.

1966
02:07:24,721 --> 02:07:25,929
I'll post it on to her.

1967
02:07:26,014 --> 02:07:27,514
I'll take it.

1968
02:07:28,391 --> 02:07:31,191
The state she's in,
you'll be lucky if you ever see her again.

1969
02:07:31,269 --> 02:07:33,979
Oh, you'd like that,
wouldn't you, sweetheart?

1970
02:07:34,063 --> 02:07:36,982
- Would I?
- You've been working at it for 18 years.

1971
02:07:37,066 --> 02:07:38,483
Ain't ya, Monica?

1972
02:07:39,319 --> 02:07:41,945
You turned my father against me.

1973
02:07:42,030 --> 02:07:44,031
You turned my Maurice against me.

1974
02:07:44,115 --> 02:07:45,991
And you turned my daughter against me.

1975
02:07:46,075 --> 02:07:48,702
You'll be having a go
at her next, I expect.

1976
02:07:48,786 --> 02:07:52,247
Sorry about this, Hortense.
You finished there, Jane?

1977
02:07:52,332 --> 02:07:53,874
Why don't you sit down?

1978
02:07:53,958 --> 02:07:57,711
- You've got a short memory, ain't ya?
- What are you talking about now?

1979
02:07:57,795 --> 02:08:01,715
You wouldn't have none of this if I hadn't
given Maurice the money to start with.

1980
02:08:01,799 --> 02:08:04,676
That money wasn't yours to give.
That was your father's insurance money!

1981
02:08:04,761 --> 02:08:07,596
- That money was for me and Roxanne.
- And Maurice!

1982
02:08:07,680 --> 02:08:10,682
And he didn't want none of it
till he come over and talked to you!

1983
02:08:10,767 --> 02:08:12,184
He was entitled to it!

1984
02:08:12,268 --> 02:08:14,686
I was going out cleaning
at 5:00 in the morning,

1985
02:08:14,771 --> 02:08:16,396
coming home, taking her to school,

1986
02:08:16,481 --> 02:08:18,690
and then going out again
to do a full day's work!

1987
02:08:18,775 --> 02:08:20,067
And didn't we know it?

1988
02:08:20,151 --> 02:08:23,779
You've done nothing but spend his money
since the day you clapped eyes on him.

1989
02:08:23,863 --> 02:08:26,782
Well, what are you supposed
to do with money but spend it?

1990
02:08:26,866 --> 02:08:28,825
At least we've made
something of ourselves!

1991
02:08:28,910 --> 02:08:30,035
Oh, haven't you?

1992
02:08:30,119 --> 02:08:33,163
Just you ought to try
bringing up a kid on your own!

1993
02:08:40,463 --> 02:08:43,590
She can't help it.
She's never had enough love.

1994
02:08:44,217 --> 02:08:46,137
- And you've never got on.
- That ain't my fault.

1995
02:08:46,177 --> 02:08:47,677
I know, I know.

1996
02:08:48,638 --> 02:08:50,138
But she needs you.

1997
02:08:51,307 --> 02:08:53,350
- Come on.
- I don't want to.

1998
02:08:54,644 --> 02:08:55,977
What do you think, Paul?

1999
02:08:57,021 --> 02:08:59,022
I think he's right, darling.

2000
02:08:59,107 --> 02:09:01,483
- Do ya?
- Yeah.

2001
02:09:03,194 --> 02:09:06,405
- Well, I ain't saying nothing.
- You won't have to.

2002
02:09:06,489 --> 02:09:08,949
You just have to listen. Come on.

2003
02:09:25,341 --> 02:09:27,634
I'm sorry, Roxanne.

2004
02:09:28,511 --> 02:09:31,138
It just came out, darling.

2005
02:09:31,222 --> 02:09:33,515
I didn't mean to spoil your party.

2006
02:09:33,599 --> 02:09:36,143
- Tell her, Maurice!
- Now, leave her alone, Cynth.

2007
02:09:36,227 --> 02:09:37,477
Just tell her the truth.

2008
02:09:39,730 --> 02:09:41,064
Darling...

2009
02:09:44,318 --> 02:09:47,696
I got pregnant when I was 15.

2010
02:09:48,739 --> 02:09:51,450
And your grandad sent me away
to this place.

2011
02:09:51,534 --> 02:09:53,076
Didn't he, Maurice?

2012
02:09:53,995 --> 02:09:57,998
I didn't know she was
gonna come looking for me, did I?

2013
02:09:59,208 --> 02:10:01,168
But I gotta tell you the truth, darling.

2014
02:10:01,252 --> 02:10:03,044
I'm glad she did.

2015
02:10:04,380 --> 02:10:07,883
It ain't her fault, sweetheart.
She didn't even want to come!

2016
02:10:07,967 --> 02:10:10,719
She didn't want to hurt you
no more than I did.

2017
02:10:12,138 --> 02:10:14,139
Oh, you tell her, sweetheart.

2018
02:10:14,223 --> 02:10:15,640
It's true.

2019
02:10:15,725 --> 02:10:17,350
She didn't want to upset you.

2020
02:10:19,520 --> 02:10:20,812
I'm sorry.

2021
02:10:24,525 --> 02:10:25,567
All right?

2022
02:10:27,778 --> 02:10:30,071
She said you weren't
never gonna come back.

2023
02:10:31,407 --> 02:10:32,657
Who did?

2024
02:10:33,534 --> 02:10:36,661
I never said any such thing.
She's twisted everything as usual.

2025
02:10:36,746 --> 02:10:38,830
Yes, you did, Monica.

2026
02:10:38,915 --> 02:10:41,374
Well, you was wrong, weren't you?
'Cause she has come back.

2027
02:10:41,459 --> 02:10:43,168
- Ain't you, sweetheart?
- Mum.

2028
02:10:43,878 --> 02:10:46,338
I always thought
you should have known, Roxanne.

2029
02:10:46,422 --> 02:10:48,173
You should have told her, Cynthia.

2030
02:10:48,257 --> 02:10:50,550
Of course
I should have told her, Maurice.

2031
02:10:50,635 --> 02:10:54,179
But I didn't think there
was ever gonna be no need to.

2032
02:10:54,263 --> 02:10:56,765
You seem to have told all and sundry.

2033
02:10:56,849 --> 02:10:58,767
Meaning me, I suppose?

2034
02:10:58,851 --> 02:11:01,144
And why shouldn't he?
I am his wife, after all!

2035
02:11:01,229 --> 02:11:03,480
Then why don't you
behave like his wife?

2036
02:11:03,564 --> 02:11:04,564
What?

2037
02:11:04,649 --> 02:11:06,650
Why didn't you give him no kids?

2038
02:11:06,734 --> 02:11:09,129
- Be quiet, Cynthia.
- That's between Maurice and me.

2039
02:11:09,153 --> 02:11:10,589
You're so selfish, Monica.

2040
02:11:10,613 --> 02:11:12,216
You might not have wanted them,
but he did!

2041
02:11:12,240 --> 02:11:13,240
Shut up, Mum!

2042
02:11:13,324 --> 02:11:15,093
- You don't know what you're talking about.
- Don't I?

2043
02:11:15,117 --> 02:11:17,410
- There are things you know nothing about.
- Maurice.

2044
02:11:17,495 --> 02:11:18,537
Like what?

2045
02:11:24,210 --> 02:11:25,210
Tell her.

2046
02:11:30,049 --> 02:11:31,174
Tell me what?

2047
02:11:32,927 --> 02:11:34,511
Why can't you tell her?

2048
02:11:41,644 --> 02:11:43,061
She can't have kids.

2049
02:11:44,522 --> 02:11:45,939
Simple as that.

2050
02:11:46,023 --> 02:11:49,276
She's physically
incapable of having children.

2051
02:11:50,236 --> 02:11:53,029
We've had every test
known to medical science.

2052
02:11:53,114 --> 02:11:55,991
She's been pushed around, prodded,
poked, had operations.

2053
02:11:56,075 --> 02:11:59,869
We've had 15 years of it,
and she can't have a baby.

2054
02:12:01,247 --> 02:12:02,539
I love you to bits.

2055
02:12:04,208 --> 02:12:06,626
But it's almost
destroyed our relationship.

2056
02:12:07,628 --> 02:12:08,962
You know it has.

2057
02:12:12,633 --> 02:12:13,675
There.

2058
02:12:15,344 --> 02:12:16,428
I've said it.

2059
02:12:18,306 --> 02:12:20,348
So where's the bolt of lightning?

2060
02:12:24,478 --> 02:12:26,771
Secrets and lies.

2061
02:12:28,482 --> 02:12:30,817
We're all in pain.

2062
02:12:30,901 --> 02:12:33,028
Why can't we share our pain?

2063
02:12:34,947 --> 02:12:38,033
I've spent my entire life
trying to make people happy,

2064
02:12:38,117 --> 02:12:41,828
and the three people I love the most
in the world hate each other's guts!

2065
02:12:41,912 --> 02:12:44,873
I'm in the middle.
I can't take it anymore!

2066
02:12:55,301 --> 02:12:56,551
I'm sorry, Hortense.

2067
02:12:57,345 --> 02:12:59,054
But you are a very brave person.

2068
02:12:59,138 --> 02:13:01,306
- A very stupid person.
- No, you're not.

2069
02:13:02,975 --> 02:13:06,519
You wanted to find the truth and you were
prepared to suffer the consequences.

2070
02:13:07,813 --> 02:13:09,481
And I admire you for that.

2071
02:13:11,108 --> 02:13:12,359
I mean it.

2072
02:13:51,732 --> 02:13:54,651
You're so lucky, Cynthia.

2073
02:14:08,791 --> 02:14:10,834
Have you really been
working in the factory?

2074
02:14:10,918 --> 02:14:11,960
No.

2075
02:14:13,796 --> 02:14:15,046
What do you do, then?

2076
02:14:15,131 --> 02:14:16,923
I'm an optometrist.

2077
02:14:17,007 --> 02:14:18,174
Hmm.

2078
02:14:21,595 --> 02:14:23,263
Well, welcome to the family.

2079
02:14:29,812 --> 02:14:31,354
Maurice...

2080
02:14:31,439 --> 02:14:33,940
I wish I'd had a dad like you.

2081
02:14:35,317 --> 02:14:36,776
You're lovely.

2082
02:14:46,954 --> 02:14:51,958
His name's Bingham, your father.

2083
02:14:54,003 --> 02:14:55,795
He's from America.

2084
02:14:58,299 --> 02:15:01,426
And I met him on holiday. Benidorm.

2085
02:15:02,470 --> 02:15:04,721
He was a medical student.

2086
02:15:07,433 --> 02:15:11,144
And one morning, I come down
and he wasn't there no more.

2087
02:15:13,397 --> 02:15:15,774
But he was a nice man.

2088
02:15:18,068 --> 02:15:19,486
He was.

2089
02:15:28,662 --> 02:15:31,289
Was my father a nice man?

2090
02:15:31,999 --> 02:15:35,043
Oh, don't break my heart, darling.

2091
02:16:02,238 --> 02:16:03,530
I'm all right.

2092
02:16:22,424 --> 02:16:26,010
Oh, please, Roxanne, sweetheart!

2093
02:16:26,095 --> 02:16:28,012
Please!

2094
02:16:31,350 --> 02:16:32,684
Please.

2095
02:16:38,107 --> 02:16:39,524
I'm frightened.

2096
02:16:41,569 --> 02:16:42,777
Why?

2097
02:16:45,447 --> 02:16:47,240
You don't love me anymore.

2098
02:16:50,202 --> 02:16:51,870
Not like you used to.

2099
02:16:55,207 --> 02:16:57,041
Maurice...

2100
02:17:02,590 --> 02:17:05,133
you don't know how much I love you.

2101
02:17:07,511 --> 02:17:08,553
Do you?

2102
02:17:23,360 --> 02:17:24,986
We've got each other, haven't we?

2103
02:17:41,086 --> 02:17:43,630
Bet you never seen
so much shit, have you?

2104
02:17:43,714 --> 02:17:46,799
You ought to see my mum's house.

2105
02:17:47,885 --> 02:17:49,135
Do you miss her?

2106
02:17:50,054 --> 02:17:51,304
Yeah.

2107
02:17:52,640 --> 02:17:55,475
- Did you get on with her?
- She used to drive me mad.

2108
02:17:55,559 --> 02:17:57,439
That's what they're
there for, though, ain't it?

2109
02:17:57,519 --> 02:17:58,519
Yeah.

2110
02:17:58,604 --> 02:18:00,521
That's me old chair there.

2111
02:18:00,606 --> 02:18:01,814
Ah.

2112
02:18:02,650 --> 02:18:04,651
I always wanted a little sister.

2113
02:18:06,654 --> 02:18:09,447
No, it's just that my brothers
were much older than me,

2114
02:18:09,531 --> 02:18:11,824
so I ended up playing
on my own most of the time.

2115
02:18:11,909 --> 02:18:13,409
Oh, I know what you mean.

2116
02:18:19,500 --> 02:18:20,750
What you laughing at?

2117
02:18:23,921 --> 02:18:26,214
Do you feel like we're sisters?

2118
02:18:26,966 --> 02:18:28,174
I don't know.

2119
02:18:29,093 --> 02:18:30,802
Do you?

2120
02:18:32,805 --> 02:18:35,390
- It's a bit weird.
- Yeah.

2121
02:18:35,474 --> 02:18:38,601
- I don't mind it, though.
- No. Nor do I.

2122
02:18:38,686 --> 02:18:40,812
I don't even know you yet, do I?

2123
02:18:42,773 --> 02:18:45,233
- Do you want to go out one night?
- Yeah.

2124
02:18:45,317 --> 02:18:46,859
Yeah.

2125
02:18:46,944 --> 02:18:50,113
- You can take me to one of your pubs.
- Yeah, all right.

2126
02:18:52,866 --> 02:18:54,784
How would you introduce me?

2127
02:18:55,786 --> 02:18:57,245
As your half-sister?

2128
02:18:57,329 --> 02:18:58,329
Yeah.

2129
02:19:00,332 --> 02:19:03,960
- No, man. Too much explaining to do.
- It's what I'd say, though.

2130
02:19:04,044 --> 02:19:05,586
- Would you?
- Yeah.

2131
02:19:06,797 --> 02:19:10,717
- Yeah. Better to tell the truth, innit?
- Yeah, it is.

2132
02:19:11,593 --> 02:19:13,428
That way nobody gets hurt.

2133
02:19:17,975 --> 02:19:20,309
Here you are, sweetheart. Tea's up.

2134
02:19:21,437 --> 02:19:24,147
Go on, darling. Want a biscuit?

2135
02:19:24,231 --> 02:19:27,525
- No, I'm all right, thank you.
- Sit yourself down.

2136
02:19:27,609 --> 02:19:29,944
- Are you all right with that?
- Yeah.

2137
02:19:31,363 --> 02:19:32,613
That's it.

2138
02:19:38,120 --> 02:19:39,954
Who would have thought it, eh?

2139
02:19:41,665 --> 02:19:45,084
Look at you two, sitting there
like a couple of garden gnomes.

2140
02:19:52,384 --> 02:19:54,343
Oh, this is the life, ain't it?

2141
02:19:54,428 --> 02:19:56,387
Yeah.
