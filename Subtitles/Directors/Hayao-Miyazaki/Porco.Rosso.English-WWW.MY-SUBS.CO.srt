Mr.Rosso! We've got a job for you!
The Mamma Aiutos gang is on the move.

6
00:01:46,939 --> 00:01:50,694
The Mamma Aiutos Gang?
I'm kinda busy here.

7
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,956
We need you to protect one of our
ships carring a fortune in Gold.

8
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:56,164
Is that all?

9
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,251
Well Uh...

10
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:01,000
There's a group of school girls on board too.

11
00:02:02,121 --> 00:02:03,920
That is gonna cost you.

12
00:02:04,081 --> 00:02:05,834
See here Bouty Hunter, no fight gauging!

13
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,575
We've got a contract with you!

Yeah. Yeah...yeah!I'm on it.

15
00:02:10,796 --> 00:02:11,923
Stop the ship!

16
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:14,850
Stop the ship.Or we sink it!

17
00:02:14,967 --> 00:02:17,015
Wow, pirates!

18
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,855
Pirates. Seaplane pirates!

19
00:02:46,133 --> 00:02:49,051
Someday I'm get off my lazy butt
and give this thing an overhaul.

20
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:22,745
Are you seaplane pirates?

21
00:03:22,868 --> 00:03:23,870
Yes. That's right!

22
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,504
So we're hostages?

23
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:26,544
That's right too.

24
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:28,086
Smells like you never bathe.

25
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:29,254
You're real sharp.

26
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:30,759
So cute!

27
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,469
Could use some love.

28
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,432
Hey!Hey! Cmon kids
we're in a hurry.

29
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,723
Boss do we have to
take all 15 of 'em?

30
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:41,518
Yeah it's not nice to seperate
them from their friends!

31
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,662
Ah! Looks like I'm late!

32
00:04:01,907 --> 00:04:06,860
Aka Hearty! The Mama Auito gang has
taken the girls and the gold!

33
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,341
They went that way.
They went that...

34
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:20,845
No, not that way! That's wrong way.

35
00:04:21,677 --> 00:04:24,648
Calm down. I know what I'm doin'

36
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:29,819
That Mama Aiuto gang is so cheap,they'll fly
just of out sight and hide on the nearest island.

37
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:32,192
Just to save money on gasoline.

38
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:39,692
Damn! Don't give out on me now!

39
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:45,994
Cmon Baby...cmon!

40
00:04:48,994 --> 00:04:51,293
Yeah that's my girl!

41
00:05:00,007 --> 00:05:01,884
That can't be good.

42
00:05:02,105 --> 00:05:04,884
I better get this job done quick!

43
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,144
There they are!

44
00:05:20,404 --> 00:05:22,204
What the heck is this? Site seeing plane?

45
00:05:22,425 --> 00:05:28,875
This is Pirate country. They know
better than to be out here!

46
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:31,418
Porco Rosso!

47
00:05:31,747 --> 00:05:35,923
Hey Girls! Get outta here. You get yourselves
kidnapped by these guys, sweethearts!

48
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:41,423
He's so cool!

49
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:56,774
What's this?
Looks like we're safe.

50
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:58,031
Hey look! We're flying!

51
00:05:58,149 --> 00:05:59,071
What's goin' on down there?

52
00:06:01,485 --> 00:06:04,238
Now girls! This is not a playground.

53
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:05,740
Hey! Can't you shut them up?

54
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:09,418
I told you, we shouldn't have taken them.

55
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:10,418
Aah! My nose!

56
00:06:11,161 --> 00:06:14,382
Can we come up?
Yeah alright! Just don't let the boss know.

57
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:18,011
Ah! Great view!

58
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,797
Hey look! What a pretty red plane!

59
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:21,723
What! Where?

60
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:23,432
That was Porco!

61
00:06:23,733 --> 00:06:24,332
Yeah!

62
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:30,644
Alright! Let's get this
thing over with.

63
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:33,980
He's back!

64
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:36,987
It is Porco!
I can't see!

65
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:43,653
That's not good!

66
00:06:43,819 --> 00:06:44,786
Engine stopped.

67
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:45,951
We'll crash!

68
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:48,165
No we're not! We've got another engine.

69
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:55,215
Hey! Don't just sit there,shoot em'
Shoot em'

70
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,127
You keep missing him.

71
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:03,968
I think he's better than you!

72
00:07:11,805 --> 00:07:15,230
Signal from the pig -
“Surrender now! You lose jerks!”

73
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:16,399
Never!

74
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:23,117
Here he comes! I'll get him this time

75
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:26,870
Where? Where did he go?

76
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:28,031
He is pretty!

77
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:44,048
We down. We're going to sink!
Let's get down from here.

78
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:46,841
We aren't gonna sink!.
This is a seaplane.

79
00:07:49,141 --> 00:07:51,942
No! No! No
That's not good

80
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,606
We're sinking.
We're sinking.

81
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:57,439
Hey! Stop em!They are valuable hostage!
Hey! Get back inside.

82
00:07:57,601 --> 00:07:59,855
Girls! Out of the water!
It's dangerous!

83
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:03,574
Don't worry.
We all belong to a swimming club.

84
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:06,156
Watch this!
No! No! No. Don't do it.

85
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:08,245
Signal from the pig!

86
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:11,415
“He says - Hand over the Girls and the Gold...

87
00:08:11,615 --> 00:08:14,716
and I'll let you keep some of the loot
so you can repair your ship"

88
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:17,713
I hate to put you jerks outta business!

89
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:18,831
We get to keep it?
That's generous!

90
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:19,879
Half?

91
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,471
We're not giving you anything!
You idiot!

92
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,471
Eat Lead!Come and get it Pig!
I dare ya!

93
00:08:29,925 --> 00:08:30,927
Gotcha!

94
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,726
It jammed!
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

95
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:46,777
Bye-bye! Bye bye Pirates!

96
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,403
See that went well!

97
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,780
He was nice enough not to kill us.

98
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:53,575
Show more ambition! You are a pirate!

99
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:03,301
Cmon on! Get me!
Hey! Get outta here!

100
00:09:04,793 --> 00:09:07,467
Hey! Don't touch that!
Hey! Get down from there!

101
00:09:07,668 --> 00:09:09,768
Put your pulls back on!

102
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:13,095
Hey! Get down!

103
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,642
Hey...don't touch that.

104
00:09:17,342 --> 00:09:20,412
Another triumph for Porco Rosso!

105
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,611
It's a good thing, we pirate abandoned...
together right?

106
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:26,919
We gotta do somethin'
about that stupid Pig!

107
00:09:27,158 --> 00:09:30,452
So you are an American
who can help us?

108
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:34,394
The pirates of the Adriatic, can't
have an American protection!

109
00:09:34,524 --> 00:09:38,524
That's embarassing! No its not! Look at
him, his grandma's cousin  was Italian.

110
00:09:38,698 --> 00:09:42,299
And besides Curtis is the only pilot
who can beat Porco. And for 10% ...

111
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:46,801
10% ? I'm not gonna pay that!
Shhh!

112
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,100
(Singing in French)

113
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,197
Beautiful.

114
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:30,402
Pig's here.

115
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:35,384
With his snout in the air as always.
Shh!

116
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,298
Mr. Porco Rosso? Congratulations on defeating...

117
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:52,091
the Mama Aiuto gang!

118
00:11:52,216 --> 00:11:56,096
Did you know you took twice the
reward of Bounty Hunter this year?

119
00:11:56,197 --> 00:12:00,000
And Sir, how does it feel to be the
top Bounty Hunter of the Adriatic?

120
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:04,474
And let me ask...Hey, eh!
What do you think you doing?

121
00:12:04,673 --> 00:12:06,474
Get your hands off me!

122
00:12:06,975 --> 00:12:09,070
Shutup and listen to the song!
Yes Sir..

123
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:19,956
She sure is incredible.

124
00:12:20,405 --> 00:12:25,162
I just might have to take her back home with
me. I bet she can make it big in America.

125
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:29,041
Although she'll have to stop singing
in front of each everytime!

126
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:31,500
Hey Cowboy! Is that your plane upfront?

127
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:35,713
Yep. I don't mind saying she made me
bit of a celebrity in the racing world.

128
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:40,139
So you are the one who beat the
Italians in the Schneider Cup?

129
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:43,350
That's right! But what I'm best
at is Aerial combat.

130
00:12:44,179 --> 00:12:48,480
These pirates tell me that you got a
pretty good reputation in the skies.

131
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:51,984
I'd be careful if you're planning on
making a deal with that Pirate Gangs.

132
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:56,697
Not only are they lying cheapstakes,
not a single one of them knows how to bathe.

133
00:12:58,235 --> 00:12:59,032
That's for sure.

134
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,623
Wait! We heard that you stupid pig.

135
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:04,164
Hello.Look at this?
While you handsome pirate bosses are...

136
00:13:04,365 --> 00:13:08,544
in one table, you are not here
to cause problems are you?

137
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:12,424
You know my rule,you eat in my
restaraunt..not fight.

138
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:17,431
Ofcourse, Gina. We would never fight
within 50 miles from your place.

139
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:20,221
We're even getting along with the pig.
Aren't we?

140
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:24,015
Be good boys.

141
00:13:24,177 --> 00:13:25,520
Wish me luck.

142
00:13:32,289 --> 00:13:34,399
May I help you?

143
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:37,908
Porco, tell me about your rescue?

144
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:39,909
Next time just the two of us.

145
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,163
Eating all alone here again.

146
00:13:52,264 --> 00:13:55,213
So what do you think about the American
flyboy? He's something else, isn't he?

147
00:13:55,388 --> 00:14:00,019
As soon as he saw me,
he asked me to marry him!

148
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:03,006
So I told him of the three
pilots I've married.

149
00:14:03,167 --> 00:14:07,236
The first died in the war,second died in
the Atlantic, last one he died in Asia.

150
00:14:09,336 --> 00:14:10,538
So you heard something?

151
00:14:11,868 --> 00:14:16,715
I got the call last night.They found
his remains in some remote part of Bengal.

152
00:14:18,846 --> 00:14:22,485
It's strange Marco. I've been waiting
to hear something for 3 years...

153
00:14:22,649 --> 00:14:24,177
but now I can't even cry.

154
00:14:24,258 --> 00:14:26,076
Just feel numb.

155
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,177
Maybe I've run out of tears.

156
00:14:29,434 --> 00:14:35,355
Well yeah! The good guys always die.
Cheers. To a good man.

157
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,965
Marco I wanna thank you
for keeping an eye on me.

158
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:42,264
And my restaraunt all these years.

159
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:47,975
I can't tell you how much your
friendship means to me.

160
00:14:49,971 --> 00:14:52,125
Well you know, its a great place...

161
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,476
except from that ugly photograph you
keep hanging in the wall up there.

162
00:14:54,695 --> 00:14:59,217
Hey! That's my favorite picture. I can't
believe you scribbled over your face!

163
00:14:59,418 --> 00:15:02,817
That's the only picture
left of you as a human.

164
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,370
How you ever going to break that
stupid curse on you,Marco?

165
00:15:10,817 --> 00:15:12,817
Face it! I'm a pig.

166
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:32,061
That American's gonna be trouble.

167
00:15:46,217 --> 00:15:49,217
Hey, that's Porco Rosso.
Let's alert the captain.

168
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:04,639
I envy you Mr.Rosso. I wish I
could make money way you do!

169
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:06,765
Here's this month's payment.

170
00:16:07,048 --> 00:16:09,302
That the last you owe on the seaplane.

171
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:14,604
Let's see..How about buying some patriotic
bonds to help serve our nation?

172
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:17,565
Sorry I'm a pig. Leave
that to you humans.

173
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:37,000
Hey there,Mr.Rosso.
We got your gun ready.

174
00:16:37,321 --> 00:16:40,318
Give me some ammo too,kid.
Yes Sir.

175
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,465
Lotta commotion in the street.

176
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:48,216
Sure is! Looks like our irons
are in for change in government.

177
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:50,764
If so you Bounty Hunters
will soon be outlaws.

178
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,600
Laws don't mean anything to a pig.

179
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:57,732
That's a good point. Won't mean
much to us weapons dealer either.

180
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,375
Here are the bullets! You
sure you want the usual?

181
00:17:02,575 --> 00:17:05,375
We got the new armor piercing
that explode on contact!

182
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:09,115
Hey! Easy kid. I'm just a bounty hunter.
I'm not fighting a war.

183
00:17:09,477 --> 00:17:11,278
Come again.

184
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:17,044
So whats the difference between
fighting a war and bounty hunting?

185
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:19,288
If you make money from war, you are scud...

186
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,588
but if you can't make money from
bounty hunting you are an idiot!

187
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:28,593
Ah! How in the whole world could
we be in debt.This is ridiculous!

188
00:17:28,713 --> 00:17:30,090
We miscalculated!

189
00:17:30,298 --> 00:17:35,126
We didn't take quite enough
money to cover our repairs!

190
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:36,511
Ah there! The pirates are here!

191
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:45,815
Man! This is embarassing. I can't believe
we have to work with these losers!

192
00:17:46,022 --> 00:17:48,116
It's the stupid pig's fault boss!

193
00:17:48,483 --> 00:17:51,828
Look at that. Those Mamma Aiutos
guy can't even afford paint?

194
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:53,830
Its embarassing to be seen with them.

195
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,834
Alright I guess we're all here.

196
00:17:57,492 --> 00:18:00,336
Hey, you in the back. What
happened to Mr.America?

197
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,631
He's flying in the sun.

198
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,671
Typical American!

199
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:16,892
Sighted target: The Queen of the
Mediterranean at 10 'o' Clock.

200
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:19,352
That ship's kinda big, isn't?

201
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:22,647
That's why we doing this as a group.
Don't be such a sissy.

202
00:18:23,184 --> 00:18:26,984
We're having engine trouble. You go on ahead.
We'll back you up.

203
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:30,152
Don't try to chicken out!
We stick to the plan.

204
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:33,659
We share the cost of repairs,
if one of us gets hit. Right?

205
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:38,166
No you babies! Everyones responsible
for his own expenses.

206
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,667
Even for the ammo? What do you think?
We're having engine trouble!

207
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:43,007
We're having engine trouble!

208
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:49,674
Shut up you sissies!
What guns are firing?

209
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:57,304
Attention all passengers!
We are now being attacked by seapirates.

210
00:18:57,427 --> 00:19:01,353
Please do not be alarmed.

211
00:19:01,973 --> 00:19:05,273
The Queen of the Mediterranean coastline
has anticipated this possibility.

212
00:19:05,685 --> 00:19:09,190
And equipped our ship with
two top of the lines pilots!

213
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:15,491
Now launching from the main desk,
Lane#1 The Black Stallion, Sinor Valleta.

214
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:20,876
And from Lane#2 The Wolf of the Tiber,
captain Visconti.

215
00:19:22,176 --> 00:19:24,277
Go get 'em boys!

216
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:35,512
I didn't know they had security.

217
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:45,276
Aw, they are panicking.
I've to win this thing myself!

218
00:19:45,433 --> 00:19:48,107
Get off me! Help Curtiss!

219
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,693
Make ways, the American!

220
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,924
Hmm..alright I give up.

221
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,759
Guess I'll have to take this
baby to Milan for repairs.

222
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:24,599
With the help of American Donald Curtiss,airpirates shotdown Queen of the Mediterrean 2 security planes

223
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:30,613
after stealing all the valuables from the
ship,the pirates left the following message..

224
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,652
we're coming for ya!

225
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:35,447
Porco Rosso!

226
00:20:36,484 --> 00:20:37,451
Repeat...

227
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:40,455
we're coming for you Porco Rosso!
Alright Ark! Get off me!

228
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:44,998
You really expect me to wait here?

229
00:20:51,098 --> 00:20:52,872
Forget it! I'm off to Milan

230
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:59,931
Lucious feet, soft bed,
beautiful women.

231
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:05,330
There we go

232
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:09,314
Cmon baby. Just tour onto Milan

233
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:38,423
I don't like this weather.
I better duck below the clouds.

234
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:35,771
Cmon, girl, cmon on!

235
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:42,493
That's it. That's right!
Just stay with me baby!

236
00:22:54,205 --> 00:22:55,923
Porco!
What?

237
00:23:04,215 --> 00:23:06,309
Fight me pig! One on one!

238
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:08,310
No thanks Tex!
Kinda busy.

239
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:19,990
If you run away, I'll tell
everyone you are chicken!

240
00:23:20,231 --> 00:23:22,484
Chicken,pig... what's the difference?

241
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:27,114
Wo! I'm out in the open.

242
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:30,959
Oh! Cmon baby!

243
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:32,994
I hit the pig!

244
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:36,002
You didn't hit anything.
My engine died you idiot.

245
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:51,855
He's down! I'm a bonafide celebrity.
Yahoo!

246
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:13,915
I need some evidence or no one
will believe me. Let's see..

247
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:21,751
Gotcha!

248
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:42,029
Obnoxious red paint!
That's proof.

249
00:24:43,606 --> 00:24:46,405
I might just take it back to
Texas as a gift for mom.

250
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:33,884
Hurry, its an emergency!
Marco's been shot down!

251
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:40,855
Wait Ms.Gina!
There's a phone call for you.

252
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:44,088
Porco's alive. He's on the
phone right now.

253
00:25:46,295 --> 00:25:48,047
You can take it at the front desk.

254
00:25:48,166 --> 00:25:50,047
Hey! Wait!

255
00:25:56,430 --> 00:26:00,480
Marco? Are you all right? I was just
about go search for you in my boat.

256
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:04,238
I'm fine! A tugboat gave me a lift.
Aah!

257
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:08,278
Thank God! And I've slimmed down.
On an island for two days.

258
00:26:08,776 --> 00:26:13,998
So you look pretty good! Though
not sexy as that American flagway.

259
00:26:14,155 --> 00:26:16,580
I'm sure he'll be stopping by your place.
So tell him we'll meet again!

260
00:26:18,242 --> 00:26:20,297
Anyway, I'm in Milan to fix my plane.
You are in Italy?

261
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:24,011
You are an idiot! The Italians have
a warrant out for your arrest, remember?

262
00:26:24,213 --> 00:26:28,011
Don't care how great your mechanic is
over there. You get back home you hear me?

263
00:26:29,797 --> 00:26:35,119
Dont want to yell at you Marco. If you keep
acting so pigheaded,you gonna endup dead

264
00:26:35,319 --> 00:26:37,420
Cant go to another pilot's funeral. Come home

265
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:39,439
Sorry Baby! Gotta fly.

266
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:40,307
You jerk!

267
00:26:56,119 --> 00:26:59,119
Is Porco Rosso dead or alive?
Good question.

268
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:38,077
Hey Porco, I thought you would come
here tonight. So I waited up.

269
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,708
She really took a beating this time.

270
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:42,044
Looks like you are missing
half of the plane.

271
00:27:42,618 --> 00:27:45,247
Wouldn't it be easier
to build a new one?

272
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:46,915
I'm attached to this one.

273
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:49,042
Ah!Alright. It's your money

274
00:27:50,294 --> 00:27:52,387
Hey! Lookout, I'm gonna back her in.
Ok?

275
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:58,684
So tell me Piccolo, where did
you find the girl?

276
00:27:58,801 --> 00:28:01,020
That's my granddaughter, from America.

277
00:28:03,557 --> 00:28:06,105
Keep coming, keep coming.

278
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:30,134
Gorgeous fuselage, isn't Grandpa?
Great lines.

279
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:34,096
Not many workers around who can
do a job like that these days.

280
00:28:34,296 --> 00:28:35,593
Well theres no resemblence.

281
00:28:36,714 --> 00:28:38,808
Are you sure that girl
is your granddaughter, Piccolo?

282
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:40,385
Keep away from here.

283
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:45,724
Fio, you alright getting the
plane off the rig?

284
00:28:45,848 --> 00:28:47,442
Sure. No problem.

285
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:52,022
I gotta outfly an American named Curtiss
and my business is in the toilet.

286
00:28:52,189 --> 00:28:55,113
Curtiss? I got just the engine.

287
00:29:00,404 --> 00:29:01,326
What do you think?

288
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:03,333
This would give me some extra kick.

289
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:04,791
Don't ask how I got it.

290
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:11,299
All I can say is that it came from an Italian sea
plane that lost the Schneider Cup to Curtiss in 1927.

291
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:15,297
But it wasn't the engine's fault.
The mechanic was an idiot.

292
00:29:16,922 --> 00:29:18,298
I'll tune this up, just right.

293
00:29:18,589 --> 00:29:22,766
But don't tune it up too delicately.I'm not
flying this thing in a race, you know.

294
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:27,479
You are talking to the God of
engine-work here. Trust me!

295
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,654
You plan on taking
all of my money?

296
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:38,994
Quit wining! These days money's barely
worth the paper it's printed on.

297
00:29:39,193 --> 00:29:42,698
You coming up short! Give me the
money you got in your pocket.

298
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:46,367
I need that. I gotta pay for meals!
Hotel rooms, more meals.

299
00:29:46,617 --> 00:29:49,997
You can stay here. Meals included,
I won't charge you much.

300
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:55,300
So Piccolo, haven't seen your sons
around. Are they alright?

301
00:29:55,501 --> 00:29:57,220
They took off to find work.

302
00:29:57,503 --> 00:29:59,471
They took off? Then whose
gonna design my plane?

303
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:00,890
Fio will do it.

304
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:03,894
Fio? That cute little girl?

305
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:08,561
Can't be such a pig.She's a talented
engineer. Even better than my sons.

306
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:18,026
No dice pack. I need a professional. I'm
taking my worth money somewhere else. Sorry

307
00:30:19,817 --> 00:30:20,865
Wait!

308
00:30:26,907 --> 00:30:30,377
Are you leaving because I'm a woman?
Or is it because I'm too young?

309
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,413
Actually its both kiddo.

310
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:34,708
Ok that's fair.

311
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:39,430
But tell me, what's you think
takes a pilot to be great?

312
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:41,888
Experience?

313
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:44,134
No. It's intuition.

314
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:47,011
Hmm I just knew you weren't
gonna say experience.

315
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:52,151
Grandpa said you flew solo in the first
week and you were a great pilot.

316
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:53,253
Right from the very start.
Isn't that true?

317
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:59,115
Hmm yeah that was
1910 when I was 17.

318
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:02,615
17! That's the same age I am!

319
00:31:03,612 --> 00:31:08,163
I can't help being a woman,
but I gurantee you I have talent.

320
00:31:08,532 --> 00:31:12,163
If I don't do a good job, you
don't have to pay. Okay, Grandpa?

321
00:31:12,621 --> 00:31:14,839
She's my grand daughter,
she'll do fine.

322
00:31:15,414 --> 00:31:18,669
Now with me, I was fixing
engines at the age of 12.

323
00:31:19,126 --> 00:31:20,173
Why don't you sleep on it.

324
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:25,267
I'm off to bed. Breakfast is at 7.
Left you a clean towel in the bathroom.

325
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:26,166
Good night!

326
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:30,116
Still don't have enough.

327
00:31:30,376 --> 00:31:34,317
But since you're a good friend,
I've decided to loan you the rest.

328
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:20,529
Good morning. Did you sleep well?

329
00:32:20,689 --> 00:32:22,191
You up all night?

330
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:24,034
Here's a rough draft of the design.

331
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:28,417
So what do you think?

332
00:32:28,638 --> 00:32:31,488
I tweaked the wing section that should make
the plane fly atleast five knots faster.

333
00:32:31,567 --> 00:32:33,013
Look I dug up the original blueprints.

334
00:32:33,715 --> 00:32:35,778
The design is really radical.Huh?

335
00:32:37,095 --> 00:32:39,118
Wood monocco wings...

336
00:32:39,295 --> 00:32:41,172
with extreme angles of incidence!

337
00:32:41,247 --> 00:32:43,278
I've never seen anything like it.

338
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:46,438
Yeah they only made one. Then they
decided was too dangerous...

339
00:32:46,555 --> 00:32:49,355
No pilot could fly. I found it
covered and dusted in a warehouse


340
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:59,527
With the wings like that I'm really surprised
that you can get it off the water.

341
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:05,890
Takeoffs and landings can be a little bit tricky.
But get it up to speed, she handles like a dream.

342
00:33:06,108 --> 00:33:10,410
Why don't you try and increase the angle
of incidence by half a degree on the wing.

343
00:33:10,654 --> 00:33:12,577
The rest looks fine.

344
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:16,461
So you're giving me the job?
Thank you! For trusting a woman!

345
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:20,964
Alright you got the job
but on one condition,Fiona...

346
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:26,009
No more staying up all night or
your work will start getting sloppy.

347
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:28,469
Also its truly bad for your complexion.

348
00:33:29,798 --> 00:33:30,766
You got it.

349
00:33:31,792 --> 00:33:34,000
To be honest, I couldn't sleep
last night because...

350
00:33:34,237 --> 00:33:38,272
I was afraid you wouldn't give me the
job. I should sleep fine tonight

351
00:33:38,434 --> 00:33:42,278
I'll go make some coffee and I'll get
back to work.This is so exciting!

352
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,479
I can't wait to start building!

353
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:50,368
Don't tell me she plans on building
the whole plane by herself!

354
00:33:57,294 --> 00:34:00,151
This is my niece Monica.
Nice to meet you.

355
00:34:00,351 --> 00:34:03,451
This is Ivana, my other niece

356
00:34:03,621 --> 00:34:06,851
her four daughters, Sophia,
Laura, Constance and Valentina.

357
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:13,036
Fio's big sister Giliola. Sandra she's
my cousin. Marietta, good to see you.

358
00:34:13,201 --> 00:34:18,148
My sons' wives Maria, Tina, Anna,
and the trio...showtime!

359
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:19,936
Porkalino!

360
00:34:22,643 --> 00:34:24,817
Are you girls really still alive?

361
00:34:26,146 --> 00:34:29,351
You pig! We thought we
get in on the action.

362
00:34:32,253 --> 00:34:34,996
You are not here to
build my plane, are you?

363
00:34:35,222 --> 00:34:39,000
Yeah, we need to get
some poker money.

364
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:45,795
So this is the crew, huh?

365
00:34:48,418 --> 00:34:50,536
Don't you have any man relatives?

366
00:34:50,753 --> 00:34:54,976
All the men are gone. They had
to look elsewhere for work.

367
00:34:56,527 --> 00:34:58,829
This is work! Get them back...

368
00:34:59,014 --> 00:35:02,690
You mean a grate?
Don't be such a pig.

369
00:35:02,818 --> 00:35:04,393
You'll see, they're
very hard workers.

370
00:35:04,592 --> 00:35:06,693
Yeah we're not baking a cake here!

371
00:35:15,255 --> 00:35:19,262
Heavenly father, we give you thanks
for putting bread on our table...

372
00:35:19,463 --> 00:35:22,663
and for giving us work when we
were at the brink of bankruptcy

373
00:35:22,869 --> 00:35:26,717
Please forgive us for building a
fighter plane with the help of women.

374
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,117
Amen

375
00:35:29,753 --> 00:35:33,974
Please eat and work
on making that cake.

376
00:35:44,141 --> 00:35:47,362
Hear that? You gonna whip
pants off curtiss with this.

377
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:56,530
How do you think? Too delicate?

378
00:35:56,655 --> 00:36:00,079
I think this might be
bad for your shed, Piccolo.

379
00:36:00,824 --> 00:36:04,204
Yeah? Wait till we turn
it up to full speed.

380
00:36:35,275 --> 00:36:37,449
Hmm, so you want to add a trim tab?

381
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:39,371
Yeah. Can I?

382
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:44,081
Hmm I dunno, this is going
to cost a lot of money.

383
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:50,217
It's a great idea but we already gone way
over budget. See what the client think.

384
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,507
Porco...

385
00:36:55,963 --> 00:36:59,809
Would you stop looking at me like
that, Fio. Just do what's best.

386
00:37:00,135 --> 00:37:03,135
That's great! I've already
talked to the manufacturers.

387
00:37:03,235 --> 00:37:04,335
I'll can get the orders
filled right away!

388
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:06,103
I love you, Porco!

389
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:12,443
I give you three months
to pay the bill.

390
00:37:12,646 --> 00:37:14,900
Maybe I should just
become an air pirate.

391
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:16,574
You like Fio, huh?

392
00:37:18,126 --> 00:37:20,302
Don't touch her.

393
00:37:20,429 --> 00:37:22,282
Don't worry. Just looking
at her makes me tired.

394
00:38:36,289 --> 00:38:38,862
Ferrarin, look at you.
You are a major now.

395
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:42,780
Marco you crazy! What
you doing back in Italy?

396
00:38:42,902 --> 00:38:43,996
I make a loot come
and go, as I please.

397
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:49,114
The secret police already know you
are in the country. Were you followed?

398
00:38:49,215 --> 00:38:50,327
Yeah.
I gave em the slip

399
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:55,353
You gotta get outta Italy now. I've seen your
arrest warrant deserting the Italian Air force,

400
00:38:55,717 --> 00:39:00,092
entering the country illegally,
being a blatantly unpatriotic pig

401
00:39:01,797 --> 00:39:03,641
This is no time to laugh, Marco!

402
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:07,478
They got it in for you, they want
to confiscate your plane.

403
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:10,389
Man, this movie stinks.

404
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:14,108
Marco why don't you come back
to the Air Force? I got influence now

405
00:39:14,208 --> 00:39:16,108
I can work something out.

406
00:39:16,938 --> 00:39:19,565
Thanks for the offer. But I
rather be a pig than a Fascist.

407
00:39:19,773 --> 00:39:21,942
Then you better keep
your plane off the skies.

408
00:39:22,277 --> 00:39:26,123
The only way the Italians will let
you fly is if you fly for our country.

409
00:39:27,657 --> 00:39:30,079
I only fly for myself.

410
00:39:30,219 --> 00:39:32,713
You really are a pig, aren't you?

411
00:39:32,956 --> 00:39:36,210
You realise if they can a pig,
they won't give you a fair trial.

412
00:39:36,389 --> 00:39:39,809
I understand.Thanks Ferrarin.
Give my regards to the guys.

413
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,304
This movie is really great.

414
00:39:41,963 --> 00:39:45,432
Alright I'll try to lookout for you.
But I can only do so much.

415
00:39:45,635 --> 00:39:48,887
Sure. Well so long friend.

416
00:40:07,463 --> 00:40:09,036
Hey Porco, need a ride?

417
00:40:13,028 --> 00:40:15,001
Slide over.

418
00:40:22,085 --> 00:40:25,342
I borrowed this truck so we can
take the seaplane to the lake..

419
00:40:25,543 --> 00:40:27,342
We're ready to give
it a test flight.

420
00:40:27,507 --> 00:40:30,056
No test flights. I'm gettin'
out of here today.

421
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:34,686
That's ridiculous! I refuse to give
you the plane without testing it.

422
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:38,563
Plus it will take atleast a day to take the
plane apart and transport it to the lake.

423
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:43,226
I don't have a choice. I want you to
take a good look behind this van.

424
00:40:43,326 --> 00:40:45,000
Do it slowly.

425
00:40:45,099 --> 00:40:46,911
Thats the Fascist Secret Police.

426
00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:49,914
They're following us.

427
00:40:50,782 --> 00:40:52,876
Following us? What for?

428
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:58,715
Because they like my pretty red plane.
Problem is they don't like me flying it.

429
00:41:01,918 --> 00:41:04,545
Hey, are you a spy or something?

430
00:41:09,092 --> 00:41:10,719
A spy?

431
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:16,273
That's the last thing I ever do
kid. I don't look after myself.

432
00:41:16,641 --> 00:41:19,190
But you were a hero
during the war, right?

433
00:41:19,893 --> 00:41:22,112
Well this is really strange if
you haven't done anything wrong!

434
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:24,565
Couldn't agree with you more.

435
00:41:24,666 --> 00:41:26,565
Hold on!

436
00:41:28,945 --> 00:41:30,697
How about we try
another direction?

437
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:45,971
Looks like you done this
kind of thing before.

438
00:41:46,211 --> 00:41:48,260
Everytime I go to Milan kiddo.

439
00:42:17,684 --> 00:42:19,000
The plane's ready than you were.

440
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:22,836
Two secret police are hiding out
back and three in the front.

441
00:42:22,956 --> 00:42:24,934
This is so exciting!

442
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:27,757
Calm down woman, you rambling.
What?

443
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:31,516
Thanks
Take care.

444
00:42:31,657 --> 00:42:32,317
I will

445
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:45,692
Fio, what do you think you doing?

446
00:42:46,438 --> 00:42:49,157
I'm rigging up my seat. Just
give me about five seconds. Ok?

447
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:53,989
You are crazy if you think I'm
letting you fly along with me.

448
00:42:54,489 --> 00:42:56,958
Shh! The secret police will hear you.

449
00:42:57,282 --> 00:42:59,001
Fio!

450
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:05,125
There's a warrant out for my arrest, you realize?
This is not a joyride sweetheart,so if you...

451
00:43:05,248 --> 00:43:06,670
Hold this a second please.

452
00:43:08,126 --> 00:43:11,130
Thank you. Look at this. Tada!

453
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:14,130
I just wipped this together.
And it fits perfectly...

454
00:43:14,226 --> 00:43:16,677
It's a bit of a tight
fit but it should do.

455
00:43:17,969 --> 00:43:19,222
Would you hold this please?

456
00:43:20,081 --> 00:43:24,530
Fio this is way too dangerous! I'll
be taking it from the canal out back

457
00:43:24,730 --> 00:43:27,730
I don't even know if I can
get her off the water!

458
00:43:29,025 --> 00:43:33,036
Eh,hmm. I know! That's why you need
to have the engineer with you.

459
00:43:33,237 --> 00:43:34,349
So that I can make
adjustments to the plane

460
00:43:34,528 --> 00:43:37,036
Don't you get it?
I'm off to fight Curtiss.

461
00:43:37,235 --> 00:43:39,750
I'll have bullets flying over my head!

462
00:43:40,083 --> 00:43:45,710
I can handle that. I'm responsible for this
plane and I wanna do my first job right!

463
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:52,112
Think about it. I'm a known womanizer, I
live on a deserted island in a small tent.

464
00:43:52,246 --> 00:43:53,764
That's great. I love camping.

465
00:43:53,974 --> 00:43:55,137
That's not the point.

466
00:43:56,300 --> 00:44:00,726
Take her. I'll give you a good deal on the
salary. And I know she will come handy.

467
00:44:01,179 --> 00:44:03,898
Besides I want you back in
business, so that I can get paid.

468
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:05,733
You are this girl's grandfather?

469
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:10,239
It'll be good for her. And I'll
install this so you two can chit chat.

470
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:13,451
So you are okay with turning
her into an outlaw?

471
00:44:13,693 --> 00:44:16,572
Ehmm..Hmm I'm going along as your hostage.

472
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:21,547
See that way all my relatives can tell the
police that they had no choice but to help you!

473
00:44:22,952 --> 00:44:27,081
So please Porco, let me come.
I can help you.

474
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:32,327
You better take out one of the machine guns.
What?

475
00:44:33,086 --> 00:44:37,757
Theres not enough space even with
your tiny butt. Now take out a gun.

476
00:44:37,884 --> 00:44:41,934
Thank you! And you know my butt is bigger than
it looks. I'll have to get out in 2 secs.

477
00:44:43,722 --> 00:44:47,603
If we hang around here much longer,
you and the old ladies might come.

478
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:49,896
And that will cost
you a lotta mullah!

479
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:54,074
Grandma get out of the way!

480
00:44:54,275 --> 00:44:56,447
Hey Fio, you bring back souvenirs.

481
00:44:56,648 --> 00:44:57,248
I will.

482
00:45:05,577 --> 00:45:07,420
Contact!

483
00:45:16,554 --> 00:45:18,260
Open the door!

484
00:45:26,306 --> 00:45:27,307
Go!

485
00:45:36,208 --> 00:45:37,108
Get down!

486
00:45:47,786 --> 00:45:51,336
Kidnapper! Give back our girl Fio!

487
00:45:51,536 --> 00:45:53,137
Bring Fio back!

488
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:01,634
How's the steering, Porco?

489
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:05,641
It's crazy, just like you, Fio.
Its even harder than handle before!

490
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:11,360
Stop the plane.I'll
make some adjustments.

491
00:46:11,518 --> 00:46:14,362
No we don't have time. I'll get
her up in the air somehow.

492
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:19,867
I can't get enough lift!

493
00:46:20,987 --> 00:46:21,987
Porco there's a ship!

494
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:27,041
Get her up!

495
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:32,081
Come on, baby!

496
00:46:32,664 --> 00:46:35,088
The eorons hitting the water.
Use the trim tabs.

497
00:46:35,208 --> 00:46:35,880
The what?

498
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:37,414
It's the crate on your right.

499
00:46:38,628 --> 00:46:39,596
Hurry!

500
00:46:52,684 --> 00:46:55,233
Got it. Here we go.

501
00:47:30,764 --> 00:47:33,768
Gorgeous! This is such
an incredible view!

502
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:39,277
Is that plane following us?

503
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:41,657
Its someone from the Italian Air force.

504
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,784
Hey! Looks like my old buddy
Ferrarin is here.

505
00:47:53,199 --> 00:47:55,081
What's he saying?

506
00:47:55,246 --> 00:47:59,467
He says the Air force has a trap for us up
ahead. Knows show how we can get outta here!

507
00:48:18,603 --> 00:48:21,527
If we fly low all the way home,
we should stay outta their range.

508
00:48:21,981 --> 00:48:23,449
Thank you very much, my friend!

509
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:25,820
Thank you!

510
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:30,420
Very funny!

511
00:48:31,719 --> 00:48:32,420
What did he say?

512
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:37,164
He said "Cute girl, when did you
start babysitting"?

513
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:45,490
Alas! A solitary rose
blooms in the secret garden.

514
00:49:46,599 --> 00:49:49,903
That's my favorite line
from a screenplay I wrote.

515
00:49:53,865 --> 00:49:56,994
Mr.Curtiss, why are you
trespassing in my garden.

516
00:49:57,452 --> 00:49:59,501
I've something special to show you.

517
00:50:06,128 --> 00:50:07,755
It's from Hollywood.

518
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:11,764
“Dear Mr.Curtiss, In regards to the screenplay
you sent us...”

519
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:15,603
"We would love to produce it and we
would consider you for the lead"

520
00:50:16,262 --> 00:50:19,233
The script's title is the
Rose of the Adriatic.

521
00:50:19,391 --> 00:50:20,266
That sounds wonderful.

522
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:22,436
Really? Then it's settled.

523
00:50:22,894 --> 00:50:25,273
Gina, come to Hollywood with me.

524
00:50:27,565 --> 00:50:31,615
I've got great aspirations. I'm
already a big celebrity as a pilot!

525
00:50:32,403 --> 00:50:34,623
Soon I'll be a Hollywood star.

526
00:50:34,757 --> 00:50:35,954
And then...
There's more?

527
00:50:36,909 --> 00:50:38,126
The President!

528
00:50:45,833 --> 00:50:50,715
What's so funny? I'm serious!
Don't you wanna be the First Lady?

529
00:50:51,150 --> 00:50:52,172
Gina!

530
00:50:53,634 --> 00:50:56,307
I find your humility very charming.

531
00:50:56,469 --> 00:50:57,471
So you come with me?

532
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:02,358
No I can't. I've a long
standing bet coming here!

533
00:51:05,436 --> 00:51:08,315
I bet myself that if a certain
man comes to visit me when...

534
00:51:08,474 --> 00:51:11,614
I'm out here in my garden,that
the two of us will fall in love.

535
00:51:12,777 --> 00:51:15,998
But that fool only comes
to my restaurant at night.

536
00:51:16,614 --> 00:51:19,164
He never stops and shows
his face in the daylight.

537
00:52:01,827 --> 00:52:03,875
Porco? I thought he was dead!

538
00:53:04,222 --> 00:53:05,269
You fool.

539
00:53:15,108 --> 00:53:18,659
He left without landing.
My luck I lose again.

540
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:21,791
What? You chose that
stupid pig over me?

541
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:23,413
That's right.

542
00:53:24,284 --> 00:53:27,958
Love is a little bit more complicated
here than it is in America.

543
00:53:28,414 --> 00:53:30,291
Falling in love, happens to
you all the time

544
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:34,469
So have fun in Hollywood, little boy.

545
00:53:34,753 --> 00:53:36,175
Little boy?

546
00:53:40,467 --> 00:53:43,721
Hey! Watch it with the acrobatics.
You made me bump my head.

547
00:53:44,137 --> 00:53:46,139
I'm just saying hi to a friend.

548
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:48,188
Gina of the Hotel Adriano?

549
00:53:49,934 --> 00:53:54,181
She was the Lady in the white dress,
wasn't she? My grandfather told me...

550
00:53:54,239 --> 00:53:57,989
that all seaplane pilots of the
Adriatic fall madly in love with Gina.

551
00:53:58,235 --> 00:53:59,782
That's wonderful Fio.

552
00:54:01,405 --> 00:54:04,784
So is Gina really your friend?
Or are you in love with her too?

553
00:54:05,199 --> 00:54:08,295
It's time to refuel! Turn around, quit
yapping and get your butt in your seat.

554
00:54:08,411 --> 00:54:10,005
What! Hey wait!

555
00:54:35,063 --> 00:54:37,737
Hey! What's a girl doing
up Porco's plane?

556
00:54:39,025 --> 00:54:40,152
Where's Porco?

557
00:54:40,652 --> 00:54:42,746
He's having a serious
conversation with my dad.

558
00:54:46,146 --> 00:54:47,246
Both the new government
and the old royalist...

559
00:54:47,492 --> 00:54:51,168
have started striking deals
with seaplane pirates.

560
00:54:51,329 --> 00:54:55,005
You are not gonna make a penny
hunting pirates these days, Porco.

561
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:56,090
There you go.

562
00:54:56,155 --> 00:54:57,047
Thanks.

563
00:54:57,668 --> 00:54:59,887
Well sounds like you are
out of a job Porco!

564
00:55:00,099 --> 00:55:03,768
You should join up with
one of the two factions.

565
00:55:04,175 --> 00:55:06,894
They pay good money for skills like yours.

566
00:55:07,012 --> 00:55:08,228
You betcha.

567
00:55:08,387 --> 00:55:11,561
Specially after Curtiss
goes back to America.

568
00:55:11,682 --> 00:55:15,233
America? You're the ones who
should be going to America.

569
00:55:16,521 --> 00:55:20,072
Farewell to the freedome in Adriatic
and to days in god abandon.

570
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:21,822
What is that? Shakespeare?

571
00:55:21,943 --> 00:55:23,911
No, it's Porco. See you later.

572
00:55:24,134 --> 00:55:25,380
So long.

573
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:33,918
The price of gas here is ridiculous. He's
charging us 3 times what we pay in Italy.

574
00:55:36,041 --> 00:55:37,918
Don't be such a crook.
Be reasonable.

575
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:42,385
Here in the Adriatic Islands, we don't
dilute our gas like Italians do.

576
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:44,592
Can you please explain
that to her, Porco?

577
00:55:45,217 --> 00:55:46,719
Just pay the kid, Fio.

578
00:55:47,219 --> 00:55:51,440
Then plant your butt that looks bigger
than it looks back in the cubby hall.

579
00:55:51,543 --> 00:55:53,471
We're taking off with my hat out.

580
00:55:53,625 --> 00:55:56,603
Fine! The gas money is going
on your bill anyway!

581
00:56:01,309 --> 00:56:05,000
So when do we fight Curtiss?
No need to now.

582
00:56:05,130 --> 00:56:07,179
I'm outta a job, no ones hiring
bounty hunters these days!

583
00:56:07,271 --> 00:56:13,518
What about your honor? You can't let Curtiss
run around acting like he shot you down .

584
00:56:13,614 --> 00:56:16,887
I'm a pig! I don't fight for honor.
I fight for a paycheck.

585
00:56:36,601 --> 00:56:37,818
It's beautiful!

586
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:56,253
What a fantastic hideout.

587
00:56:57,789 --> 00:57:01,168
Agh! It's good to stretch my legs.

588
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:20,858
Ah! Looks like my hideout
isn't so hidden anyway.

589
00:57:20,978 --> 00:57:23,072
Boss! We got the pig!

590
00:57:23,731 --> 00:57:25,826
Get off me!

591
00:57:26,010 --> 00:57:27,619
Out of the way!

592
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:30,114
You're finished, pig.

593
00:57:30,237 --> 00:57:31,864
It's payback time.

594
00:57:31,989 --> 00:57:34,038
We've got scores to settle.

595
00:57:35,284 --> 00:57:38,137
A girl!
We got a girl here!

596
00:57:38,222 --> 00:57:39,139
She's cute.

597
00:57:39,331 --> 00:57:43,581
So what? Half the world
population is women. Idiot!

598
00:57:44,793 --> 00:57:49,144
Hey Fio is no ordinary girl! She's
a first class seaplane engineer.

599
00:57:49,289 --> 00:57:53,000
But she's so young.
And pretty!

600
00:57:53,204 --> 00:57:55,130
A girl engineer?
Are you sure?

601
00:57:55,246 --> 00:57:58,168
She redesigned my plane and
now it flies better than ever.

602
00:57:58,268 --> 00:58:01,188
She's young, but she's a genius!

603
00:58:01,288 --> 00:58:03,166
Wooh?
You really mean that?

604
00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:06,574
Hey! I never lie about my seaplane, kid.

605
00:58:06,731 --> 00:58:10,478
Treat her with respect. She came
along just to make sure I pay my bill.

606
00:58:11,894 --> 00:58:14,074
So you're in debt, too?
It serves you right!

607
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:21,172
Hey what do you say, we smash his stupid red plane
to bits. And leave him here to rot and dead?

608
00:58:21,297 --> 00:58:24,085
Smash it? You destroy a work of art?

609
00:58:24,876 --> 00:58:27,579
It happens to be a one
of a kind Savoy-S21

610
00:58:28,612 --> 00:58:31,092
We realize it's a nice plane...

611
00:58:31,170 --> 00:58:32,108
but we have our reaons.

612
00:58:32,425 --> 00:58:34,099
Yeah? What are they?

613
00:58:34,186 --> 00:58:36,889
Well it's kinda complicated.
And you call yourselves seaplane pilots?

614
00:58:37,097 --> 00:58:39,269
Step aside. Watch the shoes!

615
00:58:47,858 --> 00:58:53,000
My grandpa has been telling me stories
of seaplane pirates ever since I was born.

616
00:58:53,199 --> 00:58:59,092
He says seaplane pirates are the most honorable
and trustworthy fighters in the world!.

617
00:58:59,184 --> 00:59:04,215
Everytime they fly both the ocean
and the sky purify their hearts.

618
00:59:04,365 --> 00:59:07,105
So they're braver than
any pilot in the sky...

619
00:59:07,224 --> 00:59:09,329
and they are mightier than
any sailor in the sea!.

620
00:59:11,255 --> 00:59:14,851
Ms.Fio! Thank you, you make me
proud to be a seaplane pirate.

621
00:59:14,996 --> 00:59:20,746
And you should be, I can tell it's not
about money or revenge. You are about honor!

622
00:59:22,844 --> 00:59:23,614
Yeah! That's right, Fio! Yeah
To honor!

623
00:59:26,818 --> 00:59:30,485
Now that girl is something else.

624
00:59:30,608 --> 00:59:37,009
Ok Ms.Fio, we respect you so we'll
not destroy the plane that you made!

625
00:59:37,099 --> 00:59:40,001
But we still hate that stinkin'
pig's gut and we want payback.

626
00:59:40,090 --> 00:59:44,827
Slice that pig to bacon!
Yeah!

627
00:59:44,952 --> 00:59:46,831
What are you morons talking about?

628
00:59:46,791 --> 00:59:50,637
You can't gangup on a fellow sea
plane pilot! Where is your honor?

629
00:59:51,003 --> 00:59:53,677
You ought to be completely
ashamed of yourselves!

630
00:59:54,132 --> 00:59:57,978
A real seaplane pirate would never
fight in a pack like bunch of cowards!

631
00:59:58,344 --> 01:00:02,521
Look at Porco, he just came back so that
we could have a re-match with Curtiss.

632
01:00:02,807 --> 01:00:06,358
And defend his reputation
like a real sea pirate should.

633
01:00:06,644 --> 01:00:10,490
So if you wanna fight Porco honorably
then you fight him in the sky!

634
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:13,298
One on one.
I would fight Porco...

635
01:00:13,369 --> 01:00:15,199
but my plane has engine trouble.

636
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:18,199
You big liar! Quit makin' excuses.

637
01:00:18,447 --> 01:00:19,824
What should we do, Boss?

638
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:21,702
She did make some good points.
Yeah!

639
01:00:21,909 --> 01:00:26,541
We should pick someone who can fight
Porco. I think we should talk to Curtiss.

640
01:00:26,664 --> 01:00:29,384
Wait a minute! Asking him
to fight the pig again?

641
01:00:29,668 --> 01:00:31,715
Only Curtiss can beat him.

642
01:00:32,336 --> 01:00:34,010
The contract with him
has already expired!

643
01:00:37,217 --> 01:00:39,936
Howdy fellas!
What? It's Curtiss!

644
01:00:40,135 --> 01:00:42,436
What's he doin' here?

645
01:00:43,139 --> 01:00:46,894
I followed ya' all! I knew you
get into trouble without me!

646
01:00:48,853 --> 01:00:52,358
Nice goin' Fio. Look at the
mess you got me into now.

647
01:01:03,577 --> 01:01:05,079
Here..hold these.

648
01:01:09,708 --> 01:01:12,130
So do you want me to challenge
for a rematch do you, pig?

649
01:01:12,501 --> 01:01:18,134
Why should I give it to ya? I won once already
and my contract with these boys is expired.

650
01:01:18,550 --> 01:01:20,927
Well give us a proposition?
What do you want?

651
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:33,280
Beautiful!

652
01:01:34,398 --> 01:01:36,947
Tell you what, if I win
will you marry me darlin'?

653
01:01:40,362 --> 01:01:41,614
That's what I want.

654
01:01:41,780 --> 01:01:46,628
Fine with me! But if Porco beats you, then
you ought to pay the debt he owes me.

655
01:01:47,077 --> 01:01:48,079
Don't do it, Fio!

656
01:01:48,621 --> 01:01:50,090
Eh, backup!.

657
01:01:54,418 --> 01:01:56,967
Ms.Fio are you quite
ceratin you wanna do this?

658
01:01:57,130 --> 01:01:58,802
You should ask him not me.

659
01:01:58,923 --> 01:02:00,766
These bills are kinda expensive.

660
01:02:00,884 --> 01:02:01,976
No they're not!

661
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:03,762
Are you gonna fight or not?

662
01:02:04,679 --> 01:02:07,306
I'll gladly fight for
the woman that I love!

663
01:02:07,431 --> 01:02:08,648
Good!

664
01:02:09,476 --> 01:02:13,777
Alright! The fight will take place
first thing tomorrow morning!.

665
01:02:13,938 --> 01:02:17,489
Since Fio is doing such an
honorable thing, my gang will host!

666
01:02:18,610 --> 01:02:20,829
Hey we like to host too!
Yeah! Yeah!

667
01:02:25,449 --> 01:02:28,168
See you later, Ms.Fio!

668
01:02:30,789 --> 01:02:31,835
This is ridiculous!

669
01:02:32,123 --> 01:02:34,842
Don't forget to show up, pig!

670
01:02:35,168 --> 01:02:38,842
Shut up, just go home already!

671
01:02:39,422 --> 01:02:40,344
Ok!

672
01:02:44,427 --> 01:02:48,978
What on Earth possessed you,
to make that deal?

673
01:02:49,431 --> 01:02:53,858
Well I'm sorry, I guess I
shouldn't have been ameaned.

674
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,099
I'm just a stupid little girl!

675
01:03:00,025 --> 01:03:01,027
Fio?

676
01:03:01,652 --> 01:03:04,702
I should thank you for
saving my life back there!

677
01:03:05,614 --> 01:03:07,208
You really put yourself on the line.

678
01:03:07,826 --> 01:03:11,706
So thanks. It looks like we are
into this thing together now.

679
01:03:12,204 --> 01:03:13,831
So you'll fight Curtiss?

680
01:03:15,833 --> 01:03:17,835
He could win you know.
Hmm

681
01:03:19,128 --> 01:03:20,802
You got more honor.

682
01:03:22,298 --> 01:03:27,726
Honor? I hate that word, but somehow
when you say it doesn't sound so bad..

683
01:03:33,393 --> 01:03:37,398
What's the matter with you?
Are you cold? Fio>

684
01:03:37,813 --> 01:03:39,065
Oh Boy!.

685
01:03:39,858 --> 01:03:43,362
I'm shaking allover. My heart's
pounding like crazy

686
01:03:43,695 --> 01:03:45,572
I guess I was really scared .

687
01:03:46,322 --> 01:03:48,871
I just didn't know you
would fight for me Porco!

688
01:03:52,369 --> 01:03:53,586
Woah! What you doin'?

689
01:03:54,204 --> 01:03:55,251
I need a swim.

690
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:16,773
Oh No!
What?

691
01:04:16,936 --> 01:04:18,152
What's wrong?

692
01:04:18,896 --> 01:04:22,117
I really lew it Porco.

693
01:04:22,775 --> 01:04:24,148
I should have padded those bills!

694
01:04:24,248 --> 01:04:25,449
Curtiss would have paid a lot more!

695
01:04:28,364 --> 01:04:29,581
You're right!

696
01:05:23,753 --> 01:05:24,878
Porco?

697
01:05:25,295 --> 01:05:27,889
Can't you sleep?

698
01:05:29,342 --> 01:05:30,639
I saw...

699
01:05:32,302 --> 01:05:33,896
Maybe it was a dream.

700
01:05:35,056 --> 01:05:38,025
Go back to sleep.
We gotta big day tomorrow.

701
01:05:39,643 --> 01:05:40,644
Porco?

702
01:05:41,186 --> 01:05:43,530
Yeah?
Why did you turn into a pig?

703
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:45,362
Hmm.. All middle aged men are pigs!

704
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:52,416
You know I've heard a lot about Capt.Marco
Rossolini. My father was in his fighter unit.

705
01:05:52,990 --> 01:05:57,541
He told me that Marco once landed
a seaplane in raging sea...

706
01:05:57,661 --> 01:05:59,664
to save the life of an enemy pilot.
I think that's amazing!

707
01:06:04,710 --> 01:06:06,713
I got it! What if I kiss you Porco?

708
01:06:08,547 --> 01:06:13,724
Yeah you heard the fairy tale where the girl kisses
the frog and turns him back to a handsome prince?

709
01:06:14,052 --> 01:06:18,057
Cmon! You gotta save it for somebody
special. For crying out loud.

710
01:06:19,893 --> 01:06:21,735
Don't you like me?

711
01:06:24,355 --> 01:06:25,731
You're a great kid.

712
01:06:26,065 --> 01:06:31,036
You know what Fio? Seeing you makes me
wish I shouldn't have given up being human.

713
01:06:31,403 --> 01:06:33,405
Now go to sleep.

714
01:06:33,530 --> 01:06:36,125
First tell me a story,
then I'll goto sleep.

715
01:06:37,659 --> 01:06:38,911
Alright

716
01:06:41,206 --> 01:06:42,583
Here's a winner!

717
01:06:51,382 --> 01:06:54,010
It was the last summer
of the great war...

718
01:06:55,302 --> 01:07:01,561
We were flying over the Adriatic, on a
routine survellience patrol heading to Istria.

719
01:07:06,648 --> 01:07:09,617
My good buddy Berlini
was right beside me.

720
01:07:10,108 --> 01:07:14,579
He had just gotten married
to Gina from the Hotel Adriana.

721
01:07:15,532 --> 01:07:18,626
And I was his best man.

722
01:07:19,228 --> 01:07:23,418
But the war called so he had to go
back to battle right after the ceremony.

723
01:07:32,893 --> 01:07:36,318
Suddenly we were in the middle
of the worst dogfight in my life.

724
01:07:42,688 --> 01:07:46,317
Friends and enemies were falling
around me like flies.

725
01:07:46,525 --> 01:07:50,494
I had 3 planes trying
to chase me down.

726
01:07:50,635 --> 01:07:56,454
And all I thought about was myself. Soon I
realised I was the only one left from my unit.

727
01:07:56,739 --> 01:08:01,619
But the enemy never let up. I feel
my guts out trying to get away.

728
01:08:01,952 --> 01:08:07,375
My hands and feet went numb. I could
feel myself starting to blackout.

729
01:08:07,485 --> 01:08:11,846
I was sure I was gonna die then suddenly
everything around me turned white.

730
01:08:12,130 --> 01:08:13,130
White?

731
01:08:13,255 --> 01:08:16,055
Yeah, it was the strangest thing I ever seen.

732
01:08:17,243 --> 01:08:21,000
A light that was so pure,
I figured I must be in heaven.

733
01:08:21,118 --> 01:08:25,225
Then I realized that I had flown into
a cloud. I was so exhausted that...

734
01:08:25,324 --> 01:08:27,524
I couldn't hold the stick to fly my plane.

735
01:08:27,811 --> 01:08:31,065
But the plane just kept on flying.

736
01:08:57,257 --> 01:08:58,930
Flew by itself?

737
01:08:59,385 --> 01:09:05,063
Yeah it was perfectly quiet.
And the sky was beautiful...

738
01:09:05,557 --> 01:09:10,564
then I saw this strange
white band high above me.

739
01:09:38,131 --> 01:09:40,430
Berlini, I thought you were dead!

740
01:09:44,096 --> 01:09:46,440
Come back here! Where do
you think you are going?

741
01:09:59,444 --> 01:10:02,948
What about Gina?
You can't leave her alone.

742
01:10:03,082 --> 01:10:04,625
Let me go instead!
Hold on!

743
01:10:45,158 --> 01:10:50,163
When I came to, I was skimming
just above the sea, all alone.

744
01:10:53,541 --> 01:10:56,168
God was telling you,
it wasn't your time yet.

745
01:10:58,203 --> 01:11:03,010
You think? Seems to me, he was telling me maybe
I was a pig and I deserved to be all alone.

746
01:11:03,301 --> 01:11:05,850
You can't believe that!
You're a good person!

747
01:11:06,371 --> 01:11:11,523
No! The good ones are the ones who died.
Or maybe I'm dead, life as a pig.

748
01:11:12,100 --> 01:11:15,024
It's the same thing as hell.
Now go to sleep.

749
01:11:17,523 --> 01:11:20,117
That stupid kid, he sold
me rusted cartridges.

750
01:11:22,487 --> 01:11:27,538
I think you are a great human being,
Porco. I'm glad you're still around.

751
01:11:28,533 --> 01:11:29,581
Good night!

752
01:11:54,226 --> 01:11:57,070
Place your bets here!

753
01:11:58,689 --> 01:12:01,908
Box seats here!
Place your wager!

754
01:12:12,161 --> 01:12:14,913
Buncha morons!
They'll turn this into a big party

755
01:12:15,081 --> 01:12:17,082
Are all of these people air pirates?

756
01:12:17,250 --> 01:12:21,926
No they are trash all over the Mediterranean.
Gangsters, smugglers, gamblers...

757
01:12:22,212 --> 01:12:25,591
Yeah you might have a handful of
few respectful people but I doubt it.

758
01:12:26,725 --> 01:12:29,805
Wow! Not only will I get a wife but
also will be getting more famous!

759
01:12:30,387 --> 01:12:33,608
Ten minutes to start!
Ten minutes to start!

760
01:12:34,266 --> 01:12:39,614
Listen up! This is a final bouter
between Porco Rosso and Donald Curtiss.

761
01:12:40,146 --> 01:12:46,119
So if one of you fights dirty, you'll be
disrespected by seaplane pilots for eternity !

762
01:12:46,404 --> 01:12:50,125
Cmon! No speeches, no speeches!

763
01:12:53,578 --> 01:12:57,457
Quite down ! The next person
I hear whining is dead meat!

764
01:13:06,716 --> 01:13:09,014
Why not drop a bomb?
Really gets them quite.

765
01:13:09,426 --> 01:13:13,278
This fight will decides
the fate of Ms.Fio...

766
01:13:14,368 --> 01:13:15,020
who you all love and respect!
So keep your mouth shut.

767
01:13:16,559 --> 01:13:20,779
You got that? If you do
clap your hands, clap now!

768
01:13:22,814 --> 01:13:24,158
Let's get started already!

769
01:13:24,274 --> 01:13:27,619
Shut up pig! We're following
official procedures

770
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:31,324
Now both you place your
bets on these chairs!

771
01:13:37,287 --> 01:13:38,335
Thank you.

772
01:13:39,122 --> 01:13:40,500
Set it down, moron!

773
01:13:43,711 --> 01:13:48,136
If both sides are satisfied, you should
shake hands or something like that!

774
01:13:48,256 --> 01:13:51,055
Forget it. I like to keep my hands clean.

775
01:13:53,345 --> 01:13:56,145
Shh! Alright! Let's just
get on with it.

776
01:13:56,390 --> 01:13:59,143
We'll go to the church
as soon as this is over!

777
01:14:00,019 --> 01:14:04,319
Ah! Don't worry Fio. Accordin' to
ma sweet mama it isn't love that counts! .

778
01:14:09,694 --> 01:14:11,662
Fio, can we take a picture with you?

779
01:14:11,780 --> 01:14:12,828
We took a bath!

780
01:14:12,948 --> 01:14:14,826
Ok? Everybody ready?

781
01:14:15,283 --> 01:14:16,376
Cheese! Smile!

782
01:14:38,724 --> 01:14:41,568
Place your bets here!
Three mins to Curtiss in favor!

783
01:14:41,726 --> 01:14:45,072
This is great! We should get
them to do this every month!

784
01:14:48,317 --> 01:14:50,411
15 seconds to start.

785
01:14:54,698 --> 01:14:56,417
Wow! I got chills.

786
01:14:57,702 --> 01:14:58,748
Five seconds...

787
01:14:58,868 --> 01:14:59,744
Four...

788
01:14:59,869 --> 01:15:00,746
Three...

789
01:15:00,871 --> 01:15:01,747
Two...

790
01:15:01,872 --> 01:15:02,588
One...

791
01:15:02,707 --> 01:15:03,724
Go! Go! Go

792
01:15:12,091 --> 01:15:13,592
Curtiss is up first!

793
01:15:31,359 --> 01:15:33,453
It looks like its gonna
be a one sided fight!

794
01:15:33,612 --> 01:15:34,613
Gimme those!

795
01:15:41,369 --> 01:15:43,792
Porco! What you doing?
Get some altitude!

796
01:15:43,913 --> 01:15:46,167
He'll be eating bullets
if he climbs up now.

797
01:15:46,542 --> 01:15:48,270
He being tricky.

798
01:15:48,369 --> 01:15:51,270
It will be harder for Curtiss to
hit him if is closer to the water.

799
01:15:55,259 --> 01:15:57,978
Aha! You are trying to make
me waste my bullets, aren't you?

800
01:16:14,110 --> 01:16:16,659
Look at that! Porco gave him the loop.

801
01:16:16,780 --> 01:16:17,828
Whats the loop?

802
01:16:18,282 --> 01:16:21,161
The loop is what made Porco
the Ace of the Adriatic!

803
01:16:26,332 --> 01:16:27,332
He's got me!

804
01:16:33,506 --> 01:16:34,506
He's gonna shoot!

805
01:16:39,302 --> 01:16:42,146
Look he's not shooting! What's
wrong? Is his machinegun jammed?

806
01:16:42,472 --> 01:16:46,319
I think I know what's going on
here. Porco won't shoot a pilot!

807
01:16:47,103 --> 01:16:51,699
He'll always shoot the plane!
Look, there he's in perfect position!

808
01:16:51,856 --> 01:16:53,029
Cmon! Shoot!

809
01:16:53,525 --> 01:16:56,871
No! He's not going for it!
Just as I thought!

810
01:16:57,695 --> 01:17:00,198
If the pig shoots now,
he'll kill Curtiss.

811
01:17:00,323 --> 01:17:04,875
I bet he plans to tire Curtiss out
and shoot his engine up instead.

812
01:17:05,037 --> 01:17:07,000
What a show-off.

813
01:17:08,414 --> 01:17:09,587
Porco...

814
01:17:10,458 --> 01:17:13,554
Are you messin' with me?
Cmon shoot!

815
01:17:14,639 --> 01:17:18,889
Ah! I bet your gun is jammed!
Isn't? Serves you right pig!

816
01:17:24,556 --> 01:17:25,899
They are coming towards us!

817
01:17:28,853 --> 01:17:31,402
So you wanna play games with me?
Is that it?

818
01:17:36,402 --> 01:17:38,779
Don't kill us!
Kill each other!

819
01:17:38,988 --> 01:17:40,534
Curtiss pulled away from the pig!

820
01:17:41,234 --> 01:17:43,000
Jump! Jump!

821
01:17:53,543 --> 01:17:54,796
Hey! Watch the money!

822
01:18:00,216 --> 01:18:02,720
Amazing! The pig's leaving
a vapor trail!

823
01:18:09,185 --> 01:18:12,779
Unbelievable! I haver never seen
a dogfight like this in my life!

824
01:18:12,938 --> 01:18:14,405
They sure are crazy!

825
01:18:24,115 --> 01:18:27,289
The fight's gonna be over!
What's taking her so long?

826
01:18:27,453 --> 01:18:30,127
I dunno. She's in her
room with the door shut.

827
01:18:30,247 --> 01:18:34,002
Boy! I really don't
wanna miss this fight!

828
01:18:35,136 --> 01:18:36,707
Is she coming on not?

829
01:18:46,423 --> 01:18:51,478
Gina, Italians know about the
fighting. Get the pig out of there!

830
01:18:51,573 --> 01:18:52,813
Ferrarin.

831
01:18:57,065 --> 01:18:58,158
Marco! I hope I'm not too late!

832
01:19:17,127 --> 01:19:20,506
I cant believe that
can keep this up.

833
01:19:20,672 --> 01:19:22,801
Looks like the pig's fading.

834
01:19:24,635 --> 01:19:26,979
Go on, Porco hang in there!

835
01:19:31,307 --> 01:19:32,980
You must quit!

836
01:19:38,524 --> 01:19:41,152
I'm not handing Fio over
to a jerk like you!

837
01:19:46,698 --> 01:19:49,042
He's got Curtiss's edge in sight!

838
01:19:49,284 --> 01:19:50,707
It's over!

839
01:19:55,210 --> 01:19:59,052
No! No! Don't jam now!

840
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:04,056
Gotcha!

841
01:20:07,219 --> 01:20:08,891
What?

842
01:20:09,470 --> 01:20:10,893
It can't be jammed!

843
01:20:11,931 --> 01:20:15,060
It's not jammed. You used
up all your ammo, you idiot!

844
01:20:15,685 --> 01:20:18,939
That's not good! And no sucking gun and
thanks to Fio's big butt!

845
01:20:21,358 --> 01:20:24,407
I refuse to end this
fight with a draw!

846
01:20:26,195 --> 01:20:29,416
You stupid cowboy! There's no way
you can hit me with that.

847
01:20:31,909 --> 01:20:33,082
Oh yeah?

848
01:20:35,288 --> 01:20:39,260
You think you can hit me from
there? Cmon give me a break.

849
01:20:47,384 --> 01:20:49,101
You think that's funny?

850
01:20:51,764 --> 01:20:53,805
you're not even cutting close!
Throw somethin' already!

851
01:20:54,224 --> 01:20:55,341
You throw like a girl!

852
01:20:55,458 --> 01:20:56,560
You don't even know
anything about girls!

853
01:20:58,103 --> 01:20:59,149
Shut up, pig!

854
01:21:00,355 --> 01:21:02,108
What's goin' on up there?

855
01:21:02,231 --> 01:21:03,484
Cmon Porco!

856
01:21:12,451 --> 01:21:13,452
They're coming in!

857
01:21:13,702 --> 01:21:16,626
Wait! You're a bet! The
bets can't run off, Fio.

858
01:21:17,122 --> 01:21:20,095
I go where the money goes!
Wait for me!

859
01:21:26,256 --> 01:21:27,632
Why you crazy pig!

860
01:21:29,676 --> 01:21:31,474
Come and get it cowboy!

861
01:21:37,393 --> 01:21:38,770
Cmon put 'em up.

862
01:21:39,103 --> 01:21:40,979
Fight with me, you weakling!

863
01:21:48,095 --> 01:21:49,447
No, Porco!

864
01:21:51,823 --> 01:21:53,497
Get up, Pig

865
01:21:58,122 --> 01:22:00,023
You cheating!
Shut up!

866
01:22:23,479 --> 01:22:26,529
Cmon Porco, Block.
Uppercut!

867
01:22:26,692 --> 01:22:28,034
Yeah! Yeah!
Hit 'em.

868
01:22:28,609 --> 01:22:32,864
Yes! Now we got a boxing match.
The bets are still open!

869
01:22:32,989 --> 01:22:34,832
Taking bets! Taking bets!
Bring a bell up here!

870
01:22:37,886 --> 01:22:40,000
Can't you fly this plane any faster?

871
01:22:40,163 --> 01:22:42,337
Sorry maam, but I'm afraid
the engine will overheat.

872
01:22:43,125 --> 01:22:45,547
Seaplane pilots are all idiots!

873
01:22:51,716 --> 01:22:55,186
Het Fio! Did you see
that left hook I threw?

874
01:22:58,682 --> 01:23:02,231
I'm gonna finish you
off in the next round.

875
01:23:02,810 --> 01:23:04,279
This time I'm send
you to dreamland Curtiss.

876
01:23:04,376 --> 01:23:06,899
Hit him!
Hit him!

877
01:23:07,315 --> 01:23:09,409
I'll wade a pushway you!

878
01:23:11,487 --> 01:23:13,238
Come on, big womanizer!

879
01:23:14,198 --> 01:23:16,371
You're the one who is a womanizer!

880
01:23:18,202 --> 01:23:20,078
You fall in love with
every woman you meet!

881
01:23:20,203 --> 01:23:21,581
Your the one hoggin'
in all the girls...

882
01:23:21,997 --> 01:23:24,420
Just pick one...Gina or Fio.

883
01:23:24,750 --> 01:23:26,092
What are you talkin' about?

884
01:23:28,921 --> 01:23:30,764
You gonna have one!

885
01:23:33,091 --> 01:23:34,467
Gina says hi...

886
01:23:36,520 --> 01:23:39,769
Don't say Gina like you know her!

887
01:23:40,815 --> 01:23:44,610
Gina says she's been waitin' for ya!

888
01:23:48,431 --> 01:23:54,280
For years now, she's been wanting to
meet her in that stupid garden of hers...

889
01:23:57,615 --> 01:24:00,289
She loves you, Pig!

890
01:24:07,626 --> 01:24:08,627
Porco!

891
01:24:08,752 --> 01:24:09,752
The bell sounded the final countdown!

892
01:24:10,978 --> 01:24:12,824
That's a knockout!
Stop!

893
01:24:12,984 --> 01:24:16,225
Round is out! Back to your corner.

894
01:24:19,470 --> 01:24:21,849
There they are!The Air Force
hasn't arrived yet.

895
01:24:26,869 --> 01:24:29,149
End of round 6

896
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:33,000
Round 7

897
01:24:33,109 --> 01:24:36,488
Gina does not want me, liar.

898
01:24:40,283 --> 01:24:42,832
I'm not lying. Why would
I make that up?

899
01:24:43,328 --> 01:24:45,671
So you want Gina?

900
01:24:48,125 --> 01:24:50,172
You can't have Fio!

901
01:24:51,502 --> 01:24:52,550
That's Gina's plane!

902
01:24:55,798 --> 01:24:57,345
Hey its an emergency signal!

903
01:25:08,100 --> 01:25:10,800
1..2..3

904
01:25:10,899 --> 01:25:13,529
Who ever gets up first, wins!

905
01:25:14,484 --> 01:25:16,485
4..5
Excuse me! Let me through please!

906
01:25:18,288 --> 01:25:21,365
6..7
Gina, wait!

907
01:25:24,994 --> 01:25:27,042
Marco. Marco, getup.

908
01:25:30,042 --> 01:25:33,046
I don't wanna see breaking
anymore hearts! You hear me?

909
01:25:39,578 --> 01:25:43,555
9.. Yeee!
Porco!

910
01:25:46,224 --> 01:25:47,270
The winner!

911
01:25:47,391 --> 01:25:49,189
Porco, Thank you!

912
01:25:49,353 --> 01:25:51,902
Yeah, piece of cake.

913
01:25:59,070 --> 01:26:02,917
Okay, listen up everybody. The Italian
Air Force is on its way here.

914
01:26:03,533 --> 01:26:06,810
So anyone in trouble with the Italian
authority better move on out.

915
01:26:06,969 --> 01:26:09,918
Come to the my place.
Drinks are on the house!

916
01:26:11,350 --> 01:26:13,592
Ok gang! Lets squill!

917
01:26:24,300 --> 01:26:26,125
Mr.Curtiss, the fight's over.

918
01:26:28,100 --> 01:26:31,274
Hey Boss! Cmon hurry up!

919
01:26:31,395 --> 01:26:33,488
I'm trying to be classy! You idiot!

920
01:26:35,524 --> 01:26:39,949
You a great seaplane engineer.
Keep it up Ms.Fio.

921
01:26:40,069 --> 01:26:41,287
Bye!

922
01:26:41,529 --> 01:26:44,408
Thank you. And keep up the bathing!

923
01:26:45,199 --> 01:26:47,953
And I want to say thanks
to you too, Mr. Curtiss!

924
01:26:48,078 --> 01:26:51,297
Next time I'll propose
you formally and skip the bet.

925
01:26:51,914 --> 01:26:54,634
Ok. But I already know my answer.

926
01:26:55,292 --> 01:26:57,636
Fio! You're going with Gina.

927
01:26:57,753 --> 01:26:59,301
No!

928
01:26:59,488 --> 01:27:02,934
I'm going with you. You said
we are in on this together.

929
01:27:04,636 --> 01:27:08,265
Gina, take her to her
respectable society please.

930
01:27:10,434 --> 01:27:12,983
You always do this, Marco.
It's just not fair.

931
01:27:15,564 --> 01:27:18,158
Sorry. Off you go.

932
01:27:23,447 --> 01:27:24,448
Let's go.

933
01:27:56,520 --> 01:27:58,694
Here come the Italian Air Force.

934
01:27:58,981 --> 01:28:02,360
I'm gonna draw them from
the others. You wanna help?

935
01:28:03,694 --> 01:28:05,572
Sure. Your face!

936
01:28:06,323 --> 01:28:07,699
Hey wait up! Turn around!
Get away from me!

937
01:28:09,025 --> 01:28:10,578
Cmon, let me see

938
01:28:19,502 --> 01:28:25,886
Porco flew rings around Italian Air force
and they never caught up with him again.

939
01:28:26,510 --> 01:28:29,059
I stayed with Gina for a while
and we became good friends.

940
01:28:32,194 --> 01:28:34,649
But soon I decided, it was
time to go back to Milan.

941
01:28:36,250 --> 01:28:39,113
Through the years there have
been a few wars and a...

942
01:28:39,222 --> 01:28:42,212
good deal of turmoil, but my friendship
with Gina has remained strong.

943
01:28:45,012 --> 01:28:48,113
I am now President of the Piccolo Co.,
and we are busy designing all sorts of...

944
01:28:48,313 --> 01:28:55,112
radical new planes but I take time out
every summer to visit the Hotel  Adriana.

945
01:28:55,247 --> 01:29:00,094
The old pirate gang still
hang out at Gina's Bar.

946
01:29:02,479 --> 01:29:05,000
Mr.Curtiss does write to me sometimes,
although he's yet to become...

947
01:29:05,099 --> 01:29:07,600
the President of the United States.

948
01:29:07,716 --> 01:29:12,644
And he still fondly remembers the
summer in the Adriatic.

949
01:29:14,550 --> 01:29:19,777
And as for how Gina's bet turned out...
well that's our secret!
