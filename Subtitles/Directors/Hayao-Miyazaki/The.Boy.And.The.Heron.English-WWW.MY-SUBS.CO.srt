00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:42,960
- Mister Shoichi?
- His room.

3
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:05,274
Your mother's hospital's on fire!

4
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:14,742
Mother!

5
00:01:19,163 --> 00:01:20,206
I'll go too!

6
00:01:20,331 --> 00:01:22,041
Stay here, Mahito!

7
00:01:58,661 --> 00:01:59,787
<i>Mother...</i>

8
00:02:19,682 --> 00:02:22,268
<i>Three years into the war,
Mother died.</i>

9
00:02:23,185 --> 00:02:26,772
<i>Four years in,
I left Tokyo with Father.</i>

10
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:46,083
<i>"Saginuma Station"</i>

11
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:17,739
That's her.

12
00:03:29,585 --> 00:03:32,129
<i>She looked exactly like Mother.</i>

13
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,673
Did you wait long?

14
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,592
We just arrived.

15
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:40,095
You're Mahito?
I'm Natsuko.

16
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:44,475
Sorry I'm late.
We had a flat tire on the way.

17
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:49,897
You've grown up.

18
00:03:50,022 --> 00:03:53,734
I've met you once,
when you were a baby.

19
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,653
The factory first?

20
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:57,988
Yes. I'll be back for dinner.

21
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:05,329
Perfect timing.

22
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:06,622
Come, let's go.

23
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:08,123
That's heavy.

24
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:12,753
After you.

25
00:04:24,974 --> 00:04:26,058
To the residence.

26
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:40,489
Mahito, I'm going to be your
new mother. Did you know?

27
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:43,867
Your hand.

28
00:04:47,663 --> 00:04:48,956
Go on, put it here.

29
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,251
Feel it moving?

30
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:58,632
A baby. Your little
brother or sister.

31
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:00,551
I'm so delighted.

32
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:02,886
Oh, stop here.

33
00:05:03,012 --> 00:05:06,223
<i>"May your luck last long in battle"
"Congratulations on your call-up"</i>

34
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:58,984
Alright, we're here.

35
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:02,780
Take the luggage in.

36
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,040
Mahito, let's go.

37
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:23,342
It's your first time,
so we'll enter from the front.

38
00:06:28,931 --> 00:06:32,101
Look, over there.
That building.

39
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:35,312
Your father's new factory.

40
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:38,023
Let's visit it sometime.

41
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,586
Oh dear, no one's in.

42
00:07:03,674 --> 00:07:05,425
Bring your shoes with you.

43
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:37,082
How rare. It's never
flown inside before.

44
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:56,226
That nosy gray heron.
It must be welcoming you.

45
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:29,218
Well well.

46
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:32,763
Opened Shoichi's trunk again?

47
00:08:32,888 --> 00:08:34,723
Well, m'lady...

48
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:37,476
The pedicab man came,
ya see!

49
00:08:37,601 --> 00:08:39,519
He left it here.

50
00:08:39,645 --> 00:08:40,603
Yup, yup.

51
00:08:40,604 --> 00:08:42,272
Didn't know whose it was.

52
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:43,523
Yup, yup.

53
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:45,567
It smells so sweet...

54
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:47,444
So we just...

55
00:08:48,612 --> 00:08:52,032
This is Shoichi's son, Mahito.

56
00:09:35,951 --> 00:09:37,911
- What?!
- Canned beef!

57
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:40,330
Tasty when cooked with rice!

58
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:43,166
Canned salmon!
Gimme the bones!

59
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:46,420
Corned beef!
You can still get it?

60
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:48,380
And lastly...

61
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:50,507
- Sugar!
- Good for rice cakes!

62
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:51,758
Sweet bean paste!

63
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:55,262
- Sweet rice cakes!
- Pure white sugar!

64
00:09:55,387 --> 00:09:56,805
Gimme a taste!

65
00:09:56,972 --> 00:09:58,098
Me too!

66
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:00,517
We can go now.

67
00:10:00,684 --> 00:10:03,353
So some places still have it!

68
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:09,151
He's his mother's spitting image.

69
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:10,652
Such a pretty boy.

70
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:12,988
I hope he stays safe...

71
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:14,448
You got smokes?!

72
00:10:14,573 --> 00:10:16,116
Gimme one!

73
00:10:32,424 --> 00:10:34,259
This is your room.

74
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,848
You must be tired.
I'll bring tea.

75
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:35,255
Mom!

76
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:39,426
Mahito...
Goodbye...

77
00:12:40,469 --> 00:12:43,263
Mom! I'm coming!

78
00:12:44,473 --> 00:12:45,599
Mahito...

79
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:48,602
Mahito...

80
00:12:51,563 --> 00:12:52,856
Mom...

81
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:05,238
Mahito!

82
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:10,076
Mahito!

83
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,331
Mahito!

84
00:16:24,693 --> 00:16:27,112
Sonny!

85
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:29,364
Better head back!

86
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:32,117
The lady's worried about ya!

87
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:35,870
Sonny!

88
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,627
That used to be sealed off...

89
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:46,464
He'll get taken...

90
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:48,591
Sonny!

91
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,719
Thank goodness.

92
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:52,011
What is this?

93
00:16:53,263 --> 00:16:56,433
There's a staircase.
What's this place?

94
00:16:57,934 --> 00:16:59,060
Well...

95
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:01,563
Better head back.

96
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,525
The feathers are gone...

97
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:14,492
I was saving this story
for when you get settled in here.

98
00:17:15,744 --> 00:17:20,498
That tower was built by
my mother's uncle, I was told.

99
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,961
He was a very smart man,

100
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:28,882
but read too many books,
and lost his mind.

101
00:17:30,592 --> 00:17:33,720
<i>One day, a long time
before I was born,</i>

102
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:39,392
<i>he disappeared, leaving only
an open book he hadn't finished.</i>

103
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:44,355
<i>They looked everywhere,
but couldn't find any trace.</i>

104
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:50,904
<i>Later, in a flood, a passage
to the main house collapsed,</i>

105
00:17:51,446 --> 00:17:54,949
<i>and beneath the tower,
a maze of tunnels was found.</i>

106
00:17:56,493 --> 00:18:01,080
For safety, my grandfather
had the entrance sealed.

107
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:05,043
You mustn't go near it either.

108
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:08,296
Yes ma'am.
Thank you for the tea.

109
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:12,050
Good night.

110
00:18:12,342 --> 00:18:16,012
Good night. Mornings are cold,
so sleep warm.

111
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:17,180
Yes ma'am.

112
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:20,285
Mahito, save me...

113
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:34,883
You're home.

114
00:19:35,216 --> 00:19:36,217
I'm home.

115
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:14,756
Navy boys are all flustered.

116
00:20:14,923 --> 00:20:17,884
They boasted Saipan
would hold for a year.

117
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,930
I pity those who died...

118
00:20:22,096 --> 00:20:24,432
The factory's booming though.

119
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:27,518
We'll take the Datsun to school.

120
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:33,524
A transfer student arriving by car
will shock everyone.

121
00:20:35,944 --> 00:20:39,948
Don't worry.
We've spoken to the teachers.

122
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:41,407
Off you go.

123
00:20:48,206 --> 00:20:52,210
<i>"Agricultural volunteers"</i>

124
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:02,136
<i>"Mahito Maki"</i>

125
00:22:22,008 --> 00:22:25,762
Mahito, tell me the truth.
Who did this to you?

126
00:22:27,055 --> 00:22:28,639
I just took a tumble.

127
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:35,146
Rest assured. I'll avenge you,
so tell me the truth.

128
00:22:35,271 --> 00:22:36,397
Shoichi...

129
00:22:36,731 --> 00:22:39,150
I won't let them get away with this!

130
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:41,152
I'll go to his school.

131
00:22:51,788 --> 00:22:53,915
Mahito! Save me!

132
00:22:54,248 --> 00:22:55,541
Mahito!

133
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:57,335
Mahito!

134
00:23:11,265 --> 00:23:12,266
Ow!

135
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:19,981
Oh my!

136
00:23:22,443 --> 00:23:23,443
Mahito!

137
00:23:23,486 --> 00:23:24,904
Shut this!

138
00:23:44,257 --> 00:23:47,426
Mom! Mom!

139
00:24:04,694 --> 00:24:07,321
M'lady, please get some rest.

140
00:24:07,488 --> 00:24:11,033
We'll take turns
keeping an eye on him.

141
00:27:15,676 --> 00:27:18,929
What are you?!
Not an ordinary gray heron!

142
00:27:25,102 --> 00:27:29,857
It seems the long-awaited one
has appeared at last.

143
00:27:30,274 --> 00:27:33,527
I shall now guide you to your mother.

144
00:27:34,028 --> 00:27:37,656
My mother?! How dare you!
My mother died!

145
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:45,956
A typical human trick.
She ain't dead.

146
00:27:47,041 --> 00:27:52,046
Pardon me, but you did not
see your mother's dead body.

147
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:59,720
She is awaiting your rescue.

148
00:28:00,054 --> 00:28:01,764
Please join us...

149
00:28:02,473 --> 00:28:04,225
Please join us...

150
00:28:06,727 --> 00:28:07,728
Join us...

151
00:28:08,396 --> 00:28:09,396
Join us...

152
00:28:15,736 --> 00:28:17,863
Mahito!

153
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:21,158
Mahito!

154
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:25,621
Mahito!

155
00:28:38,092 --> 00:28:39,635
Sonny!

156
00:28:41,429 --> 00:28:43,556
Your presence is requested.

157
00:29:33,022 --> 00:29:38,027
You're awake?
Thank heavens.

158
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:47,369
You were out for so long,
and we were so worried.

159
00:29:48,329 --> 00:29:49,538
The gray heron...

160
00:29:49,914 --> 00:29:51,332
Gray heron?

161
00:29:53,334 --> 00:29:54,627
Is it near?

162
00:29:55,169 --> 00:29:56,712
A dream, perhaps?

163
00:29:56,837 --> 00:29:59,381
Mahito! You're awake.

164
00:29:59,507 --> 00:30:03,469
Rest assured.
I'll catch who did this to you.

165
00:30:03,594 --> 00:30:05,137
I was just clumsy.

166
00:30:05,262 --> 00:30:07,848
Don't worry.
No school for now.

167
00:30:08,015 --> 00:30:11,310
I donated 300 yen.
The principal was shocked.

168
00:30:12,102 --> 00:30:16,148
Those teachers barely teach.
Too much voluntary labor.

169
00:30:18,692 --> 00:30:20,861
That might leave a bald spot.

170
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:23,113
It'll get covered up.

171
00:30:25,366 --> 00:30:29,161
Natsuko isn't feeling well.
She's probably tired.

172
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:31,497
Try not to worry her.

173
00:30:35,042 --> 00:30:38,462
The railway's stopped again.
Always accidents.

174
00:30:38,587 --> 00:30:40,047
Get well soon.

175
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,132
Take care of him.

176
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:58,107
Sonny, take it easy and lie down.

177
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:00,985
Bathroom.

178
00:31:02,069 --> 00:31:04,196
But your bedpan's here...

179
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:30,431
Well, a lot's strange
about this place.

180
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:33,309
In many ways.

181
00:32:03,339 --> 00:32:04,715
You well enough?

182
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:06,090
Yes sir.

183
00:32:06,467 --> 00:32:08,052
Magnificent, aren't they?

184
00:32:08,802 --> 00:32:12,389
Can't leave them at the station,
so we came here.

185
00:32:13,557 --> 00:32:15,142
They're beautiful.

186
00:32:15,643 --> 00:32:19,563
Natsuko's worried about you.
Go see her.

187
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:20,980
Yes sir.

188
00:32:21,565 --> 00:32:26,320
Men, well done!
Rest, then return to the factory!

189
00:32:32,993 --> 00:32:36,330
Ain't to your liking, is it?

190
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:37,831
It tastes awful.

191
00:32:38,082 --> 00:32:40,834
Straight talker, huh?

192
00:32:42,836 --> 00:32:45,381
Oh, hey!
You got tobacco?!

193
00:32:48,175 --> 00:32:50,636
Knotweed leaves.
Wanna puff?

194
00:32:50,886 --> 00:32:53,472
Heck nah,
I ain't a caterpillar!

195
00:32:53,597 --> 00:32:56,016
Tobacco's so scarce now.

196
00:32:56,934 --> 00:32:58,143
Thanks for the meal.

197
00:33:08,612 --> 00:33:13,701
The lady of the house keeps saying
she wants to see you.

198
00:33:13,826 --> 00:33:15,661
Pay her a visit.

199
00:33:15,786 --> 00:33:17,204
Is she very sick?

200
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:23,168
Morning sickness. Carrying a baby
causes some women a lotta pain.

201
00:33:23,877 --> 00:33:28,799
Like when you were born.
Your momma had a tough time.

202
00:33:36,557 --> 00:33:37,891
I came to visit.

203
00:34:08,338 --> 00:34:09,548
M'lady...

204
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:40,287
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have
let you get hurt.

205
00:34:42,331 --> 00:34:44,249
Forgive me, big sister...

206
00:34:44,792 --> 00:34:47,795
M'lady, don't make
yourself worse.

207
00:34:48,253 --> 00:34:50,255
Please get well soon.

Something perfect for ya.
The genuine article.

Steel arrowheads,
and a mighty fine bow and all.

Nobody'll know it's gone.

How 'bout one box?

Gramps has them.

And there were only two inside.

She headed for the forest.

The lady did?

235
00:41:44,836 --> 00:41:47,505
A while ago now.
It was bright out.

Surely not!

238
00:41:52,344 --> 00:41:54,095
No gray heron today.

Something's wrong!
Let's go!

240

Let's not! She wouldn't have
gone that way.

Look.

245
00:42:32,425 --> 00:42:33,425
Pavestones.

C-Can't see 'em.
I got night blindness.

Let's go back.

249

Ain't no way the lady
would come here!

250
00:42:45,772 --> 00:42:47,649
Maybe she didn't have a choice.

Return Natsuko to us!

About time you came.
Now, enter.

254
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:30,108
Go back, ma'am.
I'll go.

255
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:35,238
You mustn't go! We maids can't hear
the tower master's voice!

256
00:43:35,739 --> 00:43:38,116
Only your bloodline can!

257
00:43:38,783 --> 00:43:42,746
Then I must go!
I have to bring Aunt Natsuko back!

258
00:43:42,871 --> 00:43:47,876
No! You think you'd be better off
without her, don't ya?

259
00:43:48,376 --> 00:43:50,879
So what's the point in going?!

260
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:53,882
He says my mother's alive.

261
00:43:54,174 --> 00:43:56,801
I know it's a lie,
but I have to see.

Step this way.

266
00:44:45,558 --> 00:44:47,560
It's a trap! A trap!

267
00:44:47,727 --> 00:44:48,853
I know...

268
00:44:48,978 --> 00:44:50,855
If so, then why...?

269
00:45:29,102 --> 00:45:33,606
Here she is.
Your mother.

270
00:45:39,779 --> 00:45:43,616
Why not get closer
and make sure for yourself...

271
00:45:44,284 --> 00:45:46,786
It's a trap. A trap.

272
00:45:50,874 --> 00:45:51,916
Wait, sonny...

273
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:14,481
Mother...

274
00:46:15,607 --> 00:46:16,733
Mother...

275
00:46:17,609 --> 00:46:18,735
Mother!

276
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:20,777
Mo...

277
00:46:43,384 --> 00:46:47,180
What a waste.
One of my better efforts.

278
00:46:47,931 --> 00:46:50,308
Shouldn't have touched her.

279
00:46:50,934 --> 00:46:52,519
How can you do this?!

280
00:46:52,894 --> 00:46:55,855
If you'd like,
I could remake her...

281
00:46:56,231 --> 00:46:58,650
No! Don't dishonor my mother!

282
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:02,111
Angry? My heart is right here.

283
00:47:02,237 --> 00:47:04,656
Best use your one arrow wisely.

284
00:47:05,156 --> 00:47:07,408
Then it's my turn.

285
00:47:07,534 --> 00:47:11,579
I'll bite your arrogant,
lying, swollen heart,

286
00:47:11,704 --> 00:47:13,748
and rip it out!

287
00:47:15,041 --> 00:47:17,043
Weakling, do your worst.

288
00:47:18,127 --> 00:47:19,127
You fail!

289
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:30,056
Get away from me!

290
00:47:31,641 --> 00:47:33,768
Drat! My molted feather!

291
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:49,576
This ain't good...

292
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:53,079
You got 'im!
Nice shooting!

293
00:47:53,204 --> 00:47:55,248
The arrow flew by itself.

294
00:48:11,723 --> 00:48:14,726
No! Not my #7 flight feather!

295
00:48:18,271 --> 00:48:20,690
Dang it!
That wasn't fair!

296
00:48:25,987 --> 00:48:27,155
Don't laugh!

297
00:48:27,947 --> 00:48:30,241
Behold my fearsomeness...

298
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,119
Be gentle...

299
00:48:47,175 --> 00:48:48,301
Let's not do that...

300
00:48:49,135 --> 00:48:50,637
Where is Natsuko?!

301
00:48:50,803 --> 00:48:54,265
Sonny, skewer that turkey!

302
00:48:54,432 --> 00:48:56,768
Hey... Brilliantly done.

303
00:48:58,061 --> 00:49:01,981
So tell me, how did you
figure out my weakness?

304
00:49:02,565 --> 00:49:06,361
You just told me.
It's your #7 flight feather.

305
00:49:06,819 --> 00:49:10,657
Whoopsie daisy!
Loose lips sink ships.

306
00:49:11,157 --> 00:49:13,159
Take me to Natsuko.

307
00:49:14,035 --> 00:49:16,371
I wouldn't go if I were you...

308
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:38,559
Foolish bird.
I command you to be his guide.

309
00:49:43,606 --> 00:49:48,319
No going back now.
You might end up regretting it.

310
00:49:53,950 --> 00:49:55,827
Godspeed, soldier...

311
00:49:58,705 --> 00:50:00,164
Not me too!

312
00:50:03,584 --> 00:50:05,628

00:53:09,729 --> 00:53:12,315
Let's go!
Let's go eat!

318
00:53:12,732 --> 00:53:13,732
Get up!

319
00:53:13,816 --> 00:53:16,235
Walk! Walk!

320
00:53:20,948 --> 00:53:22,950
Someone opened the gate...

321
00:53:54,398 --> 00:53:56,108
Get back, damn birds!

322
00:54:34,605 --> 00:54:35,648
On your feet.

323
00:54:37,775 --> 00:54:38,818
Move.

324
00:54:41,529 --> 00:54:44,073
Move! The buried will wake.

325
00:54:51,497 --> 00:54:52,665
Stand beside me.

326
00:55:22,153 --> 00:55:23,362
It's gone.

327
00:55:24,697 --> 00:55:27,408
Walk backwards.
Don't look back.

328
00:55:37,668 --> 00:55:39,462
Why did you open the gate?!

329
00:55:40,713 --> 00:55:42,298
The pelicans pushed me...

330
00:55:42,465 --> 00:55:43,883
Show me that arrow.

331
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:55,603
The gray heron? No wonder
the pelicans couldn't eat you.

332
00:56:02,318 --> 00:56:06,572
The wind is up.
The tide'll be high. Follow me!

333
00:56:30,179 --> 00:56:31,597
Push!

334
00:56:50,324 --> 00:56:52,618
We've caught the wind!
Come!

335
00:57:03,254 --> 00:57:04,421
That scar...

336
00:57:08,217 --> 00:57:09,510
My plaster came off.

337
00:57:11,804 --> 00:57:13,639
I've got one too. Look.

338
00:57:14,598 --> 00:57:16,267
A swamp thrasher got me.

339
00:57:17,143 --> 00:57:18,435
"Swamp thrasher"?

340
00:57:18,853 --> 00:57:22,022
A massive one.
I ate it though.

341
00:57:22,523 --> 00:57:26,443
A big wave's coming.
After that, plain sailing.

342
00:58:16,785 --> 00:58:18,454
Where'd you come from?

343
00:58:20,039 --> 00:58:21,165
Up above...

344
00:58:22,875 --> 00:58:24,877
Is it a nice place?

345
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:27,922
Not for me.

346
00:58:30,216 --> 00:58:33,344
Have you seen a woman called Natsuko?

347
00:58:34,470 --> 00:58:36,764
Are you sweet on her?

348
00:58:38,974 --> 00:58:43,270
My father is...
I'm trying to find her.

349
00:58:44,730 --> 00:58:46,815
And what are you called?

350
00:58:49,193 --> 00:58:50,193
Mahito.

351
00:58:50,903 --> 00:58:52,613
Meaning "sincere one"...

352
00:58:53,072 --> 00:58:56,575
So that's why you reek of death.

353
00:58:57,576 --> 00:58:58,576
Look.

354
00:59:02,665 --> 00:59:04,333
None are real.

355
00:59:05,251 --> 00:59:08,212
In this world,
the dead are the majority.

356
00:59:13,926 --> 00:59:15,135
Stop rowing.

357
00:59:47,251 --> 00:59:48,544
Who are they?

358
00:59:48,919 --> 00:59:51,380
Buyers coming for our catch.

359
00:59:51,964 --> 00:59:53,507
They saw that flag.

360
00:59:56,218 --> 01:00:00,597
They're not able to kill.
That's my job.

361
01:00:45,517 --> 01:00:47,061
Get off. Help me.

362
01:00:47,686 --> 01:00:49,229
The warawara are coming.

363
01:01:17,716 --> 01:01:19,385
No dilly-dallying!

364
01:01:19,885 --> 01:01:22,054
That fish needs carving!

365
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:36,235
Lend a hand.

366
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:00,801
You try.

367
01:02:06,098 --> 01:02:07,224
Right there.

368
01:02:11,562 --> 01:02:12,729
Deeper!

369
01:02:19,987 --> 01:02:21,572
Pull hard!

370
01:02:31,123 --> 01:02:33,125
Don't spill the guts!

371
01:02:33,876 --> 01:02:36,962
Warawara eat them so they can fly.

372
01:03:32,518 --> 01:03:33,894
Hey, get up and eat.

373
01:03:35,103 --> 01:03:37,481
Don't touch those dolls.

374
01:04:04,675 --> 01:04:08,220
They look like the grannies
at the residence.

375
01:04:10,305 --> 01:04:12,140
They're protecting you.

376
01:04:13,392 --> 01:04:14,935
Water's over there.

377
01:04:39,710 --> 01:04:40,794
Kiriko.

378
01:04:41,420 --> 01:04:44,006
How do you know my damn name?

379
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:46,258
It's Kiriko, right?

380
01:04:46,842 --> 01:04:52,306
This world isn't like mine,
but some things are similar.

381
01:04:52,973 --> 01:04:55,267
I've always been here.

382
01:04:55,892 --> 01:05:00,272
The Kiriko I know
is an old lady, like those dolls.

383
01:05:01,148 --> 01:05:02,482
Hurry up and eat.

384
01:05:03,483 --> 01:05:04,651
Toilet?

385
01:05:05,193 --> 01:05:07,362
Out there, in the yard.

386
01:05:07,738 --> 01:05:08,780
Thank you.

387
01:07:01,143 --> 01:07:02,143
Kiriko!

388
01:07:04,396 --> 01:07:06,022
They mature, then fly.

389
01:07:07,441 --> 01:07:09,943
They haven't flown for so long.

390
01:07:21,246 --> 01:07:22,956
Little ones see them off.

391
01:07:23,290 --> 01:07:25,083
Where are they going?

392
01:07:25,417 --> 01:07:27,419
- To be born.
- What?

393
01:07:27,544 --> 01:07:31,089
Where you came from.
To be born up above.

394
01:07:31,214 --> 01:07:32,340
As people?

395
01:07:32,591 --> 01:07:33,591
What else?

396
01:07:53,403 --> 01:07:56,448
I'm glad we could feed them well.

397
01:08:12,464 --> 01:08:15,509
Pelicans! Dammit,
they'll eat them all!

398
01:08:30,148 --> 01:08:31,148
Lady Himi!

399
01:08:47,207 --> 01:08:48,333
The warawara are burning!

400
01:08:51,962 --> 01:08:55,257
Stop it!
Don't burn the warawara!

401
01:08:56,216 --> 01:08:57,509
Stop!

402
01:09:04,558 --> 01:09:07,518
Damn birds'll stay away for now.

403
01:09:07,519 --> 01:09:10,981
Without Lady Himi,
no more warawara.

404
01:09:11,106 --> 01:09:13,316
Lady Himi! Thank you!

405
01:09:25,745 --> 01:09:28,665
No more'll fly tonight.
Let's eat.

406
01:09:56,735 --> 01:09:59,029
Sorry grannies...

407
01:10:43,198 --> 01:10:46,785
Young one,
put me out of my misery.

408
01:10:46,910 --> 01:10:49,788
My wing is broken.
I cannot fly.

409
01:10:51,081 --> 01:10:53,667
You should've left the warawara alone!

410
01:10:54,793 --> 01:10:58,505
My kind were brought to this hellscape

411
01:10:58,630 --> 01:11:02,300
so we would eat the warawara.

412
01:11:03,218 --> 01:11:06,972
This sea has few fish we can eat.

413
01:11:08,556 --> 01:11:11,434
My kind were all starving.

414
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:15,647
<i>We flew as high as we could.</i>

415
01:11:15,855 --> 01:11:19,609
<i>As high and far
as our wings could carry us.</i>

416
01:11:20,110 --> 01:11:24,197
But... it always ended the same way.

417
01:11:24,447 --> 01:11:27,033
We could only reach this island.

418
01:11:31,162 --> 01:11:35,166
Now our newborns
are forgetting how to fly.

419
01:11:35,917 --> 01:11:38,837
We eat the warawara...

420
01:11:38,962 --> 01:11:41,923
The fire maiden burns us...

421
01:11:45,677 --> 01:11:50,473
The sea here...
is cursed...

422
01:11:57,856 --> 01:12:02,110
Rest in peace.
It was such a noble pelican...

423
01:12:06,990 --> 01:12:10,785
Ah! You still have that?

424
01:12:11,036 --> 01:12:12,328
Hey, wait!

425
01:12:16,541 --> 01:12:18,918
Natsuko isn't here,
you know.

426
01:12:19,044 --> 01:12:20,128
I know.

427
01:12:21,004 --> 01:12:23,214
How about I take you to her?

428
01:12:24,132 --> 01:12:25,884
I'll find her myself.

429
01:12:27,719 --> 01:12:30,096
Wait. Hey, chief!

430
01:12:36,227 --> 01:12:38,354
Arrogant little turd!

431
01:12:48,114 --> 01:12:49,449
You'll bury it...?

432
01:13:05,965 --> 01:13:06,965
Okay!

433
01:13:07,008 --> 01:13:08,843
I'm such a pushover.

434
01:13:08,968 --> 01:13:10,011
Stop!

435
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:13,098
Too far! Come back.

436
01:13:14,265 --> 01:13:15,266
Alright.

437
01:13:18,103 --> 01:13:19,729
I can't stomach this.

438
01:13:20,855 --> 01:13:23,566
Don't blame me if
Natsuko gets eaten.

439
01:13:24,109 --> 01:13:26,820
You said you'd eat my heart.

440
01:13:32,575 --> 01:13:33,575
Sorry...

441
01:13:33,868 --> 01:13:35,036
Ow!

442
01:13:37,956 --> 01:13:40,792
Spit it out.
Where is Natsuko?!

443
01:13:42,293 --> 01:13:43,293
I'll rip this!

444
01:13:43,753 --> 01:13:46,297
Try it!
I'll tear you apart!

445
01:13:48,174 --> 01:13:51,636
Ow ow ow!
Please stop!

446
01:13:52,137 --> 01:13:54,681
You okay?
I hardly ripped it.

447
01:13:58,977 --> 01:13:59,977
It's ripped now.

448
01:14:15,368 --> 01:14:19,497
This is crummy tea,
but drink and make up.

449
01:14:20,248 --> 01:14:22,375
We didn't fight.

450
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:26,921
He's a liar and a cheat,
but I know he took Natsuko.

451
01:14:27,046 --> 01:14:30,425
I hate to say it,
but you overestimate me.

452
01:14:30,550 --> 01:14:32,969
The wise cheat to survive.

453
01:14:33,428 --> 01:14:37,140
A gray heron told me
all gray herons are liars.

454
01:14:37,390 --> 01:14:39,726
Is that the truth,
or a lie?

455
01:14:40,185 --> 01:14:41,477
- A lie!
- The truth!

456
01:14:42,270 --> 01:14:46,399
It's the truth.
All gray herons are liars.

457
01:14:46,733 --> 01:14:47,942
That's a lie too!

458
01:14:48,067 --> 01:14:49,611
This lie is true.

459
01:14:53,489 --> 01:14:57,827
You're a fine pair.
Go search for Natsuko together.

460
01:14:58,661 --> 01:15:00,872
I have to tend to the warawara.

461
01:15:01,039 --> 01:15:03,875
The tower master
told you to guide him.

462
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:07,545
Stay vigilant,
and work together. Go.

463
01:15:24,187 --> 01:15:25,355
It's Kiriko!

464
01:15:25,730 --> 01:15:27,899
For good luck.
Take it.

465
01:15:28,858 --> 01:15:30,109
Will we meet again?

466
01:15:30,235 --> 01:15:31,361
Who knows?

467
01:15:31,694 --> 01:15:32,820
Thank you!

468
01:15:33,196 --> 01:15:34,364
Do your best.

469
01:15:44,749 --> 01:15:46,251
Miss Natsuko!

470
01:15:47,585 --> 01:15:49,254
Miss Natsuko!

471
01:15:53,383 --> 01:15:56,094
I'll get some men to stay here!

472
01:15:56,219 --> 01:16:01,099
No, the factory mustn't stop.
Please return to your work.

473
01:16:01,224 --> 01:16:03,810
Alright! We'll always be on call!

474
01:16:03,935 --> 01:16:05,520
Okay. Thanks.

475
01:16:16,531 --> 01:16:20,827
We've searched the pond,
the hills, everywhere.

476
01:16:21,202 --> 01:16:23,746
Natsuko, Mahito, and Kiriko.

477
01:16:24,122 --> 01:16:27,250
A triple disappearance is unheard of.

478
01:16:27,417 --> 01:16:29,419
Say, Mister Shoichi...

479
01:16:30,169 --> 01:16:34,215
Every now and then,
strange things happen here...

480
01:16:34,674 --> 01:16:39,470
I've been working here
for a good 60 years now,

481
01:16:39,846 --> 01:16:44,225
and that tower out in the yard
just ain't right.

482
01:16:45,685 --> 01:16:49,105
That thing sure weren't
built by people.

483
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:51,733
Oh come on,
scary stories now?

484
01:16:52,358 --> 01:16:56,571
Just before the Meiji Revolution,
it fell outta the sky!

485
01:17:04,829 --> 01:17:08,958
Rumble rumble,
BOOOOOM!

486
01:17:10,168 --> 01:17:12,879
With an earth-rattling crash.

487
01:17:13,421 --> 01:17:14,881
Like thunder?

488
01:17:15,006 --> 01:17:20,928
There used to be a big pond,
but the water all dried up.

489
01:17:21,054 --> 01:17:23,681
That tower stands there now.

490
01:17:38,029 --> 01:17:42,825
From what I heard,
Natsuko's clever granduncle had it built.

491
01:17:43,034 --> 01:17:46,579
No siree,
it came down from the sky!

492
01:17:46,704 --> 01:17:49,999
Everybody was
too scared to go near it.

493
01:17:50,708 --> 01:17:55,755
<i>After 30-odd years, the forest
grew back, and the thing got buried.</i>

494
01:17:56,631 --> 01:18:00,385
<i>Then, the granduncle discovered it.</i>

495
01:18:00,885 --> 01:18:03,638
He became obsessed with it...

496
01:18:03,763 --> 01:18:08,601
Because it was so rare,
he built the tower around it.

497
01:18:20,988 --> 01:18:24,242
So many people died or got hurt.

498
01:18:24,367 --> 01:18:28,162
Plus, the granduncle
vanished into the tower...

499
01:18:28,287 --> 01:18:29,705
He sure did.

500
01:18:30,456 --> 01:18:36,045
Mahito's mother Hisako
also went missing once.

501
01:18:37,588 --> 01:18:40,675
<i>We searched the whole village.</i>

502
01:18:41,134 --> 01:18:45,304
<i>Then after a year,
she came back, fit as a fiddle.</i>

503
01:18:45,763 --> 01:18:48,599
Looking the same as she was before.

504
01:18:48,766 --> 01:18:53,062
No memory of it,
and grinning, but...

505
01:18:54,272 --> 01:18:55,690
Bizarre, ain't it?

506
01:18:57,817 --> 01:18:59,318
We have the tower key?

507
01:18:59,777 --> 01:19:01,446
Yessir, I think...

508
01:19:01,612 --> 01:19:02,905
I'll go there now.

509
01:19:21,174 --> 01:19:22,550
I'm pooped...

510
01:19:24,260 --> 01:19:27,346
These legs weren't made for walking.

511
01:19:28,473 --> 01:19:32,435
I won't be able to make it
to where Natsuko is.

512
01:19:32,727 --> 01:19:36,397
If only I could block this hole,
I could fly...

513
01:19:37,106 --> 01:19:38,941
Shove a stick in it or something.

514
01:19:39,734 --> 01:19:44,822
Easy to say. The hole maker
has to fill it, or it won't work!

515
01:19:45,490 --> 01:19:47,617
Is that lie true?

516
01:19:47,742 --> 01:19:49,994
I never tell lies!

517
01:19:55,166 --> 01:19:57,210
Be gentle...

518
01:20:06,594 --> 01:20:09,013
Make that part smoother...

519
01:20:09,180 --> 01:20:10,389
Shut up.

520
01:20:13,100 --> 01:20:17,104
It's through! Gently,
or you'll break your beak.

521
01:20:19,565 --> 01:20:20,608
How's that?

522
01:20:29,283 --> 01:20:33,329
Look at me,
gorgeous and powerful!

523
01:20:34,705 --> 01:20:36,165
Can you fly?

524
01:20:38,501 --> 01:20:42,255
I ain't your friend or your ally, kid.

525
01:20:43,756 --> 01:20:49,011
So long. You'll have to find Natsuko,
and get out of here,

526
01:20:49,136 --> 01:20:51,806
all on your lonesome...

527
01:20:59,397 --> 01:21:00,606
It came out?

528
01:21:00,940 --> 01:21:02,650
No, it just...

529
01:21:03,818 --> 01:21:06,279
It sticks out a wee bit, so...

530
01:21:06,696 --> 01:21:09,615
Here! This part bugs me!

531
01:21:09,865 --> 01:21:12,952
There! There!
Oh, don't take too much off...

532
01:21:13,077 --> 01:21:14,579
Shut up.

533
01:21:19,250 --> 01:21:20,418
It's a home.

534
01:21:20,543 --> 01:21:23,879
The blacksmith's.
Shh! Duck down!

535
01:21:28,551 --> 01:21:29,927
That's a big parakeet.

536
01:21:30,094 --> 01:21:33,806
Weird... Why are they
hanging around?

537
01:21:34,015 --> 01:21:35,766
They ate the blacksmith?

538
01:21:35,975 --> 01:21:37,351
They eat people?!

539
01:21:37,476 --> 01:21:39,186
Elephants too.

540
01:21:40,271 --> 01:21:44,859
Like the pelicans, the master
brought them, and they bred.

541
01:21:46,402 --> 01:21:51,115
Gotta pass through there,
or you can't get to Natsuko.

542
01:21:51,949 --> 01:21:55,077
I'll draw 'em out,
then you dash in.

543
01:21:55,202 --> 01:21:56,287
I'll try.

544
01:22:58,766 --> 01:23:00,559
We have been waiting.

545
01:23:01,936 --> 01:23:05,940
Is there a Natsuko here?
I'm looking for her.

546
01:23:06,941 --> 01:23:08,609
This way, sir.

547
01:23:30,631 --> 01:23:31,632
This way.

548
01:23:32,550 --> 01:23:35,720
Damn you!
Is this how you ate Natsuko?!

549
01:23:36,220 --> 01:23:38,305
Natsuko has baby.

550
01:23:38,431 --> 01:23:39,807
We not eat baby.

551
01:23:40,307 --> 01:23:42,059
You not have baby.

552
01:23:42,226 --> 01:23:43,769
Eatable! Eatable!

553
01:23:46,522 --> 01:23:47,982
Himi! It's Himi!

554
01:24:04,999 --> 01:24:08,461
Stupid. Those parakeets
nearly stewed you.

555
01:24:09,420 --> 01:24:13,174
You're Himi?
Thank you for saving my life.

556
01:24:14,091 --> 01:24:17,094
You're that brat
who was with Kiriko.

557
01:24:17,887 --> 01:24:21,724
I'm Mahito. I'm looking
for someone called Natsuko.

558
01:24:22,266 --> 01:24:24,185
Natsuko...
My little sister?

559
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:26,103
"Little sister"?!

560
01:24:29,273 --> 01:24:30,274
Come.

561
01:24:31,484 --> 01:24:32,568
Time's wasting.

562
01:25:07,561 --> 01:25:08,896
This is my home.

563
01:25:42,721 --> 01:25:44,807
It's like a tower I know.

564
01:25:45,015 --> 01:25:47,142
Sure, it's the same one.

565
01:25:47,351 --> 01:25:50,855
It stands straddling
all kinds of worlds.

566
01:25:51,146 --> 01:25:52,231
Come in.

567
01:26:21,719 --> 01:26:22,720
Eat it.

568
01:26:23,679 --> 01:26:25,806
Hurry, the jam'll drip.

569
01:26:33,731 --> 01:26:36,317
Kiriko loves my bread too.

570
01:26:39,695 --> 01:26:40,988
It's delicious!

571
01:26:41,530 --> 01:26:44,783
It's like the bread
my mother used to bake!

572
01:26:45,784 --> 01:26:47,828
Natsuko is your mother?

573
01:26:48,287 --> 01:26:49,371
She's not.

574
01:26:49,955 --> 01:26:53,459
Natsuko is someone...
my father likes.

575
01:26:54,126 --> 01:26:55,920
My mother died.

576
01:26:56,420 --> 01:26:57,713
As did mine.

577
01:26:59,340 --> 01:27:02,635
Eat lots. We'll be going
deep inside.

578
01:27:08,974 --> 01:27:12,019
Careful. You get lost,
you never get out.

579
01:27:21,070 --> 01:27:22,237
It's guarded...

580
01:27:44,051 --> 01:27:48,222
Careful. In here,
my power has limits.

581
01:27:50,349 --> 01:27:51,433
This way.

582
01:28:01,110 --> 01:28:02,152
Doors to where?

583
01:28:02,319 --> 01:28:04,154
Quiet. You'll mess me up.

584
01:28:10,661 --> 01:28:11,661
This one.

585
01:28:14,331 --> 01:28:15,958
Don't get sucked in.

586
01:28:20,671 --> 01:28:21,672
Father?!

587
01:28:22,089 --> 01:28:23,674
That's your father?

588
01:28:24,425 --> 01:28:27,177
If you want to go home,
open this.

589
01:28:27,344 --> 01:28:30,180
But Natsuko...
I can't leave alone!

590
01:28:30,305 --> 01:28:33,934
She doesn't want to leave.
She'll have her baby.

591
01:28:36,979 --> 01:28:38,105
Parakeets!

592
01:28:44,028 --> 01:28:47,031
We're trapped.
In here! Turn it hard!

593
01:28:47,448 --> 01:28:49,867
You mustn't let go.
Ready?

594
01:28:51,368 --> 01:28:54,413
Grab the other knob!
Shut the door!

595
01:29:00,210 --> 01:29:02,129
- Where are we?
- Hold on!

596
01:29:03,547 --> 01:29:06,341
Once you let go,
it's lost forever.

597
01:29:18,270 --> 01:29:19,480
It's Mahito!

598
01:29:21,106 --> 01:29:22,483
Mahito!

599
01:29:23,776 --> 01:29:25,736
- Father!
- Want to stay?

600
01:29:26,070 --> 01:29:27,237
Just let go.

601
01:29:27,529 --> 01:29:29,239
Not without Natsuko!

602
01:29:36,830 --> 01:29:38,791
Taste my blade, monsters!

603
01:29:52,971 --> 01:29:55,140
Mahito turned into a parakeet...

604
01:29:55,766 --> 01:29:57,059
Father, I'm sorry.

605
01:29:58,477 --> 01:30:00,020
Mister Shoichi...

606
01:30:00,270 --> 01:30:03,232
Mahito's a budgie now!

607
01:30:39,184 --> 01:30:40,519
Don't touch the stone.

608
01:30:41,061 --> 01:30:43,480
It's not happy we're here.

609
01:30:52,739 --> 01:30:55,534
The delivery room.
Natsuko's there.

610
01:30:59,746 --> 01:31:03,417
The stone's aware of us,
and upset. I wouldn't go in.

611
01:31:05,043 --> 01:31:06,211
I have to go.

612
01:31:07,588 --> 01:31:08,672
I'll wait here.

613
01:31:58,805 --> 01:32:01,725
Natsuko, it's Mahito.
Natsuko?

614
01:32:20,369 --> 01:32:24,331
Natsuko, it's Mahito!
I've come for you!

615
01:32:24,748 --> 01:32:27,209
Natsuko! Let's go home!

616
01:32:30,879 --> 01:32:33,674
You... What are you doing here?!

617
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:37,427
Go back! Now!

618
01:32:41,139 --> 01:32:42,307
Let's go together!

619
01:32:43,684 --> 01:32:46,311
I absolutely hate you!
Get out!

620
01:32:49,940 --> 01:32:52,150
Go back! Now!

621
01:33:01,827 --> 01:33:04,121
Natsuko...
Mother!

622
01:33:08,583 --> 01:33:09,710
Mother!

623
01:33:13,297 --> 01:33:15,257
Mother! Let's go home!

624
01:33:24,766 --> 01:33:26,184
Mahito, run!

625
01:33:29,646 --> 01:33:31,231
Natsuko! Mother!

626
01:34:17,527 --> 01:34:21,406
Master of the great stone,
hear my plea.

627
01:34:22,574 --> 01:34:26,036
Let my sister lying there...
go home...

628
01:34:26,453 --> 01:34:29,373
...with this boy
who will be her son.

629
01:34:32,834 --> 01:34:37,089
Natsuko. Natsuko.
Come to me.

630
01:34:37,631 --> 01:34:39,383
Up you get.

631
01:34:44,888 --> 01:34:48,350
That's it. Good girl.
Come to me.

632
01:36:34,247 --> 01:36:37,626
You have come,
my descendant.

633
01:36:41,588 --> 01:36:43,006
My name is Mahito.

634
01:36:43,673 --> 01:36:46,676
You're the tower master?
My great-granduncle?

635
01:36:47,469 --> 01:36:50,764
Wait there. Quietly.

636
01:37:19,417 --> 01:37:21,044
Now this world...

637
01:37:23,046 --> 01:37:25,298
...will last another day.

638
01:37:26,758 --> 01:37:30,262
Another day?!
It only lasts that long?

639
01:37:31,179 --> 01:37:32,264
Come.

640
01:38:29,112 --> 01:38:30,572
My world,

641
01:38:31,197 --> 01:38:35,994
my power, everything,
comes from this stone.

642
01:38:36,786 --> 01:38:39,914
That stone created this sea world?

643
01:38:40,915 --> 01:38:43,001
There is more to be done.

644
01:38:43,627 --> 01:38:47,922
Worlds are living things.
Mold and bugs infest them.

645
01:38:48,506 --> 01:38:50,675
And I have grown old.

646
01:38:50,884 --> 01:38:53,637
I seek a successor.

647
01:38:56,222 --> 01:39:00,060
Mahito, will you continue my work?

648
01:39:00,935 --> 01:39:02,062
Me...?

649
01:39:02,520 --> 01:39:07,525
My successor must come
from my bloodline.

650
01:39:07,651 --> 01:39:10,153
That is my contract with the stone.

651
01:39:10,945 --> 01:39:13,990
Whether this world becomes beautiful,

652
01:39:14,157 --> 01:39:18,036
or an abomination,
is entirely in your hands.

653
01:39:18,703 --> 01:39:20,455
You mean your blocks?

654
01:39:22,165 --> 01:39:25,502
You may add one of these blocks to it.

655
01:39:31,633 --> 01:39:36,012
You can make this world
a more harmonious place.

656
01:39:39,974 --> 01:39:41,643
Those aren't wooden.

657
01:39:42,143 --> 01:39:45,105
It's stone for making tombs.
It's malicious.

658
01:39:49,401 --> 01:39:50,694
Correct.

659
01:39:50,819 --> 01:39:53,738
That knowledge is why I choose you.

660
01:40:45,248 --> 01:40:46,249
Thank you!

661
01:40:46,583 --> 01:40:47,917
Save the chit-chat!

662
01:41:09,481 --> 01:41:10,774
Himi's been caught.

663
01:41:11,065 --> 01:41:12,233
She'll be fine.

664
01:41:12,358 --> 01:41:13,485
We must save her!

665
01:42:09,499 --> 01:42:10,834
Is Himi alright?

666
01:42:10,959 --> 01:42:13,378
They'll take her to their lord.

667
01:42:13,503 --> 01:42:14,546
Their lord?

668
01:42:14,671 --> 01:42:16,297
Your great-granduncle.

669
01:42:17,632 --> 01:42:21,010
They'll use her
to make a deal with him.

670
01:42:21,135 --> 01:42:22,303
A deal?

671
01:42:22,762 --> 01:42:24,931
So they get everything.

672
01:42:25,223 --> 01:42:28,017
The tower's full of parakeets now.

673
01:42:28,935 --> 01:42:31,980
Your transgression
gave them an excuse.

674
01:42:32,146 --> 01:42:33,398
"Transgression"?

675
01:42:33,523 --> 01:42:37,110
The taboo.
You entered the delivery room.

676
01:42:37,235 --> 01:42:38,361
A no-no.

677
01:42:40,864 --> 01:42:42,824
But Himi didn't enter.

678
01:42:42,949 --> 01:42:44,993
Taking you was taboo too.

679
01:42:46,244 --> 01:42:47,787
This is a lookout.

680
01:42:52,542 --> 01:42:53,585
Higher!

681
01:43:00,884 --> 01:43:04,762
Subjects, this is far enough!
Await good news!

682
01:43:05,513 --> 01:43:07,557
Let us accompany you!

683
01:43:07,724 --> 01:43:09,350
Please let us!

684
01:43:10,810 --> 01:43:15,899
Your sincerity is appreciated!
However, this is my duty.

685
01:43:16,232 --> 01:43:18,067
Subjects, live well!

686
01:43:21,112 --> 01:43:23,948
Three cheers for our parakeet king!

687
01:45:12,015 --> 01:45:13,307
Be still!

688
01:45:13,683 --> 01:45:17,645
We carry Lady Himi,
our lord's descendant!

689
01:45:18,271 --> 01:45:19,731
Yield to us!

690
01:45:29,073 --> 01:45:30,450
H-Heaven!

691
01:45:30,575 --> 01:45:31,909
Our ancestors!

692
01:45:35,121 --> 01:45:36,205
Paradise!

693
01:45:36,330 --> 01:45:38,708
Your Majesty,
is this paradise?

694
01:45:39,792 --> 01:45:41,044
Be silent.

695
01:45:41,419 --> 01:45:42,712
Look at that!

696
01:45:42,920 --> 01:45:44,338
So pretty...

697
01:46:02,440 --> 01:46:05,401
So, you made it.
Have a seat.

698
01:46:06,194 --> 01:46:08,029
No, we shall walk.

699
01:46:29,258 --> 01:46:32,428
Entering the delivery room was wrong.

700
01:46:32,553 --> 01:46:36,641
It is no laughing matter.
A grave transgression.

701
01:46:37,809 --> 01:46:42,230
Unquestionably. The stone
is shimmering dangerously.

702
01:46:42,772 --> 01:46:45,691
Nevertheless,
young souls are precious.

703
01:46:46,776 --> 01:46:50,655
As king, I cannot
disregard a transgressor.

704
01:46:51,489 --> 01:46:56,702
Give me time. I want Mahito
to become my successor.

705
01:47:22,311 --> 01:47:23,437
Granduncle...

706
01:47:26,023 --> 01:47:29,318
We must protect our world,
or it shall perish.

707
01:47:29,902 --> 01:47:34,866
Mahito is a good boy.
It seems I must let him go.

708
01:47:38,995 --> 01:47:40,121
Granduncle!

709
01:47:43,457 --> 01:47:45,042
You must go too.

710
01:48:07,982 --> 01:48:09,483
Th-That's it!

711
01:48:09,734 --> 01:48:10,985
That passage.

712
01:48:25,875 --> 01:48:27,668
I've been here before.

713
01:48:27,793 --> 01:48:28,878
Yow! Youch!

714
01:48:33,758 --> 01:48:37,136
I've never been this far in before...

715
01:48:47,730 --> 01:48:49,815
We should return, Majesty!

716
01:48:49,941 --> 01:48:53,611
I shall go. Make sure you
make it back alive,

717
01:48:54,237 --> 01:48:56,614
and tell them I was a true king.

718
01:48:56,739 --> 01:48:58,532
- We will!
- Fare thee well!

719
01:49:37,363 --> 01:49:41,284
Hey chief, ain't it time
we got outta here?

720
01:49:41,409 --> 01:49:43,536
This way. Himi's calling.

721
01:49:44,078 --> 01:49:46,580
I can't hear diddly-squat...

722
01:49:48,916 --> 01:49:50,042
Himi!

723
01:49:54,797 --> 01:49:55,923
Mahito!

724
01:49:59,427 --> 01:50:02,638
Himi! Are you alright?!
Did they hurt you?!

725
01:50:02,805 --> 01:50:03,848
No!

726
01:50:04,724 --> 01:50:07,977
I thought I'd lost you.
I'm so glad!

727
01:50:14,108 --> 01:50:16,110
Granduncle's waiting for you.

728
01:50:16,360 --> 01:50:18,362
I know. I'll go to him.

729
01:50:18,571 --> 01:50:20,906
This feels wrong. Don't...

730
01:50:21,032 --> 01:50:22,074
Let's go.

731
01:50:26,454 --> 01:50:27,496
Huh?

732
01:50:33,002 --> 01:50:34,712
It's getting dark!

733
01:51:07,536 --> 01:51:08,913
Stone blocks...

734
01:51:10,915 --> 01:51:14,460
Better not touch them.
They're still powerful...

735
01:51:39,985 --> 01:51:42,905
Granduncle,
I've brought Mahito.

736
01:51:43,406 --> 01:51:44,448
Here I am.

737
01:51:48,244 --> 01:51:52,456
Look. These stones
are not stained with malice.

738
01:52:02,299 --> 01:52:07,054
I traveled the far reaches of
time and space to find them.

739
01:52:09,181 --> 01:52:14,437
There are 13 in all.
Stack them once every three days.

740
01:52:15,229 --> 01:52:20,568
Build your own tower.
A kingdom freed from malice.

741
01:52:22,445 --> 01:52:26,949
Create a world of bounty,
peace, and beauty.

742
01:52:39,628 --> 01:52:41,630
I made this scar myself.

743
01:52:42,798 --> 01:52:44,925
It's a sign of my malice.

744
01:52:47,428 --> 01:52:49,430
I can't touch those stones.

745
01:52:50,097 --> 01:52:52,850
I'll go back with Natsuko,
my mother.

746
01:52:53,851 --> 01:52:58,939
You'll return to a foolish world
of rampant murder and thievery?

747
01:52:59,773 --> 01:53:02,443
Soon it shall be consumed by flames.

748
01:53:03,068 --> 01:53:07,323
I'll make friends. Like Himi,
Kiriko, and the heron man.

749
01:53:08,324 --> 01:53:09,324
Me?

750
01:53:09,700 --> 01:53:15,289
Make friends. Return to your world.
But first, stack the stones.

751
01:53:15,956 --> 01:53:17,416
There is no time!

752
01:53:18,042 --> 01:53:20,419
<i>I cannot keep my tower standing.</i>

753
01:53:31,096 --> 01:53:36,352
Traitor! You would place the fate
of the empire upon mere stones?!

754
01:53:44,151 --> 01:53:45,945
B-Be still. Still.

755
01:53:47,071 --> 01:53:48,155
Damn you!

756
01:54:00,292 --> 01:54:04,004
Himi! Mahito!
Return to the corridor of time!

757
01:54:04,129 --> 01:54:05,589
To your own time!

758
01:54:06,382 --> 01:54:07,758
Granduncle!

759
01:54:18,978 --> 01:54:22,106
The planet's splitting!
Grab on!

760
01:54:24,775 --> 01:54:26,277
Too much...

761
01:54:42,751 --> 01:54:45,045
Granduncle! Thank you!

762
01:54:46,547 --> 01:54:47,548
Come on!

763
01:54:50,217 --> 01:54:51,594
Hurry, hurry!

764
01:55:17,620 --> 01:55:18,954
Miss Natsuko!

765
01:55:30,883 --> 01:55:32,801
This is it!
Mahito, you go in.

766
01:55:32,968 --> 01:55:34,178
What about you?!

767
01:55:35,012 --> 01:55:38,474
Mine's another.
I'm going to be your mother.

768
01:55:39,016 --> 01:55:41,310
But you'll die in the hospital fire!

769
01:55:41,810 --> 01:55:45,481
Fire doesn't scare me.
I'll be so lucky to have you.

770
01:55:45,606 --> 01:55:48,150
No! Himi, you've got to live!

771
01:55:48,359 --> 01:55:50,361
You're a good boy!

772
01:55:56,617 --> 01:55:57,701
Holy moly!

773
01:56:00,287 --> 01:56:02,164
- Mother!
- Mahito!

774
01:56:02,289 --> 01:56:03,374
Thank goodness!

775
01:56:03,499 --> 01:56:06,502
- Sister!
- All the best for the birth.

776
01:56:06,669 --> 01:56:07,711
Now, hurry.

777
01:56:36,740 --> 01:56:38,325
How adorable!

778
01:57:02,683 --> 01:57:05,102
Hey! This way!

779
01:57:13,861 --> 01:57:17,364
Good. The pelicans made it out too.

780
01:57:17,573 --> 01:57:19,116
Hey, Mahito.

781
01:57:20,242 --> 01:57:22,911
Do you remember where we were?

782
01:57:23,245 --> 01:57:24,455
Of course I do.

783
01:57:24,580 --> 01:57:26,415
That's bad. Forget.

784
01:57:26,540 --> 01:57:27,541
Why?

785
01:57:27,666 --> 01:57:29,376
Forgetting is normal.

786
01:57:31,253 --> 01:57:33,130
No keepsakes, right?

787
01:57:40,929 --> 01:57:45,726
That's a powerful charm.
Way too powerful for me...

788
01:57:46,560 --> 01:57:48,812
That's one of them stones.

789
01:57:49,146 --> 01:57:51,607
From that field full of them.

790
01:57:51,899 --> 01:57:54,193
Can't trust amateurs like you.

791
01:57:54,943 --> 01:57:57,529
Well, that stone ain't powerful.

792
01:57:57,863 --> 01:58:00,240
You'll forget in time.
You should.

793
01:58:05,537 --> 01:58:07,623
So long, friend.

794
01:58:20,052 --> 01:58:22,012
Ow ow ow! Yeesh...

795
01:58:22,137 --> 01:58:23,180
Kiriko!

796
01:58:24,723 --> 01:58:25,723
The king?!

797
01:58:36,068 --> 01:58:38,320
Natsuko! Mahito!

798
01:58:38,487 --> 01:58:40,113
- Shoichi!
- Father!

799
01:58:47,538 --> 01:58:49,373
<i>Two years after the war,</i>

800
01:58:51,500 --> 01:58:52,960
<i>we returned to Tokyo.</i>

801
01:58:55,754 --> 01:58:57,673
Hey! Mahito!

802
01:58:59,174 --> 01:59:00,342
We're going!

803
01:59:01,426 --> 01:59:02,761
Coming!

804
01:59:38,171 --> 01:59:43,844
<i>The clear sky on the day I was born</i>

805
01:59:45,470 --> 01:59:51,435
<i>was so high, distant, and endless</i>

806
01:59:53,520 --> 01:59:59,318
<i>The day I heard a voice
patting me on the back</i>

807
02:00:00,944 --> 02:00:05,282
<i>telling me to go ahead</i>

808
02:00:07,409 --> 02:00:13,081
<i>Faces I met in the seasons,</i>

809
02:00:14,708 --> 02:00:20,714
<i>at times hurting one another</i>

810
02:00:22,758 --> 02:00:28,555
<i>Shine by the light, the shadow extends</i>

811
02:00:29,890 --> 02:00:34,519
<i>as the sky grows further away</i>

812
02:00:39,316 --> 02:00:45,322
<i>I catch the wind and start running,
overcoming the rubble</i>

813
02:00:45,447 --> 02:00:51,453
<i>At the end of this road,
someone is waiting for me</i>

814
02:00:51,620 --> 02:00:58,620
<i>Dream of light shining through,
at any day of the week</i>

815
02:01:00,879 --> 02:01:06,927
<i>Open the door this moment,
like revealing hidden secrets</i>

816
02:01:07,052 --> 02:01:13,433
<i>Can't hold myself longing for more,
like the spinning globe</i>

817
02:01:25,862 --> 02:01:31,368
<i>The person I loved</i>

818
02:01:33,161 --> 02:01:39,167
<i>has gone to somewhere no one knows</i>

819
02:01:41,294 --> 02:01:46,967
<i>With the usual kind
smile as any other day,</i>

820
02:01:48,552 --> 02:01:52,889
<i>still somewhere far away</i>

821
02:01:57,686 --> 02:02:03,859
<i>I take in the rain and start singing,
not minding if seen</i>

822
02:02:03,984 --> 02:02:09,948
<i>This road continues
because I wished it would continue</i>

823
02:02:10,073 --> 02:02:17,073
<i>I dream of meeting again,
for ever and ever</i>

824
02:02:19,291 --> 02:02:25,213
<i>I grasped the fragment firmly,
so the secret remains</i>

825
02:02:25,380 --> 02:02:31,803
<i>I'll keep longing till the end,
like the spinning globe</i>

826
02:02:38,018 --> 02:02:44,775
<i>It all starts from an innocent wish
made long ago</i>

827
02:02:45,859 --> 02:02:52,859
<i>Carrying the loneliness in my heart,
I turn the corner</i>

828
