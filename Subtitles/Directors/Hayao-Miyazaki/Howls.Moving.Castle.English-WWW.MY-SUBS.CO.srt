HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE

6
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:40,697
Sophie.

7
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:43,193
We just closed the shop,
you've done enough work.

8
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:45,604
Why don't you come out
with us this time?

9
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:48,931
No, I'd better finish this,
you go and have fun.

10
00:01:49,175 --> 00:01:51,075
All right, suit yourself.

11
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:53,342
Let's go, girls.

12
00:01:53,347 --> 00:01:56,540
- Wait for me! - I'm ready - Do I look okay?
- Look, it's Howl's castle!

13
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:57,982
- Wha'? - Where? - Howl? - Where?

14
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,109
I've never seen it so close!

15
00:02:00,137 --> 00:02:02,054
You think he can see us?

16
00:02:02,088 --> 00:02:04,256
You think Howl is going to town?

17
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:12,361
He's gone...

18
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,162
No, he's just hiding in 
the fog from those plains.

19
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:17,862
Did you hear what happened to that 
girl, Martha, from South Haven?

20
00:02:18,005 --> 00:02:20,405
They say Howl tore her heart out.

21
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,337
- Now I'm too scared to go out...
- What?

22
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:24,966
Don't worry, he only 
preys on pretty girls.

23
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:28,073
All right, let's go.

24
00:02:28,116 --> 00:02:29,381
You guys are mean...

25
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,102
Hey, looks like a little
mouse lost its way.

26
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:39,273
Oh, no... I'm not lost.

27
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:41,414
This little mouse looks thirsty,

28
00:04:41,578 --> 00:04:43,174
We should take her for a cup of tea.

29
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:44,878
No thanks, My sister's expecting me.

30
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:47,680
She's pretty cute for a mouse.

31
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,050
How old are you, anyway?
You live around here?

32
00:04:50,523 --> 00:04:51,917
Leave me alone!

33
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:55,094
You see? Your moustache
scares all the girls.

34
00:04:55,195 --> 00:04:57,730
So? I think she's even
cuter when she's scared.

35
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
There you are sweetheart,
sorry I'm late.

36
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,794
I was looking everywhere for you.

37
00:05:01,838 --> 00:05:03,164
Hey, hey, we're busy here.

38
00:05:03,203 --> 00:05:04,270
Are you really?

39
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:07,737
It looked to me, like the two
of you were just leaving.

40
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,000
- Can't... - Stop... - Stop.

41
00:05:15,281 --> 00:05:16,714
Don't hold it against them.

42
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:18,750
They're actually not all that bad.

43
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:22,383
Where to? I'll be your 
escort this evening.

44
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:24,987
Oh, I’m, uhm, just going to the bakery.

45
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:27,653
Don't get alarmed,
but I'm being followed.

46
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:28,988
Act normal.

47
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:52,143
Sorry, looks like you're involved.

48
00:05:56,322 --> 00:05:57,084
This way.

49
00:06:04,997 --> 00:06:05,656
Hold on.

50
00:06:10,738 --> 00:06:14,172
Now... straighten your legs
and start walking.

51
00:06:19,012 --> 00:06:21,874
See? Not so hard, is it?

52
00:06:37,297 --> 00:06:38,859
You are a natural.

53
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:55,311
I'll make sure to draw them off.

54
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,511
But wait a bit before
you head back outside.

55
00:06:58,117 --> 00:06:59,084
'Kay.

56
00:06:59,952 --> 00:07:01,249
That's my girl.

57
00:07:13,066 --> 00:07:13,950
There you go.

58
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:15,226
Do you have any Lettie shaped cookies?

59
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:16,858
I'd buy some of those.

60
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:17,467
Here.

61
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:19,062
What time do you get off?

62
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:20,172
She was?

63
00:07:21,874 --> 00:07:23,599
Hey, I'm over here, where're you going?

64
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,504
Sophie!

65
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,550
Lettie.

66
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:34,007
What's going on? Someone just told me 
that you floated down onto our balcony.

67
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:36,712
So that did happen,
it wasn't a dream...

68
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:39,017
Lettie, would you like 
to use my office?

69
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:40,959
I should really get back to work.

70
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:42,359
Thank you though.

71
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:47,321
Wow! He must have been a wizard then.

72
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,396
But he was so kind to me...

73
00:07:50,153 --> 00:07:52,196
He rescued me, Lettie...

74
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:55,268
Of course he did, he was 
trying to steal your heart.

75
00:07:55,758 --> 00:07:57,500
You were so lucky, Sophie.

76
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:59,967
If that wizard were Howl,
he would've eaten it.

77
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,979
No, he wouldn't, Howl only does 
that to beautiful girls.

78
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:05,816
Don't give me that.

79
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:09,149
You need to be more careful,
it's dangerous out there.

80
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:12,189
Even the Witch of the Waste 
is back on the prowl.

81
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:15,004
Are you listening?

82
00:08:15,334 --> 00:08:15,984
Huh?

83
00:08:16,546 --> 00:08:17,993
Argh...

84
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:22,726
Lettie, the chocolate 
éclairs are done.

85
00:08:23,402 --> 00:08:24,994
Okay, I'll be right there.

86
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:26,399
Thanks.

87
00:08:27,897 --> 00:08:29,497
All right, I'd better get going then.

88
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:32,137
I just wanted to make sure 
that you were doing okay.

89
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:35,179
Hello, Lettie

90
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:36,474
Hi, how are you doing?

91
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:40,444
Now, Sophie, do you really want to spend 
the rest of you life in that hat shop?

92
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:45,282
The shop was just so important to father 
and I'm the eldest, I don't mind.

93
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:49,686
I'm not asking what father would've 
wanted, I want to know what you want.

94
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,185
Well...

95
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:52,358
See you later, Lettie.

96
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:53,829
Good seeing you again.

97
00:08:53,966 --> 00:08:54,664
You too.

98
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,025
I'd better be going.

99
00:08:56,169 --> 00:08:59,169
It's your life, Sophie, do something
for yourself for once, will you?

100
00:08:59,200 --> 00:08:59,969
Bye Lettie.

101
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:10,235
I'm sorry, but the shop's
closed now, ma'am.

102
00:10:10,376 --> 00:10:13,067
I could have sworn I locked 
that door, must've forgotten.

103
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:20,080
What a tacky shop. 
I've never seen such tacky, little hats.

104
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,213
Yet, you're by far the 
tackiest thing here.

105
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:28,159
I'm afraid you will have to leave now.

106
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:36,433
The door's over here, ma'am, we're closed.

107
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:40,972
Standing up to Witch of the Waste,
that's plucky.

108
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,066
The Witch of the Waste?

109
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:53,814
The best part of that spell, is 
you can't tell anyone about it.

110
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:56,019
My regards to Howl.

111
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,727
Tha-that's really me, isn't it?

112
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:46,798
I've got to stay calm.

113
00:12:03,956 --> 00:12:05,548
I've got to stay calm.

114
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,558
Now, there's no use panicking, Sophie.

115
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:12,729
It's a bad dream, that's all, 
just go inside, go to bed.

116
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:18,165
You're gonna be fine, Sophie.
You're gonna be fine.

117
00:12:18,365 --> 00:12:20,065
I've got to stay calm.

118
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:31,509
Look who's here!

119
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:33,246
- You're back!
- Welcome home, Ma'am!

120
00:12:33,285 --> 00:12:35,200
- Look at you!
- What do you think?

121
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:37,982
- It's all the rage in Kingsbury.
- It's beautiful.

122
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:41,184
- It's gorgeous.
- I know. Our customers will love it.

123
00:12:41,254 --> 00:12:42,392
Sophie!

124
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,892
Sophie?

125
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:47,192
I'm afraid your daughter hasn't 
come downstairs yet today, ma'am.

126
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:49,198
That's strange, I wonder what's wrong.

127
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,197
Sophie?

128
00:12:55,197 --> 00:12:56,200
Sophie?

129
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,800
Sophie!

130
00:13:00,012 --> 00:13:01,809
Don't come in here.

131
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:04,100
I've got a bad cold.

132
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:06,045
I don't want you to catch it.

133
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:08,487
You sound ghastly...

134
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,855
Like some 90 year-old woman.

135
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:13,720
I'll stay in bed all day,
so you go on.

136
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:16,855
Well... If you insist.

137
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:20,831
Up we go...

138
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:33,608
This isn't so bad, now is it?

139
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:38,076
You're still in good shape, and your 
clothes finally suit you.

140
00:13:40,253 --> 00:13:42,919
But you can't stay here 
like this for long.

141
00:13:53,532 --> 00:13:54,624
Ouh, ouh.

142
00:13:54,794 --> 00:13:57,826
Being old is worse than I thought.

143
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,000
- They say their prince is missing.
- And they're blaming us.

144
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,100
Unbelievable

145
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,400
Yeah, yeah, it sounds like they're 
gonna start a war. 

146
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,300
That's what I heard.

147
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,500
That's terrible, nobody 
needs to be at war.

148
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,500
Let's hope the prince
turns up soon.

149
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:24,487
Excuse me, could you use some help?

150
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:28,526
I'll be fine, but thanks for offering.
That was really kind.

151
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:32,268
Sure, there's room in the back if you'd
like, but where are you headed?

152
00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:34,964
Just a little way's farther than 
where you're going.

153
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,703
You're crazy if you do this, grandma!

154
00:14:41,847 --> 00:14:44,441
There's nothing but witches 
and wizards out there.

155
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,914
Thank you, I'll keep that in mind.

156
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:49,183
She's going to the Waste by herself?

157
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:51,389
Says she's looking for her younger sister.

158
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:09,034
I'll never get there with these legs...

159
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:13,407
At least my teeth haven't worn out yet.

160
00:15:21,187 --> 00:15:23,612
That would make a nice cane.

161
00:15:23,822 --> 00:15:25,722
Up we go.

162
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:34,295
Might be too big.

163
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,843
This is one stubborn branch.

164
00:15:48,848 --> 00:15:51,480
You're not getting the best 
of this old lady.

165
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:08,560
Just a scarecrow! I was afraid you 
were one of those blob men.

166
00:16:08,934 --> 00:16:11,903
But how are you standing on
your own, like that?

167
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:16,197
Your head's a turnip.

168
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:20,042
I've always hated turnips,
ever since I was little.

169
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:22,737
At least you're not
upside down now.

170
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:24,475
So long.

171
00:16:31,424 --> 00:16:33,353
It's too cold.

172
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,755
And I can still se the town,
I've barely moved.

173
00:16:41,701 --> 00:16:46,663
Go away, quit following me, there's no
need to thank me, you don't owe me a thing.

174
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:49,230
I'm sure you have some 
kind of spell on you,

175
00:16:49,374 --> 00:16:52,007
and I've had more than enough 
of witches and spells!

176
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:55,409
So just go find some field 
and stand in it!

177
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:19,503
Thank you, this cane is perfect,
it's just what I need.

178
00:17:19,639 --> 00:17:24,805
If you'd like to do me one more favour, you 
could run off and find me a place to stay.

179
00:17:35,021 --> 00:17:38,151
I seem to become quite 
cunning in my old age.

180
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,899
A battleship.

181
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:55,536
Why do you get so cold,
when you're old?

182
00:17:55,736 --> 00:17:59,436
I'm fatter than ever, yet the 
wind blows right through me.

183
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:18,458
Someone's got a fire going,
maybe there's a cabin nearby.

184
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:40,846
You turnip-head, that's Howl's castle.

185
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:45,017
That is not what I meant when 
I asked for a place to stay!

186
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:57,025
Look at that.

187
00:18:57,069 --> 00:18:59,036
They call this a castle?

188
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:21,317
Is that the way in?

189
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:25,162
Slow down.

190
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:28,999
For heavens sake!

191
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:33,232
Make up your mind, are you gonna 
let me in, or not?!

192
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:39,372
Oh, my shawl!

193
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:54,854
It's nice and warm in there, 
so I'm going in.

194
00:19:55,095 --> 00:19:57,121
Oh, my shawl, thank you.

195
00:19:57,263 --> 00:20:01,499
I'm sure Howl won't eat the heart of a 
shrivelled, old lady, like me.

196
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:05,998
It's been a pleasure meeting you.

197
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:09,005
Even if you are my least 
favourite vegetable.

198
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:11,109
Take care, Turnip-head.

199
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:02,627
What a dump... When I think "Castle",
this is not what I picture.

200
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:15,866
Well, one nice thing about getting old 
is nothing frightens you.

201
00:21:25,484 --> 00:21:28,179
I don't envy you lady,
that is one bad curse.

202
00:21:28,554 --> 00:21:31,655
Curses are tough, you're gonna have a 
very hard time getting rid of that one.

203
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,690
The fire spoke.

204
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:37,294
Let me guess, the curse won't allow
you to talk about it, right?

205
00:21:37,696 --> 00:21:39,088
Are you Howl?

206
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:42,659
No, I'm an extremely powerful 
fire demon named Calcifer!

207
00:21:42,859 --> 00:21:44,159
I just like to do that once in a while.

208
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:48,703
A fire demon? Well then, you should 
be able to break my curse.

209
00:21:49,174 --> 00:21:50,098
Maybe, maybe not.

210
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,833
Listen, if you can find a way to 
break the spell that's on me.

211
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:55,703
Then I'll break the spell that's on you.
You got it?

212
00:21:56,348 --> 00:21:59,244
If you're a demon, how do I 
know I can trust you?

213
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:01,416
You promise to help me, if I help you?

214
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:04,485
I don't know lady, demons don't make promises.

215
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:07,583
Then go find someone else.

216
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,753
Come one, you should feel sorry for me.

217
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:13,587
That spell keeps me stuck in this castle 
and Howl treats me like I'm his slave.

218
00:22:13,765 --> 00:22:16,734
It burns me up. You gotta keep the water
hot, the rooms warm...

219
00:22:16,902 --> 00:22:18,929
- ...keep the castle moving. Come on!
- Uh, that's rough.

220
00:22:18,949 --> 00:22:20,739
You ever tried to move a castle?

221
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:25,000
If you figure out how to break this thing
I'm in with Howl, then you can break my spell.

222
00:22:25,143 --> 00:22:27,976
After that, I can easily break 
the spell that's on you.

223
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:32,514
All right.
It's a deal.

224
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,400
Hey. Lady? Lady!

225
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:39,020
Hello! Lady!

226
00:22:39,058 --> 00:22:40,389
Hello! Hey, hey, hey.

227
00:22:40,489 --> 00:22:42,389
Lady! Lady!

228
00:22:42,489 --> 00:22:44,389
Hey, let me get over there...

229
00:22:45,397 --> 00:22:47,422
Some big help you're gonna be...

230
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,278
Hey, who's this lady?

231
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:45,014
Porthaven door!

232
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:46,884
How'd she get in here?

233
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:55,860
Stand by.

234
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:01,799
Mister mayor, good day.

235
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:05,899
Good afternoon, sir, would the great 
wizard, Jenkins, be at home?

236
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:08,243
I'm afraid that my master
is out at the moment.

237
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,908
I speak for him in his absence.

238
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:14,313
An invitation from His Majesty, the King.

239
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:15,750
The time for war's upon us.

240
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:20,212
His Majesty requires that every witch 
and wizard aid our homeland.

241
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:25,092
Wizard Jenkins must report to the 
palace immediately. That is all.

242
00:24:27,266 --> 00:24:30,005
I can't believe it's come to this.

243
00:24:30,268 --> 00:24:32,259
And what do you think you're 
doing here, grandma?

244
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:34,600
Calcifer said that I could come in.

245
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:38,004
I did not, she just wandered in 
here from the Wastes.

246
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:39,602
She's from the Wastes?

247
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,909
How do we know that she's not a witch?

248
00:24:43,382 --> 00:24:45,409
Do you really think I'd let a witch in here?

249
00:24:46,384 --> 00:24:48,249
Porthaven door again.

250
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:50,519
Must be a customer.

251
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:54,083
Stand by.

252
00:24:56,895 --> 00:24:58,087
Yes, my dear child?

253
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,591
My mom sent me to pick up a spell.

254
00:25:00,732 --> 00:25:03,428
- Ah yes, do come in.
- Okay.

255
00:25:04,569 --> 00:25:06,896
Just keep quiet and does cause 
any trouble, grandma.

256
00:25:23,889 --> 00:25:25,288
It's not the Wastes.

257
00:25:25,423 --> 00:25:28,256
Excuse me, granny, are you a witch, too?

258
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:33,058
That's right,
I'm the scariest witch of them all.

259
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:36,033
Dust your ship with this powder 
and the winds will favour it.

260
00:25:36,168 --> 00:25:37,394
Thanks.

261
00:25:39,738 --> 00:25:41,330
Farewell, child.

262
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,339
Quit telling lies to our customers.

263
00:25:45,477 --> 00:25:47,642
What about you?
You're wearing a disguise.

264
00:25:47,779 --> 00:25:50,680
I have to. 
I'm practicing my magic.

265
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:54,247
It's the Kingsbury door.

266
00:25:55,954 --> 00:25:56,943
Stand by.

267
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:05,190
Good day, would this be the residence of 
the great wizard, Pendragon?

268
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:06,422
It is.

269
00:26:06,465 --> 00:26:09,228
I bear an invitation
from His Majesty, the King.

270
00:26:09,368 --> 00:26:14,328
Please inform Mister Pendragon, that all witches and 
wizards are required to report for duty at the palace.

271
00:26:14,973 --> 00:26:17,200
I will inform him right away.

272
00:26:31,523 --> 00:26:34,351
This is the royal city, isn't it?

273
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:37,289
Move it grandma, or you'll lose your nose.

274
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,698
And stop wandering around.

275
00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:23,833
Leave it alone grandma,
I'm getting angry.

276
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:26,868
This is a magic house, isn't it?

277
00:27:27,012 --> 00:27:27,410
Orh!

278
00:27:27,546 --> 00:27:29,905
So tell me, where does the black one lead?

279
00:27:30,048 --> 00:27:31,613
Only Master Howl knows that.

280
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:34,614
I need some breakfast, I'm starved.

281
00:27:44,228 --> 00:27:46,560
Don't you want to have some bacon and eggs?

282
00:27:47,198 --> 00:27:50,326
Yeah, but we can't use the fire.
Master Howl's not here.

283
00:27:53,872 --> 00:27:55,772
Don't worry, I can cook.

284
00:27:56,274 --> 00:27:57,441
It doesn't matter if you can cook.

285
00:27:57,975 --> 00:28:00,408
Calcifer only obeys Master Howl.

286
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:03,540
That's right lady, 
I'm not taking any orders from you.

287
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:05,515
Oh, there's my hat.

288
00:28:07,915 --> 00:28:09,000
That's better.

289
00:28:09,788 --> 00:28:12,655
All right, Calcifer,
let's get cooking.

290
00:28:12,657 --> 00:28:16,821
I don't cook!
I'm a scary and powerful fire demon.

291
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:21,257
How would you like a bucket 
of cold water in your face?

292
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:24,635
Or maybe I should tell Howl about our bargain?

293
00:28:25,137 --> 00:28:29,873
Uh! Stupid me, I NEVER should have let her in here!

294
00:28:30,008 --> 00:28:31,976
So, what'll it be?

295
00:28:35,346 --> 00:28:38,440
That's right, that's a good fire.

296
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:43,347
Here's another curse:
May all your bacon burn.

297
00:28:43,755 --> 00:28:45,782
Calcifer is doing what she says...

298
00:28:45,824 --> 00:28:48,720
I think I'd like some tea, too.
Do you have a kettle?

299
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:49,420
Sure.

300
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:52,320
Hey, hey, hey, what are you doing? 
Don't get the kettle.

301
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:53,820
Whose side are you on anyway?

302
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,820
- Ma-Markl? Markl? What are you doing?
- Huh?

303
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:01,529
Master Howl, the Kings messengers were here.

304
00:29:01,706 --> 00:29:03,565
They said you have to report to the palace.

305
00:29:03,708 --> 00:29:06,404
As both Pendragon and Jenkins.

306
00:29:16,721 --> 00:29:20,013
Calcifer, you're being so obedient.

307
00:29:20,391 --> 00:29:22,218
Not on purpose, she bullied me.

308
00:29:22,361 --> 00:29:25,286
Not just anybody can do that.

309
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:27,263
And you are... who?

310
00:29:27,699 --> 00:29:30,361
Ah, y-you can just call me, Grandma Sophie.

311
00:29:30,502 --> 00:29:33,566
I'm your new cleaning lady,
I just started work today.

312
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:34,932
Give that to me.

313
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:42,371
Hand me two more slices of that bacon 
and six more of those eggs

314
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,592
Yummy.

315
00:30:12,944 --> 00:30:15,037
So then... who hired you to clean?

316
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:19,916
Calcifer did.
He's disgusted by how dirty it is in here.

317
00:30:20,385 --> 00:30:21,647
Hmm.

318
00:30:21,853 --> 00:30:23,684
Markl, get the plates.

319
00:30:26,525 --> 00:30:29,657
Wait a second, you're all gonna 
eat while I do all the work?

320
00:30:29,894 --> 00:30:31,521
Come have some breakfast, Sophie.

321
00:30:37,068 --> 00:30:38,060
Take a seat.

322
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:54,485
Which do you want?

323
00:30:54,986 --> 00:30:56,977
You only get one, 'cause the rest are dirty.

324
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:01,983
Looks like I've got my work cut out for me.

325
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:05,260
Bread, Markl?

326
00:31:05,396 --> 00:31:06,385
Thanks.

327
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:08,790
Sophie?

328
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:10,599
Yes, thank you.

329
00:31:11,936 --> 00:31:14,627
So friends, enjoy, bon appétit

330
00:31:14,772 --> 00:31:15,761
Bon appétit

331
00:31:15,907 --> 00:31:18,375
I can't remember the last
time we had a real breakfast.

332
00:31:24,983 --> 00:31:28,050
Even the manners are a mess in this house...

333
00:31:28,853 --> 00:31:31,883
So, what do you have hidden in you pocket, Sophie?

334
00:31:32,391 --> 00:31:33,090
Huh?

335
00:31:43,601 --> 00:31:44,600
What is this?

336
00:31:44,702 --> 00:31:46,201
Give it to me.

337
00:31:53,176 --> 00:31:55,143
Scorch marks. Howl, can you read them?

338
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,538
That is ancient sorcery.

339
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:59,047
And quite powerful, too.

340
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:01,000
It's from the Witch of the Waste?

341
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:05,451
"You who swallowed a falling star,
oh heartless man"

342
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,950
"Your heart shall soon belong to me."

343
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,625
That can't be good for the table.

344
00:32:23,574 --> 00:32:25,303
Wow, it's gone!

345
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:28,011
The mark may be gone,
but the spell is still there.

346
00:32:28,479 --> 00:32:31,107
Excuse me, my friends, please continue your meal.

347
00:32:32,383 --> 00:32:35,409
Calcifer, move the castle
60 miles to the west.

348
00:32:40,725 --> 00:32:43,116
And while you're at it, make hot water for my bath.

349
00:32:43,261 --> 00:32:45,853
Fine, like moving the castle wasn't hard enough.

350
00:32:46,564 --> 00:32:49,089
You're not working for the
Witch of the Waste, are you?

351
00:32:50,368 --> 00:32:54,395
I would never work for that witch,
she's the one who...

352
00:32:58,309 --> 00:32:59,336
Actually...

353
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:08,944
If I ever get my hands on that witch,
I'm gonna wring her fat neck!

354
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:11,112
Finish your breakfast!

355
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:16,786
I've had enough of this.

356
00:33:18,386 --> 00:33:20,786
You bugs better run,
before I bite your heads off.

357
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:25,326
I'm sick of being treated like 
some timid, little, old lady.

358
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:32,273
Hello sir, is my potion ready?

359
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:33,502
Come back later.

360
00:33:33,944 --> 00:33:35,937
There's a witch on the rampage in there.

361
00:33:42,787 --> 00:33:43,786
Sophie, please.

362
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,818
Sophie, please help me, I'm going out.

363
00:33:49,494 --> 00:33:52,058
Please, get me some firewood quick.
Quick, come on.

364
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:54,528
Hey, please help me.

365
00:33:54,666 --> 00:33:58,809
Hey, wh-what are you doing? No, don't, don't, 
I'll fall! You crazy lady with tongs!

366
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,431
- You'll be fine.
- I'll fall, help!

367
00:34:00,571 --> 00:34:01,860
I'm just sweeping out the ashes.

368
00:34:01,906 --> 00:34:03,606
No, I'm not fine.

369
00:34:04,041 --> 00:34:06,436
Please, I'm... I'm going out.

370
00:34:06,508 --> 00:34:07,538
Please...

371
00:34:09,979 --> 00:34:11,539
Please... I'm falling...

372
00:34:13,117 --> 00:34:15,509
Help! Fall, I'm falling.

373
00:34:19,059 --> 00:34:22,852
Sophie, hurry up, please. Hurry, please.

374
00:34:45,884 --> 00:34:49,053
I'd appreciate it, if you didn't torment my friend.

375
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:56,590
Master Howl, are you going out now?

376
00:34:58,996 --> 00:35:03,558
Markl, make sure the cleaning lady
doesn't get carried away while I'm gone.

377
00:35:08,406 --> 00:35:10,237
Sophie, what did you do now?

378
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:12,633
She almost smothered me.

379
00:35:13,044 --> 00:35:16,042
If I die, Howl dies too, I hope you know.

380
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:18,447
Argh, be quiet, you're alright.

381
00:35:18,582 --> 00:35:21,212
Now quit bothering me, I've got a job to do.

382
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:24,346
Wait, you can't come up here!

383
00:35:24,589 --> 00:35:27,558
Whatever you don't want me to clean,
better hide it now.

384
00:35:28,759 --> 00:35:30,590
Save my room for last, okay?

385
00:35:33,931 --> 00:35:36,928
These little outbursts seem to be 
giving me some energy.

386
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:42,002
What a mess!

387
00:36:19,243 --> 00:36:20,933
Incredible!

388
00:36:21,078 --> 00:36:23,308
Calcifer, Calcifer!

389
00:36:23,447 --> 00:36:25,640
Are you the one moving the castle?

390
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:28,004
Of course I am, no one else 
does any work around here.

391
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:29,809
I am thoroughly impressed.

392
00:36:30,088 --> 00:36:33,348
You're a first class fire demon,
I like your spark.

393
00:36:35,793 --> 00:36:39,687
She likes my spark!

394
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:47,795
Hah, not ready, not ready!

395
00:37:20,438 --> 00:37:24,099
- It's beautiful.
- Yeah, it's called Star Lake.

396
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:31,045
Hey, what's that stick doing in there?

397
00:37:31,182 --> 00:37:33,948
Oh, dear.
Give me a hand, Markl.

398
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,550
It's a scarecrow.

399
00:37:43,694 --> 00:37:45,828
Yep, I've been calling him Turnip-head.

400
00:37:45,963 --> 00:37:48,896
Somehow, he always manages 
to get stuck upside down.

401
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:59,806
He keeps following me everywhere.

402
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:02,044
Seems to have taken a liking to me.

403
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:04,610
That's weird.
Are you sure you're not a witch, Sophie?

404
00:38:04,749 --> 00:38:08,378
Oh yes, I'm the worst kind of witch ever;
the kind that cleans.

405
00:38:37,348 --> 00:38:40,481
Quit pulling so hard, Turnip-head. 

406
00:38:49,927 --> 00:38:51,952
I think he likes doing the laundry.

407
00:38:52,096 --> 00:38:54,360
Looks like he'll have it dry in no time.

408
00:38:57,034 --> 00:38:59,166
I bet he's some kind of demon.

409
00:38:59,303 --> 00:39:00,964
Calcifer doesn't seem to mind him at all.

410
00:39:01,305 --> 00:39:04,274
You're right, he probably is a demon.

411
00:39:05,476 --> 00:39:09,037
But he led me here,
so maybe he's the good kind.

412
00:39:51,122 --> 00:39:53,186
We got all the laundry put away, Sophie.

413
00:39:53,292 --> 00:39:58,893
Oh, thank you, Markl. When you're old, 
all you want to do is stare at the scenery.

414
00:39:59,462 --> 00:40:01,027
It's so strange.

415
00:40:01,164 --> 00:40:03,465
I've never felt so peaceful before.

416
00:41:23,281 --> 00:41:26,209
You okay? I mean, you smell terrible.

417
00:41:43,503 --> 00:41:48,963
You shouldn't keep flying around like that.
Soon, you won't be able to turn back into a human.

418
00:41:53,211 --> 00:41:56,271
Isn't this great? Sophie put these here for me.

419
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:00,747
This war is terrible.

420
00:42:00,885 --> 00:42:04,848
They've bombed from the southern coast to 
the northern border. It's only flames now. 

421
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:07,652
I can’t stand the fire in gunpowder.

422
00:42:07,791 --> 00:42:10,453
Those dopy guys have absolutely no manners.

423
00:42:11,329 --> 00:42:13,062
My own kind attacked me today.

424
00:42:13,097 --> 00:42:14,330
Who? The Witch of the Waste?

425
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:18,301
No, some hack wizards, who turned themselves 
into monsters for the king.

426
00:42:18,802 --> 00:42:21,571
Those wizards are going to regret doing that.

427
00:42:21,706 --> 00:42:24,033
They'll never change back into humans.

428
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:27,103
After the war, they won't recall they ever were human.

429
00:42:27,245 --> 00:42:30,373
Hey, aren't you supposed to report 
to the king too?

430
00:42:30,414 --> 00:42:31,711
I'm tired.

431
00:42:31,849 --> 00:42:33,573
Make some hot water for my bath.

432
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:35,514
What? Not again.

433
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:12,184
- Is Howl back?
- Yes, he's wasting all my hot water again.

434
00:43:17,128 --> 00:43:20,422
I don't know why we're doing this.
Master Howl hardly eats anything.

435
00:43:20,564 --> 00:43:21,553
Too bad.

436
00:43:21,699 --> 00:43:23,257
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

437
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:30,237
Don't you love early morning markets?
And just look at the water.

438
00:43:30,308 --> 00:43:33,839
I've never seen the ocean before. It's beautiful.

439
00:43:33,977 --> 00:43:35,168
It always looks like that.

440
00:43:44,821 --> 00:43:46,386
I hate potatoes.

441
00:43:46,523 --> 00:43:47,415
Pay up.

442
00:43:47,558 --> 00:43:49,123
Thanks, have a nice day.

443
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:50,358
Thank you, come again.

444
00:43:52,062 --> 00:43:54,330
All our fish were caught fresh this morning.

445
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,434
I hate fish.

446
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:00,095
One of our ships is in the harbour!

447
00:44:00,138 --> 00:44:01,705
It looks like it's on fire!

448
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:04,036
Looks like there's been a serious battle.

449
00:44:04,208 --> 00:44:05,842
What happened? Sorry lady, we're closed.

450
00:44:05,876 --> 00:44:08,168
- It's our flagship!
- The ship, it's sinking.

451
00:44:31,268 --> 00:44:33,202
Come on Sophie, let's get a better look.

452
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:36,363
No, I've seen all I can take.
Let's go home.

453
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:39,768
I can't believe this, that's our most advanced battleship.

454
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:46,676
- The Witch's henchmen are here.
- What?

455
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:48,317
Quiet down!

456
00:44:48,452 --> 00:44:50,745
They're only a few feet away.

457
00:44:56,494 --> 00:44:57,320
He's gone.

458
00:44:57,461 --> 00:45:00,259
I don't understand why no one else seem to notice him.

459
00:45:06,103 --> 00:45:07,866
Look! There they are!

460
00:45:08,172 --> 00:45:12,141
- That plane! That's what dropped the bombs!
- Look up there, Sophie, it's the enemy's airship.

461
00:45:17,848 --> 00:45:19,713
Sophie, wait up! Sophie!

462
00:45:20,084 --> 00:45:23,053
Ignore the flyers,
they're enemy propaganda!

463
00:45:27,925 --> 00:45:29,326
Sophie, are you okay?

464
00:45:35,666 --> 00:45:37,595
I just need a glass of water.

465
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:38,759
I'll get it.

466
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:57,416
Sophie, you... you sabotaged me! Look!

467
00:45:57,822 --> 00:46:00,487
Look what you've done to my hair! Look!

468
00:46:01,124 --> 00:46:02,455
What a pretty colour.

469
00:46:02,793 --> 00:46:03,851
It's hideous!

470
00:46:04,161 --> 00:46:07,255
You completely ruined my magic potions in the bathroom.

471
00:46:08,399 --> 00:46:11,033
I just organized things, Howl,
nothing's ruined.

472
00:46:11,468 --> 00:46:12,992
Wrong! Wrong!

473
00:46:13,137 --> 00:46:16,532
I specifically ordered you not to get carried away.

474
00:46:16,907 --> 00:46:18,572
Now I'm repulsive...

475
00:46:18,909 --> 00:46:21,603
I can't live like this...

476
00:46:23,047 --> 00:46:25,271
Come on, it's not that bad.

477
00:46:33,323 --> 00:46:36,151
You should look at it now, this shade is even better.

478
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:41,261
I give up...
I seek no point in living, if I can't be beautiful...

479
00:46:52,776 --> 00:46:57,544
- Howl! Cut it out! Howl, no, stop it! Howl!
- He's calling the Spirits of Darkness.

480
00:46:57,681 --> 00:47:00,907
I saw him do this once before, when a girl dumped him.

481
00:47:04,254 --> 00:47:06,313
Now Howl, you're all right.

482
00:47:06,557 --> 00:47:10,254
We'll just dye your hair back again. Okay?

483
00:47:20,604 --> 00:47:22,764
Fine! So, you think you've got it bad?

484
00:47:22,907 --> 00:47:26,276
I've never once been beautiful in my entire life!

485
00:47:27,778 --> 00:47:29,841
I've had enough of this place!

486
00:48:09,319 --> 00:48:12,755
Thank you, Turnip-head.
How did you get to be so kind?

487
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:15,991
Sophie, get back inside, we need your help.
Howl's in trouble!

488
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:19,400
Howl, cut it out, cut it out, I'm gonna drown,
I'm drowning here Howl!

489
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:21,991
Sophie! Sophie, help him, please.

490
00:48:22,133 --> 00:48:24,130
Sophie, do something!

491
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:27,663
Such drama.

492
00:48:28,005 --> 00:48:28,999
Is he dead?

493
00:48:29,139 --> 00:48:33,670
No, he's fine, he's just throwing a tantrum.
Come on, give me a hand.

494
00:48:34,270 --> 00:48:35,170
Okay.

495
00:48:38,348 --> 00:48:40,778
- Get the hot water running.
- Right!

496
00:48:41,218 --> 00:48:43,914
Come on, Howl, you can still walk.

497
00:48:55,332 --> 00:48:56,766
Get him cleaned up, Markl.

498
00:48:56,901 --> 00:48:58,493
I will.

499
00:49:00,003 --> 00:49:02,062
Now I have to mop again.

500
00:49:11,062 --> 00:49:13,362
This says they've landed on the coast already.

501
00:49:13,962 --> 00:49:14,862
- Where?
- North.

502
00:49:25,262 --> 00:49:26,854
Howl, I'm coming in.

503
00:49:35,005 --> 00:49:37,838
I've brought you some warm milk.
Want a sip?

504
00:49:40,844 --> 00:49:44,810
I'll leave it here for you then.
Try to drink it, before it gets cold.

505
00:49:48,518 --> 00:49:50,315
Sophie, wait...

506
00:49:58,362 --> 00:49:59,989
Do you want some milk?

507
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:13,173
The Witch of the Waste
is trying to find my castle.

508
00:50:15,911 --> 00:50:17,947
I saw her henchmen at the harbour.

509
00:50:18,482 --> 00:50:20,773
I'm such a big coward, all I do is hide.

510
00:50:20,818 --> 00:50:24,679
And all of this magic is just to keep everybody away.

511
00:50:24,822 --> 00:50:26,683
I can't stand how scared I am.

512
00:50:28,392 --> 00:50:31,691
Howl, why is the Witch of the Waste 
trying to hunt you down?

513
00:50:32,496 --> 00:50:36,292
She was once quite beautiful,
so I decided to pursue her.

514
00:50:36,433 --> 00:50:40,191
Then I realized she wasn't,
so as usual, I ran away.

515
00:50:42,973 --> 00:50:46,101
I can't run much longer though,
I have to report to the palace.

516
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:48,634
As both Pendragon and Jenkins...

517
00:50:48,779 --> 00:50:51,213
How many aliases do you have, anyway?

518
00:50:51,448 --> 00:50:53,948
As many as I need to keep my freedom.

519
00:50:55,419 --> 00:50:57,751
Just refuse the King's invitation.

520
00:50:57,788 --> 00:50:59,048
See that?

521
00:50:59,356 --> 00:51:02,383
That's the oath I took, 
when I entered the Royal Sorcery Academy.

522
00:51:02,483 --> 00:51:05,183
I must report to the palace whenever summoned.

523
00:51:06,096 --> 00:51:08,856
You know, Howl?
I think that you should see the King.

524
00:51:09,032 --> 00:51:10,363
What?

525
00:51:11,101 --> 00:51:12,391
Give him a piece of your mind.

526
00:51:12,436 --> 00:51:16,536
Tell him this war is pointless
and you refuse too take part, huh?

527
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:21,410
You obviously don't know 
what these people are like.

528
00:51:21,979 --> 00:51:27,048
But he's our king. He should want to hear 
what all his citizens have to say.

529
00:51:28,217 --> 00:51:28,911
I got it!

530
00:51:29,352 --> 00:51:31,313
Why don't you go to the palace for me?

531
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:35,616
Just say that you're Pendragon's mother.

532
00:51:35,693 --> 00:51:39,358
And your son is such a cowardly wizard,
he's too afraid to show his face.

533
00:51:39,463 --> 00:51:42,363
Maybe then, Madam Suliman 
will finally give up on me.

534
00:51:42,699 --> 00:51:44,730
Who's Madam Suliman?

535
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:49,468
You're wearing that hat?

536
00:51:49,507 --> 00:51:51,905
After all the magic I used
to make your dress pretty...

537
00:51:52,042 --> 00:51:53,509
Take care of him, Markl!

538
00:51:55,578 --> 00:51:56,543
Good luck!

539
00:52:04,822 --> 00:52:07,790
This charm will guarantee you your safe return.

540
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:12,560
Don't worry, I'll follow behind you in disguise.

541
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:14,263
Now, off you go!

542
00:52:22,105 --> 00:52:25,067
Why do I feel like this is not going to work?

543
00:52:33,684 --> 00:52:37,251
I wonder what Howl disguised himself as,
surely not a crow!

544
00:52:44,027 --> 00:52:46,457
Can't be a pigeon, 
he's too flamboyant for that.

545
00:52:52,936 --> 00:52:54,096
That could be him...

546
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:08,478
Look how far I still have to go...

547
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:53,354
Howl?
You disguised yourself as an old dog?

548
00:53:58,667 --> 00:54:02,134
You couldn't think of something a bit more useful?

549
00:54:02,272 --> 00:54:04,536
Do you know how hard it is to do things, 
when you're old?

550
00:54:07,777 --> 00:54:11,105
Look who's here, 
the tacky, little girl from the hat shop.

551
00:54:11,314 --> 00:54:12,906
The Witch of the Waste!

552
00:54:13,049 --> 00:54:16,041
Thank you for handing my 
scorching love note to Howl.

553
00:54:18,455 --> 00:54:20,389
How's he doing, by the way?

554
00:54:20,690 --> 00:54:22,319
He's acting like a big baby.

555
00:54:22,459 --> 00:54:25,756
And he's working me to the bone as his cleaning lady.

556
00:54:26,463 --> 00:54:27,860
How delightful.

557
00:54:29,466 --> 00:54:33,099
So tell me,
what business do you have here at the palace?

558
00:54:33,236 --> 00:54:36,272
Job hunting.
I'm sick of working for Howl.

559
00:54:36,506 --> 00:54:37,864
And what about yourself?

560
00:54:38,141 --> 00:54:41,135
I received a royal invitation.

561
00:54:41,311 --> 00:54:45,873
That idiot, Suliman,
finally realized how much she needs my powers.

562
00:54:46,249 --> 00:54:49,514
If you're so great, why don't you 
break the spell you put on me?

563
00:54:49,719 --> 00:54:51,177
I'm sorry, dear.

564
00:54:51,321 --> 00:54:55,614
My talent lies in casting spells,
not breaking them.

565
00:54:55,759 --> 00:54:57,193
Bye, granny.

566
00:54:58,595 --> 00:55:02,053
Now, just wait a minute.
You get back here right now!

567
00:55:03,333 --> 00:55:05,927
If I didn’t have you to worry about,
I would have clobbered her.

568
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:25,288
What on earth is wrong with you two?

569
00:55:25,488 --> 00:55:28,824
Sorry Ma'am, vehicles are prohibited
beyond this point.

570
00:55:29,059 --> 00:55:30,617
You must continue on foot.

571
00:55:30,927 --> 00:55:32,060
That Suliman...

572
00:55:32,096 --> 00:55:36,632
Using her magic to force me
to climb all those godforsaken stairs.

573
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:51,101
Come on Howl.
We can do this, just act natural.

574
00:56:15,505 --> 00:56:18,197
Howl, why are you so heavy?

575
00:56:28,151 --> 00:56:32,019
Wait... Help... I can't make it.

576
00:56:32,322 --> 00:56:33,721
What you say?

577
00:56:34,257 --> 00:56:38,421
You suddenly... remembered...
how to break the spell you put on me?

578
00:56:38,161 --> 00:56:40,024
I told you...

579
00:56:40,065 --> 00:56:41,732
I don't know how.

580
00:56:43,299 --> 00:56:45,164
Then start studying!

581
00:56:49,906 --> 00:56:51,999
I don't get it.

582
00:56:52,142 --> 00:56:55,305
Where does she get all that energy?

583
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:04,420
I have to rest a bit.

584
00:57:11,795 --> 00:57:15,861
Why don't you just give up?
You're killing yourself.

585
00:57:16,199 --> 00:57:21,068
I've waited... for 50 years now,
to be invited here...

586
00:57:21,371 --> 00:57:26,206
Ever since that Suliman banished me 
to live in the Wastes.

587
00:57:26,409 --> 00:57:27,938
Well, good luck then.

588
00:57:28,078 --> 00:57:31,441
Too bad I'm not younger,
or I'd lend you a hand.

589
00:57:32,081 --> 00:57:33,605
Come on, Howl.

590
00:57:34,851 --> 00:57:36,819
You cold-hearted, old hag.

591
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:39,581
Next time I'll turn you senile too.

592
00:58:00,543 --> 00:58:02,602
Almost there!

593
00:58:03,446 --> 00:58:05,641
Honoured guest, please follow me.

594
00:58:06,049 --> 00:58:08,575
You should go help her get up these stairs.

595
00:58:08,718 --> 00:58:12,087
I'm strictly forbidden to offer such assistance.

596
00:58:12,255 --> 00:58:15,383
Why, that's so rude,
the King himself invited her.

597
00:58:15,525 --> 00:58:18,091
Come on! Let's go!

598
00:58:19,095 --> 00:58:22,358
Don't give up now!
Are you a witch or aren't you?

599
00:58:24,434 --> 00:58:26,131
Just shut up.

600
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:31,273
What happened?
You look so much older.

601
00:58:32,408 --> 00:58:35,571
Mrs. Pendragon and 
the Witch of the Waste!

602
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:38,338
Pull yourself together.

603
00:58:38,481 --> 00:58:41,147
Isn't this what you've been waiting for?

604
00:58:44,354 --> 00:58:47,687
Mrs. Pendragon and 
the Witch of the Waste!

605
00:58:47,824 --> 00:58:51,420
Your name's Pendragon?
Why does that name sound so familiar?

606
00:58:51,561 --> 00:58:55,622
Uh, because that was the name of my tacky hat shop,
don't you remember?

607
00:58:55,765 --> 00:58:56,823
Is that what it was?

608
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:59,163
Wait in here, please.

609
00:59:05,642 --> 00:59:06,768
A chair!

610
00:59:07,610 --> 00:59:08,737
It's mine!

611
00:59:20,590 --> 00:59:22,615
Howl, get back here.

612
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:32,392
This way please, ma'am.

613
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:12,100
Thank you, madam Suliman.

614
01:00:32,729 --> 01:00:35,088
So, you are Howl's mother, are you?

615
01:00:35,665 --> 01:00:37,890
Yes, I'm Mrs. Pendragon.

616
01:00:38,334 --> 01:00:40,950
You must be tired,
please have a seat.

617
01:00:41,037 --> 01:00:42,229
Thank you.

618
01:00:52,448 --> 01:00:55,884
I am madam Suliman, His Majesty's head sorceress.

619
01:01:01,858 --> 01:01:03,423
That's not your dog, is it?

620
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:05,593
His name is Heen.

621
01:01:05,728 --> 01:01:09,555
He's my errand dog,
I had him escort you here.

622
01:01:13,536 --> 01:01:15,766
I take it Howl won't be joining us?

623
01:01:17,407 --> 01:01:20,042
He's such a lazy son, he sent me instead.

624
01:01:20,176 --> 01:01:23,274
I'm afraid the King would find him completely useless.

625
01:01:24,547 --> 01:01:27,038
I'm very sorry to hear that.

626
01:01:27,216 --> 01:01:30,344
Howl was the last apprentice I ever took on.

627
01:01:31,554 --> 01:01:34,517
I've never seen such a gifted student.

628
01:01:34,757 --> 01:01:39,193
I was thrilled to have finally found someone 
talented enough to replace me.

629
01:01:40,930 --> 01:01:43,829
Then on day, his heart was stolen by a demon,

630
01:01:43,967 --> 01:01:46,094
he never returned to complete his apprenticeship,

631
01:01:46,136 --> 01:01:50,868
and from that day forward, he has been using his magic 
for entirely selfish reasons.

632
01:01:52,909 --> 01:01:54,542
- Mrs. Pendragon.
- Yes?

633
01:01:54,844 --> 01:01:56,678
That boy is extremely dangerous.

634
01:01:56,713 --> 01:02:00,043
His powers are far too great 
for one without a heart.

635
01:02:02,151 --> 01:02:06,483
If he stays selfish, I'm afraid he'll end up 
just like the Witch of the Waste.

636
01:02:06,622 --> 01:02:07,481
Send her in.

637
01:02:13,930 --> 01:02:15,522
What on earth happened to you?

638
01:02:17,467 --> 01:02:20,436
I just restored her to the age she actually is.

639
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:22,465
All her powers are gone now.

640
01:02:22,972 --> 01:02:26,965
Once, she too was a magnificent sorcerer 
with so much promise.

641
01:02:27,310 --> 01:02:33,278
But then she fell prey to a demon of greed,
who slowly consumed her body and soul.

642
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:39,012
Our kingdom can no longer afford to turn a blind eye 
to these disreputable witches and wizards.

643
01:02:39,156 --> 01:02:43,223
If Howl reports to me and vows to use his magic 
to serve the kingdom,

644
01:02:43,359 --> 01:02:46,226
I will show him how to break from his demon.

645
01:02:46,662 --> 01:02:50,496
If not, I'll strip him of all his powers,
just like her.

646
01:02:51,701 --> 01:02:52,690
That is enough!

647
01:02:54,037 --> 01:02:57,729
Now I understand why Howl was so concerned 
about coming to see you.

648
01:02:57,907 --> 01:02:59,040
It's a trap!

649
01:02:59,175 --> 01:03:04,775
You lure people here with an invitation from the King 
and then you strip them of all their powers.

650
01:03:05,315 --> 01:03:07,449
Howl would never be so heartless!

651
01:03:07,583 --> 01:03:11,783
He may be selfish and cowardly
and sometimes he's hard to understand,

652
01:03:11,821 --> 01:03:15,249
but his intentions are good.
He just wants to be free.

653
01:03:15,358 --> 01:03:18,254
Howl won't come here, he doesn't need your help.

654
01:03:18,394 --> 01:03:21,124
He can fix his problem with his demon on his own.

655
01:03:21,264 --> 01:03:23,261
I am certain of it!

656
01:03:23,866 --> 01:03:26,828
Now I understand,
you're in love with Howl.

657
01:03:27,436 --> 01:03:30,428
Howl...
Did you say Howl's coming?

658
01:03:30,506 --> 01:03:33,634
I want his heart, his heart belongs to me.

659
01:03:33,876 --> 01:03:37,771
Stop that, just calm down.
Howl is not coming here, okay?

660
01:03:39,015 --> 01:03:41,006
Oh, I think he will.

661
01:03:41,218 --> 01:03:44,743
I now know his weakness, Mrs. Pendragon.

662
01:03:51,327 --> 01:03:52,251
Your Majesty.

663
01:03:52,295 --> 01:03:53,453
As you were.

664
01:03:54,097 --> 01:03:55,787
So then, how are you feeling?

665
01:03:55,832 --> 01:03:57,094
I'm fine, thank you.

666
01:03:57,233 --> 01:04:00,800
Thought I'd drop by,
rather than sit through a dull war meeting.

667
01:04:01,204 --> 01:04:02,664
What an honour.

668
01:04:02,872 --> 01:04:04,396
Who are your guests?

669
01:04:04,407 --> 01:04:08,007
- This is Howl's mother, Mrs. Pendragon.
- Ah.

670
01:04:12,448 --> 01:04:16,942
Thanks for coming, but I've decided not to use magic 
to win this war.

671
01:04:17,187 --> 01:04:21,947
We have tried using madam Suliman's magic 
to shield our palace from the enemy's bombs,

672
01:04:22,091 --> 01:04:24,616
but the bombs fall on civilian homes instead.

673
01:04:24,711 --> 01:04:27,521
That's the problem with magic.
Right, Suliman?

674
01:04:27,663 --> 01:04:29,990
You're so eloquent today, Your Majesty.

675
01:04:30,066 --> 01:04:31,499
Suliman!

676
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:38,439
I've got a new battle plan!
This time, we're gonna beat them to a pulp!

677
01:04:41,444 --> 01:04:45,574
Suliman, that's the best double you've made of me yet,
keep up the good work!

678
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:46,977
Your Majesty.

679
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:49,513
- Get my generals assembled!
- Sir.

680
01:04:53,256 --> 01:04:56,054
So nice to see you again, Howl.

681
01:04:56,492 --> 01:04:58,319
You're looking well, madam Suliman.

682
01:04:58,461 --> 01:05:00,854
Rather weak disguise, didn't I teach you better?

683
01:05:00,997 --> 01:05:05,500
I'm not trying to outwit you, I kept my oath,
I reported when summoned.

684
01:05:05,635 --> 01:05:07,368
Now "mother" and I will go.

685
01:05:07,536 --> 01:05:09,333
I'm afraid not.

686
01:05:30,860 --> 01:05:32,919
Now, whatever you do, don't look down.

687
01:05:33,562 --> 01:05:37,096
It's time to show your "mother"
what you really are, Howl.

688
01:06:31,721 --> 01:06:33,450
Stop, Howl! It's a trap!

689
01:06:46,502 --> 01:06:47,794
Hold on!

690
01:06:55,644 --> 01:06:57,305
Sophie, sit up here!

691
01:06:59,048 --> 01:07:00,984
Did you have to bring those two with you?

692
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:05,582
Nice doggie.

693
01:07:06,822 --> 01:07:09,316
I can't believe you work for Suliman.

694
01:07:10,458 --> 01:07:12,120
I guess it's too late to toss him.

695
01:07:12,261 --> 01:07:13,451
Sophie, take the wheel!

696
01:07:13,596 --> 01:07:16,096
What?! I can't fly, are you kidding?!

697
01:07:16,232 --> 01:07:17,722
They're gaining on us.

698
01:07:22,672 --> 01:07:26,137
I'll distract them. Then, you can fly this thing 
back to my castle in the Wastes.

699
01:07:26,275 --> 01:07:28,072
How? I don't know the way!

700
01:07:28,110 --> 01:07:31,070
Hey, don't worry. 
The ring that I gave you will guide you back home.

701
01:07:31,114 --> 01:07:33,744
All you have to do, is summon Calcifer with your heart.

702
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:35,407
Calcifer?

703
01:07:38,788 --> 01:07:39,846
It's glowing.

704
01:07:41,090 --> 01:07:44,125
Just keep following that light 
and you should be there before dark.

705
01:07:44,193 --> 01:07:47,651
I can't do this! 
Why did you make me come here, if you were coming yourself?

706
01:07:47,697 --> 01:07:50,131
Knowing you'd be there gave me the courage to show up.

707
01:07:50,166 --> 01:07:52,966
That woman terrifies me, 
I can't face her on my own.

708
01:07:53,602 --> 01:07:57,561
You've saved me, Sophie.
I was in big trouble back there.

709
01:07:59,608 --> 01:08:01,098
Don't let go!

710
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:09,511
- Wow, you're good.
- Are you nuts?!

711
01:08:11,921 --> 01:08:13,382
We've got a good lead now.

712
01:08:13,489 --> 01:08:16,953
I can give you 5 minutes of invisibility,
so use it wisely.

713
01:08:20,362 --> 01:08:21,761
Howl!

714
01:08:21,961 --> 01:08:23,261
Good luck!

715
01:08:34,043 --> 01:08:35,840
No, not now.

716
01:08:36,312 --> 01:08:39,770
Thank you. 
That was the most fun I've had in ages.

717
01:08:39,849 --> 01:08:43,218
I suppose Howl thinks he's evaded me.

718
01:08:43,619 --> 01:08:46,281
I bet his "mother" can help me find him.

719
01:09:37,173 --> 01:09:39,903
Almost there, 
that's my hometown below us!

720
01:09:42,745 --> 01:09:46,273
Don't try to be cute, dog,
I'm still not going to trust you.

721
01:10:10,339 --> 01:10:12,273
The castle is coming to meet us.

722
01:10:17,046 --> 01:10:19,476
Sophie! Here!

723
01:10:19,548 --> 01:10:21,075
Markl, help me!

724
01:10:21,117 --> 01:10:23,282
How am I supposed to land this thing?!

725
01:10:35,731 --> 01:10:37,130
Sophie.

726
01:10:38,067 --> 01:10:39,557
Nice doggie.

727
01:10:41,604 --> 01:10:42,571
Markl.

728
01:10:43,272 --> 01:10:44,869
I'm home.

729
01:10:45,140 --> 01:10:46,531
Are you hurt?

730
01:10:48,277 --> 01:10:48,909
I missed you!

731
01:10:49,045 --> 01:10:52,246
I missed you too, 
thanks for coming to meet us.

732
01:11:22,144 --> 01:11:25,405
Oh, this is bad, you've gone too far, Howl.

733
01:11:44,133 --> 01:11:46,201
I wonder if Howl's back home.

734
01:12:40,956 --> 01:12:41,982
Howl?

735
01:13:44,353 --> 01:13:46,214
Howl? Is that you?

736
01:13:49,391 --> 01:13:51,591
Are you in pain?
Tell me what's happening.

737
01:13:52,494 --> 01:13:54,394
Go away.

738
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:56,121
No, I'm not going away.

739
01:13:56,265 --> 01:13:58,733
I'm going to help you break 
the spell that you're under.

740
01:13:59,935 --> 01:14:03,034
You... you can't even break your own spell.

741
01:14:03,105 --> 01:14:07,839
- But you don't understand, I love you! 
- You're too late.

742
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:13,377
Howl! No!

743
01:14:26,362 --> 01:14:28,054
Calcifer, did Howl just get in?

744
01:14:28,097 --> 01:14:32,757
Yeah, and he looks terrible.
You better figure out, how to break the spell on us, quick.

745
01:14:33,068 --> 01:14:35,361
Howl is running out of time,
I hope you realize that.

746
01:14:35,604 --> 01:14:37,900
You mean he'll become a monster, is that it?

747
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:41,967
I can't tell you the details of the curse, lady,
you should know that by now, c'mon.

748
01:14:43,746 --> 01:14:45,910
Do you know what madam Suliman said?

749
01:14:46,048 --> 01:14:49,017
She said that Howl's heart was stolen by a demon.

750
01:14:49,151 --> 01:14:54,151
- Tell me now, what do you know?
- I'm so sorry, but that would be confidential information.

751
01:14:54,259 --> 01:14:56,780
What if I dump a bucket of water on you?

752
01:14:56,925 --> 01:14:59,621
If you drown me,
then Howl will die too.

753
01:15:19,548 --> 01:15:21,038
Hi Turnip-head.

754
01:15:21,183 --> 01:15:23,285
This isn't gonna be easy.

755
01:15:26,421 --> 01:15:28,514
'Kay! Ready!

756
01:15:28,724 --> 01:15:32,023
All right! Calcifer, open it wider.

757
01:15:32,695 --> 01:15:35,658
Here we go!

758
01:15:47,508 --> 01:15:50,407
I said move...

759
01:16:14,002 --> 01:16:17,904
If I just hang a little curtain here,
maybe Howl won't notice.

760
01:16:20,208 --> 01:16:22,506
Come on in, it's time to eat!

761
01:16:28,550 --> 01:16:30,477
Here, want some more?

762
01:16:31,820 --> 01:16:34,351
Don't feed her, that's the Witch of the Waste.

763
01:16:34,490 --> 01:16:36,157
Oh, she's all right.

764
01:16:36,291 --> 01:16:38,384
She keeps staring at me,
it's freaking me out...

765
01:16:38,660 --> 01:16:40,958
What a pretty fire.

766
01:16:43,899 --> 01:16:46,059
- Howl, hello.
- Good morning, everyone.

767
01:16:46,201 --> 01:16:49,429
- Glad you're home.
- Master Howl, we can keep this dog, can't we?

768
01:16:49,872 --> 01:16:52,707
The Witch of the Waste and Suliman's dog at my table?

769
01:16:52,841 --> 01:16:55,439
What possessed you to let them in my house, Calcifer?

770
01:16:55,711 --> 01:16:59,708
I didn't let them in!
Sophie crash landed her plane into my face!

771
01:17:02,618 --> 01:17:04,381
I knew she'd make a great pilot.

772
01:17:05,053 --> 01:17:07,521
Looks like we have yet another addition to the family.

773
01:17:09,591 --> 01:17:11,986
You've got a quite nasty spell on you too, huh?

774
01:17:12,728 --> 01:17:14,892
Seems everyone in this family's got problems...

775
01:17:15,030 --> 01:17:17,291
What a handsome man.

776
01:17:17,966 --> 01:17:20,958
So! We've got a lot of work to do.
We're moving!

777
01:17:21,269 --> 01:17:22,167
Moving?

778
01:17:22,304 --> 01:17:25,467
That's good. I'm sick of being stuck out here,
in the middle of nowhere.

779
01:17:25,608 --> 01:17:29,341
Madam Suliman is hot on our trail,
so we're gonna have to hurry.

780
01:17:29,445 --> 01:17:33,741
I'm afraid your spell is too strong for this move.
You're gonna have to stay behind.

781
01:17:39,855 --> 01:17:41,413
There, all done.

782
01:17:42,024 --> 01:17:44,419
All right, Calcifer, line her up!

783
01:17:59,107 --> 01:18:00,668
There, that should do it.

784
01:18:00,809 --> 01:18:02,367
Sit tight for a second.

785
01:18:06,014 --> 01:18:07,914
Be gentle with me, please...

786
01:18:11,453 --> 01:18:12,579
On my mark.

787
01:18:57,065 --> 01:18:59,863
Moving's done,
you can get down now.

788
01:19:02,104 --> 01:19:04,499
This is great, master Howl,
it's huge.

789
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:07,534
Oh, what a pretty fire.

790
01:19:21,623 --> 01:19:22,790
But this is...

791
01:19:22,925 --> 01:19:26,683
I added on a bathroom,
since our family seems to keep growing.

792
01:19:27,328 --> 01:19:28,686
Come over here, Sophie!

793
01:19:33,135 --> 01:19:36,361
I added another bedroom, too.
Have a look.

794
01:19:46,882 --> 01:19:48,577
Why'd you... do this?

795
01:19:48,884 --> 01:19:52,012
So we'd have a room that suited you.
Do you like it?

796
01:19:53,488 --> 01:19:56,787
Of course.
It's perfect for a cleaning lady.

797
01:19:56,958 --> 01:19:59,893
I got you some new clothes, too,
but you can open them later.

798
01:20:00,996 --> 01:20:03,458
Come on, Sophie!
Look at this!

799
01:20:04,066 --> 01:20:05,599
All Right! A courtyard!

800
01:20:05,734 --> 01:20:07,401
That shop's ours, too.

801
01:20:08,103 --> 01:20:09,730
Heen, c'mon!

802
01:20:10,138 --> 01:20:13,601
See that new colour on the dial?
There's a new portal.

803
01:20:16,945 --> 01:20:19,743
It's a present for you.
Come see.

804
01:20:44,873 --> 01:20:47,064
You like it?
It's my secret garden.

805
01:20:47,476 --> 01:20:49,200
It's incredible.

806
01:20:50,846 --> 01:20:53,810
Did you use your magic to make this?

807
01:20:54,182 --> 01:20:57,015
Only a little, just to help the flowers grow.

808
01:21:05,861 --> 01:21:08,052
This place is gorgeous, Howl!

809
01:21:08,197 --> 01:21:10,287
It's like a dream.

810
01:21:33,488 --> 01:21:34,482
Sophie?

811
01:21:35,491 --> 01:21:39,819
It all seems so familiar,
yet I know I've never been her before.

812
01:21:40,162 --> 01:21:42,196
I feel so at home.

813
01:21:42,297 --> 01:21:43,923
- Come with me.
- 'Kay

814
01:21:52,274 --> 01:21:53,366
Look there!

815
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:02,382
- What a cute cottage.
- That was my secret hideaway.

816
01:22:02,618 --> 01:22:05,781
I spent a lot of time here, by myself, 
when I was young.

817
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:09,655
You were alone?

818
01:22:09,925 --> 01:22:13,956
My uncle, who was a wizard,
gave me this place as my private study.

819
01:22:14,329 --> 01:22:16,797
And now you can come here whenever you like.

820
01:22:20,669 --> 01:22:21,658
What's the matter?

821
01:22:22,070 --> 01:22:23,094
It's...

822
01:22:23,338 --> 01:22:26,530
You're scareing me,
I have this weird feeling that you're going to leave.

823
01:22:29,111 --> 01:22:31,506
Howl, tell me what's going on.

824
01:22:31,646 --> 01:22:34,547
Please, I don't care if you're a monster.

825
01:22:39,988 --> 01:22:43,683
I'm just setting things up, 
so that all of you can live a comfortable life, Sophie.

826
01:22:43,925 --> 01:22:48,289
With all the flowers you've got in this valley,
you could easily open up a flower shop.

827
01:22:48,596 --> 01:22:50,928
Right? I'm sure you'd be good at it.

828
01:22:51,199 --> 01:22:53,258
So you are going away...

829
01:22:54,936 --> 01:22:57,928
Please, Howl, I know I can be of help to you.

830
01:22:58,206 --> 01:23:02,306
Even though I'm not pretty
and all I'm good at is cleaning...

831
01:23:02,744 --> 01:23:05,338
Sophie! Sophie, you're beautiful!

832
01:23:09,451 --> 01:23:13,214
Well, the nice thing about being old 
is you've nothing much to lose...

833
01:23:26,568 --> 01:23:28,299
What is that thing doing out here?

834
01:23:28,357 --> 01:23:31,428
- A battleship?
- Still looking for more cities to burn...

835
01:23:31,506 --> 01:23:34,976
- Is it the enemy's or one of ours?
- What difference does it make?

836
01:23:47,355 --> 01:23:48,849
Those stupid murderers...

837
01:23:56,097 --> 01:23:58,895
We can't just let them fly off with all those bombs.

838
01:24:14,950 --> 01:24:16,344
What's happening?

839
01:24:16,484 --> 01:24:17,842
What did you do?

840
01:24:17,986 --> 01:24:20,746
Just messed with it,
it won't crash though.

841
01:24:24,292 --> 01:24:25,122
Howl!

842
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:27,685
Uh-oh... Here they come.

843
01:24:37,372 --> 01:24:40,432
Those things are Suliman's henchmen.
Let's go!

844
01:24:40,775 --> 01:24:42,970
Faster, we need to take off!

845
01:24:56,992 --> 01:24:58,386
All right, you're going in!

846
01:24:58,526 --> 01:25:00,391
No! Don't let go!

847
01:25:09,638 --> 01:25:11,230
Sophie? What happened?

848
01:25:12,407 --> 01:25:14,368
I'm too old to be treated like this!

849
01:25:24,285 --> 01:25:26,016
Good night, Sophie.

850
01:25:26,154 --> 01:25:27,516
Good night, Markl.

851
01:25:29,457 --> 01:25:34,019
Don't worry about Master Howl, Sophie.
Sometimes, he likes to go away for days on end.

852
01:25:34,563 --> 01:25:36,521
Thank you, that's good to know.

853
01:25:36,865 --> 01:25:39,097
- Need anything else? 
- No, I'm fine.

854
01:25:39,134 --> 01:25:41,095
Well, good night then.

855
01:25:41,703 --> 01:25:42,635
You're in love.

856
01:25:45,607 --> 01:25:48,906
Don't deny it,
you've been sighing all day.

857
01:26:00,655 --> 01:26:02,350
Just as I thought.

858
01:26:02,624 --> 01:26:04,922
Have you ever in love before?

859
01:26:05,059 --> 01:26:07,960
Of course I have.
I'm still in love.

860
01:26:09,531 --> 01:26:15,331
Strapping, young men are so difficult to deal with,
but their hearts I just adore.

861
01:26:15,670 --> 01:26:17,137
You're terrible.

862
01:26:17,305 --> 01:26:20,130
And they're so cute, too.

863
01:26:23,545 --> 01:26:25,012
What's that?

864
01:26:25,146 --> 01:26:26,443
It's an air raid siren.

865
01:26:27,482 --> 01:26:28,546
Air raid?

866
01:26:29,784 --> 01:26:33,845
It's a long way's off,
but you better not go outside tonight, dear.

867
01:26:35,190 --> 01:26:39,752
I'm sure Suliman's henchmen are looking 
everywhere for this place.

868
01:26:42,697 --> 01:26:46,958
What a good fire.
He keeps this house so well hidden.

869
01:27:22,103 --> 01:27:24,669
Sophie, there's a strange lady in here!

870
01:27:32,280 --> 01:27:33,247
Mother?

871
01:27:33,581 --> 01:27:35,674
Sophie!

872
01:27:37,952 --> 01:27:41,144
Thank goodness you're here!
I searched everywhere for you!

873
01:27:41,356 --> 01:27:44,184
Oh my, look at your face, you're so old!

874
01:27:44,525 --> 01:27:46,784
Everyone’s saying it's my fault that you left.

875
01:27:47,529 --> 01:27:51,554
You'll forgive me, oh won't you?
Oh, Sophie.

876
01:27:51,666 --> 01:27:53,099
Mother...

877
01:27:55,770 --> 01:27:58,068
I barely recognize the place.

878
01:27:58,139 --> 01:27:59,768
Who is that woman?

879
01:27:59,907 --> 01:28:01,898
Huh? The landlady?

880
01:28:02,076 --> 01:28:05,239
Oh, I forgot to tell you,
I got married again.

881
01:28:05,413 --> 01:28:10,075
He's such a nice man and he's filthy rich, too,
so we can all live together again.

882
01:28:10,385 --> 01:28:12,853
You won't have to work as a cleaning lady anymore.

883
01:28:13,454 --> 01:28:16,548
That's all right, mother, 
I actually like living here.

884
01:28:16,691 --> 01:28:18,181
Really?

885
01:28:18,626 --> 01:28:19,350
I forgot.

886
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:22,022
I've got a car waiting,
I've got to run.

887
01:28:23,001 --> 01:28:25,793
Sophie, I'm so glad I found you.

888
01:28:40,381 --> 01:28:44,242
A peeping-bug?
Can't Suliman do better than that?

889
01:28:44,385 --> 01:28:45,943
Open wide, Cal.

890
01:28:54,896 --> 01:28:57,428
I hope you and your new husband will be very happy.

891
01:28:57,565 --> 01:29:00,759
- Thank you, Sophie. Bye.
- Bye, mother.

892
01:29:04,605 --> 01:29:07,802
I did what I was told,
now take me to my husband.

893
01:29:07,942 --> 01:29:10,843
Yes ma'am, I'm sure Madam Suliman 
will be very pleased with your.

894
01:29:13,047 --> 01:29:14,844
Forgive me, Sophie...

895
01:29:18,886 --> 01:29:20,319
Oh, look at all of them.

896
01:29:20,788 --> 01:29:24,253
If they keep leaving at this rate,
the town will soon be empty.

897
01:29:24,392 --> 01:29:26,822
- Do you want to leave, too, Sophie?
- What?

898
01:29:27,695 --> 01:29:29,822
That lady said she wants you to live with her now.

899
01:29:29,964 --> 01:29:33,597
Yes, well...
At least she cared enough to visit.

900
01:29:33,901 --> 01:29:35,435
Don't leave, Sophie!

901
01:29:36,568 --> 01:29:38,803
I love you,
you have to stay...

902
01:29:41,476 --> 01:29:44,409
I love you, too, Markl.
I'll stay.

903
01:29:44,545 --> 01:29:45,842
Really?

904
01:29:46,814 --> 01:29:48,338
'Cause we're a family now.

905
01:29:48,516 --> 01:29:50,447
Yes, we're a family.

906
01:29:50,852 --> 01:29:52,319
Thank you, Sophie.

907
01:30:00,361 --> 01:30:03,389
I will never let Suliman 
get a hold of Howl.

908
01:30:20,281 --> 01:30:22,308
But the newspaper says we won.

909
01:30:22,450 --> 01:30:25,248
Only idiots believe what they read in the paper.

910
01:30:26,354 --> 01:30:29,915
That's so strange,
I can't get Calcifer going.

911
01:30:30,658 --> 01:30:32,389
Do you have to keep smoking that?

912
01:30:32,593 --> 01:30:34,083
It smells terrible.

913
01:30:34,462 --> 01:30:37,231
Don't deny an old witch her pleasures, young lady.

914
01:30:37,799 --> 01:30:39,730
Markl, will you crack a window, please?

915
01:30:43,304 --> 01:30:46,102
I wouldn't open that window if I were you, dear.

916
01:30:47,375 --> 01:30:50,405
Calcifer's too weak right now 
to protect this place.

917
01:30:50,505 --> 01:30:52,605
Suliman's henchmen could get in. 

918
01:30:54,215 --> 01:30:55,307
Markl!

919
01:31:13,768 --> 01:31:16,562
Markl, get back inside, 
I'm gonna check on the shop.

920
01:31:35,156 --> 01:31:39,517
There are bombs falling on us, 
why won't you put out some fires instead?

921
01:32:03,951 --> 01:32:04,815
Howl, no!

922
01:32:18,533 --> 01:32:20,000
This is exciting.

923
01:32:33,347 --> 01:32:34,177
Howl!

924
01:32:36,384 --> 01:32:38,916
I'm sorry, Sophie,
I should've gotten here sooner.

925
01:32:39,620 --> 01:32:42,384
You're alive.
Oh, thank goodness.

926
01:32:59,273 --> 01:33:01,400
Master Howl! Sophie!
You're okay!

927
01:33:03,911 --> 01:33:07,137
Calcifer, you hang in there now!

928
01:33:11,919 --> 01:33:16,083
Tell me... Was that cigar a gift from Madam Suliman,
by any chance?

929
01:33:16,524 --> 01:33:19,516
Howl, she fed me something gross, I feel sick.

930
01:33:20,161 --> 01:33:22,527
Why, if it isn't Howl.

931
01:33:22,930 --> 01:33:26,759
I think you and I need to have a nice, 
long, heart-to-heart chat.

932
01:33:26,901 --> 01:33:31,132
There's nothing I'd like more than that,
but right now there's a war going on.

933
01:33:32,272 --> 01:33:35,936
How unlike you, Howl,
not running away anymore.

934
01:33:36,077 --> 01:33:37,704
Until later, then.

935
01:33:38,646 --> 01:33:41,506
Stay here,
Calcifer will protect you from the henchmen.

936
01:33:41,649 --> 01:33:43,714
I'll stand guard out front.

937
01:33:45,353 --> 01:33:46,684
No, wait, Howl!

938
01:33:46,821 --> 01:33:49,415
Don't go out there! 
It's too dangerous.

939
01:33:49,624 --> 01:33:53,291
Another wave's coming
and Calcifer is too weak to stop the bombs.

940
01:33:53,461 --> 01:33:55,626
Let's run,
don't fight them, Howl.

941
01:33:55,897 --> 01:33:58,622
Sorry, I've had enough of running away, Sophie.

942
01:33:59,300 --> 01:34:02,094
And now, I've got something I wanna protect.

943
01:34:02,136 --> 01:34:03,662
It's you.

944
01:34:08,476 --> 01:34:09,465
Come back!

945
01:35:34,161 --> 01:35:35,526
There's where we are at the shop.

946
01:35:39,967 --> 01:35:41,393
Looks like Howl's in trouble.

947
01:35:50,478 --> 01:35:51,742
Howl, look out!

948
01:36:01,722 --> 01:36:03,587
What's going on?!
Turnip!

949
01:36:07,495 --> 01:36:09,156
Markl, I need your help!

950
01:36:09,463 --> 01:36:12,364
Are you crazy? 
I can't move the portals without Howl's help.

951
01:36:12,566 --> 01:36:15,865
You have to try, if we don't break away,
Howl will keep protecting the hat shop.

952
01:36:15,903 --> 01:36:17,895
I preferred him as a coward.

953
01:36:18,038 --> 01:36:19,562
Okay, we have to go now.

954
01:36:19,740 --> 01:36:21,430
Are we going for a stroll?

955
01:36:21,642 --> 01:36:23,610
We can't do that,
it'll make us too vulnerable.

956
01:36:23,911 --> 01:36:27,278
We already are! And if we don't move quick, 
Howl doesn't have a chance.

957
01:36:27,414 --> 01:36:28,676
Sophie!

958
01:36:28,816 --> 01:36:30,113
They're about to bomb the hat shop!

959
01:36:30,317 --> 01:36:33,087
Quick! Help her get outside, okay?

960
01:36:35,790 --> 01:36:37,157
You coming with us, 
hop on.

961
01:36:37,258 --> 01:36:41,253
I can't! It's impossible,
no one, but Howl, can take me out of this hearth.

962
01:36:41,729 --> 01:36:44,254
There's no time to lose, Calcifer,
we have to try something.

963
01:36:45,232 --> 01:36:47,059
Don't do this! 
No! No! No! Help! Help! Help! Help!

964
01:36:47,100 --> 01:36:48,593
Crazy lady with a shovel! Don't!

965
01:36:48,837 --> 01:36:51,864
If you take me out that door,
the castle could collapse!

966
01:36:51,906 --> 01:36:52,770
Good!

967
01:36:56,677 --> 01:36:58,208
- We're ready!
- Okay, step back.

968
01:36:58,312 --> 01:37:00,680
Make sure I go out last, Sophie.

969
01:37:01,215 --> 01:37:04,412
I don't know what's gonna happen...
but I'm sure it won't be good.

970
01:37:33,147 --> 01:37:35,477
I told you it would collapse.

971
01:37:35,616 --> 01:37:37,513
Rain! Rain! Rain!

972
01:37:39,753 --> 01:37:41,277
That ship's headed for town!

973
01:37:41,422 --> 01:37:42,780
Markl, look after her, okay?

974
01:37:42,923 --> 01:37:45,023
Turnip-head, help me find a way back in.

975
01:37:46,093 --> 01:37:48,459
Don't you worry now, ma'am,
I'm gonna take good care of you.

976
01:37:51,398 --> 01:37:53,559
Markl, here's a way in.

977
01:38:03,344 --> 01:38:05,872
Please, oh ple-, uh, watch, the roof is leaking,
don't make it wet.

978
01:38:05,913 --> 01:38:07,575
- Please, don't make it wet.
- Hold on for a second.

979
01:38:07,715 --> 01:38:09,813
It's wet here, Sophie!

980
01:38:11,290 --> 01:38:17,252
Too damp, too damp, damp, very damp here,
hu-hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, please.

981
01:38:24,932 --> 01:38:26,495
Markl, hurry, get inside.

982
01:38:26,867 --> 01:38:28,630
The castle's a wreck.

983
01:38:28,769 --> 01:38:32,530
Told you we should have stayed put,
Howl and I could've handled it.

984
01:38:34,612 --> 01:38:37,442
We have to tell Howl, 
we're not attached to the hat shop now.

985
01:38:37,642 --> 01:38:39,742
Move the castle and take us to Howl.

986
01:38:40,442 --> 01:38:41,442
What?

987
01:38:41,716 --> 01:38:45,443
I know you can do it,
I've never seen a fire with more spark.

988
01:38:45,720 --> 01:38:48,085
But there's no chim-,
but there's no chimney here,

989
01:38:48,156 --> 01:38:50,921
and I keep getting dripped on 
and the wood's all damp...

990
01:38:51,025 --> 01:38:55,825
They say that the best blaze brightest 
when circumstances are at their worst.

991
01:38:55,963 --> 01:38:58,393
Yeah, but no one really believes that...

992
01:38:58,532 --> 01:38:59,592
Come on, let's be honest...

993
01:38:59,634 --> 01:39:02,034
Uh, what a pretty fire.

994
01:39:02,169 --> 01:39:03,397
Why don't you have a seat?

995
01:39:03,904 --> 01:39:06,498
All right, I need something of yours, Sophie.

996
01:39:06,774 --> 01:39:07,672
Why is that?

997
01:39:07,808 --> 01:39:10,299
I can't do it by myself.
How about your eyes?

998
01:39:10,444 --> 01:39:11,570
Huh?

999
01:39:11,879 --> 01:39:13,141
How about this?

1000
01:40:18,712 --> 01:40:21,340
Thanks, Calcifer!
You're fantastic!

1001
01:40:21,582 --> 01:40:24,678
Imagine what I could have done with 
your eyes or your heart.

1002
01:40:24,885 --> 01:40:27,820
That's it! You've got Howl's heart!

1003
01:40:30,424 --> 01:40:32,016
I found it!

1004
01:40:44,572 --> 01:40:47,406
I can see Howl down there.
Looks like he's trapped.

1005
01:40:52,613 --> 01:40:54,308
Calcifer, hurry!

1006
01:40:54,982 --> 01:40:56,449
No!

1007
01:40:57,251 --> 01:40:58,218
Put it back!

1008
01:40:58,852 --> 01:41:00,114
Let go!

1009
01:41:00,988 --> 01:41:02,922
Howl's heart, it's mine!

1010
01:41:14,635 --> 01:41:16,002
Put it back, now!

1011
01:41:18,305 --> 01:41:21,671
- It's hot, hot! Burning me!
- Let go!

1012
01:41:21,876 --> 01:41:23,900
You're catching on fire!

1013
01:41:24,744 --> 01:41:27,371
No, it's mine! It's mine!

1014
01:41:28,771 --> 01:41:30,971
It's mine!

1015
01:41:44,465 --> 01:41:45,955
Sophie!

1016
01:41:49,703 --> 01:41:50,931
Sophie!

1017
01:41:51,272 --> 01:41:55,171
Sophie ruined it.
My heart's ruined.

1018
01:42:38,318 --> 01:42:42,279
Heen, what've I done?
I poured water on Calcifer.

1019
01:42:44,958 --> 01:42:47,756
What if I've killed Howl, too?

1020
01:43:14,321 --> 01:43:16,983
It's moving...
Is Howl still alive?

1021
01:43:17,124 --> 01:43:18,989
Can you lead me to him?

1022
01:43:40,781 --> 01:43:42,305
The front door...

1023
01:45:00,627 --> 01:45:01,594
Heen?

1024
01:45:37,197 --> 01:45:38,095
That's Howl...

1025
01:45:56,783 --> 01:45:59,308
I know where I am,
I'm in Howl's childhood.

1026
01:47:18,432 --> 01:47:20,229
Howl!
Calcifer!

1027
01:47:21,969 --> 01:47:26,027
It's me, Sophie! 
I know how to help you now!

1028
01:47:27,074 --> 01:47:29,342
Find me in the future!

1029
01:48:02,476 --> 01:48:05,143
Sorry, Heen,
I'm trying to hurry.

1030
01:48:05,779 --> 01:48:07,371
I just can't seem to stop crying.

1031
01:48:32,038 --> 01:48:33,169
Howl.

1032
01:48:39,713 --> 01:48:42,614
I'm sorry...
Did I come too late?

1033
01:48:42,883 --> 01:48:45,545
I didn't mean to make you wait this long.

1034
01:48:49,856 --> 01:48:52,784
I need you to take me to Calcifer, if you can.

1035
01:49:55,755 --> 01:49:56,744
He's dead?

1036
01:49:57,290 --> 01:49:58,687
No, Markl.

1037
01:50:03,029 --> 01:50:04,526
Howl needs that back now.

1038
01:50:04,564 --> 01:50:08,159
Don't look at me, I don't have it,
I don't know what you're talking about.

1039
01:50:08,602 --> 01:50:09,569
Please.

1040
01:50:11,505 --> 01:50:13,238
Please give it back.

1041
01:50:16,242 --> 01:50:18,767
You really want it that badly?

1042
01:50:18,912 --> 01:50:20,038
Yes.

1043
01:50:20,981 --> 01:50:25,008
- All right then. You'd better take good care of it.
- 'Kay.

1044
01:50:25,518 --> 01:50:26,883
Here, dear.

1045
01:50:28,154 --> 01:50:30,418
Thank you, you have a big heart.

1046
01:50:46,439 --> 01:50:47,904
Calcifer.

1047
01:50:49,142 --> 01:50:51,638
Sophie, I'm so tired...

1048
01:50:51,778 --> 01:50:55,345
If I give Howl back his heart,
what will happen to you?

1049
01:50:55,482 --> 01:50:57,973
I'd be okay, if you do it, I think...

1050
01:50:58,052 --> 01:51:02,616
I mean, you dumped water on me 
and Howl and I both survived.

1051
01:51:03,056 --> 01:51:04,523
I'd better try then.

1052
01:51:07,727 --> 01:51:10,992
It’s so warm and fluttering like a bird.

1053
01:51:11,131 --> 01:51:13,492
It's still just the heart of a child.

1054
01:51:14,501 --> 01:51:17,293
Please... Help Calcifer live.

1055
01:51:17,437 --> 01:51:20,663
And please help Howl take back his heart.

1056
01:51:32,719 --> 01:51:33,486
I'm alive!

1057
01:51:34,120 --> 01:51:36,278
I'm alive! Look! I'm free! Free!

1058
01:51:38,578 --> 01:51:40,478
I'm alive, I tell you!

1059
01:51:41,761 --> 01:51:43,661
He moved! See?

1060
01:51:48,168 --> 01:51:49,965
I can't steer without Calcifer!

1061
01:52:05,118 --> 01:52:06,116
Turnip!

1062
01:52:18,632 --> 01:52:20,097
His pole snapped.

1063
01:52:20,133 --> 01:52:22,567
Are you all right? 
We'll get you a new pole, okay?

1064
01:52:25,038 --> 01:52:27,006
You saved us, Turnip.

1065
01:52:35,014 --> 01:52:36,538
Thank you, Sophie.

1066
01:52:37,484 --> 01:52:39,845
I'm the prince, 
who's been missing from the neighbouring kingdom.

1067
01:52:39,986 --> 01:52:42,181
Somehow, I got that blasted spell put on me.

1068
01:52:42,455 --> 01:52:45,692
I know that spell.
A kiss, from your true love, breaks it.

1069
01:52:46,102 --> 01:52:47,120
That's right.

1070
01:52:47,220 --> 01:52:50,420
If it weren't for Sophie, I would've been 
a scarecrow for the rest of my life!

1071
01:52:50,764 --> 01:52:52,933
My, what a stunning, young man, you are.

1072
01:52:53,033 --> 01:52:55,895
What's going on?
What am I doing here?

1073
01:52:56,370 --> 01:52:59,239
I feel terrible,
like there's a weight on my chest.

1074
01:52:59,839 --> 01:53:01,975
A heart's a heavy burden.

1075
01:53:02,408 --> 01:53:05,845
Wow, Sophie, your hair looks 
just like starlight.

1076
01:53:06,179 --> 01:53:07,380
It's beautiful.

1077
01:53:07,480 --> 01:53:09,778
You think so?
So do I!

1078
01:53:11,985 --> 01:53:14,621
Looks like your true love 
is in love with someone else.

1079
01:53:14,821 --> 01:53:18,424
You should go home anyway,
and tell your king to stop this dumb war.

1080
01:53:18,725 --> 01:53:20,260
Yes, that's exactly what I'll do.

1081
01:53:20,627 --> 01:53:23,553
One thing you can always count on,
is that hearts change.

1082
01:53:23,797 --> 01:53:26,499
So as soon as this war is over,
I shall return.

1083
01:53:26,900 --> 01:53:29,169
I love it, when you talk like that.

1084
01:53:29,269 --> 01:53:31,905
I'll look forward to your return, big boy.

1085
01:53:38,845 --> 01:53:42,348
There you are.
You should've checked in earlier.

1086
01:53:42,448 --> 01:53:44,382
What on earth were you up to?

1087
01:53:47,687 --> 01:53:49,923
Howl found his true love.

1088
01:53:50,089 --> 01:53:51,750
You little traitor.

1089
01:53:58,598 --> 01:54:00,500
The game is over.

1090
01:54:00,867 --> 01:54:04,325
Get me the Prime Minister and 
the Minister of Defence.

1091
01:54:05,104 --> 01:54:08,596
- It's time to put an end to this idiotic war.
- Yes, ma'am

1092
01:54:09,542 --> 01:54:11,009
Hey, it's Calcifer!

1093
