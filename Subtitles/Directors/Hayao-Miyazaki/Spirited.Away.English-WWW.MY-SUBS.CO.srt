1
00:00:07,091 --> 00:00:10,762
Tokuma Shoten, Studio Ghibli, Nippon Television Network,
Dentsu, Walt Disney Japan, Tohokushinsha Film
and Mitsubishi present

2
00:00:13,348 --> 00:00:15,892
<i>Good luck, Chihiro</i>
<i>Hope we meet again</i>

3
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,895
Chihiro? Chihiro!

4
00:00:19,103 --> 00:00:20,563
We're almost there.

5
00:00:23,525 --> 00:00:25,485
This really is the middle of nowhere.

6
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:28,404
I'll have to shop in the next town.

7
00:00:28,571 --> 00:00:30,615
We'll just have to make do.

8
00:00:33,034 --> 00:00:35,036
Look, there's the elementary school.

9
00:00:35,161 --> 00:00:36,955
That's your new school, Chihiro.

10
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:40,083
Why, it looks very nice.

11
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:49,926
I liked my old school.

12
00:00:54,138 --> 00:00:56,975
Mom, my flowers got bent.

13
00:00:57,225 --> 00:00:59,686
No wonder,
the way you squeeze them.

14
00:00:59,811 --> 00:01:02,772
A little water
and they'll perk right up.

15
00:01:03,815 --> 00:01:07,402
My first bouquet,
and it's farewell flowers.

16
00:01:07,527 --> 00:01:10,989
What about the rose
you got for your birthday?

17
00:01:11,114 --> 00:01:14,117
One rose?
One rose isn't a bouquet.

18
00:01:14,284 --> 00:01:15,910
You dropped the card.

19
00:01:16,035 --> 00:01:20,415
Now pull yourself together.
This is a busy day for us.

20
00:01:39,642 --> 00:01:44,814
SPIRITED AWAY

21
00:01:57,201 --> 00:02:01,164
Wait a minute.
Did I take a wrong turn?

22
00:02:01,623 --> 00:02:03,082
I don't get it.

23
00:02:03,207 --> 00:02:05,335
That must be it up there.

24
00:02:06,169 --> 00:02:08,212
The blue one on the end.

25
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:09,964
That's it.

26
00:02:10,548 --> 00:02:13,051
I guess I turned off too soon.

27
00:02:13,301 --> 00:02:15,178
Maybe if we go straight?

28
00:02:15,345 --> 00:02:17,847
Oh, please.
That's how we always get lost.

29
00:02:17,972 --> 00:02:19,974
Let's just see what's up here.

30
00:02:20,391 --> 00:02:24,020
- What are those things?
- Houses for the guardian spirits.

31
00:02:30,902 --> 00:02:32,487
Dad, are you sure?

32
00:02:32,612 --> 00:02:35,198
Don't worry, we've got 4-wheel drive.

33
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,158
Sit down, Chihiro.

34
00:02:57,345 --> 00:02:59,639
What are you doing? Slow down!

35
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,475
There's a tunnel.

36
00:03:17,031 --> 00:03:18,658
What's this building?

37
00:03:18,783 --> 00:03:20,618
It looks like a gate.

38
00:03:21,536 --> 00:03:24,580
Honey, I think we should go back.

39
00:03:25,248 --> 00:03:26,624
Chihiro!

40
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:29,127
Honestly...

41
00:03:29,544 --> 00:03:31,879
Look at this, it's just plaster.

42
00:03:32,088 --> 00:03:34,090
This thing's pretty new.

43
00:03:44,225 --> 00:03:45,601
The air's blowing in.

44
00:03:46,227 --> 00:03:47,186
What is it?

45
00:03:47,311 --> 00:03:49,605
Let's see what's on the other side.

46
00:03:50,231 --> 00:03:52,358
It's creepy, Dad.
Can't we go back?

47
00:03:52,817 --> 00:03:56,779
Don't be such a chicken.
C'mon, let's take a look.

48
00:03:56,946 --> 00:03:59,115
The movers will be there soon.

49
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:03,286
So? They've got the keys.
They'll handle everything.

50
00:04:03,411 --> 00:04:04,454
I know, but...

51
00:04:04,579 --> 00:04:06,539
No! I won't go.

52
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:10,585
Dad, let's go.

53
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:12,170
Come on, it'll be fun.

54
00:04:12,336 --> 00:04:14,005
I'm staying here!

55
00:04:22,263 --> 00:04:24,766
Chihiro, you wait in the car.

56
00:04:26,684 --> 00:04:28,603
Mom...

57
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:31,898
Wait up!

58
00:04:37,445 --> 00:04:39,071
Watch your step.

59
00:04:39,197 --> 00:04:42,533
Chihiro, don't cling.
You'll make me trip.

60
00:05:14,565 --> 00:05:17,860
- What is this?
- Wait, hear that?

61
00:05:26,661 --> 00:05:29,539
- A train.
- Maybe we're near a station.

62
00:05:29,705 --> 00:05:31,541
Let's find out.
It must be close.

63
00:06:08,369 --> 00:06:10,496
Houses, way out here?

64
00:06:10,621 --> 00:06:12,248
I knew it.

65
00:06:12,623 --> 00:06:15,418
It's an abandoned theme park.

66
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:20,590
They built lots of them
back in the nineties.

67
00:06:20,756 --> 00:06:23,259
But they went bust
when the economy tanked.

68
00:06:23,593 --> 00:06:25,928
This must be one of them.

69
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:28,014
Wait, where are we going?

70
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:30,766
Let's go back, Dad.

71
00:06:33,728 --> 00:06:35,396
Please!

72
00:06:44,989 --> 00:06:47,909
Mom, that building's moaning.

73
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:49,243
It's just the wind.

74
00:06:49,744 --> 00:06:54,248
What a lovely spot.
We should've brought the sandwiches.

75
00:06:57,251 --> 00:06:59,128
This would've been a river.

76
00:07:04,592 --> 00:07:06,260
Do you smell something?

77
00:07:07,011 --> 00:07:10,181
- Something smells good.
- You're right.

78
00:07:10,306 --> 00:07:13,100
Maybe they're open
for business after all.

79
00:07:13,434 --> 00:07:14,977
Hurry up, Chihiro.

80
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:17,188
Wait for me!

81
00:07:50,179 --> 00:07:51,639
This way.

82
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:59,188
Can you believe it?
Nothing but restaurants.

83
00:07:59,355 --> 00:08:01,524
There's nobody here.

84
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:05,486
Over there.

85
00:08:09,657 --> 00:08:11,826
Come on!

86
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,547
Come take a look.

87
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:29,301
This is amazing.

88
00:08:29,427 --> 00:08:32,346
Hello, is anybody here?

89
00:08:32,471 --> 00:08:34,890
Come on, Chihiro.
It looks delicious.

90
00:08:35,266 --> 00:08:36,350
You got customers!

91
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:44,817
Don't worry.
We'll pay when they show up.

92
00:08:44,942 --> 00:08:47,486
You're right.
Let's see now...

93
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:49,739
What kind of bird is this?

94
00:08:51,449 --> 00:08:54,368
It's delicious! Chihiro, try some.

95
00:08:54,869 --> 00:08:55,870
I don't want any.

96
00:08:56,078 --> 00:08:58,998
Can't we go?
They'll be mad at us.

97
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:02,418
Don't worry, your father's here.

98
00:09:02,585 --> 00:09:04,712
I've got credit cards and cash.

99
00:09:08,716 --> 00:09:11,385
Have some, Chihiro.
It's very tender.

100
00:09:13,137 --> 00:09:15,097
- Mustard.
- Thanks.

101
00:09:25,816 --> 00:09:28,486
Mom! Dad!

102
00:10:37,805 --> 00:10:39,390
What a weird building.

103
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:10,921
A train!

104
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:23,392
You can't be here.
Go now!

105
00:11:24,435 --> 00:11:27,396
It's almost sundown.
Go before it gets dark!

106
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:32,193
They're lighting the lamps.
Come on!

107
00:11:32,318 --> 00:11:34,904
I'll hold them off.
Get across the river!

108
00:11:49,126 --> 00:11:51,253
What's his problem?

109
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,971
Dad?

110
00:12:01,972 --> 00:12:03,599
Dad, let's go home.

111
00:12:03,766 --> 00:12:05,476
Let's go, Dad!

112
00:12:32,253 --> 00:12:33,754
Dad!

113
00:12:34,255 --> 00:12:35,297
Mom!

114
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:46,767
Mommy!

115
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:09,832
Water!

116
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,513
No...

117
00:13:24,638 --> 00:13:26,390
It's just a dream.

118
00:13:28,892 --> 00:13:31,270
Wake up, wake up.
Wake up!

119
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:34,273
Please wake up.

120
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:42,031
It's just a dream, a stupid dream.

121
00:13:42,573 --> 00:13:45,117
Go away, disappear.

122
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:46,910
Disappear.

123
00:13:54,918 --> 00:13:56,420
I'm fading away!

124
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:01,675
This has to be a dream.

125
00:14:54,478 --> 00:14:56,772
Don't be afraid.
I'm a friend.

126
00:14:57,189 --> 00:14:58,941
No, no, no!

127
00:14:59,358 --> 00:15:01,068
Open your mouth. Eat this.

128
00:15:01,276 --> 00:15:04,029
Unless you eat something
from this world, you'll disappear.

129
00:15:04,154 --> 00:15:05,447
No!

130
00:15:09,535 --> 00:15:12,621
Don't worry.
You won't turn into a pig.

131
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:14,623
Chew it and swallow.

132
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,635
Good, now you'll be fine.

133
00:15:26,802 --> 00:15:28,470
See for yourself.

134
00:15:36,687 --> 00:15:37,938
I can touch you.

135
00:15:38,063 --> 00:15:40,357
Of course.
Now come.

136
00:15:40,482 --> 00:15:44,486
Where's Mom and Dad?
Did they really turn into pigs?

137
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:47,239
You can't see them now,
but you will.

138
00:15:50,492 --> 00:15:51,535
Quiet!

139
00:16:09,678 --> 00:16:12,890
It's looking for you.
There's no time, let's run.

140
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:16,685
I can't stand up.
What should I do?

141
00:16:16,935 --> 00:16:20,731
- My legs don't work.
- Relax and take a deep breath.

142
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:28,614
In the name of the wind and
water within, unbind her.

143
00:16:28,864 --> 00:16:29,865
Stand up!

144
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:15,118
Don't breathe while we're on the bridge.

145
00:17:16,411 --> 00:17:21,500
One tiny breath will break my spell.
We don't want anyone to see you.

146
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,215
I'm scared.

147
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:29,883
Be calm.

148
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:33,053
Welcome, your presence honors us.

149
00:17:33,178 --> 00:17:35,389
Greetings, welcome.

150
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:38,892
- I've finished my rounds.
- Welcome back, sir.

151
00:17:40,102 --> 00:17:41,853
Take a deep breath.

152
00:17:43,021 --> 00:17:44,106
Hold it.

153
00:18:01,123 --> 00:18:04,793
Welcome back.
We've been waiting for you.

154
00:18:06,044 --> 00:18:07,879
Just a little further.

155
00:18:08,797 --> 00:18:10,382
Master Haku!

156
00:18:11,133 --> 00:18:12,759
Where have you...

157
00:18:14,219 --> 00:18:15,971
A human?

158
00:18:16,888 --> 00:18:18,098
Run!

159
00:18:34,656 --> 00:18:36,950
Master Haku, Master Haku!

160
00:18:37,075 --> 00:18:39,703
I smell something.
A human intruder!

161
00:18:39,828 --> 00:18:42,080
I smell humans!
The stench of humans!

162
00:18:42,205 --> 00:18:44,875
- They know you're here.
- Sorry, I messed up.

163
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,169
No, Chihiro, you did very well.

164
00:18:47,502 --> 00:18:49,921
Now listen.
I'll tell you what to do.

165
00:18:50,088 --> 00:18:51,673
If you stay here, they'll find you.

166
00:18:52,341 --> 00:18:55,636
I'll distract them while you get away.

167
00:18:55,761 --> 00:18:58,180
No, don't go!
Stay with me, please.

168
00:18:58,847 --> 00:19:01,850
You have no choice,
if you want to survive here...

169
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:03,685
and save your parents, too.

170
00:19:04,728 --> 00:19:07,356
So I wasn't dreaming.
They did turn into pigs.

171
00:19:07,522 --> 00:19:08,940
Listen carefully.

172
00:19:09,858 --> 00:19:13,320
<i>After I'm gone,</i>
<i>go through the back gate.</i>

173
00:19:13,445 --> 00:19:16,323
<i>Take the stairs</i>
<i>all the way down.</i>

174
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:18,575
<i>You'll find</i>
<i>the boiler room where...</i>

175
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,202
<i>they stoke the fires.</i>

176
00:19:20,369 --> 00:19:23,664
<i>Look for Kamaji.</i>

177
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:25,165
Kamaji?

178
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:28,627
Ask him for work.

179
00:19:28,752 --> 00:19:30,420
If he refuses, keep asking.

180
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:34,424
If you don't work,
Yubaba will turn you into an animal.

181
00:19:34,883 --> 00:19:36,051
Yubaba?

182
00:19:36,218 --> 00:19:38,929
She's the sorceress who rules our world.

183
00:19:39,262 --> 00:19:42,474
She'll try to trick you into leaving...

184
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:44,184
but keep asking for work.

185
00:19:44,518 --> 00:19:49,147
The work's hard, but it will protect you.
Then even Yubaba can't harm you.

186
00:19:50,524 --> 00:19:53,193
Master Haku, Master Haku!

187
00:19:53,485 --> 00:19:54,611
I have to go.

188
00:19:54,736 --> 00:19:58,949
- Remember I'm your friend, Chihiro.
- How did you know my name?

189
00:19:59,408 --> 00:20:01,451
You told me long ago.

190
00:20:01,743 --> 00:20:03,704
My name is Haku.

191
00:20:06,581 --> 00:20:08,417
Here I am!

192
00:20:10,335 --> 00:20:12,629
Master Haku, Yubaba's waiting.

193
00:20:12,754 --> 00:20:15,757
I know, I've been searching too.

194
00:24:23,922 --> 00:24:25,799
Um...

195
00:24:26,675 --> 00:24:28,009
Excuse me.

196
00:24:34,849 --> 00:24:36,184
Um...

197
00:24:42,899 --> 00:24:45,235
Are you Kamaji?

198
00:24:53,034 --> 00:24:56,705
Haku sent me.
Please let me work here.

199
00:25:01,126 --> 00:25:04,546
What, all at once?

200
00:25:05,213 --> 00:25:07,465
Get to work, you little runts!

201
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:13,930
I am Kamaji, slave to the boilers
that heat the baths.

202
00:25:14,055 --> 00:25:16,224
Step on it, boys!

203
00:25:17,392 --> 00:25:19,477
Please let me work here.

204
00:25:19,602 --> 00:25:23,857
I've got all the help I need.
There's soot everywhere.

205
00:25:23,982 --> 00:25:26,901
I'll never run out of help.

206
00:25:41,332 --> 00:25:43,334
Oh, I'm sorry.

207
00:25:47,005 --> 00:25:49,090
Wait a second.

208
00:26:00,935 --> 00:26:02,437
Out of the way.

209
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:57,742
Wait, what do I do with this?

210
00:27:04,457 --> 00:27:06,126
Do I leave it here?

211
00:27:06,501 --> 00:27:08,628
Finish what you start.

212
00:28:08,271 --> 00:28:12,066
Get to work, runts!
Wanna turn back into soot?

213
00:28:12,233 --> 00:28:15,904
And you, better watch it.
You can't just take someone's work.

214
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:19,574
If they don't work,
their spell will be broken.

215
00:28:19,699 --> 00:28:22,827
There's no work for you here.
Try somewhere else.

216
00:28:31,836 --> 00:28:34,339
You sootballs got a problem?

217
00:28:34,464 --> 00:28:35,965
Get to work!

218
00:28:37,008 --> 00:28:38,635
Chow time!

219
00:28:38,927 --> 00:28:41,346
What, you guys at it again?

220
00:28:43,264 --> 00:28:46,184
Give it a rest.
Where's your bowl?

221
00:28:47,143 --> 00:28:49,145
I keep telling you to leave it out.

222
00:28:49,395 --> 00:28:51,940
Food's here.
Break time!

223
00:29:07,538 --> 00:29:09,666
The human! You're gonna catch it.

224
00:29:09,791 --> 00:29:12,001
They're having a fit about it upstairs.

225
00:29:13,211 --> 00:29:15,004
She's my granddaughter.

226
00:29:15,129 --> 00:29:16,589
Your granddaughter!

227
00:29:17,465 --> 00:29:21,177
She says she wants work,
but I don't need any help.

228
00:29:21,302 --> 00:29:24,806
Could you take her
to Yubaba for me?

229
00:29:24,973 --> 00:29:26,766
This girl can handle herself.

230
00:29:26,891 --> 00:29:29,310
Not a chance.
Yubaba would kill me.

231
00:29:29,435 --> 00:29:34,232
Not even for this?
Charcoal-roasted newt, finest quality.

232
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:40,321
If you want work, you have to
sign a contract with Yubaba.

233
00:29:40,446 --> 00:29:42,657
Might as well try your luck.

234
00:29:43,825 --> 00:29:46,661
Fine!
You there, follow me.

235
00:29:52,959 --> 00:29:55,503
What about
"Yes, ma'am" or "Thank you"?

236
00:29:55,628 --> 00:29:57,005
Yes, ma'am.

237
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:58,506
What a klutz.
Move it!

238
00:29:58,631 --> 00:29:59,590
Yes, ma'am.

239
00:30:02,218 --> 00:30:05,263
Leave the shoes.
And the socks!

240
00:30:05,388 --> 00:30:06,556
Yes'm.

241
00:30:11,936 --> 00:30:15,982
Aren't you going to thank Kamaji?
He's looking out for you.

242
00:30:18,192 --> 00:30:20,153
Thank you very much.

243
00:30:21,612 --> 00:30:22,989
Good luck.

244
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:35,543
Yubaba lives on
the top floor in the back.

245
00:30:50,058 --> 00:30:52,393
Move it, will you?

246
00:30:56,689 --> 00:30:58,274
You'll lose your nose.

247
00:31:23,091 --> 00:31:25,802
- One more elevator after this.
- Yes'm.

248
00:31:30,223 --> 00:31:31,432
We're here.

249
00:31:34,769 --> 00:31:36,145
Welcome, sir!

250
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:46,531
This elevator stops here.
Please use another one.

251
00:32:09,262 --> 00:32:11,681
- He's following us.
- Quit gawking.

252
00:32:26,988 --> 00:32:29,365
Here we are.

253
00:32:34,036 --> 00:32:36,622
Your room is on the right.

254
00:32:39,333 --> 00:32:41,627
- Lin?
- Yes sir!

255
00:32:43,171 --> 00:32:44,964
Something smells.

256
00:32:45,548 --> 00:32:47,800
It's human.
You reek of human.

257
00:32:47,925 --> 00:32:49,260
Is that so?

258
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:52,722
I smell it, I do.
Smells mighty tasty, too.

259
00:32:53,306 --> 00:32:55,725
You're hiding something.

260
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:58,186
Tell me the truth.

261
00:32:58,352 --> 00:32:59,604
Maybe it's this.

262
00:33:00,062 --> 00:33:02,356
Roasted newt? Give it here!

263
00:33:02,523 --> 00:33:05,735
Not a chance.
The girls asked me to get it.

264
00:33:05,985 --> 00:33:08,988
I'm begging you.
I'll settle for a leg.

265
00:33:10,031 --> 00:33:12,992
Pull the lever to go up, sir.

266
00:34:58,347 --> 00:35:00,349
Can't you even knock?

267
00:35:01,142 --> 00:35:04,103
What a plain little girl.

268
00:35:14,363 --> 00:35:16,365
Now, come.

269
00:35:19,785 --> 00:35:21,746
I said, come!

270
00:35:36,302 --> 00:35:38,471
Ow...

271
00:35:48,814 --> 00:35:51,692
What a racket.
Could you be quiet?

272
00:36:10,711 --> 00:36:11,837
Please...

273
00:36:12,213 --> 00:36:14,340
Let me work here.

274
00:36:22,807 --> 00:36:25,893
Stop your babbling.

275
00:36:26,018 --> 00:36:29,313
Why do I need
a weakling like you?

276
00:36:29,563 --> 00:36:33,818
Besides, this is no place for humans.

277
00:36:35,027 --> 00:36:37,321
Millions of spirits come here...

278
00:36:37,446 --> 00:36:41,283
to purge themselves of toil and care.

279
00:36:42,201 --> 00:36:45,413
Your parents, my goodness!
They certainly had some nerve.

280
00:36:45,538 --> 00:36:49,125
Gobbling our guests' food
like a couple of pigs.

281
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:51,377
Just deserts, I'd say.

282
00:36:51,919 --> 00:36:57,216
And as for you, you'll never
see your world again either.

283
00:37:00,928 --> 00:37:03,764
You'd make a lovely piglet.

284
00:37:04,098 --> 00:37:06,976
Or perhaps a lump of coal?

285
00:37:14,775 --> 00:37:16,360
Trembling, aren't you?

286
00:37:16,485 --> 00:37:20,114
Still, I'm impressed
you made it this far.

287
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:23,492
Someone must've helped you.

288
00:37:23,784 --> 00:37:25,870
I must thank your friend.

289
00:37:25,995 --> 00:37:30,624
Just who was it, my dear?
You can tell me.

290
00:37:33,627 --> 00:37:35,171
Please let me work here!

291
00:37:35,296 --> 00:37:36,839
Not that again!

292
00:37:36,964 --> 00:37:38,382
I want to work here!

293
00:37:38,716 --> 00:37:43,637
Shut your mouth!

294
00:37:47,266 --> 00:37:51,061
Why on earth should I hire you?

295
00:37:51,187 --> 00:37:55,483
Anyone can see you're
a lazy, spoiled, stupid crybaby.

296
00:37:55,649 --> 00:38:00,654
What job would I possibly have
for someone like you?

297
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:06,660
You're wasting your time.
I've got all the bums I need.

298
00:38:07,578 --> 00:38:11,832
Or maybe I'll give you
the nastiest job I've got...

299
00:38:11,957 --> 00:38:14,001
and work you night and day...

300
00:38:14,126 --> 00:38:19,048
until you breathe your very last breath!

301
00:38:31,602 --> 00:38:34,855
Now, now.
What's wrong, my dear?

302
00:38:35,689 --> 00:38:38,359
I'm coming.
That's a good baby.

303
00:38:38,818 --> 00:38:41,362
Are you still here?
Get out, right now.

304
00:38:41,654 --> 00:38:43,405
I want to work here!

305
00:38:43,697 --> 00:38:47,117
Keep your voice down.

306
00:38:47,243 --> 00:38:50,913
I'll be right there, just be patient.

307
00:38:51,831 --> 00:38:54,416
That's a good baby.
There, there.

308
00:38:54,708 --> 00:38:56,794
Please give me a job!

309
00:38:56,919 --> 00:38:59,713
All right, just pipe down.

310
00:39:00,047 --> 00:39:04,593
There, there, good baby.

311
00:39:24,697 --> 00:39:26,448
That's your contract.

312
00:39:27,283 --> 00:39:29,451
Sign on the bottom line.

313
00:39:30,077 --> 00:39:31,579
I'll put you to work.

314
00:39:32,246 --> 00:39:35,165
But one peep out of you
about anything...

315
00:39:35,291 --> 00:39:37,751
and I'll turn you into a piglet.

316
00:39:38,544 --> 00:39:40,504
Should I sign here?

317
00:39:40,629 --> 00:39:44,133
Where else?
Quit dilly-dallying.

318
00:39:48,762 --> 00:39:50,931
Unbelievable.

319
00:39:51,432 --> 00:39:54,268
What a ridiculous oath I took.

320
00:39:55,686 --> 00:39:59,273
I'm bound to give work
to whoever asks.

321
00:40:01,609 --> 00:40:03,402
- Finished?
- Yes.

322
00:40:08,282 --> 00:40:10,492
- Chihiro, that's your name?
- Yes.

323
00:40:10,784 --> 00:40:13,454
Quite a fancy name.

324
00:40:22,922 --> 00:40:25,674
From now on, your name is Sen.

325
00:40:26,133 --> 00:40:27,968
Understand? Sen.

326
00:40:28,093 --> 00:40:30,679
Answer me, Sen!

327
00:40:30,971 --> 00:40:32,264
I understand.

328
00:40:32,431 --> 00:40:33,641
Yes ma'am?

329
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:41,065
- See to her, she's starting work today.
- Very well.

330
00:40:41,815 --> 00:40:42,942
What is your name?

331
00:40:43,984 --> 00:40:46,695
Chi... I mean, Sen.

332
00:40:46,987 --> 00:40:49,156
Then follow me, Sen.

333
00:40:57,665 --> 00:40:58,999
Haku, I...

334
00:40:59,333 --> 00:41:01,001
No idle chatter.

335
00:41:01,126 --> 00:41:03,462
Call me Master Haku.

336
00:41:19,144 --> 00:41:22,356
I'm afraid even Yubaba
can't give an order like that.

337
00:41:22,481 --> 00:41:24,149
Humans aren't allowed here.

338
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:26,193
She signed the contract.

339
00:41:26,318 --> 00:41:28,529
- What!
- I'll work hard.

340
00:41:28,821 --> 00:41:32,282
- Don't send her to us.
- She stinks to high heaven.

341
00:41:33,033 --> 00:41:35,869
She won't stink
after three days of our food.

342
00:41:35,995 --> 00:41:40,207
If she doesn't measure up,
do with her as you will.

343
00:41:42,042 --> 00:41:44,294
Now go back to work.
Where's Lin?

344
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:46,797
What, you're dumping her on me?

345
00:41:47,089 --> 00:41:48,549
You wanted an assistant.

346
00:41:48,716 --> 00:41:51,635
That's right! Lin's just perfect.

347
00:41:52,052 --> 00:41:53,137
Go, Sen.

348
00:41:53,262 --> 00:41:54,263
Yes sir.

349
00:41:55,055 --> 00:41:58,392
What a pain.
You're gonna pay for this.

350
00:41:58,851 --> 00:42:00,519
Off you go.

351
00:42:02,896 --> 00:42:04,189
Come on.

352
00:42:13,032 --> 00:42:14,533
You pulled it off!

353
00:42:15,159 --> 00:42:17,286
You're so thick, I was worried.

354
00:42:17,703 --> 00:42:21,373
Keep your wits about you.
If you need anything, ask me.

355
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:24,793
What's wrong?

356
00:42:25,753 --> 00:42:27,796
My legs are shaking.

357
00:42:32,259 --> 00:42:34,386
This is where we live.

358
00:42:35,387 --> 00:42:37,765
Eat, sleep and you'll be fine.

359
00:42:40,768 --> 00:42:42,644
Your apron.
Keep it clean.

360
00:42:42,936 --> 00:42:44,021
Trousers.

361
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:46,899
You're so puny.

362
00:42:47,566 --> 00:42:49,068
Too big.

363
00:42:51,111 --> 00:42:52,696
Lin, are there...

364
00:42:52,821 --> 00:42:53,781
What?

365
00:42:53,947 --> 00:42:56,033
Are there two Hakus here?

366
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:59,703
Two of that one?
I sure hope not.

367
00:43:00,287 --> 00:43:01,288
Still too big.

368
00:43:01,413 --> 00:43:04,166
He's Yubaba's apprentice.
Be careful around him.

369
00:43:07,586 --> 00:43:09,755
Now where was that...

370
00:43:10,464 --> 00:43:12,633
All right, here we go.

371
00:43:13,967 --> 00:43:18,097
Hey, are you okay?
Don't fall apart on me.

372
00:43:18,972 --> 00:43:21,308
What's all the noise, Lin?

373
00:43:21,433 --> 00:43:23,852
New girl.
Says she feels faint.

374
00:44:55,861 --> 00:45:00,115
Meet me at the bridge.
I'll take you to your mother and father.

375
00:45:44,451 --> 00:45:45,494
My shoes are gone.

376
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:01,426
Thank you.

377
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:11,330
Follow me.

378
00:47:54,373 --> 00:47:56,958
Dad, Mom, it's me!

379
00:47:57,501 --> 00:47:58,794
It's Sen.

380
00:47:59,503 --> 00:48:01,880
Mom! Dad!

381
00:48:05,008 --> 00:48:06,927
Are they sick? Are they hurt?

382
00:48:07,094 --> 00:48:09,805
They're just sleeping.
Their stomachs are full.

383
00:48:10,555 --> 00:48:13,475
They don't remember
they were ever human.

384
00:48:19,106 --> 00:48:21,525
Listen to me!
I promise I'll save you.

385
00:48:21,650 --> 00:48:24,820
Don't get too fat
or they'll eat you.

386
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:34,704
Hide these.

387
00:48:37,624 --> 00:48:38,959
I thought they were gone.

388
00:48:39,459 --> 00:48:41,294
For when you go home.

389
00:48:47,426 --> 00:48:49,761
This was a farewell card.

390
00:48:51,179 --> 00:48:52,681
Chihiro?

391
00:48:53,098 --> 00:48:56,184
Chihiro...
That's my name!

392
00:48:57,227 --> 00:48:59,688
Yubaba controls us
by stealing our names.

393
00:49:00,439 --> 00:49:04,526
You're Sen here.
Keep your real name a secret.

394
00:49:04,818 --> 00:49:07,946
She almost got my name.
I was turning into Sen.

395
00:49:08,822 --> 00:49:12,033
Without your real name,
you'll never find your way home.

396
00:49:12,993 --> 00:49:15,454
I no longer remember mine.

397
00:49:15,662 --> 00:49:17,456
Your real name?

398
00:49:17,664 --> 00:49:21,001
But it's strange,
I remember yours.

399
00:49:23,462 --> 00:49:26,047
Better eat, you must be hungry.

400
00:49:26,339 --> 00:49:27,716
I don't want to.

401
00:49:28,008 --> 00:49:32,095
I put a spell on them
to give you back your strength.

402
00:50:08,548 --> 00:50:11,176
You've had a rough time.
Better eat more.

403
00:50:26,066 --> 00:50:27,359
You know the way back.

404
00:50:27,484 --> 00:50:30,153
Thanks Haku.
I promise to work hard.

405
00:52:05,123 --> 00:52:07,584
Where were you? I was worried.

406
00:52:07,709 --> 00:52:08,918
Sorry.

407
00:52:18,219 --> 00:52:20,055
Out of the way.

408
00:52:32,901 --> 00:52:35,153
Come on,
give it some elbow grease.

409
00:52:35,654 --> 00:52:38,239
Starting today, you two
are on the big tub.

410
00:52:38,531 --> 00:52:40,533
What? That's Frog work!

411
00:52:40,659 --> 00:52:43,745
Orders from the top.
And no shirking, either.

412
00:53:03,848 --> 00:53:05,767
Aren't you getting wet?

413
00:53:09,896 --> 00:53:11,481
Sen, come on!

414
00:53:11,606 --> 00:53:12,899
Coming!

415
00:53:13,066 --> 00:53:14,776
I'll leave this open.

416
00:53:42,721 --> 00:53:44,681
- On the big tub, Lin?
- Stuff it.

417
00:53:48,309 --> 00:53:51,479
Just look at this.
Hasn't been scrubbed in ages.

418
00:54:05,994 --> 00:54:09,164
The big tub is reserved
for our filthiest guests.

419
00:54:09,330 --> 00:54:10,999
It's caked with sludge.

420
00:54:11,291 --> 00:54:13,752
Lin! Sen!
First customers are coming.

421
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:15,545
All right already!

422
00:54:15,670 --> 00:54:17,881
Man, this is pure harassment.

423
00:54:18,006 --> 00:54:21,134
Go get a tag
from the foreman.

424
00:54:21,259 --> 00:54:22,343
A tag?

425
00:54:25,138 --> 00:54:27,015
For an herbal bath.

426
00:54:27,265 --> 00:54:28,516
Right.

427
00:54:29,642 --> 00:54:31,269
Lin, what's a foreman?

428
00:54:35,523 --> 00:54:38,318
Something's coming.
I wonder...

429
00:54:47,327 --> 00:54:51,164
Is some good-for-nothing
using the rain to sneak in?

430
00:55:15,438 --> 00:55:17,941
Absolutely not,
it's too valuable to waste.

431
00:55:18,191 --> 00:55:19,859
Good morning!

432
00:55:20,318 --> 00:55:22,278
Feeling refreshed?

433
00:55:22,695 --> 00:55:23,863
For Kasuga.

434
00:55:23,988 --> 00:55:26,157
One deluxe sulfur bath.

435
00:55:26,533 --> 00:55:28,993
No point standing there.
Back to work.

436
00:55:29,369 --> 00:55:30,870
Scrub it with your hands.

437
00:55:31,037 --> 00:55:32,747
Good morning!

438
00:55:33,039 --> 00:55:33,998
Your bare hands.

439
00:55:34,123 --> 00:55:37,377
But she said
it has to be an herbal bath.

440
00:55:37,502 --> 00:55:39,128
You just don't get it.

441
00:55:39,254 --> 00:55:41,214
Mugwort, right?

442
00:55:41,548 --> 00:55:43,508
Relax and enjoy.

443
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:55,228
Foreman.
Yes ma'am!

444
00:55:57,313 --> 00:55:58,356
Thank you!

445
00:55:58,481 --> 00:55:59,607
But that's not...

446
00:55:59,816 --> 00:56:01,234
Hey you, wait!

447
00:56:01,401 --> 00:56:02,235
<i>What's the trouble?</i>

448
00:56:02,402 --> 00:56:03,820
Oh, nothing at all.

449
00:56:04,195 --> 00:56:05,738
We have an intruder.

450
00:56:05,905 --> 00:56:06,698
<i>A human?</i>

451
00:56:06,823 --> 00:56:09,826
You figure it out.
Haku's gone today.

452
00:56:10,034 --> 00:56:12,412
Wow, you got a really good one.

453
00:56:12,537 --> 00:56:15,081
This goes straight to Kamaji.

454
00:56:16,666 --> 00:56:18,501
Water should be right up.

455
00:56:24,549 --> 00:56:27,468
Yank this for hot water.
Go ahead, try it.

456
00:56:36,144 --> 00:56:38,479
You're really are a klutz.

457
00:56:38,646 --> 00:56:40,732
Look at that color.

458
00:56:40,857 --> 00:56:43,151
This one has dried worm salts.

459
00:56:43,735 --> 00:56:46,654
With water this murky,
who's gonna see the sludge?

460
00:56:48,781 --> 00:56:51,618
Yank it again
when it's full. It'll stop.

461
00:56:52,076 --> 00:56:55,413
You can let go now.
I'll go get our breakfast.

462
00:56:55,538 --> 00:56:56,789
Okay.

463
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:21,230
Ouch!

464
00:57:25,276 --> 00:57:27,946
Um...
The bath's not ready yet.

465
00:57:33,493 --> 00:57:34,953
So many...

466
00:57:37,664 --> 00:57:39,582
They're for me?

467
00:57:42,710 --> 00:57:45,213
But I don't need them.

468
00:57:47,966 --> 00:57:49,717
No, you gave me one already.

469
00:58:04,649 --> 00:58:05,608
Madam!

470
00:58:05,733 --> 00:58:09,278
- It's a Stink Spirit.
- Yes, and a large one, too.

471
00:58:09,404 --> 00:58:11,155
It's headed straight for the bridge!

472
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:13,658
Please turn back.

473
00:58:14,367 --> 00:58:17,662
Please go!
The baths are closed for the night.

474
00:58:17,912 --> 00:58:20,373
Please withdraw, please!

475
00:58:20,540 --> 00:58:23,167
Stinky!

476
00:58:23,376 --> 00:58:27,255
That's odd.
Stink Spirits feel different.

477
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:29,924
Well, now that it's here,
better go greet it!

478
00:58:30,633 --> 00:58:34,178
All we can do
is get rid of it fast.

479
00:58:34,762 --> 00:58:36,556
Everyone, please return to your rooms!

480
00:58:36,723 --> 00:58:38,433
Please hurry.
Terribly sorry!

481
00:58:40,393 --> 00:58:42,520
Lin and Sen, Yubaba wants you.

482
00:58:42,645 --> 00:58:43,438
Yes sir!

483
00:58:43,688 --> 00:58:46,274
Pay attention, this is your debut.

484
00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:49,193
Show the customer to the big tub.

485
00:58:50,194 --> 00:58:52,196
Remember, one peep
out of you and you're coal.

486
00:58:52,447 --> 00:58:55,366
- Got it?
- It has arrived.

487
00:59:05,668 --> 00:59:07,754
No, that's not polite!

488
00:59:15,803 --> 00:59:19,265
Welgum to our bazz.

489
00:59:22,643 --> 00:59:24,604
Oh...
Money...!

490
00:59:24,771 --> 00:59:27,315
Hurry Sen, take it!

491
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:28,691
Yez ma'am.

492
00:59:36,991 --> 00:59:41,579
Wud are you wading for?
Show him to da bazz!

493
00:59:41,704 --> 00:59:43,456
Diz way...

494
01:00:01,974 --> 01:00:03,643
Sen!

495
01:00:07,939 --> 01:00:10,441
Horrible!

496
01:00:11,526 --> 01:00:12,485
Breakfast!

497
01:00:12,610 --> 01:00:14,695
Open the windows, all of 'em!

498
01:00:57,905 --> 01:01:00,575
What? Just a minute.

499
01:01:06,205 --> 01:01:08,958
- That's really filthy.
- It's not funny.

500
01:01:09,083 --> 01:01:10,668
What will she do?

501
01:01:15,256 --> 01:01:17,633
Ah, she's going to refill the tub.

502
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:21,721
Oh dear, she's soiling the walls
with her dirty hands!

503
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:35,735
Did you give Sen new tags?

504
01:01:35,902 --> 01:01:38,529
Never, what a waste!

505
01:02:19,820 --> 01:02:22,448
All that precious herbal essence!

506
01:02:48,516 --> 01:02:50,768
Sen! Sen, where are you?

507
01:02:50,893 --> 01:02:53,145
- Lin!
- Are you okay?

508
01:02:53,271 --> 01:02:55,940
I asked Kamaji to help us out.

509
01:02:56,482 --> 01:02:58,567
He's sending his
best herbal essence.

510
01:02:58,985 --> 01:03:02,196
Thanks. There's a thorn
or something stuck in him.

511
01:03:02,321 --> 01:03:03,322
A thorn?

512
01:03:03,447 --> 01:03:05,074
I can't pull it out.

513
01:03:05,324 --> 01:03:07,910
A thorn? Hmm...

514
01:03:09,370 --> 01:03:11,038
Get everyone downstairs!

515
01:03:11,163 --> 01:03:11,956
Hurry!

516
01:03:15,543 --> 01:03:17,003
Sen and Lin!

517
01:03:17,211 --> 01:03:19,588
Our guest is no Stink Spirit.

518
01:03:21,716 --> 01:03:23,259
Use this rope.

519
01:03:23,384 --> 01:03:24,468
Yes ma'am!

520
01:03:33,227 --> 01:03:34,729
Tie it good and tight!

521
01:03:36,314 --> 01:03:39,942
Hurry up!
Girls, lend a hand!

522
01:03:40,276 --> 01:03:41,944
It's tied!

523
01:03:43,154 --> 01:03:46,532
Everyone ready? All together now!

524
01:03:46,657 --> 01:03:49,452
Heave!

525
01:03:50,077 --> 01:03:51,954
And heave!

526
01:03:52,204 --> 01:03:54,457
Heave!

527
01:03:54,582 --> 01:03:56,709
Heave!

528
01:04:04,550 --> 01:04:05,468
A bicycle?

529
01:04:06,093 --> 01:04:09,472
I knew it.
Now, heave!

530
01:04:09,722 --> 01:04:12,224
Heave!

531
01:04:43,798 --> 01:04:46,425
Sen, are you all right?

532
01:04:56,602 --> 01:04:59,397
Well done.

533
01:05:28,801 --> 01:05:30,970
Gold! It's gold!

534
01:05:31,137 --> 01:05:33,722
Hands off! That's company property.

535
01:05:33,848 --> 01:05:37,309
Quiet! Our guest is still with us.

536
01:05:43,190 --> 01:05:46,152
Sen, you're in the way.
Get down from there.

537
01:05:46,318 --> 01:05:48,821
Open the main gates!
He's leaving!

538
01:06:15,556 --> 01:06:19,685
Sen, you're a wonder!
You made us a fortune.

539
01:06:20,394 --> 01:06:22,980
That was the guardian
of a great river.

540
01:06:23,105 --> 01:06:24,773
Everyone, learn from Sen!

541
01:06:25,357 --> 01:06:27,359
Sake on the house tonight.

542
01:06:27,860 --> 01:06:30,529
Now hand over all
that gold you picked up.

543
01:06:44,168 --> 01:06:46,170
Want some? I swiped them.

544
01:06:46,670 --> 01:06:48,047
Thanks.

545
01:06:48,214 --> 01:06:50,382
What a day.

546
01:06:52,885 --> 01:06:54,303
Haku missed the whole thing.

547
01:06:54,428 --> 01:06:56,305
Not Haku again!

548
01:06:57,223 --> 01:06:59,600
Sometimes he just disappears.

549
01:07:00,059 --> 01:07:03,812
They say Yubaba makes
him do bad stuff.

550
01:07:03,938 --> 01:07:04,730
Really?

551
01:07:04,897 --> 01:07:06,273
Lights out, Lin.

552
01:07:06,398 --> 01:07:07,441
Okay.

553
01:07:32,633 --> 01:07:35,302
There's a town.
And the water's like an ocean.

554
01:07:35,469 --> 01:07:38,472
What did you expect
after all that rain?

555
01:07:40,307 --> 01:07:44,311
I'm gonna get there someday.
I'll get out of here for sure.

556
01:08:08,794 --> 01:08:10,129
What's wrong?

557
01:08:39,700 --> 01:08:41,201
Gold!

558
01:08:44,038 --> 01:08:47,041
Who are you? You're no customer.

559
01:08:47,166 --> 01:08:48,917
You're not allowed in there.

560
01:08:55,341 --> 01:08:58,719
Hey, it's gold! For me?

561
01:09:04,016 --> 01:09:06,352
You can make gold?

562
01:09:11,899 --> 01:09:12,858
Gimme!

563
01:09:21,075 --> 01:09:22,785
Who's down here?

564
01:09:23,827 --> 01:09:26,205
It's way past lights out.

565
01:09:29,750 --> 01:09:33,045
Hey boss, I'm hungry.

566
01:09:33,170 --> 01:09:34,213
Starved, in fact.

567
01:09:34,380 --> 01:09:35,255
That voice...

568
01:09:35,381 --> 01:09:37,299
There, I'll pay you now.

569
01:09:38,050 --> 01:09:40,678
I'm a customer.
I want a bath.

570
01:09:40,803 --> 01:09:42,429
Wake everyone up!

571
01:09:47,935 --> 01:09:51,230
Mom and Dad, the river guardian
gave me this medicine.

572
01:09:51,397 --> 01:09:54,274
If you take it,
you'll be people again.

573
01:09:58,404 --> 01:10:00,406
Dad, Mom, where are you?

574
01:10:00,781 --> 01:10:02,032
Daddy!

575
01:10:13,127 --> 01:10:14,294
What an awful dream.

576
01:10:15,921 --> 01:10:17,089
Lin?

577
01:10:21,260 --> 01:10:22,803
Where is everybody?

578
01:10:29,309 --> 01:10:32,104
Wow, it really did
turn into an ocean!

579
01:10:37,359 --> 01:10:40,362
I can see where Mom and
Dad are from here.

580
01:10:44,074 --> 01:10:46,034
Kamaji lit the fires already.

581
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:48,078
Did I sleep that long?

582
01:10:51,749 --> 01:10:54,752
The customer's waiting.
Can't you work faster?

583
01:10:54,877 --> 01:10:58,881
Serve everything you've got,
even leftovers!

584
01:11:00,841 --> 01:11:01,759
Sen!

585
01:11:01,884 --> 01:11:02,885
Lin?

586
01:11:03,093 --> 01:11:05,846
I was just coming
to wake you up, look!

587
01:11:06,096 --> 01:11:08,348
Gold! He gave me real gold.

588
01:11:08,682 --> 01:11:10,726
We've got a real high roller.

589
01:11:10,851 --> 01:11:13,228
Please, sir, try this!

590
01:11:17,357 --> 01:11:19,985
Throw us some gold!

591
01:11:21,987 --> 01:11:25,324
I'm starving, bring it all!

592
01:11:29,995 --> 01:11:31,246
Who's this guest?

593
01:11:31,538 --> 01:11:34,917
Come on, Yubaba's still asleep.
Now's your chance.

594
01:11:35,375 --> 01:11:37,252
I'm going to see Kamaji.

595
01:11:37,878 --> 01:11:40,005
I wouldn't go there now.

596
01:11:40,130 --> 01:11:42,341
He's angry because they woke him up.

597
01:11:42,508 --> 01:11:44,343
Lin, let's go back for more.

598
01:12:09,535 --> 01:12:12,871
What if I can't recognize my parents?

599
01:12:13,705 --> 01:12:16,458
I hope Dad hasn't gotten too fat.

600
01:12:44,736 --> 01:12:46,238
That's the dragon I saw.

601
01:12:46,738 --> 01:12:48,240
It's coming this way.

602
01:12:50,951 --> 01:12:52,286
Those aren't birds!

603
01:13:03,672 --> 01:13:06,800
Haku, don't give up.
Over here!

604
01:13:08,385 --> 01:13:09,469
Haku!

605
01:13:28,864 --> 01:13:30,032
It's just paper.

606
01:13:58,310 --> 01:14:00,479
Haku? It is you, isn't it?

607
01:14:06,652 --> 01:14:09,947
Are you hurt?
Those paper birds are gone.

608
01:14:10,072 --> 01:14:11,365
You're safe now.

609
01:14:24,544 --> 01:14:26,296
He's going to Yubaba.

610
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:29,341
What should I do? He'll die!

611
01:14:37,015 --> 01:14:41,561
Now the richest man
in the whole wide world...

612
01:14:41,895 --> 01:14:45,941
has come to grace us
with his presence.

613
01:14:46,984 --> 01:14:48,902
Greetings!

614
01:14:49,027 --> 01:14:52,364
Now let us appeal
to his generosity.

615
01:14:52,656 --> 01:14:54,700
Please, sir! Over here.

616
01:14:58,161 --> 01:14:59,329
I hope I get some.

617
01:14:59,454 --> 01:15:01,456
They say gold
springs from his palms.

618
01:15:02,332 --> 01:15:05,377
Toss some this way, sir!

619
01:15:09,381 --> 01:15:10,757
What are you doing?

620
01:15:10,882 --> 01:15:11,842
Going upstairs.

621
01:15:11,967 --> 01:15:14,011
No you don't.
What's this?

622
01:15:14,720 --> 01:15:15,971
Blood!

623
01:15:19,891 --> 01:15:22,144
Out of the way,
we have a guest.

624
01:15:23,729 --> 01:15:25,522
Thank you for your help.

625
01:15:25,897 --> 01:15:28,316
Get out of the way!

626
01:15:50,255 --> 01:15:51,923
I don't need it.

627
01:15:54,843 --> 01:15:57,179
I'm busy, please excuse me.

628
01:16:08,815 --> 01:16:11,693
Quiet! Quiet down.

629
01:16:12,360 --> 01:16:14,029
Back, get back!

630
01:16:14,446 --> 01:16:16,573
Please excuse her manners.

631
01:16:16,698 --> 01:16:20,243
The girl is new and a human.

632
01:16:22,788 --> 01:16:25,373
What's so funny?
Wipe off that smile.

633
01:16:25,624 --> 01:16:26,958
Why, I would never...

634
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:34,257
He ate them!

635
01:18:01,178 --> 01:18:02,429
Yubaba!

636
01:19:15,043 --> 01:19:17,921
We're in a fine mess now.

637
01:19:18,546 --> 01:19:20,632
He's a No Face.

638
01:19:20,799 --> 01:19:22,759
That's right, a No Face!

639
01:19:23,051 --> 01:19:25,971
Your greed attracted quite a guest.

640
01:19:26,471 --> 01:19:29,724
Don't do anything stupid
until I get down there.

641
01:19:30,308 --> 01:19:32,686
Just look at this carpet.

642
01:19:32,811 --> 01:19:35,063
Get Haku out of here.

643
01:19:35,188 --> 01:19:37,065
He's useless to me now.

644
01:19:59,546 --> 01:20:02,632
Bo, sleeping outside
your crib again?

645
01:20:06,553 --> 01:20:10,682
Oh I'm sorry, you were
sleeping like such a good baby.

646
01:20:10,849 --> 01:20:13,768
Baba still has work to do.

647
01:20:16,688 --> 01:20:19,482
Go back to sleep now,
that's a good baby.

648
01:20:47,510 --> 01:20:49,429
Ouch, let me go!

649
01:20:49,888 --> 01:20:51,723
Oh, thanks for helping me.

650
01:20:51,848 --> 01:20:55,143
But I'm in a hurry,
please let me go.

651
01:20:55,268 --> 01:20:57,604
You came to make me sick.

652
01:20:58,146 --> 01:21:00,732
The outside has bad germs.

653
01:21:01,608 --> 01:21:05,487
I'm a human.
Maybe you never saw one before.

654
01:21:05,737 --> 01:21:08,031
You'll get sick out there.

655
01:21:08,156 --> 01:21:10,241
Stay here and play with me.

656
01:21:10,408 --> 01:21:11,951
Are you sick?

657
01:21:12,077 --> 01:21:14,913
I'm in here 'cause
I'll get sick outside.

658
01:21:15,038 --> 01:21:17,499
Staying inside will make you sick!

659
01:21:17,624 --> 01:21:21,378
You see, someone I really
care about is badly hurt.

660
01:21:21,503 --> 01:21:23,129
I've got to go right now.

661
01:21:23,254 --> 01:21:24,631
Please let me go.

662
01:21:24,839 --> 01:21:29,969
If you go, I'll start crying.
Then Baba will come and kill you.

663
01:21:30,136 --> 01:21:31,846
I'll break your little arm.

664
01:21:31,971 --> 01:21:33,098
You're hurting me!

665
01:21:33,264 --> 01:21:35,767
Please, I'll come play with you later.

666
01:21:35,934 --> 01:21:37,519
No, I wanna play now!

667
01:21:41,523 --> 01:21:43,691
Blood! See? It's blood!

668
01:21:55,286 --> 01:21:56,788
Haku!

669
01:21:57,122 --> 01:21:59,207
Go away!

670
01:21:59,332 --> 01:22:00,417
It's you, isn't it?

671
01:22:00,625 --> 01:22:01,960
Hang on!

672
01:22:02,419 --> 01:22:03,378
Be quiet!

673
01:22:03,503 --> 01:22:04,629
Haku!

674
01:22:10,427 --> 01:22:11,386
Go away!

675
01:22:14,055 --> 01:22:15,390
No!

676
01:22:30,488 --> 01:22:34,242
I'm not afraid of blood.
I'll cry if you don't play.

677
01:22:34,409 --> 01:22:36,244
Please be a good boy and wait.

678
01:22:36,870 --> 01:22:39,664
If you don't play
with me I'll cry...

679
01:22:41,666 --> 01:22:43,042
Please, wait!

680
01:22:43,168 --> 01:22:46,463
What a racket.
Simmer down.

681
01:22:47,755 --> 01:22:50,175
You're a little butterball, aren't you?

682
01:22:58,016 --> 01:23:00,226
I <i>am</i> a bit transparent here.

683
01:23:00,351 --> 01:23:01,186
Baba...

684
01:23:01,853 --> 01:23:05,773
Oh dear, can't you even tell
me from your own mother?

685
01:23:14,115 --> 01:23:16,868
There, that gives you
a little more freedom.

686
01:23:16,993 --> 01:23:20,288
Let's see now.
What shall we turn you into?

687
01:23:38,306 --> 01:23:41,017
This is our little secret.
If you tell anyone...

688
01:23:41,142 --> 01:23:43,186
I'll do the same to you.

689
01:23:44,729 --> 01:23:45,897
Who are you?

690
01:23:46,064 --> 01:23:48,441
Yubaba's older twin sister.

691
01:23:48,566 --> 01:23:52,362
Thanks to you I've had
a nice tour of the place.

692
01:23:52,487 --> 01:23:54,447
Now hand over the dragon.

693
01:23:54,697 --> 01:23:57,075
What are you going to do?
He needs help.

694
01:23:57,408 --> 01:24:00,537
That dragon's a thief.
He works for my sister.

695
01:24:00,703 --> 01:24:03,706
He stole a valuable seal from my house.

696
01:24:03,831 --> 01:24:06,584
Haku would never do that.
He's too kind.

697
01:24:07,085 --> 01:24:10,630
All dragons are kind.
Kind and stupid...

698
01:24:10,755 --> 01:24:15,343
and eager to learn
my sister's magical ways.

699
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:19,347
This boy will do anything
that greedy woman wants.

700
01:24:19,597 --> 01:24:21,683
Now step aside.

701
01:24:21,808 --> 01:24:24,269
It's too late for him anyway.

702
01:24:24,435 --> 01:24:27,564
The thing he stole
had a protection spell.

703
01:24:27,689 --> 01:24:29,816
Now the thief will die.

704
01:24:30,608 --> 01:24:32,277
No, don't!

705
01:24:39,784 --> 01:24:41,786
What are you up to now?

706
01:24:41,911 --> 01:24:44,581
All right, that's enough.
Back to your room.

707
01:24:52,255 --> 01:24:54,299
Oh dear, that was careless...

708
01:24:54,841 --> 01:24:56,175
Haku, no!

709
01:25:17,572 --> 01:25:18,781
Haku!

710
01:25:46,768 --> 01:25:48,394
What is this?

711
01:25:48,519 --> 01:25:49,979
Hold on there!

712
01:25:52,940 --> 01:25:54,233
Haku!

713
01:25:57,695 --> 01:25:59,280
Does it hurt?

714
01:26:02,909 --> 01:26:05,036
This is serious.

715
01:26:07,121 --> 01:26:08,289
Haku, don't give up.

716
01:26:08,414 --> 01:26:10,208
What can we do? He'll die!

717
01:26:10,708 --> 01:26:13,419
Something inside him
is eating him up.

718
01:26:13,544 --> 01:26:14,629
Inside him?

719
01:26:14,754 --> 01:26:18,091
It's a strong spell.
There's nothing I can do.

720
01:26:18,383 --> 01:26:21,678
Haku, the river guardian gave me this.

721
01:26:21,803 --> 01:26:23,971
Eat it, maybe it will help.

722
01:26:26,224 --> 01:26:28,476
Haku, open your mouth.

723
01:26:28,726 --> 01:26:31,312
Please Haku, eat it.

724
01:26:33,064 --> 01:26:34,857
See, it's safe.

725
01:26:35,149 --> 01:26:37,235
Is it some kind of medicine?

726
01:26:37,485 --> 01:26:40,530
Open your mouth.
You can do it.

727
01:26:44,325 --> 01:26:46,077
That's it.

728
01:26:46,202 --> 01:26:47,620
Swallow it.

729
01:27:06,013 --> 01:27:07,390
He spit something out.
That's it!

730
01:27:20,111 --> 01:27:21,320
The seal!

731
01:27:21,487 --> 01:27:23,322
It's getting away.
There! Over there!

732
01:27:43,050 --> 01:27:45,720
Sen, we have to purge the spell.

733
01:27:49,891 --> 01:27:50,808
Begone!

734
01:27:50,933 --> 01:27:53,728
Haku took this from Yubaba's sister.

735
01:27:54,061 --> 01:27:56,731
From Zeniba? That's a witch's seal.

736
01:27:57,148 --> 01:27:59,275
Precious loot, I'd say.

737
01:28:02,779 --> 01:28:03,780
I knew it was Haku.

738
01:28:03,905 --> 01:28:05,490
Kamaji, it's Haku!

739
01:28:07,700 --> 01:28:08,659
Haku!

740
01:28:08,826 --> 01:28:10,328
Haku, Haku!

741
01:28:12,663 --> 01:28:14,624
Kamaji, he's not breathing.

742
01:28:14,749 --> 01:28:18,336
He is, but he's still
very ill from the spell.

743
01:28:27,595 --> 01:28:30,598
That should calm him some.

744
01:28:33,017 --> 01:28:37,897
Haku turned up one day,
just like you.

745
01:28:38,022 --> 01:28:40,858
He said he wanted to learn magic.

746
01:28:41,150 --> 01:28:43,152
I tried to warn him.

747
01:28:43,277 --> 01:28:46,948
Becoming a sorcerer's apprentice
is dangerous business.

748
01:28:47,448 --> 01:28:49,867
But he wouldn't listen.
He kept saying...

749
01:28:50,117 --> 01:28:51,744
that he'd lost his home.

750
01:28:51,869 --> 01:28:55,414
So he signed up to be
Yubaba's apprentice.

751
01:28:55,873 --> 01:28:59,001
He got paler and paler
as time went by...

752
01:28:59,126 --> 01:29:02,046
and got a sharp
gleam in his eye.

753
01:29:04,090 --> 01:29:08,094
Kamaji, I'm going to give
this back to Zeniba.

754
01:29:08,219 --> 01:29:11,931
Give it back, apologize,
and ask her to help Haku.

755
01:29:12,056 --> 01:29:13,975
Tell me how to get there.

756
01:29:14,392 --> 01:29:16,727
To Zeniba's house?

757
01:29:17,144 --> 01:29:19,063
That's one scary sorceress.

758
01:29:19,188 --> 01:29:19,981
Please.

759
01:29:20,231 --> 01:29:24,235
Haku helped me.
Now I want to help him.

760
01:29:25,945 --> 01:29:29,073
Well, getting there is one thing.

761
01:29:29,240 --> 01:29:31,158
Getting back's the problem.

762
01:29:31,492 --> 01:29:33,244
Wait a minute.

763
01:29:35,663 --> 01:29:39,000
Let's see now,
they're here somewhere...

764
01:29:39,667 --> 01:29:42,753
Everyone, I need
my shoes and clothes.

765
01:29:51,095 --> 01:29:54,098
Sen! I've been hunting
for you everywhere!

766
01:29:56,642 --> 01:29:57,768
Lin...

767
01:29:57,894 --> 01:30:00,563
Haku? What happened here?

768
01:30:01,272 --> 01:30:02,273
Who are those guys?

769
01:30:03,357 --> 01:30:04,817
My new friends.

770
01:30:04,942 --> 01:30:05,651
Right?

771
01:30:05,902 --> 01:30:09,071
Yubaba's looking for you.
She's hopping mad.

772
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:12,909
That big tipper turned out
to be a No Face.

773
01:30:13,367 --> 01:30:15,786
Yubaba says you let him in.

774
01:30:19,206 --> 01:30:20,458
She might be right.

775
01:30:20,583 --> 01:30:22,627
What, are you serious?

776
01:30:22,793 --> 01:30:24,420
I thought he was a customer.

777
01:30:24,545 --> 01:30:27,715
He's already swallowed
three of our people!

778
01:30:28,132 --> 01:30:31,135
Found them.
Here they are, Sen.

779
01:30:31,552 --> 01:30:33,179
We're busy, gramps.

780
01:30:33,304 --> 01:30:34,889
You can use these.

781
01:30:36,307 --> 01:30:39,101
Train tickets?
Where'd you get those?

782
01:30:39,226 --> 01:30:41,687
Leftovers from 40 years ago.

783
01:30:41,812 --> 01:30:45,566
You get off at the sixth stop,
called Swamp Bottom.

784
01:30:45,816 --> 01:30:46,901
Swamp Bottom?

785
01:30:47,026 --> 01:30:48,945
That's right, the sixth stop.

786
01:30:49,070 --> 01:30:50,071
Six.

787
01:30:50,446 --> 01:30:54,033
Make sure you get it right.
There used to be a return train...

788
01:30:54,158 --> 01:30:55,993
but these days it's one way only.

789
01:30:56,160 --> 01:30:57,828
Still want to go?

790
01:30:57,954 --> 01:31:01,165
Yes, I'll walk back along the tracks.

791
01:31:02,875 --> 01:31:04,627
What about Yubaba?

792
01:31:04,752 --> 01:31:06,003
I'll talk to her now.

793
01:31:06,837 --> 01:31:10,633
Haku, I promise I'll be back.
Please don't die.

794
01:31:11,258 --> 01:31:12,927
What's going on here?

795
01:31:13,511 --> 01:31:15,972
Don't you understand? It's love.

796
01:31:23,854 --> 01:31:26,190
It just keeps getting bigger!

797
01:31:26,357 --> 01:31:28,985
- Don't let it eat me!
- Here she comes.

798
01:31:36,534 --> 01:31:37,994
Thank goodness, Sen!

799
01:31:38,119 --> 01:31:40,329
Yubaba can't control him.

800
01:31:43,541 --> 01:31:47,378
There's no need to get upset.
Sen will be here soon.

801
01:31:47,795 --> 01:31:50,297
Where's Sen? I want Sen!

802
01:31:50,631 --> 01:31:52,258
Now hurry!

803
01:31:57,596 --> 01:31:59,515
Yubaba, it's Sen.

804
01:31:59,640 --> 01:32:01,017
Where were you?

805
01:32:01,142 --> 01:32:05,563
Sen is here, honored guest.
She'll be right with you.

806
01:32:06,605 --> 01:32:09,734
What took you so long?
This is a total disaster!

807
01:32:09,900 --> 01:32:12,737
Win him over
and take all his gold.

808
01:32:16,615 --> 01:32:18,951
What's this filthy rat?

809
01:32:20,786 --> 01:32:23,164
Don't you recognize him?

810
01:32:23,414 --> 01:32:26,167
Of course not.
How disgusting.

811
01:32:26,375 --> 01:32:27,752
Now in you go.

812
01:32:29,253 --> 01:32:31,505
Have a nice time.

813
01:32:32,423 --> 01:32:34,675
Will she be all right?

814
01:32:34,925 --> 01:32:36,761
Want to take her place?

815
01:32:57,281 --> 01:33:00,451
Try this, it's yummy.

816
01:33:02,328 --> 01:33:06,832
Want some gold?
I've decided it's just for you.

817
01:33:10,836 --> 01:33:12,588
Come over here.

818
01:33:12,713 --> 01:33:16,342
What do you want?
You can tell me.

819
01:33:16,675 --> 01:33:18,594
Where did you come from?

820
01:33:18,719 --> 01:33:21,097
There's someplace
I have to go right away.

821
01:33:23,474 --> 01:33:25,935
You should go home.

822
01:33:26,143 --> 01:33:29,105
You can't give me what I want.

823
01:33:30,981 --> 01:33:33,984
Where's your home?
You must have a mom and dad.

824
01:33:34,819 --> 01:33:38,114
No... No...

825
01:33:39,073 --> 01:33:42,827
I'm lonely... So lonely...

826
01:33:43,661 --> 01:33:45,162
Are you lost?

827
01:33:45,538 --> 01:33:49,083
Sen... I want Sen.

828
01:33:49,708 --> 01:33:50,835
Take the gold.

829
01:33:51,377 --> 01:33:52,503
Would you eat me?

830
01:33:52,670 --> 01:33:53,462
Take it.

831
01:33:53,587 --> 01:33:54,463
Take it!

832
01:34:03,722 --> 01:34:06,433
Before you eat me, eat this first.

833
01:34:07,226 --> 01:34:11,063
I was saving it for my parents,
but you can have it.

834
01:34:31,876 --> 01:34:33,294
Sen!

835
01:34:35,754 --> 01:34:39,508
You little wench!
What did you feed me?

836
01:34:54,773 --> 01:34:56,108
Watch out!

837
01:34:57,276 --> 01:34:59,111
Not in my house!

838
01:35:12,541 --> 01:35:13,959
I'm over here!

839
01:35:14,752 --> 01:35:16,086
Here!

840
01:36:00,839 --> 01:36:02,508
You'll pay for this!

841
01:36:19,984 --> 01:36:22,027
Sen, down here!

842
01:36:38,377 --> 01:36:40,629
Over here!

843
01:36:40,754 --> 01:36:42,423
We don't need him.

844
01:36:46,427 --> 01:36:49,930
He needs to get out of there.
It's bad for him.

845
01:36:50,055 --> 01:36:52,182
But where do we take him?

846
01:36:52,349 --> 01:36:53,309
I don't know.

847
01:36:53,434 --> 01:36:54,852
Don't know?

848
01:36:55,311 --> 01:36:57,938
Great, now he's following us.

849
01:37:15,456 --> 01:37:17,541
- From here you walk.
- Okay.

850
01:37:17,666 --> 01:37:19,376
You'll find the station.

851
01:37:19,543 --> 01:37:20,961
Thanks.

852
01:37:21,587 --> 01:37:23,213
Be sure to come back!

853
01:37:23,422 --> 01:37:24,423
I will.

854
01:37:28,594 --> 01:37:32,056
Sen! I said you were a klutz.

855
01:37:32,222 --> 01:37:33,724
I take it back!

856
01:37:41,940 --> 01:37:46,111
No Face, hurt her
and you'll get it from me!

857
01:37:49,406 --> 01:37:50,741
There it is.

858
01:38:02,294 --> 01:38:04,671
The train's coming, let's hurry.

859
01:38:28,153 --> 01:38:30,406
To Swamp Bottom, please.

860
01:38:36,995 --> 01:38:38,664
You want to come too?

861
01:38:40,165 --> 01:38:42,167
One more, please.

862
01:39:22,708 --> 01:39:24,042
Sit down.

863
01:39:24,668 --> 01:39:26,336
Behave yourself, okay?

864
01:41:28,500 --> 01:41:29,960
Kamaji.

865
01:41:32,337 --> 01:41:34,923
Oh, Haku.
You're awake.

866
01:41:35,048 --> 01:41:36,592
Kamaji, where's Sen?

867
01:41:37,009 --> 01:41:39,595
What happened? Please tell me.

868
01:41:39,845 --> 01:41:42,723
Don't you remember anything?

869
01:41:43,307 --> 01:41:45,392
Just fragments.

870
01:41:45,601 --> 01:41:48,687
Chihiro kept calling my name
in the darkness.

871
01:41:48,979 --> 01:41:52,983
I followed her voice
and woke up here.

872
01:41:53,358 --> 01:41:58,238
Chihiro?
So her name is Chihiro.

873
01:41:59,489 --> 01:42:02,367
Wonderful... It's the power of love.

874
01:42:06,038 --> 01:42:09,124
This gold will hardly cover the damage.

875
01:42:09,249 --> 01:42:12,169
That fool, Sen!
She just cost me a fortune.

876
01:42:12,669 --> 01:42:16,340
But we were saved, thanks to her.

877
01:42:16,506 --> 01:42:17,633
Silence!

878
01:42:17,758 --> 01:42:20,177
She started the whole thing.

879
01:42:20,302 --> 01:42:22,596
Now she's run away.

880
01:42:22,721 --> 01:42:25,390
Abandoned her own parents!

881
01:42:26,058 --> 01:42:29,895
They must be fat enough.
Turn them into bacon or ham.

882
01:42:30,228 --> 01:42:31,855
No, wait.

883
01:42:33,023 --> 01:42:34,149
Master Haku!

884
01:42:34,274 --> 01:42:36,526
What, you're still alive?

885
01:42:38,904 --> 01:42:42,282
You still don't see it?
She's played a trick on you.

886
01:42:42,741 --> 01:42:45,535
You've gotten pretty fresh.

887
01:42:45,702 --> 01:42:48,163
Since when do you talk that way?

888
01:43:39,798 --> 01:43:41,758
Bo?

889
01:43:47,764 --> 01:43:49,391
Bo!

890
01:43:49,516 --> 01:43:50,517
Pebbles!

891
01:43:50,642 --> 01:43:53,437
Bo!

892
01:43:53,937 --> 01:43:57,774
Where are you, Bo?

893
01:43:58,108 --> 01:44:00,736
Please come out.

894
01:44:01,445 --> 01:44:02,738
Bo!

895
01:44:05,991 --> 01:44:08,285
Bo?

896
01:44:13,123 --> 01:44:17,461
Why, you little...

897
01:44:18,920 --> 01:44:22,048
Out with it!

898
01:44:23,508 --> 01:44:27,637
Where did you hide my Bo?

899
01:44:28,138 --> 01:44:29,931
He's with Zeniba.

900
01:44:30,056 --> 01:44:32,017
Zeniba?

901
01:44:53,038 --> 01:44:56,708
Now I understand.
That evil witch.

902
01:44:56,833 --> 01:44:59,544
She thinks she's beaten me.

903
01:45:01,213 --> 01:45:03,465
So, what's your plan?

904
01:45:03,965 --> 01:45:06,009
I'll bring him back.

905
01:45:06,176 --> 01:45:10,388
But you must send Sen and
her parents back to their world.

906
01:45:10,555 --> 01:45:12,974
And what about you?

907
01:45:13,225 --> 01:45:16,978
Maybe I'll send them back
and then tear you to pieces.

908
01:46:03,942 --> 01:46:05,569
I think this is right.

909
01:46:06,736 --> 01:46:08,029
Come on.

910
01:46:34,848 --> 01:46:36,516
You can ride on my shoulder.

911
01:47:55,178 --> 01:47:56,596
Come in.

912
01:48:01,768 --> 01:48:03,561
Thank you.

913
01:48:05,522 --> 01:48:07,941
Well, hurry up then.

914
01:48:08,441 --> 01:48:09,734
Come on.

915
01:48:13,029 --> 01:48:14,864
So you all made it.

916
01:48:14,990 --> 01:48:17,409
- I...
- Have a seat.

917
01:48:17,534 --> 01:48:19,786
I'll make some tea.

918
01:48:25,625 --> 01:48:29,879
Zeniba, Haku stole this.
I came to give it back.

919
01:48:33,133 --> 01:48:35,593
Do you know what this is?

920
01:48:35,885 --> 01:48:38,805
No, but I know it's very precious.

921
01:48:38,930 --> 01:48:42,559
I'm here to apologize for him.
He's sorry.

922
01:48:43,435 --> 01:48:46,479
You held this
and nothing happened to you?

923
01:48:46,604 --> 01:48:47,522
What?

924
01:48:47,647 --> 01:48:50,442
Wait, the protection spell is gone.

925
01:48:51,568 --> 01:48:54,738
I'm sorry.
There was this strange bug.

926
01:48:54,863 --> 01:48:56,698
I squashed it.

927
01:48:57,240 --> 01:48:59,367
Squashed it!

928
01:49:01,411 --> 01:49:04,748
My sister snuck
that bug into the dragon...

929
01:49:04,873 --> 01:49:07,542
so she could control him.

930
01:49:07,667 --> 01:49:10,295
And you squashed it!

931
01:49:13,089 --> 01:49:14,632
Now then, sit down.

932
01:49:14,799 --> 01:49:17,802
You must be No Face.
You sit, too.

933
01:49:18,762 --> 01:49:22,432
Please turn them back into themselves.

934
01:49:22,557 --> 01:49:25,602
Why my dear, the spell's long broken.

935
01:49:25,769 --> 01:49:28,146
They can change back any time.

936
01:49:35,445 --> 01:49:39,282
Yubaba and I are two halves of
a whole, but we don't get along.

937
01:49:39,407 --> 01:49:41,951
You know what bad taste she has.

938
01:49:42,118 --> 01:49:45,163
Sorceress twins are
just a recipe for trouble.

939
01:49:49,209 --> 01:49:53,671
I'd like to help you dear,
but there's nothing I can do.

940
01:49:53,797 --> 01:49:55,840
It's one of our rules here.

941
01:49:56,299 --> 01:49:59,302
You'll have to save your parents
and your dragon boyfriend...

942
01:49:59,427 --> 01:50:01,054
all by yourself.

943
01:50:01,179 --> 01:50:04,099
But can't you
even give me a hint?

944
01:50:04,474 --> 01:50:07,936
I feel like Haku and I met
a long time ago.

945
01:50:08,103 --> 01:50:10,105
In that case it's easy.

946
01:50:10,396 --> 01:50:12,941
Everything that happens
stays inside you...

947
01:50:13,066 --> 01:50:15,318
even if you can't remember it.

948
01:50:16,653 --> 01:50:19,989
It's already late.
Why don't you stay the night?

949
01:50:20,406 --> 01:50:23,201
You boys give me a hand.

950
01:50:29,332 --> 01:50:31,334
Come on, keep at it.

951
01:50:34,337 --> 01:50:36,840
See? You have a talent for this.

952
01:50:37,006 --> 01:50:38,633
You're a big help.

953
01:50:39,425 --> 01:50:42,679
It's not the same
when you use magic.

954
01:50:44,013 --> 01:50:48,351
Pull it through there.
Now do it again.

955
01:50:48,560 --> 01:50:51,187
Zeniba, I'm going back after all.

956
01:50:51,855 --> 01:50:55,316
Haku could die while I'm sitting here.

957
01:50:55,525 --> 01:50:59,028
And they might eat
my mom and dad!

958
01:51:01,197 --> 01:51:03,950
Wait just a little longer.

959
01:51:04,075 --> 01:51:05,618
There we are.

960
01:51:06,452 --> 01:51:08,413
Use it to tie back your hair.

961
01:51:13,751 --> 01:51:14,502
It's pretty.

962
01:51:14,711 --> 01:51:19,632
It'll protect you.
I made it from the thread we spun.

963
01:51:19,883 --> 01:51:21,176
Thank you.

964
01:51:30,727 --> 01:51:34,522
What good timing.
We've got another guest, let him in.

965
01:51:34,647 --> 01:51:35,773
Sure.

966
01:51:49,078 --> 01:51:50,205
Haku!

967
01:51:51,414 --> 01:51:52,582
Haku...

968
01:51:53,416 --> 01:51:55,001
I'm so glad to see you.

969
01:51:55,335 --> 01:51:57,795
Are you okay?
Do you feel all right?

970
01:51:58,087 --> 01:51:59,088
Thank goodness.

971
01:52:00,924 --> 01:52:03,176
Good timing, I'd say.

972
01:52:03,843 --> 01:52:06,304
Zeniba, Haku's alive.

973
01:52:06,846 --> 01:52:10,975
Haku, I no longer blame
you for what you did.

974
01:52:11,100 --> 01:52:14,479
But be sure to protect this girl.

975
01:52:14,771 --> 01:52:17,774
Okay boys, time you went home.

976
01:52:17,899 --> 01:52:19,943
Come see me again soon.

977
01:52:20,693 --> 01:52:25,031
You stay with me
and be my helper.

978
01:52:27,533 --> 01:52:28,493
Zeniba!

979
01:52:29,118 --> 01:52:31,287
Thank you, I'm going now.

980
01:52:31,412 --> 01:52:34,457
Don't worry, I'm sure
you'll manage just fine.

981
01:52:34,624 --> 01:52:37,835
My real name is Chihiro.

982
01:52:37,961 --> 01:52:40,463
Chihiro? What a nice name.

983
01:52:40,588 --> 01:52:42,465
Take good care of it.

984
01:52:42,590 --> 01:52:43,258
I will!

985
01:52:43,383 --> 01:52:45,176
Now off you go.

986
01:52:46,886 --> 01:52:49,973
Thank you, Zeniba.
Goodbye!

987
01:53:39,022 --> 01:53:40,523
Haku, listen.

988
01:53:40,857 --> 01:53:44,485
I don't remember this,
but my mom told me about it.

989
01:53:44,861 --> 01:53:48,489
Once when I was little,
I fell in a river.

990
01:53:48,948 --> 01:53:52,577
Now it's all built over.
It flows underground.

991
01:53:52,952 --> 01:53:55,079
But I just remembered.

992
01:53:56,205 --> 01:53:57,874
The river was called...

993
01:53:58,541 --> 01:54:01,419
it was called the Kohaku River.

994
01:54:02,045 --> 01:54:05,048
Your real name is Kohaku.

995
01:54:26,652 --> 01:54:28,112
Chihiro, thank you!

996
01:54:28,237 --> 01:54:31,491
My name is
Nigihayami Kohaku Nushi.

997
01:54:31,908 --> 01:54:35,119
- Nigihayami?
- Nigihayami Kohaku Nushi.

998
01:54:35,286 --> 01:54:37,997
What a name!
Sounds like a guardian spirit.

999
01:54:38,331 --> 01:54:42,752
I remember how
you fell into me as a child.

1000
01:54:42,877 --> 01:54:44,587
You were chasing your shoe.

1001
01:54:44,796 --> 01:54:49,133
Yes, and you carried me
to shallow water.

1002
01:54:50,009 --> 01:54:51,260
I'm so happy...

1003
01:55:24,043 --> 01:55:25,461
They're back!

1004
01:55:38,808 --> 01:55:41,436
You brought Bo back with you?

1005
01:55:44,313 --> 01:55:45,231
Baba!

1006
01:55:45,356 --> 01:55:49,777
Bo! You're not hurt?
What a terrible time you had.

1007
01:55:51,028 --> 01:55:54,157
Bo, when did you learn
to stand on your own?

1008
01:55:54,740 --> 01:55:56,659
Yubaba, remember your promise.

1009
01:55:56,909 --> 01:55:59,912
Send Chihiro and her parents
back to their world.

1010
01:56:00,329 --> 01:56:02,748
Sorry, but it's not that simple.

1011
01:56:02,874 --> 01:56:06,002
This world has rules, you know.

1012
01:56:06,627 --> 01:56:07,795
Silence!

1013
01:56:07,920 --> 01:56:10,548
Just do it, Baba.
Don't be so mean.

1014
01:56:10,840 --> 01:56:13,426
Baby had such a good time.

1015
01:56:13,926 --> 01:56:16,679
But I'm just following the rule.

1016
01:56:16,804 --> 01:56:19,182
Otherwise I can't break the spell.

1017
01:56:19,432 --> 01:56:22,560
If you make Sen cry,
I won't like you anymore.

1018
01:56:22,852 --> 01:56:24,187
But...

1019
01:56:24,312 --> 01:56:25,480
Granny!

1020
01:56:25,688 --> 01:56:27,064
Granny?

1021
01:56:27,398 --> 01:56:29,025
I'll do as you ask.

1022
01:56:40,870 --> 01:56:42,997
Haku told me about the rule.

1023
01:56:43,122 --> 01:56:44,916
Well, you've got guts.

1024
01:56:45,124 --> 01:56:48,377
I brought your contract.
Follow me.

1025
01:56:48,544 --> 01:56:50,588
This won't take a minute, Bo.

1026
01:56:51,589 --> 01:56:53,090
Don't worry.

1027
01:56:57,553 --> 01:57:01,390
See if you can pick out
your parents for me.

1028
01:57:10,733 --> 01:57:12,151
You get one guess.

1029
01:57:12,276 --> 01:57:14,946
Pick them out
and you all go free.

1030
01:57:26,791 --> 01:57:30,461
Granny, I can't do it.
Dad and Mom aren't here.

1031
01:57:30,628 --> 01:57:34,215
Not here?
Is that your answer?

1032
01:57:35,758 --> 01:57:36,801
Yes.

1033
01:57:39,595 --> 01:57:42,890
You're right!

1034
01:57:43,057 --> 01:57:45,518
Attagirl! Good for you.

1035
01:57:49,480 --> 01:57:50,648
Thank you everyone.

1036
01:57:50,773 --> 01:57:54,026
All right!
You win, just get out of here.

1037
01:57:54,527 --> 01:57:56,445
Thanks for everything.

1038
01:57:56,988 --> 01:57:58,489
Goodbye.

1039
01:57:58,948 --> 01:57:59,949
Thank you.

1040
01:58:00,116 --> 01:58:01,492
See you soon.

1041
01:58:01,784 --> 01:58:03,536
- Haku!
- Let's go.

1042
01:58:04,203 --> 01:58:05,413
Where's Mom and Dad?

1043
01:58:05,538 --> 01:58:06,831
They went on ahead.

1044
01:58:14,380 --> 01:58:15,464
The water's gone.

1045
01:58:15,631 --> 01:58:17,383
I can't go any further.

1046
01:58:17,800 --> 01:58:20,136
Go back the way you came.

1047
01:58:20,303 --> 01:58:23,389
But don't look back
until you're out of the tunnel.

1048
01:58:23,556 --> 01:58:25,641
But what about you?

1049
01:58:26,058 --> 01:58:28,811
I'll tell Yubaba
I'm quitting my apprenticeship.

1050
01:58:28,978 --> 01:58:31,522
I'm fine now.
I have my name back.

1051
01:58:32,064 --> 01:58:33,858
Now I can go home too.

1052
01:58:33,983 --> 01:58:35,318
Will we meet again somewhere?

1053
01:58:35,484 --> 01:58:36,986
- I'm sure of it.
- Promise?

1054
01:58:37,111 --> 01:58:37,945
Promise.

1055
01:58:38,070 --> 01:58:40,364
Now go, and don't look back.

1056
01:59:03,429 --> 01:59:05,014
Chihiro!

1057
01:59:05,348 --> 01:59:08,017
Where have you been?
Hurry up.

1058
01:59:11,520 --> 01:59:13,356
Mom! Dad!

1059
01:59:13,481 --> 01:59:15,191
Don't go running off like that.

1060
01:59:15,358 --> 01:59:16,359
Let's go.

1061
01:59:17,026 --> 01:59:19,236
Mom, are you really okay?

1062
01:59:19,362 --> 01:59:23,616
Hurry, the moving van
will be there.

1063
01:59:33,042 --> 01:59:35,252
Hurry up, Chihiro.

1064
01:59:43,969 --> 01:59:45,721
Watch your step.

1065
01:59:45,846 --> 01:59:49,183
Chihiro, don't cling.
You'll make me trip.

1066
02:00:01,404 --> 02:00:02,863
The end of the tunnel.

1067
02:00:03,239 --> 02:00:04,490
Hey!

1068
02:00:04,824 --> 02:00:06,200
What is it?

1069
02:00:06,784 --> 02:00:08,911
Will you look at that.

1070
02:00:09,995 --> 02:00:12,164
It's all dusty inside, too.

1071
02:00:12,581 --> 02:00:14,500
- Is this somebody's joke?
- I wonder...

1072
02:00:14,625 --> 02:00:17,044
I told you not to stop here.

1073
02:00:22,758 --> 02:00:25,261
That's it, you're fine.

1074
02:00:26,512 --> 02:00:28,764
We're off, Chihiro.

1075
02:00:28,889 --> 02:00:31,600
Chihiro! Hurry up!
