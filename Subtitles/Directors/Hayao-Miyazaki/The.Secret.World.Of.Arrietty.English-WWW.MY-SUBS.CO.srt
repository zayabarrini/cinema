THE SECRET WORLD
OF ARRIETTY

13
00:01:31,334 --> 00:01:34,876
Haru...how many times
have I told her?

14
00:01:36,084 --> 00:01:38,334
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

15
00:01:44,334 --> 00:01:48,668
Haru! You're blocking
the driveway again.

16
00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:17,709
Sho?

17
00:03:17,834 --> 00:03:19,959
Where are you?

18
00:04:35,418 --> 00:04:36,876
Don't touch!

19
00:04:38,834 --> 00:04:40,793
These aren't for you.

20
00:05:02,126 --> 00:05:04,168
- Arrietty!
- What?

21
00:05:05,043 --> 00:05:07,168
You went outside again, didn't you?

22
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:10,834
And you might clean up
this room, young lady.

23
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:12,668
It's my own little garden.

24
00:05:13,251 --> 00:05:16,459
If you ask me,
it looks like a mess.

25
00:05:18,168 --> 00:05:19,959
Oh! Is that a bay leaf?

26
00:05:25,334 --> 00:05:30,126
Oh, well, I guess this means
your birthday comes early.

27
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:37,168
Enough for a whole year.

28
00:05:37,918 --> 00:05:40,876
But the bay tree's so far away.

29
00:05:41,001 --> 00:05:43,126
If a human bean saw you...

30
00:05:43,251 --> 00:05:44,834
I'm always careful.

31
00:05:45,584 --> 00:05:48,793
The world is full
of dangerous creatures.

32
00:05:50,668 --> 00:05:52,084
Your great uncle...

33
00:05:52,209 --> 00:05:54,834
...was eaten by a frog. Right?

34
00:05:55,543 --> 00:05:57,876
Doesn't that sh/so smell lovely?

35
00:05:58,334 --> 00:05:59,793
Yes, it does.

36
00:06:00,751 --> 00:06:03,918
With a bit of sugar,
I could make sh/so juice.

37
00:06:07,334 --> 00:06:10,001
Wait till tonight.
I'll borrow some for you.

38
00:06:11,834 --> 00:06:16,001
My first borrowing ever!
I've been practising night and day.

39
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:18,168
Papa's home.

40
00:06:23,876 --> 00:06:25,501
Welcome back.

41
00:06:28,168 --> 00:06:31,793
- Papa, about tonight...
- There's a boy in the house.

42
00:06:33,084 --> 00:06:34,668
I saw him.

43
00:06:34,793 --> 00:06:38,043
- No! Arrietty...
- He didn't see me!

44
00:06:38,168 --> 00:06:43,126
I hid behind the bay leaf.
Papa, we're still going, aren't we?

45
00:06:43,251 --> 00:06:45,834
I won't hear of it.
It's too dangerous.

46
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:48,168
But he's just a child!

47
00:06:48,293 --> 00:06:52,293
Papa, I've been waiting
for such a long time.

48
00:06:52,418 --> 00:06:55,334
The children can be more savage
than the grownups.

49
00:06:55,793 --> 00:06:57,251
I'll be fine!

50
00:07:01,334 --> 00:07:03,543
Youngsters go to bed early.

51
00:07:04,459 --> 00:07:06,084
Thank you, Papa!

52
00:07:06,584 --> 00:07:07,793
But Pod...

53
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:11,209
The boy's sick.
Don't worry, we'll be fine.

54
00:07:11,334 --> 00:07:13,043
But Still...

55
00:07:13,793 --> 00:07:17,084
Stop worrying, Mother.
We'll be extra careful.

56
00:07:20,251 --> 00:07:22,834
Arrietty will be 14 soon.

57
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:26,959
Someday she'll have to survive
without our help.

58
00:07:27,084 --> 00:07:31,418
Sometimes I think
we're the last Borrowers in the world.

59
00:07:56,918 --> 00:08:00,376
Whatever you need,
just ask Haru.

60
00:08:00,501 --> 00:08:01,959
All right.

61
00:08:02,084 --> 00:08:03,793
Haru, I'm depending on you.

62
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:05,709
Yes, ma'am.

63
00:08:12,668 --> 00:08:16,043
Let's shut the screen.
Keep the bugs out.

64
00:09:01,918 --> 00:09:04,501
Shouldn't you wear something darker?

65
00:09:04,626 --> 00:09:06,584
I already decided!

66
00:09:09,793 --> 00:09:12,626
I hope you can borrow
some tissue paper.

67
00:09:12,751 --> 00:09:15,084
And a bit of sugar, perhaps?

68
00:09:15,209 --> 00:09:19,376
We could have sh/so juice
and sugar for the tea.

69
00:09:22,334 --> 00:09:23,918
But anything's just fine.

70
00:09:26,834 --> 00:09:28,751
We'll be back soon.

71
00:09:29,501 --> 00:09:32,043
- Please be careful.
- We will.

72
00:10:03,584 --> 00:10:05,043
Arrietty!

73
00:10:23,751 --> 00:10:25,168
Sorry!

74
00:11:04,793 --> 00:11:07,834
- Hold these for me.
- Okay.

75
00:11:42,293 --> 00:11:43,751
Hold on tight!

76
00:12:29,584 --> 00:12:31,001
Arrietty?

77
00:12:31,126 --> 00:12:32,209
Ready?

78
00:13:57,459 --> 00:13:59,751
Everything's so huge.

79
00:14:00,334 --> 00:14:02,543
The world of human beans.

80
00:14:02,668 --> 00:14:04,543
The sugar's over there.

81
00:14:09,459 --> 00:14:11,168
Wait for me down there.

82
00:14:57,751 --> 00:14:59,543
Papa, you're great.

83
00:16:23,918 --> 00:16:25,334
Now, let's get that tissue.

84
00:16:45,793 --> 00:16:47,376
Papa, look.

85
00:16:49,168 --> 00:16:51,209
Your first borrowing.

86
00:16:51,751 --> 00:16:53,793
Be careful, it's sharp.

87
00:16:53,918 --> 00:16:55,043
I Will!

88
00:17:16,751 --> 00:17:18,751
Papa, borrowing is such fun!

89
00:17:24,459 --> 00:17:25,918
Look down there.

90
00:17:31,793 --> 00:17:35,168
Rats. Steer clear of them.
They're trouble.

91
00:17:35,834 --> 00:17:36,959
I'm not afraid.

92
00:17:39,043 --> 00:17:41,626
I'm ready for anything.
I've got this!

93
00:17:42,751 --> 00:17:45,834
Sometimes it's best not
to go looking for danger.

94
00:18:32,459 --> 00:18:33,751
What is this place?

95
00:18:34,418 --> 00:18:37,709
Human beans made it
for their dolls.

96
00:18:46,084 --> 00:18:48,418
It's just perfect for us!

97
00:18:49,126 --> 00:18:52,793
I'm sure Mother would love
that dresser over there.

98
00:18:52,918 --> 00:18:54,709
These things aren't for borrowing.

99
00:18:54,834 --> 00:18:57,918
If anything went missing,
they'd know right away.

100
00:18:58,834 --> 00:18:59,918
Oh...

101
00:21:20,418 --> 00:21:22,084
Don't be afraid.

102
00:21:41,626 --> 00:21:47,626
I saw you. In the garden.
It was you, wasn't it?

103
00:21:54,168 --> 00:21:56,918
My mother told me about you.

104
00:21:57,751 --> 00:22:01,751
She saw little people here
when she was young.

105
00:22:03,584 --> 00:22:06,251
Was it you that she saw?

106
00:22:08,876 --> 00:22:10,043
Was it?

107
00:22:56,501 --> 00:22:58,418
I'm sorry, Papa.

108
00:22:58,918 --> 00:23:01,251
He saw me today,
out in the garden.

109
00:23:02,751 --> 00:23:05,251
I should've been more careful.

110
00:23:05,918 --> 00:23:08,293
I hope he didn't frighten you.

111
00:23:08,418 --> 00:23:13,334
Best not tell your mother,
it will only worry her.

112
00:23:13,459 --> 00:23:14,584
All right.

113
00:23:20,001 --> 00:23:25,584
You don't always have to run.
Observe them first, then decide.

114
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:40,918
We're home.

115
00:23:41,459 --> 00:23:42,834
Safe and sound.

116
00:23:54,626 --> 00:23:55,751
And...?

117
00:23:57,418 --> 00:23:59,209
Things didn't go well this time.

118
00:23:59,334 --> 00:24:02,543
This light gave out
before we finished.

119
00:24:03,501 --> 00:24:04,709
Oh dear.

120
00:24:05,834 --> 00:24:08,418
We had to give up
on the sugar.

121
00:24:08,876 --> 00:24:12,418
Don't give it a thought.
At least you're safe and sound.

122
00:24:13,459 --> 00:24:17,876
Arrietty, you found something.
Show your mother your first borrowing.

123
00:24:27,043 --> 00:24:28,793
What a pretty pin.

124
00:24:32,418 --> 00:24:33,918
Time for bed.

125
00:24:41,126 --> 00:24:42,584
Good night.

126
00:24:47,626 --> 00:24:50,084
She looks worn out.

127
00:24:51,043 --> 00:24:52,751
Shall I make some tea?

128
00:27:25,918 --> 00:27:27,501
She!

129
00:27:27,626 --> 00:27:30,584
Come in the house.
You'll catch cold out there.

130
00:28:14,251 --> 00:28:16,834
A cube of sugar?
But whatever for?

131
00:28:17,793 --> 00:28:19,751
He left it by the grating.

132
00:28:20,209 --> 00:28:23,251
It's probably the same one
I dropped last night.

133
00:28:24,793 --> 00:28:25,918
What?

134
00:28:26,459 --> 00:28:28,751
What do you mean,
you dropped it?

135
00:28:33,418 --> 00:28:35,918
Don't touch it.
Do you understand?

136
00:28:39,543 --> 00:28:40,918
It's a trap.

137
00:28:41,751 --> 00:28:44,293
They're trying to catch us!

138
00:28:44,918 --> 00:28:48,334
We'll have to stop borrowing
for a while.

139
00:28:48,459 --> 00:28:50,959
Maybe they already know
where we are.

140
00:28:51,084 --> 00:28:52,918
Pod, we'll have to move!

141
00:28:54,376 --> 00:28:57,793
This was such a lovely house.

142
00:28:57,918 --> 00:29:00,084
Now we'll have to start
all over again.

143
00:29:02,293 --> 00:29:05,043
Well, let's see how things go.

144
00:29:05,168 --> 00:29:07,251
Now eat, soup's getting cold.

145
00:29:09,043 --> 00:29:11,418
Why did it have to be sugar?

146
00:29:33,126 --> 00:29:34,793
Thank you, Arrietty.

147
00:29:34,918 --> 00:29:37,918
I wanted to hang everything
while the sun's out.

148
00:29:39,084 --> 00:29:41,584
You know I love doing laundry.

149
00:29:46,043 --> 00:29:50,251
- I'm going to nap for a bit.
- All right.

150
00:30:32,501 --> 00:30:34,876
"You forgot something"

151
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:48,584
You came back.

152
00:34:51,751 --> 00:34:53,418
Wait, don't go.

153
00:34:57,543 --> 00:34:59,584
Please leave us alone.

154
00:35:00,459 --> 00:35:02,418
I wanted to tell you that.

155
00:35:03,584 --> 00:35:05,584
I want to talk to you.

156
00:35:06,459 --> 00:35:08,209
Human beans are dangerous.

157
00:35:08,334 --> 00:35:12,418
If we're seen, we have to leave.
My parents said so.

158
00:35:13,543 --> 00:35:16,584
You have a family?
I envy you.

159
00:35:18,334 --> 00:35:19,876
Don't you have one?

160
00:35:20,584 --> 00:35:24,001
Yes, but I practically
never see my father.

161
00:35:24,126 --> 00:35:27,918
Mother's so busy at work,
she barely has time for me.

162
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:30,418
Really...

163
00:35:33,834 --> 00:35:37,084
My name's Sho.
What's your name?

164
00:35:40,084 --> 00:35:41,793
Do you have one?

165
00:35:43,209 --> 00:35:45,459
Of course I have a name!

166
00:35:45,584 --> 00:35:47,084
It's Arrietty.

167
00:35:47,876 --> 00:35:51,084
Arrietty. . .Arrietty...

168
00:35:52,709 --> 00:35:54,084
That's pretty.

169
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:13,793
Won't you let me see you?
Just for a moment.

170
00:36:20,334 --> 00:36:23,168
Just a peek. Please?

171
00:37:14,293 --> 00:37:17,376
What's happening?
Oh my gosh, it's a crow!

172
00:37:24,376 --> 00:37:26,334
You can't come in here!

173
00:37:40,126 --> 00:37:44,376
What got into that bird?
They never behave like that.

174
00:37:44,501 --> 00:37:47,543
Maybe it's nesting season
or something.

175
00:37:51,959 --> 00:37:56,376
Now I have to replace this screen.
Where do we keep them?

176
00:37:56,501 --> 00:37:58,751
Are you all right?

177
00:37:59,751 --> 00:38:02,918
Maybe you should take
some of your medicine.

178
00:38:03,418 --> 00:38:04,918
Thanks, Haru.

179
00:38:05,043 --> 00:38:06,584
I feel fine.

180
00:38:13,751 --> 00:38:16,918
The nesting season, eh?

181
00:38:24,168 --> 00:38:28,168
Have yourself
a nice long rest now.

182
00:39:27,584 --> 00:39:28,918
Papa“.

183
00:39:31,251 --> 00:39:34,918
- I told you to stay away.
- I'm sorry.

184
00:39:35,376 --> 00:39:38,084
I wanted to do
something to help.

185
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:40,709
But he didn't see me.

186
00:39:42,168 --> 00:39:45,043
You put your family in danger.

187
00:39:46,084 --> 00:39:49,293
I won't say it again.
Understand?

188
00:39:49,418 --> 00:39:50,418
Yes.

189
00:40:00,126 --> 00:40:02,709
We'd better start looking.

190
00:40:06,084 --> 00:40:07,626
It's time.

191
00:40:12,084 --> 00:40:13,126
Pod...

192
00:40:29,043 --> 00:40:32,918
"You forgot something"

193
00:40:47,084 --> 00:40:49,126
Afternoon! Package for you.

194
00:40:51,751 --> 00:40:54,626
Thanks again, ma'am.
It's pretty hot out there.

195
00:40:54,751 --> 00:40:58,459
Listen, know any good
pest control companies?

196
00:40:58,584 --> 00:41:00,418
Pest control?

197
00:41:02,751 --> 00:41:06,501
Here's one. "Squeaky Klean Service."

198
00:41:06,626 --> 00:41:10,251
Squeaky Klean Service?
Let me just write that down.

199
00:41:13,543 --> 00:41:15,418
Having problems with mice?

200
00:41:16,876 --> 00:41:20,584
Maybe it's mice,
or maybe it's something else.

201
00:41:22,376 --> 00:41:25,293
Between us, it's little people.

202
00:41:25,418 --> 00:41:27,418
I've seen them myself.

203
00:41:33,584 --> 00:41:37,126
A crow tried to fly
into your room?

204
00:41:37,251 --> 00:41:38,959
I hope it didn't scare you.

205
00:41:39,543 --> 00:41:42,751
Don't worry, Aunt Sadako.
Haru chased it out.

206
00:41:44,334 --> 00:41:46,751
I was so astonished!

207
00:41:46,876 --> 00:41:49,126
I never saw such a huge...

208
00:41:49,251 --> 00:41:52,959
Excitement's the worst thing
in the world for his heart.

209
00:41:53,084 --> 00:41:56,043
He came here for peace and quiet.

210
00:41:57,293 --> 00:42:00,126
If anything were to happen
before the operation...

211
00:42:00,251 --> 00:42:02,418
I know, I know.

212
00:42:03,959 --> 00:42:07,959
I realize his mother's
terribly busy at work.

213
00:42:08,084 --> 00:42:11,126
But to go abroad on business
and leave a sick child?

214
00:42:11,918 --> 00:42:15,918
It must be terribly hard for you
without your mother.

215
00:42:16,751 --> 00:42:18,626
I don't mind.

216
00:42:19,459 --> 00:42:21,918
I suppose the divorce
couldn't be helped.

217
00:42:22,459 --> 00:42:26,584
But why can't she be here,
when he needs her so?

218
00:42:34,793 --> 00:42:38,459
Aunt Sadako, who made
that little house in my room?

219
00:42:38,584 --> 00:42:40,168
It's amazing.

220
00:42:40,293 --> 00:42:42,376
You mean the doll house?

221
00:42:42,501 --> 00:42:45,709
That doll house
belongs to your mother.

222
00:42:45,834 --> 00:42:49,293
She left it here
when she moved out.

223
00:42:49,418 --> 00:42:50,418
It was hers?

224
00:42:51,084 --> 00:42:54,834
My father had it
made to order in England.

225
00:42:54,959 --> 00:42:57,459
It was for the little people.

226
00:42:59,001 --> 00:43:02,001
My father claimed he'd seen them.

227
00:43:02,126 --> 00:43:04,084
He waited for so many years.

228
00:43:04,543 --> 00:43:09,251
He always said that house
was a present for them.

229
00:43:10,251 --> 00:43:13,418
But I'm afraid they never
showed themselves again.

230
00:43:13,543 --> 00:43:17,584
Not in my father's lifetime,
nor in mine.

231
00:43:18,084 --> 00:43:22,709
Young Master, did you happen to see
any little people in your room?

232
00:43:26,626 --> 00:43:28,251
Unfortunately...no.

233
00:43:29,376 --> 00:43:32,626
It's been in our family
for four generations.

234
00:43:32,751 --> 00:43:36,959
If you like it,
it will be yours someday.

235
00:43:37,084 --> 00:43:38,584
You mean it?

236
00:43:39,084 --> 00:43:40,126
Yes.

237
00:43:40,876 --> 00:43:45,043
Have you looked inside?
It's quite beautiful!

238
00:43:49,376 --> 00:43:53,251
- Haru, could you turn off the lights?
- Yes.

239
00:44:05,126 --> 00:44:07,126
This is the living room.

240
00:44:07,251 --> 00:44:11,918
All the furnishings were hand-made
by a real furniture maker.

241
00:44:12,584 --> 00:44:15,668
Isn't it wonderful?

242
00:44:16,168 --> 00:44:21,209
Here's the library on the first floor.
There's even a bathroom.

243
00:44:21,751 --> 00:44:26,084
But the next room
is my personal favourite.

244
00:44:26,209 --> 00:44:28,876
Haru, could you open that up?

245
00:44:29,001 --> 00:44:31,918
Let's see,
I think it opens this way.

246
00:44:36,626 --> 00:44:38,418
Everything is so detailed!

247
00:44:39,584 --> 00:44:41,918
Detailed and just like the real thing.

248
00:44:42,376 --> 00:44:46,293
That's a real oven.
You could use it for baking.

249
00:44:46,418 --> 00:44:48,501
Beautiful, just beautiful.

250
00:44:48,626 --> 00:44:51,626
What a pity Father's dream
never came true.

251
00:44:51,751 --> 00:44:53,209
And it's been so long...

252
00:44:53,334 --> 00:44:56,584
Maybe the little people
are gone now.

253
00:47:17,834 --> 00:47:21,001
Mother, we've had
these pictures three years.

254
00:47:21,126 --> 00:47:22,418
Don't you want new ones?

255
00:47:22,918 --> 00:47:25,459
I love those pictures.

256
00:47:25,584 --> 00:47:29,584
I've always dreamed
I'd see the real ocean someday.

257
00:47:30,418 --> 00:47:33,709
Besides, there's no point
changing them now.

258
00:47:38,251 --> 00:47:40,626
Papa's later than usual.

259
00:47:40,751 --> 00:47:44,084
I hope he didn't get caught
in that downpour.

260
00:47:48,584 --> 00:47:51,584
- Papa?
- That's the back door.

261
00:47:55,293 --> 00:47:56,918
Papa! Welcome back...

262
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:00,793
Twisted my leg.

263
00:48:00,918 --> 00:48:03,251
It's lucky Spiller found me.

264
00:48:09,376 --> 00:48:10,626
Pod?

265
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:15,251
Oh dear, you're hurt!
Hurry, bring him in.

266
00:48:17,793 --> 00:48:19,084
Does it hurt?

267
00:48:19,209 --> 00:48:22,251
It's not broken.
I'll be fine in no time.

268
00:48:23,126 --> 00:48:25,584
I'll get some cold water.

269
00:48:27,459 --> 00:48:30,084
Here's a towel, better dry off.

270
00:48:31,209 --> 00:48:32,459
Who's this?

271
00:48:37,459 --> 00:48:40,584
It's not just the three of us after all.

272
00:48:49,251 --> 00:48:50,543
Got to go.

273
00:48:50,668 --> 00:48:53,584
Wait, at least stay
and have some tea.

274
00:49:02,209 --> 00:49:06,251
I'll see to your father.
Get Spiller a cup of tea.

275
00:49:07,959 --> 00:49:11,418
Thank you, Spiller.
Papa's so lucky you came along.

276
00:49:15,209 --> 00:49:17,251
We're so grateful for your help.

277
00:49:18,084 --> 00:49:20,626
Listen, have you seen
other Borrowers?

278
00:49:20,751 --> 00:49:24,751
You see, we thought
we might be the only ones left.

279
00:49:28,334 --> 00:49:29,543
This many.

280
00:49:30,751 --> 00:49:33,168
Then Cousin Lupy must be okay!

281
00:49:34,751 --> 00:49:36,918
Can I see your bow?

282
00:49:42,918 --> 00:49:44,918
You use this for hunting.

283
00:49:49,834 --> 00:49:52,918
Give that back. It's not a toy.

284
00:50:08,584 --> 00:50:10,251
Got to go.

285
00:50:11,918 --> 00:50:15,043
Won't you stay
and have a bite?

286
00:50:17,668 --> 00:50:19,251
Got this.

287
00:50:23,209 --> 00:50:24,418
A cricket's leg!

288
00:50:26,043 --> 00:50:28,126
Want some? It's real good.

289
00:50:28,251 --> 00:50:29,418
No thanks!

290
00:50:34,084 --> 00:50:35,126
Take care.

291
00:50:36,793 --> 00:50:38,251
Thanks again.

292
00:50:41,918 --> 00:50:43,584
I'll see him out.

293
00:50:49,918 --> 00:50:52,584
You were looking
for a new place.

294
00:50:53,543 --> 00:50:57,793
I tripped and fell. Couldn't move.
Then Spiller came.

295
00:50:57,918 --> 00:50:59,584
Really...

296
00:51:00,084 --> 00:51:03,251
His territory reaches past the river.

297
00:51:04,043 --> 00:51:07,959
And he knows a few places
we could live.

298
00:51:09,084 --> 00:51:10,834
That's good, I suppose.

299
00:51:11,918 --> 00:51:14,251
I'd hate to camp out.

300
00:51:15,668 --> 00:51:19,584
But I doubt we'll find anything
quite as nice as this.

301
00:51:23,751 --> 00:51:27,084
I'm glad there are
still others like us.

302
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:30,209
Do you have friends
and family, Spiller?

303
00:51:30,793 --> 00:51:33,626
Family? No, just me.

304
00:51:33,751 --> 00:51:36,709
Well, I hope you can come again.

305
00:51:36,834 --> 00:51:39,918
My mother's stew
is the best in the world.

306
00:52:45,251 --> 00:52:46,668
Haru?

307
00:53:05,168 --> 00:53:08,209
Arrietty, your stitches
need to be closer together.

308
00:53:08,334 --> 00:53:09,918
Pull it apart and do it again.

309
00:53:11,918 --> 00:53:15,584
Why do we need
such a big sack anyway?

310
00:53:23,251 --> 00:53:26,084
I'm going to look in on Papa.

311
00:53:28,293 --> 00:53:30,251
Papa, can I come in?

312
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:34,209
How's your leg?

313
00:53:34,876 --> 00:53:36,584
I'll be walking soon.

314
00:53:37,334 --> 00:53:38,918
Papa?

315
00:53:41,043 --> 00:53:43,209
Are we going to move?

316
00:53:44,376 --> 00:53:47,918
We were seen.
We've no choice but to move.

317
00:53:51,918 --> 00:53:55,501
I don't think every human bean
is dangerous.

318
00:53:56,834 --> 00:53:58,376
Arrietty...

319
00:53:58,501 --> 00:54:03,126
Before you were born, there were
two other families living in this house.

320
00:54:03,251 --> 00:54:06,293
One family went missing.
They just disappeared.

321
00:54:06,418 --> 00:54:08,584
The other one moved away.

322
00:54:09,084 --> 00:54:10,876
They were seen by humans.

323
00:54:11,834 --> 00:54:14,751
No matter what happens,
we've got to survive.

324
00:54:15,501 --> 00:54:16,918
Papa“.

325
00:54:33,043 --> 00:54:36,834
What in heaven's name!
Is this an earthquake?

326
00:55:01,418 --> 00:55:02,709
Mother!

327
00:55:05,251 --> 00:55:06,709
It won't open.

328
00:55:10,834 --> 00:55:12,834
The frame's buckled.

329
00:55:33,418 --> 00:55:35,918
The...the wall!

330
00:56:12,084 --> 00:56:13,376
Homily!

331
00:56:15,293 --> 00:56:16,626
Homily!

332
00:56:18,418 --> 00:56:21,918
I always dreamed
of having a kitchen like this.

333
00:57:27,001 --> 00:57:29,751
Gather only the things we need.

334
00:57:37,418 --> 00:57:40,001
We can't carry all that.

335
00:57:40,126 --> 00:57:43,751
And Homily, take nothing
from the doll house.

336
00:57:45,918 --> 00:57:47,918
I'll make sure it's safe.

337
00:57:48,668 --> 00:57:51,209
- Stay with your mother.
- Yes.

338
00:58:23,501 --> 00:58:25,084
You finally came.

339
00:58:35,084 --> 00:58:37,876
Do you like your new kitchen?

340
00:58:39,626 --> 00:58:41,876
Our house is a disaster.

341
00:58:44,251 --> 00:58:47,251
But it doesn't matter.
I came to say goodbye.

342
00:58:52,334 --> 00:58:53,751
Can I look?

343
00:59:18,209 --> 00:59:19,543
You're beautiful.

344
00:59:22,918 --> 00:59:24,876
We have to move.

345
00:59:26,001 --> 00:59:27,751
We were seen.

346
00:59:28,709 --> 00:59:31,626
Borrowers aren't meant to be seen.

347
00:59:31,751 --> 00:59:35,709
- Borrowers...?
- We borrow from human beans.

348
00:59:35,834 --> 00:59:38,209
Things we need.
Things they won't miss.

349
00:59:39,126 --> 00:59:42,584
Soap and cookies and sugar.
Electricity and gas, too.

350
00:59:43,126 --> 00:59:46,334
Even my great-grandfather
was a Borrower.

351
00:59:47,459 --> 00:59:51,959
- No one ever saw them?
- Probably.

352
00:59:54,876 --> 00:59:56,918
It's all my fault.

353
00:59:58,584 --> 01:00:01,918
Niya, don't be like that.
Be nice to her.

354
01:00:03,376 --> 01:00:07,418
Are there other little people like you
in the house?

355
01:00:08,251 --> 01:00:11,418
No, it's just my father
and mother and me.

356
01:00:12,084 --> 01:00:13,834
What about in other houses?

357
01:00:13,959 --> 01:00:17,751
I'm sure there are some.
I've only met one so far.

358
01:00:18,418 --> 01:00:19,459
Oh.

359
01:00:20,959 --> 01:00:24,209
Soon you'll be the only one left.

360
01:00:25,751 --> 01:00:28,376
Every year there's fewer of you, right?

361
01:00:28,918 --> 01:00:32,251
You're a doomed species, you know.

362
01:00:34,668 --> 01:00:36,209
That's not true!

363
01:00:36,334 --> 01:00:39,626
There's lots more of us.
Spiller said so!

364
01:00:40,209 --> 01:00:41,626
Spiller?

365
01:00:41,751 --> 01:00:43,418
He's one of us.

366
01:00:43,959 --> 01:00:46,918
And he said there's lots more.

367
01:00:48,418 --> 01:00:53,001
Do you know how many people
there are in the world?

368
01:00:54,918 --> 01:00:57,084
There are 6.7 billion of us.

369
01:00:58,126 --> 01:01:00,126
Six point seven billion...?

370
01:01:00,876 --> 01:01:02,209
What about you?

371
01:01:03,001 --> 01:01:04,584
I don't know.

372
01:01:05,251 --> 01:01:07,959
There's probably
just a few of you.

373
01:01:08,084 --> 01:01:12,084
Until my mother told me,
I didn't know little people existed.

374
01:01:14,251 --> 01:01:17,751
Lots of species are already extinct.

375
01:01:18,834 --> 01:01:21,418
I've only seen them
in books, though.

376
01:01:22,418 --> 01:01:24,876
So many beautiful species...

377
01:01:25,001 --> 01:01:28,709
But the environment changed,
so they died out.

378
01:01:29,168 --> 01:01:33,751
It's sad, but that's what fate
has in store for your kind.

379
01:01:35,418 --> 01:01:36,876
Fate, you say?

380
01:01:37,584 --> 01:01:42,084
You're the one who changed things.
Now we have to move away.

381
01:01:43,459 --> 01:01:46,209
We have to survive.
That's what Papa said.

382
01:01:46,668 --> 01:01:49,209
So we're leaving,
even though it's dangerous.

383
01:01:50,001 --> 01:01:55,584
We'll make do, we always have.
You don't know anything about us!

384
01:01:56,043 --> 01:01:59,293
We're not going
to die out that easily!

385
01:02:01,584 --> 01:02:04,876
I'm sorry. You're right.

386
01:02:05,793 --> 01:02:08,209
I'm the one
who's going to die.

387
01:02:13,376 --> 01:02:15,209
It's my heart.

388
01:02:15,751 --> 01:02:19,584
They're going to operate next week,
but it's probably hopeless.

389
01:02:19,709 --> 01:02:21,084
Your heart...?

390
01:02:23,209 --> 01:02:26,751
I've always been sick.
I can't play like other kids.

391
01:02:27,584 --> 01:02:32,043
From the moment I saw you,
I wanted to protect you.

392
01:02:32,168 --> 01:02:34,418
I can't even do that.

393
01:02:35,084 --> 01:02:37,459
I hope you can forgive me.

394
01:02:38,959 --> 01:02:41,334
I didn't know
you were so sick.

395
01:03:06,001 --> 01:03:08,876
What in the world
is this doing here?

396
01:03:36,084 --> 01:03:38,918
It's the kitchen
from the doll house!

397
01:03:55,126 --> 01:03:57,084
Found you!

398
01:04:02,584 --> 01:04:03,876
What's wrong?

399
01:04:04,459 --> 01:04:07,668
My mother...l heard her voice.

400
01:04:38,793 --> 01:04:42,084
This really is a great kitchen.

401
01:04:42,626 --> 01:04:45,668
You're not the only
little one here, I bet.

402
01:05:08,251 --> 01:05:10,543
I have to go.

403
01:05:57,459 --> 01:06:00,459
Let me out! Help me!

404
01:07:08,626 --> 01:07:10,418
The ceiling's tilted.

405
01:08:36,668 --> 01:08:39,876
Hello? Squeaky Klean Service?

406
01:08:40,001 --> 01:08:42,626
Can you make
an urgent house call?

407
01:08:42,751 --> 01:08:45,793
There's something small
in the house. No, not mice.

408
01:08:45,918 --> 01:08:49,709
- No! <i>mice?</i>
- I don't want them killed.

409
01:08:49,834 --> 01:08:51,584
<i>You need trapping services ?</i>

410
01:08:51,709 --> 01:08:54,459
Yes, that's it.
I want you to trap them.

411
01:09:05,459 --> 01:09:07,084
Sho!Sho!

412
01:09:10,709 --> 01:09:11,918
Arrietty!

413
01:09:17,793 --> 01:09:19,126
Mother's gone!

414
01:09:20,251 --> 01:09:24,251
Someone took the roof off.
I think a human bean got her!

415
01:09:29,918 --> 01:09:31,668
Mother...

416
01:09:41,709 --> 01:09:43,293
We'll find her.

417
01:10:18,334 --> 01:10:20,209
Ifslocked.

418
01:10:23,584 --> 01:10:26,418
Let's try the room next door.

419
01:10:46,209 --> 01:10:48,584
- Can't budge it.
- Wait!

420
01:10:58,918 --> 01:11:01,043
I can fit.

421
01:11:35,209 --> 01:11:36,501
Amazing!

422
01:12:11,876 --> 01:12:14,251
No, that's not it.

423
01:12:15,126 --> 01:12:18,459
There's a dirt road.
Turn in there.

424
01:12:18,584 --> 01:12:21,418
<i>- Before the bridge?
- No, not that one!</i>

425
01:12:29,751 --> 01:12:32,126
Haru opened this.

426
01:12:32,584 --> 01:12:35,584
Then she must've taken
Mother someplace.

427
01:13:12,084 --> 01:13:13,709
Are you okay?

428
01:13:23,418 --> 01:13:26,418
What's taking them so long?

429
01:14:00,001 --> 01:14:02,668
Mother! Where are you?

430
01:14:18,751 --> 01:14:21,293
But the lock...

431
01:14:21,418 --> 01:14:22,876
Lock?

432
01:14:25,084 --> 01:14:27,626
Could I have some hot milk?

433
01:14:27,751 --> 01:14:30,459
Okay, wait just a minute.

434
01:14:39,751 --> 01:14:41,251
Thanks.

435
01:15:18,876 --> 01:15:22,584
I'm a little hungry.
Are there any cookies?

436
01:15:28,751 --> 01:15:30,084
Mother!

437
01:15:31,668 --> 01:15:33,209
Mother!

438
01:15:40,751 --> 01:15:43,293
- Mother?
- Arrietty!

439
01:15:50,376 --> 01:15:52,834
Here I am, Arrietty!

440
01:15:52,959 --> 01:15:54,084
Mother!

441
01:15:58,209 --> 01:15:59,918
Arrietty!

442
01:16:26,751 --> 01:16:31,418
There they are.
They finally found the right road.

443
01:16:52,501 --> 01:16:54,584
Another human bean!

444
01:16:58,376 --> 01:17:00,084
It's all right, Mother.

445
01:17:23,293 --> 01:17:26,543
We'd like to take a look
around first.

446
01:17:26,668 --> 01:17:28,084
Take your time.

447
01:17:52,626 --> 01:17:55,126
Now who can this be?

448
01:17:56,251 --> 01:17:58,418
Haru? Haru!

449
01:18:00,626 --> 01:18:02,543
What's going on here?

450
01:18:02,668 --> 01:18:06,459
It's finally happened.
The little people are here!

451
01:18:06,584 --> 01:18:08,043
Little people?

452
01:18:09,293 --> 01:18:13,084
That's right.
And what little thieves they are!

453
01:18:26,084 --> 01:18:28,251
It's really true.

454
01:18:33,251 --> 01:18:35,543
They steal from
all over the house.

455
01:18:35,668 --> 01:18:38,876
That's why things
were going missing.

456
01:18:39,918 --> 01:18:42,209
Haru, what's got into you?

457
01:18:42,334 --> 01:18:45,168
All these years I thought
it was my imagination.

458
01:18:45,293 --> 01:18:47,251
Well, it wasn't.

459
01:18:48,001 --> 01:18:51,543
You certainly didn't need
to call the exterminators.

460
01:18:52,751 --> 01:18:56,043
We'd better hurry.
The house is full of them!

461
01:18:57,751 --> 01:19:00,043
You'll believe me
when you see this.

462
01:19:00,709 --> 01:19:02,959
This is their nest.

463
01:19:04,751 --> 01:19:06,418
Nest?

464
01:19:11,751 --> 01:19:15,084
It looks like a pile
of old junk to me.

465
01:19:18,376 --> 01:19:21,251
What? I swear I saw it.

466
01:19:22,584 --> 01:19:25,626
Haru, I'm sending
the exterminators away.

467
01:19:25,751 --> 01:19:28,209
Now, wait just a minute.

468
01:19:29,543 --> 01:19:31,668
The doll house!

469
01:19:39,209 --> 01:19:41,668
Young Master? May we come in
for a minute?

470
01:19:41,918 --> 01:19:42,918
All right.

471
01:19:54,418 --> 01:19:58,334
You won't believe this.
They stole the little kitchen too.

472
01:19:59,876 --> 01:20:02,709
You'll see, it's gone.

473
01:20:06,293 --> 01:20:07,668
It's not gone.

474
01:20:07,793 --> 01:20:10,084
Such a pleasure to look at.

475
01:20:23,251 --> 01:20:27,084
Wait, I can prove it!
I have one of them in a jar.

476
01:20:30,043 --> 01:20:33,084
I wonder what's got into Haru.

477
01:20:33,584 --> 01:20:34,584
Hmm?

478
01:20:36,959 --> 01:20:39,084
Fresh herbs, how lovely.

479
01:20:54,084 --> 01:20:56,209
Someone was making tea!

480
01:20:58,209 --> 01:21:02,584
It's just as my father said.
There are little people living here.

481
01:21:05,793 --> 01:21:07,084
Yes, there are.

482
01:21:08,084 --> 01:21:10,543
So Haru really saw them.

483
01:21:10,668 --> 01:21:13,293
Though she accused them of stealing.

484
01:21:13,418 --> 01:21:16,918
They're not thieves at all!
They're Borrowers.

485
01:21:18,751 --> 01:21:21,584
I mean, I wish I could see them.

486
01:21:23,584 --> 01:21:26,084
I bet they're here somewhere.

487
01:21:30,918 --> 01:21:33,084
I'm sure they are.

488
01:21:46,584 --> 01:21:48,959
Excuse me, ma'am!

489
01:21:49,501 --> 01:21:51,751
Where'd you like us to start?

490
01:22:00,293 --> 01:22:02,084
Are you all right?

491
01:22:04,751 --> 01:22:06,876
It got away.

492
01:22:07,001 --> 01:22:09,668
I had one and it got away!

493
01:22:09,793 --> 01:22:13,418
It's not just my imagination.
There are little people here!

494
01:22:14,501 --> 01:22:16,543
Next time I swear I'll get them!

495
01:22:32,001 --> 01:22:35,918
How far is it to where
we're meeting Spiller?

496
01:22:37,084 --> 01:22:40,584
It's just outside the forest.
Then we head down river.

497
01:22:41,918 --> 01:22:46,584
I'm already worn out.
I'll never make it that far.

498
01:23:02,126 --> 01:23:03,626
Let's hurry.

499
01:23:04,709 --> 01:23:06,418
I can't do it...

500
01:23:32,918 --> 01:23:37,584
Better have something to eat.
We'll be walking till morning.

501
01:23:40,751 --> 01:23:42,376
I'm so sorry.

502
01:23:43,251 --> 01:23:47,751
It's my fault we had to leave
such a wonderful house.

503
01:23:52,001 --> 01:23:53,793
That's in the past.

504
01:23:54,918 --> 01:23:58,751
We'll make another wonderful house,
the three of us together.

505
01:24:04,709 --> 01:24:06,751
I'm going outside for a bit.

506
01:24:08,251 --> 01:24:10,251
Don't go too far, now.

507
01:24:45,584 --> 01:24:47,126
Niya!

508
01:25:56,918 --> 01:25:58,501
Niya...

509
01:26:17,084 --> 01:26:18,751
Just a little further.

510
01:26:41,584 --> 01:26:43,084
Spiller!

511
01:26:57,793 --> 01:26:59,584
That's everything.

512
01:27:00,876 --> 01:27:03,043
Now let's get moving.

513
01:27:03,168 --> 01:27:04,418
Okay.

514
01:27:08,834 --> 01:27:11,084
Mother, are you all right?

515
01:27:23,084 --> 01:27:24,584
Arrietty!

516
01:27:54,834 --> 01:27:56,293
She!

517
01:28:00,084 --> 01:28:01,584
Arrietty...

518
01:28:20,918 --> 01:28:22,959
We're leaving now.

519
01:28:27,751 --> 01:28:29,793
I'm glad I made it.

520
01:28:33,584 --> 01:28:35,751
Niya showed me the way.

521
01:28:43,376 --> 01:28:46,251
Thanks. Take care of yourself.

522
01:28:52,293 --> 01:28:54,043
I brought this.

523
01:28:59,876 --> 01:29:03,251
I hope you'll accept it this time.

524
01:29:09,043 --> 01:29:10,543
Thank you.

525
01:29:24,251 --> 01:29:26,418
I have to go.

526
01:29:27,751 --> 01:29:30,043
When is your operation?

527
01:29:30,168 --> 01:29:32,126
The day after tomorrow.

528
01:29:32,251 --> 01:29:36,584
I'm going to be okay.
You gave me the courage to live.

529
01:29:45,126 --> 01:29:46,918
For luck.

530
01:29:51,793 --> 01:29:53,334
Thanks.

531
01:30:00,043 --> 01:30:02,584
You protected me after all.

532
01:30:04,751 --> 01:30:06,418
Arrietty...

533
01:30:08,793 --> 01:30:11,751
I hope you have the best life ever.

534
01:30:14,293 --> 01:30:15,584
Goodbye.

535
01:30:19,501 --> 01:30:24,584
Arrietty, you're a part
of me now.

536
01:30:24,709 --> 01:30:27,918
I'll never forget you, ever.

537
01:33:56,376 --> 01:34:01,584
A Studio Ghibli Film

538
01:34:03,959 --> 01:34:08,418
