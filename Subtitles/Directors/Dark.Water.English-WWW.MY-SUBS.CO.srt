1
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,430
Dahlia, let's go inside now.

2
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:52,010
She'll come soon,
but let's go inside now.

3
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:55,980
What are we gonna do,
Dahlia?

4
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,980
What are we gonna do
about your mother always being so late?

5
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:33,810
- Hi.
- Hi.

6
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:38,850
Did you ring?

7
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:41,100
It's not 11.

8
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:43,400
You didn't ring.

9
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:55,660
Good. You're early.
You can come right in.

10
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,000
- You've been subletting?
- Right.

11
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:00,420
When my construction company moved
to New York, the rents were outta sight,

12
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,670
so we only took
a one-year lease.

13
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:03,920
And when my wife
asked me to leave,

14
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,670
I got a small one-bedroom
in Jersey City that's cheap.

15
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,130
- How much?
- 800.

16
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:10,800
Where will Cecilia sleep then?

17
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:13,720
There's a pullout couch in the living room,
so when she comes to stay with me,

18
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:17,310
I'll sleep there.
I can't afford two bedrooms.

19
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,980
How 'bout you, Dahlia? We need to know
what your situation is gonna be.

20
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:23,020
Any luck in finding a suitable place
for you and Cecilia?

21
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:26,110
- I'm looking at apartments today.
- Where?

22
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:28,820
- Where?
- I told you, I'm moving to Jersey City.

23
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:32,360
There's a school there, it's great. And
there's plenty of cheap places to rent, so...

24
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:36,160
You got an apartment near me, it would
make the shared custody easier.

25
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,660
Why do you want her, Kyle?

26
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:40,620
- What do you mean, "Why do I want her?"
- You were never interested in her before.

27
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:43,250
- What?
- You know, he forgot her fifth birthday.

28
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:45,040
- No. No, I didn't.
- No?

29
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:49,090
No, I didn't. The plane was stuck
on the tarmac, and we didn't have a gate.

30
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:52,260
I told you a million times,
the phones didn't work.

31
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,930
No one believes you, cos everyone
knows what you were doing.

32
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,140
- "Everyone"? No, you. Only you.
- OK.

33
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:59,850
You see? She's crazy.
You live in a world of your own.

34
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,890
I make one mistake,
and I don't care about Ceci?

35
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,060
- You don't like playing with her.
- You're insane. You're insane.

36
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:18,330
Be honest with yourself. You can't raise
Ceci alone. You can't handle it.

37
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:21,370
Just be honest with yourself.

38
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:08,380
Isn't it funny
how small the cars look?

39
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:11,000
- Yeah.
- If you look at them from up here.

40
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:13,800
Fit them between your fingers,
if you squint.

41
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,680
Yeah.

42
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:21,390
Oh, look.
There's a tram.

43
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:27,060
And that's where we're going,
Roosevelt Island.

44
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:36,150
Mommy, that's not the city.

45
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,370
Sure it is.
Just a different part of the city.

46
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:42,580
No, that's the city over there.
That's not the city.

47
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,290
- She's right.
- Mm-hm.

48
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:54,800
Here we are.

49
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,880
It is chilly, though, isn't it?
Are you cold?

50
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:58,140
Yeah, a little bit.

51
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:01,680
Yeah? Hey, look,
that's where you'd go to school.

52
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:04,220
I don't want
to go to school here.

53
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:05,680
Why not?

54
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:08,060
It's too small.

55
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:10,610
Oh, I see.

56
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:11,860
Mm-hm.

57
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:14,570
- You know, I got your snack for ya.
- You do?

58
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:16,650
Yeah. Are you hungry now?
Do you want it now?

59
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:19,280
- Maybe I'll wait.
- OK.

60
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:23,160
Let's just check.

61
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:25,040
Let's see.

62
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,370
540...

63
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:28,830
Just...

64
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:30,710
40...

65
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,170
That way.

66
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:34,880
OK.

67
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:38,260
It's nice here.
It's like a small town.

68
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,470
I like the big city better.

69
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:43,430
Why didn't we rent that last place?
That was really nice.

70
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,230
It was. It was too expensive for us, honey.
We need something that's a better price.

71
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:50,060
But I don't want
to live here, Mommy.

72
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:52,810
Why not, Ceci?

73
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:56,150
It's all the same.
And it's small. Too small.

74
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,450
"It's too small"?
I think you're too small.

75
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:00,410
- No, I'm not. I'm big.
- Small.

76
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:02,070
- I'm big.
- OK, good.

77
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,200
Then are you gonna be a big girl,
and give this one a chance?

78
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:06,080
Yeah? Cos otherwise
you know what happens?

79
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:06,540
What?

80
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:12,380
My itsy-bitsy muffin. I cover you all up
with jam like this, and then...

81
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,590
And then eat you up.

82
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:20,340
OK. That's us.

83
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:23,470
We are a little bit early.

84
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,430
We need...
Oh, golly. Five...

85
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:28,810
- Hi.
- Hi.

86
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:32,100
- Are you Mrs. Bernstein?
- No, I'm Ms Williams.

87
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:35,980
Ah, Ms Williams. Oh, you're early.
Mr. Murray. We spoke on the phone.

88
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:38,780
Listen, since the Bernsteins aren't here,
I can show you the apartment now.

89
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,280
You're lucky to get
a jump on them, actually.

90
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,490
OK, that'd be great.

91
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,030
- So we'll just go up, and...
- Thanks.

92
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:45,620
- Hello.
- Hi.

93
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,370
These tend to go pretty quick.

94
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:55,670
You know, Manhattan is so expensive,
and this is practically in Manhattan.

95
00:06:55,790 --> 00:07:00,510
- I mean, it's five minutes away.
- Yucky. This is yucky.

96
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:05,550
It is yucky down here, which is why we are
repainting all these lobbies this summer.

97
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:09,640
And I think they're replacing all the doors, if
I'm not mistaken. It'll make it a lot brighter.

98
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,480
This is Mr. Veeck.
He is the super for building C.

99
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,230
Hello.

100
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:16,860
Mr. Veeck,
can you say hello?

101
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,230
- Hello.
- This is... What's your name?

102
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,940
- Dahlia. This is Ceci.
- I'm sorry. Dahlia and Ceci.

103
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:23,740
Uh... Mr. Veeck lives in 1 A.
He's been here for 20 years.

104
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,280
He'll fix anything
that goes wrong.

105
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:26,950
- Oh, that's good.
- Which is a big savings,

106
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,200
cos he does it for free.

107
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:31,910
There's also a doorman on duty
from four to midnight here,

108
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,330
so you don't have to worry about
coming in late. And that is the lobby.

109
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:40,420
Mr. Veeck, if the Bernsteins show up,
just send them right up to 9F.

110
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:41,840
- OK.
- 9F.

111
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,680
OK.

112
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,550
OK, so,
we'll just head up here.

113
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,890
- Did you take the Tram?
- Yeah.

114
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,390
- Oh, you did. Did you like that?
- Yeah.

115
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,770
You get to do that every day
when you live in this building.

116
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:04,950
Oh, yeah. There's the camera.
Say hi. Mr. Veeck is watching us.

117
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:09,450
I'm gonna take you up to nine. Almost our
top floor. I call it the lower penthouse level.

118
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,290
Um...
You get some city views up there.

119
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:15,870
A little cut off,
but you can still see the city lights, at night.

120
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,500
Oh, you know,
we're two blocks from the school,

121
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:19,800
which is one of the best
in the city.

122
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,460
Yeah, I was just reading that.

123
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:23,510
- Isn't that great?
- No.

124
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:26,340
- I don't like it here, Mommy. I wanna...
- Ceci, please.

125
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:29,350
- Sorry, Mommy.
- That's OK.

126
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:31,140
It's OK.
You're gonna love it up here.

127
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:35,890
And they just opened a pizza place on
the island. Do you like pizza? I bet you do.

128
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:39,520
I like pizza, too.
I like it a little bit too much.

129
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:42,110
Wait, sweetie.
Don't run. Don't run.

130
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:55,080
What the...

131
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,700
Get stuck in here, huh?

132
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:38,500
- Mommy, what happened?
- Sorry. It's all right.

133
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:41,920
Dammit.
Another puddle.

134
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,960
Sorry about that. I keep telling Mr. Veeck
he's gotta mop in there every morning.

135
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:47,920
You know,
with all this rain we're having,

136
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:50,640
you can't stop some of it
coming down that elevator shaft.

137
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,600
There's just no way to stop it.
Anyway, here's 9F down here.

138
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,440
The building was built in 1976
by Stern-Jackson and associates,

139
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,270
in the brutalist style.

140
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:04,520
Um... Now, what they were trying to create,
as you can see, was kind of a little village,

141
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:07,070
kind of a Utopia, actually,
is what they had in mind.

142
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:09,780
And some of those ideas
have come together.

143
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:15,240
Some of their original plans for the place
were a little crazy, if you ask me, actually.

144
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:17,370
Hello.

145
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,170
Yeah, I just do that
just in case. It's vacant.

146
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,630
- Come on in.
- Shall I close this?

147
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:25,130
Yeah. Let me just apologize in advance.
The place is in a little bit of a mess.

148
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,420
Our last tenant
was a little messy,

149
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:29,510
but we're gonna put a fresh new
coat of paint on this whole place.

150
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:32,840
It's gonna brighten it up quite a bit.
Let's take a look at your bedroom, sweetie.

151
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:35,640
This could be your room
if Mommy wants it to be.

152
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,480
- What do you think? Isn't that great?
- There's no air in here.

153
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:43,190
Of course there's air in here. If there
wasn't air, we wouldn't be able to breathe.

154
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:47,150
Uh... That window does not open, but it lets
a lot of natural light in in the afternoons.

155
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,860
- It's really great.
- Strange.

156
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:52,570
I kinda like it. In the afternoon,
it brightens the place up quite a bit.

157
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,530
Anyway, here's the closet.

158
00:10:54,620 --> 00:11:00,580
You could put your dollies in there,
or, you know, Mom could use it for storage.

159
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,670
- Lemme show you the bathroom. OK?
- OK.

160
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:07,550
Come on, honey.
Is this another closet here?

161
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:10,720
Yeah, that's the foyer closet.

162
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:15,430
The bathroom's pretty self-explanatory.
It's in decent shape. Once we clean it up.

163
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,600
You got the toilet, of course,
the sink, bathtub.

164
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,140
This glass is safety glass.

165
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:23,980
I mean, you could hit that
as hard as you want, it will not break.

166
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:27,110
And that is great for your peace of mind,
you know, when Ceci's taking a bath.

167
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:31,240
Hey, Ceci.
Come look in here.

168
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:36,580
Ah, you're right. That's much better.
You can smell the river. Can you smell it?

169
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:39,790
- Yeah.
- Let me show you the other bedroom here.

170
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:42,290
You know, it's tough
to get two bedrooms in Manhattan,

171
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:45,380
any of the boroughs,
for under a thousand dollars.

172
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,670
OK, that's a closet.
Scratch that. That's a closet.

173
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:52,050
Um... Kitchen.

174
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:55,390
Got the refrigerator,
sink, stove,

175
00:11:55,510 --> 00:12:00,390
and this is kind of
a country eat-in dining room.

176
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:03,440
You see this.
It's just really smart how they did this.

177
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:06,400
See that little thing?
Boom - dining room.

178
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,440
You can put your stools around it,
and when you're done -

179
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,480
out of the way, no clutter.

180
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:14,780
The dishwasher, if you're entertaining,
very convenient to have.

181
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:17,070
Kitchen. OK.

182
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,950
And then here
is the other bedroom.

183
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:24,960
So, where's the living room?

184
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,540
Well, it's kind of
a living room slash bedroom.

185
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:30,500
It's called a dual-use room. You can see
it's the size of two rooms. It's huge.

186
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:33,300
Anyway, did you see the view?
Did you see that?

187
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:36,510
Look at that. That is a million-dollar view
for $900 a month.

188
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,600
I mean,
I don't even have that where I live.

189
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,350
You're not gonna do better than that,
I guarantee it.

190
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,800
Listen, I'm just gonna
cut to the chase here.

191
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:16,420
We could have this painted this weekend.
You could move in on Monday,

192
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:18,720
and, you know,
we could just fill out the forms right now.

193
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:22,310
I understand - you want some time
to walk around, think about it.

194
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:24,390
- Let me just check on Ceci.
- Sure, sure. Yeah.

195
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,140
Ceci.

196
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:29,600
She's just making herself at home.
That's OK, Mom.

197
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:31,900
Ceci.

198
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,360
You know how they are.
She's just exploring.

199
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:59,680
- Mr. Veeck. Mr. Veeck.
- Did my daughter come down here?

200
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,640
- What?
- My daughter.

201
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,180
- The little girl I came in with.
- The little girl. Did she get on the elevator?

202
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:05,720
No. I see no one.
Just him.

203
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:09,140
Yeah, there was a little girl
in the stairwell.

204
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:15,440
Ceci.

205
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,740
Ceci.

206
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:29,460
Ceci.

207
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,870
Ceci.

208
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,290
Are you in there?

209
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:36,000
- Hello.
- Yeah?

210
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:38,380
- What are you doing down here?
- I saw someone go in.

211
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:42,510
Did you check the stairs
all the way to the roof?

212
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,680
Ceci.

213
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:53,400
Look, Mommy.
Hello Kitty. I got a Hello Kitty bag.

214
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:56,570
Ceci. Don't you ever do that again.
Do you understand?

215
00:14:56,690 --> 00:15:00,530
Don't you ever run away from me,
and you never come up on the roof.

216
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,030
- Sorry.
- Do you understand me?

217
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:06,030
It's not safe for you up here.
You could have fallen.

218
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,120
- Sorry, Mommy.
- OK?

219
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:11,870
How can you leave this unlocked? There's
no railing here. It's totally irresponsible.

220
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:15,040
- It's supposed to be locked.
- Well, it wasn't.

221
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:16,920
Yeah. Sorry.

222
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:19,210
- Are you OK, honey?
- Yeah.

223
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:30,060
You're so lucky you found that.

224
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:33,690
My niece loves Hello Kitty.
Did you look inside it?

225
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:36,480
- No. Mommy, can I look?
- It's not yours, sweetie.

226
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:39,730
Oh, I'm sure she can keep it. There's no
other children in the building. Someone...

227
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:43,160
No children?
Why? It's so close to the school.

228
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:46,200
They all grew up.
You know, they're all teenagers now.

229
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,370
You know, hardly anybody
ever moves out cos of rent control.

230
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:52,540
Oh, there are other children on the island.
You know, in the other buildings.

231
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:56,630
You would have
many, many friends.

232
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,750
So cute.

233
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:02,130
Mr. Veeck, why was the door
to the roof open?

234
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:03,430
- What?
- The roof.

235
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:05,640
My daughter
found this on the roof.

236
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,470
- The roof? Where?
- Just lying there.

237
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,680
Mr. Veeck. Why didn't you
lock the door to the roof?

238
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:13,310
- I did.
- No.

239
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,850
She opened it and walked right out.
Now, what if she'd gotten hurt?

240
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:18,860
That's negligence, Mr. Veeck,
and I'll call the union myself.

241
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:21,360
You get fired for cause,
and you can kiss that pension goodbye.

242
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,070
What do you talk about?
I check it. Hour ago, it was locked.

243
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,950
- Someone else open it.
- Well, whose bag is this?

244
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:30,580
- What do I know?
- Well, look inside it, please.

245
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,200
I'm so sorry about this.

246
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:35,790
As you can see, we're having a little bit of a
communication problem. We'll work it out.

247
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,710
I was wondering
if you have a card, so...

248
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:40,090
Oh, absolutely.
Absolutely.

249
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:41,960
- Just don't wait too long.
- Hey. Hey.

250
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:45,260
Ceci.
That's not yours. OK?

251
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:48,720
You can't keep that. Look, it's brand-new.
Someone's gonna come back for it.

252
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,140
Can you give it back,
please?

253
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:52,770
- Doll.
- Ceci.

254
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:55,850
- Aw. Poor thing.
- Good girl. Thank you.

255
00:16:55,980 --> 00:17:00,190
I'll tell you what. Mr. Veeck will hold onto it
for a week, and if no one comes,

256
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,280
then you can come by
and get it. OK?

257
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,530
- In one week.
- No one comes, it's yours.

258
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:06,200
You see? You'll see,
no one will come.

259
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,990
Thank you, Mr. Veeck.
Please check on that lock again.

260
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:10,660
Thank you.

261
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,540
We're gonna live here,
right, Mommy?

262
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:15,210
- What?
- We're gonna move here, right?

263
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:17,500
I want to.
I really wanna move here.

264
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:20,090
See?
From the mouths of babes.

265
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:24,300
- Excuse me just one moment.
- OK.

266
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:25,670
Talk about it, I guess.

267
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,720
Now, we don't have to move here
for you to get a Hello Kitty backpack.

268
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:31,010
- I know that.
- You know that?

269
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:34,520
I really like this place, Mommy.
I wanna live here.

270
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,440
You said it was
the right kind of price for us.

271
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:41,270
I did say that.
It's a little bit smaller than I hoped.

272
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,070
Please, Mommy.
Can we live here?

273
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:46,780
I'm over here.
Over here.

274
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,410
Over here.

275
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:57,160
- We'll take it.
- Oh, I have the Bernsteins...

276
00:17:57,290 --> 00:17:59,960
I'll give you a deposit right now.

277
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:03,590
- You're sure?
- Yeah. I'm sure.

278
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:05,380
- OK.
- OK.

279
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:08,680
Yeah. I have the forms here, if you want.
We can go in... Let's go back in the office.

280
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,510
OK. Ceci,
you wanna come?

281
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:16,220
I'll be right back. I can explain to them.
That's all right. They have a lot of choices.

282
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:16,730
Come on.

283
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:19,270
Cos it's insanely inconvenient,
that's why.

284
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:22,860
I gotta drive through the tunnel, get uptown
to cross the 59th Street Bridge to Queens,

285
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:25,230
so I can cross another goddamn bridge
to get to the island.

286
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,780
- You could take the subway.
- The subway?

287
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:30,360
You want me to take the PATH to the F?
Are you kidding me? It’ll take an hour.

288
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:31,200
I'm suing.

289
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,120
- What?
- You move there, I'll sue for full custody.

290
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,240
Mr. Williams.
Threats are not appropriate.

291
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:38,580
- Ms Williams has a right to rent...
- Are you moving to Roosevelt Island?

292
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:39,960
- Look at this.
- I want an answer.

293
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,170
Look at this. The elementary school there
is one of the best in the city,

294
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:47,010
and it's practically next door, so all Ceci
would have to do is walk two blocks.

295
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:49,630
Just look at it.

296
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,300
If this is really about Ceci, maybe
you could move to Roosevelt Island,

297
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:54,720
cos there are
lots of places for rent there.

298
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:56,770
- That's ridiculous.
- Is it? Why?

299
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:59,310
- I already signed a lease.
- You're lying.

300
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:00,940
- I'm not listening to this.
- She's there.

301
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:03,520
She's in Jersey City,
and that's what this is really about.

302
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:06,530
I'm done talking.
Better get yourself a lawyer.

303
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:08,780
A good one.

304
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:14,660
I'm sorry to say
that's good advice.

305
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,390
- Nobody came, right?
- What?

306
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:41,770
The Hello Kitty bag.
Nobody came, right?

307
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:46,650
It's only been four days, kid.
Don't get your hopes up.

308
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:49,150
Hey.

309
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:51,280
- Hello.
- Hello.

310
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:56,580
- After you, my love.
- Thank you.

311
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:13,260
Let's try...

312
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:16,260
- In here?
- No.

313
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:21,600
I'm ready for something to drink.
How about you?

314
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,600
Or maybe something to eat.

315
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:27,230
Ooh, let's put you in the box.

316
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:31,820
Can you
hold your breath underwater?

317
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:34,030
- Yeah.
- You can?

318
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:36,490
How long do you think
you can hold it for?

319
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:38,200
- Seven.
- Really?

320
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:38,780
Uh-huh.

321
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:41,410
Look, Mommy.
Look how high I can jump.

322
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:44,120
Are you trying to break your new bed
on the first night?

323
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:45,960
- No.
- Don't break your bed.

324
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:49,540
OK. Look, Mommy.
I'm gonna reach the ceiling.

325
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:59,850
What is that?

326
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:02,140
Looks like a leak.

327
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,850
How?

328
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:08,900
I'll have to tell them about that
in the morning.

329
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:12,570
Horrible.

330
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:15,360
Anyway, what shall we read?

331
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:23,410
Wow.

332
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,710
The sound really carries.

333
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:27,290
Yeah.

334
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,640
- Mommy.
- Hm?

335
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:47,600
- Can you fix my hair?
- I'd love to fix your hair.

336
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:51,900
What do you want?
Do you want a ponytail? Or a braid?

337
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,190
- A braid.
- OK.

338
00:21:56,530 --> 00:21:58,990
You wanna practice for today?

339
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:01,160
OK.

340
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,540
Boys and girls,

341
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:07,250
today I want you to meet
your new classmate.

342
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:12,840
Her name is Cecilia Williams.
Everyone say hello to Cecilia.

343
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,010
- Hi, Cecilia.
- Hi.

344
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:21,340
I think
you can do better than that.

345
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:23,810
Do you wanna try again?

346
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:25,600
OK.

347
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:30,600
- Hi, Cecilia.
- Hi, everybody.

348
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:32,690
That's my girl.

349
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:39,280
That's my smart,
beautiful, beautiful girl.

350
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:45,120
How's that?

351
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,790
It's perfect.
You do it perfect.

352
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:51,750
You get your shoes on,
which are right there.

353
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:54,540
Keys, which are...

354
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:57,840
I know where they are.

355
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:02,590
Shit. Shit!

356
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,430
- Mommy.
- What?

357
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:07,020
- You cursed.
- Put your shoes on, OK?

358
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,600
OK.

359
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:17,730
- Do you need help with those?
- Yeah.

360
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:21,490
Pick up your finger paints
from the back of the room.

361
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:24,950
Remember to mix the colors.
Red and yellow make...

362
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:28,040
- Orange.
- Great.

363
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,710
Good morning. Hi.

364
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:34,500
Hi, Cecilia. You know what?
We are gonna have so much fun today.

365
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:36,960
We're finger-painting,
so we're gonna get all messy. Look. See?

366
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:39,920
- The messier the better.
- That's fine.

367
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:42,300
Are you ready to come
meet all your new friends?

368
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:45,470
Great. Why don't you come with me,
sweetheart?

369
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:47,810
- Bye, sweetheart.
- Wanna say goodbye to your mama?

370
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:50,060
Bye, darling girl.

371
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:54,600
- I'll be here at 3:30 to pick you up.
- Love you, Mommy.

372
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:57,650
Oh, I love you so much.
Go have fun.

373
00:23:57,730 --> 00:23:59,900
Come on, sweetheart.

374
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,240
OK, everybody.
Listen up, now.

375
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:12,960
I want you to give a big, warm, huge
welcome to our new friend Cecilia.

376
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:19,000
- Hi, Cecilia.
- Hi, everybody. I'm Cecilia.

377
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:22,170
Hi, Cecilia.

378
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,720
Wow, that was great.

379
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:06,220
- You want the elevator?
- Uh... Actually, I was looking for you. Um...

380
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:08,970
There's a leak
in my bedroom ceiling.

381
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:11,260
Breaking news, huh?

382
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:15,390
Pipes is 30 years old.
Leaks all over the building.

383
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:19,980
So does that mean
you won't fix it?

384
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:24,820
Fix a leak? Look,
all I can do is patch up the ceiling.

385
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:28,030
If you wanna fix the leak,
you gotta get Murray to call a plumber.

386
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,200
- Mr. Murray.
- Mr. Murray.

387
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:32,540
OK. I'll call him.

388
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:35,000
Do.

389
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,750
OK.

390
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:46,630
So, you worked
as a copy editor?

391
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:50,550
Yeah. Back in Seattle,
I did copy editing and some fact checking.

392
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:54,310
Why do you want this job? Pay's
not that good, sure as hell ain't interesting.

393
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:58,400
Oh, I'd try something different, you know?
I've always been interested in medicine.

394
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:01,690
Medicine?
Oh, honey, this ain't medicine.

395
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:05,070
See, what you do is you Xerox
their insurance card, hand them a form,

396
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:09,360
and give them
a pitcher of bug-juice to drink.

397
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:11,830
Are you sure
you wanna do this?

398
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:18,790
Come on, you can tell me.
I'm not exactly a model citizen.

399
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:23,960
I'm separated from my husband.

400
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:27,380
My daughter and I
just moved to Roosevelt Island.

401
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:29,890
You're a five-minute subway ride,

402
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:34,350
the hours are perfect,
and you have a medical plan.

403
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:40,480
Well, you're hired, honey.
But you gotta promise me one thing.

404
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:40,980
What?

405
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:44,070
In six months' time,
when you find a better job,

406
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:46,570
please take me with you.

407
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:49,450
OK. Thank you.

408
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:51,950
- Hello.
- Hi. Mr. Murray?

409
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:54,330
- Yeah.
- Hi. It's Dahlia Williams.

410
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:56,450
- Dahlia Williams.
- From 9F.

411
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:57,870
- 9F.
- Yeah.

412
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,160
Hey,
how was that paint job?

413
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:00,370
- Yeah...
- Great work, right?

414
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:05,000
Thank you, but, um... Actually,
I have a leak in my bedroom ceiling.

415
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:06,590
- A leak?
- Yeah.

416
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:07,840
Did you tell Mr. Veeck?

417
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,720
I did, I told him.
He said that he could patch the ceiling,

418
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:13,510
but that to repair the leak,
you would need to call a plumber.

419
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,100
I don't know
what he's talking about.

420
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:17,350
If he needs to open the ceiling
and fix the pipe, he can do it.

421
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:20,310
He doesn't need a plumber.
Listen up.

422
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:25,900
Just tell him I said... Just tell him
Mr. Murray said that he should fix the leak.

423
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,780
OK. I'll... I'll try.

424
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:30,820
Listen, say hello
to little Cathy for me, too, OK?

425
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:32,160
Ceci.

426
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,530
Ceci. I'm sorry.

427
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:34,490
OK.

428
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:37,540
OK. Bye-bye.

429
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:51,970
Yes!

430
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:07,110
- Hi.
- It's lunch hour.

431
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:09,190
Just quickly.
I spoke to Mr. Murray,

432
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,860
and he said that you should
fix that leak that I told you about.

433
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:15,490
Look, I'm not a plumber.
I keep telling him.

434
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:17,620
I'm not responsible
for building's plumbing.

435
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:19,830
My job is make sure
boiler's working,

436
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:22,250
mop floors, put out the garbage,
but I'm not a plumber.

437
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:25,960
No, I understand. It's just Murray said
that you could fix it.

438
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,210
Well, I can't.

439
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:30,320
- Hello.
- Wouldn't stop, right? Took you up to ten?

440
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:33,150
Yeah, it does that sometimes. It just
goes up to ten, no one's even called for it.

441
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:36,490
I think when it rains a lot, it messes with
the contacts or something. Which floor?

442
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:38,410
- Nine, please.
- OK, we'll take you back up,

443
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:39,570
and then I'll go down.

444
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:41,240
OK. Thank you.

445
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:43,410
Shit. Come on.

446
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,210
Who did this?

447
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:52,500
This building is falling apart.

448
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:59,550
- Bye.
- See ya later.

449
00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:53,960
I've talked to Veeck
twice now,

450
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,380
and he says he's not a plumber
and he can't fix it,

451
00:31:56,460 --> 00:32:00,260
so I'm wondering, is there a super from
one of the other buildings who could do it?

452
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:03,510
I can't do that.
See, C is Veeck, and Veeck is C.

453
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:08,520
If I do that, then I have the union screaming
at me about violating work rules.

454
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:13,520
It's really coming down now, and I can
hear there's running water upstairs, so...

455
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:16,480
You know, it might not even be a leak.
It might be flooded or something.

456
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:19,480
- Did you say "upstairs"?
- Right above me.

457
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:21,280
- In 10F?
- Upstairs.

458
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:24,530
You know, maybe it's their tub that's
overflowed or something, I don't know.

459
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:25,820
No, that can't be right.

460
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:28,990
Listen, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna call Mr. Veeck personally, OK?

461
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,200
I'm gonna take care of this.

462
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:32,540
So don't worry about it.
I'm gonna get right on it.

463
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:36,590
I'm sorry, I'm with a client right now. I'll call
you later, as soon as I take care of it, OK?

464
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:39,670
- Thank you.
- OK. No problem. Bye-bye.

465
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:28,300
Mommy, wake up.

466
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:31,970
Ceci?

467
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:08,590
Hello.

468
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,400
Hello.

469
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:41,670
Hello.

470
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:34,760
Oh, God.

471
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:36,970
Oh, God.

472
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:49,320
What are you doing here?

473
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,700
Take it easy.

474
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:53,490
It's flooded.

475
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:56,700
The fuckin' brats.
I'm gonna kill 'em.

476
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:58,790
- You see them coming outta here?
- Who?

477
00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:03,710
Asshole Steve. 3F.
And his buddy, dumb Billy, 7E.

478
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:05,250
- You don't know them?
- No.

479
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:07,500
Look.
Here's the story.

480
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:11,510
10F's away.
Father's left the country.

481
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:14,140
Where the mother is,
God knows.

482
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:18,890
They've been away for months.
Probably not coming back.

483
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:21,020
Those punks have stolen a key
and get in here.

484
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:22,980
- Why?
- What do I know?

485
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:26,770
Drugs.
Wacky baccy, you know.

486
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:30,990
Look, I clean up this place, and then...
Then I come down to your place, huh?

487
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:34,570
Murray called me.
I tell him I take care of it.

488
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:50,090
Yeah. I patch it up tomorrow,
when it's dry.

489
00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:52,220
- No extra charge, you know?
- Thank you.

490
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:56,140
The itsy-bitsy spider

491
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:59,470
- Went up the waterspout
- Then what?

492
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,600
Down came the rain

493
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,810
- And it washed the spider out
- OK.

494
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:04,810
- It's OK.
- Sorry.

495
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:07,020
You can be 10,
even 15 minutes late.

496
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:10,440
We have this after-school program
that runs until 5:30, so...

497
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:13,610
- Many of the kids stay for it.
- Uh... Is there a charge for that?

498
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:16,490
It's $30 a week.

499
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:19,280
- Which is actually quite reasonable.
- No, that's good. That's good.

500
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:22,500
I think I'll have to do that,
cos I'll be working till five every day.

501
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:24,580
- OK. Well, we can set that up.
- OK.

502
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:29,380
Surprise, surprise, there's another form
you have to fill out, but we can do that now.

503
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:31,090
This will be good for Cecilia.

504
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:35,590
It will help her fit in faster, and she could
use some real friends, don't you think?

505
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:36,590
What do you mean?

506
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:39,970
Well, it's not unusual
to have imaginary friends at this age.

507
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:41,930
Nowadays we know
not to bug them about it,

508
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:46,440
but it isn't so great
that she's playing with an imaginary friend

509
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,980
when there are real children
for her to play with here.

510
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:51,940
Are you saying
that Ceci has an imaginary friend?

511
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:54,320
And washed the spider out

512
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:59,240
Out came the sun
and dried up all the rain

513
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:02,540
And the itsy-bitsy spider

514
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:06,750
Went up the spout again

515
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:10,000
I made you a snack for after school.
I had it all wrapped up and ready to go,

516
00:38:10,090 --> 00:38:11,960
and then I was rushing,
and I forgot it.

517
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:14,090
- It's OK.
- Sorry.

518
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:17,930
- What did you think of your teacher?
- She was very nice.

519
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:20,470
- Did you make any friends today?
- Uh-huh.

520
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,390
Who?

521
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:24,980
- Nobody.
- Nobody?

522
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:26,810
Very funny name
for a friend, "Nobody. "

523
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:29,400
- Mommy.
- Nobody. "My name is Nobody. "

524
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:36,650
- Did anyone come?
- What?

525
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:38,910
For Hello Kitty.
Did anyone come?

526
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:40,740
No. Not yet.

527
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:43,240
Thanks for taking care of the ceiling
tomorrow. I appreciate it.

528
00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:45,700
It looks really ugly now.

529
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:47,410
Good.

530
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,960
Are you gonna stay
in my bed tonight?

531
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:52,590
Close your eyes.

532
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,220
I'm very proud of you
for today.

533
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:02,600
Sweet dreams, honey.

534
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:18,780
The itsy-bitsy spider

535
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:23,120
Went up the waterspout

536
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:27,910
Down came the rain

537
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,580
And washed the spider out

538
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:35,170
Out came the sun

539
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:38,670
And dried up all the rain

540
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:43,600
- The itsy-bitsy spider
- Itsy-bitsy spider...

541
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:48,520
- Went up the spout again
- ... the spout again

542
00:39:50,770 --> 00:39:55,070
Well, I still don't really know anyone here,
so I'm not really sure who to ask.

543
00:39:55,190 --> 00:40:01,070
Except Bill and Stacy, but he's
Kyle's friend from work, so I can't ask him.

544
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,030
I think it'd be a lot easier for her
back there in Seattle, you know?

545
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:07,450
Well, what about the mediators?
Maybe they can recommend somebody.

546
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:10,040
Yeah, I asked them,
but they're supposed to be impartial

547
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:13,500
- so they can't recommend anyone.
- Oh.

548
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:18,050
I don't know. I guess maybe I'll try and
find someone out of the Yellow Pages.

549
00:40:18,130 --> 00:40:23,590
Dahlia, you can't pick some
random lawyer out of a phone book.

550
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,260
I can't believe it.
Those kids are up there again.

551
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:28,060
What?

552
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:29,980
Mary, I'm gonna have
to call you back later, OK?

553
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:32,480
I have to go downstairs
and deal with this.

554
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,350
- All right. I'll talk to you later. Bye.
- Bye.

555
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:41,610
Stop it. She'll catch you.

556
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:45,660
No, I'm not allowed to go to the roof.

557
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:50,250
Cos it's dangerous,
and by the ways, it's spooky at night.

558
00:40:51,330 --> 00:40:54,580
- Who are you talking to?
- Nobody.

559
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:59,800
Is it your friend Nobody again?

560
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:11,390
Do you have an invisible friend
only you can see?

561
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:17,440
Is it a boy or a girl?

562
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,570
Girl.

563
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:23,820
- How old is she?
- My age. Almost exactly.

564
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:27,990
She was born a month before me.
So she's older.

565
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:31,200
Wow. What's her name?

566
00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:34,620
- Natasha.
- Natasha?

567
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:39,250
That's a really interesting name.
Where'd you get that name from?

568
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:41,510
It's just her name.

569
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:43,720
Night, Mom.

570
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:49,890
I can't go up to 10F now. If I leave my post
and Mr. Murray finds out, I'm dead.

571
00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:53,480
OK, but if they leave the water running
then my bedroom ceiling could collapse.

572
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,560
- Understand?
- Yeah, I understand.

573
00:41:55,690 --> 00:41:57,520
But what you gotta understand
is if I leave now

574
00:41:57,650 --> 00:42:00,070
I might as well go straight to
Unemployment. That's not gonna happen.

575
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:03,530
Look, I'm sorry. I don't know if
you want me to call the cops or something.

576
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:06,990
- Just give me a second. Hang on.
- It's all right, never mind.

577
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:10,370
I'll deal with it. And thanks for your help.

578
00:42:10,490 --> 00:42:12,370
All right.

579
00:43:06,090 --> 00:43:08,880
Mommy, come.

580
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:04,110
Are you OK?

581
00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:06,570
Can I help you?

582
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:16,580
I told you. I told you to leave me alone.

583
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:20,210
Mom?

584
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:24,250
- Get away from me, you little bitch.
- Mommy?

585
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:27,630
- I hate you.
- Let me help you.

586
00:44:27,710 --> 00:44:30,340
I hate you.

587
00:44:30,470 --> 00:44:34,760
- Do you hear me? I hate you.
- No.

588
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,220
Just go! Go!

589
00:44:45,230 --> 00:44:47,360
Mommy.

590
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:48,730
Wh...

591
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:51,190
- What?
- You're scaring me.

592
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:56,070
- What's wrong?
- You were having a bad dream again.

593
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,540
Again?

594
00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:01,410
You always make that sound
when you sleep.

595
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:03,080
I do?

596
00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:05,210
Ever since Daddy left.

597
00:45:05,330 --> 00:45:07,500
- Stop doing that, OK?
- OK.

598
00:45:07,590 --> 00:45:12,260
- It scares me.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

599
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:14,510
It's OK.

600
00:45:15,510 --> 00:45:17,720
There's nothing to be scared of.

601
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:51,920
- Have a good day. See you later.
- OK. Bye, Mommy.

602
00:45:56,890 --> 00:45:59,350
Yeah, he was a frat brother
of Joe's at Wash U.

603
00:45:59,470 --> 00:46:01,140
Joe says he's as smart as a whip.

604
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:03,600
If he was at college with Joe
I guess he's been practicing for a while.

605
00:46:03,730 --> 00:46:06,140
Well, actually, he got a late start
on being a lawyer.

606
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:08,560
- He lost a decade to partying.
- A decade?

607
00:46:08,650 --> 00:46:10,570
No, seriously, Joe says he's really good

608
00:46:10,650 --> 00:46:12,480
and he won't charge you
an arm and a leg.

609
00:46:12,570 --> 00:46:14,990
- His name is Platzer.
- OK.

610
00:46:15,070 --> 00:46:17,200
- P-L-A...
- Right.

611
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:18,820
...T-Z-E-R.

612
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:23,370
Come on, Platz.
This mess was sloppy, unprofessional.

613
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:27,120
I mean, I know I get caught,
but my work? My craft?

614
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:29,920
My craft ain't sloppy.

615
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,920
That much is true.

616
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,710
- Thank you.
- Hello?

617
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:35,880
Mr. Platzer, hi.
My name is Dahlia Williams.

618
00:46:36,010 --> 00:46:39,340
Hi, Mrs. Williams.
John told me you'd be calling.

619
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:43,470
I can't meet till next week, so you give me
opposing counsel's name and number

620
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:46,270
and I'll give him a call
and get up to speed on their issues.

621
00:46:46,350 --> 00:46:49,020
Sure. My husband's lawyer's name
is Carrie Simmons.

622
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:52,480
That's OK, I know Carrie's number.
This is not gonna be so easy.

623
00:46:52,610 --> 00:46:55,820
We should meet Monday. Where do you
work? I'll come by in your lunch hour.

624
00:46:55,940 --> 00:47:00,450
It's Sutton Place Radiology.
585 East 58th Street.

625
00:47:00,530 --> 00:47:03,870
You're being very nice,
but I'm sorry, I just have to ask.

626
00:47:03,950 --> 00:47:07,000
- How much is that gonna cost me?
- We'll figure the money out.

627
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:10,170
I'll call Carrie, get up to speed,
then we'll go over everything Monday,

628
00:47:10,290 --> 00:47:13,460
- including my fee, OK?
- OK. Thanks so much.

629
00:47:13,550 --> 00:47:15,880
- OK. Bye.
- Bye-bye.

630
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:19,970
Figure the money out? That's some
sweet thing you're figuring money for.

631
00:47:20,050 --> 00:47:24,930
- You gonna figure my money too?
- You're lucky I don't charge you double.

632
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:27,930
OK, so everyone looking at me.
And do you all have a piece of tape?

633
00:47:28,060 --> 00:47:30,480
Show me, show me. Put it somewhere silly.

634
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:33,480
Somewhere silly. Your forehead,
your nose. Make a beard. OK.

635
00:47:33,570 --> 00:47:35,690
Now put it on the back of your picture

636
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:38,490
and then you're gonna follow me into the
hallway cos we're gonna put them up.

637
00:47:38,570 --> 00:47:44,280
Ten, nine, eight, a-seven, a-six,
five, four, three, two, one.

638
00:47:44,410 --> 00:47:47,080
Beautiful.

639
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:49,160
- Anyone else need tape?
- I do.

640
00:47:49,250 --> 00:47:50,870
If it's not sticking...

641
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,080
- Mom, you're early.
- I know.

642
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:55,500
The subway was so much faster
than the Tram.

643
00:47:55,590 --> 00:47:58,010
I was at work ten minutes ago.
Isn't that amazing?

644
00:47:58,090 --> 00:48:02,050
- I think we picked the perfect place to live.
- Daddy doesn't like it here.

645
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:05,180
He wants me to move with him
to that other city.

646
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:06,350
Oh.

647
00:48:06,430 --> 00:48:08,060
- When did Daddy say that?
- Today.

648
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:11,980
He came to see
what my new school was like.

649
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:13,060
Hm.

650
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:15,440
- I gotta go.
- OK. I'll be waiting for you.

651
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:17,780
OK.

652
00:48:18,690 --> 00:48:22,530
Yeah, he came by to give us his cell phone
number in case of an emergency.

653
00:48:22,610 --> 00:48:28,410
He was with Cecilia for a few minutes.
He said hi, he looked at the room.

654
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:32,210
Is there some problem?
Is he not allowed to?

655
00:48:32,290 --> 00:48:34,290
Is there some restraining order
against him?

656
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:37,800
No. No.

657
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:41,420
I was just... wondering if Ceci was...

658
00:48:41,550 --> 00:48:44,010
Still imagining things?

659
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:48,470
Actually, I'm glad you brought that up.
Her imaginary friend hasn't gone away.

660
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:52,060
In fact, she threw somewhat of a tantrum
during circle time

661
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:54,400
when we wouldn't let her "friend"
sing along.

662
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:57,020
I had to have her take a time-out.

663
00:48:57,150 --> 00:49:02,320
I'm sorry. I'll certainly
talk to Ceci about that.

664
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:05,490
You know, the PTA provides
a psychologist, Katie Shoettle.

665
00:49:05,570 --> 00:49:09,740
She's very nice. She comes every
Wednesday. It's absolutely no charge.

666
00:49:09,830 --> 00:49:14,040
I'll talk to Ceci about it. It'll stop.
I'm really sorry about that.

667
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:18,000
You'll see. Couple of days, blend right in.

668
00:49:18,090 --> 00:49:20,550
You won't see the difference.

669
00:49:21,510 --> 00:49:24,550
I'm sure you're right. Thank you.

670
00:49:26,090 --> 00:49:29,680
You know, those kids were up there
again last night, running around,

671
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:32,520
and I could hear them running water. So...

672
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:34,060
You know what I'm gonna do?

673
00:49:34,190 --> 00:49:37,860
I'm gonna speak with Murray
about changing the lock on 10F.

674
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:40,900
You know what he told me?
Rimsky paid no rent this month.

675
00:49:41,030 --> 00:49:43,450
- He's probably not coming back anyway.
- OK.

676
00:49:43,530 --> 00:49:46,070
Well, that would be great
if you could change the lock.

677
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:48,660
Starting to have nightmares
about what's going on up there.

678
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:52,370
- Really? You gotta relax, huh?
- Can I get you something before you go?

679
00:49:52,450 --> 00:49:55,500
Yeah. Get me a reward
for all this hard work I've been doing.

680
00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:58,130
Yeah? I think I have beer.

681
00:49:58,210 --> 00:50:00,550
- You want a beer?
- I don't drink beer.

682
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:02,800
Coffee? I could make a pot of coffee
if you want.

683
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:06,380
Oh, forget it. I've been working hard today.
I'm tired. I'm going.

684
00:50:06,470 --> 00:50:07,720
OK. Well, thank you.

685
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:10,140
What about Hello Kitty? Can I have it now?

686
00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:13,350
Oh, so sorry, kid.
Somebody came by for it today.

687
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:16,310
They were visiting town,
left it there by accident.

688
00:50:16,390 --> 00:50:20,020
Oh, that little girl,
she was so happy to have it back.

689
00:50:20,570 --> 00:50:22,190
- You're lying.
- Ceci.

690
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:24,990
He's lying, Mommy. Nobody came.

691
00:50:25,070 --> 00:50:27,410
You want to teach that goddamn brat
some manners, lady.

692
00:50:27,490 --> 00:50:29,910
Sorry.

693
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:32,870
What is the matter with you?

694
00:50:32,990 --> 00:50:33,870
Mm.

695
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,870
Mac and cheese. My favorite.
I love you, Mommy.

696
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,340
I love you too, sweetheart.
I love you very much.

697
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:43,300
But, you know, it was very wrong of you
to call Mr. Veeck a liar.

698
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:47,180
- You know that, don't you?
- He is a liar.

699
00:50:47,260 --> 00:50:50,550
Ceci. You don't know that he's a liar.

700
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:53,060
- Yes, I do.
- How? How do you know that?

701
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:58,190
Natasha told me he still had
the Hello Kitty backpack in his desk.

702
00:50:58,270 --> 00:51:00,730
I want to talk to you
about your imaginary friend, OK?

703
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:04,530
- She's not imaginary.
- She's not?

704
00:51:04,610 --> 00:51:09,160
She's lost. Her mommy forgot about her
and now she's lost.

705
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:12,580
Like you.

706
00:51:13,950 --> 00:51:18,620
- What are you talking about?
- Your mommy forgot about you, right?

707
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:21,750
Did someone tell you that?

708
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:25,590
- You did.
- No.

709
00:51:25,710 --> 00:51:28,970
I didn't tell you that, Ceci.

710
00:51:29,050 --> 00:51:31,890
Who told you that?

711
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:38,020
Are you gonna answer me?
I'm asking you a question.

712
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:40,480
- Who told you?
- Natasha told me.

713
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:44,070
Stop it. You stop lying to me.

714
00:51:44,150 --> 00:51:46,360
Who told you?

715
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:49,860
Who told you?

716
00:51:49,990 --> 00:51:52,530
Who told you?

717
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:01,960
- Hello?
- Hi, I'm just calling to arrange...

718
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:07,090
What are you trying to do? Sneaking into
her school, telling her it isn't any good?

719
00:52:07,170 --> 00:52:10,430
Talking to her about my mother?
How dare you talk to her about my mother.

720
00:52:10,510 --> 00:52:14,260
Look, I don't know who or what pressed
your wacko button today, and I don't care,

721
00:52:14,350 --> 00:52:17,060
I'm calling to tell you I'm picking up Ceci
Saturday at nine.

722
00:52:17,180 --> 00:52:20,810
I'll bring her back Sunday at six.
Don't play any games.

723
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:23,190
Have her there, 9am sharp.

724
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:55,680
- I tell you punks. No skating in here.
- Yeah, yeah.

725
00:52:58,310 --> 00:53:01,230
She's cute.

726
00:53:01,890 --> 00:53:04,230
Daddy's here!

727
00:53:04,310 --> 00:53:06,360
Hey!

728
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:08,400
Look at you.

729
00:53:09,730 --> 00:53:11,780
You shouldn't be smoking, Daddy.

730
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:13,990
I'm gonna quit real soon, honey. I promise.

731
00:53:14,070 --> 00:53:18,660
- Thank you, Daddy.
- Satisfied?

732
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:21,870
As far as I'm concerned,
you can smoke as much as you like, Kyle.

733
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,920
Honey.

734
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,630
- I'll bring her back tomorrow at six.
- OK.

735
00:53:26,750 --> 00:53:29,210
- Bye, Mommy.
- Bye, honey.

736
00:54:05,210 --> 00:54:08,040
Hey, pretty lady. What's happening?

737
00:54:08,130 --> 00:54:10,920
Laundry. Excuse me.

738
00:54:11,050 --> 00:54:14,510
I got some dirty things I'd like you to clean.

739
00:55:09,860 --> 00:55:12,020
Sorry.

740
00:55:13,190 --> 00:55:15,650
I forgot my smokes.

741
00:57:27,990 --> 00:57:30,200
Help!

742
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:37,500
Smart-ass kids.
Steve and Billy. They did this.

743
00:57:37,590 --> 00:57:41,880
You'll see. Monday, the plumbers come.
They'll find something stuck in there.

744
00:57:42,010 --> 00:57:44,220
They gum 'em up. Brats.

745
00:57:45,260 --> 00:57:47,600
- Who's Natasha?
- What?

746
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:50,850
Who's Natasha Rimsky?

747
00:57:50,930 --> 00:57:54,390
Little girl. 10F.

748
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:59,110
- Where is she now?
- How do I know? With her mother, I guess.

749
00:57:59,190 --> 00:58:01,780
Couldn't stand living
with that crazy Russian husband of hers.

750
00:58:01,860 --> 00:58:06,160
Took the little girl with her.
That Russki, he was a piece of work.

751
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:10,910
Always "blyad".

752
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:13,580
Look, there's a Laundromat
down the block.

753
00:58:13,710 --> 00:58:18,540
I'll get you some garbage bags
so you don't get wet carrying them there.

754
00:59:23,530 --> 00:59:30,570
The itsy-bitsy spider
climbed up the water spout

755
01:00:02,650 --> 01:00:04,780
Hi, Mommy.

756
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:11,450
Glad you like spaghetti and meatballs.

757
01:00:11,570 --> 01:00:15,240
- It's my favorite.
- Your favorite?

758
01:00:15,330 --> 01:00:18,120
I love them, Mommy.

759
01:00:18,250 --> 01:00:20,500
I'm glad.

760
01:00:20,580 --> 01:00:22,460
Mm.

761
01:00:23,340 --> 01:00:25,750
I love you, Mommy.

762
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:28,340
You haven't said anything
about what your dad's new place is like.

763
01:00:28,420 --> 01:00:29,510
- I don't like it.
- Really?

764
01:00:29,590 --> 01:00:30,680
Yeah.

765
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:32,720
Well, maybe it's just new
and you need to get used to it.

766
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:35,060
But I don't wanna get used to it.

767
01:00:35,180 --> 01:00:40,230
I don't wanna stay with Daddy.
I only wanna stay with you.

768
01:00:40,940 --> 01:00:46,020
Well, your dad loves you. He'll be happy
that you spent this time with him.

769
01:00:46,110 --> 01:00:51,950
Itsy-bitsy spider
climbed up the water spout

770
01:00:52,030 --> 01:00:54,450
Down came the rain

771
01:00:54,530 --> 01:00:58,330
- Honey, can you stop singing that?
- Why? It happened.

772
01:00:58,450 --> 01:01:01,120
I want to go to bed now, Mommy. I'm tired.

773
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:14,140
- Mommy?
- Mm?

774
01:01:14,220 --> 01:01:17,720
I'm scared, Mommy.
I want to sleep with you.

775
01:01:17,810 --> 01:01:19,930
Yeah.

776
01:01:33,740 --> 01:01:38,120
I love you, Mommy.
Thank you for taking care of me.

777
01:02:05,690 --> 01:02:07,730
Ceci?

778
01:02:17,620 --> 01:02:20,830
- Hello?
- Mommy, where were you?

779
01:02:20,950 --> 01:02:24,750
- I was napping.
- No, not now. Last night.

780
01:02:24,870 --> 01:02:29,960
Where were you last night? I called
two times for you to say goodnight to me.

781
01:02:30,050 --> 01:02:32,670
- Where were you?
- Last night?

782
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:37,970
OK, Daddy. Daddy says he's bringing
me home a half an hour early.

783
01:02:38,050 --> 01:02:40,560
OK, Daddy. 5:30.

784
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:43,230
He says to be there in the lobby at 5:30.

785
01:02:43,310 --> 01:02:45,480
- Don't fall asleep again, Mommy.
- OK.

786
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:48,270
I gotta go. I'm getting chocolate cake.

787
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:50,020
- Bye.
- Bye.

788
01:02:50,570 --> 01:02:52,730
Dahlia, where have you been?
I left two messages.

789
01:02:52,820 --> 01:02:55,240
I lost a day, Mary.

790
01:02:55,320 --> 01:03:00,490
I took a pill, just one pill,
and it knocked me out for 24 hours.

791
01:03:00,580 --> 01:03:02,410
That's never happened before.

792
01:03:02,490 --> 01:03:08,000
And I'm tired, really tired.
It's like I haven't slept at all.

793
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:12,130
Dahlia, are you OK? Are you really OK?

794
01:03:12,250 --> 01:03:15,800
My headache's gone. But the leak is back.

795
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:20,100
It's back?
I thought they were gonna fix that thing.

796
01:03:21,100 --> 01:03:23,470
- Dahlia?
- Yeah?

797
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:27,980
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

798
01:03:28,690 --> 01:03:32,020
You have five new messages.
First new message.

799
01:03:32,110 --> 01:03:35,280
Long nap, huh? Call me.

800
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:37,700
Message erased.
Next message.

801
01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:41,410
Hi, Jeff Platzer here. I got the preliminaries
from your husband's lawyer

802
01:03:41,530 --> 01:03:44,790
and I need to touch base with you about
his accusations as soon as possible.

803
01:03:44,870 --> 01:03:48,290
Believe it or not I'm actually available
on Sunday afternoon until five.

804
01:03:48,370 --> 01:03:51,840
If you are, would you call my cell?
OK. Bye.

805
01:04:01,300 --> 01:04:03,390
- Mrs. Williams?
- Yeah.

806
01:04:03,470 --> 01:04:06,060
Hi. I'm your lawyer.

807
01:04:06,140 --> 01:04:08,560
- Hi.
- Hi.

808
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:11,900
- I'm sorry it's such a mess.
- No, it's OK.

809
01:04:11,980 --> 01:04:15,400
I just moved into a new office
and they've painted it.

810
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:18,070
I can't stand the smell so I'm improvising.

811
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:21,320
OK.

812
01:04:25,910 --> 01:04:29,330
- Hi.
- Hi.

813
01:04:29,410 --> 01:04:32,880
- So...
- OK.

814
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:37,460
Your husband's claiming
you're mentally unstable

815
01:04:37,590 --> 01:04:40,090
because your father
was physically abusive

816
01:04:40,180 --> 01:04:43,850
and your mother was an alcoholic
who abandoned you.

817
01:04:43,930 --> 01:04:46,010
That's...

818
01:04:47,930 --> 01:04:50,230
unbelievable.

819
01:04:50,350 --> 01:04:54,440
- What do my parents have to do with this?
- That's my question exactly.

820
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:59,320
What's more relevant is that your husband
says you suffer from crippling migraines

821
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:01,610
and paranoid delusions.

822
01:05:01,700 --> 01:05:03,070
He says he'll submit school reports

823
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:06,740
that show your daughter
is beginning to share your fantasy life.

824
01:05:06,870 --> 01:05:08,370
"Cecilia is now having trouble

825
01:05:08,450 --> 01:05:10,830
distinguishing between
what is real and what is not. "

826
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:12,870
It's a lie. It's a lie.

827
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:15,880
In child custody briefs, it's standard
to make these kinds of accusations.

828
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:17,380
Don't take it too seriously.

829
01:05:17,460 --> 01:05:21,470
But I do need to know what, if anything,
in your husband's narrative

830
01:05:21,550 --> 01:05:26,970
has some semblance, some shred of fact
that he might produce in court.

831
01:05:27,060 --> 01:05:31,440
Well, I get migraines.
Yeah. That's true.

832
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:35,770
But they've never interfered
with my ability to do anything.

833
01:05:35,900 --> 01:05:41,360
You can talk to my doctor about that. He'll
tell you they've certainly never crippled me.

834
01:05:41,490 --> 01:05:42,950
Um...

835
01:05:43,070 --> 01:05:48,120
As for Ceci, I think
she's a little bit lonely right now.

836
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:51,410
Her father's abandoned her and she was
forced to move from her neighborhood.

837
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:53,920
So...

838
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:58,630
she's developed an imaginary friend.
But that's normal.

839
01:06:00,340 --> 01:06:05,430
That's fine. But for future reference, when
you're talking to, for example, a judge,

840
01:06:05,510 --> 01:06:08,220
I would stay away from phrases like,
"her father's abandoned her".

841
01:06:08,350 --> 01:06:11,350
It's important, when the other side
is being so melodramatic,

842
01:06:11,430 --> 01:06:14,900
- to sound like we're the sane ones.
- Right.

843
01:06:15,020 --> 01:06:17,610
- That's all I'm saying.
- OK.

844
01:06:37,380 --> 01:06:39,920
- I'd like to notch that.
- Oh, yeah, man.

845
01:06:47,550 --> 01:06:49,720
Hey, sweetheart.

846
01:06:52,970 --> 01:06:53,890
- Mommy?
- Yeah.

847
01:06:53,980 --> 01:06:57,480
- Look what Daddy gave me.
- Wow.

848
01:06:57,560 --> 01:07:02,530
- That's great, You're so lucky.
- Listen, next Saturday's a problem.

849
01:07:02,650 --> 01:07:04,610
Can we do Sunday and I'll bring her
first thing in the morning

850
01:07:04,740 --> 01:07:06,990
for school on Monday?

851
01:07:07,070 --> 01:07:09,990
Yeah. Yeah, that's fine.

852
01:07:11,490 --> 01:07:15,210
- Come on, honey. Say bye to Daddy.
- Bye, Daddy. Thanks for the Barbie.

853
01:07:15,330 --> 01:07:18,040
- Did you do that ponytail by yourself?
- Yeah.

854
01:07:18,170 --> 01:07:20,590
- It's a good one.
- Thanks.

855
01:07:26,090 --> 01:07:28,590
- I like the collar.
- Thanks.

856
01:07:33,430 --> 01:07:35,980
Honey, you know what,
I forgot to do something.

857
01:07:36,100 --> 01:07:38,270
I'm gonna be right back.
Will you wait right here for me?

858
01:07:38,350 --> 01:07:40,480
- Don't go anywhere, OK?
- OK.

859
01:07:40,610 --> 01:07:41,610
Be right back.

860
01:07:41,690 --> 01:07:45,400
Two... one.

861
01:08:20,310 --> 01:08:22,310
Ceci?

862
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:27,360
Ceci? Stay in the elevator.
I'm bringing you down.

863
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:32,370
Ceci, can you hear me?

864
01:08:37,660 --> 01:08:42,460
Bake me a cake as fast as you can.
Roll it, pat it and mark it with a B.

865
01:08:42,580 --> 01:08:46,210
- No more pretending to play with Natasha.
- She won't let me.

866
01:08:46,340 --> 01:08:49,880
Well, then you stop talking to her.
You tell her I said so.

867
01:08:50,010 --> 01:08:53,140
You tell her your mommy said
you can't play with her any more.

868
01:08:53,260 --> 01:08:55,510
OK, Mommy.

869
01:09:00,770 --> 01:09:02,480
- Hello?
- Hi, Mr. Platzer.

870
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:05,690
I'm sorry to call you late,
but I think my husband...

871
01:09:05,770 --> 01:09:07,780
Mrs. Williams, it's Sunday night.
I can't talk.

872
01:09:07,860 --> 01:09:11,910
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry. I just need
to tell you this as soon as possible.

873
01:09:12,030 --> 01:09:14,120
I think my husband
is trying to drive me crazy.

874
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:16,160
Either that or he's hoping
that I'm gonna act crazy.

875
01:09:16,280 --> 01:09:20,000
- Hang on. Let me call you right back.
- OK.

876
01:09:21,710 --> 01:09:23,960
You say neither of the Rimskys
are living there?

877
01:09:24,040 --> 01:09:26,380
No, no one's there.
So Kyle's paying these kids.

878
01:09:26,460 --> 01:09:28,130
I mean, he must be paying these kids

879
01:09:28,210 --> 01:09:31,090
to mess around with the water
and the backpack. And the elevator.

880
01:09:31,220 --> 01:09:34,680
I went into the elevator the other day
and the buttons were burned off.

881
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:37,890
Mrs. Williams, it's Sunday night
and I'm at the movies with my family.

882
01:09:37,970 --> 01:09:41,890
If I don't want to be handling
my own divorce, I gotta get back. So...

883
01:09:41,980 --> 01:09:44,230
I'll call you tomorrow
and we'll sort this out. All right?

884
01:09:44,310 --> 01:09:45,730
Yeah. Absolutely.

885
01:09:51,490 --> 01:09:53,860
Get down!

886
01:10:18,350 --> 01:10:21,350
This time make sure
you put it in the garbage truck.

887
01:10:21,430 --> 01:10:23,560
- Where did you...
- Those kids have been playing games,

888
01:10:23,690 --> 01:10:25,230
moving it around the building.

889
01:10:25,350 --> 01:10:29,570
And they were upstairs again so now
there's water all over my bedroom floor.

890
01:10:29,690 --> 01:10:31,740
- They're running the water again?
- Mm-hm.

891
01:10:31,860 --> 01:10:33,860
I thought you were gonna
change the lock on 10F.

892
01:10:33,950 --> 01:10:37,450
Murray didn't authorize it.
He has to send me a 112B form.

893
01:10:37,530 --> 01:10:41,240
- Look, is the plumber here yet?
- No, no. It's only 8:15.

894
01:10:41,370 --> 01:10:45,870
OK, look. I left a message for Mr. Murray.
I told him I need my problem fixed first.

895
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:48,630
So when the plumber gets here,
send him up to my apartment

896
01:10:48,710 --> 01:10:52,760
or you and Murray
can both talk to my lawyer. OK?

897
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:08,980
Do you remember
what we talked about last night?

898
01:11:09,060 --> 01:11:12,230
- Yes, Mommy.
- OK.

899
01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:16,950
See you later, OK?

900
01:11:18,160 --> 01:11:20,120
- Hello.
- Hi. Jeff Platzer here.

901
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:23,330
- Hi, Mr. Platzer.
- Listen, I did a little homework on Rimsky

902
01:11:23,450 --> 01:11:26,210
and I think I turned up the missing mother
in a hospital in San Diego.

903
01:11:26,330 --> 01:11:27,460
Why are you looking for her?

904
01:11:27,580 --> 01:11:31,170
I figured the Rimskys might want to know
their apartment's being used by strangers.

905
01:11:31,290 --> 01:11:34,260
Mrs. Williams, we're never gonna prove
your husband's behind this harassment.

906
01:11:34,380 --> 01:11:38,470
And trying to do that is just playing
his game. He wants you to look paranoid.

907
01:11:38,590 --> 01:11:40,680
We gotta deal with this straight,
as if it's all on the level.

908
01:11:40,760 --> 01:11:43,060
So that's what we'll do,
we'll play it straight.

909
01:11:43,180 --> 01:11:45,640
I'm due in court, I'll call you
when I get ahold of Mrs. Rimsky.

910
01:11:45,770 --> 01:11:48,520
In the meantime, just sit tight.

911
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:51,150
- I will. Thanks so much.
- OK.

912
01:11:51,270 --> 01:11:53,480
- Bye.
- Bye.

913
01:11:53,610 --> 01:11:57,150
- Abigail's making a storm, sweetheart.
- Done!

914
01:11:57,280 --> 01:12:00,370
Done? You remember you have
to sign your name so you know whose it is.

915
01:12:00,490 --> 01:12:04,700
You don't want me to take that home
and say I did it, do you?

916
01:12:04,790 --> 01:12:07,710
I like that. Pirates?

917
01:12:09,540 --> 01:12:11,750
Stop it.

918
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,380
Stop it, I told you, leave me alone.

919
01:12:15,460 --> 01:12:17,720
- We've got rainbows...
- Stop it!

920
01:12:18,380 --> 01:12:20,840
Stop it!

921
01:12:21,050 --> 01:12:23,220
Stop it!

922
01:12:23,430 --> 01:12:25,520
Stop it!

923
01:12:30,690 --> 01:12:32,310
You're gonna get cleaned up
and when you're done

924
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:36,440
you're gonna come back and sit with me
and we'll read a story together.

925
01:12:36,530 --> 01:12:39,820
Then maybe we'll talk about your friend.

926
01:12:42,570 --> 01:12:45,080
Go on.

927
01:13:12,770 --> 01:13:15,320
Ceci!

928
01:13:19,190 --> 01:13:21,780
Go away!

929
01:13:44,470 --> 01:13:46,810
- Where is she?
- She passed out in the bathroom.

930
01:13:46,890 --> 01:13:49,310
We don't know what happened.
There was water all over the place.

931
01:13:49,430 --> 01:13:50,980
- We took her to the hospital.
- Hospital?

932
01:13:51,060 --> 01:13:53,480
We just wanted to check her out.
It's school policy. We couldn't reach you.

933
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:56,690
I had an emergency at work,
I didn't get my messages for two hours.

934
01:13:56,770 --> 01:13:59,070
We called her father
and he's gonna meet her at the hospital.

935
01:13:59,150 --> 01:14:02,740
- OK. Which hospital?
- It's the one right here on the island.

936
01:14:02,820 --> 01:14:05,530
Kyle took her.
They released her and he took her.

937
01:14:05,620 --> 01:14:09,080
- Did they say what was wrong?
- They said, you know, it's nothing serious.

938
01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:10,830
She fainted but...

939
01:14:10,910 --> 01:14:15,830
I'm trying to find him. I called his home
number, I called his cell phone number,

940
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:18,420
I called his office number,
and he's avoiding me

941
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:21,210
so I need to know what to do.
Can I go to his apartment?

942
01:14:21,300 --> 01:14:24,180
Mrs. Williams, I need you to calm down.
I need it, your daughter needs it.

943
01:14:24,260 --> 01:14:25,510
Just calm down, OK?

944
01:14:25,590 --> 01:14:27,850
I'm sorry. I know you don't know me,
but you have to believe me.

945
01:14:27,930 --> 01:14:30,100
I'm not crazy, I'm really not.

946
01:14:30,180 --> 01:14:31,930
- I believe you, Mrs. Williams.
- I'm really not.

947
01:14:32,020 --> 01:14:35,940
Just go home. Your husband and your
daughter are probably waiting for you.

948
01:14:36,020 --> 01:14:39,230
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

949
01:14:40,440 --> 01:14:42,150
Ceci.

950
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:45,450
Ceci.

951
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:52,580
- No new messages.
- Oh, God.

952
01:14:53,870 --> 01:14:57,130
- Hello?
- Hello? It's Jeff. Are they there?

953
01:14:57,250 --> 01:14:58,250
- No.
- They're not there?

954
01:14:58,340 --> 01:15:02,380
No. There's no message.

955
01:15:02,460 --> 01:15:04,800
There's water everywhere.

956
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:08,970
Mrs. Williams, Mrs. Williams, calm down.
Calm down.

957
01:15:09,050 --> 01:15:11,470
- She can't be here.
- What do you want me to do?

958
01:15:11,560 --> 01:15:13,560
Oh, God.

959
01:15:13,640 --> 01:15:17,730
I can't be her mother,
I don't know how to be myself.

960
01:15:18,730 --> 01:15:20,690
Ceci!

961
01:15:28,570 --> 01:15:32,490
I hate you.
Get away from me, you little bitch.

962
01:15:32,580 --> 01:15:34,750
I hate you.

963
01:15:34,830 --> 01:15:35,870
Fuck!

964
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:39,420
I hate you! I hate you!

965
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:41,550
Bitch!

966
01:15:52,100 --> 01:15:54,220
Sorry about this. I really had no idea.

967
01:15:54,350 --> 01:15:56,730
I would've come down myself
a long time ago.

968
01:16:13,290 --> 01:16:15,080
Better open it.

969
01:16:17,210 --> 01:16:19,540
Hello?

970
01:16:19,620 --> 01:16:21,880
Hello?

971
01:16:25,630 --> 01:16:27,760
Jesus.

972
01:16:30,300 --> 01:16:34,100
Look at this. This is appalling.
This is appalling.

973
01:16:34,220 --> 01:16:38,390
The plumber's on his way. I'm paying him
double overtime so he can get here tonight.

974
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:40,600
Hello?

975
01:16:42,730 --> 01:16:45,570
- I'll get some of these lights on.
- Mrs. Williams?

976
01:16:47,740 --> 01:16:50,950
- You OK?
- I'm awake.

977
01:16:51,070 --> 01:16:53,450
The plumber will be here in 15 minutes.

978
01:16:54,580 --> 01:16:57,370
- Mr. Murray?
- This is just a big misunderstanding. OK?

979
01:16:57,500 --> 01:17:00,540
Mr. Veeck did not keep me informed.
This will be fixed tonight.

980
01:17:00,670 --> 01:17:04,170
- Or she's staying at the Plaza, right?
- It will definitely be fixed tonight.

981
01:17:04,250 --> 01:17:07,090
- And I want to talk to Veeck.
- I will get him.

982
01:17:11,220 --> 01:17:13,300
You OK?

983
01:17:13,430 --> 01:17:17,060
- Migraine, huh?
- Yeah.

984
01:17:20,940 --> 01:17:24,110
- I'll keep my voice low.
- Thanks.

985
01:17:24,230 --> 01:17:26,900
I spoke with your husband's lawyer
and Ceci's fine.

986
01:17:27,030 --> 01:17:29,320
Kyle will bring her to school in the morning.

987
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:31,030
OK.

988
01:17:31,110 --> 01:17:34,120
Now, this part is gonna piss you off.

989
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:37,080
They want Ceci to see a psychologist
to be evaluated.

990
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:42,920
There's nothing we can do about that
but say yes. So we're saying yes.

991
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:45,380
OK.

992
01:17:47,210 --> 01:17:49,880
- Here we are.
- Mr. Veeck.

993
01:17:49,970 --> 01:17:52,050
I had an interesting conversation
with Mrs. Rimsky today.

994
01:17:52,130 --> 01:17:55,050
She was very surprised to hear
her daughter isn't living upstairs.

995
01:17:55,140 --> 01:17:57,760
- In 10F?
- Mm-hm.

996
01:17:57,890 --> 01:18:00,770
- You said they left together.
- That's what the Russian said.

997
01:18:00,890 --> 01:18:03,850
No, she left without her daughter.
She didn't think she could take care of her.

998
01:18:03,940 --> 01:18:06,400
Mrs. Rimsky's an alcoholic.
She claimed she was going for treatment,

999
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:09,150
and had to leave the girl behind
with the father.

1000
01:18:09,230 --> 01:18:11,450
You knew that, didn't you?

1001
01:18:11,990 --> 01:18:14,990
Only Mr. Rimsky didn't take Natasha
with him.

1002
01:18:15,070 --> 01:18:16,950
I spoke with Grandma Rimsky
in Moscow today

1003
01:18:17,080 --> 01:18:19,540
and she said her son
is living with her alone.

1004
01:18:19,660 --> 01:18:23,540
- So he lied to me. What do I know?
- You had to know.

1005
01:18:23,670 --> 01:18:28,250
Well, we'll find out tomorrow. I have
a phone appointment with Mr. Rimsky.

1006
01:18:28,380 --> 01:18:32,670
- Why did you lie about the little girl?
- I didn't want to get involved, that's all.

1007
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:35,680
Did you see Natasha after her mother left?

1008
01:18:39,010 --> 01:18:41,390
It's a simple question, Veeck.

1009
01:18:41,480 --> 01:18:46,310
Yeah. I see her. I see her that afternoon.
I see her playing on the stairs.

1010
01:18:46,440 --> 01:18:51,190
Then the next day the father tells me she
leave with the mother. I ask no questions.

1011
01:18:51,320 --> 01:18:54,530
- Well, if he killed her, it's not my business.
- "Killed her"?

1012
01:18:54,610 --> 01:18:57,200
"If he killed her"?

1013
01:18:58,780 --> 01:19:00,580
Plumber!

1014
01:19:00,700 --> 01:19:04,290
You got a lot more than a leak to fix,
Mr. Murray.

1015
01:19:05,370 --> 01:19:07,420
Mr. Veeck.

1016
01:19:09,590 --> 01:19:13,590
- If you could just...
- Come on in, just right inside.

1017
01:19:13,720 --> 01:19:15,880
Thank you.

1018
01:19:16,720 --> 01:19:19,050
Some kind of pipe or something.

1019
01:19:19,140 --> 01:19:22,720
Yeah, well, see, that is a brand-new pipe.
So, this will all be patched tomorrow.

1020
01:19:22,810 --> 01:19:25,600
- By professionals.
- By professionals. Good as new.

1021
01:19:25,730 --> 01:19:30,610
It better be. I'm calling NYPD
to report a child is missing.

1022
01:19:30,730 --> 01:19:34,900
OK. I mean, I'm sure there's
a simple explanation for that, but...

1023
01:19:34,990 --> 01:19:40,370
So, goodnight.
And, again, I am so sorry about all this.

1024
01:19:42,240 --> 01:19:44,370
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

1025
01:19:45,330 --> 01:19:48,380
- You gonna be OK?
- Yeah. I'll be fine.

1026
01:19:49,580 --> 01:19:54,130
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm feeling much better, actually.

1027
01:19:54,260 --> 01:19:57,220
- I gotta go. Family.
- OK. Mm.

1028
01:19:58,180 --> 01:20:02,220
I'll keep my cell on all night
and if you need me just call.

1029
01:20:02,350 --> 01:20:04,560
- Any hour.
- Thanks.

1030
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:08,190
- Thanks again. Bye.
- OK. Bye.

1031
01:20:20,450 --> 01:20:23,080
She left you behind.

1032
01:20:24,540 --> 01:20:27,580
They both left you behind.

1033
01:20:28,710 --> 01:20:29,830
Help me.

1034
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:06,160
Wait!

1035
01:22:46,510 --> 01:22:49,430
I told Murray, I told him a million times.

1036
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:53,020
It's not my job. I'm not a goddamn plumber.

1037
01:23:01,570 --> 01:23:03,780
How you feeling? You OK?

1038
01:23:03,860 --> 01:23:06,030
- You warmed up?
- I'm OK.

1039
01:23:06,110 --> 01:23:10,790
Cops think Veeck probably
left the tank open and somehow she fell in.

1040
01:23:10,910 --> 01:23:13,830
They even think he might have discovered
she'd fallen in weeks ago.

1041
01:23:13,960 --> 01:23:16,830
That's why he hadn't cleaned it in so long.

1042
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:19,290
They might have enough to charge him
with criminal negligence.

1043
01:23:19,380 --> 01:23:24,630
They'd arrest the parents, but they're out
of state and there are no witnesses, so...

1044
01:23:24,720 --> 01:23:29,430
The truth is, they'll probably
never know what happened.

1045
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:33,230
Her mother left her.

1046
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:37,440
The father assumed
that she was with her mom,

1047
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:42,440
and the mother assumed
she was with her father.

1048
01:23:46,660 --> 01:23:49,240
Guess everyone just assumed.

1049
01:23:49,320 --> 01:23:52,120
No one really cared what happened to her.

1050
01:23:52,200 --> 01:23:55,160
That's what it looks like.

1051
01:23:58,920 --> 01:24:02,210
I'll tell Mary you've been a prince.

1052
01:24:02,340 --> 01:24:04,300
You just accomplished the impossible,
Mrs. Williams.

1053
01:24:04,420 --> 01:24:08,050
You actually made me glad
I went to law school.

1054
01:24:13,010 --> 01:24:15,430
- Thank you.
- It's OK.

1055
01:24:16,440 --> 01:24:18,520
I can probably get you
a year's free rent out of Murray.

1056
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:21,480
Oh! No, it's OK.

1057
01:24:21,610 --> 01:24:23,690
I'm moving.

1058
01:24:23,780 --> 01:24:27,070
- Call me in the morning, OK?
- Yeah.

1059
01:24:44,250 --> 01:24:46,260
- Come on, princess.
- Bye, Daddy.

1060
01:24:46,380 --> 01:24:48,630
Bye.

1061
01:24:57,640 --> 01:24:59,060
- How are you feeling?
- Good.

1062
01:24:59,140 --> 01:25:01,400
Yeah?

1063
01:25:04,730 --> 01:25:10,070
OK. I'll be here after school to pick you up.
See you after school.

1064
01:25:15,080 --> 01:25:17,370
- Hey.
- Hi.

1065
01:25:18,330 --> 01:25:20,750
Thank you for taking care
of Ceci yesterday.

1066
01:25:20,830 --> 01:25:24,960
It's OK. I'm really worried
about her mental state.

1067
01:25:25,090 --> 01:25:27,460
- I am too.
- You are?

1068
01:25:27,550 --> 01:25:29,420
Yeah.

1069
01:25:29,510 --> 01:25:32,970
So, I've been thinking...

1070
01:25:33,100 --> 01:25:36,140
I don't want her
to have to choose between us.

1071
01:25:36,260 --> 01:25:39,890
- What do you mean?
- I want to look for a place in Jersey City

1072
01:25:40,020 --> 01:25:43,060
so that shared custody
will be easier for both of us.

1073
01:25:43,190 --> 01:25:46,690
And we can do, you know,
one week with me, and one week with you.

1074
01:25:46,820 --> 01:25:49,860
Or maybe split the week.
We can see what works best.

1075
01:25:50,610 --> 01:25:55,240
- You serious?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1076
01:25:55,370 --> 01:25:59,960
Hey, you know, you were right about the
school here. I checked it out. It's good.

1077
01:26:00,040 --> 01:26:03,170
- Maybe I could get a place...
- No, it's fine.

1078
01:26:03,290 --> 01:26:07,710
After this, we'll get a...
a place in Jersey City.

1079
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:16,930
I'll see you later.

1080
01:26:23,560 --> 01:26:26,610
- When are we moving?
- Not until next week, sweetheart.

1081
01:26:26,730 --> 01:26:31,400
This is winter stuff though
so we can pack it up now.

1082
01:26:31,490 --> 01:26:34,570
You OK? Are you feeling OK?

1083
01:26:47,590 --> 01:26:50,090
What are you thinking about?

1084
01:26:50,170 --> 01:26:53,380
Why did her mommy forget about her?

1085
01:27:04,940 --> 01:27:07,480
Do you know how much I love you?

1086
01:27:10,280 --> 01:27:13,360
- You sure?
- Mm-hm.

1087
01:27:13,450 --> 01:27:17,410
- Do you know I would do anything for you?
- Yes.

1088
01:27:18,620 --> 01:27:20,990
That's a promise.

1089
01:27:21,120 --> 01:27:25,000
- Honey, do you want bubbles tonight?
- Uh-huh.

1090
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:30,250
There you are.

1091
01:27:30,380 --> 01:27:35,340
- That's so great, Dahlia.
- Well, I think it's gonna be for the best.

1092
01:27:35,470 --> 01:27:38,760
And moving out of here,
that is definitely for the best.

1093
01:27:38,890 --> 01:27:42,810
What do you want to do? Be a chef? OK.

1094
01:27:42,890 --> 01:27:46,100
Let's see if we can make you a chef hat.

1095
01:27:49,230 --> 01:27:51,070
There.

1096
01:27:51,150 --> 01:27:53,940
Now, what are you going to cook?

1097
01:27:55,400 --> 01:27:57,240
Mac and cheese?

1098
01:27:57,320 --> 01:28:00,620
Look, I should go get Ceci out of the tub
before she turns into a prune.

1099
01:28:00,740 --> 01:28:03,080
- She's so cute.
- So... Oh!

1100
01:28:03,160 --> 01:28:06,410
Here she is now.
Yeah. So I will talk to you tomorrow.

1101
01:28:06,540 --> 01:28:07,960
- OK. Take care. Bye.
- OK. You too.

1102
01:28:08,080 --> 01:28:09,290
Goodnight.

1103
01:28:09,420 --> 01:28:13,840
- Mommy, can you read me a story?
- Course I can, honey.

1104
01:28:18,840 --> 01:28:21,680
Let's see which one you picked.

1105
01:28:33,860 --> 01:28:37,400
We haven't read this one
in a long time, have we?

1106
01:28:39,360 --> 01:28:44,740
"There were once a man and a woman
who had long in vain wished for a child. "

1107
01:28:44,870 --> 01:28:47,660
We need more snow, don't you think?

1108
01:28:48,710 --> 01:28:51,210
Then let's get some more snow.

1109
01:28:55,880 --> 01:28:58,930
...beautiful Rapunzel.

1110
01:29:11,560 --> 01:29:15,320
Don't leave me.
I want you to be my mommy.

1111
01:29:15,400 --> 01:29:17,990
- Don't leave me.
- Ceci!

1112
01:29:18,070 --> 01:29:20,610
You can't leave me.

1113
01:29:23,410 --> 01:29:25,370
Ceci!

1114
01:29:25,580 --> 01:29:27,580
Ceci!

1115
01:29:27,750 --> 01:29:29,370
Ceci!

1116
01:29:29,580 --> 01:29:31,420
Ceci!

1117
01:29:34,170 --> 01:29:36,340
Ceci!

1118
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:39,590
No!

1119
01:29:41,010 --> 01:29:42,970
Ceci!

1120
01:29:49,230 --> 01:29:51,350
Ceci!

1121
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:52,690
Ceci!

1122
01:29:54,020 --> 01:29:56,020
Oh, God.

1123
01:29:56,110 --> 01:29:59,440
Let her go! You let her go!

1124
01:30:04,910 --> 01:30:06,540
No!

1125
01:30:21,880 --> 01:30:24,220
No! Please!

1126
01:30:24,300 --> 01:30:28,010
Natasha! Let her go! Please.

1127
01:30:29,060 --> 01:30:31,890
We'll stay. We'll stay here with you.

1128
01:30:33,980 --> 01:30:36,770
What do you want?

1129
01:30:38,070 --> 01:30:40,610
I'll be your mother.

1130
01:30:40,740 --> 01:30:42,950
- Please.
- Forever?

1131
01:30:45,570 --> 01:30:48,080
Forever.

1132
01:30:48,200 --> 01:30:50,330
Forever. Yes.

1133
01:30:50,410 --> 01:30:53,710
I'll be your mother forever.

1134
01:30:53,830 --> 01:30:56,790
Take me. Please, take me.

1135
01:32:00,900 --> 01:32:05,950
Yeah, OK. So we got an 11-46,
Caucasian female, aged 30,

1136
01:32:06,070 --> 01:32:09,450
no apparent cause of death,
and a six-year-old girl with shock.

1137
01:32:09,570 --> 01:32:11,580
Trying to locate the father.

1138
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:25,880
Ceci.

1139
01:33:04,710 --> 01:33:09,340
Let's go home, honey.
Would you get the door?

1140
01:33:50,680 --> 01:33:54,550
We did a whole bunch of them.
A whole neighborhood.

1141
01:33:54,680 --> 01:33:57,180
What was this one about?
Do you remember?

1142
01:33:57,270 --> 01:34:00,350
That was me and then that was you.

1143
01:34:00,440 --> 01:34:03,900
- That was a tree.
- A tree.

1144
01:34:04,020 --> 01:34:09,990
- And then that's a little angel.
- Beautiful gold wings on the angel.

1145
01:34:33,140 --> 01:34:35,140
Come on.

1146
01:34:37,390 --> 01:34:39,890
OK, honey, let's walk.

1147
01:34:42,230 --> 01:34:44,940
What's wrong with you?

1148
01:34:49,320 --> 01:34:51,490
Come on.

1149
01:34:55,910 --> 01:34:57,080
Ceci.

1150
01:34:57,330 --> 01:34:58,790
Ceci?

1151
01:34:59,080 --> 01:35:00,000
Ceci?

1152
01:35:00,080 --> 01:35:02,410
Open the door.
Push the button, Ceci.

1153
01:35:02,500 --> 01:35:05,380
Open it. Open the door. Ceci!

1154
01:35:34,610 --> 01:35:36,950
My beautiful girl.

1155
01:35:48,540 --> 01:35:51,130
Whenever you need me, I'm here.

1156
01:35:54,630 --> 01:35:57,470
OK, Daddy. Let's go.
