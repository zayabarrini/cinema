1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:05,430
For 15 years, everybody believed
Jean-Marc Faure.

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,950
His wife, his parents, his friends.

3
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:33,150
The one thing worse than being exposed
is not to be exposed.

4
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,230
This film is based on a true story.

5
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,950
Christine?

6
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:08,550
L'Adversaire (The Adversary)

7
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,870
- Where is this house?
- Outside the village, towards Gex.

8
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:32,200
Three bedrooms on the top floor.
A bargain for sure.

9
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,550
- But there's no garden.
- Yes, with a cherry tree.

10
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,220
- Could you have a look?
- Yes.

11
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:43,710
Hurry up kids! - Vincent,
Finish your corn flakes!

12
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,190
- I'm not ready yet.
- Hurry up then!

13
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,630
Let's get going.

14
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,830
Bye.

15
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,910
- Do I pick you up tonight?
- I have a busy schedule. I'll call.

16
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,270
Bye.. Be nice!

17
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:29,670
- Late again?
- You can never foresee the traffic.

18
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,950
- Didn't shave today?
- Peritonitis at 04:00!

19
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,550
Did you see the fresco the kids made?
The solar system with angels as mules.

20
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,630
I'll watch it tomorrow.

21
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:47,940
A pair of radiologists have moved in
and they want to meet you.

22
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,550
They didn't know about the local genius.
We'll invite them for dinner...

23
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,510
I'll call Christine. Bye.

24
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,870
- She told me you're looking for a house.
- Don't you start too.

25
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:07,390
In HIV-ridden countries we notice
an increase of tuberculosis.

26
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:13,350
It now seems as if HIV is a bigger
threat than tuberculosis

27
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:19,190
If this tendancy persists,
countries where HIV is...

28
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:29,870
The auditorium is booked for a meeting
and is open for the public again at 5 o'clock.

29
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,830
Mister, We are closing.

30
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,270
Have you washed your hands?
Let me see... Are you sure?

31
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:45,070
- Don't do that, She's a slut.
- Who taught you words like that?

32
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:48,110
You have to visit Baptiste
at the hospital in Gex.

33
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,470
- Is it an odontologial surgery?
- Yes, you have to assist.

34
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:56,790
I got his name. Dr Zurcan.

35
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,820
Are you listening?

36
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,470
I'll go.

37
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:09,510
- What is it?
- A japanese colleague gave it to me.

38
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,990
"I have nothing", studdered Lina.
"I didn't know about the three magic gifts"

39
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,870
"I just wanted some fireworks"

40
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,750
- Go to sleep.
- I can read in the dark.

41
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,470
I want to say initially... this...

42
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:58,270
to you, Christine, and the kids,
because I love you.

43
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,310
Because you mean everything to me.

44
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,430
The years have passed.
I thought I had it all figured out.

45
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,070
That there was an eventual way out...

46
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:19,030
I'll try to explain, to myself,
when all this started.

47
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:27,830
Our religion states that it's never
too late, that forgiveness is possible.

48
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:33,350
But it also states that you don't
have to right to take your own life.

49
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,550
Everything I've done,
good or bad...

50
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:15,910
- Have you seen the house yet?
- No, but it has to be renovated.

51
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:19,030
- Doctor?
- An apricot pie for ten.

52
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,950
- Sure.
- Thanks.

53
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:27,790
People will start to think you're a
cheapskate or that you have a mistress.

54
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,120
You can't expect your family to be happy
living on 50m2. How long will they cope?

55
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,950
You're not going to the expo, are you?

56
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,470
- Well, Where were we?

57
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,390
Good.

58
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,270
- When is the wedding?
- 12:th of may.

59
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:09,030
Where are we having lunch? La Rabette,
or at Girard's in Annecy?

60
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:14,070
You decide, but La Rabette is nice,
by the lake, and the food is better.

61
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:18,310
- Yes, he is right.
- Jean-Marc has spoken.

62
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:33,390
- His mind is set on a Mercedes.
- You want to brag...? For whom?

63
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,710
Nobody. It's a regular car,
not a Rolls Royce.

64
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:41,830
- A Mercedes...
- Can I get a key to it?

65
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:06,510
I have to talk to you.
I have to withdraw some money.

66
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,870
100 000 franc
for the first deposit.

67
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,950
I can tell you.
I went for the coupé model.

68
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:19,430
I want it for Xavier's wedding.
We have to go the bank in Genèva.

69
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,990
If you say so...

70
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:29,580
I don't handle the finances. From what
you told me, it's about 2 years interest.

71
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:34,920
I don't want to get another loan
with all the paperwork and extra charges.

72
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,310
What's going on?

73
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,950
I'll call you.
We'll arrange a meeting with the bank.

74
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,110
Did you fall?

75
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:09,580
You're always in a hurry. We have to
find a solution for the constant overdraw.

76
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:14,820
I guess a person like you got other accounts.
Do you have time to talk right now?

77
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:19,900
- No, I'm off to Dijon.
- Then you have to visit me soon.

78
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:23,630
See you soon then.

79
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:39,500
I'd like to withdraw 5 000 franc
from my parents' account.

80
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,070
- Do you have the authorization slip?
- Of course.

81
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:45,900
- Sorry, I'm new here.
- No problem.

82
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,790
- Are you off to Bourg-en-Bresse?
- No, to Lyon.

83
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,430
Jean-Marc...

84
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,150
Jean-Marc Faure.

85
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:09,430
- You don't remember me? Michel Philiooot.
- Of course, How are you?

86
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:14,110
I wasn't sure it was you.
Are you on holiday?

87
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:19,630
- I had some errands in Lyon.
- Come visit my clinic just next door.

88
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,430
- Aren't you getting that?
- Yes.

89
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,230
- I hear you teach at Besancon.
- Dijon.

90
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,350
Then you must know Lentier. He's the
professor in neurology in Dijon.

91
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:33,910
- We've met.
- Funny, We share practise.

92
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:46,590
I took over my dad's old clinic.
We handle minor depressions.

93
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:51,230
You're from the country, right?
You've been teased alot?

94
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,630
- What did your father do?
- He was a forest warden.

95
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:58,670
Your parents must be proud.

96
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,830
I'm sure I still have a photo
of you from the time we studied.

97
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,910
Tarar, Benel, Luc, Arbousier.

98
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,790
I don't see you on this.

99
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:26,460
Do you know Jean-Marc Faure?
He teaches at Dijon.

100
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:32,510
We went to medical school together,
except for the practise period.

101
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,790
- I don't think we have...
- You work together with Zylberstein.

102
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,630
I have been confined to the side building,
since the flooding last year.

103
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:47,190
We can't even get into
Rue Tisserand anymore.

104
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:51,180
- Not even the library or the archives.
- Oh well, it's one big mess.

105
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:56,470
- Doc, mrs Perrin is here.
- We'll meet soon again i presume.

106
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,350
This is me.

107
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,430
Where have you been? Your beeper
was off, so I nearly called WHO.

108
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,070
She was very worried.
WHO is not exactly Fort Knox!

109
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:29,870
- A drink?
- Yeah, I'd love a whiskey.

110
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:37,150
Wasn't it this secrecy that got you
interested initially?

111
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,510
Maybe so.

112
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,550
Maybe I was too straight forward?

113
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:46,380
- Are you staying for dinner?
- No thanks.

114
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:54,390
How did it all happen?
I don't recall.

115
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:58,190
At the end of the summmer you were
engaged, and I...

116
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:08,190
Jean-Marc, I guess that's dad.
He's called twice already.

117
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,990
He's obsessed with the
Mercedes plans.

118
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,390
Answer!

119
00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:02,910
Did you notice the massacre at Juzy?
They even cut down young trees!

120
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:10,820
Have to be some idiots with fancy
diplomas without any knowledge in forestry.

121
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,470
- I intend to write to Gex!
- There's no need.

122
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:21,470
I bought it for you in Holland,
Forgot to bring it last time around.

123
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:24,390
Beautiful!

124
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,470
I couldn't find Rotterdam on the map.

125
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,260
It's there.

126
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:43,310
- I'm in a hurry.
- Of course.

127
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:53,310
- Are you getting the extra pension?
- Yes.

128
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,950
We don't see Christine very often.

129
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,590
We don't see the children either.

130
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:12,470
She doesn't like the forest.
We'll drop by in september.

131
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:15,950
When it's turning colder.

132
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:19,860
You never want to go anywhere.

133
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,950
How long is he going to sleep?

134
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:12,340
You needed some rest.

135
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:16,270
- What time is it?
- Almost four.

136
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:20,150
Don't you have to call work?

137
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:27,270
- Has somebody been in my room?
- No.

138
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:31,590
Yes, I forgot.
We changed the wall socket over there.

139
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:35,070
But we didn't go through your stuff.

140
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:42,230
The years have passed so quickly.
I thought I would have time....

141
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:46,390
That there would be a way out...

142
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:50,300
But everything is moving slowly
when you are alone with a dark secret.

143
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:56,110
You have reached Marianne Malartre.
Leave a message after the beep.

144
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,430
Marianne?

145
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,350
Are you there?

146
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,590
Answer. Please....

147
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,470
Aren't you there?

148
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,550
I don't know what happened.

149
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:17,910
I don't know why things have turned
out like this.

150
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:26,830
Don't be afraid of me.
I didn't mean to hurt you at all.

151
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,800
- Marianne, more wine?
- Thanks.

152
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:42,830
I'm at the pharmacy on thursdays.

153
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:48,790
- Yes, you can see the arteries more clearly.
- Angioscintigrafh replaces the arteriografh.

154
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,070
That would reduce the examination time.

155
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:57,870
- My kids are not going to a religious school.
- The subject is not mandatory.

156
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:03,550
Freedom first!
The principal is special, Maletras.

157
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,790
No authority!

158
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,190
A normal development...

159
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:14,270
- The number of cases could be checked.
- It's possible, I don't research myself.

160
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:21,830
- I'll have a cigarette.
- In the past, when we were barbarians,
I used to sting them here.

161
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:29,390
- What a nice top! Is that silk?
- Yes, I wanted it in black.

162
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:34,910
X-ray symposium, Chicago, in november!
When it's that cold you stay and listen.

163
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:42,510
- You won't find nice clothes here.
- And... you can wear it like this.

164
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,790
- It stays up.
- What are you doing?

165
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:52,630
Getting undressed like that.
You are provoking us young men.

166
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:56,150
Anyway, it suits her.

167
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:04,950
- Are you getting used to living here?
- Well, when the night comes, I'm scared.

168
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:09,750
Soft version! The version I get is:
"You have buried me alive in this pit"

169
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:16,590
- I wanted to go to Paris this monday.
- My wife leaves the house and seduces men...

170
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:20,030
There are some nice places to visit here.
We'll show you.

171
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,070
- I like Divonne.
- And the casino!

172
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:27,630
- I always stop at 2 000 Francs down.
- And I take her patients too!

173
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:31,350
Shut up! That's a dumb thing to say.

174
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:35,550
Well, that was a bit dumb....

175
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,310
- I'll put on some coffee.
- No, I'll do it.

176
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,470
I'll help you.

177
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:49,700
You never saw the pictures from the picnic.
When we go for a swim with the priest.

178
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:57,390
Your wife is pretty.
By that, I don't mean you're ugly.

179
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:04,310
Do you know why you can't live with
the women that turn you on?

180
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:11,910
You simply don't reflect....
You just follow a predicted straight line.

181
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,510
- Is there anymore white wine?
- Yes.

182
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,470
WORLD HEALTH ORGANISATION

183
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,300
Yes?

184
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:16,260
I'm here to see my son-in-law.
Dr. Faure.

185
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,870
- Come again?
- Faure, F... a... u.

186
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:40,670
- Are you sure that...
- Sorry, my meeting ended late...

187
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:46,190
- I started to get worried.
- Let's go somewhere for a drink.

188
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:49,550
An ethnic place!

189
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,630
- Christine's never been here?
- No.

190
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:56,310
Did you get my message this morning?

191
00:30:56,520 --> 00:31:03,110
- We had an appointment. I was there.
- The guy that handles the account is in Zürich.

192
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:07,100
- I'll call him tomorrow.
- He said I could get the money anytime.

193
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:13,190
Yes, but we have to sign the papers.
Too bad doing it now, when it's up 18%.

194
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:22,100
- I thought the money was for the children.
- I don't steal! I'm upset, Marc.

195
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:28,140
Oh well, I won't raise my voice.

196
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,750
- What's that?
- A fishing magazine for you.

197
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,990
Tomorrow then?

198
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:48,270
- Tomorrow there's a masquerade at school.
- Then we'll do it tuesday.

199
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:56,070
I don't know what the weather is like in Oslo.
I'll pack two sweaters.

200
00:31:56,280 --> 00:32:02,030
The children will be disappointed.
Why didn't you tell me about this before?

201
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:05,550
The guy handling the paperwork
has family problems...

202
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:11,430
- You haven't prepared?
- No, but I'll do it on the plane.

203
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:14,990
Do you know which hotel
you'll be staying at?

204
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,470
No.
They are picking me up at the airport.

205
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:29,630
Why are you bringing this much stuff?

206
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:39,750
I was supposed to meet your father this week.
Tell him... I'll phone him when I'm home.

207
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,470
Good day, Mrs. Faure.

208
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,270
Good day.

209
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:42,030
You are a better swimmer than me.

210
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,590
I don't like pools.
I like the ocean, and the salt water.

211
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,100
I have only been to the ocean twice.

212
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:52,070
- Do you never travel with your...
- Jean-Marc?

213
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,550
Not often.

214
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,750
Isn't he uncomfortable
leaving you alone by yourself?

215
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:03,310
No,
It's rather me who does the worrying.

216
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:09,310
- That he won't come back?
- No, but...if he gets lost.

217
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:14,420
Come now, children, have a break.

218
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:16,070
Luc!

219
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:20,510
The impregnable fortress.

220
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:24,150
I don't like the trunks.
We'll get him some tangas.

221
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:27,390
He hasn't left his room for two days.

222
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:35,310
I'm off soon.
Can I clean the room now?

223
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:47,790
You can stay if you want.

224
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,270
Good day.

225
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:26,710
Are you going to Norway?

226
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,470
Yes.

227
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:36,910
I visited the museum, and then I went
back to the hotel. Did Alice get her shot?

228
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:42,060
No, Oslo is beautiful. They have a
famous area here called "Karl Johan".

229
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:46,190
Really nice, but very noisy.

230
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,750
Do you hear me?
I can't hear you properly.

231
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,590
Waht are you doing? Come on in!

232
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:27,670
I don't have the money.

233
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:31,500
I wanted a grey metallic, but the
waiting list is at least 6 months.

234
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:35,420
So i took a blue-coloured one,
a dark-blue nuance.

235
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:39,790
We have an appointment at 4
with the salesman.

236
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,910
I don't have the money.

237
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:50,460
In about two years I can build a pool
for the kids, when the money has accumulated.

238
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:51,430
Come on...

239
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:59,030
Look at this? Almost done up there,
but I had to reinforce the whole shell.

240
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:04,140
There's time...
Come, let me show you.

241
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:16,870
They will have their workroom down there,
and I can work in peace up here.

242
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:25,230
Come and see, I'm putting two windows here
next month. I've ordered them.

243
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:30,190
Walk carefully. Not on the left side.

244
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:35,870
They never clean up.

245
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:41,150
You have to look after Christine & the kids.

246
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:45,790
Why do you say that?

247
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,830
We can't go get the car.

248
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:58,110
Don't start again!

249
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,670
Why not?

250
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,870
Why not?

251
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:19,020
What's the matter?
Are you ill?

252
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:22,230
I don't have the money.

253
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:31,270
What do you mean?
Did you lose them betting on something?

254
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:37,510
Did you lose the money?

255
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:03,030
What are you up to?
Where are you? I can't see you.

256
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,150
Jean-Marc.

257
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,390
Right eight times,
left six times.

258
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:21,070
No, left ten times.
- Daddy, Alice's pushing me.

259
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:24,310
Stop it, Vincent!

260
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:29,070
- How many kilometers have we been driving?
- Seven, eight...

261
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:33,270
Isn't this house too expensive?

262
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:36,670
- We're passing a tennis court.
- Vincent's cheating.

263
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:41,070
- Where are we, Dad? In Saint-Martin?
- I won't tell.

264
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,660
Vincent!

265
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,790
Christine!

266
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:14,030
Anybody home?

267
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:26,190
- Jean-Marc!
- I'll go to the other side.

268
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,950
They cut down the cherry tree.

269
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:13,030
The remote works from the kitchen.

270
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:17,350
- Is it expensive?
- Dunno. It was there already.

271
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:22,710
- When are we going to see the donkey?
- I don't know, sweetheart.

272
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:28,190
- Do they never wear you out?
- They are just a little exhilarated.

273
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:36,660
- Can we go see the donkey now?
- It's in the meadows, going nowhere.

274
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,390
We'll go there in a bit.

275
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:44,390
- What a beautiful lamp. Is it crystal?
- Jean-Marc's boss gave it to us.

276
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:48,190
- I can't choose. Which one do you like?
- I like this one.

277
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:52,510
Don't you think mum's looks better?

278
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:58,070
When she's around people it's alright.
When she's alone, she just cries for hours.

279
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:01,190
I call her every night.

280
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:09,590
Why did Jean-Marc suddenly
decide on this house?

281
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:14,230
We had been thinking about it for a long time.
He thought that time was running out.

282
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:20,510
- Too bad we didn't keep the house in La Frette.
- It was you who wanted to sell it.

283
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:25,070
We really couldn't keep the house
where daddy died, could we?

284
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:28,870
But he spent alot of time fixing it.

285
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:32,780
1.300.000 with 18% interest.
Sorry to bring it up, but...

286
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,350
- What does that come to? 240.000 a year?
- Approximately.

287
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:40,670
You placed it, you should know.

288
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:45,710
- The amount dad put in is still there, right?
- Yes, It's untouched.

289
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:53,270
- We never see anything, not a single paper.
- Would you like to place it, be my guest.

290
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:57,470
You know very well I don't know
the first thing about that kinda business.

291
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:55,750
We aren't leaving already, are we?

292
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:59,990
- Let's have a final drink.
- We all have work tomorrow.

293
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:03,900
Me too.
What's the rush?

294
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:07,820
A bad play and now this......

295
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:09,750
Stop it.

296
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:15,630
Being turned down is one thing, but
being on a date with couples is
pure masochism....

297
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:20,510
- Get a hold of yourself!
- I can't stand you guys.

298
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:23,180
- Where is he going?
- Rémi!

299
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:27,180
- We can't leave him.
- Rémi!

300
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:40,550
They have discussed the separation
alot, and now he is unhappy.

301
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:45,780
- Have you answered her letter?
- Did I tell you she wrote?

302
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,540
I think she's enjoying Paris.

303
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:53,710
- Why are you taking this road?
- More scenic for a change.

304
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:56,510
There's a light on at your place.

305
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:01,950
Your office is on the third floor, right?
There's a light on.

306
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:05,590
I guess they're cleaning.

307
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:17,510
The jewelry he gave you during the
relationship...

308
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:22,390
I got this ring too.
After the divorce I stayed in Paris.

309
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:28,310
He and his wife visited me.
We had tea at my place.

310
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:31,710
I mainly talked with her,
with Christine.

311
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:38,830
I was close to her,
but I hardly remembered him.

312
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:43,430
- But one day I got a big bouquet of flowers.
- When was this?

313
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:46,710
After ten days. Really nice flowers.

314
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:51,070
I was really surprised,
and he took me to dinner.

315
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:06,390
I'm here to with Mr. Faure.

316
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:13,390
This way please.

317
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:24,510
Good evening.

318
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:29,070
- Good evening.
- I don't remember doing this already.

319
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,990
Thanks for the lovely flowers.

320
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:36,190
I thought we could dine on the terrace,
but the weather is too bad. Are are ok?

321
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:39,750
- Yes. Christine's not here?
- No.

322
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:45,950
- Do you live here? The symposium is on...?
- Connective Tissue Surgery.

323
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:51,060
It's big business
and they need sponsors bad.

324
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:53,310
Ministers begging...

325
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:58,750
If you're into philosophy, it might be
interesting eventhough it may appear shocking.

326
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:02,350
It's the market.
It's the same all over the world.

327
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:05,390
But you meet interesting people.

328
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:09,630
Take Kouchner for example.
He's doing a remarkable job.

329
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:13,350
- Do you know him?
- Yes, We have become...

330
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:17,390
friends might not be the word,
but we meet alot.

331
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:24,110
He's controversial, but today
you have use media to be seen and heard.

332
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:28,830
- I have always liked him.
- If you want to meet him, I can arrange it.

333
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:34,470
I didn't know you were involved
in this line of work,
and that you knew those kind of persons.

334
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:36,830
This was fantastic.

335
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:40,270
In Ferney, you were always so shy,
so discrete.

336
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:43,390
- Another bottle of Champagne?
- We already emptied this one.

337
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:46,990
- Maybe half a bottle.
- We don't have that.

338
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:49,270
A bottle then.

339
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,670
- It's warm in here.
- Yes.

340
00:49:56,280 --> 00:50:01,990
- You're sweating. A cigarette?
- No, thanks, I have my cigars.

341
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:03,310
Thanks.

342
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:12,030
Maybe we could go to an `
exhibit together?

343
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:18,790
I don't have much spare time. I work
'til 8, and I have the kids.

344
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:24,590
But if I understand this correctly,
you have alot of time.

345
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:29,430
- What do you have planned for the holiday?
- I don't know.

346
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:35,430
Rémi has the kids for 3 weeks.
I decide the last minute where to go.

347
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:39,510
I love you.

348
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:46,190
I didn't catch that.

349
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:51,230
I enjoy seeing you like this,
eating together, but...

350
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:55,950
- You're right.
- I'm friends with Christine.

351
00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:02,160
- Is this the reputation I created for myself?
- Don't be silly.

352
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:07,590
- For you.
- What is it?

353
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:10,100
- An apology.
- No, no.

354
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:13,670
- Yes, Have a look.
- No, but...

355
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,390
No, no, no.

356
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:23,270
Sure, it's beautiful,
but I couldn't accept it.

357
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:54,710
Up 'til then there hadn't been
anything between us.

358
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:59,470
He often visited me in Paris,
and we dined in expensive restaurants.

359
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:05,310
But he was always discrete.
Sometimes he brought presents.

360
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:09,590
He is interested in alot of things,
and we talked about various subjects.

361
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:12,750
But he never tried to...

362
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,310
I'm totally wasted.
The drinks just kept coming.

363
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:22,060
This was good,
but Jamain was more high class.

364
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:23,870
Tomorrow, diet...

365
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:28,940
- Hi. Everything ok?
- They fell asleep early.

366
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:34,430
- Here you are. See you tuesday.
- Yes.

367
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:37,310
- Good night.
- Good night.

368
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:41,990
She thinks of course that we...

369
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:44,550
Well, never mind!

370
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:50,670
- Will you stay here after all?
- I hope so. It's my aunt's apartment.

371
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:53,340
Are you driving all night?

372
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:58,230
I can't see you doing it.
Promise me you'll stop if you get tired.

373
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:03,430
Call me next time you come to Paris.
Take care.

374
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:22,760
Can I sleep here?

375
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:30,390
If you want. There's another bedroom.
I don't know if there're blankets.

376
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:34,380
Oh that's right, in the cupboard.

377
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:37,030
Help yourself.

378
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:03,310
- What time is it?
- Six.

379
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:07,220
- Have you been sleeping?
- No.

380
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:27,630
I get the feeling I can tell
you anything.

381
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:33,590
I don't recall any conversations
with other men.

382
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:52,540
- So that's where you got to know him?
- Yes, in Lyon, in medical school.

383
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:57,880
And you became friends.
One could almost say that you became...

384
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:00,380
...the best of friends.

385
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:06,860
What was he like back then?
Did he act weird? Was he...?

386
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:10,830
Reserved. Intelligent.

387
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:16,950
Shy at times. You wanted to protect him.
I always wanted to protect him.

388
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:21,230
- You went to the same class the second year.
- Yes.

389
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:25,990
He never graduated.

390
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:32,710
Do you remember if anything strange
happened during that 2:nd year?

391
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:34,550
No.

392
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:38,630
Maybe some problems with Christine,
but nothing that lasted.

393
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:45,270
You took the same courses, but he never
passed any tests, and you didn't realize that?

394
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:46,740
No.

395
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:49,590
He signed up again and again
and you...

396
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:53,710
You didn't even took the time to check
if his name was on the exams list.

397
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:59,110
No, We studied together and he was good.
Better than me even.

398
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:05,270
So why not believe him? We weren't in the
same group. Everybody believed him.

399
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:09,990
- What kind of work did he do for WHO?
- Head professor in cardiology.

400
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:13,510
- How did he get that job?
- He applied for it...

401
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:16,830
...through an old colleague
who was the head for the laboratory.

402
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:20,740
You are a doctor yourself, but you
never visited him at WHO.

403
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:26,270
I suggested it a couple of times.
He said yes, but he later chickened out.

404
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:32,830
Never any questions.
you never noticed anything?

405
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:40,630
Maybe I was a bad listener.

406
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:47,630
I feel like I'm dying, and you
tell me all is well.

407
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:51,620
- I can give you a ride to the hospital.
- No, I guess you're right.

408
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:56,190
- I guess I'm fine.
- Keep it down, the kids are asleep.

409
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:59,710
Do you have anything to drink?
Any booze?

410
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:04,710
You seem so worried.

411
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:10,470
Maybe so, but there are surely
good reasons for me feeling this way.

412
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:15,230
- Do you want to talk about it?
- Yes, Of course I want to talk about it!

413
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:21,270
But... I warn you, hold on tight,
because you're gonna faint when you hear it.

414
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:25,670
It's almost two and I'm a total wreck.

415
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:39,390
I have been wanting to say this for a while.
It was during the 2:nd year. Just after...

416
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:47,590
...after exam, the results. You were in
classroom B. There was music, Sangria...

417
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:52,190
- Do you remember?
- Why are you mentioning this now?

418
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:59,670
I walked down the corridor and you went:
"Did you pass?"

419
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:05,710
Christine and I had just broke up.
She didn't want to see me.

420
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:14,270
- We...
- Is it a woman?

421
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:21,710
- No, It's not a woman.
- But you always travel to Paris.

422
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:25,910
Don't tell me it's... Marianne?
Is it her?

423
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:30,670
- Is it her?!
- Why not?

424
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:34,910
She is the kind you sleep with
and then forget about.

425
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:39,910
- You don't know what you're saying.
- Don't ruin everyhing for a slut like that.

426
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:43,740
- I know her, I know.
- Don't speak to me like a 10-year old!

427
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:48,590
I don't want your moral lectures!
What gives YOU the right?

428
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:53,710
What makes your lifestyle so perfect?

429
00:59:56,040 --> 01:00:01,510
- You'll be unhappy.
- It's the only thing in my life that feels right.

430
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:06,910
What do you want me to say?
"You'll experience the great passion.."

431
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:12,350
It won't happen...
Break it up now while you can.

432
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:16,950
Don't tell me she loves you,
'cause I won't believe it.

433
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:25,070
Talk to Christine about it.
She's intelligent, she'll understand.

434
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:32,750
It will help you get over it.

435
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:44,190
What's going on in there?

436
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:52,470
What was all that about the party
in classroom B?

437
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:04,590
Nothing.

438
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:24,070
Amandine, How...

439
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:27,750
...at the end of the second year
of medical school.

440
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:34,630
I had passed some tests. That morning
I was supposed to take a physiology test.

441
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:39,660
Suddenly I felt something inside...

442
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:43,950
...that collapsed and fell.

443
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:52,580
I could hardly stand up.
I couldn't, so I never went to the test.

444
01:01:57,240 --> 01:02:03,310
I'm not a doctor.
I don't work at WHO.

445
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:09,110
When I leave my house,
I go nowhere.

446
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:15,510
I drive around,
stopping, waiting.

447
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:36,240
And now when I no longer exist, I don't
know if my death can save us.

448
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:42,200
- They're looking for you. They want to go.
- Sure, honey, I'm on my way.

449
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:52,880
- Another one?
- Last one!

450
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:56,880
- Three whiskey with ice. - And you?
- A Malibu.

451
01:02:57,120 --> 01:02:58,760
- Can you fix it?
- I think so.

452
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:02,160
Why does he have to fix your necklace?

453
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:06,560
I met Marianne when I picked up
the kids. We are talking again.

454
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:14,280
She is the same old Marianne,
She has a crush on a wealthy dentist.

455
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:19,720
I can tell when she's in love.
Her neck is always moist.

456
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:24,360
- You slep with her too, right?
- No, I never did I'm afraid.

457
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:26,280
A Malibu for me too...

458
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:33,040
She has another lover.
Also a doctor....

459
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:40,560
She sticks to men in the same line of work.
Although he's dull and bores her, she told me.

460
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:45,480
There, this should do the trick.

461
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:12,600
I didn't want to come at first,
but I know you'd appreciate it, but...

462
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:17,160
...we have to stop seeing eachother...
...like this I mean.

463
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:20,520
I can't go on. It's all over.

464
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:24,600
You are so moody.

465
01:04:28,120 --> 01:04:32,000
- I'm not. Not with you.
- Yes, you are trying hard not to.

466
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:35,560
But there's something about you.
Something dark and depressing.

467
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:37,600
You're kind, you take me to
fine restaurants-

468
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:42,960
- but I can't be with anyone
that sad all time.

469
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:47,440
I'm not strong enough.

470
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:54,040
We can go for a boat ride if you want.

471
01:04:55,360 --> 01:04:58,840
I don't know if the guys who rents
them is there today.

472
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:15,120
- What's the matter?
- I had an accident.

473
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:19,080
Where? Tell me about it.

474
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:26,560
A guy hit me, I ran off the road
and was thrown out of the car.

475
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:29,760
The car flipped over three times.

476
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:35,040
- But the car is right there!
- It was the WHO car.

477
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:39,680
They flew me with a helicopter
to the hospital in Lausanne.

478
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:42,400
Why didn't you call?

479
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:45,680
I lost my cell phone.

480
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:49,360
- Did they have a look at you? You're bleeding.
- It's nothing.

481
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:52,680
Did you pick up the car at WHO?

482
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:58,360
That looks like scratch marks.
Or maybe it's from the grabble.

483
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:03,920
Or maybe from when the windshield
was shattered?

484
01:07:05,240 --> 01:07:08,160
I'll fix you up.

485
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:08,640
Hurry. Otherwise we'll be late.

486
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:13,800
- Is daddy still sick?
- No, he's resting.

487
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:17,920
Emmeline, will you look after them?
I'll be right there.

488
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:28,160
I'm off.

489
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:42,640
You haven't given me the check
for the school lunches.

490
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:50,240
Tomorrow.

491
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:35,440
Christine...

492
01:11:03,640 --> 01:11:06,880
What are you looking for?

493
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:13,840
I don't know.

494
01:11:18,280 --> 01:11:22,120
You have to leave tonight...
I just have a few minutes now.

495
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:25,080
But I appreciate you coming
on such short notice.

496
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:28,680
Give this to Lange, please.

497
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:31,560
- Coffee?
- Yes, please.

498
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:35,840
So, you don't have time to eat?
Too bad.

499
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:41,440
My big brother...
You look ok.

500
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:44,560
I had a rough period, but now
I'm much better.

501
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:47,480
Let's sit here.

502
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:55,600
- And the dentist?
- It's over.

503
01:11:56,280 --> 01:11:59,840
- Are you angry?
- You know perfectly well I'm not.

504
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:03,280
- Do you still see Rémi?
- Not that often.

505
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:06,480
- We just sold the clinics in Ferney.
- Did you get a good price?

506
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:09,440
Yes, I got 900.000 franc.

507
01:12:09,680 --> 01:12:12,520
I wanted to talk to you about that.

508
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:14,560
- Do you have a clue why?
- No.

509
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:16,680
Well..

510
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:22,080
No, please.

511
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:29,160
- Do you have a cigarette?
- Watch it, Cavalier comes at 2 p.m.

512
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:32,400
- What you talked about, in Genèva.
- No.

513
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:35,920
Why not? Do me that favour.
Please...

514
01:12:36,160 --> 01:12:41,960
- My contact there has moved.
- But your family's money is still there?

515
01:12:42,240 --> 01:12:46,960
I don't deal with that stuff no more.
I have quit.

516
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:52,040
Just for a short while.
I could use that kind of money.

517
01:12:52,280 --> 01:12:55,520
As soon as I decide to buy.

518
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:07,960
- How will you pay?
- First payment cash.

519
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:12,280
Please verify that it's 100.000 franc.

520
01:13:26,160 --> 01:13:29,240
Vincent, don't!

521
01:13:31,720 --> 01:13:35,400
- New or used?
- New.

522
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:38,920
I didn't like the idea.

523
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:44,160
Where is the dog?

524
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:47,920
Is that you?

525
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:52,640
No, you did the right thing.

526
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:55,520
I was away.

527
01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:03,320
It's a bit complicated withdrawing
money with a high interest like that.

528
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:09,120
That's the standard procedure.
I'll fix it tomorrow.

529
01:14:22,360 --> 01:14:25,760
Ah, it's you. Thanks for calling.

530
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,600
No, I haven't slept.

531
01:14:30,160 --> 01:14:35,440
No, don't say that. I didn't mean
to hurt you last night.

532
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:39,720
I don't recall, but if you say so,
I believe you.

533
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:43,440
Let's forget the whole thing.

534
01:14:43,680 --> 01:14:47,960
Yes, I will.
I'm meeting a person.

535
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:49,920
Yes. Yes.

536
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:57,640
No, I am alone right now.

537
01:14:57,880 --> 01:15:01,160
Home with her mother.

538
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:04,920
Playing in the garden.

539
01:15:06,680 --> 01:15:09,720
Is it dark already?

540
01:15:25,880 --> 01:15:29,040
I don't hear you that good.

541
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:33,240
Marianne...

542
01:15:54,680 --> 01:16:00,480
Were there any signs?
When did he begin to act strange?

543
01:16:00,720 --> 01:16:05,880
I don't know. The last three months
we didn't meet at all. We had a fight.

544
01:16:06,120 --> 01:16:09,760
- Fight over what?
- Just a stupid thing.

545
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:14,440
Our children go to a private school.
Catholic.

546
01:16:14,680 --> 01:16:17,840
The principal turned out to be a problem.
He ran the school very poorly.

547
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:23,080
And on top of that, he had an affair
with a first grade teacher.

548
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:25,760
They went at it in the principal's office.

549
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,720
Right or wrong, but we got rid of him.

550
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:32,880
We took a vote, and Jean-Marc
also voted for his removal.

551
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:37,560
The next day however, Christine
started a petition in favor of the principal.

552
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:40,080
And you?

553
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:43,680
Very well, thank you all.
See you on monday.

554
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:47,760
- Did they fire him?
- Yes.

555
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:54,840
Without any insight
in a man's potential problems.

556
01:16:55,080 --> 01:16:58,800
The whole thing made me think
about Job's chapter in the bible.

557
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:02,880
"They judge, and a head will fall"
"But what gives them the right to judge"

558
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:07,800
- Did you express your thoughts?
- Yes, but I was alone.

559
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:11,640
I'm not in on this. How rude!
Luc is a prick!

560
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:15,720
- I should fight this. Was Emmeline there?
- No.

561
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:23,360
It's Christine. We have to talk. I'm furious
over a matter that concerns us all.

562
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:28,520
In school today, everybody voted for
Maletras dismissal. Everybody except Jean-Marc.

563
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:32,960
We can't agree to that.
Let's start a petition.

564
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:14,240
- Are you still on bad terms with Luc?
- Sad, but I don't want to give in.

565
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:18,960
- I never anticipated this uproar.
- How many have signed the petition?

566
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:21,880
- 50 or more...
- Not bad.

567
01:18:22,120 --> 01:18:25,760
- It's like civil war.
- Bye for now.

568
01:18:35,200 --> 01:18:36,960
- Mrs. Faure...
- Yes.

569
01:18:37,200 --> 01:18:42,800
We have met, but I've never really
spoken with you. I'm Mrs. Xinning.

570
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:49,360
My husband works at WHO.
So does your husband, I have heard.

571
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:54,840
My husband has tried to get ahold of
Jean-Marc, but he can't find him in the registry.

572
01:18:55,080 --> 01:18:58,360
- That's why I'm here.
- The registry?

573
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:00,160
I don't know.

574
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:06,240
We're in the phone book.
Please call us.

575
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:10,720
- Do you want anything while you're here?
- No.

576
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:13,400
Then please excuse me.

577
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:20,560
- Do you like it?
- Yes.

578
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:24,040
- When? We have to set a date.
- Beginning of January.

579
01:19:24,280 --> 01:19:26,840
The beginning of January?!

580
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:30,640
I can't go to Paris on week days.

581
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:37,160
- We ate here the first time.
- Friends shouldn't argue about money.

582
01:19:37,720 --> 01:19:39,520
I lost my apetite.

583
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:43,840
When, then?

584
01:19:56,880 --> 01:20:02,000
Kouchner has a dinner party on a
saturday. Wanna come?

585
01:20:02,240 --> 01:20:07,880
- Where?
- Countryside, near Paris. Fontainebleau.

586
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:11,480
Who will be there?

587
01:20:11,720 --> 01:20:17,640
It's not a big thing, pretty intimate.
His wife for sure, and maybe 2,3 friends.

588
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:24,120
- Which date is better? 16:th or the 9:th?
- 9:th.

589
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:37,600
"CHRISTMAS"

590
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:33,560
Christine!

591
01:21:45,680 --> 01:21:49,920
- Get in the car. I'll be there shortly.
- Are you getting rid of some papers?

592
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,880
Come on, sweet mother Mary.

593
01:22:02,120 --> 01:22:07,240
Someone has to inform you that you have
two ugly wrinkles popping up when you smile.

594
01:22:12,680 --> 01:22:14,880
Alice!

595
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:18,120
My house will be packed at lunch.

596
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:23,080
- Is the master of depression alright?
- Yes, He's picking up his parents.

597
01:22:23,320 --> 01:22:29,800
He's a funny guy. He could have told
me directly that he didn't agree.

598
01:22:30,040 --> 01:22:34,840
- He told you, right?
- No, that's the weird part.

599
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:38,360
- He didn't want to remove Maletras.
- He did, He voted as everybody else.

600
01:22:38,600 --> 01:22:44,320
That's why I didn't get it.
Never mind, it's all forgotten by now.

601
01:22:46,680 --> 01:22:49,560
What's the matter?

602
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:54,200
Then he lied to me.
He lied to me.

603
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:58,040
What's wrong?

604
01:22:58,280 --> 01:23:02,280
- Are there any oysters left?
- We have to throw them out like last year.

605
01:23:02,520 --> 01:23:03,960
- Need any help?
- That won't be necessary.

606
01:23:04,200 --> 01:23:08,920
- Do your cousins want onions?
- Dunno, they're watching pictures right now.

607
01:23:09,160 --> 01:23:12,440
Let me do it. I'd be glad to do it.

608
01:23:12,680 --> 01:23:15,840
Don't we have any lemon?

609
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:19,240
- There was a small accident.
- Stop it!

610
01:23:19,480 --> 01:23:23,000
- They've opened them all.
- I strictly told them: "After lunch".

611
01:23:23,240 --> 01:23:28,000
Vincent, stop that,
or go to your room right now.

612
01:23:48,480 --> 01:23:51,800
- Won't Luc be here this year?
- No.

613
01:23:52,040 --> 01:23:55,280
- But he's alright?
- Yes.

614
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:59,000
I met him this morning.

615
01:23:59,960 --> 01:24:04,080
- Alot of food! Watch out..
- I'll move that.

616
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:09,720
Stand closer together!

617
01:24:10,720 --> 01:24:14,600
Jean-Marc isn't here.

618
01:24:26,040 --> 01:24:29,160
Jean-Marc! Jean-Marc! Jean-Marc!

619
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:35,760
Stand next to Christine.
Give her a kiss.

620
01:24:38,160 --> 01:24:41,520
- And now....?
- Merry christmas!

621
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:45,360
C-H-E-E-E-S-E!!

622
01:24:56,240 --> 01:25:01,560
- Do you know where Jean-Marc is?
- We haven't seen him for a while.

623
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:08,720
Alice, go get Dad.

624
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:23,720
Everything I've done, good or bad,
I did for you.

625
01:25:23,960 --> 01:25:27,200
Because I love you.

626
01:25:29,240 --> 01:25:33,560
Because you mean everything to me.

627
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:40,560
But now, when I'm not around anymore,
I don't know if my death will save us.

628
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:48,200
They're looking for you, Dad.
They're leaving.

629
01:25:48,440 --> 01:25:51,680
Yes, honey, I'll be there.

630
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:11,360
But, Mom?
40.000 less? That's impossible.

631
01:26:14,640 --> 01:26:20,320
- You have had all the time in the world!
- I just forgot the "t's".

632
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:24,200
- Alice, are you done?
- Almost!

633
01:26:24,440 --> 01:26:27,160
It has to be a computer error.

634
01:26:28,680 --> 01:26:30,560
Don't you worry. I'll go there myself.

635
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:32,440
Yes!

636
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:35,560
Yes, now.

637
01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:40,280
Let's see, two tear gas cartridges.

638
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:44,200
- Ammunition. One or two boxes?
- One.

639
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:50,920
- Do you know how to handle this?
- Yes, I think so.

640
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:58,920
Can I get it all in different
gift wraps?

641
01:26:59,440 --> 01:27:01,200
Yeah, you can.

642
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:04,080
If that's what you want..

643
01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:15,920
- I don't have any fancy wrapper.
- A silencer too, to a .22 rifle.

644
01:27:30,760 --> 01:27:35,880
He's depressed.
Doctor Bertier mentioned surgery.

645
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:39,640
Glaucoma.

646
01:27:39,880 --> 01:27:42,520
- Will you have lunch?
- No time.

647
01:27:42,760 --> 01:27:46,400
- Eat something at least.
- A quick bite maybe.

648
01:27:48,680 --> 01:27:53,560
We received a letter from the bank.
The account is still on minus.

649
01:27:53,800 --> 01:27:58,840
It's the same mistake. I've told
you I'm gonna handle it.

650
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:08,360
I'm getting some books.

651
01:28:53,720 --> 01:28:57,560
Jean-Marc?!
I'm busy, but do come in.

652
01:28:57,800 --> 01:29:04,360
Hélène had a daughter in Génève this morning.
I'm looking after the kids.

653
01:29:05,720 --> 01:29:09,600
- Isn't Luc here?
- Stop it, kids!

654
01:29:18,840 --> 01:29:21,560
That's the third time today.

655
01:29:21,800 --> 01:29:23,680
- Are you alright?
- Yes.

656
01:29:23,920 --> 01:29:27,600
Shall I tell Luc that you were here?

657
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:29,320
Yes.

658
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:32,720
And tell him that...

659
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:42,760
I'll go.

660
01:29:46,880 --> 01:29:50,960
Do you think Dad's at the Pizzeria
already?

661
01:29:51,200 --> 01:29:53,640
No.

662
01:30:56,040 --> 01:30:58,960
What's wrong with mummy?

663
01:31:09,720 --> 01:31:13,040
"The prince was still in the well"-

664
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:18,840
- "but the walls were so slippery
that he couldn't get out."

665
01:31:19,080 --> 01:31:25,480
"He was devastated, but suddenly he
saw the fox staring down from the edge."

666
01:31:36,040 --> 01:31:37,720
Sleep tight.

667
01:32:23,960 --> 01:32:27,520
Your mother is too lonely.

668
01:32:28,720 --> 01:32:35,720
- Why aren't you in the  WHO catalogue?
- She could come here for a couple of days.

669
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:40,640
What catalogue?

670
01:32:40,880 --> 01:32:45,200
I don't know. Apparently there's
a catalogue for the WHO employees.

671
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:49,640
Stop drinking like that.

672
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:58,640
You never take us anywhere.
We have never seen the WHO christmas tree.

673
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:02,480
You let us live like savages.

674
01:33:02,720 --> 01:33:08,440
Something is wrong here.
Why aren't you in the catalogue?

675
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:18,040
And all the money you spend.
Buying a car that's worth a fortune!

676
01:33:18,280 --> 01:33:21,120
- It's all for you.
- I don't give a damn about all that.

677
01:33:21,360 --> 01:33:25,520
- The account is empty!
- Who told you that?

678
01:33:26,720 --> 01:33:31,880
- If you've been fired, then tell me.
- Why should I've been fired?

679
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:42,000
Misconduct.

680
01:33:42,240 --> 01:33:45,720
Have you been fired or not?

681
01:33:45,960 --> 01:33:49,240
I don't know.

682
01:33:51,200 --> 01:33:57,520
- It's true that the winter's been rough.
- You're not answering.

683
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:04,400
I can't go on like this.

684
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:08,280
I'm starting to get afraid.

685
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:15,400
Why didn't you tell me
you voted for Maletras' dismissal?

686
01:34:15,640 --> 01:34:19,600
I was ashamed when Luc told me.

687
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:27,280
- You're putting me in a tough position.
- Well. maybe I wasn't clear on that.

688
01:34:27,520 --> 01:34:30,440
Sometimes I don't remember.

689
01:34:30,680 --> 01:34:33,880
Do you want me to leave?

690
01:34:34,120 --> 01:34:36,960
- Why aren't you in the catalogue?
- Maybe that would be the best thing?

691
01:34:37,200 --> 01:34:40,240
What's going on, Jean-Marc?

692
01:34:44,560 --> 01:34:49,200
You don't miss anything. I have always
seen to it that you've had it all.

693
01:34:49,440 --> 01:34:50,680
You're not answering.

694
01:34:50,920 --> 01:34:55,560
That's irrelevant in comparison
to my love for you.

695
01:35:11,080 --> 01:35:14,200
Why aren't you in the catalogue?

696
01:35:21,040 --> 01:35:23,840
It's too late.

697
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:26,720
Tomorrow..

698
01:35:46,720 --> 01:35:51,360
I don't want us to separate.
I love you.

699
01:35:54,440 --> 01:35:57,240
I love you too.

700
01:37:03,480 --> 01:37:05,480
Yes.

701
01:37:05,720 --> 01:37:07,960
Hi, Emmeline.

702
01:37:09,080 --> 01:37:11,800
She's still sleeping.

703
01:37:15,280 --> 01:37:18,520
Do you want me to wake her up?

704
01:37:21,320 --> 01:37:24,040
Yes, I'll tell her.

705
01:37:25,080 --> 01:37:29,400
- Be quiet, mummy's still sleeping.
- Could you put on a cassette?

706
01:37:30,560 --> 01:37:33,400
This one.

707
01:38:22,920 --> 01:38:27,160
She approached the large table
but it was to high...

708
01:38:27,400 --> 01:38:29,200
Red.

709
01:38:41,960 --> 01:38:44,520
Green.

710
01:38:52,680 --> 01:38:54,040
Yellow.

711
01:38:56,880 --> 01:38:58,600
Yellow.

712
01:39:00,200 --> 01:39:02,360
Yellow.

713
01:39:07,120 --> 01:39:10,360
Your hand is cold.
Let me get a ruler.

714
01:39:10,600 --> 01:39:13,320
No, stay here.

715
01:39:34,280 --> 01:39:39,440
You're warm.
You have a fever. Let's check.

716
01:40:02,360 --> 01:40:04,800
Lie on your stomach.

717
01:40:05,040 --> 01:40:08,080
Here, you know what to do.

718
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:14,520
- For how long?
- Count to 200.

719
01:40:14,760 --> 01:40:19,040
Or sing the song....
"Pirouette, Cacahuète."

720
01:41:44,480 --> 01:41:48,840
There's nothing wrong with me.
I want to watch the ending.

721
01:42:01,120 --> 01:42:04,720
Come up here,
I want to check your temperature.

722
01:42:58,600 --> 01:43:00,960
Hi, Jean-Marc!

723
01:43:07,760 --> 01:43:10,720
So, you're bringing it back?

724
01:43:24,160 --> 01:43:29,280
The ventilation in your room isn't
working. I think it's the filter.

725
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,080
There's alot of strange smells
in that room.

726
01:43:35,320 --> 01:43:37,560
- Some more?
- No thank you.

727
01:43:40,280 --> 01:43:43,440
I took some sage from the garden.

728
01:43:54,800 --> 01:43:59,920
- What's wrong with the ventilation?
- The repair man can't come 'cause of the snow.

729
01:44:01,720 --> 01:44:06,440
Why do I have to go up here again?
I checked it this morning already.

730
01:44:06,680 --> 01:44:09,920
We have to get the repair guy here.

731
01:44:25,960 --> 01:44:30,200
I unplugged it, to keep it from
shorting out.

732
01:44:30,720 --> 01:44:32,880
Let's check the grating.

733
01:44:41,680 --> 01:44:46,880
Stubborn, eh?
I'm telling you, it doesn't work.

734
01:44:47,120 --> 01:44:50,600
Want me down on my knees do you?

735
01:44:52,080 --> 01:44:54,480
You have to change it.

736
01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:57,200
They'll be here on monday.

737
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,400
I'm in here.

738
01:45:25,280 --> 01:45:27,640
What's the matter, boy?

739
01:45:37,560 --> 01:45:40,040
What are you doing in here?

740
01:45:41,160 --> 01:45:46,080
- Did you exchange the photos?
- What photos? We haven't changed anything.

741
01:45:53,800 --> 01:45:57,000
Jean-Marc, what are you doing?

742
01:47:16,160 --> 01:47:18,720
- Did you get it for christmas?
- Yes.

743
01:47:20,080 --> 01:47:23,480
Stop it, Manuel.

744
01:47:23,720 --> 01:47:26,200
- Turn it down!
- No.

745
01:47:29,520 --> 01:47:33,000
What do you think?
Too dressed up?

746
01:47:33,240 --> 01:47:35,320
I'm changing my belt.
Do we have time?

747
01:47:35,560 --> 01:47:38,760
- I'll help you with that.
- Thanks.

748
01:47:41,160 --> 01:47:43,000
Could you come in here?

749
01:47:50,320 --> 01:47:54,200
- How many cars do you think?
- Four, five.

750
01:47:54,440 --> 01:47:56,800
The hair like this, alright?

751
01:47:57,600 --> 01:47:58,680
Fine.

752
01:48:04,600 --> 01:48:09,720
- Any news about my money?
- I promise you'll get them on monday.

753
01:48:12,560 --> 01:48:15,680
I will go there when they open.

754
01:48:44,680 --> 01:48:49,120
If I take the executive role for INSERM
it means I'll go to Paris.

755
01:48:49,360 --> 01:48:56,360
- I don't understand this map.
- I'll get the fifth floor in the building.

756
01:48:56,600 --> 01:49:02,360
I discussed it with Christine
and we agreed.

757
01:49:02,600 --> 01:49:05,440
We are going to separate.
Probably the best thing to do.

758
01:49:05,680 --> 01:49:10,000
I'm gonna miss the children.
That's the hardest part.

759
01:49:11,680 --> 01:49:13,760
Not going to see them as often...

760
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,920
You'll never leave Christine.

761
01:49:18,080 --> 01:49:21,120
Make a right here.

762
01:49:24,600 --> 01:49:28,960
We already drove passed this.
I recognize that roundabout.

763
01:49:29,200 --> 01:49:33,080
- We are just driving in circles, aren't we?
- No.

764
01:49:34,600 --> 01:49:37,560
We haven't even seen a sign
saying "Neuville" yet.

765
01:49:37,800 --> 01:49:43,320
Stop here! There's a pay phone over there.
Otherwise this will take all night.

766
01:49:56,360 --> 01:50:01,160
- Go over there and make the call.
- I don't have the number.

767
01:50:01,400 --> 01:50:06,360
You don't have the number?!
You're joking!

768
01:50:06,600 --> 01:50:11,640
What are we supposed to do know?
Where are we? We are lost.

769
01:50:11,880 --> 01:50:16,520
I think I have the number
in a bag back in the trunk.

770
01:50:18,240 --> 01:50:20,440
This can't be happening.

771
01:50:43,440 --> 01:50:47,600
- Come here, I have a surprise for you.
- Not now. Call them!

772
01:50:47,880 --> 01:50:53,680
- I have a present for you.
- Cut it out! This is ridiculous!

773
01:50:53,920 --> 01:50:57,240
Come out just a minute, please.

774
01:51:04,280 --> 01:51:08,080
- Close your eyes.
- I must be dreaming.

775
01:51:50,760 --> 01:51:53,680
No!

776
01:52:03,960 --> 01:52:06,680
Think about my kids.

777
01:52:06,920 --> 01:52:09,600
My kids.

778
01:52:56,120 --> 01:53:01,120
What's happening to us?
What got into you?

779
01:53:04,760 --> 01:53:08,480
You attacked me.
You hurt me.

780
01:53:11,040 --> 01:53:17,160
You started it.
Why would I hurt you?

781
01:53:17,400 --> 01:53:19,120
Me?

782
01:53:20,840 --> 01:53:23,320
I think so.

783
01:53:38,240 --> 01:53:42,120
Don't you remember what you did?

784
01:53:43,760 --> 01:53:50,280
Sorry. I have been feeling bad lately.
Sometimes I get lost in the moment.

785
01:53:53,680 --> 01:53:57,600
- Look at me! We can't go there now.
- Yes we can.

786
01:53:57,840 --> 01:54:00,640
- Give me a ride home.
- Yes, It's starting to get late.

787
01:54:00,880 --> 01:54:05,120
Drop me off at a gas station.
I'll grab a taxi from there.

788
01:54:11,040 --> 01:54:16,240
Maybe I should call them
to tell them I'm sorry.

789
01:54:43,360 --> 01:54:49,800
Good evening, this is Jean-Marc Faure,
We can't come, we're lost.

790
01:54:50,040 --> 01:54:53,920
Hi, you have reached
Alice, Vincent, Mum and Dad.

791
01:54:54,160 --> 01:54:57,840
We are not home.
Leave a message after the beep.

792
01:57:13,200 --> 01:57:14,440
Christine...

793
01:59:34,640 --> 01:59:36,920
He's alive.
