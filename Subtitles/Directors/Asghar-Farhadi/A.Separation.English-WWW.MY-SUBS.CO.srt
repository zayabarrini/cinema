19
00:01:34,929 --> 00:01:38,266
What you are saying
are not good reasons for a divorce.

20
00:01:38,433 --> 00:01:41,019
- If there is something else let me know.
- Like what?

21
00:01:41,186 --> 00:01:45,356
Like if he is an addict, beats you
or does not give you an allowance.

22
00:01:45,523 --> 00:01:48,860
Nothing like that.
He is a good, decent person.

23
00:01:49,027 --> 00:01:50,945
Then why do you want a divorce?

24
00:01:51,112 --> 00:01:52,697
He won't come with me.

25
00:01:52,864 --> 00:01:56,951
If he does I'll cancel my
request for a divorce.

26
00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:00,455
- Will you come?
- No, I won't.

27
00:02:00,538 --> 00:02:03,374
- Why not, Your Honor?
- You know why.

28
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:05,960
No, I don't. Please explain again why.

29
00:02:06,044 --> 00:02:08,963
Let her explain why we should
move abroad in these circumstances.

30
00:02:09,047 --> 00:02:11,466
- You give me one reason to stay.
- I'll give you a thousand.

31
00:02:11,549 --> 00:02:15,303
- Just one.
- My father. I can't leave him.

32
00:02:15,386 --> 00:02:16,506
But you can leave your wife?

33
00:02:16,554 --> 00:02:19,224
- When did I leave you?
- You brought me here.

34
00:02:19,307 --> 00:02:20,308
You filed for a divorce.

35
00:02:20,391 --> 00:02:23,436
When you tell your wife and child to leave,
isn't that leaving them?

36
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,980
Your Honor, didn't he just say
leave if you want?

37
00:02:26,064 --> 00:02:27,440
Yes, and I'll say it again.

38
00:02:27,524 --> 00:02:30,068
If you don't want to stay
I can't keep you by force.

39
00:02:30,151 --> 00:02:32,153
Keep your voice down. Calm down.

40
00:02:32,237 --> 00:02:35,406
One day you came to live with me.
Today you don't.

41
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:38,159
- When you prefer...
- What does "you prefer" mean?

42
00:02:38,243 --> 00:02:39,911
This was something we both started.

43
00:02:39,994 --> 00:02:44,499
Your Honor, after 18 months of running
around and expenses, we got our visa.

44
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:48,336
It has been six months now
and it will expire in 40 days.

45
00:02:48,503 --> 00:02:50,171
Why should we lose this opportunity?

46
00:02:50,338 --> 00:02:54,843
You don't want to lose this opportunity,
then make a suggestion.

47
00:02:54,926 --> 00:02:56,010
You know my situation.

48
00:02:56,094 --> 00:02:58,137
Tell us what to do, Your Honor.

49
00:02:58,221 --> 00:03:01,766
- His father is his excuse...
- He is not my excuse. He's the reason.

50
00:03:01,933 --> 00:03:03,685
- Let me speak.
- Calm down.

51
00:03:03,852 --> 00:03:06,896
His father has Alzheimer's.
He doesn't even know that he's his son.

52
00:03:07,063 --> 00:03:11,401
- What difference does it make to him?
- Why are you saying that?

53
00:03:11,568 --> 00:03:13,403
Does he even realize you are his son?

54
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:15,446
I know he is my father.

55
00:03:15,613 --> 00:03:18,741
Your daughter or her future is
not important to you?

56
00:03:18,908 --> 00:03:22,620
Who said anything about our daughter?
Why do you think only you care?

57
00:03:22,787 --> 00:03:26,374
So the children living in this country
don't have a future?

58
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:29,794
As a mother, I'd rather she didn't grow up
in these circumstances.

59
00:03:29,961 --> 00:03:32,213
What circumstances?

60
00:03:33,798 --> 00:03:38,303
Is she better off here with both her
parents or there without a father?

61
00:03:38,469 --> 00:03:41,139
That's why I want him to come.

62
00:03:41,306 --> 00:03:43,308
I can't leave.

63
00:03:43,474 --> 00:03:45,768
How many times do I have to say it?

64
00:03:45,935 --> 00:03:49,314
He can't come. So what happens to me?

65
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,649
Nothing. Go back to your life.

66
00:03:52,984 --> 00:03:55,069
If I could I wouldn't file for a divorce.

67
00:03:55,236 --> 00:03:58,948
Consent has to be mutual.

68
00:03:59,115 --> 00:04:00,992
He just gave his.

69
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:02,493
Do you agree to a divorce?

70
00:04:02,577 --> 00:04:06,414
If she prefers to leave her family
to go live abroad, yes, I do.

71
00:04:06,581 --> 00:04:08,416
He agrees.

72
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:10,293
What about my daughter?

73
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:13,671
You have to agree on everything.
How old is your daughter?

74
00:04:13,838 --> 00:04:15,924
Eleven in two weeks.

75
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:19,135
She can't leave
without her father's permission.

76
00:04:19,302 --> 00:04:21,012
He won't give permission.

77
00:04:21,179 --> 00:04:22,972
That's between you two.

78
00:04:23,139 --> 00:04:25,975
Please sign here and good day.

79
00:04:26,142 --> 00:04:28,078
Your Honor, I came here
for you to solve my problem.

80
00:04:28,102 --> 00:04:29,520
Please sign here.

81
00:04:29,604 --> 00:04:30,605
You, too.

82
00:04:30,688 --> 00:04:33,316
- Where should I sign?
- Here.

83
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:36,611
He can have everything,
I just want my daughter.

84
00:04:36,778 --> 00:04:40,531
Our daughter is attached to me.
She doesn't even want to go with you.

85
00:04:40,698 --> 00:04:43,034
- She doesn't know better.
- Why not?

86
00:04:43,201 --> 00:04:45,495
She is 11 years old.

87
00:04:45,662 --> 00:04:48,623
Please sign here
and don't take the court's time.

88
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:52,043
- No one knows better except you.
- No, you're the one who knows better.

89
00:04:53,503 --> 00:04:56,297
Your Honor, what should I do?
I only have 40 days.

90
00:04:56,464 --> 00:04:58,525
You can't file for a divorce
over every little problem.

91
00:04:58,549 --> 00:04:59,884
A little problem?

92
00:05:00,051 --> 00:05:02,220
My problem is not little.

93
00:05:02,387 --> 00:05:05,390
It is my daughter.

94
00:05:06,182 --> 00:05:08,643
She is his daughter, too.
He has rights, too.

95
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:11,396
My finding is that your problem is
a small problem.

96
00:05:11,562 --> 00:05:13,648
Please sign here and good day.

97
00:05:18,736 --> 00:05:23,032
A Separation

98
00:05:23,116 --> 00:05:25,535
Producer, Writer, Director
Asghar Farhadi

99
00:05:55,606 --> 00:05:57,608
You said the second floor.

100
00:05:57,775 --> 00:05:59,277
This is the second floor.

101
00:05:59,485 --> 00:06:00,611
Then what's that?

102
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:04,365
That's the ground floor, that's the first.
This is the second.

103
00:06:04,532 --> 00:06:07,118
The price we gave was for two floors.

104
00:06:07,285 --> 00:06:09,245
But the buyer will pay you.

105
00:06:09,328 --> 00:06:10,705
Only for two floors.

106
00:06:11,456 --> 00:06:13,458
I don't understand what you're saying.

107
00:06:13,624 --> 00:06:15,001
Call the buyer.

108
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,795
This is three floors.

109
00:06:19,756 --> 00:06:22,341
I'll pay for one floor. Let me pass.

110
00:07:00,254 --> 00:07:02,131
Excuse me, ma'am?

111
00:07:08,012 --> 00:07:09,323
Go tell your dad they want to leave.

112
00:07:09,347 --> 00:07:10,598
Why don't you tell him?

113
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:13,351
What did I say?

114
00:07:13,434 --> 00:07:14,894
Didn't we agree?

115
00:07:16,771 --> 00:07:18,481
I'm studying.

116
00:07:29,534 --> 00:07:30,576
Hello.

117
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:31,661
Hello, ma'am.

118
00:07:33,538 --> 00:07:35,123
I'll be right there.

119
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:40,378
I don't know how much you know.

120
00:07:40,545 --> 00:07:45,007
The work is taking care of my father.

121
00:07:45,174 --> 00:07:47,176
There is some housework, too,

122
00:07:47,343 --> 00:07:51,222
but the main work is giving him
his medication on time,

123
00:07:51,389 --> 00:07:55,893
keeping him away from the stove,
from leaving the house.

124
00:07:56,227 --> 00:07:59,063
Termeh, get your laundry.

125
00:07:59,355 --> 00:08:04,152
You have to be here at 7:30
so I can go to work.

126
00:08:04,652 --> 00:08:06,696
7:30 is too early.

127
00:08:06,863 --> 00:08:10,241
I'll have to leave my house at 5:00
to get here by then.

128
00:08:10,408 --> 00:08:11,868
Can you make it by 8:00?

129
00:08:12,034 --> 00:08:13,661
I don't know.

130
00:08:14,829 --> 00:08:16,831
8:00 is good too.

131
00:08:16,998 --> 00:08:19,208
Ring the upstairs bell.

132
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:22,545
I'll leave the house keys up here.

133
00:08:22,712 --> 00:08:23,754
- Okay?
- Yes.

134
00:08:24,088 --> 00:08:26,007
Can you pay us, please?

135
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,925
What's the pay per month?

136
00:08:28,092 --> 00:08:29,385
She'll be right there.

137
00:08:29,552 --> 00:08:30,845
300,000 a month.

138
00:08:30,928 --> 00:08:32,513
That's too little.

139
00:08:32,597 --> 00:08:34,348
No, that's the rate.

140
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:36,225
Ask around. The commute is far.

141
00:08:36,767 --> 00:08:38,352
Several bus lines.

142
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:40,062
It's what I can afford.

143
00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:43,566
If you agree you can start tomorrow.

144
00:08:43,733 --> 00:08:44,942
Can I let you know tomorrow?

145
00:08:45,109 --> 00:08:47,111
They might need this, too.

146
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:48,404
I don't have change.

147
00:08:48,613 --> 00:08:49,739
You have till the afternoon.

148
00:08:49,906 --> 00:08:53,075
There is someone else
I can hire if you can't come.

149
00:08:53,242 --> 00:08:54,243
Okay.

150
00:08:55,244 --> 00:08:57,622
Termeh! Your laundry!

151
00:09:16,307 --> 00:09:17,808
Aren't you coming?

152
00:09:25,107 --> 00:09:28,027
- Why are you taking your books?
- I want them.

153
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,322
All these for just two weeks?

154
00:09:40,581 --> 00:09:42,500
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

155
00:09:47,672 --> 00:09:49,507
Which setting does she use?

156
00:09:49,674 --> 00:09:51,592
Should I go ask her?

157
00:09:52,677 --> 00:09:55,346
You want to make me look bad?

158
00:10:00,017 --> 00:10:02,603
- Simin, where are you going?
- I'll be right back.

159
00:10:03,771 --> 00:10:06,649
Just to the corner. I'll be right back.

160
00:10:10,194 --> 00:10:11,696
I'll come back.

161
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,448
I have an appointment.

162
00:10:14,699 --> 00:10:16,158
Four.

163
00:10:16,325 --> 00:10:17,618
Why four?

164
00:10:18,202 --> 00:10:20,037
'Cause it has faded.

165
00:10:20,204 --> 00:10:24,458
She must've used it the most.

166
00:10:26,168 --> 00:10:27,962
Four it is.

167
00:10:28,838 --> 00:10:31,882
From now on we'll set everything on four.

168
00:10:32,717 --> 00:10:34,385
She is really leaving.

169
00:10:35,219 --> 00:10:36,387
She'll be back.

170
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:37,471
Termeh!

171
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:40,558
Come stay with your grandfather.

172
00:10:51,193 --> 00:10:52,528
Dad?

173
00:10:53,738 --> 00:10:55,906
Termeh, honey, go to your room.

174
00:10:56,866 --> 00:10:59,076
Dad, get up.

175
00:10:59,243 --> 00:11:00,911
Let go of her hand.

176
00:11:01,245 --> 00:11:05,082
Get up. I want to take you to the bathroom.

177
00:11:11,088 --> 00:11:12,882
Where are you taking me?

178
00:11:12,965 --> 00:11:16,260
The bathroom and then to get the paper.

179
00:11:16,594 --> 00:11:18,929
Darling, I said go to your room...

180
00:11:21,891 --> 00:11:24,435
- Where are you taking me?
- Come on.

181
00:11:28,272 --> 00:11:30,274
Don't put your hand there.

182
00:11:58,094 --> 00:11:59,428
I'm taking this CD.

183
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:02,264
Take whichever you want.

184
00:12:02,473 --> 00:12:03,891
No, just this one.

185
00:12:22,785 --> 00:12:23,786
Bye.

186
00:12:56,944 --> 00:13:00,322
I thought you lived there, too.

187
00:13:01,115 --> 00:13:02,867
No, I've moved to my mom's.

188
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,996
This is a bit difficult.

189
00:13:07,538 --> 00:13:09,874
No, you can trust him.

190
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:12,877
Don't worry about these things.

191
00:13:13,461 --> 00:13:15,713
Besides, he won't be around.

192
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:20,718
He leaves early and comes back
when you leave.

193
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:26,056
Do bring your daughter.
She'll keep my daughter company

194
00:13:26,182 --> 00:13:28,559
and I'll feel better.

195
00:13:34,064 --> 00:13:36,192
Tell your decision to your sister-in-law.

196
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,301
Where are you going?

197
00:15:01,652 --> 00:15:02,736
What's this?

198
00:15:05,489 --> 00:15:06,490
Oxygen.

199
00:15:06,949 --> 00:15:08,117
What's oxygen?

200
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:10,077
Get away. You'll wake him.

201
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:43,193
I can't hear anything.

202
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,622
What is it doing?

203
00:16:07,217 --> 00:16:08,385
Hello.

204
00:16:08,969 --> 00:16:10,471
Where do you want to go?

205
00:16:11,055 --> 00:16:12,514
- The paper.
- What?

206
00:16:12,681 --> 00:16:14,683
I want the paper.

207
00:16:15,893 --> 00:16:17,645
The paper is in your room.

208
00:16:18,729 --> 00:16:21,065
Come, I'll take you to your room.

209
00:16:26,153 --> 00:16:29,573
I'll take you to your
room and get your meal.

210
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,416
Mommy,

211
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,835
he's peed in his pants.

212
00:16:48,592 --> 00:16:49,885
Sit on the bed.

213
00:16:54,556 --> 00:16:55,933
What's that?

214
00:17:01,605 --> 00:17:03,607
What are you doing here?

215
00:17:04,608 --> 00:17:07,778
Go get your shoes.
You can see the floor is soiled.

216
00:17:10,447 --> 00:17:12,741
He'd say when he needed to go...

217
00:17:15,536 --> 00:17:17,621
Take him to the bathroom...

218
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:24,753
I can't come till 12:00. I have class.

219
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:29,216
Call my husband.

220
00:17:29,383 --> 00:17:31,093
Do you have his number?

221
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:33,470
Write it down.

222
00:17:34,221 --> 00:17:36,432
There's a pen by the phone.

223
00:17:47,651 --> 00:17:51,405
If I bring you some pants can you change?

224
00:17:52,114 --> 00:17:55,117
Your clothes, can you change them?

225
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,327
Simin?

226
00:17:57,411 --> 00:17:59,079
Can you wash yourself?

227
00:17:59,163 --> 00:18:00,164
Simin?

228
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,593
Here are your clothes.

229
00:18:14,303 --> 00:18:17,598
Wash yourself and put them on.

230
00:18:18,807 --> 00:18:20,768
I put your towel here.

231
00:18:21,143 --> 00:18:22,853
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

232
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:25,773
Clean yourself up.

233
00:18:27,357 --> 00:18:29,359
Put your pants in there.

234
00:18:34,364 --> 00:18:35,866
Will you manage?

235
00:18:48,128 --> 00:18:49,671
Your pants.

236
00:18:50,631 --> 00:18:51,882
Take them off.

237
00:18:52,049 --> 00:18:54,718
Wear the ones I gave you.

238
00:18:54,885 --> 00:18:56,178
Okay?

239
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:04,353
Simin...

240
00:19:34,258 --> 00:19:36,927
Hello. I had a religious question.

241
00:19:37,094 --> 00:19:39,012
I am working in a house.

242
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:43,350
There is an old man
I am supposed to care for.

243
00:19:43,517 --> 00:19:45,018
I wanted to ask...

244
00:19:45,227 --> 00:19:48,021
Pardon me, but he has wet his pants.

245
00:19:48,605 --> 00:19:52,860
I wanted to know if I change him,
will it count as a sin?

246
00:19:53,944 --> 00:19:55,696
No one is here.

247
00:19:57,114 --> 00:20:02,286
He's 70 or 80 years old and he's senile...

248
00:20:06,748 --> 00:20:10,961
The urgency is that the poor guy has been
sitting like this for half an hour.

249
00:20:11,545 --> 00:20:12,671
I can...

250
00:20:22,806 --> 00:20:24,391
I won't tell Dad.

251
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:27,477
My angel.

252
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,648
Get up.

253
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:35,611
Open your legs.

254
00:20:36,945 --> 00:20:39,740
Okay, now take off your pants.

255
00:20:58,175 --> 00:20:59,176
Card!

256
00:21:10,354 --> 00:21:11,521
Everyone's staring.

257
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,190
Let them.

258
00:21:13,523 --> 00:21:15,400
- How much?
- 37.5.

259
00:21:15,484 --> 00:21:17,653
- Any change?
- He didn't give it.

260
00:21:17,736 --> 00:21:20,155
- You asked?
- It's his tip.

261
00:21:20,322 --> 00:21:22,074
Tip? Sir, wait one sec.

262
00:21:23,241 --> 00:21:26,161
A tip is for when he pumps the gas.
Go get it.

263
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:27,704
- Dad!
- Quick!

264
00:21:29,081 --> 00:21:30,207
Wait.

265
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:54,231
Here.

266
00:21:56,066 --> 00:21:57,109
Keep it.

267
00:21:57,275 --> 00:21:58,276
Really?

268
00:22:14,418 --> 00:22:15,669
Hello.

269
00:22:15,752 --> 00:22:16,962
Hello, Termeh.

270
00:22:17,129 --> 00:22:18,130
Hello.

271
00:22:18,255 --> 00:22:22,259
- Hello, how are you?
- Fine, thank you.

272
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,470
I'll get my books.

273
00:22:26,054 --> 00:22:27,472
And your test results.

274
00:22:27,639 --> 00:22:29,808
- How are you, Ms. Qahraei?
- Fine, thanks, and you?

275
00:22:29,975 --> 00:22:31,768
Fine, thanks.

276
00:22:31,935 --> 00:22:33,311
Sorry we're late.

277
00:22:33,478 --> 00:22:35,230
It's okay. How's your wife?

278
00:22:35,397 --> 00:22:37,899
- Good, thank you.
- We'll get started.

279
00:22:39,317 --> 00:22:41,278
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

280
00:22:42,112 --> 00:22:43,655
How are you, Dad?

281
00:22:44,322 --> 00:22:46,283
- Hi, young lady.
- Hello.

282
00:22:46,783 --> 00:22:48,577
Here's the paper.

283
00:22:51,788 --> 00:22:54,750
Did you read the paper for him
or did he read it for you?

284
00:22:56,418 --> 00:22:57,627
Son...

285
00:22:58,462 --> 00:23:00,297
Ali is married.

286
00:23:00,464 --> 00:23:02,507
- Who's Ali?
- Ali.

287
00:23:02,966 --> 00:23:05,010
Yeah, Ali's married. Termeh, hurry.

288
00:23:05,761 --> 00:23:07,763
His oxygen valve wasn't shut.

289
00:23:08,013 --> 00:23:10,098
He must've opened it.

290
00:23:10,265 --> 00:23:13,310
From tomorrow tighten it a bit more
so he can't open it.

291
00:23:13,477 --> 00:23:14,519
Sorry but...

292
00:23:16,813 --> 00:23:18,148
I can't come anymore.

293
00:23:19,149 --> 00:23:21,193
Didn't we say every day?

294
00:23:21,443 --> 00:23:22,861
The commute is too much.

295
00:23:23,028 --> 00:23:26,323
I turned someone else away. It's 4:00.

296
00:23:27,032 --> 00:23:29,868
How can I find someone now
for tomorrow morning?

297
00:23:30,327 --> 00:23:31,495
It's too much work.

298
00:23:31,661 --> 00:23:34,956
Really I can't. The work is heavy, I can't.

299
00:23:37,459 --> 00:23:39,503
Come to the other room, please.

300
00:23:41,129 --> 00:23:43,381
- Somayeh, where's your scarf?
- It's here.

301
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:48,178
Maybe you're tired 'cause
it's your first day.

302
00:23:48,512 --> 00:23:49,554
No.

303
00:23:50,639 --> 00:23:53,058
You were here for a few minutes. You saw.

304
00:23:54,017 --> 00:23:56,061
Somayeh, come get your bag.

305
00:23:57,145 --> 00:23:59,523
Can you please give me that number?

306
00:24:02,859 --> 00:24:04,653
They also do ultrasounds.

307
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:07,155
It moved a lot today.

308
00:24:07,656 --> 00:24:08,698
Then it's a boy.

309
00:24:08,865 --> 00:24:11,910
It was kicking in Mommy's tummy.

310
00:24:13,495 --> 00:24:15,330
'Cause he wants to come out...

311
00:24:15,497 --> 00:24:17,040
To play with me.

312
00:24:22,879 --> 00:24:25,382
Can you write it in here, please?

313
00:24:26,716 --> 00:24:28,885
Tell them Qahraei sent you.

314
00:24:29,219 --> 00:24:30,887
They know me.

315
00:24:32,556 --> 00:24:34,933
- Is it a man or a woman?
- A woman.

316
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,852
Call first.

317
00:24:37,561 --> 00:24:39,437
You had to tell me yesterday.

318
00:24:39,604 --> 00:24:42,399
How can I leave him
at home alone tomorrow?

319
00:24:43,608 --> 00:24:46,903
- Where does your mom keep the tea?
- I don't know.

320
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:49,739
You should've told me
I'd have to clean him.

321
00:24:49,906 --> 00:24:51,116
Clean him?

322
00:24:52,117 --> 00:24:53,702
He soiled his pants today.

323
00:24:58,748 --> 00:25:01,209
It's not right for me to clean him.

324
00:25:07,591 --> 00:25:10,260
Please pay me for today so I can go.

325
00:25:21,396 --> 00:25:23,148
He always said when he had to go.

326
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:29,070
There are companies you can call
for a male helper.

327
00:25:29,905 --> 00:25:32,657
I can't just let anyone into my home.

328
00:25:34,284 --> 00:25:35,327
Here.

329
00:25:36,661 --> 00:25:37,996
Count it, please.

330
00:25:38,163 --> 00:25:39,956
Sorry, but it's a religious issue.

331
00:25:40,123 --> 00:25:41,166
It's okay.

332
00:25:41,333 --> 00:25:43,293
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

333
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:44,461
Bye.

334
00:25:44,628 --> 00:25:45,795
Goodbye.

335
00:25:54,971 --> 00:25:56,014
Yes?

336
00:25:56,097 --> 00:25:57,933
I wanted to know if it is okay for me

337
00:25:58,183 --> 00:26:00,810
to give your number to my husband

338
00:26:00,977 --> 00:26:02,938
and tell him I got it out of the paper.

339
00:26:03,104 --> 00:26:05,315
For the housework and your father.

340
00:26:05,482 --> 00:26:09,277
Give him the job description
and if he agrees tell him to come...

341
00:26:09,444 --> 00:26:11,488
I don't want to tell him I know you.

342
00:26:11,655 --> 00:26:13,156
I didn't tell him I was coming here.

343
00:26:14,282 --> 00:26:18,119
Then tell him to call me
or tell him to come here tonight.

344
00:26:18,286 --> 00:26:20,455
It's late for tonight.

345
00:26:20,622 --> 00:26:22,207
I'll come tomorrow.

346
00:26:22,832 --> 00:26:25,210
Just don't give the job to anyone else.

347
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,462
You'll see with him for the money.

348
00:26:27,629 --> 00:26:30,840
That's not a problem. Tell him to call me.
I will arrange to meet him.

349
00:26:31,007 --> 00:26:33,468
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. Bye.

350
00:26:33,843 --> 00:26:35,178
And thank you.

351
00:26:45,689 --> 00:26:47,190
Mr. Lavasani?

352
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,151
Go ahead.

353
00:27:09,754 --> 00:27:11,715
Hello. I am Samadi.

354
00:27:11,881 --> 00:27:13,758
- I called about the job.
- Yes, how are you?

355
00:27:13,925 --> 00:27:14,926
Sorry I'm late.

356
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:17,512
It's okay. Where did you work before?

357
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:19,389
I was a cobbler.

358
00:27:19,556 --> 00:27:21,725
And you're okay with cleaning him?

359
00:27:21,933 --> 00:27:23,059
With what?

360
00:27:23,268 --> 00:27:25,562
Since yesterday he's been soiling himself.

361
00:27:26,855 --> 00:27:29,065
I'll treat him like my own father.

362
00:27:29,441 --> 00:27:32,610
But you'll be alone with him
and you have to really watch him.

363
00:27:32,777 --> 00:27:33,945
Your wife won't be there?

364
00:27:34,446 --> 00:27:36,364
No, I am single for now.

365
00:27:39,034 --> 00:27:42,078
Excuse me but isn't 300,000
too little for this work?

366
00:27:42,746 --> 00:27:44,247
How much did you have in mind?

367
00:27:44,706 --> 00:27:46,249
Maybe if you could pay 400,000...

368
00:27:46,583 --> 00:27:48,084
I really can't pay that.

369
00:27:48,626 --> 00:27:49,919
I'll come for a few days.

370
00:27:50,086 --> 00:27:53,089
If you like my work,
add something to the 300,000.

371
00:27:53,256 --> 00:27:55,467
- If not don't pay me.
- Here's the address.

372
00:27:55,633 --> 00:27:56,968
I can even start today.

373
00:27:57,260 --> 00:28:01,097
No, there's someone there today.
Start tomorrow and bring an ID.

374
00:28:01,473 --> 00:28:02,724
Like what?

375
00:28:02,891 --> 00:28:05,894
Any legal ID will do.

376
00:28:06,853 --> 00:28:07,854
Pious?

377
00:28:07,937 --> 00:28:09,522
Worshipper.

378
00:28:09,939 --> 00:28:10,940
Barren?

379
00:28:11,274 --> 00:28:12,275
Sandbar.

380
00:28:12,901 --> 00:28:13,901
Desert!

381
00:28:13,943 --> 00:28:14,944
Desert.

382
00:28:15,153 --> 00:28:16,154
Insurrection?

383
00:28:16,488 --> 00:28:17,655
Rebellion.

384
00:28:19,407 --> 00:28:20,408
Doorbell?

385
00:28:20,492 --> 00:28:21,951
- Razieh.
- No!

386
00:28:22,243 --> 00:28:23,243
Her husband.

387
00:28:23,286 --> 00:28:24,329
Yes.

388
00:28:28,958 --> 00:28:31,920
Give the Persian version of
the following words...

389
00:28:32,087 --> 00:28:34,130
- "Maquette"?
- Nemunak.

390
00:28:34,464 --> 00:28:36,758
- "Compote"?
- Khoshaab.

391
00:28:36,841 --> 00:28:40,011
- "Guarantee"?
- Tazmin, zemanat.

392
00:28:40,095 --> 00:28:41,971
That's Arabic, not Persian.

393
00:28:42,138 --> 00:28:44,015
That's what my teacher said.

394
00:28:44,474 --> 00:28:45,767
Don't give me that.

395
00:28:46,351 --> 00:28:50,313
What's wrong is wrong,
no matter who says what.

396
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:55,318
- For "guarantee" write...
- She'll deduct points.

397
00:28:55,485 --> 00:28:56,528
That's okay, let her.

398
00:28:57,862 --> 00:28:59,489
Write poshtvaneh.

399
00:29:00,323 --> 00:29:01,658
Poshtvaneh.

400
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,543
Hello.

401
00:29:19,509 --> 00:29:22,846
What happened?
Your husband was supposed to come today.

402
00:29:23,012 --> 00:29:24,514
Sorry, he couldn't make it.

403
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,808
What about tomorrow?

404
00:29:27,183 --> 00:29:29,394
I don't know. If he doesn't I'll come.

405
00:29:29,561 --> 00:29:32,313
I hope he won't change his mind every day.

406
00:29:32,689 --> 00:29:34,566
No, poor guy wanted to come.

407
00:29:34,732 --> 00:29:38,987
Last night, one of his creditors came
with an officer and took him away.

408
00:29:39,195 --> 00:29:42,073
Yes, but if something comes up
and he can't make it,

409
00:29:42,323 --> 00:29:43,658
I need to know in advance.

410
00:29:43,825 --> 00:29:45,827
No, he will definitely come.

411
00:29:46,369 --> 00:29:50,707
I'll go see the creditor and beg him

412
00:29:50,915 --> 00:29:52,417
to release him.

413
00:29:52,876 --> 00:29:55,211
Please lock the door behind me.

414
00:29:55,378 --> 00:29:56,588
Goodbye.

415
00:30:36,586 --> 00:30:37,629
Hi.

416
00:30:45,803 --> 00:30:47,889
Don't step on it. It is dirty.

417
00:30:50,433 --> 00:30:52,310
Go take the garbage out.

418
00:30:55,104 --> 00:30:56,314
Can you?

419
00:30:57,482 --> 00:30:58,775
Yes.

420
00:31:18,086 --> 00:31:20,630
Where will I get you a clean dress?

421
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:24,300
Take it off!

422
00:31:25,301 --> 00:31:26,511
Take it off!

423
00:31:31,015 --> 00:31:32,183
Mommy,

424
00:31:32,684 --> 00:31:34,143
he's not in his room.

425
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:36,604
- What?
- He's not in his room.

426
00:31:38,147 --> 00:31:39,983
Go look in the bathroom.

427
00:33:04,442 --> 00:33:05,485
Like that.

428
00:33:05,568 --> 00:33:08,112
Block the ball. Okay?

429
00:33:26,589 --> 00:33:27,590
Give me five.

430
00:33:29,092 --> 00:33:32,762
- Grandpa, whose side are you on?
- He's the manager.

431
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:41,771
Did you see that?

432
00:34:05,294 --> 00:34:06,587
What's wrong?

433
00:34:07,296 --> 00:34:08,589
Sit here.

434
00:34:19,767 --> 00:34:20,977
You okay?

435
00:34:38,703 --> 00:34:40,830
Where've you been?

436
00:34:40,997 --> 00:34:44,041
Poor thing has been
waiting for half an hour.

437
00:34:44,459 --> 00:34:46,335
It's a long commute.

438
00:34:46,502 --> 00:34:47,545
Hello.

439
00:34:50,006 --> 00:34:52,383
Also, take the garbage out with the bin.

440
00:34:53,009 --> 00:34:55,386
The bags tear and dirty the stairs.

441
00:34:55,553 --> 00:34:59,056
Yesterday I got dizzy.
I dropped the bag and it tore.

442
00:34:59,223 --> 00:35:00,683
I'll mop the stairs.

443
00:35:02,393 --> 00:35:03,561
Go in.

444
00:35:03,728 --> 00:35:05,188
Let us in.

445
00:35:11,152 --> 00:35:12,695
Let me close the door.

446
00:35:42,183 --> 00:35:44,227
- Mrs...
- She's not there?

447
00:35:45,394 --> 00:35:47,897
- What's her kid's name?
- Somayeh.

448
00:35:50,024 --> 00:35:52,777
Don't sit there. It's wet.

449
00:35:53,444 --> 00:35:54,737
Somayeh!

450
00:35:56,697 --> 00:35:58,032
Somayeh!

451
00:36:10,294 --> 00:36:11,754
Mrs. Kalani!

452
00:36:12,588 --> 00:36:14,048
Knock.

453
00:36:16,384 --> 00:36:17,718
Grandpa!

454
00:36:18,302 --> 00:36:19,762
Mrs. Kalani!

455
00:36:21,764 --> 00:36:22,890
Yes.

456
00:36:23,057 --> 00:36:24,767
- Hello, how are you?
- Fine, thanks.

457
00:36:24,934 --> 00:36:27,228
Did you see the lady that works for us?

458
00:36:27,395 --> 00:36:29,272
She was mopping the stairs.

459
00:36:29,438 --> 00:36:31,649
- When?
- Before noon.

460
00:36:31,899 --> 00:36:34,652
- She's not there?
- No. Thanks.

461
00:36:35,111 --> 00:36:37,905
Wait here. I'll get the keys from the car.

462
00:36:51,419 --> 00:36:53,129
What's wrong?

463
00:36:54,338 --> 00:36:55,339
Dad?

464
00:37:17,778 --> 00:37:19,155
Get his feet.

465
00:37:26,829 --> 00:37:28,998
Dad, get up, look at Termeh.

466
00:37:29,457 --> 00:37:30,458
Dad!

467
00:37:45,139 --> 00:37:46,515
He's breathing.

468
00:37:46,682 --> 00:37:47,850
Don't worry.

469
00:37:59,362 --> 00:38:02,573
Does your arm hurt?
Help me take his shirt off.

470
00:38:05,701 --> 00:38:07,078
Move your arm.

471
00:38:07,912 --> 00:38:09,413
Does it hurt?

472
00:38:12,917 --> 00:38:14,418
Take a step.

473
00:38:16,003 --> 00:38:17,254
Walk.

474
00:38:17,546 --> 00:38:19,715
Let's get the paper, Dad.

475
00:38:20,174 --> 00:38:21,550
Move your leg.

476
00:38:24,261 --> 00:38:27,765
Does it hurt? Let me see what's happened.

477
00:38:28,724 --> 00:38:30,685
Who did this to you?

478
00:38:32,728 --> 00:38:35,356
I want to see if your legs are okay.

479
00:38:37,233 --> 00:38:40,403
Let me... Honey, go to your room.

480
00:38:40,569 --> 00:38:43,239
- Has something happened?
- No. Go out.

481
00:38:45,366 --> 00:38:46,909
She's gone, Dad.

482
00:38:47,076 --> 00:38:49,578
Let me see your legs.

483
00:38:51,914 --> 00:38:53,249
Take them off.

484
00:39:13,436 --> 00:39:14,562
Scum!

485
00:39:18,065 --> 00:39:20,901
- Honey, did you take money from the drawer?
- No.

486
00:39:20,985 --> 00:39:22,737
Okay, go to the kitchen.

487
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:29,660
I told you to go to the kitchen.

488
00:39:29,827 --> 00:39:32,246
You saw that nothing happened.

489
00:39:32,955 --> 00:39:35,833
Go on... Close the door.

490
00:40:07,156 --> 00:40:08,157
Hello.

491
00:40:10,951 --> 00:40:12,119
Come here.

492
00:40:13,662 --> 00:40:15,498
Mommy, I'm thirsty.

493
00:40:23,672 --> 00:40:24,673
Watch him.

494
00:40:27,134 --> 00:40:28,135
Hello.

495
00:40:29,011 --> 00:40:30,346
Where were you?

496
00:40:32,848 --> 00:40:35,851
Something came up. I had to go out.

497
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:38,354
You had no right to go.

498
00:40:38,521 --> 00:40:41,732
- He was asleep.
- So you lock the door and leave?

499
00:40:44,151 --> 00:40:45,694
I was gone briefly.

500
00:40:45,861 --> 00:40:48,739
Briefly? You're lying.

501
00:40:48,906 --> 00:40:51,075
He was dying when I got here!

502
00:40:51,242 --> 00:40:53,494
He always naps at this time so I...

503
00:40:53,661 --> 00:40:55,913
So you do this every day?

504
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,541
Lock the door and run your errands?

505
00:40:58,707 --> 00:41:00,543
No. I swear to God, today I had to.

506
00:41:00,709 --> 00:41:03,712
- Why did you tie his hand?
- Go wait outside.

507
00:41:06,215 --> 00:41:08,217
Was this our agreement?

508
00:41:08,384 --> 00:41:09,593
I had to go.

509
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:12,012
I had no choice.

510
00:41:12,179 --> 00:41:13,556
Thanks a lot!

511
00:41:13,722 --> 00:41:15,933
You tie his hand every day

512
00:41:16,183 --> 00:41:17,726
and go do your own stuff.

513
00:41:17,893 --> 00:41:18,894
Is he okay?

514
00:41:19,061 --> 00:41:21,564
Thanks a lot!

515
00:41:22,773 --> 00:41:24,400
Wait outside, sweetie.

516
00:41:24,567 --> 00:41:26,569
Go check on Grandpa.

517
00:41:29,029 --> 00:41:30,781
Why did you go in that room?

518
00:41:31,157 --> 00:41:32,158
Which room?

519
00:41:32,366 --> 00:41:35,744
Which room?
The one you took the money from.

520
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:38,455
I took money from that room?

521
00:41:38,706 --> 00:41:40,916
- Don't I pay you?
- I took money?

522
00:41:41,083 --> 00:41:42,126
You didn't take it?

523
00:41:42,209 --> 00:41:44,420
I swear I didn't take any money.

524
00:41:44,587 --> 00:41:45,588
Get out.

525
00:41:46,463 --> 00:41:49,258
Sir, I'm swearing on our martyrs.

526
00:41:52,094 --> 00:41:54,597
You say I took money.

527
00:41:54,763 --> 00:41:58,934
Here, look in my bag.
If I took it, it should be here.

528
00:41:59,101 --> 00:42:00,269
Here, take this.

529
00:42:00,436 --> 00:42:02,938
Give me my bag.

530
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,480
I am swearing on our martyrs
that I didn't go there.

531
00:42:06,609 --> 00:42:07,943
Here's my bag.

532
00:42:08,235 --> 00:42:09,653
What are you doing?

533
00:42:09,904 --> 00:42:10,905
I didn't go there.

534
00:42:10,988 --> 00:42:14,450
I'm swearing on our martyrs
that I didn't step into that room.

535
00:42:14,617 --> 00:42:16,619
- Get out.
- You're saying...

536
00:42:16,785 --> 00:42:20,122
What did I do? Don't touch me!

537
00:42:20,623 --> 00:42:22,625
I won't touch you. Get out.

538
00:42:24,293 --> 00:42:27,755
I won't leave till I get what I deserve!

539
00:42:27,922 --> 00:42:30,633
What you deserve is for me to kick you out.

540
00:42:30,799 --> 00:42:33,761
Because of her I won't.

541
00:42:33,928 --> 00:42:37,765
Get out!
I'm doing you a favor by throwing you out.

542
00:42:37,973 --> 00:42:40,517
Tell me what's happened to him.

543
00:42:40,976 --> 00:42:42,686
It's my house, I want you out.

544
00:42:42,853 --> 00:42:45,314
Fine, but it's not right.

545
00:42:45,814 --> 00:42:47,775
- It displeases God.
- Out!

546
00:42:48,817 --> 00:42:50,319
That's it.

547
00:42:53,614 --> 00:42:54,657
Dad.

548
00:43:05,334 --> 00:43:07,962
Open the door. It's me.
I want to come in...

549
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:11,674
This is how you watch him?

550
00:43:15,552 --> 00:43:17,054
Open the door.

551
00:43:18,514 --> 00:43:20,557
Go check what's behind you.

552
00:43:21,016 --> 00:43:22,184
Have a look.

553
00:43:23,852 --> 00:43:24,852
Open the door!

554
00:43:24,895 --> 00:43:27,189
It's no use shouting.

555
00:43:28,148 --> 00:43:30,859
This is why I asked you to watch him.

556
00:43:31,026 --> 00:43:33,654
Maybe his leg hurts and he can't get up.

557
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:36,573
Grandpa...

558
00:43:38,742 --> 00:43:41,078
Dad, open the door.

559
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:43,998
Open the door, please.

560
00:43:45,749 --> 00:43:48,168
I'm going to push the door open.

561
00:43:48,335 --> 00:43:51,880
It'll hit you, Dad. Move aside.

562
00:43:53,882 --> 00:43:56,844
I'm going to push the door open.

563
00:43:59,555 --> 00:44:02,391
Why do you do this to yourself?

564
00:44:15,195 --> 00:44:16,572
Who told you to come in?

565
00:44:16,739 --> 00:44:19,533
- What happened to him?
- Give me the key. Get out!

566
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:20,909
I didn't steal from you.

567
00:44:21,076 --> 00:44:22,786
You are pissing me off!

568
00:44:22,870 --> 00:44:23,870
I didn't.

569
00:44:23,912 --> 00:44:27,708
- Don't give me that!
- I wouldn't be here now if I had.

570
00:44:27,875 --> 00:44:28,876
Get out.

571
00:44:28,959 --> 00:44:30,461
Pay me for today.

572
00:44:30,586 --> 00:44:33,589
You already took your pay, didn't you?

573
00:44:34,298 --> 00:44:38,427
Since 5:30 this morning
with my daughter... Somayeh!

574
00:44:38,719 --> 00:44:39,928
Sir, wait!

575
00:44:40,095 --> 00:44:41,430
Get out.

576
00:44:41,597 --> 00:44:45,100
I swear I didn't steal.

577
00:44:45,267 --> 00:44:46,769
Get out!

578
00:44:59,573 --> 00:45:00,574
What happened?

579
00:45:05,412 --> 00:45:06,747
What happened?

580
00:45:07,122 --> 00:45:08,457
Sit.

581
00:45:16,006 --> 00:45:17,508
What happened?

582
00:45:20,928 --> 00:45:22,805
Mommy, be careful.

583
00:46:34,668 --> 00:46:36,545
Tell her to work with you on your English.

584
00:46:36,712 --> 00:46:37,838
Bye, Grandpa.

585
00:46:38,589 --> 00:46:40,757
Dad, Termeh said bye.

586
00:46:44,511 --> 00:46:45,596
Careful!

587
00:46:51,351 --> 00:46:52,436
Okay.

588
00:46:55,522 --> 00:46:56,607
What is it?

589
00:46:56,773 --> 00:46:58,108
Mom says come in.

590
00:46:59,193 --> 00:47:00,944
Tell her Grandpa's in the car.

591
00:47:01,111 --> 00:47:02,362
She says it's important.

592
00:47:05,532 --> 00:47:08,952
Not divorced yet and already ignoring us!

593
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:10,579
I'm busy.

594
00:47:10,954 --> 00:47:14,082
People divorce their
wives to get less busy.

595
00:47:14,249 --> 00:47:17,127
Ma'am, these channels have too much static.

596
00:47:17,294 --> 00:47:19,254
Okay, set the ones you can.

597
00:47:20,547 --> 00:47:22,591
- Come and sit.
- Thank you. Simin...

598
00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:28,931
Hi.

599
00:47:31,767 --> 00:47:33,268
Where's Termeh?

600
00:47:33,894 --> 00:47:35,270
In the car with dad.

601
00:47:35,479 --> 00:47:37,105
Then bring him in, too.

602
00:47:37,481 --> 00:47:38,941
No, he is tired.

603
00:47:39,107 --> 00:47:40,400
It's his nap time.

604
00:47:42,277 --> 00:47:43,278
What is it?

605
00:47:43,946 --> 00:47:45,614
Did you have a fight with that woman?

606
00:47:46,823 --> 00:47:47,908
Did she come see you?

607
00:47:48,116 --> 00:47:49,159
Her sister-in-law called.

608
00:47:49,952 --> 00:47:51,620
Shameless!

609
00:47:51,787 --> 00:47:52,955
What did she do?

610
00:47:53,121 --> 00:47:56,500
Tied the old man to the bed
and locked the door.

611
00:47:56,667 --> 00:47:58,335
Went after her own errands.

612
00:47:58,794 --> 00:48:01,338
If I'd gotten there 10 minutes later,
I would've lost him.

613
00:48:01,421 --> 00:48:02,714
Is he okay?

614
00:48:02,798 --> 00:48:04,007
He had fallen off the bed.

615
00:48:04,174 --> 00:48:06,635
I don't know for how long he was like that.

616
00:48:07,010 --> 00:48:08,053
Where had she gone?

617
00:48:08,136 --> 00:48:09,137
How should I know?

618
00:48:09,846 --> 00:48:10,973
She said you hit her.

619
00:48:11,515 --> 00:48:12,558
I hit her?

620
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:15,602
- Nonsense.
- Then why is she in the hospital?

621
00:48:17,938 --> 00:48:19,815
Hospital? Why?

622
00:48:20,649 --> 00:48:22,025
You're asking me?

623
00:48:22,276 --> 00:48:23,777
I just pushed her out of the house.

624
00:48:23,944 --> 00:48:26,196
The sister-in-law called and told me off.

625
00:48:26,989 --> 00:48:27,990
Saying what?

626
00:48:28,198 --> 00:48:30,951
That if she dies,
her blood will be on your hands.

627
00:48:32,995 --> 00:48:33,996
Stuff like that.

628
00:48:35,706 --> 00:48:40,544
- She didn't say what happened?
- I hung up. She started cursing.

629
00:48:43,547 --> 00:48:46,633
That's what you get
for hiring people off the streets.

630
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:51,054
Don't blame me.
I told you I only know her sister-in-law.

631
00:48:51,221 --> 00:48:53,015
Did she say which hospital?

632
00:48:58,520 --> 00:48:59,688
- Hello.
- Yes?

633
00:49:00,689 --> 00:49:01,857
Hold, please.

634
00:49:02,357 --> 00:49:05,902
A woman by the name of Razieh was
brought in tonight.

635
00:49:06,236 --> 00:49:09,698
- What's her family name?
- I don't know. She was admitted earlier.

636
00:49:09,865 --> 00:49:11,033
Why was she brought in?

637
00:49:11,199 --> 00:49:13,994
- They just told us...
- That she was taken to hospital.

638
00:49:14,494 --> 00:49:16,872
I'll call you back. Bye.

639
00:49:17,205 --> 00:49:20,167
Her husband's last name is Samadi.

640
00:49:24,379 --> 00:49:26,006
Razieh Asnaqi?

641
00:49:26,548 --> 00:49:28,717
Is she in her thirties?

642
00:49:31,053 --> 00:49:32,721
She had surgery. She's in post-op.

643
00:49:33,221 --> 00:49:34,306
Why surgery?

644
00:49:35,349 --> 00:49:36,600
She had a miscarriage.

645
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:41,605
Is she okay now?

646
00:49:41,688 --> 00:49:42,939
Hello? Hold.

647
00:49:43,023 --> 00:49:44,024
Yes.

648
00:49:44,107 --> 00:49:46,943
Is her family here?

649
00:49:47,194 --> 00:49:48,514
If they are, they are downstairs.

650
00:49:48,904 --> 00:49:50,197
Thank you.

651
00:49:57,537 --> 00:49:59,247
What did you do to her?

652
00:50:01,083 --> 00:50:02,626
What did I do to her?

653
00:50:23,230 --> 00:50:24,231
Hello.

654
00:50:28,110 --> 00:50:29,611
- How are you?
- Fine, thanks.

655
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:30,946
Hello, ma'am.

656
00:50:31,321 --> 00:50:32,322
How is she?

657
00:50:32,948 --> 00:50:33,949
Who?

658
00:50:34,616 --> 00:50:35,826
Your wife.

659
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:38,829
They took her to the ward.

660
00:50:40,330 --> 00:50:41,623
Do you know her?

661
00:50:41,790 --> 00:50:43,959
- I know her.
- My wife.

662
00:50:44,292 --> 00:50:46,795
- They didn't have sandwiches.
- Hello.

663
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:54,928
Can we see her?

664
00:50:55,095 --> 00:50:57,013
Where do you know her from?

665
00:50:57,305 --> 00:51:01,309
Your sister introduced her to us
for housework.

666
00:51:01,518 --> 00:51:03,103
Thanks a lot!

667
00:51:05,605 --> 00:51:07,085
She was coming to your house to work?

668
00:51:07,441 --> 00:51:08,817
She came for a few days.

669
00:51:09,484 --> 00:51:12,487
Apparently you couldn't come
so she came in your place.

670
00:51:12,696 --> 00:51:14,364
Come sit and eat something.

671
00:51:14,656 --> 00:51:17,659
You mean she took care of your father?

672
00:51:17,993 --> 00:51:19,619
Just for a few days.

673
00:51:20,162 --> 00:51:21,496
Two or three days.

674
00:51:21,663 --> 00:51:24,332
Why didn't you tell me this at the bank?

675
00:51:26,710 --> 00:51:28,712
I thought she would tell you.

676
00:51:29,963 --> 00:51:31,715
Why have you come here now?

677
00:51:31,882 --> 00:51:33,800
To see if we can do something.

678
00:51:33,967 --> 00:51:34,968
Do what?

679
00:51:35,135 --> 00:51:37,637
Help. We were worried.

680
00:51:37,804 --> 00:51:39,347
Did she fall?

681
00:51:40,015 --> 00:51:42,476
Come with me. I'll explain.

682
00:51:43,310 --> 00:51:45,854
I'll explain to you... Come with me.

683
00:51:46,354 --> 00:51:48,523
I understand your situation.

684
00:51:48,690 --> 00:51:51,693
You kill her child
and now you've come to do what?

685
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:52,986
I'm really sorry.

686
00:51:53,153 --> 00:51:55,655
I'm sorry won't be a child to her.

687
00:51:55,864 --> 00:51:57,365
Just tell me one thing.

688
00:51:57,532 --> 00:51:58,992
I'll explain outside.

689
00:51:59,367 --> 00:52:01,870
Wait! Why didn't you tell me that day?

690
00:52:02,329 --> 00:52:04,080
I told you. I thought she...

691
00:52:07,417 --> 00:52:09,920
You live alone in that house.

692
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:13,548
Let him go.

693
00:52:14,382 --> 00:52:15,884
Calm down.

694
00:52:16,927 --> 00:52:19,221
This is a hospital.

695
00:52:20,889 --> 00:52:22,182
Don't!

696
00:52:22,349 --> 00:52:23,350
Stop!

697
00:52:27,771 --> 00:52:29,856
Why the hell did you come here?

698
00:52:33,276 --> 00:52:34,861
Let me see.

699
00:52:35,403 --> 00:52:37,656
- My own sister?
- I'm sorry.

700
00:52:37,739 --> 00:52:38,782
Forgive me.

701
00:52:38,865 --> 00:52:39,866
Let me see.

702
00:52:43,745 --> 00:52:45,705
Come out here.

703
00:52:47,415 --> 00:52:48,416
I want to talk to you.

704
00:52:51,461 --> 00:52:53,588
Please, I beg you. Hojjat!

705
00:53:01,304 --> 00:53:04,099
Do you want your seat down?

706
00:53:04,432 --> 00:53:05,433
No.

707
00:53:06,810 --> 00:53:10,105
I'll take you home
then I'll get Dad and Termeh.

708
00:53:11,773 --> 00:53:12,983
No.

709
00:53:14,442 --> 00:53:15,777
No?

710
00:53:16,987 --> 00:53:19,739
You want to go to your parents' like this?

711
00:53:21,449 --> 00:53:24,160
It's over. You're coming home tonight.

712
00:53:27,247 --> 00:53:28,290
I don't want to.

713
00:53:38,633 --> 00:53:40,135
Where are you going?

714
00:53:47,475 --> 00:53:48,518
Cell phone.

715
00:53:50,103 --> 00:53:51,479
Hand it in.

716
00:55:00,715 --> 00:55:02,884
Did you hear his complaint?

717
00:55:03,051 --> 00:55:04,260
It was the 13th.

718
00:55:05,345 --> 00:55:07,931
I'm sorry. I was really upset when I heard.

719
00:55:08,181 --> 00:55:10,684
- I went to the hospital.
- Then you admit it.

720
00:55:12,268 --> 00:55:13,979
Is this the medical examiner's report?

721
00:55:14,062 --> 00:55:18,525
It is the hospital report that we took

722
00:55:18,692 --> 00:55:20,694
to the medical examiner.

723
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:22,487
Four and half months, male.

724
00:55:22,570 --> 00:55:23,905
Please explain.

725
00:55:24,364 --> 00:55:26,574
I accept that I was a bit rough.

726
00:55:26,741 --> 00:55:28,410
By rough you mean you pushed her?

727
00:55:28,618 --> 00:55:31,621
No. I tried to get her out of my house.

728
00:55:32,747 --> 00:55:35,291
Be clear. Your charge is murder.

729
00:55:36,459 --> 00:55:39,129
It was 19 weeks old. A full human being.

730
00:55:40,755 --> 00:55:43,133
I didn't intend to push her.

731
00:55:43,299 --> 00:55:45,593
I wanted her to leave
so I could close the door.

732
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:47,721
- You didn't push me?
- Ma'am, please.

733
00:55:47,929 --> 00:55:50,140
If I knew she were pregnant,

734
00:55:50,306 --> 00:55:53,768
I wouldn't even have tried to get
her out of the house.

735
00:55:54,394 --> 00:55:56,271
I just wanted to close the door.

736
00:55:56,646 --> 00:55:58,273
Do you accept his explanation?

737
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:02,318
He didn't push. He grabbed me here
and threw me and I fell on the stairs.

738
00:56:02,569 --> 00:56:04,612
I didn't throw you.

739
00:56:04,779 --> 00:56:07,449
I wanted to get you out of my house.

740
00:56:07,657 --> 00:56:10,577
- Who throws out a pregnant woman?
- I didn't know.

741
00:56:10,785 --> 00:56:11,828
Why are you lying?

742
00:56:11,911 --> 00:56:14,122
I found out in the hospital.

743
00:56:14,748 --> 00:56:17,292
Your Honor, can't everyone tell

744
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:20,628
from the body of a woman
that she is pregnant?

745
00:56:21,129 --> 00:56:22,289
Four to five months pregnant.

746
00:56:22,338 --> 00:56:24,007
When would I even see you?

747
00:56:24,257 --> 00:56:27,260
I was already gone
or leaving when she'd come.

748
00:56:27,427 --> 00:56:30,346
When I'd come, she looked like this.

749
00:56:30,513 --> 00:56:32,849
Always with the chador.

750
00:56:33,016 --> 00:56:34,768
How can anyone tell she was pregnant?

751
00:56:34,934 --> 00:56:37,103
He can claim that he couldn't guess.

752
00:56:37,604 --> 00:56:41,483
I didn't think a pregnant woman
would come for this kind of work.

753
00:56:42,776 --> 00:56:45,862
Your Honor, I spoke of my pregnancy

754
00:56:46,112 --> 00:56:49,324
in front of him, his
daughter and her tutor.

755
00:56:49,532 --> 00:56:51,618
They all heard it.

756
00:56:51,785 --> 00:56:53,661
When? I don't remember.

757
00:56:53,828 --> 00:56:55,705
No, of course you wouldn't remember.

758
00:56:55,872 --> 00:56:58,666
The issue isn't that I knew or not.

759
00:56:58,875 --> 00:57:00,376
Yes.

760
00:57:00,627 --> 00:57:02,295
If it's proven that you knew,

761
00:57:02,462 --> 00:57:04,839
the court can request
a prison term of one to three years.

762
00:57:08,051 --> 00:57:09,511
- Well?
- What?

763
00:57:10,553 --> 00:57:12,180
No, I didn't know.

764
00:57:12,347 --> 00:57:15,391
His daughter's tutor can testify.

765
00:57:15,558 --> 00:57:16,976
Can she come in tomorrow?

766
00:57:17,143 --> 00:57:19,521
I don't want her or the school involved.

767
00:57:19,687 --> 00:57:22,023
It's not good for my daughter.

768
00:57:22,190 --> 00:57:24,859
You trash. You've killed my child.

769
00:57:25,026 --> 00:57:26,361
It's bad for your child?

770
00:57:26,528 --> 00:57:30,115
She matters but ours was an animal?

771
00:57:30,198 --> 00:57:34,869
- Don't insult...
- Am I insulting? He took my pregnant wife...

772
00:57:35,078 --> 00:57:36,371
Quiet or I'll put you in prison.

773
00:57:36,871 --> 00:57:39,374
Please, he's a bit hot-tempered.

774
00:57:40,375 --> 00:57:42,544
Hot-tempered?

775
00:57:42,752 --> 00:57:47,507
I should sue you for working for
a single man we don't even know.

776
00:57:47,715 --> 00:57:51,553
I wanted to help with the bills.
He hasn't worked for months.

777
00:57:52,345 --> 00:57:54,889
The tutor has to come in as a witness.

778
00:57:55,098 --> 00:57:57,725
Call her to come in tomorrow.

779
00:58:00,353 --> 00:58:03,690
Your Honor, I'm here today for one thing.

780
00:58:04,190 --> 00:58:07,068
I lost my child but it didn't hurt as much

781
00:58:07,235 --> 00:58:10,071
as when he accused me of being a thief.

782
00:58:10,238 --> 00:58:11,322
We're thieves?

783
00:58:11,406 --> 00:58:12,824
If we were thieves,

784
00:58:12,907 --> 00:58:16,244
we wouldn't come to wipe your father's ass.

785
00:58:16,411 --> 00:58:18,913
Do you have proof that she stole?

786
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:20,415
I didn't say she stole.

787
00:58:20,790 --> 00:58:23,084
Money was missing

788
00:58:23,543 --> 00:58:26,045
and it was the same amount that I pay her.

789
00:58:26,254 --> 00:58:27,255
Is that why you fought?

790
00:58:27,547 --> 00:58:29,048
He accused her of stealing.

791
00:58:29,257 --> 00:58:32,093
Your Honor, my father has Alzheimer's.

792
00:58:32,594 --> 00:58:36,389
She tied his hand to the bed
and left the house.

793
00:58:36,764 --> 00:58:38,266
That day I came home early.

794
00:58:38,433 --> 00:58:41,144
I saw him on the floor with his hand tied.

795
00:58:41,394 --> 00:58:42,770
I thought he had died.

796
00:58:43,438 --> 00:58:47,775
She came back
and I'm not saying I wasn't angry,

797
00:58:47,859 --> 00:58:48,860
I was.

798
00:58:48,943 --> 00:58:51,613
I told her to leave and she wouldn't.

799
00:58:51,821 --> 00:58:53,781
Where should I have gone?

800
00:58:53,948 --> 00:58:55,450
He accused me of stealing.

801
00:58:55,617 --> 00:58:58,244
If I hadn't asked for the money and left,

802
00:58:58,411 --> 00:59:00,580
he would've thought I had stolen.

803
00:59:00,788 --> 00:59:02,123
Sit down.

804
00:59:02,582 --> 00:59:04,626
- Was your father hurt?
- Yes, he was.

805
00:59:04,834 --> 00:59:08,463
How hurt? If he had been, he
would've filed a complaint.

806
00:59:08,630 --> 00:59:09,964
Yes, he was hurt.

807
00:59:10,131 --> 00:59:11,591
Where are you going?

808
00:59:11,758 --> 00:59:15,011
I'm going to check on my child.

809
00:59:15,345 --> 00:59:16,387
Come back quick.

810
00:59:16,638 --> 00:59:17,972
Close the door.

811
01:00:01,557 --> 01:00:02,684
What's taking so long?

812
01:00:03,768 --> 01:00:06,854
I'm not well. You go, I'll come.

813
01:00:07,063 --> 01:00:08,856
He says you locked up his father and left.

814
01:00:10,858 --> 01:00:11,859
What should I say?

815
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:14,612
Say? If he complains you'll be charged.

816
01:00:16,781 --> 01:00:18,283
Where's Somayeh?

817
01:00:18,866 --> 01:00:19,951
Over there.

818
01:00:20,201 --> 01:00:22,036
Go. I'll get her and come.

819
01:00:22,620 --> 01:00:23,871
Let's go.

820
01:00:41,222 --> 01:00:42,390
Yes?

821
01:00:44,392 --> 01:00:47,478
He was sleeping.
I locked the door to keep him in.

822
01:00:47,895 --> 01:00:52,108
Even he would lock the door
and leave me the key.

823
01:00:52,275 --> 01:00:53,651
I saw that he does it so I...

824
01:00:53,818 --> 01:00:55,820
He says you tied him to the bed.

825
01:00:58,656 --> 01:01:02,452
I was afraid he would wake up
and do something to himself.

826
01:01:02,618 --> 01:01:05,663
I was afraid for him.

827
01:01:05,913 --> 01:01:08,124
Why did you leave?

828
01:01:08,291 --> 01:01:10,335
- So you should hit her?
- Quiet!

829
01:01:10,585 --> 01:01:12,420
Who said you could touch my wife?

830
01:01:12,503 --> 01:01:13,588
Sir, get out.

831
01:01:13,671 --> 01:01:16,090
They don't care about honor, I do.

832
01:01:16,424 --> 01:01:18,968
- Don't be offensive.
- Leave the room.

833
01:01:22,430 --> 01:01:24,349
I want to file a complaint
against this woman.

834
01:01:24,474 --> 01:01:25,516
Write your complaint.

835
01:01:25,767 --> 01:01:29,354
Take your father to the medical examiner.
If he's hurt get a report.

836
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:31,272
What happens to our complaint?

837
01:01:31,689 --> 01:01:33,358
Sign this and leave.

838
01:01:33,691 --> 01:01:35,360
You have to post bail.

839
01:01:35,485 --> 01:01:36,778
What for?

840
01:01:37,278 --> 01:01:39,822
You're charged with murder.

841
01:01:39,989 --> 01:01:41,991
I can't let you leave.

842
01:01:42,158 --> 01:01:44,702
The blood money is 40 million.

843
01:01:44,869 --> 01:01:46,996
How am I going to post bail?

844
01:01:47,622 --> 01:01:51,125
I live at my dad's. He has Alzheimer's.

845
01:01:51,501 --> 01:01:53,378
If you don't you'll go to jail.

846
01:01:53,544 --> 01:01:56,714
My father can't even come here.

847
01:01:56,964 --> 01:01:58,383
He's sick.

848
01:01:58,549 --> 01:01:59,801
Please don't.

849
01:01:59,967 --> 01:02:02,387
I can't go to jail.

850
01:02:02,637 --> 01:02:04,889
I've left him at home to come here.

851
01:02:05,390 --> 01:02:07,308
I can't go to jail.

852
01:02:07,475 --> 01:02:08,810
I can't post bail.

853
01:02:08,976 --> 01:02:10,603
It's not in my hands. It's the law.

854
01:02:10,686 --> 01:02:11,896
Wait one second.

855
01:02:11,979 --> 01:02:14,690
What should I do with my dad?

856
01:02:14,899 --> 01:02:18,152
I left him at home
and locked the door to come here.

857
01:02:18,319 --> 01:02:19,904
My child will come home from school.

858
01:02:20,071 --> 01:02:21,364
Please. What are you writing?

859
01:02:21,489 --> 01:02:24,325
Don't waste time. Go make your call.

860
01:02:24,492 --> 01:02:26,536
I can't go to jail. I won't go.

861
01:02:27,078 --> 01:02:28,496
Write what you want!

862
01:02:28,704 --> 01:02:29,747
Go get an officer.

863
01:02:30,164 --> 01:02:31,874
What for? Don't.

864
01:02:32,041 --> 01:02:34,502
I'm begging you.

865
01:02:34,669 --> 01:02:36,504
Please don't write it.

866
01:02:37,255 --> 01:02:40,091
My life will be ruined.

867
01:02:40,258 --> 01:02:42,677
Don't waste time. Go make your call.

868
01:02:45,513 --> 01:02:49,392
Hello, Termeh. I'm stuck here.
They're keeping me tonight.

869
01:02:49,559 --> 01:02:53,563
Don't worry. It's nothing.
But you'll be alone tonight.

870
01:02:53,729 --> 01:02:57,692
Take care of the house.
Take Grandpa to the bathroom regularly.

871
01:02:57,859 --> 01:03:00,027
Take care of yourself.
I'll call you tomorrow.

872
01:03:32,768 --> 01:03:36,397
If you hadn't left, Dad
wouldn't be in jail.

873
01:03:36,564 --> 01:03:38,941
Your dad's not in jail because of me.

874
01:03:39,942 --> 01:03:41,736
He hit a pregnant woman.

875
01:03:41,903 --> 01:03:43,488
She came 'cause you left.

876
01:03:44,322 --> 01:03:46,449
How upset he was that I left.

877
01:03:47,241 --> 01:03:49,577
He knew you weren't really leaving.

878
01:03:50,912 --> 01:03:52,497
Did you tell him?

879
01:03:52,580 --> 01:03:53,956
No, he knew.

880
01:03:54,999 --> 01:03:56,167
Tell me the truth.

881
01:03:56,334 --> 01:03:57,752
You told him?

882
01:04:05,510 --> 01:04:08,346
Get your stuff. We're going to Grandma's.

883
01:04:08,429 --> 01:04:09,680
What about Grandpa?

884
01:04:09,764 --> 01:04:11,057
We'll take him, too.

885
01:04:11,140 --> 01:04:13,184
I have homework. I'm not coming.

886
01:04:13,976 --> 01:04:16,521
- You'll be on your own...
- Fine.

887
01:04:17,772 --> 01:04:20,441
You'd better not call.

888
01:04:31,869 --> 01:04:34,664
He doesn't even ask me to stay.

889
01:04:35,206 --> 01:04:37,124
He doesn't refuse to divorce.

890
01:04:37,667 --> 01:04:41,295
After having lived together for 14 years.

891
01:05:23,254 --> 01:05:24,255
Dad!

892
01:05:27,008 --> 01:05:29,010
What are you doing here?

893
01:05:30,177 --> 01:05:31,679
Who are you with?

894
01:05:32,888 --> 01:05:35,349
Didn't you have an exam?

895
01:05:35,516 --> 01:05:37,184
No, it's tomorrow.

896
01:05:37,893 --> 01:05:39,520
Who are you with?

897
01:05:44,066 --> 01:05:45,192
Hello.

898
01:05:46,027 --> 01:05:48,529
Shouldn't you tell us you're in trouble

899
01:05:48,613 --> 01:05:50,364
so we can bail you out?

900
01:05:50,531 --> 01:05:52,199
I didn't want to trouble you.

901
01:05:52,366 --> 01:05:53,909
Silly man.

902
01:05:54,118 --> 01:05:56,120
- Sit.
- No, ma'am, he has a hearing.

903
01:06:00,124 --> 01:06:01,584
Where's Grandpa?

904
01:06:01,709 --> 01:06:03,210
He's safe.

905
01:06:03,711 --> 01:06:06,255
What are they saying?

906
01:06:06,922 --> 01:06:10,217
"My child" as if their 18-year old son

907
01:06:10,384 --> 01:06:12,219
was stabbed to death.

908
01:06:12,386 --> 01:06:13,721
Did you speak to them?

909
01:06:13,888 --> 01:06:16,557
You can't even speak to the man.

910
01:06:16,724 --> 01:06:19,268
I told the wife, "You're young.

911
01:06:19,602 --> 01:06:21,312
"You can try next year."

912
01:06:24,899 --> 01:06:25,900
What happened?

913
01:06:25,983 --> 01:06:28,986
- I have to appraise the house.
- Okay, go.

914
01:06:29,153 --> 01:06:30,446
Hi.

915
01:06:30,780 --> 01:06:33,074
- I'll be back.
- We'll be here.

916
01:06:38,746 --> 01:06:39,955
Thanks.

917
01:06:42,917 --> 01:06:44,585
- Hi, Mrs. Lavasani.
- Hi, how are you?

918
01:06:44,752 --> 01:06:45,836
Good, you?

919
01:06:46,003 --> 01:06:49,298
- Sorry we're troubling you.
- No, what trouble?

920
01:06:49,465 --> 01:06:53,010
Is it true what they're saying?

921
01:06:53,177 --> 01:06:56,430
Yes, unfortunately he pushed her
and she fell and lost her baby.

922
01:06:57,139 --> 01:06:58,349
So what should I tell them?

923
01:06:58,933 --> 01:07:01,477
I don't know what they'll ask.

924
01:07:01,644 --> 01:07:04,689
What if he asks something
to his disadvantage?

925
01:07:06,273 --> 01:07:08,609
I think you should tell the truth.

926
01:07:08,693 --> 01:07:09,860
Please don't stand there.

927
01:07:10,486 --> 01:07:11,696
Where was he?

928
01:07:11,862 --> 01:07:13,864
Mr. Lavasani was in the kitchen.

929
01:07:14,031 --> 01:07:17,326
He didn't have a reaction
to your conversation?

930
01:07:17,493 --> 01:07:18,619
If he did I didn't notice.

931
01:07:19,203 --> 01:07:21,205
How did you realize she was pregnant?

932
01:07:22,289 --> 01:07:23,999
I think she told me.

933
01:07:24,625 --> 01:07:26,335
You asked. Why should I tell you?

934
01:07:28,295 --> 01:07:32,174
Her daughter was drawing
a man and a woman.

935
01:07:32,341 --> 01:07:33,781
She said this is my mommy and daddy.

936
01:07:34,176 --> 01:07:37,138
I said your mommy's not that fat.
She said she was pregnant.

937
01:07:37,304 --> 01:07:39,223
So it wasn't from her appearance?

938
01:07:39,390 --> 01:07:40,474
No.

939
01:07:40,683 --> 01:07:41,726
Why are you lying?

940
01:07:42,309 --> 01:07:43,477
You're a woman.

941
01:07:43,644 --> 01:07:47,022
You can't tell if a woman is pregnant?

942
01:07:47,231 --> 01:07:49,483
Even if I could tell,

943
01:07:49,650 --> 01:07:52,653
what difference does it make
for Mr. Lavasani?

944
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:55,489
This woman is his daughter's tutor.

945
01:07:55,656 --> 01:07:57,408
They've fixed their story.

946
01:07:57,658 --> 01:07:59,160
Why are you insulting this lady?

947
01:07:59,368 --> 01:08:00,995
No one's talking to you.

948
01:08:01,537 --> 01:08:03,417
When did I have the opportunity
to fix my story?

949
01:08:03,497 --> 01:08:04,707
I was here last night.

950
01:08:05,082 --> 01:08:08,002
One thing is clear. Now
that we are speaking,

951
01:08:08,335 --> 01:08:11,922
that man over there can hear us, can't he?

952
01:08:12,173 --> 01:08:13,507
I didn't hear you.

953
01:08:14,341 --> 01:08:18,345
My mind is on other things.

954
01:08:19,180 --> 01:08:22,266
Why would I listen to your conversation?

955
01:08:22,516 --> 01:08:23,934
Do I have to swear to God?

956
01:08:24,518 --> 01:08:25,770
Like you believe in God!

957
01:08:26,020 --> 01:08:27,855
No, God is for your type only!

958
01:08:28,230 --> 01:08:29,940
Open that window.

959
01:08:32,234 --> 01:08:33,778
He is an honorable man.

960
01:08:33,944 --> 01:08:36,363
I've been going there for a year
to teach his daughter.

961
01:08:37,531 --> 01:08:39,200
He's not like that.

962
01:08:39,533 --> 01:08:42,787
Why should she hide her pregnancy?

963
01:08:43,037 --> 01:08:45,873
If I knew I wouldn't have hired her.

964
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:49,418
Why did you hire her
without her husband's permission?

965
01:08:50,044 --> 01:08:51,045
Thank you.

966
01:08:51,378 --> 01:08:52,963
You may go.

967
01:08:53,130 --> 01:08:54,215
Thank you.

968
01:08:57,927 --> 01:09:03,724
"During the Sassanid period,
people were divided into two classes,

969
01:09:03,891 --> 01:09:06,227
"the royalty,

970
01:09:06,727 --> 01:09:10,481
"the upper class and the normal people."

971
01:09:10,648 --> 01:09:12,233
"The ordinary people."

972
01:09:16,987 --> 01:09:18,447
What did they ask you?

973
01:09:18,614 --> 01:09:22,493
Whether your dad knew she was pregnant.

974
01:09:22,660 --> 01:09:25,496
Forgive us for taking your time.

975
01:09:25,663 --> 01:09:28,958
There's nothing to forgive.

976
01:09:29,792 --> 01:09:32,086
Sweetie, how did mommy lose her baby?

977
01:09:32,253 --> 01:09:34,129
She got a tummy ache.

978
01:09:35,589 --> 01:09:37,424
Why?

979
01:09:38,092 --> 01:09:40,427
Did Daddy fight with her?

980
01:09:41,095 --> 01:09:43,639
Why should he fight with her?

981
01:09:43,806 --> 01:09:47,852
Maybe because she didn't tell him
she was working in people's homes?

982
01:09:48,018 --> 01:09:51,272
- Did he hit her?
- My mom and dad never fight.

983
01:09:51,939 --> 01:09:56,527
Then why were they fighting
in your drawing that day?

984
01:09:56,694 --> 01:09:58,153
You showed me.

985
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:00,155
They don't fight anymore.

986
01:10:00,322 --> 01:10:01,949
No?

987
01:10:02,783 --> 01:10:04,326
You're sure?

988
01:10:08,706 --> 01:10:11,542
Yesterday he said
he didn't know she was pregnant.

989
01:10:11,709 --> 01:10:13,961
Now he says he didn't push her.

990
01:10:14,128 --> 01:10:16,547
And you just stand there in silence!

991
01:10:16,839 --> 01:10:19,300
Honestly, didn't you push me?

992
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:21,468
- I didn't say I...
- Listen...

993
01:10:21,969 --> 01:10:23,846
Don't repeat everything.

994
01:10:24,805 --> 01:10:26,724
How far is the door from the stairs?

995
01:10:26,807 --> 01:10:27,933
2 meters?

996
01:10:28,017 --> 01:10:30,811
What else can have happened to her?

997
01:10:30,895 --> 01:10:32,229
The corridor in our house...

998
01:10:32,396 --> 01:10:33,856
- Look...
- I am talking!

999
01:10:34,064 --> 01:10:35,649
Don't talk. Just answer.

1000
01:10:35,858 --> 01:10:37,026
Quiet!

1001
01:10:37,818 --> 01:10:41,655
You've come here to answer.

1002
01:10:42,406 --> 01:10:44,325
I've a question for you to answer.

1003
01:10:44,491 --> 01:10:45,492
I want to ask him...

1004
01:10:45,701 --> 01:10:46,744
Ask me.

1005
01:10:46,827 --> 01:10:50,205
If you hadn't done anything wrong,
why'd you come to the hospital

1006
01:10:50,414 --> 01:10:52,333
to see what was wrong with her?

1007
01:10:52,499 --> 01:10:54,043
I came out of decency.

1008
01:10:54,251 --> 01:10:56,337
Where was your decency when you hit her?

1009
01:10:56,503 --> 01:10:58,172
Was anyone there during the fight?

1010
01:10:58,714 --> 01:11:00,007
Their neighbor was there.

1011
01:11:00,507 --> 01:11:01,717
I'll order questionings.

1012
01:11:01,884 --> 01:11:04,929
They're in it too just like the teacher.

1013
01:11:05,054 --> 01:11:07,222
He's been insulting me from the start!

1014
01:11:07,431 --> 01:11:09,183
Am I lying?

1015
01:11:09,350 --> 01:11:11,268
I'll determine who's lying or not.

1016
01:11:11,518 --> 01:11:12,770
You be quiet.

1017
01:11:12,937 --> 01:11:16,398
Sir, do you realize
his ex-wife has posted his bail?

1018
01:11:16,857 --> 01:11:17,858
Oh, my God!

1019
01:11:17,942 --> 01:11:19,401
Can someone vouch for you?

1020
01:11:19,610 --> 01:11:20,736
What do you mean?

1021
01:11:20,903 --> 01:11:23,864
A government employee
or business-owner to vouch for you.

1022
01:11:23,948 --> 01:11:25,783
- No one.
- Why vouch?

1023
01:11:26,033 --> 01:11:27,743
Because she's been accused.

1024
01:11:28,118 --> 01:11:29,203
Accused of what?

1025
01:11:29,620 --> 01:11:32,039
According to the complaint he filed...

1026
01:11:32,247 --> 01:11:33,374
Which he had no right...

1027
01:11:33,540 --> 01:11:36,961
She admitted that she tied his father
to the bed and locked him up.

1028
01:11:37,086 --> 01:11:38,128
I explained to you why.

1029
01:11:38,212 --> 01:11:39,588
Her child just died.

1030
01:11:39,755 --> 01:11:41,298
Keep your voice down.

1031
01:11:43,092 --> 01:11:45,803
Aren't you ashamed?
You call yourself a man?

1032
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:48,055
I said quiet.

1033
01:11:50,724 --> 01:11:54,895
For God's sake, listen to us for a change.

1034
01:11:55,062 --> 01:11:57,147
He is twisting everything.

1035
01:11:57,815 --> 01:12:00,651
He beat my wife and she had a miscarriage.

1036
01:12:00,901 --> 01:12:03,779
What could be clearer?
Why are you being unjust?

1037
01:12:03,946 --> 01:12:05,072
Listen to us for a change.

1038
01:12:05,239 --> 01:12:08,409
If you disturb the peace,
I'll send you to jail for three days.

1039
01:12:09,159 --> 01:12:11,578
I've lost everything.
You think I fear jail?

1040
01:12:11,745 --> 01:12:13,330
You should fear God.

1041
01:12:14,915 --> 01:12:17,334
Mr. Izadi, call an officer to arrest him.

1042
01:12:17,584 --> 01:12:19,628
Sir, for the sake of the Quran, don't.

1043
01:12:20,754 --> 01:12:23,424
- No, let them come and take me.
- Go out. Be quiet.

1044
01:12:23,590 --> 01:12:26,593
Why be quiet?
So they can trample my rights?

1045
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:27,928
Go out.

1046
01:12:28,345 --> 01:12:31,015
- Fine, I'm leaving.
- Sir, come out.

1047
01:12:32,641 --> 01:12:33,934
Let me get my helmet.

1048
01:12:34,101 --> 01:12:35,102
Get out.

1049
01:12:36,603 --> 01:12:39,273
I worked for ten years with a cobbler.

1050
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:42,860
They fired me and said
get justice if you can.

1051
01:12:43,027 --> 01:12:48,198
I sued and went back and forth for a year.
In the end, nothing.

1052
01:12:48,365 --> 01:12:50,117
They said go sit at home.

1053
01:12:51,118 --> 01:12:53,037
But this time I won't let it go.

1054
01:12:53,287 --> 01:12:55,873
This time it's different.

1055
01:12:56,123 --> 01:12:58,834
I have nothing to lose.

1056
01:12:59,001 --> 01:13:01,962
The problem is I can't talk like this guy.

1057
01:13:02,129 --> 01:13:03,797
I am hot-tempered.

1058
01:13:04,298 --> 01:13:05,507
Don't!

1059
01:13:14,641 --> 01:13:15,809
Hojjat?

1060
01:13:17,811 --> 01:13:19,021
I don't feel well.

1061
01:13:20,064 --> 01:13:21,315
Go sit there.

1062
01:13:21,398 --> 01:13:22,399
Let's go!

1063
01:13:22,483 --> 01:13:25,319
- What do you want? He's calm.
- I have to take him.

1064
01:13:25,486 --> 01:13:27,821
I'm going to talk to the judge.

1065
01:13:27,988 --> 01:13:30,032
Stay there and don't move.

1066
01:13:36,413 --> 01:13:37,998
Sir...

1067
01:13:38,165 --> 01:13:39,500
I beg you...

1068
01:13:39,666 --> 01:13:41,001
Please let me speak.

1069
01:13:41,502 --> 01:13:43,670
Sir, he's stressed out.

1070
01:13:43,837 --> 01:13:46,423
I've been patient for the past two days.

1071
01:13:46,590 --> 01:13:49,718
I swear, he's been
in and out of prison the past month.

1072
01:13:49,885 --> 01:13:52,012
His creditors put him in prison.

1073
01:13:52,096 --> 01:13:53,889
I begged them to let him come out.

1074
01:13:54,348 --> 01:13:56,433
I beg you to forgive him.

1075
01:13:56,934 --> 01:13:58,852
Sir, look.

1076
01:13:59,353 --> 01:14:00,521
Look at these.

1077
01:14:02,856 --> 01:14:06,193
Sir, can I ask you to please
forgive him this time?

1078
01:14:06,735 --> 01:14:08,779
Sir, every day he has to take these.

1079
01:14:08,946 --> 01:14:11,031
I swear I'm not lying.

1080
01:14:12,866 --> 01:14:16,578
Sir, since he was fired,
he's been depressed.

1081
01:14:16,745 --> 01:14:18,038
He can't help it.

1082
01:14:19,373 --> 01:14:20,707
Sir, you're his elder.

1083
01:14:20,874 --> 01:14:22,126
Please forgive him.

1084
01:14:24,461 --> 01:14:28,423
Go tell him to find
someone to vouch for you.

1085
01:14:28,715 --> 01:14:30,300
God bless you.

1086
01:14:31,051 --> 01:14:32,386
Don't leave the building.

1087
01:14:32,594 --> 01:14:34,763
No, I'll wait for him to come back.

1088
01:14:38,392 --> 01:14:39,810
Will you ask her?

1089
01:14:41,145 --> 01:14:44,398
She'll think it's 'cause she bailed me out.

1090
01:14:44,565 --> 01:14:46,233
So let her...

1091
01:14:47,901 --> 01:14:50,237
Dad... Please.

1092
01:14:52,990 --> 01:14:54,032
Okay.

1093
01:14:54,575 --> 01:14:55,826
Promise.

1094
01:14:59,746 --> 01:15:00,914
Why do you promise?

1095
01:15:06,837 --> 01:15:07,921
Dad...

1096
01:15:09,256 --> 01:15:10,257
Yes?

1097
01:15:12,676 --> 01:15:14,469
You didn't know Razieh was pregnant?

1098
01:15:16,763 --> 01:15:17,806
No.

1099
01:15:20,517 --> 01:15:21,643
Why?

1100
01:15:22,436 --> 01:15:23,478
Nothing.

1101
01:15:24,438 --> 01:15:25,647
So why did you ask?

1102
01:15:27,191 --> 01:15:28,609
Last night, Mom said you knew.

1103
01:15:29,860 --> 01:15:32,362
Where was she to see if I knew?

1104
01:15:33,155 --> 01:15:37,117
She said when you were told that
Razieh's baby had died,

1105
01:15:37,284 --> 01:15:38,869
you didn't say anything.

1106
01:15:39,036 --> 01:15:41,288
You didn't ask if she was pregnant.

1107
01:15:41,663 --> 01:15:43,457
You didn't get surprised.

1108
01:15:44,541 --> 01:15:48,670
At times like this, people usually ask
if she was carrying a child.

1109
01:15:48,837 --> 01:15:50,631
It was like you knew.

1110
01:15:54,718 --> 01:15:57,012
Your mom wants to turn you against me.

1111
01:16:13,862 --> 01:16:15,572
Will you ask her?

1112
01:17:14,381 --> 01:17:15,882
I can't.

1113
01:17:17,551 --> 01:17:18,760
Didn't you promise?

1114
01:17:21,596 --> 01:17:22,931
I'm sorry.

1115
01:17:33,317 --> 01:17:35,402
Which step was she on?

1116
01:17:36,278 --> 01:17:37,321
This one.

1117
01:17:37,404 --> 01:17:39,072
- This?
- This one.

1118
01:17:49,958 --> 01:17:52,502
Take Grandpa in. I'll be right back.

1119
01:18:26,912 --> 01:18:28,955
- Are you mad at me?
- No.

1120
01:18:33,502 --> 01:18:35,337
You went upstairs?

1121
01:18:35,879 --> 01:18:38,090
Yes, I went to see Mrs. Kalani.

1122
01:18:39,257 --> 01:18:40,425
What for?

1123
01:18:40,634 --> 01:18:43,887
I told her they are coming to investigate.
To beware.

1124
01:18:44,763 --> 01:18:46,056
Beware of what?

1125
01:18:48,850 --> 01:18:50,435
Beware of...

1126
01:18:51,353 --> 01:18:53,939
That they are coming to investigate.

1127
01:18:54,481 --> 01:18:56,024
Is that not okay?

1128
01:18:56,900 --> 01:19:00,404
If she is to tell the truth,
why should she beware?

1129
01:19:08,370 --> 01:19:10,580
- Termeh...
- Yes?

1130
01:19:10,664 --> 01:19:11,832
Come with me.

1131
01:19:11,998 --> 01:19:14,835
- I have homework.
- Leave it for now.

1132
01:19:16,044 --> 01:19:18,130
Look, imagine that I am her.

1133
01:19:22,551 --> 01:19:23,593
Is this right?

1134
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:28,390
When someone is thrown
they'll fall straight.

1135
01:19:28,557 --> 01:19:30,851
They don't hit here and bounce off

1136
01:19:31,059 --> 01:19:34,604
and hit here and then turn
and hit here and fall here.

1137
01:19:34,813 --> 01:19:35,897
Right?

1138
01:19:36,064 --> 01:19:38,650
If I'd thrown her from there,

1139
01:19:38,859 --> 01:19:41,403
she should've fallen there on those steps

1140
01:19:41,570 --> 01:19:44,865
or she would fall straight on the railing.

1141
01:19:45,073 --> 01:19:47,200
She wouldn't fall like this.

1142
01:19:47,451 --> 01:19:49,661
Imagine you were thrown.
Follow the direction.

1143
01:19:50,203 --> 01:19:52,956
- Then how had she fallen there?
- I don't know.

1144
01:19:53,165 --> 01:19:55,709
I'm just saying
she wasn't thrown on these steps.

1145
01:19:55,876 --> 01:19:57,377
Come and stand here.

1146
01:19:58,128 --> 01:20:00,922
- Why don't you tell them?
- Forget them.

1147
01:20:01,590 --> 01:20:03,758
I want you to know. Go on.

1148
01:20:18,690 --> 01:20:20,358
Did he throw you in this direction?

1149
01:20:20,525 --> 01:20:22,569
No, towards the lower level.

1150
01:20:22,736 --> 01:20:23,945
You look.

1151
01:20:24,112 --> 01:20:27,365
This door doesn't allow me to
even if I want to. It's not possible.

1152
01:20:27,532 --> 01:20:28,867
Where did you fall down?

1153
01:20:29,034 --> 01:20:31,328
- On these stairs.
- Which step?

1154
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:33,663
I think it was this one.

1155
01:20:33,872 --> 01:20:35,081
You think or you're sure?

1156
01:20:36,124 --> 01:20:37,542
I'm not sure.

1157
01:20:37,709 --> 01:20:39,544
Ma'am, this is where you found her?

1158
01:20:40,003 --> 01:20:41,838
I didn't see her fall.

1159
01:20:42,005 --> 01:20:44,466
When I got here, she was
on that lower step.

1160
01:20:44,633 --> 01:20:46,384
Why don't you say anything?

1161
01:20:46,593 --> 01:20:48,136
Go show them how he threw you.

1162
01:20:48,303 --> 01:20:50,597
I was so sick
I didn't know what happened to me.

1163
01:20:50,805 --> 01:20:53,558
Look, I'll stand in her place.

1164
01:20:53,725 --> 01:20:57,979
You in the doorway
and push me as hard as you want.

1165
01:20:58,146 --> 01:20:59,898
I'm saying it's not possible to fall there.

1166
01:21:00,065 --> 01:21:01,566
Of course you won't fall.

1167
01:21:02,317 --> 01:21:04,402
A pregnant woman falls easily.

1168
01:21:04,903 --> 01:21:07,531
Then you come here.
You choose who pushes you.

1169
01:21:07,697 --> 01:21:09,449
I'm saying it's not possible.

1170
01:21:09,616 --> 01:21:12,577
I'm saying if you push from here,
she won't fall on the stairs.

1171
01:21:13,036 --> 01:21:15,539
What stairs?
She says she fell on that step up there.

1172
01:21:15,789 --> 01:21:18,750
They all say they saw her on that one.

1173
01:21:18,959 --> 01:21:21,044
Ma'am, did you see her get thrown?

1174
01:21:21,294 --> 01:21:23,797
From up there I couldn't see the door,

1175
01:21:23,964 --> 01:21:25,966
but I saw the stairs when she fell.

1176
01:21:26,258 --> 01:21:28,593
Can you show me where you were?

1177
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:30,387
Maybe she got dizzy and fell.

1178
01:21:30,554 --> 01:21:32,889
How often did you use these stairs?

1179
01:21:33,056 --> 01:21:34,683
Why hadn't she gotten dizzy?

1180
01:21:35,016 --> 01:21:36,059
Excuse me.

1181
01:21:36,226 --> 01:21:39,563
That morning when I saw
her here I asked her

1182
01:21:39,980 --> 01:21:42,148
why there was garbage on the steps.

1183
01:21:42,315 --> 01:21:45,860
She said she had gotten dizzy
and dropped the bag.

1184
01:21:46,027 --> 01:21:47,070
Right?

1185
01:21:47,153 --> 01:21:51,157
- She took the garbage down.
- You told me you got dizzy.

1186
01:21:51,283 --> 01:21:54,619
Mrs. Kalani, hadn't she mopped
the stairs that day?

1187
01:21:54,786 --> 01:21:56,871
The stairs were wet. Maybe she slipped.

1188
01:21:57,289 --> 01:21:58,873
You jerk! You made her slip.

1189
01:21:59,082 --> 01:22:00,292
Be respectful!

1190
01:22:00,542 --> 01:22:02,252
I'm polite in front of your family.

1191
01:22:02,419 --> 01:22:04,462
You'd better be polite, you shit!

1192
01:22:05,255 --> 01:22:06,256
Don't cuss.

1193
01:22:06,339 --> 01:22:07,674
Take him outside.

1194
01:22:07,841 --> 01:22:10,552
Would his neighbors say anything
against him?

1195
01:22:11,511 --> 01:22:13,388
If you can prove they're lying...

1196
01:22:13,555 --> 01:22:16,099
So you think they're telling the truth?

1197
01:22:16,266 --> 01:22:19,019
To hell with me for wasting my time here.

1198
01:22:21,229 --> 01:22:22,230
Excuse me.

1199
01:22:22,314 --> 01:22:23,857
Give us her backpack.

1200
01:22:35,368 --> 01:22:36,661
Here it is...

1201
01:22:47,505 --> 01:22:49,799
Don't you want your drawing book?

1202
01:22:52,218 --> 01:22:54,262
Sweetie, don't be upset

1203
01:22:54,471 --> 01:22:57,140
that I am fighting with your mom and dad...

1204
01:22:57,349 --> 01:22:59,184
Let me put it in your bag.

1205
01:23:06,566 --> 01:23:09,069
My mommy didn't take your money.

1206
01:23:10,278 --> 01:23:11,529
I know.

1207
01:23:12,530 --> 01:23:15,200
That's not why I was fighting with her.

1208
01:23:17,077 --> 01:23:19,079
Then for what?

1209
01:23:20,038 --> 01:23:23,083
I was upset because she left my dad.

1210
01:23:25,835 --> 01:23:28,296
She went to the doctor's.

1211
01:23:33,551 --> 01:23:34,761
Go on.

1212
01:23:37,097 --> 01:23:38,098
Take care.

1213
01:23:38,431 --> 01:23:42,102
According to the court's request,
I'll examine him and write what I see.

1214
01:23:42,268 --> 01:23:46,022
Well, Doctor, you can see
he doesn't talk anymore.

1215
01:23:46,189 --> 01:23:47,982
Didn't you say he has Alzheimer's?

1216
01:23:48,149 --> 01:23:51,528
Yes, but before this happened,
he would speak a bit.

1217
01:23:51,695 --> 01:23:54,989
This is a doctor's office.
Prove that in court.

1218
01:23:55,281 --> 01:23:57,075
Does he have any bruising?

1219
01:23:57,617 --> 01:23:59,661
Yes, some.

1220
01:24:36,156 --> 01:24:37,490
What happened?

1221
01:24:38,533 --> 01:24:42,245
I'm not sure the bruising has to do
with when he fell off the bed.

1222
01:24:58,595 --> 01:25:00,138
Don't run.

1223
01:25:00,597 --> 01:25:03,224
Mom, pull the window down.
They're fighting.

1224
01:25:03,433 --> 01:25:05,685
Don't you see this is a girls' school?

1225
01:25:05,852 --> 01:25:08,062
I just have one question for this lady.

1226
01:25:08,229 --> 01:25:10,231
You're not allowed to stand here.

1227
01:25:14,527 --> 01:25:15,727
Take your fight to the police.

1228
01:25:15,779 --> 01:25:17,822
I don't want to fight.
I just want to speak to her.

1229
01:25:18,072 --> 01:25:21,951
I have nothing to say to you.
I don't know you or her husband.

1230
01:25:22,160 --> 01:25:24,662
- Then why did you lie in court?
- What lie?

1231
01:25:24,871 --> 01:25:25,955
She knows what lie.

1232
01:25:26,039 --> 01:25:27,207
Ms. Safaei, call the police.

1233
01:25:28,249 --> 01:25:30,335
Don't scare me with the police.

1234
01:25:30,418 --> 01:25:32,253
She's not involved.

1235
01:25:32,337 --> 01:25:35,131
Then why does she try to get
my daughter to speak?

1236
01:25:35,215 --> 01:25:36,216
I did no such thing.

1237
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:39,803
You are a teacher. Aren't you ashamed?

1238
01:25:39,969 --> 01:25:43,473
Why did you ask her if I hit her mom
and she lost the baby?

1239
01:25:43,556 --> 01:25:44,599
I never did.

1240
01:25:44,682 --> 01:25:46,893
You pick on a 4-year-old's drawing

1241
01:25:47,060 --> 01:25:50,188
and tell her her dad hit her mom
and she lost the baby?

1242
01:25:50,355 --> 01:25:51,481
I didn't say that!

1243
01:25:51,564 --> 01:25:55,735
Why do you think we beat our wives
and children like animals?

1244
01:25:55,902 --> 01:25:59,072
I swear on this Quran,
we're humans just like you.

1245
01:26:06,830 --> 01:26:09,165
I have nothing to lose.

1246
01:26:09,374 --> 01:26:13,044
Tell your husband
not to make me do something crazy.

1247
01:26:13,461 --> 01:26:15,421
I'll wait by the door.

1248
01:26:18,550 --> 01:26:19,926
I'm unemployed.

1249
01:26:20,093 --> 01:26:22,637
I'll stand out there all day.
Eventually you'll come out.

1250
01:26:22,804 --> 01:26:24,347
Come to the court and say you lied

1251
01:26:24,514 --> 01:26:27,559
or I'll get to the bottom of what's between
you and her husband.

1252
01:26:27,725 --> 01:26:30,687
Shame on you. I've been patient so far.

1253
01:26:30,854 --> 01:26:32,939
So why are you defending him?

1254
01:26:33,898 --> 01:26:35,275
I told the truth.

1255
01:26:35,441 --> 01:26:36,526
- The truth?
- Yes!

1256
01:26:36,609 --> 01:26:39,571
Place your hand on this and swear.

1257
01:26:39,779 --> 01:26:41,656
Why swear?
What does this have to do with her?

1258
01:26:41,823 --> 01:26:43,950
I'm not scared. What do I have to say?

1259
01:26:44,117 --> 01:26:47,579
You said her husband didn't know
my wife was pregnant.

1260
01:26:47,745 --> 01:26:48,746
- Yes.
- Swear it.

1261
01:26:49,289 --> 01:26:52,125
I swear on this Quran
that day at their house,

1262
01:26:52,333 --> 01:26:56,212
her husband was in the kitchen
and didn't hear what your wife and I said.

1263
01:26:57,338 --> 01:27:00,133
Okay? Anything else I should say?

1264
01:27:05,054 --> 01:27:06,306
He's crazy.

1265
01:27:09,559 --> 01:27:11,811
Call your husband. Don't go alone.

1266
01:27:12,103 --> 01:27:14,564
No, I don't want him to know. I'm sorry.

1267
01:27:14,731 --> 01:27:17,066
Why are you all standing here?

1268
01:27:18,610 --> 01:27:19,652
Hello?

1269
01:27:21,779 --> 01:27:23,531
Hello, Ms. Qahraei.

1270
01:27:23,948 --> 01:27:27,493
I had left you a message.

1271
01:27:27,660 --> 01:27:29,746
Can you please pick up?

1272
01:27:34,667 --> 01:27:38,338
The lady that took care of my dad,

1273
01:27:38,504 --> 01:27:42,467
apparently that day you gave her
the number for a gynecologist.

1274
01:27:42,634 --> 01:27:45,887
I wanted to ask you for that number to call

1275
01:27:46,054 --> 01:27:49,515
and see if she went
to see the doctor that week

1276
01:27:49,682 --> 01:27:51,976
and what her problem was.

1277
01:27:52,477 --> 01:27:55,229
I would appreciate you calling me back.
Thank you.

1278
01:28:10,995 --> 01:28:12,914
What do you want to do?

1279
01:28:14,415 --> 01:28:15,708
With what?

1280
01:28:17,001 --> 01:28:19,253
You want to keep this up?
Every day a new fight?

1281
01:28:19,796 --> 01:28:21,130
Why? What happened?

1282
01:28:21,381 --> 01:28:25,176
He went to her school today
and embarrassed her in front of everyone.

1283
01:28:27,845 --> 01:28:29,347
What did he say?

1284
01:28:29,764 --> 01:28:34,060
He screamed, "Her dad killed my child."

1285
01:28:36,437 --> 01:28:38,648
How can she go back to that school?

1286
01:28:39,565 --> 01:28:41,776
Do you know what you are doing?

1287
01:28:42,402 --> 01:28:43,653
What I am doing?

1288
01:28:47,782 --> 01:28:49,075
He's making threats.

1289
01:28:49,283 --> 01:28:50,618
He wouldn't dare!

1290
01:28:52,620 --> 01:28:54,288
Termeh, go to your room.

1291
01:29:00,712 --> 01:29:03,172
What if he kills your child
on her way to school?

1292
01:29:04,590 --> 01:29:06,092
What do you want me to do?

1293
01:29:06,300 --> 01:29:07,760
Run off abroad with you?

1294
01:29:07,969 --> 01:29:11,264
To hell with abroad.
Why can't you talk normally?

1295
01:29:11,431 --> 01:29:15,393
This is about Termeh
and the situation you've put her in.

1296
01:29:15,560 --> 01:29:17,186
I've put her in?

1297
01:29:17,770 --> 01:29:20,189
You have some nerve accusing me!

1298
01:29:20,356 --> 01:29:21,858
Who left home?

1299
01:29:22,275 --> 01:29:23,651
Who filed for a divorce?

1300
01:29:23,860 --> 01:29:25,180
You said leave whenever you want.

1301
01:29:25,236 --> 01:29:26,988
Why did you come back?

1302
01:29:27,196 --> 01:29:29,282
I didn't. I'm here because
of her situation.

1303
01:29:29,490 --> 01:29:30,533
Her situation's fine.

1304
01:29:30,616 --> 01:29:33,703
- You have two choices...
- Don't try to intimidate me.

1305
01:29:33,870 --> 01:29:35,121
What intimidation?

1306
01:29:36,122 --> 01:29:38,249
Either you clear up the situation...

1307
01:29:38,833 --> 01:29:40,633
- No, I know what to do.
- Didn't you hit her?

1308
01:29:40,752 --> 01:29:43,046
Didn't she fall? Didn't her baby die?

1309
01:29:43,254 --> 01:29:45,339
Yes! I killed her child.

1310
01:29:45,423 --> 01:29:48,468
Why are you so stubborn?
Pay the blood money and end it.

1311
01:29:48,551 --> 01:29:50,762
- I won't be forced into paying.
- Why forced?

1312
01:29:50,970 --> 01:29:52,180
Put yourself in their place.

1313
01:29:52,388 --> 01:29:55,349
- I'm not responsible for their troubles.
- Their child died!

1314
01:29:55,516 --> 01:29:59,896
And my dad has been hurt.
He doesn't even speak anymore.

1315
01:30:00,813 --> 01:30:02,732
He didn't speak much before.

1316
01:30:02,899 --> 01:30:05,610
I was happy with the few words he spoke.

1317
01:30:05,902 --> 01:30:07,528
Is it as bad as losing a baby?

1318
01:30:07,612 --> 01:30:10,114
Where were you to see I caused it?

1319
01:30:11,491 --> 01:30:14,118
- Then how did she lose it?
- I don't know.

1320
01:30:14,285 --> 01:30:18,247
There might be a chance that
her husband did something

1321
01:30:18,414 --> 01:30:21,167
and now she wants to blame me.

1322
01:30:21,334 --> 01:30:24,003
Her child said that day
she had gone to the doctor.

1323
01:30:24,170 --> 01:30:27,840
Why couldn't she wait two hours
to go to the doctor?

1324
01:30:28,007 --> 01:30:30,510
Why did she tie the old man
to his bed and leave?

1325
01:30:30,676 --> 01:30:32,845
The examiner said
her child died due to a blow.

1326
01:30:33,012 --> 01:30:36,057
How do we know it was a blow from me?

1327
01:30:36,599 --> 01:30:39,685
I won't accept it till
it's been proven to me.

1328
01:30:42,271 --> 01:30:44,565
Fine, let me take Termeh.

1329
01:30:44,732 --> 01:30:48,194
Shame on you
for putting pressure on me now.

1330
01:30:48,361 --> 01:30:49,487
I am worried about her.

1331
01:30:49,570 --> 01:30:52,615
Your child wants to live here.
She has to stay here and learn.

1332
01:30:52,824 --> 01:30:55,118
Learn what? Fighting and obstinacy?

1333
01:30:55,284 --> 01:30:57,662
To learn not to be a coward like you

1334
01:30:57,829 --> 01:31:00,373
who gives in so easily.

1335
01:31:00,665 --> 01:31:03,835
He knows who to frighten.
Why doesn't he threaten me?

1336
01:31:04,043 --> 01:31:05,044
Yes, I'm a coward.

1337
01:31:05,711 --> 01:31:09,090
Your whole life,

1338
01:31:09,257 --> 01:31:11,634
instead of solving problems,

1339
01:31:11,843 --> 01:31:16,556
you've either run away or
raised your hands and given in.

1340
01:31:16,806 --> 01:31:20,351
Just say why you want
to leave this country.

1341
01:31:20,518 --> 01:31:21,811
You're afraid to stay.

1342
01:31:22,395 --> 01:31:25,314
I was gone one week
and you couldn't manage.

1343
01:31:25,398 --> 01:31:27,400
I couldn't manage and I'm responsible.

1344
01:31:28,442 --> 01:31:31,946
Give me Termeh and you do what you want.

1345
01:31:34,824 --> 01:31:37,243
Termeh, sweetie, you don't have to stay.

1346
01:31:37,326 --> 01:31:39,036
Go wherever you like.

1347
01:31:44,542 --> 01:31:46,502
You still don't want to come?

1348
01:31:57,722 --> 01:31:59,432
"He sells it for 20 a kilo.

1349
01:31:59,599 --> 01:32:03,603
"If every day he sells
270 kilos..." Write 270.

1350
01:32:05,980 --> 01:32:10,026
Then, how much profit
does he make in one day?

1351
01:32:11,027 --> 01:32:12,737
How do you solve this?

1352
01:32:13,237 --> 01:32:14,947
Did you lie?

1353
01:32:16,699 --> 01:32:17,867
What?

1354
01:32:19,368 --> 01:32:20,494
Did you lie?

1355
01:32:22,121 --> 01:32:23,331
About what?

1356
01:32:25,166 --> 01:32:28,669
When you said
you didn't know she was pregnant.

1357
01:32:29,921 --> 01:32:31,130
Why?

1358
01:32:32,882 --> 01:32:37,803
You said that you didn't hear Ms. Qahraei
and Razieh speaking.

1359
01:32:37,887 --> 01:32:38,888
Yes.

1360
01:32:39,555 --> 01:32:44,268
Then how did you know that
Ms. Qahraei gave her the number?

1361
01:32:45,311 --> 01:32:47,772
Didn't she say it at the same time?

1362
01:32:56,113 --> 01:32:57,823
Okay.

1363
01:32:59,033 --> 01:33:01,994
If we want to calculate the profit...

1364
01:33:07,959 --> 01:33:09,043
Yes, I knew.

1365
01:33:11,587 --> 01:33:13,631
Your mom was telling the truth.

1366
01:33:15,967 --> 01:33:21,055
When they were talking in the hall,
I heard everything from the kitchen.

1367
01:33:22,390 --> 01:33:24,392
Then why did you say you didn't?

1368
01:33:27,937 --> 01:33:30,940
Do you know what would happen
if I said I knew?

1369
01:33:34,193 --> 01:33:36,862
One and a half to three years in prison.

1370
01:33:38,155 --> 01:33:41,826
I only thought of what would happen to you,

1371
01:33:42,326 --> 01:33:44,120
who you'd stay with.

1372
01:33:45,079 --> 01:33:46,914
I said I didn't know.

1373
01:33:49,750 --> 01:33:51,752
If you knew, why did you hit her?

1374
01:33:51,919 --> 01:33:55,673
I knew she was pregnant
but at that moment I didn't.

1375
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:58,718
I had forgotten it. I
wasn't paying attention.

1376
01:34:04,974 --> 01:34:06,934
So tell them this.

1377
01:34:10,771 --> 01:34:13,149
The law doesn't care about this.

1378
01:34:13,774 --> 01:34:16,235
Either I knew or I didn't...

1379
01:34:23,367 --> 01:34:24,660
Look at me.

1380
01:34:25,786 --> 01:34:28,414
If you want me to I'll tell them.

1381
01:35:21,926 --> 01:35:22,968
Hi.

1382
01:35:28,474 --> 01:35:31,018
Didn't I say not to come to the front?

1383
01:35:51,956 --> 01:35:53,207
Ms. Qahraei!

1384
01:36:04,927 --> 01:36:06,095
What are you doing?

1385
01:36:06,554 --> 01:36:09,014
Ms. Qahraei, wait...

1386
01:36:10,057 --> 01:36:13,853
If you pull over
I'll just explain something to you.

1387
01:36:14,311 --> 01:36:15,563
Please let me...

1388
01:36:17,022 --> 01:36:18,190
Dad!

1389
01:36:21,777 --> 01:36:23,537
Who's responsible for
my child's safety now?

1390
01:36:23,654 --> 01:36:25,322
Without a witness there's no case.

1391
01:36:25,489 --> 01:36:28,742
So without a witness
I should wait for him to kill her

1392
01:36:28,826 --> 01:36:30,286
and then come to you?

1393
01:36:30,494 --> 01:36:32,913
How should I know you
are telling the truth?

1394
01:36:33,080 --> 01:36:34,790
Why should I lie?

1395
01:36:34,999 --> 01:36:38,085
Bring my daughter and father here
just to lie?

1396
01:36:38,502 --> 01:36:40,546
- Is she here now?
- Yes, outside.

1397
01:36:40,629 --> 01:36:42,673
Ask her yourself.

1398
01:36:42,840 --> 01:36:47,261
I'm afraid to leave her at school.
I'm afraid to leave my dad at home.

1399
01:36:47,803 --> 01:36:49,388
Is the plaintiff here?

1400
01:36:50,723 --> 01:36:52,057
Did you finish writing?

1401
01:36:52,224 --> 01:36:53,309
Almost.

1402
01:36:54,268 --> 01:36:56,187
You didn't know his wife was pregnant?

1403
01:36:56,353 --> 01:36:57,605
No, I didn't.

1404
01:36:57,771 --> 01:37:01,275
When she was speaking to the tutor,
you didn't hear them?

1405
01:37:01,442 --> 01:37:02,526
No, I didn't.

1406
01:37:03,694 --> 01:37:05,070
You didn't, huh?

1407
01:37:05,779 --> 01:37:07,781
What I'm saying is...

1408
01:37:08,032 --> 01:37:10,451
The tutor came and revoked her testimony.

1409
01:37:11,076 --> 01:37:12,786
She says you knew.

1410
01:37:13,204 --> 01:37:15,664
- She said I knew?
- Yes, she came yesterday.

1411
01:37:15,831 --> 01:37:17,416
He threatened her...

1412
01:37:17,625 --> 01:37:19,752
Answer me. Did you hear her or not?

1413
01:37:19,919 --> 01:37:21,420
I said no.

1414
01:37:21,587 --> 01:37:23,631
How did you know
about the doctor's number?

1415
01:37:23,839 --> 01:37:25,049
My daughter told me.

1416
01:37:25,216 --> 01:37:26,467
What did she tell you?

1417
01:37:26,675 --> 01:37:28,844
That she got the number from her teacher.

1418
01:37:30,012 --> 01:37:31,889
Go tell her to come in.

1419
01:37:33,182 --> 01:37:34,517
Now?

1420
01:37:35,392 --> 01:37:36,852
And wait outside.

1421
01:37:37,853 --> 01:37:39,230
What question?

1422
01:37:43,943 --> 01:37:45,736
What does he want to ask?

1423
01:37:48,489 --> 01:37:50,616
I don't know. Give me that.

1424
01:37:58,332 --> 01:38:00,125
So what do you have to say?

1425
01:38:00,292 --> 01:38:02,002
You haven't asked me anything.

1426
01:38:02,795 --> 01:38:05,339
Didn't your dad tell you
what I want to ask you?

1427
01:38:05,631 --> 01:38:06,632
No.

1428
01:38:06,840 --> 01:38:08,133
What grade are you in school?

1429
01:38:08,634 --> 01:38:09,885
Sixth.

1430
01:38:10,052 --> 01:38:13,472
The day your tutor came to your house

1431
01:38:13,639 --> 01:38:16,475
and asked the lady about her pregnancy,

1432
01:38:17,059 --> 01:38:18,727
were you there?

1433
01:38:18,978 --> 01:38:22,690
Not then, I had gone to get my books.

1434
01:38:23,190 --> 01:38:27,653
Then how did you know she got the
doctor's number from your tutor?

1435
01:38:28,737 --> 01:38:32,408
She gave her the number later,
when she was leaving.

1436
01:38:32,575 --> 01:38:33,867
In front of you?

1437
01:38:34,368 --> 01:38:35,411
Yes.

1438
01:38:35,494 --> 01:38:36,996
Why didn't you tell your dad sooner?

1439
01:38:37,371 --> 01:38:38,372
What?

1440
01:38:38,664 --> 01:38:42,167
That she got the doctor's number
from your tutor.

1441
01:38:42,334 --> 01:38:45,337
I didn't think it was important
for my dad to know.

1442
01:38:47,840 --> 01:38:50,342
And did you tell your
dad or did he hear it?

1443
01:38:51,093 --> 01:38:54,888
That she gave the number? I told him.

1444
01:38:55,514 --> 01:38:57,516
- You told him?
- Yes.

1445
01:38:59,351 --> 01:39:00,519
Okay.

1446
01:39:51,737 --> 01:39:53,489
What crime did I commit?

1447
01:39:53,656 --> 01:39:54,740
Nothing. You're right.

1448
01:39:55,741 --> 01:39:57,660
He's not accepting his responsibility.

1449
01:39:57,826 --> 01:40:00,913
I admit that he's to blame,
but in the end what will happen?

1450
01:40:01,080 --> 01:40:05,626
One or two years in court
for a payment plan of the blood money.

1451
01:40:05,793 --> 01:40:08,087
But why? That's what upsets me.

1452
01:40:08,253 --> 01:40:10,172
Why do you think it's for the money?

1453
01:40:10,422 --> 01:40:11,674
When did I say such a thing?

1454
01:40:11,757 --> 01:40:16,345
You think I am a bum and my kid died
and I don't understand anything.

1455
01:40:16,512 --> 01:40:18,180
I never said anything like that.

1456
01:40:18,263 --> 01:40:19,932
Let's see what she's saying.

1457
01:40:20,474 --> 01:40:21,475
There's no other way.

1458
01:40:22,309 --> 01:40:24,436
Your child won't come back.

1459
01:40:24,603 --> 01:40:26,605
My husband won't get hanged.

1460
01:40:26,772 --> 01:40:29,149
Her husband didn't do it on purpose.

1461
01:40:29,775 --> 01:40:32,986
They're good people
for giving you a solution.

1462
01:40:33,153 --> 01:40:36,657
Take the money and settle it.
You can use it in your situation.

1463
01:40:36,949 --> 01:40:40,994
Right now we'll decide on an amount
and I'll get my husband's approval.

1464
01:40:42,788 --> 01:40:46,166
Now we have to get his approval?
For God's sake leave us alone.

1465
01:40:49,294 --> 01:40:51,463
You act like you don't need the money.

1466
01:40:51,630 --> 01:40:52,840
Take a look at yourself.

1467
01:40:53,006 --> 01:40:54,633
Don't let him go.

1468
01:40:58,804 --> 01:41:00,973
Wait a second. I want to talk to you.

1469
01:41:51,607 --> 01:41:52,941
Will you stay?

1470
01:41:55,694 --> 01:41:56,695
Mom...

1471
01:41:59,364 --> 01:42:01,366
Let me speak to him.

1472
01:42:11,043 --> 01:42:13,045
Come sit. I want to talk to you.

1473
01:42:15,589 --> 01:42:16,590
I can hear you.

1474
01:42:19,218 --> 01:42:22,471
I went and spoke to her husband today.

1475
01:42:23,222 --> 01:42:24,556
Sit down.

1476
01:42:35,400 --> 01:42:36,777
I managed

1477
01:42:36,985 --> 01:42:38,779
to get him to agree

1478
01:42:39,738 --> 01:42:42,241
to take 15 million instead of 40 million.

1479
01:42:42,407 --> 01:42:45,494
Three five-million checks
in exchange for his consent.

1480
01:42:45,911 --> 01:42:47,579
How dare you speak to him about money?

1481
01:42:48,497 --> 01:42:50,377
I can't handle the stress
of my child's safety.

1482
01:42:50,415 --> 01:42:51,959
You don't get it.

1483
01:42:52,125 --> 01:42:54,962
Just now when you were late,
I was worried sick.

1484
01:42:55,170 --> 01:42:57,756
Why are you interfering?

1485
01:42:58,757 --> 01:43:00,425
I didn't come here to fight.

1486
01:43:00,759 --> 01:43:02,761
Oh, God, why can't I make her understand?

1487
01:43:02,928 --> 01:43:06,515
Didn't you say it was my fault,
that I introduced her,

1488
01:43:06,765 --> 01:43:09,768
that if I hadn't left,
none of this would've happened?

1489
01:43:09,935 --> 01:43:11,436
So let me fix it, then.

1490
01:43:11,937 --> 01:43:15,107
If I pay, it means
I have accepted it was my fault.

1491
01:43:15,315 --> 01:43:16,358
But he has consented.

1492
01:43:16,441 --> 01:43:17,860
He won't let us be.

1493
01:43:18,110 --> 01:43:20,696
- He won't, anyway.
- Why should I bribe him?

1494
01:43:20,863 --> 01:43:22,447
Think of it as my dower money.

1495
01:43:23,115 --> 01:43:26,493
If I had to I would beg and borrow

1496
01:43:26,869 --> 01:43:28,662
to get your dower money.

1497
01:43:28,871 --> 01:43:31,623
But I don't have the money
to pay for extortion.

1498
01:43:31,832 --> 01:43:35,460
Our child is going through adolescence.
She is suffering.

1499
01:43:37,129 --> 01:43:41,884
So you understand
the sensitivity of her adolescence.

1500
01:43:42,217 --> 01:43:44,017
If she was suffering
she wouldn't have stayed.

1501
01:43:44,553 --> 01:43:46,471
Why do you think she stayed?

1502
01:43:47,222 --> 01:43:48,807
Did she choose you?

1503
01:43:50,642 --> 01:43:52,561
To keep us from separating.

1504
01:43:54,813 --> 01:43:56,565
She knows I won't go anywhere without her.

1505
01:43:59,192 --> 01:44:01,987
She is suffering but she doesn't show it.

1506
01:44:06,408 --> 01:44:08,994
Call them now and say I won't pay

1507
01:44:09,161 --> 01:44:11,997
until it's been proved to me
that I am responsible.

1508
01:44:12,164 --> 01:44:13,749
I'll sell my car.

1509
01:44:14,875 --> 01:44:16,501
Don't sell it for my sake.

1510
01:44:16,668 --> 01:44:18,086
It's not for you.

1511
01:44:18,253 --> 01:44:20,505
If your child is not worth...

1512
01:44:20,672 --> 01:44:23,675
Why are you talking nonsense?
Money's not the issue.

1513
01:44:23,884 --> 01:44:27,095
I won't rest till my child's safety
is guaranteed.

1514
01:44:27,512 --> 01:44:29,932
You don't have the right to do anything.

1515
01:44:30,098 --> 01:44:31,350
Understand?

1516
01:44:32,017 --> 01:44:34,770
If I had done nothing
you would be in prison.

1517
01:44:38,899 --> 01:44:41,443
Come to court and get back the bail.

1518
01:44:42,027 --> 01:44:44,279
I don't want to be out because of it.

1519
01:45:03,090 --> 01:45:04,257
Get up, Termeh.

1520
01:45:05,384 --> 01:45:06,551
Get up, let's go.

1521
01:45:06,718 --> 01:45:08,053
Get up, I tell you.

1522
01:45:08,220 --> 01:45:09,388
Mom, please.

1523
01:45:11,974 --> 01:45:13,600
I don't want you to stay here.

1524
01:45:13,976 --> 01:45:15,143
No, Mom, I won't let you.

1525
01:45:15,310 --> 01:45:19,147
Is 15 million more important
than your child's life?

1526
01:45:19,314 --> 01:45:20,732
I won't let you do this.

1527
01:45:20,899 --> 01:45:22,734
If your child is not important...

1528
01:45:22,901 --> 01:45:25,612
Mom, please listen, why are you doing this?

1529
01:45:25,779 --> 01:45:27,114
You said you would stay.

1530
01:45:27,280 --> 01:45:28,407
I was stupid!

1531
01:45:30,409 --> 01:45:32,035
Mom, please...

1532
01:45:32,119 --> 01:45:33,453
I'll wait in the car.

1533
01:45:44,631 --> 01:45:48,593
Go there for a few days
till your exams are finished.

1534
01:45:49,302 --> 01:45:50,971
Your grandparents are there.

1535
01:45:51,847 --> 01:45:53,473
You'll have more fun.

1536
01:45:53,765 --> 01:45:55,517
Didn't you say it's not serious?

1537
01:45:56,643 --> 01:45:58,145
It got serious.

1538
01:45:59,771 --> 01:46:00,939
Termeh...

1539
01:46:01,857 --> 01:46:02,941
Honey...

1540
01:46:05,027 --> 01:46:06,862
If you cry I'll cry, too.

1541
01:46:07,029 --> 01:46:09,448
Why won't you pay them
so she'll come back?

1542
01:46:10,032 --> 01:46:12,451
This has nothing to do
with her coming back.

1543
01:46:12,617 --> 01:46:14,995
It does. She had come to stay.

1544
01:46:15,203 --> 01:46:17,622
Her stuff was in the car, I saw it.

1545
01:46:58,080 --> 01:47:01,333
If you think I am guilty, go get your mom.

1546
01:47:01,500 --> 01:47:04,002
We'll call them and go pay them.

1547
01:48:20,912 --> 01:48:22,289
I have doubts.

1548
01:48:22,455 --> 01:48:24,040
Didn't he throw you?

1549
01:48:24,791 --> 01:48:25,792
Yes.

1550
01:48:26,918 --> 01:48:28,920
Did something happen at home?

1551
01:48:30,422 --> 01:48:32,424
No. Even before, my child wasn't moving.

1552
01:48:34,092 --> 01:48:35,635
Before he threw you?

1553
01:48:41,766 --> 01:48:43,977
You mean your child had already died?

1554
01:48:44,811 --> 01:48:47,147
I don't know. Maybe.

1555
01:48:47,314 --> 01:48:48,940
Had something happened?

1556
01:48:51,276 --> 01:48:54,946
I'm not sure, but the
night before, I had pain.

1557
01:48:56,489 --> 01:48:58,950
- Have you ever lost a baby before?
- No.

1558
01:49:02,287 --> 01:49:03,663
I was hit by a car.

1559
01:49:10,962 --> 01:49:14,466
Your father-in-law had
gone into the street.

1560
01:49:14,633 --> 01:49:16,009
I went after him.

1561
01:49:17,302 --> 01:49:19,763
He was crossing the street to come back.

1562
01:49:19,930 --> 01:49:23,975
I ran to stop him but I got hit instead.

1563
01:49:24,684 --> 01:49:26,645
The pain started that night.

1564
01:49:29,856 --> 01:49:31,191
Does your husband know this?

1565
01:49:33,652 --> 01:49:35,612
Why don't you come say this in court?

1566
01:49:38,281 --> 01:49:42,118
My husband will kill me
if he finds out I told you this.

1567
01:49:43,662 --> 01:49:46,831
Since yesterday
when he promised his creditors,

1568
01:49:46,998 --> 01:49:48,166
he's been waiting.

1569
01:49:49,501 --> 01:49:53,046
What do we have to do with all this?

1570
01:49:56,299 --> 01:49:57,884
It's my fault.

1571
01:50:01,972 --> 01:50:05,850
Yesterday when he said
you'd promised him this money,

1572
01:50:06,017 --> 01:50:08,520
I got really scared. I called a few people.

1573
01:50:09,145 --> 01:50:11,856
They say if I have doubts
then it's a sin to take it.

1574
01:50:13,358 --> 01:50:16,194
If we don't pay
my husband's innocence must be proved.

1575
01:50:16,695 --> 01:50:20,198
I made you swear not to repeat any of this!

1576
01:50:20,365 --> 01:50:22,492
But your husband won't leave us alone.

1577
01:50:23,034 --> 01:50:24,411
I fear for my child.

1578
01:50:24,577 --> 01:50:29,165
I'm afraid that if I take this money,
something will happen to my child.

1579
01:50:29,332 --> 01:50:31,042
What do you want me to do?

1580
01:50:32,544 --> 01:50:34,170
Don't pay this money.

1581
01:50:35,588 --> 01:50:36,589
Don't.

1582
01:50:44,389 --> 01:50:46,558
Will your husband leave us alone?

1583
01:51:19,799 --> 01:51:22,552
Give me that. Bring some plates.

1584
01:51:23,595 --> 01:51:25,930
Don't worry. Nothing will happen.

1585
01:51:47,077 --> 01:51:50,080
When you revoke your complaint,

1586
01:51:50,288 --> 01:51:53,416
we'll give you these three checks.

1587
01:51:53,583 --> 01:51:54,918
God bless you.

1588
01:51:55,001 --> 01:51:59,923
Hojjat, get a pen and paper so we can
write everything down and sign it.

1589
01:52:01,132 --> 01:52:02,467
I want to say something first...

1590
01:52:02,634 --> 01:52:04,469
Say a prayer and finish it.

1591
01:52:04,636 --> 01:52:07,806
I have already agreed
and will honor my word.

1592
01:52:07,972 --> 01:52:13,269
I just want his wife
and my daughter to be here when I speak.

1593
01:52:15,814 --> 01:52:17,107
Where is she?

1594
01:52:19,526 --> 01:52:20,860
Thank you.

1595
01:52:21,778 --> 01:52:23,321
Please, also call my daughter.

1596
01:52:27,659 --> 01:52:29,786
Come in. Your father wants you.

1597
01:52:39,838 --> 01:52:41,673
Termeh, come and sit here.

1598
01:52:42,006 --> 01:52:43,675
Excuse me, sir.

1599
01:52:54,686 --> 01:52:56,187
Look...

1600
01:52:56,354 --> 01:52:59,566
I wrote the checks and
I'll give them to you.

1601
01:53:00,150 --> 01:53:01,484
There's no problem.

1602
01:53:01,901 --> 01:53:03,194
I need to ask a favor.

1603
01:53:04,571 --> 01:53:07,031
Ma'am, you are a devout person.

1604
01:53:08,199 --> 01:53:11,703
Swear on the Quran
that I caused your miscarriage.

1605
01:53:20,837 --> 01:53:21,838
Bring a Quran.

1606
01:53:22,881 --> 01:53:24,340
Go get it.

1607
01:53:41,608 --> 01:53:44,360
Come quickly or they'll suspect something.

1608
01:53:45,778 --> 01:53:48,114
His creditors are here for the money.

1609
01:53:48,281 --> 01:53:50,283
You'll ruin our reputation.

1610
01:53:52,410 --> 01:53:54,287
I won't swear.

1611
01:53:55,788 --> 01:53:59,751
Didn't you say you went to get his father
and a car hit you?

1612
01:54:01,419 --> 01:54:03,087
Why aren't you coming?

1613
01:54:04,214 --> 01:54:05,924
She's afraid to swear.

1614
01:54:07,133 --> 01:54:08,259
Why?

1615
01:54:08,426 --> 01:54:12,055
I... I have doubts.

1616
01:54:18,061 --> 01:54:19,270
Oh, God...

1617
01:54:20,939 --> 01:54:22,732
Azam, go sit with them.

1618
01:54:26,444 --> 01:54:30,323
Why are you saying this now?

1619
01:54:30,949 --> 01:54:33,284
I swear I told Azam.

1620
01:54:34,619 --> 01:54:37,163
Tell me exactly what happened.

1621
01:54:40,291 --> 01:54:43,127
The day before, a car hit me.

1622
01:54:43,753 --> 01:54:46,422
And that night I had a lot of pain.

1623
01:54:56,307 --> 01:54:58,810
- Let's go, it'll be my sin.
- No.

1624
01:54:59,435 --> 01:55:00,853
It's a sin. I asked.

1625
01:55:01,020 --> 01:55:03,982
What sin? He's consented. Let's go.

1626
01:55:04,148 --> 01:55:07,110
I am scared we'll be punished.

1627
01:55:07,277 --> 01:55:10,488
More punished than this?
Look at my situation.

1628
01:55:10,655 --> 01:55:14,200
Have mercy on me. On our child.

1629
01:55:14,367 --> 01:55:17,954
I'm afraid of something happening
to our child.

1630
01:55:18,371 --> 01:55:19,622
Let's go.

1631
01:55:19,789 --> 01:55:20,873
I can't.

1632
01:55:21,040 --> 01:55:22,333
Let's go.

1633
01:55:25,169 --> 01:55:26,796
I can't.

1634
01:55:31,175 --> 01:55:33,344
Don't hit yourself!

1635
01:55:52,822 --> 01:55:56,701
Why did you come here tonight?
Didn't I tell you not to come?

1636
01:55:57,493 --> 01:55:59,704
Didn't I say we don't want your money?

1637
01:56:00,163 --> 01:56:02,540
How will I live in this house?

1638
01:56:03,708 --> 01:56:06,210
Why did you do this to me?

1639
01:57:33,631 --> 01:57:34,674
Come on.

1640
01:57:39,971 --> 01:57:41,472
Let's go.

1641
01:57:57,530 --> 01:57:58,990
Hello. Come in.

1642
01:58:09,041 --> 01:58:10,835
So what's your decision?

1643
01:58:11,502 --> 01:58:16,799
Your parents have left it up to you
to decide who you want to live with.

1644
01:58:16,966 --> 01:58:19,510
With your father or your mother?

1645
01:58:21,012 --> 01:58:22,388
Have you decided?

1646
01:58:22,513 --> 01:58:23,556
Yes.

1647
01:58:24,140 --> 01:58:25,850
- Have you?
- Yes.

1648
01:58:36,694 --> 01:58:38,362
Have you decided or not?

1649
01:58:38,529 --> 01:58:39,530
Yes.

1650
01:58:42,033 --> 01:58:43,659
And what is it?

1651
01:58:45,495 --> 01:58:47,330
Do I have to say it now?

1652
01:58:48,539 --> 01:58:51,375
- If you haven't decided...
- Yes, I have.

1653
01:58:55,922 --> 01:58:58,466
- If you haven't decided yet...
- I have.

1654
01:58:58,549 --> 01:58:59,550
And?

1655
01:59:00,885 --> 01:59:03,721
Would you prefer them to wait outside?

1656
01:59:05,056 --> 01:59:06,516
Can they?

1657
01:59:07,558 --> 01:59:09,685
Sir, wait outside for a minute.

1658
01:59:11,854 --> 01:59:12,855
You, too, ma'am.
