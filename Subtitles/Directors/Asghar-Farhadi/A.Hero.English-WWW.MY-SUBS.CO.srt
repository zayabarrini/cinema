1
00:01:18,452 --> 00:01:22,202
IN THE NAME OF GOD

2
00:01:29,202 --> 00:01:30,577
Rahim Soltani.

3
00:01:36,035 --> 00:01:37,119
Hello.

4
00:05:03,411 --> 00:05:09,369
A Hero

5
00:05:14,619 --> 00:05:19,536
Rahim! What are you doing here?
I could have come down.

6
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:24,369
I wonder how 2,500 years ago,
they climbed up here to visit their dead.

7
00:05:24,452 --> 00:05:26,619
They smoked less than you!

8
00:05:26,703 --> 00:05:27,744
Hello.

9
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,910
-Great to see you.
-How are you?

10
00:05:29,994 --> 00:05:32,202
-Why didn't you warn us?
-It wasn't planned.

11
00:05:33,494 --> 00:05:35,619
-All good?
-Yes. Let's go down.

12
00:05:35,744 --> 00:05:39,244
-More stairs?
-You're breathless!

13
00:05:39,369 --> 00:05:42,619
How come you're still so plump
with all these stairs?

14
00:05:42,744 --> 00:05:44,244
Your sister's fault.

15
00:05:44,369 --> 00:05:45,703
How's Malih?

16
00:05:45,827 --> 00:05:48,452
The usual, neck pain, arthritis.

17
00:05:48,536 --> 00:05:49,785
Hi, Mehdi.

18
00:05:49,868 --> 00:05:52,119
Hi, Rahim. Congratulations!

19
00:05:52,202 --> 00:05:54,119
-Are you done?
-No, just some leave.

20
00:05:54,202 --> 00:05:55,369
Enjoy.

21
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:59,285
-How long are you here for?
-Two days.

22
00:05:59,369 --> 00:06:00,327
Is that all?

23
00:06:00,411 --> 00:06:03,035
I had to beg them for it. Hello.

24
00:06:03,119 --> 00:06:04,868
Is it you, Rahim?

25
00:06:05,035 --> 00:06:06,661
You're very welcome.

26
00:06:06,744 --> 00:06:09,785
-Is the sugar there?
-I had tea before coming.

27
00:06:09,868 --> 00:06:11,285
Come on...

28
00:06:11,369 --> 00:06:15,536
How dare you compare prison tea
to that served on the tomb of Xerxes?

29
00:06:15,619 --> 00:06:19,619
You should save up your leave
and stay longer.

30
00:06:19,703 --> 00:06:22,910
I'm more looking for a way
not to go back there.

31
00:06:24,952 --> 00:06:29,411
-What way?
-Let's go and talk to Bahram.

32
00:06:29,494 --> 00:06:33,494
If talking had made a difference,
he wouldn't have sent you to jail.

33
00:06:33,577 --> 00:06:35,077
What an idea!

34
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:39,035
-I can have 75 million tomans.
-How?

35
00:06:42,119 --> 00:06:43,744
Someone will give it to me.

36
00:06:44,827 --> 00:06:45,994
With interest?

37
00:06:46,785 --> 00:06:48,494
No, it's not a loan.

38
00:06:48,577 --> 00:06:52,661
Whenever you get it, we'll
go to him and he'll have to shut up.

39
00:06:52,744 --> 00:06:54,619
If we make promises we can't keep...

40
00:06:54,703 --> 00:06:56,119
I'll have it this afternoon.

41
00:06:56,202 --> 00:06:57,619
-For sure?
-For sure.

42
00:06:59,202 --> 00:07:00,619
Then call him.

43
00:07:01,285 --> 00:07:02,952
He doesn't answer my calls.

44
00:07:03,035 --> 00:07:05,994
Get the money, we'll go this afternoon.

45
00:07:06,119 --> 00:07:07,577
Is your car here?

46
00:07:51,785 --> 00:07:53,327
Look at her chador.

47
00:07:54,327 --> 00:07:55,494
My darling!

48
00:07:56,868 --> 00:07:59,077
-Hello, my love.
-Hello, darling.

49
00:07:59,577 --> 00:08:04,285
Let's move from here, it's too busy.
What a beard!

50
00:08:04,369 --> 00:08:07,285
-You like it?
-I love it! Keep it.

51
00:08:10,327 --> 00:08:14,577
The wait since last night was almost
harder than for the last two months.

52
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:17,285
I've never seen you with a chador.

53
00:08:17,827 --> 00:08:20,035
I had to hide the bag under it.

54
00:08:20,619 --> 00:08:21,910
Let me see.

55
00:08:24,703 --> 00:08:26,285
Put it back in.

56
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,785
I didn't expect to long for you so badly.

57
00:08:32,703 --> 00:08:34,827
I missed you a lot too.

58
00:08:37,994 --> 00:08:42,744
Thirteen, fourteen, fifteen,
sixteen, seventeen.

59
00:08:45,369 --> 00:08:48,994
Seventeen times 4.3 million.

60
00:08:49,077 --> 00:08:50,536
Has it gone down?

61
00:08:50,661 --> 00:08:53,494
-When did you ask the price?
-Last week.

62
00:08:54,077 --> 00:08:56,994
Gold rate changes every hour.

63
00:08:58,077 --> 00:09:01,452
-Can it go up again tomorrow?
-Anything is possible.

64
00:09:02,327 --> 00:09:03,661
Damn!

65
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,077
So? Are you selling them?

66
00:09:12,494 --> 00:09:15,369
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

67
00:09:15,452 --> 00:09:17,910
So why are you upset?

68
00:09:17,994 --> 00:09:19,952
We should make sure first.

69
00:09:20,035 --> 00:09:22,577
-About what?
-That he gives his consent.

70
00:09:22,661 --> 00:09:24,494
Why wouldn't he?

71
00:09:24,577 --> 00:09:27,785
He might want all his money back
to let me out.

72
00:09:31,244 --> 00:09:34,119
Keep them, so I don't take them back home.

73
00:09:34,202 --> 00:09:35,785
Put them in my bag.

74
00:09:39,661 --> 00:09:41,411
Under my laundry.

75
00:09:41,494 --> 00:09:43,077
Give it to me.

76
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,785
Leave it in the bag.

77
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:49,285
With two days' leave,
don't spend half the day washing.

78
00:09:49,369 --> 00:09:51,077
I'll do it.

79
00:09:59,994 --> 00:10:01,369
Who's there?

80
00:10:05,452 --> 00:10:06,619
Hello, uncle!

81
00:10:06,703 --> 00:10:09,119
Hello, my unwashed beauty!

82
00:10:09,202 --> 00:10:11,952
Look at his beard!

83
00:10:14,703 --> 00:10:16,619
-Who's at home?
-Mom.

84
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:19,369
-Mom! Uncle's here!
-Without warning!

85
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,369
You've got as heavy as your brother.

86
00:10:21,452 --> 00:10:24,411
-Mom! Uncle's here!
-He's very welcome!

87
00:10:24,494 --> 00:10:27,077
-Hello, Malih!
-Hello, my darling.

88
00:10:27,202 --> 00:10:29,703
-How are you?
-I'm glad you're here.

89
00:10:29,785 --> 00:10:32,077
-I knew it was you.
-How come?

90
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,202
Because of the way you ring.

91
00:10:34,285 --> 00:10:38,827
-Everything okay? What are you doing?
-Come over.

92
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:41,577
Your mom's opening a tomato sauce shop.

93
00:10:41,661 --> 00:10:45,160
Come here, the unexpected visitor!

94
00:10:45,285 --> 00:10:47,035
So good to see you.

95
00:10:48,661 --> 00:10:50,369
You've got a lot thinner.

96
00:10:50,494 --> 00:10:52,452
You tell me that every time.

97
00:10:53,494 --> 00:10:55,868
-How's Siavash?
-He's at school.

98
00:10:58,244 --> 00:11:00,285
Can I have a towel to take a shower?

99
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,994
They called Mom from his school today.

100
00:11:08,119 --> 00:11:10,661
-Why?
-For nothing.

101
00:11:10,744 --> 00:11:13,785
-Want a razor?
-No. What has he done now?

102
00:11:13,868 --> 00:11:16,285
He got into a fight yesterday.

103
00:11:16,369 --> 00:11:18,994
Already telling tales?

104
00:11:19,077 --> 00:11:22,411
But why don't they call his mother?

105
00:11:22,494 --> 00:11:26,077
They probably did
and she said they should call you.

106
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,035
Go to the school tomorrow, if you can.

107
00:11:30,035 --> 00:11:32,703
What's up? He was getting better.

108
00:11:37,994 --> 00:11:41,703
-Uncle... Uncle...
-Yes?

109
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:43,536
His mother is remarrying.

110
00:11:45,868 --> 00:11:48,868
-Who said that?
-Siavash did.

111
00:11:48,952 --> 00:11:51,452
He said someone has proposed to her.

112
00:12:00,411 --> 00:12:02,369
The towel is behind the door.

113
00:12:02,494 --> 00:12:05,494
Call me if you want me to shave your neck.

114
00:12:23,035 --> 00:12:24,910
-Hello.
-Hello.

115
00:12:26,827 --> 00:12:27,910
Hello.

116
00:12:29,119 --> 00:12:30,327
Isn't your dad here?

117
00:12:31,411 --> 00:12:33,160
He was. He went out.

118
00:12:38,035 --> 00:12:39,202
Here you are.

119
00:12:39,327 --> 00:12:40,994
Thank you. How much is it?

120
00:12:41,077 --> 00:12:42,327
52,000 tomans.

121
00:12:42,452 --> 00:12:43,868
He told me he'd be here.

122
00:12:43,994 --> 00:12:45,411
He's not here now.

123
00:12:45,536 --> 00:12:47,369
-Here you are.
-Thank you.

124
00:12:47,494 --> 00:12:49,285
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

125
00:12:49,411 --> 00:12:51,785
Can you please call him
to see when he comes?

126
00:13:06,868 --> 00:13:09,494
Hello? Hi, Dad. Where are you?

127
00:13:11,494 --> 00:13:16,285
Hossein's here. He wants to see you.
Rahim's brother-in-law.

128
00:13:16,744 --> 00:13:17,910
Okay then.

129
00:13:18,035 --> 00:13:19,994
-Can I talk to him?
-Hold on.

130
00:13:21,452 --> 00:13:22,994
Thank you.

131
00:13:23,577 --> 00:13:26,910
Hi, Bahram. How are you?

132
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:30,202
Nothing serious, I hope.

133
00:13:32,035 --> 00:13:37,910
I'd have preferred to see you to finally
sort this out after three years.

134
00:13:40,994 --> 00:13:45,369
He's put together part of his debt.
Around 70 million tomans.

135
00:13:46,619 --> 00:13:49,952
We've had many meetings.
I've heard many promises.

136
00:13:50,035 --> 00:13:51,827
This jerk is lying.

137
00:13:52,536 --> 00:13:55,327
I'm promising the 70 million tomans.

138
00:13:56,285 --> 00:13:58,536
His friends have arranged it for him.

139
00:13:58,661 --> 00:14:00,577
His friends and family

140
00:14:00,661 --> 00:14:04,994
should give me checks to pay off his debt
and I'll withdraw the case.

141
00:14:05,077 --> 00:14:09,077
If he gets out, he'll work hard
to pay off the rest bit by bit.

142
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:12,494
You, his relatives,
wouldn't write checks for him.

143
00:14:12,577 --> 00:14:15,411
Why do you expect me to trust him?

144
00:14:15,494 --> 00:14:18,285
I can hardly pay my own rent.

145
00:14:18,369 --> 00:14:22,160
Otherwise, I wouldn't have let him
spend one night in jail.

146
00:14:22,285 --> 00:14:25,910
You're saying he'll work if he gets out.
Give me a bond check...

147
00:14:25,994 --> 00:14:28,160
Do him a favor and let him out.

148
00:14:28,244 --> 00:14:31,411
He let down his family.
He deserves no favor.

149
00:14:31,494 --> 00:14:33,077
Forget about what he deserves.

150
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:36,160
Don't you want your money?
Half of it is ready, cash.

151
00:14:36,244 --> 00:14:39,536
-I don't trust him.
-It's not about trust.

152
00:14:39,619 --> 00:14:44,411
I was fooled once
by his hangdog look, that's enough.

153
00:14:45,952 --> 00:14:50,494
Listen, Bahram,
let's meet and talk about it.

154
00:14:50,619 --> 00:14:54,411
Wait a minute, let me talk to him.
Just a moment.

155
00:14:55,202 --> 00:14:56,244
Excuse me.

156
00:14:59,411 --> 00:15:00,494
Rahim?

157
00:15:00,619 --> 00:15:04,703
I wish I could pay him back
and not be so humiliated.

158
00:15:04,785 --> 00:15:08,202
If I give him bond checks
for the rest of your debt,

159
00:15:08,327 --> 00:15:11,703
could you manage to pay him
7.5 million tomans a month?

160
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:13,244
If I get out, I'll work.

161
00:15:13,369 --> 00:15:15,327
-What work?
-Anything.

162
00:15:16,619 --> 00:15:19,369
I'll take your word and commit to it.

163
00:15:19,452 --> 00:15:21,661
I can't stand going back to prison.

164
00:15:29,577 --> 00:15:30,536
Hello?

165
00:15:30,619 --> 00:15:33,910
Come and eat before it gets cold.
Come on, Siavash.

166
00:15:33,994 --> 00:15:35,703
Negar, turn off the tablet.

167
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:41,369
Thanks a lot. Where's Hossein?

168
00:15:41,452 --> 00:15:46,077
In the bathroom. As soon as
we sit down to eat, he has to go.

169
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,077
Okay, kids, come on.

170
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,868
Siavash, turn off the tablet.
Come on, Negar.

171
00:15:51,952 --> 00:15:53,452
Pass me the glasses.

172
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:56,244
Get up, son. Let's have dinner.

173
00:15:56,327 --> 00:15:57,703
I'm not hungry.

174
00:15:57,827 --> 00:16:00,327
Come on. You'll play later.

175
00:16:00,411 --> 00:16:02,703
Negar, come on.

176
00:16:02,785 --> 00:16:04,868
-Where shall I sit?
-Next to me.

177
00:16:04,952 --> 00:16:07,744
The phone's ringing.
Hossein, aren't you coming?

178
00:16:07,827 --> 00:16:11,910
Hossein, see who's been calling you.

179
00:16:13,452 --> 00:16:16,910
Siavash, turn down the tablet.
It gives me a headache.

180
00:16:16,994 --> 00:16:20,202
Mom's rice crust looks yummy.

181
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:25,202
Hello? Yes, please? Hello, how are you?

182
00:16:25,994 --> 00:16:29,661
Thank you. Sorry, I was outside.

183
00:16:31,244 --> 00:16:34,536
Yes, please. I'm listening.

184
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:38,744
-I'm not hungry.
-Your dad's come after two months.

185
00:16:38,827 --> 00:16:42,202
Siavash, come on.
There'll be no rice crust left.

186
00:16:42,285 --> 00:16:45,285
But I... don't want.

187
00:16:45,411 --> 00:16:46,744
Too bad for you!

188
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,244
Uncle, put some for me in the dish.

189
00:16:51,952 --> 00:16:53,868
-Can I stir it?
-Sure.

190
00:16:53,952 --> 00:16:55,494
Where are you going, Nima?

191
00:16:55,619 --> 00:16:58,077
Too bad for both of them!

192
00:16:58,202 --> 00:17:00,077
Leave me alone!

193
00:17:00,202 --> 00:17:02,119
-Stop it, Nima!
-Siavash!

194
00:17:02,202 --> 00:17:04,160
-Nima!
-I don't want.

195
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:09,827
-Don't worry, he'll come.
-How rude!

196
00:17:11,035 --> 00:17:14,744
Yum-yum! Thank you so much.

197
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:17,661
-Who's calling at dinner time?
-Bahram.

198
00:17:17,785 --> 00:17:18,744
Mummy.

199
00:17:20,577 --> 00:17:21,952
What did he say?

200
00:17:22,035 --> 00:17:24,703
He wants the checks
and the money tomorrow.

201
00:17:25,452 --> 00:17:26,744
Pass me the bread.

202
00:17:27,827 --> 00:17:29,160
What did you tell him?

203
00:17:29,744 --> 00:17:31,661
Let's have dinner first.

204
00:17:31,785 --> 00:17:33,160
My turn, Mom.

205
00:17:36,744 --> 00:17:39,077
Who's the friend giving you 70 million?

206
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,827
Have some rice crust, Uncle.

207
00:17:41,952 --> 00:17:43,536
Someone you don't know.

208
00:17:43,619 --> 00:17:46,119
Please don't go to a loan shark again.

209
00:17:50,035 --> 00:17:52,035
Who mentioned loan sharks?

210
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,411
Then where is this money coming from?

211
00:17:54,494 --> 00:17:56,827
I told you, a friend promised it.

212
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,536
Don't take me for an idiot.

213
00:18:00,244 --> 00:18:01,827
It's not a loan.

214
00:18:05,952 --> 00:18:07,619
Did you agree to meet?

215
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:14,327
I told him I only had two checks left.
I'll order a new checkbook tomorrow.

216
00:18:14,411 --> 00:18:16,827
-How long will that take?
-What?

217
00:18:17,744 --> 00:18:20,077
That. The new checkbook.

218
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,619
Wait for your friend
to give you the 70 million.

219
00:18:22,703 --> 00:18:25,744
Between what people say
and what they do...

220
00:18:30,077 --> 00:18:34,077
You shouldn't have promised then,
so as not to embarrass me.

221
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,285
I don't have enough checks.

222
00:18:36,369 --> 00:18:39,411
Even if he had them
and gave him bond checks,

223
00:18:39,494 --> 00:18:41,994
how will you pay him back every month?

224
00:18:43,452 --> 00:18:45,452
Siavash, turn it down.

225
00:18:49,868 --> 00:18:54,202
Hossein offered to write the checks,
Malih. I didn't force him.

226
00:18:54,285 --> 00:18:56,536
I'm not saying you shouldn't give checks.

227
00:18:56,619 --> 00:19:00,035
You should find a job first
and then give checks to him.

228
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:04,285
If ever one of the checks bounces,
it will be the same hassle.

229
00:19:04,369 --> 00:19:07,452
His leave ends in two days.
How can he find a job?

230
00:19:08,077 --> 00:19:10,703
I don't know. It's up to you.

231
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,952
Swear on Mom's soul
you're telling me the truth.

232
00:19:48,577 --> 00:19:50,160
Whose handbag is it?

233
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,827
You rummaged in my bag?

234
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:55,077
I wanted to take your laundry.

235
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:59,785
Don't do anything that would disgrace
you and the family forever.

236
00:19:59,868 --> 00:20:01,452
Like what?

237
00:20:01,577 --> 00:20:03,577
Where did you get these coins?

238
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:05,744
A friend gave them to me.

239
00:20:05,827 --> 00:20:10,661
The cigarettes, the lighter, the handbag
are also your friend's?

240
00:20:11,494 --> 00:20:15,369
Go on, Malih. Call me a thief.

241
00:20:15,452 --> 00:20:18,327
What's this handbag with a broken strap?

242
00:20:25,744 --> 00:20:28,952
He... is... shouting.

243
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:34,619
That was a bit rough, wasn't it?
Let's make it smoother.

244
00:20:35,452 --> 00:20:40,577
The boy... is... shouting.

245
00:20:41,202 --> 00:20:43,868
-Good.
-Bye.

246
00:20:43,952 --> 00:20:48,744
The girl... is washing... her... hands.

247
00:20:50,244 --> 00:20:53,994
Shall we try a bit smoother?
How would that sound?

248
00:20:54,077 --> 00:20:56,494
Was... sitting.

249
00:20:57,327 --> 00:20:58,910
Good morning. Yes, please?

250
00:20:58,994 --> 00:21:01,994
Is there anyone else
who can write the bond checks?

251
00:21:02,077 --> 00:21:05,160
Who would take the risk?

252
00:21:05,244 --> 00:21:07,536
What are you going to do?

253
00:21:08,077 --> 00:21:12,536
I don't feel up to it.

254
00:21:13,077 --> 00:21:14,452
What do you mean?

255
00:21:15,035 --> 00:21:18,244
-My conscience won't allow it.
-You're saying that now?

256
00:21:18,327 --> 00:21:20,494
Ever since you told me, I've had doubts.

257
00:21:24,035 --> 00:21:26,952
I thought that all that praying to God

258
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:29,827
made Him have pity on us
and provide a miracle.

259
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:33,952
Then instead of 17 coins, He'd have
sent us everything to clear my debt

260
00:21:34,035 --> 00:21:35,785
and got me out of this mess.

261
00:21:40,035 --> 00:21:41,244
Why are you upset?

262
00:21:41,327 --> 00:21:42,994
-I'm not upset.
-Yes, you are.

263
00:21:44,619 --> 00:21:45,910
What's wrong?

264
00:21:47,285 --> 00:21:50,744
Farkhondeh, tell me. My love.

265
00:21:51,452 --> 00:21:54,285
-Nothing.
-I'm sorry, I can't cope with this.

266
00:21:55,327 --> 00:21:57,119
Okay. Go and find the owner.

267
00:21:59,452 --> 00:22:01,703
-We have to go together.
-Goodbye.

268
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:12,160
No. 55, please refer to Box 7.

269
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:16,035
-Excuse me...
-Take a number and wait your turn.

270
00:22:16,119 --> 00:22:18,868
-It's not for a banking process.
-Go ahead.

271
00:22:19,494 --> 00:22:21,285
-Hello.
-Hello.

272
00:22:21,703 --> 00:22:25,035
I was wondering
if anybody came here for a lost bag.

273
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:26,369
No, why?

274
00:22:28,202 --> 00:22:30,244
I've found some gold.

275
00:22:33,077 --> 00:22:36,494
Guys, did anyone report something missing?

276
00:22:38,452 --> 00:22:41,411
-How much is it?
-A lot.

277
00:22:41,494 --> 00:22:44,327
-Just outside the bank?
-No, at the bus stop.

278
00:22:45,035 --> 00:22:46,910
-When?
-Recently.

279
00:22:47,744 --> 00:22:49,577
Nobody's come to ask.

280
00:22:49,661 --> 00:22:53,035
If anybody does, I have the handbag.

281
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:55,244
Well done. Give us your number.

282
00:22:55,327 --> 00:22:59,119
Can I have some paper to write it down?

283
00:23:01,994 --> 00:23:02,952
Here you are.

284
00:23:03,035 --> 00:23:04,577
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

285
00:23:04,661 --> 00:23:07,452
No. 60, please refer to Box 7.

286
00:23:12,452 --> 00:23:15,994
They can call this number and ask for me.

287
00:23:16,077 --> 00:23:18,619
-What's this number?
-A prison.

288
00:23:18,703 --> 00:23:20,119
You work there?

289
00:23:20,244 --> 00:23:23,536
I'm an inmate, for a debt.
I'm out on leave.

290
00:23:25,452 --> 00:23:28,494
If you like, write an ad with your number.

291
00:23:28,577 --> 00:23:31,244
I'll copy it
and you can put it around here.

292
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:32,744
Thanks a lot.

293
00:23:46,536 --> 00:23:48,369
We're rid of it.

294
00:23:54,202 --> 00:23:55,285
What's the matter?

295
00:23:56,452 --> 00:23:59,244
-Are you regretting it?
-No.

296
00:23:59,327 --> 00:24:01,661
Please stop sulking.

297
00:24:03,077 --> 00:24:06,077
If you're regretting it,
just cross the street,

298
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:10,119
take my number, call me,
and say it's your bag.

299
00:24:10,202 --> 00:24:14,868
Describe it. If it's right,
we'll meet in some discreet place,

300
00:24:14,994 --> 00:24:16,452
and I'll return it to you.

301
00:24:17,244 --> 00:24:21,369
But if you're sulking when you call me,
I won't give it back to you.

302
00:24:21,994 --> 00:24:23,411
You must be cheerful.

303
00:24:26,285 --> 00:24:30,494
Just put yourself in the shoes
of this poor woman who's lost it.

304
00:24:32,244 --> 00:24:34,452
-Can you?
-Okay.

305
00:24:34,536 --> 00:24:37,827
Hello, madam.
Have you lost a bag? I've found it.

306
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:39,494
God bless you.

307
00:24:39,577 --> 00:24:43,494
Is that it? I want a reward.

308
00:24:46,327 --> 00:24:48,119
You have such a pure heart.

309
00:24:53,369 --> 00:24:56,411
Tomorrow, I'll be back in jail
and longing for you.

310
00:24:56,494 --> 00:24:58,160
This poor heart!

311
00:24:59,202 --> 00:25:01,327
And you want me to quit smoking.

312
00:25:05,035 --> 00:25:06,577
Let's go somewhere calmer.

313
00:25:07,868 --> 00:25:11,661
-Is it for my reward?
-Get going.

314
00:25:13,411 --> 00:25:18,536
I barely saw you these two days.
Let me at least say goodbye properly.

315
00:25:19,577 --> 00:25:21,994
-What's this?
-Your clothes.

316
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:26,577
I got you a new shirt.

317
00:25:26,661 --> 00:25:29,744
Thank you so much. It's very nice.

318
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:32,868
And there's a new toothbrush.

319
00:26:07,327 --> 00:26:09,868
-Good job.
-Thank you.

320
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:14,703
-Mr. Soltani?
-Yes, Madam?

321
00:26:16,119 --> 00:26:18,202
Did you give our number to anyone?

322
00:26:18,327 --> 00:26:21,285
I'm sorry, Ms. Marvasti. I had to.

323
00:26:21,369 --> 00:26:24,119
I shouldn't have given you this number.

324
00:26:24,244 --> 00:26:25,285
The thing is...

325
00:26:25,369 --> 00:26:29,619
I found a bag and I gave the number
in case the owner is found,

326
00:26:29,703 --> 00:26:31,536
so that she can get it back.

327
00:26:31,619 --> 00:26:34,452
-Did anyone call you?
-She'll call again.

328
00:26:34,536 --> 00:26:36,952
Don't give this number out to anyone.

329
00:26:37,035 --> 00:26:38,494
I won't. I'm sorry.

330
00:26:40,703 --> 00:26:45,910
I've just come back from leave,
I won't get another one any time soon.

331
00:26:45,994 --> 00:26:49,703
Can someone at your place
give it to her? She's so anxious.

332
00:26:49,785 --> 00:26:52,244
I'll call to see if my sister's there.

333
00:26:52,327 --> 00:26:55,452
Excuse me.
Can you please describe the bag?

334
00:26:55,536 --> 00:26:59,202
Then I can arrange for you
to get it back at my sister's.

335
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,785
You're very welcome.

336
00:27:02,661 --> 00:27:06,411
Where did you lose it? How long ago?

337
00:27:08,577 --> 00:27:10,160
What did it look like?

338
00:27:15,577 --> 00:27:17,160
How many coins?

339
00:27:19,536 --> 00:27:21,119
What brand of cigarettes?

340
00:27:24,077 --> 00:27:26,619
-Who's there?
-Open the door, please.

341
00:27:28,868 --> 00:27:32,160
-Is this Mr. Soltani's house?
-Yes.

342
00:27:32,244 --> 00:27:33,577
Come in.

343
00:27:33,661 --> 00:27:35,160
Excuse me.

344
00:27:36,285 --> 00:27:39,827
-Hello.
-Hello. Was it you I just spoke to?

345
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:40,994
Yes, come in.

346
00:27:41,077 --> 00:27:45,077
I still had my bag on my shoulder
at the bus stop.

347
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,994
I took out money for my ticket.

348
00:27:48,744 --> 00:27:51,744
When the bus arrived, I hopped on.

349
00:27:51,827 --> 00:27:54,827
I don't know if it fell off
as I was getting on

350
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:57,327
or if it got ripped off on the bus.

351
00:27:57,452 --> 00:28:01,202
At the next stop,
I realized I didn't have it.

352
00:28:01,327 --> 00:28:05,160
I shouted to the driver
I'd lost my bag and to stop.

353
00:28:05,285 --> 00:28:07,035
The poor guy stopped.

354
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:11,411
He shut the bus doors
and searched all the passengers.

355
00:28:11,494 --> 00:28:17,119
He said it wasn't there,
that I probably dropped it somewhere.

356
00:28:17,411 --> 00:28:19,994
Why did you put so many coins in it?

357
00:28:20,119 --> 00:28:22,494
I was going to sell them.

358
00:28:23,202 --> 00:28:27,327
Each time I left the house,
I was so afraid

359
00:28:27,411 --> 00:28:31,411
my husband or his brother
would find the gold

360
00:28:31,494 --> 00:28:33,868
and it'd go up in a puff of smoke.

361
00:28:34,452 --> 00:28:39,077
I decided to sell them and put the money
in a bank account,

362
00:28:39,827 --> 00:28:43,244
so that nobody around me
would know I had gold.

363
00:28:44,244 --> 00:28:47,994
Siavash dear, go get the bag
your dad told us about.

364
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:57,119
This morning, I came across the ad
that said a bag was found.

365
00:28:57,785 --> 00:28:59,494
As if God...

366
00:29:00,994 --> 00:29:02,619
You are blessed.

367
00:29:05,035 --> 00:29:08,160
God knows I earned these coins one by one,

368
00:29:08,244 --> 00:29:11,910
weaving rugs, struggling,

369
00:29:12,744 --> 00:29:17,494
saving them secretly
in case I'm in need someday.

370
00:29:17,577 --> 00:29:20,494
It was God's will
my brother had some leave

371
00:29:20,619 --> 00:29:22,244
and found your bag on his way.

372
00:29:22,785 --> 00:29:25,744
-Have some tea, please.
-Thank you so much.

373
00:29:26,369 --> 00:29:30,369
I was so nervous I took a taxi,
he's waiting outside.

374
00:29:30,744 --> 00:29:35,285
Siavash, did you find it?
I put it near the mirror.

375
00:29:35,369 --> 00:29:39,703
May God arrange a way
for your brother to get out of jail.

376
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:42,536
Such a good man shouldn't be there.

377
00:29:48,077 --> 00:29:49,952
-Here you are.
-Look...

378
00:29:50,452 --> 00:29:53,244
The strap's broken.
It must have fallen off.

379
00:29:54,994 --> 00:29:57,577
Check if you have everything in it.

380
00:29:57,661 --> 00:30:00,119
Pass my best regards to your brother.

381
00:30:00,244 --> 00:30:02,369
-Sorry I bothered you.
-Not at all.

382
00:30:02,452 --> 00:30:03,952
-Take care.
-Thank you.

383
00:30:04,077 --> 00:30:06,160
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

384
00:30:09,703 --> 00:30:10,868
Hey, kid.

385
00:30:13,744 --> 00:30:17,744
-Here, son. Take it, please.
-No...

386
00:30:17,827 --> 00:30:19,619
Don't offer it, please. Thanks.

387
00:30:19,703 --> 00:30:22,910
It comes from the bottom
of my heart. Take it.

388
00:30:23,661 --> 00:30:24,994
Dad...

389
00:30:27,536 --> 00:30:29,703
He says his father wouldn't like it.

390
00:30:29,785 --> 00:30:32,285
It's yours. Don't tell your dad.

391
00:30:32,411 --> 00:30:34,244
Go on, darling, no problem.

392
00:30:34,327 --> 00:30:37,369
-Bye.
-That's very kind of you. Goodbye.

393
00:30:40,119 --> 00:30:41,411
Let's go.

394
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:56,619
Write your sister's number down.
Mr. Taheri wants to talk to her.

395
00:30:58,119 --> 00:30:59,494
-To my sister?
-Yes.

396
00:31:00,411 --> 00:31:01,494
What for?

397
00:31:01,577 --> 00:31:04,661
About the gold.
He wants to ask her a few questions.

398
00:31:28,244 --> 00:31:29,536
Here you are.

399
00:31:39,703 --> 00:31:42,411
-Hello.
-Hello. Well done.

400
00:31:49,452 --> 00:31:52,868
-Would you like some tea?
-Yes, thanks.

401
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:54,452
He's in jail for a debt.

402
00:31:55,744 --> 00:31:57,661
I've just talked to his sister.

403
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:05,494
Yes, he found it during his leave.

404
00:32:06,369 --> 00:32:10,703
You come whenever you want. He's here.

405
00:32:11,244 --> 00:32:14,994
You can also talk to him outside.
We can arrange it.

406
00:32:15,077 --> 00:32:17,411
What you did is beautiful.

407
00:32:17,494 --> 00:32:19,285
It's a noble gesture.

408
00:32:19,411 --> 00:32:22,703
-Please take a seat.
-Please sit down.

409
00:32:22,785 --> 00:32:24,411
Okay, let me know.

410
00:32:24,494 --> 00:32:28,202
-He hasn't told anybody.
-That's what makes it beautiful.

411
00:32:28,785 --> 00:32:31,244
-How's everything?
-Fine, thank you.

412
00:32:31,327 --> 00:32:33,160
Okay. Goodbye.

413
00:32:33,244 --> 00:32:37,077
-Well?
-They'll organize it and call back.

414
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:41,327
A TV crew is coming to interview you.

415
00:32:41,411 --> 00:32:45,910
I did nothing special.
It was just a few coins...

416
00:32:45,994 --> 00:32:47,703
The number doesn't matter.

417
00:32:47,785 --> 00:32:51,952
You've taken your two days' leave
to find the owner, in your situation.

418
00:32:52,035 --> 00:32:57,202
There's also a newspaper
that wants to arrange an interview.

419
00:32:57,994 --> 00:33:00,910
-It's very kind of you.
-No, it's kind of you.

420
00:33:00,994 --> 00:33:03,327
We have to learn from you.

421
00:33:03,411 --> 00:33:05,452
Come on. It's getting late.

422
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:06,868
They'll be here soon.

423
00:33:06,952 --> 00:33:08,119
Let him have his tea.

424
00:33:08,202 --> 00:33:10,661
Make a congratulatory banner and hang it.

425
00:33:10,744 --> 00:33:13,661
He's our calligrapher.
He can't congratulate himself.

426
00:33:13,744 --> 00:33:16,119
We'll have them done outside.

427
00:33:16,202 --> 00:33:18,536
-I did nothing special.
-Yes, you did.

428
00:33:18,619 --> 00:33:21,035
A screw-up like that doesn't go unnoticed.

429
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:24,452
Letting loads of gold get away
is special! Get going.

430
00:33:24,577 --> 00:33:27,369
-Stop pulling his leg.
-"Nothing special."

431
00:33:30,452 --> 00:33:31,577
Soltani!

432
00:33:32,536 --> 00:33:35,994
Come here.
Have you got something decent to wear?

433
00:33:36,077 --> 00:33:38,452
-Shall I order it for you?
-Yes, I do.

434
00:33:38,536 --> 00:33:43,035
Go and tidy yourself up,
and trim your beard. What's that?

435
00:33:50,327 --> 00:33:52,202
-Hello.
-Hello.

436
00:33:56,619 --> 00:33:57,744
Mr. Taheri?

437
00:33:59,369 --> 00:34:00,577
Mr. Taheri.

438
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,285
-Yes?
-Excuse me, just one second.

439
00:34:08,411 --> 00:34:11,160
It's just that... I didn't find the bag.

440
00:34:11,868 --> 00:34:13,035
Who did then?

441
00:34:13,661 --> 00:34:16,077
Well... My wife.

442
00:34:16,868 --> 00:34:18,369
Who returned it to the owner?

443
00:34:18,452 --> 00:34:21,160
I made the decision to return it.

444
00:34:21,285 --> 00:34:24,619
So you gave it back.
Tell them exactly that.

445
00:34:24,703 --> 00:34:26,994
Say, "My wife found it and I returned it."

446
00:34:27,077 --> 00:34:31,577
No, in fact, nobody knows we're together.

447
00:34:31,661 --> 00:34:33,785
I can't give her name.

448
00:34:34,910 --> 00:34:37,411
-Isn't she your wife?
-Not yet.

449
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:41,285
So you're naughty too!

450
00:34:41,369 --> 00:34:44,536
No... We're getting married
as soon as I get out.

451
00:34:44,619 --> 00:34:47,327
-Anyway, you returned the gold, right?
-Yes.

452
00:34:47,452 --> 00:34:51,452
There we go.
Forget about the rest and hurry up.

453
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:19,703
Rolling.

454
00:35:19,827 --> 00:35:25,160
He is very conscientious, very earnest,

455
00:35:25,244 --> 00:35:27,494
very reliable, and a very honest man.

456
00:35:27,577 --> 00:35:32,744
In spite of his financial difficulties,
he has proven with this act

457
00:35:32,827 --> 00:35:37,202
that one can always prioritize

458
00:35:37,285 --> 00:35:39,952
good deeds over personal interest.

459
00:35:41,452 --> 00:35:46,202
I have been sentenced to 10 years
while I have nothing to pay my debts.

460
00:35:46,744 --> 00:35:49,744
I'm Rahim Soltani, Mostafa's son.

461
00:35:49,827 --> 00:35:53,744
I was born
in Sangsiah neighborhood in Shiraz.

462
00:35:57,077 --> 00:36:00,661
Rahim! You're on TV!

463
00:36:00,744 --> 00:36:02,035
-Really?
-Yes!

464
00:36:05,369 --> 00:36:08,910
I was a sign painter and calligrapher.

465
00:36:08,994 --> 00:36:12,536
When printed banners came along,
I had to close my business.

466
00:36:12,661 --> 00:36:13,994
Why are you in jail?

467
00:36:15,577 --> 00:36:21,411
I got a loan to start a new business.

468
00:36:21,494 --> 00:36:25,703
But my partner took my money,

469
00:36:25,785 --> 00:36:29,202
so I wasn't able to pay back the loan.

470
00:36:29,285 --> 00:36:32,285
My guarantor had to pay for me,

471
00:36:32,369 --> 00:36:37,494
but then, he filed a complaint
against me and I went to jail.

472
00:36:37,577 --> 00:36:40,868
At first, I thought it was a miracle.

473
00:36:40,952 --> 00:36:43,369
God put this bag in my path

474
00:36:43,452 --> 00:36:47,661
to free me from the harassment
and the insults of my creditor.

475
00:36:47,785 --> 00:36:53,577
I even sent him a message to tell him
I could pay part of my debt back.

476
00:36:53,661 --> 00:36:59,619
But then I thought to myself I couldn't.
It was probably a test.

477
00:36:59,744 --> 00:37:03,661
I got off the bus here.
I went there to buy cakes,

478
00:37:03,744 --> 00:37:06,452
so I wouldn't go home empty-handed.

479
00:37:06,536 --> 00:37:10,160
I saw a handbag that had fallen here.
At this point.

480
00:37:11,494 --> 00:37:15,160
Right here.
On the ground, with the strap broken.

481
00:37:15,244 --> 00:37:17,994
I opened it, it was full of coins.

482
00:37:18,077 --> 00:37:20,994
I looked around, there was nobody.

483
00:37:21,077 --> 00:37:25,994
I thought it over all night.
I thought if I took another's belonging,

484
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:29,577
at some point,
I'll be punished for it a hundredfold.

485
00:37:29,661 --> 00:37:31,744
Next morning, I came back here

486
00:37:31,827 --> 00:37:35,411
and put ads everywhere
saying I'd found a bag.

487
00:37:35,494 --> 00:37:37,119
First, I went to that bank.

488
00:37:37,244 --> 00:37:40,994
I asked them if anybody
had been there for a lost bag.

489
00:37:41,077 --> 00:37:42,411
They said no.

490
00:37:42,494 --> 00:37:48,077
That's why I had to write the ad
with my phone number.

491
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,994
Here, in the prison,
we really appreciate him.

492
00:37:51,077 --> 00:37:53,744
Since we've had him with us,

493
00:37:53,827 --> 00:37:58,494
our spaces, the climate
have all become more colorful.

494
00:37:58,577 --> 00:38:03,536
He has regularly taken part
in all the training courses

495
00:38:03,619 --> 00:38:09,202
and cultural activities
organized for the inmates.

496
00:38:09,619 --> 00:38:12,327
Thank God, it has borne fruit.

497
00:38:12,785 --> 00:38:16,994
I wish to thank the warden, Mr. Salehpour,

498
00:38:17,077 --> 00:38:20,536
and Mr. Taheri,
in charge of cultural activities,

499
00:38:20,661 --> 00:38:24,244
for their efforts to improve
the inmates' wellbeing.

500
00:38:24,327 --> 00:38:28,411
How did I look? Okay? Really?

501
00:38:29,703 --> 00:38:31,160
Did everyone at home see it?

502
00:38:32,369 --> 00:38:34,494
-Well done.
-Thanks.

503
00:38:34,577 --> 00:38:38,661
Do you realize the whole country
saw the shirt you gave me?

504
00:38:40,703 --> 00:38:42,661
You know how to fool people.

505
00:38:46,327 --> 00:38:48,411
Farkhondeh, it's ringing.

506
00:38:51,244 --> 00:38:52,703
I'll call you.

507
00:38:54,577 --> 00:38:57,910
Take care of yourself. Me too, a lot.

508
00:38:58,952 --> 00:38:59,994
Bye.

509
00:39:08,661 --> 00:39:09,827
What did you say?

510
00:39:16,994 --> 00:39:19,119
-I'm talking to you.
-What did I say?

511
00:39:19,452 --> 00:39:20,744
Who fools people?

512
00:39:20,827 --> 00:39:24,703
You got offended.
You paint camouflage, don't you?

513
00:39:27,411 --> 00:39:31,077
-What do they give you in exchange?
-Who?

514
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:35,744
The ones you thanked for their concern
about the inmates' wellbeing.

515
00:39:36,327 --> 00:39:37,910
Nobody will give me anything.

516
00:39:37,994 --> 00:39:42,077
Nothing? You cover up their shit for free?

517
00:39:42,202 --> 00:39:44,744
-Step back.
-Go ahead, slap me.

518
00:39:49,494 --> 00:39:52,536
I wish you had the guts to slap me.
I really do.

519
00:39:55,494 --> 00:39:57,868
Being a man is not about growing a beard.

520
00:39:57,952 --> 00:40:00,703
You should have said that two weeks ago,

521
00:40:00,785 --> 00:40:03,619
Shakuri killed himself
after six years in jail.

522
00:40:56,285 --> 00:40:59,744
Hopefully, thanks to your intervention,
things will get sorted out

523
00:40:59,827 --> 00:41:01,160
and he'll be released.

524
00:41:01,244 --> 00:41:02,202
I hope so.

525
00:41:02,285 --> 00:41:05,035
You told me on the phone a few days ago...

526
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:07,160
-That day...
-Let me speak.

527
00:41:07,244 --> 00:41:09,577
You said he had 70 million, right?

528
00:41:09,661 --> 00:41:11,244
No. In fact,

529
00:41:11,327 --> 00:41:15,202
Mr. Taheri, the 70 million
was the value of the coins I found.

530
00:41:15,285 --> 00:41:19,619
I thought I could sell them
and pay back some of my debt.

531
00:41:19,703 --> 00:41:22,202
Then my conscience didn't allow me to.

532
00:41:22,411 --> 00:41:26,619
How come his conscience
doesn't bother him with me?

533
00:41:26,703 --> 00:41:30,119
Maybe he was wrong to be conscientious

534
00:41:30,202 --> 00:41:33,369
and give a poor woman her money back?

535
00:41:33,452 --> 00:41:35,994
Wouldn't you have felt bad
having her money?

536
00:41:36,077 --> 00:41:38,411
Can I talk to you in private?

537
00:41:40,077 --> 00:41:41,910
Please leave for a few minutes.

538
00:41:51,744 --> 00:41:52,952
I'm listening to you.

539
00:41:53,035 --> 00:41:57,160
How can you be sure
this story about the bag isn't made up?

540
00:41:57,244 --> 00:41:58,785
How can you be sure it is?

541
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:01,119
He's my sister-in-law's ex. I know him.

542
00:42:01,202 --> 00:42:04,952
That doesn't prove anything.
Anyhow, he made a human gesture.

543
00:42:05,035 --> 00:42:07,369
How did he become so human overnight?

544
00:42:07,452 --> 00:42:10,202
Why do you think his wife left him?

545
00:42:10,285 --> 00:42:12,994
Do you have any clear proof he's lying?

546
00:42:13,077 --> 00:42:14,952
-I do.
-Say, what is it?

547
00:42:15,035 --> 00:42:19,119
He's been bullshitting people
all his life.

548
00:42:19,202 --> 00:42:20,244
What bullshit?

549
00:42:20,327 --> 00:42:25,244
He said on TV he got a loan
and wasn't able to pay for it.

550
00:42:25,327 --> 00:42:27,411
-Well?
-Let me speak.

551
00:42:27,494 --> 00:42:31,827
What bank would give him a loan?
Why didn't he say it was a loan shark?

552
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:34,077
-So what?
-Why does he lie?

553
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:37,035
Maybe he was embarrassed. That's no proof.

554
00:42:38,119 --> 00:42:39,910
I don't want to slander him.

555
00:42:39,994 --> 00:42:44,494
But I warn you, Mr. Taheri,
if he doesn't pay me, I'll denounce him.

556
00:42:44,577 --> 00:42:45,910
Denounce what?

557
00:42:45,994 --> 00:42:50,619
If the owner of the bag hadn't called,
no one would have known.

558
00:42:50,703 --> 00:42:55,035
If he didn't want anyone to know,
why did he publicize the prison's number?

559
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:58,077
He should have left his cell phone number.

560
00:42:58,202 --> 00:43:00,119
There are no cell phones in jail.

561
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:02,661
So how could he text me?

562
00:43:02,744 --> 00:43:06,411
A text from jail?
Did he text you from jail?

563
00:43:09,035 --> 00:43:12,202
Mr. Taheri,
you know what his story's all about?

564
00:43:12,285 --> 00:43:13,703
Get to the point.

565
00:43:13,827 --> 00:43:18,119
Ever since he learned that his ex,
my sister-in-law,

566
00:43:18,244 --> 00:43:21,536
has been proposed to,
he's started to hassle me.

567
00:43:22,035 --> 00:43:26,827
He keeps calling and texting me
to get my consent to get out of jail.

568
00:43:26,910 --> 00:43:28,994
To stop her from getting married.

569
00:43:29,077 --> 00:43:31,952
His private life is none of my business.

570
00:43:32,035 --> 00:43:35,744
Listen to me.
You asked me to prove he's lying.

571
00:43:35,827 --> 00:43:37,202
He feels humiliated.

572
00:43:37,285 --> 00:43:41,035
He made up this story
to restore his reputation

573
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:43,910
and try to get his wife back.

574
00:43:43,994 --> 00:43:46,661
No, you're wrong. I have some information.

575
00:43:46,744 --> 00:43:48,077
That's all it's about.

576
00:43:48,577 --> 00:43:52,910
He has a partner. He plans
to marry her when he gets out.

577
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,285
You know what?

578
00:44:05,369 --> 00:44:08,452
I don't care whether
he found the bag or not.

579
00:44:08,536 --> 00:44:11,452
I want what's due after three years.

580
00:44:11,536 --> 00:44:13,785
Not in dribs and drabs.

581
00:44:13,868 --> 00:44:17,411
You've waited for three years.
Give him a few more days.

582
00:44:17,494 --> 00:44:20,827
I'll talk to him
and see how he can pay you back.

583
00:44:23,452 --> 00:44:24,785
And if he can't?

584
00:44:24,868 --> 00:44:26,744
It'll be up to you to decide.

585
00:44:31,369 --> 00:44:34,411
He's been granted special leave.

586
00:44:34,494 --> 00:44:36,494
-Hello, Hossein.
-Hello.

587
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:41,119
They'll get the creditor's consent
so he doesn't go back to jail.

588
00:44:41,452 --> 00:44:43,577
God willing. Let's hope.

589
00:44:43,661 --> 00:44:45,536
Yes, I'll pass him to you.

590
00:44:45,619 --> 00:44:48,202
Rahim... Rahim!

591
00:44:48,827 --> 00:44:50,452
Just a moment. He's coming.

592
00:44:55,744 --> 00:44:58,077
Be careful of the cars.

593
00:45:00,244 --> 00:45:03,661
-Hello.
-Hello, sweetheart, congratulations!

594
00:45:03,744 --> 00:45:04,952
Here you are.

595
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:06,536
What are you celebrating?

596
00:45:08,703 --> 00:45:12,910
My father was released.

597
00:45:12,994 --> 00:45:15,827
Wonderful. Wait,
I'll give you the bowl back.

598
00:45:15,910 --> 00:45:17,952
I saw him on TV.

599
00:45:19,244 --> 00:45:21,411
Who's so much trouble for?

600
00:45:21,494 --> 00:45:23,494
It's the talk of the neighborhood.

601
00:45:23,577 --> 00:45:26,744
At least ten people called
to say you make them proud.

602
00:45:26,827 --> 00:45:29,411
Some cousins are coming tonight.

603
00:45:29,494 --> 00:45:31,411
Do we have enough food?

604
00:45:31,494 --> 00:45:35,035
I'll do some shopping.
We'll have loads of people these days.

605
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:38,619
-Try this to see if it fits.
-Thanks a lot.

606
00:45:50,952 --> 00:45:53,577
-You might need this.
-I don't need it.

607
00:45:53,661 --> 00:45:55,369
Don't make a fuss.

608
00:45:56,494 --> 00:45:57,827
Thank you.

609
00:45:57,910 --> 00:46:01,077
Don't smoke in front of people.
It's not worthy of you.

610
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:02,619
Okay.

611
00:46:04,119 --> 00:46:06,119
-You distributed the soup?
-Yes.

612
00:46:06,202 --> 00:46:07,994
-Malih?
-Yes?

613
00:46:08,077 --> 00:46:10,494
-Get ready, we'll go somewhere.
-Where?

614
00:46:10,577 --> 00:46:13,411
-You'll see.
-Where?

615
00:46:13,494 --> 00:46:15,994
I'll tell you on the road.

616
00:46:18,910 --> 00:46:20,910
How did you find her?

617
00:46:21,868 --> 00:46:25,452
-She was my cellmate.
-No, seriously?

618
00:46:25,536 --> 00:46:28,619
She works at the speech therapy center.

619
00:46:29,077 --> 00:46:31,536
-Doesn't she mind your situation?
-No.

620
00:46:32,785 --> 00:46:36,160
-Does Siavash know?
-Not yet.

621
00:47:00,494 --> 00:47:03,952
-Aren't you alone?
-Maliheh wanted to see you.

622
00:47:04,035 --> 00:47:06,244
-Ask her in.
-Next time.

623
00:47:07,703 --> 00:47:09,785
-Is your brother home?
-Yes.

624
00:47:09,868 --> 00:47:12,619
-Ask him to come. Hello.
-Please come in.

625
00:47:12,703 --> 00:47:14,035
Thank you.

626
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:19,160
Call Morteza. He wants to talk to him.

627
00:47:23,494 --> 00:47:25,827
Don't make us look bad. Grow up a bit!

628
00:47:25,910 --> 00:47:28,577
He must have planned it with Farkhondeh.

629
00:47:28,994 --> 00:47:30,536
I already said no.

630
00:47:30,619 --> 00:47:32,744
If I go see him now, I'll say it again.

631
00:47:32,827 --> 00:47:36,160
-Don't try to force me.
-He isn't a murderer.

632
00:47:36,244 --> 00:47:40,119
Fine, he's a saint! He has a big kid.

633
00:47:40,202 --> 00:47:43,868
He's been to jail, he's got no job.
I'll never agree!

634
00:47:43,952 --> 00:47:46,868
Stop being so macho! Your sister's 37.

635
00:47:46,952 --> 00:47:51,827
I don't care who she sees.
She can do what she likes.

636
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:55,619
But she shouldn't come back here in tears,

637
00:47:55,703 --> 00:47:57,910
saying she wants to split up.

638
00:47:58,536 --> 00:48:01,994
Read that, then go
and tell him what you want.

639
00:48:02,077 --> 00:48:03,827
-What's that?
-Just read it.

640
00:48:04,661 --> 00:48:06,744
-I'm cold, Mom.
-Go get dressed.

641
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:29,202
Pass my best regards. Thank you.

642
00:48:29,285 --> 00:48:31,868
We have to go back soon. Thank you.

643
00:48:31,952 --> 00:48:36,452
Yes, he brought it yesterday.
Thank God it's all right.

644
00:48:42,035 --> 00:48:44,119
Beat it so that kids will dance.

645
00:48:44,202 --> 00:48:45,785
We're going to talk.

646
00:48:48,202 --> 00:48:50,160
-Beat it.
-Come on.

647
00:49:06,536 --> 00:49:08,619
And to your generosity...

648
00:49:18,661 --> 00:49:20,703
Good evening and thank you.

649
00:49:20,785 --> 00:49:25,035
We are very grateful for your support
to our charity association.

650
00:49:25,744 --> 00:49:28,077
First of all, Mr. Soltani...

651
00:49:31,244 --> 00:49:35,369
-Mr. Soltani, please join us.
-Give him a round of applause.

652
00:49:35,952 --> 00:49:41,910
-A round of applause for his noble deed.
-Yes!

653
00:49:42,619 --> 00:49:46,452
Mr. Soltani, in his TV interview,

654
00:49:46,536 --> 00:49:51,619
said that when he found the coins,
he thought it was a miracle.

655
00:49:51,703 --> 00:49:53,577
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

656
00:49:53,661 --> 00:49:57,369
Then he thought
God might have been testing him.

657
00:49:57,452 --> 00:50:02,703
I'd like to say to Mr. Soltani
it really is a miracle. You know why?

658
00:50:02,827 --> 00:50:06,119
I received a call earlier
from the local council.

659
00:50:06,202 --> 00:50:09,244
As a sign of appreciation
for his selfless courage,

660
00:50:09,327 --> 00:50:13,785
this gentleman will be offered a job
in their administration.

661
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:16,536
Great! Give him some applause.

662
00:50:20,536 --> 00:50:21,910
Thank you!

663
00:50:21,994 --> 00:50:27,827
We hope that, thanks to the efforts
of the prison management,

664
00:50:27,910 --> 00:50:31,910
also thanks to the town's benefactors
and your generosity,

665
00:50:31,994 --> 00:50:36,619
through your contribution tonight,
we can get his creditor's consent

666
00:50:36,703 --> 00:50:41,536
and have him return to his family
and dear son as soon as possible.

667
00:50:41,619 --> 00:50:45,285
-Thank you.
-Thanks so much!

668
00:50:45,369 --> 00:50:49,035
A round of applause for his noble deed!

669
00:50:52,202 --> 00:50:55,661
-Congratulations!
-Thank you.

670
00:50:56,703 --> 00:50:58,703
Mr. Soltani, please...

671
00:50:58,785 --> 00:51:02,577
-Please grant us a few words.
-Sure.

672
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:05,119
-Thank you.
-Excuse me.

673
00:51:06,452 --> 00:51:10,868
I must confess, at first, I was tempted

674
00:51:11,411 --> 00:51:15,202
to sell the coins and pay off my debt.

675
00:51:15,285 --> 00:51:18,577
But there was a mishap at the gold dealer.

676
00:51:18,703 --> 00:51:23,077
When he set out to calculate
the price of the coins,

677
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:24,827
his calculator broke down.

678
00:51:25,411 --> 00:51:29,160
He took a pen, but it didn't work either.

679
00:51:30,202 --> 00:51:35,994
I suddenly thought to myself
that these were signs.

680
00:51:36,327 --> 00:51:39,785
Signs which indicated
that wasn't the right thing to do

681
00:51:39,868 --> 00:51:42,035
and I should return it to the owner.

682
00:51:42,119 --> 00:51:44,744
Bravo! Congratulations.

683
00:51:47,868 --> 00:51:51,327
Thank you, Mr. Soltani. Congratulations!

684
00:51:51,411 --> 00:51:55,827
If you agree, we'll exchange
a few words with this young man.

685
00:51:56,202 --> 00:51:58,703
Anything you want to say
about your father?

686
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:00,661
-Yes.
-Go ahead.

687
00:52:00,744 --> 00:52:01,994
I...

688
00:52:06,744 --> 00:52:11,744
l like...

689
00:52:12,452 --> 00:52:17,994
Enough money...

690
00:52:19,577 --> 00:52:22,703
Debt...

691
00:52:23,994 --> 00:52:29,661
collected...

692
00:52:30,411 --> 00:52:34,119
Go... back...

693
00:52:35,494 --> 00:52:40,035
Jail... My own money...

694
00:52:40,119 --> 00:52:43,369
Good boy. How much do you want to give?

695
00:52:44,536 --> 00:52:47,536
Fifty thousand...

696
00:52:51,744 --> 00:52:52,827
tomans.

697
00:52:52,910 --> 00:52:56,577
Let's cheer for him!

698
00:53:50,285 --> 00:53:52,285
Bring the cakes from the kitchen.

699
00:53:56,202 --> 00:53:58,119
Why here, Sir? Please go inside.

700
00:54:06,661 --> 00:54:11,827
-Take this. 250,000 tomans.
-Yes.

701
00:54:12,452 --> 00:54:15,577
-100,000 tomans.
-Yes.

702
00:54:15,661 --> 00:54:17,536
Another 100,000 tomans.

703
00:54:17,619 --> 00:54:18,994
-Hello.
-Hello.

704
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:22,619
-Yes.
-And finally 500,000 tomans.

705
00:54:22,703 --> 00:54:25,244
32.750 million tomans.

706
00:54:25,327 --> 00:54:30,494
Plus 1.4 million tomans
in cash and a gold bracelet.

707
00:54:31,077 --> 00:54:36,077
That's a total of 34.150 million tomans.

708
00:54:36,202 --> 00:54:38,952
We'll evaluate the price of the bracelet.

709
00:54:39,077 --> 00:54:41,994
The prisoners chipped in
some 840,000 tomans.

710
00:54:42,077 --> 00:54:45,160
-I'll pay it to the association.
-Thank you.

711
00:54:45,244 --> 00:54:47,744
The warden and I will give 200,000 tomans.

712
00:54:47,827 --> 00:54:48,785
Thank you.

713
00:54:48,868 --> 00:54:52,411
-You've already done a lot.
-Our pleasure.

714
00:54:52,494 --> 00:54:56,952
Hossein, while we're here,
go get your checkbook...

715
00:54:57,077 --> 00:54:58,577
Wait a minute.

716
00:54:59,577 --> 00:55:04,910
My debt is 150 million tomans.
150 million from three years ago.

717
00:55:04,994 --> 00:55:07,827
What use is 34 or 35 million to me?

718
00:55:09,868 --> 00:55:13,577
Bahram, come on. Where are you going?

719
00:55:13,703 --> 00:55:16,327
The poor lady took off her bracelet,

720
00:55:16,411 --> 00:55:20,119
even the prisoners donated to get him out.

721
00:55:20,202 --> 00:55:21,536
Please cooperate too.

722
00:55:21,703 --> 00:55:24,035
You're talking as if I was cheating him.

723
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:27,577
He did a good deed.
You should make an effort...

724
00:55:27,661 --> 00:55:31,035
What good deed? What good deed?

725
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:35,494
Even if he found a bag
and returned it to its owner,

726
00:55:35,577 --> 00:55:37,827
it's only normal, he did his duty.

727
00:55:37,910 --> 00:55:39,536
Would you have returned it?

728
00:55:39,619 --> 00:55:41,244
Of course. Why not?

729
00:55:41,327 --> 00:55:46,202
You're not in jail for debt.
If you were and you had...

730
00:55:46,285 --> 00:55:47,785
Please, madam...

731
00:55:47,868 --> 00:55:53,285
Many people are in
far worse situations than him.

732
00:55:53,369 --> 00:55:57,244
They could steal and they don't.
Are they celebrated?

733
00:55:58,703 --> 00:56:03,452
I've never dishonored anybody.
Will I be given a certificate?

734
00:56:04,494 --> 00:56:08,244
Where in the world are people celebrated
for not doing wrong?

735
00:56:09,035 --> 00:56:11,536
Your problem is my merit certificate?

736
00:56:11,619 --> 00:56:13,994
My problem is you being so ungrateful.

737
00:56:14,119 --> 00:56:17,536
-Come here, Bahram.
-My problem is you being ungrateful.

738
00:56:17,619 --> 00:56:22,285
This certificate is the least we could do
for such a noble deed.

739
00:56:22,369 --> 00:56:25,827
What noble deed?
What noble deed did he do?

740
00:56:25,910 --> 00:56:27,244
What good did he do?

741
00:56:27,327 --> 00:56:32,119
I did good three years ago
because I considered him family.

742
00:56:32,202 --> 00:56:36,369
I gave a bond check to a loan shark
so he could start a business.

743
00:56:36,452 --> 00:56:39,327
I did good
when he didn't meet the payments.

744
00:56:39,411 --> 00:56:44,202
I sold my wife's jewelry to pay off
his debt, the interest and the penalties.

745
00:56:44,285 --> 00:56:45,285
God bless you.

746
00:56:45,369 --> 00:56:46,744
Now he's a hero,

747
00:56:46,827 --> 00:56:50,327
and me who did so much for him,
the bastard creditor?

748
00:56:50,411 --> 00:56:52,327
Not at all. God forbid.

749
00:56:52,785 --> 00:56:55,452
I had to sell my daughter's dowry for him.

750
00:56:59,035 --> 00:57:03,703
He wanted to sell the gold and give me
70 million tomans, but I refused.

751
00:57:03,785 --> 00:57:05,661
-Is that right?
-Yes, but...

752
00:57:05,744 --> 00:57:10,452
If I'd accepted it as part of his debt,
he'd come out of jail.

753
00:57:10,536 --> 00:57:15,369
Then would he have made
all this fuss about finding gold?

754
00:57:15,452 --> 00:57:19,619
It's because I refused
that he built up this story.

755
00:57:19,703 --> 00:57:21,785
I won't reply out of respect.

756
00:57:21,868 --> 00:57:24,411
Don't get on my nerves
or I'll grass you up.

757
00:57:24,494 --> 00:57:27,160
Stop it. There's a child here.

758
00:57:30,536 --> 00:57:33,619
-Bahram...
-Wait, Bahram. Wait!

759
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:37,952
Come here for a second.

760
00:57:43,452 --> 00:57:46,827
We've arranged for him
to be interviewed on TV.

761
00:57:46,910 --> 00:57:50,494
I'll have him call you during the show.

762
00:57:50,577 --> 00:57:54,910
Say that as he did a good deed,
you consent to have him released.

763
00:57:54,994 --> 00:58:00,077
So you teach a good lesson
to the audience and restore your image.

764
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:02,577
Will my image give my daughter a dowry?

765
00:58:02,661 --> 00:58:06,327
Anyway, if he pays this amount
to the court as bail,

766
00:58:06,411 --> 00:58:10,244
they'll stagger the rest of his debt,
and he'll be out.

767
00:58:13,703 --> 00:58:16,494
It's much nicer if you give your consent.

768
00:58:21,285 --> 00:58:24,744
If I agree, it's only for this poor kid.

769
00:58:24,827 --> 00:58:26,411
God bless you. Thank you.

770
00:58:26,536 --> 00:58:29,619
Write up the minutes and have it signed.

771
00:58:35,619 --> 00:58:38,785
-Hello.
-Can I help you?

772
00:58:38,868 --> 00:58:41,452
-I'm Rahim Soltani.
-Yes?

773
00:58:42,244 --> 00:58:44,285
-Ms. Radmehr sent me.
-Who?

774
00:58:44,369 --> 00:58:46,452
Mehrpooyan Charity Association.

775
00:58:46,536 --> 00:58:49,536
I've come to meet
the head of Human Resources.

776
00:58:49,619 --> 00:58:52,952
-You're the guy who was on TV.
-That's right.

777
00:58:53,703 --> 00:58:56,285
-I have an appointment at 11:00.
-Yes.

778
00:59:00,827 --> 00:59:02,327
Can I have your ID?

779
00:59:05,952 --> 00:59:08,744
It's this way, first floor. Mr. Nadeali.

780
00:59:08,827 --> 00:59:11,494
TRUSTWORTHY PRISONER RETURNS
A BAG FULL OF GOLD TO ITS OWNER

781
00:59:17,703 --> 00:59:21,202
I can do all kinds of jobs,
calligraphy, painting...

782
00:59:21,285 --> 00:59:22,536
Good for you.

783
00:59:22,661 --> 00:59:25,285
-At your service.
-Have some tea.

784
00:59:25,369 --> 00:59:26,452
Thank you.

785
00:59:26,952 --> 00:59:32,369
Tell me, the gentleman
you gave the coins back to...

786
00:59:32,452 --> 00:59:33,952
It was a lady.

787
00:59:34,035 --> 00:59:36,785
Can I have her number to call her?

788
00:59:36,868 --> 00:59:39,744
Her number... I don't have it.

789
00:59:39,827 --> 00:59:42,077
Didn't it show up on your phone?

790
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:44,536
She called the prison.

791
00:59:45,035 --> 00:59:46,744
Her address then?

792
00:59:47,035 --> 00:59:50,077
I don't think I've got it. Why?

793
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:52,077
You've got no information about her?

794
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:54,952
I never met her.
My sister gave her the bag.

795
00:59:55,035 --> 00:59:56,577
Is there any problem?

796
00:59:56,703 --> 01:00:00,536
Do you have any proof
you found this bag and gave it back?

797
01:00:00,619 --> 01:00:02,369
I have no proof.

798
01:00:02,952 --> 01:00:07,868
Just a merit certificate
from the charity where it's written.

799
01:00:07,952 --> 01:00:09,452
Any witnesses?

800
01:00:09,536 --> 01:00:11,119
The prison managers.

801
01:00:11,202 --> 01:00:12,703
Apart from them.

802
01:00:12,785 --> 01:00:15,994
My sister and my son are witnesses.
What's wrong?

803
01:00:16,077 --> 01:00:21,744
In order to approve your application,
I have to make sure of certain facts.

804
01:00:22,827 --> 01:00:24,285
What facts?

805
01:00:24,369 --> 01:00:27,661
-There are rumors going round.
-What rumors?

806
01:00:27,744 --> 01:00:32,244
That maybe your story's made up.

807
01:00:37,827 --> 01:00:38,994
Made up?

808
01:00:39,494 --> 01:00:43,035
What's wrong with my checking the facts?

809
01:00:45,868 --> 01:00:48,827
-Did my creditor contact you?
-No.

810
01:00:52,202 --> 01:00:54,952
Any of the inmates?

811
01:00:55,035 --> 01:01:00,160
No, on social media,
some rumors have spread.

812
01:01:01,411 --> 01:01:03,202
Are you doubting me?

813
01:01:03,285 --> 01:01:08,160
I'm not. But there's this rumor.

814
01:01:08,244 --> 01:01:09,744
Why?

815
01:01:09,827 --> 01:01:13,744
They say this story's made up
by the prison authorities,

816
01:01:13,827 --> 01:01:17,119
to create a diversion
from the recent suicide.

817
01:01:17,494 --> 01:01:21,619
-I swear on my son's life...
-Why are you swearing?

818
01:01:22,202 --> 01:01:25,244
-Didn't you bring the bag?
-Yes, I did.

819
01:01:25,327 --> 01:01:28,494
Ask the owner, your sister
and your son to come here,

820
01:01:28,577 --> 01:01:32,577
so I can ask them a few questions
and they'll sign a statement.

821
01:01:32,661 --> 01:01:37,994
If tomorrow some loony comes here,
I'll know how to shut his mouth.

822
01:01:38,077 --> 01:01:40,703
-Is it hard to do?
-No.

823
01:02:01,035 --> 01:02:04,244
Hello. How are you?

824
01:02:04,868 --> 01:02:08,452
Sorry to disturb you. A few days ago,

825
01:02:08,536 --> 01:02:13,452
a lady called me from this number.
If she's there, I'd like to talk to her.

826
01:02:13,536 --> 01:02:18,244
She came to our place by taxi
and called me from this number.

827
01:02:19,910 --> 01:02:21,536
Are you her husband?

828
01:02:24,327 --> 01:02:27,661
I see... Hello. How are you?

829
01:02:28,785 --> 01:02:29,785
I see.

830
01:02:30,119 --> 01:02:32,744
Do you have her address?

831
01:02:34,619 --> 01:02:35,661
Who is it?

832
01:02:40,494 --> 01:02:41,994
No, nothing's wrong.

833
01:02:45,077 --> 01:02:49,411
Thank you. Goodbye. Have a good day.

834
01:02:49,536 --> 01:02:50,619
So?

835
01:02:51,494 --> 01:02:55,785
It was the taxi driver who drove her here.
She called from his phone.

836
01:02:58,577 --> 01:03:01,619
Why didn't you ask for her number?

837
01:03:01,703 --> 01:03:04,536
She'd just called me,
the number showed up.

838
01:03:04,661 --> 01:03:07,160
How could I know it wasn't hers?

839
01:03:08,994 --> 01:03:12,494
Rahim, how come you didn't ask
for her address or number?

840
01:03:12,577 --> 01:03:16,035
How was I to know we'd need any of this?

841
01:03:18,785 --> 01:03:23,327
Didn't she give any information?
Where she lived, where she was going?

842
01:03:23,411 --> 01:03:25,035
I said all I can remember.

843
01:03:25,119 --> 01:03:28,160
-Remember anything else, kids?
-No.

844
01:03:28,827 --> 01:03:33,536
Uncle, she said nobody knew she had gold.
She was too scared to tell anyone.

845
01:03:34,703 --> 01:03:36,661
Take me to the council tomorrow.

846
01:03:36,744 --> 01:03:39,910
I'll tell them I saw her
and I gave her the bag.

847
01:03:39,994 --> 01:03:42,202
He insists on seeing her.

848
01:03:42,369 --> 01:03:45,494
I... saw...

849
01:03:47,119 --> 01:03:48,577
her.

850
01:03:48,703 --> 01:03:50,536
"I saw her."

851
01:03:52,202 --> 01:03:54,202
Malih, call the taxi driver again.

852
01:04:24,744 --> 01:04:27,744
When she got in, she was very agitated.

853
01:04:27,827 --> 01:04:30,411
I asked her what happened.
She said nothing.

854
01:04:30,494 --> 01:04:34,077
She asked if she could use my phone.

855
01:04:34,577 --> 01:04:37,452
-I think she called your sister, right?
-Yes.

856
01:04:37,536 --> 01:04:39,327
Did she talk to you on the road?

857
01:04:39,411 --> 01:04:42,411
No. But when she got back in
outside your place,

858
01:04:42,494 --> 01:04:46,160
I saw in the rear-view mirror
she was counting coins.

859
01:04:46,910 --> 01:04:51,285
She asked me to stop by a gold dealer.

860
01:04:51,868 --> 01:04:55,703
I found one, stopped, and she went in.

861
01:04:56,868 --> 01:04:58,119
What for?

862
01:04:58,952 --> 01:05:02,952
How would I know? She just went in.

863
01:05:03,952 --> 01:05:06,369
Was she dark-skinned?

864
01:05:06,785 --> 01:05:08,577
I didn't meet her.

865
01:05:09,327 --> 01:05:11,452
-About ten days ago?
-Yes.

866
01:05:11,536 --> 01:05:14,327
And her coins were not rimmed.

867
01:05:15,077 --> 01:05:18,619
She's the one who asked us to check
if the coins were real gold.

868
01:05:19,244 --> 01:05:21,910
-Seventeen of them.
-Yes, she came here.

869
01:05:21,994 --> 01:05:25,536
I checked them one by one
and told her they were gold.

870
01:05:26,619 --> 01:05:31,160
She asked the value.
She wanted to sell one.

871
01:05:31,244 --> 01:05:34,703
I found her a bit shifty
and said we weren't buying that day.

872
01:05:36,119 --> 01:05:37,494
Why shifty?

873
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:42,827
If the coins were hers, she wouldn't
have asked if they were real gold.

874
01:05:44,661 --> 01:05:46,868
Why? Were these coins yours?

875
01:05:57,494 --> 01:05:59,411
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

876
01:05:59,494 --> 01:06:02,369
Can I see the images from your cameras?

877
01:06:03,661 --> 01:06:06,910
You need a warrant from the police.

878
01:06:10,577 --> 01:06:13,619
Can I just take a picture of them
with my phone?

879
01:06:13,703 --> 01:06:14,952
No, sorry.

880
01:06:23,202 --> 01:06:27,744
Excuse me,
can you have a look at this certificate?

881
01:06:42,661 --> 01:06:45,369
I guess she wanted to check

882
01:06:45,452 --> 01:06:48,661
I hadn't replaced her coins
with fake ones.

883
01:06:49,536 --> 01:06:53,202
Listen. I don't want to worry you,

884
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:57,577
but if there was nothing wrong
with this woman,

885
01:06:57,661 --> 01:07:03,452
at least the day after,
she would have called to thank you.

886
01:07:04,619 --> 01:07:07,952
Can we go to where she got out?

887
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:12,661
Buying your recyclable items.

888
01:07:12,785 --> 01:07:14,202
She went that way.

889
01:07:25,369 --> 01:07:26,785
Keep your money.

890
01:07:26,868 --> 01:07:29,577
No, thank you. How much is it?

891
01:07:29,661 --> 01:07:31,285
I won't charge a prisoner.

892
01:07:31,369 --> 01:07:33,244
Please. It's not fair.

893
01:07:33,369 --> 01:07:35,285
Nothing is fair in this world.

894
01:07:35,369 --> 01:07:38,369
I also spent two years in jail unfairly.

895
01:07:39,411 --> 01:07:40,785
You're too kind.

896
01:07:41,952 --> 01:07:45,577
I hope you find her. But if you don't,

897
01:07:45,661 --> 01:07:49,785
just go there with another lady
and say you gave the bag to her.

898
01:07:49,868 --> 01:07:52,452
And if you need anything, call me.

899
01:09:00,452 --> 01:09:03,994
Aren't you the man
I saw on TV in the regional news?

900
01:09:04,077 --> 01:09:04,994
Yes.

901
01:09:05,077 --> 01:09:07,411
I thought you looked familiar.

902
01:09:08,077 --> 01:09:09,994
It's nice of you.

903
01:09:12,411 --> 01:09:14,994
-Here you are.
-Thank you.

904
01:09:16,994 --> 01:09:19,411
-How about this, Auntie?
-Let me see.

905
01:09:21,077 --> 01:09:24,536
No, that's too tight.
Go get something nicer.

906
01:09:24,619 --> 01:09:26,077
What's that?

907
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:28,785
Don't do that. Stop it.

908
01:09:29,369 --> 01:09:31,661
-Rahim, hurry up.
-Coming.

909
01:09:32,577 --> 01:09:35,868
-Is it working?
-No, it's not recording.

910
01:09:36,202 --> 01:09:39,785
Nima, go and ask the neighbor
for their DVD player.

911
01:09:39,868 --> 01:09:40,868
Okay.

912
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:49,910
-Say your uncle's on TV tonight!
-I will.

913
01:09:53,202 --> 01:09:57,119
You should take the woman's picture
and show it during the evening.

914
01:09:57,202 --> 01:09:58,619
Okay.

915
01:09:59,369 --> 01:10:01,785
-Did you tell your mom to watch?
-Yes.

916
01:10:01,868 --> 01:10:03,369
-Was she happy?
-A lot!

917
01:10:03,452 --> 01:10:04,577
Rahim, your phone.

918
01:10:04,661 --> 01:10:07,494
Come here, Rahim, I'll do your hair a bit.

919
01:10:07,577 --> 01:10:10,577
-Did you find one, sweetheart?
-Not yet.

920
01:10:10,703 --> 01:10:12,244
Hello?

921
01:10:13,952 --> 01:10:18,661
Who's calling?
Yes, how are you? Everything fine?

922
01:10:18,744 --> 01:10:22,035
"I'm very happy
and I'm proud of my father."

923
01:10:22,119 --> 01:10:25,536
I'm getting ready with my son
and then off we go.

924
01:10:25,661 --> 01:10:27,785
Happy...

925
01:10:28,577 --> 01:10:33,285
I am proud... of him.

926
01:10:33,369 --> 01:10:36,661
Try not to be stressed.
Put this on and let's try again.

927
01:10:36,744 --> 01:10:38,827
I'm happy,

928
01:10:38,994 --> 01:10:43,244
and I'm... proud...

929
01:10:43,327 --> 01:10:44,744
Nobody told me anything.

930
01:10:45,411 --> 01:10:47,577
Put on these pants my mom gave you.

931
01:10:47,661 --> 01:10:49,035
What happened?

932
01:10:50,994 --> 01:10:55,035
The thing is my son told his friends

933
01:10:55,119 --> 01:10:57,369
he'd be on TV tonight.

934
01:11:00,703 --> 01:11:02,202
Rahim, come to the yard.

935
01:11:09,785 --> 01:11:11,077
Anything wrong?

936
01:11:12,119 --> 01:11:14,994
-It's been canceled.
-What do you mean?

937
01:11:16,369 --> 01:11:17,327
Why?

938
01:11:18,577 --> 01:11:20,785
-Who called?
-The TV guy.

939
01:11:21,868 --> 01:11:23,327
Dad... this...

940
01:11:28,244 --> 01:11:29,369
Is it good?

941
01:11:33,160 --> 01:11:34,119
Dad?

942
01:11:43,035 --> 01:11:44,285
Dad?

943
01:11:50,411 --> 01:11:52,910
-What day was it?
-Tuesday.

944
01:11:53,452 --> 01:11:56,369
Tuesday before noon.
Probably around 10:00.

945
01:11:57,494 --> 01:12:01,411
This is the headquarters' number.
It's one of these two.

946
01:12:02,119 --> 01:12:03,827
Call her. I'll talk to her.

947
01:12:03,952 --> 01:12:05,577
-Thank you.
-Come with me.

948
01:12:07,244 --> 01:12:08,744
Who wrote this rubbish?

949
01:12:08,827 --> 01:12:13,577
Impossible to find out. Someone writes
something and it goes viral.

950
01:12:15,244 --> 01:12:19,494
I guess that's the reason why
the TV show was canceled.

951
01:12:19,577 --> 01:12:22,119
Maybe your ex-wife wanted to set you up?

952
01:12:24,411 --> 01:12:28,369
I don't think so.
She's living her own life.

953
01:12:28,494 --> 01:12:32,411
Why was your creditor threatening
to call her and ask about you?

954
01:12:33,577 --> 01:12:39,369
It's obvious. We split up,
so she won't praise me.

955
01:12:40,411 --> 01:12:42,202
Why did you split up?

956
01:12:43,785 --> 01:12:45,244
The truth is,

957
01:12:46,494 --> 01:12:49,661
we struggled, we couldn't live together.

958
01:12:51,285 --> 01:12:52,327
Well?

959
01:12:52,411 --> 01:12:55,119
A juice shop.
She called from there both times.

960
01:12:55,411 --> 01:12:57,703
What did the guy say? Did he know her?

961
01:12:57,785 --> 01:13:02,994
No, he said she was a passerby
who asked if she could use the phone.

962
01:13:03,703 --> 01:13:05,077
How strange.

963
01:13:05,577 --> 01:13:08,827
She's been careful not to leave any trail.

964
01:13:11,577 --> 01:13:15,202
Are you sure she was the owner of the bag?

965
01:13:15,285 --> 01:13:17,703
She gave the right description.

966
01:13:18,202 --> 01:13:20,285
Why did you give the jail's number?

967
01:13:21,244 --> 01:13:23,119
Why not your sister's?

968
01:13:24,077 --> 01:13:25,035
The truth is,

969
01:13:26,494 --> 01:13:30,202
I wanted to be the one
to tell her her bag was found.

970
01:13:30,785 --> 01:13:32,411
How come you had the number?

971
01:13:34,035 --> 01:13:35,035
Well?

972
01:13:36,536 --> 01:13:38,160
Ms. Marvasti gave it to me.

973
01:13:39,661 --> 01:13:40,703
What for?

974
01:13:41,411 --> 01:13:43,827
Once, when I went on leave,

975
01:13:43,910 --> 01:13:47,369
she needed some painting work
done at her home.

976
01:13:47,452 --> 01:13:50,411
So she gave me the number...

977
01:13:50,494 --> 01:13:53,369
You can go now. We'll see what happens.

978
01:14:00,244 --> 01:14:03,285
You talked to his sister,
did you suspect anything?

979
01:14:03,369 --> 01:14:06,703
-Like what?
-Like they might've made it all up.

980
01:14:07,785 --> 01:14:09,035
No.

981
01:14:11,952 --> 01:14:13,619
Call Ms. Marvasti.

982
01:14:15,202 --> 01:14:17,994
What if the taxi driver
was in cahoots with her?

983
01:14:18,619 --> 01:14:21,703
No, the poor guy even offered to help.

984
01:14:21,785 --> 01:14:25,077
There's something fishy about this woman.

985
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:27,536
The coins probably weren't hers.

986
01:14:27,619 --> 01:14:30,577
-You should tell the council.
-Tell them she's a thief?

987
01:14:30,661 --> 01:14:35,619
It's none of Rahim's business.
As long as he's returned the gold.

988
01:14:35,703 --> 01:14:37,119
To a thief.

989
01:14:37,202 --> 01:14:40,952
With what Bahram said,
they're already starting to have doubts.

990
01:14:41,035 --> 01:14:46,327
All we need now is for them to find out
Rahim gave the gold to a dodgy person.

991
01:14:46,411 --> 01:14:47,952
What do you mean, "dodgy"?

992
01:14:48,035 --> 01:14:51,994
She must be laying low
so nobody knows she had gold.

993
01:14:52,077 --> 01:14:55,577
It doesn't matter why,
but she's nowhere to be found.

994
01:14:56,785 --> 01:15:00,077
I don't know. I'm lost now.

995
01:15:00,868 --> 01:15:01,868
Thank you.

996
01:15:09,452 --> 01:15:11,369
-Malih...
-Yes?

997
01:15:14,119 --> 01:15:16,577
-There's one thing we can do.
-What?

998
01:15:18,160 --> 01:15:19,619
Ask Siavash to come.

999
01:15:22,035 --> 01:15:23,327
Siavash, come here.

1000
01:15:23,411 --> 01:15:25,744
-Do you want anything else?
-No, thanks.

1001
01:15:34,452 --> 01:15:35,494
Shut the door.

1002
01:16:02,411 --> 01:16:04,577
Mr. Nadeali will leave at 1:00 p.m.

1003
01:16:04,661 --> 01:16:08,536
The lady said she'd come at 12:30.
I'm sorry she's late.

1004
01:16:08,994 --> 01:16:11,577
-Goodbye.
-Have a nice day.

1005
01:16:11,868 --> 01:16:13,452
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

1006
01:16:13,577 --> 01:16:15,703
-Goodbye.
-You're welcome.

1007
01:16:19,577 --> 01:16:20,577
Hello.

1008
01:16:21,827 --> 01:16:24,160
-Hello.
-Hello, come in please.

1009
01:16:24,244 --> 01:16:25,952
Sorry, I'm late.

1010
01:16:26,035 --> 01:16:28,202
We're sorry to bother you.

1011
01:16:28,285 --> 01:16:29,785
-Not at all.
-Sit down.

1012
01:16:29,868 --> 01:16:32,369
-No, please.
-Come on, sit down.

1013
01:16:34,577 --> 01:16:37,035
-Please, sit here.
-No, don't worry.

1014
01:16:37,160 --> 01:16:38,661
Please sit down.

1015
01:16:43,494 --> 01:16:45,952
-Shall I let them in?
-Can you come in?

1016
01:16:46,411 --> 01:16:48,785
Bring me the newspaper please.

1017
01:17:02,411 --> 01:17:05,327
You stay here please.
He wants to see the lady alone.

1018
01:17:12,369 --> 01:17:14,160
-Hello.
-Hello.

1019
01:17:14,536 --> 01:17:18,202
Come in, please. Welcome. Take a seat.

1020
01:17:23,202 --> 01:17:27,536
-How are you doing?
-Fine, thanks.

1021
01:17:27,619 --> 01:17:31,411
You should have given him your number.

1022
01:17:31,868 --> 01:17:35,452
-I was afraid.
-Why?

1023
01:17:35,536 --> 01:17:37,868
I didn't tell my husband I lost my bag.

1024
01:17:38,744 --> 01:17:41,369
Once it's found, why wouldn't he know?

1025
01:17:41,452 --> 01:17:44,077
I don't want him to know we've got gold.

1026
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:46,452
He'd spend it right away.

1027
01:17:46,536 --> 01:17:50,577
I've been struggling weaving carpets
to earn them one by one.

1028
01:17:50,703 --> 01:17:54,536
-What does your husband do?
-He doesn't work.

1029
01:17:54,619 --> 01:17:58,744
Someone who works so hard to earn
a living should be more careful.

1030
01:18:02,244 --> 01:18:05,619
I wanted to sell them
and put the money in the bank.

1031
01:18:06,577 --> 01:18:10,536
Every time I went out, I was worried

1032
01:18:10,661 --> 01:18:12,744
he'd find it and squander them.

1033
01:18:12,827 --> 01:18:15,160
I thought it was better to sell them...

1034
01:18:15,285 --> 01:18:18,160
-With the driver sitting outside?
-Yes.

1035
01:18:18,244 --> 01:18:19,994
-You went to their place?
-Yes.

1036
01:18:20,077 --> 01:18:24,452
Yes, he took me there. He waited for me.
Then, with the lady...

1037
01:18:24,536 --> 01:18:29,035
The lady, his sister, gave me the bag.

1038
01:18:29,119 --> 01:18:32,327
And the driver took me home.

1039
01:18:32,411 --> 01:18:35,452
You took a taxi for such a long trip?

1040
01:18:38,369 --> 01:18:40,536
I was so stressed.

1041
01:18:40,619 --> 01:18:43,119
I wanted to go and take the bag quickly.

1042
01:18:43,202 --> 01:18:44,619
Okay, madam...

1043
01:18:44,703 --> 01:18:47,160
-You'll have to write...
-Okay.

1044
01:18:48,119 --> 01:18:50,369
And explain all that. Then sign it.

1045
01:18:52,411 --> 01:18:54,494
-Shall I sit outside?
-No, here.

1046
01:19:13,119 --> 01:19:14,285
Let them in.

1047
01:19:20,661 --> 01:19:24,202
-Here. Is it okay?
-Thank you very much.

1048
01:19:25,577 --> 01:19:28,619
Please read the lady's statement
and sign it.

1049
01:19:30,035 --> 01:19:32,285
And you sign as a witness.

1050
01:19:32,452 --> 01:19:33,827
-Okay.
-Thank you.

1051
01:19:38,285 --> 01:19:40,244
-Thank you.
-Here you are.

1052
01:19:40,868 --> 01:19:43,160
-Thanks so much.
-You're welcome.

1053
01:19:43,661 --> 01:19:45,285
We caused you trouble.

1054
01:19:45,910 --> 01:19:49,119
-We're very grateful.
-You are welcome.

1055
01:19:51,910 --> 01:19:53,202
Are we done?

1056
01:19:53,285 --> 01:19:55,661
You can go, you'll be kept informed.

1057
01:19:56,868 --> 01:19:59,411
-God bless you.
-Thank you.

1058
01:19:59,536 --> 01:20:01,868
Thank you, madam, for your time.

1059
01:20:01,952 --> 01:20:04,244
It's very kind of you.

1060
01:20:04,327 --> 01:20:05,910
-You're welcome.
-Goodbye.

1061
01:20:05,994 --> 01:20:07,494
-Thank you.
-Goodbye.

1062
01:20:11,202 --> 01:20:13,577
-Thank you.
-Goodbye.

1063
01:20:13,661 --> 01:20:17,452
-Thank you.
-Goodbye.

1064
01:20:19,577 --> 01:20:24,035
Excuse me, when do you think
I'll start the job?

1065
01:20:24,119 --> 01:20:27,035
First, the statement must be verified.

1066
01:20:27,868 --> 01:20:30,536
-What needs to be verified?
-Everything.

1067
01:20:30,619 --> 01:20:34,452
But he's giving checks to his creditor
relying on this job.

1068
01:20:34,536 --> 01:20:36,619
For now, don't count on the job.

1069
01:20:36,703 --> 01:20:39,744
Let's see if he meets the requirements.

1070
01:20:39,827 --> 01:20:43,744
You said you just wanted
to question this lady.

1071
01:20:43,827 --> 01:20:46,202
I went to a lot of trouble to find her.

1072
01:20:46,285 --> 01:20:48,369
This gentleman is my witness.

1073
01:20:48,452 --> 01:20:50,994
Ask them as many questions as you want.

1074
01:20:51,077 --> 01:20:53,952
I'm at your service
if you have any questions.

1075
01:20:54,035 --> 01:20:58,202
Do you want him to tell you
about the day he drove her?

1076
01:20:58,285 --> 01:21:00,785
I picked up the lady on the street.

1077
01:21:00,868 --> 01:21:04,952
She called this lady with my phone
and described her bag.

1078
01:21:05,077 --> 01:21:06,494
-Is that right?
-Yes.

1079
01:21:06,577 --> 01:21:08,452
I gave the bag to this lady.

1080
01:21:08,536 --> 01:21:10,452
My nephew is my witness.

1081
01:21:12,536 --> 01:21:13,619
Tell the gentleman.

1082
01:21:14,910 --> 01:21:17,910
Sir... this...

1083
01:21:20,536 --> 01:21:21,952
Lady...

1084
01:21:28,411 --> 01:21:29,910
He can't speak well.

1085
01:21:29,994 --> 01:21:32,952
The lady gave him 50,000 tomans
as a reward.

1086
01:21:33,035 --> 01:21:33,994
Yes.

1087
01:21:37,952 --> 01:21:39,744
Could you please wait outside?

1088
01:21:43,703 --> 01:21:45,035
Shut the door please.

1089
01:21:48,077 --> 01:21:51,994
-When did you find this bag?
-The day of my leave.

1090
01:21:52,077 --> 01:21:56,703
You wanted to sell the coins
and give 70 million to your creditor?

1091
01:21:56,785 --> 01:22:01,160
Yes, I talked to him the same day
and he agreed.

1092
01:22:01,244 --> 01:22:04,661
But I couldn't bring myself to do it.

1093
01:22:04,744 --> 01:22:09,494
But a week before finding it,
you had already offered him 75 million.

1094
01:22:11,244 --> 01:22:14,785
Me? No, I didn't. Who said that?

1095
01:22:21,244 --> 01:22:24,577
"Hello, Bahram. I've got 75 million.

1096
01:22:24,661 --> 01:22:28,619
"I'll give you checks
for the rest if I get out.

1097
01:22:28,703 --> 01:22:29,744
"Rahim."

1098
01:22:30,910 --> 01:22:33,285
I sent it the day I found the bag.

1099
01:22:33,369 --> 01:22:35,077
It's dated a week before.

1100
01:22:35,160 --> 01:22:39,035
My brother was in jail a week before.
How could he find a bag?

1101
01:22:39,119 --> 01:22:40,744
That's my question.

1102
01:22:40,827 --> 01:22:44,035
One week before
supposedly finding the coins,

1103
01:22:44,119 --> 01:22:46,494
how could you promise him 75 million?

1104
01:22:46,577 --> 01:22:49,244
-I didn't.
-Come on, it's your text.

1105
01:22:49,661 --> 01:22:51,202
I got it yesterday.

1106
01:22:51,285 --> 01:22:55,536
How can I prove
I returned them to their owner?

1107
01:22:55,619 --> 01:22:58,536
-To her?
-Yes.

1108
01:22:58,619 --> 01:23:01,369
-Now you have the coins?
-Yes, I have them.

1109
01:23:01,494 --> 01:23:03,785
Then you go now with the driver,

1110
01:23:03,910 --> 01:23:07,369
and bring the bag and the 17 coins.
And you stay here.

1111
01:23:09,369 --> 01:23:10,785
My husband is at home.

1112
01:23:12,244 --> 01:23:17,868
I sneaked out for this poor man.
I can't go home and leave again.

1113
01:23:17,952 --> 01:23:19,577
-Call your husband.
-What for?

1114
01:23:19,661 --> 01:23:24,827
I'll explain the whole story to him
so he doesn't bother you.

1115
01:23:24,910 --> 01:23:26,244
My husband...

1116
01:23:27,327 --> 01:23:29,035
Didn't I tell you?

1117
01:23:29,119 --> 01:23:33,244
Didn't I tell you my husband
has no idea about the coins?

1118
01:23:33,327 --> 01:23:34,494
I'm sorry.

1119
01:23:34,577 --> 01:23:37,703
Excuse me, but you're behaving very badly

1120
01:23:37,785 --> 01:23:42,494
with a prisoner who's gone
to so much trouble to do a good deed.

1121
01:23:42,577 --> 01:23:46,452
If it's proven tomorrow this was a fraud,
will you answer for it?

1122
01:23:46,536 --> 01:23:47,619
What fraud?

1123
01:23:47,703 --> 01:23:49,369
We received a call here...

1124
01:23:49,452 --> 01:23:52,868
I know who called you.
My creditor sent you the text.

1125
01:23:52,952 --> 01:23:53,868
It's not him.

1126
01:23:53,952 --> 01:23:57,868
This man is sick. He ruined my life
and my wife left me.

1127
01:23:57,952 --> 01:24:00,619
-None of my business.
-What is your business?

1128
01:24:00,703 --> 01:24:03,619
I wish I could confirm that you did that.

1129
01:24:03,703 --> 01:24:08,119
At my age, would I give
false evidence to someone I don't know?

1130
01:24:08,202 --> 01:24:10,661
This is our procedure.

1131
01:24:10,744 --> 01:24:12,369
Who's your boss here?

1132
01:24:13,785 --> 01:24:18,077
Who are you to get so worked up about him?

1133
01:24:18,160 --> 01:24:20,661
I'm nobody, young man.

1134
01:24:21,452 --> 01:24:23,160
You who are somebody,

1135
01:24:23,244 --> 01:24:27,035
why are you accusing
this poor innocent guy?

1136
01:24:27,119 --> 01:24:30,827
Get out, sir. Mr. Saghafi! Get them out!

1137
01:24:32,160 --> 01:24:34,619
-Please leave.
-Go away.

1138
01:24:34,785 --> 01:24:36,035
Please leave.

1139
01:24:36,119 --> 01:24:38,910
I pity this country
for being in the hands of you guys.

1140
01:24:40,202 --> 01:24:42,910
The only thing that matters is my honor.

1141
01:24:42,994 --> 01:24:45,452
I don't want this job or the salary.

1142
01:24:46,327 --> 01:24:50,952
I swear I'll spread the word
that you didn't keep your promise.

1143
01:24:51,035 --> 01:24:52,452
I'll denounce you all.

1144
01:24:52,536 --> 01:24:54,868
Do whatever you want, but be quiet.

1145
01:25:42,703 --> 01:25:44,452
Come out when you're done.

1146
01:25:46,077 --> 01:25:47,452
You can speak here.

1147
01:25:52,827 --> 01:25:55,285
-Why did you do that?
-Do what?

1148
01:25:55,952 --> 01:25:59,827
-Forward the text to that guy.
-What guy?

1149
01:25:59,910 --> 01:26:02,868
-The council intelligence.
-Intelligence?

1150
01:26:02,952 --> 01:26:05,577
What are you talking about?

1151
01:26:05,661 --> 01:26:07,994
-Why are you doing this?
-What am I doing?

1152
01:26:08,077 --> 01:26:11,035
Why do you threaten to denounce me?

1153
01:26:11,119 --> 01:26:12,494
I did nothing wrong.

1154
01:26:12,577 --> 01:26:14,994
-Why did you call them?
-I called nobody.

1155
01:26:15,077 --> 01:26:18,035
Look, I've brought you these checks.

1156
01:26:18,744 --> 01:26:23,119
With what you've done,
how can I find a job and pay you back?

1157
01:26:23,202 --> 01:26:24,910
Now they're doubting me.

1158
01:26:25,868 --> 01:26:28,369
They're not.
They've seen your true colors.

1159
01:26:28,452 --> 01:26:29,868
Don't interfere.

1160
01:26:34,452 --> 01:26:37,244
Why was I fooled by you again?

1161
01:26:48,577 --> 01:26:50,536
How dare you come here?

1162
01:26:51,202 --> 01:26:53,202
Don't you see how changed he is?

1163
01:26:54,536 --> 01:26:56,244
You've worn him out.

1164
01:26:56,827 --> 01:26:58,952
-What have I done?
-You did everything.

1165
01:26:59,452 --> 01:27:01,577
I was plagued by bad luck, Nazanin.

1166
01:27:03,327 --> 01:27:04,536
I went bankrupt.

1167
01:27:04,619 --> 01:27:09,369
After all he did for you, how can you go
and slander him on TV?

1168
01:27:10,785 --> 01:27:13,494
If you had a little pride,
you wouldn't show up here.

1169
01:27:34,202 --> 01:27:36,952
Didn't we agree at the charity?

1170
01:27:37,035 --> 01:27:39,994
That instead of paying me,
you'd insult me?

1171
01:27:40,077 --> 01:27:44,827
-Bahram, are you jealous?
-Jealous of what?

1172
01:27:44,910 --> 01:27:46,744
What would I envy you for?

1173
01:27:46,827 --> 01:27:49,577
That people have esteem for me.

1174
01:27:49,661 --> 01:27:52,202
Poor people who consider you their hero.

1175
01:27:52,327 --> 01:27:56,077
Poor you who can't stand
seeing people show me respect.

1176
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:59,452
You think you're somebody
because you were on TV?

1177
01:27:59,536 --> 01:28:00,910
Watch your mouth.

1178
01:28:01,035 --> 01:28:03,994
They build you up
to say the country is a paradise.

1179
01:28:04,077 --> 01:28:05,077
Be polite.

1180
01:28:05,202 --> 01:28:06,910
"People show me respect..."

1181
01:28:07,619 --> 01:28:09,202
People show you respect?

1182
01:28:09,952 --> 01:28:11,619
People feel sorry for you.

1183
01:28:12,411 --> 01:28:16,119
They feel sorry
for your poor kid's stutter and for you,

1184
01:28:16,244 --> 01:28:19,035
who drags him in front of people
to cry and beg.

1185
01:28:19,494 --> 01:28:21,327
"People show me respect."

1186
01:28:22,703 --> 01:28:25,577
"The pen didn't work,
the calculator either..."

1187
01:28:29,703 --> 01:28:30,952
Come here a second.

1188
01:28:31,744 --> 01:28:34,868
-Leave, please.
-Just a second, Nazanin.

1189
01:28:34,952 --> 01:28:39,285
Just a second. I want to see him.

1190
01:28:39,369 --> 01:28:43,202
Stop it! Leave him alone!

1191
01:28:43,952 --> 01:28:45,868
Bastard!

1192
01:28:47,119 --> 01:28:48,411
Stop!

1193
01:28:50,744 --> 01:28:52,285
Bastard!

1194
01:28:53,577 --> 01:28:55,452
Stop, Dad!

1195
01:29:05,411 --> 01:29:08,327
Ali! Sattar, come quick!

1196
01:29:12,994 --> 01:29:15,119
Take him away.

1197
01:29:17,577 --> 01:29:19,744
Don't let him go away.

1198
01:29:24,244 --> 01:29:25,744
Hello, police?

1199
01:29:27,661 --> 01:29:29,327
Where are you taking me?

1200
01:29:33,202 --> 01:29:34,910
Why are you doing this?

1201
01:29:35,868 --> 01:29:37,661
Call the police.

1202
01:29:37,744 --> 01:29:39,202
Let me out.

1203
01:29:59,744 --> 01:30:03,202
Get back to your tasks please. It's over.

1204
01:30:05,452 --> 01:30:06,577
Who was that?

1205
01:30:14,577 --> 01:30:18,202
Rahim! What happened to you?

1206
01:30:26,369 --> 01:30:29,452
Open this door! Why is he locked in?

1207
01:30:29,536 --> 01:30:31,494
We're waiting for the police.

1208
01:30:32,744 --> 01:30:35,035
-Did he hit you?
-I'm okay.

1209
01:31:05,827 --> 01:31:07,244
Get out!

1210
01:31:07,868 --> 01:31:09,744
Let him out.

1211
01:31:09,868 --> 01:31:11,785
Open the door for him.

1212
01:31:17,244 --> 01:31:18,327
Madam!

1213
01:31:18,411 --> 01:31:19,661
His shoe...

1214
01:31:26,577 --> 01:31:29,785
Open the door. Open it, please.

1215
01:31:39,327 --> 01:31:40,952
Put on your shoe.

1216
01:31:58,244 --> 01:31:59,327
Hello.

1217
01:31:59,411 --> 01:32:01,202
-Hello, is your dad home?
-Yes.

1218
01:32:01,285 --> 01:32:03,327
Why doesn't he answer the phone?

1219
01:32:03,411 --> 01:32:05,868
-Tell him to come quick.
-Okay.

1220
01:32:10,994 --> 01:32:12,744
Ms. Radmehr...

1221
01:32:13,577 --> 01:32:15,035
I'll call you later.

1222
01:32:15,119 --> 01:32:16,369
Ms. Radmehr...

1223
01:32:17,910 --> 01:32:19,536
-Hello.
-Hello.

1224
01:32:20,160 --> 01:32:21,452
Hello.

1225
01:32:22,035 --> 01:32:24,703
Mr. Soltani, what got into you?

1226
01:32:25,411 --> 01:32:26,452
What do you mean?

1227
01:32:26,619 --> 01:32:29,244
Sheyda! Bring my phone and show him.

1228
01:32:35,744 --> 01:32:38,744
This is what happened today
in my father's shop.

1229
01:32:38,827 --> 01:32:42,035
The man you see attacking him

1230
01:32:42,119 --> 01:32:45,994
is the one who was presented on TV

1231
01:32:46,077 --> 01:32:48,577
a few days ago and praised

1232
01:32:48,703 --> 01:32:52,703
as a very conscientious
and trustworthy prisoner who returned

1233
01:32:52,827 --> 01:32:54,994
a bag full of gold to its owner.

1234
01:32:55,119 --> 01:32:58,994
Since the beginning,
my father told jail management

1235
01:32:59,077 --> 01:33:04,827
and the charity who raised funds
for such a man

1236
01:33:04,910 --> 01:33:07,577
that this story was fake.

1237
01:33:07,744 --> 01:33:12,744
But for dubious reasons,
they didn't pay attention to him.

1238
01:33:12,827 --> 01:33:16,661
The woman who came to the shop
seems to be his girlfriend.

1239
01:33:17,536 --> 01:33:18,994
Did he share that?

1240
01:33:19,119 --> 01:33:21,202
His daughter sent it to Ms. Radmehr

1241
01:33:21,327 --> 01:33:24,952
saying she'll share it
if they're not paid by tomorrow.

1242
01:33:25,077 --> 01:33:26,827
He started insulting me.

1243
01:33:26,952 --> 01:33:30,952
The video speaks for itself.
You attacked him by surprise.

1244
01:33:31,035 --> 01:33:35,202
Now that you're known as a role model
that people follow,

1245
01:33:35,285 --> 01:33:37,661
you can't behave like that.

1246
01:33:37,744 --> 01:33:42,035
Every year, we provide dowers
for needy brides.

1247
01:33:42,119 --> 01:33:46,244
We pay recompenses
for convicts to avoid the death penalty.

1248
01:33:46,327 --> 01:33:49,285
If this is shared,
nobody will trust us anymore.

1249
01:33:49,411 --> 01:33:50,785
Nobody will support us.

1250
01:33:50,868 --> 01:33:53,536
-That's not my fault.
-Not your fault?

1251
01:33:53,619 --> 01:33:57,703
Your creditor's daughter
also sent the video to the council.

1252
01:33:57,785 --> 01:34:00,160
They called me today and said

1253
01:34:00,285 --> 01:34:03,952
the lady in the video,
who's apparently related to you,

1254
01:34:04,035 --> 01:34:08,536
went to the council and claimed
she was the one who lost her bag

1255
01:34:08,619 --> 01:34:11,119
and got it back from you, is that right?

1256
01:34:13,619 --> 01:34:15,619
I had no choice.

1257
01:34:16,327 --> 01:34:18,411
I couldn't find the owner.

1258
01:34:23,285 --> 01:34:24,785
If the video gets out,

1259
01:34:25,494 --> 01:34:28,202
will people's trust in us
ever be restored?

1260
01:34:28,868 --> 01:34:30,910
Who would want to help us?

1261
01:34:31,827 --> 01:34:37,202
You've harmed all the people
this charity could help.

1262
01:34:37,285 --> 01:34:39,910
-At least, let me explain.
-Go ahead.

1263
01:34:40,411 --> 01:34:41,952
Let him explain.

1264
01:34:43,452 --> 01:34:44,703
The truth is,

1265
01:34:45,868 --> 01:34:48,327
this bag was found by a lady.

1266
01:34:48,411 --> 01:34:49,744
What lady?

1267
01:34:50,952 --> 01:34:52,577
The lady in the video.

1268
01:34:52,661 --> 01:34:54,952
Why did you say you found it?

1269
01:34:55,202 --> 01:34:59,619
I told the prison authorities
a lady found it and gave it to me.

1270
01:35:00,119 --> 01:35:03,160
They said it didn't matter,
I could say it was me.

1271
01:35:04,202 --> 01:35:08,202
-So you didn't find it.
-You played with our reputation.

1272
01:35:09,077 --> 01:35:15,035
We've been struggling for 25 years
to try and help destitute people.

1273
01:35:15,119 --> 01:35:17,035
You ruined it all overnight.

1274
01:35:17,119 --> 01:35:20,827
I'll ask this lady
to come and explain everything.

1275
01:35:20,952 --> 01:35:21,994
The lady!

1276
01:35:22,077 --> 01:35:25,744
Everywhere you said you found it,
you made it all up.

1277
01:35:25,827 --> 01:35:28,202
What is it all about? Tell me the truth.

1278
01:35:28,327 --> 01:35:29,785
I've told the truth.

1279
01:35:30,452 --> 01:35:32,244
-It's the truth.
-Give me a break.

1280
01:35:33,202 --> 01:35:37,952
I'll call your creditor.
Apologize so he doesn't share it.

1281
01:35:38,077 --> 01:35:40,910
Come on, they're waiting for you.
They want to leave.

1282
01:35:41,285 --> 01:35:43,369
Just let me make a phone call.

1283
01:35:43,910 --> 01:35:47,494
If a scandal breaks out and we have to
justify ourselves and apologize,

1284
01:35:47,577 --> 01:35:48,994
it'll be hellish.

1285
01:35:49,077 --> 01:35:52,619
They're trying to talk the creditor
out of sharing the video.

1286
01:35:52,744 --> 01:35:57,285
We have to make a statement anyway.
They trusted us.

1287
01:35:57,369 --> 01:36:00,035
-Let's do it today.
-And say what?

1288
01:36:01,327 --> 01:36:03,994
That we checked afterwards

1289
01:36:04,119 --> 01:36:07,369
and realized the story
wasn't crystal clear.

1290
01:36:07,494 --> 01:36:10,952
Therefore, the money collected
will stay in the charity.

1291
01:36:11,035 --> 01:36:14,035
Let's use it
for this poor guy's recompense.

1292
01:36:14,411 --> 01:36:16,868
-I agree.
-Excuse me.

1293
01:36:18,035 --> 01:36:19,035
My father...

1294
01:36:20,035 --> 01:36:21,619
didn't...

1295
01:36:22,494 --> 01:36:23,494
lie.

1296
01:36:24,327 --> 01:36:25,494
Sweetheart...

1297
01:36:26,119 --> 01:36:29,411
We're not saying he lied.

1298
01:36:30,160 --> 01:36:33,285
The problem is
we don't understand what he says.

1299
01:36:35,952 --> 01:36:38,577
If you transfer the money tonight,

1300
01:36:38,703 --> 01:36:42,827
Rahim will give him checks for the rest
and he won't share the video.

1301
01:36:42,910 --> 01:36:46,202
We can't give him the money
after what's happened.

1302
01:36:46,327 --> 01:36:47,411
Why not?

1303
01:36:47,494 --> 01:36:49,077
Morally, every donor

1304
01:36:49,160 --> 01:36:52,910
must be informed and decide
if they want their money back

1305
01:36:52,994 --> 01:36:55,202
or accept to give it to another person.

1306
01:36:55,285 --> 01:36:57,119
The money was collected for him.

1307
01:36:57,202 --> 01:37:01,285
No, it was thanks
to our dependable reputation.

1308
01:37:01,369 --> 01:37:02,994
It's us they trusted.

1309
01:37:03,119 --> 01:37:04,868
I'm not denying it.

1310
01:37:04,952 --> 01:37:09,327
Would it be fair to give the money
that was entrusted to us by prisoners,

1311
01:37:09,452 --> 01:37:13,827
in spite of their difficulties,
to somebody who's lied to us?

1312
01:37:13,952 --> 01:37:15,327
Let me explain to you.

1313
01:37:15,411 --> 01:37:17,577
-Explain what?
-What you're saying...

1314
01:37:17,661 --> 01:37:21,619
You took a lady to the council
saying you gave her the gold

1315
01:37:21,703 --> 01:37:24,077
and now we find out she's your friend.

1316
01:37:24,160 --> 01:37:25,577
What's left to explain?

1317
01:37:26,452 --> 01:37:28,661
Listen, in any case,

1318
01:37:28,744 --> 01:37:31,952
if the video is shared,
it'd be a disaster for you.

1319
01:37:32,035 --> 01:37:33,285
Now we're to blame.

1320
01:37:33,369 --> 01:37:36,285
It's not about blaming. I just mean

1321
01:37:36,952 --> 01:37:39,619
it'd harm everyone,
especially the charity.

1322
01:37:43,785 --> 01:37:48,536
Mr. Taghian, call and ask him
not to share it until we find a solution.

1323
01:37:48,619 --> 01:37:49,661
I'm off.

1324
01:37:49,744 --> 01:37:51,619
His daughter won't let it go.

1325
01:37:51,703 --> 01:37:53,369
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

1326
01:37:53,452 --> 01:37:57,452
I returned the bag. Please, madam!

1327
01:37:57,536 --> 01:37:59,494
You paid us back very badly.

1328
01:37:59,619 --> 01:38:00,577
Hello.

1329
01:38:00,661 --> 01:38:02,119
Hello, please go in.

1330
01:38:02,202 --> 01:38:03,452
Goodbye.

1331
01:38:27,703 --> 01:38:28,910
Dad?

1332
01:38:32,285 --> 01:38:33,411
Yes, son?

1333
01:38:46,244 --> 01:38:47,202
Why did...

1334
01:38:48,035 --> 01:38:52,077
Ms. Zareh give you...

1335
01:38:54,744 --> 01:38:55,827
the coins?

1336
01:38:56,577 --> 01:38:58,536
To get me out of prison.

1337
01:39:01,494 --> 01:39:04,452
Are you going to get...

1338
01:39:05,452 --> 01:39:06,703
remarried too?

1339
01:39:15,285 --> 01:39:17,244
I won't, if you don't want me to.

1340
01:39:33,077 --> 01:39:34,244
Siavash, darling.

1341
01:39:39,244 --> 01:39:40,327
Look at me.

1342
01:39:41,077 --> 01:39:42,952
Siavash. Come here, son.

1343
01:39:47,952 --> 01:39:49,285
Come on.

1344
01:40:04,994 --> 01:40:06,369
I told Mr. Taheri.

1345
01:40:06,452 --> 01:40:08,411
You said your wife found it.

1346
01:40:08,494 --> 01:40:12,619
I didn't say my wife.
I said the lady I was going to marry.

1347
01:40:12,703 --> 01:40:16,160
And what did I tell you?
To repeat the same thing.

1348
01:40:16,244 --> 01:40:19,035
No, you said it was no use
saying all that.

1349
01:40:19,119 --> 01:40:20,452
You're lying to my face?

1350
01:40:20,536 --> 01:40:22,785
You told me that in the other room.

1351
01:40:22,868 --> 01:40:24,910
Ms. Marvasti was there. I can call her.

1352
01:40:24,994 --> 01:40:27,661
Come here. I told you to repeat the same.

1353
01:40:27,744 --> 01:40:31,494
You said you couldn't name her
out of discretion.

1354
01:40:31,577 --> 01:40:32,703
I wanted...

1355
01:40:32,785 --> 01:40:34,661
Did I ask you to say it was a loan?

1356
01:40:34,744 --> 01:40:38,785
The TV people did.
They asked me not to mention usury.

1357
01:40:38,910 --> 01:40:42,661
And going in front of the camera
on the sidewalk,

1358
01:40:42,744 --> 01:40:46,285
and claiming you found it exactly there
was also their idea?

1359
01:40:46,369 --> 01:40:51,369
You told the TV people
to come and film me.

1360
01:40:52,369 --> 01:40:56,536
I never thought anyone
should find out about this story.

1361
01:40:56,619 --> 01:41:02,452
If you didn't want anyone to know,
you'd have given your sister's number.

1362
01:41:02,536 --> 01:41:06,077
Or your own number.
Not the prison's, so that we'd find out.

1363
01:41:09,661 --> 01:41:13,661
I swear on my child's life
that I never calculated any of that.

1364
01:41:15,536 --> 01:41:17,285
What do you expect from us now?

1365
01:41:18,160 --> 01:41:20,577
Mr. Taheri should come to the charity

1366
01:41:21,994 --> 01:41:27,244
and tell them I'd already said
that someone else gave me the bag.

1367
01:41:27,327 --> 01:41:29,827
-Why not tell them yourself?
-I did.

1368
01:41:30,577 --> 01:41:31,910
They don't believe me.

1369
01:41:31,994 --> 01:41:34,661
There's already this rumor

1370
01:41:34,744 --> 01:41:37,327
that the prison authorities
made up your story.

1371
01:41:37,411 --> 01:41:40,577
All we need now
is for me to tell the charity

1372
01:41:40,661 --> 01:41:42,536
that someone else found it.

1373
01:41:42,619 --> 01:41:44,327
When does your leave end?

1374
01:41:45,327 --> 01:41:46,910
It's my last day.

1375
01:41:46,994 --> 01:41:48,994
Go give the checks to your creditor.

1376
01:41:49,077 --> 01:41:52,827
Ask him to forgive you,
on your knees, if necessary.

1377
01:41:52,910 --> 01:41:55,577
Stay there until he deletes the video.

1378
01:41:55,703 --> 01:41:59,661
Tomorrow, come back to prison
and lie low until it's forgotten.

1379
01:41:59,785 --> 01:42:01,452
Why should it be forgotten?

1380
01:42:02,119 --> 01:42:03,910
I gave the gold back.

1381
01:42:03,994 --> 01:42:08,035
You said you didn't
expect people to find out.

1382
01:42:08,119 --> 01:42:10,868
Imagine you did it and no one found out.

1383
01:42:10,952 --> 01:42:14,202
That's different.
They're saying I lied. I didn't.

1384
01:42:14,327 --> 01:42:15,868
But you didn't tell the truth.

1385
01:42:16,411 --> 01:42:19,160
You're either very smart or very simple.

1386
01:42:20,285 --> 01:42:22,577
If I was smart, why would I be in jail?

1387
01:42:23,119 --> 01:42:26,411
Now, go. Go and don't do anything.

1388
01:42:26,910 --> 01:42:27,744
No.

1389
01:42:28,452 --> 01:42:32,202
I'll convince my creditor
not to share the video.

1390
01:42:32,827 --> 01:42:36,494
But first, you go to the charity
and the council and tell them

1391
01:42:36,577 --> 01:42:38,952
I told you I didn't find the bag.

1392
01:42:39,327 --> 01:42:41,244
You're imposing conditions on us?

1393
01:42:41,327 --> 01:42:45,160
If he shares it, you'll be in trouble too.

1394
01:42:46,452 --> 01:42:50,703
Call the newspaper
and retract the whole story from our side.

1395
01:42:51,285 --> 01:42:53,327
Say he tricked us too.

1396
01:43:03,536 --> 01:43:04,577
Call him back.

1397
01:43:11,868 --> 01:43:13,077
Come here.

1398
01:43:19,577 --> 01:43:21,369
What's this slamming the door?

1399
01:43:30,785 --> 01:43:31,744
Sorry.

1400
01:45:05,494 --> 01:45:08,160
-Hello.
-Hello.

1401
01:45:08,244 --> 01:45:09,994
-Is Ms. Radmehr here?
-Yes.

1402
01:45:10,077 --> 01:45:12,536
Sit down please,
I'll let her know you're here.

1403
01:45:13,868 --> 01:45:15,494
Sit there.

1404
01:45:31,077 --> 01:45:34,494
-Yes?
-Ms. Radmehr, Mr. Soltani's here.

1405
01:45:36,452 --> 01:45:39,661
-You can go, I'll let you know.
-Thank you very much.

1406
01:45:39,744 --> 01:45:42,160
-Very kind of you.
-My pleasure.

1407
01:45:42,244 --> 01:45:43,952
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

1408
01:45:47,202 --> 01:45:49,452
Please sit down. I'll call you.

1409
01:45:49,536 --> 01:45:50,868
Come in, please.

1410
01:46:03,077 --> 01:46:05,577
-Mom, let's go.
-Wait a minute.

1411
01:46:05,661 --> 01:46:08,661
I did text my creditor a couple of times

1412
01:46:08,744 --> 01:46:11,827
from my cellmates' phones,
but he didn't reply.

1413
01:46:12,494 --> 01:46:14,785
The text he forwarded to the council...

1414
01:46:14,910 --> 01:46:16,703
He didn't.

1415
01:46:16,785 --> 01:46:19,452
-I only sent it to him.
-Anyway...

1416
01:46:19,577 --> 01:46:21,536
-Then I told him...
-Wait.

1417
01:46:24,244 --> 01:46:25,910
One of the inmates did?

1418
01:46:25,994 --> 01:46:27,744
What difference does it make?

1419
01:46:28,661 --> 01:46:33,494
I didn't agree with giving it back.
He really insisted on doing it.

1420
01:46:34,910 --> 01:46:37,327
I'm telling you the whole truth.

1421
01:46:37,827 --> 01:46:41,785
I swear it on the life of this man
who's my only joy in life.

1422
01:46:45,244 --> 01:46:48,077
You have no way of finding that lady?

1423
01:46:48,160 --> 01:46:53,952
I went to her neighborhood
yesterday with her picture

1424
01:46:54,703 --> 01:46:57,369
and showed it to all the shopkeepers.

1425
01:46:57,494 --> 01:46:58,868
Nobody knows her.

1426
01:46:58,994 --> 01:47:00,619
I don't know what to do.

1427
01:47:00,703 --> 01:47:03,952
I have you on one side
and that young lady on the other.

1428
01:47:04,994 --> 01:47:08,452
Ever since she heard your story,
she's come every day.

1429
01:47:08,536 --> 01:47:10,369
She's as needy as you are.

1430
01:47:10,452 --> 01:47:14,285
If we don't pay the recompense,
her husband will be hanged.

1431
01:47:17,202 --> 01:47:20,494
Put yourself in my shoes.
What should I do?

1432
01:47:26,077 --> 01:47:31,160
You can organize an evening
and raise funds for her husband.

1433
01:47:31,244 --> 01:47:34,785
We did and raised some money,

1434
01:47:34,868 --> 01:47:37,744
but not much,
as there's a murder involved.

1435
01:47:39,119 --> 01:47:43,827
If I give you the money,
and the kid's father gets hanged,

1436
01:47:43,910 --> 01:47:49,327
won't I be blamed for helping someone
in such an unclear situation?

1437
01:47:49,411 --> 01:47:52,411
Won't I be held responsible for his death?

1438
01:47:52,494 --> 01:47:54,994
You collected this money for him.

1439
01:47:55,077 --> 01:47:59,827
But the donors are calling to say
they don't want you to have the money.

1440
01:47:59,910 --> 01:48:02,327
If the video's shared, it'll be worse.

1441
01:48:06,035 --> 01:48:07,827
I don't care about this money.

1442
01:48:10,994 --> 01:48:12,744
I care about my honor.

1443
01:48:15,160 --> 01:48:19,119
Agree for us to give her the money
and save her husband.

1444
01:48:19,202 --> 01:48:24,619
I'll go to your creditor today,
and beg him not to share the video.

1445
01:48:24,703 --> 01:48:25,577
I promise.

1446
01:48:28,577 --> 01:48:30,077
Go in, Ms. Fathi.

1447
01:48:59,785 --> 01:49:03,536
-Go to the car, I'll come in a second.
-What?

1448
01:49:04,868 --> 01:49:07,494
-I won't be long.
-Where are you going?

1449
01:49:16,827 --> 01:49:18,035
Wait here.

1450
01:49:19,035 --> 01:49:20,744
-Raheleh...
-Come on.

1451
01:49:20,868 --> 01:49:21,994
Come on.

1452
01:49:22,577 --> 01:49:24,244
You saved my life.

1453
01:49:24,327 --> 01:49:25,994
Don't say that.

1454
01:49:26,077 --> 01:49:28,244
My child and I owe you our lives.

1455
01:49:28,327 --> 01:49:31,910
-I don't know how to thank you.
-No need. It's my duty.

1456
01:49:32,744 --> 01:49:34,202
Come on.

1457
01:49:34,285 --> 01:49:37,994
Thank you so much. You did so much for us.

1458
01:49:42,827 --> 01:49:45,244
Call your husband to share the good news.

1459
01:49:57,369 --> 01:50:02,744
If word spreads that you gave his money
to someone else,

1460
01:50:02,827 --> 01:50:04,994
it'll bring more shame on him.

1461
01:50:05,077 --> 01:50:08,202
We can't give him the money in any case.

1462
01:50:08,285 --> 01:50:09,244
Okay, fine.

1463
01:50:10,035 --> 01:50:13,827
I just wanted to beg you
to spread the word

1464
01:50:13,910 --> 01:50:16,868
that it was his idea

1465
01:50:16,952 --> 01:50:19,827
to give the money that was raised for him

1466
01:50:19,910 --> 01:50:23,244
to a needy convict
to save him from execution.

1467
01:50:23,327 --> 01:50:24,703
Can you do that?

1468
01:50:26,910 --> 01:50:30,285
Now that you're giving the money
to someone else,

1469
01:50:30,369 --> 01:50:34,160
at least let him take the credit
and not be disgraced further.

1470
01:50:35,369 --> 01:50:36,577
Please.

1471
01:50:38,952 --> 01:50:40,202
Okay.

1472
01:50:41,661 --> 01:50:45,703
I'll ask for the news to be put out
on social media today.

1473
01:51:03,703 --> 01:51:06,119
What's happened? What's wrong?

1474
01:51:07,452 --> 01:51:08,994
The video was shared.

1475
01:51:09,827 --> 01:51:13,202
-No! When?
-Right now.

1476
01:51:15,035 --> 01:51:18,160
-Who told you?
-Hossein called.

1477
01:51:27,244 --> 01:51:29,244
What are you going to do now?

1478
01:51:51,035 --> 01:51:53,411
-Hi, Auntie.
-Hi, darling.

1479
01:51:57,285 --> 01:51:58,160
Hello.

1480
01:51:58,244 --> 01:51:59,994
-Hello.
-Hello.

1481
01:52:24,494 --> 01:52:25,619
What got into him?

1482
01:52:26,411 --> 01:52:27,577
-Who?
-Rahim.

1483
01:52:27,661 --> 01:52:29,327
Haven't you seen the video?

1484
01:52:30,035 --> 01:52:33,785
-Stop seeing this guy immediately.
-What guy?

1485
01:52:33,910 --> 01:52:37,035
The charlatan with whom
you started this swindle!

1486
01:52:37,119 --> 01:52:39,119
Why are you shouting?

1487
01:52:39,202 --> 01:52:41,077
Because it falls on deaf ears!

1488
01:52:41,160 --> 01:52:42,703
Providing me with a roof

1489
01:52:42,785 --> 01:52:45,536
doesn't allow you
to speak to me however you like.

1490
01:52:45,619 --> 01:52:49,910
Didn't I ask you to leave this jerk?
Did it have to end like this?

1491
01:52:49,994 --> 01:52:52,536
-Like what?
-"Like what"?

1492
01:52:52,619 --> 01:52:56,577
Aren't you two ashamed?
How can one be such a rogue?

1493
01:53:00,369 --> 01:53:05,536
Who's this scumbag you disgrace
yourself and your family for?

1494
01:53:05,619 --> 01:53:07,994
This scumbag means everything to me.

1495
01:53:09,119 --> 01:53:10,785
I'd die for him.

1496
01:53:13,160 --> 01:53:15,452
Don't you talk to me like that again!

1497
01:53:30,202 --> 01:53:32,868
In the Name of God. Hello, dear listeners!

1498
01:53:46,744 --> 01:53:47,910
Hello, Rahim.

1499
01:53:50,369 --> 01:53:51,868
Can you get in the car?

1500
01:53:56,411 --> 01:53:57,244
How are you?

1501
01:54:00,577 --> 01:54:02,244
Salehpour is very angry with you.

1502
01:54:02,327 --> 01:54:05,452
When he heard the news, he calmed down.

1503
01:54:06,868 --> 01:54:07,785
What news?

1504
01:54:07,868 --> 01:54:10,244
That you offered the money to a convict.

1505
01:54:10,494 --> 01:54:13,452
-Who said that?
-The charity announced it.

1506
01:54:13,910 --> 01:54:15,868
That's a nice gesture, well done.

1507
01:54:17,744 --> 01:54:21,411
-I have a favor to ask you.
-What?

1508
01:54:21,494 --> 01:54:25,327
Let me make a video of you
and share it today.

1509
01:54:28,035 --> 01:54:29,994
-Saying what?
-What you did.

1510
01:54:30,785 --> 01:54:33,369
That you decided to hand the money over.

1511
01:54:34,619 --> 01:54:36,077
No, I didn't.

1512
01:54:36,994 --> 01:54:40,327
Between the video that was shared
and the rumors,

1513
01:54:40,411 --> 01:54:43,202
we have to find a way
to avoid this disgrace.

1514
01:54:43,952 --> 01:54:45,077
What way?

1515
01:54:46,619 --> 01:54:48,244
Can I pop inside?

1516
01:54:56,703 --> 01:54:57,910
A few...

1517
01:54:58,619 --> 01:55:00,077
A few coins...

1518
01:55:01,952 --> 01:55:05,411
Coins were found...

1519
01:55:06,035 --> 01:55:09,703
The own... No.

1520
01:55:10,827 --> 01:55:13,661
That was found...

1521
01:55:14,785 --> 01:55:17,369
Gave back to the owner.

1522
01:55:18,035 --> 01:55:20,369
"He gave them to the owner.

1523
01:55:20,452 --> 01:55:25,827
"But he couldn't find her again
and they didn't believe him.

1524
01:55:25,910 --> 01:55:28,994
"They said my father was lying."

1525
01:55:29,077 --> 01:55:32,077
Okay? Can you try again?

1526
01:55:32,952 --> 01:55:34,369
Go ahead.

1527
01:55:35,827 --> 01:55:37,327
Hello...

1528
01:55:38,785 --> 01:55:40,077
I'm...

1529
01:55:40,202 --> 01:55:42,744
Soltani.

1530
01:55:47,202 --> 01:55:50,952
The son...

1531
01:55:52,285 --> 01:55:56,160
of Rahim...

1532
01:55:59,244 --> 01:56:00,703
Sol...

1533
01:56:04,035 --> 01:56:05,619
...tani...

1534
01:56:05,703 --> 01:56:08,411
It didn't work, son. Once more.

1535
01:56:09,327 --> 01:56:10,369
It was fine.

1536
01:56:10,452 --> 01:56:15,244
No. Have some tea
and we'll rehearse a bit.

1537
01:56:15,369 --> 01:56:17,327
Not at all. It's better like this.

1538
01:56:17,411 --> 01:56:19,744
When he's stressed, he can't speak.

1539
01:56:19,827 --> 01:56:22,952
-Come on, son.
-No, sit down.

1540
01:56:23,785 --> 01:56:27,744
The way he's speaking is more convincing.

1541
01:56:28,119 --> 01:56:29,827
Speak the same way.

1542
01:56:32,452 --> 01:56:33,619
Go ahead.

1543
01:56:35,661 --> 01:56:38,160
-Hello...
-Wait.

1544
01:56:38,952 --> 01:56:41,035
If you see your dad going to jail,

1545
01:56:41,119 --> 01:56:43,327
you should look sadder. Don't you think?

1546
01:56:43,411 --> 01:56:45,868
Don't you love your dad?

1547
01:56:46,785 --> 01:56:48,785
So, why aren't you sad?

1548
01:56:48,868 --> 01:56:51,744
You look like you're happy to let him go.

1549
01:56:53,119 --> 01:56:54,411
Start again.

1550
01:56:55,035 --> 01:56:57,202
Hello. I'm...

1551
01:56:58,785 --> 01:57:02,827
Siavash Soltan...

1552
01:57:04,119 --> 01:57:05,119
Tani...

1553
01:57:06,285 --> 01:57:08,785
The son...

1554
01:57:11,494 --> 01:57:12,868
Of...

1555
01:57:22,411 --> 01:57:23,494
What's up?

1556
01:57:25,119 --> 01:57:28,244
I don't want this to be shared.

1557
01:57:28,703 --> 01:57:33,077
Believe me, when he was speaking,
I nearly cried.

1558
01:57:33,160 --> 01:57:35,411
Whoever sees it will be overwhelmed.

1559
01:57:36,785 --> 01:57:39,577
I don't want my son to be seen like that.

1560
01:57:39,661 --> 01:57:44,868
It's to your advantage and his.
People will be on your side.

1561
01:57:44,952 --> 01:57:47,785
Even that woman may see it and call you.

1562
01:57:48,577 --> 01:57:50,952
-No, delete it.
-Think for a bit.

1563
01:57:51,827 --> 01:57:54,452
-The kid said nothing bad.
-I don't want...

1564
01:57:54,536 --> 01:57:57,202
You think it's only about what you want?

1565
01:57:57,285 --> 01:58:00,160
All our reputation is at stake.

1566
01:58:00,244 --> 01:58:02,952
You want it back through my son's stutter?

1567
01:58:12,952 --> 01:58:15,119
Please stay with us, Mr. Taheri.

1568
01:58:15,202 --> 01:58:17,285
It's very kind of you.

1569
01:58:19,952 --> 01:58:21,119
Rahim!

1570
01:58:21,202 --> 01:58:23,744
-What are you doing?
-Delete it.

1571
01:58:23,827 --> 01:58:25,661
-Move!

01:59:00,285 --> 01:59:01,494
Rahim.

Okay, stop shouting!

1592
01:59:13,744 --> 01:59:17,536
Are you out of your mind?
