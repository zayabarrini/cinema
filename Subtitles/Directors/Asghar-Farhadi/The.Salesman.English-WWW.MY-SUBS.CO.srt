Alexandre Mallet-Guy
Asghar Farhadi

5
00:02:50,254 --> 00:02:51,671
Get out!

6
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:54,048
The building's collapsing!

7
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:08,354
What's happening?

8
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:10,064
What are you doing there?

9
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:16,153
We have to evacuate!

10
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:22,493
Rana!

11
00:03:22,578 --> 00:03:23,911
Hurry up.

12
00:03:30,294 --> 00:03:34,088
- What is it?
- No idea. We have to evacuate.

13
00:03:34,673 --> 00:03:35,798
Rana!

14
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,676
Quick!

15
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:41,178
Go down! Hurry up.

16
00:03:48,312 --> 00:03:50,479
- What's up?
- No idea.

17
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:54,942
Emad! I need help for my son!

18
00:03:55,027 --> 00:03:56,193
Coming.

19
00:03:56,278 --> 00:03:58,237
Put that on and go down.

20
00:03:58,322 --> 00:04:01,741
- I'll come up with you.
- No, get out.

21
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:03,451
Everyone, in the street!

22
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:05,870
Where's Hossein?

23
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,872
He won't listen to me.

24
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:12,001
Hossein...

25
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:18,758
Get up, son.
Get up, the building's collapsing.

26
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:20,176
Get up, Hossein.

27
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,554
Emad, come down!

28
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:26,974
Get out! Get everybody out.

29
00:04:27,059 --> 00:04:29,685
We have to evacuate the building.

30
00:04:31,355 --> 00:04:32,855
What are they doing?

31
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:37,526
My glasses.

32
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:40,696
I'll take them.

Asghar Farhadi

35
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,484
Hey, guys,

36
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,403
don't load yourselves down.

37
00:05:21,697 --> 00:05:23,280
We've got all you need.

38
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:24,448
Okay.

39
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,078
I can't find it.

40
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:30,454
Look hard.

41
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,580
I'll take this?

42
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:32,665
Yes, please.

43
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:36,585
- Only your toothbrushes, remember...
- Got them.

44
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:43,009
- Did you lock the car?
- Yes.

45
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,970
Give me the keys.

46
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:50,307
Hey, guys.

47
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:54,937
Hi.

48
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:57,106
Still alive, then?

49
00:05:57,649 --> 00:06:01,902
I thought we'd have
to dig you out of the rubble.

50
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:05,281
Look at that!

51
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,867
It smells like gas.

52
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:10,244
Since last night.

53
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:12,538
We shouldn't hang around.

54
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,461
- Shalom.
- Shalom.

55
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:22,173
- Why did you come up?
- Cut the electricity. There's a leak.

56
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:34,185
I can't find the card.

57
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:37,438
Did you look through the papers?

58
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:40,107
Not there, it's dangerous.

59
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:42,735
Jeez!

60
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:50,868
"One could only hear the sobs
of the woman sitting with her lamp

61
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,120
"on the barn roof,

62
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:56,040
"and inside, the lowing of a cow. "

63
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:58,542
Sir, is it a true story?

64
00:06:58,627 --> 00:07:03,339
Not really.
But in Saedi's writing,

65
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,592
the atmosphere and
characters are realistic,

66
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,344
very close to reality.

67
00:07:08,512 --> 00:07:10,387
A man turning into a cow?

68
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:11,806
Look in the mirror!

69
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:14,016
You're hilarious.

70
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:17,686
How can you turn into a cow?

71
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,190
Gradually.

72
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,443
Sir, can we see the film?

73
00:07:24,528 --> 00:07:27,154
Good idea. I'll bring it next time.

74
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:30,616
- Yes? - When can we
come to your play?

75
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,828
We open next week.

76
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:36,497
- I'll invite you soon.
- Thanks.

77
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:39,291
- What's it called?
- Death of a Salesman. Who's read it?

78
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:40,626
Nobody!

79
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:43,921
Seriously, anybody read it?

80
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:46,340
Who wrote it?

81
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:47,842
Arthur Miller.

82
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:49,135
I haven't read that one.

83
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:51,303
Good.

84
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:52,471
Excuse me.

85
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:55,391
Yes?

86
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:57,143
Hello.

87
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:03,357
I can't talk. I'm in class.

88
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:06,152
Can you call me in 10 minutes?

89
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:08,946
Stick shift, yes.

90
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,240
Silver, that's right.

91
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:13,742
You're welcome.

92
00:08:14,286 --> 00:08:15,744
He's selling his car.

93
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:17,663
Who do you play, sir?

94
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:18,956
The salesman.

95
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:20,583
What do you sell?

96
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:21,917
Potatoes!

97
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:23,836
You'll see.

98
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:25,671
What model is it?

99
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,339
- What?
- Your car.

100
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:28,382
Why?

101
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:30,426
Are you selling it or not?

102
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:34,388
His father works in the traffic office.
He can cancel your tickets!

103
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:35,931
You never get tickets!

104
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,643
Why do Iranians say "BMV" for "BMW"?

105
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:42,354
Pardon?

106
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:45,024
Why do Iranians say "BMV" for "BMW"?

107
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:49,778
Calm down.

108
00:08:50,614 --> 00:08:51,947
Eh, eh, eh.

109
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:54,533
No harm in asking questions.

110
00:08:54,618 --> 00:08:55,618
I don't know the answer.

111
00:08:58,538 --> 00:08:59,538
So,

112
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,208
for next time...

113
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:05,044
...write a summary of the novel.

114
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:07,004
And no lame excuses,

115
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:09,840
like sleeping in or family gatherings.

116
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,813
Would you mind not spreading out?

117
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,953
Can I switch places with the young man?

118
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,109
- Dad?
- Hmm?

119
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:11,819
Somebody in there?

120
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:16,323
No, that was next door.

121
00:10:16,408 --> 00:10:18,784
Somebody got in your bathroom.

122
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,452
No.

123
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:23,831
It's the next room, there's a party.

124
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:25,416
Can I come in?

125
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:30,004
There's something in the bathtub, Willy.
It's moving.

126
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:36,093
Miss Francis,

127
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:39,388
you better go back to your room.

128
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:42,474
I've got to get dressed. I can't.

129
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,518
Yes, you can. Go back.

130
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:47,813
Biff, this is Miss Francis,
my neighbor.

131
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:52,151
They're painting her room.

132
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:55,321
She asked if she could take a shower here.

133
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:57,281
I let her.

134
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:59,199
Go back.

135
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:00,951
But I'm not dressed.

136
00:11:01,036 --> 00:11:03,954
Please, get out of here.

137
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:05,873
You promised me stockings.

138
00:11:05,957 --> 00:11:07,416
I don't have any here.

139
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,337
You had two boxes of size 9 for me,
and I want them.

140
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:12,713
Go on, take them.

141
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:15,591
For God's sake, will you get out?

142
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:16,925
Get out.

143
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:33,108
I hope there's nobody.

144
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:34,818
Going out naked...

145
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:38,238
Uh...

146
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:41,200
Say,

147
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:42,659
are you

148
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,496
football or...

149
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:48,582
Shut up!

150
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:50,918
Siavash!

151
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:52,461
What's up, Mommy?

152
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:54,213
It's worse and worse.

153
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:55,506
Sadra, we're off.

154
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:57,716
Sanam, forget it.

155
00:11:57,884 --> 00:12:01,428
Just because I'm playing a hooker,
he thinks he can disrespect me.

156
00:12:02,097 --> 00:12:03,764
You're making fun of me!

157
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:05,599
Shut it!

158
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:07,351
Leave her alone.

159
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:09,978
Come on, it's the final rehearsal.

160
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:12,689
Sorry, I'm sorry.

161
00:12:13,108 --> 00:12:17,694
I drag my kid across the city
every night in the cold for this.

162
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:20,781
It's a pleasure working with you.

163
00:12:24,536 --> 00:12:26,036
Leave him!

164
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:28,622
Sanam, stop it.

165
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,457
Leave him, I said!

166
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:31,959
I was kidding.

167
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:36,171
It was a joke.

168
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:40,717
She comes in, in her raincoat

169
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:43,846
and says, "I can't go out without clothes. "

170
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,100
"I can't... "

171
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:49,351
It's funny.

172
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:51,770
Go and get her. She's going to quit.

173
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:55,107
Oh, no, don't send me out naked.

174
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:58,235
I can't go out like that.

175
00:12:58,319 --> 00:12:59,319
Sanam!

176
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,155
What an idiot!

177
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,459
You find anything?

178
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:17,963
650 square feet, 3rd floor walkup, 40,000.

179
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:19,840
- Where?
- Amir Atabak.

180
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:22,426
- What're you looking for?
- Temporary.

181
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,928
Otherwise, we'll be sleeping here.

182
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,099
You free tomorrow?

183
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:32,186
- Why?
- I've got something to show you.

184
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:34,897
Okay, let's do a complete run-through.

185
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:40,777
You okay?

186
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,865
What are you doing here?

187
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:48,535
Kitty...

188
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:55,959
Whose is he?

189
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:04,593
It's nice here.

190
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:36,500
- Babak?
- Hmm?

191
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,919
Is this a closet?

192
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:41,463
Where?

193
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:43,048
Not at all.

194
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:44,675
It's the other bedroom.

195
00:14:44,968 --> 00:14:45,968
Eh?

196
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:48,679
- Too small?
- It's two bedrooms.

197
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:49,846
Will it do?

198
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:52,391
More than enough for two people.

199
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:54,351
Careful what you say.

200
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:57,187
There might be three of us soon.

201
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:59,356
Rana, is he serious?

202
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:00,816
No.

203
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:03,318
- Wouldn't think so.
- Why?

204
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:05,487
Is it locked?

205
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:08,323
The last tenant left her stuff here.

206
00:15:10,702 --> 00:15:12,661
Don't be scared, kitty.

207
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:22,004
- How long has it been empty?
- Three weeks.

208
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:24,047
Oh!

209
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,472
What a disaster, this town.

210
00:15:34,017 --> 00:15:37,519
If we could only level it
all and start again.

211
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:41,064
They did, and look at the result.

212
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,108
- Good old Willy.
- Babak!

213
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:45,319
God save us, Charley.

214
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:49,323
- When will the room be free?
- Very soon, she promised.

215
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:02,210
There's no parking space.
You'll have to park outside.

216
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:03,712
We'll do without.

217
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:06,006
We're selling the car to pay the deposit.

218
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,300
- Who said anything about money?
- Even so.

219
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:10,177
Hello, Mr. Salimi.

220
00:16:10,261 --> 00:16:12,888
Mr. Shahnazari, the best neighbor ever.

221
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:15,140
How are you?

222
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:18,435
Pleased to meet you.

223
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:21,021
Babak, where's the cellar?

224
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:22,648
Over there.

225
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:29,029
- Mr. Salimi?
- Yes?

226
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:31,365
It's open.

227
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:37,329
Careful who you take in this time.

228
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:40,123
- I know them.
- Last time, too.

229
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:41,708
Don't worry.

230
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:44,836
- What do they do?
- They're in the arts.

231
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:45,962
All the better.

232
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:48,006
It's okay for a few months,

233
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:50,384
but we have to pay,

234
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:53,387
I don't want him to do us a favor.

235
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:56,932
For once, it looks like we're in luck.

236
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:04,898
Go up carefully.

237
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:07,901
- You need a hand?
- Go and get the rest.

238
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:20,455
Careful with the ceiling light.

239
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,710
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

240
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:30,382
- She kept the key?
- Of this room, yes.

241
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:35,470
Easy does it.

242
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:39,141
Where's Ali?

243
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:43,228
Put that down.

244
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:51,528
Ali...

245
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:54,614
Leave it. I'll call an electrician tomorrow.

246
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:57,242
- It's okay, I can do it.
- Leave it.

247
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:01,121
She could've said.

248
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:05,792
She seemed so sure she'd come by.

249
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:08,712
I didn't think she'd let us down.

250
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:13,967
- What does she say now?
- Nothing. She doesn't answer.

251
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:16,261
Try with another phone.

252
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:18,054
Rana, your phone.

253
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:24,603
We really need the room for our furniture.

254
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:29,566
That's right.

255
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:32,736
Okay.

256
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,447
He's here. Can I put him on?

257
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:42,329
Okay.

258
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,875
Seems she already told you everything.

259
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,251
So?

260
00:18:48,753 --> 00:18:53,340
She was meant to sign a lease yesterday.
The landlord stood her up.

261
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:56,676
She's looking for somewhere else
before coming for this.

262
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:02,808
She doesn't want you to touch her things.

263
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:09,105
Or speak to her.

264
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:11,316
So?

265
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,734
Nothing.

266
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:13,860
I'm coming, Kati.

267
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:18,240
- Ali!
- Ali.

268
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:20,283
You got a screwdriver?

269
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:30,919
What a mess!

270
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,046
I expected only a couple of things.

271
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,966
- Sure this is okay?
- I'll take responsibility.

272
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:38,051
We'll make room in the corridor.

273
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:40,178
- Where?
- On the left.

274
00:19:41,222 --> 00:19:42,681
Clear all that.

275
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:44,391
Put that on the other side.

276
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:49,604
Rana?

277
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:53,191
There's lots of personal belongings.

278
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,944
Those are her clothes...

279
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:59,948
She's been giving us the runaround.

280
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,116
What if she complains?

281
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,828
She should've kept her word.
Let's get rid of it.

282
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:07,998
I'm not taking anything heavy.
I'm performing this evening.

283
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,517
Come and eat.

284
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,231
Rana.

285
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:37,986
Could you plug that in?

286
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:40,882
Go get the boxes.

287
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:42,467
Hello, everyone.

288
00:21:42,969 --> 00:21:44,386
Is it the cash for the car?

289
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:47,055
Leave it at the office
and call the librarian.

290
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:51,476
Learn the poem by heart for next time.

291
00:21:54,939 --> 00:21:56,231
Goodbye, sir.

292
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:30,724
Thank you, sir.

293
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:32,684
Goodbye.

294
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:36,813
- Can I speak to you, sir?
- Sure.

295
00:22:37,148 --> 00:22:39,816
I was very upset the other day.

296
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:41,359
What day?

297
00:22:41,444 --> 00:22:44,446
The day that woman accused you in the taxi.

298
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:48,366
She accused me?

299
00:22:48,451 --> 00:22:52,245
She wanted to switch places with me.

300
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:57,333
When you got out,
I told her you were our teacher,

301
00:22:57,418 --> 00:23:00,545
and that we liked you a lot.

302
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:04,466
- What's your name again?
- Amin.

303
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:07,677
Amin, you can be sure

304
00:23:07,762 --> 00:23:12,348
that a man behaved badly
in a taxi to that woman, and now

305
00:23:12,433 --> 00:23:14,768
she thinks they're all the same.

306
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:18,480
But nobody died, so off you go.

307
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:20,565
- Goodbye, sir.
- Goodbye.

308
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:11,574
I don't know what to do with her.

309
00:24:12,118 --> 00:24:13,284
Who?

310
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:14,536
That woman.

311
00:24:15,121 --> 00:24:20,250
I called her and she got on her high horse
and threatened me.

312
00:24:20,334 --> 00:24:21,376
With what?

313
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:25,338
"Don't touch my personal things.
I'll sue you. "

314
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:29,050
I spent the night trying
to protect her things from the rain.

315
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:31,010
Her problem's different.

316
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:33,346
You mean the woman?

317
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:35,682
When's she coming?

318
00:24:35,766 --> 00:24:37,809
When she's found a place.

319
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,731
Sadra, come and see Mommy.

320
00:24:46,694 --> 00:24:50,029
Hurry up. The doors open in five minutes.

321
00:24:54,285 --> 00:24:55,326
Emad.

322
00:24:58,289 --> 00:25:00,748
They're coming back after the performance.

323
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:04,752
Three passages might still be censored.

324
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:06,796
Can you stay and talk to them?

325
00:25:06,881 --> 00:25:08,965
- Tonight?
- Yes.

326
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:10,258
If it'll help...

327
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:12,635
Otherwise, the show risks a suspension.

328
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,971
- How many passages?
- Three.

329
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:16,598
I won't stay.

330
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:17,891
Won't you wait for me?

331
00:25:17,975 --> 00:25:20,393
No, it'll last till midnight.

332
00:25:20,728 --> 00:25:22,103
Take the car.

333
00:25:22,188 --> 00:25:25,023
- Where's the apartment key?
- In my pocket.

334
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:27,442
- Have a good show, honey.
- You, too.

335
00:27:11,714 --> 00:27:15,883
Will you get us something
for breakfast from the supermarket?

336
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:21,431
If it's open, I said.

337
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:26,728
And liquid soap.

338
00:27:27,688 --> 00:27:29,689
I'll take a shower, meantime.

339
00:27:30,524 --> 00:27:34,610
I look horrible.
I haven't even removed my makeup.

340
00:27:37,448 --> 00:27:38,781
I'll be quick.

341
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:40,783
It won't take long.

342
00:27:42,328 --> 00:27:43,411
Love you.

343
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:44,912
See you later.

344
00:28:40,594 --> 00:28:42,387
- Anything else?
- No, thanks.

345
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:46,641
- By card?
- No, cash.

346
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,155
- Good evening, madam.
- Shalom.

347
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,908
I'm your upstairs neighbor.

348
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:07,453
We've just moved in. Could you let me in?

349
00:29:07,955 --> 00:29:08,955
Thanks.

350
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:28,307
Rana?

351
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:35,440
Rana.

352
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:08,723
Rana, what happened to you?

353
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,308
Please go out, sir.

354
00:30:10,392 --> 00:30:14,145
- Wait outside, we'll call you
for the scanner. - Rana...

355
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:15,480
Please stay outside.

356
00:30:15,564 --> 00:30:19,775
- Look at me.
- No worries. We'll call you.

357
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,360
Go on.

358
00:30:23,864 --> 00:30:28,075
You should change
the lock first thing tomorrow morning.

359
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:32,163
Did someone come into our place?

360
00:30:32,581 --> 00:30:34,749
I thought she'd fainted.

361
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,959
We don't know what happened.

362
00:30:37,044 --> 00:30:40,171
We heard cries from upstairs.

363
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:43,382
A whole series of cries.

364
00:30:44,051 --> 00:30:46,344
I told my husband to go and see.

365
00:30:46,428 --> 00:30:49,138
He thought it was a domestic fight.

366
00:30:49,223 --> 00:30:51,974
But then we heard running on the stairs,

367
00:30:52,059 --> 00:30:54,852
and I understood there was a problem.

368
00:30:54,937 --> 00:30:55,978
Who was it?

369
00:30:56,063 --> 00:30:59,649
By the time we got out,
he was already in the street.

370
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:02,944
His foot must be cut,
given the blood on the stairs.

371
00:31:03,028 --> 00:31:05,655
If I'd have caught him,
I'd have skinned him alive.

372
00:31:06,323 --> 00:31:09,659
We went up
and found your wife unconscious,

373
00:31:09,743 --> 00:31:12,703
blood on the floor, I dressed her.

374
00:31:12,788 --> 00:31:17,708
That's enough talk.
Thank God it wasn't anything more serious.

375
00:31:17,793 --> 00:31:22,046
Maybe you could go to the ER,

376
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:24,340
to see if there's any news.

377
00:31:26,802 --> 00:31:29,554
- Sorry...
- You don't look well.

378
00:31:29,638 --> 00:31:31,973
Sit down for a bit.

379
00:31:37,688 --> 00:31:40,106
Has anything been taken?

380
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,317
I didn't notice.

381
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:47,530
Why would a burglar go into the bathroom?

382
00:31:48,574 --> 00:31:49,574
Who was it, then?

383
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:51,826
A client of that woman.

384
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:54,078
What woman?

385
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:56,247
The one there before you.

386
00:31:57,374 --> 00:32:01,294
She lived a wild life.

387
00:32:01,378 --> 00:32:05,798
I think the guy came for her.

388
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:21,564
Don't close it, Ali's coming.

389
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:30,740
It's okay, go ahead.

390
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:39,206
Can you pull my sleeve?

391
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:43,377
Thanks.

392
00:32:50,427 --> 00:32:52,386
Wait, I'll take your scarf.

393
00:32:54,348 --> 00:32:56,807
- Do you want another pillow?
- No.

394
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:09,111
- Turn out the light.
- No, leave it.

395
00:33:10,614 --> 00:33:13,366
- Do you want anything?
- No, thanks.

396
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:23,584
Where are you going, Emad?

397
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:27,421
Where?

398
00:33:28,382 --> 00:33:31,092
Nowhere, I'm here. Do you want something?

399
00:33:32,761 --> 00:33:34,345
Leave the door open.

400
00:33:40,644 --> 00:33:44,522
If ever she feels faint, call me.

401
00:33:44,606 --> 00:33:45,648
Okay, thanks.

402
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:48,275
Watch her blood pressure.

403
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,944
- Thanks for everything.
- You're welcome.

404
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:53,280
- I'll make you breakfast.
- No, we're going.

405
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:55,449
- I insist.
- Forget it.

406
00:33:55,534 --> 00:33:57,535
You must be hungry.

407
00:33:58,662 --> 00:34:00,996
Why don't you stay with them?

408
00:34:01,081 --> 00:34:03,666
Would you like some soup?

409
00:34:05,419 --> 00:34:06,585
You sure?

410
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:09,588
You go and get some rest, too.

411
00:34:09,673 --> 00:34:12,550
- Call us if you need anything.
- Don't hesitate.

412
00:34:12,634 --> 00:34:14,552
- Okay.
- Bye, then.

413
00:34:14,636 --> 00:34:16,554
Thanks for everything.

414
00:34:17,514 --> 00:34:19,390
Here, this is yours.

415
00:34:20,142 --> 00:34:21,684
Kati, thanks.

416
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:27,184
Iron and aluminum doors,

417
00:36:27,269 --> 00:36:29,603
good price paid.

418
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:16,085
Come here, I want to go to the bathroom.

419
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:32,267
What are you doing?

420
00:38:32,352 --> 00:38:33,686
Leave it, I'll wash it.

421
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:35,771
Come, do it.

422
00:38:35,897 --> 00:38:37,356
Okay, cut the water.

423
00:38:41,236 --> 00:38:43,404
Come and clean, so I can go.

424
00:38:44,197 --> 00:38:46,156
Someone may come to inspect.

425
00:38:51,121 --> 00:38:52,121
Yes?

426
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,165
Okay, sorry.

427
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:56,291
Who is it?

428
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:58,210
The neighbor.

429
00:38:58,294 --> 00:38:59,712
- What does he want?
- I'll be back.

430
00:39:06,553 --> 00:39:07,678
Sorry.

431
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:24,028
I'm sorry for the trouble last night.

432
00:39:24,112 --> 00:39:25,612
Don't mention it.

433
00:39:25,697 --> 00:39:29,742
Call the police.
They'll find him, thanks to the pickup.

434
00:39:29,826 --> 00:39:32,953
I will. I'll find a place to park,
in the meantime.

435
00:39:33,038 --> 00:39:35,581
We thought we'd got rid of her.

436
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:39,043
Do you know who the pickup owner is?

437
00:39:39,127 --> 00:39:42,713
The woman had too many visitors.

438
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:45,632
I may ask you to testify,

439
00:39:45,717 --> 00:39:48,552
if a detective comes.

440
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:50,846
Sure. Do you want my number?

441
00:39:51,181 --> 00:39:53,390
- Yes, please.
- I'm off.

442
00:39:53,475 --> 00:39:54,683
Thanks again, madam.

443
00:39:54,768 --> 00:39:59,605
You're welcome. Those people
deserve to be publicly humiliated.

444
00:39:59,689 --> 00:40:01,774
It's 912...

445
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:23,003
What are you doing out here?
Go inside.

446
00:40:23,088 --> 00:40:24,546
I'm scared on my own.

447
00:40:26,633 --> 00:40:27,800
Where were you?

448
00:40:29,761 --> 00:40:32,763
I went to thank the
neighbors for last night.

449
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:35,099
- What did they say?
- Nothing.

450
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:37,518
They asked after you.

451
00:40:37,811 --> 00:40:41,522
You didn't tell the troupe, I hope?

452
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:42,648
No.

453
00:40:43,608 --> 00:40:45,192
I'm going to the police.

454
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:48,278
We have to lodge a complaint
so they'll find him.

455
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:50,989
How will they do it?

456
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:53,826
He left his pickup.

457
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:57,538
He also forgot his phone,
but the line's cut.

458
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:01,375
Who was it?

459
00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:08,423
The neighbors say the old tenant
was promiscuous.

460
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:13,303
That jerk must have been a client of hers.

461
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:18,350
Do you remember his face?

462
00:41:19,227 --> 00:41:20,227
No.

463
00:41:20,937 --> 00:41:22,396
Didn't you see him?

464
00:41:31,823 --> 00:41:33,490
Come inside, it's cold.

465
00:41:47,547 --> 00:41:48,589
Let me serve you.

466
00:41:55,889 --> 00:41:57,264
Who got me out of the bathroom?

467
00:41:59,976 --> 00:42:01,310
A neighbor.

468
00:42:02,562 --> 00:42:03,770
Which one?

469
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:05,731
I have no idea. Who cares?

470
00:42:09,819 --> 00:42:13,197
Have your breakfast and go to sleep.

471
00:42:17,202 --> 00:42:20,829
I can't. As soon as I close my eyes,
I see it all again.

472
00:42:30,924 --> 00:42:32,257
How did he get in?

473
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:37,679
I let him in. I was waiting for you.

474
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:43,393
I came out of the bathroom,
buzzed the door open and went back in.

475
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:54,571
I was washing my hair.
I felt someone had come in.

476
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:59,868
He stroked my hair, I thought it was you.

477
00:43:01,496 --> 00:43:04,539
Then I saw his hands
and I can't remember anything else.

478
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:21,515
Rana.

479
00:43:22,517 --> 00:43:23,600
Darling,

480
00:43:23,685 --> 00:43:25,519
eat a little.

481
00:43:31,901 --> 00:43:33,068
My Rana.

482
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:36,029
My love.

483
00:44:34,714 --> 00:44:36,840
And tonight's performance?

484
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,551
I had it canceled.

485
00:44:40,053 --> 00:44:42,846
- Call to say I'm coming.
- In this state?

486
00:44:43,139 --> 00:44:44,556
I can't stay here.

487
00:44:51,564 --> 00:44:53,398
Let's go to the police.

488
00:44:53,483 --> 00:44:55,317
It could be a while.

489
00:44:55,818 --> 00:44:58,820
- No, let's not go.
- We can't do anything.

490
00:45:01,282 --> 00:45:06,078
I don't want to have to tell it
in front of everybody.

491
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:10,207
Did something happen?

492
00:45:11,292 --> 00:45:12,334
No.

493
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:15,504
Then say nothing. I'll do the talking.

494
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:18,090
- Come on.
- It's too hard for me.

495
00:45:29,185 --> 00:45:31,561
I'm not joking, Linda.

496
00:45:31,646 --> 00:45:34,940
I know it when I walk down the street.

497
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:39,069
They seem to laugh at me.

498
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:40,654
Why?

499
00:45:41,197 --> 00:45:44,282
Why would they laugh at you?

500
00:45:44,367 --> 00:45:47,494
They just pass me by.

501
00:45:48,371 --> 00:45:52,332
They ignore me. I'm not noticed.

502
00:45:58,464 --> 00:45:59,506
Linda!

503
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:11,935
How long are you going to keep
darning those socks?

504
00:46:12,979 --> 00:46:15,188
You know it drives me crazy!

505
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:18,900
Can't you stop while I'm talking to you?

506
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:28,577
Okay, let's talk about something else.

507
00:46:28,661 --> 00:46:31,204
Let's talk about my income.

508
00:46:32,373 --> 00:46:35,167
My income that never changes.

509
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:36,835
It's ridiculous.

510
00:46:37,462 --> 00:46:38,712
What's wrong?

511
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:41,131
Why don't you say something?

512
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:42,382
Willy,

513
00:46:43,134 --> 00:46:46,386
darling, you're the handsomest man
in the whole world.

514
00:46:50,725 --> 00:46:55,520
You always tell me that, Linda.
You tell me, but it doesn't help.

515
00:46:55,605 --> 00:46:57,939
I can never satisfy you,

516
00:46:58,107 --> 00:47:00,775
for I'm just a simple salesman.

517
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:03,069
I'm nothing, Linda.

518
00:47:03,154 --> 00:47:04,404
But I tried...

519
00:47:04,489 --> 00:47:06,781
Why are you crying?

520
00:47:11,329 --> 00:47:12,996
Wait, where are you going?

521
00:47:14,123 --> 00:47:15,665
Linda, come back.

522
00:47:21,088 --> 00:47:22,547
I'm sorry.

523
00:47:22,632 --> 00:47:25,008
We have to interrupt the play.

524
00:47:26,761 --> 00:47:28,803
My partner and wife is ill.

525
00:47:28,888 --> 00:47:32,432
We'd like a 10-minute break,
and we thank you.

526
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:37,687
Can you go on?

527
00:47:37,772 --> 00:47:40,190
You see she can't.

528
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:42,359
Find some way to cancel.

529
00:47:42,443 --> 00:47:45,403
Do you want to lie down next door?

530
00:47:45,488 --> 00:47:49,366
Come on, let's leave her to rest here.

531
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:52,827
Sanam.

532
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:54,996
Coming.

533
00:47:55,665 --> 00:47:57,749
Do you need anything?

534
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:04,673
Kati,

535
00:48:05,091 --> 00:48:07,050
go and announce it's canceled.

536
00:48:08,177 --> 00:48:10,095
What will I say?

537
00:48:17,937 --> 00:48:19,563
What happened to you?

538
00:48:23,943 --> 00:48:27,320
The gaze of one member
of the audience bothered me.

539
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:34,703
They've come here to look at you.

540
00:48:34,787 --> 00:48:36,871
He had the guy's gaze.

541
00:48:43,546 --> 00:48:45,255
You said you didn't see him.

542
00:48:45,423 --> 00:48:49,509
I'm not well at all. I need help.

543
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:54,264
Babak, can you come here?

544
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:55,390
Coming.

545
00:48:56,392 --> 00:48:57,684
We'll talk later.

546
00:49:05,151 --> 00:49:06,359
Is she better?

547
00:49:07,445 --> 00:49:10,113
I meant to say...

548
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:13,658
You didn't think to tell me
who lived there before us?

549
00:49:13,743 --> 00:49:16,119
- Why? - You're supposed
to be my friend.

550
00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:20,123
What happened?
What's it got to do with you?

551
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:23,335
The whole neighborhood
knows that apartment.

552
00:49:23,419 --> 00:49:24,794
Who said that?

553
00:49:24,879 --> 00:49:26,546
No one.

554
00:49:26,631 --> 00:49:29,049
Why doesn't she come for her stuff?

555
00:49:29,133 --> 00:49:30,967
But I wanted to help you.

556
00:49:31,052 --> 00:49:34,721
Did you forget you were about
to come and sleep here?

557
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:37,557
Was that a reason to hide who she was?

558
00:49:37,642 --> 00:49:39,225
What do you mean, "hide"?

559
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:41,936
Did you warn me?

560
00:49:42,021 --> 00:49:43,396
About what?

561
00:49:43,481 --> 00:49:48,401
Should I have repeated gossip
so you'd go there unwillingly?

562
00:49:49,111 --> 00:49:50,528
What happened?

563
00:49:50,613 --> 00:49:52,113
I'm going, Babak.

564
00:49:52,198 --> 00:49:53,281
Coming.

565
00:49:53,658 --> 00:49:56,618
Go and see Rana,
you'll know what happened.

566
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:59,287
They told me she slipped in the shower.

567
00:50:02,625 --> 00:50:05,251
We even spoke about having a child there,

568
00:50:05,336 --> 00:50:07,045
and you told us nothing.

569
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:09,798
You were joking.

570
00:50:10,383 --> 00:50:12,926
Otherwise, you'd have told us?

571
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:16,012
Told you what? What's got into you?

572
00:50:16,097 --> 00:50:18,848
Babak, put yourself in my shoes.

573
00:50:18,933 --> 00:50:22,727
Imagine how many men
have passed through our bedroom.

574
00:50:24,814 --> 00:50:26,773
Don't feel obligated.

575
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:29,401
I haven't cashed your check.

576
00:50:29,485 --> 00:50:34,781
Once you find a place with
a previous tenant to your liking, leave.

577
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:36,408
Do what you like.

578
00:50:47,753 --> 00:50:48,837
- Hello.
- Hello.

579
00:50:49,964 --> 00:50:51,506
Mrs. Shahnazari,

580
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:55,051
be careful not to slip on the stairs,
they're wet.

581
00:50:55,136 --> 00:50:58,888
In fact, I almost called the cleaner

582
00:50:58,973 --> 00:51:02,851
to tell him to come earlier this week.

583
00:51:02,935 --> 00:51:05,145
But I thought you'd go to the police,

584
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:07,689
and we had to leave the traces.

585
00:51:08,149 --> 00:51:10,024
Nothing serious happened.

586
00:51:10,359 --> 00:51:14,738
It's obvious you're not the one
who found your wife the other day,

587
00:51:14,822 --> 00:51:17,240
otherwise you wouldn't say that.

588
00:51:18,409 --> 00:51:21,703
When Mr. Alimoradi opened the door,

589
00:51:21,787 --> 00:51:25,540
he thought your wife had had it.

590
00:51:26,709 --> 00:51:28,293
Give her my regards.

591
00:51:34,675 --> 00:51:36,718
Get up, I took the bread out.

592
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:38,845
- I'm going.
- Wait.

593
00:51:44,977 --> 00:51:47,145
I'll get ready and come, too.

594
00:51:47,229 --> 00:51:49,022
Where? I'm going to school.

595
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:50,899
I'll stay in the car.

596
00:51:51,692 --> 00:51:53,526
It'll be a while.

597
00:51:53,611 --> 00:51:55,320
Then don't go.

598
00:51:55,404 --> 00:51:58,323
- What?
- Don't go today.

599
00:51:59,492 --> 00:52:03,787
And tomorrow? And the day after?
It's not a solution.

600
00:52:04,705 --> 00:52:06,748
I can't stay here alone.

601
00:52:08,501 --> 00:52:10,293
I don't want to be here alone.

602
00:52:12,046 --> 00:52:13,755
What can I do?

603
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:18,092
Do you want to go to your parents
for a few days?

604
00:52:19,804 --> 00:52:21,179
Looking like this?

605
00:52:22,848 --> 00:52:24,307
I decided this morning.

606
00:52:25,017 --> 00:52:28,770
Either we go to the police,
or we forget this whole story.

607
00:52:29,855 --> 00:52:33,399
Okay, let's forget it,
but we look for an apartment today.

608
00:52:33,484 --> 00:52:34,526
We'll go.

609
00:52:34,610 --> 00:52:36,945
But in the meantime, you should...

610
00:52:37,029 --> 00:52:39,113
You could pull yourself together.

611
00:52:39,198 --> 00:52:40,698
You think it's up to me?

612
00:52:40,783 --> 00:52:44,661
Yes, you could take your pills
and not ruminate all night long.

613
00:52:45,246 --> 00:52:47,372
Couldn't you? Go take a shower.

614
00:52:48,082 --> 00:52:50,333
I'll stand outside, come on.

615
00:52:51,418 --> 00:52:53,628
Not in that bathroom.

616
00:52:57,508 --> 00:53:01,761
- We'll go to a friend's, then.
- I show up for a shower?

617
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:04,722
What should I do, then?

618
00:53:06,767 --> 00:53:08,309
You blow hot and cold.

619
00:53:09,728 --> 00:53:13,648
At night, I can't come near.
During the day, it's, "Don't go. "

620
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:17,485
- Tell me what I should do.
- Go.

621
00:53:17,570 --> 00:53:19,654
We won't find a place right away.

622
00:53:19,738 --> 00:53:23,074
But you won't shower till then,
with your wound?

623
00:53:43,512 --> 00:53:44,929
Darling.

624
00:53:47,725 --> 00:53:50,393
Tell yourself it could've been worse.

625
00:53:51,103 --> 00:53:55,732
If you'd injured your eye,
or hit your head harder,

626
00:53:56,025 --> 00:53:58,067
what would I have done?

627
00:53:58,694 --> 00:54:00,862
I wish I had hit myself harder.

628
00:54:02,573 --> 00:54:04,866
Don't say that, honey.

629
00:54:23,719 --> 00:54:24,802
Move a bit.

630
00:55:07,513 --> 00:55:09,013
Good morning, Mr. Etesami.

631
00:55:21,902 --> 00:55:23,152
- Hello.
- Hello.

632
00:55:23,654 --> 00:55:24,654
How are you?

633
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:27,490
Mr. Yeganeh said
to give you back these books.

634
00:55:29,034 --> 00:55:30,326
Silence.

635
00:55:30,411 --> 00:55:31,995
What's so funny?

636
00:55:34,373 --> 00:55:35,373
Why?

637
00:55:35,457 --> 00:55:37,834
He says they're inappropriate
for the students.

638
00:55:37,918 --> 00:55:40,128
Silence! Hey!

639
00:55:42,798 --> 00:55:44,966
Mr. Yeganeh said that?

640
00:55:46,719 --> 00:55:48,219
Put them in the trash.

641
00:55:48,303 --> 00:55:51,097
- Why?
- Because.

642
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:04,819
- Your phone.
- I don't have one.

643
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:06,738
- Give it to me.
- I don't have one.

644
00:56:08,323 --> 00:56:09,866
Hold on, sir.

645
00:56:12,786 --> 00:56:13,786
Give it to me.

646
00:56:13,871 --> 00:56:16,247
- I didn't film you.
- I want to see.

647
00:56:16,331 --> 00:56:17,790
I deleted it.

648
00:56:17,875 --> 00:56:19,250
Give it to me.

649
00:56:21,545 --> 00:56:24,213
I've got personal photos.

650
00:56:24,298 --> 00:56:25,381
Hands off.

651
00:56:25,466 --> 00:56:26,799
It's not fair.

652
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:34,582
Mr. Etesami.

653
00:56:34,850 --> 00:56:36,768
It's private, sir.

654
00:56:37,144 --> 00:56:38,978
I deleted it, sir.

655
00:56:40,773 --> 00:56:43,107
I swear.

656
00:56:43,692 --> 00:56:47,403
Put it online.
It's better than your film.

657
00:56:47,488 --> 00:56:49,906
You be quiet, or you're out.

658
00:56:51,992 --> 00:56:53,826
- Forgive him.
- Silence.

659
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:57,205
I'm talking to him.

660
00:56:58,874 --> 00:56:59,916
I deleted it.

661
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:02,502
Please.

662
00:57:06,298 --> 00:57:09,801
Call your father
to come and see your photos.

663
00:57:12,346 --> 00:57:14,097
His father's dead, sir.

664
00:58:04,022 --> 00:58:05,189
Hello, Daddy.

665
00:58:05,274 --> 00:58:07,817
Did you buy me a surprise egg?

666
00:58:09,862 --> 00:58:11,779
Sorry, couldn't find the key.

667
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:12,864
No problem.

668
00:58:12,948 --> 00:58:15,366
To keep from bothering you each time,

669
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:18,369
you could leave it next to the boiler.

670
00:58:18,453 --> 00:58:21,497
I'll tell my husband to park it better.

671
00:58:21,582 --> 00:58:25,543
I'm saying that to keep you
from coming down each time.

672
00:58:25,627 --> 00:58:28,713
Take my space for a couple of hours.

673
00:58:28,797 --> 00:58:30,506
No, we'll find somewhere.

674
00:58:30,591 --> 00:58:31,924
As you like.

675
00:58:32,843 --> 00:58:34,760
Leave it, I'll park it.

676
00:58:38,974 --> 00:58:42,185
My wife said you're not going to the police.

677
00:58:42,269 --> 00:58:43,269
No.

678
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:46,731
You're right. What's the point?

679
00:58:46,815 --> 00:58:48,983
You'll have to justify

680
00:58:49,067 --> 00:58:50,985
letting him in.

681
00:58:51,069 --> 00:58:55,364
There would be a trial
and all kinds of stories.

682
00:58:55,449 --> 00:58:56,490
For nothing.

683
00:58:56,950 --> 00:59:01,746
He'll end up coming for his pickup.
You'll let me know?

684
00:59:02,122 --> 00:59:04,248
I want to see that jerk.

685
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:21,057
I'll move my car out
and come and park yours.

686
00:59:21,141 --> 00:59:22,808
I'll do it.

687
00:59:22,893 --> 00:59:24,518
Thanks. Goodbye.

688
00:59:25,312 --> 00:59:26,437
Goodbye.

689
00:59:56,009 --> 00:59:57,718
- How's it going?
- And you?

690
00:59:58,178 --> 00:59:59,220
Is Rana there?

691
00:59:59,388 --> 01:00:01,889
- She's not with you?
- No, on her own.

692
01:00:01,974 --> 01:00:03,474
Any news of the guy?

693
01:00:07,187 --> 01:00:08,229
What guy?

694
01:00:10,190 --> 01:00:12,984
Your neighbors spoke to Babak.

695
01:00:16,238 --> 01:00:18,572
- Is he here?
- Babak?

696
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:20,574
Yes, inside.

697
01:00:28,542 --> 01:00:30,418
- Hi.
- Hi.

698
01:00:30,502 --> 01:00:32,169
Why didn't you tell me?

699
01:00:33,714 --> 01:00:36,549
- What?
- That the guy came to your place.

700
01:00:38,844 --> 01:00:39,927
How's Rana?

701
01:00:40,846 --> 01:00:42,305
The neighbors told you.

702
01:00:44,725 --> 01:00:46,309
Poor things are worried.

703
01:00:46,393 --> 01:00:48,227
Say nothing happened.

704
01:00:49,646 --> 01:00:53,482
Why did you keep his pickup
in the parking lot?

705
01:00:54,401 --> 01:00:56,902
Tell them we're looking for a place,

706
01:00:57,487 --> 01:00:58,821
and we're leaving soon.

707
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:02,992
You think I'll let you leave?

708
01:01:04,453 --> 01:01:08,205
Can you arrange a meeting with your tenant?

709
01:01:09,041 --> 01:01:11,208
- Why?
- I want to speak to her.

710
01:01:12,002 --> 01:01:13,794
I want to know why she did it.

711
01:01:13,879 --> 01:01:15,338
Did what?

712
01:01:15,422 --> 01:01:16,922
What she did.

713
01:01:17,591 --> 01:01:20,134
She sent that guy to us.

714
01:01:20,218 --> 01:01:22,094
Why would she do that?

715
01:01:22,179 --> 01:01:25,181
You said she threatened you.

716
01:01:25,265 --> 01:01:26,599
She's not like that.

717
01:01:26,975 --> 01:01:29,685
It's just that
she's got nowhere for her things.

718
01:01:29,770 --> 01:01:32,355
She said that because she was mad at me.

719
01:01:34,232 --> 01:01:36,233
- Hi.
- Hi.

720
01:01:36,651 --> 01:01:37,693
Feeling better?

721
01:01:38,236 --> 01:01:39,820
Fine, thanks.

722
01:01:48,747 --> 01:01:50,873
Did you tell them?

723
01:01:50,957 --> 01:01:51,957
No.

724
01:01:52,042 --> 01:01:53,250
How do they know?

725
01:01:53,752 --> 01:01:56,212
A neighbor called Babak.

726
01:01:56,296 --> 01:01:57,671
I don't know.

727
01:01:59,341 --> 01:02:02,009
Emad, makeup's waiting for you.

728
01:02:05,305 --> 01:02:07,223
My costume isn't there.

729
01:02:07,808 --> 01:02:09,683
Kati's replacing you.

730
01:02:20,862 --> 01:02:22,446
And you said nothing?

731
01:02:22,531 --> 01:02:25,074
What could I say?

732
01:02:25,158 --> 01:02:28,077
She's the director. It's her choice.

733
01:02:28,161 --> 01:02:31,205
If you feel okay, go to makeup.
I'll talk to her.

734
01:02:31,915 --> 01:02:32,915
Don't bother.

735
01:02:34,501 --> 01:02:36,293
Did you see any apartments?

736
01:02:37,546 --> 01:02:38,963
No, I'll go.

737
01:02:40,715 --> 01:02:41,799
When I have time.

738
01:02:41,883 --> 01:02:45,761
When you have time?
Do you know what I'm going through?

739
01:02:45,846 --> 01:02:47,304
You did nothing.

740
01:02:50,350 --> 01:02:53,436
You won't let me go to the police.

741
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:57,106
You said you'd find a replacement at school.

742
01:02:57,190 --> 01:02:59,442
I couldn't find anyone.

743
01:02:59,526 --> 01:03:00,526
Hmm.

744
01:03:07,701 --> 01:03:09,201
Rana?

745
01:03:09,286 --> 01:03:10,744
Yes?

746
01:03:10,829 --> 01:03:12,955
Why aren't you playing tonight?

747
01:03:14,332 --> 01:03:15,833
I don't feel well.

748
01:03:16,501 --> 01:03:18,627
Why did you come, then?

749
01:03:18,712 --> 01:03:20,671
I was bored at home.

750
01:03:21,298 --> 01:03:22,339
What?

751
01:03:23,425 --> 01:03:24,717
At home, I'm bored.

752
01:03:27,679 --> 01:03:30,931
I'm bored here.

753
01:03:33,518 --> 01:03:35,394
Want to come to my place?

754
01:03:37,147 --> 01:03:38,772
Do you have SpongeBob?

755
01:03:38,857 --> 01:03:41,108
No, but we'll buy it.

756
01:03:41,193 --> 01:03:43,944
You have to come back tomorrow.

757
01:03:44,029 --> 01:03:47,907
It's a mess. Everybody's screwing up.

758
01:03:49,409 --> 01:03:50,784
Why?

759
01:03:50,869 --> 01:03:52,953
We're all upset.

760
01:03:53,038 --> 01:03:54,955
You're better, you can come back.

761
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:58,792
- Mommy, can I go to Rana's?
- No, sweetie.

762
01:03:58,877 --> 01:04:01,962
Let him come, I'm all alone.

763
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:03,797
He'll be back tomorrow.

764
01:04:04,090 --> 01:04:05,382
I can't.

765
01:04:05,467 --> 01:04:08,177
His dad's taking him tomorrow night.

766
01:04:12,766 --> 01:04:15,017
He can pick him up from our place.

767
01:04:21,024 --> 01:04:23,067
- Do you want to go?
- Yes.

768
01:04:23,401 --> 01:04:24,860
Will you be good?

769
01:04:25,403 --> 01:04:27,446
He will.

770
01:04:27,531 --> 01:04:30,449
Tell Emad we took the car.

771
01:04:31,952 --> 01:04:33,953
I'll get his things.

772
01:04:39,668 --> 01:04:42,419
- I need to go to the bathroom.
- Go, quick.

773
01:04:45,590 --> 01:04:47,633
Whose bike is that?

774
01:04:47,717 --> 01:04:49,552
A child's.

775
01:04:56,893 --> 01:04:58,561
Where is he?

776
01:04:58,645 --> 01:05:00,729
He's gone away.

777
01:05:00,814 --> 01:05:01,939
Where?

778
01:05:03,149 --> 01:05:05,067
Where did he go?

779
01:05:05,151 --> 01:05:07,903
Another house. And the bathroom?

780
01:05:07,988 --> 01:05:09,613
- I'm going.
- It's there.

781
01:05:11,658 --> 01:05:13,158
The other side.

782
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:15,911
But...

783
01:05:16,871 --> 01:05:17,955
It's all dark.

784
01:05:18,039 --> 01:05:19,373
I'm coming.

785
01:05:22,919 --> 01:05:25,045
It's scary in there.

786
01:05:25,130 --> 01:05:26,213
Come on.

787
01:05:28,508 --> 01:05:31,343
I don't want to now.

788
01:05:31,803 --> 01:05:32,928
I'll come with you.

789
01:05:33,013 --> 01:05:36,015
No, go away.

790
01:05:36,766 --> 01:05:38,267
I'll do it myself.

791
01:05:39,603 --> 01:05:41,270
Are you shy?

792
01:05:43,565 --> 01:05:44,940
Can you do it yourself?

793
01:06:06,338 --> 01:06:08,756
I'm coloring in his mustache.

794
01:06:18,350 --> 01:06:19,350
Yes?

795
01:06:20,310 --> 01:06:21,560
Come up, honey.

796
01:06:21,936 --> 01:06:23,562
Who is it?

797
01:06:24,022 --> 01:06:25,022
Emad.

798
01:06:25,482 --> 01:06:29,568
If it's my daddy, say I'm not here.

799
01:06:29,653 --> 01:06:30,694
Why?

800
01:06:31,821 --> 01:06:33,864
Because it's Mommy I like.

801
01:06:33,948 --> 01:06:35,074
Okay.

802
01:06:49,631 --> 01:06:51,382
- Rana?
- Hi.

803
01:06:51,466 --> 01:06:53,592
The pickup's gone.

804
01:06:53,677 --> 01:06:55,469
I parked it outside.

805
01:06:55,553 --> 01:06:56,595
Why?

806
01:06:57,430 --> 01:07:00,683
I was fed up having to move it.

807
01:07:00,767 --> 01:07:01,809
Hi.

808
01:07:01,893 --> 01:07:04,645
Hey, big guy.

809
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:07,731
- Where's the key?
- Where you left it.

810
01:07:09,234 --> 01:07:12,403
How's it going? Good to see you here!

811
01:07:13,238 --> 01:07:14,655
Make yourself at home.

812
01:07:19,119 --> 01:07:21,370
- Don't go and get it.
- I'll be back soon.

813
01:07:21,830 --> 01:07:22,913
Emad...

814
01:07:25,959 --> 01:07:28,961
Just let it be tonight.

815
01:07:29,254 --> 01:07:32,339
I made a nice dinner.
Get changed and come and eat.

816
01:07:32,924 --> 01:07:34,133
Come on, sweetie.

817
01:07:46,062 --> 01:07:48,689
Ready for takeoff,
ladies and gentlemen.

818
01:07:48,815 --> 01:07:50,524
Yay.

819
01:07:53,236 --> 01:07:54,528
Sadra.

820
01:07:55,488 --> 01:07:56,613
Yes?

821
01:07:56,698 --> 01:07:58,449
Emad, it'll get cold.

822
01:07:58,533 --> 01:07:59,950
Coming.

823
01:08:00,034 --> 01:08:01,910
Go and wash your hands.

824
01:08:01,995 --> 01:08:03,829
But my hands are clean.

825
01:08:03,913 --> 01:08:05,706
Wash them again.

826
01:08:05,790 --> 01:08:08,292
What a feast!

827
01:08:10,211 --> 01:08:12,171
It looks delicious.

828
01:08:13,047 --> 01:08:14,339
A real cordon bleu.

829
01:08:14,424 --> 01:08:15,966
Hands off!

830
01:08:16,050 --> 01:08:19,261
Rana, where are you?

831
01:08:20,013 --> 01:08:23,056
Sadra, come quick!

832
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:25,517
Here I am

833
01:08:25,602 --> 01:08:29,438
So, you two hit the town without me?

834
01:08:29,522 --> 01:08:33,609
We went for a walk and did some shopping...

835
01:08:33,693 --> 01:08:36,403
But we didn't find SpongeBob.

836
01:08:36,488 --> 01:08:37,863
Too bad.

837
01:08:37,947 --> 01:08:39,239
"Don't worry, Patrick!

838
01:08:39,324 --> 01:08:41,617
"One fine day, we'll meet again,

839
01:08:41,701 --> 01:08:43,202
"you and me. "

840
01:08:43,953 --> 01:08:46,163
"You see that, SpongeBob?

841
01:08:48,082 --> 01:08:51,126
"Rana made us pasta!"

842
01:08:53,546 --> 01:08:55,881
- More?
- No, thanks.

843
01:08:56,466 --> 01:08:58,217
You can have more later.

844
01:08:58,885 --> 01:09:00,052
Thanks.

845
01:09:04,098 --> 01:09:05,224
Yummy, pasta.

846
01:09:05,809 --> 01:09:08,352
- Enjoy yourself.
- Eat up.

847
01:09:08,978 --> 01:09:11,730
- What a cordon bleu.
- You're right.

848
01:09:13,733 --> 01:09:15,442
How was the performance?

849
01:09:16,110 --> 01:09:17,277
It was really

850
01:09:17,821 --> 01:09:19,404
crappy.

851
01:09:19,489 --> 01:09:20,489
Pathetic.

852
01:09:20,907 --> 01:09:22,407
Yeah, sure.

853
01:09:22,492 --> 01:09:24,743
That's how it is, without you.

854
01:09:26,454 --> 01:09:28,121
Did you find the card?

855
01:09:28,206 --> 01:09:29,206
No.

856
01:09:31,751 --> 01:09:34,753
- How did you pay?
- With the money you left.

857
01:09:37,257 --> 01:09:38,507
What money?

858
01:09:38,591 --> 01:09:39,967
In the drawer.

859
01:09:54,858 --> 01:09:57,192
What? Don't you like it?

860
01:09:57,277 --> 01:09:59,111
It's not very good?

861
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:10,664
Don't eat it.

862
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:13,876
Why?

863
01:10:23,011 --> 01:10:25,804
It's that bastard's money.

864
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:55,626
- Sadra, sweetie?
- Mmm.

865
01:10:56,628 --> 01:10:57,920
Tell me...

866
01:10:58,671 --> 01:11:00,631
- ... do you like pizza?
- Yes.

867
01:11:01,466 --> 01:11:05,052
We'll order one. Don't eat that.
It's not good.

868
01:11:08,181 --> 01:11:10,057
You want fries, too?

869
01:11:10,892 --> 01:11:12,559
And ice cream?

870
01:11:19,776 --> 01:11:22,486
Hi, call me when you can.

871
01:11:23,905 --> 01:11:26,198
Hello, Mommy?

872
01:11:26,282 --> 01:11:27,783
Mommy?

873
01:11:28,743 --> 01:11:29,910
When are you...

874
01:11:30,453 --> 01:11:32,371
Hello, Ahoo?

875
01:11:32,997 --> 01:11:34,247
Are you there?

876
01:11:35,708 --> 01:11:38,126
This is my third call.

877
01:11:41,422 --> 01:11:43,048
Ahoo, darling, it's Babak.

878
01:11:45,134 --> 01:11:49,221
Ahoo...

879
01:11:51,349 --> 01:11:52,849
Are you there?

880
01:11:55,103 --> 01:11:56,478
You're not there.

881
01:11:57,814 --> 01:11:58,897
Okay.

882
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:01,525
Call me when you get home.

883
01:12:01,609 --> 01:12:03,276
Even late.

884
01:12:06,823 --> 01:12:08,365
What are you doing?

885
01:12:09,909 --> 01:12:10,993
Nothing.

886
01:12:11,703 --> 01:12:13,078
Go to bed.

887
01:12:13,913 --> 01:12:15,330
That's two nights now.

888
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:17,499
I can't sleep.

889
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:29,302
Why did you open her letters?
That's private.

890
01:12:29,387 --> 01:12:31,013
I want to know who he is.

891
01:12:31,723 --> 01:12:35,392
What for? He'll say it was a mistake.

892
01:12:35,810 --> 01:12:37,144
A mistake?

893
01:12:37,437 --> 01:12:39,813
He buzzed, I opened.

894
01:12:40,565 --> 01:12:43,650
He must've thought it was her.

895
01:12:43,735 --> 01:12:46,903
And when he realized his mistake,

896
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:48,739
why did he stay?

897
01:12:49,532 --> 01:12:51,867
Because there was a woman in the shower.

898
01:12:51,951 --> 01:12:54,911
- How would he know?
- Your clothes on the bed.

899
01:12:58,666 --> 01:13:01,543
If I'd answered the damn intercom

900
01:13:01,627 --> 01:13:04,171
and asked who it was,

901
01:13:05,048 --> 01:13:06,757
he wouldn't have come up.

902
01:13:06,841 --> 01:13:10,969
Okay, so go to the neighbors and explain

903
01:13:11,054 --> 01:13:13,180
you should've answered.

904
01:13:13,264 --> 01:13:16,558
- What business is it of theirs?
- They know.

905
01:13:16,642 --> 01:13:18,435
That's all that matters?

906
01:13:18,519 --> 01:13:19,728
What do you mean?

907
01:13:39,791 --> 01:13:42,459
- The pickup's gone.
- What?

908
01:13:43,461 --> 01:13:45,128
Sorry.

909
01:13:46,798 --> 01:13:47,798
Where was it?

910
01:13:48,508 --> 01:13:49,466
There.

911
01:13:49,550 --> 01:13:50,550
Sorry.

912
01:13:54,931 --> 01:13:57,432
- Where did you park it?
- There.

913
01:14:00,728 --> 01:14:03,522
- There?
- Where the Peugeot is.

914
01:14:11,322 --> 01:14:12,739
He's taken it.

915
01:14:13,950 --> 01:14:15,867
I have to find that guy.

916
01:14:33,886 --> 01:14:35,345
Asshole!

917
01:14:41,602 --> 01:14:43,436
Okay, slow down.

918
01:15:10,131 --> 01:15:11,923
You'll catch cold.

919
01:15:12,675 --> 01:15:15,927
Don't be stubborn,
we can go to the public baths.

920
01:15:16,012 --> 01:15:18,680
I'll be quick. Stay there.

921
01:15:28,733 --> 01:15:30,233
- Hassanpour.
- Hello.

922
01:15:39,285 --> 01:15:40,869
Hello, sir.

923
01:15:41,412 --> 01:15:42,787
How are you?

924
01:15:42,872 --> 01:15:45,707
Your father's at the
traffic office, isn't he?

925
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:47,709
He's retired now, why?

926
01:15:48,628 --> 01:15:50,587
A guy ran over my wife and fled.

927
01:15:50,671 --> 01:15:53,215
- Nothing serious?
- No, luckily.

928
01:15:55,051 --> 01:15:58,220
Given the pickup's number,

929
01:15:58,304 --> 01:16:02,224
could your father find his address?

930
01:16:02,308 --> 01:16:06,728
His colleagues could. Give me the number.

931
01:16:06,812 --> 01:16:08,521
But you have to report it first.

932
01:16:08,606 --> 01:16:12,567
It's not too serious.
I don't want the police involved.

933
01:16:12,944 --> 01:16:16,112
I'll call my father right away.

934
01:16:16,197 --> 01:16:18,323
Get me a pen and paper.

935
01:16:24,455 --> 01:16:25,747
Why don't you work for me?

936
01:16:25,831 --> 01:16:28,291
What's the matter with you? I've got a job.

937
01:16:29,001 --> 01:16:30,919
Why walk in here every week?

938
01:16:36,676 --> 01:16:38,635
If you don't want me to walk in here...

939
01:16:38,719 --> 01:16:40,595
I'm offering you a job.

940
01:16:40,680 --> 01:16:44,182
I don't want your goddam job!

941
01:16:44,267 --> 01:16:45,600
Move, Charley.

942
01:16:45,685 --> 01:16:47,477
When are you going to grow up?

943
01:16:47,561 --> 01:16:49,562
God damn you, Charley.

944
01:16:49,647 --> 01:16:53,400
You big ignoramus.

945
01:16:53,484 --> 01:16:55,694
How dare you?

946
01:16:55,778 --> 01:16:59,614
If you say that to me again,
I'll rap you one.

947
01:17:02,034 --> 01:17:04,202
To hell with your money!

948
01:17:05,121 --> 01:17:07,414
Dirty rat!

949
01:17:20,219 --> 01:17:21,511
What got into you?

950
01:17:22,138 --> 01:17:23,221
What?

951
01:17:23,306 --> 01:17:25,265
Making up lines.

952
01:17:25,349 --> 01:17:27,142
Like what?

953
01:17:27,226 --> 01:17:29,060
If something's wrong, tell me.

954
01:17:29,437 --> 01:17:31,938
Instead of calling me a rat on stage.

955
01:17:32,273 --> 01:17:34,607
It's not improvising, it's insulting.

956
01:17:34,692 --> 01:17:35,984
You upset?

957
01:17:36,319 --> 01:17:37,319
Absolutely.

958
01:17:38,446 --> 01:17:41,448
Next time, I'll answer in public.

959
01:17:42,283 --> 01:17:44,117
The rat's the one who insults.

960
01:17:44,201 --> 01:17:45,785
I didn't know.

961
01:17:46,746 --> 01:17:47,787
Excuse me.

962
01:18:04,221 --> 01:18:06,723
The Bakery

963
01:18:14,648 --> 01:18:15,815
Shalom.

964
01:18:40,508 --> 01:18:41,966
Yes?

965
01:18:43,052 --> 01:18:44,886
Two baguettes.

966
01:18:47,765 --> 01:18:50,266
- Sliced?
- Yes, please.

967
01:18:50,518 --> 01:18:53,228
- Is that your pickup?
- Why?

968
01:18:53,312 --> 01:18:55,772
They're handing out tickets.

969
01:18:56,982 --> 01:18:59,818
Majid, move the pickup,

970
01:18:59,902 --> 01:19:02,112
or we'll get a ticket.

971
01:19:12,540 --> 01:19:14,707
Soheyl, give me the keys.

972
01:19:21,048 --> 01:19:22,424
Goodbye.

973
01:19:22,508 --> 01:19:24,384
Goodbye. Here.

974
01:20:11,223 --> 01:20:12,891
I'll take some water.

975
01:20:13,350 --> 01:20:15,518
Hello, is this your pickup?

976
01:20:15,603 --> 01:20:16,728
Yes.

977
01:20:17,188 --> 01:20:19,647
Could you do a small move?

978
01:20:19,732 --> 01:20:20,773
It's for deliveries.

979
01:20:21,358 --> 01:20:22,817
Not now, later.

980
01:20:22,902 --> 01:20:25,236
It's not my job.

981
01:20:26,322 --> 01:20:28,364
- How about this weekend?
- I'm busy.

982
01:20:28,699 --> 01:20:30,617
There's rental places nearby.

983
01:20:30,701 --> 01:20:33,578
It's for books and paintings.

984
01:20:33,662 --> 01:20:38,124
I don't want something open.
It's better with a cover.

985
01:20:38,209 --> 01:20:40,126
I won't have time.

986
01:20:40,211 --> 01:20:43,254
Name your price,
as long as it arrives safely.

987
01:20:43,672 --> 01:20:45,590
I can't.

988
01:20:45,674 --> 01:20:48,176
Majid, do him a favor.

989
01:20:49,053 --> 01:20:52,388
Give me your number, I'll call you.

990
01:20:52,890 --> 01:20:54,182
I'd rather it was you.

991
01:20:54,266 --> 01:20:56,768
Go on, Majid, fix it for him.

992
01:21:00,022 --> 01:21:02,106
Be careful.

993
01:21:08,781 --> 01:21:10,740
What are you doing there?

994
01:21:10,824 --> 01:21:12,450
Come here.

995
01:21:17,039 --> 01:21:19,999
Be careful. Go easy.

996
01:21:20,084 --> 01:21:22,669
Tell them to come for some tea.

997
01:21:22,753 --> 01:21:24,295
That's nice of you.

998
01:21:24,380 --> 01:21:26,047
Drink it while it's hot.

999
01:21:29,176 --> 01:21:30,718
Where will you take it?

1000
01:21:31,595 --> 01:21:35,223
My parents' garage, for the time being.

1001
01:21:35,307 --> 01:21:36,975
She's not coming, then?

1002
01:21:37,059 --> 01:21:40,144
She's got problems. She can't find a place.

1003
01:21:47,736 --> 01:21:49,821
Babak's here for her things.

1004
01:21:50,614 --> 01:21:51,823
So?

1005
01:21:56,412 --> 01:21:57,704
Have you fallen out?

1006
01:21:58,455 --> 01:22:01,040
No, get him to take them, that's all.

1007
01:22:02,084 --> 01:22:03,126
Rana?

1008
01:22:09,842 --> 01:22:13,177
Majid? It's Mr. Etesami.

1009
01:22:13,262 --> 01:22:14,637
Are you free?

1010
01:22:16,307 --> 01:22:17,432
And Friday?

1011
01:23:27,378 --> 01:23:28,544
Who's there?

1012
01:23:31,507 --> 01:23:32,882
Come up.

1013
01:23:54,238 --> 01:23:55,780
Hello.

1014
01:23:55,864 --> 01:23:58,282
Hello, sir. How are you?

1015
01:23:58,367 --> 01:24:02,120
Is it here for the move?
Majid sent me.

1016
01:24:02,204 --> 01:24:04,330
Yes, come in. He's not with you?

1017
01:24:04,415 --> 01:24:07,375
He's busy. He sent me instead.

1018
01:24:09,461 --> 01:24:10,586
After you.

1019
01:24:10,671 --> 01:24:12,964
He didn't mention the stairs.

1020
01:24:13,882 --> 01:24:15,007
I've got a bad heart.

1021
01:24:15,092 --> 01:24:20,179
If I'd known,
I'd have said the elevator was broken.

1022
01:24:20,264 --> 01:24:22,598
I can't take elevators either.

1023
01:24:22,683 --> 01:24:24,809
May I have a glass of water?

1024
01:24:29,815 --> 01:24:31,357
Is there any help?

1025
01:24:32,109 --> 01:24:35,987
No, it's just a few boxes.
I was going to do it with him.

1026
01:24:36,071 --> 01:24:37,989
He's too busy, poor thing.

1027
01:24:39,241 --> 01:24:41,033
- He's your son?
- Son-in-law.

1028
01:24:41,368 --> 01:24:43,494
But it's like he's mine.

1029
01:24:51,754 --> 01:24:55,757
I'm sorry, we've just moved,
there's no glasses.

1030
01:24:55,841 --> 01:24:57,091
No problem.

1031
01:25:00,262 --> 01:25:02,180
Where are the boxes?

1032
01:25:02,848 --> 01:25:04,182
In the bedroom.

1033
01:25:04,725 --> 01:25:07,518
We'll see if we need a hand.

1034
01:25:10,063 --> 01:25:14,984
Call him. If he's nearby,
I'll go and get him.

1035
01:25:15,068 --> 01:25:16,110
Who?

1036
01:25:16,653 --> 01:25:17,695
Your son-in-law.

1037
01:25:18,197 --> 01:25:21,699
They've gone shopping for the wedding.

1038
01:25:27,831 --> 01:25:29,707
There's no janitor?

1039
01:25:29,792 --> 01:25:31,083
No, it's empty.

1040
01:25:31,794 --> 01:25:34,295
Some walls collapsed. We had to evacuate.

1041
01:25:35,798 --> 01:25:37,965
It's not going to fall on our heads?

1042
01:25:38,050 --> 01:25:41,427
Let's look and see if we need any help.

1043
01:25:41,929 --> 01:25:43,012
Sir?

1044
01:25:45,098 --> 01:25:47,892
Have a seat, I need to talk to you.

1045
01:25:47,976 --> 01:25:50,603
Listen, it's not my job.

1046
01:25:50,687 --> 01:25:55,191
Majid said you insisted,
and I agreed to come.

1047
01:25:55,859 --> 01:25:58,152
Give me whatever you like.

1048
01:25:59,905 --> 01:26:02,240
It's not that.

1049
01:26:02,324 --> 01:26:05,660
Sit down, I need to tell you something.

1050
01:26:09,122 --> 01:26:10,790
Nothing serious, I hope.

1051
01:26:14,378 --> 01:26:16,379
How long have you known him?

1052
01:26:16,630 --> 01:26:18,589
- My son-in-law?
- Yes.

1053
01:26:18,757 --> 01:26:21,384
- Why?
- To see if you know him well.

1054
01:26:22,135 --> 01:26:25,346
He's been courting my daughter
for two years.

1055
01:26:25,430 --> 01:26:27,890
Have you made inquiries about him?

1056
01:26:30,227 --> 01:26:32,228
Do you know Majid?

1057
01:26:33,480 --> 01:26:34,856
Tell me anything you know.

1058
01:26:36,692 --> 01:26:40,444
My wife and I moved into a new apartment.

1059
01:26:41,864 --> 01:26:43,698
And the previous tenant

1060
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:48,744
was a woman
with lots of acquaintances, as it were.

1061
01:26:49,913 --> 01:26:52,206
One night I hadn't got back yet,

1062
01:26:53,041 --> 01:26:54,458
my wife was alone.

1063
01:26:55,210 --> 01:26:58,629
Some bastard,
thinking he was going to see her,

1064
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:01,340
came into my home.

1065
01:27:03,510 --> 01:27:07,471
My wife was in the bathroom and he went in.

1066
01:27:07,556 --> 01:27:08,598
Who?

1067
01:27:08,891 --> 01:27:11,183
Your son of a bitch of a son-in-law.

1068
01:27:14,521 --> 01:27:17,607
How do you know it was him?

1069
01:27:17,691 --> 01:27:20,067
My wife started yelling,

1070
01:27:20,152 --> 01:27:24,030
and he ran off, forgetting his pickup.

1071
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:28,242
I tracked him down
and went to the shop where he works.

1072
01:27:28,952 --> 01:27:32,371
I almost grabbed him in
front of his buddies,

1073
01:27:34,499 --> 01:27:36,584
to humiliate him in public.

1074
01:27:37,127 --> 01:27:38,169
But...

1075
01:27:39,755 --> 01:27:41,172
I couldn't do it.

1076
01:27:41,256 --> 01:27:44,926
- Other people use the pickup.
- That's why I want to see him.

1077
01:27:45,010 --> 01:27:49,221
I want to know if it was him
or somebody else.

1078
01:27:49,306 --> 01:27:51,223
Majid's not like that.

1079
01:27:52,935 --> 01:27:56,604
If I find out it was him,
I'll cancel the wedding.

1080
01:28:02,235 --> 01:28:03,694
How is your wife?

1081
01:28:06,114 --> 01:28:07,156
That's bad.

1082
01:28:11,662 --> 01:28:13,829
I'll talk to him this evening.

1083
01:28:13,914 --> 01:28:15,706
Call him and tell him to come.

1084
01:28:16,375 --> 01:28:18,542
I want to ask him who it was.

1085
01:28:18,627 --> 01:28:23,589
He's buying wedding stuff
with my wife and daughter.

1086
01:28:24,841 --> 01:28:25,967
Well, call him

1087
01:28:26,969 --> 01:28:30,221
and ask him who had the pickup that night.

1088
01:28:31,014 --> 01:28:32,181
When was it?

1089
01:28:32,557 --> 01:28:33,891
Two weeks ago.

1090
01:28:37,646 --> 01:28:42,108
Okay, let me speak to him tonight.

1091
01:28:44,778 --> 01:28:47,154
But I want to speak to him...

1092
01:28:47,239 --> 01:28:49,740
Wait. I want to speak to him.

1093
01:28:50,409 --> 01:28:51,951
Call him.

1094
01:28:52,035 --> 01:28:54,203
I don't have his number.

1095
01:28:55,122 --> 01:28:56,205
I've got it.

1096
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,543
I want you to tell him to come,

1097
01:29:00,627 --> 01:29:03,212
so I don't have to go to his shop.

1098
01:29:03,296 --> 01:29:06,382
First, let me make sure it was him.

1099
01:29:06,466 --> 01:29:09,135
I need to speak to him...

1100
01:29:09,219 --> 01:29:11,846
Otherwise I'll call myself.

1101
01:29:11,930 --> 01:29:12,930
Shall we do that?

1102
01:29:15,892 --> 01:29:18,060
I'll call.

1103
01:29:31,658 --> 01:29:34,493
Majid? Hello, son.

1104
01:29:34,578 --> 01:29:36,287
Where are you?

1105
01:29:37,372 --> 01:29:39,165
Yes, at the gentleman's.

1106
01:29:41,877 --> 01:29:42,918
Who are you with?

1107
01:29:45,380 --> 01:29:47,757
Call me when you're alone.

1108
01:29:47,841 --> 01:29:49,592
We need to talk.

1109
01:29:51,845 --> 01:29:53,387
At my number.

1110
01:29:55,098 --> 01:29:57,725
I don't know it. Ask Mojgan.

1111
01:30:00,270 --> 01:30:01,353
Okay.

1112
01:30:01,897 --> 01:30:03,355
Nothing serious.

1113
01:30:04,232 --> 01:30:05,566
Bye.

1114
01:30:07,736 --> 01:30:09,528
He'll call when he's alone.

1115
01:30:10,822 --> 01:30:12,573
What do you do?

1116
01:30:14,076 --> 01:30:16,368
I work with Majid's pickup.

1117
01:30:17,204 --> 01:30:20,289
I sell clothes by the roadside
in the evenings.

1118
01:30:20,373 --> 01:30:23,334
I don't go out during the day
because of my heart.

1119
01:30:23,752 --> 01:30:25,377
Tell me something,

1120
01:30:26,296 --> 01:30:29,757
how come you don't have
your son-in-law's number?

1121
01:30:29,841 --> 01:30:30,883
Well, I don't.

1122
01:30:31,009 --> 01:30:33,427
I don't have many numbers.

1123
01:30:33,512 --> 01:30:34,845
Have you just changed phones?

1124
01:30:36,014 --> 01:30:37,014
No.

1125
01:30:55,450 --> 01:30:58,494
How come he doesn't have your number?

1126
01:30:59,329 --> 01:31:02,289
You told him to ask somebody, didn't you?

1127
01:31:02,374 --> 01:31:04,333
I don't know...

1128
01:31:04,417 --> 01:31:08,546
I'm so upset, I don't even know who I am.

1129
01:31:11,591 --> 01:31:13,384
- Wait.
- It's locked?

1130
01:31:13,468 --> 01:31:15,761
Wait for a bit.

1131
01:31:17,097 --> 01:31:19,807
Could you take off your shoes?

1132
01:31:19,891 --> 01:31:21,100
What for?

1133
01:31:21,560 --> 01:31:23,310
I want to see your feet.

1134
01:31:24,146 --> 01:31:28,274
I could be your father! Let me go!

1135
01:31:28,358 --> 01:31:32,236
Fine, no need to get excited.

1136
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:35,531
Take them off and I'll let you go.

1137
01:31:35,615 --> 01:31:39,743
Why should I? Open this door!

1138
01:31:40,412 --> 01:31:41,495
Come here.

1139
01:31:41,955 --> 01:31:44,582
Please. Come here.

1140
01:31:53,049 --> 01:31:55,176
Sit, and take off your shoes.

1141
01:31:57,137 --> 01:32:01,473
Sit down.

1142
01:32:03,185 --> 01:32:04,351
Go on, sit.

1143
01:32:10,734 --> 01:32:13,694
- Take them off.
- I don't feel well.

1144
01:32:13,778 --> 01:32:15,362
I'll help you.

1145
01:32:15,447 --> 01:32:17,323
I'll do it.

1146
01:32:28,418 --> 01:32:29,668
The other one, too.

1147
01:32:30,170 --> 01:32:31,212
Okay.

1148
01:32:38,011 --> 01:32:39,470
The socks.

1149
01:32:41,681 --> 01:32:44,391
- What do you want with me?
- Take them off.

1150
01:32:44,476 --> 01:32:46,310
I'll do it for you.

1151
01:32:46,895 --> 01:32:48,854
Let me do it.

1152
01:34:07,100 --> 01:34:08,100
Yes, Siavash?

1153
01:34:11,104 --> 01:34:12,104
No.

1154
01:34:12,188 --> 01:34:13,522
I'm busy.

1155
01:34:14,733 --> 01:34:15,858
What's the time?

1156
01:34:17,944 --> 01:34:19,737
I won't be long, don't worry.

1157
01:34:21,948 --> 01:34:23,532
She'll make her own way.

1158
01:34:24,534 --> 01:34:26,118
She's got things to do.

1159
01:34:26,202 --> 01:34:27,578
Yes, I'm fine.

1160
01:34:28,788 --> 01:34:29,997
See you later.

1161
01:34:32,125 --> 01:34:35,461
I swear I didn't want to bother anybody.

1162
01:34:37,130 --> 01:34:40,174
Did that woman ask you to come?

1163
01:34:40,258 --> 01:34:43,052
She'd been texting me for a month.

1164
01:34:43,136 --> 01:34:48,265
"If you've got the pickup, drop by,
I've got a favor to ask. "

1165
01:34:48,350 --> 01:34:50,559
And I replied, "Ahoo, dear,

1166
01:34:50,643 --> 01:34:54,021
"sorry, I'm sick, I can't come. "

1167
01:34:54,731 --> 01:34:55,981
She got annoyed.

1168
01:34:56,066 --> 01:35:00,611
She wouldn't answer my texts or calls.

1169
01:35:01,237 --> 01:35:02,363
She was sulking.

1170
01:35:03,239 --> 01:35:05,532
That night, I wanted to make up...

1171
01:35:05,992 --> 01:35:07,534
You didn't know she'd left?

1172
01:35:07,619 --> 01:35:09,703
No, on my children's heads.

1173
01:35:09,788 --> 01:35:11,789
You went into the apartment,

1174
01:35:11,873 --> 01:35:15,334
you must've seen it had changed.

1175
01:35:15,418 --> 01:35:20,798
I saw the mess, the bike I got the kid...

1176
01:35:22,258 --> 01:35:23,717
I thought she was moving.

1177
01:35:23,802 --> 01:35:26,387
Tell the truth and you can go.

1178
01:35:26,471 --> 01:35:29,473
If I'd have thought you moved in,

1179
01:35:29,557 --> 01:35:33,310
I'd have been afraid a
man was in the shower.

1180
01:35:33,395 --> 01:35:34,895
My wife's clothes were on the bed.

1181
01:35:34,979 --> 01:35:35,979
I saw nothing.

1182
01:35:36,064 --> 01:35:40,109
You saw there was a woman alone,
and she let you in...

1183
01:35:40,193 --> 01:35:41,902
I didn't see any clothes.

1184
01:35:41,986 --> 01:35:46,240
It happened really fast.
I came in, there was no one.

1185
01:35:46,324 --> 01:35:49,451
And your wife had just let me in.

1186
01:35:49,536 --> 01:35:51,453
Why did she open the door?

1187
01:35:51,538 --> 01:35:53,080
She thought it was me.

1188
01:35:53,164 --> 01:35:55,290
I'm telling you straight.

1189
01:35:55,375 --> 01:35:58,627
I went to the bathroom door
and called the kid.

1190
01:35:59,254 --> 01:36:01,130
Then she started screaming.

1191
01:36:01,214 --> 01:36:03,924
- I took off.
- You went in.

1192
01:36:04,008 --> 01:36:05,634
I didn't.

1193
01:36:05,718 --> 01:36:09,012
- How did you cut yourself, then?
- No idea.

1194
01:36:09,097 --> 01:36:13,350
Downstairs, my foot hurt.
I guess I cut myself on the stairs.

1195
01:36:13,435 --> 01:36:15,894
- So my wife's lying?
- She says I went in?

1196
01:36:15,979 --> 01:36:18,480
If she'd not flung herself
at the glass in fear,

1197
01:36:18,565 --> 01:36:21,442
what would you have done to her, bastard?

1198
01:36:21,901 --> 01:36:23,444
I swear to you,

1199
01:36:23,528 --> 01:36:27,281
I fled when I realized my mistake.

1200
01:36:27,365 --> 01:36:29,450
Ask your wife.

1201
01:36:29,534 --> 01:36:32,119
I'll stay here, bring her.

1202
01:36:32,203 --> 01:36:33,454
To say what?

1203
01:36:35,206 --> 01:36:38,959
She's already said it all.
It's your wife's turn.

1204
01:36:39,043 --> 01:36:41,837
Call her and tell her to come.

1205
01:36:41,921 --> 01:36:44,590
- Why?
- You can repeat it all to her.

1206
01:36:44,674 --> 01:36:47,509
I swear I didn't go in the bathroom.

1207
01:36:47,594 --> 01:36:49,303
Okay.

1208
01:36:49,387 --> 01:36:52,431
Explain to your wife why you were there.

1209
01:36:52,515 --> 01:36:53,682
Call her.

1210
01:36:54,559 --> 01:36:56,101
Get your phone out.

1211
01:36:56,603 --> 01:36:58,187
Get it, I'm telling you.

1212
01:37:03,151 --> 01:37:05,152
Don't humiliate me in front of my family.

1213
01:37:05,612 --> 01:37:06,695
Call her.

1214
01:37:07,155 --> 01:37:10,532
- My daughter's getting married.
- She should know her father.

1215
01:37:11,117 --> 01:37:15,787
I'll tell your son-in-law everything
so he knows his father-in-law.

1216
01:37:16,998 --> 01:37:18,749
I don't need you, get lost.

1217
01:37:20,418 --> 01:37:23,754
I'll call your son-in-law to tell him...

1218
01:37:24,881 --> 01:37:26,465
Leave me alone!

1219
01:37:32,931 --> 01:37:34,348
Help!

1220
01:37:35,308 --> 01:37:36,475
Shut it.

1221
01:37:37,310 --> 01:37:38,560
Open the door!

1222
01:37:40,146 --> 01:37:41,438
I'm dying.

1223
01:37:41,523 --> 01:37:43,524
- Don't make any noise.
- Open up.

1224
01:37:43,608 --> 01:37:45,817
I'm going to faint.

1225
01:37:45,902 --> 01:37:47,903
Open up.

1226
01:37:49,822 --> 01:37:50,989
Open up.

1227
01:37:51,366 --> 01:37:53,742
I'm claustrophobic.

1228
01:37:56,204 --> 01:37:57,955
Please, open up.

1229
01:38:05,630 --> 01:38:07,714
At least, turn on the light.

1230
01:38:34,242 --> 01:38:35,367
My dear,

1231
01:38:37,787 --> 01:38:39,454
forgive me,

1232
01:38:42,709 --> 01:38:44,251
I can't cry.

1233
01:38:46,546 --> 01:38:49,131
Why did you ever do that?

1234
01:38:53,344 --> 01:38:56,179
I don't understand it, Willy.

1235
01:38:57,473 --> 01:38:58,724
Help me.

1236
01:39:03,938 --> 01:39:06,648
It's like you're on another trip.

1237
01:39:07,275 --> 01:39:09,109
I keep expecting you.

1238
01:39:12,530 --> 01:39:13,614
Willy,

1239
01:39:16,034 --> 01:39:18,493
I made the last payment on the house,

1240
01:39:19,746 --> 01:39:21,663
today.

1241
01:39:22,999 --> 01:39:26,293
And there'll be nobody home.

1242
01:39:29,172 --> 01:39:31,548
We're free and clear.

1243
01:39:35,011 --> 01:39:37,220
We're free at last.

1244
01:40:58,928 --> 01:41:00,470
Lock the door and take the key.

1245
01:41:13,568 --> 01:41:14,693
Get up.

1246
01:41:14,777 --> 01:41:16,194
Up.

1247
01:41:32,295 --> 01:41:33,295
Wait.

1248
01:41:35,381 --> 01:41:36,631
Sit here.

1249
01:41:53,691 --> 01:41:55,066
Go into the bedroom.

1250
01:42:25,556 --> 01:42:28,308
You see how upset you've made her?

1251
01:42:36,609 --> 01:42:37,984
There's my wife.

1252
01:42:38,778 --> 01:42:40,695
Are you still saying you didn't go in?

1253
01:42:43,115 --> 01:42:44,449
Forgive me.

1254
01:42:45,076 --> 01:42:46,409
Answer me.

1255
01:42:49,372 --> 01:42:50,789
I behaved badly.

1256
01:42:51,165 --> 01:42:52,958
Why did you go in the bathroom?

1257
01:43:00,216 --> 01:43:01,925
I was tempted.

1258
01:43:08,599 --> 01:43:09,766
Emad.

1259
01:43:13,479 --> 01:43:15,146
What are you going to do to him?

1260
01:43:15,231 --> 01:43:16,940
His family is on the way.

1261
01:43:17,859 --> 01:43:20,360
I want his wife to know.

1262
01:43:21,904 --> 01:43:23,280
Emad.

1263
01:43:28,744 --> 01:43:30,704
You're taking revenge.

1264
01:43:33,708 --> 01:43:35,208
Let him go.

1265
01:43:36,168 --> 01:43:38,003
I know what I'm doing.

1266
01:43:39,505 --> 01:43:41,006
Just stay there.

1267
01:44:04,363 --> 01:44:05,989
Where are you going?

1268
01:44:07,992 --> 01:44:11,036
I feel really sick. Let me go.

1269
01:44:11,537 --> 01:44:12,621
They're coming.

1270
01:44:14,081 --> 01:44:16,958
Your son-in-law called. I told him to come

1271
01:44:17,043 --> 01:44:18,752
with your wife.

1272
01:44:20,421 --> 01:44:22,881
They're coming, sit down.

1273
01:44:29,430 --> 01:44:31,097
Please, let me go.

1274
01:44:31,849 --> 01:44:35,185
Repeat it to them and you can go.

1275
01:44:35,770 --> 01:44:37,354
I'm begging you...

1276
01:44:56,540 --> 01:44:57,666
Madam,

1277
01:44:58,584 --> 01:45:00,001
forgive me.

1278
01:45:00,503 --> 01:45:03,046
Let me go before they arrive.

1279
01:45:21,983 --> 01:45:25,443
We've been married for 35 years.

1280
01:45:38,541 --> 01:45:40,625
Go on, sir, leave.

1281
01:45:44,338 --> 01:45:46,006
Sit down.

1282
01:45:46,090 --> 01:45:47,507
Let him go.

1283
01:45:47,591 --> 01:45:49,718
He's going.

1284
01:45:49,802 --> 01:45:52,137
He'll leave with his family.

1285
01:45:53,097 --> 01:45:54,389
- Stay seated.
- Pity...

1286
01:45:54,473 --> 01:45:56,099
- Go.
- Stay seated.

1287
01:45:56,183 --> 01:45:57,684
My children...

1288
01:45:57,768 --> 01:45:59,894
- Leave him.
- Don't interfere.

1289
01:46:02,148 --> 01:46:03,648
Sit down.

1290
01:46:03,733 --> 01:46:05,400
Sit down, I said!

1291
01:46:05,484 --> 01:46:06,693
Sit there.

1292
01:46:30,676 --> 01:46:32,302
What do you want?

1293
01:46:41,520 --> 01:46:43,813
My God!

1294
01:46:47,568 --> 01:46:49,110
Emad!

1295
01:46:49,445 --> 01:46:52,572
Is there some
medicine he can take?

1296
01:46:52,990 --> 01:46:54,949
Nothing in his pockets.

1297
01:46:55,034 --> 01:46:57,202
Where are you?

1298
01:46:57,495 --> 01:47:00,163
No, come as fast as you can.

1299
01:47:00,456 --> 01:47:01,456
Fine.

1300
01:47:02,124 --> 01:47:05,168
- That's the ambulance?
- No, his family.

1301
01:47:05,795 --> 01:47:06,878
Can you hear me?

1302
01:47:08,130 --> 01:47:09,506
Can you find a pulse?

1303
01:47:09,757 --> 01:47:10,882
Is his heart beating?

1304
01:47:10,966 --> 01:47:12,801
Calm down, please.

1305
01:47:17,014 --> 01:47:19,474
- Where are you going?
- To look for pills in his car.

1306
01:47:52,550 --> 01:47:53,633
Sir...

1307
01:47:54,802 --> 01:47:57,554
Can you hear me? Open your mouth.

1308
01:48:14,405 --> 01:48:16,197
Can you hear me?

1309
01:48:23,706 --> 01:48:25,081
Feeling better?

1310
01:48:29,378 --> 01:48:31,421
Breathe.

1311
01:48:32,798 --> 01:48:34,382
Do you feel better?

1312
01:48:47,563 --> 01:48:48,980
Don't be scared, he's better.

1313
01:48:49,064 --> 01:48:51,107
You didn't call an ambulance?

1314
01:48:53,527 --> 01:48:55,486
No, I was afraid he was dead.

1315
01:49:03,454 --> 01:49:04,662
Wait...

1316
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:11,336
If you talk to his family,
it's over between us.

1317
01:49:27,895 --> 01:49:29,812
The elevator doesn't work.

1318
01:49:30,648 --> 01:49:31,940
Come on, Mother.

1319
01:49:32,024 --> 01:49:35,860
Go ahead. I can't go up quickly,
it's too sore.

1320
01:49:42,368 --> 01:49:43,534
My dear.

1321
01:49:44,912 --> 01:49:46,329
In here.

1322
01:49:57,549 --> 01:49:58,841
Father...

1323
01:50:00,803 --> 01:50:01,928
How are you?

1324
01:50:02,263 --> 01:50:03,805
- Majid...
- Yes, come on.

1325
01:50:03,889 --> 01:50:04,889
Daddy...

1326
01:50:06,141 --> 01:50:08,101
He's fine, thank God.

1327
01:50:08,727 --> 01:50:09,936
You okay, Daddy?

1328
01:50:11,730 --> 01:50:14,649
You look okay. You gave us quite a scare.

1329
01:50:15,651 --> 01:50:16,776
Where's Mom?

1330
01:50:16,860 --> 01:50:19,737
- Coming.
- Majid, tell her not to come up.

1331
01:50:20,572 --> 01:50:21,781
We're going soon.

1332
01:50:21,949 --> 01:50:26,703
Majid, let her come up.
It'll reassure her to see him.

1333
01:50:27,621 --> 01:50:31,207
Good evening. Sorry, in all the
panic we didn't greet you...

1334
01:50:31,834 --> 01:50:33,876
Stay seated, don't get up.

1335
01:50:33,961 --> 01:50:37,088
I want Mom to see you, then we'll go.

1336
01:50:38,215 --> 01:50:41,384
There's no rush.
Let him get his breath back.

1337
01:50:41,593 --> 01:50:43,386
We're very sorry.

1338
01:50:43,846 --> 01:50:45,847
Daddy, stay seated.

1339
01:50:46,348 --> 01:50:47,348
Can you manage?

1340
01:50:47,933 --> 01:50:48,975
Yes, it's okay.

1341
01:50:49,935 --> 01:50:51,019
Sit down.

1342
01:50:51,353 --> 01:50:52,353
Majid...

1343
01:50:52,688 --> 01:50:55,440
Yes, Mother, we're here.

1344
01:50:55,524 --> 01:50:59,068
Luckily, Father is here, safe and sound.

1345
01:50:59,778 --> 01:51:01,404
What's up, Daddy?

1346
01:51:02,364 --> 01:51:03,364
Hmm?

1347
01:51:04,158 --> 01:51:05,825
Nothing, sweetie, it's fine.

1348
01:51:20,549 --> 01:51:23,009
- Mother?
- How is he?

1349
01:51:23,093 --> 01:51:25,053
He's fine.

1350
01:51:32,936 --> 01:51:36,356
I told you not to go.

1351
01:51:41,737 --> 01:51:44,322
See what you do to us.

1352
01:51:45,240 --> 01:51:46,699
My God...

1353
01:51:48,786 --> 01:51:51,329
Thanks be to God...

1354
01:51:51,413 --> 01:51:55,375
I prayed all the way

1355
01:51:55,459 --> 01:51:57,377
to hear his voice again.

1356
01:51:58,420 --> 01:52:00,004
Thanks be to God.

1357
01:52:04,468 --> 01:52:08,679
I told you not to go.
I don't want you working anymore.

1358
01:52:08,764 --> 01:52:10,765
Don't work anymore.

1359
01:52:10,849 --> 01:52:14,394
You said, "It's for Majid,
I'll be back soon. "

1360
01:52:14,478 --> 01:52:16,104
Now look.

1361
01:52:16,188 --> 01:52:19,232
You should thank these people
for helping him.

1362
01:52:19,316 --> 01:52:20,900
He was lucky.

1363
01:52:20,984 --> 01:52:24,070
We don't know how to thank you.

1364
01:52:24,154 --> 01:52:26,697
Thanks so much, madam.

1365
01:52:26,782 --> 01:52:28,074
Excuse us.

1366
01:52:28,158 --> 01:52:31,494
This man is my whole life.
Thank you very much.

1367
01:52:32,037 --> 01:52:34,414
You've given me back my life.

1368
01:52:35,457 --> 01:52:37,208
He's everything to me.

1369
01:52:37,292 --> 01:52:39,419
Stop it, Mom.

1370
01:52:42,131 --> 01:52:43,673
Come on, let's go.

1371
01:52:49,763 --> 01:52:50,763
Sorry.

1372
01:52:54,101 --> 01:52:56,519
Have you got everything?
Your phone?

1373
01:52:57,229 --> 01:52:58,604
The car keys.

1374
01:52:58,939 --> 01:53:02,191
- And his glasses, where are they?
- I've got them.

1375
01:53:02,860 --> 01:53:04,026
Come, I'll give them to you.

1376
01:53:04,570 --> 01:53:06,446
- I'll take them.
- Go on.

1377
01:53:07,322 --> 01:53:09,115
He has to come himself.

1378
01:53:09,950 --> 01:53:11,993
We have an account to settle.

1379
01:53:12,369 --> 01:53:13,369
Come.

1380
01:53:14,204 --> 01:53:15,413
What account?

1381
01:53:15,497 --> 01:53:19,083
You saved his life.

1382
01:53:19,877 --> 01:53:22,587
We gave you so much trouble...

1383
01:53:23,255 --> 01:53:24,797
...you don't owe us anything.

1384
01:53:26,758 --> 01:53:28,301
Please come.

1385
01:53:29,011 --> 01:53:31,471
I can come, if you like.

1386
01:53:31,555 --> 01:53:33,264
No, it should be him.

1387
01:53:33,348 --> 01:53:34,932
Come, please.

1388
01:53:43,734 --> 01:53:45,234
Go on down.

1389
01:53:55,662 --> 01:53:56,871
Majid, leave me.

1390
01:54:43,669 --> 01:54:46,003
How much did you leave the other night?

1391
01:54:49,132 --> 01:54:50,716
How much?

1392
01:54:51,885 --> 01:54:52,885
I didn't count it.

1393
01:56:12,215 --> 01:56:14,008
What's wrong?

1394
01:56:14,968 --> 01:56:16,802
What's wrong with you?

1395
01:56:16,887 --> 01:56:18,471
My God...

1396
01:56:18,555 --> 01:56:21,641
He's not well again.

1397
01:56:21,725 --> 01:56:23,142
What's this?

1398
01:56:24,603 --> 01:56:25,686
Where did that come from?

1399
01:56:26,229 --> 01:56:27,521
Is it your heart, Daddy?

1400
01:56:27,814 --> 01:56:29,732
Take my bag.

1401
01:56:30,651 --> 01:56:32,818
Sit there.

1402
01:56:32,903 --> 01:56:34,904
He's going to sit down.

1403
01:56:34,988 --> 01:56:36,781
It's not good.

1404
01:56:37,491 --> 01:56:39,533
Majid, come quick.

1405
01:56:53,173 --> 01:56:54,590
We're almost there.

1406
01:56:54,675 --> 01:56:56,592
I'm here, dear.

1407
01:56:56,927 --> 01:56:59,011
- Esmat...
- Mother.

1408
01:57:01,139 --> 01:57:02,181
Easy.

1409
01:57:02,265 --> 01:57:03,599
Be careful, Majid.

1410
01:57:03,809 --> 01:57:04,850
Esmat.

1411
01:57:04,935 --> 01:57:07,186
I'm here, dear.

1412
01:57:11,733 --> 01:57:13,025
Stretch his legs out.

1413
01:57:13,110 --> 01:57:15,361
Can you hear me, Daddy?

1414
01:57:19,908 --> 01:57:21,534
Help!

1415
01:57:22,244 --> 01:57:23,411
Can you hear me?

1416
01:57:23,662 --> 01:57:25,162
Where are his pills?

1417
01:57:26,998 --> 01:57:29,500
Search his pockets.

1418
01:57:34,089 --> 01:57:35,756
Breathe.

1419
01:57:35,841 --> 01:57:37,717
See if his pills are upstairs.

1420
01:57:42,305 --> 01:57:43,723
Lie down.

1421
01:57:44,683 --> 01:57:45,891
Wait.

1422
01:57:46,810 --> 01:57:48,018
Madam!

1423
01:57:49,104 --> 01:57:51,647
- What is it?
- Are his pills there?

1424
01:57:52,274 --> 01:57:54,650
He collapsed on the stairs.

1425
01:58:01,450 --> 01:58:04,827
Do a heart massage,
till the ambulance arrives.

1426
01:58:04,911 --> 01:58:07,788
Please, sir, come quick.

1427
01:58:12,335 --> 01:58:13,753
Do what I said.

1428
01:58:13,837 --> 01:58:15,671
Arms straight on the chest.

1429
01:58:15,756 --> 01:58:16,839
Okay.

1430
01:58:18,300 --> 01:58:20,676
Lay him on his back.

1431
01:58:21,470 --> 01:58:23,429
He's on his back.

1432
01:58:23,513 --> 01:58:25,931
One hand on the other,

1433
01:58:26,016 --> 01:58:31,228
on his chest, your arms straight.

1434
01:58:31,313 --> 01:58:34,148
- His face is blue.
- Please, sir!

1435
01:58:34,232 --> 01:58:36,108
If you're tired,

1436
01:58:36,193 --> 01:58:38,527
have someone take over.

1437
01:58:43,325 --> 01:58:44,742
He's not moving.

1438
01:58:45,911 --> 01:58:48,162
No, no reaction.

1439
01:58:48,246 --> 01:58:50,956
- Arms and legs?
- Nothing.

1440
01:58:53,376 --> 01:58:55,503
Should we give him his pills?

1441
01:58:55,587 --> 01:58:57,463
No, nothing.

1442
01:58:57,547 --> 01:58:59,465
Keep doing what I said.

1443
01:58:59,549 --> 01:59:01,967
Arms straight.

1444
01:59:44,302 --> 01:59:46,053
Hurry, please.

1445
01:59:50,225 --> 01:59:52,184
- Where is he?
- Inside.
