3
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:40,832
I’ll be going, sir.

4
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:46,838
I wish you’d stayed to complete your degree.

5
00:00:46,964 --> 00:00:49,716
I know, but I don’t have the money.

6
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:52,719
Just don’t give up your writing.

7
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:55,097
Your stories for the college magazine

8
00:00:55,222 --> 00:00:57,391
about village life were very -

9
00:00:58,642 --> 00:01:00,269
Don’t laugh!

10
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:02,563
It can become a vocation.

11
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:05,899
Of course, not everybody becomes a Sarat Chandra.

12
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:09,569
- Our demands –
- Must be met!

13
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:13,865
Good-bye, sir.

14
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:17,744
Long live the revolution!

35
00:05:58,275 --> 00:05:59,818
Who’s there?

36
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:04,531
Good morning.

37
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:08,118
Good morning. Sit down.

38
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:13,498
Is there any point in sitting down?

39
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:15,709
At least it will rest your legs

40
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,211
after all those stairs.

41
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:23,466
I didn’t climb the stairs so I could rest my legs.

42
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,262
We both know very well

43
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:29,306
why I’m here.

44
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:32,934
I’m going to ask you a simple and direct question,

45
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:36,855
and I’d like a simple and direct answer.

46
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,690
Go ahead.

47
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:41,067
You know today’s date?

48
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,903
The tenth.

49
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,488
How many months’ rent do you owe?

50
00:06:45,614 --> 00:06:47,449
Three.

51
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:49,743
So 21 rupees.

52
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:54,039
Will you pay now while I rest my legs, or must I return later?

53
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:58,168
That’s three questions, not one.

54
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:00,503
That’s not fair.

55
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:05,634
A lot of things aren’t fair, young man.

56
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:09,888
You seem to think I should house you for nothing.

57
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:12,182
Is that fair?

58
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:17,854
Is it fair to use up my electricity in the daytime?

59
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:21,274
You’re an educated man.

60
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:25,278
You have pictures of great men on the wall.

61
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:29,115
But when it comes to the rent, you hem and haw?

62
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,786
That’s a sign of greatness too,
you know.

63
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:39,626
I can’t win a battle of words with you, Apu-babu.

64
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:44,506
I could string together a few choice words too,

65
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:48,551
but they wouldn’t be fit for your young ears.

66
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:53,139
In any case,
I’ll be back this evening.

67
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:55,767
Have the money ready

68
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:58,812
or I look for a new lodger.

69
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:01,272
- Simple and direct.
- Simple and direct.

70
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,653
Excuse me.

71
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,405
Step inside.

72
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:37,035
We’re both “Mr. Ray.”

73
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,412
Hence the confusion.

74
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:47,796
“We are pleased to accept

75
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:51,007
your short story ‘A Man of the Soil’

76
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:54,677
for publication in the next issue of Sahityik. ”

77
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:01,476
Not bad news, I hope.

78
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:03,770
Well, good-bye.

79
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:07,524
Tell me, why don’t you ever get mail?

80
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:11,110
Does no one write to you? Not even a girlfriend?

81
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:14,322
It would be nice to open a love letter by mistake.

82
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:17,283
Really? Just as well.

83
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,120
Put it off as long as you can.

84
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:23,706
Don’t get embroiled in “matrimonetary” complications.

85
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:26,626
I speak from experience.
- Good-bye.

86
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:46,312
HARIMATI ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

87
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:13,631
- One, two, three.
- What do you want?

88
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:17,427
You advertised in the paper for a teacher.

89
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:19,846
Qualifications?

90
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:25,101
- Intermediate degree.
- We want a matriculation degree.

91
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:29,314
But that comes before intermediate!

92
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:31,024
What did the ad say?

93
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:34,110
Well, it did specify matriculation.

94
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,197
Then why harp
on intermediate?

95
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:39,407
What’s the point?

96
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:43,494
Would you work for ten rupees a month? Interm-idiot!

97
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:49,083
Twelve. Your turn.

98
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:54,214
Four, six, eight, ten, twelve.

99
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,265
What do you want?

100
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:09,062
I understand you’re hiring for your pharmaceutical plant.

101
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:11,856
I have a... matriculation degree.

102
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,566
Have a seat.

103
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:23,451
Any experience in labeling?

104
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:28,247
I can learn.

105
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:43,763
Can’t I?

106
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:46,975
All right.
Go through that door

107
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,935
and head straight back.

108
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:52,855
Labeling is on the right. Go have a look first.

109
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:55,608
- Go have a look?
- Go on.

110
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,467
What’s this?

111
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:33,094
Pulu?

112
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,890
- You’re a fine friend.
- Why?

113
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,142
Left student housing without a word!

114
00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:42,895
I’ve been looking for you since 4:00.

115
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,273
- How was I to know you’d -
- Quiet!

116
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:47,942
No one knew where you’d gone.

117
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:50,861
I went to Anil’s. He’d gone to a game.

118
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:53,990
I finally got your address from your private students.

119
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:56,826
Took another half hour to find this place!

120
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:59,412
You laugh?
You should be ashamed!

121
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:03,416
- You’ve gotten fat.
- I was fat three hours ago.

122
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:06,043
- How about some tea?
- Where?

123
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:07,920
- A restaurant.
- Is it far?

124
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,922
Around the corner.

125
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,340
All right.

126
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:15,386
But we have tickets to see A Widow’s Fast.

127
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:17,263
Give me a minute.

128
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:23,519
Why have you been hiding out up here?

129
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:26,981
You making counterfeit money? -1 wish I could.

130
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,610
An oil cooker!
Doing your own cooking?

131
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:33,112
Yeah.
I’ll cook for you sometime.

132
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:35,239
Rice and boiled potatoes.

133
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,589
What about that railway job?1

134
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,967
I was sure you’d gotten it.

135
00:18:57,636 --> 00:19:01,807
There was a strike on.
They were hiring strike-breakers.

136
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:05,770
I didn’t know.

137
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:09,482
- So you’ve been unemployed?
- I do some tutoring.

138
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:13,277
Turning dullards into prodigies.
- What’s it pay?

139
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:15,363
Fifteen rupees a month.

140
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:25,456
- Didn’t you learn to type?
- Yeah, in case of emergency.

141
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:28,668
Good. I’ll get you a job when we get back.

142
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:31,962
I know of a firm.
- Get back? From where?

143
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:37,468
My cousin’s getting married on Monday.

144
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,679
You have to come.

145
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:41,639
- Where?
- Just for a few days.

146
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:44,475
- But where?
- Khulna.

147
00:19:44,642 --> 00:19:47,144
Khulna? Are you crazy?

148
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,523
You’ll love it there.

149
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,400
A rustic village.

150
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:55,194
Boats floating down the river.

151
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:58,531
Endless fields of grass and rice.

152
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:01,826
Paths winding through bamboo groves

153
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:05,246
and mango orchards. What do you say?

154
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:08,916
And trees full of birds:

155
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:12,128
magpies, bulbuls, nightingales.

156
00:20:12,253 --> 00:20:15,214
And at nightfall, crickets and fireflies,

157
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:17,508
jackals, and kerosene lamps.

158
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,135
No electricity!

159
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:22,179
Tempting?
Have I hit a weak spot?

160
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:27,351
So you’ll come, right?

161
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:32,440
“Take me back into thy lap, O Mother Earth.

162
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:37,737
Take back thy child and swathe him in thine ample sari.

163
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:43,826
Let me be one with thy soil and spread myself

164
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:49,415
far and wide, like the joys of spring.

165
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,668
Let me burst open the heart’s narrow cage,

166
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:55,713
break down the stone walls of self

167
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:59,133
and the dark and cheerless prison of the mind,

168
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:02,261
surging, billowing, trembling,

169
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:06,098
rushing forth, radiating, shivering

170
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:08,350
Police!

171
00:21:08,476 --> 00:21:10,102
Who’s there?

172
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:13,481
It is I, Mainak, son of the Himalayas,

173
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:17,902
hiding my wings in the sea.

174
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:20,154
What’s come over you?

175
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:24,408
You sound like Nimchand in the play we saw - only sober!

176
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:26,785
- Know what?
- What?

177
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:30,122
- I’m not taking that job.
- What job?

178
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:32,958
- The one you mentioned.
- You taking to the stage?

179
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,169
- Don’t be silly.
- Then why?

180
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:38,047
Why should I be a clerk?

181
00:21:38,172 --> 00:21:40,007
There’s no reason.

182
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:45,054
I’m a free man -no ties, no responsibilities,

183
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:48,265
no one to worry about. Why be a clerk?

184
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:51,268
You can’t keep pawning books to pay the rent!

185
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:54,271
- Things will improve.
- With no income?

186
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:57,691
Those with genuine talent -

187
00:21:57,817 --> 00:22:00,653
Don’t need to earn a living?

188
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:11,163
Apurba Kumar Ray.

189
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:14,291
Laugh if you like. Just wait and see.

190
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:18,087
Are you writing anything? Any new poems?

191
00:22:18,212 --> 00:22:20,214
You’re such a philistine.

192
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,715
A philistine?

193
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:24,176
Engineering is all you know.

194
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:26,887
You’ll go abroad and get your degree,

195
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:31,308
then settle down here with a nice fat salary. Bah!

196
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:33,894
- So I’m a philistine?
- That’s right.

197
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:36,939
Who made you read A Widow’s Fast?

198
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:41,360
You were a country bumpkin...
- Was it you?

199
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:45,656
who’d break out in a sweat crossing the street in the big city!

200
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:49,869
You remember who read your first short story

201
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:52,371
and what he said about it?

202
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:57,626
Sorry’s too easy!
- Don’t get so worked up.

203
00:22:57,835 --> 00:23:02,298
I’m just excited tonight, that’s all.

204
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:06,927
I’ve had my first good meal in months, thanks to you.

205
00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:11,473
So are you writing anything?

206
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:13,893
What are you writing?

207
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:17,855
A wonderful novel.

208
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:21,025
And you’ve kept it mum all this time?

209
00:23:22,026 --> 00:23:25,404
- You know a good publisher?
- All in good time.

210
00:23:25,613 --> 00:23:27,197
Listen to this:

211
00:23:27,698 --> 00:23:29,533
a young boy.

212
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:31,744
A young boy.

213
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:33,412
All right.

214
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:35,706
A village boy.

215
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:37,333
Poor...

216
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:40,169
but sensitive.

217
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:43,714
His father’s a priest.

218
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:45,758
The father dies.

219
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:47,927
The boy comes to the city.

220
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:52,139
He doesn’t want to be a priest. He’ll study. He’s ambitious.

221
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:55,809
He studies.

222
00:23:56,935 --> 00:24:00,940
Through his education and struggles,

223
00:24:01,315 --> 00:24:03,442
we watch as he sheds

224
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:06,236
his old superstitions and fixed views.

225
00:24:06,362 --> 00:24:09,448
He questions everything and takes nothing on trust.

226
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:13,327
Yet he has imagination and sensitivity.

227
00:24:13,911 --> 00:24:18,248
Little things move him and bring him joy.

228
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:22,044
Perhaps he has greatness in him,

229
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:24,296
the ability to create, but -

230
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:26,548
- He doesn’t make it.
- That’s right.

231
00:24:26,674 --> 00:24:29,551
But it doesn’t end there. It’s not a tragedy.

232
00:24:29,677 --> 00:24:33,722
He does nothing great. He remains poor, in want.

233
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:37,810
But he never turns away from life.

234
00:24:37,935 --> 00:24:40,729
He doesn’t run away. He wants to live.

235
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:44,858
He says living itself brings fulfillment and joy.

236
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:48,612
- What’s that mean?
- This is autobiography.

237
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:50,864
Partly, but a lot is fiction.

238
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:53,075
There are fictional characters,

239
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,994
a plot, a love interest -

240
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:58,497
Love?

241
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:01,250
What do you know about love?

242
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:05,337
You’ve never been within ten yards of a girl!

243
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:08,507
You have any experience of love?
- What if I don’t?

244
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:11,427
Oh, great!
You’ll just make it up?

245
00:25:11,552 --> 00:25:13,971
- You have to experience everything?
- Absolutely!

246
00:25:14,096 --> 00:25:16,348
Is imagination worth nothing?.

247
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:18,559
Not with love!

248
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:20,436
- Who says so?
- I do!

249
00:25:20,561 --> 00:25:23,564
Rubbish!
If a man has talent...

250
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:26,752
“How much further wilt thou lead me, O fair one?

251
00:26:26,877 --> 00:26:30,589
Tell me which shore thy golden boat will touch.

252
00:26:30,881 --> 00:26:33,675
Whatever I ask thee,
O thou from distant lands,

253
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:37,471
thou only smilest in thine own sweet way,

254
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:40,766
and I can never know what is in thy mind.

255
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:44,061
Silently thou liftest a finger

256
00:26:44,186 --> 00:26:46,855
and pointest to the wild, trackless sea

257
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:50,901
as, far to the west, the sun sinks in the sky.

258
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:55,739
What lies there? What do we go to seek?

259
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:59,451
Tell me, I pray thee,
O stranger fair,

260
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:03,372
where, at the edge of evening, glows the day

261
00:27:08,544 --> 00:27:10,045
What?

262
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:13,048
- Give me your hand.
- You finished?

263
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:15,384
Well?
- Your hand, idiot!

264
00:27:18,137 --> 00:27:21,098
Wonderful! Really wonderful!

265
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:38,448
Look who’s here!

266
00:27:38,574 --> 00:27:42,244
It’s Pulu - with company!

267
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:45,289
I hope your journey wasn’t too unpleasant.

268
00:27:45,414 --> 00:27:48,834
After all, you’re city people. We’re just country folk.

269
00:27:49,126 --> 00:27:52,254
My youngest son, Murari.

270
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:55,632
He’s in the intermediate class at Daulatpur College.

271
00:27:55,966 --> 00:27:58,844
Take his luggage.

272
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:01,638
Harey, come here!

273
00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:09,980
How are you, my child?

274
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:12,482
My aunt.

275
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:18,363
Here I had a fine match for your daughter,

276
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:20,407
but you looked elsewhere.

277
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:23,035
Where have I seen that face before?

278
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,746
Impossible.
He’s never been here before.

279
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:29,291
No, I know that face very well.

280
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:31,543
Oh, I know!

281
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:35,213
I’ve seen it many times in a painting of the gods!

282
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,341
Lord Krishna incarnate,

283
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:39,635
complete with flute.

284
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:44,848
Bless you, my son.

285
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:47,517
A long life to you.

286
00:30:42,049 --> 00:30:43,800
The groom!

287
00:31:12,621 --> 00:31:15,874
Binu, my son, come out now.

288
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:31,056
What’s wrong? Isn’t he well?

289
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:34,226
He’s been under the hot sun all afternoon.

290
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:37,229
- I’ll get some water.
- Please do.

291
00:31:37,396 --> 00:31:39,856
What’s going on?

292
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:42,567
I think he’s probably ill

293
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:45,112
from the long journey

294
00:31:45,237 --> 00:31:47,405
and fasting all day.

295
00:31:47,531 --> 00:31:49,533
Some water and a fan -

296
00:31:49,658 --> 00:31:52,786
Bring water and a fan!

297
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:04,464
Stop crowding him!

298
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:22,107
Who are you giving her away to?

299
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:24,317
What do you mean?

300
00:32:24,818 --> 00:32:27,654
The groom is mad!

301
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,531
Who told you that?

302
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:33,702
He’s perfectly sane.
It’s just the journey in this heat -

303
00:32:33,827 --> 00:32:37,622
I won’t allow this wedding to take place!

304
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:40,792
Are you mad?
The auspicious hour is passing.

305
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:43,253
Leave this room or I’ll kill myself!

306
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:45,630
You’ve lost your senses!

307
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:48,633
I said leave!

308
00:32:51,136 --> 00:32:53,430
Wife...

309
00:32:53,847 --> 00:32:58,018
if the auspicious hour passes, my daughter will never marry.

310
00:33:01,188 --> 00:33:03,356
She won’t open.

311
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:06,693
What a calamity!

312
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:10,572
Isn’t there another auspicious hour at 10:00 p.m.?

313
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:12,532
I don’t know.

314
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:14,826
I can’t think clearly.

315
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:16,870
I’m ruined!

316
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:18,830
What a calamity!

317
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:35,055
What?

318
00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:39,851
- Did I miss it?
- It’s not happening.

319
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:42,812
- What?
- There’ll be no wedding.

320
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:45,315
What happened?;

321
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:47,817
The groom is mad.

322
00:33:48,902 --> 00:33:50,487
Listen to me.

323
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:57,369
Apu, everything depends on you now.

324
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:00,455
On me?

325
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,583
Are you joking?

326
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:09,130
What is all this?

327
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:15,220
Only you can save us. You know the custom here.

328
00:34:15,345 --> 00:34:18,098
In the morning the girl will be unfit for marriage.

329
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:19,766
What can I do?

330
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:24,562
Where could we find a more suitable choice tonight?

331
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:26,565
So if you’d -

332
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:37,284
This is what you came to tell me?

333
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:39,369
Listen.

334
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:44,165
What is this?
Some kind of play or novel?

335
00:34:44,708 --> 00:34:48,420
You’d stick me in the groom’s seat just like that?

336
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:50,630
Are you still in the Dark Ages?

337
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:57,178
- Will you calm down and listen?
- No.

338
00:34:57,304 --> 00:35:00,390
I won’t listen to this lunacy. It’s a waste of time.

339
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:02,684
Everything depends on you.

340
00:35:02,851 --> 00:35:05,603
Let’s go, Majumdar-babu.

341
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:55,987
If I’d known this would happen, I’d never have come.

342
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:58,573
Am I not getting married?

343
00:36:38,488 --> 00:36:41,199
- What?
- I need to talk to you.

344
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:53,378
What?

345
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:01,636
- Can you really get me that job?
- Why?

346
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:08,184
I don’t have a good shirt...

347
00:37:09,853 --> 00:37:12,147
and I haven’t even shaved.

348
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:18,570
Uncle!

349
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:03,281
The curse turned into a blessing.

350
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:06,534
Your daughter hasn’t worshipped Shiva in vain.

351
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:08,745
And what a blessing!

352
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:11,456
The moment I saw him,

353
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:16,127
I felt he was nearer to me than my own kin.

354
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:20,715
Pulu has brought many friends here,

355
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:24,719
but none has ever cast such a spell.

356
00:38:27,472 --> 00:38:31,059
0 my friend

357
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:38,066
Don’t go down to the river to fill your pitcher

358
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:46,699
For if the handsome Krishna
finds you

359
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:52,080
He won’t let you go

360
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:57,835
O my friend

361
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:10,265
Had I known, dearest friend.

362
00:39:10,557 --> 00:39:15,019
That you’d abandon me

363
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:19,566
I’d have kept you

364
00:39:19,816 --> 00:39:23,361
Tied to my sari...

365
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:32,537
Aparna.

366
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:41,963
There are a few things I have to tell you.

367
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:48,720
I’ve had no chance the last two days.

368
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:56,894
Just how much do you know about me?

369
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:02,317
Has Pulu said anything?

370
00:40:02,734 --> 00:40:04,360
Yes.

371
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:07,322
What did he say?

372
00:40:09,699 --> 00:40:11,618
That you have no one.

373
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,080
That’s right.

374
00:40:17,624 --> 00:40:20,251
My father died when I was ten.

375
00:40:21,294 --> 00:40:23,922
Mother died seven years later.

376
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:29,135
I had an older sister too.

377
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:40,063
What else did he tell you?

378
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:42,523
That you write well.

379
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:45,777
He said that, did he? Good old Pulu.

380
00:40:47,028 --> 00:40:50,365
Tell me:
Do you know how to read?

381
00:40:50,782 --> 00:40:53,117
Yes. Bengali.

382
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:58,039
I’m writing a novel in Bengali.

383
00:40:58,247 --> 00:41:00,667
- I know.
- You know that too?

384
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:03,252
What else did he say?

385
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:05,880
Nothing.

386
00:41:06,923 --> 00:41:08,925
Then he didn’t tell you much.

387
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:11,010
Not what really matters.

388
00:41:12,762 --> 00:41:15,640
You don’t even know whom you’ve married.

389
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:21,479
Imagine, newlyweds spending their third night in her home!

390
00:41:22,647 --> 00:41:25,525
I have no house of my own, nothing.

391
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:28,820
No home, no hearth, no income.

392
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:30,822
No future.

393
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:36,160
What kind of life am I offering you?

394
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:38,788
And the way you’ve been brought up -

395
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:41,666
this spacious house, servants,

396
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:43,876
beautiful rooms.

397
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:47,255
This marriage was forced on me.

398
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,882
I was very much against it.

399
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:51,926
But...

400
00:41:54,262 --> 00:41:57,014
the request was made in such a way

401
00:41:57,181 --> 00:42:00,518
that I felt I’d be doing something noble.

402
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:06,315
Everything got all confused.

403
00:42:08,443 --> 00:42:10,028
Well?

404
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:14,282
Why don’t you say something?

405
00:42:14,407 --> 00:42:18,536
I can’t decide anything until I know what you think.

406
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:21,956
Aparna...

407
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:26,878
will you be able to endure being poor?

408
00:42:29,714 --> 00:42:31,424
Can you live...

409
00:42:32,592 --> 00:42:35,845
with a poor man like me for a husband?

410
00:42:40,433 --> 00:42:41,601
Yes.

411
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:53,404
You mean it?

412
00:42:55,782 --> 00:42:57,742
Why not?

413
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:10,254
Then I’ll take you away with me.

414
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:13,758
Your father may object, but I won’t listen.

415
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:17,929
Sure you won’t object?
- I don’t know.

416
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:24,018
- What will they think?
- Who?

417
00:43:24,185 --> 00:43:25,937
My neighbors.

418
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:28,606
I’m invited to a wedding...

419
00:43:28,773 --> 00:43:31,526
and I come home with the bride!

420
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:07,019
Bring the luggage down. I’ll be back.

421
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:35,566
Come in.

422
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:42,448
My room.

423
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:45,159
Give me that.

424
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:01,259
Sit down.
I’ll be right back.

425
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:35,704
You must be very sad.

426
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:40,292
Are you sure?

427
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:48,259
Come.
Let’s go downstairs.

428
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:51,387
Is that so?

429
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:55,266
Make way. Stop crowding.

430
00:48:55,391 --> 00:48:56,976
Let me see.

431
00:48:57,101 --> 00:48:59,270
Oh, my!

432
00:48:59,728 --> 00:49:01,689
Out of the way!

433
00:49:01,856 --> 00:49:04,400
Let them come down!

434
00:50:52,007 --> 00:50:54,510
What are you staring at? Am I new here?

435
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:10,859
“Just one - after a meal. You promised.”

436
00:53:04,682 --> 00:53:06,308
Let me by.

437
00:54:02,948 --> 00:54:05,409
Do you lament your decision?

438
00:54:05,576 --> 00:54:09,663
Do I what? I don’t understand such difficult words.

439
00:54:10,581 --> 00:54:13,083
You understand “regret”?

440
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:14,543
Yes.

441
00:54:14,668 --> 00:54:17,129
- Do you regret it?
- Regret what?

442
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:19,423
- I have to explain that too?
- Yes.

443
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:23,761
You regret missing out on a rich husband?

444
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:28,015
You’re laughing?
- No, I’m crying.

445
00:54:40,194 --> 00:54:43,238
I’m sure you regret it. You just won’t tell me.

446
00:54:43,781 --> 00:54:45,449
Of course.

447
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:48,577
I could have sat back and relaxed.

448
00:54:57,795 --> 00:54:59,379
I’m going out.

449
00:54:59,505 --> 00:55:01,590
- Where?
- To find you a maid.

450
00:55:01,715 --> 00:55:03,383
Wait.

451
00:55:04,218 --> 00:55:06,887
Don’t be childish. Come back.

452
00:55:12,184 --> 00:55:13,977
Let me by.

453
00:55:33,664 --> 00:55:36,166
Who’ll pay the maid’s wages?

454
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:39,127
I’ll do more tutoring.

455
00:55:45,634 --> 00:55:48,345
Then send me back to my parents.

456
00:55:48,595 --> 00:55:50,389
Why?

457
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:54,518
You get home late as it is

458
00:55:54,685 --> 00:55:57,312
tutoring one student after work.

459
00:55:57,437 --> 00:56:00,774
If you take on another –
- What else can I do?

460
00:56:03,777 --> 00:56:05,696
Shall I tell you?

461
00:56:05,863 --> 00:56:09,157
Give up the student you have now.

462
00:56:10,701 --> 00:56:12,536
Then what?

463
00:56:13,495 --> 00:56:17,791
Then my poor husband will come home early...

464
00:56:22,713 --> 00:56:25,716
and I’ll have nothing more to lament.

465
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:18,245
Go on.

466
00:58:36,722 --> 00:58:39,182
O Lord Vishnu...

467
00:59:15,802 --> 00:59:19,639
God of fire, use your powers to shatter his meditation!

468
00:59:39,201 --> 00:59:40,744
What’s wrong?

469
00:59:41,995 --> 00:59:43,747
Are you mad?

470
00:59:44,039 --> 00:59:47,125
Or sad?
Or just in a huff?

471
00:59:47,876 --> 00:59:50,337
- Mad.
- Why?

472
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:52,798
Can’t I ride in a bus?

473
00:59:53,882 --> 00:59:57,302
Buses are so crowded. Here we can be alone.

474
00:59:57,928 --> 00:59:59,930
But it costs so much.

475
01:00:00,096 --> 01:00:02,390
- Just seven annas.
- That’s a lot.

476
01:00:04,101 --> 01:00:06,728
You’ll be leaving for your parents’ soon.

477
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:09,940
My expenses will be cut in half.

478
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:12,275
Just for two months.

479
01:00:13,652 --> 01:00:16,154
Is that so short?

480
01:00:17,572 --> 01:00:20,992
What about the extra expenses when we come back?

481
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:28,124
Ah, yes.

482
01:00:30,502 --> 01:00:32,254
You know...

483
01:00:34,089 --> 01:00:37,801
I didn’t want to let you go...

484
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:41,805
but your mother insisted, and I thought

485
01:00:41,972 --> 01:00:44,015
at a time like this you’d rather -

486
01:00:44,141 --> 01:00:48,353
It’ll be a relief for you too.
No one to bother you for two months.

487
01:00:49,729 --> 01:00:51,356
Don’t say that.

488
01:00:51,815 --> 01:00:54,568
But I will get some work done on my novel.

489
01:00:54,693 --> 01:00:56,862
haven’t written a line

490
01:00:57,821 --> 01:00:59,698
since we were married.

491
01:01:00,073 --> 01:01:01,616
Is that my fault?

492
01:01:06,204 --> 01:01:08,206
It’s to your credit.

493
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:11,710
You know how much my novel means to me.

494
01:01:11,835 --> 01:01:14,087
You mean much more.
- Really?

495
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:19,968
- I’ll dedicate it to you.
- You’ll what?

496
01:01:22,554 --> 01:01:25,348
I know what “wife” means.

497
01:01:29,811 --> 01:01:33,189
No, you don’t. But I do.

498
01:01:33,648 --> 01:01:35,650
I do too.

499
01:01:45,493 --> 01:01:46,912
What?

500
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:48,747
The matches.

501
01:02:09,059 --> 01:02:10,810
Tell me...

502
01:02:11,353 --> 01:02:14,522
what’s that in your eyes?

503
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:19,611
Kohl.

504
01:02:32,916 --> 01:02:35,126
Will you come for the puja festival?

505
01:02:35,252 --> 01:02:37,837
I hope to.
Wire me when you arrive.

506
01:02:37,963 --> 01:02:40,548
Letters take too long. Go on now.

507
01:03:02,153 --> 01:03:05,657
- Will you come?
- Have I ever broken a promise?

508
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:07,951
Write me twice a week.

509
01:03:08,118 --> 01:03:10,578
- Will you write too?
- Not unless you do.

510
01:03:10,745 --> 01:03:14,290
Write to my office, or Mr. Ray will open your letters.

511
01:03:14,416 --> 01:03:17,419
Listen –
Oh, I’m forgetting everything!

512
01:03:17,544 --> 01:03:20,964
Pintu’s mother is making pudding for you.

513
01:03:21,131 --> 01:03:24,301
And we owe the grocer money.

514
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:27,971
I left some jewelry behind. Keep it safe, will you?

515
01:03:28,138 --> 01:03:30,640
Please take care of yourself.

516
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:34,412
My friend.

517
01:04:49,594 --> 01:04:53,389
You’ll see her in a few days, so why worry?

518
01:04:53,598 --> 01:04:55,433
I’m not worrying.

519
01:05:01,815 --> 01:05:04,692
I wish I knew your secret.

520
01:05:05,944 --> 01:05:08,905
How to be happy and married in these hard times

521
01:05:09,030 --> 01:05:11,282
on a clerk’s 45 rupees a month.

522
01:05:11,407 --> 01:05:13,743
How do you know I’m happy?

523
01:05:14,369 --> 01:05:15,954
I know.

524
01:05:32,554 --> 01:05:35,348
I don’t know what your wife is like,

525
01:05:35,473 --> 01:05:38,226
but mine -

526
01:05:39,018 --> 01:05:42,814
I mean,
I like them a little feisty.

527
01:05:42,939 --> 01:05:45,191
I like them to be a little quarrelsome,

528
01:05:45,442 --> 01:05:48,069
a little saucy.

529
01:05:49,070 --> 01:05:50,947
Know what I mean?

530
01:05:51,114 --> 01:05:54,701
I like them a bit mischievous and smart.

531
01:05:54,826 --> 01:05:56,953
It adds spice to a marriage.

532
01:05:58,121 --> 01:06:01,416
My wife’s just the opposite.
- Really?

533
01:06:01,624 --> 01:06:03,585
Never quarrels.

534
01:06:03,710 --> 01:06:06,129
Nothing for dinner? She won’t say a word.

535
01:06:06,296 --> 01:06:07,964
Nothing to wear? She won’t complain.

536
01:06:08,131 --> 01:06:11,342
Say right, she goes right. Say left, she goes left.

537
01:06:12,010 --> 01:06:15,555
Utterly bland and insipid.

538
01:06:20,977 --> 01:06:23,771
And to top it all off...

539
01:06:35,158 --> 01:06:37,911
You promised to come on the eighth day of the festival.

540
01:06:38,036 --> 01:06:39,829
I’ll be waiting.

541
01:06:39,954 --> 01:06:44,042
If you don’t come,
I’ll never ever speak to you again.

542
01:06:44,209 --> 01:06:46,252
You’re a big liar.

543
01:06:46,502 --> 01:06:49,130
You only wrote me seven letters last month.

544
01:06:49,255 --> 01:06:51,549
It should have been eight.

545
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:55,345
You really don’t keep your promises.

546
01:06:55,553 --> 01:06:59,349
I’ve been counting the days, and if you don’t come -

547
01:06:59,515 --> 01:07:02,393
Let’s go, my friend. Come on.

548
01:07:34,008 --> 01:07:37,220
And I feel jealous of that girl next door.

549
01:07:37,387 --> 01:07:39,222
You know why?

550
01:07:39,389 --> 01:07:43,142
She sees you morning and evening, and I don’t.

551
01:07:43,393 --> 01:07:45,061
It’s quite unfair.

552
01:07:45,228 --> 01:07:47,480
Do keep that window shut.

553
01:08:34,444 --> 01:08:37,947
What else is there to write? That’s all for now.

554
01:08:38,072 --> 01:08:40,575
I’ve misspelled lots of words.

555
01:08:40,825 --> 01:08:44,245
I know you’ll laugh. Go ahead.

556
01:08:44,370 --> 01:08:46,331
I’m no novelist -

557
01:08:46,456 --> 01:08:48,875
just good enough for a letter.

558
01:08:49,167 --> 01:08:51,753
Take good care of yourself.

559
01:08:52,086 --> 01:08:56,841
I’m well, but my heart is sick. It will heal when you come.

560
01:08:57,050 --> 01:08:58,593
If you don’t...

561
01:08:58,718 --> 01:09:01,971
I’ll never speak to you ever ever again...

562
01:09:45,515 --> 01:09:47,683
- How are things?
- Fine, thanks.

563
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:50,061
- And the family?
- Just fine.

564
01:10:06,577 --> 01:10:08,246
What is it?

565
01:10:13,376 --> 01:10:14,669
Murari?

566
01:10:20,842 --> 01:10:22,009
What is it?

567
01:10:24,721 --> 01:10:26,431
Aparna...

568
01:10:27,098 --> 01:10:29,350
What’s happened to her?

569
01:10:31,978 --> 01:10:34,021
In childbirth...

570
01:10:34,439 --> 01:10:35,940
What?

571
01:12:09,742 --> 01:12:12,286
She told me just the other day,

572
01:12:12,411 --> 01:12:15,540
“Ma’am, I’m leaving him in your care.

573
01:12:15,873 --> 01:12:19,961
He’s so absent-minded and gets lost in his writing.

574
01:12:20,169 --> 01:12:24,090
He might forget to eat at night.”

575
01:12:25,132 --> 01:12:28,803
Such gentle ways she had,

576
01:12:28,928 --> 01:12:31,514
and so good-natured.

577
01:12:33,015 --> 01:12:36,561
She suddenly appeared and just as suddenly -

578
01:12:37,186 --> 01:12:40,106
Well, it’s a good thing the child was saved.

579
01:12:40,314 --> 01:12:44,151
Everyone has their sorrow and suffering, my son.

580
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:47,405
But a man mustn’t break down like this.

581
01:12:47,655 --> 01:12:50,074
Besides, you’re still young.

582
01:12:50,283 --> 01:12:53,619
“While Krishna has his knot of hair and his flute,

583
01:12:53,744 --> 01:12:56,455
there’ll be women to serve him.”

584
01:12:56,664 --> 01:12:58,791
You could marry ten times over

585
01:12:58,916 --> 01:13:01,210
You have nothing to worry about.

586
01:15:57,136 --> 01:15:59,346
“Dear Pulu, you must have heard the news by now.

587
01:15:59,513 --> 01:16:03,768
I hear you’re going abroad. I wish you success.

588
01:16:03,893 --> 01:16:07,104
I’m going away too.

589
01:16:07,271 --> 01:16:11,567
I don’t know where I’m going, but I do know why.

590
01:16:11,734 --> 01:16:14,695
I want to be free.

591
01:16:14,904 --> 01:16:18,074
I’m taking my manuscript with me.

592
01:16:18,282 --> 01:16:21,744
I’ll send it to you if I finish it.

593
01:16:21,911 --> 01:16:25,039
You may publish it if you see fit.

594
01:16:25,164 --> 01:16:27,333
Yours, Apu”

595
01:22:55,762 --> 01:22:56,972
Oh!

596
01:22:58,557 --> 01:23:01,768
What did you drop there?;

597
01:23:01,894 --> 01:23:04,146
All my food’s ruined!

598
01:23:11,278 --> 01:23:15,073
I’ll show you! Stealing at your age, eh?

599
01:23:15,199 --> 01:23:17,117
Ouch!

600
01:23:18,410 --> 01:23:21,497
Almost bit my arm off, the little beast!

601
01:23:21,622 --> 01:23:25,709
Want me to tell the master? Know what will happen?

602
01:23:25,834 --> 01:23:29,880
You know what will happen?
- You’ll tell Grandfather?

603
01:23:30,130 --> 01:23:34,051
A good thrashing will teach you a lesson!

604
01:23:35,010 --> 01:23:37,012
He’ll beat you up.

605
01:23:38,347 --> 01:23:41,350
Who’ll beat me up?

606
01:23:42,267 --> 01:23:45,646
My father.
He lives in Calcutta.

607
01:23:45,896 --> 01:23:49,024
Your father lives in Calcutta!
So what?

608
01:23:49,191 --> 01:23:51,985
Should I tremble in fear?

609
01:23:52,778 --> 01:23:54,905
He lives in Calcutta!

610
01:23:55,030 --> 01:23:58,325
We haven’t seen his pigtail these last five years!

611
01:23:58,450 --> 01:24:00,535
Your father indeed!

612
01:24:00,744 --> 01:24:03,038
Beat me up, will he?

613
01:24:05,082 --> 01:24:07,751
Do fathers have pigtails?

614
01:24:13,131 --> 01:24:15,551
In five years

615
01:24:15,676 --> 01:24:20,013
he hasn’t shown up even once to see his own son.

616
01:24:20,722 --> 01:24:22,933
Have you ever heard of such a thing?

617
01:24:23,058 --> 01:24:25,394
Thinks he’s done his duty

618
01:24:25,561 --> 01:24:28,063
by sending a money order now and then.

619
01:24:28,230 --> 01:24:30,315
Do you know where he is?

620
01:24:30,899 --> 01:24:33,902
I was dead set against the marriage.

621
01:24:34,361 --> 01:24:37,948
It was you and your aunt

622
01:24:38,073 --> 01:24:40,784
who took my daughter and -

623
01:24:41,118 --> 01:24:44,830
- Do you know where Apu is?
- What good would it do?

624
01:24:44,955 --> 01:24:46,498
Please tell me.

625
01:24:46,623 --> 01:24:50,085
In Nagpur or somewhere, working in a coal mine,

626
01:24:50,252 --> 01:24:52,421
the good-for-nothing vagabond.

627
01:24:52,546 --> 01:24:55,048
AndJhe boy’s just like him,

628
01:24:55,173 --> 01:24:58,802
always running around and getting into mischief.

629
01:24:58,927 --> 01:25:02,431
The other day he broke my marble tumbler.

630
01:25:02,556 --> 01:25:05,767
When your aunt was alive she could manage him,

631
01:25:05,934 --> 01:25:09,604
but now, with my failing health -

632
01:25:10,230 --> 01:25:12,357
Do you have Apu’s address?

633
01:25:12,482 --> 01:25:14,526
Whatever’s on his letter.

634
01:25:14,651 --> 01:25:16,945
But what good is that?

635
01:25:17,112 --> 01:25:19,656
Think you can bring him back?

636
01:25:21,116 --> 01:25:23,952
He hasn’t even come back for his own child,

637
01:25:24,119 --> 01:25:25,996
the heartless brute!

638
01:27:34,749 --> 01:27:36,585
You?

639
01:27:37,377 --> 01:27:39,421
When did you get back?

640
01:27:40,422 --> 01:27:43,425
I went looking for you at my uncle’s place.

641
01:27:49,306 --> 01:27:51,516
What are you doing here?

642
01:27:52,434 --> 01:27:54,102
Working.

643
01:27:54,728 --> 01:27:56,438
Since when?

644
01:27:57,105 --> 01:27:58,899
About a year.

645
01:27:59,149 --> 01:28:01,359
All the way out here?

646
01:28:01,943 --> 01:28:05,822
- I didn’t come here for a job.
- Then why?

647
01:28:06,490 --> 01:28:09,409
I just ended up here as I wandered around.

648
01:28:09,534 --> 01:28:11,244
And?

649
01:28:12,204 --> 01:28:14,164
I had to fill my belly.

650
01:28:14,289 --> 01:28:16,249
And have you?

651
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:18,543
More or less.

652
01:28:18,668 --> 01:28:21,796
How’s everything else? How’s the writing?

653
01:28:23,048 --> 01:28:25,050
How’s the novel coming?

654
01:28:26,384 --> 01:28:28,136
I threw it away.

655
01:28:28,261 --> 01:28:30,347
What? Why?

656
01:28:31,973 --> 01:28:33,892
What’s the use?

657
01:28:37,103 --> 01:28:38,813
Come on.

658
01:28:43,902 --> 01:28:45,987
You planning to stay here?

659
01:28:46,404 --> 01:28:48,824
- No.
- Then what?

660
01:28:49,825 --> 01:28:53,286
I’m thinking of going away. I’m not happy here.

661
01:28:53,411 --> 01:28:55,288
Where would you go?

662
01:28:55,413 --> 01:28:57,165
Maybe abroad.

663
01:28:57,457 --> 01:28:59,543
I’m saving up.

664
01:29:01,628 --> 01:29:03,380
By yourself?

665
01:29:03,505 --> 01:29:05,757
- Who else is there?
- Kajal.

666
01:29:05,882 --> 01:29:07,759
- Who?
- Kajal.

667
01:29:08,677 --> 01:29:10,387
Your son.

668
01:29:16,935 --> 01:29:19,187
So that’s his name, is it?

669
01:29:25,485 --> 01:29:27,237
Listen to me.

670
01:29:37,581 --> 01:29:39,165
What?

671
01:29:40,876 --> 01:29:42,877
Go back home.

672
01:29:43,086 --> 01:29:44,588
Why?

673
01:29:44,963 --> 01:29:47,632
The boy needs someone to look after him.

674
01:29:48,550 --> 01:29:50,677
He has no one to do that.

675
01:29:50,927 --> 01:29:54,723
There’s such a thing as a father’s duty,

676
01:29:54,973 --> 01:29:57,392
or did you throw that away too?

677
01:29:57,517 --> 01:30:00,520
Who says I don’t do my duty?

678
01:30:00,645 --> 01:30:02,439
I send money, don’t I?

679
01:30:02,564 --> 01:30:05,900
- Is that it?
- I can’t do any more.

680
01:30:17,370 --> 01:30:18,997
What are you saying?

681
01:30:19,122 --> 01:30:21,750
Have you no feelings for your own son?

682
01:30:21,917 --> 01:30:23,460
No.

683
01:30:34,429 --> 01:30:36,723
How can I feel anything for him?

684
01:30:37,182 --> 01:30:39,184
I’ve never even seen him.

685
01:30:39,809 --> 01:30:43,313
To me he’s unreal, imaginary.

686
01:30:44,356 --> 01:30:46,775
For me he doesn’t exist.

687
01:30:50,403 --> 01:30:52,614
You’ve lost your senses.

688
01:31:00,121 --> 01:31:02,248
I’ve done my duty.

689
01:31:02,958 --> 01:31:05,126
Do as you see fit.

690
01:31:05,794 --> 01:31:07,170
Good-bye.

691
01:31:16,012 --> 01:31:18,390
- What?
- Wait.

692
01:31:19,474 --> 01:31:21,476
My train leaves at 7:00.

693
01:31:22,435 --> 01:31:23,603
Come here.

694
01:31:37,826 --> 01:31:39,411
What?

695
01:31:39,744 --> 01:31:43,665
Do something for the boy. Put him in a boarding school.

696
01:31:43,790 --> 01:31:46,084
- You can do that yourself.
- No.

697
01:31:46,209 --> 01:31:47,752
Why not?

698
01:31:49,796 --> 01:31:51,881
- I just can’t.
- Why?

699
01:31:52,007 --> 01:31:54,426
That’s what I don’t get.

700
01:31:56,678 --> 01:31:59,723
There’s one thing I can never forget.

701
01:32:09,607 --> 01:32:11,860
It’s because Kajal is alive...

702
01:32:12,819 --> 01:32:14,654
that Aparna isn’t.

703
01:32:17,949 --> 01:32:22,162
I’ve sent money three times. I’ll send more if necessary.

704
01:32:22,829 --> 01:32:24,998
I can’t do any more.

705
01:32:28,793 --> 01:32:32,881
I can’t take any more responsibility for him.

706
01:32:35,216 --> 01:32:37,093
I admit it:

707
01:32:37,385 --> 01:32:40,013
I feel no affection for him.

708
01:32:42,056 --> 01:32:45,477
If you think he’s not being looked after properly...

709
01:32:46,561 --> 01:32:48,730
make other arrangements...

710
01:32:48,855 --> 01:32:51,399
and I’ll cover the cost.

711
01:32:59,783 --> 01:33:02,911
Shall I give you money now?
- There’s no point.

712
01:33:03,036 --> 01:33:05,038
I start a new job Monday.

713
01:33:05,163 --> 01:33:07,749
I can’t do anything right now.

714
01:33:08,041 --> 01:33:09,667
I’m going.

715
01:34:16,818 --> 01:34:18,528
Who is it?

716
01:34:25,994 --> 01:34:28,121
Whom do you wish to see?

717
01:34:33,334 --> 01:34:35,503
It’s me - Apu.

718
01:35:04,324 --> 01:35:06,701
Have you come to take him away?

719
01:35:08,203 --> 01:35:12,207
I’ve made arrangements to leave him in my home village.

720
01:35:14,626 --> 01:35:16,544
I’m going away.

721
01:35:16,878 --> 01:35:19,547
He’s lying down upstairs.

722
01:35:20,340 --> 01:35:22,300
He’s had a fever,

723
01:35:22,759 --> 01:35:24,928
but he’s better today.

724
01:38:30,029 --> 01:38:31,864
I’m your father.

725
01:38:38,496 --> 01:38:40,623
I’m your father.

726
01:38:46,254 --> 01:38:47,713
Come here!

727
01:38:48,131 --> 01:38:50,675
Come here!

728
01:39:10,319 --> 01:39:11,654
No, don’t!

729
01:39:13,072 --> 01:39:14,907
What are you doing?

730
01:39:17,994 --> 01:39:19,704
You’ll kill him.

731
01:40:39,700 --> 01:40:41,702
Will you be my friend?

732
01:40:43,162 --> 01:40:45,539
I tell very good stories.

733
01:40:46,707 --> 01:40:48,417
Stories about ghosts...

734
01:40:48,876 --> 01:40:50,878
demons...

735
01:40:51,671 --> 01:40:53,714
kings and queens...

736
01:40:53,965 --> 01:40:56,884
princes and winged horses.

737
01:40:57,802 --> 01:40:59,720
Want to hear them?

738
01:41:17,405 --> 01:41:20,074
I’ll leave this jewelry with you

739
01:41:20,366 --> 01:41:23,744
in case he has to be sent to a boarding school.

740
01:41:24,120 --> 01:41:26,330
I’ll speak to Pulu again,

741
01:41:26,455 --> 01:41:29,875
but you’ll have to bear with Kajal a few more days.

742
01:41:30,167 --> 01:41:31,752
Good-bye.

743
01:41:32,628 --> 01:41:34,380
You’re his father.

744
01:41:34,505 --> 01:41:37,258
Can’t you force him to go with you?

745
01:41:37,383 --> 01:41:41,178
He’s just a child. Make him go with you!

746
01:41:42,471 --> 01:41:44,932
No, I can’t do that.

747
01:41:47,768 --> 01:41:49,812
You can’t do anything!

748
01:41:49,937 --> 01:41:52,857
I knew it all along.

749
01:43:06,055 --> 01:43:09,558
What is it?
You want to say something?

750
01:43:10,935 --> 01:43:12,728
Where are you going?

751
01:43:14,021 --> 01:43:16,273
You want to come along?

752
01:43:16,857 --> 01:43:18,818
Are you going to Calcutta?

753
01:43:19,860 --> 01:43:21,946
If I am, will you come?

754
01:43:23,072 --> 01:43:25,157
Would you take me to my father?

755
01:43:28,327 --> 01:43:29,537
Of course.

756
01:43:31,038 --> 01:43:32,832
Will he be mad at me?

757
01:43:35,209 --> 01:43:36,919
Why should he be?

758
01:43:41,215 --> 01:43:43,300
He won’t go away and leave me?

759
01:43:45,219 --> 01:43:46,303
Never.

760
01:43:50,850 --> 01:43:52,351
Who are you?

761
01:43:55,729 --> 01:43:57,314
I’m your...

762
01:43:58,441 --> 01:44:00,151
friend.

763
01:44:01,819 --> 01:44:03,863
Will you come with me?

764
01:44:10,077 --> 01:44:11,120
Come on.

765
01:44:11,579 --> 01:44:13,706
Kajal, come on!

766
01:44:17,793 --> 01:44:20,087
Grandpa will scold me.

767
01:44:20,421 --> 01:44:21,964
He won’t know.

768
01:44:22,089 --> 01:44:24,550
I won’t tell him. Come on!

769
01:45:15,643 --> 01:45:18,312
THE END
