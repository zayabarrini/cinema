2
00:01:48,695 --> 00:01:52,026
Then the Gods said that, truly,

3
00:01:52,027 --> 00:01:55,464
this Demon can't be fought with.

4
00:01:55,976 --> 00:01:57,967
Brahma had given him
such a boon that...

5
00:01:57,992 --> 00:02:00,429
...no God was able to defeat him.

6
00:02:02,145 --> 00:02:05,979
Then Vishnu... Then Vishnu
flew into a rage.

7
00:02:06,862 --> 00:02:10,798
An aura emerged from his face,
an aura emerged from...

8
00:02:11,218 --> 00:02:13,482
...the face of Shiva as well.
And auras emerged...

9
00:02:13,553 --> 00:02:15,544
...from the faces of
the various Gods.

10
00:02:15,622 --> 00:02:21,151
All those auras converged
together and created this...

11
00:02:22,118 --> 00:02:25,554
...Goddess, Durga! This
Durga has 10 hands.

12
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:29,158
And with 10 kinds of weapons
in the 10 hands...

13
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:32,703
...astride a vehicle...
- What's her vehicle?

14
00:02:32,739 --> 00:02:36,505
Vehicle? Her vehicle is a lion.

15
00:02:37,017 --> 00:02:41,954
Durga's vehicle is a lion,
Ganesha's, a mouse.

16
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:48,026
Karthik's, a peacock.
Lakshmi's, an owl.

17
00:02:48,051 --> 00:02:51,214
And Saraswati's vehicle is a swan.

18
00:02:51,877 --> 00:02:56,946
The Goddess fought with
Mahishasura, on this lion.

19
00:02:57,094 --> 00:03:00,530
Is this all true?
- How do I falsify it, dear?

20
00:03:00,701 --> 00:03:03,465
The sages have written about it.

21
00:03:04,638 --> 00:03:07,981
Everything is true.
Mahishasura is true...

22
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:12,871
...Hanuman is true, Digpal is true,

23
00:03:12,949 --> 00:03:15,519
Varunadev is true...

24
00:03:48,515 --> 00:03:52,611
Uncle! The dacoits have come.

25
00:04:11,966 --> 00:04:16,952
Is Ghoshal there?
- Who are you? - Is he there? - Yes.

26
00:04:16,977 --> 00:04:20,242
Tell him that Maganlal Meghraj
has come to meet him.

27
00:04:20,823 --> 00:04:23,758
You tell me what you
want, I'm there.

28
00:04:31,466 --> 00:04:34,128
Your introduction?
- I'm Bikas Singh.

29
00:04:34,661 --> 00:04:38,153
Are you related to him?
- No. I stay in this house.

30
00:05:09,891 --> 00:05:11,882
What's the matter?

31
00:05:11,907 --> 00:05:15,104
You've come suddenly
after so many days?

32
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,901
Sit.

33
00:05:22,688 --> 00:05:25,179
How many days has it
been since we met?

34
00:05:25,212 --> 00:05:28,147
I had passed out in 1950.
And you, in '51.

35
00:05:28,215 --> 00:05:30,206
You'd failed one year.

36
00:05:31,537 --> 00:05:33,528
Tell me, what's the matter?

37
00:05:33,553 --> 00:05:36,147
I had last seen you at the temple...

38
00:05:36,223 --> 00:05:39,158
...so I thought, why not
come and meet you?

39
00:05:39,226 --> 00:05:41,660
We come here every
year for the Pujas.

40
00:05:41,728 --> 00:05:47,166
Father is here, uncle is here...
- And your Ganesh? - Ganesh?

41
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:53,592
You still remember that!?

42
00:05:54,233 --> 00:05:57,098
It's there. Why won't it be?

43
00:05:57,177 --> 00:06:01,113
It has become divine due
to our worship and care.

44
00:06:01,181 --> 00:06:05,447
Will you show it to me?
- It's kept in father's trunk.

45
00:06:05,795 --> 00:06:08,730
And the key of that trunk
is in father's garage.

46
00:06:08,798 --> 00:06:10,789
Doesn't your father
show it to anybody?

47
00:06:12,459 --> 00:06:14,450
Showing it to anybody and showing...

48
00:06:14,528 --> 00:06:16,519
...it to you, aren't the same thing.

49
00:06:16,544 --> 00:06:18,535
You're very popular in the market.

50
00:06:18,602 --> 00:06:21,070
You tend to get defamed
if you have money.

51
00:06:21,201 --> 00:06:25,467
You earn money like me, you,
too, will get defamed.

52
00:06:27,294 --> 00:06:31,287
But you also have to see
how you earn that money.

53
00:06:32,884 --> 00:06:35,197
I heard that you're
selling off the...

54
00:06:35,282 --> 00:06:37,477
...sculptures of the country
to the foreigners.

55
00:06:37,551 --> 00:06:40,645
And the Americans are giving
you fat money for that.

56
00:06:41,188 --> 00:06:44,583
I'm offering you Rs. 20000,

57
00:06:45,974 --> 00:06:48,887
I've brought it along with me.

58
00:06:49,002 --> 00:06:52,870
What?
- You haven't seen that thing yet.

59
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:56,101
Without seeing it, you're
offering such a high price!

60
00:06:56,491 --> 00:07:03,049
Gold figurine, a diamond
in the crown...

61
00:07:03,443 --> 00:07:05,930
...rubies and emeralds at the base...

62
00:07:05,993 --> 00:07:09,929
...it's of Nepali origin.
- How did you know so much about it?

63
00:07:10,733 --> 00:07:12,724
I haven't told you anything.

64
00:07:28,679 --> 00:07:30,670
This has been written by Father.

65
00:07:31,009 --> 00:07:33,000
I haven't seen it yet.

66
00:07:33,025 --> 00:07:36,461
Rs. 25000, cash.

67
00:07:37,487 --> 00:07:40,378
I know about your business.

68
00:07:40,403 --> 00:07:43,963
I also know how much money
you owe in the market.

69
00:07:44,515 --> 00:07:46,796
If I have to sell that
Ganesha to you...

70
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:49,919
...then I've to learn
the art of stealing.

71
00:07:51,373 --> 00:07:53,771
The question of selling
it doesn't arise.

72
00:07:53,944 --> 00:07:59,526
Rs. 30000. I don't ask for
things from everyone.

73
00:08:00,247 --> 00:08:05,760
If needed, I just snatch it.
It saves my money, too.

74
00:08:08,078 --> 00:08:11,044
I'm openly transacting with you.

75
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:15,874
No, brother. Sorry.

76
00:08:17,131 --> 00:08:21,292
Is this your final verdict?

77
00:08:21,293 --> 00:08:22,446
Yes.

78
00:09:58,029 --> 00:10:00,020
Who is it?

79
00:10:37,623 --> 00:10:41,286
Rest your head on your arms,
else it'll ache.

80
00:10:41,793 --> 00:10:44,626
Do you know how many temples
are there? - How many?

81
00:10:44,778 --> 00:10:50,717
How many temples are there?
- 33 crores.

82
00:10:53,699 --> 00:10:55,690
Just sign here.

83
00:11:00,246 --> 00:11:03,398
Is there a bathroom facility
in your house? - Yes.

84
00:11:03,423 --> 00:11:06,622
Look, I'm very particular
about bathrooms.

85
00:11:06,652 --> 00:11:08,643
Everything in my house...

86
00:11:12,395 --> 00:11:15,057
Are you Mr. Chakraborty?
- Yes.

87
00:11:15,242 --> 00:11:19,906
I'm Lal Mohan.
- Welcome!

88
00:11:20,403 --> 00:11:24,567
This is Paras Mitra.
- Ok. - And this is Tapas Pal.

89
00:11:25,183 --> 00:11:28,846
My assistant had given me a detailed
introduction about you.

90
00:11:30,609 --> 00:11:34,272
Do we have to sign?
- It's just a negligible formality.

91
00:11:35,347 --> 00:11:37,338
You're the eldest, you've to do it.

92
00:11:37,656 --> 00:11:40,147
You just write your
names and sign here.

93
00:11:40,172 --> 00:11:42,163
I'll take care of the rest.

94
00:11:42,188 --> 00:11:45,055
Your assistant is related to me.

95
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:48,747
That's what I was thinking that...

96
00:11:50,326 --> 00:11:52,724
You're the one with the
synonym Jatadhar...

97
00:11:53,683 --> 00:11:56,091
Not 'Dhar', but 'Yu'.

98
00:11:58,356 --> 00:12:02,072
I'm writing a new novel,
Kaalgombhir.

99
00:12:03,468 --> 00:12:06,589
O really!? Send the
luggage to room no. 3.

100
00:12:08,365 --> 00:12:10,578
I'm giving you a 4-bedded room.

101
00:12:16,334 --> 00:12:19,738
Please sit for a while,
I'll be back. - Ok.

102
00:12:24,195 --> 00:12:27,121
What arrangements do you
have for water? - What?

103
00:12:29,021 --> 00:12:31,012
You'll get running water
all throughout the day.

104
00:12:31,037 --> 00:12:33,816
Hot water will be given to
you whenever you want it.

105
00:12:36,787 --> 00:12:40,212
Wow! Quite good.
- It's good, even...

106
00:12:40,345 --> 00:12:43,781
...though it is not like the Jodhpur
circuit house, but will do.

107
00:12:43,811 --> 00:12:46,746
Decide where all of you
are going to sleep.

108
00:12:46,775 --> 00:12:48,766
Do you want the window-side bed?

109
00:12:49,719 --> 00:12:52,440
Is it facing the road?
- Yes.

110
00:12:53,313 --> 00:12:55,799
No. This one is good for a writer.

111
00:12:57,562 --> 00:13:01,571
You will get a healthy person
besides you. - Healthy?

112
00:13:01,596 --> 00:13:04,277
Yes.
- See what's hanging there.

113
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,135
Seems to be a person with taste.

114
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:38,742
It seems that this has also
come with that person.

115
00:13:38,936 --> 00:13:41,519
You mean he has brought
this big mirror with him.

116
00:13:41,627 --> 00:13:45,157
Must have a use. Mere shaving
is not the only purpose.

117
00:13:45,345 --> 00:13:48,508
You mean he shaves the hair
on his chest. - Bodybuilder.

118
00:13:49,347 --> 00:13:52,612
Very good! Did you see how my
assistant is being prepared?

119
00:14:09,911 --> 00:14:12,153
This place goes straight
to Dasharsadan.

120
00:14:12,943 --> 00:14:16,362
Dasharsadan!? That's a great place.

121
00:14:16,641 --> 00:14:19,365
The name's place creates
devotion in our hearts.

122
00:14:19,439 --> 00:14:21,746
Will that help you in your
job? You would not...

123
00:14:21,771 --> 00:14:24,014
...be writing a novel on devotion.

124
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:27,575
It's all because of the
thrill of that place.

125
00:14:29,196 --> 00:14:33,077
In my hotel, a 26 year old one,
this is the first time that...

126
00:14:33,109 --> 00:14:35,373
...3 famous people are
staying together.

127
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:36,673
3 people!?

128
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:40,264
Famous historian, popular
novelist and in room no. 4...

129
00:14:40,332 --> 00:14:43,597
...Bishosri. - Bishosri?
That famous body builder?

130
00:14:43,668 --> 00:14:46,603
Have you seen him?
- Yes. On TV.

131
00:14:46,895 --> 00:14:49,581
You won't believe,
I saw him eating...

132
00:14:49,669 --> 00:14:51,465
...he bend his hands like this...

133
00:14:51,543 --> 00:14:53,477
...and his wrist was
bulging like this.

134
00:14:53,502 --> 00:14:56,203
17 inches
- 17 inches?

135
00:14:56,281 --> 00:14:58,272
That's what he said.

136
00:14:58,736 --> 00:15:02,915
What about you? - My shirt
collar size is 12 inches.

137
00:15:06,324 --> 00:15:08,742
Come, sit. I've ordered tea for you.

138
00:15:14,753 --> 00:15:17,688
And yes! Do you know
inspector Tiwari?

139
00:15:17,784 --> 00:15:20,719
The one at Mahamayatala?
- Yes. He's at the station.

140
00:15:21,192 --> 00:15:23,854
Yes, I think he has helped
me with some case.

141
00:15:24,097 --> 00:15:26,759
I met him on the road, today.
I told him about you...

142
00:15:26,784 --> 00:15:29,052
...he has asked you
to visit him.

143
00:15:29,133 --> 00:15:32,351
Isn't there anything exciting
in your hotel?

144
00:15:32,478 --> 00:15:35,576
I don't know whether
it's exciting or not.

145
00:15:35,654 --> 00:15:38,248
But there's a powerful sage here,
he's said to possess...

146
00:15:38,323 --> 00:15:40,757
...magical powers, his
name is Machlibaba!

147
00:15:41,104 --> 00:15:43,766
Machlibaba!?
- Yes.

148
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:46,053
He has swam from Kashi to here.

149
00:15:46,114 --> 00:15:48,139
What're you saying?! From Kashi!?

150
00:15:48,187 --> 00:15:50,951
I'm not saying so, that person
claims to have done so.

151
00:15:50,976 --> 00:15:53,421
This is ridiculous!

152
00:15:53,446 --> 00:15:56,092
He gives sermons at the
banks of the river...

153
00:15:56,117 --> 00:15:58,402
...there's a devotional gathering,
then there's a...

154
00:15:58,476 --> 00:16:02,207
...session of devotional songs.
And if the Baba shows mercy...

155
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:06,216
...on someone, then he gives him
a Shalka talisman that day.

156
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:11,161
What's a Shalka!?
- You're so vague.

157
00:16:11,967 --> 00:16:13,958
Shalka is a fish's gill.

158
00:17:20,952 --> 00:17:24,615
Do you want, sir?
- What? - A Shalka talisman?

159
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,575
That sage has a radiance
on his face...

160
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,535
...you've to accept it,
whatever you say.

161
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:39,551
Is there any member of the public
among these devotees?

162
00:17:39,576 --> 00:17:41,315
Or are all of them
his paid devotees?

163
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:44,332
What're you saying, sir!? They're
all the cream of Kashi.

164
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:47,949
There. The one on the front,
wearing a black coat...

165
00:17:47,974 --> 00:17:50,909
...he's an agent of
the Allahabad Bank.

166
00:17:50,977 --> 00:17:53,411
He's a learned man. A great scholar.

167
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:56,899
And the one with the bald head,
he's the professor...

168
00:17:56,977 --> 00:17:58,968
...of Benaras University.

169
00:17:59,346 --> 00:18:05,182
And the greatest devotee...
there he comes.

170
00:18:10,738 --> 00:18:12,729
Give me your binoculars.

171
00:18:23,203 --> 00:18:26,366
Madanlal Midraj. Haven't
you heard his name?

172
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:30,876
The one whose house was raided
a few days back in Kolkata.

173
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:33,879
He visits this place regularly.
- Does he have a house here?

174
00:18:33,947 --> 00:18:37,212
What're you saying, sir!
He has a house, farm...

175
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:39,274
...charity home, everything!

176
00:18:58,238 --> 00:19:00,229
This place is Baba's favorite
resting place.

177
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:04,902
Nothing unexpected! Thieves
tend to like such places.

178
00:19:22,429 --> 00:19:24,920
It seems he's taking a gift.

179
00:19:25,265 --> 00:19:27,256
The Baba doesn't ask for all this.

180
00:19:48,288 --> 00:19:52,281
The Baba doesn't stay at one
place for a long time.

181
00:19:53,293 --> 00:19:56,228
Then is his next stop at Patna?
- I don't know, sir.

182
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,898
Will the Baba dive into
the Ganges from here?

183
00:20:49,282 --> 00:20:54,948
One Brahma, one sun, one moon.

184
00:20:57,223 --> 00:21:00,886
He's amazing. I don't know whether
he's a great saint...

185
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,999
...but he's a great personality
for sure.

186
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:08,750
Two hands. Two legs.

187
00:21:08,751 --> 00:21:13,895
Two eyes. Two ears. Three
generations. Three periods.

188
00:21:14,407 --> 00:21:17,399
Four seasons. Four senses.

189
00:21:18,225 --> 00:21:21,058
Five elements. Five fingers.

190
00:21:21,521 --> 00:21:24,786
Five limbs. Five Pandav.

191
00:21:25,662 --> 00:21:28,927
One, two, three, four and five.

192
00:21:32,718 --> 00:21:35,653
The Baba has a Vimano
Ulki in his hands.

193
00:21:36,047 --> 00:21:38,038
You've amazing eyesight, sir.

194
00:21:38,233 --> 00:21:40,326
I've come here before, but
I couldn't figure it out.

195
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,491
See for yourself.

196
00:21:47,013 --> 00:21:50,676
He seems similar. I've seen
such a ulki with Keshto...

197
00:21:50,701 --> 00:21:53,636
...in our colony.
- Let me see!

198
00:21:58,561 --> 00:22:00,552
Just a minute!

199
00:22:33,976 --> 00:22:35,367
Shall I introduce you?

200
00:22:36,742 --> 00:22:39,006
He's a great detective.

201
00:22:39,103 --> 00:22:41,162
He's the most popular writer.

202
00:22:43,579 --> 00:22:45,843
Do you stay in Benaras?
- My father stays here.

203
00:22:46,332 --> 00:22:48,323
We come here for the Pujas.

204
00:22:48,401 --> 00:22:50,926
He's been here for 60 years.

205
00:22:51,692 --> 00:22:53,683
Are you staying in Calcutta lodge?

206
00:22:53,878 --> 00:22:55,812
Yes. In my place.

207
00:22:56,493 --> 00:23:00,987
Is it about some case?
- No. Just a holiday.

208
00:23:03,187 --> 00:23:08,022
I was asking you, because
I may need you.

209
00:23:08,603 --> 00:23:13,540
I mean, the problem is that there's
been a theft in my house.

210
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:17,896
My father is a bit upset.
- Didn't you inform the police?

211
00:23:18,231 --> 00:23:21,894
My father doesn't have much
faith in the police.

212
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:26,913
But he's here. - That's why I
was thinking that I shall ask...

213
00:23:26,938 --> 00:23:30,874
...Father about it, if he agrees,
then I shall call you up.

214
00:23:31,622 --> 00:23:34,479
Alright.
- Ok. Then we shall leave now.

215
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:37,135
As we've to go that side for...

216
00:24:36,754 --> 00:24:42,121
I've heard of you. But I haven't
seen you till now.

217
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:50,922
There's a program on Saptami day.

218
00:24:51,257 --> 00:24:53,248
You can attend.

219
00:24:53,326 --> 00:24:56,505
Are those bubbles on your
arms, truly 17 inches?

220
00:25:08,973 --> 00:25:10,702
See.

221
00:25:23,053 --> 00:25:25,044
Touch it.

222
00:25:26,509 --> 00:25:31,421
Oh God! I don't get the feeling
that I'm touching a human body.

223
00:25:31,957 --> 00:25:33,948
It's just as I had told you.

224
00:25:35,655 --> 00:25:37,646
These are the triceps, feel it.

225
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:40,812
Those were the biceps and
these are the triceps?

226
00:25:41,427 --> 00:25:43,418
Is there anything above triceps?

227
00:25:43,457 --> 00:25:45,826
Yes, quadriceps.

228
00:25:46,842 --> 00:25:51,506
What a great thing. A total build
up of muscles. - 400 here...

229
00:25:51,684 --> 00:25:56,553
...400 here. When you stretch like
this, that is also a muscle.

230
00:25:56,578 --> 00:25:58,886
You open your mouth.

231
00:25:58,911 --> 00:26:03,872
That is a muscle. You
chew that's a muscle.

232
00:26:04,263 --> 00:26:08,199
For every movement there
is a muscle coordination.

233
00:26:08,655 --> 00:26:10,646
Does every muscle have
a separate name?

234
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:16,170
Write it down. It'll
help you in future.

235
00:26:16,551 --> 00:26:18,542
Really. We know so little.

236
00:26:18,633 --> 00:26:21,994
No! I wouldn't have believed
it, hadn't I seen it.

237
00:26:22,694 --> 00:26:27,162
What a practice! - It needs
discipline. - That's true.

238
00:26:30,679 --> 00:26:34,513
What're you seeing? I shall change
your body in just 2 months.

239
00:26:34,609 --> 00:26:39,208
What? Do you want to change?
- No. I don't need it.

240
00:26:39,412 --> 00:26:42,514
Do you bend rods?

241
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:49,123
Yes. We've to do it.

242
00:26:55,563 --> 00:26:59,159
Do you lift people?
- No. I don't do that.

243
00:27:00,186 --> 00:27:04,498
Whom do you want me to lift? You?
- No!

244
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:19,423
You've got a telephone call.
- What's this? So soon?

245
00:27:39,553 --> 00:27:41,073
Did you see?

246
00:27:44,122 --> 00:27:47,262
Do something. They're
killing those birds.

247
00:27:49,911 --> 00:27:53,904
They won't listen to us.
Let's go inside.

248
00:28:00,956 --> 00:28:04,931
Welcome! Are you Produshocho?
- Yes.

249
00:28:04,956 --> 00:28:07,680
Mr. Ghoshal is expecting you.

250
00:28:10,208 --> 00:28:12,945
Come.

251
00:28:21,531 --> 00:28:24,047
Sit. I shall come.

252
00:28:33,275 --> 00:28:35,266
What a painting!

253
00:28:35,544 --> 00:28:37,535
How do you feel?

254
00:28:39,281 --> 00:28:42,629
Brother, they're modeling
the idols of Gods.

255
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:54,222
Wow! This God is like
the one in Kolkata.

256
00:28:54,563 --> 00:28:57,225
Kashi is the second
home for Bengalis.

257
00:28:57,566 --> 00:29:00,228
1.5 lakh Bengalis stay here,
in Kashi. - 1.5 lakh!

258
00:29:00,302 --> 00:29:02,293
Sarojda is coming by Doon express.

259
00:29:02,937 --> 00:29:06,270
Sister is also coming same day by
Amritsar mail. Receive both of them.

260
00:29:07,126 --> 00:29:11,062
Greetings. - We were looking
at the idols here.

261
00:29:13,099 --> 00:29:16,214
Come on. Come inside.

262
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,584
Father is a great follower
of detective stories.

263
00:29:20,656 --> 00:29:24,251
That's why he agreed when
I told him about you.

264
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:28,865
Does he read a lot?
- All the time.

265
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:31,428
Only English or also Bengali?

266
00:29:31,453 --> 00:29:33,444
He leaves nothing.

267
00:29:33,469 --> 00:29:37,269
I wanted to know something.
Was that boy, your son?

268
00:29:37,339 --> 00:29:40,604
Who? Nopu? He's just another
boy in the family.

269
00:29:40,676 --> 00:29:43,270
He was standing at the edge
of the terrace wall.

270
00:29:43,345 --> 00:29:46,104
And was also killing the birds!

271
00:29:49,091 --> 00:29:51,082
Bikash!

272
00:29:53,038 --> 00:29:55,029
Send for him. He's on the terrace.

273
00:29:55,197 --> 00:29:58,300
Tell him that Father is
calling him immediately.

274
00:30:00,562 --> 00:30:02,553
Leave it.

275
00:30:02,631 --> 00:30:04,622
Let me come to the point.

276
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:09,184
The thing that has been stolen,
is an idol of Lord Ganesha.

277
00:30:09,405 --> 00:30:13,239
It's quite tall, made of gold.

278
00:30:13,308 --> 00:30:18,245
It's embellished with rubies,
emeralds, diamonds, etc.

279
00:30:19,405 --> 00:30:23,066
Its price... must be around a lakh.

280
00:30:23,318 --> 00:30:25,840
To which place does it belong?
- It belongs to Nepal.

281
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:28,105
It was brought from there.

282
00:30:28,323 --> 00:30:33,781
That picture is that
of my grandfather.

283
00:30:34,329 --> 00:30:36,763
He was the housekeeper of the Rana.

284
00:30:37,433 --> 00:30:41,267
Once, he rescues Rana from one
of the attacks of his enemies.

285
00:30:41,336 --> 00:30:43,993
Then the Rana gets pleased
and gives it to him.

286
00:30:44,339 --> 00:30:49,276
Since he got the Ganesha, Grandpa
sees small incidents...

287
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:51,335
...and creates a belief
in the family...

288
00:30:51,413 --> 00:30:53,404
...that the Ganesha is very lucky.

289
00:30:53,429 --> 00:30:55,766
Did all these incidents
take place in Nepal?

290
00:30:55,791 --> 00:31:00,898
No. Radhanath came down to
Kashi within a few days.

291
00:31:01,062 --> 00:31:04,657
He has his practice here, and
earns a lot of money and fame.

292
00:31:04,733 --> 00:31:06,724
In fact, this house too,
belongs to him.

293
00:31:06,817 --> 00:31:11,311
A few days before this idol is
stolen, a man offers to buy it.

294
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:15,919
And offers up to Rs. 30000.
- What's the name of that person?

295
00:31:15,944 --> 00:31:19,110
Maganlal. Maganlal Meghraj.

296
00:31:19,732 --> 00:31:21,723
Did you know him?

297
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,751
Yes. We studied in the same college.

298
00:31:23,896 --> 00:31:25,887
Did you refuse to
sell it to him?

299
00:31:25,912 --> 00:31:29,746
That thing doesn't belong to me.
It was brought by Radhanath.

300
00:31:30,102 --> 00:31:32,093
It's with my father,
in his trunk, now.

301
00:31:32,171 --> 00:31:35,698
And I stay in Kolkata.
- And what was Maganlal's reaction?

302
00:31:35,775 --> 00:31:38,753
I obviously can't say that
he felt happy about it.

303
00:31:38,778 --> 00:31:40,769
When did the theft take place?

304
00:31:40,846 --> 00:31:43,713
It took place, exactly the
next night of his visit.

305
00:31:43,783 --> 00:31:45,774
Father came back the
next day and saw...

306
00:31:45,851 --> 00:31:47,842
...that the key was hanging
on the trunk...

307
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,770
...and the idol isn't there.

308
00:31:51,603 --> 00:31:54,595
Is there any reason to doubt
anyone in the house?

309
00:31:55,026 --> 00:31:58,962
The servants, who're there,
are all old and reliable.

310
00:31:59,622 --> 00:32:05,524
And there's just Grandpa, Father,
me, my wife and Bikash.

311
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:08,211
Here's your son.

312
00:32:15,216 --> 00:32:17,483
Did you climb the terrace walls?

313
00:32:17,508 --> 00:32:20,170
Why? What if you had fallen?

314
00:32:20,195 --> 00:32:22,186
Don't you know that
you shouldn't do so?

315
00:32:22,211 --> 00:32:24,827
Captain Park climbs the walls, too.

316
00:32:25,324 --> 00:32:26,358
Who!?

317
00:32:30,308 --> 00:32:33,741
He's a character in a mystery series.

318
00:32:33,766 --> 00:32:37,702
He climbs upside down.
- Yes. His head at the bottom...

319
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:39,761
...and his legs on top. Isn't it?

320
00:32:43,545 --> 00:32:46,480
Who's giving him such books? You?

321
00:32:46,783 --> 00:32:49,540
These days, all the boys...

322
00:32:49,618 --> 00:32:52,485
You won't do any such thing. He'll
read all such weird books...

323
00:32:52,554 --> 00:32:55,489
...and get clouded with such
ridiculously dangerous ideas.

324
00:32:55,757 --> 00:32:57,748
If I hear again that you've
done any such thing...

325
00:32:57,826 --> 00:33:00,420
...then I shall lock
you up in your room. Go!

326
00:33:05,252 --> 00:33:10,189
Who's Bikash? - Bikash
just stays in our house.

327
00:33:10,276 --> 00:33:12,938
He's the son of one of the
employees of my father.

328
00:33:12,933 --> 00:33:14,924
He lost his parents
while he was young.

329
00:33:14,949 --> 00:33:17,238
Since then, my father
brings him up himself.

330
00:33:17,316 --> 00:33:21,116
What does he do? - He takes
care of the household chores.

331
00:33:21,186 --> 00:33:24,886
And does some ordinary job in
a Hindi publication company.

332
00:33:27,419 --> 00:33:30,081
If we could meet your father...

333
00:33:30,106 --> 00:33:32,904
Yes. He's waiting for you.

334
00:33:33,465 --> 00:33:36,706
One thing. Father is a
little short tempered.

335
00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:40,845
And yes! Father doesn't know
about Magalal's visit.

336
00:33:41,206 --> 00:33:44,054
Take care.
- Ok. Take care.

337
00:33:50,215 --> 00:33:52,206
It seems that a gramophone
is playing.

338
00:33:52,284 --> 00:33:55,738
It's my grandfather. He's 84.

339
00:33:56,401 --> 00:33:59,944
Once upon a time, he was
very fond of music.

340
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,151
Now, the only thing that he
does is key the gramophone...

341
00:34:03,228 --> 00:34:06,267
...and change the records.

342
00:34:08,167 --> 00:34:11,683
Father, they've come.
- Let me see.

343
00:34:12,171 --> 00:34:14,540
How great a detective are you?

344
00:34:15,174 --> 00:34:18,638
Are you 6 feet tall?
- Yes.

345
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:22,103
And he?
- I'm 5.5.

346
00:34:22,447 --> 00:34:25,531
I've no interest in your height.

347
00:34:25,617 --> 00:34:28,450
Detectives in novels have
a person with them.

348
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:32,454
Like Holmes had Watson. The
other one had Hastings.

349
00:34:32,524 --> 00:34:35,804
Our Byomkesh had Ajit.
Are you like that?

350
00:34:36,195 --> 00:34:41,132
This is my friend. You can
call him my assistant...

351
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,191
...my cousin brother, Tapesh.

352
00:34:43,268 --> 00:34:48,137
Looking at your appearance, it
doesn't seem that you're dumb.

353
00:34:48,207 --> 00:34:54,136
That too, when the three of you
won't be working together.

354
00:34:56,394 --> 00:34:59,221
Come. Let's sit in my
room and discuss.

355
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:06,824
I've kept records of everything.
This is my family's photo.

356
00:35:14,433 --> 00:35:18,847
Beautiful! - Not only beautiful,
it's a work of art.

357
00:35:19,094 --> 00:35:24,151
It isn't a small thing. That's the
reason I don't believe that...

358
00:35:24,176 --> 00:35:27,441
...small things can't
change a man's life.

359
00:35:31,042 --> 00:35:33,977
Now see, detective sir.
Watch carefully.

360
00:35:34,002 --> 00:35:39,068
This is the key of my trunk.
Here, I'm opening it.

361
00:35:39,431 --> 00:35:41,422
Here's the key.

362
00:35:43,292 --> 00:35:47,357
Come. Come.

363
00:35:52,836 --> 00:35:55,828
Here's my trunk, I'm opening it.

364
00:36:00,033 --> 00:36:04,279
Here, I twisted my wrist.
Here's the drawer.

365
00:36:04,867 --> 00:36:07,702
Here's where my Ganesha was kept.

366
00:36:08,618 --> 00:36:13,282
The Ganesha isn't there. - How
was the trunk, when opened?

367
00:36:13,356 --> 00:36:15,347
The drawer was open, the trunk...

368
00:36:15,425 --> 00:36:17,416
...was open, and the key was hanging.

369
00:36:24,801 --> 00:36:26,792
This is my bed.

370
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:29,304
I slept at 10.30 that night.

371
00:36:29,372 --> 00:36:32,004
Do you sleep soundly?
- Not quite soundly.

372
00:36:32,029 --> 00:36:35,351
I have a habit of consuming opium.

373
00:36:35,812 --> 00:36:38,804
When I sleep, I don't
have much awareness.

374
00:36:39,649 --> 00:36:44,313
But that night, while sleeping,
I heard a noise.

375
00:36:44,387 --> 00:36:50,326
I thought that it was just another
noise, and dozed off.

376
00:36:52,395 --> 00:36:54,386
Look at all this.

377
00:36:54,464 --> 00:36:57,644
Can you say what all these
are, assistant sir?

378
00:36:58,152 --> 00:37:00,143
Detective novels.

379
00:37:00,194 --> 00:37:02,866
I've swallowed every book.

380
00:37:03,076 --> 00:37:06,774
So, cunningness won't work with me.

381
00:37:06,843 --> 00:37:11,867
If you're able to catch the thief,
then you'll be well rewarded.

382
00:37:12,615 --> 00:37:14,606
Or else, chili powder.

383
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:19,997
I've 2 questions.
- What?

384
00:37:21,057 --> 00:37:23,048
Why did you call me?

385
00:37:23,073 --> 00:37:25,064
You could've done this yourself.

386
00:37:25,089 --> 00:37:28,075
Had I been of your age, and
possessed your strength...

387
00:37:28,144 --> 00:37:30,406
...then I wouldn't have called you.

388
00:37:30,694 --> 00:37:34,562
Then second question is,
do you doubt anybody?

389
00:37:37,373 --> 00:37:40,308
No one from the viewpoint
of a father.

390
00:37:40,376 --> 00:37:42,435
I won't say anything more than that.

391
00:37:42,512 --> 00:37:44,503
The rest is your job.

392
00:37:55,322 --> 00:37:57,707
I had warned you earlier.

393
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:12,604
Can I go to the terrace?
- Of course.

394
00:38:12,675 --> 00:38:14,666
You can tour the house.

395
00:38:14,744 --> 00:38:16,735
I'll send Bikash with you.

396
00:38:16,813 --> 00:38:19,281
You can tell him if
you need anything.

397
00:38:19,349 --> 00:38:21,340
Ok. C'mon.

398
00:39:47,036 --> 00:39:49,027
Is this the house of Captain Spark?

399
00:39:51,708 --> 00:39:54,370
If there's Spark, then there
must surely be an assistant.

400
00:39:54,606 --> 00:39:59,202
He's there.
- Raxit? - Yes.

401
00:40:00,817 --> 00:40:03,308
Khudiram Rakkhito. That
Rakkhito is Raxit.

402
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:09,481
The Ganesha was stolen despite...

403
00:40:09,559 --> 00:40:11,652
...the presence of Captain
Spark, in the house?

404
00:40:12,173 --> 00:40:15,108
How did this happen? Did
this happen for good?

405
00:40:15,398 --> 00:40:17,389
It's with a king.

406
00:40:19,037 --> 00:40:21,028
Which king?

407
00:40:21,471 --> 00:40:23,462
An African king.

408
00:40:23,487 --> 00:40:29,065
How did you know?
- Captain Spark knows it.

409
00:40:30,132 --> 00:40:32,965
Can't it be taken back
from that king?

410
00:40:36,951 --> 00:40:40,117
Spark will do it.
- Will he?

411
00:40:40,423 --> 00:40:43,034
Else it'll go back to Atlantis.

412
00:40:43,231 --> 00:40:46,302
The secret city under
the ocean? - Yes.

413
00:40:47,397 --> 00:40:50,486
It seems this boy has swallowed
all detective novels.

414
00:40:50,595 --> 00:40:53,257
Atlantis has been mentioned in
one of the detective books.

415
00:40:58,646 --> 00:41:01,877
Can I see Captain Spark's house?

416
00:41:41,417 --> 00:41:43,408
Here!

417
00:41:57,063 --> 00:41:58,997
Are you a detective?

418
00:42:01,370 --> 00:42:03,634
Do you have a harpoon?

419
00:42:06,356 --> 00:42:08,347
An extra gun?

420
00:42:11,504 --> 00:42:13,495
Then what do you have?

421
00:42:14,428 --> 00:42:16,944
What I have, isn't with me now.

422
00:42:21,051 --> 00:42:23,042
The revolver that shoots?

423
00:42:24,223 --> 00:42:26,214
How many bullets?

424
00:42:27,355 --> 00:42:29,346
Six.

425
00:42:33,669 --> 00:42:38,333
I can show it to you, only if
you promise me that you...

426
00:42:38,407 --> 00:42:41,417
...won't climb the terrace
walls, again.

427
00:42:44,413 --> 00:42:48,349
I've another weapon.
It can't be seen.

428
00:42:49,685 --> 00:42:53,348
What?
- Intelligence. It's kept over here.

429
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:59,941
Sometimes, it suddenly enters
a person's mind, and learns...

430
00:43:00,363 --> 00:43:02,930
...all that is stored there.

431
00:43:04,106 --> 00:43:08,372
It's saying that Captain Spark
likes to talk in Hiyali.

432
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:10,851
Do you know Hiyali?

433
00:43:11,807 --> 00:43:15,641
'It is a strange thing. You
chew it and it tastes good'.

434
00:43:19,382 --> 00:43:21,373
Do you know Hiyali?

435
00:43:21,651 --> 00:43:25,314
'Five brothers are together,
eating rice with fish'.

436
00:43:25,388 --> 00:43:29,023
'There are five more.
How do you do? '

437
00:43:29,825 --> 00:43:35,661
'Five brothers are together,
eating rice with fish'.

438
00:43:35,956 --> 00:43:40,815
'There are five more.
How do you do? '

439
00:43:44,427 --> 00:43:48,310
Ok. I shall leave now.

440
00:43:48,678 --> 00:43:51,340
Your grandfather has given us a job.

441
00:43:51,414 --> 00:43:53,678
If we aren't able to do it,
then we'll be defamed.

442
00:43:53,749 --> 00:43:58,277
What's your name?
- My good name is Captain Famous.

443
00:43:58,354 --> 00:44:01,169
And real name is Pradosh Mitra.

444
00:44:05,628 --> 00:44:09,291
Come. Tea has been ordered
for you. Come.

445
00:44:16,443 --> 00:44:19,435
What's Rukku's good name?
- Rukmini Kumar.

446
00:44:20,037 --> 00:44:22,187
Are you Raxit?
- What?

447
00:44:23,833 --> 00:44:27,148
Captain Spark's assistant.

448
00:44:27,650 --> 00:44:30,312
I'm won't be surprised
if I'm made one.

449
00:44:30,653 --> 00:44:36,215
Because last year, he was Tintin,
and I was Captain Haddock.

450
00:44:51,286 --> 00:44:53,948
Since when did the painting start?

451
00:44:54,237 --> 00:44:58,901
Since when did the painting start,
sir? - Since Saturday.

452
00:45:00,687 --> 00:45:04,953
Does he stay here?
- No. He comes from Ganeshmohalla.

453
00:45:07,271 --> 00:45:12,937
It's Shashti, the day after. Will
your job be over by then?

454
00:45:14,588 --> 00:45:16,579
Yes. It'll be over.

455
00:45:20,653 --> 00:45:23,767
Come. Let's go to your room.

456
00:45:27,962 --> 00:45:32,626
Were you there when Maganlal came?

457
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:36,966
Yes. I was in my room.
- How long was he here?

458
00:45:37,038 --> 00:45:39,029
Around a half hour.

459
00:45:46,299 --> 00:45:50,166
Were you at home?
- Yes.

460
00:45:51,639 --> 00:45:54,641
What where you doing?

461
00:45:54,989 --> 00:45:56,980
I was listening to music.

462
00:45:57,562 --> 00:46:02,140
Radio?
- Yes, classical.

463
00:46:09,901 --> 00:46:12,734
Which station?
- Lucknow.

464
00:46:23,684 --> 00:46:27,620
Since when are you here?
- Since years. From '57.

465
00:46:27,961 --> 00:46:31,226
Do you like it?
- I've got used to it.

466
00:46:47,708 --> 00:46:50,510
I think you're aware of
your weak position.

467
00:46:51,712 --> 00:46:53,703
There's nothing to
be aware of.

468
00:46:53,781 --> 00:46:59,421
I'm no one here. Just seeking
shelter in Ghosh's house.

469
00:47:00,353 --> 00:47:03,353
Had I had any interest
in the Ganesha...

470
00:47:03,427 --> 00:47:07,693
...then I could've done so,
a long time back.

471
00:47:09,062 --> 00:47:14,455
I've had no recent developments
requiring any money as such.

472
00:47:15,046 --> 00:47:17,423
Has that happened to anybody else?

473
00:47:17,823 --> 00:47:21,358
Forgive me. I won't be able
to comment on this matter.

474
00:47:22,457 --> 00:47:25,818
If commenting on that improves
your position...

475
00:47:26,051 --> 00:47:29,280
...then refusing to comment,
would be foolish.

476
00:47:29,464 --> 00:47:33,400
Don't forget. You had
both the reason...

477
00:47:33,468 --> 00:47:36,733
...and the opportunity to steal.

478
00:47:36,938 --> 00:47:42,482
Reason?
- Freedom from staying here.

479
00:47:44,479 --> 00:47:46,955
If you have anything
to say, then say it.

480
00:47:47,139 --> 00:47:50,770
Deciding whether it's true
or false is my duty.

481
00:47:54,489 --> 00:47:59,999
Mr. Ghoshal's business
isn't going well.

482
00:48:00,695 --> 00:48:03,835
You'll come to know of it,
if you investigate.

483
00:48:03,939 --> 00:48:06,202
And you also have that opportunity.

484
00:48:06,227 --> 00:48:08,218
Bikash! Tea!

485
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:10,364
C'mon.

486
00:48:17,445 --> 00:48:19,436
Is everything alright?
- Yes. Everything's fine.

487
00:48:19,514 --> 00:48:21,505
The salt, spice, etc...
- I didn't know that...

488
00:48:21,582 --> 00:48:23,573
...you could get such
a huge fish in Kashi!

489
00:48:23,651 --> 00:48:26,381
I've arranged for it with
great difficulty, sir.

490
00:48:26,454 --> 00:48:28,445
Don't give up, at least
as long as we are here.

491
00:48:28,523 --> 00:48:31,390
And yes! Don't worry if your
job doesn't end...

492
00:48:31,459 --> 00:48:32,778
...within 10 days.

493
00:48:32,803 --> 00:48:35,394
I've already booked 3 beds for you.

494
00:48:35,463 --> 00:48:37,727
Thank you. But the job will
end in 10 days...

495
00:48:37,799 --> 00:48:39,790
...else it never will.

496
00:48:39,867 --> 00:48:42,392
No! Don't say such a thing,
in Kashi, that too, in my...

497
00:48:42,470 --> 00:48:45,735
...Calcutta lodge, one of your
adventures should be remembered.

498
00:48:45,807 --> 00:48:47,798
Let's see.

499
00:48:52,045 --> 00:48:54,036
He isn't saying anything.

500
00:48:54,749 --> 00:48:57,741
Despite the presence of Jatayu...

501
00:48:57,819 --> 00:49:02,415
...Captain Spark took
away his attention.

502
00:49:02,490 --> 00:49:06,426
How can he refuse that?
- You're right.

503
00:49:06,761 --> 00:49:08,752
It means that you aren't the only...

504
00:49:08,830 --> 00:49:11,424
...popular detective novelist in
the country. You've a rival.

505
00:49:11,933 --> 00:49:14,424
Yesterday's brat! The one
that stays in Darjipada.

506
00:49:14,502 --> 00:49:18,438
He writes under a synonym. I
wrote an edition in 3 days...

507
00:49:18,506 --> 00:49:21,681
...and he hasn't finished
one in 3 months.

508
00:49:22,671 --> 00:49:27,665
Is he the creator of
the character Spark...

509
00:49:27,771 --> 00:49:32,721
If he gets an idea, then a spark
flashes from his forehead.

510
00:49:32,962 --> 00:49:34,896
Understood?

511
00:49:36,374 --> 00:49:39,293
You've got a phone call,
shall I ask him...

512
00:49:39,901 --> 00:49:42,836
...to call back after 10 minutes?
- No. I shall attend to it.

513
00:49:53,808 --> 00:49:57,801
Is this Mitra?
- Yes. - I'm Maganlal Meghraj.

514
00:49:57,879 --> 00:49:59,744
Oh! Greetings!

515
00:49:59,814 --> 00:50:02,408
I saw you at the ashram
of Machlibaba yesterday.

516
00:50:02,483 --> 00:50:04,474
How did you recognize me?

517
00:50:04,552 --> 00:50:07,419
I have my own methods. There're
people to show me.

518
00:50:07,922 --> 00:50:09,753
I can understand that.

519
00:50:09,824 --> 00:50:11,815
What are you doing this afternoon?
- Why?

520
00:50:11,893 --> 00:50:14,760
Come over to my place. I've
something to talk to you about.

521
00:50:15,763 --> 00:50:17,754
But I don't know your house.

522
00:50:17,832 --> 00:50:20,426
Do you know Gyanvapi?
- Yes. I know.

523
00:50:20,501 --> 00:50:24,767
My man will be at Gyanvapi. Blue
shirt, his name's Manohar.

524
00:50:24,839 --> 00:50:26,830
He'll bring you along.

525
00:50:27,775 --> 00:50:29,766
But there'll be two
more people with me.

526
00:50:29,844 --> 00:50:31,835
Your own people?
- Yes, my own people.

527
00:50:31,913 --> 00:50:33,904
Then bring them along, too.

528
00:50:33,981 --> 00:50:35,949
I'm waiting.
- Ok.

529
00:50:52,998 --> 00:50:54,989
Have you done the right thing?

530
00:50:55,067 --> 00:50:57,058
I haven't compelled you to come.

531
00:50:57,185 --> 00:51:00,951
No. I mean that meeting such a
person, will it be suitable?

532
00:51:02,004 --> 00:51:03,995
That's why we've come.

533
00:51:13,118 --> 00:51:15,951
If he talks nonsense, then
I shan't remain quiet.

534
00:51:16,021 --> 00:51:19,616
Why? - Who knows, what
kind of a person he is.

535
00:52:49,485 --> 00:52:54,821
Oh God! Where are you?
- I'm here. I'm in front of you.

536
00:52:55,819 --> 00:52:59,084
No. It's just that...
- Sit. Sit on the mattress...

537
00:52:59,298 --> 00:53:02,201
...or if you want, then on the sofa.

538
00:53:02,598 --> 00:53:07,592
I had a wish to meet you.
I've heard of your job.

539
00:53:07,617 --> 00:53:09,443
Even I've heard of your fame.

540
00:53:09,468 --> 00:53:13,258
Why are you saying fame? Say
defame, tell the truth.

541
00:53:15,344 --> 00:53:18,780
Is that boy your brother?
- No. A cousin.

542
00:53:19,348 --> 00:53:22,603
My uncle's son.
- And him?

543
00:53:22,604 --> 00:53:25,617
Uncle?
- He's my friend.

544
00:53:34,630 --> 00:53:36,621
All are Lal!

545
00:53:40,948 --> 00:53:42,939
Bring cold drinks.

546
00:53:45,641 --> 00:53:48,303
We ate before we came. Lunch.

547
00:53:48,644 --> 00:53:51,306
So what if you've eaten?
You've walked from that...

548
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:54,645
...Calcutta lodge to our house.
That food must've gotten digested.

549
00:53:56,602 --> 00:54:00,925
What're you saying?
- It's your wish. What shall I say?

550
00:54:08,330 --> 00:54:11,265
Have you come to Benaras
for a holiday?

551
00:54:11,767 --> 00:54:14,600
That was my intention.
- If that was your intention...

552
00:54:14,670 --> 00:54:16,661
...then why did you change your mind?

553
00:54:22,611 --> 00:54:26,274
It's my mind, after all. Where's
the restriction of changing it?

554
00:54:26,348 --> 00:54:30,284
There's no restriction, but why
are you wasting your time?

555
00:54:31,353 --> 00:54:33,344
Go and visit the various temples.

556
00:54:33,422 --> 00:54:37,290
I've my own boat, you can
visit all the 80 banks...

557
00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:41,295
...and it won't cost you
even a single penny.

558
00:54:41,363 --> 00:54:43,354
Your mind will be refreshed breathing...

559
00:54:43,432 --> 00:54:45,423
...the air of the Ganges...

560
00:54:45,501 --> 00:54:48,299
...instead of doing all
this, why are you...

561
00:54:48,370 --> 00:54:52,057
...wasting your time at
the Ghoshal's house?

562
00:54:53,475 --> 00:54:56,808
You're forgetting that I'm
a professional detective.

563
00:54:56,879 --> 00:54:59,313
Mr. Ghoshal has given me a job.

564
00:54:59,381 --> 00:55:01,863
The question of refusing
it doesn't arise.

565
00:55:10,122 --> 00:55:13,956
What's your fee?
- It depends on the job.

566
00:55:22,529 --> 00:55:26,363
It's Rs. 2000. Take the money
and stop your job.

567
00:55:31,777 --> 00:55:35,110
I don't charge any money,
without working for it.

568
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:38,946
Work? What'll you
achieve by working?

569
00:55:39,017 --> 00:55:41,611
You won't be able to do anything
after catching the thief.

570
00:55:41,954 --> 00:55:45,117
Why?
- The thief is your client, himself.

571
00:55:46,692 --> 00:55:48,683
What are you saying?

572
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:51,627
Do you know that Mana Ghoshal
has stolen the...

573
00:55:51,697 --> 00:55:53,688
...Ganesha from his father's trunk...

574
00:55:53,765 --> 00:55:55,756
...and sold it to me for Rs. 30000?

575
00:55:55,968 --> 00:55:58,630
Do you know how weak
he is, financially?

576
00:55:58,971 --> 00:56:00,905
Do you know how much
he has to repay?

577
00:56:01,073 --> 00:56:04,565
Will you go and tell his father
that his son has stolen the...

578
00:56:04,643 --> 00:56:06,634
...Ganesha from his trunk?

579
00:56:06,912 --> 00:56:08,903
He had refused you.

580
00:56:09,648 --> 00:56:12,583
He changed his mind, after refusing.

581
00:56:12,787 --> 00:56:15,449
After changing his mind,
the next day...

582
00:56:15,654 --> 00:56:19,590
...he gave me the idol at
the ashram of Machlibaba.

583
00:56:19,658 --> 00:56:23,924
And I had given him
300 Rs. 100 notes.

584
00:56:24,223 --> 00:56:27,158
We visited the ashram, as well
as did our job. That's it.

585
00:56:27,493 --> 00:56:30,155
You're an intelligent man, Mitra.

586
00:56:31,103 --> 00:56:35,597
Not ordinary intelligence, but
extraordinary intelligence.

587
00:56:36,994 --> 00:56:39,215
If you come to know the truth...

588
00:56:39,245 --> 00:56:41,832
...then it'll be a problem
for both of us.

589
00:56:41,968 --> 00:56:44,562
So you take that money,
and give up this job.

590
00:56:44,587 --> 00:56:46,578
This is my request.

591
00:57:11,651 --> 00:57:14,916
Then the Ganesha must be with you.
- Yes.

592
00:57:15,641 --> 00:57:17,632
Can I see it?

593
00:57:17,710 --> 00:57:21,476
What are you saying, Mitra? My
house in Calcutta was raided...

594
00:57:21,547 --> 00:57:24,075
...why would I keep the
idol in my house?

595
00:57:24,483 --> 00:57:27,145
To know whether you're telling
the truth or not...

596
00:57:27,219 --> 00:57:29,483
I've to have a look
at the idol first.

597
00:57:32,536 --> 00:57:34,070
Am I lying?

598
00:57:34,459 --> 00:57:38,493
The opposite of true is false, Maganlal.

599
00:57:40,889 --> 00:57:43,183
You do not believe my words?

600
00:57:46,238 --> 00:57:49,503
There's Rs. 2000 there. Take
and enjoy your holidays.

601
00:57:49,575 --> 00:57:51,956
Take a tour with your uncle.

602
00:58:08,518 --> 00:58:10,509
I don't accept bribes, Maganlal.

603
00:58:17,371 --> 00:58:19,362
Then you'll continue with your work?

604
00:58:24,047 --> 00:58:26,038
Send for Arjun.

605
00:58:26,399 --> 00:58:28,890
Bring box no. 13.

606
00:58:32,484 --> 00:58:37,478
What, Halwamohan? Didn't
you like the juice?

607
00:58:41,493 --> 00:58:46,104
Don't worry, Mohan. That
juice isn't poisoned.

608
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:52,169
I feel that poison is
a very bad thing.

609
00:58:52,504 --> 00:58:54,495
Yes.

610
00:58:57,003 --> 00:58:59,995
Poison is useful for other things.

611
00:59:20,486 --> 00:59:22,477
A collection of knives!

612
00:59:55,863 --> 00:59:59,799
Are you feeling well?
- Just a little fever.

613
00:59:59,902 --> 01:00:03,496
It's alright.
- Will you perform today?

614
01:00:07,910 --> 01:00:09,901
Have you seen knife throwing, sir?

615
01:00:11,584 --> 01:00:14,519
The king of Harbanspur
had a private circus.

616
01:00:15,588 --> 01:00:19,854
The knife thrower of his circus
now performs in mine.

617
01:00:35,157 --> 01:00:39,987
Ok then, shall we go?
- Where will you go?

618
01:00:41,208 --> 01:00:44,648
It's already 2.30...
- So what?

619
01:00:45,167 --> 01:00:48,102
You've to rest a bit.
- No! First, Arjun...

620
01:00:48,170 --> 01:00:52,183
...will perform, only
then will we go.

621
01:00:59,114 --> 01:01:03,149
Are you ready?
- Oh yes! - Then start.

622
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:15,524
Come, Uncle.
- What is your intention?

623
01:01:15,570 --> 01:01:20,993
Uncle stand in front of the board,
and Arjun will perform.

624
01:01:21,403 --> 01:01:23,394
What do you think of yourself?

625
01:01:29,411 --> 01:01:33,074
Hey fool! I shall break your bones!

626
01:01:33,148 --> 01:01:35,139
I had told you to shoot, only
when he pulled out his pistol...

627
01:01:35,217 --> 01:01:37,208
...who told you to shoot now?

628
01:01:37,419 --> 01:01:40,411
Forgive me, sir.
- Is this your aim?

629
01:01:40,489 --> 01:01:45,085
I'll penalize you for this mistake.
- Forgive me, sir.

630
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:47,151
I made a mistake.

631
01:01:47,229 --> 01:01:50,096
Two pistols, two bullets
have been pointed at you.

632
01:01:50,165 --> 01:01:52,771
Don't dare to disobey me!

633
01:01:56,371 --> 01:01:59,363
By not believing me,
you've insulted me.

634
01:01:59,441 --> 01:02:01,432
If you be obedient today,
then nothing will happen.

635
01:02:01,510 --> 01:02:03,501
Not even to Uncle.

636
01:02:03,579 --> 01:02:06,047
But if you investigate
Ghoshal's house again...

637
01:02:06,115 --> 01:02:08,106
...then I won't be able to
guarantee your safety.

638
01:02:08,183 --> 01:02:10,174
I'm clearly warning you.

639
01:02:10,385 --> 01:02:15,049
Get up, Mohan! Get up!

640
01:02:30,020 --> 01:02:32,011
What happened?

641
01:02:43,152 --> 01:02:47,047
Just a minute. Let
me drink the juice.

642
01:03:06,887 --> 01:03:08,878
What have you added to the juice?

643
01:03:10,112 --> 01:03:13,109
I'm feeling amazingly strong.

644
01:03:14,462 --> 01:03:17,454
Arjun, are you ready?
- Yes.

645
01:03:18,387 --> 01:03:24,235
Where do I have to stand? Here?
- Yes. There.

646
01:03:25,941 --> 01:03:28,102
Means, here?
- Yes.

647
01:03:36,138 --> 01:03:38,129
Just a minute.

648
01:03:46,324 --> 01:03:53,164
Here, take my watch. My wallet.

649
01:03:58,742 --> 01:04:01,006
Ready Arjun?
- Yes.

650
01:04:07,914 --> 01:04:09,905
Just a minute.

651
01:04:11,292 --> 01:04:13,283
Just a minute.

652
01:04:25,387 --> 01:04:27,548
Hail Baba Vishwanath!

653
01:04:28,967 --> 01:04:31,902
Wow! That's great!

654
01:04:45,574 --> 01:04:47,565
You're a lion!

655
01:04:55,649 --> 01:04:57,640
Amazing! Good!

656
01:05:43,131 --> 01:05:45,122
Your salary will be increased!

657
01:05:49,237 --> 01:05:51,228
Great!

658
01:05:57,079 --> 01:05:59,070
Wow! Look at it!

659
01:06:17,099 --> 01:06:21,035
I had told you, Mitra.
Arjun is excellent!

660
01:06:24,373 --> 01:06:29,037
Uncle! Come out. The game's up!

661
01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:39,110
Come out!

662
01:06:45,127 --> 01:06:47,118
Lalan Uncle!

663
01:06:55,823 --> 01:06:58,287
Get some milk and nuts for Uncle.

664
01:07:21,416 --> 01:07:24,408
How much?
- What's it normally, for you?

665
01:07:24,433 --> 01:07:28,028
72.
- Then it has to reduce by 25 more.

666
01:07:28,448 --> 01:07:31,110
It'll reduce now.
Immediately reduce.

667
01:07:31,898 --> 01:07:34,833
I'm feeling relived now.
Understood? A lot!

668
01:07:45,912 --> 01:07:48,847
I'm so relieved now!
My head was bursting.

669
01:07:49,254 --> 01:07:53,792
You hadn't seen it. It was
like living 5 lives in one.

670
01:07:57,065 --> 01:07:59,056
They don't say it for no reason...

671
01:07:59,134 --> 01:08:01,716
...that truth is stronger
than fiction.

672
01:08:08,449 --> 01:08:12,283
Go ahead with the case,
I'm with you.

673
01:08:16,566 --> 01:08:23,024
What happened? Hello? Are
you planning to give up?

674
01:08:24,192 --> 01:08:29,357
I'm responsible for what
happened to you, today.

675
01:08:31,366 --> 01:08:33,357
No! What are you saying!

676
01:08:33,435 --> 01:08:36,370
This is just my fate. It's
written in my fate.

677
01:08:37,139 --> 01:08:40,040
But I'm still alive!
Hale and healthy!

678
01:08:41,376 --> 01:08:43,367
Forget what happened, today.

679
01:08:45,113 --> 01:08:47,104
Either I'll take revenge
for this...

680
01:08:47,884 --> 01:08:50,079
...or I'll give up my profession.

681
01:09:01,129 --> 01:09:03,120
What happened?

682
01:09:05,133 --> 01:09:07,124
Are you leaving?

683
01:09:07,575 --> 01:09:09,922
You've a show, the day after.

684
01:09:14,409 --> 01:09:16,400
What happened?

685
01:09:16,478 --> 01:09:19,413
This is dangerous, sir. I
can't stay here any longer.

686
01:09:19,481 --> 01:09:22,296
What happened?
- Don't ask. See.

687
01:09:27,983 --> 01:09:29,974
Beware!

688
01:09:42,588 --> 01:09:44,579
From where did you get this?

689
01:09:44,857 --> 01:09:50,041
It was near the window.
Someone must've left it.

690
01:09:50,066 --> 01:09:53,284
Are you afraid of such threats!?

691
01:09:53,494 --> 01:09:56,691
You would've known, had
you been in my place.

692
01:09:58,878 --> 01:10:02,637
This is a police case. Who wants
to get involved in it?

693
01:10:02,882 --> 01:10:06,608
You've a 17.5 inch tricep...
- Bicep!

694
01:10:06,939 --> 01:10:08,930
And you're afraid of this
ordinary threat?

695
01:10:08,955 --> 01:10:10,946
You aren't able to understand
the matter.

696
01:10:11,024 --> 01:10:15,753
I'm not a coward.
- Then why are you leaving?

697
01:10:17,384 --> 01:10:19,375
Have you seen Angelo's David?

698
01:10:25,171 --> 01:10:27,621
That one? That's something great.

699
01:10:28,104 --> 01:10:33,025
Our body is a work of art. A temple.

700
01:10:34,466 --> 01:10:37,629
And the muscles on that
are the designs.

701
01:10:40,186 --> 01:10:42,848
Did you hear that?
- Amazing.

702
01:10:44,924 --> 01:10:50,694
Did you understand? - Means you've
to take care of your temple.

703
01:10:51,411 --> 01:10:54,676
Isn't that so?
- I can tell you one thing.

704
01:10:54,934 --> 01:10:57,354
You aren't the one who
has been threatened.

705
01:10:57,379 --> 01:10:59,370
I've been threatened.

706
01:11:00,140 --> 01:11:02,131
Your introduction?

707
01:11:02,429 --> 01:11:06,663
His is about this. About
mind and intelligence.

708
01:11:06,980 --> 01:11:11,800
He isn't into building muscles
here and there. Am I right?

709
01:11:12,152 --> 01:11:17,205
I guarantee on thing to you. Even
if something happens here.

710
01:11:17,330 --> 01:11:20,010
Your body will be safe.
- What are you saying?

711
01:11:20,146 --> 01:11:21,872
100% true.

712
01:11:21,897 --> 01:11:25,268
Don't feel afraid. - But don't
let the Bengali club sink.

713
01:11:25,338 --> 01:11:28,273
Everyone sees the Bishwanath
temple in Kashi.

714
01:11:28,608 --> 01:11:31,857
But how many see the
Bishosri temple?

715
01:11:34,614 --> 01:11:36,605
A bowl full of blood.

716
01:11:39,091 --> 01:11:43,357
Did you think of mother Durga
as an ordinary woman?

717
01:11:43,851 --> 01:11:49,448
She hurls the trident into his
chest, and blood spurts out.

718
01:11:49,629 --> 01:11:50,618
Yes.

719
01:13:06,539 --> 01:13:08,530
Did you call for me?

720
01:13:10,705 --> 01:13:12,366
Sit.

721
01:13:24,590 --> 01:13:29,254
I hadn't told you something.
As it can't be said.

722
01:13:29,855 --> 01:13:31,846
But I'm telling it to you.

723
01:13:34,333 --> 01:13:40,272
That day, even if I hadn't seen
someone entering the house...

724
01:13:42,032 --> 01:13:46,969
...I had seen one leaving.
He was a gentleman.

725
01:13:47,489 --> 01:13:50,706
There just two gentlemen in this
house, me and Bikash, Father.

726
01:13:52,537 --> 01:13:59,389
You have hidden your conversation
with Maganlal from me.

727
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:05,052
Maganlal had offered you money...

728
01:14:05,155 --> 01:14:08,033
...I came to know about it
through someone else.

729
01:14:08,078 --> 01:14:11,013
I didn't feel that it was important
for you to know that.

730
01:14:11,038 --> 01:14:14,739
Maganlal had asked for the Ganesha,
but I had refused him.

731
01:14:15,574 --> 01:14:18,236
However if it gets proved that...

732
01:14:18,310 --> 01:14:20,967
...you had opened my trunk...

733
01:14:21,201 --> 01:14:24,105
...then the appropriate
punishment for that...

734
01:14:24,130 --> 01:14:26,121
...you have to face it.

735
01:15:39,133 --> 01:15:42,398
Maganlal hasn't got the Ganesha yet.

736
01:15:43,666 --> 01:15:45,359
He hasn't!?

737
01:15:45,598 --> 01:15:48,260
Had he got it, then he wouldn't
have offered me so much...

738
01:15:48,334 --> 01:15:51,826
...money to stop my work.
- Then where's the Ganesha?

739
01:15:56,972 --> 01:16:01,881
I believe... the Ganesha is
still in Ghoshal's house.

740
01:16:02,366 --> 01:16:06,000
That means Umanath hasn't sold it?

741
01:16:06,357 --> 01:16:11,021
Umanath, had he stolen it, wouldn't...

742
01:16:11,290 --> 01:16:16,487
...have recommended us to his father.

743
01:16:17,509 --> 01:16:23,175
And Raxit?
- Had Bikash stolen it...

744
01:16:23,933 --> 01:16:26,501
...then he wouldn't have stayed here.

745
01:16:27,184 --> 01:16:32,019
That's right. But where
did the Ganesha go?

746
01:16:33,746 --> 01:16:39,582
Who opened the trunk,
why did he do so...

747
01:16:41,248 --> 01:16:44,852
...and why is Maganlal interested
in that idol...

748
01:16:44,877 --> 01:16:47,812
...only mother Ganga knows
about it, till now.

749
01:25:21,092 --> 01:25:23,083
Mr. Mitra!

750
01:25:26,097 --> 01:25:28,088
How are you?
- Fine. How are you?

751
01:25:29,834 --> 01:25:31,825
Fine. I heard that you've started...

752
01:25:31,903 --> 01:25:34,770
...working, even after coming here?
- What to do? There's no one...

753
01:25:34,839 --> 01:25:36,830
...to pay us a salary. We've
to keep doing something.

754
01:25:36,908 --> 01:25:38,899
Will you drink tea?
- Yes.

755
01:25:42,714 --> 01:25:46,661
Tell me.
- Will you take my advice?

756
01:25:46,917 --> 01:25:48,908
First, let me hear
what the advice is.

757
01:25:50,238 --> 01:25:52,662
Have you heard of Maganlal?

758
01:25:52,857 --> 01:25:54,707
Not only have I heard of him...

759
01:25:54,816 --> 01:25:56,807
...I spent an hour
with him yesterday.

760
01:25:56,884 --> 01:25:58,875
What? You didn't tell me about it.

761
01:25:58,953 --> 01:26:00,944
He showed me the performance
of his private circus.

762
01:26:01,022 --> 01:26:02,683
Offered me a drink.

763
01:26:02,757 --> 01:26:06,388
What's your opinion?
- An extraordinary scorpion.

764
01:26:07,028 --> 01:26:11,692
Do you know? There was a theft
in Benaras, a few days back...

765
01:26:11,766 --> 01:26:15,622
...in Mr. Badrinarayars house.
A Nataraj idol.

766
01:26:15,970 --> 01:26:19,133
And Maganlal had been to that
house, 4 days before the theft.

767
01:26:19,707 --> 01:26:22,977
Then what? Search his house,
you'll get the idol

768
01:26:23,212 --> 01:26:25,702
Maganlal isn't such
a foolish person.

769
01:26:25,780 --> 01:26:29,139
Is it your intention to
promote his cunningness?

770
01:26:29,376 --> 01:26:32,311
Forget about the threat to
my life, just tell me...

771
01:26:32,379 --> 01:26:34,370
...will I get your help,
when I need it?

772
01:26:34,448 --> 01:26:39,476
You know that. You've seen
it before in Allahabad.

773
01:27:00,602 --> 01:27:02,593
Lakhan!

774
01:27:12,579 --> 01:27:14,570
Take this.

775
01:27:54,828 --> 01:27:58,984
It's 10:30.
- Were you thinking of eating out?

776
01:28:01,499 --> 01:28:06,084
No. It's the bylanes of Kashi.
A historical feeling.

777
01:28:06,471 --> 01:28:12,985
Moreover, I just wanted to
feel the cold atmosphere.

778
01:28:14,680 --> 01:28:16,671
C'mon.

779
01:28:17,009 --> 01:28:22,003
Is there any African king in
any of your stories? - Yes.

780
01:28:23,393 --> 01:28:28,057
Gorillar Gograj. In it,
King Mahanto. - What?

781
01:28:28,131 --> 01:28:32,067
Have you brought a
gorrilla from there?

782
01:28:33,136 --> 01:28:38,581
That's nothing. Read
my latest book...

783
01:28:38,663 --> 01:28:43,405
...you won't get a chance to look up.

784
01:28:44,095 --> 01:28:47,139
What? How is the story?

785
01:28:48,418 --> 01:28:52,081
Excellent! Especially, the part
where he hides the diamond.

786
01:28:52,155 --> 01:28:56,091
He steals a huge diamond,
and hides it in the front...

787
01:28:56,159 --> 01:28:59,424
...I mean, the front portion
of his robe, with cellotape.

788
01:28:59,495 --> 01:29:01,486
Can't it be seen,
even when he moves?

789
01:29:01,564 --> 01:29:03,555
That's the technique, sir.

790
01:29:03,725 --> 01:29:07,127
Even people are shocked
on seeing him.

791
01:29:07,170 --> 01:29:11,106
And this man sees the stone,
and as soon as he does...

792
01:29:12,118 --> 01:29:13,779
Excellent!

793
01:29:14,884 --> 01:29:19,285
I would've been happy,

794
01:29:19,286 --> 01:29:24,486
had there been any noise.

795
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:26,551
This is too lonely.

796
01:29:26,629 --> 01:29:28,620
Has your stock of courage lessened?

797
01:29:28,697 --> 01:29:30,688
No! Do you know what the problem is?

798
01:29:30,766 --> 01:29:32,552
I have the courage.
But not the muscle.

799
01:29:32,577 --> 01:29:36,498
Bagchi's biceps. He has a lot of
it, but doesn't have courage.

800
01:29:36,572 --> 01:29:38,563
Courage is a very special quality.

801
01:29:38,641 --> 01:29:40,506
Are you going home?

802
01:29:40,843 --> 01:29:42,834
I'm going because you're here.

803
01:29:42,912 --> 01:29:45,506
Otherwise, in this street at night?

804
01:29:46,849 --> 01:29:50,182
Have a look at those courtyards,

805
01:29:50,183 --> 01:29:53,516
every house is haunted.

806
01:29:53,856 --> 01:29:57,519
Go inside, and you can see bats
hanging from the ceiling.

807
01:29:57,593 --> 01:30:00,528
I won't be surprised
if I see a vampire.

808
01:30:02,698 --> 01:30:06,244
The bat says that you'll see

809
01:30:06,245 --> 01:30:09,536
something amazing tonight.

810
01:30:11,372 --> 01:30:15,067
Tonight, bats and vampires shall

811
01:30:15,092 --> 01:30:18,325
come, and everyone will die.

812
01:30:27,890 --> 01:30:29,881
Sir!

813
01:30:41,722 --> 01:30:44,885
The Ghoshal house has no connection
with the death of Shashi.

814
01:30:45,367 --> 01:30:48,364
He has been murdered by his son.

815
01:30:49,846 --> 01:30:53,365
It's such that the son had gone
for a movie at late hours.

816
01:30:53,528 --> 01:30:56,463
There was a cold war going on
between the father and the son.

817
01:30:56,531 --> 01:30:58,522
In fact, it's being said
that the son had...

818
01:30:58,600 --> 01:31:00,591
...even threatened his father.

819
01:31:00,668 --> 01:31:04,468
I feel that if I pressure a bit,
then the truth will come out.

820
01:31:21,096 --> 01:31:23,758
Don't mistake me. But
after your arrival...

821
01:31:23,832 --> 01:31:26,767
...the crime rate in
Kashi has increased.

822
01:31:26,835 --> 01:31:28,826
There has been a murder in
Chaukammatha, yesterday.

823
01:31:29,740 --> 01:31:33,573
What's needed now,

824
01:31:34,681 --> 01:31:37,514
is just a brain wave.

825
01:31:38,235 --> 01:31:40,226
You don't believe in all this, sir.

826
01:31:40,720 --> 01:31:42,711
Just take a dip in the river...

827
01:31:42,763 --> 01:31:46,802
...tomorrow morning, you'll see that
your brain has been cleared.

828
01:31:48,127 --> 01:31:50,391
I didn't believe in it for 30 years.

829
01:31:51,482 --> 01:31:56,419
I was troubled by gastritis.
Allopath, homeopath, jinxes...

830
01:31:56,315 --> 01:31:58,306
...ayurveda, I didn't miss anything.

831
01:31:59,585 --> 01:32:03,248
Then I thought one day, what's
the harm in trying it?

832
01:32:03,809 --> 01:32:05,800
Then I woke up at 5, and had a dip.

833
01:32:07,125 --> 01:32:09,784
That's it.

834
01:32:11,121 --> 01:32:13,963
Faith has an effect to some extent,
not in everything.

835
01:32:15,534 --> 01:32:20,198
Is there any program?
- Yes. Akhtar's music show.

836
01:32:20,272 --> 01:32:23,484
Is it today? - No. It was supposed
to be on Saturday...

837
01:32:23,509 --> 01:32:26,693
...singers were supposed
to come from Lucknow.

838
01:32:30,282 --> 01:32:32,273
Don't you change the towels?

839
01:32:37,556 --> 01:32:40,108
What happened? You're
looking tense.

840
01:32:40,133 --> 01:32:42,124
Won't you have your breakfast?

841
01:32:51,051 --> 01:32:53,042
I'm being drawn towards one thing.

842
01:32:53,806 --> 01:32:55,298
Drawn!?

843
01:32:57,296 --> 01:33:02,585
Africa's king, Shashi's

844
01:33:04,842 --> 01:33:06,833
and Akhtar's song.

845
01:33:07,586 --> 01:33:13,916
Huh! The dot, the cat's hobby,
and Gopal's mother.

846
01:33:14,495 --> 01:33:18,363
Is that 'Singh', a Punjabi surname,
or a Bihari surname?

847
01:33:18,388 --> 01:33:22,895
Or is it the horn of a cow, goat,
deer, or anything else?

848
01:33:30,543 --> 01:33:33,205
What's the first thing that hits
your mind on hearing of Africa?

849
01:33:33,279 --> 01:33:37,474
Jungle.
- And jungle? - Animal.

850
01:33:37,979 --> 01:33:39,970
And king of animals?

851
01:34:03,309 --> 01:34:05,300
Where's Rukku? He isn't to be seen.

852
01:34:05,377 --> 01:34:08,244
He has been sitting in the room
on the terrace, since morning.

853
01:34:08,314 --> 01:34:12,250
Why? - The idol was being
established, and he tripped over it.

854
01:34:12,318 --> 01:34:14,309
And naturally it was...

855
01:34:30,979 --> 01:34:33,641
I've brought a revolver,
won't you see?

856
01:34:34,409 --> 01:34:38,780
Where's the revolver? - Open the
door, and I'll show it to you.

857
01:34:56,562 --> 01:35:00,225
Here, see it. This
is a real revolver.

858
01:35:00,468 --> 01:35:03,733
Its name is Colt. It has 6 bullets.

859
01:35:21,253 --> 01:35:25,189
The king of Africa is the vehicle
of Goddess Durga, the lion.

860
01:35:25,257 --> 01:35:28,192
And you have hidden the Ganesha
in the lion's mouth...

861
01:35:28,260 --> 01:35:30,194
...with chewing gum.

862
01:35:30,262 --> 01:35:32,526
Isn't it so? - Else, Gondariya
would've taken it away.

863
01:35:32,598 --> 01:35:34,957
He had told father that
he would take it way.

864
01:35:35,107 --> 01:35:37,632
Gondariya is Captain Spark's enemy.

865
01:35:39,978 --> 01:35:45,974
You had heard it.
- Yes. - What happened after that?

866
01:35:46,724 --> 01:35:49,386
After that, I went to Raxit.

867
01:35:49,721 --> 01:35:53,471
Raxit, a man has come, downstairs.

868
01:35:53,549 --> 01:35:56,660
He's saying that he'll
buy your Ganesha.

869
01:35:56,728 --> 01:35:58,719
He's saying that he'll buy it?
- Yes.

870
01:35:58,797 --> 01:36:03,666
Who is that?
- Dacoit Gandariya alias Maganlal.

871
01:36:03,735 --> 01:36:07,000
He's talking to Father. He'll
give him a lot of money.

872
01:36:11,176 --> 01:36:13,667
He's saying that he'll
give a lot of money?

873
01:36:14,368 --> 01:36:17,469
It isn't sounding good,
Captain Spark.

874
01:36:17,683 --> 01:36:19,674
C'mon. Let's hide the Ganesha.

875
01:36:19,751 --> 01:36:21,742
Where do we hide it?

876
01:36:21,820 --> 01:36:25,620
That day, you told me a story
that a man had hidden a...

877
01:36:25,691 --> 01:36:27,682
...diamond, within his
crocodile skin dress.

878
01:36:27,759 --> 01:36:30,626
Similarly, we, too, will hide
it in the mouth of the lion.

879
01:36:30,696 --> 01:36:35,963
Lion!? - The vehicle of
Goddess Durga. - Ok.

880
01:36:38,970 --> 01:36:41,632
And if he asks you, then tell him...

881
01:36:41,707 --> 01:36:44,642
...that it's with the king of Africa.

882
01:36:44,710 --> 01:36:49,647
Ok. - And we shall remove it
on the day of the immersion.

883
01:36:49,715 --> 01:36:52,980
Else, it'll sink along with the
idol, into the deep waters.

884
01:36:53,276 --> 01:36:59,215
Did you hear the old man's antics?
- Yes. I did.

885
01:37:00,523 --> 01:37:05,187
But the one who is acting
behind your back... - What?

886
01:37:05,509 --> 01:37:07,600
Let me introduce him to you.

887
01:37:08,539 --> 01:37:09,903
Know him.

888
01:37:11,808 --> 01:37:15,272
No one's imagination
can match that of his.

889
01:37:16,707 --> 01:37:20,370
He's the writer of 'Kamal
Kanya', Jatayu.

890
01:37:20,395 --> 01:37:23,330
Jatayu! Are you Jatayu?

891
01:37:23,242 --> 01:37:26,507
He's just exaggerating things.
I'm nothing of that kind.

892
01:37:26,578 --> 01:37:29,513
Then, my Ganesha was
saved because of you.

893
01:37:29,911 --> 01:37:33,506
But the Ganesha isn't there.
- What?

894
01:37:33,849 --> 01:37:35,840
There's nothing in the lion's mouth.

895
01:37:35,917 --> 01:37:37,908
Only the chewing gum is there.

896
01:37:45,385 --> 01:37:49,321
You had called for me, to
catch the thief, isn't it?

897
01:37:49,598 --> 01:37:52,533
That's true. There was
nothing in the trunk...

898
01:37:52,601 --> 01:37:54,592
...when the thief came.

899
01:37:54,670 --> 01:37:57,537
But we've to see who fiddled
with my trunk.

900
01:37:57,606 --> 01:38:00,871
The one who has the
wrong intentions.

901
01:38:00,942 --> 01:38:05,538
Not only wrong intentions, but he
has also taken wrong actions.

902
01:38:14,890 --> 01:38:17,381
I had sent Bikash to buy sweets.
- Where?

903
01:38:17,498 --> 01:38:23,752
You can find him, if you go, now.

904
01:38:43,472 --> 01:38:47,366
What do you think?
- About what?

905
01:38:47,590 --> 01:38:50,525
About Bikash's status.
- Bikash is a lion.

906
01:38:58,531 --> 01:39:03,468
Tell me, Mitra. Where? Ram temple?

907
01:39:03,755 --> 01:39:05,746
Ok. Alright.

908
01:39:38,250 --> 01:39:41,466
Good morning. I was
searching for you.

909
01:39:41,532 --> 01:39:44,873
Me? - I had to talk to you
about something. - Now?

910
01:39:44,898 --> 01:39:46,889
It's important. It
can't be told here.

911
01:39:46,967 --> 01:39:48,958
Let's find a lonely place.

912
01:39:49,036 --> 01:39:51,834
But, I was...
- You can buy the sweets later.

913
01:39:51,916 --> 01:39:53,907
C'mon now. We shall come back.
- Ok.

914
01:39:54,628 --> 01:39:58,621
The thing tickling your
hips, is a fire weapon.

915
01:39:58,646 --> 01:40:00,637
Don't try to escape!

916
01:40:39,486 --> 01:40:41,477
Sit.

917
01:40:45,388 --> 01:40:50,223
The one whose lie has been caught,
he can't be trusted anymore.

918
01:40:51,561 --> 01:40:53,552
You weren't listening
to the radio that day.

919
01:40:54,017 --> 01:40:56,008
You were listening to Maganlal's
conversation.

920
01:40:56,733 --> 01:40:59,930
Isn't it so? Tell me.

921
01:41:01,950 --> 01:41:04,612
Tell me what happened next.

922
01:41:04,637 --> 01:41:07,572
If you lie, you'll get
trapped further.

923
01:41:07,907 --> 01:41:09,568
Speak up.

924
01:41:10,910 --> 01:41:15,574
Maganlal saw that I was listening
to him, secretly.

925
01:41:15,658 --> 01:41:19,253
After that?
- He sends for me the next day.

926
01:41:19,586 --> 01:41:21,577
He gives me an advance of Rs. 500.

927
01:41:21,654 --> 01:41:25,021
Says that he'll give me another
Rs. 500 if I steal the Ganesha.

928
01:41:25,592 --> 01:41:28,445
And a job in Kolkata.

929
01:41:28,446 --> 01:41:32,521
I don't have any future here.

930
01:41:32,599 --> 01:41:36,865
Believe me! - After that?
What happened after that?

931
01:41:36,936 --> 01:41:40,872
I opened the trunk, but
the Ganesha wasn't there.

932
01:41:42,262 --> 01:41:47,097
Then, last evening, I was in my
room at that time, suddenly...

933
01:41:57,824 --> 01:42:01,089
I haven't committed any sin, sir.

934
01:42:01,895 --> 01:42:04,557
I swear on God.

935
01:42:04,631 --> 01:42:07,896
Believe me!
- Where did you get it?

936
01:42:07,921 --> 01:42:14,455
It was... it was in front of
the idol. On the floor.

937
01:42:14,908 --> 01:42:17,843
I don't know who kept it there.

938
01:42:19,579 --> 01:42:22,514
This... give this to Mr. Ghoshal.

939
01:42:23,125 --> 01:42:26,060
I went to Maganlal with the
Ganesha, that very night.

940
01:42:47,409 --> 01:42:49,400
Sit.

941
01:42:52,244 --> 01:42:54,235
Where did you get this?

942
01:42:55,035 --> 01:42:57,970
It was in front of the
idol, in our house.

943
01:42:58,178 --> 01:43:01,113
I didn't find it.
- You didn't find it?

944
01:43:01,448 --> 01:43:04,611
Shashi Babu.
- Shashi Babu?

945
01:43:05,185 --> 01:43:07,619
Our sculptor, he gave it to me.

946
01:43:09,896 --> 01:43:13,397
He won't tell anyone.

947
01:43:15,448 --> 01:43:19,614
He's a very good person.

948
01:43:19,639 --> 01:43:22,506
Moreover, he isn't that
kind of a person.

949
01:43:23,576 --> 01:43:25,567
Where is he now?

950
01:43:29,582 --> 01:43:31,857
He is a very good man.

951
01:43:31,858 --> 01:43:36,511
I mean, coolheaded. He
is about 70 years old.

952
01:43:37,857 --> 01:43:40,519
Where is he now? In his house?

953
01:43:42,128 --> 01:43:44,119
Do you know his house?

954
01:43:51,835 --> 01:43:53,826
I won't be able to...

955
01:43:53,851 --> 01:43:57,719
I know what you can do
and what you can't.

956
01:43:58,406 --> 01:44:03,600
You just show it to us,
the rest will...

957
01:44:05,078 --> 01:44:09,014
...be taken care of by someone else.

958
01:44:14,894 --> 01:44:17,556
I haven't committed the murder.

959
01:44:17,830 --> 01:44:20,993
Believe me, Mitra. I haven't
committed the crime.

960
01:44:21,834 --> 01:44:24,496
It would've been alright hadn't
you told about that.

961
01:44:25,203 --> 01:44:27,467
You wouldn't have been
able to do that thing.

962
01:44:28,404 --> 01:44:32,388
Come, Tiwari. As of now,
he's your guest.

963
01:44:34,166 --> 01:44:36,157
He's just a part of the plot.

964
01:44:36,923 --> 01:44:38,914
There're many more to come.

965
01:44:39,817 --> 01:44:41,808
Come. Come with me.

966
01:44:47,934 --> 01:44:49,925
Is this that thing?
- Yes.

967
01:44:50,612 --> 01:44:52,603
Tell me the spelling.

968
01:45:03,562 --> 01:45:05,553
Now write, deltoid.

969
01:45:11,224 --> 01:45:14,887
Wow! Is it deltoir?
- No. Deltoid.

970
01:45:14,961 --> 01:45:16,895
Its 'd' not 'r' ?
- No.

971
01:45:17,164 --> 01:45:19,826
Call for you?
- For me?

972
01:45:25,972 --> 01:45:28,856
Listen, you've some work
to do. Listen carefully.

973
01:45:28,909 --> 01:45:30,900
This evening at 5,
you and Jatayu...

974
01:45:30,977 --> 01:45:33,498
...will come to Machlibaba's ashram.

975
01:45:34,364 --> 01:45:37,848
Exactly at 5.
- And you? - I'll meet you.

976
01:45:37,918 --> 01:45:40,790
It's something serious.
- I've understood.

977
01:45:40,815 --> 01:45:45,752
And at around 3, a member of the
Bengali club, Shushanto Ghosh...

978
01:45:46,595 --> 01:45:49,860
...will visit your place with
makeup and dresses. - Ok.

979
01:45:51,333 --> 01:45:53,324
And take care that Lal Mohan
doesn't act over smart.

980
01:45:54,154 --> 01:45:57,089
It's something serious. And
bring something to eat.

981
01:45:57,114 --> 01:45:59,105
I haven't eaten anything all day.

982
01:45:59,426 --> 01:46:01,417
I understand, but...

983
01:46:38,398 --> 01:46:40,389
Hail Shiva!

984
01:46:58,151 --> 01:47:01,086
What's this?
- Eatable.

985
01:47:23,376 --> 01:47:26,038
He'll come on time. Keep quiet.

986
01:47:38,391 --> 01:47:40,382
Look back.

987
01:50:46,139 --> 01:50:48,630
You've just seen a bullet, Maganlal.

988
01:50:50,722 --> 01:50:56,718
But you haven't seen a noose.

989
01:50:58,834 --> 01:51:01,826
Arrested! - You've been
caught red-handed!

990
01:51:04,011 --> 01:51:08,675
Now, you've to see the performance
of my private circus.

991
01:51:11,776 --> 01:51:15,974
How much money do you want?
How much? Tell me.

992
01:51:16,714 --> 01:51:19,649
Those who kill innocent people,
with the help of thugs.

993
01:51:21,719 --> 01:51:25,655
Those who eat out of the
treasures of the country.

994
01:51:27,758 --> 01:51:30,659
They won't be freed,
by coughing up money.

995
01:51:42,740 --> 01:51:48,679
Come, Mr. Tiwari.
- Come, Mr. Meghraj.

996
01:52:00,939 --> 01:52:03,931
Here, I've given my autograph.
- Ok.

997
01:52:04,028 --> 01:52:06,690
I shall send two more books
after reaching Kolkata.

998
01:52:08,977 --> 01:52:11,639
Do you know him, dear?
- Who?

999
01:52:11,924 --> 01:52:14,586
He's Captain Falu's assistant.

1000
01:52:15,206 --> 01:52:17,640
What's the name?
- Captain Taxit.

1001
01:52:18,142 --> 01:52:23,637
I understood all that. But why
hasn't Captain Falu arrived yet?

1002
01:52:23,981 --> 01:52:26,643
He'll come. He'll come
within an hour or two.

1003
01:52:26,717 --> 01:52:29,652
He has to change his dress,
and remove the makeup.

1004
01:52:29,720 --> 01:52:31,711
But he doesn't go back on his word.

1005
01:52:31,789 --> 01:52:33,780
But I haven't come to know whether...

1006
01:52:33,858 --> 01:52:36,986
...I got back the Ganesha or not.
- Are you still unsure?

1007
01:52:38,829 --> 01:52:40,820
Don't misunderstand. I got delayed...

1008
01:52:40,898 --> 01:52:42,991
...as I had to attend to another job.

1009
01:52:44,555 --> 01:52:47,843
Here, take your Ganesha.
- Ganesha!

1010
01:52:51,607 --> 01:52:53,598
Thanks God!

1011
01:52:54,462 --> 01:52:57,124
What you showed, can only
be read in books.

1012
01:52:57,465 --> 01:53:00,127
Will you let me see it?
- Here, have a look.

1013
01:53:02,938 --> 01:53:04,929
You're incomparable.

1014
01:53:06,709 --> 01:53:08,700
Let me put it back in its place.
- Yes.

1015
01:53:11,535 --> 01:53:13,526
It's an old treasure of mine.

1016
01:53:18,621 --> 01:53:22,557
Go back to your house. Go
back to your house, O Lord!

1017
01:53:30,810 --> 01:53:33,270
Let us have some sweets
to celebrate.

1018
01:53:33,958 --> 01:53:35,619
I've work.

1019
01:53:41,356 --> 01:53:44,848
You'll refuse if I give you
anything more than your fees.

1020
01:53:47,564 --> 01:53:49,555
Before you write the
check, I would...

1021
01:53:49,580 --> 01:53:51,571
...like to show you something else.

1022
01:53:51,760 --> 01:53:53,887
You can. Why do you need
permission for that?

1023
01:53:55,197 --> 01:53:58,860
Then see. See carefully.

1024
01:54:01,402 --> 01:54:05,902
Here, I opened the garage.

1025
01:54:07,076 --> 01:54:09,845
This is the key.

1026
01:54:13,928 --> 01:54:17,125
Now, I open the trunk.

1027
01:54:26,041 --> 01:54:29,868
Here's the result of my action.

1028
01:54:29,893 --> 01:54:32,732
What was your action?

1029
01:54:32,757 --> 01:54:38,423
You may be reading a lot
of detective novels...

1030
01:54:38,496 --> 01:54:40,487
...but I'm a detective myself.

1031
01:54:40,565 --> 01:54:42,556
It isn't easy to fool me.

1032
01:54:48,773 --> 01:54:54,439
I've investigated. The price of
this can't be more than Rs. 1000.

1033
01:54:55,513 --> 01:54:58,448
Had this been the real Ganesha,
then you wouldn't...

1034
01:54:58,516 --> 01:55:02,452
...have hidden it in the lion's
mouth, along with your grandson.

1035
01:55:02,787 --> 01:55:07,781
Am I right?
- You're a genius.

1036
01:55:08,003 --> 01:55:10,836
Your actual Ganesha is
in the bank, isn't it?

1037
01:55:10,861 --> 01:55:14,456
Yes. Of course. Everyone
wants to see it.

1038
01:55:14,532 --> 01:55:17,399
And I've to open the trunk
for that, every time.

1039
01:55:17,468 --> 01:55:19,902
It's such a costly thing.
A work of art.

1040
01:55:20,738 --> 01:55:22,729
Did you hear it, Captain Spark?

1041
01:55:22,807 --> 01:55:24,798
Your grandfather had hidden
the actual Ganesha.

1042
01:55:24,875 --> 01:55:27,742
That's why, I'm taking
this fake Ganesha. Ok?

1043
01:55:27,923 --> 01:55:32,519
Is this the fruit of your actions?
- Yes. My fruit.

1044
01:55:32,750 --> 01:55:34,445
What do you say?

1045
01:55:34,518 --> 01:55:38,420
You're a genius. The one
who's so intelligent...

1046
01:55:38,489 --> 01:55:40,480
...he can't be fooled easily.

1047
01:55:40,558 --> 01:55:44,756
But how did you get it?
- I know.

1048
01:55:45,496 --> 01:55:48,346
By his intelligence.
