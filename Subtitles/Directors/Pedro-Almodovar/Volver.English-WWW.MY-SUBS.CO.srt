1
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,821
Put some stones in the vase,
or it'll fall over.

2
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:21,163
This bloody wind!

3
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:23,165
Polish the letters well.

4
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:26,001
There are so many widows!

5
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:28,212
The women here live longer than the men.

6
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:29,880
Except poor Mom.

7
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:31,507
Mom was lucky.

8
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:32,925
Raimunda, don't say that!

9
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:36,386
She died in Dad's arms,
and she loved him more than anyone.

10
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:37,763
Burned to death!

11
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:42,351
That's the worst way to die.

12
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:43,894
They were asleep.

13
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:45,562
They didn't even realize.

14
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:48,357
Even so,
how can you say something like that?

15
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:49,983
Hello, Agustina.

16
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:55,072
See you later, Agustina.

17
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:57,116
-Good morning, Manola.
-Good morning.

18
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,576
-ls that everything, Mom?
-l'll get the rest.

19
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:01,537
This is wonderful!

20
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:02,955
Good Lord!

21
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,415
-ls this Paula?
-Of course.

22
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,834
She's all grown up!

23
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:08,544
Give her a kiss.

24
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:11,421
She's got your father's eyes.

25
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:14,550
-How are you?
-Not good.

26
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:16,051
Don't say that.

27
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,847
l want to give my grave the once-over.

28
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:22,266
With this wind, you can't keep it clean.

29
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:25,394
-lt looks lovely.
-Cleaning it relaxes me.

30
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:29,189
l often come and sit here on my own,
and time goes by.

31
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,067
We're going now,
we have to see Aunt Paula.

32
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,485
Come and see me afterwards.

33
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,237
Sure.

34
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:37,573
How's Paco?

35
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:40,409
He's fine. He stayed in Madrid, working.

36
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:44,246
Mom,

37
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:46,874
does Agustina really come and clean
her own grave?

38
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:48,917
Yes, it's the custom here.

39
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,545
They buy a plot and look after it
all their lives,

40
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:53,088
like a second home.

41
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:56,133
-That freaks me out!
-lt's tradition here.

42
00:02:57,385 --> 00:02:59,344
-Shall l drive?
-Yes.

43
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:25,204
Aunt Paula!

44
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,164
Who is it?

45
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:28,373
Raimunda!

46
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,792
-Don't take all day.
-Don't rush me.

47
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,920
l don't like going back in the dark.

48
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:35,088
Be nice to Auntie, don't laugh at her.

49
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:36,173
All right.

50
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:38,258
This house still smells of Mom.

51
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:40,010
How are you, Aunt?

52
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:44,473
You're very thin! Have you had the baby?

53
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:46,266
Fourteen years ago.

54
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:47,809
Doesn't time fly!

55
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,019
And who are these?

56
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:51,647
Who do you think? Sole and my Paula!

57
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,315
The same name as me!

58
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:56,944
And Sole.

59
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:00,948
Shall we go into the dining room?

60
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:05,994
That Sole looks like a right sourpuss.

61
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:07,663
For heaven's sake!

62
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:13,835
The wind carried the cinders to the bushes.

63
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,757
The result is the most tragic fire
in the last 13 years.

64
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:21,510
-Mind if l turn it off?
-No, l can't see it anyway.

65
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:25,180
Fires are dreadful.

66
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,140
That's how your grandparents died.

67
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:29,017
Why did l come in here?

68
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:31,186
l don't know.

69
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:33,397
-To talk?
-No.

70
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:35,607
-To get some food?
-Yes!

71
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:37,526
Look in the sideboard.

72
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:41,071
l'm very shaky on my pins.

73
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,532
Look, wafers!

74
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:45,659
Just like Mom's. Eat up.

75
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:50,038
How was the cemetery?

76
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,874
Your mother is delighted.

77
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,835
Did you scrub the headstone properly?

78
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:56,545
Of course.

79
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:58,297
She likes it to be clean.

80
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:00,632
lf she could, she'd clean it herself.

81
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:02,926
But, of course, she can't.

82
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:06,513
Of course, she can't.

83
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:09,891
Don't you feel lonely in this big house?

84
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:11,393
No.

85
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:14,730
You'd be better off in a home,
where you'd be looked after.

86
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,857
l'm fine as l am.

87
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:18,483
l'm going to the bathroom.

88
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:19,860
Well, go!

89
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:25,324
You can't live on your own.
l'm worried about you.

90
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:27,200
How do you manage your meals?

91
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:28,243
Very well.

92
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:31,330
Agustina brings me bread,
your mother does the cooking,

93
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:34,124
and if l need anything l call the store
and they bring it.

94
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,168
l'm fine.

95
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:25,258
What a lovely touch!

96
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,387
Look!

97
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:30,430
lt's got your name on it.

98
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:33,642
Shall we go?

99
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:35,894
Yes.

100
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,397
We're leaving now.

101
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:40,941
l'm so shaky on my pins.

102
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:42,150
Don't get up.

103
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,319
How could l not get up?

104
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:49,783
Next time l come back,
l'm taking you home with me.

105
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,868
Yes, next time.

106
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:54,496
What matters is that you come back.

107
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,832
You've gotten very wobbly.

108
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:20,230
Take care of yourself.

109
00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:21,440
l will.

110
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:27,487
Mind how you go!

111
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:30,198
We'll do that. l love you lots!

112
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:34,119
-Shall we go to Agustina's?
-Yes.

113
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:44,963
Come in!

114
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:48,884
Well?

115
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,510
How did you find your aunt?

116
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,220
-Bad.
-Terrible.

117
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,764
She's gotten very shaky.
l don't know how she copes.

118
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:57,309
She does very well without going outside.

119
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:59,728
She eats a stick of bread every day.

120
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,730
She leaves the money for me.

121
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:02,939
Let's go onto the patio.

122
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:06,067
She's in an awful state, love.

123
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,777
She doesn't know what year it is.

124
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:10,405
She talks about Mom
as if she were still alive.

125
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,241
For her, she isn't dead.

126
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:15,160
She can't accept it.

127
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:17,037
Sit down for a while.

128
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:20,582
l'd like to pay you something
to look in on her every day.

129
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:23,084
l won't accept anything!

130
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:25,170
l'm very happy to do it.

131
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:26,338
l'd take her home,

132
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:29,216
but l'd have to throw my husband out
to make room.

133
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:30,926
But we have to do something.

134
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:34,221
Every morning, before l go shopping,
l tap on her window

135
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:37,807
and l don't move until she answers me.

136
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:39,684
l keep an eye on her.

137
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,937
l really appreciate that.

138
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,274
l like to think

139
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:49,736
someone's doing that for my mother,

140
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,196
wherever she is.

141
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:59,829
Look! Wasn't she cutting edge then?

142
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,625
The only hippie in the village.

143
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:06,378
Look at her plastic jewelry.

144
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:10,173
They're awesome!

145
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:11,800
First-rate plastic.

146
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,723
Every time l smoke a joint l think of her.

147
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:21,685
That's a fine example you're setting
for Paula!

148
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:23,728
There's still no news?

149
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:24,980
Nothing.

150
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:27,232
lt's like the earth swallowed her up.

151
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:28,650
And your sister Brigida?

152
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:29,734
Her?

153
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:32,529
She's in Madrid, she's a big hit on trash TV.

154
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:37,492
Mom, l'm out of credit!

155
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:40,829
Good, we'll get a break from the telephone.

156
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:42,163
You can use mine.

157
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:44,499
-She'll bankrupt you.
-ln that case, no.

158
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:47,877
As l was saying,
Brigida is on so many shows

159
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:50,088
she can put a deposit
on an apartment in Madrid.

160
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:52,132
And she's going to make a record.

161
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:53,967
She always liked singing.

162
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,510
So did this one.

163
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,512
Remember when you and she,

164
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:59,431
you must've been thirteen,

165
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:01,975
went to an audition for child singers?

166
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:05,395
Hey, you never told me that!

167
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:08,064
lt was your granny's idea.
She was up for anything.

168
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:10,525
Talking of mothers,
maybe yours hasn't shown up

169
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:12,444
so as not to ruin your sister's career.

170
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:14,237
No.

171
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:16,364
Mom would love to be on television.

172
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:20,035
She'd go crazy.

173
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:21,202
Want some?

174
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,954
No, no, no.

175
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:25,874
l grow it myself. Look at the plants.

176
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:30,003
We have to leave.

177
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,212
Yes.

178
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,840
Did you report her disappearance
to the police?

179
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:36,217
Brigida thinks it isn't necessary.

180
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,928
She's said it so often on TV.

181
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:42,766
Yes, but you have to report it to the police,
not say it on TV.

182
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:44,726
l don't know.

183
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,481
ln any case, it's not the first time
she's left home.

184
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:52,108
But never for so long.

185
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:54,194
lt's been over three years.

186
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:56,029
Don't give up hope.

187
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:58,740
And take care of yourself,
you don't look well.

188
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:00,325
Your oleander looks wonderful.

189
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:02,577
Yes, it didn't get aphids this year.

190
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,246
But l've really lost my appetite.

191
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:06,414
Maybe it's the joints.

192
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:10,168
No, if it weren't for them,
l wouldn't eat at all.

193
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:15,256
Your father's eyes.

194
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:22,263
A joint makes me feel a bit hungry,
and it relaxes me.

195
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,395
Safe journey!

196
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:45,203
Guess what l saw upstairs
beside the bathroom?

197
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:47,622
What?

198
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:49,541
An exercise bike.

199
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,084
That freaks me out!

200
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:53,962
Why would Auntie want a bike
if she can't walk?

201
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:56,923
Exactly, she's lost her mind.

202
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:59,634
Don't talk like that about her.

203
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,970
She didn't even recognize us.

204
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:04,597
lt's the wind.

205
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,809
That goddamn East wind here
drives people crazy!

206
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:12,313
The wafers are delicious.

207
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:15,400
How can she bake those
when she's as blind as a bat?

208
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:42,719
Hello, Regina.

209
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:43,887
Going to work?

210
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:45,555
Got no choice, love.

211
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:47,515
Why not give her a lift?

212
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:48,558
Where are you going?

213
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:51,895
To the club.
lf you drop me in the center that'd be great.

214
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:53,563
-All right.
-Thanks.

215
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:55,356
See you later.

216
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,041
-Hi, Dad.
-Hi.

217
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,125
Hello.

218
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:23,009
Well?

219
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:25,220
Did you have fun?

220
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:28,556
ln the cemetery? You kidding me?

221
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:34,062
Were you having a party?

222
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:36,064
Me? What do you mean?

223
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:39,859
Paula, sit properly. Close your legs!

224
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:43,905
Will you bring me another beer?

225
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:46,032
Are you kidding?

226
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:49,911
Go on, please.

227
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:53,873
Haven't you had enough?
You have to work tomorrow.

228
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:59,337
l'm free tomorrow, and the day after, too.

229
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:00,755
How come?

230
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:03,550
l was fired.

231
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:05,051
Hang on.

232
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:08,096
Christ Almighty!

233
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:12,433
l'll get a job on Sundays,
it's my only free day.

234
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:15,520
l'll get a job.

235
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:17,272
But let me watch the game in peace.

236
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:21,568
You can forget about soccer.

237
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:22,944
There'll be no more cable.

238
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:26,030
We're a poor family, and we'll live like one.

239
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:28,157
Paula, put that phone down!

240
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:31,286
Your supper's here if you want it.

241
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:05,236
Are you angry?

242
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:07,322
No.

243
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:10,575
l'm worried about my aunt.

244
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:12,827
She's worse than ever.

245
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,914
She didn't even recognize Paula and Sole.

246
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:21,461
-l don't know how she manages.
-But she does.

247
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:26,132
Leave me be.

248
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:30,136
What's wrong?

249
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:33,056
l'm worn out, and l have to get up early.

250
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:35,934
l'll do the work.

251
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,438
Don't be a pest!

252
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,239
Don't call me a pest.

253
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:53,076
Sorry.

254
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:19,245
What are you doing here?

255
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:20,705
Waiting for you.

256
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:21,831
What for?

257
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:27,962
l called you loads of times to tell you
to buy bread.

258
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:30,131
l don't suppose you thought to buy any.

259
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:31,215
No.

260
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,301
You're soaked.

261
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:36,012
How long have you been here?

262
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:37,597
A while.

263
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:43,102
Where were you? With your pals?

264
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:45,146
No.

265
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:48,149
l wasn't anywhere.

266
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:50,151
Why didn't you answer the phone?

267
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:53,488
What's wrong?

268
00:17:58,035 --> 00:17:59,494
ls something wrong?

269
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,290
Tell me, what's happened?

270
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:12,173
Where's your father?

271
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:18,012
He's...

272
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,305
Where?

273
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:22,600
ln the kitchen.

274
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:35,613
What happened?

275
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:38,741
l was in the kitchen

276
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:41,369
with my back to him,

277
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:45,039
and suddenly Dad jumped on me.

278
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,208
He was drunk.

279
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:49,127
l asked him what he was doing,

280
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,462
and he said he wasn't my father.

281
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:55,883
l pushed him away.

282
00:18:57,594 --> 00:19:00,096
But he got up and put his arms around me.

283
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:04,058
l pushed him again.

284
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,316
He unzipped his pants.

285
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:15,486
He kept saying that it wasn't wrong

286
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,155
and that he wasn't my father!

287
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:24,871
l took a knife from the drawer

288
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:26,998
and l threatened him,

289
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:29,167
but it was only to scare him.

290
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,339
He didn't believe me.

291
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:39,218
He said l wouldn't dare

292
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,014
and he jumped on me.

293
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,522
What are you going to do?

294
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:58,321
l don't know.

295
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:03,242
Go and change, or you'll get pneumonia.

296
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:12,418
Remember, l killed him,

297
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,795
and you saw nothing, you weren't here.

298
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:18,925
lt's very important you remember that.

299
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:06,741
Don't open!

300
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:08,576
Who can it be?

301
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:10,202
l don't know.

302
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:11,245
Go to your room.

303
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:15,291
Raimunda, it's me, Emilio.

304
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:19,503
Coming!

305
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:28,095
Hi there.

306
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:31,223
l'm sorry, l know it's late, but l'm
going to Barcelona tomorrow.

307
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:35,186
l want to give you the restaurant keys
in case anyone comes to see it.

308
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,523
l don't mind, it's just l'm never at home.

309
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:41,650
What about Paco? He's always here.

310
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:44,612
Paco...

311
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:48,449
He finally got a job.
He's starting tomorrow.

312
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:50,034
Are you hurt?

313
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:53,537
Women's troubles.

314
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:55,623
But now that l think about it,

315
00:22:55,665 --> 00:22:58,626
with Paco working l'll have more free time.

316
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,630
-Give me the keys, l'll sort it out.
-Here.

317
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:04,965
This is my brother's home number.

318
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:06,509
The other is my cell phone.

319
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:10,805
-You're leaving tomorrow?
-ln the morning.

320
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:14,683
Tell me, how much are you asking?

321
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:16,435
l always liked your restaurant.

322
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:18,938
lt's a pity you didn't like the owner, too.

323
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,648
Emilio, please...

324
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:24,276
For the lease, five million,
but it's negotiable.

325
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:28,114
We'll miss you.

326
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:29,990
And l'll miss you girls.

327
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:35,663
-Good luck.
-Thanks.

328
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:42,795
-ls Emilio leaving?
-Yes.

329
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:44,505
Go back to your room.

330
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:46,841
l want to be with you.

331
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:53,931
You'll have to help me later.

332
00:23:57,727 --> 00:23:58,853
Don't answer!

333
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:03,524
lt'll be one of your pals.

334
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:09,655
Answer it, tell them you can't talk.

335
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:11,574
This is no time to be calling.

336
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:16,370
l can't talk...

337
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:19,457
What do you mean? lt's your Aunt Sole.

338
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:20,791
Put your mother on.

339
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:22,668
lt's Aunt Sole.

340
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:25,463
Tell her l'm busy.

341
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:27,339
She's busy now.

342
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:29,341
Put her on, it's important.

343
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:31,385
Take the phone, Mom.

344
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:38,142
Sole, l've got a pile of ironing,

345
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:40,394
and l was out working all afternoon.

346
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:43,105
Agustina rang.

347
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,607
Aunt Paula is dead.

348
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:46,484
When?

349
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:47,735
A little while ago.

350
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:53,240
Aunt Paula is dead.

351
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:59,705
Just a minute ago l was thinking of
bringing her here.

352
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:03,751
She died all alone!

353
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:05,419
Don't cry, pet.

354
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:09,590
Listen, Agustina said we're not to worry.

355
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:12,801
She and Squinty will lay her out
before we get there.

356
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:14,762
Auntie had everything organized.

357
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:18,474
She even chose her coffin
and paid for everything.

358
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:22,311
lt's incredible that she was so lucid
at the end.

359
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:24,605
l can't go to the funeral.

360
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:26,273
l'm truly sorry,

361
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:28,776
but l'm very busy.

362
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,654
How can you not go?
What will people say?

363
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:33,822
l can't go, not remotely.

364
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:37,284
You have to go on your own.

365
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:38,494
On my own?

366
00:25:38,578 --> 00:25:40,788
No way.

367
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:42,957
You know l'm terrified of the dead.

368
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:45,167
But you needn't see Auntie.

369
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:47,461
l'll tell Agustina to make sure of that.

370
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:48,879
And if they ask for you?

371
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:51,590
Say l've had a gallbladder operation.

372
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:53,217
Anything.

373
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:56,136
l'll go later, but today it's not
remotely possible.

374
00:25:56,972 --> 00:26:00,099
l don't understand you.
Auntie loved you so much.

375
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:03,060
And l loved her.

376
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:07,189
l'll explain it to you someday,
and that day, you'll flip.

377
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:08,607
l'm flipping now.

378
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:12,528
Take a tranquilizer.
l'm going to take one, too.

379
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:15,656
And you go tomorrow morning.

380
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:16,699
All right?

381
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:18,242
l guess...

382
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:39,805
The door!

383
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:02,202
Wait!

384
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:10,729
You stay here. Stay here and keep watch.

385
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:15,234
l hope it hasn't changed
since l worked here.

386
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:22,801
DEEP FREEZE

387
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:04,510
Stay where you are!

388
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:06,094
Sorry.

389
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:10,516
What do you want?

390
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:12,518
ls the restaurant open?

391
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,186
No.

392
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:15,646
Why?

393
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:16,855
Give me a hand.

394
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:21,944
We're shooting a film in the area,

395
00:30:22,028 --> 00:30:25,405
and l'm looking for somewhere
we can all eat.

396
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:29,159
Do you know any restaurants around here?

397
00:30:31,287 --> 00:30:33,121
How many are you?

398
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:35,207
25 and 5... 30.

399
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,086
Come on, help me.

400
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:43,757
l can do it for you, if you want.

401
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:46,510
We were going to close today.

402
00:30:46,594 --> 00:30:49,346
So, lunch for 30.

403
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:51,056
At what time?

404
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:54,268
We stop at 3:30, and we're very close.

405
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,936
Around 4:00?

406
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,271
Yeah.

407
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:02,150
And tell me, how much?

408
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:04,111
Ten euros a head.

409
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:05,737
That's fine.

410
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:10,117
l'm sorry l shouted at you,

411
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:12,035
but you scared me.

412
00:31:14,622 --> 00:31:16,665
-Well, l'll see you at 4:00.
-Sure.

413
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:18,125
Thanks a lot.

414
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:22,045
lt's 1 0:00!

415
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:29,303
-Two kilos.
-Give me another two kilos.

416
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:33,557
How much are the potatoes?

417
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:36,852
1 .60 for four kilos.

418
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:38,103
Give me eight kilos.

419
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:39,396
Sure.

420
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:45,277
Hello, Regina.

421
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,863
Hello, you're carting quite a load!

422
00:31:47,947 --> 00:31:50,073
l have to make lunch for 30.

423
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:53,410
-Could you lend me 1 00 euros?
-l'm broke, love.

424
00:31:53,494 --> 00:31:55,871
l've just bought a chunk of pork this big.

425
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:58,457
l could use that. l'll buy it from you.

426
00:31:58,499 --> 00:32:00,334
lt cost me 1 0.80. lt's all l have!

427
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:03,086
l'll pay you tomorrow. Come on!

428
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:04,755
l'll bring it over to you now.

429
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:07,132
-Thanks, love.
-l'll have to diet today.

430
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:08,842
lt'll do you good.

431
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:14,932
Hey, lnes! Back from the village?

432
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:18,101
l got here yesterday. How are you?

433
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:21,605
Did you happen to bring
any sausages or chorizo?

434
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:24,191
l certainly did! The sausages are great.

435
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:26,860
My mother-in-law orders them specially
for me.

436
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:29,613
-l need a kilo or so.
-Why's that?

437
00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:32,407
-l have to cook for 30.
-Who's coming?

438
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:34,409
l'll tell you later.

439
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:36,703
Can l buy them? l'll pay you tomorrow.

440
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:39,456
-Sure, it's no problem.
-Thanks.

441
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:42,668
Did you bring anything sweet?

442
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:45,379
l brought some cookies
that melt in your mouth.

443
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:48,298
With the way your glucose
and cholesterol are,

444
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:50,175
l can't believe you brought cookies.

445
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:53,512
lt's my only vice. Three boxes.

446
00:32:53,554 --> 00:32:55,055
You shouldn't eat them.

447
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:58,725
-What do l do, give them away?
-Sell them to me.

448
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,435
At least let me taste them.

449
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:04,272
You can eat three or four,
but don't stuff yourself.

450
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:07,234
-Bring them round to me, love.
-l'll do that.

451
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:08,527
-Thanks.
-Bye, love.

452
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:10,237
Bye, pet.

You, too?

458
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:43,311
Some pork? lt's delicious.

459
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:21,767
Agustina?

00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:27,981
ls that you?

461
00:34:35,114 --> 00:34:36,239
Soledad,

462
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:38,366
daughter.

463
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:42,662
Sole,

464
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:45,040
l have to talk to you.

465
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:06,645
Sole!

466
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,862
There, there.

467
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:18,198
Take it easy.

468
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:22,869
Where is she?

469
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:25,580
Upstairs, in my mother's room,

470
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:28,542
the best room in the house.

471
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:31,002
l brought her here to give her a better wake.

472
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:33,046
Thank you so much.

473
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:38,093
Come on, we're the principal mourners.

474
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:45,559
Good afternoon.

475
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:48,937
l spoke to your sister.

476
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:50,897
She's just had an operation.

477
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:52,691
Yes, what timing.

478
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:54,901
She said you're not to see the body.

479
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:58,113
Don't worry, you won't have to.

480
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,926
Say hello to Vicenta's daughter.

481
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:26,141
We'll let her rest a while, she's very tired.

482
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:28,685
Come on.

483
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:30,228
Over here.

484
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:38,278
lt was late at night.

485
00:36:39,488 --> 00:36:41,865
l'd had supper,
and l was watching the television.

486
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:46,494
l heard someone knocking at my door.

487
00:36:48,122 --> 00:36:52,167
l wasn't sure, but just then

488
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:54,461
l heard the same noise,

489
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:58,089
and l asked, "Who is it?"

490
00:36:58,132 --> 00:37:01,218
And a voice answered,

491
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:02,510
"Agustina."

492
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:06,473
l wasn't afraid.

493
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:09,476
l went outside, but l saw no one.

494
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:12,437
l looked over at your aunt's house,

495
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,315
and the door seemed to be open.

496
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:17,651
l thought it was odd,

497
00:37:17,693 --> 00:37:20,237
so l went in.

498
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:22,530
l called your aunt,

499
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:25,492
but she didn't answer me.

500
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:27,869
How could she answer me, poor thing?

501
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,164
l went into her room,

502
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:34,417
and l found her there, in bed,

503
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:37,212
as still as a little bird!

504
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:39,673
lt was her spirit that warned you.

505
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:42,926
But was it Paula's spirit or the other one's?

506
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:44,427
One of the two.

507
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:47,806
l can't say who it was, l didn't see.

508
00:37:47,848 --> 00:37:50,600
But just as l'm listening to you now,

509
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:55,355
someone or something warned me that
Paula had died,

510
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:57,941
and opened the door so l could go in.

511
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:01,027
Come into the kitchen.

512
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:11,496
l bet you haven't eaten yet.

513
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:13,498
No.

514
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:16,793
Not since last night, but l'm all right.

515
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:19,921
l thought as much.

516
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:21,131
This'll do you good.

517
00:38:21,215 --> 00:38:24,092
Don't give me any more. That's enough.

518
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:33,560
What did the women mean?

519
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:36,855
lt was just talk.

520
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:38,815
You know what villages are like.

521
00:38:38,899 --> 00:38:41,151
They were talking about my mother.

522
00:38:41,235 --> 00:38:43,320
Some people say they've seen her.

523
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:48,325
They say she came back to look after
your Aunt Paula.

524
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:51,995
Has she not appeared to you?

525
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:54,914
No. What about you?

526
00:38:54,957 --> 00:38:57,584
No, but those things happen.

527
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:59,252
l know.

528
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:03,089
My grandfather, God rest him, appeared
to my grandmother.

529
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:06,426
At first she was frightened.

530
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:07,761
Eat up!

531
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:11,598
Then she asked him what he wanted,

532
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:13,391
and his spirit told her

533
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:16,853
there was a promise he hadn't fulfilled.

534
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:18,855
She carried it out,

535
00:39:18,939 --> 00:39:21,608
and the whole village went with her
to the cemetery,

536
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:24,194
where they left my grandfather so he'd
rest in peace.

537
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:25,653
And he never appeared again.

538
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:34,329
That isn't just a story l heard.

539
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:35,914
l lived it.

540
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:10,865
Do you want to go into your aunt's house

541
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:13,785
in case you want to take anything?

542
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:15,787
No, Raimunda will come later.

543
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:19,707
Tell her it went very well
and the whole village came.

544
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:22,460
l'll do that.

545
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:25,630
l'm going to miss her so much!

546
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:31,511
Go on.

547
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:36,743
Let me out, Sole!

548
00:41:42,082 --> 00:41:44,542
Let me out! l'm your mother.

549
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:46,419
l won't do anything to you.

550
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:56,095
My mother is dead.

551
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:01,976
lf you're anything,
you're her ghost or her spirit.

552
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:04,604
Whatever you say, but get me out of here.

553
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:06,481
l'm in the trunk of your car.

554
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:11,819
Really, Mom, the things you do!

555
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:23,498
Soledad,

556
00:42:23,582 --> 00:42:25,625
daughter,

557
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:28,253
don't be afraid of me.

558
00:42:28,295 --> 00:42:29,546
l'm your mother.

559
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:33,967
Aren't you going to give me a hug?

560
00:42:46,772 --> 00:42:48,398
Now, give me a hand.

561
00:42:48,482 --> 00:42:49,649
Take this.

562
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:55,655
-Auntie's suitcase!
-Yes.

563
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:01,578
What is all this?

564
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:04,581
Clothes and some valuables Auntie had.

565
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:07,166
A good thing l hid them
before the neighbors arrived.

566
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:09,961
Except for Agustina, they all went
through everything,

567
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:12,755
but l'd got there first.

568
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:15,925
You'll have to give Agustina a gift,
she's been so good.

569
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:17,510
Better than your sister.

570
00:43:17,553 --> 00:43:20,597
There was such a fuss
when she didn't turn up.

571
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:24,017
lf you'd heard what Squinty said about her!

572
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:27,520
Thank heavens you came.

573
00:43:27,563 --> 00:43:29,564
l'm wrecked after the trip.

574
00:43:33,068 --> 00:43:37,071
-Are you sleeping here?
-Yes, where do you want me to go?

575
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:39,324
What a sight!

576
00:43:39,366 --> 00:43:41,701
l'm not surprised l scared you.

577
00:43:41,744 --> 00:43:43,828
Do you still have the illegal hair salon?

578
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:46,289
That's how l make my living.

579
00:43:46,373 --> 00:43:50,126
-ls that the guest room?
-Yes, that's it.

580
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:53,212
Tomorrow, you can give me
a color and a trim.

581
00:43:53,255 --> 00:43:55,048
And l need dark glasses, too.

582
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:57,717
l don't want to be stuck in the house all day.

583
00:43:57,801 --> 00:43:59,677
l have to go out.

584
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,471
Nobody knows me here.

585
00:44:01,555 --> 00:44:05,058
ln the village, l couldn't even go to
the front door.

586
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:07,268
l need a bit of air.

587
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:11,898
Are you staying for long?

588
00:44:12,858 --> 00:44:14,567
You want to throw me out already?

589
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:16,277
No, l'm just asking.

590
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:21,115
l'll stay for as long as God wills,
if you don't mind.

591
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:25,870
When you tire of me,
you just have to say so.

592
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:27,538
But for a separated woman,

593
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:29,832
who's better company than her mother?

594
00:44:30,584 --> 00:44:34,587
Unless you've got yourself a sweetie-pie.

595
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:36,047
No, Mom.

596
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:39,008
l'm alone, like always.

597
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:40,134
Not anymore.

598
00:44:43,055 --> 00:44:44,305
Answer the phone.

599
00:44:46,642 --> 00:44:49,102
-Are you back?
-Yes.

600
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:51,604
You were out of range, so l rang Agustina.

601
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:53,773
She said it all went very well.

602
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:55,942
The whole village came.

603
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:57,777
l've been thinking about you all day.

604
00:44:57,861 --> 00:45:00,029
l really wanted to be there.

605
00:45:00,739 --> 00:45:02,573
Hang on, Sole.

606
00:45:02,616 --> 00:45:03,658
300.

607
00:45:05,327 --> 00:45:07,620
-What do I owe for the drinks?
-Nothing.

608
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:08,788
They're on the house.

609
00:45:08,872 --> 00:45:12,125
-Well, tomorrow, same time.
-Sure.

610
00:45:12,167 --> 00:45:14,419
-The crew was very happy.
-l'm glad.

611
00:45:14,461 --> 00:45:17,130
lf you don't mind,
and even if you charge more,

612
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:19,882
could the helpings be more generous?

613
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:23,302
Tomorrow,
you'll have food coming out your eyes.

614
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:25,805
-Great, see you then.
-So long.

615
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:29,809
Sorry, Sole.

616
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:32,353
Have you got a job in a restaurant, too?

617
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:34,856
Yes, l've taken over Emilio's place.

618
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:36,149
Good Lord!

619
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:37,400
He was sick of it,

620
00:45:37,484 --> 00:45:40,361
but that's not the only news.

621
00:45:40,446 --> 00:45:41,446
Paco has left us.

622
00:45:41,488 --> 00:45:43,698
That's why I couldn't go to the funeral.

623
00:45:43,782 --> 00:45:45,742
We were having a row when you rang.

624
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:47,910
l knew something was wrong.

625
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:49,871
Did he hit you?

626
00:45:49,955 --> 00:45:52,874
Paco wasn't violent.

627
00:45:52,958 --> 00:45:54,500
He's just gone,

628
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:56,919
forever

629
00:45:57,004 --> 00:45:58,504
He'll come back, you'll see.

630
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:00,548
l doubt it.

631
00:46:00,632 --> 00:46:01,841
Why are you so sure?

632
00:46:01,884 --> 00:46:03,676
You can tell these things.

633
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:07,346
Well, so long.

634
00:46:08,348 --> 00:46:09,348
So long.

635
00:46:09,391 --> 00:46:10,850
Bye.

636
00:46:12,352 --> 00:46:15,772
None of the three of us had any luck
with men.

637
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:18,983
Raimunda and l didn't, but you...

638
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:20,401
Me, what?

639
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:22,528
Dad adored you.

640
00:46:22,571 --> 00:46:25,406
Raimunda says that you were lucky,

641
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:27,992
you died in the arms
of the person you loved most.

642
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:30,995
Your sister isn't a bad person,
but she's got a nasty streak.

643
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:33,873
l was blind about him,

644
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:37,376
and he cheated on me until the day he died!

645
00:46:38,086 --> 00:46:40,671
-What do you mean?
-lt's true.

646
00:46:40,714 --> 00:46:44,342
l kept that quiet all my life.
l never wanted you two to know.

647
00:46:44,384 --> 00:46:47,804
But let's drop it.
l don't want to talk ill of the dead.

648
00:46:48,555 --> 00:46:52,266
-ls he going to appear?
-l hope not.

649
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:54,393
And your husband?

650
00:46:54,436 --> 00:46:56,145
What about him?

651
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:58,231
Might he turn up someday?

652
00:46:58,273 --> 00:46:59,816
l doubt it.

653
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:02,276
l haven't heard from him in two years.

654
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:05,696
All the better.
lt'll just be the two of us together.

655
00:47:57,958 --> 00:48:00,167
The pork cost you 1 0?

656
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:01,627
1 0.80.

657
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:05,131
-l'll give you an extra 3 euros.
-Thanks, love.

658
00:48:05,173 --> 00:48:08,634
And l'll pay you for four boxes of cookies,
not three.

659
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:09,802
Thanks.

660
00:48:09,845 --> 00:48:11,721
l don't want you to think l'd cheat you.

661
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:17,310
Could you help me with this?
l can't move it on my own.

662
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:20,563
-Where are you taking it?
-To the restaurant.

663
00:48:20,647 --> 00:48:23,399
You're the expert in removals.
Where do we...

664
00:48:23,483 --> 00:48:26,694
Get ahold of it, tip it over,
but not all the way.

665
00:48:26,778 --> 00:48:29,989
-Otherwise, we won't get it through.
-ls this all right?

666
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:33,200
Now, straighten up, to the right,
more to the right...

667
00:48:33,285 --> 00:48:37,288
-We can't see anything.
-l'll guide you.

668
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:40,166
Careful, it'll come this way.

669
00:48:40,208 --> 00:48:41,667
All the way...

670
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:43,085
Don't rush it.

671
00:48:44,963 --> 00:48:46,213
Are we at the door?

672
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:50,176
The elevator is here.

673
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:53,471
Wait, wait. This has to go in straight.

674
00:48:53,513 --> 00:48:56,015
l'll take this end.

675
00:48:56,058 --> 00:48:57,183
You take it.

676
00:48:57,267 --> 00:48:58,559
You're doing fine.

677
00:48:58,644 --> 00:49:00,269
Good Lord! This is tough.

678
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:01,354
Careful!

679
00:49:05,859 --> 00:49:07,485
Call it from downstairs.

680
00:49:12,032 --> 00:49:14,200
l want them to see we don't use frozen food.

681
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:16,994
lt's all natural, fresh every day.

682
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:18,537
Over to the corner.

683
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:21,123
-And the other freezer?
-lt's broken.

684
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:23,376
So you're taking over the restaurant?

685
00:49:23,418 --> 00:49:27,171
Yes, at least until the crew finishes the film.

686
00:49:27,214 --> 00:49:28,714
Then l'll see.

687
00:49:28,757 --> 00:49:32,093
You can count on me.
l make great desserts.

688
00:49:32,177 --> 00:49:35,012
And l can serve drinks at night.

689
00:49:35,055 --> 00:49:38,557
l don't know if we'll work nights,
but l'm counting on you.

690
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:40,559
-Sure.
-And thanks.

691
00:49:44,022 --> 00:49:45,231
Mom...

692
00:49:48,902 --> 00:49:51,988
ls there anything you want me to do?

693
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:53,572
Cut my hair.

694
00:49:54,741 --> 00:49:56,993
l mean,

695
00:49:57,077 --> 00:49:59,120
is there anything

696
00:49:59,204 --> 00:50:01,163
you left undone in life

697
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:04,709
that won't let you rest in peace?

698
00:50:04,751 --> 00:50:07,962
People always leave things undone,

699
00:50:08,046 --> 00:50:10,464
or done badly,

700
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:13,509
and l'm no exception.

701
00:50:13,593 --> 00:50:16,262
But l don't know if they can be fixed.

702
00:50:16,346 --> 00:50:18,014
And if they can,

703
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:19,932
it's up to me to fix them.

704
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:26,272
My clients will be arriving soon.
What'll we do?

705
00:50:26,314 --> 00:50:29,233
Look after them. l'll help you.

706
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:31,277
But l can't say you're my mother.

707
00:50:31,319 --> 00:50:33,362
They know l'm an orphan.

708
00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:35,322
l'll say l'm a foreigner.

709
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:38,868
A foreigner? From where?

710
00:50:38,952 --> 00:50:39,952
Dominican Republic?

711
00:50:40,037 --> 00:50:42,163
No, there are lots around here,

712
00:50:42,247 --> 00:50:44,165
they'd notice your accent.

713
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:47,418
Chinese?

714
00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:49,253
Madrid's full of Chinese.

715
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:52,339
Who'd believe you're Chinese?

716
00:50:52,424 --> 00:50:55,634
Something we don't have around here.

717
00:50:55,677 --> 00:50:56,761
Russian!

718
00:51:00,348 --> 00:51:02,516
Do l really look more Russian than Chinese?

719
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:06,187
Yes, the Russians are like us.

720
00:51:06,271 --> 00:51:10,232
Look, whatever you hear,
keep your mouth shut.

721
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:13,694
And don't let them see
that you understand us.

722
00:51:13,779 --> 00:51:15,571
l'll show you how everything works.

723
00:51:15,655 --> 00:51:17,698
ln the bedroom, l cut, dry, and color,

724
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:19,575
and here l wash their hair.

725
00:51:20,869 --> 00:51:23,454
lf the client is tall, lift this up.

726
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:25,664
lf she's small, put it down.

727
00:51:25,707 --> 00:51:29,168
This towel is to keep you from slipping.

728
00:51:29,211 --> 00:51:30,503
And l keep this here

729
00:51:30,545 --> 00:51:33,005
because up above it's very uncomfortable,

730
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:34,381
and if it's down there,

731
00:51:34,466 --> 00:51:37,510
l have to bend down so often
l wreck my back.

732
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:40,304
l get a lot of backaches, too.

733
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:42,223
And the shampoo is measured out.

734
00:51:42,307 --> 00:51:43,682
Sit down.

735
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:50,689
-Are you all right?
-Yes.

736
00:51:50,732 --> 00:51:53,609
Just one towel
or the client will feel suffocated.

737
00:51:53,693 --> 00:51:55,820
l'm the same.

738
00:51:55,862 --> 00:51:58,364
And then, with that same towel,

739
00:51:58,406 --> 00:52:01,826
you dry her hair a bit so it doesn't
drip down her back.

740
00:52:01,868 --> 00:52:04,995
lt's all so well organized.
You're very smart, love.

741
00:52:11,253 --> 00:52:12,962
Hello.

742
00:52:17,884 --> 00:52:19,969
She doesn't speak Spanish, she's Russian.

743
00:52:20,053 --> 00:52:21,804
They're in a terrible state.

744
00:52:21,888 --> 00:52:23,722
l took her in out of charity.

745
00:52:23,765 --> 00:52:26,851
When l saw her begging in the street,
she reminded me of my mother.

746
00:52:26,893 --> 00:52:28,727
Don't trust all the old women you see.

747
00:52:28,770 --> 00:52:31,063
Especially Russians.
There are lots of mafias.

748
00:52:31,148 --> 00:52:33,065
People take advantage of you.

749
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:35,776
Are you getting streaks? Sit down here.

750
00:52:36,945 --> 00:52:39,405
-Wash hair.
-Yes.

751
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:41,073
She was a hairdresser in Russia.

752
00:52:41,158 --> 00:52:42,658
How do you communicate?

753
00:52:42,742 --> 00:52:45,578
With signs. She understands everything.
She's sharp.

754
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:47,413
She'll speak Spanish in no time.

755
00:52:47,497 --> 00:52:51,083
Yes, look at all the top models
who are Russian.

756
00:52:51,126 --> 00:52:52,168
Heavens!

757
00:52:56,673 --> 00:52:59,508
-So, Russian?
-Russia.

758
00:53:06,099 --> 00:53:07,641
The water,

759
00:53:07,726 --> 00:53:08,893
not hot,

760
00:53:08,935 --> 00:53:10,477
not cold.

761
00:53:12,147 --> 00:53:13,522
Very good.

762
00:53:29,706 --> 00:53:31,624
Hello.

763
00:53:31,666 --> 00:53:33,042
Hey there.

764
00:53:33,126 --> 00:53:35,461
We have a day off tomorrow.

765
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:39,506
Then we'll have one, too.
We need a break.

766
00:53:39,591 --> 00:53:42,051
And we finish up next week.

767
00:53:42,135 --> 00:53:44,345
We wanted to have the wrap party here.

768
00:53:44,429 --> 00:53:45,971
Great.

769
00:53:46,014 --> 00:53:49,808
Do you want a sit-down meal or a buffet?

770
00:53:49,851 --> 00:53:52,186
A buffet would be great.

771
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:55,231
And we'd like to have the terrace just for us.

772
00:53:55,315 --> 00:53:57,775
That's no problem.

773
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:03,906
Don't look at me like that,
you make me nervous.

774
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:05,824
Same here.

775
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:08,619
Go and have a drink, l'm working.

776
00:54:08,662 --> 00:54:10,329
All right.

777
00:54:12,290 --> 00:54:15,292
She's been strange since she came back
from the village.

778
00:54:15,335 --> 00:54:17,878
lf she asks you about Paco,
you know nothing.

779
00:54:17,963 --> 00:54:19,505
And it's true.

780
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:21,340
The less you know, the better.

781
00:54:21,383 --> 00:54:24,343
And above all don't keep thinking about it.

782
00:54:37,857 --> 00:54:39,108
Hello.

783
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:43,112
-Are you with someone?
-No.

784
00:54:43,196 --> 00:54:46,365
-l'm going to the bathroom.
-What for?

785
00:54:46,408 --> 00:54:47,783
l'm dying to piss.

786
00:54:48,576 --> 00:54:51,161
lt's broken.
l'm waiting for the plumber.

787
00:54:51,204 --> 00:54:54,373
l'll throw some water down,
for Christ's sake! l have to piss.

788
00:54:57,335 --> 00:54:58,544
Hello!

789
00:55:00,714 --> 00:55:02,881
What's wrong with you?

790
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:05,676
-l'm at a difficult age.
-You're not the only one.

791
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:08,679
-l'm going to trim your hair.
-No, l know you.

792
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:11,765
-Just the ends.
-Less than a centimeter.

793
00:55:18,898 --> 00:55:20,899
Tell me,

794
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:22,693
has your Dad not come back?

795
00:55:22,736 --> 00:55:24,236
No.

796
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:26,113
He said goodbye for good.

797
00:55:26,906 --> 00:55:30,409
That's incredible.
l just don't understand.

798
00:55:33,788 --> 00:55:35,539
lt smells of farts!

799
00:55:41,504 --> 00:55:43,380
What's your mother up to?

800
00:55:43,423 --> 00:55:44,423
What?

801
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:47,926
She's such a pain!
Ever since she was a child.

802
00:55:47,969 --> 00:55:51,180
And in those days we didn't have
a bathroom.

803
00:55:51,264 --> 00:55:53,432
We did it in the yard.

804
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:55,559
We'd be waiting for her all day.

805
00:55:55,602 --> 00:55:58,687
All day long she'd be in the yard,
with the hens.

806
00:55:59,981 --> 00:56:01,273
Raimunda!

807
00:56:36,142 --> 00:56:38,435
This dressing gown...

808
00:56:38,478 --> 00:56:40,229
lt's Mom's.

809
00:56:40,313 --> 00:56:41,939
l know that.

810
00:56:43,733 --> 00:56:45,150
And the smell?

811
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:48,112
What smell?

812
00:56:48,154 --> 00:56:50,697
ln the bathroom and here.

813
00:56:50,782 --> 00:56:53,826
lt's as if Mom had just been here,
farting her ass off!

814
00:56:53,868 --> 00:56:55,327
Don't you smell it?

815
00:57:00,291 --> 00:57:01,917
The way she used to fart!

816
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:07,673
And she could never hide it
because she was the first to laugh!

817
00:57:11,553 --> 00:57:14,138
lt's as if l can hear her now.

818
00:57:16,182 --> 00:57:17,766
Don't be silly!

819
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:27,693
Why did you bring these clothes?

820
00:57:27,735 --> 00:57:30,154
No wonder you have nightmares.

821
00:57:30,196 --> 00:57:32,448
You give away dead people's clothes.

822
00:57:37,537 --> 00:57:39,788
Aunt Paula's suitcase!

823
00:57:55,388 --> 00:57:57,556
The antique dolls!

824
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:08,442
Herjewel case!

825
00:58:11,571 --> 00:58:13,363
What were you going to do with this?

826
00:58:14,782 --> 00:58:15,991
Nothing.

827
00:58:16,075 --> 00:58:18,160
You were going to keep it.

828
00:58:18,244 --> 00:58:19,495
Really, Sole.

829
00:58:19,579 --> 00:58:21,914
Don't get the wrong idea.

830
00:58:21,956 --> 00:58:23,582
l didn't bring the case.

831
00:58:24,876 --> 00:58:26,335
Then why is it here?

832
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:31,590
When l got to Aunt Paula's house...

833
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:33,926
What?

834
00:58:36,221 --> 00:58:38,388
l'd never have believed this.

835
00:58:39,474 --> 00:58:43,936
Stealing the few things she had
before she was even in the grave.

836
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:45,687
What a nerve!

837
00:58:48,858 --> 00:58:50,817
Don't go off like that!

838
00:59:22,892 --> 00:59:25,352
We have to buy another fridge.

839
00:59:26,437 --> 00:59:28,814
Why not fix the one in the storeroom?

840
00:59:30,149 --> 00:59:31,191
lt doesn't work.

841
00:59:33,486 --> 00:59:35,779
The motor's making a noise.

842
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:39,074
l said no one is to go in there,
including you.

843
00:59:39,158 --> 00:59:42,578
The door was open, l went in for a hammer.

844
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:44,496
Has anyone else been in?

845
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:46,498
l don't think so.

846
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:54,840
You said you'd got rid of him.

847
00:59:54,882 --> 00:59:57,009
l wasn't able to.

848
00:59:57,510 --> 00:59:59,845
You think l like having him in there?

849
01:00:04,183 --> 01:00:08,478
Get dressed, everyone will be arriving soon.

850
01:00:17,530 --> 01:00:20,324
Why are you still like that?

851
01:00:20,366 --> 01:00:24,411
-l'm not in a party mood.
-Neither am l, but it's work.

852
01:00:25,496 --> 01:00:27,164
Don't be such a lazybones.

853
01:00:27,206 --> 01:00:30,208
Come on, pet, l'll help you.

854
01:00:31,919 --> 01:00:33,420
What's wrong?

855
01:00:33,504 --> 01:00:38,925
l can't forget about it when he's so near,
in the storeroom.

856
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:42,387
That's the best way to go crazy,
and to drive me crazy, too.

857
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:45,349
You don't know what it's like to have
killed your father.

858
01:00:46,851 --> 01:00:49,061
Paco wasn't your father.

859
01:00:49,145 --> 01:00:51,521
Don't lie to me anymore.

860
01:00:51,564 --> 01:00:55,609
l know you're doing it for me,
but please don't lie.

861
01:00:55,693 --> 01:00:57,736
l'm not lying.

862
01:00:57,820 --> 01:00:59,821
He recognized you as his daughter,

863
01:00:59,906 --> 01:01:02,407
but he knew he wasn't
your biological father.

864
01:01:07,664 --> 01:01:09,748
So was he telling me the truth?

865
01:01:09,791 --> 01:01:10,791
Yes.

866
01:01:11,542 --> 01:01:13,418
But that doesn't justify what he did.

867
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:21,593
l promise l'll tell you everything
another time.

868
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:25,138
What's the point of sitting here?

869
01:01:25,556 --> 01:01:27,307
Who was my father?

870
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:30,268
A guy in the village.

871
01:01:30,311 --> 01:01:31,978
Do l know him?

872
01:01:33,106 --> 01:01:34,773
He's dead.

873
01:01:36,818 --> 01:01:39,611
l'll tell you everything.

874
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:40,779
l swear.

875
01:01:40,863 --> 01:01:43,448
l'll hold you to your word.

876
01:01:54,752 --> 01:01:57,838
-Two mojitos!
-Coming up!

877
01:01:57,922 --> 01:02:00,966
What about you, love? Another two?

878
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:04,386
With lemon. lt's perfect.

879
01:02:10,435 --> 01:02:12,269
We need more glasses.

880
01:02:12,311 --> 01:02:14,146
l can hardly keep up.

881
01:02:14,188 --> 01:02:16,064
lsn't Paula looking pretty?

882
01:02:20,987 --> 01:02:22,362
Here.

883
01:02:23,114 --> 01:02:24,114
Thanks.

884
01:02:27,326 --> 01:02:28,744
How delicious!

885
01:02:28,828 --> 01:02:31,204
l can't take any more.
They're really good.

886
01:02:31,289 --> 01:02:34,499
With your cleavage and my mojitos,
we'd make a fortune.

887
01:02:34,542 --> 01:02:38,462
We should start working nights
and try to liven up

888
01:02:38,504 --> 01:02:40,172
this lousy neighborhood.

889
01:02:40,256 --> 01:02:43,383
We'll talk about that.
First, we have to keep this lot happy.

890
01:02:43,468 --> 01:02:44,968
Have a mojito!

891
01:02:45,928 --> 01:02:47,512
Keep down, they mustn't see you!

892
01:02:47,555 --> 01:02:50,599
l'd like to see Raimunda and Paula.

893
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:53,769
The other day, l only saw their feet.

894
01:02:53,853 --> 01:02:55,479
And look at the fuss you caused!

895
01:02:56,814 --> 01:02:58,356
ls that the restaurant?

896
01:03:00,359 --> 01:03:03,695
She said it was going well,
but l never imagined this!

897
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:05,864
She deserves it.

898
01:03:05,907 --> 01:03:07,991
She's had a hard time.

899
01:03:17,251 --> 01:03:19,753
Stay in the car and don't let anyone see you.

900
01:03:19,837 --> 01:03:21,546
No one can see me here!

901
01:03:53,246 --> 01:03:54,579
What are you doing here?

902
01:03:55,331 --> 01:03:56,581
This is great!

903
01:03:56,666 --> 01:04:00,669
l've brought you Aunt Paula's things.
l didn't know about the party.

904
01:04:00,753 --> 01:04:03,505
lt's a film crew celebrating
the end of the shoot.

905
01:04:03,589 --> 01:04:05,674
l've been catering for them.

906
01:04:05,758 --> 01:04:07,759
Let's put the suitcase away.

907
01:04:07,802 --> 01:04:09,678
Why did you bother?

908
01:04:09,762 --> 01:04:12,264
l'd never have kept anything ofAuntie's,

909
01:04:12,348 --> 01:04:13,974
much less hidden it from you.

910
01:04:14,058 --> 01:04:16,101
l know that. l'm sorry for what l said.

911
01:04:16,185 --> 01:04:18,603
l always shoot my mouth off.

912
01:04:18,688 --> 01:04:19,855
Hello, Auntie.

913
01:04:21,607 --> 01:04:23,775
-You want anything?
-No.

914
01:04:44,505 --> 01:04:48,884
I can see the twinkling of the lights
in the distance

915
01:04:48,968 --> 01:04:51,803
That are marking my return

916
01:04:52,471 --> 01:04:53,722
Remember?

917
01:04:54,348 --> 01:04:56,516
How could l forget?

918
01:04:56,601 --> 01:04:59,144
lt's so long since l heard you sing!

919
01:04:59,186 --> 01:05:01,563
l've never heard her sing.

920
01:05:04,025 --> 01:05:05,066
Really?

921
01:05:05,151 --> 01:05:06,943
Really, never.

922
01:05:08,738 --> 01:05:12,574
-Would you like to?
-What do you think? Of course!

923
01:05:18,331 --> 01:05:19,331
Come on!

924
01:05:23,419 --> 01:05:25,128
l can't believe it.

925
01:05:35,181 --> 01:05:37,390
Sit there.

926
01:05:43,731 --> 01:05:44,773
Be quiet!

927
01:05:44,857 --> 01:05:47,233
Sit down! This woman's going to sing!

928
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:53,323
Good evening.

929
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:56,284
l'd like to thank the crew

930
01:05:56,369 --> 01:05:58,870
for the work you've given us
these past weeks.

931
01:05:58,955 --> 01:06:01,581
Thank you so much.

932
01:06:01,666 --> 01:06:04,751
l haven't sung for a very long time,

933
01:06:04,835 --> 01:06:07,128
but l'll do it tonight and see how it goes.

934
01:06:21,352 --> 01:06:26,272
I'm afraid of the encounter

935
01:06:26,357 --> 01:06:30,110
With the past that's coming back

936
01:06:30,194 --> 01:06:33,071
To confront my life

937
01:06:33,155 --> 01:06:35,573
Your grandma taught her that song

938
01:06:35,658 --> 01:06:38,243
for the audition for child singers.

939
01:06:38,285 --> 01:06:42,372
I'm afraid of the nights

940
01:06:42,415 --> 01:06:46,251
That, filled with memories

941
01:06:46,293 --> 01:06:49,379
Enchain my dreams

942
01:06:49,422 --> 01:06:51,673
But the fleeing traveler

943
01:06:51,757 --> 01:06:55,468
Sooner or Iater must come to a haIt

944
01:06:55,553 --> 01:06:59,180
And even though oblivion
Which destroys everything

945
01:06:59,265 --> 01:07:02,600
Has killed my old illusions

946
01:07:02,643 --> 01:07:05,437
I still retain a humble hope hidden away

947
01:07:05,479 --> 01:07:10,108
And that is all of my heart's fortune

948
01:07:10,192 --> 01:07:15,113
Coming back

949
01:07:17,575 --> 01:07:19,784
With a wrinkIed forehead

950
01:07:19,869 --> 01:07:22,245
And the snows of time

951
01:07:22,288 --> 01:07:24,205
SiIvering my brow

952
01:07:24,290 --> 01:07:28,001
Feeling

953
01:07:28,085 --> 01:07:31,546
That Iife is an instant

954
01:07:31,630 --> 01:07:33,840
That 20 years is nothing

955
01:07:33,924 --> 01:07:35,425
That the feverish eyes

956
01:07:35,468 --> 01:07:38,887
Wandering in the shadows
Seek you and name you

957
01:07:38,971 --> 01:07:42,182
Living

958
01:07:42,266 --> 01:07:44,476
With my soul clinging

959
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:46,352
To a sweet memory

960
01:07:46,437 --> 01:07:49,647
That I weep for again

961
01:08:25,226 --> 01:08:26,810
Autos Amigos.

962
01:08:26,852 --> 01:08:30,480
Good morning.
l'm calling because l saw your ad.

963
01:08:30,523 --> 01:08:33,483
l need to rent a van.

964
01:08:33,526 --> 01:08:35,944
What kind, and for how long?

965
01:08:36,028 --> 01:08:39,489
The cheapest one you have.
lt's just for one day.

966
01:08:43,661 --> 01:08:45,787
Yes?

967
01:08:45,871 --> 01:08:48,206
CouId I speak to Miss Raimunda?

968
01:08:48,290 --> 01:08:49,499
Speaking.

969
01:08:49,542 --> 01:08:53,044
Emilio gave me your number so you could
show me the restaurant.

970
01:08:53,129 --> 01:08:56,381
I'm very keen to see it.
My name is CarIos.

971
01:08:57,883 --> 01:09:00,009
Well,

972
01:09:00,052 --> 01:09:02,470
you should have called earlier

973
01:09:02,555 --> 01:09:05,265
because a neighbor has taken it over.

974
01:09:05,349 --> 01:09:08,226
EmiIio didn't teII me that.

975
01:09:08,269 --> 01:09:11,396
That's his strategy, just in case.

976
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:14,732
CouId I speak to the person
who's taken it over?

977
01:09:14,775 --> 01:09:17,110
This is her day off, l'm sorry.

978
01:09:17,194 --> 01:09:21,156
lf you call Emilio l'm sure he'll
explain everything.

979
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:23,241
Thank you.

980
01:09:23,284 --> 01:09:25,410
Goodbye.

981
01:09:36,505 --> 01:09:39,924
-HeIIo?
-Emilio? lt's Raimunda.

982
01:09:40,009 --> 01:09:43,178
It's great to hear you.
Did a man go to see the restaurant?

983
01:09:43,262 --> 01:09:46,931
Yes, but l didn't trust him.
l think he wanted it as a front.

984
01:09:47,016 --> 01:09:48,600
For what?

985
01:09:48,684 --> 01:09:52,228
For drugs, or to open a brothel.
l don't know.

986
01:09:52,271 --> 01:09:55,732
When l said it wasn't doing well
he said that was even better, so...

987
01:09:55,774 --> 01:09:59,110
Why on earth did you say that?

988
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:03,531
l've been meaning to call you for days.

989
01:10:03,616 --> 01:10:05,450
l hope you understand.

990
01:10:05,492 --> 01:10:07,535
l know it's not the way to do things,

991
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:12,290
but l've taken over the restaurant.

992
01:10:12,374 --> 01:10:15,752
You? What do you mean?

993
01:10:15,794 --> 01:10:18,296
l can explain it all to you.

994
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:21,299
You were out of line, way out of line.

995
01:10:22,384 --> 01:10:25,220
You abused my trust.

996
01:10:25,304 --> 01:10:26,554
lt's no excuse,

997
01:10:26,639 --> 01:10:29,891
but when the film crew appeared,
l was desperate.

998
01:10:29,975 --> 01:10:32,810
And now that Paco's left us,
you can imagine...

999
01:10:32,895 --> 01:10:34,479
What? Paco's left you?

1000
01:10:34,521 --> 01:10:37,774
Yes. We had a huge fight.

1001
01:10:37,816 --> 01:10:40,485
He's gone, and l don't think he'll be back.

1002
01:10:40,569 --> 01:10:43,529
He left the same day you went to Barcelona.

1003
01:10:43,614 --> 01:10:45,490
How are you coping?

1004
01:10:45,574 --> 01:10:48,451
Me? l'm hysterical.

1005
01:10:48,494 --> 01:10:50,370
Clutching at straws.

1006
01:10:50,454 --> 01:10:53,998
Well, we'll try to sort it out.

1007
01:10:54,917 --> 01:10:58,169
Tell me what l owe for the month,
and l'll send it to you,

1008
01:10:58,212 --> 01:11:00,546
but give me a few days.

1009
01:11:20,734 --> 01:11:22,986
-Hello?
-Raimunda?

1010
01:11:23,028 --> 01:11:24,362
Yes, who's that?

1011
01:11:24,405 --> 01:11:28,032
It's Agustina.
I'm in Madrid and I'd like to see you.

1012
01:11:29,618 --> 01:11:32,829
lt's difficult, l'm really busy today.

1013
01:11:32,871 --> 01:11:33,913
Tomorrow?

1014
01:11:33,998 --> 01:11:36,708
No, the whole week is a real mess.

1015
01:11:36,792 --> 01:11:40,211
Don't say that. I'm in the hospital.

1016
01:11:40,254 --> 01:11:41,462
What's wrong?

1017
01:11:41,547 --> 01:11:45,216
I've got cancer.
The doctors told me yesterday.

1018
01:11:45,301 --> 01:11:47,927
I need to see you.

1019
01:11:48,012 --> 01:11:50,638
Tell me what hospital you're in,
l'll come today.

1020
01:11:50,723 --> 01:11:53,057
I'm in CentraI HospitaI.

1021
01:11:53,142 --> 01:11:55,810
God bIess you.

1022
01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:04,902
You go up, l'm in a hurry.
Give this to your aunt.

1023
01:12:12,077 --> 01:12:14,662
-Hello, Auntie.
-What are you doing here?

1024
01:12:18,083 --> 01:12:19,751
ls that your mother shouting?

1025
01:12:19,835 --> 01:12:22,295
Come to the window!

1026
01:12:24,590 --> 01:12:25,715
What?

1027
01:12:25,758 --> 01:12:27,258
l'm leaving Paula with you.

1028
01:12:27,301 --> 01:12:29,093
But l'm working.

1029
01:12:29,178 --> 01:12:32,889
l have to go to the hospital to see Agustina.
She's got cancer.

1030
01:12:32,931 --> 01:12:35,058
What a pity, the poor thing.

1031
01:12:35,100 --> 01:12:38,728
Paula is bringing up Auntie's case.
Keep it.

1032
01:12:38,771 --> 01:12:42,106
l've got to do a few things,
and then l'll come back.

1033
01:12:42,191 --> 01:12:43,775
Give my regards to Agustina.

1034
01:12:43,859 --> 01:12:47,612
-Tell her you saw me!
-Yes, nuisance.

1035
01:12:50,574 --> 01:12:51,991
Can l come in now?

1036
01:12:53,869 --> 01:12:55,119
Yes, love.

1037
01:13:16,141 --> 01:13:17,683
How are you?

1038
01:13:20,813 --> 01:13:23,856
They opened then closed me up again.

1039
01:13:23,941 --> 01:13:27,985
-l knew l had something nasty.
-Don't give up hope.

1040
01:13:29,154 --> 01:13:31,531
The flowers are lovely!

1041
01:13:31,615 --> 01:13:35,618
You shouldn't have bothered.
Leave them there.

1042
01:13:41,333 --> 01:13:44,001
l have to ask you a favor.

1043
01:13:44,044 --> 01:13:47,004
Whatever you want.

1044
01:13:47,089 --> 01:13:48,923
Close the door.

1045
01:13:52,845 --> 01:13:54,178
Get a chair.

1046
01:14:04,982 --> 01:14:08,401
l won't last very long,

1047
01:14:08,485 --> 01:14:11,696
but l don't want to die without knowing
what happened to my mother.

1048
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:14,949
But what can l do?

1049
01:14:16,034 --> 01:14:19,704
You can tell me if she's alive or dead.

1050
01:14:20,706 --> 01:14:22,457
How will l know?

1051
01:14:22,541 --> 01:14:24,459
Ask your mother.

1052
01:14:25,878 --> 01:14:28,921
My mother? She's dead!

1053
01:14:29,006 --> 01:14:32,550
But she appeared to your Aunt Paula

1054
01:14:32,634 --> 01:14:34,343
and looked after her until she died.

1055
01:14:34,386 --> 01:14:36,220
The whole village knows that.

1056
01:14:36,263 --> 01:14:41,100
lf she should appear to you,
ask her about my mother.

1057
01:14:41,185 --> 01:14:43,227
That's all l'm asking.

1058
01:14:43,270 --> 01:14:45,980
What you're asking me is crazy.

1059
01:14:46,064 --> 01:14:48,566
Did you ever see her with your own eyes?

1060
01:14:48,609 --> 01:14:50,276
No.

1061
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:52,487
And you live across the street.

1062
01:14:52,571 --> 01:14:55,406
l think she hid from me.

1063
01:14:55,449 --> 01:14:59,035
But l heard your aunt talking to her
a thousand times.

1064
01:15:00,746 --> 01:15:04,749
lf l hear anything, l'll tell you.

1065
01:15:05,751 --> 01:15:08,503
But l think it's unlikely.

1066
01:15:11,298 --> 01:15:13,382
You owe me this.

1067
01:15:14,468 --> 01:15:15,843
lt's all l'm asking.

1068
01:15:15,928 --> 01:15:18,930
l have to go, l've got lots to do.

1069
01:15:18,972 --> 01:15:22,475
Wait, my sister wants to see you.
She'll be here any minute.

1070
01:15:22,559 --> 01:15:25,061
Some other day, l'm in a real hurry.

1071
01:15:25,103 --> 01:15:28,231
She wants you to go on TV.

1072
01:15:28,273 --> 01:15:31,692
You know she works on Wherever You Are.

1073
01:15:31,777 --> 01:15:34,362
They want to surprise her,
and they thought of you.

1074
01:15:34,446 --> 01:15:38,699
You were friends as children,
and you both went to an audition.

1075
01:15:38,784 --> 01:15:41,410
That's enough for several shows,

1076
01:15:41,453 --> 01:15:43,913
with interviews, music and songs

1077
01:15:43,956 --> 01:15:47,291
from yesterday, from today and for all times.

1078
01:15:47,376 --> 01:15:50,586
Tell her l don't like television.

1079
01:15:50,629 --> 01:15:54,006
Neither do l.
l'll tell her, but don't forget what l said.

1080
01:15:54,091 --> 01:15:56,133
l won't.

1081
01:15:58,136 --> 01:16:01,472
The Russian loves TV.

1082
01:16:01,557 --> 01:16:05,059
l don't know if she understands,
but she's hypnotized.

1083
01:16:05,143 --> 01:16:07,979
There's something about trash TV.

1084
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:11,190
Once l start watching it, l can't stop.

1085
01:16:11,275 --> 01:16:15,152
l feel worse and worse, but l'm hooked.

1086
01:16:15,237 --> 01:16:16,529
lt's like a drug.

1087
01:16:16,613 --> 01:16:19,031
l had to stop watching it at night.

1088
01:16:19,116 --> 01:16:21,158
l couldn't sleep afterwards.

1089
01:16:21,201 --> 01:16:23,703
All that shouting drives you crazy.

1090
01:16:25,872 --> 01:16:27,665
Do you like dolls?

1091
01:16:27,708 --> 01:16:31,043
l like these, they look like they're
from a horror movie.

1092
01:16:31,128 --> 01:16:33,254
They're very old.

1093
01:16:33,338 --> 01:16:36,632
Your mom played with them when she was
pregnant with you.

1094
01:16:36,675 --> 01:16:38,718
Why didn't mom live with you?

1095
01:16:38,802 --> 01:16:42,555
We were very short on money.

1096
01:16:42,639 --> 01:16:45,016
Your granddad went to work in Venezuela,

1097
01:16:45,058 --> 01:16:47,143
l kept Sole,

1098
01:16:47,185 --> 01:16:49,895
and your mother went to live
with Aunt Paula.

1099
01:16:51,398 --> 01:16:52,732
What has she told you?

1100
01:16:52,816 --> 01:16:55,109
Nothing, she doesn't like talking about
that time.

1101
01:16:56,194 --> 01:16:57,695
Do you get along well?

1102
01:16:57,779 --> 01:17:00,031
lt's better now,

1103
01:17:00,115 --> 01:17:02,241
but at times she's really stroppy,
Grandma.

1104
01:17:02,326 --> 01:17:03,701
She's got a temper.

1105
01:17:03,744 --> 01:17:05,578
How did you get along with her?

1106
01:17:05,662 --> 01:17:09,957
When she was little,
she was the apple of my eye,

1107
01:17:10,042 --> 01:17:13,336
but as a teenager,

1108
01:17:13,378 --> 01:17:16,130
for some reason l didn't know,

1109
01:17:17,049 --> 01:17:19,216
she grew away from me

1110
01:17:20,177 --> 01:17:22,803
until l lost her completely.

1111
01:17:24,222 --> 01:17:26,182
Your mother didn't love me.

1112
01:17:28,101 --> 01:17:32,438
lt really hurts when a daughter doesn't
love her mother.

1113
01:17:34,066 --> 01:17:36,150
That's why,

1114
01:17:36,234 --> 01:17:38,277
now that it's just the two of you,

1115
01:17:38,362 --> 01:17:40,571
you have to love her very much,

1116
01:17:40,614 --> 01:17:43,407
and she has to feel that.

1117
01:17:43,450 --> 01:17:45,242
Why have you come back?

1118
01:17:47,788 --> 01:17:50,081
Because l was very lonely.

1119
01:17:54,127 --> 01:17:55,169
Good afternoon.

1120
01:17:55,253 --> 01:17:56,962
Hello.

1121
01:17:57,047 --> 01:18:00,007
l need eight meters of plastic clothesline

1122
01:18:00,092 --> 01:18:02,009
and some packing tape.

1123
01:18:02,094 --> 01:18:03,094
How much tape?

1124
01:18:03,178 --> 01:18:04,679
Four or five rolls.

1125
01:18:04,763 --> 01:18:06,847
Very well.

1126
01:18:06,932 --> 01:18:08,933
Five rolls.

1127
01:18:11,561 --> 01:18:13,979
One...

1128
01:18:14,064 --> 01:18:15,189
Two...

1129
01:18:15,273 --> 01:18:18,067
And a pick and a shovel.

1130
01:18:18,110 --> 01:18:19,610
Very well.

1131
01:18:55,063 --> 01:18:57,648
-Great!
-Bye!

1132
01:18:59,985 --> 01:19:01,861
How are you, Raimunda?

1133
01:19:01,945 --> 01:19:02,945
Fed up.

1134
01:19:02,988 --> 01:19:04,864
How's Agustina?

1135
01:19:04,948 --> 01:19:05,990
Mad as a hatter.

1136
01:19:06,032 --> 01:19:07,158
Hi, Mom!

1137
01:19:08,285 --> 01:19:11,328
-What's up with you?
-Nothing.

1138
01:19:11,413 --> 01:19:13,956
Fetch me a glass of water, love.

1139
01:19:13,999 --> 01:19:16,584
Do you mind if she stays here tonight?

1140
01:19:16,668 --> 01:19:19,295
No, but where will she sleep?

1141
01:19:19,337 --> 01:19:21,338
ln the spare room.

1142
01:19:22,883 --> 01:19:25,676
Paco's coming over tonight.
He wants to talk.

1143
01:19:25,719 --> 01:19:27,762
l'd like us to be alone.

1144
01:19:28,722 --> 01:19:30,014
All right.

1145
01:19:31,558 --> 01:19:33,517
You're sleeping here tonight.

1146
01:19:38,690 --> 01:19:42,735
l'm off.
l've got a long night ahead of me.

1147
01:20:13,308 --> 01:20:14,350
Hello.

1148
01:20:15,894 --> 01:20:17,728
l need a favor tonight.

1149
01:20:17,813 --> 01:20:20,064
Tonight? Can't it wait until tomorrow?

1150
01:20:20,106 --> 01:20:23,275
No, but l'll pay you, like any client.

1151
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:25,736
No, love, for you a discount,

1152
01:20:25,821 --> 01:20:29,240
but l didn't know you liked pussy.

1153
01:20:29,324 --> 01:20:30,366
l don't.

1154
01:20:30,408 --> 01:20:35,079
So if you don't want to go muff-diving,
what do you want?

1155
01:20:35,121 --> 01:20:36,622
l'll explain on the way.

1156
01:20:36,706 --> 01:20:38,958
First, we have to put the freezer in the van...

1157
01:20:39,042 --> 01:20:41,210
-What?
-And take it to a dung heap.

1158
01:20:41,253 --> 01:20:43,671
We can't carry that on our own!

1159
01:20:43,755 --> 01:20:45,798
We'll ask the neighbors to help us.

1160
01:20:45,882 --> 01:20:48,092
Put on something comfortable.

1161
01:20:48,385 --> 01:20:49,802
Like what?

1162
01:20:49,886 --> 01:20:51,595
You look like you're going to explode
in that.

1163
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:52,930
-Wait! Wait!
-Like this!

1164
01:20:52,973 --> 01:20:54,139
lt sticks out here.

1165
01:20:55,267 --> 01:20:56,934
Get it on the sidewalk.

1166
01:20:56,977 --> 01:21:01,272
-lt's slipping!
-No, it's not.

1167
01:21:05,861 --> 01:21:08,821
Get it parallel to that.

1168
01:21:08,905 --> 01:21:12,241
Now, up! One, two, three!

1169
01:21:14,786 --> 01:21:18,122
Come on! One, two, three!

1170
01:21:18,164 --> 01:21:19,164
Push!

1171
01:21:21,293 --> 01:21:23,002
lt's in.

1172
01:21:23,086 --> 01:21:25,796
Bloody hell.

1173
01:21:26,172 --> 01:21:28,215
Did you hurt yourself?

1174
01:21:28,508 --> 01:21:30,467
Who needs a spleen, anyway?

1175
01:21:33,179 --> 01:21:34,847
Where are we going?

1176
01:21:35,849 --> 01:21:37,975
To the Jucar River.

1177
01:21:38,059 --> 01:21:39,602
Where's that?

1178
01:21:39,644 --> 01:21:41,812
1 80 kilometers away.

1179
01:21:41,897 --> 01:21:43,314
1 80 kilometers!

1180
01:21:43,356 --> 01:21:46,066
lt'll take us all night
just to go and come back.

1181
01:21:46,151 --> 01:21:47,776
l said l'd pay by the hour.

1182
01:21:47,819 --> 01:21:49,653
Just to go with you?

1183
01:21:49,738 --> 01:21:52,823
To come with me to the river, dig a hole,

1184
01:21:52,908 --> 01:21:55,200
bury the freezer, and not ask questions.

1185
01:21:55,285 --> 01:21:57,912
Look, l appreciate your trust,

1186
01:21:57,996 --> 01:22:01,123
but my life's complicated enough!

1187
01:22:01,166 --> 01:22:04,752
l have no job, no papers,
l have to work the streets to survive.

1188
01:22:04,836 --> 01:22:06,670
Christ, you could have asked me!

1189
01:22:06,755 --> 01:22:09,256
l'm asking you now. How much?

1190
01:22:09,341 --> 01:22:10,883
You should've asked first.

1191
01:22:14,012 --> 01:22:15,638
All right,

1192
01:22:16,681 --> 01:22:18,015
give me the nights.

1193
01:22:18,099 --> 01:22:19,892
What nights?

1194
01:22:19,976 --> 01:22:22,853
The drinks at night, for a month.

1195
01:22:22,896 --> 01:22:24,939
And l keep what l make from my cocktails.

1196
01:22:25,023 --> 01:22:26,774
And you buy the bottles.

1197
01:22:26,858 --> 01:22:28,901
All right, partner,

1198
01:22:28,985 --> 01:22:30,569
but not a word about this.

1199
01:22:30,654 --> 01:22:34,698
What can l do? l'm your accomplice now.

1200
01:22:34,783 --> 01:22:37,242
Just so you know, l haven't killed anyone.

1201
01:22:37,327 --> 01:22:39,036
Don't tell me anything.

1202
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:41,038
l wasn't going to.

1203
01:23:18,326 --> 01:23:21,829
Get out of the way. Give me that.

1204
01:23:38,263 --> 01:23:40,055
Oh, my God!

1205
01:23:42,434 --> 01:23:45,394
l can't do any more, l'm dead.

1206
01:23:45,437 --> 01:23:48,022
Take a break, l'll fill this in.

1207
01:24:51,503 --> 01:24:53,212
What are you doing here?

1208
01:24:56,007 --> 01:24:59,676
-Can we talk?
-l'm really busy.

1209
01:24:59,719 --> 01:25:02,012
Come in.

1210
01:25:08,186 --> 01:25:10,687
-How are you?
-The same.

1211
01:25:10,772 --> 01:25:13,690
-Have you found out anything?
-About what?

1212
01:25:13,775 --> 01:25:15,484
About what l asked you.

1213
01:25:16,528 --> 01:25:18,362
l didn't think you were serious.

1214
01:25:19,989 --> 01:25:21,907
May l sit down?

1215
01:25:26,538 --> 01:25:28,372
Have pity on me.

1216
01:25:29,249 --> 01:25:31,416
l do, all the pity you want,

1217
01:25:31,501 --> 01:25:33,210
but don't ask crazy things.

1218
01:25:33,294 --> 01:25:35,838
All l want is to know if she's alive or dead!

1219
01:25:40,552 --> 01:25:44,304
l understand that with the wind
and the cancer

1220
01:25:44,389 --> 01:25:45,848
you've lost your mind,

1221
01:25:45,890 --> 01:25:48,475
but you can't complicate
other people's lives.

1222
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:50,811
We've got enough on our plates.

1223
01:25:52,564 --> 01:25:55,774
The day your parents died in the fire,

1224
01:25:55,859 --> 01:25:58,026
my mother disappeared.

1225
01:26:01,948 --> 01:26:05,075
Don't you think that's
a strange coincidence?

1226
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:07,911
No, it's just a coincidence.

1227
01:26:08,746 --> 01:26:11,915
You said your mother left in the morning

1228
01:26:11,958 --> 01:26:14,585
and it wasn't the first time she disappeared.

1229
01:26:14,669 --> 01:26:18,672
Your grandmother had to raise you
because she was never at home.

1230
01:26:18,756 --> 01:26:20,507
Don't make me say more.

1231
01:26:20,592 --> 01:26:23,427
My mother went off that morning,

1232
01:26:23,511 --> 01:26:26,597
but it was to join your father in the hut.

1233
01:26:26,639 --> 01:26:28,765
That's a lie.

1234
01:26:28,808 --> 01:26:31,185
-No one saw her.
-Of course not.

1235
01:26:31,269 --> 01:26:33,562
She made sure of that.

1236
01:26:36,691 --> 01:26:39,985
My mother was having an affair
with your father.

1237
01:26:41,446 --> 01:26:42,821
What are you saying?

1238
01:26:44,908 --> 01:26:47,993
My mother would never have allowed it!

1239
01:26:48,077 --> 01:26:50,829
That's why she went to live
with your Aunt Paula.

1240
01:26:50,914 --> 01:26:53,832
She did that because my aunt wasn't well,

1241
01:26:53,917 --> 01:26:56,793
but she never left him.
She went between the two houses.

1242
01:26:56,878 --> 01:26:58,587
You don't know, you weren't there,

1243
01:26:58,630 --> 01:27:01,548
and you hardly had any contact
with your mother for years.

1244
01:27:01,633 --> 01:27:04,635
l often heard her complain
you treated her like shit.

1245
01:27:04,677 --> 01:27:06,053
Those were her words.

1246
01:27:08,306 --> 01:27:10,140
l've heard a lot of things.

1247
01:27:11,267 --> 01:27:13,185
Once

1248
01:27:13,269 --> 01:27:15,938
l heard a row
between your mother and mine.

1249
01:27:15,980 --> 01:27:18,649
Your mother told her she could have
your father,

1250
01:27:18,691 --> 01:27:20,067
she didn't care.

1251
01:27:20,151 --> 01:27:22,444
And she didn't envy her

1252
01:27:22,487 --> 01:27:25,739
because he'd been born to hurt
the women who loved him.

1253
01:27:28,743 --> 01:27:30,994
What are you getting at?

1254
01:27:32,580 --> 01:27:34,581
That your parents' death

1255
01:27:34,666 --> 01:27:37,501
and my mother's disappearance
are connected.

1256
01:27:40,255 --> 01:27:42,965
Then why haven't you gone to the police?

1257
01:27:43,007 --> 01:27:45,425
They ask a lot of questions,

1258
01:27:46,135 --> 01:27:49,054
and we should wash our dirty linen at home.

1259
01:27:50,348 --> 01:27:53,850
That's why l won't go on TV even though
my sister is insisting.

1260
01:27:54,644 --> 01:27:57,354
You and l have to sort this out.

1261
01:28:00,275 --> 01:28:02,526
l have to get back to work.

1262
01:28:06,239 --> 01:28:08,031
Think about what l said.

1263
01:28:08,866 --> 01:28:10,409
How's Paco?

1264
01:28:11,202 --> 01:28:12,536
What?

1265
01:28:13,204 --> 01:28:14,746
He's fine.

1266
01:28:19,752 --> 01:28:22,879
Shouldn't we call Auntie
to say we're coming?

1267
01:28:22,964 --> 01:28:24,715
She never goes out.

1268
01:28:24,757 --> 01:28:26,174
We should warn her.

1269
01:28:26,217 --> 01:28:27,718
Why?

1270
01:28:27,760 --> 01:28:31,430
lt's not polite just to turn up
at someone's house,

1271
01:28:31,514 --> 01:28:33,181
even if she is your sister.

1272
01:28:33,224 --> 01:28:35,225
What's up with you and Sole now?

1273
01:28:36,060 --> 01:28:38,562
lt's a question of manners.

1274
01:28:38,604 --> 01:28:41,523
You and your aunt are getting
on my fucking nerves!

1275
01:28:41,566 --> 01:28:43,275
You're so vulgar.

1276
01:28:48,656 --> 01:28:50,490
What have you brought, Raimunda?

1277
01:28:50,575 --> 01:28:52,659
Food for the three of us.

1278
01:28:57,206 --> 01:28:59,082
Why did you bother?

1279
01:28:59,125 --> 01:29:01,460
Why are you shouting?
Are you going deaf?

1280
01:29:01,544 --> 01:29:03,962
-Yes, l'm deaf.
-Deaf as a post.

1281
01:29:04,047 --> 01:29:07,007
We're staying a while,
l want you to cut my hair.

1282
01:29:07,091 --> 01:29:09,801
Why didn't you call? l've got a client.

1283
01:29:11,554 --> 01:29:14,222
Don't worry, l'm in no hurry.

1284
01:29:14,265 --> 01:29:16,433
And we have to talk.

1285
01:29:16,517 --> 01:29:19,144
-About what?
-Aunt Paula's house.

1286
01:29:19,228 --> 01:29:23,023
-May l go and watch TV?
-Yes, go on.

1287
01:29:23,107 --> 01:29:26,401
We have to sort out all the paperwork.

1288
01:29:27,945 --> 01:29:29,112
Grandma!

1289
01:29:30,114 --> 01:29:31,114
l'm here.

1290
01:29:31,199 --> 01:29:33,283
Don't make a sound, my mother's here.

1291
01:29:33,368 --> 01:29:34,785
l heard her.

1292
01:29:40,666 --> 01:29:42,334
Where's the Russian?

1293
01:29:42,418 --> 01:29:46,129
-Who's the Russian?
-A woman who's helping me.

1294
01:29:46,172 --> 01:29:49,383
l was telling her about my son being
expelled again.

1295
01:29:49,467 --> 01:29:52,302
He slashed the tires of the priest
who teaches him religion.

1296
01:29:52,387 --> 01:29:54,763
l was telling her, and she left me
talking to myself

1297
01:29:54,806 --> 01:29:56,723
with my hair half-washed.

1298
01:29:56,808 --> 01:29:58,183
She must have gone out.

1299
01:29:58,267 --> 01:30:00,936
l don't know, but she went off like a shot.

1300
01:30:00,978 --> 01:30:02,646
l'll finish you off.

1301
01:30:02,688 --> 01:30:05,148
She's got claustrophobia,

1302
01:30:05,191 --> 01:30:07,484
and at times she needs to go outside.

1303
01:30:07,568 --> 01:30:09,152
Some help she is.

1304
01:30:09,237 --> 01:30:10,320
Do you pay her?

1305
01:30:10,363 --> 01:30:13,073
No, l took her in.

1306
01:30:13,157 --> 01:30:16,493
She eats and sleeps here.
l gave her Mom's clothes.

1307
01:30:16,577 --> 01:30:19,413
l don't like you taking in
people you don't know.

1308
01:30:19,497 --> 01:30:22,916
We told her that.
People take advantage of her.

1309
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:26,253
Look at the Russian.
She's living in luxury here.

1310
01:30:26,337 --> 01:30:28,255
How was Paco the other night?

1311
01:30:28,339 --> 01:30:32,092
Unpleasant. He came to get his clothes.

1312
01:30:32,176 --> 01:30:36,179
l think he's living with someone,
but l couldn't care less.

1313
01:30:36,222 --> 01:30:39,474
Why didn't you tell me you had a Russian?

1314
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:42,602
l guess l forgot.

1315
01:30:50,653 --> 01:30:54,489
That's Agustina!

1316
01:30:54,574 --> 01:30:56,783
wherever you are

1317
01:30:56,868 --> 01:30:58,577
Good afternoon, Agustina.

1318
01:30:58,661 --> 01:31:00,078
Good afternoon.

1319
01:31:00,163 --> 01:31:01,621
We know from your sister

1320
01:31:01,706 --> 01:31:04,833
that your mother was a single parent.

1321
01:31:04,876 --> 01:31:09,045
My mother was a hippie.

1322
01:31:10,756 --> 01:31:12,048
That's Agustina!

1323
01:31:12,133 --> 01:31:14,301
She never married.

1324
01:31:14,385 --> 01:31:16,386
So she practiced free Iove.

1325
01:31:16,429 --> 01:31:18,638
Your mother had a friend

1326
01:31:18,723 --> 01:31:21,558
who died the same day she disappeared.

1327
01:31:22,310 --> 01:31:23,310
Yes.

1328
01:31:23,394 --> 01:31:26,563
How did she die?

1329
01:31:26,606 --> 01:31:27,647
In a fire.

1330
01:31:27,732 --> 01:31:30,609
There are lots of fires in my village,

1331
01:31:30,693 --> 01:31:32,486
because of the East wind.

1332
01:31:32,570 --> 01:31:37,574
Agustina's village is the wonderful
Alcanfor de las lnfantas,

1333
01:31:37,617 --> 01:31:39,743
which, according to statistics,

1334
01:31:39,785 --> 01:31:42,579
has the highest rate of insanity
per inhabitant.

1335
01:31:42,622 --> 01:31:46,541
Do you think that perhaps your mother
was mentally unbalanced?

1336
01:31:46,584 --> 01:31:52,923
No, when my mother wasn't well,
as she was a hippie,

1337
01:31:53,007 --> 01:31:55,091
she'd leave the village.

1338
01:31:55,176 --> 01:31:58,220
Until one day she left and never came back.

1339
01:31:58,262 --> 01:32:02,390
Yes, that was almost four years ago.

1340
01:32:02,433 --> 01:32:03,600
And that friend?

1341
01:32:03,643 --> 01:32:05,769
We're very interested in that friend
who died

1342
01:32:05,853 --> 01:32:09,439
the same day your mother disappeared.
TeII us about that.

1343
01:32:09,524 --> 01:32:11,942
About what?

1344
01:32:12,026 --> 01:32:16,863
We'd like you to tell us about
the woman who died in the fire.

1345
01:32:16,948 --> 01:32:20,116
-You know there are rumors...
-I don't beIieve in rumors.

1346
01:32:20,201 --> 01:32:23,870
I'd like you to explain what you told
our producer.

1347
01:32:23,955 --> 01:32:26,957
It was something important
about that woman and her husband

1348
01:32:27,041 --> 01:32:29,459
that Iinked them
to your mother's disappearance.

1349
01:32:29,544 --> 01:32:30,627
Is that true?

1350
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:34,005
I'd rather

1351
01:32:36,968 --> 01:32:38,385
not taIk about that.

1352
01:32:38,469 --> 01:32:41,054
Those were suppositions of mine.

1353
01:32:41,138 --> 01:32:46,476
But you're here to talk about
that woman and your mother.

1354
01:32:46,561 --> 01:32:48,562
I've changed my mind.

1355
01:32:48,646 --> 01:32:50,272
she can't believe her sister

1356
01:32:50,314 --> 01:32:53,775
What's wrong?
You look uncomfortable, a bit nervous.

1357
01:32:53,818 --> 01:32:56,903
l'd like to explain

1358
01:32:56,988 --> 01:32:59,531
that Agustina is also here to tell us

1359
01:32:59,615 --> 01:33:01,825
that she's got a terminal illness.

1360
01:33:01,909 --> 01:33:03,785
lsn't that so?

1361
01:33:03,828 --> 01:33:06,037
Agustina has got cancer.

1362
01:33:09,500 --> 01:33:11,835
You've got cancer.

1363
01:33:11,919 --> 01:33:14,963
But don't be nervous, you're among friends.

1364
01:33:15,006 --> 01:33:17,424
A big hand for Agustina!

1365
01:33:24,640 --> 01:33:27,183
Agustina has got a special wish.

1366
01:33:27,226 --> 01:33:29,811
To go to a clinic in Houston.

1367
01:33:29,854 --> 01:33:33,440
But to go to Houston,
you have to speak out.

1368
01:33:33,524 --> 01:33:36,693
Remember, you made a commitment
to this channel.

1369
01:34:04,597 --> 01:34:06,598
Agustina came to see me.

1370
01:34:06,682 --> 01:34:08,475
She did?

1371
01:34:08,559 --> 01:34:10,644
She insists that Mom appears to us.

1372
01:34:10,728 --> 01:34:12,729
She wants me to ask her about her mother.

1373
01:34:13,564 --> 01:34:16,149
She also said that when she disappeared,

1374
01:34:16,233 --> 01:34:18,193
her mother was having an affair with Dad.

1375
01:34:24,617 --> 01:34:27,369
Do you know anything about that?

1376
01:34:28,329 --> 01:34:29,663
No.

1377
01:34:31,165 --> 01:34:34,959
Well, Mom told me, after...

1378
01:34:36,879 --> 01:34:38,505
After what?

1379
01:34:38,589 --> 01:34:41,299
After she found out.

1380
01:34:44,720 --> 01:34:46,137
Look at me.

1381
01:34:49,266 --> 01:34:52,435
Are there things l should know and don't?

1382
01:34:52,478 --> 01:34:54,187
Oodles.

1383
01:34:55,439 --> 01:34:56,773
But if l tell you,

1384
01:34:56,857 --> 01:34:59,275
you'll be annoyed or you won't believe me.

1385
01:35:00,152 --> 01:35:03,279
l promise l'll believe you
and l won't be annoyed.

1386
01:35:04,949 --> 01:35:07,283
Mom's been appearing all the time.

1387
01:35:09,704 --> 01:35:10,954
To whom?

1388
01:35:11,038 --> 01:35:12,288
Sit down.

1389
01:35:18,129 --> 01:35:20,505
She was with Aunt Paula until she died.

1390
01:35:20,589 --> 01:35:23,133
lt was she who called Agustina

1391
01:35:23,175 --> 01:35:25,885
and opened the door so she could find
the body.

1392
01:35:25,970 --> 01:35:28,054
She put out the money
so they'd bring her bread

1393
01:35:28,139 --> 01:35:30,140
and left everything paid for the funeral.

1394
01:35:30,182 --> 01:35:32,809
Did you do all that?

1395
01:35:32,852 --> 01:35:34,477
Yeah.

1396
01:35:34,562 --> 01:35:37,480
Did Agustina tell you all that?

1397
01:35:39,066 --> 01:35:40,525
You don't believe me.

1398
01:35:42,319 --> 01:35:45,613
Agustina is crazy!

1399
01:35:45,656 --> 01:35:47,615
Last time we saw Auntie

1400
01:35:47,658 --> 01:35:50,535
you said yourself it was incredible

1401
01:35:50,619 --> 01:35:54,497
that she could live like that,
with her mind gone and half-blind.

1402
01:35:54,582 --> 01:35:56,332
Remember?

1403
01:35:56,417 --> 01:35:58,793
Yes, l do, but what are you saying?

1404
01:35:58,836 --> 01:36:01,588
That she wasn't alone.

1405
01:36:01,672 --> 01:36:06,217
Who do you think made the wafers
and put them in tupperwares,

1406
01:36:06,302 --> 01:36:08,887
one for each of us?

1407
01:36:08,971 --> 01:36:11,765
Who do you think took the dolls
and Auntie's valuables

1408
01:36:11,849 --> 01:36:14,100
before the neighbors swiped everything?

1409
01:36:14,185 --> 01:36:16,311
Now do you understand?

1410
01:36:20,775 --> 01:36:22,233
Have you seen her?

1411
01:36:22,318 --> 01:36:24,027
Yes.

1412
01:36:28,282 --> 01:36:30,700
ls she, by any chance,

1413
01:36:30,785 --> 01:36:31,868
the Russian?

1414
01:36:31,911 --> 01:36:34,704
Yes.

1415
01:36:35,956 --> 01:36:37,499
Where is she?

1416
01:36:40,878 --> 01:36:42,045
ln there.

1417
01:37:10,783 --> 01:37:12,826
Mom!

1418
01:37:12,910 --> 01:37:14,744
What are you doing down there?

1419
01:37:37,434 --> 01:37:40,186
Weren't you dead?

1420
01:37:40,271 --> 01:37:44,357
l've come back to ask you to forgive me.

1421
01:37:44,441 --> 01:37:48,027
l knew nothing about it.

1422
01:37:48,112 --> 01:37:50,071
l never even imagined it.

1423
01:37:54,451 --> 01:37:56,411
Come on, Paula!

1424
01:38:11,468 --> 01:38:13,011
My little girl!

1425
01:38:16,599 --> 01:38:19,267
The worst is over.

1426
01:38:19,310 --> 01:38:20,852
She's seen me,

1427
01:38:20,936 --> 01:38:23,229
and she didn't reject me, did she?

1428
01:38:23,314 --> 01:38:24,480
No.

1429
01:38:26,191 --> 01:38:28,610
Did you really come back
to ask her to forgive you?

1430
01:38:29,904 --> 01:38:32,238
And also to be with you.

1431
01:38:33,282 --> 01:38:36,159
Someday you can explain it all to me.

1432
01:38:36,243 --> 01:38:41,915
Yes, and that day l hope you understand me

1433
01:38:41,999 --> 01:38:43,875
and that you forgive me, too.

1434
01:39:11,362 --> 01:39:13,655
l have to talk to her.

1435
01:39:13,697 --> 01:39:15,615
Why don't we go back?

1436
01:39:18,786 --> 01:39:20,244
Now?

1437
01:39:20,329 --> 01:39:21,621
Sure.

1438
01:39:48,941 --> 01:39:52,568
-l've dreamt about this so often.
-So have l.

1439
01:39:54,029 --> 01:39:56,155
l don't know where to begin.

1440
01:39:57,241 --> 01:40:01,035
You're not a ghost, are you?
You're not dead.

1441
01:40:01,078 --> 01:40:02,954
No, love, l'm not.

1442
01:40:04,373 --> 01:40:06,582
That's such a relief.

1443
01:40:06,625 --> 01:40:08,126
But even if l had died,

1444
01:40:08,210 --> 01:40:10,753
l'd have come back to ask you to forgive me

1445
01:40:10,796 --> 01:40:13,214
for not seeing what was going on.

1446
01:40:13,882 --> 01:40:15,758
l was blind.

1447
01:40:16,635 --> 01:40:20,013
l found out the day of the fire.

1448
01:40:20,097 --> 01:40:22,098
Had you really left Dad?

1449
01:40:22,182 --> 01:40:24,100
Yes.

1450
01:40:24,143 --> 01:40:26,436
l couldn't stand his cheating.

1451
01:40:27,396 --> 01:40:29,605
The afternoon of the fire,

1452
01:40:29,648 --> 01:40:32,316
you rang and spoke to Auntie.

1453
01:40:33,318 --> 01:40:35,611
As usual, you didn't ask for me.

1454
01:40:36,280 --> 01:40:39,949
l got angry and told your aunt
you were heartless.

1455
01:40:40,743 --> 01:40:43,286
As l kept badmouthing you,

1456
01:40:43,829 --> 01:40:45,872
your aunt

1457
01:40:45,956 --> 01:40:47,790
defended you

1458
01:40:48,959 --> 01:40:50,960
and told me everything.

1459
01:40:56,467 --> 01:40:59,844
That your father had abused you,

1460
01:40:59,928 --> 01:41:03,514
that you'd gotten pregnant,

1461
01:41:03,599 --> 01:41:05,516
and that Paula

1462
01:41:05,601 --> 01:41:07,477
is your daughter

1463
01:41:07,561 --> 01:41:09,395
and your sister.

1464
01:41:11,231 --> 01:41:13,399
l couldn't believe it.

1465
01:41:13,484 --> 01:41:17,695
How could such a monstrous thing happen
in front of me

1466
01:41:17,780 --> 01:41:19,655
without me realizing it?

1467
01:41:21,742 --> 01:41:25,078
Then, l understood everything.

1468
01:41:25,162 --> 01:41:28,247
l understood your silence

1469
01:41:28,332 --> 01:41:29,624
and why you grew so distant.

1470
01:41:30,793 --> 01:41:35,004
l understood why your father went
to Venezuela.

1471
01:41:35,047 --> 01:41:39,675
He couldn't cope
with the shame of what he'd done.

1472
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:41,844
l understood

1473
01:41:41,929 --> 01:41:44,180
why, after marrying Paco,

1474
01:41:44,223 --> 01:41:46,307
you went to Madrid

1475
01:41:46,892 --> 01:41:49,560
and wanted nothing to do with us.

1476
01:41:49,645 --> 01:41:52,647
l hated you for not noticing anything.

1477
01:41:52,689 --> 01:41:55,983
And you were right, love.

1478
01:41:56,026 --> 01:41:58,611
When l found out,

1479
01:41:58,695 --> 01:42:01,948
l was like a wild thing.

1480
01:42:02,032 --> 01:42:05,243
l went to the hut,
ready to scratch his eyes out!

1481
01:42:05,327 --> 01:42:08,371
l found him asleep with Agustina's mother,

1482
01:42:08,455 --> 01:42:10,540
both of them worn out.

1483
01:42:10,624 --> 01:42:13,042
They didn't see me.

1484
01:42:13,085 --> 01:42:15,753
l set fire to the hut.

1485
01:42:15,838 --> 01:42:17,839
lt was a windy day,

1486
01:42:17,881 --> 01:42:21,217
and in no time
the flames had devoured everything.

1487
01:42:22,052 --> 01:42:24,345
They didn't have time to wake up.

1488
01:42:26,056 --> 01:42:27,932
The ashes in your grave

1489
01:42:28,016 --> 01:42:30,560
are those ofAgustina's mother?

1490
01:42:31,478 --> 01:42:32,728
Yes.

1491
01:42:36,984 --> 01:42:38,568
Afterwards,

1492
01:42:38,610 --> 01:42:43,656
l wandered the countryside for a few days,

1493
01:42:43,740 --> 01:42:45,199
hiding,

1494
01:42:45,242 --> 01:42:48,161
like an animal.

1495
01:42:48,245 --> 01:42:49,704
l was going to give myself up,

1496
01:42:49,746 --> 01:42:51,789
but first

1497
01:42:51,874 --> 01:42:54,876
l went to Paula's house to see her.

1498
01:42:55,794 --> 01:42:58,629
She was in a terrible state.

1499
01:42:58,714 --> 01:43:01,132
When she saw me,

1500
01:43:01,216 --> 01:43:03,926
she wasn't at all surprised.

1501
01:43:03,969 --> 01:43:08,431
l came from the past, where she was living.

1502
01:43:08,473 --> 01:43:12,518
She greeted me as if l had just gone
out the door.

1503
01:43:13,854 --> 01:43:17,064
With the tragedy, she lost what little
reason she had.

1504
01:43:17,107 --> 01:43:20,109
l couldn't leave her on her own,

1505
01:43:20,152 --> 01:43:25,114
so l stayed and looked after her

1506
01:43:25,157 --> 01:43:26,949
until she died.

1507
01:43:30,996 --> 01:43:33,998
ln the village they think you're a ghost.

1508
01:43:34,082 --> 01:43:37,126
That's the good thing
about such superstitious places.

1509
01:43:37,211 --> 01:43:40,838
lt was easier for me to go along with them

1510
01:43:40,923 --> 01:43:42,506
than to speak the truth.

1511
01:43:42,591 --> 01:43:45,551
l thought l'd be arrested.

1512
01:43:45,636 --> 01:43:49,096
l never imagined
that no one would investigate

1513
01:43:49,139 --> 01:43:51,265
or punish me,

1514
01:43:51,308 --> 01:43:54,477
although all this time

1515
01:43:54,519 --> 01:43:57,813
l swear l've been in a living purgatory.

1516
01:44:03,028 --> 01:44:04,570
Never better said.

1517
01:44:24,925 --> 01:44:27,176
lt's too early to go to the village.

1518
01:44:27,219 --> 01:44:28,803
We shouldn't arrive in daylight.

1519
01:44:28,845 --> 01:44:31,597
Why don't we drive by the river?

1520
01:44:31,682 --> 01:44:33,808
lt's been so long since l saw it.

1521
01:44:33,850 --> 01:44:36,352
lt's not what it was. lt's dry.

1522
01:44:36,436 --> 01:44:38,062
How do you know?

1523
01:44:39,064 --> 01:44:42,191
Because there's a drought all over Spain.

1524
01:44:42,234 --> 01:44:43,776
Don't you know?

1525
01:45:03,005 --> 01:45:07,049
We used to come here for picnics.
Remember, Raimunda?

1526
01:45:07,092 --> 01:45:08,968
Yes.

1527
01:45:09,052 --> 01:45:11,762
There was more water then.

1528
01:45:11,847 --> 01:45:13,848
l told you it was dry.

1529
01:45:13,890 --> 01:45:15,808
Shall we eat something?

1530
01:45:15,892 --> 01:45:17,935
Not for me.

1531
01:45:18,020 --> 01:45:20,688
-l'm going to eat a wafer.
-Me too.

1532
01:45:31,116 --> 01:45:33,409
This was your father's favorite place.

1533
01:45:34,536 --> 01:45:35,995
Paco's?

1534
01:45:36,580 --> 01:45:37,663
Yes.

1535
01:45:39,416 --> 01:45:42,126
lt was the only thing he missed.

1536
01:45:42,210 --> 01:45:43,419
This river.

1537
01:46:03,774 --> 01:46:06,108
l'm glad he's resting here.

1538
01:46:18,455 --> 01:46:20,247
Come on. Nobody'll see you now.

1539
01:46:36,056 --> 01:46:38,641
lf Paula were alive

1540
01:46:38,683 --> 01:46:41,102
and could see us now,

1541
01:46:41,144 --> 01:46:43,145
all together,

1542
01:46:43,188 --> 01:46:45,314
she'd be so happy.

1543
01:46:52,072 --> 01:46:54,448
Have you always had such a big chest?

1544
01:46:55,367 --> 01:46:57,701
Yes, since l was little.

1545
01:46:57,786 --> 01:47:00,496
l remembered you having less.

1546
01:47:01,331 --> 01:47:03,290
Have you had anything done?

1547
01:47:03,333 --> 01:47:05,459
No! What a thing to say!

1548
01:47:05,502 --> 01:47:07,253
All right.

1549
01:47:07,337 --> 01:47:09,463
Grandma, did you ride the bike?

1550
01:47:09,506 --> 01:47:11,799
Yes, half an hour every day.

1551
01:47:11,842 --> 01:47:13,926
lt's good for blood pressure and the heart.

1552
01:47:14,010 --> 01:47:16,011
What did Aunt Paula say?

1553
01:47:16,096 --> 01:47:19,682
She roared laughing.

1554
01:47:21,977 --> 01:47:23,060
Bye.

1555
01:47:26,565 --> 01:47:27,940
lt's Aunt Paula...

1556
01:47:28,024 --> 01:47:29,692
Don't start.

1557
01:47:30,652 --> 01:47:31,986
l'll get it.

1558
01:47:32,821 --> 01:47:35,156
Hide Mom's plate and cutlery.

1559
01:47:41,204 --> 01:47:44,081
-Who is it?
-Agustina.

1560
01:47:47,419 --> 01:47:49,712
We're having supper. We've just arrived.

1561
01:47:49,796 --> 01:47:51,422
l'm sorry to bother you.

1562
01:47:52,507 --> 01:47:54,216
Don't stay out there.

1563
01:47:54,801 --> 01:47:55,926
Thank you.

1564
01:48:00,599 --> 01:48:02,391
Good evening.

1565
01:48:03,852 --> 01:48:06,353
-Sit down.
-Thank you.

1566
01:48:13,320 --> 01:48:16,655
l came to apologize about the show.

1567
01:48:16,740 --> 01:48:19,867
You shouldn't have done it.
lt wasn't right.

1568
01:48:19,910 --> 01:48:21,076
l know that.

1569
01:48:21,161 --> 01:48:23,078
lt's no excuse,

1570
01:48:23,163 --> 01:48:25,080
but they offered to take me to Houston.

1571
01:48:25,123 --> 01:48:27,583
They cure everything there.

1572
01:48:27,667 --> 01:48:29,001
But l couldn't do it.

1573
01:48:29,085 --> 01:48:33,214
l'd rather die alone in my house,
but at peace,

1574
01:48:33,256 --> 01:48:35,591
and able to look you in the eye.

1575
01:48:37,552 --> 01:48:41,472
-Mom, l'm going to bed, all right?
-Yes, go on.

1576
01:48:43,391 --> 01:48:46,227
-Will you have some supper?
-No, thanks.

1577
01:48:46,269 --> 01:48:49,605
l heard you're going to sell the house.

1578
01:48:49,689 --> 01:48:52,942
We'd thought about it, but now we're here...

1579
01:48:53,026 --> 01:48:55,611
There are so many memories.

1580
01:48:55,695 --> 01:48:59,156
Well, l have to go.

1581
01:48:59,241 --> 01:49:01,951
Why don't you stay a while?

1582
01:49:01,993 --> 01:49:05,788
l have to go to the nurse to get my injection.

1583
01:49:05,830 --> 01:49:08,958
ln Madrid they told me to learn
to do it myself,

1584
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,210
but it gives me the creeps.

1585
01:49:11,294 --> 01:49:15,297
Your sister is unforgivable.
Leaving you alone like this.

1586
01:49:15,382 --> 01:49:17,174
Don't even mention her.

1587
01:49:17,259 --> 01:49:20,553
As l didn't say what they wanted
on television,

1588
01:49:20,637 --> 01:49:22,304
she's not speaking to me.

1589
01:49:22,347 --> 01:49:26,016
She's very angry with me.
But l'm even angrier with her.

1590
01:49:26,101 --> 01:49:28,018
With good reason.

1591
01:49:28,103 --> 01:49:30,104
l envy you two.

1592
01:49:30,981 --> 01:49:33,190
You're so close.

1593
01:49:53,044 --> 01:49:55,337
lrene!

1594
01:49:55,422 --> 01:49:58,424
l've longed to see you.

1595
01:49:58,508 --> 01:50:00,843
Here l am.

1596
01:50:00,885 --> 01:50:02,511
l heard about your problem,

1597
01:50:02,596 --> 01:50:05,723
and l can imagine how lonely you are.

1598
01:50:05,807 --> 01:50:07,683
Very lonely.

1599
01:50:11,271 --> 01:50:13,522
lf only Paula were here...

1600
01:50:13,565 --> 01:50:16,233
l'm here to look after you.

1601
01:50:16,318 --> 01:50:18,527
You left the door open.

1602
01:50:18,570 --> 01:50:20,946
Don't worry, l closed it.

1603
01:50:21,031 --> 01:50:22,823
Did you go to the nurse?

1604
01:50:22,866 --> 01:50:25,534
No, l'm very tired. Tomorrow.

1605
01:50:25,577 --> 01:50:28,787
Tomorrow you'll be in a lot of pain.

1606
01:50:28,872 --> 01:50:31,707
Have you got the medicine and the needles?

1607
01:50:31,791 --> 01:50:33,375
Yes, l bought it all in Madrid.

1608
01:50:33,418 --> 01:50:36,003
Good, l'll give you the injection.

1609
01:50:41,843 --> 01:50:43,969
l was born in this bed.

1610
01:50:45,472 --> 01:50:47,890
My mother slept here.

1611
01:50:47,974 --> 01:50:52,227
And in this bed
we held your sister Paula's wake.

1612
01:50:52,312 --> 01:50:54,438
l know,

1613
01:50:54,522 --> 01:50:56,607
and l'm so grateful.

1614
01:51:00,612 --> 01:51:03,572
We have to talk, lrene.

1615
01:51:03,615 --> 01:51:06,075
About everything you want.

1616
01:51:06,117 --> 01:51:08,577
But don't tell anyone l've come back.

1617
01:51:08,662 --> 01:51:11,330
Don't worry.

1618
01:51:12,707 --> 01:51:15,668
Thank you for not talking about me
on television.

1619
01:51:17,128 --> 01:51:19,755
lt's our own business.

1620
01:51:20,298 --> 01:51:22,091
That's right,

1621
01:51:22,133 --> 01:51:24,301
and no one else's.

1622
01:52:31,828 --> 01:52:35,164
Mom, it's me, let me in!

1623
01:52:37,041 --> 01:52:39,626
What are you doing here? Come in.

1624
01:52:41,004 --> 01:52:42,171
l missed you.

1625
01:52:42,255 --> 01:52:46,467
-Are you going to stay here?
-Yes, until the end.

1626
01:52:46,509 --> 01:52:48,135
Agustina is very ill.

1627
01:52:48,178 --> 01:52:49,970
After what l did to her mother,

1628
01:52:50,013 --> 01:52:52,848
the least l can do is look after her
until she dies.

1629
01:52:52,932 --> 01:52:56,810
l have so much to tell you.

1630
01:52:56,853 --> 01:52:59,396
l haven't told you about Paco
or what l've done.

1631
01:52:59,481 --> 01:53:02,900
l'm dying to hear everything,
but go away now.

1632
01:53:02,984 --> 01:53:06,695
l'll see you every day.
Between us we'll manage.

1633
01:53:06,738 --> 01:53:07,821
Yes.

1634
01:53:10,533 --> 01:53:12,659
l need you, Mom.

1635
01:53:14,913 --> 01:53:18,415
l don't know how l lived all these years
without you.

1636
01:53:18,500 --> 01:53:20,459
Don't say that.

1637
01:53:20,543 --> 01:53:23,045
l'll start to cry,

1638
01:53:23,129 --> 01:53:25,380
and ghosts don't cry.
