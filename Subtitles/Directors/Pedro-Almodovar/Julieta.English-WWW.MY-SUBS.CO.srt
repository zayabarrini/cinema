1
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,925
Hello, Lorenzo.
<i>Hello </i>.

2
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,107
I'll open up.

3
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,085
How are you?

4
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,406
I'm a mess.

5
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,681
Why?

6
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,410
I don't know what books to take.

7
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,407
Just the essentials.
If you miss one,

8
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,449
You can buy it on the Internet.

9
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:37,002
I don't like to buy books that
I have, it makes me feel older.

10
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,888
Right now you look like a girl.

11
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,407
Well, besides the books,
do you have much to do?

12
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,643
I still have to
do some shopping.

13
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,281
Julieta, we're going to Portugal,
not the desert,

14
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,607
You can return to
Madrid anytime.

15
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,247
I won't come back to Madrid,
if I can help it.

16
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,006
<i>Come here...</i>

17
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,927
Thank you.

18
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,327
For what?

19
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,889
For not leaving me to grow old alone.

20
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,048
It's you who won't leave me on my own.

21
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,681
Julieta?

22
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,926
Bea!

23
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:27,167
I can't believe it, Julieta?

24
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,646
What a surprise!

25
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,124
Just a week ago I saw
your daughter at Lake Como!

26
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,170
<i>Did you see Antía?</i>

27
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,089
Imagine!
We were looking and...

28
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,771
I called her because
she didn't recognize me.

29
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,089
But you're just the same, Julieta.
Better, even.

30
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,560
What did she say?

31
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,969
She was going down to the city to buy
things for their children...

32
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,162
She has three.
Two boys and a girl!

33
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,843
Yes... I don't know how she manages.
Do you have children?

34
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,167
No, no. I'm not even married.

35
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,329
I'm sorry, but I'm in a hurry.

36
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,807
You don't know how happy I am
to see you so well, Julieta.

37
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,606
Where do you live?

38
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,645
In Milan and New York.

39
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,005
I'm editor of Vogue supplements.
I travel a lot.

40
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,122
I went to Lake Como to
do a photo shoot.

41
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,611
Good!
Well...

42
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,324
Hey, say hi to your mother.

43
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,765
<i>Mum died three years ago.</i>

44
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,927
Sorry.

45
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,767
My brother lives here. We're going to a
restaurant with him and with my nieces,

46
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,361
But we're late.

47
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:25,365
Antía - what else did she say?

48
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,082
Not much. I asked about you and she said
you were still living here in Madrid.

49
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,526
And look, what a coincidence!

50
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,961
Yes. Here I am. And here I will be.

51
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,769
Did you think she looked well?

52
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:40,084
Yes. Well, and she had a clean face.
Very thin, but pretty, huh?

53
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,730
Really, I'm glad to see
you so well, Julieta.

54
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,881
Goodbye.

55
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,281
Well, what was that about?

56
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,643
Sorry, she is the mother of
a friend when I was little...

57
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,668
- Yes
- <i>It's me, let me in.</i>

58
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,041
Hi

59
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,304
Are you okay?
The water's boiling

60
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,808
I called last night and you didn't answer

61
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,924
I needed be alone.

62
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,523
Have you finished with
the suitcases and the boxes?

63
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,871
I've unpacked everything.

64
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,246
- I'm staying in Madrid, Lorenzo.
- Is this a joke?

65
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,605
<i>What is this nonsense?</i>

66
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,691
- I won’t be able to go with you.
- Why? What happened?

67
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,249
I know you feel you deserve to know,
but please don't ask me.

68
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,407
I'm not going with you to Portugal,
I'm staying in Madrid.

69
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,325
What, Julieta?

70
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,001
I've thought about it and...

71
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,527
Don't tell me that you hadn't
already thought about it!

72
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,603
We've been planning this for nearly a year!

73
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,144
Yesterday you said:
"I won't return to Madrid if I can help it."

74
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,764
What's happened so suddenly?

75
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,805
Don't insist, please.

76
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,905
Can you get me a glass of water?

77
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,923
I don't recognize you, Julieta.
You're behaving like a madwoman.

78
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,801
I know.

79
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,881
<i>I can't believe we're
talking about this!</i>

80
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,128
Last night I realized
that I was lying,

81
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,851
I don't want to leave Madrid.
And I'd rather be alone.

82
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,404
I always knew there was something
important in your life...

83
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,082
..that you never shared with me.

84
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:37,770
You never wanted to talk about it,
and I always respected that.

85
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,688
I'd like you to keep respecting that.

86
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,091
Hello, Inocencio!

87
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,281
Ms Julieta! It's been ages!

88
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,088
Yes, a long time.
Has there been any mail for me?

89
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,768
In all these years? No.

90
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,531
I just got back to Madrid

91
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,530
And I'd like to rent my apartment.
Is it free?

92
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,246
<i>No. I thought you weren't in Spain.</i>

93
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:44,204
Yes, but I'm back. And I miss this street.
Is there another one free?

94
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,841
Well... the second one
on the left is empty.

95
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,522
How wonderful! Can I see it?

96
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,563
There's no furniture, and it's not painted.

97
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,426
That doesn't matter.

98
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,645
I'll get the key.

99
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,087
It is a little dirty,
as I warned you.

100
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,805
I'll take it, Inocencio.

101
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,128
But it's not ready, Ms Julieta.

102
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,123
If you give me your phone number,
I'll call you.

103
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,530
No need, really. As long as the kitchen
and bathroom are working.

104
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,271
I'll take care of the rest.

105
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,290
The kitchen and bathroom are new.

106
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,426
That's great.

107
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,646
<i>Antía.</i>

108
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,604
<i>Two sons and a daughter.</i>

109
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,922
<i>She has gone to Lake Como to shop.</i>

110
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,644
<i>Maybe she lives in
an expensive Swiss village,</i>

111
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,851
<i>And she has gone to shop in Italy,
which is much cheaper.</i>

112
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,771
<i>She doesn't wear makeup.</i>

113
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,846
<i>And is thin.</i>

114
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,328
<i>She thinks I'm still living in Madrid.</i>

115
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,406
<i>Dear Antía:</i>

116
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,010
<i>I'll tell you everything that
I couldn't tell you,</i>

117
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,601
<i>because you were a child,</i>

118
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:03,203
<i>because it was too painful for me
or I was afraid.</i>

119
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,884
<i>But you're no longer a child.</i>

120
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,926
<i>Beatriz told me you
have your own children.</i>

121
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,689
<i>Three, no less.</i>

122
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,410
<i>You're a grown woman, and a mother.</i>

123
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,566
<i>Where do I begin?</i>

124
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,410
<i>I think, with your father.</i>

125
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,808
<i> When you ask how I met him,
I would say it was on a train</i>

126
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,246
<i>But that wouldn't be enough for you.</i>

127
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,089
<i>I was 25 years old.</i>

128
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,963
<i>It was a wild night
and very windy.</i>

129
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,130
Is this seat free?

130
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,286
Yes.

131
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,163
That was a big branch.

132
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,886
Did it frighten you?

133
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,687
Yes.

134
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,726
Are you travelling alone?

135
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,041
Yes.

136
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,890
When I saw one person here, I thought:

137
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,725
"Let's see how we get on."

138
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,890
You don't feel like talking.

139
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:39,921
What a pity!

140
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,925
Sorry, I have to leave.

141
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,083
I hope he won't get
too close to the train.

142
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,205
He is not afraid of the train.

143
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,125
He's looking for a female.

144
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,365
The smell in the air.

145
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,685
Do you want a drink?

146
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,950
<i>Xoan told me he was called Xoan,
and I said I was Julieta.</i>

147
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,729
<i>He told me he was married,
and Ana, his wife,</i>

148
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,668
<i>She had been in a coma for five years.</i>

149
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,081
<i>I said I taught
classical philology,</i>

150
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,366
<i>And was substituting
for a sick teacher.</i>

151
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:09,151
<i>Xoan told me he was a fisherman,
who had three gamelas.</i>

152
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:13,250
<i>He was going to Madrid to buy
a motor for one of them.</i>

153
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,465
<i>He told me that he had lived
by the sea all his life</i>

154
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:21,764
<i>In a house his grandfather
bought when he came over from Cuba.</i>

155
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,761
Ten minute stop!

156
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,045
Ten minute stop!

157
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,211
Ten minute stop!

158
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,329
Would you like to
stretch your legs?

159
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,746
I'm not really dressed for it.
Thank you.

160
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,921
See you soon.

161
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,360
- God!, What's happening?
- The train has stopped.

162
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,021
<i>Why? So suddenly?</i>

163
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,481
Yes, please, go back in.
Don't worry, it's nothing.

164
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,802
I was almost killed by a bag
that fell on my head.

165
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,409
Are you okay?
Have we hit something?

166
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,121
I saw a deer running alongside the train.

167
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,349
No, my god.
What a thing to say!

168
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:14,204
- Yeah, me too, I saw it.
- No, we haven't hit anything.

169
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,206
Please return to your seats
and don't block the corridor.

170
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,402
The train is going
to start right away.

171
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,224
- Well, I saw a deer.
- Yes, and don't be so rude.

172
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,206
Have you seen the man who was...
sitting there?

173
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:32,822
- The glasses and black jersey?
Yes, I saw him down the hall.

174
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,805
- He went out there.
- Onto the platform when we stopped.

175
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,770
I saw him walking through the snow.

176
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,847
He was going without a coat, so I noticed.
I think it was "mamao".

177
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:46,122
Maybe we stopped because
he was still hanging around the station.

178
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,866
Take it !!

179
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,605
What are you doing here?
Get back on the train! You'll catch pneumonia!

180
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,486
What was he wearing...
..on the stretcher?

181
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,867
- What?
- Was it the deer?

182
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,327
- No. Why do you say that?
- Was it a man?

183
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,041
Let's get on.

184
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,401
Is that why we stopped?

185
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:07,563
A man with a black sweater
and wearing glasses

186
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,610
Let's get back on the train.

187
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,849
He was sitting where you are now.

188
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:27,041
He wanted to talk, but it
annoyed me the way he stared,

189
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,366
So I ran away.

190
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,403
How was I supposed to know it was so bad?

191
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,723
Any girl would
have done the same thing.

192
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,164
I should have realized!

193
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,250
Don't torture yourself.
He would have killed himself anyway.

194
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,085
Why was he carrying an empty suitcase?

195
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:46,970
I don't know, I guess he didn't
want to attract attention.

196
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,167
But he had planned it before
boarding the train

197
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:54,562
Nobody commits suicide because a girl,
even one as beautiful as you,

198
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,091
Doesn't want to talk to him.

199
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,045
I can't sleep.

200
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,640
Me neither.

201
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,929
"Thalassa, Hals and Pontos".

202
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:57,090
The three words mean
"sea" in Greek.

203
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,443
"Pontos" is the sea.

204
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,048
And refers to the sea as a path,
the path of adventure.

205
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:06,004
So Ulysses is the marine
hero par excellence.

206
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,608
For example, when Ulysses arrives
on the island of Calypso

207
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:13,851
Exhausted after a shipwreck,
the nymph Calypso,

208
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,167
<i>She was not just pretty, no...</i>

209
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:19,366
Marcos, who you think is
the most beautiful woman?

210
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,687
You.

211
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,368
It's not worth it because
I am the teacher

212
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,364
And it's inappropriate that teachers
have sex with their students.

213
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,722
OK? Give me another one.
Kim Basinger.

214
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,605
Very cute.
Much prettier than me, too.

215
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,966
- Angela Molina.

216
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:37,205
Also beautiful. So if you combined
Kim Basinger and Angela Molina,

217
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,889
That was the nymph Calypso and
she offered Ulysses everything imaginable.

218
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:46,767
Let's see, Diego, she offered him
something really important?

219
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,241
- Her body.

220
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:52,321
That comes first. But also?
Something that we all have dreamed of.

221
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,090
- Eternal youth.
Exactly.

222
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:59,640
And immortality.
However, Ulysses rejected her.

223
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:03,763
And jumped into the sea to
face a host of dangers.

224
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:08,206
Which of the three words would you
choose to use to mean 'the sea'.

225
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,890
As used by Ulysses?

226
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,290
- Thalassa?
- No.!

227
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,722
- Pontos.
That's it, Pontos. Pontos, the sea,

228
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:19,806
The sea, the path to
adventure and the unknown.

229
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,981
Come in.

230
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:38,567
- Hello.
- Hello, Julieta. Please sit down.

231
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,521
Thank you.

232
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,728
Professor Martinez
is back next week, so...

233
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:49,002
..your period of substitution
will be finishing.

234
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:53,761
We are very pleased with your work.
Very pleased, really, Julieta.

235
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:57,523
We've never had such assistance
in classical literature classes.

236
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:01,647
Thank you.
I really enjoyed these six months.

237
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,245
Good, I'm glad.

238
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,249
Well... Wait.

239
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,968
This letter came for you...

240
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,606
Is it for you, Julieta?

241
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,010
Yes, yes...

242
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:23,245
<i>Dear Julieta:
I don't know if you're still working at this school</i>

243
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:26,730
<i>I hope so, as this is the
only address I have.</i>

244
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,169
<i>I remember a lot about you.</i>

245
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,042
<i>I can't stop thinking about
that night on the train...</i>

246
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,529
<i>Ana remains the same, or worse.</i>

247
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:39,090
<i>Although I was only away for two days,
she seemed worse.</i>

248
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,966
<i>But you don't want to hear
about those things.</i>

249
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,645
<i>I didn't go fishing today.</i>

250
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,889
<i>The sea is very choppy and
there will be a storm this afternoon.</i>

251
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,721
<i>I'd like to see you appear in the rain,</i>

252
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:57,609
<i>Looking for a place to take shelter,
and that place was my home...</i>

253
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,561
Hey... Well...

254
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,325
Canelo, get down!

255
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,286
Hello.

256
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,560
I think you're late.
The funeral was yesterday.

257
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,769
But come in if you want
and have a coffee.

258
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,785
I take care of the house.

259
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,026
Come, Canelo!

260
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,891
Leave that there.
Let's go into the kitchen.

261
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,165
When did you meet Ana?

262
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,209
Ana?
No, I didn't know her...

263
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,601
I just assumed,

264
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,391
Because she hadn't moved from
here in the last six years.

265
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,686
The sea!

266
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,922
It's impressive the
first time, right?

267
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,327
Sit down.

268
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,568
So, you've come to see Xoan.

269
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,009
- Do you want some pasta?
- No.

270
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,049
I don't think he'll be back tonight,
he is with Ava.

271
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,506
Do you know Ava?

272
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,183
She makes ceramics and sculptures.

273
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:11,127
Ana and Ava were very friendly, when
Ana was still talking and could hear.

274
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:16,521
The poor thing became a vegetable,
and a man needs a woman.

275
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:23,191
But I'm not one to criticize Xoan.

276
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,646
More coffee?

277
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,330
- No.
- Then I'll take the cup.

278
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,844
Well, what will you do?

279
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,127
You still have time
to catch the bus at eight.

280
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,210
It leaves right here in the square.

281
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,321
Come on.

282
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:47,684
If you want, you can come to my house
and then go with my husband.

283
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,211
It will be fine.

284
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:53,520
I'm tired... I'd rather wait here,
if you don't mind.

285
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,967
Where?

286
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,650
Well, right there in the hall.

287
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,721
Alone?

288
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,640
Well...

289
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,969
I would stay with you, but I can't.

290
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,402
I have neglected my husband lately.

291
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:10,841
Well...

292
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,201
Canelo will keep you company, anyway.

293
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,187
Thank you.

294
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:20,241
And don't fall asleep and miss the bus.

295
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,569
I can call on the phone just in case?

296
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,287
No need.

297
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,361
I'll call.

298
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,088
Canelo, come here.

299
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,123
Hello, hello...
What?

300
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,122
Come here.
Up... Up...

301
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,691
Don't wake up...

302
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,888
- I got your letter and came.
- Shhh...

303
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,809
But I didn't imagine that your wife...

304
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,085
Don't think about that now.

305
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:15,966
Good morning.

306
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,291
What rich pasta!

307
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,851
It's typical of this place.

308
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:26,091
I'm making breakfast.
Are you very hungry...

309
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,606
And is there anything for me?

310
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,281
Something I will...

311
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:41,002
When I got your letter, I assumed
it was an invitation to come and see you.

312
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,725
That was my intention.

313
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:47,842
I didn't think that your
wife had died. I'm sorry.

314
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,726
It was for the best... That wasn't life.

315
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,846
Marian called me to say
that you had left,

316
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,362
That you were waiting for the bus,
but I wasn't sure it was you.

317
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,040
She said you were with a woman.
Ava, I think.

318
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:10,322
She's an old friend. You will meet her.
She's an artist, like you.

319
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,606
I'm not an artist.

320
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:16,888
I teach classical literature.
And now, not even that.

321
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,362
Well, I'm sure you like her,
you'll see.

322
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,564
I think I'll leave today.

323
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,690
I don't really know what to do here.

324
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:31,648
Fishing. It's a good day today.
We're going to go fishing.

325
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:36,687
- Marian, Julieta...
I think you've met.

326
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,009
Give me that. I'll do it

327
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,321
Are you staying today?

328
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:46,801
Yes.

329
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,846
We're going fishing.

330
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:06,564
<i>I didn't have any work,
so there was no hurry...</i>

331
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,888
<i>I just stayed a few days.</i>

332
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:14,926
<i>I had to say something to Xoan,
but I postponed it.</i>

333
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,802
<i>It was a new, strange life for a
woman who comes from the sun,</i>

334
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,651
<i>But cozy.</i>

335
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,570
<i>At night I flew into
the arms of Xoan.</i>

336
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:31,521
<i>I felt both trapped, and free.</i>

337
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,561
Can I touch it?

338
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,849
Sure, take it if you want.

339
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:43,242
- It's heavy!
- Four kilos, so be careful.

340
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,006
I thought it was terracotta.

341
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,329
It's bronze, but I finish it
with a patina of terracotta.

342
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,802
The colour of the rocks
by the lighthouse.

343
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,331
You're so clever!

344
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:57,400
I try to keep my sculptures compact,

345
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:01,567
So the wind can't blow them away,
like the people here.

346
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,044
The people here are very tough.

347
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:12,167
<i>I visited Ava a lot, I liked
watching her working and smoking.</i>

348
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:16,567
<i>And she liked me to tell
mythological histories,</i>

349
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,123
<i>Like you, when you were little.</i>

350
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,570
The gods created man
and other beings

351
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,769
Out of clay and fire.

352
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:31,362
They gave them the attributes
necessary for their survival,

353
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:36,291
They gave some of them fur
and others, wings to fly.

354
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:41,087
When it was the turn of man,
the gods found

355
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,328
That they had run out of gifts,

356
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:49,848
So man was born naked, helpless,
in the midst of nature.

357
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,524
I'm pregnant, Ava.

358
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,241
Who?

359
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:02,165
Xoan.
I was already pregnant in Madrid.

360
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,846
And he knows?

361
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,807
No.

362
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:09,960
I don't want to pressure him.

363
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,882
You have to tell him,
Xoan adores children.

364
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:20,283
<i>A few months after the birth,
we took you to your grandparents,</i>

365
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,920
<i>So they met you and Xoan.</i>

366
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,162
<i>Two years later,
I went back to see them.</i>

367
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:29,047
<i>Your grandfather had
taken early retirement.</i>

368
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:32,522
<i>He had been the village teacher
and had left to become a farmer.</i>

369
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:36,566
<i>He had sold the house
I had grown up in,</i>

370
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:38,967
<i>And bought another in the country.</i>

371
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,931
Look, there they are.

372
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,045
Do you need anything else?

373
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:10,164
- No, nothing else. Thank you very much.
- So well behaved. Hey!

374
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:19,409
- Hello, daughter. Hi, and who are you?
Look!

375
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,849
Give grandfather a kiss ?

376
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,246
How was the trip?

377
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,442
Very long, really! We're exhausted.

378
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:31,010
Look, I'll introduce you.
This is Sana'a... Julieta.

379
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,451
- Hello.
- Sorry...

380
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,610
- And this wonder is Antia.

381
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,121
Do you have any luggage?

382
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:39,763
Yes. It's brown, with my name.

383
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,291
- Can you get it?
-  Yes.

384
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,610
And a stroller.

385
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,721
And mama?

386
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,606
Good. We've settled down.
You'll see.

387
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,806
What about this girl?

388
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,408
That's Sana'a,
the girl I told you about.

389
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,369
Is she the woman who helps you?

390
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,406
She deals with Mama
and gives me a hand on the land.

391
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:03,571
She was a lucky find.
She changed my life.

392
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,645
Come, come to the car.

393
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,131
- Don't you miss school?
- I don't have time.

394
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:12,651
Between your mother and the land,
I'm busy all day.

395
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:17,924
That's not retiring.
And definitely not early retirement.

396
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,605
We are fine.

397
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:23,126
Your mother and I had always
dreamed of living in the country.

398
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,246
Do you speak Spanish, Sana'a?

399
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,881
- A little.

400
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,687
A little?

401
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:32,967
A little.

402
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:37,246
- She talks divinely,
she's a just little shy.

403
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:41,767
We met eight years ago at the
Festival of Sacred Music in Fez.

404
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,563
She was very fond of your mother
and kept in touch with her.

405
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,520
It is fortunate that
she's now living with us.

406
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,601
How pretty.

407
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:57,441
The house has no frills,
but we've gained in our quality of life.

408
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,930
Where is Mum's room?

409
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,889
That window overlooking the vine.

410
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:06,370
Do you like the house? Yes?

411
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,206
I'll show you the house after.

412
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,727
Yes. Now I want to see Mama.

413
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,207
See if you're lucky
and she is awake.

414
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,123
Sara, Julieta's here.

415
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,046
Julieta.

416
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,204
- Yes Julieta, our daughter...

417
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,565
- Our daughter...

418
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,247
Hello, Mama.

419
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,371
We're here.

420
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,685
Aren't you glad to see us?

421
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,205
This is Antia.

422
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:17,051
Of course, you don't recognize her
now she's so big.

423
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:23,165
- We have prepared the room opposite.
So you're closer.

424
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,329
No, I'd rather stay here.

425
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,210
I'll sleep with Mama.

426
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,886
And the baby will sleep
on the small bed.

427
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:37,891
I'll tell Sana'a to
make up the small bed.

428
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,930
That's where she sleeps.

429
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,766
Julieta!

430
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,766
Mama...

431
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,931
What are you doing here?

432
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:30,169
I came to see you.
I brought my baby girl.

433
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,721
What girl?

434
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:37,169
Antia, my daughter.

435
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:46,761
Look at her.

436
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,086
How beautiful she is!

437
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,811
She's already two years old.

438
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,091
Two years ...

439
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,127
Cookie...

440
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:44,883
Antia look, I've got some
beautiful strawberries.

441
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,524
No papa, not now,
we've just got changed.

442
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,750
But don't you have anything
to say to Mama?

443
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,924
You look gorgeous, Sara.

444
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,727
- Now I have all the jars.
- Very good.

445
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,928
Papa, I can talk to you?
Yes, of course.

446
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:09,704
-  Sana'a can you check on Sara and the baby.
- Very good.

447
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:12,168
But don't wake the baby.

448
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,721
How does it work with Mum
when you go to the market?

449
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,248
One of us is always with her.

450
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:23,284
When you came to pick me up
at the station, she was alone

451
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:25,405
Locked in her room.

452
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:29,203
I don't like locking her, Julieta.
I do it to protect it her.

453
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,210
That's no life.

454
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,841
Julieta, we're all doing as well as we can.

455
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:37,926
Do you know what it would cost to
put your mother in a nursing home?

456
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:40,168
I thought you hired a
woman to care for her.

457
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,686
Sana'a does.

458
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,848
Sana'a looks after the land and you.

459
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:46,124
Don't go there, Julieta.

460
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:50,203
Mama needs more than someone
who cleans and makes the bed.

461
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:54,728
You have your life,
unfortunately a long way from here.

462
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:56,888
I've tried to disturb you
as little as possible,

463
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,207
But we've gone through
a lot of hard times.

464
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:03,650
And believe me when I say that
we are now better than ever.

465
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:08,403
Daughter, be more generous
and more sympathetic to me.

466
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:28,209
The Andalusians are here!
Oh, Antia, how lovely!

467
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:29,407
Hello.

468
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,204
Hello.
Hi dear.

469
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,129
I thought you weren't coming back.

470
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:38,126
We've had enough of travelling!

471
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,165
Do you remember your father?

472
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,084
I come to deliver my soul to God.

473
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,367
What about your mother?

474
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:46,921
Awful... I'll tell you.

475
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:51,242
Come. Chubby!

476
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:01,525
My father was having an affair with
the girl who takes care of my mother.

477
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,210
Your mother knows?

478
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:10,647
My mother is past it,
the poor thing, locked in her room...

479
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:13,167
What's that?

480
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:16,607
A tattoo.

481
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:19,721
AJ?

482
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,242
A for Antia and J for Juliet?

483
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:25,521
Yes.

484
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,050
Easy, it's still tender...

485
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,930
<i>I wonder if you live
on the coast</i>

486
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,244
<i>And if you still like to fish.</i>

487
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:52,410
<i>At age nine, you would go out with
your father on the boat.</i>

488
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:56,084
<i>You wanted to be a fisherman.</i>

489
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:00,764
How can I let you go to camp
like someone from the Adams family?

490
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,086
I want to go like that.

491
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,324
Well, people have to see
that you have a face

492
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:10,730
You have eyes, nose,
mouth, ears... a

493
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,370
Oh Mum, don't talk crap.

494
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:15,683
Oh, Antia, really, you should go on
vacation, you'll have fun.

495
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,445
I don't want to go, I want to stay.

496
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:20,126
Well, a lady can't always
do what a lady wants.

497
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:21,770
What's happening to my child?

498
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:25,443
Dad, I don't want to leave...
Now that I'm on vacation,

499
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,921
I can go fishing
with you every day.

500
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:32,883
Didn't you say you needed help,
now I am older?

501
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,930
Ouch, fisher woman...

502
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:38,209
I promise that when you come back
you will be a sailor again, OK?

503
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,120
I have your word?

504
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:42,807
Come on, sea wolf.

505
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,085
Have fun.

506
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:52,850
You're going already, Antia?

507
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:58,128
Oh, well... You'll come to visit me
in my house when you get back, OK?

508
00:44:58,360 --> 00:44:59,850
Won't you be here?

509
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:03,089
No, honey, I won't be here, but you
promise me you'll come to see me.

510
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:05,089
Come on.

511
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,123
Take care, OK?

512
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,087
Come on, let's go.

513
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:11,765


514
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,131
Why is Marian going?

515
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:25,206
Her husband is sick.
She's going to look after him.

516
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:26,685
Did you fire her?

517
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:29,525
What a thing to say...
Of course not!

518
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:33,410
If you asked her to stay,
she would stay.

519
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,849
Antia, people have
the right to retire.

520
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,445
Hello, Mary.
Hello Julieta.

521
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:00,650
- Are you leaving your backpack?
- No. I'm keeping it with me

522
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,528
Your name?

523
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:11,721
Don't worry.

524
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:13,444
Antia Feijoó.

525
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:16,166
Antia Feijoó... Here it is.

526
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:17,406
I love you.

527
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:21,531
Ah, yes, here.
Anda, you move fast, huh?

528
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:44,081
Do you want me to prepare something
for dinner before I go?

529
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:46,806
No need.
Inés should be arriving.

530
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:49,049
If you can't find anything,
call me at home.

531
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:50,966
Thank you.

532
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:54,001
Well...

533
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:56,361
I'll go then.

534
00:46:58,080 --> 00:46:59,684
Are you wearing Xoan's sweatshirt?

535
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:05,168
Xoan gave it to me long ago.
I don't wear anything that's not mine.

536
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,128
Are you serious about
teaching in a school?

537
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,007
Yes.

538
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:21,091
I think you're wrong.

539
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:23,762
I don't want to be just
a housewife, Marian.

540
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:27,888
I have a job I like and
I want to return to it.

541
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:30,681
The profession of a woman is her family,

542
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,565
And if you want to keep it together,

543
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:35,200
The best you can do is stay home.

544
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:38,130
- That's my business!
- If you go, it will happen as usual.

545
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:39,727
What do you mean?

546
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:44,326
What always happens?

547
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:16,368
- Has Marian gone?
- Yes.

548
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:18,685
The new one will be arriving.

549
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:21,329
I hope she is more discreet.

550
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:23,960
Why do you say that?

551
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:27,325
When I came thirteen years ago,
Marian told me not to wait,

552
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:30,349
And that you were
spending the night with Ava.

553
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:34,321
And now, when she was leaving,
she told me something.

554
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:38,163
When I went to see my parents
with Antia, ten years ago,

555
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:41,628
You came back to spend the nights with Ava.

556
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:52,290
Hi, I'm Ines.

557
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:57,691
Would you mind coming tomorrow?
Marian has  left everything done.

558
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:00,322
Ah, yes, of course.
I'll come tomorrow.

559
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:02,409
Okay, thank you.
I'll see you later.

560
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:03,766
Tomorrow.

561
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:15,241
I've known Ava for 15 years,
we have never been in love,

562
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:17,723
But we fucked occasionally.

563
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:24,047
I thought of telling you many times,
but I didn't know how.

564
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:32,250
I haven't said much,
you may have noticed that.

565
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:35,007
But Antia and you are the
most important things in my life,

566
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:36,931
You know that, right?

567
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:41,365
Aren't you going to say something?

568
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:43,841
No.

569
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:47,525
What are you going to do?

570
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:53,680
I'm going for a walk,
and to prepare lessons.

571
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,289
I think I'll go fishing.

572
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:25,043
<i>Coastal Radio reports
a sudden change of direction</i>

573
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:28,004
<i>And wind speed in the area
of the Ria of Ferrol.</i>

574
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:31,051
<i>This change is
causing rough seas,</i>

575
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:33,521
<i>With waves of six to eight meters high.</i>

576
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:37,202
<i>Cessation of any fishing activity
and navigation is recommended</i>

577
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:39,363
<i>That can be done in the area</i>

578
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:42,364
<i>With the express
recommendation to all vessels</i>

579
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:44,761
<i>To return to their respective
ports mooring.</i>

<i>The launch was made to the three...</i> .

585
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:22,161
<i>Yes</i>

586
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:24,966
Ava, sorry to call you

587
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:27,922
I just wanted to know if Xoan is with you

588
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:29,725
Xoan? No.

589
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:33,890
<i>Do you have any idea where he might be</i>

590
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:36,046
He hasn't returned

591
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:37,841
No.

592
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:39,411
Well, he will have gone fishing.

593
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:43,922
Well, I hope not...
because there's been a storm warning.

594
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:47,410
Wait, they're saying something...
<i>... shipwreck of a gabela,</i>

595
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:50,609
<i>Three miles north of the
mouth of the Ria of Ferrol.</i>

00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:56,444
<i>Its occupant has not yet been located and
there are serious fears for his life.</i>

597
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:59,444
<i>Similarly, there is a pleasure boat</i>

598
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:00,931
<i>With three crew.</i>

600

<i>Civil Protection from being able to help.</i>

601
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:10,321
<i>As dawn comes and sea
conditions improve...</i>

602
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:50,605
I am the judge Vicente Louro.

603
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:53,804
In order to move the body,
you need to identify it.

604
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:06,324
I must warn you.

605
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:11,086
Because of the violence of the storm,
his body has been damaged.

606
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,126
I'll get it.

607
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,206
It's Antia.

608
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:40,206
Antía?

609
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:43,163
From the camp and
she wants to talk to you.

610
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:45,968
Come, Julieta,
you have to talk to her.

611
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:53,647
Antia...

612
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:57,089
Mom, it's me...
What's wrong with your phone?

613
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:59,248
I've called so many times
and you don't answer.

614
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:03,407
I don't know... I didn't hear.

615
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:07,086
- How are you, darling?
- Good.

616
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:10,323
Tomorrow Ava and I will get you.

617
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:13,128
We'll be early so we won't
keep you waiting.

618
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:14,401
No need, Mum.

619
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:18,089
I'm with my friend Bea,
that I met here.

620
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:19,885
We're best friends.

621
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:24,087
Can I go to spend a week
with them to Madrid?

622
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:25,565
You don't mind, do you?

623
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:28,367
But...I don't know them...

624
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:30,849
She's my friend, mum.
Let me.

625
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:34,203
Well, look, you can talk to her
mother and she can tell you.

626
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:38,646
Hello. How are you?
I'm Claudia, Beatrice's mother.

627
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:40,366
How's my daughter?

628
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:42,403
Well, terrific.
I didn't know her before,

629
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:45,564
But I think the camp
has been wonderful.

630
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:49,600
Look, I wanted to ask permission
to take her with us to Madrid.

631
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:53,885
Antia and my daughter have become close
and are both very persistent.

632
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:56,008
Doesn't the camp finish tomorrow?

633
00:56:56,560 --> 00:57:00,565
Yes, yes... I have arrived early
and, well...

634
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:02,762
Because I wanted them out this afternoon.

635
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:05,087
<i>What do you think?
Well...</i>

636
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:09,451
If it's no trouble...

637
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:34,730
Julieta... How are you? I'm Claudia.
Come in, come, please.

638
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:37,647
I'm so sorry, really.

639
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:42,242
How was the trip?
Come in.

640
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:49,002
The girls are playing in another room.
I haven't told them anything.

641
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:52,330
Does Antia think it's unusual
to come for her today?

642
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:54,966
She's angry because she thinks
you're coming to take her,

643
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:58,801
And she has called Xoan,
but he hasn't responded, of course.

644
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:00,841
Where can I talk to her?

645
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:04,244
I think there would
be more comfortable.

646
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:07,281
Do you want a drink?
Something to eat?

647
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:10,007
I don't know...

648
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,685
Well, then, come through...

649
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:15,966
I'll get her.

650
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:30,847
Hi, Mum.

651
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:33,161
Hi, honey.

652
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:34,841
How are you?

653
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:39,561
Sit down.

654
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:44,208
Hey, I told you to leave me
for a few more days!

655
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:48,406
Don't make that face,
we're on vacation!

656
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:52,368
How's Dad?
He hasn't answered me...

657
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:55,649
Antia, I have to tell you something.

658
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:57,247
Tell me.

659
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:01,601
After two days of leave,
there was a storm...

660
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:07,170
Papa's ship and two boats disappeared...

661
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:09,525
No one was saved.

662
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:11,681
What about Dad?

663
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:14,200
Dad neither.

664
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:16,571
Dad died?

665
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:19,161
Yes...

666
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:28,646
Antía.

667
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:43,771
But... why did he go fishing
if there was a storm?

668
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:50,242
The storm came in the afternoon and
your father left in the morning.

669
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:56,561
I am sorry to tell you this,
but my husband and I

670
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:58,728
We have organized a
trip to Patagonia

671
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:00,922
Now Bea doesn't want
to come with us,

672
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:03,441
She wants to be with Antia,
here at home.

673
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:04,681
Really?

674
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:06,928
- Obviously, they can't stay alone...
- No.

675
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:11,125
And I thought, you could stay here with them.
The baby is coming with us.

676
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:13,209
- Here?
- The two girls and you.

677
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:16,410
After what happened to you,
it might be a good rest.

678
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:18,562
And Antia is more distracted in Madrid.

679
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:21,684
- Well...
- Rosa takes care of everything.

680
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:26,165
You can go for a walk,
go to the movies, relax...

681
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:27,731
Well, I didn't bring any clothes.

682
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:30,521
But you can use mine!
I have everything.

683
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:33,291
Dresses, loose shirts
that don't fit me

684
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:36,847
They'll fit you better than me.
You can try on whatever you want.

685
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:14,767
Watch out! Eh!
One, two...

686
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:16,166
Come on, let's go.

687
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:25,885
<i>Things were happening
without my participation,</i>

688
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:28,928
<i>You were preoccupied with each other.</i>

689
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:52,925
- Good morning.
- Hello.

690
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:55,128
We've come to see the
flat for rent.

691
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:57,004
Just a moment.

692
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:00,886
Follow me.

693
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:12,886
The kitchen.

694
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:21,926
- The wallpaper is a bit much.
- No, the wallpaper is cool.

695
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:24,049
If we get tired of it, we can paint it.

696
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:28,011
We are also very close by.

697
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:32,042
<i>Bea and you found an
apartment near where she lived.</i>

698
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:35,682
<i>I rented it for you.</i>

699
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:38,447
<i>But I couldn't with my heart and soul,</i>

700
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:41,961
<i>But you were as strong as an oak.</i>

701
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:44,729
<i>You had matured...</i>

702
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:54,809
<i>You went back and met with Ava,
to put the house up for sale.</i>

703
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:59,168
<i>In Madrid, Bea took care of me.</i>

704
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:02,641
<i>We just survived without you.</i>

705
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:06,683
<i>On your return
we didn't talk much.</i>

706
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:11,084
<i>You didn't want me to be sad and I...</i>

707
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:13,524
<i>Was beyond caring.</i>

708
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:16,522
Come on, Mum. Let's go.

709
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:19,450
We're going to stand up.
Bea, come and help me.

710
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:22,610
<i>I'll...</i>
Put this here.

711
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:27,085
There... Don't slip.
Put the towel on, come on.

712
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:31,321
Okay, uh...
Get me that big towel.

713
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:34,728
- This one?
- Yes.

714
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:37,165
Cover her back.

715
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:44,641
Careful.

716
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:51,531
Rub her back well,

717
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:53,763
I don't want her to get cold.

718
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:14,281
Now we'll finish with the dryer.

719
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:23,769
Hi, Mom.
Hello.

720
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:27,530
If you want to eat together,
we'll have to hurry,

721
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:29,962
I'm going to study with Bea.

722
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:31,850
Do you like it?

723
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:33,081
Yes.

724
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:35,322
I think I'll paint the lounge
in the morning.

725
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:38,922
No need, Mom. I'm already
used to the wallpaper.

726
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:40,731
And Bea loves it.

727
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:43,844
Well, Bea has a beautiful house,
vanilla coloured,

728
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:47,681
And doesn't have to live here.
Do you want me to make you a sandwich?

729
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:50,400
OK, but prisita date.

730
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:52,324
<i>I beat depression with your help</i>

731
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:55,171
<i>And I found a job I
could do at home:</i>

732
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:57,762
<i>Correcting proofs.</i>

733
01:04:58,680 --> 01:05:03,004
<i>The rest of the time was devoted to you.
I didn't need anything else.</i>

734
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:10,288
<i>Four years later, when Bea
went to the United States</i>

735
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:13,291
<i>You chose to go to a spiritual
retreat in the Pyrenees.</i>

736
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:16,441
<i>A retreat that would last three months</i>

737
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:19,761
<i>Until you returned
to start college.</i>

738
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:23,169
<i>I dreaded you leaving,</i>

739
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:26,326
<i>But you had been out very little
in recent years,</i>

740
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:29,451
<i>Always aware of me
and your studies.</i>

741
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:33,365
<i>I had no right to deny you.
In addition...</i>

742
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:35,887
<i>You were of legal age.</i>

743
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:38,687
Yes?

744
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:40,247
Yes, I am.

745
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:42,646
It's here now.

746
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:48,202
The taxi. It's down below.

747
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:54,128
- Are you taking that?
- Yes.

748
01:05:57,320 --> 01:05:59,641
Stop, Mum. I can do it.

749
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:08,166
Well, take care and have fun.

750
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:11,044
You take care too, Mum.

751
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:15,131
And don't worry if I don't
call or write you soon.

752
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:17,809
Are you going to be incommunicado?

753
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:21,360
Mum, it's a retreat.
The important thing is to disconnect.

754
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:23,166
What if I get ill?

755
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:25,204
Don't blackmail me, please!

756
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:30,408
Of course not, honey. I have work and
I need to get my notes in order.

757
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:32,604
Maybe I'll put them in a book.

758
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:34,725
I'll be busy.

759
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:36,611
That's good.

760
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:43,083
Let me walk you to the station.

761
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:46,562
Remember that you
don't like goodbyes.

762
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:54,402
Well, goodbye.

763
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:06,649
- Hello.
- Hello.

764
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:10,048
I'm the mother of Antia Feijoo.
I've come to get her today.

765
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:12,126
Follow me.

766
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:22,966
Julieta Arcos?
Yes.

767
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:26,202
I am the mother of Antia.
I am Juana.

768
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:29,083
What an amazing place!

769
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:32,884
I've asked Liliana to
bring us some tea out here.

770
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:38,010
Does Antia know I'm here?

771
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:40,762
- Yes...
- I can't wait to see her.

772
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:44,246
These three months without her
have been so long...

773
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:45,521
Sure...

774
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:47,848
I understand that you
have your reasons, but...

775
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:51,089
Isolation during this time
has been so hard.

776
01:08:56,320 --> 01:08:58,129
Are you going to make me wait long?

777
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:04,323
Julieta, the point is
that Antia is not here.

778
01:09:05,320 --> 01:09:06,606
Isn't this the place?

779
01:09:07,320 --> 01:09:09,766
- I followed the directions on the map.
- This is the place.

780
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:12,121
When Antia wrote she thought
she would be here,

781
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:14,529
But ultimately she decided to leave.

782
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:17,450
She could have warned me.
I've driven from Madrid...

783
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:18,681
I know.

784
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:20,891
And where has she gone?

785
01:09:21,880 --> 01:09:22,961
I hope it's nearby.

786
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:25,051
I can't tell you.

787
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:26,721
What?

788
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:30,123
I can't tell you where she is.
I'm sorry.

789
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:34,128
Don't you know?
You are responsible.

790
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:36,846
Of course I know. But Antia
asked me not to tell.

791
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:39,828
Are you saying that my daughter
doesn't want to see me?

792
01:09:41,560 --> 01:09:43,171
Look, Julieta.

793
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:49,210
Antia has chosen her own path
and you are not part of it.

794
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:52,841
I understand that for a mother,
that must be very painful,

795
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:54,804
But she wants you to accept it.

796
01:09:56,360 --> 01:09:58,362
I think I'll call the police.

797
01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:02,286
Do what you want.

798
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:05,722
It's best to start accepting reality.

799
01:10:06,360 --> 01:10:08,124
I understand that's not easy...

800
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:10,828
What have you done to my daughter
in three months?

801
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:12,285
We've helped her, Julieta.

802
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:15,131
Your daughter arrived in a
state of extreme need.

803
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:18,728
Need for what?
My daughter has never lacked for anything!

804
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:22,767
However, she was
lonely and miserable.

805
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:28,348
Your daughter discovered here
that her life lacked a spiritual dimension

806
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:31,321
What do you mean?

807
01:10:31,680 --> 01:10:36,310
I understand that she was not raised in a
home based on faith... she found it here.

808
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:40,610
Let her tell me herself!
Where is she?

809
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:42,931
I can't tell you.

810
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:47,289
What is important is that Antia is now
better than ever and is very happy.

811
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:50,205
If you stop thinking about yourself for a moment
and think about your daughter,

812
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:54,120
- You should be happy.
- You can't tell me that!

813
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:59,248
Don't despair, she may
decide to contact you,

814
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:01,589
But give it time.

815
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:10,927
<i>I reported your disappearance
to the police,</i>

816
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:12,805
<i>I hired a private detective...</i>

817
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:15,886
<i>For the first months,
I did nothing else</i>

818
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,968
<i>but try to find you, by any means.</i>

819
01:11:18,920 --> 01:11:21,651
<i>The only thing I discovered was
how little I knew about you...</i>

820
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:39,564
- Julieta Arcos?
- Yes, that's me.

821
01:11:39,680 --> 01:11:41,045
I have a letter.

822
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:46,244
Sign here please?

823
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:49,086
Thank you.

824
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:54,766
Antia.

825
01:12:22,160 --> 01:12:23,161
Hello, Papa.

826
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:26,504
Hello, Julieta.
Did you get the card I sent?

827
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:28,244
Yes. I'm looking at it.

828
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:30,880
- See how handsome your brother is!
- Yes.

829
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:32,726
He's very handsome.

830
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:34,444
When will you come to meet him?

831
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,970
I can't now, Papa.
I told you I'm very busy...

832
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:42,282
I'm sorry, but I have to go.
You call me, OK?

833
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:44,165
<i>Don't keep punishing me, Julieta.</i>

834
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:46,926
Don't I have the right to be happy
after the death of your mother?

835
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:48,850
I'd rather not talk about that.

836
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:51,691
Remember you are still my daughter
and Antia is my granddaughter.

837
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:54,811
<i>The last time I saw her
she was still a child...</i>

838
01:12:55,640 --> 01:12:57,642
Give her kisses when you see her.

839
01:12:57,960 --> 01:12:59,200
I will.

840
01:13:00,280 --> 01:13:02,044
Kisses for you too.

841
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:22,081
<i>For the first three years,
I bought a cake on your birthday.</i>

842
01:13:24,040 --> 01:13:27,408
<i>I was consoled by the idea of celebrating
the arrival of your card</i>

843
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:30,366
<i>And at least seeing your
name in the address.</i>

844
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:35,206
<i>I didn't expect more.
But it was expecting too much.</i>

845
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:41,405
<i>The first three years,
I threw your cake in the dustbin</i>

846
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:44,962
<i>To celebrate your birthday,
I made it a tradition.</i>

847
01:14:32,280 --> 01:14:36,080
Inocencio, I'm leaving the flat.
I'm leaving Spain.

848
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:38,244
And... and when?

849
01:14:38,360 --> 01:14:41,921
Soon. Within a week... Sorry.

850
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:46,124
Inocencio, I'm sorry about
the noise last night...

851
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:48,370
The tenant below you complained.

852
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:52,169
You no longer have to put up with it.
Bye.

853
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:01,871
<i>I looked for a Madrid neighborhood
that I had never set foot in.</i>

854
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:05,004
<i>I wanted to live in a place where
there were none of your fingerprints,</i>

855
01:15:05,240 --> 01:15:06,924
<i>Nothing reminded me of you.</i>

856
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:47,929
Hi, honey.
Hello.

857
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:49,531
No, don't get up...

858
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:52,209
- No, no...
- Yes, I can get up...

859
01:15:52,520 --> 01:15:53,601
How are you, love?

860
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:55,281
Well...

861
01:15:56,520 --> 01:16:00,286
The latest outbreak has left me
entirely paralyzed on my left side, but...

862
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:03,090
What about your new home?

863
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:08,329
Better.
It's as if I lived in another city.

864
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:11,561
They are beautiful!

865
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:15,603
I have a gift for you too.

866
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:17,366
It's there, in the bag.

867
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:24,760
The man sitting...

868
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:31,451
Thank you, Ava.

869
01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:37,160
Before you go, I would like
to tell you something.

870
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:41,122
- It doesn't really explain anything, but...
- No need.

871
01:16:41,720 --> 01:16:44,400
It's been fine between us for ages.

872
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:46,687
 It's about Antia...

873
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:57,061
When we went to your house to pack up,
Marian arrived...

874
01:17:04,240 --> 01:17:05,671
Antía, my child!

875
01:17:08,280 --> 01:17:11,927
<i>I couldn't stop her seeing
Antía and talking to her.</i>

876
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:15,849
She told her all the details
of Xoan's last day.

877
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:18,603
Your argument and...

878
01:17:19,320 --> 01:17:23,327
..how Xoan went to sea,
even though the sea was rough that day.

879
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:28,164
But Marian wasn't there,
she had already gone by eleven!

880
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:31,883
Apparently Xoan called her
to find out what you had said...

881
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:35,682
Antia didn't say anything,

882
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:38,329
She never asked me anything.

883
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:40,505
She asked me.

884
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:45,646
She wanted to confirm whether
you had argued about me,

885
01:17:46,240 --> 01:17:48,508
And if it was true that
the sea was rough.

886
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:50,968
I had no idea about
the state of the sea.

887
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:54,869
I told her that the rest was
not appropriate to discuss with a child.

888
01:17:55,680 --> 01:17:59,905
She got really angry, insulted me,
said I was a whore...

889
01:18:01,160 --> 01:18:05,381
She blamed you and me
for Xoan going out fishing.

890
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:08,770
I don't understand.

891
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:12,527
She never made the slightest reproach.

892
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:19,645
We didn't talk much, that's true,

893
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:24,681
But adolescent girls
are mysterious...

894
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:28,429
And I didn't want to overwhelm her.

895
01:18:30,440 --> 01:18:31,521


896
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:42,408
The day she went traveling,
Antia called me.

897
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:44,525
Hello, Ava. How are you?

898
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,262
<i>Antia! Good, OK.</i>

899
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:51,429
<i>They have given me the diagnosis.
It's multiple sclerosis.</i>

900
01:18:51,640 --> 01:18:54,086
<i>But don't tell your mother,
I'll call her.</i>

901
01:18:54,280 --> 01:18:59,605
Ava, I would like to talk to you
but I don't know if it's the right time.

902
01:19:00,280 --> 01:19:02,323
She asked me the same questions.

903
01:19:03,560 --> 01:19:08,043
She only changed one thing:
she laid the blame with three people.

904
01:19:09,160 --> 01:19:10,685
She included herself.

905
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:13,245
Why was it her fault?

906
01:19:13,960 --> 01:19:17,123
Her absence and having
been happy at the camp.

907
01:19:20,280 --> 01:19:23,124
I said I felt no guilt
for what I did.

908
01:19:24,520 --> 01:19:28,809
And, if we were guilty, we had
suffered enough punishment.

909
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,128
Then Antia told me...

910
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:36,689
Each of us got what she deserves.

911
01:19:43,640 --> 01:19:46,664
<i>You were brought up with the same freedom
as my parents raised me.</i>

912
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:52,484
<i>When we moved to Madrid and I was
in that depression, you didn't say anything,</i>

913
01:19:52,840 --> 01:19:55,320
<i>But I stifled a
tremendous sense of guilt</i>

914
01:19:55,440 --> 01:19:57,886
<i>For the death of your
father and the man in the train.</i>

915
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:03,369
<i>I always avoided talking about it,
I wanted you to grow up guiltless.</i>

916
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:06,609
<i>But you perceived it...</i>

917
01:20:08,240 --> 01:20:09,651
<i>And despite my silence,</i>

918
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:12,127
<i>I ended up infecting you
as if it were a virus.</i>

919
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:24,403
She asked to be sedated.

920
01:20:26,520 --> 01:20:28,682
The reality was very hard.

921
01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:30,683
- Sorry, Lorenzo Gentile.

922
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:32,081


923
01:20:33,560 --> 01:20:35,688
- We met in the elevator
in the hospital.

924
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:38,162
- See you later.
Bye.

925
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:45,848
- I thought to myself:
why is this woman so beautiful and so sad.

926
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:49,529
Surely you must have come to visit
someone who was very serious.

927
01:20:49,640 --> 01:20:51,849
I figured it was not
our beloved Ava.

928
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:57,570
To Ava...

929
01:21:05,720 --> 01:21:06,881
Ava talked about you.

930
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:08,406
What did she say?

931
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:11,249
I have a friend
you have to meet.

932
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:17,808
<i>Ava left me an inheritance of Lorenzo.
I never told you.</i>

933
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:22,849
<i>There was not a single mark of yours
in the house, you didn't exist.</i>

934
01:21:24,160 --> 01:21:26,128
<i>I started a new life with him.</i>

935
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:31,171
<i>The days turned into weeks and
weeks into months and years...</i>

936
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:34,409
<i>There were days I didn't think about you.</i>

937
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:45,729
<i>When a former drug addict,
who is clean for many years,</i>

938
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:49,402
<i>Slips up once, relapse is fatal.</i>

939
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:53,402
<i>I refrained from you for years,</i>

940
01:21:54,160 --> 01:21:57,767
<i>But I made a mistake,
lying about the hope of finding you</i>

941
01:21:57,920 --> 01:21:59,251
<i>knowing about you.</i>

942
01:22:01,160 --> 01:22:04,164
<i>That absurd hope has
devoured the weak base</i>

943
01:22:04,280 --> 01:22:06,881
<i>On which I had
built my new life.</i>

944
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,825
<i>Now I have nothing left.</i>

945
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:13,770
<i>Only you exist.</i>

946
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:18,109
<i>Your absence fills my life
completely and destroys it.</i>

947
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:45,447
Come on. here here!

948
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:47,782
This way!

949
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:01,124
- No.
- Here, give it.

950
01:23:26,640 --> 01:23:27,641
Julieta?

951
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:29,926
Julieta!

952
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:34,130
Julieta, it's me, Bea.

953
01:23:36,240 --> 01:23:37,401
Beatriz ...

954
01:23:38,440 --> 01:23:39,965
Is it really you?

955
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:43,848
Sure.
Are you okay, Julieta?

956
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:47,647
<i>Come on...</i>

957
01:23:48,160 --> 01:23:49,924
You seemed well
when I saw you...

958
01:23:51,160 --> 01:23:53,970
These two girls have reminded
me of you and Antia.

959
01:23:56,600 --> 01:24:00,082
They are my nieces.
What happened to you?

960
01:24:01,160 --> 01:24:03,322
The last time you were so good!

961
01:24:09,320 --> 01:24:11,322
When we met,
I didn't say anything,

962
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:15,843
But I haven't seen Antia, or heard
anything about her for twelve years.

963
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:18,406
Twelve years?

964
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:24,111
Did you really find her like you said?

965
01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:30,728
Yes, I met her. And it was very
unpleasant, but I didn't want to say.

966
01:24:31,680 --> 01:24:34,160
Unpleasant? Why?

967
01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:38,886
Antia didn't want to talk to me,
she did her best to avoid me.

968
01:24:39,560 --> 01:24:43,442
She said he didn't know me,
that I had mistaken her for someone else.

969
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:46,010
But I knew it was her.

970
01:24:46,520 --> 01:24:48,807
In the end she had no
choice but to talk to me.

971
01:24:49,240 --> 01:24:51,083
And what about the children, is that true?

972
01:24:51,680 --> 01:24:54,763
Yes, three. When I saw her,
she was with two of them.

973
01:24:55,080 --> 01:24:56,969
But why didn't she
want to talk to you?

974
01:24:57,400 --> 01:24:58,686
You were her best friend!

975
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:01,683
We were more than that, Julieta.

976
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:05,324
After the camp we became inseparable.
Don't you remember?

977
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:10,043
Yes, of course.
You were always together.

978
01:25:10,280 --> 01:25:12,442
We couldn't live without each other!

979
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:15,543
Too bad that in the end it was hell...

980
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:18,286
Hell?

981
01:25:19,320 --> 01:25:20,751
I can see you know nothing.

982
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:24,001
No, I know nothing.

983
01:25:25,280 --> 01:25:28,568
I went to study Design in New York
to get away from your daughter.

984
01:25:28,840 --> 01:25:30,171
Then one day I called Antia..

985
01:25:30,280 --> 01:25:32,931
And she told me she was going
to a retreat to the Pyrenees.

986
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:35,851
It seemed fine to me
as she would leave me alone.

987
01:25:36,160 --> 01:25:38,811
You spoke to her again?
You were in contact?

988
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:40,850
Well, I called once,

989
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:43,440
But she wasn't the person I knew.

990
01:25:45,200 --> 01:25:46,690
What do you mean?

991
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:50,001
She told me she was ashamed
of our relationship

992
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:52,689
And she wanted to know nothing about me.

993
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:57,161
That she was a new person,
who had finally found her way

994
01:25:57,280 --> 01:25:59,282
And I was no longer part of it.

995
01:26:01,800 --> 01:26:05,825
She spoke like a fanatic, Julieta.
I was scared.

996
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:33,881
Careful!

997
01:26:37,160 --> 01:26:38,400
Call an ambulance.

998
01:26:56,320 --> 01:26:57,742
Lorenzo?

999
01:26:58,720 --> 01:27:00,001
How are you?

1000
01:27:00,360 --> 01:27:02,085
I have dry mouth.

1001
01:27:04,360 --> 01:27:05,441
Let's see...

1002
01:27:10,040 --> 01:27:14,470
What a coincidence that you
were there when the accident happened!

1003
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:18,327
I came back from Portugal four days ago

1004
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:22,171
I went to your house to see if
I was lucky and I looked around.

1005
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:25,041
But I changed my house, Lorenzo.

1006
01:27:25,680 --> 01:27:26,927
I no longer live there.

1007
01:27:27,280 --> 01:27:28,327
Yes, I know.

1008
01:27:28,440 --> 01:27:30,324
And how did you find out?

1009
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:34,685
For the first few days I followed
you to see what you were doing.

1010
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:36,746
You followed me?

1011
01:27:38,720 --> 01:27:41,371
I was more obsessed than you knew.

1012
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:47,411
When I realized I was turning
into one of those...

1013
01:27:48,040 --> 01:27:51,044
Obsessive characters
of Patricia Highsmith,

1014
01:27:51,160 --> 01:27:53,686
Hiding around corners or...

1015
01:27:54,520 --> 01:27:56,887
Standing guard
around your house,

1016
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:02,765
I stopped following you and I
went to Portugal to write.

1017
01:28:05,200 --> 01:28:06,770
I returned a few days ago.

1018
01:28:11,960 --> 01:28:14,770
Sorry I was so awful to you, Lorenzo.

1019
01:29:55,960 --> 01:29:57,161
Did you read these?

1020
01:29:57,320 --> 01:30:00,847
No! I haven't had time,
nor did I dare.

1021
01:30:01,400 --> 01:30:03,971
Read them if you want,
and then destroy them.

1022
01:30:41,880 --> 01:30:43,120
Dear Mum,

1023
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:47,049
I don't know if you live in Madrid
and if you live in the same house

1024
01:30:47,880 --> 01:30:50,201
But I have no other address to write to.

1025
01:30:51,680 --> 01:30:53,091
I have three children.

1026
01:30:54,440 --> 01:30:57,046
Xoan, the eldest,

1027
01:30:57,520 --> 01:31:01,286
At only nine years old,
he drowned in a river.

1028
01:31:02,160 --> 01:31:04,003
And I'm crazy with grief.

1029
01:31:06,520 --> 01:31:07,965
Right now

1030
01:31:08,920 --> 01:31:10,922
The worst of my life,

1031
01:31:12,200 --> 01:31:13,440
I think of you.

1032
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:18,004
Now I understand what you have suffered
because of my disappearance...

1033
01:31:19,640 --> 01:31:21,324
I couldn't imagine.

1034
01:31:22,360 --> 01:31:25,091
No one who has not
suffered this can imagine it.

1035
01:31:28,200 --> 01:31:30,248
I won't ask for any explanation.

1036
01:31:33,400 --> 01:31:35,265
I just want to be with her.

1037
01:31:37,080 --> 01:31:38,950
But she hasn't invited me to her...

1038
01:31:40,200 --> 01:31:44,491
After thirteen years she wouldn't dare, 
but she has given you the return address.
