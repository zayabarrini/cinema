1
00:02:34,647 --> 00:02:36,670
Today, the art of killing.

2
00:02:37,547 --> 00:02:41,536
If you've fought the bull well,
you must kill it well.

3
00:02:42,047 --> 00:02:44,979
If not, it's a tragedy for both.

4
00:02:45,413 --> 00:02:48,141
The matador doesn't live up to his name

5
00:02:48,513 --> 00:02:51,445
and the bull's bravery is betrayed.

6
00:02:52,914 --> 00:02:58,505
<i>The matador first examines the bull
from a distance to decide what to do</i>

7
00:02:59,114 --> 00:03:01,773
<i>and to see which horn the bull favors.</i>

8
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:06,139
<i>A good kill comes after good passes
with a cape,</i>

9
00:03:06,213 --> 00:03:11,236
when the bull stops charging
and asks for death.

10
00:03:11,814 --> 00:03:13,712
He shows us his death.

11
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:17,940
<i>The sword must stab him behind the head</i>

12
00:03:18,014 --> 00:03:20,775
<i>in the cross between his shoulders.</i>

13
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:25,912
We call this point "the needle's eye."

14
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:30,803
<i>It can't be crooked, it must go straight</i>

15
00:03:30,914 --> 00:03:33,141
to the heart and lungs.

16
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:38,008
There are three ways to enter into the kill.

17
00:03:38,647 --> 00:03:40,636
<i>The first is "receiving."</i>

18
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:47,438
To kill, the sword must be an extension
of the arm, which is bent 90 degrees.

19
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:50,769
The hand should be at heart level.

20
00:03:51,513 --> 00:03:56,502
<i>We must stab him at the cross
or fall prey to the devil.</i>

21
00:03:59,047 --> 00:04:04,240
<i>We move the cape towards his face
and goad him towards us.</i>

22
00:04:04,547 --> 00:04:06,877
<i>Always watching his snout,</i>

23
00:04:07,246 --> 00:04:10,008
<i>we sink the sword into the cross.</i>

24
00:04:10,747 --> 00:04:12,303
But that's not enough.

25
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:16,779
<i>To kill a bull like he deserves,
he must be killed</i>

26
00:04:17,246 --> 00:04:20,178
not just with the sword, but with the heart.

27
00:04:22,346 --> 00:04:25,107
- And you?
- I'm not wearing clothes.

28
00:06:31,246 --> 00:06:32,610
Very good today.

29
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,509
We want a chance.

30
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:37,068
- We want to fight bulls.
- So do I.

31
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:38,941
It's not my fault you're lame.

32
00:06:39,013 --> 00:06:41,309
<i>- We'll talk later.
- Maestro.</i>

33
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:44,574
We're throwing a really wild party tonight.

34
00:06:45,046 --> 00:06:47,444
- Will you come?
- Not tonight.

35
00:06:48,013 --> 00:06:49,445
You're such a drag!

36
00:06:49,513 --> 00:06:51,342
They're wild tonight.

37
00:06:51,946 --> 00:06:54,469
You have to help me pick up girls.

38
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:59,070
- You can't do it alone?
- I've never done it.

39
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,168
- You've never been with a girl?
- Never.

40
00:07:03,647 --> 00:07:05,738
Treat a woman like a bull.

41
00:07:05,814 --> 00:07:08,904
Let her know who's boss.

42
00:07:11,747 --> 00:07:14,304
- Give me that.
- Don't...

43
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:16,608
That's my lunch!

44
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,339
It's an amanita.

45
00:07:18,413 --> 00:07:21,743
- What's wrong?
- It's very poisonous.

46
00:07:21,814 --> 00:07:23,780
- How do you know?
- Look.

47
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:27,303
The color of the cap and the stalk.

48
00:07:28,814 --> 00:07:31,746
Throw them away, they're dangerous.

49
00:07:33,547 --> 00:07:37,172
You got dizzy when I talked about women.

50
00:07:37,246 --> 00:07:38,939
You're still pale.

51
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:42,671
No, clouds give me vertigo, you know?

52
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,773
Can I have some water for a pill?

53
00:07:47,847 --> 00:07:50,005
Sure, of course.

54
00:07:51,547 --> 00:07:53,445
Pills don't take away fear.

55
00:07:53,513 --> 00:07:56,967
I'm not afraid of death. Not of mine.

56
00:07:57,413 --> 00:08:00,470
Fear is normal, it gives you courage.

57
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:06,138
- Did you feel afraid?
- Yes, it's part of the game.

58
00:08:06,447 --> 00:08:08,037
Don't fear fear.

59
00:08:12,413 --> 00:08:13,538
Your girlfriend?

60
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,872
Ava Gardner. You don't see movies?

61
00:08:16,946 --> 00:08:19,674
No, my family's very religious.

62
00:08:20,714 --> 00:08:23,578
I've spent my life praying and exercising.

63
00:08:24,246 --> 00:08:25,735
I recognize her.

64
00:08:25,814 --> 00:08:26,972
Really?

65
00:08:27,046 --> 00:08:28,740
She's my neighbor.

66
00:08:29,547 --> 00:08:30,978
You like her?

67
00:08:31,046 --> 00:08:32,740
She's very pretty.

68
00:08:33,146 --> 00:08:35,578
But those models are so stuck-up.

69
00:08:40,046 --> 00:08:41,672
Eva's different.

70
00:08:41,946 --> 00:08:44,504
- You know her?
- She is my girlfriend.

71
00:08:45,613 --> 00:08:47,374
What a coincidence.

72
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:51,471
- How about a game of pool?
- Okay.

73
00:08:58,613 --> 00:09:01,078
You do well with women, don't you?

74
00:09:01,714 --> 00:09:04,111
Being an ex-matador excites them.

75
00:09:05,513 --> 00:09:09,275
Why do you want to be a matador?
You're not like the others.

76
00:09:11,313 --> 00:09:13,904
Well, I don't know.

77
00:09:16,346 --> 00:09:18,244
I guess I like danger.

78
00:09:19,913 --> 00:09:22,175
And if I have to die,

79
00:09:22,246 --> 00:09:25,905
dying in the bullring is much more exciting.

80
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:29,075
Isn't it?

81
00:09:29,413 --> 00:09:31,743
You're too young to think about that.

82
00:09:31,813 --> 00:09:33,712
What does that matter?

83
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,905
You should think of killing,

84
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,168
not of dying.

85
00:09:43,113 --> 00:09:44,477
Your turn.

86
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,809
I don't know how to play.

87
00:09:51,613 --> 00:09:55,045
I promised my mom I'd go home and study.

88
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:57,743
Angel,

89
00:09:57,813 --> 00:09:59,712
- I'm just curious.
- Yes?

90
00:09:59,779 --> 00:10:01,405
Do you like guys?

91
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,736
No.

92
00:10:06,013 --> 00:10:07,639
Why did you ask?

93
00:10:08,913 --> 00:10:12,471
Most kids your age have been with a girl.

94
00:10:13,547 --> 00:10:17,411
My age! My age!
Why does everyone treat me like an idiot?

95
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,877
- Sorry I asked.
- I'll show you I'm no fag!

96
00:10:20,946 --> 00:10:23,912
- You don't have to show me anything.
- I will!

97
00:10:25,346 --> 00:10:26,573
Angel.

98
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,473
Angel!

99
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,041
What are you doing?

100
00:11:05,979 --> 00:11:08,502
I told you not to lock yourself in!

101
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,203
Hi.

102
00:11:14,213 --> 00:11:16,111
Where are you going?

103
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:18,169
To get some air.

104
00:11:18,447 --> 00:11:20,072
Open your window.

105
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:22,174
I'll be right back.

106
00:11:22,246 --> 00:11:24,837
Dinner's in an hour. Don't be late.

107
00:11:47,246 --> 00:11:49,303
<i>Treat a woman like a bull.</i>

108
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:52,169
<i>Let her know who's boss.</i>

109
00:12:05,213 --> 00:12:07,644
What are you doing? Let go of me!

110
00:12:51,413 --> 00:12:52,673
You pig!

111
00:13:21,313 --> 00:13:22,676
I'm sorry.

112
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,836
Son of a bitch!

113
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:21,736
Come on, take your shower!

114
00:14:24,013 --> 00:14:26,104
Hurry up.

115
00:14:26,946 --> 00:14:28,139
Right.

116
00:14:30,146 --> 00:14:32,237
Stop looking in the mirror.

117
00:14:55,013 --> 00:14:57,377
I go through too many pantyhose.

118
00:15:11,846 --> 00:15:16,336
Lord, bless the noodle soup,
the filet of sole and...

119
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:19,005
- And?
- Custard.

120
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:23,808
And the custard
we receive through Christ our Lord.

121
00:15:26,813 --> 00:15:28,506
You're a disaster.

122
00:15:29,746 --> 00:15:32,803
Falling down! Did anyone see you?

123
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,745
I don't know.

124
00:15:40,113 --> 00:15:41,601
By the way,

125
00:15:42,713 --> 00:15:45,145
when will you see the priest?

126
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:48,969
I don't know.

127
00:15:49,046 --> 00:15:52,500
That was a condition for living here again.

128
00:15:53,113 --> 00:15:54,408
Remember?

129
00:15:57,246 --> 00:15:58,734
Why the wait?

130
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,768
Two months without going to church!

131
00:16:08,713 --> 00:16:13,146
This isn't a hotel. There are rules here.

132
00:16:13,946 --> 00:16:18,038
I won't pay for a life of luxury
and dissipation.

133
00:16:18,946 --> 00:16:22,503
If you can't be pious,
I don't want to see you.

134
00:16:23,046 --> 00:16:24,205
No.

135
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,905
I don't mind being alone

136
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,978
because I'm not alone.

137
00:16:32,113 --> 00:16:33,976
What? Do I bore you?

138
00:16:34,746 --> 00:16:36,712
No, I was just thinking.

139
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:38,977
About what?

140
00:16:39,946 --> 00:16:41,605
Nothing. About...

141
00:16:42,579 --> 00:16:44,102
The storm.

142
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:45,509
The storm.

143
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:48,702
You make my life a storm.

144
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:52,509
You might be crazy like your father.

145
00:16:52,579 --> 00:16:54,374
May he rest in peace.

146
00:16:57,679 --> 00:16:59,577
I think I'm crazy, too.

147
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,306
You do?

148
00:17:05,146 --> 00:17:07,112
I need a psychiatrist.

149
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:10,634
You don't need a psychiatrist,

150
00:17:10,713 --> 00:17:13,111
you need a father confessor.

151
00:17:13,646 --> 00:17:16,703
You'll go tomorrow. Now eat.

152
00:17:17,846 --> 00:17:18,903
Eat.

153
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:25,975
<i>Allow us to feel, Lord our God,
upon receiving you,</i>

154
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:28,709
<i>relief for our body and soul.</i>

155
00:17:29,246 --> 00:17:30,939
<i>Through Christ our Lord.</i>

156
00:17:31,113 --> 00:17:32,908
The Lord is with you.

157
00:17:32,979 --> 00:17:34,410
- And also with you.
- And also with you.

158
00:17:34,479 --> 00:17:36,672
The blessing of almighty God,

159
00:17:36,746 --> 00:17:39,212
the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit

160
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:41,677
- be with you all.
- Amen.

161
00:17:41,746 --> 00:17:42,871
Amen.

162
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:44,509
Go in peace.

163
00:17:44,579 --> 00:17:46,511
Thanks be to God.

164
00:17:46,913 --> 00:17:48,106
Right.

165
00:18:00,213 --> 00:18:02,440
Tell him you want to confess.

166
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:04,805
He'll like that.

167
00:18:08,245 --> 00:18:10,041
I'll wait at home.

168
00:18:12,546 --> 00:18:13,807
Come on.

169
00:18:14,379 --> 00:18:16,141
Go to the sacristy.

170
00:18:16,813 --> 00:18:18,642
I want to see you go.

171
00:18:19,046 --> 00:18:20,103
Yes.

172
00:18:28,245 --> 00:18:29,768
Hello, Father.

173
00:18:32,312 --> 00:18:35,574
Well! You've finally come back.

174
00:18:37,345 --> 00:18:40,209
We've missed you.

175
00:18:40,279 --> 00:18:41,973
I want to confess.

176
00:18:42,979 --> 00:18:47,570
Good, son, it's about time.
Wait for me outside.

177
00:19:11,979 --> 00:19:14,604
POLICE STATION

178
00:19:19,512 --> 00:19:21,944
- Hello.
- What do you need?

179
00:19:22,779 --> 00:19:25,540
- I want to see a detective.
- What for?

180
00:19:26,479 --> 00:19:29,002
To turn myself in for raping a girl.

181
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,875
Some women are lucky.

182
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:35,343
Right there, the one with the photo.

183
00:19:36,312 --> 00:19:37,676
Thank you.

184
00:19:58,245 --> 00:19:59,506
Come in.

185
00:20:01,612 --> 00:20:05,010
- Good morning.
- What do you want?

186
00:20:06,345 --> 00:20:07,971
To report a rape.

187
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:13,136
- You were raped?
- No, I was the rapist.

188
00:20:14,013 --> 00:20:16,570
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

189
00:20:17,746 --> 00:20:21,143
Come in and tell me what you did.

190
00:20:24,713 --> 00:20:26,201
Coming!

191
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:28,609
It smells good. Wet paint.

192
00:20:32,546 --> 00:20:33,705
What?

193
00:20:33,779 --> 00:20:35,142
- Police.
- Police.

194
00:20:35,212 --> 00:20:37,474
- So what?
- Eva Soler lives here?

195
00:20:37,546 --> 00:20:39,069
Of course. Why?

196
00:20:39,846 --> 00:20:42,403
She was raped last night.

197
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,975
My daughter? lmpossible.

198
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:50,407
She would have told me. See you later.

199
00:20:51,112 --> 00:20:52,271
One moment.

200
00:20:52,345 --> 00:20:53,743
Someone's here.

201
00:20:53,813 --> 00:20:55,073
What is it, Mom?

202
00:20:55,145 --> 00:20:58,475
- Nothing. Go to your room.
- Nothing? She's hurt.

203
00:20:58,546 --> 00:21:00,102
Come over here.

204
00:21:03,779 --> 00:21:05,574
I slipped on the mud.

205
00:21:05,646 --> 00:21:08,942
Remember the storm? It was huge.

206
00:21:09,013 --> 00:21:12,172
If he goes free, he may rape you again.

207
00:21:12,546 --> 00:21:14,535
First, he didn't rape me.

208
00:21:14,612 --> 00:21:17,601
- See?
- And if he touches me again,

209
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:19,542
- I'll castrate him.
- She means it.

210
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:21,635
Come with us to the station.

211
00:21:21,713 --> 00:21:26,202
How can we come with you
with the house like it is?

212
00:21:26,279 --> 00:21:30,268
I'm painting
and I have no one to help me with it.

213
00:21:30,345 --> 00:21:32,368
Don't make this difficult.

214
00:21:32,879 --> 00:21:34,936
I have an audition.

215
00:21:35,013 --> 00:21:38,410
We have an audition.
And the house is a mess.

216
00:21:38,479 --> 00:21:40,604
That's enough, ma'am. Be quiet.

217
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:44,475
Don't shout at me or I'll smack you.

218
00:21:46,212 --> 00:21:47,974
It won't take long.

219
00:21:48,479 --> 00:21:52,275
If you don't mind, we'll need to get ready.

220
00:21:52,345 --> 00:21:56,675
We can't go to the station dressed like this.

221
00:21:56,746 --> 00:22:01,041
First they rape you,
then you have to talk about it!

222
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:03,645
Make yourselves at home.

223
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:13,541
Close the door, let's keep this private.

224
00:22:14,713 --> 00:22:17,440
- Have a seat.
- We're in a hurry.

225
00:22:17,813 --> 00:22:19,574
Let's start, please.

226
00:22:21,379 --> 00:22:22,709
Very well.

227
00:22:24,312 --> 00:22:25,642
Are you Eva Soler?

228
00:22:25,713 --> 00:22:27,941
- Yes, I am.
- I'm her mother.

229
00:22:28,512 --> 00:22:30,944
- You know Angel Jiménez?
- Yes.

230
00:22:31,379 --> 00:22:32,709
We're neighbors.

231
00:22:32,779 --> 00:22:36,939
You're very bad, Angel.
Look at her before her audition!

232
00:22:38,546 --> 00:22:40,808
Ma'am, please don't interrupt.

233
00:22:43,579 --> 00:22:45,306
Did Angel rape you?

234
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:48,409
No. He tried to.

235
00:22:50,579 --> 00:22:52,067
He says he did.

236
00:22:52,145 --> 00:22:55,134
No. He came between my legs.

237
00:22:56,446 --> 00:22:57,935
I understand.

238
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:03,405
Tell me exactly what happened.

239
00:23:04,978 --> 00:23:06,035
Ma'am.

240
00:23:06,479 --> 00:23:09,206
- You can wait outside.
- Who, me?

241
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:12,039
This is disagreeable for a mother.

242
00:23:12,379 --> 00:23:16,869
Well, it's not fun, but I'm no child
and we have no secrets.

243
00:23:16,945 --> 00:23:19,275
It's not the first time.

244
00:23:19,345 --> 00:23:21,903
We've had three attempted rapes.

245
00:23:21,978 --> 00:23:24,137
- Or four?
- Three.

246
00:23:24,212 --> 00:23:25,838
Tell me about it.

247
00:23:28,245 --> 00:23:32,200
I left home,
and I imagine Angel followed me...

248
00:23:32,279 --> 00:23:35,507
- What time?
- 8:00.

249
00:23:36,212 --> 00:23:40,440
Are you sure? Think about it, it's important.

250
00:23:41,446 --> 00:23:43,139
Yes. I had a date.

251
00:23:44,112 --> 00:23:45,772
Fine. Go on.

252
00:23:48,179 --> 00:23:50,111
He took me to an alley.

253
00:23:51,579 --> 00:23:53,238
He had a knife.

254
00:23:54,245 --> 00:23:56,370
You know the rest.

255
00:23:57,579 --> 00:24:00,204
- While he was trying...
- He ejaculated.

256
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,671
He ejaculated.

257
00:24:01,746 --> 00:24:03,268
Anything else?

258
00:24:05,479 --> 00:24:09,707
At the end he apologized, then he fainted.

259
00:24:14,045 --> 00:24:15,409
That cut...

260
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:17,310
He did that?

261
00:24:18,713 --> 00:24:20,702
No, I slipped in the mud.

262
00:24:21,646 --> 00:24:23,168
Can we go now?

263
00:24:23,546 --> 00:24:27,410
One moment. Do you want to prosecute?

264
00:24:28,312 --> 00:24:30,141
No. What for?

265
00:24:31,579 --> 00:24:33,010
You have to!

266
00:24:33,412 --> 00:24:35,708
Quiet! You've gone too far.

267
00:24:35,779 --> 00:24:37,836
Think about your mother.

268
00:24:37,912 --> 00:24:39,435
She's so pious.

269
00:24:41,212 --> 00:24:44,007
I'm sorry, ma'am, really I am.

270
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:46,443
Well, control yourself a bit.

271
00:24:46,912 --> 00:24:50,140
If we weren't in the station,
I'd tell you a few things.

272
00:24:50,212 --> 00:24:51,269
Goodbye.

273
00:24:51,345 --> 00:24:52,606
Goodbye.

274
00:25:02,878 --> 00:25:06,038
THE MYSTERIOUS DEATH OF A JEWELER

275
00:25:21,345 --> 00:25:25,004
It's strange. He looks so happy.

276
00:25:25,479 --> 00:25:26,944
What's wrong?

277
00:25:28,379 --> 00:25:30,140
Never seen a corpse?

278
00:25:32,878 --> 00:25:34,469
I've seen a lot.

279
00:25:34,945 --> 00:25:36,808
Why are you trembling?

280
00:25:40,746 --> 00:25:42,644
- Did you know him?
- Yes.

281
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:45,306
Really?

282
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:48,602
Where from?

283
00:25:53,845 --> 00:25:55,311
I killed him.

284
00:25:56,479 --> 00:25:57,604
What?

285
00:26:00,612 --> 00:26:02,077
In his house.

286
00:26:05,546 --> 00:26:07,444
He was very excited.

287
00:26:09,079 --> 00:26:12,204
He just wanted to have me.

288
00:26:16,112 --> 00:26:18,101
He undressed immediately,

289
00:26:19,145 --> 00:26:22,441
and when he tried to penetrate me,

290
00:26:23,713 --> 00:26:25,178
I killed him.

291
00:26:33,579 --> 00:26:35,101
What about him?

292
00:26:36,745 --> 00:26:38,609
Did you know him, too?

293
00:26:40,878 --> 00:26:42,105
Yes.

294
00:26:43,812 --> 00:26:45,937
More or less the same thing.

295
00:26:55,646 --> 00:26:58,873
Tell me about yourself. What do you do?

296
00:27:00,978 --> 00:27:03,672
My mom makes me study agronomics.

297
00:27:04,778 --> 00:27:06,903
But I want to be a bullfighter.

298
00:27:06,978 --> 00:27:09,035
- You like bullfights?
- Yes.

299
00:27:15,479 --> 00:27:17,774
I go to Diego Montes' classes.

300
00:27:18,412 --> 00:27:20,401
She thinks I go to a gym.

301
00:27:21,446 --> 00:27:22,911
Diego Montes.

302
00:27:42,646 --> 00:27:43,906
Angel,

303
00:27:46,245 --> 00:27:48,268
I'll show you some photos.

304
00:27:48,912 --> 00:27:51,707
Study them carefully, please.

305
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:53,734
Take your time.

306
00:27:58,812 --> 00:28:00,472
Do you know them?

307
00:28:05,579 --> 00:28:08,908
Yes, from the bullfighting classes.

308
00:28:10,479 --> 00:28:13,070
I killed them, too.

309
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:27,472
You!

310
00:28:27,546 --> 00:28:28,943
You know me?

311
00:28:30,579 --> 00:28:32,703
No, I don't think so.

312
00:28:33,245 --> 00:28:36,802
My name is María Cardenal. I'm your lawyer.

313
00:28:38,379 --> 00:28:40,368
Why are you defending me?

314
00:28:40,778 --> 00:28:42,744
I think you're innocent.

315
00:28:43,645 --> 00:28:45,111
You're wrong.

316
00:28:46,179 --> 00:28:48,644
I'm guiltier than you can imagine.

317
00:28:49,212 --> 00:28:50,700
Ask my mother.

318
00:28:52,245 --> 00:28:57,075
I will. There's only proof
you tried to rape Eva Soler.

319
00:28:57,479 --> 00:29:00,740
<i>That's not serious? She's my maestro's girl.</i>

320
00:29:05,212 --> 00:29:06,677
By the way,

321
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:10,940
call him and tell him I'm sorry.

322
00:29:12,145 --> 00:29:14,043
It won't happen again.

323
00:29:15,379 --> 00:29:18,539
He's Diego Montes, the bullfighter, right?

324
00:29:20,312 --> 00:29:23,301
Yes. Do you know him?

325
00:29:24,412 --> 00:29:26,378
I've seen him bullfight.

326
00:29:28,112 --> 00:29:30,203
Was he as good as they say?

327
00:29:30,279 --> 00:29:31,869
He was the best.

328
00:29:34,945 --> 00:29:37,503
Back to the matter at hand.

329
00:29:38,745 --> 00:29:41,575
I'll make the decisions from now on.

330
00:29:42,312 --> 00:29:44,005
You understand?

331
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:47,045
Fine. I'll do whatever you tell me.

332
00:29:47,446 --> 00:29:48,934
That's my boy.

333
00:29:50,778 --> 00:29:53,404
Don't accuse yourself of more murders.

334
00:29:54,845 --> 00:29:56,834
Four is enough.

335
00:29:59,878 --> 00:30:01,344
You're right.

336
00:30:26,212 --> 00:30:28,303
Close your eyes. Play dead.

337
00:31:17,112 --> 00:31:20,237
<i>Forty Spaniards are listed as missing.</i>

338
00:31:21,112 --> 00:31:24,237
<i>Police have arrested the man</i>

339
00:31:24,545 --> 00:31:26,943
<i>who raped Eva Soler, Angel Jiménez.</i>

340
00:31:27,012 --> 00:31:29,171
Bastards! They announced it!

341
00:31:30,279 --> 00:31:33,540
<i>... and Ana Vela,
whose bodies have not been found,</i>

342
00:31:33,611 --> 00:31:35,009
<i>and the murders of</i>

343
00:31:35,079 --> 00:31:37,943
<i>RaúI Ordóñez and Pedro Soto.</i>

344
00:31:38,012 --> 00:31:41,342
<i>Attorney María Cardenal will defend him.</i>

345
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:50,067
<i>Naturally, certain feminists have complained
because a woman</i>

346
00:31:50,145 --> 00:31:52,202
<i>is defending this monster.</i>

347
00:31:52,945 --> 00:31:57,900
<i>"The Spanish Constitution
guarantees all citizens a defense, "</i>

348
00:31:57,978 --> 00:32:01,206
<i>Ms. Cardenal dared to declare,</i>

349
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:04,972
<i>showing truly repugnant cynicism.</i>

350
00:32:05,912 --> 00:32:07,105
Jesus.

351
00:32:09,345 --> 00:32:12,243
- Will you take me home?
- Yes.

352
00:32:12,312 --> 00:32:14,709
- Amazing.
- I don't believe it.

353
00:32:14,778 --> 00:32:16,005
Why not?

354
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:18,408
If he were a killer, he wouldn't have fainted,

355
00:32:18,511 --> 00:32:20,443
he'd have killed me.

356
00:32:20,745 --> 00:32:23,939
Poor girl. It must have been horrible.

357
00:32:24,378 --> 00:32:28,368
- Let's forget it.
- The police will remind me.

358
00:32:28,778 --> 00:32:32,437
- Did they call you?
- Not yet, but they will.

359
00:32:33,179 --> 00:32:35,542
Can I have some blood sausage?

360
00:32:36,212 --> 00:32:37,303
Sure.

361
00:32:47,678 --> 00:32:49,473
I feel sorry for Angel.

362
00:32:49,545 --> 00:32:53,069
Don't be naive.
He threatened you with a knife.

363
00:32:54,179 --> 00:32:57,043
- Are you jealous?
- Angel is crazy.

364
00:32:57,112 --> 00:32:58,839
So am I, about you.

365
00:33:00,545 --> 00:33:01,806
Let's go.

366
00:33:24,045 --> 00:33:25,102
Eva.

367
00:33:45,378 --> 00:33:47,106
Is Mrs. Jiménez in?

368
00:33:47,511 --> 00:33:50,636
Well... Wait, I'll go and see.

369
00:34:00,812 --> 00:34:04,710
Ma'am, the woman we saw on TV
wants to see you.

370
00:34:04,778 --> 00:34:06,539
I can't receive her.

371
00:34:06,945 --> 00:34:08,638
She's already received.

372
00:34:08,712 --> 00:34:11,201
Tell her I'm busy.

373
00:34:11,278 --> 00:34:14,109
I have enough problems as it is.

374
00:34:15,012 --> 00:34:16,341
All right.

375
00:34:22,179 --> 00:34:23,769
Madam isn't in.

376
00:34:24,545 --> 00:34:27,103
What do you mean? I heard her.

377
00:34:27,945 --> 00:34:31,604
She can't receive you, she has a visitor.

378
00:34:33,511 --> 00:34:35,034
I'll wait, then.

379
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:44,667
All right, then. What do you want?

380
00:34:45,478 --> 00:34:47,138
I'm María Cardenal.

381
00:34:47,212 --> 00:34:48,234
So?

382
00:34:48,945 --> 00:34:50,911
I'm defending your son.

383
00:34:50,978 --> 00:34:53,307
He must accept God's punishment.

384
00:34:54,012 --> 00:34:56,534
God isn't the one who's trying him.

385
00:34:56,611 --> 00:34:59,100
Are you an atheist, by chance?

386
00:35:00,511 --> 00:35:03,841
Are we going to talk here or sit down?

387
00:35:04,145 --> 00:35:05,940
All right, come in.

388
00:35:06,712 --> 00:35:08,610
I have nothing to say.

389
00:35:10,645 --> 00:35:12,634
And I won't pay you.

390
00:35:13,211 --> 00:35:15,973
I want to talk about Angel, not money.

391
00:35:17,112 --> 00:35:20,044
- Your son...
- He's not my son.

392
00:35:20,678 --> 00:35:23,610
A raping, murdering monster
can't be my son.

393
00:35:24,411 --> 00:35:26,173
God can't expect that.

394
00:35:26,244 --> 00:35:28,210
Forget God for a moment.

395
00:35:29,645 --> 00:35:31,543
I need information.

396
00:35:31,611 --> 00:35:35,135
I did everything I could to save him.

397
00:35:36,012 --> 00:35:37,910
He wasn't like others,

398
00:35:38,311 --> 00:35:41,073
he had terrible visions as a child.

399
00:35:41,611 --> 00:35:43,736
Evil was already inside him.

400
00:35:44,145 --> 00:35:47,633
I tried to teach him to fear himself,
but to no avail.

401
00:35:48,311 --> 00:35:51,971
Ma'am, do you understand
your son's situation?

402
00:35:52,611 --> 00:35:54,543
Do you understand mine?

403
00:35:54,812 --> 00:35:56,539
You're not in jail.

404
00:35:57,511 --> 00:36:01,103
Pain and shame can also be a prison.

405
00:36:01,845 --> 00:36:04,743
How can a mother not defend her child?

406
00:36:05,244 --> 00:36:09,768
There are some people
that you can't defend.

407
00:36:11,145 --> 00:36:14,633
Right, I'd never defend someone like you.

408
00:36:21,745 --> 00:36:22,938
Father.

409
00:37:45,111 --> 00:37:50,100
DUEL IN THE SUN

410
00:37:52,478 --> 00:37:55,410
<i>I can't see you. Can you see me?</i>

411
00:38:16,144 --> 00:38:20,099
<i>Damned traitor!</i>

412
00:38:28,278 --> 00:38:30,141
<i>I want to see her.</i>

413
00:38:31,578 --> 00:38:32,771
<i>No...</i>

414
00:38:34,311 --> 00:38:35,709
<i>No...</i>

415
00:38:43,478 --> 00:38:46,501
<i>You always said you could be flexible,</i>

416
00:38:47,478 --> 00:38:49,273
<i>I didn't believe you.</i>

417
00:38:50,678 --> 00:38:53,803
<i>- I love you.
- Don't cry, Pearl.</i>

418
00:38:54,211 --> 00:38:55,905
<i>Don't cry anymore.</i>

419
00:38:56,411 --> 00:38:59,969
<i>I had to do it. I had to.</i>

420
00:39:01,611 --> 00:39:04,702
<i>Let me... Let me hold you.</i>

421
00:39:05,478 --> 00:39:08,205
<i>- Let me...
- Yes, hold me.</i>

422
00:39:08,278 --> 00:39:10,073
<i>Hold me.</i>

423
00:39:10,578 --> 00:39:12,100
<i>Come to me.</i>

424
00:39:49,745 --> 00:39:55,678
<i>If you need an apartment,
our classified ads offer a selection...</i>

425
00:40:10,745 --> 00:40:12,370
Why are you following me?

426
00:40:12,445 --> 00:40:15,206
This is the men's. Did you see the sign?

427
00:40:16,411 --> 00:40:18,400
Don't trust appearances.

428
00:40:29,944 --> 00:40:32,570
I'll buy you a drink somewhere nicer.

429
00:40:38,011 --> 00:40:39,705
I'm not thirsty,

430
00:40:41,144 --> 00:40:43,110
but I want to talk, too.

431
00:41:00,712 --> 00:41:02,337
It's all yours?

432
00:41:02,411 --> 00:41:04,434
I bought it from the city.

433
00:41:09,778 --> 00:41:12,608
It's very tranquil. And sinister.

434
00:41:13,812 --> 00:41:16,936
- Do you like it?
- Yes, very much.

435
00:41:21,611 --> 00:41:23,736
It must have been expensive.

436
00:41:23,812 --> 00:41:27,505
Money doesn't matter to me.
I made a lot then.

437
00:41:29,211 --> 00:41:30,972
But it wasn't easy.

438
00:41:31,944 --> 00:41:34,638
I don't do things because they're easy.

439
00:42:01,278 --> 00:42:02,800
You like bulls?

440
00:42:03,745 --> 00:42:06,176
- I prefer bullfighters.
- I'm glad.

441
00:42:10,944 --> 00:42:14,274
- I really like a good bullfight.
- Me, too.

442
00:42:21,378 --> 00:42:23,105
- Give it to me.
- No.

443
00:42:23,811 --> 00:42:25,800
Some blood sausages?

444
00:42:26,344 --> 00:42:28,310
Something more personal.

445
00:42:28,877 --> 00:42:30,639
If these will do...

446
00:42:31,944 --> 00:42:33,706
They'll have to do.

447
00:42:45,111 --> 00:42:48,441
- You use videos?
- I tape their bullfights.

448
00:42:50,611 --> 00:42:54,770
Angel. I was with him today at the prison.

449
00:42:54,844 --> 00:42:56,470
I saw you on TV.

450
00:42:56,911 --> 00:42:59,809
Why defend him? He says he's guilty.

451
00:42:59,877 --> 00:43:02,036
He didn't act consciously.

452
00:43:05,478 --> 00:43:07,807
And when he raped my girlfriend?

453
00:43:09,178 --> 00:43:12,338
<i>He tried to imitate his maestro.</i>

454
00:43:13,344 --> 00:43:15,640
That kid is dangerous.

455
00:43:17,378 --> 00:43:20,242
Maybe, but he's so lonely.

456
00:43:21,311 --> 00:43:22,936
I'm lonely, too.

457
00:43:24,211 --> 00:43:26,074
You're dangerous, too.

458
00:44:04,877 --> 00:44:06,740
You wanted to kill me.

459
00:44:07,711 --> 00:44:10,234
I have a right to defend myself.

460
00:44:14,677 --> 00:44:16,507
Give me back the pin.

461
00:44:22,611 --> 00:44:25,304
No, I think I deserve to have it.

462
00:44:27,911 --> 00:44:31,537
You can't hesitate at the moment of the kill.

463
00:44:34,744 --> 00:44:36,869
Bullfighting's golden rule.

464
00:44:54,278 --> 00:44:57,641
Well, if this is a wedding dress, then...

465
00:44:58,711 --> 00:45:02,041
Cover up the scar. They'll think I beat her.

466
00:45:02,111 --> 00:45:04,770
No. Disfigure this side of her face.

467
00:45:04,844 --> 00:45:07,436
No one disfigures my child!

468
00:45:07,511 --> 00:45:09,272
- She'll be lovely.
- Mom!

469
00:45:09,344 --> 00:45:11,537
Is this a fashion show

470
00:45:11,610 --> 00:45:14,667
or examples of anti-cosmetic surgery?

471
00:45:14,744 --> 00:45:16,767
It's a massacre, ma'am.

472
00:45:16,844 --> 00:45:19,242
- Francisco Montesinos?
- Yes.

473
00:45:19,311 --> 00:45:21,072
- Great!
- How vulgar!

474
00:45:21,144 --> 00:45:23,167
- I heard you.
- I know.

475
00:45:23,244 --> 00:45:25,732
I'd like to interview you.

476
00:45:25,811 --> 00:45:27,573
- Tomorrow.
- I'll be brief.

477
00:45:27,644 --> 00:45:30,236
- You're not ready!
- Very brief.

478
00:45:30,777 --> 00:45:31,834
Go ahead.

479
00:45:31,911 --> 00:45:37,707
First of all, why is the show's title
"Divided Spain"? Why?

480
00:45:37,777 --> 00:45:39,902
This country's divided.

481
00:45:39,977 --> 00:45:41,772
Algeria, get dressed!

482
00:45:41,844 --> 00:45:46,038
- Divided in how many parts?
- Two, basically.

483
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:47,236
What are they?

484
00:45:47,311 --> 00:45:49,606
The envious and the intolerant.

485
00:45:49,677 --> 00:45:51,768
Elvira, get ready!

486
00:45:51,844 --> 00:45:54,333
- Which side do you belong to?
- Both.

487
00:45:54,644 --> 00:45:56,633
- Interesting.
- And you?

488
00:45:57,844 --> 00:46:01,606
I've told you not to shoot up
in the dressing rooms!

489
00:46:02,244 --> 00:46:04,403
We're almost finished, man.

490
00:46:04,811 --> 00:46:07,902
If you have to do it, go to the bathrooms.

491
00:46:11,545 --> 00:46:13,272
Why these models...

492
00:46:14,111 --> 00:46:16,668
- Well...
- It's not real.

493
00:46:16,744 --> 00:46:21,540
Don't worry, it looks great on you.
Go out like that.

494
00:46:21,610 --> 00:46:24,304
- Like that?
- Sure, she's a pro.

495
00:46:24,378 --> 00:46:26,139
- It's hot.
- Let's see.

496
00:46:26,211 --> 00:46:29,836
Okay, Juan, you stay in the back,

497
00:46:29,911 --> 00:46:33,400
lying down,
and make sure we can see the cape.

498
00:46:33,677 --> 00:46:37,041
Why does he get killed? Who kills him?

499
00:46:37,111 --> 00:46:38,770
The girl in red.

500
00:46:38,844 --> 00:46:40,367
- Why?
- He beats her.

501
00:46:40,445 --> 00:46:43,638
She doesn't love him and she's cranky.

502
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:46,575
And that's why she's so bloody?

503
00:46:46,644 --> 00:46:48,769
- That's right.
- Interesting.

504
00:46:49,278 --> 00:46:52,176
So you don't believe in marriage?

505
00:46:52,244 --> 00:46:56,233
Marriage is necessary,
otherwise there wouldn't be

506
00:46:56,744 --> 00:46:58,607
wedding dresses.

507
00:46:58,677 --> 00:46:59,802
That's beautiful.

508
00:46:59,877 --> 00:47:01,934
I have to go, I'm busy.

509
00:47:02,011 --> 00:47:06,467
- Francis, the gun.
- Hide it wherever you can.

510
00:47:06,544 --> 00:47:08,567
At the end, they kill you.

511
00:47:11,044 --> 00:47:13,476
Mom, go look for Diego.

512
00:47:13,544 --> 00:47:16,272
Yes, I can't stand all this genius.

513
00:47:43,044 --> 00:47:44,771
- Hi.
- Hi. How are they doing?

514
00:47:44,844 --> 00:47:46,435
It's a madhouse.

515
00:47:46,711 --> 00:47:49,677
I'd never be a model, whatever they say.

516
00:47:51,044 --> 00:47:53,272
- Sunflower seeds?
- No, thanks.

517
00:47:55,610 --> 00:47:56,701
What?

518
00:47:57,378 --> 00:47:59,344
The girl with the braid.

519
00:48:00,911 --> 00:48:05,071
I have a braid, too. But not so showy.

520
00:48:05,411 --> 00:48:07,467
- It looks good.
- Thank you.

521
00:48:14,344 --> 00:48:16,310
You know who it is?

522
00:48:16,877 --> 00:48:18,706
Angel's lawyer.

523
00:48:19,144 --> 00:48:22,439
I didn't know lawyers liked fashion.

524
00:48:26,911 --> 00:48:28,638
She's a bit slutty.

525
00:48:28,711 --> 00:48:31,871
But she is pretty, I admit that.

526
00:48:32,711 --> 00:48:34,371
Excuse me, Pilar.

527
00:48:42,644 --> 00:48:45,133
I don't like this at all!

528
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:25,101
<i>Olé!</i>

529
00:50:43,677 --> 00:50:46,336
I saw a suicide from here once.

530
00:50:49,111 --> 00:50:50,736
I felt strange,

531
00:50:51,444 --> 00:50:55,308
empty and outside my body.

532
00:50:58,811 --> 00:51:00,470
I come here often.

533
00:51:01,844 --> 00:51:05,833
You and I are similar.
We're both obsessed with death.

534
00:51:08,977 --> 00:51:10,567
Everyone is.

535
00:51:16,111 --> 00:51:17,872
Not the way you are.

536
00:51:21,677 --> 00:51:26,473
- What if I hadn't grabbed your hand?
- And if I hadn't defended myself?

537
00:51:49,711 --> 00:51:50,904
Diego,

538
00:51:51,243 --> 00:51:52,800
are you coming?

539
00:51:54,911 --> 00:51:56,138
Not now.

540
00:52:08,610 --> 00:52:11,735
The goring again? You're so morbid.

541
00:52:12,178 --> 00:52:14,609
- We have to talk.
- Some other day.

542
00:52:14,677 --> 00:52:17,268
- It has to be now.
- What is it?

543
00:52:17,777 --> 00:52:20,334
I got a job in Japan for two months.

544
00:52:20,711 --> 00:52:24,905
- My mom's happy, but I'm not.
- It's good for your career.

545
00:52:25,977 --> 00:52:29,068
Fuck my career.
I don't want to leave you alone.

546
00:52:30,011 --> 00:52:31,806
You'd be better off.

547
00:52:33,977 --> 00:52:36,272
- What's wrong?
- Nothing's wrong.

548
00:52:37,510 --> 00:52:39,136
It's that woman.

549
00:52:41,144 --> 00:52:42,575
It can't be.

550
00:52:43,811 --> 00:52:45,936
You left the show together.

551
00:52:46,510 --> 00:52:48,738
- Don't deny it.
- I don't.

552
00:52:50,177 --> 00:52:52,803
- Don't play games with me.
- Don't you.

553
00:52:53,210 --> 00:52:57,041
- Go, I want to be alone.
- Fine, I'm going.

554
00:53:12,410 --> 00:53:13,467
Eva!

555
00:53:14,410 --> 00:53:15,569
Hello.

556
00:53:16,078 --> 00:53:18,737
He's had a few bad days,

557
00:53:19,111 --> 00:53:21,440
but he's a good person.

558
00:53:21,911 --> 00:53:25,138
I wouldn't leave him if he asked me to.

559
00:53:26,243 --> 00:53:27,334
Good.

560
00:53:47,310 --> 00:53:48,469
María!

561
00:54:03,477 --> 00:54:04,670
Who is it?

562
00:54:04,744 --> 00:54:07,676
- Diego. I need to see you.
- No.

563
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:09,403
<i>- Why not?
- Because.</i>

564
00:54:10,444 --> 00:54:13,433
Don't call me. I don't want to see you.

565
00:54:13,510 --> 00:54:14,669
<i>María!</i>

566
00:54:25,410 --> 00:54:27,808
You work here, too?

567
00:54:27,877 --> 00:54:29,968
Yes, twice a week.

568
00:54:31,343 --> 00:54:33,332
- Is María in?
- I think so.

569
00:54:34,077 --> 00:54:36,236
Give this to her when I leave.

570
00:54:36,310 --> 00:54:38,299
- What is it?
- A surprise.

571
00:54:38,777 --> 00:54:40,606
I'll take care of it.

572
00:54:41,277 --> 00:54:43,743
- Where's her office?
- In the back.

573
00:54:43,811 --> 00:54:45,902
But here's her secretary.

574
00:54:47,177 --> 00:54:49,871
- Yes?
- I have an appointment.

575
00:54:49,944 --> 00:54:52,273
- What's your name?
- Diego Montes.

576
00:54:52,911 --> 00:54:54,877
She didn't say anything.

577
00:54:55,644 --> 00:54:57,439
She can be reserved.

578
00:54:58,077 --> 00:55:01,737
Wait here, but I doubt she can see you.

579
00:55:07,410 --> 00:55:10,069
This cocky gentleman wants to see you.

580
00:55:10,911 --> 00:55:12,638
I said wait there!

581
00:55:12,711 --> 00:55:15,575
- Just close the door, please.
- Okay.

582
00:55:19,177 --> 00:55:22,575
- I didn't want to see you.
- We must talk.

583
00:55:22,644 --> 00:55:24,769
- Is it that urgent?
- Yes.

584
00:55:25,243 --> 00:55:27,106
Not here, I'm working.

585
00:55:31,911 --> 00:55:33,536
What do you want?

586
00:55:35,110 --> 00:55:36,201
You.

587
00:55:37,744 --> 00:55:39,403
Can I have my pin?

588
00:55:39,744 --> 00:55:42,209
You only care about your damn pin!

589
00:55:42,277 --> 00:55:43,937
Is this blackmail?

590
00:55:44,377 --> 00:55:45,934
Let's be frank.

591
00:55:46,310 --> 00:55:49,470
- Why are you afraid?
- You know why.

592
00:55:53,777 --> 00:55:54,902
Please go.

593
00:55:55,477 --> 00:55:57,739
We're condemned to each other.

594
00:55:58,343 --> 00:56:00,901
Not even we can avoid it.

595
00:56:01,744 --> 00:56:05,767
Go. If you don't go, I'll shoot myself.

596
00:56:18,277 --> 00:56:19,368
Yes.

597
00:56:20,844 --> 00:56:22,742
This is from Diego.

598
00:56:23,844 --> 00:56:25,833
He gave it to me before coming in.

599
00:56:26,610 --> 00:56:29,804
- You didn't tell him about...
- No. Leave me alone.

600
00:56:39,577 --> 00:56:40,736
Diego.

601
00:56:41,677 --> 00:56:42,836
Diego.

602
00:57:06,343 --> 00:57:10,605
- These are amanitas, right?
- They're very poisonous.

603
00:57:11,210 --> 00:57:13,733
Look at the cap, you see?

604
00:57:13,811 --> 00:57:15,572
It holds the poison.

605
00:57:15,943 --> 00:57:19,842
- Can I take one?
- Yes, but careful.

606
00:57:19,910 --> 00:57:22,001
- Don't eat it.
- Don't worry.

607
00:57:22,711 --> 00:57:25,677
<i>Detective del Valle. Is the maestro in?</i>

608
00:57:26,410 --> 00:57:29,001
He's in the ring with the kids.

609
00:57:29,610 --> 00:57:31,576
- Shall I get him?
- No.

610
00:57:31,644 --> 00:57:33,337
Does he live here?

611
00:57:33,410 --> 00:57:35,342
Upstairs.

612
00:57:35,943 --> 00:57:38,501
He gives theory lessons downstairs.

613
00:57:38,811 --> 00:57:40,276
Let's go take a look.

614
00:57:40,644 --> 00:57:42,871
How long have you worked for him?

615
00:57:43,243 --> 00:57:49,574
Since he started bullfighting.
After the goring, I came here to help.

616
00:57:50,811 --> 00:57:54,402
I live in the house next to the garden.

617
00:57:55,177 --> 00:57:59,075
- With your family?
- Do you live with your family?

618
00:57:59,577 --> 00:58:02,906
They're in Toledo, I go there on weekends.

619
00:58:08,010 --> 00:58:09,340
And this sausage?

620
00:58:09,410 --> 00:58:10,898
"Angel Jiménez."

621
00:58:19,510 --> 00:58:21,032
"Angel Jiménez."

622
00:59:19,077 --> 00:59:22,271
Two policemen are here, watching.

623
00:59:22,343 --> 00:59:25,400
- Where?
- Behind the leaves.

624
00:59:31,943 --> 00:59:35,239
One's a detective. They snooped around.

625
00:59:45,644 --> 00:59:46,836
Hello.

626
00:59:49,510 --> 00:59:51,032
Good afternoon.

627
00:59:51,410 --> 00:59:55,933
I'm Detective del Valle.
I'm on your classmate's case.

628
00:59:56,343 --> 00:59:58,206
I'm Diego Montes.

629
00:59:58,277 --> 00:59:59,675
Yes, I know.

630
01:00:00,810 --> 01:00:04,106
- Will you be long?
- No, we finish at 7:00.

631
01:00:05,810 --> 01:00:08,504
Remember the class of the 27th?

632
01:00:11,010 --> 01:00:13,238
Angel's last day at the school.

633
01:00:13,310 --> 01:00:14,503
I remember.

634
01:00:14,577 --> 01:00:18,475
<i>The maestro was showing us how to kill.</i>

635
01:00:18,544 --> 01:00:21,998
Did he go straight home after class?

636
01:00:24,544 --> 01:00:26,873
Did he talk to any of you?

637
01:00:29,010 --> 01:00:31,840
We talked. He said he had to study.

638
01:00:34,177 --> 01:00:35,609
Now, this.

639
01:00:36,910 --> 01:00:38,342
Look at it.

640
01:00:40,343 --> 01:00:42,332
Does it belong to anyone?

641
01:00:43,310 --> 01:00:44,832
Look carefully.

642
01:00:45,277 --> 01:00:47,607
It's nice. You've never seen it?

643
01:00:50,644 --> 01:00:53,803
You haven't seen Anabel and Esther...

644
01:00:53,876 --> 01:00:56,808
- Domínguez.
...since they disappeared?

645
01:00:56,876 --> 01:00:59,172
- They're dead.
- How do you know?

646
01:00:59,243 --> 01:01:01,141
The newspapers say so.

647
01:01:01,210 --> 01:01:03,176
Maybe. There's no proof.

648
01:01:03,644 --> 01:01:06,700
You must know Angel Jiménez's situation.

649
01:01:08,377 --> 01:01:12,503
I'd like you to tell me about him,
anything you like.

650
01:01:15,943 --> 01:01:16,966
No?

651
01:01:18,043 --> 01:01:21,736
Well, if you suddenly get back your memory,

652
01:01:22,710 --> 01:01:25,733
I'll be at the Tetuán station, okay?

653
01:01:28,243 --> 01:01:29,334
Okay?

654
01:01:29,410 --> 01:01:31,103
- Yes, yes.
- Yes, yes.

655
01:01:31,177 --> 01:01:33,575
Good, you can continue.

656
01:01:34,810 --> 01:01:36,299
You look good.

657
01:01:39,043 --> 01:01:40,373
<i>Maestro,</i>

658
01:01:43,043 --> 01:01:44,906
can I talk to you?

659
01:01:48,410 --> 01:01:50,342
- Wait in the car.
- Okay.

660
01:01:58,077 --> 01:02:01,373
- Is that from the goring?
- Yes. And yours?

661
01:02:02,043 --> 01:02:03,906
Mine is psychological.

662
01:02:06,343 --> 01:02:08,740
Do you think Angel is homosexual?

663
01:02:09,410 --> 01:02:13,069
- What?
- You knew him well, right?

664
01:02:13,544 --> 01:02:16,476
No, I didn't. I just gave him classes.

665
01:02:16,743 --> 01:02:20,574
But he was upstairs that last night.

666
01:02:20,910 --> 01:02:23,240
For some water. What are you getting at?

667
01:02:23,310 --> 01:02:26,798
Nothing. You gave him classes and water.

668
01:02:27,310 --> 01:02:29,798
For a pill. We talked five minutes.

669
01:02:29,910 --> 01:02:31,933
- What about?
- Women.

670
01:02:33,743 --> 01:02:36,073
That night he tried to rape Eva.

671
01:02:37,609 --> 01:02:38,836
What about that?

672
01:02:38,910 --> 01:02:40,773
He's a son of a bitch.

673
01:02:42,609 --> 01:02:44,075
I don't know.

674
01:02:44,943 --> 01:02:49,205
It's hard to classify him.
He's out of the ordinary.

675
01:02:49,943 --> 01:02:51,341
That's true.

676
01:02:51,776 --> 01:02:55,539
The other day he said he really admired you.

677
01:02:55,943 --> 01:02:57,841
- Really?
- Yes.

678
01:02:58,843 --> 01:03:00,570
I don't understand.

679
01:03:05,444 --> 01:03:09,933
Remember when
your two girl students disappeared?

680
01:03:10,510 --> 01:03:13,101
One three months ago, the other four.

681
01:03:13,710 --> 01:03:17,972
Do you remember if it was on a weekend?

682
01:03:18,810 --> 01:03:21,174
We don't have class on weekends.

683
01:03:26,043 --> 01:03:27,373
All right.

684
01:03:34,210 --> 01:03:38,142
- Where did you get the amanita?
- The bullfighting school.

685
01:03:38,210 --> 01:03:40,005
<i>Citrina or phaloides?</i>

686
01:03:41,110 --> 01:03:43,303
<i>Citrina, can't you tell?</i>

687
01:03:44,043 --> 01:03:47,339
How are you doing with Angel Jiménez?

688
01:03:47,410 --> 01:03:49,568
The kid has a guilt complex.

689
01:03:50,444 --> 01:03:52,909
No wonder, with that mother.

690
01:03:52,976 --> 01:03:54,908
Could he be a killer?

691
01:03:55,444 --> 01:03:58,001
You only care if he did it or not,

692
01:03:58,377 --> 01:04:00,240
not about his motives.

693
01:04:00,310 --> 01:04:03,605
Motives? Why is this mushroom poisonous?

694
01:04:04,810 --> 01:04:08,265
It's its nature. Just like our nature.

695
01:04:09,043 --> 01:04:10,474
Evil's inside it.

696
01:04:10,543 --> 01:04:12,839
- And good.
- But good is boring.

697
01:04:12,910 --> 01:04:14,842
People aren't mushrooms.

698
01:04:14,910 --> 01:04:17,399
No, people are more complicated.

699
01:04:18,476 --> 01:04:22,341
I can't believe you can't feel anything
for Angel.

700
01:04:23,743 --> 01:04:27,403
- I feel great curiosity.
- Only that?

701
01:04:27,876 --> 01:04:30,899
In all my cases,
I wish some people were guilty

702
01:04:30,976 --> 01:04:33,272
and others innocent.

703
01:04:35,476 --> 01:04:39,273
As far as Angel goes,
I'd like him to be innocent.

704
01:04:39,643 --> 01:04:42,405
See? You're not as bad as you seem.

705
01:04:43,077 --> 01:04:46,702
- Let's sleep together tonight.
- I said no.

706
01:04:46,776 --> 01:04:50,300
We don't have to fuck, just hold me.

707
01:04:50,377 --> 01:04:51,569
Julia!

708
01:06:57,077 --> 01:06:59,043
He can't hear out of one ear,

709
01:06:59,110 --> 01:07:01,541
that gives him vertigo.

710
01:07:02,943 --> 01:07:05,273
- An operation?
- There's no need.

711
01:07:06,342 --> 01:07:08,172
The other one's fine.

712
01:07:09,177 --> 01:07:13,200
Don't bother him today, he'll be dizzy.
Let him rest.

713
01:07:14,576 --> 01:07:19,531
Doctor, could vertigo make someone
so hypersensitive that...

714
01:07:19,609 --> 01:07:24,405
Doctor, people don't kill
because they're a bit deaf.

715
01:07:24,476 --> 01:07:28,000
Often mental problems have physical roots.

716
01:07:46,876 --> 01:07:50,001
We have to talk about the pin.

717
01:07:50,077 --> 01:07:52,565
- All right?
- Okay.

718
01:07:53,976 --> 01:07:56,407
- Is it really yours?
- Yes.

719
01:07:58,110 --> 01:08:00,507
Why would you want that nice pin?

720
01:08:02,710 --> 01:08:04,199
To kill with.

721
01:08:05,743 --> 01:08:09,402
- Where did you buy it?
- That doesn't matter.

722
01:08:09,910 --> 01:08:13,467
It does. I need to know in order to help you.

723
01:08:15,443 --> 01:08:17,466
Can't they leave me alone?

724
01:08:22,643 --> 01:08:24,939
I'd like to live in the desert.

725
01:08:25,943 --> 01:08:27,102
Alone.

726
01:08:28,443 --> 01:08:30,171
With no one around.

727
01:08:32,776 --> 01:08:34,264
I can't sleep.

728
01:08:36,409 --> 01:08:40,103
I hear the knives go in and out,

729
01:08:41,609 --> 01:08:43,802
the pins pierce the neck,

730
01:08:44,976 --> 01:08:46,999
the shots echo in my head.

731
01:08:49,676 --> 01:08:52,904
I can't take it anymore, I can't take it.

732
01:08:57,077 --> 01:08:59,634
So much killing in this town!

733
01:09:01,176 --> 01:09:03,734
I don't care about crimes in Madrid.

734
01:09:05,376 --> 01:09:06,899
Only yours.

735
01:09:07,710 --> 01:09:10,801
Angel is in no condition to be questioned.

736
01:09:10,876 --> 01:09:13,501
He knows more than he's saying.

737
01:09:14,876 --> 01:09:18,774
- He's with his lawyer.
- "In no condition," eh?

738
01:09:21,910 --> 01:09:23,603
Ana was beautiful.

739
01:09:26,043 --> 01:09:28,440
I trained with her all day

740
01:09:29,043 --> 01:09:30,941
and I got very excited.

741
01:09:33,309 --> 01:09:34,935
After the class,

742
01:09:35,609 --> 01:09:38,302
she waited for me on the platform,

743
01:09:39,710 --> 01:09:40,869
naked.

744
01:09:43,609 --> 01:09:45,041
And there,

745
01:09:46,710 --> 01:09:48,369
I strangled her,

746
01:09:49,643 --> 01:09:51,438
while I had her.

747
01:10:02,443 --> 01:10:04,238
And Esther Domínguez?

748
01:10:06,910 --> 01:10:08,899
I killed her in the tub.

749
01:10:09,376 --> 01:10:11,171
Where are the bodies?

750
01:10:12,576 --> 01:10:14,735
I buried them in the garden.

751
01:10:15,242 --> 01:10:18,538
- By yourself?
- Yes.

752
01:10:21,776 --> 01:10:23,537
Let's go look, then.

753
01:10:28,309 --> 01:10:30,298
- You were listening.
- Yes.

754
01:10:30,976 --> 01:10:33,464
I'll deny it in court.

755
01:10:33,543 --> 01:10:37,771
- I have a witness.
- I didn't hear anything.

756
01:10:39,376 --> 01:10:40,569
Women!

757
01:10:41,409 --> 01:10:44,842
You're all ridiculous and sentimental!

758
01:10:44,910 --> 01:10:47,398
At least I have feelings!

759
01:10:47,476 --> 01:10:49,738
And you seem to have too many.

760
01:10:49,810 --> 01:10:52,173
- Too many what?
- Feelings.

761
01:10:53,543 --> 01:10:55,338
Come on, Angel.

762
01:10:55,409 --> 01:10:57,739
Show the detective the bodies.

763
01:10:58,443 --> 01:11:00,306
Maybe he'll calm down.

764
01:11:00,376 --> 01:11:03,002
Angel can't leave, he has vertigo.

765
01:11:04,076 --> 01:11:06,043
He needs a shot first.

766
01:11:06,109 --> 01:11:08,473
Go on, what are you waiting for?

767
01:11:12,976 --> 01:11:14,601
Get in, scumbag!

768
01:11:36,342 --> 01:11:38,570
Where did you bury them?

769
01:11:52,443 --> 01:11:54,204
Hurry up!

770
01:12:36,943 --> 01:12:39,374
<i>Look, a russula.</i>

771
01:12:40,543 --> 01:12:43,668
<i>- A russula.
- A cyanoxantha. I see.</i>

772
01:13:00,109 --> 01:13:02,473
Come and help him dig.

773
01:13:02,543 --> 01:13:04,475
Start with the picks.

774
01:13:09,042 --> 01:13:10,531
Get back, son.

775
01:13:46,209 --> 01:13:47,698
Here they are.

776
01:13:47,776 --> 01:13:48,968
Right.

777
01:13:52,209 --> 01:13:53,902
Get the body bags.

778
01:14:30,875 --> 01:14:33,706
- Now what can we do?
- I don't know.

779
01:14:33,942 --> 01:14:35,965
It's a challenging case.

780
01:14:36,042 --> 01:14:37,474
<i>Maestro,</i>

781
01:14:38,576 --> 01:14:42,099
I want to apologize for what I did to Eva.

782
01:14:42,710 --> 01:14:45,039
Compared to this, it's nothing.

783
01:14:45,509 --> 01:14:46,566
Yes.

784
01:14:48,309 --> 01:14:50,172
- No hard feelings?
- No.

785
01:14:53,309 --> 01:14:54,570
Trust me.

786
01:14:55,276 --> 01:14:56,537
- Am I in danger?
- Yes.

787
01:14:56,609 --> 01:14:58,507
- Let's go.
- But trust me.

788
01:14:58,576 --> 01:15:01,565
- Take Angel to the car.
- Let's go, Angel.

789
01:15:02,842 --> 01:15:05,104
Why must you trust him?

790
01:15:05,176 --> 01:15:08,301
<i>- He still thinks I'm his maestro.
- Aren't you?</i>

791
01:15:09,509 --> 01:15:11,498
I didn't teach him to dig.

792
01:15:11,576 --> 01:15:15,871
How could he bury two bodies here
without your knowledge?

793
01:15:16,309 --> 01:15:18,866
He'd need four hours. I'm not always here.

794
01:15:18,942 --> 01:15:21,465
- That's a bad argument.
- So is yours.

795
01:15:22,743 --> 01:15:25,573
- Get better evidence against me.
- I will.

796
01:15:25,643 --> 01:15:27,835
I'll get better arguments.

797
01:15:29,443 --> 01:15:30,773
We'll see.

798
01:15:42,676 --> 01:15:45,835
I suspected it, but I wasn't sure until today.

799
01:15:49,076 --> 01:15:51,304
I want to show you something.

800
01:16:16,042 --> 01:16:18,668
I've never brought anyone here before.

801
01:16:19,509 --> 01:16:21,099
It's wonderful.

802
01:16:21,176 --> 01:16:24,767
I have a surprise for you. Close your eyes.

803
01:16:26,909 --> 01:16:28,875
Careful, there's a step.

804
01:16:35,443 --> 01:16:36,840
I can't see.

805
01:16:37,909 --> 01:16:39,000
Wait.

806
01:16:45,443 --> 01:16:47,341
You can open your eyes.

807
01:16:59,809 --> 01:17:01,036
My suit!

808
01:17:04,842 --> 01:17:06,570
How did you get it?

809
01:17:07,209 --> 01:17:09,175
From your sword handler.

810
01:17:11,142 --> 01:17:12,631
And what about all this?

811
01:17:13,742 --> 01:17:16,641
Your maid stole it and sold it to me.

812
01:17:19,643 --> 01:17:21,506
Why didn't I ever see you?

813
01:17:24,842 --> 01:17:27,468
How long have you collected my things?

814
01:17:29,276 --> 01:17:31,367
Since I first saw you kill.

815
01:17:33,109 --> 01:17:34,336
Diego...

816
01:17:35,509 --> 01:17:37,634
I've looked for you in all the men I've loved.

817
01:17:39,975 --> 01:17:42,305
I tried to imitate you
while I was killing them.

818
01:17:44,576 --> 01:17:46,599
Why didn't you contact me?

819
01:17:48,276 --> 01:17:51,003
I didn't know you were still a matador.

820
01:17:55,842 --> 01:17:59,331
I tried to avoid it, but I couldn't.

821
01:18:00,942 --> 01:18:02,771
Giving up killing

822
01:18:02,842 --> 01:18:06,002
was like giving up living.

823
01:18:06,975 --> 01:18:09,168
Men think killing is a crime.

824
01:18:12,142 --> 01:18:14,472
We women don't see it that way.

825
01:18:16,176 --> 01:18:18,733
Every criminal has a feminine side.

826
01:18:18,809 --> 01:18:21,241
And every killer, a masculine one.

827
01:18:21,775 --> 01:18:23,968
I've waited so long for this,

828
01:18:24,443 --> 01:18:26,432
I feel like I'm dreaming.

829
01:18:27,842 --> 01:18:31,206
But since I met you I haven't slept.

830
01:18:31,909 --> 01:18:33,704
I can't sleep either.

831
01:18:34,009 --> 01:18:35,975
That means I don't live.

832
01:18:37,875 --> 01:18:40,807
I feel I won't sleep if you exist.

833
01:18:42,709 --> 01:18:44,698
I won't live if you live.

834
01:18:53,076 --> 01:18:57,838
Your son can't be guilty of
at least one of the murders.

835
01:18:59,342 --> 01:19:01,103
He was at his class.

836
01:19:01,675 --> 01:19:04,198
You confirm he came home afterwards.

837
01:19:04,942 --> 01:19:07,908
Yes, but what about the other three?

838
01:19:08,476 --> 01:19:10,101
There's evidence.

839
01:19:10,809 --> 01:19:14,333
The more there is,
the less guilty I think he is.

840
01:19:14,875 --> 01:19:16,932
Interesting method you have.

841
01:19:17,009 --> 01:19:19,770
- Angel's hiding things.
- That's news.

842
01:19:21,543 --> 01:19:24,599
Talk to him, he won't lie to you.

843
01:19:25,076 --> 01:19:29,372
He's been lying to me for the last 22 years.

844
01:19:30,342 --> 01:19:32,240
Just like his father,

845
01:19:32,575 --> 01:19:33,734
may he rest in peace.

846
01:19:33,809 --> 01:19:36,037
Then talk to his psychiatrist.

847
01:19:36,775 --> 01:19:38,764
Let's go to the hospital.

848
01:19:39,276 --> 01:19:41,265
I want to be present.

849
01:19:49,875 --> 01:19:52,568
Come on, bed three is clean.

850
01:19:58,709 --> 01:20:00,505
Jesus, he's fainted.

851
01:20:00,875 --> 01:20:03,068
Slap him a couple of times.

852
01:20:04,909 --> 01:20:06,068
Angel.

853
01:20:09,042 --> 01:20:10,837
- Idiot!
- What happened?

854
01:20:10,909 --> 01:20:13,534
- We came in and he fainted.
- He's weak.

855
01:20:13,909 --> 01:20:16,137
- Get some smelling salts.
- Yes.

856
01:20:17,142 --> 01:20:18,539
He hardly eats.

857
01:20:18,642 --> 01:20:21,165
No, it's seeing that other patient.

858
01:20:21,775 --> 01:20:23,741
He can't stand blood.

859
01:20:24,842 --> 01:20:28,366
He can't stand the sight of blood?

860
01:20:28,443 --> 01:20:30,238
No. He's not like me.

861
01:20:31,176 --> 01:20:34,040
He's a coward, like his father.

862
01:20:34,909 --> 01:20:37,171
He'd never flagellate himself.

863
01:20:37,608 --> 01:20:39,870
One drop of blood, he'd faint.

864
01:20:40,675 --> 01:20:42,903
Do you see what you're saying?

865
01:20:44,009 --> 01:20:46,975
Of course. I'm his mother.

866
01:20:47,742 --> 01:20:51,902
- And you think he's a killer?
- I wouldn't be surprised.

867
01:20:52,276 --> 01:20:55,299
How could he be if he can't stand blood?

868
01:20:57,142 --> 01:20:58,630
I don't know.

869
01:21:00,775 --> 01:21:02,798
The devil has many tricks.

870
01:21:04,742 --> 01:21:05,969
Remember that.

871
01:21:06,042 --> 01:21:07,406
Poor Angel.

872
01:21:23,475 --> 01:21:27,101
- The smelling salts.
- He doesn't need them.

873
01:21:27,508 --> 01:21:29,134
<i>With the eclipse,</i>

874
01:21:29,575 --> 01:21:31,371
<i>the sky will go dark</i>

875
01:21:31,442 --> 01:21:35,170
<i>and the stars will become visible.</i>

876
01:21:35,775 --> 01:21:38,003
<i>Birds will fly to their nests</i>

877
01:21:38,076 --> 01:21:43,065
<i>and animals return to their lairs,
thinking night has come.</i>

878
01:21:43,342 --> 01:21:47,001
<i>They won't suspect the sun will shine again
in a few minutes,</i>

879
01:21:47,076 --> 01:21:50,372
<i>upsetting these irrational beings,</i>

880
01:21:50,442 --> 01:21:52,499
<i>slaves to their instincts.</i>

881
01:21:53,142 --> 01:21:54,732
What a universe!

882
01:21:55,408 --> 01:22:01,705
<i>Because of the eclipse, our country
will be visited by many scientists...</i>

883
01:22:01,775 --> 01:22:03,673
Want to go to a movie?

884
01:22:05,875 --> 01:22:08,534
- Not getting up today?
- No.

885
01:22:08,608 --> 01:22:11,097
- Because of the eclipse?
- What?

886
01:22:11,176 --> 01:22:13,108
It was just on TV.

887
01:22:14,342 --> 01:22:16,274
You're a bit out of it.

888
01:22:17,575 --> 01:22:21,008
Is it because of Diego? Forget him.

889
01:22:21,709 --> 01:22:24,267
You could catch something better,

890
01:22:25,209 --> 01:22:27,436
a lawyer, senator, or dentist.

891
01:22:27,809 --> 01:22:29,570
It would be easier.

892
01:22:30,775 --> 01:22:32,570
Get one for yourself.

893
01:22:34,342 --> 01:22:36,205
Don't make my mistake.

894
01:22:36,709 --> 01:22:39,607
At your age, I was pretty, too.

895
01:22:40,709 --> 01:22:43,005
Mom, I love him.

896
01:22:43,076 --> 01:22:45,906
I loved your dad. What good was that?

897
01:22:49,442 --> 01:22:52,567
<i>- Hello?
- Eva, it's Diego.</i>

898
01:22:53,042 --> 01:22:55,031
I was thinking about you.

899
01:22:55,375 --> 01:22:59,240
<i>I left your things with Mariano.
Come get them.</i>

900
01:23:00,042 --> 01:23:03,099
<i>- We have to talk.
- It wouldn't do any good.</i>

901
01:23:04,608 --> 01:23:09,905
<i>- I'm having an awful time.
- It would be worse if we stayed together.</i>

902
01:23:10,875 --> 01:23:12,568
<i>- But...
- I'm sorry.</i>

903
01:23:14,142 --> 01:23:15,334
Diego?

904
01:23:18,642 --> 01:23:21,234
You have to try harder, honey.

905
01:23:22,309 --> 01:23:24,070
Leave me alone! Go!

906
01:23:29,542 --> 01:23:33,565
Eva, dear, you've been in there
for half an hour.

907
01:23:34,276 --> 01:23:36,468
Open up, I'm getting worried.

908
01:23:37,542 --> 01:23:39,508
I made gazpacho for you.

909
01:23:45,076 --> 01:23:49,770
- You look so pale. Are you all right?
- It's my makeup.

910
01:23:50,875 --> 01:23:52,738
- You look dead.
- Good.

911
01:23:53,308 --> 01:23:54,797
Help me with this.

912
01:23:54,875 --> 01:23:56,864
Here. Don't step on it.

913
01:23:58,209 --> 01:24:01,004
- Where are you going?
- For a walk.

914
01:24:02,009 --> 01:24:04,873
Then you wonder why they rape you.

915
01:24:06,975 --> 01:24:10,100
- You're going to him?
- None of your business.

916
01:24:10,842 --> 01:24:12,103
Good-bye.

917
01:24:13,608 --> 01:24:15,938
What you put me through!

918
01:24:19,109 --> 01:24:20,699
- Hi.
- Hello, Eva.

919
01:24:20,775 --> 01:24:23,502
Diego's not here. He left a bag for you.

920
01:24:24,076 --> 01:24:25,564
I came for it.

921
01:24:25,975 --> 01:24:27,702
I was just leaving.

922
01:24:28,142 --> 01:24:31,437
On the early bus, because of the eclipse.

923
01:24:33,642 --> 01:24:35,108
No, no, wait.

924
01:24:42,142 --> 01:24:46,574
Let me in.
I have to talk to him and it's cold out.

925
01:24:47,275 --> 01:24:50,003
How can you go out half-naked?

926
01:24:50,408 --> 01:24:51,897
Let me go in.

927
01:24:53,076 --> 01:24:55,008
He'll be angry with me.

928
01:24:55,608 --> 01:24:58,904
- He told me not to.
- Mariano, please.

929
01:25:01,675 --> 01:25:06,471
Go in, and what will be, will be.
You two work it out.

930
01:25:40,308 --> 01:25:44,673
DEAR DIEGO:

931
01:25:48,175 --> 01:25:52,267
I CAME

932
01:26:00,175 --> 01:26:05,164
DEAR DIEGO:
I LOVE YOU

933
01:26:06,608 --> 01:26:09,199
EVA

934
01:26:42,341 --> 01:26:45,273
- Where's the poster?
- Behind the board.

935
01:26:46,909 --> 01:26:50,341
Don't worry.
Mariano didn't see you kill or bury them.

936
01:26:50,975 --> 01:26:54,566
No, the girls disappeared on a weekend

937
01:26:54,642 --> 01:26:58,597
and the police know Mariano was in Toledo.

938
01:26:58,675 --> 01:27:02,767
Always worried. They have nothing on you.

939
01:27:03,175 --> 01:27:05,733
- How did Angel know?
- I don't know.

940
01:27:06,175 --> 01:27:07,869
But he won't talk.

941
01:27:08,341 --> 01:27:10,204
I know police tactics.

942
01:27:10,642 --> 01:27:14,938
They're waiting for you to get nervous
and make a mistake.

943
01:27:15,009 --> 01:27:18,099
So what are we waiting for? Why prolong it?

944
01:27:19,542 --> 01:27:24,066
Since I met you,
I'm on the edge of a huge orgasm.

945
01:27:25,775 --> 01:27:27,570
I like prolonging it.

946
01:27:29,241 --> 01:27:33,640
They know now
Angel couldn't have killed the men.

947
01:27:34,241 --> 01:27:37,639
They won't suspect me,
no one saw me with them.

948
01:27:38,942 --> 01:27:40,464
Only with you.

949
01:27:41,009 --> 01:27:42,872
You're my only danger.

950
01:27:43,542 --> 01:27:47,599
It would be absurd for the police
to catch us now.

951
01:27:48,442 --> 01:27:50,203
That's not our plan.

952
01:27:51,341 --> 01:27:54,273
I want you to give Angel a cape.

953
01:27:56,275 --> 01:27:58,605
I'm too excited to think.

954
01:27:59,909 --> 01:28:03,671
- I need a week to get things ready.
- Not a minute more.

955
01:28:07,075 --> 01:28:09,371
Do you want it as much as I do?

956
01:28:10,442 --> 01:28:13,704
More. I've waited longer for it than you have.

957
01:28:16,408 --> 01:28:18,101
You'll need a bag.

958
01:28:29,608 --> 01:28:31,801
- What's wrong?
- I'm impatient.

959
01:28:34,075 --> 01:28:36,701
- Any message for Angel?
- Yes.

960
01:28:38,041 --> 01:28:39,667
Tell him thanks.

961
01:28:40,241 --> 01:28:43,105
Only a desperate man would say that.

962
01:28:43,442 --> 01:28:44,931
I'm desperate.

963
01:28:48,642 --> 01:28:50,608
Call me at the office.

964
01:28:51,809 --> 01:28:54,001
We'll prepare things tonight.

965
01:29:10,842 --> 01:29:12,398
Eva, come out!

966
01:29:18,008 --> 01:29:19,497
I warned you.

967
01:29:20,308 --> 01:29:22,171
Why didn't you listen?

968
01:29:25,508 --> 01:29:27,064
I heard it all.

969
01:29:27,942 --> 01:29:30,203
I shouldn't have trusted you.

970
01:29:30,909 --> 01:29:35,170
You'll have to now.
Your future depends on me.

971
01:29:36,241 --> 01:29:37,832
And yours on me.

972
01:29:44,075 --> 01:29:45,769
You're not afraid?

973
01:29:46,608 --> 01:29:49,631
I'm only afraid that you'll leave me.

974
01:29:49,974 --> 01:29:52,839
I never wanted to mix you up in this.

975
01:29:53,875 --> 01:29:55,033
Diego.

976
01:29:56,108 --> 01:29:58,006
Just go and forget me.

977
01:30:00,341 --> 01:30:03,966
I don't want to forget you. I can't.

978
01:30:04,608 --> 01:30:06,971
- I love you.
- You'll get over it.

979
01:30:07,542 --> 01:30:09,905
You have your life ahead of you.

980
01:30:12,642 --> 01:30:15,767
I don't want to. It's that woman's fault.

981
01:30:16,175 --> 01:30:19,039
- She drove you crazy.
- I am crazy.

982
01:30:19,108 --> 01:30:22,438
- There's no fixing that.
- There is, trust me.

983
01:30:22,508 --> 01:30:24,804
Forget me and what you heard.

984
01:30:24,875 --> 01:30:29,432
I will if you stay with me.
We'll bullfight together.

985
01:30:29,508 --> 01:30:31,736
Eva, I don't want to hurt you.

986
01:30:32,341 --> 01:30:34,569
Don't make it more difficult.

987
01:30:35,075 --> 01:30:36,904
We can save our love.

988
01:30:37,775 --> 01:30:39,741
- You really believe that?
- Yes.

989
01:30:39,809 --> 01:30:43,172
I can rebuild it, trust me.

990
01:30:43,974 --> 01:30:45,838
Just give me a chance.

991
01:30:47,141 --> 01:30:50,733
Fine, rebuild it.

992
01:30:51,974 --> 01:30:53,600
Let me stay here.

993
01:30:54,775 --> 01:30:58,366
No, I'm too nervous today. Come tomorrow.

994
01:30:58,442 --> 01:31:00,431
You'll go to her office.

995
01:31:01,175 --> 01:31:03,505
- No.
- Promise me.

996
01:31:04,141 --> 01:31:08,164
I promise, but you promise
you'll forget what you heard.

997
01:31:12,775 --> 01:31:15,104
Keep your word, I'll keep mine.

998
01:31:27,775 --> 01:31:29,434
Remember our deal.

999
01:31:31,841 --> 01:31:33,034
Diego.

1000
01:31:33,642 --> 01:31:36,335
Eva was hiding here and heard it all.

1001
01:31:37,275 --> 01:31:39,503
Didn't you break up with that brat?

1002
01:31:39,575 --> 01:31:41,904
- Yes, but...
- How did she react?

1003
01:31:42,442 --> 01:31:45,999
I promised to go back to her,
but I don't think she believed me.

1004
01:31:46,075 --> 01:31:48,405
I knew she'd bring us problems.

1005
01:31:48,941 --> 01:31:51,533
We can't wait any longer.

1006
01:31:52,642 --> 01:31:55,005
We have to buy something, right?

1007
01:31:56,341 --> 01:32:00,330
I'll see you at the Almirante jewelry store.

1008
01:32:01,008 --> 01:32:02,599
<i>Don't take too long.</i>

1009
01:32:02,675 --> 01:32:04,163
I won't, dear.

1010
01:32:22,941 --> 01:32:24,237
I'm leaving.

1011
01:32:24,308 --> 01:32:26,137
He's waiting for you.

1012
01:32:26,208 --> 01:32:28,106
On Monday. I'm sorry.

1013
01:32:28,175 --> 01:32:30,300
Send this to Angel Jiménez.

1014
01:32:30,375 --> 01:32:33,000
- Is anything wrong?
- No. The eclipse.

1015
01:32:39,709 --> 01:32:42,833
- We must talk.
- Come back on Monday.

1016
01:32:43,808 --> 01:32:46,831
You're going to him, you bitch.

1017
01:33:18,642 --> 01:33:20,631
- I heard it all.
- So what?

1018
01:33:21,308 --> 01:33:23,240
- You're in my hands.
- Really?

1019
01:33:23,308 --> 01:33:24,933
You know you are.

1020
01:33:26,941 --> 01:33:29,907
- What do you want?
- Leave him.

1021
01:33:29,974 --> 01:33:31,497
Diego needs me.

1022
01:33:32,208 --> 01:33:35,697
Wouldn't it be dangerous
for you to be with him?

1023
01:33:36,608 --> 01:33:39,971
- I'm not afraid.
- You have no idea.

1024
01:33:40,041 --> 01:33:42,234
He was fine before he met you.

1025
01:33:42,308 --> 01:33:44,274
Except for the murders.

1026
01:33:44,341 --> 01:33:48,501
He had a crisis after the goring,
but he's better. I love him.

1027
01:33:49,508 --> 01:33:52,962
You can't give him what he needs.

1028
01:33:53,908 --> 01:33:57,272
Diego belongs to another species. Mine.

1029
01:33:58,874 --> 01:34:02,671
I'll tell the police. You're lost without me.

1030
01:34:03,508 --> 01:34:07,099
No one will believe you
or what's between us.

1031
01:34:23,774 --> 01:34:26,434
<i>"When two heavenly bodies meet,</i>

1032
01:34:26,508 --> 01:34:28,905
<i>"their light seems to go out,</i>

1033
01:34:29,741 --> 01:34:32,037
<i>"but in their brief convergence,</i>

1034
01:34:32,642 --> 01:34:36,096
<i>"they acquire a new luminosity,</i>

1035
01:34:36,641 --> 01:34:39,698
<i>"black and ardent."</i>

1036
01:34:42,874 --> 01:34:45,272
An eclipse. How beautiful!

1037
01:34:45,341 --> 01:34:47,239
Something horrible
is going to happen today.

1038
01:34:47,308 --> 01:34:49,467
The eclipse is affecting you.

1039
01:34:50,141 --> 01:34:51,731
We must do something.

1040
01:34:51,808 --> 01:34:54,434
I have a not very scientific theory.

1041
01:34:55,008 --> 01:35:00,532
Every time you have vertigo,
you enter an almost hypnotic state.

1042
01:35:03,475 --> 01:35:06,634
I'd like to know what's happening to you.

1043
01:35:07,607 --> 01:35:09,335
We have to stop it.

1044
01:35:09,408 --> 01:35:11,930
We could operate on your ear.

1045
01:35:12,408 --> 01:35:13,805
It's Diego.

1046
01:35:14,508 --> 01:35:16,235
Can you see him?

1047
01:35:16,308 --> 01:35:18,796
He's with María. They're in danger.

1048
01:35:19,475 --> 01:35:20,804
What else?

1049
01:35:21,542 --> 01:35:24,372
They've stopped to buy flowers.

1050
01:35:24,908 --> 01:35:26,737
The flowers are dangerous?

1051
01:35:26,874 --> 01:35:29,534
I'll buy you a car like that.

1052
01:35:31,208 --> 01:35:34,299
- Buy some flowers, handsome.
- Roses.

1053
01:35:34,974 --> 01:35:37,633
Grab them, I'm holding the baby.

1054
01:35:38,508 --> 01:35:41,531
Another bunch, you can afford it.

1055
01:35:45,341 --> 01:35:49,205
Thanks, big spender.
I'll read your palm, too.

1056
01:36:02,607 --> 01:36:03,937
What a pity.

1057
01:36:05,841 --> 01:36:09,171
You're his girlfriend. This isn't revenge?

1058
01:36:09,874 --> 01:36:12,931
I told you. Why not go and see?

1059
01:36:13,008 --> 01:36:14,974
Don't worry, I will.

1060
01:36:17,774 --> 01:36:19,468
<i>- Yes?
- Hi, it's me.</i>

1061
01:36:19,541 --> 01:36:20,700
Hello.

1062
01:36:21,175 --> 01:36:23,300
<i>Angel says Diego's in danger.</i>

1063
01:36:23,375 --> 01:36:26,568
You too? What's with you women today?

1064
01:36:27,108 --> 01:36:28,733
<i>He's with María.</i>

1065
01:36:29,375 --> 01:36:31,602
<i>- How do you know?
- Angel told me.</i>

1066
01:36:31,674 --> 01:36:34,038
He saw them out the window?

1067
01:36:34,108 --> 01:36:37,097
<i>Angel sees more than we do.</i>

1068
01:36:37,175 --> 01:36:39,198
You'll drive me nuts.

1069
01:36:39,275 --> 01:36:44,401
Eva's here and she accused
Diego and María of the murders.

1070
01:36:45,375 --> 01:36:48,670
<i>So something is happening. Wait for us.</i>

1071
01:36:51,208 --> 01:36:52,833
What's going on?

1072
01:36:53,908 --> 01:36:55,397
I wish I knew.

1073
01:36:56,541 --> 01:36:58,167
So do something.

1074
01:37:11,208 --> 01:37:13,071
- Here they are.
- We must hurry.

1075
01:37:13,141 --> 01:37:14,538
- Yes.
- Hold on.

1076
01:37:14,607 --> 01:37:16,471
- They're getting away.
- Wait.

1077
01:37:16,541 --> 01:37:19,530
Eva says they left half an hour ago.

1078
01:37:19,607 --> 01:37:22,505
- They'd be out of Madrid.
- Not yet.

1079
01:37:23,375 --> 01:37:25,932
- You cut your hair!
- Don't you like it?

1080
01:37:26,008 --> 01:37:28,838
- Angel, can you really see them?
- Yes.

1081
01:37:29,341 --> 01:37:33,239
- Where are they now?
- To the left of a tunnel.

1082
01:37:33,308 --> 01:37:36,796
- A tunnel?
- Now by a fountain with birds.

1083
01:37:36,874 --> 01:37:38,067
Plaza Mariano de Cavia.

1084
01:37:38,141 --> 01:37:39,970
- The road to Valencia.
- Valencia?

1085
01:37:40,041 --> 01:37:43,598
Get an arrest warrant
and go to Diego's house.

1086
01:37:43,674 --> 01:37:46,163
- And María?
- Check her office and home.

1087
01:37:46,841 --> 01:37:51,466
I hate making a fool out of myself,
so you'd better be right.

1088
01:37:59,008 --> 01:38:02,304
- Now where?
- Straight towards Valencia.

1089
01:38:05,375 --> 01:38:09,773
- You still see the car?
- Yes. They're near a factory.

1090
01:38:11,874 --> 01:38:13,840
The Chinchón distillery.

1091
01:38:16,208 --> 01:38:18,140
Why do you believe him?

1092
01:38:19,841 --> 01:38:22,239
The eclipse has hypnotized you.

1093
01:38:22,308 --> 01:38:26,535
Some things are beyond reason.
This is one of them.

1094
01:38:43,541 --> 01:38:45,030
Home at last.

1095
01:38:45,641 --> 01:38:47,470
Help me set this up.

1096
01:38:47,541 --> 01:38:49,871
- Sure.
- So long planning this

1097
01:38:50,874 --> 01:38:52,863
and now we're unprepared.

1098
01:38:58,808 --> 01:39:01,501
I've felt this scar in me for so long.

1099
01:39:02,008 --> 01:39:04,371
But I've never kissed it before.

1100
01:39:21,208 --> 01:39:26,163
<i>Wait for me in heaven, my love</i>

1101
01:39:27,874 --> 01:39:33,136
<i>If you get there first</i>

1102
01:39:34,275 --> 01:39:38,764
<i>Wait for me, I'll be there soon</i>

1103
01:39:40,108 --> 01:39:45,166
<i>Wherever it is you are</i>

1104
01:39:46,774 --> 01:39:51,934
<i>Wait for me in heaven, my love</i>

1105
01:39:52,974 --> 01:39:57,202
<i>If you get there first</i>

1106
01:39:59,507 --> 01:40:03,564
<i>Wait for me, I'll be there soon</i>

1107
01:40:05,008 --> 01:40:09,940
<i>To start all over again</i>

1108
01:40:13,175 --> 01:40:16,698
<i>Our love is so great</i>

1109
01:40:16,841 --> 01:40:20,274
<i>So great that it will</i>

1110
01:40:20,441 --> 01:40:23,272
<i>Never end</i>

1111
01:40:25,607 --> 01:40:30,539
<i>And life is so short that it's not enough</i>

1112
01:40:31,941 --> 01:40:36,373
<i>For our romance</i>

1113
01:40:37,108 --> 01:40:40,562
<i>That's why I beg you</i>

1114
01:40:40,641 --> 01:40:43,368
<i>Please</i>

1115
01:40:43,441 --> 01:40:47,931
<i>Wait for me in heaven</i>

1116
01:40:49,607 --> 01:40:54,505
<i>There among cotton clouds</i>

1117
01:40:55,274 --> 01:40:59,604
<i>We'll build our nest</i>

1118
01:41:03,941 --> 01:41:06,338
I've never been kissed like that.

1119
01:41:07,474 --> 01:41:09,770
Till now, I've made love alone.

1120
01:41:10,974 --> 01:41:13,838
I love you more than my own death.

1121
01:41:15,340 --> 01:41:17,431
Do you want to see me dead?

1122
01:41:18,741 --> 01:41:22,503
Yes, and for you to see me dead.

1123
01:41:27,041 --> 01:41:28,529
You hear them?

1124
01:41:28,941 --> 01:41:32,169
Yes, she says,

1125
01:41:33,941 --> 01:41:36,372
"I've never been kissed like that.

1126
01:41:38,874 --> 01:41:41,339
"Till now, I've made love alone.

1127
01:41:44,274 --> 01:41:46,797
"I love you more than my own death.

1128
01:41:47,274 --> 01:41:49,502
"Do you want to see me dead?"

1129
01:41:50,874 --> 01:41:52,635
What does he answer?

1130
01:41:54,340 --> 01:41:57,932
"Yes, and for you to see me dead."

1131
01:42:56,441 --> 01:42:57,600
Look at me.

1132
01:42:57,674 --> 01:43:02,163
Look at me, look at me, look at me,
look at how I die.

1133
01:43:06,808 --> 01:43:09,535
Look at me, look at me.

1134
01:43:14,507 --> 01:43:15,939
The eclipse!

1135
01:43:46,274 --> 01:43:49,798
- I couldn't save him.
- Nobody could have.

1136
01:43:51,174 --> 01:43:53,004
It's better this way.

1137
01:43:55,641 --> 01:43:58,005
I've never seen anyone so happy.

1138
01:44:08,174 --> 01:44:10,106
END
