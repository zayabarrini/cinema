1
00:01:38,271 --> 00:01:40,854
Sit down and start undressing.

2
00:01:47,063 --> 00:01:48,647
There's no hurry.

3
00:01:52,564 --> 00:01:53,898
Like that.

4
00:02:02,315 --> 00:02:05,108
Keep your underpants on for now.

5
00:02:05,192 --> 00:02:06,774
Don't look at me.

6
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:09,025
Don't look at me!

7
00:02:09,483 --> 00:02:11,567
Remember, you're alone.

8
00:02:12,442 --> 00:02:14,859
There's a mirror on your left.

9
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,401
See it?

10
00:02:19,984 --> 00:02:22,359
Stand up and get near it.

11
00:02:25,193 --> 00:02:27,234
Watch yourself in the mirror.

12
00:02:29,027 --> 00:02:31,110
Kiss your own lips.

13
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:33,651
Go on.

14
00:02:37,195 --> 00:02:37,944
Again.

15
00:02:40,528 --> 00:02:43,862
Think it's me you're kissing
and you like it.

16
00:02:43,945 --> 00:02:46,571
Rub your cock against the glass.

17
00:02:49,905 --> 00:02:51,155
More.

18
00:02:52,988 --> 00:02:55,654
You love it... that's right.

19
00:02:56,071 --> 00:02:58,155
Now go back to the bed.

20
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:07,448
Caress yourself with your fingertips,
wherever you like.

21
00:03:11,157 --> 00:03:14,948
Take your cock and caress it
over your pants.

22
00:03:15,366 --> 00:03:17,200
Do it for real.

23
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:21,241
You should be getting randy.

24
00:03:21,824 --> 00:03:24,116
Take your underpants off.

25
00:03:25,491 --> 00:03:26,741
Take them off.

26
00:03:36,534 --> 00:03:38,409
Turn round.

27
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:41,410
Support yourself on your knees.

28
00:03:43,118 --> 00:03:45,578
Touch your buttocks.

29
00:03:47,119 --> 00:03:51,286
Not your legs,
between your buttocks.

30
00:03:53,078 --> 00:03:54,328
That's it.

31
00:03:55,661 --> 00:03:57,788
You're getting randy.

32
00:04:02,538 --> 00:04:05,080
Now... ask me to fuck you.

33
00:04:06,954 --> 00:04:09,498
Don't look at me.
I'm not over here.

34
00:04:09,539 --> 00:04:14,998
I'm next to you and you want me to
fuck you. Come on, ask me to.

35
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:19,248
- But didn't we...?
- Just ask me.

36
00:04:19,456 --> 00:04:21,623
Come on, don't be afraid.

37
00:04:22,248 --> 00:04:23,456
Just say it.

38
00:04:26,248 --> 00:04:27,374
Fuck me.

39
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:28,957
Fuck me.

40
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:34,917
I want you to feel me inside you.

41
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:38,876
I want you to enjoy it.

42
00:04:41,501 --> 00:04:42,958
Go on, don't stop.

43
00:04:45,335 --> 00:04:47,918
Tell me when you're going
to come.

44
00:04:50,251 --> 00:04:52,585
Do you feel me inside you?

45
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:54,293
Yes...

46
00:05:05,045 --> 00:05:08,545
- I think I'm coming.
- Me too.

47
00:05:24,714 --> 00:05:29,130
You did well. You may leave
after you shower.

48
00:05:44,841 --> 00:05:46,342
Freeze the image and "The End".

49
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:12,011
THE LAW OF DESIRE

50
00:06:21,387 --> 00:06:23,471
Hear the applause?

51
00:06:23,596 --> 00:06:26,596
It's a great film. Fantastic.

52
00:06:40,472 --> 00:06:41,556
Fuck me.

53
00:07:04,518 --> 00:07:06,850
I'll stay if you want me to.

54
00:07:06,934 --> 00:07:10,768
It's hot. Go to the seaside
and help your sister.

55
00:07:10,851 --> 00:07:13,643
- Will you visit me?
- I don't know.

56
00:07:13,893 --> 00:07:17,143
I must start rehearsals
straight away.

57
00:07:17,227 --> 00:07:20,810
- Take a week's rest.
- I don't need to rest.

58
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,769
This line is for you.

59
00:07:26,727 --> 00:07:30,854
Will you direct "The Human Voice"
for the stage?

60
00:07:30,937 --> 00:07:33,104
What other plans do you have?

61
00:07:33,145 --> 00:07:35,437
Right now, to get drunk...

62
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,938
...and get high.

63
00:07:38,729 --> 00:07:40,230
And you, Tina?

64
00:07:40,313 --> 00:07:44,522
I have theatre, film and TV offers,
and even a soap.

65
00:07:44,605 --> 00:07:48,105
But I can't talk till
the contracts are signed.

66
00:07:48,188 --> 00:07:49,480
Hey, Tina!

67
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:51,773
Don't take my double chin.

68
00:07:53,022 --> 00:07:55,356
Is it true you've become
a lesbian?

69
00:07:57,524 --> 00:08:00,440
With men like you, even I
would be a lesbian.

70
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:04,983
- And so would you, I guess.
- We already are.

71
00:08:06,899 --> 00:08:09,942
- Why can't they leave us alone?
- Forget it.

72
00:08:10,025 --> 00:08:11,900
- What happened?
- Nothing.

73
00:08:11,942 --> 00:08:14,276
Must go. I left the girl alone.

74
00:08:14,317 --> 00:08:17,900
- Any news from her mother?
- She's still in Tokyo.

75
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:21,234
I'm very proud of you.

76
00:08:23,151 --> 00:08:25,234
- Bye.
- Want a ride?

77
00:08:25,317 --> 00:08:28,068
No, you stay and enjoy
the party.

78
00:08:41,112 --> 00:08:43,237
I've seen all your films.

79
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:47,736
Today I saw all three showings of
"The Mussel's Paradigm".

80
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:48,903
You liked it?

81
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:52,654
The second time I did, but less than
the first time I saw "Remake".

82
00:08:52,696 --> 00:08:55,654
And the fifth time you saw
"Shitface"?

83
00:08:55,863 --> 00:08:58,947
Less than the third time
I saw "Halitosis".

84
00:08:59,114 --> 00:09:01,530
Which is your own favourite?

85
00:09:02,198 --> 00:09:06,656
I like making films,
not watching them.

86
00:09:09,907 --> 00:09:13,282
- What did you talk about?
- Cinema.

87
00:09:13,407 --> 00:09:16,115
- And what did he tell you?
- Things.

88
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,453
- Where are you going?
- Home.

89
00:09:53,536 --> 00:09:56,746
- Can I come with you?
- OK. Can you drive?

90
00:09:56,829 --> 00:09:59,120
Yes. Where's your car?

91
00:10:03,121 --> 00:10:06,748
- I'd like to steal this.
- A Vespino? What for?

92
00:10:06,997 --> 00:10:11,789
Belongs to a friend who's leaving
tomorrow. I'd like it as a fetish.

93
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:26,915
Got some coke?

94
00:10:28,249 --> 00:10:31,750
See if there's any left.
Come in.

95
00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:40,417
I'm a model, but I'd much rather
be in films.

96
00:10:41,709 --> 00:10:44,333
Excuse me, I'm going to throw up.

97
00:10:51,209 --> 00:10:53,168
<i>The Human Voice</i>

98
00:10:56,085 --> 00:10:58,169
They should ban premieres.

99
00:10:58,419 --> 00:11:02,545
- What's your next play?
- "The Human Voice".

100
00:11:02,628 --> 00:11:06,754
- Is there a role for me?
- It's a female monologue.

101
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,920
Can't a guy do it?

102
00:11:09,296 --> 00:11:13,587
No. Look, just go.
Sorry, I'm very tired.

103
00:11:14,503 --> 00:11:19,255
- Don't you want me to stay?
- No, not tonight.

104
00:12:03,093 --> 00:12:06,386
You didn't say goodbye
and it's my last night.

105
00:12:06,969 --> 00:12:10,136
I thought you had scored
with that girl.

106
00:12:10,219 --> 00:12:12,136
I would have told you.

107
00:12:12,636 --> 00:12:15,636
We can't get it together, Pablo.

108
00:12:16,637 --> 00:12:19,720
It's not your fault if
you don't love me.

109
00:12:20,553 --> 00:12:23,846
And it's not my fault
if I love you.

110
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:31,138
That's why I'm glad you're leaving.
I'll get over it sooner.

111
00:12:33,055 --> 00:12:35,598
I don't want you to get over it.

112
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:39,889
Let's not talk about it.
It's late, let's go to bed.

113
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,556
Promise you'll come and see me.

114
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:48,057
There's a beautiful beach and
a lighthouse to die for.

115
00:12:51,058 --> 00:12:54,058
- Still haven't fixed this?
- I will one day.

116
00:12:54,515 --> 00:12:59,225
I bet. I'll come back in September
and it still won't be fixed.

117
00:12:59,266 --> 00:13:03,060
That'll give you an excuse
to come back.

118
00:13:06,392 --> 00:13:08,434
Mind if we don't make love?

119
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:10,935
Don't worry, we won't do anything.

120
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:15,852
- And if you can't sleep?
- I'll take a pill.

121
00:13:16,393 --> 00:13:20,227
You take one, too.
I'll take a couple.

122
00:13:27,937 --> 00:13:32,146
- Is it OK with beer?
- After all you've taken tonight?

123
00:14:10,857 --> 00:14:13,442
- Very nice.
- Like it, don't you?

124
00:14:13,651 --> 00:14:15,317
Try it on.

125
00:14:17,108 --> 00:14:22,109
Amazing, it's your size.
You should buy it.

126
00:14:22,151 --> 00:14:25,568
- I've no money.
- Pay me tomorrow.

127
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:27,777
I'm going on holiday.

128
00:14:27,819 --> 00:14:32,028
Take it. When you come back,
bring me what you have.

129
00:14:32,111 --> 00:14:34,903
- Thanks. See you.
- God bless.

130
00:14:34,945 --> 00:14:37,486
What would you ask from
the loved one?

131
00:14:41,736 --> 00:14:46,529
Not to accompany me to parties,
wait at home for the gossip.

132
00:14:46,695 --> 00:14:48,362
Let me type in peace.

133
00:14:48,446 --> 00:14:51,946
Read the same books,
know about medicine...

134
00:14:52,862 --> 00:14:56,614
<i>...law, plumbing, electricity...</i>

135
00:14:56,656 --> 00:14:58,988
In short, to adore me.

136
00:14:59,072 --> 00:15:04,156
Not to nag me, and...
to accept I'm useless.

137
00:15:04,323 --> 00:15:06,864
Anyone would do that for you.

138
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,156
Don't be so sure.

139
00:15:08,406 --> 00:15:10,781
- Bet they would.
- Don't be so sure.

140
00:15:13,074 --> 00:15:18,242
Tell me, what do you most
love and hate in love?

141
00:15:18,283 --> 00:15:19,407
Same thing.

142
00:15:19,825 --> 00:15:23,407
<i>Love absorbs you
24 hours a day.</i>

143
00:15:23,616 --> 00:15:26,118
<i>You can't concentrate.</i>

144
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,534
That's what I most love
and hate.

145
00:15:29,117 --> 00:15:30,368
Really?

146
00:15:43,327 --> 00:15:48,036
<i>Dear Pablo, this is the lighthouse.
It'd make a wonderful location.</i>

147
00:15:48,161 --> 00:15:49,620
<i>I come here at dawn.</i>

148
00:15:49,828 --> 00:15:52,869
<i>How are you? Write to me.</i>

149
00:15:53,496 --> 00:15:56,329
<i>Big kiss, Juan</i>

150
00:15:57,121 --> 00:16:00,080
<i>Dear Juan, I got your letter.</i>

151
00:16:00,163 --> 00:16:04,538
<i>It's nice, but not what I expected.
I'll send you a typed letter.</i>

152
00:16:04,579 --> 00:16:08,788
<i>Please sign it and
send it back.</i>

153
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:11,956
<i>I long for you as ever. Pablo</i>

154
00:16:13,081 --> 00:16:15,455
How did the interview go?

155
00:16:15,497 --> 00:16:19,331
Terrible. Know what they offered
me? A porno movie... with her.

156
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:24,416
I kept my cool. Said I was too old
to show my arse. Bastards!

157
00:16:24,457 --> 00:16:28,999
- Nothing wrong with your arse.
- I use it less than you, that's why.

158
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:34,749
- You can be so crude, darling.
- Sorry, Pablo. I'm sick of it all.

159
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:38,375
- What would you like to drink?
- Coca-Cola.

160
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:41,376
Come outside.

161
00:16:43,959 --> 00:16:49,085
Be patient, Ada. She can be rude,
but she doesn't mean it.

162
00:16:49,127 --> 00:16:51,877
She got a letter from my mum.

163
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:56,169
Didn't let me read it, but I think
mum's staying longer in Tokyo.

164
00:16:57,210 --> 00:17:01,169
Slagging me off?
The sink's full of dishes.

165
00:17:01,211 --> 00:17:03,753
The cleaner comes tomorrow.

166
00:17:03,795 --> 00:17:05,753
This looks like a junkie's house.

167
00:17:05,795 --> 00:17:08,837
- What's a junkie?
- Nothing, nosey!

168
00:17:08,878 --> 00:17:11,421
- What's a junkie?
- A sportsman.

169
00:17:11,879 --> 00:17:15,838
- Never heard of ice junkie?
- That's hockey.

170
00:17:15,879 --> 00:17:20,171
Well, a junkie is...
a very messy person.

171
00:17:20,213 --> 00:17:22,464
Then I'm a bit of a junkie, too.

172
00:17:22,506 --> 00:17:24,880
Silly! Let me talk to Tina.

173
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:33,965
Her mother is staying in Tokyo
with some photographer.

174
00:17:34,548 --> 00:17:36,589
What are you going to do?

175
00:17:37,173 --> 00:17:39,716
Cry till I run out of tears.

176
00:17:43,966 --> 00:17:49,842
<i>I'll send you a typed letter.
Please sign it and send it back.</i>

177
00:17:49,925 --> 00:17:52,634
<i>I long for you as ever. Pablo</i>

178
00:17:52,718 --> 00:17:54,801
<i>Sado-masochist comic book.</i>

179
00:17:54,884 --> 00:17:57,176
What will you do with Ada?

180
00:17:57,593 --> 00:18:00,635
First she must finish school.

181
00:18:00,884 --> 00:18:02,552
And then...

182
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:06,884
...I'll have to keep her.
She hates her grandparents.

183
00:18:07,218 --> 00:18:11,052
- Want me to do the ironing?
- No, let the cleaner do it.

184
00:18:11,094 --> 00:18:14,845
- What's this, Ada?
- A comic. Can I have it?

185
00:18:14,886 --> 00:18:18,720
No, you've got to study.
Her grades are appalling.

186
00:18:19,178 --> 00:18:24,305
You like the harmonica? You can
have that, but promise you'll study.

187
00:18:24,345 --> 00:18:27,471
- I can't concentrate.
- Why's that?

188
00:18:27,555 --> 00:18:29,388
She's in love with you.

189
00:18:33,346 --> 00:18:34,597
It's a loan.

190
00:18:34,638 --> 00:18:37,806
- You promised not to tell.
- Shut up.

191
00:18:37,889 --> 00:18:40,472
We're off, you've a lot to do.

192
00:18:40,556 --> 00:18:43,765
- You've two more mouths to feed.
- Three.

193
00:18:44,348 --> 00:18:48,181
If you get bored, give me a call.
Bye now. - Bye.

194
00:18:48,473 --> 00:18:50,099
Thank you, darling.

195
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:57,392
<i>I didn't leave to forget you.</i>

196
00:18:57,475 --> 00:19:01,725
<i>If I ever did, as you said I should,
I'd end up empty inside.</i>

197
00:19:02,267 --> 00:19:05,225
<i>Tell me what you're up to.
What books you're reading.</i>

198
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:10,809
<i>What films you've seen. What records
you've bought. Have you got a cold?</i>

199
00:19:11,018 --> 00:19:13,977
<i>I want to share everything
with you.</i>

200
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:19,686
<i>Except if you've met someone
you fancy. I couldn't share that.</i>

201
00:19:19,936 --> 00:19:24,061
<i>I want to see you. You decide when.
I adore you.</i>

202
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:33,353
- Pablo is in love.
- With you?

203
00:19:33,437 --> 00:19:34,604
I doubt it.

204
00:19:34,687 --> 00:19:37,563
- He could be your father.
- If only!

205
00:19:37,646 --> 00:19:39,730
Forget it, he's very selfish.

206
00:19:39,812 --> 00:19:43,688
Selfish? He gave us a cheque
and a harmonica.

207
00:19:43,897 --> 00:19:45,564
I don't mean that.

208
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:49,564
Look, Ada!
Ramiro de Maeztu School.

209
00:19:49,814 --> 00:19:52,814
127, Serrano Street.

210
00:19:53,731 --> 00:19:56,024
I studied here as a child.

211
00:19:56,065 --> 00:19:59,024
Want to go inside the chapel?

212
00:19:59,065 --> 00:20:01,565
They still haven't fixed the gap.

213
00:20:04,565 --> 00:20:07,941
The times I must have
jerked off in here.

214
00:20:23,026 --> 00:20:26,902
<i>O Lady, more pure than a lily
and a rose.</i>

215
00:20:28,985 --> 00:20:34,444
<i>O Mother, more beautiful
than the glowing sun.</i>

216
00:20:35,153 --> 00:20:39,736
<i>Attend to my prayer,
listen to my song.</i>

217
00:20:39,819 --> 00:20:44,112
<i>Wipe away my tears
of bitter pain.</i>

218
00:20:44,321 --> 00:20:48,779
<i>Attend to my prayer,
listen to my song.</i>

219
00:20:48,905 --> 00:20:53,530
<i>Wipe away my tears
of bitter pain.</i>

220
00:20:55,989 --> 00:20:58,864
I was a soloist when I was young.

221
00:20:58,989 --> 00:21:02,197
It's the only thing I miss
from that time.

222
00:21:03,197 --> 00:21:07,864
You remind me of an old pupil.
He used to sing in the choir, too.

223
00:21:07,989 --> 00:21:11,115
Father Constantino, it's me.

224
00:21:12,823 --> 00:21:15,907
You? It can't be.

225
00:21:16,115 --> 00:21:17,575
Yes, it can.

226
00:21:17,741 --> 00:21:19,366
You've changed so much.

227
00:21:20,783 --> 00:21:24,700
Not really. I'm still the same
deep down.

228
00:21:24,742 --> 00:21:28,825
- And that girl?
- She's... my daughter.

229
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:31,658
Are you married?

230
00:21:31,867 --> 00:21:35,409
No, I'm condemned to solitude.

231
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:38,618
You can never say that.

232
00:21:38,868 --> 00:21:42,619
I can. There have been
only two men in my life.

233
00:21:42,869 --> 00:21:43,952
One was you...

234
00:21:44,202 --> 00:21:47,953
...my spiritual mentor.
The other was my father.

235
00:21:48,161 --> 00:21:49,703
Both abandoned me.

236
00:21:49,912 --> 00:21:51,579
I don't trust any other.

237
00:21:51,829 --> 00:21:55,454
Put your trust in God.
He'll never abandon you.

238
00:21:56,995 --> 00:21:59,120
Maybe you're right.

239
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:04,080
I'd like to sing in
the choir again.

240
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:06,538
- Not here, please.
- Why not?

241
00:22:06,746 --> 00:22:11,081
If it's God you're after,
go to any church.

242
00:22:11,164 --> 00:22:12,955
He's in all of them.

243
00:22:13,164 --> 00:22:15,748
But my memories are here.

244
00:22:16,664 --> 00:22:19,040
Banish them, as I have done.

245
00:22:19,248 --> 00:22:22,749
My memories are all I have left.

246
00:22:40,751 --> 00:22:41,958
What's that?

247
00:22:42,084 --> 00:22:45,834
The May Cross. It gives us solace,
remember?

248
00:22:45,918 --> 00:22:48,418
Get a man, it's more hygienic.

249
00:22:48,502 --> 00:22:52,627
No men, or women. Let's not talk
about it, not in front of her.

250
00:22:52,752 --> 00:22:56,211
Need any help? What's wrong?
Are you angry with me?

251
00:22:56,252 --> 00:23:00,919
No, she's taken a vow of obedience,
chastity and silence.

252
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,878
Well, not obedience.

253
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:07,253
And the silence is driving me mad.

254
00:23:09,462 --> 00:23:10,670
"Chas...

255
00:23:11,796 --> 00:23:12,921
"... ti...

256
00:23:13,838 --> 00:23:15,005
"... ty...

257
00:23:15,047 --> 00:23:16,421
"No!"

258
00:23:16,546 --> 00:23:18,838
That's a relief!

259
00:23:20,172 --> 00:23:23,089
She's taking First Communion.

260
00:23:23,172 --> 00:23:28,464
Are you? I'll get you a dress
worthy of a saint.

261
00:23:30,547 --> 00:23:33,839
I'm starting to rehearse
"The Human Voice".

262
00:23:33,964 --> 00:23:36,340
- And who's the lucky girl?
- You, I hope.

263
00:23:38,341 --> 00:23:40,049
It worked!

264
00:23:41,508 --> 00:23:46,258
We asked the Virgin for work.
I'll take another vow.

265
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:48,883
Don't be greedy. Sit down, love.

266
00:23:48,926 --> 00:23:52,759
You serious? You're not
taking pity on me?

267
00:23:54,259 --> 00:23:57,425
Can I be in it?
I asked for work too.

268
00:23:57,634 --> 00:24:00,802
We'll see. But it'll be
hard for you.

269
00:24:00,885 --> 00:24:02,301
Why?

270
00:24:02,385 --> 00:24:06,218
The show will bring you
painful memories.

271
00:24:06,301 --> 00:24:09,844
Better than showing my arse
in a nightclub.

272
00:24:09,886 --> 00:24:11,427
Much better.

273
00:24:11,928 --> 00:24:15,470
- Is it because I'm your sister?
- No way!

274
00:24:15,512 --> 00:24:17,220
Or because I'm broke?

275
00:24:21,845 --> 00:24:25,262
Eat up, love. I'll never
eat again.

276
00:24:25,304 --> 00:24:27,429
A face-lift!

277
00:24:27,471 --> 00:24:31,514
I can't do it, Pablo.

278
00:24:32,305 --> 00:24:37,264
I won't spoil the show for you.
My skin is awful for that role.

279
00:24:37,973 --> 00:24:40,472
What's so funny, sweetie?

280
00:24:48,058 --> 00:24:51,683
<i>When her lover left her,
Laura ran after him.</i>

281
00:24:51,766 --> 00:24:53,849
<i>She fell and broke her ankle.</i>

282
00:24:53,933 --> 00:24:58,516
<i>Then cut her leg off saying she had
gangrene, to make him feel guilty.</i>

283
00:24:58,683 --> 00:25:03,308
<i>But her thirst for revenge
remained unquenched.</i>

284
00:25:13,394 --> 00:25:16,851
<i>Dear Pablo, I didn't leave
to forget you.</i>

285
00:25:16,977 --> 00:25:20,519
<i>If I ever did, as you said I should.
I'd end up empty inside.</i>

286
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:24,852
<i>Tell me what you're up to.
What books you're reading.</i>

287
00:25:24,894 --> 00:25:28,435
<i>Have you got a cold?
Given up snow?</i>

288
00:25:29,562 --> 00:25:32,062
<i>I want to share everything
with you.</i>

289
00:25:33,645 --> 00:25:36,563
Got an extra ticket for the show?

290
00:25:42,855 --> 00:25:46,606
- Got any spare tickets?
- No, sorry.

291
00:25:49,897 --> 00:25:53,814
Excuse me, sir. Got any
spare tickets?

292
00:26:12,483 --> 00:26:14,942
I don't suppose you've got
a ticket?

293
00:26:37,486 --> 00:26:40,362
I'm off, it's too hot in here.

294
00:26:40,529 --> 00:26:44,237
We're staying, it's been
a tough night.

295
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:47,029
OK, but don't get drunk.

296
00:26:47,696 --> 00:26:49,488
See you tomorrow.

297
00:26:58,405 --> 00:27:00,905
You're Pablo Quintero, aren't you?

298
00:27:03,073 --> 00:27:06,322
- I really wanted to talk to you.
- Well, here I am.

299
00:27:06,531 --> 00:27:10,323
I'm going home.
Want to come with me?

300
00:27:11,157 --> 00:27:13,490
I don't sleep with men.

301
00:27:15,199 --> 00:27:17,658
Bye, then. Nice to meet you.

302
00:27:19,908 --> 00:27:21,158
You win.

303
00:27:21,241 --> 00:27:25,283
- I'm going with you.
- This isn't a contest.

304
00:27:25,616 --> 00:27:30,825
It is, and I've just lost.
But I don't care, come on.

305
00:27:37,452 --> 00:27:38,702
I couldn't get a ticket.

306
00:27:39,494 --> 00:27:43,119
I'll leave one at the box office
tomorrow.

307
00:27:47,287 --> 00:27:51,120
- Leave that. Want a beer?
- OK.

308
00:27:52,411 --> 00:27:54,619
Don't touch anything.

309
00:28:00,328 --> 00:28:01,997
Laura P.

310
00:28:04,538 --> 00:28:06,246
Who is Laura P.?

311
00:28:06,288 --> 00:28:10,581
The lead in my next film.
Don't touch, they're just notes.

312
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:16,789
Is it true your sister
is a transsexual?

313
00:28:18,081 --> 00:28:20,498
What's it to you?

314
00:28:23,873 --> 00:28:26,707
I'll help you tidy up.

315
00:28:53,793 --> 00:28:56,753
- You do this often?
- All the time.

316
00:28:56,918 --> 00:29:01,003
It's a miracle the place
hasn't caught fire yet.

317
00:29:01,336 --> 00:29:03,253
Cool it, OK?

318
00:29:04,295 --> 00:29:07,879
You don't kiss as if you're
unblocking the sink.

319
00:29:07,962 --> 00:29:11,546
- Then you teach me how.
- With pleasure.

320
00:29:26,089 --> 00:29:27,797
How was that?

321
00:29:44,883 --> 00:29:48,841
Listen, you don't have any
venereal diseases?

322
00:29:49,924 --> 00:29:52,300
Why do you ask me that now?

323
00:29:52,633 --> 00:29:54,800
You're so promiscuous...

324
00:29:55,633 --> 00:29:58,426
No. Don't worry.

325
00:29:58,842 --> 00:30:03,218
I've never had anything,
not even crabs.

326
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:07,345
I hate that kind of disease.

327
00:30:08,427 --> 00:30:11,386
Look, why don't we just
forget it?

328
00:30:12,303 --> 00:30:16,054
- You want to?
- If you keep asking questions, yes.

329
00:30:16,137 --> 00:30:19,470
I won't ask anything else,
I promise.

330
00:30:20,845 --> 00:30:24,929
Listen... one last question.
Last one.

331
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:27,387
Only one, OK?

332
00:30:29,221 --> 00:30:31,680
You want to fuck me, don't you?

333
00:30:31,805 --> 00:30:35,097
Ever since I saw you
at the disco.

334
00:30:37,805 --> 00:30:40,223
I've never done it before.

335
00:31:43,438 --> 00:31:45,022
<i>Dear Pablo,</i>

336
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:48,980
<i>Tell me what you're up to.
What books you're reading.</i>

337
00:31:49,105 --> 00:31:53,106
<i>What films you've seen.
Given up snow?</i>

338
00:31:53,814 --> 00:31:57,607
<i>I want to share everything
with you.</i>

339
00:31:58,232 --> 00:32:03,899
<i>Except if you've met someone
you fancy. I coudn't share that.</i>

340
00:32:03,982 --> 00:32:05,816
<i>I adore you. Juan</i>

341
00:32:06,233 --> 00:32:07,399
Shit!

342
00:32:19,442 --> 00:32:21,360
You're a pig.

343
00:32:21,401 --> 00:32:26,361
If I were 16, I'd report you
for being a child molester.

344
00:32:54,946 --> 00:32:57,572
- Who is it?
- Antonio.

345
00:33:00,696 --> 00:33:02,490
What a surprise!

346
00:33:04,697 --> 00:33:06,989
Come in, don't be shy.

347
00:33:07,407 --> 00:33:11,241
I wanted to see you
before I go.

348
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:16,115
You shouldn't provoke
a child molester.

349
00:33:25,034 --> 00:33:26,283
Let's go to bed.

350
00:34:14,914 --> 00:34:18,248
- Good morning! About time.
- Don't shout.

351
00:34:18,414 --> 00:34:22,164
- I fixed the switch in the hall.
- So I see. Thanks.

352
00:34:22,289 --> 00:34:27,249
You're hopeless. Someone
should take care of you.

353
00:34:27,457 --> 00:34:29,791
I've heard that one before.

354
00:34:30,708 --> 00:34:35,334
When this dries, one coat of paint
and it'll be as good as new.

355
00:34:35,418 --> 00:34:39,667
You've done enough for today.
Don't worry about it.

356
00:34:41,042 --> 00:34:45,959
<i>Antonio, darling. You may think so,
but I'm not in love with you.</i>

357
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,376
<i>I'm touched by your tenderness.
But don't fall in love with me.</i>

358
00:34:50,418 --> 00:34:54,627
<i>I'm too selfish, I coudn't share
my life. Thank you and good luck.</i>

359
00:35:00,795 --> 00:35:03,920
- Pablo, wake up.
- What time is your train?

360
00:35:03,962 --> 00:35:07,713
- In two hours.
- Then let me sleep a bit more.

361
00:35:07,754 --> 00:35:12,295
- A massage will wake you.
- Stop it, I'm getting up.

362
00:35:15,170 --> 00:35:18,505
You need a shower.
Get into the bathroom.

363
00:35:18,714 --> 00:35:22,464
I don't want you going out
with other guys.

364
00:35:23,423 --> 00:35:26,172
And stop taking coke.

365
00:35:27,089 --> 00:35:32,298
When I tell you, you'll come and
see me. We'll go sailing together.

366
00:35:33,423 --> 00:35:35,757
You need a healthier life.

367
00:35:35,924 --> 00:35:38,674
Aren't you a bit reactionary?

368
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:41,382
And quite right, too.

369
00:35:42,507 --> 00:35:46,174
Who is the boy in the letter?
That Juan?

370
00:35:49,091 --> 00:35:50,842
You've read it?

371
00:35:52,718 --> 00:35:54,676
How dare you?

372
00:35:55,676 --> 00:35:59,635
I can't help it. I want to know
everything about you.

373
00:36:00,427 --> 00:36:02,135
Don't do it again.

374
00:36:08,136 --> 00:36:10,594
He seems very much in love
with you.

375
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:14,844
He isn't. That letter is a joke.

376
00:36:15,095 --> 00:36:19,429
Love is never a joke. I hope
you're not in love with him.

377
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:21,304
Let's drop it, OK?

378
00:36:23,762 --> 00:36:26,805
Don't lie to me, Pablo.
Don't cheat on me.

379
00:36:26,888 --> 00:36:32,097
Hold on! I never promised anything.
I told you not to trust me.

380
00:36:32,179 --> 00:36:34,931
Stop pretending.
I'm not a press.

381
00:36:35,056 --> 00:36:39,015
You love me, I can tell.
But you play at being frivolous.

382
00:36:39,139 --> 00:36:40,806
I am frivolous.

383
00:36:40,931 --> 00:36:45,432
- You're screaming for affection.
- Maybe. But not at any price.

384
00:36:48,889 --> 00:36:51,057
You're better than you think.

385
00:36:51,182 --> 00:36:55,182
But you don't lead a healthy life.
I'll take care of that.

386
00:36:55,266 --> 00:37:00,058
Since I can't get you to listen,
I've written you a letter.

387
00:37:00,225 --> 00:37:03,101
Ah, yes, the letter.
I tore it up.

388
00:37:03,934 --> 00:37:05,184
I did read it.

389
00:37:05,934 --> 00:37:08,392
But you shoudn't have written it.

390
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:11,976
But that's in the past.
Breakfast?

391
00:37:12,392 --> 00:37:14,852
I'll write when I get there.

392
00:37:15,602 --> 00:37:19,518
- Promise, you'll write back.
- All right.

393
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:22,603
I don't want anyone to know
about us.

394
00:37:23,061 --> 00:37:26,395
Listen, if you've been spying
on me...

395
00:37:26,604 --> 00:37:30,645
...which seems likely, you'll know
I never talk about my private life.

396
00:37:34,313 --> 00:37:39,854
I'm thinking of my family. They don't
read my letters, but best be cautious.

397
00:37:41,521 --> 00:37:43,355
Write under a girl's name.

398
00:37:45,355 --> 00:37:48,439
So my mother doesn't know
you're a guy. Get it?

399
00:37:48,688 --> 00:37:49,772
Come off it, man.

400
00:37:49,856 --> 00:37:54,148
- I'm sure she won't read them.
- She won't read what?

401
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:56,732
- The letters.
- What letters?

402
00:37:56,773 --> 00:37:57,815
Yours.

403
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:04,941
Just in case. My mother is German
and likes being a spy.

404
00:38:08,649 --> 00:38:12,274
Take care, and have a good trip.

405
00:38:15,317 --> 00:38:17,859
Hurry, you'll miss your train.

406
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,372
Hello?

407
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:19,248
Mum, you're back!

408
00:40:19,706 --> 00:40:21,456
Ada, my darling.

409
00:40:23,832 --> 00:40:25,916
I've missed you so much.

410
00:40:26,041 --> 00:40:28,583
Mind my make-up.
I'm on at the end.

411
00:40:28,708 --> 00:40:30,875
Aren't you glad to see me?

412
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,625
Yes, you look lovely.

413
00:40:34,166 --> 00:40:38,291
- What's this?
- My First Communion dress.

414
00:40:38,374 --> 00:40:42,542
I told you not to, Ada.
You and I are atheists.

415
00:40:43,084 --> 00:40:44,958
Have you forgotten?

416
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,168
You may be an atheist, but Tina
and I are great believers.

417
00:40:49,251 --> 00:40:51,336
We have a May Cross at home.

418
00:40:51,419 --> 00:40:53,002
But it's June!

419
00:40:53,086 --> 00:40:56,419
We've found a Virgin
who works miracles.

420
00:40:56,461 --> 00:40:57,711
You two are bonkers.

421
00:40:57,753 --> 00:41:03,711
Have you seen Tina? - Yes.
- She's a great actress, and so am I.

422
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:08,628
- Ada, come here, we need to talk.
- We are talking.

423
00:41:08,753 --> 00:41:12,004
Don't be stubborn. Sit down.

424
00:41:12,129 --> 00:41:14,378
Look at these filthy hands.

425
00:41:14,504 --> 00:41:17,338
I've come for you.
I live in Milan now.

426
00:41:17,463 --> 00:41:21,255
It's a beautiful industrial city.
You'll love it.

427
00:41:21,381 --> 00:41:25,798
I don't speak Italian, and
I don't care about industry.

428
00:41:25,922 --> 00:41:30,590
Anyway, you'll go off. I'm staying
with Tina, she won't leave me.

429
00:41:30,673 --> 00:41:34,632
- How do you know?
- She doesn't like men like you do.

430
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:39,591
Ada, this time I've found
what I was looking for.

431
00:41:39,673 --> 00:41:41,924
I don't want to go with you.

432
00:41:46,175 --> 00:41:48,883
This girl drives me crazy.

433
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:51,509
I've broken two nails.

434
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:59,968
Yes, my love. I know I shoudn't
get my hopes up.

435
00:42:00,052 --> 00:42:03,843
But until now, whenever
we've had problems...

436
00:42:03,885 --> 00:42:07,301
...we've always talked things
through.

437
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:10,177
And made up with a simple glance.

438
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:18,178
But it's not the same on the phone.
On the phone it's final.

439
00:42:18,428 --> 00:42:20,221
Wait!

440
00:42:20,513 --> 00:42:24,596
Me? Why would I think
you want to hang up?

441
00:42:24,970 --> 00:42:27,389
That would be too cruel.

442
00:42:27,888 --> 00:42:31,513
And you... have never been cruel.

443
00:42:40,931 --> 00:42:42,932
How silly of me.

444
00:42:43,473 --> 00:42:46,765
I was about to say, until now.

445
00:42:46,807 --> 00:42:50,599
Yes, it'd be better
if you hang up.

446
00:42:52,016 --> 00:42:54,057
Goodbye, my love.

447
00:42:54,850 --> 00:42:58,058
Yes, I'll be brave. I will!

448
00:42:58,933 --> 00:43:03,183
Now hurry and hang up, please.
Hang up, please.

449
00:43:09,226 --> 00:43:11,767
I love you more than my own life.

450
00:43:16,685 --> 00:43:18,769
More than my own life.

451
00:44:25,986 --> 00:44:28,027
Aren't you hungry?

452
00:44:29,277 --> 00:44:31,193
It's disgusting.

453
00:44:38,944 --> 00:44:43,070
God, it's hot! How can you
stand that jacket?

454
00:45:20,991 --> 00:45:25,200
Go on, don't by shy.
Hose me down!

455
00:45:28,075 --> 00:45:29,825
It's so hot!

456
00:45:40,743 --> 00:45:43,535
I can't take the heat tonight.

457
00:45:49,953 --> 00:45:52,996
Come on, no more hydrotherapy.

458
00:45:54,871 --> 00:45:59,912
That was amazing! I've always
dreamt of doing that.

459
00:45:59,996 --> 00:46:05,204
I didn't think it'd be so powerful,
but it was great.

460
00:46:05,746 --> 00:46:07,496
Let's get drunk.

461
00:46:11,913 --> 00:46:14,122
You two were great tonight.

462
00:46:14,164 --> 00:46:17,665
You were bloody awful,
especially you.

463
00:46:17,706 --> 00:46:19,873
You really overacted.

464
00:46:19,914 --> 00:46:23,332
- Sorry, I'm not a machine.
- Neither am I.

465
00:46:43,584 --> 00:46:45,918
I'm a drug addict too, you know.

466
00:46:46,126 --> 00:46:49,460
Don't ever say I overacted
in front of other people.

467
00:46:49,544 --> 00:46:50,794
It's the truth.

468
00:46:50,878 --> 00:46:54,711
- But no one needs to know.
- You're right, I'm sorry.

469
00:47:01,670 --> 00:47:03,878
So you don't like my acting?

470
00:47:03,961 --> 00:47:08,504
Don't be a drag. I like you and the
public likes you, can't you tell?

471
00:47:08,628 --> 00:47:12,045
- Yes, but...
- But what? You should be happy.

472
00:47:12,171 --> 00:47:15,963
I am, but the show gets me down
sometimes.

473
00:47:16,088 --> 00:47:17,338
I warned you.

474
00:47:17,463 --> 00:47:19,256
I love all the drama.

475
00:47:20,714 --> 00:47:23,922
All the crying and talking
on the phone.

476
00:47:24,047 --> 00:47:27,213
What I hate is having to
dress like a slob.

477
00:47:30,338 --> 00:47:34,923
I shouldn't have said that.
You'll never give me work again.

478
00:47:35,048 --> 00:47:39,340
You're wrong. You're the lead
in my next film.

479
00:47:40,632 --> 00:47:41,674
More coke!

480
00:47:43,091 --> 00:47:47,216
With your paranoia, I'd better
warn you before you read it.

481
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:51,259
- So you don't get cross.
- Why? What's the film about?

482
00:47:51,342 --> 00:47:54,342
See? You're pissed off already.

483
00:47:54,509 --> 00:47:57,717
- Tell me, or I really will be.
- Tomorrow.

484
00:47:58,092 --> 00:48:02,551
Look, it's not that the role
is inspired by you.

485
00:48:02,676 --> 00:48:06,802
But it has... a certain affinity.
I need another line.

486
00:48:08,136 --> 00:48:10,178
How much of an affinity?

487
00:48:10,302 --> 00:48:13,012
Regarding your problems with men.

488
00:48:13,137 --> 00:48:18,179
I don't have any problems with men.
They mean nothing to me any more.

489
00:48:18,387 --> 00:48:20,679
And that's not a problem?

490
00:48:20,804 --> 00:48:25,679
- You think I'm a freak, too?
- I didn't say that.

491
00:48:25,804 --> 00:48:29,304
Talk about your own problems
and leave me alone.

492
00:48:29,847 --> 00:48:31,096
Will you listen?

493
00:48:31,263 --> 00:48:37,056
Leave my life out of it. I may be
ridiculous, but I have my self-respect.

494
00:48:37,139 --> 00:48:40,639
- Who says you're ridiculous?
- I know I am.

495
00:48:40,722 --> 00:48:44,349
- Will you listen to me?
- OK, I will.

496
00:48:45,307 --> 00:48:48,682
My problems with men mean more
than a storyline.

497
00:48:48,766 --> 00:48:53,641
No one's going to play with them.
Get out of here!

498
00:48:53,807 --> 00:48:57,641
- No one's playing with them.
- They're mine, you hear?

499
00:48:57,807 --> 00:49:00,184
You keep them, if it
makes you happy.

500
00:49:00,308 --> 00:49:05,142
It doesn't, you bastard.
But I've paid for my failures.

501
00:49:05,267 --> 00:49:07,434
And now they're all I've got.

502
00:49:14,226 --> 00:49:15,477
Your milk.

503
00:49:22,852 --> 00:49:26,144
Will I have tits like yours
one day?

504
00:49:26,186 --> 00:49:30,020
Of course you will. At your age,
I was as flat as a board.

505
00:49:30,562 --> 00:49:33,103
Does Pablo like tits?

506
00:49:33,187 --> 00:49:36,729
I don't know. Some men
don't appreciate them.

507
00:49:36,812 --> 00:49:39,729
No more questions.
Drink your milk.

508
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:43,563
She took everything, didn't she?

509
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:46,606
Good. We'll have more room now.

510
00:49:47,356 --> 00:49:52,189
I'll never leave you, Tina. I told
her that and she slapped me.

511
00:49:52,230 --> 00:49:55,689
Bitch! But never forget
she's your mother.

512
00:49:55,731 --> 00:49:59,315
- I love you.
- How much?

513
00:49:59,815 --> 00:50:04,608
- Can I sleep with you tonight?
- Of course, sweetheart.

514
00:50:04,650 --> 00:50:07,191
Can I ask the Virgin
something first?

515
00:50:07,691 --> 00:50:12,525
At this hour? The poor Virgin
must be sick of it. Go on, then.

516
00:50:16,443 --> 00:50:18,734
- Morocco.
- Finished.

517
00:50:18,817 --> 00:50:20,485
What did you ask?

518
00:50:20,567 --> 00:50:22,984
That Pablo never leaves us
like mum did.

519
00:50:23,068 --> 00:50:25,567
Let's go to bed, sweetheart.

520
00:50:41,946 --> 00:50:44,153
Thank you, Virgin.

521
00:50:54,655 --> 00:50:56,405
God, it's hot!

522
00:50:56,614 --> 00:50:59,155
- Here.
- What is it?

523
00:50:59,447 --> 00:51:01,405
Photos of when we were kids.

524
00:51:01,614 --> 00:51:03,198
I thought I had them all.

525
00:51:03,448 --> 00:51:07,198
When you asked for them,
mum and I kept these.

526
00:51:08,115 --> 00:51:11,074
Do what you like with them.

527
00:51:12,324 --> 00:51:15,116
I want you to trust me, Tina.

528
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:22,533
I promised not to ask questions, and
I've kept my bargain over the years.

529
00:51:24,199 --> 00:51:26,367
But your past is part of mine.

530
00:51:28,116 --> 00:51:30,659
Don't take it out on me, Pablo.

531
00:51:30,909 --> 00:51:33,743
I'm very vulnerable,
and very imperfect.

532
00:52:10,789 --> 00:52:12,790
Hi, Pablo. It's Juan.

533
00:52:12,998 --> 00:52:16,081
Hello, Juan. How are you?

534
00:52:16,248 --> 00:52:20,081
Terrible. Why don't you
answer my letters?

535
00:52:20,123 --> 00:52:21,706
Because...

536
00:52:22,164 --> 00:52:26,290
...I'm trying to forget you. And
when you do that, you can't write.

537
00:52:27,290 --> 00:52:31,333
Pablo, I'll give you what you want,
but you must teach me how.

538
00:52:31,375 --> 00:52:33,208
You can't teach that.

539
00:52:34,625 --> 00:52:38,708
Give me another chance. Come to
see me so I can try.

540
00:52:38,792 --> 00:52:43,127
OK. I'll come and check
that lighthouse.

541
00:52:43,168 --> 00:52:47,417
You'll love it. Write to me,
I miss you so much.

542
00:52:47,459 --> 00:52:50,417
OK, I'll write to you now.

543
00:52:51,793 --> 00:52:55,502
Pablo... I love you.

544
00:53:02,128 --> 00:53:05,169
<i>Pablo, are you there?</i>

545
00:53:06,045 --> 00:53:10,003
<i>- Pick up the phone, I'm sick of this.
- Yes, I'm here.</i>

546
00:53:10,212 --> 00:53:12,963
I've been calling for days.

547
00:53:13,046 --> 00:53:16,838
I've been out. Did you get
my letters?

548
00:53:16,921 --> 00:53:20,171
Yes, and I don't like them.
I'm sick of Laura P.

549
00:53:20,296 --> 00:53:23,131
It was your idea to use
a girl's name.

550
00:53:23,256 --> 00:53:28,005
Well, I was wrong. You must
come and see me, Pablo.

551
00:53:28,506 --> 00:53:31,923
- Are you avoiding me?
- Antonio, I've told you...

552
00:53:32,132 --> 00:53:35,632
Must go. If you don't come,
I'll come to see you.

553
00:53:43,134 --> 00:53:45,842
<i>Antonio, I don't love you.</i>

554
00:53:46,008 --> 00:53:48,174
<i>I'm still in love with Juan.</i>

555
00:53:48,299 --> 00:53:52,425
<i>I won't come to see you.
I'm going to see Juan.</i>

556
00:53:52,634 --> 00:53:57,467
<i>Forget me. Dont fool yourself.
I never lied to you, Laura P.</i>

557
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:03,642
- Nearly done?
- Not quite.

558
00:55:03,767 --> 00:55:08,143
- You go, I'll clear up here.
- Thanks!

559
00:55:11,393 --> 00:55:13,852
But tomorrow it's your turn.

560
00:55:48,397 --> 00:55:49,855
It's closed.

561
00:55:50,273 --> 00:55:53,939
- But if you want something...
- A bottle of whisky.

562
00:55:55,023 --> 00:55:57,565
- What brand?
- This one.

563
00:55:58,065 --> 00:56:01,315
- You must be Juan, right?
- Yes, and who are you?

564
00:56:01,983 --> 00:56:04,191
I'm Pablo's friend.

565
00:56:06,232 --> 00:56:09,400
- Pablo is coming tomorrow.
- Not any more.

566
00:56:10,067 --> 00:56:12,233
He sent me to tell you.

567
00:56:14,317 --> 00:56:17,775
- Why doesn't he tell me himself?
- He doesn't want to see you.

568
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:23,484
- That's his shirt, isn't it?
- Yes, he gave it to me.

569
00:56:26,068 --> 00:56:27,943
You still love him?

570
00:56:28,027 --> 00:56:32,652
In my own way. But Pablo needs
more, and I was willing to give it.

571
00:56:32,736 --> 00:56:36,611
Don't bother. He's found what
he wanted in me.

572
00:56:38,237 --> 00:56:40,570
I wanted to show him
the lighthouse.

573
00:56:40,653 --> 00:56:43,570
I'll tell him all about it.

574
00:56:44,820 --> 00:56:46,904
Stop playing with the torch.

575
00:56:51,571 --> 00:56:53,071
Here, drink.

576
00:57:00,989 --> 00:57:04,323
I often come here to watch
the dawn.

577
00:57:12,449 --> 00:57:14,240
What are you doing?

578
00:57:14,365 --> 00:57:17,698
- You'd kiss him, wouldn't you?
- What's it to you?

579
00:57:19,616 --> 00:57:21,116
Leave me alone!

580
00:57:21,574 --> 00:57:24,950
- What the hell do you want?
- To possess you.

581
00:57:25,575 --> 00:57:26,575
You're crazy.

582
00:57:26,742 --> 00:57:30,035
I love Pablo. I want everything
that is his.

583
00:57:30,826 --> 00:57:34,409
I belong to no one. No one.

584
00:57:42,036 --> 00:57:45,327
Sorry, I'm a bit drunk.
I didn't mean to.

585
00:57:45,869 --> 00:57:50,077
I don't understand you.
I don't know what's going on.

586
00:58:10,289 --> 00:58:11,872
Let go of me!

587
00:59:27,590 --> 00:59:29,256
Are you Pablo Quintero?

588
00:59:30,757 --> 00:59:32,006
What's happened?

589
00:59:32,048 --> 00:59:35,882
He fell, or was pushed
over the cliff.

590
00:59:35,924 --> 00:59:39,216
Near the Trafalgar lighthouse?

591
00:59:39,257 --> 00:59:43,091
- You know the place?
- Juan sent me a photo.

592
00:59:46,383 --> 00:59:50,591
- Where were you last night?
- In the theatre with my sister.

593
00:59:50,633 --> 00:59:54,342
I left Madrid around 8
this morning.

594
00:59:54,384 --> 00:59:56,802
I suppose we can check it out.

595
00:59:58,135 --> 00:59:59,927
How well did you know Juan?

596
00:59:59,968 --> 01:00:02,259
We were good friends.

597
01:00:03,594 --> 01:00:07,844
- How good?
- We weren't lovers.

598
01:00:07,886 --> 01:00:13,010
- Is that clear?
- No, it isn't.

599
01:00:16,178 --> 01:00:19,720
- Juan loved you.
- How do you know?

600
01:00:19,803 --> 01:00:23,804
We grew up together.
He told me everything.

601
01:00:24,471 --> 01:00:28,055
Stay the night. You're in
no shape to travel.

602
01:00:28,097 --> 01:00:31,013
No, no, thanks. That's kind of you.

603
01:00:31,055 --> 01:00:34,555
I'm going to Jerez
to see a friend.

604
01:00:47,306 --> 01:00:48,807
Let's go to the cliffs.

605
01:00:49,724 --> 01:00:51,099
<i>Dear Juan,</i>

606
01:00:51,557 --> 01:00:54,099
<i>The more generous you are
with me...</i>

607
01:00:54,140 --> 01:01:00,100
<i>...the more I realise I've made you
do things against your will.</i>

608
01:01:00,141 --> 01:01:04,059
<i>I won't touch you again,
even if you ask me to.</i>

609
01:01:04,142 --> 01:01:07,685
<i>I want you to desire me,
even if you don't love me.</i>

610
01:01:07,726 --> 01:01:10,101
<i>But you can't force things.</i>

611
01:01:10,142 --> 01:01:14,060
<i>I want you to show me
the lighthouse at dawn...</i>

612
01:01:14,102 --> 01:01:17,893
<i>...and hear the waves
against the cliffs.</i>

613
01:01:17,935 --> 01:01:22,186
<i>I love you more than ever.
I can't help it, Pablo</i>

614
01:01:30,938 --> 01:01:33,980
It's like the shirt
he was wearing.

615
01:01:34,771 --> 01:01:38,145
Did you see if a pocket
was missing?

616
01:01:38,479 --> 01:01:39,729
Let's go after him.

617
01:01:52,939 --> 01:01:54,482
The pocket.

618
01:02:19,901 --> 01:02:21,859
What a mess!

619
01:02:31,319 --> 01:02:33,861
- Antonio?
- I'm in the bathroom.

620
01:02:36,653 --> 01:02:40,403
I'm practising for the
grape harvest.

621
01:02:41,069 --> 01:02:43,945
- Come with me?
- You go alone.

622
01:02:44,028 --> 01:02:47,821
Is something burning?
I can smell smoke.

623
01:02:47,904 --> 01:02:51,737
- It's a cigarette.
- But you don't smoke.

624
01:02:52,071 --> 01:02:55,446
It's not a joint, is it?
Open the door.

625
01:02:55,530 --> 01:02:56,989
What are you doing?

626
01:03:04,573 --> 01:03:06,073
Where were you last night?

627
01:03:06,573 --> 01:03:10,406
Nowhere. Stop shouting,
everyone can hear you.

628
01:03:10,447 --> 01:03:12,991
Let them, I'm in my own house.

629
01:03:19,116 --> 01:03:20,157
What do you want?

630
01:03:20,949 --> 01:03:26,450
- Sorry, I rang the bell.
- The maid's out.

631
01:03:27,992 --> 01:03:30,243
- Who are you?
- I'm Pablo.

632
01:03:30,993 --> 01:03:33,618
A friend of Laura's.

633
01:03:33,701 --> 01:03:36,034
Can't that woman leave us alone?

634
01:03:36,118 --> 01:03:39,617
Don't worry. She won't
bother you again.

635
01:03:48,744 --> 01:03:50,245
Remember me?

636
01:03:52,121 --> 01:03:53,662
Laura introduced us.

637
01:03:53,745 --> 01:03:57,579
Of course I remember.
You're the film director.

638
01:04:00,955 --> 01:04:02,997
You'll be late, mum.

639
01:04:03,204 --> 01:04:06,413
I'll open the side door for you.

640
01:04:06,663 --> 01:04:10,497
- Where were you last night?
- I didn't go out.

641
01:04:10,539 --> 01:04:14,122
- I heard the bike.
- Mum, you've got to help me.

642
01:04:14,164 --> 01:04:19,206
How can I? You don't tell me
anything. It's that slag's fault.

643
01:04:19,248 --> 01:04:22,915
- She was here last night.
- I knew something was wrong.

644
01:04:22,957 --> 01:04:27,041
And him? He's got a shirt
like yours.

645
01:04:27,125 --> 01:04:29,624
I never had a shirt like that, OK?

646
01:04:29,708 --> 01:04:31,958
I'm worried about you, son.

647
01:04:32,041 --> 01:04:36,541
Between your father and his politics
and you... it'll be the death of me.

648
01:04:39,876 --> 01:04:43,459
Let's go to the roof,
we'll be alone.

649
01:04:54,878 --> 01:04:58,420
What's wrong? Aren't you
happy to see me?

650
01:04:58,753 --> 01:05:03,378
Juan has been found dead near
the Trafalgar lighthouse.

651
01:05:08,129 --> 01:05:10,129
Can't say I'm sorry.

652
01:05:11,628 --> 01:05:13,503
He really hurt me.

653
01:05:14,963 --> 01:05:18,213
I can still remember his letter
word for word.

654
01:05:22,006 --> 01:05:24,547
What did you do last night?

655
01:05:24,630 --> 01:05:27,965
Why did you ask your mother
to lie?

656
01:05:28,007 --> 01:05:31,381
You know very well where I was
and what I did.

657
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:38,090
- I did it for us.
- Don't touch me, murderer!

658
01:05:38,716 --> 01:05:40,716
It was your fault.

659
01:05:41,257 --> 01:05:44,592
You lied when you said
the letter was a joke.

660
01:05:44,675 --> 01:05:48,758
And when you said Juan and you
weren't lovers.

661
01:05:48,883 --> 01:05:52,717
I told you not to lie,
but you wouldn't listen.

662
01:05:53,468 --> 01:05:56,510
Anyway, it doesn't matter now.

663
01:05:57,676 --> 01:06:00,718
This death will unite us for ever.

664
01:06:26,764 --> 01:06:28,472
What's happened?

665
01:06:28,513 --> 01:06:30,221
Did he do that?

666
01:06:30,805 --> 01:06:34,138
Let's go inside, I'm naked.

667
01:06:34,597 --> 01:06:35,929
How did it happen?

668
01:06:36,055 --> 01:06:40,097
He came asking after a girl.
I said she wasn't here.

669
01:06:40,181 --> 01:06:42,223
He got angry and bit me.

670
01:06:42,265 --> 01:06:43,765
Is he a friend?

671
01:06:43,848 --> 01:06:48,433
No way. This girl Laura
introduced us. I was seeing her.

672
01:06:48,474 --> 01:06:53,350
She wrote to say she was coming,
but she changed her mind.

673
01:06:53,390 --> 01:06:56,725
He thought she was here.
What's going on?

674
01:06:56,767 --> 01:06:59,225
- Nothing.
- Is Laura OK?

675
01:06:59,350 --> 01:07:02,516
- What have they done to you, son?
- Nothing.

676
01:07:02,641 --> 01:07:05,391
- What do you mean?
- It's just a bite.

677
01:07:05,475 --> 01:07:07,893
Who was it? That film director?

678
01:07:07,976 --> 01:07:11,434
Can I talk to you or your husband?

679
01:07:11,518 --> 01:07:14,852
My husband is at one of those
parliament sessions.

680
01:07:14,934 --> 01:07:18,436
Go and disinfect that wound.
Cannibal!

681
01:07:19,269 --> 01:07:24,145
- I hope you're on the case.
- Don't worry, we'll get him.

682
01:07:24,228 --> 01:07:26,354
He's a very bad driver.

683
01:07:26,437 --> 01:07:29,728
Please sit down and tell me
what happened.

684
01:07:29,895 --> 01:07:34,145
A young man's been murdered
near the lighthouse.

685
01:07:34,187 --> 01:07:35,438
He was a friend of Pablo Quintero,
who came to see your son.

686
01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:43,605
My son's not involved with that
pervert. What's the victim's name?

687
01:07:43,647 --> 01:07:47,898
Juan. He worked at a beach bar
near the lighthouse.

688
01:07:48,481 --> 01:07:52,272
Your son says Pablo Quintero
came here...

689
01:07:52,522 --> 01:07:57,857
...looking for a mutual friend, a girl
called Laura. Do you know her?

690
01:07:57,899 --> 01:08:02,939
I've heard the name. I fear my son
might be in love with her.

691
01:08:03,148 --> 01:08:04,982
Here's proof.

692
01:08:08,650 --> 01:08:13,359
I don't want anyone to hear of this,
especially not my husband.

693
01:08:14,858 --> 01:08:17,234
He's got enought to worry about.

694
01:08:17,443 --> 01:08:20,859
Being a politician's wife
is like being a widow.

695
01:08:21,026 --> 01:08:24,568
- You do understand, don't you?
- Of course, I do.

696
01:08:26,277 --> 01:08:29,526
Have you discovered something?

697
01:08:30,693 --> 01:08:34,235
- Where was your son last night?
- He stayed at home.

698
01:08:35,277 --> 01:08:40,528
- Don't tell me he's a suspect.
- No, we suspect the girl.

699
01:08:41,362 --> 01:08:42,570
Good heavens!

700
01:08:42,695 --> 01:08:47,237
- Let us know if she gets in touch.
- Certainly. You too.

701
01:10:25,082 --> 01:10:27,290
- Will he pull through?
- Yes.

702
01:10:27,332 --> 01:10:31,916
He's badly bruised and has broken
a leg. But the worst is his head.

703
01:10:31,999 --> 01:10:33,958
- The head?
- Yes, but he'll recover.

704
01:10:34,041 --> 01:10:36,583
- Can I see him?
- Not yet.

705
01:10:36,874 --> 01:10:41,959
I advise you to go to your brother's
place and check it out.

706
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,252
Why?

707
01:10:43,293 --> 01:10:45,835
The police will search his place.

708
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:50,377
- He was here during the murder.
- No matter, they'll hassle him.

709
01:10:51,877 --> 01:10:54,377
Thanks. I'll be back tomorrow.

710
01:10:54,418 --> 01:10:59,961
Remove anything suspicious -
photos, postcards, drugs, notes...

711
01:11:00,044 --> 01:11:03,253
- You know what I mean.
- Yeah, I do.

712
01:11:12,463 --> 01:11:17,463
Same typeface. The two letters and
the script were typed on this.

713
01:11:18,589 --> 01:11:21,797
Here he refers to Laura P.
as "Bitter Heel".

714
01:11:21,839 --> 01:11:25,880
Look what I've found.
A quarter of coke.

715
01:11:26,005 --> 01:11:28,630
Not enough for a conviction.

716
01:11:28,713 --> 01:11:32,090
But enough for two lines.
How about it?

717
01:11:33,923 --> 01:11:35,756
That's your loss.

718
01:11:36,382 --> 01:11:39,091
This bitch is a knockout.

719
01:11:39,799 --> 01:11:43,216
- Wouldn't you like to lay her?
- Me? No.

720
01:11:43,258 --> 01:11:44,800
And you?

721
01:11:45,967 --> 01:11:48,509
Right here on this table.

722
01:11:49,342 --> 01:11:53,092
At my age, if it weren't for
these little vices...

723
01:11:53,175 --> 01:11:57,801
...you wouldn't survive the job.
I hope you find out sooner than I did.

724
01:11:57,843 --> 01:12:02,218
At your age I'll be Chief Inspector,
not a detective like you.

725
01:12:04,009 --> 01:12:06,802
I don't know why you became a cop.

726
01:12:06,844 --> 01:12:11,761
With your look, you should be
a model. You'd make more.

727
01:12:21,595 --> 01:12:25,179
- Look who's here!
- What are you doing here?

728
01:12:25,470 --> 01:12:26,721
Searching.

729
01:12:26,762 --> 01:12:29,888
Not me, he was. I was reading.

730
01:12:31,055 --> 01:12:33,138
Put that script down.

731
01:12:33,596 --> 01:12:36,472
This isn't a public library.

732
01:12:38,931 --> 01:12:40,264
Seems interesting.

733
01:12:42,348 --> 01:12:43,973
He can read!

734
01:12:44,181 --> 01:12:46,265
Do you know Laura P.?

735
01:12:46,306 --> 01:12:49,057
- Who is she?
- "Expressive eyes...

736
01:12:49,099 --> 01:12:53,765
"... honey-coloured. Average height,
but attractive.

737
01:12:54,099 --> 01:12:56,224
"With a lovely smile.

738
01:12:56,724 --> 01:12:58,891
"Laura is around 40.

739
01:13:00,392 --> 01:13:03,058
"And dreams of having a face-lift.

740
01:13:03,100 --> 01:13:06,434
"She has a wooden leg and
lives in a lighthouse.

741
01:13:07,101 --> 01:13:10,227
"She retired there to
seek revenge.

742
01:13:10,269 --> 01:13:14,351
"But doesn't realise that she's
the victim of that revenge. "

743
01:13:16,061 --> 01:13:18,352
Are you going to read it all?

744
01:13:18,436 --> 01:13:21,561
It's your brother's description
of Laura P.

745
01:13:21,644 --> 01:13:24,185
- She doesn't exist.
- The lighthouse does.

746
01:13:24,686 --> 01:13:27,227
Then get your information
from it.

747
01:13:27,269 --> 01:13:29,395
We've got information.

748
01:13:32,645 --> 01:13:35,563
These two letters were typed
on this machine.

749
01:13:35,646 --> 01:13:37,937
One signed by your brother,
the other by her.

750
01:13:38,730 --> 01:13:43,355
This is absurd. Laura is a fictitious
character invented by my brother.

751
01:13:43,397 --> 01:13:45,106
Who wrote that letter, then?

752
01:13:45,356 --> 01:13:47,481
What colour are your eyes?

753
01:13:47,564 --> 01:13:49,981
"Expressive eyes, honey-coloured. "

754
01:13:50,023 --> 01:13:53,647
- You're of average height.
- "But attractive. "

755
01:13:53,689 --> 01:13:56,772
And I bet you have
a lovely smile.

756
01:13:56,814 --> 01:13:59,940
- Why don't you smile for us?
- Laura P.

757
01:14:00,024 --> 01:14:02,858
Get your fucking mother
to smile for you.

758
01:14:03,691 --> 01:14:06,441
- People like you should be dead.
- Hands off!

759
01:14:09,150 --> 01:14:13,275
People like you shouldn't hit
a defenceless woman.

760
01:14:13,483 --> 01:14:15,443
You're not a woman.

761
01:14:19,859 --> 01:14:23,359
Bet you'll charge me with
hitting a cop.

762
01:14:24,192 --> 01:14:27,611
Your mother wasn't worth
fighting for.

763
01:14:27,693 --> 01:14:29,485
Queers! You'll pay for this.

764
01:14:32,986 --> 01:14:35,861
They must be on holiday.

765
01:14:39,070 --> 01:14:40,279
Let's go.

766
01:14:55,195 --> 01:14:57,905
- At last!
- Where am I?

767
01:14:58,447 --> 01:15:00,530
You've had an accident.

768
01:15:01,030 --> 01:15:02,989
An accident?

769
01:15:04,573 --> 01:15:08,324
- I don't remember anything.
- Nothing at all?

770
01:15:21,408 --> 01:15:26,242
Touch anything in his home, and I'll
report you. I've called a lawyer...

771
01:15:26,284 --> 01:15:29,700
He's awake, doctor.
But he's lost his memory.

772
01:15:29,742 --> 01:15:32,160
- We'll come with you.
- No, you won't.

773
01:15:32,201 --> 01:15:38,077
- We'll help him recover his memory.
- We've got other methods.

774
01:15:38,119 --> 01:15:41,243
Careful. A cover-up is
also a crime.

775
01:15:41,327 --> 01:15:44,661
And torturing a patient
is an act of charity?

776
01:15:44,703 --> 01:15:49,870
We'll wait outside. You're not
a Chief Inspector yet.

777
01:15:52,161 --> 01:15:55,162
- Leave us alone.
- Yes. Excuse me.

778
01:15:56,995 --> 01:15:59,537
So you don't remember anything?

779
01:15:59,662 --> 01:16:04,371
Who am I?
Why are those men there?

780
01:16:04,413 --> 01:16:08,080
They're police. Your name's Pablo.
A friend of yours was murdered.

781
01:16:08,122 --> 01:16:11,164
<i>" Mysterious death in the lighthouse. "</i>

782
01:16:11,622 --> 01:16:12,873
Did I kill him?

783
01:16:13,081 --> 01:16:16,248
No. They suspect
a friend of yours, Laura.

784
01:16:16,998 --> 01:16:20,664
- Laura.
- Yes. So they want to question you.

785
01:16:20,831 --> 01:16:22,664
I've called a lawyer.

786
01:16:22,706 --> 01:16:24,457
Remember him?

787
01:16:26,832 --> 01:16:29,499
Rest. You need to recover.

788
01:16:29,708 --> 01:16:33,500
- What used I to do?
- Films.

789
01:16:33,541 --> 01:16:36,709
- How were they?
- Marvellous.

790
01:16:36,751 --> 01:16:39,751
Get better soon so
you can do more.

791
01:16:58,835 --> 01:17:01,961
Amnesia will buy us a month,
at most.

792
01:17:02,045 --> 01:17:04,295
And if he gets cataleptic?

793
01:17:04,337 --> 01:17:08,712
That's different. If he can't talk,
they can't question him.

794
01:17:08,879 --> 01:17:10,046
- Hello.
- Hello, Tina. - Hello.

795
01:17:10,797 --> 01:17:14,130
- Guzmán Morales, Pablo's lawyer.
- Nice to meet you.

796
01:17:14,379 --> 01:17:19,005
- We'll talk later.
- OK, thanks. How is he?

797
01:17:19,213 --> 01:17:20,838
- He's awake.
- Yeah?

798
01:17:21,004 --> 01:17:23,422
- But...
- But what?

799
01:17:23,464 --> 01:17:27,380
- He's lost his memory.
- I must see him.

800
01:17:27,506 --> 01:17:30,048
- She looks like a real woman.
- Of course.

801
01:17:38,591 --> 01:17:42,549
- Who are you?
- Your sister, Tina Quintero.

802
01:17:43,050 --> 01:17:46,300
My God, you don't remember
anything.

803
01:17:47,175 --> 01:17:49,258
I'll have to fill you in.

804
01:17:49,300 --> 01:17:54,134
- The doctor's told me a few things.
- Did he tell you about me?

805
01:17:55,509 --> 01:17:57,968
- Mum?
- Yes.

806
01:17:58,052 --> 01:18:02,094
- Will she come to see me?
- No, we're orphans.

807
01:18:02,218 --> 01:18:06,135
Our father's is alive,
but he's in New York.

808
01:18:06,302 --> 01:18:08,844
He hasn't written for years.

809
01:18:09,385 --> 01:18:11,136
Our parents separated...

810
01:18:12,136 --> 01:18:14,553
...when we were very young.

811
01:18:14,595 --> 01:18:19,512
You stayed with mum here
in Madrid. This is Madrid.

812
01:18:19,678 --> 01:18:23,137
I went with dad to Morocco.

813
01:18:23,179 --> 01:18:27,472
He's a painter, and he had
a studio there.

814
01:18:28,263 --> 01:18:31,763
There are things we've
never talked about.

815
01:18:33,264 --> 01:18:37,098
It was my fault our parents
separated.

816
01:18:39,182 --> 01:18:41,182
I was involved with dad.

817
01:18:42,099 --> 01:18:43,306
One day...

818
01:18:43,765 --> 01:18:46,681
...Mum caught us out.

819
01:18:48,932 --> 01:18:52,349
And... well, you can imagine.

820
01:18:52,432 --> 01:18:54,391
So you went to Morocco.

821
01:18:58,141 --> 01:19:02,100
We lived there a few years
and we were happy.

822
01:19:02,183 --> 01:19:05,267
Until he left me...
for another woman.

823
01:19:06,643 --> 01:19:08,268
I never forgave him.

824
01:19:08,435 --> 01:19:12,477
He hurt me so much, I haven't
been with another man since.

825
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:15,310
- Did I know about it?
- You really don't remember?

826
01:19:15,352 --> 01:19:18,352
Your amnesia leaves me
without a past.

827
01:19:18,394 --> 01:19:24,061
I'll go mad if you don't recover
your memory. Look, the two of us.

828
01:19:25,144 --> 01:19:29,104
That's you, and that one is me.

829
01:19:31,729 --> 01:19:33,396
What do you mean?

830
01:19:34,646 --> 01:19:37,521
At first I was a boy.

831
01:19:38,022 --> 01:19:43,563
But when I arrived in Morocco
with dad, I changed my sex.

832
01:19:44,438 --> 01:19:46,979
We had decided before leaving.

833
01:19:47,021 --> 01:19:50,564
- Did you decide, or did he?
- What does it matter?

834
01:19:50,606 --> 01:19:53,231
He liked the idea.

835
01:19:53,272 --> 01:19:55,773
And I was crazy about him.

836
01:19:57,107 --> 01:20:00,232
- Would you have done it anyway?
- Probably.

837
01:20:00,273 --> 01:20:05,400
- Don't judge me now, you never did.
- I won't. But I need to know.

838
01:20:05,857 --> 01:20:08,401
He's my father too, I suppose.

839
01:20:09,858 --> 01:20:15,733
I don't regret it. I'd have given
my life for him if he'd asked me.

840
01:20:16,984 --> 01:20:18,400
I understand.

841
01:20:20,026 --> 01:20:21,609
What happened then?

842
01:20:21,651 --> 01:20:26,527
After he left me, I got
a false passport...

843
01:20:26,568 --> 01:20:28,777
...and I went to Paris.

844
01:20:29,193 --> 01:20:32,611
I couldn't face you or mum.

845
01:20:34,444 --> 01:20:37,320
I only came back for
her funeral.

846
01:20:39,445 --> 01:20:44,404
That's when you and I
were reunited.

847
01:20:45,153 --> 01:20:48,280
We were both so lonely.

848
01:20:48,321 --> 01:20:53,321
And we still loved each other
after so many years.

849
01:20:53,363 --> 01:20:57,989
You didn't hold a grudge
against me, and that...

850
01:20:58,030 --> 01:21:01,698
I could never thank you enough.

851
01:21:03,990 --> 01:21:06,615
That's why I stayed with you.

852
01:21:11,323 --> 01:21:13,699
You're all I've got.

853
01:21:26,200 --> 01:21:29,618
Come here. Give me a hug.

854
01:21:29,993 --> 01:21:31,368
I can't.

855
01:21:38,827 --> 01:21:41,369
I'm glad you're my sister.

856
01:21:41,618 --> 01:21:46,119
So that nothing happens to Pablo
and he's protected from the police.

857
01:21:46,160 --> 01:21:48,703
The Sorrowful Mysteries.

858
01:21:48,786 --> 01:21:52,411
First Mystery: Jesus praying
in the Garden.

859
01:21:52,452 --> 01:21:56,787
Our Father, who art in Heaven,
hallowed be Thy name...

860
01:21:59,038 --> 01:22:03,454
Give us this day our daily bread
and forgive us our trespasses.

861
01:22:09,122 --> 01:22:12,455
After three weeks
he's still the same.

862
01:22:12,955 --> 01:22:15,247
Leave this case to me, father.

863
01:22:15,330 --> 01:22:19,498
Want to pension me off?
I've still got two months to go.

864
01:22:20,582 --> 01:22:22,623
Look who's here.

865
01:22:25,748 --> 01:22:28,958
I don't want you to go
on a downer.

866
01:22:29,166 --> 01:22:32,749
Leave the dirty work to me.
You're too scrupulous.

867
01:22:32,833 --> 01:22:35,750
And you're too clumsy.
You'll go far.

868
01:22:35,834 --> 01:22:40,126
I feel great today. Here,
split it between yourselves.

869
01:22:40,168 --> 01:22:44,667
- And the cocaine?
- Naughty boy. Tomorrow.

870
01:22:44,709 --> 01:22:48,960
- And the bag?
- That's for my brother. Bye now.

871
01:22:49,002 --> 01:22:52,878
You make me so happy.
Watch those two.

872
01:22:53,085 --> 01:22:55,627
There's nothing like charity.

873
01:22:58,211 --> 01:23:00,712
What's the typewriter for?

874
01:23:00,753 --> 01:23:03,254
Leave her alone.
She knows nothing.

875
01:23:04,588 --> 01:23:07,087
Go for the brother.
He knows everything.

876
01:23:07,129 --> 01:23:11,337
I'll make him talk today.
I'll show you who's clumsy.

877
01:23:11,379 --> 01:23:13,503
Don't take me seriously, son.

878
01:23:14,837 --> 01:23:19,504
To be a good cop, being
unscrupulous is not enough.

879
01:23:19,963 --> 01:23:22,672
You need a sense of humour, too.

880
01:23:22,881 --> 01:23:27,882
I thought I wasn't going to make it.
I've brought you all sorts of stuff.

881
01:23:30,214 --> 01:23:32,966
- Here.
- What are we celebrating?

882
01:23:33,090 --> 01:23:36,799
Something marvellous.
I've got a boyfriend.

883
01:23:36,841 --> 01:23:41,215
I met him when I was picking up
your mail. We screwed in your bed.

884
01:23:41,299 --> 01:23:45,049
I didn't dare take him home.
I hope you don't mind.

885
01:23:45,175 --> 01:23:46,216
No, no, of course not.

886
01:23:46,341 --> 01:23:50,468
- I wanted to be sure before I told you.
Are you happy? - Yes, very much.

887
01:23:50,551 --> 01:23:52,468
- You don't look it.
- Tina...

888
01:23:53,675 --> 01:23:57,343
- I've something to tell you too.
- What is it?

889
01:23:57,427 --> 01:24:01,302
- I've recovered my memory.
- Really?

890
01:24:01,343 --> 01:24:05,219
- Just wait till I tell Ada.
- Don't. I don't want anyone to know.

891
01:24:05,261 --> 01:24:09,136
- Why not?
- I'm happy here.

892
01:24:09,178 --> 01:24:12,969
The police won't leave us alone
until you talk.

893
01:24:13,011 --> 01:24:16,595
- They think I'm Laura P.
- That woman doesn't exist.

894
01:24:16,636 --> 01:24:20,637
- And the letters?
- Tina, keep out of this.

895
01:24:21,888 --> 01:24:23,137
All right.

896
01:24:23,846 --> 01:24:26,555
Up to you. I've brought
your typewriter.

897
01:24:26,764 --> 01:24:30,305
- In case you feel like writing.
- No, take it away.

898
01:24:30,555 --> 01:24:31,930
Pablo, what's going on?

899
01:24:33,598 --> 01:24:38,556
Don't look like that. Main thing is
you're in love, and happy.

900
01:24:41,638 --> 01:24:47,765
I won't be happy until you're back
at work. But if you don't talk...

901
01:24:47,848 --> 01:24:52,308
I'll talk in a few days.
I'm not strong enough yet.

902
01:24:52,390 --> 01:24:55,516
I have enough strength
for the two of us.

903
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:57,267
That's how I like it.

904
01:24:59,100 --> 01:25:03,809
- Want me here for the questioning?
- No, I'll get the doctor to call you.

905
01:25:05,018 --> 01:25:07,768
Tina, I'm so happy for you.

906
01:25:07,851 --> 01:25:11,684
This time will be different.
I can feel it.

907
01:25:20,728 --> 01:25:25,936
- Isn't that a bit heavy for you?
- Don't worry, I'm very strong.

908
01:25:25,978 --> 01:25:30,313
So I see. Don't lose it, OK?
We might want to confiscate it.

909
01:25:30,355 --> 01:25:34,896
- Aren't you hot in that jacket?
- Yes, but I feel good in it.

910
01:25:34,937 --> 01:25:36,604
How's your brother?

911
01:25:36,645 --> 01:25:40,687
The same, or worse.
Don't question him yet.

912
01:25:40,729 --> 01:25:45,022
A man has been murdered and it's
our job to find the murderer.

913
01:25:45,064 --> 01:25:48,522
How many murderers
have you caught?

914
01:25:48,564 --> 01:25:51,731
Don't be unfair. The boy's
just starting.

915
01:25:51,773 --> 01:25:54,648
Why don't you leave us alone?

916
01:26:03,483 --> 01:26:08,982
- The lawyer isn't here.
- We just want to talk about Laura.

917
01:26:09,483 --> 01:26:12,900
No one with that name
has come to see me.

918
01:26:14,609 --> 01:26:18,151
Think she's out there?
On the roof maybe?

919
01:26:18,734 --> 01:26:20,859
Could be a pseudonym.

920
01:26:20,901 --> 01:26:23,860
You seem to know her
better than I do.

921
01:26:23,943 --> 01:26:27,235
Does Antonio Benítez ring a bell?

922
01:26:27,319 --> 01:26:31,111
- They both know you.
- I seem to be famous.

923
01:26:31,195 --> 01:26:33,736
And that means you don't
have to talk?

924
01:26:34,028 --> 01:26:39,444
If a murder's been committed,
you should find the murderer.

925
01:26:39,527 --> 01:26:42,695
Not a poor amnesiac.

926
01:26:42,779 --> 01:26:44,445
The letters.

927
01:26:44,528 --> 01:26:49,029
Both written on your typewriter.
How do you explain that?

928
01:26:49,112 --> 01:26:50,154
You tell me.

929
01:26:50,237 --> 01:26:53,072
These letters are not
the only proof.

930
01:26:53,280 --> 01:26:56,364
- You're late.
- I went to the boutique.

931
01:26:56,489 --> 01:26:57,489
It's closed.

932
01:26:57,614 --> 01:27:02,448
It opened today. A shirt like Pablo's
was sold to Antonio Benítez.

933
01:27:02,490 --> 01:27:05,073
- He and his mother deny it.
- And you believe them.

934
01:27:06,490 --> 01:27:09,864
We've got the boy
under surveillance.

935
01:27:09,948 --> 01:27:12,074
He's going out with his sister.

936
01:27:14,573 --> 01:27:15,615
What?

937
01:27:15,698 --> 01:27:19,908
He's been comforting your sister.
Didn't she tell you?

938
01:27:20,824 --> 01:27:23,034
I should have guessed.

939
01:27:23,200 --> 01:27:29,159
- Why didn't I? - What is it, Pablo?
- I need a phone. She's off today.

940
01:27:29,243 --> 01:27:30,952
Let's go to my office.

941
01:27:32,618 --> 01:27:34,618
Go on without me.

942
01:27:35,701 --> 01:27:40,077
The Glorious Mysteries.
First Mystery: The Resurrection.

943
01:27:40,244 --> 01:27:41,285
- Yes?
- Tina.

944
01:27:41,410 --> 01:27:46,078
<i>Say yes or no and don't mention
my name. Are you alone? - No.</i>

945
01:27:46,286 --> 01:27:49,619
<i>- What's wrong?
- Is Antonio Benítez with you?</i>

946
01:27:50,328 --> 01:27:53,620
<i>- How do you know his name?
- Listen to me.</i>

947
01:27:53,703 --> 01:27:54,912
He murdered Juan.

948
01:27:54,954 --> 01:27:57,704
<i>He's not a bad guy,
but he's crazy.</i>

949
01:27:57,829 --> 01:27:59,496
It can't be.

950
01:27:59,579 --> 01:28:05,205
<i>There's a cop outside. Don't look.
Don't let Antonio see him. Tina...</i>

951
01:28:05,412 --> 01:28:06,955
<i>Just keep calm.</i>

952
01:28:07,163 --> 01:28:10,164
<i>We'll be there in
a few minutes.</i>

953
01:28:11,205 --> 01:28:13,121
It was too good to be true.

954
01:28:13,205 --> 01:28:16,289
- Forget that now.
- And think about what?

955
01:28:16,373 --> 01:28:20,081
<i>You're in danger,
don't you understand?</i>

956
01:28:20,164 --> 01:28:25,123
<i>Act normal. Bet he's looking at you.
Find an excuse to leave the house.</i>

957
01:28:25,332 --> 01:28:29,750
<i>Say you've got to testify.
And bring the girl with you.</i>

958
01:28:30,667 --> 01:28:32,791
<i>- All right?
- All right.</i>

959
01:28:34,291 --> 01:28:37,999
- The hospital? What did they say?
- Pablo is dead.

960
01:28:40,542 --> 01:28:44,960
He jumped out of the window while
he was being questioned.

961
01:28:45,001 --> 01:28:48,335
You must bring him back to life.

962
01:28:48,459 --> 01:28:50,502
He's mine! Pablo is mine.

963
01:28:52,044 --> 01:28:54,669
- He wanted to save me.
- What do you mean?

964
01:29:02,211 --> 01:29:03,211
Nothing.

965
01:29:03,419 --> 01:29:07,587
We must go to the hospital.
You wait here.

966
01:29:07,796 --> 01:29:08,879
Wait, wait.

967
01:29:09,087 --> 01:29:11,629
- I'm going with you.
- No need.

968
01:29:11,754 --> 01:29:15,380
How can you be so calm knowing
your brother is dead?

969
01:29:15,463 --> 01:29:18,838
And why are you so concerned?
You don't even know him.

970
01:29:18,921 --> 01:29:21,880
Why is that policeman
out there?

971
01:29:24,422 --> 01:29:26,048
Let us go.

972
01:29:26,131 --> 01:29:31,215
Who phoned you? How could your
brother jump with a leg in plaster?

973
01:29:31,464 --> 01:29:35,340
Maybe the police pushed him.
Let us go.

974
01:29:39,049 --> 01:29:40,590
Run, Ada, run.

975
01:29:41,966 --> 01:29:45,299
You go, Ada! Don't touch me,
you scum!

976
01:29:54,885 --> 01:29:58,802
- Go up. He wants to kill Tina.
- Who?

977
01:29:58,926 --> 01:30:00,635
- A man.
- Calm down.

978
01:30:00,718 --> 01:30:03,552
Up there. Please help her.

979
01:30:36,180 --> 01:30:39,764
- Where's Tina?
- She fought with Antonio.

980
01:30:39,889 --> 01:30:43,098
- Did you see policeman? - I don't know.
- He was down here. - Yes.

981
01:30:43,223 --> 01:30:45,306
- Where's he?
- He went up.

982
01:30:45,432 --> 01:30:48,641
- And he hasn't come down? - No.
- Antonio might be armed.

983
01:30:55,183 --> 01:30:58,766
- Don't move.
- Let go of me.

984
01:30:59,599 --> 01:31:02,225
- Give yourself up.
- He's got a gun.

985
01:31:02,434 --> 01:31:07,684
- Turn the spotlight off!
- Antonio, come out with Tina.

986
01:31:10,184 --> 01:31:12,935
- Turn the spotlight off!
- Turn it off.

987
01:31:18,728 --> 01:31:20,894
Anyone moves, and I'll shoot her.

988
01:31:21,144 --> 01:31:24,979
- Antonio, is our colleague there?
- Yes, he's up here.

989
01:31:25,854 --> 01:31:30,645
Stay calm. Let them go and
nothing will happen to you.

990
01:31:30,894 --> 01:31:34,979
Think I'm stupid?
I want to negotiate first.

991
01:31:35,229 --> 01:31:37,062
There's nothing to negotiate.

992
01:31:38,479 --> 01:31:41,230
Put that gun down!
What do you want?

993
01:31:43,439 --> 01:31:46,523
I want Pablo to come up.
I'll only talk to him.

994
01:31:48,481 --> 01:31:53,065
- Antonio, will you let Tina go if I do?
- And the policeman?

995
01:31:53,149 --> 01:31:55,606
I will if you come up.

996
01:31:55,773 --> 01:31:58,898
I'll throw you the keys.
Where are they?

997
01:32:36,069 --> 01:32:39,321
- What do you want?
- I wanted to see you.

998
01:32:39,820 --> 01:32:42,237
Here I am. Untie her.

999
01:32:45,821 --> 01:32:48,030
I can't. Do you mind?

1000
01:32:48,988 --> 01:32:52,114
- Is he dead?
- No, I just hit him.

1001
01:32:52,196 --> 01:32:55,113
- Try to bring him round.
- I will.

1002
01:32:55,196 --> 01:32:58,405
- You didn't need to come up.
- Shut up.

1003
01:33:12,115 --> 01:33:14,741
- Take him away, Tina.
- No.

1004
01:33:14,824 --> 01:33:19,325
Go! I created this situation
and I have to deal with it.

1005
01:33:19,699 --> 01:33:23,908
You've been fooling me, you two.
I hate you.

1006
01:33:24,159 --> 01:33:26,117
Go now. Go!

1007
01:33:26,409 --> 01:33:28,450
I'll be back in a second.

1008
01:33:35,201 --> 01:33:37,618
Bloody typewriter!

1009
01:33:49,328 --> 01:33:51,370
Pablo, get away from there.

1010
01:33:54,662 --> 01:33:56,203
Wait a minute.

1011
01:33:58,037 --> 01:34:01,746
No one shoot.
I'm coming out to talk.

1012
01:34:01,996 --> 01:34:05,079
- Give me the gun.
- Learn to use it first.

1013
01:34:05,204 --> 01:34:07,247
But you never let me use it.

1014
01:34:07,372 --> 01:34:10,122
What a waste of taxpayers' money!

1015
01:34:12,956 --> 01:34:14,789
No one come near the door.

1016
01:34:15,123 --> 01:34:18,706
Wait there, in the middle
of the road.

1017
01:34:19,415 --> 01:34:21,999
Come on, move away.

1018
01:34:23,582 --> 01:34:26,082
- And Pablo?
- He's fine.

1019
01:34:26,665 --> 01:34:29,207
Listen to me. I want an hour...

1020
01:34:29,415 --> 01:34:31,708
...to negotiate with Pablo.

1021
01:34:31,791 --> 01:34:34,082
Any interruptions...

1022
01:34:34,291 --> 01:34:37,834
...and I kill everyone.
I'm crazy enough.

1023
01:34:38,417 --> 01:34:40,584
OK, you've got an hour.

1024
01:34:47,918 --> 01:34:49,336
One hour.

1025
01:35:08,587 --> 01:35:11,629
I needed to see you at any price.

1026
01:35:16,171 --> 01:35:20,756
<i>I doubt you'll ever love me...</i>

1027
01:35:23,130 --> 01:35:26,047
<i>...the way I love you.</i>

1028
01:35:32,797 --> 01:35:37,549
<i>I doubt you'll ever find
as pure a love...</i>

1029
01:35:39,591 --> 01:35:42,716
<i>...as the one you'll find in me.</i>

1030
01:35:45,258 --> 01:35:50,967
<i>You'll have a thousand adventures
without love.</i>

1031
01:35:52,801 --> 01:35:56,258
<i>But at the end of it all...</i>

1032
01:35:57,134 --> 01:36:00,301
<i>...you'll find only pain.</i>

1033
01:36:02,134 --> 01:36:06,594
<i>You'll be ecstatic with pleasure.</i>

1034
01:36:09,719 --> 01:36:13,345
<i>But you will never find
as pure an illusion...</i>

1035
01:36:13,678 --> 01:36:16,721
<i>...as the one I made you feel.</i>

1036
01:36:55,265 --> 01:36:57,432
Loving you this way is a crime.

1037
01:36:58,266 --> 01:37:00,850
But I'm willing to pay the price.

1038
01:37:02,809 --> 01:37:05,892
I knew it when I picked you up
at the disco.

1039
01:37:07,017 --> 01:37:10,060
I knew it'd be a very high price.

1040
01:37:14,394 --> 01:37:16,520
But I have no regrets.

1041
01:37:18,894 --> 01:37:21,769
I don't care what happens
in a hour.

1042
01:37:22,269 --> 01:37:25,560
And you shouldn't think
about it either.

1043
01:37:45,980 --> 01:37:47,773
How am I doing?

1044
01:37:49,815 --> 01:37:51,814
You taught me how.

1045
01:38:11,317 --> 01:38:12,733
Thank you very much.

1046
01:38:17,442 --> 01:38:19,609
Cover up, it's cold.

1047
01:38:19,693 --> 01:38:22,442
I'll get your crutch
and help you dress.

1048
01:38:25,735 --> 01:38:26,777
Antonio.

1049
01:38:29,026 --> 01:38:30,902
- Antonio!
- Stay there.

1050
01:39:11,240 --> 01:39:15,324
<i>Who will wipe from your life
the memory of me...</i>

1051
01:39:16,074 --> 01:39:19,783
<i>...and make you forget
my love?</i>

1052
01:39:20,491 --> 01:39:25,075
<i>Poor love, made of
blood and pain.</i>

1053
01:39:25,825 --> 01:39:29,033
<i>This love, that saw
both of us crying...</i>

1054
01:39:29,075 --> 01:39:32,909
<i>...also made us dream and live.</i>

1055
01:39:33,118 --> 01:39:35,368
<i>How did it cease to exist?</i>
