2
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:41,270
I couldn't hear anything with the music.
What is it?

3
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:44,630
I'm a policeman.
Didn't you see my ID?

4
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,710
I'm short-sighted.

5
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:50,910
I'm not.

6
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:55,270
Live opposite one of those windows..

7
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:59,270
I couldn't help noticing your plants.

8
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:04,710
- Pretty, Aren't they?
- Don't try to be clever with me.

9
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:10,990
It 's drugs.
You must think I'm soft in the head.

10
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:15,950
Talking of head,
how do you like my little pussy?

11
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:21,710
From here it looks...

12
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:24,430
scrumptious.

13
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:27,710
Saul sold his first-born
for a plate of lentils

14
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:31,190
Wouldn't you turn a blind eye
for a taste of this?

15
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:34,190
Let's see.

16
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:40,030
It doesn't come free.

17
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:43,110
OK.

18
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:48,670
I'll keep my mouth shut,
and you move the plants.

19
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:50,350
All right.

20
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:57,390
Don't go all tight on me.

21
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:00,390
Can we do it from behind?
I'm used to it that way.

22
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:02,070
Pervert!

23
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:05,310
I'm a virgin.
I'm not ready to lose my virtue.

24
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:10,750
Shut your mouth, doll.
I do things face to face.

25
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:19,510
Fuck! I never would have believed
you were a virgin!.

26
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:25,790
PEPI WAS HUNGRY FOR REVENGE

27
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:10,270
- The chorus should be higher.
- What's wrong with it?

28
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:13,190
- Like egg whites.
- Hi.

29
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:16,750
- How's it going, Pepi?
- I'm fine.

30
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:20,790
I've got a proposition for you.

31
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:23,670
An American tour. I can see it now..

32
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,070
Shut up.

33
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:27,990
I've got a problem you can help me with.

34
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:31,390
And what are you offering in return?

35
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:34,590
- All of my hash plants.
- It's a deal.

36
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:37,630
- OK, guys?
- Of course.

37
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:43,790
Give him a good kicking,
but don't go too far.

38
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:46,950
We don't want anyone to die,
now is not the time.

39
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:49,830
No problem, girl.

40
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:53,710
The only elastic is in my garter.

41
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,990
He's here. Go on.

42
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:12,750
Sing, so he doesn't suspect anything.

43
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:25,990
Not in the balls!

44
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:31,310
What's going on?

45
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:39,030
Why me? What have I done?

46
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:42,470
Great. You'll be in a sorry state.

47
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:51,230
You bastards!

48
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:54,790
Why are you beating me up?

49
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:24,510
Stand in line. I'll pass them down.

50
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:26,550
Here we go.

51
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:34,230
Careful you don't get the lift dirty.

52
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:36,830
It's so sad to see them go.

53
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:39,350
That was some going-over you gave him.

54
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:41,070
This one's crap.

55
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:46,510
You liked giving a policeman
a good kicking, didn't you?

56
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:49,790
- It's your kind of thing.
- Let's go.

57
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:52,510
- Shall we leave you that one?
- Why not?

58
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:58,670
Are you Matilde...? No, Kleenex. Hi.

59
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:02,430
- Hi Pilar. Just a minute.
- Yes, OK.

60
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:06,470
Wait. It's Kleenex
who signed the letter.

61
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:09,070
ETA STABILISES SOUTHERN FRONT

62
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:12,950
It's bad enough having
a brother who's a policeman.

63
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:16,390
but when he's your twin,
it's the bitter end.

64
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:18,830
I'm always the one who gets beaten up.

65
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:22,550
With so much democracy in this country,
where will it end?

66
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:26,630
Those Communists need to be
taught a lesson. Leave it to me.

67
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:30,150
Listen... I'm...

68
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:32,950
I'm the victim here
and I don't want publicity.

69
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:34,550
Thanks, but don't bother.

70
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:39,870
If it happened to me, I'd take my gun
and shower them with bullets.

71
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:42,670
Do you know what you should do,

72
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:46,190
to make sure
this never happens to me again?

73
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:47,430
Move out of here.

74
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:51,430
I don't know why you bought
that house in Parque de Lisboa.

75
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:54,630
We'll move when we're good and ready.

76
00:11:54,750 --> 00:12:00,190
We've all the same right to be here,
me, you and Luci. Get it?

77
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:04,030
Thanks. I didn't expect
anything better from you.

78
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:07,670
Have you forgotten
who's been paying for your bills?

79
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:12,510
You know what? I'm leaving.

80
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:15,710
- Right now.
- Juan, don't be upset.

81
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:19,990
Sorry Luci.
It's nothing to do with you.

82
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:22,710
You've got enough problems,
married to him.

83
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:25,110
You haven't drunk your coffee.

84
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:31,190
Do you think I can?

85
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:36,950
I'll get a transfer to the Canaries.
No one knows you there. I'll be safe.

86
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:39,670
He's right. We should leave him alone.

87
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:42,630
I don't know why we bought that flat.

88
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:45,310
Shut up. this is man's business.

89
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:12,750
- I'm taking a taxi.
- Wait, we'll take a taxi.

90
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:15,430
Do you think I came here to do that?

91
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:17,830
I'm a singer and a model, not a whore.

92
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:19,670
A holiday in Morocco...

93
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:22,110
- A Moroccan brothel?
- Of course not.

94
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:25,350
I'll report you
for white slave trafficking.

95
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:27,790
I didn't leave my village for that.

96
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:30,950
I've got talent.
As a singer and model, not as a whore.

97
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:32,270
I know...

98
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:36,390
The business you're talking about,
I can just stand on the corner.

99
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:40,870
- You have to eat.
- I don't need a pimp to take my money.

100
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:44,670
Take your money?
I'm just trying to get you a job.

101
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:48,670
You guys are all the same. Taxi!

102
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:50,990
- Wait a minute.
- Taxi!

103
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:54,830
You'll see. Just let me explain...

104
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:57,950
- I'm going right now.
- Wait until five o'clock.

105
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:04,870
There isn't a mark on him.
We'll see about that.

106
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:16,950
- How's things?
- Fine.

107
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:19,590
Going to the market?
I've just been.

108
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:23,030
The price of potatoes has gone up again.

109
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:24,550
Be quiet.

110
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:27,030
That's bad news on a bad day.

111
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:29,390
You look terrible. What's happened?

112
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:33,910
- It's a terrible thing.
- Tell me what happened.

113
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:38,470
My husband and my brother-in-law
had a terrible fight.

114
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:42,910
- And?
- So Juan left the house.

115
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:46,830
What a shame!
Did he leave me a message?

116
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:49,030
- Quiet!
- No...

117
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:53,270
I can't let her get away.
I have to say something.

118
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,790
But how can I start speaking to her?

119
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:57,950
Yes... The jersey.

120
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:00,190
Of course he'll phone.

121
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:02,550
Can you ask him to call me?

122
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:05,510
When he calls, I'll say
you were asking after him.

123
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:10,190
- Ask him to leave a number.
- Yes, of course.

124
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:14,430
Luci, do you think
your brother-in-law likes me?

125
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:17,310
I don't know. Men are so weird.

126
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:21,350
What a lovely jersey you're wearing!

127
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:24,270
I made it myself.

128
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:28,150
That's amazing.
You could teach me to knit.

129
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:32,070
- I never thought of that.
- Well, think about it.

130
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:35,190
I live round here.
I'd pay you plenty.

131
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:38,710
- I don't know.
- You could make a living from it.

132
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:44,550
NEXT MORNING, PEPI
HAS HER FIRST LESSON

133
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:46,230
Look, help me.

134
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:49,270
I put the needle in,
put the wool round,

135
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:51,110
and there's the stitch.

136
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:53,030
No, not like that.

137
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:55,070
What do you mean?

138
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:58,630
You were doing it to the right
and you're going backwards.

139
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:01,990
What does it matter
if it's only practice?

140
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:05,430
If you know how to do it,
why are you doing it backwards?

141
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:08,230
You're ruining my knitting.

142
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:11,230
- No, you're doing it all wrong.
- Some teacher!

143
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:14,510
I'm not a teacher,
you're not paying attention.

144
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:18,470
Every time I make a mistake, I'll hit you.
That way, I'll learn.

145
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:21,470
You're right. I need a good slap.

146
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:24,270
Well!

147
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:27,030
That's your kind of thing.

148
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:28,510
How did you guess?

149
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:32,110
Your eyes are shining, you dirty bitch.

150
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:36,790
Some things you have to accept.
That's why I married him.

151
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:39,510
I thought that as a cop,
he'd treat me like a dog.

152
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:42,710
Some hope.
He respects me like his mother.

153
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:45,230
- You shouldn't trust him.
- I'm furious.

154
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:47,230
Don't worry.

155
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:49,550
As long as we do our knitting classes,

156
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:54,030
you'll get your slaps just the way
you like it, you crazy, dirty bitch.

157
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:59,790
- I'm all wet just thinking about it.
- Lucky you, you bitch.

158
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:01,910
So what do you do?

159
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:05,350
I'm an heiress, but my parents
are sick of giving me money.

160
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:07,750
They've told me to fend for myself.

161
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:09,390
What will you do now?

162
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:14,030
I thought about selling my virginity,
but I was raped so that's no good.

163
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:16,870
Well, at least you had some fun.

164
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:21,670
I'd have had much more fun
with the 60,000 ptas I'd have sold it for.

165
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:24,710
One woman's meat is another's poison.

166
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:29,590
I just want revenge on the guy who raped me.

167
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:33,590
Why should I lie to you?
It was your husband.

168
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:35,270
My husband?

169
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:38,750
Bastard! I should be so lucky.

170
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:42,470
- Who's this?
- My knitting teacher.

171
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:56,310
Forty-something and nice and tender.
Just the way I like them.

172
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:58,950
- I'm dying for a piss.
- Wait.

173
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:01,270
Piss on her.

174
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:03,630
She's hot. It'll cool her down.

175
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:10,430
It won't be easy.

176
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:12,270
but it'll be worth it.

177
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:14,710
Definitely. I'll help you.

178
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:17,070
Just relax.

179
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:19,790
Stand on the chair.

180
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:22,110
Lift your leg.

181
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:31,910
You like it, don't you?

182
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,990
I'm not a cow, you know.

183
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:44,990
Well...

184
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:47,550
Finished. No more.

185
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:50,950
That's it.

186
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:54,910
- Where are you from?
- Murcia.

187
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:59,990
We're going to be good friends.

188
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:03,950
You're invited to Toni's party,
at his cousin's house.

189
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:07,310
- It's gonna be fucking brilliant.
- Where'd he get the money?

190
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:10,070
Turning tricks with a queen, apparently.

191
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:11,790
I'll be there.

192
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:14,950
- Will you come?
- I don't know.

193
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:18,270
I've got to go.

194
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:24,790
- It was lovely to meet you.
- Make sure you come.

195
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:28,390
I'll expect you at the same time.

196
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:48,590
- Where have you been?
- Teaching knitting.

197
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:50,430
- Knitting?
- Yes.

198
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:54,190
- Why didn't you tell me last night?
- You were working.

199
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:56,590
Why is your shirt wet?

200
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:59,550
It was a glass of water, it got split.

201
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:04,270
- Have you been in a bar?
- No, my pupil did it by mistake.

202
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:06,230
Does she pay well?

203
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:09,910
- Yes.
- Is she a neighbour?

204
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:12,430
- You don't know her.
- All right.

205
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:16,470
Anyway, you know
I don't like independent women.

206
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:20,030
I believe that women have to find fulfilment.

207
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:22,830
And I get bored here at home.

208
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:26,150
Look, here's something
that will fulfil you.

209
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:29,070
So there is.

210
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:32,950
Amuse yourself by getting the food ready.
It's late and I'm hungry.

211
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:38,030
Why do you wear those trousers?
You know I hate them.

212
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:15,910
If your cousin comes home
in the middle of the party...

213
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:20,550
Stop nagging. I've told you,
they're away on their summer holidays.

214
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:24,750
Won't those people
complain about the music?

215
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:28,750
I've told you. They're away on holiday.

216
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:32,190
You're driving me nuts.
Stop being so paranoid.

217
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:33,990
All right.

218
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:42,510
I won't be quiet.
Why shouldn't I speak my mind?

219
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:45,750
Because I love you? You love me too
and you say what you want.

220
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:50,790
Do you think your silence makes you
loveable? It's driving me to despair.

221
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:53,910
When you don't talk, it drives me mad.

222
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:57,830
I think terrible thoughts about you.
your drinking, for example.

223
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:04,541
You're nice, sensitive, and intelligent.
People like that drink a lot.

224
00:22:04,551 --> 00:22:08,510
But you started drinking on the day
that Oscar, your best friend,

225
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:12,630
decided to stop pretending and get
a boyfriend, which is what he wanted.

226
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:17,350
You think you're so liberal, how can you
be so old-fashioned as to hate queers?

227
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:21,110
People are free to do what they want
with their bodies. But not you.

228
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:24,350
He was your best friend
and you couldn't forgive him.

229
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:26,790
It's as if you were jealous.

230
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:30,550
so you married me to get your own back
and you started drinking.

231
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:31,910
Some revenge!

232
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:42,590
Hey, Toni. How's it going?

233
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:44,590
What's up, Moncho?

234
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:47,470
Have you won the lottery, or what?

235
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:51,350
'Course not. Got myself a client.

236
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:56,590
I'm looking for something like that too
because living with my parents is...

237
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:09,430
Listen, I know someone.

238
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:13,190
But he's a real old queen
and you might not like him.

239
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:17,350
Yeah, man, you know I love old queens.

240
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:20,710
He might not like you, anyway.

241
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:25,790
They usually like exotic types like me,
and you, to be honest...

242
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:28,070
You can try, anyway.

243
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:30,750
How much did you get?

244
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:32,670
20 grand.

245
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:35,430
Just for...

246
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:37,310
...for sleeping with him?

247
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:40,230
I'll tell you.

248
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:42,950
But keep your mouth shout.

249
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:46,540
He's a really weird guy.

250
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:50,750
He's my cousin's neighbour
and I often come to see him.

251
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:54,870
The other day I was in the street
and he cam up to me with some dough.

252
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:59,230
He said, why don't you organise a party?
And that was it.

253
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:01,230
Is he coming?

254
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:05,030
I don't think so. He's weird.

255
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,590
That's his window up there.

256
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:10,670
I bet you he's looking out.

257
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:13,950
I know you want me and you need me,
whatever you say.

258
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:16,350
But knowing isn't enough.

259
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:19,510
It's been 40 days and 40 nights
since we last had a fuck.

260
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:23,470
and I'm about to explode.
I'm like a cat on a hot tin roof.

261
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:24,910
I deserve better.

262
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:29,350
I've no reason to despise myself
just because I've got facial hair.

263
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:33,550
You taught me that having a beard
isn't so bad, and I'm grateful.

264
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:35,670
If that's not proof that you love me...

265
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:37,750
The problem lies in the way we live.

266
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:40,070
If I wasn't so rich and we had to work,

267
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:42,470
I'm sure our problems would unite us.

268
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:45,110
But I'm not going to leave you, believe me.

269
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:47,550
I'll be with you always, no matter what.

270
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:49,910
I can put up with anything.

271
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:01,910
- Here.
- No, thanks.

272
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:05,670
I said, eat it.

273
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:18,030
You little tart.

274
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:21,190
You know how to make me horny.

275
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:24,670
Give it to me, it's mine.

276
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:31,230
- 100 ptas and it's yours.
- Go to hell.

277
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:33,430
Let's see.

278
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:35,310
I'd like to keep it as a souvenir.

279
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:37,870
That pain in the arse
is taking photos again.

280
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:39,630
Give it here.

281
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:43,990
Interesting.

282
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:46,110
- How much?
- 100 ptas.

283
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:48,150
I'll take it.

284
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:52,510
Now I can blackmail your husband.

285
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:55,230
- Good idea.
- You don't mind, do you?

286
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:58,510
'Course not. He deserves it.

287
00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:02,221
By the way, Pepi.
What were you saying the other day,

288
00:26:02,231 --> 00:26:04,950
I know a woman
who can do your mending.

289
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:07,710
- Do what?
- Your mending.

290
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:09,590
Where?

291
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:12,550
Down there.

292
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:17,270
I'll let you know.
I'd rather carry on using it for now.

293
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:21,270
You can't say I poke my nose
into your affairs.

294
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:25,270
Did I say anything yesterday,
when you said you'd lost 20,000 ptas?

295
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:28,670
I thought you'd probably
spent them on a prostitute.

296
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:31,670
I did think it,
but I didn't say anything.

297
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:36,470
I know I'm very possessive,
and very jealous.

298
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:38,510
I should give you more freedom.

299
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:41,510
But what can I do? I am the way I am.

300
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:44,950
And deep down I'm sure
that you like me the way I am.

301
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:49,350
And now, our competition:
"General erections".

302
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:52,070
Tonight's big surprise.

303
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:57,070
In "Erections", the guy
with the biggest dick,

304
00:26:57,190 --> 00:27:00,030
the most slender, enormous, perfect dick,

305
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:02,390
will be named King for the night,

306
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:04,950
and can do whatever he wants,

307
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:06,630
however he wants,

308
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:08,710
and with whoever he wants.

309
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:11,230
Does everyone agree?

310
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:16,510
The result will be announced
by our hostess, Pepi.

311
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:20,190
A round of applause for Pepi!

312
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:22,950
The result will also be decided

313
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:25,990
by multiplying the length by the thickness.

314
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:29,390
Pepi, with her calculator,
will give us the results.

315
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:31,510
Ready, guys?

316
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:35,110
Are those bodies ready?
Pepi, are you ready?

317
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:39,110
Fantastic. Then let's begin
"General Erections"!

318
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:44,150
- Where are you going?
- To shave.

319
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:48,710
- That's a shame. It suits you.
- Not that you'd notice.

320
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:04,830
Eighteen...

321
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:07,390
...by six...

322
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:11,750
One hundred and eight!

323
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:14,310
Toni...

324
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:17,150
Fifteen by...

325
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:18,830
...five...

326
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:24,910
Seventy-five!

327
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:29,350
Sixteen and a half...

328
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:32,190
...by six...

329
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:36,790
Ninety!

330
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:43,110
What's this?

331
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:45,030
Am I dreaming?

332
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:46,470
Delirious?

333
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:48,790
Is this reality I see before me,

334
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:51,630
or is it an illusion?

335
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:54,950
Help me, I can hardly breathe.

336
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:57,710
Moncho...

337
00:28:57,790 --> 00:28:59,710
Twenty...

338
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:02,470
...by nine...

339
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:05,790
Two hundred and twenty points!

340
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:27,270
Ladies and gentlemen...

341
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:31,910
I give you...

342
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:37,950
I give you tonight's winner...

343
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:39,230
Moncho!

344
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:03,590
I knew that if I just
fixed myself up a little bit...

345
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:12,030
And now, the prize giving.

346
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:16,990
What do you want to do, and with whom?

347
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:21,830
Your desires are our to fulfil.

348
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:36,270
I want Luci to suck it.

349
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:41,030
It won't bite you.

350
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:45,350
Go on. Eat before it gets cold.

351
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:04,750
That's enough! Some of us want to sleep!

352
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:08,510
Don't stop. No one can ear you.

353
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:12,950
PEPI, LUCI AND BOM

354
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:15,470
Shit, I'm useless.

355
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:19,670
If I want to be a writer,
I'll have to learn.

356
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:27,910
- Yes?
- Pepi?

357
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:30,990
- Hi, Dad.
- Speak up, I can't hear you.

358
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:35,590
I've got a face mask on,
so I can't move my face.

359
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:38,630
I was going to call.
I haven't had my cheque.

360
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:40,510
That's what I wanted to tell you.

361
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:44,950
I'll send a cheque to cover
your rent and bills, but no more.

362
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:48,670
It's for your own good. You're old
enough to make your own living.

363
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:53,670
I am. I'm writing stories.
And loads more you don't know about.

364
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:55,670
I mean something more practical.

365
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:59,510
I've spoken to Sr Velasquez. He says
you can work for him if you want.

366
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:01,910
I told you, I don't want to be a secretary.

367
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:04,030
And anyway...

368
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:06,350
- I've got a job.
- Really? What is it?

369
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:09,910
GIRLS WITH IMAGINATION
ADVERTISING AGENCY

370
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:14,350
- A creative in an adverting agency.
- What's that?

371
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:18,430
I have to... come up with advertisements.

372
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:20,710
It's well paid and it suits me.

373
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:22,750
You're not lying to me again?

374
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:25,750
Me? Didn't you say
I had a lot of imagination?

375
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:28,350
Well, now I'm making a living from it.

376
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:30,430
You can't go on like this.

377
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:33,790
Listen, we've talked long enough.
Sorry, Dad, goodbye.

378
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:37,110
Work...

379
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:39,670
And a change. It's obvious.

380
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:46,590
I'd prepared everything so that
the afternoon would be perfect

381
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:50,790
He brought champagne
to celebrate our meeting.

382
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:56,350
Then something terrible
ad unexpected happened.

383
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:59,270
Is something wrong?

384
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:02,590
- I really need to fart.
- Go right ahead.

385
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:05,510
PUTON panties contain a substance

386
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:09,710
which transforms the smell of your fart
into an elegant perfume.

387
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:23,230
What delicious perfume you're wearing.
What's it called?

388
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:26,470
It's a woman's secret.

389
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:35,830
- Can I help you, miss?
- I'm in a terrible hurry.

390
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:38,110
Tell me what's wrong. Maybe I can help.

391
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:40,590
I need to pee so badly I could die.

392
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:41,670
Really?

393
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:45,750
Every time I enter a lift
or a phone box, I need to pee.

394
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:49,270
- Does it happen to you?
- Sometimes, but it's no great tragedy.

395
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:54,470
PUTON panties are made from fibres
which completely absorb your urine

396
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:59,830
and change their colour,
as though you'd put on a new pair.

397
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:24,390
There are times when solitude
is our greatest enemy.

398
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:29,670
PUTON panties, carefully rolled,

399
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:34,270
acquire a consistency which,
in the absence of anything better,

400
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:37,750
can fulfil the role
of a passionate companion.

401
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:42,590
PUTON panties
FOR ALL EVENTUALITIES

402
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:49,230
It's not because it's mine,
but I love it.

403
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:51,670
- It's just the way you wanted it.
- Exactly.

404
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:54,830
- Let's see what the client says.
- I'll deal with that.

405
00:34:54,910 --> 00:34:58,870
- She's a bit of a dolly bird.
- She's perfect for this.

406
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:01,630
- But the guy couldn't be better.
- True.

407
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:05,430
I loved it. It's beautiful.
And the plants are gorgeous.

408
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:07,310
This is our audience.

409
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:11,390
It's a shame the panties don't work,
since I'm constantly peeing.

410
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:14,750
- Luci knows all about that.
- Oh, yes!

411
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:17,030
Bom, we should be going.

412
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:20,590
I'll come with you.
I've got an interview next door.

413
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:22,830
- See you later.
- Bye.

414
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:27,350
Advertising's your thing.

415
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:30,270
You think so?
I have an interview with a capitalist.

416
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:33,630
Is it about manufacturing dolls
with pussies and periods?

417
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:36,180
If it goes well,
I'll produce your record.

418
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:39,430
That would be fantastic.
The dolls are a brilliant idea.

419
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:41,110
Let's hope they think so too.

420
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:44,150
They're hard nuts to crack
and I need to persuade them.

421
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:51,150
- When are you going to Cuenca?
- This afternoon.

422
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:54,910
- What are you doing?
- She's coming with us, of course.

423
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:56,870
I'm going home to get my clothes.

424
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:59,590
I don't know what I'll do
if my husband's there.

425
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:03,510
Make a scene. Tell him
you're leaving because he raped me.

426
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:06,630
I'm annoyed we thought
your brother-in-law was him.

427
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:09,830
I'm still a bit mad with him.

428
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:11,030
He's a coward.

429
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:14,910
I don't think he'll dare do anything
if I say I'm leaving.

430
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:18,950
- Well, my capitalist lives over there.
- Good luck.

431
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:22,630
Remember to write down everything,
real and imagined.

432
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:24,910
and take photos, for my story.

433
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:26,310
Don't worry.

434
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:28,310
- Bye.
- See you later.

435
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:32,430
Silly!

436
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:34,310
Girl!

437
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:36,870
- Bye, Pepi!
- Come on.

438
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:42,590
I told you to stop those knitting classes
or I'll tie you to the bed.

439
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:45,470
Not a bad idea,
but I don't give a shit what you say.

440
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:49,710
What sort of language is that?
What would my poor mother say?

441
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:56,030
And another thing. Where's the money?
Or do you do it for free?

442
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:58,310
- I'm paying a debt of yours.
- Mine?

443
00:36:58,390 --> 00:37:02,590
Yes! You should know that
my pupil is the girl you raped.

444
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:06,430
She wanted to sell her virginity
but since you ruined her plans,

445
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:10,350
I'm helping her to make jerseys
so she can make money on the market.

446
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:13,550
You're crazy. Someone's
filled your head with nonsense.

447
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:15,950
Don't you realise you're a victim?

448
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:19,630
Yes, a victim of the wave of eroticism
sweeping the country.

449
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:21,190
So what?

450
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:23,270
Eroticism?

451
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:26,910
- What have you done?
- All sorts.

452
00:37:26,990 --> 00:37:30,910
I'm going on tour with Bomitoni Group.
I'm their groupie.

453
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:35,230
You're a groupie
for that bunch of degenerates?

454
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:36,830
You don't know me.

455
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:40,350
Pity I didn't get to know you earlier.

456
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:41,950
Luciana,

457
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:45,190
if you go out that door,
I'll bang you all up.

458
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:48,870
You'd be doing me a favour.
You've got to have fun in life

459
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:51,790
and apparently,
life in prison can be very lively.

460
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:55,630
- I'm going to get my things.
- You're not taking anything.

461
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:59,430
Fine. It'll be a weight off my shoulders.

462
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:12,110
But isn't there any way I can
force my wife to come back home?

463
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:14,230
It's quite clear.

464
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:17,190
There's no law to stop
a woman married to a policeman

465
00:38:17,310 --> 00:38:20,270
becoming a groupie overnight.

466
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:21,470
OK.

467
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:26,141
If you go to court, you'll have every
feminist in the country on your back.

468
00:38:26,151 --> 00:38:28,390
I'm sorry, but that's the way it is.

469
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:30,430
Thanks.

470
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:36,830
THE POLICEMAN
ALSO KNEW HOW IT FELT

471
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:39,990
TO BE HUNGRY FOR REVENGE

472
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:24,870
- Arrested!
- Don't shout. I'm not deaf.

473
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:26,870
Can I ask why I'm being arrested?

474
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:30,070
What about the plant?
You, get the plant.

475
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:33,350
It's there as a decoration.
I didn't know it was a crime.

476
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:35,870
- It's plastic.
- It cost me 15,000 ptas.

477
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:37,870
Plastic? Bring it here!

478
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:45,230
Don't you know it's forbidden
to make fun of the police?

479
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:48,350
Don't you know that
plastic plants are fashionable?

480
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:50,430
Let's go.

481
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:04,270
They're always on the go.
They go swimming, sailing,

482
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:08,270
they go to discotheques,
they hardly sleep.

483
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:11,430
The usual thing for young people.
Lots of free time,

484
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:14,230
and lots of wonderful energy.

485
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:16,310
Ana Lorenz, let's see now.

486
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:19,190
What about people
who stay in the city?

487
00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:23,790
All the restaurants have the "Closed
for Holidays" sign in the window.

488
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:27,110
It can be a big problem, can't it?

489
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:31,310
Yes. I think it will be less
of a problem this year, because...

490
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:35,390
- Hello. Is Luci in?
- No.

491
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:39,190
I haven't seen her for days.
She's not ill, is she?

492
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:41,070
No, no.

493
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:46,270
She moved to Parque de Lisboa.

494
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:48,070
The new flat?

495
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:52,070
You're confusing me
with my brother. I'm Juan.

496
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:54,430
Juan?

497
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:56,950
I didn't realise.

498
00:40:57,070 --> 00:40:59,830
- Come in.
- Silly me!

499
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:03,590
How lovely.
Aren't I an idiot?

500
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:06,590
Of course, since I'm wearing
his dressing gown.

501
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:08,830
Oh, yes.

502
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:13,790
Luci didn't even say goodbye.

503
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:18,790
You know what her husband's like.
He probably wouldn't let her.

504
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:22,950
Luci and I are very good friends.

505
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:25,830
I'm very sad she's gone.

506
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:27,830
- I'm not.
- No?

507
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:29,830
- No.
- Why?

508
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:31,670
I'm a bachelor.

509
00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:35,070
And bachelors have other needs.

510
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:38,350
- Are you going to stay here?
- Yes.

511
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:40,790
Didn't Luci say anything?

512
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:44,510
She was supposed to ask you to call me.

513
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:49,430
No. But so what?
I've thought a lot about you.

514
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:53,510
- Really?
- Charito...

515
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:57,590
Angel... Darling...

516
00:41:57,670 --> 00:42:01,070
- I like you very much, you know.
- No, please, no.

517
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:06,230
Afterwards, you won't respect me.

518
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:08,830
You'll say I'm like all the rest.

519
00:42:08,950 --> 00:42:11,630
Look what you've done to me.
Wait a minute.

520
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:14,030
You'll see.

521
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:15,830
No, please.

522
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:18,590
You won't feel a thing.

523
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:22,030
- Don't take my clothes off.
- OK, I won't.

524
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:24,190
But let me feel your legs.

525
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:26,510
Even if it's only your legs.

526
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:28,510
Let me.

527
00:42:37,150 --> 00:42:41,270
- I've got 30 ptas. What have you got?
- I've got 50.

528
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:43,750
Not even 100 ptas.

529
00:42:43,870 --> 00:42:47,110
- If someone comes...
- They're playing tonight.

530
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:51,670
My friend Pepi is coming.
I really want to see her.

531
00:42:51,790 --> 00:42:55,590
Lot's of my friends are coming.
Don't you understand what I'm saying?

532
00:42:55,710 --> 00:42:59,870
- Why doesn't someone come?
- Here are some girls.

533
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:03,550
Girls never give you anything.
They keep it for themselves.

534
00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:06,310
Let's see if a boy comes.

535
00:43:06,390 --> 00:43:08,790
- Yes! Look!
- Here's a boy coming!

536
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:12,430
Come here, boy. Come here.

537
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:14,310
Can you give us some money?

538
00:43:14,430 --> 00:43:17,790
I'm going over there to have a beer.

539
00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:20,870
We just need enough for a ticket.

540
00:43:20,990 --> 00:43:23,750
How much have you got? Perfect!

541
00:43:23,870 --> 00:43:25,350
Bomitoni!

542
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:27,190
Bomitoni!

543
00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:29,070
Bomitoni!

544
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:38,950
You're a friend of Toni's, aren't you?

545
00:44:39,070 --> 00:44:41,070
He's told me a lot about you.

546
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:44,630
Sick it up, nobody will notice.

547
00:44:48,870 --> 00:44:51,030
I'm his cousin's neighbour.

548
00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:56,110
I've been drinking and smoking.
I'm on a real downer.

549
00:44:56,230 --> 00:44:59,590
Let's go for a walk. It'll do you good.

550
00:44:59,710 --> 00:45:01,110
OK.

551
00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:10,150
You must be happy.

552
00:45:10,270 --> 00:45:13,150
I'm so grateful to you
for introducing me to her.

553
00:45:13,270 --> 00:45:16,550
- I'm a new person.
- You look younger.

554
00:45:18,030 --> 00:45:21,750
I love you because you're dirty

555
00:45:21,830 --> 00:45:25,150
Filthy, slutty and servile

556
00:45:25,230 --> 00:45:29,190
You're Murcia's most obscene

557
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:33,070
And you're all mine

558
00:45:44,510 --> 00:45:47,630
I love you because you're dirty

559
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:49,990
Filthy, slutty and servile

560
00:45:50,110 --> 00:45:52,790
You're Murcia's most obscene

561
00:45:52,910 --> 00:45:55,510
And you're all mine

562
00:45:57,310 --> 00:45:59,270
I only think of you

563
00:45:59,350 --> 00:46:00,910
Murcia girl!

564
00:46:00,990 --> 00:46:02,790
Because you are...

565
00:46:02,910 --> 00:46:04,270
...a slag!

566
00:46:20,590 --> 00:46:23,390
I put my finger in your crack

567
00:46:23,470 --> 00:46:26,110
I give you a couple of slaps

568
00:46:26,230 --> 00:46:28,550
Force you to make me come

569
00:46:28,670 --> 00:46:31,270
I'm worse than a terrorist

570
00:46:31,390 --> 00:46:34,990
I only think of you...

571
00:46:35,110 --> 00:46:36,190
Murcia girl!

572
00:46:36,270 --> 00:46:38,190
Because you are...

573
00:46:38,310 --> 00:46:40,430
...a slag!

574
00:46:41,550 --> 00:46:45,430
That big poof is from my village.
Toni, how's it going?

575
00:46:47,470 --> 00:46:49,830
He's lovely. He's got a different style.

576
00:46:49,950 --> 00:46:52,950
I'm a model. I suppose you realised.

577
00:46:53,070 --> 00:46:57,790
My agent told me that I might
have a chance. I probably will...

578
00:46:57,870 --> 00:47:00,350
Would you give me your phone number?

579
00:47:00,470 --> 00:47:02,910
My phone number? Who do you think I am?

580
00:47:03,110 --> 00:47:05,181
And take your hand off.

581
00:47:05,191 --> 00:47:07,270
See? They're all the same.

582
00:47:07,390 --> 00:47:10,110
I fit you just like a glove

583
00:47:10,230 --> 00:47:12,950
You get off when we make love

584
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:15,350
If I fart into your mouth

585
00:47:15,470 --> 00:47:18,070
You give me a round of applause

586
00:47:19,470 --> 00:47:21,510
You belong to me

587
00:47:22,030 --> 00:47:22,990
Murcia girl!

588
00:47:23,110 --> 00:47:25,190
Because...

589
00:47:25,270 --> 00:47:28,110
...that's what I want!

590
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:45,470
It's disgusting, but so what?

591
00:47:45,550 --> 00:47:49,950
You get dolls that suck milk bottles,
that pee, that poo, everything.

592
00:47:50,030 --> 00:47:54,990
None of them sweat and bleed
and that's the doll for this Christmas.

593
00:47:55,070 --> 00:47:56,830
NO FILMING ON SUNDAYS

594
00:47:56,910 --> 00:48:00,590
We're going to the country on Sunday
so you can use the camera.

595
00:48:04,150 --> 00:48:08,950
I'm a month behind and I need
a definite answer as soon as possible.

596
00:48:09,030 --> 00:48:12,790
That's the way we do business, quickly.
Just a minute.

597
00:48:12,910 --> 00:48:14,990
I can't make out all the corrections.

598
00:48:15,070 --> 00:48:17,470
The boy says, "I want Luci to suck it".

599
00:48:17,590 --> 00:48:20,830
And Bom says,
"Go on, eat before it gets cold."

600
00:48:20,950 --> 00:48:23,350
- Thanks.
- That was my secretary.

601
00:48:23,510 --> 00:48:27,790
Listen, we can take the angle of
bisexual education and personal hygiene.

602
00:48:27,830 --> 00:48:30,870
Some people think children
are mentally retarded.

603
00:48:31,030 --> 00:48:33,550
But some of them aren't.

604
00:48:33,630 --> 00:48:38,670
If you like the idea, maybe you
can persuade your colleagues...?

605
00:48:42,230 --> 00:48:46,270
I'm going to look for funding elsewhere
I don't think I can rely on you.

606
00:48:46,350 --> 00:48:49,390
Well, call me whenever you want. Bye...

607
00:48:50,670 --> 00:48:54,350
The detergent people don't like
the reference to bridal purity.

608
00:48:54,470 --> 00:48:56,550
What a day.

609
00:48:56,670 --> 00:48:59,030
Paco says he wants to discuss it.

610
00:48:59,190 --> 00:49:01,790
Not today. Tell him tomorrow.

611
00:49:01,830 --> 00:49:03,990
- Say I've gone out to do something.
- OK.

612
00:49:04,110 --> 00:49:09,270
If I stay here any longer
I'll have a nervous breakdown.

613
00:49:09,350 --> 00:49:10,750
I'm not surprised.

614
00:49:10,870 --> 00:49:12,630
- Is this OK now?
- Great.

615
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:15,430
If there's anything urgent then...

616
00:49:52,550 --> 00:49:54,630
I wonder who that is.

617
00:49:58,590 --> 00:50:00,630
- Surprise!
- What are you doing here?

618
00:50:00,710 --> 00:50:03,150
- Pepi! How are you?
- I'm fine.

619
00:50:03,230 --> 00:50:06,270
- I bought you a present.
- You shouldn't have.

620
00:50:06,350 --> 00:50:09,190
You deserve it.
And I think you'll like it.

621
00:50:09,310 --> 00:50:12,110
I think I'm going to love it.

622
00:50:12,230 --> 00:50:14,070
- Hi everyone.
- Hi, Pepi.

623
00:50:14,190 --> 00:50:16,470
Wow, they're so big.

624
00:50:16,550 --> 00:50:19,190
- You like them?
- They're fantastic.

625
00:50:19,310 --> 00:50:21,990
- Very good.
- They're so pretty.

626
00:50:22,110 --> 00:50:25,110
This really achieves a certain...
What can I say?

627
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:28,350
You know what I mean, don't you?
This is a real success.

628
00:50:28,430 --> 00:50:31,230
I can help you through the agency.

629
00:50:31,310 --> 00:50:33,070
You're all sweaty.

630
00:50:33,150 --> 00:50:35,390
- How's the boxing?
- It keeps me fit.

631
00:50:35,470 --> 00:50:37,550
Why does she bother? It's exhausting.

632
00:50:37,670 --> 00:50:40,830
- She's at it all day. What about me?
- Shut up, stupid.

633
00:50:40,950 --> 00:50:43,310
Can I have a drink? I'm thirsty.

634
00:50:43,430 --> 00:50:46,350
- Luci?
- I'll get it.

635
00:50:46,470 --> 00:50:48,830
She's under your thumb. Come on.

636
00:50:50,990 --> 00:50:54,190
- I've got some coke. Want some?
- I don't feel like it.

637
00:50:54,310 --> 00:50:58,710
What are you like?
I'll keep some for Luci, she'll want it.

638
00:51:00,790 --> 00:51:05,070
I've got the agency's cameras
so we can shoot the video this weekend.

639
00:51:05,150 --> 00:51:07,310
Are you serious about filming us?

640
00:51:07,430 --> 00:51:11,190
Of course. Now I've got the cameras,
I'd better use them.

641
00:51:11,270 --> 00:51:14,590
Pepi, what gorgeous women
you've brought me.

642
00:51:14,710 --> 00:51:18,070
- I knew it.
- My God.

643
00:51:18,150 --> 00:51:20,470
I've never seen anything like it.

644
00:51:20,550 --> 00:51:22,030
Careful.

645
00:51:23,310 --> 00:51:26,510
Look at her.
Happy as a kid in a sweet shop.

646
00:51:26,630 --> 00:51:29,230
Do you want a line? Here you are.

647
00:51:29,350 --> 00:51:31,790
You never say no, do you?

648
00:51:31,910 --> 00:51:37,110
I was just telling Bom, we're
going to film our story this weekend.

649
00:51:37,230 --> 00:51:39,910
- You want me to be into it too?
- Of course.

650
00:51:39,990 --> 00:51:42,670
I'm not sure...
I've never done it before.

651
00:51:42,750 --> 00:51:45,390
Don't worry,
I'll make sure you'll do it right.

652
00:51:45,470 --> 00:51:49,070
You're only playing yourselves, after all.

653
00:51:49,230 --> 00:51:51,150
I'm looking forward to it.

654
00:51:51,230 --> 00:51:52,790
You'll have to do what I say.

655
00:51:52,910 --> 00:51:55,350
As well as being yourselves, you have to act.

656
00:51:55,430 --> 00:51:56,910
What do you mean?

657
00:51:57,030 --> 00:52:00,190
You can't just go like this
to the camera.

658
00:52:00,230 --> 00:52:04,350
As well as being yourselves,
you'll have to represent your characters,

659
00:52:04,430 --> 00:52:07,630
and representation is always artificial.

660
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:08,950
I don't understand.

661
00:52:09,070 --> 00:52:12,910
For example, you're a forty something
housewife, married to a cop...

662
00:52:13,030 --> 00:52:16,990
- Are you listening to me?
- I'm putting a comb on the angel.

663
00:52:17,030 --> 00:52:20,350
So, you're a housewife
but you really like to party.

664
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:21,990
So you have to show that.

665
00:52:22,070 --> 00:52:25,950
I've seen you being slapped
and eating snot without turning a hair.

666
00:52:26,070 --> 00:52:27,910
I don't know.

667
00:52:28,030 --> 00:52:30,190
- And you like it?
- I love it.

668
00:52:30,270 --> 00:52:34,950
We have to show that. You eat snot
like it was a slice of bread.

669
00:52:35,070 --> 00:52:36,710
- That's how I am.
- Of course.

670
00:52:36,870 --> 00:52:39,750
But cinema isn't life,
cinema is falsehood.

671
00:52:39,870 --> 00:52:43,990
They use a machine to make rain,
because real rain can't be photographed.

672
00:52:44,030 --> 00:52:48,230
I'm including the scene where Bom
pisses on you, just as it happened.

673
00:52:48,310 --> 00:52:51,670
Do you remember? It was brilliant.

674
00:52:51,750 --> 00:52:55,550
So when she pisses on you,
you have to moan with pleasure.

675
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:57,870
Yes! Listen, like this...

676
00:53:00,150 --> 00:53:04,990
Yes, that's is more or less.
We'll rehearse, don't worry.

677
00:53:05,110 --> 00:53:08,950
If we don't do it,
people won't believe you're a masochist.

678
00:53:09,070 --> 00:53:12,190
You know I love to obey,
so I'll do whatever you say.

679
00:53:12,310 --> 00:53:14,990
You just need to exaggerate a little.

680
00:53:15,110 --> 00:53:17,790
And you too. Because you're...

681
00:53:17,870 --> 00:53:19,430
- You're 15.
- 16.

682
00:53:19,550 --> 00:53:23,110
You look much older. But what's funny
is if you look at your age,

683
00:53:23,230 --> 00:53:26,310
because you're
a forty something policeman's wife

684
00:53:26,390 --> 00:53:29,510
and you're a 16- year-old punk singer.

685
00:53:29,670 --> 00:53:33,310
- It's itchy.
- Here we go again.

686
00:53:33,390 --> 00:53:35,030
You're crazy.

687
00:53:35,190 --> 00:53:38,830
I know you're violent
and perverted and so on,

688
00:53:38,910 --> 00:53:43,350
but you don't look like a sadist
so much as just unfriendly.

689
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:46,670
If I'm no good, find someone else
and leave me in peace.

690
00:53:46,750 --> 00:53:52,350
Don't be upset. It's supposed to be fun.
If it doesn't work it doesn't matter.

691
00:53:52,430 --> 00:53:56,190
Why don't we rehearse a bit?
Hey, Bom, hit me.

692
00:53:56,310 --> 00:53:58,350
Leave me in peace.

693
00:53:59,750 --> 00:54:02,790
- Shall we go out?
- Let's go clubbing.

694
00:54:02,910 --> 00:54:05,790
I'd rather stay here and watch TV.

695
00:54:05,870 --> 00:54:09,590
- Lighten up, girl.
- You and I can go.

696
00:54:09,710 --> 00:54:13,190
- You're always up for everything.
- Shall we get dressed up?

697
00:54:13,310 --> 00:54:14,510
Let's go!

698
00:54:28,590 --> 00:54:31,510
Is your brother-in-law still in the Canaries?

699
00:54:31,630 --> 00:54:35,670
I suppose so. He called before he left
but I haven't heard from him since.

700
00:54:36,830 --> 00:54:38,830
Is that waiter never going to come?

701
00:54:38,910 --> 00:54:40,390
Luci...

702
00:54:40,510 --> 00:54:43,230
- What?
- Get some beers.

703
00:54:43,350 --> 00:54:44,990
All right.

704
00:54:47,990 --> 00:54:49,670
How are you?

705
00:54:49,750 --> 00:54:53,950
- Is this the guy you told me about?
- No, a different one.

706
00:54:54,030 --> 00:54:57,310
- We've just got married.
- Really?

707
00:54:57,390 --> 00:54:59,910
- Quique, Pepi.
- Pleased to meet you.

708
00:54:59,990 --> 00:55:02,590
- He doesn't say much.
- He's mute.

709
00:55:02,710 --> 00:55:04,990
- He's good-looking though.
- True.

710
00:55:05,110 --> 00:55:07,790
Enjoy yourself.

711
00:55:07,910 --> 00:55:10,910
Did you see...?
You never join in, do you?

712
00:55:10,990 --> 00:55:14,230
It's so boring in here.
Have you seen the people?

713
00:55:15,430 --> 00:55:18,830
I never get bored.
I love watching everything.

714
00:55:18,910 --> 00:55:21,310
- You can get blood from a stone.
- A what?

715
00:55:21,430 --> 00:55:23,150
A stone!

716
00:55:38,110 --> 00:55:41,350
- Are you Bom, from Bomitoni group?
- Another pain in the neck.

717
00:55:43,750 --> 00:55:45,950
Don't come the star with me, twat.

718
00:55:46,070 --> 00:55:48,950
She loves being recognised.
Have a drink with us.

719
00:55:49,030 --> 00:55:52,270
- Yeah?
- I said to bring beers.

720
00:55:52,350 --> 00:55:54,910
I thought you said Coca-Cola. I got confused.

721
00:55:55,030 --> 00:55:58,790
- Where are the guys from the band?
- They're on military service.

722
00:55:58,870 --> 00:56:03,590
- I come from the same place as Toni.
- Really?

723
00:56:03,710 --> 00:56:06,670
- I'm an artist, too.
- What do you do?

724
00:56:06,750 --> 00:56:09,910
I'm a singer. Not like you,
a different style.

725
00:56:10,030 --> 00:56:11,710
Flamenco rock.

726
00:56:11,790 --> 00:56:13,590
- What?
- Flamenco rock.

727
00:56:13,710 --> 00:56:14,950
What's that?

728
00:56:15,030 --> 00:56:19,470
It's kind of like a ballad,
but international.

729
00:56:19,550 --> 00:56:22,310
- Is it hard?
- Well...

730
00:56:22,390 --> 00:56:25,270
Are you working anywhere?

731
00:56:25,390 --> 00:56:27,550
Let me speak. Are you working?

732
00:56:29,150 --> 00:56:33,301
I'm working in a bar to pay the rent,
but just serving drinks.

733
00:56:33,311 --> 00:56:35,590
- What did she say?
- She's working in a bar.

734
00:56:35,670 --> 00:56:39,310
- Just serving drinks.
- No one suggested anything else.

735
00:56:39,430 --> 00:56:42,070
My agent's promised me
a tour in the north.

736
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:46,110
Bilbao, San Sebastian, all around there.
I'll probably make a record.

737
00:56:46,230 --> 00:56:49,590
I might be able to help you.
I've got an agency.

738
00:56:49,750 --> 00:56:51,830
- Really?
- It's mine.

739
00:56:51,910 --> 00:56:54,110
Really? I'm a model.

740
00:56:54,230 --> 00:56:58,950
You might not have the sparkle
to be a model.

741
00:56:59,030 --> 00:57:01,030
What do you mean?

742
00:57:01,150 --> 00:57:05,030
Look at my hair. Think what an advert
I could make with that.

743
00:57:05,110 --> 00:57:06,510
- Maybe...
- What?

744
00:57:06,630 --> 00:57:08,790
- All right!
- Go on...

745
00:57:08,910 --> 00:57:11,950
Give me one of your cards.

746
00:57:12,830 --> 00:57:14,470
Here you are, twat.

747
00:57:14,550 --> 00:57:16,710
She's so refined!

748
00:57:16,790 --> 00:57:18,870
I'll call you.

749
00:57:29,470 --> 00:57:32,390
- Who's that?
- I don't know. Who is it?

750
00:57:36,030 --> 00:57:39,270
- She's gone.
- Go and fetch her.

751
00:57:39,390 --> 00:57:41,510
- What shall I say?
- Whatever you like.

752
00:57:41,590 --> 00:57:44,270
And buy me some fags. I've run out.

753
00:57:44,350 --> 00:57:46,110
All right.

754
00:57:46,190 --> 00:57:49,270
- Who's the dimwit?
- Her girlfriend.

755
00:57:51,190 --> 00:57:53,510
Some laugh.

756
00:57:55,830 --> 00:57:58,470
- Anyway... I'll call you.
- Sure.

757
00:57:58,590 --> 00:58:01,950
I want to get out of that bar.
Those guys get the wrong idea.

758
00:58:02,070 --> 00:58:06,310
I'm not old-fashioned. They can
touch my belly-button. But that's it.

759
00:58:07,870 --> 00:58:09,870
- The girlfriend?
- The girlfriend.

760
00:58:09,990 --> 00:58:11,150
Mine.

761
00:58:13,150 --> 00:58:16,750
- Anyway, I'll call you.
- Of course, whatever you like.

762
00:58:16,830 --> 00:58:17,950
OK.

763
00:58:56,670 --> 00:58:58,150
There you are!

764
00:58:58,270 --> 00:59:00,670
I told you to wait in the theatre bar.

765
00:59:00,790 --> 00:59:06,510
I'm going to lock you in my dressing-room
until the performance is over.

766
00:59:06,590 --> 00:59:10,230
If you escape again... You little devil.

767
00:59:10,350 --> 00:59:13,270
What am I to do with you?
The theatre'll throw me out.

768
00:59:13,430 --> 00:59:15,950
- I've got him.
- Thanks.

769
00:59:15,990 --> 00:59:18,750
Some friends of mine want to see you.

770
00:59:18,870 --> 00:59:21,030
- Me? What for?
- They like you.

771
00:59:21,150 --> 00:59:22,790
- Me?
- Yes, very much.

772
00:59:22,870 --> 00:59:25,710
- They're in a bar near here.
- Is it nearby?

773
00:59:25,790 --> 00:59:27,390
- Just here.
- OK. Let's go.

774
00:59:27,510 --> 00:59:30,790
- Don't hit him on the head.
- If he was yours...

775
00:59:30,910 --> 00:59:32,910
You women go too far.

776
00:59:32,990 --> 00:59:37,030
I wish he'd hurry and grow up.

777
00:59:37,110 --> 00:59:40,270
In you go, little one... After you.

778
00:59:53,350 --> 00:59:55,670
Here she is.

779
00:59:55,790 --> 00:59:57,390
Are these your friends?

780
00:59:57,470 --> 00:59:59,030
- Hello.
- So?

781
00:59:59,110 --> 01:00:03,510
We were bored and we saw you
dressed up like that.

782
01:00:03,630 --> 01:00:05,670
Stay with us.

783
01:00:05,790 --> 01:00:09,070
- I'm due on stage in five minutes.
- What play are you in?

784
01:00:09,190 --> 01:00:12,070
- The Lady of Camellias.
- Not Scarlett O'Hara?

785
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:15,430
Are you bored? You look terrible!

786
01:00:15,510 --> 01:00:20,230
I'll leave my son here to entertain you
and pick him up after the show.

787
01:00:20,310 --> 01:00:23,150
- I'm not bored.
- We can have a drink and talk.

788
01:00:23,230 --> 01:00:26,670
- Don't leave him here.
- Behave yourself.

789
01:00:26,790 --> 01:00:28,910
He's a charming boy. Look after him.

790
01:00:28,990 --> 01:00:31,470
Don't worry. Leave him here.

791
01:00:31,550 --> 01:00:34,550
- I want a sandwich.
- Just what we need.

792
01:00:34,670 --> 01:00:37,150
They don't do sandwiches.
Have a "Cuba Libre".

793
01:00:37,270 --> 01:00:39,030
- OK, a "Cuba Libre".
- Child!

794
01:00:39,110 --> 01:00:41,230
Some night this has turned out to be.

795
01:00:41,310 --> 01:00:43,670
- Have a look, sweetie.
- What now?

796
01:00:43,790 --> 01:00:45,950
- And my cigarettes?
- I forgot.

797
01:00:46,070 --> 01:00:49,790
- Well, go and get them.
- Enjoy yourself.

798
01:00:50,710 --> 01:00:54,230
Out into the street again. All right...

799
01:00:55,150 --> 01:00:57,150
Look, an artist,

800
01:00:57,270 --> 01:00:59,430
and the son of an artist.

801
01:01:00,350 --> 01:01:03,150
- What's up, kid?
- Leave me alone.

802
01:01:13,190 --> 01:01:15,340
- Why the hurry?
- What's it to you?

803
01:01:15,350 --> 01:01:19,310
Are you forgetting I'm a policeman?
I could arrest you right now.

804
01:01:19,470 --> 01:01:22,901
- I'm scared! Try it.
- OK. Let me see your papers.

805
01:01:22,911 --> 01:01:24,390
I haven't got any.

806
01:01:24,510 --> 01:01:28,910
Under the law, if you don't have papers
you can be fined 4,000 ptas.

807
01:01:29,030 --> 01:01:32,070
I'll shove that law up my hole.

808
01:01:32,190 --> 01:01:34,750
Really?
Tell me that down at the station.

809
01:01:34,830 --> 01:01:36,910
- Why?
- To the station!

810
01:01:39,190 --> 01:01:40,670
Coward!

811
01:01:40,750 --> 01:01:44,550
A proper husband doesn't need laws
to treat his wife the way he should.

812
01:01:44,630 --> 01:01:47,670
You know how good I am
at dealing out justice...

813
01:01:47,790 --> 01:01:51,030
- ...with my hands.
- You're all talk.

814
01:01:51,110 --> 01:01:52,470
That's why I left you.

815
01:01:52,590 --> 01:01:56,310
Really? You can forget all that
because you're coming with me.

816
01:01:56,390 --> 01:01:58,150
- OK?
- Where?

817
01:01:58,230 --> 01:02:00,950
Parque de Lisboa. No one knows us there.

818
01:02:01,070 --> 01:02:03,470
You'll have to kidnap me.

819
01:02:03,550 --> 01:02:05,910
What a good idea.

820
01:02:07,710 --> 01:02:10,430
You'll spend the rest of your life
tied to the bed.

821
01:02:10,510 --> 01:02:13,350
If only you had the balls.

822
01:02:13,430 --> 01:02:15,790
Shut up, you whore!

823
01:02:17,110 --> 01:02:20,550
You don't know what a whore
I am, you bastard.

824
01:02:22,870 --> 01:02:28,030
Tonight you'll pay for everything
you've put me through.

825
01:02:28,150 --> 01:02:30,630
Yes, I deserve it.

826
01:02:34,910 --> 01:02:37,470
- Communist!
- Fucking communist!

827
01:02:37,550 --> 01:02:39,710
Take that!

828
01:02:39,790 --> 01:02:43,310
- You like it, don't you? Take that!
- I like it!

829
01:02:49,190 --> 01:02:51,470
I'm going to strangle you!

830
01:02:57,590 --> 01:03:00,470
She's not coming.

831
01:03:00,550 --> 01:03:03,230
If she's gone back home,
I'll teach her a lesson.

832
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:08,190
She's trying to provoke you. You haven't
been giving her enough recently.

833
01:03:08,270 --> 01:03:13,110
Her little trick will backfire on her.
I'll come round to your house.

834
01:03:13,190 --> 01:03:17,190
Fine with me.
You could move in.

835
01:03:18,310 --> 01:03:21,110
I'm starving.
Let's get something to eat.

836
01:03:21,150 --> 01:03:26,110
It's a bit late to eat out,
but I can make you something at home.

837
01:03:26,230 --> 01:03:28,430
Where has that bitch got to?

838
01:03:28,510 --> 01:03:30,750
Don't think about her anymore.

839
01:03:30,870 --> 01:03:35,070
I used to like her, but recently
she's been a pain in the arse.

840
01:03:37,030 --> 01:03:39,830
This cod I'm making
is gong to be delicious.

841
01:03:39,910 --> 01:03:43,910
- Have you got the water?
- Pour it in very slowly.

842
01:03:44,030 --> 01:03:48,470
- Will you stir it?
- Of course.

843
01:03:48,550 --> 01:03:51,470
- I'm so tired.
- Me too, I'm dead.

844
01:03:51,550 --> 01:03:55,830
- I'm going to get a spoon.
- And the water goes in?

845
01:03:55,990 --> 01:03:59,110
Pour it in bit by bit, not all at once.

846
01:03:59,190 --> 01:04:02,270
- That's the secret.
- You're wonderful.

847
01:04:02,350 --> 01:04:05,390
I thought you might make me
an omelette or something,

848
01:04:05,510 --> 01:04:08,790
but cod with chillies and garlic,
my favourite dish...

849
01:04:08,950 --> 01:04:11,510
I'm really hungry too.

850
01:04:11,550 --> 01:04:15,190
I can't stop thinking about
how Luci left me standing there.

851
01:04:15,310 --> 01:04:18,150
She's got more of a hold on you
than you think.

852
01:04:18,230 --> 01:04:19,590
It's not that.

853
01:04:19,670 --> 01:04:23,110
With masochists,
you never know what to expect.

854
01:04:23,190 --> 01:04:27,990
She's probably having a great time suffering
because I'm not at home yet.

855
01:04:28,110 --> 01:04:31,190
I've told you, she's not right
for you. And you know it.

856
01:04:31,350 --> 01:04:35,270
- I've got used to her.
- That's the problem.

857
01:04:35,310 --> 01:04:38,270
In bed... it's incredible.

858
01:04:38,350 --> 01:04:41,870
That's what I don't get.
She looks like a mosquito, but...

859
01:04:41,950 --> 01:04:44,030
That's got nothing to do with it.

860
01:04:44,110 --> 01:04:48,670
If you didn't have such weird tastes,
you'd soon find a replacement.

861
01:04:48,750 --> 01:04:51,870
My tastes change as time goes by.

862
01:04:51,950 --> 01:04:56,030
When I was small, I used
to like women of over 50.

863
01:04:56,110 --> 01:04:58,830
Last year, I was into forty somethings.

864
01:04:58,910 --> 01:05:02,230
And now I wouldn't say no
to a woman of 35.

865
01:05:02,310 --> 01:05:04,950
If you go on like that,

866
01:05:05,030 --> 01:05:08,150
next year you'll be into 10-year-olds.

867
01:05:08,230 --> 01:05:12,110
Talking about replacements, if I leave Luci
what will you do about the film?

868
01:05:12,230 --> 01:05:14,670
I doubt that'll happen, but I'll replace her.

869
01:05:14,790 --> 01:05:16,590
I don't think she was an actress.

870
01:05:16,670 --> 01:05:19,510
Have you thought about
the end of the film?

871
01:05:21,230 --> 01:05:24,030
- Well...
- Tell me.

872
01:05:24,150 --> 01:05:28,390
You and Luci got married, both in white,
and I had a child by the policeman.

873
01:05:28,510 --> 01:05:31,670
You come and see me at the hospital
and I give you the baby,

874
01:05:31,790 --> 01:05:34,030
because you've set up home together.

875
01:05:34,150 --> 01:05:36,230
What an imagination you have.

876
01:05:36,310 --> 01:05:38,110
I had to have something.

877
01:05:38,190 --> 01:05:40,710
But I don't know.

878
01:05:40,790 --> 01:05:42,790
I'd like something more realistic.

879
01:05:42,910 --> 01:05:46,190
Anyway, I'm waiting to see
what happens between you two.

880
01:05:46,270 --> 01:05:50,870
How can we be such good friends,
and yet so different?

881
01:05:50,950 --> 01:05:53,790
I never wonder about things like that.

882
01:05:54,710 --> 01:05:56,470
Give me a kiss.

883
01:05:58,710 --> 01:06:00,790
- Look out.
- I'll spill it.

884
01:06:00,910 --> 01:06:03,910
- Are you embarrassed?
- That's why it was a quick one.

885
01:06:03,990 --> 01:06:07,430
- I'll clean it for you later.
- Clean it now.

886
01:06:07,510 --> 01:06:09,550
No, later.

887
01:06:21,710 --> 01:06:24,230
This transvestite's been all around Europe.

888
01:06:24,310 --> 01:06:27,630
- He's a star.
- Something like that...

889
01:06:27,710 --> 01:06:31,590
"I'm a hermaphrodite.
I was born with both sexes."

890
01:06:31,670 --> 01:06:35,990
I'm just the same.
I'm bored and feel like going out.

891
01:06:36,070 --> 01:06:39,470
- I'll be there in an hour and a half.
- That sounds great.

892
01:06:40,950 --> 01:06:43,870
Someone's at the door.
I'm going to see if it's Luci.

893
01:06:43,950 --> 01:06:46,830
Your favourite Avon lady's here.

894
01:06:46,910 --> 01:06:50,670
The sales lady with spunk,
all my clients are hunks.

895
01:06:50,790 --> 01:06:53,390
Well, hello, Francisco.

896
01:06:53,470 --> 01:06:58,350
I'm never so greedy
for a woman of breeding!

897
01:06:59,510 --> 01:07:03,950
Let's see, how are we doing?
Some place you've got.

898
01:07:04,030 --> 01:07:07,430
- What have you brought?
- The very best in cosmetics.

899
01:07:07,550 --> 01:07:09,590
It's the best. Look what I've got.

900
01:07:09,670 --> 01:07:14,070
A face mask made from
mixed vegetables, it's scandalous.

901
01:07:14,190 --> 01:07:18,910
What else have I got?
The best cocaine, heroin and acid.

902
01:07:18,990 --> 01:07:21,870
- It's not Luci.
- Who is it?

903
01:07:22,030 --> 01:07:25,750
Roxy, speeding as usual,
with cocaine for the boys.

904
01:07:25,790 --> 01:07:27,710
Ask her to keep me a gram.

905
01:07:28,670 --> 01:07:32,750
I don't even want to speak to her.
They're getting on my tits.

906
01:07:32,830 --> 01:07:36,270
I wish they'd leave me in peace.
I'll have to move out.

907
01:07:36,350 --> 01:07:41,070
- You have to stop being depressed.
- I'm worried about Luci.

908
01:07:41,150 --> 01:07:43,550
It's been two days.
I haven't heard from her.

909
01:07:43,630 --> 01:07:46,790
- She'll have found someone.
- I wouldn't be surprised.

910
01:07:46,870 --> 01:07:50,910
All we shared recently was a packet
of fags. But she could have called me.

911
01:07:52,190 --> 01:07:56,030
the doorbell. This time it'll be Luci.
I'll have such a go at her!

912
01:07:57,390 --> 01:08:00,710
A uniform! Come in, darling!

913
01:08:00,790 --> 01:08:04,830
How are you? I'm a Cinderella at heart.
An ordinary woman.

914
01:08:04,910 --> 01:08:06,870
Who's this woman?

915
01:08:06,990 --> 01:08:09,310
Wait, where should I start?

916
01:08:09,390 --> 01:08:12,830
- Can you sign, please?
- I'll sign for you right now.

917
01:08:13,790 --> 01:08:16,230
- Thank you.
- Signed and sealed.

918
01:08:16,310 --> 01:08:19,310
Don't you have
a little teleprinter somewhere?

919
01:08:19,390 --> 01:08:22,350
It's a telegram from Luci.

920
01:08:22,430 --> 01:08:24,350
Wait, I'll read it.

921
01:08:24,470 --> 01:08:28,750
"I'm well. I'm in hospital.
Come and see me. Luci."

922
01:08:28,830 --> 01:08:31,550
Something horrible must have happened.

923
01:08:31,670 --> 01:08:34,470
Don't worry, I'm coming over

924
01:08:34,590 --> 01:08:38,070
No, don't. I have to go and see her at once.

925
01:08:38,150 --> 01:08:40,390
Wait, I'll be there in half an hour.

926
01:08:40,470 --> 01:08:42,790
- All right.
- Keep calm.

927
01:08:42,870 --> 01:08:45,070
But hurry, please.

928
01:08:46,270 --> 01:08:47,350
Shit.

929
01:08:47,470 --> 01:08:49,510
- Stay with me.
- I'm on duty.

930
01:08:49,630 --> 01:08:52,270
Please, don't go!

931
01:08:52,390 --> 01:08:55,070
- Please, don't go!
- I'll call the police.

932
01:08:55,190 --> 01:08:57,150
- I need you
- Señorita!

933
01:09:00,110 --> 01:09:02,630
Come here, come inside.

934
01:09:03,750 --> 01:09:06,550
Come on, come and sit down.

935
01:09:06,670 --> 01:09:08,110
No, please, no.

936
01:09:08,230 --> 01:09:09,950
What's he like?

937
01:09:10,030 --> 01:09:11,430
What am I like?

938
01:09:11,550 --> 01:09:14,510
Try this new...

939
01:09:14,630 --> 01:09:17,590
...schizophrenic pussy.

940
01:09:17,670 --> 01:09:20,270
Schizophrenic pussy. Try it, darling.

941
01:09:20,350 --> 01:09:23,430
It's amphetamines, try it, baby.

942
01:09:23,590 --> 01:09:28,190
Luci, you've got so many medicines.

943
01:09:29,510 --> 01:09:32,910
- Have you taken any today?
- None.

944
01:09:32,990 --> 01:09:35,670
Shall I help you
to take a tranquilliser?

945
01:09:35,750 --> 01:09:37,870
No. Leave it.

946
01:09:37,990 --> 01:09:40,590
But you haven't taken any at all.

947
01:09:40,670 --> 01:09:44,350
I don't want to make a habit
of taking pills.

948
01:09:44,430 --> 01:09:46,590
I'd rather be in pain.

949
01:09:46,670 --> 01:09:49,830
She's so long-suffering.

950
01:09:49,910 --> 01:09:53,870
See what they've done to her
and she hasn't said a word.

951
01:09:53,990 --> 01:09:57,350
But you were very lucky, Luci.

952
01:09:57,430 --> 01:10:01,670
- At least they didn't rape you.
- No, that's true.

953
01:10:01,750 --> 01:10:04,510
If that ever happens to me,

954
01:10:04,590 --> 01:10:07,790
they can hit me as much
as they want, I don't care,

955
01:10:07,870 --> 01:10:09,470
as long as they don't rape me.

956
01:10:09,590 --> 01:10:10,990
Imagine,

957
01:10:11,070 --> 01:10:14,590
you spend your life keeping men at bay,
which isn't easy,

958
01:10:14,670 --> 01:10:18,830
and then some yobs come along
and it's all for nothing. What a joke.

959
01:10:18,910 --> 01:10:21,270
It just shows the state this country is in.

960
01:10:21,350 --> 01:10:25,070
No one cares what happens to an
honest woman walking down the street.

961
01:10:25,150 --> 01:10:27,710
Have you told the police?

962
01:10:27,790 --> 01:10:33,950
No. Unfortunately, Luci didn't see
the faces of any of the attackers.

963
01:10:34,030 --> 01:10:35,950
No?

964
01:10:38,110 --> 01:10:40,990
- I'd better go.
- Of course.

965
01:10:41,990 --> 01:10:47,070
If Juan comes, remember to tell him
I was asking after him.

966
01:10:47,190 --> 01:10:49,870
I haven't seen him for a few days.

967
01:10:49,990 --> 01:10:53,390
Goodbye, Luci. Look after yourself.

968
01:10:53,470 --> 01:10:57,790
- Thanks for coming to see me.
- The stitches won't leave a scar.

969
01:10:57,870 --> 01:11:01,790
Bye. Don't forget to tell Juan.

970
01:11:09,430 --> 01:11:12,950
She's so innocent.
She was born a fool.

971
01:11:13,030 --> 01:11:18,030
It was bad of you to take advantage
of her while I was away.

972
01:11:18,950 --> 01:11:22,510
I didn't think you were such a bastard.

973
01:11:32,390 --> 01:11:36,230
I was worried in case
she met the others here.

974
01:11:36,310 --> 01:11:39,470
Did you put the right address
on the telegram?

975
01:11:39,590 --> 01:11:42,070
Yes, don't worry.

976
01:11:45,830 --> 01:11:48,310
This must be them.

977
01:11:53,950 --> 01:11:55,830
Luci, what's happened to you?

978
01:11:57,150 --> 01:12:00,150
Nothing. You can see.

979
01:12:00,230 --> 01:12:04,430
What do you mean, nothing?
You look like a mummy.

980
01:12:04,550 --> 01:12:10,310
My husband. He kidnapped me and took me
to our new flat to persuade me...

981
01:12:10,390 --> 01:12:14,070
Tell him to go.
We want to talk to you in private.

982
01:12:14,190 --> 01:12:16,310
In your dreams, little girl.

983
01:12:17,030 --> 01:12:20,350
Call me that again,
and I'll scratch your eyes out.

984
01:12:22,070 --> 01:12:25,790
You should leave.
You won't like what we have to say.

985
01:12:25,870 --> 01:12:30,870
Don't worry.
I'm sick of dealing with sluts.

986
01:12:31,790 --> 01:12:36,310
- Tell him to go.
- I can't. He's a monster.

987
01:12:36,390 --> 01:12:40,510
You seem dazed. I think the beating
has affected your head.

988
01:12:40,630 --> 01:12:44,310
- what's wrong? You seem different.
- Nothing's wrong.

989
01:12:44,390 --> 01:12:47,830
You don't know me well enough yet.

990
01:12:47,950 --> 01:12:50,950
Don't push me, or I'll get mad.

991
01:12:52,350 --> 01:12:53,550
Keep calm.

992
01:12:53,670 --> 01:12:59,070
I'm much more of a slut than you think.

993
01:12:59,190 --> 01:13:02,910
And you're not as evil as you think you are.

994
01:13:02,990 --> 01:13:06,310
You couldn't give me what I deserved.

995
01:13:06,390 --> 01:13:11,270
Lately you'd been
treating me like your maid.

996
01:13:11,390 --> 01:13:13,430
I'm not complaining,

997
01:13:13,510 --> 01:13:17,030
but I think I deserved
something much worse.

998
01:13:18,030 --> 01:13:21,750
But look...

999
01:13:22,950 --> 01:13:26,110
He nearly killed me.

1000
01:13:26,230 --> 01:13:30,750
You hear her, little girl.
There's nothing you can do.

1001
01:13:30,870 --> 01:13:34,910
Choose between him and me.
This is your last chance.

1002
01:13:35,030 --> 01:13:39,750
When I married him,
I'd already made that choice.

1003
01:13:39,830 --> 01:13:45,070
Don't trust him, he'll go back
to treating you like his mother.

1004
01:13:45,190 --> 01:13:48,630
He hates me with all his soul,

1005
01:13:48,710 --> 01:13:53,710
and he can't forgive me for what
I've done to him these last months.

1006
01:13:53,830 --> 01:13:57,950
I'd be crazy to pass up
an opportunity like this.

1007
01:13:58,070 --> 01:14:01,070
- Stupid!
- Quiet, this is a hospital.

1008
01:14:01,190 --> 01:14:02,790
- Let's go.
- Anyway...

1009
01:14:02,870 --> 01:14:06,150
I want to thank you
for everything you've done for me.

1010
01:14:06,230 --> 01:14:08,310
Save your thanks.

1011
01:14:08,390 --> 01:14:11,830
If it weren't for you,
he'd never treat me like this.

1012
01:14:11,950 --> 01:14:15,950
- Be quiet, you've said enough.
- Let's go.

1013
01:14:16,070 --> 01:14:19,390
- This is beginning to stink.
- Thanks for the presents.

1014
01:14:19,510 --> 01:14:21,750
No problem.

1015
01:14:21,870 --> 01:14:26,350
I'll be coming round
to get my wife's things.

1016
01:14:26,470 --> 01:14:30,110
You can collect them tonight,
from the rubbish bin.

1017
01:14:34,830 --> 01:14:36,310
That's the end of it.

1018
01:14:36,430 --> 01:14:40,230
What fucks me off is seeing
that policeman laughing at us.

1019
01:14:40,350 --> 01:14:44,230
Forget about it.
They deserve each other.

1020
01:14:44,430 --> 01:14:49,781
- What will you do now?
- I don't know. I feel disorientated.

1021
01:14:49,791 --> 01:14:53,230
Why don't you leave those painters
like you were saying,

1022
01:14:53,350 --> 01:14:55,470
and move in with me?

1023
01:14:55,590 --> 01:14:58,350
- Are you serious?
- Of course.

1024
01:14:58,470 --> 01:15:02,470
I'm a girl living alone.
I need someone to protect me.

1025
01:15:02,590 --> 01:15:06,510
With your boxing,
you could be my bodyguard.

1026
01:15:06,630 --> 01:15:08,590
I'd be delighted to protect you.

1027
01:15:08,710 --> 01:15:11,230
Let's get your things right now.

1028
01:15:11,390 --> 01:15:13,230
You're an angel.

1029
01:15:13,310 --> 01:15:17,710
What's wrong now? Come on, cheer up!

1030
01:15:17,790 --> 01:15:21,550
If I move in with you
I'm not going to sponge off you.

1031
01:15:21,670 --> 01:15:24,430
I can't have a woman supporting me.

1032
01:15:24,550 --> 01:15:28,270
- I need to get money from somewhere.
- You've got your music.

1033
01:15:28,430 --> 01:15:33,710
Music? I don't have a band anymore,
they've all left. I've got nothing.

1034
01:15:33,790 --> 01:15:36,150
Pop's gone out of fashion.

1035
01:15:36,310 --> 01:15:39,510
I need a different style,
I don't know what.

1036
01:15:39,590 --> 01:15:43,430
I've already thought of that.
Why not sing boleros?

1037
01:15:43,550 --> 01:15:45,670
- Boleros?
- Yes.

1038
01:15:45,830 --> 01:15:47,990
- Like Olga Guillot?
- Exactly!

1039
01:15:48,110 --> 01:15:51,230
- I'd love to.
- That's decided then.

1040
01:15:51,310 --> 01:15:53,110
Do you think I can do it?

1041
01:15:53,230 --> 01:15:56,110
You've got soul,
and that's what's important.

1042
01:15:56,270 --> 01:15:59,590
I'll take care of the rest
and choose the songs for you.

1043
01:15:59,670 --> 01:16:02,550
So many changes in just one day.

1044
01:16:02,710 --> 01:16:05,870
Yes... Cheer up.

1045
01:16:05,910 --> 01:16:09,910
A new life is opening up before you.

1046
01:16:10,030 --> 01:16:12,150
And for you, too.

1047
01:16:12,270 --> 01:16:31,941
I hope so.

1048
01:16:31,951 --> 01:16:32,031
