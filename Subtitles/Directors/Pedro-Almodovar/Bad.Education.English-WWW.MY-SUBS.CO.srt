00:00:39,583 --> 00:00:43,749
BAD EDUCATION

2
00:01:51,166 --> 00:01:52,665
written and directed by
Enrique Goded

3
00:01:52,833 --> 00:01:56,290
"The current spell of icy weather
has claimed its first victim.

4
00:01:57,041 --> 00:02:00,040
A motorcyclist froze to death
on Highway4

5
00:02:00,583 --> 00:02:04,082
and drove for a further 90 km
after he was dead.

6
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:08,790
Two patrolmen flagged him down

7
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:11,790
and as he didn't react
they pursued him.

8
00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:13,832
They drove alongside

9
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,874
and rebuked him for his attitude.

10
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:19,749
As he didn't move
they realized something was wrong."

11
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,999
It seems incredible.

12
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:23,040
It's a wonderful image.

13
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:27,874
A dead young man drives
his motorcycle across the icy plain,

14
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:30,249
escorted by two patrolmen.

15
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:32,249
Where was he going
in that icy dawn?

16
00:02:33,833 --> 00:02:36,540
To see someone who couldn’t wait
until the morning.

17
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,165
There's a story here!

18
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:42,499
I'll cut it out and keep it,
it might inspire me.

19
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:47,790
I'll get it.

20
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:55,124
-Hello.
-What is it?

21
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:57,582
I'm an actor.
I'm looking for Enrique Goded.

22
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:58,874
He isn't here.

23
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:02,457
But I can see him, man.

24
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:06,582
In any case,
we don't have any projects, so...

25
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:09,540
I'd like to speak to him.
We were old pals at school.

26
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:11,540
I'm Ignacio Rodríguez.

27
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:14,624
-All right, come in.
-Thank you

28
00:03:14,916 --> 00:03:17,915
-I don’t think he'll see you.
-That's all right.

29
00:03:18,916 --> 00:03:20,165
Wait a minute.

30
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:24,040
He's an actor, a nuisance!

31
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:27,665
I told him
we aren't preparing a film now.

32
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:30,457
-Tell him I'm not in.
-I did, but he saw you.

33
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:31,499
And I can see him.

34
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:34,415
He said he was
a friend of yours at school.

35
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,207
-Who can he be?
-Ignacio Rodríguez.

36
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:40,290
Ignacio?

37
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:43,124
-It can't be!
-That's what he said.

38
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:49,957
Ignacio, is it really you?

39
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:51,207
Of course, Enrique.

40
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:54,582
-I'm delighted you remember me!
-How could I forget you?

41
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:57,915
Well, it's been sixteen years.

42
00:03:58,083 --> 00:03:59,790
-That long?
-More or less.

43
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,249
I wouldn't recognize you
with that beard.

44
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:06,290
You'd look better without it.
Come into my office.

45
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:08,749
-You want a coffee?
-No, thanks.

46
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:10,457
-I'm having one.
-Then,yes.

47
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:14,457
-Martín,will you make some coffee?
-Yes.

48
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:17,249
Sit down.

49
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:19,999
What brings you here?

50
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,499
I came to ask for work.
I'm an actor.

51
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:26,082
I've brought my resumé.

52
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:33,957
-Bumblebee Group.
-An independent theater company.

53
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:39,707
"El Retablillo de San Cristóbal"
by García Lorca.

54
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:45,624
"The Diary of Adam and Eve",
by Mark Twain

55
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:48,457
Mark Twain, García Lorca...

56
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:50,832
Only the best
for the Bumblebee.

57
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,749
Don’t you write anymore?

58
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:54,832
No, I stopped ages ago.

59
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,749
But I've brought my last story.

60
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:02,915
"THEVISIT"
by Ignacio Rodríguez

61
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,040
"The Visit"...

62
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:08,540
By the way, when are you starting
your next film?

63
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:11,707
-Well...
-I'll do anything.

64
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:15,749
We're eyeing tabloids
to see if I can think of stories.

65
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:18,374
You've caught me
in a creative crisis.

66
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:19,832
That's a bummer!

67
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:23,790
Read my story,
it might give you some ideas.

68
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:25,040
What's it about?

69
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:26,207
Our school.

70
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:29,249
One part is based
on our childhood,

71
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:33,332
and the other part isn't,
when the characters grow up.

72
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,290
That’s fiction

73
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:38,207
I haven't introduced you.
Ignacio, Martín...

74
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:39,957
Pleased to meet you

75
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:42,499
-Sugar and milk?
-Yes, please.

76
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,749
By the way,
I don't call myself Ignacio now.

77
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:46,874
I'm Angel.

78
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:48,415
Why's that?

79
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:50,332
It's my stage name.

80
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,874
An actor can’t be called
Ignacio Rodríguez.

81
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,082
-He can't?
-Of course not.

82
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,874
Angel Andrade.

83
00:05:57,541 --> 00:05:59,999
Everyone calls me that,
even my mother.

84
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:01,249
That's great.

85
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,749
Thank you

86
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:05,165
-Ignacio was...
-Angel!

87
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,790
-Ignacio...
-Angel!

88
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:12,790
Well, Ignacio,
before he became Angel,

89
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:15,874
was...
is an old school friend.

90
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:17,540
Martín is my production director.

91
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:18,832
And maid of all work.

92
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:21,415
-Well, Ignacio...
-Angel!

93
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:22,832
Right!

94
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:25,832
I'm delighted to see you

95
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,165
As soon as I've got anything...

96
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:30,540
Give me your number,
I'll call you.

97
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:32,207
I don't have a phone.

98
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,832
But I'll call you.

99
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,707
-Should I leave you another photo?
-No, don’t worry

100
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:41,457
Well, Angel,
i twas great seeing you.

101
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:44,707
-So should I go?
-Yes, I think so

102
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:49,249
-Can't I help you cut out...?
-No, thanks a lot.

103
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:53,249
-So long.
-My pleasure.

104
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,707
You look great!

105
00:06:58,416 --> 00:06:59,290
So do you.

106
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:03,040
-Do read"The Visit".
-Yes, I will.

107
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:06,040
-I'm dying of curiosity
-Great. See you.

108
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,999
I thought he'd never leave!

109
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:13,415
-Is he really a friend of yours?
-Yes.

110
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:16,749
I haven't seen him
since school.

111
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:18,874
We were really close

112
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:21,165
Well, he was my first love.

113
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:24,582
But he's changed a lot.

114
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:26,749
I didn't recognize him.

115
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:28,707
Will you see him again?

116
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:34,374
It seemed that you liked him.

117
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:37,999
No, there's nothing less erotic
than an actor looking for work

118
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,332
"The Visit".

119
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:47,915
Ever since we started touring
with the show,"The Bomb"

120
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,207
I've been waiting
for this moment.

121
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:54,499
Today we’re playing in the town
where I went to school.

122
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:58,499
I won't mention its name
so as not to promote it.

123
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,124
I owe my best memories
to the Olympo Cinema

124
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:04,207
which is now in ruins.

125
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,665
"THE BOMB"

126
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:30,249
Card.

127
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:37,832
-I'm fucking sick of losing!
-Then clear off

128
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:39,207
Take a break.

129
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:20,124
Thank you

130
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,957
She defines herself as

131
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:29,082
a mix of desert, hazard,

132
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:30,707
and cafeteria.

133
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:32,957
She's a great artiste

134
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:36,040
and a great friend of mine

135
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:38,665
With all of you,

136
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:40,040
our next act,

137
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:41,415
the mystery

138
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:43,124
and the fascination

139
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,040
of the one and only,

140
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:46,415
the inimitable,

141
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:47,832
Zahara!

142
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:50,499
A bit of applause,
for Crissake!

143
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:18,540
-So...
-What?

144
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:22,624
-Listen...
-I'll see you at the hostel.

145
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:25,290
-Yeah, but...
-Paquito, you heard me.

146
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,040
You've got time
for everything, fag.

147
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:33,165
Monda!

148
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:34,957
Wait for me, love!

149
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:40,957
Hello.

150
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:46,374
-What's wrong?
-I can’t find my keys.

151
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:49,249
May I help you?

152
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:50,582
Sure.

153
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:59,165
No, they're not here.

154
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:01,624
Let's see.

155
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:09,499
Not here either.

156
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:18,999
Here they are!

157
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,332
My lips are wearing out!

158
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:36,915
I drank too much.

159
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:39,332
You’re telling me.

160
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,540
Hey!
I'm sucking your dick!

161
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,207
He's out cold!

162
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,082
A kid.

163
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:31,082
Not a cent.

164
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:34,540
A lottery ticket
I'll keep that.

165
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:39,999
Don't start the engine
right outside.

166
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:42,749
But he's passed out!
Well hung, isn't he?

167
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:43,874
He's not bad.

168
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:46,332
And look he's still hard!

169
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:48,790
Love...

170
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:52,582
-Let me suck him off a bit.
-No,you've got things to do.

171
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:55,249
You've been at him for hours.
Look at your lip!

172
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:57,165
Come on,
the bike won't run away.

173
00:13:57,333 --> 00:13:59,249
Shut up!
Now, go hide the bike.

174
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,540
Hurry back I'll see you
in your room before 7:00.

175
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:06,540
Sure, I get all the dirty work
and you have all the fun

176
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:12,540
Now you get a hard-on,
asshole!

177
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:14,915
It's not fair!

178
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:20,040
Enrique Serrano.

179
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:26,624
Enrique!

180
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:35,415
Paquito!

181
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:40,124
Come up here!

182
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:41,624
What about the bike?

183
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:43,790
Leave it there
Come up.

184
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:50,082
There's nothing like
loading up on drugs

185
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:51,999
and on hormones

186
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:54,499
to end up
as crazy as you, bitch.

187
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:11,040
The keys!
We're not stealing the bike!

188
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:13,124
Why not?
We've got a buyer.

189
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:16,499
I'll explain later.
I'll meet you to go to mass.

190
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:19,665
-So we're going to the school?
-Yes, now more than ever.

191
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:22,207
-I'm flipping out, bitch!
-I bet.

192
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:11,040
Dear Enrique,
It's me, Ignacio.

193
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:14,207
I've dreamed so much
of this moment!

194
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,957
Years have gone by
but I've never forgotten you.

195
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:20,957
We have to meet again,
but when you're not plastered.

196
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:24,457
I want to tell you about my life
and hear about yours

197
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:27,165
while we eat a cream cake
in the Mallol Patisserie,

198
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:29,499
like when we got out of school
on weekends.

199
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:32,790
I'm not going
to complicate your life.

200
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:34,999
I know you’re married
and have a child.

201
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:37,957
I know that
you live in the next town,

202
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:41,290
that you’re broke
and that I'd like to help you

203
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:44,874
Right now,
I'm working on something,

204
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:48,082
but I'll explain it all
in the patisserie.

205
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:50,957
I'll wait for you from 6:00to 7:00.

206
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,582
Do come!

207
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:54,707
I adore you.

208
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:57,457
Ignacio.

209
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:55,374
-Yes?
-I miss you.

210
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:58,207
Have you unpacked
all the boxes?

211
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:02,124
Not even half of them.

212
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:05,957
Do you need a hand?
I don't mind, really.

213
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:08,457
It's best if you don't, Martín.
Thanks.

214
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:10,415
Can I call you later?

215
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:12,790
-I'm reading.
-Oh, do forgive me.

216
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:14,665
Don't be so fucking touchy!

217
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:18,540
-I'll call you in a while.
-Do that, even if it’s late.

218
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:29,707
We saw Sara's first films here.

219
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:32,332
And"Breakfast at Tiffany's"

220
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:36,040
Enrique and I groped each other
for the first time here.

221
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:41,665
My knees are trembling
just thinking about it.

222
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:49,040
I'm meeting him at6:00
in the patisserie.

223
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:52,124
Don't get your hopes up.
Remember, he's married.

224
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:54,665
If Fr Manolo
hadn't separated us...

225
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:56,290
What's he got to do with it?

226
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:58,040
A lot, everything!

227
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:01,624
That priest owes me a lot
and it's time for him to pay.

228
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:04,665
I hate seeing you like this

229
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:06,290
You got anything left?

230
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:08,624
What?

231
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:09,665
Speedball.

232
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,707
C'mon, let's have some!

233
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:14,249
-Here?
-Of course

234
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:16,915
They haven't
rolled out the streets yet.

235
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:18,499
Oh, fag!

236
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:19,999
Come on.

237
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:21,957
A nailful for my gal Paca.

238
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:30,040
One more.
I believe in couples.

239
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:32,624
Two fucks, two bumps,
two"amigas".

240
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:37,957
"Two Rode Together",
"Two For The Road".

241
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:41,624
You're such a pig!

242
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:45,249
Right, let's go to school!

243
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:46,832
Gee up, girl!

244
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:52,082
Come on, best foot forward.

245
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:57,874
This was my school.

246
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:01,832
I'm worn out.
Have you anything left?

247
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:03,207
Be quiet.

248
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:07,332
It's started.

249
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:12,665
The God of hope who,
by the grace of the Holy Spirit,

250
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:15,082
fills us with His joy and peace...

251
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:16,624
That's Fr. Manolo.

252
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:19,499
-He looks so old!
-Well, he's no chicken.

253
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:20,499
I guess.

254
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:22,790
Zahara, this is crazy!

255
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:25,040
Are you backing out, bitch?

256
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:29,665
But the chapel is tiny,
there's no where to hide.

257
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:31,707
When he sees us appear,

258
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,165
he'll do what Christ did
to the buyers in the temple.

259
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,999
He drove them outwith a whip,
and he was Christ!

260
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:40,499
So this man who, according
to you, is so imperfect...

261
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:47,832
I confess to God,
the Father Almighty,

262
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:49,915
and to you, my brethren,

263
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:53,290
that I have sinned
through thought, word,

264
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:55,082
deed and omission.

265
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:56,249
Through my fault

266
00:20:56,708 --> 00:20:58,665
-Through your fault
-Through my fault

267
00:20:58,833 --> 00:20:59,707
Through your fault

268
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:01,749
Through my most grievious fault.

269
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:05,124
So I beseech
the Blessed Mary, ever virgin,

270
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:07,457
the angels,the saints,

271
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:08,749
and you, my brethren,

272
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:12,207
to intercede for me
before Our Lord God.

273
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:15,915
Almighty God,
have mercy on us,

274
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:19,624
forgive us our sins
and lead us to eternal life.

275
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:21,832
Through Jesus Christ Our Lord.

276
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:23,499
We'll see.

277
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:25,165
The Lord be with you.

278
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:26,665
I could use Him.

279
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:29,040
May the blessing
of Almighty God,

280
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:32,415
Father, Son and Holy Spirit

281
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,499
descend upon you.

282
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:36,082
You may go in peace.

283
00:21:37,375 --> 00:21:38,290
I hope so!

284
00:22:07,541 --> 00:22:10,499
Go back to the dormitory
and sleep a bit more.

285
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:11,957
Thank you, Father.

286
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:25,415
If I'm in the sacristy
for too long, don't wait.

287
00:22:25,583 --> 00:22:28,249
We'll meet at the hostel
for lunch,

288
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:30,332
sweetheart.

289
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:36,415
Cute.

290
00:22:39,875 --> 00:22:41,040
Divine!

291
00:22:46,041 --> 00:22:47,457
Good morning, Fr. Manolo.

292
00:22:50,125 --> 00:22:52,874
What do you want?
You can't come in here!

293
00:22:53,041 --> 00:22:55,707
I'm the sister of an ex-pupil,
Ignacio Rodríguez.

294
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:57,832
You still can't come in here!

295
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,707
Don’t you remember him?

296
00:23:00,041 --> 00:23:01,957
We've had a lot of pupils

297
00:23:02,791 --> 00:23:05,415
But no one like Ignacio,
I'm sure.

298
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:08,624
I've brought
an important message from him.

299
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,499
He can give it to me himself.

300
00:23:11,166 --> 00:23:12,082
He can't.

301
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:14,499
He died in an accident.

302
00:23:17,666 --> 00:23:18,707
I'm sorry.

303
00:23:19,875 --> 00:23:21,374
Now, please go.

304
00:23:24,166 --> 00:23:25,165
Go away!

305
00:23:33,041 --> 00:23:34,415
-Hide!
-I've got it all!

306
00:23:34,583 --> 00:23:35,915
Hide, he's coming!

307
00:24:41,958 --> 00:24:43,374
Ignacio...

308
00:24:49,916 --> 00:24:52,290
I told you to leave!
What are you doing here?

309
00:24:52,916 --> 00:24:55,540
The same as you,
remembering Ignacio.

310
00:24:56,083 --> 00:24:56,874
Get out!

311
00:24:58,666 --> 00:25:00,249
We have to talk, Father.

312
00:25:00,625 --> 00:25:02,707
It'll only take a minute.

313
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:05,707
Say what you have to say
and go!

314
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:09,332
Are we going to talk in the dark?

315
00:25:10,666 --> 00:25:11,707
I don't mind.

316
00:25:12,125 --> 00:25:13,915
I'm used to working
in the dark.

317
00:25:14,083 --> 00:25:14,915
What do you want?

318
00:25:18,166 --> 00:25:19,874
A better life

319
00:25:20,375 --> 00:25:21,624
and a better body.

320
00:25:23,333 --> 00:25:25,749
What do I have to do
with those improvements?

321
00:25:27,416 --> 00:25:29,624
You could help me
finance them.

322
00:25:30,125 --> 00:25:32,165
I don't believe
Ignacio is dead

323
00:25:32,333 --> 00:25:33,874
or that you're his sister.

324
00:25:34,541 --> 00:25:36,540
I don't even believe
you're a woman.

325
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:44,082
Are you locking me in?

326
00:25:44,458 --> 00:25:46,790
I don't want anyone
coming in by mistake.

327
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:52,082
And now,
tell me why you're here!

328
00:25:52,375 --> 00:25:54,457
OK. I'll get to the point.

329
00:25:58,166 --> 00:25:59,540
It's a story by Ignacio.

330
00:26:01,166 --> 00:26:04,082
Yes, he took your advice
and kept on writing.

331
00:26:04,875 --> 00:26:06,957
I've got a friend,
a pig,

332
00:26:07,125 --> 00:26:08,499
who works at "Diario 16".

333
00:26:08,666 --> 00:26:11,374
He's very interested
in publishing this story.

334
00:26:11,916 --> 00:26:13,957
But first I'd like your opinion.

335
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:17,124
Apart from being
Ignacio's literature teacher

336
00:26:17,333 --> 00:26:20,249
you're one of the main characters
in this story.

337
00:26:23,583 --> 00:26:24,707
Read this.

338
00:26:26,166 --> 00:26:28,874
Each month, the boys
who got on the honors board,

339
00:26:29,041 --> 00:26:31,624
that is, the ones who got
the best grades,

340
00:26:31,791 --> 00:26:34,374
were rewarded
with a day in the country.

341
00:26:34,625 --> 00:26:38,249
We were always accompanied
by our literature teacher,

342
00:26:38,416 --> 00:26:39,874
Fr. Manolo.

343
00:26:47,958 --> 00:26:51,499
Moon River,

344
00:26:52,708 --> 00:26:56,040
always on my mind.

345
00:26:56,875 --> 00:27:03,624
I won't be swept away

346
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:10,665
by the water,

347
00:27:12,083 --> 00:27:15,790
the muddy water

348
00:27:16,583 --> 00:27:20,749
of that Moon River

349
00:27:21,708 --> 00:27:25,540
as it flows along.

350
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,290
River and moon,

351
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:35,124
tell me where to find

352
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:40,040
my God,
and good and ill.

353
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:43,624
Tell me.

354
00:27:45,375 --> 00:27:51,707
I'm longing to know

355
00:27:54,166 --> 00:27:57,374
what is hidden

356
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,832
in the dark

357
00:28:03,041 --> 00:28:06,290
and you'll find it...

358
00:28:07,333 --> 00:28:08,332
No!

359
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:24,915
A trickle of blood
divided my forehead in two.

360
00:28:25,083 --> 00:28:28,082
I had a feeling the same thing
would happen with my life.

361
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:32,124
It would always be divided
and I couldn't help it.

362
00:28:40,125 --> 00:28:41,999
Open the door, Father.
It is I.

363
00:28:53,333 --> 00:28:55,040
-What is it?
-There's been a robbery.

364
00:28:55,208 --> 00:28:57,207
-Where?
-In the chapel.

365
00:28:57,791 --> 00:28:59,457
I think it was
after your mass.

366
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:02,874
Were you missing anything?

367
00:29:04,125 --> 00:29:07,249
The chalice,the paten,
the jug,the cruets...

368
00:29:07,416 --> 00:29:08,832
They must be found!

369
00:29:09,583 --> 00:29:12,749
-The boys mustn't hear about it.
-Very well.

370
00:29:12,958 --> 00:29:15,415
And no one is to bother me,
except you.

371
00:29:29,166 --> 00:29:30,915
Was that Fr. José?

372
00:29:31,583 --> 00:29:32,915
Ignacio hated him.

373
00:29:33,458 --> 00:29:37,249
-Does he still hit the pupils?
-He never laid a hand on Ignacio.

374
00:29:38,541 --> 00:29:40,415
That was
the principal's privilege.

375
00:29:41,833 --> 00:29:44,665
To sum up,
I want a million in cash.

376
00:29:45,875 --> 00:29:49,040
Or else "Diario 16"
will publish the whole story.

377
00:29:49,541 --> 00:29:52,707
I don't have a million pesetas,
much less in cash.

378
00:29:52,875 --> 00:29:54,332
But you can get it.

379
00:29:55,833 --> 00:29:57,790
Now, if you don't mind,
I'm leaving.

380
00:29:58,291 --> 00:30:00,124
I've said all I had to say.

381
00:30:00,916 --> 00:30:03,124
But keep reading,
it gets better.

382
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,165
-The key.
-Wait.

383
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,790
Wait until after break time.

384
00:30:10,666 --> 00:30:12,290
It'll just be a minute.

385
00:30:13,791 --> 00:30:15,707
So you came to blackmail me.

386
00:30:17,125 --> 00:30:20,749
Tell Ignacio he's overrating
these pages. They're garbage!

387
00:30:21,583 --> 00:30:23,374
Garbage is hot!

388
00:30:23,625 --> 00:30:26,290
You and I make
a best-selling couple.

389
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:29,332
And the editor of "Diario 16"
knows that.

390
00:30:29,833 --> 00:30:32,249
You're in no position
to threaten anyone.

391
00:30:32,958 --> 00:30:35,415
People will believe me,
not you.

392
00:30:36,583 --> 00:30:39,707
No, people have changed.
This is 1977.

393
00:30:40,208 --> 00:30:42,874
This society puts my freedom
above your hypocrisy.

394
00:30:44,958 --> 00:30:48,040
If we treated Ignacio so badly,
why did he come back?

395
00:30:48,875 --> 00:30:51,540
Why didn't he report us
or change schools?

396
00:30:54,916 --> 00:30:57,290
He came back
'cause he'd fallen in love,

397
00:30:57,708 --> 00:30:59,457
with a classmate.

398
00:31:00,333 --> 00:31:01,957
Enrique Serrano.

399
00:31:02,375 --> 00:31:03,249
Remember him?

400
00:31:04,541 --> 00:31:05,415
Yes.

401
00:31:08,416 --> 00:31:10,082
Do you mind if I keep reading?

402
00:31:15,125 --> 00:31:17,665
There were lots of celebrations
at school.

403
00:31:17,833 --> 00:31:20,124
The most important one
was Principal's Day.

404
00:31:21,375 --> 00:31:23,915
That day, there were
sports competitions

405
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:27,040
and religious acts,
and we had a special meal.

406
00:33:30,083 --> 00:33:31,624
Come with me, Ignacio.

407
00:33:32,583 --> 00:33:33,790
Come along!

408
00:33:35,958 --> 00:33:38,624
-I haven't finished.
-You'll sing better that way.

409
00:33:48,541 --> 00:33:50,207
Do you know the new words?

410
00:33:50,541 --> 00:33:53,540
Yes, I've got the crib
Fr. Manolo gave me.

411
00:33:53,708 --> 00:33:55,582
Call him Reverend Principal.

412
00:33:56,208 --> 00:33:58,582
He's the school principal
from today.

413
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:00,832
-I know.
-Don't answer back.

414
00:34:02,208 --> 00:34:05,249
When you're singing,
keep looking at him,

415
00:34:05,541 --> 00:34:08,082
as if there were no one else
in the dining room.

416
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:10,582
-You understand?
-Yes.

417
00:34:12,875 --> 00:34:15,749
Fr. José placed me
in the center of the dining room.

418
00:34:15,916 --> 00:34:19,124
I felt odd in front of
all those priests drinking and eating,

419
00:34:19,291 --> 00:34:20,790
and I was a bit scared,

420
00:34:20,958 --> 00:34:24,165
but they all looked at me kindly,
except Fr. Manolo

421
00:34:24,333 --> 00:34:26,332
who looked ready to cry.

422
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,582
And now,

423
00:34:28,541 --> 00:34:30,124
Fr. José Manuel,

424
00:34:30,416 --> 00:34:32,249
as a birthday gift,

425
00:34:32,583 --> 00:34:34,040
Ignacio is going to sing

426
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,749
one of your favorite songs.

427
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:38,915
"Torna A Sorrento".

428
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:41,790
The new words,"Gardener",

429
00:34:42,375 --> 00:34:44,874
were written by Fr. Manolo,

430
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:46,874
helped by my humble self.

431
00:34:48,083 --> 00:34:49,582
When you're ready, Ignacio.

432
00:34:58,875 --> 00:35:02,249
Gardener, gardener,

433
00:35:03,208 --> 00:35:06,999
night and day
among your flowers,

434
00:35:08,333 --> 00:35:12,374
setting fire to their colors

435
00:35:13,375 --> 00:35:17,499
with the flame of your love.

436
00:35:19,375 --> 00:35:23,540
And you place in every calyx

437
00:35:24,375 --> 00:35:28,040
the smile of your yearning,

438
00:35:29,208 --> 00:35:32,832
with your eyes
turned up to heaven

439
00:35:34,458 --> 00:35:38,999
where all your hopes reside.

440
00:35:39,958 --> 00:35:43,332
And your flowers, gardener,

441
00:35:44,125 --> 00:35:47,832
with their corollas
burning brightly

442
00:35:48,541 --> 00:35:53,499
join together in gratitude

443
00:35:54,833 --> 00:35:59,790
and embalm you
with their scent.

444
00:36:01,375 --> 00:36:04,665
Continue with your labor,

445
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,374
cultivating all the flowers

446
00:36:10,583 --> 00:36:15,999
entrusted to your love

447
00:36:16,541 --> 00:36:21,249
by the Lord.

448
00:36:37,208 --> 00:36:40,707
-I thought you didn't like me.
-No,just the opposite!

449
00:36:40,958 --> 00:36:44,207
But every time I looked at you,
you looked away.

450
00:36:44,708 --> 00:36:46,749
Because you made me nervous.

451
00:36:48,708 --> 00:36:50,540
-And now I don't?
-No.

452
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,374
"THATWOMAN"

453
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,582
Come in.

454
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,582
May I help you?

455
00:37:10,541 --> 00:37:12,540
Don't you recognize me, Mother?

456
00:37:15,625 --> 00:37:17,624
Has the world
changed me so much?

457
00:37:19,041 --> 00:37:21,040
Mother Soledad!

458
00:37:24,416 --> 00:37:26,249
What are you doing here?

459
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,499
-I've come to stay.
-To stay?

460
00:37:30,083 --> 00:37:31,832
Sara is so beautiful!

461
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:41,457
In this house?

462
00:37:45,208 --> 00:37:46,082
No.

463
00:37:47,875 --> 00:37:49,207
Never.

464
00:37:49,791 --> 00:37:51,707
It's been a long time.

465
00:37:51,875 --> 00:37:54,999
Who can remember if I did something
I shouldn't have?

466
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:57,707
It's impossible.

467
00:37:58,333 --> 00:38:00,915
It is not God
who rejects you.

468
00:38:02,333 --> 00:38:03,707
It is I,

469
00:38:04,166 --> 00:38:05,832
in the name of my Order.

470
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:57,165
-What's wrong?
-I can't sleep.

471
00:38:58,125 --> 00:38:59,290
Neither can I.

472
00:38:59,958 --> 00:39:02,249
What we did in the cinema
wasn't right.

473
00:39:02,416 --> 00:39:04,582
-I liked it.
-So did I.

474
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:08,207
But I think it was a sin,
and God's going to punish us.

475
00:39:08,666 --> 00:39:09,749
God?

476
00:39:09,958 --> 00:39:11,540
I don't believe in God.

477
00:39:12,208 --> 00:39:14,624
-What do you believe in?
-I'm a hedonist.

478
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:17,999
-What's that?
-People who like having fun.

479
00:39:18,166 --> 00:39:19,874
I read it in an encyclopedia.

480
00:39:21,958 --> 00:39:23,249
What's the matter?

481
00:39:32,125 --> 00:39:33,457
You hear that?

482
00:39:34,166 --> 00:39:35,540
Fr. Manolo!

483
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:32,707
Open the door!
Or must I break it down

484
00:40:33,333 --> 00:40:36,082
and let the whole school
know what you're doing?

485
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:38,749
Ignacio!

486
00:40:40,083 --> 00:40:41,499
I know you're in there!

487
00:40:41,708 --> 00:40:43,332
I've seen your feet.

488
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:46,915
I can hear you breathing.

489
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:48,665
Ignacio!

490
00:40:51,916 --> 00:40:53,290
We're not doing anything!

491
00:40:58,791 --> 00:40:59,415
Get out!

492
00:40:59,875 --> 00:41:01,124
I'll deal with you later!

493
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:03,457
I'm not leaving Ignacio
alone with you.

494
00:41:04,041 --> 00:41:05,665
How dare you!

495
00:41:07,041 --> 00:41:09,082
Get out of here immediately!

496
00:41:10,833 --> 00:41:12,082
Enrique, please.

497
00:41:13,291 --> 00:41:14,457
Do as he says.

498
00:41:28,583 --> 00:41:29,332
Come here.

499
00:41:36,958 --> 00:41:38,457
What were you doing in there?

500
00:41:39,166 --> 00:41:40,124
Nothing.

501
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,457
Nothing?

502
00:41:45,041 --> 00:41:46,415
I swear, Father.

503
00:41:46,958 --> 00:41:48,832
Then why was the door locked?

504
00:41:53,583 --> 00:41:54,665
Come along.

505
00:41:56,375 --> 00:41:58,165
Come with me to the chapel.

506
00:42:08,708 --> 00:42:09,957
The bell!

507
00:42:10,833 --> 00:42:12,207
What are you thinking of?

508
00:42:17,666 --> 00:42:20,249
I think I've just lost my faith
at this moment,

509
00:42:20,416 --> 00:42:23,332
so I no longer believe
in God or hell.

510
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:27,290
As I don't believe in hell
I'm not afraid,

511
00:42:27,625 --> 00:42:29,915
and with out fear
I'm capable of anything.

512
00:43:14,791 --> 00:43:16,457
We'll for get this, Ignacio.

513
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:20,332
Even if I wanted to,
I can't stay angry with you.

514
00:43:21,083 --> 00:43:24,665
But promise that what happened
tonight won't happen again.

515
00:43:25,375 --> 00:43:26,499
And Enrique?

516
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:29,749
What about him?

517
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:31,290
Will he be punished?

518
00:43:32,416 --> 00:43:33,707
I should expel him!

519
00:43:35,291 --> 00:43:37,624
I'm sure he was
responsible for it all.

520
00:43:38,375 --> 00:43:40,124
No, I was.

521
00:43:44,166 --> 00:43:45,290
Don't cry.

522
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,582
He's a very bad influence on you.

523
00:43:50,666 --> 00:43:52,290
I want what's best for you.

524
00:43:56,916 --> 00:43:59,499
If you don't expel him
I'll do what you want.

525
00:44:00,541 --> 00:44:01,457
Hush.

526
00:44:05,708 --> 00:44:08,124
I sold my self for the first time
in that sacristy

527
00:44:08,291 --> 00:44:10,332
to avoid Enrique
being expelled.

528
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:12,457
But Fr. Manolo tricked me.

529
00:44:12,791 --> 00:44:15,832
I swore that one day
I'd make him pay for that.

530
00:44:21,750 --> 00:44:23,499
On your feet!

531
00:44:25,958 --> 00:44:27,374
Hands behind your head!

532
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:30,207
And, one!

533
00:44:31,041 --> 00:44:31,999
Change!

534
00:44:44,083 --> 00:44:46,957
Hurry up, Enrique!
We'll miss the bus!

535
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,582
I'm happy you came!

536
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:12,332
-You're better with out the beard.
-Thank you.

537
00:45:13,041 --> 00:45:14,082
What are you doing?

538
00:45:14,375 --> 00:45:16,540
I'm re-reading your story.

539
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:20,124
-Didn't you like it the first time?
-Of course!

540
00:45:20,416 --> 00:45:22,124
Just look at it.

541
00:45:22,916 --> 00:45:25,957
I couldn't help making notes.
Force of habit.

542
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:27,915
That's OK,
it's your copy.

543
00:45:28,625 --> 00:45:29,624
Thanks.

544
00:45:30,208 --> 00:45:32,540
Right, well...
How can I put this?

545
00:45:33,958 --> 00:45:36,707
I think there's a good film
in this story

546
00:45:37,291 --> 00:45:39,207
and I'd like to direct it.

547
00:45:40,958 --> 00:45:41,957
Really?

548
00:45:42,875 --> 00:45:44,499
You're not kidding me?

549
00:45:45,791 --> 00:45:47,415
I never joke about work.

550
00:45:47,791 --> 00:45:50,790
But first, tell me how much
you want for the rights.

551
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:53,624
What rights?

552
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,082
The story is yours!

553
00:45:55,250 --> 00:45:57,332
Do what you fucking want
with it!

554
00:45:58,166 --> 00:45:59,790
So you really liked it?

555
00:46:00,375 --> 00:46:03,499
I admit that when you said
it was based on our childhood

556
00:46:03,666 --> 00:46:04,707
I felt...

557
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,332
a bit apprehensive.

558
00:46:07,916 --> 00:46:09,415
But I was very touched.

559
00:46:10,541 --> 00:46:11,915
I'm so happy, man.

560
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:15,790
Remember I'm an actor
and I want out of Bumblebee.

561
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:17,290
Yes, I know that.

562
00:46:17,541 --> 00:46:19,457
You'd be perfect
as Enrique Serrano,

563
00:46:19,625 --> 00:46:20,874
naked on the bed,

564
00:46:21,041 --> 00:46:22,665
with Zahara's letter
on the pillow.

565
00:46:23,333 --> 00:46:24,582
Enrique Serrano?

566
00:46:25,916 --> 00:46:28,040
I think I'd rather play Zahara.

567
00:46:28,666 --> 00:46:29,790
Zahara, you?

568
00:46:30,125 --> 00:46:31,332
You're crazy!

569
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:33,582
-Why?
-Well...

570
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:37,874
You're too well-built.
You're not right.

571
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:39,999
Martín,we've got our story!

572
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:44,165
I can slim down!
I can get into the part!

573
00:46:44,333 --> 00:46:47,207
I'm used to that in the theater.
Like De Niro...

574
00:46:47,750 --> 00:46:49,082
Make a photocopy.

575
00:46:51,916 --> 00:46:52,957
"The Visit"?

576
00:46:53,125 --> 00:46:54,040
Yes.

577
00:46:54,208 --> 00:46:56,415
Ignacio and I are starting
on the script.

578
00:46:56,583 --> 00:47:00,040
If you’re going to direct it,
it's best if you write it yourself.

579
00:47:00,208 --> 00:47:01,249
All right, Ignacio.

580
00:47:02,666 --> 00:47:04,999
Angel!
Start calling me Angel,

581
00:47:05,166 --> 00:47:07,249
or you’ll never get used to it.

582
00:47:20,833 --> 00:47:22,374
Do you mind driving?

583
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,207
I'm a bit shaky.

584
00:47:24,708 --> 00:47:27,790
I'm surprised you can even walk
with all you've taken.

585
00:47:28,083 --> 00:47:29,624
We had to celebrate, right?

586
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:31,707
I thought we’d be talking
about the project.

587
00:47:32,208 --> 00:47:33,374
We'll talk later.

588
00:47:33,958 --> 00:47:35,124
We've got time

589
00:47:49,833 --> 00:47:50,957
Remember?

590
00:47:53,916 --> 00:47:54,999
Remember what?

591
00:47:57,833 --> 00:47:58,874
Nothing.

592
00:48:02,333 --> 00:48:03,999
You're really high.

593
00:48:05,625 --> 00:48:07,249
What should I remember?

594
00:48:07,958 --> 00:48:08,999
Nothing.

595
00:48:12,541 --> 00:48:13,790
Turn off here

596
00:48:35,916 --> 00:48:37,082
Is all this yours?

597
00:48:37,541 --> 00:48:39,874
No, noway.
I’ve just rented it.

598
00:48:40,875 --> 00:48:43,957
Don't be too impressed,
it's a mess inside.

599
00:48:49,916 --> 00:48:50,957
How about a swim?

600
00:48:51,541 --> 00:48:53,165
It would do you good.

601
00:49:41,458 --> 00:49:42,874
How's the water?

602
00:49:43,375 --> 00:49:44,790
It's waiting for you

603
00:50:24,791 --> 00:50:25,874
"THE PEARL"

604
00:51:14,666 --> 00:51:15,957
Will you pass me a cigarette?

605
00:51:26,291 --> 00:51:29,457
You weren't serious about
playing Zahara, were you?

606
00:51:30,333 --> 00:51:31,582
Totally.

607
00:51:32,250 --> 00:51:34,499
I don’t joke about work either.

608
00:51:34,958 --> 00:51:36,749
Then let's not talk about work.

609
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,124
What are you doing?

610
00:51:39,291 --> 00:51:41,457
Sleeping here
or going back to Madrid?

611
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:43,874
If you want, I'll stay.

612
00:51:44,916 --> 00:51:46,999
But, talking about bodies,

613
00:51:47,875 --> 00:51:50,999
if I look too manly
I can slim down.

614
00:51:51,166 --> 00:51:53,332
I'm very flexible,
I can do anything.

615
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,499
You disconcert me, Angel.

616
00:51:57,250 --> 00:51:58,707
You told me that already.

617
00:51:59,875 --> 00:52:02,165
And you told me
about slimming down.

618
00:52:02,583 --> 00:52:04,957
Why don't we just talk clearly?

619
00:52:06,291 --> 00:52:08,165
I can't say it
any more clearly!

620
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:09,540
I'm an actor.

621
00:52:09,833 --> 00:52:13,540
I spent three fucking years
doing shit with Bumblebee.

622
00:52:13,708 --> 00:52:16,499
This is my first chance
to get a terrific part

623
00:52:16,666 --> 00:52:18,374
and I won't let it slip away.

624
00:52:19,041 --> 00:52:20,124
You can't do Zahara.

625
00:52:20,666 --> 00:52:23,290
Not at first sight,
but give me time!

626
00:52:24,250 --> 00:52:25,499
You're a good director,

627
00:52:25,666 --> 00:52:27,540
and I'll do anything!

628
00:52:27,708 --> 00:52:30,040
You just have
to trust both of us

629
00:52:31,916 --> 00:52:33,165
I've tried.

630
00:52:34,625 --> 00:52:35,957
But I can't trust you.

631
00:52:37,166 --> 00:52:38,082
Why?

632
00:52:41,166 --> 00:52:44,082
I just can't recognize
the Ignacio I knew at school.

633
00:52:45,666 --> 00:52:48,832
The one who loved"Cuore Matto",
and so many other things

634
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:50,874
My tastes have changed.

635
00:52:52,541 --> 00:52:54,040
Is that what bothers you?

636
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,624
People change with time.

637
00:52:59,625 --> 00:53:00,624
Not you

638
00:53:01,541 --> 00:53:03,165
Simply,you're not Ignacio.

639
00:53:04,291 --> 00:53:07,624
Who the fuck are you to decide
who I am or who I'm not?

640
00:53:08,291 --> 00:53:09,707
How dare you?

641
00:53:11,125 --> 00:53:13,082
Why am I not Ignacio?

642
00:53:13,541 --> 00:53:16,165
Because I don't remember
a song from years ago?

643
00:53:16,791 --> 00:53:19,915
-Apart from that.
-Because I'm not sucking your dick?

644
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,457
If I’d stayed like the kid you knew,
I'd be dead now.

645
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,540
I already am

646
00:53:28,291 --> 00:53:29,707
Dead tired.

647
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:32,582
I'm going to bed.

648
00:53:33,166 --> 00:53:34,165
What are you doing?

649
00:53:35,958 --> 00:53:37,040
I don't know.

650
00:53:38,166 --> 00:53:39,207
You tell me.

651
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,332
Tell you what?

652
00:53:43,041 --> 00:53:45,332
If I’m going to play Zahara.

653
00:53:46,541 --> 00:53:48,499
Does your staying
depend on that?

654
00:53:49,291 --> 00:53:50,082
No.

655
00:53:51,083 --> 00:53:53,874
But if I don't play Zahara
there's no film

656
00:53:55,250 --> 00:53:58,124
Then I don't know
why you’re here, cock teaser

657
00:53:59,125 --> 00:54:00,207
Get out!

658
00:54:06,250 --> 00:54:09,707
Why the hell did I decide
to see you again, fucking faggot!

659
00:54:36,166 --> 00:54:39,040
"A woman threw herself
into a pool of hungry crocodiles

660
00:54:39,208 --> 00:54:42,374
in a zoo that was crowded
with visitors at the time.

661
00:54:43,375 --> 00:54:46,457
When the first crocodile attacked,
the woman hugged it,

662
00:54:46,625 --> 00:54:47,832
according to witnesses.

663
00:54:48,166 --> 00:54:50,999
The crocodiles devoured
the body of the woman,

664
00:54:51,666 --> 00:54:52,915
who never complained,

665
00:54:53,250 --> 00:54:54,665
in a few minutes."

666
00:54:55,416 --> 00:54:56,915
What a horrible death!

667
00:54:57,833 --> 00:54:59,124
Well...

668
00:55:00,041 --> 00:55:02,165
She didn't even open her mouth.

669
00:55:07,833 --> 00:55:08,749
What's on your mind?

670
00:55:12,416 --> 00:55:14,040
Hungry crocodiles

671
00:56:29,250 --> 00:56:30,499
Hello, come in.

672
00:56:31,250 --> 00:56:32,665
It's the journalist

673
00:56:34,125 --> 00:56:35,165
Why are you here?

674
00:56:35,708 --> 00:56:37,082
To interview me?

675
00:56:37,541 --> 00:56:39,415
No.
Well, yes.

676
00:56:39,875 --> 00:56:41,124
Which is it, cutie?

677
00:56:41,291 --> 00:56:43,915
I'm not a journalist,
I'm an actor.

678
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,374
And I'd like you to help me
prepare a character.

679
00:56:49,458 --> 00:56:50,999
What character?

680
00:56:51,958 --> 00:56:55,165
A tranny who imitates
Sara Montiel, among others.

681
00:56:55,458 --> 00:56:58,249
That's me!
Why don’t they give me the part?

682
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:01,999
Well,you're not an actor,
you’re just a faggot.

683
00:57:03,833 --> 00:57:06,540
What you have to learn
is how to be polite,

684
00:57:06,708 --> 00:57:09,249
because that's no way
to treat a lady!

685
00:57:09,916 --> 00:57:11,082
I'm sorry.

686
00:57:11,291 --> 00:57:12,540
So will you teach me?

687
00:57:14,750 --> 00:57:16,957
And how will you pay me,
honey?

688
00:57:17,333 --> 00:57:20,207
That's what I'm looking for!

689
00:57:21,291 --> 00:57:22,332
Two minutes!

690
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:23,582
We'll talk later.

691
00:57:24,208 --> 00:57:25,582
I'm on now.

692
00:57:26,250 --> 00:57:28,082
Everything you do
is great for me.

693
00:57:28,708 --> 00:57:29,749
I'm delighted.

694
00:57:30,833 --> 00:57:31,999
See you later.

695
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,207
"THE PEARL"

696
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:53,082
Ortigueira, 6 miles.

697
00:58:02,791 --> 00:58:05,082
"THE PEARL HOSTEL"

698
00:58:22,458 --> 00:58:24,582
-What can I get you?
-A beer.

699
00:58:30,625 --> 00:58:33,915
Forgive me for asking,
but how did you get that lighter?

700
00:58:34,083 --> 00:58:36,832
-You're not from here.
-I stole it from a friend.

701
00:58:37,291 --> 00:58:39,124
His family lives here.

702
00:58:39,375 --> 00:58:42,165
Maybe you know him.
His name is Angel Andrade.

703
00:58:42,333 --> 00:58:42,957
Yes.

704
00:58:43,125 --> 00:58:45,832
-That's his stage name.
-Sure I know him.

705
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,915
-You do?
-Yes, very well

706
00:58:48,166 --> 00:58:49,290
That's great.

707
00:59:18,375 --> 00:59:19,540
Who is it?

708
00:59:20,625 --> 00:59:23,915
Enrique.
I was at school with Ignacio.

709
00:59:24,791 --> 00:59:26,832
Go away
or I'll call the police!

710
00:59:37,208 --> 00:59:38,249
Excuse me.

711
00:59:39,250 --> 00:59:40,540
Are you Enrique Goded?

712
00:59:41,208 --> 00:59:42,082
Yes.

713
00:59:45,375 --> 00:59:47,207
I'm Ignacio's mother.

714
00:59:47,458 --> 00:59:49,082
I'm delighted to meet you.

715
00:59:49,250 --> 00:59:50,999
-Come in.
-Thank you

716
00:59:51,958 --> 00:59:53,374
Forgive my sister-in-law.

717
00:59:54,125 --> 00:59:57,874
I've got the heart problem,
but she’s the one gets scared.

718
00:59:58,041 --> 00:59:59,374
It doesn't matter.

719
01:00:00,375 --> 01:00:02,165
Ignacio talked a lot about you

720
01:00:03,041 --> 01:00:05,374
-We were very good friends.
-I know.

721
01:00:06,250 --> 01:00:09,457
The last time he came to see me
he wrote you a letter.

722
01:00:09,791 --> 01:00:10,999
A letter?

723
01:00:11,250 --> 01:00:12,582
I never got it.

724
01:00:12,750 --> 01:00:15,665
It was three years ago.

725
01:00:16,208 --> 01:00:19,707
He didn't know your address,
he sent it to the Ministry of Culture

726
01:00:20,916 --> 01:00:22,457
Then I'm not surprised.

727
01:00:22,916 --> 01:00:25,540
By the time it was returned,
he was dead.

728
01:00:26,833 --> 01:00:28,165
Let's go into the dining room.

729
01:00:34,791 --> 01:00:36,082
That's my son Juan.

730
01:00:36,750 --> 01:00:37,915
The younger boy.

731
01:00:38,083 --> 01:00:39,249
He's in the theater.

732
01:00:39,416 --> 01:00:41,124
He's changed his name.

733
01:00:41,541 --> 01:00:43,415
He says
there are too many Juans.

734
01:00:43,791 --> 01:00:46,249
He wants even me
to call him Angel.

735
01:00:52,208 --> 01:00:54,415
I'd like to see Ignacio's room.

736
01:00:55,541 --> 01:00:58,790
To be honest,
he didn't really have a room.

737
01:00:59,375 --> 01:01:02,457
But when he came,
he liked to use the attic.

738
01:01:02,708 --> 01:01:04,624
Would you like to see it?

739
01:01:09,208 --> 01:01:10,832
We're going upstairs!

740
01:01:27,041 --> 01:01:28,665
Juan burned everything.

741
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,457
The notebooks, the clothes...

742
01:01:31,833 --> 01:01:33,457
All except those magazines.

743
01:01:36,791 --> 01:01:38,957
There's nothing left
of what Ignacio wrote?

744
01:01:42,250 --> 01:01:42,957
What a pity!

745
01:01:44,083 --> 01:01:46,332
Are you from a publisher too?

746
01:01:48,208 --> 01:01:49,624
What publisher?

747
01:01:50,750 --> 01:01:52,749
Soon after Ignacio died,

748
01:01:53,125 --> 01:01:56,957
a man came who was in charge
of publishing young authors,

749
01:01:57,291 --> 01:01:58,957
or so he said.

750
01:01:59,125 --> 01:02:02,957
He was desperate to get
his hands on Ignacio's stories.

751
01:02:03,750 --> 01:02:06,415
Do you remember his name,
or the publisher's?

752
01:02:07,041 --> 01:02:08,832
No, but he was very insistent.

753
01:02:09,291 --> 01:02:12,249
So I told the truth,
that Juan had burned everything,

754
01:02:12,416 --> 01:02:14,790
and he even asked
for Juan’s address.

755
01:02:14,958 --> 01:02:16,707
I gave him a false one,
of course

756
01:02:18,166 --> 01:02:20,165
I think that man
was half mad

757
01:02:39,916 --> 01:02:41,582
This is Ignacio's letter.

758
01:02:44,625 --> 01:02:45,915
It didn't get burned

759
01:02:46,083 --> 01:02:48,749
because I never told Juan
it had been returned.

760
01:02:50,916 --> 01:02:52,290
Thank you, ma'am.

761
01:02:53,458 --> 01:02:55,707
Don’t judge my Juan

762
01:02:56,625 --> 01:02:57,874
He's a good son,

763
01:02:59,250 --> 01:03:01,832
but his brother's death
really hit him.

764
01:03:02,583 --> 01:03:04,624
He was the one who found him.

765
01:03:17,041 --> 01:03:18,082
Dear Enrique,

766
01:03:18,708 --> 01:03:20,540
At last I've got news of you

767
01:03:20,875 --> 01:03:22,665
I read it in the papers.

768
01:03:22,833 --> 01:03:25,124
You've directed
your first film, man.

769
01:03:25,458 --> 01:03:28,749
Even if it was underground.
And to think I was the film buff!

770
01:03:30,291 --> 01:03:32,915
You'll be pleased to hear
I'm still writing.

771
01:03:33,083 --> 01:03:35,999
I'm enclosing a story
that would make a divine film

772
01:03:36,291 --> 01:03:38,249
Fr. Manolo inspired it.

773
01:03:38,666 --> 01:03:41,999
It's incredible, but I ran into him
the other day in Valencia

774
01:03:42,166 --> 01:03:45,207
I'm visiting my mother now,
but I live in Valencia

775
01:03:45,958 --> 01:03:48,457
I've checked up,
he isn't a priest anymore.

776
01:03:48,666 --> 01:03:51,749
He calls himself
by his last name, Berenguer.

777
01:03:52,125 --> 01:03:55,582
He works in a publisher's,
he's married and has a son.

778
01:03:56,375 --> 01:03:58,415
I thought: He's crying out
to be blackmailed!

779
01:03:59,208 --> 01:04:01,915
So I wrote"The Visit",
the story I'm sending you.

780
01:04:02,791 --> 01:04:04,249
Read it, please.

781
01:04:05,291 --> 01:04:08,540
At this point in my life,
I need a lot of money

782
01:04:08,708 --> 01:04:11,040
and I'm going to get it
from that fucker!

783
01:04:11,625 --> 01:04:13,790
He owes me a lot,

784
01:04:14,166 --> 01:04:15,874
and it's time for him to pay.

785
01:04:17,958 --> 01:04:20,790
Write to me and I'll tell you
the rest of the story.

786
01:04:21,750 --> 01:04:24,165
All I'm asking
is to hear from you.

787
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:26,874
I can only share this story
with you.

788
01:04:28,083 --> 01:04:29,415
I love you.

789
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,374
Your Ignacio.

790
01:04:46,166 --> 01:04:47,249
I'll get it.

791
01:04:58,291 --> 01:04:59,457
What do you want?

792
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,624
I've come to apologize.

793
01:05:09,625 --> 01:05:12,790
I'll give you your shorts
You left them behind.

794
01:05:13,416 --> 01:05:14,499
Thank you

795
01:05:16,250 --> 01:05:18,290
I'm very sorry
about what I said.

796
01:05:19,125 --> 01:05:20,374
I take it all back.

797
01:05:21,291 --> 01:05:23,624
If you’re still interested,
"The Visit"is yours.

798
01:05:23,791 --> 01:05:26,082
Do it with whoever
and however you want.

799
01:05:29,166 --> 01:05:30,624
Have you lost weight?

800
01:05:31,083 --> 01:05:33,624
Yes.
I'm really working at it.

801
01:05:34,125 --> 01:05:37,374
I want to lose even more.
And I'm taking classes.

802
01:05:38,125 --> 01:05:40,749
-Classes in what?
-In how to be a queen.

803
01:05:43,666 --> 01:05:46,249
I'm working with the best
Sara Montiel impersonator.

804
01:05:46,416 --> 01:05:48,499
She performs at"Bámbola",
a gay club

805
01:05:48,666 --> 01:05:50,165
I'm working as a waiter there

806
01:05:50,333 --> 01:05:52,790
so I can study the queens
more closely.

807
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,207
Then you're still
thinking about Zahara.

808
01:05:56,458 --> 01:05:57,457
Yes.

809
01:05:57,750 --> 01:05:59,790
Just let me do an audition.

810
01:06:00,458 --> 01:06:01,540
Thank you

811
01:06:04,375 --> 01:06:07,707
-You had it!
-Yes, you left that behind too.

812
01:06:09,541 --> 01:06:10,832
Ignacio,
I'd like to talk...

813
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:14,665
Until you call me Angel, I won't
believe you're taking me seriously.

814
01:06:15,958 --> 01:06:18,665
Angel,
I'm sure you’re a good actor,

815
01:06:20,166 --> 01:06:21,707
now more than ever.

816
01:06:22,208 --> 01:06:23,790
So you'll let me audition?

817
01:06:34,958 --> 01:06:37,415
The audition worked
for several months,

818
01:06:38,041 --> 01:06:41,665
long enough for me to throw myself
into the shooting of"The Visit",

819
01:06:41,875 --> 01:06:44,499
like the woman who
threw herself to the crocodiles

820
01:06:44,666 --> 01:06:47,415
and hugged them
as they ate her.

821
01:07:04,958 --> 01:07:06,540
You've changed the ending.

822
01:07:07,416 --> 01:07:08,457
Yes.

823
01:07:09,541 --> 01:07:12,665
"The Visit"can't end happily,
like your story.

824
01:07:12,833 --> 01:07:14,040
Why?

825
01:07:14,958 --> 01:07:17,290
Zahara can’t just
walkout of the school.

826
01:07:17,750 --> 01:07:19,957
She's a danger to the priests.

827
01:07:20,125 --> 01:07:22,374
And we know
what the Church is capable of.

828
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,124
But this ending
is really heavy, man.

829
01:07:26,125 --> 01:07:29,082
For you, as an actor,
it's much more interesting.

830
01:07:29,250 --> 01:07:30,874
-You think so?
-Of course

831
01:07:32,625 --> 01:07:35,249
I shot"The Visit"
as a homage to Ignacio.

832
01:07:35,541 --> 01:07:38,749
In his letter, he'd said
he'd love to see it on the screen.

833
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,207
And also to discover
the enigma of Juan

834
01:07:42,375 --> 01:07:44,957
He allowed me
to penetrate him frequently,

835
01:07:45,166 --> 01:07:46,790
but only physically.

836
01:07:47,833 --> 01:07:51,665
We were about to finish shooting
and his mystery was still intact.

837
01:07:52,333 --> 01:07:53,624
But on the last day

838
01:07:54,166 --> 01:07:55,707
we had a visit.

839
01:07:56,583 --> 01:07:57,790
Silence!

840
01:07:58,500 --> 01:08:00,457
And... roll camera!

841
01:08:01,125 --> 01:08:01,999
Rolling!

842
01:08:02,583 --> 01:08:04,957
"The Visit",
91, 1, first take

843
01:08:06,041 --> 01:08:07,332
Zahara, darling!

844
01:08:07,708 --> 01:08:08,790
Action!

845
01:08:12,166 --> 01:08:14,874
The boys are in class
and I'm sick of arguing.

846
01:08:15,250 --> 01:08:16,415
Let me out!

847
01:08:18,208 --> 01:08:19,332
Do you want to kidnap me?

848
01:08:21,041 --> 01:08:22,249
Open the door!

849
01:08:22,708 --> 01:08:25,874
I have to take a piss,
buy cigarettes, get a fix!

850
01:08:26,041 --> 01:08:27,707
Even if I got the money,

851
01:08:28,125 --> 01:08:31,332
how can I be sure
you won't blackmail me again?

852
01:08:31,625 --> 01:08:32,832
You'll never be sure.

853
01:08:33,125 --> 01:08:34,957
That's my revenge.

854
01:08:43,375 --> 01:08:44,749
Let me out or I'll scream.

855
01:08:45,625 --> 01:08:46,915
I loved Ignacio.

856
01:08:48,208 --> 01:08:51,999
You don't love a boy often
You harass him, you abuse him!

857
01:08:52,916 --> 01:08:54,124
I loved him.

858
01:08:58,708 --> 01:08:59,832
Please, let me out!

859
01:09:00,333 --> 01:09:01,374
I'm locked in!

860
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,624
She's threatening
to denounce us.

861
01:09:29,791 --> 01:09:31,707
She wants a million pesetas
to keep quiet.

862
01:09:31,875 --> 01:09:35,040
If you give her a single peseta,
you'll never stop paying.

863
01:09:38,791 --> 01:09:41,374
I knew we’d meet again,
scum!

864
01:09:43,041 --> 01:09:44,290
You know her?

865
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,415
You knew him
much better than I did.

866
01:09:47,583 --> 01:09:48,874
It's Ignacio Rodríguez.

867
01:09:51,250 --> 01:09:52,415
Ignacio!

868
01:09:55,541 --> 01:09:56,790
It can't be!

869
01:09:58,375 --> 01:09:59,540
We have to finish him off.

870
01:10:00,166 --> 01:10:02,415
He's a danger
to the whole congregation!

871
01:10:05,333 --> 01:10:06,707
He wants to say something.

872
01:10:07,333 --> 01:10:08,624
Yes, that we let him go.

873
01:10:20,833 --> 01:10:22,332
If you’re going to kill me,

874
01:10:23,875 --> 01:10:25,332
I'd like to confess first.

875
01:10:26,333 --> 01:10:27,832
Confess what?

876
01:10:28,583 --> 01:10:31,082
Thanks to you
we've got noway out.

877
01:10:42,625 --> 01:10:44,165
You have to stay calm

878
01:10:45,083 --> 01:10:47,165
I'll get rid of the body.

879
01:10:47,333 --> 01:10:48,332
How?

880
01:10:48,625 --> 01:10:50,915
It's best if you know nothing.

881
01:10:51,250 --> 01:10:53,124
It was self-defense.

882
01:10:53,541 --> 01:10:55,665
He'd have made
our lives impossible.

883
01:10:55,833 --> 01:10:56,582
Yes,

884
01:10:57,625 --> 01:10:58,999
I guess so.

885
01:11:00,250 --> 01:11:02,332
And there are no witnesses.

886
01:11:03,875 --> 01:11:04,957
God.

887
01:11:05,333 --> 01:11:06,290
Yes,

888
01:11:06,625 --> 01:11:08,040
but He's on our side.

889
01:11:17,541 --> 01:11:18,582
Cut!

890
01:11:19,250 --> 01:11:20,999
We've cut, guys!

891
01:11:24,791 --> 01:11:27,374
This one's good.
What about the other one?

892
01:11:29,250 --> 01:11:30,582
Give me No. 1 as well.

893
01:11:31,416 --> 01:11:32,624
Well done, guys.

894
01:11:33,208 --> 01:11:35,374
No, it was great.

895
01:11:41,083 --> 01:11:42,457
Is anything wrong?

896
01:11:47,708 --> 01:11:49,207
I'll see you later.

897
01:11:58,625 --> 01:12:00,165
It went really well

898
01:12:47,375 --> 01:12:49,332
Put that down!
Who are you?

899
01:12:49,833 --> 01:12:51,207
The villain in your film

900
01:12:52,333 --> 01:12:53,457
Fr. Manolo!

901
01:12:53,708 --> 01:12:54,957
Mr. Berenguer.

902
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:01,040
I'm not even a father
to my own son now.

903
01:13:06,291 --> 01:13:07,415
Get out!

904
01:13:08,291 --> 01:13:10,749
I read in a magazine
that you were here.

905
01:13:15,375 --> 01:13:18,457
Go and drink some hot milk
with honey, and an aspirin,

906
01:13:18,625 --> 01:13:19,707
and leave me alone.

907
01:13:20,583 --> 01:13:23,624
I've got a lotto do,
I can't waste time on you.

908
01:13:25,125 --> 01:13:27,374
Not even to find out
how Ignacio died?

909
01:13:31,208 --> 01:13:32,499
Or who killed him?

910
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,582
And if it coincides
with your film?

911
01:13:39,833 --> 01:13:41,582
Say what you have to say
and go.

912
01:13:46,083 --> 01:13:47,707
I was living in Valencia

913
01:13:49,083 --> 01:13:52,165
I worked for a publisher
that promoted young writers.

914
01:13:54,208 --> 01:13:57,415
Three years ago, I received
a story called "The Visit",

915
01:13:58,375 --> 01:14:00,165
signed by Ignacio Rodríguez.

916
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:03,790
Ignacio Rodríguez is calling
about the new writers anthology.

917
01:14:03,958 --> 01:14:05,874
Didn’t you tell him
he was rejected?

918
01:14:06,041 --> 01:14:08,582
Yes, but he insists
on speaking to you.

919
01:14:08,750 --> 01:14:09,999
He's on your line.

920
01:14:15,958 --> 01:14:17,915
-Mr.José Manuel Berenguer?
-Yes.

921
01:14:18,083 --> 01:14:20,499
-I preferred Fr. Manolo.
-Excuse me?

922
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,707
-Are you the author of"The Visit"?
-Yes.

923
01:14:24,583 --> 01:14:27,749
We decided not to include it
in"Short Stories of the 80s"

924
01:14:28,083 --> 01:14:30,707
-I'm sorry.
-You and I have to talk.

925
01:14:31,458 --> 01:14:33,999
I think not.
I've got nothing more to say.

926
01:14:34,666 --> 01:14:35,832
But I do.

927
01:14:36,791 --> 01:14:38,749
I went to St.John's School.

928
01:14:39,458 --> 01:14:41,582
You were my literature teacher,

929
01:14:42,125 --> 01:14:44,499
and you were
madly in love with me.

930
01:14:45,291 --> 01:14:47,457
I remember how
you'd embrace me from behind

931
01:14:47,625 --> 01:14:49,457
while you declared your love.

932
01:14:50,583 --> 01:14:52,624
I can't believe you've forgotten.

933
01:14:54,333 --> 01:14:56,624
I remember the buttons
on your soutane

934
01:14:56,791 --> 01:14:58,790
digging into my backbone.

935
01:14:59,958 --> 01:15:01,540
Have you really forgotten?

936
01:15:03,041 --> 01:15:04,957
I'll expect you
at my house at 7:00.

937
01:15:05,125 --> 01:15:07,915
My address is on the back
of the envelope, Fr. Manolo.

938
01:15:26,541 --> 01:15:27,832
Push the door.

939
01:15:28,125 --> 01:15:29,499
It’s just stuck.

940
01:15:46,791 --> 01:15:49,124
That wasn’t the Ignacio
you and I loved.

941
01:15:49,708 --> 01:15:51,082
Hello, Mr. Berenguer.

942
01:15:51,875 --> 01:15:52,874
I'm Ignacio.

943
01:15:54,166 --> 01:15:55,457
Please, come in.

944
01:16:05,291 --> 01:16:06,832
Yes, I'm a junkie,

945
01:16:07,458 --> 01:16:10,290
but I want to quit
and I thought you could help me.

946
01:16:11,541 --> 01:16:13,624
Well, I know a clinic.

947
01:16:13,916 --> 01:16:16,957
So do I, but first I want
to fix myself up a bit.

948
01:16:17,166 --> 01:16:20,624
I know I've got divine tits,
but everything else...

949
01:16:21,416 --> 01:16:22,915
Anyway, I won't get into that.

950
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:26,415
Looking pretty
costs a lot of money, Fr. Manolo.

951
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:29,082
I think a million would do it.

952
01:16:30,541 --> 01:16:31,624
A million?

953
01:16:32,083 --> 01:16:35,790
Yes, in cash, and my lips
are sealed. I won't say a word.

954
01:16:36,083 --> 01:16:37,582
You're out of your mind!

955
01:16:38,166 --> 01:16:41,124
Sexual harassment
is frowned upon, Fr. Manolo.

956
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:43,999
What would your wife think,
or your boss?

957
01:16:44,750 --> 01:16:47,207
You're in no position
to blackmail anyone.

958
01:16:47,625 --> 01:16:49,957
I could have you
arrested tonight.

959
01:16:50,958 --> 01:16:51,999
Very well

960
01:16:52,375 --> 01:16:55,915
You call the police,
I'll call your wife and the media.

961
01:16:56,833 --> 01:16:59,999
A blackmailer can't be
as defenseless as you are.

962
01:17:00,166 --> 01:17:02,040
Believe me,
I know what I'm saying.

963
01:17:06,416 --> 01:17:08,082
Juan, go back to your room.

964
01:17:08,250 --> 01:17:09,457
I want to watch TV

965
01:17:10,083 --> 01:17:12,540
Watch it later,
we’re talking business.

966
01:17:13,791 --> 01:17:15,165
I don't mind if he stays.

967
01:17:15,375 --> 01:17:16,874
I'm sure you don't.

968
01:17:17,208 --> 01:17:19,249
He's my brother,
he's looking after me.

969
01:17:19,416 --> 01:17:21,124
Or that’s my mother's idea.

970
01:17:21,375 --> 01:17:22,790
I'm Mr. Berenguer.

971
01:17:26,041 --> 01:17:27,790
One million, end of story

972
01:17:30,083 --> 01:17:32,165
Do you want me
to call him Juan,

973
01:17:33,291 --> 01:17:34,457
or Angel?

974
01:17:37,708 --> 01:17:40,249
The blackmail
became an investment for me.

975
01:17:48,333 --> 01:17:52,249
I visited the brothers frequently
so I could keep seeing Juan.

976
01:17:57,166 --> 01:17:59,290
Remember Don Narciso,
the Nazi?

977
01:17:59,458 --> 01:18:02,124
He loved my illustrations.
Look at this one.

978
01:18:02,625 --> 01:18:05,915
And there's another one..
Look,this is beautiful.

979
01:18:06,833 --> 01:18:07,999
And this one...

980
01:18:09,083 --> 01:18:10,915
-"Children of Spain".
-I brought you this.

981
01:18:11,833 --> 01:18:15,332
I kept Ignacio happy
with small amounts of money

982
01:18:16,875 --> 01:18:18,165
And I kept stalling him.

983
01:18:34,791 --> 01:18:36,665
I desired Juan,

984
01:18:37,583 --> 01:18:38,832
more and more everyday.

985
01:18:45,625 --> 01:18:46,332
Hello.

986
01:18:46,500 --> 01:18:48,374
You brought the dough?

987
01:18:48,875 --> 01:18:50,457
I can only give you 50,000.

988
01:18:51,291 --> 01:18:53,207
You said
you'd bring the million!

989
01:18:53,875 --> 01:18:56,749
I said they'd tell me today
if I’d get the loan.

990
01:18:57,333 --> 01:18:58,582
They said yes,

991
01:18:58,750 --> 01:19:00,999
but they have
to check my guarantees

992
01:19:02,708 --> 01:19:04,624
I need another three weeks.

993
01:19:05,083 --> 01:19:06,499
Another three weeks!

994
01:19:06,708 --> 01:19:08,915
I'm a junkie
Haven’t you noticed?

995
01:19:09,083 --> 01:19:11,040
I could be dead in three weeks.

996
01:19:12,333 --> 01:19:14,582
-Are you going away?
-Obviously!

997
01:19:15,666 --> 01:19:17,915
I want to see my mother
before I check in.

998
01:19:18,083 --> 01:19:21,499
She has to see me with these teeth
and this face, and it's your fault!

999
01:19:21,666 --> 01:19:24,999
Don't be unfair, Ignacio,
I'm doing what I can.

1000
01:19:25,541 --> 01:19:26,832
Then do more!

1001
01:19:27,875 --> 01:19:29,582
I'll be gone for a week.

1002
01:19:29,791 --> 01:19:31,707
When I come back
I want that million.

1003
01:19:31,875 --> 01:19:35,249
If you don't have it,you'll be sorry.
I'm sick of being put off!

1004
01:19:36,041 --> 01:19:38,124
I'll try to hurry them up, but...

1005
01:19:53,291 --> 01:19:54,290
Father!

1006
01:19:57,791 --> 01:19:58,749
Come along.

1007
01:20:00,291 --> 01:20:01,499
Shall I help you?

1008
01:20:02,166 --> 01:20:04,582
Sure, take the Olivetti,
it's the heaviest.

1009
01:20:14,041 --> 01:20:16,124
While you're at it,
take this too.

1010
01:20:38,958 --> 01:20:40,415
Stop that taxi

1011
01:20:47,250 --> 01:20:48,832
-Bye, Father.
-Goodbye.

1012
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:50,499
Open the trunk please.

1013
01:21:04,291 --> 01:21:05,624
My scarf!

1014
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:22,332
Excuse me.

1015
01:21:22,500 --> 01:21:25,499
I've come for my scarf.
I must have left it here.

1016
01:21:39,416 --> 01:21:41,582
-Fuck, it's really soft!
-Silk.

1017
01:21:42,833 --> 01:21:43,832
It's yours.

1018
01:21:45,125 --> 01:21:47,124
To be honest,
I left it here for you

1019
01:21:48,666 --> 01:21:50,707
Cut it out,
I'm not Ignacio!

1020
01:21:51,375 --> 01:21:52,582
Fortunately.

1021
01:21:55,291 --> 01:21:56,374
What time is it?

1022
01:21:57,666 --> 01:21:58,915
12:30.

1023
01:22:01,208 --> 01:22:02,874
Did he give you anything
for me?

1024
01:22:03,125 --> 01:22:04,165
Ignacio? No.

1025
01:22:04,791 --> 01:22:05,749
Fuck!

1026
01:22:06,333 --> 01:22:08,290
I had to pay
my school fees today.

1027
01:22:08,458 --> 01:22:09,499
Are you studying?

1028
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:11,832
Yes. Drama.

1029
01:22:12,458 --> 01:22:13,457
I'm an actor.

1030
01:22:14,416 --> 01:22:16,124
Selfish bastard!

1031
01:22:16,291 --> 01:22:19,374
He knew I had to pay today
and he didn't give me anything.

1032
01:22:20,250 --> 01:22:22,415
Obviously, I paid his fees.

1033
01:22:23,625 --> 01:22:25,374
I hadn't told Ignacio,

1034
01:22:26,333 --> 01:22:29,207
but the bank had granted me
a loan of two million.

1035
01:22:31,166 --> 01:22:33,082
I withdrew the first million.

1036
01:22:35,458 --> 01:22:38,082
I told my wife I was going
to a conference abroad.

1037
01:22:40,416 --> 01:22:41,624
She didn't believe me.

1038
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:48,999
I guess
that doesn't interest you

1039
01:22:54,375 --> 01:22:55,624
Not in the least.

1040
01:22:59,250 --> 01:23:00,540
How did Ignacio die?

1041
01:23:01,333 --> 01:23:03,457
The week Juan and I
spent alone

1042
01:23:04,250 --> 01:23:06,082
was the happiest in my life.

1043
01:23:06,250 --> 01:23:07,790
Everyday
I bought him something.

1044
01:23:08,375 --> 01:23:11,332
Clothes, a walkman,
a Super-8 camera.

1045
01:23:11,875 --> 01:23:14,290
I enjoyed the gifts
more than he did.

1046
01:23:15,375 --> 01:23:16,499
Take off your shirt.

1047
01:23:17,750 --> 01:23:19,207
Take it off.

1048
01:23:40,458 --> 01:23:41,749
Now it's my turn!

1049
01:23:50,083 --> 01:23:51,499
Now,take that off.

1050
01:23:51,708 --> 01:23:53,040
Show me your cock.

1051
01:23:53,875 --> 01:23:55,957
If you’re going to shoot my dick

1052
01:23:56,625 --> 01:23:58,124
don't show my face!

1053
01:23:58,791 --> 01:24:00,499
Too late.

1054
01:24:01,666 --> 01:24:02,749
I can't...!

1055
01:24:31,375 --> 01:24:32,832
You!
Give me some dough!

1056
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:34,540
I've got the fucking sweats.

1057
01:24:34,708 --> 01:24:37,415
-How's mom?
-She had another heart attack.

1058
01:24:37,791 --> 01:24:40,207
But she's all right now.
I'm the one who’s sick.

1059
01:24:48,916 --> 01:24:50,040
The dough!

1060
01:24:51,791 --> 01:24:53,624
-More!
-That's all I have.

1061
01:24:53,791 --> 01:24:57,207
I want that million now!
No more excuses!

1062
01:24:57,375 --> 01:24:59,665
No more stalling
and no more gifts.

1063
01:25:01,916 --> 01:25:02,707
Mom!

1064
01:25:02,875 --> 01:25:05,290
How are you,Juan?
Has Ignacio arrived?

1065
01:25:05,458 --> 01:25:06,290
Yes.

1066
01:25:06,625 --> 01:25:07,832
What happened this time?

1067
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:09,999
The usual thing, son, but...

1068
01:25:10,166 --> 01:25:13,665
He stole my pension,
and I’d just gotten it!

1069
01:25:13,833 --> 01:25:15,999
-Is that true?
-Yes, love, it is.

1070
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:19,874
Tell auntie
I'll send her some money.

1071
01:25:20,291 --> 01:25:23,165
He promised me
he was going into a clinic.

1072
01:25:24,708 --> 01:25:25,582
And you believed him?

1073
01:25:25,750 --> 01:25:29,415
Yes, this time he really means it.
He's going to try.

1074
01:25:30,208 --> 01:25:32,332
-You have to help him.
-How?

1075
01:25:32,916 --> 01:25:35,207
By being with him.
Don't leave him.

1076
01:25:35,583 --> 01:25:36,415
Promise me.

1077
01:25:37,375 --> 01:25:38,665
I promise.

1078
01:25:39,333 --> 01:25:40,999
Listen, did he give you

1079
01:25:41,166 --> 01:25:42,707
the cheese and the chorizos?

1080
01:25:42,916 --> 01:25:44,040
Delicious!

1081
01:25:44,208 --> 01:25:45,624
Why did you bother?

1082
01:25:45,791 --> 01:25:48,582
There's food in Valencia
Don't spend your money.

1083
01:25:48,750 --> 01:25:51,540
They're your favorites
I'd kept them for you

1084
01:25:51,791 --> 01:25:54,624
-You can't get them in Valencia
-All right,thanks.

1085
01:25:55,041 --> 01:25:58,457
-Lots of love, son.
-Yes, call me if anything happens.

1086
01:25:58,625 --> 01:26:00,082
Don’t worry, I will.

1087
01:26:00,250 --> 01:26:01,290
Bye.

1088
01:26:05,625 --> 01:26:07,082
Where's Ignacio?

1089
01:26:08,750 --> 01:26:09,915
I'm going to kill him!

1090
01:26:10,916 --> 01:26:12,624
It was Juan’s idea.

1091
01:26:13,291 --> 01:26:14,624
Or mine, I don't know.

1092
01:26:16,375 --> 01:26:18,624
The only solution
was to get rid of him

1093
01:26:20,125 --> 01:26:22,207
More or less
what you've just shot.

1094
01:26:23,041 --> 01:26:24,499
But not as violent.

1095
01:26:25,750 --> 01:26:27,165
How did you think of it?

1096
01:26:28,375 --> 01:26:30,374
Ignacio's story
doesn't end like that.

1097
01:26:33,291 --> 01:26:36,874
While I was adapting it,
I found out that Ignacio was dead.

1098
01:26:39,750 --> 01:26:40,999
Did Juan tell you?

1099
01:26:44,291 --> 01:26:45,874
I found out myself.

1100
01:26:46,958 --> 01:26:49,665
Will you just tell me
how it happened?

1101
01:26:50,333 --> 01:26:53,582
I arranged to meet Juan
at the Museum of Giant Figures.

1102
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:55,874
He had it all planned out.

1103
01:26:56,666 --> 01:26:58,957
Much more than
it seemed at first

1104
01:27:02,958 --> 01:27:05,332
I'll buy the junk
and you give it to him.

1105
01:27:06,125 --> 01:27:07,374
Why me?

1106
01:27:07,875 --> 01:27:09,665
Fuck he's my brother!

1107
01:27:10,291 --> 01:27:11,499
I'm not a monster.

1108
01:27:13,083 --> 01:27:14,999
Do you think
this doesn't hurt me?

1109
01:27:17,708 --> 01:27:19,832
But he's ruining all our lives.

1110
01:27:21,416 --> 01:27:22,790
What will we do afterwards?

1111
01:27:23,791 --> 01:27:25,665
We won't meet for a while.

1112
01:27:26,666 --> 01:27:27,749
Why?

1113
01:27:28,375 --> 01:27:30,415
You said
there'd be no investigation.

1114
01:27:30,583 --> 01:27:31,874
Just in case.

1115
01:27:32,041 --> 01:27:33,999
It's best
not to arouse suspicion.

1116
01:27:35,416 --> 01:27:38,165
I'll go and look after my mother,
she'll need it.

1117
01:27:38,625 --> 01:27:42,124
When things calm down,
I'll call you and we'll go away.

1118
01:27:42,916 --> 01:27:44,665
-Have you got the money?
-Yes.

1119
01:27:46,833 --> 01:27:48,790
What will I do
while I'm waiting?

1120
01:27:49,166 --> 01:27:52,290
Work earn money.
We'll need it.

1121
01:27:52,458 --> 01:27:54,707
The situation at home
is unbearable.

1122
01:27:55,208 --> 01:27:57,874
Apologize to your wife
and enjoy your son.

1123
01:27:59,041 --> 01:28:00,999
-Tell her the truth.
-What?

1124
01:28:01,166 --> 01:28:03,832
Say you’ve been
with someone else,

1125
01:28:04,416 --> 01:28:05,457
a woman.

1126
01:28:06,541 --> 01:28:08,499
Give me your mother's address.

1127
01:28:08,666 --> 01:28:11,124
It's best if I don't.

1128
01:28:11,791 --> 01:28:14,040
Then you won't be tempted
to come see me.

1129
01:28:16,333 --> 01:28:18,124
What are they laughing at?

1130
01:28:20,875 --> 01:28:22,332
They're laughing at us.

1131
01:28:26,083 --> 01:28:27,499
At me, at least.

1132
01:28:28,583 --> 01:28:30,749
Juan bought deadly pure heroin.

1133
01:28:31,458 --> 01:28:32,957
He gave it to me

1134
01:28:33,250 --> 01:28:34,999
and I went to Ignacio's.

1135
01:28:35,166 --> 01:28:36,207
Alone.

1136
01:28:44,708 --> 01:28:45,957
Dear Enrique:

1137
01:28:49,250 --> 01:28:52,165
I think I've succeeded...

1138
01:29:02,125 --> 01:29:03,874
This is my last fix

1139
01:29:04,666 --> 01:29:06,082
What do you mean?

1140
01:29:06,666 --> 01:29:07,790
I'm quitting.

1141
01:29:08,875 --> 01:29:10,332
This time I really am

1142
01:29:11,083 --> 01:29:13,665
Before I get my face
and all the rest done,

1143
01:29:13,875 --> 01:29:16,707
I'm checking
into a detox clinic.

1144
01:29:17,541 --> 01:29:19,207
I've already applied.

1145
01:29:19,708 --> 01:29:20,957
Good.

1146
01:29:21,500 --> 01:29:23,249
You'll have the money tomorrow

1147
01:29:23,708 --> 01:29:24,874
I hope so.

1148
01:29:25,583 --> 01:29:27,207
Before noon, OK?

1149
01:29:27,625 --> 01:29:29,207
Just in case,
I wrote two letters,

1150
01:29:29,375 --> 01:29:32,249
one for the publisher
and the other for your wife,

1151
01:29:32,541 --> 01:29:36,207
telling all you've hidden from them
in the past and present.

1152
01:29:38,416 --> 01:29:42,082
-That's unnecessary. Give them to me!
-When I get the money.

1153
01:29:42,250 --> 01:29:43,499
Before noon.

1154
01:29:57,375 --> 01:29:58,499
Pretty, aren’t they?

1155
01:29:59,375 --> 01:30:00,165
What?

1156
01:30:00,666 --> 01:30:01,874
My tits

1157
01:30:04,125 --> 01:30:05,790
Yes, they're wonderful.

1158
01:30:06,458 --> 01:30:07,624
Thank you

1159
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:16,999
Shall I help you?

1160
01:30:20,083 --> 01:30:21,124
Go away.

1161
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,249
I don't like fixing
in front of you

1162
01:31:26,833 --> 01:31:27,790
It's done.

1163
01:31:34,083 --> 01:31:35,332
Pull in here.

1164
01:31:35,750 --> 01:31:37,915
We'll go to the cinema
to kill time.

1165
01:31:38,166 --> 01:31:40,249
"FILM NOIRWEEK"

1166
01:31:58,750 --> 01:32:01,540
It's as if all the films
were talking about us.

1167
01:32:06,458 --> 01:32:07,332
Now what?

1168
01:32:08,958 --> 01:32:10,165
I'm going home.

1169
01:32:11,083 --> 01:32:14,665
-You want me to go with you?
-No, you'd better not.

1170
01:32:15,833 --> 01:32:18,707
Remember to get
those two letters.

1171
01:32:20,333 --> 01:32:22,332
If you don't
we'll be in trouble.

1172
01:32:22,500 --> 01:32:24,790
I'll get everything,
don’t worry

1173
01:32:32,541 --> 01:32:34,915
If we won't be seeing
each other for a while,

1174
01:32:37,291 --> 01:32:39,249
give me some of the Super-8s.

1175
01:32:41,458 --> 01:32:43,540
It would console me
to see us screwing.

1176
01:32:45,125 --> 01:32:46,290
You're nuts!

1177
01:32:46,458 --> 01:32:48,374
What if your wife saw them?

1178
01:32:49,458 --> 01:32:52,249
We have to burn them.
I'll take care of that

1179
01:32:54,250 --> 01:32:55,290
Let's go.

1180
01:33:05,208 --> 01:33:06,707
Get in for a minute.

1181
01:33:07,291 --> 01:33:09,499
No, I'm going to take a taxi.

1182
01:33:11,916 --> 01:33:12,999
Then,

1183
01:33:14,541 --> 01:33:15,915
I won't see you again...

1184
01:33:16,458 --> 01:33:17,999
It's just for a few days.

1185
01:33:30,458 --> 01:33:32,040
Call me as soon as you can.

1186
01:33:32,208 --> 01:33:33,040
Yes.

1187
01:34:43,416 --> 01:34:44,290
What's wrong?

1188
01:34:47,916 --> 01:34:48,957
You!

1189
01:34:49,375 --> 01:34:50,499
At last!

1190
01:34:50,833 --> 01:34:53,457
I read in this film magazine
that you were here.

1191
01:34:53,833 --> 01:34:54,957
What did you tell him?

1192
01:34:55,625 --> 01:34:56,665
Everything.

1193
01:34:58,125 --> 01:35:01,249
-Now you only have me, darling.
-You're crazy.

1194
01:35:01,833 --> 01:35:04,124
Remember I've got
my brother's letters,

1195
01:35:04,291 --> 01:35:06,124
accusing you of his death.

1196
01:35:06,291 --> 01:35:09,790
-We both did it, my love.
-The letters only mention you.

1197
01:35:11,541 --> 01:35:12,707
Wait!

1198
01:35:29,958 --> 01:35:32,374
-Are you all right?
-Leave me alone!

1199
01:35:33,791 --> 01:35:37,207
If I ever see you again,
I swear I'll kill you!

1200
01:35:37,916 --> 01:35:40,374
Now that I’ve found you,
I won't let you go.

1201
01:35:40,708 --> 01:35:42,415
Get used to the idea.

1202
01:35:48,250 --> 01:35:49,290
Mónica!

1203
01:35:50,125 --> 01:35:52,332
-Can you give me a lift?
-Sure.

1204
01:35:53,916 --> 01:35:55,290
Get in the front.

1205
01:35:57,666 --> 01:36:00,790
-Who was that?
-Someone looking for Enrique.

1206
01:36:25,291 --> 01:36:26,290
Who is it?

1207
01:36:26,833 --> 01:36:27,999
It's me.

1208
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:47,207
Give me back the keys.

1209
01:36:52,458 --> 01:36:55,290
Your things are in the hall.
Take them away.

1210
01:37:09,166 --> 01:37:10,624
The taxi's gone.

1211
01:37:11,375 --> 01:37:14,207
You'll have to lend me the car
or drive me back to Madrid.

1212
01:37:25,583 --> 01:37:26,957
I want to order a taxi.

1213
01:37:29,083 --> 01:37:31,415
11, Avenida del Agua.

1214
01:37:32,500 --> 01:37:34,124
Enrique Goded, yes.

1215
01:37:36,500 --> 01:37:37,707
Thank you

1216
01:37:40,750 --> 01:37:43,374
I was going to tell you
after the shoot.

1217
01:37:43,750 --> 01:37:44,999
Tell me what?

1218
01:37:46,083 --> 01:37:47,499
That my name is Juan.

1219
01:37:48,625 --> 01:37:51,832
That I'm Ignacio's brother
and Ignacio died four years ago.

1220
01:37:52,625 --> 01:37:53,874
I knew that already.

1221
01:37:54,583 --> 01:37:56,290
I know that you knew.

1222
01:37:56,916 --> 01:37:58,290
What do you mean?

1223
01:37:59,500 --> 01:38:02,915
My mother rang to tell me
you'd been to the house.

1224
01:38:03,125 --> 01:38:05,332
I guessed
you'd learned everything.

1225
01:38:05,791 --> 01:38:08,540
When you asked for the audition,
you knew that I knew?

1226
01:38:08,750 --> 01:38:09,665
Yes.

1227
01:38:10,083 --> 01:38:12,165
And you still kept pretending?

1228
01:38:12,333 --> 01:38:13,457
What else could I do?

1229
01:38:14,041 --> 01:38:15,999
I didn't lie,
you knew everything.

1230
01:38:16,166 --> 01:38:18,207
No, I didn't,far from it.

1231
01:38:18,375 --> 01:38:21,540
I knew you’d taken Ignacio's place
and that he was dead,

1232
01:38:21,708 --> 01:38:24,624
but I never imagined
that you’d killed him!

1233
01:38:24,916 --> 01:38:25,749
That's the taxi.

1234
01:38:25,916 --> 01:38:29,457
I didn't kill him, Berenguer did!
Ignacio was blackmailing him.

1235
01:38:29,625 --> 01:38:31,415
And you were hustling him!

1236
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:33,874
The taxi's waiting.

1237
01:38:36,166 --> 01:38:38,665
You don't know what it is
to have a brother like that

1238
01:38:38,833 --> 01:38:40,999
and live in a small town.

1239
01:38:42,125 --> 01:38:43,207
Juan,

1240
01:38:44,416 --> 01:38:46,124
the taxi is waiting.

1241
01:39:12,458 --> 01:39:14,082
Why did you choose me?

1242
01:39:15,416 --> 01:39:17,165
You still don't see me
as Zahara.

1243
01:39:18,291 --> 01:39:19,874
Was it just to fuck me?

1244
01:39:20,875 --> 01:39:22,082
It was curiosity.

1245
01:39:22,666 --> 01:39:25,165
I wanted to see
how far you would go

1246
01:39:26,083 --> 01:39:27,790
and how much I could take.

1247
01:39:29,375 --> 01:39:31,124
I would go a lot further.

1248
01:39:32,083 --> 01:39:32,999
I bet you would.

1249
01:39:38,958 --> 01:39:40,874
You needn't explain any more.

1250
01:39:41,041 --> 01:39:43,332
It's not mine.
It's from Ignacio.

1251
01:40:02,750 --> 01:40:07,999
Dear Enrique:
I think I've succeeded...

1252
01:40:16,083 --> 01:40:18,165
"After the release of "The Visit"

1253
01:40:18,375 --> 01:40:20,624
Angel Andrade
became the top heartthrob.

1254
01:40:20,791 --> 01:40:22,040
His reign
lasted for ten years.

1255
01:40:22,208 --> 01:40:24,290
In the'90s, his career
suffered ups and downs.

1256
01:40:24,458 --> 01:40:26,540
He married Mónica,
the wardrobe girl.

1257
01:40:26,708 --> 01:40:28,874
At present,
he works solely on TV series."

1258

"Mr. Berenguer
(formerly Fr. Manolo)

1259
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,040
didn’t vanish from the life
of Angel Andrade (Juan).

1260
01:40:34,208 --> 01:40:36,499
He started asking for money
and blackmailing him.

1261
01:40:36,666 --> 01:40:39,790
One night, he was run down
and killed by a car that didn't stop.

1262
01:40:39,958 --> 01:40:42,374
The car was driven
by Angel Andrade."

with the same passion."
