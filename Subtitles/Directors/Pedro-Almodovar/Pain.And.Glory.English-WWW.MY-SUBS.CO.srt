1
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,591
I wish I were a man,
to swim naked in the river.

2
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,909
How brave.

3
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,639
The things you say, Rosita.

4
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,953
Yeah, and have the water running
all over your thingy, how nice!

5
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,440
Yeah, that's right.

6
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,911
Before you jump in the water,
take the boy off me.

7
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,514
He's breaking my back.

8
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,160
- I'm sorry.
- Come, Salvador, come here.

9
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,872
Let's see.
Look, here's a stick for you to play.

10
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,434
- Okay.
- All right.

11
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,115
- Mari, help me with the sheets.
- Coming.

12
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,519
The little soapy fish.

13
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,034
Look! There they are.

14
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,440
The little soapy fish.

15
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,079
Sing a song for us, Rosita.

16
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,038
How beautiful.

17
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,680
<i>- By your side</i>
- Look how beautiful they are.

18
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,437
<i>By your side
Always by your little side</i>

19
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:39,274
<i>Always by your little side</i>

20
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,000
<i>Until from pain I die</i>

21
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:48,318
<i>I couldn't look into your eyes</i>

22
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,837
<i>I couldn't knock at your door</i>

23
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,792
Salvita, don't move from there, okay?

24
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,914
<i>I couldn't step at night</i>

25
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,075
<i>On the cobblestones of your alley</i>

26
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:07,393
<i>By your side
Always by your little side</i>

27
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,870
<i>Always by your little side</i>

28
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:14,477
<i>Until of love I die</i>

29
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,157
<i>Look, they say and say</i>

30
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:23,553
<i>Look at that afternoon</i>

31
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,235
<i>Look how it went and came</i>

32
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,197
<i>From his house to the poplar grove</i>

33
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:36,479
<i>And that way, looking and looking</i>

34
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,480
Come on, girl.

35
00:04:37,481 --> 00:04:39,153
<i>That's how my blindness</i>

36
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,910
<i>Started</i>

37
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,190
Salva.

38
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,474
It's Zulema.

39
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,835
What a surprise!

40
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,196
- Darling.
- I'm so happy to see you.

41
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,717
Can you have a coffee with me,
or are you in a hurry?

42
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,759
What will you do if you don't write or film?

43
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,791
- Live, I guess.
- I can't live without acting.

44
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,752
It's getting more difficult,

45
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,634
but I take everything they offer me.

46
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,154
Do you see Alberto?

47
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,755
- I think he was in Argentina.
- No, no, in Mexico.

48
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:30,038
He was working on some soap operas,
but he's back now.

49
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:36,031
I bumped into him at a Latin film festival
on the Riviera Maya.

50
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:42,117
He was lovely. It was some time ago,
but it was a very, very nice meeting.

51
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,755
Have you seen him?

52
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:48,311
No, no. I haven't seen him
since the premiere of <i>Flavor.</i>

53
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,438
But that was... 30 years ago.

54
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,670
Thirty-two.

55
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,712
You know, I saw the movie again last week.

56
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,717
- You hadn't watched it again?
- No, not since the premiere.

57
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,518
And it's wrong to say this, but it moved me.

58
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,593
I've always loved it.

59
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,954
No, the cinematheque restored the negative,
and they're going to hold some screenings.

60
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,856
They asked me to present it, and I thought
it would be good to do it with Alberto.

61
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,837
I'm glad you're not holding a grudge.

62
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,560
The bastard never did the character I wrote.

63
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,680
I wanted to kill him.

64
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:30,000
But... I don't really hold grudges.

65
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,313
Having seen the movie again,
his acting is better now than 30 years ago.

66
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,995
It's your eyes that changed, honey.

67
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,799
It's the same movie.

68
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,433
Do you know how to find him?

69
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,990
He lives in El Escorial.

70
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,833
Yeah, at somebody's house.

71
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,116
He works once in a while,

72
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:55,035
but he looks good, without giving up...
Well, you know what I mean.

73
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,230
I'm surprised it's you who's not working.

74
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:02,472
I always thought you'd be
the one to never retire.

75
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,789
Same here.

76
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,000
- Do you still have the same number?
- Yeah.

77
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:10,391
I'll send you his contact info,
and I'll send mine too,

78
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:14,360
in case you ever get bored
and write something only I can do.

79
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,392
Here we are.
I leave you with Father José María.

80
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,960
Good morning, boys.

81
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:06,671
The first thing we're going to do is choose
the members of the chorus.

82
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:10,071
Has anybody sung in a chorus before?
Raise your hand.

83
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,360
Okay, we're going to have a test.

84
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,397
You, come here. Yes, you.

85
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,711
- What's your name?
- Rodolfo.

86
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,360
Rodolfo, let's check out your vocalization.

87
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,840
Repeat after me.

88
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,558
You, next to him.

89
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,040
What's your name?

90
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,352
- Salvador.
- Beautiful name. Do you like to sing?

91
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,355
- I don't know.
- But you like music, right?

92
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,796
Yes, I like The Beatles and movies.

93
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:55,397
Well, here we will broaden and direct
your tastes towards less pagan subjects.

94
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,991
Let's do a vocalization test.

95
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,034
Let's warm up those voices, boys.

96
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,830
<i>That's how I became the chorus soloist.</i>

97
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,433
<i>The priests decided that I shouldn't go
to geography and history classes,</i>

98
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,791
<i>or science and art history.</i>

99
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,993
<i>The first three years of high school,</i>

100
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,869
<i>I rehearsed during the hours
of those classes</i>

101
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,599
<i>and I always passed.</i>

102
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,036
<i>They made me into a complete ignoramus</i>

103
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:02,995
<i>who passed every class
without actually taking the exams.</i>

104
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,960
GEOGRAPHY

105
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:16,276
<i>Eventually, I became a film director.</i>

106
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,875
<i>And I started to learn Spanish geography</i>

107
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,919
<i>by traveling to promote
the films I directed.</i>

108
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,640
<i>I traveled because I was successful.</i>

109
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:31,557
<i>My knowledge of geography matched
the expansion of my career.</i>

110
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,840
ANATOMY

111
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,433
<i>I started to know my body</i>

112
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:42,036
<i>through pain and illness.</i>

113
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:46,393
<i>I lived my first 30 years
pretty much in the dark,</i>

114
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,759
<i>but soon I discovered that my head
and what was inside it,</i>

115
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:54,151
<i>besides being a source
of pleasure and knowledge,</i>

116
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,358
<i>held infinite possibilities for pain.</i>

117
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,593
<i>Soon I found insomnia,</i>

118
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:08,160
<i>chronic pharyngitis, otitis, acid reflux,
ulcers, and intrinsic asthma.</i>

119
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,118
<i>Nerves in general
and the sciatic nerve in particular.</i>

120
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,876
<i>And all kinds of muscular pain:</i>

121
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:26,280
<i>Lumbar, dorsal, tendinitis,
both knees and shoulders.</i>

122
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,240
<i>This is tinnitus.</i>

123
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,515
<i>I have it too.</i>

124
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,672
<i>This is wheezing.</i>

125
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,274
<i>I also suffer from this.</i>

126
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,031
<i>Besides tinnitus and wheezing,</i>

127
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:53,397
<i>headaches are my specialty.</i>

128
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,393
<i>Migraines, tension or cluster headaches,</i>

129
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,756
<i>and back pain.</i>

130
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,514
<i>From my lumbar spinal-fusion surgery,</i>

131
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,240
<i>which immobilized more than half of my back,</i>

132
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,917
<i>I found that my life would revolve around
the spinal column.</i>

133
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,794
<i>I became aware of each one of the vertebrae</i>

134
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,315
<i>and the amount of muscles and ligaments</i>

135
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,837
<i>that make up the mythology of our body.</i>

136
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,957
<i>And just like the Greek gods,</i>

137
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:24,000
<i>the only way we can relate
is through sacrifice.</i>

138
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,431
<i>But not all is as physical
and illustratable.</i>

139
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,479
<i>I also suffer from abstract sorrows.</i>

140
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,792
<i>Aches of the soul, like panic and anxiety,</i>

141
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,918
<i>that add angst and horror to my life.</i>

142
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,392
<i>And of course,
I have toggled with depression for years.</i>

143
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,280
<i>On the nights where several aches coincide,</i>

144
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,477
<i>those nights I believe in God.</i>

145
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,040
<i>And I pray.</i>

146
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:59,352
<i>On the days that I only have
one kind of pain,</i>

147
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,510
<i>I'm an atheist.</i>

148
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,029
It's here, it's here.

149
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,794
All right.

150
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,951
- Keep the change.
- Thank you, sir.

151
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,913
- Bye, thank you.
- Good day.

152
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,714
<i>Who is it?</i>

153
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,712
Alberto, it's Salvador.

154
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,035
<i>Salvador who?</i>

155
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,270
Salvador Mallo.

156
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,470
What are you doing here?

157
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,080
I need to talk to you.

158
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,550
- About what?
<i>- Flavor.</i>

159
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,756
Can I come in?

160
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,119
Want something to drink?

161
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,600
Whatever you're having.

162
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,194
I was making some tea.

163
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,158
Okay, then.

164
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,390
Oh, look.

165
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,755
FLAVOR

166
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,958
I love the fact that you have <i>Flavor</i> here.

167
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,793
Why have you come?

168
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,794
It took me 32 years
to reconcile myself with this film.

169
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,155
Thirty-two years.

170
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,274
Beautiful.

171
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,317
What are those trees, firs?

172
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,510
Pine.

173
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,276
Are you gonna fucking tell me
why you came to see me after 32 years?

174
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,431
The cinematheque restored <i>Flavor.</i>

175
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,671
They decided it's a classic,

176
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,595
and they included it
in a series of movies shot in Madrid.

177
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,195
They called to ask
if we could present it together.

178
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,199
And they don't know we haven't talked
to each other since the shoot?

179
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,590
If they know, they didn't say anything.

180
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,030
Alberto,

181
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:11,477
gossip gets old, like people.

182
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:14,792
- Listen, do you mind if we sit down?
- No, no, sit down.

183
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,473
Thank you very much.

184
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,718
But why do you want
to present it together now?

185
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,632
Because you didn't present it
at the premiere.

186
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,040
Because you didn't let me, fag.

187
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,550
That's why I think it's fair that both of us
present it at the cinematheque.

188
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,514
Who gave you my address?

189
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,680
Zulema.

190
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,520
I bumped into her and we talked about you.

191
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,111
Listen, I'm gonna chase the dragon.
If it repulses you, you can go.

192
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,476
And we'll call each other
for the cinematheque thing.

193
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,640
Can I have some?

194
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,559
I don't recognize you, Salvador.

195
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,714
- What, it's your first time?
- Yeah.

196
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,998
And why do you want to try heroin now?

197
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,756
I'm curious.

198
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,235
You must be doing research for something.

199
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,438
The drop, the drop, the drop.

200
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,954
<i>Salvador.</i>

201
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,799
Salva.

202
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,880
Salva!

203
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,398
Come here and help me.

204
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,153
Mom, I found a novel.

205
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,754
Very good, put it there.

206
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,115
Grab this.

207
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,034
How the hell could I know
it was a holiday here?

208
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,112
It's not a holiday in our town.

209
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,429
I didn't know either.

210
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,231
What a night we're going to have, son.

211
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,835
How embarrassing.

212
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,758
Open the chocolate, Salvador.

213
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,840
Okay, Mom.

214
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,312
Mom, there are two trading cards.

215
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,279
Leave them, son. Come on, let's eat.

216
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:23,559
Liz Taylor and Robert Taylor.
Do you think they're brother and sister?

217
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,756
Well, I guess.

218
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,040
Eat.

219
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,711
Oh, what a shame, son.

220
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,513
We're here like gypsies.

221
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,993
I like the station.

222
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:45,236
You're so imaginative.
I don't know who you got that from.

223
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:48,040
Cover yourself, don't get sick.

224
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,072
Oh, my God, what's that tomato?

225
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,400
I hadn't seen that.

226
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,278
Give it to me. I'll stitch it.

227
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,189
Look, with the egg.

228
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,157
Move over there, go to sleep.

229
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,072
Did you know that your dad in the army...

230
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:19,717
learned how to sew and mend and iron shirts?

231
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,870
He was very good at it.

232
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,120
Do you think I'll join the army?

233
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,760
I guess you'll have to, son.

234
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,672
I don't want to join the army.

235
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,719
And I don't want you to go. That's useless.

236
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,678
- Mom.
- Yes?

237
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,800
Do you think
Liz Taylor mends Robert Taylor's socks?

238
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,436
I don't know.

239
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:49,474
In the pictures,
she doesn't look like she likes sewing.

240
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,430
Are you okay?

241
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,915
Don't forget to breathe, eh?

242
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
No.

243
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:10,519
My God, what a long night.
I thought we were never gonna make it.

244
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,195
I told you to wait a few days
until I was settled in.

245
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,273
- Your mother was sick of us.
- Don't say that.

246
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,393
Oh, no? Do you know what she said
three days ago?

247
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:22,712
"This month's bread bill has skyrocketed."
Can you believe it?

248
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,076
Don't mind her, woman. You know how she is.

249
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,432
I won't be a burden on anyone.

250
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,035
That same day I packed our bags,
and here we are.

251
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,680
Salva! Salva, come here.

252
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:36,356
- Or do you prefer to be alone?
- Jacinta, please, don't say that.

253
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:39,274
I'm just saying,
you could've waited a few days.

254
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,352
- Is it much further?
- No.

255
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,750
We're here.

256
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,991
Our house is here?

257
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,196
We're on top of it.

258
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,152
What do you mean, on top?

259
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,240
On top.

260
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,720
- A cave?
- It's the best I could do.

261
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:11,751
- For chrissake, Venancio, a cave?
- Salva, come on, let's go.

262
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,069
But how are we going to live in a cave?!

263
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:21,393
There are more than 300 families living
in caves. It's typical of this village.

264
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,437
There's no shame in that.

265
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,989
Is this our house, Dad?

266
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,720
This is it, son. This is it.

267
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,990
A cave!

268
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,359
Oh, my God.

269
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,951
Leaving town and coming here was your idea.

270
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,396
What would they say if they saw us now?

271
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,958
I haven't had time to whitewash,
that's why I wanted you to wait a little.

272
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,400
Everything's a mess.

273
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,520
It still needs some fixing up.

274
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,273
Mom, look, the sky!

275
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Look.

276
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,476
I cleaned up the best I could.

277
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,273
Are you happy we came?

278
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,319
Jacinta, I wanted something else for you.

279
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:03,000
You think I'm happy bringing you to a cave?

280
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,069
There wasn't anything else.

281
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:08,392
It's okay.
I'll fix it so it looks like a house.

282
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,480
Come on.

283
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,039
But your mother, really...

284
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,356
Complaining about the bread
in front of the kid.

285
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,274
Look, he loves it.

286
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,592
I don't want you to be so serious.
You look ugly.

287
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,551
Dad, can I sweep up?

288
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,470
No, I need a taxi to pick me up at...

289
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,480
One second.

290
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:36,440
- What's the address?
- 89 Ponton Street.

291
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,313
89 Ponton Street.

292
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,040
In San Lorenzo de El Escorial, yeah.

293
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:45,239
The destination is
108 Paseo del Pintor Rosales.

294
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,516
Yeah, Madrid. That's right.

295
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,399
Good, very good.
Fifteen minutes, fine, thanks.

296
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,476
- The cinematheque thing is clear, right?
- Yeah.

297
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,711
On the 18th. In three weeks.

298
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,190
- I'm already thinking about the outfit.
- Good.

299
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,112
But we'll talk before that, won't we?

300
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,475
- Okay.
- What are you doing?

301
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,995
Aren't we going to kiss
like old lady friends?

302
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,992
We even chased the dragon together.

303
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,560
Okay, okay.

304
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,560
Hello.

305
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,396
Mrs. Mercedes called
and said to call her when you can

306
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,559
- Hello.
<i>- It's... It's me.</i>

307
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:59,195
Salvador, is it true about the cinematheque?

308
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,839
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

309
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:03,355
<i>Keep me updated. Don't ignore me so much.</i>

310
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,795
I was gonna tell you.

311
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,714
<i>I love that they're showing</i> Flavor
<i>and that you're going out.</i>

312
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,315
<i>But are you sure you want a Q&A?</i>

313
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,995
<i>- It'll be packed.</i>
- No, I don't want a Q&A.

314
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,471
But I'm curious to see if the film
has survived these past 30 years.

315
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,676
<i>Don't doubt it.</i>

316
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:21,798
But if you decide not to go,
tell me and I'll fix it, okay?

317
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,031
It's better to cancel now
than at the last minute.

318
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,395
All right, bye.

319
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:30,355
I'm leaving, do you need anything?

320
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:33,478
- No, thanks, Maya, see you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow.

321
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,475
<i>"I was the loneliest man
death has ever seen.</i>

322
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:41,792
<i>I entered the room where Johannes was.</i>

323
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:46,796
<i>He had turned around and curled up,
so there was no room for me.</i>

324
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:52,114
<i>When I tried to make some space,
he woke up and we made love.</i>

325
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:56,592
<i>But loneliness was with me
and I couldn't expel it from my heart.</i>

326
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:00,230
<i>We were as close as two people can be,</i>

327
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,152
<i>but each one in his own world."</i>

328
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:39,190
Hi. Weren't you going to open the door?

329
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,351
I wasn't expecting anybody
and I have a headache.

330
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,194
- I can leave if you want me to.
- No, come in now that you're here.

331
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,113
Do you live like this?

332
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,193
- In the dark?
- When I have a headache, yes.

333
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:59,239
Poor guy. What a great house you have, man.

334
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,870
Want something to drink?

335
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,235
Any kind of alcohol.

336
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,756
Wonderful.

337
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,636
What...? What should I do? What...?

338
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,677
Breathe through your nose.
Through your nose.

339
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,035
Through your nose.

340
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,038
Wait, wait. Water.

341
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,190
Calm down. Here.

342
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,238
Wait. Breathe.

343
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,520
Drink.

344
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:37,077
Careful. Drink. Slowly, slowly, slowly.

345
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,831
Fuck! I choke on everything.

346
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,910
Fuck, it was scary.
I thought you were choking to death.

347
00:27:56,360 --> 00:28:00,354
I'm okay. It happens every once in a while.
And it's horrible.

348
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,313
THE ADDICTION

349
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:32,477
<i>"My idea of the movie theater was always
linked to the breeze of summer nights.</i>

350
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,831
<i>We only watched movies in the summer."</i>

351
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:42,080
Movies were screened on
a huge whitewashed wall.

352
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:47,157
I remember especially the movies with water.

353
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,954
Waterfalls, beaches,

354
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:54,549
the bottom of the ocean, rivers or springs.

355
00:30:55,040 --> 00:31:00,115
Hearing the sound of the water
made us kids want to pee really bad.

356
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:03,671
And we would do it right there,
on both sides of the screen.

357
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,876
My childhood movie theater
always smells like pee.

358
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:13,151
And jasmine. And a summer breeze.

359
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,434
What are you doing there?

360
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,476
I'm reading you.

361
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,678
I just read "The Addiction."

362
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,240
Well, you shouldn't.

363
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:41,233
I had to do something. You were groggy.

364
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:43,760
May I?

365
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:46,880
Yeah, yeah.

366
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,036
Oh, delicious!

367
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,800
Hey, I loved the short story, man.

368
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,314
It's not a short story.

369
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,869
Okay, whatever it is.

370
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,475
It could be brought to the stage
just like it is.

371
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:05,110
- Thanks, but it's not a dramatic text.
- Doesn't matter.

372
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,477
I could interpret it.
I know very well what it's about.

373
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:11,997
You?
You're on the opposite side of that text.

374
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:17,796
You forget, I'm an actor.
And I'm very good at suffering.

375
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,669
Salvador, I need to act again.

376
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,712
I climbed down my pedestal
a long time ago.

377
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,354
Look, I'm in contact
with the Mirador Theater.

378
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:35,956
I know it's a very small theater,
very "off,"

379
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,918
to stage Cocteau's
<i>Le Bel Indifférent.</i>

380
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,392
With men, to give it a twist.

381
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:44,957
But to tell you the truth,
I prefer your text by far.

382
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,040
Give me a copy

383
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:48,112
- and I'll give it to the director.
- Stop, stop.

384
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,839
I don't get it. Why'd you write it?

385
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:53,436
I wrote it to forget about it,
but I don't want to talk about that.

386
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,753
Would you mind giving me the rest of it?
Here.

387
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:01,992
I'm not a drug dealer, man. Here.

388
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,116
It's yours.

389
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,317
But manage it with discretion.

390
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:09,996
Because these late discoveries
are the worst. And you look like a killer.

391
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,354
Hey, think about what I told you
about the Mirador Theater.

392
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,669
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

393
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,399
- Is your headache gone?
- Completely.

394
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,119
- See?
- That's right.

395
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,554
Think he's on his way?

396
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,200
I don't know. You handled this yourself.

397
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:56,114
I don't get it.
I showed him the restoration, he loved it.

398
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:59,511
- The bathroom?
- Yeah, on the left.

399
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,710
Why don't you call him?

400
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:05,113
- Is there gonna be a Q&A?
- Yes, yes, yes. The director's on his way.

401
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,200
All right.

402
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,670
The cinematheque.

403
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,314
Yeah, right, right.

404
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,954
I can't believe it, man.

405
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:25,231
You make such a big deal
and then you don't show up.

406
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,956
The trouble I went through
to borrow this jacket...

407
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,120
You go.

408
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,560
How can I go by myself?

409
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:37,599
- I don't want them to see me like this.
- How?

410
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:40,474
We're not going to a beauty pageant,
it's a fucking Q&A.

411
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,870
I don't want them to see me drugged
and hesitant.

412
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:48,040
Once you go on-stage, you get invigorated.

413
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,236
You've been great.

414
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,358
Hey, that was before.
And I didn't smoke heroin.

415
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,120
- Salvador, where are you?
- At home.

416
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:06,038
Still?
The movie ended, the audience is waiting.

417
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,236
<i>Oh, yeah?</i>

418
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,796
I'm with Salvador Mallo.

419
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,200
We both were thinking about coming.

420
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,158
Alberto Crespo is with me.

421
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,311
And the protagonist, Alberto Crespo.

422
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:25,633
Would you mind applauding again so
they can hear it? Maybe they'll come, then.

423
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,795
- Is everybody listening?
- Yes, Salvador.

424
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:44,558
Well, I would like to apologize
to the audience.

425
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:48,270
I didn't feel good at the last minute.

426
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,159
<i>I'm with Alberto Crespo.</i>

427
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,799
He stayed here with me.

428
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,240
<i>Salvador, excuse me.</i>

429
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:58,518
Someone is raising his hand,
I think he wants to ask you something.

430
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:02,150
It's a small question for the director.

431
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:06,917
<i>Mr. Mallo, what do you think about
Alberto Crespo's interpretation in the film?</i>

432
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,199
<i>Some say that you didn't like it
and you two grew apart because of it.</i>

433
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,353
Salvador, did you hear the question?

434
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,996
Yeah, yeah, I heard it.

435
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:24,756
I read that you had an argument
after <i>Flavor.</i>

436
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,320
<i>That you hadn't seen each other.</i>

437
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:30,599
Look... Time is mysterious.

438
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:34,754
I saw the film again a month ago,
and I think Alberto's interpretation

439
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,839
has improved a lot since the premiere.

440
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,510
What was it that you didn't like then?

441
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,920
His tediousness.

442
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,600
His lethal rhythm.

443
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:52,031
I conceived a dynamic character,

444
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:54,351
a funny, sarcastic cocaine addict.

445
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,473
Alberto didn't have the lightness
I was asking for.

446
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,880
Not because he was incapable,

447
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:02,317
but because he used the opposite drug
of his character, heroin.

448
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,915
And, well, the rhythm of his interpretation

449
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,596
<i>was more serious,
and the humor of the text disappeared.</i>

450
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:13,357
But I have to be fair. Now I believe
that seriousness suits the character.

451
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,478
It gives him... weight.

452
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,231
How dare you.

453
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,471
I wasn't planning on saying it,
but it's done.

454
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,154
Be careful with me, eh?

455
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,156
I won't allow you to humiliate me again.

456
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:36,031
- Who the fuck do you think you are?
- I just told the truth.

457
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:39,033
Before filming, you promised me
you wouldn't use heroin.

458
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,237
I gave you the role on that condition
and you lied!

459
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:44,558
You did whatever the hell you wanted
and I had to tell you someday!

460
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,199
You're fucking crazy.

461
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,596
- I gave him all the messages.
- Right.

462
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,311
He's been avoiding me.

463
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:14,235
- Are you sure he's okay?
- He eats very little and chokes a lot.

464
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,393
Puree everything you make.

465
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:21,471
- Does he go out for walks?
- I don't see him.

466
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:24,758
But he walks around the house,
in the hallway.

467
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:25,800
Right.

468
00:39:25,801 --> 00:39:29,317
I saw some moccasins at the entrance,
and he never liked moccasins.

469
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,950
He wears them. Even though he has tons
of nice tennis shoes.

470
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:37,637
Maya, tell him you don't mind
tying his shoes or his tennis shoes.

471
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:40,997
It must be hard for him
to tie his own shoelaces. Poor thing.

472
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:44,152
Sure, I tell him that, Mrs. Mercedes.
But he doesn't want me to.

473
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:47,392
I think he's embarrassed,
and I feel sorry for him.

474
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,358
I don't know what to do.

475
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,239
Well, smile and take care of him.

476
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,472
And if you see something strange, call me.

477
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:59,195
Mrs. Mercedes, everything's strange here.

478
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,320
Right.

479
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,799
May I help you?

480
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:43,800
I don't know.

481
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,070
What are you looking for?

482
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:48,990
Two stamp bags.

483
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,280
Ten euros.

484
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,993
- Ten euros?
- Yeah.

485
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:01,074
But don't bring me some shitty thing.
If it's good, I'll come back.

486
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,389
Give me the money.

487
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:06,196
- No, no, no. When you bring the merchandise.
- You pay cash now.

488
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,796
Wait for me here.

489
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:21,352
Come on! I'm gonna kill you. Come on!

490
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,840
- Come on!
- Want to fight?

491
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,354
Faggot, come on!

492
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:28,559
- Faggot!
- Come on, I'm gonna kill you, come on!

493
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:35,359
Come here. Come here.

494
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,551
Come here! Come on!

495
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:10,314
Look at the kid.
So little and look at him reading.

496
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:14,553
Listen, do you know how to write too?

497
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:15,994
Yes.

498
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:19,869
How much would you charge us
for writing a letter to my aunt in Bilbao?

499
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,189
I don't know.

500
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,240
What's going on?

501
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:27,557
We wanted your son to write a letter for us.

502
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:29,711
Because my boyfriend is illiterate.

503
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:32,395
When am I gonna learn,
if I'm working all day long?

504
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,711
If you didn't waste your time drawing...

505
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,996
- Are you a bricklayer?
- And a painter.

506
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:40,593
Right. It's a shame that you're illiterate,
being so handsome.

507
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,070
My Salvador can teach you to read and write.

508
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:45,640
Right?

509
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:49,076
In the evenings, when you're done with work.

510
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:51,554
At the best time for you.

511
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:56,311
- Could you teach me math too?
- Yes.

512
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,995
Of course.
The four rules, so nobody cheats you.

513
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:02,912
It's backwards to be illiterate
in this world we live.

514
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:07,075
I'll bring pen and paper
to write the letter, okay?

515
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:11,192
- How much would you charge us?
- Nothing, woman. Nothing.

516
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,873
Since you're a bricklayer,

517
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:16,920
you could help me finish the kitchen
and paint the walls a little bit, eh?

518
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,913
- Whenever you can.
- It can only be Sunday.

519
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,673
Sundays, all right.

520
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:25,640
In exchange, my Salvador will teach you
to read and write, the four rules,

521
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:27,473
and today's letter for free.

522
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:28,560
Thank you.

523
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:33,712
A, B, C,

524
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:35,672
CH, D...

525
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:40,079
Eduardo, when are you putting the sink in?
I have to wash everything in these buckets.

526
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:43,236
I wanted to finish
whitewashing the walls first.

527
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:45,118
No, the sink is more urgent.

528
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,072
I'm used to the walls like this.

529
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:53,514
It's just that Salvador gives me
a lot of homework, and I don't have time.

530
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:54,750
Salvador?

531
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:57,355
If he wants to learn to read and write,

532
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:00,353
- he needs to memorize the alphabet.
- Okay.

533
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:02,671
Come on, Eduardo. Start again.

534
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:07,430
A, B, C,

535
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:11,352
CH, F, J...

536
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,079
No, Eduardo.

537
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:17,677
It's F, G, H, I, J, K.

538
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:21,510
- You said it right before.
- There are too many letters.

539
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:23,717
Stop complaining. It is what it is.

540
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:28,356
No, Eduardo. You don't hold it like that,
give me the pencil.

541
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:32,036
Look. You hold it like this, okay?

542
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:34,874
Now you do it.

543
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:37,429
- Like this?
- Yes, yes.

544
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:45,752
No, Eduardo.
You don't have to hold it so tight.

545
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:48,594
Relax your hand. I'll guide it.

546
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:53,472
- U...
- U...

547
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,913
I'm a little nervous.

548
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,152
It's okay. It's much better.

549
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:03,516
- Do you like to draw?
- A lot.

550
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:05,990
Then you'll learn to write very quickly.

551
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:09,471
Because writing is like drawing
but with letters.

552
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:11,193
Now you do it by yourself.

553
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,200
That's it.

554
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:25,832
Read the sentence.

555
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:26,956
"One...

556
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:30,558
holy...

557
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:36,151
catholic...

558
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:44,239
apostolic."

559
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:48,154
"One, holy, catholic, apostolic."

560
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:51,480
Who's that?

561
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:55,150
Spain. Who else?

562
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,639
Write it all continuously.

563
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:07,597
Very good, Eduardo.
You're stopping much less than before.

564
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:12,000
There are tons of invitations.

565
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:15,670
- It wouldn't hurt you to go out somewhere.
- "Cecil Beaton."

566
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,956
- I'll go with you wherever you want.
- I wish.

567
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:19,713
The dance season started.

568
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:22,998
Dimitris Papaioannou and Jan Fabre
are coming to the Canal Theaters.

569
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:27,471
Public theater seats are
the most uncomfortable for me.

570
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:29,279
And I don't want to leave in the middle.

571
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:35,875
Have you seen Dr. Galindo?

572
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:39,032
No. I'm fed up with doctors.

573
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:42,159
How do you get the oxycodone?

574
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:47,597
A friend gets it for me.
His mother's a pharmacist.

575
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:53,440
This book came for you.

576
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:59,476
<i>"How to End Counterculture."</i>

577
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:00,560
Whatever.

578
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:06,754
The Guggenheim is asking us for two
Pérez Villalta paintings, for an anthology.

579
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:08,160
No, no. Tell them no.

580
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:12,632
Those paintings are my only company.
I live with those paintings, Mercedes.

581
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:17,600
Excuse me.

582
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:23,440
Hi.

583
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:25,480
Talk to me.

584
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:28,320
Yes.

585
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:13,633
Yeah, yeah, I'm listening.

586
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:20,199
I have to go.
I can't... I can't keep talking.

587
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:27,351
It's none of your business where I am.

588
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:35,439
Is there something wrong?

589
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:36,520
No.

590
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:39,114
Luis and I are splitting up.

591
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:42,072
I didn't know you had problems.

592
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:44,600
I didn't want to bother you.

593
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:47,599
This is an old issue and...

594
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:52,995
And now that I have to be at home so much,
I couldn't keep lying to myself.

595
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:56,000
I'm sorry.

596
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:57,679
So, if you don't mind,

597
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:01,714
I would like to keep
taking care of your mail.

598
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:03,871
People like getting an answer.

599
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,229
But it's always a no.

600
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:07,993
Well, you should do something.

601
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:10,993
You have too much free time
to think about your illnesses.

602
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:13,231
Give your brain
something to entertain itself.

603
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:15,835
I'd like to do some things too, Mercedes.

604
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:20,949
You could write.

605
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,914
You have a ton of documents full of ideas
to develop. I'll make you a list.

606
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,720
No,
I don't want to write if I can't film it.

607
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:32,510
You know better than anybody
that I can't face a shoot in this state.

608
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:37,476
Without filming, my life has no purpose.

609
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:41,837
But that's just how things are.

610
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:45,554
Call me, okay?

611
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:47,871
- Call me for whatever you need.
- Yeah.

612
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,798
Jacinta,

613
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:07,156
the cave looks beautiful.

614
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:10,392
Oh, and that light, my God, it's wonderful.

615
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:11,996
It rains sometimes.

616
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:16,474
You can't be so selfish, Jacinta.

617
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:20,474
Rain is necessary.
Think of the countryside, of farmers.

618
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:22,438
- Well, it's true.
- Of course.

619
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:27,437
Okay, Salvador. Let's see...

620
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:32,199
Since your mother told me that, at
9 years old, you were a teacher, I thought:

621
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:33,919
"This boy must be for God."

622
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,798
He's always been ahead of boys his age.

623
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:38,871
- Do you like to teach, Salvador?
- Yes.

624
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:41,680
- And would you like to study?
- Yes, very much.

625
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:42,760
Why?

626
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:46,991
To know more
and be able to teach more things.

627
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:49,280
Very good.

628
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:54,114
Very good. That's what I call a calling.

629
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:56,496
I'll talk to Father José María,
and he'll take care of everything.

630
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:57,715
Thank you very much.

631
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:03,559
Salvador, next year,
you're going to high school at a seminary.

632
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:08,232
We'll see how you behave.
Not everybody gets a scholarship.

633
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:11,631
- So the scholarship is a sure thing?
- Yes, woman.

634
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:13,154
Don't worry.

635
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:15,233
And we'll see how you make me look.

636
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:17,551
Think, you're one of the chosen ones.

637
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:22,716
Well, I'm leaving.
I still have one visit to make.

638
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:26,316
- Don't you want some more juice?
- No, thanks. It was really good.

639
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:27,400
Bye, Salvador.

640
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,951
The whitewashed walls
look very nice, Jacinta.

641
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:33,430
- Yeah? It's better.
- It's beautiful.

642
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:35,796
To tell you the truth,
I'm quite jealous of you.

643
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:36,880
Me?

644
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:40,311
Sure, you live in catacombs
like ancient Christians.

645
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,278
Well, yeah, that's right.

646
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,273
Should I come sew on Sunday?

647
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:47,716
Yes, I'll see you on Sunday at home.

648
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:49,598
- Thanks a lot.
- You're welcome.

649
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:56,993
- Mom.
- What, honey?

650
00:51:57,080 --> 00:52:00,278
Is a seminary the place to become a priest?

651
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:01,360
Yes.

652
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:05,919
Do you want me to make you
the Spanish tortilla you like?

653
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Handsome!

654
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:08,914
I don't want to be a priest!

655
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:12,314
You don't have to be.

656
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:14,477
Then why do you want me to go to a seminary?

657
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:18,713
Because the poor have no other way
of studying. That's why.

658
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:21,109
What do you want me to do?

659
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:28,030
Salvador.

660
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:30,990
Salvador!

661
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:34,790
Salvador!

662
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:43,520
That boy...

663
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:48,795
Salvador! Come down from there!

664
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:52,596
- Come down.
- I don't want to go to the seminary.

665
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:56,840
You can leave when you finish high school.

666
00:52:56,920 --> 00:53:00,072
We'll figure out a way
for you to have a career.

667
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:02,072
So you don't have to live like your father.

668
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:05,471
I don't want to go to school.
I want to stay here.

669
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:07,517
And what will you do here, son?

670
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:08,920
What will you do here?

671
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:12,676
Break your back working in the fields?
Or in construction? Is that what you want?

672
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:15,553
I don't want to be a priest.

673
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:21,193
<i>"Life disgusts me as a useless medicine.</i>

674
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:25,238
<i>It is then when I clearly feel</i>

675
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:28,233
<i>how easy it would be to get away
from this tediousness</i>

676
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:32,030
<i>if I had the simple strength
to want to really push it away."</i>

677
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:43,520
<i>Who is it?</i>

678
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:46,035
- It's me.
<i>- Go away.</i>

679
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:58,073
- If you don't leave, I'll call the police.
- Alberto, I'm here to negotiate.

680
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:00,436
I'll give you the rights
to interpret "The Addiction."

681
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:01,874
I don't believe you.

682
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:03,872
- Go away. I'm busy.
- I mean it.

683
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:07,552
I have here a copy of the text.
Please, open the door.

684
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:14,350
If this is a trap, you'll leave more
of a hunchback than you already are.

685
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:23,393
What, are you on a hunger strike?

686
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:28,194
Are you still thinking of doing everything
at the Mirador Theater?

687
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:30,440
Yes.

688
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:36,072
But I have a lot of doubts.
The text is very nice, but it's obsolete.

689
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:41,432
If you really give me "The Addiction,"
I'll get completely into it.

690
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:43,801
I would have to tell the people
at the Mirador, of course.

691
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:47,040
Here it is.

692
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:50,320
Why the change?

693
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,790
I looked at the text,
like you said, and...

694
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:58,111
- I'll tell you more if you give me some tea.
- Sure.

695
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:02,673
Anything else?

696
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:05,195
Yes, I don't want to sign it.
And don't say it's mine.

697
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:08,836
- I don't want to appear anywhere.
- All right. Will you direct me?

698
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:11,109
No, no.

699
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:12,554
- Man, that would help.
- No, no.

700
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:17,317
Give it to the theater, and let them read it
and see if they're interested.

701
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:19,437
But don't give my name.

702
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:21,591
- So who's the author?
- You are.

703
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:24,677
Or we make up a pseudonym.

704
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:28,919
No, no, no. I'll sign it. I'll sign it.
But I don't get you.

705
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,480
It's a confessional text.

706
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:36,840
- I don't want anybody to identify me.
- Right.

707
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:43,435
Regarding the staging,

708
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:46,319
I suggest an empty stage,

709
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:48,995
a screen, a chair.

710
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:51,390
If you don't know what to do
with your arms and hands.

711
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:54,279
I know well what to do
with my arms and hands.

712
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:55,953
After the corrections,

713
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:58,720
I admit, it is a bit less melodramatic.

714
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:02,237
Don't worry. I can also control melodrama.

715
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:04,357
My years in Mexico will be of use.

716
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:07,956
That's why I'm telling you,
you must avoid sentimentalism.

717
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:12,193
Control your emotions, don't cry.
You actors use any excuse to cry.

718
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:16,069
The better actor is not the one that cries,
but the one that fights the tears.

719
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:18,839
Let me give you a kiss, you faggot.

720
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:28,550
Listen, if you don't mind,
I'll start working right away.

721
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:30,871
If you want to stay, this is your house.

722
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:35,637
By the way, I have a ton of magazines
from the '80s. You appear in some of them.

723
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:36,915
Dressed as a woman.

724
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:42,199
- You forget about that too soon.
- Okay, but before, give me something.

725
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:47,480
And give me your dealer's address. Tell him
I'll come myself to pick up the merchandise.

726
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:50,871
That's not necessary. Now they bring it
to your house, like a pizza.

727
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:55,040
Lighter.

728
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:10,396
Here.

729
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:14,914
- No. Not yet.
- Why?

730
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:19,397
I'm lowering my dose just enough
to be able to work.

731
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:20,675
Can you do it?

732
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:24,510
How do you think I'm here?

733
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:27,395
Coming and going.

734
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:31,675
It's slavery.

735
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:35,557
But this play is vital for me.

736
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:39,111
And I must do it as clean as I can.

737
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:43,072
I don't want to lose one bit...

738
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:46,675
of the feeling you put into these pages.

739
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:53,794
Will you come see me?

740
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:56,349
I don't know. I don't think so.

741
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:58,159
This time I'm not doing Shakespeare.

742
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:02,313
Or Chekhov, or Lorca.

743
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:03,595
I'm doing you.

744
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:07,396
I'll feel terrible if you do it wrong.

745
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:11,997
And if you do it right,
I'll feel much worse.

746
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:20,960
"My childhood movie theater...

747
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:22,440
always smells like pee."

748
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:24,350
And jasmine.

749
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:26,913
And a summer breeze.

750
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:18,880
I met Marcelo in a bathroom full of people.

751
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:24,513
It wasn't the first time I saw him.

752
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:27,790
But it was that night...

753
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:31,392
after casually rubbing against each other...

754
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:34,951
when I found out I liked that boy.

755
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:40,073
We spent the whole weekend in bed.

756
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:42,436
And without realizing it,
a year had gone by.

757
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:45,757
And now we couldn't live without each other.

758
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:50,916
It was 1981...

759
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:53,675
and Madrid was ours.

760
00:59:57,040 --> 01:00:00,556
One day, I found Marcelo paler than usual.

761
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:03,913
Lately, he had lost weight

762
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:06,794
and had dark circles under his eyes.

763
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:14,991
I asked him if he didn't feel well,

764
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:20,190
and he confessed he had started
to fool around with heroin.

765
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:25,000
I was surprised
because I had never tried it.

766
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:28,391
I drank and sniffed cocaine
like everybody else.

767
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:30,760
But heroin, never.

768
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:35,032
I had a feeling that wasn't good,
and I didn't like it.

769
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:41,236
I was in a whirlwind, I wrote a column
on nightlife, I participated in music shows,

770
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:46,440
I sang in a parodic punk band,
I was preparing my first film, I filmed it,

771
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:48,671
it was released, it was successful.

772
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:50,877
I wrote the second one, I filmed it.

773
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,196
I did a thousand things, I didn't sleep...

774
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:56,000
while Marcelo languished
on the couch at home.

775
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:59,158
Or locked in the bathroom.

776
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:02,880
<i>Or out of the house
at someplace I didn't know about.</i>

777
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:09,118
<i>I would spend the night coming and going
from the window to the bed.</i>

778
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:12,840
<i>Waiting to hear the sound of the door.</i>

779
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:14,752
MIRADOR THEATER - ACTING SCHOOL

780
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:16,832
ADDICTION

781
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:21,480
Madrid had become a difficult arena,

782
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:23,914
like bullfighters say.

783
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:28,479
So we traveled a lot.

784
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:30,916
Anything to get out of Madrid.

785
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:34,917
The worst were the first few days.

786
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:38,960
While Marcelo recovered from the cravings,
I took care of him...

787
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:40,836
and wrote.

788
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,070
I don't know how,

789
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:45,120
but I wrote.

790
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:50,750
Marcelo was very young,
the cravings were short, three, four days.

791
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:55,278
Afterwards, we would go out
and play like little kids.

792
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:00,955
I remember Ivory Coast.

793
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:05,080
Tens of strong young guys washing
their clothes in the river.

794
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:06,680
On car tires.

795
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:09,754
The Malecón in Havana.

796
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:12,797
During the day or night.

797
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:19,714
Old Havana, sweetly pulsing to the rhythm
of nonstop percussion.

798
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:24,633
I remember Mexico City.

799
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:29,360
Marcelo and I drunk,

800
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:34,714
listening to Chavela Vargas sing
"La Noche de mi Amor."

801
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:38,635
<i>I want</i>

802
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:43,795
<i>The happiness of a boat returning</i>

803
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:51,390
<i>A thousand bells of glory ringing...</i>

804
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:01,040
The only reason for those trips was
to escape Madrid.

805
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:03,476
Escaping from the heroin...

806
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:08,237
became my best learning experience.

807
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:12,270
In those trips, I found the inspiration

808
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:16,239
to write the stories
that I would tell years later

809
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:19,231
and the colors that would illuminate them.

810
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:23,116
But we couldn't spend our lives traveling.

811
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:26,592
Sooner or later,
we had to come back to Madrid.

812
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:31,553
And Madrid was a minefield,
a dead-end street.

813
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:35,837
I was desperate, I didn't know what to do.

814
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:39,680
Except repeating myself.

815
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:44,995
The two of us repeated ourselves
for three long years.

816
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:52,676
I believed the strength of my love
would defeat his addiction.

817
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:53,830
But that didn't happen.

818
01:03:56,520 --> 01:03:57,954
Love is not enough.

819
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:02,032
Love may move mountains...

820
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:07,470
but it's not enough
to save the person you love.

821
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:31,399
Under the whitewashed wall
where my childhood movies were screened,

822
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:36,757
I would pray so nothing bad happened
to the protagonists.

823
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:41,240
But I didn't manage to do it.

824
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:45,077
Not with Natalie Wood or Marilyn.

825
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:49,879
Then I tried to save Marcelo and myself.

826
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:55,671
If Marcelo saved himself,
it was far away from me.

827
01:04:59,080 --> 01:05:00,833
And me, I stayed in Madrid.

828
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,354
And film saved me.

829
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:14,031
CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF

830
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:15,120
Come in.

831
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:21,990
Hello.

832
01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:24,115
Good evening.

833
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,036
Good evening.

834
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:28,360
Come in.

835
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:35,355
- Do we know each other?
- Yes.

836
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:39,589
I don't remember you.

837
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:45,076
A long time ago, when you were preparing
<i>Flavor</i> with Salvador Mallo...

838
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:49,512
- I'm sorry, I don't remember.
- We saw each other two or three times.

839
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:52,074
I'm Federico,

840
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:54,152
the Marcelo from your monologue.

841
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:01,154
- Did you like the show?
- I don't know.

842
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:05,597
"Like" is not the word.
It had a great impact on me.

843
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:10,431
- You were the one who was crying, right?
- Yes, I guess.

844
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:12,880
Sit down.

845
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:16,110
I suppose you have some questions for me.

846
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:22,040
Is Salvador alive?

847
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:34,034
How was the show tonight?

848
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:35,793
Very good, it was sold out.

849
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:38,314
Too bad the theater's small.

850
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:40,357
That's better, it's more intimate.

851
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:43,990
A very intimate spectator came tonight.

852
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:45,719
<i>Who?</i>

853
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:48,156
I'll tell you if you promise
to come watch me.

854
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:50,436
<i>Who is the intimate spectator?</i>

855
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:52,600
Federico.

856
01:06:52,601 --> 01:06:53,795
Federico who?

857
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:55,758
<i>Federico Delgado.</i>

858
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:56,876
<i>Your Marcelo.</i>

859
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:00,273
<i>He came to see me in the dressing room.</i>

860
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:05,749
- Did he recognize the text?
- Every word.

861
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:10,671
He asked me for your number and address.

862
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:14,639
<i>- You didn't tell him anything else?</i>
- No.

863
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:18,316
I didn't say anything
about you chasing the dragon.

864
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:22,200
<i>Thanks. I'll come and see you sometime.</i>

865
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:24,316
Right.

866
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:35,796
INCOMING CALL
DECLINE - ACCEPT

867
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:39,033
CALL FROM ARGENTINA

868
01:07:48,680 --> 01:07:50,080
<i>Salvador?</i>

869
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:52,516
- Yes.
<i>- Is it you?</i>

870
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:56,433
<i>I wouldn't have recognized your voice.
It's Federico.</i>

871
01:07:56,520 --> 01:07:58,000
Federico.

872
01:07:58,080 --> 01:07:59,196
<i>I'm in Madrid.</i>

873
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:03,834
What are you doing here?

874
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:08,119
<i>I came to see some lawyers regarding
an inheritance. I'm leaving tomorrow night.</i>

875
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:09,839
<i>I would like to see you.</i>

876
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:10,990
Me too.

877
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:15,119
But I was already in bed.

878
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:16,953
Do you mind if we meet tomorrow?

879
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:20,670
<i>Is noon okay for you? I have the meeting
with the lawyer in the afternoon.</i>

880
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:22,080
Perfect, yes.

881
01:08:23,760 --> 01:08:25,717
<i>I haven't asked you how you are.</i>

882
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:28,160
Old.

883
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:31,716
<i>Five years more than me, not one more.</i>

884
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:36,554
And you, how are you?

885
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:40,159
I'm better now.

886
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:42,960
I was devastated when I left the theater.

887
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:45,920
I went to see <i>The Addiction.</i>

888
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:50,231
- And how did you know about it?
<i>- It was a coincidence.</i>

889
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:56,678
I took a walk around Embajadores to see
our street, I was in front of our house.

890
01:08:56,760 --> 01:08:57,910
Of course.

891
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,753
The theater is up the street.

892
01:09:00,520 --> 01:09:05,515
I went in to kill time and because
I remembered Alberto Crespo from your movie.

893
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:08,115
<i>And you found yourself suddenly...</i>

894
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:10,920
Yes, suddenly.

895
01:09:13,360 --> 01:09:15,317
I don't know how to ask you to forgive me.

896
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:19,358
I didn't know how you felt.

897
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:20,954
How much you suffered.

898
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:24,432
It was a good learning experience.

899
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:25,520
<i>What?</i>

900
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:28,313
You don't have to apologize.

901
01:09:29,320 --> 01:09:31,755
I didn't do anything
that I didn't want to do, Federico.

902
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:37,432
I tried to help you

903
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:40,035
- as much as I could.
- And I'm thankful,

904
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:42,157
and I would like to be able
to prove it someday.

905
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:48,959
Listen, look. I don't think
I'll be able to sleep after this.

906
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:51,640
Would you give me 20 minutes
to take a shower and get dressed,

907
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:52,880
and I'll see you at my house?

908
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,798
All right, yes.

909
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:32,956
Hello?

910
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:36,152
<i>- This is Federico. Can you open the door?</i>
- All right.

911
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:03,560
It's been so long, son of a bitch.
Come here.

912
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:04,600
Yeah.

913
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:09,520
So long.

914
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:21,439
Would you have recognized me
if you saw me on the street?

915
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:24,433
I would've had to pay attention, but yes.

916
01:11:24,520 --> 01:11:26,193
You have the same eyes.

917
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:31,554
- I'm sorry I made you get out of bed.
- No, no. Come in.

918
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:40,000
It's like a museum.

919
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:46,471
Everything I've earned, I've invested it
in this house and these paintings.

920
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:48,000
- I'll give you a tour later.
- Yeah.

921
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:51,835
- What do you want to drink?
- Anything. Tequila?

922
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:53,513
Sure, tequila.

923
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:54,795
In honor of Chavela.

924
01:11:57,480 --> 01:12:01,394
When you mentioned her in your monologue,
I couldn't hold my tears.

925
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:03,470
Well, all right.

926
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:05,199
Tequila for Chavela

927
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:07,351
- and to celebrate our reunion.
- Yes.

928
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:15,720
I love your house.

929
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:19,271
Where do you live now?

930
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:20,999
In Buenos Aires.

931
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:23,959
You had an uncle in Buenos Aires.

932
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:26,600
Yes, I went there in '85.

933
01:12:27,680 --> 01:12:29,797
- So soon?
- Yeah.

934
01:12:32,040 --> 01:12:35,033
Do you want the story now
or after we make a toast?

935
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:39,239
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

936
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:46,480
The story.

937
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:50,918
After we split up,
I lived for a year with my parents.

938
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:54,152
At the time, the heroin routes didn't come
through Argentina.

939
01:12:54,240 --> 01:12:58,314
So I moved in with my uncle,
and I started working at his restaurant.

940
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:00,517
I couldn't use
because there wasn't any heroin.

941
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:02,239
So that was the best way to get clean.

942
01:13:03,720 --> 01:13:06,758
I met Lucrecia, my wife.

943
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:08,160
We got married.

944
01:13:08,240 --> 01:13:10,436
Now I have two older kids,

945
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:12,512
my own restaurant...

946
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:16,833
And in all these years, I've only come back
to Galicia to see my parents.

947
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:21,517
This is the first time I've come to Madrid.

948
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:26,590
As you say in your monologue,
Madrid had become

949
01:13:26,680 --> 01:13:29,240
a difficult arena for me.

950
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:30,515
A minefield.

951
01:13:31,680 --> 01:13:33,433
Too bad that you lived here.

952
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:37,640
I needed Madrid.

953
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:40,836
I also needed you.

954
01:13:42,040 --> 01:13:43,633
But not in that state.

955
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:48,709
Love is not enough to save the person
you love, you say it in your monologue.

956
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:52,111
Let's not talk about the monologue,
it's a very sad text.

957
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:57,192
I was relieved when...

958
01:13:57,280 --> 01:14:02,150
you said that while you took care of me,
you continued to evolve as a writer

959
01:14:02,240 --> 01:14:03,310
and a filmmaker.

960
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:05,153
Did you really feel that way?

961
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:10,120
You didn't interrupt anything, Federico.

962
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:11,395
On the contrary,

963
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:17,390
you filled my life
like nothing and nobody...

964
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:18,914
has filled it until now.

965
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:26,275
So you hadn't come back to Madrid
since then?

966
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:27,396
No.

967
01:14:27,480 --> 01:14:30,120
But I followed everything you did.

968
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:32,078
And... And I was happy

969
01:14:32,160 --> 01:14:36,279
when I recognized a scene
that was clearly inspired by us.

970
01:14:37,480 --> 01:14:41,838
Each one of your films was
an event in my life, and I felt proud

971
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:44,754
because you were successful
all over the world.

972
01:14:44,840 --> 01:14:49,119
You are the only Spanish director
that my family knows.

973
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:50,395
Your new family.

974
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:54,280
Yes.

975
01:14:58,280 --> 01:14:59,509
Do they know anything else?

976
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:02,953
Do you mean about us?

977
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:08,272
Lucrecia, my wife.
Well, my ex-wife, we're getting separated.

978
01:15:08,360 --> 01:15:10,750
Yes, I told her.
She doesn't know it was you.

979
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:14,197
She knows I was with a guy in Madrid
for three years.

980
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:17,358
And I also told one of my sons
to encourage him.

981
01:15:21,240 --> 01:15:23,755
In time, I'll tell him it was you.

982
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:27,629
He's a film buff and he wouldn't forgive me
if I didn't tell him.

983
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:30,555
Do you have a partner now?

984
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:32,560
Yes.

985
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:34,840
And you?

986
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:37,559
No, no.

987
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:41,475
- A man or a woman?
- A woman.

988
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:45,397
My experience with men ended with you.

989
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:50,678
I don't know how to take that.

990
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:52,160
Take it as a compliment.

991
01:15:54,680 --> 01:15:56,876
This is Mauro, the youngest one.

992
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:02,152
And this is Federico.

993
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:03,560
He's 22 now.

994
01:16:03,640 --> 01:16:05,757
- He looks a lot like you.
- Yeah.

995
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:08,230
He's the one I told about us.

996
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:10,635
Both very handsome.

997
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:14,992
You have to come to Buenos Aires,
you will love that city.

998
01:16:15,080 --> 01:16:16,958
And I'm sure it'll inspire you.

999
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:19,430
I want you to meet my family,

1000
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:23,150
to come eat at the restaurant,
to get drunk together.

1001
01:16:34,440 --> 01:16:35,920
For old times' sake.

1002
01:16:56,760 --> 01:16:58,592
Do you want me to stay tonight?

1003
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:02,157
Of course I want you to.

1004
01:17:02,240 --> 01:17:05,358
But let's close our story as God intended.

1005
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:09,878
We never cared about God,
and we can close our story tomorrow morning.

1006
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:14,750
Anyway, I'm glad to see...

1007
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:17,036
that I still turn you on.

1008
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:19,351
Me too, you are also turned on.

1009
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:22,592
Yes, go, go. Go.

1010
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:23,909
Yeah, I'm going.

1011
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:27,155
You're right.

1012
01:17:28,240 --> 01:17:30,038
As always.

1013
01:17:30,120 --> 01:17:33,591
Remember, you promised to come
and visit me in Buenos Aires.

1014
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:43,032
Have a good trip.

1015
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:47,319
- Thanks a lot for coming, really.
- I'll call you to remind you about it.

1016
01:18:53,640 --> 01:18:55,233
Yes, Salvador?

1017
01:18:55,320 --> 01:18:58,518
<i>- Mercedes, is this a good time?</i>
- Yes, yes, tell me.

1018
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:02,879
Look, I would like to see Dr. Galindo
as soon as possible.

1019
01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:04,314
- What did you have?
<i>- Nothing.</i>

1020
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:07,518
Just an anxiolytic two hours ago
and some tequila shots.

1021
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:10,240
Now I'm going to take my legal dose

1022
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:12,312
<i>of crushed pills with yogurt.</i>

1023
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:14,496
Want me to make an appointment
with the gastroenterologist?

1024
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:17,592
- Yes, as soon as possible.
<i>- All right.</i>

1025
01:19:17,680 --> 01:19:19,558
- All right, bye.
- Bye.

1026
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,515
- Salvador Mallo?
- Yes.

1027
01:19:56,600 --> 01:19:58,080
Come this way, please.

1028
01:20:05,080 --> 01:20:07,072
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

1029
01:20:07,160 --> 01:20:09,550
- Good morning, doctor.
- Morning, come in.

1030
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:12,040
PAIN UNIT
DR. A. GALINDO

1031
01:20:12,160 --> 01:20:14,117
Thank you for making room for us.

1032
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:16,715
It's okay. Talk to me, Salvador.

1033
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:21,154
My back is killing me.

1034
01:20:21,240 --> 01:20:23,391
The oxycodone has almost no effect.

1035
01:20:25,720 --> 01:20:27,996
We'll have to change the painkiller.

1036
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:30,714
How come you didn't come earlier?

1037
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:34,719
- I was in a very low mood.
- Yes, he's been very depressed.

1038
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:37,991
And what have you done to control the pain?

1039
01:20:39,560 --> 01:20:41,279
I started using heroin.

1040
01:20:46,520 --> 01:20:50,514
- And do you plan to keep using it?
- No. That's why I'm here.

1041
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:53,392
How often were you using?

1042
01:20:55,200 --> 01:20:57,396
Every two or three days.

1043
01:20:57,480 --> 01:20:58,834
In the end, every other day.

1044
01:21:00,120 --> 01:21:01,349
Smoked.

1045
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:05,553
- And when was the last time you used?
- The night before last.

1046
01:21:07,080 --> 01:21:08,833
Am I gonna have withdrawal symptoms?

1047
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:15,040
A little, but with a compassionate
and controlled detox, you won't suffer.

1048
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:16,474
Compassionate and controlled?

1049
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:17,954
Yes, that's what it's called.

1050
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:20,959
Do you have someone to assist you?

1051
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:23,600
Yeah, yeah. I'll be with him.

1052
01:21:23,680 --> 01:21:26,593
And how have you controlled this day
and a half that you haven't used?

1053
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:29,319
With anxiolytics

1054
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:30,675
and an iron will.

1055
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:33,480
Well, you'll continue to need that iron will

1056
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:35,536
because your mind already knows
the effect of heroin,

1057
01:21:35,560 --> 01:21:37,080
and that's something you don't forget.

1058
01:21:39,960 --> 01:21:42,031
Are you still taking Pamelor for your head?

1059
01:21:42,120 --> 01:21:44,840
Yes, and everything else.

1060
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:47,873
For asthma, blood pressure,

1061
01:21:47,960 --> 01:21:49,189
insomnia, yes.

1062
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:53,792
But I need you to help me especially
with my back pain.

1063
01:21:53,880 --> 01:21:57,396
And to put some order
in everything I'm taking.

1064
01:21:57,480 --> 01:21:59,233
Also with the migraines.

1065
01:21:59,320 --> 01:22:01,755
The back pain and headaches...

1066
01:22:03,240 --> 01:22:05,072
completely cripple me.

1067
01:22:05,160 --> 01:22:06,160
I understand.

1068
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:09,477
Do you have any projects, Salvador?

1069
01:22:09,560 --> 01:22:12,359
Yes, improving my quality of life.

1070
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:14,349
I'm talking about work.

1071
01:22:15,720 --> 01:22:17,518
It'd be good for you to stay busy.

1072
01:22:18,440 --> 01:22:20,159
Don't you miss it?

1073
01:22:20,240 --> 01:22:22,072
Not a day goes by that I don't think of it.

1074
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:28,553
But the question is not
whether I miss it or not.

1075
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:33,316
Film is a very physical job.

1076
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:38,031
Unfortunately, I am in no condition
to do that. Really, that's my main problem.

1077
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:43,110
- People worse off than you get ahead.
- No, I know, I know.

1078
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:44,793
But I haven't been able to do it.

1079
01:22:45,240 --> 01:22:47,835
My mother died four years ago.

1080
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:50,151
Two years later, I had back surgery.

1081
01:22:52,160 --> 01:22:55,437
I still haven't recovered
from either of those things.

1082
01:22:57,960 --> 01:22:59,314
I need help, doctor.

1083
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:02,757
Okay. I'm switching the oxycodone
for a different opioid.

1084
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:06,869
The idea of heroin will cross your mind.

1085
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:08,992
You have to be alert.

1086
01:23:09,080 --> 01:23:10,434
Yes.

1087
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:13,911
I'm going to extend your prescriptions
and then I'll give you the instructions.

1088
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:17,476
Do you mind if I step out and move a little?

1089
01:23:17,560 --> 01:23:19,438
- No, no, go ahead.
- Go on.

1090
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:22,194
- Doctor, thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

1091
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:32,876
- Okay, let's see.
- There's something else, doctor.

1092
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:36,358
Something else?

1093
01:23:36,440 --> 01:23:38,671
Salvador chokes often.

1094
01:23:38,760 --> 01:23:41,719
An hour ago, on our way to the hospital,

1095
01:23:41,800 --> 01:23:44,315
he had a sip of water
and I thought he was dying.

1096
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:48,076
The gastroenterologist performed
an endoscopy

1097
01:23:49,200 --> 01:23:51,271
and they found a lump
pressing on the esophagus.

1098
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:57,311
That's why he chokes so easily,
and we don't know what the lump is.

1099
01:23:59,880 --> 01:24:02,236
- Does he know the result of the endoscopy?
- No.

1100
01:24:03,880 --> 01:24:06,634
The doctor ordered a CAT scan to be sure,

1101
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:10,872
but the gastroenterologist
hasn't ruled out a tumor.

1102
01:24:13,640 --> 01:24:16,360
What should I do? Should I tell him?

1103
01:24:16,440 --> 01:24:19,911
No, no, no.
Save him at least two days of anxiety.

1104
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,356
And please,
call me with the CAT scan results.

1105
01:24:22,440 --> 01:24:23,440
Sure.

1106
01:24:36,120 --> 01:24:37,634
Mercedes,

1107
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:40,229
would you please hand me that box?

1108
01:24:42,280 --> 01:24:43,280
Thanks.

1109
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:49,559
Salvador, it means a lot to me
that you put me in your mom's bedroom.

1110
01:25:01,880 --> 01:25:03,872
Here's your afternoon snack.

1111
01:25:03,960 --> 01:25:06,350
Those dark muffins? Forget about it.

1112
01:25:07,720 --> 01:25:09,439
They're whole wheat.

1113
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:12,479
Someday you're going to bring me
a plate of alfalfa

1114
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:15,029
because now they say
it's good for your heart.

1115
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:18,875
And you're not going to drink your milk?
You have to try.

1116
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:20,599
Later.

1117
01:25:20,680 --> 01:25:21,830
Sit down.

1118
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:26,520
What are you doing?

1119
01:25:26,640 --> 01:25:29,553
I'm trying to disentangle these rosaries.

1120
01:25:29,640 --> 01:25:32,394
- Here, I'll help you.
- No. You don't know how.

1121
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:42,871
- Do you remember how you need to shroud me?
- Yes, Mom, yes.

1122
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:45,350
If we are in the village, you call Petra.

1123
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:47,352
She's used to it.

1124
01:25:47,440 --> 01:25:48,999
And if I die here,

1125
01:25:49,120 --> 01:25:51,680
which I hope doesn't happen
because I want to die in my bed,

1126
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:53,399
Maya and Mercedes will help you.

1127
01:25:53,480 --> 01:25:56,200
- Do we have to talk about this now?
- Yes.

1128
01:26:00,040 --> 01:26:01,474
On my head...

1129
01:26:06,200 --> 01:26:07,680
a half-circle <i>mantilla.</i>

1130
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:09,800
Because I'm a widow.

1131
01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:11,709
Let me help you.

1132
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:14,031
Come, I'll help you. Let's see.

1133
01:26:18,160 --> 01:26:19,160
There.

1134
01:26:19,240 --> 01:26:22,278
And the habit of Jesus of Medinaceli.

1135
01:26:22,360 --> 01:26:24,556
- With its cord.
- Right, with its cord.

1136
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:28,873
You put a rosary in my hands.

1137
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:31,716
This one, the old one.

1138
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:33,757
I want you to keep the new one.

1139
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:36,230
- Wouldn't you rather have the new one?
- No.

1140
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:40,436
I want to be barefoot.

1141
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:45,072
If they tie my feet to bury me, untie them
and tell them I asked you to do it.

1142
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:49,476
I want to be very light where I'm going.

1143
01:26:53,240 --> 01:26:54,913
Do you remember this pen?

1144
01:26:56,080 --> 01:26:58,754
- Of course.
- Your father gave it to me.

1145
01:26:58,840 --> 01:27:02,197
I wrote all my letters with it
when we were dating.

1146
01:27:02,320 --> 01:27:04,312
And the wooden egg, Mom?

1147
01:27:06,920 --> 01:27:09,754
I wonder how much I mended with this egg.

1148
01:27:09,840 --> 01:27:13,595
It's the least valuable thing in here.

1149
01:27:13,680 --> 01:27:15,000
Well, give it to me.

1150
01:27:17,240 --> 01:27:20,199
Here. You just inherited it.

1151
01:27:23,040 --> 01:27:24,599
I think about her a lot lately.

1152
01:27:26,600 --> 01:27:30,879
It's the first time I've heard you say
you haven't gotten over your mother's death.

1153
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:34,872
I think a lot about my childhood too.

1154
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:38,192
When I'm tossing and turning,
which is most of the time,

1155
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:42,354
I always end up thinking of my mother
when I was a child.

1156
01:27:42,440 --> 01:27:45,831
But you've never talked about her
or your childhood in your films.

1157
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:48,640
- My mother didn't like that.
- You think?

1158
01:27:50,280 --> 01:27:52,795
She told me one of the last times
she was at the hospital.

1159
01:27:54,440 --> 01:27:56,397
Your legs are so clean, Mom.

1160
01:27:58,040 --> 01:28:00,600
I got that from my family.

1161
01:28:00,680 --> 01:28:03,275
No one had varicose veins in my family.

1162
01:28:03,360 --> 01:28:04,555
It's a shame, son.

1163
01:28:06,480 --> 01:28:07,480
What's that?

1164
01:28:08,360 --> 01:28:11,432
You won't have a good old age.

1165
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:12,520
Why's that?

1166
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:15,397
You're like your father's family.

1167
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:21,156
Oh, Mom. The things you say.
Come on, tell me, how was your night?

1168
01:28:21,240 --> 01:28:22,833
So-so.

1169
01:28:22,920 --> 01:28:25,480
I spent all night with my neighbor Lola.

1170
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:29,636
Here, in the room?

1171
01:28:29,720 --> 01:28:32,679
Of course not. In my dreams.

1172
01:28:32,760 --> 01:28:34,831
I dreamt of her all night.

1173
01:28:36,680 --> 01:28:38,478
I had just arrived in the village,

1174
01:28:39,880 --> 01:28:42,839
and I heard Lola knocking
on the door as usual

1175
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:44,952
when she heard me arriving from Madrid.

1176
01:28:47,320 --> 01:28:49,198
Even though it was a dream,

1177
01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:51,590
I remembered Lola was dead.

1178
01:28:53,200 --> 01:28:55,396
But I opened the door.

1179
01:28:55,480 --> 01:28:59,156
And I found her the same as always,

1180
01:29:00,840 --> 01:29:03,230
even if she was a little translucent.

1181
01:29:04,640 --> 01:29:07,075
But I... I wasn't scared.

1182
01:29:07,160 --> 01:29:08,879
And I told her, "Lola,

1183
01:29:10,280 --> 01:29:12,033
I guess you're not okay

1184
01:29:13,240 --> 01:29:14,754
and you want me to do something.

1185
01:29:16,600 --> 01:29:20,355
But you need to tell me what
and I promise I'll do it."

1186
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:26,119
"No, Jacinta. I'm fine," she said.

1187
01:29:27,960 --> 01:29:30,350
"But how can you be fine?" I asked her.

1188
01:29:30,440 --> 01:29:33,274
"If you were fine, you wouldn't appear."

1189
01:29:33,360 --> 01:29:34,760
"I appear to you

1190
01:29:35,920 --> 01:29:38,151
because my daughters get very scared."

1191
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:42,835
"But how can you come to the village
when it's this cold?"

1192
01:29:42,920 --> 01:29:45,480
"I'm not cold or hot anymore,"

1193
01:29:47,560 --> 01:29:48,880
she answered.

1194
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:53,716
"And there's no place like home."

1195
01:29:56,080 --> 01:29:59,357
"You're completely right, my friend,"
I told her.

1196
01:30:04,960 --> 01:30:06,280
And what else?

1197
01:30:09,440 --> 01:30:12,672
Don't make that narrator's face, eh?

1198
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:15,713
No, no, no. I don't want you
to put any of this in your movies.

1199
01:30:15,800 --> 01:30:19,794
I don't want my neighbors to be in them,
I don't like autofiction.

1200
01:30:19,880 --> 01:30:22,031
What do you know about autofiction?

1201
01:30:22,120 --> 01:30:24,032
I heard you explaining it in an interview.

1202
01:30:25,240 --> 01:30:28,756
My neighbors don't like it
when you showcase them.

1203
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:32,514
They feel you treat them like hicks.

1204
01:30:32,600 --> 01:30:34,432
Mom, what are you saying?

1205
01:30:34,520 --> 01:30:37,479
I can't treat them
with more respect and devotion.

1206
01:30:39,240 --> 01:30:41,835
Every opportunity I have, I talk about you

1207
01:30:41,920 --> 01:30:46,039
and I say I was educated by you
and the neighbors.

1208
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:51,437
I owe everything to you.

1209
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:52,670
They don't like it.

1210
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:58,116
Let's go for a walk, you haven't moved yet.

1211
01:30:58,200 --> 01:31:00,136
I haven't moved
because I don't have anywhere to go.

1212
01:31:00,160 --> 01:31:02,470
- Now you have somewhere to go. Come on.
- Where?

1213
01:31:02,600 --> 01:31:03,600
To the hallway.

1214
01:31:13,720 --> 01:31:14,756
That's it.

1215
01:31:17,800 --> 01:31:19,951
You haven't been a good son, my son.

1216
01:31:21,680 --> 01:31:22,830
I haven't?

1217
01:31:22,920 --> 01:31:24,593
No.

1218
01:31:24,680 --> 01:31:27,718
You never forgave me for recommending you
to Paterna's lay sister.

1219
01:31:27,800 --> 01:31:29,678
And you took revenge for that.

1220
01:31:30,680 --> 01:31:33,991
I didn't want you to go
to the seminary either.

1221
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:35,560
But we were poor.

1222
01:31:35,640 --> 01:31:39,077
It's true I didn't want to go,
but to think I wanted to get revenge?

1223
01:31:39,160 --> 01:31:40,640
How can you think that?

1224
01:31:43,280 --> 01:31:47,274
After high school,
you couldn't wait to leave for Madrid.

1225
01:31:48,720 --> 01:31:50,279
And when your father died,

1226
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:55,036
I asked if you wanted me
to come live with you.

1227
01:31:55,120 --> 01:31:58,192
You dodged the question.

1228
01:31:58,280 --> 01:32:01,717
You said you had a lifestyle

1229
01:32:01,800 --> 01:32:04,235
that you couldn't share with me.

1230
01:32:04,320 --> 01:32:07,996
And it was true.
But not in the way you understood it.

1231
01:32:09,080 --> 01:32:11,640
I understood perfectly well.

1232
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:18,356
I have really bad legs,
but my head works perfectly well.

1233
01:32:18,440 --> 01:32:21,080
When I wasn't traveling, I was filming.

1234
01:32:21,160 --> 01:32:24,597
You wouldn't have endured the loneliness
of an apartment in Madrid.

1235
01:32:24,680 --> 01:32:26,717
That was no life for you.

1236
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:28,519
I would've taken care of you.

1237
01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:32,638
I would've adapted,
like I have adapted to so many things.

1238
01:32:34,480 --> 01:32:35,914
But you didn't want to.

1239
01:32:37,120 --> 01:32:38,474
And that hurt me.

1240
01:32:42,480 --> 01:32:43,480
Mom...

1241
01:32:44,960 --> 01:32:46,758
I'm very sorry

1242
01:32:46,840 --> 01:32:49,275
for not having been the kid you wanted.

1243
01:32:52,120 --> 01:32:53,349
When you used to say:

1244
01:32:54,360 --> 01:32:56,033
"Who does this kid take after?"

1245
01:32:57,520 --> 01:33:00,592
you didn't exactly say it with pride.

1246
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:04,520
And I was aware of that.

1247
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:17,474
Have I failed you
just by being the way I am?

1248
01:33:20,520 --> 01:33:21,636
I'm really sorry.

1249
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:28,832
Pass me St. Anthony.

1250
01:33:39,720 --> 01:33:41,518
Tonight, I'll pray for you.

1251
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:44,076
Thanks a lot.

1252
01:33:48,120 --> 01:33:50,237
- Salvador...
- Yes.

1253
01:33:50,320 --> 01:33:52,516
I brought you into this world,

1254
01:33:53,960 --> 01:33:57,112
and I did everything to raise you.

1255
01:33:57,200 --> 01:33:58,600
I know, Mom.

1256
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:04,360
Take me to the village.

1257
01:34:06,360 --> 01:34:08,158
This is my one and only wish.

1258
01:34:10,600 --> 01:34:11,600
All right.

1259
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:16,311
You and I will go to the village.

1260
01:34:17,720 --> 01:34:19,951
And Maya, to help around the house.

1261
01:34:20,720 --> 01:34:23,440
I'll take care of you day and night.

1262
01:34:23,520 --> 01:34:25,557
I won't fail you this time, Mom.

1263
01:34:37,640 --> 01:34:39,711
But I couldn't keep my promise.

1264
01:34:42,120 --> 01:34:44,476
I had to take her
to the hospital the next day.

1265
01:34:45,480 --> 01:34:47,358
You did everything you could.

1266
01:34:48,280 --> 01:34:49,280
Yeah.

1267
01:34:50,760 --> 01:34:52,956
But she wanted to die in the village.

1268
01:34:54,680 --> 01:34:56,990
And I had promised to take her.

1269
01:34:59,040 --> 01:35:02,477
The poor woman died in the hospital's ICU...

1270
01:35:04,320 --> 01:35:05,320
alone.

1271
01:35:08,040 --> 01:35:10,919
They're inviting you
to give a talk in Iceland. Well paid.

1272
01:35:12,400 --> 01:35:15,154
I don't understand
why they like me so much in Iceland.

1273
01:35:15,240 --> 01:35:16,240
Me neither.

1274
01:35:17,320 --> 01:35:19,880
And this one is from a small gallery.

1275
01:35:20,920 --> 01:35:22,991
But I didn't throw it away,
I like the drawing.

1276
01:35:30,760 --> 01:35:31,796
Salvador Mallo?

1277
01:35:32,360 --> 01:35:34,033
- Yes.
- You may come in.

1278
01:35:38,320 --> 01:35:40,198
Sit down here, slowly.

1279
01:35:43,440 --> 01:35:46,035
While I hold your legs,

1280
01:35:46,120 --> 01:35:48,157
you turn around and lie down.

1281
01:35:51,880 --> 01:35:53,234
Yes, thanks.

1282
01:36:32,960 --> 01:36:36,795
- Hey, when does your mother get back?
- At lunchtime.

1283
01:36:36,880 --> 01:36:39,156
When she goes sewing
at the lay sister's house,

1284
01:36:39,240 --> 01:36:40,879
she stays there all morning.

1285
01:36:54,920 --> 01:36:56,479
Let's see.

1286
01:36:56,560 --> 01:36:59,598
Let's see, Salvador. Don't move.

1287
01:36:59,680 --> 01:37:00,875
Stay there.

1288
01:37:07,440 --> 01:37:09,671
Can you hold the book with both hands?

1289
01:37:11,360 --> 01:37:12,360
Like that.

1290
01:37:37,200 --> 01:37:38,680
Okay, lift your head.

1291
01:37:53,120 --> 01:37:54,713
What do you think?

1292
01:37:54,800 --> 01:37:56,120
It's very pretty.

1293
01:37:56,200 --> 01:37:59,750
I still have to finish it.
I'll take it home and finish it.

1294
01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:00,840
Yeah.

1295
01:38:03,360 --> 01:38:06,637
Do you mind if I wash up? Look at me.

1296
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:09,713
Yeah, I'll go get the soap.

1297
01:38:22,840 --> 01:38:24,479
- Here.
- Thank you.

1298
01:39:31,640 --> 01:39:34,280
Salvador, would you bring me a towel?

1299
01:39:35,280 --> 01:39:36,680
I'm coming, Eduardo.

1300
01:40:07,840 --> 01:40:09,911
You're burning up.

1301
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:11,798
You probably got sunstroke.

1302
01:40:23,360 --> 01:40:25,477
Salvador, what happened?

1303
01:40:25,560 --> 01:40:27,358
He got too much sun.

1304
01:40:27,440 --> 01:40:29,397
I was reading.

1305
01:40:29,480 --> 01:40:32,040
But you didn't realize you were in the sun?

1306
01:40:32,120 --> 01:40:33,713
You're burning up!

1307
01:40:33,840 --> 01:40:36,594
- I didn't realize.
- And you?

1308
01:40:36,680 --> 01:40:38,876
I finished putting up the tiles.

1309
01:40:38,960 --> 01:40:42,237
And when he fainted, I brought him here.

1310
01:40:42,320 --> 01:40:43,674
You fainted?

1311
01:40:43,760 --> 01:40:46,150
A little. I lost my head.

1312
01:40:46,240 --> 01:40:47,435
Oh, my God.

1313
01:40:47,560 --> 01:40:49,916
Stay here. I'll get a rag with vinegar.

1314
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,071
And your father? At the bar?

1315
01:40:52,160 --> 01:40:53,160
Yes.

1316
01:40:54,920 --> 01:40:56,957
He told me he was staying home.

1317
01:41:02,760 --> 01:41:04,433
What's this bucket doing here?

1318
01:41:04,520 --> 01:41:06,273
I washed myself a little.

1319
01:41:06,360 --> 01:41:08,875
You could wait until you get to your house,
couldn't you?

1320
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:12,437
It's an effort for me
to carry the water all the way here.

1321
01:41:12,520 --> 01:41:13,715
I was very dirty.

1322
01:41:14,320 --> 01:41:16,232
Should I grab a bucket and wipe the floor?

1323
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:18,232
No, fetch the water, I'll wipe it.

1324
01:41:20,400 --> 01:41:22,119
The tiles look nice.

1325
01:41:24,680 --> 01:41:26,637
Yes, very nice. Thanks.

1326
01:41:28,600 --> 01:41:29,829
I'll get the water.

1327
01:41:50,120 --> 01:41:52,954
First of all, I want to reassure you,
there's no tumor.

1328
01:41:53,040 --> 01:41:55,475
We have completely ruled that out.

1329
01:41:55,560 --> 01:41:58,917
Okay, but something's wrong with me
because I even choke on puree.

1330
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:03,438
Yes, what happens to you, this dysphagia,
is due to the Forestier syndrome.

1331
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:05,113
You'll see it more clearly here.

1332
01:42:07,400 --> 01:42:09,357
You see this white part
next to the vertebra?

1333
01:42:09,440 --> 01:42:11,193
It's an osteophyte.

1334
01:42:11,280 --> 01:42:13,192
An ossification.

1335
01:42:13,280 --> 01:42:16,990
Here, you can see the esophagus displaced
by this ossification.

1336
01:42:17,080 --> 01:42:21,040
There's barely any space for food
to pass through, even liquids.

1337
01:42:21,120 --> 01:42:23,351
That's why you're choking.

1338
01:42:23,440 --> 01:42:25,397
Why has that bone grown so much there?

1339
01:42:26,400 --> 01:42:30,713
Forestier syndrome is a rare illness,
and we don't know what causes it.

1340
01:42:30,800 --> 01:42:35,636
We know it affects tendons,
ligaments and joint capsules that calcify,

1341
01:42:35,720 --> 01:42:37,393
but we don't know why.

1342
01:42:37,480 --> 01:42:41,315
In your case, the anterior ligament
of the cervical spine was calcified.

1343
01:42:42,760 --> 01:42:44,592
- Is there anything you can do?
- Surgery.

1344
01:42:44,720 --> 01:42:47,076
We need to remove that calcification
as soon as possible.

1345
01:42:48,640 --> 01:42:51,872
But don't worry. It's not a risky surgery.

1346
01:42:52,800 --> 01:42:55,952
The gastroenterologist and your surgeon
will give you more information.

1347
01:42:56,040 --> 01:42:57,918
- All right.
- Thank you.

1348
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,993
POPULAR ART

1349
01:43:18,400 --> 01:43:19,400
Hello.

1350
01:43:21,200 --> 01:43:23,556
Are you interested in the watercolor?

1351
01:43:23,640 --> 01:43:26,553
Yes, I'd like to buy it. Who's the author?

1352
01:43:26,640 --> 01:43:30,316
It's anonymous.
Almost all the pieces have no signature.

1353
01:43:32,240 --> 01:43:33,469
How did it get here?

1354
01:43:33,600 --> 01:43:36,718
I bought it in the Encants market
in Barcelona.

1355
01:43:36,800 --> 01:43:38,632
It's one of my favorite pieces.

1356
01:43:39,680 --> 01:43:41,911
So you have no idea who painted it?

1357
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,560
There's something written on the back.

1358
01:43:46,560 --> 01:43:51,919
But these are all anonymous artists that
probably don't even know they're artists.

1359
01:43:55,160 --> 01:43:58,278
<i>Dear Salvador, I'm sending
the drawing to your house</i>

1360
01:43:58,360 --> 01:44:01,353
<i>because I don't have the school's address.</i>

1361
01:44:01,440 --> 01:44:03,830
<i>I'm happy I'm able to write to you.</i>

1362
01:44:03,920 --> 01:44:07,357
<i>You taught me how to write,
and I'm very grateful.</i>

1363
01:44:07,440 --> 01:44:10,274
<i>I'm working at Conchita's uncle's store,</i>

1364
01:44:10,360 --> 01:44:14,070
<i>and I'm good with numbers,
all thanks to you.</i>

1365
01:44:14,160 --> 01:44:17,392
<i>I have a good life here,
but I miss life in the caves</i>

1366
01:44:17,520 --> 01:44:19,637
<i>and especially you.</i>

1367
01:44:19,720 --> 01:44:23,396
<i>Every time I write,
I think about your hand guiding mine.</i>

1368
01:44:23,480 --> 01:44:25,711
<i>I'm sure you're learning a lot at school,</i>

1369
01:44:25,800 --> 01:44:28,793
<i>reading lots of books
and watching lots of movies.</i>

1370
01:44:28,880 --> 01:44:32,840
<i>Here is my address in Bilbao,
so you can write and tell me how you are.</i>

1371
01:44:33,360 --> 01:44:35,477
<i>Your student, Eduardo.</i>

1372
01:45:21,880 --> 01:45:25,317
Salvador.
You have to get dressed in half an hour.

1373
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:27,433
Let me know a little bit before.

1374
01:45:36,880 --> 01:45:43,798
THE FIRST DESIRE

1375
01:45:50,520 --> 01:45:52,591
What do you think happened with the drawing?

1376
01:45:55,840 --> 01:45:57,559
Eduardo sent it to Paterna,

1377
01:45:58,240 --> 01:45:59,833
my mother probably received it.

1378
01:46:00,840 --> 01:46:03,639
I was already at the seminary.

1379
01:46:03,720 --> 01:46:06,076
She didn't send it or tell me about it.

1380
01:46:08,960 --> 01:46:10,440
Will you try to find him?

1381
01:46:12,040 --> 01:46:13,599
Eduardo?

1382
01:46:13,720 --> 01:46:16,713
It's easier with Google now.
Or going to Paterna and asking about him.

1383
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:18,234
Fifty years later?

1384
01:46:20,920 --> 01:46:23,310
It's a good plot for a story,

1385
01:46:23,400 --> 01:46:24,914
and I may write it,

1386
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:26,912
but it'd be crazy to look for him.

1387
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,216
I wonder how the drawing ended up
in Barcelona's flea market.

1388
01:46:29,240 --> 01:46:30,754
I have no idea.

1389
01:46:30,840 --> 01:46:32,069
By chance.

1390
01:46:34,840 --> 01:46:37,674
What matters is that the drawing made it
to the recipient.

1391
01:46:52,240 --> 01:46:53,993
Salvador, what's up?

1392
01:46:56,280 --> 01:46:59,432
We're going to switch beds,
little by little.

1393
01:47:01,720 --> 01:47:02,720
Stay still.

1394
01:47:04,200 --> 01:47:06,510
- Very good, your head goes here.
- Yes.

1395
01:47:17,120 --> 01:47:20,431
- I have to open this up a little, okay?
- Okay.

1396
01:47:20,520 --> 01:47:22,830
And I'm gonna put some stickers
on your chest.

1397
01:47:39,120 --> 01:47:40,120
How are you, Salvador?

1398
01:47:41,600 --> 01:47:42,954
Hello, doctor.

1399
01:47:43,040 --> 01:47:46,477
I heard about it.
No wonder you couldn't swallow.

1400
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:48,836
But don't worry, okay?
We'll take it out right away.

1401
01:47:50,920 --> 01:47:53,037
- Doctor.
- Talk to me.

1402
01:47:53,120 --> 01:47:55,954
- I'm writing again.
- Oh, really? Great news.

1403
01:47:56,040 --> 01:47:57,040
Yeah.

1404
01:47:57,120 --> 01:47:58,793
I'm really glad, Salvador.

1405
01:47:58,880 --> 01:48:00,872
And what is it? A drama or comedy?

1406
01:48:01,480 --> 01:48:02,994
I don't know.

1407
01:48:03,120 --> 01:48:04,634
You don't know that.

1408
01:48:22,600 --> 01:48:23,600
Mom?

1409
01:48:25,320 --> 01:48:28,154
Do you think there's a movie theater
in Paterna?

1410
01:48:30,760 --> 01:48:33,958
I'll settle for a house, son.

1411
01:48:53,160 --> 01:48:56,039
Cut.

1412
01:48:57,800 --> 01:49:00,634
Thirty-eight, five, first, final take.
