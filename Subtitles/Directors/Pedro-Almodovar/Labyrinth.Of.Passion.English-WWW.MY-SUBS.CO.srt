00:00:41,172 --> 00:00:45,052
LABYRINTH OF PASSION

2
00:01:13,212 --> 00:01:15,772
"A Spanish biogynaecologist,
Dr De la Pena,"

3
00:01:15,852 --> 00:01:20,532
"achieved the non-sexual reproduction of
six identical parakeets for the first time."

4
00:01:20,652 --> 00:01:24,172
"We are one step away
from the mass production of mammals."

5
00:01:25,612 --> 00:01:30,132
"The Emperor of Tiran leaves USA
and seeks refuge on Contadora Island."

6
00:01:32,812 --> 00:01:37,812
No money, babe, no car, no girl,
no hash, no vice, no mascara.

7
00:01:37,932 --> 00:01:39,452
I'm hysterical.

8
00:01:40,212 --> 00:01:44,492
"International porn star
Patti Diphusa talks about men."

9
00:01:45,412 --> 00:01:49,092
I'm going to snort a bit of nail polish.

10
00:01:56,012 --> 00:01:57,612
Take some, love.

11
00:01:58,972 --> 00:02:00,612
What an overdose!

12
00:02:07,092 --> 00:02:08,932
I love it. Here.

13
00:02:14,732 --> 00:02:18,332
- What a syndrome.
- What a syndrome. Loads of alcohol.

14
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,412
What an overdose!

15
00:02:33,492 --> 00:02:35,692
Pass me the lipstick, darling.

16
00:02:51,652 --> 00:02:53,092
Waiter!

17
00:02:55,852 --> 00:02:58,372
- How may I help you?
- Could you give this note

18
00:02:58,492 --> 00:03:01,092
- to that man over there?
- And who will pay for it?

19
00:03:01,172 --> 00:03:03,092
He will, of course.

20
00:03:06,892 --> 00:03:09,012
You have a note from that table.

21
00:03:09,132 --> 00:03:10,872
- Which one?
- That, the one on the back.

22
00:03:12,212 --> 00:03:13,892
It's 200 pesetas.

23
00:03:20,412 --> 00:03:24,572
"Yes, I'd like to Cher something
with you this evening."

24
00:03:25,412 --> 00:03:31,052
Hi, everyone. I'm back,
but I'm not here for you.

25
00:03:36,092 --> 00:03:37,372
- Hi.
- Hi.

26
00:03:37,452 --> 00:03:41,052
- What are you doing here?
- I'm on the pull, as you can see.

27
00:03:41,452 --> 00:03:43,572
What a coincidence. Me too.

28
00:03:44,012 --> 00:03:48,252
- Do you have a place?
- I have a 200-square-foot flat.

29
00:03:48,532 --> 00:03:51,412
- Do you think it'll be enough?
- More than enough.

30
00:03:51,492 --> 00:03:53,932
There's never enough.

31
00:03:54,372 --> 00:03:56,572
Size does matter.

32
00:04:02,452 --> 00:04:05,132
- Let's go home.
- Are you feeling lonely?

33
00:04:05,212 --> 00:04:10,132
No, but I want to throw a party.
There'll be music, alcohol, porn, drugs...

34
00:04:10,252 --> 00:04:12,852
- Hard ones, right?
- Only stimulants.

35
00:04:12,932 --> 00:04:15,292
- And what other girls will be there?
- It's just me.

36
00:04:15,412 --> 00:04:17,532
- Will it be enough?
- What do you think?

37
00:04:17,652 --> 00:04:21,252
And don't go away, there are
12 guys I like in there. Don't go away.

38
00:04:21,332 --> 00:04:22,812
Fast, we have an itch to scratch.

39
00:04:27,052 --> 00:04:30,092
What do you want to bet
I can catch it with my mouth?

40
00:04:30,172 --> 00:04:31,212
I don't know.

41
00:04:31,292 --> 00:04:33,972
- Don't you like betting?
- I can take it or leave it.

42
00:04:35,932 --> 00:04:37,332
I lost!

43
00:04:39,892 --> 00:04:41,692
See if I'm lucky with this one.

44
00:04:43,412 --> 00:04:47,772
Apart from men,
gambling is what excites me the most.

45
00:04:47,932 --> 00:04:49,972
I love betting on anything.

46
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:55,372
- And eating as well, right?
- Yes, but it doesn't excite me so much.

47
00:04:55,452 --> 00:04:57,172
At least not sexually.

48
00:04:57,892 --> 00:05:00,612
By the way, did you go out as we agreed?

49
00:05:00,692 --> 00:05:03,301
- Yes, I went to the flea market yesterday.
- And how was it?

50
00:05:03,652 --> 00:05:05,932
- Not bad at all.
- Did you buy anything?

51
00:05:06,052 --> 00:05:09,172
No. I found a few guys,
but I took them home for free.

52
00:05:09,252 --> 00:05:11,372
I don't need to pay for that yet.

53
00:05:11,452 --> 00:05:15,372
Are you implying that
you had sex with them?

54
00:05:15,772 --> 00:05:18,732
- Of course.
- And how many of them were there?

55
00:05:20,212 --> 00:05:22,652
Eight or 10. I didn't count them.

56
00:05:22,732 --> 00:05:24,772
- And how many girls?
- Just me.

57
00:05:24,852 --> 00:05:27,692
I never take girls to my parties.
I can manage myself.

58
00:05:27,812 --> 00:05:31,892
- But, Sexi, that means you're a...
- Nymphomaniac?

59
00:05:31,972 --> 00:05:33,988
- Since I was a child.
- But you should control yourself.

60
00:05:34,012 --> 00:05:35,212
Why?

61
00:05:35,932 --> 00:05:40,252
Because you won't always be young. I'm
talking from experience. And it's not fair.

62
00:05:40,332 --> 00:05:42,852
Even if it sounds like a cliche,
it's your father's fault.

63
00:05:42,932 --> 00:05:45,692
- My father's?
- Let me explain.

64
00:05:46,252 --> 00:05:49,252
You hate the sun
because it represents him to you.

65
00:05:49,332 --> 00:05:52,412
Because you're very much in love with him.

66
00:05:52,492 --> 00:05:56,972
And you shag anything that moves just to
see if he reacts and pays attention to you.

67
00:05:57,052 --> 00:05:59,892
But your father is completely blind.

68
00:06:00,012 --> 00:06:02,892
He doesn't realise
that your happiness depends on him.

69
00:06:02,972 --> 00:06:05,092
Your happiness and mine.

70
00:06:05,372 --> 00:06:09,612
Not my happiness, I can tell you that.
But why does yours depend on him?

71
00:06:09,692 --> 00:06:13,812
Why hide it from you? I
want to shag your dad.

72
00:06:15,052 --> 00:06:17,932
- My dad?
- Professional success isn't everything.

73
00:06:18,172 --> 00:06:19,892
I'm going to call him.

74
00:06:25,932 --> 00:06:27,372
I'm sorry, Princess.

75
00:06:28,372 --> 00:06:30,732
Yes? Yes, put me through.

76
00:06:31,132 --> 00:06:33,092
Hello? It's Susana.

77
00:06:33,172 --> 00:06:36,532
- Hello, Susana. Did Sexilia pass by?
- Yes, I'm here with her.

78
00:06:36,612 --> 00:06:40,852
But you never told me she's been
a nymphomaniac since she was a child.

79
00:06:40,932 --> 00:06:43,212
I don't know, I must have forgotten.

80
00:06:44,052 --> 00:06:49,292
You really are a case.
Why don't you and I have dinner tonight?

81
00:06:49,372 --> 00:06:51,732
- I can't. Not tonight.
- All right, tomorrow.

82
00:06:51,812 --> 00:06:54,412
- Tomorrow I can't, either.
- The day after?

83
00:06:54,532 --> 00:06:56,892
- No, I can't this week.
- Well, next week.

84
00:06:57,092 --> 00:07:00,452
I'll call you and we'll talk, all right?
Goodbye, Susana.

85
00:07:01,652 --> 00:07:03,412
I'm sorry, Princess.

86
00:07:04,012 --> 00:07:05,212
Is something wrong?

87
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:07,732
It was Sexilia's psychologist.
She's a bit of a pain.

88
00:07:07,812 --> 00:07:10,572
I didn't know she was under treatment.
Is it serious?

89
00:07:10,652 --> 00:07:13,732
It's nothing. But the
other day at a party...

90
00:07:14,092 --> 00:07:16,372
Who's this man?

91
00:07:16,892 --> 00:07:20,572
Don't you know him?
He's Dr De la Pena, the biogynaecologist.

92
00:07:20,652 --> 00:07:23,212
- The father of artificial insemination?
- Yes.

93
00:07:23,892 --> 00:07:26,172
I didn't think he was that young.

94
00:07:26,292 --> 00:07:29,972
- Ana, I think I like him.
- Well, forget it.

95
00:07:30,052 --> 00:07:32,652
He's the kind of man
who's married to his job.

96
00:07:32,732 --> 00:07:37,292
In his case, that means being sexually
obsessed. I'm going to get off with him.

97
00:07:38,652 --> 00:07:40,452
You won't succeed.

98
00:07:40,532 --> 00:07:44,132
- Do you want to bet?
- Your fur coat.

99
00:07:44,212 --> 00:07:46,772
- Against your Sevres porcelain.
- Deal.

100
00:07:47,052 --> 00:07:50,412
- And how is Sexilia?
- I don't know. I barely see her.

101
00:07:50,492 --> 00:07:54,972
- Why? Does she go out a lot at night?
- No, but she leaves her room at 5:00,

102
00:07:55,052 --> 00:07:58,732
and I start working at that time,
so we don't see each other.

103
00:07:58,852 --> 00:08:03,292
Sexi has an aversion to daylight.

104
00:08:03,372 --> 00:08:04,492
How come?

105
00:08:04,612 --> 00:08:09,532
She just hates it. She had to take
night lessons at secondary school...

106
00:08:09,652 --> 00:08:13,252
There is a name for that in
psychopathology. My name is Susana Diaz.

107
00:08:13,332 --> 00:08:15,972
- Pleased to meet you.
- I'm a Lacanian psychoanalyst.

108
00:08:16,052 --> 00:08:18,172
- I see.
- Why don't you bring her to my office?

109
00:08:18,292 --> 00:08:19,428
- My name is Ana.
- Pleased to meet you.

110
00:08:19,452 --> 00:08:24,452
I could make her overcome
her little phobia of daylight.

111
00:08:24,852 --> 00:08:30,052
I told Sexilia and she found it amusing.
Going to therapy is trendy among the youth.

112
00:08:30,332 --> 00:08:33,092
She's been going there for a week,

113
00:08:33,172 --> 00:08:37,092
and it would be great if she could
overcome her phobia for daylight.

114
00:08:37,172 --> 00:08:39,892
- It must be very uncomfortable.
- Yes.

115
00:08:44,092 --> 00:08:46,292
- Here is what you asked for.
- Thanks.

116
00:08:46,372 --> 00:08:48,412
- Anything else?
- No, thanks.

117
00:08:49,452 --> 00:08:54,212
And, back to our business, are you happy?

118
00:08:54,612 --> 00:08:59,532
- Well, imagine. It seems incredible.
- But it's true.

119
00:08:59,652 --> 00:09:03,412
You're more fertile now
than a 15-year-old girl.

120
00:09:03,972 --> 00:09:06,332
We've done a great job, Princess.

121
00:09:07,092 --> 00:09:09,132
Will you tell the Emperor?

122
00:09:10,652 --> 00:09:12,092
I don't know.

123
00:09:12,532 --> 00:09:16,532
Between exile, his cancer...

124
00:09:17,092 --> 00:09:21,772
- It must be hard for him.
- Yes, it must be very hard for him.

125
00:09:22,892 --> 00:09:25,572
- Have I told you that I met him?
- No.

126
00:09:25,772 --> 00:09:29,212
It was one summer 15 years ago
on the Costa del Sol.

127
00:09:29,332 --> 00:09:31,892
He was with Sarah and the children.

128
00:09:31,972 --> 00:09:35,412
You know he was very
interested in gynaecology.

129
00:09:35,732 --> 00:09:37,052
You're telling me.

130
00:09:37,532 --> 00:09:41,132
Well, I had published an article
on artificial insemination

131
00:09:41,212 --> 00:09:46,052
that caused a huge stir,
and he happened to read it.

132
00:09:46,372 --> 00:09:51,972
He learned that I spent my summers there,
called me, and we had a very nice chat.

133
00:09:52,332 --> 00:09:57,892
He told me to call him if I continued
with my research. He had an idea.

134
00:09:58,212 --> 00:10:04,132
- What idea?
- He wanted to have many children.

135
00:10:04,452 --> 00:10:07,052
He wanted half his
country to carry his blood,

136
00:10:07,172 --> 00:10:11,452
and he thought that
my theories would make it possible.

137
00:10:13,452 --> 00:10:19,692
Yes, he's a bit crazy.
And when he left me, he went even crazier.

138
00:10:20,012 --> 00:10:21,652
Yes, I suppose.

139
00:10:21,732 --> 00:10:25,412
The doctor will help you have your
own child. I'm talking from experience.

140
00:10:25,492 --> 00:10:29,492
- I was hopeless, too.
- But you're a bit younger than me.

141
00:10:29,572 --> 00:10:34,332
Never mind. I was totally sterile,
and I have the womb of a six-year-old girl.

142
00:10:34,452 --> 00:10:35,852
It's incredible.

143
00:10:36,252 --> 00:10:38,644
So this must all seem
like a miracle to you, doesn't it?

144
00:10:38,732 --> 00:10:43,732
Well, you can see. But you
should think it over before doing it.

145
00:10:44,212 --> 00:10:46,492
Children don't bring happiness.

146
00:10:46,692 --> 00:10:50,612
And we shouldn't fight against nature.
She knows much more than we do.

147
00:10:51,052 --> 00:10:56,892
- Now I regret taking this step.
- How can you say so, with such a beautiful child?

148
00:10:57,092 --> 00:11:00,452
- She's going to kill me.
- Don't say that in front of her.

149
00:11:00,532 --> 00:11:04,812
- She doesn't mind. She's used to it.
- Mum exaggerates a lot, doesn't she?

150
00:11:04,892 --> 00:11:08,812
- She has bad nerves.
- She's so impudent!

151
00:11:10,372 --> 00:11:12,652
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon, Doctor.

152
00:11:12,932 --> 00:11:17,332
- Hello, Carmen. What are you reading?
- Come on, don't be rude.

153
00:11:17,412 --> 00:11:19,692
- Answer the doctor.
- I don't want to.

154
00:11:20,092 --> 00:11:25,012
- Is this the test-tube child? Oh, I'm sorry.
- No, don't worry, I'm used to it by now.

155
00:11:25,492 --> 00:11:29,252
Forgive me for asking,
but I'm thinking of doing it, too.

156
00:11:29,372 --> 00:11:32,892
- Me, too.
- It's wonderful, isn't it?

157
00:11:33,252 --> 00:11:35,012
You don't know what you're getting into.

158
00:11:35,092 --> 00:11:38,932
- Is she completely normal?
- Yes, I guess so.

159
00:11:39,012 --> 00:11:42,012
- But she's a monster.
- My God, don't say that.

160
00:11:42,532 --> 00:11:45,332
- She's so smart.
- No, she's not an idiot,

161
00:11:45,412 --> 00:11:48,932
- but I'm fed up with her.
- Don't exaggerate.

162
00:11:49,052 --> 00:11:52,932
It sometimes happens to children.
You know, they're just children.

163
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:55,572
And a mother must be patient.

164
00:11:55,732 --> 00:11:58,812
- Of course. We'd be very patient.
- I see.

165
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:01,572
- That's what we're here for.
- Goodbye.

166
00:12:01,652 --> 00:12:03,332
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

167
00:12:04,532 --> 00:12:07,612
- If I only told you...
- Get it off your chest. You can tell me.

168
00:12:07,692 --> 00:12:12,772
I used to live with a man who
wanted to have a child, but I was sterile.

169
00:12:12,852 --> 00:12:14,892
Then we found this solution.

170
00:12:15,012 --> 00:12:18,092
Do you know what he did
when I came home with the child? He left.

171
00:12:18,172 --> 00:12:22,092
- What a rotten swine.
- And now I'm alone with her.

172
00:12:22,412 --> 00:12:24,532
You just need to find another man.

173
00:12:24,612 --> 00:12:26,892
But when?
I spend my days working at the airport.

174
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:31,852
There are opportunities there, people
coming and going. And there are loads of men

175
00:12:31,972 --> 00:12:33,612
who like test-tube children.

176
00:12:38,332 --> 00:12:41,692
- Hi, Sexilia, how are you?
- Great.

177
00:12:41,812 --> 00:12:45,892
- Do you know I'm fertile thanks to your dad?
- Fertile? What for?

178
00:12:46,812 --> 00:12:48,572
I'm sorry, Princess.

179
00:12:48,652 --> 00:12:50,612
- I'm really sorry.
- Don't worry.

180
00:12:50,692 --> 00:12:54,972
- I understand. She's not very well, the poor child.
- I have a problem with her.

181
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:59,732
Call me if there is any news.
Have a good trip, Princess.

182
00:13:04,212 --> 00:13:05,692
Come in.

183
00:13:09,852 --> 00:13:14,612
- Sexi, why did you talk like that to the empress?
- Former empress, you mean.

184
00:13:15,052 --> 00:13:17,492
She's always kind to you.

185
00:13:17,572 --> 00:13:22,332
- I don't like her. I never have, and I can't hide it.
- I see.

186
00:13:24,532 --> 00:13:29,012
- How did it go with your psychologist?
- Very well. She's funny, she's very crazy.

187
00:13:29,092 --> 00:13:31,732
- She's said to be very good.
- I don't know.

188
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:33,772
- At least she's original.
- I see.

189
00:13:33,852 --> 00:13:37,092
- I have to leave you, I must go back to work.
- Bye.

190
00:13:58,492 --> 00:14:03,332
"Vitopens. Gives your penis
long-lasting strength and hardness."

191
00:14:03,452 --> 00:14:08,292
"Especially indicated for mature,
impotent men and those lacking libido."

192
00:14:18,492 --> 00:14:20,132
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

193
00:14:20,212 --> 00:14:21,772
It's all this.

194
00:14:27,612 --> 00:14:29,092
A coat,

195
00:14:31,812 --> 00:14:33,772
a pair of blue trousers,

196
00:14:36,972 --> 00:14:38,732
a leather jacket

197
00:14:42,212 --> 00:14:44,252
and a short dress.

198
00:14:47,612 --> 00:14:50,812
- Is it urgent?
- A bit.

199
00:14:54,172 --> 00:14:57,692
Well, it's impossible

200
00:14:59,052 --> 00:15:00,868
- in less than five days.
- All right. Goodbye.

201
00:15:00,892 --> 00:15:02,852
Goodbye. Thanks.

202
00:15:20,172 --> 00:15:21,972
You are divine.

203
00:15:25,892 --> 00:15:28,692
Queti, go buy my tea.

204
00:15:28,972 --> 00:15:33,412
- Bladderwrack tea. Don't forget.
- I'll go right now.

205
00:15:40,972 --> 00:15:42,732
- Queti?
- Yes?

206
00:15:42,972 --> 00:15:44,612
Bring me my tea.

207
00:16:00,452 --> 00:16:03,052
"Benzamuro. Calms sexual desire."

208
00:16:03,132 --> 00:16:08,292
"Neutralises sexual energy
of strong animals in heat."

209
00:16:15,372 --> 00:16:17,332
Dad, here's your tea.

210
00:16:36,532 --> 00:16:38,572
- Darling?
- Yes?

211
00:16:39,012 --> 00:16:44,092
- Can you put some cream on my back?
- Yes, I'll do it right now.

212
00:16:46,612 --> 00:16:50,372
Turn around a little, please.

213
00:16:53,452 --> 00:16:57,452
That's it. Slowly. Softly.

214
00:16:58,412 --> 00:17:01,492
- Here.
- Here?

215
00:17:06,132 --> 00:17:07,252
Look.

216
00:17:08,332 --> 00:17:12,452
It's a pity these wrinkles aren't
like the ones on trousers.

217
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:16,132
I wish I could iron them out.

218
00:17:19,092 --> 00:17:22,172
- What do you do to look so young?
- Nothing.

219
00:17:22,892 --> 00:17:27,972
- Nothing? You always say that.
- You always ask that.

220
00:17:28,652 --> 00:17:31,372
And you're only two years younger than me.

221
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:37,372
- Don't start again, Dad, please.
- Don't call me Dad.

222
00:17:37,452 --> 00:17:42,052
- I've told you not to call me Dad.
- What's up? Same story all over again?

223
00:17:45,572 --> 00:17:48,132
This is not right. It's not right, Dad.

224
00:17:48,212 --> 00:17:50,972
- This is not right.
- Either you're schizophrenic

225
00:17:51,452 --> 00:17:54,492
or you do it to turn me on. Come here.

226
00:17:57,132 --> 00:18:00,132
- Let's go to bed.
- No, I have a lot to do. I have to do laundry.

227
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:02,492
I have to do the ironing,
and there's lots of it.

228
00:18:02,612 --> 00:18:07,052
- I'll help you out later...
- This is very wrong, Dad.

229
00:18:11,492 --> 00:18:15,172
You like it this way,
don't you? You're debauched.

230
00:18:16,652 --> 00:18:20,972
I married a woman who, on top of having
a dual personality, is a bit debauched.

231
00:18:24,252 --> 00:18:28,012
But I love you the same
when you say you're my daughter

232
00:18:28,092 --> 00:18:30,212
and when you say you're my wife.

233
00:18:31,172 --> 00:18:36,852
If instead of two personalities you had
four, I'd love each and every one of them.

234
00:18:41,252 --> 00:18:44,372
"The son of the Emperor of Tiran
exiled in Madrid."

235
00:19:03,692 --> 00:19:05,012
- Hello.
- Hello.

236
00:19:05,092 --> 00:19:08,292
Could I speak to Mohamed? This is his aunt.

237
00:19:08,372 --> 00:19:11,212
- What are you doing? Are you alone?
- Not anymore.

238
00:19:12,932 --> 00:19:16,932
- Do you have a place?
- No. I live in a hotel, but I don't want to go there.

239
00:19:17,012 --> 00:19:22,212
- Mohamed, I'm fertile.
- At last! I knewyou'd succeed.

240
00:19:22,732 --> 00:19:27,812
- Well, I live with a few friends and...
- We'll do a group session.

241
00:19:29,172 --> 00:19:31,452
- No, no, no.
- They're not gay?

242
00:19:31,532 --> 00:19:36,132
- No, we're medical students.
- Okay, I'll just go with you, then.

243
00:19:36,452 --> 00:19:41,532
By the way, I need you to do me
a very special favour.

244
00:19:41,612 --> 00:19:47,772
I need a bit of the Emperor's semen.
I'll tell you how to send it to me.

245
00:19:48,412 --> 00:19:49,772
Come with me.

246
00:19:50,212 --> 00:19:52,732
Is it true Riza is in Madrid?

247
00:19:52,812 --> 00:19:57,652
Yes, I want to meet him. This is the coolest
city in the world, and he's so modern...

248
00:19:58,772 --> 00:20:00,732
- Do you have his address?
- No.

249
00:20:01,452 --> 00:20:08,332
I'd really like to see him. You have to
find out where he is, how I can find him.

250
00:20:08,572 --> 00:20:12,772
Look in the bathhouses,
in gay bars. Well, you know.

251
00:20:14,092 --> 00:20:18,012
I can't talk, somebody's coming.
This place is full of spies.

252
00:20:26,412 --> 00:20:27,532
Go on.

253
00:20:31,692 --> 00:20:34,892
It's a bit messy here.
We'd better go to my room.

254
00:20:50,852 --> 00:20:54,972
I really like you. It's been a long time
since I liked somebody so much.

255
00:21:26,812 --> 00:21:28,452
You smell so good.

256
00:21:29,892 --> 00:21:31,532
And that picture?

257
00:21:33,452 --> 00:21:38,052
That's me. It was at a party.
I dressed up like the women of my country.

258
00:21:39,692 --> 00:21:42,052
- Are you from Tiran?
- Yes.

259
00:21:43,092 --> 00:21:48,212
- And you? You look Arab, too.
- I'm English, but my mum is from Morocco.

260
00:21:52,492 --> 00:21:56,092
- Are you leaving already?
- I forgot I had things to do.

261
00:21:59,092 --> 00:22:02,092
- Wouldn't you like a repeat?
- I'm sorry, but I'm in a hurry.

262
00:22:02,732 --> 00:22:06,172
Well, give me a telephone number,
some way to contact you.

263
00:22:06,412 --> 00:22:08,452
I can't remember right now.

264
00:22:11,932 --> 00:22:14,132
- Besides, your friends are here.
- Well...

265
00:22:14,492 --> 00:22:17,572
Can you imagine
if what the magazines say were true?

266
00:22:17,732 --> 00:22:21,412
If that's the case,
we'll have to plan it carefully.

267
00:22:28,372 --> 00:22:30,412
- Sadec.
- Wow.

268
00:22:30,652 --> 00:22:32,292
- Sadec.
- What's going on?

269
00:22:36,972 --> 00:22:42,212
Sadec, how dare you bring someone here?
He could have seen the guns.

270
00:22:42,292 --> 00:22:45,212
- I'm sorry.
- Riza Niro is in Madrid.

271
00:22:46,412 --> 00:22:48,932
- Really?
- We thought we could kidnap him.

272
00:22:49,012 --> 00:22:53,132
Of course. Then his father will have to
give us back what he stole from us.

273
00:22:53,212 --> 00:22:55,332
- But do you have his address?
- No.

274
00:22:55,492 --> 00:22:59,852
- You'll have to use your sense of smell.
- But I'd need to smell his clothes first.

275
00:22:59,932 --> 00:23:03,372
That's fine. We'll ask our spy
in Contadora to send us something.

276
00:23:03,892 --> 00:23:08,252
- Let him send us his address. It'll be easier.
- I don't think he can. They're watching him.

277
00:23:08,412 --> 00:23:10,412
They might send us a piece of clothing.

278
00:23:14,172 --> 00:23:18,052
Enjoy, enjoy. Enjoy it more. Look at me.
Look at me with lewd eyes.

279
00:23:18,132 --> 00:23:20,572
Look at me. Get closer.
Get closer to the drill.

280
00:23:21,132 --> 00:23:25,132
You want that drill. Yes, try to lick it.

281
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:28,852
Try. Yes,
yes. You like it. You like the taste of it.

282
00:23:29,172 --> 00:23:31,228
- Fine. You're getting the drill, right, Pablo?
- Perfect.

283
00:23:31,252 --> 00:23:35,412
- Yes? Very good. Now, come a little.
- No! No!

284
00:23:35,492 --> 00:23:39,012
- Yes, yes, yes. Very good.
- Yes, yes! Yes!

285
00:23:39,092 --> 00:23:41,068
- I want more. I deserve it. Say "I deserve it".
- I deserve it.

286
00:23:41,092 --> 00:23:43,012
- I deserve it.
- More.

287
00:23:43,092 --> 00:23:45,292
- Shout, "I'm terrible".
- I'm terrible!

288
00:23:45,372 --> 00:23:47,252
- Terrible.
- I'm terrible, perverted!

289
00:23:47,332 --> 00:23:50,292
- Very good.
- Destroy me!

290
00:23:50,372 --> 00:23:54,692
Fabio, now phone and ask permission.
Phone a friend.

291
00:23:54,772 --> 00:23:57,372
- All right.
- But make it short.

292
00:23:57,452 --> 00:23:59,708
- Make it short, and watch what you say.
- Hi, So-and-so.

293
00:23:59,732 --> 00:24:03,012
So-and-so calls you.
She wants to talk and take you

294
00:24:03,132 --> 00:24:07,572
to some tacky bar to have salad for lunch.

295
00:24:07,652 --> 00:24:10,572
Or better yet, a tuna empanada.
And then you say,

296
00:24:10,652 --> 00:24:15,252
"Darling, I have to hang up. A sadistic
killer is literally tearing me apart."

297
00:24:15,332 --> 00:24:19,012
"If I survive, I'll call you
back and give you the details."

298
00:24:19,092 --> 00:24:21,068
Something like that,
but always posing for the camera.

299
00:24:21,092 --> 00:24:25,052
Darling, I have to hang up. A sadistic
killer is literally tearing me apart,

300
00:24:25,132 --> 00:24:30,532
- and I have to wait for him to finish.
- "Well, if I survive..."

301
00:24:30,612 --> 00:24:33,452
- If I survive...
- Open, open there.

302
00:24:33,532 --> 00:24:37,932
...I'll go out later and we can go to a tacky
place to eat something greasy. Beans with sausage.

303
00:24:38,012 --> 00:24:41,012
- All right, darling.
- Goodbye.

304
00:24:41,092 --> 00:24:44,172
- That's it.
- Now, Fabio, here.

305
00:24:44,772 --> 00:24:48,772
No, but keep smoking and enjoying.

306
00:24:48,852 --> 00:24:52,772
It itches,
of course. You have a sexual itch.

307
00:24:52,852 --> 00:24:54,612
- Fabio, up here.
- Yes, that's it.

308
00:24:54,692 --> 00:24:59,372
Now drill him. Put the
drill next to his neck

309
00:24:59,492 --> 00:25:02,932
and drill his neck.
That's the final moment.

310
00:25:03,012 --> 00:25:06,092
Fabio, no. Take another one.
It's the last picture of the photonovel.

311
00:25:06,172 --> 00:25:10,732
Use your acting talent.
That's it. That's enough, isn't it?

312
00:25:10,932 --> 00:25:13,692
Isn't it? Very good.

313
00:25:13,972 --> 00:25:16,612
- Pedro, can I borrow him one second?
- Hello, Johnny.

314
00:25:17,172 --> 00:25:21,012
- Fabio, you have a visitor.
- How are you doing, Johnny?

315
00:25:22,412 --> 00:25:25,572
It's my new look for
Photo Porno Sexy Fever.

316
00:25:27,132 --> 00:25:31,332
- They've destroyed you.
- I'm Soft Queen Killer Bang.

317
00:25:32,372 --> 00:25:36,132
- Have you got a minute? I'd like to talk.
- I have all the time in the world...

318
00:25:36,252 --> 00:25:38,692
- And can we talk here?
- ...to love you

319
00:25:39,252 --> 00:25:42,332
and destroy you with a kiss of death.

320
00:25:43,132 --> 00:25:46,972
- I want to change my look.
- I see.

321
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:50,212
- I want you to completely transform me.
- No problem.

322
00:25:50,532 --> 00:25:54,572
I'm the most sought-after beautician

323
00:25:55,292 --> 00:25:58,892
in the gutters of New York, LA and Berlin.

324
00:25:59,252 --> 00:26:03,452
Here I have The Golden Book of a Coiffeur.

325
00:26:03,732 --> 00:26:06,372
- Coiffeurs of Paris. Very big and loose.
- No, no.

326
00:26:06,732 --> 00:26:08,732
- Styles for day and night.
- No.

327
00:26:08,812 --> 00:26:12,492
- For the woman...
- No, no. This won't do. No.

328
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:15,892
For the woman who is
very sporty and very mischievous.

329
00:26:15,972 --> 00:26:22,212
This isn't bad, but it'd be too much.
I want something simpler, more...

330
00:26:22,332 --> 00:26:25,772
More trendy, more... More confusing.

331
00:26:26,012 --> 00:26:27,812
Simple was never trendy.

332
00:26:27,892 --> 00:26:30,110
- Besides, I think...
- Trendy is always futuristic.

333
00:26:30,212 --> 00:26:33,892
- Futurism is glitter.
- I don't have so much to do it with.

334
00:26:35,172 --> 00:26:39,172
I don't have enough hair.
It must be simple, but very colourful.

335
00:26:39,252 --> 00:26:43,772
- There are some gorgeous wigs. Raffia, nylon...
- But look at what I have.

336
00:26:45,372 --> 00:26:47,372
With this, I don't know.

337
00:26:47,452 --> 00:26:53,092
Some crazy colour from London
could shock the eyes.

338
00:26:53,492 --> 00:26:56,452
Take my disguise.
Do what you want with me, I don't care.

339
00:26:56,532 --> 00:27:00,212
I'll turn you into the queen of Halloween.

340
00:27:08,812 --> 00:27:12,492
They're the best. They're
great. There they are.

341
00:27:14,732 --> 00:27:19,252
- There aren't many people in the audience.
- No, but they are enthusiastic. Ask them.

342
00:27:19,732 --> 00:27:23,572
- Do you like them?
- They're the best!

343
00:27:24,092 --> 00:27:28,012
Wait,
let's ask some people. What do you think?

344
00:27:28,652 --> 00:27:31,372
- They're crap.
- She's just envious.

345
00:27:31,692 --> 00:27:34,652
A thousand for a bit of hash.

346
00:27:34,852 --> 00:27:38,292
Hey, where's the toilet?

347
00:27:38,372 --> 00:27:41,812
- Over there.
- I can't hear anything. Where?

348
00:27:41,892 --> 00:27:43,252
Wait here, Fabio.

349
00:27:43,332 --> 00:27:45,612
Los Melancolicos can't perform.

350
00:27:45,732 --> 00:27:47,452
- You know why, of course.
- I know.

351
00:27:47,532 --> 00:27:50,172
- So Ellos will perform instead.
- Ellos.

352
00:27:50,252 --> 00:27:52,612
Ellos will perform. Ellos.

353
00:27:52,692 --> 00:27:54,732
- Do the introductions, come on.
- Let's go.

354
00:28:03,012 --> 00:28:05,892
Los Melancolicos can't be with you tonight

355
00:28:05,972 --> 00:28:12,932
due to problems with drugs, child trafficking,
white slavery and a few other things.

356
00:28:13,132 --> 00:28:19,892
But instead, we'll have a group
you all know and hate.

357
00:28:19,972 --> 00:28:26,692
Their name is Ellos. But until they arrive,
my friend and I will improvise a song

358
00:28:26,772 --> 00:28:32,292
if the deejay doesn't mind playing
a random funky backing track.

359
00:28:32,372 --> 00:28:36,132
We're going to sing it right now. Okay,
let's go.

360
00:30:05,372 --> 00:30:11,092
How could you change the program?
We don't want to work with Ellos.

361
00:30:11,172 --> 00:30:13,532
- If you forget, I don't.
- Nor do we.

362
00:30:13,612 --> 00:30:15,988
I've talked with Sonobox
and they want to record your album.

363
00:30:16,012 --> 00:30:17,612
Our album?

364
00:30:20,292 --> 00:30:23,652
- This is great.
- My God.

365
00:30:29,932 --> 00:30:32,052
Stay away from my boyfriend, you slapper.

366
00:30:33,252 --> 00:30:35,012
Eusebio!

367
00:30:36,052 --> 00:30:41,852
Eusebio, my darling!
We have to go to the hospital!

368
00:30:42,452 --> 00:30:43,812
To the hospital, sweetie.

369
00:30:43,892 --> 00:30:46,452
- We have to perform.
- Perform? Look at us!

370
00:30:46,972 --> 00:30:49,012
- Bastard.
- What do we do now?

371
00:30:49,132 --> 00:30:51,692
I don't know what he tripped over.

372
00:30:51,772 --> 00:30:54,692
- Where's the toilet?
- The toilet? Come with me.

373
00:30:54,772 --> 00:30:56,172
Let's go to the VIP area.

374
00:31:20,332 --> 00:31:21,732
What, don't you sing?

375
00:31:21,812 --> 00:31:23,812
- I have a sore throat.
- And you?

376
00:31:24,412 --> 00:31:25,692
I'm shy.

377
00:31:27,012 --> 00:31:30,092
- Why don't you sing?
- Yeah, right, I'm past it.

378
00:31:30,172 --> 00:31:32,172
Don't be stupid, but...

379
00:31:32,972 --> 00:31:36,332
- Let's think of something.
- We'll have to think of something.

380
00:31:36,452 --> 00:31:39,252
- How's it going?
- We can play instrumental songs.

381
00:31:39,852 --> 00:31:42,052
- What a great jacket.
- Do you like it?

382
00:31:42,572 --> 00:31:45,692
- I love it.
- Want to try it on?

383
00:31:46,892 --> 00:31:48,812
- Yes.
- Don't be shy.

384
00:31:48,892 --> 00:31:51,812
- I love your make-up.
- Do you like cosmetics?

385
00:31:51,892 --> 00:31:54,772
- I love this.
- It's mine.

386
00:31:54,852 --> 00:31:58,052
- Do you play with it?
- No, we use it to put on make-up.

387
00:31:58,132 --> 00:32:00,812
- Is this for the cheeks?
- Yes. You look good.

388
00:32:02,092 --> 00:32:07,452
- Do you know a song called Big Bargain?
- Big Bargain, yes, I heard it at Fabio's place.

389
00:32:07,532 --> 00:32:11,812
Great, you've given me a wonderful idea.

390
00:34:59,652 --> 00:35:01,932
- This is great.
- Awesome.

391
00:35:02,012 --> 00:35:05,852
- I'm on fire.
- What do you think?

392
00:35:05,932 --> 00:35:07,132
- Who, me?
- Yes.

393
00:35:07,212 --> 00:35:10,892
- I always wanted to be a rock star.
- Great, congratulations. What's your name?

394
00:35:11,012 --> 00:35:12,532
- Johnny.
- You did great.

395
00:35:12,612 --> 00:35:14,372
The audience is mad for it.

396
00:35:15,692 --> 00:35:18,932
Even Sonobox liked it.
They're going to sign a contract with us.

397
00:35:19,012 --> 00:35:20,732
Really? They liked it?

398
00:35:20,812 --> 00:35:23,252
- Not only you, but the girls, too.
- Am I singing?

399
00:35:23,332 --> 00:35:25,452
- You have to.
- Those bitches?

400
00:35:25,572 --> 00:35:28,772
Bitches and whatever you want,
but they're really hot.

401
00:35:28,852 --> 00:35:31,852
Yes, yes.

402
00:35:31,932 --> 00:35:34,132
The important thing is that you're happy.

403
00:35:34,532 --> 00:35:36,492
- You, new guy, pick a number.
- Seven.

404
00:35:36,572 --> 00:35:39,612
- My favourite number.
- Take a line.

405
00:35:41,692 --> 00:35:44,052
What a great success. We have to celebrate.

406
00:35:44,332 --> 00:35:47,052
- Why don't you come home and have a drink?
- To your place?

407
00:35:47,172 --> 00:35:48,972
Well, yes.

408
00:35:54,252 --> 00:35:56,852
- Do you want to come to a party?
- At Garces' place.

409
00:35:57,252 --> 00:35:58,372
Let's go.

410
00:36:04,052 --> 00:36:05,332
What's up with you?

411
00:36:07,172 --> 00:36:08,612
Bloody hell.

412
00:36:30,452 --> 00:36:32,652
- Stop, guys.
- What's up?

413
00:36:32,812 --> 00:36:34,932
I don't feel like it today.

414
00:36:35,012 --> 00:36:37,372
- You can't leave now.
- Haven't you had enough?

415
00:36:37,452 --> 00:36:39,892
Come on, stay.

416
00:36:52,452 --> 00:36:55,172
What's up? Is something wrong?

417
00:36:55,292 --> 00:36:58,452
No, nothing.
It must be today's emotions, I don't know.

418
00:36:59,132 --> 00:37:01,480
- Let's leave it for some other time.
- You don't mind?

419
00:38:12,732 --> 00:38:14,572
- Hi.
- Hi.

420
00:38:15,332 --> 00:38:18,132
- May I come in?
- Yes, of course.

421
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:26,452
- You must be wondering why I'm here.
- I'm glad you came.

422
00:38:26,532 --> 00:38:31,212
I went to an orgy after the concert,
but I could only think of you.

423
00:38:32,332 --> 00:38:34,132
- Do you think I'm crazy?
- No.

424
00:38:34,252 --> 00:38:36,557
Same thing happened to me.
I couldn't sleep all night.

425
00:38:36,612 --> 00:38:39,252
- Really?
- I couldn't get you out of my head.

426
00:38:39,852 --> 00:38:42,212
Get into bed, you'll get cold.

427
00:38:44,612 --> 00:38:47,972
- Do you want to lie down, too?
- I'll lie down for a while.

428
00:38:54,812 --> 00:38:56,612
I'm really glad you came.

429
00:38:58,092 --> 00:39:01,772
- I'm dead tired.
- Do you want to sleep?

430
00:39:15,812 --> 00:39:19,332
- Sexi, I want to see you again.
- Me, too.

431
00:39:19,692 --> 00:39:24,292
But if you live here, it'll be trouble with
Santi. As you can see, we can't stand each other.

432
00:39:24,372 --> 00:39:28,572
- I don't live here. My things are in a hotel.
- That's better.

433
00:39:28,652 --> 00:39:30,932
But don't tell them a word about this.

434
00:39:31,052 --> 00:39:34,412
It'd be a lot of trouble,
and I don't want to let you go.

435
00:39:35,852 --> 00:39:37,452
That'll be difficult.

436
00:39:39,052 --> 00:39:42,332
I have to leave in a month's time.
I don't live in Madrid.

437
00:39:42,452 --> 00:39:45,732
Really? Where do you live?
I'll go with you, no matter where.

438
00:39:46,252 --> 00:39:48,372
In Panama. On the island of Contadora.

439
00:39:48,452 --> 00:39:53,052
On an island? I hate the sea
and the beach. It drives me mad.

440
00:39:53,132 --> 00:39:54,892
Why don't we move somewhere else?

441
00:39:57,612 --> 00:40:00,452
- My family lives there.
- I don't understand.

442
00:40:01,412 --> 00:40:05,012
I'm the son of the Emperor of Tiran.
I'm incognito in Madrid.

443
00:40:05,092 --> 00:40:06,492
You're Riza Niro?

444
00:40:07,052 --> 00:40:09,692
That's why your face looked familiar to me.

445
00:40:11,452 --> 00:40:15,132
I didn't want to tell anybody,
but I can't lie to you.

446
00:40:15,932 --> 00:40:18,212
I'll go with you, no matter where.

447
00:40:19,932 --> 00:40:24,252
- And your family? And the group?
- My dad doesn't care what I do.

448
00:40:24,332 --> 00:40:27,372
And the girls... I'll think of something.

449
00:40:27,492 --> 00:40:31,092
But you can't breathe a word to them,
especially with all this going on.

450
00:40:31,372 --> 00:40:35,292
- I'll lie to them.
- Don't ever lie to me. I hate it.

451
00:40:35,372 --> 00:40:38,372
- To you? I couldn't.
- Very well.

452
00:40:50,532 --> 00:40:52,532
Wait here a moment, please.

453
00:40:56,812 --> 00:41:00,492
- Those clothes are mine.
- I'm sorry. I didn't notice.

454
00:41:00,612 --> 00:41:03,892
- What cheek!
- I swear this is the first time I wore them.

455
00:41:03,972 --> 00:41:06,532
If you had asked for them,
you could have borrowed them.

456
00:41:06,692 --> 00:41:09,612
Well, there's a taxi waiting for me.
I'll give you a lift.

457
00:41:10,252 --> 00:41:12,292
- Come on.
- But I'm embarrassed.

458
00:41:12,412 --> 00:41:14,012
Don't be shy.

459
00:41:16,092 --> 00:41:17,212
Come in.

460
00:41:18,012 --> 00:41:19,452
You're so nice.

461
00:41:23,212 --> 00:41:25,412
I'm a fan of yours, you know?

462
00:41:26,412 --> 00:41:29,092
- I've been to all of your concerts.
- Really?

463
00:41:29,652 --> 00:41:32,012
I know all your songs by heart.

464
00:41:32,572 --> 00:41:36,412
I love imitating you.
That's why I'm wearing your clothes.

465
00:41:36,492 --> 00:41:40,012
- Don't worry. Do you like music?
- Yes.

466
00:41:40,292 --> 00:41:44,492
- It's the only thing that makes me forget.
- Why, aren't you happy with your life?

467
00:41:44,572 --> 00:41:47,172
No. I'd trade it for anybody else's.

468
00:41:47,252 --> 00:41:50,492
- How come?
- I have a lot of problems.

469
00:41:50,572 --> 00:41:54,252
- Everybody has problems.
- But I'm traumatised.

470
00:41:54,332 --> 00:41:57,092
Come on. Tell me,
I'm sure it's not that bad.

471
00:41:57,612 --> 00:42:03,452
My mother left us a few months ago.
Now I live with my father, but he's crazy.

472
00:42:03,532 --> 00:42:09,132
He mistakes me for my mother
from time to time. And then he forces me.

473
00:42:09,212 --> 00:42:11,052
- Do you mean he rapes you?
- Yes.

474
00:42:11,252 --> 00:42:13,452
- And do you let him?
- You don't know how he gets.

475
00:42:13,532 --> 00:42:17,412
He goes out of his mind.
I don't know what to do.

476
00:42:17,612 --> 00:42:20,372
- Perhaps you like it.
- No, of course I don't like it.

477
00:42:20,452 --> 00:42:23,532
The thing is, you get used to everything.

478
00:42:23,932 --> 00:42:26,532
Does he do it very often?

479
00:42:26,612 --> 00:42:29,652
- Every second day.
- Incredible. And doesn't he ever skip one?

480
00:42:29,732 --> 00:42:35,652
Never. He takes an aphrodisiac every second
day, you know? And that's when he rapes me.

481
00:42:35,772 --> 00:42:39,732
- You have to give him an antidote.
- That's what I do. What did you think?

482
00:42:39,812 --> 00:42:42,332
But it has no effect.

483
00:42:42,652 --> 00:42:48,052
I have a friend called Paco. He's a
chemist. He might tell us what to do.

484
00:42:48,612 --> 00:42:50,892
- I ironed your shirt.
- Very well.

485
00:42:51,012 --> 00:42:55,852
And don't forget to wear a cotton T-shirt.
It's very cold in Oslo.

486
00:42:55,932 --> 00:42:58,548
- All right. Take care of my parakeets.
- Don't worry, I will.

487
00:42:58,572 --> 00:43:00,748
- See if they sing, it's important...
- I know. Don't worry.

488
00:43:00,772 --> 00:43:02,732
I'll take care of the birds.

489
00:43:02,812 --> 00:43:04,412
- Hello.
- Hello, Sexi.

490
00:43:04,532 --> 00:43:08,132
I'm going to Oslo for a couple of days.
Do you want something from there?

491
00:43:08,212 --> 00:43:10,748
>From Oslo? I can't think of anything.
Do you want anything from Oslo?

492
00:43:10,772 --> 00:43:13,228
- Me? No, thanks. You're very kind.
- Don't bring her anything.

493
00:43:13,252 --> 00:43:16,012
I'm going to pack my
luggage. See you later.

494
00:43:16,092 --> 00:43:19,212
Shall we make some coffee?
The girls are coming for a rehearsal.

495
00:43:19,292 --> 00:43:22,492
- I'll make coffee and some juice.
- Would you like to stay?

496
00:43:22,572 --> 00:43:25,212
- Yes, but not for long. I have to leave early.
- Okay.

497
00:43:25,292 --> 00:43:27,732
What a pity. Nobody
called you this morning.

498
00:43:27,852 --> 00:43:31,292
- The telephone didn't ring once.
- There's nothing we can do about it.

499
00:43:31,532 --> 00:43:33,252
I'll make the juice.

500
00:43:33,372 --> 00:43:37,772
Cherries, raspberries... I'll make a
cocktail. And I'll also put some papaya in it.

501
00:43:37,852 --> 00:43:41,852
But there's no papaya in Spain.
Never mind, I'll use some bananas.

502
00:43:43,372 --> 00:43:46,292
At last, I'm shattered.

503
00:43:46,372 --> 00:43:50,252
I love your walls.

504
00:43:50,332 --> 00:43:52,452
- The colours are great.
- Aren't they?

505
00:43:52,532 --> 00:43:57,212
I just love them. The combination
is awesome. Look at it. Pink...

506
00:43:58,052 --> 00:44:01,212
I love it. And your father...

507
00:44:01,892 --> 00:44:05,252
- He's very good-looking. I like him a lot.
- He's very successful.

508
00:44:05,772 --> 00:44:08,932
That's great. Doesn't your mother mind
his being so successful?

509
00:44:09,012 --> 00:44:12,892
- My mother died a while ago.
- I'm sorry.

510
00:44:15,772 --> 00:44:18,052
- This is too much. Is that your robe?
- Yes.

511
00:44:20,572 --> 00:44:24,252
- Hi, Paco, it's Sexi.
- Hi, Sexi, how are you?

512
00:44:24,412 --> 00:44:26,252
I'm sitting here with a friend.

513
00:44:26,332 --> 00:44:32,172
She has some problems because her father takes
an aphrodisiac every second day and rapes her.

514
00:44:32,292 --> 00:44:35,372
Do you know any antidote?

515
00:44:35,652 --> 00:44:38,652
- What does her father take?
- Wait a second.

516
00:44:38,732 --> 00:44:41,452
- Hey, what does your father take?
- Vitopens.

517
00:44:41,532 --> 00:44:45,652
- Vitopens.
- But that's pure dynamite. There's no antidote.

518
00:44:45,772 --> 00:44:50,252
- She's giving him something against it.
- Ask her what it's called.

519
00:44:50,332 --> 00:44:54,932
- Wait. What do you give him against Vitopens?
- Benzamuro.

520
00:44:55,052 --> 00:44:57,412
- Benzamuro.
- Benzamuro?

521
00:44:58,092 --> 00:45:03,412
That's an awful mix. It causes paranoia.
She must stop giving him that.

522
00:45:03,492 --> 00:45:06,332
I'll tell her right now.
I'll call you one of these days.

523
00:45:06,412 --> 00:45:08,452
- I hope you will.
- Goodbye.

524
00:45:08,812 --> 00:45:13,052
Listen, you can't give him Benzamuro.
The mix is what makes him paranoid.

525
00:45:13,132 --> 00:45:17,972
- Really?
- Yes. Unless you want him to shag you every day.

526
00:45:18,052 --> 00:45:19,772
- No.
- Then there's nothing we can do.

527
00:45:19,852 --> 00:45:23,292
- That's not the point.
- I'm going to take this off, I can't stand it.

528
00:45:27,012 --> 00:45:28,612
- Hello.
- Hello.

529
00:45:28,692 --> 00:45:33,132
- What's up?
- Queti, Angustias and Nana.

530
00:45:33,212 --> 00:45:35,172
- How are you doing?
- Hello.

531
00:45:35,412 --> 00:45:38,692
- I'm tired but delighted, darling.
- That's good.

532
00:45:41,812 --> 00:45:44,892
- Do you work in the music industry?
- No, I'm just a fan of Sexi's.

533
00:45:44,972 --> 00:45:46,172
- I see.
- One of my fans.

534
00:45:46,252 --> 00:45:50,332
Leave that thing alone,
it makes me nervous.

535
00:45:51,532 --> 00:45:55,132
The thing is,
I'd like to be a singer like her.

536
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:57,148
- Well, go ahead. It's the best life.
- Really?

537
00:45:57,172 --> 00:46:01,932
I had a huge complex, but I started
to play the drums and now I'm cured.

538
00:46:02,012 --> 00:46:03,668
- Why did you have a complex?
- Let me explain.

539
00:46:03,692 --> 00:46:05,892
She had very fat thighs.

540
00:46:06,052 --> 00:46:08,812
- Weak nails.
- And dry lips.

541
00:46:09,172 --> 00:46:12,132
And I swallow air when I eat, so I fart.

542
00:46:12,772 --> 00:46:14,812
- That's all easy to solve.
- I don't think so.

543
00:46:14,892 --> 00:46:17,652
- You'll see. I'll give you something for your lips.
- Really?

544
00:46:17,732 --> 00:46:20,692
I'll love it. Look.

545
00:46:21,292 --> 00:46:23,652
- Shut up.
- She says I scratch.

546
00:46:23,772 --> 00:46:25,412
- Try this.
- Are you sure?

547
00:46:25,492 --> 00:46:31,892
- Ten grams of cocoa butter, three of castor oil...
- Let's see.

548
00:46:31,972 --> 00:46:37,212
...one gram of KTQ extract,
two drops of birch oil

549
00:46:37,292 --> 00:46:44,172
and five grams of vadiana oil.
Use it and you'll be a new woman.

550
00:46:44,252 --> 00:46:46,452
Where did you learn all that?

551
00:46:46,532 --> 00:46:50,772
Nowhere. I learned this at home.
My father has a lot of problems...

552
00:46:50,852 --> 00:46:55,012
He buys every single beauty magazine,
and I read them, too.

553
00:46:55,092 --> 00:46:57,732
So if you want anything, just let me know.

554
00:46:57,812 --> 00:47:02,052
- Give me something to be ugly.
- She needs something to be more intelligent.

555
00:47:02,132 --> 00:47:03,532
Yes, my God. Look.

556
00:47:03,612 --> 00:47:07,132
- I can give you some gum if you want.
- Do you have mint?

557
00:47:07,252 --> 00:47:11,772
Mint flavour?
I have electric and rubber. It's up to you.

558
00:47:12,572 --> 00:47:15,092
Come on! No way!

559
00:47:15,172 --> 00:47:17,452
- No. No!
- Come on.

560
00:47:17,572 --> 00:47:20,652
- Oh, my God!
- Come on, girl!

561
00:47:21,492 --> 00:47:25,652
- Come on, I'll give you something for your thighs.
- For my thighs? Yes.

562
00:47:25,732 --> 00:47:28,868
- And for your flatulence.
- Don't say a word, but that's my biggest complex.

563
00:47:28,892 --> 00:47:30,892
I'm not surprised. I'll give you something.

564
00:47:30,972 --> 00:47:36,772
You have to do five push-ups every morning
in front of the window, naked if possible.

565
00:47:36,852 --> 00:47:39,212
- Five?
- Cold, freezing.

566
00:47:39,292 --> 00:47:41,332
- How are you doing?
- Very well.

567
00:47:41,452 --> 00:47:43,052
- Hello.
- Hello, dear.

568
00:47:43,132 --> 00:47:44,892
- I have great news.
- Do you?

569
00:47:44,972 --> 00:47:47,012
Yes. The guys are recording with Sonobox.

570
00:47:47,092 --> 00:47:48,972
- Wow.
- That's great.

571
00:47:49,052 --> 00:47:53,012
But it's good news. It's a record company
like all the others. A bunch of bastards,

572
00:47:53,092 --> 00:47:55,028
- but it's a record company.
- I didn't know about it.

573
00:47:55,052 --> 00:47:56,892
You look relaxed. So I give you the news

574
00:47:56,972 --> 00:47:59,412
- and you just...
- But what do you want?

575
00:47:59,532 --> 00:48:03,372
- Didn't you know?
- No.

576
00:48:03,452 --> 00:48:07,972
- Sexi, I have to leave.
- Okay. I'll ring you at the dry cleaner's.

577
00:48:08,052 --> 00:48:11,132
- Great, and I'll give this back. I promise.
- Don't worry about it.

578
00:48:11,212 --> 00:48:12,972
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

579
00:48:13,052 --> 00:48:15,572
If this works, I'll owe you one.

580
00:48:15,972 --> 00:48:19,132
Be very careful with her.
She's a nasty nymphomaniac.

581
00:48:19,332 --> 00:48:23,572
At first we were a duo.
Then she was in the group for a while,

582
00:48:23,652 --> 00:48:26,772
but we had to kick her out.
All she thought about was sex.

583
00:48:26,852 --> 00:48:29,932
Now she's formed a group
with these two guys' ex-girlfriends

584
00:48:30,012 --> 00:48:35,132
and they only want to give us a hard time.
The less you talk to them the better.

585
00:48:43,612 --> 00:48:47,372
- Hello.
- Hello. What's up?

586
00:48:47,492 --> 00:48:53,572
- Hey, how are you? How's your leg?
- Fine. I heard you're recording an album.

587
00:48:55,292 --> 00:48:58,492
- So I'm out now that I'm injured?
- Look...

588
00:48:58,572 --> 00:49:01,652
I sing with my mouth, not with my leg.

589
00:49:01,732 --> 00:49:06,932
Yes, but the company wants Johnny to sing.
They saw him and they liked him better.

590
00:49:07,012 --> 00:49:09,068
- We're sorry.
- I see. You're a bunch of bastards.

591
00:49:09,092 --> 00:49:11,292
- I'd thrash you if I weren't injured.
- Eusebio!

592
00:49:11,372 --> 00:49:13,188
- Eusebio, you're going to fall down.
- Relax.

593
00:49:13,212 --> 00:49:15,932
I told you they'd kick you out
before you even knew. My God.

594
00:49:16,012 --> 00:49:17,292
Eusebio!

595
00:49:17,372 --> 00:49:20,372
- Relax.
- And what's with you, poof?

596
00:49:20,452 --> 00:49:24,572
- Watch out.
- What are you doing?

597
00:49:32,092 --> 00:49:36,252
- Relax. Don't touch me.
- Eusebio, come on, let's go.

598
00:49:41,092 --> 00:49:44,532
- You'll hear from me.
- And you from us, about the papers.

599
00:49:44,612 --> 00:49:45,892
Leave it, guys.

600
00:49:47,492 --> 00:49:51,972
You know what? I'm glad. Anyway,
you've been...

601
00:49:52,412 --> 00:49:56,292
How long have you been with them?
Two, three years? And you've made no money.

602
00:49:56,372 --> 00:50:01,572
As if I would sing in a girl band.
We won't get anywhere like this, Eusebio.

603
00:50:01,652 --> 00:50:04,492
We're not two kids anymore,
and I just want to get married.

604
00:50:04,572 --> 00:50:10,172
You should study computer science.
I've heard there's a great future there.

605
00:50:12,492 --> 00:50:14,092
What's up?

606
00:50:15,292 --> 00:50:21,532
- You won't believe it if I explain.
- Try, see what happens.

607
00:50:21,892 --> 00:50:26,732
I have a very good sense of smell.
Better than normal.

608
00:50:27,492 --> 00:50:31,812
I've been looking for a friend for a
few days and one of you smells of him.

609
00:50:32,092 --> 00:50:36,092
- Are you kidding or what?
- Eusebio, leave him. He's obviously high.

610
00:50:36,172 --> 00:50:40,772
- What are you doing?
- Your hand smells of him. Just tell me one thing.

611
00:50:42,292 --> 00:50:46,772
- Who have you touched this evening?
- Come on. What's your friend's name?

612
00:50:50,212 --> 00:50:52,652
- I don't know.
- Come on, pal, that's enough.

613
00:50:52,772 --> 00:50:57,332
I tolerate junkies, but enough is enough.
Don't be stupid. Go on, sod off.

614
00:51:04,132 --> 00:51:07,732
Sadec, we've received the parcel
from our spy in Contadora.

615
00:51:07,852 --> 00:51:10,732
- They're sending a shirt of Riza Niro's.
- Really?

616
00:51:11,172 --> 00:51:14,452
They couldn't get his address.
We'll have to look for him.

617
00:51:14,572 --> 00:51:17,492
- You'll have to give us a hand.
- Don't count on my nose.

618
00:51:17,572 --> 00:51:20,652
- It's seized up.
- What's wrong? Have you got a cold?

619
00:51:20,732 --> 00:51:23,732
- No, I'm in love.
- What?

620
00:51:23,812 --> 00:51:27,172
- In love?
- Yes. I hadn't told you this,

621
00:51:27,612 --> 00:51:33,332
but when I'm in love I
can only smell that person.

622
00:51:33,892 --> 00:51:38,052
- I can only smell the guy I met the other day.
- This is too much.

623
00:51:38,132 --> 00:51:41,492
Sadec, you realise what this
kidnapping means for Tiranian people.

624
00:51:41,572 --> 00:51:43,612
I understand, but I have my own problems.

625
00:51:43,692 --> 00:51:47,692
Do you think your love life is more
important than the fate of your people?

626
00:51:47,772 --> 00:51:50,132
- It is to me.
- You're perverse.

627
00:51:50,332 --> 00:51:55,932
Thanks to that and his nose,
he can find Riza easier than us.

628
00:51:56,012 --> 00:51:57,612
- Look.
- He's also a homosexual.

629
00:51:57,692 --> 00:52:01,132
The places they go to are dumps.

630
00:52:01,692 --> 00:52:04,812
We'll plan everything tomorrow.
I'm very tired now.

631
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:43,972
It's him!

632
00:52:46,092 --> 00:52:47,492
It's him!

633
00:52:50,132 --> 00:52:51,132
It's him!

634
00:53:11,212 --> 00:53:14,252
- Dad, I'm going to do the shopping.
- All right.

635
00:53:14,492 --> 00:53:18,772
- Don't take too long. There's a lot to do.
- I won't, Dad.

636
00:53:24,052 --> 00:53:27,092
Come on, before he reads the letter
and comes out running.

637
00:53:27,172 --> 00:53:28,972
The taxi is waiting for us there.

638
00:53:31,252 --> 00:53:34,132
- Are you sure you want to do this?
- Of course.

639
00:53:38,212 --> 00:53:41,892
I've brought a suitcase with my clothes.
I'll go visit you as soon as I can.

640
00:53:41,972 --> 00:53:44,412
- Great.
- But you can call me whenever you want.

641
00:53:44,492 --> 00:53:48,412
- Everything is paid for, so that's not a problem.
- Fantastic.

642
00:53:48,492 --> 00:53:50,932
- Are you nervous?
- I'm delighted.

643
00:53:51,172 --> 00:53:52,972
And how're things with you?

644
00:53:53,172 --> 00:53:57,412
It's wonderful. I feel
like crazy. The thing is,

645
00:53:57,492 --> 00:54:00,932
- it's so beautiful it scares me sometimes.
- Why?

646
00:54:01,012 --> 00:54:04,132
- You have a lot of experience with men, Sexi.
- I know.

647
00:54:04,212 --> 00:54:08,692
But my experience won't help me here.
With him I want to be different.

648
00:54:11,932 --> 00:54:14,372
- And what's he like in bed?
- I don't know.

649
00:54:14,772 --> 00:54:17,532
- What? You haven't shagged him?
- No. I don't know.

650
00:54:17,612 --> 00:54:21,732
I don't want it to be the same
with him as with the others.

651
00:54:22,812 --> 00:54:28,212
But I'm sure he's longing for it.
Hasn't he laid a hand on you?

652
00:54:28,652 --> 00:54:32,492
Now that I think of it, he hasn't.
Do you think he doesn't find me attractive?

653
00:54:32,572 --> 00:54:34,572
Come on, don't be stupid.

654
00:54:34,652 --> 00:54:39,972
I'm sure he's horny all the time.
But you've become so discreet...

655
00:54:40,052 --> 00:54:45,212
Sure. I told him since the beginning
that we should respect each other.

656
00:54:45,292 --> 00:54:49,132
You told him that? That's so old-fashioned.
You don't look the same anymore.

657
00:54:49,212 --> 00:54:50,772
Neither do you.

658
00:55:10,772 --> 00:55:15,212
CLINIC - OUR LADY OF BEAUTY
COSMETIC SURGERY

659
00:55:15,852 --> 00:55:17,572
This is wonderful.

660
00:55:19,332 --> 00:55:22,772
Gorgeous. It's the best.

661
00:55:25,212 --> 00:55:27,691
- Good morning.
- Hi. We lack everything but want nothing.

662
00:55:27,772 --> 00:55:29,652
At least let me show you what I have.

663
00:55:29,732 --> 00:55:31,612
- How long do you need?
- Just one minute.

664
00:55:31,692 --> 00:55:34,532
- One minute? All right. Go ahead.
- Yes.

665
00:55:34,612 --> 00:55:40,052
These are made of a cosmic metal,
mined from the Earth's core.

666
00:55:40,652 --> 00:55:45,652
- I don't understand. I'm uneducated.
- I thought so, but it's not your fault.

667
00:55:45,732 --> 00:55:47,012
Thanks.

668
00:55:47,452 --> 00:55:50,892
Due to its proximity to
the centre of the Earth,

669
00:55:51,012 --> 00:55:54,772
it channels the positive
vibrations of the stars.

670
00:55:54,852 --> 00:55:56,692
That sounds good.

671
00:55:57,492 --> 00:56:01,492
Since you were a child, you've always had
a clear influence from the stars.

672
00:56:01,572 --> 00:56:07,012
- I didn't know that.
- You've probably only received bad vibrations.

673
00:56:07,092 --> 00:56:09,932
- I've received all of those.
- Of course, so...

674
00:56:10,012 --> 00:56:13,532
- You should try to change your situation.
- Should I buy a medal from you?

675
00:56:13,652 --> 00:56:16,492
Yes,
one or two. This will change your luck.

676
00:56:16,572 --> 00:56:19,172
- My love life?
- It will be completely satisfactory.

677
00:56:19,252 --> 00:56:23,812
- And work-wise?
- Work-wise? Do you have a job? No, you don't.

678
00:56:24,692 --> 00:56:29,052
If you did, you wouldn't need to do much
and you'd have loads of money.

679
00:56:29,132 --> 00:56:31,868
- All right, your minute is over.
- Aren't you going to buy a medal?

680
00:56:31,892 --> 00:56:33,668
- I'm not interested.
- For a poor relative?

681
00:56:33,692 --> 00:56:36,812
- I have no relatives, rich or poor.
- All right.

682
00:56:43,212 --> 00:56:44,412
Angel.

683
00:56:45,572 --> 00:56:49,532
- What are you doing here?
- I live here. I've been talking to my mother.

684
00:56:50,652 --> 00:56:54,012
You look very good. You've changed a lot.

685
00:56:54,132 --> 00:56:59,212
I was a child when you met me,
and now I'm a woman.

686
00:56:59,772 --> 00:57:02,692
- And what a woman!
- Thanks.

687
00:57:03,132 --> 00:57:06,812
- Are you going anywhere?
- To Pontejos, to buy tape for my hats.

688
00:57:06,932 --> 00:57:10,452
- And what are you doing here?
- Nothing much, just selling some medals.

689
00:57:10,532 --> 00:57:12,452
- Do you want to come with me?
- Yes, sure.

690
00:57:12,532 --> 00:57:14,068
- Shall we take the lift?
- Yes, it's here.

691
00:57:14,092 --> 00:57:16,932
- Very well.
- Come in.

692
00:57:17,012 --> 00:57:19,132
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

693
00:57:19,372 --> 00:57:22,172
- Thanks.
- Hi.

694
00:57:24,612 --> 00:57:28,052
- You don't have dry lips anymore.
- No weak nails, either.

695
00:57:29,852 --> 00:57:34,012
- And your thighs are thinner.
- By the way, in case you want to know,

696
00:57:34,932 --> 00:57:39,332
I don't swallow air anymore.
I don't get bloated and I don't fart.

697
00:57:41,132 --> 00:57:45,812
- Will you forgive me someday?
- It depends. We'll see.

698
00:57:46,812 --> 00:57:50,012
- We should date again.
- And the group?

699
00:57:50,212 --> 00:57:52,012
- They don't need to know.
- Don't they?

700
00:57:52,092 --> 00:57:55,172
- And Sexilia?
- I won't say anything.

701
00:57:57,932 --> 00:58:00,132
Take them, take them.

702
00:58:00,532 --> 00:58:04,852
Soft as silk. They're yours, not mine.

703
00:58:06,572 --> 00:58:10,092
We talk much about love,
but we haven't discussed sex yet.

704
00:58:10,212 --> 00:58:15,972
- Please, can't you go a few days without sex?
- Of course. But it's not about that.

705
00:58:16,332 --> 00:58:20,292
Please, understand this. It's the first time
I've been with a guy without shagging him

706
00:58:20,372 --> 00:58:22,732
and without taking drugs,
and I feel very good.

707
00:58:24,252 --> 00:58:27,852
I want you to know
my past. I've had affairs

708
00:58:28,132 --> 00:58:31,892
- and I'd like...
- I'd rather not know. I'd get very jealous.

709
00:58:32,052 --> 00:58:34,612
Leave the past behind. Yours and mine.

710
00:58:35,572 --> 00:58:38,932
I've had affairs as well.
More than you, that's for sure.

711
00:58:39,932 --> 00:58:45,292
- You know what? Let's think about the future.
- The future. That's the problem.

712
00:58:46,172 --> 00:58:49,332
I can only offer you a future
full of luxury and uncertainty.

713
00:58:49,412 --> 00:58:51,452
But don't think about that now.

714
00:58:51,572 --> 00:58:55,572
Enjoy making your album and then
we'll go to Contadora, and we'll see.

715
00:58:55,692 --> 00:58:57,652
Would you like to be an empress?

716
00:58:58,292 --> 00:59:02,052
- It would be an experience.
- My mother wants us to go back to Tiran.

717
00:59:02,132 --> 00:59:07,252
I'm sure it's not more difficult than
managing bitches like Angustias and Nana.

718
00:59:21,812 --> 00:59:24,172
- Shall I make your bed?
- No, thanks.

719
00:59:31,492 --> 00:59:33,612
Come in.

720
00:59:45,292 --> 00:59:48,132
- Can I make your bed, madam?
- Yes.

721
00:59:52,572 --> 00:59:56,972
- Do you think I look good?
- Yes. You look as good as in the magazines.

722
01:01:11,092 --> 01:01:14,452
Don't you even dare ring me.
I don't want to know anything about you.

723
01:01:14,572 --> 01:01:20,412
- But you can ring me whenever you want.
- Keep your generosity for your husband.

724
01:01:20,692 --> 01:01:24,292
- I've given you the best I had.
- And the worst, too.

725
01:01:24,492 --> 01:01:28,092
When a woman like me gives herself,
she gives it all.

726
01:01:28,212 --> 01:01:31,892
We've arrived.
Please, stop here a moment. I'll go on.

727
01:01:32,012 --> 01:01:35,092
Darling, think of it. We're
still in time to go back.

728
01:01:35,172 --> 01:01:36,892
I want to erase you from my life.

729
01:01:36,972 --> 01:01:42,092
I found you here and I'll leave you here, too.
This time I won't come in. I'll just go by.

730
01:01:42,172 --> 01:01:46,292
- As if I hadn't met you.
- All right. Too bad for you.

731
01:01:51,292 --> 01:01:54,732
You're a swine. And don't you ever ring me!

732
01:01:54,852 --> 01:01:57,932
You, either. Come on.

733
01:02:11,372 --> 01:02:14,612
Darling, I'm back.

734
01:02:14,692 --> 01:02:17,372
Remedios, is that you?

735
01:02:17,812 --> 01:02:22,412
- At last!
- I couldn't live without you.

736
01:02:22,652 --> 01:02:25,932
- And our child? Queti?
- She's gone.

737
01:02:27,452 --> 01:02:32,372
That's normal. If I had left at her age,
I wouldn't have done it now.

738
01:02:32,492 --> 01:02:34,772
But the important
thing is that you're back.

739
01:02:35,172 --> 01:02:39,412
You don't know how sad it is to be
abandoned by your wife and your daughter.

740
01:02:39,492 --> 01:02:43,252
- Especially once you're old.
- Don't say that.

741
01:02:43,332 --> 01:02:46,132
- You look better every day.
- But look,

742
01:02:46,292 --> 01:02:52,292
- I took care of myself, in case you came back.
- You're so good to me.

743
01:02:52,692 --> 01:02:56,452
I won't leave ever again. I promise.

744
01:02:56,612 --> 01:02:59,612
Besides, our girl will come
to visit us one of these days.

745
01:02:59,692 --> 01:03:03,652
She'll tell us she's happy
and she'll be more experienced. You'll see.

746
01:03:03,732 --> 01:03:06,612
You know much about life,
so if you say so...

747
01:03:08,092 --> 01:03:09,612
Handsome.

748
01:03:10,332 --> 01:03:14,852
Good morning. What have you brought?

749
01:03:14,932 --> 01:03:19,932
You look amazing.
How did you lose so much weight?

750
01:03:20,492 --> 01:03:22,532
Doctor! How are you?

751
01:03:22,652 --> 01:03:27,132
- Hello, Susana. What a coincidence.
- It's no coincidence. I came to see you.

752
01:03:27,212 --> 01:03:31,212
- I can't. I have to leave now.
- Please, let's have a coffee.

753
01:03:31,292 --> 01:03:33,572
- All right, a coffee.
- Sure.

754
01:03:34,092 --> 01:03:38,412
I wanted to talk to you about Sexilia. She's
not coming to my office, and I'm worried.

755
01:03:38,492 --> 01:03:42,772
I guess that means she doesn't need you.
She looks much better lately.

756
01:03:42,852 --> 01:03:47,532
But what would you know? You don't know
her, and you haven't taken care of her.

757
01:03:47,612 --> 01:03:50,732
- Did you come to tell me off?
- No. Not at all.

758
01:03:50,812 --> 01:03:56,252
I came to talk about sex.
I want to have sex with you.

759
01:03:59,972 --> 01:04:04,892
I'll be honest. I've never been interested
in sex, not even when I was young.

760
01:04:04,972 --> 01:04:09,012
There's something dirty and disgusting
about the union of two bodies.

761
01:04:09,852 --> 01:04:15,052
That's why I've devoted my work
to artificial insemination.

762
01:04:15,332 --> 01:04:20,252
But how can someone
so elegant and handsome,

763
01:04:20,692 --> 01:04:26,772
with that voice and those suggestive eyes,
say something so stupid?

764
01:04:27,012 --> 01:04:30,452
- It's because you haven't had proper sex.
- Please.

765
01:04:30,532 --> 01:04:34,292
I can prove you wrong. Tell me.

766
01:04:34,412 --> 01:04:38,572
- Please, Susana.
- Tell me one thing. Is there something you like?

767
01:04:38,652 --> 01:04:40,852
Do you do anything special in bed? Tell me.

768
01:04:40,972 --> 01:04:45,972
Tell me. You can trust me, I'm a
psychologist. Tell me. I'm not fastidious.

769
01:04:46,092 --> 01:04:48,108
- Waiter, the bill, please.
- I like everything.

770
01:04:48,132 --> 01:04:51,012
- You can trust me...
- Keep the change.

771
01:04:51,092 --> 01:04:53,372
- Can't you?
- I think we've talked enough.

772
01:04:53,492 --> 01:04:59,412
No, no. Don't worry,
it was a scientific joke. Wait, please.

773
01:04:59,492 --> 01:05:02,452
I'm a devoted researcher.

774
01:05:02,732 --> 01:05:06,332
If you don't like experiments, we can
stick to theory. We can work together.

775
01:05:06,452 --> 01:05:08,428
Please,
let go of me. People are looking at us.

776
01:05:08,452 --> 01:05:12,532
- Don't worry about me.
- The girl... Thanks.

777
01:05:12,612 --> 01:05:15,892
She still has some problems.
You and I can help her...

778
01:05:15,972 --> 01:05:20,092
- Leave us both alone.
- But I finally...

779
01:05:29,852 --> 01:05:31,892
- Good morning, Princess.
- Good morning.

780
01:05:34,812 --> 01:05:36,652
There's a telegram for you.

781
01:05:53,492 --> 01:05:56,732
"Riza is staying in the same hotel as you.
Room number three."

782
01:05:56,812 --> 01:06:01,492
"Couldn't get Emperor's semen.
Sarah furious to know you are fertile."

783
01:06:05,572 --> 01:06:08,172
- Hello.
- Hello.

784
01:06:08,652 --> 01:06:11,772
- Don't you recognise me?
- No, I don't think so.

785
01:06:14,132 --> 01:06:16,692
I think we'll get to know each other soon.

786
01:06:55,292 --> 01:06:57,652
- What are you doing here?
- And you?

787
01:06:57,772 --> 01:06:59,692
I asked first.

788
01:07:00,332 --> 01:07:02,452
- You wouldn't imagine.
- No.

789
01:07:02,972 --> 01:07:05,332
- Can't you tell?
- You're a bitch.

790
01:07:05,452 --> 01:07:07,012
How dare you?

791
01:07:07,132 --> 01:07:11,972
- You are the biggest man-eater in the country.
- That was before. Riza's love has changed me.

792
01:07:12,052 --> 01:07:15,212
- Riza's love?
- Yes, we're together.

793
01:07:15,332 --> 01:07:18,772
That's terrible. I can't even imagine it.

794
01:07:18,892 --> 01:07:22,652
Why have you done it? You've had everything
a woman wants. Money, beauty, fame.

795
01:07:22,732 --> 01:07:25,572
You've been an empress.
You've done movies. What else do you want?

796
01:07:25,852 --> 01:07:30,052
I have a long-standing debt
with his father and the people of Tiran.

797
01:07:30,332 --> 01:07:32,452
And Toraya always pays.

798
01:07:33,372 --> 01:07:38,052
- You haven't given up.
- History has been unfair to me.

799
01:07:38,172 --> 01:07:43,332
- I had to prove they were wrong.
- And did you have to shag my boyfriend?

800
01:07:44,452 --> 01:07:47,732
- He's a Salebi. That's enough.
- You're crazy.

801
01:07:47,852 --> 01:07:51,132
- Riza could have had better taste.
- Really?

802
01:07:51,892 --> 01:07:55,812
- I was the first woman in his life.
- You're nuts!

803
01:07:55,892 --> 01:07:58,772
- Ask him.
- Sexi, I didn't think you'd come so early.

804
01:07:58,852 --> 01:08:00,572
- Yes, I see.
- Well...

805
01:08:01,652 --> 01:08:04,932
- Let me explain. Probably...
- Have you told her she was your first woman?

806
01:08:05,012 --> 01:08:06,988
- Yes, but let me explain.
- There's nothing to explain!

807
01:08:07,012 --> 01:08:08,972
It's not what you are thinking.

808
01:08:09,812 --> 01:08:13,692
When I said there shouldn't be lies
I meant with other people, not each other.

809
01:08:13,772 --> 01:08:15,972
Sexi, I love you.

810
01:08:16,692 --> 01:08:19,332
- Stop lying.
- You're the most important thing in my life.

811
01:08:19,412 --> 01:08:20,828
- If you wanted to shag...
- No, no.

812
01:08:20,852 --> 01:08:25,132
...you only had to say so. This is
ridiculous. We spoke so much about love.

813
01:08:26,172 --> 01:08:27,492
Is this love?

814
01:08:30,292 --> 01:08:33,052
- Don't worry. I'll never fall in love again.
- Sexi!

815
01:09:08,812 --> 01:09:11,852
Who's calling like that? Oh, it's you.

816
01:09:11,932 --> 01:09:15,772
- I knew you'd come back.
- The sun.

817
01:09:17,292 --> 01:09:19,572
The sun in Spain.

818
01:09:20,172 --> 01:09:23,372
Wait for me here. I'll
be with you right now.

819
01:09:27,052 --> 01:09:32,052
Alicia, I'm sorry. We can't continue.
Someone has worse problems than you.

820
01:09:32,172 --> 01:09:35,692
- Worse than me? I don't think so.
- Don't be stupid. Sit down, come on.

821
01:09:35,812 --> 01:09:39,572
I don't want to. I should throw myself out
of the window and cut the psychology thing.

822
01:09:39,692 --> 01:09:42,772
- I'd be better off.
- Take this pill.

823
01:09:42,932 --> 01:09:46,372
Relax, now. Sleep. Be good.

824
01:09:52,492 --> 01:09:57,092
Sleep, sleep. And who's going to the airport
this afternoon? Crappy psychologists!

825
01:09:58,132 --> 01:10:01,412
The sun is very hot.

826
01:10:02,212 --> 01:10:05,332
The sun is burning me.

827
01:10:06,892 --> 01:10:09,812
- Where are you?
- On the beach,

828
01:10:10,972 --> 01:10:12,692
and he's by my side.

829
01:10:14,012 --> 01:10:15,292
We're playing.

830
01:10:15,932 --> 01:10:19,092
Drill me a little hole. A hole.

831
01:10:19,412 --> 01:10:20,532
To breathe.

832
01:10:23,652 --> 01:10:24,852
What's up?

833
01:10:32,012 --> 01:10:34,292
Riza, let's play hide-and-seek.

834
01:10:35,492 --> 01:10:37,292
Can you fetch us?

835
01:10:56,052 --> 01:11:02,212
Why are you so cruel? Just like your father.
Don't reject me, too. Don't you like me?

836
01:11:02,332 --> 01:11:07,012
Riza, you could make me pregnant.
Please, don't leave.

837
01:11:07,092 --> 01:11:13,012
- Come with me. Come on. Leave her. Let's play.
- I like you so much. Please, don't leave.

838
01:11:13,412 --> 01:11:15,012
He prefers her.

839
01:11:18,212 --> 01:11:20,732
- Dad, Dad, come here.
- I can't right now.

840
01:11:20,812 --> 01:11:23,532
- There's a lady here. Come.
- I can't right now.

841
01:11:23,652 --> 01:11:27,612
- Come!
- I can't. I have to talk to that man. Let go.

842
01:11:43,532 --> 01:11:46,572
Hey, do you want to play
husband and wife with us?

843
01:11:46,652 --> 01:11:48,692
- I want to, too.
- Me, too.

844
01:11:48,972 --> 01:11:51,172
Yes, I'll be the wife of you all.

845
01:11:55,612 --> 01:11:57,812
Life is so unfair to me!

846
01:12:24,652 --> 01:12:26,652
- Madam!
- Hello, Melinda.

847
01:12:26,732 --> 01:12:29,532
The telephone didn't stop ringing today.

848
01:12:29,612 --> 01:12:33,052
A friend called to say she's waiting
for you in the bar around the corner.

849
01:12:33,172 --> 01:12:38,012
- And when did she call?
- Just now. About 10 minutes ago.

850
01:12:38,092 --> 01:12:41,372
- A boy called, too, Manuel Angel.
- Yes.

851
01:12:41,572 --> 01:12:44,252
He'll be waiting for you
this afternoon on Orellana Street

852
01:12:44,332 --> 01:12:46,612
- to take some pictures.
- All right.

853
01:12:47,132 --> 01:12:50,732
But look at you,
you look ragged! Turn around.

854
01:12:50,852 --> 01:12:53,292
- A foreigner called, too.
- And what did he say?

855
01:12:53,412 --> 01:12:56,852
- He said... He phoned several times.
- Tell me what he said.

856
01:12:56,972 --> 01:13:01,132
- He said he was rehearsing, and it was urgent.
- Okay.

857
01:13:02,492 --> 01:13:04,692
And Angel phoned, too.

858
01:13:05,412 --> 01:13:08,852
He wanted to have dinner with her tonight.
And little Carolina,

859
01:13:08,932 --> 01:13:12,132
a friend from her childhood.
They went to school together.

860
01:13:21,412 --> 01:13:23,212
This is crazy.

861
01:13:24,372 --> 01:13:26,652
- Hi. Have you finished yet?
- What do you think?

862
01:13:26,772 --> 01:13:30,772
I thought you weren't coming.
What's up? Are you tired?

863
01:13:30,852 --> 01:13:34,372
- Order something simple. I'm knackered.
- Thanks, I don't want anything.

864
01:13:34,492 --> 01:13:38,092
- What's up?
- I went to see Johnny in the morning.

865
01:13:38,692 --> 01:13:42,812
I haven't told you yet,
but he's the son of the Emperor of Tiran.

866
01:13:43,172 --> 01:13:44,492
You're kidding!

867
01:13:46,332 --> 01:13:49,012
Let's go to the toilet,
you have to change your clothes.

868
01:13:49,092 --> 01:13:53,692
- And we're very obvious here. I'll tell you later.
- Let's go.

869
01:13:55,972 --> 01:13:59,172
When I left the hotel,
I decided not to see him ever again.

870
01:14:00,652 --> 01:14:04,612
But after knowing
about Toraya and the beach... I don't know.

871
01:14:05,092 --> 01:14:09,172
You have to tell him everything. What happened
on the beach happened again in the hotel,

872
01:14:09,252 --> 01:14:14,012
but you're not 10 anymore.
Don't let Toraya win again.

873
01:14:14,532 --> 01:14:17,572
You're right.
But why did he have to sleep with her?

874
01:14:18,092 --> 01:14:20,932
Is it so hard to live
without sex for a few days?

875
01:14:21,052 --> 01:14:23,492
Don't be silly.
Who cares about one fuck more or less?

876
01:14:23,572 --> 01:14:27,852
It's all clear now and you love him.
Find him and explain that to him.

877
01:14:27,932 --> 01:14:33,572
Or do you prefer Toraya to go with him to
Tiran, overthrow the regime and become empress?

878
01:14:33,652 --> 01:14:36,932
- You're right.
- You can't make it easy for her.

879
01:14:37,012 --> 01:14:39,988
Besides, if you don't go with Riza,
what would we do, now we're identical?

880
01:14:40,012 --> 01:14:43,172
You're right. There's no turning back.

881
01:14:44,852 --> 01:14:49,252
I'll go to his rehearsal.
The keys to my house are in your jacket.

882
01:14:50,452 --> 01:14:56,252
Take the suitcase. And you have an
appointment at 5:00 to take some pictures.

883
01:14:57,892 --> 01:14:59,212
Hurry up.

884
01:14:59,772 --> 01:15:03,972
- Melinda, how do I look?
- You look very beautiful, madam.

885
01:15:04,052 --> 01:15:06,892
- Don't I look a bit weird?
- No more than usual.

886
01:15:06,972 --> 01:15:10,732
I have to take some pictures for the album.

887
01:15:10,812 --> 01:15:14,332
Go see your father
and be nice to him. He looks very sad.

888
01:15:14,452 --> 01:15:17,412
My father? But I'm in a hurry,
I haven't got time. I have to do...

889
01:15:17,492 --> 01:15:20,932
- Take him this tea and talk to him.
- Where is he?

890
01:15:21,332 --> 01:15:27,172
- In his office. Third door on the right.
- Of course, the office. Where's my mind?

891
01:15:27,292 --> 01:15:33,452
This girl is incredible! She has no memory! She's
lived here for 20 years and can't find her way!

892
01:15:40,332 --> 01:15:44,852
Dad, you've been here for hours.
Have some tea, it will do you good.

893
01:15:45,932 --> 01:15:47,292
What's wrong?

894
01:15:48,132 --> 01:15:52,212
I've never told anybody,
but I feel frustrated with my job.

895
01:15:52,292 --> 01:15:53,572
Why?

896
01:15:54,492 --> 01:15:57,252
There's no happiness in anything I do.

897
01:15:58,172 --> 01:16:02,772
Mari Carmen, the test-tube girl,
is not normal. She's a monster.

898
01:16:03,692 --> 01:16:05,572
And the parakeets don't sing.

899
01:16:06,252 --> 01:16:10,532
If they don't sing, they aren't perfect.
So I've done an imperfect job.

900
01:16:10,852 --> 01:16:15,612
Let me think. If the birds don't sing,
there are only two possible reasons.

901
01:16:15,732 --> 01:16:22,052
They're either old or sad. And you
just made them, so they can't be old.

902
01:16:22,172 --> 01:16:24,172
In that case, they must be sad.

903
01:16:24,252 --> 01:16:28,852
- And what can I do?
- Give them vitamins and antibiotics.

904
01:16:29,172 --> 01:16:32,612
I happen to have some
here. I'll give it to them.

905
01:16:33,572 --> 01:16:36,532
You might be right. I
hadn't thought of that.

906
01:16:36,612 --> 01:16:40,652
You should take some, too, Dad.
You work too much.

907
01:16:41,292 --> 01:16:46,052
Your psychologist is right when she says
I should get to know you better.

908
01:16:46,132 --> 01:16:50,612
It can't be today. I have to take
some pictures, but if you want,

909
01:16:50,692 --> 01:16:53,468
- tonight we can have dinner together.
- All right. Where shall we go?

910
01:16:53,492 --> 01:16:56,772
- Right here. I'll cook.
- But can you cook?

911
01:16:56,852 --> 01:16:58,332
Very well.

912
01:16:59,572 --> 01:17:02,452
And I don't want to
see you like this when I come back.

913
01:17:07,652 --> 01:17:11,532
It's been a wonderful experience,
but I have to leave you.

914
01:17:12,532 --> 01:17:16,292
What are you saying?
You just recorded the album. How dare you?

915
01:17:16,372 --> 01:17:19,972
It's dangerous for me to stay here,
and it could affect you, too.

916
01:17:20,412 --> 01:17:23,852
- What's he talking about?
- He's always kept things from us.

917
01:17:23,932 --> 01:17:26,452
Yes, I have.

918
01:17:27,732 --> 01:17:32,092
But I want to give you a present before I
leave, so you can buy clothes and records.

919
01:17:32,172 --> 01:17:34,892
- Wicked.
- Wait a moment.

920
01:17:35,092 --> 01:17:37,052
This is not necessary.

921
01:17:39,972 --> 01:17:41,772
- What's this for?
- This?

922
01:17:41,852 --> 01:17:45,132
- For the cover of our album.
- Are you recording an album?

923
01:17:45,212 --> 01:17:46,492
Of course.

924
01:17:47,052 --> 01:17:50,412
- And why did you come here?
- We want to shine like lamps.

925
01:17:50,932 --> 01:17:54,812
You were playing
at Carolina the other day, weren't you?

926
01:17:55,212 --> 01:17:57,932
- Yes, did you see it? How did you like it?
- You were crap.

927
01:17:58,012 --> 01:18:00,052
You're just so rude, darling.

928
01:18:00,572 --> 01:18:04,092
And cheeky as a bitch. I'm going to break
your lamps if you don't shut up.

929
01:18:04,212 --> 01:18:06,572
And I'll make your
face look like a spotlight.

930
01:18:06,892 --> 01:18:09,852
You're just naff.

931
01:18:09,932 --> 01:18:14,092
- Sorry I'm late.
- What's wrong with your voice?

932
01:18:14,292 --> 01:18:16,332
- How do I look?
- I have a bit of a cold.

933
01:18:17,172 --> 01:18:20,532
Kiss her and infect her. She's a bitch.

934
01:18:26,412 --> 01:18:29,132
- Eusebio, look who's here.
- Forget them.

935
01:18:32,172 --> 01:18:34,852
This is great for our living room.

936
01:18:35,932 --> 01:18:40,012
Babe, look at this. It's just too cute!

937
01:18:40,092 --> 01:18:42,812
Pick the one you like.

938
01:18:42,892 --> 01:18:45,012
- Really?
- Really.

939
01:18:46,172 --> 01:18:50,852
I'd like the glass to stand out.

940
01:18:50,972 --> 01:18:52,732
- This...
- It's a bit naff, isn't it?

941
01:18:52,812 --> 01:18:57,652
Maybe a little,
but it doesn't matter. Let it be naff.

942
01:18:57,732 --> 01:19:00,572
As long as it's shiny.

943
01:19:04,972 --> 01:19:08,252
"Riza Niro disappeared from Panama
to live a happy exile in Madrid."

944
01:19:08,332 --> 01:19:14,132
"We will reward the person who
takes us to him. Call 2618430 any time."

945
01:19:15,012 --> 01:19:19,012
Eusebio, they're all so pretty.
I can't make up my mind.

946
01:19:19,092 --> 01:19:21,812
Darling, isn't he that queer, Johnny?

947
01:19:24,252 --> 01:19:25,788
- He looks a bit like him.
- Doesn't he?

948
01:19:25,812 --> 01:19:26,932
Yes.

949
01:19:28,732 --> 01:19:32,812
Isn't this the guy who replaced me?

950
01:19:33,452 --> 01:19:36,892
- Yes, he looks a bit like him.
- Definitely. Why?

951
01:19:37,012 --> 01:19:39,795
- Can you see this? Riza Niro.
- The son of the Emperor of Tiran?

952
01:19:39,852 --> 01:19:42,828
Listen, this says he's the son of the
Emperor of Tiran. The singer from Ellos.

953
01:19:42,852 --> 01:19:45,132
Awesome. This will be great for promotion.

954
01:19:45,252 --> 01:19:47,868
- That's bullshit. It has nothing to do with Riza.
- Look at him.

955
01:19:47,892 --> 01:19:49,372
- Where are they now?
- Rehearsing.

956
01:19:49,452 --> 01:19:51,348
- Look at him.
- Excuse me, is there a telephone here?

957
01:19:51,372 --> 01:19:53,172
- Downstairs.
- My God...

958
01:19:53,252 --> 01:19:55,774
- I have to make a phone call...
- My boyfriend goes first.

959
01:19:55,812 --> 01:19:57,652
- But...
- Let go!

960
01:19:57,732 --> 01:20:01,252
- Come here, bitch. If I catch you... Come here!
- Leave me alone!

961
01:20:03,092 --> 01:20:05,972
You old cow! You're naff!

962
01:20:06,052 --> 01:20:07,852
Your father's naff!

963
01:20:14,452 --> 01:20:19,852
Hello? I'm calling about the advert.
Yes, the Emperor's son sings with a band.

964
01:20:20,372 --> 01:20:22,652
- Who are you?
- The money.

965
01:20:22,812 --> 01:20:26,572
Muslim students. Their name is "Ellos".

966
01:20:27,172 --> 01:20:30,452
They're rehearsing. How much is the reward?

967
01:20:31,612 --> 01:20:35,732
- All right. The address is 220 Warble Street.
- Don't give them the address.

968
01:20:35,932 --> 01:20:38,052
- I'll see you there.
- Eusebio, for God's sake,

969
01:20:38,132 --> 01:20:39,932
how do you intend to collect the reward?

970
01:20:40,012 --> 01:20:42,852
- You're stupid, my love, you're thick. Walk.
- Come on, let's go.

971
01:20:42,932 --> 01:20:44,612
It'll take us forever with your leg.

972
01:20:47,892 --> 01:20:49,092
Hello?

973
01:20:50,372 --> 01:20:53,412
- One second, I'll let them know.
- Do you know if they're rehearsing?

974
01:20:53,492 --> 01:20:57,692
- Yes. Can you tell them they have a call?
- Who is it?

975
01:20:57,772 --> 01:20:59,732
- Hello?
- Is Sexilia around?

976
01:20:59,892 --> 01:21:04,372
- Queti, it's Sexi. What's up?
- Eusebio has called the Muslims about Riza.

977
01:21:04,452 --> 01:21:06,892
- They're on their way. Get out, fast!
- No.

978
01:21:06,972 --> 01:21:09,652
Thanks, I'll tell him right now. Goodbye.

979
01:21:10,412 --> 01:21:14,292
- We have to go to the studio right away.
- But I'm having dinner with my dad.

980
01:21:14,372 --> 01:21:18,132
- With your dad? What's up with him now?
- I had a sudden rush of filial love.

981
01:21:18,252 --> 01:21:21,492
Let's go. Let's go.

982
01:21:23,532 --> 01:21:26,452
You've been discovered!
The Muslims are on their way.

983
01:21:27,332 --> 01:21:29,172
It had to happen sooner or later.

984
01:21:29,252 --> 01:21:30,828
- What are you talking about?
- What's up?

985
01:21:30,852 --> 01:21:34,148
Nothing. I'm the son of the Emperor of
Tiran. And I'm being chased right now.

986
01:21:34,172 --> 01:21:35,532
- Riza Niro?
- Riza Niro?

987
01:21:35,612 --> 01:21:39,452
- Come on, we have no time to spare.
- Why don't we all go to Contadora?

988
01:21:39,532 --> 01:21:42,292
That's it! This money will be enough.
Give me that.

989
01:21:43,292 --> 01:21:44,572
Do you have your passports?

990
01:21:44,652 --> 01:21:45,932
- Yes.
- What a coincidence.

991
01:21:46,012 --> 01:21:47,932
Okay, then, let's go.

992
01:21:48,652 --> 01:21:50,412
And our record? And promotion?

993
01:21:50,492 --> 01:21:55,812
- And our work?
- I've enough money for us all. To the Caribbean!

994
01:22:01,572 --> 01:22:05,252
- Can I come to the airport, if you don't mind?
- To the airport?

995
01:22:06,092 --> 01:22:09,092
You're coming to Contadora
with me, like we had planned.

996
01:22:09,172 --> 01:22:13,612
- Otherwise, I'll stay here and let them catch me.
- No!

997
01:22:16,012 --> 01:22:18,212
- Where are you going so fast?
- To the airport.

998
01:22:18,332 --> 01:22:19,680
But please, don't tell anybody.

999
01:22:37,052 --> 01:22:41,972
I have to hang up. My laxative is taking
effect. I'll call you later, okay? Bye.

1000
01:22:48,292 --> 01:22:50,388
- Where are they?
- They're not here. Let go, I'm crapping myself.

1001
01:22:50,412 --> 01:22:51,772
- Where are they?
- They left.

1002
01:22:51,852 --> 01:22:53,052
- Where?
- To the airport.

1003
01:22:53,132 --> 01:22:54,468
- All of them?
- Yes, all of them.

1004
01:22:54,492 --> 01:22:56,212
- Long ago?
- Yes, yes.

1005
01:22:56,292 --> 01:22:59,652
- Let go!
- I like you. I have no time now, but I'll be back.

1006
01:23:16,812 --> 01:23:19,532
- Paca, are they in there? What's up?
- They left.

1007
01:23:19,612 --> 01:23:21,812
- Where?
- I'll crap myself right here.

1008
01:23:21,932 --> 01:23:25,228
- To the airport. I can't hold it anymore!
- Have you seen some Muslim guys, madam?

1009
01:23:25,252 --> 01:23:29,012
- I don't understand.
- Muslim is like Arab. Dark skin and hair.

1010
01:23:29,132 --> 01:23:31,748
There are very dark and weird people
around here. I can't hold it anymore.

1011
01:23:31,772 --> 01:23:33,492
- Madam, please.
- I can't anymore.

1012
01:23:33,572 --> 01:23:35,772
I can't hold it anymore, let me go in!

1013
01:23:35,852 --> 01:23:40,332
I'm Jaime Roca, from Howmagazine.
I wanted to interview Ellos.

1014
01:23:42,052 --> 01:23:43,812
- Where did they go?
- To the airport.

1015
01:23:43,892 --> 01:23:46,012
- You can go in now.
- To the airport, come on!

1016
01:23:46,132 --> 01:23:47,732
Hurry!

1017
01:23:49,652 --> 01:23:54,092
I wanted to explain everything and apologise.
I used to like boys until I met you.

1018
01:23:54,252 --> 01:23:57,532
You made me forget them,
but my past was torturing me.

1019
01:23:57,652 --> 01:24:02,132
I didn't know if it would work with you.
I tried to explain, but you never let me.

1020
01:24:02,212 --> 01:24:04,948
That doesn't explain the thing with Toraya.
She's not a boy, that I know.

1021
01:24:04,972 --> 01:24:09,172
She came into my room. When she asked me
to have sex with her, I didn't hesitate.

1022
01:24:09,252 --> 01:24:14,092
She was the first woman I had sex with,
but not the love of my life as she said.

1023
01:24:14,212 --> 01:24:16,852
Do you understand it? It was just training.

1024
01:24:18,692 --> 01:24:22,532
I knew you were very experienced,
and I was scared of disappointing you.

1025
01:24:22,892 --> 01:24:26,652
You didn't trust me very much, did you?
I've also been a bit silly.

1026
01:24:27,332 --> 01:24:31,012
- I was a nymphomaniac until I met you.
- I know, I'd heard.

1027
01:24:31,132 --> 01:24:34,492
But that was long ago. Now I only like you.

1028
01:24:35,252 --> 01:24:39,092
But I have to tell you something
very important. It's all Toraya's fault.

1029
01:24:39,172 --> 01:24:40,828
Why? I told you she
has nothing to do with it.

1030
01:24:40,852 --> 01:24:44,012
Your nymphomania and mine.
My phobia for sun and all that.

1031
01:24:44,092 --> 01:24:46,972
- No, I told you I used her.
- Not at all.

1032
01:24:47,052 --> 01:24:50,357
Do you remember 15 years ago, when
you spent the summer on the Costa del Sol?

1033
01:24:51,612 --> 01:24:57,852
Passengers flying to Contadora,
please board through gate number four.

1034
01:25:00,212 --> 01:25:01,652
- To Contadora.
- To Contadora.

1035
01:25:01,892 --> 01:25:04,852
Can't you hear that?
The flight will depart in five minutes.

1036
01:25:04,932 --> 01:25:06,868
- Can we buy tickets here?
- Over there, I don't know.

1037
01:25:06,892 --> 01:25:08,412
Come on.

1038
01:25:09,612 --> 01:25:11,532
Christ! Poofs!

1039
01:25:15,852 --> 01:25:19,092
I can smell him. Over here. Now!

1040
01:25:25,732 --> 01:25:27,252
To the Caribbean!

1041
01:25:28,052 --> 01:25:31,028
- If they took a plane, where would they go?
- To Contadora, of course.

1042
01:25:31,052 --> 01:25:32,172
Of course.

1043
01:25:32,692 --> 01:25:35,812
- Are there any flights to Panama?
- Yes, it's taking off right now.

1044
01:25:35,932 --> 01:25:38,732
- Call the pilot. They can't take off.
- Why?

1045
01:25:39,572 --> 01:25:42,212
- There's a bomb.
- Well, I'm afraid you're late.

1046
01:25:42,292 --> 01:25:45,332
- And some passengers have infectious diseases.
- Yes.

1047
01:25:45,412 --> 01:25:48,508
Leave me alone. People know what they're
exposed to when they board on a plane.

1048
01:25:48,532 --> 01:25:51,572
- We have to get into that plane.
- You should have come earlier.

1049
01:25:55,572 --> 01:25:57,932
Have you seen four trendy girls?

1050
01:25:58,012 --> 01:25:59,988
- Very beautiful girls.
- One was wearing glasses.

1051
01:26:00,012 --> 01:26:01,828
- They went to Panama. What's up?
- Panama?

1052
01:26:01,852 --> 01:26:05,388
- One of them is the son of the Emperor of Tiran.
- Sure, and I'm Genoveffa di Brabante.

1053
01:26:05,412 --> 01:26:07,852
Go pull your mother's leg, bastard!

1054
01:26:07,932 --> 01:26:10,692
- Wanker!
- Did the four of them leave, or only one?

1055
01:26:10,772 --> 01:26:13,052
They're all on the plane!

1056
01:26:13,172 --> 01:26:16,612
And there's a bomb, and some passengers
with infectious diseases, too.

1057
01:26:16,732 --> 01:26:18,828
- Anything else?
- I won't forgive Angel for this.

1058
01:26:18,852 --> 01:26:20,308
- He stood me up again.
- I won't forgive Gonzalo.

1059
01:26:20,332 --> 01:26:22,372
Where are those Muslims? Have they come?

1060
01:26:22,492 --> 01:26:26,492
Look where they are. To my left.
Come on, say something to them.

1061
01:26:26,572 --> 01:26:28,852
It can't be them. They're from Madrid.

1062
01:26:28,932 --> 01:26:32,532
- Did you get back together with Gonzalo?
- Yes, months ago, but...

1063
01:26:32,612 --> 01:26:35,788
Sexi and you were in such a mood, and I
was afraid you'd kick me out of the band.

1064
01:26:35,812 --> 01:26:40,212
The truth is that I'm back with Angel, too.
But do you know what I'm going to do?

1065
01:26:40,412 --> 01:26:44,452
Eusebio, don't you see
they're very dark, almost Arab-like?

1066
01:26:44,532 --> 01:26:46,812
- It's them.
- It can't be them.

1067
01:26:46,932 --> 01:26:50,212
- If you don't talk to them, I will.
- Shut up.

1068
01:26:50,292 --> 01:26:54,172
- Shut up at once.
- And if I don't go, what are we doing?

1069
01:26:54,492 --> 01:26:58,332
- Madam, madam.
- Mute!

1070
01:26:58,412 --> 01:27:03,492
Did you get any questions
from a tall, dark boy, with an Arab look?

1071
01:27:03,572 --> 01:27:06,292
- Do you want to know why they left?
- Yes, hello.

1072
01:27:06,412 --> 01:27:08,692
I'm Jaime Roca
and I was supposed to interview him.

1073
01:27:08,812 --> 01:27:10,092
I'm his manager.

1074
01:27:10,172 --> 01:27:12,212
- Where is he?
- They went to Panama.

1075
01:27:12,532 --> 01:27:15,812
- Damn! This is bad luck.
- We're always late for everything.

1076
01:27:15,932 --> 01:27:20,612
- Oh my, she's Toraya. Are you Toraya?
- I'm Princess Toraya.

1077
01:27:20,732 --> 01:27:23,012
She's Empress Toraya.

1078
01:27:23,452 --> 01:27:27,132
Perfect, that's exactly what we need.
Go out and park the car.

1079
01:27:27,252 --> 01:27:30,772
Would you mind taking some photos
with my beautiful girls?

1080
01:27:30,892 --> 01:27:33,852
- Please.
- I don't want to.

1081
01:27:33,932 --> 01:27:37,212
They sing and they'll be very famous.
Just a few photos.

1082
01:27:38,692 --> 01:27:41,252
Are you the Muslims?

1083
01:27:41,332 --> 01:27:44,052
- And you're the one we talked to on the phone.
- Yes.

1084
01:27:44,132 --> 01:27:46,332
- What's up with the money?
- Nothing.

1085
01:27:47,172 --> 01:27:50,852
How do you mean?
It's not my fault that Niro has left.

1086
01:27:50,972 --> 01:27:53,092
So give me the money, come on.

1087
01:27:55,052 --> 01:27:58,492
Shut up and watch out. We'll be around.

1088
01:28:02,212 --> 01:28:05,052
- Eusebio, did you get angry?
- No.

1089
01:28:05,772 --> 01:28:09,532
- Those guys have...
- What are you talking about?

1090
01:28:09,932 --> 01:28:14,052
- Those Muslim guys who were here.
- Muslims? The ones I told you?

1091
01:28:14,492 --> 01:28:18,092
Eusebio, you're so good
that sometimes you're stupid.

1092
01:28:18,212 --> 01:28:19,412
Everybody fools you.

1093
01:28:19,532 --> 01:28:24,532
This is a huge mess. You know nothing about
it, so we can talk outside if you want.

1094
01:28:24,612 --> 01:28:27,132
- Goodbye, girls.
- Goodbye, Princess.

1095
01:28:27,452 --> 01:28:29,572
- What's up?
- So you were hanging out with them?

1096
01:28:29,652 --> 01:28:32,412
- And you notice now? You're a little slow.
- With my ideas

1097
01:28:32,492 --> 01:28:35,732
and this story, you'll get huge promotion.

1098
01:28:35,812 --> 01:28:38,732
Look, I'm fed up with you playing
with our feelings, you know?

1099
01:28:38,812 --> 01:28:43,292
Stars have no feelings, darling. Remember
that, because you can't afford them.

1100
01:28:43,372 --> 01:28:46,892
First I'm a woman, and then I'm a star.
And so are you, right? Tell him.

1101
01:28:46,972 --> 01:28:52,172
Come on,
sometimes I really like being a star.

1102
01:28:52,612 --> 01:28:59,252
- It's a pity we were so late for the interview.
- Don't worry. You'll soon have huge news.

1103
01:28:59,332 --> 01:29:02,412
- What's it about?
- You'll know soon.

1104
01:29:02,932 --> 01:29:04,132
My wallet!

1105
01:29:04,812 --> 01:29:06,852
I think my wallet has been stolen!

1106
01:29:06,932 --> 01:29:10,292
- One second, Princess. I'll be right back.
- I have everything, thanks.

1107
01:29:10,372 --> 01:29:13,532
Excuse me, madam.
I have a present for you from Riza Niro.

1108
01:29:13,612 --> 01:29:15,132
- From Riza Niro?
- Yes.

1109
01:29:15,212 --> 01:29:18,268
- You weren't alone before, so I didn't tell you.
- Thanks. Where is it?

1110
01:29:18,292 --> 01:29:20,252
- Come with me.
- Of course.

1111
01:29:20,332 --> 01:29:21,948
- Come on, fast.
- Yes, it's just here.

1112
01:29:21,972 --> 01:29:23,772
- Is it? Thanks.
- Yes.

1113
01:29:27,172 --> 01:29:31,092
I knew he couldn't leave just like that.

1114
01:29:33,292 --> 01:29:36,252
Help! Help!

1115
01:29:43,292 --> 01:29:44,692
Susana was right.

1116
01:29:45,652 --> 01:29:49,412
How could I dare talk about sex
if I didn't know what it was?

1117
01:29:49,732 --> 01:29:52,492
You won't believe this,
but I feel the same.

1118
01:29:55,292 --> 01:29:58,452
- Hello?
- Hello, Sexilia. How are you?

1119
01:29:58,932 --> 01:30:02,372
Hello, Susana. I'm sorry to cut you off,
but I'm in bed with my father.

1120
01:30:02,452 --> 01:30:04,052
In bed? Are you kidding me?

1121
01:30:04,132 --> 01:30:08,332
Not at all. You were right
when you said I'm in love with him.

1122
01:30:08,412 --> 01:30:11,052
Your father hates sex,
I know that. He told me.

1123
01:30:11,132 --> 01:30:14,732
You're wrong.
Sex problems in this family are over.

1124
01:30:14,852 --> 01:30:17,492
Put me through to him, please.
I want to apologise.

1125
01:30:17,572 --> 01:30:20,572
- You went too far at the cafe.
- Pass him the phone, please.

1126
01:30:21,492 --> 01:30:24,132
Susana, leave us alone,
and stop being a pain.

1127
01:30:24,212 --> 01:30:28,652
I am a great friend,
but I can be even better an enemy.

1128
01:31:00,652 --> 01:31:04,972
- The passengers will hear us.
- Don't worry, they're all sleeping.

1129
01:31:06,172 --> 01:31:08,532
- Isn't it better if we do it in the toilet?
- No!

1130
01:31:08,652 --> 01:31:11,212
We'll do it here, like in Emmanuelle I.

1131
01:31:11,492 --> 01:31:15,972
Darling! You're the first man
I've shagged in-flight!
