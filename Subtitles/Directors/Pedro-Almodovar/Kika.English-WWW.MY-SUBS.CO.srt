1
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:40,501
Claudia.

2
00:01:40,626 --> 00:01:41,626
Yes?

3
00:01:41,751 --> 00:01:43,042
Relax.

4
00:01:43,626 --> 00:01:46,876
I'm relaxed.
Say it again and I'll snore.

5
00:01:47,001 --> 00:01:50,917
Go ahead,
it's a sign of inner peace.

6
00:01:51,042 --> 00:01:54,834
Is this a lingerie
or a sleeping pill ad?

7
00:01:55,376 --> 00:01:56,459
Sleeping lingerie.

8
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:01,542
I wanna see your face enjoying.

9
00:02:01,667 --> 00:02:04,667
Very good. That's right...

10
00:02:07,459 --> 00:02:10,959
More! We're making love!

11
00:02:11,792 --> 00:02:14,001
Chin down. Very well.

12
00:02:16,251 --> 00:02:17,376
Fuck!

13
00:02:19,834 --> 00:02:21,959
Once more!

14
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,917
Let's try again.

15
00:04:23,001 --> 00:04:24,001
Mother!

16
00:04:46,167 --> 00:04:47,251
Where's mother?

17
00:04:47,376 --> 00:04:50,084
In the bathroom.
This time she got away with it.

18
00:05:29,751 --> 00:05:31,501
My wife committed suicide.

19
00:05:32,251 --> 00:05:33,876
She shot herself.

20
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:37,334
I tried to stop her,
but she shot me in the arm.

21
00:05:38,751 --> 00:05:40,792
Hurry, please.

22
00:05:42,917 --> 00:05:47,251
Kilometre 20 on the A2 on the right.
Casa Youkali.

23
00:05:47,376 --> 00:05:51,167
My wife named it after Kurt Weill,

24
00:05:51,709 --> 00:05:53,376
the German musician.

25
00:05:53,501 --> 00:05:56,626
Never mind!
Come quick, please!

26
00:06:04,042 --> 00:06:04,959
Here,

27
00:06:06,209 --> 00:06:07,834
she left this note for you.

28
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:17,834
Dear Ram칩n,

29
00:06:19,001 --> 00:06:20,209
I'm leaving.

30
00:06:21,834 --> 00:06:24,626
You won't understand.
I hope you never will.

31
00:06:25,417 --> 00:06:30,001
It would mean
you're as desperate as I am.

32
00:06:30,626 --> 00:06:33,209
Would you mind helping me
stop the haemorrhage?

33
00:06:35,376 --> 00:06:36,626
I'm still alive.

34
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:43,459
<i>THREE YEARS LATER</i>

35
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:01,334
Lower your head, open your eye.
See?

36
00:07:01,459 --> 00:07:04,876
We left an eyelash
so you notice the difference.

37
00:07:05,001 --> 00:07:10,334
It widens the eye,
gives depth, expression, shape.

38
00:07:10,459 --> 00:07:14,792
A girl with almond-shaped eyes is better
than one with a spaniel eye.

39
00:07:16,584 --> 00:07:19,376
Even the most banal woman

40
00:07:19,834 --> 00:07:22,751
looks intelligent and sparkling
with lashes.

41
00:07:22,876 --> 00:07:24,751
Eyelashes are great.
I'm all for them!

42
00:07:24,876 --> 00:07:25,959
Hail the eyelashes!

43
00:07:27,542 --> 00:07:29,292
The Marquise called,

44
00:07:29,417 --> 00:07:30,626
she needs someone
to make up her mother.

45
00:07:30,751 --> 00:07:31,667
The dead one?

46
00:07:31,792 --> 00:07:33,834
She wants the body
to be presentable for the wake.

47
00:07:34,417 --> 00:07:36,542
I'll fix the other one in a sec.

48
00:07:36,667 --> 00:07:39,917
I can't, I'm meeting Ram칩n
to pick up his stepfather.

49
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:41,584
Always thinking of yourself.

50
00:07:41,709 --> 00:07:43,876
Send one of them.
Here's the address.

51
00:07:44,001 --> 00:07:48,167
It's a rush. I gave my word
and don't want to look bad.

52
00:07:49,084 --> 00:07:52,917
Why'd you give your word
without consulting me?

53
00:07:53,042 --> 00:07:55,542
- Bye, darling.
- Bye.

54
00:07:56,792 --> 00:08:00,876
Would you make up
the poor Marquise's dead mother?

55
00:08:01,001 --> 00:08:01,917
Me?

56
00:08:02,459 --> 00:08:03,542
Ask her to go.

57
00:08:03,667 --> 00:08:05,584
Why me? She asked you!

58
00:08:05,709 --> 00:08:08,126
Gives me the creeps.

59
00:08:08,709 --> 00:08:09,834
Why don't you go together?

60
00:08:10,292 --> 00:08:12,709
I make artists up!
I won't make up someone dead.

61
00:08:13,167 --> 00:08:16,876
I made up a dead man once
and got great results.

62
00:08:17,001 --> 00:08:20,876
It was two years ago.
I worked in TV with Amparo

63
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:22,709
and was making up Nicholas Pierce,

64
00:08:23,334 --> 00:08:25,292
an American writer.

65
00:08:26,251 --> 00:08:29,501
There you go.
Now some powder...

66
00:08:34,084 --> 00:08:35,709
Want something special?

67
00:08:35,834 --> 00:08:36,959
No, thank you.

68
00:08:37,084 --> 00:08:39,501
Can you please sign my book then?

69
00:08:39,626 --> 00:08:41,792
- Right away.
- My name is Kika.

70
00:08:50,584 --> 00:08:55,126
I like you very much, Kika.
My number is...

71
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:06,001
<i>YOU HAVE TO READ MORE</i>

72
00:09:10,751 --> 00:09:11,709
Ready?

73
00:09:13,542 --> 00:09:18,959
This afternoon,
our guest is Nicholas Prisse,

74
00:09:19,084 --> 00:09:21,876
American journalist and writer,

75
00:09:22,001 --> 00:09:26,667
who's just published
his first novel in Spanish.

76
00:09:27,209 --> 00:09:32,042
"I fell in love with a fraud"

77
00:09:33,167 --> 00:09:36,126
I don't know if I said it well.

78
00:09:36,251 --> 00:09:37,501
Pierce.

79
00:09:37,626 --> 00:09:42,834
I have trouble saying foreign names.

80
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,626
Have some chorizo!

81
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:45,751
No, thank you.

82
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:49,542
It's from La Mancha, like me.
It's delicious!

83
00:09:51,084 --> 00:09:54,001
Have you lived in Spain long?

84
00:09:54,876 --> 00:09:58,167
Four years.
I came to write a piece on hunting,

85
00:09:59,251 --> 00:10:04,167
I write about it
in American magazines.

86
00:10:04,292 --> 00:10:06,792
I fell in love with your country,

87
00:10:06,917 --> 00:10:11,209
in particular with a woman I married,
and stayed.

88
00:10:11,334 --> 00:10:14,084
There's nowhere like Spain!

89
00:10:15,584 --> 00:10:20,876
In the prologue,
you warn evil-minded people

90
00:10:21,001 --> 00:10:24,626
that this novel is not autobiographical.

91
00:10:25,501 --> 00:10:29,751
No, but I admit some things
are inspired by my life.

92
00:10:30,542 --> 00:10:32,334
I was going to say that.

93
00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:35,126
For instance, your wife,
may she rest in peace,

94
00:10:35,876 --> 00:10:38,251
died, like the one in the novel.

95
00:10:39,126 --> 00:10:43,167
Her husband, in the book,
is a writer like you.

96
00:10:43,292 --> 00:10:44,251
Yes.

97
00:10:44,376 --> 00:10:47,876
Among writers there's a tradition
of killing wives.

98
00:10:48,334 --> 00:10:50,084
Really? I didn't know.

99
00:10:50,792 --> 00:10:53,376
William Burroughs shot his wife.

100
00:10:53,501 --> 00:10:56,001
Louis Althusser strangled his.

101
00:10:56,126 --> 00:10:57,209
How terrible!

102
00:10:57,334 --> 00:11:00,959
I don't know them.
They're not Spanish, are they?

103
00:11:03,209 --> 00:11:05,001
You wouldn't kill your wife...

104
00:11:05,834 --> 00:11:08,084
No, but people suspected it.

105
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:10,459
People are bad.

106
00:11:10,584 --> 00:11:14,751
In fact,
these suspicions inspired my book.

107
00:11:14,876 --> 00:11:21,001
I asked myself, if I would've killed
my wife, how could I have tricked the police?

108
00:11:21,126 --> 00:11:23,001
The answer is in this book.

109
00:11:24,042 --> 00:11:26,959
I don't think I'll read it.

110
00:11:27,084 --> 00:11:32,667
My eyesight is bad because I've got
diabetes something chronic.

111
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:35,667
But I'll give it
to my grandchildren to read.

112
00:11:36,417 --> 00:11:37,667
Many thanks.

113
00:11:38,501 --> 00:11:42,501
To wrap, what are your future plans?

114
00:11:43,001 --> 00:11:47,917
I'm off to Latin America,
to write about the area.

115
00:11:48,501 --> 00:11:52,501
So, have a safe trip, and good luck.

116
00:11:52,626 --> 00:11:57,459
Find a woman.
Marry her so you won't be alone.

117
00:11:57,584 --> 00:11:59,126
You're still young.

118
00:12:00,084 --> 00:12:02,501
I'll take your advice, Do침a Paquita.

119
00:12:03,001 --> 00:12:07,542
I'm a widow too.

120
00:12:08,542 --> 00:12:11,376
You can't imagine
how ugly solitude can be.

121
00:12:12,126 --> 00:12:15,876
Dark days, endless nights.

122
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:20,042
My son directs this programme

123
00:12:20,167 --> 00:12:24,334
and called me to "represent" it,

124
00:12:24,459 --> 00:12:29,542
so I can be with him,
since he can't visit me.

125
00:12:30,251 --> 00:12:32,209
I love Do침a Paquita!

126
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:34,792
If my mother lived,
I'd like her to be like her.

127
00:12:34,917 --> 00:12:38,501
I like him better.
As a father, I mean.

128
00:12:38,626 --> 00:12:43,834
Though Amparo was brash,
I left with Nicholas.

129
00:12:43,959 --> 00:12:45,334
We hit it off

130
00:12:46,751 --> 00:12:49,126
and made another date.

131
00:12:49,251 --> 00:12:51,542
I remember it like today,
it was freezing.

132
00:12:51,667 --> 00:12:55,834
I wore a sheep acrylic orange coat,
looked terrific.

133
00:13:01,626 --> 00:13:03,001
Thanks for coming.

134
00:13:04,001 --> 00:13:06,292
What's wrong?
Aren't you glad to see me?

135
00:13:07,126 --> 00:13:09,042
My son died last night.

136
00:13:09,167 --> 00:13:12,876
I'm sorry!
I didn't even know you had a son.

137
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:14,751
He was my wife's son.

138
00:13:14,876 --> 00:13:15,917
Oh, just a stepson...

139
00:13:17,251 --> 00:13:21,876
I rang you to make him up.
He'll start decomposing soon.

140
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:23,834
You should have told me!

141
00:13:23,959 --> 00:13:27,501
I thought bringing
my make-up case was a pretext to...

142
00:13:28,001 --> 00:13:28,959
Well, you know...

143
00:13:29,084 --> 00:13:31,126
I couldn't imagine
I had to make up a corpse!

144
00:13:31,251 --> 00:13:33,709
You'll do just fine.
Come on.

145
00:13:33,834 --> 00:13:35,876
Is he wounded? I hate wounds.

146
00:13:36,001 --> 00:13:38,292
No wounds,
he had a cardiac arrest.

147
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:40,667
During Christmas. Poor boy!

148
00:13:40,792 --> 00:13:42,584
You're alone? Where's the family?

149
00:13:46,834 --> 00:13:49,251
What an unusual headboard!

150
00:13:49,376 --> 00:13:53,167
He was a photographer
and a collage artist.

151
00:13:53,292 --> 00:13:56,959
What a beautiful corpse!
What was his name?

152
00:13:57,459 --> 00:13:58,376
Ram칩n.

153
00:14:00,876 --> 00:14:01,876
He's cold.

154
00:14:02,001 --> 00:14:02,959
Of course.

155
00:14:03,167 --> 00:14:04,501
I'm frozen too.

156
00:14:04,626 --> 00:14:09,501
Get rid of the pallor
before we take him to the morgue.

157
00:14:10,251 --> 00:14:14,251
Don't worry.
I'll try and give him his natural colour.

158
00:14:14,376 --> 00:14:15,376
That's it.

159
00:14:15,917 --> 00:14:17,501
Well, I'll leave you two alone.

160
00:14:21,292 --> 00:14:24,167
I see you liked women a lot.

161
00:14:25,709 --> 00:14:27,917
If you would've met me,

162
00:14:28,042 --> 00:14:29,792
you might've fallen in love with me.

163
00:14:31,126 --> 00:14:32,167
Me with you,

164
00:14:33,459 --> 00:14:34,376
surely.

165
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:38,751
I haven't been very selective, Ram칩n.

166
00:14:39,501 --> 00:14:41,501
I've shacked up in the worst joints.

167
00:14:42,126 --> 00:14:45,584
I wonder what's with me,
I always get the weirdos.

168
00:14:45,709 --> 00:14:50,876
A good heart and a good dick
and I fall in love.

169
00:14:51,001 --> 00:14:54,959
I can't help them.
I try, but I don't get them.

170
00:14:57,001 --> 00:14:58,251
Your stepfather

171
00:14:58,376 --> 00:14:59,876
is another ball-game.

172
00:15:00,001 --> 00:15:01,584
He's so strange...

173
00:15:02,042 --> 00:15:06,042
But he's American and a writer.

174
00:15:06,167 --> 00:15:08,751
Great in bed though, very sexy.

175
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:11,251
He called me today.

176
00:15:12,167 --> 00:15:13,751
I came here thinking
I was going to get laid.

177
00:15:13,917 --> 00:15:16,292
Honestly, I mean...

178
00:15:16,834 --> 00:15:21,834
I'm making up a corpse.
That's okay 'cause I like you,

179
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:23,042
but then

180
00:15:24,167 --> 00:15:26,042
I don't know if I'll get laid or not.

181
00:15:28,251 --> 00:15:32,667
There's no atmosphere,
no wake, no family, no...

182
00:15:32,792 --> 00:15:35,251
I don't see a deadly atmosphere.

183
00:15:35,917 --> 00:15:39,167
It all seems very American to me.

184
00:15:52,001 --> 00:15:53,459
He's getting warm.

185
00:15:55,876 --> 00:15:56,792
What's wrong?

186
00:15:56,917 --> 00:15:59,667
Something strange,
the skin is getting red.

187
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:00,876
What skin?

188
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:02,042
Ram칩n's.

189
00:16:02,167 --> 00:16:03,251
That's impossible.

190
00:16:03,376 --> 00:16:05,126
Maybe he's allergic to make-up.

191
00:16:05,251 --> 00:16:07,084
Dead people don't have allergies.

192
00:16:07,209 --> 00:16:11,001
I swear, I'm not lying.
His skin's got colour!

193
00:16:12,626 --> 00:16:15,001
Doesn't he have better colour?

194
00:16:15,126 --> 00:16:16,626
Must be the make-up.

195
00:16:16,751 --> 00:16:20,084
No, I just made up this side.

196
00:16:21,126 --> 00:16:23,876
Keep going.
I'll stay with you.

197
00:16:46,876 --> 00:16:48,292
He's alive!

198
00:16:51,792 --> 00:16:53,334
Do you feel better?

199
00:16:53,459 --> 00:16:54,626
Much better!

200
00:16:54,751 --> 00:16:56,667
You gave us a big fright!

201
00:17:43,792 --> 00:17:46,376
- How are you, Ram칩n?
- Fine, and you?

202
00:17:46,501 --> 00:17:47,459
Fine.

203
00:17:48,334 --> 00:17:49,584
Let me help you.

204
00:17:49,709 --> 00:17:50,667
Thanks.

205
00:17:51,376 --> 00:17:52,917
What have you done all this time?

206
00:17:53,042 --> 00:17:55,459
Contributing to "Field and Stream",

207
00:17:55,584 --> 00:17:59,251
but basically bummed around,
which is what I like best.

208
00:17:59,376 --> 00:18:04,084
Could you lend me
some money for a few days?

209
00:18:04,209 --> 00:18:06,292
I don't even have enough for the hotel.

210
00:18:07,001 --> 00:18:08,084
Of course.

211
00:18:10,001 --> 00:18:11,209
I could live in Casa Youkali,

212
00:18:11,792 --> 00:18:13,709
but I'd have to rent a car.

213
00:18:13,834 --> 00:18:17,501
The house in unliveable.
No worries, I'll lend you the money.

214
00:18:17,626 --> 00:18:19,709
Thanks. I promise to return it.

215
00:18:19,834 --> 00:18:21,084
What will you do in Madrid?

216
00:18:21,209 --> 00:18:23,834
Work. What else!
I have lots of ideas.

217
00:18:23,959 --> 00:18:27,417
I'll write a novel inspired
by Latin America.

218
00:18:27,542 --> 00:18:31,876
And you?
How's your heart? You taking care?

219
00:18:32,001 --> 00:18:33,501
I'm perfectly fine.

220
00:18:33,626 --> 00:18:34,709
I'm delighted.

221
00:18:38,001 --> 00:18:40,292
- Sorry I'm late!
- What happened?

222
00:18:40,959 --> 00:18:42,876
- You look terrific.
- So do you.

223
00:18:43,001 --> 00:18:46,376
Lack of responsibility,
nothing suits me better.

224
00:18:46,501 --> 00:18:47,751
He's so cheeky!

225
00:18:50,417 --> 00:18:55,376
A woman sets herself on fire
in a bank director's office,

226
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:59,376
after having been refused a loan.

227
00:18:59,501 --> 00:19:05,126
A member of the Bishop's Court
tried for misdemeanour.

228
00:19:05,251 --> 00:19:09,667
Juana T. reported to have been object
of "indecent proposals"

229
00:19:09,792 --> 00:19:12,042
while trying to get her marriage annulled.

230
00:19:12,167 --> 00:19:17,542
Military commander kills his wife,
then commits suicide.

231
00:19:17,667 --> 00:19:21,584
Argument began over
daughter's bad grades in school.

232
00:19:21,709 --> 00:19:26,167
His neighbours described him
as an enchanting man.

233
00:19:26,292 --> 00:19:29,251
Rapist commits suicide in jail

234
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:33,501
incapable of facing the shame
of being repeatedly raped

235
00:19:33,626 --> 00:19:35,792
by various prisoners.

236
00:19:35,917 --> 00:19:38,542
Angel Maya,
condemned to four years of jail

237
00:19:38,667 --> 00:19:42,251
for prostituting invalids.

238
00:19:42,376 --> 00:19:47,584
Five skinheads slay
two Moroccans and one Dominican.

239
00:19:47,709 --> 00:19:52,584
Child prostitution and porn video racket

240
00:19:52,709 --> 00:19:54,792
discovered in a Madrid kindergarten.

241
00:19:54,917 --> 00:19:58,917
Children's ages vary from three to six.

242
00:19:59,042 --> 00:20:00,917
Whereabouts still unknown

243
00:20:01,042 --> 00:20:05,001
of parricide Joaqu칤n Garc칤a.

244
00:20:05,126 --> 00:20:08,126
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

245
00:20:08,251 --> 00:20:11,001
With you, Andrea Scarface,

246
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:14,709
presenting, exclusively,
"Today's Worst".

247
00:20:22,792 --> 00:20:27,667
Before presenting our first guest,

248
00:20:27,792 --> 00:20:29,959
a review of footage
I filmed one month ago.

249
00:20:30,084 --> 00:20:35,292
Warning: it'll shock your sensibility,
if you still have any.

250
00:20:39,167 --> 00:20:41,626
Why did your daughter kill herself?

251
00:20:41,751 --> 00:20:43,042
Leave me alone.

252
00:20:43,167 --> 00:20:46,251
Was she happy?
How was her family environment?

253
00:20:46,376 --> 00:20:49,834
It was hell!
It was my husband's fault.

254
00:20:50,292 --> 00:20:51,876
He raped her.

255
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:53,376
Did you report him?

256
00:20:53,501 --> 00:20:57,751
We wanted him to leave us alone,
stop making our life impossible.

257
00:20:57,876 --> 00:21:00,126
We're separating.

258
00:21:01,709 --> 00:21:03,001
What're you doing here?

259
00:21:35,417 --> 00:21:39,626
Despite the police's efforts,

260
00:21:39,751 --> 00:21:42,626
Joaqu칤n Garc칤a still runs free.

261
00:21:42,751 --> 00:21:47,501
Our sponsor, Royal Milk,

262
00:21:47,626 --> 00:21:51,626
offers a 10 million pesetas reward

263
00:21:51,751 --> 00:21:55,209
to whoever gives a viable tip
of his whereabouts.

264
00:21:55,334 --> 00:21:58,709
Please, abstain from calling

265
00:21:58,834 --> 00:22:00,959
if unsure of information.

266
00:22:01,792 --> 00:22:04,542
Since we cannot, at this time,

267
00:22:04,667 --> 00:22:07,167
speak with Joaqu칤n Garc칤a,

268
00:22:07,292 --> 00:22:08,292
tonight

269
00:22:08,417 --> 00:22:11,584
we'll do it with the woman
who knows him best.

270
00:22:12,459 --> 00:22:13,584
His mother.

271
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:17,584
She deserves it.

272
00:22:18,959 --> 00:22:20,584
Good evening, Angelina.

273
00:22:21,334 --> 00:22:22,334
Nervous?

274
00:22:23,292 --> 00:22:24,209
A little.

275
00:22:24,417 --> 00:22:25,542
Good.

276
00:22:25,667 --> 00:22:28,292
Tell me,
so the public can be aware...

277
00:22:28,417 --> 00:22:32,417
Your son killed his wife
and raped his daughter.

278
00:22:33,001 --> 00:22:37,417
Did he have abnormal instincts
as a child?

279
00:22:37,542 --> 00:22:40,542
Did he try to kill you,
perhaps rape you

280
00:22:40,667 --> 00:22:41,917
at any time?

281
00:22:44,459 --> 00:22:48,542
He was a good child.

282
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:51,417
A bit of a rascal,
but I never thought he'd get to this.

283
00:22:51,542 --> 00:22:55,126
I'm his mother and
I don't think he did it.

284
00:22:55,251 --> 00:22:58,209
He didn't?
You know I have it on film.

285
00:22:58,334 --> 00:22:59,626
Well, I don't believe it.

286
00:22:59,751 --> 00:23:01,042
No?

287
00:23:01,167 --> 00:23:05,084
His wife cannot agree with you
because she lies in the cemetery.

288
00:23:10,084 --> 00:23:11,292
Dear Ram칩n,

289
00:23:11,417 --> 00:23:12,709
I'm leaving.

290
00:23:12,834 --> 00:23:15,834
You won't understand.
And hope you never will.

291
00:23:15,959 --> 00:23:19,709
It would mean
you're as desperate as I am.

292
00:23:20,501 --> 00:23:22,042
Don't blame Nicholas.

293
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:26,334
Life with him is unbearable,
but I don't want another.

294
00:23:26,959 --> 00:23:29,126
Don't bear him a grudge.

295
00:23:29,584 --> 00:23:32,709
Forgive me for not having cared
enough about you,

296
00:23:32,834 --> 00:23:34,792
but pain makes you selfish,

297
00:23:34,917 --> 00:23:36,126
it absorbs you totally.

298
00:23:36,251 --> 00:23:37,959
What are you doing?

299
00:23:38,626 --> 00:23:41,459
Wondering whether Mother
wanted me to help Nicholas.

300
00:23:41,584 --> 00:23:44,667
She didn't want you
to bear him a grudge.

301
00:23:44,792 --> 00:23:48,209
I feel uncomfortable knowing
he's penniless in a hotel,

302
00:23:48,334 --> 00:23:50,584
though he brought it onto himself.

303
00:23:51,084 --> 00:23:55,584
Mind if I move him upstairs?
A few weeks, till he finds something.

304
00:23:55,709 --> 00:23:59,251
Of course not!
And your studio?

305
00:24:00,042 --> 00:24:02,209
I'll rent a room and move.

306
00:24:03,042 --> 00:24:04,126
That's a good idea.

307
00:24:08,834 --> 00:24:10,042
Oh, the chest!

308
00:24:10,167 --> 00:24:11,792
I'll move it out.

309
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:13,542
No, I like it.

310
00:24:14,042 --> 00:24:16,167
I'll move my things today.

311
00:24:16,876 --> 00:24:18,459
This is your room.

312
00:24:18,584 --> 00:24:21,376
The bathroom's in there.
Not very luxurious...

313
00:24:22,167 --> 00:24:24,334
I've been in worst places.

314
00:24:25,084 --> 00:24:28,042
At some point
we should discuss Casa Youkali.

315
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:30,792
Youkali's the only thing I have.

316
00:24:30,917 --> 00:24:33,751
Half of Youkali, you mean.

317
00:24:33,876 --> 00:24:35,084
Yes, of course.

318
00:24:36,376 --> 00:24:37,584
You don't use it.

319
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:39,084
Pass the other one.

320
00:24:39,792 --> 00:24:41,834
Think we should sell it?

321
00:24:42,376 --> 00:24:45,126
I don't know.
Let me think it over.

322
00:24:45,876 --> 00:24:47,501
You know how much it's worth!

323
00:24:49,334 --> 00:24:52,917
I don't think of money
when I think of Youkali.

324
00:24:53,417 --> 00:24:57,542
I can't afford the luxury
of being sentimental. I'm not rich.

325
00:25:27,042 --> 00:25:28,292
What do you want?

326
00:25:28,792 --> 00:25:31,459
Nicholas! It's Andrea!

327
00:25:31,584 --> 00:25:33,626
I thought you were a Martian.

328
00:25:33,751 --> 00:25:35,376
Don't blame you.
Nice to see you!

329
00:25:35,501 --> 00:25:36,417
Come in.

330
00:25:36,667 --> 00:25:38,792
- What're you doing here?
- I saw the ad.

331
00:25:38,917 --> 00:25:41,751
- Want to buy the house?
- I'm not that rich.

332
00:25:41,876 --> 00:25:45,334
I'm looking for this sort of house
to film my programme.

333
00:25:45,459 --> 00:25:47,542
I'm no longer a psychologist.

334
00:25:47,667 --> 00:25:49,542
I direct a TV programme now.

335
00:25:49,667 --> 00:25:50,626
That's a change.

336
00:25:50,751 --> 00:25:52,751
Not really.
I'm still surrounded by crazies.

337
00:25:52,876 --> 00:25:53,834
And very pleased!

338
00:25:55,042 --> 00:25:56,501
Mind if I film?

339
00:25:56,626 --> 00:26:00,126
Film what you want,
but Ram칩n makes the decisions.

340
00:26:00,251 --> 00:26:01,876
I'm expecting him.

341
00:26:02,459 --> 00:26:03,834
Have you seen him?

342
00:26:03,959 --> 00:26:06,501
All I have left of us is this scar.

343
00:26:08,376 --> 00:26:09,667
I like the garden.

344
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:13,376
The story I want to shoot is
of a couple who killed ten people

345
00:26:13,501 --> 00:26:17,126
and discreetly buried them in the garden.

346
00:26:17,251 --> 00:26:19,334
This place is as isolated as ever.

347
00:26:19,459 --> 00:26:21,751
Like to read the first chapter?
I have it.

348
00:26:21,876 --> 00:26:22,834
It's not necessary.

349
00:26:22,959 --> 00:26:26,042
Yes, please.
Read it and give me your opinion.

350
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:27,334
Alright.

351
00:26:27,459 --> 00:26:29,167
I'm going to look around.

352
00:26:34,917 --> 00:26:37,042
The place is perfect.

353
00:26:37,167 --> 00:26:39,084
Need to fix it a little over there.

354
00:26:39,751 --> 00:26:41,709
How'd you like the script?

355
00:26:41,834 --> 00:26:42,751
It's rubbish.

356
00:26:42,876 --> 00:26:43,959
I know.

357
00:26:44,959 --> 00:26:47,001
I have an idea,
why don't you write it?

358
00:26:47,126 --> 00:26:48,167
Me?

359
00:26:48,292 --> 00:26:49,959
I never wrote for TV.

360
00:26:50,084 --> 00:26:52,126
You're a writer, that's enough.

361
00:26:52,251 --> 00:26:54,251
My Spanish is too poor to write.

362
00:26:54,376 --> 00:26:58,292
Write in English and we'll translate it.

363
00:26:59,667 --> 00:27:02,209
By the way,
don't tell Ram칩n about this.

364
00:27:02,334 --> 00:27:03,376
Alright.

365
00:27:04,542 --> 00:27:06,042
Andrea, what are you doing here?

366
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:09,542
I came to see the house.
To rent it.

367
00:27:09,667 --> 00:27:11,417
It's for sale, not for rent.

368
00:27:11,542 --> 00:27:15,709
I thought you'd like to make money
till you found a buyer.

369
00:27:15,834 --> 00:27:18,667
You thought wrong.
Goodbye, Andrea.

370
00:27:23,459 --> 00:27:26,501
Ram칩n, walk me to the gate?

371
00:27:26,626 --> 00:27:28,459
I'd like to talk to you.

372
00:27:28,584 --> 00:27:30,209
You know the way.

373
00:27:32,751 --> 00:27:34,709
Bye Nicholas, glad to see you.

374
00:27:37,959 --> 00:27:39,876
When the fuck will she leave me alone?

375
00:27:40,001 --> 00:27:42,667
You shouldn't have mistreated her.
Some women like it.

376
00:27:42,792 --> 00:27:45,709
I never mistreated her,
I fled from her.

377
00:27:45,834 --> 00:27:48,417
And the scar? She says you did it.

378
00:27:48,542 --> 00:27:53,001
She did it.
Cut her face to stop me from leaving.

379
00:27:53,126 --> 00:27:55,001
Interesting girl...

380
00:28:35,042 --> 00:28:36,251
Here, Ram칩n.

381
00:28:36,376 --> 00:28:41,459
Your heart medicine, hypertension pills
and for your willy.

382
00:28:41,584 --> 00:28:43,084
I have to rush.

383
00:28:43,667 --> 00:28:46,126
I have three shows.

384
00:28:46,251 --> 00:28:48,459
Models get impossible
if I don't make them up.

385
00:28:48,584 --> 00:28:49,876
I have a gift for you.

386
00:28:50,001 --> 00:28:51,126
What is it?

387
00:28:51,251 --> 00:28:53,084
What a beautiful thing!

388
00:28:53,917 --> 00:28:54,959
A ring...

389
00:28:55,084 --> 00:28:58,001
It's beautiful.
Why go through the trouble!

390
00:28:58,126 --> 00:29:00,626
We've lived together for two years now.

391
00:29:00,751 --> 00:29:04,167
It's true, sorry.
I don't even know what day it is!

392
00:29:04,292 --> 00:29:06,667
I'm also asking you to marry me.

393
00:29:07,126 --> 00:29:08,334
To marry you?

394
00:29:08,459 --> 00:29:09,417
Don't you want to?

395
00:29:09,584 --> 00:29:12,792
It's not that,
you caught me off-guard.

396
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:15,167
Aren't I too old for you?

397
00:29:15,292 --> 00:29:17,251
I like older women.

398
00:29:17,376 --> 00:29:18,792
Too immature for my age?

399
00:29:18,917 --> 00:29:20,667
I like immature women.

400
00:29:22,126 --> 00:29:25,042
You asked for it!
I love the ring.

401
00:29:25,167 --> 00:29:26,542
Shall we celebrate tonight?

402
00:29:26,667 --> 00:29:30,917
Let's have dinner and all the works.
Everything you want!

403
00:29:36,751 --> 00:29:38,667
What are you doing here?

404
00:29:38,792 --> 00:29:40,667
I came to take you to breakfast.

405
00:29:40,792 --> 00:29:41,834
Dressed like this?

406
00:29:41,959 --> 00:29:45,751
It's hot out!
Think I overdid it?

407
00:29:45,876 --> 00:29:48,501
Don't be surprised
if they ask "how much".

408
00:29:48,626 --> 00:29:50,709
I didn't hear that.

409
00:29:50,834 --> 00:29:53,959
I know you didn't mean it,
you're just jealous.

410
00:29:54,084 --> 00:29:58,584
I'm worried about you.
You've been very tense.

411
00:29:58,709 --> 00:30:00,292
Is it that obvious?

412
00:30:00,417 --> 00:30:02,209
To me it is, I know you.

413
00:30:02,334 --> 00:30:05,167
Ram칩n suspects something,
he's asked me to marry him.

414
00:30:05,292 --> 00:30:08,126
That's great news!

415
00:30:08,251 --> 00:30:11,959
I think it's odd,

416
00:30:12,084 --> 00:30:14,376
just now that our relationship
is not exactly at its best.

417
00:30:14,501 --> 00:30:16,876
You have a wonderful relationship.

418
00:30:17,001 --> 00:30:21,584
How many men marry you
after two years?

419
00:30:21,709 --> 00:30:24,626
It's a nice gesture,
but maybe he suspects something.

420
00:30:24,751 --> 00:30:26,834
If he suspects, the more the merit.

421
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:30,459
Sweetie, though I'm younger,

422
00:30:30,584 --> 00:30:32,876
I'm more developed up here.

423
00:30:33,001 --> 00:30:35,876
If there's a problem,
the solution isn't screwing Nicholas.

424
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:37,209
Don't say that!

425
00:30:37,334 --> 00:30:41,376
You said no one's eaten your pussy
or fucked you like him.

426
00:30:41,501 --> 00:30:44,084
It was a lie,
Ram칩n eats it just as well.

427
00:30:45,042 --> 00:30:48,251
Why doubt then? Marry Ram칩n
and stop fooling around with Nicholas.

428
00:30:48,376 --> 00:30:49,459
You're so basic!

429
00:30:49,584 --> 00:30:51,626
And he's loaded. What more?

430
00:30:55,417 --> 00:30:57,792
She pressed Nick's buzzer.

431
00:30:57,917 --> 00:30:58,834
Think so?

432
00:31:02,584 --> 00:31:03,626
Susana!

433
00:31:04,167 --> 00:31:05,376
What are you doing here?

434
00:31:06,126 --> 00:31:07,126
I expected a messenger.

435
00:31:08,126 --> 00:31:09,417
Well, it's me.

436
00:31:09,542 --> 00:31:11,042
May I come in?

437
00:31:12,126 --> 00:31:14,126
I've looked for you for months.

438
00:31:14,667 --> 00:31:16,001
How'd you find me?

439
00:31:16,126 --> 00:31:18,084
By chance.

440
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:20,167
Saw your picture in a TV guide.

441
00:31:20,292 --> 00:31:21,792
Didn't know you wrote

442
00:31:21,917 --> 00:31:23,667
or that your name was Nicholas.

443
00:31:23,792 --> 00:31:25,126
I know so little about you...

444
00:31:25,709 --> 00:31:28,334
You have a lot to explain.

445
00:31:30,626 --> 00:31:31,834
As you like.

446
00:31:31,959 --> 00:31:33,042
Come in.

447
00:31:50,876 --> 00:31:52,709
I'm exhausted, Juana.
Is Ram칩n home?

448
00:31:52,834 --> 00:31:53,751
Not yet.

449
00:31:53,876 --> 00:31:57,167
I'll run upstairs then.
I'm so tired...

450
00:31:57,292 --> 00:31:58,251
Don't pull that face.

451
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:00,292
Sorry, it's the only one I've got.

452
00:32:00,417 --> 00:32:03,167
Can't expect all women to be dykes.

453
00:32:03,292 --> 00:32:04,709
It's no shame.

454
00:32:04,834 --> 00:32:08,542
Neither is being crazy about men.

455
00:32:09,501 --> 00:32:12,584
By the way,
it's not my business,

456
00:32:12,709 --> 00:32:15,084
but have you thought
of shaving your moustache?

457
00:32:15,209 --> 00:32:16,126
Why?

458
00:32:17,084 --> 00:32:19,126
Men don't have a monopoly
on moustaches.

459
00:32:20,334 --> 00:32:23,709
Men with moustaches are either
gay, fascist or both.

460
00:32:23,834 --> 00:32:27,042
Speaking as a professional,
you'd be prettier without.

461
00:32:27,167 --> 00:32:28,834
You'd pick up more.

462
00:32:30,084 --> 00:32:32,167
I'll make you up,
you'll see the change.

463
00:32:32,292 --> 00:32:34,834
I'm going upstairs, I'm exhausted.

464
00:32:36,876 --> 00:32:39,751
She's so mistaken, but so charming.

465
00:32:55,334 --> 00:32:57,376
Nick, it's Kika.
Pick up if you're in.

466
00:32:58,334 --> 00:33:00,376
I have to talk to you.

467
00:33:00,501 --> 00:33:05,417
Ram칩n asked me to marry him.
Let's talk about it.

468
00:33:06,292 --> 00:33:07,417
You're not there.

469
00:33:08,209 --> 00:33:10,459
Well, see you tomorrow.

470
00:33:10,584 --> 00:33:12,667
I'm dead today, I'm exhausted.

471
00:33:15,792 --> 00:33:16,876
There we are.

472
00:33:17,584 --> 00:33:21,251
Look at you, don't you look great?

473
00:33:21,376 --> 00:33:22,584
Do you like me better?

474
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:24,126
No comparison.

475
00:33:24,709 --> 00:33:29,126
Now they like models with weird faces,
you could be one of them.

476
00:33:29,251 --> 00:33:33,042
I don't see myself on the catwalk.
I want to be a prison matron,

477
00:33:34,209 --> 00:33:35,834
surrounded by girls all day!

478
00:33:35,959 --> 00:33:37,376
You're too much, Juana!

479
00:33:37,501 --> 00:33:39,501
- I'm authentic!
- That's true.

480
00:33:40,751 --> 00:33:42,001
What's wrong?

481
00:33:42,126 --> 00:33:43,917
You've gotten me excited.

482
00:33:44,042 --> 00:33:45,542
Juana, really!

483
00:33:46,209 --> 00:33:48,834
I need some water,
to cool off the erection.

484
00:33:50,417 --> 00:33:52,376
Have you ever been with a man?

485
00:33:53,834 --> 00:33:55,584
Well, just with my brother.

486
00:33:55,709 --> 00:33:57,084
You've committed incest?

487
00:33:57,209 --> 00:33:59,959
Don't know if it was incest,
he was abnormal.

488
00:34:00,084 --> 00:34:02,084
- Poor thing.
- Well, he is.

489
00:34:02,667 --> 00:34:05,376
Like all abnormals, he liked to fuck.

490
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:07,667
Not just abnormals do.

491
00:34:07,792 --> 00:34:12,834
At first he did it with cows,
sheep and all the lambs in the village.

492
00:34:12,959 --> 00:34:17,167
Then in the neighbourhood.

493
00:34:17,292 --> 00:34:20,876
Before he raped the neighbours,
I let him screw me so he could steam off.

494
00:34:21,001 --> 00:34:23,876
If that's the case,
it probably wasn't incest.

495
00:34:24,001 --> 00:34:26,542
But that's why you're traumatized.

496
00:34:26,667 --> 00:34:27,834
I'm not traumatized!

497
00:34:27,959 --> 00:34:30,959
Nothing compares to good pussy.

498
00:34:31,084 --> 00:34:32,959
Just because you haven't tried.

499
00:34:33,084 --> 00:34:34,334
You're really asinine!

500
00:34:34,459 --> 00:34:35,501
I'm authentic!

501
00:34:36,876 --> 00:34:38,709
Pay Juana a compliment.

502
00:34:39,417 --> 00:34:41,251
Juana, you look beautiful.

503
00:34:41,751 --> 00:34:43,876
The se침ora disguised me.

504
00:34:44,001 --> 00:34:45,376
I forgot to tell you...

505
00:34:47,584 --> 00:34:50,292
Nicholas is moving to Youkali soon.

506
00:34:50,417 --> 00:34:51,959
Weren't you selling it?

507
00:34:52,084 --> 00:34:55,626
Until we do, he's better off there.
Great place for writing.

508
00:34:55,751 --> 00:34:57,542
It's very messy.

509
00:34:57,667 --> 00:34:59,709
We'll clean it up.

510
00:34:59,834 --> 00:35:03,209
Do you want to keep him far from us?

511
00:35:03,334 --> 00:35:05,917
Since you're asking... Yes.

512
00:35:06,459 --> 00:35:08,417
- Is it because...?
- I can't forget.

513
00:35:09,501 --> 00:35:10,417
Your mother?

514
00:35:12,209 --> 00:35:13,626
Yes.

515
00:35:14,876 --> 00:35:17,334
You can't keep torturing
yourself with her death.

516
00:35:17,459 --> 00:35:21,292
I'm an orphan and don't spend all day
turning it in my head.

517
00:35:21,417 --> 00:35:23,084
- It's not the same.
- How come!

518
00:35:24,167 --> 00:35:26,917
You were small when your parents died.

519
00:35:27,042 --> 00:35:28,084
And that makes it a small loss?

520
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:29,751
Try to understand!

521
00:35:29,876 --> 00:35:32,251
I never stop, but you don't...

522
00:35:32,376 --> 00:35:37,792
With time, couples resemble each other,
but we're more and more different.

523
00:35:37,917 --> 00:35:40,542
I'm always chattier,
you're more hermetic.

524
00:35:40,667 --> 00:35:41,584
That's not good.

525
00:35:41,751 --> 00:35:45,667
I read introverted people
interiorize their emotions

526
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:49,542
like anger or self-contempt.

527
00:35:49,667 --> 00:35:51,876
This interiorizing produces cancer.

528
00:35:52,001 --> 00:35:53,709
You don't know the agony of cancer...

529
00:35:53,834 --> 00:35:54,959
Enough already!

530
00:35:55,584 --> 00:35:56,959
You don't let me talk!

531
00:35:57,084 --> 00:35:58,917
You're the one who doesn't let me!

532
00:36:00,084 --> 00:36:02,292
So go ahead, talk!

533
00:36:03,001 --> 00:36:04,501
About what?

534
00:36:04,626 --> 00:36:09,292
Lots... I don't mean Sarajevo,
Somalia and stuff.

535
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:10,334
I mean about you and me.

536
00:36:11,084 --> 00:36:13,126
Wasn't this going to be a party?

537
00:36:13,251 --> 00:36:17,626
I forgot!
I get out of hand if you don't control me.

538
00:36:18,584 --> 00:36:21,667
That can't be,
I need lots of control!

539
00:36:25,626 --> 00:36:27,334
Dab yourself, brings luck.

540
00:36:28,876 --> 00:36:31,667
Behind your ears!

541
00:36:34,167 --> 00:36:35,584
To us.

542
00:36:35,709 --> 00:36:37,709
Whatever happens,
let's keep loving each other.

543
00:36:37,834 --> 00:36:39,626
But let's hope nothing happens.

544
00:36:42,417 --> 00:36:47,084
This week,
our popular section "Bloody Ceremonies"

545
00:36:47,209 --> 00:36:50,584
had the pleasure to travel
to Villaverde de los Ojos

546
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:54,792
where every year
the Picaos procession is held.

547
00:37:34,667 --> 00:37:36,126
How disgusting!

548
00:38:01,334 --> 00:38:04,292
Even Juana, who's so coarse,
is affected.

549
00:38:10,834 --> 00:38:15,959
In the masked group of repentants
was Pablo Mendez,

550
00:38:16,084 --> 00:38:19,459
better known by his stage name,
Paul Bazzo.

551
00:38:19,584 --> 00:38:21,501
Remember "Dickotherapy"

552
00:38:22,001 --> 00:38:24,126
and "Spill the sperm"?

553
00:38:24,834 --> 00:38:26,709
That's Paul Bazzo!

554
00:38:26,834 --> 00:38:29,917
Famous porn actor was serving time

555
00:38:30,042 --> 00:38:33,084
for crimes against public health.

556
00:38:33,209 --> 00:38:37,126
Jail authorities granted him a permit

557
00:38:37,251 --> 00:38:41,626
to fulfil a promise to his village Saint.

558
00:38:41,751 --> 00:38:43,417
Once masked,

559
00:38:43,542 --> 00:38:47,001
he took advantage of the confusion
to escape.

560
00:38:57,876 --> 00:39:01,292
Due to the low IQ
of this famous porn actor,

561
00:39:01,417 --> 00:39:04,334
ex-boxer and ex-legionnaire,

562
00:39:04,459 --> 00:39:07,126
one supposes his freedom
will be short-lived.

563
00:39:10,417 --> 00:39:12,334
Let's do it the way I like.

564
00:39:12,459 --> 00:39:14,584
Seriously, this has got to change.

565
00:39:14,709 --> 00:39:19,626
Do it as a gift.
I gave you a ring...

566
00:39:19,751 --> 00:39:21,917
It's my fault for encouraging this habit.

567
00:39:22,042 --> 00:39:25,459
I don't mind,
I'm a liberal woman.

568
00:39:25,584 --> 00:39:28,834
But once in a while
I'd like to do it the conventional way.

569
00:39:31,876 --> 00:39:33,126
Look at me!

570
00:39:37,834 --> 00:39:39,917
Shall I go on?

571
00:39:50,917 --> 00:39:51,834
Finished?

572
00:39:51,959 --> 00:39:53,376
No, one more.

573
00:39:57,251 --> 00:39:59,792
Take one of me enjoying myself.

574
00:40:06,584 --> 00:40:09,042
Again, in case it's out of focus.

575
00:40:09,876 --> 00:40:12,584
It will be 'cause you don't stop moving.

576
00:40:14,001 --> 00:40:16,542
No, that looks fake.

577
00:40:31,876 --> 00:40:33,334
You're not enjoying it?

578
00:40:34,001 --> 00:40:37,876
I don't know.
Can't concentrate with all these photos.

579
00:40:38,001 --> 00:40:41,834
No more photos then.
Now concentrate.

580
00:40:41,959 --> 00:40:43,834
I'm concentrating.

581
00:40:52,001 --> 00:40:53,084
The lamp,

582
00:40:54,001 --> 00:40:55,001
it's moving.

583
00:40:55,459 --> 00:40:58,167
Look, it's moving.

584
00:40:58,292 --> 00:41:00,251
We can stop if you want.

585
00:41:00,376 --> 00:41:01,876
You don't mind?

586
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:04,334
Why should I mind?

587
00:41:04,834 --> 00:41:06,542
Don't be angry.

588
00:41:06,667 --> 00:41:08,376
We took lots of photos.

589
00:43:05,584 --> 00:43:07,917
Nicholas, pick up, it's Andrea.

590
00:43:09,334 --> 00:43:10,251
Come on, pick up,

591
00:43:10,376 --> 00:43:11,917
I know you're there.

592
00:43:13,501 --> 00:43:17,001
What you sent today
weren't the scripts.

593
00:43:17,126 --> 00:43:19,292
It was the draft of a novel.

594
00:43:19,417 --> 00:43:21,709
I hate people who say
I know you're there.

595
00:43:22,334 --> 00:43:23,542
Me too.
Am I disturbing?

596
00:43:24,001 --> 00:43:25,584
Yes.
What do you want?

597
00:43:25,709 --> 00:43:29,834
Instead of the chapters,

598
00:43:29,959 --> 00:43:33,876
you sent something with a terrible title,
"A Lesbian Killer".

599
00:43:35,542 --> 00:43:37,542
I mixed the envelopes up.

600
00:43:41,542 --> 00:43:43,292
Wait.

601
00:43:47,459 --> 00:43:49,709
Yours is here, sorry.

602
00:43:51,501 --> 00:43:52,917
Will you send them tomorrow?

603
00:43:54,251 --> 00:43:55,917
You can have them now.

604
00:43:56,042 --> 00:44:00,126
Tomorrow I'm moving to Youkali.

605
00:44:00,792 --> 00:44:02,042
Should I come to you?

606
00:44:04,251 --> 00:44:07,751
I'll see you at the Bellas Artes
in half an hour.

607
00:44:08,834 --> 00:44:10,834
An hour's better.

608
00:44:18,292 --> 00:44:20,834
Killing is like cutting your toe nails.

609
00:44:21,292 --> 00:44:24,084
At first,
thinking about it makes you lazy.

610
00:44:24,209 --> 00:44:29,084
When you cut them, you discover
it's quicker than you imagined.

611
00:44:29,542 --> 00:44:33,042
You think a long time will pass
before doing it again.

612
00:44:33,167 --> 00:44:34,626
But when you least expect it,

613
00:44:34,751 --> 00:44:36,876
they've grown again.

614
00:44:38,542 --> 00:44:40,501
What a wonderful paragraph!

615
00:44:41,376 --> 00:44:45,209
You can't define more precisely
the natural passion to kill.

616
00:44:46,959 --> 00:44:48,376
Only one objection.

617
00:44:48,501 --> 00:44:51,917
A woman is narrating,
and even though a lesbian,

618
00:44:52,042 --> 00:44:56,001
a woman is never lazy about
her personal grooming.

619
00:44:56,126 --> 00:44:57,251
You're right.

620
00:44:58,834 --> 00:45:02,084
Could you postpone your novel
while you finish my work?

621
00:45:02,209 --> 00:45:03,959
We're a little behind

622
00:45:04,084 --> 00:45:07,001
and I still have to translate it
into Spanish.

623
00:45:07,126 --> 00:45:10,001
I promise I'll work hard at Youkali.

624
00:45:10,876 --> 00:45:12,792
Is this based on true events?

625
00:45:14,001 --> 00:45:17,042
It's loosely based
on various unresolved cases.

626
00:45:18,084 --> 00:45:22,209
They all had in common lack of motive.
I read them in the paper.

627
00:45:23,417 --> 00:45:26,667
It wasn't the same person,
or necessarily a woman,

628
00:45:26,792 --> 00:45:29,709
it's a license I've taken
to give it more bite.

629
00:45:29,834 --> 00:45:33,667
You don't need it, it's fantastic.
What more do you want?

630
00:45:34,792 --> 00:45:36,751
Talking about that love bite...

631
00:45:36,876 --> 00:45:38,626
Today in my office,

632
00:45:38,751 --> 00:45:40,792
an incredible woman
came asking for you.

633
00:45:41,251 --> 00:45:42,667
She sounded Mexican.

634
00:45:42,792 --> 00:45:45,001
She came to my house afterwards.

635
00:45:45,667 --> 00:45:50,167
Be more discreet,
don't give my address to whoever asks.

636
00:45:50,292 --> 00:45:53,209
She was pretty,
I thought you'd like her.

637
00:45:53,334 --> 00:45:56,667
If I want to meet pretty girls,
I'll find them myself.

638
00:45:56,792 --> 00:45:57,876
I'm sorry.

639
00:45:58,501 --> 00:45:59,667
Did she cause trouble?

640
00:45:59,792 --> 00:46:03,001
No, but it took me
an hour to get rid of her.

641
00:46:20,959 --> 00:46:23,501
<i>PAUL BAZZO RAN AWAY FROM JAIL</i>

642
00:46:33,959 --> 00:46:36,042
Who are you, what do you want?

643
00:46:37,209 --> 00:46:38,584
It's me, Pablo.

644
00:46:38,709 --> 00:46:39,834
Why are you here?

645
00:46:39,959 --> 00:46:40,917
I escaped.

646
00:46:41,042 --> 00:46:42,334
Why'd you come here?

647
00:46:42,459 --> 00:46:43,626
Where else?

648
00:46:43,751 --> 00:46:44,709
Come in, idiot.

649
00:46:45,001 --> 00:46:47,584
I told you not to escape
till your time was up!

650
00:46:47,709 --> 00:46:49,792
Jail is so tough. It's not for me.

651
00:46:49,917 --> 00:46:51,667
What will I do with you?

652
00:46:51,792 --> 00:46:53,001
Can't I stay a few days?

653
00:46:53,126 --> 00:46:55,501
You can't stay!
What'll I tell the se침ores?

654
00:46:55,626 --> 00:46:56,959
The truth, I'm your brother!

655
00:46:57,084 --> 00:46:59,001
You're crazy!
They'll report us to the cops.

656
00:46:59,126 --> 00:47:02,459
No, not the cops.
Give me some dough and I'll split.

657
00:47:06,292 --> 00:47:07,626
I don't have more.

658
00:47:07,751 --> 00:47:09,292
I'm thinking...

659
00:47:10,209 --> 00:47:11,792
You'll steal something.

660
00:47:11,917 --> 00:47:12,917
The chair?

661
00:47:13,042 --> 00:47:14,417
What do you need the chair for!

662
00:47:14,542 --> 00:47:16,542
Because you said so...

663
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:18,626
Tie me up and gag me.

664
00:47:18,751 --> 00:47:21,792
Go to the se침or's office,
behind the columns,

665
00:47:21,917 --> 00:47:23,042
to the right.

666
00:47:23,667 --> 00:47:26,709
Grab what you can.
Video cameras, cameras...

667
00:47:27,292 --> 00:47:29,001
Only go in the study.

668
00:47:29,126 --> 00:47:31,334
What did I say?

669
00:47:31,459 --> 00:47:32,376
Steal something.

670
00:47:32,501 --> 00:47:33,501
Where?

671
00:47:35,542 --> 00:47:38,334
In the study, behind the columns,
to the right.

672
00:47:38,459 --> 00:47:39,501
Done.

673
00:47:43,459 --> 00:47:46,626
Put everything in the bag,
I'll try to sell them.

674
00:47:46,751 --> 00:47:48,917
Then you'll go to cousin Reme's.

675
00:47:49,042 --> 00:47:50,084
I'll call to tell her

676
00:47:50,209 --> 00:47:51,667
to hide you a few days.

677
00:47:53,876 --> 00:47:55,501
Stop eating!

678
00:47:55,626 --> 00:47:56,876
Didn't eat yesterday.

679
00:47:57,001 --> 00:47:59,376
If you hadn't escaped,
you wouldn't be hungry.

680
00:47:59,501 --> 00:48:01,876
Where will you get
better assistance than jail?

681
00:48:02,001 --> 00:48:03,167
There's no girls in jail.

682
00:48:03,292 --> 00:48:04,542
There are faggots, aren't there?

683
00:48:04,709 --> 00:48:05,751
It's not the same.

684
00:48:05,876 --> 00:48:08,834
Not the same!
He wants it all!

685
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:11,126
Tie me up and punch me.

686
00:48:13,084 --> 00:48:14,626
Don't hit hard, OK?

687
00:48:15,792 --> 00:48:18,709
Why should I tie you up?
Are you into sadism?

688
00:48:18,834 --> 00:48:20,334
God, are you dumb!

689
00:48:20,459 --> 00:48:23,751
Once they discover the theft,
they won't think I helped.

690
00:48:23,876 --> 00:48:25,417
You got some brain!

691
00:48:25,542 --> 00:48:28,501
And you have none!
C'mon, gag.

692
00:48:28,626 --> 00:48:31,834
- What?
- Napkin on the mouth, gag, tight!

693
00:48:35,459 --> 00:48:37,626
Take it off!

694
00:48:38,542 --> 00:48:40,292
Don't make noise,
the se침ora's asleep.

695
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:41,917
There's a se침ora sleeping?

696
00:48:42,042 --> 00:48:44,376
I see what you're aiming at.
Are you horny?

697
00:48:45,334 --> 00:48:47,167
Tonight you'll screw me and steam off.

698
00:48:47,292 --> 00:48:48,626
- Twice.
- Fine.

699
00:48:48,751 --> 00:48:49,709
Plus Reme.

700
00:48:49,834 --> 00:48:51,626
- We'll see.
- And the little girl.

701
00:48:51,751 --> 00:48:53,584
Leave the little girl out of this!

702
00:48:53,709 --> 00:48:55,209
Don't go in there!

703
00:48:55,709 --> 00:48:56,751
I'll call the cops!

704
00:48:56,876 --> 00:48:58,251
No, fine, don't worry.

705
00:48:58,376 --> 00:49:01,084
Gag me and punch me already!

706
00:49:02,042 --> 00:49:05,417
I wonder what they taught you in jail...

707
00:49:05,542 --> 00:49:06,626
Quiet, Juana.

708
00:49:11,334 --> 00:49:12,459
Ready?

709
00:49:43,667 --> 00:49:45,626
Fuck!

710
00:49:59,542 --> 00:50:01,334
Delicious.

711
00:50:24,376 --> 00:50:25,542
Look at this.

712
00:50:32,001 --> 00:50:34,542
Check the muscle. What do you think?

713
00:50:39,334 --> 00:50:41,751
God, I'm knackered.

714
00:51:12,167 --> 00:51:13,959
I behaved, didn't rape.

715
00:51:15,917 --> 00:51:17,542
Juana, wake up.

716
00:51:17,667 --> 00:51:20,917
We have to go to Reme's,
you promised two fucks.

717
00:51:21,417 --> 00:51:23,459
Don't pretend you're asleep.

718
00:51:27,001 --> 00:51:28,542
She won't awake...

719
00:51:56,626 --> 00:51:57,876
Hey, that's me!

720
00:52:12,626 --> 00:52:14,084
Stop messing.

721
00:52:55,209 --> 00:52:56,792
What are you doing?

722
00:52:56,917 --> 00:52:58,834
Fucking.

723
00:53:00,959 --> 00:53:03,292
Don't call her, she won't answer!

724
00:53:04,251 --> 00:53:08,751
- What?
- Did you kill her?

725
00:53:08,876 --> 00:53:14,001
No, she's unconscious,
gagged and tied to a chair.

726
00:53:14,126 --> 00:53:16,126
Leave me alone!

727
00:53:16,251 --> 00:53:18,626
Stay still!

728
00:53:19,417 --> 00:53:22,292
Would you rather I rape you
or slit your throat?

729
00:53:23,376 --> 00:53:24,917
Spread your legs.

730
00:53:28,917 --> 00:53:30,584
Careful with the knife.

731
00:53:33,751 --> 00:53:35,501
You're Paul Bazzo, right?

732
00:53:35,626 --> 00:53:38,042
Yes, the famous porn actor.

733
00:53:38,167 --> 00:53:39,292
I'm Kika.

734
00:53:39,417 --> 00:53:40,834
How ya doin'?

735
00:53:42,834 --> 00:53:44,292
Careful with the knife.

736
00:53:44,417 --> 00:53:47,292
What you're doing is very bad.

737
00:53:47,417 --> 00:53:50,751
I'm the best!
They always told me on my films.

738
00:53:50,876 --> 00:53:54,667
This isn't a film,
this is an authentic rape.

739
00:53:54,792 --> 00:53:57,667
It's the best!

740
00:53:57,792 --> 00:54:01,292
You must have a lot of problems.

741
00:54:01,417 --> 00:54:02,792
None at all.

742
00:54:02,917 --> 00:54:06,917
You escaped the jail!
I read it and saw it on TV.

743
00:54:09,417 --> 00:54:13,792
Why don't you stop what you're doing?
Let's talk.

744
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:16,001
You'll tell me your problems.

745
00:54:16,126 --> 00:54:19,251
I'm a woman of the world,
very liberal.

746
00:54:19,876 --> 00:54:23,917
And very discreet,
I won't tell.

747
00:54:24,042 --> 00:54:24,959
Okay?

748
00:54:25,626 --> 00:54:27,959
Stop drooling on me!

749
00:54:29,042 --> 00:54:30,251
I'm talking to you!

750
00:54:30,376 --> 00:54:33,042
Leave me alone!

751
00:54:33,167 --> 00:54:35,417
Move the knife!

752
00:54:39,167 --> 00:54:40,501
Damn!

753
00:54:57,209 --> 00:54:58,167
Hello, police.

754
00:54:58,292 --> 00:55:03,792
Quick, they're raping a woman,
Calle Sevilla 3, 6th floor.

755
00:55:03,917 --> 00:55:06,084
How do you know? You the rapist?

756
00:55:07,084 --> 00:55:08,876
So why are you changing your voice?

757
00:55:09,001 --> 00:55:12,959
I'm a voyeur,
I'm watching from my terrace.

758
00:55:13,834 --> 00:55:14,834
A voyeur! Name, number!

759
00:55:14,959 --> 00:55:17,917
Alejandro Mu침oz, Calle Orense, 23.

760
00:55:18,042 --> 00:55:19,959
Think I believe that, arsehole?

761
00:55:20,084 --> 00:55:24,792
He looks like Paul Bazzo
and is pointing a knife to her throat.

762
00:55:24,917 --> 00:55:29,376
Did you get the address?
Calle Sevilla 3, 6th floor.

763
00:55:31,542 --> 00:55:34,126
Fine, wiseguy.
See if you get raped too.

764
00:55:35,417 --> 00:55:36,709
What's up?

765
00:55:36,834 --> 00:55:39,709
A crazy says
he's watching Bazzo rape some girl.

766
00:55:40,292 --> 00:55:43,001
People hallucinate!
Did he say where?

767
00:55:46,667 --> 00:55:47,709
Let's check it out.

768
00:55:48,959 --> 00:55:49,959
Surely a lie.

769
00:55:52,001 --> 00:55:54,417
That's why,

770
00:55:55,209 --> 00:55:56,792
we'll take a walk
and kill the morning.

771
00:55:58,834 --> 00:56:01,001
I'm in no mood for hassle.

772
00:56:02,417 --> 00:56:05,251
How I notice the passing of time!

773
00:56:05,376 --> 00:56:06,334
Don't you?

774
00:56:08,751 --> 00:56:13,417
Think I should put some
collagen on my jowls?

775
00:56:14,042 --> 00:56:15,292
Just a touch.

776
00:56:16,792 --> 00:56:19,626
I have everything else,
including the dimple.

777
00:56:21,042 --> 00:56:24,542
Know what it costs
to have one done in USA?

778
00:56:24,667 --> 00:56:26,042
Ten dollars!

779
00:56:26,167 --> 00:56:28,126
But not like this one.

780
00:56:28,251 --> 00:56:31,792
Only Kirk Douglas and I have one alike.

781
00:56:33,001 --> 00:56:35,209
Stop that nonsense.
Let's go hunt rapists.

782
00:56:37,751 --> 00:56:38,792
Listen.

783
00:56:40,667 --> 00:56:42,792
Haven't you had enough
with two orgasms?

784
00:56:43,751 --> 00:56:45,792
My record is four, without pulling out.

785
00:56:45,917 --> 00:56:48,292
But today I'll beat it!

786
00:56:48,417 --> 00:56:50,667
Why do you have to beat it with me?

787
00:56:53,751 --> 00:56:57,709
One thing's a rape, this is something else.
It's taking all day...

788
00:56:57,834 --> 00:57:00,292
I have to blow my nose, take a pee...
What do I do!

789
00:57:08,751 --> 00:57:12,751
I don't like this.

790
00:57:21,292 --> 00:57:22,292
Put the knife down!

791
00:57:22,417 --> 00:57:24,292
Keep quiet!

792
00:57:24,417 --> 00:57:26,126
One more thing...

793
00:57:26,251 --> 00:57:29,042
You're just out of jail.
You're not sick, are you?

794
00:57:29,501 --> 00:57:32,459
I don't suppose you had
the courtesy of wearing a condom...

795
00:57:32,584 --> 00:57:36,626
The least you can do if you rape
right and left is wear one.

796
00:57:38,001 --> 00:57:39,876
I'm up to here with dick!

797
00:57:57,709 --> 00:57:59,751
Leave the se침ora alone,
you son of a bitch!

798
00:58:00,376 --> 00:58:01,292
Go to the kitchen!

799
00:58:01,417 --> 00:58:04,042
Don't go!
Come closer, I'll untie you.

800
00:58:04,876 --> 00:58:06,959
I saw that! Want me to jab you?

801
00:58:08,376 --> 00:58:13,001
We can't do anything.
Relax and let him come.

802
00:58:13,126 --> 00:58:15,084
He came twice without pulling.

803
00:58:15,209 --> 00:58:16,126
Twice already?

804
00:58:16,251 --> 00:58:17,834
Says his record is four.

805
00:58:17,959 --> 00:58:21,209
It's Paul Bazzo,
the porn actor who escaped.

806
00:58:21,334 --> 00:58:24,084
I see.
We're dealing with a professional.

807
00:58:24,959 --> 00:58:26,126
Paul, can you hear me?

808
00:58:26,834 --> 00:58:28,376
She's talking to you!

809
00:58:28,501 --> 00:58:30,792
You can't keep us here all day.

810
00:58:31,376 --> 00:58:33,209
We have to negotiate a deal.

811
00:58:33,917 --> 00:58:37,126
You come again, you leave
and nothing happened.

812
00:58:37,251 --> 00:58:39,376
We won't report him, right?

813
00:58:41,917 --> 00:58:44,626
Agreed? You come and leave, OK?

814
00:58:45,292 --> 00:58:46,959
- Did you hear?
- So come on.

815
00:58:47,084 --> 00:58:48,876
So come on, do it!

816
00:58:59,626 --> 00:59:01,417
That's all we need, who can it be?

817
00:59:01,542 --> 00:59:03,667
Go to the kitchen.
Don't open, whoever it is.

818
00:59:03,792 --> 00:59:04,834
Open!

819
00:59:04,959 --> 00:59:06,459
How can I, I'm tied!

820
00:59:06,584 --> 00:59:08,251
Ask for help.

821
00:59:08,376 --> 00:59:10,084
I'm gagged too!

822
00:59:10,209 --> 00:59:11,209
Do something.

823
00:59:11,334 --> 00:59:15,834
Do something! What?

824
00:59:17,709 --> 00:59:21,959
Come on, come!

825
00:59:25,917 --> 00:59:26,959
Nothing doing here.

826
00:59:27,084 --> 00:59:28,126
Wait.

827
00:59:29,251 --> 00:59:30,292
I hear something.

828
00:59:33,876 --> 00:59:35,417
Something's going on!

829
00:59:35,542 --> 00:59:37,417
Open! Police!

830
00:59:40,001 --> 00:59:41,876
Open or we'll kick the door!

831
00:59:43,542 --> 00:59:45,917
Don't shoot!

832
00:59:49,376 --> 00:59:52,709
Don't go in! We don't know who's there!
Let's get back-up!

833
00:59:52,834 --> 00:59:54,001
Cover me.

834
00:59:57,001 --> 00:59:57,959
Were you raped?

835
00:59:58,084 --> 01:00:02,376
Don't know. They hit me.
If they raped me, I didn't notice.

836
01:00:02,501 --> 01:00:03,542
How many are they?

837
01:00:03,667 --> 01:00:05,584
I answered the door to one.

838
01:00:05,709 --> 01:00:07,751
You should only open to the cops.

839
01:00:08,667 --> 01:00:12,042
He was disguised,
what could I do?

840
01:00:14,167 --> 01:00:15,292
Should we get help?

841
01:00:15,417 --> 01:00:18,501
I'm going in, cover me.
You stay here!

842
01:00:21,251 --> 01:00:22,459
What if they're armed?

843
01:00:22,584 --> 01:00:24,584
So are we, goddamn!

844
01:00:24,709 --> 01:00:27,126
Here, in the bedroom!

845
01:00:27,626 --> 01:00:29,292
The middle door.

846
01:00:29,417 --> 01:00:31,792
- It's a trap.
- Who cares.

847
01:00:31,917 --> 01:00:36,251
I can't wait all day for you to come!

848
01:00:38,834 --> 01:00:40,001
Don't be suicidal.

849
01:00:40,126 --> 01:00:42,126
I'll be as suicidal as I want to.

850
01:00:45,917 --> 01:00:48,042
Police! Let the woman go!

851
01:00:48,167 --> 01:00:50,084
You, help me with the knife!

852
01:00:56,376 --> 01:00:59,001
Asshole!
I'm pointing a gun to your head!

853
01:00:59,126 --> 01:01:00,167
They're pointing a gun!

854
01:01:00,292 --> 01:01:02,834
- Listen to him, he's nuts!
- He's nuts!

855
01:01:02,959 --> 01:01:06,792
I don't want to shoot
and fry your brain!

856
01:01:06,917 --> 01:01:08,876
Not fry his brain, no!

857
01:01:09,001 --> 01:01:11,251
He won't move. He's about to come!

858
01:01:11,376 --> 01:01:12,501
Gimme a hand!

859
01:01:16,251 --> 01:01:17,209
Don't worry, se침ora!

860
01:01:19,209 --> 01:01:22,042
Paul, aren't you taking this too far?

861
01:01:33,834 --> 01:01:35,084
Come back, arsehole!

862
01:01:52,959 --> 01:01:55,917
Come here!

863
01:02:07,001 --> 01:02:10,042
Want a ride?
We can go somewhere and talk.

864
01:02:10,876 --> 01:02:12,001
Quick, the keys.

865
01:02:12,667 --> 01:02:14,542
Trust me.

866
01:02:27,167 --> 01:02:28,084
Son of a bitch!

867
01:02:32,626 --> 01:02:33,876
What's going on?

868
01:02:34,334 --> 01:02:35,626
Why did you let him go?

869
01:02:35,751 --> 01:02:36,709
Thought he'd kill himself.

870
01:02:36,834 --> 01:02:40,209
You're not paid to think, but to act.

871
01:02:40,334 --> 01:02:43,084
What are you doing here?
Who called you?

872
01:02:43,209 --> 01:02:46,792
No one.
If I wait for your calls, I'm done for.

873
01:02:46,917 --> 01:02:48,751
We thought it was a joke,
so we didn't call.

874
01:02:48,876 --> 01:02:50,001
How did you find out?

875
01:02:50,126 --> 01:02:52,584
A peeper, watching from his window.

876
01:02:53,042 --> 01:02:54,209
What was Paul doing up there?

877
01:02:54,334 --> 01:02:55,584
Nothing, just raping a girl.

878
01:02:55,709 --> 01:02:57,876
Call that nothing, you macho?
I'm going to see.

879
01:02:58,001 --> 01:02:59,626
Discreetly, Andrea, I know you.

880
01:02:59,751 --> 01:03:02,126
The girl may need my help.

881
01:03:02,876 --> 01:03:05,667
You get the door,
see a guy in disguise,

882
01:03:05,792 --> 01:03:08,501
can't say as what, and boom,

883
01:03:08,626 --> 01:03:11,792
you materialize in the kitchen,
tied to a chair.

884
01:03:11,917 --> 01:03:14,792
What happened from the door
to the kitchen?

885
01:03:14,917 --> 01:03:15,959
He must have dragged me.

886
01:03:16,084 --> 01:03:17,042
How?

887
01:03:17,167 --> 01:03:18,292
By the hair, I'd say.

888
01:03:18,417 --> 01:03:20,584
This hair hasn't been dragged.

889
01:03:20,709 --> 01:03:24,001
I was unconscious.
How can I remember, you jerk!

890
01:03:25,501 --> 01:03:26,501
What a surprise!

891
01:03:26,626 --> 01:03:27,876
I was walking by. The victim?

892
01:03:28,001 --> 01:03:28,917
In the bathroom.

893
01:03:29,042 --> 01:03:31,084
- Who are you?
- The maid.

894
01:03:31,917 --> 01:03:36,167
Find my motorbike M-3614-NC.

895
01:03:36,751 --> 01:03:38,917
And I want Paul Bazzo, alive!

896
01:03:41,001 --> 01:03:42,626
Did they rape you too?

897
01:03:42,751 --> 01:03:44,542
They punched me and I fainted.

898
01:03:45,042 --> 01:03:46,834
She's keeping something from us.

899
01:03:46,959 --> 01:03:48,084
You have marks.

900
01:03:48,209 --> 01:03:50,792
They tied me and gagged me.

901
01:03:51,292 --> 01:03:52,626
Tell me later, sweetie.

902
01:03:52,751 --> 01:03:55,251
- Diarrhoea colour.
- Light brown!

903
01:03:56,084 --> 01:03:57,084
Where's the bathroom?

904
01:03:57,209 --> 01:03:58,584
There. Should I take you?

905
01:03:58,709 --> 01:04:00,167
No, we'll talk later.

906
01:04:28,167 --> 01:04:29,292
What are you doing?

907
01:04:30,209 --> 01:04:32,959
Working.

908
01:04:33,084 --> 01:04:34,792
I think they tried to rape you.
Rather, they did rape you.

909
01:04:34,917 --> 01:04:36,292
What's it to you?

910
01:04:36,417 --> 01:04:38,959
Officer,
throw this woman out immediately!

911
01:04:40,584 --> 01:04:41,792
You heard her.

912
01:04:41,917 --> 01:04:46,542
Just an interview. I'm a psychologist.
I could help you get over the shock.

913
01:04:47,667 --> 01:04:52,042
I'll report her for violating my privacy
and you for consenting.

914
01:04:52,584 --> 01:04:56,959
Don't be unfair!
This man saved your life.

915
01:04:57,084 --> 01:04:59,167
That's true,
if it wasn't for us...

916
01:04:59,292 --> 01:05:01,792
You were raped,
but you needn't be rude.

917
01:05:01,917 --> 01:05:02,917
That takes the cake!

918
01:05:03,501 --> 01:05:06,084
Go, officer, you're intimidating her.

919
01:05:11,876 --> 01:05:14,959
These cops bother me too.
Only one question.

920
01:05:15,084 --> 01:05:19,001
Why did Paul visit you
as soon as he escaped?

921
01:05:19,126 --> 01:05:20,376
Did you know each other?

922
01:05:20,501 --> 01:05:24,209
How did he behave during the rape?
Did he menace you?

923
01:05:24,334 --> 01:05:28,542
How many times did he come?
Did you have an orgasm?

924
01:05:28,667 --> 01:05:30,584
Will the experience traumatize you?

925
01:05:30,709 --> 01:05:35,667
What do you think of judges
giving permits to certain prisoners?

926
01:05:35,792 --> 01:05:40,292
Think Paul's escape is a political
manoeuvre from the opposition?

927
01:05:42,001 --> 01:05:45,376
Your behaviour
attacks freedom of expression!

928
01:05:47,542 --> 01:05:49,042
I hate this room!

929
01:05:49,167 --> 01:05:50,126
It's strange.

930
01:05:50,251 --> 01:05:51,459
And the voyeur's address?

931
01:05:51,584 --> 01:05:53,251
Mario has it, but it's fake.

932
01:05:53,376 --> 01:05:55,417
Fine. I'll check it out.

933
01:05:55,542 --> 01:06:00,834
All these saints weren't much help, honey.

934
01:07:27,834 --> 01:07:29,917
Don't think about it, Juana.

935
01:07:30,042 --> 01:07:32,709
If I hadn't opened,
it wouldn't have happened.

936
01:07:32,834 --> 01:07:34,417
It's not your fault.

937
01:07:34,542 --> 01:07:37,209
Have a drink and relax.

938
01:07:38,251 --> 01:07:39,292
One for me.

939
01:07:40,876 --> 01:07:43,542
I would give my life to protect you.

940
01:07:43,667 --> 01:07:44,917
I know.

941
01:07:45,376 --> 01:07:46,876
I'm going upstairs.

942
01:07:47,001 --> 01:07:48,292
That's it, go upstairs.

943
01:07:48,751 --> 01:07:50,751
Big help the guy upstairs is!

944
01:07:51,376 --> 01:07:53,292
How dare you?

945
01:07:53,417 --> 01:07:56,959
'Cause you were here to protect me?
Big help you were!

946
01:07:58,001 --> 01:08:00,251
Don't interfere where you're not needed.

947
01:08:08,417 --> 01:08:10,209
We came to change the door.

948
01:08:11,209 --> 01:08:12,251
What happened?

949
01:08:12,376 --> 01:08:15,209
The police...
You know how they are.

950
01:08:15,334 --> 01:08:16,584
They're shots.

951
01:08:16,709 --> 01:08:19,542
The maid's in there
if you need something.

952
01:08:25,042 --> 01:08:26,667
What are you doing here?

953
01:08:27,209 --> 01:08:29,084
Ringing the doorbell.

954
01:08:29,209 --> 01:08:30,876
Nicholas isn't answering.

955
01:08:31,001 --> 01:08:34,126
Maybe out.
Why do you want to see him so late?

956
01:08:34,584 --> 01:08:37,376
I have a confession to make.

957
01:08:39,126 --> 01:08:42,667
I'm having an affair with him.

958
01:08:42,792 --> 01:08:43,751
What?

959
01:08:43,876 --> 01:08:47,209
I tried to tell you,
but never found the moment.

960
01:08:47,334 --> 01:08:50,459
We only see each other every day!
Some nerve!

961
01:08:50,584 --> 01:08:51,751
Don't shout, he could hear!

962
01:08:51,876 --> 01:08:53,001
See if I care!

963
01:08:53,126 --> 01:08:57,667
When I saw you half naked in the lift,
were you coming from here?

964
01:08:58,667 --> 01:09:02,667
You're a bitch!
Lying like this to me, your Kika!

965
01:09:02,792 --> 01:09:06,042
As if you were being
that sincere with Ram칩n...

966
01:09:06,167 --> 01:09:10,834
He's a man and you're my friend.
I never lied to you.

967
01:09:10,959 --> 01:09:11,876
You're right.

968
01:09:12,334 --> 01:09:16,584
And fuck with closed windows!
I could hear your howling.

969
01:09:16,709 --> 01:09:17,667
What do you mean?

970
01:09:17,792 --> 01:09:20,876
Last night.
Moaning like he was tearing you apart.

971
01:09:21,001 --> 01:09:23,626
I don't recollect being torn apart.

972
01:09:23,751 --> 01:09:24,917
I heard from downstairs.

973
01:09:25,042 --> 01:09:26,001
It was someone else.

974
01:09:26,126 --> 01:09:27,792
Don't be cynical or I'll slap you.

975
01:09:27,917 --> 01:09:31,792
Don't be gullible.
He said he was busy and couldn't see me.

976
01:09:31,917 --> 01:09:33,292
Of course he was!

977
01:09:33,417 --> 01:09:34,376
He's cheating on us.

978
01:09:34,501 --> 01:09:36,417
On you!
I'm not part of the lot, OK?

979
01:09:36,542 --> 01:09:39,709
I'm withdrawing from the competition.
Tell him!

980
01:09:42,667 --> 01:09:43,834
Hi, Ram칩n.

981
01:09:44,917 --> 01:09:45,959
Bye, Ram칩n.

982
01:09:47,709 --> 01:09:48,792
What's wrong?

983
01:09:48,917 --> 01:09:50,417
Nothing. Just quarrelling.

984
01:09:50,542 --> 01:09:52,792
And this? What happened here?

985
01:09:52,917 --> 01:09:54,167
We're changing the door.

986
01:09:54,292 --> 01:09:55,792
I see... But why?

987
01:09:55,917 --> 01:09:58,292
The police knocked it down, that's why.

988
01:09:58,417 --> 01:10:02,376
The police?
Couldn't they have buzzed?

989
01:10:05,667 --> 01:10:06,626
Have a drink.

990
01:10:07,667 --> 01:10:08,584
You'll need it.

991
01:10:09,501 --> 01:10:13,959
Then I'll have it.
You asked why the cops didn't buzz.

992
01:10:14,084 --> 01:10:18,959
They did, but we couldn't answer.
Juana was gagged and tied.

993
01:10:19,876 --> 01:10:21,959
And I was being raped.

994
01:10:22,084 --> 01:10:23,292
What do you mean raped?

995
01:10:23,417 --> 01:10:28,251
It was unpleasant, but now it's over.
The best is to forget.

996
01:10:29,417 --> 01:10:30,792
Sorry, I don't get it.

997
01:10:30,917 --> 01:10:31,834
You're so thick!

998
01:10:31,959 --> 01:10:35,167
These things happen every day,
today it happened to me.

999
01:10:37,167 --> 01:10:38,501
Who was the rapist?

1000
01:10:38,626 --> 01:10:44,042
You won't believe it.
Remember Paul and the procession?

1001
01:10:44,167 --> 01:10:47,376
The first thing he did was to come here.

1002
01:10:47,501 --> 01:10:50,001
He was disguised,
that's why Juana opened.

1003
01:10:50,126 --> 01:10:53,167
Before she knew it,
he hit her, tied her and everything.

1004
01:10:53,292 --> 01:10:55,834
I was asleep and didn't hear anything.

1005
01:10:55,959 --> 01:10:58,001
When I woke up, he was inside.

1006
01:10:58,126 --> 01:10:59,417
In the kitchen?

1007
01:10:59,542 --> 01:11:01,001
Inside me!

1008
01:11:01,126 --> 01:11:02,376
Son of a bitch!

1009
01:11:02,959 --> 01:11:04,876
You wonder how the cops came.

1010
01:11:07,834 --> 01:11:12,459
Seems a voyeur tipped them,
he was spying from his window.

1011
01:11:12,584 --> 01:11:15,292
A voyeur?
We're being spied too!

1012
01:11:15,417 --> 01:11:17,751
Yes, they're spying on us.

1013
01:11:18,376 --> 01:11:20,417
Any idea who it could be?

1014
01:11:20,542 --> 01:11:25,917
How could I?
They don't like being identified.

1015
01:11:26,042 --> 01:11:28,042
My cameras... Did he steal them?

1016
01:11:28,167 --> 01:11:29,292
He tried.

1017
01:11:29,417 --> 01:11:34,376
But with the rape he lost his head,
got distracted and left them.

1018
01:11:34,501 --> 01:11:38,834
I've been raped three times and
all you can think is of your cameras.

1019
01:11:38,959 --> 01:11:39,959
Raped three times?

1020
01:11:40,084 --> 01:11:44,292
If I'd been distracted,
the cops would've joined the party!

1021
01:11:44,417 --> 01:11:47,834
Then I argued with Juana
and fought with Amparo,

1022
01:11:48,834 --> 01:11:50,542
but I'd rather not go into detail.

1023
01:11:51,167 --> 01:11:54,084
<i>"TODAY'S WORST" AT 10PM</i>

1024
01:11:54,209 --> 01:11:55,417
Should I zap?

1025
01:11:55,542 --> 01:11:57,417
No more catastrophes for you today.

1026
01:11:57,542 --> 01:12:00,126
I want to see Scarface's program.

1027
01:12:00,251 --> 01:12:04,251
The bitch found out they were raping me
and tried to interview me.

1028
01:12:04,376 --> 01:12:05,584
Andrea?

1029
01:12:05,709 --> 01:12:07,167
Yes.
Do you know her?

1030
01:12:07,292 --> 01:12:10,626
She was a psychologist
before working on TV.

1031
01:12:10,751 --> 01:12:11,792
This nut, a psychologist!

1032
01:12:12,667 --> 01:12:14,959
I was her patient a few months.

1033
01:12:15,792 --> 01:12:17,501
I did it for my mother.

1034
01:12:20,126 --> 01:12:21,042
It couldn't have been worse.

1035
01:12:21,167 --> 01:12:22,917
Why didn't you ever tell me?

1036
01:12:23,667 --> 01:12:26,376
Because it never came up.

1037
01:12:28,209 --> 01:12:29,501
Did you do the interview?

1038
01:12:30,126 --> 01:12:31,876
I told her to fuck off.

1039
01:12:33,334 --> 01:12:34,792
So you knew her...

1040
01:12:35,834 --> 01:12:37,834
There's so much I don't know about you.

1041
01:12:38,376 --> 01:12:40,292
At another time...

1042
01:12:40,751 --> 01:12:42,792
More ice, Juana!

1043
01:12:44,667 --> 01:12:47,251
Why don't you stop drinking?

1044
01:12:47,376 --> 01:12:48,376
It seems you are celebrating.

1045
01:12:48,501 --> 01:12:51,376
I'm not celebrating,
just getting stunned.

1046
01:12:59,709 --> 01:13:03,542
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
This is Andrea

1047
01:13:04,417 --> 01:13:07,709
Scarface.

1048
01:13:07,834 --> 01:13:08,667
The ice.

1049
01:13:08,792 --> 01:13:12,251
Thanks and sorry for before.
Sit and watch with us.

1050
01:13:13,209 --> 01:13:15,084
I was arguing with him.

1051
01:13:18,417 --> 01:13:21,292
Today we have a real scoop.

1052
01:13:21,417 --> 01:13:24,667
Paul Bazzo, the porn star,

1053
01:13:24,792 --> 01:13:27,292
a fugitive from justice,

1054
01:13:27,417 --> 01:13:29,834
raped a girl today in Madrid.

1055
01:13:29,959 --> 01:13:33,042
To respect her privacy,
we won't reveal her name.

1056
01:13:33,167 --> 01:13:36,542
A piece of advice: be optimistic.

1057
01:13:36,667 --> 01:13:39,376
This or worse could've happened to you.

1058
01:13:39,501 --> 01:13:43,376
A message from our sponsor,
Royal Milk.

1059
01:13:59,209 --> 01:14:00,417
I'm so ashamed!

1060
01:14:35,417 --> 01:14:37,334
I'm going to file a suit
she'll never forget!

1061
01:14:37,459 --> 01:14:38,376
What for?

1062
01:14:38,501 --> 01:14:40,834
We'll give more publicity
to the programme.

1063
01:14:40,959 --> 01:14:43,876
I don't give a fuck about publicity!

1064
01:14:44,001 --> 01:14:45,709
You don't care
I'm being publicly humiliated?

1065
01:14:46,751 --> 01:14:48,251
I don't understand you.

1066
01:14:53,334 --> 01:14:55,084
Juana, it's Reme.

1067
01:14:55,209 --> 01:14:56,251
What's wrong?

1068
01:14:56,376 --> 01:14:58,334
Did you watch TV?

1069
01:14:58,459 --> 01:15:00,417
I just saw...
What a tragedy!

1070
01:15:00,542 --> 01:15:02,584
How could you send him here?

1071
01:15:02,709 --> 01:15:04,459
I'll come get him tonight.

1072
01:15:04,584 --> 01:15:06,167
I don't want him here.

1073
01:15:07,626 --> 01:15:09,792
- It's you!
- Seen the programme?

1074
01:15:09,959 --> 01:15:11,667
It's you we haven't seen all day!

1075
01:15:11,792 --> 01:15:12,834
I was busy.

1076
01:15:12,959 --> 01:15:16,709
So was I, but found time to come up.

1077
01:15:16,834 --> 01:15:18,584
You didn't answer the door.

1078
01:15:18,709 --> 01:15:21,792
Can we talk when Ram칩n's not around?

1079
01:15:21,917 --> 01:15:25,626
There's nothing to talk about.
It's over.

1080
01:15:26,417 --> 01:15:27,417
When you heard shots,

1081
01:15:27,542 --> 01:15:30,501
weren't you curious to know
what happened?

1082
01:15:30,626 --> 01:15:33,167
Why do you let her drink?
Doesn't suit her.

1083
01:15:33,292 --> 01:15:35,292
I don't need permission to drink.

1084
01:15:36,042 --> 01:15:37,834
Now the problem is that I'm drunk!

1085
01:15:38,459 --> 01:15:39,876
You're not solving anything.

1086
01:15:40,001 --> 01:15:41,667
Be a good girl, stop drinking.

1087
01:15:42,209 --> 01:15:44,334
You be a good boy, I'm a saint!

1088
01:15:44,459 --> 01:15:46,084
- Kika, please!
- No way!

1089
01:15:46,209 --> 01:15:47,167
Enough already!

1090
01:16:06,542 --> 01:16:10,042
I'm sorry. I'm overwhelmed.

1091
01:16:16,501 --> 01:16:19,042
How do you think I feel?

1092
01:16:32,626 --> 01:16:35,959
Try to rest and forgive me.

1093
01:16:36,084 --> 01:16:37,417
Don't touch me.

1094
01:16:38,792 --> 01:16:41,292
I'll sue her,
with or without your support.

1095
01:16:42,959 --> 01:16:45,667
Wouldn't it be better
to forget all about it?

1096
01:16:45,792 --> 01:16:47,709
I don't want to forget.

1097
01:16:47,834 --> 01:16:51,709
I don't want my rape to sell more milk.

1098
01:16:53,584 --> 01:16:54,792
As you wish.

1099
01:16:54,917 --> 01:16:56,959
I'll say goodbye to Nicholas.

1100
01:17:00,126 --> 01:17:02,834
By the way,
I fucked Nicholas once in a while.

1101
01:17:04,917 --> 01:17:06,209
Nothing to say?

1102
01:17:06,959 --> 01:17:08,667
What should I say?

1103
01:17:10,667 --> 01:17:12,126
Now you know it.

1104
01:17:13,542 --> 01:17:15,709
The cops said the voyeur told them.

1105
01:17:15,834 --> 01:17:17,709
Who called Andrea?

1106
01:17:17,834 --> 01:17:19,959
I don't know who called her.

1107
01:17:20,084 --> 01:17:23,334
Go to your room,
you'll clean up tomorrow.

1108
01:17:26,001 --> 01:17:28,334
Is a voyeur spying us?

1109
01:17:28,959 --> 01:17:29,959
So it seems.

1110
01:17:30,667 --> 01:17:32,834
What's the matter? You don't care?

1111
01:17:34,084 --> 01:17:35,751
I do care!

1112
01:17:36,334 --> 01:17:38,209
I'm tired of that question!

1113
01:17:41,834 --> 01:17:44,792
It's Nicholas.
I've just seen your programme.

1114
01:17:45,334 --> 01:17:49,001
Hope it didn't bother you,
it wasn't my intention.

1115
01:17:49,126 --> 01:17:51,584
What was it then,
vengeance on Ram칩n?

1116
01:17:52,334 --> 01:17:56,459
You know a good professional
shouldn't have scruples.

1117
01:17:56,584 --> 01:17:58,209
Some professional!

1118
01:17:58,709 --> 01:18:02,209
Watch the ratings
and you'll see what I mean.

1119
01:18:02,334 --> 01:18:03,834
What about the rape footage?

1120
01:18:04,501 --> 01:18:06,042
A voyeur gave it.

1121
01:18:06,167 --> 01:18:07,501
Who is he? His address?

1122
01:18:07,959 --> 01:18:09,917
We don't reveal our sources.

1123
01:18:10,626 --> 01:18:13,376
Various voyeurs send us things.

1124
01:18:14,209 --> 01:18:17,501
We have lots of unbiased collaborators.

1125
01:18:17,626 --> 01:18:21,167
If you don't know him,
how'd you find out

1126
01:18:21,667 --> 01:18:23,751
right when it was happening?

1127
01:18:24,209 --> 01:18:25,876
He called the cops, they called me.

1128
01:18:26,334 --> 01:18:27,792
They do it sometimes.

1129
01:18:27,917 --> 01:18:30,001
We bribe two officers.

1130
01:18:30,126 --> 01:18:31,959
Please, don't mention this to anyone.

1131
01:18:32,417 --> 01:18:34,959
I live a floor above.

1132
01:18:35,084 --> 01:18:36,959
If he sees them,
he can see me too.

1133
01:18:37,084 --> 01:18:39,876
Don't insist,
I don't know who the voyeur is.

1134
01:18:40,792 --> 01:18:43,209
You don't have a monopoly on vengeance.

1135
01:18:43,834 --> 01:18:45,126
Are you threatening me?

1136
01:18:45,626 --> 01:18:47,084
Call it what you want.

1137
01:18:47,209 --> 01:18:51,542
Forget our collaboration.
I want nothing to do with your show.

1138
01:18:52,334 --> 01:18:53,292
As you like.

1139
01:18:54,001 --> 01:18:55,667
I'm warning you.

1140
01:18:55,792 --> 01:18:59,209
If you air one more image related to us,

1141
01:18:59,709 --> 01:19:01,834
I swear you'll regret it.

1142
01:19:08,959 --> 01:19:11,417
I didn't know you wrote for her show.

1143
01:19:11,542 --> 01:19:13,667
I'm a writer, I live from that.

1144
01:19:14,167 --> 01:19:16,167
She's not taking revenge on me,

1145
01:19:16,876 --> 01:19:18,001
but on you!

1146
01:19:19,376 --> 01:19:22,417
She hasn't stopped menacing me
since I left her.

1147
01:19:23,001 --> 01:19:24,959
This woman should be locked up.

1148
01:19:25,084 --> 01:19:26,667
You have to call the police.

1149
01:19:26,792 --> 01:19:27,709
What for?

1150
01:19:27,834 --> 01:19:32,292
To find the voyeur
and recoup what he filmed.

1151
01:19:32,417 --> 01:19:34,376
Think the police will tell me?

1152
01:19:34,501 --> 01:19:38,667
Say you'll report
the officers Andrea bribes.

1153
01:19:39,876 --> 01:19:41,542
It's pointless.

1154
01:19:42,292 --> 01:19:45,501
They don't know the voyeur,
he didn't identify himself.

1155
01:19:46,126 --> 01:19:47,042
How do you know?

1156
01:19:47,167 --> 01:19:48,501
Because it was me.

1157
01:19:49,209 --> 01:19:50,876
I'm the one who called.

1158
01:19:51,959 --> 01:19:56,167
I see the house from my studio
and like watching Kika.

1159
01:19:57,542 --> 01:20:02,376
Besides spying her,
you gave the tapes to Andrea!

1160
01:20:02,501 --> 01:20:03,584
I didn't say that!

1161
01:20:03,709 --> 01:20:06,001
So what the fuck did you say?

1162
01:20:06,126 --> 01:20:10,292
When she was in danger,
I called the cops. That's it.

1163
01:20:10,417 --> 01:20:11,334
That's it?

1164
01:20:12,709 --> 01:20:15,376
I didn't film what was on TV.

1165
01:20:15,501 --> 01:20:19,376
Someone Andrea knows or she herself did.

1166
01:20:19,917 --> 01:20:22,751
Show me everything you filmed till now.

1167
01:20:36,209 --> 01:20:37,709
What's in there?

1168
01:20:37,834 --> 01:20:39,001
Souvenirs of mother.

1169
01:20:40,542 --> 01:20:43,876
- Are those her diaries?
- Yes.

1170
01:20:44,417 --> 01:20:46,042
So you had them...

1171
01:20:46,834 --> 01:20:51,251
I hid them the day she died.
Didn't want them flying around.

1172
01:20:51,376 --> 01:20:52,709
Did you read them?

1173
01:20:52,834 --> 01:20:54,667
No, I can't.

1174
01:20:55,667 --> 01:20:57,917
I'd like to have a look.

1175
01:20:58,501 --> 01:20:59,876
Don't even dream about it!

1176
01:21:02,834 --> 01:21:04,584
Here's everything I filmed.

1177
01:21:41,417 --> 01:21:43,751
I should've known.
You liked to snoop.

1178
01:21:50,667 --> 01:21:53,209
I often discovered
you behind our bedroom door

1179
01:21:53,667 --> 01:21:55,667
when I made love with your mother.

1180
01:22:15,126 --> 01:22:18,709
What timing! "The Prowler".

1181
01:22:30,417 --> 01:22:31,667
You spied on me last night?

1182
01:22:32,126 --> 01:22:34,292
No, I was here with Kika.

1183
01:22:35,292 --> 01:22:37,376
You don't have to hide anything.

1184
01:22:37,501 --> 01:22:38,959
We all know everything.

1185
01:22:39,084 --> 01:22:40,417
Better.

1186
01:22:40,542 --> 01:22:43,709
I'm tired of behaving like an adolescent.

1187
01:22:43,834 --> 01:22:46,542
Why did you advance the move?

1188
01:22:46,667 --> 01:22:49,209
We agreed to do it in three days.

1189
01:22:49,334 --> 01:22:53,334
You're in no position to interrogate me

1190
01:22:53,459 --> 01:22:55,584
and I won't allow it.

1191
01:22:56,042 --> 01:22:57,251
Very well.

1192
01:22:57,376 --> 01:22:59,584
Get out!
I don't want to see you again.

1193
01:23:00,417 --> 01:23:03,042
I'll pack and go in the morning.

1194
01:23:03,167 --> 01:23:06,209
Remember you owe me half of Youkali.

1195
01:23:07,459 --> 01:23:10,084
I'll send you my new address.

1196
01:23:10,209 --> 01:23:13,001
The sooner we settle this,
the better.

1197
01:23:16,167 --> 01:23:18,001
You're leaving too?

1198
01:23:19,584 --> 01:23:20,501
Of course.

1199
01:23:20,959 --> 01:23:22,376
What's in there?

1200
01:23:22,501 --> 01:23:24,334
The small chairs, as souvenir.

1201
01:23:24,459 --> 01:23:26,501
And I stole some stuff as severance pay.

1202
01:23:26,626 --> 01:23:29,376
Good idea, you have your rights.

1203
01:23:29,876 --> 01:23:32,584
Let's get a cab.

1204
01:23:32,709 --> 01:23:34,667
I left the keys upstairs and
I don't feel like getting them.

1205
01:23:35,292 --> 01:23:36,251
Where are you going?

1206
01:23:36,376 --> 01:23:38,167
To my cousin's. And you se침ora?

1207
01:23:38,292 --> 01:23:41,292
Call me Kika, I'm no longer your se침ora.

1208
01:23:41,417 --> 01:23:45,917
I don't know.
To a hotel or to Amparo's, I'll see.

1209
01:23:46,042 --> 01:23:47,417
Can I give you a ride?

1210
01:23:47,542 --> 01:23:49,001
No, I'll take the subway.

1211
01:23:49,126 --> 01:23:50,292
As you like.

1212
01:23:50,417 --> 01:23:52,626
I'd go anywhere with you.

1213
01:23:52,751 --> 01:23:55,667
I wasn't propositioning you!

1214
01:23:55,792 --> 01:23:56,709
I'm sorry.

1215
01:23:57,167 --> 01:23:59,417
What I like about you is your sincerity.

1216
01:23:59,542 --> 01:24:01,917
If only everyone could be like you...

1217
01:24:02,042 --> 01:24:03,126
Give me a kiss.

1218
01:24:08,917 --> 01:24:11,501
Kika, I lied to you too.

1219
01:24:12,001 --> 01:24:14,209
- You too?
- Yes.

1220
01:24:14,334 --> 01:24:15,792
Pablo is my brother.

1221
01:24:16,584 --> 01:24:17,501
Pablo who?

1222
01:24:18,001 --> 01:24:19,751
Paul Bazzo, he's my brother.

1223
01:24:20,667 --> 01:24:22,292
Paul, your brother?

1224
01:24:22,417 --> 01:24:23,751
I'm going to meet him.

1225
01:24:23,876 --> 01:24:25,626
Get him out of my cousin's house.

1226
01:24:25,751 --> 01:24:27,667
Let's go.
Wherever.

1227
01:24:28,167 --> 01:24:31,501
He's retarded.
He's my brother and I have to help him!

1228
01:24:55,417 --> 01:24:57,709
- Halt!
- Please don't!

1229
01:25:29,042 --> 01:25:30,209
Goodbye.

1230
01:26:23,834 --> 01:26:27,417
Killing is like cutting your toe nails.

1231
01:26:28,167 --> 01:26:31,542
At first,
thinking about it makes you lazy.

1232
01:26:32,042 --> 01:26:37,084
When you cut them, you discover
it's quicker than you imagined.

1233
01:26:38,417 --> 01:26:42,292
You think a long time will pass
before doing it again.

1234
01:26:43,376 --> 01:26:47,251
But when you least expect it,
they've grown again.

1235
01:27:22,626 --> 01:27:24,459
What the fuck they saying?

1236
01:27:54,667 --> 01:27:55,876
The vase.

1237
01:28:07,251 --> 01:28:08,209
It's not there.

1238
01:28:16,584 --> 01:28:17,834
Here.

1239
01:29:46,501 --> 01:29:48,084
Nicholas, is that you?

1240
01:29:57,167 --> 01:29:58,667
These stains...

1241
01:29:59,709 --> 01:30:01,126
What stains?

1242
01:30:01,751 --> 01:30:04,126
These stains look like blood.

1243
01:30:04,667 --> 01:30:06,792
You're hallucinating.

1244
01:30:07,667 --> 01:30:09,042
You shouldn't have come.

1245
01:30:14,084 --> 01:30:15,417
You look terrible.

1246
01:30:15,542 --> 01:30:17,209
I didn't sleep all night.

1247
01:30:18,042 --> 01:30:19,834
I'm exhausted too.

1248
01:30:19,959 --> 01:30:22,792
Then go home and rest,
we'll meet later.

1249
01:30:23,542 --> 01:30:26,501
We don't need to see each other again.

1250
01:30:27,751 --> 01:30:29,792
I brought mother's things.

1251
01:30:33,792 --> 01:30:37,167
Including the diaries
you were so keen on.

1252
01:30:37,834 --> 01:30:39,917
Why this change of heart?

1253
01:30:40,042 --> 01:30:43,751
Everything belongs to you,
but this note.

1254
01:30:44,501 --> 01:30:46,417
You thought differently last night.

1255
01:30:46,959 --> 01:30:49,292
I hadn't read them last night.

1256
01:30:49,417 --> 01:30:51,501
You finally found the strength.

1257
01:30:58,584 --> 01:31:00,334
Kika had left.

1258
01:31:01,626 --> 01:31:03,417
I was desperate

1259
01:31:05,042 --> 01:31:06,334
and thought of mother.

1260
01:31:08,042 --> 01:31:10,251
I thought I understood her
for the first time,

1261
01:31:12,126 --> 01:31:14,917
so I began reading her diaries.

1262
01:31:21,584 --> 01:31:23,167
You know how I loved her.

1263
01:31:24,917 --> 01:31:28,709
Despite her neurosis,

1264
01:31:29,667 --> 01:31:32,126
I thought she cared about me
in her own way.

1265
01:31:35,251 --> 01:31:36,667
I was wrong.

1266
01:31:39,167 --> 01:31:41,209
She didn't give a damn about me!

1267
01:31:42,542 --> 01:31:44,542
Not even a line about me.

1268
01:31:44,667 --> 01:31:47,959
If she mentions me,
it's to say she's tired of me.

1269
01:31:48,542 --> 01:31:52,834
Only you existed, her executioner!

1270
01:31:57,001 --> 01:31:59,167
Life didn't interest her without you,

1271
01:32:03,334 --> 01:32:04,501
nothing kept her here.

1272
01:32:05,251 --> 01:32:09,459
Your mother wouldn't admit
it was over between us,

1273
01:32:09,584 --> 01:32:11,459
but I wasn't her executioner.

1274
01:32:14,209 --> 01:32:15,334
You killed her!

1275
01:32:18,001 --> 01:32:19,459
You're still hallucinating.

1276
01:32:20,001 --> 01:32:21,751
That's enough, Nicholas!

1277
01:32:21,876 --> 01:32:25,084
You did,
but I can't even blame you for that!

1278
01:32:25,209 --> 01:32:28,792
Her life belonged to you,
you could take it away anytime.

1279
01:32:28,917 --> 01:32:32,667
She committed suicide,
it wasn't the first time she tried.

1280
01:32:32,792 --> 01:32:34,792
You know it as well as I do.

1281
01:32:35,626 --> 01:32:38,542
You killed her!
Here's the proof!

1282
01:32:51,667 --> 01:32:53,251
April 20th.

1283
01:32:53,376 --> 01:32:55,126
Mother died in June.

1284
01:32:55,251 --> 01:32:59,251
The note was written and ripped out by her
two months before she died,

1285
01:32:59,792 --> 01:33:01,667
when she tried to kill herself.

1286
01:33:02,251 --> 01:33:04,751
I made it in time to take her to hospital.

1287
01:33:04,876 --> 01:33:07,417
You found the note and kept it.

1288
01:33:07,876 --> 01:33:09,876
You didn't give it to me then.

1289
01:33:10,001 --> 01:33:14,709
You gave it to me after you killed her,
to justify her suicide.

1290
01:34:44,959 --> 01:34:46,542
Dear Kika,

1291
01:34:46,667 --> 01:34:49,959
I'm going to Casa Youkali.

1292
01:34:50,751 --> 01:34:53,167
Something important's come up.
Unforeseen, impossible as it seems.

1293
01:34:54,042 --> 01:34:59,167
I must speak to Nicholas,
as I feel I'll never see him again.

1294
01:35:00,209 --> 01:35:04,042
I won't ask for another chance,
I don't deserve it.

1295
01:35:05,667 --> 01:35:09,126
I wanted to die tonight,
but don't suffer for me.

1296
01:35:09,251 --> 01:35:11,792
You gave me more than I deserved.

1297
01:35:12,667 --> 01:35:18,084
In my own dirty and silent way,
I loved you and love you.

1298
01:35:18,209 --> 01:35:20,626
Forgive me.
Ram칩n.

1299
01:36:00,042 --> 01:36:01,251
What do you want?

1300
01:36:01,376 --> 01:36:03,751
I brought money for the chapters.

1301
01:36:06,209 --> 01:36:08,042
How'd you know I was here?

1302
01:36:08,167 --> 01:36:10,376
I supposed.
Won't you ask me in?

1303
01:36:10,501 --> 01:36:12,417
No. And quit filming!

1304
01:36:14,042 --> 01:36:15,001
Here.

1305
01:36:15,126 --> 01:36:18,459
I brought cash
to avoid you going to the bank.

1306
01:36:18,959 --> 01:36:20,584
Fine. Goodbye.

1307
01:36:22,209 --> 01:36:23,376
The receipt!

1308
01:36:23,834 --> 01:36:25,751
You have to sign it!

1309
01:36:28,542 --> 01:36:30,209
I'd like to speak to Ram칩n.

1310
01:36:31,001 --> 01:36:31,751
He's not here.

1311
01:36:31,876 --> 01:36:33,959
What's his car doing here?

1312
01:36:34,084 --> 01:36:35,334
I brought it.

1313
01:36:38,459 --> 01:36:39,876
I know he's here.

1314
01:36:41,376 --> 01:36:44,376
I heard you talking.
I've been outside a while.

1315
01:36:47,917 --> 01:36:50,959
In any case,
it's you I want to talk to.

1316
01:36:51,084 --> 01:36:53,209
- Give me an interview!
- What?

1317
01:36:53,709 --> 01:36:54,751
An interview!

1318
01:36:57,251 --> 01:37:00,417
You don't have much time to flee,
I'll be brief.

1319
01:37:01,334 --> 01:37:04,209
I'll air it when you're far from here!

1320
01:37:05,209 --> 01:37:06,126
Don't bluff!

1321
01:37:06,792 --> 01:37:07,792
I know everything.

1322
01:37:09,834 --> 01:37:12,251
Your trips were a great excuse to kill.

1323
01:37:17,751 --> 01:37:21,251
You killed your wife,
but I don't care.

1324
01:37:21,376 --> 01:37:22,959
I want to know about the others,
starting with the blonde.

1325
01:37:23,459 --> 01:37:25,709
Shut up or I'll cut your tongue!

1326
01:37:25,834 --> 01:37:28,334
You'd do it if you could.

1327
01:37:32,751 --> 01:37:37,084
A man who kills a woman with a vase
after she's sung in the moonlight

1328
01:37:37,209 --> 01:37:38,459
is capable of anything.

1329
01:37:45,542 --> 01:37:47,792
I'm talking about the blonde Mexican.

1330
01:37:47,917 --> 01:37:50,751
You said she was with you
only an hour that day,

1331
01:37:50,876 --> 01:37:53,709
yet I filmed you both
that night at home

1332
01:37:53,834 --> 01:37:55,959
just before my phone call.

1333
01:37:56,959 --> 01:37:58,667
The ditch is for her, right?

1334
01:38:13,001 --> 01:38:14,501
I'm coming in!

1335
01:38:58,751 --> 01:39:02,251
Must I prove what I'd do for an interview?

1336
01:39:02,376 --> 01:39:07,001
For once I'm facing a serial killer,
I won't miss the chance!

1337
01:39:07,126 --> 01:39:08,334
Don't move!

1338
01:39:08,459 --> 01:39:09,667
The knife!

1339
01:39:14,917 --> 01:39:16,209
Sit there!

1340
01:39:18,876 --> 01:39:21,251
Let's talk like civilized people.

1341
01:39:25,959 --> 01:39:31,126
From your bibliography
and the proof I just got,

1342
01:39:31,251 --> 01:39:33,751
I don't doubt you're a serial killer.

1343
01:39:33,876 --> 01:39:36,917
I can give you a detailed report
on my deductions,

1344
01:39:37,042 --> 01:39:39,792
but save me the ostentation.

1345
01:39:39,917 --> 01:39:41,209
We have no time.

1346
01:39:41,334 --> 01:39:43,001
I need a doctor.

1347
01:39:43,709 --> 01:39:47,167
You need much more,
you need my complicity.

1348
01:39:47,626 --> 01:39:49,084
We'll make a deal.

1349
01:39:49,209 --> 01:39:51,959
I'll get a doctor for your wound.

1350
01:39:52,084 --> 01:39:55,626
I'll help you flee or hide,
whatever you prefer.

1351
01:39:55,751 --> 01:39:58,959
For the interview
I can pay 10 million.

1352
01:39:59,084 --> 01:40:01,459
That's what we offer bounty hunters.

1353
01:40:03,834 --> 01:40:06,251
I suppose you'd rather have it.

1354
01:40:06,709 --> 01:40:10,501
I don't have it here,
but I'll send it where you say.

1355
01:40:11,459 --> 01:40:13,876
I won't air the interview
till you're out of here.

1356
01:40:14,751 --> 01:40:16,126
What do you say?

1357
01:40:16,251 --> 01:40:17,417
Do I have a choice?

1358
01:40:24,959 --> 01:40:26,542
Let's get to work.

1359
01:40:27,792 --> 01:40:29,626
About the blonde Mexican...

1360
01:40:29,751 --> 01:40:33,251
You got rid of her in the chest
during the move, right?

1361
01:40:33,376 --> 01:40:35,542
Who was she?
Who is she in the novel?

1362
01:40:35,667 --> 01:40:37,209
I'm bleeding to death.

1363
01:40:37,334 --> 01:40:41,251
Don't lose time then!
Who was she? Why'd you kill her?

1364
01:40:41,376 --> 01:40:45,626
In the novel she's identical to
the lesbian killer's last victim's sister.

1365
01:40:46,126 --> 01:40:48,834
Why not tell me you're
that ridiculous lesbian?

1366
01:40:51,376 --> 01:40:53,334
- I'll explain it all.
- When?

1367
01:40:53,459 --> 01:40:55,959
Now, but help me stop the haemorrhage.

1368
01:40:58,751 --> 01:41:01,626
Take that shirt,
tie it around your knee.

1369
01:41:02,417 --> 01:41:04,209
Don't forget I'm pointing a gun

1370
01:41:06,709 --> 01:41:08,126
and I'm tired of waiting.

1371
01:41:27,042 --> 01:41:29,209
Why didn't you listen to me?

1372
01:41:36,167 --> 01:41:38,167
We have little time,

1373
01:41:39,167 --> 01:41:40,334
say yes or no.

1374
01:41:42,334 --> 01:41:43,376
Just nod your head.

1375
01:41:43,959 --> 01:41:46,626
I'll take you to the hospital, I swear.

1376
01:41:46,751 --> 01:41:50,917
You committed
all the crimes you wrote about, right?

1377
01:41:51,834 --> 01:41:53,376
Tell me yes or no.

1378
01:41:55,084 --> 01:41:57,876
Nod your head.

1379
01:41:58,001 --> 01:42:00,959
Tell me yes...

1380
01:42:25,751 --> 01:42:27,876
God, what am I going to do?

1381
01:42:30,917 --> 01:42:32,042
The ditch!

1382
01:43:29,834 --> 01:43:32,209
What happened?

1383
01:43:33,209 --> 01:43:34,584
That madwoman...

1384
01:43:35,792 --> 01:43:36,834
And Ram칩n?

1385
01:43:37,626 --> 01:43:39,751
Up in his room.

1386
01:43:39,876 --> 01:43:41,417
Is he dead?

1387
01:43:42,251 --> 01:43:43,751
You never know...

1388
01:43:43,876 --> 01:43:45,126
He's dead...

1389
01:43:45,251 --> 01:43:47,584
You never know with that boy.

1390
01:43:48,084 --> 01:43:53,209
I don't have time for speeches.

1391
01:44:01,001 --> 01:44:02,751
A gift for you.

1392
01:44:04,251 --> 01:44:08,209
Publish it,
it'll be a best-seller.

1393
01:44:09,584 --> 01:44:12,709
Just change the title

1394
01:44:12,834 --> 01:44:15,626
and the main character's name.

1395
01:44:15,751 --> 01:44:18,876
Put mine in her place

1396
01:44:19,459 --> 01:44:22,876
and it'll become my autobiography.

1397
01:44:23,792 --> 01:44:27,292
You're delirious, Nicholas.

1398
01:44:27,417 --> 01:44:29,209
Hold me, Kika.

1399
01:44:30,834 --> 01:44:32,834
If I have to die,

1400
01:44:32,959 --> 01:44:37,042
I'd rather do it in a woman's arms.

1401
01:45:35,917 --> 01:45:38,376
We met on this bed.

1402
01:45:47,084 --> 01:45:49,542
Why didn't I bring my make-up?

1403
01:45:57,626 --> 01:45:58,959
It's Kika.

1404
01:46:01,001 --> 01:46:04,042
Ram칩n, it's Kika.

1405
01:47:24,417 --> 01:47:25,792
What's going on?

1406
01:47:25,917 --> 01:47:27,042
I don't know.

1407
01:47:29,334 --> 01:47:31,501
You had another attack,

1408
01:47:33,167 --> 01:47:34,876
a cataleptic attack.

1409
01:47:35,751 --> 01:47:37,334
My toe, it hurts...

1410
01:47:38,126 --> 01:47:42,459
I plugged you in,
so you would react.

1411
01:47:42,584 --> 01:47:43,584
Are you hurt?

1412
01:47:43,709 --> 01:47:47,751
It's not my blood.
Don't touch me, I'm filthy.

1413
01:47:48,209 --> 01:47:51,001
I have to tell you something awful.

1414
01:47:51,126 --> 01:47:55,292
I don't want you to keel over again.
Can you resist it?

1415
01:47:55,417 --> 01:47:56,584
You're leaving me, right?

1416
01:47:56,709 --> 01:47:59,084
How can I leave you in this situation!

1417
01:47:59,209 --> 01:48:00,751
We'll talk about it later.

1418
01:48:02,417 --> 01:48:07,126
Andrea and Nicholas are dead downstairs.

1419
01:48:08,126 --> 01:48:09,084
Dead?

1420
01:48:09,209 --> 01:48:12,292
Never saw so much blood in my life.

1421
01:48:12,417 --> 01:48:14,751
They must have killed each other.

1422
01:48:17,542 --> 01:48:19,709
When will this nightmare end?

1423
01:48:23,876 --> 01:48:27,459
I'm not superstitious, but this ring,

1424
01:48:27,584 --> 01:48:30,959
things have happened since
you gave it to me.

1425
01:48:31,084 --> 01:48:32,334
Whose was it?

1426
01:48:33,001 --> 01:48:34,209
My mother's.

1427
01:48:35,167 --> 01:48:37,667
She wasn't lucky either, poor thing!

1428
01:48:37,792 --> 01:48:39,501
Who gave it to her?

1429
01:48:39,626 --> 01:48:40,626
My father.

1430
01:48:41,459 --> 01:48:46,751
You never talked about him,
you're so hermetic.

1431
01:48:46,876 --> 01:48:48,709
He was decapitated in a car.

1432
01:48:48,834 --> 01:48:50,167
For God's sake!

1433
01:48:52,751 --> 01:48:56,751
I'm calling an ambulance and the police.

1434
01:48:58,584 --> 01:48:59,834
We're in God's hands.

1435
01:49:00,792 --> 01:49:04,209
I'll follow in my car,
I'd rather not leave it here.

1436
01:49:48,126 --> 01:49:49,084
What's wrong?

1437
01:49:49,209 --> 01:49:53,126
Car's dead, and I'm best man
at my sister's wedding in Montilla.

1438
01:49:53,251 --> 01:49:56,001
Sorry, I'm going the other way.

1439
01:49:56,126 --> 01:49:58,834
Drop me off at a petrol station,
I'll get a cab.

1440
01:49:58,959 --> 01:50:01,626
Sure, I'll drop you.
Hop in.

1441
01:50:11,084 --> 01:50:12,751
Put your things here.

1442
01:50:14,167 --> 01:50:16,209
Make yourself comfortable

1443
01:50:17,334 --> 01:50:18,459
and let's go.

1444
01:50:20,084 --> 01:50:22,126
Want a tissue for your hands?

1445
01:50:23,042 --> 01:50:26,251
I'm a little dirty too,
I always get smudged.

1446
01:50:28,251 --> 01:50:31,084
I'd gladly drive you to your village,

1447
01:50:31,209 --> 01:50:33,334
but I have lots of things to do.

1448
01:50:33,459 --> 01:50:34,834
Don't worry about it.

1449
01:50:35,459 --> 01:50:38,959
Truth is,
distraction would do me good.

1450
01:50:39,084 --> 01:50:40,834
So go for it!

1451
01:50:40,959 --> 01:50:44,334
After the wedding,
we'll bop till we drop!

1452
01:50:44,834 --> 01:50:49,834
You've convinced me!
Get the map and find the way.

1453
01:50:49,959 --> 01:50:52,667
Don't need one,
I'll point you in the right direction.

1454
