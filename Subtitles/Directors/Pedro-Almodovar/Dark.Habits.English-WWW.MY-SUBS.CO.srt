3
00:02:39,241 --> 00:02:43,109
Calm down, she's coming.
Just look at me.

4
00:02:45,075 --> 00:02:46,702
I've been waiting two hours.

5
00:02:47,942 --> 00:02:49,500
- Have you got it?
- Yes.

6
00:03:07,274 --> 00:03:08,605
I met Lali.

7
00:03:09,441 --> 00:03:11,238
I haven't seen her in ages.

8
00:03:11,341 --> 00:03:14,606
We spent the whole time
drinking and talking about you.

9
00:03:15,075 --> 00:03:16,869
How interesting...

10
00:03:17,075 --> 00:03:20,067
You know what she said to me?
She said I should dump you

11
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:24,206
because you look crazy
and you scare people.

12
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:29,931
Do you want to know what I said?

13
00:03:32,908 --> 00:03:37,040
Lali thinks I should go back to teaching.
There's a job going.

14
00:03:38,074 --> 00:03:40,770
She says that I'll get nowhere singing.

15
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:44,971
But I don't care,
I'm an adventuress.

16
00:03:45,108 --> 00:03:49,569
But she doesn't understand
because she has no sense of humor.

17
00:03:54,675 --> 00:03:56,973
Have you written about me again?

18
00:03:58,274 --> 00:04:00,970
Give me that!
It's none of your business!

19
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,200
Fuck it!

20
00:04:19,141 --> 00:04:20,699
Forget about him!

21
00:05:44,141 --> 00:05:45,870
- Elvira...
- What is it?

22
00:05:45,974 --> 00:05:47,168
I got a problem.

23
00:05:47,274 --> 00:05:49,765
So what's new?
You just realized?

24
00:05:49,874 --> 00:05:53,469
This is what I call a problem.
Same thing every night.

25
00:05:53,575 --> 00:05:56,135
Don't joke.
This time it's serious.

26
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:58,903
Tell me in a minute.
I gotta take a piss.

27
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:01,601
- You got a light?
- Look around.

28
00:06:11,808 --> 00:06:13,036
Yolanda's room?

29
00:06:13,841 --> 00:06:17,368
It's across the hall,
but she's in the toilet now.

30
00:06:17,475 --> 00:06:20,167
Fine.
We'll wait there.

31
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:44,201
Good luck.

32
00:07:56,308 --> 00:07:59,835
Community of Humble Redeemers.
"Come to us."

33
00:08:05,774 --> 00:08:08,570
Good evening.
Excuse me.

34
00:08:10,674 --> 00:08:11,936
What is it?

35
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:14,099
I'd like your autograph.

36
00:08:15,807 --> 00:08:20,073
- My autograph?
- Yes, I'm a big fan of yours.

37
00:08:20,174 --> 00:08:24,602
I've often come to see you
and I'd love a signed photo.

38
00:08:24,707 --> 00:08:28,575
Well, I've just started.
I don't have many photos.

39
00:08:29,674 --> 00:08:33,034
- But that's a personal one.
- It doesn't matter.

40
00:08:33,141 --> 00:08:37,636
My first autograph, and for a nun!
It's a pleasure.

41
00:08:50,241 --> 00:08:51,833
Thank you so much.

42
00:08:55,707 --> 00:08:57,072
Do you like it?

43
00:08:57,174 --> 00:09:00,371
Our enclosed sisters make them to sell.

44
00:09:00,475 --> 00:09:03,535
I love it. It's gorgeous!

45
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,005
It's yours.

46
00:09:06,274 --> 00:09:08,970
If you need anything, come to me.

47
00:09:09,074 --> 00:09:14,004
Any problem you have,
I'll help you out.

48
00:09:14,108 --> 00:09:15,166
Here.

49
00:09:17,441 --> 00:09:21,373
A card. The Humble Redeemers.

50
00:09:23,607 --> 00:09:26,974
My poor daughter.
It was her father's fault.

51
00:09:27,574 --> 00:09:31,408
Don't say that.
He was a good servant of God.

52
00:09:31,508 --> 00:09:32,508
So what!

53
00:09:32,574 --> 00:09:35,008
As a father and husband,
he was a monster.

54
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:37,804
He may have been a little too strict.

55
00:09:37,907 --> 00:09:38,999
A fascist!

56
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:43,599
Since he died, I feel free.
I can live!

57
00:09:43,707 --> 00:09:46,608
If my daughter were alive,
she'd be delighted.

58
00:09:47,441 --> 00:09:48,738
But anyway...

59
00:09:49,607 --> 00:09:51,598
And your makeup classes?

60
00:09:51,707 --> 00:09:54,574
They're wonderful!
See for yourself.

61
00:09:54,774 --> 00:09:56,298
You look lovely.

62
00:09:57,341 --> 00:09:58,569
- I do what I can.
- Sure.

63
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:03,202
I'm stopping your monthly annuity.

64
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:07,270
Your husband promised it to us.

65
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:09,138
It's not in his will.

66
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:11,072
He promised it.

67
00:10:11,174 --> 00:10:13,608
And a dead person's wish is sacred.

68
00:10:13,707 --> 00:10:16,540
He must have forgotten about it.

69
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:23,076
- You'd put us on the street?
- On the street?

70
00:10:23,141 --> 00:10:26,474
Sell the convent.
The site is worth millions!

71
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:30,866
I can't do that.
If only I could!

72
00:10:31,008 --> 00:10:34,375
But the Mother General
has been dying for months.

73
00:10:34,474 --> 00:10:38,274
I can't bother her now
with these financial problems.

74
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:41,105
Face reality.
Go back to Albacete.

75
00:10:42,341 --> 00:10:45,401
- This is finished.
- The young need us.

76
00:10:46,274 --> 00:10:49,566
The young?
They want to be left alone.

77
00:10:50,574 --> 00:10:53,475
And anyway, I have no money.

78
00:10:53,574 --> 00:10:56,634
You may not have heard here
about the economic crisis.

79
00:10:56,741 --> 00:11:00,370
- You're a millionairess!
- To survive, one needs to be.

80
00:11:00,507 --> 00:11:05,199
And I don't want just to survive.
I want to live life now!

81
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:09,169
- <i>My Fair Lady</i>  is on again.
- Yes?

82
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,167
You should see it.

83
00:11:11,674 --> 00:11:13,972
We can't afford the cinema.

84
00:11:14,074 --> 00:11:16,565
I'll take you. You'll love it.

85
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:20,540
Your cigarette, Father!

86
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,507
Cecil Beaton
won the Oscar for the costumes.

87
00:11:24,774 --> 00:11:27,140
That man has such good taste!

88
00:11:28,174 --> 00:11:31,007
If you saw the dresses.
And the hats!

89
00:11:31,141 --> 00:11:33,336
Oh, I love hats!

90
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,701
Audrey Hepburn wears a big white hat
with black ribbons, set at an angle.

91
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:44,706
And it's held in place by a white veil
all covered in tiny flowers.

92
00:11:44,807 --> 00:11:45,807
Beautiful!

93
00:11:46,774 --> 00:11:50,801
You describe it so well!
I don't need to see the film.

94
00:11:50,907 --> 00:11:53,398
You must see it.
We'll go together.

95
00:11:54,108 --> 00:11:55,473
Excuse me.

96
00:11:56,607 --> 00:11:58,074
This armchair!

97
00:11:58,907 --> 00:12:01,068
- Good morning, ma'am.
- Hello.

98
00:12:01,174 --> 00:12:03,642
- What a lovely cake.
- I hope you like it.

99
00:12:03,774 --> 00:12:06,038
Take it away, Sister.

100
00:12:06,174 --> 00:12:09,234
The Marquise is on a diet
and doesn't want cake.

101
00:12:09,374 --> 00:12:11,342
What a pity.

102
00:12:11,474 --> 00:12:13,339
We'll eat it ourselves.

103
00:12:17,741 --> 00:12:19,299
Well, I must go.

104
00:12:20,841 --> 00:12:23,469
Take care. You don't look well.

105
00:12:23,574 --> 00:12:26,099
Just now, how I look
is the least of my worries.

106
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:30,008
You're wrong.
A woman's looks are most important.

107
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:39,869
How are you, ma'am?

108
00:12:39,974 --> 00:12:41,942
Aren't you staying for our Mass?

109
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:44,407
No, I've been to so many in my life

110
00:12:44,507 --> 00:12:48,841
I'm sure God will pardon me
if I never go again.

111
00:12:50,907 --> 00:12:52,807
- What's this?
- A present for you.

112
00:12:52,907 --> 00:12:57,931
You really shouldn't have.
How kind of you!

113
00:12:58,041 --> 00:13:01,101
I knew you'd like it.

114
00:13:01,207 --> 00:13:04,472
Multipurpose detergent.
Biodegradable. Open here.

115
00:13:04,574 --> 00:13:06,041
It's great!

116
00:13:06,141 --> 00:13:08,541
- How's the boy?
- Fine, growing every day.

117
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,267
- Do you want to see him?
- Oh, no.

118
00:13:10,407 --> 00:13:12,841
- He mustn't get out.
- No, he's so naughty.

119
00:13:12,974 --> 00:13:17,923
I've forbidden him to touch the chickens
and the rabbits but he won't listen.

120
00:13:17,948 --> 00:13:19,596
It really is a problem.

121
00:13:19,674 --> 00:13:22,905
Yes, but he's shut up in here
and never gets out.

122
00:13:23,574 --> 00:13:24,973
He just wants to play.

123
00:13:25,074 --> 00:13:28,168
Well, God be with you.
We'll see you again soon.

124
00:13:28,273 --> 00:13:30,935
God bless you. I don't think so.

00:15:06,941 --> 00:15:07,965
Hello.

142
00:15:09,607 --> 00:15:12,735
- Do you remember me?
- How could I forget?

143
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,999
Welcome, Yolanda.

144
00:15:16,974 --> 00:15:18,236
Come.

145
00:15:23,774 --> 00:15:25,765
I found your card in my purse, and I...

146
00:15:25,874 --> 00:15:29,742
Don't worry. Come with me.
I'll show you your room.

147
00:16:02,474 --> 00:16:04,169
It's our best room.

148
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,467
I hope you like it.

149
00:16:07,574 --> 00:16:09,166
It's really nice.

150
00:16:10,907 --> 00:16:14,570
I could bring you
a poster of Mick Jagger, if you like.

151
00:16:15,906 --> 00:16:18,602
No, I like it.
It's just... I don't know.

152
00:16:18,774 --> 00:16:20,605
Have a rest.

153
00:16:20,841 --> 00:16:24,174
Have a rest first,
and then you can decide.

154
00:16:40,973 --> 00:16:43,066
Nobody will bother you here.

155
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:58,667
The Marquise has fallen
to the worst vice.

156
00:16:58,774 --> 00:17:00,105
Stinginess.

157
00:17:01,374 --> 00:17:04,400
She's withdrawn her protection.

158
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:07,202
And our beloved Mother General,

159
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:12,070
our only support in the congregation,
is dying.

160
00:17:12,173 --> 00:17:16,000
Times are hard
but I'm not willing to give up.

161
00:17:18,741 --> 00:17:21,301
We haven't redeemed anyone in ages.

162
00:17:21,973 --> 00:17:25,670
But a new girl has
arrived who needs us.

163
00:17:25,774 --> 00:17:27,298
That's wonderful!

164
00:17:27,407 --> 00:17:32,667
We must continue to fight sin,
even if we only have God's help.

165
00:17:33,674 --> 00:17:35,005
Be quiet.

166
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:36,232
Sister Damned!

167
00:17:38,806 --> 00:17:41,707
If any of you wish to leave,
I'll understand.

168
00:17:42,607 --> 00:17:45,804
But I want to know
how many I can rely on.

169
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,940
On all of us, Mother.
God willing.

170
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:52,134
- Until we're kicked out.
- Don't be so pessimistic.

171
00:17:52,273 --> 00:17:53,501
Trust God.

172
00:17:53,674 --> 00:17:57,508
- Who's the new girl?
- A singer, a very good one.

173
00:17:57,607 --> 00:17:59,404
- Will she stay?
- Yes.

174
00:17:59,507 --> 00:18:03,900
I'll introduce you,
but don't bother her, especially you.

175
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,741
Very soon, this place
will be full of murderesses,

176
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,503
drug addicts, prostitutes,
just like before.

177
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:15,336
- Praised be God.
- Sister, go buy some food.

178
00:18:17,374 --> 00:18:22,277
Get some steaks,
some good salami and cheese.

179
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,107
This won't be enough.

180
00:18:24,474 --> 00:18:27,534
Say one of us is sick
and they may take pity.

181
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:32,408
We should paint the walls
before winter comes.

182
00:18:32,507 --> 00:18:35,772
Forget it.
This is a convent, not a palace.

183
00:18:35,873 --> 00:18:39,036
All this cleaning,
as if we'd no other problems!

184
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:40,437
It must be done.

185
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:43,475
- We could sell a chicken.
- Certainly not.

186
00:18:43,574 --> 00:18:45,769
- A rabbit?
- I said no!

187
00:18:45,873 --> 00:18:49,639
Be careful with the boy.
Lock him up.

188
00:18:50,507 --> 00:18:53,533
- The girl mustn't see him.
- Where is she?

189
00:18:54,706 --> 00:18:57,266
I've put her in Virginia's room.

190
00:18:57,374 --> 00:18:59,604
- In Virginia's room?
- Yes.

191
00:18:59,706 --> 00:19:02,140
It's high time we started using it.

192
00:19:12,639 --> 00:19:16,131
- Hello. Do you like it?
- Yes.

193
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,832
A nun painted it.

194
00:19:19,107 --> 00:19:22,668
Your dress is lovely,
but this is more comfortable.

195
00:19:22,806 --> 00:19:24,569
Don't worry about me.

196
00:19:26,307 --> 00:19:28,605
Did you rest?

197
00:19:28,706 --> 00:19:31,334
The bed's never been used.

198
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,204
The nun who lived here
slept on the floor.

199
00:19:35,806 --> 00:19:38,437
- What is it?
- I must go.

200
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,172
- Where?
- I don't know.

201
00:19:44,007 --> 00:19:48,171
You can leave when you want,
but this isn't the best time.

202
00:19:49,606 --> 00:19:53,042
- I've something to calm you.
- What are you going to do?

203
00:19:55,706 --> 00:19:57,936
- Don't you trust me?
- No.

204
00:19:59,374 --> 00:20:02,573
- It's just heroin.
- What is this?

205
00:20:03,207 --> 00:20:05,869
I'll go first so you needn't be scared.

206
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,465
Now let me do it.

207
00:20:38,573 --> 00:20:41,098
I brought you a new needle.

208
00:20:44,107 --> 00:20:47,304
<i>One day you'll get tired and leave.</i>

209
00:20:47,407 --> 00:20:50,171
<i>So I must have my revenge
before you go.</i>

210
00:20:51,639 --> 00:20:55,803
<i>You're the highest price
I've ever paid for heroin.</i>

211
00:21:00,073 --> 00:21:01,139
<i>I</i>

212
00:21:01,564 --> 00:21:03,294
<i>am</i>

213
00:21:03,374 --> 00:21:05,706
<i>dead.</i>

214
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:08,468
<i>Yolanda</i>

215
00:21:08,573 --> 00:21:10,507
<i>has made me</i>

216
00:21:10,606 --> 00:21:13,200
<i>kill myself.</i>

217
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,372
- Did you bring it?
- Yes.

218
00:21:41,473 --> 00:21:42,997
And there's a review too.

219
00:21:43,107 --> 00:21:44,904
- How is it?
- So-so.

220
00:21:45,007 --> 00:21:47,601
What did you expect?
A literary prize?

221
00:21:49,706 --> 00:21:51,765
- Is that all?
- For now, yes.

222
00:21:54,173 --> 00:21:57,564
Got any new ideas?
They're waiting.

223
00:21:57,673 --> 00:22:00,506
We're going through a bad patch.

224
00:22:00,606 --> 00:22:04,633
There's a new girl,
but I don't think it'll help.

225
00:22:04,773 --> 00:22:06,707
I just don't know.

226
00:22:06,773 --> 00:22:10,834
Sometimes I think I should give this up
and start again.

227
00:22:11,439 --> 00:22:14,840
Don't be silly!
It's too late to change.

228
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:16,430
Your place is here.

229
00:22:16,539 --> 00:22:19,508
And where could you go?
You're 48 years old.

230
00:22:19,606 --> 00:22:22,700
I beg your pardon,
but I'm only 47!

231
00:22:24,073 --> 00:22:25,938
Move over a bit!

232
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:29,498
The plant keeps hitting
you in the mustache!

233
00:22:30,107 --> 00:22:34,205
- Sister, bring out the reliquary.
- It's on the cabinet.

234
00:22:34,307 --> 00:22:35,934
- The reliquary?
- Yes.

235
00:22:36,573 --> 00:22:40,509
Times have changed.
Life isn't the same.

236
00:22:40,573 --> 00:22:44,475
Listen, all that is just a nun's fantasy.

237
00:22:44,573 --> 00:22:45,837
You're all crazy.

238
00:22:45,862 --> 00:22:49,654
You never go out, so you think
things have changed outside.

239
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,708
Nothing has changed.
Not a thing.

240
00:22:51,806 --> 00:22:56,402
Everything is exactly the same
as when you came in here.

241
00:22:57,539 --> 00:22:59,029
Why?

242
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:01,700
Because I say so.
I live outside, and I know.

243
00:23:03,973 --> 00:23:05,167
Come in.

244
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,405
Hello!

245
00:23:09,506 --> 00:23:12,942
I'm Sister Rat of the Sewers.
I was keen to meet you.

246
00:23:14,306 --> 00:23:16,274
You like painting?

247
00:23:16,406 --> 00:23:18,306
It passes the time.

248
00:23:18,406 --> 00:23:21,273
That's the painting
Virginia never finished.

249
00:23:22,073 --> 00:23:25,008
- Who's Virginia?
- The Marquise's daughter.

250
00:23:25,573 --> 00:23:28,133
She was a nun in this convent.

251
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,261
Her father furnished this room
just like hers at home,

252
00:23:32,286 --> 00:23:34,463
so she wouldn't miss anything.

253
00:23:34,539 --> 00:23:37,303
But she didn't want
to be reminded of him.

254
00:23:37,406 --> 00:23:39,738
On the contrary.

255
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,432
Where is she now?

256
00:23:42,107 --> 00:23:43,734
She went to Africa.

257
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,775
And the cannibals ate her.

258
00:23:47,573 --> 00:23:49,507
Let's change the subject.

259
00:23:50,131 --> 00:23:52,131
Look at this.

260
00:23:54,506 --> 00:23:58,237
I know you're a singer.
I'm glad you came.

261
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:00,805
I've never met a singer.

262
00:24:02,339 --> 00:24:03,704
I'm the gardener.

263
00:24:03,806 --> 00:24:05,603
Come and see me in the orchard.

264
00:24:05,706 --> 00:24:07,901
I will. I love plants.

265
00:24:08,007 --> 00:24:12,205
Before I became a singer,
I taught natural sciences.

266
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,669
You don't look like you did.

267
00:24:14,773 --> 00:24:17,936
I don't like plants.
They bore me.

268
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:21,234
And it's a lie that they
communicate with us.

269
00:24:22,373 --> 00:24:24,034
I don't smoke.

270
00:24:24,172 --> 00:24:28,108
I'm going to leave you a book,
in case you get bored.

271
00:24:31,107 --> 00:24:32,802
Tear off the paper.

272
00:24:38,406 --> 00:24:40,203
- "Get Out of Here, Pig!"
- Yes.

273
00:24:40,306 --> 00:24:44,439
- I love sensationalist literature.
- So do I.

274
00:24:44,539 --> 00:24:47,599
Don't tell anyone.
It's a secret.

275
00:24:47,706 --> 00:24:50,800
If they should find it,
say you brought it.

276
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:53,408
I must go. I'm in a hurry.

277
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:03,875
Praised be God.
May His name ever be blessed.

278
00:25:06,439 --> 00:25:09,374
- Coming!
- I'll get it.

279
00:25:14,007 --> 00:25:16,703
I was expecting you
the day before yesterday.

280
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:18,637
There was a big fuck-up.

281
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:21,436
Hello, Lola. Lovely to see you.

282
00:25:21,539 --> 00:25:23,029
Come with me.

283
00:25:23,573 --> 00:25:26,667
Sister Rat was in Yolanda's room.

284
00:25:27,439 --> 00:25:28,997
We'll talk later.

285
00:25:30,306 --> 00:25:31,534
Well?

286
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:34,932
Remember the girl you liked so much?

287
00:25:35,072 --> 00:25:39,404
- The singer. Yolanda.
- Yes. Well?

288
00:25:39,506 --> 00:25:41,064
Her boyfriend's dead.

289
00:25:41,172 --> 00:25:44,198
- Heroin with strychnine.
- Sit down.

290
00:25:45,973 --> 00:25:49,841
Someone else died too,
and the cops are after her.

291
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:53,535
- So she's on the lam.
- Really?

292
00:25:53,639 --> 00:25:56,802
We must be careful,
they're raiding everywhere.

293
00:25:57,406 --> 00:26:01,867
I only hope they catch the
bastard who's pushing it!

294
00:26:02,007 --> 00:26:07,798
- You think she was involved with it?
- I don't know. She was his chick.

295
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:11,205
And she did a bit of dealing.

296
00:26:11,306 --> 00:26:14,807
So the cops want to find her
and rough her up a bit.

297
00:26:16,506 --> 00:26:19,600
Is this all right?

298
00:26:19,706 --> 00:26:23,403
One of my pals is a chemist
and he checks all my stuff.

299
00:26:29,639 --> 00:26:33,131
- I'll snort some to prove it.
- No, I trust you.

300
00:26:33,272 --> 00:26:36,673
- I will, anyway.
- How much did you bring?

301
00:26:37,639 --> 00:26:40,769
- Three grams.
- They may be the last.

302
00:26:42,573 --> 00:26:45,269
- How come?
- We have no money.

303
00:26:45,373 --> 00:26:47,534
I daren't sell anything else.

304
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,468
I could fix up some deals for you.

305
00:26:51,573 --> 00:26:54,599
- You?
- Sure. Bringing stuff in.

306
00:26:54,706 --> 00:26:56,503
It would be dead easy for a nun.

307
00:26:56,606 --> 00:26:59,074
- That's nonsense!
- Yeah?

308
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:06,807
"Get Out of Here, Pig!
By the mysterious Concha Torres."

309
00:27:10,873 --> 00:27:13,307
"Drug addict found dead
in his apartment."

310
00:27:13,439 --> 00:27:15,464
"Jorge Muelle, 33 years old."

311
00:27:16,139 --> 00:27:20,576
Come on, give me some acid
for Sister Manure.

312
00:27:21,706 --> 00:27:24,769
- She's still tripping?
 - Yes.

313
00:27:27,773 --> 00:27:30,936
These are just like in the '60s.
Far out.

314
00:27:31,072 --> 00:27:32,334
Like really far out.

315
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:36,573
- We must watch the cops.
- Don't worry.

316
00:27:36,773 --> 00:27:38,707
We're real safe in here.

317
00:27:40,539 --> 00:27:41,539
Hello.

318
00:27:43,239 --> 00:27:44,797
Why was she here?

319
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,638
- Do you know her?
- I've seen her before.

320
00:27:49,706 --> 00:27:52,266
She was one of our girls.

321
00:27:52,373 --> 00:27:55,171
They often come to see
the Mother Superior.

322
00:27:57,072 --> 00:28:00,564
She's still their spiritual guide.

323
00:28:00,673 --> 00:28:01,901
So I see.

324
00:28:03,306 --> 00:28:04,898
She saved me too.

325
00:28:06,606 --> 00:28:09,666
Soon after I came to Madrid,
I knifed a man.

326
00:28:12,139 --> 00:28:14,607
She lied in court for me.

327
00:28:16,506 --> 00:28:18,940
I owe her everything.

328
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:21,530
I'd do anything for her.

329
00:28:21,673 --> 00:28:23,732
Why tell me all this?

330
00:28:25,473 --> 00:28:28,806
Because I'm a murderess
and deserve no pity.

331
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:35,903
The Mother Superior
has put her hopes in you.

332
00:28:37,639 --> 00:28:40,301
- Don't disappoint her.
- Me?

333
00:28:43,473 --> 00:28:47,170
We'd like you to dine with us tonight.

334
00:28:47,272 --> 00:28:49,433
I've baked a lovely cake.

335
00:28:49,539 --> 00:28:51,268
We can't let it go stale.

336
00:29:09,206 --> 00:29:11,106
Leave it.

337
00:29:11,206 --> 00:29:13,071
Don't eat any more.

338
00:29:13,172 --> 00:29:14,799
You don't like it.

339
00:29:16,706 --> 00:29:18,230
Here, have this.

340
00:29:19,706 --> 00:29:21,173
You must eat.

341
00:29:22,905 --> 00:29:25,772
We have to do penance,
but you don't.

342
00:29:27,172 --> 00:29:32,434
One of the bases of our community
is self-mortification and humiliation.

343
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:38,132
That's why we have such
bizarre-sounding names.

344
00:29:39,339 --> 00:29:40,806
Sister Manure.

345
00:29:42,172 --> 00:29:45,496
- Sister Rat.
- Your servant.

346
00:29:45,606 --> 00:29:47,198
Sister Damned, Sister Snake.

347
00:29:48,905 --> 00:29:56,671
Man will not be saved until he realizes he
is the most despicable being ever created.

348
00:30:02,839 --> 00:30:06,270
- Here, Mother.
- No, thank you.

349
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:09,107
Today's an exception.

350
00:30:09,206 --> 00:30:12,642
- We have Yolanda with us.
- Leftovers will do me.

351
00:30:12,739 --> 00:30:14,604
Just the cherry.

352
00:30:16,272 --> 00:30:20,803
At this rate
you soon won't be able to eat.

353
00:30:21,638 --> 00:30:23,162
I hope so.

354
00:30:23,306 --> 00:30:26,104
She sometimes forgets she's human.

355
00:30:26,206 --> 00:30:28,766
The simple fact is that she's a saint.

356
00:30:28,905 --> 00:30:30,566
Saints have to eat.

357
00:30:32,672 --> 00:30:36,073
Eating this is like taking communion.

358
00:30:37,805 --> 00:30:41,036
Jesus appeared to me
while I was making it.

359
00:30:42,872 --> 00:30:46,899
He offered me his wounds to suck,
like a swallow.

360
00:30:47,006 --> 00:30:48,940
That's called a hallucination.

361
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:52,600
May God bless
that kind of hallucination.

362
00:30:53,172 --> 00:30:54,298
I'll have some.

363
00:30:54,572 --> 00:30:57,632
Then we'll have some too.

364
00:31:00,539 --> 00:31:02,564
Sister Manure made it.

365
00:31:02,705 --> 00:31:05,640
She can't do much else,
but she's a great cook.

366
00:31:06,572 --> 00:31:08,870
It looks delicious.

367
00:31:16,439 --> 00:31:18,873
She looks very pale.

368
00:31:19,772 --> 00:31:21,501
And the other one...

369
00:31:40,306 --> 00:31:41,796
I was afraid of this!

370
00:31:42,172 --> 00:31:45,062
- He's harmless.
- Boy! What is this?

371
00:31:45,172 --> 00:31:47,800
I told you not to move.

372
00:31:47,905 --> 00:31:50,533
He's been locked up all day
and he's nervous.

373
00:31:50,638 --> 00:31:52,799
Come on, baby.
You just calm down.

374
00:31:52,905 --> 00:31:57,467
I'll give you supper
and we'll take a walk.

375
00:31:57,572 --> 00:32:01,030
Look! See the lovely lady
who's come to see you?

376
00:32:01,139 --> 00:32:02,606
She's a singer, you know.

377
00:32:04,972 --> 00:32:09,106
- That really gave me a fright!
- Take it easy. You'll be fine.

378
00:32:10,472 --> 00:32:14,238
I'd be scared too.
Seeing a tiger in a convent!

379
00:32:14,339 --> 00:32:18,332
- One of our girls brought him.
- I'll explain it to her.

380
00:32:19,672 --> 00:32:23,833
He came here as a pup.
Sister Damned reared him.

381
00:32:23,939 --> 00:32:27,272
A few years ago,
animals were in fashion.

382
00:32:28,006 --> 00:32:33,033
When the girl left he was so big,
we decided to keep him.

383
00:32:33,538 --> 00:32:36,098
Sister Damned loves him like a son.

384
00:32:36,206 --> 00:32:38,538
- Is he really harmless?
- Yes.

385
00:32:38,672 --> 00:32:42,199
- If you don't attack him.
- I wasn't going to.

386
00:32:42,339 --> 00:32:44,204
You'll get used to him.

387
00:32:45,438 --> 00:32:46,769
We all did.

388
00:32:47,939 --> 00:32:50,669
Pies! Cakes!

389
00:32:50,772 --> 00:32:54,003
Miraculous cakes
made with the body of Christ!

390
00:32:54,106 --> 00:32:56,131
Hush! They'll think we're mad!

391
00:32:56,872 --> 00:32:58,931
- Cakes.
- Flowers.

392
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:00,939
- Peppers.
- Cakes.

393
00:33:00,963 --> 00:33:02,963
- Flowers.
- Peppers.

394
00:33:42,739 --> 00:33:45,264
<i>Perhaps</i>

395
00:33:45,405 --> 00:33:49,171
<i>it would be better
if you didn't come back</i>

396
00:33:50,072 --> 00:33:54,372
<i>Perhaps it would be
better if you forgot me</i>

397
00:33:54,972 --> 00:33:59,671
<i>We'd only torture ourselves again</i>

398
00:33:59,772 --> 00:34:02,502
<i>our love would only turn</i>

399
00:34:02,605 --> 00:34:05,631
<i>into an everlasting hatred</i>

400
00:34:05,739 --> 00:34:11,999
<i>We've hurt each other
so very much</i>

401
00:34:12,106 --> 00:34:16,133
<i>that loving each other is a torment</i>

402
00:34:16,872 --> 00:34:21,332
<i>Disillusion, forgetfulness and madness</i>

403
00:34:21,438 --> 00:34:24,601
<i>are always around the corner</i>

404
00:34:24,705 --> 00:34:27,572
<i>We'll never change</i>

405
00:34:28,338 --> 00:34:29,737
<i>Sweetheart</i>

406
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:33,639
<i>a love like ours is a punishment</i>

407
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:38,608
<i>that will continue until death takes us</i>

408
00:34:39,106 --> 00:34:44,405
<i>My fate needs your fate</i>

409
00:34:44,505 --> 00:34:49,272
<i>and you need me much more</i>

410
00:34:50,139 --> 00:34:56,200
<i>That is why we'll
never say good-bye</i>

411
00:34:56,305 --> 00:35:00,639
<i>and why peace will never be ours</i>

412
00:35:00,772 --> 00:35:05,675
<i>Pain will always find us</i>

413
00:35:05,805 --> 00:35:08,296
<i>kneeling in life</i>

414
00:35:08,405 --> 00:35:12,637
<i>in simple confrontation</i>

415
00:35:13,305 --> 00:35:15,603
You've got my entire repertoire.

416
00:35:16,839 --> 00:35:19,399
I love all that sentimental music.

417
00:35:19,505 --> 00:35:23,601
Boleros, tangos, merengue, salsa.
All of that.

418
00:35:23,705 --> 00:35:27,664
It's music that really
tells the truth about life.

419
00:35:27,772 --> 00:35:32,430
Because all of us have been in love
or been deceived.

420
00:35:33,772 --> 00:35:36,605
You look lovely this morning.

421
00:35:37,739 --> 00:35:39,172
No, I look terrible.

422
00:35:39,271 --> 00:35:42,331
No, not at all!
I like you like that.

423
00:35:43,372 --> 00:35:46,808
There's so much beauty
in physical deterioration.

424
00:35:47,405 --> 00:35:50,033
As a child,
I wanted to look haggard.

425
00:35:50,138 --> 00:35:51,765
But I never could.

426
00:35:52,739 --> 00:35:54,673
I was always very plump.

427
00:35:55,705 --> 00:35:58,672
But when I was ill,

428
00:35:58,697 --> 00:36:02,552
I'd spend the whole day
looking at myself in the mirror delighted.

429
00:36:03,805 --> 00:36:06,049
When I was little
they called me Snot,

430
00:36:06,074 --> 00:36:09,440
because I had such a bad color.

431
00:36:09,665 --> 00:36:11,359
Really?

432
00:36:12,972 --> 00:36:15,873
Some of this century's great sinners.

433
00:36:15,972 --> 00:36:18,634
- You wonder why I have them?
- Yes, I do.

434
00:36:19,705 --> 00:36:24,863
It is in imperfect creatures
that God finds all His greatness.

435
00:36:26,739 --> 00:36:30,266
Jesus didn't die on the cross
to save saints.

436
00:36:30,405 --> 00:36:32,339
but to redeem sinners.

437
00:36:35,271 --> 00:36:39,469
When I look at some of these women
I feel very grateful to them.

438
00:36:40,638 --> 00:36:42,230
Thanks to them,

439
00:36:43,505 --> 00:36:46,838
God dies and comes
back to life every day.

440
00:36:58,105 --> 00:37:01,871
- Any of the sisters do smack?
- No.

441
00:37:01,972 --> 00:37:06,375
Only Sister Manure
takes acid occasionally.

442
00:37:07,205 --> 00:37:09,196
Yeah, I realized that.

443
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:11,773
Why do you ask?

444
00:37:11,872 --> 00:37:15,308
When we threw up,
they didn't seem surprised.

445
00:37:15,405 --> 00:37:18,602
But they don't know
it's because of heroin.

446
00:37:18,705 --> 00:37:23,165
They're used to seeing me,
but they don't know why.

447
00:37:26,238 --> 00:37:28,433
Are you happy here?

448
00:37:28,538 --> 00:37:31,029
Happy? I don't know.

449
00:37:33,138 --> 00:37:36,869
- I do all I can.
- It doesn't depend on you.

450
00:37:38,638 --> 00:37:41,402
<i>One part of me needs you,</i>

451
00:37:41,538 --> 00:37:43,301
<i>the other hates you!</i>

452
00:37:43,405 --> 00:37:45,305
<i>And I hate both parts.</i>

453
00:37:45,405 --> 00:37:48,768
<i>Nothing affects you.
Not even drugs.</i>

454
00:37:48,872 --> 00:37:51,898
- Am I disturbing you?
- No, come in.

455
00:37:52,005 --> 00:37:54,906
The Mother Superior sent these.

456
00:37:55,005 --> 00:37:56,768
Where will I put them?

457
00:37:57,705 --> 00:37:59,639
Put them under the Virgin.

458
00:38:03,638 --> 00:38:06,505
There's a card too.

459
00:38:07,605 --> 00:38:09,197
Leave it there.

460
00:38:09,305 --> 00:38:12,797
I'm going to sit down for a while.
I'm bored.

461
00:38:15,672 --> 00:38:17,731
- Did you read the book?
- Yes.

462
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:21,172
Did you like it?
It's very good, isn't it?

463
00:38:21,271 --> 00:38:22,738
I'll hide it.

464
00:38:24,405 --> 00:38:25,770
Do you need anything?

465
00:38:26,672 --> 00:38:28,970
I'll go, you're not very chatty.

466
00:38:30,805 --> 00:38:34,036
If you need anything, just tell me.

467
00:38:35,105 --> 00:38:36,402
All right.

468
00:38:39,171 --> 00:38:44,172
"There are as many kinds of kisses
as kinds of love.

469
00:38:44,271 --> 00:38:47,536
"The paternal kiss on the forehead.

470
00:38:48,071 --> 00:38:51,862
"The kiss on the eyes
full of peace.

471
00:38:52,005 --> 00:38:55,532
"The amusing kiss on the nose.

472
00:38:55,672 --> 00:38:59,870
"The friendly kiss on the cheek.

473
00:38:59,971 --> 00:39:02,804
"All of these are somewhat anodyne,

474
00:39:02,904 --> 00:39:06,271
"but they could be taken
as tempting invitations

475
00:39:06,372 --> 00:39:09,034
"to more perfidious ones

476
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:12,403
"such as the indiscreet kiss
on the throat

477
00:39:13,105 --> 00:39:15,972
"or the coaxing kiss in the ear

478
00:39:16,105 --> 00:39:20,201
"which is like being told a secret.

479
00:39:21,572 --> 00:39:28,437
"And finally
there is the kiss on the lips.

480
00:39:28,538 --> 00:39:33,066
"'A kiss means nothing,'
say the thoughtless.

481
00:39:33,171 --> 00:39:36,767
"Perhaps not
if you are cold as ice

482
00:39:36,871 --> 00:39:39,840
"and your companion,
lacking in ardor

483
00:39:39,938 --> 00:39:43,339
"lets you escape easily
from his embrace.

484
00:39:44,438 --> 00:39:49,904
"But if that kiss
has filled you with delight,

485
00:39:50,005 --> 00:39:55,834
"bear in mind that
it has moved him even more strongly

486
00:39:55,971 --> 00:40:00,738
"and awoken all the strength
of his desire."

487
00:40:02,438 --> 00:40:08,541
"Do not give a kiss, my friend
without a ring on your finger."

488
00:40:08,638 --> 00:40:13,144
"This is a piece of advice
sung in Faust

489
00:40:13,169 --> 00:40:16,099
"by the very Devil himself."

490
00:40:19,371 --> 00:40:21,562
"The big offenses."

491
00:40:22,904 --> 00:40:28,202
"Blond Elda and all her daughters
easily fall for them."

492
00:40:29,672 --> 00:40:32,106
They're up to something.

493
00:40:32,205 --> 00:40:33,866
How do you mean?

494
00:40:34,005 --> 00:40:37,463
Yolanda gave something to Sister Rat.

495
00:40:37,572 --> 00:40:39,301
- What?
- I don't know.

496
00:40:41,005 --> 00:40:43,496
She must have hidden it in her cell.

497
00:40:45,138 --> 00:40:46,901
That's enough.

498
00:40:47,005 --> 00:40:49,906
Now, meditate on what we have heard.

499
00:41:13,771 --> 00:41:18,603
If I catch you at the hens again
I'll go to Albacete.

500
00:41:18,704 --> 00:41:22,333
And what will you do then?
You're just a nuisance.

501
00:41:28,372 --> 00:41:31,739
You like to hear the drums, don't you?

502
00:41:33,105 --> 00:41:35,835
They remind you of Africa.

503
00:41:35,971 --> 00:41:40,496
And don't scratch me, you hear?
See what you've done.

504
00:41:41,604 --> 00:41:45,700
It looks awful.
I'm ashamed to go out.

505
00:41:45,804 --> 00:41:49,865
The other day, the butcher
asked what had happened to me.

506
00:41:49,971 --> 00:41:52,500
It was embarrassing.

507
00:41:52,524 --> 00:41:55,424
You can't do this to me.
Understand?

508
00:41:55,472 --> 00:41:58,202
And all the poor animals...

509
00:41:58,305 --> 00:42:01,069
Now, I warned you!
Take that paw back!

510
00:42:01,171 --> 00:42:05,769
Sister Damned, would you give me
some of his leftovers?

511
00:42:05,871 --> 00:42:10,305
- He doesn't leave any.
- Then give me some now.

512
00:42:10,438 --> 00:42:13,430
I can cook it now,
the kitchen's empty.

513
00:42:13,571 --> 00:42:17,974
All right, but don't make a habit of it.

514
00:42:18,071 --> 00:42:22,906
- No, give me that bit.
- Look, he isn't pleased.

515
00:42:22,930 --> 00:42:24,304
Here.

516
00:42:24,305 --> 00:42:28,935
I'm sick of mortifying myself,
always eating vegetables.

517
00:42:34,138 --> 00:42:36,868
Stop it! I've told you about that!

518
00:42:37,704 --> 00:42:39,035
Like this?

519
00:42:40,771 --> 00:42:43,797
Yes, well done.
You're getting better every day.

520
00:42:43,938 --> 00:42:47,032
Why don't you learn to cut out?

521
00:42:47,305 --> 00:42:49,068
- Hello.
- Hello.

522
00:42:50,305 --> 00:42:53,706
- May I have one?
- Can you sew, Yolanda?

523
00:42:53,804 --> 00:42:55,704
Sort of.

524
00:42:55,804 --> 00:42:58,864
- I'll teach you, if you want.
- Great!

525
00:42:58,971 --> 00:43:01,872
It's very good for you,
calms the nerves.

526
00:43:01,971 --> 00:43:06,336
I learned in order to stop smoking.
To keep my hands busy.

527
00:43:06,438 --> 00:43:07,530
What's all this?

528
00:43:08,604 --> 00:43:11,368
Of course, she's never seen them.

529
00:43:11,504 --> 00:43:15,406
They're robes for the Virgins,
designed by Sister Snake.

530
00:43:15,537 --> 00:43:17,732
They're out of sight, really.

531
00:43:17,838 --> 00:43:20,602
Out of sight?
Do you mean you like them?

532
00:43:20,704 --> 00:43:22,262
I love them.

533
00:43:22,405 --> 00:43:24,236
Our girls made them.

534
00:43:24,338 --> 00:43:27,671
They have great sentimental value for us.

535
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:32,633
The Church has evolved in all aspects
except that of images.

536
00:43:32,738 --> 00:43:37,175
Yet I think the ornamental aspect
is linked to piety.

537
00:43:37,271 --> 00:43:41,503
Sister Snake has designed an outfit
for each season.

538
00:43:41,604 --> 00:43:44,266
These are for fall and winter.

539
00:43:44,404 --> 00:43:48,170
We must change with the
times, mustn't we?

540
00:43:48,305 --> 00:43:53,463
A purple Lurex cape
with a matching Lurex veil.

541
00:43:53,604 --> 00:43:58,007
- And the skirt...
- Valenciennes, silver and gold.

542
00:43:59,305 --> 00:44:02,638
For Our Lady of the Forsaken.

543
00:44:02,738 --> 00:44:07,367
- Our Lady of the Forsaken!
- I'm devoted to her.

544
00:44:07,471 --> 00:44:09,837
So was my mother.

545
00:44:09,938 --> 00:44:13,465
Next year, metal fabrics
will be all the fashion.

546
00:44:21,005 --> 00:44:22,700
What are you eating?

547
00:44:24,504 --> 00:44:27,439
Me? Spinach.

548
00:44:27,571 --> 00:44:28,902
Spinach?

549
00:44:29,005 --> 00:44:30,939
I'm hungry.

550
00:44:31,038 --> 00:44:35,299
- We must suffer.
- I'll suffer later.

551
00:44:35,404 --> 00:44:36,871
Look at me.

552
00:44:38,105 --> 00:44:39,970
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!

553
00:44:47,404 --> 00:44:52,762
Not again! I cleaned the kitchen
this morning and now look at it.

554
00:44:52,904 --> 00:44:54,895
That's enough.
You've earned Heaven.

555
00:44:55,038 --> 00:44:58,838
- Let's fix lunch.
- No, leave it to me.

556
00:44:58,938 --> 00:45:00,428
I'll do it.

557
00:45:00,571 --> 00:45:02,596
I feel a vision coming on.

558
00:45:02,704 --> 00:45:07,138
Okay, but use this knife instead.
You'll cut yourself with that one.

559
00:45:07,238 --> 00:45:09,468
What if I do?

560
00:45:09,571 --> 00:45:11,835
Why punish yourself so?

561
00:45:11,938 --> 00:45:15,931
Sacrifice is all very well,
but damaging your health...

562
00:45:16,038 --> 00:45:19,066
- I'm a murderess.
- So what?

563
00:45:20,270 --> 00:45:24,695
- I'll pay for it in this life.
- As you wish.

564
00:45:24,804 --> 00:45:26,669
You're dribbling.

565
00:45:27,738 --> 00:45:29,467
Come to the bedroom.

566
00:45:31,171 --> 00:45:33,332
She messes up the whole convent.

567
00:45:33,437 --> 00:45:36,031
So what?
You're obsessed with cleaning.

568
00:45:36,138 --> 00:45:40,268
It's not that.
What if she gets an infection?

569
00:45:40,371 --> 00:45:42,032
God be with you.

570
00:45:45,138 --> 00:45:48,403
There's nothing in Sister Rat's cell.

571
00:45:48,504 --> 00:45:52,595
- Are you sure you saw something?
- Absolutely.

572
00:45:52,704 --> 00:45:56,663
Maybe you just imagined it.
Had you taken anything?

573
00:45:56,771 --> 00:45:59,763
No. I've just taken it.

574
00:45:59,904 --> 00:46:02,338
I'm having a vision now.

575
00:46:02,471 --> 00:46:04,234
I'll leave you, then.

576
00:46:16,537 --> 00:46:18,596
Why are you up there?

577
00:46:18,704 --> 00:46:20,365
No reason.

578
00:46:20,471 --> 00:46:22,530
Get down at once!

579
00:46:25,504 --> 00:46:28,003
- What's this?
- A notebook.

580
00:46:28,028 --> 00:46:30,026
I can see that much!

581
00:46:31,671 --> 00:46:35,437
"Virginia didn't use the bed,
but Yolanda does."

582
00:46:36,237 --> 00:46:39,263
"They both like Lucho Gatica."

583
00:46:39,371 --> 00:46:43,032
- What is this about?
- Thoughts of mine.

584
00:46:43,137 --> 00:46:47,837
Leave Virginia's memory alone!
And what about Yolanda?

585
00:46:47,938 --> 00:46:49,633
Nothing.

586
00:46:49,738 --> 00:46:51,262
It's just that...

587
00:46:51,371 --> 00:46:55,671
as she's in the same room,
I think about her a lot.

588
00:46:56,704 --> 00:46:58,467
Don't be so childish!

589
00:46:59,971 --> 00:47:01,700
Move out of the way!

590
00:47:03,671 --> 00:47:05,536
What is this?

591
00:47:06,504 --> 00:47:08,131
"I Am Not A Dream."

592
00:47:08,270 --> 00:47:11,398
"Lost In The Big City,"
"The Call of the Flesh."

593
00:47:12,204 --> 00:47:13,967
"Secretaries Cry Too."

594
00:47:14,071 --> 00:47:17,329
- What are these?
- They're novels.

595
00:47:17,437 --> 00:47:19,928
Yes, but why did you hide them?

596
00:47:20,038 --> 00:47:23,970
- Well, I'm a bit embarrassed.
- Embarrassed!

597
00:47:26,637 --> 00:47:28,127
I'm taking them.

598
00:47:28,237 --> 00:47:31,035
- What will you do with them?
- I don't know.

599
00:47:32,070 --> 00:47:33,799
We'll talk tomorrow.

600
00:47:35,738 --> 00:47:38,639
You have a pitiful taste in novels.

601
00:47:39,904 --> 00:47:41,997
I never said otherwise.

602
00:47:42,137 --> 00:47:45,468
Then why hide them?
You always liked mysteries.

603
00:47:45,571 --> 00:47:49,405
That isn't true, but I'm shy.
You know that.

604
00:47:49,504 --> 00:47:53,031
I wouldn't say you're shy.
Quite the opposite.

605
00:47:53,137 --> 00:47:55,503
I try to overcome it.

606
00:47:55,604 --> 00:47:59,938
I won't hide it any longer.
I wrote those books.

607
00:48:00,037 --> 00:48:03,297
- What?
- Yes, I use a pen name.

608
00:48:03,404 --> 00:48:06,703
My sister deals with the publisher.

609
00:48:06,804 --> 00:48:10,570
You're not a writer!
You've got no imagination.

610
00:48:10,671 --> 00:48:12,070
I don't need any.

611
00:48:12,170 --> 00:48:15,537
I used the stories of
girls who stayed here.

612
00:48:15,637 --> 00:48:17,935
Didn't they sound familiar?

613
00:48:18,037 --> 00:48:21,632
How could you do that?
You're just a leech!

614
00:48:21,738 --> 00:48:23,968
Many nuns have been great writers.

615
00:48:24,070 --> 00:48:27,130
That is not your case!
If the girls find out...

616
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:32,062
- Why not write about your own life?
- My life isn't interesting.

617
00:48:32,170 --> 00:48:36,604
- Then why don't you leave the convent?
- I intend to.

618
00:48:36,704 --> 00:48:39,502
I'm going to Africa,
to the missions.

619
00:48:39,604 --> 00:48:41,435
To the missions?

620
00:48:42,004 --> 00:48:45,371
Of course.
You'd be bored here or in Albacete.

621
00:48:45,471 --> 00:48:48,634
Very well, I'll write to them
to let them know you're going.

622
00:48:48,771 --> 00:48:51,604
Now, listen to me very carefully.

623
00:48:51,704 --> 00:48:55,731
You're not to write a word
about Virginia and Yolanda.

624
00:48:56,804 --> 00:48:58,465
Don't worry.

625
00:48:58,571 --> 00:49:02,166
As a writer and as a nun,
I'm having a crisis.

626
00:49:02,270 --> 00:49:04,704
I'll never write about anyone again.

627
00:49:04,804 --> 00:49:07,796
- How can I believe you?
- Just believe me.

628
00:49:07,904 --> 00:49:11,905
- I'll take the books.
- If I were to tell the Mother General!

629
00:49:12,004 --> 00:49:16,267
If she weren't dying,
there's a lot she'd like to know.

630
00:49:16,404 --> 00:49:19,339
Really? What do you mean?

631
00:49:19,471 --> 00:49:21,268
I think you know.

632
00:49:21,371 --> 00:49:25,808
- Are you threatening me?
- No, Julia, I'm your friend.

633
00:49:25,937 --> 00:49:28,838
- We were novices together.
- Don't get sentimental.

634
00:49:28,937 --> 00:49:33,203
I've often wondered
why you don't like me anymore.

635
00:49:33,304 --> 00:49:35,966
- You must be jealous.
- Jealous?

636
00:49:36,571 --> 00:49:37,970
Of what?

637
00:49:38,070 --> 00:49:42,507
You didn't like the fact
that the girls preferred me to you.

638
00:49:43,304 --> 00:49:45,864
That's enough for today.

639
00:49:45,970 --> 00:49:48,404
Leave me. I have a lot to do.

640
00:49:50,337 --> 00:49:53,500
- God be with you.
- And with you.

641
00:49:55,870 --> 00:49:57,861
Why did you tell?

642
00:49:58,004 --> 00:50:00,404
Me? Tell what to who?

643
00:50:00,504 --> 00:50:03,564
You told the Mother Superior
it was my book.

644
00:50:03,671 --> 00:50:05,468
- I did not!
- No?

645
00:50:05,571 --> 00:50:08,472
- No!
- Then it was Sister Manure.

646
00:50:21,170 --> 00:50:22,364
What are you up to?

647
00:50:22,504 --> 00:50:24,699
Burning these books.

648
00:50:24,803 --> 00:50:27,897
Like the Inquisition!
Who wrote them?

649
00:50:28,004 --> 00:50:30,370
Concha Torres, a dreadful writer.

650
00:50:31,004 --> 00:50:34,064
Well, my favorite writer!

651
00:50:34,170 --> 00:50:36,035
- You know her?
- Yes.

652
00:50:36,137 --> 00:50:38,628
Let me see.
I'd love to read them.

653
00:50:38,738 --> 00:50:43,038
- Really? But they're rubbish.
- That's why I like them.

654
00:50:43,137 --> 00:50:48,437
- Serious books put me to sleep.
- All right. I'll burn them later.

655
00:50:48,970 --> 00:50:52,633
- Is there any dope?
- Only enough for you.

656
00:50:53,137 --> 00:50:57,073
- You'll have to buy some.
- Yes, I'll do it later today.

657
00:50:57,137 --> 00:51:00,538
And get some coke.
It might liven the convent up.

658
00:51:01,304 --> 00:51:04,796
Yolanda, don't think you're so important.

659
00:51:04,903 --> 00:51:06,734
You're just one of my tools.

660
00:51:06,837 --> 00:51:11,672
Sometimes you seem to realize that,
and I hate you for it.

661
00:51:12,504 --> 00:51:14,938
- What are you doing there?
- Looking at you.

662
00:51:15,037 --> 00:51:17,733
Don't! It annoys me!

663
00:51:17,837 --> 00:51:19,737
I glad you didn't go with the others.

664
00:51:20,870 --> 00:51:22,838
We can be alone.

665
00:51:22,937 --> 00:51:24,165
I'm always alone.

666
00:51:24,270 --> 00:51:27,137
Don't say that. You've got me.

667
00:51:28,137 --> 00:51:29,604
- You?
- Yes.

668
00:51:30,770 --> 00:51:32,465
You're in a bad mood.

669
00:51:33,037 --> 00:51:37,098
You can't fool me.
I know your game very well.

670
00:51:37,237 --> 00:51:40,695
- I don't know what you mean.
- Yes, you do.

671
00:51:41,504 --> 00:51:44,803
You mean because
I know why you're here?

672
00:51:45,937 --> 00:51:48,462
I know why you're running away.

673
00:51:49,970 --> 00:51:52,370
- What?
- They say you killed him.

674
00:51:52,471 --> 00:51:54,234
- Who says that?
- Does it matter?

675
00:51:54,337 --> 00:51:58,104
- It's a lie. It wasn't my fault.
- I know.

676
00:51:58,204 --> 00:52:00,570
- Will you call the cops?
- I don't like them.

677
00:52:01,537 --> 00:52:03,835
Go ahead. I don't care.

678
00:52:04,471 --> 00:52:06,336
You think you're brave.

679
00:52:07,170 --> 00:52:10,537
But you're just a poor,
scared, drug addict.

680
00:52:10,837 --> 00:52:13,900
- And you?
- Me?

681
00:52:13,901 --> 00:52:16,627
I'm not scared.

682
00:52:18,870 --> 00:52:20,838
I brought you a gift.

683
00:52:20,937 --> 00:52:23,735
I thought you'd like
something new to wear.

684
00:52:24,903 --> 00:52:28,168
I'll be in the chapel
if you should need me.

685
00:52:28,337 --> 00:52:30,464
Look, I don't need you!

686
00:52:31,337 --> 00:52:35,967
You're nothing
but an instrument that I'm using.

687
00:52:36,404 --> 00:52:37,564
I know.

688
00:52:39,371 --> 00:52:42,033
That's why I hate you at times.

689
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:56,833
"Lord, I am calling you."

690
00:52:56,937 --> 00:53:00,896
"Hurry to me, Lord.
Listen to my voice calling you."

691
00:53:01,770 --> 00:53:04,796
"Let my prayer rise
like incense to you."

692
00:53:05,371 --> 00:53:08,465
"I give you my hands
in humble sacrifice."

693
00:53:09,437 --> 00:53:12,304
"Place, O Lord,
a watch on my mouth."

694
00:53:12,404 --> 00:53:14,964
"A sentinel at the door of my lips."

695
00:53:16,070 --> 00:53:21,371
"Do not let my heart incline towards evil
or commit evil deeds."

696
00:53:22,337 --> 00:53:26,273
"Do not let me break bread
with men of evil."

697
00:53:29,204 --> 00:53:30,796
Continue, Sister.

698
00:53:37,204 --> 00:53:39,934
"May the just man beat me."

699
00:53:43,837 --> 00:53:46,772
- So, it's you.
- Hello, Mother.

700
00:53:47,404 --> 00:53:49,167
Why are you here?

701
00:53:49,437 --> 00:53:51,166
I wanted to see you.

702
00:53:51,304 --> 00:53:52,601
Here I am.

703
00:53:53,837 --> 00:53:56,738
Let me stay. I've nowhere to go.

704
00:53:56,837 --> 00:53:58,134
You can't stay.

705
00:53:59,337 --> 00:54:00,827
Please, Mother.

706
00:54:03,903 --> 00:54:07,601
- I promise I won't cause any trouble.
- Stop that.

707
00:54:11,337 --> 00:54:13,498
Don't you like me anymore?

708
00:54:19,837 --> 00:54:22,305
I told you not to come back.

709
00:54:22,404 --> 00:54:27,734
I swear I can't take anymore!
Let me stay here, just for tonight!

710
00:54:28,470 --> 00:54:30,904
Isn't this a refuge for sinners?

711
00:54:32,270 --> 00:54:33,703
I suppose so.

712
00:54:37,870 --> 00:54:42,463
All right. But you must leave tomorrow.
We have enough problems.

713
00:54:48,737 --> 00:54:52,434
It was horrible.

714
00:54:52,536 --> 00:54:54,299
Try to get some rest.

715
00:54:54,403 --> 00:54:57,998
Don't leave me alone.
I'm scared.

716
00:54:58,204 --> 00:55:00,866
What have you done?

717
00:55:01,470 --> 00:55:05,236
Do you have a tranquilizer?
I'm too nervous to sleep.

718
00:55:05,636 --> 00:55:09,333
Lie down. I'll bring you a tablet.

719
00:55:09,436 --> 00:55:12,064
Do you have you something stronger?

720
00:55:12,170 --> 00:55:13,398
I'll see.

721
00:55:16,204 --> 00:55:17,432
Mother...

722
00:55:19,436 --> 00:55:21,370
- I love you.
- No.

723
00:55:21,870 --> 00:55:23,201
You need me.

724
00:55:25,170 --> 00:55:28,697
- Let me explain.
- You did that when you left.

725
00:55:29,703 --> 00:55:31,432
I didn't forget you.

726
00:55:32,770 --> 00:55:34,203
But I forgot you.

727
00:55:35,503 --> 00:55:38,301
Go to sleep.
Don't make any noise.

728
00:56:10,837 --> 00:56:15,001
- We're sorry to wake you.
- What do you want?

729
00:56:15,104 --> 00:56:16,935
We want Mercedes Cora.

730
00:56:17,103 --> 00:56:20,869
- Mercedes Cora? I don't know her.
- We know that she's here.

731
00:56:20,870 --> 00:56:24,101
- Only five servants of God are here.
- Please, Mother.

732
00:56:24,204 --> 00:56:27,105
Have you got a warrant or anything?

733
00:56:27,204 --> 00:56:30,571
We don't need one.
We'll look for her ourselves.

734
00:56:30,703 --> 00:56:34,662
This place is a labyrinth.
You could get lost.

735
00:56:34,803 --> 00:56:37,033
We'll see.

736
00:56:39,937 --> 00:56:43,199
Take it easy!
You'll wake the sisters.

737
00:56:43,270 --> 00:56:45,367
Wait! I'll tell you where she is.

738
00:56:47,537 --> 00:56:50,233
Don't worry.
The convent's falling apart.

739
00:57:25,037 --> 00:57:26,629
Wait!

740
00:57:27,270 --> 00:57:29,360
Can't you see she's barefoot?

741
00:58:01,303 --> 00:58:03,271
What did they want?

742
00:58:03,370 --> 00:58:07,568
One of our girls came back.
They were looking for her.

743
00:58:08,837 --> 00:58:11,931
- What are you doing?
- Breaking with my past.

744
00:58:12,070 --> 00:58:15,733
I want to start again,
without drugs or memories.

745
00:58:16,870 --> 00:58:19,998
Neither of them is easy to avoid.

746
00:58:20,236 --> 00:58:24,070
But we're harming ourselves
like this, Mother.

747
00:58:24,169 --> 00:58:28,162
I'm strong.
Heroin goes well with my nature.

748
00:58:29,169 --> 00:58:31,569
But not with mine!

749
00:58:31,970 --> 00:58:36,236
I won't go through the same with you
as I did with Jorge.

750
00:58:36,370 --> 00:58:39,271
- What will you do?
- I could work in the garden.

751
00:58:39,370 --> 00:58:41,600
I'm a specialist in hybrids.

752
00:58:42,036 --> 00:58:43,933
- You?
- Yes.

753
00:58:45,570 --> 00:58:47,470
You're full of surprises.

754
00:58:48,703 --> 00:58:50,102
I don't like to talk about myself.

755
00:58:52,737 --> 00:58:54,227
Do as you wish.

756
00:58:56,169 --> 00:58:58,899
- I won't stop you.
- Thank you.

757
00:58:59,837 --> 00:59:01,998
So you're giving up heroin?

758
00:59:02,103 --> 00:59:06,369
- Yes, and so should you.
- It won't be easy.

759
00:59:06,770 --> 00:59:10,035
Just the first few days.
I don't shoot much.

760
00:59:10,136 --> 00:59:13,299
Offer up your suffering for our sins.

761
00:59:13,403 --> 00:59:15,894
My only sin is to love you too much.

762
00:59:17,403 --> 00:59:19,166
Don't talk like that.

763
00:59:20,103 --> 00:59:23,834
- God helps those who love.
- And those who suffer.

764
00:59:24,937 --> 00:59:29,702
Of all the women I've known,
I understand you the least.

765
00:59:30,670 --> 00:59:32,103
That's why you're hooked.

766
01:00:23,003 --> 01:00:24,197
Mother...

767
01:00:27,236 --> 01:00:29,761
This can't go on.

768
01:00:29,869 --> 01:00:32,429
Here's some food.

769
01:00:33,003 --> 01:00:37,064
Thank you, Sister,
but I'm not hungry.

770
01:00:40,069 --> 01:00:44,335
You can't go on like this.
You're sick.

771
01:00:44,436 --> 01:00:48,429
The only jewels
which can adorn the brides of Jesus

772
01:00:50,503 --> 01:00:53,028
are the thorns

773
01:00:53,136 --> 01:00:55,161
and the cross.

774
01:00:55,303 --> 01:00:57,066
I have sinned!

775
01:00:57,203 --> 01:00:59,194
I must be punished!

776
01:00:59,336 --> 01:01:00,530
Mother...

777
01:01:01,737 --> 01:01:05,002
God is merciful.

778
01:01:05,103 --> 01:01:06,695
God?

779
01:01:07,036 --> 01:01:09,004
Where is He?

780
01:01:10,003 --> 01:01:12,233
God has forsaken me.

781
01:01:12,336 --> 01:01:16,961
I beg Him for forgiveness and shelter,
but He hides.

782
01:01:20,003 --> 01:01:24,466
If our girls could see you!
A woman of your strength!

783
01:01:24,570 --> 01:01:26,037
I'm like them.

784
01:01:28,536 --> 01:01:30,504
I admired them so much...

785
01:01:33,236 --> 01:01:36,569
that I've become one of them.

786
01:01:38,703 --> 01:01:43,436
We're going to give a party
for the Mother Superior.

787
01:01:43,536 --> 01:01:45,902
Maybe you could sing.

788
01:01:46,003 --> 01:01:51,898
We usually sing but she'd be delighted
if you were to sing instead.

789
01:01:52,003 --> 01:01:54,233
Although I'm a singer,
I sing very badly.

790
01:01:54,336 --> 01:01:56,031
- You haven't heard them.
- You too!

791
01:01:56,136 --> 01:01:58,832
- What are you talking about?
- The party.

792
01:01:58,969 --> 01:02:02,837
- Is there one this year?
- Convince her to sing.

793
01:02:02,969 --> 01:02:05,403
Yolanda, sing.

794
01:02:05,670 --> 01:02:11,187
- All right. I'll sing!
- Thank you! Thank you!

795
01:02:18,736 --> 01:02:21,899
Hello, Sister.
You have a letter from Africa.

796
01:02:22,003 --> 01:02:23,197
Thank you.

797
01:02:23,303 --> 01:02:25,601
And how's Mercedes doing?

798
01:02:25,702 --> 01:02:29,001
- She's taken the veil.
- Fuck me!

799
01:02:29,103 --> 01:02:33,295
- Give her my best wishes.
- I will.

800
01:02:36,619 --> 01:02:38,619
One...

801
01:02:38,643 --> 01:02:40,643
Three...

802
01:02:40,667 --> 01:02:42,667
Four...

803
01:02:42,691 --> 01:02:44,668
Mother...

804
01:02:44,669 --> 01:02:48,230
We've decided to give you a party,
like every year.

805
01:02:48,336 --> 01:02:50,429
What an idea.

806
01:02:51,570 --> 01:02:53,868
There's a surprise.

807
01:02:54,436 --> 01:02:56,495
Yolanda will sing.

808
01:02:56,603 --> 01:02:58,434
- Really?
- Yes!

809
01:02:58,536 --> 01:03:01,027
- Did you ask her?
- Yes.

810
01:03:02,669 --> 01:03:05,297
Stop worrying about money.

811
01:03:05,403 --> 01:03:08,201
There's a letter from Africa.

812
01:03:09,603 --> 01:03:12,163
We'll go to the market.

813
01:03:12,303 --> 01:03:15,238
That's it. I can do some tricks.

814
01:03:15,336 --> 01:03:19,568
I'll mortify myself in front of the crowd.

815
01:03:19,669 --> 01:03:23,829
People like that.
We could put on a circus.

816
01:03:23,936 --> 01:03:26,131
A nuns' circus.

817
01:03:26,236 --> 01:03:29,728
You know, with the tiger
and Sister Damned.

818
01:03:29,836 --> 01:03:31,929
Sister Rat is a dead loss.

819
01:03:32,036 --> 01:03:35,437
I could crucify myself in the market.

820
01:03:35,536 --> 01:03:38,972
For people's sins,
and my own too.

821
01:03:39,103 --> 01:03:41,037
It'd really be something!

822
01:03:45,702 --> 01:03:48,830
I can't stay
for the Mother General's funeral.

823
01:03:48,936 --> 01:03:50,961
I must eat. I have to go out.

824
01:03:51,103 --> 01:03:54,661
- Shall I heat it up?
- Don't bother me.

825
01:03:57,136 --> 01:04:00,833
Blessed be God!
What has happened?

826
01:04:03,136 --> 01:04:07,470
Good news, Sister.
We'll have a big party.

827
01:04:07,569 --> 01:04:10,163
We'll show the new Mother General...

828
01:04:11,436 --> 01:04:13,404
that we're not beaten.

829
01:04:16,936 --> 01:04:20,531
You'll have some acid tonight.
Now call Sister Rat.

830
01:04:24,802 --> 01:04:28,829
I've had a reply from Africa.
You can go anytime.

831
01:04:28,936 --> 01:04:31,131
I'll leave after your party.

832
01:04:31,236 --> 01:04:35,935
- Julia, I bear you no grudge.
- And I bear you none.

833
01:04:37,203 --> 01:04:40,400
Forgive me for speaking badly
about your books.

834
01:04:40,502 --> 01:04:43,471
But you were right.
They were awful.

835
01:04:43,569 --> 01:04:46,629
You have good taste
in things like that.

836
01:04:46,736 --> 01:04:50,103
Do you know what
Yolanda's plans are?

837
01:04:50,736 --> 01:04:54,900
I don't know. For the time being,
she seems to be happy here.

838
01:04:55,003 --> 01:04:58,131
Yes, but that will end someday

839
01:04:59,169 --> 01:05:01,137
and she'll leave.

840
01:05:01,236 --> 01:05:03,796
If we could have her at my party...

841
01:05:03,902 --> 01:05:07,633
The new Mother General will be there.
You know how she is.

842
01:05:07,736 --> 01:05:12,105
It would be great if we could show her
at least one girl.

843
01:05:12,203 --> 01:05:15,138
Yolanda will be here.
She's going to sing.

844
01:05:15,236 --> 01:05:18,163
- Really?
- Yes, honestly.

845
01:05:20,502 --> 01:05:23,960
- Are you going out?
- Yes, I have to pay a visit.

846
01:05:24,069 --> 01:05:28,698
- Where to?
- I'm going to blackmail the Marquise.

847
01:05:28,802 --> 01:05:30,394
What a temper you have!

848
01:05:44,103 --> 01:05:45,468
The Marquise?

849
01:05:45,569 --> 01:05:48,800
Yes, yes. Here I am.

850
01:05:48,902 --> 01:05:51,462
Good afternoon, ma'am.

851
01:05:51,569 --> 01:05:56,634
I'm going to an exhibition of oil
paintings. Would you like to come?

852
01:05:56,736 --> 01:06:00,069
No, thank you.
Can you spare a moment?

853
01:06:00,169 --> 01:06:01,966
- Just one.
- Yes.

854
01:06:02,069 --> 01:06:04,162
Let's go in here.

855
01:06:07,836 --> 01:06:09,360
Do sit down.

856
01:06:09,469 --> 01:06:11,469
- Well?
- I'll be brief.

857
01:06:11,469 --> 01:06:13,194
I've come to invite you to my party.

858
01:06:13,203 --> 01:06:17,264
Forgive me, but I won't go this year.
I'd be so bored.

859
01:06:17,369 --> 01:06:19,200
I only went because of my husband.

860
01:06:19,303 --> 01:06:23,399
- Perhaps a contribution.
- No, I'm sorry.

861
01:06:23,502 --> 01:06:26,869
Very well,
then I'll get down to business.

862
01:06:27,003 --> 01:06:28,197
- Business?
- Yes.

863
01:06:29,303 --> 01:06:32,666
- I have something to sell.
- What is it? Perfume?

864
01:06:33,469 --> 01:06:37,500
No. Information about
your daughter's stay in Africa.

865
01:06:38,103 --> 01:06:39,661
Valuable information.

866
01:06:41,302 --> 01:06:44,271
But you'll have to pay for it.

867
01:06:44,369 --> 01:06:46,064
What about my grief?

868
01:06:46,802 --> 01:06:50,260
You have grief,
and you also have money.

869
01:06:50,369 --> 01:06:52,303
I only have this letter.

870
01:06:53,136 --> 01:06:56,731
Get out! My daughter is dead!
What else can you say?

871
01:06:57,435 --> 01:06:58,800
100,000 Pesetas.

872
01:06:59,736 --> 01:07:04,472
Get out! I'll write to the missions.
They can tell me.

873
01:07:04,736 --> 01:07:06,727
If you're fine waiting...

874
01:07:07,902 --> 01:07:10,598
Out! I never want to see you again!

875
01:07:11,502 --> 01:07:12,777
Very well.

876
01:07:13,802 --> 01:07:15,623
God be with you.

877
01:07:20,635 --> 01:07:24,528
Well, well!
What a surprise, Mother!

878
01:07:24,635 --> 01:07:27,234
- Come in.
- How are you?

879
01:07:32,136 --> 01:07:33,330
Sit down.

880
01:07:37,736 --> 01:07:39,601
A great crop.

881
01:07:40,136 --> 01:07:42,866
No, you know I don't like soft drugs.

882
01:07:42,969 --> 01:07:46,666
What brings you here?
You need some stuff?

883
01:07:46,769 --> 01:07:51,638
Yes, but I need to borrow some money
from you too.

884
01:07:52,936 --> 01:07:54,563
How much?

885
01:07:54,936 --> 01:07:56,494
100,000 Pesetas.

886
01:07:57,302 --> 01:08:00,032
You're kidding.
I haven't got that money.

887
01:08:00,136 --> 01:08:02,229
You can get it.

888
01:08:02,369 --> 01:08:04,860
How would you pay it back?

889
01:08:05,369 --> 01:08:07,166
I'll sell something.

890
01:08:07,268 --> 01:08:10,362
The confessionals, for instance.

891
01:08:10,469 --> 01:08:13,632
- Who'd buy a confessional?
- A lot of people would.

892
01:08:15,202 --> 01:08:19,366
I know an easier way,
and you'll make a lot more.

893
01:08:19,469 --> 01:08:21,630
Trafficking, I suppose.

894
01:08:21,736 --> 01:08:24,637
Take a trip to Thailand,
make some purchases.

895
01:08:27,377 --> 01:08:29,377
- What do you think?
- All right.

896
01:08:30,502 --> 01:08:31,502
Here.

897
01:08:32,069 --> 01:08:34,902
Set it up for after my party,
in ten days.

898
01:08:35,003 --> 01:08:39,099
- You won't let me down?
- You know I won't.

899
01:08:39,502 --> 01:08:44,197
- Can I have an advance?
- I guess so, but I have to make a call.

900
01:08:52,302 --> 01:08:54,236
"Do wear it at my party."

901
01:08:59,569 --> 01:09:01,036
See you later.

902
01:09:02,469 --> 01:09:05,529
Good luck! And be careful.

903
01:09:05,635 --> 01:09:09,728
- Got everything?
- Yes, we've got a taxi.

904
01:09:09,836 --> 01:09:13,101
We're going to my sister's.
I'll try to pick you up.

905
01:09:13,202 --> 01:09:15,568
- Don't be long.
- No.

906
01:09:15,669 --> 01:09:18,103
- Won't you come with us?
- No, I won't.

907
01:09:20,003 --> 01:09:23,302
Do you agree that love
is the union of the slobber of two?

908
01:09:23,402 --> 01:09:24,835
That's filthy!

909
01:09:24,936 --> 01:09:27,302
And your favorite authors?

910
01:09:27,402 --> 01:09:32,396
Harold Robbins, Vicki Baum...
But I don't read much.

911
01:09:32,502 --> 01:09:34,868
- But I do.
- Yeah?

912
01:09:34,969 --> 01:09:37,631
The house keeps me very busy.

913
01:09:37,736 --> 01:09:39,795
- Do you like it?
- I love it.

914
01:09:39,902 --> 01:09:42,598
The house is the mirror of the soul.

915
01:09:42,702 --> 01:09:44,727
- See that fountain?
- Yes.

916
01:09:44,836 --> 01:09:47,771
- It cost 100,000 Pesetas.
- Fancy that!

917
01:09:47,836 --> 01:09:50,999
We'll take a picture later.

918
01:09:52,602 --> 01:09:53,762
Who can that be?

919
01:09:53,902 --> 01:09:58,271
Answer the door,
and say that Mom can't see anybody.

920
01:09:58,702 --> 01:10:01,671
As I was saying,
I believe in the home and in...

921
01:10:01,802 --> 01:10:04,327
But when do you write?

922
01:10:04,435 --> 01:10:07,097
Well, I don't know.

923
01:10:07,202 --> 01:10:10,035
When the mood strikes me.

924
01:10:10,135 --> 01:10:11,898
My how your hair has grown!

925
01:10:12,002 --> 01:10:14,596
- Is your Mom in?
- She's busy.

926
01:10:14,702 --> 01:10:18,900
- I'll wait.
- No, she can't see anyone.

927
01:10:19,002 --> 01:10:20,867
Out of the way, dear.

928
01:10:21,702 --> 01:10:25,138
- Hello, I didn't expect you.
- I can see that.

929
01:10:25,268 --> 01:10:27,463
My sister, some friends.

930
01:10:27,602 --> 01:10:29,160
- Hello.
- A pleasure.

931
01:10:29,302 --> 01:10:30,564
This is Yolanda Bell.

932
01:10:30,669 --> 01:10:32,261
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

933
01:10:32,369 --> 01:10:36,465
Do you mind waiting inside?
I won't be very long.

934
01:10:36,569 --> 01:10:40,295
- Darling, go with your aunt.
- No, I want to stay here.

935
01:10:40,402 --> 01:10:43,701
Don't be so silly.
It's your aunt.

936
01:10:43,802 --> 01:10:47,465
You always talk about her.
Now go with them.

937
01:10:51,535 --> 01:10:54,868
The family!
They never leave you alone.

938
01:10:55,235 --> 01:10:58,693
You've got a lot of new things
since I was last here.

939
01:10:58,836 --> 01:11:00,394
Yes, we're doing well.

940
01:11:00,535 --> 01:11:05,361
And my friends are very envious
because my mommy is a writer.

941
01:11:05,469 --> 01:11:09,496
- Your mommy's a writer?
- Yes, she's very famous.

942
01:11:09,602 --> 01:11:12,264
Is she called Concha Torres?

943
01:11:12,369 --> 01:11:17,136
Yes, but that's a fake name.
Her real name is Antonia.

944
01:11:17,235 --> 01:11:20,432
I know that! I'm not stupid.

945
01:11:20,535 --> 01:11:22,093
Let's see.

946
01:11:22,202 --> 01:11:25,228
Look what literature can give you.

947
01:11:26,235 --> 01:11:27,827
Let's see.

948
01:11:27,935 --> 01:11:30,096
Cervantes, Gongora...

949
01:11:31,102 --> 01:11:33,297
Just listen to how Gongora sounds.

950
01:11:36,502 --> 01:11:39,196
And what's here?
The same.

951
01:11:40,302 --> 01:11:43,332
Cervantes again.
Four Othellos.

952
01:11:43,435 --> 01:11:44,902
And four whatever...

953
01:11:45,002 --> 01:11:49,336
If you don't believe it,
I've got Mom's press clippings.

954
01:11:49,435 --> 01:11:52,962
- Where? Let me see them.
- They're here.

955
01:11:57,535 --> 01:11:59,196
Let's see.

956
01:12:00,569 --> 01:12:02,696
"Concha Torres, magnificent."

957
01:12:07,102 --> 01:12:08,831
"A literary genius."

958
01:12:10,335 --> 01:12:14,135
"'A sociological phenomenon.'
Gabriel Garcia Marquez."

959
01:12:14,235 --> 01:12:15,964
Look at that!

960
01:12:16,435 --> 01:12:20,496
Why did you never believe me
when I said the same thing?

961
01:12:20,801 --> 01:12:23,895
I thought you were just being nice.

962
01:12:24,002 --> 01:12:26,971
You're too naive.
You never learn.

963
01:12:27,068 --> 01:12:29,434
- She's in for it!
- That's the way!

964
01:12:30,669 --> 01:12:32,261
Aren't you a nun?

965
01:12:33,102 --> 01:12:34,660
No, I'm a prostitute.

966
01:12:34,768 --> 01:12:37,202
Isn't that illegal?

967
01:12:37,268 --> 01:12:40,032
I told you to wait for me!

968
01:12:40,168 --> 01:12:42,636
Is the interview so important?

969
01:12:42,768 --> 01:12:44,895
It's for a life-insurance policy.

970
01:12:45,002 --> 01:12:49,336
I wasn't going to tell you,
but you're my beneficiary.

971
01:12:49,435 --> 01:12:54,296
Don't forget to tell these gentlemen
that you've stopped writing!

972
01:12:59,569 --> 01:13:03,300
This must have cost a fortune.
Where did you get the money?

973
01:13:03,402 --> 01:13:06,371
God helps the needy.
I didn't think you'd come.

974
01:13:06,435 --> 01:13:08,130
Neither did I.

975
01:13:08,502 --> 01:13:09,664
What do you know?

976
01:13:09,689 --> 01:13:13,665
I know so much
it would take days to tell it all.

977
01:13:13,835 --> 01:13:15,860
I'm just interested in my daughter.

978
01:13:16,002 --> 01:13:18,766
- Go to Africa.
- I've written.

979
01:13:18,868 --> 01:13:22,099
- But mail is slow.
- You know the price.

980
01:13:22,768 --> 01:13:26,204
I'll find out sooner or later.
Don't you realize?

981
01:13:26,302 --> 01:13:28,099
Well...

982
01:13:28,202 --> 01:13:29,635
be patient then.

983
01:13:29,735 --> 01:13:33,227
Aren't you afraid I'll
tell the Mother General?

984
01:13:33,335 --> 01:13:35,030
She doesn't know anything.

985
01:13:35,135 --> 01:13:39,231
They wrote to me,
and I was supposed to tell you.

986
01:13:39,602 --> 01:13:41,263
You are disgusting.

987
01:13:42,002 --> 01:13:45,870
Insult me if that helps.
Words don't scare me.

988
01:13:45,968 --> 01:13:47,435
Now, excuse me.

989
01:13:49,302 --> 01:13:50,633
Outrageous!

990
01:13:57,535 --> 01:13:59,560
Who's in my daughter's cell?

991
01:13:59,668 --> 01:14:01,226
What's going on?

992
01:14:01,335 --> 01:14:04,270
Calm down. It's only Yolanda.

993
01:14:04,369 --> 01:14:05,927
Our latest girl.

994
01:14:09,602 --> 01:14:12,036
- May I come in?
- Yes.

995
01:14:13,335 --> 01:14:14,529
I'm the Marquise.

996
01:14:14,634 --> 01:14:17,626
- You've heard of me?
- Of course.

997
01:14:18,002 --> 01:14:19,936
I'm sorry to bother you.

998
01:14:20,068 --> 01:14:25,633
I saw the light was on
and as this was my daughter's cell...

999
01:14:26,210 --> 01:14:28,210
I don't know...

1000
01:14:28,235 --> 01:14:30,778
Why did she enter the convent?

1001
01:14:30,803 --> 01:14:32,751
Because of a boy.

1002
01:14:32,835 --> 01:14:36,236
My husband forbade them to marry.
The boy killed himself.

1003
01:14:37,268 --> 01:14:40,769
Rather unusual.
Such things don't happen nowadays.

1004
01:14:40,868 --> 01:14:43,894
But my husband was like that.

1005
01:14:44,002 --> 01:14:47,802
He had this room done
just like hers at home.

1006
01:14:48,369 --> 01:14:52,533
He gave money to the convent
so he could control her.

1007
01:14:52,901 --> 01:14:57,304
I'm sorry,
but I don't want to think about it.

1008
01:14:57,469 --> 01:14:59,266
It's all too sad and...

1009
01:15:00,402 --> 01:15:02,666
- I'm a beautician.
- Really?

1010
01:15:02,968 --> 01:15:04,663
Yes. Shall I do your make-up?

1011
01:15:05,335 --> 01:15:09,465
- What did you do before?
- A bit of everything.

1012
01:15:10,268 --> 01:15:11,860
You were lucky.

1013
01:15:11,968 --> 01:15:14,664
I've only been Marquise,
wife and mother.

1014
01:15:15,435 --> 01:15:17,369
They weren't expecting you.

1015
01:15:17,469 --> 01:15:23,734
I know, but the Mother Superior got
a letter from Africa about my daughter.

1016
01:15:23,868 --> 01:15:27,133
She hasn't told me yet.
Do you know anything about it?

1017
01:15:27,268 --> 01:15:30,726
No, but I know she got a letter
from the missionaries.

1018
01:15:31,335 --> 01:15:34,736
- Where can it be?
- In her office, I suppose.

1019
01:15:35,568 --> 01:15:39,026
I'll speak to the
Mother General about it.

1020
01:15:39,135 --> 01:15:43,196
That would be a mess,
with the party and all.

1021
01:15:43,968 --> 01:15:46,528
I know of a better and quicker way.

1022
01:16:30,568 --> 01:16:33,401
- What are you doing?
- I wanted some coke.

1023
01:16:33,568 --> 01:16:36,503
I haven't sung in ages,
and I needed a lift.

1024
01:16:36,634 --> 01:16:39,569
I didn't dare ask you downstairs.

1025
01:16:39,668 --> 01:16:41,363
How did you get in?

1026
01:16:43,335 --> 01:16:47,160
With a hairpin.
Do you mind?

1027
01:16:47,268 --> 01:16:50,095
- Did you find it?
- No, I didn't.

1028
01:16:50,202 --> 01:16:52,568
Right, I have it here.

1029
01:16:56,534 --> 01:16:58,764
The Mother General!

1030
01:16:59,434 --> 01:17:00,833
Let her wait!

1031
01:17:02,235 --> 01:17:05,495
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

1032
01:17:11,102 --> 01:17:12,535
Open up, Mother Superior!

1033
01:17:13,243 --> 01:17:15,243
She is such a pain.

1034
01:17:15,268 --> 01:17:17,168
I know you're in there!

1035
01:17:18,268 --> 01:17:21,259
Come on.
You're gorgeous!

1036
01:17:26,768 --> 01:17:29,669
- What were you doing?
- It's a surprise.

1037
01:17:30,434 --> 01:17:32,925
We have a lot to talk about.

1038
01:17:33,035 --> 01:17:35,401
I've come from Albacete
just for that.

1039
01:17:35,501 --> 01:17:38,197
Later. I have a lot to do now.

1040
01:17:39,135 --> 01:17:41,296
Remember, I'm the hostess.

1041
01:17:41,401 --> 01:17:43,995
Do you like my party?
We spared no expense.

1042
01:17:44,102 --> 01:17:47,868
It's lovely,
but you all seem a bit strange.

1043
01:17:47,968 --> 01:17:49,401
It's most disturbing.

1044
01:17:49,534 --> 01:17:51,502
Today's an exception.

1045
01:17:51,601 --> 01:17:53,865
Don't think we party every day.

1046
01:17:53,968 --> 01:17:56,562
The convent is having difficulties.
We should talk about that.

1047
01:17:56,668 --> 01:17:59,796
Where is the altar, the paintings?

1048
01:17:59,901 --> 01:18:02,062
- They've disappeared.
- What do you mean?

1049
01:18:02,901 --> 01:18:07,133
- Are you enjoying yourself?
- Much more than I expected.

1050
01:18:07,267 --> 01:18:11,533
I'm so glad.
Sister, take some cake to Yolanda.

1051
01:18:11,634 --> 01:18:14,034
Yes, this lot will eat it all.

1052
01:18:15,568 --> 01:18:18,298
What's going on?
They all seem so vague.

1053
01:18:18,401 --> 01:18:22,098
They can't face the fact
that things have to change.

1054
01:18:22,202 --> 01:18:27,894
When the late Mother General was ill,
this convent went haywire.

1055
01:18:28,002 --> 01:18:29,970
Look at this!

1056
01:18:30,068 --> 01:18:32,793
- What will you do?
- Close it.

1057
01:18:33,468 --> 01:18:36,562
The Humble Redeemers are finished.

1058
01:18:36,668 --> 01:18:38,966
- Will you sell it?
- Of course.

1059
01:18:39,068 --> 01:18:43,466
Someone wants to buy it.
But that's not the reason.

1060
01:18:43,568 --> 01:18:47,265
The Mother Superior
has gone way over the limit.

1061
01:18:47,401 --> 01:18:51,928
Those horrible names.
Sister Rat, Sister Manure...

1062
01:18:52,068 --> 01:18:55,231
- It's finished!
- I thought it was amusing.

1063
01:18:55,334 --> 01:18:57,234
I disapprove of humiliation.

1064
01:18:57,334 --> 01:19:00,599
The nearest thing to pride
is an excess of humility.

1065
01:19:03,102 --> 01:19:06,731
- So are you going to Africa?
- I suppose so.

1066
01:19:07,501 --> 01:19:10,766
I want a detailed report
on everything that happens.

1067
01:19:11,334 --> 01:19:14,394
I've heard things which disturb me.

1068
01:19:14,501 --> 01:19:19,415
Three women alone in the jungle,
with one chaplain

1069
01:19:19,768 --> 01:19:22,259
and surrounded by savages.

1070
01:19:22,401 --> 01:19:24,164
The flesh is weak.

1071
01:19:24,267 --> 01:19:27,634
Reverend Mother,
I've never been a spy.

1072
01:19:27,735 --> 01:19:30,767
- I'm not starting now.
- How dare you!

1073
01:19:30,868 --> 01:19:32,733
I'm in no mood to talk.

1074
01:19:35,968 --> 01:19:39,768
- I brought you some cake.
- I'm not hungry.

1075
01:19:39,868 --> 01:19:41,563
You're not dressed!

1076
01:19:43,168 --> 01:19:45,192
Listen, do me a favor.

1077
01:19:45,601 --> 01:19:50,768
Give this letter to the Marquise,
but make sure that no one sees you.

1078
01:19:50,901 --> 01:19:52,493
Can I read it?

1079
01:19:52,634 --> 01:19:54,864
I'll explain later.

1080
01:19:56,401 --> 01:19:58,369
- Hurry up!
- Get dressed.

1081
01:20:03,868 --> 01:20:08,463
- Don't open it here.
- But I'm dying to read it.

1082
01:20:08,568 --> 01:20:11,865
- Go into the toilet.
- Good idea!

1083
01:20:12,468 --> 01:20:15,562
Could you tell me
where the toilets are?

1084
01:20:15,668 --> 01:20:18,796
Use the one in my cell.
It's cleaner.

1085
01:20:18,901 --> 01:20:21,893
Don't let anyone out.
We're about to start.

1086
01:20:22,968 --> 01:20:26,995
- Where's the Marquise?
- She's gone for a piss.

1087
01:20:27,134 --> 01:20:31,232
Get everyone seated.
Yolanda will be down soon.

1088
01:20:32,002 --> 01:20:34,026
Come in, ma'am.

1089
01:20:34,134 --> 01:20:36,064
- I won't fall?
- No, no.

1090
01:20:36,088 --> 01:20:37,500
Thank you.

1091
01:20:37,501 --> 01:20:39,935
- Isn't this lovely!
- My animals...

1092
01:20:40,368 --> 01:20:44,262
I keep them in here.
They were a temptation for the others.

1093
01:20:44,368 --> 01:20:46,962
- There you have the toilet.
- Thank you.

1094
01:20:47,067 --> 01:20:51,167
- I must sit down, I'm so tired.
- It's nice and soft.

1095
01:20:51,368 --> 01:20:54,997
- These high heels are really killing me.
- As you wish.

1096
01:20:55,101 --> 01:20:58,468
You lot aren't to bother the Marquise.

1097
01:20:58,601 --> 01:21:00,398
- She wants to rest for a while.
- Thank you.

1098
01:21:00,534 --> 01:21:04,265
I'll just lie down.
Will you close the door?

1099
01:21:17,801 --> 01:21:19,928
<i>This boy is Virginia's son.</i>

1100
01:21:20,034 --> 01:21:24,061
<i>We found a trunk of hers in his hut.</i>

1101
01:21:24,167 --> 01:21:26,761
<i>The Marquise's locket was inside.</i>

1102
01:21:26,868 --> 01:21:30,463
<i>The child's father
was the hunter she ran away with.</i>

1103
01:21:30,601 --> 01:21:35,004
<i>When the cannibals ate her,
the boy was still a baby.</i>

1104
01:21:35,101 --> 01:21:38,901
<i>The monkeys cared for him.
He grew up like one of them.</i>

1105
01:21:39,001 --> 01:21:43,301
<i>Give the photo and locket to the Marquise.</i>

1106
01:21:48,201 --> 01:21:52,964
All kinds of women
have passed through our convent,

1107
01:21:53,067 --> 01:21:55,365
but never a singer.

1108
01:21:55,468 --> 01:22:01,797
But a few weeks ago,
Providence sent us the gift of a singer.

1109
01:22:03,368 --> 01:22:06,235
In the name of all the women

1110
01:22:06,368 --> 01:22:09,132
who have found refuge,

1111
01:22:09,234 --> 01:22:13,623
consolation and fun
within these walls,

1112
01:22:14,934 --> 01:22:18,370
Yolanda Bell, accompanied by us,

1113
01:22:18,468 --> 01:22:21,904
is going to delight us
with a lovely song,

1114
01:22:22,001 --> 01:22:24,595
in homage to that woman

1115
01:22:26,234 --> 01:22:31,160
who has given herself,
body and soul to our redeeming work.

1116
01:22:31,568 --> 01:22:35,664
For her,
our beloved Mother Superior

1117
01:22:35,768 --> 01:22:38,601
and for Yolanda Bell,
a big hand!

1118
01:23:04,900 --> 01:23:08,996
<i>Once again, without speaking</i>

1119
01:23:09,101 --> 01:23:12,264
<i>I walk that same old path.</i>

1120
01:23:13,534 --> 01:23:17,265
<i>Wherever my feet take me.</i>

1121
01:23:18,167 --> 01:23:21,762
<i>I wonder if I will ever find you again.</i>

1122
01:23:22,735 --> 01:23:25,826
<i>And once again,
my dreams will be filled</i>

1123
01:23:26,750 --> 01:23:29,850
<i>with my illusions.</i>

1124
01:23:31,568 --> 01:23:34,799
<i>I'll love as much as I can love</i>

1125
01:23:34,900 --> 01:23:39,462
<i>and I'll forget as
much as I should forget.</i>

1126
01:23:40,301 --> 01:23:43,795
<i>For you I won't even have</i>

1127
01:23:44,468 --> 01:23:48,063
<i>one miserable look.</i>

1128
01:23:49,134 --> 01:23:52,399
<i>It was better to bury in the past</i>

1129
01:23:52,501 --> 01:23:57,063
<i>your forbidden love,
which should never have been.</i>

1130
01:23:57,934 --> 01:24:01,267
<i>Once again,
I walk the same old path.</i>

1131
01:24:02,434 --> 01:24:06,063
<i>Once again,
with a smile upon my face.</i>

1132
01:24:06,867 --> 01:24:10,598
<i>If I came to your love,
it was just because I did.</i>

1133
01:24:11,334 --> 01:24:15,065
<i>And if I left your love,
it was just because I did.</i>

1134
01:24:16,034 --> 01:24:19,401
<i>Again, I walk the same old path.</i>

1135
01:24:20,368 --> 01:24:23,895
<i>Again, with a smile upon my face.</i>

1136
01:24:25,001 --> 01:24:28,562
<i>If I came to your love,
it was just because I did.</i>

1137
01:24:29,201 --> 01:24:32,602
<i>And if I left your love,
it was just because I did.</i>

1138
01:25:05,900 --> 01:25:09,927
<i>I came here because I came,
and I left because I left.</i>

1139
01:25:10,034 --> 01:25:14,625
<i>I love all that I can,
and keep walking that old path.</i>

1140
01:25:14,734 --> 01:25:18,670
<i>I keep walking on that path,
walking where I want to go.</i>

1141
01:25:18,767 --> 01:25:23,092
<i>Nothing you say, Mother,
can make me change.</i>

1142
01:25:23,116 --> 01:25:27,016
<i>I came here because I came,
and I left because I left.</i>

1143
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:31,040
<i>I love all that I can,
and keep walking that old path.</i>

1144
01:25:31,368 --> 01:25:36,032
<i>Now everything is different.
Things aren't what they were.</i>

1145
01:25:36,134 --> 01:25:40,264
<i>I'm alone, I'm very happy,
and my life is all my own.</i>

1146
01:25:40,288 --> 01:25:43,988
<i>I came here because I came,
and I left because I left.</i>

1147
01:25:44,012 --> 01:25:48,212
<i>I love all that I can,
and keep walking that old path.</i>

1148
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:53,193
<i>But life is a comedy.
This is the university.</i>

1149
01:25:53,301 --> 01:25:57,364
<i>If you don't know where you are
you aren't going anywhere.</i>

1150
01:25:57,388 --> 01:26:01,388
<i>I came here because I came,
and I left because I left.</i>

1151
01:26:01,412 --> 01:26:05,512
<i>I love all that I can,
and keep walking that old path.</i>

1152
01:26:14,636 --> 01:26:18,736
<i>I came here because I came,
and I left because I left.</i>

1153
01:26:18,760 --> 01:26:22,960
<i>I love all that I can,
and keep walking that old path.</i>

1154
01:26:31,884 --> 01:26:35,984
<i>I came here because I came,
and I left because I left.</i>

1155
01:26:36,008 --> 01:26:40,208
<i>I love all that I can,
and keep walking that old path.</i>

1156
01:26:49,032 --> 01:26:53,332
<i>I came here because I came,
and I left because I left.</i>

1157
01:26:53,356 --> 01:26:57,356
<i>I love all that I can,
and keep walking that old path.</i>

1158
01:27:14,867 --> 01:27:18,064
You didn't wear the dress I gave you.

1159
01:27:18,167 --> 01:27:20,465
I thought you liked it.

1160
01:27:20,567 --> 01:27:23,798
I did like it.
But I liked Sister Snake's too.

1161
01:27:23,900 --> 01:27:26,425
It doesn't matter.

1162
01:27:26,567 --> 01:27:29,559
Thank you for singing at my party.

1163
01:27:31,334 --> 01:27:33,234
You were...

1164
01:27:33,334 --> 01:27:35,199
so obscene!

1165
01:27:36,433 --> 01:27:39,869
I'm glad you liked it.
I sang it for you.

1166
01:27:41,667 --> 01:27:43,191
Wait...

1167
01:27:43,334 --> 01:27:44,892
Let me help you.

1168
01:27:47,167 --> 01:27:48,600
What is this?

1169
01:27:53,334 --> 01:27:57,395
God forgive me
if I feel like another Veronica.

1170
01:27:58,001 --> 01:28:02,562
You're out of it.
Go away, I want to change.

1171
01:28:02,667 --> 01:28:05,898
Of course. I'll see you later.

1172
01:28:13,533 --> 01:28:16,969
Where's the Mother Superior?
I must see her.

1173
01:28:17,800 --> 01:28:21,201
I'll look for her.
She must be praying.

1174
01:28:21,867 --> 01:28:23,664
Sister Damned!

1175
01:28:23,767 --> 01:28:26,231
- Forgive me.
- I haven't finished.

1176
01:28:28,101 --> 01:28:31,730
Gather up all your personal belongings.

1177
01:28:31,834 --> 01:28:34,530
I'll look after what little is left.

1178
01:28:34,633 --> 01:28:36,760
May I tidy up?

1179
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:40,392
It's such a mess.

1180
01:28:42,667 --> 01:28:44,635
Poor girls!

1181
01:28:48,067 --> 01:28:50,194
Father...

1182
01:28:50,300 --> 01:28:52,598
I'd like to confess.

1183
01:28:52,700 --> 01:28:55,260
- Now?
- Yes.

1184
01:28:59,134 --> 01:29:01,830
Where are you going?

1185
01:29:01,934 --> 01:29:03,458
I'm going to confess.

1186
01:29:03,567 --> 01:29:06,502
There are confessors in Albacete.

1187
01:29:06,600 --> 01:29:08,830
- Can't you wait?
- No.

1188
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:17,898
Where's Yolanda? I must see her.

1189
01:29:18,001 --> 01:29:21,960
She won't be long.
Do you mind if we take a walk?

1190
01:29:22,101 --> 01:29:25,460
- What's wrong?
- The thing is, I'm a writer.

1191
01:29:25,567 --> 01:29:29,594
- I used to have a pen name.
- What were you called?

1192
01:29:29,700 --> 01:29:34,521
- Concha Torres. You wouldn't...
- But I've read all your novels!

1193
01:29:34,546 --> 01:29:36,152
- I'm a fan of yours!
- Really?

1194
01:29:36,233 --> 01:29:40,294
I can't believe it!
Concha Torres is a nun!

1195
01:29:42,134 --> 01:29:44,125
Yolanda, I owe you so much.

1196
01:29:44,233 --> 01:29:46,394
I can never thank you enough.

1197
01:29:47,500 --> 01:29:49,365
The letter, that song...

1198
01:29:49,500 --> 01:29:53,834
- You sing so well.
- I don't know about that.

1199
01:29:53,934 --> 01:29:56,729
Ratty... I'm leaving.

1200
01:29:56,834 --> 01:30:01,293
- Why? What's happened?
- Nothing. I just want to leave.

1201
01:30:01,400 --> 01:30:04,460
- What about Africa?
- What would I do there?

1202
01:30:04,600 --> 01:30:06,363
So where will you go?

1203
01:30:07,234 --> 01:30:08,865
I don't know.

1204
01:30:09,266 --> 01:30:13,965
Come to my house. I'm alone,
and I owe you both so much.

1205
01:30:14,067 --> 01:30:15,534
- Really?
- Really.

1206
01:30:15,633 --> 01:30:17,726
- For a few days?
- Forever.

1207
01:30:17,834 --> 01:30:21,167
- Great! What about you?
- I don't know.

1208
01:30:21,300 --> 01:30:23,666
Didn't you want to change your life?

1209
01:30:23,767 --> 01:30:26,668
I don't know. It's just that...

1210
01:30:26,767 --> 01:30:29,235
Well, I'm leaving.

1211
01:30:29,367 --> 01:30:32,666
We'll go when you want.
We can go right now.

1212
01:30:32,767 --> 01:30:36,823
- I'll walk you to the door and decide.
- Do come.

1213
01:30:38,266 --> 01:30:40,063
We must speak, Mother.

1214
01:30:41,067 --> 01:30:44,925
- You won't slip away.
- I didn't try to.

1215
01:30:46,367 --> 01:30:49,200
But I didn't want you
to spoil my party.

1216
01:30:50,667 --> 01:30:54,899
Well, in the future,
there will be no more parties.

1217
01:30:55,001 --> 01:30:56,525
All this is over!

1218
01:30:57,400 --> 01:30:59,265
I've spoken to the others.

1219
01:31:01,266 --> 01:31:04,793
I know what you'll say,
and my answer is no.

1220
01:31:04,900 --> 01:31:09,460
Yes, times are hard
but that doesn't scare me.

1221
01:31:09,567 --> 01:31:12,468
I'm your superior.
You must obey me.

1222
01:31:12,567 --> 01:31:15,764
They can go if they want.
I've written to the Pope.

1223
01:31:15,900 --> 01:31:19,694
I'm going to found my own order.
I can find funds and followers.

1224
01:31:19,800 --> 01:31:22,394
Tomorrow I leave on a business trip.

1225
01:31:22,500 --> 01:31:25,435
- What business?
- I'm not telling you.

1226
01:31:25,533 --> 01:31:27,501
I'll give you three days.

1227
01:31:28,734 --> 01:31:31,032
I will come to get you.

1228
01:31:32,001 --> 01:31:33,764
I've nothing more to say.

1229
01:31:35,001 --> 01:31:36,195
Let's go!

1230
01:31:49,400 --> 01:31:52,233
Thank you for everything.

1231
01:31:52,333 --> 01:31:54,324
I'll never forget tonight.

1232
01:31:56,834 --> 01:31:58,961
Let's go to bed.

1233
01:31:59,066 --> 01:32:01,660
It's been a very busy day.

1234
01:32:01,767 --> 01:32:05,533
We'll discuss things tomorrow.
Have you seen Yolanda?

1235
01:32:05,633 --> 01:32:07,726
She went to her room.

1236
01:32:07,867 --> 01:32:12,201
- Sister Rat? Sister Snake?
- Sister Rat is with the Marquise.

1237
01:32:12,300 --> 01:32:15,030
Sister Snake is confessing.

1238
01:32:16,166 --> 01:32:17,166
Come.

1239
01:32:20,500 --> 01:32:22,365
Leave that.

1240
01:32:22,467 --> 01:32:25,265
- Leave it.
- It's such a mess.

1241
01:32:25,367 --> 01:32:27,358
You're impossible!

1242
01:32:44,166 --> 01:32:46,532
I got used to sewing with you...

1243
01:32:47,800 --> 01:32:50,268
to taking communion with you...

1244
01:32:50,367 --> 01:32:52,767
to worrying about you.

1245
01:32:53,166 --> 01:32:55,760
I hate the thought of being separated.

1246
01:32:56,867 --> 01:32:58,494
That isn't a sin.

1247
01:32:59,433 --> 01:33:02,628
God is love.
He made us to love.

1248
01:33:06,100 --> 01:33:07,658
I love you too.

1249
01:33:08,500 --> 01:33:11,560
I learned to sew
to spend more time with you.

1250
01:33:12,933 --> 01:33:16,458
- To be closer to you.
- But it's impossible!

1251
01:33:16,567 --> 01:33:20,230
I'm a nun and you're a priest.

1252
01:33:21,333 --> 01:33:22,732
We made our vows.

1253
01:33:22,834 --> 01:33:26,429
- Why are you afraid?
- I don't know, Father.

1254
01:33:28,899 --> 01:33:31,599
Sister Damned, what are you doing with
the tiger in church?

1255
01:33:31,899 --> 01:33:33,730
I'm going to Albacete.

1256
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:37,233
Will you take care of him?

1257
01:33:37,333 --> 01:33:38,994
I'll miss him so much but...

1258
01:33:39,100 --> 01:33:43,093
I can't take him with me.

1259
01:33:43,667 --> 01:33:46,659
He knows you two.

1260
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:51,768
You're going to be a family.
He'll have a home.

1261
01:33:52,033 --> 01:33:54,593
Everyone knew but me.

1262
01:33:56,633 --> 01:33:58,567
Even you, Boy.

1263
01:33:59,767 --> 01:34:01,564
Our love is like you.

1264
01:34:01,667 --> 01:34:05,694
A tiger that grew unnoticed
within these walls.

1265
01:34:05,800 --> 01:34:09,634
We'll love you like a son,
and you'll never go hungry.

1266
01:34:09,734 --> 01:34:12,960
- I promise.
- Well, I'm going.

1267
01:34:13,734 --> 01:34:17,261
And you'd better behave yourself.

1268
01:34:20,933 --> 01:34:22,366
God bless you.

1269
01:34:50,400 --> 01:34:52,459
Yolanda, it's me. Let me in.

1270
01:34:58,899 --> 01:35:04,233
I'm going to Thailand tomorrow.
I want to say good-bye.

1271
01:35:04,333 --> 01:35:06,392
We have lots to talk about.

1272
01:35:11,200 --> 01:35:12,997
Let me in!

1272
01:35:13,305 --> 01:36:13,263
