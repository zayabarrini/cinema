00:01:03,319 --> 00:01:05,981
BROKEN EMBRACES

2
00:01:43,459 --> 00:01:44,653
What's your name?

3
00:01:45,928 --> 00:01:47,225
Harry Caine.

4
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:51,128
<i>I used to be called Mateo
and I was a film director.</i>

5
00:01:52,768 --> 00:01:54,497
<i>I was always tempted by the idea</i>

6
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:57,334
<i>of being someone else,
as well as myself.</i>

7
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:00,308
<i>Living one life wasn't enough,</i>

8
00:02:00,943 --> 00:02:02,672
<i>so I invented a pseudonym,</i>

9
00:02:03,179 --> 00:02:04,578
<i>Harry Caine,</i>

10
00:02:05,447 --> 00:02:09,144
<i>an adventurer who, as fate would
have it, became a writer.</i>

11
00:02:10,653 --> 00:02:14,054
<i>I had him sign all the
scripts and stories I wrote.</i>

12
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:16,079
<i>For years,</i>

13
00:02:16,559 --> 00:02:20,359
<i>Mateo Blanco and Harry Caine
shared the same body,</i>

14
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:22,224
<i>mine.</i>

15
00:02:23,232 --> 00:02:24,790
<i>But a moment came</i>

16
00:02:25,167 --> 00:02:28,102
<i>when suddenly I could
only be Harry Caine.</i>

17
00:02:29,605 --> 00:02:31,573
<i>I became my pseudonym.</i>

18
00:02:32,374 --> 00:02:35,002
<i>A self-made writer
made by himself.</i>

19
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:39,211
<i>There was just one
unforeseen detail.</i>

20
00:02:40,149 --> 00:02:42,640
<i>Harry Caine would
be a blind writer.</i>

21
00:02:45,554 --> 00:02:47,146
Ernesto Martel's dead!

22
00:02:48,157 --> 00:02:49,146
Who?

23
00:02:49,792 --> 00:02:50,918
Ernesto Martel.

24
00:02:50,993 --> 00:02:53,052
I know his granddaughter.

25
00:02:53,762 --> 00:02:54,922
So he's dead.

26
00:02:55,331 --> 00:02:57,128
Yes. Did you know him?

27
00:02:57,299 --> 00:02:58,459
No.

28
00:03:01,103 --> 00:03:02,764
What are you interested in?

29
00:03:03,339 --> 00:03:04,601
Politics,

30
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:07,099
finance, culture...

31
00:03:07,176 --> 00:03:08,541
I'm interested in you.

32
00:03:09,578 --> 00:03:10,806
What are you like?

33
00:03:11,914 --> 00:03:13,711
Do you mind describing yourself?

34
00:03:18,187 --> 00:03:19,449
What do you want to know?

35
00:03:20,856 --> 00:03:22,847
Your measurements, for example.

36
00:03:24,093 --> 00:03:26,618
36", 26", 36".

37
00:03:28,297 --> 00:03:29,730
What color are your eyes?

38
00:03:31,066 --> 00:03:32,226
Green,

39
00:03:32,835 --> 00:03:34,860
and in summer kind of bluish.

40
00:03:36,005 --> 00:03:37,131
And your hair?

41
00:03:37,873 --> 00:03:39,363
And how are you dressed?

42
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:43,169
I'm blonde,

43
00:03:43,979 --> 00:03:46,277
with long, straight hair.

44
00:03:47,516 --> 00:03:48,505
I'm wearing

45
00:03:48,884 --> 00:03:51,546
a purple tank top,

46
00:03:51,887 --> 00:03:53,445
tight jeans...

47
00:03:54,823 --> 00:03:56,256
Tight?

48
00:03:57,393 --> 00:03:59,384
Yes, tight.

49
00:04:00,029 --> 00:04:01,018
And high heels.

50
00:04:01,096 --> 00:04:02,154
How high?

51
00:04:02,932 --> 00:04:04,229
Very high.

52
00:04:07,569 --> 00:04:08,729
Let's see.

53
00:04:11,874 --> 00:04:13,341
Blonde hair,

54
00:04:14,576 --> 00:04:15,736
long.

55
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,076
Let's see, your eyes.

56
00:04:20,182 --> 00:04:21,877
Green eyes,

57
00:04:21,951 --> 00:04:23,816
in summer kind of blue.

58
00:04:24,486 --> 00:04:25,885
And your skin...

59
00:04:27,423 --> 00:04:28,788
What beautiful skin!

60
00:04:30,326 --> 00:04:31,793
And your lips

61
00:04:35,531 --> 00:04:37,158
are full.

62
00:05:29,418 --> 00:05:30,908
May I use the bathroom?

63
00:05:30,986 --> 00:05:32,146
Of course.

64
00:05:32,888 --> 00:05:34,480
At the end of the hall.

65
00:05:50,906 --> 00:05:52,874
Sorry, I thought you were alone.

66
00:05:53,842 --> 00:05:57,835
- May I come in, or is there an encore?
- No, come in. We've finished.

67
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:04,981
She helped me cross the road, and
I asked her to read me the paper.

68
00:06:05,154 --> 00:06:06,178
Yeah.

69
00:06:06,889 --> 00:06:09,187
The place is in a mess.

70
00:06:12,861 --> 00:06:14,954
- What are you looking for?
- My shirt.

71
00:06:16,398 --> 00:06:17,387
Here.

72
00:06:17,566 --> 00:06:18,794
Your shirt.

73
00:06:19,301 --> 00:06:21,030
- Thanks.
- Anything else?

74
00:06:21,203 --> 00:06:22,534
Your socks?

75
00:06:22,704 --> 00:06:24,069
Yes, thanks.

76
00:06:25,707 --> 00:06:26,799
Here.

77
00:06:27,242 --> 00:06:28,334
Thanks.

78
00:06:36,251 --> 00:06:37,240
Hello.

79
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:39,780
Hello.

80
00:06:43,492 --> 00:06:45,926
Well, Harry, I'll be off.

81
00:06:47,463 --> 00:06:49,931
- Thanks for helping me cross.
- You're welcome.

82
00:06:50,099 --> 00:06:52,431
- You're standing on my foot.
- I'm sorry!

83
00:06:53,068 --> 00:06:54,092
Sorry.

84
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:57,165
- It was a pleasure.
- Likewise.

85
00:06:58,107 --> 00:06:59,802
- Thank you.
- Not at all.

86
00:07:01,243 --> 00:07:03,302
Well, I have to go.

87
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:05,071
I hope we meet again.

88
00:07:05,714 --> 00:07:06,738
Yes.

89
00:07:14,857 --> 00:07:19,089
You can't come home with the first
person to help you cross the road!

90
00:07:19,261 --> 00:07:20,888
Something'll happen to you.

91
00:07:21,063 --> 00:07:23,293
Everything's already
happened to me.

92
00:07:23,866 --> 00:07:26,198
All that's left
is to enjoy life.

93
00:07:29,805 --> 00:07:32,740
Diego told me you finished
the script yesterday.

94
00:07:33,976 --> 00:07:36,274
I'd like to add a
final epilogue.

95
00:07:36,445 --> 00:07:40,040
I was to give it to the producer
and the director today.

96
00:07:40,682 --> 00:07:42,616
You'll have it tomorrow.

97
00:07:44,653 --> 00:07:46,280
Ernesto Martel's dead.

98
00:07:51,527 --> 00:07:52,858
He was very ill.

99
00:07:53,962 --> 00:07:56,192
We haven't talked
about him in years.

100
00:07:59,401 --> 00:08:00,663
That's true.

101
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:04,828
Hello.

102
00:08:05,774 --> 00:08:07,071
You look awful.

103
00:08:07,242 --> 00:08:08,334
I ran here.

104
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:10,102
This is Monday.

105
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:14,310
Don't run for my sake, Diego.
We aren't in a hurry.

106
00:08:14,483 --> 00:08:16,644
I am. I gave my word.

107
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,683
You'll have it tonight.

108
00:08:19,855 --> 00:08:21,846
We're changing the ending.

109
00:08:22,024 --> 00:08:23,150
- Now?
- Yes.

110
00:08:25,827 --> 00:08:27,351
Think about the next script.

111
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:30,965
Something with fantasy
or terror for brats.

112
00:08:31,533 --> 00:08:33,091
It's what sells best.

113
00:08:33,268 --> 00:08:34,963
I don't know if I can.

114
00:08:37,005 --> 00:08:38,495
I'd thought about

115
00:08:39,007 --> 00:08:41,908
working on a story based
on Arthur Miller's son.

116
00:08:43,412 --> 00:08:45,880
- The writer who married Marilyn?
- Yes.

117
00:08:45,948 --> 00:08:49,281
It appeared in <i>Vanity Fair</i>,
and I read it in <i>El Pais.</i>

118
00:08:49,585 --> 00:08:53,419
After Marilyn, he married the
photographer Inge Morath,

119
00:08:53,589 --> 00:08:54,851
and they had a son.

120
00:08:55,357 --> 00:08:58,793
He was born with Down's syndrome,
and Miller hid him away.

121
00:08:59,928 --> 00:09:02,522
He doesn't even mention
him in his memoirs,

122
00:09:02,598 --> 00:09:04,532
and he never wanted to see him.

123
00:09:05,033 --> 00:09:08,002
Despite his wife's pleas,
he would never see him.

124
00:09:10,038 --> 00:09:11,369
That's awful!

125
00:09:12,341 --> 00:09:14,468
But one day they met by chance.

126
00:09:15,377 --> 00:09:18,904
Miller was giving a lecture
in defense of a mental retard

127
00:09:19,648 --> 00:09:23,516
who'd been sentenced to death
after making a forced confession.

128
00:09:24,186 --> 00:09:27,178
His son with Down's syndrome
was in the audience.

129
00:09:27,356 --> 00:09:31,816
After the lecture, the son went up
to the stage and hugged his father.

130
00:09:32,661 --> 00:09:35,494
Miller didn't know how
to get free of that man,

131
00:09:36,231 --> 00:09:39,598
but then the stranger
let go of him and said,

132
00:09:40,669 --> 00:09:44,469
"I'm your son Daniel, and I'm
very proud of you, Dad."

133
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:53,074
We'd have to ask the
family for the rights.

134
00:09:53,649 --> 00:09:55,139
We'll change the names.

135
00:09:55,217 --> 00:09:57,185
It isn't about the
writer's shabbiness,

136
00:09:57,452 --> 00:09:59,613
it's about the strength
of the son who survives

137
00:09:59,688 --> 00:10:02,452
without any grudge against the
father who'd ignored him.

138
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:05,620
It's very interesting,

139
00:10:06,895 --> 00:10:10,092
but years ago, when you
started writing again

140
00:10:10,165 --> 00:10:11,894
and I sold your scripts,

141
00:10:12,034 --> 00:10:16,471
you said you'd never do
remakes, sequels or biopics.

142
00:10:16,638 --> 00:10:19,573
I remember clearly because I
was surprised by the biopics.

143
00:10:19,741 --> 00:10:22,539
This wouldn't be a biopic,
it's about overcoming the odds

144
00:10:22,711 --> 00:10:25,544
- and about natural goodness.
- Yeah. I'll get the door.

145
00:10:29,885 --> 00:10:32,547
I brought yogurts, but
he's out of cleaning stuff

146
00:10:32,721 --> 00:10:34,382
and juice, too.

147
00:10:34,556 --> 00:10:36,581
And pick up the dry cleaning.

148
00:10:38,694 --> 00:10:41,629
- I'm off, guys.
- Okay, fine.

149
00:10:41,797 --> 00:10:43,321
We'll talk about that later.

150
00:10:43,398 --> 00:10:44,865
Okay, Judit.

151
00:11:06,121 --> 00:11:07,918
- How are you?
- Fine, and you?

152
00:11:08,023 --> 00:11:10,287
Fine. Got that session?

153
00:11:10,359 --> 00:11:12,759
Freshly downloaded.

154
00:11:13,829 --> 00:11:14,853
Great.

155
00:11:16,765 --> 00:11:17,891
Hey,

156
00:11:18,266 --> 00:11:19,961
you want a bit of crystal?

157
00:11:20,902 --> 00:11:23,530
Nah, I need to sleep
occasionally.

158
00:11:24,272 --> 00:11:25,432
Hide me.

159
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:27,838
Be more discreet.

160
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:30,375
There's hardly anyone.

161
00:11:35,984 --> 00:11:37,008
Hey,

162
00:11:37,252 --> 00:11:38,719
buy me a drink.

163
00:11:39,354 --> 00:11:40,651
Whatever you want.

164
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:42,718
You want anything?

165
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:44,417
No.

We're building the
Caracas subway.

184
00:12:49,157 --> 00:12:51,785
Sure, there's a lot of money.

185
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:55,659
Well, at least five years.

186
00:12:57,165 --> 00:12:58,462
Listen,

187
00:12:58,633 --> 00:13:02,467
I'm looking for a qualified
company and I'd thought of you.

188
00:13:03,505 --> 00:13:04,494
Of course.

189
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,368
It'll all go through me.

190
00:13:07,275 --> 00:13:08,799
The President himself told me.

191
00:13:21,256 --> 00:13:23,121
I'll call you later, okay?

192
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,591
Yes, Mr. Martel?

193
00:13:27,062 --> 00:13:29,895
Lena, would you come
to my office, please?

194
00:13:30,432 --> 00:13:32,161
<i>I want to dictate a letter.</i>

195
00:13:33,235 --> 00:13:34,600
Yes, right away.

196
00:13:49,985 --> 00:13:51,043
Hello.

197
00:13:51,219 --> 00:13:52,311
Good morning.

198
00:13:52,888 --> 00:13:55,550
The letter is for the
Minister of Industry.

199
00:13:55,857 --> 00:13:57,984
"Dear Antonio, I'm delighted..."

200
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:00,652
I'm sorry.

201
00:14:00,829 --> 00:14:02,694
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

202
00:14:03,665 --> 00:14:06,361
"I'm delighted to
inform you that shortly

203
00:14:06,535 --> 00:14:09,333
"I'll be meeting with a
Venezuelan committee..."

204
00:14:10,672 --> 00:14:11,661
Sorry.

205
00:14:13,008 --> 00:14:16,808
Why not tell me what's wrong?
I'm sure I can help you.

206
00:14:17,812 --> 00:14:19,712
My father's very ill.

207
00:14:19,881 --> 00:14:23,009
He's being discharged today
and I'd like to be there.

208
00:14:23,184 --> 00:14:25,550
Of course. What's
wrong with him?

209
00:14:27,622 --> 00:14:29,852
Stomach cancer, and it's spread.

210
00:14:30,358 --> 00:14:31,450
Lord!

211
00:14:32,527 --> 00:14:33,516
I'm sorry.

212
00:14:34,663 --> 00:14:35,891
Thank you.

213
00:14:49,744 --> 00:14:50,733
Where's Dad?

214
00:14:51,947 --> 00:14:53,471
He's inside, waiting.

215
00:14:53,648 --> 00:14:58,108
I can't believe they left you here,
put out on the street like dogs.

216
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,718
Wasn't the doctor to
operate this week?

217
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:03,790
He was supposed to.

218
00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:07,019
This morning he told us
they were discharging him.

219
00:15:07,195 --> 00:15:08,856
I asked what that meant.

220
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:11,897
He said, "It's simple, it's
July, I'm going on vacation."

221
00:15:12,067 --> 00:15:13,557
On vacation?

222
00:15:13,735 --> 00:15:16,397
I said, "Are you putting
us on the street?"

223
00:15:16,705 --> 00:15:20,368
"No, ma'am, I'm
sending him home."

224
00:15:20,542 --> 00:15:23,443
"But what can I do
with him at home?"

225
00:15:23,612 --> 00:15:27,343
"That's your problem," he said.
"I'm going on vacation."

226
00:15:27,515 --> 00:15:29,005
"He's dying," I said.

227
00:15:29,184 --> 00:15:32,517
"He can die peacefully
at home," he answered.

228
00:15:32,687 --> 00:15:37,021
They can't torture him for 20
days with tests and then do this.

229
00:15:37,192 --> 00:15:38,523
Girls,

230
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,019
have you forgotten about me?

231
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:44,993
- Really, Dad!
- No one could forget you.

232
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:46,497
Sweetheart...

233
00:15:47,535 --> 00:15:48,695
Take it slowly.

234
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:50,861
Isn't it nice to get out?

235
00:16:03,051 --> 00:16:04,609
I'll put the bags in.

236
00:16:32,847 --> 00:16:34,644
You'll be comfortable here.

237
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:37,242
I'll bring your pills.

238
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,544
Try to rest.

239
00:16:45,727 --> 00:16:48,161
I'm leaving now, I've
got a lot to do.

240
00:16:49,164 --> 00:16:51,064
You can call me at any time.

241
00:16:52,033 --> 00:16:54,934
I'll come by in the morning.

242
00:16:56,037 --> 00:16:57,334
Bye, Mom.

243
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:00,701
Take care.

244
00:17:20,795 --> 00:17:22,820
Madame Mylene? Hello,
it's Severine.

245
00:17:22,997 --> 00:17:26,626
Severine! It's been a long time.
How nice to hear you.

246
00:17:26,801 --> 00:17:28,029
I need money.

247
00:17:28,103 --> 00:17:29,127
When?

248
00:17:29,204 --> 00:17:32,799
Now! I'm free at the weekend.
During the week I'm busy.

249
00:17:33,074 --> 00:17:35,372
I'll see what I can do.

250
00:17:36,978 --> 00:17:39,344
Can I call you tonight
if I've got anything?

251
00:17:39,514 --> 00:17:41,744
Of course. I'll be waiting.

252
00:17:52,093 --> 00:17:53,082
Yes?

253
00:17:53,328 --> 00:17:54,352
Severine?

254
00:17:55,363 --> 00:17:56,352
Who is this?

255
00:17:56,431 --> 00:17:58,626
I'm calling on behalf
of Madame Mylene.

256
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:02,361
You're mistaken. There's
no Severine here.

257
00:18:02,537 --> 00:18:05,597
I must have misdialed.
Forgive me.

258
00:18:12,247 --> 00:18:14,738
- The rails, ma'am.
- Thank you.

259
00:18:15,183 --> 00:18:16,912
Hello? Has he called you?

260
00:18:17,185 --> 00:18:18,174
<i>Who?</i>

261
00:18:18,253 --> 00:18:19,652
The client, who else?

262
00:18:20,522 --> 00:18:23,320
- How dare you give him my number!
- I couldn't refuse.

263
00:18:23,992 --> 00:18:26,426
That's not how it's done!
Have you gone crazy?

264
00:18:27,295 --> 00:18:28,626
He knows all about you.

265
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:31,198
I didn't tell him, he
found out himself.

266
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,834
He knows that you tried
your hand at acting

267
00:18:33,902 --> 00:18:36,063
and that at times you've
"performed" for me.

268
00:18:37,705 --> 00:18:39,297
<i>Months ago he made me promise</i>

269
00:18:39,374 --> 00:18:41,604
that if you contacted
me again, I'd call him.

270
00:18:41,843 --> 00:18:43,606
I couldn't refuse,
he's my best client.

271
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:57,780
Yes?

272
00:18:57,859 --> 00:18:59,224
Magdalena, love!

273
00:19:00,028 --> 00:19:02,963
- Mom, how's Dad?
- Awful!

274
00:19:04,098 --> 00:19:06,066
We had a terrible night.

275
00:19:06,234 --> 00:19:09,260
He's been vomiting
blood and everything,

276
00:19:09,437 --> 00:19:11,598
it's like he'd burst inside!

277
00:19:12,207 --> 00:19:14,641
- I don't know what to do!
- I'm on my way.

278
00:19:28,857 --> 00:19:29,846
Yes?

279
00:19:29,924 --> 00:19:31,892
Mr. Martel? It's Lena.

280
00:19:32,794 --> 00:19:34,022
Good morning.

281
00:19:34,195 --> 00:19:36,060
I'm sorry to bother you.

282
00:19:36,231 --> 00:19:37,357
You never bother me.

283
00:19:37,532 --> 00:19:40,797
I'm calling because
my father is dying.

284
00:19:41,636 --> 00:19:43,194
He has to be hospitalized,

285
00:19:43,371 --> 00:19:45,066
<i>but I don't know where.</i>

286
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:49,973
They sent him home yesterday,
and we don't know what to do.

287
00:19:50,144 --> 00:19:51,577
Don't worry.

288
00:19:52,247 --> 00:19:55,182
We'll take him to
a private clinic.

289
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:56,812
I'll see to everything.

290
00:19:57,485 --> 00:20:01,922
Don't worry, Dr. Blasco is the
best digestive surgeon in Europe.

291
00:20:06,327 --> 00:20:07,589
How's the patient?

292
00:20:07,762 --> 00:20:11,095
He arrived in a very bad condition.
I think you know that.

293
00:20:11,266 --> 00:20:12,494
Can you save him?

294
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,329
I'm Ernesto Martel.

295
00:20:14,502 --> 00:20:17,665
We'll do all that's possible,
but right now we can't operate.

296
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:18,931
And tomorrow?

297
00:20:19,908 --> 00:20:22,775
Tomorrow, perhaps. We're
feeding him parenterally

298
00:20:22,944 --> 00:20:25,435
and he'll need a blood
transfusion to recover.

299
00:20:25,613 --> 00:20:27,740
Do the impossible to save him.

300
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:29,941
Of course, that's my duty.

301
00:20:30,551 --> 00:20:33,042
I'll keep you
informed of progress.

302
00:20:33,221 --> 00:20:34,654
May I stay, Doctor?

303
00:20:34,822 --> 00:20:38,519
Of course, you can stay with
him as long as you wish.

304
00:20:38,693 --> 00:20:40,388
Thank you.

305
00:20:42,263 --> 00:20:45,198
I can't thank you enough.

306
00:20:45,366 --> 00:20:47,527
I'm at your disposal, ma'am.

307
00:20:48,202 --> 00:20:50,568
Mom, shall I stay with you?

308
00:20:50,705 --> 00:20:53,196
No, go on, love,
you've done enough.

309
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:56,309
Shall I get you some food?

310
00:20:56,477 --> 00:20:59,503
No, don't bother, I'll
get something later.

311
00:21:00,048 --> 00:21:01,310
I'll call you.

312
00:21:44,092 --> 00:21:45,116
Who is it?

313
00:21:45,193 --> 00:21:46,490
I'm Ray X.

314
00:21:46,594 --> 00:21:48,960
Ray X? No one's called that.

315
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:52,622
It's a nickname. At one time
I did a lot of ecstasy.

316
00:21:53,234 --> 00:21:54,258
What do you want?

317
00:21:54,769 --> 00:21:57,567
I want to write a script with
you and direct it myself.

318
00:21:57,739 --> 00:21:58,899
Are you a director?

319
00:21:59,407 --> 00:22:02,205
I made a very good
documentary 14 years ago.

320
00:22:02,377 --> 00:22:04,436
This would be my
first fiction film.

321
00:22:05,046 --> 00:22:07,810
Call Judit Garcia, my
agent, and talk to her.

322
00:22:07,982 --> 00:22:10,109
She can fix an appointment.

323
00:22:11,419 --> 00:22:14,855
And now I'd like to shower. You
got me out of the bathroom.

324
00:22:21,062 --> 00:22:23,292
Are you going to
stay there all day?

325
00:22:23,464 --> 00:22:25,489
You didn't give me
Judit Garcia's number.

326
00:22:25,666 --> 00:22:28,829
Look it up. She's a well-known
production manager.

327
00:22:29,003 --> 00:22:30,163
I'm leaving.

328
00:22:30,905 --> 00:22:32,167
Yes, go on.

329
00:22:49,857 --> 00:22:52,155
- Yes?
- Hello, Harry, it's me.

330
00:22:52,326 --> 00:22:53,588
Hello, Judit.

331
00:22:53,761 --> 00:22:55,319
A young director rang me.

332
00:22:55,496 --> 00:22:59,023
His name's Ray X and he wants
to write a script with you.

333
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,633
- You know about it?
- Yes.

334
00:23:00,802 --> 00:23:02,531
<i>He wants to see you
this afternoon</i>

335
00:23:02,703 --> 00:23:03,965
or tomorrow.

336
00:23:04,439 --> 00:23:06,771
I asked for an advance
and he's agreed,

337
00:23:07,442 --> 00:23:10,036
but I can't go with you, I'm
busy with the Americans.

338
00:23:10,812 --> 00:23:14,179
Okay, I'll see him and
tell you all about it.

339
00:23:14,348 --> 00:23:17,181
I hope you like him, he
seems to be well-heeled.

340
00:23:17,351 --> 00:23:19,683
- Have you seen him?
- No, from his voice,

341
00:23:19,854 --> 00:23:22,550
and from the check I'll ask
for as soon as I hang up.

342
00:23:22,623 --> 00:23:25,990
I'll send Diego so you're not alone.
Ciao.

343
00:23:52,386 --> 00:23:53,410
Hello.

344
00:23:53,921 --> 00:23:56,981
- I'm here to see Harry Caine.
- Yes, he's in his office.

345
00:24:11,672 --> 00:24:12,764
Hello.

346
00:24:13,074 --> 00:24:14,405
I'm Ray X.

347
00:24:15,076 --> 00:24:16,100
How are you?

348
00:24:17,745 --> 00:24:18,837
Sit down.

349
00:24:31,259 --> 00:24:32,317
I'm listening.

350
00:24:33,094 --> 00:24:36,757
I really like your work.
I've seen all of it.

351
00:24:37,932 --> 00:24:39,126
Thank you.

352
00:24:40,034 --> 00:24:41,695
Let's get to the point.

353
00:24:42,436 --> 00:24:44,131
What kind of story do
you want to write?

354
00:24:47,375 --> 00:24:48,467
Well...

355
00:24:48,943 --> 00:24:49,967
Yes?

356
00:24:50,144 --> 00:24:52,135
I'd like to write a story about

357
00:24:53,714 --> 00:24:56,376
a son's revenge on
his father's memory.

358
00:24:56,951 --> 00:24:58,919
Why does the son want revenge?

359
00:25:01,489 --> 00:25:04,390
The father destroyed him
and ruined his life.

360
00:25:04,492 --> 00:25:05,516
How?

361
00:25:06,827 --> 00:25:09,387
The father is a violent
man, a homophobe,

362
00:25:09,564 --> 00:25:11,930
unscrupulous and very powerful.

363
00:25:12,633 --> 00:25:14,794
But the son is a sensitive boy,

364
00:25:14,969 --> 00:25:16,334
with artistic interests,

365
00:25:16,504 --> 00:25:18,699
but he's got lots of
complexes and he's weak.

366
00:25:18,873 --> 00:25:21,307
He always tries to
please his father.

367
00:25:21,475 --> 00:25:24,740
He's a homosexual, but he got
married twice, like his father.

368
00:25:25,313 --> 00:25:26,871
And he separated, like he did.

369
00:25:27,748 --> 00:25:31,479
He's got a son, who hates him
as much as he hated his father.

370
00:25:32,053 --> 00:25:33,816
When the father dies,

371
00:25:33,988 --> 00:25:36,513
the son can finally
rebuild his life.

372
00:25:37,158 --> 00:25:38,489
That's his salvation,

373
00:25:38,593 --> 00:25:40,026
his revenge,

374
00:25:40,194 --> 00:25:41,786
and the story I want to tell.

375
00:25:41,963 --> 00:25:45,023
I fear I'm not the writer
you're looking for.

376
00:25:45,533 --> 00:25:46,761
You are.

377
00:25:47,034 --> 00:25:48,763
More than you know.

378
00:25:50,171 --> 00:25:51,399
I'll pay whatever you ask.

379
00:25:52,039 --> 00:25:53,700
It's too personal.

380
00:25:54,041 --> 00:25:55,668
Make it your own.

381
00:25:55,843 --> 00:25:57,367
Thank you, but no.

382
00:25:57,545 --> 00:25:59,445
Now, if you don't mind... Diego!

383
00:26:04,318 --> 00:26:05,842
I'll leave you my number.

384
00:26:07,054 --> 00:26:08,078
Come along.

385
00:26:11,125 --> 00:26:12,922
In case you change your mind.

386
00:26:13,227 --> 00:26:15,058
- Come along!
- Leave me alone!

387
00:26:17,465 --> 00:26:19,729
I'm sure we'll see
each other again.

388
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,367
In my case, it would
be a miracle.

389
00:26:21,535 --> 00:26:23,560
- Please, come with me.
- I'm coming!

390
00:26:25,206 --> 00:26:26,264
Goodbye.

391
00:26:36,384 --> 00:26:37,783
Son of a bitch!

392
00:26:41,389 --> 00:26:44,187
- He was talking about himself, right?
- I guess.

393
00:26:44,358 --> 00:26:46,189
Look in the top drawer.

394
00:26:47,194 --> 00:26:49,890
Look through the photos
of the '94 shoot.

395
00:26:50,064 --> 00:26:51,429
He may be in one of them.

396
00:27:14,522 --> 00:27:15,819
Keep looking.

397
00:27:33,641 --> 00:27:34,630
Here he is!

398
00:27:34,775 --> 00:27:36,367
Describe the photo.

399
00:27:36,877 --> 00:27:38,538
He's with you on the shoot.

400
00:27:39,213 --> 00:27:42,876
He's got long, straight hair and
he's holding a video camera.

401
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:44,278
I was almost certain.

402
00:27:44,452 --> 00:27:45,476
Who is he?

403
00:27:46,554 --> 00:27:48,078
Ernesto Martel's son.

404
00:27:48,723 --> 00:27:50,122
What can he want now?

405
00:27:52,727 --> 00:27:55,161
Put the photos away
and close the drawer.

406
00:28:23,457 --> 00:28:25,049
<i>Hello, it's me.</i>

407
00:28:26,861 --> 00:28:28,920
<i>We have to talk about our son.</i>

408
00:28:29,096 --> 00:28:30,461
I can't talk now, Rosana.

409
00:28:30,631 --> 00:28:32,428
<i>I caught him trying
on my dresses.</i>

410
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,797
It's your fault. You made him
effeminate to humiliate me.

411
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:38,666
<i>I'm sending him to you. After
all, you're his father.</i>

412
00:28:38,839 --> 00:28:43,003
If I haven't been a good father for
19 years, I doubt I'll learn now.

413
00:28:43,477 --> 00:28:44,774
I have to go.

414
00:28:45,413 --> 00:28:49,406
And tell him if he wants to talk
to me, he can ring me himself.

415
00:28:51,018 --> 00:28:52,747
Don't be so hard on them.

416
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,148
They're blackmailers!

417
00:28:54,255 --> 00:28:56,689
- Help me with my necklace.
- Of course.

418
00:28:57,358 --> 00:28:59,417
Why not invite your son
here for a few days?

419
00:28:59,593 --> 00:29:01,527
That's what his
mother just said.

420
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:05,863
But it's best not to
involve you with them.

421
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,492
He'd keep me company.

422
00:29:09,103 --> 00:29:10,695
Does he like the
cinema or the theater?

423
00:29:10,771 --> 00:29:12,068
Very much, I think.

424
00:29:14,074 --> 00:29:16,338
His mother says he's
a bit of a fairy.

425
00:29:16,944 --> 00:29:20,311
If I invite him, I'd like
you to tell me if it's true

426
00:29:20,714 --> 00:29:22,409
and if you think
it can be fixed.

427
00:29:23,184 --> 00:29:24,208
How should I know?

428
00:29:24,385 --> 00:29:27,013
- I'm not asking you to screw him.
- Thanks a lot!

429
00:29:27,188 --> 00:29:29,213
But you pretty girls
know those things.

430
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:31,483
Call him, but I won't do that.

431
00:29:34,094 --> 00:29:37,063
<i>It's disgraceful, Ernesto. I won't
say a thing about our separation,</i>

432
00:29:37,131 --> 00:29:38,189
<i>but I don't like you
living with a man.</i>

433
00:29:38,265 --> 00:29:39,254
<i>What'll your children think?</i>

434
00:29:39,767 --> 00:29:41,632
That their father is homosexual,

435
00:29:41,702 --> 00:29:44,364
he's got good taste
and he's very lucky.

436
00:29:45,372 --> 00:29:48,136
If they love me and you don't turn
them against me, they'll accept it.

437
00:29:48,209 --> 00:29:50,200
<i>You should've told me
before we got married!</i>

438
00:29:50,744 --> 00:29:52,871
If you'd stopped thinking
about my father's fortune,

439
00:29:52,947 --> 00:29:55,575
<i>- you'd have realized.
- What do you mean?</i>

440
00:29:55,649 --> 00:29:58,812
I'm hanging up. Pain in the ass!
I've got another call.

441
00:30:01,789 --> 00:30:03,780
I hope it's not
your other ex-wife.

442
00:30:03,958 --> 00:30:05,084
I hope not.

443
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:07,750
Never get married.

444
00:30:07,928 --> 00:30:09,896
I'm not planning to right now.

445
00:30:11,732 --> 00:30:12,960
This is Judit Garcia.

446
00:30:13,133 --> 00:30:15,260
Hello, Judit. Did
you get the money?

447
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:17,760
I don't want it.

448
00:30:18,105 --> 00:30:20,471
I've just sent it
back to you, Ernesto.

449
00:30:21,075 --> 00:30:23,839
Won't you call me Ray?
That's my artistic name.

450
00:30:24,345 --> 00:30:26,108
Artistic?

451
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:27,842
What are you trying to do?

452
00:30:28,015 --> 00:30:29,505
Erase my father's name.

453
00:30:30,251 --> 00:30:31,980
What's that got
to do with Harry?

454
00:30:32,152 --> 00:30:34,347
I've wanted to see him for ages.

455
00:30:34,522 --> 00:30:37,980
And it's true I want to make a film
and have him write the script.

456
00:30:38,158 --> 00:30:39,785
I've got the male lead.

457
00:30:42,229 --> 00:30:43,526
You're not a director.

458
00:30:43,697 --> 00:30:46,860
If you saw my documentary,
you'd change your mind.

459
00:30:47,701 --> 00:30:48,827
Ernesto,

460
00:30:49,169 --> 00:30:50,636
forget about us.

461
00:30:50,704 --> 00:30:52,296
Don't be scared of me.

462
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,766
I'm not my father.

463
00:30:54,041 --> 00:30:55,872
Stay away from Harry.

464
00:30:56,043 --> 00:30:59,137
If you try to see him again,
I'll report you for harassment!

465
00:31:01,916 --> 00:31:04,885
I really don't want to
scout for locations

466
00:31:05,452 --> 00:31:07,443
but the Americans are
paying me a fortune

467
00:31:07,521 --> 00:31:08,988
and we need the money.

468
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:12,058
Go on, don't worry about me.

469
00:31:12,593 --> 00:31:14,458
Give me Tonino Guerra's book.

470
00:31:15,329 --> 00:31:17,194
I'm worried about Harry, too.

471
00:31:17,565 --> 00:31:19,362
Look after him while I'm gone.

472
00:31:19,533 --> 00:31:22,832
I'm busy, I can't spend
all day with him.

473
00:31:22,903 --> 00:31:24,370
It's just two weeks!

474
00:31:24,638 --> 00:31:26,629
Harry's fine on his own.

475
00:31:27,408 --> 00:31:29,467
It's because of Ernesto Junior.

476
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:32,740
I'd like you to keep an eye out
so if he turns up again or calls,

477
00:31:32,913 --> 00:31:34,380
you can let me know right away.

478
00:31:34,548 --> 00:31:36,038
Why are you so worried?

479
00:31:36,216 --> 00:31:38,207
He's crazy. I don't trust him.

480
00:31:38,385 --> 00:31:39,818
Why?

481
00:31:39,987 --> 00:31:42,581
- It's a long story.
- Give me a summary.

482
00:31:43,157 --> 00:31:45,182
This isn't the time.

483
00:31:47,294 --> 00:31:48,488
For you, it never is!

484
00:31:49,763 --> 00:31:51,822
If you really mind
looking after Harry,

485
00:31:51,999 --> 00:31:54,593
I'll just stay in Madrid,
or I'll hire someone.

486
00:31:55,436 --> 00:31:59,133
I don't mind keeping him company,
but I'm sick of all the secrecy.

487
00:32:03,444 --> 00:32:05,135
When is your mother back?

488
00:32:05,312 --> 00:32:08,145
I'm not sure. In
ten days, I think.

489
00:32:12,953 --> 00:32:14,215
What are you looking at?

490
00:32:14,955 --> 00:32:16,513
A poster that says "Give blood".

491
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:18,285
And you want to give yours?

492
00:32:18,359 --> 00:32:19,383
No, no.

493
00:32:19,526 --> 00:32:21,892
I liked the sound of it.

494
00:32:22,296 --> 00:32:24,355
It would be a great
title for a film.

495
00:32:24,531 --> 00:32:26,431
Yes, it sounds good.

496
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,295
Like a vampire film.

497
00:32:28,469 --> 00:32:29,800
That's true.

498
00:32:29,937 --> 00:32:32,963
Imagine that behind the ad
there's a group of vampires

499
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:34,903
who work in various
donor centers,

500
00:32:35,075 --> 00:32:37,236
they keep the blood
that's donated

501
00:32:37,411 --> 00:32:38,901
and use it themselves.

502
00:32:39,013 --> 00:32:42,141
Your mother would like that story.
We'll write it.

503
00:32:43,417 --> 00:32:45,317
<i>Give Blood.</i>

504
00:32:45,653 --> 00:32:47,484
The vampires live
like the Chinese,

505
00:32:47,554 --> 00:32:51,012
as part of Spanish society but
without attracting attention,

506
00:32:51,191 --> 00:32:54,058
and like the Chinese they also
control several industries.

507
00:32:54,228 --> 00:32:56,253
Sunglasses, for example.

508
00:32:56,430 --> 00:33:00,161
And late night bars,
discos, after-hours...

509
00:33:00,334 --> 00:33:04,395
They don't need drugs to stay awake
so they're the best night workers.

510
00:33:04,571 --> 00:33:06,334
And the sun cream business.

511
00:33:06,507 --> 00:33:10,273
They're sensitive to climate
change and to holes in the ozone.

512
00:33:10,444 --> 00:33:13,038
Their sun creams are the
best on the market.

513
00:33:13,213 --> 00:33:14,271
That's good.

514
00:33:14,448 --> 00:33:18,942
It must be a very thick cream, like
armor, to protect them all day.

515
00:33:19,586 --> 00:33:21,315
That's how the story begins.

516
00:33:21,488 --> 00:33:24,355
A very beautiful
girl, totally naked,

517
00:33:24,525 --> 00:33:27,358
covering her body with
a really thick cream

518
00:33:27,528 --> 00:33:29,792
before going to work
in a donor center.

519
00:33:29,963 --> 00:33:33,262
Her body has a beautiful,
velvety pallor.

520
00:33:33,934 --> 00:33:35,492
What a great beginning!

521
00:33:35,869 --> 00:33:37,564
We need a love story.

522
00:33:38,238 --> 00:33:40,365
A mixed love story,

523
00:33:40,574 --> 00:33:43,236
between the young vampire
girl and a normal boy.

524
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:45,403
She works in one of those
blood donor centers

525
00:33:45,479 --> 00:33:47,310
where they use the
blood themselves.

526
00:33:47,781 --> 00:33:51,273
He goes there to give blood.
They instantly like each other.

527
00:33:52,019 --> 00:33:55,614
After she puts the needle in his
vein, she gets really aroused.

528
00:33:56,056 --> 00:33:57,318
They start dating.

529
00:33:57,391 --> 00:33:59,382
But she doesn't want him
to become a vampire.

530
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:02,258
Those vampires don't proselytize.
They don't bite people

531
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:04,891
unless it's really necessary.

532
00:34:05,065 --> 00:34:06,965
But they like sex, right?

533
00:34:07,301 --> 00:34:08,290
Sure.

534
00:34:09,002 --> 00:34:12,631
That'll be one of the problems
because we need some tension.

535
00:34:14,408 --> 00:34:16,239
They really desire each other

536
00:34:16,410 --> 00:34:18,674
but when it comes to
screwing she holds back.

537
00:34:18,979 --> 00:34:20,139
Why?

538
00:34:20,314 --> 00:34:23,750
In case she loses control and bites
his jugular when she's aroused.

539
00:34:23,917 --> 00:34:25,976
When they're randy, she
lets him do everything,

540
00:34:26,053 --> 00:34:29,454
in front, behind, whatever,
except kiss her on the mouth.

541
00:34:29,523 --> 00:34:30,547
And her breasts?

542
00:34:31,859 --> 00:34:33,884
That's a high risk area.

543
00:34:34,261 --> 00:34:37,287
When he kisses her breasts
she has to cover her face

544
00:34:37,364 --> 00:34:40,094
with the pillow and she rips
it apart with her teeth!

545
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,992
And when she eats his dick?

546
00:34:42,302 --> 00:34:44,998
No blowjobs. She'd tear
it off right away.

547
00:34:45,172 --> 00:34:48,073
And how does he feel about that?
You can do without kisses,

548
00:34:48,142 --> 00:34:49,803
but it's tough when they
won't eat your dick.

549
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:52,874
He's so in love he accepts it.

550
00:34:53,147 --> 00:34:55,980
When they know each other
better, she'll wear a muzzle,

551
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:57,640
to protect both of them.

552
00:34:57,818 --> 00:35:01,811
When she gets excited, she has
a kind of dental erection

553
00:35:01,989 --> 00:35:04,685
and her mouth grows out,
like she was a wolf.

554
00:35:07,127 --> 00:35:08,856
I really like your story.

555
00:35:09,496 --> 00:35:10,758
You'll sign this one.

556
00:35:11,732 --> 00:35:15,259
I'll be your sparring partner,
like you've always been for me.

557
00:35:21,108 --> 00:35:23,440
The music you play
is fucking great.

558
00:35:24,812 --> 00:35:27,246
And I really like you.
Did he tell you?

559
00:35:27,748 --> 00:35:31,946
I want us to be great friends, and
you have to tell me everything.

560
00:35:32,119 --> 00:35:33,780
Let me work.

561
00:35:34,288 --> 00:35:36,279
You have to tell me everything.

562
00:35:38,158 --> 00:35:39,648
I need liquid.

563
00:35:44,598 --> 00:35:47,032
Sorry, he's blasted on GHB.

564
00:35:47,201 --> 00:35:48,896
I don't like being felt up.

565
00:35:50,103 --> 00:35:52,503
You want a bit of MDMA?

566
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:54,866
Just a bit.

567
00:35:55,042 --> 00:35:56,373
Just a bit.

568
00:35:56,844 --> 00:35:58,436
I'm working tomorrow.

569
00:36:01,281 --> 00:36:03,841
We're doing a great
vampire script.

570
00:36:03,917 --> 00:36:05,043
Yeah?

571
00:36:23,871 --> 00:36:24,997
Want some GHB?

572
00:36:26,139 --> 00:36:27,970
I've had some MDMA.

573
00:36:39,486 --> 00:36:43,149
- I think your friend likes me.
- What's up?

574
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:45,080
Diego! What's up?

575
00:36:45,259 --> 00:36:46,658
What is it?

576
00:36:47,761 --> 00:36:49,661
- Is that yours?
- Coca Cola with GHB.

577
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:52,594
Asshole! Why did you put
it beside his drink?

578
00:36:52,766 --> 00:36:54,666
Take it easy.

579
00:36:54,835 --> 00:36:56,132
He's wasted.

580
00:36:57,304 --> 00:37:00,171
Get some ice. Call an ambulance.

581
00:37:25,232 --> 00:37:27,223
<i>- Yes?
- Diego?</i>

582
00:37:27,367 --> 00:37:30,393
No, I'm a friend of his.
Diego's sick.

583
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:32,538
We're taking him to Emergency.

584
00:37:32,706 --> 00:37:36,039
<i>Why? What's happened?
Can I speak to him?</i>

585
00:37:36,209 --> 00:37:37,676
No, it's...

586
00:37:38,445 --> 00:37:39,810
<i>Where are you taking him?</i>

587
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:42,380
- Where are you taking him?
- Quiron Hospital.

588
00:37:42,549 --> 00:37:43,811
Quiron Hospital.

589
00:37:45,185 --> 00:37:46,846
Come on, get in.

590
00:37:47,187 --> 00:37:48,950
He's coming.

591
00:37:49,189 --> 00:37:50,781
That's his jacket.

592
00:37:51,224 --> 00:37:52,282
Okay.

593
00:38:19,619 --> 00:38:21,849
- Excuse me, do you need help?
- Yes, please.

594
00:38:22,022 --> 00:38:24,013
I have to hang up. You
want the hospital?

595
00:38:24,191 --> 00:38:26,056
- Yes, I do.
- I'll go with you.

596
00:38:26,626 --> 00:38:28,218
I'll hold on to you.

597
00:38:30,063 --> 00:38:32,793
- You want Reception?
- Yes.

598
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:01,659
How are you?

599
00:39:02,596 --> 00:39:04,996
I don't know. Shocked.

600
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,261
Did you speak to my mother?

601
00:39:08,435 --> 00:39:09,493
Yes.

602
00:39:10,237 --> 00:39:13,172
- Did you tell her about the coma?
- No! Are you crazy?

603
00:39:13,573 --> 00:39:15,939
Anyway, it was only six hours.

604
00:39:16,777 --> 00:39:20,372
If you ever tell her,
say you fainted.

605
00:39:20,914 --> 00:39:22,381
Or whatever.

606
00:39:23,683 --> 00:39:27,414
I told her you ate something
that disagreed with you.

607
00:39:29,022 --> 00:39:30,512
Did she believe you?

608
00:39:31,024 --> 00:39:32,582
I don't know.

609
00:39:33,226 --> 00:39:37,128
She wanted to rush back, but
I persuaded her not to.

610
00:39:41,234 --> 00:39:42,565
Are you asleep?

611
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:45,561
No, I'm not sleepy anymore.

612
00:39:46,706 --> 00:39:49,072
- You want to talk?
- No.

613
00:39:51,044 --> 00:39:52,511
You want me to talk?

614
00:39:53,814 --> 00:39:55,873
I don't know. If you want to...

615
00:39:56,383 --> 00:39:58,374
I mean, to distract you.

616
00:39:59,352 --> 00:40:01,183
Before I went into films

617
00:40:01,888 --> 00:40:04,322
I was very good at
telling stories.

618
00:40:05,358 --> 00:40:10,091
Then will you tell me why my mother
is so afraid of Ernesto Junior?

619
00:40:10,831 --> 00:40:12,230
Is she?

620
00:40:13,467 --> 00:40:15,935
She made me promise
I'd keep an eye out

621
00:40:16,002 --> 00:40:17,435
in case he reappeared.

622
00:40:19,206 --> 00:40:21,106
She didn't explain why?

623
00:40:22,175 --> 00:40:23,938
She never explains anything.

624
00:40:26,246 --> 00:40:28,373
It's a long story.

625
00:40:28,815 --> 00:40:30,442
That's what she says.

626
00:40:31,284 --> 00:40:32,842
How did you meet him?

627
00:40:35,122 --> 00:40:37,488
We met him fourteen years ago.

628
00:40:38,959 --> 00:40:43,453
In an office we'd rented
to prepare my latest film.

629
00:40:45,799 --> 00:40:48,734
<i>After writing and
directing five dramas,</i>

630
00:40:48,902 --> 00:40:51,393
<i>I'd finally written a comedy,</i>

631
00:40:51,571 --> 00:40:53,129
<i>or so I thought</i>

632
00:40:53,807 --> 00:40:55,297
<i>I wanted to change genres</i>

633
00:40:55,475 --> 00:40:57,033
<i>and take a risk.</i>

634
00:40:57,544 --> 00:40:59,034
<i>And I certainly did.</i>

635
00:40:59,412 --> 00:41:01,039
<i>Take a risk, I mean.</i>

636
00:41:05,719 --> 00:41:06,743
Mateo...

637
00:41:08,522 --> 00:41:09,853
There's a girl here.

638
00:41:10,023 --> 00:41:11,684
She doesn't have an appointment.

639
00:41:11,758 --> 00:41:12,884
What's she like?

640
00:41:14,461 --> 00:41:16,452
Too pretty to be funny.

641
00:41:17,063 --> 00:41:18,121
Really?

642
00:41:18,265 --> 00:41:21,200
She's the financier Ernesto
Martel's mistress.

643
00:41:21,368 --> 00:41:22,733
She's here with his son.

644
00:41:22,836 --> 00:41:23,860
Is she an actress?

645
00:41:24,337 --> 00:41:27,067
If she's been with that man
for two years, she must be.

646
00:41:28,008 --> 00:41:30,875
But come out and say
hello, just to be polite.

647
00:41:31,044 --> 00:41:32,875
You have to be nice
to important men.

648
00:41:32,946 --> 00:41:34,709
- You never know.
- Okay.

649
00:41:39,519 --> 00:41:40,816
GIRLS AND SUITCASES

650
00:41:57,137 --> 00:41:58,161
Hello.

651
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:01,030
- Lena.
- I'm Mateo.

652
00:42:01,408 --> 00:42:03,569
I'm Ernesto Martel, Junior.

653
00:42:03,643 --> 00:42:04,667
How are you?

654
00:42:04,744 --> 00:42:06,712
I apologize for
turning up like this.

655
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:09,442
I heard you were holding
auditions for your next film.

656
00:42:09,616 --> 00:42:11,982
- Yes.
- I'd love to audition.

657
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,719
I can come another day.

658
00:42:15,222 --> 00:42:18,191
Now that you're here,
we'll read something.

659
00:42:19,059 --> 00:42:20,424
Okay.

660
00:42:33,406 --> 00:42:35,340
<i>The reading didn't work.</i>

661
00:42:35,742 --> 00:42:38,176
<i>We were both too nervous.</i>

662
00:42:39,479 --> 00:42:42,414
<i>The first meeting only
served to show me</i>

663
00:42:43,149 --> 00:42:46,277
<i>that the mere presence of
that woman disturbed me.</i>

664
00:42:57,497 --> 00:42:59,226
Where were you this morning?

665
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,558
Didn't Ernesto tell you?

666
00:43:01,735 --> 00:43:03,202
I didn't ask him.

667
00:43:04,871 --> 00:43:07,305
We went to see a film director

668
00:43:07,474 --> 00:43:08,634
to do an audition.

669
00:43:08,808 --> 00:43:10,708
An audition? Why?

670
00:43:11,478 --> 00:43:13,002
I want to work.

671
00:43:13,747 --> 00:43:15,908
Weren't you going to
redecorate the house?

672
00:43:16,082 --> 00:43:18,209
You have to change the
furniture, carpets, lamps...

673
00:43:18,385 --> 00:43:22,116
I don't know how to do that.
Get in a decorator.

674
00:43:22,289 --> 00:43:24,154
Even if I do, you'll
have to guide him.

675
00:43:24,324 --> 00:43:25,450
That way, you'll learn.

676
00:43:25,825 --> 00:43:27,759
I want to be an actress.

677
00:43:27,827 --> 00:43:29,317
I always have.

678
00:43:31,665 --> 00:43:35,123
You tried before, and
look how you ended up.

679
00:43:37,237 --> 00:43:38,727
That was below the belt.

680
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:42,674
I'm sorry, my love, forgive me.

681
00:43:45,178 --> 00:43:46,839
I'm going upstairs.

682
00:43:48,682 --> 00:43:50,673
Lena, please.

683
00:43:50,950 --> 00:43:53,885
Don't get angry,
darling, I beg you.

684
00:43:54,054 --> 00:43:56,614
In any case, don't worry.
I was no good.

685
00:43:56,790 --> 00:43:58,223
I was very nervous.

686
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:02,260
Telephone. It's Mr.
Mateo Blanco.

687
00:44:03,363 --> 00:44:04,591
Come in!

688
00:44:06,232 --> 00:44:08,063
He says it's important.

689
00:44:08,234 --> 00:44:09,360
Yes?

690
00:44:11,071 --> 00:44:12,299
Yes.

691
00:44:13,373 --> 00:44:14,362
Of course.

692
00:44:15,408 --> 00:44:16,534
Very well.

693
00:44:17,777 --> 00:44:18,801
Thank you.

694
00:44:23,783 --> 00:44:25,546
That was the director.

695
00:44:26,219 --> 00:44:29,450
The audition wasn't enough,
he wants to see me again.

696
00:44:29,856 --> 00:44:31,118
What are you going to do?

697
00:44:32,025 --> 00:44:33,287
Go and see him, no?

698
00:44:34,994 --> 00:44:36,484
I need to do something.

699
00:44:37,163 --> 00:44:40,030
- I've always wanted to be an actress.
- And what about me?

700
00:44:41,668 --> 00:44:45,627
This is Magdalena Rivero. I want
to cancel my massage tomorrow.

701
00:44:45,805 --> 00:44:48,501
I'll call you another time.
Thank you.

702
00:44:49,743 --> 00:44:51,608
They still haven't
given me the part.

703
00:44:51,745 --> 00:44:52,734
They will.

704
00:44:53,279 --> 00:44:55,474
If they do, it won't
change anything,

705
00:44:55,648 --> 00:44:58,082
except that I'll be
working too, like you.

706
00:44:58,251 --> 00:45:01,482
And at night we'll tell
each other what we've done.

707
00:45:02,622 --> 00:45:04,317
Why don't we get married?

708
00:45:04,491 --> 00:45:05,515
What?

709
00:45:05,692 --> 00:45:07,683
I'm asking you to marry me.

710
00:45:08,361 --> 00:45:11,455
Haven't you got married and
divorced enough times?

711
00:45:11,631 --> 00:45:13,826
With you, it would
be the first time.

712
00:45:14,968 --> 00:45:18,096
We've been living
together two years.

713
00:45:18,271 --> 00:45:21,399
We're fine like this,
don't you think?

714
00:45:24,177 --> 00:45:25,678
It seems you don't.

715
00:45:26,613 --> 00:45:30,606
Martel offered to produce the film.
Your mother didn't want that.

716
00:45:31,017 --> 00:45:33,485
We were waiting for a subsidy
from the Ministry...

717
00:45:33,553 --> 00:45:34,542
Can't I help?

718
00:45:34,621 --> 00:45:36,384
No, I want to give
you a demonstration.

719
00:45:36,756 --> 00:45:38,485
...and a television pre-sale.

720
00:45:39,526 --> 00:45:41,721
But that would take months,

721
00:45:41,861 --> 00:45:44,591
and I was in a real hurry
to start shooting.

722
00:45:45,098 --> 00:45:47,157
Just like Audrey.
Spot on, faggot.

723
00:45:47,233 --> 00:45:49,098
- Totally Audrey!
- Yes, it's true.

724
00:45:50,103 --> 00:45:51,331
This guy's a pain!

725
00:45:51,404 --> 00:45:52,837
Move closer to the mirror.

726
00:45:58,077 --> 00:45:59,977
Light up your face.

727
00:46:00,847 --> 00:46:02,405
Now look at me in profile

728
00:46:02,582 --> 00:46:05,312
with an exaggerated
smile, like the model.

729
00:46:05,485 --> 00:46:07,419
Okay. Like that one?

730
00:46:07,587 --> 00:46:09,214
Yes. Come on.

731
00:46:09,689 --> 00:46:10,713
Now.

732
00:46:11,825 --> 00:46:15,022
More of a smile in your eyes
and close your mouth more.

733
00:46:15,195 --> 00:46:16,321
Come on. Now.

734
00:46:20,099 --> 00:46:21,498
Very good. Again.

735
00:46:22,168 --> 00:46:24,295
Open your mouth a little more.
Now.

736
00:46:25,104 --> 00:46:26,935
Wonderful, very good.

737
00:46:27,106 --> 00:46:28,095
Again.

738
00:46:28,641 --> 00:46:29,972
That's it. Great.

739
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:31,701
- Art!
- Totally!

740
00:46:31,778 --> 00:46:32,802
Great.

741
00:46:33,079 --> 00:46:36,310
Now I'd like to try
something much more daring.

742
00:46:36,816 --> 00:46:39,478
A platinum blonde wig.
Something very pop.

743
00:46:39,552 --> 00:46:40,576
I've got one!

744
00:46:41,354 --> 00:46:44,255
I've got a Goldie Hawn
type with much more volume

745
00:46:44,424 --> 00:46:47,723
- that'll look fabulous.
- But she mustn't look like a poodle.

746
00:46:47,894 --> 00:46:48,918
- No?
- No.

747
00:46:49,095 --> 00:46:51,689
- If she isn't a poodle, she isn't Goldie.
- Then forget it.

748
00:46:51,764 --> 00:46:55,131
I told you he wouldn't
like Goldie, faggot.

749
00:46:55,201 --> 00:46:57,260
He wears it when
he gets dressed.

750
00:46:57,437 --> 00:46:59,598
- So, platinum blonde.
- Yes.

751
00:46:59,772 --> 00:47:01,205
I'll change your make up.

752
00:47:02,642 --> 00:47:03,666
Get out of the way!

753
00:47:03,743 --> 00:47:06,769
Look, the wig's false,
it's really bad.

754
00:47:06,946 --> 00:47:09,744
It's Kanecalon fiber,
but it looks fabulous.

755
00:47:09,916 --> 00:47:11,406
Okay, let's have a look.

756
00:47:11,584 --> 00:47:13,381
You'll flip out.

757
00:47:18,591 --> 00:47:20,058
Put on these earrings.

758
00:47:33,473 --> 00:47:35,498
Judit, can you
move to your left?

759
00:47:47,554 --> 00:47:48,578
Are you tired?

760
00:47:49,022 --> 00:47:50,114
No.

761
00:47:52,525 --> 00:47:54,584
Don't smile.

762
00:47:54,761 --> 00:47:56,319
The wig is false enough.

763
00:47:56,963 --> 00:47:58,123
That's it.

764
00:47:58,865 --> 00:47:59,889
Wonderful.

765
00:48:00,667 --> 00:48:02,794
<i>From the start, Judit
didn't like Lena.</i>

766
00:48:03,836 --> 00:48:06,464
<i>But I liked her more every day.</i>

767
00:48:08,174 --> 00:48:10,301
<i>And Ernesto Junior liked me</i>

768
00:48:10,476 --> 00:48:12,637
<i>and I intended to use that.</i>

769
00:48:13,613 --> 00:48:17,049
<i>His father had asked him to make
a documentary about the shoot.</i>

770
00:48:19,719 --> 00:48:21,550
<i>As for Ernesto Senior,</i>

771
00:48:21,721 --> 00:48:24,918
<i>I'd never met a man so
obsessed by a woman.</i>

772
00:48:25,558 --> 00:48:26,991
<i>He was producing the film</i>

773
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:29,460
<i>in a desperate attempt
not to lose Lena.</i>

774
00:48:31,931 --> 00:48:34,525
This is shit! It's
incomprehensible!

775
00:48:34,701 --> 00:48:36,100
Action!

776
00:48:36,869 --> 00:48:39,360
<i>In the midst of that
emotional panorama,</i>

777
00:48:40,106 --> 00:48:41,630
<i>we started shooting.</i>

778
00:48:45,979 --> 00:48:49,574
Now think of all the times
you've made gazpacho for Ivan

779
00:48:49,749 --> 00:48:51,239
and how he enjoyed it.

780
00:48:51,918 --> 00:48:54,045
And that really hurts you.

781
00:49:18,111 --> 00:49:20,511
We'll do the first time
you come back home

782
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:21,979
after a photo session.

783
00:49:22,582 --> 00:49:25,881
As soon as you open the door, you
look over at the answer phone.

784
00:49:25,952 --> 00:49:26,976
Okay.

785
00:49:27,053 --> 00:49:28,918
If it's flashing,
it may be Ivan.

786
00:49:29,088 --> 00:49:32,387
"'If it isn't flashing, it'll
be another day of despair

787
00:49:32,458 --> 00:49:34,756
"'because you've been looking
for him for two days.'

788
00:49:34,827 --> 00:49:36,692
"'All right, okay, okay.

789
00:49:36,829 --> 00:49:39,525
"'Listen, did you like the
bit with the tomatoes?'

790
00:49:39,699 --> 00:49:41,929
"'Yes, a lot, it moved me.'

791
00:49:42,101 --> 00:49:44,331
"'Me, too. It really moved me.'

792
00:49:44,504 --> 00:49:47,871
"'It's amazing that you could
be moved by tomatoes.'

793
00:49:48,041 --> 00:49:49,201
"'It wasn't the tomatoes,

794
00:49:49,375 --> 00:49:51,843
"'it was the nice things
you were saying to me."'

795
00:49:54,514 --> 00:49:56,345
Do you think they
like each other?

796
00:49:59,052 --> 00:50:00,610
Do you think they
like each other?

797
00:50:00,687 --> 00:50:01,779
Me?

798
00:50:02,188 --> 00:50:03,450
I don't know anything.

799
00:50:04,290 --> 00:50:05,882
I just look at their lips.

800
00:50:07,994 --> 00:50:09,188
"'Samples?'

801
00:50:10,196 --> 00:50:11,130
"'What do you think?"'

802
00:50:17,570 --> 00:50:19,834
- Cut!
- Very good. Print it.

803
00:50:24,377 --> 00:50:27,039
- Are you going to do anything?
- No, you can go.

804
00:50:27,213 --> 00:50:28,544
I don't mind staying.

805
00:50:29,082 --> 00:50:31,812
You should go. I'm going
to check some wigs.

806
00:50:31,984 --> 00:50:33,417
Wigs? I love that!

807
00:50:33,586 --> 00:50:34,644
No, you don't.

808
00:50:34,821 --> 00:50:37,756
You've filmed hours of wigs.
This is more of the same.

809
00:50:37,924 --> 00:50:39,152
And Lena?

810
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:41,586
Lena?

811
00:50:42,128 --> 00:50:45,495
After we've tried the new
wigs she wants a massage.

812
00:50:45,565 --> 00:50:46,998
She's got a cramp.

813
00:50:47,166 --> 00:50:49,327
I haven't got any cramps.

814
00:50:49,936 --> 00:50:50,994
Couldn't I tape it?

815
00:50:51,070 --> 00:50:53,903
Ernesto, please, don't be such a pain.
Go away!

816
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:55,864
Bye.

817
00:51:01,013 --> 00:51:02,344
- Edurne...
- Yes?

818
00:51:02,882 --> 00:51:05,908
I'm going to speak to Lena. I
don't want to be interrupted.

819
00:51:06,085 --> 00:51:10,021
Don't worry, I'll see to it.
I'll be your watchdog.

820
00:51:30,643 --> 00:51:32,838
Wait! Is his son out there?

821
00:51:33,012 --> 00:51:34,980
No, I sent him home.

822
00:51:35,148 --> 00:51:36,615
Edurne's keeping watch.

823
00:51:41,988 --> 00:51:43,853
Mateo, this is crazy.

824
00:52:40,613 --> 00:52:41,637
Hello.

825
00:52:41,848 --> 00:52:42,906
Hello.

826
00:52:43,082 --> 00:52:44,276
What are you doing?

827
00:52:44,784 --> 00:52:45,978
Nothing.

828
00:52:46,986 --> 00:52:48,180
Waiting for you.

829
00:52:48,454 --> 00:52:51,014
I didn't think film making
was such hard work.

830
00:52:51,190 --> 00:52:55,559
Yes, it is. It doesn't stop.
It's very absorbing.

831
00:52:55,728 --> 00:52:57,355
Aren't you tired?

832
00:52:58,331 --> 00:53:00,231
Chocolate gives me energy.

833
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:03,291
I love bitter orange
with chocolate.

834
00:53:04,737 --> 00:53:07,035
I meant the shoot,
not the chocolate.

835
00:53:07,206 --> 00:53:08,332
Oh, very.

836
00:53:08,507 --> 00:53:11,704
At the end of the week, I'm
very tired, but I'm happy.

837
00:53:12,678 --> 00:53:14,873
I thought we could take a break,

838
00:53:15,047 --> 00:53:17,379
a weekend, just you and I,

839
00:53:17,917 --> 00:53:19,407
in the house on Ibiza.

840
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:22,881
We rehearse on weekends.

841
00:53:23,656 --> 00:53:25,624
Don't you rehearse
during the shoot?

842
00:53:25,691 --> 00:53:26,715
Yes.

843
00:53:26,993 --> 00:53:29,325
Do you spend the whole
day rehearsing?

844
00:53:29,962 --> 00:53:32,829
- That's how you make a film.
- What about other people?

845
00:53:32,999 --> 00:53:35,559
You can't just leave
them aside for months.

846
00:53:35,735 --> 00:53:37,828
The film sets the rules.

847
00:53:38,938 --> 00:53:41,998
No, I set them.
I'm the producer.

848
00:53:44,777 --> 00:53:46,335
- Is there a problem?
- Yes.

849
00:53:46,512 --> 00:53:48,537
It's completely impersonal.

850
00:53:48,614 --> 00:53:51,708
I asked for a graphic set,
but this is totally dead!

851
00:53:52,518 --> 00:53:55,282
- Shall I speak to Antxon?
- No, I'll do it.

852
00:53:56,389 --> 00:53:57,788
What's wrong with you?

853
00:53:57,957 --> 00:53:59,083
You look awful.

854
00:53:59,692 --> 00:54:00,852
It's Diego.

855
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:05,260
He could hardly breathe all night.
Neither of us got any sleep.

856
00:54:05,898 --> 00:54:07,593
You still don't know what it is?

857
00:54:08,034 --> 00:54:10,867
Some doctors say it's asthma,
others that he's allergic,

858
00:54:10,937 --> 00:54:12,632
but we don't know to what.

859
00:54:13,372 --> 00:54:15,101
They're still investigating,

860
00:54:15,975 --> 00:54:17,374
but we're desperate.

861
00:54:17,443 --> 00:54:19,775
Take all the time you need.

862
00:54:19,946 --> 00:54:22,210
Right now, your son
is what matters.

863
00:54:22,381 --> 00:54:23,473
Thank you.

864
00:54:26,385 --> 00:54:27,409
Another thing.

865
00:54:27,620 --> 00:54:30,020
- I was talking to the producer.
- And?

866
00:54:30,823 --> 00:54:33,348
He's complaining that Lena's
too absorbed by the shooting.

867
00:54:35,628 --> 00:54:37,323
How does he think
films are made?

868
00:54:38,698 --> 00:54:41,667
Ernesto is a businessman,
not an artist.

869
00:54:41,734 --> 00:54:44,294
No one asked him to
become a producer!

870
00:54:44,904 --> 00:54:46,963
It's too late to
argue about that.

871
00:54:50,843 --> 00:54:52,674
He's taking her to
Ibiza this weekend

872
00:54:52,979 --> 00:54:54,173
so you can't rehearse.

873
00:54:56,482 --> 00:54:57,506
Son of a bitch!

874
00:55:00,953 --> 00:55:03,183
Get rid of the lamps, the
table, the chairs...

875
00:55:03,356 --> 00:55:05,790
I wanted a graphic set,
but it should be alive.

876
00:57:00,606 --> 00:57:02,870
God, I look awful!

877
00:57:52,024 --> 00:57:54,049
You get scared when I touch you,

878
00:57:54,460 --> 00:57:57,224
but not when you see me dead?

879
00:57:58,063 --> 00:58:00,088
I didn't think you were dead.

880
00:58:00,599 --> 00:58:02,464
I thought you were asleep.

881
00:58:03,269 --> 00:58:04,896
I usually snore.

882
00:58:06,472 --> 00:58:09,908
If I'd thought you were dead, I
wouldn't have got made up for you.

883
00:58:10,876 --> 00:58:13,140
Any man of my age could
have a heart attack

884
00:58:13,212 --> 00:58:14,679
after screwing six times.

885
00:58:17,149 --> 00:58:19,049
You're not a man of your age.

886
00:58:24,390 --> 00:58:25,823
I wouldn't mind dying

887
00:58:26,392 --> 00:58:29,828
after fucking with you
for days, weeks, months,

888
00:58:29,995 --> 00:58:31,462
years, centuries.

889
00:58:33,399 --> 00:58:34,957
I'm crazy about you,

890
00:58:35,301 --> 00:58:36,791
you drive me crazy.

891
00:58:37,836 --> 00:58:39,565
I guess you know that.

892
00:58:40,739 --> 00:58:41,728
Yes.

893
00:58:42,641 --> 00:58:43,842
I think I do.

894
00:58:44,043 --> 00:58:45,305
Action!

895
00:58:47,980 --> 00:58:51,143
Look at what I found on the sidewalk.
They fell off your terrace.

896
00:58:51,317 --> 00:58:53,979
They were gifts from
Ivan, I threw them out.

897
00:58:54,220 --> 00:58:58,247
You can't do that, Miss Pina.
You could kill someone.

898
00:58:58,424 --> 00:59:02,224
In Naples, on New Year's Eve,
they even throw out furniture.

899
00:59:02,394 --> 00:59:05,557
My grandpa was Neapolitan,
and it's in my blood.

900
00:59:05,731 --> 00:59:08,894
But this isn't Naples and
today isn't New Year's Eve.

901
00:59:10,603 --> 00:59:13,663
I was nervous, throwing things
out relaxes me. You keep them.

902
00:59:14,173 --> 00:59:15,731
They'll come in handy.

903
00:59:17,042 --> 00:59:18,236
"Love."

904
00:59:19,111 --> 00:59:22,012
You say "love," I say "sex."

905
00:59:22,615 --> 00:59:23,673
Cut!

906
00:59:24,116 --> 00:59:26,175
- Shall we print it?
- Like hell!

907
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:29,053
I'll fix your make-up
after, okay?

908
00:59:35,861 --> 00:59:37,852
You're not on form today.

909
00:59:38,364 --> 00:59:39,422
I know.

910
00:59:40,232 --> 00:59:41,221
What's wrong?

911
00:59:41,634 --> 00:59:43,158
I'll tell you later.

912
00:59:44,903 --> 00:59:46,871
- We'll have a sandwich break.
- 30 minutes?

913
00:59:46,939 --> 00:59:47,963
Yeah.

914
00:59:48,173 --> 00:59:50,334
We'll take a 30 minute
sandwich break.

915
00:59:50,409 --> 00:59:53,435
Let's clear this a
bit and go outside.

916
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:08,920
No lips.

917
01:00:12,331 --> 01:00:14,891
"I've had a horrible weekend."

918
01:00:15,267 --> 01:00:18,395
"But we didn't rehearse
so that you could rest."

919
01:00:18,570 --> 01:00:19,764
"Rest?"

920
01:00:19,905 --> 01:00:23,739
"I had that son of a bitch
on top of me for 48 hours."

921
01:00:23,909 --> 01:00:26,070
"He didn't let up for a second."

922
01:00:26,245 --> 01:00:27,576
"The bastard."

923
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:29,672
"I'm living on tranks."

924
01:00:31,183 --> 01:00:32,343
No lips.

925
01:00:35,521 --> 01:00:38,684
"No, no. I'll get over
it and I'll do it."

926
01:00:38,857 --> 01:00:39,915
"Are you sure?"

927
01:00:39,992 --> 01:00:41,016
"Yes."

928
01:00:41,126 --> 01:00:44,186
"You have to be
witty and light."

929
01:00:45,698 --> 01:00:46,858
"Of course."

930
01:00:47,032 --> 01:00:48,363
"Light."

931
01:00:48,534 --> 01:00:49,796
"Light."

932
01:00:52,805 --> 01:00:54,636
You don't know what it's like

933
01:00:54,807 --> 01:00:57,799
having that monster on
top of you for 48 hours.

934
01:00:57,976 --> 01:00:59,273
It makes me sick.

935
01:01:01,046 --> 01:01:03,105
"It's best if you don't
think about it."

936
01:01:03,282 --> 01:01:06,251
"It's best if you and I
never talk about Ernesto."

937
01:01:06,418 --> 01:01:09,444
"It's best not to open
that can of worms."

938
01:01:12,891 --> 01:01:14,984
What do you do with
your notebooks?

939
01:01:16,362 --> 01:01:17,488
I fill them.

940
01:01:17,830 --> 01:01:18,819
And then?

941
01:01:19,198 --> 01:01:20,222
I burn them.

942
01:01:20,299 --> 01:01:22,665
I'd rather the
notebooks slept here.

943
01:01:23,802 --> 01:01:24,860
Slept?

944
01:01:24,937 --> 01:01:28,031
Leave them here. You'll
get them back tomorrow.

945
01:01:29,408 --> 01:01:31,205
When you finish, I'll keep them.

946
01:01:31,543 --> 01:01:33,340
Very well. Whatever you say.

947
01:01:37,116 --> 01:01:38,242
What time tomorrow?

948
01:01:38,317 --> 01:01:40,285
I'll call you when the
material is ready.

949
01:01:41,587 --> 01:01:45,318
I presume you are aware of the total
confidentiality of your work.

950
01:01:45,491 --> 01:01:46,583
Of course.

951
01:01:46,759 --> 01:01:47,851
Goodbye.

952
01:02:05,177 --> 01:02:06,371
Hello, Lena.

953
01:02:07,012 --> 01:02:08,036
Hi.

954
01:02:09,047 --> 01:02:11,811
My father was asking why I
don't go with you to yoga.

955
01:02:11,984 --> 01:02:15,545
- He always asks.
- Tell him that I'm grown up and free,

956
01:02:15,721 --> 01:02:17,780
and that I've forbidden
you to follow me.

957
01:02:17,956 --> 01:02:19,548
I can't tell him that.

958
01:02:19,725 --> 01:02:21,522
Try it. It would do you good.

959
01:02:21,693 --> 01:02:22,887
I can't.

960
01:02:23,028 --> 01:02:25,690
Do what you like, but
don't come with me.

961
01:02:25,864 --> 01:02:27,422
You're such a pain!

962
01:03:24,223 --> 01:03:25,747
What are you doing?

963
01:03:26,558 --> 01:03:27,718
Working.

964
01:03:28,660 --> 01:03:32,494
Turn that off! Didn't Mateo forbid
you to tape us off the shoot?

965
01:03:32,664 --> 01:03:35,827
My father told me to ignore that.
He wants to see everything.

966
01:03:36,668 --> 01:03:38,636
Neither of you has any scruples!

967
01:03:38,804 --> 01:03:40,465
Fucking leave me alone!

968
01:03:41,006 --> 01:03:42,530
Remember I'm taping you.

969
01:03:43,475 --> 01:03:45,238
Stop, I said.

970
01:03:46,445 --> 01:03:47,639
Stop!

971
01:03:48,714 --> 01:03:51,444
I told you to stop! Give
me the fucking camera!

972
01:03:51,617 --> 01:03:54,245
- You're crazy!
- Just leave me alone!

973
01:03:54,419 --> 01:03:55,716
Let go! My camera!

974
01:04:18,744 --> 01:04:20,041
Focus on me!

975
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:29,309
Ernesto,

976
01:04:29,388 --> 01:04:31,015
listen carefully.

977
01:04:31,423 --> 01:04:33,152
Yes, I'm talking to you.

978
01:04:34,259 --> 01:04:36,056
I've just been with
the man I love

979
01:04:37,195 --> 01:04:39,686
and I'm happier
than I've ever been

980
01:04:40,566 --> 01:04:42,329
because that man loves me too,

981
01:04:42,834 --> 01:04:43,858
a lot.

982
01:04:45,137 --> 01:04:47,970
Don't worry, I'll leave
you in peace very soon.

983
01:04:48,740 --> 01:04:50,674
You needn't spy on us anymore.

984
01:04:52,578 --> 01:04:54,273
There's nothing to hide now.

985
01:06:20,232 --> 01:06:23,326
I don't know if you got back a
little late or a little early.

986
01:06:23,969 --> 01:06:27,268
- It was raining, we couldn't shoot.
- Where are you going?

987
01:06:29,107 --> 01:06:30,267
I'm leaving you.

988
01:06:30,976 --> 01:06:32,443
Shouldn't we talk first?

989
01:06:32,611 --> 01:06:34,579
I've said all I had
to say to you.

990
01:06:34,746 --> 01:06:36,577
Lena, please!

991
01:06:37,049 --> 01:06:38,073
Please, Lena!

992
01:06:38,150 --> 01:06:39,174
Goodbye.

993
01:06:40,252 --> 01:06:41,583
Listen to me.

994
01:06:41,753 --> 01:06:42,913
Let go.

995
01:07:22,027 --> 01:07:24,723
Turn over, my love.
I'll help you.

996
01:07:25,630 --> 01:07:26,961
Let me do it.

997
01:07:28,166 --> 01:07:30,396
Relax, I'll help you.

998
01:07:32,471 --> 01:07:35,963
You could have broken something.
I'll take off your shoes.

999
01:07:40,479 --> 01:07:42,470
You'll be more comfortable.

1000
01:07:43,915 --> 01:07:46,076
I'll see to everything. Come on!

1001
01:07:47,786 --> 01:07:49,151
Help me.

1002
01:08:12,477 --> 01:08:14,707
My love, be careful.

1003
01:08:18,250 --> 01:08:20,548
Sit down, but be careful.

1004
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:23,182
My darling.

1005
01:08:24,089 --> 01:08:25,420
That's it.

1006
01:08:25,590 --> 01:08:27,615
I'll take you to the hospital.

1007
01:09:03,628 --> 01:09:05,596
My wife fell down the stairs.

1008
01:09:05,764 --> 01:09:07,061
Be very careful, please.

1009
01:09:07,999 --> 01:09:09,796
Let's see, be careful.

1010
01:09:11,236 --> 01:09:12,498
Her head.

1011
01:09:15,907 --> 01:09:18,239
Easy does it.

1012
01:09:18,410 --> 01:09:20,275
Be careful with my legs.

1013
01:09:23,448 --> 01:09:24,813
Take her to Trauma.

1014
01:10:07,893 --> 01:10:09,121
Can I make a call?

1015
01:10:09,294 --> 01:10:11,091
Not in here. In the
doctor's office.

1016
01:10:11,263 --> 01:10:14,494
- It's urgent.
- We'll take you there right away.

1017
01:10:17,302 --> 01:10:18,394
Mateo?

1018
01:10:18,570 --> 01:10:19,594
Yes.

1019
01:10:19,905 --> 01:10:21,668
What's wrong? Aren't you coming?

1020
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:23,239
No, not tonight.

1021
01:10:23,508 --> 01:10:24,702
Has something happened?

1022
01:10:26,811 --> 01:10:28,472
Something came up unexpectedly,

1023
01:10:28,914 --> 01:10:31,178
but don't worry,
everything's fine.

1024
01:10:31,683 --> 01:10:34,743
Tomorrow it's an evening shoot.
Shall I see you before?

1025
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:37,388
No, I can't make it.

1026
01:10:37,555 --> 01:10:40,046
I've got a lot to do. I'll
see you at the studio.

1027
01:10:40,225 --> 01:10:43,752
You sound odd. There's
really nothing wrong?

1028
01:10:43,929 --> 01:10:44,953
No.

1029
01:10:46,264 --> 01:10:48,266
I'll see you tomorrow.

1030
01:10:52,270 --> 01:10:54,761
There they are.
Ask no questions.

1031
01:11:03,815 --> 01:11:05,180
How are you, ma'am?

1032
01:11:05,350 --> 01:11:06,374
Fine.

1033
01:11:06,551 --> 01:11:07,609
Can I help you?

1034
01:11:07,786 --> 01:11:09,344
No, I'm all right, thank you.

1035
01:11:09,521 --> 01:11:10,715
It was nothing.

1036
01:11:11,289 --> 01:11:14,315
You go on ahead and
open the door.

1037
01:11:24,235 --> 01:11:26,294
Thank you for your discretion.

1038
01:11:29,641 --> 01:11:32,075
Can you take off your
glasses, please?

1039
01:11:42,387 --> 01:11:43,877
What should I do?

1040
01:11:44,656 --> 01:11:46,419
What can I do so
you'll forgive me?

1041
01:11:46,591 --> 01:11:47,853
Take me to the studio.

1042
01:11:48,593 --> 01:11:49,855
You shouldn't move.

1043
01:11:49,928 --> 01:11:52,761
If you don't, I'll drag
myself there if I have to.

1044
01:11:52,931 --> 01:11:54,330
What'll you say?

1045
01:11:54,866 --> 01:11:57,699
How will you explain the
cast and the bruises?

1046
01:11:58,236 --> 01:11:59,601
It depends on you.

1047
01:11:59,771 --> 01:12:00,897
On me?

1048
01:12:05,210 --> 01:12:08,839
I'll do what you want if you
promise to stay with me.

1049
01:12:12,283 --> 01:12:13,841
I'll stay with you

1050
01:12:14,452 --> 01:12:18,479
if you let Mateo finish the
film however he wishes.

1051
01:12:18,656 --> 01:12:20,988
He'll interrogate
you, he isn't stupid.

1052
01:12:21,993 --> 01:12:23,153
I'll say I tripped.

1053
01:12:25,263 --> 01:12:27,094
How can you work
if you can't walk?

1054
01:12:27,766 --> 01:12:29,358
He'll decide that,

1055
01:12:29,534 --> 01:12:32,162
but I want to be sure you'll
respect his decision,

1056
01:12:32,771 --> 01:12:35,706
no matter what it costs
or the time it takes.

1057
01:12:36,241 --> 01:12:37,230
Understood?

1058
01:12:58,096 --> 01:12:59,495
I live there.

1059
01:13:10,008 --> 01:13:11,339
That's everything.

1060
01:13:11,509 --> 01:13:13,875
Ernesto will back
whatever you decide.

1061
01:13:14,045 --> 01:13:15,103
Decide what?

1062
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:17,874
I can't go from a shot
of you walking normally

1063
01:13:18,049 --> 01:13:19,607
to one of you in a cast!

1064
01:13:20,718 --> 01:13:22,618
When can you take it off?

1065
01:13:22,787 --> 01:13:23,811
In three weeks.

1066
01:13:25,824 --> 01:13:27,985
May I speak to Lena alone?

1067
01:13:45,777 --> 01:13:46,801
Tell me the truth.

1068
01:13:48,713 --> 01:13:50,806
People don't fall down stairs.

1069
01:13:51,483 --> 01:13:53,144
That only happens in films.

1070
01:13:53,318 --> 01:13:54,785
Keep your voice down!

1071
01:13:55,320 --> 01:13:57,652
We have to finish shooting
as soon as we can.

1072
01:13:57,822 --> 01:14:00,052
- Until then I can't leave Ernesto.
- Why?

1073
01:14:00,225 --> 01:14:02,750
He's a psychopath. What
more proof do you need?

1074
01:14:05,330 --> 01:14:06,490
My God!

1075
01:14:17,742 --> 01:14:19,073
I can't leave!

1076
01:14:19,244 --> 01:14:22,702
I promised to stay with him if
he lets you finish the film

1077
01:14:22,881 --> 01:14:24,781
under your conditions.

1078
01:14:27,018 --> 01:14:29,179
There must be another solution.

1079
01:14:29,554 --> 01:14:30,543
What is it?

1080
01:14:30,722 --> 01:14:33,850
The only solution is that I stay
with him until you're finished.

1081
01:14:34,025 --> 01:14:36,118
What have you promised exactly?

1082
01:14:36,294 --> 01:14:38,091
To live under the same roof,

1083
01:14:38,263 --> 01:14:40,925
in separate bedrooms.

1084
01:14:41,099 --> 01:14:42,361
He's got no rights.

1085
01:14:42,534 --> 01:14:44,695
Do you think he'll accept that?

1086
01:14:45,703 --> 01:14:47,000
I don't know,

1087
01:14:47,071 --> 01:14:49,471
but the sooner we
finish the better.

1088
01:14:50,175 --> 01:14:52,143
We mustn't stop now!

1089
01:14:56,281 --> 01:14:58,442
We just have one
scene on the stairs.

1090
01:15:00,318 --> 01:15:02,149
We'd have to repeat the ending.

1091
01:15:03,888 --> 01:15:06,379
Retake 23. One, first.

1092
01:15:09,427 --> 01:15:10,587
Action!

1093
01:15:15,934 --> 01:15:18,266
So you're Ivan's ex-wife,

1094
01:15:18,436 --> 01:15:21,428
the one who's been in a
mental hospital for 20 years.

1095
01:15:24,509 --> 01:15:27,137
Yes, but I'm not in a
mental hospital now.

1096
01:15:27,779 --> 01:15:29,337
I'm here with you,

1097
01:15:30,148 --> 01:15:31,945
going down the stairs.

1098
01:15:32,817 --> 01:15:35,615
From the note, it seems
you're anxious to see him.

1099
01:15:36,454 --> 01:15:38,183
Yes, but you go first.

1100
01:15:39,290 --> 01:15:43,249
You're the one in a hurry.
I've been waiting 20 years.

1101
01:15:44,696 --> 01:15:45,685
Go on.

1102
01:15:56,741 --> 01:15:58,402
<i>As I was saying,</i>

1103
01:15:59,077 --> 01:16:01,443
<i>after I split up with my husband
I went out on the street</i>

1104
01:16:01,512 --> 01:16:05,073
<i>and there was a guy
eyeing me, good-looking,</i>

1105
01:16:05,149 --> 01:16:06,173
<i>his ass...</i>

1106
01:16:06,351 --> 01:16:07,818
<i>His feet...</i>

1107
01:16:08,453 --> 01:16:11,081
<i>I brought him home and
screwed him several times.</i>

1108
01:16:11,155 --> 01:16:14,386
<i>I'm very interested in
sex as a social matter.</i>

1109
01:16:15,260 --> 01:16:16,557
<i>- How was it?
- In bed?</i>

1110
01:16:16,728 --> 01:16:20,186
<i>Divine, a virtuoso. I've
never seen anything like it.</i>

1111
01:16:20,365 --> 01:16:21,662
This is the good take.

1112
01:16:21,833 --> 01:16:23,494
<i>His big toe!</i>

1113
01:16:25,670 --> 01:16:28,503
<i>Every morning, Lena arrived
at the shoot exhausted.</i>

1114
01:16:29,574 --> 01:16:31,269
<i>By sheer repetition,</i>

1115
01:16:31,442 --> 01:16:34,741
<i>there was always a take in which
she managed to do it well.</i>

1116
01:16:35,580 --> 01:16:38,606
<i>Living with Martel
had become hell.</i>

1117
01:16:39,183 --> 01:16:41,947
<i>Lena didn't say anything,
but it was obvious.</i>

1118
01:16:42,453 --> 01:16:45,183
<i>When shooting finished I
begged her to leave him,</i>

1119
01:16:45,356 --> 01:16:47,119
<i>but she was scared for the film.</i>

1120
01:16:48,459 --> 01:16:50,154
<i>She didn't want to leave him</i>

1121
01:16:50,328 --> 01:16:52,990
<i>at least until I'd chosen
all the good takes.</i>

1122
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:56,624
Yes?

1123
01:16:56,701 --> 01:16:58,999
<i>- It's Magdalena.
- ls anything wrong?</i>

1124
01:16:59,070 --> 01:17:02,335
<i>No, I'm down below. I've
got no money for the taxi.</i>

1125
01:17:02,407 --> 01:17:03,704
I'm coming down.

1126
01:17:05,043 --> 01:17:06,101
I'll be right back.

1127
01:17:26,264 --> 01:17:27,731
She's in the washroom.

1128
01:17:37,175 --> 01:17:38,369
What happened?

1129
01:17:41,179 --> 01:17:42,908
We had a terrible fight.

1130
01:17:43,748 --> 01:17:47,047
He tore off my clothes and
threw me out on the road.

1131
01:17:48,720 --> 01:17:53,214
Give the taxi driver a tip. He
lent me his jacket, otherwise...

1132
01:17:54,359 --> 01:17:55,758
Son of a bitch!

1133
01:17:55,927 --> 01:17:58,361
We'll report him to
the police right now.

1134
01:18:00,498 --> 01:18:03,194
Take me far away
from here, please.

1135
01:18:03,501 --> 01:18:06,493
Yes, of course.
Whatever you want.

1136
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:43,937
Give me the camera.

1137
01:19:28,453 --> 01:19:29,750
What are you writing?

1138
01:19:31,589 --> 01:19:33,454
The secret of Golfo Beach.

1139
01:19:34,625 --> 01:19:37,594
When I took the photo I didn't
see the couple kissing.

1140
01:19:38,796 --> 01:19:40,457
And what's the secret?

1141
01:19:41,098 --> 01:19:44,966
I don't know. I have to
write it to find out.

1142
01:19:48,606 --> 01:19:50,267
We're that couple.

1143
01:20:15,633 --> 01:20:18,796
Two people, just
like when they died.

1144
01:20:18,903 --> 01:20:20,097
A man and a woman.

1145
01:20:20,238 --> 01:20:23,332
They died together.

1146
01:21:02,313 --> 01:21:04,440
Before we knew, a
month had passed.

1147
01:21:04,615 --> 01:21:07,482
I knew that sooner or later
we'd have to go back,

1148
01:21:07,652 --> 01:21:09,347
but we kept putting it off.

1149
01:21:10,021 --> 01:21:12,182
I was only worried about
your mother and you.

1150
01:21:12,356 --> 01:21:14,790
I hadn't even said
goodbye to you,

1151
01:21:14,959 --> 01:21:17,826
and you had all those
allergies when we left.

1152
01:21:57,902 --> 01:22:00,063
OPENING SOON

1153
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:04,701
GIRLS AND SUITCASES

1154
01:22:16,454 --> 01:22:18,752
I was wondering
when he'd turn up.

1155
01:22:18,923 --> 01:22:21,892
But they can't open the
film so soon, can they?

1156
01:22:22,059 --> 01:22:24,857
He's doing it to annoy us. It's
a trick so you'll go back.

1157
01:22:24,929 --> 01:22:27,261
All the ad needed was
the word "Wanted".

1158
01:22:27,665 --> 01:22:28,996
What'll we do?

1159
01:22:29,233 --> 01:22:31,360
Nothing. Screw him!

1160
01:22:44,548 --> 01:22:45,879
PREMIERE TONIGHT

1161
01:22:46,817 --> 01:22:48,341
DISASTER

1162
01:23:20,785 --> 01:23:21,843
What does it say?

1163
01:23:24,121 --> 01:23:27,784
That the only intelligent thing we
did was not to go to the premiere.

1164
01:23:28,626 --> 01:23:30,150
Bastards!

1165
01:23:43,774 --> 01:23:45,036
<i>Judit?</i>

1166
01:23:46,077 --> 01:23:49,911
<i>It's me. I have to
speak to you urgently.</i>

1167
01:23:50,614 --> 01:23:52,081
Call me, please.

1168
01:23:53,250 --> 01:23:54,774
I'll give you the number.

1169
01:23:55,653 --> 01:23:57,518
845132...

1170
01:23:57,588 --> 01:23:58,680
28...

1171
01:23:58,789 --> 01:24:02,452
Sorry, 28845132.

1172
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:07,021
And ask for Harry Caine. I'm
registered under that name.

1173
01:24:08,599 --> 01:24:09,623
Are you there?

1174
01:24:12,703 --> 01:24:14,295
<i>I'll be expecting your call.</i>

1175
01:24:15,539 --> 01:24:16,904
Mom didn't call back?

1176
01:24:17,074 --> 01:24:18,098
No.

1177
01:24:18,576 --> 01:24:19,702
Why?

1178
01:24:22,413 --> 01:24:23,971
She was angry, I guess.

1179
01:24:25,516 --> 01:24:29,509
Even so, she should've told
you what was happening.

1180
01:24:31,756 --> 01:24:34,816
But she didn't, and we've
never talked about it.

1181
01:24:37,428 --> 01:24:39,225
Weren't you curious?

1182
01:24:39,396 --> 01:24:41,990
Me? I was dying of curiosity!

1183
01:24:42,166 --> 01:24:45,795
For two days I kept calling
your mother and the editor,

1184
01:24:45,970 --> 01:24:47,460
but neither answered.

1185
01:24:49,173 --> 01:24:51,164
So I decided to
go back to Madrid

1186
01:24:51,342 --> 01:24:53,936
and see with my own eyes
what was happening.

1187
01:24:58,849 --> 01:25:01,079
It's the first time
we've been apart.

1188
01:25:02,353 --> 01:25:04,583
I'll be back at the weekend.

1189
01:25:06,624 --> 01:25:09,115
But if you're worried,
come with me.

1190
01:25:09,727 --> 01:25:11,422
No, I'm better off here.

1191
01:25:12,863 --> 01:25:14,455
Madrid scares me.

1192
01:26:27,338 --> 01:26:30,796
<i>Magdalena's death didn't surprise
us locked in an embrace,</i>

1193
01:26:30,975 --> 01:26:32,408
<i>as we'd dreamed,</i>

1194
01:26:32,843 --> 01:26:35,437
<i>but sitting in separate seats.</i>

1195
01:26:36,714 --> 01:26:38,978
<i>It even surprised me
by leaving me alive.</i>

1196
01:26:44,355 --> 01:26:45,720
Say something.

1197
01:26:47,825 --> 01:26:49,884
Mateo is dead.

1198
01:26:52,029 --> 01:26:53,826
Don't say that.

1199
01:26:53,998 --> 01:26:57,434
We address him by his name,
but he refuses to answer.

1200
01:26:57,601 --> 01:26:59,193
He insists that Mateo is dead.

1201
01:27:01,472 --> 01:27:04,032
His work revolves around images.

1202
01:27:05,643 --> 01:27:09,374
I guess that for him living
in the dark is death.

1203
01:27:12,650 --> 01:27:15,778
- Is there any chance that he'll see?
- None.

1204
01:27:16,654 --> 01:27:19,623
He has what we call
cortical blindness

1205
01:27:19,790 --> 01:27:21,121
and it's irreversible.

1206
01:27:23,560 --> 01:27:25,027
That's very good,

1207
01:27:25,996 --> 01:27:27,156
very good.

1208
01:27:30,467 --> 01:27:32,731
There are some steps
to the right.

1209
01:27:35,506 --> 01:27:36,632
But not here.

1210
01:27:36,807 --> 01:27:38,900
You have to go
forward a bit more.

1211
01:27:40,911 --> 01:27:43,379
I'll guide you until
we reach the edge.

1212
01:27:44,415 --> 01:27:45,404
Come on.

1213
01:27:46,951 --> 01:27:48,578
That's it.

1214
01:27:50,654 --> 01:27:52,144
We're almost there.

1215
01:27:55,492 --> 01:27:58,256
Now there are a few
steps down to the car.

1216
01:27:58,429 --> 01:28:01,626
We'll take them carefully,
they're very high.

1217
01:28:01,799 --> 01:28:04,290
They're 10 inches, I
measured them earlier.

1218
01:28:04,468 --> 01:28:06,459
Wait, I'll put down your bag.

1219
01:28:08,339 --> 01:28:09,431
Come on.

1220
01:28:13,811 --> 01:28:17,144
The first is the hardest,

1221
01:28:17,581 --> 01:28:19,139
but I'm holding on to you.

1222
01:28:24,188 --> 01:28:26,156
Yes, slide your feet along.

1223
01:28:27,157 --> 01:28:29,625
That's it, let's go.

1224
01:28:34,465 --> 01:28:35,693
Very good.

1225
01:28:36,367 --> 01:28:37,391
Come on.

1226
01:28:37,468 --> 01:28:39,368
Now, the second one.
That's right.

1227
01:28:44,008 --> 01:28:45,441
A little more.

1228
01:28:45,676 --> 01:28:46,836
There.

1229
01:28:47,878 --> 01:28:49,539
That's it, no more steps.

1230
01:28:50,781 --> 01:28:53,375
Did you go to see Lena's
mother in the village?

1231
01:28:54,051 --> 01:28:55,075
Yes.

1232
01:28:56,053 --> 01:28:57,418
What did she say?

1233
01:29:00,257 --> 01:29:04,057
She was very grateful to Ernesto
for taking care of everything.

1234
01:29:08,499 --> 01:29:10,490
- Is she there?
- Yes.

1235
01:29:11,168 --> 01:29:13,329
They buried her with her father.

1236
01:29:14,438 --> 01:29:16,303
Did you see the grave?

1237
01:29:17,674 --> 01:29:18,698
Yes.

1238
01:29:21,145 --> 01:29:22,271
What's it like?

1239
01:29:25,115 --> 01:29:26,309
Simple.

1240
01:29:26,750 --> 01:29:29,150
Her mother didn't
want anything fancy.

1241
01:29:39,530 --> 01:29:41,293
Look, mom, the sea!

1242
01:29:43,400 --> 01:29:44,992
We're in Famara.

1243
01:29:45,836 --> 01:29:48,304
Stop, please. I'll get out here.

1244
01:29:48,472 --> 01:29:51,305
No, wait a minute.
How can you get out?

1245
01:29:52,376 --> 01:29:55,106
Go to Reception and do
what you have to do.

1246
01:29:56,113 --> 01:29:57,944
I'll wait for you on the beach.

1247
01:29:58,115 --> 01:30:01,744
- I want to get out here too.
- How can you get out in this wind?

1248
01:30:01,919 --> 01:30:04,945
- I don't mind the wind.
- Be quiet, Diego.

1249
01:30:08,292 --> 01:30:09,589
Stop the car, please.

1250
01:30:23,740 --> 01:30:26,834
Mom, please, let me stay.

1251
01:30:26,910 --> 01:30:29,276
It's the first time
I've seen the sea.

1252
01:30:29,446 --> 01:30:31,107
- Please.
- All right.

1253
01:30:31,615 --> 01:30:33,242
- Wrap up well.
- Okay.

1254
01:30:33,417 --> 01:30:36,215
And don't go to near the water.
Give him your hand.

1255
01:30:36,753 --> 01:30:38,744
Don't let go of him, please.

1256
01:30:39,356 --> 01:30:41,381
You wrap up, too.

1257
01:30:42,926 --> 01:30:44,951
Oh, Lord.

1258
01:30:46,096 --> 01:30:47,290
That's it.

1259
01:30:50,167 --> 01:30:52,829
Careful, there's a step.

1260
01:31:03,113 --> 01:31:04,375
Let's go.

1261
01:31:14,324 --> 01:31:15,814
Wait here, please.

1262
01:31:29,239 --> 01:31:30,729
Good morning.

1263
01:33:34,298 --> 01:33:35,458
Harry!

1264
01:33:36,500 --> 01:33:37,524
Harry Caine!

1265
01:33:40,737 --> 01:33:42,796
We're here!

1266
01:33:54,217 --> 01:33:56,208
We have to go, Harry.

1267
01:33:57,054 --> 01:33:58,988
Come on, Diego.

1268
01:34:00,057 --> 01:34:01,649
Give me your hand.

1269
01:34:04,361 --> 01:34:06,420
Can't we stay a bit longer?

1270
01:34:06,596 --> 01:34:08,826
No, you have to
obey your mother.

1271
01:34:09,032 --> 01:34:10,932
You've had enough
wind for today.

1272
01:34:16,006 --> 01:34:17,473
I'm here, Harry.

1273
01:34:18,642 --> 01:34:20,667
Careful you don't trip.

1274
01:34:35,892 --> 01:34:37,689
Do you remember Famara?

1275
01:34:39,229 --> 01:34:42,357
Perfectly. It was the
first time I saw the sea.

1276
01:34:43,500 --> 01:34:46,469
I remember the kites and
a dog that was barking.

1277
01:34:49,072 --> 01:34:51,734
I remember the dog barking, too.

1278
01:35:01,318 --> 01:35:02,444
What are you doing?

1279
01:35:03,086 --> 01:35:05,782
I'm trying to reconstruct
some of your photos.

1280
01:35:24,074 --> 01:35:26,201
I've got one that's
almost complete.

1281
01:35:30,180 --> 01:35:31,875
What do you want to
see to cheer you up?

1282
01:35:32,416 --> 01:35:34,145
I'd like to hear
Jeanne Moreau's voice.

1283
01:35:34,518 --> 01:35:35,951
I don't have her number.

1284
01:35:36,253 --> 01:35:38,847
<i>Look for Elevator to the
Gallows, by Louis Malle.</i>

1285
01:35:39,389 --> 01:35:40,378
Okay.

1286
01:35:40,457 --> 01:35:42,186
Fritz Lang,

1287
01:35:42,292 --> 01:35:44,351
Jules Dassin, Nicholas Ray...

1288
01:35:44,528 --> 01:35:45,893
Look up above.

1289
01:35:48,632 --> 01:35:51,100
<i>Fanny and Alexander,
Eight and a Half,</i>

1290
01:35:51,268 --> 01:35:52,599
<i>Magnificent Obsession,</i>

1291
01:35:52,769 --> 01:35:55,033
<i>Elevator... Here it is.</i>

1292
01:35:55,305 --> 01:35:56,670
I've never seen it.

1293
01:35:56,940 --> 01:35:58,567
I hope you like it.

1294
01:36:03,046 --> 01:36:04,604
<i>How can I throw it out?</i>

1295
01:36:05,382 --> 01:36:07,509
<i>The police have to find it...</i>

1296
01:36:07,684 --> 01:36:10,152
<i>Leave that! It's
Girls and Suitcases.</i>

1297
01:36:10,787 --> 01:36:12,277
<i>I don't understand.</i>

1298
01:36:13,557 --> 01:36:14,888
<i>It's obvious, babe!</i>

1299
01:36:15,725 --> 01:36:19,957
<i>If the police find 30 pounds
of uncut cocaine in my house,</i>

1300
01:36:20,030 --> 01:36:21,429
<i>they could arrest me.</i>

1301
01:36:22,332 --> 01:36:26,098
<i>But I don't understand how that
suitcase appeared in your house,</i>

1302
01:36:26,269 --> 01:36:27,964
<i>like that, all of a sudden.</i>

1303
01:36:29,606 --> 01:36:31,164
Doesn't it sound odd?

1304
01:36:35,479 --> 01:36:40,109
<i>As I was saying, after I
split up with my husband</i>

1305
01:36:40,183 --> 01:36:43,675
<i>I went out on the street and
there was a guy eyeing me,</i>

1306
01:36:43,753 --> 01:36:46,984
<i>good-looking, his ass...
His feet...</i>

1307
01:36:48,458 --> 01:36:50,688
<i>I brought him home and
screwed him several times.</i>

1308
01:36:50,861 --> 01:36:52,726
They're completely off key.

1309
01:36:53,063 --> 01:36:55,896
<i>In bed? A virtuoso.</i>

1310
01:36:56,867 --> 01:36:58,732
<i>Look, my hairs are
standing on end.</i>

1311
01:36:58,869 --> 01:37:02,498
How could I have chosen those takes?
They're both terrible.

1312
01:37:05,742 --> 01:37:07,369
What do you want to do today?

1313
01:37:08,378 --> 01:37:09,538
I have to go home.

1314
01:37:10,347 --> 01:37:13,009
Mom left a message that
she's coming back today,

1315
01:37:13,183 --> 01:37:14,741
to celebrate your birthday.

1316
01:37:16,386 --> 01:37:17,410
It's my birthday?

1317
01:37:18,622 --> 01:37:19,782
That's what she says.

1318
01:37:20,390 --> 01:37:21,550
If Judit says so...

1319
01:37:22,792 --> 01:37:23,850
Happy birthday!

1320
01:37:24,427 --> 01:37:26,418
I'll have to take
you out to dinner.

1321
01:37:32,369 --> 01:37:33,961
Anyone at home?

1322
01:37:36,606 --> 01:37:37,732
Yes.

1323
01:37:37,908 --> 01:37:39,569
Love,

1324
01:37:40,243 --> 01:37:41,870
I was dying to see you!

1325
01:37:45,549 --> 01:37:46,743
What's up?

1326
01:37:47,117 --> 01:37:48,550
Do they show a lot?

1327
01:37:48,885 --> 01:37:49,874
Yeah.

1328
01:37:50,053 --> 01:37:52,544
Today I didn't even have
time to wipe my ass.

1329
01:37:53,623 --> 01:37:57,081
Don't look at me like that. I
thought you'd be used to it.

1330
01:37:57,561 --> 01:37:58,721
Yes, I'm sorry.

1331
01:37:59,796 --> 01:38:01,821
You're so handsome!

1332
01:38:02,933 --> 01:38:05,458
Are you all right? I
was worried about you.

1333
01:38:06,002 --> 01:38:07,162
I'm fine.

1334
01:38:07,337 --> 01:38:09,328
Mateo looked after
me day and night.

1335
01:38:09,506 --> 01:38:10,495
Mateo?

1336
01:38:11,374 --> 01:38:13,205
Don't you call him
Harry anymore?

1337
01:38:13,944 --> 01:38:15,036
Yes.

1338
01:38:17,547 --> 01:38:20,072
We have to buy him a
birthday present.

1339
01:38:22,619 --> 01:38:25,053
What have you been
doing all this time?

1340
01:38:25,221 --> 01:38:26,381
Nothing.

1341
01:38:26,556 --> 01:38:27,887
Watching films

1342
01:38:28,058 --> 01:38:29,047
and talking.

1343
01:38:30,226 --> 01:38:31,250
Talking?

1344
01:38:31,861 --> 01:38:32,850
Yes.

1345
01:38:32,929 --> 01:38:33,953
About what?

1346
01:38:34,731 --> 01:38:36,221
Mom, for God's sake!

1347
01:38:43,139 --> 01:38:44,902
And what was wrong with you?

1348
01:38:45,075 --> 01:38:47,600
I don't know if I believe
the gastroenteritis.

1349
01:38:47,777 --> 01:38:50,041
You used it as an
excuse in a script.

1350
01:38:50,213 --> 01:38:53,705
I had an accident, but I'd
rather not talk about it now.

1351
01:38:54,684 --> 01:38:56,117
An accident?

1352
01:38:56,686 --> 01:38:58,449
What kind of accident?

1353
01:38:59,356 --> 01:39:00,823
It's hard to explain.

1354
01:39:00,991 --> 01:39:02,788
Try it, I'm not so dumb.

1355
01:39:03,226 --> 01:39:05,888
We'll leave it for another day.
I'm fine now.

1356
01:39:07,864 --> 01:39:10,298
I'm going to buy
some DVDs for Mateo.

1357
01:39:46,670 --> 01:39:49,867
I don't know what you've
talked about all these days,

1358
01:39:51,875 --> 01:39:55,003
but I do know what I haven't
told you in all these years.

1359
01:39:55,745 --> 01:39:57,474
I never asked you.

1360
01:39:58,081 --> 01:40:00,709
But you'll have asked
yourself a thousand times.

1361
01:40:01,818 --> 01:40:04,048
This is your birthday present.

1362
01:40:05,755 --> 01:40:07,723
It's for you too, Diego.

1363
01:40:13,196 --> 01:40:14,925
After you two disappeared,

1364
01:40:15,432 --> 01:40:17,366
Ernesto Senior only
wanted revenge.

1365
01:40:17,534 --> 01:40:19,434
- Forget it.
- No.

1366
01:40:20,036 --> 01:40:22,436
- You've had a bad day today.
- That's why.

1367
01:40:22,605 --> 01:40:24,334
I'd like to end it better.

1368
01:40:26,976 --> 01:40:29,968
He had a crazy plan to
get his revenge on you,

1369
01:40:31,181 --> 01:40:34,014
but to carry it out
he had to bribe us,

1370
01:40:34,184 --> 01:40:37,051
at least, me and
Luis, the editor.

1371
01:40:38,655 --> 01:40:41,351
Even though it was crazy,
there was no problem.

1372
01:40:42,459 --> 01:40:44,791
We both sold out
without any objection.

1373
01:40:45,028 --> 01:40:46,222
Luis and I.

1374
01:40:48,164 --> 01:40:49,324
With me,

1375
01:40:49,766 --> 01:40:52,599
he was courteous enough to
provide me with an alibi.

1376
01:40:53,369 --> 01:40:57,203
He suggested I go to the U.S. for
six weeks, to the Mayo Clinic

1377
01:40:57,373 --> 01:40:59,967
so Diego could be cured
of his aspergillosis.

1378
01:41:00,810 --> 01:41:03,438
That way, I wouldn't
be present while he

1379
01:41:04,614 --> 01:41:06,241
destroyed your film.

1380
01:41:07,717 --> 01:41:09,582
Because that was his plan.

1381
01:41:10,620 --> 01:41:12,679
To reduce the film to rubble.

1382
01:41:18,862 --> 01:41:20,762
I preferred to stay in Madrid

1383
01:41:20,930 --> 01:41:22,898
and have Diego cured here.

1384
01:41:23,433 --> 01:41:25,333
I wanted to witness everything.

1385
01:41:25,435 --> 01:41:27,335
If I was going to betray you,

1386
01:41:27,504 --> 01:41:29,995
I wanted to suffer the
price I had to pay.

1387
01:41:33,843 --> 01:41:35,208
It was torture

1388
01:41:36,246 --> 01:41:39,340
seeing how Ernesto chose
all the worst takes

1389
01:41:39,516 --> 01:41:41,040
and how Luis edited them,

1390
01:41:41,217 --> 01:41:43,378
turning your film
into a monster.

1391
01:41:45,588 --> 01:41:48,614
The only way to bear all
that was to suffer more.

1392
01:41:51,027 --> 01:41:54,519
I sold myself to Ernesto
out of pain and jealousy.

1393
01:41:55,331 --> 01:41:57,196
I couldn't bear or forgive

1394
01:41:57,267 --> 01:42:00,134
that you left with Lena
without saying a word.

1395
01:42:01,971 --> 01:42:05,702
With my treachery, I got my revenge
on you, on her and on myself.

1396
01:42:07,811 --> 01:42:09,711
The only innocent one was Diego.

1397
01:42:11,447 --> 01:42:12,914
Forgive me, love,

1398
01:42:13,716 --> 01:42:16,549
for how bitter I've
been all these years.

1399
01:42:18,121 --> 01:42:20,248
No one deserves to
grow up with that.

1400
01:42:38,274 --> 01:42:40,242
Another gin and tonic, please.

1401
01:42:49,719 --> 01:42:51,448
Don't look at me like that.

1402
01:43:02,699 --> 01:43:04,064
Thank you.

1403
01:43:16,613 --> 01:43:19,776
Don't go on. It isn't necessary.

1404
01:43:19,849 --> 01:43:21,009
Yes.

1405
01:43:21,184 --> 01:43:24,415
Now that you're calling yourself
Mateo again, I've got no excuse.

1406
01:43:24,587 --> 01:43:26,179
You've told us everything.

1407
01:43:27,824 --> 01:43:30,122
No, not everything.

1408
01:43:39,502 --> 01:43:41,436
No one knew where you were.

1409
01:43:41,604 --> 01:43:43,196
We had no idea.

1410
01:43:44,173 --> 01:43:46,107
Ernesto organized all that,

1411
01:43:46,175 --> 01:43:49,303
the premiere, all that
fuss, so that you'd react.

1412
01:43:50,013 --> 01:43:53,915
His revenge was meaningless
if neither of you responded.

1413
01:43:55,518 --> 01:43:58,749
He asked me constantly
about your whereabouts

1414
01:43:58,922 --> 01:44:02,187
but I knew nothing
either, which was true.

1415
01:44:02,525 --> 01:44:06,222
That's why I didn't want to call you,
so as not to complicate your life.

1416
01:44:07,630 --> 01:44:10,861
He hired various detectives
to look for you,

1417
01:44:12,235 --> 01:44:14,362
but before they could find you

1418
01:44:15,238 --> 01:44:16,637
you called me,

1419
01:44:17,740 --> 01:44:19,640
two days after the premiere.

1420
01:44:22,545 --> 01:44:26,504
I was too ashamed to answer

1421
01:44:27,717 --> 01:44:29,082
and too dazed.

1422
01:44:29,252 --> 01:44:30,583
I still am.

1423
01:44:33,489 --> 01:44:36,083
When Ernesto asked
me about you again,

1424
01:44:38,027 --> 01:44:39,255
I don't know why,

1425
01:44:40,330 --> 01:44:42,264
I gave him the number in Famara.

1426
01:44:47,170 --> 01:44:50,162
He sent his son to look
for you on Lanzarote.

1427
01:44:58,748 --> 01:45:02,081
It was Ernesto Junior who
found you after the accident

1428
01:45:02,752 --> 01:45:04,242
and called the hospital.

1429
01:45:04,520 --> 01:45:06,613
Did he have anything to
do with the accident?

1430
01:45:06,689 --> 01:45:07,713
No!

1431
01:45:08,691 --> 01:45:10,352
But I keep thinking

1432
01:45:10,526 --> 01:45:13,256
that if I hadn't given
that number to his father

1433
01:45:13,429 --> 01:45:15,590
perhaps nothing would
have happened.

1434
01:45:18,735 --> 01:45:20,066
Why do you think that?

1435
01:45:22,805 --> 01:45:23,965
I don't know.

1436
01:45:24,807 --> 01:45:26,775
A guilty conscience, I guess.

1437
01:45:26,943 --> 01:45:28,240
Well, that's enough!

1438
01:45:28,411 --> 01:45:31,073
14 years with a guilty
conscience is sufficient.

1439
01:45:59,008 --> 01:46:00,703
Wait, I'll help you down.

1440
01:46:02,078 --> 01:46:03,375
No, thank you.

1441
01:46:03,546 --> 01:46:04,877
Good night.

1442
01:46:12,021 --> 01:46:13,886
Call if you need anything.

1443
01:46:40,583 --> 01:46:44,212
<i>Diego isn't answering.
Leave a message.</i>

1444
01:46:44,921 --> 01:46:47,014
Hello, Diego. It's Mateo.

1445
01:46:49,992 --> 01:46:51,823
I'm sorry to call so early.

1446
01:46:52,628 --> 01:46:54,858
Tell your mother to
call me when she can.

1447
01:46:54,931 --> 01:46:55,920
Thanks.

1448
01:47:28,698 --> 01:47:31,496
- Harry, why so early?
- I couldn't sleep.

1449
01:47:31,667 --> 01:47:33,692
That's too bad!
Coffee and toast?

1450
01:47:33,870 --> 01:47:37,328
Yes, but first would you
call this number for me?

1451
01:47:40,009 --> 01:47:41,442
Ray X?

1452
01:47:48,784 --> 01:47:50,513
- Here.
- Thanks.

1453
01:47:50,686 --> 01:47:52,210
I'll get your coffee.

1454
01:47:53,589 --> 01:47:54,578
Ernesto?

1455
01:47:54,757 --> 01:47:55,781
<i>Who is this?</i>

1456
01:47:55,958 --> 01:47:57,619
I'm sorry to bother you.

1457
01:47:57,793 --> 01:47:59,283
This is Mateo Blanco.

1458
01:48:15,178 --> 01:48:16,611
Look at this!

1459
01:48:17,513 --> 01:48:19,378
You have to start the day well.

1460
01:48:22,718 --> 01:48:24,049
How do you feel?

1461
01:48:24,654 --> 01:48:26,952
A bit hung over, but I'm fine.

1462
01:48:27,924 --> 01:48:30,620
I think the catharsis
last night did me good.

1463
01:48:31,527 --> 01:48:32,824
Let me help you.

1464
01:48:33,129 --> 01:48:34,323
No, sit down.

1465
01:48:35,498 --> 01:48:36,487
Sit down.

1466
01:48:39,168 --> 01:48:40,192
Diego,

1467
01:48:40,670 --> 01:48:43,195
yesterday I had one
more thing to tell you.

1468
01:48:43,372 --> 01:48:45,897
Tell me later. We'll
have breakfast now.

1469
01:48:46,075 --> 01:48:48,805
If I don't tell you now,
I may never tell you.

1470
01:48:51,080 --> 01:48:52,945
At the end of the '80s,

1471
01:48:53,549 --> 01:48:55,949
Mateo and I had a love affair.

1472
01:48:57,386 --> 01:49:01,254
I thought so, even before
the catharsis last night.

1473
01:49:01,424 --> 01:49:02,584
You did?

1474
01:49:02,959 --> 01:49:04,290
It's obvious!

1475
01:49:04,460 --> 01:49:06,724
The same curtains in
your bedroom and in his,

1476
01:49:06,896 --> 01:49:10,161
souvenirs of Mexico and the Caribbean
in both houses, the crosses...

1477
01:49:10,299 --> 01:49:11,323
Right.

1478
01:49:12,335 --> 01:49:14,394
There's something else I
think you don't know.

1479
01:49:17,306 --> 01:49:18,830
Mateo is your father.

1480
01:49:20,176 --> 01:49:21,575
He's my father?

1481
01:49:22,345 --> 01:49:23,642
Yes.

1482
01:49:24,914 --> 01:49:26,541
And the fleeting lover,

1483
01:49:27,149 --> 01:49:29,344
my supposed biological father?

1484
01:49:30,152 --> 01:49:31,312
Did you make him up?

1485
01:49:32,722 --> 01:49:34,314
I can hide things,

1486
01:49:34,490 --> 01:49:36,822
but I'm incapable of
making things up.

1487
01:49:38,094 --> 01:49:40,062
The fleeting lover existed.

1488
01:49:40,229 --> 01:49:42,697
We had an affair. He was gay

1489
01:49:42,865 --> 01:49:45,231
and the affair was very brief.

1490
01:49:48,037 --> 01:49:49,095
Does Mateo know?

1491
01:49:51,173 --> 01:49:52,606
Are you crazy?

1492
01:49:52,775 --> 01:49:55,608
At the time he asked me and
I denied it, of course.

1493
01:49:56,145 --> 01:49:57,806
I didn't want to pressure him.

1494
01:49:58,447 --> 01:50:00,881
I didn't want that to
change our relationship.

1495
01:50:00,950 --> 01:50:03,510
And I'd never asked him if
he wanted to be a father.

1496
01:50:04,654 --> 01:50:05,712
Fuck!

1497
01:50:05,888 --> 01:50:07,378
So Mateo's my father.

1498
01:50:10,059 --> 01:50:12,493
By the way, he rang
early this morning.

1499
01:50:12,895 --> 01:50:14,795
Mateo? What did he want?

1500
01:50:15,298 --> 01:50:17,061
You're to call him when you can.

1501
01:50:17,233 --> 01:50:18,666
Why didn't you waken me?

1502
01:50:18,834 --> 01:50:21,359
Because after last night
you needed to rest

1503
01:50:21,537 --> 01:50:23,505
and he didn't say it was urgent.

1504
01:50:24,006 --> 01:50:25,473
Pass me the phone.

1505
01:50:31,113 --> 01:50:32,375
<i>- Yes?
- Hello.</i>

1506
01:50:32,982 --> 01:50:36,645
Diego told me you rang. Are you okay?
Do you need anything?

1507
01:50:37,019 --> 01:50:38,452
No, I'm not okay,

1508
01:50:38,788 --> 01:50:40,881
and, yes, I do need something.

1509
01:50:41,357 --> 01:50:45,225
The 40,000 meters of negative we
shot in my last film, to edit it.

1510
01:50:46,662 --> 01:50:48,152
<i>I'm at Ernesto Junior's house,</i>

1511
01:50:48,331 --> 01:50:52,392
and I've found out that the
material was destroyed in '94.

1512
01:50:53,736 --> 01:50:55,328
I imagined something like that,

1513
01:50:56,272 --> 01:50:57,830
but I didn't think
they'd do it so soon.

1514
01:50:58,140 --> 01:51:01,667
- Why are you in Ernesto's house?
- I think I'll blackmail him.

1515
01:51:01,977 --> 01:51:04,275
We need money, and he's
got lots to spare.

1516
01:51:04,447 --> 01:51:06,847
I don't want Diego going
back to that damn bar.

1517
01:51:07,016 --> 01:51:08,506
I want to pay him a salary.

1518
01:51:11,454 --> 01:51:12,853
Don't be crazy.

1519
01:51:13,022 --> 01:51:15,855
There's no one else to
accuse of Magdalena's death.

1520
01:51:17,193 --> 01:51:18,592
Oh, God!

1521
01:51:19,829 --> 01:51:21,694
Wait, I've got
something to tell you.

1522
01:51:21,864 --> 01:51:24,355
Last night you said enough.

1523
01:51:24,533 --> 01:51:26,592
Listen to me!

1524
01:51:27,169 --> 01:51:29,364
I was production
manager on the film,

1525
01:51:29,538 --> 01:51:32,530
the only person with access
to the lab and the material.

1526
01:51:33,876 --> 01:51:37,243
After giving Ernesto's order to
destroy it, I intercepted it

1527
01:51:37,413 --> 01:51:39,643
and I kept it. I've
got it all at home.

1528
01:51:40,716 --> 01:51:42,047
You're lying.

1529
01:51:43,219 --> 01:51:46,882
I didn't tell you last night because
I didn't know you wanted to edit it.

1530
01:51:47,156 --> 01:51:48,623
I took it all,

1531
01:51:49,225 --> 01:51:52,854
the double takes, the interneg,
the sound tapes, everything!

1532
01:51:53,496 --> 01:51:55,123
You can have it all.

1533
01:51:55,498 --> 01:51:56,726
That changes everything.

1534
01:51:56,799 --> 01:51:58,323
Get out of there

1535
01:51:58,667 --> 01:52:02,068
and leave Ernesto in peace. He's
got nothing to do with this.

1536
01:52:02,238 --> 01:52:05,071
He still has to tell me
why he was in Lanzarote.

1537
01:52:05,241 --> 01:52:07,505
Bye, I'll call you later.

1538
01:52:15,918 --> 01:52:17,647
Ernesto and his camera.

1539
01:52:19,188 --> 01:52:20,849
<i>You remind me of Peeping Tom.</i>

1540
01:52:21,357 --> 01:52:24,918
Yes, but I never
wanted to kill you.

1541
01:52:25,728 --> 01:52:27,059
I'm not so sure.

1542
01:52:30,065 --> 01:52:32,556
<i>This copy of The Making
of will prove it.</i>

1543
01:52:34,136 --> 01:52:36,400
Why do I want it?
I can't see it.

1544
01:52:36,572 --> 01:52:39,473
Someone you trust can see
it and tell you. Excuse me.

1545
01:52:41,177 --> 01:52:44,408
These are the final images of the
documentary on Mateo Blanco,

1546
01:52:44,580 --> 01:52:46,104
also known as Harry Caine.

1547
01:53:31,293 --> 01:53:33,818
How's the documentary,
as Ernesto calls it?

1548
01:53:36,398 --> 01:53:37,865
Very interesting.

1549
01:53:39,535 --> 01:53:41,025
What are you seeing now?

1550
01:53:42,738 --> 01:53:45,206
The last night, coming
back from the restaurant.

1551
01:53:45,608 --> 01:53:48,338
How could he tape us?
It was very dark.

1552
01:53:50,980 --> 01:53:54,245
His car headlights and the
lighting on the mobile sculpture

1553
01:53:54,416 --> 01:53:56,441
were enough to see
what happened.

1554
01:53:57,586 --> 01:54:00,316
And he's retouched it digitally.

1555
01:54:01,857 --> 01:54:05,315
Ernesto didn't cause
the accident,

1556
01:54:05,761 --> 01:54:08,252
and, as well, he was
the first to help you.

1557
01:54:08,430 --> 01:54:10,660
How could he tape and
drive at the same time?

1558
01:54:11,800 --> 01:54:12,994
I don't know.

1559
01:54:14,103 --> 01:54:16,037
Anything else I should know?

1560
01:54:18,274 --> 01:54:19,707
What are you watching now?

1561
01:54:21,310 --> 01:54:22,800
When you were waiting
at the roundabout

1562
01:54:22,878 --> 01:54:24,641
for a car to pass on your left,

1563
01:54:25,548 --> 01:54:27,106
Lena and you kissed.

1564
01:54:27,283 --> 01:54:29,342
We kissed? I don't
remember that.

1565
01:54:31,020 --> 01:54:32,419
It's a normal kiss,

1566
01:54:32,588 --> 01:54:35,216
the kind couples give
each other out of habit.

1567
01:54:36,759 --> 01:54:38,283
The last kiss.

1568
01:54:39,728 --> 01:54:40,752
Yes.

1569
01:54:42,598 --> 01:54:45,465
Lena didn't die in your
arms like you'd dreamed,

1570
01:54:47,136 --> 01:54:50,162
but the last sensation
she took from this world

1571
01:54:50,339 --> 01:54:51,897
was the taste of your mouth.

1572
01:55:01,216 --> 01:55:02,342
Is it here?

1573
01:55:03,052 --> 01:55:04,314
Yes.

1574
01:55:07,590 --> 01:55:10,559
Play it frame by frame,
so that it lasts longer.

1575
01:55:51,667 --> 01:55:53,999
<i>14 years after shooting it,</i>

1576
01:55:54,169 --> 01:55:56,865
<i>I could finally edit
Girls and Suitcases.</i>

1577
01:56:11,387 --> 01:56:13,480
- It's you...
- I left you 1,000 messages.

1578
01:56:13,656 --> 01:56:15,487
1,000 from you and
none from Ivan.

1579
01:56:15,658 --> 01:56:16,852
What's that suitcase?

1580
01:56:17,026 --> 01:56:19,324
It's Ivan's. He's leaving me.

1581
01:56:19,495 --> 01:56:20,792
And the crutches?

1582
01:56:20,963 --> 01:56:24,194
His ex-wife, the lunatic,
pushed me down the stairs.

1583
01:56:24,366 --> 01:56:26,857
I've split up with
my husband, too.

1584
01:56:27,036 --> 01:56:28,401
I'm sorry.

1585
01:56:29,038 --> 01:56:31,336
I've made coffee, do
you mind pouring it?

1586
01:56:31,874 --> 01:56:33,899
I was looking for
Ivan all night.

1587
01:56:34,076 --> 01:56:37,409
Then I had a photo session,
and I still haven't slept.

1588
01:56:37,579 --> 01:56:39,171
Neither have I.

1589
01:56:39,348 --> 01:56:42,044
- When did you two split up?
- Four days ago.

1590
01:56:42,217 --> 01:56:43,479
Sugar?

1591
01:56:44,386 --> 01:56:45,785
I saw it coming.

1592
01:56:45,954 --> 01:56:48,013
But after we broke up, I
went out on the street

1593
01:56:48,090 --> 01:56:49,455
and saw a guy looking at me.

1594
01:56:49,992 --> 01:56:52,085
Gazpacho! I'll have some.

1595
01:56:52,161 --> 01:56:53,185
No!

1596
01:56:53,262 --> 01:56:55,526
I put in a whole box
of sleeping pills.

1597
01:56:56,165 --> 01:56:57,189
Why?

1598
01:56:57,833 --> 01:56:59,266
In case Ivan came.

1599
01:56:59,435 --> 01:57:00,697
He loves gazpacho.

1600
01:57:00,869 --> 01:57:02,530
Really, Pina!

1601
01:57:02,705 --> 01:57:05,503
That's nothing. As he didn't
call, I tore out the phone.

1602
01:57:05,607 --> 01:57:06,665
I tripped over it,

1603
01:57:06,742 --> 01:57:09,438
but I didn't ask because I don't
want to be inquisitive...

1604
01:57:10,713 --> 01:57:12,010
The bed...

1605
01:57:12,181 --> 01:57:14,012
ls that smoke?

1606
01:57:14,850 --> 01:57:18,308
I dropped a match and it went on fire.
I didn't want to put it out.

1607
01:57:18,487 --> 01:57:19,852
Fire purifies.

1608
01:57:20,355 --> 01:57:21,549
Get your coffee.

1609
01:57:25,894 --> 01:57:27,691
Were you telling me something?

1610
01:57:28,897 --> 01:57:30,194
Oh, yes!

1611
01:57:35,738 --> 01:57:37,672
I was telling you

1612
01:57:37,740 --> 01:57:41,141
that I've got a
suitcase at home, too.

1613
01:57:41,310 --> 01:57:42,334
Your husband's?

1614
01:57:42,411 --> 01:57:43,435
No.

1615
01:57:44,213 --> 01:57:48,047
A suitcase with 30 pounds of
top quality, uncut cocaine.

1616
01:57:48,350 --> 01:57:49,977
Are you a dealer now?

1617
01:57:50,052 --> 01:57:52,543
No! I'm still a Councillor
for Social Affairs.

1618
01:57:52,888 --> 01:57:54,321
The suitcase appeared
in my closet,

1619
01:57:54,389 --> 01:57:55,515
all of a sudden.

1620
01:57:58,127 --> 01:58:01,062
I have to get rid of those
30 pounds right away.

1621
01:58:01,363 --> 01:58:03,923
There's a lot of drugs in
politics, because of the hours.

1622
01:58:04,099 --> 01:58:06,363
Between the party
and the Council,

1623
01:58:06,435 --> 01:58:08,903
I could shift five
pounds, but the rest?

1624
01:58:09,071 --> 01:58:10,231
Throw it away!

1625
01:58:10,639 --> 01:58:11,936
Are you crazy?

1626
01:58:12,007 --> 01:58:14,771
I have to make sure the police
don't find it in my house.

1627
01:58:15,277 --> 01:58:16,301
I don't understand...

1628
01:58:16,378 --> 01:58:17,606
It's obvious!

1629
01:58:17,780 --> 01:58:21,580
If they catch me with all that
cocaine, they'll arrest me.

1630
01:58:21,750 --> 01:58:25,516
Yes, but I don't understand how
the case appeared in your closet.

1631
01:58:30,192 --> 01:58:32,854
As I was saying, after I
split up with my husband

1632
01:58:32,928 --> 01:58:35,624
I went out on the street and
there was a guy eyeing me,

1633
01:58:36,298 --> 01:58:37,356
good-looking,

1634
01:58:37,866 --> 01:58:39,026
his ass...

1635
01:58:39,201 --> 01:58:40,759
His feet...

1636
01:58:41,203 --> 01:58:43,535
I brought him home and
screwed him several times.

1637
01:58:43,705 --> 01:58:46,640
I'm very interested in
sex as a social matter.

1638
01:58:48,243 --> 01:58:49,232
How was it?

1639
01:58:49,411 --> 01:58:51,743
In bed? A virtuoso.

1640
01:58:52,114 --> 01:58:53,911
I've never seen
anything like it.

1641
01:58:54,883 --> 01:58:56,441
What a big toe!

1642
01:58:57,553 --> 01:58:59,646
Look, my hairs are
standing on end.

1643
01:59:00,155 --> 01:59:01,486
Then what happened?

1644
01:59:01,557 --> 01:59:03,184
After we screwed,

1645
01:59:03,258 --> 01:59:05,920
he asked if he could stay
with me for a few days.

1646
01:59:05,994 --> 01:59:09,293
- Got any muffins?
- Yes, on the shelf.

1647
01:59:10,165 --> 01:59:13,430
- And there's creme caramel.
- I'll have that afterwards.

1648
01:59:14,837 --> 01:59:18,671
So, he asked if he could
stay and I said all right,

1649
01:59:18,740 --> 01:59:19,832
but I wasn't promising anything.

1650
01:59:19,908 --> 01:59:22,274
I didn't want him to think
I was an easy woman.

1651
01:59:22,744 --> 01:59:26,475
Anyway, he turned up with
a suitcase and moved in.

1652
01:59:27,649 --> 01:59:30,049
Last night, on TV,

1653
01:59:30,686 --> 01:59:35,055
I saw he'd been arrested
in a drugs bust.

1654
01:59:35,891 --> 01:59:39,054
He's one of the biggest drug
traffickers in the country.

1655
01:59:39,661 --> 01:59:40,855
What?

1656
01:59:42,030 --> 01:59:44,191
So, kind of suspicious,

1657
01:59:45,100 --> 01:59:46,499
I open the suitcase

1658
01:59:47,269 --> 01:59:50,170
and I see it's full
of bags of cocaine.

1659
01:59:54,109 --> 01:59:55,337
I took one,

1660
01:59:56,278 --> 01:59:58,872
went out on the street and
haven't been back since.

1661
02:00:01,016 --> 02:00:02,643
What a story!

1662
02:00:02,818 --> 02:00:05,048
I was surprised he
screwed so well.

1663
02:00:06,822 --> 02:00:09,052
For men who live at
that level of risk,

1664
02:00:09,124 --> 02:00:12,560
it's like every screw is the last.
And there's no comparison.

1665
02:00:12,728 --> 02:00:14,787
Look at those goose bumps!

1666
02:00:14,963 --> 02:00:17,295
Yeah, I saw it before.
You've got a talent...

1667
02:00:17,733 --> 02:00:18,927
And the suitcase?

1668
02:00:19,001 --> 02:00:20,059
The suitcase?

1669
02:00:20,602 --> 02:00:21,899
Well,

1670
02:00:22,537 --> 02:00:25,370
I was going to ask if I
could bring it here.

1671
02:00:26,074 --> 02:00:28,099
- You hear?
- Yes.

1672
02:00:28,277 --> 02:00:29,744
I'll bring it here.

1673
02:00:30,279 --> 02:00:33,407
If they find it in my house, it's
not for what could happen to me,

1674
02:00:33,482 --> 02:00:36,076
although it's not ideal for a
councillor for social affairs,

1675
02:00:36,151 --> 02:00:39,587
but the mayor would be so
upset, and my party...

1676
02:00:39,655 --> 02:00:41,919
It couldn't take
another scandal.

1677
02:00:42,090 --> 02:00:43,557
Don't shout.

1678
02:00:44,259 --> 02:00:45,590
The police!

1679
02:00:45,761 --> 02:00:48,889
How could it be? No one
knows you're here.

1680
02:00:49,064 --> 02:00:51,658
I've been very striking
since I was a child.

1681
02:00:51,833 --> 02:00:54,097
Act like you've come for coffee.

1682
02:01:10,419 --> 02:01:12,387
That's what we've got re-edited.

1683
02:01:13,555 --> 02:01:15,887
Do you think it's
worth carrying on,

1684
02:01:16,425 --> 02:01:17,949
or is it crazy?

1685
02:01:18,193 --> 02:01:22,357
What? I pissed myself laughing.
I'm dying to see what happens.

1686
02:01:26,835 --> 02:01:28,860
It's wonderful, Mateo!

1687
02:01:29,137 --> 02:01:31,264
It's hilarious. You
have to re-release it.

1688
02:01:31,340 --> 02:01:33,171
No, what matters
is to finish it.

1689
02:01:33,675 --> 02:01:36,769
Films have to be finished,
even if you do it blindly.

1690
02:02:35,800 --> 02:02:39,100
