1
00:01:26,083 --> 00:01:30,042
THE SKIN I LIVE IN

2
00:02:39,542 --> 00:02:41,833
Help me with the dumbwaiter.

3
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:47,375
Open it.

4
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,750
Take this.

5
00:03:14,667 --> 00:03:16,417
Marilia, are you there?

6
00:03:20,292 --> 00:03:21,417
Yes.

7
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:24,458
Send up more sackcloth
and double-sided tape.

8
00:03:25,292 --> 00:03:27,750
I can't get it until tomorrow.

9
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:29,958
OK.

10
00:03:31,667 --> 00:03:36,417
I also wanted a needle,
thread and scissors.

11
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:38,875
You're joking, right?

12
00:03:39,792 --> 00:03:41,500
Yeah.

13
00:04:19,667 --> 00:04:22,000
Our face identifies us.

14
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:25,500
For burn victims,
saving their lives is not enough.

15
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:31,083
They need to have a face
even if it's from a corpse.

16
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:32,458
A face with features...

17
00:04:32,542 --> 00:04:35,292
so they can gesticulate.

18
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:36,917
I have participated in

19
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:39,500
three out of the nine
face transplants

20
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:43,125
 carried out in the world...

21
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:46,667
and they were the most moving
experiences of my life.

22
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:50,125
Good...

23
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:52,792
For a shapeless mass to acquire
the features that will give it expression...

24
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:56,500
we have to mold the muscles...

25
00:04:56,583 --> 00:05:02,708
articulating the facial musculature
with the corresponding nerve endings.

26
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:04,542
MATERNITY HOSPITAL

27
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:53,375
Vera, I've brought you some opium.

28
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:05,375
OPERATING THEATER

29
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:29,458
Can you breathe more gently?

30
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:32,542
If you want me
to stop breathing, kill me.

31
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:34,292
Don't talk rubbish.

32
00:09:37,292 --> 00:09:39,583
How long will all this last?

33
00:09:39,792 --> 00:09:42,458
Your skin is softer than I tohught.

34
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,958
If you don't end it, I will.

35
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:47,333
If you'd wanted to kill yourself...

36
00:09:47,417 --> 00:09:49,583
you'd have tried to cut your jugular.

37
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:51,750
In any case...

38
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:56,167
I didn't know your skin was so soft.

39
00:10:04,542 --> 00:10:06,125
Here it is...

40
00:10:06,667 --> 00:10:08,958
taken from the animal
while it was still alive.

41
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:11,625
Thank you.

42
00:13:22,542 --> 00:13:25,375
Now there won't be any more burns.

43
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:29,583
You said that a year ago.

44
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,375
I was hasty.

45
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:41,500
Tell me if it burns you.

46
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:43,333
No.

47
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:47,542
And now?

48
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:49,792
No.

49
00:13:51,792 --> 00:13:53,500
Now!

50
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:55,167
I have given the name "Gal"...

51
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:57,583
to the artificial skin
I've been working on...

52
00:13:57,667 --> 00:13:58,708
in recent years.

53
00:13:58,792 --> 00:14:01,500
Tell me if the mosquito bites you.

54
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:04,875
This skin is resistant
to every insect bite...

55
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:06,292
No.

56
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:08,500
...which means a natural barrier to

57
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:11,958
...malaria, for example.

58
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:16,125
Naturally, I've carried out
a rigorous quality control...

59
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:19,083
on the tissues implanted in mammals...

60
00:14:19,167 --> 00:14:20,167
specifically, in athymic mice...

61
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:22,250
and the results...

62
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:27,125
...have been spectacular.

63
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:29,042
This leads me to suppose

64
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:31,125
they would be equally positive...

65
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:33,000
in human mammals.

66
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:38,583
What does the name Gal mean?
Are they initials?

67
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:40,292
That was my wife's name.

68
00:14:40,417 --> 00:14:42,625
She was burned to death in a car crash.

69
00:14:42,792 --> 00:14:45,542
In you presentation you stated...

70
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:50,625
that the skin is resistant to insect bites
and could prevent malaria.

71
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,458
What makes you think that?

72
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:56,083
The artificial skin is much harder
than human skin...

73
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:57,833
and it smells different.

74
00:14:57,958 --> 00:14:59,583
It's been proven that the malaria mosquito...

75
00:14:59,667 --> 00:15:02,250
distinguishes human skin by the smell.

76
00:15:02,417 --> 00:15:04,917
Gal smells different and repels it.

77
00:15:05,042 --> 00:15:07,000
Let's see if we can get rid of him.

78
00:15:07,167 --> 00:15:08,708
That isn't enough.

79
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:12,917
How did you toughen the skin?

80
00:15:13,417 --> 00:15:15,000
Excuse me.

81
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,292
Let's go somewhere quieter.

82
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:21,833
There's only one way to toughen skin.

83
00:15:21,917 --> 00:15:23,708
By mutating it.

84
00:15:24,417 --> 00:15:26,000
Yes, that's what I did.

85
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:27,750
Transgenesis.

86
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:32,250
Yes.
I transferred genetic information...

87
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,917
from a pig's cell to a human cell.

88
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:37,708
A pig's cell?

89
00:15:37,792 --> 00:15:39,583
It's much stronger than ours.

90
00:15:39,667 --> 00:15:41,167
You're insane!

91
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:44,625
You know the application
of transgenetic therepy...

92
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,292
in humans is completely forbidden!

93
00:15:46,417 --> 00:15:47,500
Yes, I do.

94
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:51,292
And, forgive me,
but it seems the ultimate paradox.

95
00:15:51,917 --> 00:15:54,458
We intervene in everything around us...

96
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:57,833
meat, clothes,
vegetables, fruit, everything!

97
00:15:57,917 --> 00:16:01,708
Why not use scientific advances
to improve our species?

98
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,167
You know how many diseases...

99
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,250
we could cure with transgenesis?

100
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:07,708
Or the genetic malformations
that could be avoided?

101
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,208
Don't go on!

102
00:16:09,292 --> 00:16:11,417
I know the list by heart...

103
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:14,375
and I think of it every day.

104
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:16,667
But even so...

105
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:20,125
I must forbid you from
investigating further...

106
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,250
or I'll be forced to report you...

107
00:16:22,292 --> 00:16:23,917
to the scientific community.

108
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,958
Over and above what you or I may think...

109
00:16:26,042 --> 00:16:30,042
the bioethics are
absolutely clear about this.

110
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:35,417
Don't worry.
Gal was a personal adventure.

111
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:38,000
I did it in memory of my wife...

112
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:40,792
and solely to extend my knowledge.

113
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:41,833
I remember...

114
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:44,833
the first time
you told me about this experiment.

115
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:47,208
It seemed like a dream then.

116
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:49,125
And it still is.

117
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:52,625
The president has ordered me
to give it up, indefinitely.

118
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:55,000
Shit, and it'll be the business
of the century.

119
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:58,958
It will be,
but we won't benefit from it.

120
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:03,792
If you give up research,
will you go back to surgery?

121
00:17:03,917 --> 00:17:06,667
Your patients will be delighted.

122
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:09,375
I don't know.

123
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,542
We've got a waiting list
for operations in "El Cigarral".

124
00:17:12,667 --> 00:17:15,417
- I'm leaving.
- Wait, so am I.

125
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:12,042
Do you like what you see?

126
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:15,583
What do you mean?

127
00:19:17,667 --> 00:19:20,292
Is there anything you want to improve?

128
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:23,125
No.

129
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:26,083
I don't want to improve anything.

130
00:19:27,292 --> 00:19:30,125
Can I take it I'm finished?

131
00:19:31,167 --> 00:19:32,833
Yes...

132
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:36,542
and you can boast of having
the best skin in the world.

133
00:19:42,792 --> 00:19:44,875
And now what?

134
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:48,083
Now I'm going to light
this opium pipe...

135
00:19:48,167 --> 00:19:50,042
and smoke it.

136
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:52,333
I mean us.

137
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:54,792
Me.

138
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:58,000
What are you going to do with me?

139
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:01,292
I don't know.
I'll think about it.

140
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:02,500
When?

141
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:05,125
If you keep on, I'm leaving!

142
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:08,750
Couldn't we just live?

143
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:12,375
Live together.

144
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:14,750
Live together?

145
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:18,125
- How?
- Like everyone.

146
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:22,375
You and I aren't like everyone.

147
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:26,625
Look on it as another
of your experiments.

148
00:20:26,667 --> 00:20:28,083
Living together as equals.

149
00:20:28,167 --> 00:20:31,000
That's it!

150
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:40,167
Here.

151
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:43,292
I could set fire
to the house with this.

152
00:20:49,542 --> 00:20:51,250
I'm yours.

153
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:54,583
I'm made to measure for you.

154
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:58,000
And you've just told me
that you like me.

155
00:20:58,417 --> 00:21:00,250
Did I say that?

156
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:05,083
I know you look at me.

157
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:08,458
Since you brought me here,

158
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,250
we practically live in the same room.

159
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,083
In this pocket.

160
00:21:55,375 --> 00:22:02,500
<i>Carnival celebrations
are being held on the Gran Via.

161
00:22:09,167 --> 00:22:11,708
You shouldn't have used her face.

162
00:22:12,042 --> 00:22:15,292
If I'd been here,
I'd have warned you of the danger.

163
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:17,917
There's a resemblance,
but she isn't the same.

164
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,083
The resemblance is too strong.

165
00:22:20,667 --> 00:22:22,958
Have you thought
what to do with her?

166
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:24,375
No.

167
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:28,667
You'll have to kill her
or keep her hidden here forever.

168
00:22:29,958 --> 00:22:32,750
Why all the hurry to get rid of her?

169
00:22:33,042 --> 00:22:36,083
If you don't kill her,
she'll kill herself.

170
00:22:36,417 --> 00:22:38,583
Stories repeat themselves.

171
00:22:39,875 --> 00:22:41,583
No! Not this one!

172
00:22:42,125 --> 00:22:45,667
Vera is stronger, a born survivor.

173
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
You're sick.

174
00:22:48,292 --> 00:22:49,667
If you don't get rid of her...

175
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:52,917
what you feel now will end up
devouring you, like a cancer.

176
00:22:53,667 --> 00:22:56,375
When you realize, it'll be too late.

177
00:22:57,875 --> 00:23:01,542
How are you so sure of what I feel
if even I don't know?

178
00:23:02,958 --> 00:23:05,875
Because I know you as if I'd borne you.

179
00:23:06,083 --> 00:23:08,750
Fire the servants
and don't hire anyone.

180
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:47,250
What do you want?

181
00:23:47,625 --> 00:23:51,333
<i>To see my mother.
I haven't seen her for ten years.

182
00:23:51,542 --> 00:23:52,667
If she was a servant...

183
00:23:52,708 --> 00:23:55,083
they've just left and won't be back.

184
00:23:56,333 --> 00:23:59,042
<i>I saw them,
but she wasn't one of them.

185
00:23:59,208 --> 00:24:00,792
<i>My mother is prettier.

186
00:24:00,875 --> 00:24:02,833
Go away or I'll call the police.

187
00:24:15,333 --> 00:24:17,167
Zeca!

188
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:22,667
I'm your son, Zeca.

189
00:24:22,792 --> 00:24:24,542
How dare you come here!

190
00:24:24,667 --> 00:24:26,083
Open the door!

191
00:24:26,167 --> 00:24:31,917
It's Carnival. We're both far
from Bahia and I'm homesick.

192
00:24:32,333 --> 00:24:36,750
Look! Like the costume I wore
when I was little. Remember?

193
00:24:39,917 --> 00:24:41,625
Little tiger!

194
00:24:41,833 --> 00:24:44,125
I just want to see you for a minute.

195
00:24:44,292 --> 00:24:47,042
Very well, but then you leave.

196
00:24:47,458 --> 00:24:49,042
Whatever you say.

197
00:24:49,167 --> 00:24:53,750
Follow the path and keep going
through the second gate.

198
00:25:18,833 --> 00:25:20,208
How did you find us?

199
00:25:20,292 --> 00:25:24,417
I've been in Spain a while.
I saw Robert in the paper.

200
00:25:24,583 --> 00:25:26,333
He was giving a...

201
00:25:28,167 --> 00:25:29,750
I don't know,
something in Madrid.

202
00:25:29,833 --> 00:25:31,750
I went there
and then followed him here.

203
00:25:31,792 --> 00:25:32,875
Can't I come in?

204
00:25:32,917 --> 00:25:36,250
No, I'm not allowed visitors.

205
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:39,458
It smells good.
I'm hungary.

206
00:25:41,417 --> 00:25:42,875
Brute!

207
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:54,208
<i>The main new items today...

208
00:25:54,292 --> 00:25:57,042
<i>are the Carnival celebrations...

209
00:25:57,167 --> 00:26:00,333
<i>and the daring robbery commited
in the Bvlgari jewelry store...

210
00:26:00,375 --> 00:26:02,375
<i>in the heart of Madrid.

211
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,792
<i>It happened last night...

212
00:26:03,917 --> 00:26:06,375
<i>and today we have the first images
recorded by one...

213
00:26:06,417 --> 00:26:12,625
<i>of the twenty-four security cameras
which protect the jewelry store.

214
00:26:13,875 --> 00:26:16,208
<i>Apart from the thief,
who appears in the image...

215
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:19,792
<i>police are looking
for one of the store's employees...

216
00:26:19,875 --> 00:26:23,875
<i>who has been missing
for the last twenty-four hours.

217
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:27,250
As if they were going to find him!

218
00:26:28,208 --> 00:26:30,500
The bastard just had to
turn off the cameras...

219
00:26:30,583 --> 00:26:32,917
but he changed his mind
and left one working.

220
00:26:33,042 --> 00:26:35,583
He'll be rotting in hell now.

221
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:37,542
And the police are looking for you.

222
00:26:37,625 --> 00:26:41,542
Sure. If it weren't Carnival,
I couldn't go out.

223
00:26:41,917 --> 00:26:43,917
You can hide me here for a few days.

224
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,458
Hide you here?

225
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,625
Not a chance.

226
00:26:46,875 --> 00:26:49,583
We've got loads of patients.
A lot of people come here.

227
00:26:49,667 --> 00:26:51,667
I know how to hide.

228
00:26:51,792 --> 00:26:55,333
Anyway, I want Robert
to operate on my face.

229
00:26:55,458 --> 00:26:57,167
Robert?

230
00:26:57,208 --> 00:26:59,292
When he gets you on the table...

231
00:26:59,333 --> 00:27:02,458
he'll give you a lethal injection!

232
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:05,083
How could you think
he'd operate on you...

233
00:27:05,083 --> 00:27:06,542
after what you did?

234
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:08,750
I'll have to blackmail him.

235
00:27:11,458 --> 00:27:14,750
If I kidnap you,
could I make him do it?

236
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:18,167
You're raving mad.

237
00:27:18,542 --> 00:27:21,000
I'm just a servant.

238
00:27:21,417 --> 00:27:24,167
Anyway, Robert's out of Spain.

239
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,083
Even better.

240
00:27:27,292 --> 00:27:29,750
I'll stay here till he comes back.

241
00:27:33,625 --> 00:27:35,000
Where are you going?

242
00:27:35,083 --> 00:27:37,542
- What do you want
- A drink.

243
00:27:40,167 --> 00:27:43,500
Take the bottle,
take what you want, just get out!

244
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:10,958
What's this?

245
00:28:11,083 --> 00:28:12,625
It's a film!

246
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,500
Go away!

247
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:41,958
- She reminds me of...
- She doesn't remind you of anybody!

248
00:28:42,667 --> 00:28:44,250
Get out or I'll shoot.

249
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,958
Mom...

250
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:50,500
you wouldn't do that to your son.

251
00:28:51,292 --> 00:28:55,125
You're not my son.
I just gave birth to you.

252
00:28:55,833 --> 00:28:58,292
- It's her.
- It's not her!

253
00:28:58,375 --> 00:28:59,917
How could it be her?

254
00:29:00,333 --> 00:29:02,000
Get out of here!

255
00:29:02,125 --> 00:29:03,542
Keep away!

256
00:29:10,917 --> 00:29:12,625
Marilia?

257
00:29:13,375 --> 00:29:15,875
I heard a noise, like a shot.

258
00:29:16,417 --> 00:29:17,917
Is anything wrong?

259
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,958
<i>I heard voices too.

260
00:29:21,042 --> 00:29:22,667
<i>Marilia?

261
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,500
Marilia!

262
00:29:47,208 --> 00:29:48,750
There.

263
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:18,042
Who is it?

264
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:20,125
It's me, Zeca. Open the door.

265
00:31:20,667 --> 00:31:22,042
I can't.

266
00:31:22,167 --> 00:31:25,083
- Why not?
- I haven't got the key.

267
00:31:25,292 --> 00:31:26,917
Does Marilia have it?

268
00:31:27,167 --> 00:31:29,458
- I don't know.
- What are you doing here?

269
00:31:52,292 --> 00:31:54,708
If you scream, I'll break your jaw.

270
00:32:02,917 --> 00:32:05,125
Where's the key to upstairs?

271
00:32:06,125 --> 00:32:08,250
In the drawer at the corner.

272
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:10,583
Untie me and I'll give it to you.

273
00:32:10,625 --> 00:32:12,333
No, where is it?

274
00:32:13,083 --> 00:32:16,750
In that drawer, in an envelope.

275
00:32:23,208 --> 00:32:25,500
- It's not here!
- At the back!

276
00:32:31,042 --> 00:32:32,875
There's just an envelope
that says "clips".

277
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,958
- That's to fool people, idiot!
- Look inside.

278
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,958
No. Not the napkin. No, no, no!

279
00:32:47,042 --> 00:32:49,542
- Yes, or else you'll scream.
- No, untie me, please!

280
00:32:49,667 --> 00:32:51,000
Open your mouth!

281
00:32:52,667 --> 00:32:56,625
Open it wider, mom!

282
00:32:57,792 --> 00:33:00,333
It all fit before.

283
00:33:46,917 --> 00:33:48,625
Did Robert send you?

284
00:33:49,625 --> 00:33:50,917
No.

285
00:33:51,083 --> 00:33:54,583
How did you survive?
I left you burning like a torch.

286
00:33:58,542 --> 00:34:01,375
He saved me.

287
00:34:02,917 --> 00:34:05,000
Get me out of here!

288
00:34:05,083 --> 00:34:07,125
I'll go anywhere with you!

289
00:34:08,625 --> 00:34:10,417
You're saying that...

290
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,250
because I'm on top of you.

291
00:34:13,125 --> 00:34:14,458
No!

292
00:34:15,083 --> 00:34:18,708
Ask me for anything!

293
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:21,750
What can you give me,
apart from a great fuck?

294
00:34:21,875 --> 00:34:24,458
I don't know. Lots of things!

295
00:34:24,875 --> 00:34:26,500
I'll do whatever you want.

296
00:34:28,792 --> 00:34:30,833
You could help me with Robert.

297
00:34:30,958 --> 00:34:32,750
How do you get on with him now?

298
00:34:33,667 --> 00:34:35,208
Great.

299
00:34:36,042 --> 00:34:38,417
- Great?
- Yes.

300
00:34:38,875 --> 00:34:42,250
- And he still locks you in?
- You know what he's like!

301
00:34:42,333 --> 00:34:43,792
Yes.

302
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:47,875
I'll take you with me.

303
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,958
That might soften his heart
and he'll fix my face.

304
00:34:51,042 --> 00:34:55,417
If you kidnap me,
you can ask him for anything!

305
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,667
I'll kidnap you, but first we'll fuck.

306
00:35:04,708 --> 00:35:05,958
Listen...

307
00:35:06,708 --> 00:35:07,667
What?

308
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:10,042
Lets fuck in the garden, please!

309
00:35:10,125 --> 00:35:14,042
The garden? Why?
I'm sick of screwing in the open air.

310
00:35:14,333 --> 00:35:16,208
This tiger wants a bed.

311
00:35:22,917 --> 00:35:24,625
Don't you like it?

312
00:35:24,958 --> 00:35:26,417
You're hurting me.

313
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:28,667
It's very big.

314
00:35:28,792 --> 00:35:31,542
It's like it always was.
It used to drive you crazy.

315
00:35:32,083 --> 00:35:33,042
Yes...

316
00:35:33,042 --> 00:35:35,708
and it still does.
It drives me crazy!

317
00:35:35,958 --> 00:35:40,542
Shut up! You're weird,
you're distracting me.

318
00:36:54,167 --> 00:36:55,833
Kill her!

319
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,500
Kill them both!

320
00:37:28,083 --> 00:37:31,333
As children,
they played at killing each other.

321
00:37:32,542 --> 00:37:35,917
I knew that one day
they'd do it for real.

322
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,125
The tiger and Robert?

323
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:42,167
Yes.

324
00:37:42,875 --> 00:37:44,458
They're brothers...

325
00:37:45,458 --> 00:37:47,583
but they don't know it.

326
00:37:48,333 --> 00:37:50,667
At least I've never told them.

327
00:37:52,708 --> 00:37:56,375
I had Zeca by a servant
who disappeared soon after.

328
00:37:57,458 --> 00:38:02,250
And Robert is the son of Mr. Ledgard.

329
00:38:02,625 --> 00:38:07,708
Their fathers were very different
but both were born insane.

330
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,208
It's my fault.

331
00:38:18,667 --> 00:38:21,958
I've got insanity in my entrails.

332
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:25,167
I'd served at the Ledgards' house
since I was a child.

333
00:38:25,292 --> 00:38:27,583
Mrs. Ledgard was sterile...

334
00:38:28,167 --> 00:38:32,750
and when my Robert was born,
they kept him...

335
00:38:34,625 --> 00:38:37,375
and said she'd given birth to him.

336
00:38:39,417 --> 00:38:43,083
But I was the one who looked after him
from the day he was born.

337
00:38:45,208 --> 00:38:48,083
Zeca spoke to me as if he knew me.

338
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:52,417
He mistook you for Gal,
Robert's wife.

339
00:38:54,458 --> 00:38:58,208
Unlike Robert,
Zeca grew up far from me.

340
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:04,167
When he was seven,
he started transporting drugs.

341
00:39:04,292 --> 00:39:08,333
I never saw him.
He grew up on the street.

342
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:17,958
About twelve years ago
Zeca came back to the house.

343
00:39:19,042 --> 00:39:21,958
He was on the run
and asked us for shelter.

344
00:39:23,458 --> 00:39:25,708
I hid him in an outhouse,
but Gal found him...

345
00:39:26,542 --> 00:39:29,667
she took a fancy to him...

346
00:39:29,833 --> 00:39:32,292
and they ended up
running away together.

347
00:39:34,583 --> 00:39:37,042
Their car crashed,

348
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:39,875
Zeca survived and ran away.

349
00:39:41,625 --> 00:39:43,542
But she...

350
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:52,833
Robert found her, horribly burned,
but still with a flicker of life.

351
00:39:56,583 --> 00:40:00,292
He snatched her back from death
at the last minute.

352
00:40:02,583 --> 00:40:08,208
He worked day and night.
He did endless research.

353
00:40:08,625 --> 00:40:10,208
He didn't sleep.

354
00:40:12,583 --> 00:40:16,917
He only rested when he sat
by the bed where she was lying...

355
00:40:17,042 --> 00:40:19,458
covered with gauzes.

356
00:40:20,417 --> 00:40:24,250
He was intoxicated
by the smell of burned flesh.

357
00:40:25,792 --> 00:40:28,625
After the accident,
we lived like vampires...

358
00:40:30,458 --> 00:40:33,667
in total darkness and with no mirrors.

359
00:40:36,208 --> 00:40:38,500
To everyone's surprise...

360
00:40:38,625 --> 00:40:41,625
after several endless months,
Gal started to improve.

361
00:40:43,708 --> 00:40:46,875
The things that a madman's love can do!

362
00:40:51,667 --> 00:40:53,833
One day...

363
00:40:55,375 --> 00:40:58,708
whe she could finally stand unaided...

364
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:03,958
Gal heard Norma's voice in the distance...

365
00:41:04,667 --> 00:41:08,375
singing a song that she had taught her.

366
00:41:10,708 --> 00:41:13,375
And she got emotional.

367
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:20,333
For the first time in many months,
she got emotional.

368
00:41:21,583 --> 00:41:23,083
And it was...

369
00:41:23,917 --> 00:41:27,208
like feeling she was alive again.

370
00:42:04,083 --> 00:42:06,750
When she opened the window...

371
00:42:08,292 --> 00:42:12,333
she suddenly saw her image
reflected in the glass.

372
00:42:20,292 --> 00:42:23,167
She didn't look human.

373
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:26,167
She was a cinder.

374
00:42:29,917 --> 00:42:32,542
She gave a scream
that echoed through the house...

375
00:42:32,708 --> 00:42:34,875
and threw herself out the window.

376
00:42:47,458 --> 00:42:50,458
Years later, little Norma...

377
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:54,542
went in search of her mother...

378
00:42:55,792 --> 00:42:59,708
along the same road
her mother had taken.

379
00:43:02,625 --> 00:43:04,792
Through the window.

380
00:43:44,417 --> 00:43:47,625
- What did you do with the body?
- I buried it well.

381
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:49,250
Did you pray?

382
00:43:49,333 --> 00:43:52,583
Yes.
Everything you told me.

383
00:43:57,792 --> 00:43:59,667
Shall we go inside?

384
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:41,042
Do you mind if we
leave it

385
00:44:41,125 --> 00:44:42,750
for tomorrow?

386
00:44:44,208 --> 00:44:47,208
The tiger really messed me up.

387
00:44:48,042 --> 00:44:49,875
As you wish.

388
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:55,375
But hold me!

389
00:45:02,375 --> 00:45:04,875
Don't worry, I'll wait.

390
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:08,625
I don't want you to feel uncomfortable.

391
00:45:09,083 --> 00:45:10,625
Thank you!

392
00:45:26,125 --> 00:45:28,500
I'm falling asleep.

393
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,042
Sleep, my love.

394
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:00,250
SIX YEARS EARLIER

395
00:46:32,458 --> 00:46:34,833
Thank you.
I owe this wedding to you.

396
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:37,542
Don't exaggerate.
Nico adores you.

397
00:46:39,958 --> 00:46:42,583
Without your help, he'd adore me less.

398
00:46:42,708 --> 00:46:45,125
- Congratulations!
- Thank you.

399
00:46:51,875 --> 00:46:54,750
Your daughter is getting on well
with my neices.

400
00:46:55,458 --> 00:46:57,208
She seems much better...

401
00:46:57,375 --> 00:47:00,083
At least she isn't afraid of people now.

402
00:47:00,667 --> 00:47:03,792
Yes, it's odd she hasn't come
to ask if we can leave.

403
00:47:03,875 --> 00:47:07,208
She's great!
And she's having a wonderful time.

404
00:47:21,125 --> 00:47:22,625
To you!

405
00:48:14,042 --> 00:48:16,583
You've had him long enough,
it's my turn.

406
00:48:16,625 --> 00:48:18,250
Enjoy him, darling.

407
00:48:30,792 --> 00:48:32,208
Excuse me.

408
00:50:41,542 --> 00:50:43,208
Norma!

409
00:50:43,333 --> 00:50:44,875
Norma!

410
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:47,042
Norma!

411
00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:48,875
Norma!

412
00:50:49,042 --> 00:50:50,625
Norma!

413
00:50:50,833 --> 00:50:54,292
Sweetheart, it's me!

414
00:50:59,208 --> 00:51:01,708
There, there!

415
00:52:09,792 --> 00:52:11,000
What about this one?

416
00:52:11,083 --> 00:52:12,292
Yes, but...

417
00:52:12,375 --> 00:52:13,542
no.

418
00:52:13,667 --> 00:52:14,792
And it looks a bit old.

419
00:52:14,875 --> 00:52:17,083
It's not old, it's vintage.

420
00:52:17,167 --> 00:52:19,625
- Maybe something flowery?
- No, no flowers.

421
00:52:19,708 --> 00:52:22,208
No flowers.
Something like this?

422
00:52:22,333 --> 00:52:23,833
Not stripes either.

423
00:52:23,958 --> 00:52:25,333
No stripes.

424
00:52:36,542 --> 00:52:38,083
Something graphic?

425
00:52:38,208 --> 00:52:40,833
Graphic?
Like this?

426
00:52:40,875 --> 00:52:42,833
I'll come back another day.

427
00:52:42,917 --> 00:52:46,042
Yes, do that, you're dopey today.

428
00:52:49,917 --> 00:52:51,083
Cristina...

429
00:52:52,083 --> 00:52:54,083
Here. On the house.

430
00:52:54,167 --> 00:52:56,083
Put it on and we'll go partying.

431
00:52:56,208 --> 00:52:57,750
I'm meeting my girlfriend.

432
00:52:57,917 --> 00:53:00,500
Put it on anyway.
I'd like to see you in it.

433
00:53:02,125 --> 00:53:04,208
It'll look great on you.

434
00:53:04,333 --> 00:53:06,333
If you like it so much, wear it yourself.

435
00:53:07,458 --> 00:53:09,167
You're so mistaken!

436
00:53:09,250 --> 00:53:11,167
Because I don't like men?

437
00:53:11,417 --> 00:53:13,542
Because you don't like me.

438
00:53:14,208 --> 00:53:15,792
In any case...

439
00:53:16,250 --> 00:53:19,625
I've got pills to get you in the mood.

440
00:53:19,750 --> 00:53:21,792
You shouldn't take that shit.

441
00:53:24,958 --> 00:53:27,042
Vicente, leave Cristina alone!

442
00:53:27,833 --> 00:53:29,375
I'm off.

443
00:53:29,833 --> 00:53:31,208
Where to?

444
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:32,708
Home, to get changed.

445
00:53:32,792 --> 00:53:34,042
How come?

446
00:53:34,625 --> 00:53:35,667
I'm meeting my pals.

447
00:53:35,750 --> 00:53:38,292
I think we're going to Casilda's party.

448
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:39,542
Were you invited?

449
00:53:39,625 --> 00:53:41,708
Jorge knows one of the neices.

450
00:53:41,792 --> 00:53:43,542
We're just going to the dance.

451
00:53:44,417 --> 00:53:46,833
Well? Are you coming?

452
00:53:47,083 --> 00:53:49,250
Leave her alone, you pain.

453
00:53:51,167 --> 00:53:52,500
Good afternoon.

454
00:53:52,667 --> 00:53:54,125
Hello.

455
00:53:55,458 --> 00:53:57,583
My wife has left us...

456
00:53:57,667 --> 00:54:00,208
and I was wondering
if you'd want her clothes.

457
00:54:01,042 --> 00:54:03,250
- Josefina?
- Yes.

458
00:54:04,792 --> 00:54:06,167
Well...

459
00:54:06,375 --> 00:54:08,583
we don't have anything for fat women...

460
00:54:10,125 --> 00:54:14,792
If you're interested,
I'll let you check them out.

461
00:54:14,875 --> 00:54:16,542
They're very nice.

462
00:54:16,875 --> 00:54:18,875
We'll look at them and let you know.

463
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:22,583
- Of course.
- It's this, right?

464
00:54:22,625 --> 00:54:23,583
Yes.
It's heavy.

465
00:54:23,667 --> 00:54:25,083
It certainly is.

466
00:54:25,167 --> 00:54:26,542
But...

467
00:54:26,958 --> 00:54:29,250
did she leave or has she disappeared?

468
00:54:29,458 --> 00:54:31,417
Both things.
To be honest...

469
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:34,500
she does it regularly.
We're used to it.

470
00:54:34,583 --> 00:54:36,292
So the next time she does it...

471
00:54:36,375 --> 00:54:39,458
she'll have to leave naked
because I'm selling her clothes.

472
00:55:25,667 --> 00:55:28,167
I'll show you the garden.

473
00:55:28,250 --> 00:55:31,000
What a party!

474
00:55:31,125 --> 00:55:32,583
Fresh air!

475
00:55:34,333 --> 00:55:37,375
You're all stoners!

476
00:55:40,542 --> 00:55:42,250
I'm Vicente.

477
00:55:43,125 --> 00:55:44,708
I'm Norma.

478
00:55:48,833 --> 00:55:50,625
Your friends have gone.

479
00:55:51,833 --> 00:55:54,125
All the better, right?

480
00:56:07,292 --> 00:56:08,792
Are you stoned?

481
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:10,917
Stoned?

482
00:56:11,417 --> 00:56:13,375
Have you taken any pills?

483
00:56:14,083 --> 00:56:15,875
Yes.

484
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:18,500
Cipralex 20...

485
00:56:19,458 --> 00:56:22,292
100 mg of Deprax...

486
00:56:23,583 --> 00:56:25,667
2 g of Trankimazin.

487
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:27,417
I don't take Rohipnol now.

488
00:56:27,792 --> 00:56:30,250
And Lyrica, of course.

489
00:56:30,375 --> 00:56:31,667
Shit!

490
00:56:31,792 --> 00:56:33,750
I'm high as hell too.

491
00:56:33,875 --> 00:56:35,208
High?

492
00:56:35,667 --> 00:56:37,083
Yes.

493
00:56:42,083 --> 00:56:44,000
You're not from here, are you?

494
00:56:44,125 --> 00:56:46,208
No. Are you?

495
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:49,125
Yes, but I want to get away...

496
00:57:08,167 --> 00:57:10,958
I'm sick of these high heels!

497
00:57:16,875 --> 00:57:18,458
And this jacket!

498
00:57:19,958 --> 00:57:23,875
All these clothes give me claustrophobia.

499
00:57:24,292 --> 00:57:28,083
If I could, I'd go naked all the time.

500
00:57:30,333 --> 00:57:31,625
Wait.

501
00:57:32,625 --> 00:57:34,333
I'll leave you naked.

502
00:58:14,625 --> 00:58:16,375
You're so pretty...

503
00:58:18,250 --> 00:58:19,792
and different.

504
00:58:21,958 --> 00:58:23,667
I'm different too.

505
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:26,125
Are you in treatment too?

506
00:58:27,917 --> 00:58:29,000
No.

507
00:58:29,083 --> 00:58:31,125
Do you think I should be?

508
00:58:31,208 --> 00:58:32,625
I don't know.

509
00:58:33,292 --> 00:58:36,833
And now, on the groom's request,
I'm going to sing...

510
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,333
"I Need To Love".

511
00:58:38,417 --> 00:58:40,375
This is also for the bride...

512
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:42,250
with all my affection.

513
00:59:41,750 --> 00:59:47,042
No!

514
00:59:51,917 --> 00:59:53,958
Shut up!

515
00:59:56,417 --> 00:59:58,583
Stop!

516
01:01:32,875 --> 01:01:34,417
Cristina...

517
01:01:34,542 --> 01:01:37,792
If I left, you'd stay here
with my mother, wouldn't you?

518
01:01:38,083 --> 01:01:39,458
Yes...

519
01:01:39,542 --> 01:01:41,333
but where are you going?

520
01:01:41,417 --> 01:01:44,375
I don't know.
I'm sick of the town.

521
01:01:44,542 --> 01:01:46,125
That's because of all the stuff you take.

522
01:01:46,167 --> 01:01:47,667
I haven't taken anything in a week.

523
01:01:47,750 --> 01:01:49,375
Then it's because of that.

524
01:01:50,125 --> 01:01:52,250
So should I take it or not?

525
01:01:52,292 --> 01:01:53,833
It's best not to.

526
01:01:55,750 --> 01:01:57,292
I'm going out.

527
01:01:57,750 --> 01:01:59,667
Now? Without finishing it?

528
01:01:59,708 --> 01:02:00,667
Yes.

529
01:02:03,167 --> 01:02:05,958
Are you coming for supper
or will you be late?

530
01:02:06,042 --> 01:02:08,750
I'll be home for supper,
I just need some air.

531
01:02:08,792 --> 01:02:11,833
Leave it mom, I can do it.
Pass me my helmet.

532
01:02:13,083 --> 01:02:15,125
Are you leaving that mess?

533
01:02:15,167 --> 01:02:17,625
I'll finish it tomorrow.

534
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,208
What are you doing, asshole?
Are you crazy?

535
01:03:56,125 --> 01:03:57,750
Son of a bitch!

536
01:03:58,667 --> 01:04:01,083
Bastard!

537
01:04:09,250 --> 01:04:10,792
Are you crazy?

538
01:04:11,042 --> 01:04:14,208
Don't shoot!

539
01:06:10,250 --> 01:06:12,375
Help!

540
01:06:16,542 --> 01:06:18,042
<i>Help!

541
01:06:30,375 --> 01:06:31,792
Come in.

542
01:06:33,750 --> 01:06:35,083
Sit down, please.

543
01:06:37,042 --> 01:06:38,458
Thank you.

544
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:42,500
I was told there's news.

545
01:06:43,667 --> 01:06:48,083
We found the bike, totally destroyed,
at the Finisterre cliffs.

546
01:06:49,750 --> 01:06:51,333
And the body?

547
01:06:51,750 --> 01:06:53,083
Nothing.

548
01:06:53,583 --> 01:06:55,750
It must have been washed out to sea.

549
01:07:00,333 --> 01:07:02,125
We're very sorry, ma'am.

550
01:07:03,333 --> 01:07:05,042
My son is alive.

551
01:07:06,708 --> 01:07:09,875
- As we said...
- Yes, you found the bike...

552
01:07:09,917 --> 01:07:11,542
but my son?

553
01:07:13,042 --> 01:07:15,542
He could have been kidnapped.

554
01:07:18,208 --> 01:07:21,583
Until his body appears,
you must keep looking, please!

555
01:07:21,667 --> 01:07:23,625
We've talked about this already, ma'am.

556
01:07:23,708 --> 01:07:27,750
You have to keep looking.
My son is alive!

557
01:07:27,833 --> 01:07:30,417
If he is, he's far away.

558
01:07:32,583 --> 01:07:35,792
All his friends that were questioned,
even your assistant...

559
01:07:35,875 --> 01:07:39,083
all say he was fed up and wanted to leave.

560
01:07:39,125 --> 01:07:40,875
But he said he'd be home for supper.

561
01:07:40,917 --> 01:07:42,250
Cristina heard him.

562
01:07:42,417 --> 01:07:45,875
If he didn't call me,
it's because something happened.

563
01:08:03,167 --> 01:08:05,125
NEUROPSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE

564
01:08:19,750 --> 01:08:23,458
It's me, Norma.
It's dad.

565
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:28,583
Norma...

566
01:08:30,458 --> 01:08:31,500
Sweetheart...

567
01:08:31,542 --> 01:08:32,792
Sweetheart...

568
01:08:32,875 --> 01:08:35,833
I won't touch you.

569
01:08:38,125 --> 01:08:39,708
Where are you going?

570
01:08:46,625 --> 01:08:48,333
Where are you going?

571
01:08:56,292 --> 01:08:58,375
Norma, love.

572
01:09:02,875 --> 01:09:03,958
Everything OK?

573
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,417
Yes.

574
01:09:11,042 --> 01:09:12,792
It's me, Norma.

575
01:09:12,875 --> 01:09:15,208
You can come out,
the men have gone.

576
01:09:15,333 --> 01:09:19,375
Can't you put her in a dress?
In that gown she looks worse than she is.

577
01:09:19,458 --> 01:09:20,958
We tried...

578
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:24,625
but she can't stand
any kind of fitted clothing.

579
01:09:24,708 --> 01:09:26,375
She rips it off.

580
01:09:28,167 --> 01:09:32,250
Dr. Ledgard, I don't think
you should visit her so often.

581
01:09:33,375 --> 01:09:36,667
- She's my daughter!
- But she doesn't recognize you.

582
01:09:36,833 --> 01:09:38,917
And she gets worse when she sees you.

583
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:42,042
In her mind,
she's convinced you attacked her.

584
01:09:42,167 --> 01:09:43,542
I just found her lying there!

585
01:09:43,625 --> 01:09:46,000
Why can't you get that into her head?

586
01:09:46,083 --> 01:09:48,833
She identifies you with the rapist.

587
01:09:49,917 --> 01:09:51,208
Maybe...

588
01:09:51,292 --> 01:09:54,167
we let her out too soon.

589
01:09:54,333 --> 01:09:56,958
It was your idea
that she should socialize.

590
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,625
She was getting over her social phobia.

591
01:09:59,750 --> 01:10:00,792
How could I know...

592
01:10:00,833 --> 01:10:03,792
someone would try to
rape her while she was with you.

593
01:11:29,792 --> 01:11:34,667
Over here!
Please! Get me out of here!

594
01:11:34,750 --> 01:11:37,667
Help!
Get me out of here!

595
01:11:38,833 --> 01:11:42,417
I'm thirsty and I'm starving.

596
01:11:42,833 --> 01:11:44,625
You'll eat and drink now.

597
01:11:44,708 --> 01:11:47,833
I haven't done anything!
This is a mistake!

598
01:11:47,958 --> 01:11:51,042
Possibly.
Everyone makes mistakes.

599
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,792
Come over here, you bastard,
and set me free!

600
01:12:06,208 --> 01:12:07,583
Turn around!

601
01:12:38,542 --> 01:12:41,083
I'm chaining you nearer to the table.

602
01:12:41,208 --> 01:12:44,500
But, why?
I haven't done anything.

603
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:47,625
You'll be more comfortable there.

604
01:13:24,875 --> 01:13:26,375
Eat.

605
01:13:27,792 --> 01:13:29,208
Thank you!

606
01:13:35,208 --> 01:13:37,458
Sorry if I annoyed you the other day.

607
01:13:38,292 --> 01:13:40,750
I've been alone for so long.

608
01:13:43,625 --> 01:13:46,833
Wait, please! Don't go!

609
01:13:50,875 --> 01:13:53,042
Please, don't go!

610
01:13:53,208 --> 01:13:55,250
We have to talk.

611
01:14:23,208 --> 01:14:24,667
My condolences.

612
01:14:28,167 --> 01:14:30,167
We did what we could.

613
01:14:30,458 --> 01:14:32,958
It wasn't enough
and you did it very badly.

614
01:14:33,083 --> 01:14:34,958
I'm going to report the hospital,
and you in particular...

615
01:14:35,042 --> 01:14:36,667
for homicidal negligence.

616
01:14:36,708 --> 01:14:39,458
- Please, this isn't the place.
- Please...

617
01:14:43,167 --> 01:14:45,000
You really want to work today?

618
01:14:45,083 --> 01:14:46,250
Yes.

619
01:14:46,375 --> 01:14:49,500
You should rest and try to forget.

620
01:14:49,583 --> 01:14:52,667
I couldn't sleep, and working
will keep my mind occupied.

621
01:14:52,750 --> 01:14:55,250
- Call the whole team.
- OK.

622
01:15:13,375 --> 01:15:15,375
My mother will be very worried.

623
01:15:16,125 --> 01:15:18,625
I never stay away without calling her.

624
01:15:28,542 --> 01:15:30,625
You have a daughter, haven't you?

625
01:15:36,708 --> 01:15:38,458
Why do you say that?

626
01:15:40,042 --> 01:15:41,958
The toys...

627
01:15:42,042 --> 01:15:43,792
My daughter is dead.

628
01:15:45,583 --> 01:15:48,167
We buried her today.

629
01:15:50,750 --> 01:15:52,667
I'm sorry.

630
01:16:01,750 --> 01:16:04,417
And now, some aftershave.

631
01:16:07,125 --> 01:16:09,167
Why did you shave me?

632
01:16:09,625 --> 01:16:11,625
That's a good question.

633
01:17:05,042 --> 01:17:06,042
Yes?

634
01:17:06,083 --> 01:17:07,458
<i>It's us.

635
01:17:07,583 --> 01:17:09,000
I'll let you in.

636
01:17:28,125 --> 01:17:29,708
If he says we're late,

637
01:17:29,750 --> 01:17:32,000
say there were two
accidents on the road

638
01:17:32,250 --> 01:17:34,125
You know how he is about punctuality.

639
01:17:37,583 --> 01:17:39,208
Good evening.

640
01:17:39,292 --> 01:17:40,625
You're late.

641
01:17:40,792 --> 01:17:42,625
There were two accidents on the road.

642
01:17:43,042 --> 01:17:45,708
Here's the paperwork and envelopes.

643
01:17:45,792 --> 01:17:48,125
When you're ready, we'll start.

644
01:17:48,625 --> 01:17:52,500
Two accidents, one near that town...

645
01:18:33,292 --> 01:18:36,792
He's very young.
He looks like a boy.

646
01:18:37,583 --> 01:18:39,292
He isn't.

647
01:18:40,042 --> 01:18:43,208
He's 27 and he knows
exactly what he wants.

648
01:18:43,333 --> 01:18:46,333
It's a particularly confidential case.

649
01:19:21,833 --> 01:19:23,792
What's happened?

650
01:19:28,417 --> 01:19:30,375
What did you do to me?

651
01:19:31,042 --> 01:19:33,292
A vaginoplasty

652
01:19:42,583 --> 01:19:44,458
No...

653
01:20:31,333 --> 01:20:33,958
Listen carefully to what I'm going to say.

654
01:20:34,042 --> 01:20:35,667
It's very important.

655
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:41,333
As you've just seen,
the operation was successful...

656
01:20:41,542 --> 01:20:46,292
but the tissues of the vagina are still
very tender and could stick together.

657
01:20:46,375 --> 01:20:49,542
But don't worry,
it's easy to prevent that.

658
01:20:49,792 --> 01:20:51,083
You...

659
01:20:52,375 --> 01:20:55,208
You have to keep the new orifice open...

660
01:20:55,292 --> 01:20:58,667
and manage, bit by bit, to make it deeper.

661
01:20:59,792 --> 01:21:04,417
Think that your life
depends on that orifice...

662
01:21:04,500 --> 01:21:06,875
that you breathe through it.

663
01:21:08,583 --> 01:21:09,958
In this case...

664
01:21:11,542 --> 01:21:14,750
there are several dilators
of different sizes.

665
01:21:17,250 --> 01:21:21,625
Start by inserting the smallest one.

666
01:21:23,958 --> 01:21:26,208
It will hurt at first...

667
01:21:27,042 --> 01:21:29,583
but in a few months...

668
01:21:29,708 --> 01:21:32,792
the largest one will fit without any effort...

669
01:21:32,917 --> 01:21:34,625
and the skin...

670
01:21:34,792 --> 01:21:38,875
will be perfectly healed.

671
01:21:47,333 --> 01:21:50,958
This is very good.

672
01:21:52,750 --> 01:21:55,208
How long have you been using
the last dilator?

673
01:21:55,292 --> 01:21:56,958
Four weeks.

674
01:21:57,292 --> 01:21:58,833
Can I go now?

675
01:21:59,250 --> 01:22:01,833
- Go where?
- Home.

676
01:22:02,333 --> 01:22:04,292
But we've just started.

677
01:22:19,208 --> 01:22:21,167
What else are you going to do?

678
01:22:23,208 --> 01:22:25,833
You'll see, when the time comes.

679
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,292
Why are you doing this?

680
01:22:38,167 --> 01:22:40,708
Do you remember
Casilda Efraiz's wedding?

681
01:22:41,875 --> 01:22:44,417
In that spectacular house?

682
01:22:45,792 --> 01:22:50,042
I'm Norma's father.
She was the child you raped.

683
01:22:51,625 --> 01:22:53,667
I don't think I actually raped her.

684
01:22:53,708 --> 01:22:58,042
You "don't think"?
Have you lost your memory?

685
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:03,875
I'd taken a lot of pills
and I can hardly remember it.

686
01:23:03,917 --> 01:23:08,458
Well I didn't take anything
and I'll never forget it!

687
01:23:08,542 --> 01:23:10,333
What are you going to do now?

688
01:23:31,375 --> 01:23:35,167
It's a pity you can't see your whole body.

689
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:42,458
They don't seem pneumatic now, do they?

690
01:23:42,542 --> 01:23:46,750
They're like drops of water
sliding along a glass surface.

691
01:23:55,583 --> 01:23:58,458
The marks on your skin will disappear.

692
01:23:59,083 --> 01:24:01,542
There's still work to do.

693
01:24:02,625 --> 01:24:07,083
But to put you mind at ease,
there'll be no more burns.

694
01:24:09,833 --> 01:24:14,583
I've bought you this body stocking.
It'll protect your skin.

695
01:24:14,667 --> 01:24:18,000
It'll also give you support
and mold you.

696
01:24:18,667 --> 01:24:22,958
Get used to wearing it all the time...

697
01:24:24,250 --> 01:24:25,750
like a second skin.

698
01:24:27,167 --> 01:24:28,708
Put it on.

699
01:25:14,208 --> 01:25:16,500
Will you zip me up, please?

700
01:25:36,958 --> 01:25:38,292
Bitch!

701
01:26:26,917 --> 01:26:28,292
Stop!

702
01:26:29,583 --> 01:26:32,083
Give me the key
or I'll come up and stab you!

703
01:26:34,208 --> 01:26:35,917
Stay where you are!

704
01:26:51,792 --> 01:26:53,625
I'll slit my throat...

705
01:26:53,667 --> 01:26:55,750
and then you'll have no toy!

706
01:26:56,917 --> 01:26:58,667
You wouldn't dare.

707
01:27:33,667 --> 01:27:35,458
We were lucky.

708
01:27:37,208 --> 01:27:39,000
SEVERAL WEEKS LATER

709
01:28:22,917 --> 01:28:25,708
I can't keep calling you Vicente.

710
01:28:28,708 --> 01:28:33,042
From today, your name is Vera.

711
01:30:20,167 --> 01:30:22,583
I don't know if you're there.

712
01:30:22,667 --> 01:30:25,083
I'm returning the makeup book
and the makeup.

713
01:30:25,167 --> 01:30:26,833
Do what you want with them.

714
01:30:49,625 --> 01:30:52,208
<i>...and you can practice it anywhere...

715
01:30:52,250 --> 01:30:55,125
<i>on a hospital bed, in jail.

716
01:31:15,708 --> 01:31:18,917
<i>There's a place where you can take refuge...

717
01:31:19,375 --> 01:31:22,167
<i>a place inside you...

718
01:31:22,250 --> 01:31:24,042
<i>a place to which...

719
01:31:24,125 --> 01:31:26,458
<i>no one else has access...

720
01:31:26,500 --> 01:31:29,167
<i>a place that no one can destroy.

721
01:31:29,708 --> 01:31:32,000
<i>To access that place there is yoga...

722
01:31:32,250 --> 01:31:35,167
<i>an ancient technique.

723
01:31:36,042 --> 01:31:39,542
<i>It's a flace where you'll find peace,
where you'll find tranquility...

724
01:31:39,583 --> 01:31:41,208
<i>freedom.

725
01:31:41,333 --> 01:31:43,042
<i>But you must practice it...

726
01:31:43,125 --> 01:31:45,750
<i>continuously, intensely...

727
01:31:45,833 --> 01:31:50,167
<i>and then you'll achieve it.

728
01:31:50,625 --> 01:31:52,625
YOGA BOOKS

729
01:32:53,958 --> 01:32:55,875
My Cigarral!

730
01:32:56,708 --> 01:32:58,625
I missed it so much!

731
01:33:00,167 --> 01:33:02,875
These four years seemed eternal!

732
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:06,708
- Was it that long?
- Four years and two months.

733
01:33:07,250 --> 01:33:09,917
I tohught you'd forgotten me.

734
01:33:10,750 --> 01:33:12,458
I thought that...

735
01:33:12,625 --> 01:33:15,875
at least you'd have called me
when Norma died.

736
01:33:16,417 --> 01:33:18,583
My poor child.

737
01:33:18,833 --> 01:33:20,917
To throw herself out the window!

738
01:33:21,042 --> 01:33:23,458
I'd rather not talk about it.

739
01:33:24,125 --> 01:33:26,000
As you wish.

740
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,417
But I'm going to miss her so much!

741
01:33:31,250 --> 01:33:33,208
Let's go to the kitchen.

742
01:33:33,625 --> 01:33:35,042
I'm parched.

743
01:33:39,083 --> 01:33:41,042
Don't look at the surfaces.

744
01:33:42,833 --> 01:33:45,167
Everything has to be cleaned.

745
01:33:45,375 --> 01:33:48,917
Call the agency
and hire the help you need.

746
01:33:49,250 --> 01:33:51,625
You've installed more televisions.

747
01:33:51,750 --> 01:33:56,042
They're not televisions.
It's to control a patient.

748
01:33:56,167 --> 01:33:57,958
I'll explain.

749
01:33:58,833 --> 01:34:01,333
From now on, you'll look after her.

750
01:34:01,417 --> 01:34:05,333
But you don't have to go into her room.
She cleans it.

751
01:34:07,333 --> 01:34:11,333
- Are there more patients
- No. She's the only one.

752
01:34:32,083 --> 01:34:33,792
You've put on your uniform.

753
01:34:34,500 --> 01:34:36,958
You don't have to wear it.

754
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:38,542
I like the uniform...

755
01:34:38,667 --> 01:34:41,292
because it means we're together again.

756
01:34:49,208 --> 01:34:50,708
Who is she?

757
01:34:51,958 --> 01:34:54,083
I told you.
Her name's Vera.

758
01:34:54,875 --> 01:34:56,625
What's she doing?

759
01:34:57,500 --> 01:34:59,208
She's writing on the wall.

760
01:34:59,333 --> 01:35:01,625
I can see that.

761
01:35:03,375 --> 01:35:05,208
It smells of croquettes.

762
01:35:07,625 --> 01:35:09,833
She called me on the intercom...

763
01:35:09,958 --> 01:35:12,750
and asked who I was and what day it was.

764
01:35:13,125 --> 01:35:16,083
When I told her
she started writing on the wall.

765
01:35:17,750 --> 01:35:20,708
I don't want her
to take liberties with you.

766
01:35:21,333 --> 01:35:25,667
Don't unlock her room.
If there's a problem, call me.

767
01:35:26,500 --> 01:35:28,792
She reminds me of someone.

768
01:35:28,917 --> 01:35:32,583
All the women I've operated on
end up reminding you of someone.

769
01:35:32,708 --> 01:35:36,917
Yes, but her more so.
The face is the same.

770
01:35:48,125 --> 01:35:51,583
I BREATHE.
I KNOW I BREATHE.

771
01:36:03,917 --> 01:36:06,625
OPIUM HELPS ME FORGET.

772
01:36:19,583 --> 01:36:21,833
BACK TO THE PRESENT

773
01:36:26,458 --> 01:36:29,250
- What are you doing?
- Slicing a pineapple.

774
01:36:31,542 --> 01:36:34,167
Don't look at me like that.
I won't hurt you.

775
01:36:34,292 --> 01:36:36,083
I don't trust you.

776
01:36:36,417 --> 01:36:39,625
If you did, it would be much easier
for the three of us.

777
01:36:40,917 --> 01:36:42,458
Pass me the tray.

778
01:36:42,542 --> 01:36:45,583
No. I'll take it up.

779
01:36:50,083 --> 01:36:52,583
Just put it in the dumbwaiter.

780
01:36:53,958 --> 01:36:55,458
Thank you.

781
01:37:58,000 --> 01:37:59,750
Good morning.

782
01:38:05,542 --> 01:38:07,250
Breakfast.

783
01:38:10,750 --> 01:38:12,542
Thank you.

784
01:38:22,458 --> 01:38:24,333
Where's Marilia?

785
01:38:24,500 --> 01:38:26,542
In the kitchen, grumbling.

786
01:38:27,583 --> 01:38:30,917
She doesn't like anyone else
looking after you.

787
01:38:41,417 --> 01:38:43,083
Last night...

788
01:38:43,917 --> 01:38:45,792
before we went to bed...

789
01:38:45,917 --> 01:38:48,833
we talked alot and we made a promise.

790
01:38:50,375 --> 01:38:53,667
- Or did I dream it?
- You didn't dream it.

791
01:38:55,625 --> 01:38:58,750
You promised me that
there'd be no more locked doors...

792
01:38:59,542 --> 01:39:02,167
that I could see all the TV channels...

793
01:39:03,333 --> 01:39:05,458
that I was free.

794
01:39:07,583 --> 01:39:10,625
And I promised you
that I'd never leave you.

795
01:39:11,875 --> 01:39:13,833
Don't let me down.

796
01:39:14,417 --> 01:39:16,875
It's all I have, Robert.

797
01:39:17,500 --> 01:39:19,750
Your promise and mine.

798
01:39:29,125 --> 01:39:31,875
Have you really thought
about what we're going to do?

799
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:36,458
When we're in the streets
she could push me and run off.

800
01:39:36,542 --> 01:39:38,292
She promised not to.

801
01:39:38,375 --> 01:39:41,625
And you believe her?
You're like a child.

802
01:39:42,167 --> 01:39:46,000
You were always like that with women.
And look where it got you!

803
01:39:46,042 --> 01:39:47,625
That's enough!

804
01:39:50,667 --> 01:39:52,917
I'm sorry I took so long.

805
01:39:53,833 --> 01:39:56,833
I've put on high heels to practice.

806
01:39:57,292 --> 01:40:00,750
Buy whatever you like.
Marilia has the cards.

807
01:40:00,917 --> 01:40:02,500
Thank you.

808
01:40:18,500 --> 01:40:20,167
Come along, child!

809
01:40:26,625 --> 01:40:28,667
Have you a problem with me?

810
01:40:29,208 --> 01:40:32,500
No, but as you can see I'm very busy.

811
01:40:34,250 --> 01:40:37,625
I want to talk about the clinic.

812
01:40:37,833 --> 01:40:39,833
I told you on the phone.

813
01:40:40,708 --> 01:40:42,333
After talking to the president...

814
01:40:42,417 --> 01:40:45,917
I decided to stop using the house as a clinic.

815
01:40:47,667 --> 01:40:50,583
But if things are done carefully,
there's no reason to worry.

816
01:40:50,667 --> 01:40:52,292
It's not just that.

817
01:40:52,583 --> 01:40:56,375
I've got other plans
that don't include operating.

818
01:40:58,083 --> 01:41:01,667
If you don't want to operate,
we'll rent the clinic from you.

819
01:41:01,750 --> 01:41:04,583
I'm speaking for all the team.

820
01:41:04,708 --> 01:41:07,542
Our main patients love the isolation here.

821
01:41:07,583 --> 01:41:11,083
I said no, Fulgencio.

822
01:41:14,917 --> 01:41:17,458
And now I'd like to be alone.

823
01:41:18,583 --> 01:41:21,750
Forgive me for not seeing you out.
You know the way.

824
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,000
Are you still here?

825
01:41:58,375 --> 01:41:59,625
I'm leaving now...

826
01:41:59,750 --> 01:42:03,417
but first I'd like you
to see today's paper.

827
01:42:07,708 --> 01:42:09,417
Vicente Guillen Pineiro.

828
01:42:09,542 --> 01:42:11,708
We gave him a sex change.

829
01:42:12,458 --> 01:42:16,083
He disappeared from his home
on September 10, 2006...

830
01:42:16,292 --> 01:42:17,417
as you can see.

831
01:42:17,542 --> 01:42:19,083
And?

832
01:42:19,792 --> 01:42:22,208
I was always surprised he wanted
to get a cunt...

833
01:42:22,458 --> 01:42:24,250
without hormones.

834
01:42:24,375 --> 01:42:26,375
He only wanted a cunt.

835
01:42:26,875 --> 01:42:30,292
He's much more muscular now
and he's working in L.A...

836
01:42:30,417 --> 01:42:33,917
in porn movies, and making a fortune.
What's this about?

837
01:42:38,292 --> 01:42:41,917
It says that his mother
is still searching desperately for him.

838
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,167
Don't go there.

839
01:42:44,292 --> 01:42:46,708
Those documents you
gave us were all false.

840
01:42:47,125 --> 01:42:48,083
It wouldn't be the first time...

841
01:42:48,167 --> 01:42:50,917
we accepted false documents.

842
01:42:51,042 --> 01:42:53,667
Why do you think
our clients prefer this place?

843
01:42:53,708 --> 01:42:56,625
- You know what I think?
- No, and I don't care.

844
01:42:57,292 --> 01:43:01,333
I think you kidnapped him...

845
01:43:01,417 --> 01:43:03,667
and you've been experimenting
on him in every sense.

846
01:43:03,958 --> 01:43:05,083
You told us...

847
01:43:05,167 --> 01:43:07,792
you'd tested your new skin
on athymic mice.

848
01:43:07,875 --> 01:43:09,667
Knowing you as I do...

849
01:43:09,750 --> 01:43:13,083
I think you'd have no scruples
about testing it on a human being.

850
01:43:13,167 --> 01:43:15,042
On Vicente, for example.

851
01:43:15,375 --> 01:43:19,292
Do you know what would happen to you...

852
01:43:19,375 --> 01:43:21,333
if the scientific community
found out you used transgenesis...

853
01:43:21,417 --> 01:43:23,458
on someone you'd kidnapped?

854
01:43:23,500 --> 01:43:26,125
I don't like threats,
they end up infecting me.

855
01:43:28,458 --> 01:43:31,000
You don't know what you're talking about.

856
01:43:34,292 --> 01:43:37,167
Get the hell out of here!

857
01:43:38,625 --> 01:43:42,417
If you're talking about me,
Dr. Roberts didn't kidnap me.

858
01:43:45,792 --> 01:43:46,750
And...

859
01:43:46,833 --> 01:43:48,792
what's that transgenesis?

860
01:43:50,167 --> 01:43:51,917
A cream?

861
01:43:54,167 --> 01:43:56,833
If I'm here it's because
I came of my own will.

862
01:43:58,083 --> 01:44:01,958
And my name isn't Vicente,
it's Vera.

863
01:44:02,292 --> 01:44:03,917
Vera Cruz!

864
01:44:05,333 --> 01:44:07,875
And I was always a woman!

865
01:44:29,958 --> 01:44:31,542
Give me a cigarette.

866
01:44:41,208 --> 01:44:42,958
Thank you.

867
01:44:43,250 --> 01:44:46,042
No, I thank you.

868
01:45:12,958 --> 01:45:14,708
Does it still hurt?

869
01:45:14,833 --> 01:45:16,417
Yes.

870
01:45:18,500 --> 01:45:20,500
Shall we do it from behind?

871
01:45:21,708 --> 01:45:24,000
Wouldn't that hurt more?

872
01:45:24,792 --> 01:45:26,542
- Wait...
- What?

873
01:45:26,625 --> 01:45:28,792
Just today I bought lubricating cream.

874
01:45:28,833 --> 01:45:31,375
- Go and get it!
- It's in my purse.

875
01:45:46,375 --> 01:45:48,542
I'm sure I put it in my new purse...

876
01:45:48,667 --> 01:45:49,833
but I can't find it.

877
01:45:49,917 --> 01:45:52,500
You must have left it downstairs.

878
01:45:52,667 --> 01:45:55,792
I'll go and get it.

879
01:46:29,417 --> 01:46:32,667
Vera!
Hurry up!

880
01:46:44,833 --> 01:46:47,917
At last!
I thought you'd gone.

881
01:46:50,417 --> 01:46:51,917
Not yet.

882
01:46:57,833 --> 01:46:59,208
Come on...

883
01:47:01,042 --> 01:47:02,667
What are you doing?

884
01:47:05,292 --> 01:47:07,125
I'm going to kill you.

885
01:47:07,583 --> 01:47:09,250
This is a joke, right?

886
01:47:10,125 --> 01:47:11,875
Call it what you want.

887
01:47:13,375 --> 01:47:15,333
But you promised!

888
01:47:15,458 --> 01:47:17,333
I lied.

889
01:47:56,708 --> 01:47:58,167
Robert?

890
01:48:00,125 --> 01:48:01,583
Robert?

891
01:48:01,708 --> 01:48:03,250
He's asleep.

892
01:48:04,542 --> 01:48:06,292
I heard a noise.

893
01:48:06,542 --> 01:48:08,083
Yes, so did I.

894
01:48:08,458 --> 01:48:11,250
Go back to bed,
it was nothing.

895
01:48:17,917 --> 01:48:19,500
Robert!

896
01:48:20,417 --> 01:48:22,083
My son!

897
01:48:33,125 --> 01:48:36,417
Come out of there! Bitch!

898
01:48:38,333 --> 01:48:40,167
Where are you?

899
01:48:55,333 --> 01:48:57,375
I knew it.

900
01:50:56,542 --> 01:50:58,167
Hello.

901
01:51:07,958 --> 01:51:09,958
You see to her.

902
01:51:12,167 --> 01:51:13,750
Good morning.

903
01:51:26,583 --> 01:51:28,417
What did you want?

904
01:51:30,292 --> 01:51:32,333
Is anything wrong?

905
01:51:33,417 --> 01:51:35,500
Are you all right?

906
01:51:39,333 --> 01:51:42,083
I don't know where to begin, Cristina.

907
01:51:44,167 --> 01:51:46,125
Do you know me?

908
01:51:46,958 --> 01:51:50,792
I'm Vicente.
I've just escaped.

909
01:51:51,833 --> 01:51:55,333
I was kidnapped.
They gave me a sex change.

910
01:51:57,750 --> 01:52:00,833
I had to kill two people to get away.

911
01:52:02,875 --> 01:52:05,042
You have to help me.

912
01:52:09,958 --> 01:52:11,667
Look.

913
01:52:12,375 --> 01:52:14,417
Do you remember this dress?

914
01:52:16,708 --> 01:52:20,792
Before Casilda's wedding,
six years ago...

915
01:52:21,125 --> 01:52:23,250
I said I'd give it to you...

916
01:52:23,667 --> 01:52:26,208
just to see how it looked.

917
01:52:26,292 --> 01:52:30,667
You said if I liked it so much,
I should wear it myself.

918
01:52:32,708 --> 01:52:37,542
At that moment we were alone, remember?

919
01:52:44,792 --> 01:52:46,875
Is anything wrong?

920
01:52:49,042 --> 01:52:51,500
Come here a moment, ma'am.

921
01:53:04,750 --> 01:53:07,458
Why are you crying?

922
01:53:18,625 --> 01:53:21,000
I'm Vicente.
