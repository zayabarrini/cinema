00:00:52,928 --> 00:00:56,891
{\an8}MADRID 2016. WINTER.

3
00:01:06,776 --> 00:01:08,568
Can you smile with your eyes?

4
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:11,989
Now relax your face,

5
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:13,949
look the other way and turn to me.

6
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:15,033
That's it.

7
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:21,081
PARALLEL MOTHERS

8
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:30,132
Rest your arms on the table.

9
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:36,221
Your chin...

10
00:01:36,305 --> 00:01:39,099
Without pressing it.
Now the other one.

11
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:41,811
Very good.

12
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:45,188
Can you smile a bit?

13
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:48,483
Look at me.

14
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:51,738
Look at the lens.

15
00:02:00,872 --> 00:02:01,748
Your coffee.

16
00:02:01,831 --> 00:02:04,166
Janis, do you want the skulls now?

17
00:02:04,917 --> 00:02:06,960
I don't know, I'll tell you later.

18
00:02:08,587 --> 00:02:10,005
Shall we sit down?

19
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:14,217
What are the skulls for?

20
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:17,470
They asked for a Hamlet pose,

21
00:02:17,678 --> 00:02:19,473
like that, with the skull.

22
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:21,224
But I think it's too obvious

23
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:24,019
to have a forensic anthropologist
with a skull.

24
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:27,774
-We're not doing it.
-I'm glad.

25
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,234
The editor said you wanted
to ask me something.

26
00:02:32,904 --> 00:02:34,029
Yes.

27
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:37,074
If you have a minute
we'll talk after the session.

28
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,785
Sure, no problem.

29
00:02:39,368 --> 00:02:42,120
I wanted to ask you
about excavating a grave.

30
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:44,874
Go ahead.

31
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:48,460
Outside my town
there's a grave with ten bodies.

32
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:50,420
One is my great-grandfather.

33
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:52,214
When the Historical Memory Law came out

34
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:54,591
the judge for my town recused himself

35
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:56,761
and since then
we haven't gotten anywhere.

36
00:02:56,844 --> 00:03:00,305
It's worse now,
they've withdrawn all the subsidies.

37
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:02,432
President Rajoy boasted in an interview

38
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:06,061
that in the State Budgets there were
zero euros for the Historical Memory.

39
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:08,105
-I read that.
-It's outrageous.

40
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,775
That's why I wanted to talk to you.

41
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:11,776
Sure.

42
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:15,028
In the Historical Memory Association
in my town,

43
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:17,865
we have a very complete dossier
of the grave.

44
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:19,449
Do you know exactly where it is?

45
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:22,787
The whole town knows,
that's why it hasn't been touched.

46
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,080
My grandmother left me all the details.

47
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:27,875
The grave is here.

48
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:31,420
They took my great-grandfather away
at the start of the war,

49
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:32,462
the first week.

50
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:34,172
How are you so sure of the place?

51
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,260
One of the victims
that Franco's soldiers buried,

52
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:41,013
Manuel Blanco Trujillo,

53
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:43,307
wasn't dead,
just badly injured.

54
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,644
At night he got out of the grave,
made it home and told everything.

55
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:50,022
Before he escaped,

56
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:54,026
he told his family where the grave was
and who was in it.

57
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:56,738
My great-grandfather.

58
00:03:56,821 --> 00:03:58,614
He was a teacher and a photographer.

59
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,033
By chance, before the war,

60
00:04:01,325 --> 00:04:03,660
he took photos of all those
who later died with him.

61
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,040
Nicasio Sanz García, the Carlist.

62
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:11,084
Facundo Nuño Tomé.

63
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:14,671
José Gutiérrez Castro
and Francisco Alonso González.

64
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:18,175
Gregorio Sánchez Muñoz, Pug-nose.

65
00:04:18,843 --> 00:04:22,764
César Cruz Arranz.
His daughter Brígida is still alive.

66
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,767
Teófilo Robles García.

67
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:29,311
Pepe Medina Sánchez
and Benito García Rodríguez.

68
00:04:30,855 --> 00:04:32,189
My grandmother.

69
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:36,109
She wrote down the names of all those
who disappeared with her father.

70
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:38,403
I'll show them to you later.

71
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:42,199
Some families are still in the town,
others aren't.

72
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,868
Some are from the next town.

73
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:47,162
All this information
makes things easier.

74
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:52,417
The association
has been saving a bit all these years.

75
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:54,336
We'd like to know

76
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:58,716
what it would cost to hire you privately
to do the excavation.

77
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,803
I'd do it for free,
but I can't do it on my own.

78
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,012
The whole town would help you.

79
00:05:04,096 --> 00:05:08,810
We need specialists
in archaeological excavations.

80
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:11,019
Pick-and-shovel workers can't do it.

81
00:05:11,103 --> 00:05:12,187
Of course not.

82
00:05:12,271 --> 00:05:16,525
Even so, the whole town
will do anything to help.

83
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:19,361
I'm improvising...

84
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:22,489
I belong to a private foundation,

85
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:26,368
the <i>Association for the Recovery
of the Historical Memory.</i>

86
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:27,912
-I knew that.
-You did?

87
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:30,163
Yes, but I didn't dare.

88
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:31,248
Some wine?

89
00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:34,209
It's a scientific foundation

90
00:05:34,293 --> 00:05:37,755
and it investigates everything to do
with our cultural roots.

91
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:40,632
Our work isn't opening graves,

92
00:05:40,925 --> 00:05:43,677
but things are so precarious
we've already intervened in one.

93
00:05:43,761 --> 00:05:45,637
It depends on where it is,
when it was,

94
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:48,515
if it gives us new information
about the war...

95
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:52,227
For example,
the fact that the one in your town

96
00:05:52,311 --> 00:05:56,023
dates from the first days of the war
is an interesting detail.

97
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:58,692
It was the night of July 25,

98
00:05:58,776 --> 00:06:01,069
according to my grandmother
and others in the town.

99
00:06:01,153 --> 00:06:04,406
You could present the project
to the foundation.

100
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:07,117
I'll make sure that
at least they consider it.

101
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:10,830
I really appreciate that.

102
00:06:10,913 --> 00:06:13,165
But it wouldn't be immediate.

103
00:06:13,248 --> 00:06:15,918
The foundation decides on its projects
years in advance,

104
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:18,253
but it's worth us trying.

105
00:06:18,337 --> 00:06:19,379
Of course.

106
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:21,965
Thank you, really.

107
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:31,183
I have to leave early,
I'm taking my husband to the doctor.

108
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:32,476
Of course.

109
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:33,644
How is he?

110
00:06:33,728 --> 00:06:35,187
A bit nervous.

111
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:39,399
Poor thing.

112
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:47,449
Yes?

113
00:06:47,742 --> 00:06:49,409
<i>Hello, Janis. How are you?</i>

114
00:06:49,744 --> 00:06:51,203
Hello, Arturo.

115
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:54,749
<i>I'm calling because the foundation
has received the dossier.</i>

116
00:06:54,832 --> 00:06:55,917
<i>They'll contact you.</i>

117
00:06:56,709 --> 00:07:00,295
I sent it all three days
after I took your photo.

118
00:07:01,505 --> 00:07:02,715
<i>Just one thing...</i>

119
00:07:02,799 --> 00:07:06,134
<i>I'll be in Madrid next week
to do an appraisal</i>

120
00:07:06,218 --> 00:07:09,304
<i>and I thought we could meet,
if it suits you.</i>

121
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:11,808
What day?

122
00:07:11,891 --> 00:07:13,392
<i>Next Wednesday.</i>

123
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:16,228
I'm free in the afternoon.

124
00:07:16,729 --> 00:07:19,481
<i>I'll see you Wednesday then.</i>

125
00:07:19,774 --> 00:07:20,858
See you then.

126
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:32,054
Breathe through your nose.

127
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:35,808
Deeply.

128
00:08:35,892 --> 00:08:37,601
Not like this...

129
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:38,895
That's worse.

130
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:47,737
That's it.

131
00:08:56,578 --> 00:08:59,957
Don't be scared.
Everything's going to be fine.

132
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:00,917
You'll see.

133
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:23,898
Are you married?

134
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:26,024
No, are you?

135
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:27,609
Me?

136
00:09:27,693 --> 00:09:29,069
No.

137
00:09:29,779 --> 00:09:32,239
So we're both single mothers.

138
00:09:33,699 --> 00:09:36,952
Mine was an accident
but I'm so happy.

139
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:41,791
Mine was an accident too.

140
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,127
I don't regret it.

141
00:09:47,714 --> 00:09:48,630
I do.

142
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:53,051
Poor thing, don't say that.

143
00:09:53,135 --> 00:09:55,596
It'll all work out, you'll see.

144
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:58,682
You're not on your own, are you?

145
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:01,853
No, I'm with my mother.

146
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:03,103
OK.

147
00:10:03,312 --> 00:10:05,147
She still hasn't gotten used to the idea.

148
00:10:05,857 --> 00:10:07,149
She will.

149
00:10:21,873 --> 00:10:23,540
Ana!

150
00:10:25,877 --> 00:10:27,085
Shouldn't you be in bed?

151
00:10:28,337 --> 00:10:32,007
It's good for her to walk,
it helps the baby drop down.

152
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:35,762
I'm Janis, her roommate.

153
00:10:35,845 --> 00:10:37,220
I'm Teresa, her mother.

154
00:10:38,347 --> 00:10:39,766
Where's the room?

155
00:10:40,349 --> 00:10:41,600
There.

156
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:43,101
Shall we go?

157
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,784
Take it slowly.

158
00:10:58,617 --> 00:11:00,369
I spoke to your father.

159
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:02,079
He can't come.

160
00:11:02,621 --> 00:11:04,164
I guessed that.

161
00:11:04,373 --> 00:11:07,459
He wishes us luck,
and you're not to worry.

162
00:11:09,503 --> 00:11:10,545
Yeah.

163
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:14,633
Here I am.

164
00:11:17,804 --> 00:11:19,806
Hello, sweetheart.

165
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:24,309
Does it hurt a lot?

166
00:11:24,643 --> 00:11:26,813
They're about to give us an epidural.

167
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:29,648
I'm dying to see Cecilia's little face.

168
00:11:29,732 --> 00:11:30,775
Me too.

169
00:11:30,858 --> 00:11:33,568
What your grandmother
would give to be here...

170
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:38,282
-That's Ana, and her mother, Teresa.
-Hello.

171
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:40,158
Elena is my best friend.

172
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:41,744
A pleasure.

173
00:11:41,828 --> 00:11:43,078
You're both almost ready, eh?

174
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:45,038
Almost, yes.

175
00:11:46,749 --> 00:11:49,626
I'm going to push...

176
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:01,388
That's good.

177
00:12:02,765 --> 00:12:05,559
Rest, breathe in.

178
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:06,935
Breathe slowly.

179
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:08,813
-I can't...
-Yes, you can.

180
00:12:08,896 --> 00:12:11,231
You're doing very well, love.

181
00:12:19,782 --> 00:12:21,491
I can see her head.

182
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:23,201
I can see her hair.

183
00:12:23,285 --> 00:12:24,453
She's got hair!

184
00:12:25,705 --> 00:12:26,748
It's amazing!

185
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:29,207
Don't be afraid, she's there.

186
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:30,626
Come on, one last push.

187
00:12:33,713 --> 00:12:35,255
One, two...

188
00:12:35,464 --> 00:12:37,633
and now push hard!

189
00:12:38,843 --> 00:12:42,471
Push hard.

190
00:12:44,181 --> 00:12:47,309
That's it, she's here now.

191
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:53,858
Hello, my darling.

192
00:12:53,941 --> 00:12:56,903
You did very well.

193
00:13:09,707 --> 00:13:12,752
There, there, my love.

194
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:19,091
Yes?

195
00:13:21,719 --> 00:13:23,929
A nurse told me you were here.

196
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:26,640
Ana! Come in and sit down.

197
00:13:27,725 --> 00:13:29,101
I'm delighted to see you.

198
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:30,895
How's your baby?

199
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:32,814
She's fine.

200
00:13:32,897 --> 00:13:34,564
She's in observation.

201
00:13:35,524 --> 00:13:37,985
They only left her on me
for a little while.

202
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:42,364
Isn't it wonderful to hear
her heart beating over yours?

203
00:13:43,741 --> 00:13:45,993
I'm longing to get her back.

204
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:48,495
Is she in observation too?

205
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:49,454
Yes.

206
00:13:49,538 --> 00:13:51,123
It must be the normal thing.

207
00:13:51,206 --> 00:13:55,127
When mine was born, she was suffering
from extrauterine inadaptation,

208
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:56,670
so the doctor told me.

209
00:13:58,422 --> 00:13:59,965
Not a great start,

210
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:02,676
because that's the life ahead of her,
extrauterine.

211
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,886
Yes.

212
00:14:03,969 --> 00:14:05,262
But apparently it's nothing.

213
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:09,558
She had trouble controlling her breathing
outside of the uterus.

214
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:12,603
What's wrong with yours?

215
00:14:12,686 --> 00:14:15,480
It seems her blood sugar was a bit low,

216
00:14:15,564 --> 00:14:17,316
but they told me too it's nothing.

217
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:19,777
I'm sure of it.

218
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:24,197
I'll give you my number
in case you want to call me.

219
00:14:24,824 --> 00:14:28,952
As we're in the same situation,
we can talk about things.

220
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:33,665
When are you getting her?

221
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:37,169
Tonight, I think, or this afternoon.

222
00:14:37,252 --> 00:14:38,503
Me too.

223
00:14:53,685 --> 00:14:55,437
The cell number is mine.

224
00:14:56,605 --> 00:14:58,858
I'm giving you the house phone, too.

225
00:15:00,651 --> 00:15:01,610
Yes?

226
00:15:02,027 --> 00:15:04,071
Hello.

227
00:15:04,154 --> 00:15:05,030
May I?

228
00:15:07,157 --> 00:15:08,826
Hello, love.

229
00:15:09,493 --> 00:15:10,870
How was the audition?

230
00:15:10,953 --> 00:15:13,163
Fantastic!

231
00:15:13,831 --> 00:15:15,792
I was there until now.

232
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:17,835
I was going to do one of the friends,

233
00:15:18,085 --> 00:15:21,380
but I asked the director
to try me out for Rosita,

234
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:24,759
which is what I'd prepared at home
without anyone asking me.

235
00:15:24,842 --> 00:15:27,511
But Doña Rosita is the lead.

236
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:28,428
Yes.

237
00:15:28,512 --> 00:15:31,306
He let me do it
and he was delighted.

238
00:15:31,515 --> 00:15:35,102
Then he asked me to read
a very difficult final scene.

239
00:15:35,185 --> 00:15:37,312
He gave me two or three indications

240
00:15:37,521 --> 00:15:42,025
and I connected immediately with that
faded, frustrated part of the character.

241
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,652
That's great, mom.

242
00:15:43,736 --> 00:15:45,362
So he told me to learn

243
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:48,198
a few more scenes
to continue with the audition tomorrow.

244
00:15:48,741 --> 00:15:50,827
I kind of ambushed him

245
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:52,912
but he liked it

246
00:15:52,995 --> 00:15:55,832
and he was surprised,
I could see it in his face.

247
00:15:56,833 --> 00:16:00,127
Can you imagine if I do Doña Rosita?

248
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:02,922
Congratulations.

249
00:16:03,005 --> 00:16:04,214
It still isn't certain.

250
00:16:04,298 --> 00:16:06,300
I know they have another actress
for the part,

251
00:16:06,383 --> 00:16:08,552
but I can always dream.

252
00:16:09,804 --> 00:16:11,430
I'm delighted for you.

253
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:12,681
Thank you, darling.

254
00:16:13,974 --> 00:16:15,517
Are you two feeling well?

255
00:16:16,435 --> 00:16:17,519
Yes.

256
00:16:19,521 --> 00:16:21,690
Croquettes, Clarissa made them.

257
00:16:22,524 --> 00:16:23,442
Where are the babies?

258
00:16:23,525 --> 00:16:25,778
They're fine, they're in observation.

259
00:16:29,406 --> 00:16:31,868
I'm off. See you tonight.

260
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:33,243
Bye, Deborah.

261
00:16:38,457 --> 00:16:40,250
I don't understand this set-up.

262
00:16:40,334 --> 00:16:43,337
She lives here like a duchess
and doesn't even help out.

263
00:16:43,545 --> 00:16:45,213
She has to study during the day.

264
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:49,259
It's the only way
to have a babysitter at night.

265
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:52,179
She goes too far, that Deborah.

266
00:16:52,262 --> 00:16:54,097
And she eats like a horse.

267
00:16:54,181 --> 00:16:55,349
No!

268
00:16:55,432 --> 00:16:57,894
If you see her using the mobile a lot,
tell me.

269
00:16:57,976 --> 00:16:58,811
It's non-stop.

270
00:16:58,895 --> 00:17:00,979
You'll wear out my finger.

271
00:17:06,151 --> 00:17:07,653
Isn't she beautiful!

272
00:17:07,737 --> 00:17:09,864
Be careful, I've just got her to sleep.

273
00:17:09,947 --> 00:17:11,990
Yes, yes. I'll see you tonight.

274
00:17:12,074 --> 00:17:13,701
Call if you need me.

275
00:17:15,577 --> 00:17:18,080
I'm amazed they've given her the part.

276
00:17:18,163 --> 00:17:20,290
I think she really overacts.

277
00:17:20,374 --> 00:17:21,793
She's very happy.

278
00:17:23,961 --> 00:17:26,254
Every day that passed was

279
00:17:26,338 --> 00:17:29,966
like an intimate garment
that was torn from my body.

280
00:17:31,342 --> 00:17:33,262
And today a friend marries

281
00:17:33,678 --> 00:17:35,055
and another

282
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:36,974
and another,

283
00:17:37,725 --> 00:17:39,769
and tomorrow she has a child

284
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:41,771
and he grows,

285
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:44,356
and she comes to show you
his exam results,

286
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:49,319
and they make new houses and new songs,

287
00:17:49,821 --> 00:17:51,613
and I am the same,

288
00:17:52,322 --> 00:17:54,449
with the same trembling,

289
00:17:55,827 --> 00:17:57,160
the same.

290
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:00,205
And one day

291
00:18:00,289 --> 00:18:04,084
I'm out walking and I realize
that I don't know anyone.

292
00:18:05,127 --> 00:18:08,380
Boys and girls who leave me behind

293
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:10,340
because I get tired.

294
00:18:11,258 --> 00:18:15,805
And one says: "That's the old maid".

295
00:18:17,222 --> 00:18:23,061
And another, handsome, with curly hair,
who comments:

296
00:18:24,271 --> 00:18:27,482
"No one would want to touch her now".

297
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:31,987
And I hear him

298
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:35,073
and I can only shout:

299
00:18:35,825 --> 00:18:37,993
"Let's keep going",

300
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,996
with a mouth full of poison

301
00:18:41,914 --> 00:18:44,666
and an enormous desire to run away,

302
00:18:45,752 --> 00:18:48,086
to take off my shoes,

303
00:18:50,882 --> 00:18:53,050
to rest

304
00:18:54,426 --> 00:18:56,470
and not move again,

305
00:18:58,263 --> 00:18:59,389
ever,

306
00:19:01,266 --> 00:19:02,852
from my corner.

307
00:19:07,899 --> 00:19:09,859
You're ready to open, Teresa.

308
00:19:09,942 --> 00:19:11,151
Thank you.

309
00:19:11,234 --> 00:19:12,444
We've finished for today.

310
00:19:13,362 --> 00:19:17,115
About the opening,
it's the same date, but not in Madrid.

311
00:19:17,199 --> 00:19:18,200
Why's that?

312
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:21,370
The theater still won't be free by then.

313
00:19:21,453 --> 00:19:23,790
We'll do a small tour of the provinces.

314
00:19:23,873 --> 00:19:26,124
During the week
I'll have more information.

315
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:27,752
So we're postponing the opening?

316
00:19:27,835 --> 00:19:30,087
No, we'll just open outside.

317
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:32,339
In Bilbao or Valencia,
they'll let us know.

318
00:19:32,422 --> 00:19:35,926
It'll be good to open in Madrid
with the play smoothed out.

319
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:38,136
You could have told us sooner.

320
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:41,766
I've got things for next month
here in Madrid.

321
00:19:41,849 --> 00:19:44,601
I've just heard,
and you've got time to get organized.

322
00:19:44,811 --> 00:19:46,979
-But I can't leave Madrid.
-We'll talk now.

323
00:19:47,521 --> 00:19:49,606
I'll give you details
of the tour tomorrow.

324
00:19:49,816 --> 00:19:52,109
If you have any problem,
now's the time to sort it out.

325
00:19:52,902 --> 00:19:55,112
See you tomorrow.

326
00:19:58,573 --> 00:20:00,409
I can't leave.

327
00:20:00,492 --> 00:20:03,537
My adolescent daughter is at home
with her newborn baby.

328
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,205
I can't leave them.

329
00:20:05,289 --> 00:20:07,374
You have to sort it out,
that's how theater is.

330
00:20:07,457 --> 00:20:09,209
You told me we'd open in Madrid.

331
00:20:09,293 --> 00:20:11,169
But that's impossible.
I'm sorry.

332
00:20:13,005 --> 00:20:14,589
I'll see what I can do,

333
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,258
but I don't know.

334
00:20:23,932 --> 00:20:25,434
Ana,

335
00:20:25,517 --> 00:20:28,353
the theater where we were going
to open in Madrid isn't free.

336
00:20:28,437 --> 00:20:30,147
They've just told me

337
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:32,608
that we'll tour
the provinces for a few months.

338
00:20:32,691 --> 00:20:33,735
A few months?

339
00:20:33,942 --> 00:20:35,193
Yes.

340
00:20:36,278 --> 00:20:37,654
It's breaking my heart.

341
00:20:37,739 --> 00:20:39,364
I don't want to leave you,

342
00:20:39,448 --> 00:20:42,451
but I've waited my whole life
for a chance like this.

343
00:20:42,534 --> 00:20:44,369
It could change my career.

344
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:49,166
But if you ask me to stay,
I'll stay.

345
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:51,043
You know I won't ask you that.

346
00:20:52,586 --> 00:20:56,298
What if we call your father and tell him
you're going back to the town?

347
00:20:56,381 --> 00:20:58,342
He'll be delighted.

348
00:20:58,425 --> 00:20:59,761
To have me and the baby?

349
00:20:59,968 --> 00:21:02,262
Don't be ridiculous, please.

350
00:21:02,346 --> 00:21:04,973
If I leave the company,
I'll never work again.

351
00:21:05,557 --> 00:21:07,517
And I won't be away all the time.

352
00:21:07,601 --> 00:21:11,188
Monday to Wednesday we don't work,
unless we're in Barcelona.

353
00:21:11,271 --> 00:21:12,774
Then go on tour.

354
00:21:12,981 --> 00:21:14,024
But I need help.

355
00:21:14,566 --> 00:21:18,570
You'll have to find a nanny
so that Clarissa can have a break.

356
00:21:19,613 --> 00:21:21,783
A cousin of hers would do it.

357
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:24,201
I like her and she's got experience.

358
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,203
I don't want a stranger.

359
00:21:26,578 --> 00:21:28,455
-Talk to her about it.
-Of course.

360
00:21:28,538 --> 00:21:31,333
And ask dad for money for my upkeep.

361
00:21:32,084 --> 00:21:33,711
Remind him I'm still a minor.

362
00:21:33,795 --> 00:21:36,421
Don't worry about money,
that isn't a problem.

363
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:42,887
Ana should go back to Granada,
to her friends. She knows nobody here.

364
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:44,680
<i>I don't think she wants to come back.</i>

365
00:21:44,764 --> 00:21:49,393
Call her and ask her lovingly.
Promise her it's the best place for her.

366
00:21:49,476 --> 00:21:52,646
Show a little interest in her,
after all she's been through.

367
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:55,399
<i>If she comes back,
it'll just stir things up again.</i>

368
00:21:55,482 --> 00:21:57,777
I can't miss this chance.

369
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:59,821
It's horrible that
we're arguing about this!

370
00:21:59,904 --> 00:22:01,238
<i>Ask her if she wants to come.</i>

371
00:22:01,739 --> 00:22:06,451
I'd like to hear that you have
a minimal interest in her going back.

372
00:22:06,535 --> 00:22:10,205
Remember that by law
she's your responsibility.

373
00:22:10,289 --> 00:22:14,334
You took her from me
and look at how you sent her back.

374
00:22:14,418 --> 00:22:16,336
<i>That's not what we're talking about.</i>

375
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:18,422
Well, now you know the situation.

376
00:22:18,505 --> 00:22:20,507
Call me and tell me what you decide.

377
00:22:42,864 --> 00:22:44,156
Hello.

378
00:22:44,239 --> 00:22:46,283
<i>Hello, Janis. How are you?</i>

379
00:22:47,409 --> 00:22:49,661
Very busy, you can imagine.

380
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:54,541
<i>I'm in Madrid.
May I drop by and meet Cecilia?</i>

381
00:22:58,337 --> 00:23:01,173
I'm not presentable,
and I'm really busy...

382
00:23:02,341 --> 00:23:04,426
But give me an hour, OK?

383
00:23:05,177 --> 00:23:06,970
<i>OK, thank you.</i>

384
00:23:07,179 --> 00:23:09,139
See you then.

385
00:23:13,895 --> 00:23:15,772
Can I tell you something?

386
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:20,317
When I finish the course
on Hispanic Philology

387
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,905
I'd like to enroll
for Classical Literature.

388
00:23:24,488 --> 00:23:27,532
Can I carry on staying here?

389
00:23:27,616 --> 00:23:29,159
I don't know.

390
00:23:29,242 --> 00:23:31,913
If you stay,
you'll have to pay more attention.

391
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,122
You're very scatterbrained.

392
00:23:34,206 --> 00:23:36,375
And don't put on the headphones at night!

393
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:37,376
No...

394
00:23:37,459 --> 00:23:38,920
You do as you please!

395
00:23:41,171 --> 00:23:42,339
I'll get it.

396
00:23:42,422 --> 00:23:44,299
Leave us on our own. Don't appear.

397
00:23:55,143 --> 00:23:57,229
Hello.

398
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:00,733
Happy anniversary.

399
00:24:00,817 --> 00:24:02,150
Anniversary of what?

400
00:24:03,026 --> 00:24:05,570
It's a year today
since we first slept together.

401
00:24:05,654 --> 00:24:07,364
Is it?

402
00:24:26,801 --> 00:24:27,926
Is anything wrong?

403
00:24:29,469 --> 00:24:30,470
I'm pregnant.

404
00:24:32,139 --> 00:24:34,224
And what are you going to do?

405
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:36,685
Have it.

406
00:24:39,938 --> 00:24:42,482
I've gone over it a thousand times...

407
00:24:42,566 --> 00:24:44,693
I didn't think it could happen,

408
00:24:45,527 --> 00:24:48,614
but I've always wanted children
and I'm almost 40.

409
00:24:48,697 --> 00:24:49,948
Time is passing.

410
00:24:50,032 --> 00:24:51,408
Yeah.

411
00:24:51,491 --> 00:24:53,577
Sorry, I'm kind of in shock.

412
00:24:54,202 --> 00:24:55,287
Yeah.

413
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:57,247
I love the idea
of having a child with you,

414
00:24:57,331 --> 00:24:58,248
believe me,

415
00:24:58,332 --> 00:25:00,626
but I don't know
if I can allow myself that now.

416
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:02,961
It isn't a matter of
allowing ourselves that,

417
00:25:03,045 --> 00:25:04,129
it's already here.

418
00:25:04,212 --> 00:25:07,966
-Not yet. There are alternatives.
-I'm going to have it.

419
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:11,094
My wife has cancer,
she's right in the middle of chemotherapy.

420
00:25:11,303 --> 00:25:12,596
I know, and I'm sorry.

421
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:15,641
It isn't the time to tell her
I'm having a child with someone else.

422
00:25:15,725 --> 00:25:18,728
I've told you
because I thought you should know,

423
00:25:18,811 --> 00:25:21,021
but I'm freeing you
of any responsibility.

424
00:25:21,229 --> 00:25:23,231
I'm following my family's tradition.

425
00:25:23,482 --> 00:25:27,069
I'll be a single mother, like my mother,
and my grandmother.

426
00:25:27,277 --> 00:25:29,488
Janis, please.

427
00:25:30,823 --> 00:25:34,117
At least consider the possibility
of not having it now.

428
00:25:34,493 --> 00:25:36,662
We can plan it for the future.

429
00:25:36,746 --> 00:25:38,497
But this is the future.

430
00:25:39,623 --> 00:25:42,626
Our relationship
was very clear from the start,

431
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:45,295
no commitments,
on your part or mine.

432
00:25:45,379 --> 00:25:49,299
I don't regret anything,
I've been very happy with you.

433
00:25:49,383 --> 00:25:51,426
So have I,
that's why I want to protect this.

434
00:25:54,722 --> 00:25:58,267
I don't think our relationship
is strong enough to survive this.

435
00:25:58,350 --> 00:25:59,351
What do you suggest?

436
00:26:04,398 --> 00:26:06,650
That we separate,

437
00:26:06,734 --> 00:26:08,068
with no hard feelings.

438
00:26:08,694 --> 00:26:10,487
The baby is my concern,

439
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:13,490
but to cope with this
we'll stop seeing each other.

440
00:26:13,573 --> 00:26:14,574
Don't say that.

441
00:26:16,118 --> 00:26:18,662
If we keep in touch,
we'll keep screwing

442
00:26:18,746 --> 00:26:22,082
and in a few months we'll end up
having the same conversation.

443
00:26:22,457 --> 00:26:24,042
It's better to end it now.

444
00:26:29,882 --> 00:26:31,759
Hello.

445
00:26:32,802 --> 00:26:34,386
It's been a long time!

446
00:26:34,636 --> 00:26:37,014
I've lost all notion of time.

447
00:26:38,098 --> 00:26:41,560
-Here, for both of you.
-Thank you.

448
00:26:41,643 --> 00:26:42,770
It's cute.

449
00:26:42,854 --> 00:26:45,732
I was waiting for you to call,
but as you didn't, here I am.

450
00:26:46,774 --> 00:26:47,775
Can I see her?

451
00:26:48,358 --> 00:26:50,944
-Yes, she's asleep.
-I won't wake her.

452
00:26:51,028 --> 00:26:51,945
-Come on.
-Thank you.

453
00:26:57,869 --> 00:26:59,494
Look.

454
00:27:01,789 --> 00:27:03,665
-Can I touch her?
-Of course.

455
00:27:13,508 --> 00:27:15,177
She's going to be very dark like you.

456
00:27:15,385 --> 00:27:16,763
Yes, she's very dark.

457
00:27:18,806 --> 00:27:20,850
Who do you think she looks like?

458
00:27:20,933 --> 00:27:23,393
I think she's got my father's features.

459
00:27:25,479 --> 00:27:27,189
I thought you never knew him.

460
00:27:27,397 --> 00:27:30,484
I didn't,
I'd have been a few months old.

461
00:27:30,567 --> 00:27:34,696
My grandmother said he was Venezuelan,
with almond-shaped eyes.

462
00:27:35,322 --> 00:27:36,990
The same eyes.

463
00:27:37,074 --> 00:27:38,701
Yes...

464
00:27:38,785 --> 00:27:41,328
She's going to be very pretty.

465
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,539
Well...

466
00:27:45,165 --> 00:27:47,752
And how are you?

467
00:27:47,835 --> 00:27:51,923
Fine.
With a lot of work, like always.

468
00:27:55,425 --> 00:27:58,011
Are you all organized?
Do you need anything?

469
00:27:58,095 --> 00:28:01,808
I've got an au-pair
who helps me with the baby

470
00:28:01,891 --> 00:28:04,685
and I saved enough
to take a few months off.

471
00:28:04,769 --> 00:28:07,730
-I can't be away from her now.
-Of course.

472
00:28:08,063 --> 00:28:09,523
Would you like a drink?

473
00:28:09,606 --> 00:28:11,984
No, I've got a very early start.

474
00:28:12,693 --> 00:28:15,946
I just wanted to see you both
for a minute. I'm off now.

475
00:28:20,785 --> 00:28:22,119
Well...

476
00:28:22,202 --> 00:28:23,746
She's beautiful.

477
00:28:24,288 --> 00:28:26,081
You've done a good job.

478
00:28:26,164 --> 00:28:27,624
Thank you.

479
00:28:34,339 --> 00:28:35,758
I'm working in the morning.

480
00:28:35,842 --> 00:28:38,093
In the afternoon I'll be in the hotel,
the usual one.

481
00:28:38,594 --> 00:28:40,429
Call me if you want.

482
00:28:40,512 --> 00:28:42,306
OK, so long.

483
00:28:42,514 --> 00:28:43,515
Goodbye.

484
00:29:02,827 --> 00:29:04,494
Hello.

485
00:29:04,704 --> 00:29:05,996
Come in.

486
00:29:11,251 --> 00:29:13,045
Give me a second,
I'm sending an e-mail.

487
00:29:13,128 --> 00:29:14,296
OK.

488
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:19,927
Sit down.

489
00:29:23,723 --> 00:29:25,515
That's it.

490
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:27,351
-Would you like anything?
-No.

491
00:29:30,187 --> 00:29:32,481
I'm listening.

492
00:29:34,441 --> 00:29:36,736
Since the baby was born,

493
00:29:36,819 --> 00:29:39,363
I'd been looking forward to your visit,

494
00:29:39,571 --> 00:29:41,239
even though we'd decided to separate.

495
00:29:41,323 --> 00:29:42,616
You decided that.

496
00:29:42,825 --> 00:29:45,118
Yes, I decided that.

497
00:29:45,494 --> 00:29:48,080
But I imagined you'd be curious
to see your daughter.

498
00:29:48,163 --> 00:29:49,539
I was.

499
00:29:50,457 --> 00:29:53,251
I've been struggling all these months
not to call you

500
00:29:53,335 --> 00:29:55,295
until I couldn't take it anymore.

501
00:29:55,504 --> 00:29:59,174
I was so excited
about seeing her and seeing you.

502
00:29:59,257 --> 00:30:02,511
So what happened last night?
And don't tell me that nothing happened.

503
00:30:03,846 --> 00:30:05,973
I think the baby isn't mine.

504
00:30:07,391 --> 00:30:08,433
What?

505
00:30:09,727 --> 00:30:11,061
I didn't recognize her.

506
00:30:12,646 --> 00:30:14,816
-What does that mean?
-It's what I felt.

507
00:30:16,441 --> 00:30:18,652
What you're saying
isn't very scientific.

508
00:30:18,736 --> 00:30:20,404
I don't think she's my daughter.

509
00:30:20,946 --> 00:30:22,865
You mean it's another man's?

510
00:30:22,948 --> 00:30:24,116
I don't know. You tell me.

511
00:30:24,324 --> 00:30:28,537
During the time we were together
you were the only man I slept with.

512
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:31,081
Do you really think
the baby takes after your father?

513
00:30:31,164 --> 00:30:32,249
You know I never met him.

514
00:30:32,332 --> 00:30:34,877
I only know what my grandmother said
and she never met him.

515
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,754
Do you have any photos of him?

516
00:30:36,838 --> 00:30:38,588
No, I don't.

517
00:30:40,382 --> 00:30:43,176
If I'd wanted to fool you
about your paternity,

518
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:45,387
why would I have asked
that we separate?

519
00:30:45,596 --> 00:30:48,140
If I'd intended to lie
I'd have stayed with you.

520
00:30:49,141 --> 00:30:51,393
When we split up
I didn't ask you for anything!

521
00:30:51,476 --> 00:30:52,603
Why would I fool you now?

522
00:30:52,686 --> 00:30:54,104
I don't understand it either.

523
00:30:57,065 --> 00:30:58,984
To end my doubts,

524
00:30:59,985 --> 00:31:01,904
let me do a paternity test.

525
00:31:01,987 --> 00:31:02,905
No.

526
00:31:02,988 --> 00:31:03,947
Janis, please.

527
00:31:06,868 --> 00:31:09,036
It's best if I leave.

528
00:31:11,955 --> 00:31:13,123
Don't call me again.

529
00:31:13,206 --> 00:31:15,918
If there's any news about the grave,
someone else can call me.

530
00:31:16,001 --> 00:31:18,545
I'm sorry we still have
that matter in common.

531
00:31:18,629 --> 00:31:21,214
We're adults.
We don't have to mix things.

532
00:31:21,298 --> 00:31:22,925
And stop thinking about your pride.

533
00:31:23,008 --> 00:31:25,427
If there are doubts,
the only answer is to do the test.

534
00:31:25,636 --> 00:31:27,304
-I have no doubts.
-But I do.

535
00:31:27,387 --> 00:31:29,473
Very well.

536
00:31:29,681 --> 00:31:30,892
Janis!

537
00:31:40,108 --> 00:31:41,443
What'll I do with this foot?

538
00:31:41,652 --> 00:31:44,906
I'm going to eat this foot.

539
00:31:48,367 --> 00:31:49,451
<i>Yes?</i>

540
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:51,453
Janis, it's Ana.

541
00:31:51,662 --> 00:31:52,747
Ana who?

542
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:54,373
<i>We had our babies together.</i>

543
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:57,794
Oh, Ana!

544
00:31:57,877 --> 00:31:59,294
Forgive me, love.

545
00:31:59,378 --> 00:32:01,881
I had a fight with my baby's father
and I'm furious.

546
00:32:01,964 --> 00:32:04,007
I thought he was out of the picture.

547
00:32:04,091 --> 00:32:05,550
<i>He really is!</i>

548
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,386
This won't happen again.

549
00:32:08,345 --> 00:32:10,222
How are you, and Anita?

550
00:32:10,305 --> 00:32:13,183
She's right here, I'm changing her.

551
00:32:13,267 --> 00:32:16,019
She's wonderful, really.

552
00:32:16,103 --> 00:32:18,397
What? What are you saying?

553
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,564
<i>I hear her.</i>

554
00:32:20,065 --> 00:32:22,442
I'm a bit tired, to be honest.

555
00:32:22,526 --> 00:32:24,821
I need more sleep, but I'm fine.

556
00:32:24,904 --> 00:32:26,697
Doesn't your mother help you?

557
00:32:26,781 --> 00:32:28,115
Oh, my mother...

558
00:32:28,198 --> 00:32:30,242
My mother comes and goes.

559
00:32:30,325 --> 00:32:32,327
She's in the provinces now

560
00:32:32,411 --> 00:32:35,915
on a tour with
<i>Doña Rosita the Spinster.</i>

561
00:32:36,456 --> 00:32:37,624
What are you saying?

562
00:32:37,709 --> 00:32:40,210
Haven't you got a nanny?

563
00:32:40,294 --> 00:32:43,171
Yes, and the maid helps me out too.

564
00:32:45,883 --> 00:32:47,968
You were right.

565
00:32:48,552 --> 00:32:52,556
Anita is a gift,
she's all that matters to me.

566
00:32:52,639 --> 00:32:53,808
<i>Of course.</i>

567
00:32:54,349 --> 00:32:56,101
And how is yours?

568
00:32:56,184 --> 00:32:58,186
I think she's beautiful.

569
00:32:58,270 --> 00:33:01,148
I'll come and see you
and they can meet each other.

570
00:33:01,231 --> 00:33:03,108
I'd love that.

571
00:33:04,151 --> 00:33:05,862
Listen, I have to go now.

572
00:33:05,944 --> 00:33:08,781
Call me whenever you want.

573
00:33:08,865 --> 00:33:12,200
I'm delighted to hear from you,
even if you're angry with that man.

574
00:33:12,284 --> 00:33:15,120
Kisses, 'bye.

575
00:33:19,751 --> 00:33:21,836
Now, my love, go to sleep.

576
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:23,962
I'm going to the hospital.

577
00:33:24,046 --> 00:33:25,464
The washing machine's on.

578
00:33:25,547 --> 00:33:28,258
When the duchess gets here,
tell her to hang out the clothes.

579
00:33:28,342 --> 00:33:30,010
-I can iron them tomorrow.
-Yes.

580
00:33:30,427 --> 00:33:31,470
How is he?

581
00:33:31,553 --> 00:33:32,971
It doesn't look good.

582
00:33:35,223 --> 00:33:36,975
Yes, my love, yes...

583
00:33:38,895 --> 00:33:40,145
You have to sleep.

584
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:54,702
DNA TESTING KIT

585
00:33:54,786 --> 00:33:55,661
MATERNITY TEST

586
00:33:57,789 --> 00:33:59,832
PERSONS TO GIVE BIOLOGICAL SAMPLES

587
00:34:03,168 --> 00:34:04,879
MOTHER

588
00:34:05,797 --> 00:34:06,798
DAUGHTER

589
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:38,954
-How's the website going?
-Very well.

590
00:34:39,037 --> 00:34:41,873
-And how's the audience today?
-3,000 and rising.

591
00:34:41,957 --> 00:34:43,124
Great.

592
00:34:43,667 --> 00:34:45,043
Excuse me a moment.

593
00:34:46,169 --> 00:34:47,004
Yes, Janis.

594
00:34:47,086 --> 00:34:49,256
Do you have a minute?

595
00:34:49,339 --> 00:34:50,423
<i>No, but go ahead.</i>

596
00:34:51,633 --> 00:34:53,677
I'm going back to work.

597
00:34:54,218 --> 00:34:58,682
<i>I don't like the au pair girl.
I want to hire a proper babysitter.</i>

598
00:34:59,349 --> 00:35:02,185
If you need money, I can help you out.

599
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:05,063
Thanks, Elena, but I need to work.

600
00:35:05,397 --> 00:35:08,233
Is there anything immediate
in your supplement?

601
00:35:08,317 --> 00:35:10,152
Nothing immediate.

602
00:35:10,694 --> 00:35:13,238
The big stuff is already allocated.
What's left?

603
00:35:13,947 --> 00:35:15,991
Still lifes of accessories.

604
00:35:16,074 --> 00:35:19,953
<i>Shoes, jewelry, a few belts...
Nothing else.</i>

605
00:35:20,037 --> 00:35:23,165
I'd be delighted to photograph
shoes and belts.

606
00:35:23,248 --> 00:35:25,793
You're too good
a photographer for that.

607
00:35:26,376 --> 00:35:27,669
I need to work.

608
00:35:28,211 --> 00:35:32,382
If it's not outside of Madrid,
I'll do still lifes of anything.

609
00:35:32,466 --> 00:35:33,675
<i>I don't mind.</i>

610
00:35:33,885 --> 00:35:37,179
I'll come and see you about it,
and see the baby as well.

611
00:35:37,262 --> 00:35:39,097
I was thinking

612
00:35:39,181 --> 00:35:41,893
that you two could move in
with me for a while.

613
00:35:41,975 --> 00:35:44,227
I've got lots of space,
there's the garden...

614
00:35:44,978 --> 00:35:46,521
<i>We can keep each other company.</i>

615
00:35:46,605 --> 00:35:49,524
Thank you,
but it would be a real upheaval,

616
00:35:49,608 --> 00:35:50,818
and it's far away.

617
00:35:51,026 --> 00:35:53,236
I'm very well organized here.

618
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,237
OK.

619
00:35:54,321 --> 00:35:55,614
I'll see you later.

620
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,325
Do you need anything?

621
00:35:58,408 --> 00:35:59,744
No, thank you.

622
00:36:03,748 --> 00:36:05,750
I can't stand her, I swear.

623
00:36:07,209 --> 00:36:08,711
She's enjoying it.

624
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:10,755
Let's get out,

625
00:36:10,963 --> 00:36:13,548
so you don't catch cold.

626
00:36:22,432 --> 00:36:26,311
What a lovely little baby.

627
00:36:28,272 --> 00:36:30,190
She's getting more ethnic, eh?

628
00:36:30,649 --> 00:36:32,234
She's like your father.

629
00:36:32,317 --> 00:36:33,652
Exactly like him!

630
00:36:34,695 --> 00:36:35,988
I don't know what he was like.

631
00:36:36,071 --> 00:36:37,489
Wasn't he Colombian?

632
00:36:37,572 --> 00:36:42,286
Venezuelan. A dealer, my grandmother said,
but who knows?

633
00:36:42,369 --> 00:36:44,413
I thought you were sure.

634
00:36:44,496 --> 00:36:45,707
No.

635
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:49,794
Who else could she look like,
apart from the anthropologist?

636
00:36:49,877 --> 00:36:52,004
Because she doesn't look like him.

637
00:36:52,087 --> 00:36:52,963
No!

638
00:36:53,505 --> 00:36:55,299
I only slept with Arturo.

639
00:36:55,382 --> 00:36:57,634
Then she looks like your father,
that's it.

640
00:36:58,552 --> 00:37:00,929
Right, Cecilia?
You're like your Venezuelan grandfather.

641
00:37:06,935 --> 00:37:07,812
I'm off.

642
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:10,689
I'll see you tomorrow in the office
about the photos.

643
00:37:10,773 --> 00:37:12,232
Something will come up.

644
00:37:13,066 --> 00:37:15,485
And think about coming to my house.

645
00:37:15,569 --> 00:37:16,528
No.

646
00:37:16,612 --> 00:37:18,238
You're so stubborn.

647
00:37:19,741 --> 00:37:21,283
See you tomorrow.

648
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:34,296
What an angel face.

649
00:37:35,964 --> 00:37:37,382
Let's see you pose for mom.

650
00:37:40,344 --> 00:37:41,678
Let's see...

651
00:37:41,763 --> 00:37:43,055
She's getting angry.

652
00:37:44,306 --> 00:37:45,641
What a bad temper.

653
00:37:46,308 --> 00:37:47,769
This came for you.

654
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:50,062
Thanks.

655
00:37:50,145 --> 00:37:52,397
Look at her, pretty as a piglet.

656
00:37:52,481 --> 00:37:53,440
Thanks!

657
00:37:53,523 --> 00:37:56,068
They said that to me
and see how pretty I turned out.

658
00:37:58,821 --> 00:38:00,197
Labgenetics.

659
00:38:09,749 --> 00:38:12,459
Gloves must be worn.
No smoking.

660
00:38:12,542 --> 00:38:15,379
There can be no organic remains
in the mouth.

661
00:38:20,175 --> 00:38:22,427
We have to leave it for tomorrow.

662
00:38:29,559 --> 00:38:30,770
Darling...

663
00:38:35,148 --> 00:38:36,400
What?

664
00:39:13,437 --> 00:39:15,230
Let's see, little one.

665
00:39:16,774 --> 00:39:18,567
This side.

666
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:20,235
This side, my love.

667
00:39:20,319 --> 00:39:22,237
There, my love, that's it.

668
00:39:22,321 --> 00:39:25,198
So that we can both stop worrying.

669
00:40:10,118 --> 00:40:13,455
REPORT ON BIOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION
OF MATERNITY

670
00:40:20,587 --> 00:40:22,757
JANIS MARTÍNEZ IS NOT

671
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:25,509
THE BIOLOGICAL MOTHER OF CECILIA MARTÍNEZ

672
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:34,226
NOT THE BIOLOGICAL MOTHER

673
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:40,733
100% PROBABILITY

674
00:41:20,564 --> 00:41:22,524
<i>Méndez Law Firm.</i>

675
00:41:22,608 --> 00:41:26,570
May I speak to the lawyer
Mauricio Méndez?

676
00:41:26,653 --> 00:41:28,947
<i>He's in court now.
May I take a message?</i>

677
00:41:30,115 --> 00:41:32,284
No, I'll call later.

678
00:42:02,815 --> 00:42:03,775
<i>Yes?</i>

679
00:42:03,858 --> 00:42:06,693
May I speak to Ana?
This is Janis.

680
00:42:06,778 --> 00:42:10,782
<i>She can't take your call,
she's bathing the baby.</i>

681
00:42:10,865 --> 00:42:12,199
<i>She'll call you later.</i>

682
00:42:12,825 --> 00:42:17,037
It's all right.
I just wanted to ask how the baby was.

683
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:19,749
<i>She fusses a bit at night</i>

684
00:42:19,832 --> 00:42:23,585
<i>but she's beautiful
and Ana is a great mother.</i>

685
00:42:24,586 --> 00:42:26,046
Of course.

686
00:42:26,129 --> 00:42:29,132
Thank you, goodbye.

687
00:42:34,012 --> 00:42:35,973
NOT THE BIOLOGICAL MOTHER

688
00:43:08,964 --> 00:43:10,424
Hello?

689
00:43:10,507 --> 00:43:12,551
<i>Hello, Janis. Did you call me?</i>

690
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:14,970
No.

691
00:43:15,053 --> 00:43:17,724
Maybe by accident,
I've just put it in my purse.

692
00:43:19,099 --> 00:43:22,019
<i>That happens at times...
Are you all right?</i>

693
00:43:23,395 --> 00:43:24,980
I've got a lot going on.

694
00:43:25,063 --> 00:43:28,317
I'm going to get rid of the au pair and...

695
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:31,904
Domestic problems, nothing important.

696
00:43:31,987 --> 00:43:33,113
<i>You sound upset.</i>

697
00:43:33,781 --> 00:43:37,951
You've got me at a bad time.
I can't talk now, I'm sorry.

698
00:43:38,452 --> 00:43:40,537
Goodbye, Arturo,
and thanks for calling.

699
00:43:40,872 --> 00:43:42,122
<i>'Bye.</i>

700
00:43:49,881 --> 00:43:52,132
I'm sleeping with the baby tonight.

701
00:43:54,259 --> 00:43:55,344
Shall I help you?

702
00:43:55,552 --> 00:43:58,138
No, I'll move her.

703
00:44:06,773 --> 00:44:09,734
Come to mommy.

704
00:44:46,561 --> 00:44:48,063
I love the color.

705
00:44:49,398 --> 00:44:50,524
Our pleasure.

706
00:44:50,607 --> 00:44:51,859
Hello.

707
00:44:51,942 --> 00:44:53,360
I'd like to change my number.

708
00:44:53,568 --> 00:44:54,862
What phone do you have?

709
00:44:54,945 --> 00:44:55,863
This one.

710
00:44:56,781 --> 00:44:58,991
But I'd like to keep
all that's on this one.

711
00:44:59,074 --> 00:44:59,909
No problem.

712
00:44:59,992 --> 00:45:01,243
-You're sure?
-Yes.

713
00:45:15,132 --> 00:45:16,926
The earphones again!

714
00:45:20,304 --> 00:45:22,973
I've told you 1,000 times
to put her on her side!

715
00:45:23,056 --> 00:45:24,641
If she vomits, she could choke!

716
00:45:25,934 --> 00:45:28,186
Come here, my love.

717
00:45:30,105 --> 00:45:32,024
Don't you understand what I say?

718
00:45:34,610 --> 00:45:36,821
You've been here for ages
and you've learned nothing.

719
00:45:36,904 --> 00:45:38,572
I don't want you to stay on.

720
00:45:38,655 --> 00:45:40,157
But I've enrolled.

721
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:42,242
I don't care. Find another house.

722
00:45:42,326 --> 00:45:44,536
I'm not leaving her with you
for another night!

723
00:45:44,953 --> 00:45:46,455
I've had enough.

724
00:46:07,392 --> 00:46:08,685
Hello.

725
00:46:08,770 --> 00:46:09,812
Come in.

726
00:46:09,896 --> 00:46:11,773
Here I am with Cecilia.

727
00:46:11,856 --> 00:46:13,273
Hello, Cecilia.

728
00:46:13,357 --> 00:46:15,233
Leave the baby carrier here.

729
00:46:18,695 --> 00:46:21,281
Well, darling...

730
00:46:21,365 --> 00:46:24,869
She's a bit cranky,
I've just woken her.

731
00:46:24,952 --> 00:46:26,746
Don't worry.

732
00:46:26,829 --> 00:46:30,332
Aren't you a beautiful baby?

733
00:46:30,415 --> 00:46:33,753
I'm very nervous,
it's the first time we've been separated.

734
00:46:33,836 --> 00:46:37,631
Don't worry,
I'll be watching her the whole time.

735
00:46:37,715 --> 00:46:39,091
This'll be like her second home.

736
00:46:40,342 --> 00:46:43,512
Here... That's it.

737
00:46:51,687 --> 00:46:53,480
Do you leave her on the floor?

738
00:46:53,689 --> 00:46:54,774
Yes.

739
00:46:54,857 --> 00:46:57,819
You mustn't force any position,
she'll decide what's best.

740
00:46:59,361 --> 00:47:01,238
I've brought what you asked for.

741
00:47:01,321 --> 00:47:05,993
The wipes, a change, the bottles...

742
00:47:07,369 --> 00:47:11,248
The cream and... that's it.

743
00:47:11,331 --> 00:47:12,332
Perfect.

744
00:47:13,417 --> 00:47:15,335
And you've got my number.

745
00:47:15,419 --> 00:47:16,420
Great.

746
00:47:17,671 --> 00:47:18,840
Darling.

747
00:47:19,423 --> 00:47:20,925
Yes, my love.

748
00:47:21,008 --> 00:47:24,846
I'll come and get my little mouse later.

749
00:47:25,554 --> 00:47:27,097
I love you.

750
00:47:28,015 --> 00:47:29,224
Thank you.

751
00:47:29,308 --> 00:47:31,226
I'll see you later.

752
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:42,195
Excuse me.

753
00:47:48,745 --> 00:47:51,163
I've got a little girl.

754
00:48:30,745 --> 00:48:32,079
What can I get you?

755
00:48:32,579 --> 00:48:33,413
Hello.

756
00:48:33,497 --> 00:48:35,958
Coffee with milk and a blueberry muffin.

757
00:48:38,878 --> 00:48:40,295
Ana?

758
00:48:40,379 --> 00:48:42,422
-Are you Ana?
-Yes, Janis, it's me.

759
00:48:42,506 --> 00:48:43,632
What are you doing here?

760
00:48:43,716 --> 00:48:45,175
I work here.

761
00:48:45,259 --> 00:48:48,178
You've changed so much!
I didn't recognize you.

762
00:48:48,262 --> 00:48:50,138
-You look wonderful.
-Thank you.

763
00:48:50,222 --> 00:48:51,766
I'll bring you the coffee.

764
00:49:09,116 --> 00:49:10,993
May I sit with you for a minute?

765
00:49:11,076 --> 00:49:12,452
Of course.

766
00:49:14,747 --> 00:49:17,291
How long have you been here?
I haven't seen you.

767
00:49:17,374 --> 00:49:18,876
Almost a week.

768
00:49:19,418 --> 00:49:22,421
So we're neighbors.
What a coincidence.

769
00:49:22,504 --> 00:49:26,341
To be honest,
I came to your house,

770
00:49:26,967 --> 00:49:29,386
but then I felt silly
and didn't buzz you.

771
00:49:29,469 --> 00:49:31,054
I came in here to have something

772
00:49:31,555 --> 00:49:34,016
and the head waiter offered me a job.

773
00:49:34,099 --> 00:49:35,559
Well, I asked too.

774
00:49:35,852 --> 00:49:38,270
And now I've got a room in his house.

775
00:49:38,937 --> 00:49:40,230
And your mother?

776
00:49:40,314 --> 00:49:42,608
She's in Barcelona now, doing theater.

777
00:49:42,817 --> 00:49:44,401
She never stops.

778
00:49:44,484 --> 00:49:46,028
She's finally a success.

779
00:49:47,321 --> 00:49:48,865
She left you on your own?

780
00:49:48,947 --> 00:49:50,867
Yes, I call her occasionally

781
00:49:50,949 --> 00:49:53,160
but I still haven't told her
I've moved out

782
00:49:53,243 --> 00:49:55,287
and I've forbidden Clarissa
to tell her.

783
00:49:55,370 --> 00:49:58,040
When she comes back
she'll get a big surprise.

784
00:49:58,123 --> 00:49:59,082
So you ran away.

785
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,587
I'm an adult and I'm just a burden to her.

786
00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:04,714
And your father?

787
00:50:04,797 --> 00:50:06,632
He still has no idea.

788
00:50:06,841 --> 00:50:09,009
What a family scene!

789
00:50:09,092 --> 00:50:10,302
I'm used to it.

790
00:50:10,385 --> 00:50:14,514
I'm broke, but for the first time
I'm in control of my life.

791
00:50:14,598 --> 00:50:16,016
I'll do OK.

792
00:50:16,726 --> 00:50:18,143
I'm sure.

793
00:50:18,226 --> 00:50:20,855
I can't stay,
I've got a taxi waiting.

794
00:50:21,521 --> 00:50:22,356
Wait.

795
00:50:22,606 --> 00:50:23,941
Don't worry, my treat.

796
00:50:24,399 --> 00:50:25,275
Yes?

797
00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:26,443
Thank you.

798
00:50:30,238 --> 00:50:32,074
What time do you finish?

799
00:50:32,157 --> 00:50:33,868
Today, at 9:00.

800
00:50:34,827 --> 00:50:38,622
Shall we meet at my place?
You've got the address.

801
00:50:38,831 --> 00:50:39,916
Sure.

802
00:50:40,750 --> 00:50:42,084
I'm delighted to see you.

803
00:50:42,167 --> 00:50:43,335
Same here.

804
00:50:43,418 --> 00:50:44,336
Goodbye.

805
00:50:44,419 --> 00:50:46,171
Thank you for the coffee and...

806
00:50:58,225 --> 00:50:59,226
Good morning.

807
00:51:00,269 --> 00:51:01,270
Where are we going?

808
00:51:01,729 --> 00:51:04,273
17, Quintiliano Street.

809
00:51:04,523 --> 00:51:05,941
We're on our way.

810
00:51:21,456 --> 00:51:23,208
Hello.

811
00:51:23,583 --> 00:51:25,669
Thank you for inviting me.

812
00:51:28,088 --> 00:51:29,548
What a lovely home!

813
00:51:29,631 --> 00:51:31,049
Thank you.

814
00:51:31,133 --> 00:51:35,304
This morning, with the rush,
I didn't ask about your daughter.

815
00:51:35,722 --> 00:51:39,224
How do you manage with her
now that you're working?

816
00:51:39,809 --> 00:51:43,520
Do you leave her in a nursery?
You have long hours.

817
00:51:45,063 --> 00:51:46,231
What is it?

818
00:51:46,481 --> 00:51:47,941
Are you all right?

819
00:51:48,025 --> 00:51:49,443
Anita died.

820
00:51:53,655 --> 00:51:55,324
Don't tell me that.

821
00:52:08,211 --> 00:52:10,339
But she looks so well.

822
00:52:10,422 --> 00:52:11,758
What happened?

823
00:52:14,384 --> 00:52:16,386
A crib death.

824
00:52:17,012 --> 00:52:18,597
But from what?

825
00:52:18,931 --> 00:52:21,224
A crib death,
that's what it's called.

826
00:52:23,018 --> 00:52:25,312
She died in her sleep.

827
00:52:27,064 --> 00:52:29,817
What symptoms did she have?

828
00:52:30,359 --> 00:52:31,778
None.

829
00:52:34,154 --> 00:52:36,198
She was perfect.

830
00:52:38,075 --> 00:52:40,870
Her brain forgot to breathe.

831
00:52:44,289 --> 00:52:47,042
Cerebral immaturity, the doctor said.

832
00:52:50,045 --> 00:52:51,505
Immaturity?

833
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:57,344
During the first year, apparently,
a baby's brain isn't developed

834
00:52:58,721 --> 00:53:01,223
and it can forget
to give the order to breathe.

835
00:53:03,267 --> 00:53:06,144
Can't anything be done to prevent it?

836
00:53:06,228 --> 00:53:08,438
No, it's a very rare case.

837
00:53:09,356 --> 00:53:12,109
It happens once in a million times.

838
00:53:13,610 --> 00:53:15,946
But Anita was perfect, you saw that.

839
00:53:16,029 --> 00:53:17,782
Excuse me.

840
00:53:32,129 --> 00:53:33,923
She's beautiful.

841
00:53:37,175 --> 00:53:38,927
Do you want to see her?

842
00:53:39,595 --> 00:53:40,722
Please.

843
00:53:42,222 --> 00:53:44,308
How was your siesta, my love?

844
00:53:44,391 --> 00:53:47,227
A friend has come.

845
00:53:47,311 --> 00:53:49,479
-May I pick her up?
-Of course.

846
00:53:49,563 --> 00:53:51,523
Will you come with me?

847
00:53:51,607 --> 00:53:54,861
You are so beautiful.

848
00:53:55,068 --> 00:53:56,904
She's so big.

849
00:53:58,865 --> 00:54:01,241
Aren't you pretty!

850
00:54:01,950 --> 00:54:04,286
Hang on.

851
00:54:06,288 --> 00:54:07,372
Yes?

852
00:54:07,456 --> 00:54:10,542
<i>I'm the café manager.
I was to meet Ana.</i>

853
00:54:10,626 --> 00:54:12,544
I'll tell her now.

854
00:54:13,045 --> 00:54:14,296
Ana!

855
00:54:15,130 --> 00:54:18,258
It's the café manager,
he's waiting downstairs.

856
00:54:18,342 --> 00:54:19,844
That's right, I have to go.

857
00:54:20,052 --> 00:54:22,095
She'll be down now.

858
00:54:26,475 --> 00:54:29,686
-She's a wonderful child.
-Thank you.

859
00:54:30,855 --> 00:54:33,858
Could you send me
that photo of Anita?

860
00:54:33,941 --> 00:54:35,108
Of course,

861
00:54:35,192 --> 00:54:37,194
but you've changed your number.

862
00:54:37,277 --> 00:54:38,863
I've called you lots of times and...

863
00:54:39,071 --> 00:54:41,490
I'll write it down for you now.

864
00:54:41,783 --> 00:54:43,325
I'll get my backpack.

865
00:54:54,962 --> 00:54:56,213
Here it is.

866
00:54:56,296 --> 00:54:57,631
I'll send it to you now.

867
00:55:01,969 --> 00:55:03,763
I'm so sorry, Ana.

868
00:55:04,429 --> 00:55:05,555
Really.

869
00:55:06,473 --> 00:55:07,725
Thank you.

870
00:55:14,564 --> 00:55:16,400
Well...

871
00:55:16,483 --> 00:55:17,567
Goodbye, love.

872
00:55:17,651 --> 00:55:19,027
Goodbye.

873
00:55:22,281 --> 00:55:23,615
Goodbye, Ana.

874
00:55:27,369 --> 00:55:29,579
Come here, my love.

875
00:55:58,150 --> 00:56:01,486
I'll see you at my place at 9:00.

876
00:56:02,237 --> 00:56:04,741
OK, Ana.

877
00:56:04,824 --> 00:56:06,033
'Bye.

878
00:56:07,702 --> 00:56:08,911
Everything all right?

879
00:56:09,453 --> 00:56:10,537
Yes.

880
00:56:11,413 --> 00:56:12,956
You seem worried.

881
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:14,958
We're running late.

882
00:56:15,167 --> 00:56:16,668
I'll see if Dana's ready.

883
00:56:16,753 --> 00:56:19,839
If I skip tonight's event,
we could have dinner together.

884
00:56:19,922 --> 00:56:21,465
No, I can't tonight.

885
00:56:21,548 --> 00:56:23,383
I'm going to shake them up.

886
00:56:26,094 --> 00:56:27,262
How do I look?

887
00:56:27,346 --> 00:56:29,431
It'll be easy to show
how beautiful you are.

888
00:56:29,514 --> 00:56:31,600
I'm a bit nervous.

889
00:56:31,683 --> 00:56:33,560
It'll be very easy.

890
00:56:33,644 --> 00:56:37,564
You know it's my first time
on the cover of a women's magazine?

891
00:56:37,648 --> 00:56:39,859
It was about time!

892
00:56:40,860 --> 00:56:44,696
If you like, we can start lying down.

893
00:56:44,781 --> 00:56:47,491
If you're uncomfortable about anything,
tell me.

894
00:56:47,742 --> 00:56:48,868
Like this?

895
00:56:48,951 --> 00:56:50,787
Like that, very good to start with.

896
00:56:51,913 --> 00:56:53,580
I love how that looks on you.

897
00:56:55,374 --> 00:56:57,710
You just keep moving around,
as you wish,

898
00:56:57,794 --> 00:56:59,127
however you're comfortable.

899
00:57:05,342 --> 00:57:06,176
Very good.

900
00:57:07,052 --> 00:57:08,262
Yes, stay like that.

901
00:57:08,971 --> 00:57:10,514
Perfect.

902
00:57:13,726 --> 00:57:14,685
Very good.

903
00:57:32,244 --> 00:57:33,495
It's Ana.

904
00:57:42,922 --> 00:57:44,673
Hello.

905
00:57:44,757 --> 00:57:46,383
How are you?

906
00:57:46,466 --> 00:57:48,468
I'm making a potato omelet.

907
00:57:48,552 --> 00:57:49,970
Will you help me?

908
00:57:52,514 --> 00:57:53,766
Where's Cecilia?

909
00:57:53,850 --> 00:57:55,475
I've just got her to sleep.

910
00:57:55,893 --> 00:57:57,854
You can see her later.

911
00:57:57,936 --> 00:57:59,521
Have you ever peeled potatoes?

912
00:58:00,272 --> 00:58:03,483
No, I've peeled oranges, apples...

913
00:58:03,567 --> 00:58:07,112
It isn't the same,
take this and watch me.

914
00:58:07,905 --> 00:58:09,156
You see?

915
00:58:11,325 --> 00:58:12,744
Like this.

916
00:58:13,201 --> 00:58:15,287
-It's easy.
-Very easy.

917
00:58:16,121 --> 00:58:18,750
Now you wash them,
go on.

918
00:58:19,458 --> 00:58:21,126
Shake them,

919
00:58:21,335 --> 00:58:23,170
to get rid of the grit.

920
00:58:25,798 --> 00:58:28,675
The most important thing
is how you cut them.

921
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:30,636
Take that pink knife.

922
00:58:35,515 --> 00:58:38,602
What's important
is the thickness of each slice.

923
00:58:38,685 --> 00:58:39,812
The thickness.

924
00:58:39,896 --> 00:58:40,938
Look.

925
00:58:43,733 --> 00:58:44,983
Like this, very fine.

926
00:58:45,067 --> 00:58:46,736
Without cutting yourself.

927
00:58:51,073 --> 00:58:52,784
How much do they pay you at the bar?

928
00:58:54,159 --> 00:58:55,953
500 euros plus tips.

929
00:58:58,080 --> 00:59:01,124
I was thinking that Dolores
might be leaving me soon.

930
00:59:01,208 --> 00:59:02,710
Her husband is very ill.

931
00:59:02,794 --> 00:59:06,421
If I want to keep working,
I'll have to find someone.

932
00:59:06,505 --> 00:59:07,422
Of course.

933
00:59:08,090 --> 00:59:10,175
I could give you 800 euros,

934
00:59:10,384 --> 00:59:12,720
without tips, but with room and board.

935
00:59:13,470 --> 00:59:15,681
Are you asking me to work here?

936
00:59:16,891 --> 00:59:17,933
Yes.

937
00:59:18,016 --> 00:59:19,894
What do I have to do?

938
00:59:20,185 --> 00:59:22,646
Look after Cecilia and the house.

939
00:59:22,730 --> 00:59:25,023
Take her to and from daycare.

940
00:59:25,232 --> 00:59:28,778
Look after her at night,
because I'm really exhausted.

941
00:59:28,861 --> 00:59:31,321
I'll give you a hand
when I'm free.

942
00:59:31,530 --> 00:59:34,449
Of course, it's a deal.

943
00:59:35,242 --> 00:59:37,829
Think about it, it isn't any favor.

944
00:59:37,912 --> 00:59:40,080
I'm almost taking advantage of you.

945
00:59:40,163 --> 00:59:42,207
No, I don't need to think.

946
00:59:42,416 --> 00:59:45,002
I'd love to do it.

947
00:59:46,586 --> 00:59:47,963
Isn't it beautiful!

948
00:59:54,303 --> 00:59:57,556
I don't know if I'm prepared
for what you're asking.

949
00:59:59,933 --> 01:00:03,061
I'll teach you
how to run a house and cook.

950
01:00:03,145 --> 01:00:06,106
But right now I really need you
to look after Cecilia.

951
01:00:07,608 --> 01:00:08,735
OK.

952
01:00:10,569 --> 01:00:13,865
If you don't like it,
you can go back to the bar.

953
01:00:13,947 --> 01:00:17,534
But you have to commit
to at least a week.

954
01:00:17,827 --> 01:00:20,788
I'm delighted, really.

955
01:00:23,081 --> 01:00:24,709
Look at that beautiful girl.

956
01:00:33,550 --> 01:00:35,052
And she likes you.

957
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:38,513
She's so cute, and so good.

958
01:00:41,016 --> 01:00:42,894
Good.

959
01:00:42,976 --> 01:00:46,146
Very good, my love.

960
01:00:46,647 --> 01:00:48,273
What about your mother?

961
01:00:49,274 --> 01:00:51,318
I told her I've moved out.

962
01:00:51,526 --> 01:00:53,863
-She was stunned.
-I can imagine.

963
01:00:54,864 --> 01:00:56,406
She flipped.

964
01:00:56,949 --> 01:00:58,868
She was furious with me.

965
01:00:58,951 --> 01:01:00,953
I'm not surprised,
she's your mother.

966
01:01:01,036 --> 01:01:02,789
She went off on a tour

967
01:01:02,872 --> 01:01:05,290
when I was in the middle
of a depression.

968
01:01:10,045 --> 01:01:11,546
I was in a terrible place,

969
01:01:11,630 --> 01:01:13,590
but now I want to live.

970
01:01:13,841 --> 01:01:16,551
It's the only lesson
I've learned from my mother.

971
01:01:17,094 --> 01:01:19,221
Live my life and be free.

972
01:01:21,390 --> 01:01:23,684
It's what she's always done.

973
01:01:25,812 --> 01:01:29,314
And I rang my father to tell him
I'm staying in Madrid to work.

974
01:01:29,398 --> 01:01:30,315
What did he say?

975
01:01:32,777 --> 01:01:35,988
He was really pissed,
but I don't care.

976
01:01:36,906 --> 01:01:39,826
I might change my number
so I won't have to listen to him.

977
01:01:43,203 --> 01:01:45,832
Will you unplug the camera?

978
01:02:00,262 --> 01:02:02,097
Wait, I'll help you.

979
01:02:06,769 --> 01:02:09,021
Put your things in the closet.

980
01:02:15,402 --> 01:02:17,905
I have a co-sleeping crib too,

981
01:02:17,988 --> 01:02:20,365
and a little stroller.

982
01:02:21,325 --> 01:02:23,035
Well, I've got everything.

983
01:02:23,118 --> 01:02:26,079
If you want anything,
I can get it from my mother's house.

984
01:02:26,163 --> 01:02:27,581
I have the keys.

985
01:02:28,165 --> 01:02:29,583
Thank you.

986
01:02:30,375 --> 01:02:32,712
-Do you have a bouncy chair?
-No.

987
01:02:32,795 --> 01:02:34,504
They love that.

988
01:02:34,588 --> 01:02:36,214
My Anita really enjoyed it.

989
01:02:37,466 --> 01:02:40,385
It probably still has her smell.

990
01:02:44,431 --> 01:02:46,058
That's true,
I hadn't thought about it.

991
01:03:11,667 --> 01:03:13,377
Janis...

992
01:03:13,460 --> 01:03:14,921
Are you all right?

993
01:03:15,295 --> 01:03:16,505
Yes.

994
01:03:22,177 --> 01:03:23,721
I missed her.

995
01:03:24,388 --> 01:03:26,849
-Do you want to take her?
-No.

996
01:03:27,933 --> 01:03:30,602
I have to get used to it,
and to sleeping.

997
01:03:30,686 --> 01:03:32,312
I've missed out on a lot of sleep.

998
01:03:32,396 --> 01:03:34,356
Are you sure you're all right?

999
01:03:34,648 --> 01:03:36,066
You're sweating.

1000
01:03:37,109 --> 01:03:39,862
Lie down here with us
for a while.

1001
01:03:41,739 --> 01:03:43,240
Come on.

1002
01:04:18,317 --> 01:04:20,737
-Have you had breakfast?
-No.

1003
01:04:20,944 --> 01:04:23,196
Have you brushed your teeth?
Or chewed gum?

1004
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:24,531
No, why?

1005
01:04:25,032 --> 01:04:27,659
I'm going to take
a sample of your saliva.

1006
01:04:27,869 --> 01:04:29,494
Open your mouth.

1007
01:04:29,578 --> 01:04:30,662
More.

1008
01:04:30,747 --> 01:04:32,122
It's for an analysis.

1009
01:04:33,123 --> 01:04:34,666
Is this how they do it now?

1010
01:04:34,876 --> 01:04:38,337
Yes, I'm going to get
a full analysis for you.

1011
01:04:38,420 --> 01:04:39,756
And for Cecilia too.

1012
01:04:41,716 --> 01:04:46,178
And you too, my love.

1013
01:04:53,602 --> 01:04:56,104
You're doing it very well.

1014
01:04:58,607 --> 01:05:00,359
Today you'll go with Dolores

1015
01:05:00,442 --> 01:05:03,070
so you get to know the stores
where she shops

1016
01:05:03,153 --> 01:05:04,947
and what we usually need.

1017
01:05:05,989 --> 01:05:06,949
Sure.

1018
01:05:07,366 --> 01:05:08,992
I'll write everything down.

1019
01:05:09,076 --> 01:05:10,703
I'll be back now.

1020
01:05:44,695 --> 01:05:46,864
We're going now.

1021
01:05:47,865 --> 01:05:49,784
I'll leave Cecilia at daycare

1022
01:05:49,992 --> 01:05:52,160
and then we're going shopping.

1023
01:05:52,577 --> 01:05:54,329
A kiss, my love.

1024
01:05:54,413 --> 01:05:56,749
Wave goodbye.

1025
01:05:56,833 --> 01:05:58,125
Have fun.

1026
01:05:58,208 --> 01:05:59,376
'Bye, mom.

1027
01:05:59,459 --> 01:06:01,003
See you later.

1028
01:06:15,727 --> 01:06:18,270
RESULT ON BIOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION
OF MATERNITY

1029
01:06:20,188 --> 01:06:23,776
ANA MANSO IS THE BIOLOGICAL MOTHER
OF CECILIA MARTÍNEZ

1030
01:06:23,860 --> 01:06:27,739
PROBABILITY 99.9%

1031
01:07:01,438 --> 01:07:02,606
Teresa?

1032
01:07:02,689 --> 01:07:03,733
Hello, Janis.

1033
01:07:03,816 --> 01:07:05,067
Is this a bad time?

1034
01:07:05,150 --> 01:07:07,110
I was working.

1035
01:07:07,194 --> 01:07:08,738
I'm sorry, is Ana here?

1036
01:07:08,946 --> 01:07:09,988
No.

1037
01:07:10,072 --> 01:07:12,157
They told me in the bar I'd find her here.

1038
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:15,243
She'll be back in a while.
But come in.

1039
01:07:19,665 --> 01:07:22,292
This is my day off
and I came on the train,

1040
01:07:22,376 --> 01:07:24,628
but I've got a show tomorrow in Barcelona.

1041
01:07:24,712 --> 01:07:27,214
Can I get you anything?
A coffee?

1042
01:07:27,297 --> 01:07:28,841
Brandy?

1043
01:07:30,425 --> 01:07:32,928
I think Dolores
keeps something around here.

1044
01:07:33,553 --> 01:07:36,891
At times she drinks
because her husband is very ill.

1045
01:07:37,099 --> 01:07:38,183
Oh, dear.

1046
01:07:41,186 --> 01:07:42,521
Do you smoke?

1047
01:07:42,897 --> 01:07:44,189
All right.

1048
01:07:44,690 --> 01:07:45,900
But on the terrace.

1049
01:07:46,108 --> 01:07:47,150
Of course.

1050
01:07:53,741 --> 01:07:55,993
I'll get a jacket, it's cold.

1051
01:08:15,137 --> 01:08:17,222
I don't know what Ana's told you about me.

1052
01:08:18,599 --> 01:08:19,600
Very little.

1053
01:08:26,105 --> 01:08:28,275
I married to get away from my parents.

1054
01:08:28,358 --> 01:08:29,985
A year later Ana was born.

1055
01:08:30,652 --> 01:08:33,697
But I had no calling
to be a mother or a wife.

1056
01:08:34,197 --> 01:08:35,908
I wanted to be in the theater.

1057
01:08:35,991 --> 01:08:38,034
I'd done it at university.

1058
01:08:38,243 --> 01:08:41,954
So I divorced Ana's father
through the Roman Rota.

1059
01:08:42,163 --> 01:08:43,874
You can't imagine that...

1060
01:08:43,957 --> 01:08:45,877
A horrific humiliation.

1061
01:08:47,043 --> 01:08:51,381
You practically had to say you were
a whore so they'd annul your marriage.

1062
01:08:52,466 --> 01:08:54,676
I accepted all the humiliations

1063
01:08:54,761 --> 01:08:57,722
so I could be free
and devote myself to acting.

1064
01:08:58,931 --> 01:09:01,558
Fortunately, money wasn't a problem.

1065
01:09:03,518 --> 01:09:05,979
The father got custody of Ana.

1066
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:09,565
He remarried immediately
and had another family in Granada.

1067
01:09:10,275 --> 01:09:11,318
He's still there.

1068
01:09:13,028 --> 01:09:14,739
But you still saw Ana, didn't you?

1069
01:09:17,699 --> 01:09:20,202
The father took his revenge on me
through Ana.

1070
01:09:20,828 --> 01:09:22,705
He hardly let me see her.

1071
01:09:22,789 --> 01:09:25,582
He put up lots of obstacles
to make me suffer.

1072
01:09:26,375 --> 01:09:29,586
I did small parts
in theater and on television

1073
01:09:29,670 --> 01:09:31,838
and suffered from seeing her so rarely.

1074
01:09:31,923 --> 01:09:34,216
In the end, it wasn't worth
giving her up.

1075
01:09:35,425 --> 01:09:37,386
I started late to be an actress.

1076
01:09:37,469 --> 01:09:40,346
30 is already late for starting

1077
01:09:41,223 --> 01:09:44,268
and looking posh
doesn't help in this profession.

1078
01:09:45,060 --> 01:09:49,105
It isn't a profession for the posh.
Actors are all left wing.

1079
01:09:49,314 --> 01:09:50,274
And what are you?

1080
01:09:50,357 --> 01:09:53,861
I'm apolitical,
my job is to please everyone.

1081
01:09:59,408 --> 01:10:01,284
How did you get Ana back?

1082
01:10:01,618 --> 01:10:04,288
Her father sent her to me
when she got pregnant.

1083
01:10:04,371 --> 01:10:08,000
You could have taken the chance
to win her back.

1084
01:10:08,083 --> 01:10:09,626
Yes.

1085
01:10:10,460 --> 01:10:12,587
But I'm hopeless,

1086
01:10:14,256 --> 01:10:15,717
and it was a bit late.

1087
01:10:16,801 --> 01:10:18,845
Ana was traumatized.

1088
01:10:19,678 --> 01:10:21,096
We were two strangers.

1089
01:10:22,514 --> 01:10:24,474
I did what I could,

1090
01:10:24,558 --> 01:10:27,311
but after a few months
the Lorca came up.

1091
01:10:28,270 --> 01:10:30,981
Immediately after,
the opposite character,

1092
01:10:31,064 --> 01:10:34,026
the junky mother in
<i>Long Day's Journey Into Night.</i>

1093
01:10:34,109 --> 01:10:36,445
I couldn't say no.

1094
01:10:37,029 --> 01:10:38,989
I'm 47,

1095
01:10:39,072 --> 01:10:42,910
and I had to grab the chance
to prove that I'm not an intruder,

1096
01:10:43,327 --> 01:10:45,705
that I'm an actress with talent.

1097
01:10:49,166 --> 01:10:51,168
I was the worst mother in the world,

1098
01:10:51,376 --> 01:10:52,461
I know.

1099
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:54,171
I'm not like you.

1100
01:10:54,254 --> 01:10:56,632
I don't have a maternal instinct.

1101
01:10:58,258 --> 01:10:59,384
It sounds terrible.

1102
01:11:01,303 --> 01:11:03,180
I'm sorry for Ana,

1103
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:06,308
she was very unfortunate
with both of us,

1104
01:11:06,391 --> 01:11:07,852
her father and me.

1105
01:11:08,853 --> 01:11:11,313
No one deserves
what she's been through.

1106
01:11:13,273 --> 01:11:15,692
When Anita died,

1107
01:11:15,777 --> 01:11:18,028
I was doing a season in Madrid.

1108
01:11:18,738 --> 01:11:22,867
But after a month I had to leave,
and it broke my heart.

1109
01:11:23,743 --> 01:11:25,202
Honestly,

1110
01:11:25,452 --> 01:11:28,038
I left because Ana didn't seem
to care if I did.

1111
01:11:32,584 --> 01:11:37,130
Do you think that the baby died
because of the situation you were in?

1112
01:11:37,214 --> 01:11:38,340
No!

1113
01:11:39,049 --> 01:11:40,425
Didn't Ana tell you?

1114
01:11:40,718 --> 01:11:43,178
A crib death, the doctor said.

1115
01:11:43,387 --> 01:11:45,472
An hour before, she was normal.

1116
01:11:46,306 --> 01:11:48,308
Ours isn't exactly a model family,

1117
01:11:49,184 --> 01:11:51,436
but Anita never wanted for anything.

1118
01:11:52,062 --> 01:11:54,940
Ana never left her daughter,
day or night.

1119
01:11:57,150 --> 01:11:59,027
Ana really surprised me.

1120
01:12:00,696 --> 01:12:04,074
After she gave birth
she suddenly became a grown woman,

1121
01:12:05,158 --> 01:12:07,244
responsible.

1122
01:12:08,245 --> 01:12:10,707
The baby never wanted for anything.

1123
01:12:12,249 --> 01:12:14,711
Maybe that's why I allowed myself...

1124
01:12:15,712 --> 01:12:17,504
We're back!

1125
01:12:22,467 --> 01:12:23,845
Mom, what are you doing here?

1126
01:12:23,927 --> 01:12:25,722
I've come to see you.

1127
01:12:26,764 --> 01:12:29,558
Would you like to go to your room
and have some privacy?

1128
01:12:29,641 --> 01:12:32,603
No, we'll go out to the street.

1129
01:12:32,686 --> 01:12:33,730
Yes.

1130
01:12:36,607 --> 01:12:38,776
Thank you, for everything.

1131
01:12:38,860 --> 01:12:39,985
You're welcome.

1132
01:12:40,611 --> 01:12:42,029
Won't you feel cold?

1133
01:12:43,155 --> 01:12:45,407
No, I love this jacket.

1134
01:12:48,285 --> 01:12:51,789
You didn't have to leave home
to change your hairstyle.

1135
01:12:54,166 --> 01:12:55,500
Do you live here?

1136
01:12:55,584 --> 01:12:57,127
Yes, in Janis' house.

1137
01:12:57,210 --> 01:12:58,629
And what do you do there?

1138
01:12:58,713 --> 01:13:00,798
I look after the house and the child.

1139
01:13:00,882 --> 01:13:02,759
You're working as a maid?

1140
01:13:03,133 --> 01:13:04,509
I can't believe it.

1141
01:13:04,593 --> 01:13:06,553
Did we give you an education for that?

1142
01:13:07,930 --> 01:13:09,807
Mom, I have to work.

1143
01:13:09,891 --> 01:13:12,810
Your father can find you
a decent job in Granada.

1144
01:13:12,894 --> 01:13:14,937
Don't talk to me
about my father or Granada.

1145
01:13:17,022 --> 01:13:18,607
Hey, Ana! How are you?

1146
01:13:18,690 --> 01:13:19,608
Hello.

1147
01:13:19,691 --> 01:13:20,777
What'll you have?

1148
01:13:20,860 --> 01:13:22,527
A tea for me, please.

1149
01:13:22,611 --> 01:13:24,321
A strawberry ice cream.

1150
01:13:24,529 --> 01:13:26,239
Thanks.

1151
01:13:34,832 --> 01:13:38,335
After Anita died I heard you
arguing with dad on the phone.

1152
01:13:39,086 --> 01:13:42,005
It didn't suit either of you to have me.

1153
01:13:42,757 --> 01:13:45,050
I was too depressed to make a decision

1154
01:13:45,133 --> 01:13:49,137
but as soon as I could get up
I left home and I'm not going back.

1155
01:13:49,221 --> 01:13:51,056
And much less to his house.

1156
01:13:52,266 --> 01:13:53,768
I'm an adult,

1157
01:13:53,851 --> 01:13:55,728
so you live your lives
and I'll live mine.

1158
01:14:05,362 --> 01:14:08,949
Now we put the fish
on top of the potatoes

1159
01:14:09,826 --> 01:14:14,621
and if it dries out
we add a little bit of wine.

1160
01:14:15,038 --> 01:14:16,206
OK.

1161
01:14:24,589 --> 01:14:25,632
It's my mother.

1162
01:14:26,675 --> 01:14:28,051
Apologizing.

1163
01:14:31,263 --> 01:14:32,849
Answer her.

1164
01:14:35,350 --> 01:14:38,020
I don't know,
I don't want to be more cruel to her.

1165
01:14:38,103 --> 01:14:40,105
Well, say that.

1166
01:14:40,397 --> 01:14:42,900
Mom, I don't want
to be more cruel to you.

1167
01:14:43,942 --> 01:14:46,863
Go on, she'll love it.

1168
01:15:08,843 --> 01:15:10,510
Who's that hippy?

1169
01:15:11,178 --> 01:15:12,805
My mother.

1170
01:15:14,431 --> 01:15:17,601
-Are you the baby?
-Yes.

1171
01:15:17,894 --> 01:15:21,521
I was just a few weeks old there,
we were in Ibiza.

1172
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:25,735
You know she called me
after Janis Joplin?

1173
01:15:28,946 --> 01:15:30,907
Who's Janis Joplin?

1174
01:15:32,074 --> 01:15:33,785
That's her singing.

1175
01:15:37,371 --> 01:15:42,459
My mother also died at 27
from an overdose.

1176
01:15:44,127 --> 01:15:46,463
It was summertime
and the living wasn't easy.

1177
01:15:48,048 --> 01:15:51,593
I was five, but I was already living
in my town with my grandmother.

1178
01:15:53,971 --> 01:15:55,472
Is that your grandmother?

1179
01:15:55,681 --> 01:15:57,307
That's my great-grandmother.

1180
01:15:58,976 --> 01:16:01,019
This is my grandmother Cecilia.

1181
01:16:01,478 --> 01:16:04,231
She took care of me and reared me.

1182
01:16:06,942 --> 01:16:10,570
One day you'll have to come
and see the house where we lived.

1183
01:16:13,407 --> 01:16:14,574
Whenever you want.

1184
01:16:16,994 --> 01:16:18,954
To your grandmother Cecilia,

1185
01:16:21,665 --> 01:16:23,417
to your mother,

1186
01:16:27,004 --> 01:16:28,964
to your daughter,

1187
01:16:33,886 --> 01:16:35,095
and to you.

1188
01:16:35,971 --> 01:16:37,180
And to you.

1189
01:17:56,260 --> 01:17:58,136
It's here.

1190
01:18:04,727 --> 01:18:07,730
FOREVER LOVED BY YOUR MOTHER ANA
AND YOUR GRANDMOTHER TERESA

1191
01:18:21,451 --> 01:18:24,413
Did you tell the father
that the baby died?

1192
01:18:24,496 --> 01:18:26,081
I don't know who he is.

1193
01:18:27,082 --> 01:18:29,501
Aren't you curious to know?

1194
01:18:30,335 --> 01:18:34,089
There were three of them, classmates.

1195
01:18:35,132 --> 01:18:39,136
We were really drunk and high
in the home of one of them,

1196
01:18:39,219 --> 01:18:40,971
the one I liked.

1197
01:18:41,054 --> 01:18:44,057
His parents were away
for the weekend.

1198
01:18:44,809 --> 01:18:46,476
I was really blasted.

1199
01:18:46,853 --> 01:18:50,939
I screwed with the one I liked
but the others had filmed us on a phone

1200
01:18:51,023 --> 01:18:53,776
and they threatened
to post it on Internet

1201
01:18:53,860 --> 01:18:56,153
if I didn't do it with them too,

1202
01:18:56,236 --> 01:18:58,071
and I had to screw them.

1203
01:18:58,488 --> 01:18:59,824
But that's rape!

1204
01:19:00,532 --> 01:19:03,493
Two days later
they said the same thing,

1205
01:19:03,577 --> 01:19:06,413
either I screwed them again
or they'd post the video.

1206
01:19:07,205 --> 01:19:09,709
So I went to my father
and told him.

1207
01:19:09,792 --> 01:19:12,669
-And he reported them?
-No.

1208
01:19:12,879 --> 01:19:14,797
He wanted to avoid a scandal,

1209
01:19:14,881 --> 01:19:16,340
and also for my sake.

1210
01:19:16,423 --> 01:19:17,549
Your sake?

1211
01:19:17,633 --> 01:19:21,553
Yes, so I wouldn't have to suffer
the pressure from the media and all.

1212
01:19:22,764 --> 01:19:26,433
When I found out I was pregnant,
he sent me to my mother.

1213
01:19:27,184 --> 01:19:28,895
You should have reported it.

1214
01:19:28,977 --> 01:19:32,648
Those boys might keep on raping
if they're not stopped.

1215
01:19:32,857 --> 01:19:34,776
I didn't have the strength.

1216
01:19:35,150 --> 01:19:38,821
I was terrified about a trial,
the police, the press.

1217
01:19:39,529 --> 01:19:42,950
I didn't want to relive it over and over.

1218
01:19:48,538 --> 01:19:49,539
Look.

1219
01:19:51,918 --> 01:19:53,585
That's them?

1220
01:20:12,646 --> 01:20:14,982
Go to sleep.

1221
01:20:15,065 --> 01:20:16,233
Give her a kiss.

1222
01:20:18,193 --> 01:20:20,320
Go on, chubby cheeks.

1223
01:20:24,199 --> 01:20:25,242
Elena?

1224
01:20:25,325 --> 01:20:26,869
I doubt it, she'd have called.

1225
01:20:26,952 --> 01:20:28,161
I'll go and see.

1226
01:20:28,245 --> 01:20:29,579
I'll put her down.

1227
01:20:31,581 --> 01:20:34,126
No more joking around.

1228
01:20:35,961 --> 01:20:37,254
Who is it?

1229
01:20:37,337 --> 01:20:38,380
<i>It's Arturo.</i>

1230
01:20:38,756 --> 01:20:39,589
Hello.

1231
01:20:39,841 --> 01:20:44,011
I've called you several times
but something's wrong with your number.

1232
01:20:44,094 --> 01:20:45,888
<i>Yes, I changed it.</i>

1233
01:20:46,723 --> 01:20:49,057
I've got great news,

1234
01:20:49,141 --> 01:20:51,101
but I'd like to see your face
when I tell you.

1235
01:20:51,643 --> 01:20:53,395
Wait for me in the tavern.

1236
01:20:53,478 --> 01:20:54,646
I'll be right down.

1237
01:20:54,731 --> 01:20:55,606
<i>Great.</i>

1238
01:20:56,607 --> 01:20:57,775
Who was it?

1239
01:20:58,358 --> 01:21:00,694
An old friend,
I'm going to meet him.

1240
01:21:03,071 --> 01:21:05,115
I changed my number
and he couldn't find me,

1241
01:21:05,198 --> 01:21:06,575
so he came here.

1242
01:21:07,534 --> 01:21:09,620
Why didn't you ask him up?

1243
01:21:09,704 --> 01:21:12,497
I feel like some fresh air.

1244
01:21:16,001 --> 01:21:17,419
And dinner?

1245
01:21:17,795 --> 01:21:19,338
Are you going to eat here?

1246
01:21:19,421 --> 01:21:21,173
I don't think so.

1247
01:21:24,217 --> 01:21:26,094
What would you like to have?

1248
01:21:26,888 --> 01:21:29,681
A cold white wine.

1249
01:21:29,766 --> 01:21:31,975
To celebrate what you have to tell me.

1250
01:21:32,184 --> 01:21:33,560
You promised it's good.

1251
01:21:33,644 --> 01:21:34,771
Yes.

1252
01:21:34,854 --> 01:21:37,606
The foundation has decided
to open your grave in July.

1253
01:21:37,689 --> 01:21:39,650
You're going to open our grave?

1254
01:21:41,026 --> 01:21:42,820
But that's in three months.

1255
01:21:42,904 --> 01:21:46,406
The board will inform you officially
if you can give me a number.

1256
01:21:46,949 --> 01:21:48,617
I'll do that right now.

1257
01:21:48,701 --> 01:21:50,285
Have you got a pen?

1258
01:21:52,037 --> 01:21:53,455
In July?

1259
01:21:53,997 --> 01:21:55,499
I'll direct the excavation,

1260
01:21:55,582 --> 01:21:57,668
the foundation supplies
the technical means.

1261
01:21:58,168 --> 01:21:59,837
I don't know how to thank you.

1262
01:21:59,921 --> 01:22:01,756
There's nothing to thank,

1263
01:22:01,839 --> 01:22:03,800
that's why I dared come directly
to your house.

1264
01:22:05,259 --> 01:22:07,386
This is my new number.

1265
01:22:08,763 --> 01:22:10,681
Were you avoiding me?

1266
01:22:10,765 --> 01:22:11,974
You? No, heavens!

1267
01:22:12,975 --> 01:22:15,143
It's a long story,

1268
01:22:15,227 --> 01:22:16,687
I'll tell you one day.

1269
01:22:16,771 --> 01:22:19,523
You look wonderful.
Is everything OK?

1270
01:22:19,606 --> 01:22:22,860
I'm working a lot,
but it's all good.

1271
01:22:23,068 --> 01:22:23,903
And Cecilia?

1272
01:22:24,111 --> 01:22:25,612
She's great.

1273
01:22:25,696 --> 01:22:28,156
-And you, your family?
-Fine.

1274
01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:31,451
My wife has fully recovered,
according to the doctors.

1275
01:22:31,869 --> 01:22:33,370
I'm delighted.

1276
01:22:33,453 --> 01:22:35,455
We're separating.

1277
01:22:36,916 --> 01:22:38,000
I told her about us.

1278
01:22:38,208 --> 01:22:40,168
Now? Why?

1279
01:22:40,252 --> 01:22:43,297
I didn't like the feeling
of hiding it from her.

1280
01:22:43,380 --> 01:22:46,675
I felt terrible having to lie to her.

1281
01:23:13,745 --> 01:23:15,495
Go back to sleep.

1282
01:23:21,878 --> 01:23:23,670
You smell of alcohol.

1283
01:23:23,755 --> 01:23:26,632
I drank a bit of wine.

1284
01:23:28,383 --> 01:23:31,345
Go back to sleep, go on.

1285
01:23:38,185 --> 01:23:40,145
I'm not awake.

1286
01:23:42,564 --> 01:23:44,691
I'm dreaming.

1287
01:23:57,872 --> 01:24:02,250
It's delicious, the wine is delicious.

1288
01:24:04,294 --> 01:24:06,756
Go back to sleep, it's very late.

1289
01:24:15,848 --> 01:24:18,183
I'm tired.

1290
01:24:26,233 --> 01:24:29,069
Were you with your friend all this time?

1291
01:24:29,278 --> 01:24:31,071
Yes.

1292
01:24:33,407 --> 01:24:34,950
Did you screw him?

1293
01:24:35,910 --> 01:24:38,036
No, why would you say that?

1294
01:24:40,372 --> 01:24:42,624
You had lots of time.

1295
01:24:44,251 --> 01:24:48,297
We were talking and drinking.

1296
01:24:48,380 --> 01:24:50,465
I'd forgotten what that was like.

1297
01:25:06,273 --> 01:25:08,483
Your friend from last night?

1298
01:25:08,818 --> 01:25:12,070
His name is Arturo
and he's the father of my child.

1299
01:25:12,279 --> 01:25:15,407
You told me you wouldn't see him again.

1300
01:25:15,490 --> 01:25:18,035
We had a lot to talk about.

1301
01:25:19,244 --> 01:25:20,747
Are you jealous?

1302
01:25:21,789 --> 01:25:24,625
I don't know.
What were you talking about?

1303
01:25:25,835 --> 01:25:28,086
I'll tell you another time, OK?

1304
01:25:28,629 --> 01:25:31,548
I'm meeting Elena for another cover,
I have to leave now.

1305
01:25:32,507 --> 01:25:33,383
And Elena?

1306
01:25:33,467 --> 01:25:34,551
What?

1307
01:25:35,552 --> 01:25:37,387
I think she likes you.

1308
01:25:37,930 --> 01:25:40,140
We've known each other forever...

1309
01:25:40,432 --> 01:25:43,018
But it's true,
I think she's always liked me.

1310
01:25:43,518 --> 01:25:46,647
In any case she respects me,
if that's what's worrying you.

1311
01:25:48,065 --> 01:25:49,524
I have to go.

1312
01:25:50,651 --> 01:25:52,945
When you want to go out, tell me.

1313
01:25:53,028 --> 01:25:55,489
I don't want you here like a prisoner.

1314
01:25:55,572 --> 01:25:56,824
All right?

1315
01:25:56,908 --> 01:25:58,743
But I want to go out with you,

1316
01:25:58,992 --> 01:26:04,039
so you can show me new places
and we can get drunk together.

1317
01:26:04,122 --> 01:26:06,083
We'll have to get drunk here,

1318
01:26:06,166 --> 01:26:08,585
because who'll look after Cecilia?

1319
01:26:08,669 --> 01:26:10,379
Don't make me late.

1320
01:26:11,588 --> 01:26:14,508
I'll have to go back
to drinking in the street.

1321
01:26:17,804 --> 01:26:20,138
So, what about your friend
from the other night?

1322
01:26:21,181 --> 01:26:23,726
-Arturo?
-Yes.

1323
01:26:24,894 --> 01:26:27,145
He's a forensic anthropologist

1324
01:26:27,730 --> 01:26:30,148
and he belongs to a scientific foundation.

1325
01:26:30,357 --> 01:26:33,235
They're going to open the grave
where my great-grandfather is.

1326
01:26:34,069 --> 01:26:37,197
That's what we were talking about,
and we were celebrating.

1327
01:26:37,406 --> 01:26:41,786
You're obsessed with the grave
and that man is taking advantage of it.

1328
01:26:42,912 --> 01:26:44,371
What?

1329
01:26:44,872 --> 01:26:46,957
You have to look to the future,

1330
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:49,877
otherwise you'll just open old wounds.

1331
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:52,004
Who said that? Your father?

1332
01:26:52,629 --> 01:26:53,715
Yes.

1333
01:26:54,256 --> 01:26:55,717
Do you think that?

1334
01:26:56,801 --> 01:26:59,136
I don't know.
I've never thought about those things.

1335
01:27:00,012 --> 01:27:02,514
It's time you knew
what country you're living in!

1336
01:27:04,726 --> 01:27:06,728
I don't like you talking to me like that.

1337
01:27:08,437 --> 01:27:11,858
No one in your family
has told you the truth about our country.

1338
01:27:12,691 --> 01:27:17,654
There are over 100,000 people missing,
buried in ditches or close to cemeteries.

1339
01:27:18,238 --> 01:27:20,783
Their grandchildren
and great-grandchildren

1340
01:27:20,867 --> 01:27:22,492
would like to disinter them

1341
01:27:22,576 --> 01:27:24,369
and give them a decent burial

1342
01:27:24,453 --> 01:27:27,080
because they promised that
to their mothers and grandmothers.

1343
01:27:27,164 --> 01:27:29,249
And until we do that,
the war won't have ended.

1344
01:27:30,918 --> 01:27:33,170
You're very young,
but it's time you knew

1345
01:27:33,378 --> 01:27:36,298
where your father and his family
were during the war.

1346
01:27:36,506 --> 01:27:37,633
You need to know,

1347
01:27:37,717 --> 01:27:40,010
so you can decide
where you want to be.

1348
01:27:43,680 --> 01:27:46,058
I just want to be where you are.

1349
01:27:46,433 --> 01:27:47,643
That isn't relevant now.

1350
01:27:47,727 --> 01:27:49,729
Don't you care
that I want to be with you?

1351
01:27:50,479 --> 01:27:51,605
Leave it.

1352
01:28:07,162 --> 01:28:08,163
Aren't you eating?

1353
01:28:09,539 --> 01:28:10,792
I'm not hungry.

1354
01:28:15,462 --> 01:28:16,798
You're tired of me, aren't you?

1355
01:28:18,590 --> 01:28:19,842
No.

1356
01:28:21,468 --> 01:28:23,178
Then what's wrong?

1357
01:28:24,554 --> 01:28:27,683
Did you sleep with Arturo
and you don't want to tell me?

1358
01:28:30,060 --> 01:28:31,311
No.

1359
01:28:33,815 --> 01:28:36,275
The problems are with myself.

1360
01:28:39,194 --> 01:28:42,072
During all these months

1361
01:28:44,074 --> 01:28:45,868
I've been keeping something from you.

1362
01:28:47,119 --> 01:28:49,496
That you don't love me
and you want me to go?

1363
01:28:50,080 --> 01:28:52,291
That you've decided
to go back to your child's father

1364
01:28:52,374 --> 01:28:53,542
and form a family with him?

1365
01:28:53,835 --> 01:28:55,043
No.

1366
01:28:55,837 --> 01:28:56,921
Then what is it?

1367
01:29:00,090 --> 01:29:01,300
Come.

1368
01:29:36,585 --> 01:29:38,921
Look carefully
at what I'm going to show you.

1369
01:29:39,004 --> 01:29:40,672
It's very important.

1370
01:29:58,941 --> 01:30:00,442
Do you understand what it says?

1371
01:30:03,612 --> 01:30:09,660
It excludes Janis Martínez
as biological mother

1372
01:30:09,744 --> 01:30:13,538
of Cecilia Martínez.

1373
01:30:17,125 --> 01:30:19,754
I'm not Cecilia's mother.

1374
01:30:21,046 --> 01:30:22,381
I don't understand.

1375
01:30:25,968 --> 01:30:27,594
Look at this other report.

1376
01:30:36,186 --> 01:30:38,105
"Biological..."

1377
01:30:38,188 --> 01:30:44,069
"Ana Manso is the biological mother
of Cecilia Martínez".

1378
01:30:46,321 --> 01:30:48,657
But I'm Ana Manso.

1379
01:30:51,869 --> 01:30:53,495
Cecilia is your daughter.

1380
01:30:53,788 --> 01:30:55,163
What?

1381
01:31:00,502 --> 01:31:02,587
I guess that...

1382
01:31:04,799 --> 01:31:06,843
they swapped them at birth.

1383
01:31:26,653 --> 01:31:28,781
"Ana Manso

1384
01:31:28,865 --> 01:31:31,701
is the biological mother

1385
01:31:31,784 --> 01:31:34,661
of Cecilia Martínez".

1386
01:31:37,372 --> 01:31:39,124
I don't understand.

1387
01:31:39,751 --> 01:31:42,544
I never did a maternity test.

1388
01:31:42,920 --> 01:31:45,882
I did it for you,
without telling you.

1389
01:31:45,964 --> 01:31:48,801
Remember when you'd just got here,
with latex gloves?

1390
01:31:49,426 --> 01:31:51,970
Why didn't you tell me before?

1391
01:31:53,639 --> 01:31:54,807
That's Cecilia,

1392
01:31:56,099 --> 01:31:57,351
I'll check on her.

1393
01:32:13,951 --> 01:32:15,912
My little princess.

1394
01:32:17,537 --> 01:32:19,874
<i>My daughter.</i>

1395
01:33:11,133 --> 01:33:13,135
Are you my little girl?

1396
01:33:47,377 --> 01:33:49,004
Janis,

1397
01:33:49,087 --> 01:33:50,798
I'm going crazy.

1398
01:33:51,799 --> 01:33:53,843
Are those reports true?

1399
01:33:55,218 --> 01:33:57,304
Why would I lie to you about this?

1400
01:33:57,387 --> 01:33:59,598
But where's your daughter?

1401
01:33:59,807 --> 01:34:01,183
What have you done with her?

1402
01:34:01,768 --> 01:34:02,769
They swapped them,

1403
01:34:02,852 --> 01:34:04,186
I told you.

1404
01:34:06,856 --> 01:34:09,650
You mean that my Anita was yours?

1405
01:34:11,485 --> 01:34:12,737
I'm sure of it.

1406
01:34:14,029 --> 01:34:17,699
They must have changed them
the day they were in observation.

1407
01:34:19,326 --> 01:34:21,119
Since when have you known?

1408
01:34:21,453 --> 01:34:24,456
When you came here I already knew
that I wasn't Cecilia's mother

1409
01:34:24,665 --> 01:34:26,458
and Arturo wasn't the father.

1410
01:34:26,541 --> 01:34:29,378
We both had doubts,
that's why I did the test.

1411
01:34:29,461 --> 01:34:31,881
So you already knew
when I told you Anita had died?

1412
01:34:32,381 --> 01:34:33,925
Yes.

1413
01:34:38,053 --> 01:34:41,556
I was going to tell you
about my suspicions, I swear.

1414
01:34:41,766 --> 01:34:44,434
I called you, as soon as I found out,

1415
01:34:45,394 --> 01:34:46,979
but I backed out.

1416
01:34:48,313 --> 01:34:50,817
When I invited you for dinner
the first time,

1417
01:34:50,900 --> 01:34:53,151
after meeting you at the café,

1418
01:34:53,235 --> 01:34:54,821
I was going to tell you.

1419
01:34:56,321 --> 01:34:58,908
But when you said that your daughter...

1420
01:34:59,408 --> 01:35:00,910
who would be mine...

1421
01:35:01,618 --> 01:35:03,537
had died...

1422
01:35:06,874 --> 01:35:08,041
I couldn't do it.

1423
01:35:12,087 --> 01:35:15,758
I was terrified of losing two children
at the same time.

1424
01:35:15,842 --> 01:35:17,760
You never thought about me?

1425
01:35:17,844 --> 01:35:19,261
All the time.

1426
01:35:19,970 --> 01:35:22,180
You never put yourself in my place.

1427
01:35:22,264 --> 01:35:25,893
Living together, sleeping together...

1428
01:35:27,185 --> 01:35:31,481
You kept it quiet all these months
and didn't give a damn about me.

1429
01:35:34,109 --> 01:35:35,944
Is that why you changed your number?

1430
01:35:37,154 --> 01:35:38,906
So I couldn't find you?

1431
01:35:40,991 --> 01:35:42,492
I guess so.

1432
01:35:52,169 --> 01:35:54,881
Yes, mom.
I'll explain it all.

1433
01:35:55,923 --> 01:35:58,050
I'm bringing Cecilia with me.

1434
01:35:59,301 --> 01:36:02,220
Not the mother,
I'm going on my own with her.

1435
01:36:04,431 --> 01:36:07,225
No, I'm going to take a taxi.

1436
01:36:08,101 --> 01:36:10,520
I'll see you soon.

1437
01:36:11,271 --> 01:36:12,774
What are you going to do?

1438
01:36:14,024 --> 01:36:16,234
I'm going to my mother's house
with Cecilia.

1439
01:36:17,069 --> 01:36:18,946
She's very happy.

1440
01:36:19,655 --> 01:36:20,865
Did you tell her?

1441
01:36:21,573 --> 01:36:22,950
Not yet.

1442
01:36:25,285 --> 01:36:27,496
Stay, please.

1443
01:36:27,579 --> 01:36:31,876
Please, give me time
to get used to the idea.

1444
01:36:34,378 --> 01:36:37,089
It's best if we separate

1445
01:36:37,799 --> 01:36:40,300
so I can take all this in.

1446
01:36:45,848 --> 01:36:49,101
But can't we analyze
the situation here,

1447
01:36:49,184 --> 01:36:51,687
together, like two adults?

1448
01:36:53,939 --> 01:36:57,860
The hardest part was telling you

1449
01:36:59,569 --> 01:37:01,071
and I've done that.

1450
01:37:07,619 --> 01:37:09,621
I can't bear you taking her away.

1451
01:37:12,249 --> 01:37:14,209
You've complicated things too much.

1452
01:37:15,878 --> 01:37:17,714
We'll have time to talk later.

1453
01:37:23,260 --> 01:37:25,012
Up you come.

1454
01:37:46,617 --> 01:37:48,368
Can you take the bags?

1455
01:37:53,540 --> 01:37:55,542
Let's go.

1456
01:38:10,098 --> 01:38:13,393
My darling, I love you very much.

1457
01:38:16,521 --> 01:38:17,815
Goodbye, sweetheart.

1458
01:39:13,537 --> 01:39:14,706
<i>Yes?</i>

1459
01:39:14,789 --> 01:39:18,041
Arturo... It's Janis.

1460
01:39:18,125 --> 01:39:19,334
Are you in Madrid?

1461
01:39:19,418 --> 01:39:20,878
<i>Yes. Is something wrong?</i>

1462
01:39:21,086 --> 01:39:22,587
Can you come, please?

1463
01:39:22,839 --> 01:39:25,048
She has some of my mother's features.

1464
01:39:29,261 --> 01:39:33,932
It was horrific to find her
when she was already dead.

1465
01:40:04,212 --> 01:40:05,840
Hello.

1466
01:40:05,923 --> 01:40:06,883
Did I wake you?

1467
01:40:07,466 --> 01:40:09,176
Ana...

1468
01:40:10,218 --> 01:40:13,013
I'm groggy from the tranquilizers.

1469
01:40:13,680 --> 01:40:17,142
I'm sorry that I left like that,
but it was...

1470
01:40:17,225 --> 01:40:20,979
It was a very difficult situation,
and I'm responsible.

1471
01:40:21,731 --> 01:40:24,149
It's fair that I'm punished.

1472
01:40:24,441 --> 01:40:26,485
I'm not punishing you.

1473
01:40:26,568 --> 01:40:28,654
You can come and see her
when you like.

1474
01:40:29,529 --> 01:40:31,198
Thank you.

1475
01:40:32,157 --> 01:40:34,368
I'm much calmer now.

1476
01:40:35,369 --> 01:40:37,747
<i>It isn't easy to understand all at once,</i>

1477
01:40:37,955 --> 01:40:39,749
<i>but I'm worried about you.</i>

1478
01:40:39,957 --> 01:40:42,877
We have to sort this out between us.

1479
01:40:43,168 --> 01:40:45,045
The worst was last night.

1480
01:40:45,838 --> 01:40:49,383
Now I have to detach myself
gradually from Cecilia.

1481
01:40:50,300 --> 01:40:52,928
I'd come and see you right now,

1482
01:40:54,137 --> 01:40:56,056
<i>but it's best if I wait a few days.</i>

1483
01:40:56,139 --> 01:40:58,684
You can't stop seeing her
just like that.

1484
01:40:58,768 --> 01:41:01,687
No, of course not.

1485
01:41:02,688 --> 01:41:05,023
I'll call you when I feel up to
seeing you.

1486
01:41:05,107 --> 01:41:07,735
We have to talk about us too.

1487
01:41:07,943 --> 01:41:09,569
I don't know where I stand with you.

1488
01:41:11,446 --> 01:41:12,322
Yes.

1489
01:41:13,198 --> 01:41:15,785
We'll talk about everything,
whenever you want.

1490
01:41:17,494 --> 01:41:19,162
Kisses.

1491
01:41:58,745 --> 01:42:00,454
Here.

1492
01:42:00,537 --> 01:42:02,497
They told us it was here.

1493
01:42:04,625 --> 01:42:07,085
First we'll visit the woman who's ill.

1494
01:42:07,169 --> 01:42:08,462
Aunt Brígida.

1495
01:42:08,962 --> 01:42:10,840
She may not even last to July.

1496
01:42:11,590 --> 01:42:13,675
The two granddaughters
will be there too.

1497
01:42:14,343 --> 01:42:15,177
Perfect.

1498
01:42:22,935 --> 01:42:24,812
Janis, this is wonderful!

1499
01:42:25,687 --> 01:42:27,314
I'm so happy to see you!

1500
01:42:27,732 --> 01:42:29,274
You look beautiful!

1501
01:42:29,358 --> 01:42:30,442
And so do you.

1502
01:42:30,984 --> 01:42:32,152
This is Arturo.

1503
01:42:32,235 --> 01:42:33,738
He's heading the excavation.

1504
01:42:33,821 --> 01:42:35,405
Delighted.

1505
01:42:35,489 --> 01:42:36,866
-And your grandma?
-She's inside.

1506
01:42:36,949 --> 01:42:38,785
She dozed off waiting for you.

1507
01:42:38,992 --> 01:42:41,203
She was so anxious
she didn't sleep last night.

1508
01:42:41,286 --> 01:42:42,245
Go on in.

1509
01:42:42,329 --> 01:42:43,205
Thank you.

1510
01:42:46,667 --> 01:42:48,543
Grandma, they're here.

1511
01:42:48,627 --> 01:42:50,295
Aunt Brígida!

1512
01:42:51,129 --> 01:42:52,381
Don't get up.

1513
01:42:52,464 --> 01:42:54,801
I thought you'd never get here.

1514
01:42:56,176 --> 01:42:57,302
Sit down.

1515
01:42:57,845 --> 01:43:02,182
This is Arturo, an expert.
He's in charge of the excavation.

1516
01:43:02,850 --> 01:43:04,601
We'll take samples of your saliva.

1517
01:43:04,685 --> 01:43:05,728
With a jab?

1518
01:43:05,812 --> 01:43:07,646
No, with a cotton swab.

1519
01:43:07,730 --> 01:43:12,359
If you have to jab me, jab away.
I'm like a pin cushion!

1520
01:43:12,567 --> 01:43:15,112
She isn't well. I told you already.

1521
01:43:15,195 --> 01:43:16,823
Open your mouth.

1522
01:43:17,698 --> 01:43:19,491
Very good.

1523
01:43:21,786 --> 01:43:24,079
That's it.

1524
01:43:24,496 --> 01:43:26,415
I'm very ill.

1525
01:43:27,374 --> 01:43:29,584
I hope for just one thing.

1526
01:43:29,668 --> 01:43:33,380
That they find my father
and I can bury him with my mother.

1527
01:43:33,463 --> 01:43:36,466
And she wants us
to bury her there too.

1528
01:43:36,550 --> 01:43:37,802
I won't last long.

1529
01:43:38,010 --> 01:43:39,261
Grandma, don't say that.

1530
01:43:40,012 --> 01:43:42,681
The cancer is consuming me,

1531
01:43:42,765 --> 01:43:45,810
but my dream is
to reunite the whole family.

1532
01:43:46,602 --> 01:43:51,690
In life we couldn't be together,
at least at the end we will be.

1533
01:43:51,774 --> 01:43:54,109
Tell me about your father.

1534
01:43:55,277 --> 01:43:57,946
I was four months old
when they killed him.

1535
01:43:58,030 --> 01:43:59,656
And she has memories of him.

1536
01:44:00,825 --> 01:44:03,160
I remember what my mother told me.

1537
01:44:03,243 --> 01:44:05,287
And what did your mother tell you?

1538
01:44:05,370 --> 01:44:06,914
Lots of things.

1539
01:44:07,122 --> 01:44:09,207
When they came for him,

1540
01:44:09,291 --> 01:44:11,878
my father had me in his arms.

1541
01:44:12,085 --> 01:44:14,254
He was playing with me.

1542
01:44:14,463 --> 01:44:16,214
My mother used to tell me,

1543
01:44:16,298 --> 01:44:19,635
and it's as if I remember it
from thinking about it so much,

1544
01:44:19,719 --> 01:44:23,472
that the last thing my father did
was play with me.

1545
01:44:25,808 --> 01:44:28,685
I had a rattle.

1546
01:44:28,770 --> 01:44:31,521
We never saw it again after that.

1547
01:44:32,147 --> 01:44:36,109
My mother looked for it all over the house
but she never found it.

1548
01:44:37,653 --> 01:44:39,529
I guess he took it.

1549
01:44:43,241 --> 01:44:44,242
Hello, Herminia!

1550
01:44:44,326 --> 01:44:46,119
How are you?

1551
01:44:46,203 --> 01:44:47,371
Fine.

1552
01:44:49,373 --> 01:44:52,459
This is Arturo,
he'll direct the exhumation in July.

1553
01:44:52,542 --> 01:44:54,837
Thank you so much,
we can't believe it.

1554
01:44:54,921 --> 01:44:56,088
Janis will have told you.

1555
01:44:56,171 --> 01:44:57,005
Yes, she did.

1556
01:44:57,089 --> 01:44:58,131
Come in.

1557
01:44:58,215 --> 01:44:59,549
Thank you.

1558
01:44:59,633 --> 01:45:01,218
The patio is beautiful!

1559
01:45:01,301 --> 01:45:02,469
Sit down.

1560
01:45:03,721 --> 01:45:05,514
Those wafers!

1561
01:45:05,597 --> 01:45:07,809
I haven't seen them in ages!

1562
01:45:08,141 --> 01:45:09,894
They're for you.

1563
01:45:13,272 --> 01:45:15,649
Is there any detail you remember
about your grandfather?

1564
01:45:15,733 --> 01:45:18,568
A lot, but we didn't know him.

1565
01:45:18,652 --> 01:45:22,740
Grandmother told us about him,
when she decided to talk.

1566
01:45:22,824 --> 01:45:26,703
Until just before she died
she never opened her mouth.

1567
01:45:26,786 --> 01:45:28,370
She was afraid.

1568
01:45:28,453 --> 01:45:30,122
We were all so afraid.

1569
01:45:31,749 --> 01:45:36,295
Grandfather was tall and handsome,
with beautiful eyes.

1570
01:45:36,378 --> 01:45:37,922
Just one.

1571
01:45:38,005 --> 01:45:39,716
The other was made of glass.

1572
01:45:39,799 --> 01:45:41,633
You don't see it in the photos.

1573
01:45:44,177 --> 01:45:45,888
My great-grandfather took that photo.

1574
01:45:46,723 --> 01:45:50,768
Did your grandmother say
if he carried anything regularly?

1575
01:45:50,852 --> 01:45:53,896
A watch, a pen,
a pipe, a piece of jewelry?

1576
01:45:54,688 --> 01:45:57,608
My mother told me that he never
took off his wedding ring,

1577
01:45:57,691 --> 01:45:58,942
not even in the fields.

1578
01:45:59,026 --> 01:46:01,320
-His wedding ring.
-Yes, never.

1579
01:46:01,403 --> 01:46:04,698
And inscribed on the inside
was the date of their wedding

1580
01:46:04,782 --> 01:46:07,576
and my grandmother's name, Josefa.

1581
01:46:08,201 --> 01:46:10,788
He was wearing clogs
when they took him.

1582
01:46:10,872 --> 01:46:13,415
They didn't give him time
to change his shoes.

1583
01:46:53,956 --> 01:46:56,208
My grandmother inherited
this house from her mother

1584
01:46:56,291 --> 01:46:58,001
and I inherited it from her.

1585
01:47:00,420 --> 01:47:02,547
I spent my childhood here.

1586
01:47:04,508 --> 01:47:06,927
My grandmother
was born in this room,

1587
01:47:07,762 --> 01:47:09,388
and my mother.

1588
01:49:12,720 --> 01:49:13,888
There's something here.

1589
01:49:19,059 --> 01:49:20,227
It's a casing.

1590
01:49:34,366 --> 01:49:35,659
-How was the drive?
-Great.

1591
01:49:38,120 --> 01:49:39,579
Look who's here!

1592
01:49:40,205 --> 01:49:41,791
Hello, Elena.

1593
01:49:42,541 --> 01:49:45,585
Hello, Cecilia. How are you?

1594
01:49:46,378 --> 01:49:47,254
How are you?

1595
01:49:47,462 --> 01:49:48,463
How about a kiss?

1596
01:49:48,547 --> 01:49:49,924
She's a bit cranky.

1597
01:49:50,007 --> 01:49:51,508
She doesn't like the car.

1598
01:49:52,301 --> 01:49:53,468
How are you getting on?

1599
01:49:53,552 --> 01:49:54,469
Fine.

1600
01:50:06,273 --> 01:50:08,942
So many years
waiting for this moment.

1601
01:50:10,485 --> 01:50:13,071
You don't know
how important it is for us.

1602
01:50:13,280 --> 01:50:15,949
I can imagine,
for us too.

1603
01:50:18,535 --> 01:50:19,912
Do you need anything?

1604
01:50:19,995 --> 01:50:21,955
No, we'll eat in the town.

1605
01:50:22,039 --> 01:50:23,708
Well, coffee and water, if you can.

1606
01:50:23,791 --> 01:50:25,584
I'll bring that now.

1607
01:50:25,667 --> 01:50:28,503
You can go and get settled in,
this'll take a while.

1608
01:50:28,587 --> 01:50:29,671
About how long?

1609
01:50:29,756 --> 01:50:33,885
It depends on the depth,
but three or four days.

1610
01:50:33,967 --> 01:50:35,427
But come whenever you want,

1611
01:50:35,510 --> 01:50:36,678
and the townspeople too.

1612
01:50:36,763 --> 01:50:38,472
Yes, they all want to come.

1613
01:50:38,555 --> 01:50:40,307
Let's go home.

1614
01:50:40,390 --> 01:50:41,893
-Are you all right?
-Yes.

1615
01:50:41,975 --> 01:50:43,602
See you later.

1616
01:50:45,437 --> 01:50:47,022
I'll bring the drinks now.

1617
01:51:07,125 --> 01:51:10,170
I'll drop by my house
and then bring them water and coffee.

1618
01:51:10,379 --> 01:51:12,089
We could go in the afternoon.

1619
01:51:12,297 --> 01:51:14,132
Let me know when you want to go.

1620
01:51:14,341 --> 01:51:15,592
Are you all right?

1621
01:51:15,676 --> 01:51:17,762
I really want to cry.

1622
01:51:18,637 --> 01:51:19,972
Let me know later.

1623
01:51:36,613 --> 01:51:37,824
It's so rural!

1624
01:51:37,907 --> 01:51:39,074
Yes, very rural.

1625
01:51:39,784 --> 01:51:42,160
I didn't want to modernize it.

1626
01:51:42,536 --> 01:51:43,996
No, I love it.

1627
01:51:44,079 --> 01:51:45,956
Do you like it, Cecilia?

1628
01:51:46,039 --> 01:51:47,624
Do you?

1629
01:51:47,709 --> 01:51:49,752
I'll show you around later.

1630
01:51:49,836 --> 01:51:51,796
All right.

1631
01:51:52,546 --> 01:51:54,965
You're going to have
a little brother or sister, Cecilia.

1632
01:51:56,926 --> 01:51:59,136
Do you know which it is?

1633
01:51:59,219 --> 01:52:02,765
No, it's too soon,
I'm only three months.

1634
01:52:02,849 --> 01:52:04,224
Have you thought of any name?

1635
01:52:04,433 --> 01:52:06,602
If it's a girl, Ana.

1636
01:52:07,729 --> 01:52:08,730
I like it.

1637
01:52:10,063 --> 01:52:13,066
If it's a boy, Antonio,
like my great-grandfather.

1638
01:52:13,609 --> 01:52:15,485
Do you like it?

1639
01:52:19,824 --> 01:52:22,993
My great-grandfather
was having dinner right here

1640
01:52:23,076 --> 01:52:27,372
with my great-grandmother
and my grandmother,

1641
01:52:27,956 --> 01:52:31,209
when the fascists came in
and took him.

1642
01:52:31,418 --> 01:52:33,211
They didn't even let him finish eating.

1643
01:52:34,254 --> 01:52:39,551
When he came back at dawn
he was pale and covered in mud.

1644
01:52:42,012 --> 01:52:45,767
He'd spent the whole night
digging his own grave.

1645
01:52:46,600 --> 01:52:50,062
The next night
they came for him again

1646
01:52:50,437 --> 01:52:52,064
but that time he didn't come back.

1647
01:52:52,606 --> 01:52:56,026
Why didn't he run off
after the first night?

1648
01:52:56,109 --> 01:53:00,238
I guess he didn't want to be separated
from his wife and daughter.

1649
01:53:03,283 --> 01:53:06,161
And out of pride and dignity.

1650
01:53:06,536 --> 01:53:07,747
I don't know.

1651
01:53:29,518 --> 01:53:32,229
If the femur goes in that direction,

1652
01:53:32,312 --> 01:53:34,356
the pelvis should be there.

1653
01:53:34,564 --> 01:53:38,652
Be careful with the pick,
the skull should be in that area.

1654
01:53:38,736 --> 01:53:40,905
So we'll continue?

1655
01:53:54,334 --> 01:53:55,669
A phalanx.

1656
01:54:05,596 --> 01:54:06,723
And a button.

1657
01:54:12,352 --> 01:54:14,479
They tied their hands with barbed wire.

1658
01:54:22,154 --> 01:54:23,530
The rattle.

1659
01:54:27,200 --> 01:54:29,536
I'm going to put a marker here.

1660
01:54:30,788 --> 01:54:32,331
Then we'll take a photo of that.

1661
01:55:37,604 --> 01:55:39,774
Good afternoon.

1662
01:55:39,857 --> 01:55:42,902
This is your moment,
we'll withdraw.

1663
01:57:04,566 --> 01:57:05,735
NO HISTORY IS MUTE.

1664
01:57:05,818 --> 01:57:07,820
NO MATTER HOW MUCH THEY BURN IT,

1665
01:57:07,904 --> 01:57:09,988
NO MATTER HOW MUCH THEY BREAK IT,

1666
01:57:10,072 --> 01:57:12,366
NO MATTER HOW MUCH THEY LIE ABOUT IT,

1667
01:57:12,449 --> 01:57:14,744
HUMAN HISTORY REFUSES
TO SHUT ITS MOUTH.

1668
01:57:14,827 --> 01:57:15,994
