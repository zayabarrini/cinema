You get back to work.
I'll see to it.

26
00:02:07,889 --> 00:02:08,855
Centro!

27
00:02:08,923 --> 00:02:11,753
Isabel, don't shout.
You'll wake up the neighborhood.

28
00:02:11,823 --> 00:02:13,948
I feel awful!

29
00:02:14,023 --> 00:02:15,510

- What?
- Nothing.

33
00:02:21,154 --> 00:02:23,552
You weren't exaggerating.
Far from it.

34
00:02:23,621 --> 00:02:27,849
Get up, love. You're in labor.
We have to get you dressed.

35
00:02:27,921 --> 00:02:29,854
Isabelita, you really fooled me.

36
00:02:29,922 --> 00:02:34,047
When you came to this house,
you weren't exactly alone.

37
00:02:34,121 --> 00:02:36,485
Be careful.

38
00:02:36,555 --> 00:02:37,919
Come on. That's it.

39
00:02:37,989 --> 00:02:40,852
Wait! I have to close the door!

40
00:02:40,921 --> 00:02:42,148
Take it slowly.

41
00:02:44,287 --> 00:02:47,254
Going into labor tonight!
You might have warned me.

42
00:02:47,321 --> 00:02:49,877
- How was I to know, Centro?
- Well, if you didn't-

43
00:02:49,953 --> 00:02:51,112
But I can't count.

44
00:02:51,187 --> 00:02:53,119
Ignorance- What a terrible thing!

45
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,946
Stop! Stop!

46
00:03:01,021 --> 00:03:02,383
Bastard!

47
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,549
Come on. Lean here.

48
00:03:07,619 --> 00:03:10,346
Careful.

49
00:03:23,619 --> 00:03:24,777
Stop!

50
00:03:29,052 --> 00:03:30,711
Centro, for God's sake!

51
00:03:30,785 --> 00:03:31,773
Stop!

52
00:03:31,852 --> 00:03:33,841
Stop, damn it!

53
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:35,385
Fucking hell!

54
00:03:39,418 --> 00:03:41,112
Now, don't worry.

55
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:44,310
Come on, love. Hurry, hurry.

56
00:03:51,451 --> 00:03:53,417
Are you crazy or what?

57
00:03:53,484 --> 00:03:55,143
I could have killed you!

58
00:03:55,217 --> 00:03:57,150
These high heels will kill me.

59
00:03:57,217 --> 00:04:00,513
You can't get on.
I'm going back to the depot.

60
00:04:00,584 --> 00:04:02,345
My friend's in labor.

61
00:04:02,417 --> 00:04:05,008
What do you want me to do?

62
00:04:05,084 --> 00:04:07,107
I told you not to get on.

63
00:04:07,184 --> 00:04:09,047
Sit down there, love.

64
00:04:09,117 --> 00:04:11,275
Don't do this. Please get off.

65
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:13,407
You don't have to adopt the baby!

66
00:04:13,483 --> 00:04:15,279
Just get us to a hospital!

67
00:04:15,351 --> 00:04:18,111
But I'm off duty.
Don't you understand?

68
00:04:18,183 --> 00:04:20,274
Ma'am, it isn't my bus.

69
00:04:22,283 --> 00:04:24,874
Take it easy! Hang on!
Close your legs!

70
00:04:24,949 --> 00:04:26,313
Breathe!

71
00:04:30,949 --> 00:04:36,075
Fuck! 30,000 drivers in Madrid
and it happens to me.

72
00:04:38,481 --> 00:04:40,573
Now, don't cry!

73
00:04:42,182 --> 00:04:45,807
If idiots like us didn't decide
to give birth occasionally...

74
00:04:45,881 --> 00:04:49,177
the world would be empty
or full of old people.

75
00:04:49,248 --> 00:04:51,839
See, the cologne cools you down.

76
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:10,206
- It's falling.
- Press your legs together.

77
00:05:10,281 --> 00:05:12,679
I mean the angel.

78
00:05:12,746 --> 00:05:15,679
It looks like it's going to jump.

79
00:05:15,747 --> 00:05:18,906
As if the poor thing
wanted to kill itself.

80
00:05:31,713 --> 00:05:33,804
I've wet myself.

81
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:37,367
No, it isn't that, love.
You've broken your waters.

82
00:05:37,446 --> 00:05:38,537
Stop, please!

83
00:05:38,612 --> 00:05:40,373
My friend's broken her waters!

84
00:05:40,446 --> 00:05:44,071
I'll park where
we won't be in the way!

85
00:05:44,145 --> 00:05:46,338
Put your legs up here.

86
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:49,502
That's it. Now the other one.

87
00:05:49,578 --> 00:05:52,067
Take it easy. Come on.

88
00:05:52,145 --> 00:05:53,804
Don't worry. I'm with you.

89
00:05:53,878 --> 00:05:56,571
Let's go for it.
Come on. That's it.

90
00:05:56,645 --> 00:05:59,543
Push, push, push!

91
00:05:59,611 --> 00:06:01,804
Keep going!

92
00:06:01,878 --> 00:06:04,604
That's good!

93
00:06:04,677 --> 00:06:08,837
Very good! Keep going!

94
00:06:08,911 --> 00:06:10,570
Good!

95
00:06:10,644 --> 00:06:12,542
Push, push, push!

96
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:14,735
Driver! Come and help me!

97
00:06:14,811 --> 00:06:17,174
Push!

98
00:06:17,243 --> 00:06:19,709
Keep going!

99
00:06:21,509 --> 00:06:23,169
That's it! There it is!

100
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:31,106
It's a boy!

101
00:06:31,177 --> 00:06:34,267
And he's real rowdy, eh?

102
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:37,869
Just what we need!

103
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:41,865
First of all,
we have to tie the cord.

104
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:44,965
Have you got anything
to tie the umbilical cord?

105
00:06:45,042 --> 00:06:48,099
I know. Your shoelaces.
Give them to me.

106
00:06:48,176 --> 00:06:50,334
You did really well.

107
00:06:50,408 --> 00:06:52,340
Does he have everything?

108
00:06:52,408 --> 00:06:53,772
Everything?

109
00:06:53,842 --> 00:06:55,741
The kid's got it all.

110
00:06:55,808 --> 00:06:57,832
Your other shoelace.

111
00:07:00,343 --> 00:07:03,796
And now we have to cut the cord.

112
00:07:03,874 --> 00:07:06,773
Have you got scissors?
Anything to cut with?

113
00:07:06,842 --> 00:07:09,103
God, you've got nothing!

114
00:07:09,175 --> 00:07:10,800
I know.

115
00:07:10,874 --> 00:07:13,305
I'll cut it with my teeth.

116
00:07:13,374 --> 00:07:15,363
This doesn't hurt.

117
00:07:15,441 --> 00:07:18,873
Give me a cloth for the baby.

118
00:07:20,574 --> 00:07:22,802
- Poor little thing.
- Here, take this.

119
00:07:22,874 --> 00:07:24,395
My baby!

120
00:07:33,507 --> 00:07:36,267
There he is now!
There's your baby!

121
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:38,806
My baby! Aren't you beautiful!

122
00:07:40,174 --> 00:07:42,571
Aren't you beautiful.

123
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,162
- Now where do we go?
- To the hospital.

124
00:07:45,239 --> 00:07:48,830
She's in no shape
to come home with me.

125
00:07:48,906 --> 00:07:51,168
Hold him tight.
You're very weak.

126
00:07:51,239 --> 00:07:52,830
Don't drop him.

127
00:07:58,206 --> 00:08:00,535
You mustn't fall asleep.

128
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:04,833
Careful, we're moving.

129
00:08:06,739 --> 00:08:09,035
You can't go to sleep.

130
00:08:09,105 --> 00:08:11,866
Look at how beautiful he is.

131
00:08:12,771 --> 00:08:14,896
The pains have started again.

132
00:08:16,304 --> 00:08:20,169
That's the placenta.
Give me the baby.

133
00:08:20,238 --> 00:08:22,703
You have to push again.

134
00:08:22,771 --> 00:08:24,293
- Again?
- Again.

135
00:08:24,371 --> 00:08:28,064
You have to get it all out.
Come on, love. Push.

136
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:33,335
Hurry up! This woman's bleeding!

137
00:08:33,403 --> 00:08:35,233
We're on our way!

138
00:08:45,537 --> 00:08:47,594
Rest for a while.

139
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:53,398
You couldn't wait, could you?

140
00:08:55,036 --> 00:08:59,162
You were in a big hurry to get
to Madrid, and here you are.

141
00:08:59,236 --> 00:09:00,895
What are you going to call him?

142
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:02,435
Victor.

143
00:09:08,402 --> 00:09:11,493
Look, Victor.
Madrid.

167
00:10:37,498 --> 00:10:43,623
<i>A deer among the green rockrose
he was following</i>

168
00:10:43,698 --> 00:10:47,494
<i>Throughout all of Andalusia</i>

169
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:51,620
<i>You'll never find
another dog like my dog</i>

170
00:10:51,697 --> 00:10:55,425
Dogs! That's how they treat us
and that's what we are.

171
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:58,486
Dogs.

172
00:10:58,563 --> 00:11:01,359
Look at the lambs
we have to protect.

173
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:04,658
<i>He was so happy when he returned</i>

174
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,855
<i>He took such care</i>

175
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:11,328
<i>Bringing my flock back to me</i>

176
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:24,154
<i>He was the key to my farm
and the guardian of my flocks</i>

177
00:11:24,229 --> 00:11:27,319
<i>There wasn't a wolf
that would come near</i>

178
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:31,827
<i>The lambs on the river bank</i>

179
00:11:31,895 --> 00:11:36,259
<i>He was the bravest of the brave</i>

180
00:11:37,928 --> 00:11:39,554
Look at them.

181
00:11:39,629 --> 00:11:41,788
Stealing, scheming...

182
00:11:41,862 --> 00:11:44,691
betraying and corrupting
each other.

183
00:11:48,094 --> 00:11:53,392
<i>There'll never be
another dog like my dog</i>

184
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,952
We're the guardians
of a sick flock.

185
00:12:03,827 --> 00:12:06,622
Here, have a drink
to celebrate it.

186
00:12:06,694 --> 00:12:09,252
No, thanks. You drink enough
for both of us.

187
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:33,157
Hi, it's me.

188
00:12:35,492 --> 00:12:37,617
- What are you doing?
- Watering plants.

189
00:12:37,693 --> 00:12:39,216
Are you angry?

190
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:41,814
Not angry, bruised.

191
00:12:41,892 --> 00:12:42,858
Forgive me.

192
00:12:43,825 --> 00:12:47,985
I'm sorry I left like I did.
Do you forgive me?

193
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:50,990
Sancho, I don't like
discussing this on the phone.

194
00:12:51,058 --> 00:12:53,752
Well, we'll talk later, all right?

195
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:58,256
I'll be home as soon as I can.

196
00:12:58,325 --> 00:13:00,791
So long, my darling.

197
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:13,682
My wife's cheating on me.

198
00:13:13,756 --> 00:13:14,949
What?

199
00:13:15,023 --> 00:13:17,012
Clara's sleeping with someone.

200
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:19,487
Come on, Sancho.
Don't talk rubbish.

201
00:13:19,556 --> 00:13:22,954
- I don't know what to do.
- Try drinking less.

202
00:13:23,023 --> 00:13:25,648
Non-drinkers think not drinking
solves everything.

203
00:13:25,723 --> 00:13:28,621
I really don't think
alcohol helps you at all.

204
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:30,680
If I don't drink, I'll kill her.

205
00:13:30,755 --> 00:13:32,847
Quit talking shit!

206
00:13:34,222 --> 00:13:36,983
It's the only way
a woman won't cheat.

207
00:13:38,723 --> 00:13:41,484
Of course, I could kill him.

208
00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:45,521
But I don't know who he is.

209
00:13:47,556 --> 00:13:49,487
Could it be one of them?

210
00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:54,414
To think that any of those creeps
could go screw my wife...

211
00:13:54,488 --> 00:13:55,920
while I'm working.

212
00:13:55,988 --> 00:13:57,955
Just the thought makes me sick.

213
00:14:33,819 --> 00:14:34,808
Beautiful!

214
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:42,247
No, my father isn't here.
You can come over.

215
00:14:45,752 --> 00:14:47,513
Learn to wait?

216
00:14:47,585 --> 00:14:50,575
I don't give a fuck
what Lou Reed says!

217
00:14:50,653 --> 00:14:52,618
If you aren't here
in 15 minutes...

218
00:14:52,686 --> 00:14:54,084
I'll call the Pirate.

219
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:59,852
Yeah, she sells shit,
but at least it's something.

220
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:02,440
Bring me some candy bars too.

221
00:15:02,518 --> 00:15:04,451
It'll save me going down.

- Yes? Who is it?

224
00:15:18,252 --> 00:15:20,046
- It's Victor.
- Victor who?

225
00:15:20,117 --> 00:15:22,413
The guy from last Saturday.

226
00:15:22,984 --> 00:15:24,814
What guy?

227
00:15:24,885 --> 00:15:27,577
The one you screwed
in the toilets, remember?

228
00:15:28,817 --> 00:15:30,408
I was very high.

229
00:15:30,484 --> 00:15:32,779
We arranged to meet tonight.

230
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:34,748
I'm about to go out.

231
00:15:34,817 --> 00:15:35,646
Where?

232
00:15:35,717 --> 00:15:37,683
With a friend.
Call another day.

233
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:41,944
A friend?
But you arranged to meet me!

234
00:15:42,017 --> 00:15:43,914
I told you, I forgot!

235
00:15:43,983 --> 00:15:48,142
But I've brought you a pizza.
You said you'd liked them.

236
00:15:48,215 --> 00:15:50,375
- This guy's dumb!
- It's still warm.

237
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:52,143
Then you eat it!

238
00:15:52,216 --> 00:15:54,647
I've changed my mind.
Don't call me again.

Hey.
Next stop's Eduarto Dato.

241
00:16:52,313 --> 00:16:54,745
We've done a full circuit
of Madrid.

242
00:16:54,813 --> 00:16:56,336
I know.

243
00:16:57,646 --> 00:16:59,010
Aren't you getting out?

244
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,273
- No, I'm going on.
- Where to?

245
00:17:01,347 --> 00:17:02,902
I don't know. Nowhere.

246
00:17:02,979 --> 00:17:06,571
Nowhere? This isn't a hotel.
You must be going somewhere.

247
00:17:06,646 --> 00:17:08,702
I'm not. So what?

248
00:17:10,146 --> 00:17:11,907
Going to stay here all night?

249
00:17:11,979 --> 00:17:13,843
- I'll get off.
- When?

250
00:17:13,913 --> 00:17:15,138
Later.

251
00:17:15,211 --> 00:17:18,735
It better be soon. And watch it.

Fucker!

253
00:18:23,642 --> 00:18:26,233
She had to go out, huh? Liar!

254
00:18:26,309 --> 00:18:28,299
How long ago did he leave?

255
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:31,968
Tell me the truth,
or I'll go somewhere else.

256

But don't touch anything.

260
00:19:27,472 --> 00:19:29,063
What are you doing here?

261
00:19:29,139 --> 00:19:31,536
- You let me in.
- Me?

262
00:19:31,605 --> 00:19:34,299
I thought you were
somebody else.

263
00:19:34,372 --> 00:19:35,633
Well, it's me.

264
00:19:35,706 --> 00:19:38,330
We made a date a week ago.

265
00:19:38,405 --> 00:19:41,531
Who do you think you are, anyway?

266
00:19:41,606 --> 00:19:44,867
- You were expecting a dealer?
- What is it to you, asshole?

267
00:19:44,939 --> 00:19:47,371
- Get out!
- Watch it.

268
00:19:47,438 --> 00:19:49,869
I wasn't rude to you.

269
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:52,496
I'll go when I get
an explanation.

270
00:20:00,037 --> 00:20:03,004
Fuck, don't take it that way.

271
00:20:03,071 --> 00:20:05,797
I just wanted to talk
for a while.

272
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:10,632
I met you a week ago.

273
00:20:10,704 --> 00:20:12,760
We had a really great fuck.

274
00:20:15,437 --> 00:20:17,902
It was my first time.

275
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:19,765
You know what that is?

276
00:20:19,836 --> 00:20:22,926
And it's the first time
I've stolen from a pizzeria.

277
00:20:23,002 --> 00:20:25,468
I did it to be with you.

278
00:20:30,303 --> 00:20:31,826
Get out.

279
00:20:33,202 --> 00:20:36,134
Can't you see
I'm pointing a gun at you?

280
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:39,865
Get out of here!

281
00:20:39,937 --> 00:20:43,425
Just because you came between
my legs the other night...

282
00:20:43,502 --> 00:20:46,832
you think you can sneak in here
demanding explanations?

283
00:20:46,902 --> 00:20:48,731
What is this, you shit?

284
00:20:48,802 --> 00:20:50,200
Don't insult me!

285
00:20:50,269 --> 00:20:53,893
A great fuck? Jerk-off,
you didn't even stick it in!

286
00:20:53,968 --> 00:20:55,935
You've got a lot to learn!

287
00:20:56,002 --> 00:20:57,296
Shut up!

it was I who killed the woman.</i>

I wasn't going to leave you
here unconscious.

Who do you take me for?

305

It really hurts.

306
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:56,919
You cut my head.

307

Get out, or I'll call the cops.

Someone called downstairs.
I said you weren't in.

He was pissed off.
He had some candy bars for you.

00:24:12,458 --> 00:24:13,856
Lay off!

326
00:24:13,926 --> 00:24:16,256
I'll go first. You cover me.

327
00:24:16,326 --> 00:24:20,018
But, Sancho, we need backup.
This is a rat hole!

328
00:24:20,091 --> 00:24:23,454
You want to wait till that girl
is raped and killed?

329
00:24:25,724 --> 00:24:28,657
Of course I don't,
but this isn't the way.

330
00:24:28,725 --> 00:24:31,020
Scared shitless isn't either.

331
00:24:31,091 --> 00:24:34,580
I'm scared because I haven't drunk
two bottles of whiskey...

332
00:24:34,659 --> 00:24:36,453
and no one's screwing my wife!

333
00:24:36,524 --> 00:24:39,082
What was that?
Never mention Clara again!

334
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:42,486
Cool it, Sancho! Shit!

335
00:24:44,224 --> 00:24:46,212
There's the door.

336
00:24:46,757 --> 00:24:50,053
Now what do we do?
How do we get in?

337
00:24:50,124 --> 00:24:52,146
Give me the radio.
We'll call a squad car.

338
00:24:52,223 --> 00:24:54,985
- We have to get in.
- How do we do that?

339
00:24:55,057 --> 00:24:56,353
We knock.

340
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:05,618
Don't take the gun.
It's my father's.

341
00:25:05,689 --> 00:25:07,849
There's your fucking gun.

342
00:25:13,756 --> 00:25:15,381
Police! Open up!

343
00:25:17,722 --> 00:25:19,245
Open up!

344
00:25:25,089 --> 00:25:26,781
Don't move, or I'll shoot!

345
00:25:26,855 --> 00:25:28,946
Take it easy! Let the girl go!

346
00:25:29,022 --> 00:25:32,010
Why are you here?
I haven't done anything!

347
00:25:32,087 --> 00:25:34,213
Tell them it's a mistake.

348
00:25:34,289 --> 00:25:36,880
- It's your mistake, asshole.
- Sancho!

349
00:25:36,955 --> 00:25:38,352
I haven't done anything!

350
00:25:38,421 --> 00:25:40,250
And that cut on her face?

351
00:25:40,321 --> 00:25:41,582
What cut?

352
00:25:41,655 --> 00:25:44,382
I'm sorry. Did I hurt you?
It must have happened now!

353
00:25:44,454 --> 00:25:46,750
Let her go,
or I'll rip your balls off!

354
00:25:46,821 --> 00:25:48,650
Sancho, don't provoke him!

355
00:25:48,721 --> 00:25:50,652
Don't you provoke me!

356
00:25:52,454 --> 00:25:53,613
What's your name?

357
00:25:53,688 --> 00:25:56,244
Victor. Victor Plaza.

358
00:25:58,587 --> 00:26:01,747
I know there's
an explanation for all this.

359
00:26:01,819 --> 00:26:04,217
Put down the gun.

360
00:26:04,287 --> 00:26:07,878
Let me have the girl,
then you can explain it all.

361
00:26:07,953 --> 00:26:09,885
Deal?

362
00:26:09,953 --> 00:26:12,680
All right, but tell him
to stop aiming at my balls.

363
00:26:12,753 --> 00:26:15,742
Let her go, or I'll bounce them
off the wall!

364
00:26:15,819 --> 00:26:17,909
Stop! Give me your gun!

365
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:21,052
What are you doing?

366
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,211
You've flipped.

367
00:26:23,818 --> 00:26:25,580
You're aiming at a superior!

368
00:26:25,653 --> 00:26:28,585
I am aiming at a lunatic
and a drunk.

369
00:26:28,653 --> 00:26:30,118
Give me your gun.

370
00:26:31,052 --> 00:26:32,745
Victor, here's the deal.

371
00:26:32,818 --> 00:26:34,682
My partner will give me his gun.

372
00:26:34,753 --> 00:26:37,582
Then you put down yours.

373
00:26:37,652 --> 00:26:39,482
Let me have- What's your name?

374
00:26:41,551 --> 00:26:44,449
Elena, pleased to meet you.
All right?

375
00:26:46,152 --> 00:26:48,174
- Yeah. Well-
- All right.

376
00:26:48,251 --> 00:26:50,979
Sancho, give me
your fucking gun!

377
00:26:51,051 --> 00:26:52,311
Let me go!

378
00:26:52,384 --> 00:26:55,010
Victor, take it easy, all right?

379
00:26:55,084 --> 00:26:58,243
We made a deal.
Now it's your turn.

380
00:26:58,317 --> 00:26:59,943
Yeah, but what'll happen to me?

381
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:03,676
Nothing at all.
Put down the gun.

382
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:06,478
Put down the gun, please.
Slowly.

383
00:27:07,517 --> 00:27:09,607
That's the way. Miss-

384
00:27:11,683 --> 00:27:12,944
Put down the gun.

385
00:27:51,915 --> 00:27:53,313
Drop the gun!

386
00:27:55,414 --> 00:27:56,937
Sancho, drop the gun!

387
00:28:07,947 --> 00:28:10,209
Sancho, please! Fuck!

388
00:28:10,281 --> 00:28:12,906
What are you doing?
Get out of here!

389
00:28:21,914 --> 00:28:24,471
Go! Get out!

390
00:28:29,746 --> 00:28:32,042

395

<i>the way I suffer.</i>

404
00:29:29,577 --> 00:29:32,838

406
00:29:38,643 --> 00:29:40,666
<i>What I want</i>

407
00:29:40,743 --> 00:29:42,971
<i>Is for you to feel</i>

408
00:29:43,043 --> 00:29:44,440
<i>As useless</i>

409
00:29:47,976 --> 00:29:54,170
<i>As an empty whiskey glass
in one's hands</i>

410
00:29:57,209 --> 00:30:03,039
<i>And I want the heart
in your breast</i>

411

413

<i>Hello, Mother.</i>

439
00:34:31,395 --> 00:34:33,191
I got out two days ago.

440
00:34:34,762 --> 00:34:37,853
I've been cleaning
the house since then.

441
00:34:37,929 --> 00:34:39,588
It was a mess!

442
00:34:41,995 --> 00:34:44,052
I went to the bank today.

443
00:34:46,062 --> 00:34:49,584
For my inheritance.
150,000 pesetas.

444

On my way here,
I was trying to work out...

445
00:34:57,395 --> 00:35:00,155
how many tricks
you had to turn...

446
00:35:00,227 --> 00:35:03,523
to save 150,000 pesetas.

447

At the very least...

448
00:35:05,727 --> 00:35:08,216
a thousand tricks.

449
00:35:08,294 --> 00:35:11,418
I've got the same amount

450

It isn't fair.

451
00:35:14,994 --> 00:35:17,017
However you look at it,
it isn't fair!

452
00:35:42,726 --> 00:35:45,351
- I'm sorry, Elena.
- Thank you.

453

Ma'am, I'm a friend of David's.

Elena, I'm very sorry.
I'm very close to you.

I'm very sorry.

Ma'am...

458
00:36:17,591 --> 00:36:20,420
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

00:36:23,324 --> 00:36:24,255
I'm Ana.

I work with Elena

- No, that's enough.

- Chief?
- What is it?

465
00:36:47,521 --> 00:36:50,386
May I take some flowers
for my mother's grave?

466
00:36:50,456 --> 00:36:53,580
Take all you want.
Mr. Benedetti won't mind much.

467
00:36:53,655 --> 00:36:55,883
- Thanks a lot.
- You're welcome.

468
00:36:55,955 --> 00:36:58,478
We're just about finished.

469
00:36:58,556 --> 00:37:01,181

Is this the funeral
for Mr. Benedetti?

474
00:37:21,555 --> 00:37:25,112
This is the grave,
but his family left ages ago.

475
00:37:25,188 --> 00:37:28,517
I've been wandering
around here like a zombie.

476
00:37:28,587 --> 00:37:30,519
It was really dull and quick.

477
00:37:30,587 --> 00:37:33,213
They all went off
in a terrible hurry.

478
00:37:34,786 --> 00:37:36,082
I was disappointed.

479
00:37:36,153 --> 00:37:38,415
Are you a friend
of the family?

480
00:37:38,487 --> 00:37:40,418
Of Elena's, really. All I know...

481
00:37:40,486 --> 00:37:44,010
is that her father was
an Italian diplomat with a gun.

482
00:37:44,087 --> 00:37:47,484
- And you?
- Actually, I know David best.

483
00:37:48,353 --> 00:37:50,545
You think they're happy?

484
00:37:50,619 --> 00:37:52,210
The dead?

485
00:37:53,553 --> 00:37:55,041
Perhaps.

486
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:56,607
I wonder that too.

487
00:37:56,685 --> 00:38:00,140
No, I meant David and Elena.

488
00:38:00,219 --> 00:38:03,548
- I don't know! Ask them!
- This way.

489
00:38:08,252 --> 00:38:10,150
Do you know her?

490
00:38:10,218 --> 00:38:13,276
- Or rather, did you know her?
- Not very well.

491
00:38:13,351 --> 00:38:15,284
She was my mother.

492
00:38:17,485 --> 00:38:18,849
Thank you.

493
00:38:19,951 --> 00:38:22,815
I left my car at one
of the cemetery gates.

494
00:38:22,885 --> 00:38:24,850
If you help me find it,
I'll give you a lift.

495
00:38:24,917 --> 00:38:27,577
It's a deal.

496
00:38:27,651 --> 00:38:32,083
Honestly, I've got absolutely
no sense of direction.

497
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:34,639
I'd get lost
in my own back yard.

498
00:38:34,718 --> 00:38:37,376
Can you remember
the car model and color?

499
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:39,178
Come on! I'm not that loopy!

500
00:38:52,884 --> 00:38:55,372
My God, this looks
like Sarajevo!

501
00:38:56,149 --> 00:38:58,138
It's going to be expropriated.

502
00:38:58,216 --> 00:38:59,476
Really? When?

503
00:38:59,549 --> 00:39:02,243
I don't know. They're going
to build a big avenue.

504
00:39:02,316 --> 00:39:04,248
"The Prince of Asturias."

505
00:39:06,749 --> 00:39:08,442
Can I offer you a drink?

506
00:39:08,515 --> 00:39:11,709
To be honest, a drink
would help warm me up.

507
00:39:19,716 --> 00:39:22,146
I just moved.
The furniture's coming.

508
00:39:22,915 --> 00:39:26,745
- Maybe we should leave it-
- But I can buy you a drink.

509
00:39:26,815 --> 00:39:30,042
- Look, 150,000 pesetas.
- No, another day.

510
00:39:30,114 --> 00:39:32,104
Listen, I didn't steal it.

511
00:39:32,182 --> 00:39:33,976
This is an inheritance.

512
00:39:34,047 --> 00:39:35,979
An inheritance, get it?

513
00:39:36,047 --> 00:39:37,980
What's the matter?

514
00:39:41,314 --> 00:39:42,779
My name's Clara.

515
00:39:42,847 --> 00:39:44,780
And don't get angry.
We'll meet another day.

516
00:39:44,848 --> 00:39:46,676
All right. I'm sorry.

517
00:39:46,747 --> 00:39:48,770
My name's Victor.

518
00:39:48,847 --> 00:39:50,835
Bye, Victor. See you again.

519
00:39:51,813 --> 00:39:54,712
I'm very close to you.

520
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:24,807
What did you say?

521
00:40:26,612 --> 00:40:28,101
Cool, dude.

522
00:40:35,511 --> 00:40:37,170
Even cooler.

523
00:40:46,612 --> 00:40:48,042
Up you go.

524
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:15,407
I saw Victor Plaza
at the funeral.

525
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:19,667
Victor?

526
00:41:21,843 --> 00:41:24,035
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

527
00:41:24,109 --> 00:41:26,439
I didn't see him.

528
00:41:26,509 --> 00:41:29,668
You had your back to him.

529
00:41:29,742 --> 00:41:32,334
You were going
to the car with Sancho.

530
00:41:33,376 --> 00:41:35,705
Fucking son of a bitch!

531
00:41:35,775 --> 00:41:38,969
- Did he say anything?
- He sympathized with me.

532
00:41:39,042 --> 00:41:40,836
He's a psychopath.

533
00:41:42,709 --> 00:41:44,607
How did he know
about the funeral?

534
00:41:46,141 --> 00:41:47,504
I don't know.

535
00:41:50,008 --> 00:41:51,837
Maybe he followed you.

536
00:41:53,441 --> 00:41:55,737
We have to tell the police.

537
00:41:55,808 --> 00:41:58,365
No, David. Don't do anything.

538
00:41:58,441 --> 00:42:01,635
I'm not going to let that madman
follow you around.

539
00:42:02,974 --> 00:42:06,566
We can't report him
for expressing his sympathy.

540
00:42:29,973 --> 00:42:32,336
People think charity
is giving away...

541
00:42:32,405 --> 00:42:35,372
the worst things you have.

542
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,927
And it isn't that.

543
00:42:37,005 --> 00:42:39,995
Sure, we get lots
of worn out t-shirts...

544
00:42:40,073 --> 00:42:41,834
but what about anoraks?

545
00:42:43,172 --> 00:42:45,400
We'll have to hit Elena
for money again.

546
00:44:04,602 --> 00:44:07,227
You know this is illegal entry?

547
00:44:07,301 --> 00:44:09,062
I don't give a fuck.

548
00:44:15,334 --> 00:44:18,767
Why were you in the cemetery
the other day, spying on my wife?

549
00:44:18,834 --> 00:44:20,856
I wasn't spying on anyone.

550
00:44:20,933 --> 00:44:23,559
My mother died
while I was inside.

551
00:44:23,634 --> 00:44:26,429
I just happened to be near
your fucking funeral.

552
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:28,728
You always happen to be
where you shouldn't.

553
00:44:29,634 --> 00:44:32,326
That's true.
I'm not as lucky as you.

554
00:44:33,666 --> 00:44:36,224
You always win,
even in the worst moments.

555
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:39,197
If you go near my wife again...

556
00:44:40,766 --> 00:44:42,232
I'll crack your skull.

557
00:44:45,299 --> 00:44:46,663
How?

558
00:44:53,466 --> 00:44:55,328
What a goal!

559
00:44:55,398 --> 00:44:58,660
What a fucking goal!

560
00:44:58,732 --> 00:45:00,755
Look, look, look!

561
00:45:00,832 --> 00:45:03,060
Did you see that dribble?

562
00:45:07,065 --> 00:45:09,054
Caminero's a knockout!

563
00:45:09,131 --> 00:45:10,995
You're fucking great!

564
00:45:21,031 --> 00:45:23,622
Well, Victor.
I've warned you.

565
00:46:33,961 --> 00:46:36,052
Help me. I've brought you
something.

566
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:54,785
Great!

567
00:47:08,059 --> 00:47:11,026
We put it like this.
See how good it looks?

568
00:47:11,093 --> 00:47:12,751
- Now it's a sofa.
- Great!

569
00:47:12,825 --> 00:47:15,485
And it opens into a bed.

570
00:47:15,559 --> 00:47:17,251
Thanks a lot.

571
00:47:29,625 --> 00:47:31,955
- Here, read this.
- A Bible.

572
00:47:32,024 --> 00:47:34,319
Yes, it's my Bible.

573
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:36,516
- What's this?
- Read it.

574
00:47:41,891 --> 00:47:43,880
Go on, read it.

575
00:47:43,958 --> 00:47:46,185
"Tonsillectomy in childhood."

576
00:47:46,257 --> 00:47:49,019
- "No toxic addictions."
- Not one.

577
00:47:49,091 --> 00:47:53,352
- Hemoglobin. Hemato- What?
- Hematocrits.

578
00:47:53,424 --> 00:47:54,720
"Iron."

579
00:47:58,990 --> 00:48:01,286
"Anti-HIV, negative."

580
00:48:02,424 --> 00:48:05,117
So, I'm real healthy.

581
00:48:05,190 --> 00:48:06,917
Yes, you are.

582
00:48:06,990 --> 00:48:10,251
I didn't tell you before...

583
00:48:12,122 --> 00:48:14,644
I just got out of jail.

584
00:48:20,555 --> 00:48:22,487
- Hot, isn't it?
- Nice.

585
00:48:28,522 --> 00:48:31,011
What does that mean?
What is that?

586
00:48:31,089 --> 00:48:32,111
Bulgarian.

587
00:48:32,188 --> 00:48:34,984
It means if you want,
we can open the futon.

588
00:48:47,988 --> 00:48:49,783
Stop looking.

589
00:48:49,855 --> 00:48:53,015
I've never seen
anything like it.

590
00:48:53,088 --> 00:48:54,746
Me neither.

591
00:48:56,854 --> 00:48:58,343
Come here.

592
00:48:59,654 --> 00:49:00,641
Here I go.

593
00:49:07,486 --> 00:49:09,679
How was it?

594
00:49:09,753 --> 00:49:13,014
- I didn't even notice.
- I don't have much experience.

595
00:49:15,486 --> 00:49:18,008
- Why don't you teach me?
- You can't teach that.

596
00:49:18,086 --> 00:49:22,985
You can teach anything.
And I learn fast. Real fast.

597
00:49:23,054 --> 00:49:26,644
I want to become
the best lover in the world.

598
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:31,015
Tell me the things
you like to do...

599
00:49:31,086 --> 00:49:33,847
what you think about
when you masturbate.

600
00:49:33,919 --> 00:49:37,715
I've got time to learn.

601
00:49:39,919 --> 00:49:43,782
Look, Victor. You've treated me
like a hen's ass.

602
00:49:43,852 --> 00:49:46,079
Christ, what a put-down!

603
00:49:46,151 --> 00:49:49,209
First of all, don't dive
at my pussy so fast.

604
00:49:49,285 --> 00:49:50,875
I mustn't dive at it.

605
00:49:50,952 --> 00:49:52,883
Not to eat it...

606
00:49:53,952 --> 00:49:55,884
or stick it in.

607
00:49:57,252 --> 00:49:59,876
You have to prepare it first.

608
00:49:59,951 --> 00:50:04,111
And don't worry.
It'll tell you when it's ready.

609
00:50:04,184 --> 00:50:05,843
How will it tell me?

610
00:50:05,917 --> 00:50:09,110
- It'll tell you. It'll notice.
- I hope so.

611
00:50:12,750 --> 00:50:15,716
That's the first lesson.
Making love involves two people.

612
00:50:15,783 --> 00:50:17,613
Great! And the second?

613
00:52:00,946 --> 00:52:03,410
- Hi, Clemen. How are things?
- A mess.

614
00:52:03,477 --> 00:52:06,706
I had to send Josep home
before he gave us all the flu.

615
00:52:06,779 --> 00:52:09,835
- How are the kids?
- Fine. A volunteer showed up.

616
00:52:09,911 --> 00:52:13,071
- Does he have references?
- He knows a lot about boilers.

617
00:52:13,145 --> 00:52:15,110
- Has he fixed ours?
- He has.

618
00:52:15,177 --> 00:52:19,235
- Great, but who is he?
- Well, he studied education.

619
00:52:19,312 --> 00:52:21,038
He's promised to stay
the whole year.

620
00:52:21,110 --> 00:52:24,406
- I took a real shine to him.
- I can see that!

621
00:52:24,477 --> 00:52:27,238
When he saw
that I was so busy...

622
00:52:27,311 --> 00:52:30,209
he offered to help
with the kids.

623
00:52:30,277 --> 00:52:31,675
They're having a ball.
They're just crazy about him!

624
00:52:39,109 --> 00:52:41,473
Mr. Wolf! Come over here!

625
00:52:59,310 --> 00:53:02,469
Victor, this is Elena.
She's the big boss.

626
00:53:02,542 --> 00:53:05,337
Miguel, you're obsessed
with legs.

627
00:53:05,409 --> 00:53:07,806
- Let go!
- Pleased to meet you.

628
00:53:10,142 --> 00:53:12,869
- What are you doing, Victor?
- Me? I'm helping.

629
00:53:12,942 --> 00:53:15,533
By following me
like a psychopath?

630
00:53:15,608 --> 00:53:16,835
I'm not following you.

631
00:53:16,908 --> 00:53:20,305
Since you got out,
I see you everywhere.

632
00:53:20,374 --> 00:53:23,466
I'm sorry, but we live
in the same city.

633
00:53:24,608 --> 00:53:28,540
- I don't think you can stay.
- Why not?

634
00:53:28,608 --> 00:53:32,335
Clemen said that
my teaching diploma was acceptable.

635
00:53:32,408 --> 00:53:35,339
Your diploma!
When did you study teaching?

636
00:53:35,407 --> 00:53:38,396
In jail, by correspondence.

637
00:53:38,473 --> 00:53:41,030
Did you tell Clemen
that you were in jail?

638
00:53:41,106 --> 00:53:42,572
What's up?

639
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:46,198
I can't stay because I've been
in jail? It was your fault.

640
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:51,802
What is this?
An NGO or a ministry?

641
00:53:51,874 --> 00:53:55,771
This is a shelter for 12 children
who have suffered enough.

642
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:58,931
I don't want our problems
to affect them.

643
00:54:01,906 --> 00:54:04,201
"You will be damned
in the town...

644
00:54:04,272 --> 00:54:06,670
and in the country.

645
00:54:06,739 --> 00:54:09,465
Damned will be
the fruit of your body...

646
00:54:09,538 --> 00:54:11,061
the produce of your soul.

647
00:54:11,139 --> 00:54:14,105
You will be damned
coming in and going out."

648
00:54:16,905 --> 00:54:18,598
Deuteronomy.

649
00:54:18,672 --> 00:54:21,297
<i>Chapter 28.</i>

650
00:54:21,371 --> 00:54:24,667
Moses was thinking of me
when he wrote it.

651
00:54:26,439 --> 00:54:28,097
Lesson number 11.

652
00:54:28,171 --> 00:54:29,728
What's it to be today?

653
00:54:30,972 --> 00:54:33,766
Whatever you want.

654
00:54:33,838 --> 00:54:35,566
Not whatever I want.

655
00:55:03,070 --> 00:55:05,093
Lesson number 11.

656
00:55:06,669 --> 00:55:09,431
The greatest pleasure
for a woman in love...

657
00:55:09,503 --> 00:55:11,298
is pleasing her man.

658
00:55:11,369 --> 00:55:13,596
Clara, don't fall
in love with me.

659
00:55:17,036 --> 00:55:19,160
You should have
warned me before.

660
00:55:21,169 --> 00:55:23,465
"WELCOME"

661
00:55:33,402 --> 00:55:35,299
What are you doing here?

662
00:55:35,367 --> 00:55:36,856
I live here.

663
00:55:36,935 --> 00:55:40,197
I married you long before
you got Alzheimer's.

664
00:55:40,268 --> 00:55:43,700
- Where were you?
- I was at a class all morning.

665
00:55:43,768 --> 00:55:45,757
Dance class?

666
00:55:45,835 --> 00:55:48,959
Yeah, dance class.
What are you cooking, bull's tail?

667
00:55:50,835 --> 00:55:53,493
Bull's tail in brandy.

668
00:55:53,567 --> 00:55:55,999
Are we celebrating something?

669
00:55:56,067 --> 00:55:59,499
Our 12th anniversary.
I took the afternoon off.

670
00:55:59,567 --> 00:56:02,363
Sancho!
God, I'd completely forgotten!

671
00:56:02,434 --> 00:56:05,729
- I'm sorry.
- I can see that.

672
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:07,732
Go inside. I'll see to this.

673
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,828
Will you fix me a drink?

674
00:56:22,899 --> 00:56:25,422
You lie down like a guy
to watch TV.

675
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:28,761
I never knew that only men
lie on the sofa.

676
00:56:28,833 --> 00:56:30,355
So now you know.

677
00:56:31,866 --> 00:56:33,694
I'm tired.

678
00:56:33,765 --> 00:56:36,755
Well, you've been busting
your ass dancing.

679
00:56:36,833 --> 00:56:40,764
You quit seven years ago.
Why start again now?

680
00:56:40,832 --> 00:56:43,492
Maybe I'll go back to dancing.

681
00:56:44,698 --> 00:56:47,459
I need to be busy.

682
00:56:47,531 --> 00:56:49,587
Then take care of us.

683
00:56:51,897 --> 00:56:54,227
Sancho,
why don't we separate?

684
00:57:00,498 --> 00:57:02,554
Why don't we separate?

685
00:57:05,664 --> 00:57:08,459
As long as I love you,
you're not leaving me!

686
00:57:10,197 --> 00:57:13,061
One day I'll stop
being afraid of you, Sancho.

687
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:15,653
I feel that day
isn't too far off.

688
00:57:16,897 --> 00:57:19,192
I have to get back
to the kitchen.

689
00:57:19,263 --> 00:57:21,286
And never hit me again!

690
00:57:21,363 --> 00:57:23,591
It hurts me more
than it does you.

691
00:57:23,664 --> 00:57:25,891
All the more reason!

692
00:57:27,396 --> 00:57:29,192
You stay here.

693
00:57:29,263 --> 00:57:31,194
I'll set the table.

694
00:57:38,829 --> 00:57:40,455
Forgive me.

695
00:58:02,829 --> 00:58:05,726
<i>Even though
you may not believe it</i>

696
00:58:07,361 --> 00:58:10,588
<i>As God is my witness</i>

697
00:58:12,828 --> 00:58:16,385
<i>This will be our last meeting</i>

698
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:19,449
<i>You will understand.</i>

699
00:58:19,527 --> 00:58:23,391
<i>That even if you pretend</i>

700
00:58:23,459 --> 00:58:25,449
<i>To be in terrible pain</i>

701
00:58:26,527 --> 00:58:29,686
<i>You're not going to die</i>

702
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:33,658
<i>But abandon now</i>

703
00:58:44,592 --> 00:58:47,752
<i>That illusion</i>

704
00:58:47,826 --> 00:58:50,223
<i>To no one in the world</i>

705
00:58:50,292 --> 00:58:53,281
<i>Shall I give my heart</i>

706
00:58:57,458 --> 00:59:01,152
<i>Return my love so I may kill it</i>

707
00:59:04,458 --> 00:59:08,116
<i>Return the tenderness I showed</i>

708
00:59:08,191 --> 00:59:11,555
<i>You don't deserve to keep it</i>

709
00:59:11,624 --> 00:59:16,080
<i>You mean nothing to me now</i>

710
00:59:20,457 --> 00:59:25,582
<i>Give me back
my mother's rosary</i>

711
00:59:30,190 --> 00:59:32,679
<i>Everything else you may keep</i>

712
00:59:33,723 --> 00:59:37,314
<i>Your things I'll send you
any evening</i>

713
00:59:37,390 --> 00:59:42,379
<i>For you are not
to see me anymore</i>

714
00:59:42,619 --> 00:59:46,484
I'd do anything for the kids,
but you owe me two months.

715
00:59:46,554 --> 00:59:49,348
The council is slow
in paying us.

716
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:52,409
That Italian woman's loaded.
She can fork out.

717
00:59:52,487 --> 00:59:53,713
Really, Rosa.

718
00:59:53,786 --> 00:59:55,718
Clemen, we're going
to the dentist.

719
00:59:55,786 --> 00:59:58,876
If he mentions the bill,
get him to call me.

720
00:59:58,952 --> 01:00:00,248
400,000 pesetas.

721
01:00:00,319 --> 01:00:02,285
- Hello.
- David, what a surprise.

722
01:00:02,352 --> 01:00:04,249
- Is my wife here?
- Shall I get her?

723
01:00:04,318 --> 01:00:06,148
No, it's all right.
Thanks.

724
01:00:06,219 --> 01:00:08,412
Come on.
Just give me two days.

725
01:00:33,551 --> 01:00:35,881
Well, go and buy them
this afternoon.

726
01:00:35,951 --> 01:00:37,042
Thanks, Elena.

727
01:00:37,118 --> 01:00:38,707
- Hello, David.
- Hello.

728
01:00:40,050 --> 01:00:42,710
You look awful.
Are you all right?

729
01:00:42,784 --> 01:00:44,715
I saw Victor come in here.

730
01:00:46,983 --> 01:00:48,415
He works as a volunteer.

731
01:00:48,484 --> 01:00:50,472
What?

732
01:00:52,450 --> 01:00:54,383
David, please,
don't make a scene.

733
01:00:55,217 --> 01:00:56,807
How could you accept him?

734
01:00:56,882 --> 01:00:59,815
I didn't. I came in one day
and he was here.

735
01:00:59,883 --> 01:01:01,541
I don't understand.

736
01:01:01,615 --> 01:01:04,104
David, this isn't the army.

737
01:01:04,183 --> 01:01:07,615
I can't countermand the offers
without giving a reason.

738
01:01:07,682 --> 01:01:09,171
And Victor's a good worker.

739
01:01:10,682 --> 01:01:12,977
- Fuck that!
- What can I do?

740
01:01:22,016 --> 01:01:24,446
Victor, can't you see I'm busy?

741
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:27,969
Excuse me.
I'd like a word before you go.

742
01:01:28,048 --> 01:01:30,513
Yes, I'd like that too.

743
01:01:30,581 --> 01:01:32,672
Would you mind leaving us alone?

744
01:01:32,748 --> 01:01:34,408
Yes, I'd mind a lot!

745
01:01:34,482 --> 01:01:37,174
Don't worry, my love.
Nothing will happen.

746
01:01:38,414 --> 01:01:41,108
This is the last place
where you should have met.

747
01:01:45,715 --> 01:01:48,680
Victor, let's talk clearly.

748
01:01:48,747 --> 01:01:52,737
The woman who just left
through that door is my wife.

749
01:01:52,815 --> 01:01:54,336
I'm crazy about her.

750
01:01:54,413 --> 01:01:58,608
I'd do anything to defend her,
because she's all I have.

751
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:00,737
And like all cripples,
I've got a filthy temper.

752
01:02:00,814 --> 01:02:04,506
I'm sure you love your wife
and have a filthy temper.

753
01:02:04,579 --> 01:02:07,205
But it's not my business.

754
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:09,838
It is a bit, I think.

755
01:02:09,914 --> 01:02:14,039
Before I met you, I looked up
at the sun, the stars, the moon.

756
01:02:14,113 --> 01:02:16,806
Since I met you,
I have to look down...

757
01:02:16,879 --> 01:02:19,868
at dog shit
so I don't stain my hands...

758
01:02:19,946 --> 01:02:22,673
at curbs so I don't
crack my skull!

759
01:02:22,745 --> 01:02:24,211
You condemned me to look down!

760
01:02:24,279 --> 01:02:26,711
I didn't condemn you
to anything!

761
01:02:26,779 --> 01:02:28,676
I don't give a shit
if you fired by accident.

762
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:30,712
It wasn't an accident!

763
01:02:32,079 --> 01:02:35,476
- You did it on purpose?
- It wasn't me who shot you!

764
01:02:35,545 --> 01:02:38,171
It was Sancho!
Clara told me.

765
01:02:41,178 --> 01:02:43,974
How could he have shot me?
You had the gun.

766
01:02:48,545 --> 01:02:49,568
Get off!

767
01:02:49,645 --> 01:02:51,974
Victor, get off!
Let me go, please!

768
01:02:52,044 --> 01:02:53,601
Victor, please!

769
01:02:53,677 --> 01:02:56,575
I didn't want
to press the trigger!

770
01:02:57,644 --> 01:03:00,110
- Take the gun!
- What are you doing?

771
01:03:00,178 --> 01:03:02,735
Put your finger on the trigger,
but don't press it.

772
01:03:13,609 --> 01:03:17,201
I pressed the trigger,
but Sancho pressed my finger.

773
01:03:20,142 --> 01:03:23,575
He did it because
you were screwing his wife.

774
01:03:25,842 --> 01:03:28,138
Clara wanted
to leave him for you.

775
01:03:28,209 --> 01:03:29,800
He knew that.

776
01:03:31,309 --> 01:03:33,241
That's why he shot you.

777
01:03:57,442 --> 01:04:00,271
I spoke to Messengers of Peace.

778
01:04:00,340 --> 01:04:03,364
They have a house
for children with AIDS.

779
01:04:03,442 --> 01:04:06,305
I'm seeing them tomorrow.

780
01:04:06,374 --> 01:04:08,772
If they accept me,
I'll leave El Fontanar.

781
01:04:08,841 --> 01:04:11,466
I've already told the others.

782
01:04:11,540 --> 01:04:14,098
How can you leave?

783
01:04:14,174 --> 01:04:16,639
This way, Victor will have
no excuse to see me.

784
01:04:16,707 --> 01:04:18,639
I thought you'd be pleased.

785
01:04:18,707 --> 01:04:22,264
No, and I don't like you
being a martyr.

786
01:04:22,339 --> 01:04:25,362
They can let you leave?
You set up that house.

787
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:28,803
I'm not abandoning them.
I'll still help financially.

788
01:04:30,039 --> 01:04:32,801
What about the kids?
Your kids.

789
01:04:32,873 --> 01:04:35,963
I don't know
how I'll leave them.

790
01:04:36,039 --> 01:04:37,868
But I can't think
about myself.

791
01:04:37,939 --> 01:04:39,529
Come here, Elena.

792
01:04:39,605 --> 01:04:43,628
Come on. We'll smoke a joint
and relax a bit, all right?

793
01:04:43,706 --> 01:04:46,001
We've both had...

794
01:04:46,072 --> 01:04:47,504
a tough day.

795
01:04:49,472 --> 01:04:52,960
- You look pretty relaxed to me.
- I've already smoked one.

796
01:04:56,738 --> 01:04:59,170
What did you and Victor
talk about?

797
01:04:59,238 --> 01:05:01,761
Didn't he tell you?

798
01:05:01,839 --> 01:05:03,565
I didn't ask him.

799
01:05:03,638 --> 01:05:05,695
I'm asking you.

800
01:05:30,569 --> 01:05:32,502
So what did you talk about?

801
01:05:33,936 --> 01:05:35,527
Here.

802
01:05:39,869 --> 01:05:42,164
About the shooting.

803
01:05:42,235 --> 01:05:43,963
Victor says it wasn't him.

804
01:05:45,969 --> 01:05:48,526
But he had the gun.
I don't understand.

805
01:05:56,602 --> 01:05:58,966
There are things
I never told you.

806
01:06:01,802 --> 01:06:04,064
They happened before I met you.

807
01:06:08,835 --> 01:06:11,460
I was very close to Sancho...

808
01:06:11,535 --> 01:06:14,092
and also to Clara.

809
01:06:14,168 --> 01:06:16,226
Especially to Clara.

810
01:06:26,268 --> 01:06:28,563
Let it out.
Insult me if you want.

811
01:06:28,634 --> 01:06:31,123
Do whatever you want,
but say something.

812
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:38,732
Say something.

813
01:06:47,599 --> 01:06:49,531
Go to sleep, Aitor.

814
01:07:19,564 --> 01:07:22,258
Be careful.
You'll catch cold.

815
01:07:22,331 --> 01:07:25,160
I needed some air.

816
01:07:25,230 --> 01:07:28,026
David told me about the shooting.

817
01:07:28,098 --> 01:07:29,688
And?

818
01:07:30,963 --> 01:07:33,293
I can imagine how
you must have hated me...

819
01:07:33,364 --> 01:07:36,195
how you still hate me.

820
01:07:36,265 --> 01:07:38,196
How could I hate you?

821
01:07:39,264 --> 01:07:41,321
Do I look like I hate you now?

822
01:07:43,197 --> 01:07:46,595
Until recently, all I wanted
was to get revenge on you two.

823
01:07:46,664 --> 01:07:48,219
I even had a plan.

824
01:07:48,296 --> 01:07:50,660
- A plan of revenge?
- Yes.

825
01:07:50,730 --> 01:07:52,696
A ridiculous plan.

826
01:07:52,763 --> 01:07:54,695
Of all that happened that night...

827
01:07:54,762 --> 01:07:58,251
what hurt me most was that
you called me jerk-off...

828
01:07:58,329 --> 01:08:00,726
and said I couldn't fuck.

829
01:08:00,796 --> 01:08:03,558
I swore I'd make you
eat those words some day.

830
01:08:03,630 --> 01:08:06,095
Worst of all, it was true.

831
01:08:06,163 --> 01:08:09,288
So I decided that
when I got out of jail...

832
01:08:09,363 --> 01:08:11,123
I'd become the world's best lover.

833
01:08:11,195 --> 01:08:14,457
My plan was to spend
a whole night with you.

834
01:08:14,529 --> 01:08:17,586
During that night,
I'd fuck you nonstop...

835
01:08:17,661 --> 01:08:19,491
until I split you in two.

836
01:08:19,562 --> 01:08:23,289
I'd give you more pleasure
than you'd ever dreamed of.

837
01:08:25,128 --> 01:08:28,025
And naturally,
you would fall for me.

838
01:08:29,094 --> 01:08:31,959
But I'd dump you...

839
01:08:32,028 --> 01:08:36,119
and I'd never go back to you,
not even if you begged me.

840
01:08:37,961 --> 01:08:39,721
That was my revenge.

841
01:08:39,794 --> 01:08:41,726
That was my plan.

842
01:08:43,294 --> 01:08:44,885
Good-bye, Victor.

843
01:08:47,061 --> 01:08:48,391
Don't go so quickly.

844
01:08:50,594 --> 01:08:52,582
I'm leaving in a few days.

845
01:08:53,660 --> 01:08:56,491
I suppose we won't meet again.

846
01:09:02,459 --> 01:09:04,392
<i>In order to forget Elena...</i>

847
01:09:04,460 --> 01:09:07,620
<i>I got a job and started
reading the Bible again...</i>

848
01:09:07,694 --> 01:09:09,181
<i>as I did in jail.</i>

849
01:09:09,259 --> 01:09:14,282
<i>On the first day, God created the night
so that lovers couldn't sleep.</i>

850
01:09:14,359 --> 01:09:17,257
<i>He created water so that
it would drip constantly...</i>

851
01:09:17,325 --> 01:09:18,723
<i>from market roofs.</i>

852
01:09:18,793 --> 01:09:22,054
<i>And He created fish,
not to fill the seas with them...</i>

853
01:09:22,125 --> 01:09:24,489
<i>but so that I could
unload them before dawn...</i>

854
01:09:24,559 --> 01:09:28,184
<i>and, in that way,
not think about Elena...</i>

855
01:09:28,259 --> 01:09:30,851
<i>and not go insane.</i>

856
01:09:33,458 --> 01:09:36,391
What a fright, baby.
Give me a kiss.

857
01:09:36,459 --> 01:09:38,481
Give me a kiss!

858
01:09:38,558 --> 01:09:40,547
Squeeze me.
Come on.

859
01:09:41,792 --> 01:09:43,984
Where were you these two weeks?

860
01:09:44,058 --> 01:09:46,956
In Portugal.
You smell different.

861
01:09:47,024 --> 01:09:49,956
It's fish.
What were you doing?

862
01:09:50,024 --> 01:09:52,888
- Tourism, and a cure.
- Tourism.

863
01:09:54,323 --> 01:09:56,949
Didn't you get my card?

864
01:09:57,024 --> 01:09:58,546
I couldn't tell you before.

865
01:09:58,624 --> 01:10:00,556
Sancho suspects something...

866
01:10:00,624 --> 01:10:03,613
so he's reforming
to try to win me back.

867
01:10:05,024 --> 01:10:07,080
We even went to a clinic.

868
01:10:07,157 --> 01:10:09,146
The bastard's stopped drinking.

869
01:10:09,223 --> 01:10:10,519
And you?

870
01:10:10,590 --> 01:10:13,350
I'm drinking even more,
can't you see?

871
01:10:13,423 --> 01:10:15,356
I'm going to take a shower.

872
01:10:16,691 --> 01:10:18,679
Anything wrong?

873
01:10:18,756 --> 01:10:20,745
No, nothing.
I'm tired.

874
01:10:20,823 --> 01:10:25,016
I'm working at the market now,
as well as at the Shelter.

875
01:10:25,089 --> 01:10:27,112
Unloading crates.

876
01:10:27,189 --> 01:10:29,450
Why are you working so hard?

877
01:10:29,522 --> 01:10:31,352
What do you mean, why?

878
01:10:31,423 --> 01:10:33,355
I can't leech off you forever.

879
01:10:33,423 --> 01:10:36,820
- Why not?
- The things you say.

880
01:10:36,889 --> 01:10:38,479
Wait.

881
01:10:43,455 --> 01:10:45,386
We must stop meeting.

882
01:10:48,121 --> 01:10:50,519
Don't tell me that.

883
01:10:50,588 --> 01:10:52,883
I don't want anything from you.

884
01:10:54,021 --> 01:10:56,112
Just to see you occasionally.

885
01:10:56,188 --> 01:10:58,745
We both have
to sort out our lives...

886
01:10:58,821 --> 01:11:02,254
but we must do it separately.

887
01:11:02,321 --> 01:11:03,910
But why?

888
01:11:06,154 --> 01:11:09,177
I'm not asking you
to love me!

889
01:11:10,687 --> 01:11:13,210
I love you enough
for both of us.

890
01:11:16,020 --> 01:11:18,452
Clara, do you notice
an odd smell?

891
01:11:19,752 --> 01:11:22,878
Clara, I smell something odd.

892
01:11:22,953 --> 01:11:24,885
Christ, the frying pan!

893
01:11:47,218 --> 01:11:50,184
Are you crazy?
What's up with you?

894
01:11:50,252 --> 01:11:52,911
Christ! Shit!

895
01:11:52,985 --> 01:11:54,314
Fucking hell!

896
01:12:23,016 --> 01:12:24,948
I thought you weren't coming.

897
01:12:25,016 --> 01:12:26,949
I had a problem at home.

898
01:12:27,017 --> 01:12:28,982
They're asleep.
It's all been done.

899
01:12:29,050 --> 01:12:31,209
Great.
Thanks a lot.

900
01:12:31,283 --> 01:12:34,146
Go see your girl.
And happy birthday!

901
01:12:34,215 --> 01:12:36,148
Kiss her for me.

902
01:12:57,715 --> 01:13:00,510
"THE SONG OF SOLOMON"

903
01:13:16,014 --> 01:13:17,480
I didn't know you were here.

904
01:13:20,580 --> 01:13:23,978
I came to get my things
from the office.

905
01:13:24,048 --> 01:13:26,673
Don't go.
If anyone has to go, it's me.

906
01:13:26,746 --> 01:13:29,338
Be quiet.

907
01:13:29,414 --> 01:13:31,879
Promise that
you won't look for me...

908
01:13:31,946 --> 01:13:33,639
and we won't meet again.

909
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:42,040
- Promise me.
- Yes, I promise.

910
01:14:23,177 --> 01:14:28,666
<i>We are in an impossible dream</i>

911
01:14:28,743 --> 01:14:31,904
<i>Seeking the night</i>

912
01:14:34,078 --> 01:14:41,101
<i>To forget in its shadows
the world and all else</i>

913
01:14:43,576 --> 01:14:47,565
<i>We, in our daydream</i>

914
01:14:47,643 --> 01:14:50,666
<i>Painful and beloved</i>

915
01:14:53,976 --> 01:14:57,806
<i>Two leaves that the wind</i>

916
01:14:59,842 --> 01:15:04,206
<i>Brought together in autumn</i>

917
01:15:10,975 --> 01:15:19,272
<i>We are two beings in one
who, loving each other, die</i>

918
01:15:24,142 --> 01:15:31,630
<i>To keep the secret
of their love</i>

919
01:15:34,941 --> 01:15:40,873
<i>But what will life matter</i>

920
01:15:40,940 --> 01:15:45,463
<i>When we are separated</i>

921
01:15:46,607 --> 01:15:54,097
<i>We are two teardrops
in a song</i>

922
01:15:57,340 --> 01:16:01,738
<i>But what will life matter</i>

923
01:16:04,540 --> 01:16:06,300
Dawn's breaking.

924
01:16:09,572 --> 01:16:16,801
<i>We are two teardrops
in a song</i>

925
01:16:20,272 --> 01:16:24,897
<i>Nothing more</i>

926
01:16:24,972 --> 01:16:27,598
<i>Are we</i>

927
01:16:28,904 --> 01:16:35,700
<i>Nothing more</i>

928
01:18:56,399 --> 01:18:59,023
- David?
- Yes. Did I wake you?

929
01:18:59,097 --> 01:19:01,325
I didn't expect you so soon.

930
01:19:02,598 --> 01:19:05,791
I came back on my own
from Seville in a taxi.

931
01:19:05,864 --> 01:19:08,262
I didn't wait for the team.

932
01:19:08,331 --> 01:19:10,092
Go to sleep.
You must be exhausted.

933
01:19:10,164 --> 01:19:12,357
No, I'm not tired.

934
01:19:20,398 --> 01:19:22,454
What's up?
Not in the mood?

935
01:19:22,530 --> 01:19:23,757
It isn't that.

936
01:19:23,830 --> 01:19:26,194
It hurts.

937
01:19:26,262 --> 01:19:28,592
It hurts?
How come?

938
01:19:30,163 --> 01:19:32,287
I was fucking all night.

939
01:20:04,862 --> 01:20:07,622
- What are you doing?
- I'm leaving.

940
01:20:07,694 --> 01:20:08,785
To go where?

941
01:20:10,728 --> 01:20:11,751
Far away.

942
01:20:11,828 --> 01:20:13,850
Clara, don't start.

943
01:20:15,261 --> 01:20:17,318
Give me an Alka-Seltzer.
My head's exploding.

944
01:20:24,227 --> 01:20:25,420
Let me past.

945
01:20:25,494 --> 01:20:27,426
Why not forget last night?

946
01:20:59,058 --> 01:21:00,149
Take it easy, Clara.

947
01:21:00,225 --> 01:21:02,317
Give me the keys and let me go.

948
01:21:02,393 --> 01:21:04,290
We deserve another chance.

949
01:21:04,358 --> 01:21:07,552
We've had too many.

950
01:21:07,625 --> 01:21:09,783
Get out of the way.

951
01:21:09,858 --> 01:21:11,915
I can change.

952
01:21:11,991 --> 01:21:14,514
I proved it last week,
didn't I?

953
01:21:16,824 --> 01:21:19,154
- Fuck. Forgive me!
- I forgive you.

954
01:21:55,056 --> 01:21:56,079
Who was it?

955
01:21:58,722 --> 01:22:00,689
Knowing that won't help you.

956
01:22:00,757 --> 01:22:02,619
You doing it hasn't helped me.

957
01:22:05,156 --> 01:22:06,586
It was Victor.

958
01:22:08,188 --> 01:22:09,677
Bastard! I knew it!

959
01:22:11,822 --> 01:22:15,254
It was my fault.
It won't happen again.

960
01:22:15,322 --> 01:22:17,185
Why should I believe you?

961
01:22:17,255 --> 01:22:19,243
I never lie, David.

962
01:22:19,321 --> 01:22:23,482
That's true.
Yes, you're offensively honest.

963
01:22:25,987 --> 01:22:27,453
What will you do now?

964
01:22:27,521 --> 01:22:29,952
Stay with you,
if you don't throw me out.

965
01:22:30,021 --> 01:22:33,112
- Didn't you enjoy it?
- I didn't say that.

966
01:22:33,187 --> 01:22:35,550
Then why the fuck
stay with me?

967
01:22:36,620 --> 01:22:38,553
You need me more than he does.

968
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:48,647
Right. I'll keep exploiting
your guilt complex.

969
01:23:06,252 --> 01:23:08,310
David!

970
01:23:10,685 --> 01:23:12,618
David, open the door!

971
01:23:13,753 --> 01:23:15,684
What are you doing?

972
01:23:17,185 --> 01:23:18,412
So long.

973
01:23:18,486 --> 01:23:20,418
Please, open the door!

974
01:23:26,052 --> 01:23:27,642
- Where are you going?
- Training.

975
01:23:27,718 --> 01:23:29,308
Are you sure?

976
01:23:30,785 --> 01:23:32,716
Of course I'm sure.

977
01:23:40,384 --> 01:23:43,112
Who are you worried about,
me or him?

978
01:23:43,184 --> 01:23:44,672
The three of us.

979
01:24:08,816 --> 01:24:10,748
Who did he speak to?

980
01:24:19,715 --> 01:24:21,238
<i>Yes?</i>

981
01:24:21,316 --> 01:24:25,179
<i>Clara, is that you?</i>

982
01:24:27,582 --> 01:24:29,208
Clara, answer me.

983
01:24:32,649 --> 01:24:35,512
Wherever you hide,
I swear I'll find you.

984
01:24:50,081 --> 01:24:52,172
This time you've had
a serious row.

985
01:24:52,248 --> 01:24:53,611
No, not at all.

986
01:24:53,680 --> 01:24:57,272
We were doing really well.
I'd stopped drinking.

987
01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:00,776
But she flipped out...

988
01:25:00,847 --> 01:25:02,904
and belted me
with her beauty case.

989
01:25:02,980 --> 01:25:06,105
Is that a bullet wound?

990
01:25:06,180 --> 01:25:09,408
She didn't mean to hit me.
It's just a scratch.

991
01:25:09,481 --> 01:25:14,606
If you'd had your back to her,
you could've ended up like me.

992
01:25:14,680 --> 01:25:17,305
I wouldn't mind ending up
in a wheelchair...

993
01:25:17,380 --> 01:25:18,936
if I could get Clara back.

994
01:25:19,013 --> 01:25:20,809
You stupid bastard.

995
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:22,243
- What?
- Nothing.

996
01:25:30,179 --> 01:25:32,338
- You got any coke?
- Coke?

997
01:25:32,413 --> 01:25:34,435
No. Why do you want it?

998
01:25:34,512 --> 01:25:37,171
I don't want to cry.

999
01:25:37,245 --> 01:25:39,733
Cocaine drys up your tears.

1000
01:25:39,811 --> 01:25:41,902
It cools you down.

1001
01:25:41,978 --> 01:25:43,911
Let me help you.

1002
01:25:45,145 --> 01:25:47,008
Come on.
Let me help you.

1003
01:25:47,078 --> 01:25:48,668
Fuck!

1004
01:25:57,144 --> 01:25:59,235
Give me that.

1005
01:25:59,311 --> 01:26:00,937
Thanks, David.

1006
01:26:04,277 --> 01:26:06,402
What did you want to tell me?

1007
01:26:06,478 --> 01:26:09,137
- Clara sent you, right?
- No.

1008
01:26:09,211 --> 01:26:12,609
- Really?
- Clara hasn't seen me in ages.

1009
01:26:12,676 --> 01:26:14,609
But I've seen her.

1010
01:26:16,310 --> 01:26:17,901
Look.

1011
01:26:32,043 --> 01:26:34,941
You love Crispies.
Why won't you eat them?

1012
01:26:35,010 --> 01:26:36,600
And what's up with you?

1013
01:26:36,676 --> 01:26:38,938
You're big enough
to feed yourself.

1014
01:26:39,009 --> 01:26:41,372
Oh, he didn't like that at all.

1015
01:26:42,575 --> 01:26:44,667
<i>- Yes?
- Hello, Clemen.</i>

1016
01:26:44,742 --> 01:26:46,800
<i>- This is Elena.
- Hi, Elena. What's up?</i>

1017
01:26:46,876 --> 01:26:48,068
Is Victor there?

1018
01:26:48,141 --> 01:26:49,402
No, he isn't.

1019
01:26:49,475 --> 01:26:51,839
Where is he?

1020
01:26:51,908 --> 01:26:54,339
<i>Listen, Elena. You said
you didn't want to see him.</i>

1021
01:26:56,009 --> 01:26:57,236
It's important.

1022
01:26:58,807 --> 01:27:01,273
<i>You said that if he asked
for your address...</i>

1023
01:27:01,341 --> 01:27:03,330
<i>we weren't to give it,
and now-</i>

1024
01:27:04,540 --> 01:27:06,472
Now I'm asking for his.
What is it?

1025
01:27:06,540 --> 01:27:09,200
<i>Really, I can't believe this.</i>

1026
01:27:09,274 --> 01:27:11,330
<i>Don't think that
because you fund us...</i>

1027
01:27:11,407 --> 01:27:14,703
<i>you have the right
to boss us around.</i>

1028
01:27:14,774 --> 01:27:17,638
Don't torture me.
I've tortured myself enough.

1029
01:27:17,707 --> 01:27:20,037
Don't get like that.

1030
01:27:20,108 --> 01:27:23,164
Victor lives in La Ventilla,
in one of the pre-fabs.

1031
01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:38,771
Not only did she
fix up his house.

1032
01:27:38,839 --> 01:27:42,237
He's been screwing her
since he got out of jail.

1033
01:27:48,839 --> 01:27:50,566
Where does he live?

1034
01:28:28,704 --> 01:28:30,066
My boy!

1035
01:28:52,269 --> 01:28:54,598
<i>Dear Victor...</i>

1036
01:28:54,669 --> 01:28:58,261
<i>I'd like you to keep this note
among the pages of your Bible...</i>

1037
01:28:58,336 --> 01:29:01,529
<i>along with the things
you most love.</i>

1038
01:29:01,602 --> 01:29:04,396
<i>When you read this,
I will be dead or running away.</i>

1039
01:29:04,468 --> 01:29:08,128
<i>You mustn't feel responsible
or pity me.</i>

1040
01:29:08,202 --> 01:29:10,167
<i>When I came to your door...</i>

1041
01:29:10,234 --> 01:29:12,962
<i>I knew I'd end up
like this neighborhood...</i>

1042
01:29:13,035 --> 01:29:14,524
<i>expropriated and destroyed.</i>

1043
01:29:14,602 --> 01:29:17,829
<i>But I have no regrets,
nor do I blame you, my love.</i>

1044
01:29:17,901 --> 01:29:22,299
<i>Before I met you, I was already
condemned to disappear.</i>

1045
01:29:22,368 --> 01:29:25,425
<i>I'm leaving your key
and some money.</i>

1046
01:29:25,501 --> 01:29:30,126
<i>I couldn't get any more because
I'm running away from Sancho.</i>

1047
01:29:30,201 --> 01:29:32,167
<i>Get out of Madrid.</i>

1048
01:29:32,234 --> 01:29:36,223
<i>I know you have more reason
than ever to stay now...</i>

1049
01:29:36,301 --> 01:29:38,857
<i>but Elena will understand too.</i>

1050
01:29:41,900 --> 01:29:44,230
<i>Keep away from Sancho.</i>

1051
01:29:44,301 --> 01:29:47,494
<i>It would be pointless
to confront him.</i>

1052
01:29:47,567 --> 01:29:51,658
<i>People like you and me
weren't born to kill.</i>

1053
01:29:51,733 --> 01:29:53,858
<i>We may hurt others...</i>

1054
01:29:53,933 --> 01:29:57,888
<i>I would even say we have
a special gift for that...</i>

1055
01:29:57,966 --> 01:29:59,898
<i>but we don't kill them.</i>

1056
01:30:02,065 --> 01:30:04,122
<i>There he is.</i>

1057
01:30:06,166 --> 01:30:08,926
<i>I'm sure it's him.</i>

1058
01:30:08,999 --> 01:30:12,056
<i>I know the way
he hammers on doors.</i>

1059
01:30:13,765 --> 01:30:15,628
Good-bye, Victor.

1060
01:30:29,465 --> 01:30:30,555
Where's Victor?

1061
01:30:30,631 --> 01:30:33,722
He's gone.
He doesn't live here anymore.

1062
01:30:35,031 --> 01:30:36,621
Where does he live?

1063
01:30:37,897 --> 01:30:40,056
I don't know.

1064
01:30:43,631 --> 01:30:47,064
What are we going to do now?
Shoot each other?

1065
01:30:48,796 --> 01:30:51,262
Tell me another way
to settle it.

1066
01:30:51,330 --> 01:30:52,921
That depends on you.

1067
01:31:27,029 --> 01:31:28,823
This sums up my life.

1068
01:31:29,729 --> 01:31:32,718
Dragging myself along
to be near you.

1069
01:31:37,729 --> 01:31:40,819
I should have ripped
your balls off that night.

1070
01:31:48,661 --> 01:31:49,922
Shoot!

1071
01:31:52,227 --> 01:31:54,921
What's keeping you?

1072
01:31:54,994 --> 01:31:58,392
Will I have to shoot
for you again?

1073
01:32:00,027 --> 01:32:02,390
You stole six years of my life.

1074
01:32:02,460 --> 01:32:05,585
You stole much more from me.

1075
01:32:06,361 --> 01:32:08,087
Clara didn't belong to you.

1076
01:32:09,126 --> 01:32:11,854
Your life didn't belong to you.

1077
01:32:18,660 --> 01:32:21,557
No one ever owns his youth...

1078
01:32:24,126 --> 01:32:26,114
or the woman he loves.

1079
01:32:27,225 --> 01:32:29,555
It can't be!

1080
01:32:29,626 --> 01:32:31,524
David!

1081
01:32:31,592 --> 01:32:33,615
What are you doing here?

1082
01:33:19,889 --> 01:33:21,947
<i>Elena, I'm in Miami.</i>

1083
01:33:23,723 --> 01:33:26,951
<i>I'm spending the holiday here
with some friends.</i>

1084
01:33:28,022 --> 01:33:31,012
<i>It's my first Christmas
in the sun...</i>

1085
01:33:31,090 --> 01:33:34,078
<i>and the first in six years
without you.</i>

1086
01:33:37,222 --> 01:33:40,017
<i>Although it hurts me
to admit it...</i>

1087
01:33:40,089 --> 01:33:42,385
<i>I understand you more than ever.</i>

1088
01:33:43,989 --> 01:33:46,978
<i>I understand your lack ofjoy...</i>

1089
01:33:47,055 --> 01:33:49,385
<i>why I so rarely saw you laugh.</i>

1090
01:33:51,887 --> 01:33:53,820
<i>Don't feel guilty about anything.</i>

1091
01:33:53,888 --> 01:33:58,615
<i>I'm to blame for what happened
in Eduardo Dato...</i>

1092
01:33:58,687 --> 01:34:01,085
<i>and for the massacre
in La Ventilla.</i>

1093
01:34:02,921 --> 01:34:04,784
<i>Look on this declaration
of guilt...</i>

1094
01:34:04,854 --> 01:34:07,785
<i>as a declaration of love...</i>

1095
01:34:09,654 --> 01:34:11,586
<i>and as my Christmas gift.</i>

1096
01:34:22,053 --> 01:34:24,611
- Victor!
- Yes?

1097
01:34:24,687 --> 01:34:27,084
Is it time?
Come on!

1098
01:34:39,820 --> 01:34:41,911
Good-bye!

1099
01:34:41,987 --> 01:34:43,679
-Josep!
- What?

1100
01:34:43,752 --> 01:34:45,741
- Hurry!
- Which way do I go?

1101
01:34:45,819 --> 01:34:47,977
- The fastest way!
- Where's that?

1102
01:34:48,051 --> 01:34:51,449
- Through the center.
- No, we'll never make it.

1103
01:34:51,518 --> 01:34:54,382
Everyone's watching
the big soccer game.

1104
01:34:54,452 --> 01:34:56,941
We'll make it.
Come on, breathe.

1105
01:34:57,018 --> 01:35:00,575
Hang on, my love.
And you, don't be so impatient.

1106
01:35:00,651 --> 01:35:03,277
Come on, love.
Do the seal.

1107
01:35:03,352 --> 01:35:05,943
Come on,Josep.
The seal!

1108
01:35:13,684 --> 01:35:15,741
The contractions!

1109
01:35:15,818 --> 01:35:18,613
Don't be so impatient.
Hang on.

1110
01:35:19,718 --> 01:35:22,376
I'll try to convince him.

1111
01:35:22,450 --> 01:35:24,473
I know exactly how you feel.

1112
01:35:24,550 --> 01:35:29,006
I was in the same situation
26 years ago, about to be born.

1113
01:35:29,083 --> 01:35:31,709
But you're much luckier
than I was.

1114
01:35:31,783 --> 01:35:33,409
It's so different now.

1115
01:35:33,484 --> 01:35:35,915
Look at the sidewalk
full of people.

1116
01:35:35,983 --> 01:35:38,313
When I was born,
there wasn't a soul on the street.

1117
01:35:38,383 --> 01:35:40,940
People were shut up at home,
scared shitless.

1118
01:35:41,016 --> 01:35:42,141
Fortunately for you, son...

1119
01:35:42,216 --> 01:35:45,704
in Spain we stopped being scared
a long time ago.
