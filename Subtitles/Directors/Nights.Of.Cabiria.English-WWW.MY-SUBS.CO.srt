2
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:22,366
Go over there.

3
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:31,332
It's beautiful!
Come on!

4
00:03:52,042 --> 00:03:53,408
Giorgio!

5
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:58,747
Help... Help!

6
00:04:06,792 --> 00:04:09,705
Help! Somebody's drowning!

7
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:28,324
Where's Romolo?

8
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,036
He went to City Hall.

9
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:32,575
To hell with City Hall!

10
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,707
It's a woman.

11
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,036
There she is!

12
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:41,700
Tino's not here either?

13
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:43,787
Is she trying to drown herself?

14
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:46,245
There she is.
Go in after her.

15
00:04:46,417 --> 00:04:50,115
Jump! If she gets to the sewer
she won't come up again.

16
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,625
A woman's drowning!

17
00:04:55,417 --> 00:04:58,615
You guys head her off.
I'll go in after her.

18
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:19,290
Pascello!

19
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:20,619
Run! Come over here!

20
00:05:20,792 --> 00:05:23,079
What are you doing?
Not like that!

21
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,411
Turn her upside down.

22
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:26,620
Stefano, hurry up!

23
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:29,199
Where'd you fish her out?

24
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:31,958
Careful.
Hold her under the stomach.

25
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:33,125
She was drowning!

26
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,951
She probably slipped.
Mario saw her.

27
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:37,832
She must have slipped
and fell in.

28
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,957
- Did she jump off the bridge?
- No.

29
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:41,832
- Did she go under?
- 3 times.

30
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,208
- At least 7 times!
- 10 times!

31
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:48,369
She must have swallowed a lot.
We'll need some help. Stefano!

32
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,162
- What happened?
- Hurry!

33
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:57,745
- Faster with the arms!
- She lost a shoe.

34
00:06:00,292 --> 00:06:01,954
I think she's dead.

35
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:09,823
Get the water out,
before it's too late.

36
00:06:12,667 --> 00:06:14,829
Look how it's rushing out.
Move it, kids!

37
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,457
We saved her!

38
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:18,116
Beat it!

39
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:21,417
Let's get Pompeo.
He never seen anyone drown before.

40
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:22,417
Look.

41
00:06:22,418 --> 00:06:24,750
I don't wanna look.
I'm afraid.

42
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,741
Looks dead to me.

43
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:34,450
Corpses don't throw up water.

44
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:35,866
She opened her eyes!

45
00:06:37,542 --> 00:06:39,704
She opened her eyes!
Put her down.

46
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:41,707
We'll give her
artificial respiration.

47
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:43,161
She's bleeding.

48
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:45,290
It's just a scratch.

49
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:49,869
What she needs is brandy.

50
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:52,125
Brandy nothing!
What she needs is milk.

51
00:06:56,583 --> 00:07:00,452
Quiet! She's coming to. You, with
the motorbike, go get some milk.

52
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:02,287
I'm outta gas.

53
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:04,870
Take it easy now.

54
00:07:05,042 --> 00:07:08,956
You're all right.
You can thank the Holy Father.

55
00:07:09,417 --> 00:07:10,578
You're fine.

56
00:07:11,667 --> 00:07:13,954
- Where's Giorgio?
- Which Giorgio?

57
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:19,574
Where are you going?

58
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:26,411
Who's she looking for?

59
00:07:32,917 --> 00:07:34,704
- Wasn't she alone?
- Yes.

60
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,541
Who does he think he is?

61
00:07:40,917 --> 00:07:42,283
Take it easy. Come here.

62
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:43,824
I'm going home!

63
00:07:44,792 --> 00:07:45,873
Where's my shoes?

64
00:07:46,042 --> 00:07:48,284
Here. There's only one.

65
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:53,542
She's got 7 souls... like a cat!

66
00:07:54,167 --> 00:07:55,783
See? She can hardly stand up.

67
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:57,915
Poor thing. She's in bad shape.

68
00:07:58,083 --> 00:08:00,245
You were almost dead.

69
00:08:00,417 --> 00:08:01,533
Leave me alone!

70
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:02,744
Let go of me!

71
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:06,074
Hey! We're the ones
who saved you!

72
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,412
Fine. You saved me...

73
00:08:09,292 --> 00:08:10,749
Now I wanna go home, O.K.?

74
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,959
O.K. Suit yourself.
Go home. Goodbye.

75
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:18,619
Hi, Cabiria.

76
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:19,991
You know her?

77
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:21,167
Sure. She's Cabiria.

78
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:22,833
Where's she live?

79
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:27,157
On Via Cecilia, near the gas
station. She lives the life...

80
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:55,291
Giorgio! Open up! It's me!

81
00:08:57,667 --> 00:08:59,454
It's me! Cabiria!

82
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Wanda!

83
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,707
Wanda! Have you seen Giorgio?

84
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,245
What happened to you?

85
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:31,662
Mind your own business.
Did you see Giorgio?

86
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:34,291
- Which Giorgio?
- My Giorgio.

87
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:38,574
What happened to you?

88
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:44,790
What do you want from me?

89
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:46,833
What do you want?

90
00:09:46,917 --> 00:09:50,160
I don't want nothing.
You mind your own ass!

91
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:10,163
Go inside and dry yourself off.

92
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:11,869
I don't have the keys.

93
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:13,744
Where'd you put them?

94
00:10:13,917 --> 00:10:15,283
In my purse.

95
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:20,208
Where's your purse?

96
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:22,037
Giorgio's got it.

97
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:27,910
We took a walk by the river and...

98
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:29,790
...I fell in.

99
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:32,700
He got scared and ran away.

100
00:10:35,542 --> 00:10:37,784
Cabiria! Open up!

101
00:10:40,042 --> 00:10:41,624
Come on, open up.

102
00:10:41,792 --> 00:10:43,533
I gotta sleep!

103
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:51,538
Tell me something, Cabiria.

104
00:10:51,792 --> 00:10:55,160
How much did you have
in your purse? Answer me.

105
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:18,121
If you see Giorgio, I'm right here.

106
00:11:38,792 --> 00:11:41,250
What are you doing?

107
00:11:41,417 --> 00:11:43,329
You're right to stay home.

108
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,708
Go to bed
and get some sleep.

109
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:48,242
I'll see you later
when I get back.

110
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:53,074
Why didn't you take your aspirin?

111
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:54,832
Take it, it'll do you good.

112
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,332
You still here?

113
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,332
Aren't you tired of yakkin'?

114
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,412
Can't you see I had enough?

115
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:05,248
Get lost! Who told you
we were friends?

116
00:12:05,417 --> 00:12:07,374
Get lost, will you?

117
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:12,280
And don't come borrowing
my thermometer anymore!

118
00:12:12,417 --> 00:12:15,376
Who's asking you for anything?

119
00:12:15,542 --> 00:12:17,078
What a nut!

120
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,286
You're a sweetheart!

121
00:12:28,667 --> 00:12:31,501
Someone would throw you in the
river for 40,000 lire?

122
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:34,330
Drown you for 40,000 lire?

123
00:12:34,667 --> 00:12:37,660
Nowadays they'll do it for 5,000.

124
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:39,074
Someone who loves you?

125
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:42,705
What love?
You met him a month ago!

126
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:45,117
You don't know his name
or where he lives.

127
00:12:45,292 --> 00:12:48,035
Can't you understand?
He pushed you in!

128
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:50,700
He pushed you in the river!

129
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:53,575
And you were lucky, because me

130
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:56,618
I'd have held your head
under myself! You nut!

131
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:58,915
Tell the cops!

132
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:01,166
I'm no stool pigeon.

133
00:13:01,917 --> 00:13:03,374
Take my advice!

134
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,500
Report him!

135
00:13:07,167 --> 00:13:09,454
But why? Why'd he do it?

136
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:11,116
I gave him everything.

137
00:13:11,292 --> 00:13:13,500
I gave him everything he wanted.

138
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:15,624
He didn't have to do it.

139
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:25,949
I'm such a moron.

140
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:56,870
What if I died?

141
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,992
That's it! The party's over!

142
00:14:25,167 --> 00:14:27,659
We're through! Finished!

143
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:30,997
Silk shirts!
I'll give you silk shirts!

144
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:33,955
Find another jerk like me!

145
00:14:34,167 --> 00:14:36,705
Look what I bought him!

146
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:38,332
Checked suit!

147
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,741
Camel-hair coat!

148
00:14:39,917 --> 00:14:42,580
Never again! Never!

149
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,288
And who's gonna feed you now?

150
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:47,619
St. Peter?

151
00:14:47,792 --> 00:14:49,374
Eternal love!

152
00:14:49,542 --> 00:14:51,499
You dirty vitellone!

153
00:14:51,667 --> 00:14:54,455
Go back to selling balloons!

154
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:59,867
I'll burn it all!

155
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:02,583
Chicken soup, veal chops...

156
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,458
You should drop dead!

157
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:25,661
This is the last time!

158
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:27,995
You'll never see me here again.

159
00:15:28,167 --> 00:15:29,167
This is my last evening.

160
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,583
I shouldn't even
be seen with you!

161
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:35,780
Look how classy I am.

162
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:38,826
You look like Moby Dick to me.

163
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,286
How dare you!

164
00:15:41,167 --> 00:15:42,749
Know where you belong?

165
00:15:42,917 --> 00:15:45,375
In the nuthouse!

166
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,492
Use your eyes!

167
00:15:47,667 --> 00:15:49,499
Take a good look at me!

168
00:15:49,667 --> 00:15:53,411
Look at me. A grande dame.

169
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:58,621
She gets worse all the time.

170
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:01,500
They oughta put her away.

171
00:16:01,667 --> 00:16:03,408
That's how you'll end up!

172
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,119
And that's the heater...

173
00:16:05,292 --> 00:16:07,579
- This car's got everything.
- Even Coca-Cola.

174
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:10,163
- Gimme a ride?
- This ain't no tank!

175
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:12,290
- Get out!
- I'm not getting out.

176
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:13,699
Come on, move!

177
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,334
- Why should I?
- I'm taking Wanda for a ride.

178
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:20,370
You don't know how to drive.

179
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,366
It's my car.
I do what I want.

180
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,416
Get out.

181
00:16:23,417 --> 00:16:25,283
I'll visit you in the hospital.

182
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:26,869
This I gotta see.

183
00:16:27,042 --> 00:16:28,533
Why not the bigger model?

184
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:30,995
Another one!
What do you know about cars?

185
00:16:31,167 --> 00:16:33,159
You're always in the bushes!

186
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:37,120
You're always on two wheels!

187
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:45,246
Here comes the psycho again.

188
00:16:46,292 --> 00:16:47,658
- 'Bye, handsome.
- 'Bye, sweetie.

189
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:50,667
Remember to come see
your princess.

190
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:58,416
Cute! Real fancy!

191
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:00,916
Me, I'd have picked a grey one.

192
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:02,324
It's a fancier color.

193
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,991
But this one's cute.

194
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:05,866
You're gonna kill the battery!

195
00:17:06,042 --> 00:17:08,876
Wanda, get out.
I don't want to argue tonight.

196
00:17:09,042 --> 00:17:11,204
Neither do I, you fanatic.

197
00:17:11,667 --> 00:17:14,159
Still, a Fiat is a Fiat.

198
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,450
With a car,
life's a lot different.

199
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:18,582
You sit up there, high up,

200
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:21,037
and you signal right, left...

201
00:17:24,042 --> 00:17:27,831
People think you're well off...
a secretary, a daddy's girl...

202
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,287
The men all chase you.

203
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:31,699
It feels great!

204
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:33,832
- Listen to her!
- What?

205
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,834
I know how she got that car!

206
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:38,911
That cokehead!

207
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:40,199
Wait!

208
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:41,375
Stay right here!

209
00:17:41,376 --> 00:17:44,288
- Let me get out!
- Stay!

210
00:17:52,167 --> 00:17:53,703
Dance, Cabiria!

211
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:55,207
You're in luck!

212
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:57,492
I'm the best dancer in Rome.

213
00:17:57,792 --> 00:17:59,203
Come on!

214
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:07,826
Now she found another
deadbeat to say "I love you".

215
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,164
One who'll send her off begging.

216
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:15,031
Get off the street, dear,
or I'll have you arrested.

217
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:21,458
Here I am, gentlemen!

218
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:23,116
Here I am!

219
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:24,574
Just as well.

220
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,332
Who needs you?

221
00:18:27,042 --> 00:18:31,537
Where you going with the car?
To the old-age home?

222
00:18:31,667 --> 00:18:34,455
Maybe if you were 20 years
younger!

223
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:36,290
Filthy flea bag!

224
00:18:36,417 --> 00:18:38,875
You're just jealous!

225
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,286
Hear that, Cabiria?

226
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:44,166
She can't get away with that!

227
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:47,121
Look how you'll end up,
you lousy whore!

228
00:18:47,792 --> 00:18:49,749
"Please... be kind...

229
00:18:49,917 --> 00:18:52,580
Have a heart!"

230
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:56,325
"Please, for my Giorgio's sake!"

231
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:00,620
Do it! Poke her eyes out!

232
00:19:00,792 --> 00:19:02,374
Wanda, here we go again.

233
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:13,078
Forza, Cabiria!

234
00:19:14,042 --> 00:19:15,999
Never mind her!

235
00:19:16,792 --> 00:19:19,284
Hit her low, in the belly!

236
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:21,915
Don't stop them!

237
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:23,665
It's too much fun!

238
00:19:23,792 --> 00:19:25,829
Stop it before the cops come!

239
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,290
I'll kill her!

240
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,992
Let go of me!

241
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:38,449
Get her in the car.

242
00:19:40,167 --> 00:19:41,954
Get her away!

243
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:44,996
- Leave me alone!
- Get inside!

244
00:19:45,167 --> 00:19:46,453
I'll punch you a new face!

245
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:53,038
It's not over yet!

246
00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:59,074
She ruined my face!

247
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,912
Forget about her.

248
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:10,117
You're scared of me, right?

249
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:12,708
You lousy loser!

250
00:20:17,042 --> 00:20:18,908
Have a smoke.

251
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,788
Where you wanna go?

252
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:24,208
To Via Veneto.

253
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:25,167
Via Veneto?

254
00:20:25,168 --> 00:20:27,376
Think you're the Empress Poppea?

255
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:30,699
Cabiria, you and me oughta

256
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:33,743
have a talk one of these days.

257
00:20:33,917 --> 00:20:35,624
You're not doing it right.

258
00:20:35,792 --> 00:20:37,579
Who's watching over you?

259
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,116
Look at Marisa and me.

260
00:20:40,292 --> 00:20:42,329
She's safe wherever she goes.

261
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,787
Nobody in Rome would harm her.

262
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:47,575
You know why? Tell me.

263
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:49,824
Let me out.

264
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:55,205
What do you expect
to do here?

265
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:58,447
Girls fight for spots
on Via Veneto and Villa Borghese.

266
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:02,869
Cabiria, why not find yourself
a serious man like me?

267
00:21:03,792 --> 00:21:04,792
I don't need one.

268
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:07,575
- I say you do.
- I say I don't!

269
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:12,040
Why should I slave
for filthy pigs like you?

270
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:13,208
Let's drop it.

271
00:21:13,292 --> 00:21:15,909
Yeah, drop it.
Better let me out.

272
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:17,699
Yeah, it's better.

273
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:27,033
So long!

274
00:22:19,917 --> 00:22:24,617
Degenerate! Go take a walk
on the Passeggiata Archeologica!

275
00:23:22,292 --> 00:23:25,911
Can't I look?
Know how gorgeous you are?

276
00:23:26,667 --> 00:23:27,748
Get going.

277
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:32,626
Yeah? I'm staying right here!
See?

278
00:23:43,417 --> 00:23:44,453
Sorry.

279
00:23:45,333 --> 00:23:46,369
Are you blind?

280
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,081
Jessie!

281
00:23:51,917 --> 00:23:54,660
Jessie! How can this happen?

282
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:56,574
Alberto Lazzari!

283
00:23:59,375 --> 00:24:01,913
Jessie, I don't want to get upset.

284
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,332
Jessie, cut it out!

285
00:24:05,625 --> 00:24:06,866
Let go!

286
00:24:07,625 --> 00:24:10,823
Don't make me lose my temper.
Come back inside.

287
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,036
Give me the keys.

288
00:24:12,208 --> 00:24:16,452
- Go inside. Don't be stupid.
- Don't you touch me, you pig!

289
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:22,698
Move over. Let me in.
Where are you going? Where?

290
00:24:22,958 --> 00:24:25,450
- Do I get the keys or not?
- No!

291
00:24:26,667 --> 00:24:30,456
- You're not getting out!
- You're hurting me. Let go!

292
00:24:34,417 --> 00:24:36,124
Listen, dear...

293
00:24:37,167 --> 00:24:38,283
Listen one last time.

294
00:24:38,458 --> 00:24:41,826
- There's no more to say.
- I'm tired. You're exhausting!

295
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,663
- Let go! You're ruining my fur.
- I bought it!

296
00:24:44,833 --> 00:24:45,869
You louse!

297
00:24:46,208 --> 00:24:47,870
- Wait a second...
- What for?

298
00:24:48,917 --> 00:24:49,998
You can go.

299
00:24:50,458 --> 00:24:52,040
Lousy second-rate ham!

300
00:24:56,458 --> 00:24:59,872
Listen, Jessie. If you don't
come back, it's over!

301
00:25:00,167 --> 00:25:01,624
Fine! It's over!

302
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:05,289
Finished!
At last! So much the better.

303
00:25:05,583 --> 00:25:07,575
Thanks, thanks, Jessie.

304
00:25:09,083 --> 00:25:10,745
What do you want?
Go away!

305
00:25:36,458 --> 00:25:38,040
I'm talking to you!

306
00:25:41,625 --> 00:25:42,661
Get in.

307
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:44,369
Who, me?

308
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,366
Yes, you. Hurry. Get in.

309
00:25:58,792 --> 00:25:59,873
Fast!

310
00:26:05,583 --> 00:26:06,699
Close the door.

311
00:26:39,333 --> 00:26:40,333
Get out.

312
00:26:40,542 --> 00:26:41,542
But why?

313
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:43,244
Come on, get out.

314
00:26:48,542 --> 00:26:50,704
What's it gonna be, Mr. Mustache?

315
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:53,868
What's going on here?
Get out, get in, get in, get out!

316
00:26:54,042 --> 00:26:55,283
Make up your mind!

317
00:26:56,917 --> 00:26:59,989
Come on. Let's have some fun.

318
00:27:26,458 --> 00:27:29,121
- He said to go in.
- So go in.

319
00:27:55,458 --> 00:27:57,871
How are you, Sir?
How about a table?

320
00:27:58,042 --> 00:28:00,125
Tonight's show is exceptional.

321
00:28:01,417 --> 00:28:03,124
Your umbrella, Signora?

322
00:28:11,542 --> 00:28:13,534
Right this way, Signora.

323
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:31,908
Who's that?

324
00:28:35,333 --> 00:28:36,699
May I help you?

325
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,208
Sit over here. Come on.

326
00:28:41,792 --> 00:28:42,999
Please...

327
00:28:49,333 --> 00:28:50,540
Sit over there.

328
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,208
Alberto!
Monica...

329
00:29:37,917 --> 00:29:40,785
What are you up to, Alberto?
Are you shooting?

330
00:29:40,958 --> 00:29:42,745
- Yes.
- No need to introduce him!

331
00:29:42,917 --> 00:29:44,579
Pleased to meet you.

332
00:29:44,875 --> 00:29:47,618
Yesterday the Americans
gave me a screen test.

333
00:29:47,875 --> 00:29:49,491
It turned out fantastic!

334
00:29:49,667 --> 00:29:53,786
I have a 16 millimeter print at home
if you want to see it.

335
00:30:06,583 --> 00:30:11,157
Ladies and gentlemen, that was
part one of our show. Before you dance

336
00:30:11,333 --> 00:30:14,576
I'd like to salute and applaud
an illustrious guest who is

337
00:30:14,958 --> 00:30:16,158
honoring us with his presence.

338
00:30:16,875 --> 00:30:19,162
Must I applaud too, Alberto?

339
00:30:20,958 --> 00:30:23,325
O.K., boys! Mambo number 26!

340
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:31,742
Do me a favor,
come to our table.

341
00:30:31,917 --> 00:30:34,534
A bunch of my friends
would love to meet you.

342
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:36,700
- Come on, Alberto.
- I can't.

343
00:30:38,333 --> 00:30:39,414
I'm with the lady.

344
00:30:40,833 --> 00:30:41,949
Let's dance.

345
00:31:03,583 --> 00:31:07,702
Mambo... the world turns
around the mambo.

346
00:31:07,875 --> 00:31:09,286
What a mambo.

347
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:51,413
Oh, boy! What a mambo!

348
00:31:58,542 --> 00:32:02,206
If you wanna be with your friends,
don't mind me.

349
00:32:03,833 --> 00:32:04,833
What?

350
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,957
You can go with your friends.

351
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:08,787
That's enough. Let's go.

352
00:32:09,667 --> 00:32:11,124
Good night, Commendatore.

353
00:32:31,958 --> 00:32:33,415
Get in. Hurry up!

354
00:32:35,875 --> 00:32:37,457
- Did you eat?
- No.

355
00:32:37,625 --> 00:32:39,332
Well, a little bit at 8 p.m.

356
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:42,038
- Let's get some supper.
- What?

357
00:32:42,208 --> 00:32:43,494
Let's have supper.

358
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:46,958
Good. Where are we going?

359
00:32:47,125 --> 00:32:48,411
Home.

360
00:32:50,333 --> 00:32:52,666
Wait! Wait a second!
Hey, Fancy Pants!

361
00:32:53,333 --> 00:32:54,995
I'm talking to you!

362
00:32:55,708 --> 00:32:57,040
Look at me!

363
00:32:59,083 --> 00:33:03,202
Look who I'm with!
Up yours! Know who this is?

364
00:33:36,542 --> 00:33:39,205
- Did anyone call?
- Nobody, Commendatore.

365
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:43,038
- What do you mean nobody?
- Nobody called.

366
00:33:43,208 --> 00:33:47,031
- Were you awake or sleeping?
- Nobody called. I was here.

367
00:33:47,208 --> 00:33:48,208
All right.

368
00:33:48,375 --> 00:33:50,412
Supper for two in my room.

369
00:33:51,042 --> 00:33:55,286
If Miss Jessie calls, I'm asleep.
If she insists, I'm asleep.

370
00:33:55,458 --> 00:33:58,371
If she still insists,
I'm still asleep!

371
00:34:00,917 --> 00:34:03,375
We'll eat upstairs.
What's your name?

372
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:05,917
What?

373
00:34:07,417 --> 00:34:09,579
Come on, move.

374
00:34:27,583 --> 00:34:29,575
What? Another dog?

375
00:34:42,583 --> 00:34:44,245
Look at these!

376
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:51,412
You got fish, too?

377
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:55,618
Yes...
Now, where did I put it?

378
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,788
- Leave it for the maid.
- But it'll get wrinkled.

379
00:35:06,375 --> 00:35:08,207
Idiot! What made me do it?

380
00:35:09,167 --> 00:35:12,615
Did you ever see an idiot?
Well, you're looking at one.

381
00:35:12,792 --> 00:35:14,454
Just leave it!

382
00:35:36,792 --> 00:35:37,953
Come.

383
00:35:50,833 --> 00:35:52,290
Your name again?

384
00:35:59,292 --> 00:36:00,578
Where are you from?

385
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:01,750
What?

386
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,698
- Where do you come from?
- From Rome. Piazza Risorgimento.

387
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:11,746
Sit down. You're making me
nervous.

388
00:36:29,125 --> 00:36:30,125
You like it?

389
00:36:32,083 --> 00:36:35,622
Kind of... it's not really my thing.

390
00:36:36,542 --> 00:36:38,829
It's not my taste... but, yes.

391
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,912
Beethoven's Fifth.

392
00:36:44,083 --> 00:36:45,415
I love it.

393
00:36:47,917 --> 00:36:49,283
Come in.

394
00:37:01,125 --> 00:37:02,286
Leave it there.

395
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:04,832
I'll do it. Go.

396
00:37:05,083 --> 00:37:06,324
And close the door.

397
00:37:15,958 --> 00:37:18,325
Let's see what he brought us.

398
00:37:20,125 --> 00:37:21,536
Caviar... lobster...

399
00:37:22,958 --> 00:37:25,621
Help yourself. Eat.
I'm not in the mood.

400
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:29,709
Help yourself.
I don't know if you like it.

401
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,241
1949.

402
00:37:34,792 --> 00:37:36,749
1949...

403
00:37:39,708 --> 00:37:42,121
Take that off.
It's hot in here.

404
00:37:51,667 --> 00:37:53,124
Guess I tore it.

405
00:37:55,917 --> 00:37:58,330
- Where do you live?
- Past the gas station.

406
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,787
- Where?
- On the road to Ostia.

407
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,958
- You come to Via Veneto?
- Via Veneto? Me?

408
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:07,868
I work the Passeggiata
Archeologica. Much more convenient.

409
00:38:08,042 --> 00:38:08,958
Why?

410
00:38:08,959 --> 00:38:11,325
I'm on the Cilia.
Subway takes me right there.

411
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,617
There's another girl,
my friend Wanda.

412
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:17,581
She lives there, too.
But I don't bother with the others.

413
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:20,709
The others sleep under the arches
in Caracalla.

414
00:38:20,875 --> 00:38:23,709
Mind you, I have my own house

415
00:38:23,875 --> 00:38:27,915
with water, electric, bottled gas...
I got every thing.

416
00:38:28,083 --> 00:38:29,870
Even a thermometer.

417
00:38:30,542 --> 00:38:35,242
See this one here?
She never, ever slept under an arch.

418
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:38,958
Well, maybe once... or twice.

419
00:38:41,833 --> 00:38:46,032
Of course, my house is...
nothing like this.

420
00:38:46,833 --> 00:38:48,119
But I like it.

421
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:57,199
Eat. Eat something.

422
00:39:03,833 --> 00:39:05,074
What's wrong?

423
00:39:05,667 --> 00:39:08,125
Damn it! I know who you are!

424
00:39:08,708 --> 00:39:11,496
I know!
Can I say it?

425
00:39:11,667 --> 00:39:13,033
Can I?

426
00:39:13,208 --> 00:39:17,327
Alberto Lazzari! I knew you
right away! I saw all your movies.

427
00:39:17,708 --> 00:39:20,701
- Very nice!
- Which is your favorite?

428
00:39:20,875 --> 00:39:22,582
Well... the last one

429
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:27,245
in a costume with all that stuff,
then Vittorio Gassman came...

430
00:39:27,417 --> 00:39:29,704
pushed the door open and said:
"Fermi tutti!"

431
00:39:30,083 --> 00:39:31,949
Then it was his daughter.

432
00:39:32,375 --> 00:39:33,582
That wasn't me.

433
00:39:34,125 --> 00:39:35,536
What do you mean?

434
00:39:38,625 --> 00:39:40,161
You're as nice as your house.

435
00:39:43,708 --> 00:39:45,165
Bring the glasses here.

436
00:39:54,167 --> 00:39:56,580
- Champagne.
- Sit down.

437
00:40:27,875 --> 00:40:29,332
What's wrong now?

438
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:32,243
Who's gonna believe this
when I tell 'em?

439
00:40:32,458 --> 00:40:36,122
They already think I'm full of it.

440
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,287
I might not believe it myself
tomorrow.

441
00:40:39,458 --> 00:40:42,201
You have to do me a favor.
Give me a picture

442
00:40:42,375 --> 00:40:46,540
and write: "Cabiria was here
at my house. Alberto Lazzari"

443
00:40:46,708 --> 00:40:49,780
"Cabiria Ceccarelli
was at my house."

444
00:40:49,958 --> 00:40:50,994
Like that.

445
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:54,616
Now let's eat.

446
00:40:54,792 --> 00:40:56,283
And you eat, too.

447
00:40:56,833 --> 00:40:58,415
An olive.

448
00:41:00,917 --> 00:41:02,124
Should I open it?

449
00:41:03,458 --> 00:41:07,748
Chicken! Some chicken breast
to chase away the blues.

450
00:41:08,708 --> 00:41:10,825
Here's your plate.

451
00:41:11,167 --> 00:41:15,161
If you want to play more
of that music, I'd like it, too.

452
00:41:15,625 --> 00:41:18,743
And what's this?
I saw it in a movie once.

453
00:41:21,708 --> 00:41:23,324
- Commendatore.
- Yes, Davide.

454
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:25,868
- It's Signorina Jessie.
- Tell her I'm sleeping.

455
00:41:26,042 --> 00:41:27,158
- She's here.
- What?

456
00:41:27,333 --> 00:41:29,996
- She's downstairs.
- Just don't let her in.

457
00:41:30,167 --> 00:41:32,534
She's already in. She's coming up.

458
00:41:32,708 --> 00:41:33,994
Idiot!

459
00:41:45,542 --> 00:41:46,999
Alberto, open up.

460
00:41:47,417 --> 00:41:49,955
- Who is it?
- Don't be stupid! Open up!

461
00:41:50,375 --> 00:41:53,118
So? Open up.

462
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:55,250
It's important.

463
00:41:55,917 --> 00:41:57,124
One moment.

464
00:42:02,042 --> 00:42:04,955
- The picture!
- Oh, yes. Hurry up!

465
00:42:05,625 --> 00:42:07,833
Alberto, will you open up?

466
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:09,832
Go in the bathroom a minute.

467
00:42:10,125 --> 00:42:12,162
Yes. I'll get rid of her... Hurry!

468
00:42:12,333 --> 00:42:14,916
I'm not leaving.
I'll stay here all night!

469
00:42:15,083 --> 00:42:17,917
- Quiet, don't move.
- Open up.

470
00:42:19,042 --> 00:42:21,500
Alberto, please open the door.

471
00:42:25,542 --> 00:42:27,158
Open up, you bastard!

472
00:42:29,708 --> 00:42:30,708
What do you want?

473
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,992
What's on your mind?

474
00:42:45,958 --> 00:42:48,541
I'm tired.
I have to be up early tomorrow.

475
00:42:48,667 --> 00:42:50,704
I'm working. You know that.

476
00:42:51,208 --> 00:42:53,621
I'm thirsty. Give me a drink.

477
00:42:53,792 --> 00:42:56,159
- What?
- I'm thirsty.

478
00:43:01,333 --> 00:43:03,416
Now what?

479
00:43:05,125 --> 00:43:07,082
I can't go on this way!

480
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:09,867
Well, neither can I!

481
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:13,584
Your jealousy
is morbid, unbearable.

482
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:16,493
I'm tired of it.
I can't take it any more.

483
00:43:16,667 --> 00:43:20,240
Let's call it quits
while we're still friends.

484
00:43:21,458 --> 00:43:24,451
That's too easy.
I'm not going anywhere!

485
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:29,119
Jessie, don't do this.
Get some sleep.

486
00:43:30,458 --> 00:43:32,415
You're tired and
I'm falling apart.

487
00:43:32,583 --> 00:43:34,791
We'll call each other tomorrow.

488
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,993
- I know you've stopped loving me.
- Who told you?

489
00:43:58,167 --> 00:44:00,079
You've stopped loving me.

490
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:03,038
- Admit it.
- I'd never say such a thing.

491
00:44:03,208 --> 00:44:06,497
Admit it, and I'll never
bother you again.

492
00:44:06,667 --> 00:44:08,283
But I'd be lying.

493
00:44:08,708 --> 00:44:11,542
Even if we saw each other
occasionally...

494
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,072
Every two or three days,
I'd be happy.

495
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:19,790
Why so seldom?
We could be together much more.

496
00:44:19,958 --> 00:44:22,666
- Every day?
- Yes, every day.

497
00:44:22,833 --> 00:44:27,658
But stop being so jealous. Is it my
fault that women always look at me?

498
00:44:27,833 --> 00:44:29,244
But you're ugly!

499
00:46:38,625 --> 00:46:40,912
How do I get outta here?

500
00:47:07,542 --> 00:47:11,331
Hey, Cabiria. Alberto Lazzari's
been lookin' for you!

501
00:47:11,583 --> 00:47:13,950
I'm not even talking to you!

502
00:47:14,125 --> 00:47:16,367
- Don't listen to her.
- Who's listening?

503
00:47:16,542 --> 00:47:18,204
Hey, Cabiria, there's Limpy.

504
00:47:18,375 --> 00:47:20,037
There's a winner.

505
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:23,163
Hey, you old lecher!

506
00:47:23,833 --> 00:47:26,667
Homesick for jail?

507
00:47:27,167 --> 00:47:29,284
Come on, Cabiria,
let's have a good laugh.

508
00:47:34,625 --> 00:47:37,914
Why'd you bring him along?
A weed never dies!

509
00:47:38,083 --> 00:47:40,166
The Madonna might
have mercy on my uncle.

510
00:47:40,417 --> 00:47:41,375
What mercy?

511
00:47:41,376 --> 00:47:44,414
The pilgrims of the Madonna del
Divino Amore just went by.

512
00:47:44,583 --> 00:47:46,245
I don't believe that stuff.

513
00:47:46,375 --> 00:47:49,118
- Don't you believe in miracles?
- Not me.

514
00:47:49,292 --> 00:47:51,454
Should we go there on Sunday?

515
00:47:51,625 --> 00:47:53,912
We'll all have
something to ask.

516
00:47:54,667 --> 00:47:57,330
Cabiria, you goin' too?

517
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:00,664
Me? I dunno.
I'll think about it. Besides,

518
00:48:00,833 --> 00:48:03,120
what would I ask for?
I've got everything.

519
00:48:03,292 --> 00:48:06,160
I'll even be done
with the mortgage soon.

520
00:48:06,333 --> 00:48:10,156
But I might go anyway.
I haven't said no.

521
00:48:11,375 --> 00:48:12,616
We'll see.

522
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:16,538
Think the Madonna would
waste a miracle on him?

523
00:48:16,917 --> 00:48:20,365
Funny, huh? She knows
how you made your dough.

524
00:48:20,542 --> 00:48:23,034
Selling coke
and pimping women.

525
00:48:23,208 --> 00:48:25,541
I'm going to see the Madonna

526
00:48:25,708 --> 00:48:28,075
and I know exactly
what I'll ask for.

527
00:48:28,667 --> 00:48:31,034
Don't make fun of stuff like that.

528
00:48:33,292 --> 00:48:34,999
You really want to go?

529
00:48:39,375 --> 00:48:40,991
What'll you ask for?

530
00:48:41,667 --> 00:48:44,125
I'm talking to you.
What'll you ask for?

531
00:49:53,833 --> 00:49:55,324
Hey, you! Shorty!

532
00:49:58,208 --> 00:49:59,744
Wanna lift?

533
00:50:22,583 --> 00:50:26,327
A shortcut...
He calls this a shortcut.

534
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:28,787
I've been walking an hour.

535
00:50:29,375 --> 00:50:31,082
Who knows where I am?

536
00:51:16,583 --> 00:51:18,575
You live in the caves, too?

537
00:51:20,042 --> 00:51:21,249
I've never seen you before.

538
00:51:21,417 --> 00:51:22,749
I've got my own house.

539
00:51:39,208 --> 00:51:43,202
Gorgiano! Gorgiano!
It's me. Come up.

540
00:51:49,167 --> 00:51:50,248
How are you doing?

541
00:51:50,417 --> 00:51:52,704
Not so bad, thank you, sir.

542
00:51:54,292 --> 00:51:56,454
And where's Pietro?
Sleeping?

543
00:51:56,958 --> 00:52:00,122
They took him to the hospital
two days ago.

544
00:52:00,292 --> 00:52:02,454
Said he was in bad shape.

545
00:52:03,417 --> 00:52:06,410
- What do you need?
- Whatever you want, sir.

546
00:52:06,583 --> 00:52:09,326
Here's a blanket. Is that alright?

547
00:52:09,542 --> 00:52:11,329
What hospital
did they take Pietro to?

548
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:13,583
To the Fratebenefratelli.

549
00:52:13,750 --> 00:52:16,993
Alright, I'll visit him
if I have time.

550
00:52:29,625 --> 00:52:33,073
Hey, Dark Hair...
who is that guy?

551
00:52:39,083 --> 00:52:41,450
But who is he?
With some charity?

552
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:45,116
Hey, I'm talkin' to you.

553
00:52:58,208 --> 00:52:59,494
Can I help you?

554
00:53:01,708 --> 00:53:03,574
Going back to Rome later?

555
00:53:06,917 --> 00:53:09,125
Can you give me a lift?

556
00:53:10,583 --> 00:53:11,744
Yes, later.

557
00:53:23,417 --> 00:53:24,417
Elsa!

558
00:53:28,917 --> 00:53:30,874
Ah, caro!

559
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:35,369
I was expecting you Saturday,
but you came today!

560
00:53:35,542 --> 00:53:40,833
I was just thinking yesterday,
"He comes every 9 or 10 days...

561
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:44,414
"He came Wednesday,
so he'll show up Saturday!"

562
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,493
Bomba! But I know this one!

563
00:53:50,250 --> 00:53:52,082
But Bomba... You live here?

564
00:53:53,042 --> 00:53:56,535
I wish I had everything I used to...

565
00:53:56,708 --> 00:53:59,667
A place in Rome, a place in Ostia...

566
00:53:59,833 --> 00:54:02,905
Showered with gifts!
Money in the bank!

567
00:54:03,083 --> 00:54:04,415
Jewels! Gold!

568
00:54:04,583 --> 00:54:06,575
I had five kilos of gold!

569
00:54:06,750 --> 00:54:10,699
She's not lying, you know.
Now who'd believe it?

570
00:54:10,875 --> 00:54:12,741
But this one in her day...

571
00:54:12,917 --> 00:54:15,955
Here they don't even
make me comb my hair.

572
00:54:16,125 --> 00:54:19,243
But if I wear a low-cut blouse

573
00:54:19,417 --> 00:54:21,909
and the white earrings, then... ha!

574
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,787
Come, Elsa. Take this.

575
00:54:25,542 --> 00:54:28,250
Oh! Look at the sweets you
brought!

576
00:54:28,417 --> 00:54:31,000
And only for me!
None for the others!

577
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:33,875
Give it to me to hide.

578
00:54:34,042 --> 00:54:36,159
The one with the chocolate!

579
00:54:36,333 --> 00:54:41,249
Pignoli! Look at the pignoli!
Like rainfall!

580
00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:45,243
Caro! Thank you, thank you!

581
00:54:50,042 --> 00:54:52,250
When will you be back?
When?

582
00:54:56,625 --> 00:55:00,039
God protect you from evil, my son.

583
00:55:10,125 --> 00:55:11,707
Of course...

584
00:55:12,542 --> 00:55:15,376
Lots of starving people in Rome,
eh?

585
00:55:21,458 --> 00:55:23,415
You drive around at night a lot.

586
00:55:25,375 --> 00:55:27,332
Not as much as needed.

587
00:55:35,292 --> 00:55:36,624
How 'bout during the day?

588
00:55:37,458 --> 00:55:41,031
No, in the daytime,
the poor wander about.

589
00:55:41,208 --> 00:55:42,995
How would I find them?

590
00:55:44,583 --> 00:55:46,370
Go figure...

591
00:55:47,708 --> 00:55:51,406
Me, I'm out at night, too,
and I've never met you.

592
00:55:53,375 --> 00:55:54,375
But how'd you get

593
00:55:55,917 --> 00:55:57,874
the idea of doing this job?

594
00:55:58,042 --> 00:56:02,036
I don't even know myself.
Like that. Little by little.

595
00:56:05,917 --> 00:56:09,365
We're here... There's your tram.

596
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:20,241
Do you live far from here?

597
00:56:20,417 --> 00:56:23,706
About 19 km, on the road to Ostia.

598
00:56:25,083 --> 00:56:26,870
What's your name?

599
00:56:27,042 --> 00:56:28,783
Maria Ceccarelli.

600
00:56:29,875 --> 00:56:31,207
Are you alone?

601
00:56:32,292 --> 00:56:34,875
My father and mother
died when I was little.

602
00:56:35,042 --> 00:56:36,999
I came to Rome later.

603
00:56:40,042 --> 00:56:43,001
Now go and get some sleep.

604
00:56:58,042 --> 00:56:59,453
So I...

605
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:03,455
Arrivederci...
Go ahead, tell me.

606
00:57:04,042 --> 00:57:06,830
Thank you.
Thank you for everything.

607
00:57:32,792 --> 00:57:35,705
Don Vincenzo,
the group from Rieti is here.

608
00:57:38,542 --> 00:57:43,913
Get your prickly pears!
Fresh prickly pears!

609
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:53,413
Eat my Indian figs!

610
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,242
Gimme a hand, Maurizio.

611
00:58:12,458 --> 00:58:14,666
Wanda, get a load of this crowd!

612
00:58:14,917 --> 00:58:17,830
<i>Divine Love</i>

613
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:22,119
<i>Grants grace at any time</i>

614
00:58:23,708 --> 00:58:26,667
There's the candle guy.
Come on, Uncle.

615
00:58:27,458 --> 00:58:29,700
Viva Maria! Viva Maria!

616
00:58:34,708 --> 00:58:36,745
How much for the candles?

617
00:58:36,917 --> 00:58:40,410
Take your pick.
I got some for 50, 100, 150...

618
00:58:40,583 --> 00:58:42,165
The biggest you got.

619
00:58:42,333 --> 00:58:43,665
We'll take two each.

620
00:58:43,833 --> 00:58:46,621
Wanda, the candles! Over here!

621
00:58:47,083 --> 00:58:48,290
Are these all right?

622
00:58:48,417 --> 00:58:51,376
I just want one.
Maybe I'll pay you later.

623
00:58:51,542 --> 00:58:53,329
No, I'll pay for them all.

624
00:58:55,083 --> 00:58:58,201
- What'll I do with it now?
- Stupid!

625
00:58:59,542 --> 00:59:00,908
How much altogether?

626
00:59:01,333 --> 00:59:06,158
<i>Lovely Lady</i>

627
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:10,790
<i>Who with gladness
In their hearts</i>

628
00:59:10,958 --> 00:59:14,247
<i>Honor you today</i>

629
00:59:14,417 --> 00:59:18,707
Make way! Sick man here!
Let us through!

630
00:59:21,333 --> 00:59:22,414
Oh, the poor lad.

631
00:59:22,583 --> 00:59:23,619
So young!

632
00:59:24,083 --> 00:59:26,666
We're over here! Wait for us!

633
00:59:26,833 --> 00:59:30,326
We're gonna get photos!

634
00:59:30,958 --> 00:59:34,201
- Come, Cabiria. They're calling us.
- I'm coming.

635
00:59:34,375 --> 00:59:35,375
Where's Wanda?

636
00:59:35,958 --> 00:59:37,950
Wanda, come on!

637
00:59:38,125 --> 00:59:39,332
Marisa!

638
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:48,243
Get lost! With that nose
you want a photo?

639
00:59:48,417 --> 00:59:49,953
How much the picture?

640
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:52,624
Now what do we do?

641
00:59:52,792 --> 00:59:56,206
You need to confess. Down
there, where it says "confessione".

642
00:59:56,375 --> 00:59:58,367
I already confessed yesterday.

643
00:59:58,542 --> 01:00:00,204
Watch out! He's a cripple!

644
01:00:03,625 --> 01:00:08,325
- Long live the Madonna del Divino Amore!
- Long live the Madonna del Divino Amore!

645
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:11,914
- Thank you, Holy Virgin!
- Thank you, Holy Virgin!

646
01:00:18,542 --> 01:00:25,369
<i>Ave, Ave</i>

647
01:00:26,208 --> 01:00:27,540
- Wanda...
- Yes?

648
01:00:28,167 --> 01:00:31,956
I'm gonna ask for mercy from
the Madonna, too. Like you.

649
01:00:32,083 --> 01:00:33,665
What am I asking for?

650
01:00:34,083 --> 01:00:35,665
You don't remember?

651
01:00:35,833 --> 01:00:38,166
I could ask for a villa
in Peripli.

652
01:00:38,750 --> 01:00:42,414
That's not what you said!

653
01:00:43,083 --> 01:00:44,199
Don't you remember?

654
01:00:44,375 --> 01:00:47,083
I'll ask for whatever I feel like.

655
01:00:49,042 --> 01:00:51,079
But you said you'd ask...

656
01:00:51,250 --> 01:00:53,162
I changed my mind.

657
01:01:00,958 --> 01:01:02,824
Why are you talking like that?

658
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,242
See? You made
my candle go out.

659
01:01:07,583 --> 01:01:10,997
30 masses at 1,000 each.
That's 30,000.

660
01:01:11,167 --> 01:01:12,248
I gave them thirty-five.

661
01:01:12,417 --> 01:01:14,955
Yeah, you did O.K.
You never know...

662
01:01:15,292 --> 01:01:18,956
- Thank you. Thank you very much.
- Careful not to get burnt.

663
01:01:22,833 --> 01:01:24,324
I forgot
the act of contrition.

664
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:27,208
"My Lord, I repent
with all my heart..."

665
01:01:27,375 --> 01:01:29,913
- And after?
- It's written in the confessional.

666
01:01:30,083 --> 01:01:33,781
Wait here.
We can't go in together!

667
01:01:34,083 --> 01:01:35,619
That's enough for now!

668
01:01:35,917 --> 01:01:39,365
Use the other entrance!

669
01:01:39,542 --> 01:01:41,579
Watch your hands!

670
01:01:44,667 --> 01:01:47,159
Take it easy. Don't push!

671
01:01:47,333 --> 01:01:49,495
I'm sick. I can't help it.

672
01:01:49,958 --> 01:01:52,075
He's sick, too. Can't you see that?

673
01:01:55,250 --> 01:01:56,957
Careful, Uncle.

674
01:01:59,625 --> 01:02:01,867
- There's the altar, Uncle.
- I can't...

675
01:02:02,333 --> 01:02:05,246
I can't go on. I can't move.

676
01:02:05,417 --> 01:02:07,875
I'll hold you 'til
we're at the altar.

677
01:02:08,042 --> 01:02:09,453
I gotta rest.

678
01:02:09,625 --> 01:02:12,242
Rosie, come here.
I think he's gonna pass out.

679
01:02:12,417 --> 01:02:15,000
Try again, Uncle.
We're almost there.

680
01:02:17,625 --> 01:02:19,912
Everyone has a secret agony.

681
01:02:20,250 --> 01:02:22,833
Everyone has a wish
for You to fulfill.

682
01:02:23,042 --> 01:02:26,490
Open your heart to the suffering,
Oh, Holy Virgin!

683
01:02:26,833 --> 01:02:29,246
Mercy, Madonna!

684
01:02:29,583 --> 01:02:31,415
Mercy, Madonna!

685
01:02:31,542 --> 01:02:34,660
Call out with all your hearts,
"Viva Maria!"

686
01:02:34,833 --> 01:02:37,701
- Viva Maria!
- Viva Maria!

687
01:02:37,833 --> 01:02:41,076
- Mercy, Madonna!
- Mercy, Madonna!

688
01:03:22,625 --> 01:03:25,584
- Viva Maria!
- Viva Maria!

689
01:03:26,667 --> 01:03:29,205
- Mercy, Madonna!
- Mercy, Madonna!

690
01:03:30,125 --> 01:03:31,991
Mercy, Madonna!

691
01:03:32,542 --> 01:03:34,875
Viva Maria!

692
01:03:35,208 --> 01:03:37,245
Mercy, Madonna!

693
01:03:37,417 --> 01:03:41,081
- Heal me, Madonna!
- Make me well, Madonna!

694
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:43,492
Heal me, Madonna!

695
01:03:43,667 --> 01:03:45,909
Make me well, Madonna!

696
01:03:46,083 --> 01:03:48,450
Mercy, Madonna!
I beg you with all my heart!

697
01:03:49,750 --> 01:03:54,040
Mercy, Madonna!
I beg you with all my heart!

698
01:04:00,042 --> 01:04:01,578
Wanda, here!

699
01:04:01,958 --> 01:04:06,407
<i>Who with gladness
In their hearts</i>

700
01:04:06,583 --> 01:04:08,575
Stay close.
What happens next?

701
01:04:08,750 --> 01:04:09,786
I dunno!

702
01:04:09,958 --> 01:04:12,996
You oughta hear my heart beating.
I'm shaking.

703
01:04:13,167 --> 01:04:15,875
I feel so strange, Wanda.

704
01:04:17,708 --> 01:04:20,667
- Viva Maria!
- Viva Maria!

705
01:04:20,833 --> 01:04:23,951
- Mercy, Madonna!
- Mercy, Madonna!

706
01:04:24,208 --> 01:04:26,666
Now all kneel and pray.

707
01:04:26,917 --> 01:04:30,911
and beg our heavenly mother
for forgiveness.

708
01:04:33,250 --> 01:04:36,573
Amleto, will the Madonna
bestow Her grace on me?

709
01:04:37,833 --> 01:04:39,415
I think so.

710
01:04:41,333 --> 01:04:44,167
Now approach the altar
of the Virgin.

711
01:04:44,583 --> 01:04:47,075
Look into Her sweet eyes,

712
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:51,199
and in Her glance each of you

713
01:04:51,333 --> 01:04:55,031
will feel the light of hope
turned on in your heart.

714
01:05:16,167 --> 01:05:18,409
Madonna, help me

715
01:05:18,792 --> 01:05:20,658
to change my life.

716
01:05:22,542 --> 01:05:24,454
Bestow your grace on me, too.

717
01:05:28,458 --> 01:05:30,415
Make me change my life.

718
01:05:31,125 --> 01:05:33,492
- Uncle, now!
- I'm afraid.

719
01:05:33,667 --> 01:05:36,865
Drop the crutches.
She'll have mercy on you.

720
01:05:37,333 --> 01:05:38,824
I'm afraid!

721
01:05:39,792 --> 01:05:41,328
I'm holding you!

722
01:05:41,542 --> 01:05:46,242
Madonna, I'm a sinner,
a worm of the earth.

723
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:50,915
Have mercy on me, Madonna.
Don't leave me!

724
01:06:22,917 --> 01:06:24,704
Lost your tongue?
Have a drink.

725
01:06:24,875 --> 01:06:27,868
Careful, Wanda.
One glass and she's smashed.

726
01:06:28,042 --> 01:06:29,749
What are you doing?

727
01:06:29,875 --> 01:06:32,458
- I'm thinking.
- About what?

728
01:06:32,625 --> 01:06:34,241
- What?
- She's thinking.

729
01:06:34,417 --> 01:06:38,582
Too much thinking
will make your head explode.

730
01:06:40,583 --> 01:06:43,621
Look at those delinquents!
Stop with the damn ball!

731
01:06:43,792 --> 01:06:44,912
They're doing it on purpose!

732
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,536
I'll fix 'em!

733
01:06:49,458 --> 01:06:51,495
Get the ball.

734
01:06:51,667 --> 01:06:52,783
Blondie, the ball!

735
01:06:52,958 --> 01:06:55,792
Come on, we want to play!
Give us the ball!

736
01:06:56,083 --> 01:06:58,666
Next time I'll kick it
the other way!

737
01:07:04,458 --> 01:07:06,199
You wanna stay here by
yourselves?

738
01:07:06,375 --> 01:07:09,368
Uncle and I will leave.
Just say so.

739
01:07:09,542 --> 01:07:12,706
- Why should we want to?
- What's wrong with you?

740
01:07:14,708 --> 01:07:17,325
- What if we wanted to?
- What's wrong?

741
01:07:17,458 --> 01:07:20,075
Hey! Come over here
and get your ball!

742
01:07:20,250 --> 01:07:23,288
Come over here
if you want it!

743
01:07:24,333 --> 01:07:27,201
Go get her.
She can't even walk.

744
01:07:27,375 --> 01:07:30,368
I'm not gonna tangle with her.
She'll manage.

745
01:07:30,542 --> 01:07:33,660
This music's boring!
Let's rock!

746
01:07:33,833 --> 01:07:34,914
Are you nut?

747
01:07:37,875 --> 01:07:40,208
We haven't changed.

748
01:07:41,417 --> 01:07:44,740
Nobody's changed!

749
01:07:45,583 --> 01:07:49,748
We're all the same as before,
just like the cripple.

750
01:07:49,875 --> 01:07:53,323
What do you want to change,
Cabiria?

751
01:07:56,083 --> 01:07:58,291
You think this is the end?

752
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,366
You know what I'm gonna do?

753
01:08:00,542 --> 01:08:05,617
I'm gonna sell the house.
Everything. I'm leaving.

754
01:08:06,125 --> 01:08:10,324
Goodbye, you guys.
I'm through with all this!

755
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:11,581
Where'll you go?

756
01:08:11,750 --> 01:08:14,788
Where? Think I'm like you?

757
01:08:15,125 --> 01:08:18,323
I know where I can go. I know.

758
01:08:19,333 --> 01:08:22,576
Just look at those little nuns!

759
01:08:24,167 --> 01:08:28,116
Where you going with that banner?

760
01:08:28,292 --> 01:08:29,954
Looking for snails?

761
01:08:31,167 --> 01:08:34,456
- Why'd you make her drink?
- I made her drink?

762
01:08:36,750 --> 01:08:40,414
Did the Madonna give you mercy?

763
01:08:40,750 --> 01:08:42,412
Did she?

764
01:08:42,750 --> 01:08:45,618
Cabiria! You wanna get us
arrested?

765
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,957
Amleto, look at her!

766
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:50,125
What?

767
01:08:50,167 --> 01:08:51,125
Bring her back!

768
01:08:51,126 --> 01:08:54,324
Leave me alone!
I wanna listen. Go on playing!

769
01:08:55,708 --> 01:08:59,406
Come have fun with us!

770
01:08:59,875 --> 01:09:04,370
Come dance with us!
Forget about your banner!

771
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:08,323
Forget about it.

772
01:09:08,667 --> 01:09:12,160
- Why do you always butt in?
- Get lost!

773
01:09:13,583 --> 01:09:16,655
Cabiria!
You're in no condition for this!

774
01:09:17,083 --> 01:09:20,155
- Leave me alone.
- You're blind drunk!

775
01:09:20,333 --> 01:09:23,451
Who's drunk?
What do you know?

776
01:10:20,708 --> 01:10:22,119
Is the show any good?

777
01:10:22,875 --> 01:10:24,207
I asked you a question!

778
01:10:24,375 --> 01:10:26,332
Want me to say it stinks?

779
01:10:57,208 --> 01:11:01,077
As you can see, ladies and
gentlemen, my assistant's head

780
01:11:01,208 --> 01:11:05,248
has been completely
impaled by the daggers.

781
01:11:05,417 --> 01:11:09,457
There's no doubt
that his head must be

782
01:11:09,667 --> 01:11:11,329
soaked in blood.

783
01:11:11,625 --> 01:11:16,871
You'll be amazed to see, instead,
that his head has disappeared!

784
01:11:27,250 --> 01:11:29,663
In the second part
of our show, we'll feature

785
01:11:29,833 --> 01:11:32,951
experiments with magnetism,
hypnotism and auto-suggestion.

786
01:11:33,125 --> 01:11:37,165
Would anyone in the audience
care to volunteer? Prego, Signori!

787
01:11:37,292 --> 01:11:39,079
I will!

788
01:11:45,542 --> 01:11:47,955
Come right up.
Don't be afraid.

789
01:11:48,542 --> 01:11:50,909
There's absolutely no danger.

790
01:11:57,625 --> 01:12:01,574
We now need a representative
of the fair sex.

791
01:12:01,750 --> 01:12:04,208
- How about you, Signorina?
- Me?

792
01:12:04,333 --> 01:12:06,620
Yes, you! Come up. Be brave!

793
01:12:07,208 --> 01:12:08,540
I don't want to.

794
01:12:08,708 --> 01:12:11,997
Would you leave those young men
up there all alone?

795
01:12:12,167 --> 01:12:13,374
You go, then!

796
01:12:13,542 --> 01:12:15,750
Come on, chickie!
We need a laugh.

797
01:12:15,917 --> 01:12:17,328
Wanna laugh?

798
01:12:18,833 --> 01:12:20,369
Look at you in the mirror!

799
01:12:20,792 --> 01:12:23,409
Come on, Signorina,
don't make us beg.

800
01:12:23,583 --> 01:12:25,245
Should I come and get you?

801
01:12:25,417 --> 01:12:28,410
I'll come and get you. Beg you.

802
01:12:28,583 --> 01:12:31,701
Don't be afraid.
We're all good friends.

803
01:12:31,833 --> 01:12:32,833
All tricks...

804
01:12:32,875 --> 01:12:35,538
- Will you come?
- Sure! I'm coming.

805
01:12:36,750 --> 01:12:38,833
Think I'm scared?

806
01:12:40,250 --> 01:12:42,116
No reason to be.

807
01:12:42,708 --> 01:12:48,158
There's no reason to be afraid.
You've showed how brave you are.

808
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:52,334
Come, you'll be fine.
Now, let's enjoy ourselves.

809
01:12:52,667 --> 01:12:56,911
Oh, I'm so forgetful!
It's really unforgivable!

810
01:12:57,083 --> 01:13:01,248
I completely forgot that
Signorina Elvira is still inside.

811
01:13:06,583 --> 01:13:08,916
Oh, this heat!
You're hot too, aren't you?

812
01:13:09,083 --> 01:13:12,906
How about a nice boat ride?
Does anybody here get seasick?

813
01:13:13,125 --> 01:13:15,833
I was on the Isle of Elba
as a kid.

814
01:13:16,042 --> 01:13:17,624
You barely got to Ostia.

815
01:13:17,792 --> 01:13:21,991
Nobody here gets seasick?
That's very good.

816
01:13:22,167 --> 01:13:24,033
Ah, here's our boat.

817
01:13:24,208 --> 01:13:27,827
We named her "Intrepid" because
she always defies the waves.

818
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,708
Come on, boys.
Don't make me beg you.

819
01:13:30,875 --> 01:13:32,457
Signorina, you stay here.

820
01:13:32,625 --> 01:13:37,290
The boat is waiting. The sea is
calm, and the weather is fine.

821
01:13:37,958 --> 01:13:39,369
I'm getting out of here!

822
01:13:39,542 --> 01:13:41,078
Where are you going?

823
01:13:42,500 --> 01:13:45,083
Damn, he's good!
He zapped him!

824
01:13:54,125 --> 01:13:55,411
Look into my eyes!

825
01:14:02,583 --> 01:14:03,699
Take the oars.

826
01:14:05,458 --> 01:14:06,574
Row!

827
01:14:11,333 --> 01:14:16,533
The sea is calm, transparent.
Feel the breeze.

828
01:14:16,875 --> 01:14:20,664
Enjoy filling your lungs with air
saturated with salt and iodine.

829
01:14:21,292 --> 01:14:22,292
Dolphins!

830
01:14:24,625 --> 01:14:25,832
Boy, look at 'em jump!

831
01:14:26,250 --> 01:14:27,866
One of you doesn't feel so good.

832
01:14:29,042 --> 01:14:31,204
Things are looking bad, boys.

833
01:14:31,458 --> 01:14:34,622
It's the open sea now.
The waves are swelling.

834
01:14:34,792 --> 01:14:36,408
Hear the wind whistling.

835
01:14:37,458 --> 01:14:38,915
It's a hurricane!

836
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:46,162
Help! Hold the rudder!

837
01:14:48,458 --> 01:14:51,496
It's every man for himself!

838
01:14:59,167 --> 01:15:01,500
Mamma mia bella!
I'm drowning!

839
01:15:16,917 --> 01:15:20,035
- Scared, weren't you?
- You'd have been, too!

840
01:15:20,208 --> 01:15:22,825
You were plenty scared!

841
01:15:24,667 --> 01:15:26,033
Where are you going?

842
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:28,491
- You mean me?
- Yes.

843
01:15:28,667 --> 01:15:29,953
It's not over?

844
01:15:30,083 --> 01:15:33,906
It's not over.
You'd leave me here all alone?

845
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:36,457
What's he want now?

846
01:15:37,083 --> 01:15:38,415
Signora or Signorina?

847
01:15:42,917 --> 01:15:44,158
Did you have fun?

848
01:15:44,458 --> 01:15:45,869
Not really.

849
01:15:46,042 --> 01:15:49,786
I'd like to talk with you
a moment. Come here.

850
01:15:50,542 --> 01:15:52,955
- Are you from Rome?
- I live in Rome.

851
01:15:55,375 --> 01:15:59,745
In what part of town?
Colonna? Parioli? Prati?

852
01:16:00,625 --> 01:16:01,625
In Prati.

853
01:16:03,583 --> 01:16:07,953
Come on, be honest with me.
Where do you live?

854
01:16:08,750 --> 01:16:10,116
In Borgata San Francesco.

855
01:16:18,875 --> 01:16:20,207
What's so funny?

856
01:16:20,625 --> 01:16:23,208
Don't pay any attention.
They're just joking.

857
01:16:23,625 --> 01:16:28,074
So, you're not married,
but you'd like to be.

858
01:16:28,708 --> 01:16:30,665
Why should I get married?

859
01:16:30,792 --> 01:16:33,125
Who'd marry her!

860
01:16:34,042 --> 01:16:35,829
All girls want to get married.

861
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:41,576
I know a nice young man
who'd be happy to marry you.

862
01:16:41,958 --> 01:16:43,165
Me?

863
01:16:43,333 --> 01:16:45,871
He's rich, handsome
and drives a Ferrari.

864
01:16:46,042 --> 01:16:49,206
Let's see if we can arrange it.

865
01:16:49,333 --> 01:16:50,824
What type of work
do you do?

866
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:52,536
She's a countess!

867
01:16:55,917 --> 01:16:59,160
Listen, I'm fine the way I am.
I got everything.

868
01:16:59,792 --> 01:17:01,283
And now I'm leaving.

869
01:17:04,833 --> 01:17:07,291
I don't need anything!
O.K.?

870
01:17:07,625 --> 01:17:09,742
Even better.

871
01:17:09,917 --> 01:17:14,207
So you're rich?
With a bank account, houses...

872
01:17:14,792 --> 01:17:16,829
I own the house I live in. O.K.?

873
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:18,957
And now I'll get going.

874
01:17:20,667 --> 01:17:22,124
One moment!

875
01:17:22,458 --> 01:17:24,324
Don't make me look foolish.

876
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:28,369
At least let me introduce you
to the young man, Oscar.

877
01:17:28,958 --> 01:17:31,075
Who the heck is Oscar?

878
01:17:36,458 --> 01:17:37,699
Please step forward.

879
01:17:41,875 --> 01:17:43,207
How elegant you look.

880
01:17:44,375 --> 01:17:48,073
Come here. I'd like to introduce
you to the Signorina.

881
01:17:49,167 --> 01:17:51,329
She wanted to meet you, too.

882
01:17:54,333 --> 01:17:55,449
A pleasure.

883
01:17:55,625 --> 01:17:58,038
The pleasure is all his,
believe me.

884
01:18:03,833 --> 01:18:07,577
Now that you've met,
I'll leave you two alone.

885
01:18:08,042 --> 01:18:13,037
This is a beautiful garden,
filled with flowers.

886
01:18:13,542 --> 01:18:18,583
You can talk, confide in
each other. No one is listening.

887
01:18:19,125 --> 01:18:21,583
Look, Signorina,
Oscar is offering his arm.

888
01:18:21,750 --> 01:18:26,199
Come, Signorina, take his arm.
There's no harm in that.

889
01:18:26,375 --> 01:18:29,789
But... we just met.

890
01:18:30,500 --> 01:18:33,743
You're strolling among the flowers.

891
01:18:34,042 --> 01:18:37,956
The birds are singing
but Oscar doesn't dare to speak.

892
01:18:38,125 --> 01:18:40,412
He's shy, moved.

893
01:18:40,583 --> 01:18:42,620
Now he says, "Signorina,

894
01:18:42,792 --> 01:18:46,911
"I've been hoping to meet you
for such a long time.

895
01:18:47,625 --> 01:18:49,287
"May I ask you a question?

896
01:18:51,042 --> 01:18:53,534
"You're not spoken for, are you?

897
01:18:54,542 --> 01:18:57,250
"There was never
a man in your life?

898
01:18:59,208 --> 01:19:00,915
"Ah, I thought so.

899
01:19:01,917 --> 01:19:06,833
"I often see you standing by your
window, and at Sunday Mass.

900
01:19:07,125 --> 01:19:11,324
"Your eyes are always lowered.
You're always with your mother.

901
01:19:12,792 --> 01:19:16,661
"That's good. Picking flowers
indicates a gentle soul.

902
01:19:17,750 --> 01:19:21,494
"Signorina, may I hope
to see you again?

903
01:19:24,917 --> 01:19:28,365
"Ah, thank you.
What did you say your name was?

904
01:19:31,125 --> 01:19:35,074
"Thank you. I'll save this flower
like a precious object.

905
01:19:35,250 --> 01:19:36,991
"Would you dance with me?"

906
01:19:37,167 --> 01:19:40,410
Play, Maestro.
Oscar and Maria wish to dance.

907
01:19:41,417 --> 01:19:44,251
The orchestra will play
a beautiful waltz.

908
01:19:50,792 --> 01:19:53,375
"I'm wealthy
but I'm alone and unhappy.

909
01:19:53,542 --> 01:19:57,331
"What good are fancy cars,
long journeys and luxury hotels?

910
01:19:57,500 --> 01:19:59,207
"Smoke! Illusion!

911
01:19:59,417 --> 01:20:04,162
"What I really want is a home,
children, and a wife like you."

912
01:20:05,375 --> 01:20:09,540
When I was eighteen, that's when
you should have known me.

913
01:20:10,125 --> 01:20:13,789
I had long black hair...
This long.

914
01:20:14,167 --> 01:20:17,080
"For me, you'll always be eighteen."

915
01:20:20,125 --> 01:20:21,536
Then it's true?

916
01:20:21,667 --> 01:20:22,908
You love me?

917
01:20:24,042 --> 01:20:27,740
Is it really true?
You're not trying to fool me?

918
01:20:28,292 --> 01:20:30,124
Do you really love me?

919
01:20:43,125 --> 01:20:45,492
There, there. It's all right.

920
01:20:59,958 --> 01:21:01,165
What happened?

921
01:21:02,083 --> 01:21:04,245
What did you make me do?

922
01:21:15,375 --> 01:21:16,957
I have to close up.

923
01:21:17,125 --> 01:21:18,616
I'm going!

924
01:21:20,583 --> 01:21:23,826
Listen, are those creeps
still out there?

925
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,367
Everybody's gone.
There's nobody left.

926
01:21:28,708 --> 01:21:30,791
Get going.
I gotta close up.

927
01:21:31,208 --> 01:21:33,291
I'll show them a thing or two!

928
01:21:36,625 --> 01:21:38,116
Pardon me, Signorina.

929
01:21:38,958 --> 01:21:40,574
I'm Donofrio, accountant.

930
01:21:42,542 --> 01:21:44,408
Forgive my boldness.

931
01:21:45,500 --> 01:21:48,698
I don't normally
stop young ladies in the street.

932
01:21:48,875 --> 01:21:50,707
I was among the audience.

933
01:21:50,875 --> 01:21:52,992
Oh! You were there, watching!

934
01:21:53,167 --> 01:21:55,784
Great show!
I bet you liked it!

935
01:21:56,083 --> 01:21:59,076
If I ever see that slime-ball again...

936
01:21:59,500 --> 01:22:03,414
Signorina!
Please don't misunderstand me.

937
01:22:03,583 --> 01:22:05,290
I agree with you.

938
01:22:06,125 --> 01:22:08,367
In fact, I sympathize with you.

939
01:22:08,917 --> 01:22:12,831
I came to tell you
how moved I was.

940
01:22:14,750 --> 01:22:18,994
We can all pretend to be
cynical and scheming.

941
01:22:20,250 --> 01:22:25,700
But when we're faced with...
purity and innocence

942
01:22:26,333 --> 01:22:28,700
the cynical mask drops off

943
01:22:29,667 --> 01:22:32,501
and all that is best in us
awakens.

944
01:22:36,875 --> 01:22:39,538
I wanted to thank you.
You did me good.

945
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:44,992
It's gotten chilly, hasn't it?

946
01:22:46,625 --> 01:22:49,868
May I? Excuse me.
It's the night-time humidity.

947
01:22:52,542 --> 01:22:54,249
May I buy you something?

948
01:22:54,458 --> 01:22:57,201
But... I really don't know you.

949
01:23:01,667 --> 01:23:04,580
Those damn creeps
are still there!

950
01:23:06,500 --> 01:23:09,789
Excuse my persistence,
but these experiments with magnetism

951
01:23:09,958 --> 01:23:12,120
are extremely dangerous.

952
01:23:12,542 --> 01:23:16,081
They can cause imbalances
and other disturbances.

953
01:23:17,875 --> 01:23:20,868
That's why I felt so strange!

954
01:23:21,042 --> 01:23:24,285
Cold, hot, sweaty.
Like I had a fever.

955
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:26,741
How about that!

956
01:23:26,917 --> 01:23:29,876
I would suggest a Fernet.
It'll do you good.

957
01:23:31,292 --> 01:23:32,783
Come and sit down.

958
01:23:33,708 --> 01:23:35,074
Just a moment.

959
01:23:36,625 --> 01:23:37,911
Please sit down.

960
01:23:40,458 --> 01:23:42,040
Two Fernet, please.

961
01:23:49,500 --> 01:23:52,664
I swear, I've rarely suffered
as I did tonight.

962
01:23:53,792 --> 01:23:58,787
When that charlatan spoke words
of love to you in Oscar's name

963
01:23:59,875 --> 01:24:03,915
and you answered
with such modesty and trepidation,

964
01:24:04,292 --> 01:24:08,206
it made me sick.
Something hurt me in here.

965
01:24:08,917 --> 01:24:11,079
I was ill. Really ill.

966
01:24:11,708 --> 01:24:13,324
Hurry up. I'm closing.

967
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,413
Don't be upset.

968
01:24:18,625 --> 01:24:22,744
Some things cannot be touched
by human vulgarity.

969
01:24:25,667 --> 01:24:28,831
Even amidst a crowd
that laughs idiotically,

970
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:32,698
there's always someone
who understands, who knows,

971
01:24:32,958 --> 01:24:34,324
who appreciates.

972
01:24:42,458 --> 01:24:43,915
But what did I do?

973
01:24:45,583 --> 01:24:49,577
You acted out a very tender
and delicate love scene.

974
01:24:50,542 --> 01:24:52,534
I'm still deeply touched.

975
01:24:52,875 --> 01:24:54,491
I can't even express it.

976
01:24:56,583 --> 01:25:00,406
Yes... what struck me most

977
01:25:01,333 --> 01:25:05,247
is that deep inside,
you're as pure as you were at 18.

978
01:25:06,083 --> 01:25:08,416
When you went to Mass
with your mother

979
01:25:09,375 --> 01:25:12,618
and had long black hair,
falling down to here.

980
01:25:14,500 --> 01:25:16,457
I really said that?

981
01:25:18,042 --> 01:25:19,042
Closing time.

982
01:25:20,125 --> 01:25:22,742
- How much?
- 150 lire.

983
01:25:26,375 --> 01:25:29,413
Thank you...
Hey, you, go sleep at home!

984
01:25:29,583 --> 01:25:31,324
Listen, Signorina...

985
01:25:31,792 --> 01:25:34,910
What happened tonight
is extremely important to me.

986
01:25:36,542 --> 01:25:38,204
Just imagine...

987
01:25:38,750 --> 01:25:42,664
I'm not from around here,
I just came here by chance.

988
01:25:43,250 --> 01:25:48,120
I enjoy strolling in the city
in sections that I don't know.

989
01:25:48,500 --> 01:25:51,948
I went into that music hall,
without knowing why.

990
01:25:52,167 --> 01:25:56,832
There's no explanation for what
happened. As if guided by fate.

991
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:58,832
Yes, that's the word: fate!

992
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:00,662
But who are you?

993
01:26:01,042 --> 01:26:02,999
You sound like you're from Parioli.

994
01:26:03,167 --> 01:26:04,374
What do you mean?

995
01:26:04,583 --> 01:26:07,496
You talk like they them.
A refined type.

996
01:26:08,583 --> 01:26:13,078
I told you my name is Donofrio.
I'm a government employee.

997
01:26:13,500 --> 01:26:15,207
What do you want from me?

998
01:26:17,417 --> 01:26:21,582
You might understand me better
after I tell you my first name.

999
01:26:22,958 --> 01:26:23,958
Oscar.

1000
01:26:24,542 --> 01:26:25,542
I'm Oscar.

1001
01:26:25,708 --> 01:26:27,825
- Your name's Oscar?
- Yes.

1002
01:26:28,958 --> 01:26:32,781
So what? Your being Oscar
could be a coincidence, no?

1003
01:26:34,250 --> 01:26:38,915
Sure. But isn't it strange that the
hypnotist chose the name Oscar?

1004
01:26:40,042 --> 01:26:43,490
Signorina,
I really must see you again.

1005
01:26:44,250 --> 01:26:45,250
You're taking the bus?

1006
01:26:45,792 --> 01:26:49,365
Yeah. I'm dead tired.
I gotta get to bed.

1007
01:26:49,625 --> 01:26:52,823
Do we say goodbye now,
never to meet again?

1008
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,367
Impossible.
I've got to see you again.

1009
01:26:56,333 --> 01:27:00,828
The city is vast and we still have
so much to say to each other.

1010
01:27:01,583 --> 01:27:04,655
When and where
can we meet again? Please!

1011
01:27:05,083 --> 01:27:09,032
I don't know... I'm busy..I work.

1012
01:27:09,625 --> 01:27:12,993
I'm a salesgirl... Anyway,
what'll we say to each other?

1013
01:27:13,167 --> 01:27:15,329
- What?
- What would we say?

1014
01:27:15,708 --> 01:27:18,075
There's the bus.
So long. Arrivederci.

1015
01:27:18,667 --> 01:27:21,535
Please don't say no.
I work, too.

1016
01:27:21,833 --> 01:27:23,995
Maybe we can meet after work.

1017
01:27:24,167 --> 01:27:28,161
Like tomorrow evening.
Signorina, wait! Tomorrow?

1018
01:27:28,292 --> 01:27:30,955
- The evening, no.
- Sunday afternoon?

1019
01:27:31,125 --> 01:27:33,538
Sunday, the Stazione Termini,
at seven.

1020
01:27:33,708 --> 01:27:35,995
I don't know. I feel so strange...

1021
01:27:39,583 --> 01:27:40,619
What're you doing?

1022
01:27:40,792 --> 01:27:42,249
Hurry. Let's go!

1023
01:28:30,500 --> 01:28:31,616
Here I am!

1024
01:28:33,875 --> 01:28:37,118
I was over there.
Sorry I kept you waiting.

1025
01:28:38,208 --> 01:28:39,699
Thank you for coming here.

1026
01:28:41,333 --> 01:28:45,373
You might have thought me
annoying, out of line.

1027
01:28:45,542 --> 01:28:47,033
It was all so strange...

1028
01:28:48,042 --> 01:28:49,908
As if I were dreaming.

1029
01:28:51,167 --> 01:28:53,204
I took the liberty,
if you'll accept.

1030
01:28:53,375 --> 01:28:56,618
Thanks. You didn't have to.

1031
01:28:56,792 --> 01:28:59,830
My pleasure.
Let's go that way.

1032
01:29:01,583 --> 01:29:06,453
He says he likes to talk to me.
And he talks. Boy! Does he talk!

1033
01:29:06,625 --> 01:29:09,663
The type who reads a lot.
Well-educated.

1034
01:29:10,083 --> 01:29:13,076
Last night we saw
a first-run movie.

1035
01:29:13,250 --> 01:29:14,957
Hey! That's your third!

1036
01:29:15,125 --> 01:29:16,787
I know they're good.

1037
01:29:17,042 --> 01:29:20,740
We went at the Metropolitan.
A costume movie.

1038
01:29:20,875 --> 01:29:23,037
Gladiators, Christian martyrs.

1039
01:29:24,292 --> 01:29:28,286
He explained to me
that it wasn't a true story.

1040
01:29:28,458 --> 01:29:30,871
It's just for the movies,
understand?

1041
01:29:31,042 --> 01:29:33,329
And then, he told me that...

1042
01:29:33,583 --> 01:29:36,906
he gets a kick out
of talking to me because...

1043
01:29:37,083 --> 01:29:39,075
because I understand him.

1044
01:29:39,333 --> 01:29:41,245
He's even good-looking.

1045
01:29:41,417 --> 01:29:45,081
Black eyes, brown skin.
A northern type.

1046
01:29:45,250 --> 01:29:48,869
Then we had pizza at a trattoria.
He always pays.

1047
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:50,662
Even for the flowers.

1048
01:29:51,083 --> 01:29:53,621
- Nothing? He wants nothing?
- 'Course not.

1049
01:29:53,792 --> 01:29:55,909
Do me a favor, Cabi!

1050
01:29:56,083 --> 01:29:58,871
I'll be meeting him again
tomorrow.

1051
01:29:59,042 --> 01:30:00,533
What's he after?

1052
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:03,457
How do I know?

1053
01:30:03,625 --> 01:30:06,743
And who cares?
As long as he pays!

1054
01:30:06,917 --> 01:30:08,283
Oh, sure!

1055
01:30:09,375 --> 01:30:12,368
The cops!

1056
01:30:14,667 --> 01:30:16,909
What you all need is jail!

1057
01:30:17,083 --> 01:30:19,040
Arrest them all!

1058
01:30:19,208 --> 01:30:22,201
I'm not running away.
If you want me, I'm here!

1059
01:30:57,875 --> 01:31:00,709
How are you?
How elegant you look today!

1060
01:31:00,875 --> 01:31:02,537
How are you feeling?

1061
01:31:03,125 --> 01:31:06,914
- Fine, and you?
- Thank you. Here... for you.

1062
01:31:08,042 --> 01:31:10,910
- Thank you. You shouldn't have.
- Don't mention it.

1063
01:31:11,083 --> 01:31:12,790
- It's too much.
- Take it.

1064
01:31:13,875 --> 01:31:15,332
Where shall we go?

1065
01:31:15,708 --> 01:31:17,370
Wherever you want.

1066
01:31:17,708 --> 01:31:18,915
Sunny day.

1067
01:31:19,875 --> 01:31:21,582
Let's go to the Aventino.

1068
01:31:28,250 --> 01:31:30,162
Your family's not from Rome?

1069
01:31:30,375 --> 01:31:32,241
No. I have no family left.

1070
01:31:32,417 --> 01:31:35,080
My mother and father
died when I was a child.

1071
01:31:35,542 --> 01:31:38,125
Loneliness is a heavy burden,
but I'd rather be alone

1072
01:31:38,333 --> 01:31:40,700
than make compromises.

1073
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,367
We lived in Puglia,
in a small village.

1074
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,959
The name is unimportant.
You wouldn't know it.

1075
01:31:49,375 --> 01:31:53,073
I grew up in an old house.
I remember the oil lamps.

1076
01:31:53,667 --> 01:31:57,240
My father owned a small plot
of land. His name was Giovanni.

1077
01:31:59,333 --> 01:32:01,575
My mother's name was Elsa,
the poor soul.

1078
01:32:01,750 --> 01:32:04,037
I like the name Elsa.
It's pretty.

1079
01:32:05,667 --> 01:32:09,035
I had no brothers or sisters.
When my father died

1080
01:32:09,208 --> 01:32:11,495
some ruthless relatives
robbed my mother

1081
01:32:11,667 --> 01:32:14,501
of what little property she had,
leaving us very poor.

1082
01:32:14,708 --> 01:32:16,199
I went looking for work.

1083
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:40,866
What are you doing, my child?

1084
01:33:42,292 --> 01:33:43,408
Good day, Father.

1085
01:33:43,583 --> 01:33:45,165
Some alms for Sant'Antonio?

1086
01:33:45,333 --> 01:33:46,995
Sorry, I've no money on me.

1087
01:33:47,167 --> 01:33:49,534
Never mind. Some other time.

1088
01:33:49,708 --> 01:33:52,451
What's important is
to always be in God's grace.

1089
01:33:52,625 --> 01:33:55,493
You are in God's grace,
aren't you, my child?

1090
01:33:57,125 --> 01:33:58,991
You're not in God's grace?

1091
01:34:02,875 --> 01:34:04,036
Why not?

1092
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:10,957
Everyone should be
in God's grace.

1093
01:34:11,125 --> 01:34:13,458
Whoever lives in God's grace
is happy.

1094
01:34:14,250 --> 01:34:17,789
I'm in God's grace
and I'm happy.

1095
01:34:18,917 --> 01:34:22,160
I even went to the Madonna
to ask for Her grace.

1096
01:34:22,583 --> 01:34:27,283
Maybe you didn't know how to
ask, or maybe you didn't need it.

1097
01:34:27,875 --> 01:34:29,457
Are you married?

1098
01:34:30,208 --> 01:34:33,827
That's bad. Girls should get
married and make children.

1099
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,242
Matrimony is a sacred thing.

1100
01:34:36,583 --> 01:34:40,657
In the grace of God, my child.
Ask Sant'Antonio for help.

1101
01:34:40,833 --> 01:34:44,247
If you need me,
I'm Brother Giovanni.

1102
01:34:46,333 --> 01:34:50,782
I'm at the San Francesco
Monastery, but I'm hard to find.

1103
01:34:51,333 --> 01:34:52,949
I'm always running around.

1104
01:35:13,625 --> 01:35:15,036
Hey, Blondie!

1105
01:35:22,083 --> 01:35:23,619
So long!

1106
01:35:26,292 --> 01:35:27,408
Tomorrow?

1107
01:35:27,583 --> 01:35:28,824
Tomorrow I'm busy.

1108
01:35:29,708 --> 01:35:31,700
Then the day after tomorrow.
Same time.

1109
01:35:31,875 --> 01:35:34,083
I'm busy then, too.

1110
01:35:39,208 --> 01:35:41,040
I was gonna tell you...

1111
01:35:41,208 --> 01:35:43,165
I dunno if I'll keep seeing you.

1112
01:35:43,333 --> 01:35:44,619
But, why?

1113
01:35:48,583 --> 01:35:51,542
It's not that I'm
uncomfortable with you.

1114
01:35:54,167 --> 01:35:55,783
But what's the point?

1115
01:35:56,833 --> 01:35:58,665
What am I doing with you?

1116
01:35:58,833 --> 01:36:00,540
We're both wasting our time.

1117
01:36:01,250 --> 01:36:02,411
And doing what?

1118
01:36:03,583 --> 01:36:06,121
Anyway, what do you
want from me?

1119
01:36:07,458 --> 01:36:11,327
If you want... I'll marry you.

1120
01:36:18,958 --> 01:36:20,870
I wanted to ask you before.

1121
01:36:23,125 --> 01:36:26,323
But I didn't have the courage.
I've wanted to...

1122
01:36:27,917 --> 01:36:30,534
to ask you since
the first time I saw you.

1123
01:36:32,500 --> 01:36:33,661
What are you saying?

1124
01:36:35,208 --> 01:36:36,744
Marry me?

1125
01:36:37,708 --> 01:36:42,032
What are you saying?
Marry someone you saw 10 times?

1126
01:36:42,833 --> 01:36:45,871
That's not how it's done!
Really!

1127
01:36:46,042 --> 01:36:48,705
Thank God I'm an honest woman!

1128
01:36:48,875 --> 01:36:51,583
That's not how it's done.
Excuse-me.

1129
01:36:52,542 --> 01:36:54,408
What do you know about me?

1130
01:36:54,875 --> 01:36:56,286
Who I am?

1131
01:36:58,542 --> 01:37:00,750
You ask me like that?

1132
01:37:01,458 --> 01:37:03,700
I'm no fool!

1133
01:37:04,208 --> 01:37:06,165
And you chose me!

1134
01:37:16,333 --> 01:37:19,906
I've asked you no question.
I don't want to know anything.

1135
01:37:23,875 --> 01:37:25,787
Prejudices don't touch me.

1136
01:37:28,500 --> 01:37:31,413
Because... what matters

1137
01:37:32,417 --> 01:37:34,534
is that I know your inner self.

1138
01:37:35,708 --> 01:37:38,701
We are... we are
two lonely creatures.

1139
01:37:46,167 --> 01:37:49,911
We have to stick together.
I need you.

1140
01:37:52,417 --> 01:37:54,033
Don't tell me that.

1141
01:37:55,583 --> 01:37:57,165
Don't, if it isn't true.

1142
01:37:57,333 --> 01:37:58,449
But it is!

1143
01:38:12,667 --> 01:38:16,581
What did you do?
What is it, you nut?

1144
01:38:16,875 --> 01:38:19,117
I'm getting married!

1145
01:38:19,292 --> 01:38:23,662
He asked me to marry him! We're
buying a store in Grotta Ferrata!

1146
01:38:23,833 --> 01:38:25,790
He's almost signed the contract.

1147
01:38:25,958 --> 01:38:30,123
Without me knowing, he arranged
it all: a store, a house!

1148
01:38:30,292 --> 01:38:34,491
I'm selling everything!
I'll sell the house... the house...

1149
01:38:36,208 --> 01:38:38,495
We're getting married
in two weeks!

1150
01:38:39,208 --> 01:38:41,916
Wanda, I'm leaving!

1151
01:38:42,500 --> 01:38:44,241
Does he know that you...

1152
01:38:44,375 --> 01:38:46,458
Of course he knows!
I told him everything.

1153
01:38:46,625 --> 01:38:49,038
I didn't hide anything
from him.

1154
01:38:49,250 --> 01:38:51,242
But he's a saint. An angel!

1155
01:38:51,458 --> 01:38:54,451
He didn't want to know
anything. He didn't care.

1156
01:38:54,625 --> 01:38:57,697
He loves me! He loves me!

1157
01:38:58,042 --> 01:38:59,829
Wanda! He loves me!

1158
01:39:16,708 --> 01:39:17,994
Who's there?

1159
01:39:22,375 --> 01:39:24,742
- Hello.
- May I see Brother Giovanni?

1160
01:39:24,917 --> 01:39:27,955
He's not back yet.
Why do you want to see him?

1161
01:39:28,125 --> 01:39:31,618
- To confess to him.
- Go to church for confession.

1162
01:39:33,250 --> 01:39:35,993
I want Father Giovanni
to hear my confession.

1163
01:39:36,167 --> 01:39:39,865
He can't hear your confession.
He's not an ordained priest.

1164
01:39:40,375 --> 01:39:43,789
I know, but...
I'll wait for Father Giovanni.

1165
01:39:44,167 --> 01:39:46,079
Fine. Then wait.

1166
01:39:58,375 --> 01:40:01,914
Why'd you pack this?
I'm not taking that!

1167
01:40:02,083 --> 01:40:04,040
Should I take the owl?

1168
01:40:04,208 --> 01:40:07,531
Nah, it brings bad luck.
But I'll take the seashell.

1169
01:40:07,708 --> 01:40:10,542
See if it fits.
If it fits, I'll take it.

1170
01:40:11,125 --> 01:40:13,208
I sold that.
Put it over there.

1171
01:40:13,542 --> 01:40:18,082
What a waste!
Leaving all this good stuff.

1172
01:40:18,250 --> 01:40:21,243
- Here are the dishes.
- Sold. Leave 'em!

1173
01:40:21,417 --> 01:40:22,453
Them, too?

1174
01:40:22,625 --> 01:40:24,992
Why not?
I got paid for them.

1175
01:40:25,208 --> 01:40:27,916
It would cost more
to move everything.

1176
01:40:28,417 --> 01:40:32,707
He sold everything back home.
So I'm selling everything, too.

1177
01:40:32,875 --> 01:40:33,749
All new!

1178
01:40:33,750 --> 01:40:38,245
Me, I'd have taken all the stuff.
Are you forgetting anything?

1179
01:40:38,417 --> 01:40:39,874
What could I forget?

1180
01:40:40,125 --> 01:40:43,323
- Did you take the money?
- Of course! I'm no idiot!

1181
01:40:44,583 --> 01:40:45,949
See? You forgot your fur.

1182
01:40:46,125 --> 01:40:48,287
Fur? What fur?

1183
01:40:48,542 --> 01:40:50,784
- No! I don't want that.
- Give it to my aunt?

1184
01:40:50,958 --> 01:40:53,951
Sure, but hurry!
They're waiting to move in!

1185
01:40:54,125 --> 01:40:56,458
Damn it! Those low-lives.

1186
01:40:56,625 --> 01:40:59,038
Close the suitcase. Tight.

1187
01:41:01,458 --> 01:41:02,744
Oh, la mamma!

1188
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:12,869
Take one more look...
and then I'm getting married.

1189
01:41:13,042 --> 01:41:15,534
- What?
- I'm getting married, too.

1190
01:41:15,708 --> 01:41:17,745
What did I say? Nothing.

1191
01:41:29,333 --> 01:41:30,790
How do I look?

1192
01:41:32,042 --> 01:41:33,042
Real good.

1193
01:41:33,833 --> 01:41:35,415
It cost me 1,200 lire.

1194
01:41:35,625 --> 01:41:37,036
You got robbed.

1195
01:41:37,458 --> 01:41:39,040
You paid too much.

1196
01:41:42,167 --> 01:41:43,783
Ah, my pocketbook.

1197
01:41:43,958 --> 01:41:46,450
Goodbye, D'Artagnan.
Let's get going.

1198
01:41:47,500 --> 01:41:49,742
Time to leave.
Let's get going.

1199
01:42:03,792 --> 01:42:07,240
See them? I can't stand
those starving bastards.

1200
01:42:10,583 --> 01:42:11,869
Let's go.

1201
01:42:18,375 --> 01:42:22,039
Here are the house keys.
I'm leaving. Arrivederci.

1202
01:42:24,125 --> 01:42:27,744
If you need anything, just tell
my friend, Signorina Wanda.

1203
01:42:27,917 --> 01:42:30,250
She'll write to me.
Arriverderci.

1204
01:42:31,167 --> 01:42:33,159
Have a good trip. Good luck!

1205
01:42:33,333 --> 01:42:35,290
Thank you. Likewise.

1206
01:42:50,792 --> 01:42:53,660
Never mind. I don't wanna
say goodbye to anybody.

1207
01:42:54,333 --> 01:42:56,120
It's better that way.

1208
01:42:56,292 --> 01:42:59,330
I'm so happy now,
and then all these people...

1209
01:42:59,500 --> 01:43:01,412
They'll ask questions...

1210
01:43:02,667 --> 01:43:03,947
I'm leaving.
I'm getting married!

1211
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:08,119
- Send us some wedding candy!
- I will!

1212
01:43:10,292 --> 01:43:13,956
Say goodbye to Nando and
his uncle, and to everyone.

1213
01:43:23,250 --> 01:43:24,366
Nice, eh?

1214
01:43:25,458 --> 01:43:26,869
They're pretty.

1215
01:43:31,833 --> 01:43:33,665
You're getting married

1216
01:43:33,833 --> 01:43:37,156
and I never met
this fiancé of yours.

1217
01:43:37,333 --> 01:43:39,871
I couldn't bring him
where everybody knows me.

1218
01:43:41,250 --> 01:43:42,707
Here's the bus.

1219
01:43:45,458 --> 01:43:46,539
It's here.

1220
01:43:54,583 --> 01:43:57,872
Ciao, Wanda...
Why are you crying?

1221
01:43:59,250 --> 01:44:00,616
Who's crying?

1222
01:44:00,833 --> 01:44:02,119
Aren't you crying?

1223
01:44:04,708 --> 01:44:08,657
I'll write the minute I get there
with my address.

1224
01:44:09,917 --> 01:44:12,159
And you'll get married, too.

1225
01:44:12,917 --> 01:44:13,917
Let's go.

1226
01:44:14,083 --> 01:44:18,373
Hurry, the suitcase.
I'll send my address right away.

1227
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:36,041
Stay out of trouble.
You'll get a miracle, like me.

1228
01:44:36,208 --> 01:44:38,746
- Yeah, sure.
- It'll happen.

1229
01:45:22,083 --> 01:45:24,746
- What are you doing?
- I want to pay.

1230
01:45:24,917 --> 01:45:27,705
- But there's no reason...
- Please! You've always paid.

1231
01:45:27,875 --> 01:45:30,367
Anyway, what's mine is yours now.

1232
01:45:30,542 --> 01:45:33,125
It's all the same, isn't it?

1233
01:45:36,583 --> 01:45:37,824
Waiter!

1234
01:45:43,958 --> 01:45:45,324
It's getting late.

1235
01:45:49,042 --> 01:45:51,625
You'll see how beautiful
the sunsets are up here.

1236
01:45:59,042 --> 01:46:00,999
You want to get me drunk?

1237
01:46:01,542 --> 01:46:03,329
It's such a light wine.

1238
01:46:12,708 --> 01:46:14,165
The money.

1239
01:46:16,500 --> 01:46:17,911
Put it away.

1240
01:46:19,833 --> 01:46:21,290
It's my dowry.

1241
01:46:24,375 --> 01:46:27,868
350,000 for the house.
That's all those crooks would pay.

1242
01:46:28,042 --> 01:46:31,160
They knew I was in a hurry,
so they took advantage.

1243
01:46:31,333 --> 01:46:34,451
Then I got all my money
from the bank.

1244
01:46:34,625 --> 01:46:35,957
400,000.

1245
01:46:36,875 --> 01:46:39,333
See? I made them give me
all new bills.

1246
01:47:00,333 --> 01:47:03,201
Because you never asked
if I had money...

1247
01:47:03,583 --> 01:47:06,826
You, you're an angel,
a saint!

1248
01:47:07,542 --> 01:47:12,116
If you knew what I went through
to end up with this money.

1249
01:47:12,500 --> 01:47:15,538
I told you, I don't want to know.
Please!

1250
01:47:16,417 --> 01:47:18,283
Let's get away from here.

1251
01:47:19,875 --> 01:47:22,458
The beatings I took.

1252
01:47:22,625 --> 01:47:26,164
You see, some guys are
just after a girl's money.

1253
01:47:26,333 --> 01:47:28,325
You wouldn't believe it.

1254
01:47:28,792 --> 01:47:32,240
Everything for love.
But not that way.

1255
01:47:32,417 --> 01:47:35,535
But what about my old age?

1256
01:47:35,667 --> 01:47:37,499
Who worries about my old age?

1257
01:47:37,625 --> 01:47:39,161
I'm sorry...

1258
01:47:41,833 --> 01:47:44,325
Waiter, keep the change.

1259
01:47:44,500 --> 01:47:45,661
Let's go.

1260
01:47:46,458 --> 01:47:49,906
I didn't want to go on
like that forever.

1261
01:47:50,083 --> 01:47:53,121
I'd have quit if I could,
even tomorrow.

1262
01:47:53,292 --> 01:47:54,578
I'd have gone away.

1263
01:47:55,375 --> 01:47:58,664
To live that way forever?
I already owned the house.

1264
01:47:58,833 --> 01:48:00,620
Know what me
and Wanda planned?

1265
01:48:00,792 --> 01:48:02,784
Rent a newsstand.

1266
01:48:03,042 --> 01:48:08,162
Understand? You didn't exist...
Where are we going?

1267
01:48:08,417 --> 01:48:09,703
It's so nice here.

1268
01:48:09,875 --> 01:48:12,117
Let's take a little walk. O.K.?

1269
01:48:13,750 --> 01:48:16,083
I don't even remember
how I started.

1270
01:48:16,250 --> 01:48:19,368
I was a child,
that's all I remember.

1271
01:48:20,125 --> 01:48:21,491
And the suitcases?

1272
01:48:21,792 --> 01:48:23,499
We'll take them later.

1273
01:48:24,375 --> 01:48:27,163
You should have seen me at fifteen

1274
01:48:27,333 --> 01:48:31,031
with my black hair,
long, down to here.

1275
01:48:31,208 --> 01:48:33,951
Who understood anything?
My mother just wanted the money.

1276
01:48:34,125 --> 01:48:35,912
Where are we going?

1277
01:48:36,083 --> 01:48:38,291
I don't know.
We're just strolling.

1278
01:48:39,375 --> 01:48:41,241
What's the name of that song?

1279
01:48:55,417 --> 01:48:56,783
Won't you kiss me?

1280
01:49:20,875 --> 01:49:21,875
Come...

1281
01:49:23,208 --> 01:49:24,208
I know a shortcut.

1282
01:49:54,208 --> 01:49:56,370
Oscar! Where are you?

1283
01:49:56,833 --> 01:49:59,826
What a bad boy you are!

1284
01:50:02,792 --> 01:50:05,159
Look at these flowers.
Like 'em?

1285
01:50:05,333 --> 01:50:07,040
They stink, but still...

1286
01:50:08,042 --> 01:50:10,204
I never saw flowers
like these before.

1287
01:50:10,375 --> 01:50:11,536
Let's go.

1288
01:50:11,958 --> 01:50:13,119
I'm coming.

1289
01:50:16,750 --> 01:50:19,493
Smell them.
What kind of flowers are they?

1290
01:50:20,125 --> 01:50:22,082
What's wrong? Are you sad?

1291
01:50:22,708 --> 01:50:23,824
Me? No. Why?

1292
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,458
You stopped singing.
Wait a minute.

1293
01:50:31,250 --> 01:50:34,118
Why don't we carve
our initials on the trees?

1294
01:50:35,667 --> 01:50:37,784
Let's go and watch the sunset.

1295
01:50:37,958 --> 01:50:42,077
The sunset, eh?
Where do you wanna go?

1296
01:50:57,875 --> 01:50:59,537
What a strange light.

1297
01:51:15,083 --> 01:51:16,449
Beautiful, isn't it?

1298
01:51:19,875 --> 01:51:22,618
Guess there's some justice
in the world.

1299
01:51:24,583 --> 01:51:28,532
You suffer,
you go through hell...

1300
01:51:29,875 --> 01:51:33,494
but then happiness
comes along for everyone.

1301
01:51:36,208 --> 01:51:38,040
You've been my angel.

1302
01:51:38,708 --> 01:51:41,291
Your hand is freezing.
Are you cold?

1303
01:51:44,833 --> 01:51:46,495
Having regrets?

1304
01:51:49,708 --> 01:51:50,915
Beautiful, eh?

1305
01:51:52,333 --> 01:51:54,165
Look how deep it is!

1306
01:51:54,625 --> 01:51:57,117
I'd love a boat ride
right now.

1307
01:51:58,375 --> 01:52:01,038
Are there any boats
down there now?

1308
01:52:01,208 --> 01:52:03,370
- Can you swim?
- Not me!

1309
01:52:03,917 --> 01:52:06,910
I almost drowned once.
But they saved me.

1310
01:52:07,083 --> 01:52:09,200
Just imagine!
I was pushed in!

1311
01:52:13,458 --> 01:52:14,790
What's wrong?

1312
01:52:29,250 --> 01:52:30,832
What's the matter?

1313
01:52:33,792 --> 01:52:36,250
You don't want to kill me,
do you?

1314
01:52:38,333 --> 01:52:39,869
Answer me!

1315
01:52:40,833 --> 01:52:42,574
You want to kill me?

1316
01:52:44,708 --> 01:52:46,415
You want to kill me!

1317
01:52:47,333 --> 01:52:50,872
Don't just stand there.
Say something!

1318
01:52:51,542 --> 01:52:56,242
Speak! Don't be like that!
Speak!

1319
01:52:57,625 --> 01:52:59,036
Tell me.

1320
01:53:04,708 --> 01:53:06,119
For the money?

1321
01:53:09,500 --> 01:53:11,457
For the money...

1322
01:53:37,833 --> 01:53:40,792
Kill me!
Throw me off the cliff!

1323
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:44,368
I don't wanna live anymore!

1324
01:53:47,875 --> 01:53:52,119
Kill me!
I don't wanna live anymore!

1325
01:53:52,292 --> 01:53:54,659
Kill me!

1326
01:53:54,833 --> 01:53:56,449
Throw me off!

1327
01:54:03,500 --> 01:54:04,536
Shut up!

1328
01:54:07,208 --> 01:54:10,622
I don't want to hurt you.
Can't you see that?

1329
01:54:11,458 --> 01:54:13,575
I don't wanna live anymore!

1330
01:54:17,333 --> 01:54:19,040
Kill me!

1331
01:55:44,125 --> 01:55:48,039
Maurizio, hurry up!
We're leaving.

1332
01:55:59,167 --> 01:56:02,456
We're gonna lose our way
going home!

1333
01:57:37,708 --> 01:57:40,200
