1
00:04:20,626 --> 00:04:22,326
$14.50

2
00:04:28,834 --> 00:04:29,934
thanks, hon.

3
00:04:36,608 --> 00:04:37,742
Everyday.

4
00:05:27,092 --> 00:05:29,760
Lee, I'm gonna step out
of the car.

5
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:42,133
I guess you have heard the
nature foundation finally hired

6
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:43,634
an executive director.

7
00:06:44,136 --> 00:06:45,403
So?

8
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:46,837
So.
So...

9
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:48,739
He's 35 and never been married.

10
00:06:49,141 --> 00:06:50,441
So?

11
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:53,511
So, he's 35 and never
been married.

12
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:54,945
He's gotta be gay.
Oh, he's gay.

13
00:06:56,448 --> 00:06:57,982
Don't you think you're
jumping to conclusions?

14
00:06:57,984 --> 00:06:59,483
I bet I'm his type.

15
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:00,651
You're not his type,
I'm his type.

16
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:01,719
I'm his type.

17
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:04,755
Aren't you on their board?

18
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:06,557
Whose board?

19
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:07,792
The nature foundation.

20
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:09,960
Yes, you can introduce us.

21
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:11,028
Yes.

22
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:11,028
No.

23
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:13,931
You can throw a party for him.
Why would I do that?

24
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:16,734
You love parties. You have
parties for everyone.

25
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:18,969
We're not going to have a party
just so that you two can...

26
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:20,438
Act like idiots.

27
00:07:22,707 --> 00:07:23,808
You know what?

28
00:07:24,576 --> 00:07:25,843
Screw this.

29
00:07:25,845 --> 00:07:27,044
Come on, Lyle.

30
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:28,679
Don't need your stupid parties.

31
00:07:30,615 --> 00:07:31,816
Hey.

32
00:07:33,685 --> 00:07:36,787
I've already agreed to have a
party for him in two weeks.

33
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:39,690
Damn. That was easy.

34
00:07:39,692 --> 00:07:40,858
Later, loser.

35
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,627
Hey.

36
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:17,761
Looks a lot like work.

37
00:08:18,497 --> 00:08:19,663
It's not that bad.

38
00:08:21,967 --> 00:08:23,033
So...

39
00:08:23,935 --> 00:08:25,970
I know this is...

40
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:28,706
Really none of my business.

41
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:31,876
But, I was talking to Cathy

42
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:35,579
and she happened
to mention that...

43
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:37,715
You've been drinking
a lot, lately.

44
00:08:42,721 --> 00:08:44,822
Hey, I'm sorry I'm late.

45
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:51,228
I just stopped by the store.

46
00:08:56,535 --> 00:08:57,968
Did you get to sleep?

47
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,036
No.

48
00:08:59,871 --> 00:09:01,672
Got to talk to Tina, though.

49
00:09:06,211 --> 00:09:07,545
Really?

50
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,915
You told her I drank too much?

51
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,018
You do drink too much.

52
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,553
You get drunk everyday.

53
00:09:16,855 --> 00:09:18,656
What am I supposed to do?

54
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:20,758
Just act like everything's
all right, while you crawl

55
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,259
into a beer every night,
is that it?

56
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:27,097
You don't even know I exist,

57
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:29,867
I have to talk to someone
every now and then.

58
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:31,936
Why can't you keep
your mouth shut?

59
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:33,871
You've been talking
to her about our sex life.

60
00:09:34,205 --> 00:09:35,739
What sex life?

61
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:37,675
We haven't had sex in months.

62
00:09:43,615 --> 00:09:45,249
Why are you so miserable, Lee?

63
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,184
Why do you drink so much?

64
00:09:47,186 --> 00:09:48,852
I am sick of it.

65
00:09:50,589 --> 00:09:52,356
Is it because you lost your job?

66
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:54,758
Or is it because you
dropped out of school?

67
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,727
Is it because
your daddy left you?

68
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:57,995
Your mommy put you in day care?

69
00:09:57,997 --> 00:09:59,163
Keep quiet.
Is that it?

70
00:10:00,265 --> 00:10:01,899
Why don't you get over it?

71
00:10:06,271 --> 00:10:08,072
Why can't you have sex with me?

72
00:10:09,841 --> 00:10:11,375
You know what I think?

73
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:12,776
I don't think it's me at all.

74
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:14,078
You know what I think?
I think you're a...

75
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,013
Shut up!
Just shut up!

76
00:10:46,811 --> 00:10:48,112
I'm not sure,

77
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:54,251
I saw the man grab her,

78
00:10:54,253 --> 00:10:58,055
and then he pushed her,

79
00:10:58,057 --> 00:10:59,890
and she fell.

80
00:11:01,326 --> 00:11:02,760
Did he say anything?

81
00:11:02,961 --> 00:11:04,028
No.

82
00:11:04,863 --> 00:11:06,730
Um, actually...

83
00:11:07,165 --> 00:11:09,400
Yes, he said...

84
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:10,801
"I'll kill you."

85
00:11:12,337 --> 00:11:13,837
Are you sure about that?

86
00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:17,274
Yes, he said he would kill her.

87
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:19,043
Well, that makes this a felony.

88
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:20,177
A felony?

89
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:22,146
Yeah.

90
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:24,248
Aggravated malicious wounding.

91
00:11:27,352 --> 00:11:29,953
Well, thank you very much
for your time.

92
00:11:29,955 --> 00:11:31,755
She was lucky you were around.

93
00:11:44,269 --> 00:11:45,803
Hey, Ben.

94
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:47,071
Hey, Jeb.

95
00:11:47,073 --> 00:11:49,039
This is going to be
another 20 minutes.

96
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,841
Uh, the judge has worked in
another hearing.

97
00:11:51,009 --> 00:11:52,142
God.

98
00:11:55,113 --> 00:11:56,433
Some drunk beat up
his girlfriend.

99
00:11:58,183 --> 00:11:59,783
Thanks.
Yeah.

100
00:12:03,121 --> 00:12:04,755
George Wickham.

101
00:12:04,757 --> 00:12:06,490
Ben. Ben Bennett.

102
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:09,426
It's my first time here.
Any advice?

103
00:12:10,228 --> 00:12:11,962
Uh, well...

104
00:12:11,964 --> 00:12:13,330
What kind of case do you have?

105
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:15,232
Criminal defense.

106
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,501
Then you're sitting
at the wrong table.

107
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:19,303
Uh, the prosecutor sits
over there.

108
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:20,370
Right, thanks.

109
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:24,241
Where do you practice?

110
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,443
Knoxville, mostly
in northeast Tennessee.

111
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:29,113
Where'd you go to school?

112
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:30,380
Uh, Richmond.

113
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:31,448
You?

114
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:32,516
Uh, Yale.

115
00:12:33,118 --> 00:12:35,119
Well, excuse me.

116
00:12:36,454 --> 00:12:38,155
Here's that case you asked for.

117
00:12:38,857 --> 00:12:39,857
Great.

118
00:12:43,895 --> 00:12:45,963
So, what's the hold up?

119
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:48,766
Uh, judge is working in
a hearing.

120
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,334
Some drunk beat up
his girlfriend.

121
00:13:04,983 --> 00:13:06,850
All rise.

122
00:13:46,457 --> 00:13:48,258
Don't cut...
Hey.

123
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:52,529
Everything looks great.

124
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:56,366
I've planned on sending a couple of
servers out with trays around seven.

125
00:13:56,368 --> 00:13:58,001
That be all right?

126
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:59,269
That's great.
Good.

127
00:14:04,309 --> 00:14:05,409
Glass of wine?

128
00:14:06,311 --> 00:14:07,511
Yes.

129
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:08,946
Thank you.
You're welcome.

130
00:14:25,597 --> 00:14:27,497
There's nobody here.
Let's go.

131
00:14:30,268 --> 00:14:31,501
Yes?

132
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:33,337
Good afternoon.

133
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:35,172
We got some hot meals for you.

134
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:37,107
We're from community in action.

135
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:40,979
What is it?

136
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:45,916
Roast beef, uh, mashed
potatoes, some green beans.

137
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:54,191
God bless you.

138
00:15:05,637 --> 00:15:08,972
<i>So, who's this party for anyway?</i>

139
00:15:08,974 --> 00:15:12,943
Chuck Bingley, the new executive
director for the nature foundation.

140
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:15,045
So, I'm guessing he's gay?

141
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:16,413
I'm pretty sure he's straight,

142
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:17,481
I've only met him once.

143
00:15:18,116 --> 00:15:19,316
What's he like?

144
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:21,518
Well, he's good-looking.

145
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,020
He's into nature.

146
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:25,188
A little rough around the edges.

147
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:28,325
Awkward around people, I'm afraid he
won't impress some of the bigger donors.

148
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:32,462
Well, do they want someone that knows land
preservation or looks good on a golf course?

149
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:33,563
Oh, both.

150
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:37,634
It started at four o'clock.

151
00:15:37,636 --> 00:15:39,703
You did not. Four o'clock, for a party?
Yes, he did.

152
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:41,605
Lyle, really?

153
00:15:42,173 --> 00:15:43,240
Oh.

154
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:44,308
Is he here yet?

155
00:15:44,509 --> 00:15:45,575
No.

156
00:15:46,577 --> 00:15:47,644
He's straight.

157
00:15:48,112 --> 00:15:49,179
Shit.

158
00:15:50,615 --> 00:15:51,682
Really?

159
00:15:54,619 --> 00:15:56,253
Let's get a drink.

160
00:16:05,997 --> 00:16:07,331
Here it is.

161
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:08,999
You sure it's all right
if I tag along?

162
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,267
Yeah.

163
00:16:11,436 --> 00:16:13,103
I don't think
I'm ready for this.

164
00:16:14,138 --> 00:16:15,418
Do you want me to take you home?

165
00:16:17,075 --> 00:16:18,141
Yeah.

166
00:16:18,376 --> 00:16:19,443
Okay.

167
00:16:20,244 --> 00:16:21,311
No.

168
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,281
Can't keep avoiding people.

169
00:16:24,615 --> 00:16:26,416
Look.

170
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:28,858
Just let me know if you wanna
leave, it's no big deal, really.

171
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:32,389
You've only been
in recovery a month.

172
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:33,657
Don't be so hard on yourself.

173
00:16:35,326 --> 00:16:36,393
Thanks.

174
00:16:39,163 --> 00:16:40,764
Oh, perfect timing.

175
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:44,434
Um, excuse me.

176
00:16:50,074 --> 00:16:52,042
Um, hi.

177
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:53,143
Uh, you must be Chuck.

178
00:16:53,544 --> 00:16:54,644
I'm Chuck.

179
00:16:56,147 --> 00:16:57,647
And I'm Jane Gardiner.

180
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,784
Uh, um, this is Lee.

181
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:02,252
Hello.

182
00:17:02,254 --> 00:17:03,687
Well, come on inside.

183
00:17:09,727 --> 00:17:11,495
There's the guest of honor.

184
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:12,562
Sorry, we're late.

185
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:13,797
Don't worry about it.

186
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:15,479
Everybody's looking
forward to meeting you.

187
00:17:17,268 --> 00:17:18,368
Oh, uh...

188
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:19,770
This is my friend, Lee Darcy.

189
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:21,204
Lee works at Eastgate.

190
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:22,572
We did volunteer work together.

191
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:24,374
Lee, this is Ben Bennett.

192
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:26,243
Ben's in the board
of the nature foundation.

193
00:17:26,711 --> 00:17:28,278
Nice to meet you.

194
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,714
Glad you were able to make it.

195
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,249
I've met you before, haven't I?

196
00:17:33,718 --> 00:17:35,719
Eastgate, do you work
with Jon Ross?

197
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,554
He and I have done a
bunch of deals together.

198
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:40,490
I know Mr. Ross, but I
don't think he knows me.

199
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:42,225
I work in the machine shop.

200
00:17:44,796 --> 00:17:47,798
All right, well, come
on, have a drink.

201
00:17:55,473 --> 00:17:57,741
I think everything's going well.

202
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:01,511
It certainly seems to be going
well for Jane and Daniel Boone.

203
00:18:04,515 --> 00:18:07,617
He's not her type,
she's just playing hostess.

204
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:11,288
She's playing something
but it ain't hostess.

205
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:12,789
Well, uh...

206
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:15,325
It'd allow me to dirtbag my way
around Colorado and Wyoming.

207
00:18:17,328 --> 00:18:21,098
Hey, uh, we're just talking
about Chuck's new job.

208
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,600
You had a chance to get up
in the mountains here, yet?

209
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,836
Yeah, I've already seen
some amazing places.

210
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:28,271
I'm going hiking this
Saturday at Whitetop.

211
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:29,673
Do you hike?

212
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:31,475
Would you two like to tag along?

213
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:34,611
That sounds fun.

214
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:37,347
Well, I wish I could.
I have a lot of work to do.

215
00:18:42,453 --> 00:18:46,223
Oh, um, maybe some other time.

216
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:48,758
Well, I need another drink.
Can I get you something?

217
00:18:50,261 --> 00:18:51,561
Um...

218
00:18:51,563 --> 00:18:52,863
I'm fine.

219
00:18:53,831 --> 00:18:55,799
Excuse me.
Thank you.

220
00:19:00,171 --> 00:19:02,372
What are you doing, you idiot?

221
00:19:02,374 --> 00:19:04,508
Why'd you tell him
that you couldn't go?

222
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:07,611
He's gorgeous and nice,
I wanna go.

223
00:19:08,146 --> 00:19:09,880
Go.

224
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:12,716
I can't do that, he asked us together,
he thinks that we're a couple.

225
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:14,351
Why would he think
we're a couple?

226
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:15,785
Because we act like a couple!

227
00:19:15,787 --> 00:19:17,754
Don't deny him. Go.

228
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:19,456
I can't do that,
I'll look desperate.

229
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,291
Just tell him that you've
changed your mind.

230
00:19:22,793 --> 00:19:24,628
Then he'd still think
we're a couple

231
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:26,363
and I have a lot of work to do.

232
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:28,198
You work all the time.

233
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,800
And he'll figure out we're not
a couple at some other point.

234
00:19:30,802 --> 00:19:33,403
Just tell him that you've changed
your mind, and we'll go.

235
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:34,604
Go where?

236
00:19:34,606 --> 00:19:36,573
Go hiking with Chuck
on Saturday.

237
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:37,641
Hiking?

238
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:41,278
Please?

239
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,346
For once, just do it.

240
00:19:45,616 --> 00:19:47,317
Okay.

241
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:49,653
I'll call him after the party.

242
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:51,188
You don't hike.

243
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,522
What's wrong with him?

244
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:53,857
She doesn't hike.

245
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:53,857
What's going on?

246
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:57,561
Chuck invited Jane and Ben
to go hiking this weekend.

247
00:20:00,331 --> 00:20:01,898
And the queers got left out?

248
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,867
Bullseye, my invisible friend.

249
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,874
What are you doing
this Saturday?

250
00:20:15,413 --> 00:20:18,281
Well, actually, we just
got back from Cabo

251
00:20:18,283 --> 00:20:21,351
and normally, we would about spend
two weeks there, but Bob had to come

252
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:24,254
back early, because we had
to oversee the construction

253
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:26,256
of the lake house.
So...

254
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:28,225
Oh, that's great,
will you excuse me?

255
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,292
Sure.

256
00:20:42,673 --> 00:20:44,641
Still trying to figure
out where I've seen you.

257
00:20:46,344 --> 00:20:50,814
Everyone please hold your
cards for a possible bingo.

258
00:20:51,315 --> 00:20:52,716
Who is that?

259
00:21:02,794 --> 00:21:05,895
Let me introduce you
to my friends.

260
00:21:05,897 --> 00:21:07,731
This is Kittner Frost.

261
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:10,500
Hey, pleasure to meet you.

262
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:12,902
I'm the vice president
at old dominion bank.

263
00:21:12,904 --> 00:21:12,902
Welcome to Abingdon.

264
00:21:12,904 --> 00:21:17,741
If you need anything, please,
please, let me know.

265
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:20,043
Kittner. And this
is Lyle Jennings.

266
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:21,444
Lyle is...

267
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:23,046
Busy spending his inheritance.

268
00:21:24,315 --> 00:21:26,750
This is Lee Darcy.

269
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:29,419
It's nice to meet you,
what do you do?

270
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:31,288
Um, work at Eastgate.

271
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,757
Oh.
What do you do there?

272
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:35,392
I'm...
I'm a welder.

273
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,527
Oh.

274
00:21:44,068 --> 00:21:46,336
It was nice meeting
you, guys. Excuse me.

275
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:50,840
Sir, would you like a drink?

276
00:21:50,842 --> 00:21:52,509
No, no, thank you.

277
00:22:07,992 --> 00:22:11,661
Oh? Really?
I think you must be right.

278
00:22:13,798 --> 00:22:15,765
Um, excuse me.

279
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:17,033
Sure.

280
00:22:17,868 --> 00:22:19,602
Hey man, I gotta go.

281
00:22:19,604 --> 00:22:21,471
Okay, no problem.

282
00:22:21,473 --> 00:22:23,573
No, you stay here,
I'm gonna go for a walk.

283
00:22:23,575 --> 00:22:24,855
Give me a call when you're done.

284
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:27,410
You sure?
Yeah.

285
00:22:27,412 --> 00:22:28,478
I'm fine, man.

286
00:22:46,464 --> 00:22:48,465
I've just realized where
I've seen him before.

287
00:22:50,134 --> 00:22:52,769
I saw him get charged with
a felony a few months ago.

288
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:58,975
He thinks I'm the biggest asshole
on the face of the planet.

289
00:23:18,929 --> 00:23:20,163
Chuck?

290
00:23:24,101 --> 00:23:25,735
Hope you weren't
waiting too long.

291
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:28,405
Hey, no problem, uh...

292
00:23:29,106 --> 00:23:29,105
I just got here.

293
00:23:29,107 --> 00:23:33,076
Uh, besides, Ben from the party called.
He and his girlfriend

294
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:34,878
are coming, so,
we gotta wait on them.

295
00:23:36,013 --> 00:23:37,113
All right.

296
00:23:38,816 --> 00:23:40,550
I hope that's okay,

297
00:23:40,552 --> 00:23:42,085
I guess I should've asked you.

298
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:43,686
That's cool.

299
00:23:43,688 --> 00:23:43,686
Who's coming?

300
00:23:43,688 --> 00:23:46,790
Well, the couple that
had the party for me?

301
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:49,926
Oh, the party you
went to without me.

302
00:23:51,462 --> 00:23:52,595
I don't know them.

303
00:25:28,092 --> 00:25:29,626
Thank you.

304
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:30,693
You're welcome.

305
00:25:47,811 --> 00:25:49,012
Oh, I hate hiking.

306
00:25:49,647 --> 00:25:50,847
What do you mean?

307
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:52,181
It's such a waste of time.

308
00:25:52,183 --> 00:25:53,917
I really don't see
what the big deal is.

309
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:55,552
I only do it to make Lee happy.

310
00:25:56,854 --> 00:25:58,154
I don't mind hiking alone.

311
00:26:02,126 --> 00:26:03,860
Why don't we head up this Ridge?

312
00:26:03,862 --> 00:26:06,296
So... how long have you
and Ben been together?

313
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:08,798
Jane, how long has it been?
Since kindergarten?

314
00:26:10,267 --> 00:26:12,168
Oh, you mean, together?

315
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:14,938
Yeah, we're not together.

316
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,773
Ben and I are just friends.

317
00:26:16,775 --> 00:26:19,008
Oh, well, Chuck said
you were a couple.

318
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:21,744
Oh, I suppose I just
assumed you were together.

319
00:26:22,613 --> 00:26:24,047
So, do you have a boyfriend?

320
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:26,115
No.

321
00:26:26,117 --> 00:26:28,718
What about you? Do you
have a girlfriend, Ben?

322
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,986
No, I'm gay.

323
00:26:29,988 --> 00:26:31,688
But I don't have a boyfriend.

324
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:33,089
You don't act like you're gay.

325
00:26:36,026 --> 00:26:37,694
How do gays act?

326
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:40,063
Oh, come on, you know.

327
00:26:40,065 --> 00:26:42,231
No, I don't.

328
00:26:42,233 --> 00:26:44,667
Hey, I don't have
a problem with gays.

329
00:26:44,669 --> 00:26:47,704
We had one where I worked. I
treated him like he was normal.

330
00:26:47,706 --> 00:26:49,606
Come on, Cathy.

331
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:52,875
Ever since, Lee's gone to Aa,
he's Saint Lee the tolerant.

332
00:26:55,045 --> 00:26:56,779
Not all gays

333
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:58,181
are flamboyant.

334
00:27:23,007 --> 00:27:25,708
I didn't think you bitches
would ever stop.

335
00:27:55,239 --> 00:27:56,673
Let's do this.

336
00:27:57,841 --> 00:27:59,442
All right, anything else?

337
00:27:59,444 --> 00:28:01,911
Sit down, son.
It will be over soon.

338
00:28:04,248 --> 00:28:06,883
Glad we were
able to work this one out.

339
00:28:06,885 --> 00:28:10,887
Well, I don't know. It rubs me the
wrong way to allow junior over there

340
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:12,789
to plead to anything
less than a felony.

341
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:13,956
But...

342
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:16,125
You've managed
to trash our only witness.

343
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,394
Besides,

344
00:28:18,396 --> 00:28:21,397
judge Jackson doesn't know
squat about criminal law.

345
00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:23,933
You know he was a real estate
attorney before his political buddies

346
00:28:23,935 --> 00:28:25,468
slipped him on the bench?

347
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:26,869
All rise.

348
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:32,909
Please be seated.

349
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:34,711
Is the commonwealth
ready to proceed?

350
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:34,711
Yes, your honor.

351
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:37,246
Is the defense council
ready to proceed?

352
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:38,981
Yes, your honor.

353
00:28:38,983 --> 00:28:41,451
Gentlemen, looks like we have a
plead ring that's been reached.

354
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:44,454
Yes, subject to your approval...

355
00:28:44,456 --> 00:28:47,990
Uh, the defendant will plead no
contest to the lesser charges

356
00:28:47,992 --> 00:28:49,992
of assault and battery...

357
00:28:49,994 --> 00:28:52,495
With the recommended
sentence of one year probation.

358
00:28:55,299 --> 00:28:56,499
Well...

359
00:28:58,001 --> 00:29:00,803
I've, uh, reviewed the record.

360
00:29:02,206 --> 00:29:05,374
Stipulation indicates that,

361
00:29:05,376 --> 00:29:08,411
the defendant's girlfriend suffered
a concussion and broken arm.

362
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:11,447
Seems like an extremely light
sentence under such circumstances.

363
00:29:13,484 --> 00:29:18,121
Your honor, the commonwealth has serious
problems with its only witness.

364
00:29:18,123 --> 00:29:22,291
Also, Mr. Carol just indicated he has concerns
regarding the court's lack of experience

365
00:29:22,293 --> 00:29:23,392
in handling criminal cases.

366
00:29:27,765 --> 00:29:29,298
Your honor,

367
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,267
we would like
to ask that the, uh...

368
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:34,370
Defendant be allowed to leave
the state despite probation

369
00:29:34,372 --> 00:29:36,172
to attend Notre Dame this fall.

370
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,374
No objection.

371
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:41,110
Very well.

372
00:29:43,447 --> 00:29:45,414
Let's take a short recess.

373
00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:47,416
Mr. Carol, see me
in chambers.

374
00:29:47,418 --> 00:29:48,851
All rise.

375
00:29:59,296 --> 00:30:00,797
Thank you very much.

376
00:30:03,133 --> 00:30:05,067
Hey, what are you
doing here, handsome?

377
00:30:05,569 --> 00:30:06,836
Had a hearing,

378
00:30:06,838 --> 00:30:08,304
I am too.
Just finishing up.

379
00:30:08,939 --> 00:30:10,239
That was John Altman.

380
00:30:10,241 --> 00:30:10,239
Senator?

381
00:30:10,241 --> 00:30:13,509
Son had too much to drink, got
a little rough with the date.

382
00:30:13,511 --> 00:30:14,877
What was the charge?

383
00:30:14,879 --> 00:30:17,246
Aggravated malicious wounding.

384
00:30:17,248 --> 00:30:19,148
How did she get
a domestic abuse felony

385
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:21,217
reduced to a simple misdemeanor?

386
00:30:21,219 --> 00:30:22,885
The kind of money
the Altman's have,

387
00:30:22,887 --> 00:30:24,821
my entire staff's been working
on this case for two months.

388
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:26,455
All they had to do was dig
up enough dirt on the girl,

389
00:30:26,457 --> 00:30:28,191
to blow holes
in her credibility.

390
00:30:28,193 --> 00:30:30,226
And you're not above
a cheap trick?

391
00:30:30,228 --> 00:30:33,262
Telling the judge that Wayne said he
didn't know how to try a criminal case?

392
00:30:33,264 --> 00:30:34,964
Hey, I didn't make it up.

393
00:30:35,299 --> 00:30:36,866
Besides,

394
00:30:36,868 --> 00:30:39,101
it's my job
to represent my client,

395
00:30:39,103 --> 00:30:41,504
if that means making the prosecutor
look bad, to finalize a plea bargain,

396
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:42,572
then I'm doing it.

397
00:30:42,574 --> 00:30:44,173
How long you tied up here?

398
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:46,375
Forty five minutes.

399
00:30:46,377 --> 00:30:48,010
Good, I should be done by then.

400
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:49,892
Why don't you meet me
at the tavern for a drink?

401
00:30:51,615 --> 00:30:54,050
I shouldn't. I'm
covered up with work.

402
00:30:55,485 --> 00:30:57,587
I might count on you
changing your mind.

403
00:30:58,555 --> 00:31:00,056
It'd mean a lot to me.

404
00:31:01,391 --> 00:31:03,025
Shouldn't have
to celebrate alone.

405
00:31:04,962 --> 00:31:06,028
Just a drink.

406
00:31:17,307 --> 00:31:18,574
How'd it go?

407
00:31:23,447 --> 00:31:25,514
Good.
Fantastic.

408
00:31:25,516 --> 00:31:27,583
You have anymore
commitments this afternoon?

409
00:31:27,585 --> 00:31:29,418
Actually, no, I don't.

410
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,420
Great, let's celebrate,
let's get that drink.

411
00:31:32,089 --> 00:31:33,489
Yeah.

412
00:31:33,491 --> 00:31:36,125
I... can't.

413
00:31:36,127 --> 00:31:39,962
I'm sorry if I've misread
the situation, all right?

414
00:31:39,964 --> 00:31:41,497
I don't wanna
make you uncomfortable.

415
00:31:43,033 --> 00:31:44,567
Misread the situation?

416
00:31:51,208 --> 00:31:52,675
A drink sounds good.

417
00:31:53,477 --> 00:31:55,278
Great, come on.

418
00:32:04,154 --> 00:32:06,522
She hasn't done anything to make you
think there's a problem, has she?

419
00:32:06,524 --> 00:32:09,724
She's probably not going to be too excited
about me living up here in the sticks.

420
00:32:11,628 --> 00:32:12,929
What about you?

421
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:15,131
Is it hard not to drink?

422
00:32:15,966 --> 00:32:17,133
Sometimes.

423
00:32:19,236 --> 00:32:20,403
What makes it worse?

424
00:32:22,339 --> 00:32:23,572
I think too much.

425
00:32:24,274 --> 00:32:25,408
Thinking about what?

426
00:32:29,346 --> 00:32:30,980
It's kind of hard to explain.

427
00:32:34,251 --> 00:32:35,651
You don't know what
I'm really like.

428
00:32:38,221 --> 00:32:40,122
So...

429
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:41,324
What are you really like?

430
00:32:43,026 --> 00:32:44,226
I'm, uh...

431
00:32:51,301 --> 00:32:52,468
Screwed up.

432
00:32:55,539 --> 00:32:57,039
That's not what
you were gonna say.

433
00:33:07,751 --> 00:33:09,685
You know...

434
00:33:09,687 --> 00:33:11,220
Why don't you stay over tonight?

435
00:33:12,189 --> 00:33:13,489
Go hiking in the morning?

436
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:15,291
Oh, I wish I could.

437
00:33:15,293 --> 00:33:17,626
I have to get up early and
hit the office, I got a...

438
00:33:17,628 --> 00:33:19,228
Big hearing on Monday.

439
00:33:20,297 --> 00:33:21,764
Yeah, I should
probably work, too.

440
00:33:24,468 --> 00:33:26,335
But, we'll do this.

441
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:28,170
No hiking.

442
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:31,007
Just stay over tonight, we'll
leave first thing in the morning.

443
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:33,309
I never really can sleep
well except in my own bed.

444
00:33:39,182 --> 00:33:40,449
Do you remember, Lee Darcy?

445
00:33:40,451 --> 00:33:42,651
You were representing
him when I met you.

446
00:33:42,653 --> 00:33:43,786
Yeah, I guess so.

447
00:33:45,589 --> 00:33:47,223
He was there, uh...

448
00:33:47,225 --> 00:33:49,558
Went hiking
with a friend of mine.

449
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,560
Why would a friend of yours
know someone like that?

450
00:33:53,096 --> 00:33:55,197
Funny, you should mention them.

451
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:57,566
The neighbor came into
my office a while back,

452
00:33:57,568 --> 00:33:59,568
tried to change her story.

453
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:02,238
Apparently he didn't say he was
going to kill his girlfriend,

454
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,106
but he split her head open.

455
00:34:04,108 --> 00:34:05,808
Probably banging
the neighbor now.

456
00:34:08,178 --> 00:34:10,146
No, he's still with
the girlfriend.

457
00:34:10,148 --> 00:34:12,415
She was on our hike, too.
Her name is Cathy.

458
00:34:12,417 --> 00:34:14,083
Cathy, yeah, yeah,
I remember her.

459
00:34:15,352 --> 00:34:16,719
Huh, doesn't surprise me,

460
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:19,388
that kind always goes back
in for more abuse.

461
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:21,257
Worthless as a witness too.

462
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:23,019
She said she couldn't
remember what happened.

463
00:34:28,799 --> 00:34:30,266
What are you going
to do about her?

464
00:34:31,735 --> 00:34:34,303
Do about what?

465
00:34:34,305 --> 00:34:38,174
The fact that the only witness against
your client changed her testimony.

466
00:34:38,176 --> 00:34:40,142
Nothing, of course.

467
00:34:40,144 --> 00:34:41,844
Surprised the guy
paid me the first time.

468
00:34:42,712 --> 00:34:44,213
Oh.

469
00:34:44,215 --> 00:34:45,548
But enough shop talk.

470
00:34:48,819 --> 00:34:52,121
But now, before I go...

471
00:34:52,123 --> 00:34:54,790
I couldn't think of a better
way to spend the time.

472
00:35:32,662 --> 00:35:33,729
Hey.

473
00:35:35,732 --> 00:35:36,799
Hey.

474
00:35:45,876 --> 00:35:47,309
Sure is a pretty day.

475
00:35:48,178 --> 00:35:49,278
Yeah.

476
00:35:49,746 --> 00:35:51,514
It is.

477
00:35:51,516 --> 00:35:52,681
It's a great day for a hike.

478
00:35:53,183 --> 00:35:54,250
Yeah.

479
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:58,888
This is a great spot.

480
00:36:01,191 --> 00:36:02,758
This is one of my favorites.

481
00:36:06,396 --> 00:36:07,630
You going any further?

482
00:36:09,699 --> 00:36:11,500
Thought I might head
up to Whitetop.

483
00:36:11,801 --> 00:36:12,868
Me, too.

484
00:36:13,837 --> 00:36:16,605
You hiking alone?
Yeah.

485
00:36:16,607 --> 00:36:18,841
Me, too all my
friends are tied up.

486
00:36:21,711 --> 00:36:24,313
I got the impression
they weren't that into hiking.

487
00:36:24,315 --> 00:36:25,848
They were...

488
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,349
They were kind of colorful.

489
00:36:29,553 --> 00:36:31,520
I enjoyed meeting your
girlfriend, she was, uh...

490
00:36:32,189 --> 00:36:33,389
Pretty colorful.

491
00:36:34,891 --> 00:36:36,592
So you're arrogant
and you're gay?

492
00:36:38,929 --> 00:36:40,829
Yeah, I'm gay.

493
00:36:44,668 --> 00:36:46,569
Actually, I'm dating
George Wickham.

494
00:36:48,338 --> 00:36:51,640
Didn't he, uh,
defend you after you,

495
00:36:51,642 --> 00:36:53,375
got drunk and beat up
your girlfriend?

496
00:36:58,415 --> 00:36:59,481
Yeah.

497
00:37:02,753 --> 00:37:03,919
He did.

498
00:37:11,561 --> 00:37:14,230
Well, I'm gonna get going.

499
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:15,297
I'll see you around.

500
00:37:35,819 --> 00:37:38,454
Okay, I give up.

501
00:37:39,856 --> 00:37:41,423
I actually have to take a break.

502
00:37:44,027 --> 00:37:45,294
Are we almost there?

503
00:37:45,662 --> 00:37:46,929
Yeah.

504
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,364
We're really close.

505
00:37:49,432 --> 00:37:50,933
What's the surprise, anyway?

506
00:37:51,701 --> 00:37:52,901
You'll see.

507
00:37:52,903 --> 00:37:54,737
Come on, give me a hint.

508
00:37:57,007 --> 00:37:58,507
We were hiking all day.

509
00:38:00,877 --> 00:38:01,944
We're almost there.

510
00:38:02,879 --> 00:38:04,280
I promise.

511
00:38:05,649 --> 00:38:06,749
Come on.

512
00:40:04,901 --> 00:40:06,034
Hello?

513
00:40:06,636 --> 00:40:07,936
In here.

514
00:40:07,938 --> 00:40:10,572
Hey, going somewhere?

515
00:40:10,807 --> 00:40:10,806
Yes.

516
00:40:10,808 --> 00:40:14,843
George has agreed to spend the
weekend with me in Asheville.

517
00:40:14,845 --> 00:40:16,044
Did you approve of this?

518
00:40:16,046 --> 00:40:17,579
Absolutely not.

519
00:40:17,881 --> 00:40:19,148
Honey.

520
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:23,552
Honey, we don't need
everything to be so...

521
00:40:23,554 --> 00:40:24,753
Matchy-matchy.

522
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:26,755
We need something
that pops and says,

523
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:28,891
"wow, I'm here."

524
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:43,939
What's wrong with you?

525
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:45,574
You dirty little whore.

526
00:40:47,011 --> 00:40:49,088
You know, you two are so negative.
You're just... jealous.

527
00:40:49,112 --> 00:40:50,546
Jealous?

528
00:40:50,548 --> 00:40:52,714
We haven't even met
Mr. perfect yet.

529
00:40:52,716 --> 00:40:52,714
You'll get a chance to meet him.

530
00:40:52,716 --> 00:40:56,485
When Chuck has his little
party next weekend.

531
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:58,821
At his cabin.

532
00:40:58,823 --> 00:41:00,856
You two are invited
for some bizarre reason.

533
00:41:00,858 --> 00:41:01,924
Really?

534
00:41:02,993 --> 00:41:04,059
It's George.

535
00:41:04,527 --> 00:41:05,794
Hey.

536
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:07,062
Almost finished packing.

537
00:41:09,165 --> 00:41:10,232
Oh.

538
00:41:10,733 --> 00:41:11,834
Well...

539
00:41:12,769 --> 00:41:14,236
No, no, it's okay.

540
00:41:14,238 --> 00:41:16,572
I'll just cancel the hotel
and come over to your place.

541
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:18,607
You sure?

542
00:41:20,477 --> 00:41:21,977
Okay.

543
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:23,479
Try to get some sleep.

544
00:41:24,113 --> 00:41:25,481
Okay.

545
00:41:31,721 --> 00:41:33,755
George is ill.
Trip's off.

546
00:41:33,757 --> 00:41:35,190
What's wrong?

547
00:41:35,192 --> 00:41:36,959
He's been sick all morning.

548
00:41:36,961 --> 00:41:38,026
Hmmm.

549
00:41:38,261 --> 00:41:39,528
What?

550
00:41:44,534 --> 00:41:46,034
I should check on him.

551
00:41:47,971 --> 00:41:49,838
I don't know where he lives.

552
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,106
You don't even know
where he lives?

553
00:41:51,108 --> 00:41:54,076
Yes, I know where
he lives, but I just...

554
00:41:54,078 --> 00:41:56,945
Haven't been to his place,
I don't know his address.

555
00:41:56,947 --> 00:41:58,547
I don't think
you should do that.

556
00:41:59,582 --> 00:42:01,783
He obviously told you
not to come over.

557
00:42:01,785 --> 00:42:03,519
Open your eyes, Shelby.

558
00:42:04,588 --> 00:42:06,688
Shelby, open your eyes.

559
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:08,857
It's not funny.

560
00:42:09,526 --> 00:42:10,692
Not funny.

561
00:43:04,247 --> 00:43:05,647
What are you doing here?

562
00:43:06,583 --> 00:43:07,950
I just came to see how...

563
00:43:10,086 --> 00:43:11,620
Come on, daddy.

564
00:43:16,326 --> 00:43:17,693
Hello.

565
00:43:18,861 --> 00:43:21,263
Karen, this is Ben Bennett.

566
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:22,864
Ben's an attorney at Abingdon.

567
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:26,868
Ben, this is my wife, Karen.

568
00:43:30,073 --> 00:43:31,340
It's nice to meet you.

569
00:43:39,649 --> 00:43:42,017
I'm afraid you caught us
heading out for the weekend.

570
00:43:44,854 --> 00:43:46,355
I was just...

571
00:43:47,223 --> 00:43:48,624
Walking.

572
00:43:52,862 --> 00:43:54,062
I don't wanna keep you.

573
00:43:54,964 --> 00:43:57,366
Well, uh, good to see you again.

574
00:43:59,235 --> 00:44:00,302
Thanks.

575
00:45:39,335 --> 00:45:41,303
There really is a cabin.

576
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:44,339
Great, look who it is.

577
00:45:49,078 --> 00:45:50,178
Hey.

578
00:45:50,947 --> 00:45:52,481
Hey, you made it.

579
00:45:52,483 --> 00:45:53,949
You had trouble
with the directions?

580
00:45:53,951 --> 00:45:55,417
No, they were great.

581
00:45:56,953 --> 00:45:59,354
Hey, thank you for having us.

582
00:45:59,356 --> 00:46:00,956
I'm glad you came.

583
00:46:00,958 --> 00:46:02,424
You guys know Lee and Cathy?

584
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:03,859
Hey.
Hi.

585
00:46:05,294 --> 00:46:07,996
Where's George? Look
forward to meeting him.

586
00:46:07,998 --> 00:46:09,064
Um...

587
00:46:10,133 --> 00:46:11,533
Uh, it didn't work out.

588
00:46:12,769 --> 00:46:14,102
Oh, uh...

589
00:46:15,371 --> 00:46:17,305
Why don't we go inside and
I'll show you around.

590
00:46:18,841 --> 00:46:20,041
We'll be on the deck.

591
00:46:23,913 --> 00:46:25,413
This is my bedroom.

592
00:46:26,949 --> 00:46:28,884
Then through here
is the rest of the place.

593
00:46:45,334 --> 00:46:47,969
Oh, uh, may I use your bathroom?

594
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:50,071
There's a slight problem.

595
00:46:50,073 --> 00:46:52,941
The Springs sometimes runs
dry this time of year.

596
00:46:52,943 --> 00:46:56,978
Well, uh, we won't have
water again until it rains.

597
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:58,413
You'll have to use the outhouse.

598
00:47:00,449 --> 00:47:02,150
That's it, over there.

599
00:47:08,558 --> 00:47:10,058
Oh, uh...

600
00:47:10,593 --> 00:47:12,861
No problem, thanks.

601
00:47:14,463 --> 00:47:16,865
Hold up, back up,
I gotta see this, sorry.

602
00:47:18,568 --> 00:47:21,570
Sorry, we had water
until this morning.

603
00:47:22,205 --> 00:47:23,438
It's all right.

604
00:47:25,474 --> 00:47:26,875
Ah, do you wanna see the deck?

605
00:48:08,918 --> 00:48:10,051
Hey.

606
00:48:19,996 --> 00:48:22,716
You don't have to go. You don't have
to leave just 'cause I got here.

607
00:48:26,369 --> 00:48:29,304
I know it's not
any of my business, but...

608
00:48:29,306 --> 00:48:31,273
Why'd you plead guilty
to a felony?

609
00:48:33,976 --> 00:48:35,343
I don't want to talk about it.

610
00:48:36,445 --> 00:48:37,946
I'm an alcoholic.

611
00:48:40,082 --> 00:48:43,318
Cathy and I got into an argument,
and I threatened to kill her.

612
00:48:45,288 --> 00:48:46,688
Pushed her

613
00:48:46,690 --> 00:48:48,023
and she hit her head.

614
00:48:50,059 --> 00:48:51,259
She had to go to the hospital.

615
00:48:55,631 --> 00:48:58,333
So, you threatened to kill her?
What did you say?

616
00:48:59,568 --> 00:49:00,969
I don't...

617
00:49:00,971 --> 00:49:02,504
I don't remember
the actual words.

618
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:06,641
I was very drunk.

619
00:49:06,643 --> 00:49:08,510
Not that I'm using
this as an excuse.

620
00:49:09,712 --> 00:49:11,947
I take full responsibility
for what I did.

621
00:49:14,483 --> 00:49:16,351
I just don't remember
the details.

622
00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:20,288
I understand I said,

623
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:22,557
"I'll kill you",
when I pushed her.

624
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:24,259
Where was the evidence
that you said that?

625
00:49:26,095 --> 00:49:27,963
Well, my neighbor
heard me say it.

626
00:49:28,998 --> 00:49:31,733
And my attorney, George.

627
00:49:33,202 --> 00:49:36,271
He said, I didn't have
a defense because...

628
00:49:36,273 --> 00:49:37,633
There was
an independent witness...

629
00:49:38,307 --> 00:49:40,241
Testifying against me.

630
00:49:40,243 --> 00:49:41,723
And I have no memory
of what happened.

631
00:49:44,613 --> 00:49:46,348
Did George interview
the neighbor?

632
00:49:48,286 --> 00:49:49,185
No.

633
00:49:49,186 --> 00:49:54,089
But, uh, the policeman
took her statement.

634
00:49:54,091 --> 00:49:55,423
Did Cathy say
you threatened her?

635
00:49:55,425 --> 00:49:57,158
She doesn't really
remember what happened.

636
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:58,393
Look...

637
00:49:58,395 --> 00:50:00,095
I didn't intend
to get into all this.

638
00:50:01,163 --> 00:50:02,731
I messed up.

639
00:50:02,733 --> 00:50:04,599
I had a job lined up in Atlanta.

640
00:50:04,601 --> 00:50:06,501
Cathy and I were going
to move down there.

641
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:09,504
But in a strange way,
it's better.

642
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:11,506
I'm finally taking
responsibility for my actions.

643
00:50:13,175 --> 00:50:15,110
Making excuses
doesn't change anything.

644
00:50:20,116 --> 00:50:23,518
I'm really sorry about what I
said, the day of your hearing.

645
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,387
I didn't know you were there.

646
00:50:25,389 --> 00:50:26,788
I wasn't thinking about
what I was saying,

647
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:28,790
I didn't have any idea
of what I was saying.

648
00:50:30,526 --> 00:50:31,760
I'm really sorry.

649
00:50:32,595 --> 00:50:33,762
Lee.

650
00:50:38,401 --> 00:50:39,768
I better go.

651
00:51:08,197 --> 00:51:09,330
Almost ready.

652
00:51:09,332 --> 00:51:10,398
Oh, great.

653
00:51:14,837 --> 00:51:16,371
Looks like we're just in time.

654
00:51:16,373 --> 00:51:17,505
Yeah.

655
00:51:17,507 --> 00:51:18,840
Need help with anything?

656
00:51:18,842 --> 00:51:21,543
Um, so yeah, I need
to run inside.

657
00:51:21,545 --> 00:51:23,111
You better let me handle this.

658
00:51:25,114 --> 00:51:26,381
Has anyone seen Ben?

659
00:51:53,642 --> 00:51:55,410
Lee, would you mind
saying the blessing?

660
00:51:57,613 --> 00:52:00,482
Okay, um...

661
00:52:01,817 --> 00:52:04,419
Dear god, thank you

662
00:52:04,787 --> 00:52:06,121
for...

663
00:52:06,489 --> 00:52:07,689
Um...

664
00:52:09,592 --> 00:52:12,660
God Grant us the Serenity,

665
00:52:12,662 --> 00:52:14,696
to accept the things
we cannot change,

666
00:52:14,698 --> 00:52:17,332
the courage to change
the things we can

667
00:52:17,334 --> 00:52:19,200
and the wisdom
to know the difference.

668
00:52:19,802 --> 00:52:20,869
Amen.

669
00:52:20,871 --> 00:52:22,670
Amen.

670
00:52:24,807 --> 00:52:28,309
So, Ben, what happened
with you and your boyfriend?

671
00:52:30,412 --> 00:52:31,613
It didn't work out.

672
00:52:35,151 --> 00:52:37,886
Why is it that gay
relationships never last long?

673
00:52:40,256 --> 00:52:44,559
Well, it turns out that
George had a wife and kids.

674
00:52:44,561 --> 00:52:47,595
Nothing ruins a gay relationship
faster than a wife and kids.

675
00:52:51,267 --> 00:52:54,569
No, but, you know,
what I mean, I mean...

676
00:52:54,571 --> 00:52:57,872
You guys are always running
around having sex with each other

677
00:52:57,874 --> 00:53:00,308
in public bathrooms,
truck stops.

678
00:53:02,444 --> 00:53:06,614
When straight people have sex
in public places like the...

679
00:53:06,616 --> 00:53:08,917
Backseat of the car
on the beach,

680
00:53:08,919 --> 00:53:11,653
society turns it into a
Norman Rockwell painting.

681
00:53:12,621 --> 00:53:15,190
Well, beaches are romantic.

682
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:16,691
Truck stops aren't.

683
00:53:16,693 --> 00:53:20,662
Why is it okay for nurses or
teachers to be objects of desire,

684
00:53:20,664 --> 00:53:22,363
but not truck drivers?

685
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:25,366
It all depends on what
you label as normal.

686
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:28,536
Are you complaining that
gays have sex in public?

687
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:30,638
Or do you just not like the
public places they pick?

688
00:53:34,710 --> 00:53:36,711
Um...

689
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:39,480
I think it's a good thing
that, uh...

690
00:53:39,482 --> 00:53:41,883
You found out about George's
wife and his children.

691
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:44,586
If he would do that to them,

692
00:53:44,588 --> 00:53:45,653
he'd do it to you.

693
00:53:53,596 --> 00:53:54,729
Thanks for coming.

694
00:53:55,664 --> 00:53:57,632
Yeah, it was a good time.

695
00:53:57,634 --> 00:53:59,968
Damn, I forgot my sunglasses.

696
00:53:59,970 --> 00:54:01,369
Oh.

697
00:54:02,938 --> 00:54:05,807
So, uh, fishing tomorrow?

698
00:54:05,809 --> 00:54:07,475
Absolutely.
All right.

699
00:54:09,245 --> 00:54:10,745
Where are the trash bags?

700
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:11,846
I'll get 'em.

701
00:54:11,848 --> 00:54:12,914
Thanks.

702
00:54:22,591 --> 00:54:23,925
It was a good day.

703
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:25,360
Good to see you again.

704
00:54:27,429 --> 00:54:28,496
Yeah.

705
00:54:31,033 --> 00:54:33,568
Look, uh, thanks for what
you said about my hearing.

706
00:54:37,506 --> 00:54:38,606
Really appreciate it.

707
00:54:38,608 --> 00:54:39,674
You're welcome.

708
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:58,826
I got 'em.

709
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:05,667
Well, let's go.

710
00:55:20,983 --> 00:55:22,050
Hey.

711
00:55:27,423 --> 00:55:29,324
How are sales?
Did you have a good day?

712
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:31,059
No.

713
00:55:31,061 --> 00:55:32,927
I'm hoping it picks up soon.

714
00:55:34,663 --> 00:55:36,964
Anyway, I'm too happy to care.

715
00:55:38,634 --> 00:55:39,914
So, did you have fun at Chuck's?

716
00:55:40,336 --> 00:55:41,969
Yeah.

717
00:55:41,971 --> 00:55:43,738
Kept thinking
about that guy, Lee.

718
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:44,906
I don't know what
to make of him.

719
00:55:44,908 --> 00:55:46,341
What do you mean?

720
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:48,676
I mean, he's not just
like a typical loser,

721
00:55:48,678 --> 00:55:48,676
he's like more complicated
than that.

722
00:55:48,678 --> 00:55:52,747
Why do you feel like you have
to put him into a category?

723
00:55:52,749 --> 00:55:55,450
I'm not putting him
into a category.

724
00:55:55,452 --> 00:55:59,354
But he is an alcoholic and a felon, you
don't just ignore something like that.

725
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:01,823
Well, you don't have
to ignore it, but...

726
00:56:01,825 --> 00:56:04,492
You don't have to define
him by it either.

727
00:56:04,494 --> 00:56:07,128
I hope I'm not defined by the
worst thing that I had ever done.

728
00:56:15,971 --> 00:56:18,005
Chuck's cabin was rustic.

729
00:56:18,007 --> 00:56:19,640
Come on out with it.

730
00:56:19,642 --> 00:56:20,808
What do you wanna say?

731
00:56:21,777 --> 00:56:24,579
Do you realize that Chuck makes

732
00:56:24,581 --> 00:56:26,814
less than $12,000 a year?

733
00:56:26,816 --> 00:56:28,816
I haven't analyzed it that much,

734
00:56:28,818 --> 00:56:30,918
well, don't you think
maybe you should?

735
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:33,788
Well, I do all right, I get by.

736
00:56:33,790 --> 00:56:37,825
Have you thought about living in that
two room cabin with no running water?

737
00:56:37,827 --> 00:56:41,095
I like Chuck, but he doesn't
care about earning a living.

738
00:56:41,097 --> 00:56:43,798
He wants to live in the
woods away from everyone.

739
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:46,634
You know you two don't
have that much in common.

740
00:56:46,636 --> 00:56:49,871
And he's not gonna turn
into someone else later.

741
00:56:49,873 --> 00:56:52,707
Easy to romanticize everything
now, when you're all infatuated,

742
00:56:52,709 --> 00:56:54,609
but what about
five years from now

743
00:56:54,611 --> 00:56:57,612
when you can't pay the bills and
you're in a cabin with no water

744
00:56:57,614 --> 00:57:00,748
and he's on a week long hike with his
buddies. Have you thought about that?

745
00:57:01,717 --> 00:57:03,050
Wouldn't be like that.

746
00:57:03,052 --> 00:57:04,986
It'd be just like that.

747
00:57:05,954 --> 00:57:07,155
So, what are you saying?

748
00:57:08,457 --> 00:57:10,057
I don't know.

749
00:57:10,059 --> 00:57:13,161
I'm just saying, maybe you should
think about things like that.

750
00:58:10,719 --> 00:58:11,953
Morning.

751
00:58:12,888 --> 00:58:13,955
Hey.

752
00:58:17,726 --> 00:58:21,829
This is a little awkward, um, you remember
when I ran into you at Chuck's cabin?

753
00:58:21,831 --> 00:58:24,131
Right after that,
I, uh, find your journal.

754
00:58:25,701 --> 00:58:28,069
You know, I was wondering
where I lost that.

755
00:58:28,071 --> 00:58:30,938
Yeah and then I meant it to
give it back to you, but, um...

756
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:34,008
For some reason, I didn't think I should
give it back to you in front of Cathy.

757
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:36,744
I mean I didn't read or anything, so I
don't even know if it talks about her,

758
00:58:36,746 --> 00:58:39,180
but I imagine since
it's a journal.

759
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:41,549
And then, I forgot I had it.

760
00:58:41,551 --> 00:58:43,084
And then, when I
remembered when I had it,

761
00:58:43,086 --> 00:58:45,052
then I thought that you
would think I just went...

762
00:58:46,522 --> 00:58:49,056
But I didn't read it
or anything.

763
00:58:49,058 --> 00:58:52,660
But I read a little bit of
it, but nothing bad, just...

764
00:58:52,662 --> 00:58:54,028
You know, personal stuff.

765
00:58:56,532 --> 00:58:58,165
Anyway, um, there it is.

766
00:59:00,769 --> 00:59:02,203
Just some personal stuff.

767
00:59:03,105 --> 00:59:04,572
Yeah, just...

768
00:59:06,642 --> 00:59:08,943
It must be a guy being
too hard on himself.

769
00:59:16,051 --> 00:59:18,219
I'm thinking about going
hiking, later today.

770
00:59:20,956 --> 00:59:22,790
Where are you gonna go?

771
00:59:22,792 --> 00:59:24,759
Up to Wolverine Ridge.

772
00:59:24,761 --> 00:59:27,194
Wolverine Ridge, isn't
that past green cove?

773
00:59:27,196 --> 00:59:28,896
Yeah. Yeah, I
haven't been there.

774
00:59:34,903 --> 00:59:37,263
Well, I could get my car and
then I'd follow you over there.

775
00:59:38,941 --> 00:59:40,041
That sounds like a plan.

776
00:59:40,776 --> 00:59:41,909
Cool.

777
01:00:18,347 --> 01:00:20,915
So, when did you start drinking?

778
01:00:20,917 --> 01:00:23,351
I don't know...
High school, I guess...

779
01:00:26,054 --> 01:00:28,155
My dad's an alcoholic.

780
01:00:28,157 --> 01:00:30,958
He'd go to the office
everyday, but...

781
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:33,160
He'd get home at five,
usually passed out by seven.

782
01:00:34,663 --> 01:00:36,030
Sleep for two hours.

783
01:00:38,133 --> 01:00:40,901
Throw up, eat something,
get drunk again.

784
01:00:43,171 --> 01:00:45,640
He was angry, mean.

785
01:00:46,375 --> 01:00:49,176
Not physically,
but psychologically.

786
01:00:50,746 --> 01:00:53,848
Our mother, spent her time

787
01:00:53,850 --> 01:00:55,650
pretending
there wasn't a problem.

788
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:57,785
I just stayed in my room
a lot, the door shut.

789
01:01:00,322 --> 01:01:01,922
Even call me recluse.

790
01:01:02,824 --> 01:01:04,725
Sissy.

791
01:01:04,727 --> 01:01:08,295
I never understood
the demons he was fighting.

792
01:01:08,297 --> 01:01:10,164
I don't think he
understands 'em either.

793
01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:12,099
I know that now, but...

794
01:01:12,101 --> 01:01:13,901
When I was 13, I just hated him.

795
01:01:17,773 --> 01:01:19,206
So, why do you drink?

796
01:01:19,208 --> 01:01:20,441
Hell, I don't know.

797
01:01:24,046 --> 01:01:26,313
Like you said, demons.

798
01:01:29,885 --> 01:01:31,986
There's things about me I hate.

799
01:01:33,321 --> 01:01:34,955
Things I can't understand.

800
01:01:48,003 --> 01:01:49,170
It's granite.

801
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:53,240
It's all over the place up here.

802
01:01:54,910 --> 01:01:57,211
How do you know that?

803
01:01:57,213 --> 01:01:59,246
Studied geology before I
dropped out of college.

804
01:02:06,188 --> 01:02:08,155
We should head back.

805
01:02:43,759 --> 01:02:44,892
Have a good one.

806
01:02:44,894 --> 01:02:46,393
You want to get
something to eat?

807
01:02:51,032 --> 01:02:52,272
Where do you think about going?

808
01:02:53,268 --> 01:02:55,336
I don't care...
The diner.

809
01:03:01,009 --> 01:03:02,076
All right.

810
01:03:04,212 --> 01:03:05,312
I'll see you there.

811
01:03:21,897 --> 01:03:22,963
I gotta go.

812
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:26,801
Okay, it's all right.

813
01:03:29,905 --> 01:03:31,172
I had a good time.

814
01:04:15,517 --> 01:04:16,917
Hi, honey.

815
01:04:16,919 --> 01:04:17,985
Hi.

816
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:26,994
He's still not here?

817
01:04:26,996 --> 01:04:28,262
No.

818
01:04:28,264 --> 01:04:29,430
That's unusual.

819
01:04:31,299 --> 01:04:34,101
Guess he got held up somewhere.

820
01:04:34,103 --> 01:04:37,004
I'm gonna go finish these,
get them delivered.

821
01:04:48,483 --> 01:04:50,150
Sorry for standing you up.

822
01:04:54,589 --> 01:04:56,523
What's wrong?
You okay?

823
01:04:58,560 --> 01:05:00,327
Jane told me,
it isn't working out.

824
01:05:00,329 --> 01:05:01,462
Why did she say that?

825
01:05:01,464 --> 01:05:02,997
She came up here last night.

826
01:05:04,499 --> 01:05:05,566
Why?

827
01:05:06,167 --> 01:05:07,301
She didn't say.

828
01:05:12,608 --> 01:05:16,176
Trying to act like my breath
had been knocked out of me.

829
01:05:17,279 --> 01:05:18,979
I don't understand.

830
01:05:18,981 --> 01:05:21,348
I've been sitting here all day.

831
01:05:21,350 --> 01:05:23,584
Trying to convince myself
that it doesn't matter.

832
01:05:23,586 --> 01:05:26,353
That it wouldn't have
worked anyway.

833
01:05:26,355 --> 01:05:28,315
Couldn't believe she actually
had feelings for me.

834
01:05:29,090 --> 01:05:30,190
I guess she didn't.

835
01:05:34,362 --> 01:05:36,063
I just can't stop
thinking about her.

836
01:06:45,467 --> 01:06:47,735
Hello, can I help you?

837
01:06:47,737 --> 01:06:51,605
Yeah, my name's Lee Darcy,
I'm here to see Ben Bennett.

838
01:06:51,607 --> 01:06:53,340
Is he expecting you?

839
01:06:53,342 --> 01:06:55,209
No.

840
01:06:55,211 --> 01:06:58,145
Well, he's in a conference right
now, but I think he'll be out soon.

841
01:06:58,147 --> 01:06:59,787
You can have a seat
if you'd like to wait.

842
01:07:00,448 --> 01:07:01,515
Thank you.

843
01:07:20,301 --> 01:07:22,269
I'm sorry I just dropped
in on you like this.

844
01:07:22,271 --> 01:07:25,239
I just really needed
someone to talk to.

845
01:07:25,241 --> 01:07:29,743
I know. It's hard right now, but
in the end you'll see. All right?

846
01:07:29,745 --> 01:07:34,681
Chuck's a great guy, but he's never
going to make anything of himself.

847
01:07:34,683 --> 01:07:36,283
You'll just have
to keep that in mind.

848
01:07:38,420 --> 01:07:39,520
I know.

849
01:07:50,665 --> 01:07:52,299
I'll call you, okay?

850
01:08:01,676 --> 01:08:04,745
Ben,
Lee Darcy is here to see you.

851
01:08:07,415 --> 01:08:12,586
Came by to see if you could help me figure
out why Jane decided to break up with Chuck.

852
01:08:14,656 --> 01:08:16,223
Guess I got my answer.

853
01:08:19,094 --> 01:08:20,794
My first impressions
of you were right.

854
01:08:22,230 --> 01:08:24,131
You're just another
pretentious faggot.

855
01:08:45,453 --> 01:08:47,488
Oh, hi, Ben.

856
01:08:47,490 --> 01:08:50,390
Where are they,
the criminal files?

857
01:08:50,392 --> 01:08:51,658
Uh, they're under the counter.

858
01:09:32,634 --> 01:09:34,434
So, what's this about?

859
01:09:36,337 --> 01:09:39,406
I understand that you witnessed
an incident between Lee Darcy

860
01:09:39,408 --> 01:09:40,641
and his girlfriend, Cathy?

861
01:09:44,379 --> 01:09:47,347
Yes, I did.

862
01:09:47,349 --> 01:09:50,617
According to the court file, you said
that Lee said he was gonna kill her

863
01:09:50,619 --> 01:09:51,685
and then he pushed her.

864
01:09:52,921 --> 01:09:55,322
Well, I never said
I saw him push her.

865
01:09:55,324 --> 01:09:58,492
I said he must've pushed her,
because I heard them arguing,

866
01:09:58,494 --> 01:09:59,626
and she fell and hit her head.

867
01:09:59,628 --> 01:10:02,563
So, he must've pushed her.

868
01:10:02,565 --> 01:10:06,233
Did you tell the police officer
that he said he was gonna kill her?

869
01:10:15,343 --> 01:10:16,810
Yes, I said that.

870
01:10:21,349 --> 01:10:23,217
Is that what you heard?

871
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:25,819
What's this about?
I thought this was over.

872
01:10:25,821 --> 01:10:27,888
I'm just looking into it,
for a friend of Lee's.

873
01:10:30,291 --> 01:10:31,758
Well...

874
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:36,330
Suppose I didn't
exactly hear those words...

875
01:10:36,332 --> 01:10:38,799
I mean, suppose the...

876
01:10:38,801 --> 01:10:42,536
Statement I gave
wasn't completely accurate.

877
01:10:42,538 --> 01:10:44,698
I could get into a lot of
trouble for that, couldn't I?

878
01:10:45,773 --> 01:10:48,508
Yes.

879
01:10:48,510 --> 01:10:51,350
But you do recognize that Lee doesn't
remember what happened that night.

880
01:10:53,381 --> 01:10:55,816
His felony conviction is based
solely on your testimony.

881
01:10:57,986 --> 01:11:00,621
Would it make a difference if it
turns out I went to Lee's attorney

882
01:11:00,623 --> 01:11:02,956
about it and he ignored me?

883
01:11:04,626 --> 01:11:05,692
It might.

884
01:11:11,332 --> 01:11:15,269
Let me guess, you're back on
the court-appointed list?

885
01:11:15,271 --> 01:11:17,571
Do you remember the case you
had when you first got here?

886
01:11:17,573 --> 01:11:20,774
Yeah, what was her name, Diane?
I was certain she was innocent.

887
01:11:22,677 --> 01:11:24,044
That was 12 years ago.

888
01:11:24,946 --> 01:11:26,947
So, what's up?

889
01:11:26,949 --> 01:11:29,349
You prosecuted a guy
named Lee Darcy,

890
01:11:29,351 --> 01:11:31,551
for aggravated malicious
wounding.

891
01:11:31,553 --> 01:11:34,621
And Lee was charged with a felony
based on a testimony of a neighbor,

892
01:11:34,623 --> 01:11:36,857
who said that Lee threatened
to kill his girlfriend.

893
01:11:36,859 --> 01:11:38,025
Yeah, I remember it.

894
01:11:39,027 --> 01:11:40,994
Well, there's a possibility...

895
01:11:40,996 --> 01:11:44,298
That that neighbor would
recant her statement.

896
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:46,433
So, that happens all the time,

897
01:11:46,435 --> 01:11:49,703
there's not really anything
to be done about that.

898
01:11:49,705 --> 01:11:53,407
What if the neighbor told Lee's
attorney her testimony was false?

899
01:11:54,042 --> 01:11:55,776
And, uh...

900
01:11:55,778 --> 01:11:57,611
The attorney admitted
that to me?

901
01:11:57,613 --> 01:11:59,813
Well, that's
a different story, but...

902
01:11:59,815 --> 01:12:02,616
Why doesn't Darcy's attorney
just reopen the case?

903
01:12:03,084 --> 01:12:04,584
Who is his attorney?

904
01:12:05,553 --> 01:12:06,687
George Wickham.

905
01:12:09,424 --> 01:12:10,490
Hmmm.

906
01:12:11,793 --> 01:12:14,628
Well, I think we might've
talked more about this.

907
01:12:23,738 --> 01:12:24,805
Can I help you?

908
01:12:25,973 --> 01:12:29,009
Ben Bennett, I'm here
to see, George Wickham.

909
01:12:29,011 --> 01:12:31,678
You just wait in here. He'll
be here in just a moment.

910
01:12:43,391 --> 01:12:44,558
Ben.

911
01:12:44,959 --> 01:12:46,660
Great to see you.

912
01:12:48,996 --> 01:12:50,497
Step outside.

913
01:12:53,568 --> 01:12:54,935
Look, I understand
why you're mad.

914
01:12:54,937 --> 01:12:57,097
I should've leveled with you
about my situation, but...

915
01:12:57,605 --> 01:12:59,773
I really fell hard for you.

916
01:12:59,775 --> 01:13:03,877
I was afraid you wouldn't see
me under those circumstances.

917
01:13:03,879 --> 01:13:06,546
Honestly, I'm hoping you're
here to give us another chance.

918
01:13:06,548 --> 01:13:08,882
You are some piece
of work, aren't you?

919
01:13:08,884 --> 01:13:13,887
You refer to your wife
and children as a situation?

920
01:13:13,889 --> 01:13:15,929
That little boy's gonna be
so proud of you, one day.

921
01:13:17,125 --> 01:13:18,592
So, why are you here?

922
01:13:22,430 --> 01:13:25,132
You're gonna file a writ of
actual innocence for Lee Darcy.

923
01:13:25,134 --> 01:13:26,400
What?

924
01:13:27,168 --> 01:13:28,602
Lee Darcy?

925
01:13:29,003 --> 01:13:30,504
Why would I do that?

926
01:13:31,105 --> 01:13:32,973
It's pretty simple.

927
01:13:32,975 --> 01:13:36,576
Lee's neighbor told you her testimony
was false. You ignored her.

928
01:13:36,578 --> 01:13:38,145
You breached your duty
to defend Lee,

929
01:13:38,147 --> 01:13:40,614
because you see him as
nothing more than a thief.

930
01:13:40,616 --> 01:13:42,983
You told me all this while
screwing around on your wife,

931
01:13:42,985 --> 01:13:45,752
you lied to her, you lied to me.

932
01:13:45,754 --> 01:13:48,922
You stabbed the commonwealth
attorney in the back.

933
01:13:48,924 --> 01:13:51,458
Now, the neighbor's going
to testify against you.

934
01:13:51,460 --> 01:13:53,760
The commonwealth is going
to give her immunity

935
01:13:53,762 --> 01:13:55,729
and I'll just report you
to the state bar.

936
01:13:56,931 --> 01:13:58,899
If you actually do
the right thing now.

937
01:13:58,901 --> 01:14:00,801
I only lose
your license for a year.

938
01:14:00,803 --> 01:14:03,036
Otherwise, I'll make sure you
never practice law again.

939
01:14:07,175 --> 01:14:09,142
Lee came to see me.

940
01:14:09,144 --> 01:14:10,577
Yeah, about what?

941
01:14:11,579 --> 01:14:12,846
About Chuck.

942
01:14:12,848 --> 01:14:14,114
Chuck?

943
01:14:14,116 --> 01:14:15,649
What'd he say?

944
01:14:16,017 --> 01:14:17,217
Not much.

945
01:14:18,786 --> 01:14:20,020
Um, he didn't have to.

946
01:14:21,556 --> 01:14:23,790
Basically,
Chuck is broken hearted.

947
01:14:23,792 --> 01:14:26,660
And I'm a pretentious queer who
should've minded his own business.

948
01:14:27,728 --> 01:14:29,629
He's right.

949
01:14:29,631 --> 01:14:32,199
But what you said,
made a lot of sense.

950
01:14:32,201 --> 01:14:34,167
No, it really doesn't, Jane.

951
01:14:36,704 --> 01:14:39,172
Look, I judged Chuck
based on his paycheck.

952
01:14:39,174 --> 01:14:41,041
I concluded
he's wasting his life.

953
01:14:41,976 --> 01:14:43,710
The truth is, what am I doing?

954
01:14:45,780 --> 01:14:49,082
There was this guy in school
that had a bumper sticker that,

955
01:14:49,084 --> 01:14:51,485
"guy who dies
with the most toys, wins."

956
01:14:53,087 --> 01:14:55,127
That's what I'm doing,
that's my plan for happiness.

957
01:14:56,691 --> 01:14:59,726
Sounds so pathetic
to say it out loud.

958
01:14:59,728 --> 01:15:01,495
What are you talking about?

959
01:15:07,502 --> 01:15:08,635
I'm talking about Chuck.

960
01:15:10,104 --> 01:15:11,204
He loves you.

961
01:15:12,773 --> 01:15:13,907
You love him.

962
01:15:14,976 --> 01:15:16,977
How often does that happen?

963
01:15:19,247 --> 01:15:21,781
Look, I'm an idiot.

964
01:15:31,526 --> 01:15:33,126
You were right about one thing.

965
01:15:34,729 --> 01:15:37,764
You are an idiot.

966
01:15:53,314 --> 01:15:55,015
Let's go hike
to top of the Ridge.

967
01:15:56,584 --> 01:15:58,051
Yeah, I appreciate you
checking on me,

968
01:15:58,053 --> 01:15:59,953
but I don't feel like
doing anything.

969
01:15:59,955 --> 01:16:02,822
I know I need to snap out of this,
but it's going to take some time.

970
01:16:05,159 --> 01:16:06,693
You expecting anybody?

971
01:16:11,132 --> 01:16:12,632
It's Jane.

972
01:16:16,003 --> 01:16:17,070
How do I look?

973
01:16:18,606 --> 01:16:19,940
You look like hammered shit.

974
01:16:22,878 --> 01:16:24,177
You look fine, man.

975
01:16:25,346 --> 01:16:26,646
Hey.

976
01:16:27,582 --> 01:16:28,682
Hey.

977
01:16:30,851 --> 01:16:32,319
You'll be okay.

978
01:16:33,354 --> 01:16:35,355
I'm gonna get going.

979
01:16:35,357 --> 01:16:36,856
Give you a call tomorrow, Chuck.

980
01:16:36,858 --> 01:16:37,924
Okay.

981
01:16:42,063 --> 01:16:43,129
Hey.

982
01:16:43,331 --> 01:16:44,598
Hey.

983
01:16:52,039 --> 01:16:54,307
Just came by
to tell you, I'm sorry.

984
01:17:20,968 --> 01:17:22,636
What is it?

985
01:17:22,638 --> 01:17:23,770
I don't know.

986
01:17:24,739 --> 01:17:26,006
Seems to be a notice.

987
01:17:27,875 --> 01:17:30,276
There's a hearing
on my case on Tuesday.

988
01:17:35,416 --> 01:17:37,183
I thought your case was over.

989
01:17:42,289 --> 01:17:44,124
So, your testimony is that...

990
01:17:44,126 --> 01:17:47,127
Lee Darcy did not threaten
to kill Cathy Burge.

991
01:17:47,129 --> 01:17:47,127
That is correct.

992
01:17:47,129 --> 01:17:51,398
And you informed, Mr. Wickham of
this, more than five months ago?

993
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:52,666
Yes.

994
01:17:53,300 --> 01:17:54,401
You may go.

995
01:18:01,776 --> 01:18:03,677
Based on the evidence presented,

996
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:06,346
the court dismisses
its previous order

997
01:18:06,348 --> 01:18:09,082
and the felony conviction
of Lee Darcy is vacated.

998
01:18:09,850 --> 01:18:11,217
We stand adjourned.

999
01:18:12,119 --> 01:18:13,453
All rise.

1000
01:18:14,355 --> 01:18:16,322
Mr. Wickham.

1001
01:18:16,324 --> 01:18:20,360
I anticipate you'll have some
explaining to do to the state bar.

1002
01:18:20,362 --> 01:18:22,429
I suggest you find
a good attorney.

1003
01:18:22,431 --> 01:18:24,731
One who actually
cares about their clients.

1004
01:18:31,806 --> 01:18:33,139
What just happened?

1005
01:18:33,141 --> 01:18:36,242
Congratulations,
court cleared your record.

1006
01:18:38,245 --> 01:18:39,446
Thank you.

1007
01:18:40,047 --> 01:18:41,781
Save it.

1008
01:18:41,783 --> 01:18:44,851
Ben Bennett moved heaven and
earth for your worthless ass.

1009
01:18:51,325 --> 01:18:53,159
He must really
have it bad for you.

1010
01:19:31,065 --> 01:19:32,899
Ben...

1011
01:19:32,901 --> 01:19:35,435
Where in the hell were you?

1012
01:19:35,936 --> 01:19:37,937
I knew it.

1013
01:19:37,939 --> 01:19:42,008
Didn't I tell you, you missed the
reception to sit around and push papers?

1014
01:19:42,010 --> 01:19:43,510
Pathetic.

1015
01:19:43,512 --> 01:19:45,979
Why didn't you tell us
you weren't coming?

1016
01:19:45,981 --> 01:19:48,014
Rainey Daniels was there.

1017
01:19:48,016 --> 01:19:49,516
He's hotter than a firecracker,

1018
01:19:49,518 --> 01:19:51,017
pow, pack-a-pow.

1019
01:19:52,386 --> 01:19:54,521
Don't waste your time,
Ben isn't interested.

1020
01:19:54,523 --> 01:19:56,890
Ben's never gonna fall
in love again, are you Ben?

1021
01:20:00,895 --> 01:20:02,328
What is it?

1022
01:20:02,330 --> 01:20:03,429
What's wrong?

1023
01:20:16,076 --> 01:20:17,544
You must've dropped this.

1024
01:20:27,521 --> 01:20:29,522
Thought I'd catch you
before you went in.

1025
01:20:30,324 --> 01:20:31,491
You're up early.

1026
01:20:32,193 --> 01:20:33,293
I still have work.

1027
01:20:34,528 --> 01:20:35,595
Right.

1028
01:20:37,431 --> 01:20:42,468
Look, I'm not really good
at this, um...

1029
01:20:42,470 --> 01:20:44,838
Really appreciate what you did
for me at the courthouse.

1030
01:20:46,540 --> 01:20:47,941
You're welcome.

1031
01:20:50,311 --> 01:20:51,444
Also...

1032
01:20:53,480 --> 01:20:55,548
I'm really sorry
about what I said

1033
01:20:55,550 --> 01:20:57,116
at your office, the other day.

1034
01:20:58,152 --> 01:20:59,219
It's all right.

1035
01:21:02,456 --> 01:21:03,623
So, what happens now?

1036
01:21:07,161 --> 01:21:08,394
Um...

1037
01:21:11,232 --> 01:21:13,399
My buddy called from Atlanta,

1038
01:21:13,401 --> 01:21:15,134
that job is still available.

1039
01:21:16,503 --> 01:21:19,405
I don't have a record now,
so I can leave the state.

1040
01:21:19,407 --> 01:21:21,007
He says it starts next Monday.

1041
01:21:25,613 --> 01:21:28,548
So, I guess I won't be
seeing much of you.

1042
01:21:33,921 --> 01:21:37,490
Yeah, I'm gonna...
I should get back.

1043
01:23:01,241 --> 01:23:04,110
There's a Cathy Burge
here to see you.

1044
01:23:05,612 --> 01:23:06,713
Thanks.

1045
01:23:20,094 --> 01:23:21,227
Hello.

1046
01:23:24,732 --> 01:23:28,201
I guess all these books are
supposed to show how smart you are.

1047
01:23:30,104 --> 01:23:32,171
Probably so.

1048
01:23:32,173 --> 01:23:33,573
Is there something
I can do for you?

1049
01:23:35,576 --> 01:23:38,444
No, is there something
I can do for you?

1050
01:23:38,446 --> 01:23:40,713
Don't pretend you don't
know why I'm here.

1051
01:23:40,715 --> 01:23:43,249
I honestly have no idea.

1052
01:23:43,251 --> 01:23:46,285
I know what you're doing. I
know exactly what you're doing.

1053
01:23:46,653 --> 01:23:48,187
What am I doing?

1054
01:23:49,223 --> 01:23:51,224
You don't think I've noticed?

1055
01:23:51,226 --> 01:23:53,259
Why you been working on Lee?

1056
01:23:53,261 --> 01:23:55,328
Trying to worm
your way into his life?

1057
01:23:55,330 --> 01:23:58,664
I mean, it's been disgusting to
watch the little love-sick queer

1058
01:23:58,666 --> 01:24:00,466
make a fool out of himself.

1059
01:24:04,638 --> 01:24:06,272
What do you want?

1060
01:24:06,274 --> 01:24:08,174
I want you to leave Lee alone.

1061
01:24:08,176 --> 01:24:10,410
I want you stay away
from my boyfriend!

1062
01:24:21,722 --> 01:24:23,489
This is ridiculous.

1063
01:24:25,292 --> 01:24:28,428
The very idea of a
red-blooded guy like Lee

1064
01:24:28,430 --> 01:24:31,297
having any interest
in a sissy boy like you.

1065
01:24:33,167 --> 01:24:34,567
If you believe
it's so ridiculous,

1066
01:24:34,569 --> 01:24:36,202
I wonder why
you bothered coming here.

1067
01:24:38,105 --> 01:24:40,173
Oh, honey, trust me.

1068
01:24:40,175 --> 01:24:42,642
Lee isn't a queer.

1069
01:24:42,644 --> 01:24:45,411
Does he really think
you give a shit about him?

1070
01:24:47,181 --> 01:24:50,183
You think you can brainwash him
just like those Aa people?

1071
01:24:50,185 --> 01:24:51,784
They acted like
they cared about him.

1072
01:24:51,786 --> 01:24:54,353
Got him to think all kinds
of crazy things, too.

1073
01:24:55,656 --> 01:24:58,858
You're doing
the exact same thing.

1074
01:24:58,860 --> 01:25:02,195
I know it was you that got
Lee's record cleared, somehow.

1075
01:25:02,197 --> 01:25:04,197
Lee told me you did it.

1076
01:25:04,199 --> 01:25:06,499
I did it. I'm glad
I was able to help him.

1077
01:25:06,501 --> 01:25:08,167
Help him?

1078
01:25:08,169 --> 01:25:10,536
Is that what you call it?

1079
01:25:10,538 --> 01:25:13,239
Oh, I know what you're up to,
even if he doesn't see it yet.

1080
01:25:13,807 --> 01:25:15,274
What am I up to?

1081
01:25:15,276 --> 01:25:16,876
Brainwashing him

1082
01:25:16,878 --> 01:25:20,246
into not taking
that job in Atlanta.

1083
01:25:20,248 --> 01:25:24,484
Making him think
he has feelings for you.

1084
01:25:24,486 --> 01:25:28,221
Making him think he's some
kind of fag like you.

1085
01:25:28,822 --> 01:25:30,790
Well, he's not!

1086
01:25:30,792 --> 01:25:33,593
So, your little plan isn't going
to work, I'm going to see to that.

1087
01:25:35,329 --> 01:25:36,796
You said he has feelings for me?

1088
01:25:38,765 --> 01:25:39,866
Go to hell.

1089
01:27:52,499 --> 01:27:53,566
Hey.

1090
01:28:07,381 --> 01:28:08,614
It's a great day for a hike.

1091
01:28:09,483 --> 01:28:11,450
Yeah, it is.

1092
01:28:11,452 --> 01:28:13,652
Cathy said you're not going
to take that job in Atlanta.

1093
01:28:14,721 --> 01:28:15,955
That's right.

1094
01:28:15,957 --> 01:28:17,023
Why?

1095
01:28:18,025 --> 01:28:19,392
I don't know.

1096
01:28:20,661 --> 01:28:23,529
That's not much of an answer.

1097
01:28:23,531 --> 01:28:25,931
Look, I didn't mean to cause
problems for you and Cathy.

1098
01:28:28,368 --> 01:28:30,069
You didn't.

1099
01:28:30,071 --> 01:28:32,038
We're not together, but
it's not because of you.

1100
01:28:33,640 --> 01:28:34,940
She came to the office.

1101
01:28:34,942 --> 01:28:36,809
Um, she was pretty upset.

1102
01:28:37,911 --> 01:28:39,679
Yeah, I know about that.

1103
01:28:39,681 --> 01:28:41,681
And she was very upset.

1104
01:28:46,353 --> 01:28:47,586
She accused me of...

1105
01:28:48,822 --> 01:28:50,456
Trying to take you
away from her.

1106
01:28:53,393 --> 01:28:54,527
That's crazy.

1107
01:28:54,529 --> 01:28:55,594
Is it?

1108
01:28:55,929 --> 01:28:56,996
Yeah.

1109
01:29:00,067 --> 01:29:01,834
I think you misread signals

1110
01:29:01,836 --> 01:29:02,968
or something.

1111
01:29:04,404 --> 01:29:06,072
Cathy said you had
feelings for me.

1112
01:29:07,107 --> 01:29:08,407
She's wrong.

1113
01:29:10,110 --> 01:29:11,477
Those are her issues.

1114
01:29:11,945 --> 01:29:13,346
I'm not gay.

1115
01:29:14,715 --> 01:29:16,615
I'm just trying
to be nice to you,

1116
01:29:16,617 --> 01:29:18,951
because you helped me out,
that's all.

1117
01:29:20,887 --> 01:29:22,722
I don't wanna talk
about this anymore.

1118
01:29:28,829 --> 01:29:29,929
I love you.

1119
01:29:29,931 --> 01:29:31,731
Will you just stop it?

1120
01:29:31,733 --> 01:29:32,965
I'm not like that!

1121
01:29:34,501 --> 01:29:35,601
I'm not like you.

1122
01:29:46,413 --> 01:29:47,713
I'm sorry.

1123
01:29:49,716 --> 01:29:50,883
I've gotta go.
