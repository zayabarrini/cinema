1
00:00:43,277 --> 00:00:51,006
AND THE SHIP SAILS ON

2
00:04:01,754 --> 00:04:04,549
They tell me: "Do the news,
tell what happens!"

3
00:04:04,721 --> 00:04:06,880
And who the hell knows
what happens?

4
00:04:36,789 --> 00:04:39,550
Whoever might have accidentally
wandered onto Pier Number 10

5
00:04:39,723 --> 00:04:41,985
one July morning of 1914 would
have seen that...

6
00:06:38,196 --> 00:06:40,719
I must hand over the ashes
of Edmea Tetua

7
00:06:48,196 --> 00:06:49,389
Mr. Partexano!

8
00:06:58,564 --> 00:07:01,587
Permission to bring the ashes
of Edmea Tetua aboard

9
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:05,396
- Permission granted.
- On the broadside!

10
00:12:35,781 --> 00:12:39,270
- What are you doing, Monica?
- It's very hot, Mommy!

11
00:12:39,582 --> 00:12:40,945
Wait for it to cool!

12
00:12:42,315 --> 00:12:45,440
Even if my husband agreed,
it doesn't mean anything

13
00:12:45,982 --> 00:12:49,778
My husband is a great artist.
But don't get mad, darling...

14
00:12:50,082 --> 00:12:51,479
he's simply a child
in business matters

15
00:12:51,682 --> 00:12:54,614
I wouldn't say so. However, I'm
here to defend your interests

16
00:12:54,749 --> 00:12:57,614
That's not true! You didn't act
on his behalf in that contract!

17
00:12:57,782 --> 00:12:59,749
And I'll tell you why.
First:

18
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:02,879
advertising. It's not
to his advantage

19
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:08,378
Change the soprano, she's more
prominent than my husband

20
00:13:08,683 --> 00:13:12,581
Charity or not, I won't appear
before a stupid bunch of kids

21
00:13:12,716 --> 00:13:15,444
I'm Ricotin, a sophisticated
comic!

22
00:13:15,584 --> 00:13:17,106
Children are not my audience!

23
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:19,375
- Intellectuals appreciate me!
- That's what you think, darling!

24
00:13:19,584 --> 00:13:22,482
Your last reviews
were disastrous

25
00:13:22,717 --> 00:13:26,342
- Gilbert the French critic...
- Comply with your contract!

26
00:13:26,817 --> 00:13:29,409
You're here to advertise my
film, nothing else!

27
00:13:31,485 --> 00:13:33,882
Well, the Hindus around
Bombay say,

28
00:13:35,385 --> 00:13:37,010
even though I don't know
if it's true or not,

29
00:13:37,518 --> 00:13:42,974
that if you look a tiger
straight in the eye

30
00:13:43,852 --> 00:13:47,750
- She won't attack you.
- Is that possible, Sir Reginald?

31
00:13:49,285 --> 00:13:52,183
- What?
- I asked if it's easy to do

32
00:13:56,352 --> 00:14:00,580
No, quite the contrary.
It's the hardest thing on earth

33
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:04,315
especially if the tiger
looks at you

34
00:14:05,953 --> 00:14:07,283
straight in the eye

35
00:14:23,854 --> 00:14:27,650
Where are all these beautiful
people going?

36
00:14:29,087 --> 00:14:33,019
How is it that we see them all
together aboard this

37
00:14:34,187 --> 00:14:36,517
- Fabulous...
- Excuse me for cutting in,

38
00:14:36,654 --> 00:14:40,643
but here you're in
the waiters' way

39
00:14:40,821 --> 00:14:43,878
Could you please go into that
corner, for example?

40
00:14:44,022 --> 00:14:47,182
- I see.
- Thanks, that's kind of you

41
00:14:47,555 --> 00:14:49,384
I'm grateful. Excuse me

42
00:14:56,956 --> 00:15:02,184
As I was saying, where are all
these characters going?

43
00:15:02,522 --> 00:15:05,682
They represent, as it were,
the highest

44
00:15:06,356 --> 00:15:10,186
values in the fascinating world
of show business, of the arts

45
00:15:13,189 --> 00:15:14,655
Now I'll tell you who they are

46
00:15:15,556 --> 00:15:18,022
The talented superintendent
of La Scala in Milan

47
00:15:20,124 --> 00:15:22,487
his illustrious colleague
of the Rome opera

48
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,851
the one involved in the scandal
of cats, of rats

49
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:31,654
And that one is
his second wife,

50
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:35,015
the former singer Rumena.
The one with her back turned

51
00:15:35,758 --> 00:15:37,451
is his first wife's daughter

52
00:15:38,457 --> 00:15:44,448
His secretary, a medium with
amazing visions

53
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:50,015
and by the window, the legendary
conductor Von Rupert

54
00:15:51,225 --> 00:15:54,783
the child prodigy, slightly more
child than prodigy,

55
00:15:54,925 --> 00:15:57,823
holding on as always to his
terrible mother's skirts

56
00:15:58,092 --> 00:16:01,525
Out there is a seagull, it beats
its wings like a conductor

57
00:16:02,092 --> 00:16:05,650
- In the style of...
- My work as a chronicler is hard

58
00:16:05,792 --> 00:16:08,122
due to the amount and accuracy of
the information I must provide

59
00:16:09,893 --> 00:16:11,324
Now let's see... oh yes

60
00:16:11,826 --> 00:16:14,314
The famous tenor Aureliano
Fuciletto

61
00:16:14,993 --> 00:16:17,788
That would be the bearded one
feeding the seagull

62
00:16:18,526 --> 00:16:21,651
- Do you want it? I'll eat it!
- How witty

63
00:16:21,826 --> 00:16:24,792
The two superintendents of the
Vienna opera, born in Warsaw

64
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:27,526
Ah, a toast, thank you!

65
00:16:27,894 --> 00:16:30,155
The feared columnist,
Brenda Hilton

66
00:16:31,927 --> 00:16:32,915
How are you, Ziloev?

67
00:16:34,694 --> 00:16:36,785
He is the deepest bass
in the world

68
00:16:37,361 --> 00:16:41,123
The mezzo Valegnani and the
ever so nice Ines Ruffo Salitin

69
00:16:41,495 --> 00:16:45,052
The singing masters Rubetti.
And finally, she

70
00:16:45,228 --> 00:16:49,524
who after the death of Tetua
became a well-loved queen

71
00:16:49,661 --> 00:16:52,184
among today's voices:
Ildebranda Cuffari

72
00:16:55,395 --> 00:16:58,556
- What's your name, sir?
- David Fizmaier.

73
00:16:59,029 --> 00:17:02,052
- What do you do?
- I'm a conductor

74
00:17:02,195 --> 00:17:06,560
- Ah, an orchestra conductor?
- Precisely

75
00:17:06,729 --> 00:17:09,752
Thank you. And the lady?

76
00:17:11,996 --> 00:17:14,394
- She's a famous dancer!
- I see

77
00:17:15,196 --> 00:17:17,991
- And what's her name?
- What do you mean? Svetlana!

78
00:17:18,196 --> 00:17:19,786
- Everyone knows her!
- Thanks

79
00:17:22,963 --> 00:17:23,759
Oh, it came in!

80
00:17:25,797 --> 00:17:27,262
I didn't know it could fly
inside!

81
00:17:27,397 --> 00:17:29,057
It's obvious that it's
a domestic seagull!

82
00:17:29,563 --> 00:17:31,529
Go to the tool room,
have them bring a ladder!

83
00:17:31,897 --> 00:17:34,261
- Partexano! The net!
- What?

84
00:17:34,398 --> 00:17:35,920
The net, in my cabin!

85
00:17:36,464 --> 00:17:39,453
It never happened! Excuse me!
It was a stupid incident

86
00:17:39,598 --> 00:17:40,427
I'm really...

87
00:17:44,965 --> 00:17:49,363
- I'm scared.
- Don't be afraid, they'll catch it

88
00:17:49,498 --> 00:17:50,429
Without a doubt, they will!

89
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:56,164
Take it there and be on guard

90
00:17:57,399 --> 00:17:58,830
By the way,
who's going upstairs?

91
00:17:59,198 --> 00:18:02,130
- Be quick!
- Captain, let us try

92
00:18:02,298 --> 00:18:04,093
They will only frighten
it more.

93
00:18:05,165 --> 00:18:06,188
That's right, the net!

94
00:18:07,432 --> 00:18:09,898
Watch the chandeliers!

95
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:14,156
And the bird was free

96
00:18:15,999 --> 00:18:17,897
to look for its birdcage

97
00:18:19,033 --> 00:18:23,295
- Do I know you, sir?
- I wanted to interview you

98
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,160
- Then talk to my secretary.
- O.K., later then

99
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:33,323
- Come on, go out. Through here.
- Have they caught it?

100
00:18:39,367 --> 00:18:43,823
Go out. Fly away.
Bye, beautiful!

101
00:18:43,968 --> 00:18:47,025
Close the window! Tomorrow I'll
change my table

102
00:18:47,201 --> 00:18:49,564
Captain, the seagull has left,
sending regards

103
00:18:49,801 --> 00:18:53,131
- It didn't like the menu.
- He should change his table

104
00:18:54,035 --> 00:18:57,399
- The feather fell on your neck!
- Get it off!

105
00:18:57,901 --> 00:19:00,094
- Please, get it off!
- Don't get excited, my dear

106
00:19:00,235 --> 00:19:02,633
- But lldebranda, it brings luck.
- I don't see anything

107
00:19:02,835 --> 00:19:05,767
The bird wanted to pay its
respects to you. Here we are!

108
00:19:07,702 --> 00:19:08,998
I don't want to see it!

109
00:19:14,902 --> 00:19:16,993
- Maestro!
- One, two...

110
00:19:24,669 --> 00:19:26,931
A 5-meter-high equestrian
monument!

111
00:19:27,669 --> 00:19:31,227
It was his dream! And now that
he's got it

112
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:33,768
he cannot see it, poor Papa!

113
00:19:34,303 --> 00:19:36,428
Long live our prince!

114
00:19:41,104 --> 00:19:44,161
I'm a journalist, I must
interview the Grand Duke, please

115
00:19:45,338 --> 00:19:48,361
The noble person we've awaited is
the Grand Duke of Herzog

116
00:19:49,804 --> 00:19:50,929
How old is he?

117
00:19:52,138 --> 00:19:54,104
Judging by his political ability,
I think about eight

118
00:19:54,238 --> 00:19:57,295
He is followed by his sister Herimia,
the blind princess

119
00:19:57,471 --> 00:20:01,029
who lost her sight while still
a child. Have you noticed?

120
00:20:01,371 --> 00:20:05,168
She walks at the side of
the Premier so confidently!

121
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:08,604
She doesn't want compassion

122
00:20:10,372 --> 00:20:12,997
and she doesn't want help,
as if she could see!

123
00:20:13,606 --> 00:20:16,766
Consomme Vichyssoise, turtle
soup.

124
00:20:17,105 --> 00:20:20,868
Yesterday's excellent cream soup,
can we have it today too?

125
00:20:21,639 --> 00:20:25,662
That was vegetable soup

126
00:20:26,873 --> 00:20:30,203
Yes, it was vegetable soup

127
00:20:48,307 --> 00:20:50,966
Do you want to know why they're
making this trip?

128
00:20:51,674 --> 00:20:55,299
It's a funeral. You'll ask,
"What do you mean, a funeral?"

129
00:20:55,941 --> 00:20:58,338
Yes, ladies and gentlemen,
a funeral

130
00:20:58,574 --> 00:21:02,563
All these famous characters are
here to follow a funeral

131
00:21:03,542 --> 00:21:08,497
It was her expressed wish,
in her last will and testament

132
00:21:08,742 --> 00:21:13,504
"Cremation and dispersion of my
ashes when the sun rises

133
00:21:14,308 --> 00:21:17,275
"around the island where
I was born."

134
00:21:18,076 --> 00:21:23,031
That's the island of Erimo,
where Edmea Tetua was born

135
00:21:23,543 --> 00:21:25,702
and where her soul wishes
to return

136
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:29,839
Edmea Tetua, the greatest singer
of all time!

137
00:21:30,043 --> 00:21:33,010
A vocal miracle! The voice
of a goddess!

138
00:21:35,343 --> 00:21:36,434
Light blue

139
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:42,665
Light blue and white.
Ultramarine blue

140
00:21:46,244 --> 00:21:50,301
Light blue, ultramarine blue

141
00:21:51,511 --> 00:21:58,637
Emerald green. Green.
Light blue

142
00:21:59,178 --> 00:22:03,008
Music makes her see
a rainbow

143
00:22:04,445 --> 00:22:08,400
White, white, white

144
00:22:08,578 --> 00:22:11,976
My sister says that each note
has its own color

145
00:22:12,278 --> 00:22:17,177
The scientists of Sotierre say
some people have this power

146
00:22:17,312 --> 00:22:19,903
by which they have a chromatic
view of sounds

147
00:22:21,246 --> 00:22:23,235
Excuse me for interfering,

148
00:22:24,012 --> 00:22:27,376
but I don't think that anyone
can prove such a thing

149
00:22:28,179 --> 00:22:31,112
Anybody can say he sees colors

150
00:22:31,646 --> 00:22:34,737
Mr. Kuntz, it's obvious that not
everyone can have

151
00:22:35,646 --> 00:22:40,102
such a sensitive soul!

152
00:22:40,414 --> 00:22:42,141
I wouldn't dare to doubt it!

153
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:47,174
I'm just saying that it's almost
impossible to prove

154
00:22:48,114 --> 00:22:51,171
Once when I was ill,
all faces were green to me

155
00:22:52,447 --> 00:22:55,414
But we can all perceive
the colors of music

156
00:22:56,614 --> 00:22:59,445
And not only music. Voices are
colored too

157
00:22:59,581 --> 00:23:02,604
You say my voice is grey! But
is it always grey?

158
00:23:03,281 --> 00:23:06,645
Not always. When you are worried

159
00:23:07,948 --> 00:23:09,880
your voice becomes rusty

160
00:23:10,548 --> 00:23:15,277
Brownish red. But the police
chief's voice

161
00:23:15,681 --> 00:23:21,876
is always the same color.
Yellowish, matte, not clear!

162
00:23:22,015 --> 00:23:24,675
And what color is the voice of
our general?

163
00:23:26,315 --> 00:23:29,804
I'd like to hear it, General

164
00:23:30,183 --> 00:23:35,081
This is my voice. I'm unable
to sing with it

165
00:23:39,483 --> 00:23:41,108
Strange!

166
00:23:42,784 --> 00:23:46,341
I see no color.
A voice without color,

167
00:23:46,784 --> 00:23:49,875
like a void, an absence

168
00:23:50,317 --> 00:23:54,340
A void as head of the
Armed Forces is troubling!

169
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:03,940
Here, her ashes are all here

170
00:24:04,451 --> 00:24:06,542
For this small casket,

171
00:24:07,185 --> 00:24:10,447
so small, and yet so large,

172
00:24:10,718 --> 00:24:13,809
friends and fans from around
the whole world

173
00:24:14,685 --> 00:24:19,174
chartered the most luxurious liner,

174
00:24:20,252 --> 00:24:22,548
commanded by the fearless
captain

175
00:24:23,185 --> 00:24:25,811
born in indomitable Genoa

176
00:24:26,086 --> 00:24:29,518
Spezia! Spezia!

177
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:35,079
Spezia! Born in indomitable
Spezia,

178
00:24:36,219 --> 00:24:39,845
Captain Leonardo De Robertis

179
00:24:42,154 --> 00:24:44,847
It's the other way round,
Roberto De Leonardis

180
00:24:45,453 --> 00:24:48,249
- What did I say?
- Roberto De Leonardis!

181
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:53,215
Right. And he shall lead us
to the island of Erimo

182
00:24:54,087 --> 00:24:58,918
so that all of us can solemnly
perform

183
00:25:01,155 --> 00:25:02,950
the funeral rites,

184
00:25:04,155 --> 00:25:05,848
spreading the...

185
00:25:09,754 --> 00:25:10,720
Sir Reginald!

186
00:25:12,622 --> 00:25:13,485
Excuse me

187
00:25:14,789 --> 00:25:17,118
Sir Reginald! Sir Reginald!

188
00:25:17,855 --> 00:25:22,310
Excuse me, just a couple
of questions

189
00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:29,484
Is it true that you were the one
who asked our divine singer

190
00:25:30,289 --> 00:25:31,516
to make her debut in London?

191
00:25:32,856 --> 00:25:36,083
- Of course. Please excuse me.
- Thanks

192
00:26:02,857 --> 00:26:05,255
Look Rudi, he's looking
for her

193
00:26:07,425 --> 00:26:11,551
This is the second wheel, should
the one in the main deck fail

194
00:26:12,558 --> 00:26:17,184
This is the mechanism used to
maneuver, without the other one

195
00:26:17,558 --> 00:26:21,389
- And when do you use this one?
- For emergency cases, as I said

196
00:26:21,691 --> 00:26:25,055
- And what is down there?
- Please follow me

197
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:29,491
He's an Egyptian. They say he was
our great artist's lover

198
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:32,054
He owns all the railways
in his country

199
00:26:32,993 --> 00:26:35,754
It seems his penis is enormous,
violet colored

200
00:26:38,293 --> 00:26:40,781
That's something I heard,
of course

201
00:26:46,527 --> 00:26:49,618
Ah, here he is!
He hasn't found her

202
00:26:57,727 --> 00:27:02,853
There are strange rumors about
our baron and his gentle wife

203
00:27:03,693 --> 00:27:05,489
Did you see it too?
Really upset

204
00:27:06,894 --> 00:27:09,588
Upset and longing, what?

205
00:29:02,801 --> 00:29:06,198
That F wasn't right, didn't
you hear it was off-key?

206
00:29:06,333 --> 00:29:09,891
What do you mean, off-key? It was
perfect, didn't you hear?

207
00:29:10,168 --> 00:29:13,622
That way it doesn't fall. If you
remove a single drop of water

208
00:29:13,834 --> 00:29:18,233
- It becomes a different note!
- This way it doesn't fall

209
00:29:18,401 --> 00:29:21,390
but you, being tone deaf, go on
with your pa, pa pa

210
00:29:21,535 --> 00:29:24,831
You rise instead
of going down.

211
00:29:49,836 --> 00:29:51,927
How marvelous! It looks as if it
were painted!

212
00:29:53,236 --> 00:29:57,532
Oh, look, Lisa! Look! The moon!

213
00:29:57,804 --> 00:30:00,065
The sun, and the moon, together!

214
00:30:00,303 --> 00:30:03,736
The overture of Barber of Seville
gives me goose pimples!

215
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:08,600
And that's Andromeda, and that
small star on the right

216
00:30:09,104 --> 00:30:13,161
near Orion was discovered
only 50 years ago

217
00:30:13,337 --> 00:30:16,701
Correct, Sir Reginald. You're
giving a lesson in astronomy!

218
00:30:16,938 --> 00:30:18,597
That star is known
as Cauda Pavonis

219
00:30:19,604 --> 00:30:21,763
Its blue silver, see? But now
it's emerald

220
00:30:22,337 --> 00:30:24,099
and now bright orange

221
00:30:25,138 --> 00:30:29,070
And do you know who discovered
it? A well-known surgeon

222
00:30:29,238 --> 00:30:30,363
who was an amateur astronomer

223
00:30:31,238 --> 00:30:33,965
Guess what his name was?
Reginald!

224
00:30:36,439 --> 00:30:40,701
Besides the myth of a great
singer, she was a sensitive girl,

225
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:43,566
very Ionely. One felt one had
to help her,

226
00:30:43,705 --> 00:30:47,001
but maybe you're interested in
a few events in Edmea's life?

227
00:30:47,306 --> 00:30:49,499
The lady is her cousin, why
don't you ask her?

228
00:30:49,906 --> 00:30:51,065
Yes, I could have sung

229
00:30:53,907 --> 00:30:55,202
- Captain!
- Mr. Orlando

230
00:30:55,606 --> 00:30:58,504
- How are you, Reverend?
- What a view!

231
00:30:59,007 --> 00:31:01,768
- On one side the cold moon.
- Good evening

232
00:31:01,973 --> 00:31:05,133
- Divine!
- On the other the sun's heat

233
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:08,800
Absolutely beautiful. Between
light and darkness, and

234
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:11,929
fire and ice, there you are,
lldebranda

235
00:31:12,874 --> 00:31:15,669
- How poetic.
- Can I accompany you?

236
00:31:16,174 --> 00:31:19,800
- It's too humid here!
- Thirty years have gone by

237
00:31:19,974 --> 00:31:21,735
I haven't seen her since then

238
00:31:22,008 --> 00:31:25,031
I don't remember anything. Sorry,
we were children

239
00:31:25,808 --> 00:31:28,138
Thank you, madame. Anyhow,
you've told me something

240
00:31:30,108 --> 00:31:34,598
When there is a moon, he says that
nightwatch makes him nervous

241
00:31:34,742 --> 00:31:37,299
Hi! Who knows you, dear friend?

242
00:31:39,542 --> 00:31:41,304
But I have to write
about you

243
00:31:42,176 --> 00:31:45,267
and that one there, for example,
that fatso waving at me

244
00:31:45,675 --> 00:31:49,267
Who knows him? My job is a bit
ludicrous, isn't it?

245
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:31,608
- She never read the contracts.
- Is there a place for me?

246
00:32:31,745 --> 00:32:32,802
Nor signed them.

247
00:32:34,112 --> 00:32:39,908
Whatever was practical
offended her deeply

248
00:32:40,312 --> 00:32:43,710
But we're creatures of habit,
we are on it, all of us

249
00:32:43,978 --> 00:32:46,944
And yet she knew her
contractual rights

250
00:32:47,212 --> 00:32:49,405
better than any attorneys

251
00:32:49,546 --> 00:32:51,444
Before going into the theatre,
he once told me:

252
00:32:51,612 --> 00:32:53,840
"Couldn't you remove my name
from the billboard?"

253
00:32:53,979 --> 00:32:57,843
No, I think she was conscious of
her personal charm

254
00:32:58,513 --> 00:33:00,740
Whoever came near her was
conquered!

255
00:33:01,346 --> 00:33:06,040
It might seem that way. But she
was terribly insecure

256
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:09,076
She was terrified of strangers

257
00:33:09,647 --> 00:33:12,340
But you should stop
telling stories about this girl

258
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,708
At least as a sign of respect.
Excuse me, which girl?

259
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,176
She may have been intimidating,
but she didn't scare me!

260
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:22,042
- You say she was aggressive?
- She threw things at people

261
00:33:22,181 --> 00:33:24,306
- Didn't she throw things?
- Aureliano!

262
00:33:24,648 --> 00:33:26,944
Actually, I never had problems

263
00:33:27,081 --> 00:33:29,843
- I'd like a glass of red wine.
- Of course, sir

264
00:33:30,148 --> 00:33:31,704
- But Lambrusco, mind you!
- Lambrusco

265
00:33:32,614 --> 00:33:35,978
She was the perfect partner,
she liked me a lot

266
00:33:36,815 --> 00:33:41,339
and this made our collaboration
ideal

267
00:33:42,615 --> 00:33:46,547
She always said I was the best,
the best Italian tenor

268
00:33:47,649 --> 00:33:50,638
True! Tetua always said so:

269
00:33:50,916 --> 00:33:53,541
to sing with Sabatino Lepori is
glorious!

270
00:33:54,183 --> 00:33:57,047
At my house, she wept before a
small painting

271
00:33:57,183 --> 00:34:01,115
"It makes me cry, madame" she said
with her eyes full of tears

272
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:04,473
And you, haven't you anything
to tell?

273
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:11,208
The most extraordinary fact
of those we have heard

274
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:16,206
was that in the last act of
La Traviata she was feverish

275
00:34:16,484 --> 00:34:19,678
She fully identified with
Violetta's character

276
00:34:26,951 --> 00:34:29,849
Mommy, did you love Tetua?

277
00:36:10,923 --> 00:36:13,014
Not one of your best
evenings, was it?

278
00:36:14,356 --> 00:36:15,947
I caught him leaving the cabin

279
00:36:17,256 --> 00:36:21,212
I thought he had an air of
satisfaction. Was it worth it?

280
00:36:24,124 --> 00:36:25,521
Answer me, Violet

281
00:36:35,558 --> 00:36:40,320
I'll go to sleep right
away tonight. I'm so tired

282
00:36:42,558 --> 00:36:46,389
Well? I want to know everything,
every detail

283
00:36:47,092 --> 00:36:49,081
Did you spot him on the dock?

284
00:36:49,459 --> 00:36:55,551
- Be nice, Reginald I'm sleepy!
- Oh, did you go too far?

285
00:36:55,692 --> 00:36:58,886
He came to repair the light,
it did not work properly

286
00:37:00,293 --> 00:37:02,350
You can do better than that, Violet!

287
00:37:03,193 --> 00:37:05,625
You know I'm afraid of the dark!

288
00:37:11,293 --> 00:37:16,158
You whore! You're amazing. Say it
with your little voice

289
00:37:18,426 --> 00:37:22,519
"Yes, Reginald, I'm a great
whore!"

290
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:24,719
I won't stand for it!

291
00:37:26,194 --> 00:37:28,490
- I can't bear it!
- Yes!

292
00:37:30,928 --> 00:37:34,519
- Give me that stupid bear!
- No! Anything but him!

293
00:37:34,661 --> 00:37:35,558
- Crazy bitch!
- Give it to me!

294
00:37:41,328 --> 00:37:44,488
Why? Why do you treat me like
that?

295
00:37:46,662 --> 00:37:50,150
Yes, I've earned it. Do it,
do anything you like!

296
00:37:57,595 --> 00:37:58,754
You have needs...

297
00:38:00,396 --> 00:38:01,419
you're a queen,

298
00:38:05,429 --> 00:38:08,486
my child, my boss

299
00:38:10,496 --> 00:38:14,360
Please, Violet, do it

300
00:38:15,063 --> 00:38:20,325
always, do it like this, more

301
00:38:20,863 --> 00:38:22,489
more

302
00:38:24,564 --> 00:38:26,223
"A vocal phenomenon"

303
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:32,129
"A divine voice." "A hundred
singers in one"

304
00:38:34,997 --> 00:38:38,191
So many definitions,
so many words

305
00:38:39,598 --> 00:38:41,927
They've written so many stories
about you

306
00:38:42,531 --> 00:38:44,793
But no one said who you really
were

307
00:38:46,765 --> 00:38:50,959
Your favorite flower.
You'll never be without it

308
00:38:52,099 --> 00:38:54,621
No one ever discovered your
secret, my love

309
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:56,695
I'm the only one who knows
who you really are.

310
00:38:58,032 --> 00:39:00,430
You're a child who came from
the sea

311
00:39:00,699 --> 00:39:02,722
Remember the poem I wrote
for you?

312
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:06,060
"Born from the sea,
like a goddess"

313
00:40:40,204 --> 00:40:41,000
Who is it?

314
00:41:08,738 --> 00:41:09,669
Who is it?

315
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:16,069
Your Highness,
I'm a journalist

316
00:41:17,673 --> 00:41:20,468
- Excuse me!
- Good night

317
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:36,964
- Thank you.
- Oh, of course

318
00:41:51,541 --> 00:41:55,439
Count Bassano. A romantic guy

319
00:41:56,508 --> 00:41:57,769
Very romantic

320
00:42:01,142 --> 00:42:06,904
For years now, he always
brought her a very rare flower:

321
00:42:07,142 --> 00:42:10,734
"Rubens Pistila." You've seen it
in his cabin, haven't you?

322
00:42:11,843 --> 00:42:13,331
But I deny

323
00:42:13,843 --> 00:42:15,365
that he was ever in love
with her

324
00:42:18,143 --> 00:42:21,734
Perhaps he's in love with her,
since her death

325
00:42:22,742 --> 00:42:26,675
An ambiguous guy! Really
ambiguous!

326
00:42:30,376 --> 00:42:33,171
Under the pretense of setting up
a museum

327
00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:37,836
he managed to have them
keep him for years!

328
00:42:42,577 --> 00:42:43,475
Excuse me,

329
00:42:56,245 --> 00:42:59,574
These are notes

330
00:43:00,778 --> 00:43:01,903
that I have been jotting down

331
00:43:04,545 --> 00:43:09,307
for one of my newspapers: "I
write, I tell...

332
00:43:10,846 --> 00:43:12,903
"Well, what do I want to tell
about?

333
00:43:14,445 --> 00:43:15,570
"A sea voyage?

334
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:21,578
"A voyage through life, but it
is not told

335
00:43:21,812 --> 00:43:23,335
"It is made"

336
00:43:27,079 --> 00:43:30,170
Trivial, isn't it? Has this been
said already?

337
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:32,741
And better?

338
00:43:38,147 --> 00:43:40,977
But everything has already been
said and done!

339
00:43:51,881 --> 00:43:56,973
We're in the famous and smoky
boiler room

340
00:43:58,115 --> 00:43:59,637
What is it?

341
00:44:39,050 --> 00:44:42,813
This is the large boiler,
it never goes out

342
00:44:42,950 --> 00:44:44,610
How many hours do they work
in here?

343
00:44:48,484 --> 00:44:51,507
They are used to it

344
00:44:53,517 --> 00:44:56,382
Captain, sir, we all have a
small favor to ask

345
00:44:56,784 --> 00:45:00,376
- What did you say?
- Ask Madam Cuffari to sing!

346
00:45:00,651 --> 00:45:01,810
Scream louder!

347
00:45:01,951 --> 00:45:05,679
- We want to hear Cuffari sing!
- Are you crazy?

348
00:45:05,918 --> 00:45:08,281
This is a crazy request!

349
00:45:08,585 --> 00:45:12,984
- Friends, don't, on your life!
- Sing something, beautiful lady!

350
00:45:26,786 --> 00:45:29,809
Bravo, bravo!

351
00:46:04,354 --> 00:46:05,615
Bravo, bravo!

352
00:48:38,096 --> 00:48:40,755
The keeper is a Turk.
He loves the big beast

353
00:48:40,896 --> 00:48:42,725
- What did he say? Who
understood? -What a stink...

354
00:48:42,863 --> 00:48:46,728
He says since he came
aboard he has had nothing to eat!

355
00:48:47,730 --> 00:48:49,628
He needs to get some fresh air!

356
00:48:50,296 --> 00:48:54,195
- How can you heal it?
- Who will stroll it on deck?

357
00:48:54,430 --> 00:48:57,658
The other day you said the
beast was lovesick

358
00:48:57,997 --> 00:49:00,792
- What name have you given it?
- See how humiliated it is!

359
00:49:01,231 --> 00:49:02,924
Don't you ever wash, boy?

360
00:49:04,930 --> 00:49:11,295
- You're having a bad time, eh?
- We made it go down

361
00:49:12,564 --> 00:49:16,088
All animals on board suffer due
to the pitch and roll

362
00:49:16,298 --> 00:49:19,287
Even when they're not with
their cage mates

363
00:49:19,499 --> 00:49:21,362
- Pardon me.
- What?

364
00:49:21,532 --> 00:49:25,464
- You have to take her out.
- Just a moment! I'll take her!

365
00:49:26,065 --> 00:49:28,964
I was saying that this little
man was taken aboard in Genoa

366
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:30,496
We're taking him to Amsterdam

367
00:49:31,732 --> 00:49:34,664
These pachyderms are always
a handful on board

368
00:49:34,932 --> 00:49:38,228
Remember, Mr. Partexano, when
we took an elephant in?

369
00:49:38,366 --> 00:49:38,922
No

370
00:49:39,133 --> 00:49:41,497
- Do you?
- I wouldn't know.

371
00:49:41,633 --> 00:49:44,292
Yes! No! The "City of Brescia".

372
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:50,323
A small rodent had the bad idea
of visiting the elephant

373
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:53,231
The beast, terrified, broke
his chains

374
00:49:53,533 --> 00:49:55,931
and threw two sailors
into the sea

375
00:49:58,434 --> 00:50:00,024
Even here we have rats?

376
00:50:00,334 --> 00:50:03,459
Rats, dear madam,
are inevitable guests

377
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:05,223
They love sailing on the sea

378
00:50:05,534 --> 00:50:11,592
Yes? He's in love. And that's the
effect it has on it?

379
00:50:12,234 --> 00:50:15,689
- Love is debilitating.
- What are you saying?

380
00:50:15,834 --> 00:50:19,596
When I'm in love I feel stronger,
get fatter, become twice as big

381
00:50:19,734 --> 00:50:20,791
Love is healthy!

382
00:50:21,667 --> 00:50:23,224
Who's this girl?

383
00:50:27,668 --> 00:50:28,928
He's in love

384
00:50:36,002 --> 00:50:38,025
On the guard

385
00:50:40,902 --> 00:50:41,833
And now...

386
00:50:42,336 --> 00:50:44,359
Daydreaming during the watch!
You're nuts!

387
00:50:44,502 --> 00:50:46,196
Who is it? Help!

388
00:50:47,136 --> 00:50:48,624
Let me go, you're hurting me!

389
00:50:49,869 --> 00:50:52,700
I'll explain, I'm a journalist

390
00:50:53,436 --> 00:50:56,300
I've used this disguise to meet
the Grand Duke

391
00:50:57,436 --> 00:51:02,459
I must interview him.
Can't you help me?

392
00:51:08,870 --> 00:51:13,098
He says he's a journalist, wants
to interview the Grand Duke

393
00:51:14,970 --> 00:51:18,733
Listen! I'm a respectable
passenger aboard this ship

394
00:51:18,936 --> 00:51:23,266
A famous journalist, performing
his professional duties,

395
00:51:23,670 --> 00:51:27,000
informing his readers of world
events!

396
00:51:27,171 --> 00:51:30,399
I'll complain to the captain.
A journalist in here! Awful!

397
00:51:31,071 --> 00:51:35,163
He's a journalist, wishes to
interview the Grand Duke

398
00:51:40,838 --> 00:51:45,600
He's an Italian journalist who
succeeded in getting in

399
00:51:45,738 --> 00:51:46,704
He wants to ask you a few
questions

400
00:51:49,605 --> 00:51:50,298
Your Highness!

401
00:51:56,305 --> 00:52:02,897
- O.K., but with a translator.
- Let go of him!

402
00:52:03,972 --> 00:52:05,097
Let go of him!

403
00:52:08,739 --> 00:52:11,728
- I'm sorry.
- Never mind

404
00:52:16,006 --> 00:52:19,461
The Grand Duke grants you an
interview with a translator

405
00:52:19,672 --> 00:52:21,934
You'll ask your questions and
I'll translate them

406
00:52:22,573 --> 00:52:23,970
- Thank you!
- You may start!

407
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:30,834
An interview! He doesn't know
I'm less than anyone else

408
00:52:36,907 --> 00:52:41,067
We know you were a great fan of
this sublime artist,

409
00:52:42,274 --> 00:52:45,671
and the fact that you wanted to
pay your respects in this trip

410
00:52:45,807 --> 00:52:48,535
with your august presence has
touched everyone

411
00:52:49,107 --> 00:52:53,437
In the name of your extraordinary
humanity I would like to ask

412
00:52:54,241 --> 00:52:57,730
for a few words of comfort, of
hope for those who

413
00:52:57,875 --> 00:53:01,534
live without knowing what fate
has in store for us

414
00:53:01,875 --> 00:53:06,035
and feel threatened by the
international situation

415
00:53:06,975 --> 00:53:07,906
Thanks

416
00:53:10,675 --> 00:53:14,630
The Italian journalist says that
most men are unhappy

417
00:53:14,775 --> 00:53:18,207
and it seems he wants a word of
comfort

418
00:53:19,076 --> 00:53:21,701
What exactly is he asking for?

419
00:53:24,276 --> 00:53:25,832
He asked, "What's your question?"

420
00:53:26,509 --> 00:53:30,033
How does the Grand Duke see
the international situation

421
00:53:30,276 --> 00:53:31,139
Thank you.

422
00:53:33,109 --> 00:53:38,667
He wants your comments on
the international situation

423
00:53:41,576 --> 00:53:45,941
We're all sitting on the edge
of a mountain

424
00:53:48,144 --> 00:53:52,509
H.H. says, "We're all sitting on
the edge of a mountain"

425
00:53:55,210 --> 00:53:59,165
Excuse me for interfering,
but the Grand Duke

426
00:53:59,310 --> 00:54:02,743
said "the mouth..."
and then the rest.

427
00:54:02,978 --> 00:54:07,569
Count Kunz corrects me. He says
Y.H. said "mouth of a mountain"

428
00:54:07,711 --> 00:54:09,404
I though he said "edge"

429
00:54:14,544 --> 00:54:16,942
What mouth?

430
00:54:19,178 --> 00:54:21,644
He asks Your Highness "what
mouth?"

431
00:54:21,778 --> 00:54:26,176
Excuse me.
The Grand Duke used a metaphor

432
00:54:26,545 --> 00:54:31,375
He said we're all sitting
on the edge of a mountain

433
00:54:35,112 --> 00:54:38,203
Count Huppenback says the Grand
Duke used a metaphor

434
00:54:38,513 --> 00:54:41,035
and that the problem does not
lie in "edge" or "mouth"

435
00:54:41,745 --> 00:54:43,507
However, I understood "edge"

436
00:54:43,646 --> 00:54:47,305
- No, you see...
- No, no, edge

437
00:54:47,446 --> 00:54:48,241
- However, you know...
- Edge

438
00:54:48,379 --> 00:54:53,005
- He meant mouth!
- German is my 2nd language... edge!

439
00:54:57,446 --> 00:54:58,503
Oh, my God!

440
00:55:04,514 --> 00:55:09,742
- What does he want to say?
- I think H.H. wants to say...

441
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:12,870
Does he want to renege his duty?

442
00:55:14,447 --> 00:55:17,436
Do you wish to leave Italy to its
tragic fate?

443
00:55:18,413 --> 00:55:20,004
Your Highness, the journalist...

444
00:55:21,514 --> 00:55:25,970
Pum! Pum! Pum! Translate

445
00:55:29,681 --> 00:55:32,442
The Grand Duke says: "Pum! Pum!"

446
00:55:38,515 --> 00:55:40,504
The mouth of a mountain?

447
00:55:41,982 --> 00:55:45,312
That's the crater of a volcano!
We're sitting

448
00:55:45,615 --> 00:55:49,013
on the mouth of a volcano!
Perfect!

449
00:55:49,149 --> 00:55:52,206
Now I got it! It's a tragedy.
Thank you

450
00:55:52,482 --> 00:55:56,914
The mouth of a mountain!
Undoubtedly, a catastrophe

451
00:56:02,182 --> 00:56:04,444
The interview is over

452
00:56:04,582 --> 00:56:06,242
"The interview is over"

453
00:56:07,116 --> 00:56:09,604
Of course, I thank His Highness.
Gentlemen!

454
00:56:35,518 --> 00:56:36,506
Look at Mommy!

455
00:56:39,317 --> 00:56:40,214
Look!

456
00:56:52,784 --> 00:56:54,045
Maestro, let us rehearse!

457
00:57:07,619 --> 00:57:12,449
- Mr. Orlando.
- Thank you, my love

458
00:57:16,819 --> 00:57:20,479
It's the second day, and all
is well

459
00:57:22,886 --> 00:57:24,477
and in order to remember
this day,

460
00:57:26,553 --> 00:57:27,814
photographs are taken

461
00:57:29,019 --> 00:57:31,485
Two, no three! Four!
They're there, there

462
00:57:34,219 --> 00:57:36,981
Our tenor, Fuciletto, would like
to be a dolphin

463
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:40,584
and the two song masters,
whale hunters

464
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:44,685
This is the funny thing about
sea voyages

465
00:57:45,820 --> 00:57:50,014
After a few days, you feel as
if you'd been sailing forever

466
00:57:50,787 --> 00:57:54,116
You feel you've always known
your fellow voyagers

467
00:57:55,354 --> 00:57:56,149
Captain!

468
00:58:03,621 --> 00:58:04,518
Stay put, like that!

469
00:58:04,921 --> 00:58:08,046
Just one minute, please,
get ready

470
00:58:08,787 --> 00:58:11,015
My grandfather always wanted
to have his portrait painted

471
00:58:11,221 --> 00:58:14,244
He spent half his life sitting
for painters!

472
00:58:14,488 --> 00:58:16,818
They had to sit longer
than we do!

473
00:58:18,922 --> 00:58:19,888
Am I all right here?

474
00:58:59,624 --> 00:59:02,055
How much happier our people
would be

475
00:59:02,690 --> 00:59:05,281
if they were ruled by these
delicate hands

476
00:59:06,090 --> 00:59:07,818
We're all waiting for that day

477
00:59:25,124 --> 00:59:27,716
- Smile, Daddy!
- I am smiling!

478
00:59:34,825 --> 00:59:37,484
Have you noticed that whenever
he deals we lose?

479
00:59:38,725 --> 00:59:41,191
Mr. Orlando, we need
the press here!

480
00:59:41,459 --> 00:59:45,721
Come with us. Our Russian says
his voice is so deep

481
00:59:45,925 --> 00:59:47,619
that it causes catatonia

482
00:59:49,058 --> 00:59:50,786
Good morning to you all!

483
00:59:53,826 --> 00:59:54,792
A hen!

484
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:58,989
- Please.
- What?

485
00:59:59,459 --> 01:00:00,686
A live hen!

486
01:00:02,826 --> 01:00:05,190
- He wants a live hen!
- Yes, dear friends,

487
01:00:05,393 --> 01:00:08,621
we're sorry to interrupt your
gastronomic activities,

488
01:00:08,759 --> 01:00:10,850
but we really need a hen

489
01:00:11,326 --> 01:00:15,349
- We have to perform an experiment.
- I need to put it here

490
01:00:15,727 --> 01:00:17,091
Quite unusual but very
important

491
01:00:18,027 --> 01:00:22,255
You all will attend. We've
got the captain's permission

492
01:00:22,627 --> 01:00:25,423
I won't tell you what it's all
about because if it succeeds

493
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:28,584
it will be an extraordinary
surprise!

494
01:00:30,094 --> 01:00:31,424
Does the chef agree?
Thank you all

495
01:00:31,561 --> 01:00:33,823
- Thanks!
- You're welcome!

496
01:00:35,261 --> 01:00:38,625
Come, we must document
this event for posterity

497
01:00:43,162 --> 01:00:47,219
- What are you doing?
- Put it on top

498
01:00:48,694 --> 01:00:51,217
No, turn it like this,
turn its head this way

499
01:00:53,529 --> 01:00:55,620
Now please be silent

500
01:01:31,563 --> 01:01:32,688
Maybe it'll lay an egg!

501
01:02:16,565 --> 01:02:20,759
Look, it's sleeping now!

502
01:02:24,266 --> 01:02:29,597
- Right, it closed its eyes!
- Incredible, poor chicken!

503
01:02:31,833 --> 01:02:32,924
What's happened
to him?

504
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:38,923
- My God, he's sick! A doctor!
- Take him away from the fire!

505
01:02:39,066 --> 01:02:40,759
- Hold his feet above his head!
- There, near the air!

506
01:02:42,466 --> 01:02:43,398
A bit of water!

507
01:02:48,267 --> 01:02:51,994
I noticed he was pale,
take him outside!

508
01:02:52,133 --> 01:02:53,463
Take a glass of water and pour
it on his face

509
01:02:53,734 --> 01:02:55,359
Breathe deeply, sir

510
01:02:55,634 --> 01:02:57,190
You have to be acclimated
to be down here

511
01:03:00,634 --> 01:03:02,327
He's better. It's over,
everything's over

512
01:03:03,067 --> 01:03:07,056
The hen's sleeping! Look,
it sleeps! He succeeded!

513
01:03:07,567 --> 01:03:10,295
True, it sleeps

514
01:03:10,568 --> 01:03:11,828
He made it sleep!

515
01:03:12,134 --> 01:03:13,464
you sleep too

516
01:03:14,568 --> 01:03:17,830
I doubt that you're satisfied

517
01:03:17,967 --> 01:03:20,126
with the rehearsal for
the Oratorio in Memoria

518
01:03:20,768 --> 01:03:25,133
Singing in remembrance of Edmea
requires your talent & technique,

519
01:03:25,401 --> 01:03:27,333
but also your gratitude

520
01:03:27,501 --> 01:03:29,626
to the great artist whom we
all loved

521
01:03:29,902 --> 01:03:31,891
Undoubtedly she was the
greatest Soprano of all time.

522
01:03:32,902 --> 01:03:34,232
Are you ready, lldebranda?

523
01:03:47,769 --> 01:03:49,564
What is that funny smell?

524
01:04:03,803 --> 01:04:06,633
- How old am I?
- What?

525
01:04:08,670 --> 01:04:11,136
- I didn't understand
- Well, how old?

526
01:04:13,737 --> 01:04:16,897
I couldn't say, I can't even
guess your age

527
01:04:20,337 --> 01:04:23,167
Don't be afraid, try!

528
01:04:25,404 --> 01:04:27,267
Come on, tell me at least how
old I look

529
01:04:29,437 --> 01:04:31,232
I don't know

530
01:04:35,638 --> 01:04:36,661
The same as my father

531
01:04:41,938 --> 01:04:43,767
And how old is your father?

532
01:04:45,038 --> 01:04:47,163
To me, my father is forever
young

533
01:04:51,338 --> 01:04:53,270
Excuse me, Mother

534
01:04:53,805 --> 01:04:57,464
Go get your cape, darling,
you can't stay like that

535
01:04:57,605 --> 01:05:01,003
- I'm not cold
- It gets damp when the sun sets

536
01:05:01,173 --> 01:05:03,798
Look at these colors, darling

537
01:05:04,006 --> 01:05:07,097
Every sunset bearing the stamp
of divinity!

538
01:05:07,672 --> 01:05:11,503
You know, Mr. Orlando, I spent
all Saturday painting

539
01:05:12,339 --> 01:05:15,203
I don't know what I'd give
to paint such a picture

540
01:05:15,406 --> 01:05:18,338
But how can we compete with
the Creator?

541
01:05:19,406 --> 01:05:21,202
Now I'd like to rehearse
the Domine Deus

542
01:05:21,439 --> 01:05:25,338
They're rehearsing.
Excuse me a moment

543
01:05:26,940 --> 01:05:28,701
Sit next to Fuciletto.

544
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:36,428
It's the Oratorio!

545
01:05:47,941 --> 01:05:51,566
Captain, I want to ask you
one thing. Last night

546
01:05:51,707 --> 01:05:55,003
I was awakened by a
patter on my porthole

547
01:05:55,308 --> 01:05:59,604
- Is that possible?
- It's our seagull, Icarus

548
01:06:00,208 --> 01:06:03,265
We gave him that name because
he broke a wing

549
01:06:03,608 --> 01:06:07,404
Don't you smell that horrible
odor? Why does it stink?

550
01:06:07,942 --> 01:06:08,999
Don't you smell it?

551
01:06:11,642 --> 01:06:16,631
- Mother, where is it coming from?
- Yes, it's the fish

552
01:06:16,775 --> 01:06:17,672
I can't breathe!

553
01:06:22,609 --> 01:06:25,268
- What's this stench?
- Are you looking at me?

554
01:06:25,509 --> 01:06:27,805
I'm not looking at you,
there's quite a stench!

555
01:06:28,276 --> 01:06:29,503
You talk of a stench
and look at me!

556
01:06:30,976 --> 01:06:31,999
I don't stink!

557
01:06:33,843 --> 01:06:35,275
- Idiot!
- You're the idiot!

558
01:06:35,410 --> 01:06:38,399
I'll tear off your moustache
and make you eat it!

559
01:06:38,676 --> 01:06:42,802
What are you doing? This smell
is in the air, outside

560
01:06:43,343 --> 01:06:46,832
Yes, gentlemen, the air is quite fetid

561
01:06:47,043 --> 01:06:49,976
but Dr. Lamela guarantees that
you cannot get infected

562
01:06:50,110 --> 01:06:54,304
- Absolutely! Stay calm!
- The discharge is lessening

563
01:06:54,477 --> 01:06:56,500
and before night it shall
cease completely

564
01:06:56,744 --> 01:06:58,903
Following our physician's
suggestion,

565
01:06:59,044 --> 01:07:01,805
we're trying to get the
pachyderm out of the hold

566
01:07:02,077 --> 01:07:05,601
- We'll hoist him on deck.
- It's being done, captain

567
01:07:06,344 --> 01:07:09,640
Some ship-boys will sling
the rhino on the scales

568
01:07:09,977 --> 01:07:11,876
and a winch will hoist him
on deck

569
01:07:12,211 --> 01:07:16,405
We can assure you everything'll
end very shortly

570
01:07:31,612 --> 01:07:32,737
Prepare the pumps!

571
01:07:34,412 --> 01:07:36,674
Keep the ropes taut!

572
01:07:42,512 --> 01:07:43,910
Increase pressure!

573
01:07:50,679 --> 01:07:53,475
- You'll throw him into the sea?
- No, on that lifeboat!

574
01:07:53,647 --> 01:07:55,237
The doctor said he needs
fresh air!

575
01:08:07,547 --> 01:08:08,706
Here!

576
01:08:11,381 --> 01:08:12,540
The stink!

577
01:08:12,680 --> 01:08:13,976
He's getting better, however

578
01:08:17,814 --> 01:08:20,905
- Like a flying dragon!
- You could use a bath!

579
01:08:49,382 --> 01:08:51,814
Everyone is looking at you,
get up!

580
01:09:13,483 --> 01:09:17,415
And she went from natural F
down to

581
01:09:17,550 --> 01:09:21,676
E flat to natural E

582
01:09:21,917 --> 01:09:26,111
to upper F. A miracle

583
01:09:26,617 --> 01:09:29,105
The orchestra was almost
silent,

584
01:09:29,450 --> 01:09:35,747
the audience stopped breathing,
and I was paralyzed hearing her

585
01:09:36,417 --> 01:09:38,747
I'll remember it all my life!

586
01:09:40,051 --> 01:09:41,812
Excuse me, Maestro, but how
could she?

587
01:09:42,584 --> 01:09:45,574
Almost three octaves without
making an effort...

588
01:09:46,218 --> 01:09:49,843
- That's not human!
- Why not, Edmea was just a woman

589
01:09:50,018 --> 01:09:53,178
So many racked their brains
trying to understand her!

590
01:09:54,718 --> 01:09:56,411
She must have had a secret

591
01:09:57,185 --> 01:10:01,413
and that's what I wanted to ask
you, Maestro

592
01:10:01,919 --> 01:10:03,680
...as I would ask a father... what...

593
01:10:03,818 --> 01:10:07,773
- What can I do?
- Listen

594
01:10:07,985 --> 01:10:11,349
One evening, Edmea told me
something, she said

595
01:10:11,619 --> 01:10:16,108
that when she sang,
she saw a snail

596
01:10:16,719 --> 01:10:20,015
- A snail?
- Yes, she said so

597
01:10:20,319 --> 01:10:22,683
"I see a snail

598
01:10:22,886 --> 01:10:28,682
"and with my eyes I follow the
spiral, curling up

599
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:31,977
"and my voice comes out without
making an effort."

600
01:10:32,187 --> 01:10:36,347
Do you understand? My dear,
it wasn't only lungs,

601
01:10:36,487 --> 01:10:38,385
diaphragm and vocal chords

602
01:10:38,654 --> 01:10:42,245
It was an energy-catalyzing
phenomenon

603
01:10:43,420 --> 01:10:47,251
I only know that Edmea was
different from anyone else

604
01:10:47,453 --> 01:10:52,011
She was unique. There'll never
be another like her!

605
01:11:10,388 --> 01:11:12,082
Why are you so quiet?

606
01:11:16,755 --> 01:11:19,244
You look like a marvelous
Egyptian sphinx

607
01:11:24,156 --> 01:11:25,315
You're superb!

608
01:11:30,489 --> 01:11:35,421
The third night of our voyage,
things started going wrong

609
01:11:36,056 --> 01:11:38,715
Everything became
more and more strange

610
01:11:52,123 --> 01:11:53,680
You interrupted me

611
01:11:54,457 --> 01:11:56,253
It's her fault,
she didn't want to come

612
01:11:56,690 --> 01:11:58,986
Be quiet. He's already
in a trance

613
01:12:05,824 --> 01:12:08,313
- Is he all right?
- Sit here, close by

614
01:12:08,891 --> 01:12:12,449
Hold hands, everyone. Maestro,
give your hand to madame

615
01:12:13,625 --> 01:12:16,250
- Me too?
- Yes. Sit with us

616
01:12:16,591 --> 01:12:19,217
Thanks, I'd rather stay out

617
01:12:19,458 --> 01:12:21,822
If Sister Angela knows I'm here

618
01:12:22,025 --> 01:12:24,513
she'll feed me only bread
and water for a week!

619
01:12:29,925 --> 01:12:31,914
Come on! Ask something!

620
01:12:37,058 --> 01:12:42,355
Edmea, excuse me, but I always
wanted to ask you

621
01:12:42,993 --> 01:12:45,788
Which opera made you
suffer most?

622
01:12:48,526 --> 01:12:50,856
What a stupid question!

623
01:12:52,193 --> 01:12:54,284
No, once you told me that

624
01:12:54,426 --> 01:12:56,790
- What fell?
- I don't know

625
01:12:56,926 --> 01:12:58,983
Don't break the chain!
It's dangerous

626
01:13:00,894 --> 01:13:03,087
- For God's sake!
- A book has opened!

627
01:13:03,493 --> 01:13:04,390
The icy hand

628
01:13:10,327 --> 01:13:13,054
Look! It's La Gioconda!

629
01:13:17,161 --> 01:13:18,627
It opened in La Gioconda!

630
01:13:19,894 --> 01:13:22,258
Look! It's La Gioconda!

631
01:13:23,261 --> 01:13:25,659
- Right! Incredible coincidence!
- How come?

632
01:13:25,794 --> 01:13:30,227
I can't stay. This is awful.
I can't stay. Excuse me!

633
01:13:34,794 --> 01:13:36,158
Could I also ask a question?

634
01:13:40,095 --> 01:13:42,890
He says no because he's afraid.
He understood that

635
01:13:43,195 --> 01:13:46,184
since I knew her well, I'd ask
a more intimate question

636
01:13:55,795 --> 01:13:59,193
Look, she always used
that gesture to thank

637
01:14:10,196 --> 01:14:13,685
Oh, Edmea, Edmea!

638
01:14:16,329 --> 01:14:19,853
Who is it? Who are you? Switch
the light on! You idiots!

639
01:14:20,030 --> 01:14:23,087
Who was it? Tell me who it was.
Who was it?

640
01:14:23,663 --> 01:14:27,993
- Who was it?
- Someone played a joke!

641
01:14:29,831 --> 01:14:32,160
What's the matter with you?
Come to, you idiot!

642
01:14:33,030 --> 01:14:34,656
Ines, come on, get your
bearings back!

643
01:14:34,797 --> 01:14:40,162
Is it you? Look at him, come
here, show yourself you clown

644
01:14:40,731 --> 01:14:43,163
Look who our ghost was!

645
01:14:43,531 --> 01:14:45,430
Leave her alone!

646
01:14:46,931 --> 01:14:49,954
We must applaud him, bravo!

647
01:14:50,365 --> 01:14:52,194
For a moment, there,
even I believed it!

648
01:14:54,231 --> 01:14:57,129
You had us all fooled

649
01:14:59,265 --> 01:15:04,062
- Damn you!
- Even you are inspired

650
01:15:04,199 --> 01:15:07,131
Excuse me, I thought you still
had the shivers

651
01:15:08,232 --> 01:15:12,164
And Ines, where's Ines?
Is she still unconscious?

652
01:15:14,399 --> 01:15:17,456
If you talk, you can't breathe

653
01:15:17,599 --> 01:15:20,156
to the beat of your feet

654
01:15:21,432 --> 01:15:26,330
- Where did she come from?
- I've never seen her!

655
01:15:26,866 --> 01:15:28,627
What are you doing here so late?

656
01:15:31,066 --> 01:15:32,157
Who are you?

657
01:15:33,567 --> 01:15:35,930
- She's a darling!
- Yes

658
01:15:36,066 --> 01:15:41,260
You're very pretty,
look at your pretty braids

659
01:15:42,033 --> 01:15:45,591
- You're a real darling.
- Wolfgang, let her be

660
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:47,964
What's your name?

661
01:16:15,402 --> 01:16:17,197
- Do you want to cause a disaster?
- Exactly

662
01:16:18,635 --> 01:16:19,431
I don't understand you

663
01:16:20,369 --> 01:16:22,301
You can't light fires on deck

664
01:16:23,968 --> 01:16:25,400
It's the grandmother,
how are you?

665
01:16:28,903 --> 01:16:29,834
Scram!

666
01:16:33,602 --> 01:16:34,568
Harder!

667
01:16:38,036 --> 01:16:39,002
Come on!

668
01:16:49,603 --> 01:16:50,534
Good day!

669
01:16:56,737 --> 01:16:57,703
Where were you?

670
01:16:59,703 --> 01:17:04,363
- Krassavitza!
- Ilia, who are these people?

671
01:17:04,637 --> 01:17:06,228
- I don't know them!
- Ildebranda!

672
01:17:08,404 --> 01:17:11,097
- They're Serbians!
- Come up!

673
01:17:11,237 --> 01:17:13,430
Serbians! Let's go listen!

674
01:17:14,271 --> 01:17:17,931
We're getting things ready
in the hold

675
01:17:18,504 --> 01:17:20,732
so as not to interfere with
activities on board

676
01:17:21,005 --> 01:17:22,834
or the privacy
of the passengers!

677
01:17:22,971 --> 01:17:28,665
But captain, how did it happen?
How did they come on board?

678
01:17:28,804 --> 01:17:32,464
When the Austrian Archduke was
murdered in Sarajevo,

679
01:17:32,605 --> 01:17:34,900
Austria declared war
against Serbia

680
01:17:35,539 --> 01:17:40,938
and the people fearing the
arrival of the enraged troops

681
01:17:41,238 --> 01:17:46,035
tried to escape by sea, and get
on a ship sailing Italy's coast

682
01:17:47,839 --> 01:17:51,635
- I don't understand.
- Call a doctor!

683
01:17:52,173 --> 01:17:54,469
They're Serbs, how did they get
on board?

684
01:17:54,706 --> 01:17:56,569
We rescued them
from the sea tonight

685
01:17:56,906 --> 01:17:59,997
We believe they are Serbs

686
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:06,806
Do you want water?

687
01:18:12,606 --> 01:18:16,232
Good morning, young lady.
Still sleepy?

688
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:18,905
Our physician is checking them,
one by one

689
01:18:20,107 --> 01:18:23,801
And my officers and myself,
by means of an interpreter,

690
01:18:23,941 --> 01:18:26,066
have talked to most of the men

691
01:18:26,541 --> 01:18:29,701
They are shepherds, peasants,
gypsies

692
01:18:30,208 --> 01:18:32,400
We rescued them at sea tonight

693
01:18:33,041 --> 01:18:34,438
There are also students,

694
01:18:34,774 --> 01:18:37,138
maybe unjustly chased
by the police

695
01:18:42,908 --> 01:18:47,568
Captain, no one can force us to
travel with these people

696
01:18:47,742 --> 01:18:49,038
who come God knows from where

697
01:18:52,975 --> 01:18:53,736
He's right

698
01:18:53,942 --> 01:18:56,135
Their rafts were sinking due
to the great weight

699
01:18:56,276 --> 01:19:00,867
To rescue these women, children,
these families in despair,

700
01:19:01,342 --> 01:19:04,001
was a duty I could not forego

701
01:19:12,843 --> 01:19:15,002
Yesterday's Pommard was not one
of the best

702
01:19:15,676 --> 01:19:18,904
I'd like to suggest a white wine
for my wife and friends

703
01:19:19,043 --> 01:19:20,668
A Chablis, let's say.
Let's give it a try

704
01:19:21,177 --> 01:19:23,439
But I'll still have a Rayon
de Soleil champagne

705
01:19:29,343 --> 01:19:30,639
You! Scram, scram!

706
01:19:33,177 --> 01:19:36,940
- Look there!
- You're not worthy of the spaghetti

707
01:19:38,410 --> 01:19:39,433
Sit down, Monica

708
01:19:51,077 --> 01:19:52,304
Turn around and look.

709
01:19:56,478 --> 01:19:58,944
What does that pretty
one want?

710
01:20:00,344 --> 01:20:04,936
She's beautiful! Krassivaya.
She has savage eyes!

711
01:20:08,479 --> 01:20:11,468
I'm frankly embarrassed, eating
while they look at us like that!

712
01:20:11,612 --> 01:20:14,442
Divine providence will
look after them!

713
01:20:16,112 --> 01:20:20,704
- Right! If you're thinking...
- Finally they've decided...

714
01:20:22,779 --> 01:20:24,143
Why?

715
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:29,802
I'll drink to you! No!

716
01:20:30,712 --> 01:20:34,940
What're you doing?
I want to see my fiancee

717
01:20:38,046 --> 01:20:40,342
Violet, please

718
01:20:43,313 --> 01:20:46,404
Andrew, what do you think
she'll do?

719
01:20:46,947 --> 01:20:52,504
I think she wants to bring food
to the horrible people on deck!

720
01:20:54,281 --> 01:20:58,077
Violet, this philanthropic
gesture of yours

721
01:20:58,214 --> 01:20:59,612
is admirable, but
a bit too much

722
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:02,937
Sir, I'll try, Sir

723
01:21:03,347 --> 01:21:06,313
Please, Andrew, make her come
back to the table!

724
01:21:08,048 --> 01:21:12,742
- Sir Reginald wishes...
- I don't need any help

725
01:21:13,081 --> 01:21:14,876
Waiters, please follow me with
the trolley

726
01:21:15,048 --> 01:21:17,775
Mrs. Dongby, wait Mrs. Dongby.
A table is being set outside

727
01:21:17,915 --> 01:21:20,313
Good, so they'll have something
more today. Come on

728
01:21:20,448 --> 01:21:23,312
- I insist!
- Please open the door!

729
01:21:24,515 --> 01:21:27,504
- Excuse me.
- Thank you

730
01:21:28,048 --> 01:21:32,072
- My lady, please
- Can I bring them my soup, Mommy?

731
01:21:33,282 --> 01:21:38,408
- Do you think I should do it too?
- No, lldebranda, not at all

732
01:21:38,615 --> 01:21:41,104
- Mommy, please, let me take it!
- Not another word!

733
01:21:44,149 --> 01:21:46,138
Give me the tray, madame,
I'll carry it

734
01:21:46,583 --> 01:21:50,413
Now I've got to go with you.
Please

735
01:21:52,283 --> 01:21:56,215
Stay back. Sailor, tell them
to stay back.

736
01:21:56,349 --> 01:21:58,941
Let's come here, let's see if
you're a singer too

737
01:21:59,383 --> 01:22:02,111
Say "Aaah". Come on, open
your mouth!

738
01:22:02,384 --> 01:22:04,542
Stay back! Stay back!

739
01:22:06,083 --> 01:22:07,912
- Excuse me?
- I'll do it!

740
01:22:09,783 --> 01:22:12,807
Go back to the salon, madame!
I'll take over here

741
01:22:13,284 --> 01:22:14,648
How much do you want?

742
01:22:24,151 --> 01:22:27,311
Cut the cake and distribute it
to the children, to all of them!

743
01:22:28,451 --> 01:22:29,178
Yes

744
01:22:35,285 --> 01:22:36,148
Why are you laughing?

745
01:22:38,485 --> 01:22:39,348
What is it?

746
01:22:40,618 --> 01:22:41,242
What?

747
01:22:43,451 --> 01:22:46,508
What did you see?
Why're you laughing?

748
01:22:54,486 --> 01:23:00,112
It's inadmissible for a ship to
be boarded by Serb anarchists

749
01:23:00,252 --> 01:23:02,878
without the captain doing
anything to prevent it!

750
01:23:03,186 --> 01:23:07,243
Please. The captain must rescue
shipwrecks

751
01:23:07,452 --> 01:23:09,680
following a basic principle
in the Naval Code:

752
01:23:10,586 --> 01:23:14,383
- The duty of assistance.
- You probably know, Captain

753
01:23:14,686 --> 01:23:17,948
that among those you kindly
define as refugees

754
01:23:18,120 --> 01:23:20,779
there are professional
assassins

755
01:23:20,920 --> 01:23:21,784
That's right!

756
01:23:22,020 --> 01:23:26,180
This is very serious. The Grand
Duke's life is in jeopardy

757
01:23:26,720 --> 01:23:29,242
We'll protest before
the Italian government!

758
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:31,452
We'll protest before your
government!

759
01:23:31,954 --> 01:23:34,318
I'll be responsible for
His Highness' safety

760
01:23:34,620 --> 01:23:36,779
aboard this ship around the clock

761
01:23:37,921 --> 01:23:42,183
As soon as they came on board,
I've ordered my officers

762
01:23:42,555 --> 01:23:44,214
to control them,

763
01:23:45,021 --> 01:23:47,783
to isolate any potentially
dangerous persons

764
01:23:49,188 --> 01:23:51,780
Control is not enough

765
01:23:51,988 --> 01:23:55,920
if those so-called refugees
can move freely

766
01:23:56,055 --> 01:23:58,351
throughout the ship, on deck,

767
01:23:58,688 --> 01:24:02,177
in the bar, in the halls,
in the salon

768
01:24:04,755 --> 01:24:07,880
Cuoco! You speak their language,
they cannot stay here

769
01:24:08,022 --> 01:24:10,488
They have to go!
Captain's orders

770
01:24:15,489 --> 01:24:17,216
Leave, all of you, scram

771
01:24:23,256 --> 01:24:27,154
Hello! I'd like a box
of cookies. Good ones.

772
01:24:27,689 --> 01:24:29,053
Right! These are chocolate

773
01:24:30,690 --> 01:24:32,315
- Are they good?
- Yes, thank you

774
01:24:36,156 --> 01:24:39,680
How much? How much?
Here you are!

775
01:24:48,723 --> 01:24:50,882
Don't make us evict you
by force!

776
01:24:51,157 --> 01:24:56,953
You must go back on deck, come
on! Sailors, take them on deck

777
01:24:57,524 --> 01:25:00,422
Whoever knows the language, tell
them we're getting them a place

778
01:25:00,691 --> 01:25:03,851
You may not cross these ropes

779
01:25:03,991 --> 01:25:08,253
without asking permission from
the sailor on duty. Translate!

780
01:25:09,192 --> 01:25:12,590
Stay behind the ropes,
do you understand?

781
01:25:16,125 --> 01:25:18,591
Did they understand? They
may not leave this place

782
01:25:18,725 --> 01:25:21,156
Olga, little one, come here,
come here, beautiful!

783
01:25:22,325 --> 01:25:25,416
Do you like cookies?
Take them, darling.

784
01:25:26,292 --> 01:25:27,485
They are all yours.

785
01:25:28,458 --> 01:25:30,322
Taste them, put them
in your mouth

786
01:25:30,659 --> 01:25:32,750
What a lovely dress
you're wearing!

787
01:25:33,625 --> 01:25:37,217
Is this your daughter?
She's lovely, Klassivaia!

788
01:25:37,759 --> 01:25:41,453
I was giving her cookies.
Take them, little Olga

789
01:26:40,962 --> 01:26:44,190
This is further proof that one
cannot trust the Italians

790
01:26:45,162 --> 01:26:49,390
Your Highness, I was right
predicting trouble in this voyage

791
01:26:53,062 --> 01:26:57,620
- Aren't you going to make a move?
- Let me think, if I make a move...

792
01:27:05,030 --> 01:27:05,961
Your Highness

793
01:27:13,230 --> 01:27:17,026
Excuse me, for safety reasons
I must ask Your Highness

794
01:27:17,163 --> 01:27:19,959
not to leave this cabin till
this situation on deck

795
01:27:20,096 --> 01:27:21,085
is under control

796
01:27:26,264 --> 01:27:29,696
Isn't that a bit too much?
But thank you anyhow

797
01:27:31,565 --> 01:27:32,825
Excuse me

798
01:27:45,098 --> 01:27:50,190
I don't feel in danger.
Ah, right

799
01:27:54,165 --> 01:27:55,960
Checkmate!

800
01:27:56,765 --> 01:27:59,698
I can't play with you!
You always win

801
01:28:02,032 --> 01:28:04,760
You move the pieces saying you
want to "look" at them

802
01:28:11,699 --> 01:28:12,722
What is it?

803
01:28:13,465 --> 01:28:16,296
- I'm afraid!
- What of?

804
01:28:17,832 --> 01:28:22,697
- I don't know, it's too complex.
- It is not

805
01:28:29,366 --> 01:28:31,161
Listen, do you remember?

806
01:29:01,634 --> 01:29:05,226
In the 5th century the Serbs
descended on the Balkans

807
01:29:05,868 --> 01:29:07,925
and then invaded Epirus
and Thessaly

808
01:29:09,135 --> 01:29:11,363
Can you imagine if they're
confined to the stern area?

809
01:29:22,969 --> 01:29:26,231
I see the thermometer, I've got
a fever of 103! What shall I do?

810
01:29:26,369 --> 01:29:29,062
Spoil the show? The audience
had come to see me

811
01:29:29,203 --> 01:29:33,659
- Change the topic.
- No, I sang and gave 7 encores!

812
01:29:33,803 --> 01:29:38,132
You build a mystic gulf where
there are hardly 50 players...

813
01:29:38,269 --> 01:29:41,929
The strength of character and
the grace of warm feminity

814
01:29:42,103 --> 01:29:43,432
make English women...

815
01:29:43,903 --> 01:29:48,427
Let's not waste time beating around
the bush, O.K.?

816
01:30:05,404 --> 01:30:08,495
She's so expressive, she almost
seems to understand what's said

817
01:30:51,940 --> 01:30:56,032
My brother is asleep,
fast asleep

818
01:30:57,873 --> 01:31:00,203
Your Highness, can't we change
our decision?

819
01:31:00,507 --> 01:31:02,029
The voyage is getting to its
end

820
01:31:02,806 --> 01:31:05,170
and Count von Stauffen is
getting more & more suspicious

821
01:31:06,906 --> 01:31:12,237
No, everything'll turn out all right
without us doing a thing

822
01:31:13,240 --> 01:31:15,638
How can you be sure,
Your Highness?

823
01:31:16,208 --> 01:31:19,537
I've had this dream: I was
in a garden with my brother

824
01:31:20,208 --> 01:31:22,935
and an eagle swept down
from Heaven

825
01:31:23,141 --> 01:31:27,733
It flies towards us, catches
my brother and flies away

826
01:31:28,474 --> 01:31:31,736
But he, poor thing, is heavy,
so heavy

827
01:31:32,975 --> 01:31:35,668
So the eagle lets him fall

828
01:31:35,808 --> 01:31:40,264
and he is swallowed up
by a hole in the ground

829
01:31:40,942 --> 01:31:42,840
You can always set my mind
at ease

830
01:31:43,375 --> 01:31:45,341
make me believe every word
you say

831
01:32:04,109 --> 01:32:07,303
Bravo! Hasn't she lovely color
in her voice?

832
01:32:07,809 --> 01:32:09,002
Who was singing?

833
01:32:26,677 --> 01:32:28,802
Like acrobats and monkeys!

834
01:32:56,512 --> 01:33:00,944
- Even the old people dance!
- They don't know anything

835
01:33:01,111 --> 01:33:04,771
This is a very ancient dance,
a pagan one! I've studied it!

836
01:33:04,912 --> 01:33:09,072
They dance it mixed up
with Hungarian Czardas

837
01:33:09,212 --> 01:33:12,542
This is a ritual dance, a rite,
and it goes like this

838
01:33:14,313 --> 01:33:15,210
Bravo!

839
01:33:17,712 --> 01:33:19,542
You're good!

840
01:33:22,745 --> 01:33:25,405
Go down, I want to see
you dance!

841
01:33:30,713 --> 01:33:34,668
Attention! I'd like to present
two great dance masters!

842
01:33:34,880 --> 01:33:37,402
They'll show you how you ought
to dance

843
01:33:38,147 --> 01:33:42,943
This dance is meant to bring
rain on the country

844
01:33:45,647 --> 01:33:50,579
The women lift their arms
so as to pick up the water

845
01:33:51,581 --> 01:33:55,105
The men beat the soil
with their feet

846
01:33:55,681 --> 01:34:00,205
because the seeds must know
that the dance has started

847
01:34:00,581 --> 01:34:04,105
and they open their mouths and
drink the rain from heaven

848
01:34:04,581 --> 01:34:07,514
Like this, like this

849
01:34:07,914 --> 01:34:10,039
I don't have anything
to teach them,

850
01:34:10,814 --> 01:34:15,247
but I think I can learn
something from that one!

851
01:34:15,982 --> 01:34:18,140
Excuse me, excuse me!

852
01:34:18,682 --> 01:34:22,546
Music always seems to be about
to tell you a secret, but then...

853
01:34:25,949 --> 01:34:28,313
Eugenio, Eugenio,
what are you doing?

854
01:34:31,216 --> 01:34:34,273
Don't make me afraid!
Answer me! Eugenio

855
01:34:49,016 --> 01:34:49,879
Is it over?

856
01:34:50,749 --> 01:34:55,114
The object of this dance
is to befriend the elemental spirits

857
01:34:55,350 --> 01:34:57,612
who control the growth
of the seeds

858
01:34:59,116 --> 01:35:02,139
Please, don't lie to me.
Don't act like a child.

859
01:35:02,383 --> 01:35:05,941
- But I didn't sign up, I swear!
- Don't swear at your mother!

860
01:35:06,084 --> 01:35:08,481
She's not my protegee. I don't
care about Righini Biagetti

861
01:35:08,617 --> 01:35:11,777
But you do. I don't question
your taste! Everyone wonders

862
01:35:11,917 --> 01:35:14,940
how a handsome man like you can
lose his head for Righini B.!

863
01:35:45,385 --> 01:35:48,215
- What about us?
- No

864
01:35:55,886 --> 01:35:57,852
Mrs. Dongby, may I have
this dance?

865
01:35:59,086 --> 01:36:02,745
Listen, I think I've got the
right to do what I want and

866
01:36:02,886 --> 01:36:05,943
to give all the lighters in
the world to whoever I wish

867
01:36:06,086 --> 01:36:07,609
That sailor reminds me of
a cousin of mine

868
01:36:07,753 --> 01:36:10,651
Can't I give him a present? I
won't have my feelings checked

869
01:36:10,787 --> 01:36:14,184
or be controlled day and night
as if I were a child

870
01:36:14,353 --> 01:36:17,218
I'm forty years old,
leave me alone!

871
01:36:23,753 --> 01:36:25,651
- Dorotea!
- Good evening

872
01:36:27,354 --> 01:36:28,910
Sir, miss

873
01:36:29,721 --> 01:36:31,482
- May I have the honor of...
- No!

874
01:36:33,788 --> 01:36:35,879
Please! Thank you

875
01:36:52,155 --> 01:36:55,883
Stop it now, Mother.
Sit down, please

876
01:39:25,428 --> 01:39:29,554
Piltro, Piltro, a battleship!

877
01:39:58,363 --> 01:40:00,556
Open, Open!

878
01:40:21,364 --> 01:40:22,193
What are they signaling?

879
01:40:25,364 --> 01:40:27,330
It's the flagship of the
Austro-Hungarian fleet

880
01:40:28,065 --> 01:40:30,553
they want us to surrender the
Serbians we picked up

881
01:40:31,397 --> 01:40:32,227
We'll send them
a telegraph

882
01:40:50,098 --> 01:40:53,496
The refugees will be taken by
the officers of the battleship

883
01:41:03,099 --> 01:41:07,054
Why are you so worried? It's an
Austro-Hungarian battleship, so?

884
01:41:18,700 --> 01:41:19,927
What does the youngster say?

885
01:41:20,067 --> 01:41:21,965
He says we'll all be
made prisoners

886
01:41:22,100 --> 01:41:24,089
that you'll have to deliver
all of us

887
01:41:25,067 --> 01:41:26,397
Excuse me, now let's see

888
01:41:29,933 --> 01:41:30,729
Captain

889
01:42:01,668 --> 01:42:04,930
There is an exchange with the
Austro-Hungarian battleship

890
01:42:05,368 --> 01:42:10,063
- What do they say?
- I haven't intercepted them

891
01:42:11,369 --> 01:42:12,732
Why are these people so afraid?

892
01:42:21,169 --> 01:42:24,431
They tell me to bide my time.
To keep them in the forecastle

893
01:42:24,636 --> 01:42:25,795
- Yes sir!
- Captain

894
01:42:25,936 --> 01:42:28,868
The situation is as follows:
we're signaling

895
01:42:29,003 --> 01:42:30,992
but I don't know the contents
of the messages

896
01:42:31,237 --> 01:42:32,998
We should calm
the gentlemen down

897
01:42:33,803 --> 01:42:36,769
The captain seems calm to me,
doesn't he?

898
01:42:37,703 --> 01:42:40,431
You, Mr. Orlando, how do you
interpret the events?

899
01:42:42,203 --> 01:42:45,966
- Are you also being mysterious?
- Look, right there!

900
01:42:46,303 --> 01:42:48,633
On the forecastle
of the battleship

901
01:42:48,770 --> 01:42:51,429
You can see the signaler's
flags moving

902
01:42:55,637 --> 01:42:58,126
I cannot accept their demand
to hand over the refugees

903
01:42:58,271 --> 01:42:59,066
Transmit that

904
01:43:37,739 --> 01:43:39,000
"Hand them over immediately!"

905
01:44:07,607 --> 01:44:10,903
- Ah, the Grand Duke.
- Good day

906
01:44:11,040 --> 01:44:13,131
The captain is waiting
for you on the forecastle

907
01:44:27,008 --> 01:44:31,202
Y.H., the Austrian ship demands
immediate delivery of the Serbs

908
01:44:31,375 --> 01:44:33,204
Indicate that I'm on board

909
01:44:33,375 --> 01:44:34,671
and the object of this trip

910
01:44:35,275 --> 01:44:38,173
His Highness wishes to let them
know the object of this trip

911
01:44:38,709 --> 01:44:41,368
Signal to the battleship that we
must get to the island of Erimo

912
01:44:41,508 --> 01:44:43,804
- Yes, sir!
- Please, Your Highness

913
01:45:00,276 --> 01:45:01,367
Please, I want to see

914
01:45:29,110 --> 01:45:32,599
They allow us to get to the
island and send the Duke greetings

915
01:45:32,744 --> 01:45:35,938
"They allow us to get to the island
and send the Duke greetings"

916
01:45:36,911 --> 01:45:38,968
We go back on the course towards
the island, Your Highness!

917
01:45:41,844 --> 01:45:46,402
That battleship, too,
knew and loved our Edmea?

918
01:45:47,745 --> 01:45:50,643
The Grand Duke obtained from
the Austrian admiralty

919
01:45:51,011 --> 01:45:54,967
a truce to let us perform
our funeral rite

920
01:45:56,578 --> 01:45:59,476
In a short time we'll see

921
01:45:59,712 --> 01:46:01,008
the island of Erimo

922
01:46:20,746 --> 01:46:24,201
- And remove that daisy!
- You're in a mood

923
01:47:30,482 --> 01:47:31,948
One day she told me this:

924
01:47:32,716 --> 01:47:34,545
"You always talk of my voice,

925
01:47:35,483 --> 01:47:38,142
"but sometimes I'm almost sure
it's not really mine

926
01:47:39,049 --> 01:47:40,572
"I'm a voice,

927
01:47:41,116 --> 01:47:42,911
"a diaphragm, breathing

928
01:47:44,516 --> 01:47:46,311
"I don't know where the voice
comes from

929
01:47:48,850 --> 01:47:52,782
"I'm just an instrument,
a simple girl

930
01:47:54,316 --> 01:47:57,976
"who's even been afraid of this
voice that all my life and

931
01:47:58,750 --> 01:48:00,773
"forced me to do what it wanted

932
01:48:09,251 --> 01:48:12,308
- Squad, halt!
- Excuse me, Mr. Dongby,

933
01:48:12,784 --> 01:48:15,182
- The ceremony's begun!
- To your left!

934
01:48:16,618 --> 01:48:18,584
Mr. Partexano, proceed

935
01:48:23,784 --> 01:48:24,772
Attention!

936
01:48:28,818 --> 01:48:29,977
Hats off!

937
01:48:36,552 --> 01:48:40,541
Psalm of David:
"The Lord is my Shepherd

938
01:48:41,052 --> 01:48:42,483
"I shall not want

939
01:48:43,019 --> 01:48:45,883
"He makes me lie down
in green pastures

940
01:48:46,419 --> 01:48:48,647
"He leads me beside quiet water

941
01:48:48,952 --> 01:48:51,214
"He restores my soul

942
01:48:51,553 --> 01:48:54,018
"He guides me in the paths
of righteousness

943
01:48:54,219 --> 01:48:56,310
"for His name's sake. Lord,

944
01:48:56,586 --> 01:48:58,018
"listen to my prayer

945
01:48:58,519 --> 01:49:01,077
"You know Man is only dust
and ashes

946
01:49:01,386 --> 01:49:04,716
"Dust to dust, ashes to ashes

947
01:49:05,720 --> 01:49:09,118
"The Lord will protect my exit
and my entrance

948
01:49:09,387 --> 01:49:11,285
"From now on, and for all
eternity"

949
01:49:14,354 --> 01:49:17,013
- Proceed.
- On the broadside!

950
01:49:18,120 --> 01:49:18,950
Sailor!

951
01:49:27,887 --> 01:49:28,818
Come, madame

952
01:49:34,988 --> 01:49:37,216
Proceed, madame. Spread the
ashes on the cushion

953
01:51:45,426 --> 01:51:46,517
Hats on!

954
01:51:48,760 --> 01:51:49,987
To your right!

955
01:51:51,693 --> 01:51:55,716
On the left row, go on, march!

956
01:52:06,794 --> 01:52:08,384
Count von Huppenback

957
01:52:10,427 --> 01:52:13,053
please go into your cabin

958
01:52:13,228 --> 01:52:15,625
and stay there until
further orders

959
01:52:18,495 --> 01:52:23,120
- What do you mean, sir?
- By Order of the Princess,

960
01:52:23,929 --> 01:52:25,394
you're under arrest!

961
01:52:44,862 --> 01:52:48,590
It would be lovely
if at this point the

962
01:52:48,730 --> 01:52:55,129
commotion would've also touched
the hearts of the Austrians

963
01:53:01,530 --> 01:53:05,622
and their battleship
would sail away

964
01:53:07,397 --> 01:53:10,625
sending a touching salute

965
01:53:12,831 --> 01:53:13,922
But it didn't happen like that

966
01:53:15,464 --> 01:53:19,090
They wanted the Serbs back,
and how!

967
01:53:22,797 --> 01:53:24,729
And it would have been
even more beautiful

968
01:53:26,131 --> 01:53:28,790
if we, faced with such arrogance

969
01:53:29,897 --> 01:53:33,330
would have said: "No, we won't
give them up!"

970
01:53:50,932 --> 01:53:54,057
No, we won't give them up!

971
01:54:31,634 --> 01:54:33,930
On the other hand, the battleship
had to arrest the Serbs

972
01:54:34,667 --> 01:54:36,497
It was an order from the
Austro-Hungarian police

973
01:54:36,834 --> 01:54:39,767
and the Grand Duke of Herzog
was aboard, representing

974
01:54:40,134 --> 01:54:42,430
the Austro-Hungarian empire!

975
01:55:45,104 --> 01:55:46,070
Mirko!

976
01:57:51,177 --> 01:57:52,234
As I was telling you

977
01:58:01,078 --> 01:58:04,703
It's almost impossible to recall
the sequence of events

978
01:58:05,279 --> 01:58:07,302
It seems that everything was
caused by the rashness

979
01:58:07,445 --> 01:58:13,378
of the young Serb terrorist who
hurled the bomb against the ship

980
01:58:15,646 --> 01:58:19,578
Can such a primitive and rough
hand bomb

981
01:58:20,079 --> 01:58:23,136
hurled by a youngster cause a
historical catastrophe?

982
01:58:24,280 --> 01:58:28,337
Are we certain that it was
the boy who threw the bomb?

983
01:58:29,113 --> 01:58:31,443
If he was living a love story,

984
01:58:31,780 --> 01:58:33,939
why did he run towards
his own destruction?

985
01:58:35,813 --> 01:58:41,746
Apparently he did. The bomb seems
to have been thrown into the ship

986
01:58:42,114 --> 01:58:44,841
and it exploded under the barrel
of a gun,

987
01:58:49,481 --> 01:58:51,777
automatically causing a fire

988
01:58:53,748 --> 01:58:58,579
Others say that they're
sure that automatically

989
01:58:58,848 --> 01:59:01,474
the first gunshot triggered
off the fire

990
01:59:01,615 --> 01:59:03,478
in the whole battery of the
enormous battleship

991
01:59:04,715 --> 01:59:08,613
Others say that it wasn't the
Serb terrorist, nor the bomb,

992
01:59:09,415 --> 01:59:12,314
but the battleship did it
on purpose

993
01:59:12,582 --> 01:59:16,071
to bring about
an international incident

994
01:59:17,949 --> 01:59:21,643
There's a fourth version, which
I haven't got the guts to tell

995
01:59:23,349 --> 01:59:24,508
Apparently

996
02:00:27,687 --> 02:00:31,084
Gentlemen, listen: you can save
yourselves, follow our orders!

997
02:03:35,131 --> 02:03:37,097
Just a few remarks
before I finish:

998
02:03:37,563 --> 02:03:42,360
I want to tell you that many of
the people you met were saved

999
02:03:43,197 --> 02:03:46,857
A ship rescued the survivors
in the lifeboat

1000
02:03:47,164 --> 02:03:48,858
The lifeboat was
the "North Star"

1001
02:03:49,032 --> 02:03:51,191
and appeared miraculously

1002
02:03:52,631 --> 02:03:54,859
Unfortunately, I've heard
nothing more of the others

1003
02:03:57,898 --> 02:03:59,125
As for myself

1004
02:04:00,532 --> 02:04:02,896
I've got great news

1005
02:04:04,532 --> 02:04:09,056
Did you know that rhino milk
is first-class?
