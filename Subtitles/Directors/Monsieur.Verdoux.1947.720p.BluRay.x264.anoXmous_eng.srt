1
00:01:48,128 --> 00:01:49,408
<i>Good evening.</i>

2
00:01:49,629 --> 00:01:51,871
<i>As you see, my name is Henri Verdoux.</i>

3
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:56,170
<i>For 30 years, I was a bank clerk,</i>
<i>until the Depression of 1930,</i>

4
00:01:56,386 --> 00:01:58,793
<i>when I found myself unemployed.</i>

5
00:01:59,013 --> 00:02:03,640
<i>Then I became occupied in liquidating</i>
<i>members of the opposite sex.</i>

6
00:02:03,852 --> 00:02:08,560
<i>It was a strictly business enterprise</i>
<i>to support a home and family.</i>

7
00:02:08,773 --> 00:02:13,519
<i>Let me assure you, the career of</i>
<i>a Bluebeard is by no means profitable.</i>

8
00:02:13,736 --> 00:02:18,398
<i>Only a person with undaunted optimism</i>
<i>would embark on such a venture.</i>

9
00:02:18,616 --> 00:02:20,609
<i>Unfortunately, I did.</i>

10
00:02:20,827 --> 00:02:22,736
<i>What follows is history.</i>

11
00:02:58,281 --> 00:02:59,277
Jean?

12
00:02:59,491 --> 00:03:02,990
- What?
- Postman. Might be from your sister.

13
00:03:03,203 --> 00:03:04,282
Yes, it might.

14
00:03:04,496 --> 00:03:06,951
Can't you put that book down and see?

15
00:03:07,165 --> 00:03:08,161
I can't.

16
00:03:08,374 --> 00:03:10,450
Don't talk that way to your sister.

17
00:03:10,668 --> 00:03:13,041
Close your mouth. It causes a draft.

18
00:03:13,254 --> 00:03:16,919
- Do as you're told!
- He won't do a thing, Phoebe.

19
00:03:17,133 --> 00:03:19,126
- He should have to!
- Who'll make me?

20
00:03:19,344 --> 00:03:21,669
If your father was alive,
he'd make you.

21
00:03:22,889 --> 00:03:25,925
Keep your big feet to yourself,
not all over the floor.

22
00:03:26,142 --> 00:03:28,099
What about your two submarines?

23
00:03:28,311 --> 00:03:29,770
Get up. Do as you're told!

24
00:03:29,979 --> 00:03:31,972
Get your husband up. I'm reading.

25
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:34,645
Don't bother. I'll do it, Carlotta.

26
00:03:41,866 --> 00:03:43,989
There. Now, look what you've done!

27
00:03:44,202 --> 00:03:46,954
If you'd gone,
it wouldn't have happened.

28
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,822
Alright, I'll answer it.

29
00:03:51,126 --> 00:03:53,830
- Hold this.
- Phoebe, be more careful.

30
00:03:54,045 --> 00:03:55,788
It was an accident.

31
00:03:56,005 --> 00:03:59,042
- Look where you're going.
- You should both look!

32
00:03:59,259 --> 00:04:03,636
- I did. Lena got in the way.
- Alright, don't shriek.

33
00:04:05,723 --> 00:04:07,266
Hey, what the -

34
00:04:07,475 --> 00:04:10,891
- You old fool!
- Don't insult me. I'm not your wife.

35
00:04:11,104 --> 00:04:13,476
No, one's enough in this family.

36
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:16,181
If you don't like this family,
you can go.

37
00:04:17,026 --> 00:04:19,399
Don't worry, some day I'll do it.

38
00:04:20,822 --> 00:04:24,025
- What is it, anyway?
- From the Paris National Bank.

39
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:34,163
- I knew it.
- Now what?

40
00:04:34,377 --> 00:04:36,749
- The bank returned our letter.
- Letter?

41
00:04:36,963 --> 00:04:40,830
To Thelma. She's closed her account
and left no address.

42
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:43,043
- We should tell the police.
- Why?

43
00:04:43,261 --> 00:04:46,630
It's not like Thelma
to cut herself off from her family.

44
00:04:46,848 --> 00:04:49,173
Thelma can take care of herself.

45
00:04:49,392 --> 00:04:51,930
A woman of 50 flitting off to Paris,

46
00:04:52,145 --> 00:04:54,636
marrying a man she's known two weeks?

47
00:04:54,856 --> 00:04:58,806
- Don't run to the police.
- We've had no word in three months.

48
00:04:59,027 --> 00:05:01,399
So what? She's on her honeymoon.

49
00:05:01,613 --> 00:05:03,439
Hah! Honeymoon.

50
00:05:03,656 --> 00:05:06,527
Who'd honeymoon
three months with Thelma?

51
00:05:06,743 --> 00:05:10,741
I don't like her withdrawing
all her money. That's not Thelma.

52
00:05:10,955 --> 00:05:14,823
- He's got it all by now.
- He'd have a job to get it from her.

53
00:05:15,043 --> 00:05:17,082
Look what he's done already.

54
00:05:17,295 --> 00:05:21,708
She's left home, sold her business
and married him, all in two weeks.

55
00:05:21,925 --> 00:05:24,001
He must have a way with women.

56
00:05:24,219 --> 00:05:26,092
I'd like to know his technique.

57
00:05:26,304 --> 00:05:29,091
You're condemning a man
you haven't even met.

58
00:05:29,307 --> 00:05:32,261
If he were honest,
he wouldn't avoid us.

59
00:05:32,477 --> 00:05:35,050
Something terrible's
happened to Thelma!

60
00:05:35,271 --> 00:05:37,430
You make me tired, all of you.

61
00:05:37,649 --> 00:05:40,733
No letter,
so she's been robbed or murdered.

62
00:05:40,944 --> 00:05:44,776
- Nobody said she was murdered.
- We hope.

63
00:05:44,989 --> 00:05:47,278
We ought to go to the police now!

64
00:05:47,492 --> 00:05:50,493
You'd better wait.
You're all hysterical.

65
00:05:51,371 --> 00:05:55,238
I think Pierre's right.
Let's wait a day or two.

66
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:58,376
If we don't hear from her,
we'll go to the police.

67
00:05:58,586 --> 00:06:02,204
Hey, we have a picture
of that husband of hers. Where is it?

68
00:06:02,423 --> 00:06:05,045
I've got it... right here.

69
00:06:11,891 --> 00:06:13,516
Funny-looking.

70
00:06:17,397 --> 00:06:21,097
Must be a good salesman
to sell anything with that face.

71
00:06:49,387 --> 00:06:52,554
How long's he going
to keep that incinerator burning?

72
00:06:52,765 --> 00:06:54,592
It's been going for three days.

73
00:06:54,809 --> 00:06:57,763
I haven't been able
to put my washing out.

74
00:07:03,443 --> 00:07:04,439
Oo-la-la!

75
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:08,443
You'll be stepped on. Be careful.

76
00:07:12,368 --> 00:07:13,779
There.

77
00:07:46,694 --> 00:07:48,734
- Good morning, Monsieur.
- Good morning.

78
00:07:48,947 --> 00:07:52,232
I have a registered letter
for Madame Thelma Varnay.

79
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:53,861
Thank you.

80
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:58,490
Oh, no.
Madame will have to sign for it.

81
00:07:58,706 --> 00:08:00,782
Oh, I see. Just a moment.

82
00:08:02,085 --> 00:08:07,043
Thelma, darling. A registered letter,
my dear. You must sign for it.

83
00:08:08,007 --> 00:08:11,507
Don't bother to get out of the bath.
Just dry your hands.

84
00:08:11,719 --> 00:08:13,759
There. Here's a pencil.

85
00:08:15,431 --> 00:08:17,471
There, that's it.

86
00:08:18,059 --> 00:08:20,348
Be careful now you don't catch cold.

87
00:08:24,858 --> 00:08:25,853
There.

88
00:08:26,067 --> 00:08:29,103
- Thank you, Monsieur. Good morning.
- Good morning.

89
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,501
"Madame, enclosed is 60,000 francs
as requested,

90
00:08:45,712 --> 00:08:48,713
which terminates
your account at this bank."

91
00:08:48,923 --> 00:08:52,458
"Thank you for your patronage.
Banque du Midi et de Marseille"

92
00:09:21,539 --> 00:09:23,164
Long distance, please.

93
00:09:23,374 --> 00:09:27,871
I want Balong & Company,
Paris Stock Exchange, Reaumur 65 72.

94
00:10:10,046 --> 00:10:11,457
Good morning, Monsieur.

95
00:10:11,673 --> 00:10:16,500
- From the Dupont Employment Agency.
- Ah, yes. Come in, come in.

96
00:10:16,719 --> 00:10:19,175
- Your references?
- Oui, Monsieur.

97
00:10:19,389 --> 00:10:22,343
- You know it is only a day or so?
- Oui, Monsieur.

98
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:24,101
- Your name?
- Louise.

99
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:28,059
Start by cleaning out the drawers
and dusting.

100
00:10:28,273 --> 00:10:32,140
Before you dust, take down
the curtains and pack them in there.

101
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:36,061
Leave everything on the sideboard.
I'll inventory it later.

102
00:10:36,281 --> 00:10:38,569
Go on with your work. I'll answer it.

103
00:10:48,084 --> 00:10:50,290
Hello? Balong & Company?

104
00:10:52,547 --> 00:10:54,919
This is Monsieur Verdoux.

105
00:10:55,133 --> 00:10:57,172
I'll buy at opening prices
tomorrow,

106
00:10:57,385 --> 00:11:01,964
500 shares of Continental Gas,
500 shares of Consolidated Copper

107
00:11:02,182 --> 00:11:04,969
and 100 shares of Central Carbine,

108
00:11:05,185 --> 00:11:07,972
the same 20-point margin, yes.

109
00:11:08,188 --> 00:11:11,473
I'm wiring the money.
It'll be there in the morning.

110
00:11:11,691 --> 00:11:13,518
Correct. Au revoir.

111
00:11:18,156 --> 00:11:21,904
She no sooner married him
than she disappeared completely.

112
00:11:22,118 --> 00:11:24,692
Do we have
any way of identifying him?

113
00:11:24,913 --> 00:11:29,907
We had a photo of him, but Lena
threw it in the fireplace by mistake.

114
00:11:30,126 --> 00:11:31,324
Too bad.

115
00:11:31,544 --> 00:11:34,415
- I'd know him if I ever saw him.
- So would I.

116
00:11:34,631 --> 00:11:37,252
I believe
we have all the particulars.

117
00:11:37,467 --> 00:11:39,958
If we get anything,
we will let you know.

118
00:11:40,178 --> 00:11:42,005
Merci, Monsieur.

119
00:11:42,222 --> 00:11:44,345
- Good day, Mesdames.
- Good day, Monsieur.

120
00:11:44,557 --> 00:11:47,048
- Monsieur.
- Monsieur.

121
00:11:52,023 --> 00:11:54,063
- What's on your mind?
- Funny.

122
00:11:54,275 --> 00:11:57,609
In three years, 12 women have
disappeared from these cities.

123
00:11:57,821 --> 00:12:00,821
The history of each case
is similar to this one.

124
00:12:01,032 --> 00:12:02,028
How?

125
00:12:02,242 --> 00:12:05,907
They are all middle-aged,
with a small income or property.

126
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:09,074
They nearly all married
the same type of man.

127
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:13,537
- He's the husband of all of them?
- It looks that way to me.

128
00:12:13,753 --> 00:12:16,671
Looks like he was married
to several at once.

129
00:12:16,881 --> 00:12:21,093
He's the proverbial sailor.
With him, it's a wife in every port.

130
00:12:21,302 --> 00:12:23,342
- What's his racket?
- I don't know.

131
00:12:23,555 --> 00:12:26,556
- Insurance?
- No, he's too smart for that.

132
00:12:26,766 --> 00:12:30,716
- None of these women has shown up.
- Murdered them?

133
00:12:30,937 --> 00:12:33,606
That's just it. He's a "Bluebeard".

134
00:12:33,815 --> 00:12:36,436
A mass killer,
operating all over the country.

135
00:12:36,651 --> 00:12:41,562
Hold on. Before you tell the public
that, you'd better get more facts.

136
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:59,537
- M. Varnay?
- At your service, Monsieur.

137
00:12:59,757 --> 00:13:01,797
M. Nutal, the real estate agent.

138
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:03,883
Mme Grosnay, M. Varnay.

139
00:13:05,472 --> 00:13:07,511
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

140
00:13:07,724 --> 00:13:11,556
Madame would like to see your house,
if it's not inconvenient.

141
00:13:11,769 --> 00:13:13,809
By no means. Won't you come in?

142
00:13:19,194 --> 00:13:21,815
You'll pardon me,
I'm all disheveled.

143
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:25,399
I haven't had time to brush up
or do a thing.

144
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:30,492
- Oh, what lovely roses.
- From my garden.

145
00:13:30,705 --> 00:13:32,994
Oh, they're divine.

146
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:34,618
- Louise.
- Oui, Monsieur.

147
00:13:34,834 --> 00:13:37,076
Will you wrap these roses
for Mme Grosnay?

148
00:13:37,295 --> 00:13:41,507
- You'll find paper in the drawer.
- Oui, Monsieur.

149
00:13:41,716 --> 00:13:44,385
Oh, no,
you'll want them for yourself.

150
00:13:44,594 --> 00:13:49,055
Madame, I want them appreciated.
I therefore give them to you.

151
00:13:50,099 --> 00:13:51,724
This way, please.

152
00:13:57,065 --> 00:14:02,486
The sitting room, solid oak doors
and floors, mahogany wainscoting.

153
00:14:02,695 --> 00:14:05,365
- It's perfect, architecturally.
- Thank you.

154
00:14:05,573 --> 00:14:09,571
We have a lovely view
of the mountains and the sea below.

155
00:14:09,786 --> 00:14:12,407
Oh, those beautiful hills.

156
00:14:12,622 --> 00:14:14,662
The work of the Supreme Architect.

157
00:14:14,874 --> 00:14:17,448
I'm afraid
we can't compete with that.

158
00:14:18,837 --> 00:14:21,541
There's the garden - 175 feet by 85.

159
00:14:21,756 --> 00:14:26,085
Three apple trees, two pears, one
plum and a mulberry, and my roses.

160
00:14:26,302 --> 00:14:27,927
Quite an atmosphere.

161
00:14:28,138 --> 00:14:30,925
My wife put so much of herself
in this house.

162
00:14:31,141 --> 00:14:34,344
We were supremely happy here.
I think one feels that.

163
00:14:34,561 --> 00:14:37,099
Yes, indeed.
May I offer my condolences?

164
00:14:37,313 --> 00:14:39,555
- Pardon?
- The loss of your wife.

165
00:14:39,774 --> 00:14:42,609
Ah, yes. It was very sudden.

166
00:14:42,819 --> 00:14:45,025
A heart attack while visiting family.

167
00:14:45,238 --> 00:14:49,318
That's why I must give up this house,
get away from the memory of it.

168
00:14:49,534 --> 00:14:51,361
You will pardon me, I trust.

169
00:14:52,537 --> 00:14:54,364
We'll get it for nothing.

170
00:14:54,581 --> 00:14:56,620
Call again. I'm very busy.

171
00:15:00,003 --> 00:15:01,627
This way, please.

172
00:15:06,718 --> 00:15:09,754
The dining room
and to the left, the library.

173
00:15:12,307 --> 00:15:14,050
Cozy, hm?

174
00:15:14,267 --> 00:15:15,678
Yes.

175
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,105
Uh, this way please, upstairs.

176
00:15:26,779 --> 00:15:29,697
It's small
and requires very little to keep up.

177
00:15:29,908 --> 00:15:32,778
We never had a servant,
but there's a maid's room.

178
00:15:32,994 --> 00:15:34,536
I have a maid and a cook.

179
00:15:34,746 --> 00:15:38,245
An extra bed in the maid's room
if they're females

180
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:43,749
or one of the rooms upstairs,
unless you want it for your family.

181
00:15:43,963 --> 00:15:46,585
- No family.
- Just you and your husband?

182
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,215
No, my husband has been dead
for many years.

183
00:15:50,428 --> 00:15:52,053
Indeed?

184
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:55,968
This way, please.

185
00:15:56,184 --> 00:15:59,220
- M. Varnay?
- Yes?

186
00:15:59,437 --> 00:16:02,474
Telephone for M. Nutal
from his office.

187
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:06,309
- Will you excuse me?
- Plaisir.

188
00:16:07,904 --> 00:16:09,861
This was my wife's bedroom.

189
00:16:10,073 --> 00:16:12,149
We called - uh, pardon me.

190
00:16:18,414 --> 00:16:22,578
Yes, we called it our Sans-Souci.
Ah, she loved this room.

191
00:16:22,794 --> 00:16:25,629
- She spent most of her time here.
- Very sunny.

192
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:28,543
We loved sun.
Some don't like it in the bedroom.

193
00:16:28,758 --> 00:16:30,798
- Oh, I do.
- Scorpio.

194
00:16:31,928 --> 00:16:35,629
- I beg your pardon?
- Your astrological sign.

195
00:16:35,849 --> 00:16:39,383
- No, Aries.
- Ah, yes, of course.

196
00:16:39,602 --> 00:16:43,552
Sky and sun - a dreamer.
It's in your eyes.

197
00:16:43,773 --> 00:16:47,937
Deep pools of desire that can never
be fulfilled or understood.

198
00:16:48,153 --> 00:16:51,153
- Very interesting.
- You are very interesting.

199
00:16:51,364 --> 00:16:55,148
I'm also Aries. I know all about us.
We are old souls.

200
00:16:55,368 --> 00:16:58,986
Strange you should come on this day.
I feel it's destiny.

201
00:16:59,205 --> 00:17:02,325
- Indeed.
- If I knew you better, I'd explain.

202
00:17:02,542 --> 00:17:03,740
Please do.

203
00:17:04,627 --> 00:17:07,581
- However, you never married again?
- No.

204
00:17:07,797 --> 00:17:10,668
Singular.
A woman of your temperament.

205
00:17:10,884 --> 00:17:11,963
Why?

206
00:17:12,177 --> 00:17:15,213
Because companionship
is so essential to Aries.

207
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:18,182
Oh, it's too late for that now.

208
00:17:18,391 --> 00:17:20,550
Nonsense. You're on life's threshold.

209
00:17:20,768 --> 00:17:23,853
One never begins to live
until one is past...

210
00:17:27,025 --> 00:17:29,064
What difference does age make?

211
00:17:29,277 --> 00:17:31,234
A great deal to a woman.

212
00:17:31,446 --> 00:17:34,779
I venture that you were never
as attractive as now.

213
00:17:34,991 --> 00:17:37,529
- You're very kind.
- No, I'm frank.

214
00:17:37,744 --> 00:17:41,160
No doubt, you were extremely
beautiful as a young girl,

215
00:17:41,372 --> 00:17:44,290
but your youth
could not compete with your age.

216
00:17:44,501 --> 00:17:48,664
Your ripeness, your luxuriousness.

217
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,371
Besides, you have more character now,

218
00:17:51,591 --> 00:17:54,296
more experience, more...

219
00:17:55,011 --> 00:17:57,051
More everything.

220
00:17:57,263 --> 00:17:59,470
- You flatter me.
- Why not?

221
00:17:59,682 --> 00:18:03,763
Why shouldn't I respond to beauty
as you did to the flowers?

222
00:18:03,978 --> 00:18:08,936
"What lovely roses," and impulsively
drew them near to your lips.

223
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:10,977
Lucky roses.

224
00:18:13,196 --> 00:18:16,481
I wish I had the courage
to act upon my impulses.

225
00:18:16,699 --> 00:18:20,365
However, life is that way. We can't.

226
00:18:20,578 --> 00:18:22,571
You are divine. You are lovely.

227
00:18:22,789 --> 00:18:25,956
Words are so futile.
I feel I've known you all my life.

228
00:18:26,167 --> 00:18:28,207
- You must -
- This is ridiculous.

229
00:18:28,419 --> 00:18:31,337
No, it's inevitable.
We can't help ourselves.

230
00:18:31,548 --> 00:18:36,008
Your loveliness inspired it.
Blame your loveliness for it.

231
00:18:36,219 --> 00:18:38,840
- Don't be silly.
- Try to understand.

232
00:18:39,055 --> 00:18:40,799
Don't embarrass me.

233
00:18:41,015 --> 00:18:44,052
Silly conventions.
This is more than a convention.

234
00:18:44,269 --> 00:18:46,510
I hate to be obvious, really.

235
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:51,680
Oh, yes, there it goes. It's a bee!
Hold still, I'll get it!

236
00:18:51,901 --> 00:18:53,728
Isn't that silly?

237
00:19:01,161 --> 00:19:02,655
Are you hurt?

238
00:19:02,871 --> 00:19:05,112
- I must have slipped.
- No doubt.

239
00:19:05,331 --> 00:19:07,822
- I think we'd better go.
- I think we had.

240
00:19:08,042 --> 00:19:11,992
- Will you see the other rooms?
- No, thank you. We've seen enough.

241
00:19:12,213 --> 00:19:15,463
That is, unless Madame
would like to see more.

242
00:19:15,675 --> 00:19:17,549
- No, thank you.
- Very well.

243
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,927
When Mme Grosnay decides,
we'll be in touch.

244
00:19:21,139 --> 00:19:25,302
Yes, I'd like to send you a book
on astrology, if you're interested.

245
00:19:25,518 --> 00:19:26,514
Don't bother.

246
00:19:26,728 --> 00:19:29,053
No bother
if I know how to get in touch.

247
00:19:29,272 --> 00:19:32,356
- Through our office.
- As you wish.

248
00:19:45,288 --> 00:19:48,491
Ah, your roses!
Don't forget your roses.

249
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:50,416
Thank you. I'd rather not.

250
00:19:50,627 --> 00:19:54,541
Madame, I shall be deeply grieved
if you don't accept them.

251
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,216
Thank you.

252
00:19:57,425 --> 00:19:59,916
- Au revoir, Madame.
- Oh. Au revoir.

253
00:20:00,136 --> 00:20:02,176
- 'Voir.
- 'Voir.

254
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:44,926
Flowers? Boutonnières?

255
00:21:09,747 --> 00:21:11,870
Mme Yvonne. So nice to see you.

256
00:21:18,423 --> 00:21:21,092
- Flower, Monsieur?
- Give me that one.

257
00:21:23,761 --> 00:21:26,881
- Well, well, M. Verdoux!
- How do you do, sir?

258
00:21:27,098 --> 00:21:29,305
It's been ages. What do you know?

259
00:21:29,517 --> 00:21:33,811
- I don't even suspect anything.
- Merci.

260
00:21:34,022 --> 00:21:36,061
- You are finished?
- Sit down.

261
00:21:36,274 --> 00:21:40,224
Merci. M. Lavine, M. Verdoux -
an old friend of mine.

262
00:21:40,445 --> 00:21:42,568
- How do you do?
- We worked together.

263
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,654
He was a bank cashier.

264
00:21:44,866 --> 00:21:47,986
- In the good old days.
- Not so long ago.

265
00:21:48,203 --> 00:21:50,907
- About three years ago.
- What do you do now?

266
00:21:51,122 --> 00:21:53,827
A bit of everything -
real estate, stock market.

267
00:21:54,042 --> 00:21:56,118
You must have made a killing.

268
00:21:56,336 --> 00:21:58,957
- Yes.
- The market's low now, isn't it?

269
00:21:59,172 --> 00:22:01,211
Buy now when everybody's selling.

270
00:22:02,926 --> 00:22:05,595
- Can I offer you something?
- No, merci.

271
00:22:06,387 --> 00:22:08,676
- Then if you'll pardon me.
- Of course.

272
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:12,759
- Good day, gentlemen.
- Good day.

273
00:22:12,977 --> 00:22:15,978
Oh, Monsieur, don't forget this.

274
00:22:16,189 --> 00:22:18,063
Merci. Merci.

275
00:22:22,737 --> 00:22:24,896
Poor old Verdoux.

276
00:22:25,114 --> 00:22:26,941
Seems to be doing well.

277
00:22:27,158 --> 00:22:30,574
- He got a pretty raw deal.
- What do you mean?

278
00:22:30,787 --> 00:22:32,863
Was with us for over 30 years.

279
00:22:33,081 --> 00:22:37,458
Along came the Depression
and he was one of the first to go.

280
00:22:37,669 --> 00:22:39,661
Yes, after 30 years.

281
00:22:45,426 --> 00:22:47,466
Well, well, there you are.

282
00:22:48,179 --> 00:22:50,468
Let's see what we have for you.

283
00:23:16,708 --> 00:23:18,332
Henri Verdoux, Furniture Dealer.

284
00:23:18,543 --> 00:23:21,663
Balong & Company.
We've been trying you for an hour.

285
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,750
The market's dropped.
We need 50,000 francs.

286
00:23:24,966 --> 00:23:28,300
- When?
<i>- In the morning, at market opening.</i>

287
00:23:28,511 --> 00:23:30,967
50,000 francs by tomorrow morning?

288
00:23:31,181 --> 00:23:32,805
If not, you'll be wiped out.

289
00:23:33,975 --> 00:23:35,802
I'll see what I can do.

290
00:23:36,936 --> 00:23:38,763
Oh, dear.

291
00:23:39,981 --> 00:23:42,270
Oh, me. Oh, me.

292
00:23:44,152 --> 00:23:46,690
Ah, Lydia, the City of Corbell.

293
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:51,906
Let's see,
in Corbell the banks close at four.

294
00:23:54,078 --> 00:23:55,703
C, C, C.

295
00:24:01,211 --> 00:24:02,373
Corbell.

296
00:24:02,587 --> 00:24:05,623
If I leave now, I can catch the 2: 15
and be there by 3:30.

297
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:06,871
That gives me half an hour.

298
00:24:15,391 --> 00:24:17,218
The banks close at four.

299
00:24:20,855 --> 00:24:22,100
Lydia!

300
00:24:23,358 --> 00:24:26,193
I thought you were in Indochina.

301
00:24:26,402 --> 00:24:30,068
- I was, my dear, I was.
- Don't "dear" me.

302
00:24:32,575 --> 00:24:35,280
Three months you've been away
and not a word.

303
00:24:35,495 --> 00:24:38,946
Didn't you get my letters?
I wrote you almost every day.

304
00:24:39,165 --> 00:24:43,744
I got a telegram three months ago.
Running off and leaving me alone.

305
00:24:43,962 --> 00:24:46,916
I have to travel for business.
I'm an engineer.

306
00:24:47,132 --> 00:24:49,801
Too bad I didn't know that
before I met you.

307
00:24:50,009 --> 00:24:51,207
Lydia.

308
00:24:51,427 --> 00:24:53,586
Well, what do you want?

309
00:24:55,682 --> 00:24:58,636
- Nothing, my dear.
- That's unusual.

310
00:24:58,852 --> 00:25:02,102
I thought you might be pleased
to see me, that's all.

311
00:25:02,313 --> 00:25:03,511
Is that all?

312
00:25:03,731 --> 00:25:06,187
I only see you
when you want something.

313
00:25:07,068 --> 00:25:11,481
Lydia... I refuse to quarrel
with you, it's too ugly.

314
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:16,702
Life can so easily degenerate
into something sordid and vulgar.

315
00:25:16,911 --> 00:25:20,660
Let us try to keep it
beautiful and dignified.

316
00:25:20,874 --> 00:25:22,747
We are not young anymore.

317
00:25:22,959 --> 00:25:26,410
In the sunset of our lives,
we need companionship,

318
00:25:26,629 --> 00:25:29,037
love, tenderness.

319
00:25:30,758 --> 00:25:34,673
Most of all we need each other.
Ah, Lydia.

320
00:25:34,888 --> 00:25:39,466
We've had such beautiful,
inspiring moments together...

321
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:42,602
and we can have many more.

322
00:25:42,812 --> 00:25:45,054
I'm getting too old
for that nonsense.

323
00:25:46,524 --> 00:25:50,937
There you go - age again. I thought
I'd cured you of that complex.

324
00:25:51,154 --> 00:25:53,727
I'm cured of you,
running off like you did.

325
00:25:53,948 --> 00:25:55,988
- Lydia -
- Sit down.

326
00:25:59,537 --> 00:26:01,660
What were you doing in Indochina?

327
00:26:01,873 --> 00:26:05,408
Building bridges, my dear.
We ran into a lot of trouble.

328
00:26:05,627 --> 00:26:09,541
The super-structure was all wrong.
We had to draw up new plans.

329
00:26:09,756 --> 00:26:12,673
Then they cancelled our contract
due to the crisis.

330
00:26:12,884 --> 00:26:14,164
What crisis?

331
00:26:14,385 --> 00:26:17,589
- The financial crisis.
- What do you mean?

332
00:26:17,806 --> 00:26:21,637
The worst catastrophe in years.
Banks will collapse everywhere.

333
00:26:21,851 --> 00:26:23,511
It isn't in the newspapers.

334
00:26:23,728 --> 00:26:27,144
They're trying to keep it quiet,
but we were tipped off.

335
00:26:27,357 --> 00:26:29,433
Bah! I don't believe it.

336
00:26:29,651 --> 00:26:32,770
Don't bother your little head
about such matters.

337
00:26:33,822 --> 00:26:36,229
What do you mean, a financial crisis?

338
00:26:36,449 --> 00:26:39,071
Tomorrow there'll be a run
on every bank.

339
00:26:39,285 --> 00:26:41,527
Fiddlesticks. It's all nonsense.

340
00:26:41,746 --> 00:26:46,373
It's of no consequence to you, but
I'm vitally interested, that's all.

341
00:26:46,584 --> 00:26:50,084
- So am I.
- You have nothing to worry about.

342
00:26:50,296 --> 00:26:53,250
Every penny I have
is in ready cash in the bank.

343
00:26:53,466 --> 00:26:55,874
- You know that, you fool.
- What bank?

344
00:26:56,094 --> 00:26:57,469
The Mutual Trust.

345
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:00,929
That's the worst of all! Get it out!
What time is it?

346
00:27:01,141 --> 00:27:04,841
- Are you mad?
- Every bank will be closed tomorrow.

347
00:27:05,061 --> 00:27:07,552
- What will I do with it?
- Decide later.

348
00:27:07,772 --> 00:27:10,310
I don't want 70,000 francs
lying about.

349
00:27:10,525 --> 00:27:13,976
How much? Never mind.
Don't talk. Hurry up. Quick.

350
00:27:14,195 --> 00:27:15,571
It's a lie.

351
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:18,318
You're losing time!
The banks close at four.

352
00:27:18,533 --> 00:27:20,941
Quick, hurry! Come on, dear.

353
00:27:39,805 --> 00:27:42,296
I must be out of my mind to do this.

354
00:27:45,311 --> 00:27:46,935
You wait and see.

355
00:27:48,022 --> 00:27:52,482
- The cashier said it was nonsense.
- You expect him to say otherwise?

356
00:27:52,693 --> 00:27:54,982
I'd sooner believe him than you.

357
00:27:55,196 --> 00:27:58,315
Why couldn't I leave it
in my safe deposit box?

358
00:27:59,783 --> 00:28:04,860
A revolution might happen. New
government would confiscate it all.

359
00:28:05,539 --> 00:28:09,833
The best thing is to have it here,
where you can lay your hands on it.

360
00:28:10,044 --> 00:28:12,120
Where you can lay your hands on it.

361
00:28:13,798 --> 00:28:17,878
Lydia, you're very tired.
What you need is a good night's rest.

362
00:28:18,093 --> 00:28:20,133
I need my head examined.

363
00:28:20,346 --> 00:28:22,385
I've never heard of such a thing...

364
00:28:22,598 --> 00:28:27,343
Emptying my safe deposit box.
Burglars might break in.

365
00:28:27,561 --> 00:28:29,353
What nonsense.

366
00:28:29,563 --> 00:28:31,889
Good thing we haven't any servants.

367
00:28:32,107 --> 00:28:34,396
It's perfectly safe tonight.

368
00:28:34,985 --> 00:28:37,025
Should have been left where it was.

369
00:28:37,238 --> 00:28:40,441
Very well, if you're uneasy about it,
put it back.

370
00:28:40,658 --> 00:28:44,490
- You can do that in the morning.
- I certainly will.

371
00:28:48,707 --> 00:28:51,792
- Turn out the lights.
- Yes, my dear.

372
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:57,501
- Did you lock the doors?
- Early this evening.

373
00:28:58,384 --> 00:29:00,211
Latch the kitchen window?

374
00:29:00,427 --> 00:29:02,634
Everything's attended to.

375
00:29:02,847 --> 00:29:05,966
- Well, did you?
- Yes, my dear.

376
00:29:23,951 --> 00:29:27,154
- What a night.
- Yes, a full moon.

377
00:29:28,622 --> 00:29:32,323
How beautiful,
this pale, Endymion hour.

378
00:29:32,543 --> 00:29:34,417
What are you talking about?

379
00:29:34,628 --> 00:29:36,870
Endymion, my dear -

380
00:29:37,089 --> 00:29:39,627
a beautiful youth
possessed by the moon.

381
00:29:39,842 --> 00:29:42,333
Forget about him and get to bed.

382
00:29:44,555 --> 00:29:45,753
Yes, my dear.

383
00:29:50,603 --> 00:29:54,221
"Our feet were soft in flowers..."

384
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:02,631
Hello? Hello?
Long distance, please.

385
00:31:02,842 --> 00:31:06,626
Paris Stock Exchange,
Reaumur 65 72. Thank you.

386
00:31:41,338 --> 00:31:45,170
Hello, Balong & Company?
This is M. Verdoux.

387
00:31:45,384 --> 00:31:48,219
I'm wiring 50,000 francs.
Is that enough?

388
00:31:48,429 --> 00:31:52,723
I won't be in Paris for some time.
I have matters to clean up here.

389
00:31:54,435 --> 00:31:57,305
Very well, I'll keep in touch.
Goodbye.

390
00:32:18,459 --> 00:32:19,704
Daddy!

391
00:32:22,421 --> 00:32:23,915
Daddy!

392
00:32:48,239 --> 00:32:51,275
- Mama!
- What is it, Peter?

393
00:32:51,492 --> 00:32:54,908
- Look!
- Henri!

394
00:32:55,621 --> 00:32:57,910
- Many happy returns, Mona.
- Happy returns?

395
00:32:58,123 --> 00:33:02,667
You haven't forgotten our wedding
anniversary? 10 years ago today.

396
00:33:02,878 --> 00:33:04,254
Good heavens. Of course.

397
00:33:04,463 --> 00:33:07,879
I have more sentiment
about these things than you have.

398
00:33:08,092 --> 00:33:09,372
Henri.

399
00:33:11,053 --> 00:33:14,837
10 years, wonderful years.

400
00:33:15,766 --> 00:33:18,257
Thank you, my dear.

401
00:33:18,477 --> 00:33:21,182
- Did you bring her a present?
- Peter!

402
00:33:21,397 --> 00:33:24,018
Well, women like those things.

403
00:33:24,233 --> 00:33:28,065
However, I did bring her a present,
and here it is.

404
00:33:29,989 --> 00:33:31,780
Henri, this is wonderful.

405
00:33:31,991 --> 00:33:35,775
- They will never take it from us.
- What did you get, Mama?

406
00:33:35,995 --> 00:33:37,952
The deed to this house and garden.

407
00:33:38,164 --> 00:33:40,405
Peter? Peter?

408
00:33:40,624 --> 00:33:43,459
Here's Jeannette.
Run and get ready for supper.

409
00:33:43,669 --> 00:33:46,456
Mama, can't I dine
with you and Daddy?

410
00:33:46,672 --> 00:33:47,952
Tonight, yes.

411
00:33:53,596 --> 00:33:56,846
What a relief to get away
from the jungle fight.

412
00:33:57,057 --> 00:33:58,884
The jungle fight.

413
00:34:00,019 --> 00:34:02,510
- You're tired, Henri.
- I suppose I am.

414
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:07,558
Well, two more years at this business
and with luck, we can retire.

415
00:34:08,486 --> 00:34:13,147
If it means losing your health,
I'd sooner live in one room again.

416
00:34:15,201 --> 00:34:17,074
That, you will never do again.

417
00:34:17,286 --> 00:34:19,907
- We were happy then.
- Not now?

418
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:23,579
- Of course, but...
- But what?

419
00:34:25,503 --> 00:34:29,085
In the past three years,
ever since you left the bank,

420
00:34:29,298 --> 00:34:31,836
you've been under a terrible strain.

421
00:34:32,051 --> 00:34:33,878
Have I?

422
00:34:34,845 --> 00:34:36,256
You worry me.

423
00:34:37,598 --> 00:34:39,638
That's the last thing I wish to do.

424
00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:41,724
It's your state of mind.

425
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,930
What's wrong with it?

426
00:34:44,647 --> 00:34:46,805
You're so desperate about everything.

427
00:34:47,024 --> 00:34:51,651
These are desperate days, my dear -
millions starving and unemployed.

428
00:34:51,862 --> 00:34:55,148
It's not easy for a man of my age
to make a living.

429
00:34:55,950 --> 00:34:59,449
I know it. It's terrifying.

430
00:34:59,662 --> 00:35:03,991
However,
when the world looks grim and dark...

431
00:35:04,208 --> 00:35:06,781
then I think of another world -

432
00:35:07,002 --> 00:35:08,960
you and Peter -

433
00:35:09,171 --> 00:35:12,006
all that I love on this earth.

434
00:35:28,315 --> 00:35:29,513
There.

435
00:35:31,026 --> 00:35:32,224
May I help?

436
00:35:32,444 --> 00:35:34,686
Get the paper
and your father's slippers.

437
00:35:34,905 --> 00:35:38,191
They're here.
I got them before Daddy came home.

438
00:35:39,451 --> 00:35:40,862
Do I smell meat cooking?

439
00:35:41,078 --> 00:35:44,661
- Yes. You wanted company for dinner.
- Of course.

440
00:35:44,874 --> 00:35:46,866
Why don't we eat meat, Daddy?

441
00:35:47,084 --> 00:35:51,663
Because we are vegetarians, my son.
Are the Bottellos coming?

442
00:35:51,881 --> 00:35:53,589
- Yes.
- Good.

443
00:35:53,799 --> 00:35:57,002
- Who are the Bottellos?
- You know the Bottellos.

444
00:35:57,219 --> 00:36:00,054
The man who owns the drug store -
my good friend.

445
00:36:00,264 --> 00:36:01,889
Oh, yes.

446
00:36:02,099 --> 00:36:06,227
The Turners want you to officiate
at Wednesday's Church Bazaar.

447
00:36:06,437 --> 00:36:09,391
Sorry, I'm leaving for Lyons
in the morning.

448
00:36:09,607 --> 00:36:10,935
So soon?

449
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:13,189
Business is business, my dear.

450
00:36:14,403 --> 00:36:16,443
Peter, where did you put the paper?

451
00:36:16,655 --> 00:36:19,193
You're sitting on it, Daddy.

452
00:36:19,408 --> 00:36:21,317
Oh, so I am.

453
00:36:21,535 --> 00:36:24,536
- Give it to me. Rest your eyes.
- Thank you, my dear.

454
00:36:24,747 --> 00:36:26,704
Just read the headlines, that's all.

455
00:36:30,044 --> 00:36:34,172
"Depression Worldwide -
Unemployment spreads in all nations."

456
00:36:34,381 --> 00:36:37,466
Enough. It's too depressing.

457
00:36:38,469 --> 00:36:42,301
Just think, Henri,
how fortunate we are. You have a job.

458
00:36:43,516 --> 00:36:45,555
Yes, I have a job.

459
00:36:46,977 --> 00:36:49,931
If I lose one,
I can always find another.

460
00:36:55,694 --> 00:36:57,901
Peter, don't pull the cat's tail.

461
00:36:58,113 --> 00:37:01,198
You have a cruel streak.
Where do you get it?

462
00:37:01,408 --> 00:37:04,326
I'm only playing with him.
He likes it.

463
00:37:04,537 --> 00:37:07,288
He doesn't. You play too rough.

464
00:37:07,498 --> 00:37:11,246
Remember, violence begets violence.

465
00:37:12,878 --> 00:37:14,076
The Bottellos.

466
00:37:14,296 --> 00:37:17,001
Peter, take Papa's shoes to his room.

467
00:37:18,592 --> 00:37:22,460
Ah, Martha, my dear,
let me take your things.

468
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:27,223
And Maurice, delighted to see you,
upon my word, to be sure.

469
00:37:27,434 --> 00:37:29,344
Go inside. Go inside.

470
00:37:29,562 --> 00:37:32,266
Thank you.
You're quite a stranger, Henri.

471
00:37:32,481 --> 00:37:34,023
Yes.

472
00:37:34,233 --> 00:37:36,142
- Dear Martha.
- How do you do?

473
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,317
- Maurice.
- Mona.

474
00:37:38,529 --> 00:37:40,486
- How is your cold?
- I'm over it.

475
00:37:40,698 --> 00:37:42,690
- Did you take those pills?
- Well -

476
00:37:42,908 --> 00:37:45,031
No you didn't, but you should.

477
00:37:45,244 --> 00:37:47,949
They're analeptic -
to restore strength.

478
00:37:48,164 --> 00:37:51,449
Maurice, you know how she is
about taking medicine.

479
00:37:51,667 --> 00:37:53,956
Dinner is served, Madame.

480
00:37:55,379 --> 00:37:57,621
I give them to Martha all the time.

481
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:01,173
- She's the guinea pig of the family.
- Ah, yes.

482
00:38:01,385 --> 00:38:05,050
- Tell me, how's business?
- As usual. And yours?

483
00:38:05,264 --> 00:38:07,553
Very busy these days, very busy.

484
00:38:07,766 --> 00:38:09,925
Martha, at my left, please.

485
00:38:10,144 --> 00:38:13,513
I hope you'll be with us
a little longer this time.

486
00:38:13,731 --> 00:38:18,025
No, Maurice, I am leaving
by the first train tomorrow morning.

487
00:38:40,174 --> 00:38:43,128
- Best one yet.
- Like 'em rough? I'll go further.

488
00:38:43,344 --> 00:38:45,171
That's far enough, brother.

489
00:38:45,387 --> 00:38:49,302
That's a Lulu. I must tell it
to the captain when he comes.

490
00:38:49,517 --> 00:38:52,221
- When's he here?
- At six on the Lyon Express.

491
00:38:52,436 --> 00:38:54,310
It's almost time. We'd better blow.

492
00:38:54,522 --> 00:38:57,357
What's your hurry?
Let's have another drink.

493
00:38:57,566 --> 00:38:59,606
What's happened to that maid?

494
00:39:00,945 --> 00:39:03,649
Annette? Pardon me a moment.

495
00:39:05,783 --> 00:39:08,653
- Are you deaf?? I was shouting.
- I didn't hear.

496
00:39:08,869 --> 00:39:10,280
You didn't want to hear.

497
00:39:12,498 --> 00:39:15,119
Lamb chops?
Where's the fish from lunch?

498
00:39:15,334 --> 00:39:17,374
I threw it out. There wasn't much.

499
00:39:17,586 --> 00:39:20,836
Enough for you -
throwing food away in hard times.

500
00:39:21,048 --> 00:39:22,756
I'm sorry, I can't eat fish.

501
00:39:22,967 --> 00:39:26,133
There are plenty who can,
so pack up and get out.

502
00:39:27,638 --> 00:39:30,722
Lamb chops for dinner.
Next it'll be steak.

503
00:39:31,642 --> 00:39:34,643
- Lamb chops and steak!
- What's the trouble?

504
00:39:34,854 --> 00:39:37,392
- These servants.
- They're a problem.

505
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:42,651
This one's gone. Now the captain's
coming home and I haven't a servant.

506
00:39:42,862 --> 00:39:45,103
Look, Annabella, we'd better blow.

507
00:39:45,322 --> 00:39:48,738
What's your hurry?
You haven't told my fortune.

508
00:39:52,997 --> 00:39:54,906
Well, we'll stay till he comes.

509
00:39:55,124 --> 00:39:57,994
- Alright, now cut 'em three times.
- Yeah.

510
00:39:58,961 --> 00:40:03,006
- How long's the captain ashore?
- Just a week, then off another six.

511
00:40:03,215 --> 00:40:06,631
Six weeks?
I bet that has its good points.

512
00:40:06,844 --> 00:40:08,801
I haven't got to that stage yet.

513
00:40:09,013 --> 00:40:12,927
Look at that girl's luck.
No wonder she won a lottery.

514
00:40:13,142 --> 00:40:16,926
- Do I win another?
- I wouldn't be at all surprised.

515
00:40:17,146 --> 00:40:19,185
Wait a minute.

516
00:40:20,274 --> 00:40:22,730
Ace of spades. That ain't so lucky.

517
00:40:22,943 --> 00:40:28,816
If you slipped on a banana peel
with a bad back, the fall would help.

518
00:40:30,868 --> 00:40:32,279
The captain!

519
00:40:39,251 --> 00:40:41,493
- Louis, my pigeon.
- Annabella.

520
00:40:41,712 --> 00:40:43,503
- Why are you so late?
- Sorry.

521
00:40:43,714 --> 00:40:47,249
A southwester blew up
and landed us on a mud bank.

522
00:40:47,468 --> 00:40:49,959
We had to wait for high tide
to get off.

523
00:40:50,179 --> 00:40:52,218
Oh, you look so fresh and salty.

524
00:40:52,431 --> 00:40:53,842
Do I, darling?

525
00:40:56,101 --> 00:40:58,260
I want you to meet some friends.

526
00:40:58,479 --> 00:41:01,599
Vicki, Captain Bonheur.
I forgot your married name.

527
00:41:01,816 --> 00:41:05,185
- Darmond. Call me Vicki.
- Joe Darmond, her husband.

528
00:41:05,402 --> 00:41:08,439
How do you do? Well, we'll blow.

529
00:41:08,656 --> 00:41:10,898
I beg your pardon, I mean beat it.

530
00:41:12,827 --> 00:41:15,863
- Pleased to meet you, Captain...
- Bonheur.

531
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:19,615
Bonheur.
Well, then all I can say is bonsoir.

532
00:41:23,754 --> 00:41:25,877
- Pigeon.
- Who are those people?

533
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:27,714
Friends I met at the races.

534
00:41:27,967 --> 00:41:32,095
Be careful. You're too accessible.
You can stoop and pick up nothing.

535
00:41:32,304 --> 00:41:36,088
- Never mind. Have you been good?
- What a question.

536
00:41:36,308 --> 00:41:39,677
- Fooling around with native girls?
- How could you think it?

537
00:41:39,895 --> 00:41:43,015
When you're away,
I think of all sorts of things.

538
00:41:43,232 --> 00:41:45,308
You see, all I think of is you.

539
00:41:45,526 --> 00:41:47,150
No kidding?

540
00:41:48,195 --> 00:41:52,193
Every moment - in the cabin,
on the bridge, even on the poop deck.

541
00:41:52,408 --> 00:41:57,034
You're always in my mind -
wondering what you do, whom you see.

542
00:41:57,246 --> 00:41:58,870
Oh, pigeon.

543
00:41:59,081 --> 00:42:02,913
Then alone at night,
under a canopy of tropical stars,

544
00:42:03,127 --> 00:42:06,911
with the soft strains
of a Viennese waltz from the salon...

545
00:42:07,131 --> 00:42:10,666
- Music, on a cargo ship?
- Oh, yes, we have a radio.

546
00:42:11,677 --> 00:42:13,337
Oh, yes.

547
00:42:15,806 --> 00:42:18,013
Now you've interrupted my thought.

548
00:42:18,225 --> 00:42:20,847
- You were thinking of me, pigeon.
- Yes, you.

549
00:42:21,061 --> 00:42:24,680
I would think of these adorable arms,
these little hands.

550
00:42:24,899 --> 00:42:29,561
and this delightful little wisp -
let me kiss you there.

551
00:42:33,073 --> 00:42:35,066
I wish you didn't have to go back.

552
00:42:35,284 --> 00:42:37,822
I'd much prefer to stay
and look after you.

553
00:42:38,037 --> 00:42:39,780
- Why don't you?
- You know.

554
00:42:39,997 --> 00:42:42,618
I can't stay home and do nothing.

555
00:42:42,833 --> 00:42:45,787
It'd be different
if I could manage your business.

556
00:42:46,003 --> 00:42:49,123
Uh-uh. I can manage
my own business affairs.

557
00:42:51,467 --> 00:42:52,842
You don't trust me.

558
00:42:53,052 --> 00:42:56,421
- I do trust you but -
- You don't! You don't.

559
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:59,556
That hurts.
That's what mars our happiness.

560
00:42:59,767 --> 00:43:03,302
You trust everyone but me.
Strangers can sell you anything.

561
00:43:03,521 --> 00:43:05,809
Any proposition and you'll bite.

562
00:43:06,023 --> 00:43:08,181
But, what do you know about business?

563
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,938
Emphatically more than you do,
my dear.

564
00:43:11,153 --> 00:43:14,522
Last time, you told me
all the banks were going broke,

565
00:43:14,782 --> 00:43:17,949
getting me all horsed up
about bringing my money home.

566
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:22,822
- Well, it's a good thing I didn't.
- Very well, we'll forget the matter.

567
00:43:25,376 --> 00:43:28,127
- Don't be mad, pigeon.
- I'm not angry, my dear.

568
00:43:28,337 --> 00:43:32,584
I'm saving you from squandering
your money on these enterprises.

569
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,125
- Worthless stocks.
- They're not.

570
00:43:35,344 --> 00:43:36,459
All of them.

571
00:43:38,597 --> 00:43:42,547
Well, I still have faith
in the Pacific Ocean Power Company.

572
00:43:42,768 --> 00:43:45,437
- What's that?
- I've told you about it.

573
00:43:45,646 --> 00:43:50,641
It's a machine that floats on waves.
Wheels that make electricity.

574
00:43:52,194 --> 00:43:54,103
What does it make when it's calm?

575
00:43:54,321 --> 00:43:56,231
Don't be a pessimist.

576
00:43:56,448 --> 00:44:00,149
That's what I mean. Wasting
your money on sheer nonsense.

577
00:44:00,369 --> 00:44:03,240
Inflation.
Very soon money will be worthless.

578
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:06,077
- What have you done?
- What do you want to do?

579
00:44:06,292 --> 00:44:09,246
Invest wisely, safely at least.

580
00:44:09,462 --> 00:44:13,127
Land, houses or jewelry. I knew
a friend who has some antique -

581
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:15,000
- That's funny.
- What?

582
00:44:15,217 --> 00:44:16,795
- Just what I did.
- What?

583
00:44:17,011 --> 00:44:20,012
- I bought jewelry, diamonds.
- Where?

584
00:44:20,222 --> 00:44:24,635
Don't get excited. From Joe, Vicki's
husband. The people who just left.

585
00:44:24,852 --> 00:44:28,137
My dear, that's not the way
to buy jewelry.

586
00:44:28,355 --> 00:44:30,977
He's a fence. He deals in hot stuff.

587
00:44:31,192 --> 00:44:35,439
I got a bargain, diamonds that big.
180 karats worth for 20,000 francs.

588
00:44:35,654 --> 00:44:39,604
- You couldn't buy glass for that.
- I did and not glass either.

589
00:44:39,825 --> 00:44:42,114
- How do you know?
- Are you crazy?

590
00:44:42,328 --> 00:44:45,531
- Let me see.
- If they double-crossed me, I'll -

591
00:44:45,748 --> 00:44:48,868
I'll tell you whether
you're double-crossed or not.

592
00:44:51,170 --> 00:44:53,459
Just as I thought, phony, fake.

593
00:44:53,672 --> 00:44:56,590
- What?
- Glass you silly ass, glass.

594
00:45:06,727 --> 00:45:10,262
- I must catch that 8: 15.
- You just got here an hour ago.

595
00:45:10,481 --> 00:45:14,229
I'm the captain. I can't stay away
while it's in repairs.

596
00:45:14,443 --> 00:45:16,317
- Repairs?
- It's up in dry dock.

597
00:45:16,529 --> 00:45:18,687
I'm here alone without a servant.

598
00:45:18,906 --> 00:45:21,611
- I can't help that.
- Why did you come home?

599
00:45:21,826 --> 00:45:26,238
To save you from crooks, swindlers,
people who are trying to rob you!

600
00:45:26,455 --> 00:45:28,033
I'll put them in jail.

601
00:45:28,249 --> 00:45:31,618
No, you won't. You thought
you were buying stolen goods.

602
00:45:31,836 --> 00:45:34,920
That's what you get
for being dishonest.

603
00:45:35,131 --> 00:45:39,045
200,000 francs you've spent.
And what have you to show for it?

604
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:42,510
Nothing, not a thing of value
but this house.

605
00:45:42,721 --> 00:45:45,675
They'll take this,
with the legal complications.

606
00:45:45,891 --> 00:45:47,635
- They won't.
- They will.

607
00:45:47,852 --> 00:45:49,844
They won't. I put it in your name.

608
00:45:53,149 --> 00:45:55,271
The first sensible thing you've done.

609
00:45:55,484 --> 00:45:57,940
They tried to attach my account.

610
00:45:58,154 --> 00:46:01,653
- Attach your what?
- Don't worry, they didn't get it.

611
00:46:01,866 --> 00:46:04,535
I took my money out
and I have it hidden away.

612
00:46:06,328 --> 00:46:07,360
Here in the house?

613
00:46:07,705 --> 00:46:08,736
Why...

614
00:46:10,124 --> 00:46:13,789
It doesn't matter where.
Nobody will find it. Not even you.

615
00:46:14,044 --> 00:46:16,452
There you go,
you're always suspicious.

616
00:46:16,672 --> 00:46:20,207
I'm not. It's just my defensive
mechanism, as you call it.

617
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:27,465
I hate to leave you alone
in this house tonight.

618
00:46:28,767 --> 00:46:31,305
- Stay.
- I could leave early in the morning.

619
00:46:33,230 --> 00:46:36,350
Why don't you?
We could go places and do things.

620
00:46:36,567 --> 00:46:40,399
Captain or not,
I'm not leaving you alone tonight.

621
00:46:40,613 --> 00:46:42,023
Pigeon.

622
00:47:25,032 --> 00:47:27,190
Two ounces of chloroform, please.

623
00:47:31,121 --> 00:47:33,410
- How much?
- 75 centimes.

624
00:47:51,725 --> 00:47:54,299
M. Challain.
My husband, Captain Bonheur.

625
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:57,521
I am president of
the Salt Water Fuel Company.

626
00:47:57,731 --> 00:47:59,771
- What?
- Here's 5,000 francs.

627
00:47:59,984 --> 00:48:01,941
- I'll send the rest.
- Thank you.

628
00:48:02,153 --> 00:48:04,857
- What is this?
- This is a personal matter.

629
00:48:05,072 --> 00:48:06,780
It might interest you.

630
00:48:06,991 --> 00:48:09,826
A device for turning salt water
into gasoline.

631
00:48:10,035 --> 00:48:12,158
- Give me that money!
- How dare you!

632
00:48:13,956 --> 00:48:15,367
Don't you do that.

633
00:48:17,251 --> 00:48:20,169
Don't you ever dare humiliate
me again in public.

634
00:48:21,506 --> 00:48:24,376
I tried to stop you
making a fool of yourself.

635
00:48:24,592 --> 00:48:27,712
I'm not so dumb. I won a lottery.

636
00:48:27,929 --> 00:48:31,843
Of all the effable nonsense,
turning seawater into gasoline.

637
00:48:32,058 --> 00:48:35,344
If it's a success,
we'll own the ocean, that's all.

638
00:48:35,561 --> 00:48:36,842
Preposterous.

639
00:48:37,063 --> 00:48:39,934
Oh, go to bed.
I want to get some sleep.

640
00:48:42,318 --> 00:48:43,943
Very well, my dear.

641
00:49:30,575 --> 00:49:32,449
- Who are you?
- I'm the maid.

642
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:35,614
- What do you want?
- I hoped to sleep here tonight.

643
00:49:35,830 --> 00:49:38,499
- You were discharged.
- I've nowhere to go.

644
00:49:38,708 --> 00:49:40,831
- Who is it?
- It's the maid.

645
00:49:41,044 --> 00:49:43,665
- What does she want?
- She wants to stay.

646
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:46,549
I promise you,
I'll leave in the morning.

647
00:49:46,758 --> 00:49:48,715
Oh, alright, let her stay.

648
00:49:48,926 --> 00:49:50,718
Merci, Madame.

649
00:50:09,072 --> 00:50:11,693
I don't know what happened
to that bedroom.

650
00:50:11,908 --> 00:50:14,992
It looks like a cyclone hit it.
Was I mad at you?

651
00:50:15,203 --> 00:50:16,994
No.

652
00:50:17,205 --> 00:50:20,206
- Coffee?
- No, thank you.

653
00:50:20,416 --> 00:50:23,203
- I thought you've fired her.
- Changed my mind.

654
00:50:23,419 --> 00:50:26,041
- Why?
- That's me. I haven't the heart.

655
00:50:26,255 --> 00:50:29,091
I can never find anyone else
to work as cheap.

656
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:31,756
- I must get back.
- I won't see you

657
00:50:31,970 --> 00:50:35,469
- for six weeks?
- I'll return before she sails.

658
00:50:35,682 --> 00:50:37,176
Goodbye, my dear.

659
00:50:53,783 --> 00:50:56,986
Mme Grosnay. Mme Grosnay.

660
00:50:58,287 --> 00:50:59,450
G.

661
00:51:06,838 --> 00:51:08,795
Ah. Gro... Gro... Gro...

662
00:51:09,007 --> 00:51:11,046
Ah, here we are, Mme Grosnay.

663
00:51:11,259 --> 00:51:14,129
Passy 3211.

664
00:51:16,264 --> 00:51:18,885
Hello, Passy 3211, please.

665
00:51:20,393 --> 00:51:22,931
Hello, has Mme Grosnay
returned to town?

666
00:51:23,146 --> 00:51:26,396
Oh, she has?
This is Benedict, the dressmaker.

667
00:51:28,234 --> 00:51:30,108
Oh, she's out now?

668
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:32,396
When will she return?

669
00:51:32,613 --> 00:51:35,698
12:30? Thank you.
No, there's no message.

670
00:51:37,910 --> 00:51:41,196
Mme Grosnay.
151 Avenue Victor Hugo.

671
00:51:41,414 --> 00:51:42,992
Ah, 151... 151...

672
00:52:16,491 --> 00:52:19,610
Mme Grosnay. Captain Bonheur.

673
00:52:19,827 --> 00:52:20,990
Who?

674
00:52:21,204 --> 00:52:24,454
I said I had the honor of meeting
you in the south of France.

675
00:52:24,666 --> 00:52:27,750
I'm M. Varnay.
You came to look over my house.

676
00:52:27,961 --> 00:52:29,834
- Oh, yes, I remember.
- Ah, yes.

677
00:52:30,046 --> 00:52:33,960
I wanted to send an astrology book
but couldn't find your address.

678
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:36,844
- Quite so.
- Quite so. Quite so.

679
00:52:37,053 --> 00:52:39,425
I realize I embarrassed you then,

680
00:52:39,639 --> 00:52:42,212
but if you'll only allow me
to explain.

681
00:52:42,433 --> 00:52:46,894
I don't think that incident requires
any further explanation.

682
00:52:47,105 --> 00:52:49,346
Good day, M. Varnay.

683
00:52:58,950 --> 00:53:00,824
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

684
00:53:01,035 --> 00:53:04,903
I want to order three dozen roses,
half a dozen orchids,

685
00:53:05,123 --> 00:53:08,456
and send them to Mme Grosnay,
151 Avenue Victor Hugo.

686
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:11,168
Merci, Monsieur.

687
00:53:11,754 --> 00:53:14,708
- A card?
- Yes. Five or six.

688
00:53:14,924 --> 00:53:17,415
Oui, Monsieur. As many as you wish.

689
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:21,721
I want to repeat it
twice a week for two weeks.

690
00:53:21,931 --> 00:53:23,473
Oui, Monsieur.

691
00:53:23,725 --> 00:53:26,512
- How much will that be?
- Let me see.

692
00:53:26,728 --> 00:53:30,061
That'll be five orders altogether.

693
00:53:30,273 --> 00:53:32,312
2,500 francs, Monsieur.

694
00:53:32,525 --> 00:53:34,103
Oh, la, la.

695
00:53:35,611 --> 00:53:38,482
Very well.
These things have to be done.

696
00:53:40,950 --> 00:53:43,821
- Keep the change.
- Merci, Monsieur.

697
00:53:55,089 --> 00:53:57,212
- Cordial, Martha?
- Yes, thanks.

698
00:53:57,425 --> 00:53:59,548
- Maurice?
- Oh, thank you, Mona.

699
00:53:59,761 --> 00:54:01,634
I hope we'll be seeing you more.

700
00:54:01,846 --> 00:54:04,337
He must be on the go every minute.

701
00:54:04,557 --> 00:54:06,265
One gets caught up

702
00:54:06,476 --> 00:54:09,726
in this monoxide world
of confusion.

703
00:54:09,937 --> 00:54:13,271
I look forward to
these quiet evenings together,

704
00:54:13,483 --> 00:54:17,148
with your edifying talks
on theurgic matters,

705
00:54:17,362 --> 00:54:19,687
the legerdemain of the apothecary.

706
00:54:19,906 --> 00:54:22,064
You should have been a chemist.

707
00:54:22,283 --> 00:54:27,029
Chemistry, my fellow, is the material
manifestation of the metaphysical.

708
00:54:27,246 --> 00:54:28,824
Ah, you're a mystic.

709
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:33,749
Do you remember discussing a humane
method of killing dumb animals?

710
00:54:33,962 --> 00:54:37,377
- Very distinctly.
- A lethal veterinary formula.

711
00:54:37,590 --> 00:54:40,959
No pain, no convulsions,
absolutely tasteless.

712
00:54:41,177 --> 00:54:43,502
The creature drinks it
and in an hour,

713
00:54:43,721 --> 00:54:46,391
curls up into a comfortable sleep
and dies.

714
00:54:46,599 --> 00:54:48,473
What a memory you have.

715
00:54:48,810 --> 00:54:52,759
You were experimenting
with three elements as I remember.

716
00:54:52,981 --> 00:54:55,436
Exnide, ethna bromide
and something else.

717
00:54:56,234 --> 00:54:59,733
Yes, it was very interesting,
pharmaceutically.

718
00:54:59,946 --> 00:55:03,279
The ethna bromide induces asphyxia,

719
00:55:03,491 --> 00:55:06,825
but in order to delay
the erodent action of the exnide,

720
00:55:07,036 --> 00:55:08,780
C2HC was added.

721
00:55:08,997 --> 00:55:10,657
C2HC?

722
00:55:10,873 --> 00:55:12,949
A freezing agent.

723
00:55:13,167 --> 00:55:16,750
When swallowed,
tissue changes are gradual.

724
00:55:16,963 --> 00:55:19,964
In an hour, the action
of the exnide takes place.

725
00:55:20,174 --> 00:55:22,214
Its effect is like heart disease -

726
00:55:22,427 --> 00:55:24,752
a systolic cramp and poof!

727
00:55:24,971 --> 00:55:27,676
- What have you done about it?
- Nothing.

728
00:55:27,890 --> 00:55:29,848
It's banned.

729
00:55:30,059 --> 00:55:33,677
- Why?
- Too dangerous for public use.

730
00:55:33,896 --> 00:55:37,894
In the post-mortem, not a trace
of the poison can be found.

731
00:55:38,109 --> 00:55:43,316
Can you imagine such a weapon
in the hands of an arch criminal?

732
00:55:43,531 --> 00:55:46,651
Think of the money
from the insurance companies.

733
00:55:46,868 --> 00:55:50,948
Quite an idea. We'll incorporate
and go into business.

734
00:55:51,372 --> 00:55:55,584
Insure people and have them die of
heart failure - we'd make millions.

735
00:55:55,793 --> 00:56:00,539
I'm not sure but I think the poison
might show up in a man.

736
00:56:00,757 --> 00:56:03,592
- Why?
- Different metabolism.

737
00:56:03,801 --> 00:56:05,082
We could find out.

738
00:56:05,303 --> 00:56:06,583
- How?
- Simple.

739
00:56:06,804 --> 00:56:09,509
You say it takes an hour
for the poison to work?

740
00:56:09,724 --> 00:56:13,472
Pick a derelict, poison him
then send him to a hotel.

741
00:56:13,686 --> 00:56:16,391
When a person is found dead
in a public place,

742
00:56:16,606 --> 00:56:19,476
there's an autopsy.
You'd know the result

743
00:56:19,692 --> 00:56:22,563
without taking the slightest risk.

744
00:56:22,779 --> 00:56:24,403
What a diabolical thought.

745
00:56:24,614 --> 00:56:29,276
However, such experiments, we had
better leave to the arch criminal,

746
00:56:29,494 --> 00:56:31,285
don't you think?

747
00:56:41,506 --> 00:56:43,545
C2HC.

748
00:57:31,890 --> 00:57:34,179
And now for the experiment.

749
00:58:00,878 --> 00:58:03,547
- Quite a shower.
- Yes, it is.

750
00:58:03,756 --> 00:58:06,922
- Can I escort you anywhere?
- Oh, thank you.

751
00:58:09,678 --> 00:58:11,587
Allow me.

752
00:58:21,190 --> 00:58:23,941
- You're from Belgium?
- I came after the war.

753
00:58:24,151 --> 00:58:25,894
A refugee?

754
00:58:26,111 --> 00:58:29,278
- Where do you live?
- Hotel Lausanne, off Montmartre.

755
00:58:29,490 --> 00:58:31,399
- Just a few doors away.
- Yes.

756
00:58:31,617 --> 00:58:34,452
Good. Why don't you take off
your coat?

757
00:58:34,662 --> 00:58:36,488
Allow me.

758
00:58:38,749 --> 00:58:40,991
- What's that?
- A kitten, poor thing.

759
00:58:41,210 --> 00:58:43,915
- I picked it up in the doorway.
- You like cats?

760
00:58:44,129 --> 00:58:47,249
Not particularly,
but it was all wet and cold.

761
00:58:47,466 --> 00:58:49,423
I don't suppose you have any milk.

762
00:58:49,635 --> 00:58:54,380
On the contrary, I do. The prospects
are not as gloomy as you think.

763
00:58:54,598 --> 00:58:58,975
- Do I sound that pessimistic?
- You do but I don't think you are.

764
00:58:59,186 --> 00:59:01,938
- Why?
- To be out on a night like this.

765
00:59:02,147 --> 00:59:03,855
You're an optimist.

766
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:09,064
- An optimist, I'm anything but that.
- Up against it, eh?

767
00:59:10,781 --> 00:59:13,070
Remarkable faculties of observation.

768
00:59:13,409 --> 00:59:14,819
Indeed.

769
00:59:16,412 --> 00:59:19,116
How long have you been
in this predicament?

770
00:59:20,207 --> 00:59:22,994
- Oh, quite a long time.
- How long?

771
00:59:23,210 --> 00:59:24,669
Three months.

772
00:59:24,878 --> 00:59:27,085
- I don't believe you.
- Why?

773
00:59:27,298 --> 00:59:29,919
You would have done better.

774
00:59:30,134 --> 00:59:31,711
Thanks.

775
00:59:31,927 --> 00:59:33,836
Now tell me the truth.

776
00:59:36,056 --> 00:59:39,472
You're just out of a hospital
or a jail. Which is it?

777
00:59:39,685 --> 00:59:42,390
- What do you want to know for?
- I want to help.

778
00:59:42,604 --> 00:59:45,605
- A philanthropist, eh?
- Precisely.

779
00:59:45,816 --> 00:59:49,648
- I ask nothing in return.
- What is this, the Salvation Army?

780
00:59:51,363 --> 00:59:55,147
If that's the way you feel,
you're at liberty to go your way.

781
01:00:02,541 --> 01:00:04,747
If you must know,
I'm just out of jail.

782
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:07,997
- What were you in for?
- What's the difference?

783
01:00:08,213 --> 01:00:10,420
- Larceny, they called it.
- Larceny?

784
01:00:10,633 --> 01:00:13,302
Pawning a rented typewriter.

785
01:00:13,510 --> 01:00:15,586
Couldn't you do better than that?

786
01:00:18,641 --> 01:00:20,680
- What did you get?
- Three months.

787
01:00:21,852 --> 01:00:23,892
This is your first day out of jail?

788
01:00:24,104 --> 01:00:26,014
Yes.

789
01:00:26,231 --> 01:00:28,023
I see.

790
01:00:28,692 --> 01:00:31,100
Poor dear. Oh, well.

791
01:00:32,363 --> 01:00:35,897
Nothing is permanent in this world,
not even our troubles.

792
01:00:36,116 --> 01:00:38,156
- Are you hungry?
- Frankly, yes.

793
01:00:38,369 --> 01:00:41,369
Then while I tend to
the culinary operations,

794
01:00:41,580 --> 01:00:44,201
you can help to bring in
a few things.

795
01:00:44,416 --> 01:00:46,124
Come.

796
01:00:47,169 --> 01:00:51,036
- Can I adopt your little kitten?
- Please do.

797
01:00:51,256 --> 01:00:53,830
We'll set the table for one.

798
01:00:54,051 --> 01:00:55,794
- Aren't you having any?
- No.

799
01:00:56,011 --> 01:00:58,965
Oh, then all we need
is a knife, fork and napkin.

800
01:00:59,181 --> 01:01:00,592
Here they are.

801
01:01:00,808 --> 01:01:02,717
Well, you will take them in there,

802
01:01:02,935 --> 01:01:05,177
make yourself at home.

803
01:01:05,396 --> 01:01:07,435
- Merci.
- Merci.

804
01:01:37,386 --> 01:01:41,882
I don't know whether this will
appeal. Eggs, toast and red wine.

805
01:01:42,099 --> 01:01:43,842
- Wonderful!
- Be seated.

806
01:01:44,059 --> 01:01:45,886
Thank you.

807
01:01:51,692 --> 01:01:56,769
You're tired. So right after supper,
I shall take you to your hotel.

808
01:01:56,989 --> 01:02:00,689
You're kind. I don't understand
why you're doing all this.

809
01:02:00,909 --> 01:02:03,946
Why not? Is a little kindness
such a rare thing?

810
01:02:04,163 --> 01:02:05,990
I was beginning to think it was.

811
01:02:06,206 --> 01:02:09,291
- The toast! Pardon me.
- Can I help you?

812
01:02:09,501 --> 01:02:12,039
No, no, stay where you are.
I can manage.

813
01:02:20,304 --> 01:02:22,095
- Voilà.
- You're funny.

814
01:02:22,306 --> 01:02:24,548
- Am I? Why?
- I don't know.

815
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:27,851
However, you're hungry.
Please go ahead.

816
01:03:12,523 --> 01:03:14,811
- What book is that?
- Schopenhauer.

817
01:03:15,025 --> 01:03:17,065
- Do you like him?
- So, so.

818
01:03:17,277 --> 01:03:19,400
Have you read his treatise
on suicide?

819
01:03:19,613 --> 01:03:22,697
- Wouldn't interest me.
- Not if the end was simple?

820
01:03:22,908 --> 01:03:24,568
Say you went to sleep,

821
01:03:24,785 --> 01:03:27,620
and there was a sudden stoppage.

822
01:03:27,830 --> 01:03:31,033
Wouldn't you prefer it
to this drab existence?

823
01:03:31,250 --> 01:03:34,619
- I wonder.
- The approach of death terrifies.

824
01:03:34,837 --> 01:03:37,921
I suppose if the unborn
knew of the approach of life,

825
01:03:38,132 --> 01:03:40,171
they'd be just as terrified.

826
01:03:46,682 --> 01:03:50,015
- Yet life is wonderful.
- What's wonderful about it?

827
01:03:51,895 --> 01:03:56,392
Everything, a spring morning,
a summer's night, music, art, love -

828
01:03:56,608 --> 01:03:59,360
- Love?
- There is such a thing.

829
01:03:59,570 --> 01:04:02,143
- How do you know?
- I was in love once.

830
01:04:02,364 --> 01:04:06,611
- Physically attracted by someone?
- It was more than that.

831
01:04:07,536 --> 01:04:09,778
Women are capable of something more.

832
01:04:09,997 --> 01:04:11,456
You don't like women?

833
01:04:11,707 --> 01:04:14,624
On the contrary,
I love but don't admire them.

834
01:04:14,835 --> 01:04:16,329
Why?

835
01:04:16,545 --> 01:04:21,041
Women are of the earth, realistic,
dominated by physical facts.

836
01:04:21,258 --> 01:04:22,456
What nonsense.

837
01:04:22,676 --> 01:04:25,298
Once a woman betrays a man,
she despises him.

838
01:04:25,512 --> 01:04:29,344
In spite of his goodness, she will
give him up for someone inferior,

839
01:04:29,558 --> 01:04:33,093
if that someone is more,
shall we say, attractive.

840
01:04:33,729 --> 01:04:36,018
How little you know about women.

841
01:04:36,774 --> 01:04:38,565
You'd be surprised.

842
01:04:39,818 --> 01:04:41,229
That isn't love.

843
01:04:41,445 --> 01:04:44,399
- What is love?
- Giving, sacrificing.

844
01:04:44,615 --> 01:04:46,773
What a mother feels for her child.

845
01:04:46,992 --> 01:04:49,364
- Did you love that way?
- Yes.

846
01:04:49,578 --> 01:04:52,034
- Whom?
- My husband.

847
01:04:53,957 --> 01:04:55,333
You're married?

848
01:04:56,502 --> 01:05:00,001
I was. He died while I was in jail.

849
01:05:01,340 --> 01:05:05,040
I see. Tell me about him.

850
01:05:06,387 --> 01:05:08,344
That's a long story.

851
01:05:08,555 --> 01:05:10,762
He was wounded in the war,
an invalid.

852
01:05:10,975 --> 01:05:12,718
An invalid?

853
01:05:12,935 --> 01:05:17,182
That's why I loved him.
He needed me, depended on me.

854
01:05:17,398 --> 01:05:19,889
He was like a child.

855
01:05:20,109 --> 01:05:22,066
But he was more than a child to me.

856
01:05:22,277 --> 01:05:25,812
He was a religion. My very breath.

857
01:05:26,281 --> 01:05:28,488
I'd have killed for him.

858
01:05:29,827 --> 01:05:33,955
No, love is something
very real and deep.

859
01:05:34,164 --> 01:05:35,824
I know that.

860
01:05:36,834 --> 01:05:38,791
- However.
- Pardon me.

861
01:05:39,003 --> 01:05:41,838
I believe there's a little cork
in that wine.

862
01:05:42,047 --> 01:05:44,336
Let me get you another glass.

863
01:06:27,676 --> 01:06:29,716
A penny for your thoughts.

864
01:06:30,638 --> 01:06:32,215
Oh, no.

865
01:06:35,267 --> 01:06:37,723
- More wine?
- Thank you, no more.

866
01:06:40,022 --> 01:06:43,058
Come, it's very late
and you're tired.

867
01:06:44,902 --> 01:06:46,645
Here.

868
01:06:50,616 --> 01:06:52,905
This will tide you over
for a day or so.

869
01:06:53,118 --> 01:06:55,158
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

870
01:06:56,163 --> 01:06:58,203
Oh, this is too much.

871
01:07:27,653 --> 01:07:29,942
Silly, carrying on this way.

872
01:07:30,155 --> 01:07:32,729
I was beginning to lose faith.

873
01:07:32,950 --> 01:07:36,366
Then this happens and you want
to believe all over again.

874
01:07:36,870 --> 01:07:41,947
This is a ruthless world and one
must be ruthless to cope with it.

875
01:07:43,043 --> 01:07:44,585
That isn't true.

876
01:07:44,795 --> 01:07:47,879
It's a blundering world
and a very sad one,

877
01:07:48,090 --> 01:07:50,248
yet kindness can make it beautiful.

878
01:07:51,510 --> 01:07:54,546
You'd better go before
your philosophy corrupts me.

879
01:08:03,564 --> 01:08:05,603
You can go out this way.

880
01:08:10,904 --> 01:08:12,944
Goodnight and thank you.

881
01:08:28,547 --> 01:08:31,465
- Good morning. Do I have a message?
- Not yet.

882
01:08:31,675 --> 01:08:34,166
How many orders
has Madame received?

883
01:08:34,386 --> 01:08:37,969
- Two. One every three days.
- Good. There's still a week to go?

884
01:08:38,182 --> 01:08:41,017
- Oui, Monsieur.
- I see. Oh, well.

885
01:08:41,226 --> 01:08:43,433
- We must hope for the best.
- Oui.

886
01:08:43,646 --> 01:08:46,101
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

887
01:10:15,279 --> 01:10:16,524
- M. Verdoux?
- Oui.

888
01:10:16,739 --> 01:10:19,693
I'm Detective Morrow
from Police Headquarters.

889
01:10:19,908 --> 01:10:22,744
- I'd like to talk to you.
- Won't you come in?

890
01:10:26,206 --> 01:10:29,077
- This way, please.
- Nice pieces you have here.

891
01:10:29,293 --> 01:10:32,045
- Quite a collector, eh?
- In a modest way.

892
01:10:34,506 --> 01:10:37,377
This is amusing.
An old galleon figurehead.

893
01:10:37,593 --> 01:10:40,510
- What's that?
- From the bow of a boat.

894
01:10:40,721 --> 01:10:43,473
Very nice. Pardon me.

895
01:10:47,102 --> 01:10:50,886
- What's that?
- I don't know where that came from.

896
01:10:56,862 --> 01:10:59,020
- Be seated, Monsieur.
- Merci.

897
01:11:03,577 --> 01:11:05,985
- A drink, Monsieur?
- No, no, merci.

898
01:11:06,205 --> 01:11:08,328
Then you'll pardon me?

899
01:11:19,051 --> 01:11:20,047
Well?

900
01:11:20,260 --> 01:11:23,676
- I want to ask you a few questions.
- Oui, Monsieur.

901
01:11:23,889 --> 01:11:29,892
- How long have you sold furniture?
- Approximately three years.

902
01:11:30,104 --> 01:11:34,101
- Do you know a Mme Thelma Varnay?
- I beg your pardon?

903
01:11:36,318 --> 01:11:38,394
Thelma Varnay.

904
01:11:39,822 --> 01:11:41,232
I do not, Monsieur.

905
01:11:41,448 --> 01:11:43,026
Or Lydia Floray?

906
01:11:43,242 --> 01:11:46,077
Floray. Floray?

907
01:11:46,286 --> 01:11:49,905
Oui, Monsieur. Lydia Floray
from the City of Corbell.

908
01:11:51,792 --> 01:11:53,535
I'm afraid I don't, Monsieur.

909
01:11:56,005 --> 01:11:57,665
- You're married?
- Yes.

910
01:11:57,881 --> 01:12:00,372
- You have a wife and child?
- Quite so.

911
01:12:00,592 --> 01:12:02,881
Your relationship with Mme Bonheur?

912
01:12:03,095 --> 01:12:05,586
Bonheur?
I don't understand, Monsieur.

913
01:12:06,265 --> 01:12:08,423
It's no use, Captain. The game's up.

914
01:12:08,642 --> 01:12:11,098
I've been shadowing you
for two weeks.

915
01:12:11,312 --> 01:12:15,179
You've been a pretty busy fellow,
traveling around the country.

916
01:12:15,399 --> 01:12:17,273
What you need is a pair of skates.

917
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:19,736
Does my wife know?

918
01:12:19,945 --> 01:12:23,990
No, Monsieur. No one knows anything,
not even Police Headquarters.

919
01:12:24,241 --> 01:12:28,784
- I wanted to make sure I was right.
- What are your charges?

920
01:12:36,629 --> 01:12:38,253
Bigamy.

921
01:12:51,602 --> 01:12:53,844
14 counts of murder.

922
01:12:54,688 --> 01:12:59,101
Congratulations, Monsieur. With the
murder charges, you won't succeed.

923
01:12:59,318 --> 01:13:00,516
We'll see.

924
01:13:00,736 --> 01:13:04,568
- There is <i>corpus delicti.</i>
- Don't worry, we'll find the bodies.

925
01:13:05,741 --> 01:13:07,734
I don't think you will, Monsieur.

926
01:13:07,951 --> 01:13:11,320
However, we'll hold you for bigamy
until we do. Let's go.

927
01:13:11,580 --> 01:13:15,874
Listen. You have no evidence
of murder and you know it.

928
01:13:16,085 --> 01:13:20,165
If you let me see my wife before
arrest, I'll sign a confession.

929
01:13:21,548 --> 01:13:23,375
That's a bargain.

930
01:13:33,686 --> 01:13:36,936
It'll be an hour and 20 minutes
before we get there.

931
01:13:38,273 --> 01:13:40,729
I never felt so tired.

932
01:13:40,943 --> 01:13:44,193
- Pardon me, if I take forty winks?
- As many as you like.

933
01:13:44,405 --> 01:13:48,023
I'm sorry. I must take every
precaution. Do you mind?

934
01:13:48,242 --> 01:13:50,151
Of course not.

935
01:13:54,456 --> 01:13:56,864
I never felt so sleepy.

936
01:13:57,084 --> 01:13:59,409
It must have been that wine.

937
01:15:21,961 --> 01:15:23,620
Hello.

938
01:15:24,254 --> 01:15:27,255
- How do you do?
- Don't you remember me?

939
01:15:27,883 --> 01:15:31,715
Ah, yes, yes.
How's the world treating you?

940
01:15:32,554 --> 01:15:34,630
I could complain, but I won't.

941
01:15:34,848 --> 01:15:38,597
I need a good manager.
Do you know anybody that wants a job?

942
01:15:38,811 --> 01:15:40,720
No, I don't.

943
01:15:40,938 --> 01:15:44,271
I can't keep on doing this sort
of business all the time.

944
01:15:44,483 --> 01:15:47,152
- I don't want any money.
- What do you want?

945
01:15:47,361 --> 01:15:50,445
Nothing, I just wanted to say hello,
that's all.

946
01:15:52,908 --> 01:15:54,402
You don't believe me?

947
01:15:55,577 --> 01:15:57,985
However, take this.

948
01:15:58,205 --> 01:16:01,574
- No, I don't want your money.
- Take it. Don't be a fool.

949
01:16:02,501 --> 01:16:03,876
Will I see you again?

950
01:16:06,714 --> 01:16:08,422
You go on about your business.

951
01:16:45,544 --> 01:16:46,825
That's my call.

952
01:16:52,384 --> 01:16:55,006
Hello? Annabella?
This is your pigeon.

953
01:16:55,220 --> 01:16:59,265
I'm flying home. I've been
at the shipping office all day.

954
01:16:59,475 --> 01:17:03,424
No, the boat's still up on the ways.
The damage was more serious.

955
01:17:03,646 --> 01:17:05,638
They're still scraping her sides.

956
01:17:06,649 --> 01:17:08,974
You would say something like that.

957
01:17:09,193 --> 01:17:12,229
We won't be ready for days,
so I'm coming home.

958
01:17:13,322 --> 01:17:14,946
Immediately.

959
01:17:15,908 --> 01:17:17,735
Goodbye, dear.

960
01:17:30,214 --> 01:17:33,380
- Good afternoon, Captain.
- Good afternoon.

961
01:17:33,592 --> 01:17:36,546
Will you take this up to my room?
Thank you.

962
01:17:36,762 --> 01:17:38,802
- Pigeon.
- Annabella.

963
01:17:40,432 --> 01:17:42,010
- What's that?
- Pretty?

964
01:17:42,226 --> 01:17:44,717
It's for the woman next door.

965
01:17:47,272 --> 01:17:51,899
I'm worried about the deed to this
house. I want it back in my name.

966
01:17:52,111 --> 01:17:55,195
- Why, of course.
- We can go to the lawyer's now.

967
01:17:55,406 --> 01:17:57,612
- Today?
- I want it done and over with.

968
01:17:57,825 --> 01:18:00,446
Oh, not now! I've only just arrived.

969
01:18:00,661 --> 01:18:03,448
Besides, I want this day to be ours.

970
01:18:03,664 --> 01:18:06,997
Just you and I,
alone in the waning twilight.

971
01:18:07,209 --> 01:18:09,332
If you talk like that,
I'll put it off.

972
01:18:09,545 --> 01:18:14,456
Good! We'll dine alone. We'll prepare
it ourselves and let the maid go.

973
01:18:14,675 --> 01:18:17,842
If I knew it was going to be
this kind of an evening.

974
01:18:18,053 --> 01:18:19,713
- Annette!
- Oui, Madame?

975
01:18:19,930 --> 01:18:23,346
- You may have the afternoon off.
- Merci, Madame.

976
01:18:31,775 --> 01:18:34,349
- Drink?
- Bordeaux'd be nice, pigeon.

977
01:18:34,570 --> 01:18:36,278
Bordeaux?

978
01:19:50,688 --> 01:19:51,802
What are you up to?

979
01:19:52,272 --> 01:19:54,312
- Oh, nothing, Madame.
- Did you break something?

980
01:19:54,525 --> 01:19:56,767
No, I was just closing the window.

981
01:19:57,569 --> 01:19:59,942
Do it more carefully next time.

982
01:20:01,657 --> 01:20:04,112
- Corkscrew.
- There's none here.

983
01:20:04,326 --> 01:20:06,817
It must be in the living room
somewhere.

984
01:21:38,337 --> 01:21:42,169
- Dinner'll be ready in a half hour.
- You deserve a little drink.

985
01:21:42,383 --> 01:21:45,882
I certainly do.
What are you drinking?

986
01:21:46,095 --> 01:21:48,253
- Sarsaparilla.
- Sarsaparilla?

987
01:21:48,472 --> 01:21:51,177
Doctor's orders, my dear.

988
01:21:51,392 --> 01:21:54,595
I can see how this evening will be.
Playing dominoes.

989
01:21:59,525 --> 01:22:03,273
It's good, nice and dry. I like it.
It makes me so thirsty.

990
01:22:18,669 --> 01:22:20,875
I've finished this whole bottle myself

991
01:22:21,088 --> 01:22:23,544
and you ain't touched yours yet.

992
01:22:23,757 --> 01:22:26,462
You've done nothing
but stare all evening.

993
01:22:26,677 --> 01:22:29,713
We were going to enjoy
the waning twilight.

994
01:22:29,930 --> 01:22:32,468
Be careful.
Be careful of the furniture.

995
01:22:32,683 --> 01:22:35,600
Oh, honey, you're always complaining.

996
01:22:35,811 --> 01:22:37,851
Here, drink your drink.

997
01:22:41,734 --> 01:22:44,569
I don't see how you can drink
that vile stuff.

998
01:22:44,778 --> 01:22:48,942
Very good, just like wine
and very dry too.

999
01:22:57,833 --> 01:22:59,873
You're drinking my wine!

1000
01:23:19,563 --> 01:23:22,481
Pigeon! Pigeon!

1001
01:23:27,112 --> 01:23:29,401
No! No!

1002
01:23:35,704 --> 01:23:37,946
Pigeon! Pigeon, let me in!

1003
01:23:41,502 --> 01:23:43,957
- Pigeon, darling!
- Milk!

1004
01:23:44,171 --> 01:23:47,421
- Qu'est-ce que c'est?
- Woman, leave me alone!

1005
01:23:47,633 --> 01:23:50,836
Let me help you, please, darling!
Annette!

1006
01:23:51,053 --> 01:23:53,626
Come down, quickly! Hurry!

1007
01:23:53,847 --> 01:23:56,338
What happened? Tell me, darling.

1008
01:23:57,434 --> 01:23:59,557
I'm poisoned! I'm dying.

1009
01:23:59,770 --> 01:24:02,771
- Telephone my wife.
- I'm here.

1010
01:24:02,982 --> 01:24:06,232
- Oh, dear! Here, take some wine.
- Take it away!

1011
01:24:06,443 --> 01:24:08,899
Poor darling, let me open your tie.

1012
01:24:09,113 --> 01:24:12,612
- Leave me alone.
- What's happened to that maid!

1013
01:24:16,620 --> 01:24:19,954
- Yes, Madame?
- What happened to you?

1014
01:24:20,165 --> 01:24:23,036
I don't know.
I was bleaching my hair,

1015
01:24:23,252 --> 01:24:25,375
- and it fell out.
- What's that?

1016
01:24:25,587 --> 01:24:29,206
- You'd better get two doctors!
- Take it away!

1017
01:24:29,425 --> 01:24:31,168
Calm, my love.

1018
01:24:31,811 --> 01:24:34,017
There's nothing to be worried about. If it's poison,

1019
01:24:34,230 --> 01:24:38,180
he'd certainly rid of it
after using the stomach pump.

1020
01:24:38,401 --> 01:24:41,984
Keep on taking the medicine
for two or three days.

1021
01:24:42,196 --> 01:24:44,106
How is the maid?

1022
01:24:44,324 --> 01:24:46,482
She feels OK but doesn't look good.

1023
01:24:46,701 --> 01:24:49,109
Strange you didn't have any effects.

1024
01:24:49,329 --> 01:24:51,736
Nothing affects me, I'm lucky.

1025
01:24:53,333 --> 01:24:56,536
A few days in the country
will do you both good.

1026
01:24:56,753 --> 01:24:58,829
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

1027
01:25:07,847 --> 01:25:10,599
He said we should go away
in the country

1028
01:25:10,808 --> 01:25:14,260
just you and I, alone.
Wouldn't that be fun?

1029
01:25:15,355 --> 01:25:17,394
Wonderful.

1030
01:25:38,295 --> 01:25:40,667
Oh, pigeon, not a soul anywhere.

1031
01:25:40,881 --> 01:25:42,505
Perfect.

1032
01:25:42,716 --> 01:25:45,966
- Why didn't we think of this before?
- Yes.

1033
01:25:47,596 --> 01:25:49,635
Oh, it's lovely.

1034
01:25:51,391 --> 01:25:55,436
- What's that?
- That's an anchor, for fishing.

1035
01:25:55,645 --> 01:25:58,101
We should catch scads of them here.

1036
01:25:59,232 --> 01:26:03,360
Oh, I see one, it's a monster!
Oh, no, it's me.

1037
01:26:04,154 --> 01:26:06,360
Isn't that silly? My own reflection.

1038
01:26:08,784 --> 01:26:11,820
I wished I could swim.
I'd love to go in.

1039
01:26:12,037 --> 01:26:14,658
- Would you?
- I'm just in the mood.

1040
01:26:14,873 --> 01:26:17,993
- We'll see what we can do.
- Will you teach me?

1041
01:26:18,210 --> 01:26:20,535
I'll do my best.

1042
01:26:23,006 --> 01:26:27,964
- There's a fish. Give me the rod.
- Now don't get excited, my dear.

1043
01:26:28,178 --> 01:26:31,132
If I had the rod,
I would have caught him.

1044
01:26:31,348 --> 01:26:33,590
- The hook must be baited.
- Bait it.

1045
01:26:33,809 --> 01:26:35,967
- Alright. Don't get...
- Shush! Shush!

1046
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:42,893
- Give me, quick! It's a big one.
- Just a minute.

1047
01:26:43,110 --> 01:26:46,894
The rod, quick! Come on!
Gimme the rod!

1048
01:26:47,114 --> 01:26:49,402
- You must wait.
- Don't be a fool!

1049
01:26:49,616 --> 01:26:51,905
By that time, the fish'll be gone.

1050
01:26:52,119 --> 01:26:54,158
Where's your common sense?

1051
01:26:56,915 --> 01:26:57,994
What's that?

1052
01:26:58,208 --> 01:27:03,878
You're not baiting him with that?
You don't expect them to eat this?

1053
01:27:08,677 --> 01:27:11,594
- What are you doing?
- Putting a worm on the hook.

1054
01:27:11,805 --> 01:27:14,094
- A worm?
- Of course!

1055
01:27:14,307 --> 01:27:19,219
Disgusting! You don't expect me
to eat fish that's been eating worms.

1056
01:27:19,438 --> 01:27:22,059
Very well. We'll fish without them.

1057
01:27:22,274 --> 01:27:23,898
Good.

1058
01:27:33,243 --> 01:27:36,078
- You're not angry, pigeon?
- Me? No.

1059
01:27:36,288 --> 01:27:39,704
Don't be mad because
you're wrong once in a while.

1060
01:27:39,916 --> 01:27:42,158
You can't be right all the time.

1061
01:27:44,921 --> 01:27:48,705
I can see scads of them.
They're smelling the hook.

1062
01:27:55,390 --> 01:27:58,261
- You know... Is something wrong?
- Hm?

1063
01:27:58,477 --> 01:28:02,142
They're wonderful.
There's millions of 'em down there.

1064
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:10,860
You know...
Be careful. You'll go overboard.

1065
01:28:11,072 --> 01:28:12,899
- Are you seasick?
- No.

1066
01:28:13,116 --> 01:28:17,161
Shame on you! A man who's lived
at sea all his life. Oh, Captain!

1067
01:28:17,370 --> 01:28:18,995
Shush!

1068
01:28:37,933 --> 01:28:40,388
I've got one. I've got one.

1069
01:28:40,602 --> 01:28:43,271
Ooh, I got... This is a whopper.

1070
01:28:43,480 --> 01:28:45,354
I've got... Pigeon, I've got one.

1071
01:28:45,565 --> 01:28:48,851
Hey, don't lie there asleep,
give me a hand!

1072
01:28:49,069 --> 01:28:52,354
What on earth's the matter with you?

1073
01:28:52,572 --> 01:28:56,191
It's gone. If you'd been on the job,
I would have caught him.

1074
01:28:57,452 --> 01:28:59,326
Are you drunk?

1075
01:29:00,539 --> 01:29:02,697
Oh, a solo drinker, huh?

1076
01:29:04,501 --> 01:29:07,336
Hmph, carrying a bottle!

1077
01:29:09,714 --> 01:29:12,751
They're still smelling the hook.
Big ones!

1078
01:29:14,719 --> 01:29:17,257
Just look at those fish.

1079
01:29:17,472 --> 01:29:19,844
There's a wise one.

1080
01:29:20,058 --> 01:29:24,435
No, he won't...
What are you going to do with that?

1081
01:29:24,646 --> 01:29:26,769
- Lasso him.
- Don't be silly!

1082
01:29:26,982 --> 01:29:29,224
You can't lasso a fish.

1083
01:29:29,443 --> 01:29:34,104
You can. All you have to do is
to place it over its head like that

1084
01:29:34,322 --> 01:29:36,481
and you pull it tight like this.

1085
01:29:40,203 --> 01:29:43,038
- What's that?
- A yodeller.

1086
01:29:44,166 --> 01:29:48,329
- Oh, that ruins everything.
- It certainly does.

1087
01:29:48,545 --> 01:29:50,668
Too bad we couldn't be by ourselves.

1088
01:29:50,881 --> 01:29:52,754
It certainly is.

1089
01:29:52,966 --> 01:29:56,631
- After all the plans we made.
- Yes.

1090
01:29:58,430 --> 01:30:01,597
He's looking at us through
field glasses.

1091
01:30:01,808 --> 01:30:05,592
We'd better take this off.
He'll think you're murdering me.

1092
01:30:07,814 --> 01:30:11,183
There's a whole gang.
They're going to have a picnic.

1093
01:30:11,401 --> 01:30:13,643
I give up, I'm going back to my boat.

1094
01:30:13,862 --> 01:30:16,435
- We've just arrived.
- I can't help that.

1095
01:30:16,656 --> 01:30:18,779
- Oh...
- What are you doing?

1096
01:30:18,992 --> 01:30:21,744
I got one... I've got a beaut...

1097
01:30:21,953 --> 01:30:24,658
Don't be a fool! Doesn't matter!

1098
01:30:24,873 --> 01:30:27,031
- Don't push.
- Who's pushing you?

1099
01:30:27,250 --> 01:30:29,243
- Don't be an idiot!
- Help!

1100
01:30:29,461 --> 01:30:31,335
- Sit down.
- I can't.

1101
01:30:31,546 --> 01:30:34,084
- Stand still.
- I'm trying.

1102
01:30:37,886 --> 01:30:41,587
Pigeon. Help! Help! Help!

1103
01:30:46,686 --> 01:30:50,933
You Idiot! Haven't you any more sense
than to stand up in a boat?

1104
01:30:51,149 --> 01:30:53,936
What's come over you,
you're acting strange.

1105
01:30:54,152 --> 01:30:56,192
Where's my hat?

1106
01:31:01,078 --> 01:31:05,740
- Mme Marie Grosnay?
- Oh, dear, dear, dear. Thanks.

1107
01:31:13,382 --> 01:31:16,134
I thought you were going
to the south of France.

1108
01:31:16,343 --> 01:31:18,881
I couldn't find anything
that suited me.

1109
01:31:19,096 --> 01:31:23,010
- More flowers, Madame.
- Put them over there.

1110
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:30,147
Oh, Marie. Mm, how wonderful.
Who sent them?

1111
01:31:30,357 --> 01:31:33,975
That awful man who keeps pursuing me.

1112
01:31:34,194 --> 01:31:38,488
How thrilling.
I'm dying to know what he's written.

1113
01:31:38,699 --> 01:31:42,993
Always the same thing.
Just two words, 'Please, please'.

1114
01:31:43,203 --> 01:31:45,410
I've never known such aggressiveness.

1115
01:31:45,622 --> 01:31:50,035
That's not aggressive. Whatever
he wants, at least he's asking for it.

1116
01:31:50,252 --> 01:31:53,621
- Why don't you call him?
- That old roué?

1117
01:31:53,839 --> 01:31:56,840
Well, as long as he's not too old.

1118
01:31:57,051 --> 01:32:01,547
I don't know the man. Besides,
I don't have his telephone number.

1119
01:32:01,764 --> 01:32:04,171
Send a letter care of the florist.

1120
01:32:08,729 --> 01:32:10,852
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

1121
01:32:11,065 --> 01:32:12,891
- A letter for you.
- Merci.

1122
01:32:13,108 --> 01:32:16,228
- Did you deliver the flowers?
- The last has gone.

1123
01:32:16,445 --> 01:32:18,603
Repeat it for another two weeks.

1124
01:32:18,822 --> 01:32:21,029
- Oui, Monsieur.
- Oh, wait.

1125
01:32:21,241 --> 01:32:24,112
You better cancel it.
May I use your telephone?

1126
01:32:24,328 --> 01:32:27,245
- Oui, Monsieur.
- Thank you.

1127
01:32:27,498 --> 01:32:30,748
Hello? Give me Passy 3211, please.

1128
01:32:32,586 --> 01:32:33,582
Hello?

1129
01:32:33,837 --> 01:32:35,213
This is M. Varnay.

1130
01:32:35,422 --> 01:32:39,171
I should be very angry with you,
but I have no more resistance.

1131
01:32:39,385 --> 01:32:43,169
- Good. When can I see you?
<i>- Why are you so persistent?</i>

1132
01:32:43,389 --> 01:32:46,555
- Simple because I love you.
<i>- You hardly know me.</i>

1133
01:32:46,767 --> 01:32:48,345
I've always known you.

1134
01:32:48,560 --> 01:32:52,475
When we met, I knew there was
a deep understanding between us.

1135
01:32:52,690 --> 01:32:54,931
It was in your eyes, Marie.

1136
01:32:55,150 --> 01:33:00,227
They are beautiful,
like the loneliness of distant stars.

1137
01:33:00,447 --> 01:33:04,659
- I wonder, who are you in the dark?
<i>- I don't quite understand.</i>

1138
01:33:04,868 --> 01:33:08,035
I can't express it,
only a symphony could say it.

1139
01:33:08,247 --> 01:33:09,622
The music of the spheres.

1140
01:33:09,873 --> 01:33:13,040
I'm not as ethereal as all that.

1141
01:33:13,252 --> 01:33:16,834
You are everything.
Saint, sinner, snake and gazelle.

1142
01:33:17,047 --> 01:33:21,259
I can't forget you. Every look, tone,
gesture is engraved in my mind.

1143
01:33:21,468 --> 01:33:25,632
I must see you, Marie.
Immediately. Now. Good.

1144
01:33:25,889 --> 01:33:27,882
I'll be right over. Mm-hm.

1145
01:33:32,813 --> 01:33:34,272
How much is that?

1146
01:33:35,733 --> 01:33:37,108
One franc, Monsieur.

1147
01:33:39,570 --> 01:33:41,609
Keep the change.

1148
01:33:53,625 --> 01:33:55,784
Marie. My own beloved.

1149
01:33:56,003 --> 01:33:59,751
I beg your pardon,
whom did you wish to see?

1150
01:33:59,965 --> 01:34:02,634
- Mme Grosnay.
- This way, please.

1151
01:34:07,514 --> 01:34:09,306
This way.

1152
01:34:12,644 --> 01:34:15,515
I am Mme Lasalle,
Marie will be down in a moment.

1153
01:34:18,192 --> 01:34:19,223
Of course.

1154
01:34:25,407 --> 01:34:27,447
How do you do?

1155
01:34:28,786 --> 01:34:33,246
- Yvonne, this is M. Varnay.
- Yes, we've just met.

1156
01:34:33,457 --> 01:34:36,126
I'll see you at my house
for dinner at 7:30.

1157
01:34:36,335 --> 01:34:39,538
- Yes, at 7:30.
- Oh, don't bother, darling.

1158
01:34:39,755 --> 01:34:42,044
Goodbye. Goodbye.

1159
01:34:47,054 --> 01:34:50,423
- Well, you wicked man.
- Wicked?

1160
01:34:50,641 --> 01:34:54,508
Yes, very wicked.

1161
01:34:54,728 --> 01:34:58,144
- Sit over there.
- Thank you.

1162
01:35:00,275 --> 01:35:02,434
- Tea?
- Thank you.

1163
01:35:04,321 --> 01:35:07,073
- Milk and sugar?
- No, thank you.

1164
01:35:08,534 --> 01:35:12,282
Now that Yvonne is gone,
I'm a little afraid of you.

1165
01:35:12,496 --> 01:35:14,619
Afraid? Why?

1166
01:35:14,832 --> 01:35:17,951
You know what happened
the last time we were alone.

1167
01:35:18,168 --> 01:35:21,751
I'm sorry. I allowed my emotions
to get the better of me.

1168
01:35:21,964 --> 01:35:25,914
- It will never occur again.
- Oh, don't say that.

1169
01:35:29,847 --> 01:35:31,886
That's one of the ironies of life,

1170
01:35:32,099 --> 01:35:34,720
doing the wrong thing
at the right moment.

1171
01:35:34,935 --> 01:35:38,138
Or shall we say, the right thing
at the wrong moment.

1172
01:35:38,355 --> 01:35:41,440
- Marie.
- Oh, don't...

1173
01:35:41,650 --> 01:35:43,809
I never spilled a drop.

1174
01:35:44,028 --> 01:35:45,854
Marie. Oh, my dear.

1175
01:35:46,071 --> 01:35:48,278
- Oh...
- No, please...

1176
01:35:53,871 --> 01:35:57,370
Whoever thought
this would happen to Marie.

1177
01:35:57,583 --> 01:35:59,456
- All so sudden, too.
- Yes, yes.

1178
01:35:59,668 --> 01:36:00,699
- John.
- Yes.

1179
01:36:00,919 --> 01:36:04,086
We must give them a drink.
The minister will be late.

1180
01:36:04,298 --> 01:36:05,922
He has a burial first.

1181
01:36:06,133 --> 01:36:08,838
He should marry them then bury them.

1182
01:36:09,053 --> 01:36:12,338
Marie's having trouble
with her trousseau.

1183
01:36:12,556 --> 01:36:14,430
- Bridegroom?
- Not here yet.

1184
01:36:14,641 --> 01:36:16,468
He hates this sort of thing.

1185
01:36:16,685 --> 01:36:20,434
They wanted a quiet affair,
but you know how these things grow.

1186
01:36:20,647 --> 01:36:21,976
Yes.

1187
01:36:24,610 --> 01:36:28,477
- What was that?
- I've never seen her before.

1188
01:36:28,697 --> 01:36:30,737
M. Bismo brought her along.

1189
01:36:32,868 --> 01:36:34,611
I'll tell that to the captain.

1190
01:36:34,828 --> 01:36:37,995
Have you heard the one
about the old couple...

1191
01:36:38,207 --> 01:36:39,452
Ah, good afternoon.

1192
01:36:39,666 --> 01:36:43,367
Ah, meet my old friend, M. Carno.
And what are you doing here?

1193
01:36:43,587 --> 01:36:46,588
Weddings, funerals,
I attend them all.

1194
01:36:46,799 --> 01:36:49,753
- As I was saying...
- Are you a bridesmaid?

1195
01:36:49,968 --> 01:36:53,384
- I'm just a stranger.
- Mme Bonheur is a friend of mine.

1196
01:36:53,597 --> 01:36:56,135
She was in Paris,
so I brought her along.

1197
01:37:00,521 --> 01:37:03,687
- Henri, dear. How are you?
- A little shaky.

1198
01:37:03,899 --> 01:37:07,517
I know you wanted a quiet wedding,
but I had to do this for Marie.

1199
01:37:07,736 --> 01:37:12,232
I'm sorry to put you through this
but now you must meet my friends.

1200
01:37:12,449 --> 01:37:15,699
This is the bridegroom,
M. Varnay

1201
01:37:15,911 --> 01:37:18,484
and this is Mme Cornet.

1202
01:37:18,706 --> 01:37:21,872
M. Simon. M. Delage.

1203
01:37:22,084 --> 01:37:24,657
Mme Bremer. Mme Voselli.

1204
01:37:24,878 --> 01:37:29,671
M. Contrepaire. M. Potis. Mme Voulon.

1205
01:37:29,883 --> 01:37:33,169
- And of course, my husband.
- Monsieur.

1206
01:37:33,387 --> 01:37:36,590
There. I'll introduce the rest
after the ceremony.

1207
01:37:36,807 --> 01:37:38,716
- Aren't I nice?
- You are kind.

1208
01:37:38,934 --> 01:37:41,769
No, no, I don't mean that
in a derogatory sense.

1209
01:37:43,022 --> 01:37:45,228
- Oh, I beg your pardon.
- Granted.

1210
01:37:45,441 --> 01:37:47,682
- A drink?
- I'd love one.

1211
01:37:47,901 --> 01:37:50,819
- Oh, Claire.
- M. Varnay, how do you feel?

1212
01:37:51,030 --> 01:37:52,572
Very abstract.

1213
01:37:52,781 --> 01:37:55,782
Pull yourself together.
The worst is yet to come.

1214
01:37:55,993 --> 01:37:59,860
That's true. What am I saying?
This is my day of faux pas.

1215
01:38:00,080 --> 01:38:04,125
- Oh, let's hope not, Monsieur.
- I didn't mean that, either.

1216
01:38:04,334 --> 01:38:06,374
I beg your pardon.

1217
01:38:15,971 --> 01:38:20,348
At funerals one's inclined to laugh
and at weddings, weep.

1218
01:38:25,314 --> 01:38:27,306
Evidently,
somebody disagrees with me.

1219
01:38:27,524 --> 01:38:30,561
- Who on earth can she be?
- Well, you should know.

1220
01:38:30,778 --> 01:38:33,529
Oh, yes, a Mme Bonheur.

1221
01:38:33,739 --> 01:38:35,778
I think she's from Lyons.

1222
01:38:39,453 --> 01:38:43,616
That's good luck. That means you're
going to be pleasantly surprised.

1223
01:38:44,875 --> 01:38:46,583
Pardon me.

1224
01:38:46,794 --> 01:38:49,748
- What's wrong?
- I think it's the cocktails.

1225
01:38:55,469 --> 01:38:57,296
I'll have a beer.

1226
01:38:59,223 --> 01:39:02,389
Thank you. Where's Bismo?

1227
01:39:02,601 --> 01:39:03,930
Excuse me.

1228
01:39:05,729 --> 01:39:09,347
M. Varnay.
Is there anything wrong?

1229
01:39:09,566 --> 01:39:12,057
No. I was just admiring your flowers.

1230
01:39:12,277 --> 01:39:16,061
Oh! Well, over on this side
we have our lovely bluebells.

1231
01:39:16,281 --> 01:39:20,659
- Ah, the <i>campanulas.</i>
- And over here are the primroses.

1232
01:39:20,869 --> 01:39:23,111
Of course, the <i>genus Oenothera.</i>

1233
01:39:24,832 --> 01:39:27,667
- Oh, what's wrong? Are you ill?
- Cramps.

1234
01:39:27,876 --> 01:39:29,916
They attack me ever since India.

1235
01:39:30,129 --> 01:39:32,417
Oh, well. Let me get you something.

1236
01:39:32,631 --> 01:39:35,418
- It'll pass soon.
- The minister's here.

1237
01:39:35,634 --> 01:39:39,502
- Tell him to wait. Can't I help?
- No, no. Please.

1238
01:39:39,722 --> 01:39:41,132
- Bismo.
- Hello.

1239
01:39:41,348 --> 01:39:43,341
- Mme Bonheur.
- Pleasure.

1240
01:39:43,559 --> 01:39:47,722
- Take good care of her.
- Well, you just leave that to me.

1241
01:39:47,938 --> 01:39:51,770
Oh, John. Oh, how do you do.

1242
01:39:51,984 --> 01:39:56,313
The minister's arrived and Henri's
taken with cramps. Look after him.

1243
01:39:56,530 --> 01:39:59,531
Well, let's see what we can do
for M. Varnay.

1244
01:40:05,289 --> 01:40:08,206
He isn't here.
He must have recovered.

1245
01:40:08,417 --> 01:40:11,371
Possibly you'll find him
at the punch bowl?

1246
01:40:11,587 --> 01:40:13,626
Come on, we'll go see.

1247
01:40:19,178 --> 01:40:21,799
- What are you lookin' for?
- Huh?

1248
01:40:22,014 --> 01:40:25,050
- Have you lost something?
- I dropped my sandwich.

1249
01:40:25,267 --> 01:40:28,885
- What kind was it?
- Just an ordinary sandwich.

1250
01:40:29,104 --> 01:40:31,476
A slice of bread between some meat.

1251
01:40:31,690 --> 01:40:35,190
- White or rye?
- Er, yes.

1252
01:40:35,402 --> 01:40:37,644
Stay here
and I'll get you another one.

1253
01:40:37,863 --> 01:40:39,654
Thank you.

1254
01:40:48,248 --> 01:40:50,537
- He isn't here.
- Oh, there he is.

1255
01:40:50,751 --> 01:40:52,790
Excuse me. Stay right here.

1256
01:40:58,592 --> 01:41:00,585
- What's the matter?
- Cramps.

1257
01:41:00,803 --> 01:41:02,842
The worst attack I've had in years.

1258
01:41:03,055 --> 01:41:06,305
- I'll take you into the house.
- I prefer to stay here.

1259
01:41:06,517 --> 01:41:09,387
Friends.
The great moment has arrived.

1260
01:41:09,603 --> 01:41:11,430
Please come into the house.

1261
01:41:13,482 --> 01:41:16,898
You can't go through a ceremony.
I'll take you inside.

1262
01:41:17,111 --> 01:41:20,480
I'd like to stay in the garden.
The air will do me good.

1263
01:41:20,698 --> 01:41:23,901
Ah, there you are.
I didn't quite understand.

1264
01:41:24,118 --> 01:41:27,818
Did you want white or rye?

1265
01:41:28,038 --> 01:41:29,449
Rye.

1266
01:41:32,327 --> 01:41:34,996
You certainly have
a beautiful place here.

1267
01:41:35,204 --> 01:41:37,114
- Wonderful.
- Thank you.

1268
01:41:37,332 --> 01:41:38,707
I'm comin'.

1269
01:41:38,917 --> 01:41:41,039
I'll have them delay the ceremony.

1270
01:41:41,252 --> 01:41:43,660
If you lie down
maybe the pain will go.

1271
01:41:43,880 --> 01:41:47,083
- You go and tell them.
- I'll get you into the house.

1272
01:41:47,300 --> 01:41:50,633
- I'm feeling better.
- I'm not going to take any chances.

1273
01:41:50,845 --> 01:41:52,505
Come along.

1274
01:41:57,810 --> 01:42:00,218
I wish you'd let me stay
in the fresh air.

1275
01:42:00,438 --> 01:42:02,846
No, no.
Ten minutes rest will do you good.

1276
01:42:07,487 --> 01:42:11,401
The thing is muscular.
It attacks the <i>serratus magnus.</i>

1277
01:42:15,203 --> 01:42:17,776
- What was that?
- Nothing at all. Go ahead.

1278
01:42:24,379 --> 01:42:25,374
Varnay.

1279
01:42:25,588 --> 01:42:28,625
- Henri.
- Beloved. See you later.

1280
01:42:29,968 --> 01:42:31,248
Varnay.

1281
01:42:32,387 --> 01:42:34,011
M. Varnay.

1282
01:42:37,934 --> 01:42:39,097
Varnay!

1283
01:42:46,150 --> 01:42:48,902
This M. Varnay seems to be
our man alright,

1284
01:42:49,112 --> 01:42:51,781
but he must have several aliases.

1285
01:42:51,990 --> 01:42:53,733
I can't believe it.

1286
01:42:53,950 --> 01:42:57,782
It's too bad he didn't jilt Thelma.
You're to be congratulated.

1287
01:42:57,996 --> 01:43:01,447
I knew it was the same man
the moment we read it in the papers.

1288
01:43:01,666 --> 01:43:04,335
We don't even have a photograph.

1289
01:43:04,544 --> 01:43:07,414
- But I'd know him if I ever saw him.
- So would I.

1290
01:43:07,630 --> 01:43:11,379
- What was his last address?
- The Hotel Splendide.

1291
01:43:11,593 --> 01:43:12,968
He moved.

1292
01:43:13,177 --> 01:43:16,131
I know. He seems to have
moved from everywhere.

1293
01:43:16,347 --> 01:43:18,387
What business was he in?

1294
01:43:18,600 --> 01:43:21,091
He said he was an explorer

1295
01:43:21,311 --> 01:43:24,265
working for the International
Geographical Society.

1296
01:43:24,480 --> 01:43:26,806
It would be a good idea
to call them up.

1297
01:43:27,025 --> 01:43:29,646
He's on his way to the North Pole
by now.

1298
01:43:29,861 --> 01:43:33,277
There is no such organization.

1299
01:43:33,489 --> 01:43:35,648
However, we must keep a lookout.

1300
01:43:35,867 --> 01:43:39,200
This is to be confidential.
Not a word to the press,

1301
01:43:39,412 --> 01:43:41,950
as it would jeopardize
our investigation.

1302
01:44:27,544 --> 01:44:31,411
Hello? Hello?
Yes, yes, yes. What?

1303
01:44:31,631 --> 01:44:33,291
I said, we have to foreclose.

1304
01:44:33,508 --> 01:44:35,547
You can't. My wife and child.

1305
01:44:35,760 --> 01:44:37,753
We need the money. We can't wait.

1306
01:44:37,971 --> 01:44:41,304
Listen, give me ten minutes.
Just ten minutes.

1307
01:44:42,642 --> 01:44:44,681
Good. I'll call you back.

1308
01:44:46,896 --> 01:44:48,438
Reaumur 6572.

1309
01:44:56,072 --> 01:44:58,065
Hello. Balong & Company.

1310
01:44:58,283 --> 01:45:01,782
This is Henri Verdoux.
Sell everything I have at once.

1311
01:45:01,995 --> 01:45:05,494
Are you mad?
You were wiped out hours ago.

1312
01:46:19,781 --> 01:46:21,654
Come here.

1313
01:46:21,866 --> 01:46:23,064
Yes, you.

1314
01:46:27,163 --> 01:46:30,247
- Hello, Mr Philanthropist.
- Philanthropist?

1315
01:46:30,458 --> 01:46:34,123
You took me to your apartment
one rainy night.

1316
01:46:34,337 --> 01:46:36,793
- Really?
- Yes. After feeding me

1317
01:46:37,006 --> 01:46:38,086
and giving me money,

1318
01:46:38,341 --> 01:46:41,258
you sent me on my way
like a good little girl.

1319
01:46:41,469 --> 01:46:43,260
- I must have been a fool.
- Hey.

1320
01:46:43,471 --> 01:46:46,757
- Oh, shut up. Where are you going?
- Nowhere.

1321
01:46:46,975 --> 01:46:48,967
- Get in.
- Thank you.

1322
01:47:00,363 --> 01:47:02,735
To the Café Royal.

1323
01:47:02,949 --> 01:47:05,072
Now I shall ask you to feed me again.

1324
01:47:05,285 --> 01:47:07,277
I'm afraid that will be difficult.

1325
01:47:07,495 --> 01:47:09,701
I'll have the pleasure
of feeding you.

1326
01:47:09,914 --> 01:47:11,195
Thank you.

1327
01:47:11,416 --> 01:47:13,325
I wanted to meet you again.

1328
01:47:13,543 --> 01:47:16,164
I even went to your store,
but you had moved.

1329
01:47:16,379 --> 01:47:18,751
I haven't lived there in ages.

1330
01:47:18,965 --> 01:47:22,963
I still think you don't remember me.
But why should you?

1331
01:47:23,177 --> 01:47:26,013
There is every apparent reason
why I should.

1332
01:47:26,222 --> 01:47:29,057
The night we met
I was just out of jail.

1333
01:47:29,267 --> 01:47:31,425
Shush, the chauffeur.

1334
01:47:34,480 --> 01:47:37,565
Of course. Your invalid husband.

1335
01:47:37,775 --> 01:47:42,105
- Oh, you remember that?
- Something I shall never forget.

1336
01:47:43,948 --> 01:47:46,486
But you, and all this. What happened?

1337
01:47:46,701 --> 01:47:49,370
The old story, from rags to riches.

1338
01:47:49,621 --> 01:47:52,990
My luck changed.
I met a munitions manufacturer.

1339
01:47:53,207 --> 01:47:56,244
That's the business
I should have been in.

1340
01:47:56,461 --> 01:47:59,296
Yes, it will be paying
big dividends soon.

1341
01:48:37,544 --> 01:48:42,004
It's nice seeing you. You'll never
realize what your kindness meant.

1342
01:48:42,215 --> 01:48:45,169
Kindness is a convenient thing
at times, my dear.

1343
01:48:45,385 --> 01:48:47,591
However, tell me about yourself.

1344
01:48:47,804 --> 01:48:50,377
I prefer to talk about
something pleasant.

1345
01:48:50,598 --> 01:48:53,054
- You for instance and this...
- And what?

1346
01:48:53,268 --> 01:48:55,391
What sort of a chap is your friend?

1347
01:48:55,603 --> 01:48:58,889
In many ways, very kind and generous.

1348
01:48:59,107 --> 01:49:03,816
- But in business, quite ruthless.
- Business is a ruthless business.

1349
01:49:04,028 --> 01:49:07,148
- Do you love him?
- I thought you didn't believe in it?

1350
01:49:07,365 --> 01:49:09,488
Everyone needs love.

1351
01:49:09,701 --> 01:49:13,864
Something's happened. You seem to
have lost your zest for bitterness.

1352
01:49:14,080 --> 01:49:17,947
Perhaps I have no more use for it
since I've given up the fight.

1353
01:49:18,167 --> 01:49:20,374
There's always something
to fight for.

1354
01:49:20,587 --> 01:49:24,002
- For me, there is nothing.
- Nothing?

1355
01:49:24,215 --> 01:49:27,086
Soon after the crash,
I lost my wife and child.

1356
01:49:27,302 --> 01:49:30,137
Oh, I'm sorry, I never realized.

1357
01:49:30,346 --> 01:49:34,095
However, they're much happier
where they are...

1358
01:49:34,309 --> 01:49:37,013
than living in this world
of uncertainty.

1359
01:49:37,228 --> 01:49:39,802
You have changed. I can see that.

1360
01:49:40,023 --> 01:49:42,774
Since the loss of my family,

1361
01:49:42,984 --> 01:49:45,475
I seem to have awakened from a dream.

1362
01:49:45,695 --> 01:49:50,690
- What do you mean?
- I was a bank clerk once.

1363
01:49:50,909 --> 01:49:53,945
My existence
a monotonous rhythm.

1364
01:49:54,162 --> 01:49:56,949
Day in and day out, counting money.

1365
01:49:57,165 --> 01:50:00,783
Then the rhythm was broken.
I lost my position.

1366
01:50:02,128 --> 01:50:05,082
What followed was a numbed confusion.

1367
01:50:05,298 --> 01:50:10,090
A nightmare in which
I lived in a half dream world.

1368
01:50:10,303 --> 01:50:14,965
A horrible world.
And now I've awakened.

1369
01:50:15,183 --> 01:50:17,852
I wonder if that world ever existed.

1370
01:50:20,980 --> 01:50:24,978
You went through a bad ordeal.
Don't allow it to take hold of you.

1371
01:50:25,193 --> 01:50:28,941
It hasn't. Despair is a narcotic.

1372
01:50:29,155 --> 01:50:31,231
It lulls the mind into indifference.

1373
01:50:31,532 --> 01:50:33,324
But that's giving up life.

1374
01:50:33,534 --> 01:50:36,286
We must all give it up
sooner or later.

1375
01:50:36,496 --> 01:50:39,580
- Yes, but not before our time.
- Why?

1376
01:50:39,791 --> 01:50:42,460
Must you know the reason
for everything?

1377
01:50:42,669 --> 01:50:45,586
It might help a little if we did.

1378
01:50:47,173 --> 01:50:51,005
Life is beyond reason.
That's why you must go on.

1379
01:50:51,219 --> 01:50:53,544
If it's only to fulfill your destiny.

1380
01:50:55,181 --> 01:50:56,510
My destiny!

1381
01:51:04,065 --> 01:51:08,727
Why would anyone want to go up
in the Eiffel Tower at night?

1382
01:51:08,945 --> 01:51:11,317
That was Phoebe's idea.
She has her way.

1383
01:51:11,531 --> 01:51:13,986
- How many?
- There'll be five.

1384
01:51:14,200 --> 01:51:15,611
This way, please.

1385
01:51:19,831 --> 01:51:23,164
- I'd like to eat now, I'm hungry.
- We'd better wait.

1386
01:51:23,376 --> 01:51:25,036
They'll be hours yet.

1387
01:51:25,253 --> 01:51:27,660
We can have a drink.
What do you want?

1388
01:51:27,881 --> 01:51:28,876
Vermouth.

1389
01:51:29,090 --> 01:51:30,418
- Two Vermouth.
- Oui.

1390
01:51:30,633 --> 01:51:32,092
Let's dance.

1391
01:51:50,445 --> 01:51:52,236
- What?
- Thelma's husband.

1392
01:51:52,447 --> 01:51:54,274
- Where?
- Behind you.

1393
01:51:57,827 --> 01:51:59,654
You're right. It is.

1394
01:52:00,455 --> 01:52:03,621
- You're stepping all over my feet.
- I can't help it.

1395
01:52:09,339 --> 01:52:11,746
Oh, Thelma. Poor Thelma.

1396
01:52:11,966 --> 01:52:14,967
Pull yourself together.
I'm phoning the police.

1397
01:52:15,178 --> 01:52:18,298
- Don't leave. He'll murder me.
- Keep your eye on him.

1398
01:52:18,514 --> 01:52:22,014
Don't let him out of your sight.
If he leaves, follow him.

1399
01:52:30,944 --> 01:52:34,110
You look tired.
You need someone to look after you.

1400
01:52:34,322 --> 01:52:37,738
- I must take you in hand.
- You're very kind.

1401
01:52:53,675 --> 01:52:55,335
Merci, Madame.

1402
01:53:29,419 --> 01:53:30,877
Thank you.

1403
01:53:39,513 --> 01:53:40,971
Cab, sir?

1404
01:53:42,766 --> 01:53:44,593
Car number ten.

1405
01:53:52,609 --> 01:53:56,108
- They're leaving.
- Take down the number of the car.

1406
01:53:56,321 --> 01:53:58,397
I haven't got a pencil. Go get one.

1407
01:54:02,327 --> 01:54:04,154
Pardon me.

1408
01:54:07,290 --> 01:54:10,909
- Do you have a pencil?
- Try the office around the corner.

1409
01:54:11,128 --> 01:54:12,503
- Thank you.

1410
01:54:21,596 --> 01:54:23,755
Open up. Open up this door.

1411
01:54:23,974 --> 01:54:26,097
- Let me out.
- Help, help.

1412
01:54:32,607 --> 01:54:35,858
- I shall say goodbye to you.
- What are you going to do?

1413
01:54:36,069 --> 01:54:38,441
I'm going to fulfill my destiny.

1414
01:54:38,655 --> 01:54:40,778
Here's my card.

1415
01:54:40,991 --> 01:54:43,114
Be sure to let me hear from you,
soon.

1416
01:54:43,326 --> 01:54:44,607
Merci.

1417
01:54:44,828 --> 01:54:46,702
- Tomorrow?
- Tomorrow.

1418
01:54:50,792 --> 01:54:52,334
Alright, sir.

1419
01:55:03,346 --> 01:55:06,632
Your positions. One on each corner
and two at the back.

1420
01:55:06,850 --> 01:55:08,593
The rest come with me.

1421
01:55:10,103 --> 01:55:12,511
- Victor, you remain here.
- Yes, sir.

1422
01:55:19,071 --> 01:55:22,440
Here. Break it up. Around this way.

1423
01:55:26,369 --> 01:55:29,988
- Come on. Let these men through.
- Help! Help!

1424
01:55:30,207 --> 01:55:32,330
Help! Help!

1425
01:55:34,378 --> 01:55:37,996
- There he is.
- That's not him! That's my brother!

1426
01:55:47,599 --> 01:55:49,639
What have you done?
That's my witness.

1427
01:55:49,851 --> 01:55:51,310
Get him a glass of water.

1428
01:55:55,107 --> 01:55:57,146
My poor brother.

1429
01:55:58,568 --> 01:55:59,979
You!

1430
01:56:01,238 --> 01:56:03,645
- Make way, please.
- Step aside.

1431
01:56:03,865 --> 01:56:05,276
What is it?

1432
01:56:05,492 --> 01:56:07,531
- I've just seen him.
- Where?

1433
01:56:07,744 --> 01:56:10,282
- There.
- Don't let anyone leave.

1434
01:56:10,497 --> 01:56:13,617
- Jacques, Henri, guard the entrance.
- Yes, sir.

1435
01:56:13,834 --> 01:56:17,748
Thank you. Ah!
There he is! That's him!

1436
01:56:18,755 --> 01:56:20,997
- Henri Verdoux?
- At your service.

1437
01:56:26,805 --> 01:56:28,963
Never in the history of jurisprudence

1438
01:56:29,182 --> 01:56:31,222
have such deeds
been brought to light.

1439
01:56:31,435 --> 01:56:35,515
Gentlemen, you have before you
a cruel and cynical monster.

1440
01:56:35,731 --> 01:56:37,189
Look at him!

1441
01:56:43,947 --> 01:56:46,153
This man, who has brains,

1442
01:56:46,366 --> 01:56:49,403
if he had decency,
could have made an honest living.

1443
01:56:49,619 --> 01:56:53,119
Yet, he preferred to rob
and murder unsuspecting women.

1444
01:56:53,331 --> 01:56:55,205
He made a business of it.

1445
01:56:55,417 --> 01:56:58,204
I ask for the protection of society.

1446
01:56:58,420 --> 01:57:01,753
For this mass killer,
I demand the extreme penalty.

1447
01:57:01,965 --> 01:57:06,129
That he be put to death
on the guillotine. The State rests.

1448
01:57:14,603 --> 01:57:17,354
M. Verdoux,
you have been found guilty.

1449
01:57:17,564 --> 01:57:20,600
Have you anything to say
before sentence is passed?

1450
01:57:23,987 --> 01:57:26,774
Oui, Monsieur, I have.

1451
01:57:26,990 --> 01:57:30,276
However remiss the Prosecutor
has been,

1452
01:57:30,494 --> 01:57:33,863
he at least admits
that I have brains.

1453
01:57:34,081 --> 01:57:36,618
Thank you, Monsieur, I have.

1454
01:57:36,833 --> 01:57:39,918
And for thirty-five years
I used them honestly.

1455
01:57:40,128 --> 01:57:44,078
After that, nobody wanted them.

1456
01:57:44,299 --> 01:57:46,968
So I was forced to go into business
for myself.

1457
01:57:47,177 --> 01:57:51,305
As for being a mass killer,
does not the world encourage it?

1458
01:57:51,515 --> 01:57:53,970
Is it not building weapons
of destruction

1459
01:57:54,184 --> 01:57:56,889
for the sole purpose of mass killing?

1460
01:57:57,104 --> 01:58:00,140
Has it not blown unsuspecting women

1461
01:58:00,357 --> 01:58:02,682
and little children to pieces.

1462
01:58:02,901 --> 01:58:06,151
And done it very scientifically.

1463
01:58:06,780 --> 01:58:10,778
As a mass killer,
I am an amateur by comparison.

1464
01:58:10,992 --> 01:58:13,697
However,
I do not wish to lose my temper,

1465
01:58:13,912 --> 01:58:16,948
because very shortly,
I shall lose my head.

1466
01:58:17,499 --> 01:58:19,408
Nevertheless...

1467
01:58:19,626 --> 01:58:23,125
Upon leaving this spark
of earthly existence,

1468
01:58:23,338 --> 01:58:26,007
I have this to say.

1469
01:58:26,216 --> 01:58:29,134
I shall see you all...

1470
01:58:29,344 --> 01:58:33,389
very soon... very soon.

1471
01:58:45,694 --> 01:58:48,019
- No pictures.
- Oh, Max, how is he?

1472
01:58:48,238 --> 01:58:52,450
He's nuts! Talks like he's a saint.
Twist everything with half-truths.

1473
01:58:52,659 --> 01:58:54,901
Says you can't have good
without evil.

1474
01:58:55,120 --> 01:58:58,121
Evil being the shadows
cast from the sun.

1475
01:58:58,331 --> 01:59:01,083
- He's kidding us.
- Alright, you can go in.

1476
01:59:01,293 --> 01:59:04,744
- So long, Max. See you later.
- Hope you get a better break.

1477
01:59:06,339 --> 01:59:08,083
No pictures.

1478
01:59:18,185 --> 01:59:20,889
Well, well, well. Verdoux.

1479
01:59:22,189 --> 01:59:24,940
You'll have to admit,
crime doesn't pay.

1480
01:59:25,150 --> 01:59:29,064
- No, sir. Not in a small way.
- What do you mean?

1481
01:59:29,279 --> 01:59:32,944
To be successful in anything,
one must be well organized.

1482
01:59:33,158 --> 01:59:36,075
You're not leaving
with that cynical remark?

1483
01:59:36,286 --> 01:59:40,747
To be idealistic at this moment
would be incongruous.

1484
01:59:40,957 --> 01:59:43,709
What's all this talk about
good and evil?

1485
01:59:43,919 --> 01:59:49,209
Arbitrary forces. Too much of either
will destroy us all.

1486
01:59:49,424 --> 01:59:51,796
We can never have too much good.

1487
01:59:52,010 --> 01:59:55,628
The trouble is, we've never
had enough. We don't know.

1488
01:59:55,847 --> 02:00:00,842
I've been your friend all through the
trial. Give me a story with a moral.

1489
02:00:01,061 --> 02:00:04,596
You, the tragic example
of a life of crime.

1490
02:00:04,815 --> 02:00:08,943
I don't see how anyone can be
an example in these criminal times.

1491
02:00:09,152 --> 02:00:12,402
You certainly are,
robbing and murdering people.

1492
02:00:12,614 --> 02:00:18,403
- That's business.
- Others don't do business that way.

1493
02:00:18,620 --> 02:00:21,193
That's the history of
many a big business.

1494
02:00:21,415 --> 02:00:23,740
Wars, conflict,

1495
02:00:23,959 --> 02:00:26,580
it's all business.

1496
02:00:26,795 --> 02:00:31,421
One murder makes a villain,
millions a hero.

1497
02:00:31,633 --> 02:00:33,709
Numbers sanctify, my good fellow.

1498
02:00:35,137 --> 02:00:38,837
- Father Ferro to see you.
- By all means, show him in.

1499
02:00:39,057 --> 02:00:42,142
You'll pardon me,
but my time is limited.

1500
02:00:44,980 --> 02:00:47,518
Is there anything else
you'd like to say?

1501
02:00:47,733 --> 02:00:49,809
Yes, goodbye.

1502
02:00:58,702 --> 02:01:00,493
Alright, Father.

1503
02:01:14,676 --> 02:01:18,756
Well, Father.
And what can I do for you?

1504
02:01:18,972 --> 02:01:21,843
Nothing, my son.
I want to help you, if I can.

1505
02:01:22,059 --> 02:01:24,763
I've come to ask you
to make peace with God.

1506
02:01:24,978 --> 02:01:29,391
I am at peace with God.
My conflict is with Man.

1507
02:01:29,608 --> 02:01:34,020
- Have you no remorse for your sins?
- Who knows what sin is.

1508
02:01:34,237 --> 02:01:37,653
Born as it was from heaven
from God's fallen angel?

1509
02:01:37,866 --> 02:01:40,950
Who knows the ultimate
destiny it serves?

1510
02:01:42,037 --> 02:01:45,655
After all, what would you be
doing without sin?

1511
02:01:45,874 --> 02:01:48,330
Exactly what I'm doing now,
my son.

1512
02:01:48,543 --> 02:01:52,126
Trying in my humble way
to help a lost soul in distress.

1513
02:01:52,339 --> 02:01:55,672
They're coming. Let me pray for you.

1514
02:01:55,884 --> 02:02:00,676
As you wish. But I don't think these
gentlemen want to be kept waiting.

1515
02:02:00,889 --> 02:02:03,261
May the Lord have mercy on your soul.

1516
02:02:03,475 --> 02:02:06,974
Why not?
After all, it belongs to Him.

1517
02:02:16,738 --> 02:02:21,068
Henri Verdoux, the Criminal Court
of Justice of the French Republic,

1518
02:02:21,284 --> 02:02:23,324
sentenced you to die.

1519
02:02:23,537 --> 02:02:26,988
It is now the order of the court
the sentence be carried out.

1520
02:02:27,207 --> 02:02:30,410
- Merci.
- Cigarette?

1521
02:02:30,627 --> 02:02:31,908
Thank you.

1522
02:02:34,548 --> 02:02:35,543
Here.

1523
02:02:35,757 --> 02:02:38,165
- What's that?
- Rum.

1524
02:02:38,385 --> 02:02:41,552
No, thank you. Oh, just a moment.

1525
02:02:42,764 --> 02:02:44,804
I've never tasted rum.
