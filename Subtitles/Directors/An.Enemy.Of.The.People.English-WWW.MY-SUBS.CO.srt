2
00:00:21,254 --> 00:00:22,846
Is it Janabarta's office?

3
00:00:23,656 --> 00:00:25,886
Am I Talking to the editor?

4
00:00:26,926 --> 00:00:30,657
Haridas, this is doctor
Gupta speaking, Ashok Gupta.

5
00:00:31,264 --> 00:00:35,564
Listen, I rang you
up to give you a news.

6
00:00:36,436 --> 00:00:40,668
Here in Chandipore, few
Jaundice cases have been found.

7
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:44,274
Yes, which we call
infective Hepatitis..

8
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:50,642
..Iike Typhoid,
Gastroentritis etc..

9
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:53,282
..these are also found.

10
00:00:53,653 --> 00:00:56,520
I find it in hospital,
as well as in the private patients.

11
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:00,289
So I want..

12
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:05,395
..you to publish this news in your
newspaper, so that people will be..

13
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:07,792
..careful about it.
- Is the source detected?

14
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:11,299
No. Not yet.

15
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:15,032
But the problem with the
water has not been revealed yet.

16
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:17,577
I have a doubt.
Shall I speak out?

17
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:23,174
- Certainly. - I suspect that the
chemical impurities of the paint..

18
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:26,548
..factory on the other
side of the river at Santoshpur..

19
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:28,883
..is drained into the river.

20
00:01:28,955 --> 00:01:32,220
I mention this because,
we already published.

21
00:01:32,358 --> 00:01:35,691
No no. This diseases are not
originated from chemical impurities.

22
00:01:35,862 --> 00:01:37,955
Of course, you will know it better.

23
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:40,566
So hopefully you are
going to publish this news.

24
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:44,567
Shall we title it as
lnfective Hepatitis or Jaundice?

25
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:48,738
Preferably Jaundice because people
are more familiar with this term.

26
00:01:48,808 --> 00:01:53,905
Ok. I will send a reporter
to you namely Sanat Das.

27
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:56,244
You please give him the
details of your address.

28
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:57,248
Fine.

29
00:01:57,317 --> 00:02:00,252
And I will also let you know
if there is any further news

30
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:12,952
Home made?

31
00:04:13,486 --> 00:04:15,613
Did you like it?
- Superb.

32
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:19,951
Only tea at office this time.
Gone crazy so I had it.

33
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:23,223
I too wonder, how you
managed to be here at this time

34
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,723
I heard that the news
editors are usually..

35
00:04:25,798 --> 00:04:27,732
..at their office till
twelve at night.

36
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,233
Right you are.

37
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:32,738
But as I said, I have some job
with the Doctor. Regarding news.

38
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,241
Usually he returns by this time

39
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:39,241
But yesterday he was telling
me about an acute patient.

40
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:42,911
What is the disease?
- He was telling about Jaundice

41
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:45,913
That is what he said.

42
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:47,919
There are some other cases too.

43
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:51,252
We have published in Janabarta.
It is the Doctor who informed us.

44
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:53,592
It never happened in Chandipore!

45
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:56,591
Even he looks too
worried for last few days.

46
00:04:56,796 --> 00:05:00,755
A big number of his private patients
are also effected by the same.

47
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:04,600
I wish it is for time being.

48
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,940
This Chandipore has
changed radically..

49
00:05:08,007 --> 00:05:10,601
.. after this Bhargab's
temple was established.

50
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,778
Shivratri is yet
another two months to come..

51
00:05:12,845 --> 00:05:15,939
Surprisingly from now only the
hotels and dharmshalas are booked up..

52
00:05:16,015 --> 00:05:18,609
..You can literally
call Chandipore a pilgrim.

53
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:20,547
I like this place..

54
00:05:20,753 --> 00:05:24,211
..as he was born here, he
spent his childhood here only.

55
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:30,885
Chandan. Of course for medical
studies he went to Calcutta.

56
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:34,733
After marriage we were
at Calcutta for some time.

57
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:37,903
He used to do practice there,
I didn't like it at all

58
00:05:38,604 --> 00:05:40,902
We are in peace after
coming here at Chandipore.

59
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:43,242
We liked small cities.

60
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:47,408
Of course like Calcutta
,here you will not find pollu..

61
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:50,249
Wow! What a surprise!

62
00:05:50,616 --> 00:05:52,584
Oh! No, can't come here
because of the workload.

63
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:56,247
One minute, let me introduce,
the editor Janabarta..

64
00:05:56,322 --> 00:05:57,914
..and he is my brother in law..

65
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,582
No need to introduce..

66
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:02,253
Running a news organisation wouldn't
I know the Chairman of Benepul?

67
00:06:02,328 --> 00:06:04,922
Elder brother hasn't returned
home yet, what's the matter?

68
00:06:04,997 --> 00:06:09,263
May be he is busy with some case.
Would you like to have tea?

69
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:12,270
No I just had.
- And some snacks?

70
00:06:12,338 --> 00:06:14,272
Of course not, lndigestion.

71
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:17,275
What is this, you are still
having indigestion problem?

72
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:20,207
What to do, the medicine which my
elder brother gave had no effect..

73
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:22,213
..so now a days I am
taking Kabirajee medicines.

74
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:25,216
So you will not have nothing?
- Only a glass of water.

75
00:06:27,253 --> 00:06:29,721
Now, tell me some thing
about your news paper.

76
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:31,553
Pulling on.

77
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:35,887
I guess you people have taken a bit
more of leftist way now a days?

78
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:37,554
Have the sale increased by that way?

79
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:39,231
Do you read our paper?

80
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:42,901
As Janabarta is the
only paper of Chandipore..

81
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:44,903
..so I often go through it.

82
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:50,572
The Jaundice news was published on
the day before yesterday, isn't it?

83
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:52,577
Yes, it was
intimated by the Doctor only.

84
00:06:52,945 --> 00:06:54,242
Strange!

85
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:57,245
Elder brother didn't
tell me anything about it!

86
00:06:57,316 --> 00:07:01,252
May be due to lack of time.
And you know him..

87
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,254
..he is so absent-minded.

88
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:05,591
What is he saying about it?

89
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:07,419
Nothing special.

90
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:09,595
But I can understand
that he is worried.

91
00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:11,596
But although Jaundice is found..

92
00:07:11,664 --> 00:07:14,929
..nobody can stop the
pilgrims from coming here.

93
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:17,595
After the foundation
of the temple..

94
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:19,604
..the visit if the pilgrims
increased for 3 times.

95
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:22,707
Well, what shall I tell you..

96
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:24,868
..you are the
president of Bhargav Trust.

97
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:27,212
So you visit the temple often?

98
00:07:28,247 --> 00:07:30,875
Yes of course. Both of us go.

99
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:35,550
I am not like brother.
I have faith on religion.

100
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:38,883
I got cured from spondilosis within
7 days after I visited the temple.

101
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:40,555
Really!

102
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:42,890
People say that the
Shiva here is very impulsive.

103
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:46,224
I think he has come.

104
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:50,235
I have some work with him.

105
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:53,572
But I have to go at
another place too.

106
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,573
What about your son?

107
00:07:56,275 --> 00:07:58,743
Probably he will stay back there.

108
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:01,914
You mean at America?
- I think so.

109
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:06,251
Oh God! It's Nisit.

110
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:08,587
Be seated first.

111
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:12,921
This Ranen was coming on foot,
I took him up in my car.

112
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:15,927
Please have a seat.
They are all waiting for you.

113
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:20,524
I was busy with a patient.
- Again Jaundice?

114
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:23,202
Yes, but survived this time.

115
00:08:23,402 --> 00:08:25,370
What about the hospital?

116
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:27,201
I just came over
here to know that only.

117
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:29,207
No, it is not the hospital..

118
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:32,540
..but the problem lies with
these diseases of recent onset.

119
00:08:32,745 --> 00:08:37,205
Are you getting the medicines
properly? Madhab wanted to know.

120
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:39,217
Yes yes there
is no scarcity at all.

121
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:43,722
But, we still could not detect
the source of the water problem.

122
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:47,556
Do you think it is
located at a specific area?

123
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,719
I could guess that way but,
again it is a matter of evidences.

124
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:54,233
We should observe more.

125
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:57,236
If ever you are in trouble..

126
00:08:57,303 --> 00:08:59,567
..please don't
hesitate to tell me that.

127
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:01,903
I don't think such
situation will arise.

128
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:05,574
Bhargav has really done a good
job by establishing this hospital.

129
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:07,579
Now there is no
scarcity in Chandipore.

130
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:08,739
I think..

131
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:12,579
..as far as small town is concerned,
our's is really incomparable.

132
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:15,914
I agree with you.

133
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:18,752
And even in cultural
field we are not left behind.

134
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:21,518
Well, this is Ranen
from Haldar's family.

135
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,854
Please tell him what
you all are doing.

136
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,528
We are doing our best.

137
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,201
We have formed a theatre group.

138
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,700
Doctor's daughter
also performs in it.

139
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:36,197
And since one year we have
published a magazine.

140
00:09:36,275 --> 00:09:39,540
Actually Ranen works in a bank.
Well paid.

141
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:41,204
Well, that's good.

142
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:45,210
What is the name of your magazine.
- Mashal.

143
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,220
Which way do you go through?

144
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,554
Right or left?

145
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:57,225
Well, magazines today has to
be a bit leftist naturally.

146
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:02,223
But we have just started.
We are facing lots of problems.

147
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:04,562
Readership is very less.

148
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,905
But tenacity is the main thing.

149
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,577
Spoke everything,
except the main one?

150
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:13,574
That I leave it to you.

151
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:16,911
What is it?
- He is our would be son in law.

152
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:17,915
Is it?

153
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:23,915
When is the function happening?
- In the month of Baisakh.

154
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,259
But Ranu is still studying,
isn't it? - Yes she is.

155
00:10:27,326 --> 00:10:29,988
But from next Baisakh it
is not that essential.

156
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:33,521
Because Ranen's this January month..

157
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:35,599
Hari Das you are sitting
quite for a long time.

158
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:39,259
What about you?
- I am waiting for your write up.

159
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:41,602
Which write up?
- About Chandipore.

160
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:45,273
You wrote about
Chandipore's climate earlier.

161
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:47,278
Now you can write
on any other topic.

162
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:49,280
As we were talking about culture..

163
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:51,612
..this can be a topic too.

164
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,289
No. Let's not write on this.

165
00:10:57,356 --> 00:10:58,288
Why?

166
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:02,291
Why not? It's good if
Chandipore can develop.

167
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:05,626
After reading the news of
Jaundice many are worried about it.

168
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,799
I was worried too.

169
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:10,301
Very much worried.

170
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,305
I am not in a mood to write.

171
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,638
But if you don't feel like writing..

172
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:18,973
..see, hope you are a
well wisher of Chandipore?

173
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:22,246
Definitely. Nobody than me.

174
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:24,583
Even not you.

175
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:25,582
Then!

176
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:31,248
We are trying to make Chandipore a
main tourist spot of West Bengal.

177
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:33,925
And we need active support from you.

178
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:36,261
Say for instance, the new issue..

179
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:39,263
..for this,
municipality is with you..

180
00:11:39,331 --> 00:11:40,593
..I assure you.

181
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:44,599
Are you leaving?
- Yes.

182
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:47,939
I will come again and have lunch.

183
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:49,599
Don't forget.

184
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:52,277
Ranen send a copy of your edition.

185
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:53,276
Oh yes. Certainly.

186
00:11:56,982 --> 00:11:59,951
Well, he was in good mood I think.

187
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:04,289
His mood becomes off..

188
00:12:06,992 --> 00:12:08,960
..when he has indigestion problem.

189
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:12,297
I thought he will be irritated
after getting my introduction.

190
00:12:12,364 --> 00:12:14,798
Did you hear what he
inquired about my paper?

191
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:16,801
Don't worry about that.

192
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:19,303
No. Actually I was confused.

193
00:12:19,371 --> 00:12:21,236
I didn't know what to say.

194
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:23,241
Nisit is conservative by nature.

195
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:25,911
I can't adjust with him.

196
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:31,239
But he has quality, skill,
which is really appreciable.

197
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:34,579
He is elected as Municipal
Chairman for 3 consecutive years.

198
00:12:34,653 --> 00:12:37,918
The idea of temple is his,
then Bhargav's hospital..

199
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:40,584
..now we can see so much
of visitors in Chandipore..

200
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:44,595
..I believe most of
this credit goes to Nisit.

201
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:47,595
Chandipore is..

202
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,268
The rice mill which Bhargav has..

203
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:52,270
..he is the partner there I suppose!

204
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:55,273
Rice mill, cold storage.

205
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:00,278
Fine. You all are chatting.

206
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:02,443
And I am working like anything.

207
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:05,617
Why are you so late today?
- Meeting.

208
00:13:06,652 --> 00:13:08,279
Will you have some tea?

209
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:14,623
Yes. - You are so off, can
I ask you some questions?

210
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:17,955
Please don't act. What question?

211
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:20,560
Do you have copies in your bag?

212
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:24,236
Yes. But it is ok, if
I don't check it today.

213
00:13:24,603 --> 00:13:28,562
If you have any proof,
give it to me I will check it.

214
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:34,246
Father I have a letter for you.

215
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:38,910
When did it come? - When I was going
out for school, the peon delivered.

216
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:44,248
Excuse me please.

217
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:47,592
What about your school?

218
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:51,259
It's just 5 months
- Do you like there?

219
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:53,264
Yes. It's fine.

220
00:13:53,632 --> 00:13:56,931
And at the end of the month when
I get the salary, I feel better.

221
00:13:58,304 --> 00:14:01,603
But whatever I am
teaching is not in my hand.

222
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:05,277
The one, which I teach, I don't
believe on that on most of the things.

223
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:07,942
But one thing I must say..

224
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:11,613
..everybody loves me a lot there.

225
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:15,287
The English story which
I gave you for translation..

226
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:17,288
.. I hope you have not done it yet.

227
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:22,218
I didn't get time at all. I
believe you are not in hurry!

228
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:27,232
Within a week I will..

229
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:35,240
What's the letter all about father?

230
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:46,747
What's the matter?

231
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:54,589
I anticipated correctly.

232
00:14:56,962 --> 00:14:58,589
I was right.

233
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:01,930
He has left.

234
00:15:02,968 --> 00:15:04,936
He could have listened to it.

235
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:07,272
I am becoming impatient.

236
00:15:08,974 --> 00:15:12,603
Listen, this is not only a letter.

237
00:15:12,811 --> 00:15:16,611
I sent the water of a specific
area of Chandipore to Kolkata..

238
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:17,944
..for analysis.

239
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:20,546
This is the report.

240
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:25,550
Water of which area?- The most
populated area of Chandipore.

241
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,222
Bhubanpally?

242
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:32,219
Yes Bhubanpally. And
this report says that..

243
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:36,732
..the drinking water of
that area is full of germs.

244
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:39,567
Maximum patients were
coming from that area..

245
00:15:39,638 --> 00:15:41,572
..so I sent the
sample water of that area.

246
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,742
Now it is proved that..

247
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:46,903
..the diseases, which are caused by,
water here in Chandipore..

248
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:49,243
..the main source
is that Bhubanpally.

249
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:51,579
But, that means
- What does that mean?

250
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,743
Our temple is at Bhubanpally only.

251
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:57,585
Just in the middle of Bhubanpally.

252
00:15:57,656 --> 00:15:59,590
Everybody is using that water.

253
00:15:59,658 --> 00:16:01,751
Not only using but drinking too.

254
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:03,590
Holy water of temple.

255
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:07,596
Holy water. The water which
is carrying full of germs people..

256
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:11,762
..are having it with devotional
pleasure due to superstition!

257
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:15,432
And the water they are
having is poisoning them.

258
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:19,607
But a question might rise..

259
00:16:19,678 --> 00:16:23,205
..where thousands of people
are having that holy water..

260
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:26,544
..why that is not affecting all.

261
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:30,714
Because human body has a
system to resist diseases..

262
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:32,883
..called immunity.

263
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:34,721
Many gets rid because of it.

264
00:16:34,793 --> 00:16:38,559
But among 1 00 people if a single
person is also effected by cholera..

265
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:41,224
... typhoid, then, well..

266
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,733
..that is a dangerous thing.

267
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:45,736
But how did such massacre occurred?
- A very easy answer.

268
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:49,567
The installation of
underground may be not done properly.

269
00:16:49,641 --> 00:16:52,906
So, there is crack on the
pipeline as well as on the drainpipe.

270
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:55,412
And these water mix with each other.

271
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:57,574
It happens in our
country very frequently.

272
00:16:57,783 --> 00:16:59,751
So what will you do now?

273
00:17:00,285 --> 00:17:02,253
I have to send this report..

274
00:17:02,621 --> 00:17:05,920
..to my brother
along with my opinion.

275
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,588
As the chairman of municipality he
has to take some step immediately.

276
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:15,255
And until the water of
the temple is purified..

277
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:17,268
..it should not be used.

278
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:20,529
And I have also..

279
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:24,872
..got the information
about natural source of water..

280
00:17:24,943 --> 00:17:29,539
..in Bhubanpally also the
number of tube wells is very less..

281
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:32,209
..so the whole system
has to be repaired..

282
00:17:32,284 --> 00:17:34,218
..there is no other way.

283
00:17:34,586 --> 00:17:35,712
Dr.Gupta..

284
00:17:36,922 --> 00:17:41,552
..can we publish this news?

285
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,227
You are asking me this? Strange!

286
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:45,229
Shall we mention
about the temple too?

287
00:17:45,297 --> 00:17:47,231
Why? Do you have any doubts?

288
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:51,233
No, actually this will
create lot of panic.

289
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:55,240
Yes.

290
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:58,243
Ok.

291
00:17:59,945 --> 00:18:02,743
You need not mention
Bhubanpally by name.

292
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:06,581
You can mention, a populated
area of Chandipore this way.

293
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:08,920
Let me see what my brother says..

294
00:18:08,987 --> 00:18:11,922
..then we can
publish it in big fashion.

295
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:14,589
This is just to alert people.

296
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:18,263
You have really done a great job.

297
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:22,198
You see, you will become a
national hero within few days.

298
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:30,196
No brother, I don't
want to be a hero.

299
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:32,877
I want to stay as a simple citizen.

300
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:36,214
The one which I have done..

301
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:40,211
..is as the duty of a doctor.

302
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,293
Maya.
- I am coming.

303
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,630
You returned so fast!

304
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,637
Nisit is coming.

305
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,303
He got my report.

306
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:42,313
Hari Das also called up.

307
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:44,975
He has some work too.

308
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,647
More patients have come?

309
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,316
Sushanta expired.

310
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:57,988
What! Expired!
- Yes.

311
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:05,667
Today at 6.30 a.m. But his
case was very critical of course.

312
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,676
Really sad.

313
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:16,670
There will be many more
if no step is taken immediately.

314
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,348
Brother in law will
definitely do something!

315
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,854
But the problem with him is..

316
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:28,015
..he is very jealous. Had he
himself discovered this, then..

317
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:34,865
He is Adhir Mukherji.

318
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,694
Our printer and publisher.

319
00:20:36,768 --> 00:20:38,360
Printer and publisher?

320
00:20:40,772 --> 00:20:42,364
..you will be
responsible in the view of law?

321
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:43,533
Oh yes.

322
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,873
He wants to tell you something.

323
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,706
Would you like to
have some tea or coffee.

324
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,384
Please have a seat.

325
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:58,548
You must have gone through the news.

326
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:00,384
I think it will work.

327
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,390
Please carry on.

328
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:06,397
I haven't come here to say some
thing about the objectionable news..

329
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:09,734
.. I came to give you my support.

330
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,069
How?

331
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:18,899
The discovery you have done,
haven't pleased everyone, I believe.

332
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:20,672
It hurts many..

333
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:23,681
.. to consider
Chandipore as an unhygienic place.

334
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:27,018
Many people told me,
after going through the news.

335
00:21:27,085 --> 00:21:28,347
Dr.Gupta is wrong..

336
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,684
..the water of
Chandipore just can't be polluted.

337
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:32,687
Is it so?

338
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:35,022
No, no, you need not
to think about it.

339
00:21:35,894 --> 00:21:39,022
Myself is the Chairman of three
numbers of Housing co-operative

340
00:21:39,398 --> 00:21:42,367
And the people who are the
members of these co-operatives..

341
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:44,698
.. I have quite a
good influence on them.

342
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:47,698
I can assure you that all
of them will be with you.

343
00:21:47,773 --> 00:21:49,035
It's my guaranty.

344
00:21:49,107 --> 00:21:50,369
I think..

345
00:21:50,442 --> 00:21:53,036
..it will strengthen you more.

346
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:55,039
It is a good news.

347
00:21:55,113 --> 00:21:57,377
It is not possible for
me to do anything alone.

348
00:21:57,449 --> 00:22:01,044
But what my brother
is going to decide..

349
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:03,053
..many thing depends on it.

350
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:07,051
I just wanted to convey my views
we all are with you.

351
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:10,390
If necessary we will call up a
meeting and will give you honour.

352
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:15,055
Of course exceeding
the limit of any thing..

353
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:16,395
.. I don't like.

354
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:18,569
Over acting never pay.

355
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:22,672
But since you have done
such a favor to the citizens..

356
00:22:22,874 --> 00:22:27,675
don't you feel they should pay
a minimum homage from their side

357
00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:33,347
This is not the right
time for honorarium.

358
00:22:33,418 --> 00:22:35,352
First let us get out of the crisis..

359
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,354
..after that those can take place.

360
00:22:37,422 --> 00:22:39,686
Any way, I just expressed my desire.

361
00:22:39,891 --> 00:22:43,850
Many thanks.- Okay then,
I am pushing off today.

362
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:46,363
You go ahead,
I will follow you after few time.

363
00:22:52,904 --> 00:22:54,872
Do you have five minutes time now?

364
00:22:55,741 --> 00:22:58,710
Yes, I have. Because my brother
is expected to come now.

365
00:22:59,077 --> 00:23:01,875
Ok let me finish it quickly.
- Ok tell me.

366
00:23:03,415 --> 00:23:05,883
The situation which
has been created..

367
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:10,377
..what you suggest should a
progressive newspaper do here?

368
00:23:11,423 --> 00:23:12,890
I think that..

369
00:23:13,091 --> 00:23:16,060
..the most important job
is to aware the citizen..

370
00:23:16,128 --> 00:23:19,063
..and have to draw the
attention of the authorities..

371
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:20,655
..so that immediate
solutions are made.

372
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:22,324
But who will solve it?

373
00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:26,003
You will suggest your brother,
the Chairman of the municipality.

374
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:27,663
A member of the municipality..

375
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:29,331
..but apart from your brother..

376
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:32,343
..there are also other bureaucrats
in the society, whom I know very much.

377
00:23:32,444 --> 00:23:35,675
When I published the news of fishes
dying in the river in my paper..

378
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:38,341
..then those people came to my
office and threatened me and said..

379
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:41,511
..they will see me if I publish
any adverse feature on Chandipore.

380
00:23:42,053 --> 00:23:45,022
In fact they highlighted the
prosperity of Chandipore..

381
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,684
..so that they can
built up their own wealth.

382
00:23:47,893 --> 00:23:52,023
The main attraction of Chandipore
is that Bhubaneswar temple.

383
00:23:52,397 --> 00:23:55,366
You will be astonished to hear
about the daily income of the temple.

384
00:23:55,734 --> 00:23:58,362
Not even a single portion of it
is going to those bureaucrats..

385
00:23:58,437 --> 00:23:59,870
.. I am the last
person to believe it.

386
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:02,532
I want to unmask them.

387
00:24:08,413 --> 00:24:11,712
Being an editor of a newspaper..

388
00:24:13,084 --> 00:24:15,052
..you must do your duty.

389
00:24:16,087 --> 00:24:17,884
I know these bureaucrats.

390
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:20,990
But, I have to think..

391
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:23,653
..about my own problems too.

392
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,327
As a doctor..

393
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:28,832
.. I cannot forget my
responsibilities.

394
00:24:29,034 --> 00:24:31,332
But if your brother
does not support you!

395
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:35,666
We must be ready for
all the consequences.

396
00:24:41,379 --> 00:24:46,681
The report that I sent..

397
00:24:48,053 --> 00:24:49,680
..are you ready to print it?

398
00:24:49,754 --> 00:24:52,848
Of course if I write
it in story format.

399
00:24:53,058 --> 00:24:55,026
Certainly.

400
00:24:55,727 --> 00:24:57,354
It's a very good proposal.

401
00:24:57,729 --> 00:25:00,698
Then, if Nisit does not support me..

402
00:25:00,765 --> 00:25:02,357
.. I will write it today itself.

403
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:04,368
Ranu will make a copy of
it after returning from school.

404
00:25:04,436 --> 00:25:05,698
She has beautiful hand writing

405
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:08,705
And I will take it to your
office today itself at night.

406
00:25:08,773 --> 00:25:11,367
Shall I make a move now?
- Ok.

407
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:14,878
I think there's nothing to worry.

408
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:16,710
Goodbye.

409
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:31,988
What do you do always
in the dinning room?

410
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:35,663
No, not in the dinning room.
I am telling a recipe to Kartik.

411
00:25:35,734 --> 00:25:37,668
Forget it. Please come and sit.

412
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:40,000
Please sit down.

413
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:47,345
What are you thinking?

414
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,352
After getting the report..

415
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:58,356
.. I have become restless.

416
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:03,357
I can understand.
I am also worried.

417
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:07,695
I know you will get a
tremendous pressure.

418
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:11,695
I know you work so hard.
And on top of that, this incident.

419
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:15,039
That is why there should
be an immediate solution.

420
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:18,035
But if brother in law does
not listen to you, then?

421
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:21,636
No. I don't believe this.

422
00:26:22,347 --> 00:26:24,645
He too loves Chandipore like me.

423
00:26:25,016 --> 00:26:26,984
At this crisis period,
he will go against me?

424
00:26:29,354 --> 00:26:31,322
I am thinking about his jealousy.

425
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:33,988
I am observing him
for last 30 years.

426
00:26:35,694 --> 00:26:36,991
But don't forget that...

427
00:26:37,062 --> 00:26:39,326
... he is who helped me
to get this job in the hospital.

428
00:26:39,531 --> 00:26:41,499
He only searched out
this house for me.

429
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:47,998
But he has done all these
after he established himself.

430
00:26:48,373 --> 00:26:50,000
Not before that.

431
00:26:53,044 --> 00:26:56,013
I would have been very happy,
if he was in your side.

432
00:26:56,081 --> 00:27:00,017
But
- But what?

433
00:27:00,885 --> 00:27:05,015
He is so different from you.
One cannot make out as brothers..

434
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:11,358
Oh! Mr. Biswal.

435
00:27:12,897 --> 00:27:15,024
Well I have introduced
Mr. Bhargav to you..

436
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,692
Oh yes. Would you
like to have some tea?

437
00:27:16,768 --> 00:27:17,860
No thanks.

438
00:27:19,404 --> 00:27:22,635
Please come
- Can we seat in your chamber?

439
00:27:23,341 --> 00:27:25,809
Yes, of course. Please come.

440
00:27:39,791 --> 00:27:41,418
What is the matter
tell me Mr. Bhargav?

441
00:27:46,431 --> 00:27:50,390
What have you done Dr.Gupta?
- Why?

442
00:27:50,935 --> 00:27:54,735
Nisit has shown me your report.

443
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,908
After seeing that I am stunned.

444
00:27:58,443 --> 00:28:01,742
When I got the water
laboratory report..

445
00:28:01,813 --> 00:28:03,405
.. I was also stunned.

446
00:28:03,481 --> 00:28:05,073
It is a serious matter indeed.

447
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:07,744
But why are you pulling my
temple issue in this context?

448
00:28:07,952 --> 00:28:11,410
Your temple is
just in the middle of Bhubanpally.

449
00:28:11,489 --> 00:28:13,923
Germ is found in
Bhubanpally's water.

450
00:28:13,992 --> 00:28:15,926
The same water is
used in temple too.

451
00:28:15,994 --> 00:28:18,428
And people are having this
water as the holy water.

452
00:28:24,402 --> 00:28:25,699
What is this?

453
00:28:26,071 --> 00:28:31,532
Do you know?
This is the holy water.

454
00:28:32,077 --> 00:28:35,376
Holy water from my own temple.

455
00:28:37,082 --> 00:28:38,549
I am giving you this.

456
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:42,713
You test it.

457
00:28:42,921 --> 00:28:46,880
If you discover a
single germ in it..

458
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:49,727
.. I will change my name.

459
00:28:50,095 --> 00:28:51,892
What the hell are you talking?

460
00:28:55,767 --> 00:29:00,067
Your medical science cannot
understand the properties of it.

461
00:29:00,438 --> 00:29:01,564
Dr.Gupta.

462
00:29:04,776 --> 00:29:12,410
This holy water and all the
holy water is free from germs.

463
00:29:21,392 --> 00:29:22,859
How funny!

464
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:25,691
No sir. Not funny.

465
00:29:26,898 --> 00:29:28,866
This is not just a tap water.

466
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,368
It contains water of Ganges too.

467
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:34,038
Otherwise how shall it
be used for worship?

468
00:29:35,406 --> 00:29:39,035
We get a regular supply of
Ganges water from Calcutta.

469
00:29:39,744 --> 00:29:46,047
Then there is a milk in it, there
is a bel leaves, there is a teel..

470
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:51,714
..and most important
that there is tulsi leaves.

471
00:29:56,427 --> 00:29:57,894
Do you know..

472
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:01,398
..that tulsi leaf purifies water?

473
00:30:05,436 --> 00:30:07,904
You will not know
all this Dr. Gupta.

474
00:30:08,773 --> 00:30:11,901
But Hindus have
knowledge of thousand of years.

475
00:30:13,778 --> 00:30:15,405
After having the prasad..

476
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,414
..many got sick and came to me.

477
00:30:22,453 --> 00:30:23,920
Your brother said that..

478
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:25,922
..you never visited to my temple..

479
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,753
..in these last ten years.

480
00:30:32,463 --> 00:30:35,432
You will not understand
the religion Hindu Dr. Gupta.

481
00:30:37,135 --> 00:30:39,763
So, you are not going to
look after the water problem?

482
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:42,102
There is nothing to
do with the temple.

483
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:43,765
There is no necessity.

484
00:30:45,476 --> 00:30:47,774
In that case, I have nothing to say.

485
00:30:48,813 --> 00:30:50,781
On the other hand, the numbers
of patients increasing day by day.

486
00:30:50,982 --> 00:30:53,109
You forget about the temple.

487
00:30:54,485 --> 00:30:56,453
Municipality will
look into the matter..

488
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:58,455
..so that the people of
Bhubanpally drink boiled water.

489
00:30:58,656 --> 00:31:01,124
More tube wells will be
installed if necessary.

490
00:31:01,492 --> 00:31:05,121
But do not blame my temple.

491
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:08,799
This is my request.

492
00:31:10,501 --> 00:31:15,461
Are you leaving? - Yes.
I have another appointment. - Ok.

493
00:31:28,453 --> 00:31:36,758
Nisit, I can well understand
your opinion is same as Bhargav.

494
00:31:38,463 --> 00:31:40,761
I have a question
- What?

495
00:31:41,466 --> 00:31:45,095
Couldn't you do
this by informing me?

496
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:47,438
But first of all one needs proof.

497
00:31:47,505 --> 00:31:51,441
No step can be taken on assumption.
When I got the proof I informed you.

498
00:31:51,809 --> 00:31:54,778
Did you place the report
infront of the samity?

499
00:31:54,846 --> 00:31:56,108
Immediately.

500
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:59,115
I have informed the
municipality officially.

501
00:31:59,183 --> 00:32:00,946
The number of patients
increasing day by day.

502
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:04,955
Bhargav might not like to listen
anything wrong about his temple..

503
00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:07,457
..but I cannot ignore
the laboratory test.

504
00:32:08,493 --> 00:32:09,790
If you..

505
00:32:10,495 --> 00:32:12,463
..take it for granted..

506
00:32:13,164 --> 00:32:15,132
..that the drain water is
mixing with the temple water..

507
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,468
..do you have any idea how much..

508
00:32:17,535 --> 00:32:21,403
..of time and money will be spend
to locate that area and repair that?

509
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:24,742
And at that time
temple has to be closed.

510
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:27,912
Thousands of people will
ask the reason behind it.

511
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:30,740
At this point of time
is there any other way?

512
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:33,751
If I speak like Bhargav..

513
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:37,755
..that as the holy water
contains tulsi leaves..

514
00:32:37,822 --> 00:32:39,414
..the water is purified.

515
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:41,922
And this is happening for long time.

516
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:45,425
My concern is the water
of Tripureswar temple.

517
00:32:45,496 --> 00:32:46,929
That water is polluted.

518
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:50,427
Some diseases, which was never found
in Chandipore earlier, is found now.

519
00:32:50,501 --> 00:32:51,763
Many patients died.

520
00:32:51,836 --> 00:32:55,431
The one who is suffering
either stays at Bhubanpally..

521
00:32:55,506 --> 00:32:57,770
..or goes to temple
everyday for worship.

522
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:00,444
I do agree everything brother.

523
00:33:00,511 --> 00:33:04,106
I request you to not to submit
this report to the committee.

524
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:06,450
I too will keep this a secret.

525
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:10,450
Bargav too will keep this a secret.
Even I too know that.

526
00:33:10,521 --> 00:33:12,955
But the others will not
shut their mouth.

527
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:17,116
People will never visit Chandipore
if the truth comes to light.

528
00:33:17,528 --> 00:33:19,120
It can be epidemic.

529
00:33:19,197 --> 00:33:22,394
I will look after it.
So that people drink boiled water.

530
00:33:22,467 --> 00:33:24,401
If more tube wells are installed.

531
00:33:24,469 --> 00:33:26,061
I will look after it.

532
00:33:26,137 --> 00:33:28,071
But the water of the
temple is the source..

533
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:29,731
..of the diseases,
don't spread this rumour.

534
00:33:29,807 --> 00:33:33,402
But some people guessed it already.

535
00:33:34,445 --> 00:33:38,745
How come? - Haven't you
seen Janabarta? - No.

536
00:33:46,457 --> 00:33:52,418
Chandipore is at stake.

537
00:34:19,157 --> 00:34:27,895
The thing which you've done you didn't
think about yourself and your family?

538
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:29,896
What do you mean?

539
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,739
Who arranged your job?

540
00:34:41,112 --> 00:34:45,412
You. And for that I am
ever grateful to you.

541
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:50,417
I thought if I make
some arrangement for you..

542
00:34:50,788 --> 00:34:52,756
..your rigidity will come down.

543
00:34:54,792 --> 00:34:56,760
You be careful.

544
00:34:57,128 --> 00:34:58,755
Am I not careful?

545
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:00,422
You got a new idea..

546
00:35:00,498 --> 00:35:02,432
..and you published
it all on a sudden.

547
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,097
Last you raised an issue..

548
00:35:04,168 --> 00:35:06,432
..that there should be a
children park in Chandipore..

549
00:35:06,504 --> 00:35:09,098
..but already a portion
of land was allotted from..

550
00:35:09,173 --> 00:35:10,435
..Bhargav trust in earlier to that.

551
00:35:10,808 --> 00:35:12,776
Well, I did not know that.

552
00:35:12,844 --> 00:35:14,778
You could have asked me.

553
00:35:14,979 --> 00:35:18,437
You should have informed me first,
when you received the chemical report.

554
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:20,708
Instead of that
you informed the newspaper

555
00:35:21,085 --> 00:35:23,713
What is the harm
if people is informed.

556
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:25,722
You are terribly wrong.

557
00:35:26,424 --> 00:35:28,392
This is a temple issue.

558
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:30,393
But they have not mentioned anything
about the temple in the paper.

559
00:35:30,761 --> 00:35:32,729
There is no name of Bhubanpally too.

560
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:34,560
Public is not that full.

561
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:36,395
Even a biri seller knows..

562
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:40,062
..that Bhubanpally is
the populated area here.

563
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:46,410
Now your responsibility is..

564
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:49,412
..to contradict
whatever you have said.

565
00:35:50,114 --> 00:35:52,742
I mean, you have to
write a letter to newspaper..

566
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:54,409
..that you were wrong.

567
00:35:54,785 --> 00:35:58,744
The matter is not that serious
as you anticipated.

568
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:02,085
But I will not tell a lie Nisit.

569
00:36:04,795 --> 00:36:07,423
Then being the
chairman of municipality..

570
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:10,433
.. I have to inform
the matter to them.

571
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:14,768
I will definitely protest.

572
00:36:15,139 --> 00:36:18,108
The most attraction of Chandipore
is Tripureswar temple.

573
00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:20,706
And the temple was my idea.

574
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:25,708
I will not tolerate
any propaganda on this temple.

575
00:36:28,085 --> 00:36:30,383
Think over what I said.

576
00:36:31,422 --> 00:36:36,382
I don't want you
to fall in big trouble.

577
00:36:37,762 --> 00:36:39,889
You are forgetting one thing Nisit..

578
00:36:40,431 --> 00:36:43,730
What?
- There is court.

579
00:36:44,769 --> 00:36:46,066
If you obstruct me..

580
00:36:46,437 --> 00:36:49,406
..I will be
helpless but to go to law.

581
00:36:49,607 --> 00:36:51,905
Do you know Nandi sir?

582
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:55,408
No. But his brother is my patient.

583
00:36:56,781 --> 00:36:58,408
Then you must know that..

584
00:36:58,783 --> 00:37:02,412
He goes to temple
twice a week for worship.

585
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:06,419
He will throw away the petition of
an non-religious person like you.

586
00:37:07,792 --> 00:37:10,920
I met Mr. Nandi last week.
He is in good health.

587
00:37:11,462 --> 00:37:16,764
He is not affected by
lnfective Hepatitis.

588
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,395
What happened?

589
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:48,064
What have you started,
you two brothers?

590
00:37:48,132 --> 00:37:50,066
I have heard your conversation.

591
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,397
I am shocked!

592
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:01,411
My own brother..

593
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:04,744
..said all these
rubbish to me at my house!

594
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:07,417
But I am not at all surprised.

595
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:13,746
Oh! How little I know him!

596
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:18,758
I never expected
such violent reaction.

597
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,530
As if the temple belongs to him!

598
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:26,696
Your brother
believes on god, worship.

599
00:38:26,904 --> 00:38:29,702
Tulsi purifies water!

600
00:38:30,408 --> 00:38:32,376
There is no germ in the holy water!

601
00:38:32,743 --> 00:38:34,370
Have you ever heard this anywhere?

602
00:38:36,747 --> 00:38:40,376
- Have you heard?
- Yes. I have heard this.

603
00:38:40,751 --> 00:38:43,049
My father said this,
when I was young.

604
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:47,387
Strange!

605
00:38:47,591 --> 00:38:50,059
Now the science is
included in the education system..

606
00:38:50,428 --> 00:38:52,055
..earlier it wasn't.

607
00:38:58,102 --> 00:39:00,400
Don't you feel like
going to the temple?

608
00:39:12,116 --> 00:39:13,083
Maya.

609
00:39:14,118 --> 00:39:15,415
Look at me.

610
00:39:17,455 --> 00:39:18,922
Tell me frankly..

611
00:39:19,623 --> 00:39:21,682
..don't you wish
to go to the temple?

612
00:39:23,728 --> 00:39:26,026
Why do you ask such question?
- Please answer.

613
00:39:29,066 --> 00:39:30,033
Now..

614
00:39:31,068 --> 00:39:34,037
..I do not want to keep any
difference between your and my wish.

615
00:39:36,407 --> 00:39:37,704
And earlier?

616
00:39:38,075 --> 00:39:42,034
As you do not believe on religion
I used to feel bad.

617
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:47,043
I should not lie.

618
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:52,389
But now I can realise..

619
00:39:53,424 --> 00:39:57,383
..without believing all these,
how honest a person can be.

620
00:39:59,764 --> 00:40:01,891
Maya, what's use of being honest?

621
00:40:05,102 --> 00:40:06,069
Well.

622
00:40:06,937 --> 00:40:09,064
I can understand that.

623
00:40:11,108 --> 00:40:13,076
Now cool down and think over.

624
00:40:13,144 --> 00:40:14,736
What will you do?

625
00:40:14,945 --> 00:40:17,743
It would have been better if,
Nisit was by my side.

626
00:40:18,783 --> 00:40:22,412
But, many things has to be
done without Nisit's support also.

627
00:40:22,486 --> 00:40:24,420
How do you say that?

628
00:40:26,791 --> 00:40:28,418
I am not alone, Maya.

629
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:32,088
A progressive daily is backing me.

630
00:40:33,464 --> 00:40:35,762
In context on this
situation they are..

631
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:38,768
..going to publish an extremely
important essay written by me.

632
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:42,439
Not even that, Mr.Adhir Babu
the publisher of that paper..

633
00:40:42,506 --> 00:40:44,440
..is the Chairman of three
number of Housing society.

634
00:40:45,142 --> 00:40:46,769
He gave me his word that..

635
00:40:46,844 --> 00:40:49,438
..all his members will
support me all the time.

636
00:40:50,481 --> 00:40:53,450
After all this how can
I say that I am alone?

637
00:41:38,229 --> 00:41:40,857
Mummy, dad has
written such a good essay..

638
00:41:40,931 --> 00:41:42,193
..and you are not looking into it.

639
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,197
Thanks.

640
00:41:44,268 --> 00:41:45,860
Tell me properly, how is it?

641
00:41:45,936 --> 00:41:48,200
Very nice, but dad..

642
00:41:48,572 --> 00:41:50,540
..will Janabarta publish it?

643
00:41:50,741 --> 00:41:53,539
Why? They have also
published my early write-up.

644
00:41:53,744 --> 00:41:55,712
Do you think both the
write-ups are the same?

645
00:41:55,779 --> 00:41:57,713
You never wrote such a
desperate write-up earlier.

646
00:41:58,249 --> 00:42:00,217
You are advising not
to take Charanamrita..

647
00:42:00,284 --> 00:42:01,717
..asking to close down the temple.

648
00:42:01,785 --> 00:42:03,719
That is because to prevent
further spreading of the disease.

649
00:42:03,787 --> 00:42:05,721
That has got no
relation with the religion.

650
00:42:05,789 --> 00:42:07,723
I doubt Janabarta will
publish these, or not.

651
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:11,558
But, Haridas personally told me
that he is going to publish it.

652
00:42:13,264 --> 00:42:15,562
It was Haridas, that's why I doubt.

653
00:42:15,633 --> 00:42:16,725
Why?

654
00:42:16,934 --> 00:42:18,902
I don't like that person at all.

655
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:21,170
His starring is
questionable itself.

656
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:24,174
This is your mere imagination.

657
00:42:24,241 --> 00:42:26,505
Haridas is a good person,
I have no doubt about it.

658
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:28,678
Hope it comes true.

659
00:42:28,746 --> 00:42:30,680
Hope it is my misreading.

660
00:42:30,748 --> 00:42:32,682
What do you thing?

661
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:37,847
Ranu is making a mistake.
It will be published.

662
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:40,524
Then I will be certainly happy.

663
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:43,193
Nobody spoke truth to
such extent earlier.

664
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:46,863
Don't you think
brother in law will take revenge?

665
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:49,529
I can not sit quiet for it.

666
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:51,861
I have to do my duty.

667
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:53,533
I do understand.

668
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:55,705
But I am very scared.

669
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,208
I know brother in law very well.

670
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:02,538
Both of you were never that close.

671
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:06,550
I did not forget the past.

672
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:11,551
Do you remember what happened
when uncle died? - Of course I do.

673
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:14,720
I told nothing to Ranu.

674
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:17,223
She was just born then.

675
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:20,157
What happened?

676
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:23,825
Your grandfather was very artistic.

677
00:43:25,202 --> 00:43:26,169
As a lawyer..

678
00:43:26,236 --> 00:43:28,500
..he earned quiet well.

679
00:43:29,206 --> 00:43:31,333
But he used to spend
more than his earning.

680
00:43:32,876 --> 00:43:34,844
When you were 4 years of age..

681
00:43:34,912 --> 00:43:37,176
..he died, leaving
huge amount of debt.

682
00:43:38,549 --> 00:43:40,517
Brother-in-law was
working at that time.

683
00:43:41,218 --> 00:43:45,678
But, he did not give a single penny
for the repayment of that loan.

684
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:50,519
Your father worked so hard
to pay back this loan amount.

685
00:43:50,728 --> 00:43:57,531
At that period how the family
was run, only I know.

686
00:43:58,235 --> 00:43:59,532
On top of that..

687
00:43:59,903 --> 00:44:02,201
They are bound to
publish this article.

688
00:44:02,573 --> 00:44:04,541
Let me go and hand it over to them.

689
00:44:04,608 --> 00:44:05,870
But at this hour?

690
00:44:05,943 --> 00:44:07,877
I have committed this to Haridas.

691
00:44:07,945 --> 00:44:09,537
He will be staying there.

692
00:44:25,195 --> 00:44:27,163
I am really scared.

693
00:44:27,564 --> 00:44:28,826
Me too.

694
00:44:31,201 --> 00:44:34,500
Those who are good,
suffer the most.

695
00:45:24,188 --> 00:45:25,485
Did you read it?

696
00:45:26,857 --> 00:45:28,154
Such a write up..

697
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:31,160
..will be published in our paper.
I am really excited to think about it.

698
00:45:32,196 --> 00:45:33,493
Listen this.

699
00:45:34,531 --> 00:45:36,499
I am doing my duty as a doctor..

700
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:38,831
..since last 26 years.
I am telling..

701
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:43,339
..Chandipore never
faced such a crisis period.

702
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:45,508
If an immediate
action is not taken..

703
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:47,168
..there will be disaster.

704
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:51,180
This is not only the responsibility
of the authorities to take care of..

705
00:45:51,248 --> 00:45:53,682
..it but the entire people
has to take part in it.

706
00:45:53,884 --> 00:45:55,852
It is really astonishing that..

707
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:59,184
..the water of Tripureswar
temple is also proved polluted.

708
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:02,851
If out of religion emotion
people drink this water..

709
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:05,861
..there will be no way to stop
the spreading of the diseases.

710
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:08,523
This water should be
purified immediately.

711
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:12,698
This is the only way to
protect Chandipore from this danger.

712
00:46:14,571 --> 00:46:16,539
This is really an
excellent write up.

713
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:19,542
People will be certainly
aware after reading it.

714
00:46:20,844 --> 00:46:22,471
I am afraid about it.

715
00:46:24,181 --> 00:46:25,148
Why?

716
00:46:27,518 --> 00:46:29,645
Today I received 1 7 letters.

717
00:46:30,854 --> 00:46:33,482
What letters?
- Letters from the readers.

718
00:46:33,857 --> 00:46:38,157
What have they written?
- Ashok Gupta is wrong.

719
00:46:39,196 --> 00:46:41,494
Water of Chandipore
cannot be polluted.

720
00:46:41,865 --> 00:46:43,162
They are illiterate.

721
00:46:43,233 --> 00:46:45,667
They are denying
scientific evidence.

722
00:46:45,736 --> 00:46:48,170
You please publish the
write up Mr. Haridas.

723
00:46:48,238 --> 00:46:50,172
This will definitely increase..

724
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:53,505
..the prestige of
our paper 1 0 times.

725
00:46:53,577 --> 00:46:56,171
We never published
this sort of news earlier.

726
00:46:56,246 --> 00:46:58,180
And Dr.Gupta also did not
write such an article before.

727
00:46:59,883 --> 00:47:01,851
I do not know him physically.

728
00:47:02,219 --> 00:47:04,187
But after reading this article..

729
00:47:04,254 --> 00:47:08,190
.. I can't express how much of respect
I am having for that gentleman.

730
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:10,686
You can find such a
man one in a lakh.

731
00:47:10,761 --> 00:47:12,524
We will not support him!

732
00:47:13,897 --> 00:47:16,525
Adhirbabu is
thinking something else.

733
00:47:17,234 --> 00:47:19,202
But we should not think otherwise.

734
00:47:19,269 --> 00:47:24,468
This is a hammering. At present
this is only required - May I come in?

735
00:47:24,541 --> 00:47:25,803
Please come in sir.

736
00:47:25,876 --> 00:47:28,140
We were talking about you only.
- Really?

737
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:32,137
He is our assistant editor.
- I see.

738
00:47:32,216 --> 00:47:35,151
Well I must..
- What are doing?

739
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:42,485
I never read such a
beautiful write up.

740
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:47,490
This is an assistant
editor's compliment.

741
00:47:47,564 --> 00:47:49,156
What does the editor say?

742
00:47:49,233 --> 00:47:51,827
You know that I am a fan of yours.

743
00:47:51,902 --> 00:47:53,665
So what is the problem? Publish it.

744
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:58,171
Of course. But let me
tell you something.

745
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:01,670
I received these
letters today by post.

746
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:04,840
What letters?
- Here they don't believe..

747
00:48:04,915 --> 00:48:07,179
..that water of
Chandipore is polluted.

748
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:15,522
I see. They consider
Chandipore as heaven.

749
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:19,188
They do not want to listen to
any adverse about the place.

750
00:48:20,163 --> 00:48:22,791
But there are
different type of people too.

751
00:48:23,166 --> 00:48:25,134
Yes. Among your readers only.

752
00:48:25,836 --> 00:48:28,464
They believe that even
being an ideal town..

753
00:48:28,538 --> 00:48:32,474
..calamities might occur anytime.

754
00:48:32,676 --> 00:48:35,474
They don't deny the
scientific proof..

755
00:48:35,545 --> 00:48:37,479
..Iike illiterate, impractical.

756
00:48:37,848 --> 00:48:39,816
They know that if germs spread..

757
00:48:39,883 --> 00:48:41,646
..there will be disaster.

758
00:48:42,185 --> 00:48:44,813
And that will be an
extreme accident..

759
00:48:44,888 --> 00:48:48,654
..they do believe. And that it
should not happen they believe.

760
00:48:49,526 --> 00:48:51,494
They are my true readers.

761
00:48:52,195 --> 00:48:53,822
I don't believe..

762
00:48:53,897 --> 00:48:57,492
..that they will deny my write up.

763
00:48:58,368 --> 00:49:00,495
You publish it
- Hello doctor.

764
00:49:01,204 --> 00:49:03,502
I heard your voice.
So I came to meet you.

765
00:49:03,874 --> 00:49:05,501
Did you gone through my write up?

766
00:49:05,575 --> 00:49:06,837
No. I will read it.

767
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:09,504
I am busy with some other job.
I will read it after sometime.

768
00:49:10,213 --> 00:49:12,681
I hope nothing will go
wrong because of you?

769
00:49:13,216 --> 00:49:17,846
If you write, keeping me
in mind, I have no problem.

770
00:49:18,889 --> 00:49:20,447
What do you mean?

771
00:49:20,657 --> 00:49:22,784
About the limit.

772
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:26,129
I will be in problem, if
one crosses the limit.

773
00:49:27,164 --> 00:49:28,791
Listen Adhirbabu.

774
00:49:29,166 --> 00:49:31,134
The degree of Chandipore's problem..

775
00:49:31,201 --> 00:49:34,637
..is thousand times
more than your problem.

776
00:49:35,172 --> 00:49:37,140
We should think about
ourselves at this time.

777
00:49:37,507 --> 00:49:40,476
The whole town is covered by danger.

778
00:49:40,544 --> 00:49:44,480
And the main way of remedy
is to publish my write-up.

779
00:49:47,184 --> 00:49:49,152
Ok, if you say so..

780
00:49:49,219 --> 00:49:52,814
Yes. Adhirbabu I am
telling this confidently.

781
00:49:52,889 --> 00:49:54,823
And I want your support.

782
00:49:55,859 --> 00:49:56,826
Ok.

783
00:49:57,194 --> 00:49:59,822
I will take your
write up after I return.

784
00:50:01,865 --> 00:50:04,163
Now I leave. Patients are waiting.

785
00:50:04,368 --> 00:50:06,165
You send the article for compose.

786
00:50:06,236 --> 00:50:08,170
I will come and check
the proof in the evening.

787
00:50:08,872 --> 00:50:11,170
Well
- What is it?

788
00:50:12,209 --> 00:50:15,508
We have to take a big risk
by publishing this article.

789
00:50:15,579 --> 00:50:17,171
I believe you understand that.

790
00:50:17,881 --> 00:50:19,508
If you do not take risk..

791
00:50:19,583 --> 00:50:21,676
..then why addressing
yourself progressive?

792
00:50:22,552 --> 00:50:23,678
You say that..

793
00:50:23,887 --> 00:50:26,685
..the readers only are the
policy makers of your paper.

794
00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:29,188
You too have a
responsibility to build them up.

795
00:50:29,393 --> 00:50:31,520
To develop their thoughts.

796
00:50:31,895 --> 00:50:33,362
Keep that in mind.

797
00:50:44,574 --> 00:50:46,701
Adhirbabu got scared
after reading the article.

798
00:50:47,911 --> 00:50:49,538
Yes. He is very shaky.

799
00:50:50,914 --> 00:50:53,712
Talking about limit
is just an excuse.

800
00:50:55,585 --> 00:50:57,883
Can't we go without it?

801
00:50:58,922 --> 00:51:00,549
How is it possible?

802
00:51:01,258 --> 00:51:04,227
Who will help us when we
need money for printing?

803
00:51:08,598 --> 00:51:12,557
But do not compromise
this for this write up.

804
00:51:16,273 --> 00:51:17,240
Come in.

805
00:51:20,877 --> 00:51:22,174
Please come in.

806
00:51:28,218 --> 00:51:30,846
Your father came few minutes ago
- Oh really!

807
00:51:32,222 --> 00:51:34,520
I came to return this book.

808
00:51:36,893 --> 00:51:38,861
But what about the translation?

809
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:40,692
Did you read this story?

810
00:51:41,565 --> 00:51:42,862
No. I did not.

811
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:44,867
But I heard this is popular.

812
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:45,333
So I thought of
publishing it on Sunday issue.

813
00:51:47,404 --> 00:51:49,201
I read it yesterday night.

814
00:51:49,272 --> 00:51:50,705
It is too bad.

815
00:51:51,241 --> 00:51:53,539
It does not match
your paper's principal.

816
00:51:54,911 --> 00:51:57,209
Why? What is there in the story?

817
00:51:57,914 --> 00:52:02,214
All the impractical, false
things which I don't believe at all.

818
00:52:02,919 --> 00:52:06,218
It said that there is a
supernatural power on the earth..

819
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:08,883
..which saves the honest people
and punishes the dishonest ones.

820
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:11,223
You tell me, does it make any sense?

821
00:52:14,264 --> 00:52:15,731
You are laughing!

822
00:52:16,933 --> 00:52:22,496
Indrani madam let me tell you,
our readers want this.

823
00:52:23,874 --> 00:52:26,502
We earn by running
this poor newspaper.

824
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:29,508
If we were well to do, should
we publish this sort of story?

825
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:32,508
You consider your
paper as a poor paper.

826
00:52:33,216 --> 00:52:35,844
But your office
does not reflect that.

827
00:52:36,887 --> 00:52:40,186
Anyway. I will not
translate this story.

828
00:52:40,891 --> 00:52:43,189
I don't believe on a
single word of it.

829
00:52:43,393 --> 00:52:46,521
I don't understand, how you
are thinking of publishing this?

830
00:52:46,596 --> 00:52:49,531
Specially when your paper is going
to publish such an important news.

831
00:52:50,734 --> 00:52:52,861
Are you talking about your
father's write up? - Yes.

832
00:52:52,936 --> 00:52:54,528
Hope you will publish that?

833
00:52:54,905 --> 00:52:56,532
That is what we are planning.

834
00:52:58,241 --> 00:53:00,209
This is really appreciable.

835
00:53:01,912 --> 00:53:06,212
If I publish this news, do you
know the main reason behind it?

836
00:53:06,283 --> 00:53:08,217
What is it?
- I understand.

837
00:53:08,285 --> 00:53:11,550
What? - My father
deliberately speaks the truth.

838
00:53:11,922 --> 00:53:13,890
And he writes well.

839
00:53:14,591 --> 00:53:19,221
Of course that is one of the reason.
But there is some other reason too.

840
00:53:20,197 --> 00:53:26,158
What?
- He is your father.

841
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:30,173
What are you talking about?

842
00:53:30,707 --> 00:53:32,174
I am telling you the truth.

843
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:35,174
So many times I had
been to your house to..

844
00:53:35,245 --> 00:53:36,837
..collect your father's write up.

845
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:39,842
The reason is to see you for once.

846
00:53:39,916 --> 00:53:41,850
Didn't you understand that?

847
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:46,519
No I didn't. And I don't want to..
- Please do not be angry.

848
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:50,519
It's not that I don't
respect your father.

849
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:54,527
Respect! You are cheating my father.

850
00:53:54,598 --> 00:53:57,863
What sort of person are you?
You are being too rude.

851
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:05,869
Is it worthy at this point of time?

852
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:09,212
What do you mean by that?

853
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:12,870
If Janabarta does not
lift up your father..

854
00:54:12,949 --> 00:54:14,883
..he will not be able to stand.

855
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:19,218
I do understand.
I am leaving.

856
00:54:29,866 --> 00:54:32,164
You had a visitor,
so I could not inform you.

857
00:54:32,235 --> 00:54:34,169
The chairman of
municipality has come.

858
00:54:39,876 --> 00:54:41,844
Sorry sir for making waiting.

859
00:54:41,911 --> 00:54:44,175
I saw my brother's daughter!
- Come.

860
00:54:44,881 --> 00:54:48,180
I gave her a story for
English translation.

861
00:54:51,221 --> 00:54:52,688
Please sit.

862
00:54:58,561 --> 00:55:00,188
What can I do for you?

863
00:55:00,730 --> 00:55:04,689
Yesterday one unwanted
incident occurred - What is it?

864
00:55:05,902 --> 00:55:07,870
It is related with my elder brother.

865
00:55:08,905 --> 00:55:12,864
He gave a report to the
temple committee and municipality.

866
00:55:13,576 --> 00:55:15,203
In spite of my objection.

867
00:55:15,912 --> 00:55:17,880
It's a deadly report.

868
00:55:18,915 --> 00:55:20,644
I know about the incident.

869
00:55:22,185 --> 00:55:26,485
How come? - He has send an
article based on that report.

870
00:55:27,857 --> 00:55:29,154
Here it is.

871
00:55:35,198 --> 00:55:37,166
Have you gone through it?

872
00:55:37,534 --> 00:55:39,661
Yes
- Are you publishing it?

873
00:55:41,538 --> 00:55:43,836
I have not decided yet.

874
00:55:47,877 --> 00:55:49,845
Don't you understand that
if you publish this news..

875
00:55:49,913 --> 00:55:51,505
..you will be in great trouble?

876
00:55:51,881 --> 00:55:54,850
He said not to drink the
holy water, to close the temple.

877
00:55:54,918 --> 00:55:58,183
To replace the
underground pipe by new pipe.

878
00:55:58,254 --> 00:56:01,189
Don't you think this
is a crazy statement?

879
00:56:01,891 --> 00:56:03,518
Will your readers agree this?

880
00:56:05,261 --> 00:56:09,527
One minute - Is he taking
brother's article for composing?

881
00:56:09,899 --> 00:56:13,528
He is Adhir Mukherji.
Our printer and publisher.

882
00:56:13,903 --> 00:56:15,871
Printer and publisher?

883
00:56:16,239 --> 00:56:17,866
Good morning sir.

884
00:56:18,908 --> 00:56:21,138
Have you read my brother's article?

885
00:56:21,344 --> 00:56:24,643
Are you talking about
Dr.Gupta's article?

886
00:56:24,848 --> 00:56:26,645
Yes. He is my brother.

887
00:56:26,716 --> 00:56:28,650
No I haven't. But I am
going to read that now.

888
00:56:28,718 --> 00:56:33,815
Do you know, you will be in
trouble if you publish that article?

889
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:37,656
Really! I have no idea about it.

890
00:56:38,194 --> 00:56:40,162
Do you go to the temple?

891
00:56:40,530 --> 00:56:44,489
Temple?
- Yes - I do go sometime.

892
00:56:45,201 --> 00:56:47,669
Do you drink the holy water?

893
00:56:48,204 --> 00:56:50,172
Why, is it wrong?

894
00:56:51,207 --> 00:56:56,167
From now onwards it is prohibited
- What?

895
00:56:57,213 --> 00:56:59,181
That's Dr. Ashok Gupta's order.

896
00:56:59,549 --> 00:57:01,517
And the temple will be closed..

897
00:57:01,584 --> 00:57:03,518
..for an indefinite period.

898
00:57:03,887 --> 00:57:07,516
What? Does the
article contain all these?

899
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:11,526
Yes - You are asking me
to publish such news?

900
00:57:13,563 --> 00:57:15,531
Listen editor sir.

901
00:57:16,232 --> 00:57:19,531
I brought a notice
from municipality.

902
00:57:20,170 --> 00:57:21,797
Let me read this.

903
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:27,798
On behalf of the municipality
Chandipore, we would like to inform..

904
00:57:27,877 --> 00:57:31,142
..that regarding the water of
a specific area of this town..

905
00:57:31,214 --> 00:57:34,809
..someone is
conducting a false campaign.

906
00:57:35,852 --> 00:57:41,154
Don't be misguided
and frightened by this evil act.

907
00:57:41,524 --> 00:57:44,152
We have conducted several
testings by the experts..

908
00:57:44,227 --> 00:57:46,161
..on the water of different areas.

909
00:57:46,229 --> 00:57:48,163
And came out with the fact..

910
00:57:48,231 --> 00:57:50,665
..that this water
is absolutely safe.

911
00:57:51,367 --> 00:57:55,167
We show our hatred..

912
00:57:55,238 --> 00:57:58,173
..to such a misleading campaign..

913
00:57:58,374 --> 00:58:00,842
..the chairman,
Chandipore municipality.

914
00:58:01,878 --> 00:58:05,507
Dr.Gupta has come. I saw
him getting out of the car.

915
00:58:06,216 --> 00:58:07,183
Biresh..

916
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:09,514
..you please take the
chairman sir at your cabin.

917
00:58:09,586 --> 00:58:10,848
Sir, if you please..

918
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:13,855
Why shall I go?
I will stay here.

919
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:25,628
Oh! I find my younger brother here!

920
00:58:26,836 --> 00:58:28,133
I think..

921
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:31,804
..you have come here to stop
the publishing of my article.

922
00:58:32,175 --> 00:58:33,802
Yes. That is my main objective.

923
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:36,638
You will not succeed.

924
00:58:37,847 --> 00:58:41,647
You don't know, I returned from
this place just few minutes ago.

925
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:45,643
I have come here again
to make some corrections.

926
00:58:45,855 --> 00:58:47,482
Please pass me the article for once.

927
00:58:47,557 --> 00:58:49,491
I have not received it yet.

928
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:57,162
My article will be
published in tomorrow's Janabarta.

929
00:58:58,868 --> 00:59:01,166
There is a possibility
of epidemic in the town..

930
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:04,499
..which people don't know now,
will come to know tomorrow.

931
00:59:11,881 --> 00:59:14,850
I believe people will
follow my instruction.

932
00:59:15,218 --> 00:59:18,847
That will be good for
Chandipore of course.

933
00:59:22,659 --> 00:59:25,457
Did Haridasbabu gave you word?

934
00:59:25,662 --> 00:59:27,789
Certainly.

935
00:59:33,169 --> 00:59:34,466
No, actually.

936
00:59:34,537 --> 00:59:36,471
Speak out clearly.

937
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:39,808
I thought of supporting doctor..

938
00:59:39,876 --> 00:59:43,812
..but that is, before
reading the article.

939
00:59:44,347 --> 00:59:47,805
But now I changed my mind
- Oh, I see.

940
01:00:02,532 --> 01:00:04,659
What are you saying Abinash?

941
01:00:05,868 --> 01:00:07,165
You came all on a sudden..

942
01:00:07,236 --> 01:00:09,500
..so I could not tell you that.

943
01:00:10,206 --> 01:00:13,505
We cannot publish your article.

944
01:00:13,876 --> 01:00:16,845
Janabarta is run
under many difficulties.

945
01:00:17,547 --> 01:00:19,674
The way you have
raised the temple issue..

946
01:00:19,882 --> 01:00:22,851
So you think, that whatever
I have told about temple is false.

947
01:00:22,919 --> 01:00:24,853
Here my opinion has no value at all.

948
01:00:25,221 --> 01:00:26,848
It's the public.

949
01:00:27,724 --> 01:00:29,851
It's impossible to run a
newspaper denying public opinion.

950
01:00:29,926 --> 01:00:33,521
How do you say that public
will disagree in advance?

951
01:00:33,730 --> 01:00:35,527
Do you think that
you know everything?

952
01:00:35,598 --> 01:00:37,532
Do you have the keys
of public mind?

953
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:41,859
I am running the paper for last
4 years. I have that experience.

954
01:00:41,938 --> 01:00:44,202
You publish this and
just see what happens.

955
01:00:44,273 --> 01:00:46,207
I will take all the responsibility.

956
01:00:46,909 --> 01:00:48,536
If this is published..

957
01:00:48,611 --> 01:00:51,205
..our readership will
decrease on 4 is to 1 basis.

958
01:00:51,748 --> 01:00:53,545
Then we have to wind
up the publication.

959
01:01:00,256 --> 01:01:04,215
But, earlier you said..

960
01:01:07,263 --> 01:01:10,232
You said such big things
at my house yesterday!

961
01:01:17,273 --> 01:01:19,241
Call me after half an hour.

962
01:01:21,878 --> 01:01:23,846
You discard the temple issue.

963
01:01:23,913 --> 01:01:31,183
I will publish your article
- I am a doctor.

964
01:01:32,722 --> 01:01:34,849
Don't I have a
responsibility towards the society?

965
01:01:36,225 --> 01:01:38,523
Germ is found in the water..

966
01:01:39,228 --> 01:01:41,696
.. I can't disclose
this through a paper?

967
01:01:43,232 --> 01:01:45,700
I am very sorry doctor.

968
01:01:46,903 --> 01:01:48,871
Are you a human being?

969
01:01:56,913 --> 01:01:58,540
And what about you?

970
01:01:58,915 --> 01:02:01,213
If you write such an article..

971
01:02:01,284 --> 01:02:03,218
..how will I print?

972
01:02:04,253 --> 01:02:07,552
And how shall I let my members do so?

973
01:02:15,264 --> 01:02:16,731
I leave the article.

974
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:18,733
Tomorrow it should be
published in the front page.

975
01:02:18,801 --> 01:02:22,828
Ok, fine - You think you
can stop me so easily?

976
01:02:23,539 --> 01:02:28,670
I will call for a meeting.
People will listen the matter.

977
01:02:28,878 --> 01:02:30,175
Meeting?

978
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:32,848
Where will you call for the meeting?

979
01:02:33,216 --> 01:02:34,183
Why?

980
01:02:34,550 --> 01:02:37,178
Ramanath hall is there.
Vivekananda hall is there.

981
01:02:37,553 --> 01:02:39,521
You will get none of them.

982
01:02:40,556 --> 01:02:42,683
That means you will
make such arrangements?

983
01:02:46,229 --> 01:02:47,196
Ok.

984
01:02:47,897 --> 01:02:51,856
I don't need any hall.
I will arrange it on the ground.

985
01:02:52,235 --> 01:02:54,533
I will be present there.

986
01:02:55,905 --> 01:02:58,203
You want to mess up
my public addressing?

987
01:02:58,574 --> 01:03:00,872
What will you do, if
Chandipore goes under epidemic?

988
01:03:01,577 --> 01:03:05,206
Even if it happens, it will not be
due to the drinking of holy water..

989
01:03:15,758 --> 01:03:18,886
I am inviting all of you
on my public meeting.

990
01:03:19,262 --> 01:03:21,162
Let me see what you can do.

991
01:03:42,218 --> 01:03:44,186
Do you want to say something?

992
01:03:45,221 --> 01:03:47,189
What have you done Mr. Haridas?

993
01:03:49,225 --> 01:03:50,852
What do you mean to say?

994
01:03:50,927 --> 01:03:54,863
You will not publish the article?
You fail to keep your commitment?

995
01:03:56,399 --> 01:04:00,529
Look here Biresh. I am the
editor of this newspaper.

996
01:04:00,736 --> 01:04:03,534
I will decide what will
be published and what not.

997
01:04:04,907 --> 01:04:06,704
Had you published the article..

998
01:04:07,243 --> 01:04:09,711
..it would have been
good for Janabarta.

999
01:04:10,413 --> 01:04:12,711
As well as
supporting an honest person.

1000
01:04:13,583 --> 01:04:15,710
How do you disagree with the crisis?

1001
01:04:15,918 --> 01:04:17,886
There is a scope of epidemic.

1002
01:04:18,254 --> 01:04:20,484
I don't want to discuss with
you on this matter further.

1003
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:22,657
You go to your room.

1004
01:04:57,293 --> 01:04:59,090
What's the matter?
You are here at this time!

1005
01:04:59,262 --> 01:05:00,991
Your father called me up.

1006
01:05:01,564 --> 01:05:03,031
Where is father?

1007
01:05:03,499 --> 01:05:05,831
In the cabin.
There are patients.

1008
01:05:06,569 --> 01:05:09,538
Why did he call you?
- It's a big story.

1009
01:05:10,239 --> 01:05:12,537
Janabarta will not publish
your father's article.

1010
01:05:12,608 --> 01:05:13,870
They have refused to do so.

1011
01:05:14,577 --> 01:05:16,044
I knew it earlier.

1012
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:18,877
I had been to their
office today in the afternoon.

1013
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:21,816
Haridasbabu is a bad man.

1014
01:05:22,184 --> 01:05:24,152
And their newspaper is also bad.

1015
01:05:25,187 --> 01:05:27,155
So now, your father
wants to disclose..

1016
01:05:27,223 --> 01:05:28,815
..the fact through a public meeting.

1017
01:05:29,025 --> 01:05:30,822
But no hall is available.

1018
01:05:31,193 --> 01:05:32,160
Why?

1019
01:05:32,862 --> 01:05:35,160
Your uncle has
made such arrangement.

1020
01:05:37,533 --> 01:05:43,836
Oh god! - Can you believe this. Two
brothers are just like two enemies.

1021
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:46,838
He called me up so that,
we can arrange a public..

1022
01:05:46,909 --> 01:05:48,843
..addressing in the temple.

1023
01:05:49,545 --> 01:05:51,513
I have discussed the
matter with my uncle.

1024
01:05:51,580 --> 01:05:55,016
He has agreed immediately.
He is very fond of your father.

1025
01:05:55,718 --> 01:05:57,185
When will it take place?

1026
01:05:57,887 --> 01:05:59,855
Sunday at 6.30 p.m.

1027
01:06:00,890 --> 01:06:02,858
Posters are given for printing.

1028
01:06:02,925 --> 01:06:04,517
It will be stuck everywhere.

1029
01:06:04,593 --> 01:06:07,187
But I hope you will not
be in problem for this?

1030
01:06:07,563 --> 01:06:09,531
I am not scared about it.

1031
01:06:09,598 --> 01:06:11,532
You still don't recognise me?

1032
01:06:12,568 --> 01:06:14,035
I know you correctly.

1033
01:06:14,236 --> 01:06:16,033
Have you come Ranu?

1034
01:06:16,238 --> 01:06:19,207
Yes father. I heard
everything from Ramen.

1035
01:06:19,909 --> 01:06:21,467
You were right.

1036
01:06:23,179 --> 01:06:26,979
I could not
recognise Haridas properly.

1037
01:06:28,851 --> 01:06:33,481
He really doesn't have courage.

1038
01:06:33,856 --> 01:06:35,824
He has no principal at all.

1039
01:06:36,192 --> 01:06:38,160
One way it's good.

1040
01:06:38,527 --> 01:06:40,154
If that article was published..

1041
01:06:40,229 --> 01:06:42,823
..your father would have
lost his hospital's job.

1042
01:06:42,898 --> 01:06:45,492
At least one public
addressing can be organised now.

1043
01:06:45,568 --> 01:06:47,502
Ranen really has done
a job like a friend.

1044
01:06:47,870 --> 01:06:49,497
My motto is only..

1045
01:06:49,572 --> 01:06:51,506
..to make people aware of it.

1046
01:06:51,574 --> 01:06:54,008
Tomorrow they are going to
publish a notice tomorrow.

1047
01:06:54,076 --> 01:06:55,509
What notice?

1048
01:06:56,212 --> 01:07:00,842
May be telling that, there is no
pollution in Chandipore's water.

1049
01:07:00,916 --> 01:07:02,178
So that people stay calm.

1050
01:07:02,251 --> 01:07:04,185
I anticipated that it
will not be published..

1051
01:07:04,253 --> 01:07:06,847
..that one will be
affected by germs..

1052
01:07:06,922 --> 01:07:09,186
..if one drinks the holy water.

1053
01:07:09,558 --> 01:07:14,518
But this is a fact that, if this
situation is hanged for some days..

1054
01:07:14,597 --> 01:07:16,531
..one thing will definitely occur.

1055
01:07:18,567 --> 01:07:20,467
That is epidemic.

1056
01:07:23,506 --> 01:07:33,472
Lecture.
Time : Sunday 1 5th Jan, 1 981.

1057
01:08:01,210 --> 01:08:03,178
So you have come!

1058
01:08:03,245 --> 01:08:05,839
Yes. I don't miss
any public meeting.

1059
01:08:06,882 --> 01:08:09,180
What is the agenda?
I saw the crowd and so I entered.

1060
01:08:09,251 --> 01:08:10,513
Don't ask me.

1061
01:08:10,719 --> 01:08:14,849
Dr.Ashok Gupta is going to say
something about Chandipore's health.

1062
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:16,516
Chandipore's health?

1063
01:08:16,592 --> 01:08:19,527
I think about the
problem of water of Chandipore.

1064
01:08:19,595 --> 01:08:21,119
It was published in the newspaper.

1065
01:08:21,197 --> 01:08:23,131
You did not read it?
- No.

1066
01:08:23,499 --> 01:08:27,128
But municipality chairman has
disagreed the matter. - That is false.

1067
01:08:27,203 --> 01:08:30,138
That's why I came
to hear the doctor.

1068
01:08:59,702 --> 01:09:02,830
My against party is also present.
Have you seen?

1069
01:09:05,207 --> 01:09:07,505
Where?
- Look at front.

1070
01:09:13,816 --> 01:09:15,443
Why are they here?

1071
01:09:16,152 --> 01:09:18,120
I invited them.

1072
01:09:20,422 --> 01:09:22,720
I really don't
understand what you do.

1073
01:09:24,093 --> 01:09:26,061
Mother, uncle is coming.

1074
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:33,068
Have you invited him also?

1075
01:09:33,435 --> 01:09:35,062
He came on his own.

1076
01:09:36,105 --> 01:09:37,732
His is a public meeting.

1077
01:09:38,107 --> 01:09:40,075
I have no right to stop anybody.

1078
01:09:49,118 --> 01:09:51,416
I will address you as a president.

1079
01:09:51,787 --> 01:09:53,414
President?

1080
01:09:54,123 --> 01:09:55,750
Well when you are here!

1081
01:09:55,824 --> 01:09:57,758
I have some problem.

1082
01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:01,760
Haridasbabu you will
accept my proposal.

1083
01:10:01,964 --> 01:10:06,424
Fine - I have something to say
prior to my brother's speech.

1084
01:10:06,502 --> 01:10:08,436
You will announce it.

1085
01:10:09,972 --> 01:10:12,440
If required
I might ask you to say something.

1086
01:10:13,142 --> 01:10:17,772
Me? - You've read brother's article.
So, you might've to give your opinion.

1087
01:10:25,821 --> 01:10:28,119
There is some conspiracy going on.

1088
01:10:29,158 --> 01:10:30,785
Something wrong.

1089
01:10:33,162 --> 01:10:34,459
Just a minute.

1090
01:10:40,502 --> 01:10:42,800
Listen!
You look after here.

1091
01:10:43,505 --> 01:10:46,804
I am fully depending on you people.

1092
01:10:46,875 --> 01:10:48,467
Understand?

1093
01:10:48,544 --> 01:10:50,478
Don't worry. We are ready.

1094
01:11:08,197 --> 01:11:10,165
Doctor can we start?

1095
01:11:11,867 --> 01:11:13,835
Well!
- Please proceed.

1096
01:11:28,984 --> 01:11:30,451
Just a second.

1097
01:11:34,156 --> 01:11:36,954
I think one president
should be selected first.

1098
01:11:37,493 --> 01:11:40,951
What for? I am going
to read a paper only.

1099
01:11:41,030 --> 01:11:42,964
You never know what
will be the reaction.

1100
01:11:43,032 --> 01:11:45,125
And on top of that, no meeting
is done without a president.

1101
01:11:45,501 --> 01:11:49,460
I propose Mr.Adhir Mukherji's name.

1102
01:11:50,005 --> 01:11:52,132
I agree to that.

1103
01:11:54,176 --> 01:11:56,144
Adhirbabu, please come.

1104
01:12:09,858 --> 01:12:13,157
Good evening friends.

1105
01:12:13,862 --> 01:12:16,490
Being the president
of today's meeting..

1106
01:12:16,565 --> 01:12:18,829
..I would like to tell
you only one thing..

1107
01:12:19,201 --> 01:12:21,601
Who are you?
Introduce yourself.

1108
01:12:22,137 --> 01:12:24,105
My name is Adhir Mukherji.

1109
01:12:24,173 --> 01:12:28,109
I am the printer and
publisher of Janabarta.

1110
01:12:28,177 --> 01:12:30,111
Oh! Fine. Continue.

1111
01:12:34,149 --> 01:12:36,447
I will tell you only one thing.

1112
01:12:37,653 --> 01:12:39,780
I am a peace loving person.

1113
01:12:40,489 --> 01:12:41,956
I would expect..

1114
01:12:42,024 --> 01:12:45,118
..a peaceful
atmosphere in today's meeting.

1115
01:12:46,495 --> 01:12:48,463
Prior to doctor Gupta's speech..

1116
01:12:48,831 --> 01:12:51,129
.. Mr.Nisit Gupta
the chairman..

1117
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:54,128
..would like to say something.

1118
01:12:54,503 --> 01:12:58,462
I request him to deliver his speech.

1119
01:13:10,519 --> 01:13:11,816
Dear friends.

1120
01:13:14,189 --> 01:13:16,157
The one who is the
speaker of today's meeting..

1121
01:13:16,225 --> 01:13:18,489
..I know him very closely.

1122
01:13:19,528 --> 01:13:21,928
I know what he wants to say.

1123
01:13:23,132 --> 01:13:25,100
I will ask you among you people,..

1124
01:13:25,467 --> 01:13:28,766
... is there anybody
who is interested to listen..

1125
01:13:28,837 --> 01:13:32,432
.. to something wrong
about Tripureswar temple?

1126
01:13:32,808 --> 01:13:37,438
We don't want to listen
anything bad about the temple.

1127
01:13:37,646 --> 01:13:40,444
No. Not at all.

1128
01:13:41,483 --> 01:13:48,446
But doctor Gupta has come here
to do so.

1129
01:13:49,491 --> 01:13:52,460
I will propose to
stop doctor Gupta..

1130
01:13:52,528 --> 01:13:54,792
..to deliver his speech.

1131
01:13:54,997 --> 01:13:58,125
We don't want to
listen to his speech.

1132
01:13:58,500 --> 01:13:59,797
What do you mean by that?

1133
01:14:04,173 --> 01:14:06,471
We want to listen to doctor Gupta.

1134
01:14:06,542 --> 01:14:09,978
Please speak out. - Why
Dr.Gupta is not allowed to speak?

1135
01:14:10,045 --> 01:14:12,980
We want to listen to Dr. Gupta.
We don't want to listen to you.

1136
01:14:13,048 --> 01:14:14,982
Order, order.

1137
01:14:19,855 --> 01:14:22,756
I think, you have seen
the municipality notice..

1138
01:14:22,825 --> 01:14:25,089
..in the newspaper.

1139
01:14:26,128 --> 01:14:28,096
Well..

1140
01:14:28,797 --> 01:14:32,426
..according to Dr.Gupta,
the temple water is polluted.

1141
01:14:32,801 --> 01:14:36,430
People are drinking
it as the holy water.

1142
01:14:36,805 --> 01:14:40,764
I am telling you
the holy water cannot be polluted.

1143
01:14:42,144 --> 01:14:45,443
Dr.Gupta is asking
to close the temple..

1144
01:14:45,514 --> 01:14:47,448
..and purify the water.

1145
01:14:48,150 --> 01:14:49,447
You say.

1146
01:14:49,518 --> 01:14:52,453
Do you agree to this proposal?

1147
01:14:52,654 --> 01:14:54,781
No.

1148
01:14:58,994 --> 01:15:03,795
Janabarta's editor is present here.

1149
01:15:05,167 --> 01:15:09,467
Dr. Gupta gave his article
to Janabarta for publication.

1150
01:15:10,839 --> 01:15:12,466
The editor quiet naturally..

1151
01:15:12,541 --> 01:15:15,135
..refused to publish the article.

1152
01:15:16,178 --> 01:15:17,805
I am requesting him..

1153
01:15:18,046 --> 01:15:20,742
..to say something about that.

1154
01:15:20,816 --> 01:15:22,750
We don't want to listen to him.

1155
01:15:22,818 --> 01:15:24,752
We came here,
to listen to the doctor.

1156
01:15:24,820 --> 01:15:26,754
Not to listen to the
editor of Janabarta.

1157
01:15:27,456 --> 01:15:28,753
Friends.

1158
01:15:33,462 --> 01:15:36,761
Earlier I believed
Dr.Gupta's statement.

1159
01:15:37,799 --> 01:15:40,927
But later, I was bound
to change my opinion.

1160
01:15:42,471 --> 01:15:43,768
I believed..

1161
01:15:44,473 --> 01:15:47,442
..that if I would have
published that article..

1162
01:15:47,509 --> 01:15:49,443
..you would deadly opposed that.

1163
01:15:50,812 --> 01:15:54,441
I was having a very good
personal relation with Dr.Gupta.

1164
01:15:55,150 --> 01:15:57,118
I had been to his place.

1165
01:15:57,185 --> 01:16:01,451
Had tea. Discussed matters.

1166
01:16:02,824 --> 01:16:06,783
I have also published
many of his articles.

1167
01:16:08,163 --> 01:16:10,791
But in the present article..

1168
01:16:10,866 --> 01:16:13,460
..what he has
written about our temple..

1169
01:16:14,836 --> 01:16:17,464
..will not be accepted by anybody.

1170
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:21,400
Being an editor of a newspaper..

1171
01:16:21,777 --> 01:16:25,076
.. I cannot deny public opinion.

1172
01:16:26,448 --> 01:16:28,416
Keeping the public opinion in mind..

1173
01:16:29,785 --> 01:16:31,753
..yes, keeping the
public opinion in mind..

1174
01:16:31,820 --> 01:16:34,084
..I refused to publish Dr.
Gupta's article.

1175
01:16:36,124 --> 01:16:38,092
My personal opinion is..

1176
01:16:39,127 --> 01:16:43,086
..whatever Dr.Gupta
has said is wrong.

1177
01:16:44,466 --> 01:16:45,433
Goodbye.

1178
01:16:55,477 --> 01:16:56,944
I request..

1179
01:16:57,145 --> 01:16:59,113
..to cast vote..

1180
01:16:59,181 --> 01:17:01,775
..on the municipality's
chairman's statement.

1181
01:17:03,151 --> 01:17:05,119
I would like to ask a question.

1182
01:17:13,161 --> 01:17:14,458
Go ahead.

1183
01:17:19,501 --> 01:17:21,059
Is this a meeting?

1184
01:17:22,104 --> 01:17:23,401
Or a comedy?

1185
01:17:24,439 --> 01:17:26,407
I have called for the meeting.

1186
01:17:26,608 --> 01:17:30,408
People came here seeing my posters
to listen to me.

1187
01:17:31,113 --> 01:17:33,081
First you listen to me.

1188
01:17:33,148 --> 01:17:35,412
And then do the judgment.

1189
01:17:36,118 --> 01:17:39,087
Let the chairman of the
municipality believe anything.

1190
01:17:39,154 --> 01:17:41,748
But why should you
believe it like that?

1191
01:17:42,457 --> 01:17:46,416
You people have come here.
You please listen to me first.

1192
01:17:46,795 --> 01:17:48,422
Allow me to say something!

1193
01:17:48,497 --> 01:17:50,431
We don't want to listen
anything wrong about the temple.

1194
01:17:50,499 --> 01:17:52,091
You keep quiet Dr.Gupta.

1195
01:17:55,804 --> 01:17:58,102
I will not stop my mouth so easily.

1196
01:17:59,141 --> 01:18:00,768
I love my town..

1197
01:18:01,143 --> 01:18:05,102
..my birthplace Chandipore by heart.

1198
01:18:05,814 --> 01:18:09,944
As a doctor I have done everything
for Chandipore's well being.

1199
01:18:10,485 --> 01:18:13,113
I am serving as a
doctor for last 26 years.

1200
01:18:13,488 --> 01:18:16,116
May be, there is
somebody in the audience..

1201
01:18:16,191 --> 01:18:18,955
..who was under my
treatment someday.

1202
01:18:19,161 --> 01:18:21,391
Yes. Dr.Gupta is a genius doctor.

1203
01:18:21,596 --> 01:18:25,396
He recovered me from deathbed.
I am ever grateful to him.

1204
01:18:25,767 --> 01:18:27,394
Thank you very much.

1205
01:18:28,437 --> 01:18:29,734
I am telling you..

1206
01:18:30,439 --> 01:18:35,741
..that Chandipore's water and
climate was very healthy earlier.

1207
01:18:36,111 --> 01:18:38,079
But now it is no more like that.

1208
01:18:38,447 --> 01:18:42,747
I have a strong evidence of it.
And I want to tell you about this.

1209
01:18:43,952 --> 01:18:46,921
So that the bad days don't come.

1210
01:18:47,122 --> 01:18:52,082
Chandipore can come back
to its earlier position.

1211
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:54,754
But you have to know how.
Otherwise how will you understand?

1212
01:18:54,830 --> 01:18:58,766
I want to tell you that.
Tell me, do you want to listen to it?

1213
01:18:58,967 --> 01:19:00,764
Yes, we want to listen.

1214
01:19:00,836 --> 01:19:03,771
You please proceed.
We want to hear.

1215
01:19:31,433 --> 01:19:32,730
Dear friends.

1216
01:19:34,102 --> 01:19:37,071
Today I have come to say..

1217
01:19:37,139 --> 01:19:38,401
Mr. President..

1218
01:19:39,941 --> 01:19:45,402
..I would like to ask
something to doctor. - Go ahead.

1219
01:19:53,955 --> 01:19:56,753
Do you believe
yourself to be a Hindu?

1220
01:19:56,825 --> 01:19:58,417
Why such a question?

1221
01:19:58,493 --> 01:20:00,427
There is some reason.
Please answer me.

1222
01:20:01,129 --> 01:20:04,758
My reply is, I believe to
be a Hindu for 1 00 times.

1223
01:20:04,833 --> 01:20:06,425
There is no doubt about it.

1224
01:20:06,968 --> 01:20:09,436
Have you visited
Tripureswar temple..

1225
01:20:09,504 --> 01:20:14,100
..in last 1 0 years? - The way
you are meaning, I did not go.

1226
01:20:14,176 --> 01:20:16,940
So, you did not go for worshipping
- No.

1227
01:20:17,479 --> 01:20:20,107
Why? You don't
believe all these rituals?

1228
01:20:22,150 --> 01:20:25,119
I will tell you the truth.

1229
01:20:26,154 --> 01:20:29,453
I don't believe
in some Hindu rites and rituals.

1230
01:20:29,825 --> 01:20:34,455
Because science has
shown me another path.

1231
01:20:34,996 --> 01:20:36,964
But this is a private matter.

1232
01:20:37,499 --> 01:20:39,467
The one who goes..

1233
01:20:39,534 --> 01:20:41,126
..offer prayers..

1234
01:20:41,203 --> 01:20:42,795
..drinks the holy water..

1235
01:20:42,871 --> 01:20:44,805
.. I don't want to
hurt on their belief.

1236
01:20:45,507 --> 01:20:49,466
Too much of germs is found
in the temple's water.

1237
01:20:49,544 --> 01:20:55,483
So I say it's dangerous to drink that
water, the holy water of the temple.

1238
01:20:55,851 --> 01:20:58,820
This is not a question of religion,
but of health.

1239
01:20:59,521 --> 01:21:04,151
I say that this water should
be purified immediately.

1240
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:07,829
Worship will continue as it is.

1241
01:21:11,533 --> 01:21:14,832
How many do drink
the holy water daily?

1242
01:21:15,537 --> 01:21:17,505
Do you have any idea about it?

1243
01:21:18,206 --> 01:21:24,441
Well, seeing the crowd,
I can assume as 1 000 approx.

1244
01:21:24,646 --> 01:21:29,606
How many cases you found
caused by the polluted water?

1245
01:21:29,684 --> 01:21:31,447
No, no. That is not
the way of measurement.

1246
01:21:31,519 --> 01:21:33,783
And I'm not the only doctor here.
There are many other doctors too.

1247
01:21:33,855 --> 01:21:35,447
You reply me.

1248
01:21:36,157 --> 01:21:38,785
I have attended in last 1 5 days..

1249
01:21:38,994 --> 01:21:40,962
..about 1 50 patients.

1250
01:21:41,029 --> 01:21:42,963
Some of them died too.

1251
01:21:43,031 --> 01:21:44,464
I am talking about my patients.

1252
01:21:44,532 --> 01:21:47,467
And I must discuss about
other doctor's cases too.

1253
01:21:49,504 --> 01:21:52,803
In total it might come up to 500.

1254
01:21:52,874 --> 01:21:54,808
Yes, certainly.

1255
01:21:54,876 --> 01:21:59,973
That means, in 1 5 days
1 5000 people had the holy water.

1256
01:22:00,515 --> 01:22:03,484
And the number of patients is 500.

1257
01:22:04,185 --> 01:22:08,144
Do you still believe germs
is affecting that people...

1258
01:22:08,223 --> 01:22:09,986
... after drinking the holy water?

1259
01:22:10,058 --> 01:22:15,826
No, no.
We don't believe it. No, no.

1260
01:22:33,481 --> 01:22:35,779
Dr.Gupta, let us move.

1261
01:22:35,850 --> 01:22:37,442
Let's go.

1262
01:23:03,511 --> 01:23:11,816
Enemy of the people
Recognize Dr.Ashok Gupta

1263
01:23:33,008 --> 01:23:34,976
You will not be able to go outside.

1264
01:23:36,344 --> 01:23:38,312
How can you stay here like this?

1265
01:23:40,348 --> 01:23:43,647
Shall I run away!
- Or else what will you do?

1266
01:23:45,020 --> 01:23:50,322
But what will happen
with that polluted water?

1267
01:23:52,360 --> 01:23:54,328
To my patients?

1268
01:23:56,031 --> 01:24:01,333
At such a crisis period,
shall I run away?

1269
01:24:02,370 --> 01:24:04,668
They will not let you stay here.

1270
01:24:05,874 --> 01:24:09,002
I can understand Maya.

1271
01:24:10,378 --> 01:24:15,008
But I haven't done anything wrong.
Why this will happen to me?

1272
01:24:16,384 --> 01:24:20,616
Will they not realise
what a big mistake they are doing?

1273
01:24:21,823 --> 01:24:23,290
May I come in?

1274
01:24:24,993 --> 01:24:26,290
Please come.

1275
01:24:27,328 --> 01:24:28,625
Please be sited.

1276
01:24:30,331 --> 01:24:33,300
I am sorry for the
demurrage of your house.

1277
01:24:35,003 --> 01:24:38,632
That's not your fault.
It is the hired criminal's job.

1278
01:24:39,007 --> 01:24:41,976
I know.
Tell me, what is the matter?

1279
01:24:44,012 --> 01:24:47,971
I am really sorry to say.
But..

1280
01:24:50,351 --> 01:24:52,319
Let me make it easier for you.

1281
01:24:53,354 --> 01:24:55,982
You are telling us to
leave this locality.

1282
01:24:56,858 --> 01:24:57,984
Isn't it?

1283
01:24:58,359 --> 01:25:00,327
I can't tell it on my own.

1284
01:25:00,695 --> 01:25:02,322
You know me well.

1285
01:25:02,697 --> 01:25:04,995
You are my tenant for last 5 years.

1286
01:25:05,366 --> 01:25:10,668
Truly speaking, I don't feel
like addressing you as my tenant.

1287
01:25:11,372 --> 01:25:15,001
Because the relation
between us is not like that.

1288
01:25:16,044 --> 01:25:18,672
I never had any dispute with you.

1289
01:25:20,048 --> 01:25:23,950
You cured my daughter.

1290
01:25:24,652 --> 01:25:26,779
I am ever grateful to you.

1291
01:25:26,988 --> 01:25:30,947
But
- Speak out.

1292
01:25:31,326 --> 01:25:34,625
The neighbours have
almost arrested me.

1293
01:25:34,996 --> 01:25:36,964
They don't want that you
stay at this locality.

1294
01:25:37,332 --> 01:25:39,630
I have come here to
talk about them only.

1295
01:25:40,835 --> 01:25:42,803
I am helpless doctor.

1296
01:25:43,004 --> 01:25:45,973
Even I cannot say
anything on your favour.

1297
01:25:48,009 --> 01:25:49,977
So, this is the fact?
- Oh yes.

1298
01:25:52,347 --> 01:25:53,644
Ok.

1299
01:25:55,016 --> 01:25:56,984
I cannot shift immediately.

1300
01:25:57,685 --> 01:26:01,314
Let me check for few more days.
Then I will decide.

1301
01:26:02,357 --> 01:26:04,325
Please forgive me doctor.

1302
01:26:04,692 --> 01:26:08,992
I am really
pressurised to come here.

1303
01:26:10,031 --> 01:26:12,829
My opinion about you
is not at all changed.

1304
01:26:13,034 --> 01:26:14,831
Let the people speak anything.

1305
01:26:15,370 --> 01:26:17,338
I can understand your position.

1306
01:26:18,039 --> 01:26:20,769
Now shall I make a move?
- Yes.

1307
01:26:29,484 --> 01:26:32,942
You returned so fast.
What happened?

1308
01:26:33,021 --> 01:26:34,955
I am telling you the fact.

1309
01:26:36,324 --> 01:26:38,622
Ranu is sacked from her school.

1310
01:26:39,994 --> 01:26:46,627
Because he is the daughter
of Dr.Ashok Gupta. Isn't it?

1311
01:26:46,701 --> 01:26:47,633
Yes.

1312
01:26:48,336 --> 01:26:50,304
You have lost your job!

1313
01:26:52,340 --> 01:26:55,309
5 guardians have
submitted letters against me..

1314
01:26:55,510 --> 01:26:57,637
..telling not to keep
me there as a teacher.

1315
01:26:59,347 --> 01:27:01,474
Kamala told me personally.

1316
01:27:01,683 --> 01:27:03,310
But she loves you so much.

1317
01:27:03,685 --> 01:27:05,653
Even she was feeling bad for it.

1318
01:27:06,354 --> 01:27:07,651
But what to do?

1319
01:27:08,690 --> 01:27:11,659
It is the authority's discretion.

1320
01:27:13,027 --> 01:27:15,325
And moreover, not job
was not confirmed yet.

1321
01:27:26,774 --> 01:27:29,572
Hello!
- I am Nisit here.

1322
01:27:29,944 --> 01:27:34,574
Good morning! I don't think
I have still the hospital job.

1323
01:27:34,949 --> 01:27:38,248
Committee has given a
show cause notice to you.

1324
01:27:38,786 --> 01:27:41,755
If you are unable to give a
satisfactory reply, then..

1325
01:27:42,624 --> 01:27:43,921
Thanks.

1326
01:27:44,292 --> 01:27:46,260
But there is a way out.
- What is it?

1327
01:27:46,794 --> 01:27:48,762
If you surrender
that you have mistake..

1328
01:27:48,830 --> 01:27:50,263
..then you will get the job back.

1329
01:27:50,632 --> 01:27:52,600
You know it very well..

1330
01:27:53,301 --> 01:27:56,270
..that I will not tell
that I have done wrong.

1331
01:27:56,337 --> 01:27:59,773
In that case, this will go on.
- Ok.

1332
01:28:07,315 --> 01:28:08,612
What is it?

1333
01:28:11,819 --> 01:28:13,616
There is a proposal.

1334
01:28:13,821 --> 01:28:17,279
You will be established
once more if you follow it.

1335
01:28:17,492 --> 01:28:18,618
Get out.

1336
01:28:20,261 --> 01:28:22,229
I say, get out at once.

1337
01:28:22,764 --> 01:28:24,732
Otherwise I will draw you out.

1338
01:28:53,294 --> 01:28:54,921
What's the matter?

1339
01:29:02,970 --> 01:29:04,597
I have lost.

1340
01:29:11,312 --> 01:29:13,610
I no more have that
revolutionary power.

1341
01:29:18,653 --> 01:29:21,554
Was that brother-in-laws call?

1342
01:29:25,259 --> 01:29:26,886
Your job?

1343
01:29:37,939 --> 01:29:40,908
Rangayan!
- Yes sir.

1344
01:29:42,276 --> 01:29:45,245
Say to the visitor that
he cannot meet the doctor.

1345
01:29:45,446 --> 01:29:47,914
Ranen is expected.

1346
01:29:48,282 --> 01:29:50,409
He has some work with you.

1347
01:29:51,619 --> 01:29:55,248
I see.
If it is Ranen, then allow him.

1348
01:30:11,305 --> 01:30:13,273
Because of this unfortunate man..

1349
01:30:14,308 --> 01:30:16,606
..you all are ruined Ranu.

1350
01:30:19,313 --> 01:30:21,781
I don't know how to console you.

1351
01:30:24,318 --> 01:30:26,616
Why are you so disappointed father?

1352
01:30:26,988 --> 01:30:28,956
You have your private practice.

1353
01:30:29,323 --> 01:30:32,292
And how many doctors can you
find in Chandipore of your standard?

1354
01:30:32,994 --> 01:30:36,293
And if required, I will
take up couple of tuitions.

1355
01:30:36,364 --> 01:30:37,956
Can't we run the family on that?

1356
01:30:38,032 --> 01:30:40,967
What's wrong? Are you sick?

1357
01:30:43,004 --> 01:30:45,632
How can I stay fit..

1358
01:30:47,341 --> 01:30:49,309
..in a situation like this?

1359
01:30:51,345 --> 01:30:53,313
Bireshbabu called me up.

1360
01:30:56,017 --> 01:30:57,985
He has some work with you.

1361
01:30:59,353 --> 01:31:01,321
He hesitated to come alone.

1362
01:31:02,023 --> 01:31:04,992
Your editor came
here few minutes ago.

1363
01:31:06,360 --> 01:31:08,328
I drew them out.

1364
01:31:10,865 --> 01:31:12,833
He is not my editor.

1365
01:31:13,367 --> 01:31:15,335
I am not in Janabarta anymore.

1366
01:31:16,370 --> 01:31:17,337
What?

1367
01:31:17,705 --> 01:31:21,607
Yes. I am a freelancer, happy.

1368
01:31:22,310 --> 01:31:26,770
Really. Please come in.
Let me listen to the fact.

1369
01:31:33,821 --> 01:31:41,284
Doctor, I could not tolerate
what Janabarta did with you.

1370
01:31:42,330 --> 01:31:45,959
And the incident happened in the
yesterday meeting was really worse.

1371
01:31:47,001 --> 01:31:51,631
I want to send a report of this
meeting to all the papers of Calcutta.

1372
01:31:52,340 --> 01:31:54,638
Along with your interview..

1373
01:31:54,709 --> 01:31:57,974
..where you will express
yourself deliberately.

1374
01:31:59,680 --> 01:32:02,649
Well! That's a real good news.

1375
01:32:03,017 --> 01:32:05,315
I wanted this only.
I wanted to make people aware..

1376
01:32:05,386 --> 01:32:07,320
..of the fact and
then let them judge.

1377
01:32:07,388 --> 01:32:09,322
Maya, please arrange for some tea.

1378
01:32:11,359 --> 01:32:13,327
I have no objection
to give an interview.

1379
01:32:13,394 --> 01:32:17,660
But give the byline as a
statement from a villain (Ganashatru).

1380
01:32:17,865 --> 01:32:19,833
Have you seen what
they have written outside?

1381
01:32:20,034 --> 01:32:24,596
Doctor, I want to talk to you
before you give the interview.

1382
01:32:25,973 --> 01:32:27,941
If you kindly do the proof by today.

1383
01:32:29,977 --> 01:32:32,275
What is it?
- Your article. The one...

1384
01:32:32,346 --> 01:32:34,280
..which was not
published in Janabarta.

1385
01:32:34,982 --> 01:32:36,779
Ranu kept a copy of it.

1386
01:32:36,851 --> 01:32:39,786
Which she gave me. We are
publishing it as a pamphlet.

1387
01:32:39,987 --> 01:32:41,955
It will be distributed
in each and every house.

1388
01:32:43,324 --> 01:32:47,624
That's great!
There is still hope.

1389
01:32:47,695 --> 01:32:48,957
Certainly.

1390
01:32:49,030 --> 01:32:51,294
A public meeting will be
organised in the temple.

1391
01:32:51,365 --> 01:32:54,801
We will continue your
campaign till they realise.

1392
01:32:55,002 --> 01:32:56,629
I was thinking that..

1393
01:32:56,704 --> 01:33:02,643
..I have lost my sore. I don't know
how long I can stay here..

1394
01:33:02,843 --> 01:33:05,641
..Ranu has lost her job,
my job..

1395
01:33:09,350 --> 01:33:21,251
Long live Ashok Gupta!
- Long live!

1396
01:33:23,297 --> 01:33:24,924
What is happening?

1397
01:33:25,299 --> 01:33:27,267
They all are coming to meet you.

1398
01:33:28,302 --> 01:33:29,929
Who are they?

1399
01:33:30,304 --> 01:33:33,933
My theatre group and many
literate youths of Chandipore.

1400
01:33:34,308 --> 01:33:36,276
Yesterday night they
organised a meeting.

1401
01:33:36,677 --> 01:33:38,611
Today they are
coming to tell you that..

1402
01:33:38,679 --> 01:33:40,271
..they all are with you.

1403
01:33:41,315 --> 01:33:42,942
Unbelievable!

1404
01:33:44,318 --> 01:33:46,286
Long live Ashok Gupta?!

1405
01:33:48,322 --> 01:33:53,282
Long live Ashok Gupta!

1406
01:33:55,329 --> 01:33:56,796
Who are they?

1407
01:33:58,032 --> 01:34:01,331
I am not alone Maya.
I am not alone.

1408
01:34:02,536 --> 01:34:06,996
I might be a villain.
But I have many friends.

1409
01:34:07,541 --> 01:34:10,840
We are going to stay back here.
This is my work place.

1410
01:34:11,212 --> 01:34:21,087
Long live Ashok Gupta!
Long live.. Iong live..

1411
01:34:22,305 --> 01:35:22,851
