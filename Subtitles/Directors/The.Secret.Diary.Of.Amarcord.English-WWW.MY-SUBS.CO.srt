00:00:38,248 --> 00:00:43,795
SECRET DIARY OF AMARCORD

2
00:00:45,255 --> 00:00:51,553
WRITTEN AND DIRECTED
BY FELLINI'S COLLABORATORS

3
00:01:12,407 --> 00:01:14,701
Do you have fog in China?

4
00:01:14,784 --> 00:01:18,872
Yes, we have fog, snow, rain. Everything!

5
00:01:23,501 --> 00:01:25,628
Is it yellow,
or is it gray like it is here?

6
00:01:26,129 --> 00:01:29,174
Gray! Everything's similar to here.

7
00:01:33,887 --> 00:01:35,805
I'm not sure you're being truthful.

8
00:01:36,723 --> 00:01:40,268
Who knows what kind of stuff
happens in China?

9
00:01:40,852 --> 00:01:42,896
Maybe you don't want to tell me.

10
00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:45,440
I tell everything. You ask, I tell!

11
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:48,777
For example...

12
00:01:50,403 --> 00:01:53,698
are Chinese children born
after nine months or earlier?

13
00:01:53,782 --> 00:01:56,409
- Nine months!
- Take it easy.

14
00:01:56,493 --> 00:01:58,828
Think carefully before you answer.

15
00:01:59,704 --> 00:02:04,083
I read in a book that you Chinese
are so small because you are born early.

16
00:02:04,167 --> 00:02:05,168
Is it true?

17
00:02:05,877 --> 00:02:07,921
It's wrong! The book is wrong!

18
00:02:08,004 --> 00:02:09,964
No, it's not wrong.

19
00:02:10,465 --> 00:02:14,969
It's a book that describes
all the differences between you and us.

20
00:02:16,221 --> 00:02:19,349
- For example, straight and curly hair.
- That's true!

21
00:02:20,058 --> 00:02:22,519
You have almond-shaped eyes,
while we don't.

22
00:02:23,102 --> 00:02:24,687
- Isn't it true?
- It's obvious.

23
00:02:25,271 --> 00:02:28,900
Your skin is yellow, like shit.
Ours is white.

24
00:02:29,359 --> 00:02:30,360
True!

25
00:02:31,903 --> 00:02:34,864
You have no belly button,
while we have one.

26
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:37,283
We have a belly button too!

27
00:02:37,742 --> 00:02:39,285
- That's not true!
- Yes it is!

28
00:02:39,619 --> 00:02:42,664
- You're a liar!
- No, we have a belly button!

29
00:02:42,747 --> 00:02:45,166
- Did you hear that? He says he has it!
- No, he doesn't.

30
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:48,253
- It's true!
- I'm coming to check it out.

31
00:02:48,336 --> 00:02:51,130
- Show me! Take this stuff off!
- We all have one!

32
00:02:51,214 --> 00:02:54,801
We're not going to be fooled
by someone like you! Right, guys?

33
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:57,720
- That's it.
- What are you doing?

34
00:02:58,638 --> 00:03:03,434
- No, not the trousers!
- No? Then he hasn't got one!

35
00:03:04,686 --> 00:03:07,939
- I do!
- Show me, if you do!

36
00:03:08,022 --> 00:03:11,401
- No! Not here -
- Here we go, show me. Come on!

37
00:03:11,484 --> 00:03:15,613
Come on, show me there's nothing here.

38
00:03:18,116 --> 00:03:20,243
He has one! I have to admit it.

39
00:03:20,326 --> 00:03:23,329
Okay, I get it.
This scene isn't in the film. I cut it.

40
00:03:23,413 --> 00:03:26,416
What do you want to do with it?
Why did you retrieve it from the bin?

41
00:03:26,499 --> 00:03:32,463
That's it. We were planning on using
the deleted scenes of the film,

42
00:03:32,547 --> 00:03:37,844
and even duplicates
and discarded takes from the editing bin,

43
00:03:37,927 --> 00:03:44,851
plus the journalistic material
shot by Peppino Rotunno during production,

44
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:50,481
to create a sort of secret diary,
a kind of conversation.

45
00:03:50,565 --> 00:03:53,735
What is it you're aiming to narrate?
What's the point of view?

46
00:03:53,818 --> 00:03:57,447
The point of view of your collaborators,
like your first assistant, Maurizio,

47
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:00,074
the editing secretary, Norma. Gerard.

48
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:03,995
- It looks like the usual stuff to me.
- Not exactly.

49
00:04:04,078 --> 00:04:09,375
We chose your relationship with actors
as our main theme. That hasn't been done.

50
00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:15,006
The way you abuse actors,
your relationship with them when shooting.

51
00:04:15,632 --> 00:04:19,594
Plus the relationship with their parents,
spouses, relatives, the police.

52
00:04:20,094 --> 00:04:24,057
Maurizio had a lovely idea.
He'd like to start with the offices.

53
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:27,977
Yes, I thought I'd reproduce
the exaggerated, exasperated atmosphere -.

54
00:04:28,061 --> 00:04:30,813
Who would be making this stuff?

55
00:04:30,897 --> 00:04:33,775
I don't know. Maurizio will shoot.
I've made a schedule.

56
00:04:33,858 --> 00:04:35,485
- The two of you?
- Yes.

57
00:04:36,235 --> 00:04:37,278
Yes.

58
00:04:37,654 --> 00:04:40,448
Cinzia, baby, you're two meters tall!

59
00:04:40,531 --> 00:04:43,284
Are you still here? Good morning, man.

60
00:04:43,368 --> 00:04:44,452
Later.

61
00:04:44,535 --> 00:04:46,162
Yes, wait five minutes.

62
00:04:46,245 --> 00:04:49,916
- I'll wait over there.
- Please, I've been waiting for two hours.

63
00:04:49,999 --> 00:04:53,294
So what?
Liliana, I want to see Nandino Orfei.

64
00:04:53,378 --> 00:04:55,880
Call the circus back.
It's the fifth time I've told you!

65
00:04:55,964 --> 00:04:59,092
- Have you found the dwarf?
- I don't know.

66
00:04:59,175 --> 00:05:03,388
- You don't know?
- I brought the singer Masella. Say hello.

67
00:05:03,471 --> 00:05:07,392
- Good morning, dottore.
- The dottore here wanted to see you again.

68
00:05:07,475 --> 00:05:10,061
Are you an actress, ma'am?
Have you ever worked in cinema?

69
00:05:10,144 --> 00:05:13,231
No, I worked in television, in Bari.

70
00:05:13,314 --> 00:05:15,984
- Excuse me, Maurizio.
- Hello?

71
00:05:16,067 --> 00:05:18,319
- Yes, one second. Norma?
- Yes?

72
00:05:18,403 --> 00:05:22,407
- It's the agent of that English singer!
- Masella has a bachelor party at 2:00.

73
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:23,992
What was your role in TV?

74
00:05:24,075 --> 00:05:27,161
- His train leaves at 11:00 a.m.
- But I'm talking to the lady here!

75
00:05:27,245 --> 00:05:31,040
I don't know.
I worked on human expressions.

76
00:05:31,582 --> 00:05:33,543
They would say, "Ms. Martina."

77
00:05:33,626 --> 00:05:36,462
That was my maiden name.
My married name is Gambetta.

78
00:05:36,546 --> 00:05:40,341
They would say, "Happy. Worried."

79
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,553
I can't remember
what else they used to say. Ah, yes!

80
00:05:44,387 --> 00:05:47,348
This expression, for example,
is atrocious pain.

81
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:50,893
- Or -
- Why do you bring me these people?

82
00:05:50,977 --> 00:05:54,313
I didn't bring her here.
I'm with Masella, who has to leave!

83
00:05:54,397 --> 00:05:57,567
Dottore, I have a show
in Naples at 2:00 p.m.

84
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:01,029
I can pull off any expression
needed in art!

85
00:06:12,081 --> 00:06:14,292
- Maurizio?
- Yes, dottor Fellini?

86
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:18,254
- What about that Poiletto?
- Poiletti, yes.

87
00:06:18,337 --> 00:06:21,132
- Yes, that guy. Did you find him?
- He's dead.

88
00:06:21,883 --> 00:06:25,344
- He's dead?
- Yes, I spoke to his widow. He's dead.

89
00:06:25,428 --> 00:06:27,638
I can't believe it!
One guy's dead, one's in jail,

90
00:06:27,722 --> 00:06:29,599
one's changed gender, one's in Chile!

91
00:06:29,682 --> 00:06:32,185
I want to see Poiletto!

92
00:06:32,268 --> 00:06:33,811
Find him! That's your job!

93
00:06:35,271 --> 00:06:36,355
Okay.

94
00:06:37,482 --> 00:06:39,817
Another thing, dottore.

95
00:06:39,901 --> 00:06:41,527
I can knit.

96
00:06:41,611 --> 00:06:44,280
Scarves, vests, pullovers.

97
00:06:44,363 --> 00:06:46,741
I can make some for you and your wife.

98
00:06:47,158 --> 00:06:48,951
- Come here, Gerard!
- Who is it?

99
00:06:49,452 --> 00:06:52,205
I think it's the embassy.
About that French actor.

100
00:06:52,538 --> 00:06:54,207
...by 15%...

101
00:06:57,251 --> 00:06:59,253
Norma, I can't hear a thing!

102
00:07:02,298 --> 00:07:07,178
I need you when I sleep
I wake and you're not there

103
00:07:07,929 --> 00:07:10,890
Norma! Shut up in there!

104
00:07:14,769 --> 00:07:16,521
What's going on in here?

105
00:07:16,604 --> 00:07:19,232
This is an office! Get out!

106
00:07:19,315 --> 00:07:22,443
Do I have to tell it to you again?
Don't let anyone in here!

107
00:07:22,527 --> 00:07:25,780
...journalist,
you're a real smoocher too, you know?

108
00:07:25,863 --> 00:07:28,658
- Good morning, what's the fee?
- For what?

109
00:07:29,117 --> 00:07:32,995
- I was asking what the fee is.
- Are you asking if we'll pay you?

110
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:37,333
- No, if I owe you anything.
- What? If you have to pay us?

111
00:07:37,917 --> 00:07:40,753
Yes, it wouldn't be the first time.

112
00:07:40,837 --> 00:07:46,134
Once, I left a photograph
and then received a bill for 5,000 lire.

113
00:07:47,135 --> 00:07:48,594
Good morning.

114
00:07:52,431 --> 00:07:54,517
Good morning, ma'am. Are you an actress?

115
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,352
No, I'm not.

116
00:07:56,435 --> 00:08:01,232
- Were you invited here?
- No, I wasn't.

117
00:08:01,315 --> 00:08:03,693
- I wasn't invited.
- No?

118
00:08:03,776 --> 00:08:07,530
Would you like to play a part in the film?
Is that what you want?

119
00:08:08,281 --> 00:08:10,575
No, I don't want to do anything
regarding the film.

120
00:08:10,658 --> 00:08:12,076
So what are you doing here?

121
00:08:12,493 --> 00:08:14,704
I'd like to finally see the monster!

122
00:08:14,787 --> 00:08:16,038
What monster?

123
00:08:16,122 --> 00:08:18,374
Mr. Fellini!

124
00:08:19,167 --> 00:08:20,793
One second.

125
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,629
Well?

126
00:08:26,674 --> 00:08:28,885
- There are three types of drunkards.
- Really?

127
00:08:28,968 --> 00:08:32,763
The drunk, the very drunk
and the incredibly drunk!

128
00:08:32,847 --> 00:08:36,809
- He's moved. Where can I look?
- Try again! Find him!

129
00:08:36,893 --> 00:08:42,398
- There's a substantial difference.
- The pics of the Viterbo pharmacist?

130
00:08:42,481 --> 00:08:45,985
- He wants to see them. They're not here!
- Let me show you.

131
00:08:46,068 --> 00:08:49,530
- What's that?
- The drunk.

132
00:08:50,823 --> 00:08:52,950
Next is the very drunk.

133
00:08:54,827 --> 00:08:56,829
What are you doing? What's that?

134
00:08:57,205 --> 00:08:58,623
The very drunk.

135
00:08:59,332 --> 00:09:01,667
And finally,
there's the guy who devastates himself.

136
00:09:04,795 --> 00:09:06,672
- Good morning, dottore.
- Who are you?

137
00:09:07,131 --> 00:09:11,010
- I am easily moved, dottore.
- What?

138
00:09:21,437 --> 00:09:24,565
Well done. How does it come so easy?

139
00:09:25,066 --> 00:09:27,777
- Have you always been moved easily?
- It happens immediately.

140
00:09:29,195 --> 00:09:30,696
It's a vocation, then.

141
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:49,340
You're really good.

142
00:09:49,924 --> 00:09:53,469
However, there's nothing for you
in this film. Maybe another time. Bye.

143
00:09:54,804 --> 00:09:57,265
Our offices aren't always this chaotic.

144
00:09:57,348 --> 00:10:00,142
- There are also calm, peaceful times.
- Maurizio?

145
00:10:00,226 --> 00:10:02,019
Here I come, dottor Fellini!

146
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:05,773
Now, for example, while we check
the scene budget,

147
00:10:05,856 --> 00:10:08,818
Gerard is speaking
to a structuralist critic from Positif.

148
00:10:08,901 --> 00:10:10,194
- Meanwhile I -
- Maurizio!

149
00:10:10,278 --> 00:10:11,279
Yes?

150
00:10:11,362 --> 00:10:13,281
He's called me 30 times!

151
00:10:15,408 --> 00:10:18,119
Where were you, Maurizio?

152
00:10:18,202 --> 00:10:19,787
Sit here.

153
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,831
I was drawing Volpina.

154
00:10:21,914 --> 00:10:24,917
She'll have a green dress with black spots

155
00:10:25,001 --> 00:10:26,585
so she'll look like a lizard.

156
00:10:26,669 --> 00:10:30,006
But she's a cat. You know what I mean?

157
00:10:30,089 --> 00:10:32,216
There you go. That's what I want.

158
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:36,679
A cat. With a wild, stray side to her.

159
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:41,517
An animal that's always ready to strike,
yet always escaping.

160
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,895
- What's up?
- That German journalist is here.

161
00:10:44,979 --> 00:10:48,357
- Tonino Guerra should be translating.
- He's not here yet.

162
00:10:48,441 --> 00:10:50,901
I was telling Maurizio.
There's no use in you searching,

163
00:10:50,985 --> 00:10:53,696
if you don't really know what I want,
how the characters are.

164
00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:55,364
What are you looking for?

165
00:10:55,448 --> 00:10:58,576
Volpina must be a cat. I want a cat!

166
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:00,870
Yes, Liliana. We need to think about cats.

167
00:11:00,953 --> 00:11:02,038
Of course, a cat.

168
00:11:02,413 --> 00:11:03,414
That's it.

169
00:11:12,256 --> 00:11:16,886
As you heard, Fellini was imperative.
Volpina must be a cat.

170
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:29,398
For days, famous and unknown actresses
surrendered to his requests.

171
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:32,818
They agreed to have
their faces painted white.

172
00:11:32,902 --> 00:11:34,278
To wear false glass eyes.

173
00:11:34,362 --> 00:11:36,822
To bear horrid false scars on their faces.

174
00:11:54,173 --> 00:11:58,177
It must however be said that our director
practices this aberrant search,

175
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,679
these experiments
worthy of Dr. Frankenstein,

176
00:12:00,763 --> 00:12:01,889
only during the casting.

177
00:12:04,934 --> 00:12:08,312
All that's left in the film
is the clear-cut and precise character.

178
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:39,135
We're in makeup artist
Rino Carboni's workshop.

179
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:44,181
Carboni, what exactly is makeup
in a film by Fellini?

180
00:12:44,265 --> 00:12:50,187
In Fellini's films, makeup is never
conventional preparation of actors.

181
00:12:50,521 --> 00:12:53,816
It's above all and almost always
a violent operation,

182
00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:59,321
a radical intervention aiming
not at simple and banal transformation...

183
00:13:00,448 --> 00:13:03,826
but the exasperated specification
of a face, of a personality.

184
00:13:03,909 --> 00:13:05,870
He simply expects the makeup department

185
00:13:05,953 --> 00:13:08,747
to immediately become
a dermatology center,

186
00:13:08,831 --> 00:13:12,001
an operating theater, a taxidermy studio.

187
00:13:12,084 --> 00:13:13,836
So he'll ask you the weirdest things.

188
00:13:14,462 --> 00:13:18,632
He asks you to change the eye colors
or nose shapes of the actors.

189
00:13:18,716 --> 00:13:21,802
To enlarge or remove a character's teeth,

190
00:13:21,886 --> 00:13:24,430
to extend chins or make people fatter,

191
00:13:24,513 --> 00:13:29,351
Fellini considers actors
to be extendable and dilatable.

192
00:13:29,768 --> 00:13:31,145
He demands all sorts of things.

193
00:13:31,228 --> 00:13:37,735
To cut hands, arms, teeth, feet, breasts
in the case of hermaphrodites, and so on.

194
00:14:12,686 --> 00:14:18,275
Magali Noël is the actress who played
the character of Gradisca in the film.

195
00:14:19,902 --> 00:14:23,739
How many candidates did Fellini examine,
before choosing her?

196
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:40,089
The search for Gradisca was long,
meticulous, draining and utterly useless.

197
00:14:40,798 --> 00:14:43,384
That's right. Gradisca was
supposed to be Sandra Milo,

198
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:47,221
and she would have been in the film too,
had things gone differently.

199
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,644
At this point, someone may ask,

200
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:55,854
"If Sandrocchia was always meant
to be Gradisca,

201
00:14:55,938 --> 00:15:00,484
why were such exhausting searches
performed all over Emilia Romagna?

202
00:15:00,568 --> 00:15:04,321
Why were hundreds of candidates
invited to try out for the part?"

203
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:07,032
Perhaps because in Fellini,
a call for actors

204
00:15:07,116 --> 00:15:09,827
is above all a psychological state,

205
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:13,998
allowing him to gradually define
characters more deeply and precisely.

206
00:15:35,102 --> 00:15:38,897
As you may know,
Sandra Milo didn't work on the film.

207
00:15:59,543 --> 00:16:03,589
Therefore, we chose to visit her
and have a chat.

208
00:16:04,256 --> 00:16:08,927
Early one morning,
we waited in front of her kids' school.

209
00:16:09,011 --> 00:16:12,681
And setting aside the discomfort
of this rather theatrical ambush,

210
00:16:12,765 --> 00:16:13,932
we kidnapped her.

211
00:16:14,016 --> 00:16:16,518
- Come with us.
- Where are you taking me?

212
00:16:29,865 --> 00:16:31,784
Can we start, ma'am?

213
00:16:32,743 --> 00:16:33,994
Okay.

214
00:16:35,162 --> 00:16:37,706
I warn you, I'm terrible at interviews.

215
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:44,171
You chose not to play Gradisca, right?

216
00:16:44,254 --> 00:16:47,508
You had your own objective reasons.

217
00:16:48,175 --> 00:16:50,260
Surely you're sad
not to have been in the film.

218
00:16:50,344 --> 00:16:54,181
However, your choice also makes you free,

219
00:16:54,264 --> 00:16:57,434
more independent from that character.

220
00:16:57,518 --> 00:17:00,688
You're free to talk about her.

221
00:17:01,438 --> 00:17:07,486
I'm not all that free,
as in the end I didn't play Gradisca,

222
00:17:08,529 --> 00:17:15,411
and Gradisca is such a great character,
like all of Fellini's characters, and -.

223
00:17:16,245 --> 00:17:21,458
I'm personally not a great fan
of Magali Noël.

224
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:24,420
As you were saying -.

225
00:17:24,503 --> 00:17:30,259
But I'm not saying that
out of jealousy, right?

226
00:17:30,342 --> 00:17:34,805
- Of course.
- It's just that how I envisioned her...

227
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:40,602
I think I would have portrayed her
with a little more joy,

228
00:17:41,186 --> 00:17:46,066
and even a little more innocence,
if you will.

229
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:51,822
That's it. Based on descriptions,
I had imagined her...

230
00:17:52,823 --> 00:17:56,910
as a somewhat gluttonous woman,

231
00:17:56,994 --> 00:18:00,205
greedy for all beautiful things in life.
I don't know.

232
00:18:00,289 --> 00:18:03,959
A kind of woman who'd envision the world
as some sort of large ice cream,

233
00:18:04,042 --> 00:18:08,964
or as a good glass of wine,
or a game of blindman's buff.

234
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:10,507
"I'll catch you! Catch me!"

235
00:18:10,591 --> 00:18:12,384
She perceives life as a game,

236
00:18:12,468 --> 00:18:18,307
she enjoys wearing a gorgeous dress,
feeling silk on her body,

237
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:21,643
feeling that men look at her
and desire her.

238
00:18:21,727 --> 00:18:24,897
She embodies our desire to be attractive,
you know?

239
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:27,274
Sandra, I find Magali Noël very good

240
00:18:27,357 --> 00:18:30,652
at playing her as a sort
of placid small-town chicken. Right?

241
00:18:30,736 --> 00:18:34,239
- What do you -
- If you put it that way.

242
00:18:34,323 --> 00:18:38,285
If we're going to speak about fowl -
Even I, when I made 8 1/2,

243
00:18:38,786 --> 00:18:42,790
when I played Mrs. Carla, the lover...

244
00:18:42,873 --> 00:18:46,418
I remember that Federico,
when he was writing the character,

245
00:18:46,502 --> 00:18:50,589
said he envisioned her as a peacock,

246
00:18:50,672 --> 00:18:57,554
with a small head and large -
Well, you know what I mean.

247
00:18:58,806 --> 00:19:04,061
I think I played it quite well.
It was credible.

248
00:19:04,144 --> 00:19:08,482
That's how she was, with a small head.
Like a peacock, right?

249
00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:11,944
But there's a big difference
between a peacock and a chicken!

250
00:19:12,027 --> 00:19:15,280
We're degenerating
into a treatise on ornithology!

251
00:19:16,031 --> 00:19:17,032
Indeed!

252
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:22,496
Hello. Here we are in the studio
of Mr. Fellini in Rome,

253
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:26,583
where he's now making preparations
for his new film.

254
00:19:26,667 --> 00:19:30,754
Also with us is Tonino Guerra,
the famous writer.

255
00:19:30,838 --> 00:19:36,051
Mr. Fellini will answer a few questions
for the German and Munich audience.

256
00:19:36,134 --> 00:19:37,970
If you please, Mr. Fellini,

257
00:19:38,053 --> 00:19:40,514
what is the most emotional,
or most important moment

258
00:19:40,597 --> 00:19:43,433
in the preparation of your new film?

259
00:19:44,393 --> 00:19:46,395
I don't know German. What did she say?

260
00:19:47,312 --> 00:19:52,526
She said she's come from Paris
to the studio.

261
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:54,069
Isn't she German?

262
00:19:54,152 --> 00:19:56,488
Yes, but she traveled through Paris.

263
00:19:56,572 --> 00:20:00,576
She's asking
how many characters in Amarcord...

264
00:20:00,659 --> 00:20:02,953
I didn't get that one word.

265
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:11,795
- I didn't understand.
- I can try to explain in Italian.

266
00:20:11,879 --> 00:20:15,382
Well, if she knows Italian.
Did you understand her?

267
00:20:15,465 --> 00:20:19,511
- Yes, more or less. It's been 25 years.
- If you know Italian, that's better!

268
00:20:20,012 --> 00:20:22,014
We'd like to ask you

269
00:20:22,097 --> 00:20:27,686
what the most bewegende moment -.

270
00:20:28,145 --> 00:20:33,859
There it is! You see,
in Hamburg bewegende means -.

271
00:20:33,942 --> 00:20:36,153
- Do you know German or not?
- It depends on the city!

272
00:20:36,236 --> 00:20:38,447
I told you, I was a prisoner for one year!

273
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:40,908
- It means "to kiss," right?
- He told me he knew -.

274
00:20:40,991 --> 00:20:43,493
Kissing. What?

275
00:20:43,577 --> 00:20:45,787
Come on, Tonino! Kissing?

276
00:20:45,871 --> 00:20:47,873
Excuse me, what does bewegende mean?

277
00:20:53,462 --> 00:20:56,882
- Emotions! See, that's what I meant!
- Come on, Tonino!

278
00:20:57,299 --> 00:20:59,635
We look like a sketch
by the De Rege brothers.

279
00:21:00,677 --> 00:21:03,430
The most emotional moment
in preparing the film?

280
00:21:04,139 --> 00:21:07,935
Well, that moment is right here.

281
00:21:08,018 --> 00:21:12,397
An open office filled with people who -.

282
00:21:12,481 --> 00:21:16,985
Fellini now indulges in his typical act,
reserved for reporters.

283
00:21:17,069 --> 00:21:21,531
The main goal is to say nothing
about the film he is making.

284
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,912
He repeats countless times
for the German reporter

285
00:21:26,995 --> 00:21:32,042
that he sees a film as a journey,
or as a broken statue he must rebuild,

286
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:34,002
after finding
its various scattered fragments.

287
00:21:34,086 --> 00:21:37,547
Or maybe he's telling the story
of the unexpected face,

288
00:21:37,631 --> 00:21:39,925
of the smile
from an unknown attractive woman,

289
00:21:40,008 --> 00:21:45,097
of all the sudden inspiration he gets
from the people who visit his office

290
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,723
or who he meets in the street.

291
00:21:46,807 --> 00:21:51,645
- What's your name?
- Armando Brancia, from Naples. Born 1917.

292
00:21:51,728 --> 00:21:53,563
I'm an actor.

293
00:21:53,647 --> 00:21:55,899
Theater, television.

294
00:21:57,442 --> 00:22:01,196
- I've done very little cinema.
- Would you like to do some more?

295
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:07,244
Yes, I would. But only if it's done well,
at a certain level.

296
00:22:07,744 --> 00:22:13,375
- You know what we need? A cyst.
- A cyst?

297
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:14,710
- Yes.
- Where?

298
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:17,504
Here, on your head.

299
00:22:17,587 --> 00:22:18,714
Right here, you see?

300
00:22:22,259 --> 00:22:25,762
- Well, if you think it's necessary...
- Yes, it's essential.

301
00:22:25,846 --> 00:22:27,556
I'll give the cyst a try.

302
00:22:28,348 --> 00:22:29,933
Here we go, look.

303
00:22:46,283 --> 00:22:50,412
Titta's father has now become
a living creature.

304
00:22:51,705 --> 00:22:55,292
So is Fellini looking
for actors or characters?

305
00:22:55,375 --> 00:23:00,422
In many films
he certainly worked with great actors.

306
00:23:00,922 --> 00:23:05,761
Alberto Sordi is unforgettable
in The White Sheik and I vitelloni.

307
00:23:12,934 --> 00:23:14,061
And what about Gelsomina?

308
00:23:19,733 --> 00:23:22,736
Or Cabiria, played by Giulietta Masina.

309
00:23:26,156 --> 00:23:30,619
And Marcello Mastroianni, who acted
in two of Fellini's best known films:

310
00:23:30,702 --> 00:23:31,995
La dolce vita and 8 1/2.

311
00:23:34,664 --> 00:23:37,084
And great American actors: Anthony Quinn.

312
00:23:38,001 --> 00:23:41,379
Richard Basehart,
who played the Fool in La strada.

313
00:23:42,923 --> 00:23:44,174
Terence Stamp.

314
00:23:47,803 --> 00:23:50,931
Or Broderick Crawford in I'll bidone.

315
00:23:51,515 --> 00:23:56,603
Great theatrical actors: Pupella Maggio,
Peppino De Filippo, Salvo Randone.

316
00:23:58,105 --> 00:24:03,527
But we're particularly interested
in the techniques, the devices,

317
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:05,487
or even the rituals

318
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:11,868
that transform a common person,
not an actor, into a great performer.

319
00:24:13,703 --> 00:24:16,790
What does Fellini teach them,
what does he give them?

320
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:24,631
What does he learn himself?
Does he steal from, or give to his actors?

321
00:24:27,592 --> 00:24:30,470
In an attempt to answer these questions,

322
00:24:30,554 --> 00:24:32,973
we set up a sort of roundtable,

323
00:24:33,056 --> 00:24:37,894
and invited many of the actors
from Amarcord to take part in it.

324
00:24:37,978 --> 00:24:40,522
The architect Brembilla,
who played the hierarch.

325
00:24:40,605 --> 00:24:43,525
Doctor Misul,
who was the professor of philosophy.

326
00:24:43,608 --> 00:24:49,072
Mr. Rossi: The lawyer haunted
by mysterious raspberries. You remember?

327
00:24:49,865 --> 00:24:52,200
Those who've seen the film
may recognize them.

328
00:24:58,582 --> 00:25:00,792
This is the reporter and writer Pertica.

329
00:25:00,876 --> 00:25:04,838
In the film,
he was a blind accordion player.

330
00:25:04,921 --> 00:25:07,465
We also have some of the school kids.

331
00:25:11,761 --> 00:25:14,723
Here they all are,
sitting around the table.

332
00:25:25,859 --> 00:25:29,029
Is Fellini looking for actors
or characters?

333
00:25:29,112 --> 00:25:31,573
This is the topic of the debate.

334
00:25:33,491 --> 00:25:37,329
Let's start with Mr. Ianigro,
who played the grandfather.

335
00:25:37,412 --> 00:25:40,874
He was born in Naples,
where he lives and works as a magician.

336
00:25:41,208 --> 00:25:42,250
Signor Ianigro -.

337
00:25:42,334 --> 00:25:44,502
Why I accepted Fellini's offer?

338
00:25:44,586 --> 00:25:46,379
There are two reasons.

339
00:25:46,463 --> 00:25:49,257
First of all,
because I enjoy the art of theater.

340
00:25:49,341 --> 00:25:53,261
Television, cinema, radio.
I like all these things. It's true.

341
00:25:53,345 --> 00:25:57,140
But also because in 1541,

342
00:25:57,891 --> 00:25:59,559
one of my ancestors...

343
00:25:59,643 --> 00:26:03,230
I come from an ancient family
of actors and magicians.

344
00:26:03,313 --> 00:26:05,357
I'm a magician myself.
I told you that, right?

345
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:10,528
During the film, I wanted to send Fellini
my fluid, but he refused it.

346
00:26:10,612 --> 00:26:12,322
Actually he sent me his.

347
00:26:12,405 --> 00:26:17,160
But he's not a true magician. No!
Because he's from the North.

348
00:26:17,244 --> 00:26:20,372
That's funny!
What difference could there possibly be

349
00:26:20,872 --> 00:26:23,833
between northern and southern magicians?
Can you explain?

350
00:26:23,917 --> 00:26:26,544
There's a big difference.
But I'm not here to explain.

351
00:26:26,628 --> 00:26:31,549
Extras are the supreme amalgam
of the creators of the film itself.

352
00:26:31,633 --> 00:26:32,801
Without extras...

353
00:26:32,884 --> 00:26:35,428
Later, d'Artagnan.
Now's not the right moment.

354
00:26:36,096 --> 00:26:39,849
...the entire harmony of the film
would fall apart. The actor...

355
00:26:39,933 --> 00:26:43,353
D'Artagnan is the stage name
of legendary extra Michele Stinelli.

356
00:26:43,436 --> 00:26:46,940
What was I explaining? Ah, yes!
Why Fellini was sending me his fluid.

357
00:26:47,023 --> 00:26:48,525
He did so to hypnotize me!

358
00:26:49,192 --> 00:26:53,071
To turn me into the grandfather.
That specific grandfather.

359
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:58,034
While we were shooting the fog scene,
where I get lost and frightened,

360
00:26:58,118 --> 00:27:02,455
Fellini kept yelling,
"Ianigro, you can't see a thing!"

361
00:27:02,539 --> 00:27:05,292
But at the same time,
he was sending me his fluid.

362
00:27:05,375 --> 00:27:06,793
But I'm a magician.

363
00:27:06,876 --> 00:27:09,754
Magicians can always see,
even in the dark!

364
00:27:09,838 --> 00:27:14,759
The unqualified say that Fellini messes
with actors' heads to get what he wants.

365
00:27:14,843 --> 00:27:16,011
It's not true.

366
00:27:16,094 --> 00:27:19,222
- I'm done. Thank you.
- What do you think, ma'am?

367
00:27:19,306 --> 00:27:23,977
Magician or not,
I think Fellini's pretty rude!

368
00:27:24,936 --> 00:27:27,147
I'm really sorry for his wife.

369
00:27:28,732 --> 00:27:30,775
Giulietta, yes,

370
00:27:30,859 --> 00:27:33,862
who I adored in Eleonora.
How it made me cry!

371
00:27:33,945 --> 00:27:37,699
I played the maîtresse
who rides the coach with those -.

372
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,078
Yes, the working girls.

373
00:27:42,662 --> 00:27:45,957
I don't know much about these things.
I asked my husband.

374
00:27:46,374 --> 00:27:49,377
But Fellini had promised me
a different part!

375
00:27:49,461 --> 00:27:51,546
What about me? He promised me everything!

376
00:27:51,629 --> 00:27:54,799
He's been promising since 1957!
Since the wedding...

377
00:27:54,883 --> 00:27:58,094
Mr. Satta, you interrupted the lady.
Later, please.

378
00:27:58,178 --> 00:28:00,722
I thought we were here to talk!

379
00:28:00,805 --> 00:28:04,809
Fellini says, "What do you mean, Esther?"
That's my name.

380
00:28:04,893 --> 00:28:07,437
"You mean to tell me
you were never a maîtresse?"

381
00:28:09,898 --> 00:28:15,236
Ma'am, I disagree with you
and our magician Ianigro.

382
00:28:15,779 --> 00:28:20,992
But I'll have to speak to him
about this North and South business.

383
00:28:21,076 --> 00:28:25,163
- That's noxious regionalism.
- What does this guy want?

384
00:28:25,246 --> 00:28:29,542
So you think Fellini has a method
with actors, Mr. Brembilla? What is it?

385
00:28:29,626 --> 00:28:34,422
Ah, well.
The method of flattery, if I may.

386
00:28:34,506 --> 00:28:36,966
I speak out of personal experience.

387
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:40,637
Fellini praises and seduces actors.
He's a siren.

388
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,056
Yes, he's the Rimini siren!

389
00:28:43,139 --> 00:28:47,519
Siren or not, working with him
rejuvenated me.

390
00:28:47,602 --> 00:28:49,437
If you're able to work with him.

391
00:28:49,521 --> 00:28:53,191
Every day, he said something nice to me.

392
00:28:53,274 --> 00:28:55,944
"Brembilla, you're a beauty!"
"What fabulous ears!"

393
00:28:56,027 --> 00:28:58,446
"That mustache really suits you!
Don't shave!"

394
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:00,698
I didn't have a mustache before.

395
00:29:01,116 --> 00:29:02,742
These things make you happy.

396
00:29:03,076 --> 00:29:07,580
I keep the mustache as a souvenir,
even if my wife can't stand it.

397
00:29:07,664 --> 00:29:10,750
Are you going to cut out the stuff I say?

398
00:29:10,834 --> 00:29:14,462
- What are you going to say?
- You guys do that! I know your kind!

399
00:29:15,213 --> 00:29:18,216
- Relax, Robutti.
- It's an interview. Don't cut it, okay?

400
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:23,054
- Tell us your story.
- Fellini said I had to be in the film.

401
00:29:23,138 --> 00:29:25,640
"I won't make the film without you!"
Then he disappeared.

402
00:29:25,723 --> 00:29:29,769
For Amarcord, he called me
and gave me the same song and dance.

403
00:29:30,311 --> 00:29:33,356
"Dear Robutti,
your face is so interesting.

404
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,276
You'll be in my next film."

405
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:39,446
At a certain point, I indulged him.

406
00:29:39,863 --> 00:29:44,325
I said, "Yes, of course!"
Because he kept going.

407
00:29:44,409 --> 00:29:46,870
I thought it would be best to indulge him.

408
00:29:47,245 --> 00:29:49,289
So I pretended that I believed him.

409
00:29:49,789 --> 00:29:52,500
He thought he was fooling me,

410
00:29:52,584 --> 00:29:58,465
but nobody from Rimini
has ever fooled someone from Bologna.

411
00:29:58,548 --> 00:30:03,303
So I let him believe whatever he wanted.
He was happy, and I was too.

412
00:30:04,179 --> 00:30:09,434
Fellini conquers you with friendship.
He's a friend.

413
00:30:09,517 --> 00:30:14,189
The man speaking so affectionately
about Fellini is Nandino Orfei.

414
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:17,692
Yes, that's right.
The lion tamer from the famous circus.

415
00:30:17,775 --> 00:30:21,529
Like in the circus. It's one big family.
It's the same atmosphere!

416
00:30:22,363 --> 00:30:25,783
I felt related to the people
I worked with in the film. Like Brancia.

417
00:30:26,618 --> 00:30:28,661
The actor who plays Titta's father.

418
00:30:28,745 --> 00:30:30,997
One evening he came to the circus,

419
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:34,542
while I was doing
my act with the lions in the cage.

420
00:30:34,626 --> 00:30:36,669
I thought he was watching me

421
00:30:36,753 --> 00:30:39,297
with the same disgusted look
he gives me in the film.

422
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:41,341
I feared the lions might agree with him!

423
00:30:41,424 --> 00:30:43,593
I like working with Fellini,

424
00:30:43,676 --> 00:30:47,430
because he always makes me feel
that he's at ease.

425
00:30:47,514 --> 00:30:50,934
I agree completely with Miss Belluzzi.

426
00:30:51,017 --> 00:30:55,772
What could be more embarrassing
than a raspberry?

427
00:30:55,855 --> 00:30:58,816
While I was shooting,
Fellini bombarded me with raspberries.

428
00:30:59,234 --> 00:31:03,613
It was clearly for reasons of staging.
Still, I never felt uneasy.

429
00:31:03,988 --> 00:31:09,661
Actually, his raspberries thrilled me.
They urged me to do better.

430
00:31:09,744 --> 00:31:13,540
- Brembilla is right on that.
- Thanks.

431
00:31:13,623 --> 00:31:17,794
But when his assistant
blew raspberries at me, Mr. Mein,

432
00:31:18,711 --> 00:31:21,589
it was different, something else.

433
00:31:21,673 --> 00:31:23,716
Even if Mr. Mein is a keen assistant.

434
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:26,261
I deal with penal rehabilitations.

435
00:31:26,344 --> 00:31:29,597
I'm sure that one day
I'll have to rehabilitate someone

436
00:31:29,681 --> 00:31:32,767
who's hit Fellini
on the head with a hammer!

437
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:36,646
Error is only human,
but Fellini exaggerates! 18 years!

438
00:31:36,729 --> 00:31:40,775
Caporale, what's your opinion of Fellini
as a director of actors?

439
00:31:41,693 --> 00:31:47,240
My pure experience was very nice.

440
00:31:47,323 --> 00:31:52,704
This film, Amarcord,
in which I play the role of -.

441
00:31:54,581 --> 00:31:55,623
What?

442
00:31:56,874 --> 00:31:59,085
- Giudizio!
- Giudizio!

443
00:31:59,168 --> 00:32:02,255
I'd like to know what Fellini
asks of an actor.

444
00:32:02,922 --> 00:32:06,426
How does he behave,
what does he do when directing actors?

445
00:32:06,509 --> 00:32:08,636
He behaves very well.

446
00:32:10,555 --> 00:32:12,515
Yes, but can you tell me
anything specific?

447
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:16,728
When you had to do something,
would Fellini explain it to you?

448
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:19,355
Yes, he explained it to me.

449
00:32:19,439 --> 00:32:24,444
But I voluntarily did things

450
00:32:24,527 --> 00:32:27,155
that I wasn't supposed to.

451
00:32:27,238 --> 00:32:31,659
How is that possible?
You did things you weren't supposed to?

452
00:32:31,743 --> 00:32:36,080
I voluntarily did things
I wasn't supposed to.

453
00:32:36,164 --> 00:32:38,916
Why? Was Fellini happy?

454
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,919
He was very happy.

455
00:32:42,003 --> 00:32:45,173
- Did he already know you'd do that?
- Yes - No.

456
00:32:49,218 --> 00:32:54,015
It's time to get rid of demiurge directors
who deem actors merely plastic material!

457
00:32:54,098 --> 00:32:58,853
We're forgetting that if directors
are essential for actors...

458
00:32:58,936 --> 00:33:00,980
Please, Mr. Misul.

459
00:33:01,064 --> 00:33:06,235
...the actor embodies the director's
representation and is the only -.

460
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:08,613
You shouldn't interrupt your colleagues
like that.

461
00:33:08,696 --> 00:33:10,031
Allow me to let off steam.

462
00:33:10,114 --> 00:33:13,368
Arbitrary cuts by celebrity directors
deform all expressive intents,

463
00:33:13,451 --> 00:33:17,789
and brutally wreck the actor's
most meticulous solutions.

464
00:33:17,872 --> 00:33:21,292
I disagree.
He cut out some of my scenes too.

465
00:33:21,376 --> 00:33:24,921
For example,
the one with the tall ugly guy,

466
00:33:25,004 --> 00:33:26,506
I can't remember his name.

467
00:33:27,006 --> 00:33:31,719
There was a scene in which that nasty kid
is hanging out with his friends,

468
00:33:31,803 --> 00:33:33,930
fellow delinquents,

469
00:33:34,013 --> 00:33:40,937
and he enters my tobacco store,
because he's made a bet with his friends

470
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,313
about the weight of...

471
00:33:42,397 --> 00:33:45,650
I don't know
if I'm allowed to say it on television.

472
00:33:45,733 --> 00:33:48,945
The weight of my chest.

473
00:33:49,028 --> 00:33:52,031
So he actually dares ask me,

474
00:33:52,115 --> 00:33:56,411
and I chase him away with a broom.

475
00:33:56,494 --> 00:34:00,248
It was a cute scene.
Fellini cut it from the film.

476
00:34:00,331 --> 00:34:03,376
He's the boss, so he does as he pleases.

477
00:34:03,459 --> 00:34:05,795
I'm in debt towards Fellini.
I owe him everything.

478
00:34:05,878 --> 00:34:09,006
I've received hundreds
of marriage proposals.

479
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:11,718
They want to marry me
and set up a great tobacco store.

480
00:34:11,801 --> 00:34:15,138
And they're all young men
under the age of 30.

481
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:19,225
And people still say unisex women
are fashionable.

482
00:34:19,851 --> 00:34:22,770
And what about Mr. Pertica,
who played the blind -.

483
00:34:22,854 --> 00:34:26,274
- You can see fine, right?
- Yes, I have perfect eyesight.

484
00:34:26,357 --> 00:34:30,695
I also pay plenty of attention
not to trip again.

485
00:34:30,778 --> 00:34:33,740
- I hope you don't call me again.
- You might trip and bump into Fellini!

486
00:34:33,823 --> 00:34:36,492
Yes, I don't want to bump into him.
He's a friend,

487
00:34:36,576 --> 00:34:40,204
but I hope
I don't have to work with him again.

488
00:34:40,621 --> 00:34:46,377
I never smile. A mandibular trismus
prevents me from doing it.

489
00:34:46,461 --> 00:34:49,005
If I do, I suffer terribly.

490
00:34:49,088 --> 00:34:52,925
I told Fellini, but he said,
"That's why you're here.

491
00:34:53,009 --> 00:34:56,262
To smile. Just smile."

492
00:34:56,971 --> 00:35:02,810
One day he threatened to tie elastic bands
from the corners of my mouth to my ears,

493
00:35:02,894 --> 00:35:05,438
but I said "no."

494
00:35:05,521 --> 00:35:07,148
I refused.

495
00:35:07,231 --> 00:35:10,067
I don't question the "Fellini system."

496
00:35:10,735 --> 00:35:16,574
I'm not an actor. I'm a manager
in a major American company.

497
00:35:16,657 --> 00:35:20,244
Yet, what I observed
is certainly very, very strange.

498
00:35:20,328 --> 00:35:23,956
One day in Anzio,
I saw the following scene.

499
00:35:24,665 --> 00:35:26,626
What's the range of the telescope?

500
00:35:26,709 --> 00:35:29,462
If you truly loved me,
you wouldn't have me mocked by people.

501
00:35:29,545 --> 00:35:32,715
You wouldn't rip hair from my ears.
You wouldn't poke my eyes.

502
00:35:32,799 --> 00:35:35,092
But I can't see a thing 400 meters away.

503
00:35:35,593 --> 00:35:38,971
- If you truly loved me.
- Why do you make that remark?

504
00:35:39,055 --> 00:35:43,434
Maselli, the actor by the telescope,
couldn't remember his lines.

505
00:35:43,518 --> 00:35:46,103
So Fellini had him recite
verses from Ciccio Formaggio,

506
00:35:46,187 --> 00:35:49,899
the only song Maselli knows by heart,
as he's been repeating it for 50 years.

507
00:35:49,982 --> 00:35:53,611
Let's see if the others
also found this moment strange.

508
00:35:53,694 --> 00:35:57,114
Mr. Magno, were you disturbed
by those declarations of love by Maselli?

509
00:35:57,198 --> 00:36:00,827
In terms of acting,
not sentimentally, of course.

510
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:04,121
I was saying the lines from the script.

511
00:36:04,205 --> 00:36:10,253
And he kept replying,
"If you truly loved me," and so on.

512
00:36:10,336 --> 00:36:13,506
I had no idea what was going on.

513
00:36:14,215 --> 00:36:16,884
I had no clue where we were in the script.

514
00:36:17,552 --> 00:36:20,930
My psychological predicament
was further worsened

515
00:36:21,639 --> 00:36:27,770
by Mr. Fellini, who would occasionally
come near and ask me,

516
00:36:28,354 --> 00:36:32,775
"Magno, are you sure
you really have no love for Maselli?"

517
00:36:33,484 --> 00:36:36,612
Our roundtable could go on forever,

518
00:36:36,696 --> 00:36:39,198
as there's so much to talk about.

519
00:36:39,282 --> 00:36:44,829
For example, Mrs. Stagni remembers
being very confused due to anemones.

520
00:36:45,371 --> 00:36:49,458
Ever since I was a child,
I was always allergic to those flowers.

521
00:36:49,542 --> 00:36:53,796
We could listen to an infinity
of such revelations and justifications,

522
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:58,301
each one sincere, funny
and full of bizarre, tender humanity.

523
00:36:59,051 --> 00:37:01,262
But now is the time to come to an end.

524
00:37:01,345 --> 00:37:04,807
As you saw, the obscure relationship
between Fellini and his actors

525
00:37:04,891 --> 00:37:06,601
was neither clarified nor defined.

526
00:37:06,684 --> 00:37:09,061
It was merely represented.

527
00:37:09,604 --> 00:37:15,526
We think the sense, the feelings emerging
from the meeting you just watched

528
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:18,362
reveal the mutual indispensability

529
00:37:18,446 --> 00:37:22,491
binding Fellini to the creatures
who inhabit his stories.

530
00:37:22,575 --> 00:37:25,870
All these characters
following him from one film to the next,

531
00:37:25,953 --> 00:37:29,832
are ultimately more necessary for Fellini
than he is for them.

532
00:37:29,916 --> 00:37:34,003
That's right. If Ingmar Bergman
has his Max Von Sydow,

533
00:37:34,086 --> 00:37:38,132
his Gunnar Björnstrand, Ingrid Thulin,
Harriet Andersson,

534
00:37:38,466 --> 00:37:43,137
Fellini has his Stagni,
Caporale, Satta, Magno.

535
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:46,057
They're certainly different
from their Nordic colleagues,

536
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:50,603
but we find them to be equally important,
and maybe more inimitable.

537
00:37:51,729 --> 00:37:53,606
ROTA: ALL FELLINI'S FILMS

538
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:13,167
Who could help us end this conversation
better than Nino Rota,

539
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:15,920
who composed the music
for all Fellini's films?

540
00:38:16,379 --> 00:38:17,755
What do you want?

541
00:38:17,838 --> 00:38:20,049
Excuse us, Nino. It's for the interview.

542
00:38:20,132 --> 00:38:23,094
We'd like to ask how you compose music
for Fellini's films.

543
00:38:23,177 --> 00:38:25,471
How does your collaboration work?

544
00:38:25,554 --> 00:38:28,140
Music for Fellini's films?

545
00:38:32,436 --> 00:38:35,898
We write the scores
for Fellini's films so quickly

546
00:38:35,982 --> 00:38:39,610
that out of decency,
it's better we don't talk about it.

547
00:38:39,694 --> 00:38:40,945
Why?

548
00:38:41,028 --> 00:38:44,323
People would think that we don't -.

549
00:38:44,407 --> 00:38:46,325
Here you are, maestro.

550
00:38:46,409 --> 00:38:49,704
Not that we do it with facility,
but that we don't take it seriously.

551
00:38:49,787 --> 00:38:52,873
After you've come up with the theme
what happens next?

552
00:38:52,957 --> 00:38:55,167
Do you write it down right away?

553
00:38:55,251 --> 00:38:58,254
Federico doesn't like it
when I write it down immediately.

554
00:38:58,337 --> 00:39:01,048
But there's the danger
that I might think of another theme

555
00:39:01,132 --> 00:39:02,717
and forget the first one.

556
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,553
So now he encourages me
to write it down immediately -.

557
00:39:06,178 --> 00:39:08,472
No, thanks. I don't smoke.

558
00:39:08,556 --> 00:39:10,516
And the cigarette?

559
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:12,435
- I'll just keep it here.
- As a souvenir.

560
00:39:12,518 --> 00:39:16,313
Fellini never goes to concerts,
never directed an opera, not even yours.

561
00:39:16,397 --> 00:39:19,567
Why do you think
he's so allergic to music?

562
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:22,069
I wouldn't say he's allergic to music.

563
00:39:22,153 --> 00:39:26,574
He's unable to listen to music
in a distracted way.

564
00:39:26,657 --> 00:39:31,537
He either participates and is moved by it,
or it annoys him.

565
00:39:31,871 --> 00:39:33,539
He's not at my insane levels:

566
00:39:33,622 --> 00:39:39,503
I can compose music while listening
to something else on the radio.

567
00:39:40,004 --> 00:39:41,797
But Fellini's insane in his own way.

568
00:39:41,881 --> 00:39:45,968
Sometimes he has buskers thrown out
of restaurants, did you know that?

569
00:39:46,052 --> 00:39:47,887
I know all about it.

570
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:51,766
He did so more than once,
and caused me great embarrassment.

571
00:39:52,183 --> 00:39:54,894
After all, they're my colleagues.

572
00:39:54,977 --> 00:39:59,106
One day, I may be playing with them too.

573
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:01,525
Excuse me, Nino.

574
00:40:01,609 --> 00:40:06,155
How did you come up with the main theme
for Amarcord, Gradisca's theme?

575
00:40:06,238 --> 00:40:09,909
Federico and I usually come up
with the themes together.

576
00:40:09,992 --> 00:40:13,454
He often gives me
very precise suggestions,

577
00:40:13,537 --> 00:40:15,873
but sometimes also
very contradictory suggestions.

578
00:40:15,956 --> 00:40:18,459
He tells me to find
an amusing theme that's sad,

579
00:40:18,542 --> 00:40:22,546
an old-fashioned theme that sounds new,

580
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:25,466
something carefree but also moving.

581
00:40:26,175 --> 00:40:32,014
We fooled around for a whole day,
and nothing was coming out.

582
00:40:32,098 --> 00:40:35,935
Finally, when Federico's about to leave,
I plunk out a tune on the piano.

583
00:40:45,319 --> 00:40:48,697
He stops and says, "That's it!

584
00:40:48,781 --> 00:40:50,991
We'll do the whole film with that."

585
00:41:20,229 --> 00:41:22,606
For those who worked on the film,

586
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:25,734
these fragments you have seen
from the production of Amarcord

587
00:41:25,818 --> 00:41:29,405
still feel so fresh and urgent
that we may even ask ourselves,

588
00:41:29,488 --> 00:41:31,657
"Which was the real film?

589
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:33,284
The one we watched in the theaters,

590
00:41:33,868 --> 00:41:39,540
or the daily, passionate adventure
of those who followed its development?"

591
00:43:04,083 --> 00:43:05,334
There it is!

592
00:43:05,417 --> 00:43:06,877
Dad!

593
00:43:06,961 --> 00:43:10,256
The Rex!

594
00:43:11,090 --> 00:43:15,803
Hurray for the Rex!
The greatest thing the regime ever built!

595
00:44:38,218 --> 00:44:42,598
SECRET DIARY OF AMARCORD
