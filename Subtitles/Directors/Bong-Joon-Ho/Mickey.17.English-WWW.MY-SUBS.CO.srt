2
00:01:15,666 --> 00:01:23,666
How did I survive that?

3
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:32,250
It was some damn fall.

4
00:01:33,833 --> 00:01:36,625
Shit, my comms busted.

5
00:01:37,541 --> 00:01:39,250
All my thermals busted too.

6
00:01:41,125 --> 00:01:44,291
I should have got snapped
in half and died on the way down.

7
00:01:44,583 --> 00:01:47,541
Instead of slowly
turning into a meat popsicle.

8
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Cool.

9
00:01:52,875 --> 00:01:53,875
Tina!

10
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:56,583
Tina!

11
00:01:56,625 --> 00:01:57,625
I'm down here!

12
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:08,750
Mickey?

13
00:02:10,125 --> 00:02:11,125
Tina!

14
00:02:11,458 --> 00:02:12,458
Tina, I'm down here!

15
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:14,458
Mickey, whoa.

16
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:16,333
You haven't died yet?

17
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:17,916
No.

18
00:02:18,416 --> 00:02:19,416
Hold on.

19
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:30,458
Oh shit.

20
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,240
Your flamethrower's still good.

21
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:35,666
Not a single scratch.

22
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:38,966
It's a good thing I
thought to come down here.

23
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,360
Weapons will be happy to see this.

24
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:42,316
Yeah, I'm gonna turn this in, okay?

25
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:43,666
I can take it.

26
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,250
You're not mad, right?

27
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:47,791
I'm just taking this?

28
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:51,958
I mean, it's not
looking very good for you, right?

29
00:02:52,708 --> 00:02:55,416
Also, line only goes this far.

30
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:56,583
Uh-huh.

31
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,250
Yeah, no.

32
00:02:59,458 --> 00:03:00,916
We're cool.

33
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:05,083
You shouldn't have
to take the rest, guys.

34
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:07,500
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

35
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:14,031
Plus, they're gonna
reprint you back out tomorrow anyway.

36
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:17,291
Yeah.

37
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:21,875
Hey, Mickey.

38
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:23,666
Yeah?

39
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:25,875
What's it feel like to die?

40
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:32,708
I'm sure you're used to it by now.

41
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,500
Still.

42
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:43,500
How many times is this?

43
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:45,791
You're Mickey 16?

44
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:48,666
17.

45
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,750
Jerk.

46
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,208
18 after this one.

47
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:55,000
Well, it's nice knowing you.

48
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:56,291
Have a nice death.

49
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:57,666
See you tomorrow.

50
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:02,583
Oh, great.

51
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:05,458
Why not?

52
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,666
Oh, that's a pretty big one.

53
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:16,875
Hopefully I'll just
get swallowed in one go.

54
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:19,458
It's gotta be better
than slowly freezing to death.

55
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:21,458
I guess.

56
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:40,666
Or maybe not.

57
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:58,458
But they just printed
me out again every time I died.

58
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:03,500
All my data is saved,
and I just get a whole new body.

59
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:08,351
They do all this kind
of regular uploads of memories

60
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:14,392
and my personality traits
and re-implant it back in my brain.

61
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:19,147
That's some crazy
technology, man. It's just...

62
00:05:19,171 --> 00:05:24,125
Let's just say it's advanced.
It's very advanced.

63
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:30,458
Wait!

64
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:33,083
Just hold on a second.

65
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:34,541
Just like...

66
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:36,375
Just relax. Breathe.

67
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:37,583
Breathe.

68
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:42,916
The whole body training
and memory transplanting thing

69
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:47,392
to be honest, it was so
ridiculously ahead of its time

70
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:53,041
that it caused so many ethical
fights and religious blah blah blah.

71
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:56,000
It was actually banned on Earth,

72
00:05:56,291 --> 00:06:00,958
and they only allowed now in
outer space for expandables like me.

73
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:03,851
So from the second
we left the atmosphere,

74
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:06,541
they made me work my ass
off all the way to this planet,

75
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:09,166
giving me one mission after another.

76
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:12,916
Uh, Tech? What's going on?

77
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:15,333
The actual cable's here already.

78
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,916
Um, the thing is, Mickey...

79
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:20,816
Hey, medical, you want to tell him?

80
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:23,458
Tell me what?

81
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,200
Hi, Mickey. How are you doing?

82
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:28,458
Are you experiencing any
vertigo, nausea or dizziness?

83
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:32,916
Uh, I guess I am feeling a little dizzy.

84
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:37,041
It's only going to get worse
from here, Mickey, with a nice fever, too.

85
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:41,351
Truth is, you're exposed to
unthinkable levels of radiation right now,

86
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:43,875
which is why we sent
you out in the first place.

87
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:45,208
Okay.

88
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:47,781
If you could give us a
full description of your symptoms.

89
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:52,416
So, a couple things I want to go
through on our cosmic radiation checklist.

90
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:55,833
First, how long
until your skin starts to burn?

91
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:58,750
Then, how long until you go blind?

92
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:01,375
And of course, how long until you die?

93
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:04,375
That's the real nut we're after.

94
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:10,976
There was this one time
in my fourth grade science class,

95
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I messed with a lab frog.

96
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:17,000
I just figured this
all must be my punishment.

97
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:23,875
Mickey, take off your glove so I can
see what's happening under your space suit.

98
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,416
Oh! Oh! Wow!

99
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:37,750
Did you see that?

100
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:06,458
Good morning.

101
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:09,708
Keep yourself hydrated, Mickey.

102
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:11,708
Start to feel extremely crushed.

103
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:14,138
Our cardiac, I
think the dose was too high.

104
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:16,791
Who cares, Dorothy? He's
going to be dead in 10 minutes.

105
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:18,803
Just focus on
getting all the blood samples.

106
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,640
He's going to bleed through
his eyes, nose, mouth, ears and rectum.

107
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:26,166
Make sure to collect
separate samples from every home, okay?

108
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:28,666
And keep the memory
upload going at the same time.

109
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:32,848
This Mickey
special, you know that, right?

110
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:36,208
But of all the Mickey's, you
will have the shortest life spanner.

111
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:40,083
I heard, I'm telling you this.

112
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:42,791
Oh, actually, good news.

113
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:44,625
It's more like 15.

114
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:46,833
Much better, isn't it?

115
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,250
I would have been filthy
rich by now with life insurance,

116
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:55,041
except I've obviously
expendables are uninsurable.

117
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:59,708
There's no workers comp,
no unions, no pension benefits.

118
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:03,416
Now, I wouldn't be surprised
if you were thinking at this point,

119
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:06,333
"Well, now, why did
you do this to yourself?"

120
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:11,934
Well, because I had a
friend who told me that one day

121
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:14,875
macarons would sell better than burgers.

122
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:19,976
And because I trusted this shitty friend

123
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,184
and I got an enormous
loan from a wonderful gentleman

124
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:25,458
to open a macaron store.

125
00:09:58,208 --> 00:10:02,166
All right, all right, calm down.

126
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:04,916
I'm well aware
that you're four weeks left.

127
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:07,000
Just think of this
as a little field trip.

128
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:10,642
In case of what, man, poor
old should you fail to reimburse us

129
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:11,708
in a timely manner.

130
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,476
Besides, you two have
a lot of time on your hands

131
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,666
with your little macaron shotgun under.

132
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:21,101
Whoo! This is quite a
show you got on here for me.

133
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:22,965
Quite a show. The
message is clear. I hear you.

134
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:24,851
I hear it loud and
clear. I'm late. I'm late.

135
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:26,851
The money is late. It's
coming. Two people behind me.

136
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:30,291
Darius Blank, a
name I wish I'd never heard.

137
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:34,250
Mr. Blank isn't all
that concerned with money.

138
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:35,875
He has plenty.

139
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:38,375
This Billy's just one of his many assets.

140
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:41,791
Watching his delinquent borrowers die,

141
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,750
savoring the details of
death, that he truly enjoys.

142
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:48,476
The message is clear.
You can stop now. We can stop.

143
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,250
You know, it's... I hear you.

144
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:53,708
Two weeks is all it
takes. All it takes now.

145
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:55,250
And most people...

146
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,809
Who caught that, gentlemen, four days ago

147
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:10,666
at Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia?

148
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:12,291
Looks expensive.

149
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:16,291
Best assured,
anyone who misses the deadline,

150
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:19,000
we chase them to the ends of the Earth.

151
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,916
So we decided to get off of Earth.

152
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:25,309
Nothing was working out,

153
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:27,392
and I got no family lying on me.

154
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:28,936
So I applied to the dead. Lying on me.

155
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:31,291
So I applied to the colony expedition,

156
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,833
but there's like a million
other people with the same idea.

157
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:36,017
Seems like the
whole of this rotten planet

158
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:37,321
was running away from something.

159
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:39,416
I guess everybody's got money problems.

160
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:42,559
But anyway, we had to get on this ship,

161
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:44,291
because it was the
last one of the season.

162
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:48,767
Waves upon waves of
people desperate to leave Earth.

163
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:51,892
It's clear, anti-migrationists
are talking to a brick wall

164
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:54,125
when they insist on fixing up the Earth

165
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:58,291
instead of risking lives
by migrating to another planet.

166
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:01,041
It feels like these passionate applicants

167
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:03,166
are already off in space.

168
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:05,726
More importantly, this is the expedition

169
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:08,708
led by former
Congressman Kenneth Marshall,

170
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:11,333
who lost his last two elections.

171
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:13,250
Is this failed politician?

172
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:16,833
Now trying to
establish a kingdom beyond the stars,

173
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:19,517
is it his fanatical supporters

174
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:21,416
who won him a generous sponsorship

175
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:25,041
from a particular
religious organisation and corporation?

176
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,666
So many questions left unanswered.

177
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:29,416
Let's go and talk to the crowd.

178
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:32,083
Excuse me, are you a
Kenneth Marshall supporter?

179
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:34,375
I am. I am, big time.

180
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:36,250
I am a full-on supporter.

181
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,958
I basically am the one and only.

182
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:40,333
Are you from Marshall's official channel?

183
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:42,250
No way!

184
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:43,958
So Marshall's watching this right now?

185
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:45,060
Oh, my God.

186
00:12:45,084 --> 00:12:47,625
You need to pick me.
I swear. Please, pick me.

187
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:50,000
You need people young and hungry.

188
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:54,291
Ladies and gentlemen, we
have another mild-stand start today.

189
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:56,541
Access is now restricted to game three.

190
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:59,708
Please visit our stand
for discounted goggles and masks.

191
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:03,166
Additional by present
on with partial pay, as always.

192
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:06,726
The other expeditions
wouldn't take me, but they're wrong.

193
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,250
I promise I can fix toilets.

194
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,430
I make
gingerbreads. You've got to take me.

195
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:11,541
Make me a shot.

196
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:22,083
"Expendable"?

197
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:26,208
You're planning to
be an expendable? Seriously?

198
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:30,351
You read through the whole application.

199
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:32,875
Uh, yeah.

200
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:35,366
I should have read through it.

201
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:37,833
I didn't have too much of a choice.

202
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:41,416
I don't have any bonafide certifications.

203
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:44,515
I don't really
have any skills whatsoever.

204
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:51,125
Then I find out Timo's already
called dibs on a position for himself.

205
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:55,958
As a flitter pilot, he only just got his
learner's permit a couple of weeks before.

206
00:13:57,875 --> 00:13:59,726
No idea what he
had to come up with to pull

207
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:02,291
that off, but
you've got to give it to him.

208
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:04,916
Excuse me.

209
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:09,541
Is there, like,
some construction going on?

210
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:11,166
Sorry, what?

211
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:11,416
I don't hear like a...

212
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:14,250
I don't hear like a...

213
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:16,541
No, like a chainsaw.

214
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:19,166
Uh, no.

215
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:22,250
I wanted to get the hell out of there.

216
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:25,750
Somewhere where the
sound couldn't follow me.

217
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:27,625
Far out into space.

218
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:31,573
You read through the paperwork.

219
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:32,708
Yes.

220
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:37,000
You read it, so you know right.
This is going to be a pretty extreme job.

221
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:39,416
But it's also going to be fun.

222
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:42,166
Fun. I'll explain all the details.

223
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:47,791
I got so distracted by that
smell, the smell of this woman's hair.

224
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:52,166
It was like it brought back
some faraway memory or something.

225
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:56,458
That giant tank
downstairs is called a cycler.

226
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:59,416
It takes organic
waste produced in the spaceship.

227
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:05,416
Apple peels, chicken bones, rotten eggs,
dead bodies, human waste, you name it.

228
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:12,833
Then it combines, refines and recycles
them and sends a portion to this printer.

229
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:15,541
Raw materials for a human body.

230
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:18,517
Once you die and the
committee approves, it'll

231
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:21,375
print a new version
of your body within 20 hours.

232
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:25,666
Take your clothes off. Change into this.

233
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:29,416
I couldn't even
hear anything she was saying.

234
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:33,750
It was like all my
senses were focused on my nose.

235
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:38,666
Like real deja vu, but for a smell.

236
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:43,250
We're going to do a
full scan of your bio data.

237
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:46,708
That means you'll be
reprinted exactly as you are right now.

238
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:48,333
Forever.

239
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:56,875
I better not this. Otherwise
it'll be there every now and then.

240
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:00,366
Well, I'm glad she didn't
know about the one on my butt.

241
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:09,083
So after she does the body
scan, she uploaded my memories.

242
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:11,875
Call it a personality backup.

243
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:14,392
I got to do this once a week so I don't

244
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:16,958
have any big gaps
every time they print me out.

245
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:20,059
In the past you would
have needed a hard drive the

246
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:22,958
size of a commercial
refrigerator to copy an adult brain.

247
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:26,166
Now this little brick, clever, right?

248
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:30,226
So I was injected with some special

249
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:33,791
solution and brought
back a flood of old memories.

250
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:37,083
Too many memories.

251
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:42,931
We were heading
home from the supermarket.

252
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:45,791
I asked to sit in the front seat.

253
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:47,791
I said I'm big enough.

254
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:50,208
And that's when I saw the red button.

255
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:53,166
I pressed it and she crashed.

256
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:29,291
I pulled the trigger.

257
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:33,125
This is the final
requirement to become expendable.

258
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:36,208
Prove to me you
have faith in this system.

259
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:39,958
From now on you
need to get used to dying.

260
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:42,208
This is your job.

261
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:09,083
I began the four and a
half year journey as Mickey One.

262
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:18,000
When you're stuck in a spaceship
for that long, food is everything.

263
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:24,791
Warning, Mickey One. Seven calories
over the current ration allocation.

264
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:41,267
On that first day
in the cafeteria, I think I

265
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:45,208
might have started
thinking, what have I done a little?

266
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,517
The whole room was full of people eating

267
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:49,416
this crappy food
and there's total silence.

268
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:54,133
Like you could hear a
pin drop until Kenneth

269
00:18:54,157 --> 00:18:58,125
Marshall and his
wife, Ilfa, walk in.

270
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:02,583
And a whole bunch of
people just started going nuts.

271
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:16,458
I was thinking, what
the hell am I doing here?

272
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:23,500
But that's when I saw her.

273
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:26,375
Nasha.

274
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:31,291
That was the first
time I saw Nasha Barrage.

275
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:37,916
On day one of this long journey.

276
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,750
All right, enough and now.

277
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:42,916
Keep that up for one
minute and you waste five calories.

278
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:46,416
That's two percent of the
precious meal you're eating right now.

279
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:49,892
As you know, our
number one priority is to

280
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:53,333
conserve food resources
until our arrival at Niffle Line.

281
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:55,916
So that we maximize our survival rate.

282
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:57,458
So listen up.

283
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:00,250
Sexual intercourse, for example.

284
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:05,750
Each session
consumes a whopping 100 calories.

285
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:07,708
At least.

286
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:12,166
Depending on the participant's
duration times friction equals...

287
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:14,434
The point is Kenneth is talking to the

288
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:17,541
committee about banning
all sexual activity on the ship.

289
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:29,809
Darling, are you sure this
is the right time to bring that up?

290
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:32,375
Oh honey, I'm sorry. I
was just trying to help you.

291
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:36,625
It's okay, Ilfa.

292
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:38,500
Am I doing okay?

293
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:40,185
Should I go harder?

294
00:21:40,209 --> 00:21:41,416
Yes, yes. Go harder.

295
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:42,458
No!

296
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:47,892
For the pioneers, once we've arrived at

297
00:21:47,916 --> 00:21:50,250
Niffle Line, we've
secured our food production.

298
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:56,291
We will launch the greatest
sex encouragement campaign in history.

299
00:21:57,458 --> 00:21:58,458
Come on!

300
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:05,916
You will spread
your seed across the planet.

301
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:11,375
But we survive!

302
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Never survive!

303
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:15,750
Never your mark will walk the line!

304
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:20,000
Propagated species,
we shall defend the land!

305
00:22:22,791 --> 00:22:27,250
So we started infesting.

306
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:30,375
With love.

307
00:22:31,541 --> 00:22:32,541
Please.

308
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:34,125
Please.

309
00:22:37,458 --> 00:22:40,041
Unfortunately, this is...

310
00:22:40,458 --> 00:22:41,458
You're not gonna speak.

311
00:22:43,458 --> 00:22:44,833
Come on, it's so happy.

312
00:22:53,458 --> 00:22:57,291
Those four years would have
felt like 40 if it weren't for Nasha.

313
00:22:58,375 --> 00:23:00,333
She stayed with me in the best of times.

314
00:23:02,833 --> 00:23:04,833
And kept by my
side in the worst of times.

315
00:23:13,958 --> 00:23:16,666
Not everyone gets lucky
enough to find a soulmate like this.

316
00:23:17,291 --> 00:23:20,011
None of this would have happened
if I'd never boarded this spaceship.

317
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,750
So I'll hail the
great loan shark Darius Blank.

318
00:23:23,541 --> 00:23:24,541
Thanks, Darius.

319
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,309
But it wasn't like
I was slacking, though.

320
00:23:27,333 --> 00:23:30,166
I was super busy
every day taking care of Nasha.

321
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,958
She's an all-in-one elite agent.

322
00:23:34,458 --> 00:23:36,601
It's not easy supporting someone who's a

323
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:39,750
soldier, a police
officer, and a firefighter.

324
00:23:40,125 --> 00:23:42,791
But what she sees in me, I got no idea.

325
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,500
I'm just grateful.

326
00:23:46,166 --> 00:23:49,250
But as soon as I step out the
door, the ship was filled with mostly...

327
00:23:50,166 --> 00:23:50,416
dickets.

328
00:23:50,833 --> 00:23:52,166
Hey, Mickey, right?

329
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Come with me to ask.

330
00:23:58,458 --> 00:24:00,416
What's it like to die?

331
00:24:01,458 --> 00:24:05,458
You know, when you're
reprinted, now how does that feel?

332
00:24:07,083 --> 00:24:09,416
Oh, come on, just tell
us. We really want to know.

333
00:24:10,083 --> 00:24:13,208
Imagine spending years
elbow-to-elbow with these bozos.

334
00:24:13,583 --> 00:24:15,263
It was enough to
push anyone over the edge.

335
00:24:17,166 --> 00:24:19,642
Sometimes even if Nasha, who is a model

336
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:22,333
citizen, would have
to step in and remind us...

337
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:25,041
that we were all one big happy family.

338
00:24:25,458 --> 00:24:27,125
They're to help one another.

339
00:24:27,625 --> 00:24:29,025
They're to have each other's backs.

340
00:24:29,458 --> 00:24:31,833
A tight-knit, harmonious community.

341
00:24:33,291 --> 00:24:36,625
And the committee has
reduced Mickey Nines' rations by half...

342
00:24:36,958 --> 00:24:40,500
and the scientific manual
cyclo-cleaning until further notice.

343
00:24:43,791 --> 00:24:44,791
Hey, Mickey.

344
00:24:45,458 --> 00:24:47,458
You must be hungry. Have some more.

345
00:24:48,875 --> 00:24:51,041
Uh, thanks, Kai.

346
00:24:52,125 --> 00:24:54,833
Can you change your shampoo?

347
00:24:55,625 --> 00:24:55,916
Shampoo?

348
00:24:56,458 --> 00:24:59,392
It's only one shampoo in
this entire spaceship. Thank you.

349
00:24:59,416 --> 00:25:00,416
Okay.

350
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:05,333
It was a very long
trip in a beautiful community.

351
00:25:05,791 --> 00:25:06,000
Hi.

352
00:25:06,208 --> 00:25:12,250
But, uh, Nasha was
obviously my one and only, you know.

353
00:25:14,041 --> 00:25:15,041
For real.

354
00:25:16,833 --> 00:25:23,125
And as for my one and
only job, I was proud of it.

355
00:25:23,916 --> 00:25:25,458
I felt like I was part of the team.

356
00:25:27,458 --> 00:25:30,250
Mati! Mati!

357
00:25:31,375 --> 00:25:32,375
Oh, last one!

358
00:25:32,625 --> 00:25:33,625
Oh, Korea!

359
00:25:34,875 --> 00:25:37,083
Oh! Quickly!

360
00:25:39,625 --> 00:25:41,125
My brother travelers...

361
00:25:41,416 --> 00:25:41,791
She had sisters.

362
00:25:42,333 --> 00:25:43,333
And sisters.

363
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:48,000
It is long that we have come
four years together in this ship...

364
00:25:48,375 --> 00:25:51,750
and that we love
you like our merry old family.

365
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,416
And here we are, right below us awaits...

366
00:25:55,458 --> 00:25:59,625
our merry old planet of purity.

367
00:26:02,458 --> 00:26:05,500
What's wrong with him? He's flying away!

368
00:26:07,083 --> 00:26:08,750
Maybe he has a blue or something.

369
00:26:09,791 --> 00:26:12,916
Like a virgin vanilla ice cream.

370
00:26:13,541 --> 00:26:15,583
Touched for the very first time.

371
00:26:16,916 --> 00:26:18,500
What do we really call him?

372
00:26:19,125 --> 00:26:21,416
Whoever's gone down
there first come freeze to death.

373
00:26:22,458 --> 00:26:26,375
That's it. Make a
deep breath. Fill your lungs.

374
00:26:27,541 --> 00:26:29,500
Imagine there's an
unknown virus in the air...

375
00:26:29,791 --> 00:26:33,250
and you're sucking in every single
microscopic particle floating around.

376
00:26:33,791 --> 00:26:35,000
All the viruses...

377
00:26:36,458 --> 00:26:38,708
fill every avioli.

378
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:42,750
So good!

379
00:26:44,291 --> 00:26:45,291
Oh, so good!

380
00:26:45,708 --> 00:26:46,708
Brilliant.

381
00:26:47,375 --> 00:26:49,416
There really was an
unknown virus in the air.

382
00:26:49,458 --> 00:26:52,000
Uh, lethal one?

383
00:27:44,458 --> 00:27:46,458
Don't move! Don't move!

384
00:27:50,458 --> 00:27:54,000
Oh, man! He's alive!

385
00:27:55,375 --> 00:27:56,375
So fucking long.

386
00:27:56,916 --> 00:27:57,916
I'm fine.

387
00:28:00,666 --> 00:28:02,000
Thank you.

388
00:28:05,208 --> 00:28:10,833
In the end, thanks to the lab
rats Mickey 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16...

389
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:14,625
getting stab gas dumped
and burned, we got the vaccine.

390
00:28:15,416 --> 00:28:16,416
My great gift to mankind.

391
00:28:16,458 --> 00:28:20,750
And so, we didn't need oxygen masks...

392
00:28:21,416 --> 00:28:23,456
and we could see our
breath as much as we wanted.

393
00:28:24,166 --> 00:28:26,500
Look at that, Jennifer. Ridiculous.

394
00:28:27,333 --> 00:28:29,013
I can't believe
it's the living that thing.

395
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:30,416
I know, right?

396
00:28:30,541 --> 00:28:35,125
Plantfall was ages ago and we're still
eating the same crappy inflight TV dinner.

397
00:28:36,626 --> 00:28:39,750
Precisely why we ought
to build residential complexes.

398
00:28:40,458 --> 00:28:42,226
Grow crops as soon as possible.

399
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:42,958
Yeah, sure.

400
00:28:43,125 --> 00:28:44,125
Spread the seed.

401
00:28:44,208 --> 00:28:44,416
Invest the land.

402
00:28:44,458 --> 00:28:46,791
Propagate the species.

403
00:28:50,083 --> 00:28:51,083
It's freezing.

404
00:29:08,958 --> 00:29:10,583
Whoa. Look at that colour.

405
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:12,083
Yeah, it's beautiful.

406
00:29:16,458 --> 00:29:20,059
He's such a close. You
should learn some breakfault moves.

407
00:29:20,083 --> 00:29:20,500
You okay?

408
00:29:20,833 --> 00:29:21,833
Yeah, I'm fine.

409
00:29:22,125 --> 00:29:23,125
Come on.

410
00:29:26,458 --> 00:29:27,500
What's breakfall?

411
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:30,517
Look at the colour.
Take us for perfect breakfault.

412
00:29:30,541 --> 00:29:30,833
Yeah.

413
00:29:31,125 --> 00:29:32,125
Shut up.

414
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
God.

415
00:29:42,583 --> 00:29:43,583
What is it?

416
00:29:48,458 --> 00:29:49,458
What's that?

417
00:29:50,584 --> 00:29:51,767
What's that?

418
00:29:52,001 --> 00:29:54,125
Get out! Get out! Get out!

419
00:29:55,917 --> 00:29:57,976
What the fuck?

420
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
What the fuck?

421
00:29:59,458 --> 00:30:00,208
What's going on?

422
00:30:00,458 --> 00:30:01,000
What's that?

423
00:30:01,458 --> 00:30:02,208
What the hell was that?

424
00:30:02,458 --> 00:30:04,218
I don't know, but
there are more in the hole.

425
00:30:05,458 --> 00:30:07,208
Let's get the fuck out of here.

426
00:30:08,166 --> 00:30:09,206
Come on, Mickey. Let's go.

427
00:30:10,834 --> 00:30:12,083
Go, go, go. Move, move.

428
00:30:25,458 --> 00:30:26,625
Thank you.

429
00:30:28,458 --> 00:30:29,458
Mickey.

430
00:30:29,708 --> 00:30:30,708
Mickey, it's my show.

431
00:30:32,458 --> 00:30:35,208
You fucking useless little asshole.

432
00:30:35,833 --> 00:30:36,833
You're an expendable.

433
00:30:37,208 --> 00:30:38,809
You're here to be expended, dammit.

434
00:30:38,833 --> 00:30:39,291
I'm so sorry.

435
00:30:39,583 --> 00:30:42,458
And my is Jennifer
Chilton, a precious, fertile,

436
00:30:42,791 --> 00:30:44,291
female, dead and not of you.

437
00:30:44,833 --> 00:30:45,958
How do you try this?

438
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:49,458
You know, that's what I want to know.

439
00:30:49,916 --> 00:30:50,916
You disgusting.

440
00:30:51,333 --> 00:30:51,625
Really?

441
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:52,750
You like my sauce?

442
00:30:53,041 --> 00:30:54,666
No, no, no, no, darling.

443
00:30:55,166 --> 00:30:56,642
Those things, look at them.

444
00:30:56,666 --> 00:30:57,416
What's going on?

445
00:30:57,666 --> 00:30:59,083
They're delicious, aren't they?

446
00:30:59,458 --> 00:31:01,517
Oh, how do you not like it?

447
00:31:01,541 --> 00:31:03,250
You, stand still. Don't move.

448
00:31:05,666 --> 00:31:08,708
They lust for human flesh.

449
00:31:12,208 --> 00:31:13,208
They're creepy.

450
00:31:14,083 --> 00:31:15,708
Oh, honey, that's perfect.

451
00:31:15,958 --> 00:31:17,059
You should call them creepers.

452
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:18,083
I'll call them creepers.

453
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,083
I'm calling them creepers.

454
00:31:20,416 --> 00:31:21,576
President, are you listening?

455
00:31:22,458 --> 00:31:23,000
Expendable.

456
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:25,958
I decided in the
committee that going forward,

457
00:31:26,166 --> 00:31:28,125
your rations will be halved.

458
00:31:29,458 --> 00:31:30,500
So my shift doubled.

459
00:31:31,625 --> 00:31:34,250
14 hours every day, seven days a week,

460
00:31:34,458 --> 00:31:37,375
until I brought home a creeper sample.

461
00:31:38,833 --> 00:31:40,458
Tima! Tima!

462
00:32:31,458 --> 00:32:33,208
How did I survive that?

463
00:32:37,875 --> 00:32:45,875
Woah, you haven't died yet?

464
00:32:51,708 --> 00:32:52,788
What's it feel like to die?

465
00:32:55,875 --> 00:32:57,541
Even on my 17th go around,

466
00:32:58,083 --> 00:32:59,416
I really hate dying.

467
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:03,750
Still,

468
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:05,750
always.

469
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:08,250
Every time.

470
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Bon Appetit.

471
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Where am I?

472
00:33:23,708 --> 00:33:24,708
What's going on?

473
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:26,791
I'm not coming out of the printer.

474
00:33:30,166 --> 00:33:31,375
I'm still 17.

475
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,250
Why didn't that thing eat me?

476
00:33:36,583 --> 00:33:37,791
I was passed out.

477
00:33:40,583 --> 00:33:41,916
I not look tasty enough.

478
00:33:43,875 --> 00:33:50,375
Oh, got it.

479
00:33:51,541 --> 00:33:53,166
You're saving me for the kiddos.

480
00:33:55,541 --> 00:33:57,916
What a great mom.

481
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:01,291
Oh, please just make it quick.

482
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,041
Come on guys, big bites. Big bites.

483
00:34:06,583 --> 00:34:07,750
Ow!

484
00:34:09,333 --> 00:34:10,583
Where are you taking me now?

485
00:34:11,541 --> 00:34:16,041
Is my meat gone bad
